a
maid
of
chapter
i
very
little
was
known
about
george
the
dalmatian
and
the
servants
in
the
house
of
angelo
beroviero
as
well
as
the
workmen
of
the
glass
furnace
called
him
zorzi
distrusted
him
suggested
that
he
was
probably
a
heretic
and
did
not
hide
their
suspicion
that
he
was
in
love
with
the
master
only
daughter
marietta
all
these
matters
were
against
him
and
people
wondered
why
old
angelo
kept
the
waif
in
his
service
since
he
would
have
engaged
any
one
out
of
a
hundred
young
fellows
of
murano
all
belonging
to
the
almost
noble
caste
of
the
all
good
christians
all
trustworthy
and
all
ready
to
promise
that
the
lovely
marietta
should
never
make
the
slightest
impression
upon
their
respectfully
petrified
hearts
but
angelo
had
not
been
accustomed
to
consider
what
his
neighbours
might
think
of
him
or
his
doings
and
most
of
his
neighbours
and
friends
abstained
with
singular
unanimity
from
thrusting
their
opinions
upon
him
for
this
there
were
three
reasons
he
was
very
rich
he
was
the
greatest
living
artist
in
working
glass
and
he
was
of
a
choleric
temper
he
confessed
the
latter
fault
with
great
humility
to
the
curate
of
san
piero
each
year
in
lent
but
he
would
never
admit
it
to
any
one
else
indeed
if
any
of
his
family
ever
suggested
that
he
was
somewhat
hasty
he
flew
into
such
an
ungovernable
rage
in
proving
the
contrary
that
it
was
scarcely
wise
to
stay
in
the
house
while
the
fit
lasted
marietta
alone
was
safe
as
for
her
brothers
though
the
elder
was
nearly
forty
years
old
it
was
not
long
since
his
father
had
given
him
a
box
on
the
ears
which
made
him
see
simultaneously
all
the
colours
of
all
the
glasses
ever
made
in
murano
before
or
since
it
is
true
that
giovanni
had
timidly
asked
to
be
told
one
of
the
secrets
for
making
fine
red
glass
which
old
angelo
had
learned
long
ago
from
old
paolo
godi
of
pergola
the
famous
chemist
and
these
secrets
were
all
carefully
written
out
in
the
elaborate
character
of
the
late
fifteenth
century
and
angelo
kept
the
manuscript
in
an
iron
box
under
his
own
bed
and
wore
the
key
on
a
small
silver
chain
at
his
neck
he
was
a
big
old
man
with
fiery
brown
eyes
large
features
and
a
very
pale
skin
his
thick
hair
and
short
beard
had
once
been
red
and
streaks
of
the
strong
colour
still
ran
through
the
faded
locks
his
hands
were
large
but
very
skilful
and
the
long
straight
fingers
were
discoloured
by
contact
with
the
substances
he
used
in
his
experiments
he
was
jealous
by
nature
rather
than
suspicious
he
had
been
jealous
of
his
wife
while
she
had
lived
though
a
more
devoted
woman
never
fell
to
the
lot
of
a
lucky
husband
often
for
weeks
together
he
had
locked
the
door
upon
her
and
taken
the
key
with
him
every
morning
when
he
left
the
house
though
his
furnaces
were
almost
exactly
opposite
on
the
other
side
of
the
narrow
canal
so
that
by
coming
to
the
door
he
could
have
spoken
with
her
at
her
window
but
instead
of
doing
this
he
used
to
look
through
a
little
grated
opening
which
he
had
caused
to
be
made
in
the
wall
of
the
and
when
his
wife
was
seated
at
her
window
at
her
embroidery
he
could
watch
her
unseen
for
she
was
beautiful
and
he
loved
her
one
day
he
saw
a
stranger
standing
by
the
water
edge
gazing
at
her
and
he
went
out
and
threw
the
man
into
the
canal
when
she
died
he
said
little
but
he
would
not
allow
his
own
children
to
speak
of
her
before
him
after
that
he
became
almost
as
jealous
of
his
daughter
and
though
he
did
not
lock
her
up
like
her
mother
he
used
to
take
her
with
him
to
the
when
the
weather
was
not
too
hot
so
that
she
should
not
be
out
of
his
sight
all
day
moreover
because
he
needed
a
man
to
help
him
and
because
he
was
afraid
lest
one
of
his
own
caste
should
fall
in
love
with
marietta
he
took
zorzi
the
dalmatian
waif
into
his
service
and
the
three
were
often
together
all
day
in
the
room
where
angelo
had
set
up
a
little
furnace
for
making
experiments
in
the
year
it
was
not
lawful
in
murano
to
teach
any
foreign
person
the
art
of
for
the
were
a
sort
of
nobility
and
nearly
a
hundred
years
had
passed
since
the
council
had
declared
that
patricians
of
venice
might
marry
the
daughters
of
without
affecting
their
own
rank
or
that
of
their
children
but
old
beroviero
declared
that
he
was
not
teaching
zorzi
anything
that
the
young
fellow
was
his
servant
and
not
his
apprentice
and
did
nothing
but
keep
up
the
fire
in
the
furnace
and
fetch
and
carry
grind
materials
and
sweep
the
floor
it
was
quite
true
that
zorzi
did
all
these
things
and
he
did
them
with
a
silent
regularity
that
made
him
indispensable
to
his
master
who
scarcely
noticed
the
growing
skill
with
which
the
young
man
helped
him
at
every
turn
till
he
could
be
entrusted
to
perform
the
most
delicate
operations
in
without
any
especial
instructions
intent
upon
artistic
matters
the
old
man
was
hardly
aware
either
that
marietta
had
learned
much
of
his
art
or
if
he
realised
the
fact
he
felt
a
sort
of
jealous
satisfaction
in
the
thought
that
she
liked
to
be
shut
up
with
him
for
hours
at
a
time
quite
out
of
sight
of
the
world
and
altogether
out
of
harm
way
he
fancied
that
she
grew
more
like
him
from
day
to
day
and
he
flattered
himself
that
he
understood
her
she
and
zorzi
were
the
only
beings
in
his
world
who
never
irritated
him
now
that
he
had
them
always
under
his
eye
and
command
it
was
natural
that
he
should
suppose
himself
to
be
profoundly
acquainted
with
their
two
natures
though
he
had
never
taken
the
smallest
pains
to
test
this
imaginary
knowledge
possibly
in
their
different
ways
they
knew
him
better
than
he
knew
them
the
was
guarded
from
outsiders
as
carefully
as
a
nunnery
and
somewhat
resembled
a
convent
in
having
no
windows
so
situated
that
curious
persons
might
see
from
without
what
went
on
inside
the
place
was
entered
by
a
low
door
from
the
narrow
paved
path
that
ran
along
the
canal
in
a
little
vestibule
by
one
small
grated
window
sat
the
porter
an
uncouth
old
man
who
rarely
answered
questions
and
never
opened
the
door
until
he
had
assured
himself
by
a
deliberate
inspection
through
the
grating
that
the
person
who
knocked
had
a
right
to
come
in
marietta
remembered
him
in
his
den
when
she
had
been
a
little
child
and
she
vaguely
supposed
that
he
had
always
been
there
he
had
been
old
then
he
was
not
visibly
older
now
he
would
probably
never
die
of
old
age
and
if
any
mortal
ill
should
carry
him
off
he
would
surely
be
replaced
by
some
one
exactly
like
him
who
would
sleep
in
the
same
box
bed
sit
all
day
in
the
same
black
chair
and
eat
bread
shellfish
and
garlic
off
the
same
table
there
was
no
other
entrance
to
the
and
there
could
be
no
other
porter
to
guard
it
beyond
the
vestibule
a
dark
corridor
led
to
a
small
garden
that
formed
the
court
of
the
building
and
on
one
side
of
which
were
the
large
windows
that
lighted
the
main
furnace
room
while
the
other
side
contained
the
laboratory
of
the
master
but
the
main
furnace
was
entered
from
the
corridor
so
that
the
workmen
never
passed
through
the
garden
there
were
a
few
shrubs
in
it
two
or
three
and
a
small
zorzi
who
had
been
born
and
brought
up
in
the
country
had
made
a
couple
of
edged
with
refuse
fragments
of
coloured
and
iridescent
slag
and
he
had
planted
such
common
flowers
as
he
could
make
grow
in
such
a
place
watering
them
from
a
disused
cistern
that
was
supposed
to
have
been
poisoned
long
ago
here
marietta
often
sat
in
the
shade
when
the
laboratory
was
too
close
and
hot
and
when
the
time
was
at
hand
during
which
even
the
men
would
not
be
able
to
work
on
account
of
the
heat
and
the
furnace
would
be
put
out
and
repaired
and
every
one
would
be
set
to
making
the
delicate
clay
pots
in
which
the
glass
was
to
be
melted
marietta
could
sit
silent
and
motionless
in
her
seat
under
the
for
a
long
time
when
she
was
thinking
and
she
never
told
any
one
her
thoughts
she
was
not
unlike
her
father
in
looks
and
that
was
doubtless
the
reason
why
he
assumed
that
she
must
be
like
him
in
character
no
one
would
have
said
that
she
was
handsome
but
sometimes
when
she
smiled
those
who
saw
that
rare
expression
in
her
face
thought
she
was
beautiful
when
it
was
gone
they
said
she
was
cold
fortunately
her
hair
was
not
red
as
her
father
had
been
or
she
might
sometimes
have
seemed
positively
ugly
it
was
of
that
deep
ruddy
golden
brown
that
one
may
often
see
in
venice
still
and
there
was
an
abundance
of
it
though
it
was
drawn
straight
back
from
her
white
forehead
and
braided
into
the
smallest
possible
space
in
the
fashion
of
that
time
there
was
often
a
little
colour
in
her
face
though
never
much
and
it
was
faint
yet
very
fresh
like
the
tint
within
certain
delicate
shells
her
lips
were
of
the
same
hue
but
stronger
and
brighter
and
they
were
very
well
shaped
and
generally
closed
like
her
father
but
her
eyes
were
not
like
his
and
the
lids
and
lashes
shaded
them
in
such
a
way
that
it
was
hard
to
guess
their
colour
and
they
had
an
inscrutable
reserved
look
that
was
hard
to
meet
for
many
seconds
zorzi
believed
that
they
were
grey
but
when
he
saw
them
in
his
dreams
they
were
violet
and
one
day
she
opened
them
wide
for
an
instant
at
something
old
beroviero
said
to
her
and
then
zorzi
fancied
that
they
were
like
sapphires
but
before
he
could
be
sure
the
lids
and
lashes
shaded
them
again
and
he
only
knew
that
they
were
there
and
longed
to
see
them
for
her
father
had
spoken
of
her
marriage
and
she
had
not
answered
a
single
word
when
they
were
alone
together
for
a
moment
while
the
old
man
was
searching
for
more
materials
in
the
next
room
she
spoke
to
zorzi
my
father
did
not
mean
you
to
hear
that
she
said
nevertheless
i
heard
answered
zorzi
pushing
a
small
piece
of
beech
wood
into
the
fire
through
a
narrow
slit
on
one
side
of
the
brick
furnace
it
was
not
my
fault
forget
that
you
heard
it
said
marietta
quietly
and
as
her
father
entered
the
room
again
she
passed
him
and
went
out
into
the
garden
but
zorzi
did
not
even
try
to
forget
the
name
of
the
man
whom
beroviero
appeared
to
have
chosen
for
his
daughter
he
tried
instead
to
understand
why
marietta
wished
him
not
to
remember
that
the
name
was
jacopo
contarini
he
glanced
sideways
at
the
girl
figure
as
she
disappeared
through
the
door
and
he
thoughtfully
pushed
another
piece
of
wood
into
the
fire
some
day
perhaps
before
long
she
would
marry
this
man
who
had
been
mentioned
and
then
zorzi
would
be
alone
with
old
beroviero
in
the
laboratory
he
set
his
teeth
and
poked
the
fire
with
an
iron
rod
it
happened
now
and
then
that
marietta
did
not
come
to
the
those
days
were
long
and
when
night
came
zorzi
felt
as
if
his
heart
were
turning
into
a
hot
stone
in
his
breast
and
his
sight
was
dull
and
he
ached
from
his
work
and
felt
scorched
by
the
heat
of
the
furnace
for
he
was
not
very
strong
of
limb
though
he
was
quick
with
his
hands
and
of
a
very
tenacious
nature
able
to
endure
pain
as
well
as
weariness
when
he
was
determined
to
finish
what
he
had
begun
but
while
marietta
was
in
the
laboratory
nothing
could
tire
him
nor
hurt
him
nor
make
him
wish
that
the
hours
were
less
long
he
thought
therefore
of
what
must
happen
to
him
if
jacopo
contarini
took
marietta
away
from
murano
to
live
in
a
palace
in
venice
and
he
determined
at
least
to
find
out
what
sort
of
man
this
might
be
who
was
to
receive
for
his
own
the
only
woman
in
the
world
for
whose
sake
it
would
be
perfect
happiness
to
be
burned
with
slow
fire
he
did
not
mean
to
do
contarini
any
harm
perhaps
marietta
already
loved
the
man
and
was
glad
she
was
to
marry
him
no
one
could
have
told
what
she
felt
even
from
that
one
flashing
look
she
had
given
her
father
zorzi
did
not
try
to
understand
her
yet
he
only
loved
her
and
she
was
his
master
daughter
and
if
his
master
found
out
his
secret
it
would
be
a
very
evil
day
for
him
so
he
poked
the
fire
with
his
iron
rod
and
set
his
teeth
and
said
nothing
while
old
beroviero
moved
about
the
room
zorzi
said
the
master
presently
i
meant
you
to
hear
what
i
said
to
my
daughter
i
heard
sir
answered
the
young
man
rising
respectfully
and
waiting
for
more
remember
the
name
you
heard
said
beroviero
if
the
matter
had
been
any
other
in
the
world
zorzi
would
have
smiled
at
the
master
words
because
they
bade
him
do
just
what
marietta
had
forbidden
the
one
said
forget
the
other
remember
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
zorzi
found
it
easier
to
obey
his
lady
father
than
herself
he
bent
his
head
respectfully
i
trust
you
zorzi
continued
beroviero
slowly
mixing
some
materials
in
a
little
wooden
trough
on
the
table
i
trust
you
because
i
must
trust
some
one
in
order
to
have
a
safe
means
of
communicating
with
casa
contarini
again
zorzi
bent
his
head
but
still
he
said
nothing
these
five
years
you
have
worked
with
me
in
private
the
old
man
went
on
and
i
know
that
you
have
not
told
what
you
have
seen
me
do
though
there
are
many
who
would
pay
you
good
money
to
know
what
i
have
been
about
that
is
true
answered
zorzi
yes
i
therefore
judge
that
you
are
one
of
those
unusual
beings
whom
god
has
sent
into
the
world
to
be
of
use
to
their
instead
of
a
hindrance
for
you
possess
the
power
of
holding
your
tongue
which
i
had
almost
believed
to
be
extinct
in
the
human
race
i
am
going
to
send
you
on
an
errand
to
venice
to
jacopo
cantarini
if
i
sent
any
one
from
my
house
all
murano
would
know
it
morning
but
i
wish
no
one
here
to
guess
where
you
have
been
no
one
shall
see
me
answered
zorzi
tell
me
only
where
i
am
to
go
you
know
venice
well
by
this
time
you
must
have
often
passed
the
house
of
the
agnus
dei
by
the
baker
bridge
yes
go
there
alone
and
ask
for
messer
jacopo
and
if
the
porter
inquires
your
business
say
that
you
have
a
message
and
a
token
from
a
certain
angelo
when
you
are
admitted
and
are
alone
with
messer
jacopo
tell
him
from
me
to
go
and
stand
by
the
second
pillar
on
the
left
in
saint
mark
on
sunday
next
an
hour
before
noon
until
he
sees
me
and
within
a
week
after
that
he
shall
have
the
answer
and
bid
him
be
silent
if
he
would
succeed
is
that
all
sir
that
is
all
if
he
gives
you
any
message
in
answer
deliver
it
to
me
when
my
daughter
is
not
here
and
the
token
inquired
zorzi
this
glass
seal
of
which
he
already
has
an
impression
in
wax
in
case
he
should
doubt
you
zorzi
took
the
little
leathern
bag
which
contained
the
seal
he
tied
a
piece
of
string
to
it
and
hung
it
round
his
neck
so
that
it
was
hidden
in
his
doublet
like
a
charm
or
a
scapulary
beroviero
watched
him
and
nodded
in
approval
do
not
start
before
it
is
quite
dark
he
said
take
the
little
skiff
the
water
will
be
high
two
hours
before
midnight
so
you
will
have
no
trouble
in
getting
across
when
you
come
back
come
here
and
tell
the
porter
that
i
have
ordered
you
to
see
that
my
fire
is
properly
kept
up
then
go
to
sleep
in
the
coolest
place
you
can
find
after
beroviero
had
given
him
these
orders
zorzi
had
plenty
of
time
for
reflection
for
his
master
said
nothing
more
and
became
absorbed
in
his
work
weighing
out
portions
of
different
ingredients
and
slowly
mixing
each
with
the
coloured
earths
and
chemicals
that
were
already
in
the
wooden
trough
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
tend
the
fire
and
zorzi
pushed
in
the
pieces
of
istrian
beech
wood
with
his
usual
industrious
regularity
it
was
the
only
part
of
his
work
which
he
hated
and
when
he
was
obliged
to
do
nothing
else
he
usually
sought
consolation
in
dreaming
of
a
time
when
he
himself
should
be
a
master
and
artist
whom
it
would
be
almost
an
honour
for
a
young
man
to
serve
even
in
such
a
humble
way
he
did
not
know
how
that
was
to
happen
since
there
were
strict
laws
against
teaching
the
art
to
foreigners
and
also
against
allowing
any
foreign
person
to
establish
a
furnace
at
murano
and
the
glass
works
had
long
been
altogether
banished
from
venice
on
account
of
the
danger
of
fire
at
a
time
when
of
the
houses
were
of
wood
but
meanwhile
zorzi
had
learned
the
art
in
spite
of
the
law
and
he
hoped
in
time
to
overcome
the
other
obstacles
that
opposed
him
there
was
strength
of
purpose
in
every
line
of
his
keen
young
face
strength
to
endure
to
forego
to
suffer
in
silence
for
an
end
ardently
desired
the
dark
brown
hair
grew
somewhat
far
back
from
the
pale
forehead
the
features
were
youthfully
sharp
and
clearly
drawn
and
deep
neutral
shadows
gave
a
look
of
almost
passionate
sadness
to
the
black
eyes
there
was
quick
perception
imagination
love
of
art
for
its
own
sake
in
the
upper
part
of
the
face
its
strength
lay
in
the
jaw
and
firm
lips
and
a
little
in
the
graceful
and
assured
poise
of
the
head
zorzi
was
not
tall
but
he
was
shapely
and
moved
without
effort
his
eyes
were
sadder
than
usual
just
now
as
he
tended
the
fire
in
the
silence
that
was
broken
only
by
the
low
roar
of
the
flames
within
the
brick
furnace
and
the
irregular
sound
of
the
master
wooden
instrument
as
he
crushed
and
stirred
the
materials
together
zorzi
had
longed
to
see
contarini
as
soon
as
he
had
heard
his
name
and
having
unexpectedly
obtained
the
certainty
of
seeing
him
that
very
night
he
wished
that
the
moment
could
be
put
off
he
felt
cold
and
hot
he
wondered
how
he
should
behave
and
whether
after
all
he
might
not
be
tempted
to
do
his
enemy
some
bodily
harm
for
in
a
few
minutes
the
aspect
of
his
world
had
changed
and
contarini
unknown
figure
filled
the
future
until
he
had
never
seriously
thought
of
marietta
marriage
nor
of
what
would
happen
to
him
afterwards
but
now
he
was
to
be
one
of
the
instruments
for
bringing
the
marriage
about
he
knew
well
enough
what
the
appointment
in
saint
mark
meant
marietta
was
to
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
contarini
before
accepting
him
even
that
was
something
of
a
concession
in
those
times
but
beroviero
fancied
that
he
loved
his
child
too
much
to
marry
her
against
her
will
this
was
probably
a
great
match
for
the
daughter
however
and
she
would
not
refuse
it
contarini
had
never
seen
her
either
he
might
have
heard
that
she
was
a
pretty
girl
but
there
were
famous
beauties
in
venice
and
if
he
wanted
marietta
beroviero
it
could
only
be
for
her
dowry
the
marriage
was
therefore
a
mere
bargain
between
the
two
men
in
which
a
name
was
bartered
for
a
fortune
and
a
fortune
for
a
name
zorzi
saw
how
absurd
it
was
to
suppose
that
marietta
could
care
for
a
man
whom
she
had
never
even
seen
and
worse
than
that
he
guessed
in
a
flash
of
loving
intuition
how
wretchedly
unhappy
she
might
be
with
him
and
he
hated
and
despised
the
errand
he
was
to
perform
the
future
seemed
to
reveal
itself
to
him
with
the
long
martyrdom
of
the
woman
he
loved
and
he
felt
an
almost
irresistible
desire
to
go
to
her
and
implore
her
to
refuse
to
be
sold
of
the
marriages
he
had
ever
heard
of
in
murano
or
venice
had
been
made
in
this
way
and
in
a
moment
reflection
he
realised
the
folly
of
appealing
even
to
the
girl
herself
who
doubtless
looked
upon
the
whole
proceeding
as
perfectly
natural
she
had
of
course
expected
such
an
event
ever
since
she
had
been
a
child
she
was
prepared
to
accept
it
and
she
only
hoped
that
her
husband
might
turn
out
to
be
young
handsome
and
noble
since
she
did
not
want
money
a
moment
later
zorzi
included
all
marriageable
young
women
in
one
sweeping
condemnation
they
were
all
mercenary
vain
deceitful
anything
that
suggested
itself
to
his
headlong
resentment
art
was
the
only
thing
worth
living
and
dying
for
the
world
was
full
of
women
and
they
were
all
alike
old
young
ugly
handsome
all
a
pack
of
heartless
jades
but
art
was
one
beautiful
true
deathless
and
unchanging
he
looked
up
from
the
furnace
door
and
he
felt
the
blood
rush
to
his
face
marietta
was
standing
near
and
watching
him
with
her
strangely
veiled
eyes
poor
zorzi
she
exclaimed
in
a
soft
voice
how
hot
you
look
he
did
not
remember
that
he
had
ever
cared
a
straw
whether
any
one
noticed
that
he
was
hot
or
not
until
that
moment
but
for
some
complicated
reason
connected
with
his
own
thoughts
the
remark
stung
him
like
an
insult
and
fully
confirmed
his
recent
verdict
concerning
women
in
general
and
their
total
lack
of
all
human
kindness
where
men
were
concerned
he
rose
to
his
feet
suddenly
and
turned
away
without
a
word
come
out
into
the
garden
said
marietta
do
you
need
zorzi
just
now
she
asked
turning
to
her
father
who
only
shook
his
head
by
way
of
answer
for
he
was
very
busy
but
i
assure
you
that
i
am
not
too
hot
answered
zorzi
why
should
i
go
out
because
i
want
you
to
fasten
up
one
of
the
branches
of
the
red
rose
it
catches
in
my
skirt
every
time
i
pass
you
will
need
a
hammer
and
a
little
nail
she
had
not
been
thinking
of
his
comfort
after
all
thought
zorzi
as
he
got
the
hammer
she
had
only
wanted
something
done
for
herself
he
might
have
known
it
but
for
the
rose
that
caught
in
her
skirt
he
might
have
roasted
alive
at
the
furnace
before
she
would
have
noticed
that
he
was
hot
he
followed
her
out
she
led
him
to
the
end
of
the
walk
farthest
from
the
door
of
the
laboratory
the
sun
was
low
and
all
the
little
garden
was
in
deep
shade
a
branch
of
the
lay
across
the
path
and
zorzi
thought
it
looked
very
much
as
if
it
had
been
pulled
down
on
purpose
she
pointed
to
it
and
as
he
carefully
lifted
it
from
the
ground
she
spoke
quickly
in
a
low
tone
what
was
my
father
saying
to
you
a
while
ago
she
asked
zorzi
held
up
the
branch
in
his
hand
ready
to
fasten
it
against
the
wall
and
looked
at
her
he
saw
at
a
glance
that
she
had
brought
him
out
to
ask
the
question
the
master
was
giving
me
certain
orders
he
said
he
rarely
makes
such
long
speeches
when
he
gives
orders
observed
the
girl
his
instructions
were
very
particular
will
you
not
tell
me
what
they
were
zorzi
turned
slowly
from
her
and
let
the
long
branch
rest
on
the
bush
while
he
began
to
drive
a
nail
into
the
wall
marietta
watched
him
why
do
you
not
answer
me
she
asked
because
i
can
not
he
said
briefly
because
you
will
not
you
mean
as
you
choose
zorzi
went
on
striking
the
nail
i
am
sorry
answered
the
young
girl
i
really
wish
to
know
very
much
besides
if
you
will
tell
me
i
will
give
you
something
zorzi
turned
upon
her
suddenly
with
angry
eyes
if
money
could
buy
your
father
secrets
from
me
i
should
be
a
rich
man
by
this
time
i
think
i
know
as
much
of
my
father
secrets
as
you
do
answered
marietta
more
coldly
and
i
did
not
mean
to
offer
you
money
what
then
but
as
he
asked
the
question
zorzi
turned
away
again
and
began
to
fasten
the
branch
marietta
did
not
answer
at
once
but
she
idly
picked
a
rose
from
the
bush
and
put
it
to
her
lips
to
breathe
in
its
freshness
why
should
you
think
that
i
meant
to
insult
you
she
asked
gently
i
am
only
a
servant
after
all
answered
zorzi
with
unnecessary
bitterness
why
should
you
not
insult
your
servants
if
you
please
it
would
be
quite
natural
would
it
even
if
you
were
really
a
servant
it
seems
quite
natural
to
you
that
i
should
betray
your
confidence
i
do
not
see
much
difference
between
taking
it
for
granted
that
a
man
is
a
traitor
and
offering
him
money
to
act
as
one
no
said
marietta
smelling
the
rose
from
time
to
time
as
she
spoke
there
is
not
much
difference
but
i
did
not
mean
to
hurt
your
feelings
you
did
not
realise
that
i
could
have
any
i
fancy
retorted
zorzi
still
angry
perhaps
i
did
not
understand
that
you
would
consider
what
my
father
was
telling
you
in
the
same
light
as
a
secret
of
the
art
said
marietta
slowly
nor
that
you
would
look
upon
what
i
meant
to
offer
you
as
a
bribe
the
matter
concerned
me
did
it
not
your
name
was
not
spoken
i
have
fastened
the
branch
is
there
anything
else
for
me
to
do
have
you
no
curiosity
to
know
what
i
would
have
given
you
asked
marietta
i
should
be
ashamed
to
want
anything
at
such
a
price
returned
zorzi
proudly
you
hold
your
honour
high
even
in
trifles
it
is
all
i
have
my
honour
and
my
art
you
care
for
nothing
else
nothing
else
in
the
whole
world
nothing
said
zorzi
you
must
be
very
lonely
in
your
thoughts
she
said
and
turned
away
as
she
went
slowly
along
the
path
her
hand
hung
by
her
side
and
the
rose
she
held
fell
from
her
fingers
following
her
at
a
short
distance
on
his
way
back
to
the
laboratory
zorzi
stooped
and
picked
up
the
flower
not
thinking
that
she
would
turn
her
head
but
at
that
moment
she
had
reached
the
door
and
she
looked
back
and
saw
what
he
had
done
she
stood
still
and
held
out
her
hand
expecting
him
to
come
up
with
her
my
rose
she
exclaimed
as
if
surprised
give
it
back
to
me
zorzi
gave
it
to
her
and
the
colour
came
to
his
face
a
second
time
she
fastened
it
in
her
bodice
looking
down
at
it
as
she
did
so
i
am
so
fond
of
roses
she
said
smiling
a
little
are
you
i
planted
all
those
you
have
here
he
answered
yes
i
know
she
looked
up
as
she
spoke
and
met
his
eyes
and
all
at
once
she
laughed
not
unkindly
nor
as
if
at
him
nor
at
what
he
had
said
but
quietly
and
happily
as
women
do
when
they
have
got
what
they
want
zorzi
did
not
understand
you
are
gay
he
said
coldly
do
you
wonder
she
asked
if
you
knew
what
i
know
you
would
understand
but
i
do
not
zorzi
went
back
to
his
furnace
marietta
exchanged
a
few
words
with
her
father
and
left
the
room
again
to
go
home
in
the
garden
she
paused
a
moment
by
the
where
she
had
talked
with
zorzi
but
there
was
not
even
the
shadow
of
a
smile
in
her
face
now
she
went
down
the
dark
corridor
and
called
the
porter
who
roused
himself
opened
the
door
and
hailed
the
house
opposite
a
woman
looked
out
in
the
evening
light
nodded
and
disappeared
a
few
seconds
later
she
came
out
of
the
house
a
quiet
little
creature
in
brown
with
intelligent
eyes
and
she
crossed
the
shaky
wooden
bridge
over
the
canal
to
come
and
bring
marietta
home
it
would
have
been
a
scandalous
thing
if
the
daughter
of
angelo
beroviero
had
been
seen
by
the
neighbours
to
walk
a
score
of
paces
in
the
street
without
an
attendant
she
had
thrown
a
hood
of
dark
green
cloth
over
her
head
and
the
folds
hung
below
her
shoulders
half
hiding
her
graceful
figure
her
step
was
smooth
and
deliberate
while
the
little
brown
trotted
beside
her
across
the
wooden
bridge
the
house
of
angelo
beroviero
hung
over
the
paved
way
above
the
edge
of
the
water
the
upper
story
being
supported
by
six
stone
columns
and
massive
wooden
beams
forming
a
sort
of
portico
which
was
at
the
same
time
a
public
thoroughfare
but
as
the
house
was
not
far
from
the
end
of
the
canal
of
san
piero
which
opens
towards
venice
few
people
passed
that
way
marietta
paused
a
moment
while
the
woman
held
the
door
open
for
her
the
sun
had
just
set
and
the
salt
freshness
that
comes
with
the
rising
tide
was
already
in
the
air
i
wish
i
were
in
venice
this
evening
she
said
almost
to
herself
the
looked
at
her
suspiciously
chapter
ii
the
june
night
was
dark
and
warm
as
zorzi
pushed
off
from
the
steps
before
his
master
house
and
guided
his
skiff
through
the
canal
scarcely
moving
the
single
oar
as
the
rising
tide
took
his
boat
silently
along
it
was
not
until
he
had
passed
the
last
of
the
on
his
right
and
was
already
in
the
lagoon
that
separates
murano
from
venice
that
he
began
to
row
gently
at
first
for
fear
of
being
heard
by
some
one
ashore
and
then
more
quickly
swinging
his
oar
in
the
curved
crutch
with
that
skilful
serpentine
stroke
which
is
neither
rowing
nor
sculling
but
which
has
all
the
advantages
of
both
for
it
is
swift
and
silent
and
needs
scarcely
to
be
slackened
even
in
a
channel
so
narrow
that
the
boat
itself
can
barely
pass
now
that
he
was
away
from
the
houses
the
stars
came
out
and
he
felt
the
pleasant
land
breeze
in
his
face
meeting
the
rising
tide
not
a
boat
was
out
upon
the
shallow
lagoon
but
his
own
not
a
sound
came
from
the
town
behind
him
but
as
the
flat
bow
of
the
skiff
gently
slapped
the
water
it
plashed
and
purled
with
every
stroke
of
the
oar
and
a
faint
murmur
of
voices
in
song
was
borne
to
him
on
the
wind
from
the
still
waking
city
he
stood
upright
on
the
high
stern
of
the
shadowy
craft
himself
but
a
moving
shadow
in
the
starlight
thrown
forward
now
and
now
once
more
erect
in
changing
motion
and
as
he
moved
the
same
thought
came
back
and
back
again
in
a
sort
of
halting
and
painful
rhythm
he
was
out
that
night
on
a
bad
errand
it
said
helping
to
sell
the
life
of
the
woman
he
loved
and
what
he
was
doing
could
never
be
undone
again
and
again
the
words
said
themselves
the
voices
said
them
the
lapping
water
took
them
up
and
repeated
them
the
breeze
whispered
them
quickly
as
it
passed
the
oar
pronounced
them
as
it
creaked
softly
in
the
crutch
rowlock
the
stars
spelled
out
the
sentences
in
the
sky
the
lights
of
venice
wrote
them
in
the
water
in
broken
reflections
he
was
not
alone
any
more
for
everything
in
heaven
and
earth
was
crying
to
him
to
go
back
that
was
folly
and
he
knew
it
the
master
who
had
trusted
him
would
drive
him
out
of
his
house
and
out
of
venetian
land
and
water
too
if
he
chose
and
he
should
never
see
marietta
again
and
she
would
be
married
to
contarini
just
as
if
zorzi
had
taken
the
message
besides
it
was
the
custom
of
the
world
everywhere
so
far
as
he
knew
that
marriage
and
money
should
be
spoken
of
in
the
same
breath
and
there
was
no
reason
why
his
master
should
make
an
exception
and
be
different
from
other
men
he
could
put
some
hindrance
in
the
way
of
course
if
he
chose
to
interfere
for
he
could
deliver
the
message
wrong
and
contarini
would
go
to
the
church
in
the
afternoon
instead
of
in
the
morning
he
smiled
grimly
in
the
dark
as
he
thought
of
the
young
nobleman
waiting
for
an
hour
or
two
beside
the
pillar
to
be
looked
at
by
some
one
who
never
came
then
catching
sight
at
last
of
some
ugly
old
maid
of
forty
protected
by
her
servant
ogling
him
while
she
said
her
prayers
and
filling
him
with
horror
at
the
thought
that
she
must
be
marietta
beroviero
all
that
might
happen
but
it
must
inevitably
be
found
out
the
misunderstanding
would
be
cleared
away
and
the
marriage
would
be
arranged
after
all
he
had
rested
on
his
oar
to
think
and
now
he
struck
it
deep
into
the
black
water
and
the
skiff
shot
ahead
he
would
have
a
far
better
chance
of
serving
marietta
in
the
future
if
he
obeyed
his
master
and
delivered
his
message
exactly
for
he
should
see
contarini
himself
and
judge
of
him
in
the
first
place
and
that
alone
was
worth
much
and
afterwards
there
would
be
time
enough
for
desperate
resolutions
he
hastened
his
stroke
and
when
he
ran
under
the
shadow
of
the
overhanging
houses
his
mood
changed
and
he
grew
hopeful
as
many
young
men
do
out
of
sheer
curiosity
as
to
what
was
before
him
and
out
of
the
wish
to
meet
something
or
somebody
that
should
put
his
own
strength
to
the
test
it
was
not
far
now
with
infinite
caution
he
threaded
the
dark
canals
thanking
fortune
for
the
faint
starlight
that
showed
him
the
turnings
here
and
there
a
small
oil
lamp
burned
before
the
image
of
a
saint
from
a
narrow
lane
on
one
side
the
light
streamed
across
the
water
and
with
it
came
sounds
of
ringing
glasses
and
the
tinkling
of
a
lute
and
laughing
voices
then
it
was
dark
again
as
his
skiff
shot
by
and
he
made
haste
for
he
wished
not
to
be
seen
presently
and
somewhat
to
his
surprise
he
saw
a
gondola
before
him
in
a
narrow
place
rowed
slowly
by
a
man
who
seemed
to
be
in
black
like
himself
he
did
not
try
to
pass
it
but
kept
a
little
astern
trying
not
to
attract
attention
and
hoping
that
it
would
turn
aside
into
another
canal
but
it
went
steadily
on
before
him
turning
wherever
he
must
turn
till
it
stopped
where
he
was
to
stop
at
the
of
the
house
of
the
agnus
dei
instantly
he
brought
to
in
the
shadow
with
the
instinctive
caution
of
every
one
who
is
used
to
the
water
gondolas
were
few
in
those
days
and
belonged
only
to
the
rich
who
had
just
begun
to
use
them
as
a
means
of
getting
about
quickly
much
more
convenient
than
horses
or
mules
for
when
riding
a
man
often
had
to
go
far
out
of
his
way
to
reach
a
bridge
and
there
were
many
canals
that
had
no
bridle
path
at
all
and
where
the
wooden
houses
were
built
straight
down
into
the
water
as
the
stone
ones
are
zorzi
peered
through
the
darkness
and
listened
the
occupant
of
the
gondola
might
be
contarini
himself
coming
home
whoever
it
was
tapped
softly
upon
the
door
which
was
instantly
opened
but
to
zorzi
surprise
no
light
shone
from
the
entrance
all
the
house
above
was
still
and
dark
and
he
could
barely
make
out
by
the
starlight
the
piece
of
white
marble
bearing
the
sculptured
agnus
dei
whence
the
house
takes
its
name
he
knew
that
above
the
high
balcony
there
were
graceful
columns
bearing
pointed
stone
arches
between
which
are
the
symbols
of
the
four
evangelists
but
he
could
see
nothing
of
them
only
on
the
balcony
he
fancied
he
saw
something
less
dark
than
the
wall
or
the
sky
and
which
might
be
a
woman
dress
some
one
got
out
of
the
gondola
and
went
in
after
speaking
a
few
words
in
a
low
tone
and
the
door
was
then
shut
without
noise
the
gondola
glided
on
under
the
baker
bridge
but
zorzi
could
not
see
whether
it
went
further
or
not
he
thought
he
heard
the
sound
of
the
oar
as
if
it
were
going
away
coming
alongside
the
step
he
knocked
gently
as
the
last
comer
had
done
and
the
door
opened
again
he
had
already
made
his
skiff
fast
to
the
step
your
business
here
asked
a
muffled
voice
out
of
the
dark
zorzi
felt
that
a
number
of
persons
were
in
the
hall
immediately
behind
the
speaker
for
the
lord
jacopo
contarini
he
answered
i
have
a
message
and
a
token
to
deliver
from
whom
i
will
tell
that
to
his
lordship
replied
zorzi
i
am
contarini
replied
the
voice
and
the
speaker
felt
for
face
in
the
darkness
and
brought
it
near
his
ear
from
angelo
whispered
zorzi
so
softly
that
contarini
only
heard
the
last
word
the
door
was
now
shut
as
noiselessly
as
before
but
not
by
contarini
himself
he
still
kept
his
hold
on
zorzi
arm
the
token
he
whispered
impatiently
zorzi
pulled
the
little
leathern
bag
out
of
his
doublet
slipped
the
string
over
his
head
and
thrust
the
token
into
contarini
hand
the
latter
uttered
a
low
exclamation
of
surprise
what
is
this
he
asked
the
token
answered
zorzi
he
had
scarcely
spoken
when
he
felt
contarini
arms
round
him
holding
him
fast
he
was
wise
enough
to
make
no
attempt
to
escape
from
them
friends
said
contarini
quickly
the
man
who
just
came
in
is
a
spy
i
am
holding
him
help
me
it
seemed
to
zorzi
that
a
hundred
hands
seized
him
in
the
dark
by
the
arms
by
the
legs
by
the
body
by
the
head
he
knew
that
resistance
was
worse
than
useless
there
were
hands
at
his
throat
too
let
us
do
nothing
hastily
said
contarini
voice
close
beside
him
we
must
find
out
what
he
knows
first
we
can
make
him
speak
i
daresay
we
are
not
hangmen
to
torture
a
prisoner
till
he
confesses
observed
some
one
in
a
quiet
and
rather
indolent
tone
strangle
him
quickly
and
throw
him
into
the
canal
it
is
late
already
no
answered
contarini
let
us
at
least
see
his
face
we
may
know
him
if
you
cry
out
he
said
to
zorzi
you
will
be
killed
instantly
jacopo
is
right
said
some
one
who
had
not
spoken
yet
almost
at
the
same
instant
a
door
was
opened
and
a
broad
bar
of
light
shot
across
the
hall
from
an
inner
room
zorzi
was
roughly
dragged
towards
it
and
he
saw
that
he
was
surrounded
by
about
twenty
masked
men
his
face
was
held
to
the
light
and
contarini
hold
on
his
throat
relaxed
not
even
a
mask
exclaimed
jacopo
a
fool
or
a
madman
speak
man
i
who
are
you
who
sent
you
here
my
name
is
zorzi
answered
the
with
difficulty
for
he
had
been
almost
choked
my
business
is
with
the
lord
jacopo
alone
it
is
very
private
i
have
no
secrets
from
my
friends
said
contarini
speak
as
if
we
were
alone
i
have
promised
my
master
to
deliver
the
message
in
secret
i
will
not
speak
here
strangle
him
and
throw
him
out
suggested
the
man
with
the
indolent
voice
his
master
is
the
devil
i
have
no
doubt
he
can
take
the
message
back
with
him
two
or
three
laughed
these
spies
seldom
hunt
alone
remarked
another
while
we
are
wasting
time
a
dozen
more
may
be
guarding
the
entrance
to
the
house
i
am
no
spy
said
zorzi
what
are
you
then
a
of
murano
contarini
hands
relaxed
altogether
now
and
he
bent
his
ear
to
zorzi
lips
whisper
your
message
he
said
quickly
zorzi
obeyed
angelo
beroviero
bids
you
wait
by
the
second
pillar
on
the
left
in
saint
mark
church
next
sunday
morning
at
one
hour
before
noon
till
you
shall
see
him
and
in
a
week
from
that
time
you
shall
have
an
answer
and
be
silent
if
you
would
succeed
very
well
answered
contarini
friends
he
said
standing
erect
it
is
a
message
i
have
expected
the
name
of
the
man
who
sends
it
is
you
understand
it
is
not
this
fellow
fault
that
he
came
here
this
evening
i
suppose
there
is
a
woman
in
the
case
said
the
indolent
man
we
will
respect
your
secret
put
the
poor
devil
out
of
his
misery
and
let
us
come
to
our
business
kill
an
innocent
man
exclaimed
contarini
yes
since
a
word
from
him
can
send
us
all
to
die
between
the
two
red
columns
his
master
is
powerful
and
rich
said
jacopo
if
the
fellow
does
not
go
back
there
will
be
trouble
and
since
he
was
sent
to
my
house
the
inquiry
will
begin
here
that
is
true
said
more
than
one
voice
in
a
tone
of
hesitation
zorzi
was
very
pale
but
he
held
his
head
high
facing
the
light
of
the
tall
wax
candles
on
the
table
around
which
his
captors
were
standing
he
was
hopelessly
at
their
mercy
for
they
were
twenty
to
one
the
door
had
been
shut
and
barred
and
the
only
window
in
the
room
was
high
above
the
floor
and
covered
by
a
thick
curtain
he
understood
perfectly
that
by
the
accident
of
angelo
name
angel
being
the
password
of
the
company
he
had
been
accidentally
admitted
to
the
meeting
of
some
secret
society
and
from
what
had
been
said
he
guessed
that
its
object
was
a
conspiracy
against
the
republic
it
was
clear
that
in
they
would
most
probably
kill
him
since
they
could
not
reasonably
run
the
risk
of
trusting
their
lives
in
his
hands
they
looked
at
each
other
as
if
silently
debating
what
they
should
do
at
first
you
suggested
that
we
should
torture
him
sneered
the
indolent
man
and
now
you
tremble
like
a
girl
at
the
idea
of
killing
him
listen
to
me
jacopo
if
you
think
that
i
will
leave
this
house
while
this
fellow
is
alive
you
are
most
egregiously
mistaken
he
had
drawn
his
dagger
while
he
was
speaking
and
before
he
had
finished
it
was
dangerously
near
zorzi
throat
contarini
retired
a
step
as
if
not
daring
to
defend
the
prisoner
whose
assailant
in
spite
of
his
careless
and
almost
womanish
tone
was
clearly
a
man
of
action
zorzi
looked
fearlessly
into
the
eyes
that
peered
at
him
through
the
holes
in
the
mask
it
is
curious
observed
the
other
he
does
not
seem
to
be
afraid
i
am
sorry
for
you
my
man
for
you
appear
to
be
a
fine
fellow
and
i
like
your
face
but
we
can
not
possibly
let
you
go
out
of
the
house
alive
if
you
choose
to
trust
me
said
zorzi
calmly
i
will
not
betray
you
but
of
course
it
must
seem
safer
for
you
to
kill
me
i
quite
understand
if
anything
he
is
cooler
than
venier
observed
one
of
the
company
he
does
not
believe
that
we
are
in
earnest
said
contarini
i
am
answered
venier
now
my
man
he
said
addressing
zorzi
again
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
for
you
or
your
family
after
your
death
without
risking
my
neck
i
will
do
it
with
pleasure
i
have
no
family
but
i
thank
you
for
your
offer
in
return
for
your
courtesy
i
warn
you
that
my
master
skiff
is
fast
to
the
step
of
the
house
it
might
be
recognised
when
you
have
killed
me
you
had
better
cast
it
off
it
will
drift
away
with
the
tide
venier
who
had
let
the
point
of
his
long
dagger
rest
against
collar
suddenly
dropped
it
contarini
he
said
i
take
back
what
i
said
it
would
be
an
abominable
shame
to
murder
a
man
as
brave
as
he
is
a
murmur
of
approval
came
from
all
the
company
but
contarini
whose
vacillating
nature
showed
itself
at
every
turn
was
now
inclined
to
take
the
other
side
he
may
ruin
us
all
he
said
one
word
it
seems
to
me
interrupted
a
big
man
who
had
not
yet
spoken
and
whose
beard
was
as
black
as
his
mask
that
we
could
make
use
of
just
such
a
man
as
this
and
of
more
like
him
if
they
are
to
be
found
you
are
right
said
venier
if
he
will
take
the
oath
and
bear
the
tests
let
him
be
one
of
us
my
friend
he
said
to
zorzi
you
see
how
it
is
you
have
proved
yourself
a
brave
man
and
if
you
are
willing
to
join
our
company
we
shall
be
glad
to
receive
you
among
us
do
you
agree
i
must
know
what
the
purpose
of
your
society
is
answered
zorzi
as
calmly
as
before
that
is
well
said
my
friend
and
i
like
you
the
better
for
it
now
listen
to
me
we
are
a
brotherhood
of
gentlemen
of
venice
sworn
together
to
restore
the
original
freedom
of
our
city
that
is
our
main
purpose
what
tiepolo
and
faliero
failed
to
do
we
hope
to
accomplish
are
you
with
us
in
that
sirs
answered
zorzi
i
am
a
dalmatian
by
birth
and
not
a
venetian
the
republic
forbids
me
to
learn
the
art
of
i
have
learned
it
the
republic
forbids
me
to
set
up
a
furnace
of
my
own
i
hope
to
do
so
i
owe
venice
neither
allegiance
nor
gratitude
if
your
revolution
is
to
give
freedom
to
art
as
well
as
to
men
i
am
with
you
we
shall
have
freedom
for
all
said
venier
we
take
moreover
an
oath
of
fellowship
which
binds
us
to
help
each
other
in
all
circumstances
to
the
utmost
of
our
ability
and
fortune
within
the
bounds
of
reason
to
risk
life
and
limb
for
each
other
safety
and
most
especially
to
respect
the
wives
the
daughters
and
the
betrothed
brides
of
all
who
belong
to
our
fellowship
these
are
promises
which
every
true
and
honest
man
can
make
to
his
friends
and
we
agree
that
whoso
breaks
any
one
of
them
shall
die
by
the
hands
of
the
company
and
by
god
in
heaven
it
were
better
that
you
should
lose
your
life
now
before
taking
the
oath
than
that
you
should
be
false
to
it
i
will
take
that
oath
and
keep
it
said
zorzi
that
is
well
we
have
few
signs
and
no
ceremonies
but
our
promises
are
binding
and
the
forfeit
is
a
painful
death
so
painful
that
even
you
might
flinch
before
it
indeed
we
usually
make
some
test
of
a
courage
before
receiving
him
among
us
though
most
of
us
have
known
each
other
since
we
were
children
but
you
have
shown
us
that
you
are
fearless
and
honourable
and
we
ask
nothing
more
of
you
except
to
take
the
oath
and
then
to
keep
it
he
turned
to
the
company
still
speaking
in
his
languid
way
if
any
man
here
knows
good
reason
why
this
new
companion
should
not
be
one
of
us
let
him
show
it
now
then
all
were
silent
and
uncovered
their
heads
but
they
still
kept
their
masks
on
their
faces
zorzi
stood
out
before
them
and
venier
was
close
beside
him
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
said
venier
in
a
solemn
tone
quite
different
from
his
ordinary
voice
and
repeat
the
words
after
me
and
zorzi
repeated
them
steadily
and
precisely
holding
his
hand
stretched
out
before
him
in
the
name
of
the
holy
trinity
i
promise
and
swear
to
give
life
and
fortune
in
the
good
cause
of
restoring
the
original
liberty
of
the
people
of
venice
obeying
to
that
end
the
decisions
of
this
honourable
society
and
to
bear
all
sufferings
rather
than
betray
it
or
any
of
its
members
and
i
promise
to
help
each
one
of
my
companions
also
in
the
ordinary
affairs
of
life
to
the
best
of
my
ability
and
fortune
within
the
bounds
of
reason
risking
life
and
limb
for
the
safety
of
each
and
all
and
i
promise
most
especially
to
honour
and
respect
the
wives
the
daughters
and
the
betrothed
brides
of
all
who
belong
to
this
fellowship
and
to
defend
them
from
harm
and
insult
even
as
my
own
mother
and
if
i
break
any
promise
of
this
oath
may
my
flesh
be
torn
from
my
limbs
and
my
limbs
from
my
body
one
by
one
to
be
burned
with
fire
and
the
ashes
thereof
scattered
abroad
amen
when
zorzi
had
said
the
last
word
venier
grasped
his
hand
at
the
same
time
taking
off
the
mask
he
wore
and
he
looked
into
the
young
face
i
am
zuan
venier
he
said
his
indolent
manner
returning
as
he
spoke
i
am
jacopo
contarini
said
the
master
of
the
house
offering
his
hand
next
zorzi
looked
first
at
one
and
then
at
the
other
the
first
was
a
very
pale
young
man
with
bright
blue
eyes
and
delicate
features
that
were
prematurely
weary
and
even
worn
contarini
was
called
the
handsomest
venetian
of
his
day
yet
of
the
two
most
men
and
women
would
have
been
more
attracted
to
venier
at
first
sight
for
contarini
silken
beard
hardly
concealed
a
weak
and
feminine
mouth
with
lips
too
red
and
too
curving
for
a
man
and
his
soft
brown
eyes
had
an
unmanly
tendency
to
look
away
while
he
was
speaking
he
was
tall
broad
shouldered
and
well
proportioned
with
beautiful
hands
and
shapely
feet
yet
he
did
not
give
an
impression
of
strength
whereas
venier
languid
manner
assumed
as
it
doubtless
was
could
not
hide
the
restless
energy
that
lay
in
his
lean
frame
one
by
one
the
other
companions
came
up
to
zorzi
took
off
their
masks
and
grasped
his
hand
and
he
heard
their
lips
pronounce
names
famous
in
venetian
history
loredan
mocenigo
foscari
and
many
others
but
he
saw
that
not
one
of
them
all
was
over
years
of
age
and
with
the
keenness
of
the
waif
who
had
fought
his
own
way
in
the
world
he
judged
that
these
were
not
men
who
could
overturn
the
great
republic
and
build
up
a
new
government
whatever
they
might
prove
to
be
in
danger
and
revolution
however
he
had
saved
his
life
by
casting
his
lot
with
theirs
and
he
was
profoundly
grateful
to
them
for
having
accepted
him
as
one
of
themselves
but
for
their
generosity
his
weighted
body
would
have
been
already
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
canal
and
he
was
not
just
now
inclined
to
criticise
the
mental
gifts
of
those
conspirators
who
had
so
unexpectedly
forgiven
him
for
discovering
their
secret
meeting
sirs
he
said
when
he
had
grasped
the
hand
of
each
i
hope
that
in
return
for
my
life
for
which
i
thank
you
i
may
be
of
some
service
to
the
cause
of
liberty
and
to
each
of
you
in
singular
though
i
have
but
little
hope
of
this
seeing
that
i
am
but
an
artist
and
you
are
all
patricians
i
pray
you
inform
me
by
what
sign
i
may
know
you
if
we
chance
to
meet
outside
this
house
and
how
i
may
make
myself
known
we
have
little
need
of
signs
answered
contarini
for
we
meet
often
and
we
know
each
other
well
but
our
password
is
angel
meaning
the
angel
that
freed
saint
peter
from
his
bonds
as
we
hope
to
free
venice
from
hers
and
the
token
we
give
is
the
grip
of
the
hand
we
have
each
given
you
being
thus
instructed
zorzi
held
his
peace
for
he
felt
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
men
far
above
him
in
station
in
whose
conversation
it
would
not
be
easy
for
him
to
join
and
of
whose
daily
lives
he
knew
nothing
except
that
most
of
them
lived
in
palaces
and
many
were
the
sons
of
councillors
of
the
ten
and
of
senators
and
procurators
and
of
others
high
in
office
whereat
he
wondered
much
but
presently
as
the
excitement
of
what
had
happened
wore
off
and
they
sat
about
the
table
they
began
to
speak
of
the
news
of
the
day
and
especially
of
the
unjust
and
cruel
acts
of
the
ten
each
contributing
some
detail
learned
in
his
own
home
or
among
intimate
friends
zorzi
sat
silent
in
his
place
listening
and
he
soon
understood
that
as
yet
they
had
no
definite
plan
for
bringing
on
a
revolution
and
that
they
knew
nothing
of
the
populace
upon
whose
support
they
reckoned
and
of
whom
zorzi
knew
much
by
experience
yet
though
they
told
each
other
things
which
seemed
foolish
to
him
he
said
nothing
on
that
first
night
and
all
the
time
he
watched
contarini
very
closely
and
listened
with
especial
attention
to
what
he
said
trying
to
discern
his
character
and
judge
his
understanding
the
splendid
young
venetian
was
not
displeased
by
zorzi
attitude
towards
him
and
presently
came
and
sat
beside
him
i
should
have
explained
to
you
he
said
that
as
it
would
be
impossible
for
us
to
meet
here
without
the
knowledge
of
my
servants
we
come
together
on
pretence
of
playing
games
of
chance
my
father
lives
in
our
palace
near
saint
mark
and
i
live
here
alone
at
this
foscari
the
tall
man
with
the
black
beard
looked
at
contarini
and
laughed
a
little
contarini
glanced
at
him
and
smiled
with
some
constraint
on
such
evenings
he
continued
i
admit
my
guests
myself
and
they
wear
masks
when
they
come
for
though
my
servants
are
dismissed
to
their
quarters
and
would
certainly
not
betray
me
for
a
they
might
let
drop
the
names
of
my
friends
if
they
saw
them
from
an
upper
window
at
this
juncture
zorzi
heard
the
rattling
of
dice
and
looking
down
the
table
he
saw
that
two
of
the
company
were
already
throwing
against
each
other
in
a
few
minutes
he
found
himself
sitting
alone
near
zuan
venier
all
the
others
having
either
begun
to
play
themselves
or
being
engaged
in
wagering
on
the
play
of
others
and
you
sir
inquired
zorzi
of
his
neighbour
i
am
tired
of
games
of
chance
answered
the
pale
nobleman
wearily
but
our
host
says
it
is
a
mere
pretence
to
hide
the
purpose
of
these
meetings
it
is
more
than
that
said
venier
with
a
contemptuous
smile
do
you
play
i
am
a
poor
artist
sir
i
can
not
ah
i
had
forgotten
that
is
very
interesting
but
pray
do
not
call
me
nor
use
any
formality
unless
we
meet
in
public
at
the
of
the
angel
we
are
all
brothers
yes
yes
of
course
you
are
a
poor
artist
when
i
expected
to
be
obliged
to
cut
your
throat
awhile
ago
i
really
hoped
that
i
might
be
able
to
fulfil
some
last
wish
of
yours
i
appreciated
your
goodness
zorzi
laughed
a
little
nervously
now
that
the
danger
was
over
i
meant
it
my
friend
i
do
assure
you
and
i
mean
it
now
one
advantage
of
the
fellowship
is
that
one
may
offer
to
help
a
brother
in
any
way
without
insulting
him
i
am
not
as
rich
as
i
was
i
was
too
fond
of
those
things
once
he
pointed
to
the
dice
but
if
my
purse
can
serve
you
such
as
it
is
i
hope
you
will
use
it
rather
than
that
of
another
it
was
impossible
to
be
offended
sensitive
though
zorzi
was
i
thank
you
heartily
he
answered
it
would
be
a
curiosity
to
see
money
do
good
for
once
said
venier
languidly
looking
towards
the
players
contarini
is
losing
again
he
remarked
does
he
generally
lose
much
at
play
zorzi
asked
trying
to
seem
indifferent
venier
laughed
softly
it
is
proverbial
lose
like
jacopo
contarini
he
answered
tell
me
i
beg
of
you
are
all
the
meetings
of
the
brotherhood
like
this
one
in
what
way
asked
venier
indifferently
do
you
merely
tell
each
other
the
news
of
the
day
and
then
play
at
dice
all
night
some
play
cards
venier
laughed
scornfully
this
is
only
the
third
of
our
secret
sittings
i
believe
but
many
of
us
meet
elsewhere
during
the
day
our
host
said
that
the
society
made
a
pretence
of
play
in
order
to
conspire
against
the
state
said
zorzi
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
making
a
pretence
of
conspiracy
with
the
chance
of
death
on
the
scaffold
for
the
sake
of
to
tell
the
truth
i
think
so
too
answered
the
patrician
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
young
it
is
more
interesting
to
break
a
law
when
you
may
lose
your
head
for
it
than
if
you
only
risk
a
fine
or
a
year
banishment
i
daresay
that
seems
complicated
to
you
zorzi
laughed
if
it
is
only
for
the
sake
of
the
danger
he
said
why
not
go
and
fight
the
turks
i
have
tried
to
do
my
share
of
that
replied
venier
quietly
so
have
some
of
the
others
contarini
asked
zorzi
no
i
believe
he
has
never
seen
any
fighting
while
the
two
were
talking
the
play
had
proceeded
steadily
and
almost
in
silence
contarini
had
lost
heavily
at
first
and
had
then
won
back
his
losses
and
twice
as
much
more
that
does
not
happen
often
he
said
pushing
away
the
dice
and
leaning
back
zorzi
watched
him
the
yellow
light
of
the
wax
candles
fell
softly
upon
his
silky
beard
and
too
perfect
features
and
made
splendid
shadows
in
the
scarlet
silk
of
his
coat
and
flashed
in
the
precious
ruby
of
the
ring
he
wore
on
his
white
hand
he
seemed
a
true
incarnation
of
his
magnificent
city
a
century
before
the
rest
of
all
italy
in
luxury
in
extravagance
in
the
art
of
wasteful
trifling
with
great
things
which
is
a
rich
man
way
of
loving
art
itself
and
there
were
many
others
of
the
company
who
were
of
the
same
stamp
as
he
but
whose
faces
had
no
interest
for
zorzi
compared
with
contarini
beside
him
they
were
but
ordinary
men
in
the
presence
of
a
young
god
no
woman
could
resist
such
a
man
as
that
thought
the
poor
waif
it
would
be
enough
that
marietta
eyes
should
rest
on
him
one
moment
next
sunday
when
he
should
be
standing
by
the
great
pillar
in
the
church
and
her
fate
would
be
sealed
then
and
there
irrevocably
it
was
not
because
she
was
only
a
daughter
brought
up
in
murano
what
girl
who
was
human
would
hesitate
to
accept
such
a
husband
contarini
might
choose
his
wife
as
he
pleased
among
the
noblest
and
most
beautiful
in
italy
one
or
both
of
two
reasons
would
explain
why
his
choice
had
fallen
upon
marietta
it
was
possible
that
he
had
seen
her
and
zorzi
firmly
believed
that
no
man
could
see
her
without
loving
her
and
angelo
beroviero
might
have
offered
such
an
immense
dowry
for
the
alliance
as
to
tempt
jacopo
father
no
one
knew
how
rich
old
angelo
was
since
he
had
returned
from
florence
and
naples
and
many
said
that
he
possessed
the
secret
of
making
gold
but
zorzi
knew
better
than
that
chapter
iii
it
was
past
midnight
when
jacopo
contarini
barred
the
door
of
his
house
and
was
alone
he
took
one
of
the
candles
from
the
inner
room
put
out
all
the
others
and
was
already
in
the
hall
when
he
remembered
that
he
had
left
his
winnings
on
the
table
going
back
he
opened
the
embroidered
wallet
he
wore
at
his
belt
and
swept
the
heap
of
heavy
yellow
coins
into
it
as
the
last
disappeared
into
the
bag
and
rang
upon
the
others
he
distinctly
heard
a
sound
in
the
room
he
started
and
looked
about
him
it
was
not
exactly
the
sound
of
a
soft
footfall
nor
of
breathing
but
it
might
have
been
either
it
was
short
and
distinct
such
a
slight
noise
as
might
be
made
by
drawing
the
palm
of
the
hand
quickly
over
a
piece
of
stuff
or
by
a
short
breath
checked
almost
instantly
or
by
a
shoeless
foot
slipping
a
few
inches
on
a
thick
carpet
contarini
stood
still
and
listened
for
though
he
had
heard
it
distinctly
he
had
no
impression
of
the
direction
whence
it
had
come
it
was
not
repeated
and
he
began
to
search
the
room
carefully
he
could
find
nothing
the
single
window
high
above
the
floor
was
carefully
closed
and
covered
by
a
heavy
curtain
which
could
not
possibly
have
moved
in
the
stillness
the
tapestry
was
smoothly
drawn
and
fastened
upon
the
four
walls
there
was
no
furniture
in
the
room
but
a
big
table
and
the
benches
and
chairs
above
the
tapestries
the
bare
walls
were
painted
up
to
the
carved
ceiling
there
was
nothing
to
account
for
the
noise
contarini
looked
nervously
over
his
shoulder
as
he
left
the
room
and
more
than
once
again
as
he
went
up
the
marble
staircase
candle
in
hand
there
is
probably
nothing
more
disturbing
to
people
of
ordinary
nerves
than
a
sound
heard
in
a
lonely
place
and
for
which
it
is
impossible
to
find
a
reason
when
he
reached
the
broad
landing
he
smiled
at
himself
and
looked
back
a
last
time
shading
the
candle
with
his
hand
so
as
to
throw
the
light
down
the
staircase
then
he
entered
the
apartment
and
locked
himself
in
having
passed
through
the
large
square
vestibule
and
through
a
small
room
that
led
from
it
he
raised
the
latch
of
the
next
door
very
cautiously
shaded
the
candle
again
and
looked
in
a
cool
breeze
almost
put
out
the
light
i
am
not
asleep
said
a
sweet
young
voice
i
am
here
by
the
window
he
smiled
happily
at
the
words
the
fell
upon
a
face
as
he
went
forward
such
a
face
as
men
may
see
in
dreams
but
rarely
in
waking
life
half
sitting
half
lying
she
rested
in
eastern
fashion
among
the
silken
cushions
of
a
low
divan
the
open
windows
of
the
balcony
overlooked
the
low
houses
opposite
and
the
night
breeze
played
with
the
little
ringlets
of
her
glorious
hair
her
soft
eyes
looked
up
to
her
face
with
infinite
trustfulness
and
their
violet
depths
were
like
clear
crystal
and
as
tender
as
the
twilight
of
a
perfect
day
she
looked
at
him
her
head
thrown
back
one
ivory
arm
between
it
and
the
cushion
the
other
hand
stretched
out
to
welcome
his
her
mouth
was
like
a
southern
rose
when
there
is
dew
on
the
smooth
red
leaves
in
a
maze
of
creamy
shadows
the
fine
web
of
her
garment
followed
the
lines
of
her
resting
limbs
in
delicate
folds
and
one
small
white
foot
was
quite
uncovered
her
fan
of
ostrich
feathers
lay
idle
on
the
persian
carpet
come
my
beloved
she
said
i
have
waited
long
contarini
knelt
down
and
first
he
kissed
the
arching
instep
and
then
her
hand
that
felt
like
a
young
dove
just
stirring
under
his
touch
and
his
lips
caressed
the
satin
of
her
arm
and
at
last
with
a
fierce
little
choking
cry
they
found
her
own
that
waited
for
them
and
there
was
no
more
room
for
words
in
the
silence
of
the
june
night
one
kiss
answered
another
and
breath
mingled
with
breath
and
sigh
with
sigh
at
last
the
young
man
head
rested
against
her
shoulder
among
the
cushions
then
the
georgian
woman
opened
her
eyes
slowly
and
glanced
down
at
his
face
while
her
hand
stroked
and
smoothed
his
hair
and
he
could
not
see
the
strange
smile
on
her
wonderful
lips
for
she
knew
that
he
could
not
see
it
and
she
let
it
come
and
go
as
it
would
half
in
pity
and
half
in
scorn
i
knew
you
would
come
she
said
bending
her
head
a
little
nearer
to
his
when
i
do
not
you
will
know
that
i
am
dead
he
answered
almost
faintly
and
he
sighed
and
then
i
shall
go
to
you
she
said
but
as
she
spoke
she
smiled
again
to
herself
i
have
heard
that
in
old
times
when
the
lords
of
the
earth
died
their
most
favourite
slaves
were
killed
upon
the
funeral
pile
that
their
souls
might
wait
upon
their
master
in
the
world
beyond
yes
it
is
true
and
so
i
will
be
your
slave
there
as
i
am
here
and
the
night
that
lasts
for
ever
shall
seem
no
longer
than
this
summer
night
that
is
too
short
for
us
you
must
not
call
yourself
a
slave
arisa
answered
jacopo
what
am
i
then
you
bought
me
with
your
good
gold
from
aristarchi
the
greek
captain
in
the
slave
market
your
steward
has
the
receipt
for
the
money
among
his
accounts
and
there
is
the
greek
written
guarantee
too
i
am
sure
promising
to
take
me
back
and
return
the
money
if
i
was
not
all
he
told
you
i
was
those
are
my
documents
of
nobility
my
patents
of
rank
preserved
in
your
archives
with
your
own
she
spoke
playfully
smiling
to
herself
as
she
stroked
his
hair
but
he
caught
her
hand
tenderly
and
brought
it
to
his
lips
holding
it
there
you
are
more
free
than
i
he
said
which
of
us
two
is
the
slave
you
who
hold
me
or
i
who
am
held
this
little
hand
will
never
let
me
go
i
think
you
would
come
back
to
me
she
answered
but
if
i
ran
away
would
you
follow
me
you
will
not
run
away
he
spoke
quietly
and
confidently
still
holding
her
hand
as
if
he
were
talking
to
it
while
he
felt
the
breath
of
her
winds
upon
his
forehead
no
she
said
and
there
was
a
little
silence
i
have
but
one
fear
he
began
at
last
if
i
were
ruined
what
would
become
of
you
have
you
lost
at
play
again
she
asked
and
in
her
tone
there
was
a
note
of
anxiety
contarini
laughed
low
and
felt
for
the
wallet
at
his
aide
he
held
it
up
to
show
how
heavy
it
was
with
the
gold
and
made
her
take
it
she
only
kept
it
a
moment
but
while
it
was
in
her
hand
her
eyelids
were
half
closed
as
if
she
were
guessing
at
the
weight
for
he
could
not
see
her
face
i
won
all
that
he
said
you
shall
have
the
pearls
how
good
you
are
to
me
but
should
you
not
keep
the
money
you
may
need
it
why
do
you
talk
of
ruin
she
knew
that
he
would
give
her
all
he
had
she
almost
guessed
that
he
would
commit
a
crime
rather
than
lack
gold
to
give
her
you
do
not
know
my
father
he
answered
when
he
is
displeased
he
threatens
to
let
me
starve
he
will
cut
me
off
some
day
and
i
shall
have
to
turn
soldier
for
a
living
would
that
not
be
ruin
you
know
his
last
scheme
he
wishes
me
to
marry
the
daughter
of
a
rich
i
know
arisa
laughed
contemptuously
great
joy
may
your
bride
have
of
you
is
she
really
rich
yes
but
you
know
that
i
will
not
marry
her
why
not
asked
arisa
quite
simply
contarini
started
and
looked
up
at
her
face
in
the
dim
light
she
was
bending
down
to
him
with
a
very
loving
look
why
should
you
not
marry
she
asked
again
why
do
you
start
and
look
at
me
so
strangely
do
you
think
i
should
care
or
that
i
am
afraid
of
another
woman
for
you
yes
i
should
have
thought
that
you
would
be
jealous
he
still
gazed
at
her
in
astonishment
jealous
she
cried
and
as
she
laughed
she
shook
her
beautiful
head
and
the
gold
of
her
hair
glittered
in
the
flickering
jealous
i
look
at
me
is
she
younger
than
i
i
was
eighteen
years
old
the
other
day
if
she
is
younger
than
i
she
is
a
child
shall
i
be
jealous
of
children
is
she
taller
straighter
handsomer
than
i
am
show
her
to
me
and
i
will
laugh
in
her
face
can
she
sing
to
you
as
i
sing
in
the
summer
nights
the
songs
you
like
and
those
i
learned
by
the
kura
in
the
shadow
of
kasbek
is
her
hair
brighter
than
mine
is
her
hand
softer
is
her
step
lighter
jealous
not
i
will
your
rich
wife
be
your
slave
will
she
wake
for
you
sing
for
you
dance
for
you
rise
up
and
lie
down
at
your
bidding
work
for
you
live
for
you
die
for
you
as
i
will
will
she
love
you
as
i
can
love
caress
you
to
sleep
or
wake
you
with
kisses
at
your
dear
will
no
ah
no
there
is
no
woman
in
the
world
but
you
then
i
am
not
jealous
of
the
rest
least
of
all
of
your
young
bride
i
will
wager
with
myself
against
all
her
gold
for
your
life
and
i
shall
win
i
have
won
already
am
i
not
trying
to
persuade
you
that
you
should
marry
i
have
not
even
seen
her
her
father
sent
me
a
message
bidding
me
go
to
church
on
sunday
and
stand
beside
a
certain
pillar
to
see
and
be
seen
laughed
arisa
it
is
not
a
fair
exchange
she
will
look
at
the
handsomest
man
in
the
world
hush
that
is
the
truth
and
you
will
see
a
little
pale
girl
with
silly
blue
eyes
staring
at
you
her
wide
mouth
open
and
her
clumsy
hands
hanging
down
she
will
look
like
the
wooden
dolls
they
dress
in
the
latest
venetian
fashion
to
send
to
paris
every
year
that
the
french
courtiers
may
know
what
to
wear
and
her
father
will
hurry
her
along
for
fear
that
you
should
look
too
long
at
her
and
refuse
to
marry
such
a
thing
even
for
marco
polo
millions
contarini
laughed
carelessly
at
the
description
give
me
some
wine
he
said
we
will
drink
her
health
arisa
rose
with
the
grace
of
a
young
goddess
her
hair
tumbling
over
her
bare
shoulders
in
a
splendid
golden
confusion
contarini
watched
her
with
possessive
eyes
as
she
went
and
came
back
bringing
him
the
drink
she
brought
him
yellow
wine
of
chios
in
a
glass
calix
of
murano
blown
upon
a
slender
stem
and
just
touched
here
and
there
with
drops
of
tender
blue
a
health
to
the
bride
of
jacopo
contarini
she
said
with
a
ringing
little
laugh
then
she
set
the
wine
to
her
lips
so
that
they
were
wet
with
it
and
gave
him
the
glass
and
as
she
stooped
to
give
it
her
hair
fell
forward
and
almost
hid
her
from
him
a
health
to
the
shower
of
gold
he
said
and
he
drank
she
sat
down
beside
him
crossing
her
feet
like
an
eastern
woman
and
he
set
the
empty
glass
carelessly
upon
the
marble
floor
as
though
it
had
been
a
thing
of
no
price
that
glass
was
made
at
her
father
furnace
he
said
a
pity
he
could
not
have
made
his
daughter
of
glass
too
answered
arisa
graceful
and
silent
and
easily
destroyed
but
if
i
say
that
you
will
think
me
jealous
and
i
am
not
she
will
bring
you
wealth
i
wish
her
a
long
life
long
enough
to
understand
that
she
has
been
sold
to
you
for
your
good
name
like
a
slave
as
i
was
sold
but
that
you
gave
gold
for
me
because
you
wanted
me
for
myself
whereas
you
want
nothing
of
her
but
her
gold
but
for
that
contarini
seemed
to
be
hesitating
i
never
meant
to
marry
her
he
added
and
but
for
that
you
would
not
but
for
that
but
for
the
only
thing
which
i
have
not
to
give
you
i
wish
the
world
were
mine
with
all
the
rich
secret
things
in
it
the
myriads
of
millions
of
diamonds
in
the
earth
the
thousand
rivers
of
gold
that
lie
deep
in
the
mountain
rocks
and
all
mankind
and
all
that
mankind
has
from
end
to
end
of
it
then
you
should
have
it
all
for
your
own
and
you
would
not
need
to
marry
the
little
girl
with
the
fish
mouth
contarini
laughed
again
have
you
seen
her
that
you
can
describe
her
so
well
she
may
have
black
hair
who
knows
yes
perhaps
it
is
black
thin
and
coarse
like
the
hair
on
a
tail
and
she
has
black
eyes
like
ripe
olives
set
in
the
white
of
a
egg
and
she
has
a
dark
skin
like
spanish
leather
which
shines
when
she
is
hot
and
is
grey
when
she
is
cold
and
a
black
down
on
her
upper
lip
and
teeth
like
a
young
horse
i
hate
those
dark
women
but
you
have
never
seen
her
she
may
be
very
pretty
pretty
then
she
shall
be
as
you
choose
she
shall
have
a
round
face
round
eyes
a
round
nose
and
a
round
mouth
her
face
shall
be
pink
and
white
her
eyes
shall
be
of
blue
glass
and
her
hair
shall
be
as
smooth
and
yellow
as
fresh
butter
she
shall
have
little
fat
white
hands
like
a
healthy
baby
a
double
chin
and
a
short
waist
then
she
will
be
what
people
call
pretty
yes
assented
jacopo
that
is
very
amusing
but
just
suppose
for
the
sake
of
discussion
it
is
impossible
of
course
but
suppose
it
that
instead
of
there
being
only
one
perfectly
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
whose
name
is
arisa
there
should
be
two
and
that
the
name
of
the
other
chanced
to
be
marietta
beroviero
arisa
raised
her
eyes
and
gazed
steadily
at
jacopo
you
have
seen
her
she
said
in
a
tone
of
conviction
she
is
beautiful
no
i
give
you
my
word
that
i
have
not
seen
her
i
only
wanted
to
know
what
you
would
do
then
i
do
not
believe
that
any
woman
is
as
beautiful
as
i
am
answered
the
georgian
with
the
quiet
simplicity
of
a
savage
but
if
there
were
one
and
you
saw
her
insisted
the
man
to
see
what
she
would
say
we
could
not
both
live
one
of
us
would
kill
the
other
i
believe
you
would
said
jacopo
watching
her
face
she
had
forgotten
his
presence
while
she
spoke
a
fierce
hardness
had
come
into
her
eyes
and
her
upper
lip
was
a
little
raised
in
a
cruel
expression
just
showing
her
teeth
he
was
surprised
i
never
saw
you
like
that
he
said
you
should
not
make
me
think
of
killing
she
answered
suddenly
leaving
her
seat
and
kneeling
beside
him
on
the
divan
it
is
not
good
to
think
too
much
of
killing
it
makes
one
wish
to
do
it
then
try
and
kill
me
with
kisses
he
said
looking
into
her
eyes
that
were
growing
tender
again
you
would
not
know
you
were
dying
she
whispered
her
lips
quite
close
to
his
as
she
kissed
him
she
loosened
the
collar
from
his
white
throat
and
smoothed
his
thick
hair
back
from
his
forehead
upon
the
pillow
and
she
saw
how
pale
he
was
under
her
touch
but
by
and
by
he
fell
asleep
and
then
she
very
softly
drew
her
arm
from
beneath
his
tired
head
and
slipped
from
his
side
and
stood
up
with
a
little
sigh
of
relief
the
candle
had
burned
to
the
socket
she
blew
it
out
it
was
still
an
hour
before
dawn
when
she
left
the
room
lifting
the
heavy
curtain
that
hung
before
the
door
of
her
inner
chamber
there
a
faint
light
was
burning
before
a
shrine
in
a
silver
cup
filled
with
oil
as
she
fastened
the
door
noiselessly
behind
her
a
man
caught
her
in
his
arms
lifting
her
off
her
feet
like
a
child
shaggy
black
hair
grew
low
upon
his
bossy
forehead
his
dark
eyes
were
fierce
and
bloodshot
a
rough
beard
only
half
concealed
the
huge
jaw
and
iron
lips
he
was
half
clad
in
shirt
and
hose
and
the
muscles
of
his
neck
and
arms
stood
out
like
brown
ropes
as
he
pressed
the
beautiful
creature
to
his
broad
chest
i
thought
he
would
never
sleep
she
whispered
her
eyelids
drooped
and
her
cheeks
grew
deadly
white
and
the
strong
man
felt
the
furious
beating
of
her
heart
against
his
own
breast
he
was
aristarchi
the
greek
captain
who
had
sold
her
for
a
slave
and
she
loved
him
in
the
wild
days
of
among
the
greek
islands
he
had
taken
a
small
trading
galley
that
had
been
driven
out
of
her
course
he
left
not
a
man
of
her
crew
alive
to
tell
whether
she
had
been
turkish
or
christian
and
he
took
all
that
was
worth
taking
of
her
poor
cargo
the
only
prize
of
any
price
was
the
captive
georgian
girl
who
was
being
brought
westward
to
be
sold
like
thousands
of
others
in
those
days
with
little
concealment
and
no
mystery
in
one
of
the
slave
markets
of
northern
italy
aristarchi
claimed
her
for
himself
as
his
share
of
the
booty
but
his
men
knew
her
value
standing
shoulder
to
shoulder
between
him
and
her
they
drew
their
knives
and
threatened
to
cut
her
to
pieces
if
he
would
not
promise
to
sell
her
as
she
was
when
they
should
come
to
land
and
share
the
price
with
them
they
judged
that
she
must
be
worth
a
thousand
or
fifteen
hundred
pieces
of
gold
for
she
was
more
beautiful
than
any
woman
they
had
ever
seen
and
they
had
already
heard
her
singing
most
sweetly
to
herself
as
if
she
were
quite
sure
that
she
was
in
no
danger
because
she
knew
her
own
value
so
aristarchi
was
forced
to
consent
cursing
them
and
night
and
day
they
guarded
her
door
against
him
till
they
had
brought
her
safe
to
venice
and
delivered
her
to
the
then
aristarchi
sold
all
that
he
had
except
his
ship
and
it
all
brought
far
too
little
to
buy
such
a
slave
she
would
have
gone
with
him
for
she
had
seen
that
he
was
stronger
than
other
men
and
feared
neither
god
nor
man
but
she
was
well
guarded
and
he
was
only
allowed
to
talk
with
her
through
a
grated
window
like
those
at
convent
gates
she
was
not
long
in
the
dealers
house
for
word
was
brought
to
all
the
young
patricians
of
venice
and
many
of
them
bid
against
each
other
for
her
in
the
dealers
inner
room
till
contarini
outbid
them
all
saying
that
he
could
not
live
without
her
though
the
price
should
ruin
him
and
because
he
had
not
enough
gold
he
gave
the
dealers
besides
money
a
marvellous
sword
with
a
jewelled
hilt
which
one
of
his
forefathers
had
taken
at
the
siege
of
constantinople
and
which
some
said
had
belonged
to
the
emperor
justinian
himself
nine
hundred
years
ago
then
aristarchi
and
his
men
paid
the
dealers
their
commission
and
took
the
money
and
the
sword
but
before
he
went
from
the
house
the
greek
captain
begged
leave
to
see
arisa
once
more
at
the
grating
and
he
told
her
that
come
what
might
he
should
steal
her
away
she
bade
him
not
to
be
in
too
great
haste
and
she
promised
that
if
he
would
wait
he
should
have
with
her
more
gold
than
her
new
master
had
given
for
her
for
she
would
take
all
he
had
from
him
little
by
little
and
when
they
had
enough
they
would
leave
venice
secretly
and
live
in
a
grand
manner
in
florence
or
in
rome
or
in
sicily
for
she
never
doubted
but
that
he
would
find
some
way
of
coming
to
her
though
she
were
guarded
more
closely
than
in
the
house
where
the
windows
were
grated
and
armed
men
slept
before
the
door
and
one
of
the
dealers
watched
all
night
more
than
a
year
had
passed
since
then
the
strong
greek
knew
every
corner
of
the
house
of
the
agnus
dei
and
every
foothold
under
windows
from
the
water
to
the
stone
sill
by
which
he
could
help
himself
a
little
as
he
went
up
hand
over
hand
by
the
knotted
silk
rope
that
would
have
cut
to
the
bone
any
hands
but
his
she
kept
it
hidden
in
a
cushioned
footstool
in
her
inner
room
many
a
risk
he
had
run
and
more
than
once
in
winter
he
had
slipped
down
the
rope
with
haste
to
let
himself
gently
into
the
icy
water
and
he
had
swum
far
down
the
dark
canal
to
a
for
he
was
a
man
of
iron
so
it
came
about
that
jacopo
contarini
lived
in
a
fool
paradise
in
which
he
was
not
only
the
chief
fool
himself
but
was
moreover
in
bodily
danger
more
often
than
he
knew
for
though
aristarchi
had
hitherto
managed
to
escape
being
seen
he
would
have
killed
jacopo
with
his
naked
hands
if
the
latter
had
ever
caught
him
as
easily
as
a
boy
wrings
a
bird
neck
and
with
as
little
scruple
of
conscience
the
georgian
loved
him
for
his
hirsute
strength
for
his
fearlessness
even
his
violence
and
dangerous
temper
he
dominated
her
as
naturally
as
she
controlled
her
master
whose
vacillating
nature
and
love
of
idle
ease
filled
her
with
contempt
it
was
for
the
sake
of
gold
that
she
acted
her
part
daily
and
nightly
with
a
wisdom
and
unwavering
skill
that
were
almost
superhuman
and
the
greek
ruffian
agreed
to
the
bargain
and
had
been
in
no
haste
to
carry
her
off
as
he
might
have
done
at
any
time
she
hoarded
the
money
she
got
from
jacopo
to
give
it
by
stealth
to
aristarchi
who
hid
their
growing
wealth
in
a
safe
place
where
it
was
always
ready
but
she
kept
her
jewels
always
together
in
case
of
an
unexpected
flight
since
she
dared
not
sell
them
nor
give
them
to
the
greek
lest
they
should
be
missed
of
late
it
had
seemed
to
them
both
that
the
time
for
their
final
action
was
at
hand
for
it
had
been
clear
to
arisa
that
jacopo
was
near
the
end
of
his
resources
and
that
his
father
was
resolved
to
force
him
to
change
his
life
there
were
days
when
he
was
reduced
to
borrowing
money
for
his
actual
needs
and
though
an
occasional
stroke
of
good
fortune
at
play
temporarily
relieved
him
arisa
was
sure
that
he
was
constantly
sinking
deeper
into
debt
but
within
the
week
the
aspect
of
his
affairs
had
changed
the
marriage
with
marietta
had
been
proposed
and
arisa
had
made
a
discovery
she
told
aristarchi
everything
as
naturally
as
she
would
have
concealed
everything
from
contarini
we
shall
be
rich
she
said
twining
her
white
arms
round
his
swarthy
neck
and
looking
up
into
his
murderous
eyes
with
something
like
genuine
adoration
we
shall
get
the
wife
dowry
for
ourselves
by
degrees
every
farthing
of
it
and
it
shall
be
the
dower
of
aristarchi
bride
instead
i
shall
not
be
portionless
you
shall
not
be
ashamed
of
me
when
you
meet
your
old
friends
ashamed
his
arm
pressed
her
to
him
till
she
longed
to
cry
out
for
pain
yet
she
would
not
have
had
him
less
rough
you
are
so
strong
she
gasped
in
a
broken
whisper
yes
a
little
looser
so
i
can
speak
now
you
must
go
to
murano
and
find
out
all
about
this
angelo
beroviero
and
his
daughter
try
to
see
her
and
tell
me
whether
she
is
pretty
but
most
of
all
learn
whether
she
is
really
rich
that
is
easy
enough
i
will
go
to
the
furnace
and
offer
to
buy
a
cargo
of
glass
for
sicily
but
you
will
not
take
it
asked
arisa
in
sudden
anxiety
lest
he
should
leave
her
to
make
the
voyage
no
no
i
will
make
inquiries
i
will
ask
for
a
sort
of
glass
that
does
not
exist
yes
she
said
reassured
do
that
i
must
know
if
the
girl
is
rich
before
i
marry
him
to
her
but
can
you
make
him
marry
her
at
all
asked
aristarchi
i
can
make
him
do
anything
i
please
we
drank
to
the
health
of
the
bride
in
a
goblet
made
by
her
father
the
wine
was
strong
and
i
put
a
little
syrup
of
poppies
into
it
he
will
not
wake
for
hours
what
is
the
matter
she
felt
the
rough
man
shaking
beside
her
as
if
he
were
in
an
ague
i
was
laughing
he
said
when
he
could
speak
it
is
a
good
jest
but
is
there
no
danger
in
all
this
is
it
quite
impossible
that
he
should
take
a
liking
for
his
wife
and
leave
me
arisa
whisper
was
hot
with
indignation
at
the
mere
thought
then
i
suppose
you
would
leave
me
for
the
first
pretty
girl
with
a
fortune
who
wanted
to
marry
you
this
contarini
is
such
a
fool
answered
aristarchi
contemptuously
by
way
of
explanation
and
apology
arisa
was
instantly
pacified
if
he
should
be
foolish
enough
for
that
i
have
means
that
will
keep
him
she
answered
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
force
him
to
do
anything
except
by
his
passion
for
you
i
can
i
was
not
going
to
tell
you
yet
you
always
make
me
tell
you
everything
like
a
child
what
is
it
asked
the
greek
have
you
found
out
anything
new
about
him
of
course
you
must
tell
me
we
hold
his
life
in
our
hands
she
said
quietly
and
aristarchi
knew
that
she
was
not
exaggerating
the
truth
she
began
to
tell
him
how
this
was
the
third
time
that
a
number
of
masked
men
had
come
to
the
house
an
hour
after
dark
and
had
stayed
till
midnight
or
later
and
how
contarini
had
told
her
that
they
came
to
play
at
dice
where
they
were
safe
from
interruption
and
that
on
these
nights
the
servants
were
sent
to
their
quarters
at
sunset
on
pain
of
dismissal
if
jacopo
found
them
about
the
house
but
that
they
also
received
generous
presents
of
money
to
keep
them
silent
the
man
is
a
fool
said
aristarchi
again
he
puts
himself
in
their
power
he
is
much
more
completely
in
ours
answered
arisa
the
servants
believe
that
his
friends
come
to
play
dice
and
so
they
do
but
they
come
for
something
more
serious
aristarchi
moved
his
massive
head
suddenly
to
an
attitude
of
profound
attention
they
are
plotting
against
the
republic
whispered
arisa
i
can
hear
all
they
say
are
you
sure
i
tell
you
i
can
hear
every
word
i
can
almost
see
them
look
here
come
with
me
she
rose
and
he
followed
her
to
the
corner
of
the
room
where
the
small
silver
lamp
burned
steadily
before
an
image
of
saint
mark
and
above
a
heavy
the
foot
moves
she
said
and
she
was
already
on
her
knees
on
the
floor
pushing
the
step
it
slid
back
with
the
soft
sound
contarini
had
heard
before
he
came
upstairs
the
upper
part
of
the
woodwork
was
built
into
the
wall
they
meet
in
the
place
below
this
arisa
said
when
they
are
there
i
can
see
a
glimmer
of
light
i
can
not
get
my
head
in
it
is
too
narrow
but
i
hear
as
if
i
were
with
them
how
did
you
find
this
out
asked
aristarchi
on
the
floor
beside
her
and
reaching
down
into
the
dark
space
to
explore
it
with
his
hand
it
is
deep
he
continued
without
waiting
for
an
answer
there
may
be
some
passage
by
which
one
can
get
down
only
a
child
could
pass
you
see
how
narrow
it
is
but
one
can
hear
every
sound
they
said
enough
to
send
them
all
to
the
scaffold
better
they
than
we
if
we
ever
have
to
make
the
choice
said
the
greek
ominously
he
had
withdrawn
his
arm
and
was
planted
upon
his
hands
and
knees
his
shaggy
head
hanging
over
the
dark
aperture
he
was
like
some
rough
wild
beast
that
has
tracked
its
quarry
to
earth
and
crouches
before
the
hole
waiting
for
a
victim
how
did
you
find
this
out
he
asked
again
looking
up
she
was
standing
by
the
corner
of
the
stool
now
all
her
marvellous
beauty
showing
in
the
light
of
the
little
lamp
and
against
the
wall
behind
her
i
was
saying
my
prayers
here
the
first
night
they
met
she
said
as
if
it
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
i
heard
voices
as
it
seemed
under
my
feet
i
tried
to
push
away
the
stool
and
the
foot
moved
that
is
all
aristarchi
jaw
dropped
a
little
as
he
looked
up
at
her
do
you
say
prayers
every
night
he
asked
in
wonder
of
course
i
do
do
you
never
say
a
prayer
no
he
was
still
staring
at
her
that
is
very
wrong
she
said
in
the
earnest
tone
a
mother
might
use
to
her
little
child
some
harm
will
befall
us
if
you
do
not
say
your
prayers
a
slow
smile
crossed
the
ruffian
face
as
he
realised
that
this
evil
woman
who
was
ready
to
commit
the
most
atrocious
deeds
out
of
love
for
him
was
still
half
a
child
chapter
iv
marietta
awoke
before
sunrise
with
a
smile
on
her
lips
and
as
she
opened
her
eyes
the
world
seemed
suddenly
gladder
than
ever
before
and
her
heart
beat
in
time
with
it
she
threw
back
the
shutters
wide
to
let
in
the
june
morning
as
if
it
were
a
beautiful
living
thing
and
it
breathed
upon
her
face
and
caressed
her
and
took
her
in
its
spirit
arms
and
filled
her
with
itself
not
a
sound
broke
the
stillness
as
she
looked
out
and
the
glassy
waters
of
the
canal
reflected
delicate
tints
from
the
sky
palest
green
and
faintest
violet
and
amber
with
all
the
lovely
changing
colours
of
the
dawn
by
the
footway
a
black
barge
was
moored
piled
high
with
round
uncovered
baskets
of
beads
white
blue
deep
red
and
black
waiting
to
be
taken
over
to
venice
where
they
would
be
threaded
for
the
east
and
the
colours
stood
out
in
strong
contrast
with
the
grey
stones
the
faint
reflections
in
the
water
and
the
tender
sky
above
there
were
flowers
on
the
a
young
rose
with
opening
buds
growing
in
a
red
earthen
jar
and
a
pot
of
lavender
just
bursting
into
flower
with
a
sweet
geranium
beside
it
and
some
rosemary
zorzi
had
planted
them
all
for
her
and
her
had
helped
her
to
fasten
the
pots
in
the
window
because
it
would
have
been
out
of
the
question
that
any
man
except
her
father
should
enter
her
room
even
when
she
was
not
there
but
they
were
zorzi
flowers
and
she
bent
down
and
smelt
their
fragrance
on
a
table
behind
her
a
single
rose
hung
over
the
edge
of
a
tall
glass
with
a
slender
stem
almost
the
counterpart
of
the
one
in
which
contarini
had
drunk
her
health
at
midnight
her
father
had
given
it
to
her
as
it
came
from
the
annealing
oven
still
warm
after
long
hours
of
cooling
with
many
others
like
it
she
loved
it
for
its
grace
and
lightness
and
as
for
the
rose
it
was
the
one
she
had
made
zorzi
give
back
to
her
yesterday
she
meant
to
keep
it
in
water
till
it
faded
and
then
she
would
press
it
between
the
first
page
and
the
binding
of
her
parchment
missal
it
would
keep
some
of
its
faint
scent
perhaps
and
if
any
one
saw
it
no
one
would
ever
guess
whence
it
came
it
meant
a
great
thing
to
her
for
it
had
told
her
zorzi
secret
which
he
had
kept
so
well
he
should
know
hers
some
day
but
not
yet
and
her
drooping
lids
could
hide
it
if
it
ever
came
into
her
eyes
it
was
too
soon
to
let
him
know
that
she
loved
him
that
was
one
reason
for
hiding
it
but
she
had
another
if
her
father
guessed
that
she
loved
the
waif
it
would
fare
ill
with
him
she
fancied
she
could
see
the
old
fiery
brown
eyes
and
hear
his
angry
voice
poor
zorzi
would
be
driven
from
murano
and
venice
never
to
set
foot
again
within
the
boundaries
of
the
republic
for
beroviero
was
a
man
of
weight
and
influence
of
whom
venice
was
proud
youth
would
be
very
sad
if
it
counted
time
and
labour
as
it
is
reckoned
and
valued
by
mature
age
some
day
zorzi
would
be
no
longer
a
mere
paid
helper
calling
himself
a
servant
when
his
humour
was
bitter
tending
a
fire
on
his
knees
and
grinding
coloured
earths
and
salts
in
a
mortar
he
had
the
understanding
of
the
glorious
art
and
the
true
love
of
it
with
the
magic
touch
he
would
make
a
name
for
himself
in
spite
of
the
harsh
venetian
law
and
some
day
his
master
would
be
proud
to
call
him
son
there
would
not
be
many
months
to
wait
months
or
years
what
mattered
since
she
loved
him
and
was
at
last
quite
sure
that
he
loved
her
that
was
enough
she
would
go
over
to
the
and
sit
in
the
garden
by
the
rose
he
had
planted
and
now
and
then
she
would
go
into
the
close
furnace
room
where
he
worked
with
her
father
or
zorzi
would
come
out
for
something
she
should
be
near
him
she
should
see
his
face
and
hear
his
quiet
voice
and
she
would
say
to
herself
he
loves
me
he
loves
me
as
often
as
she
chose
knowing
that
it
was
true
since
she
knew
it
she
was
sure
that
she
should
see
it
in
his
face
that
had
hidden
it
from
her
so
long
there
would
be
glances
when
he
thought
she
was
not
watching
him
his
colour
would
come
and
go
as
yesterday
and
he
would
do
her
some
little
service
now
and
then
in
which
the
sweet
truth
against
his
will
should
tell
itself
to
her
again
and
again
it
would
be
a
delicious
and
day
each
minute
a
pearl
each
hour
a
chaplet
of
jewels
from
golden
sunrise
to
golden
sunset
all
perfect
through
and
through
there
were
so
many
little
things
she
could
watch
in
him
now
that
she
knew
the
truth
things
that
had
long
meant
nothing
and
would
mean
volumes
she
would
watch
him
and
then
call
him
suddenly
and
see
him
try
to
hide
the
little
gladness
he
would
feel
as
he
turned
to
her
and
when
they
were
alone
a
moment
she
would
ask
him
whether
he
had
remembered
to
forget
jacopo
contarini
name
and
some
day
but
not
for
a
long
time
yet
she
would
drop
a
rose
again
and
she
would
turn
as
he
picked
it
up
but
she
would
not
make
him
give
it
back
to
her
and
in
that
way
he
should
know
that
she
loved
him
she
must
not
think
of
that
for
it
was
too
soon
yet
she
could
almost
see
his
face
as
it
would
be
when
he
knew
yesterday
her
father
had
talked
again
of
her
marriage
a
whole
month
had
passed
since
he
had
even
alluded
to
it
but
this
time
he
had
spoken
of
it
as
a
certainty
and
she
had
opened
her
eyes
wide
in
surprise
she
did
not
believe
that
it
was
to
be
how
could
she
marry
a
man
she
did
not
love
how
could
she
love
any
man
but
zorzi
they
might
show
her
twenty
venetian
patricians
that
she
might
choose
among
them
meanwhile
she
would
show
her
indifference
nothing
was
easier
than
to
put
on
an
inscrutable
expression
which
betrayed
nothing
but
which
as
she
knew
sometimes
irritated
her
father
beyond
endurance
he
had
always
promised
that
she
should
not
be
married
against
her
will
as
many
girls
were
then
why
should
she
marry
contarini
any
more
than
any
other
man
except
the
one
she
had
chosen
she
need
only
say
that
contarini
did
not
please
her
and
her
father
would
certainly
not
try
to
use
force
there
was
therefore
nothing
to
fear
and
since
her
first
surprise
was
over
she
felt
sure
of
appearing
quite
indifferent
she
would
put
the
thought
out
of
her
mind
and
begin
the
day
with
the
perfect
certainty
that
the
marriage
was
altogether
impossible
she
looked
out
over
her
flowers
the
door
of
the
was
open
now
and
the
burly
porter
was
sweeping
she
could
hear
the
cypress
broom
on
the
flagstones
inside
and
presently
it
appeared
in
sight
while
the
porter
was
still
invisible
and
it
whisked
out
a
mixture
of
black
dust
and
bread
crumbs
and
bits
of
green
salad
leaves
and
the
old
man
came
out
and
swept
everything
across
the
footway
into
the
canal
as
he
turned
to
go
back
the
workmen
came
trooping
across
the
bridge
to
the
furnaces
pale
men
with
intent
faces
very
different
from
ordinary
working
people
for
each
called
himself
an
artist
and
was
one
and
each
knew
that
so
far
as
the
law
was
concerned
the
proudest
noble
in
venice
could
marry
his
daughter
without
the
least
derogation
from
patrician
dignity
the
workmen
differed
from
her
own
father
not
in
station
but
only
in
the
degree
of
their
prosperity
if
zorzi
could
ever
have
been
one
of
them
the
rest
would
have
been
simple
enough
but
he
could
not
any
more
than
a
black
man
could
turn
white
at
will
there
was
no
evasion
of
law
by
which
a
man
not
born
a
venetian
could
ever
be
a
or
could
ever
acquire
the
privileges
possessed
from
birth
by
one
of
those
shabby
pale
young
men
who
were
crowding
past
the
porter
to
go
to
their
hard
day
work
yet
dexterous
as
they
were
there
was
not
one
that
had
his
skill
there
was
not
one
that
could
compare
with
him
as
an
artist
as
a
workman
as
a
man
no
indian
caste
no
ancient
nobility
no
mystic
priesthood
ever
set
up
a
barrier
so
impassable
between
itself
and
the
outer
world
as
that
which
defended
the
of
murano
for
centuries
against
all
who
wished
to
be
initiated
even
the
boys
who
fed
the
fires
all
night
were
of
the
calling
and
by
and
by
would
become
workmen
and
perhaps
masters
legally
almost
the
equals
of
the
splendid
nobles
who
sat
in
the
grand
council
over
there
in
venice
zorzi
very
existence
was
an
anomaly
he
had
no
social
right
to
be
what
he
was
and
he
knew
it
when
he
called
himself
a
servant
for
the
cruel
law
would
not
allow
him
to
be
anything
else
so
long
as
he
helped
angelo
beroviero
suddenly
while
marietta
watched
the
men
zorzi
was
there
among
them
coming
out
as
they
went
in
he
must
have
risen
early
she
thought
for
she
did
not
know
that
he
had
slept
in
the
laboratory
he
looked
pale
and
thin
as
he
flattened
himself
against
the
to
let
a
workman
pass
and
then
slipped
out
himself
no
one
greeted
him
even
by
a
nod
marietta
knew
that
they
hated
him
because
he
was
in
her
confidence
and
somehow
instead
of
pitying
him
she
was
glad
it
seemed
natural
that
he
should
not
be
one
of
them
that
he
should
pass
them
with
quiet
indifference
and
that
they
should
feel
for
him
the
instinctive
dislike
which
most
inferiors
feel
for
those
above
them
doubtless
they
looked
down
upon
him
or
told
themselves
that
they
did
but
in
their
hearts
they
knew
that
a
man
with
such
a
face
was
born
to
be
their
teacher
and
their
master
and
the
girl
was
proud
of
him
he
treated
them
with
more
civility
than
they
bestowed
on
him
but
it
was
the
courtesy
of
a
superior
who
would
not
assert
himself
who
would
scorn
to
thrust
himself
forward
or
in
any
way
to
claim
what
was
his
by
right
if
it
were
not
freely
offered
marietta
drew
back
a
little
so
that
she
could
just
see
him
between
the
flowers
without
being
seen
he
stood
still
looking
down
at
the
canal
till
the
last
of
the
men
had
passed
in
then
before
he
went
on
he
raised
his
eyes
slowly
to
marietta
window
not
guessing
that
her
own
were
answering
his
from
behind
the
rosemary
and
the
geranium
his
pale
face
was
very
sad
and
thoughtful
as
he
looked
up
she
had
never
seen
him
look
so
tired
the
porter
had
shut
the
door
which
he
never
allowed
to
remain
open
one
moment
longer
than
was
absolutely
necessary
and
zorzi
stood
quite
alone
on
the
footway
as
he
looked
his
face
softened
and
grew
so
tender
that
the
girl
who
watched
him
unseen
stretched
out
her
arms
towards
him
with
unconscious
yearning
and
her
heart
beat
very
fast
so
that
she
felt
the
pulses
in
her
throat
almost
choking
her
yet
her
face
was
pale
and
her
soft
lips
were
dry
and
cold
for
it
was
not
all
happiness
that
she
felt
there
was
a
sweet
mysterious
pain
with
it
which
was
nowhere
and
yet
all
through
her
that
was
weakness
and
yet
might
turn
to
strength
a
hunger
of
longing
for
something
dear
and
unknown
and
divine
without
which
all
else
was
an
empty
shadow
then
her
eyes
opened
to
him
as
he
had
never
seen
them
blue
as
the
depth
of
sapphires
and
dewy
with
love
mists
of
youth
early
spring
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
stand
there
just
beyond
the
narrow
water
and
not
feel
that
she
saw
him
and
loved
him
and
that
her
heart
was
crying
out
the
true
words
he
never
hoped
to
hear
but
he
did
not
know
and
all
at
once
his
eyes
fell
and
she
could
almost
see
that
he
sighed
as
he
turned
wearily
away
and
walked
with
bent
head
towards
the
wooden
bridge
she
would
have
given
anything
to
look
out
and
see
him
cross
and
come
nearer
but
she
remembered
that
she
was
not
yet
dressed
and
she
blushed
as
she
drew
further
back
into
the
room
gathering
the
thin
white
linen
up
to
her
throat
and
frightened
at
the
mere
thought
that
he
should
catch
sight
of
her
she
would
not
call
her
yet
she
would
be
alone
a
little
while
longer
she
threw
back
her
russet
hair
and
bent
down
to
smell
the
rose
in
the
tall
glass
the
sun
was
risen
now
and
the
first
slanting
beams
shot
sideways
through
her
window
from
the
right
the
day
that
was
to
be
so
sweet
had
begun
most
sweetly
she
had
seen
him
already
far
earlier
than
usual
she
would
see
him
many
times
before
the
little
brown
maid
crossed
the
canal
to
bring
her
home
in
the
evening
the
thought
put
an
end
to
her
meditations
and
she
was
suddenly
in
haste
to
be
dressed
to
be
out
of
the
house
to
be
sitting
in
the
little
garden
of
the
where
zorzi
must
soon
pass
again
she
called
and
clapped
her
hands
and
her
entered
from
the
outer
room
in
which
she
slept
she
brought
a
great
painted
earthenware
dish
on
which
fruit
was
arranged
half
of
a
small
yellow
melon
fresh
from
the
cool
storeroom
a
little
heap
of
dark
red
cherries
and
a
handful
of
ripe
plums
there
was
white
wheaten
bread
too
and
honey
from
aquileia
in
a
little
glass
jar
and
there
was
a
goblet
of
cold
water
the
maid
set
the
big
dish
on
the
table
beside
the
glass
that
held
zorzi
rose
and
began
to
make
ready
her
mistress
clothes
marietta
tasted
the
melon
and
it
was
cool
and
aromatic
and
she
stood
eating
a
slice
of
it
just
where
she
could
look
through
the
flowers
on
the
at
the
door
of
the
so
that
if
zorzi
passed
again
she
should
see
him
he
did
not
come
and
she
was
a
little
disappointed
but
the
melon
was
very
good
and
afterwards
she
ate
a
few
cherries
and
spread
a
spoonful
of
honey
on
a
piece
of
bread
and
nibbled
at
it
and
she
drank
some
of
the
water
looking
out
of
the
window
over
the
glass
was
it
always
so
beautiful
she
asked
speaking
to
herself
in
a
sort
of
wonder
at
what
she
felt
as
she
set
the
glass
upon
the
table
nella
the
maid
turned
quickly
to
her
with
a
look
of
inquiry
what
she
asked
what
is
beautiful
the
weather
it
is
summer
of
course
it
is
fine
did
you
expect
the
north
wind
or
rain
from
the
southwest
marietta
laughed
sweet
and
low
the
little
maid
always
amused
her
there
was
something
cheerful
in
the
queer
little
scolding
sentences
spoken
with
a
rising
inflection
on
almost
every
word
musical
and
yet
always
seeming
to
protest
gently
against
anything
marietta
said
i
know
of
something
much
more
beautiful
than
the
weather
nella
added
seeing
that
she
got
no
answer
except
a
laugh
do
you
wish
to
know
what
is
more
beautiful
than
a
summer
day
oh
i
know
the
answer
to
that
cried
marietta
you
used
to
catch
me
in
that
way
when
i
was
a
small
girl
well
my
little
lady
what
is
the
answer
i
have
said
nothing
what
is
more
beautiful
than
a
summer
day
why
two
summer
days
of
course
i
was
always
dreadfully
disappointed
when
you
gave
me
that
answer
for
i
expected
something
wonderful
nella
shook
her
head
as
she
unfolded
the
fine
linen
things
and
uttered
a
sort
of
little
clucking
sound
meant
to
show
her
disapproval
of
such
childish
jests
tut
tut
tut
we
are
grown
up
now
are
we
children
no
we
are
a
young
lady
beautiful
and
serious
tut
tut
tut
that
you
should
remember
the
nonsense
i
used
to
talk
to
make
you
stop
crying
for
your
mother
blessed
soul
and
i
myself
was
so
full
of
tears
that
a
drop
of
water
would
have
drowned
me
but
all
passes
praise
be
to
god
i
hope
not
said
marietta
but
so
low
that
the
woman
did
not
hear
i
will
ask
you
a
riddle
continued
nella
presently
oh
no
laughed
marietta
i
could
no
more
guess
a
riddle
than
i
could
give
a
dissertation
on
theology
riddles
are
for
rainy
days
in
winter
when
we
sit
by
the
fire
in
the
evening
wishing
it
were
morning
again
i
know
the
great
riddle
at
last
i
have
found
it
out
it
is
the
most
beautiful
thing
in
the
world
then
it
is
true
observed
nella
looking
at
her
with
satisfaction
what
asked
the
young
girl
carelessly
that
you
are
to
be
married
i
hope
so
answered
marietta
some
day
but
there
is
time
yet
perhaps
a
very
long
time
as
long
as
it
will
take
to
make
a
wedding
gown
embroidered
with
gold
and
pearls
not
a
day
longer
than
that
nella
looked
very
wise
and
watched
her
mistress
face
what
do
you
mean
the
master
has
ordered
just
such
a
gown
that
is
what
i
mean
do
you
think
i
would
talk
of
such
a
beautiful
thing
just
to
make
you
unhappy
if
you
were
not
to
have
one
but
you
will
not
forget
poor
nella
my
little
lady
you
will
take
me
with
you
to
venice
then
you
think
i
am
to
marry
some
one
from
the
city
what
is
his
name
the
master
knows
that
is
enough
but
it
must
be
the
doge
son
or
at
least
the
son
of
the
admiral
of
venice
it
will
take
two
months
to
embroider
the
gown
that
means
that
you
are
to
be
married
in
august
of
course
do
you
think
so
asked
marietta
indifferently
i
know
it
and
nella
gave
a
discontented
little
snort
for
she
did
not
like
to
have
her
conclusions
questioned
am
i
am
i
in
my
dotage
am
i
an
imbecile
the
gown
is
ordered
and
that
is
the
truth
do
you
think
the
master
has
ordered
a
wedding
gown
embroidered
with
gold
and
pearls
for
himself
marietta
tossed
her
hair
back
and
shook
it
down
her
shoulders
laughing
gaily
at
the
idea
ah
cried
nella
indignantly
now
you
are
mocking
me
you
are
making
a
of
your
poor
nella
it
is
too
bad
but
you
will
be
sorry
that
you
laughed
at
me
when
i
am
not
here
to
bring
you
melons
and
cherries
and
tell
you
the
news
in
the
morning
you
will
say
nella
she
was
not
such
an
ignorant
person
after
all
that
is
what
you
will
say
i
tell
you
that
if
your
father
orders
a
wedding
gown
you
are
the
only
person
in
the
house
who
can
wear
it
and
he
would
not
order
it
just
to
see
how
beautiful
you
would
be
as
a
bride
he
is
a
serious
man
the
master
he
is
grave
he
is
wise
he
does
nothing
without
much
reflection
and
what
he
does
is
well
done
he
says
daughter
is
to
be
married
therefore
i
will
order
a
splendid
dress
for
her
that
is
what
he
says
and
he
orders
it
that
has
an
air
of
reason
said
marietta
gravely
i
did
not
mean
to
laugh
at
you
oh
very
well
if
you
thought
your
father
unreasonable
what
should
i
say
he
does
not
say
one
thing
and
do
another
your
father
and
i
will
tell
you
something
they
will
make
the
gown
even
handsomer
than
he
ordered
it
because
he
is
very
rich
and
he
will
grumble
and
scold
but
in
the
end
he
will
pay
for
the
honour
of
the
house
then
you
will
wear
the
gown
and
all
venice
will
see
you
in
it
on
your
wedding
day
that
will
be
a
great
thing
for
the
venetians
observed
the
young
girl
trying
not
to
smile
they
will
see
that
there
are
rich
men
in
murano
too
it
will
be
a
lesson
for
their
intolerable
vanity
are
the
venetians
so
very
vain
well
was
not
my
husband
a
venetian
blessed
soul
it
seems
to
me
that
i
should
know
have
i
forgotten
how
he
would
fasten
a
cock
feather
in
his
cap
almost
like
a
gentleman
and
hang
his
cloak
over
one
shoulder
and
pull
up
his
hose
till
they
almost
cracked
so
as
to
show
off
his
leg
ah
he
had
handsome
legs
my
poor
vito
and
he
never
would
use
anything
but
pure
beeswax
to
stiffen
his
mustaches
no
he
never
would
use
tallow
he
was
almost
like
a
gentleman
nella
little
brown
eyes
were
moist
as
she
recalled
her
husband
small
vanities
his
dislike
of
tallow
as
a
cosmetic
seemed
to
affect
her
particularly
that
is
why
i
say
that
it
will
be
a
lesson
to
the
pride
of
those
venetians
to
see
your
marriage
she
resumed
after
drying
her
eyes
with
the
back
of
her
hand
and
the
people
of
murano
will
be
there
and
all
the
in
their
guild
since
the
master
is
the
head
of
it
i
suppose
zorzi
will
manage
to
be
there
too
nella
spoke
the
last
words
in
a
tone
of
disapproval
why
should
zorzi
not
be
at
my
wedding
asked
marietta
carelessly
why
should
he
asked
the
with
unusual
bluntness
but
i
daresay
the
master
will
find
something
for
him
to
do
he
is
clever
enough
at
doing
anything
yes
he
is
clever
assented
the
young
girl
why
do
you
not
like
him
give
me
some
more
water
you
are
always
afraid
that
i
shall
use
too
much
i
have
a
conscience
grumbled
nella
the
water
is
brought
from
far
it
is
paid
for
it
costs
money
we
must
not
use
too
much
of
it
every
day
the
boats
come
with
it
and
the
row
of
earthen
jars
in
the
court
is
filled
and
your
father
pays
he
always
pays
and
pays
and
pays
till
i
wonder
where
the
money
all
comes
from
they
say
he
makes
gold
over
there
in
the
furnace
he
makes
glass
answered
marietta
and
if
he
orders
gowns
for
me
with
pearls
and
gold
he
will
not
grudge
me
a
jug
of
water
why
do
you
dislike
zorzi
he
is
as
proud
as
a
marble
lion
and
as
obstinate
as
a
lombardy
mule
explained
nella
with
fine
imagery
if
that
is
not
enough
to
make
one
dislike
a
young
man
you
shall
tell
me
so
but
one
of
those
days
he
will
fall
there
is
trouble
for
the
proud
how
does
his
great
pride
show
itself
asked
marietta
i
have
not
noticed
it
that
would
indeed
be
the
end
of
everything
if
he
showed
his
pride
to
you
nella
was
much
displeased
by
the
mere
suggestion
but
with
us
it
is
different
he
never
speaks
to
the
other
workmen
they
never
speak
to
him
and
quite
right
too
since
he
holds
his
head
so
high
with
no
reason
at
all
but
it
will
not
last
for
ever
i
wonder
what
the
master
would
think
for
instance
if
he
knew
that
zorzi
takes
the
skiff
in
the
evening
and
rows
himself
over
to
venice
all
alone
and
comes
back
long
after
midnight
and
sleeps
in
the
across
the
way
because
he
can
not
get
into
the
house
zorzi
zorzi
the
master
can
not
move
without
zorzi
and
where
is
zorzi
at
night
at
home
and
in
bed
like
a
decent
young
man
no
zorzi
is
away
in
venice
heaven
knows
where
doing
heaven
knows
what
do
you
wonder
that
he
is
so
pale
and
tired
in
the
morning
it
seems
to
me
quite
natural
eh
what
do
you
think
my
pretty
lady
marietta
was
silent
for
a
moment
it
was
only
a
servant
spiteful
gossip
but
it
hurt
her
are
you
sure
that
he
goes
to
venice
alone
at
night
she
asked
after
a
little
pause
am
i
sure
that
i
live
that
i
belong
to
you
and
that
my
name
is
nella
is
not
the
boat
moored
under
my
window
did
i
not
hear
the
chain
rattling
softly
last
night
i
got
up
and
looked
out
and
i
saw
zorzi
as
i
see
you
taking
the
padlock
off
i
am
not
blind
praise
be
to
heaven
i
see
he
turned
the
boat
to
the
left
so
he
must
have
been
going
to
venice
and
it
was
at
least
an
hour
after
the
midnight
bells
when
i
heard
the
chain
again
and
i
looked
out
and
there
he
was
but
he
did
not
come
into
the
house
and
this
morning
i
saw
him
coming
out
of
the
just
as
the
men
went
in
he
was
as
pale
as
a
boiled
chicken
marietta
had
seen
him
too
and
the
coincidence
gave
colour
to
the
rest
of
the
woman
tale
as
would
have
happened
if
the
whole
story
had
been
an
invention
instead
of
being
quite
true
nella
was
combing
the
thick
hair
an
operation
peculiarly
conducive
to
a
maid
chattering
for
she
has
the
certainty
that
her
mistress
can
not
get
away
and
must
therefore
listen
patiently
a
shadow
had
fallen
on
the
brightness
of
marietta
morning
she
was
paler
too
but
she
said
nothing
of
course
he
was
tired
continued
nella
did
you
suppose
that
he
would
come
back
with
pink
cheeks
and
bright
eyes
like
a
baby
from
baptism
after
being
out
half
the
night
he
is
always
pale
said
marietta
because
he
goes
to
venice
every
night
retorted
nella
viciously
that
is
the
good
reason
oh
i
am
sure
of
it
and
besides
i
shall
watch
him
now
that
i
know
i
shall
see
him
whenever
he
takes
the
boat
it
is
none
of
your
business
where
he
goes
answered
marietta
it
does
not
concern
any
one
but
himself
oh
indeed
sneered
nella
then
the
honour
of
the
house
does
not
matter
it
is
no
concern
of
ours
and
your
father
need
never
know
that
his
trusty
servant
his
clever
assistant
his
faithful
confidant
who
shares
all
his
secrets
is
a
fellow
who
spends
his
nights
in
gambling
or
drinking
or
perhaps
in
making
love
to
some
venetian
girl
as
honourable
and
well
behaved
as
himself
marietta
had
grown
steadily
more
angry
while
nella
was
talking
she
had
her
father
temper
though
she
could
control
it
better
than
he
i
will
find
out
whether
this
story
is
true
she
said
coldly
if
it
is
not
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
you
shall
not
serve
me
any
longer
unless
you
can
be
more
careful
in
what
you
say
nella
jaw
dropped
and
her
hands
stood
still
and
trembled
the
one
holding
the
comb
upraised
the
other
gathering
a
quantity
of
her
mistress
hair
marietta
had
never
spoken
to
her
like
this
in
her
life
send
me
away
faltered
the
woman
in
utter
amazement
send
me
away
she
repeated
still
quite
dazed
but
it
is
impossible
her
voice
began
to
break
as
if
some
one
were
shaking
her
violently
by
the
shoulders
oh
no
no
you
the
sound
grew
more
piercing
as
she
went
on
and
the
words
were
soon
lost
as
she
broke
into
a
violent
fit
of
hysterical
crying
marietta
anger
subsided
as
her
pity
for
the
poor
creature
increased
she
had
made
a
great
effort
to
speak
quietly
and
not
to
say
more
than
she
meant
and
she
had
certainly
not
expected
to
produce
such
a
tremendous
commotion
nella
tore
her
hair
drew
her
nails
down
her
cheeks
as
if
she
would
tear
them
with
scratches
rocked
herself
forwards
and
backwards
and
from
side
to
side
the
tears
poured
down
her
brown
cheeks
she
screamed
and
blubbered
and
whimpered
in
quick
alternation
and
in
a
few
moments
tumbled
into
the
corner
of
a
big
chair
a
sobbing
and
convulsed
little
heap
of
womanhood
marietta
tried
to
quiet
her
and
was
so
sorry
for
her
that
she
could
almost
have
cried
too
until
she
remembered
the
detestable
things
which
nella
had
said
about
zorzi
and
which
the
woman
screams
had
driven
out
of
her
memory
for
an
instant
then
she
longed
to
beat
her
for
saying
them
and
still
nella
alternately
moaned
and
howled
and
twisted
herself
in
the
corner
of
the
big
chair
marietta
wondered
whether
her
servant
were
going
mad
and
whether
this
might
not
be
a
judgment
of
heaven
for
telling
such
atrocious
lies
about
poor
zorzi
in
that
case
it
was
of
course
deserved
thought
she
watching
nella
contortions
but
it
was
very
sudden
she
made
up
her
mind
to
call
the
other
women
and
turned
to
go
to
the
door
as
she
did
so
her
skirt
caught
a
comb
that
lay
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
swept
it
off
so
that
it
fell
upon
the
pavement
with
a
dry
rap
instantly
nella
sat
up
straight
and
rubbed
her
eyes
looking
about
for
the
cause
of
the
sound
when
she
saw
the
comb
the
instinct
returned
and
with
it
her
normal
condition
of
mind
she
picked
up
the
comb
with
a
quick
movement
shook
her
head
and
began
combing
marietta
hair
again
before
the
girl
could
sit
down
peace
was
restored
for
she
did
not
speak
again
as
she
helped
her
mistress
to
finish
dressing
but
though
marietta
tried
to
look
kindly
at
her
once
or
twice
nella
quite
refused
to
see
it
and
did
her
duty
without
ever
raising
her
eyes
it
was
soon
finished
for
the
pleasure
the
young
girl
had
taken
in
making
much
of
the
first
details
of
the
day
that
was
to
be
so
happy
was
all
gone
she
did
not
believe
her
woman
but
there
was
a
cloud
over
everything
and
she
was
in
haste
to
get
an
answer
to
the
question
which
it
would
not
be
easy
to
ask
she
must
know
if
zorzi
had
been
to
venice
during
the
night
for
until
she
knew
that
all
hope
of
peace
was
at
an
end
nella
had
meant
no
harm
but
she
had
played
the
fatal
little
part
in
which
destiny
loves
to
go
masking
through
life
endless
play
chapter
v
zorzi
had
slept
but
little
after
he
had
at
last
lain
down
upon
the
long
bench
in
the
laboratory
for
the
scene
in
which
he
had
been
the
chief
actor
that
night
had
made
a
profound
impression
upon
him
there
are
some
men
who
would
not
make
good
soldiers
but
who
can
face
sudden
and
desperate
danger
with
a
calmness
which
few
soldiers
really
possess
and
which
is
generally
accompanied
by
some
marked
superiority
of
mind
but
such
exceptional
natures
feel
the
reaction
that
follows
the
perilous
moment
far
more
than
the
average
fighting
man
they
are
those
who
sometimes
stem
the
rush
of
panic
and
turn
back
whole
armies
from
ruin
to
victorious
battle
they
are
those
who
spring
forward
from
the
crowd
to
save
life
when
some
terrible
accident
has
happened
as
if
they
were
risking
nothing
and
who
generally
succeed
in
what
they
attempt
but
they
are
not
men
who
learn
to
fight
every
day
as
carelessly
and
naturally
as
they
eat
drink
or
sleep
their
chance
of
action
may
come
but
once
or
twice
in
a
lifetime
yet
when
it
comes
it
finds
them
far
more
ready
and
cool
than
the
average
good
soldier
could
ever
be
like
strength
in
some
men
their
courage
seems
to
depend
on
quality
and
very
little
on
quantity
training
or
experience
zorzi
knew
very
well
that
although
the
young
gentlemen
who
were
playing
at
conspiracy
in
jacopo
house
did
not
constitute
a
serious
danger
to
the
republic
they
were
fully
aware
of
their
own
peril
and
would
not
have
hesitated
to
take
his
life
if
it
had
not
occurred
to
them
that
he
might
be
useful
his
intrepid
manner
had
saved
him
but
now
that
the
night
was
over
he
felt
such
a
weariness
and
lassitude
as
he
had
never
known
before
the
adventure
had
its
amusing
side
of
course
to
zorzi
who
knew
the
people
well
it
was
very
laughable
to
think
that
a
score
of
dissolute
young
patricians
should
first
fancy
themselves
able
to
raise
a
revolution
against
the
most
firmly
established
government
in
europe
and
should
then
squander
the
privacy
which
they
had
bought
at
a
frightful
risk
in
mere
gambling
and
but
there
was
nothing
humorous
about
the
oath
he
had
taken
in
the
first
place
it
had
been
sworn
in
solemn
earnest
and
was
therefore
binding
upon
him
secondly
if
he
broke
it
his
life
would
not
be
worth
a
day
purchase
he
was
brave
enough
to
have
scorned
the
second
consideration
but
he
was
far
too
honourable
to
try
and
escape
the
first
he
had
made
the
promises
to
save
his
life
it
was
true
and
under
great
pressure
but
he
would
have
despised
himself
as
a
coward
if
he
had
not
meant
to
keep
them
and
he
had
solemnly
bound
himself
to
respect
the
betrothed
brides
of
all
the
brethren
of
the
company
marietta
was
not
betrothed
to
jacopo
contarini
yet
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
she
would
be
before
many
days
to
respect
undoubtedly
meant
that
he
must
not
try
to
win
her
away
from
her
affianced
husband
if
he
had
ever
dreamt
that
in
some
fair
fantastically
improbable
future
marietta
could
be
his
wife
he
had
parted
with
the
right
to
dream
the
like
again
therefore
when
he
had
stood
awhile
looking
up
at
her
window
that
morning
he
sighed
heavily
and
went
away
he
had
never
had
any
hope
that
she
would
love
him
much
less
that
he
could
ever
marry
her
yet
he
felt
that
he
was
parting
with
the
only
thing
in
life
which
he
held
higher
than
his
art
and
that
the
parting
was
final
for
months
perhaps
for
years
he
had
never
closed
his
eyes
to
sleep
without
calling
up
her
face
and
repeating
her
name
he
had
never
got
up
in
the
morning
without
looking
forward
to
seeing
her
and
hearing
her
voice
before
he
should
lie
down
again
a
man
more
like
others
would
have
said
to
himself
that
no
promise
could
bind
him
to
anything
more
than
the
performance
of
an
action
or
the
abstention
from
one
and
that
the
right
of
dreaming
was
his
own
for
ever
but
zorzi
judged
differently
he
had
a
sensitiveness
that
was
rather
manly
than
masculine
he
had
scruples
of
which
he
was
not
ashamed
but
which
most
men
would
laugh
at
he
had
delicacies
of
conscience
in
his
most
private
thoughts
such
as
would
have
been
more
natural
in
a
cloistered
nun
living
in
ignorance
of
the
world
than
in
a
waif
who
had
faced
it
at
its
worst
and
almost
from
childhood
innocent
as
his
dream
had
been
he
resolved
to
part
with
it
and
never
to
dream
it
again
he
was
glad
that
marietta
had
taken
back
the
rose
he
had
picked
up
yesterday
if
she
had
not
he
would
have
forced
himself
to
throw
it
away
and
that
would
have
hurt
him
so
he
began
his
day
in
a
melancholy
mood
as
having
buried
out
of
sight
for
ever
something
that
was
very
dear
to
him
in
time
his
love
of
his
art
would
fill
the
place
of
the
other
love
but
on
this
first
day
he
went
about
in
silence
with
hungry
eyes
and
tightened
lips
like
a
man
who
is
starving
and
is
too
proud
to
ask
a
charity
he
waited
for
beroviero
at
the
door
of
his
house
as
he
did
every
morning
to
attend
him
to
the
laboratory
the
old
man
looked
at
him
inquiringly
and
zorzi
bent
his
head
a
little
to
explain
that
he
had
done
what
had
been
required
of
him
and
he
followed
his
master
across
the
wooden
bridge
when
they
were
alone
in
the
laboratory
he
told
as
much
of
his
story
as
was
necessary
he
had
found
the
lord
jacopo
contarini
at
his
house
with
a
party
of
friends
he
said
and
he
added
at
once
that
they
were
all
men
contarini
had
bidden
him
speak
before
them
all
but
he
had
whispered
his
message
so
that
only
contarini
should
hear
it
after
a
time
he
had
been
allowed
to
come
away
no
contarini
had
given
no
direct
answer
he
had
sent
no
reply
he
had
only
said
aloud
to
his
friends
that
the
message
he
received
was
expected
that
was
all
the
friends
who
were
there
zorzi
answered
with
perfect
truth
that
he
did
not
remember
to
have
seen
any
of
them
before
beroviero
was
silent
for
a
while
considering
the
story
he
would
have
thought
it
discourteous
to
leave
his
friends
he
said
at
last
or
to
whisper
an
answer
to
a
messenger
in
their
presence
he
said
that
he
had
expected
the
message
he
will
therefore
come
to
this
zorzi
answered
nothing
for
he
was
glad
not
to
be
questioned
further
about
what
had
happened
presently
beroviero
settled
to
his
work
with
his
usual
concentration
for
many
months
he
had
been
experimenting
in
the
making
of
fine
red
glass
of
a
certain
tone
of
which
he
had
brought
home
a
small
fragment
from
one
of
his
journeys
hitherto
he
had
failed
in
every
attempt
he
had
tried
one
mixture
after
another
and
had
produced
a
score
of
different
specimens
but
not
one
of
them
had
that
marvellous
light
in
it
like
sunshine
striking
through
bright
blood
which
he
was
striving
to
obtain
it
was
nearly
three
weeks
since
his
small
furnace
had
been
allowed
to
go
out
and
by
this
time
he
alone
knew
what
the
glowing
pots
contained
for
he
wrote
down
very
carefully
what
he
did
and
in
characters
which
he
believed
no
one
could
understand
but
himself
as
usual
every
morning
he
proceeded
to
make
trial
of
the
materials
fused
in
the
night
the
furnace
though
not
large
held
three
crucibles
before
each
of
which
was
the
opening
still
called
by
the
italian
name
through
which
the
materials
are
put
into
the
pots
to
melt
into
glass
and
by
which
the
melted
glass
is
taken
out
on
the
end
of
the
or
in
a
copper
ladle
when
it
is
to
be
tested
by
casting
it
the
furnace
was
arched
from
end
to
end
and
about
the
height
of
a
tall
man
the
working
end
was
like
a
round
oven
with
three
glowing
openings
the
straight
part
some
twenty
feet
long
contained
the
annealing
oven
through
which
the
finished
pieces
were
made
to
move
slowly
on
iron
during
many
hours
till
the
glass
had
passed
from
extreme
heat
almost
to
the
temperature
of
the
air
the
most
delicate
vessels
ever
produced
in
murano
have
all
been
made
in
single
furnaces
the
materials
being
melted
converted
into
glass
and
finally
annealed
by
one
fire
at
least
one
old
furnace
is
standing
and
still
in
use
which
has
existed
for
centuries
and
those
made
nowadays
are
substantially
like
it
in
every
important
respect
zorzi
stood
holding
a
copper
ladle
ready
to
take
out
a
specimen
of
the
glass
containing
the
ingredients
most
lately
added
a
few
steps
from
the
furnace
a
thick
and
smooth
plate
of
iron
was
placed
on
a
heavy
wooden
table
and
upon
this
the
liquid
glass
was
to
be
poured
out
to
cool
it
must
be
time
said
beroviero
unless
the
boys
forgot
to
turn
the
at
one
of
the
watches
the
hour
is
all
but
run
out
and
it
must
be
the
twelfth
since
i
put
in
the
materials
i
turned
it
myself
an
hour
after
midnight
said
zorzi
and
also
the
next
time
when
it
was
dawn
it
runs
three
hours
judging
by
the
time
of
sunrise
it
is
running
right
then
make
the
trial
beroviero
stood
opposite
zorzi
his
face
pale
with
heat
and
excitement
his
fiery
eyes
reflecting
the
fierce
light
from
the
as
he
bent
down
to
watch
the
copper
ladle
go
in
zorzi
had
wrapped
a
cloth
round
his
right
hand
against
the
heat
and
he
thrust
the
great
spoon
through
the
round
orifice
though
it
was
the
hundredth
time
of
testing
the
old
man
watched
his
movements
with
intensest
interest
quickly
quickly
he
cried
quite
unconscious
that
he
was
speaking
there
was
no
need
of
hurrying
zorzi
in
two
steps
he
had
reached
the
table
and
the
white
hot
stuff
spread
out
over
the
iron
plate
instantly
turning
to
a
greenish
yellow
then
to
a
pale
then
to
a
deep
and
glowing
red
as
it
felt
the
cool
metal
the
two
men
stood
watching
it
closely
for
it
was
thin
and
would
soon
cool
zorzi
was
too
wise
to
say
anything
beroviero
look
of
interest
gradually
turned
into
an
expression
of
disappointment
another
failure
he
said
with
a
resignation
which
no
one
would
have
expected
in
such
a
man
his
practised
eyes
had
guessed
the
exact
hue
of
the
glass
while
it
still
lay
on
the
iron
half
cooled
and
far
too
hot
to
touch
zorzi
took
a
short
rod
and
pushed
the
round
sheet
till
a
part
of
it
was
over
the
edge
of
the
table
it
is
the
best
we
have
had
yet
he
observed
looking
at
it
is
it
asked
beroviero
with
little
interest
and
without
giving
the
glass
another
glance
it
is
not
what
i
am
trying
to
get
it
is
the
colour
of
wine
not
of
blood
make
something
zorzi
while
i
write
down
the
result
of
the
experiment
he
took
big
pen
and
the
sheet
of
rough
paper
on
which
he
had
already
noted
the
proportions
of
the
materials
and
he
began
to
write
sitting
at
the
large
table
before
the
open
window
zorzi
took
the
long
iron
cleaned
it
with
a
cloth
and
pushed
the
end
through
the
orifice
from
which
he
had
taken
the
specimen
he
drew
it
back
with
a
little
lump
of
melted
glass
sticking
to
it
holding
the
to
his
lips
he
blew
a
little
and
the
lump
swelled
and
he
swung
the
pipe
sharply
in
a
circle
so
that
the
glass
lengthened
to
the
shape
of
a
pear
and
he
blew
again
and
it
grew
at
the
of
the
furnace
he
heated
it
for
it
was
cooling
quickly
and
he
had
his
iron
pontil
ready
as
there
was
no
one
to
help
him
and
he
easily
performed
the
feat
of
taking
a
little
hot
glass
on
it
from
the
pot
and
attaching
it
to
the
further
end
of
the
pear
if
beroviero
had
been
watching
him
he
would
have
been
astonished
at
the
skill
with
which
the
young
man
accomplished
what
it
requires
two
persons
to
do
but
zorzi
had
tricks
of
his
own
and
the
pontil
supported
itself
on
a
board
while
he
cracked
the
pear
from
the
with
a
wet
iron
as
well
as
if
a
boy
had
held
it
in
place
for
him
and
then
heating
and
reheating
the
piece
he
fashioned
it
and
cut
it
with
tongs
and
shears
rolling
the
pontil
on
the
flat
arms
of
his
stool
with
his
left
hand
and
modelling
the
glass
with
his
right
till
at
last
he
let
it
cool
to
its
natural
colour
holding
it
straight
downward
and
then
swinging
it
slowly
so
that
it
should
fan
itself
in
the
air
it
was
a
graceful
calix
now
of
a
deep
wine
red
clear
and
transparent
as
claret
zorzi
turned
to
the
window
to
show
it
to
his
master
not
for
the
sake
of
the
workmanship
but
of
the
colour
the
old
man
head
was
bent
over
his
writing
marietta
was
standing
outside
and
her
eyes
met
zorzi
he
did
not
blush
as
he
had
blushed
yesterday
when
he
looked
up
from
the
fire
and
saw
her
he
merely
inclined
his
head
respectfully
to
acknowledge
her
presence
and
then
he
stood
by
the
table
waiting
for
the
master
to
notice
him
and
not
bestowing
another
glance
on
the
young
girl
beroviero
turned
to
him
at
last
he
was
so
used
to
marietta
presence
that
he
paid
no
attention
to
her
what
is
that
thing
he
asked
contemptuously
a
specimen
of
the
glass
we
tried
answered
the
young
man
i
have
blown
it
thin
to
show
the
colour
a
man
who
can
have
such
execrable
taste
as
to
make
a
of
coloured
glass
does
not
deserve
to
know
as
much
as
you
do
but
it
is
very
pretty
said
marietta
through
the
window
and
bending
forward
she
rested
her
white
hands
on
the
table
among
the
little
heaps
of
chemicals
anneal
it
and
give
it
to
me
she
added
keep
such
a
thing
in
my
house
asked
beroviero
scornfully
break
up
that
rubbish
he
added
roughly
speaking
to
zorzi
without
a
word
zorzi
smashed
the
calix
off
the
iron
into
an
old
earthen
jar
already
half
full
of
broken
glass
then
he
put
the
pontil
in
its
place
and
went
to
tend
the
fire
marietta
left
the
window
and
entered
the
room
am
i
disturbing
you
she
asked
gently
as
she
stood
by
her
father
no
i
have
finished
writing
he
laid
down
his
pen
another
failure
yes
perhaps
i
do
not
bring
you
good
luck
with
your
experiments
suggested
the
girl
leaning
down
and
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
the
crabbed
writing
so
that
her
cheek
almost
touched
his
is
that
why
you
wish
to
send
me
away
beroviero
turned
in
his
chair
raised
his
heavy
brows
and
looked
up
into
her
face
but
said
nothing
nella
has
just
told
me
that
you
have
ordered
my
wedding
gown
continued
marietta
we
are
not
alone
said
her
father
in
a
low
voice
zorzi
probably
knows
what
is
the
gossip
of
the
house
and
what
i
have
been
the
last
to
hear
answered
the
young
girl
besides
you
trust
him
with
all
your
secrets
yes
i
trust
him
assented
beroviero
but
these
are
private
matters
so
private
that
my
knows
more
of
them
than
i
do
you
encourage
her
to
talk
marietta
laughed
for
she
was
determined
to
be
in
spite
of
what
she
said
if
i
did
that
would
not
teach
her
things
which
i
do
not
know
myself
is
it
true
that
you
have
ordered
the
gown
to
be
embroidered
with
pearls
you
like
pearls
do
you
not
asked
beroviero
with
a
little
anxiety
you
see
cried
marietta
triumphantly
nella
knows
all
about
it
i
was
going
to
tell
you
this
morning
said
her
father
in
a
tone
of
annoyance
by
my
faith
one
can
keep
nothing
secret
one
can
not
even
give
you
a
surprise
nella
knows
everything
returned
the
girl
sitting
on
the
corner
of
the
table
and
looking
from
her
father
to
zorzi
that
must
be
why
you
chose
her
for
my
when
i
was
a
little
girl
she
knows
all
that
happens
in
the
house
by
day
and
night
so
that
i
sometimes
think
she
never
sleeps
zorzi
looked
furtively
towards
the
table
for
he
could
not
help
hearing
all
that
was
said
for
instance
continued
marietta
watching
him
she
knows
that
last
night
some
one
unlocked
the
chain
that
moors
the
skiff
and
rowed
away
towards
venice
to
her
surprise
zorzi
showed
no
embarrassment
he
had
made
up
the
fire
and
now
sat
down
at
a
little
distance
on
one
of
the
flat
arms
of
the
his
face
was
pale
and
quiet
and
his
eyes
did
not
avoid
hers
if
i
caught
any
one
using
my
boat
without
my
leave
i
would
make
him
pay
dear
said
beroviero
but
without
anger
as
if
he
were
stating
a
general
truth
whoever
it
was
who
took
the
boat
brought
it
back
an
hour
after
midnight
locked
the
padlock
again
and
went
away
said
marietta
tell
nella
that
i
am
much
indebted
to
her
for
her
watchfulness
she
is
as
good
as
a
tell
her
to
come
and
wake
me
if
she
sees
any
one
taking
the
boat
again
she
says
she
knows
who
took
it
last
night
observed
marietta
who
was
puzzled
by
the
attitude
of
the
two
men
she
had
now
decided
that
it
had
not
been
zorzi
who
had
used
the
boat
but
on
the
other
hand
the
story
did
not
rouse
her
father
anger
as
she
had
expected
did
she
tell
you
the
man
name
yes
who
was
it
she
said
it
was
zorzi
marietta
laughed
incredulously
as
she
spoke
and
zorzi
smiled
quietly
beroviero
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
looked
out
of
the
window
listen
to
me
he
said
at
last
tell
your
graceless
gossip
of
a
that
i
will
answer
for
zorzi
and
that
the
next
time
she
hears
any
one
taking
the
boat
at
night
she
had
better
come
and
call
me
and
open
her
eyes
a
little
wider
tell
her
also
that
i
entertain
proper
persons
to
take
care
of
my
property
without
any
help
from
her
tell
her
furthermore
that
she
talks
too
much
you
should
not
listen
to
a
servant
miserable
chatter
i
will
tell
her
replied
marietta
meekly
did
you
say
that
the
gown
was
to
be
embroidered
with
pearls
and
silver
father
or
with
pearls
and
gold
i
believe
i
said
gold
answered
the
old
man
discontentedly
and
when
will
it
be
ready
in
about
two
months
i
daresay
so
you
mean
to
marry
me
in
two
months
concluded
marietta
that
is
not
a
long
time
should
you
prefer
two
years
inquired
beroviero
with
increasing
annoyance
marietta
slipped
from
the
table
to
her
feet
it
depends
on
the
bridegroom
she
answered
perhaps
i
may
prefer
to
wait
a
lifetime
she
moved
towards
the
door
oh
you
shall
be
satisfied
with
the
bridegroom
i
promise
you
that
the
old
man
looked
after
her
at
the
door
she
turned
her
head
smiling
i
may
be
hard
to
please
she
said
quietly
and
she
went
out
into
the
garden
when
she
was
gone
beroviero
shut
the
window
carefully
and
though
the
round
panes
let
in
the
light
plentifully
they
effectually
prevented
any
one
from
seeing
into
the
room
the
door
was
already
closed
you
should
have
been
more
careful
he
said
to
zorzi
in
a
tone
of
reproach
you
should
not
have
let
any
one
see
you
when
you
took
the
boat
if
the
woman
spent
half
the
night
looking
out
of
her
window
sir
i
do
not
understand
how
i
could
have
taken
the
boat
without
being
seen
by
her
well
well
there
is
no
harm
done
and
you
could
not
help
it
i
daresay
i
have
something
else
to
say
you
saw
the
lord
jacopo
last
night
what
do
you
think
of
him
he
is
a
young
man
should
not
any
girl
be
glad
to
get
such
a
handsome
husband
what
do
you
think
and
his
name
too
one
of
the
best
in
the
great
council
they
say
he
has
a
few
debts
but
his
father
is
very
rich
and
has
promised
me
that
he
will
pay
everything
if
only
his
son
can
be
brought
to
marry
and
lead
a
graver
life
what
do
you
think
he
is
a
very
handsome
young
man
said
zorzi
loyally
what
should
i
think
it
is
a
most
honourable
marriage
for
your
house
i
hear
no
great
harm
of
jacopo
continued
beroviero
more
familiarly
his
father
is
miserly
we
have
spent
much
time
in
the
preliminary
arrangements
without
the
knowledge
of
the
son
and
the
old
man
is
very
grasping
he
would
take
all
my
fortune
for
the
dowry
if
he
could
but
he
has
to
do
with
a
beroviero
smiled
thoughtfully
zorzi
was
silent
for
he
was
suffering
you
may
wonder
why
i
sent
that
message
last
night
began
the
master
again
since
matters
are
already
so
far
settled
with
jacopo
father
you
would
suppose
that
nothing
more
remained
but
to
marry
the
couple
in
the
presence
of
both
families
should
you
not
i
know
little
of
such
affairs
sir
answered
zorzi
that
would
be
the
usual
way
continued
beroviero
but
i
will
not
marry
marietta
against
her
will
i
have
always
told
her
so
she
shall
see
her
future
husband
before
she
is
betrothed
and
persuade
herself
with
her
own
eyes
that
she
is
not
being
deceived
into
marrying
a
hunchback
but
supposing
that
after
all
the
lord
jacopo
should
not
be
to
her
taste
suggested
zorzi
would
you
break
off
the
match
break
off
the
match
cried
beroviero
indignantly
never
not
to
her
taste
the
handsomest
man
in
venice
with
a
great
name
and
a
fortune
to
come
it
would
not
be
my
fault
if
the
girl
went
mad
and
refused
i
would
make
her
like
him
if
she
dared
to
hesitate
a
moment
even
against
her
will
she
has
no
will
in
the
matter
retorted
beroviero
angrily
but
you
have
always
told
her
that
you
would
not
marry
her
against
her
will
do
not
anger
me
zorzi
do
not
try
your
specious
logic
with
me
invent
no
absurd
arguments
man
against
her
will
indeed
how
should
she
know
any
will
but
mine
in
the
matter
i
shall
certainly
not
marry
her
against
her
will
she
shall
will
what
i
please
neither
more
nor
less
if
that
is
your
point
of
view
said
zorzi
there
is
no
room
for
argument
of
course
not
any
reasonable
person
would
laugh
at
the
idea
that
a
girl
in
her
senses
should
not
be
glad
to
marry
jacopo
contarini
especially
after
having
seen
him
if
she
were
not
glad
she
would
not
be
in
her
senses
in
other
words
she
would
not
be
sane
and
should
be
treated
as
a
lunatic
for
her
own
good
would
you
let
a
lunatic
do
as
he
liked
if
he
tried
to
jump
out
of
the
window
the
mere
thought
is
absurd
quite
said
zorzi
sad
as
he
was
he
could
almost
have
laughed
at
the
old
inconsequent
speeches
i
am
glad
that
you
so
heartily
agree
with
me
answered
beroviero
in
perfect
sincerity
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
i
would
ask
your
opinion
about
my
daughter
marriage
you
would
not
expect
that
but
i
know
that
i
can
trust
you
for
we
have
worked
together
a
long
time
and
i
am
used
to
hearing
what
you
have
to
say
you
have
always
been
very
good
to
me
replied
zorzi
gratefully
you
have
always
been
faithful
to
me
said
the
old
man
laying
his
hand
gently
on
zorzi
shoulder
i
know
what
that
means
in
this
world
as
soon
as
there
was
no
question
of
opposing
his
despotic
will
his
kindly
nature
asserted
itself
for
he
was
a
man
subject
to
quick
changes
of
humour
but
in
reality
affectionate
i
am
going
to
trust
you
much
more
than
hitherto
he
continued
my
sons
are
grown
men
independent
of
me
but
willing
to
get
from
me
all
they
can
if
they
were
true
artists
if
i
could
trust
their
taste
they
should
have
had
my
secrets
long
ago
but
they
are
mere
and
it
is
better
that
they
should
enrich
themselves
with
the
tasteless
rubbish
they
make
in
their
furnaces
than
degrade
our
art
by
cheapening
what
should
be
rare
and
costly
am
i
right
indeed
you
are
zorzi
now
spoke
in
a
tone
of
real
conviction
if
i
thought
you
were
really
capable
of
making
coloured
like
that
abominable
object
you
made
this
morning
with
the
idea
that
they
could
ever
be
used
you
should
not
stay
on
venetian
soil
a
day
resumed
the
old
man
energetically
you
would
be
as
bad
as
my
sons
or
worse
even
they
have
enough
sense
to
know
that
half
the
beauty
of
a
cup
when
it
is
used
lies
in
the
colour
of
the
wine
itself
which
must
be
seen
through
it
but
i
forgive
you
because
you
were
only
anxious
to
blow
the
glass
thin
in
order
to
show
me
the
tint
you
know
better
that
is
why
i
mean
to
trust
you
in
a
very
grave
matter
zorzi
bent
his
head
respectfully
but
said
nothing
i
am
obliged
to
make
a
journey
before
my
daughter
marriage
takes
place
continued
beroviero
i
shall
entrust
to
you
the
manuscript
secrets
i
possess
they
are
in
a
sealed
package
so
that
you
can
not
read
them
but
they
will
be
in
your
care
if
i
leave
them
with
any
one
else
my
sons
will
try
to
get
possession
of
them
while
i
am
away
during
my
last
journey
i
carried
them
with
me
but
i
am
growing
old
life
is
uncertain
especially
when
a
man
is
travelling
and
i
would
rather
leave
the
packet
with
you
it
will
be
safer
it
shall
be
altogether
safe
said
zorzi
no
one
shall
guess
that
i
have
it
no
one
must
know
i
would
take
you
with
me
on
this
journey
but
i
wish
you
to
go
on
with
the
experiments
i
have
been
making
we
shall
save
time
if
you
try
some
of
the
mixtures
while
i
am
away
when
it
is
too
hot
let
the
furnace
go
out
but
who
will
take
charge
of
your
daughter
sir
asked
zorzi
you
can
not
leave
her
alone
in
the
house
my
son
giovanni
and
his
wife
will
live
in
my
house
while
i
am
away
i
have
thought
of
everything
if
you
choose
you
may
bring
your
belongings
here
and
sleep
and
eat
in
the
i
should
prefer
it
so
should
i
do
not
want
my
sons
to
pry
into
what
we
are
doing
you
can
hide
the
packet
here
where
they
will
not
think
of
looking
for
it
when
you
go
out
lock
the
door
when
you
are
in
giovanni
will
not
come
you
will
have
the
place
to
yourself
and
the
boys
who
feed
the
fire
at
night
will
not
disturb
you
of
course
my
daughter
will
never
come
here
while
i
am
away
you
will
be
quite
alone
when
do
you
go
asked
zorzi
on
monday
morning
on
sunday
i
shall
take
marietta
to
saint
mark
when
she
has
seen
her
husband
the
betrothal
can
take
place
at
once
zorzi
was
silent
for
the
future
looked
black
enough
he
already
saw
himself
shut
up
in
the
for
two
long
months
or
not
much
less
as
effectually
separated
from
marietta
by
the
narrow
canal
as
if
an
ocean
were
between
them
she
would
never
cross
over
and
spend
an
hour
in
the
little
garden
then
and
she
would
be
under
the
care
of
giovanni
beroviero
who
hated
him
as
he
well
knew
chapter
vi
aristarchi
rose
early
though
it
had
been
broad
dawn
when
he
had
entered
his
home
he
lived
not
far
from
the
house
of
the
agnus
dei
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
same
canal
but
beyond
the
baker
bridge
his
house
was
small
and
unpretentious
a
little
wooden
building
in
two
stories
with
a
small
door
opening
to
the
water
and
another
at
the
back
giving
access
to
a
patch
of
dilapidated
and
overgrown
garden
whence
a
second
door
opened
upon
a
dismal
and
unsavoury
alley
one
faithful
man
who
had
followed
him
through
many
adventures
rendered
him
such
services
as
he
needed
prepared
the
food
he
liked
and
guarded
the
house
in
his
absence
the
fellow
was
far
too
much
in
awe
of
his
terrible
master
to
play
the
spy
or
to
ask
inopportune
questions
the
greek
put
on
the
rich
dress
of
a
merchant
captain
of
his
own
people
the
black
coat
thickly
embroidered
with
gold
the
breeches
of
dark
blue
cloth
the
almost
transparent
linen
shirt
open
at
the
throat
a
large
blue
cap
of
silk
and
cloth
was
set
far
back
on
his
head
showing
all
the
bony
forehead
and
his
beard
and
shaggy
hair
had
been
combed
as
smooth
as
their
shaggy
nature
would
allow
he
wore
a
magnificent
belt
fully
two
hands
wide
in
which
were
stuck
three
knives
of
formidable
length
and
breadth
in
finely
chased
silver
sheaths
his
muscular
legs
were
encased
in
leathern
gaiters
ornamented
with
gold
and
silver
and
on
his
feet
he
wore
broad
slippers
from
constantinople
the
dress
was
much
the
same
as
that
which
the
turks
had
found
there
a
few
years
earlier
and
which
they
soon
amalgamated
with
their
own
it
set
off
the
captain
vast
breadth
of
shoulder
and
massive
limbs
and
as
he
stepped
into
his
hired
boat
the
idlers
at
the
gazed
upon
him
with
an
admiration
of
which
he
was
well
aware
for
besides
being
very
splendidly
dressed
he
looked
as
if
he
could
have
swept
them
all
into
the
canal
with
a
turn
of
his
hand
without
saying
whither
he
was
bound
he
directed
the
oarsman
through
the
narrow
channels
until
he
reached
the
shallow
lagoon
the
boatman
asked
whither
he
should
go
to
murano
answered
the
greek
and
keep
over
by
saint
michael
for
the
tide
is
low
the
boatman
had
already
understood
that
his
passenger
knew
venice
almost
as
well
as
he
the
boat
shot
forward
at
a
good
rate
under
the
bending
oar
and
in
twenty
minutes
aristarchi
was
at
the
entrance
to
the
canal
of
san
piero
and
within
sight
of
beroviero
house
easy
there
said
the
greek
holding
up
his
hand
do
you
know
murano
well
my
man
as
well
as
venice
sir
whose
house
is
that
which
has
the
upper
story
built
on
columns
over
the
footway
it
belongs
to
messer
angelo
beroviero
his
takes
up
all
the
left
aide
of
the
canal
as
far
as
the
bridge
and
beyond
the
bridge
i
can
see
two
new
houses
on
the
same
side
whose
are
they
they
belong
to
the
two
sons
of
messer
angelo
beroviero
who
have
furnaces
of
their
own
all
the
way
to
the
corner
of
the
grand
canal
is
there
a
grand
canal
in
murano
asked
aristarchi
they
call
it
so
answered
the
boatman
with
some
contempt
the
beroviero
have
several
houses
on
it
too
it
seems
to
me
that
beroviero
owns
most
of
murano
observed
the
greek
he
must
be
very
rich
he
is
by
far
the
richest
but
there
is
alvise
trevisan
a
rich
man
too
and
there
are
two
or
three
others
the
island
and
all
the
are
theirs
amongst
them
i
have
business
with
messer
angelo
said
aristarchi
but
if
he
is
such
a
great
man
he
will
hardly
be
in
the
i
will
ask
answered
the
boatman
in
a
few
minutes
he
made
his
boat
fast
to
the
steps
before
the
went
ashore
and
knocked
at
the
door
aristarchi
leaned
back
in
his
seat
chewing
pistachio
nuts
which
he
carried
in
an
embroidered
leathern
bag
at
his
belt
his
right
hand
played
mechanically
with
the
short
string
of
thick
amber
beads
which
he
used
for
counting
the
june
sun
blazed
down
upon
his
swarthy
face
at
the
grating
beside
the
door
the
porter
head
appeared
partially
visible
behind
the
bars
is
messer
angelo
beroviero
within
inquired
the
boatman
civilly
what
is
your
business
asked
the
porter
in
a
tone
of
surly
contempt
instead
of
answering
the
question
there
is
a
rich
foreign
gentleman
here
who
desires
to
speak
with
him
answered
the
boatman
is
he
the
pope
asked
the
porter
with
fine
irony
no
sir
said
the
other
intimidated
by
the
fellow
manner
he
is
a
rich
tell
him
to
wait
then
and
the
surly
head
disappeared
the
boatman
supposed
that
the
man
was
gone
to
speak
with
his
master
and
waited
patiently
by
the
door
aristarchi
chewed
his
pistachio
nut
till
there
was
nothing
left
at
which
time
he
reached
the
end
of
his
patience
he
argued
that
it
was
a
good
sign
if
angelo
beroviero
kept
rich
strangers
waiting
at
his
gate
for
it
showed
that
he
had
no
need
of
their
custom
on
the
other
hand
the
greek
dignity
was
offended
now
that
he
had
been
made
to
wait
too
long
for
he
was
hasty
by
nature
once
in
a
fit
of
irritation
with
a
candiot
who
stammered
out
of
sheer
fright
the
captain
had
ordered
him
to
be
hanged
having
finished
his
nut
he
stood
up
in
the
boat
and
stepped
ashore
knock
again
he
said
to
the
boatman
who
obeyed
there
was
no
answer
this
time
i
can
hear
the
fellow
inside
said
the
boatman
the
grating
was
too
high
for
a
man
to
look
through
it
from
outside
aristarchi
laid
his
knotty
hands
on
the
stone
sill
and
pulled
himself
up
till
his
face
was
against
the
grating
he
now
looked
in
and
saw
the
porter
sitting
in
his
chair
have
you
taken
my
message
to
your
master
inquired
the
greek
the
porter
looked
up
in
surprise
which
increased
when
he
caught
sight
of
the
ferocious
face
of
the
speaker
but
he
was
not
to
be
intimidated
so
easily
messer
angelo
is
not
to
be
disturbed
at
his
studies
he
said
if
you
wait
till
noon
perhaps
he
will
come
out
to
go
to
dinner
perhaps
repeated
aristarchi
still
hanging
by
his
hands
do
you
think
i
shall
wait
all
day
i
do
not
know
that
is
your
affair
precisely
and
i
do
not
mean
to
wait
then
go
away
but
the
greek
had
come
on
an
exploring
expedition
in
which
he
had
nothing
to
lose
hauling
himself
up
a
little
higher
till
his
mouth
was
close
to
the
grating
he
hailed
the
house
as
he
would
have
hailed
a
ship
at
sea
in
a
voice
of
thunder
ahoy
there
is
any
one
within
ahoy
ahoy
this
was
more
than
the
porter
equanimity
could
bear
he
looked
about
for
a
weapon
with
which
to
attack
the
greek
face
through
the
bars
heaping
upon
him
a
torrent
of
abuse
in
the
meantime
son
of
dogs
and
mules
he
cried
in
a
rising
growl
ill
befall
the
foul
souls
of
thy
dead
and
of
their
dead
before
them
ahoy
oh
ahoy
bellowed
the
greek
who
now
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
situation
the
boatman
anxious
for
drink
money
and
convinced
that
his
huge
employer
would
get
the
better
of
the
porter
had
obligingly
gone
down
upon
his
hands
and
knees
thrusting
his
broad
back
under
the
feet
so
that
aristarchi
stood
upon
him
and
was
now
prepared
to
prolong
the
interview
without
any
further
effort
his
terrific
shouts
rang
through
the
corridor
to
the
garden
the
first
person
to
enter
the
little
lodge
was
marietta
herself
and
the
greek
broke
off
short
in
the
middle
of
another
tremendous
yell
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
she
turned
her
face
up
to
him
quite
fearlessly
and
was
very
much
inclined
to
laugh
as
she
saw
the
sudden
change
in
his
expression
madam
he
said
with
great
politeness
i
beg
you
to
forgive
my
manner
of
announcing
myself
if
your
porter
were
more
obliging
i
should
have
been
admitted
in
the
ordinary
way
what
is
this
atrocious
disturbance
asked
zorzi
entering
before
marietta
could
answer
pray
leave
the
fellow
to
me
he
added
speaking
to
marietta
who
cast
one
more
glance
at
aristarchi
and
went
out
sir
said
the
captain
blandly
i
admit
that
my
behaviour
may
give
you
some
right
to
call
me
but
i
trust
that
my
apology
will
make
you
consider
me
a
gentleman
like
yourself
your
porter
altogether
refused
to
take
a
message
to
messer
angelo
beroviero
may
i
ask
whether
you
are
his
son
sir
no
sir
you
say
that
you
wish
to
speak
with
the
master
i
can
take
a
message
to
him
but
i
am
not
sure
that
he
will
see
any
one
aristarchi
imagined
that
beroviero
made
himself
inaccessible
in
order
to
increase
the
general
idea
of
his
wealth
and
importance
he
resolved
to
convey
a
strong
impression
of
his
own
standing
i
am
the
chief
partner
in
a
great
house
of
greek
merchants
settled
in
palermo
he
said
my
name
is
charalambos
aristarchi
and
i
desire
the
honour
of
speaking
with
messer
angelo
about
the
purchase
of
several
cargoes
of
glass
for
the
king
of
sicily
i
will
deliver
your
message
sir
said
zorzi
pray
wait
a
minute
i
will
open
the
door
aristarchi
big
head
disappeared
at
last
yes
growled
the
porter
to
zorzi
open
the
door
yourself
and
take
the
blame
the
man
has
the
face
of
a
turkish
pirate
and
his
voice
is
like
the
bellowing
of
several
bulls
zorzi
unbarred
the
door
which
opened
inward
and
aristarchi
turned
a
little
sideways
in
order
to
enter
for
his
shoulders
would
have
touched
the
two
the
slight
and
gracefully
built
dalmatian
looked
at
him
with
some
curiosity
standing
aside
to
let
him
pass
before
barring
the
door
again
aristarchi
though
not
much
taller
than
himself
was
the
biggest
man
he
had
ever
seen
he
thanked
zorzi
who
pushed
forward
the
porter
only
chair
for
him
to
sit
on
while
he
waited
i
will
bring
you
an
answer
immediately
said
zorzi
and
disappeared
down
the
corridor
aristarchi
sat
down
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
and
took
a
pistachio
nut
from
his
pouch
master
porter
he
began
in
a
friendly
tone
can
you
tell
me
who
that
beautiful
lady
is
who
came
here
a
moment
ago
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
snarled
the
porter
beginning
to
strip
the
outer
leaves
from
a
large
onion
which
he
pulled
from
a
string
of
them
hanging
by
the
wall
aristarchi
said
nothing
for
a
few
moments
but
watched
the
man
with
an
air
of
interest
were
you
ever
a
pirate
he
inquired
presently
no
i
never
served
in
your
crew
the
porter
was
not
often
at
a
loss
for
a
surly
answer
the
greek
laughed
outright
in
genuine
amusement
i
like
your
company
my
friend
he
said
i
should
like
to
spend
the
day
here
as
the
devil
said
to
saint
anthony
concluded
the
porter
aristarchi
laughed
again
it
was
long
since
he
had
enjoyed
such
amusing
conversation
and
there
was
a
certain
novelty
in
not
being
feared
he
repeated
his
first
question
however
remembering
that
he
had
not
come
in
search
of
diversion
but
to
gather
information
who
was
the
beautiful
lady
he
asked
she
is
messer
daughter
is
she
not
a
man
who
asks
a
question
when
he
knows
the
answer
is
either
a
fool
or
a
knave
choose
as
you
please
thanks
friend
answered
aristarchi
still
grinning
and
showing
his
jagged
teeth
i
leave
the
first
choice
to
you
whichever
you
take
i
will
take
the
other
for
if
you
call
me
a
knave
i
shall
call
you
a
fool
but
if
you
think
me
a
fool
i
am
quite
satisfied
that
you
should
be
the
knave
the
porter
snarled
vaguely
feeling
that
the
greek
had
the
better
of
him
at
that
moment
zorzi
returned
and
his
coming
put
an
end
to
the
exchange
of
amenities
my
master
has
no
long
leisure
he
said
but
he
begs
you
to
come
in
they
left
the
lodge
together
and
the
porter
watched
them
as
they
went
down
the
dark
corridor
muttering
unholy
things
about
the
visitor
who
had
disturbed
him
and
bestowing
a
few
curses
on
zorzi
then
he
went
back
to
peeling
his
onions
as
aristarchi
went
through
the
garden
he
saw
marietta
sitting
under
the
making
a
little
net
of
coloured
beads
her
face
was
turned
from
him
and
bent
down
but
when
he
had
passed
she
glanced
furtively
after
him
wondering
at
his
size
but
her
eyes
followed
zorzi
till
the
two
reached
the
door
and
went
in
a
moment
later
zorzi
came
out
again
leaving
his
master
and
the
greek
together
marietta
looked
down
at
once
lest
her
eyes
should
betray
her
gladness
for
she
knew
that
zorzi
would
not
go
back
and
could
not
leave
the
so
that
site
should
necessarily
be
alone
with
him
while
the
interview
in
the
laboratory
lasted
he
came
a
little
way
down
the
path
then
stopped
took
a
short
knife
from
his
wallet
and
began
to
trim
away
a
few
withered
sprigs
from
a
she
waited
a
moment
but
he
showed
no
signs
of
coming
nearer
so
she
spoke
to
him
will
you
come
here
she
asked
softly
looking
towards
him
with
eyes
he
slipped
the
knife
back
into
his
pouch
and
walked
quickly
to
her
side
she
looked
down
again
threading
the
coloured
beads
that
half
filled
a
small
basket
in
her
lap
may
i
ask
you
a
question
her
voice
had
a
little
persuasive
hesitation
in
it
as
if
she
wished
him
to
understand
that
the
answer
would
be
a
favour
of
which
she
was
anything
but
certain
anything
you
will
said
zorzi
provided
i
do
not
ask
about
my
father
secret
a
little
laughter
trembled
in
the
words
you
were
so
severe
yesterday
you
know
i
am
almost
afraid
ever
to
ask
you
anything
again
i
will
answer
as
well
as
i
can
well
tell
me
this
did
you
really
take
the
boat
and
go
to
venice
last
night
yes
marietta
hand
moved
with
the
needle
among
the
beads
but
she
did
not
thread
one
nella
had
been
right
after
all
why
did
you
go
zorzi
the
question
came
in
a
lower
tone
that
was
full
of
regret
the
master
sent
me
answered
zorzi
looking
down
at
her
hair
and
wishing
that
he
could
see
her
face
his
wish
was
almost
instantly
fulfilled
after
the
slightest
pause
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
lovely
smile
yet
when
he
saw
that
rare
look
in
her
face
his
heart
sank
suddenly
instead
of
swelling
and
standing
still
with
happiness
and
when
she
saw
how
sad
he
was
she
was
grave
with
the
instant
longing
to
feel
whatever
he
felt
of
pain
or
sorrow
that
is
one
of
the
truest
signs
of
love
but
zorzi
had
not
learned
much
of
love
yet
and
did
not
understand
what
is
it
she
asked
almost
tenderly
he
turned
his
eyes
from
her
and
rested
one
hand
against
the
trunk
of
the
i
do
not
understand
he
said
slowly
why
are
you
so
sad
what
is
it
that
is
always
making
you
suffer
how
could
i
tell
you
the
words
were
spoken
almost
under
his
breath
it
would
be
very
easy
to
tell
me
she
said
perhaps
i
could
help
you
oh
no
no
no
he
cried
with
an
accent
of
real
pain
you
could
not
help
me
who
knows
perhaps
i
am
the
best
friend
you
have
in
the
world
zorzi
indeed
i
believe
you
are
no
one
has
ever
been
so
good
to
me
and
you
have
not
many
friends
continued
marietta
the
workmen
are
jealous
of
you
because
you
are
always
with
my
father
my
brothers
do
not
like
you
for
the
same
reason
and
they
think
that
you
will
get
my
father
secret
from
him
some
day
and
outdo
them
all
no
you
have
not
many
friends
i
have
none
but
you
and
the
master
the
men
would
kill
me
if
they
dared
marietta
started
a
little
remembering
how
the
workmen
had
looked
at
him
in
the
morning
when
he
came
out
you
need
not
be
afraid
he
added
seeing
her
movement
they
will
not
touch
me
does
my
father
know
what
your
trouble
is
asked
marietta
suddenly
no
that
is
i
have
no
trouble
i
assure
you
i
am
of
a
melancholy
nature
i
am
glad
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
secrets
said
the
young
girl
quietly
ignoring
the
last
part
of
his
speech
if
it
had
i
could
not
help
you
at
all
could
i
that
morning
it
had
seemed
an
easy
thing
to
wait
even
two
years
before
giving
him
a
sign
before
dropping
in
his
path
the
rose
which
she
would
not
ask
of
him
again
the
minutes
seemed
years
now
for
she
knew
well
enough
what
his
trouble
was
since
yesterday
he
loved
her
and
he
thought
it
infinitely
impossible
in
his
modesty
that
she
should
ever
stoop
to
him
after
she
had
spoken
she
looked
at
him
with
eyes
for
a
while
but
he
stared
stonily
at
the
trunk
of
the
tree
beside
his
hand
gradually
as
she
gazed
her
lids
opened
wider
and
the
morning
sunlight
sparkled
in
the
deep
blue
and
her
fresh
lips
parted
before
she
was
aware
of
it
he
was
looking
at
her
with
a
strange
expression
she
had
never
seen
then
she
faintly
blushed
and
looked
down
at
her
beads
once
more
she
felt
as
if
she
had
told
him
that
she
loved
him
but
he
had
not
understood
he
had
only
seen
the
transfiguration
of
her
face
and
it
had
been
for
a
moment
as
he
had
never
seen
it
before
again
his
heart
sank
suddenly
and
he
uttered
a
little
sound
that
was
more
than
a
sigh
and
less
than
a
groan
there
are
remedies
for
almost
every
kind
of
pain
said
marietta
wisely
as
she
threaded
several
beads
give
me
one
for
mine
he
cried
almost
bitterly
bid
that
which
is
to
cease
from
being
and
that
to
be
which
is
not
earthly
possible
turn
the
world
back
and
undo
truth
and
make
it
all
a
dream
then
i
shall
find
the
remedy
and
forget
that
it
was
needed
there
are
magicians
who
pretend
to
do
such
things
she
answered
softly
i
would
there
were
he
sighed
but
those
who
come
to
them
for
help
tell
all
else
the
magician
has
no
power
would
you
call
a
physician
if
you
were
ill
and
tell
him
that
the
pain
you
felt
was
in
your
head
if
it
was
really
in
your
heart
she
had
paused
an
instant
before
speaking
the
last
words
and
they
came
with
a
little
effort
how
could
the
physician
cure
you
if
you
would
not
tell
him
the
truth
she
asked
as
he
said
nothing
how
can
the
wizard
work
miracles
for
you
unless
he
knows
what
miracle
you
ask
how
can
your
best
friend
help
you
if
if
she
does
not
know
what
help
you
need
still
he
was
silent
leaning
against
the
tree
with
bent
head
the
pain
was
growing
worse
and
harder
to
bear
she
spoke
so
softly
and
kindly
that
it
would
have
been
easy
to
tell
her
the
truth
he
thought
for
though
she
could
never
love
him
she
would
understand
and
would
forgive
him
he
had
not
dreamed
that
friendship
could
be
so
kind
am
i
right
she
asked
after
a
pause
yes
he
answered
when
i
can
not
bear
it
any
longer
i
will
tell
you
and
you
will
help
me
why
not
now
the
little
question
might
have
been
ruinous
to
all
his
resolution
if
zorzi
had
not
been
almost
like
a
child
in
his
simplicity
or
like
a
saint
in
his
determination
to
be
loyal
for
he
thought
it
loyalty
to
be
silent
not
only
for
the
sake
of
the
promise
he
had
given
in
return
for
his
life
but
in
respect
of
his
master
also
who
put
such
great
trust
in
him
pray
do
not
press
me
with
the
question
he
said
you
tempt
me
very
much
and
i
do
not
wish
to
speak
of
what
i
feel
be
my
friend
in
real
truth
if
you
can
and
do
not
ask
me
to
say
what
i
shall
ever
after
wish
unsaid
that
will
be
the
best
friendship
marietta
looked
across
the
garden
thoughtfully
and
suddenly
a
chilling
doubt
fell
upon
her
heart
she
could
not
have
been
mistaken
yesterday
she
could
not
be
deceived
in
him
now
and
yet
if
he
loved
her
as
she
believed
she
had
said
all
that
a
maiden
could
to
show
him
that
she
would
listen
willingly
she
had
said
too
much
and
she
felt
ashamed
and
hurt
almost
resentful
he
was
not
a
boy
if
he
loved
her
he
could
find
words
to
tell
her
so
and
should
have
found
them
for
she
had
helped
him
to
her
utmost
suddenly
she
almost
hated
him
for
what
his
silence
made
her
feel
and
she
told
herself
that
she
was
glad
he
had
not
dared
to
speak
for
she
did
not
love
him
at
all
it
was
all
a
sickening
mistake
it
was
all
a
miserable
little
dream
she
wished
that
he
would
go
away
and
leave
her
to
herself
not
that
she
should
shed
a
single
tear
she
was
far
too
angry
for
that
but
his
presence
so
near
her
reminded
her
of
what
she
had
done
he
must
have
seen
all
through
their
talk
that
she
was
trying
to
make
him
tell
his
love
and
there
was
nothing
to
tell
of
course
he
would
despise
her
that
was
natural
but
she
had
a
right
to
hate
him
for
it
and
she
would
with
all
her
heart
her
thoughts
all
came
together
in
a
tumult
of
disgust
and
resentment
if
zorzi
did
not
go
away
presently
she
would
go
away
herself
she
was
almost
resolved
to
get
up
and
leave
the
garden
when
the
door
opened
zorzi
it
was
beroviero
voice
aristarchi
already
stood
in
the
doorway
taking
leave
of
beroviero
with
many
oily
protestations
of
satisfaction
in
having
made
his
acquaintance
zorzi
went
forward
to
accompany
the
greek
to
the
door
i
shall
never
forget
that
i
have
had
the
honour
of
being
received
by
the
great
artist
himself
said
aristarchi
who
held
his
big
cap
in
his
hand
and
was
bowing
low
on
the
threshold
the
pleasure
has
been
all
on
my
side
returned
beroviero
courteously
on
the
contrary
quite
on
the
contrary
protested
his
guest
backing
away
and
then
turning
to
go
zorzi
walked
beside
him
on
his
left
as
they
reached
the
entrance
to
the
corridor
aristarchi
turned
once
more
and
made
an
elaborate
bow
sweeping
the
ground
with
his
cap
for
beroviero
had
remained
at
the
door
till
he
should
be
out
of
sight
he
bent
his
head
making
a
gracious
gesture
with
his
hand
and
went
in
as
the
greek
disappeared
zorzi
followed
the
latter
showing
him
out
marietta
saw
the
door
close
after
her
father
and
she
knew
that
zorzi
must
come
back
through
the
garden
in
a
few
moments
she
bent
her
head
over
her
beads
as
she
heard
his
step
and
pretended
not
to
see
him
when
he
came
near
her
he
stood
still
a
moment
but
she
would
not
look
up
and
between
annoyance
and
disappointment
and
confusion
she
felt
that
she
was
blushing
which
she
would
not
have
had
zorzi
see
for
anything
she
wondered
why
he
did
not
go
on
have
i
offended
you
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
oddly
enough
her
embarrassment
disappeared
as
soon
as
he
spoke
and
the
blush
faded
away
no
she
answered
coldly
enough
i
am
not
angry
i
am
only
sorry
but
i
am
glad
that
i
would
not
answer
your
question
returned
zorzi
i
doubt
whether
you
had
any
answer
to
give
retorted
marietta
with
a
touch
of
scorn
zorzi
brows
contracted
sharply
and
he
made
a
movement
to
go
on
so
her
proffered
friendship
was
worth
no
more
than
that
he
thought
she
was
angry
and
scornful
because
her
curiosity
was
disappointed
she
could
not
have
guessed
his
secret
he
was
sure
though
that
might
account
for
her
temper
for
she
would
of
course
be
angry
if
she
knew
that
he
loved
her
and
she
was
angry
now
because
he
had
refused
to
tell
her
so
that
was
a
woman
logic
he
thought
quite
regardless
of
the
defect
in
his
own
it
was
just
like
a
woman
he
sincerely
wished
that
he
might
tell
her
so
in
the
presence
of
marietta
the
man
who
had
confronted
sudden
death
less
than
hours
ago
with
a
coolness
that
had
seemed
imposing
to
other
men
was
little
better
than
a
girl
himself
he
turned
to
go
on
without
saying
more
but
she
stopped
him
i
am
sorry
that
you
do
not
care
for
my
friendship
she
said
in
a
hurt
tone
she
could
not
have
said
anything
which
he
would
have
found
it
harder
to
answer
just
then
what
makes
you
think
that
he
asked
hoping
to
gain
time
many
things
it
is
quite
true
so
it
does
not
matter
what
makes
me
think
it
she
tried
to
laugh
scornfully
but
there
was
a
quaver
in
her
voice
which
she
herself
had
not
expected
and
was
very
far
from
understanding
why
should
she
suddenly
feel
that
she
was
going
to
cry
it
had
seemed
so
ridiculous
in
poor
nella
that
morning
yet
there
was
a
most
unmistakable
something
in
her
throat
which
frightened
her
it
would
be
dreadful
if
she
should
burst
into
tears
over
her
beads
before
zorzi
eyes
she
tried
to
gulp
the
something
down
and
suddenly
as
she
bent
over
the
basket
she
saw
the
beautiful
hateful
drops
falling
fast
upon
the
little
dry
glass
things
and
even
then
in
her
shame
at
being
seen
she
wondered
why
the
beads
looked
bigger
through
the
glistening
tears
she
remembered
afterwards
how
they
looked
so
she
must
have
noticed
them
at
the
time
zorzi
knew
too
little
of
women
to
have
any
idea
of
what
he
ought
to
do
under
the
circumstances
he
did
not
know
whether
to
turn
his
back
or
to
go
away
so
he
stood
still
and
looked
at
her
which
was
the
very
worst
thing
he
could
have
done
worse
still
he
tried
to
reason
with
her
i
assure
you
that
you
are
mistaken
he
said
in
a
soothing
tone
i
wish
for
your
friendship
with
all
my
heart
only
when
you
ask
me
oh
go
away
for
heaven
sake
go
away
cried
marietta
almost
choking
and
turning
her
face
quite
away
so
that
he
could
only
see
the
back
of
her
head
at
the
same
time
she
tapped
the
ground
impatiently
with
her
foot
and
to
make
matters
worse
the
little
basket
of
beads
began
to
slip
off
her
knees
at
the
same
moment
she
caught
at
it
desperately
trying
not
to
look
round
and
half
blinded
by
her
tears
but
she
missed
it
and
but
for
zorzi
it
would
have
fallen
he
put
it
into
her
hands
very
gently
but
she
was
not
in
the
least
grateful
oh
please
go
away
she
repeated
can
you
not
understand
he
did
not
understand
but
he
obeyed
her
and
turned
away
very
grave
very
much
puzzled
by
this
new
development
of
affairs
and
sincerely
wishing
that
some
wise
familiar
spirit
would
whisper
the
explanation
in
his
ear
since
he
could
not
possibly
consult
any
living
person
she
heard
him
go
and
she
listened
for
the
shutting
of
the
laboratory
door
then
she
knew
that
she
was
quite
alone
in
the
garden
and
she
let
the
tears
flow
as
they
would
bending
her
head
till
it
touched
the
trunk
of
the
tree
and
they
wet
the
smooth
bark
and
ran
down
to
the
dry
earth
zorzi
went
in
and
began
to
tend
the
fire
as
usual
until
it
should
please
the
master
to
give
him
other
orders
old
beroviero
was
sitting
in
the
big
chair
in
which
he
sometimes
rested
himself
his
elbow
on
one
of
its
arms
and
his
hand
grasping
his
beard
below
his
chin
zorzi
he
said
at
last
i
have
seen
that
man
before
zorzi
looked
at
him
expecting
more
but
for
some
time
beroviero
said
nothing
the
young
man
selected
his
pieces
of
beech
wood
laying
them
ready
before
the
little
opening
just
above
the
floor
it
is
very
strange
said
beroviero
at
last
he
seems
to
be
a
rich
merchant
now
but
i
am
almost
quite
sure
that
i
saw
him
in
naples
did
you
know
him
there
sir
asked
zorzi
no
answered
his
master
thoughtfully
i
saw
him
in
a
cart
with
his
hands
tied
behind
him
on
his
way
to
be
hanged
he
looks
as
if
one
hanging
would
not
be
enough
for
him
observed
zorzi
beroviero
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
laughed
and
he
laughed
very
rarely
yes
he
said
it
is
not
a
face
one
could
forget
easily
he
added
then
he
rose
and
went
back
to
his
table
chapter
vii
the
sun
was
high
over
venice
gleaming
on
the
blue
lagoons
that
lightly
rippled
under
a
southerly
breeze
filling
the
vast
square
of
saint
mark
with
blinding
light
casting
deep
shadows
behind
the
church
and
in
the
narrow
alleys
and
canals
to
northward
about
the
merceria
the
morning
haze
had
long
since
blown
away
and
the
outlines
of
the
old
church
and
monastery
on
saint
george
island
and
of
the
buildings
on
the
guidecca
and
on
the
lido
were
hard
and
clear
against
the
cloudless
sky
mere
designs
cut
out
in
rich
colours
as
if
with
a
sharp
knife
and
reared
up
against
a
background
of
violent
light
in
venice
only
the
melancholy
drenching
rain
of
a
winter
day
brings
rest
to
the
eye
when
water
meets
water
and
sky
is
washed
into
sea
and
the
city
lies
soaking
and
dripping
between
two
floods
but
soon
the
wind
shifts
to
the
northeast
out
breaks
the
sun
again
and
all
venice
is
instantly
in
a
glare
of
light
and
colour
and
startling
distinctness
like
the
sails
and
rigging
of
a
ship
at
sea
on
a
clear
day
it
was
sunday
morning
and
high
mass
was
over
in
saint
mark
the
crowd
had
streamed
out
of
the
central
door
spreading
like
a
bright
fan
over
the
square
the
men
in
gay
costumes
red
green
blue
yellow
purple
brown
and
white
their
legs
particoloured
in
halves
and
quarters
so
that
when
looking
at
a
group
it
was
mere
guesswork
to
match
the
pair
that
belonged
to
one
man
women
in
dresses
of
one
tone
mostly
rich
and
dark
and
often
heavily
embroidered
for
no
sumptuary
laws
could
effectually
limit
outward
display
and
the
insolent
vanity
of
an
age
still
almost
mediaeval
made
it
natural
that
the
rich
should
attire
themselves
as
richly
as
they
could
and
that
the
poor
should
be
despised
for
wearing
poor
clothes
angelo
beroviero
had
a
true
venetian
taste
for
splendour
but
he
was
also
deeply
imbued
with
the
venetian
love
of
secrecy
in
all
matters
that
concerned
his
private
life
when
he
bade
marietta
accompany
him
to
venice
on
that
sunday
morning
he
was
equally
anxious
that
she
should
be
as
finely
dressed
as
was
becoming
for
the
daughter
of
a
wealthy
citizen
and
that
she
should
be
in
ignorance
of
the
object
of
the
trip
she
was
not
to
know
that
jacopo
contarini
would
be
standing
beside
the
second
column
on
the
left
watching
her
with
lazily
critical
eyes
she
was
merely
told
that
she
and
her
father
were
to
dine
in
the
house
of
a
certain
messer
luigi
foscarini
procurator
of
saint
mark
who
was
an
old
and
valued
friend
though
a
near
connection
of
alvise
trevisan
a
rival
of
murano
all
this
had
been
carefully
planned
in
order
that
during
their
absence
beroviero
house
might
be
suitably
prepared
for
the
solemn
family
meeting
which
was
to
take
place
late
in
the
afternoon
and
at
which
her
betrothal
was
to
be
announced
but
of
which
marietta
knew
nothing
her
father
counted
upon
surprising
her
and
perhaps
dazzling
her
so
as
to
avoid
all
discussion
and
all
possibility
of
resistance
on
her
part
she
should
see
contarini
in
the
church
and
while
still
under
the
first
impression
of
his
beauty
and
magnificence
she
should
be
told
before
her
assembled
family
that
she
was
solemnly
bound
to
marry
him
in
two
months
time
beroviero
never
expected
opposition
in
anything
he
wished
to
do
but
he
had
always
heard
that
young
girls
could
find
a
thousand
reasons
for
not
marrying
the
man
their
parents
chose
for
them
and
he
believed
that
he
could
make
all
argument
and
hesitation
impossible
marietta
doubtless
expected
to
have
a
week
in
which
to
make
up
her
mind
she
should
have
five
hours
and
even
that
was
too
much
thought
beroviero
he
would
have
preferred
to
march
her
to
the
altar
without
any
preliminaries
and
marry
her
to
contarini
without
giving
her
a
chance
of
seeing
him
before
the
ceremony
after
all
that
was
the
custom
of
the
day
the
fortunes
of
love
were
in
his
favour
for
marietta
had
spent
three
miserably
unhappy
days
and
nights
since
she
had
last
talked
with
zorzi
in
the
garden
from
that
time
he
had
avoided
her
moat
carefully
never
coming
out
of
the
laboratory
when
she
was
under
the
tree
with
her
work
never
raising
his
eyes
to
look
at
her
when
she
came
in
and
talked
with
her
father
when
she
entered
the
big
room
he
made
a
solemn
bow
and
occupied
himself
in
the
farthest
corner
so
long
as
she
remained
there
is
a
stage
in
which
even
the
truest
and
purest
love
of
boy
and
maiden
feeds
on
misunderstandings
in
a
burst
of
tears
and
ashamed
that
she
should
be
seen
crying
marietta
had
bidden
him
go
away
in
the
folly
of
his
young
heart
he
took
her
at
her
word
and
avoided
her
consistently
he
had
been
hurt
by
the
words
but
by
a
kind
of
unconscious
selfishness
his
pain
helped
him
to
do
what
he
believed
to
be
his
duty
and
marietta
forgot
that
he
had
picked
up
the
rose
dropped
by
her
in
the
path
she
forgot
that
she
had
seen
him
stand
gazing
up
at
her
window
with
a
look
that
could
mean
only
love
she
forgot
how
tenderly
and
softly
he
had
answered
her
in
the
garden
she
only
remembered
that
she
had
done
her
utmost
and
too
much
to
make
him
tell
her
that
he
loved
her
and
in
vain
she
could
not
forgive
him
that
for
even
after
three
days
her
cheeks
burned
fiercely
whenever
she
thought
of
it
after
that
it
mattered
nothing
what
became
of
her
whether
she
were
betrothed
or
whether
she
were
married
or
whether
she
went
mad
or
even
whether
she
died
that
would
be
the
best
of
all
in
this
mood
marietta
entered
the
gondola
and
seated
herself
by
her
father
on
sunday
morning
she
wore
an
embroidered
gown
of
olive
green
a
little
open
at
her
dazzling
throat
and
a
silk
mantle
of
a
darker
tone
hung
from
her
shoulders
to
protect
her
from
the
sun
rather
than
from
the
air
her
russet
hair
was
plaited
in
a
thick
flat
braid
and
brought
round
her
head
like
a
broad
coronet
of
red
gold
and
a
point
lace
veil
pinned
upon
it
with
stoat
gold
pins
hang
down
behind
and
was
brought
forward
carelessly
upon
one
shoulder
beside
her
angelo
beroviero
was
splendid
in
dark
red
cloth
and
purple
silk
he
was
proud
of
his
daughter
who
was
betrothed
to
the
heir
of
a
great
venetian
house
he
was
proud
of
his
own
achievements
of
his
wealth
of
the
richly
furnished
gondola
of
his
two
big
young
oarsmen
in
quartered
yellow
and
blue
hose
and
snowy
shirts
and
of
his
liveried
man
in
blue
and
gold
who
sat
outside
the
low
on
a
little
stool
staff
in
hand
ready
to
attend
upon
his
master
and
young
mistress
whenever
they
should
please
to
go
on
foot
marietta
had
got
into
the
gondola
without
so
much
as
glancing
across
the
canal
to
see
whether
zorzi
were
standing
there
to
see
them
push
off
as
he
often
did
when
she
and
her
father
went
out
together
if
he
were
there
she
meant
to
show
him
that
she
could
be
more
indifferent
than
he
if
he
were
not
she
would
show
herself
that
she
did
not
care
enough
even
to
look
for
him
but
when
the
gondola
was
out
of
sight
of
the
house
she
wished
she
knew
whether
he
had
looked
out
or
not
her
father
had
told
her
that
they
were
going
to
dine
with
the
procurator
foscarini
and
his
wife
the
pair
had
one
daughter
of
marietta
age
and
she
was
a
cripple
from
birth
marietta
was
fond
of
her
and
it
was
a
relief
to
get
away
from
murano
even
for
half
a
day
the
visit
explained
well
enough
why
her
father
had
desired
her
to
put
on
her
best
gown
and
most
valuable
lace
she
really
had
not
the
slightest
idea
that
anything
more
important
was
on
foot
beroviero
looked
at
her
in
silence
as
they
sped
along
with
the
gently
rocking
motion
of
the
gondola
which
is
not
exactly
like
any
other
movement
in
the
world
he
had
already
noticed
that
she
was
paler
than
usual
but
the
extraordinary
whiteness
of
her
skin
made
her
pallor
becoming
to
her
and
it
was
set
off
by
the
colour
of
her
hair
as
ivory
by
rough
gold
he
wondered
whether
she
had
guessed
whither
he
was
taking
her
it
is
a
long
time
since
we
were
in
saint
mark
together
he
said
at
last
it
must
be
more
than
a
year
answered
marietta
we
pass
it
often
but
we
hardly
ever
go
in
it
is
early
observed
beroviero
speaking
as
indifferently
as
he
could
when
we
left
home
it
lacked
an
hour
and
a
half
of
noon
by
the
dial
shall
we
go
into
the
church
for
a
while
if
you
like
replied
marietta
mechanically
nothing
made
much
difference
that
morning
but
she
knew
that
the
high
mass
would
be
over
and
that
the
church
would
be
quiet
and
cool
it
was
not
at
that
time
the
cathedral
of
venice
though
it
had
always
been
the
church
in
which
the
doges
worshipped
in
state
they
landed
at
the
low
steps
in
the
rio
del
palazzo
and
the
servant
held
out
his
bent
elbow
for
marietta
to
steady
herself
though
he
knew
that
she
would
not
touch
it
for
she
was
light
and
as
a
fawn
but
beroviero
leaned
heavily
on
his
man
arm
they
came
round
the
patriarch
palace
into
the
open
square
whence
the
crowd
had
nearly
all
disappeared
dispersing
in
different
directions
just
as
they
were
within
sight
of
the
great
doors
of
the
church
beroviero
saw
a
very
tall
man
in
a
purple
silk
mantle
going
in
alone
it
was
contarini
and
beroviero
drew
a
little
sigh
of
relief
the
intended
bridegroom
was
punctual
but
beroviero
thought
that
he
might
have
shown
such
anxiety
to
see
his
bride
as
should
have
brought
him
to
the
door
a
few
minutes
before
the
time
marietta
had
drawn
her
veil
across
her
face
leaving
only
her
eyes
uncovered
according
to
custom
it
is
hot
she
complained
it
will
be
cool
in
the
church
answered
her
father
throw
your
veil
back
my
dear
there
is
no
one
to
see
you
there
is
the
sun
she
said
for
she
had
been
taught
that
one
of
a
venetian
lady
chief
beauties
is
her
complexion
well
well
there
will
be
no
sun
in
the
church
and
the
old
man
hurried
her
in
without
bestowing
a
glance
upon
the
bronze
horses
over
the
door
to
admire
which
he
generally
stopped
a
few
moments
in
passing
they
entered
the
great
church
and
the
servant
went
before
them
dipped
his
fingers
in
the
basin
and
offered
them
holy
water
they
crossed
themselves
and
marietta
bent
one
knee
looking
towards
the
high
altar
a
score
of
people
were
scattered
about
kneeling
and
standing
in
the
nave
contarini
was
leaning
against
the
second
pillar
on
the
left
and
had
been
watching
the
door
when
marietta
and
her
father
entered
beroviero
saw
him
at
once
but
led
his
daughter
up
the
opposite
side
of
the
nave
knelt
down
beside
her
a
moment
at
the
screen
then
crossed
and
came
down
the
aisle
and
at
last
turned
into
the
nave
again
by
the
second
pillar
so
as
to
come
upon
contarini
as
it
were
unawares
this
all
seemed
necessary
to
him
in
order
that
marietta
should
receive
a
very
strong
and
sudden
impression
which
should
leave
no
doubt
in
her
mind
contarini
himself
was
too
thoroughly
venetian
not
to
understand
what
beroviero
was
doing
and
when
the
two
came
upon
him
he
was
drawn
up
to
his
full
height
one
gloved
hand
holding
his
cap
and
resting
on
his
hip
the
other
gloveless
and
white
as
a
woman
was
twisting
his
silky
mustache
beroviero
had
manoeuvred
so
cleverly
that
marietta
almost
jostled
the
young
patrician
as
she
turned
the
pillar
contarini
drew
back
with
quick
grace
and
a
slight
inclination
of
his
body
and
then
pretended
the
utmost
surprise
on
seeing
his
valued
friend
messer
angelo
beroviero
my
most
dear
sir
he
exclaimed
this
is
indeed
good
fortune
mine
messer
jacopo
returned
beroviero
with
equally
astonishment
marietta
had
looked
contarini
full
in
the
face
before
she
had
time
to
draw
her
veil
across
her
own
she
stepped
back
and
placed
herself
behind
her
father
protected
as
it
were
by
their
who
stood
beside
her
with
his
staff
she
understood
instantly
that
the
magnificent
patrician
was
the
man
of
whom
her
father
had
spoken
as
her
future
husband
seen
as
she
had
seen
him
in
the
glowing
church
in
the
most
splendid
surroundings
that
could
be
imagined
he
was
certainly
a
man
at
whom
any
woman
would
look
twice
even
out
of
curiosity
and
through
her
veil
marietta
looked
again
till
she
saw
his
soft
brown
eyes
scrutinising
her
appearance
then
she
turned
quickly
away
for
she
had
looked
long
enough
she
saw
that
a
woman
in
black
was
kneeling
by
the
next
pillar
watching
her
intently
with
a
sort
of
cold
stare
that
almost
made
her
shudder
yet
the
woman
was
exceedingly
beautiful
it
was
easy
to
see
that
though
the
dark
veil
hid
half
her
face
and
its
folds
concealed
most
of
her
figure
the
mysterious
eyes
were
those
of
another
race
the
marble
cheek
was
more
perfectly
modelled
and
turned
than
an
italian
the
curling
golden
hair
was
more
glorious
than
any
venetian
arisa
had
come
to
see
her
master
bride
and
he
knew
that
she
was
there
looking
on
why
should
he
care
it
was
a
bargain
and
he
was
not
going
to
give
up
arisa
and
the
house
of
the
agnus
dei
because
he
meant
to
marry
the
rich
daughter
marietta
imagined
no
connection
between
the
woman
and
the
man
who
thus
insolently
came
to
the
same
place
to
look
at
her
pretending
not
to
know
one
another
and
when
she
looked
back
at
contarini
she
felt
a
miserable
little
thrill
of
vanity
as
she
noticed
that
he
was
looking
fixedly
at
her
and
that
his
eyes
did
not
wander
to
the
face
of
that
other
woman
who
was
so
much
more
beautiful
than
herself
perhaps
after
all
he
would
really
prefer
her
to
that
matchless
creature
close
beside
her
nothing
mattered
of
course
since
zorzi
did
not
love
her
but
after
all
it
was
flattering
to
be
admired
by
jacopo
contarini
who
could
choose
his
wife
where
he
pleased
through
the
whole
world
it
all
happened
in
a
few
seconds
the
two
men
exchanged
a
few
words
to
which
she
paid
no
attention
and
took
leave
of
each
other
with
great
ceremony
and
much
bowing
on
both
sides
when
her
father
turned
at
last
marietta
was
already
walking
towards
the
door
the
servant
by
her
left
side
beroviero
had
scarcely
joined
her
when
she
started
a
little
and
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
the
greek
merchant
she
whispered
beroviero
looked
where
she
was
looking
by
the
first
pillar
gazing
intently
at
arisa
kneeling
figure
stood
aristarchi
his
hands
folded
over
his
broad
chest
his
shaggy
head
bent
forward
his
sturdy
legs
a
little
apart
he
too
had
come
to
see
the
promised
bride
and
to
be
a
witness
of
the
bargain
whereby
he
also
was
to
be
enriched
as
marietta
came
out
of
the
church
she
covered
her
face
closely
and
drew
her
silk
mantle
quite
round
her
bending
her
head
a
little
the
servant
walked
a
few
paces
in
front
you
have
seen
your
future
husband
my
child
said
beroviero
i
suppose
that
the
young
noble
was
messer
jacopo
contarini
answered
marietta
coldly
you
are
hard
to
please
if
you
are
not
satisfied
with
my
choice
for
you
observed
her
father
to
this
marietta
said
nothing
she
only
bent
her
head
a
little
lower
looking
down
as
she
trod
delicately
over
the
hot
and
dusty
ground
and
you
are
a
most
ungrateful
daughter
continued
beroviero
if
you
do
not
appreciate
my
kindness
and
liberality
of
mind
in
allowing
you
to
see
him
before
you
are
formally
betrothed
perhaps
he
is
even
more
pleased
by
your
liberality
of
mind
than
i
could
possibly
be
retorted
the
young
girl
with
unbending
coldness
he
has
probably
not
seen
many
venetian
girls
of
our
class
face
to
face
and
unveiled
he
is
to
be
congratulated
on
his
good
fortune
by
my
faith
exclaimed
beroviero
it
is
hard
to
satisfy
you
i
have
asked
nothing
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
any
objections
to
allege
against
such
a
marriage
have
i
said
that
i
should
oppose
it
one
may
obey
without
enthusiasm
she
laughed
coldly
like
the
unprofitable
servant
i
had
expected
something
more
of
you
my
child
i
have
been
at
infinite
pains
and
i
am
making
great
sacrifices
to
procure
you
a
suitable
husband
and
there
are
scores
of
noble
girls
in
venice
who
would
give
ten
years
of
their
lives
to
marry
jacopo
contarini
and
you
say
that
you
obey
my
commands
without
enthusiasm
you
are
an
ungrateful
no
i
am
not
interrupted
marietta
firmly
i
would
rather
not
marry
at
all
not
marry
repeated
beroviero
interrupting
her
in
a
tone
of
profound
stupefaction
and
standing
still
in
the
sun
as
he
spoke
why
what
is
the
matter
is
it
so
strange
that
i
should
be
contented
with
my
girl
life
asked
marietta
should
i
not
be
ungrateful
indeed
if
i
wished
to
leave
you
and
become
the
wife
of
a
man
i
have
just
seen
for
the
first
time
you
use
most
extraordinary
arguments
my
dear
replied
beroviero
quite
at
a
loss
for
a
suitable
retort
of
course
i
have
done
my
best
to
make
you
happy
he
paused
for
she
had
placed
him
in
the
awkward
position
of
being
angry
because
she
did
not
wish
to
leave
him
i
really
do
not
know
what
to
say
he
added
after
a
reflection
perhaps
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
answered
marietta
in
a
tone
of
irritating
superiority
for
she
certainly
had
the
best
of
the
discussion
they
had
reached
the
gondola
by
this
time
and
as
the
servant
sat
within
hearing
at
the
open
door
of
the
they
could
not
continue
talking
about
such
a
matter
beroviero
was
glad
of
it
for
he
regarded
the
affair
as
settled
and
considered
that
it
should
be
hastened
to
its
conclusion
without
any
further
reasoning
about
it
if
he
had
sent
word
to
young
contarini
that
the
answer
should
be
given
him
in
a
week
that
was
merely
an
imaginary
formality
invented
to
cover
his
own
dignity
since
he
had
so
far
derogated
from
it
as
to
allow
the
young
man
to
see
marietta
in
reality
the
marriage
had
been
determined
and
settled
between
beroviero
and
contarini
father
before
anything
had
been
said
to
either
of
the
young
people
the
meeting
in
the
church
might
have
been
dispensed
with
if
the
patrician
had
been
able
to
answer
with
certainty
for
his
wild
son
conduct
jacopo
had
demanded
it
and
his
father
was
so
anxious
for
the
marriage
that
he
had
communicated
the
request
to
beroviero
the
latter
always
for
his
dignity
sake
had
pretended
to
refuse
and
had
then
secretly
arranged
the
matter
for
jacopo
as
has
been
seen
without
old
contarini
knowledge
marietta
leaned
back
under
the
cool
dark
and
her
hands
lay
idly
in
her
lap
she
felt
that
she
was
helpless
because
she
was
indifferent
and
that
she
could
even
now
have
changed
the
course
of
her
destiny
if
she
had
cared
to
make
the
effort
there
was
no
reason
for
making
any
she
did
not
believe
that
she
had
really
loved
zorzi
after
all
and
if
she
had
it
seemed
quite
impossible
that
she
should
ever
have
married
him
he
was
nothing
but
a
waif
a
servant
a
stranger
predestined
to
a
poor
and
obscure
life
as
she
inwardly
repeated
some
of
these
considerations
she
felt
a
little
thrust
of
remorse
for
trying
to
look
down
on
him
as
impossibly
far
below
her
own
station
and
a
small
voice
told
her
that
he
was
an
artist
and
that
if
he
had
chanced
to
be
born
in
venice
he
would
have
been
as
good
as
her
brothers
the
future
stretched
out
before
her
in
a
sort
of
dull
magnificence
that
did
not
in
the
least
appeal
to
her
simple
nature
she
could
not
tell
why
she
had
despised
jacopo
contarini
from
the
moment
she
looked
into
his
beautiful
eyes
happily
women
are
not
expected
to
explain
why
they
sometimes
judge
rightly
at
first
sight
when
a
wise
man
is
absurdly
deceived
marietta
did
not
understand
jacopo
and
she
easily
fancied
that
because
her
own
character
was
the
stronger
she
should
rule
him
as
easily
as
she
managed
nella
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
he
was
already
under
the
domination
of
another
woman
who
might
prove
to
be
quite
as
strong
as
she
what
she
saw
was
the
weakness
in
his
eyes
and
mouth
with
such
a
man
she
thought
there
was
little
to
fear
but
there
was
nothing
to
love
if
she
asked
he
would
give
if
she
opposed
him
he
would
surrender
if
she
lost
her
temper
and
commanded
he
would
obey
with
petulant
docility
she
should
be
obliged
to
take
refuge
in
vanity
in
order
to
get
any
satisfaction
out
of
her
life
and
she
was
not
naturally
vain
the
luxuries
of
those
days
were
familiar
to
her
from
her
childhood
though
she
had
not
lived
in
a
palace
she
had
been
brought
up
in
a
house
that
was
not
unlike
one
she
ate
off
silver
plates
and
drank
from
glasses
that
were
masterpieces
of
her
father
art
she
had
coffers
full
of
silks
and
satins
and
fine
linen
embroidered
with
gold
thread
there
was
always
gold
and
silver
in
her
little
when
she
wanted
anything
or
wished
to
give
to
the
poor
she
was
waited
on
by
a
maid
of
her
own
like
any
fine
lady
of
venice
and
there
were
a
score
of
idle
servants
in
a
house
where
there
were
only
two
masters
there
was
nothing
which
contarini
could
give
her
that
would
be
more
than
a
little
useless
exaggeration
of
what
she
had
already
she
had
no
particular
desire
to
show
herself
unveiled
to
the
world
as
married
women
did
and
she
was
not
especially
attracted
by
the
idea
of
becoming
one
of
them
she
had
been
brought
up
alone
she
had
acquired
tastes
which
other
women
had
not
and
which
would
no
longer
be
satisfied
in
her
married
life
she
loved
the
she
delighted
in
taking
a
herself
and
making
small
objects
which
she
decorated
as
she
pleased
she
felt
a
lively
interest
in
her
father
experiments
she
enjoyed
the
atmosphere
of
his
wisdom
though
it
was
occasionally
disturbed
by
the
foolish
little
storms
of
his
hot
temper
and
until
now
she
had
liked
to
be
often
with
zorzi
that
was
past
of
course
but
the
rest
remained
and
it
was
much
to
sacrifice
for
the
sake
of
becoming
a
contarini
and
living
on
the
grand
canal
with
a
man
she
should
always
despise
it
was
clearly
not
the
idea
of
marriage
that
surprised
or
repelled
her
not
even
of
a
marriage
with
a
man
she
did
not
know
and
had
seen
but
once
girls
were
brought
up
to
regard
marriage
as
the
greatest
thing
in
life
as
the
natural
goal
to
which
all
their
girlhood
should
tend
and
at
the
same
time
they
were
taught
from
childhood
that
it
was
all
to
be
arranged
for
them
and
that
they
would
in
due
course
grow
fond
of
the
man
their
parents
chose
for
them
until
marietta
had
begun
to
love
zorzi
she
had
accepted
all
these
things
quite
naturally
as
a
part
of
every
woman
life
and
it
would
have
seemed
as
absurd
and
perhaps
as
impossible
to
rebel
against
them
as
to
repudiate
the
religion
in
which
she
had
been
born
such
beliefs
turn
into
prejudices
and
assert
themselves
as
soon
as
whatever
momentarily
retards
them
is
removed
by
the
time
the
gondola
drew
alongside
of
the
steps
of
the
foscarini
palace
marietta
was
convinced
that
there
was
nothing
for
her
but
to
submit
to
her
fate
then
i
am
to
be
married
in
two
months
she
said
in
a
tone
of
interrogation
and
regardless
of
the
servant
beroviero
bent
his
head
in
answer
and
smiled
kindly
for
after
all
he
was
grateful
to
her
for
accepting
his
decision
so
quietly
but
marietta
was
very
pale
after
she
had
spoken
for
the
audible
words
somehow
made
it
all
seem
dreadfully
real
and
out
of
the
shadows
of
the
great
entrance
hall
that
opened
upon
the
canal
she
could
fancy
zorzi
face
looking
at
her
sadly
and
reproachfully
the
bargain
was
made
and
the
woman
he
loved
was
sold
for
life
for
one
moment
instinctive
womanhood
felt
the
accursed
humiliation
and
the
flushing
blood
rose
in
the
cool
cheeks
she
would
have
blushed
deeper
had
she
guessed
who
had
been
witnesses
of
her
first
meeting
with
contarini
and
old
beroviero
temper
would
have
broken
out
furiously
if
he
could
have
imagined
that
the
greek
pirate
who
had
somehow
miraculously
escaped
the
hangman
in
naples
had
been
contemplating
with
satisfaction
the
progress
of
the
marriage
negotiations
sure
that
he
himself
should
before
long
be
enjoying
the
better
part
of
marietta
rich
dowry
if
the
old
man
could
have
had
vision
of
jacopo
life
and
could
have
suddenly
known
what
the
beautiful
woman
in
black
was
to
the
patrician
contarini
chance
of
going
home
alive
that
day
would
have
been
small
indeed
for
beroviero
might
have
strangled
him
where
he
stood
and
perhaps
aristarchi
would
have
discreetly
turned
his
back
while
he
was
doing
it
for
a
few
minutes
they
had
all
been
very
near
together
the
deceivers
and
the
deceived
and
it
was
not
likely
that
they
should
ever
all
be
so
near
again
contarini
had
never
seen
the
greek
and
arisa
was
not
aware
that
he
was
in
the
church
when
beroviero
and
marietta
were
gone
jacopo
turned
his
back
on
the
slave
for
a
moment
as
if
he
meant
to
walk
further
up
the
church
aristarchi
watched
them
both
for
in
spite
of
all
he
did
not
quite
trust
the
georgian
woman
and
he
had
never
seen
her
alone
with
jacopo
when
she
was
unaware
of
his
own
presence
yet
he
was
afraid
to
go
nearer
now
lest
arisa
should
accidentally
see
him
and
betray
by
her
manner
that
she
knew
him
jacopo
turned
suddenly
when
he
judged
that
he
could
leave
the
church
without
overtaking
beroviero
and
he
walked
quietly
down
the
nave
he
passed
close
to
arisa
and
aristarchi
guessed
that
their
eyes
met
for
a
moment
he
almost
fancied
that
contarini
lips
moved
and
he
was
sure
that
he
smiled
but
that
was
all
and
arisa
remained
on
her
knees
not
even
turning
her
head
a
little
as
her
lover
went
by
not
so
ugly
after
all
contarini
had
said
under
his
breath
and
the
careless
smile
went
with
the
words
arisa
lip
curled
contemptuously
as
she
heard
she
had
drawn
back
her
veil
her
face
was
raised
as
if
she
were
sending
up
a
prayer
to
heaven
and
the
light
fell
full
upon
the
magnificent
whiteness
of
her
throat
that
showed
in
strong
relief
against
the
black
velvet
and
lace
she
needed
no
other
answer
to
what
he
said
but
in
the
scorn
of
her
curving
mouth
which
seemed
all
meant
for
marietta
there
was
contempt
for
him
too
that
would
have
cut
him
to
the
quick
of
his
vanity
aristarchi
walked
deliberately
by
the
pillar
to
the
aisle
as
he
passed
and
listened
for
the
flapping
of
the
heavy
leathern
curtain
at
the
door
then
he
stole
nearer
to
the
place
where
arisa
was
still
kneeling
and
came
noiselessly
behind
her
and
leaned
against
the
column
and
watched
her
not
caring
if
he
surprised
her
now
but
she
did
not
turn
round
listening
intently
aristarchi
heard
a
soft
quick
whispering
and
he
saw
that
it
was
punctuated
by
a
very
slight
occasional
movement
of
her
head
he
had
not
believed
her
when
she
had
told
him
that
she
said
her
prayers
at
night
but
she
was
undoubtedly
praying
now
and
aristarchi
watched
her
with
interest
as
he
might
have
looked
at
some
rare
foreign
animal
whose
habits
he
did
not
understand
she
was
very
intently
bent
on
what
she
was
saying
for
he
stayed
there
some
time
scarcely
breathing
before
he
turned
away
and
disappeared
in
the
shadows
with
noiseless
steps
chapter
viii
all
through
the
long
sunday
afternoon
zorzi
sat
in
the
laboratory
alone
from
time
to
time
he
tended
the
fire
which
must
not
be
allowed
to
go
down
lest
the
quality
of
the
glass
should
be
injured
or
at
least
changed
then
he
went
back
to
the
master
great
chair
and
allowed
himself
to
think
of
what
was
happening
in
the
house
opposite
in
those
days
there
was
no
formal
betrothal
before
marriage
at
which
the
intended
bride
and
bridegroom
joined
hands
or
exchanged
the
rings
which
were
to
be
again
exchanged
at
the
wedding
when
a
marriage
had
been
arranged
the
parents
or
guardians
of
the
young
couple
signed
the
contract
before
a
notary
a
strictly
commercial
and
legal
formality
and
the
two
families
then
announced
the
match
to
their
respective
relatives
who
were
invited
for
the
purpose
and
were
hospitably
entertained
the
announcement
was
final
and
to
break
off
a
marriage
after
it
had
been
announced
was
a
deadly
offence
and
was
generally
an
irreparable
injury
to
the
bride
in
beroviero
house
the
richest
carpets
were
taken
from
the
storerooms
and
spread
upon
the
pavement
and
the
stairs
tapestries
of
great
worth
and
beauty
were
hung
upon
the
walls
the
servants
were
arrayed
in
their
liveries
and
spoke
in
whispers
when
they
spoke
at
all
the
silver
dishes
were
piled
with
sweetmeats
and
early
fruits
and
the
silver
plates
had
been
not
only
scoured
but
had
been
polished
with
leather
which
was
not
done
every
day
in
all
the
rooms
that
were
opened
silken
curtains
had
been
hung
before
the
windows
in
place
of
those
used
at
other
times
in
a
word
the
house
had
been
prepared
in
a
few
hours
for
a
great
family
festivity
and
when
marietta
got
out
of
the
gondola
she
set
her
foot
upon
a
thick
carpet
that
covered
the
steps
and
was
even
allowed
to
hang
down
and
dip
itself
in
the
water
of
the
canal
by
way
of
showing
what
little
value
was
set
upon
it
by
the
rich
man
zorzi
had
known
that
the
preparations
were
going
forward
and
he
knew
what
they
meant
he
would
rather
see
nothing
of
them
and
when
the
guests
were
gone
old
beroviero
would
come
over
and
give
him
some
final
instructions
before
beginning
his
journey
until
then
he
could
be
alone
in
the
laboratory
where
only
the
low
roar
of
the
fire
in
the
furnace
broke
the
silence
marietta
head
was
aching
and
she
felt
as
if
the
hard
hot
fingers
of
some
evil
demon
were
pressing
her
eyeballs
down
into
their
sockets
she
sat
in
an
inner
chamber
to
which
only
women
were
admitted
there
she
sat
in
a
sort
of
state
a
circlet
of
gold
set
upon
her
loosened
hair
her
dress
all
of
embroidered
white
silk
her
shoulders
covered
with
a
wide
mantle
of
green
and
gold
brocade
that
fell
in
heavy
folds
to
the
floor
she
wore
many
jewels
too
such
as
she
would
not
have
worn
in
public
before
her
marriage
they
had
belonged
to
her
mother
like
the
mantle
and
were
now
brought
out
for
the
first
time
it
was
very
hot
but
the
windows
were
shut
lest
the
sound
of
the
good
ladies
voices
should
be
heard
without
for
the
news
that
marietta
was
to
be
married
had
suddenly
gone
abroad
through
murano
and
all
the
idlers
and
the
men
from
the
furnaces
where
no
work
was
done
on
sunday
as
well
as
all
the
poor
were
assembled
on
the
footway
and
the
bridge
and
in
the
narrow
alleys
round
the
house
they
all
pushed
and
jostled
each
other
to
see
beroviero
friends
and
relations
as
they
emerged
from
beneath
the
black
of
their
gondolas
to
enter
the
house
in
the
hall
the
guests
divided
and
the
men
gathered
in
a
large
lower
chamber
while
the
women
went
upstairs
to
offer
their
congratulations
to
marietta
with
many
set
compliments
upon
her
beauty
her
clothes
and
her
jewels
and
even
with
occasional
flattering
allusions
to
the
vast
dowry
her
husband
was
to
receive
with
her
she
listened
wearily
and
her
head
ached
more
and
more
so
that
she
longed
for
the
coolness
of
her
own
room
and
for
nella
soothing
chatter
to
which
she
was
so
much
accustomed
that
she
missed
it
if
the
little
brown
woman
chanced
to
be
silent
the
sun
went
down
and
wax
candles
were
brought
instead
of
the
tall
oil
lamps
that
were
used
on
ordinary
days
it
grew
hotter
and
hotter
the
compliments
of
the
ladies
seemed
more
and
more
dull
and
stale
her
mantle
was
heavy
and
even
the
gold
circlet
on
her
hair
was
a
burden
worse
than
all
she
knew
that
every
minute
was
carrying
her
further
and
further
into
the
dominion
of
the
irrevocable
whence
she
could
never
return
she
had
looked
at
the
palaces
she
had
passed
in
venice
that
morning
some
in
shadow
some
in
sunlight
some
with
gay
faces
and
some
grave
but
all
so
different
from
the
big
old
house
in
murano
that
she
did
not
wish
to
live
in
them
at
all
it
would
have
been
much
easier
to
submit
if
she
had
been
betrothed
to
a
foreigner
a
roman
or
a
florentine
she
had
been
told
that
romans
were
all
wicked
and
gloomy
and
that
florentines
were
all
wicked
and
gay
that
was
what
nella
had
heard
but
in
a
sense
they
were
free
for
they
probably
did
what
was
good
in
their
own
eyes
as
wicked
people
often
do
life
in
venice
was
to
be
lived
by
rule
and
everything
that
tasted
of
freedom
was
repressed
by
law
if
it
pleased
women
to
wear
long
trains
the
council
forbade
them
if
they
took
refuge
in
long
sleeves
thrown
back
over
their
shoulders
a
law
was
passed
which
set
a
measure
and
a
pattern
for
all
sleeves
that
might
ever
be
worn
if
a
few
rich
men
indulged
their
fancy
in
the
decoration
of
their
gondolas
now
that
riding
was
out
of
fashion
the
council
immediately
determined
that
gondolas
should
be
black
and
that
they
should
only
be
gilt
and
adorned
inside
as
for
freedom
if
any
one
talked
of
it
he
was
immediately
tortured
until
he
retracted
all
his
errors
and
was
then
promptly
beheaded
for
fear
that
he
should
fall
again
into
the
same
mistake
nella
said
so
and
told
hideous
tales
of
the
things
that
had
been
done
to
innocent
men
in
the
little
room
behind
the
council
chamber
in
the
palace
besides
if
one
talked
of
justice
there
was
zorzi
case
to
prove
that
there
was
no
justice
at
all
in
venetian
law
marietta
suddenly
wished
that
she
were
wicked
like
the
romans
and
the
florentines
and
even
when
she
reflected
that
it
was
a
sin
to
wish
that
one
were
bad
she
was
not
properly
repentant
because
she
had
a
very
vague
notion
of
what
wickedness
really
was
righteousness
seemed
just
now
to
consist
in
being
smothered
in
heavy
clothes
in
a
horribly
hot
room
while
respectable
women
of
all
ages
fat
thin
fair
dark
ugly
and
handsome
all
chattered
at
her
and
overwhelmed
her
with
nauseous
flattery
she
thought
of
that
morning
in
the
garden
three
days
ago
when
something
she
did
not
understand
had
been
so
near
just
before
disappearing
for
ever
then
her
throat
tightened
and
she
saw
indistinctly
and
her
lips
were
suddenly
dry
after
that
she
remembered
little
of
what
happened
on
that
evening
and
by
and
by
she
was
alone
in
her
own
room
without
a
light
standing
at
the
open
window
with
bare
feet
on
the
cold
pavement
and
the
night
breeze
stirred
her
hair
and
brought
her
the
scent
of
the
rosemary
and
lavender
while
she
tried
to
listen
to
the
stars
as
if
they
were
speaking
to
her
and
lost
herself
in
her
thoughts
for
a
few
moments
before
going
to
sleep
zorzi
was
still
sitting
in
the
big
chair
against
the
wall
when
he
heard
a
footstep
in
the
garden
and
as
he
rose
to
look
out
beroviero
entered
the
master
was
wrapped
in
a
long
cloak
that
covered
something
which
he
was
carrying
there
was
no
lamp
in
the
laboratory
but
the
three
fierce
eyes
of
the
furnace
shed
a
low
red
glare
in
different
directions
beroviero
had
given
orders
that
the
night
boys
should
not
come
until
he
sent
for
them
i
thought
it
wiser
to
bring
this
over
at
night
he
said
setting
a
small
iron
box
on
the
table
it
contained
the
secrets
of
paolo
godi
which
were
worth
a
great
fortune
in
those
times
of
all
my
possessions
said
the
old
man
laying
his
hands
upon
the
casket
these
are
the
most
valuable
i
will
not
hide
them
alone
as
i
might
because
if
any
harm
befell
me
they
would
be
lost
and
might
be
found
by
some
unworthy
person
could
you
not
leave
them
with
some
one
else
sir
asked
zorzi
no
i
trust
no
one
else
let
us
hide
them
together
for
i
must
leave
venice
take
up
one
of
the
large
flagstones
behind
the
annealing
oven
and
dig
a
hole
underneath
it
in
the
ground
the
place
will
be
quite
dry
from
the
heat
of
the
oven
zorzi
lit
a
lamp
with
a
splinter
of
wood
which
he
thrust
into
the
of
the
furnace
he
took
a
small
crowbar
from
the
corner
and
set
to
work
the
laboratory
contained
all
sorts
of
builder
tools
used
when
the
furnace
needed
repairing
he
raised
one
of
the
slabs
with
difficulty
turned
it
over
propped
it
with
a
billet
of
beech
wood
and
began
to
scoop
out
a
hole
in
the
hard
earth
using
a
mason
trowel
beroviero
watched
him
holding
the
box
in
his
hands
the
lock
is
not
very
good
he
said
but
i
thought
the
box
might
keep
the
packet
from
dampness
is
the
packet
properly
sealed
asked
zorzi
looking
up
you
shall
see
answered
the
master
and
he
set
down
the
box
beside
the
lamp
on
the
broad
stone
at
the
mouth
of
the
annealing
oven
it
is
better
that
you
should
see
for
yourself
he
unlocked
the
box
and
took
out
what
seemed
to
be
a
small
book
carefully
tied
up
in
a
sheet
of
parchment
the
ends
of
the
silk
cord
below
the
knot
were
pinched
in
a
broad
red
seal
zorzi
examined
the
wax
you
sealed
it
with
a
glass
seal
he
observed
it
would
not
be
hard
to
make
another
do
you
think
it
would
be
so
easy
asked
beroviero
who
had
made
the
seal
himself
many
years
ago
zorzi
held
the
impression
nearer
to
the
lamp
and
scrutinised
it
closely
no
one
will
have
a
chance
to
try
he
said
with
a
slight
gesture
of
indifference
it
might
not
be
so
easy
the
old
man
looked
at
him
a
moment
as
if
hesitating
and
then
put
the
packet
back
into
the
box
and
locked
the
latter
with
the
key
that
hung
from
his
neck
by
a
small
silver
chain
i
trust
you
he
said
and
he
gave
the
box
to
zorzi
to
be
deposited
in
the
hole
zorzi
stood
up
and
taking
a
little
tow
from
the
supply
used
for
cleaning
the
he
dipped
it
into
the
oil
of
the
lamp
and
proceeded
to
grease
the
box
carefully
before
hiding
it
it
would
rust
he
explained
he
laid
the
box
in
the
hole
and
covered
it
with
earth
before
placing
the
stone
over
it
be
careful
to
make
the
stone
lie
quite
flat
said
angelo
bending
down
and
gathering
his
gown
off
the
floor
in
a
bunch
at
his
knees
if
it
does
not
lie
flat
the
stone
will
move
when
the
boys
tread
on
it
and
they
may
think
of
taking
it
up
it
is
very
heavy
answered
the
young
man
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
heave
it
up
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
the
boys
it
is
not
a
very
safe
place
i
fear
after
all
returned
beroviero
doubtfully
be
sure
to
leave
no
marks
of
the
crowbar
and
no
loose
earth
near
it
the
heavy
slab
slipped
into
its
bed
with
a
soft
thud
zorzi
took
the
lamp
and
examined
the
edges
one
of
them
was
a
little
chipped
by
the
crowbar
and
he
rubbed
it
with
the
greasy
tow
and
scattered
dust
over
it
then
he
got
a
cypress
broom
and
swept
the
earth
carefully
away
into
a
heap
beroviero
himself
brought
the
shovel
and
held
it
close
to
the
stones
while
zorzi
pushed
the
loose
earth
upon
it
carry
it
out
and
scatter
it
in
the
garden
said
the
old
man
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
allowed
his
affection
for
zorzi
to
express
itself
so
strongly
for
he
was
generally
a
very
cautious
person
he
took
the
young
man
hand
and
held
it
a
moment
pressing
it
kindly
it
was
not
i
who
made
the
law
against
strangers
and
it
was
not
meant
for
men
like
you
he
added
zorzi
knew
how
much
this
meant
from
such
a
master
and
he
would
have
found
words
for
thanks
had
he
been
able
but
when
he
tried
they
would
not
come
you
may
trust
me
was
all
he
could
say
beroviero
left
him
and
went
down
the
dark
corridor
with
the
firm
step
of
a
man
who
knows
his
way
without
light
in
the
morning
when
he
left
the
house
to
begin
his
journey
zorzi
stood
by
the
steps
with
the
servant
to
steady
the
gondola
for
him
his
horses
were
to
be
in
waiting
in
venice
whence
he
was
to
go
over
to
the
mainland
he
nodded
to
the
young
man
carelessly
but
said
nothing
and
no
one
would
have
guessed
how
kindly
he
had
spoken
to
him
on
the
previous
night
giovanni
beroviero
took
ceremonious
leave
of
his
father
his
cap
in
his
hand
bending
low
a
lean
man
twenty
years
older
than
marietta
with
an
insignificant
brow
and
pointed
jaw
and
greedy
lips
marietta
stood
within
the
shadow
of
the
doorway
very
pale
nella
was
beside
her
and
giovanni
wife
and
further
in
at
a
respectful
distance
the
for
the
master
departure
was
an
event
of
importance
the
gondola
pushed
off
when
beroviero
had
disappeared
under
the
with
a
final
wave
of
the
hand
zorzi
stood
still
looking
after
his
master
and
marietta
came
forward
to
the
doorstep
and
pretended
to
watch
the
gondola
also
zorzi
was
the
first
to
turn
and
their
eyes
met
he
had
not
expected
to
see
her
still
there
and
he
started
a
little
giovanni
looked
at
him
coldly
you
had
better
go
to
your
work
he
said
in
a
sour
tone
i
suppose
my
father
has
told
you
what
to
do
the
young
artist
flushed
but
answered
quietly
enough
i
am
going
to
my
work
he
said
i
need
no
urging
before
he
put
on
his
cap
he
bent
his
head
to
marietta
then
he
passed
on
towards
the
bridge
that
fellow
is
growing
insolent
said
giovanni
to
his
sister
but
he
was
careful
that
zorzi
should
not
hear
the
words
i
think
i
shall
advise
our
father
to
turn
him
out
marietta
looked
at
her
brother
with
something
like
contempt
since
when
has
our
father
consulted
you
or
taken
your
advice
she
asked
i
presume
he
takes
yours
retorted
giovanni
regretting
that
he
could
not
instantly
find
a
sharper
answer
for
he
was
not
though
he
was
suspicious
he
needs
neither
yours
nor
mine
said
marietta
and
he
trusts
whom
he
pleases
you
seem
inclined
to
defend
his
servants
when
they
are
insolent
answered
giovanni
for
that
matter
zorzi
is
quite
able
to
defend
himself
she
turned
her
back
on
her
brother
and
went
towards
the
stairs
taking
nella
with
her
giovanni
glanced
at
her
with
annoyance
and
walked
along
the
footway
in
the
direction
of
his
own
glad
to
go
back
to
a
place
where
he
was
absolute
despot
but
he
had
been
really
surprised
that
marietta
should
boldly
take
the
dalmatian
side
against
him
and
his
narrow
brain
brooded
upon
the
unexpected
circumstance
besides
the
dislike
he
felt
for
the
young
artist
his
small
pride
resented
the
thought
that
his
sister
who
was
to
marry
a
contarini
should
condescend
to
the
defence
of
a
servant
zorzi
went
his
way
calmly
and
spent
the
day
in
the
laboratory
he
was
in
a
frame
of
mind
in
which
such
speeches
as
giovanni
could
make
but
little
impression
upon
him
sensitive
though
he
naturally
was
really
great
sorrows
or
great
joys
or
great
emotions
make
smaller
ones
almost
impossible
for
the
time
men
of
vast
ambition
whose
deeds
are
already
moving
the
world
and
making
history
are
sometimes
as
easily
annoyed
by
trifles
as
a
nervous
woman
but
he
who
knows
that
what
is
dearest
to
him
is
slipping
from
his
hold
or
has
just
been
taken
is
half
paralysed
in
his
sense
of
outward
things
his
own
mind
alone
has
power
to
give
him
a
momentary
relief
herein
lies
one
of
the
strongest
problems
of
human
nature
we
say
with
assurance
that
the
mind
rules
the
body
we
feel
that
the
spirit
in
some
way
overshadows
and
includes
the
mind
yet
if
this
were
really
true
the
spirit
that
is
the
will
should
have
power
against
bodily
pain
but
not
against
moral
suffering
except
with
some
help
from
a
higher
source
but
it
is
otherwise
if
the
will
of
ordinary
human
beings
could
hypnotise
the
body
against
material
sensation
the
credit
due
to
those
brave
believers
in
all
ages
who
have
suffered
cruel
torments
for
their
faith
would
be
singularly
diminished
if
the
mind
could
dominate
matter
by
ordinary
concentration
of
thought
a
bad
toothache
should
have
no
effect
upon
the
delicate
imagination
of
the
poet
and
napoleon
would
not
have
lost
the
decisive
battle
of
his
life
by
a
fit
of
indigestion
as
has
been
asserted
on
the
other
hand
there
was
never
yet
a
man
of
genius
or
even
of
great
talent
who
was
not
aware
that
the
most
acute
moral
anguish
can
be
momentarily
forgotten
as
if
it
did
not
exist
for
the
time
by
concentrating
the
mind
upon
its
accustomed
and
favourite
kind
of
work
johnson
wrote
to
pay
for
the
funeral
of
his
yet
unburied
mother
and
johnson
was
a
man
of
heart
if
ever
one
lived
he
could
not
have
written
the
book
if
he
had
had
a
headache
saints
and
ascetics
without
end
and
of
many
persuasions
have
resorted
to
bodily
pain
as
a
means
of
deadening
the
imagination
and
exalting
the
will
or
spirit
some
great
thinkers
have
been
invalids
but
in
every
case
their
food
work
has
been
done
when
they
were
temporarily
free
from
pain
perhaps
the
truth
is
on
the
side
of
those
mystics
who
say
that
although
the
mind
is
of
a
higher
nature
than
matter
it
is
so
closely
involved
with
it
that
neither
can
get
away
from
the
other
and
that
both
together
tend
to
shut
out
the
spirit
and
to
forget
its
existence
which
is
a
perpetual
reproach
to
them
and
any
ordinary
intellectual
effort
being
produced
by
the
joint
activity
of
mind
and
the
matter
through
which
the
mind
acts
the
condition
of
the
spirit
at
the
time
has
little
or
no
effect
upon
them
nor
upon
what
they
are
doing
and
if
one
would
carry
the
little
theory
further
one
might
find
that
the
greatest
works
of
genius
have
been
produced
when
the
effort
of
mind
and
matter
has
taken
place
under
the
inspiration
of
the
spirit
so
that
all
three
were
momentarily
involved
together
but
such
thoughts
lead
far
and
it
may
be
that
they
profit
little
the
best
which
a
man
means
to
do
is
generally
better
than
the
best
he
does
and
it
is
perhaps
the
best
he
is
capable
of
doing
be
these
things
as
they
may
zorzi
worked
hard
in
the
laboratory
minutely
carrying
out
the
instructions
he
had
received
but
reasoning
upon
them
with
a
freshness
and
keenness
of
thought
of
which
his
master
was
no
longer
capable
when
he
had
made
the
trials
and
had
added
the
new
ingredients
for
future
ones
he
began
to
think
out
methods
of
his
own
which
had
suggested
themselves
to
him
of
late
but
which
he
had
never
been
able
to
try
but
though
he
had
the
furnace
to
himself
to
use
as
long
as
he
could
endure
the
heat
of
the
advancing
summer
he
was
face
to
face
with
a
difficulty
that
seemed
insuperable
the
furnace
had
but
three
crucibles
each
of
which
contained
one
of
the
mixtures
by
means
of
which
he
and
beroviero
were
trying
to
produce
the
famous
red
glass
in
order
to
begin
to
make
glass
in
his
own
way
it
was
necessary
that
one
of
the
three
should
be
emptied
but
unless
he
disobeyed
his
orders
this
was
out
of
the
question
in
his
train
of
thought
and
longing
to
try
what
he
felt
sure
must
succeed
he
had
forgotten
the
obstacle
the
check
brought
him
back
to
himself
and
he
walked
disconsolately
up
and
down
the
long
room
by
the
side
of
the
furnace
everything
was
against
him
said
the
melancholy
little
demon
that
torments
genius
on
dark
days
it
was
not
enough
that
he
should
be
forced
by
every
consideration
of
honour
and
wisdom
to
hide
his
love
for
his
master
daughter
when
he
took
refuge
in
his
art
and
tried
to
throw
his
whole
life
into
it
he
was
stopped
at
the
outset
by
the
most
impassable
barriers
of
impossibility
the
furious
desire
to
create
which
is
the
strength
as
well
as
the
essence
of
genius
surged
up
and
dashed
itself
to
futile
spray
upon
the
face
of
the
solid
rock
he
stood
still
before
the
hanging
shelves
on
which
he
had
placed
the
objects
he
had
occasionally
made
and
which
his
master
allowed
him
to
keep
there
light
vessels
of
graceful
shapes
an
ampulla
of
exquisite
outline
with
a
long
curved
spout
that
bent
upwards
and
then
outwards
and
over
like
the
stalk
of
a
lily
of
the
valley
a
large
set
on
a
stem
so
slender
that
one
would
doubt
its
strength
to
carry
the
weight
of
a
full
measure
yet
so
strong
that
the
cup
might
have
been
filled
with
lead
without
breaking
it
a
broad
dish
that
was
nothing
but
a
shadow
against
the
light
but
in
the
shadow
was
a
fair
design
of
flowers
drawn
free
with
a
diamond
point
there
were
a
dozen
of
such
things
on
the
shelves
not
the
best
that
zorzi
had
made
for
those
beroviero
took
to
his
own
house
and
used
on
great
occasions
while
these
were
the
results
of
experiments
unheard
of
in
those
days
and
which
not
long
afterwards
made
a
school
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
zorzi
felt
a
foolish
impulse
to
take
them
down
and
smash
them
one
by
one
in
the
big
jar
into
which
the
failures
were
thrown
to
be
melted
again
in
the
main
furnace
for
in
a
nothing
is
thrown
away
he
knew
it
was
foolish
and
he
held
his
hands
behind
him
as
he
looked
at
the
things
wishing
that
he
had
never
made
them
that
he
had
never
learned
the
art
he
was
forbidden
by
law
to
practise
that
he
had
never
left
dalmatia
as
a
little
boy
long
ago
that
he
had
never
been
born
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
giovanni
entered
zorzi
turned
and
looked
at
him
in
silence
he
was
surprised
but
he
supposed
that
the
son
had
a
right
to
come
if
he
chose
though
he
never
showed
himself
in
the
when
his
father
was
in
murano
are
you
alone
here
asked
giovanni
looking
about
him
do
none
of
the
workmen
come
here
the
master
has
left
me
in
charge
of
his
work
answered
zorzi
i
need
no
help
giovanni
seated
himself
in
his
father
chair
and
looked
at
the
table
before
the
window
it
is
not
very
hard
work
i
fancy
he
observed
crossing
one
leg
over
the
other
and
pulling
up
his
black
hose
to
make
it
fit
his
lean
calf
better
zorzi
suspected
at
once
that
he
had
come
in
search
of
information
and
paused
before
answering
the
work
needs
careful
attention
he
said
at
last
most
does
observed
giovanni
with
a
harsh
little
laugh
are
you
very
attentive
then
do
you
remember
to
do
all
that
my
father
told
you
the
master
only
left
this
morning
so
far
i
have
obeyed
his
orders
i
do
not
understand
how
a
man
who
is
not
a
can
know
enough
to
be
left
alone
in
charge
of
a
furnace
said
giovanni
looking
at
zorzi
profile
this
time
zorzi
was
silent
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
tell
how
much
he
knew
i
suppose
my
father
knows
what
he
is
about
continued
giovanni
in
a
tone
of
disapproval
zorzi
thought
so
too
and
no
reply
seemed
necessary
he
stood
still
looking
out
of
the
window
and
wishing
that
his
visitor
would
go
away
but
giovanni
had
no
such
intention
what
are
you
making
he
asked
presently
a
certain
kind
of
glass
zorzi
answered
a
new
colour
a
certain
colour
that
is
all
i
can
tell
you
you
can
tell
me
what
colour
it
is
said
giovanni
why
are
you
so
secret
even
if
my
father
had
ordered
you
to
be
silent
with
me
about
his
work
which
i
do
not
believe
you
would
not
be
betraying
anything
by
telling
me
that
what
colour
is
he
trying
to
make
i
am
to
say
nothing
about
it
not
even
to
you
i
obey
my
orders
giovanni
was
a
himself
he
rose
with
an
air
of
annoyance
and
crossed
the
laboratory
to
the
jar
in
which
the
broken
glass
was
kept
took
out
a
piece
and
held
it
up
against
the
light
zorzi
had
made
a
movement
as
if
to
hinder
him
but
he
realised
at
once
that
he
could
not
lay
hands
on
his
master
son
giovanni
laughed
contemptuously
and
threw
the
fragment
back
into
the
jar
is
that
all
i
can
do
better
than
that
myself
he
said
and
he
sat
down
again
in
the
big
chair
his
eyes
fell
on
the
shelves
upon
which
zorzi
specimens
of
work
were
arranged
he
looked
at
them
with
interest
at
once
understanding
their
commercial
value
my
father
can
make
good
things
when
he
is
not
wasting
time
over
discoveries
he
remarked
and
rising
again
he
went
nearer
and
began
to
examine
the
little
objects
zorzi
said
nothing
and
after
looking
at
them
a
long
time
giovanni
turned
away
and
stood
before
the
furnace
the
copper
ladle
with
which
the
specimens
were
taken
from
the
pots
lay
on
the
brick
ledge
near
one
of
the
giovanni
took
it
looked
round
to
see
where
the
iron
plate
for
testing
was
placed
and
thrust
the
ladle
into
the
aperture
holding
it
lightly
lest
the
heat
should
hurt
his
hand
you
shall
not
do
that
cried
zorzi
who
was
already
beside
him
before
giovanni
knew
what
was
happening
zorzi
had
struck
the
ladle
from
his
hand
and
it
disappeared
through
the
into
the
glass
within
chapter
ix
with
an
oath
giovanni
raised
his
hand
to
strike
zorzi
in
the
face
but
the
quick
dalmatian
snatched
up
his
heavy
in
both
hands
and
stood
in
an
attitude
of
defence
if
you
try
to
strike
me
i
shall
defend
myself
he
said
quietly
giovanni
sour
face
turned
grey
with
fright
and
then
as
his
impotent
anger
rose
the
grey
took
an
almost
greenish
hue
that
was
bad
to
see
he
smiled
in
a
sickly
fashion
zorzi
set
the
upright
against
the
furnace
and
watched
him
for
he
saw
that
the
man
was
afraid
of
him
and
might
act
treacherously
you
need
not
be
so
violent
said
giovanni
and
his
voice
trembled
a
little
as
he
recovered
himself
after
all
my
father
would
not
have
made
any
objection
to
my
trying
the
glass
if
i
had
i
could
not
have
guessed
how
it
was
made
zorzi
did
not
answer
for
he
had
discovered
that
silence
was
his
best
weapon
giovanni
continued
in
the
peevish
tone
of
a
man
who
has
been
badly
frightened
and
is
ashamed
of
it
it
only
shows
how
ignorant
you
are
of
if
you
suppose
that
my
father
would
care
as
he
still
got
no
reply
beyond
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
he
changed
the
subject
did
you
see
my
father
make
any
of
those
things
he
asked
pointing
to
the
shelves
no
answered
zorzi
but
he
made
them
all
here
did
he
not
insisted
giovanni
and
you
are
always
with
him
he
did
not
make
any
of
them
giovanni
opened
his
eyes
in
astonishment
in
his
estimation
there
was
no
man
living
except
his
father
who
could
have
done
such
work
zorzi
smiled
for
he
knew
what
the
other
astonishment
meant
i
made
them
all
he
said
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
to
take
the
credit
that
was
justly
his
you
made
those
things
repeated
giovanni
incredulously
but
zorzi
was
not
in
the
least
offended
by
his
disbelief
the
more
sceptical
giovanni
was
the
greater
the
honour
in
having
produced
anything
so
rarely
beautiful
i
made
those
and
many
others
which
the
master
keeps
in
his
house
he
said
giovanni
would
have
liked
to
give
him
the
lie
but
he
dared
not
just
then
if
you
made
them
you
could
make
something
of
the
kind
again
he
said
i
should
like
to
see
that
take
your
and
try
then
i
shall
believe
you
there
is
no
white
glass
in
the
furnace
answered
zorzi
if
there
were
i
would
show
you
what
i
can
do
giovanni
laughed
sourly
i
thought
you
would
find
some
good
excuse
he
said
the
master
saw
me
do
the
work
answered
zorzi
unconcernedly
ask
him
about
it
when
he
comes
back
there
are
other
furnaces
in
the
suggested
giovanni
why
not
bring
your
with
you
and
show
the
workmen
as
well
as
me
what
you
can
do
zorzi
hesitated
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
this
might
be
a
decisive
moment
in
his
life
in
which
the
future
would
depend
on
the
decision
he
made
in
all
the
years
since
he
had
been
with
beroviero
he
had
never
worked
at
one
of
the
great
furnaces
among
the
other
men
i
daresay
your
sense
of
responsibility
is
so
great
that
you
do
not
like
to
leave
the
laboratory
even
for
half
an
hour
said
giovanni
scornfully
but
you
have
to
go
home
at
night
i
sleep
here
answered
zorzi
indeed
giovanni
was
surprised
i
see
that
your
objections
are
insuperable
he
added
with
a
laugh
zorzi
was
in
one
of
those
moods
in
which
a
man
feels
that
he
has
nothing
to
lose
there
might
however
be
something
to
gain
by
exhibiting
his
skill
before
giovanni
and
the
men
his
reputation
as
a
would
be
made
in
half
an
hour
since
you
do
not
believe
me
come
he
said
at
last
you
shall
see
for
yourself
he
took
his
and
thrust
it
through
one
of
the
to
melt
off
the
little
red
glass
that
adhered
to
it
then
he
cooled
it
in
water
and
carefully
removed
the
small
particles
that
stuck
to
the
iron
here
and
there
like
spots
of
glazing
i
am
ready
he
said
when
he
had
finished
giovanni
rose
and
led
the
way
without
a
word
zorzi
followed
him
shut
the
door
turned
the
key
twice
and
thrust
it
into
the
bosom
of
his
doublet
giovanni
turned
and
watched
him
you
are
really
very
cautions
he
said
do
you
always
lock
the
door
when
you
go
out
always
answered
zorzi
shouldering
his
they
crossed
the
little
garden
and
entered
the
passage
that
led
to
the
main
furnace
rooms
in
the
first
they
entered
eight
or
ten
men
and
youths
masters
and
apprentices
were
at
work
the
place
was
higher
and
far
more
spacious
than
the
laboratory
the
furnace
was
broader
and
taller
and
had
four
mouths
instead
of
three
the
sunlight
streamed
through
a
window
high
above
the
floor
and
fell
upon
the
arched
back
of
the
annealing
oven
the
window
being
so
placed
that
the
sun
could
never
shine
upon
the
working
end
and
dazzle
the
workmen
when
giovanni
and
zorzi
entered
the
men
were
working
in
silence
the
low
and
steady
roar
of
the
flames
was
varied
by
the
occasional
sharp
click
of
iron
or
the
soft
sound
of
hot
glass
rolling
on
the
marver
or
by
the
hiss
of
a
metal
instrument
plunged
into
water
to
cool
it
every
man
had
an
apprentice
to
help
him
and
two
boys
tended
the
fire
the
foreman
sat
at
a
table
busy
with
an
account
a
small
man
even
paler
than
the
others
and
dressed
in
shabby
brown
hose
and
a
loose
brown
coat
the
workmen
wore
only
hose
and
shirts
without
desisting
from
their
occupations
they
cast
surprised
glances
at
giovanni
and
his
companion
whom
they
all
hated
as
a
favoured
person
one
of
them
was
finishing
a
rolling
the
pontil
on
the
arms
of
the
another
a
fellow
swung
his
long
with
its
lump
of
glowing
glass
in
a
full
circle
high
in
air
and
almost
to
touch
the
ground
another
was
at
a
in
the
low
glare
all
were
busy
and
the
air
was
very
hot
and
close
the
men
looked
grim
and
giovanni
explained
the
object
of
his
coming
in
a
way
intended
to
conciliate
them
to
himself
at
zorzi
expense
their
presence
gave
him
courage
this
is
zorzi
the
man
without
a
name
he
said
who
is
come
from
dalmatia
to
give
us
a
lesson
in
one
of
the
men
laughed
and
the
apprentices
tittered
the
others
looked
as
if
they
did
not
understand
zorzi
had
known
well
enough
what
humour
he
should
find
among
them
but
he
would
not
let
the
taunt
go
unanswered
sirs
he
said
for
they
all
claimed
the
nobility
of
the
caste
i
come
not
to
teach
you
but
to
prove
to
the
master
son
that
i
can
make
some
trifle
in
the
manner
of
your
art
no
one
spoke
the
workmen
in
the
elder
beroviero
house
knew
well
enough
that
zorzi
was
a
better
artist
than
they
and
they
had
no
mind
to
let
him
outdo
them
at
their
own
furnace
will
any
one
of
you
gentlemen
allow
me
to
use
his
place
asked
zorzi
civilly
not
a
man
answered
in
the
sullen
silence
the
busy
hands
moved
with
quick
skill
the
furnace
roared
the
glowing
glass
grew
in
shapes
one
of
you
must
give
zorzi
his
place
said
giovanni
in
a
tone
of
authority
the
little
foreman
turned
quite
round
in
his
chair
and
looked
on
there
was
no
reply
the
pale
men
went
on
with
their
work
as
if
giovanni
were
not
there
and
zorzi
leaned
calmly
on
his
giovanni
moved
a
step
forward
and
spoke
directly
to
one
of
the
men
who
had
just
dropped
a
finished
glass
into
the
bed
of
soft
wood
ashes
to
be
taken
to
the
annealing
oven
stop
working
for
a
while
he
said
let
zorzi
have
your
place
the
foreman
gives
orders
here
not
you
answered
the
man
coolly
and
he
prepared
to
begin
another
piece
giovanni
was
very
angry
but
there
were
too
many
of
the
workmen
and
he
did
not
say
what
rose
to
his
lips
but
crossed
over
to
the
foreman
zorzi
kept
his
place
waiting
to
see
what
might
happen
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
order
one
of
the
men
to
give
up
his
place
giovanni
asked
the
old
foreman
smiled
at
this
humble
acknowledgment
of
his
authority
but
he
argued
the
point
before
acceding
the
men
know
well
enough
what
zorzi
can
do
he
answered
in
a
low
voice
they
dislike
him
because
he
is
not
one
of
us
i
advise
you
to
take
him
to
your
own
sir
if
you
wish
to
see
him
work
you
will
only
make
trouble
here
i
am
not
afraid
of
any
trouble
i
tell
you
replied
giovanni
please
do
what
i
ask
very
well
i
will
but
i
take
no
responsibility
before
the
master
if
there
is
a
disturbance
the
men
are
in
a
bad
humour
and
the
weather
is
hot
i
will
be
responsible
to
my
father
said
giovanni
very
well
repeated
the
old
man
you
are
a
yourself
like
the
rest
of
us
you
know
how
we
look
upon
foreigners
who
steal
their
knowledge
of
our
art
i
wish
to
make
sure
that
he
has
really
stolen
something
of
it
the
foreman
laughed
outright
you
will
be
convinced
soon
enough
he
said
give
your
place
to
the
foreigner
piero
he
added
speaking
to
the
man
who
had
refused
to
move
at
giovanni
bidding
piero
at
once
chilled
the
fresh
lump
of
glass
he
had
begun
to
fashion
and
smashed
it
off
the
tube
into
the
refuse
jar
without
a
word
zorzi
took
his
place
while
he
warmed
the
end
of
his
at
the
he
looked
to
right
and
left
to
see
where
the
and
marver
were
placed
and
to
be
sure
that
the
few
tools
he
needed
were
at
hand
the
pontil
the
that
is
the
small
elastic
tongs
for
modelling
and
the
shears
piero
apprentice
had
retired
to
a
distance
as
he
had
received
no
special
orders
and
the
workmen
hoped
that
zorzi
would
find
himself
in
difficulty
at
the
moment
when
he
would
turn
in
the
expectation
of
finding
the
assistant
at
his
elbow
but
zorzi
was
used
to
helping
himself
he
pushed
his
into
the
melted
glass
and
drew
it
out
let
it
cool
a
moment
and
then
thrust
it
in
again
to
take
up
more
of
the
stuff
the
men
went
on
with
their
work
seeming
to
pay
no
attention
to
him
and
piero
turned
his
back
and
talked
to
the
foreman
in
low
tones
only
giovanni
watched
standing
far
enough
back
to
be
out
of
reach
of
the
long
if
zorzi
should
unexpectedly
swing
it
to
its
full
length
zorzi
was
confident
and
unconcerned
though
he
was
fully
aware
that
the
men
were
watching
every
movement
he
made
while
pretending
not
to
see
he
knew
also
that
owing
to
his
being
partly
he
did
certain
things
in
ways
of
his
own
they
should
see
that
his
ways
were
as
good
as
theirs
and
what
was
more
that
he
needed
no
help
while
none
of
them
could
do
anything
without
an
apprentice
the
glass
grew
and
swelled
lengthened
and
contracted
with
his
breath
and
under
his
touch
and
the
men
furtively
watching
him
were
amazed
to
see
how
much
he
could
do
while
the
piece
was
still
on
the
but
when
he
could
do
no
more
they
thought
that
he
would
have
trouble
he
did
not
even
turn
his
head
to
see
whether
any
one
was
near
to
help
him
at
the
exact
moment
when
the
work
was
cool
enough
to
stand
he
attached
the
pontil
with
its
drop
of
liquid
glass
to
the
lower
end
as
he
had
done
many
a
time
in
the
laboratory
and
before
those
who
looked
on
could
fully
understand
how
he
had
done
it
without
assistance
the
long
and
heavy
lay
on
the
floor
and
zorzi
held
his
piece
on
the
lighter
pontil
heating
it
again
at
the
fire
the
men
did
not
stop
working
but
they
glanced
at
each
other
and
nodded
when
zorzi
could
not
see
them
giovanni
uttered
a
low
exclamation
of
surprise
the
foreman
alone
now
watched
zorzi
with
genuine
admiration
there
was
no
mistaking
the
jealous
attitude
of
the
others
it
was
not
the
mean
envy
of
the
inferior
artist
either
for
they
were
men
who
in
their
way
loved
art
as
beroviero
himself
did
and
if
zorzi
had
been
a
new
companion
recently
promoted
from
the
state
of
apprenticeship
in
the
guild
they
would
have
looked
on
in
wonder
and
delight
even
if
at
the
very
beginning
he
outdid
them
all
what
they
felt
was
quite
different
it
was
the
deep
fierce
hatred
of
the
mediaeval
guildsman
for
the
stranger
who
had
stolen
knowledge
without
apprenticeship
and
without
citizenship
and
it
was
made
more
intense
because
the
were
the
only
guild
that
excluded
every
man
without
any
exception
it
was
a
shame
to
them
to
be
outdone
by
one
who
had
not
their
blood
nor
their
teaching
nor
their
high
acknowledged
rights
they
were
peaceable
men
in
their
way
not
given
to
quarrelling
nor
vicious
yet
excepting
the
mild
old
foreman
there
was
not
one
of
them
who
would
not
gladly
have
brought
his
iron
down
on
head
with
a
swing
to
strike
the
life
out
of
the
intruder
zorzi
deft
hands
made
the
large
piece
he
was
forming
spin
on
itself
and
take
new
shape
at
every
turn
until
it
had
the
perfect
curve
of
those
eastern
vessels
for
pouring
water
upon
the
hands
which
have
not
even
now
quite
degenerated
from
their
early
grace
of
form
while
it
was
still
very
hot
he
took
a
sharp
pointed
knife
from
his
belt
and
with
a
turn
of
his
hand
cut
a
small
round
hole
low
down
on
one
side
the
mouth
was
widened
and
then
turned
in
and
out
like
the
leaf
of
a
carnation
he
left
the
cooling
piece
on
the
pontil
lying
across
the
arms
of
the
stool
and
took
his
again
has
the
fellow
not
finished
his
tricks
yet
asked
piero
discontentedly
it
would
have
given
him
pleasure
to
smash
the
beautiful
thing
to
atoms
where
it
lay
almost
within
his
reach
zorzi
began
to
make
the
spout
for
it
was
a
large
ampulla
that
he
was
fashioning
he
drew
the
glass
out
widened
it
narrowed
it
cut
it
bent
it
and
finished
off
the
nozzle
before
he
touched
it
with
wet
iron
and
made
it
drop
into
the
ashes
a
moment
later
he
had
heated
the
thick
end
of
it
again
and
was
welding
it
over
the
hole
he
had
made
in
the
body
of
the
vessel
the
man
has
three
hands
exclaimed
the
foreman
and
two
of
them
are
for
stealing
added
piero
or
all
three
put
in
the
man
who
was
working
next
to
zorzi
zorzi
looked
at
him
coldly
a
moment
but
said
nothing
they
did
not
mean
that
he
was
a
thief
except
in
the
sense
that
he
had
stolen
his
knowledge
of
their
art
he
went
on
to
make
the
handle
of
the
ampulla
an
easy
matter
compared
with
making
the
spout
but
the
highest
part
of
lies
in
shaping
graceful
curves
and
it
is
often
in
the
smallest
differences
of
measurement
that
the
pieces
made
by
beroviero
and
zorzi
preserved
intact
to
this
day
differ
from
similar
things
made
by
lesser
artists
yet
in
those
little
variations
lies
all
the
great
secret
that
divides
grace
from
awkwardness
zorzi
now
had
the
whole
vessel
with
its
spout
and
handle
on
the
pontil
it
was
finished
but
he
could
still
ornament
it
his
own
instinct
was
to
let
it
alone
leaving
its
perfect
shape
and
airy
lightness
to
be
its
only
beauty
and
he
turned
it
thoughtfully
as
he
looked
at
it
hesitating
whether
he
should
detach
it
from
the
iron
or
do
more
if
you
have
finished
your
nonsense
let
me
come
back
to
my
work
said
piero
behind
him
zorzi
did
not
turn
to
answer
for
he
had
decided
to
add
some
delicate
ornaments
merely
to
show
giovanni
that
he
was
a
full
master
of
the
art
the
man
had
just
collected
a
heavy
lump
of
glass
on
the
end
of
his
and
was
blowing
into
it
before
giving
it
the
first
swing
that
would
lengthen
it
out
he
and
piero
exchanged
glances
unnoticed
by
zorzi
who
had
become
almost
unconscious
of
their
hostile
presence
he
began
to
take
little
drops
of
glass
from
the
furnace
on
the
end
of
a
thin
iron
and
he
drew
them
out
into
thick
threads
and
heated
them
again
and
laid
them
on
the
body
of
the
ampulla
twisting
and
turning
each
bit
till
he
had
no
more
and
forming
a
regular
raised
design
on
the
surface
his
neighbour
seemed
to
get
no
further
with
what
he
was
doing
though
he
busily
heated
and
reheated
his
lump
of
glass
and
again
and
again
swung
his
round
his
head
and
backward
and
forward
the
foreman
was
too
much
interested
in
zorzi
to
notice
what
the
others
were
doing
zorzi
was
putting
the
last
touches
to
his
work
in
a
moment
it
would
be
finished
and
ready
to
go
to
the
annealing
oven
though
he
was
even
then
reflecting
that
the
workmen
would
certainly
break
it
up
as
soon
as
the
foreman
turned
his
back
the
man
next
to
him
swung
his
again
loaded
with
glass
it
slipped
from
his
hand
and
the
hot
mass
with
the
full
weight
of
the
heavy
iron
behind
it
landed
on
zorzi
right
foot
three
paces
away
with
frightful
force
he
uttered
a
sharp
cry
of
surprise
and
pain
the
lovely
vessel
he
had
made
flew
from
his
hands
and
broke
into
a
thousand
tiny
fragments
in
excruciating
agony
he
lifted
the
injured
foot
from
the
ground
and
stood
upon
the
other
not
a
hand
was
stretched
out
to
help
him
and
he
felt
that
he
was
growing
dizzy
he
made
a
frantic
effort
to
hop
on
one
leg
towards
the
furnace
so
as
to
lean
against
the
brickwork
piero
laughed
he
is
a
dancer
he
cried
he
is
a
the
others
all
laughed
too
and
the
name
remained
his
as
long
as
he
lived
he
was
zorzi
ballarin
the
old
foreman
came
to
help
him
seeing
that
he
was
really
injured
for
no
one
had
quite
realised
it
at
first
savagely
as
they
hated
him
the
workmen
would
not
have
tortured
him
though
they
might
have
killed
him
outright
if
they
had
dared
excepting
piero
and
the
man
who
had
hurt
him
the
workmen
all
went
on
with
their
work
he
was
ghastly
pale
and
great
drops
of
sweat
rolled
down
his
forehead
as
he
reached
the
foreman
chair
and
sat
down
but
after
the
first
cry
he
had
uttered
he
made
no
sound
the
foreman
could
hear
how
his
teeth
ground
upon
each
other
as
he
mastered
the
frightful
suffering
giovanni
came
and
stood
looking
at
the
helpless
foot
smashed
by
the
weight
that
had
fallen
upon
it
and
burned
to
the
bone
in
an
instant
by
the
molten
glass
i
can
not
walk
he
said
at
last
to
the
foreman
will
you
help
me
his
voice
was
steady
but
weak
the
foreman
and
giovanni
helped
him
to
stand
on
his
left
foot
and
putting
his
arms
round
their
necks
he
swung
himself
along
as
he
could
the
dark
man
had
picked
up
his
and
was
at
work
again
you
will
pay
for
that
when
the
master
comes
back
piero
said
to
him
as
zorzi
passed
you
will
starve
if
you
are
not
careful
zorzi
turned
his
head
and
looked
the
dark
man
full
in
the
eyes
it
was
an
accident
he
said
faintly
you
did
not
mean
to
do
it
the
man
looked
away
shamefacedly
for
he
knew
that
even
if
he
had
not
meant
to
injure
zorzi
for
life
he
had
meant
to
hurt
him
if
he
could
as
for
giovanni
he
was
puzzled
by
all
that
had
happened
so
unexpectedly
for
he
was
a
dull
man
though
very
keen
for
gain
and
he
did
not
understand
human
nature
he
disliked
zorzi
but
during
the
morning
he
had
become
convinced
that
the
gifted
young
artist
was
a
valuable
piece
of
property
and
not
as
he
had
supposed
a
clever
flatterer
who
had
wormed
himself
into
old
beroviero
confidence
a
man
who
could
make
such
things
was
worth
much
money
to
his
master
there
were
kings
and
princes
from
the
pope
to
the
emperor
who
would
have
given
a
round
sum
in
gold
for
the
beautiful
ampulla
of
which
only
a
heap
of
tiny
fragments
were
now
left
to
be
swept
away
the
two
men
brought
zorzi
across
the
garden
to
the
door
of
the
laboratory
leaning
heavily
on
the
foreman
he
got
the
key
out
and
giovanni
turned
it
in
the
lock
they
would
have
taken
him
to
the
small
inner
room
to
lay
him
on
his
pallet
bed
but
he
would
not
go
the
bench
he
managed
to
say
indicating
it
with
a
nod
of
his
head
there
was
an
old
leathern
pillow
in
the
big
chair
the
foreman
took
it
and
placed
it
under
zorzi
head
we
must
get
a
surgeon
to
dress
his
wound
said
the
foreman
i
will
send
for
one
answered
giovanni
is
there
anything
you
want
now
he
asked
with
an
attempt
to
speak
kindly
to
the
valuable
piece
of
property
that
lay
helpless
before
him
water
said
zorzi
very
faintly
and
feed
the
fire
it
must
be
time
the
foreman
dipped
a
cupful
of
water
from
an
earthen
jar
held
up
his
head
and
helped
him
to
drink
giovanni
pushed
some
wood
into
the
furnace
i
will
send
for
a
surgeon
he
repeated
and
went
out
zorzi
closed
his
eyes
and
the
foreman
stood
looking
at
him
do
not
stay
here
zorzi
said
you
can
do
nothing
for
me
and
the
surgeon
will
come
presently
then
the
foreman
also
left
him
and
he
was
alone
it
was
not
in
his
nature
to
give
way
to
bodily
pain
but
he
was
glad
the
men
were
gone
for
he
could
not
have
borne
much
more
in
silence
he
turned
his
head
to
the
wall
and
bit
the
edge
of
the
leathern
cushion
now
and
then
his
whole
body
shook
convulsively
he
did
not
hear
the
door
open
again
for
the
torturing
pain
that
shot
through
him
dulled
all
his
other
senses
he
wished
that
he
might
faint
away
even
for
a
moment
but
his
nerves
were
too
sound
for
that
he
was
recalled
to
outer
things
by
feeling
a
hand
laid
gently
on
his
leg
and
immediately
afterwards
he
heard
a
man
voice
in
a
quietly
gruff
tone
that
scarcely
rose
or
fell
reciting
a
whole
litany
of
the
most
appalling
blasphemies
that
ever
fell
from
human
lips
for
an
instant
in
his
suffering
zorzi
fancied
that
he
had
died
and
was
in
the
clutches
of
satan
himself
he
turned
his
head
on
the
cushion
and
saw
the
ugly
face
of
the
old
porter
who
was
bending
down
and
examining
the
wounded
foot
while
he
steadily
cursed
everything
in
heaven
and
earth
with
an
earnestness
that
would
have
been
grotesque
had
his
language
been
less
frightful
for
a
few
moments
zorzi
almost
forgot
that
he
was
hurt
as
he
listened
not
a
saint
in
the
calendar
seemed
likely
to
escape
the
porter
fury
and
he
even
went
to
the
length
of
cursing
the
relatives
male
and
female
of
martyrs
and
other
good
persons
about
whose
families
he
could
not
possibly
know
anything
for
heaven
sake
pasquale
cried
zorzi
you
will
certainly
be
struck
by
lightning
he
had
always
supposed
that
the
porter
hated
him
as
every
one
else
did
and
he
could
not
understand
by
this
time
he
was
far
more
helpless
than
he
had
been
just
after
he
had
been
hurt
and
when
he
tried
to
move
the
injured
foot
to
a
more
comfortable
position
it
felt
like
a
lump
of
scorching
lead
the
porter
entered
upon
a
final
malediction
which
might
be
supposed
to
have
gathered
destructive
force
by
collecting
into
itself
all
those
that
had
gone
before
and
he
directed
the
whole
complex
anathema
upon
the
soul
of
the
coward
who
had
done
the
foul
deed
and
upon
his
mother
his
sisters
and
his
daughters
if
he
had
any
and
upon
the
souls
of
all
his
dead
relations
men
women
and
children
and
all
of
his
relations
that
should
ever
be
born
to
the
end
of
time
he
had
been
a
sailor
in
his
youth
who
did
that
to
you
he
asked
when
he
had
thus
devoted
the
unknown
offender
to
everlasting
perdition
give
me
some
water
please
said
zorzi
instead
of
answering
the
question
water
oh
yes
pasquale
went
to
the
earthen
jar
water
every
devil
in
hell
old
and
young
will
jump
and
laugh
for
joy
when
that
man
asks
for
water
and
has
to
drink
flames
zorzi
drank
eagerly
though
the
water
was
tepid
drink
my
son
said
pasquale
holding
his
head
up
very
tenderly
with
one
of
his
rough
hands
i
will
put
more
within
reach
for
you
to
drink
while
i
go
and
get
help
they
have
sent
for
a
surgeon
answered
zorzi
a
surgeon
no
surgeon
shall
come
here
a
surgeon
will
divide
you
into
lengths
fore
and
aft
and
kill
you
by
inches
a
length
each
day
and
for
every
day
he
takes
to
kill
you
he
will
ask
a
piece
of
silver
of
the
master
if
a
surgeon
comes
here
i
will
throw
him
out
into
the
canal
this
is
a
burn
and
it
needs
an
old
woman
to
dress
it
women
are
evil
beings
a
chastisement
sent
upon
us
for
our
sins
but
an
old
woman
can
dress
a
burn
i
go
there
is
the
water
zorzi
called
him
back
when
he
was
already
at
the
door
the
fire
it
must
not
go
down
put
a
little
wood
in
pasquale
the
old
porter
grumbled
it
was
unnatural
that
a
man
so
badly
hurt
should
think
of
his
duties
but
in
his
heart
he
admired
zorzi
all
the
more
for
it
he
took
some
wood
and
when
zorzi
looked
he
was
trying
to
poke
it
through
the
not
there
cried
zorzi
desperately
the
small
opening
on
the
side
near
the
floor
pasquale
uttered
several
maledictions
how
should
i
know
he
asked
when
he
had
found
the
right
place
am
i
a
night
boy
have
i
ever
tended
fires
for
two
pence
a
night
and
my
supper
there
i
go
zorzi
could
hear
his
voice
still
as
he
went
out
a
surgeon
he
grumbled
i
should
like
to
see
the
nose
of
that
surgeon
at
the
door
zorzi
cared
little
who
came
so
that
he
got
some
relief
his
head
was
hot
now
and
the
blood
beat
in
his
temples
like
little
fiery
hammers
that
made
a
sort
of
screaming
noise
in
his
brain
he
saw
queer
lights
in
circles
and
the
beams
of
the
ceiling
came
down
very
near
and
then
suddenly
went
very
far
away
so
that
the
room
seemed
a
hundred
feet
high
the
pain
filled
all
his
right
side
and
he
even
thought
he
could
feel
it
in
his
arm
all
at
once
he
started
and
as
he
lay
on
his
back
his
hands
tried
to
grip
the
flat
wood
of
the
bench
and
his
eyes
were
wide
open
and
fixed
in
a
sort
of
frightened
stare
what
if
he
should
go
mad
with
pain
who
would
remember
the
fire
in
the
master
furnace
worse
than
that
what
safety
was
there
that
in
his
delirium
he
should
not
speak
of
the
book
that
was
hidden
under
the
stone
the
third
from
the
oven
and
the
fourth
from
the
corner
his
brain
whirled
but
he
would
not
go
mad
nor
lose
consciousness
so
long
as
he
had
the
shadow
of
free
will
left
rather
than
lie
there
on
his
back
he
would
get
off
his
bench
cost
what
it
might
and
drag
himself
to
the
mouth
of
the
furnace
there
was
a
supply
of
wood
there
piled
up
by
the
night
boys
for
use
during
the
day
he
could
get
to
it
even
if
he
had
to
roll
himself
over
and
over
on
the
floor
if
he
could
do
that
he
could
keep
his
hold
upon
his
consciousness
the
touch
of
the
billets
would
remind
him
the
heat
and
the
roar
of
the
fire
would
keep
him
awake
and
in
his
right
mind
he
raised
himself
slowly
and
put
his
uninjured
foot
to
the
floor
then
with
both
hands
he
lifted
the
other
leg
off
the
bench
he
was
conscious
of
an
increase
of
pain
which
had
seemed
impossible
it
shot
through
and
through
his
whole
body
and
he
saw
flames
there
was
only
one
way
to
do
it
he
must
get
down
upon
his
hands
and
his
left
knee
and
drag
himself
to
the
furnace
in
that
way
it
was
a
thing
of
infinite
difficulty
and
suffering
but
he
did
it
inch
by
inch
he
got
nearer
as
his
right
hand
grasped
a
billet
of
wood
from
the
little
pile
something
seemed
to
break
in
his
head
his
strength
collapsed
he
fell
forward
from
his
knee
to
his
full
length
in
the
ashes
and
dust
and
he
felt
nothing
more
chapter
x
the
porter
unbarred
the
door
and
looked
out
it
was
nearly
noon
and
the
southerly
breeze
was
blowing
the
footway
was
almost
deserted
on
the
other
side
of
the
canal
in
the
shadow
of
the
beroviero
house
an
old
man
who
sold
melons
in
slices
had
gone
to
sleep
under
a
bit
of
ragged
awning
and
the
flies
had
their
will
of
him
and
his
wares
a
small
boy
simply
dressed
in
a
shirt
and
nothing
else
stood
at
a
little
distance
looking
at
the
fruit
and
listening
attentively
to
the
voice
of
the
tempter
that
bade
him
help
himself
pasquale
looked
at
the
house
opposite
everything
was
quiet
and
the
shutters
were
drawn
together
but
not
quite
closed
the
flowers
outside
marietta
window
waved
in
the
light
breeze
nella
cried
pasquale
just
as
he
was
accustomed
to
call
the
maid
when
marietta
wanted
her
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
little
boy
who
was
about
to
deal
effectually
with
his
temptation
by
yielding
to
it
at
once
took
to
his
heels
and
ran
away
but
no
one
looked
out
from
the
house
pasquale
called
again
somewhat
louder
the
shutters
of
marietta
window
were
slowly
opened
inward
and
marietta
herself
appeared
all
in
white
and
pale
looking
over
the
flowers
what
is
it
she
asked
why
do
you
want
nella
the
canal
was
narrow
so
that
one
could
talk
across
it
almost
in
an
ordinary
tone
your
pardon
lady
answered
pasquale
i
did
not
mean
to
disturb
you
there
has
been
a
little
accident
here
saving
your
grace
this
he
added
to
avert
possible
ill
fortune
marietta
instantly
thought
of
zorzi
she
leaned
forward
upon
the
above
the
flowers
and
spoke
anxiously
what
has
happened
tell
me
quickly
a
man
has
had
his
foot
badly
burned
it
must
be
dressed
at
once
who
is
it
zorzi
pasquale
saw
that
marietta
started
a
little
and
drew
back
then
she
leaned
forward
again
wait
there
a
minute
she
said
and
disappeared
quickly
the
porter
heard
her
calling
nella
from
an
inner
room
and
then
he
heard
nella
voice
indistinctly
he
waited
before
the
open
door
nella
was
a
born
chatterer
but
she
had
her
good
qualities
and
in
an
emergency
she
was
silent
and
skilful
leave
it
to
me
she
said
he
will
need
no
surgeon
in
her
room
she
had
a
small
store
of
simple
remedies
sweet
oil
a
pot
of
balsam
old
linen
carefully
rolled
up
in
little
bundles
a
precious
ointment
made
from
the
fat
of
vipers
which
was
a
marvellous
cure
for
rheumatism
in
the
joints
some
syrup
of
poppies
in
a
stumpy
phial
a
box
of
powdered
iris
root
and
another
of
saffron
she
took
the
sweet
oil
the
balsam
and
some
linen
she
also
took
a
small
pair
of
scissors
which
were
among
her
most
precious
possessions
she
threw
her
large
black
kerchief
over
her
head
and
pinned
it
together
under
her
chin
when
she
came
back
to
marietta
room
her
mistress
was
wrapped
in
a
dark
mantle
that
covered
hear
thin
white
dress
entirely
and
one
corner
of
it
was
drawn
up
over
her
head
so
as
to
hide
her
hair
and
almost
all
her
face
she
was
waiting
by
the
door
i
am
going
with
you
she
said
and
her
voice
was
not
very
steady
but
you
will
be
seen
began
nella
by
the
porter
your
brother
may
see
you
he
is
welcome
come
we
are
losing
time
she
opened
the
door
and
went
out
quickly
i
shall
certainly
be
sent
away
for
letting
you
come
protested
nella
hurrying
after
her
marietta
did
not
even
answer
this
which
nella
thought
very
unkind
of
her
from
the
main
staircase
marietta
turned
off
at
the
first
landing
and
went
down
a
short
corridor
to
the
back
stairs
of
the
house
which
led
to
the
narrow
lane
beside
the
building
nella
snorted
softly
in
approval
for
she
had
feared
that
her
mistress
would
boldly
pass
through
the
hall
where
there
were
always
one
or
two
idle
in
waiting
the
front
door
was
closed
against
the
heat
they
had
met
no
one
and
they
reached
the
door
of
the
without
being
seen
pasquale
looked
at
marietta
but
said
nothing
until
all
three
were
inside
then
he
took
hold
of
marietta
mantle
at
her
elbow
and
held
her
back
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
in
amazement
you
must
not
go
in
lady
he
said
it
is
an
ugly
wound
to
see
marietta
pushed
him
aside
quietly
and
led
the
way
nella
followed
her
as
fast
as
she
could
and
pasquale
came
last
he
knew
that
the
two
women
would
need
help
zorzi
lay
quite
still
where
he
had
fallen
with
one
hand
on
the
billet
of
beech
wood
the
other
arm
doubled
under
him
his
cheek
on
the
dusty
stone
with
a
sharp
cry
marietta
ran
forward
and
knelt
beside
his
head
dropping
her
long
mantle
as
she
crossed
the
room
pasquale
uttered
an
uncompromising
exclamation
of
surprise
o
most
holy
mary
cried
nella
holding
up
her
hands
with
the
things
she
carried
marietta
believed
that
zorzi
was
dead
for
he
was
very
white
and
he
lay
quite
still
at
first
she
opened
her
eyes
wide
in
horror
but
in
a
moment
she
sank
down
covering
her
face
pasquale
knelt
opposite
her
on
one
knee
and
began
to
turn
zorzi
on
his
back
nella
was
at
his
feet
and
she
helped
with
great
gentleness
do
not
be
frightened
lady
said
pasquale
reassuringly
he
has
only
fainted
i
left
him
on
the
bench
but
you
see
he
must
have
tried
to
get
up
to
feed
the
fire
while
he
spoke
he
was
lifting
zorzi
as
well
as
he
could
marietta
dropped
her
hands
and
slowly
opened
her
eyes
and
she
knew
that
zorzi
was
alive
when
she
saw
his
face
though
it
was
ghastly
and
smeared
with
grey
ashes
but
in
those
few
moments
she
had
felt
what
she
could
never
forget
it
had
been
as
if
a
vast
had
severed
her
body
at
the
waist
and
yet
left
her
heart
alive
can
you
help
a
little
asked
pasquale
if
i
could
get
him
into
my
arms
i
could
carry
him
alone
marietta
sprang
to
her
feet
all
her
energy
and
strength
returning
in
a
moment
the
three
carried
the
unconscious
man
easily
enough
to
the
bench
and
laid
him
down
as
he
had
lain
before
with
his
head
on
the
leathern
cushion
then
nella
set
to
work
quickly
and
skilfully
for
she
hoped
to
dress
the
wound
while
he
was
still
insensible
marietta
helped
her
instinctively
doing
what
was
right
it
was
a
hideous
wound
it
will
heal
more
quickly
than
you
think
said
nella
confidently
the
burning
has
cauterised
it
marietta
delicately
reared
and
unused
to
such
sights
would
have
felt
faint
if
the
man
had
not
been
zorzi
as
it
was
she
only
felt
sharp
pain
each
time
that
nella
touched
the
foot
pasquale
looked
on
helpless
but
approving
zorzi
groaned
then
opened
his
eyes
and
moved
one
hand
nella
had
almost
finished
if
only
he
can
be
kept
quiet
a
few
moments
longer
she
said
it
will
be
well
done
zorzi
writhed
in
pain
only
half
conscious
yet
marietta
left
nella
to
put
on
the
last
bandages
and
came
and
looked
down
into
his
face
taking
one
of
his
hands
in
hers
he
recognised
her
and
stared
in
wild
surprise
you
must
try
and
not
move
she
said
softly
nella
has
almost
finished
he
forgot
what
he
suffered
and
the
agonised
contraction
of
his
brows
and
mouth
relaxed
marietta
wiped
away
the
ashes
from
his
forehead
and
cheeks
and
smoothed
back
his
thick
hair
no
woman
hand
had
touched
him
thus
since
his
mother
when
he
had
been
a
little
child
he
was
too
weak
to
question
what
was
happening
to
him
but
a
soft
light
came
into
his
eyes
and
he
unconsciously
pressed
marietta
hand
she
blushed
at
the
pressure
without
knowing
why
and
first
the
maiden
instinct
was
to
draw
away
her
hand
but
then
she
pitied
him
and
let
it
stay
she
thought
too
that
her
touch
helped
to
keep
him
quiet
and
indeed
it
did
how
did
you
know
he
asked
at
length
for
in
his
half
consciousness
it
had
seemed
natural
that
she
should
have
come
to
him
when
she
heard
that
he
was
hurt
pasquale
called
nella
she
answered
simply
and
i
came
too
is
the
pain
still
very
great
it
is
much
less
how
can
i
thank
you
she
looked
into
his
eyes
and
smiled
as
he
had
seen
her
smile
once
or
twice
before
in
his
life
his
memory
all
came
back
now
he
knew
that
she
ought
not
to
have
been
there
since
her
father
was
away
his
expression
changed
suddenly
what
is
the
matter
asked
marietta
does
it
hurt
very
much
no
he
said
i
was
thinking
he
checked
himself
and
glanced
at
the
porter
a
distant
knocking
was
heard
at
the
outer
door
pasquale
shuffled
off
to
see
who
was
there
i
will
wager
that
it
is
the
surgeon
he
grumbled
evil
befall
his
soul
we
do
not
want
him
what
were
you
going
to
say
asked
marietta
bending
down
there
is
only
nella
here
now
nella
should
not
have
let
you
come
said
zorzi
if
it
is
known
your
father
will
be
very
angry
ah
do
you
see
cried
nella
rising
for
she
had
finished
did
i
not
tell
you
so
my
pretty
lady
and
if
your
brother
finds
out
that
you
have
been
here
he
will
go
into
a
fury
like
a
wild
beast
i
told
you
so
and
as
for
your
help
indeed
i
could
have
brought
another
woman
and
there
was
pasquale
too
i
suppose
he
has
hands
oh
there
will
be
a
beautiful
revolution
in
the
house
when
this
is
known
but
marietta
did
not
mean
to
acknowledge
that
she
had
done
anything
but
what
was
perfectly
right
and
natural
under
the
circumstances
to
admit
that
would
have
been
to
confess
that
she
had
not
come
merely
out
of
pity
and
human
kindness
it
is
absurd
she
said
with
a
little
indignation
i
shall
tell
my
brother
myself
that
zorzi
was
hurt
and
that
i
helped
you
to
dress
his
wound
and
what
is
more
nella
you
will
have
to
come
again
and
i
shall
come
with
you
as
often
as
i
please
all
murano
may
know
it
for
anything
i
care
and
venice
too
asked
nella
shaking
her
head
in
disapproval
what
will
they
say
in
casa
contarini
when
they
hear
that
you
have
actually
gone
out
of
the
house
to
help
a
wounded
young
man
in
your
if
they
are
human
they
will
say
that
i
was
quite
right
answered
marietta
promptly
if
they
are
not
why
should
i
care
what
they
say
zorzi
smiled
at
that
moment
pasquale
passed
the
window
and
then
came
in
by
the
open
door
growling
his
ugly
face
was
transfigured
by
rage
until
it
had
a
sort
of
grotesque
grandeur
and
he
clenched
his
fist
as
he
began
to
speak
animals
beasts
brutes
worse
than
savages
he
was
almost
incoherent
well
what
has
happened
now
asked
nella
you
talk
like
a
mad
dog
remember
the
young
lady
it
would
make
a
leaden
statue
speak
answered
pasquale
the
signor
giovanni
sends
a
boy
to
say
that
the
surgeon
was
not
at
home
because
he
had
gone
to
shave
the
of
san
piero
in
spite
of
the
great
pain
he
still
suffered
zorzi
laughed
a
little
you
said
that
you
would
throw
him
into
the
canal
if
he
came
at
all
he
said
yes
and
so
i
meant
to
do
cried
pasquale
but
that
is
no
reason
why
the
inhuman
monster
should
be
shaving
the
when
a
man
might
be
dying
for
need
of
him
oh
let
him
come
here
oh
i
advise
him
to
come
the
miserable
cowardly
bloodletting
shaving
little
beast
of
a
barber
pasquale
drew
a
long
breath
after
this
and
unclenched
his
fist
but
his
lips
still
moved
as
he
said
things
to
himself
which
would
have
shocked
marietta
if
she
could
have
had
the
least
idea
of
what
they
meant
you
can
not
stay
here
she
said
turning
to
zorzi
again
you
can
not
lie
on
this
bench
all
day
i
shall
soon
be
able
to
stand
answered
zorzi
confidently
i
am
much
better
you
will
not
stand
on
that
foot
for
many
a
day
said
nella
shaking
her
head
then
pasquale
must
get
me
a
pair
of
crutches
replied
zorzi
i
can
not
lie
on
my
back
because
i
have
hurt
one
foot
i
must
tend
the
furnace
i
must
go
on
with
my
work
i
must
make
the
tests
i
must
he
stopped
short
and
bit
his
lip
turning
white
again
as
a
spasm
of
excruciating
pain
shot
along
his
right
side
from
his
foot
upwards
marietta
bent
over
him
full
of
anxiety
you
are
suffering
she
said
tenderly
you
must
not
try
to
move
it
is
nothing
he
answered
through
his
closed
teeth
it
will
pass
i
daresay
it
will
not
pass
said
nella
but
i
will
bring
you
some
syrup
of
poppies
that
will
make
you
sleep
marietta
seemed
to
feel
the
pain
herself
she
smoothed
the
leathern
cushion
under
his
head
as
well
as
she
could
and
softly
touched
his
forehead
it
was
hot
and
dry
now
he
is
feverish
she
said
to
nella
anxiously
i
will
bring
him
barley
water
with
the
syrup
of
poppies
what
do
you
expect
do
you
think
that
such
a
wound
and
such
a
burn
are
cooling
to
the
blood
and
refreshing
to
the
brain
the
man
is
badly
hurt
of
course
he
is
feverish
he
ought
to
be
in
his
bed
like
a
decent
christian
some
one
must
help
me
with
the
work
said
zorzi
faintly
there
is
no
one
but
me
answered
marietta
after
a
moment
pause
you
cried
nella
greatly
scandalised
even
pasquale
stared
at
marietta
in
silent
astonishment
yes
she
said
quietly
there
is
no
one
else
who
knows
enough
about
my
father
work
that
is
true
said
zorzi
but
you
can
not
come
here
and
work
with
me
marietta
turned
away
and
walked
to
the
window
in
her
thin
dress
she
stood
there
a
few
minutes
like
a
slender
lily
all
white
and
gold
in
the
summer
light
it
is
out
of
the
question
protested
nella
her
brother
will
never
allow
her
to
come
he
will
lock
her
up
in
her
own
room
for
safety
till
the
master
comes
home
i
think
i
shall
always
do
just
what
i
think
right
said
marietta
quietly
as
if
to
herself
lord
cried
nella
the
young
lady
is
going
mad
nella
was
gathering
together
the
remains
of
the
things
she
had
brought
exhausted
by
the
pain
he
had
suffered
and
by
the
efforts
he
had
made
to
hide
it
zorzi
lay
on
his
back
looking
with
eyes
at
the
graceful
outline
of
the
girl
figure
and
vaguely
wishing
that
she
would
never
move
and
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
die
while
quietly
gazing
at
her
lady
said
pasquale
at
last
and
rather
timidly
i
will
take
good
care
of
him
i
will
get
him
crutches
i
will
come
in
the
daytime
and
keep
the
fire
burning
for
him
it
would
be
far
better
to
let
it
go
out
observed
nella
with
much
sense
but
the
experiments
cried
zorzi
suddenly
coming
back
from
his
dream
i
have
promised
the
master
to
carry
them
out
you
see
what
comes
of
your
retorted
nella
pointing
to
his
bandaged
foot
how
did
it
happen
asked
marietta
suddenly
how
did
you
do
it
it
was
done
for
him
said
pasquale
and
may
the
last
judgment
come
a
hundred
times
over
for
him
who
did
it
his
intention
was
clearer
than
his
words
do
you
mean
that
it
was
done
on
purpose
out
of
spite
asked
marietta
looking
from
pasquale
to
zorzi
it
was
an
accident
said
the
latter
i
was
in
the
main
furnace
room
with
your
brother
the
with
the
hot
glass
slipped
from
a
hand
your
brother
saw
it
he
will
tell
you
i
have
been
porter
here
for
years
retorted
pasquale
and
there
have
been
several
accidents
in
that
time
but
i
never
heard
of
one
like
that
it
was
nothing
else
said
zorzi
his
voice
was
weak
nella
had
finished
collecting
her
belongings
marietta
saw
that
she
could
not
stay
any
longer
at
present
and
she
went
once
more
to
zorzi
side
let
pasquale
take
care
of
you
she
said
i
will
come
and
see
how
you
are
morning
i
thank
you
he
answered
i
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
i
have
no
words
to
tell
you
how
much
you
need
none
said
she
quietly
i
have
done
nothing
it
is
nella
who
has
helped
you
nella
knows
that
i
am
very
grateful
of
course
of
course
answered
the
woman
kindly
you
have
made
him
talk
too
much
she
added
speaking
to
marietta
let
us
go
away
i
must
prepare
the
barley
water
it
takes
a
long
time
is
he
to
have
nothing
but
barley
water
asked
pasquale
i
will
send
him
what
he
is
to
have
answered
nella
with
an
air
of
superiority
marietta
looked
back
at
zorzi
from
the
door
and
his
eyes
were
following
her
she
bent
her
head
gravely
and
went
out
followed
by
the
others
and
he
was
alone
again
but
it
was
very
different
now
the
spasms
of
pain
came
back
now
and
then
but
there
was
rest
between
them
for
there
was
a
potent
anodyne
in
the
balsam
with
which
nella
had
soaked
the
first
dressing
of
all
possible
hurts
the
pain
from
burning
is
the
most
acute
and
lasting
and
the
wise
little
woman
who
sometimes
seemed
so
foolish
had
done
all
that
science
could
have
done
for
zorzi
even
at
a
much
later
day
he
could
think
connectedly
now
he
had
been
able
to
talk
had
it
been
possible
for
him
to
stand
he
might
even
have
gone
on
for
a
time
with
the
preparations
for
the
next
experiment
yet
he
felt
an
instinctive
certainty
that
he
was
to
be
lame
for
life
he
was
not
thinking
of
the
experiments
just
then
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
marietta
four
or
five
days
had
passed
since
he
had
talked
with
her
in
the
garden
and
she
was
now
formally
promised
to
jacopo
contarini
he
wondered
why
she
had
come
with
nella
and
he
remembered
her
earnest
offer
of
friendship
she
meant
to
show
him
that
she
was
still
in
earnest
he
supposed
it
had
been
perfect
happiness
to
feel
her
cool
young
hand
on
his
forehead
to
press
it
in
his
own
no
one
could
take
that
from
him
as
long
as
he
lived
he
remembered
it
through
the
horrible
pain
it
had
soothed
and
it
was
better
than
the
touch
of
an
angel
for
it
was
the
touch
of
a
loving
woman
but
he
did
not
know
that
and
be
fancied
that
if
she
had
ever
guessed
that
he
loved
her
she
would
not
have
come
to
him
now
she
would
feel
that
the
mere
thought
in
his
heart
was
an
offence
and
besides
she
was
to
marry
contarini
and
she
was
not
of
the
kind
that
would
promise
to
marry
one
man
and
yet
encourage
love
in
another
it
was
well
thought
zorzi
that
she
had
never
suspected
the
truth
when
marietta
reached
her
room
again
she
listened
patiently
to
scolding
and
warning
for
she
did
not
hear
a
word
the
good
woman
said
to
her
nella
brushed
the
dust
from
the
silk
mantle
and
from
white
skirt
very
industriously
lest
it
should
betray
the
secret
to
giovanni
or
any
other
member
of
the
household
for
they
had
escaped
being
seen
even
when
they
came
back
nella
scolded
on
in
a
little
voice
with
many
rising
inflections
in
her
whole
life
she
said
she
had
never
connived
at
anything
more
utterly
shameless
than
this
she
was
humble
indeed
and
of
no
account
in
the
world
but
if
she
had
run
out
in
the
middle
of
the
day
to
visit
a
young
man
when
she
was
betrothed
to
her
poor
vito
blessed
soul
and
the
lord
remember
him
her
poor
vito
would
have
gone
to
her
father
might
the
lord
refresh
his
soul
and
would
have
said
what
ways
are
these
do
you
think
i
will
marry
a
girl
who
runs
about
in
this
fashion
that
was
what
vito
would
have
said
and
he
would
have
said
give
me
back
the
gold
things
i
gave
your
daughter
and
let
me
go
and
find
a
wife
who
does
not
run
about
the
city
and
it
would
have
been
well
said
did
marietta
suppose
that
an
educated
person
like
the
lord
jacopo
contarini
would
be
less
particular
about
his
bride
manners
than
that
good
soul
vito
not
that
vito
had
been
ignorant
nella
should
have
liked
any
one
to
dare
to
say
that
she
had
married
an
ignorant
man
and
so
forth
and
so
on
marietta
heard
the
voice
without
listening
to
the
words
and
the
gentle
tone
was
rather
soothing
than
otherwise
she
sat
by
the
window
with
her
bead
work
while
nella
talked
and
brushed
and
moved
about
the
room
making
imaginary
small
tasks
in
order
to
talk
the
more
but
marietta
threaded
the
red
and
blue
beads
and
fastened
them
in
patterns
upon
the
piece
of
stuff
she
was
ornamenting
and
when
nella
looked
at
her
every
now
and
then
she
seemed
quite
calm
and
indifferent
there
had
always
been
something
inscrutable
about
her
she
was
wondering
why
she
had
submitted
to
be
betrothed
to
contarini
when
she
loved
zorzi
and
the
answer
did
not
come
she
could
not
understand
why
it
was
that
although
she
loved
zorzi
with
all
her
heart
she
had
been
convinced
that
she
hated
him
during
four
long
miserable
days
then
too
it
was
very
strange
that
she
should
feel
happy
that
she
should
know
that
she
was
really
happy
her
heart
brimming
over
with
sunshine
and
joy
while
zorzi
whom
she
loved
was
lying
on
that
uncomfortable
bench
in
dreadful
pain
it
was
true
that
when
she
thought
of
his
wound
the
pain
ran
through
her
own
limbs
and
made
her
move
in
her
seat
but
the
next
moment
she
was
perfectly
happy
again
and
yet
was
displeased
with
herself
for
it
as
if
it
were
not
quite
right
nella
stood
still
at
last
close
to
her
and
spoke
to
her
so
directly
that
she
could
not
help
hearing
my
little
lady
said
the
woman
do
not
forget
that
the
women
are
coming
early
morning
to
show
you
the
stuffs
which
your
father
has
chosen
for
your
wedding
gown
yes
i
remember
marietta
laid
down
her
work
in
the
little
basket
of
beads
and
looked
away
towards
the
window
between
the
shutters
she
could
just
see
one
of
the
scarlet
flowers
of
the
sweet
geranium
waving
in
the
sunlight
it
was
true
the
women
were
coming
in
the
morning
to
begin
the
work
they
would
measure
her
and
cut
out
patterns
in
buckram
and
fit
them
on
her
making
her
stand
a
long
time
they
would
spread
out
silks
and
satins
on
the
bed
and
on
the
table
they
would
hold
them
up
and
make
long
draperies
with
them
and
make
the
light
flash
in
the
deep
folds
and
they
would
tell
her
how
beautiful
she
would
be
as
a
bride
and
that
her
skin
was
whiter
than
lilies
and
milk
and
snow
and
her
hair
finer
than
silk
and
richer
than
ropes
of
spun
red
gold
while
they
were
saying
those
things
she
would
look
very
grave
and
indifferent
and
nothing
they
could
show
her
would
make
her
open
her
eyes
wide
but
her
heart
would
laugh
long
and
sweetly
for
she
should
be
infinitely
happy
though
no
one
would
know
it
she
would
give
no
opinion
about
the
gown
no
matter
how
they
pressed
her
with
questions
after
that
the
pieces
that
were
to
be
embroidered
would
be
very
carefully
weighed
the
silk
and
the
satin
and
the
weights
of
the
pieces
would
be
written
down
also
each
of
the
hired
women
who
were
to
make
the
embroidery
would
receive
a
certain
amount
of
silver
and
gold
thread
of
which
the
weight
would
be
written
down
under
that
of
the
stuff
and
the
two
figures
added
together
would
mean
just
what
the
finished
piece
of
embroidery
ought
to
weigh
for
if
this
were
not
done
the
women
would
of
course
steal
the
gold
and
silver
thread
a
little
every
day
and
take
it
away
in
their
mouths
because
the
housekeeper
would
always
search
them
every
evening
in
spite
of
the
weighing
but
they
were
well
paid
for
the
work
and
did
not
object
to
being
suspected
for
it
was
part
of
their
business
in
time
marietta
would
go
to
see
the
work
they
were
doing
in
the
great
cool
loft
where
they
would
sit
all
day
where
the
linen
presses
stood
side
by
side
and
the
great
chests
which
held
the
hangings
and
curtains
and
carpets
that
were
used
on
great
occasions
the
housekeeper
had
her
little
room
up
there
and
could
watch
the
at
their
work
and
scold
them
if
they
were
idle
noting
how
much
should
be
taken
from
their
pay
the
women
would
sing
long
songs
answering
each
other
for
an
hour
at
a
time
but
no
one
would
hear
them
below
because
the
house
was
so
big
by
and
by
the
work
would
be
almost
finished
and
then
it
would
be
quite
done
and
the
wedding
day
would
be
very
near
there
marietta
vision
of
the
future
suddenly
came
to
a
climax
as
she
tried
to
imagine
what
would
happen
when
she
should
boldly
declare
that
neither
her
father
nor
the
council
of
ten
nor
the
doge
himself
nor
even
his
holiness
pope
paul
who
was
a
venetian
too
could
ever
make
her
marry
jacopo
contarini
there
would
be
such
a
convulsion
of
the
family
as
had
never
taken
place
since
she
was
born
in
her
imagination
she
fancied
all
murano
taking
sides
for
her
or
against
her
even
venice
itself
would
be
amazed
at
the
temerity
of
a
girl
who
dared
to
refuse
the
husband
her
father
had
chosen
for
her
it
would
be
an
outrage
on
all
authority
a
scandal
never
to
be
forgotten
an
rebellion
against
the
natural
law
by
which
unmarried
children
were
held
in
bondage
as
slaves
to
their
parents
but
marietta
was
not
frightened
by
the
tremendous
consequences
her
fancy
deduced
from
her
refusal
to
marry
she
was
happy
some
day
the
man
she
loved
would
know
that
she
had
faced
the
world
for
him
rather
than
be
bound
to
any
one
else
and
he
would
love
her
all
the
more
dearly
for
having
risked
so
much
she
had
never
been
so
happy
before
only
now
and
then
when
she
thought
of
zorzi
hurt
she
felt
a
sharp
thrill
of
pain
run
through
her
all
day
the
tide
of
joy
was
high
in
her
heart
towards
evening
she
sent
nella
over
to
the
to
see
how
zorzi
was
doing
and
as
soon
as
the
woman
was
gone
she
stood
at
the
open
window
behind
her
flowers
to
watch
her
go
in
pasquale
would
look
out
the
door
would
be
open
for
a
moment
she
would
be
a
little
nearer
even
in
that
small
anticipation
she
was
not
disappointed
it
was
a
new
joy
to
be
able
to
look
from
her
window
into
the
dark
entry
that
led
to
the
place
where
zorzi
was
or
the
next
day
he
would
perhaps
come
to
the
door
helped
by
pasquale
but
morning
she
would
go
and
see
him
come
what
might
she
was
not
afraid
of
her
brother
giovanni
and
it
might
be
long
before
her
father
came
back
till
then
at
all
events
she
would
do
what
she
thought
right
no
matter
how
nella
might
be
scandalised
nella
came
back
and
said
that
zorzi
was
better
that
he
had
slept
all
the
afternoon
and
now
had
very
little
pain
and
he
was
not
in
any
anxiety
about
the
furnace
for
pasquale
had
kept
the
fire
burning
properly
all
day
zorzi
had
begged
nella
to
deliver
a
message
of
thanks
try
and
remember
just
what
he
told
you
said
marietta
there
was
nothing
especial
answered
nella
with
exasperating
indifference
he
said
that
i
was
to
thank
you
very
much
something
like
that
nothing
else
i
am
sure
that
those
were
not
his
words
why
did
you
forget
them
if
it
had
been
an
account
of
money
spent
i
should
remember
it
exactly
answered
nella
a
pennyworth
of
thread
beeswax
a
farthing
so
much
for
needles
i
should
forget
nothing
but
when
a
man
says
thank
you
what
is
there
to
remember
but
you
are
never
satisfied
nella
may
work
her
hands
to
the
bone
for
you
nella
may
run
errands
for
you
till
she
is
lame
you
are
never
pleased
with
what
nella
does
it
is
always
the
same
she
tossed
her
brown
head
to
show
that
she
was
offended
but
marietta
laughed
softly
and
patted
the
little
woman
cheek
affectionately
you
are
a
dear
little
old
angel
she
said
nella
was
pacified
chapter
xi
the
porter
kept
his
word
and
took
good
care
of
zorzi
when
the
night
boys
had
come
he
carried
him
into
the
inner
room
and
put
him
to
bed
like
a
child
zorzi
asked
him
to
tell
the
boys
to
wake
him
at
the
watches
as
they
had
done
on
the
previous
night
and
pasquale
humoured
him
but
when
he
went
away
he
wisely
forgot
to
give
the
message
and
the
lads
who
knew
that
he
had
been
hurt
supposed
that
he
was
not
to
be
disturbed
it
was
broad
daylight
when
he
awoke
and
saw
pasquale
standing
beside
him
are
the
boys
gone
already
he
asked
almost
as
he
opened
his
eyes
no
they
are
all
asleep
in
a
corner
answered
the
porter
asleep
cried
zorzi
in
sudden
anxiety
wake
them
pasquale
and
see
whether
the
has
been
turned
and
is
running
and
whether
the
fire
is
burning
the
young
i
will
wake
them
answered
pasquale
i
supposed
that
they
were
allowed
to
sleep
after
daylight
a
moment
later
zorzi
heard
him
apostrophising
the
three
lads
with
his
usual
vigour
of
language
judging
from
the
sounds
that
accompanied
the
words
he
was
encouraging
their
movements
by
other
means
also
presently
one
of
the
three
set
up
a
howl
oh
you
sons
of
snails
and
codfish
i
will
teach
you
growled
pasquale
and
he
proceeded
to
teach
them
till
they
were
all
three
howling
at
once
zorzi
knew
that
they
deserved
a
beating
but
he
was
naturally
pasquale
he
called
out
let
them
alone
let
them
make
up
the
fire
pasquale
came
back
and
the
yells
subsided
i
have
knocked
their
empty
heads
together
he
observed
they
will
not
sleep
for
a
week
yes
the
has
run
out
but
the
fire
is
not
very
low
i
will
bring
you
water
and
when
you
are
dressed
i
will
carry
you
out
into
the
laboratory
the
boys
did
not
dare
to
go
away
till
they
had
made
up
the
fire
then
they
took
themselves
off
and
as
pasquale
let
them
out
he
treated
them
to
a
final
expression
of
his
opinion
the
tallest
of
the
three
was
bleeding
from
his
nose
which
had
been
brought
into
violent
conjunction
with
the
skull
of
one
of
his
companions
when
the
door
was
shut
and
they
had
gone
a
few
steps
along
the
footway
he
stopped
the
others
we
are
sons
he
said
and
we
have
been
beaten
by
that
swine
of
a
porter
let
us
be
revenged
on
him
even
zorzi
would
not
have
dared
to
touch
us
because
he
is
a
foreigner
we
can
do
nothing
answered
the
smallest
boy
disconsolately
if
i
tell
my
father
that
we
went
to
sleep
he
will
say
that
the
porter
served
us
right
and
i
shall
get
another
beating
you
are
cowards
said
the
first
speaker
but
i
am
wounded
he
continued
proudly
pointing
to
his
nose
i
will
go
to
the
master
and
ask
redress
i
will
sit
down
before
the
door
and
wait
for
him
do
what
you
please
returned
the
others
we
will
go
home
you
have
no
spirit
of
honour
in
you
said
the
tall
boy
contemptuously
he
turned
his
back
on
them
in
disdain
crossed
the
bridge
and
sat
down
under
the
covered
way
in
front
of
beroviero
house
he
smeared
the
blood
over
his
face
till
he
really
looked
as
if
he
might
be
badly
hurt
and
he
kept
up
a
low
tremulous
moaning
his
nose
really
hurt
him
and
as
he
was
extremely
sorry
for
himself
some
real
tears
came
into
his
eyes
now
and
then
he
waited
a
long
time
the
front
door
was
opened
and
two
men
came
out
with
brooms
and
began
to
sweep
when
they
saw
him
they
were
for
making
him
go
away
but
he
cried
out
that
he
was
waiting
for
the
signor
giovanni
to
show
him
how
a
free
son
had
been
treated
by
a
dog
of
a
foreigner
and
a
swine
of
a
porter
over
there
in
the
then
the
servants
let
him
stay
for
they
feared
the
porter
and
hated
zorzi
for
being
a
dalmatian
at
last
giovanni
came
out
and
the
boy
at
once
uttered
a
particularly
effective
moan
giovanni
stopped
and
looked
at
him
and
he
gulped
and
sobbed
vigorously
get
up
and
go
away
at
once
said
giovanni
much
disgusted
by
the
sight
of
the
blood
i
will
not
go
till
you
hear
me
sir
answered
the
boy
dramatically
i
am
a
free
son
and
i
have
been
beaten
like
this
by
the
porter
of
the
this
is
the
way
we
are
treated
though
we
work
to
learn
the
art
as
our
fathers
worked
before
us
you
probably
went
to
sleep
you
little
wretch
observed
giovanni
get
out
of
my
way
and
go
home
justice
sir
justice
moaned
the
boy
dropping
himself
on
his
knees
nonsense
go
away
giovanni
pushed
him
aside
and
began
to
walk
on
the
boy
sprang
up
and
followed
him
and
running
beside
him
as
giovanni
tried
to
get
away
touched
the
skirt
of
his
coat
respectfully
and
then
kissed
the
back
of
his
own
hand
if
you
will
listen
to
me
sir
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
will
tell
you
something
you
wish
to
know
giovanni
stopped
short
and
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
i
will
tell
you
of
something
the
master
did
on
the
sunday
night
before
he
went
on
his
journey
continued
the
lad
i
am
one
of
the
night
boys
in
the
laboratory
and
i
saw
with
my
eyes
while
the
others
were
asleep
for
we
had
been
told
to
wait
till
we
were
called
giovanni
looked
about
to
see
whether
any
one
was
within
hearing
they
were
still
in
the
covered
footway
above
which
the
first
story
of
the
house
was
built
but
were
near
the
end
and
the
shutters
of
the
lower
windows
were
closed
tell
me
what
you
saw
said
giovanni
but
do
not
speak
loud
at
this
moment
the
other
two
boys
came
running
up
with
noisy
lamentations
with
the
wisdom
of
their
kind
they
had
patiently
watched
to
see
whether
their
companion
would
get
a
hearing
of
the
master
and
judging
that
he
had
been
successful
at
last
they
came
to
enjoy
the
fruit
of
his
efforts
we
also
have
been
beaten
they
wailed
but
they
bore
no
outward
and
visible
signs
of
on
them
the
elder
boy
turned
upon
them
with
righteous
fury
and
to
their
unspeakable
surprise
began
to
drive
them
away
with
kicks
and
blows
they
could
not
stand
against
him
and
after
a
brief
resistance
they
turned
and
ran
at
full
speed
the
victor
came
back
to
giovanni
side
they
are
cowardly
fellows
he
said
with
disdain
they
are
ignorant
boys
what
do
you
expect
but
they
will
not
come
back
go
on
with
your
story
said
giovanni
impatiently
but
speak
low
it
was
on
sunday
night
sir
the
master
came
to
talk
with
zorzi
in
the
laboratory
i
was
in
the
garden
at
the
entrance
of
the
other
passage
when
the
door
opened
there
was
not
much
light
and
the
master
was
wrapped
in
his
cloak
and
he
turned
a
little
and
went
in
sideways
so
i
knew
that
he
had
something
under
his
arm
for
the
door
is
narrow
he
was
probably
bringing
over
some
valuable
materials
said
giovanni
i
believe
he
was
bringing
the
great
book
said
the
boy
confidently
but
almost
in
a
whisper
what
great
book
the
lad
looked
at
giovanni
with
an
expression
of
cunning
on
his
face
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
was
not
to
be
deceived
by
such
a
transparent
pretence
of
ignorance
he
was
afraid
to
leave
it
in
his
house
he
said
lest
you
should
find
it
and
learn
how
to
make
the
gold
as
he
does
so
he
took
it
over
to
the
laboratory
at
night
giovanni
began
to
understand
though
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
heard
that
the
boys
like
the
common
people
suspected
angelo
beroviero
of
being
an
alchemist
it
was
clear
that
the
boy
meant
the
book
that
contained
the
priceless
secrets
for
which
giovanni
and
his
brother
had
so
long
coveted
his
interest
increased
after
all
he
said
you
saw
nothing
distinctly
my
father
went
in
and
shut
the
door
i
suppose
yes
answered
the
boy
but
after
a
long
time
the
door
opened
again
he
stopped
resolved
to
be
questioned
in
order
that
his
information
should
seem
more
valuable
the
instinct
of
small
boys
is
often
as
diabolically
keen
as
that
of
a
grown
woman
go
on
said
giovanni
more
and
more
interested
the
door
opened
again
you
say
then
my
father
came
out
no
sir
zorzi
came
out
into
the
light
that
fell
from
the
door
the
master
was
inside
well
what
did
zorzi
do
be
quick
he
brought
out
a
shovel
full
of
earth
sir
and
he
carefully
scattered
it
about
over
the
and
then
he
went
back
and
presently
he
came
out
with
the
shovel
again
and
more
earth
and
so
three
times
they
had
buried
the
great
book
somewhere
in
the
laboratory
but
the
laboratory
is
paved
objected
giovanni
to
gain
time
for
he
was
thinking
there
is
earth
under
the
stones
sir
i
remember
seeing
it
last
year
when
the
masons
put
down
several
new
slabs
the
great
book
is
somewhere
under
the
floor
of
the
laboratory
i
must
have
stepped
over
it
in
feeding
the
fire
last
night
and
that
is
why
the
devils
that
guard
it
inspired
the
porter
to
beat
me
this
morning
it
was
the
devils
that
sent
us
to
sleep
for
fear
that
we
should
find
it
i
daresay
said
giovanni
with
much
gravity
for
he
thought
it
better
that
the
boy
should
be
kept
in
awe
of
an
object
that
possessed
such
immense
value
you
should
be
careful
in
future
or
ill
may
befall
you
is
it
true
sir
that
i
have
told
you
something
you
wished
to
know
i
am
glad
to
know
that
the
great
book
is
safe
answered
giovanni
ambiguously
zorzi
knows
where
it
is
suggested
the
boy
in
a
tone
meant
to
convey
the
suspicion
that
zorzi
might
use
his
knowledge
yes
yes
repeated
giovanni
thoughtfully
and
he
is
ill
he
ought
to
be
brought
over
to
the
house
until
he
is
better
then
the
furnace
could
be
allowed
to
get
out
sir
could
it
not
yes
the
weather
is
growing
warm
as
it
is
yes
the
furnace
may
be
put
out
now
giovanni
hardly
knew
that
he
was
speaking
aloud
zorzi
will
get
well
much
sooner
if
he
is
in
a
good
room
in
the
house
i
will
see
to
it
the
boy
stood
still
beside
him
waiting
patiently
for
some
reward
are
we
to
come
as
usual
sir
or
will
there
be
no
fire
he
asked
go
and
ask
at
the
usual
time
i
have
not
decided
yet
there
you
are
a
good
boy
if
you
hold
your
tongue
there
will
be
more
giovanni
offered
the
lad
a
piece
of
money
but
he
would
not
take
it
we
are
sons
sir
we
are
not
poor
people
he
said
with
theatrical
pride
for
he
would
have
taken
the
coin
without
remark
if
he
had
not
felt
that
he
possessed
a
secret
of
great
value
which
might
place
giovanni
in
his
power
before
long
giovanni
was
surprised
what
do
you
want
then
he
asked
i
am
old
enough
to
be
an
apprentice
sir
very
well
answered
giovanni
you
shall
be
an
apprentice
but
hold
your
tongue
about
what
you
saw
you
told
me
everything
did
you
yes
sir
and
i
thank
you
for
your
kindness
sir
if
i
can
help
you
sir
he
stopped
help
me
exclaimed
giovanni
i
do
not
work
at
the
furnaces
wash
your
face
and
come
by
and
by
to
my
and
you
shall
have
an
apprentice
place
i
shall
serve
you
well
sir
you
shall
see
that
i
am
grateful
answered
the
boy
he
touched
giovanni
sleeve
and
kissed
his
own
hand
and
ran
back
to
the
steps
before
the
front
door
there
he
knelt
down
leaning
over
the
water
and
washed
his
face
in
the
canal
well
pleased
with
the
price
he
had
got
for
his
bruising
giovanni
did
not
look
at
him
but
turned
to
go
on
past
the
corner
of
the
house
in
deep
thought
from
the
narrow
line
into
which
the
back
door
opened
marietta
and
nella
emerged
at
the
same
moment
nella
had
made
sure
that
giovanni
had
gone
out
but
she
could
not
foresee
that
he
would
stop
a
long
time
to
talk
with
the
boy
in
the
covered
footway
she
ran
against
him
as
he
passed
the
corner
for
she
was
walking
on
marietta
left
side
the
young
girl
face
was
covered
but
she
knew
that
giovanni
must
recognise
her
instantly
by
her
cloak
and
because
nella
was
with
her
where
are
you
going
he
asked
sharply
to
church
sir
to
church
answered
nella
in
great
perturbation
the
young
lady
is
going
to
confession
ah
very
good
very
good
exclaimed
giovanni
who
was
very
attentive
to
religious
forms
by
all
means
go
to
confession
my
sister
you
can
not
be
too
conscientious
in
the
performance
of
your
duties
but
marietta
laughed
a
little
under
her
veil
i
had
not
the
least
intention
of
going
to
confession
this
morning
she
said
nella
said
so
because
you
frightened
her
what
what
is
this
giovanni
looked
from
one
to
the
other
then
where
are
you
going
to
the
answered
marietta
with
perfect
coolness
you
are
not
going
to
the
laboratory
zorzi
is
living
there
alone
you
can
not
go
there
i
am
not
afraid
of
zorzi
in
the
first
place
i
wish
to
know
how
he
is
secondly
this
is
the
hour
for
making
the
tests
and
as
he
can
not
stand
he
can
not
try
the
glass
alone
giovanni
was
amazed
at
her
assurance
and
immediately
assumed
a
grave
and
authoritative
manner
befitting
the
eldest
brother
who
represented
the
head
of
the
house
i
can
not
allow
you
to
go
he
said
it
is
most
unbecoming
our
father
would
be
shocked
go
back
at
once
and
never
think
of
going
to
the
laboratory
while
zorzi
is
there
do
you
hear
yes
come
nella
she
added
taking
her
by
the
arm
before
giovanni
realised
what
she
was
going
to
do
she
was
walking
quickly
across
the
wooden
bridge
towards
the
holding
nella
sleeve
to
keep
her
from
lagging
and
nella
trotted
beside
her
mistress
like
a
frightened
lamb
led
by
a
string
giovanni
did
not
attempt
to
follow
at
first
for
he
was
utterly
nonplussed
by
his
sister
behaviour
he
rarely
knew
what
to
do
when
any
one
openly
defied
him
he
stood
still
staring
after
the
two
and
saw
marietta
tap
upon
the
door
of
the
it
opened
almost
immediately
and
they
disappeared
within
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
sight
his
anger
broke
out
and
he
made
a
few
quick
steps
on
the
bridge
then
he
stopped
for
he
was
afraid
to
make
a
scandal
that
at
least
was
what
he
said
to
himself
but
the
fact
was
that
he
was
afraid
to
face
his
sister
who
was
infinitely
braver
and
cooler
than
he
besides
he
reflected
that
he
could
not
now
prevent
her
from
going
to
the
laboratory
since
she
was
already
there
and
that
it
would
be
very
undignified
to
make
a
scene
before
zorzi
who
was
only
a
servant
after
all
this
last
consideration
consoled
him
greatly
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
and
therefore
in
giovanni
zorzi
was
a
hired
servant
now
socially
speaking
a
servant
was
not
a
man
and
since
zorzi
was
not
a
man
and
marietta
was
therefore
gone
with
one
servant
to
a
place
belonging
to
her
father
where
there
was
another
servant
to
go
thither
and
forcibly
bring
her
back
would
either
be
absurd
or
else
it
would
mean
that
zorzi
had
acquired
a
new
social
rank
which
was
absurd
also
there
is
no
such
consolation
to
a
born
coward
as
a
logical
reason
for
not
doing
what
he
is
afraid
to
do
but
giovanni
promised
himself
that
he
would
make
his
sister
pay
dearly
for
having
defied
him
and
as
he
had
also
made
up
his
mind
to
have
zorzi
removed
to
the
house
on
pretence
of
curing
his
hurt
but
in
reality
in
order
to
search
for
the
precious
manuscripts
it
would
be
impossible
for
marietta
to
commit
the
same
piece
of
folly
a
second
time
but
she
should
pay
for
the
affront
she
had
put
upon
him
he
accordingly
came
back
to
the
footway
and
walked
along
toward
his
own
and
the
boy
who
had
finished
washing
his
face
smoothed
his
hair
with
his
wet
fingers
and
followed
him
having
seen
and
understood
all
that
had
happened
marietta
sent
pasquale
on
to
tell
zorzi
that
she
was
coming
and
when
she
reached
the
laboratory
he
was
sitting
in
the
master
big
chair
with
his
foot
on
a
stool
before
him
his
face
was
pale
and
drawn
from
the
suffering
of
the
past
hours
and
from
time
to
time
he
was
still
in
great
pain
as
marietta
entered
he
looked
up
with
a
grateful
smile
you
seem
glad
to
see
us
after
all
she
said
yet
you
protested
that
i
should
not
come
i
can
not
help
it
he
answered
ah
but
if
you
had
been
with
us
just
now
nella
began
still
frightened
but
marietta
would
not
let
her
go
on
hold
your
tongue
nella
she
said
with
a
little
laugh
you
should
know
better
than
to
trouble
a
sick
man
fancy
with
such
stories
nella
understood
that
zorzi
was
not
to
know
and
she
began
examining
the
foot
to
make
sure
that
the
bandages
had
not
been
displaced
during
the
night
i
will
change
them
she
said
it
is
not
like
a
scald
the
glass
has
burned
you
like
iron
and
the
wound
will
heal
quickly
if
you
will
tell
me
which
crucible
to
try
said
marietta
i
will
make
the
tests
for
you
then
we
can
move
the
table
to
your
side
and
you
can
prepare
the
new
ingredients
according
to
the
writing
pasquale
had
left
them
seeing
that
he
was
not
wanted
i
fear
it
is
of
little
use
answered
zorzi
despondently
of
course
the
master
is
very
wise
but
it
seems
to
me
that
he
has
added
so
much
from
time
to
time
to
the
original
mixture
and
so
much
has
been
taken
away
as
to
make
it
all
very
uncertain
i
daresay
assented
marietta
for
some
time
i
have
thought
so
but
we
must
carry
out
his
wishes
to
the
letter
else
he
will
always
believe
that
the
experiments
might
have
succeeded
if
he
had
stayed
here
of
course
said
zorzi
we
should
make
tests
of
all
three
crucibles
if
it
is
only
to
make
more
room
for
the
things
that
are
to
be
put
in
where
is
the
copper
ladle
asked
marietta
i
do
not
see
it
in
its
place
i
have
none
i
had
forgotten
your
brother
came
here
yesterday
morning
and
wanted
to
try
the
glass
himself
in
spite
of
me
i
knocked
the
ladle
out
of
his
hand
and
it
fell
through
into
the
crucible
that
was
like
you
said
marietta
i
am
glad
you
did
it
heaven
knows
what
has
happened
to
the
thing
zorzi
answered
it
has
been
there
since
yesterday
morning
for
all
i
know
it
may
have
melted
by
this
time
it
may
affect
the
glass
too
where
can
i
get
another
asked
marietta
anxious
to
begin
zorzi
made
an
instinctive
motion
to
rise
it
hurt
him
badly
and
he
bit
his
lip
i
forgot
he
said
pasquale
can
get
another
ladle
from
the
main
go
and
call
pasquale
nella
said
marietta
at
once
ask
him
to
get
a
copper
ladle
nella
went
out
into
the
garden
leaving
the
two
together
marietta
was
standing
between
the
chair
and
the
furnace
two
or
three
steps
from
zorzi
it
was
very
hot
in
the
big
room
for
the
window
was
still
shut
tell
me
how
you
really
feel
marietta
said
almost
at
once
every
woman
who
loves
a
man
and
is
anxious
about
him
is
sure
that
if
she
can
be
alone
with
him
for
a
moment
he
will
tell
her
the
truth
about
his
condition
the
experience
of
thousands
of
years
has
not
taught
women
that
if
there
is
one
person
in
the
world
from
whom
a
man
will
try
to
conceal
his
ills
and
aches
it
is
the
woman
he
loves
because
he
would
rather
suffer
everything
than
give
her
pain
i
feel
perfectly
well
said
zorzi
indeed
you
are
not
answered
marietta
energetically
if
you
were
perfectly
well
you
would
be
on
your
feet
doing
your
work
yourself
why
will
you
not
tell
me
i
mean
i
have
no
pain
said
zorzi
you
had
great
pain
just
now
when
you
tried
to
move
retorted
marietta
you
know
it
why
do
you
try
to
deceive
me
do
you
think
i
can
not
see
it
in
your
face
it
is
nothing
it
comes
now
and
then
and
goes
away
again
almost
at
once
marietta
had
come
close
to
him
while
she
was
speaking
one
hand
hung
by
her
side
within
his
reach
he
longed
to
take
it
with
such
a
longing
as
he
had
never
felt
for
anything
in
his
life
he
resisted
with
all
the
strength
he
had
left
but
he
remembered
that
he
had
held
her
hand
in
his
yesterday
and
the
memory
was
a
force
in
itself
outside
of
him
drawing
him
in
spite
of
himself
lifting
his
arm
when
he
commanded
it
to
lie
still
his
eyes
could
not
take
themselves
from
the
beautiful
white
fingers
so
delicately
curved
as
they
hung
down
so
softly
shaded
to
pale
rose
colour
at
their
tapering
tips
she
stood
quite
still
looking
down
at
his
bent
head
you
would
not
refuse
my
friendship
now
she
said
in
a
low
voice
so
low
that
when
she
had
spoken
she
doubted
whether
he
could
have
understood
he
took
her
hand
then
for
he
had
no
resistance
left
and
she
let
him
take
it
and
did
not
blush
he
held
it
in
both
his
own
and
silently
drew
it
to
him
till
he
was
pressing
it
to
his
heart
as
he
had
never
hoped
to
do
you
are
too
good
to
me
he
said
scarcely
knowing
that
he
pronounced
the
words
nella
passed
the
window
coming
back
from
her
errand
instantly
marietta
drew
her
hand
away
and
when
the
entered
she
was
speaking
to
zorzi
in
the
most
natural
tone
in
the
world
is
the
testing
plate
quite
clean
she
asked
and
she
was
already
beside
it
zorzi
looked
at
her
with
amazement
she
had
almost
been
seen
with
her
hand
in
his
a
catastrophe
which
he
supposed
would
have
entailed
the
most
serious
consequences
yet
there
she
was
perfectly
unconcerned
and
not
even
faintly
blushing
and
she
had
at
once
pretended
that
they
had
been
talking
about
the
glass
yes
i
believe
it
is
clean
he
answered
almost
hesitating
i
cleaned
it
yesterday
morning
nella
had
brought
the
copper
ladle
there
were
always
several
in
the
for
making
tests
marietta
took
it
and
went
to
the
furnace
while
nella
watched
her
in
great
fear
lest
she
should
burn
herself
but
the
young
girl
was
in
no
danger
for
she
had
spent
half
her
life
in
the
laboratory
and
the
garden
watching
her
father
she
wrapped
the
wet
cloth
round
her
hand
and
held
the
ladle
by
the
end
we
will
begin
with
the
one
on
the
right
she
said
thrusting
the
instrument
through
the
aperture
bringing
it
out
with
some
glass
in
it
she
supported
it
with
both
hands
as
she
went
quickly
to
the
iron
table
and
she
instantly
poured
out
the
stuff
and
began
to
watch
it
it
is
just
what
you
had
the
other
day
she
said
as
the
glass
rapidly
cooled
zorzi
was
seated
high
enough
to
look
over
the
table
another
failure
he
said
it
is
always
the
same
we
have
scarcely
had
any
variation
in
the
tint
in
the
last
week
that
is
not
your
fault
answered
marietta
we
will
try
the
next
as
if
she
had
been
at
the
work
all
her
life
she
chilled
the
ladle
and
chipped
off
the
small
adhering
bits
of
glass
from
it
and
slipped
the
last
test
from
the
table
carrying
it
to
the
refuse
jar
with
tongs
once
more
she
wrapped
the
damp
cloth
round
her
hand
and
went
to
the
furnace
the
middle
crucible
was
to
be
tried
next
nella
looking
on
with
nervous
anxiety
was
in
a
profuse
perspiration
i
believe
that
is
the
one
into
which
the
ladle
fell
said
zorzi
yes
i
am
quite
sure
of
it
marietta
took
the
specimen
and
poured
it
out
set
down
the
ladle
on
the
brick
work
and
watched
the
cooling
glass
expecting
to
see
what
she
had
often
seen
before
but
her
face
changed
in
a
look
of
wonder
and
delight
zorzi
she
exclaimed
look
look
see
what
a
colour
i
can
not
see
well
he
answered
straining
his
neck
wait
a
minute
he
cried
as
marietta
took
the
tongs
i
see
now
we
have
got
it
i
believe
we
have
got
it
oh
if
i
could
only
walk
patience
you
shall
see
it
it
is
almost
cool
it
is
quite
stiff
now
she
took
the
little
flat
cake
up
with
the
tongs
very
carefully
and
held
it
before
his
eyes
the
light
fell
through
it
from
the
window
and
her
head
was
close
to
his
as
they
both
looked
at
it
together
i
never
dreamed
of
such
a
colour
said
zorzi
his
face
flushing
with
excitement
there
never
was
such
a
colour
before
answered
marietta
it
is
like
the
juice
of
a
ripe
pomegranate
that
has
just
been
cut
only
there
is
more
light
in
it
it
is
like
a
great
ruby
the
rubies
that
the
jewellers
call
blood
my
father
always
said
it
should
be
said
marietta
but
i
thought
he
meant
something
different
something
more
scarlet
i
thought
so
too
what
they
call
pigeon
blood
is
not
the
colour
of
blood
at
all
it
is
more
like
pomegranates
as
you
said
at
first
but
this
is
a
marvellous
thing
the
master
will
be
pleased
nella
came
and
looked
too
convinced
that
the
glass
had
in
some
way
turned
out
more
beautiful
by
the
magic
of
her
mistress
touch
it
is
a
miracle
cried
the
woman
of
the
people
some
saint
must
have
made
this
the
glass
glowed
like
a
gem
and
seemed
to
give
out
light
of
its
own
as
zorzi
and
marietta
looked
its
rich
glow
spread
over
their
faces
it
was
that
rare
glass
which
from
old
cathedral
windows
casts
such
a
deep
stain
upon
the
pavement
that
one
would
believe
the
marble
itself
must
be
dyed
with
unchanging
color
we
have
found
it
together
said
marietta
zorzi
looked
from
the
glass
to
her
face
close
by
his
and
their
eyes
met
for
a
moment
in
the
strange
glow
and
it
was
as
if
they
knew
each
other
in
another
world
do
not
let
the
red
light
fall
on
your
faces
said
nella
crossing
herself
it
is
too
much
like
blood
good
health
to
you
she
added
quickly
for
fear
of
evil
marietta
lowered
her
hand
and
turned
the
piece
of
glass
sideways
to
see
how
it
would
look
what
shall
we
do
with
it
she
asked
it
must
not
be
left
any
longer
in
the
crucible
no
it
ought
to
be
taken
out
at
once
such
a
colour
must
be
kept
for
church
windows
if
i
were
able
to
stand
i
would
make
most
of
it
into
cylinders
and
cut
them
while
hot
there
are
men
who
can
do
it
in
the
but
the
master
does
not
want
them
here
we
had
better
let
the
fires
go
out
said
marietta
it
will
cool
in
the
crucible
as
it
is
i
would
give
anything
to
have
that
crucible
empty
or
an
empty
one
in
the
place
answered
zorzi
this
is
a
great
discovery
but
it
is
not
exactly
what
the
master
expected
i
have
an
idea
of
my
own
which
i
should
like
to
try
then
we
must
empty
the
crucible
there
is
no
other
way
the
glass
will
keep
its
colour
whatever
shape
we
give
it
is
there
much
of
it
there
may
be
twenty
or
thirty
pounds
weight
answered
zorzi
no
one
can
tell
nell
listened
in
mute
surprise
she
had
never
seen
marietta
with
old
beroviero
and
she
was
amazed
to
hear
her
young
mistress
talking
about
the
processes
of
about
crucibles
and
cylinders
and
ingredients
as
familiarly
as
of
domestic
things
she
suddenly
began
to
imagine
that
old
beroviero
who
was
probably
a
magician
and
an
alchemist
had
taught
his
daughter
the
same
dangerous
knowledge
and
she
felt
a
sort
of
awe
before
the
two
young
people
who
knew
such
a
vast
deal
which
she
herself
could
never
know
she
asked
herself
what
was
to
become
of
this
wonderful
girl
half
woman
and
half
enchantress
who
brought
the
colour
of
the
saints
blood
out
of
the
white
flames
and
understood
as
much
as
men
did
of
the
art
which
was
almost
all
made
up
of
secrets
what
would
happen
when
she
was
the
wife
of
jacopo
contarini
shut
up
in
a
splendid
venetian
palace
where
there
were
no
glass
furnaces
to
amuse
her
at
first
she
would
grow
pale
thought
nella
but
by
and
by
would
weave
spells
in
her
chamber
which
would
bring
all
venice
to
her
will
and
turn
it
all
to
gold
and
precious
stones
and
red
glass
and
the
people
to
fairies
subject
to
her
will
her
husband
the
council
of
ten
even
the
doge
himself
nella
roused
herself
and
passed
her
hand
over
her
eyes
as
if
she
were
waking
from
a
dream
and
indeed
she
had
been
dreaming
for
she
had
looked
too
long
into
the
wonderful
depths
of
the
new
colour
and
it
had
dazed
her
wits
chapter
xii
on
that
day
marietta
felt
once
more
the
full
belief
that
zorzi
loved
her
but
the
certainty
did
not
fill
her
with
happiness
as
on
that
first
afternoon
when
she
had
seen
him
stoop
to
pick
up
the
rose
she
had
dropped
the
time
that
had
seemed
so
very
distant
had
come
indeed
instead
of
years
a
week
had
scarcely
passed
and
it
was
not
by
letting
a
flower
fall
in
his
path
that
she
had
told
him
her
love
as
she
had
meant
to
do
she
had
done
much
more
she
had
let
him
take
her
hand
and
press
it
to
his
heart
and
she
would
have
left
it
there
if
nella
had
not
passed
the
window
she
had
wished
him
to
take
it
she
had
let
it
hang
by
her
side
in
the
hope
that
he
would
be
bold
enough
to
do
so
and
she
had
thrilled
with
delight
at
his
touch
she
had
drawn
back
her
hand
when
the
woman
came
and
she
had
put
on
a
look
of
innocent
indifference
that
would
have
deceived
one
of
the
council
own
spies
could
any
language
have
been
more
plain
it
was
very
strange
she
thought
that
she
should
all
at
once
have
gone
so
far
that
she
should
have
felt
such
undreamt
joy
at
the
moment
and
then
when
it
was
hers
a
part
of
her
life
which
nothing
could
ever
undo
nor
take
from
her
it
was
stranger
still
that
the
remembrance
of
this
wonderful
joy
should
make
her
suddenly
sad
and
thoughtful
that
she
should
lie
awake
at
night
wishing
that
it
had
never
been
and
tormenting
herself
with
the
idea
that
she
had
done
an
almost
irretrievable
wrong
at
the
very
moment
when
the
coming
day
was
breaking
upon
her
heart
twilight
a
wall
of
darkness
arose
between
her
and
the
future
much
that
is
very
good
and
true
in
the
world
is
built
upon
the
fanciful
fears
of
evil
that
warn
girls
hearts
of
harm
there
are
dangers
that
can
not
be
exaggerated
because
the
value
of
what
they
threaten
can
not
be
reckoned
too
great
so
long
as
human
goodness
rests
on
the
dangerous
quicksands
of
human
nature
marietta
had
not
realised
what
it
meant
to
be
betrothed
to
jacopo
contarini
until
she
had
let
her
hand
linger
in
zorzi
but
after
that
one
hour
had
not
passed
before
she
felt
that
she
was
living
between
two
alternatives
that
seemed
almost
equally
terrible
and
of
which
she
must
choose
the
one
or
the
other
within
two
months
she
must
either
marry
contarini
and
never
see
zorzi
again
or
she
must
refuse
to
be
married
and
face
the
tremendous
consequences
of
her
wilfulness
her
father
anger
the
just
resentment
of
all
the
contarini
family
the
humiliation
which
her
brothers
would
heap
upon
her
because
in
the
code
of
those
days
she
would
have
brought
shame
on
them
and
theirs
in
those
times
such
results
were
very
real
and
inevitable
when
a
girl
formal
promise
of
marriage
was
broken
though
she
herself
might
never
have
been
consulted
it
was
no
wonder
that
marietta
was
sleepless
at
night
and
spent
long
hours
of
the
day
sitting
listless
by
her
window
without
so
much
as
threading
a
score
of
beads
from
the
little
basket
that
stood
beside
her
nella
came
and
went
often
looked
at
her
and
shook
her
head
with
a
wise
smile
it
is
the
thought
of
marriage
said
the
woman
of
the
people
to
herself
she
pines
and
grows
pale
now
because
she
is
thinking
that
she
must
leave
her
father
house
so
soon
and
she
is
afraid
to
go
among
strangers
but
she
will
be
happy
by
and
by
like
the
swallows
in
spring
nella
remembered
how
frightened
she
herself
had
been
when
she
was
betrothed
to
her
departed
vito
and
she
was
thereby
much
comforted
as
to
marietta
condition
but
she
said
nothing
after
marietta
had
coldly
repelled
her
first
attempt
to
talk
of
the
marriage
though
she
forgave
her
mistress
frigid
order
to
be
silent
telling
herself
that
no
young
girl
could
possibly
be
natural
and
sweet
tempered
under
the
circumstances
she
was
more
than
compensated
for
what
might
have
seemed
harshness
by
something
that
looked
very
much
like
a
concession
marietta
had
not
gone
back
to
the
laboratory
since
the
discovery
of
the
new
glass
and
a
week
had
passed
since
then
nella
went
every
other
day
and
did
all
that
was
necessary
for
recovery
each
time
she
came
he
asked
her
about
marietta
in
a
rather
formal
tone
as
was
becoming
when
he
spoke
of
his
master
daughter
but
hoping
that
nella
might
have
some
message
to
deliver
and
he
was
more
and
more
disappointed
as
he
realised
that
marietta
did
not
mean
to
send
him
any
she
had
gone
away
on
that
morning
with
a
sort
of
intimation
that
she
would
come
back
every
day
but
nella
did
not
so
much
as
hint
that
she
ever
meant
to
come
back
at
all
zorzi
went
about
on
crutches
swinging
his
helpless
foot
as
he
walked
for
it
still
hurt
him
when
he
put
it
to
the
ground
he
was
pale
and
thin
both
from
pain
and
from
living
shut
up
almost
all
day
in
the
close
atmosphere
of
the
laboratory
for
a
change
he
began
to
come
out
into
the
little
garden
sometimes
walking
up
and
down
on
his
crutches
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
sitting
down
to
rest
on
the
bench
under
the
where
marietta
had
so
often
sat
pasquale
came
and
talked
with
him
sometimes
but
zorzi
never
went
to
the
porter
lodge
he
felt
that
if
he
got
as
far
as
that
he
should
inevitably
open
the
door
and
look
up
at
marietta
window
and
he
would
not
do
it
for
he
was
hurt
by
her
apparent
indifference
after
having
allowed
him
to
hold
her
hand
in
his
she
had
not
even
asked
through
nella
what
had
become
of
the
beautiful
glass
what
he
pretended
to
say
to
himself
was
that
it
would
be
very
wrong
to
go
and
stand
outside
the
where
the
porter
would
certainly
see
him
and
where
he
might
be
seen
by
any
one
else
staring
at
the
window
of
his
master
daughter
room
on
the
other
side
of
the
canal
but
what
he
really
felt
was
that
marietta
had
treated
him
capriciously
and
that
if
he
had
a
particle
of
he
must
show
her
that
he
did
not
care
for
if
marietta
was
very
like
other
carefully
brought
up
girls
of
her
age
zorzi
was
nothing
more
than
a
boy
where
love
was
concerned
and
like
many
boys
who
have
struggled
for
existence
in
a
more
or
less
corrupt
world
he
had
heard
much
more
of
the
faithlessness
and
caprices
of
women
in
general
than
of
the
sensitiveness
and
delicate
timidity
of
innocent
young
girls
marietta
was
his
perfect
ideal
the
most
exquisite
the
most
beautiful
and
the
most
lovable
creature
ever
endowed
with
form
and
sent
into
the
world
by
the
powers
of
good
he
believed
all
this
in
his
heart
with
the
certainty
of
absolute
knowledge
but
he
was
quite
incapable
of
discerning
the
motives
of
her
conduct
towards
him
and
when
he
tried
to
understand
them
it
was
not
his
heart
that
felt
but
his
reason
that
argued
having
very
little
knowledge
and
no
experience
at
all
to
help
it
and
since
his
erring
reason
demonstrated
something
that
offended
his
his
heart
was
hurt
and
nursed
a
foolish
small
resentment
against
what
he
truly
loved
better
than
life
itself
at
one
time
or
another
most
very
young
men
in
love
have
found
themselves
in
that
condition
and
have
tormented
themselves
to
the
verge
of
fever
and
distraction
over
imaginary
hurts
and
wrongs
was
there
ever
a
true
lyric
poet
who
did
not
at
least
once
in
his
early
days
believe
himself
the
victim
of
a
heartless
woman
and
though
long
afterwards
fate
may
have
brought
him
face
to
face
with
the
tragedy
of
unhappy
love
fierce
with
passion
and
terrible
with
violent
death
can
he
ever
quite
forget
the
fancied
sufferings
of
first
youth
the
stab
of
a
thoughtless
first
unkind
word
the
sickening
chill
he
felt
under
her
first
cold
look
and
what
would
first
love
be
if
young
men
and
maidens
came
to
it
with
all
the
reason
and
cool
that
long
living
brings
zorzi
sought
consolation
in
his
art
and
as
soon
as
he
could
stand
and
move
about
with
his
crutches
he
threw
his
whole
energy
into
his
work
the
accidental
discovery
of
the
red
glass
had
unexpectedly
given
him
an
empty
crucible
with
which
to
make
an
experiment
of
his
own
and
while
the
materials
were
fusing
he
attempted
to
obtain
the
new
colour
in
the
other
two
by
dropping
pieces
of
copper
into
each
regardless
of
the
master
instructions
to
his
inexpressible
disappointment
he
completely
failed
in
this
and
the
glass
he
produced
was
of
the
commonest
tint
then
he
grew
reckless
he
removed
the
two
crucibles
that
had
contained
what
had
been
made
according
to
beroviero
theories
until
he
had
added
the
copper
and
he
began
afresh
according
to
his
own
belief
on
that
very
morning
giovanni
beroviero
made
a
second
visit
to
the
laboratory
he
came
he
said
to
make
sure
that
zorzi
was
recovering
from
his
hurt
and
zorzi
knew
from
nella
that
giovanni
had
made
inquiries
about
him
he
put
on
an
air
of
sympathy
when
he
saw
the
crutches
you
will
soon
throw
them
aside
he
said
but
i
am
sorry
that
you
should
have
to
use
them
at
all
when
he
entered
zorzi
was
introducing
a
new
mixture
carefully
powdered
into
one
of
the
with
a
small
iron
shovel
it
was
clear
that
he
must
put
it
all
in
at
once
and
he
excused
himself
for
going
on
with
his
work
giovanni
looked
at
the
large
quantity
of
the
mixed
ingredients
with
an
experienced
eye
and
at
once
made
up
his
mind
that
the
crucible
must
have
been
quite
empty
zorzi
was
therefore
beginning
to
make
some
kind
of
glass
on
his
own
account
it
followed
almost
logically
according
to
giovanni
view
of
men
fairly
founded
on
a
knowledge
of
himself
that
zorzi
was
experimenting
with
the
secrets
of
paolo
godi
which
he
and
old
beroviero
had
buried
together
somewhere
in
that
very
room
now
ever
since
the
boy
had
told
his
story
giovanni
had
been
revolving
plans
for
getting
the
manuscript
into
his
possession
during
a
few
days
in
order
to
copy
it
a
new
scheme
now
suggested
itself
and
it
looked
so
attractive
that
he
at
once
attempted
to
carry
it
out
it
seems
a
pity
he
said
that
a
great
artist
like
yourself
should
spend
time
on
fruitless
experiments
you
might
be
making
very
beautiful
things
which
would
sell
for
a
high
price
without
desisting
from
his
occupation
zorzi
glanced
at
his
visitor
whose
manner
towards
him
had
so
entirely
changed
within
a
little
more
than
a
week
with
a
waif
quick
instinct
he
guessed
that
giovanni
wanted
something
of
him
but
the
generous
instinct
of
the
brave
man
towards
the
coward
made
him
accept
what
seemed
to
be
meant
for
an
advance
after
a
quarrel
it
had
never
occurred
to
zorzi
to
blame
giovanni
for
the
accident
in
the
and
it
would
have
been
very
unjust
to
do
so
i
can
blow
glass
tolerably
sir
zorzi
answered
but
none
of
you
great
furnace
owners
would
dare
to
employ
me
in
the
face
of
the
law
besides
i
am
your
father
man
i
owe
everything
i
know
to
his
kindness
i
do
not
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
it
returned
giovanni
it
does
not
diminish
your
merit
nor
affect
the
truth
of
what
i
was
saying
you
might
be
doing
better
things
any
one
can
weigh
out
sand
and
and
shovel
them
into
a
crucible
do
you
mean
that
the
master
might
employ
me
for
other
work
asked
zorzi
smiling
at
the
disdainful
description
of
what
he
was
doing
my
father
or
some
one
else
answered
giovanni
and
besides
your
astonishing
skill
i
fancy
that
you
possess
much
valuable
knowledge
of
you
can
not
have
worked
for
my
father
so
many
years
without
learning
some
of
the
things
he
has
taken
great
pains
to
hide
from
his
own
sons
he
spoke
the
last
words
in
a
somewhat
bitter
tone
quite
willing
to
let
zorzi
know
that
he
felt
himself
injured
if
i
have
learned
anything
of
that
sort
by
looking
on
and
helping
when
i
have
been
trusted
it
is
not
mine
to
use
elsewhere
said
zorzi
rather
proudly
that
is
a
fine
moral
sentiment
my
dear
young
friend
and
does
you
credit
replied
giovanni
sententiously
it
is
impossible
not
to
respect
a
man
who
carries
a
fortune
in
his
head
and
refuses
to
profit
by
it
out
of
a
delicate
sense
of
honour
i
should
have
very
little
respect
for
a
man
who
betrayed
his
secrets
said
zorzi
you
know
them
then
inquired
the
other
with
unusual
blandness
i
did
not
say
so
zorzi
looked
at
him
coldly
oh
no
even
to
admit
it
might
not
be
discreet
but
apart
from
paolo
godi
secrets
which
my
father
has
left
sealed
in
my
care
at
this
astounding
falsehood
zorzi
started
and
looked
at
giovanni
in
unfeigned
but
which
nothing
would
induce
me
to
examine
continued
giovanni
with
perfect
coolness
there
must
be
many
others
of
my
father
own
which
you
have
learned
by
watching
him
i
respect
you
for
your
discretion
why
did
you
start
and
look
at
me
when
i
said
that
the
manuscript
was
in
my
keeping
the
question
was
well
put
suddenly
and
without
warning
and
zorzi
was
momentarily
embarrassed
to
find
an
answer
giovanni
judged
that
his
surprise
proved
the
truth
of
the
boy
story
and
his
embarrassment
now
added
certainty
to
the
proof
but
zorzi
rarely
lost
his
when
he
had
a
secret
to
keep
if
i
seemed
astonished
he
said
it
may
have
been
because
you
had
just
given
me
the
impression
that
the
master
did
not
trust
you
and
i
know
how
careful
he
is
of
the
manuscript
you
know
more
than
that
my
friend
said
giovanni
in
a
playful
tone
zorzi
had
now
filled
the
crucible
and
was
replacing
the
clay
rings
which
narrow
the
aperture
of
the
he
plastered
more
wet
clay
upon
them
and
it
pleased
giovanni
to
see
how
well
he
knew
every
detail
of
the
art
from
the
simplest
to
the
most
difficult
operations
would
anything
you
can
think
of
induce
you
to
leave
my
father
giovanni
asked
as
he
had
received
no
answer
to
his
last
remark
of
course
i
do
not
mean
to
speak
of
mere
money
though
few
people
quite
despise
it
that
may
be
understood
in
more
than
one
way
answered
zorzi
cautiously
in
the
first
place
do
you
mean
that
if
i
left
the
master
it
would
be
to
go
to
another
master
or
to
set
up
as
a
master
myself
let
us
say
that
you
might
go
to
another
for
a
fixed
time
with
the
promise
of
then
having
a
furnace
of
your
own
how
does
that
strike
you
no
one
can
give
such
a
promise
and
keep
it
said
zorzi
scraping
the
wet
clay
from
his
hands
with
a
blunt
knife
but
suppose
that
some
one
could
insisted
giovanni
what
is
the
use
of
supposing
the
impossible
zorzi
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
went
on
scraping
nothing
is
impossible
in
the
republic
except
what
the
ten
are
resolved
to
hinder
and
that
is
really
impossible
the
ten
will
not
make
new
laws
nor
repeal
old
ones
for
the
benefit
of
an
unknown
dalmatian
perhaps
not
answered
giovanni
but
on
the
other
hand
there
is
no
very
great
penalty
if
you
set
up
a
furnace
of
your
own
if
you
are
discovered
your
furnace
will
be
put
out
and
you
may
have
to
pay
a
fine
it
is
no
great
matter
it
is
a
civil
offence
not
a
criminal
one
what
is
it
that
you
wish
of
me
asked
zorzi
with
sudden
directness
you
are
a
busy
man
you
have
not
come
here
to
pass
a
morning
in
idle
conversation
with
your
father
assistant
you
want
something
of
me
sir
speak
out
plainly
if
i
can
do
what
you
wish
i
will
do
it
if
i
can
not
i
will
tell
you
so
frankly
giovanni
was
a
little
disconcerted
by
this
speech
excepting
where
money
was
concerned
directly
his
intelligence
was
of
the
sort
that
easily
wastes
its
energy
in
futile
cunning
he
had
not
meant
to
reach
the
point
for
a
long
time
if
he
had
expected
to
reach
it
at
all
at
a
first
attempt
i
like
your
straightforwardness
he
said
evasively
but
i
do
not
think
your
conversation
idle
on
the
contrary
i
find
it
highly
instructive
indeed
zorzi
laughed
you
do
me
much
honour
sir
what
have
you
learned
from
me
this
morning
what
i
wished
to
know
answered
giovanni
with
a
change
of
tone
and
looking
at
him
keenly
zorzi
returned
the
glance
and
the
two
men
faced
each
other
in
silence
for
a
moment
zorzi
knew
what
giovanni
meant
as
soon
as
the
other
had
spoken
the
quick
movement
of
surprise
which
was
the
only
indiscretion
of
which
zorzi
had
been
guilty
would
have
betrayed
to
any
one
that
he
knew
where
the
manuscript
was
even
if
it
were
not
in
his
immediate
keeping
his
instinct
was
to
take
the
offensive
and
accuse
his
visitor
of
having
laid
a
trap
for
him
but
his
caution
prevailed
whatever
you
may
think
that
you
have
learned
from
me
he
said
remember
that
i
have
told
you
nothing
is
it
here
in
this
room
asked
giovanni
not
heeding
his
last
speech
and
hoping
to
surprise
him
again
but
he
was
prepared
now
and
his
face
did
not
change
as
he
replied
i
can
not
answer
any
questions
he
said
you
and
my
father
hid
it
together
returned
giovanni
when
you
had
buried
it
under
the
stones
in
this
room
you
carried
the
earth
out
with
a
shovel
and
scattered
it
about
on
a
you
took
out
three
shovelfuls
of
earth
in
that
way
you
see
i
know
everything
what
is
the
use
of
trying
to
hide
your
secret
from
me
zorzi
was
now
convinced
that
giovanni
himself
had
been
lurking
in
the
garden
sir
he
said
with
contempt
for
a
man
capable
of
such
spy
work
if
you
have
more
to
say
of
the
same
nature
pray
say
it
to
your
father
when
he
comes
back
you
misunderstand
me
returned
giovanni
with
sudden
mildness
i
had
no
intention
of
offending
you
i
only
meant
to
warn
you
that
you
were
watched
on
that
night
the
person
who
informed
me
has
no
doubt
told
many
others
also
it
would
have
been
very
ill
for
you
if
my
father
had
returned
to
find
that
his
secret
was
public
property
and
if
you
had
been
unable
to
explain
that
you
had
not
betrayed
him
i
have
given
you
a
weapon
of
defence
you
may
call
upon
me
to
repeat
what
i
have
said
when
you
speak
with
him
i
am
obliged
to
you
sir
said
zorzi
coldly
i
shall
not
need
to
disturb
you
you
are
not
wise
returned
giovanni
gravely
if
i
were
curious
fortunately
for
you
i
am
not
i
would
send
for
a
mason
and
have
some
of
the
stones
of
the
pavement
turned
over
before
me
a
mason
would
soon
find
the
one
you
moved
by
trying
them
all
with
his
hammer
yes
said
zorzi
if
this
were
a
room
in
your
own
you
could
do
that
but
it
is
not
i
am
in
charge
of
all
that
belongs
to
my
father
during
his
absence
answered
giovanni
yes
said
zorzi
again
including
paolo
godi
manuscript
as
you
told
me
he
added
you
understand
very
well
why
i
said
that
giovanni
answered
with
visible
annoyance
i
only
know
that
you
said
it
was
the
retort
and
as
i
can
not
suppose
that
you
did
not
know
what
you
were
saying
still
less
that
you
intentionally
told
an
untruth
i
really
can
not
see
why
you
should
suggest
bringing
a
mason
here
to
search
for
what
must
be
in
your
own
keeping
zorzi
spoke
with
a
quiet
smile
for
he
felt
that
he
had
the
best
of
it
be
was
surprised
when
giovanni
broke
into
a
peal
of
rather
affected
laughter
you
are
hard
to
catch
he
cried
and
laughed
again
you
did
not
really
suppose
that
i
was
in
earnest
why
every
one
knows
that
you
have
the
manuscript
here
then
i
suppose
you
spoke
ironically
suggested
zorzi
of
course
of
course
a
mere
jest
if
i
had
known
that
you
would
take
it
so
literally
he
stopped
short
pray
excuse
me
sir
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
heard
you
say
anything
playful
indeed
the
fact
is
my
dear
zorzi
i
never
knew
you
well
enough
to
jest
with
you
till
paolo
godi
secrets
in
my
keeping
i
wish
they
were
oh
not
that
anything
would
induce
me
to
break
the
seals
i
told
you
that
but
i
wish
they
were
in
my
possession
i
tell
you
i
would
pay
down
half
my
fortune
to
have
them
for
they
would
bring
me
back
four
times
as
much
within
the
year
half
my
fortune
and
i
am
not
poor
zorzi
half
your
fortune
repeated
zorzi
that
is
a
large
sum
i
imagine
pray
sir
how
much
might
half
your
fortune
be
in
round
numbers
ten
thousand
silver
lires
silver
sneered
giovanni
contemptuously
gold
then
suggested
zorzi
drawing
him
on
gold
well
possibly
admitted
giovanni
with
caution
but
of
course
i
was
exaggerating
ten
thousand
gold
pounds
would
be
too
much
of
course
say
five
thousand
i
thought
you
were
richer
than
that
said
zorzi
coolly
do
you
mean
that
five
thousand
would
not
be
enough
to
pay
for
the
manuscript
asked
giovanni
the
profits
of
are
very
large
when
one
possesses
a
valuable
secret
said
zorzi
five
thousand
he
paused
as
though
in
doubt
or
as
if
making
a
mental
calculation
giovanni
fell
into
the
trap
i
would
give
six
he
said
lowering
his
voice
to
a
still
more
confidential
tone
and
watching
his
companion
eagerly
for
six
thousand
gold
lires
said
zorzi
smiling
i
am
quite
sure
that
you
could
hire
a
ruffian
to
break
in
and
cut
the
throat
of
the
man
who
has
charge
of
the
manuscript
giovanni
face
fell
but
he
quickly
assumed
an
expression
of
righteous
indignation
how
can
you
dare
to
suggest
that
i
would
employ
such
means
to
rob
my
father
he
cried
if
it
were
your
intention
to
rob
your
father
sir
i
can
not
see
that
it
would
matter
greatly
what
means
you
employed
but
i
was
only
jesting
as
you
were
when
you
said
that
you
had
the
manuscript
i
did
not
expect
that
you
would
take
literally
what
i
said
i
see
i
see
answered
giovanni
accepting
the
means
of
escape
zorzi
offered
him
you
were
paying
me
back
in
my
own
coin
well
well
it
served
me
right
after
all
you
have
a
ready
wit
i
thought
that
if
my
conversation
were
not
as
instructive
as
you
had
hoped
i
could
at
least
try
to
make
it
amusing
light
gay
witty
i
trust
you
will
not
take
it
not
i
giovanni
tried
to
laugh
but
what
a
wonderful
thing
is
this
human
imagination
of
ours
now
as
i
talked
of
the
secrets
i
forgot
that
they
were
my
father
they
seemed
almost
within
my
grasp
i
was
ready
to
count
out
the
gold
to
count
out
six
thousand
gold
lires
think
of
that
they
are
worth
it
said
zorzi
quietly
you
should
know
best
answered
the
other
there
is
no
such
glass
as
my
father
for
lightness
and
strength
if
he
had
a
dozen
workmen
like
you
my
brother
and
i
should
be
ruined
in
trying
to
compete
with
him
i
watched
you
very
closely
the
other
day
and
i
watched
the
others
too
by
the
bye
my
friend
was
that
really
an
accident
or
does
the
man
owe
you
some
grudge
i
never
saw
such
a
thing
happen
before
it
was
an
accident
of
course
replied
zorzi
without
hesitation
if
you
knew
that
the
man
had
injured
you
intentionally
you
should
have
justice
at
once
said
giovanni
as
it
is
i
have
no
doubt
that
my
father
will
turn
him
out
without
mercy
i
hope
not
zorzi
would
say
nothing
more
giovanni
rose
to
go
away
he
stood
still
a
moment
in
thought
and
then
smiled
suddenly
as
if
recollecting
himself
the
imagination
is
an
extraordinary
thing
he
said
going
back
to
the
past
conversation
at
this
very
moment
i
was
thinking
again
that
i
was
actually
paying
out
the
money
six
thousand
lires
in
gold
i
must
be
mad
no
said
zorzi
i
think
not
giovanni
turned
away
shaking
his
head
and
still
smiling
to
tell
the
truth
though
he
knew
zorzi
character
he
had
not
believed
that
any
one
could
refuse
such
a
bribe
and
he
was
trying
to
account
for
the
dalmatian
integrity
by
reckoning
up
the
expectations
the
young
man
must
have
to
set
against
such
a
large
sum
of
ready
money
he
could
only
find
one
solution
to
the
problem
zorzi
was
already
in
full
possession
of
the
secrets
and
would
therefore
not
sell
them
at
any
price
because
he
hoped
before
long
to
set
up
for
himself
and
make
his
own
fortune
by
them
if
this
were
true
and
he
could
not
see
how
it
could
be
otherwise
he
and
his
brother
would
be
cheated
of
their
heritage
when
their
father
died
it
was
clear
that
something
must
be
done
to
hinder
zorzi
from
carrying
out
his
scheme
after
all
zorzi
own
jesting
proposal
that
a
ruffian
should
be
employed
to
cut
his
throat
was
not
to
be
rejected
it
was
a
simple
plan
direct
and
conclusive
it
might
not
be
possible
to
find
the
manuscript
after
all
but
the
only
man
who
knew
its
contents
would
be
removed
and
beroviero
sons
would
inherit
what
should
come
to
them
by
right
against
this
project
there
was
the
danger
that
the
murderer
might
some
day
betray
the
truth
under
torture
or
might
come
back
again
and
again
and
demand
more
money
but
the
killing
of
a
man
who
was
not
even
a
venetian
who
was
an
interloper
who
could
be
proved
to
have
abused
his
master
confidence
when
he
should
be
no
longer
alive
to
defend
himself
did
not
strike
giovanni
as
a
very
serious
matter
and
as
for
any
one
ever
forcing
him
to
pay
money
which
he
did
not
wish
to
pay
he
knew
that
to
be
a
feat
beyond
the
ability
of
an
ordinary
person
one
other
course
suggested
itself
at
once
he
could
forestall
zorzi
by
writing
to
his
father
and
telling
him
what
he
sincerely
believed
to
be
the
truth
he
knew
the
old
man
well
and
was
sure
that
if
once
persuaded
that
zorzi
had
betrayed
him
by
using
the
manuscript
he
would
be
merciless
the
difficulty
would
lie
in
making
beroviero
believe
anything
against
his
favourite
yet
in
giovanni
estimation
the
proofs
were
overwhelming
besides
he
had
another
weapon
with
which
to
rouse
his
father
anger
against
the
dalmatian
since
marietta
had
defied
him
and
had
gone
to
see
zorzi
in
the
laboratory
he
had
not
found
what
he
considered
a
convenient
opportunity
of
speaking
to
her
on
the
subject
that
is
to
say
he
had
lacked
the
moral
courage
to
do
so
at
all
but
it
would
need
no
courage
to
complain
of
her
conduct
to
their
father
and
though
beroviero
anger
might
fall
chiefly
upon
marietta
a
portion
of
it
would
take
effect
against
zorzi
it
would
be
one
more
force
acting
in
the
direction
of
his
ruin
giovanni
went
away
to
his
own
meditating
all
manner
of
evil
to
his
enemy
and
as
he
reckoned
up
the
chances
of
success
he
began
to
wonder
how
he
could
have
been
so
weak
as
to
offer
zorzi
an
enormous
bribe
instead
of
proceeding
at
once
to
his
destruction
unconscious
of
his
growing
danger
zorzi
fed
the
fire
of
the
furnace
and
then
sat
down
at
the
table
before
the
window
laid
his
crutches
beside
him
and
began
to
write
out
the
details
of
his
own
experiments
as
the
master
had
done
for
years
he
wrote
the
rather
elaborate
characters
of
the
fifteenth
century
in
a
small
but
clear
hand
very
unlike
old
beroviero
the
window
was
open
and
the
light
breeze
blew
in
fanning
his
heated
forehead
for
the
weather
was
growing
hotter
and
hotter
and
the
order
had
been
given
to
let
the
main
furnaces
cool
after
the
following
saturday
as
the
workmen
could
not
bear
the
heat
many
days
longer
after
that
they
would
set
to
work
in
a
shed
at
the
back
of
the
to
knead
the
clay
for
making
new
crucibles
and
the
night
boys
would
enjoy
their
annual
holiday
which
consisted
in
helping
the
workmen
by
treading
the
stiff
clay
in
water
for
several
hours
every
day
a
man
shadow
darkened
the
window
while
zorzi
was
writing
and
he
looked
up
pasquale
was
standing
outside
there
is
a
pestering
fellow
at
the
door
he
said
who
will
not
be
satisfied
till
he
has
spoken
with
you
he
says
he
has
a
message
for
you
from
some
one
in
venice
which
he
must
deliver
himself
for
me
zorzi
rose
in
surprise
chapter
xiii
zorzi
swung
himself
along
the
dark
corridor
on
his
crutches
after
pasquale
who
opened
the
outer
door
with
his
usual
deliberation
a
little
man
stood
outside
in
grey
hose
and
a
servant
dark
coat
gathered
in
at
the
waist
by
a
leathern
belt
he
was
clean
shaven
and
his
hair
was
cropped
close
to
his
head
which
was
bare
for
he
held
his
black
hat
in
his
hand
zorzi
did
not
like
his
face
he
waited
for
zorzi
to
speak
first
have
you
a
message
for
me
asked
the
dalmatian
i
am
zorzi
that
is
the
name
sir
answered
the
man
respectfully
my
master
begs
the
honour
and
pleasure
of
your
company
this
evening
as
usual
where
asked
zorzi
my
master
said
that
you
would
know
the
place
sir
having
been
there
before
what
is
your
master
name
the
angel
answered
the
man
promptly
keeping
his
eyes
on
face
the
latter
nodded
and
the
servant
at
once
made
an
awkward
obeisance
preparatory
to
going
away
tell
your
master
said
zorzi
that
i
have
hurt
my
foot
and
am
walking
on
crutches
so
that
i
can
not
come
this
evening
but
that
i
thank
him
for
his
invitation
and
send
greeting
to
him
and
to
the
other
guests
the
man
repeated
some
of
the
words
in
a
tone
hardly
audible
evidently
committing
the
message
to
memory
signor
zorzi
hurt
his
foot
crutches
thanks
greeting
he
mumbled
yes
sir
he
added
in
his
ordinary
voice
i
will
say
all
that
your
servant
sir
with
another
awkward
bow
he
turned
away
to
the
right
and
walked
very
quickly
along
the
footway
he
had
left
his
boat
at
the
entrance
to
the
canal
not
knowing
exactly
where
the
was
zorzi
looked
after
him
a
moment
then
turned
himself
on
his
sound
foot
and
set
his
crutches
before
him
to
go
in
pasquale
was
there
and
must
have
heard
what
had
passed
he
shut
the
door
and
followed
zorzi
back
a
little
way
it
is
no
concern
of
mine
he
said
roughly
you
may
amuse
yourself
as
you
please
for
you
are
young
and
your
host
may
be
the
archangel
michael
himself
or
the
holy
saint
mark
and
the
house
to
which
you
are
bidden
may
be
a
paradise
full
of
other
angels
but
i
would
as
soon
sit
down
before
the
grating
and
look
at
the
hooded
brother
while
the
executioner
slipped
the
noose
over
my
head
to
strangle
me
as
to
go
to
any
place
on
a
bidding
delivered
by
a
fellow
with
such
a
head
it
is
as
round
as
a
bullet
and
as
yellow
as
cheese
he
has
eyes
like
a
turtle
and
teeth
like
those
of
a
young
shark
i
am
quite
of
your
opinion
said
zorzi
halting
at
the
entrance
to
the
garden
then
why
did
you
not
kick
him
into
the
canal
inquired
the
porter
with
admirable
logic
do
i
look
as
if
i
could
kick
anything
asked
zorzi
laughing
and
glancing
at
his
lame
foot
and
where
should
i
have
been
inquired
pasquale
indignantly
asleep
perhaps
if
you
had
said
i
would
have
kicked
perhaps
i
am
a
statue
zorzi
pointed
out
that
it
was
not
usual
to
answer
invitations
in
that
way
even
when
declining
them
and
who
knows
what
sort
of
invitation
it
was
retorted
the
old
porter
discontentedly
since
when
have
you
friends
in
venice
who
bid
you
come
to
their
houses
at
night
like
a
thief
honest
men
who
are
friends
say
and
eat
with
me
at
noon
for
we
have
this
or
this
say
a
roast
sucking
pig
or
tripe
with
garlic
and
perhaps
you
go
and
when
you
have
eaten
and
drunk
and
it
is
the
cool
of
the
afternoon
you
come
home
that
is
what
christians
do
who
are
they
that
meet
at
night
they
are
thieves
or
conspirators
or
or
all
three
pasquale
happened
to
have
been
right
in
two
guesses
out
of
three
and
zorzi
thought
it
better
to
say
nothing
there
was
no
fear
that
the
surly
old
man
would
tell
any
one
of
the
message
he
had
proved
himself
too
good
a
friend
to
zorzi
to
do
anything
which
could
possibly
bring
him
into
trouble
and
zorzi
was
willing
to
let
him
think
what
he
pleased
rather
than
run
the
smallest
risk
of
betraying
the
society
of
which
he
had
been
obliged
to
become
a
member
but
he
was
curious
to
know
why
contarini
kept
such
a
singularly
unprepossessing
servant
and
why
if
he
chose
to
keep
him
he
made
use
of
him
to
deliver
invitations
the
fellow
had
the
look
of
a
born
criminal
he
was
just
such
a
man
as
zorzi
had
thought
of
when
he
had
jestingly
proposed
to
giovanni
to
hire
a
murderer
indeed
the
more
zorzi
thought
of
his
face
the
more
he
was
inclined
to
doubt
that
the
man
came
from
contarini
at
all
but
in
this
he
was
mistaken
the
message
was
genuine
and
moreover
so
far
as
contarini
and
the
society
were
concerned
the
man
was
perfectly
trustworthy
possibly
there
were
reasons
why
contarini
chose
to
employ
him
and
also
why
the
servant
was
so
consistently
faithful
to
his
master
after
all
zorzi
reflected
he
was
certainly
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
the
noble
young
idlers
who
met
at
the
house
of
the
agnus
dei
were
playing
at
conspiracy
and
revolution
but
that
night
when
contarini
friends
were
assembled
and
had
counted
their
members
some
one
asked
what
had
become
of
the
murano
and
whether
he
was
not
going
to
attend
their
meetings
in
future
and
contarini
answered
that
zorzi
had
hurt
his
foot
and
was
on
crutches
and
sent
a
greeting
to
the
guests
most
of
them
were
glad
that
he
was
not
there
for
he
was
not
of
their
own
order
and
his
presence
caused
a
certain
restraint
in
their
talk
besides
he
was
poor
and
did
not
play
at
dice
he
works
with
angelo
beroviero
does
he
not
asked
zuan
venier
in
a
tone
of
weary
indifference
yes
answered
contarini
with
a
laugh
he
is
in
the
service
of
my
future
to
whom
may
heaven
accord
a
speedy
painless
and
christian
death
laughed
foscari
in
his
black
beard
not
till
i
am
one
of
his
heirs
if
you
please
returned
contarini
as
soon
after
the
wedding
day
as
you
like
for
besides
her
rich
dowry
the
lady
is
to
have
a
share
of
his
inheritance
is
she
very
ugly
asked
loredan
poor
jacopo
you
have
the
sympathy
of
the
brethren
how
does
he
know
sneered
mocenigo
he
has
never
seen
her
besides
why
should
he
care
since
she
is
rich
you
are
mistaken
for
i
have
seen
her
said
contarini
looking
down
the
table
she
is
not
at
all
i
assure
you
the
old
man
was
so
much
afraid
that
i
would
not
agree
to
the
match
that
he
took
her
to
church
so
that
i
might
look
at
her
and
you
did
asked
mocenigo
i
should
never
have
had
the
courage
she
might
have
been
hideous
and
in
that
case
i
should
have
preferred
not
to
find
it
out
till
i
was
married
i
looked
at
her
with
some
interest
said
contarini
smiling
in
a
way
i
am
bound
to
say
with
all
modesty
that
she
also
looked
at
me
he
added
passing
his
white
hand
over
his
thick
hair
of
course
put
in
foscari
gravely
any
woman
would
i
should
think
i
suppose
so
answered
contarini
complacently
it
is
not
my
fault
if
they
do
nor
your
misfortune
added
fosoari
with
as
much
gravity
as
before
zuan
venier
had
not
joined
in
the
banter
which
seemed
to
him
to
be
of
the
most
atrocious
taste
he
had
liked
zorzi
and
had
just
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
murano
the
next
day
and
find
him
out
on
that
evening
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
mention
of
what
was
supposed
to
bring
them
together
before
they
had
talked
a
quarter
of
an
hour
some
one
began
to
throw
dice
on
the
table
playing
with
his
right
hand
against
his
left
and
in
a
few
moments
the
real
play
had
begun
high
up
in
arisa
room
the
georgian
woman
and
aristarchi
heard
all
that
was
said
crouching
together
upon
the
floor
beside
the
opening
the
slave
had
discovered
when
the
voices
were
no
longer
heard
except
at
rare
intervals
in
short
exclamations
of
satisfaction
or
disappointment
and
only
the
regular
rattling
and
falling
of
the
dice
broke
the
silence
the
pair
drew
back
from
the
they
will
say
nothing
more
whispered
arisa
they
will
play
for
hours
they
had
not
said
a
word
that
could
put
their
necks
in
danger
answered
aristarchi
discontentedly
who
is
this
fellow
from
the
of
whom
they
were
speaking
arisa
led
him
away
to
a
small
divan
between
the
open
windows
she
sat
down
against
the
cushions
at
the
back
but
he
stretched
his
bulk
upon
the
floor
resting
his
head
against
her
knee
she
softly
rubbed
his
rough
hair
with
the
palm
of
her
hand
as
she
might
have
caressed
a
cat
or
a
tame
wild
animal
it
gave
her
a
pleasant
sensation
that
had
a
thrill
of
danger
in
it
for
she
always
expected
that
he
would
turn
and
set
his
teeth
into
her
fingers
she
told
him
the
story
of
the
last
meeting
and
how
zorzi
had
been
made
one
of
the
society
in
order
that
they
might
not
feel
obliged
to
kill
him
for
their
own
safety
what
fools
they
are
exclaimed
aristarchi
with
a
low
laugh
and
turning
his
head
under
her
hand
you
would
have
killed
him
of
course
said
arisa
if
you
had
been
in
their
place
i
suppose
you
have
killed
many
people
she
added
thoughtfully
no
he
answered
for
though
he
loved
her
savagely
he
did
not
trust
her
i
never
killed
any
one
except
in
fair
fight
arisa
laughed
low
for
she
remembered
when
i
first
saw
you
she
said
your
hands
were
covered
with
blood
i
think
the
reason
why
i
liked
you
was
that
you
seemed
so
much
more
terrible
than
all
the
others
who
looked
in
at
my
cabin
door
i
am
as
mild
as
milk
and
almonds
said
aristarchi
i
am
as
timid
as
a
rabbit
his
deep
voice
was
like
the
purring
of
a
huge
cat
arisa
looked
down
at
his
head
then
her
hands
suddenly
clasped
his
throat
and
she
tried
to
make
her
fingers
meet
round
it
as
if
she
would
have
strangled
him
but
it
was
too
big
for
them
he
drew
in
his
chin
a
little
the
iron
muscles
stiffened
themselves
the
cords
stood
out
and
though
she
pressed
with
all
her
might
she
could
not
hurt
him
even
a
little
but
she
loved
to
try
i
am
sure
i
could
strangle
contarini
she
said
quietly
he
has
a
throat
like
a
woman
what
a
murderous
creature
you
are
purred
the
greek
against
hex
knee
you
are
always
talking
of
killing
i
should
like
to
see
you
fighting
for
your
life
she
answered
or
for
me
it
is
the
same
thing
he
said
i
should
like
to
see
it
it
would
be
a
splendid
sight
what
if
i
got
the
worst
of
it
asked
aristarchi
his
vast
mouth
grinning
at
the
idea
you
arisa
laughed
contemptuously
the
man
is
not
born
who
could
kill
you
i
am
sure
of
it
one
very
nearly
succeeded
once
upon
a
time
said
aristarchi
one
man
i
do
not
believe
it
he
chanced
to
be
an
executioner
answered
the
greek
calmly
and
i
had
my
hands
tied
behind
me
tell
me
about
it
arisa
bent
down
eagerly
for
she
loved
to
hear
of
his
adventures
though
he
had
his
own
way
of
narrating
them
which
always
made
him
out
innocent
of
any
evil
intention
there
is
nothing
to
tell
it
was
in
naples
a
woman
betrayed
me
and
they
bound
me
in
my
sleep
in
the
morning
i
was
condemned
to
death
thrown
into
a
cart
and
dragged
off
to
be
hanged
i
thought
it
was
all
over
for
the
cords
were
new
so
that
i
could
not
break
them
i
tried
hard
enough
but
even
if
i
had
broken
loose
i
could
never
have
fought
my
way
through
the
crowd
alone
the
noose
was
around
my
neck
he
stopped
as
if
he
had
told
everything
go
on
said
arisa
how
did
you
escape
what
an
adventure
one
of
my
men
saved
me
he
had
a
little
learning
and
could
pass
for
a
monk
when
he
could
get
a
cowl
he
went
out
before
it
was
daylight
that
morning
and
exchanged
clothes
with
a
burly
friar
whom
he
met
in
a
quiet
place
but
how
did
the
friar
agree
to
that
asked
arisa
in
surprise
he
had
nothing
to
say
he
was
dead
answered
aristarchi
do
you
mean
to
say
that
he
chanced
to
find
a
dead
friar
lying
in
the
road
asked
the
georgian
how
should
i
know
i
daresay
the
monk
was
alive
when
he
met
my
man
and
happened
to
die
a
few
minutes
afterwards
by
mere
chance
it
was
very
fortunate
was
it
not
yes
arisa
laughed
softly
but
what
did
he
do
why
did
he
take
the
trouble
to
dress
the
monk
in
his
clothes
in
order
to
receive
his
dying
confession
of
course
i
thought
you
would
understand
and
his
dying
confession
was
that
he
michael
pandos
a
greek
robber
had
killed
the
man
for
whose
murder
i
was
being
hanged
that
morning
my
man
came
just
in
time
for
as
the
friar
head
was
half
shaved
as
monks
heads
are
he
had
to
shave
the
rest
as
they
do
for
coolness
in
the
south
and
he
had
only
his
knife
with
which
to
do
it
but
no
one
found
that
out
for
he
had
been
a
barber
as
he
had
been
a
monk
and
most
other
things
he
looked
very
well
in
a
cowl
and
spoke
neapolitan
i
did
not
know
him
when
he
came
to
the
foot
of
the
gallows
howling
out
that
i
was
innocent
were
you
asked
arisa
of
course
i
was
answered
aristarchi
with
conviction
who
was
the
man
that
had
been
killed
i
forget
his
name
said
the
greek
he
was
a
neapolitan
gentleman
of
great
family
i
believe
i
forget
the
name
he
had
red
hair
arisa
laughed
and
stroked
aristarchi
big
head
she
thought
she
had
made
him
betray
himself
you
had
seen
him
then
she
said
with
a
question
i
suppose
you
happened
to
see
him
just
before
he
died
as
your
man
saw
the
monk
oh
no
answered
aristarchi
who
was
not
to
be
so
easily
caught
it
was
part
of
the
dying
confession
it
was
necessary
to
identify
the
murdered
person
how
should
michael
parados
the
greek
robber
know
the
name
of
the
gentleman
he
had
killed
he
gave
a
minute
description
of
him
he
said
he
had
red
hair
you
are
not
a
greek
for
nothing
laughed
arisa
did
you
ever
hear
of
odysseus
asked
aristarchi
no
what
should
i
know
of
your
greek
gods
if
you
were
a
good
christian
you
would
not
speak
of
them
odysseus
was
not
a
god
answered
aristarchi
with
a
grin
he
was
a
good
christian
i
have
often
thought
that
he
must
have
been
very
like
me
he
was
a
great
traveller
and
a
tolerable
sailor
a
pirate
inquired
arisa
oh
no
he
was
a
man
of
the
most
noble
and
upright
character
incapable
of
deception
in
fact
he
was
very
like
me
and
had
nearly
as
many
adventures
if
you
understood
greek
i
would
repeat
some
verses
i
know
about
him
should
you
love
me
more
if
i
understood
greek
asked
arisa
softly
if
i
thought
so
i
would
learn
it
aristarchi
laughed
roughly
so
that
she
was
almost
afraid
lest
he
should
be
heard
far
down
in
the
house
learn
greek
you
to
make
me
like
you
better
you
would
be
just
as
beautiful
if
you
were
altogether
dumb
a
man
does
not
love
a
woman
for
what
she
can
say
to
him
in
any
language
he
turned
up
his
face
and
his
rough
hands
drew
her
splendid
head
down
to
him
till
he
could
kiss
her
then
there
was
silence
for
a
few
minutes
he
shook
his
great
shoulders
at
last
everything
else
is
a
waste
of
time
he
said
as
if
speaking
to
himself
her
head
lay
on
the
cushions
now
and
she
watched
him
with
eyes
in
the
soft
light
and
now
and
then
the
thin
embroideries
that
covered
her
neck
and
bosom
rose
and
fell
with
a
long
satisfied
sigh
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
slowly
paced
the
marble
floor
up
and
down
before
her
as
he
would
have
paced
the
little
of
his
vessel
i
am
glad
you
told
me
about
that
he
said
suddenly
i
have
met
him
and
talked
with
him
and
i
may
meet
him
again
he
is
old
beroviero
chief
assistant
i
fancy
he
is
in
love
with
the
daughter
in
love
with
the
girl
whom
contarini
is
to
marry
asked
arisa
suddenly
opening
her
eyes
yes
i
told
you
what
i
said
to
the
old
man
in
his
private
room
it
was
more
like
a
than
a
rich
man
while
i
was
inside
the
young
man
was
talking
to
the
girl
under
a
tree
i
saw
them
through
a
low
window
as
i
sat
discussing
business
with
beroviero
you
could
not
hear
what
they
said
i
suppose
no
but
i
could
see
what
they
looked
aristarchi
laughed
at
his
own
conceit
the
girl
was
doing
some
kind
of
work
the
young
man
stood
beside
her
resting
one
hand
against
the
tree
i
could
not
see
his
face
all
the
time
but
i
saw
hers
she
is
in
love
with
him
they
were
talking
earnestly
and
she
said
something
that
had
a
strong
effect
upon
him
for
i
saw
that
he
stood
a
long
time
looking
at
the
trunk
of
the
tree
and
saying
nothing
what
can
you
make
of
that
except
that
they
are
in
love
with
each
other
that
is
strange
said
arisa
for
it
was
he
that
brought
the
message
to
contarini
bidding
him
go
and
see
her
in
saint
mark
that
was
how
he
chanced
upon
them
downstairs
at
their
last
meeting
how
do
you
know
it
was
that
message
and
not
some
other
contarini
told
me
but
if
the
boy
loves
her
as
i
am
sure
he
does
why
should
he
have
delivered
the
message
asked
the
cunning
greek
it
would
have
been
very
easy
for
him
to
have
named
another
hour
and
contarini
would
never
have
seen
her
besides
he
had
a
fine
chance
then
to
send
the
future
husband
to
paradise
he
needed
only
to
name
a
quiet
street
instead
of
the
church
and
to
appoint
the
hour
at
dusk
one
two
and
three
in
the
back
the
body
to
the
canal
and
the
marriage
would
have
been
broken
off
perhaps
he
does
not
wish
it
broken
off
suggested
arisa
taking
an
equally
amiable
but
somewhat
different
point
of
view
he
can
not
marry
the
girl
of
course
but
if
she
is
once
married
and
out
of
her
house
it
will
be
different
that
is
an
idea
assented
aristarchi
look
at
us
two
it
is
very
much
the
same
position
and
contarini
will
be
indifferent
about
her
which
he
is
not
where
you
are
concerned
between
the
and
me
and
his
wife
and
you
he
will
not
be
a
man
to
be
envied
that
is
another
reason
for
helping
the
marriage
as
much
as
we
can
what
if
the
makes
her
give
him
money
asked
the
georgian
woman
if
she
loves
him
she
will
give
him
everything
she
has
and
he
will
take
all
he
can
get
of
course
of
course
if
she
had
anything
to
give
said
aristarchi
but
she
will
only
have
what
you
allow
contarini
to
give
her
the
young
man
knows
well
enough
that
her
dowry
will
all
be
paid
to
her
husband
on
the
day
of
the
marriage
it
does
not
matter
for
if
he
is
in
love
he
will
not
care
much
about
the
money
i
hope
he
will
be
careful
any
one
else
may
see
him
with
her
as
you
did
and
may
warn
old
contarini
that
his
intended
is
in
love
with
a
boy
belonging
to
the
the
marriage
would
be
broken
off
at
once
if
that
happened
that
is
true
so
they
talked
together
judging
zorzi
and
marietta
according
to
their
views
of
human
nature
which
they
deduced
chiefly
from
their
experience
of
themselves
from
time
to
time
arisa
went
and
listened
at
the
hole
in
the
floor
and
when
she
heard
the
guests
beginning
to
take
their
leave
she
hid
aristarchi
in
the
embrasure
of
a
disused
window
that
was
concealed
by
a
tapestry
and
she
went
into
the
larger
room
and
lay
down
among
the
cushions
by
the
balcony
when
contarini
came
a
few
minutes
later
she
seemed
to
have
fallen
asleep
like
a
child
weary
of
waiting
for
him
so
far
both
she
and
aristarchi
looked
upon
zorzi
who
did
not
know
of
their
existence
with
a
friendly
eye
but
their
knowledge
of
his
love
for
marietta
was
in
reality
one
more
danger
in
his
path
if
at
any
future
moment
he
seemed
about
to
endanger
the
success
of
their
plans
the
strong
greek
would
soon
find
an
opportunity
of
sending
him
to
another
world
as
he
had
sent
many
another
innocent
enemy
before
they
themselves
were
safe
enough
for
the
present
and
it
was
not
likely
that
they
would
commit
any
indiscretion
that
might
endanger
their
future
flight
they
had
long
ago
determined
what
to
do
if
contarini
should
accidentally
find
aristarchi
in
the
house
long
before
his
body
was
found
they
would
both
be
on
the
high
seas
few
persons
knew
of
existence
no
one
connected
the
greek
merchant
captain
in
any
way
with
contarini
and
no
one
guessed
the
sailing
qualities
of
the
unobtrusive
vessel
that
lay
in
the
giudecca
waiting
for
a
cargo
but
ballasted
to
do
her
best
and
well
stocked
with
provisions
and
water
the
crew
knew
nothing
when
other
sailors
asked
when
they
were
to
sail
the
men
could
only
say
that
their
captain
was
the
owner
of
the
vessel
and
was
very
hard
to
please
in
the
matter
of
a
cargo
in
one
way
or
another
the
two
were
sure
of
gaining
their
end
as
soon
as
they
should
have
amassed
a
sufficient
fortune
to
live
in
luxury
somewhere
in
the
far
south
a
change
in
the
situation
was
brought
about
by
the
appearance
of
zuan
venier
at
the
on
the
following
morning
indolent
tired
of
his
existence
sick
of
what
amused
and
interested
his
companions
but
generous
true
and
he
had
been
sorry
to
hear
that
zorzi
had
suffered
by
an
accident
and
he
felt
impelled
to
go
and
see
whether
the
young
fellow
needed
help
venier
did
not
remember
that
he
had
ever
resisted
an
impulse
in
his
life
though
he
took
the
greatest
pains
to
hide
the
fact
that
he
ever
felt
any
he
perhaps
did
not
realise
that
although
he
had
done
many
foolish
things
and
some
that
a
confessor
would
not
have
approved
he
had
never
wished
to
do
anything
that
was
mean
or
unkind
or
that
might
give
him
an
unfair
advantage
over
others
he
fancied
zorzi
alone
uncared
for
perhaps
obliged
to
work
in
spite
of
his
lameness
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
help
him
in
some
way
though
it
was
by
no
means
clear
what
direction
his
help
should
take
he
did
not
know
that
beroviero
was
absent
and
he
intended
to
call
for
the
old
it
would
be
easy
to
say
that
he
was
an
old
friend
of
jacopo
contarini
and
wished
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
father
before
the
wedding
he
would
probably
have
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
zorzi
without
showing
that
he
already
knew
him
and
he
trusted
to
zorzi
discretion
to
conceal
the
fact
for
he
was
a
good
judge
of
men
it
turned
out
to
be
much
easier
to
carry
out
his
plan
than
he
had
expected
my
name
is
zuan
venier
he
said
in
answer
to
pasquale
gruff
inquiry
pasquale
eyed
him
a
moment
through
the
bars
and
immediately
understood
that
he
was
not
a
person
to
be
kicked
into
the
canal
or
received
with
other
similar
amenities
the
great
name
alone
would
have
awed
the
old
porter
to
something
like
civility
but
he
had
seen
the
visitor
face
and
being
quite
as
good
a
judge
of
humanity
as
venier
himself
he
opened
the
door
at
once
venier
explained
that
he
wished
to
pay
his
respects
to
messer
angelo
beroviero
being
an
old
friend
of
messer
jacopo
contarini
learning
that
the
master
was
absent
on
a
journey
he
asked
whether
there
were
any
one
within
to
whom
he
could
deliver
a
message
he
had
heard
he
said
that
the
master
had
a
trusted
assistant
a
certain
zorzi
pasquale
answered
that
zorzi
was
in
the
laboratory
and
led
the
way
zorzi
was
greatly
surprised
but
as
venier
had
anticipated
he
said
nothing
before
pasquale
which
could
show
that
he
had
met
his
visitor
before
venier
made
a
courteous
inclination
of
the
head
and
the
porter
disappeared
immediately
i
heard
that
you
had
been
hurt
said
venier
when
they
were
alone
i
came
to
see
whether
i
could
do
anything
for
you
can
i
zorzi
was
touched
by
the
kind
words
spoken
so
quietly
and
sincerely
for
it
was
only
lately
that
any
one
except
marietta
had
shown
him
a
little
consideration
he
had
not
forgotten
how
his
master
had
taken
leave
of
him
and
the
unexpected
friendliness
of
old
pasquale
after
his
accident
had
made
a
difference
in
his
life
but
of
all
men
he
had
ever
met
venier
was
the
one
whom
he
had
instinctively
desired
for
a
friend
have
you
come
over
from
venice
on
purpose
to
see
me
he
asked
in
something
like
wonder
yes
answered
venier
with
a
smile
why
are
you
surprised
because
it
is
so
good
of
you
you
have
solemnly
sworn
to
do
as
much
for
me
and
for
all
the
companions
of
our
society
returned
venier
still
smiling
we
are
to
help
each
other
under
all
circumstances
as
far
as
we
can
you
know
you
are
standing
and
it
must
tire
you
with
those
crutches
shall
we
sit
down
tell
me
quite
frankly
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
nothing
you
could
ever
do
could
make
me
more
grateful
than
i
am
to
you
for
coming
answered
zorzi
sincerely
venier
took
the
crutches
from
his
hands
and
helped
him
to
sit
on
the
bench
you
are
very
kind
zorzi
said
venier
sat
down
beside
him
and
asked
him
all
manner
of
questions
about
his
accident
and
how
it
had
happened
zorzi
had
no
reason
for
concealing
the
truth
from
him
they
all
hate
me
here
he
said
it
happened
like
an
accident
but
the
man
made
it
happen
i
do
not
think
that
he
intended
to
maim
me
for
life
but
he
meant
to
hurt
me
badly
and
he
did
there
was
not
a
man
or
a
boy
in
the
furnace
room
who
did
not
understand
for
no
workman
ever
yet
let
his
slip
from
his
hand
in
swinging
a
piece
but
i
do
not
wish
to
make
matters
worse
and
i
have
said
that
i
believed
it
was
an
accident
i
should
like
to
come
across
the
man
who
did
it
said
venier
his
eyes
growing
hard
and
steely
when
i
tried
to
hop
to
the
furnace
on
one
leg
to
save
myself
from
falling
one
of
the
men
cried
out
that
i
was
a
dancer
and
laughed
i
hear
that
the
name
has
stuck
to
me
among
the
workmen
i
am
called
the
the
ignoble
meanness
of
zorzi
tormentors
roused
venier
generous
blood
you
will
yet
be
their
master
he
said
you
will
some
day
have
a
furnace
of
your
own
and
they
will
fawn
to
you
your
nickname
will
be
better
than
their
names
in
a
few
years
i
hope
so
answered
zorzi
i
know
it
said
the
other
with
an
energy
that
would
have
surprised
those
who
only
knew
the
listless
young
nobleman
whom
nothing
could
amuse
or
interest
he
did
not
stay
very
long
and
when
he
went
away
he
said
nothing
about
coming
again
zorzi
went
with
him
to
the
door
he
had
asked
the
dalmatian
to
tell
old
beroviero
of
his
visit
pasquale
who
had
never
done
such
a
thing
in
his
life
actually
went
out
upon
the
footway
to
the
steps
and
steadied
the
gondola
by
the
gunwale
while
venier
got
in
giovanni
beroviero
saw
venier
come
out
for
it
was
near
noon
and
he
had
just
come
back
from
his
own
and
was
standing
in
the
shadow
of
his
father
doorway
slowly
fanning
himself
with
his
large
cap
before
he
went
upstairs
for
it
had
been
very
hot
in
the
sun
he
did
not
know
zuan
venier
by
sight
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
high
station
and
he
was
surprised
to
see
that
the
nobleman
was
evidently
on
good
terns
with
zorzi
chapter
xiv
zorzi
had
not
left
the
since
he
had
been
hurt
but
he
foresaw
that
he
might
be
obliged
to
leave
the
laboratory
for
an
hour
or
more
now
that
he
was
better
he
could
walk
with
one
crutch
and
a
stick
resting
a
little
on
the
injured
foot
and
he
felt
sure
that
in
a
few
days
he
should
be
able
to
walk
with
the
stick
alone
he
had
the
certainty
that
he
was
lame
for
life
and
now
and
then
when
it
was
dusk
and
he
sat
under
the
meditating
upon
the
uncertain
future
he
felt
a
keen
pang
at
the
thought
that
he
might
never
again
walk
without
limping
for
he
had
been
light
and
agile
and
very
swift
of
foot
as
a
boy
he
fancied
that
marietta
would
pity
him
but
not
as
she
had
pitied
him
at
first
there
would
be
a
little
feeling
of
repulsion
for
the
cripple
mixed
with
her
compassion
for
the
man
it
was
true
that
as
matters
were
going
now
he
might
not
see
her
often
again
and
he
was
quite
sure
that
he
had
no
right
to
think
of
loving
her
zuan
venier
visit
had
recalled
very
clearly
the
obligations
by
which
he
had
solemnly
bound
himself
and
which
he
honestly
meant
to
fulfil
and
apart
from
them
when
he
tried
to
reason
about
his
love
he
could
make
it
seem
absurd
enough
that
he
should
dream
of
winning
marietta
for
his
wife
but
love
itself
does
not
argue
at
first
it
is
seen
far
off
like
a
beautiful
bird
of
rare
plumage
among
flowers
on
a
morning
in
spring
it
comes
nearer
it
is
timid
it
advances
it
recedes
it
poises
on
swiftly
beating
wings
it
soars
out
of
sight
but
suddenly
it
is
nearer
than
before
it
changes
shapes
and
grows
vast
and
terrible
till
its
flight
is
like
the
rushing
of
the
whirlwind
then
all
is
calm
again
and
in
the
stillness
a
sweet
voice
sings
the
chant
of
peace
or
the
melancholy
dirge
of
an
endless
regret
it
is
no
longer
the
dove
nor
the
eagle
nor
the
storm
that
leaves
ruin
in
its
track
it
is
everything
it
is
life
it
is
the
world
itself
for
ever
and
time
without
end
for
good
or
evil
for
such
happiness
as
may
pass
all
understanding
if
god
will
and
if
not
for
undying
sorrow
zorzi
had
forgotten
his
small
resentment
against
marietta
for
not
having
given
him
a
sign
nor
sent
one
word
of
greeting
he
knew
only
that
he
loved
her
with
all
his
heart
and
would
give
every
hope
he
had
for
the
pressure
of
her
hand
in
his
and
the
sound
of
her
answering
voice
and
he
dreaded
lest
she
should
pity
him
as
one
pities
a
hurt
creature
that
one
would
rather
not
touch
it
would
not
be
in
the
hope
of
seeing
her
that
he
might
leave
the
laboratory
before
long
he
felt
quite
sure
that
giovanni
would
make
some
further
attempt
to
get
possession
of
the
little
book
that
meant
fortune
to
him
who
should
possess
it
and
giovanni
evidently
knew
where
it
was
it
would
he
easy
for
him
to
send
zorzi
on
an
errand
of
importance
as
soon
as
he
should
be
so
far
recovered
as
to
walk
a
little
the
great
had
dealings
with
the
banks
in
venice
and
with
merchants
of
all
countries
and
beroviero
had
more
than
once
sent
zorzi
to
venice
on
business
of
moment
giovanni
would
come
in
some
morning
and
declare
that
he
could
trust
no
one
but
zorzi
to
collect
certain
sums
of
money
in
the
city
and
he
would
take
care
that
the
matter
should
keep
him
absent
several
hours
that
would
be
ample
time
in
which
to
try
the
flagstones
with
a
hammer
and
to
turn
over
the
right
one
zorzi
had
convinced
himself
that
it
gave
a
hollow
sound
when
he
tapped
it
and
that
giovanni
could
find
it
easily
enough
it
was
therefore
folly
to
leave
the
box
in
its
present
place
any
longer
and
he
cast
about
in
his
mind
for
some
safer
spot
in
which
to
hide
it
in
the
meantime
fearing
lest
giovanni
might
think
of
sending
him
out
at
any
moment
he
waited
till
pasquale
had
brought
him
water
in
the
morning
and
then
raised
the
stone
as
he
had
done
before
took
the
box
out
of
the
earth
and
hid
it
in
the
cool
end
of
the
annealing
oven
while
he
replaced
the
slab
the
effort
it
cost
him
to
move
the
latter
told
him
plainly
enough
that
his
injury
had
weakened
him
almost
as
an
illness
might
have
done
but
he
succeeded
in
getting
the
stone
into
its
bed
at
last
he
tapped
it
with
the
end
of
his
crutch
as
he
knelt
on
the
floor
and
the
sound
it
gave
was
even
more
hollow
than
before
he
smiled
as
he
thought
how
easily
giovanni
would
find
the
place
and
how
grievously
disappointed
he
would
be
when
he
realised
that
it
was
empty
it
occurred
at
once
to
zorzi
that
giovanni
first
impression
would
naturally
be
that
zorzi
had
taken
the
book
himself
in
order
to
use
it
during
the
master
absence
and
this
thought
perplexed
him
for
a
time
until
he
reflected
that
giovanni
could
not
accuse
him
of
the
deed
without
accusing
himself
of
having
searched
for
the
box
a
proceeding
which
his
father
would
never
forgive
zorzi
did
not
intend
to
tell
the
master
of
his
conversation
with
giovanni
nor
of
his
suspicions
he
would
only
say
that
the
had
not
seemed
safe
enough
because
the
stone
gave
a
hollow
sound
which
even
the
boys
would
notice
if
anything
fell
upon
it
but
for
nella
it
would
be
safest
to
give
the
box
into
keeping
since
no
one
could
possibly
suspect
that
it
could
have
found
its
way
to
her
room
at
the
mere
thought
his
heart
beat
fast
it
would
be
a
reason
for
seeing
her
alone
if
he
could
and
for
talking
with
her
he
planned
how
he
would
send
her
a
message
by
nella
begging
that
he
might
speak
to
her
on
some
urgent
business
of
her
father
and
she
would
come
as
she
had
come
before
they
would
talk
in
the
garden
under
the
where
pasquale
and
nella
could
see
them
and
he
would
explain
what
he
wanted
then
he
would
give
her
the
box
he
thought
of
it
with
calm
delight
as
he
saw
it
all
in
a
beautiful
vision
but
there
was
nella
and
there
was
pasquale
the
former
indiscreet
the
latter
silent
but
and
in
spite
of
his
slow
and
surly
ways
every
one
knew
that
the
book
existed
somewhere
and
the
porter
and
the
would
guess
the
truth
at
once
at
present
no
one
but
himself
knew
positively
where
the
thing
was
if
he
carried
out
his
plan
three
other
persons
would
possess
the
knowledge
it
was
not
to
be
thought
of
he
looked
about
the
laboratory
there
were
the
beams
and
crossbeams
and
the
box
would
probably
just
fit
into
one
of
the
shadowy
interstices
between
two
of
the
latter
but
they
were
twenty
feet
from
the
ground
he
had
no
ladder
and
if
there
had
been
one
at
hand
he
could
not
have
mounted
it
yet
his
eye
fell
on
the
big
earthen
jar
more
than
half
a
man
height
and
as
big
round
as
a
hogshead
half
full
of
broken
glass
from
the
experiments
no
one
would
think
of
it
as
a
place
for
hiding
anything
and
it
would
not
be
emptied
till
it
was
quite
full
several
months
hence
besides
no
one
would
dare
to
empty
it
without
orders
as
it
contained
nothing
but
fine
red
glass
which
was
valuable
and
only
needed
melting
to
be
used
at
once
it
was
not
an
easy
matter
to
take
out
half
the
contents
and
he
was
in
constant
danger
of
interruption
at
night
it
would
have
been
impossible
owing
to
the
presence
of
the
boys
if
pasquale
appeared
and
saw
a
heap
of
broken
glass
on
the
floor
he
would
surely
suspect
something
zorzi
calculated
that
it
would
take
two
hours
to
remove
the
fragments
with
the
care
necessary
to
avoid
cutting
his
hands
badly
and
to
put
them
back
again
for
the
shape
of
the
jar
would
not
admit
of
his
employing
even
one
of
the
small
iron
shovels
used
for
filling
the
crucibles
with
considerable
difficulty
he
moved
a
large
chest
that
contained
sifted
white
sand
out
of
the
dark
corner
in
which
it
stood
and
placed
it
diagonally
so
as
to
leave
a
triangular
space
behind
it
to
guard
against
the
sound
of
the
broken
glass
being
heard
from
without
he
shut
the
window
in
spite
of
the
heat
and
having
arranged
in
the
corner
one
of
the
sacks
used
for
bringing
the
cakes
of
from
egypt
he
began
to
fill
it
with
the
broken
glass
he
brought
from
the
jar
in
a
bucket
when
he
judged
that
he
had
taken
out
more
than
half
the
contents
he
took
the
iron
box
from
the
annealing
oven
it
was
hard
to
carry
it
under
the
arm
by
which
he
walked
with
a
stick
the
other
hand
being
necessary
to
move
the
crutch
and
as
he
reached
the
jar
he
felt
that
it
was
slipping
he
bent
forward
and
it
fell
with
a
crash
bedding
itself
in
the
smashed
glass
zorzi
drew
a
long
breath
of
satisfaction
for
the
hardest
part
of
the
work
was
done
he
tried
to
heave
up
the
sack
from
the
corner
but
it
was
far
too
heavy
and
he
was
obliged
to
bring
back
more
than
half
of
what
it
held
by
bucketfuls
before
he
was
able
to
bring
the
rest
dragging
it
after
him
across
the
floor
it
was
finished
at
last
he
had
shaken
out
the
sack
carefully
over
the
jar
mouth
and
he
had
moved
the
back
to
its
original
position
no
one
would
have
imagined
that
the
broken
glass
had
been
removed
and
put
back
again
the
box
was
safely
hidden
now
he
was
utterly
exhausted
when
he
dropped
into
the
big
chair
after
washing
the
dust
and
blood
from
his
hands
for
it
had
been
impossible
to
do
what
he
had
done
without
getting
a
few
scratches
though
none
of
them
could
have
been
called
a
cut
he
sat
quite
still
and
closed
his
eyes
the
box
was
safe
now
it
was
not
to
be
imagined
that
any
one
should
ever
suspect
where
it
was
and
on
that
point
he
was
well
satisfied
his
only
possible
cause
of
anxiety
now
might
be
that
if
anything
should
happen
to
him
the
master
would
be
in
ignorance
of
what
he
had
done
but
he
saw
no
reason
to
expect
anything
so
serious
and
his
mind
was
at
rest
about
a
matter
which
had
much
disturbed
him
ever
since
giovanni
visit
the
plan
which
he
had
attributed
to
the
latter
was
not
however
the
one
which
suggested
itself
to
the
younger
beroviero
mind
it
would
have
been
easy
to
carry
out
and
was
very
simple
and
for
that
very
reason
giovanni
did
not
think
of
it
besides
in
his
estimation
it
would
be
better
to
act
in
such
a
way
as
to
get
rid
of
zorzi
for
ever
if
that
were
possible
on
the
saturday
night
after
zorzi
had
hidden
the
box
in
the
jar
the
workmen
cleared
away
the
litter
in
the
main
furnace
rooms
and
the
order
was
given
to
let
the
fires
go
out
zorzi
sent
word
to
the
night
boys
who
tended
the
fire
in
the
laboratory
that
they
were
to
come
as
usual
they
appeared
punctually
and
to
his
surprise
made
no
objection
to
working
though
he
had
expected
that
they
would
complain
of
the
heat
and
allege
that
their
fathers
would
not
let
them
go
on
any
longer
on
sunday
according
to
the
old
rule
of
the
house
no
work
was
done
and
zorzi
kept
up
the
fire
himself
spending
most
of
the
long
day
in
the
garden
on
sunday
night
the
boys
came
again
and
went
to
work
without
a
word
and
in
the
morning
they
left
the
usual
supply
of
chopped
billets
piled
up
and
ready
for
use
zorzi
had
rested
himself
thoroughly
and
went
back
to
his
experiments
on
that
monday
with
fresh
energy
the
very
first
test
he
took
of
the
glass
that
had
been
fusing
since
saturday
night
was
successful
beyond
his
highest
expectations
he
had
grown
reckless
after
having
spoiled
the
original
mixtures
by
adding
the
copper
in
the
hope
of
getting
more
of
the
wonderful
red
and
carried
away
by
the
love
of
the
art
and
by
the
certainty
of
ultimate
success
which
every
man
of
genius
feels
almost
from
boyhood
he
had
deliberately
attempted
to
produce
the
white
glass
for
which
beroviero
was
famous
he
followed
a
theory
of
his
own
in
doing
so
for
although
he
was
tolerably
sure
of
the
nature
of
the
ingredients
as
was
every
workman
in
the
house
neither
he
nor
they
knew
anything
of
the
proportions
in
which
beroviero
mixed
the
substances
and
every
knows
by
experience
that
those
proportions
constitute
by
far
the
most
important
element
of
success
zorzi
had
not
poured
out
the
specimen
on
the
table
as
he
had
done
when
the
glass
was
coloured
on
the
contrary
he
had
taken
some
on
the
and
had
begun
to
work
with
it
at
once
for
the
three
great
requisites
were
transparency
ductility
and
lightness
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
convinced
himself
that
his
glass
possessed
all
these
qualities
in
an
even
higher
degree
than
the
master
own
and
that
was
immeasurably
superior
to
anything
which
the
latter
own
sons
or
any
other
could
produce
zorzi
had
taken
very
little
at
first
and
he
made
of
it
a
thin
phial
of
graceful
shape
turned
the
mouth
outward
and
dropped
the
little
vessel
into
the
bed
of
ashes
he
would
have
set
it
in
the
annealing
oven
but
he
wished
to
try
the
weight
of
it
and
he
let
it
cool
taking
it
up
when
he
could
touch
it
safely
it
felt
in
his
hand
like
a
thing
of
air
on
the
shelf
was
another
nearly
like
it
in
size
which
he
had
made
long
ago
with
beroviero
glass
there
were
scales
on
the
table
he
laid
one
phial
in
each
and
the
old
one
was
by
far
the
heavier
he
had
to
put
a
number
of
pennyweights
into
the
scale
with
his
own
before
the
two
were
balanced
his
heart
almost
stood
still
and
he
could
not
believe
his
good
fortune
he
took
the
sheet
of
rough
paper
on
which
he
had
written
down
the
precise
contents
of
the
three
crucibles
and
he
carefully
went
over
the
proportions
of
the
ingredients
in
the
one
from
which
he
had
just
taken
his
specimen
he
made
a
strong
effort
of
memory
trying
to
recall
whether
he
had
been
careless
and
inexact
in
weighing
any
of
the
materials
but
he
knew
that
he
had
been
most
precise
he
had
also
noted
the
hour
at
which
he
had
put
the
mixture
into
the
crucible
on
saturday
and
he
now
glanced
at
the
and
made
another
note
but
he
did
not
lay
the
paper
upon
the
table
where
it
had
been
lying
for
two
days
kept
in
place
by
a
little
glass
weight
it
had
become
his
most
precious
possession
what
was
written
on
it
meant
a
fortune
as
soon
as
he
could
get
a
furnace
to
himself
it
was
his
own
and
not
the
master
it
was
wealth
it
might
even
be
fame
beroviero
might
call
him
to
account
for
misusing
the
furnace
but
that
was
no
capital
offence
after
all
and
it
was
more
than
paid
for
by
the
single
crucible
of
magnificent
red
glass
zorzi
was
attempting
to
reproduce
that
too
for
he
had
the
notes
of
what
the
pot
had
contained
and
it
was
almost
ready
to
be
tried
he
even
had
the
piece
of
copper
carefully
weighed
to
be
equal
in
bulk
with
the
ladle
that
had
been
melted
if
he
succeeded
there
also
that
was
a
new
secret
for
beroviero
but
the
other
was
for
himself
all
that
morning
he
revelled
in
the
delight
of
working
with
the
new
glass
a
marvellous
dish
with
upturned
edge
and
ornamented
foot
was
the
next
thing
he
made
and
he
placed
it
at
once
in
the
annealing
oven
then
he
made
a
tall
drinking
glass
such
as
he
had
never
made
before
and
then
in
contrast
a
tiny
ampulla
so
small
that
he
could
almost
hide
it
in
his
hand
with
its
spout
yet
decorated
with
all
the
perfection
of
a
larger
piece
he
worked
on
careless
of
the
time
his
genius
all
alive
the
rest
a
distant
dream
he
was
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
a
beaker
of
a
new
shape
when
the
door
opened
and
giovanni
entered
the
laboratory
zorzi
was
seated
on
the
working
stool
the
pontil
in
one
hand
the
in
the
other
he
glanced
at
giovanni
absently
and
went
on
for
it
was
the
last
touch
and
the
glass
was
cooling
quickly
still
working
in
this
heat
asked
giovanni
fanning
himself
with
his
cap
as
was
his
custom
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
a
sharp
clicking
sound
and
the
beaker
fell
finished
into
the
soft
ashes
yes
i
am
still
at
work
as
you
see
answered
zorzi
not
realising
that
giovanni
would
particularly
notice
what
he
was
doing
he
rose
with
some
difficulty
and
got
his
crutch
under
one
arm
with
a
forked
stick
he
took
the
beaker
from
the
ashes
and
placed
it
in
the
annealing
oven
giovanni
watched
him
and
when
the
broad
iron
door
was
open
he
saw
the
other
pieces
already
standing
inside
on
the
iron
tray
admirable
cried
giovanni
you
are
a
great
artist
my
dear
zorzi
there
is
no
one
like
you
i
do
what
i
can
answered
zorzi
closing
the
door
quickly
lest
the
hot
end
of
the
oven
should
cool
at
all
i
should
say
that
you
do
what
no
one
else
can
returned
giovanni
but
how
lame
you
are
i
had
expected
to
find
you
walking
as
well
as
ever
by
this
time
i
shall
never
walk
again
without
limping
oh
take
courage
said
giovanni
who
seemed
determined
to
be
both
cheerful
and
flattering
you
will
soon
be
as
light
on
your
feet
as
ever
but
it
was
a
shocking
accident
he
sat
down
in
the
big
chair
and
zorzi
took
the
small
one
by
the
table
wishing
that
he
would
go
away
it
is
a
pity
that
you
had
no
white
glass
in
the
furnace
on
that
particular
day
giovanni
continued
you
said
you
had
none
if
i
remember
how
is
it
that
you
have
it
now
have
you
changed
one
of
the
crucibles
yes
one
of
the
experiments
succeeded
so
well
that
it
seemed
better
to
take
out
all
the
glass
may
i
see
a
piece
of
it
inquired
giovanni
as
if
he
were
asking
a
great
favour
it
was
one
thing
to
let
him
test
the
glass
himself
it
was
quite
another
to
show
him
a
piece
of
it
he
would
see
it
sooner
or
later
and
he
could
guess
nothing
of
its
composition
the
specimen
is
there
on
the
table
zorzi
answered
giovanni
rose
at
once
and
took
the
piece
from
the
paper
on
which
it
lay
and
held
it
up
against
the
light
he
was
amazed
at
the
richness
of
the
colour
and
gave
vent
to
all
sorts
of
exclamations
did
you
make
this
he
asked
at
last
it
is
the
result
of
the
master
experiments
it
is
marvellous
he
has
made
another
fortune
giovanni
replaced
the
specimen
where
it
had
lain
and
as
he
did
so
his
eye
fell
on
the
phial
zorzi
had
made
that
morning
zorzi
had
not
put
it
into
the
annealing
oven
because
it
had
been
allowed
to
get
quite
cold
so
that
the
annealing
would
have
been
imperfect
giovanni
took
it
up
and
uttered
a
low
exclamation
of
surprise
at
its
lightness
he
held
it
up
and
looked
through
it
and
then
he
took
it
by
the
neck
and
tapped
it
sharply
with
his
take
care
said
zorzi
it
is
not
annealed
it
may
fly
oh
exclaimed
giovanni
have
you
just
made
it
yes
it
is
the
finest
glass
i
ever
saw
it
is
much
better
than
what
they
had
in
the
main
furnaces
the
day
you
were
hurt
did
you
not
find
it
so
yourself
in
working
with
it
zorzi
began
to
feel
anxious
as
to
the
result
of
so
much
questioning
whatever
happened
he
must
hide
from
giovanni
the
fact
that
he
had
discovered
a
new
glass
of
his
own
yes
he
answered
with
affected
indifference
i
thought
it
was
unusually
good
i
daresay
there
may
be
some
slight
difference
in
the
proportions
do
you
mean
to
say
that
my
father
does
not
follow
any
exact
rule
oh
yes
but
he
is
always
making
experiments
he
mixes
all
the
materials
for
the
main
furnaces
himself
does
he
not
inquired
giovanni
yes
he
does
it
alone
in
the
room
that
is
kept
locked
when
he
has
finished
the
men
come
and
carry
out
the
barrows
the
materials
are
stirred
and
mixed
together
outside
yes
i
do
it
in
the
same
way
myself
have
you
ever
helped
my
father
in
that
work
no
certainly
not
if
i
had
helped
him
once
i
should
know
the
secret
zorzi
smiled
but
if
you
do
not
know
the
secret
said
giovanni
unexpectedly
how
did
you
make
this
glass
he
held
up
the
phial
why
do
you
suppose
that
i
made
it
zorzi
felt
himself
growing
pale
the
master
has
supplies
of
everything
here
in
the
laboratory
and
in
the
little
room
where
i
sleep
is
there
white
glass
here
too
of
course
answered
zorzi
readily
there
is
half
a
jar
of
it
in
my
room
we
keep
it
there
so
that
the
night
boys
may
not
steal
it
a
little
at
a
time
i
see
answered
giovanni
that
is
very
sensible
he
was
firmly
convinced
that
if
he
asked
zorzi
any
more
direct
question
the
answer
would
be
a
falsehood
and
he
applauded
himself
for
stopping
at
the
point
he
had
reached
in
his
inquiries
for
he
was
an
experienced
and
was
perfectly
sure
that
the
phial
was
not
made
from
beroviero
ordinary
glass
it
followed
that
zorzi
had
used
the
precious
book
and
giovanni
inferred
that
the
rest
was
a
lucky
accident
will
you
sell
me
one
of
those
beautiful
things
you
have
in
the
oven
giovanni
asked
in
an
insinuating
tone
zorzi
hesitated
the
master
had
often
paid
him
a
fair
price
for
objects
he
had
made
and
which
were
used
in
beroviero
house
as
has
been
told
zorzi
did
not
wish
to
irritate
giovanni
by
refusing
and
after
all
there
was
no
great
difference
between
being
paid
by
old
beroviero
or
by
his
son
the
fact
that
he
worked
in
glass
which
had
been
an
open
secret
among
the
workmen
for
a
long
time
was
now
no
secret
at
all
the
question
was
rather
as
to
his
right
being
beroviero
trusted
assistant
to
sell
anything
out
of
the
house
will
you
asked
giovanni
after
waiting
a
few
moments
for
an
answer
i
would
rather
wait
until
the
master
comes
back
said
zorzi
doubtfully
i
am
not
quite
sure
about
it
i
will
take
all
the
responsibility
giovanni
answered
cheerfully
am
i
not
free
to
come
to
my
father
and
buy
a
beaker
or
a
dish
for
myself
if
i
please
of
course
i
am
but
there
is
no
real
difference
between
buying
from
you
on
one
side
of
the
garden
or
from
the
furnace
on
the
other
is
there
the
difference
is
that
in
the
one
case
you
buy
from
the
master
and
pay
him
but
now
you
are
offering
to
pay
me
who
am
already
well
paid
by
him
for
any
work
i
may
do
you
are
very
scrupulous
said
giovanni
in
a
disappointed
tone
tell
me
does
my
father
never
give
you
anything
for
the
things
you
make
and
which
you
say
are
in
the
house
oh
yes
answered
zorzi
promptly
he
always
pays
me
for
them
but
that
shows
that
he
does
not
consider
them
as
part
of
the
work
you
are
regularly
paid
to
do
does
it
not
i
suppose
so
zorzi
said
turning
over
the
question
in
his
mind
giovanni
took
a
small
piece
of
gold
from
the
purse
he
carried
at
his
belt
and
he
laid
it
on
the
flat
arm
of
the
chair
beside
him
and
put
down
one
of
his
crooked
forefingers
upon
it
i
can
not
see
what
objection
you
can
have
in
that
case
you
know
very
well
that
young
painters
who
work
for
masters
help
them
but
are
always
allowed
to
sell
anything
they
can
paint
in
their
leisure
time
yes
that
is
true
i
will
take
the
money
sir
and
you
may
choose
any
of
the
pieces
you
like
when
the
master
comes
i
will
tell
him
and
if
i
have
no
right
to
the
price
he
shall
keep
it
himself
do
you
really
suppose
that
my
father
would
be
mean
enough
to
take
the
money
asked
giovanni
who
would
certainly
have
taken
it
himself
under
the
circumstances
no
he
is
very
generous
nevertheless
i
shall
certainly
tell
him
the
whole
story
that
is
your
affair
i
have
nothing
to
say
about
it
here
is
the
money
for
which
i
will
take
the
beaker
i
saw
you
finishing
when
i
came
in
is
it
enough
is
it
a
fair
price
it
is
a
very
good
price
zorzi
answered
but
there
may
be
a
piece
among
those
in
the
oven
which
you
will
like
better
will
you
not
come
when
they
are
all
annealed
and
make
your
choice
no
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
the
piece
i
saw
you
making
very
well
you
shall
have
it
and
many
thanks
here
is
the
money
and
thanks
to
you
said
giovanni
holding
out
the
little
piece
of
gold
you
shall
pay
me
when
you
take
the
beaker
objected
zorzi
it
may
fly
or
turn
out
badly
no
no
answered
giovanni
rising
and
putting
the
money
into
hand
if
anything
happens
to
it
i
will
take
another
i
am
afraid
that
you
may
change
your
mind
you
see
and
i
am
very
anxious
to
have
such
a
beautiful
thing
he
laughed
cheerfully
nodded
to
zorzi
and
went
out
at
once
almost
before
the
latter
had
time
to
rise
from
his
seat
and
get
his
crutch
under
his
arm
when
he
was
alone
zorzi
looked
at
the
coin
and
laid
it
on
the
table
he
was
much
puzzled
by
giovanni
conduct
but
at
the
same
time
his
artist
vanity
was
flattered
by
what
had
happened
admiration
of
the
glass
was
genuine
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
that
and
he
was
a
good
judge
as
for
the
work
zorzi
knew
quite
well
that
there
was
not
a
in
murano
who
could
approach
him
either
in
taste
or
skill
old
beroviero
had
told
him
so
within
the
last
few
months
and
he
felt
that
it
was
true
he
would
have
been
neither
a
natural
man
nor
a
born
artist
if
he
had
refused
to
sell
the
beaker
out
of
an
exaggerated
scruple
but
the
transaction
had
shown
him
that
his
only
chance
of
success
for
the
future
lay
in
frankly
telling
old
beroviero
what
he
had
done
in
his
absence
while
reserving
his
secret
for
himself
the
master
was
proud
of
him
as
his
pupil
and
sincerely
attached
to
him
as
a
man
and
would
certainly
not
try
to
force
him
into
explaining
how
the
glass
was
made
besides
the
glass
itself
was
there
easily
distinguished
from
any
other
and
zorzi
could
neither
hide
it
nor
throw
it
away
giovanni
went
out
upon
the
footway
and
as
he
passed
pasquale
thought
he
had
never
seen
him
so
cheerful
the
sour
look
had
gone
out
of
his
face
and
he
was
actually
smiling
to
himself
with
such
a
man
it
would
hardly
have
been
possible
to
attribute
his
pleased
expression
to
the
satisfaction
he
felt
in
having
bought
zorzi
beaker
he
had
never
before
in
his
whole
life
parted
with
a
piece
of
gold
without
a
little
pang
of
regret
but
he
had
felt
the
most
keen
and
genuine
pleasure
just
now
when
zorzi
had
at
last
accepted
the
coin
pasquale
watched
him
cross
the
wooden
bridge
and
go
into
his
house
opposite
then
the
old
porter
shut
the
door
and
went
back
to
the
laboratory
walking
slowly
with
his
ugly
head
bent
a
little
as
if
in
deep
thought
zorzi
had
already
resumed
his
occupation
and
had
a
lump
of
hot
glass
swinging
on
his
his
crutch
being
under
his
right
arm
half
a
rainbow
to
windward
observed
the
old
sailor
there
will
be
a
squall
before
long
what
do
you
mean
asked
zorzi
if
you
had
seen
the
signor
giovanni
smile
as
he
went
out
you
would
know
what
i
mean
answered
pasquale
in
our
seas
when
we
see
the
stump
of
a
rainbow
low
down
in
the
clouds
we
say
it
is
the
eye
of
the
wind
looking
out
for
us
and
i
can
tell
you
that
the
wind
is
never
long
in
coming
did
you
say
anything
to
make
him
smile
asked
zorzi
going
on
with
his
work
i
am
not
a
mountebank
growled
the
porter
i
am
not
a
strolling
player
at
the
door
of
his
booth
at
a
fair
cracking
jokes
with
those
who
pass
but
perhaps
it
was
you
who
said
something
amusing
to
him
just
before
he
left
who
knows
i
always
took
you
for
a
grave
young
man
it
seems
that
i
was
mistaken
you
make
jokes
you
cause
a
serious
person
like
the
signor
giovanni
to
die
of
laughing
chapter
xv
giovanni
sat
in
his
father
own
room
at
home
with
shut
doors
and
he
was
writing
he
had
received
as
good
an
education
as
any
young
nobleman
or
rich
merchant
son
in
venice
but
writing
was
always
irksome
to
him
and
he
generally
employed
a
scribe
rather
than
take
the
pen
himself
he
preferred
to
dispense
with
help
instead
of
trusting
the
discretion
of
a
secretary
and
this
is
what
he
was
setting
down
i
giovanni
beroviero
the
son
of
angelo
of
murano
the
being
in
my
father
absence
and
in
his
stead
the
master
of
our
honourable
guild
of
do
entreat
your
magnificence
to
interfere
and
act
for
the
preservation
of
our
ancient
rights
and
privileges
and
for
the
maintenance
of
the
just
laws
of
venice
and
for
the
honour
of
the
republic
and
for
the
public
good
of
murano
there
is
a
certain
zorzi
called
the
ballarin
who
was
a
servant
of
the
aforesaid
angelo
beroviero
a
dalmatian
and
a
foreigner
and
a
fellow
of
no
worth
who
formerly
swept
the
floor
of
the
said
angelo
furnace
room
which
the
said
angelo
keeps
for
his
private
use
this
fellow
therefore
this
foreigner
the
said
angelo
being
absent
on
a
long
journey
was
left
by
him
to
watch
the
fire
in
the
said
room
there
being
certain
new
glass
in
the
crucibles
of
the
said
furnace
which
the
said
zorzi
called
the
ballarin
was
to
keep
hot
a
certain
number
of
days
and
now
in
the
torrid
heat
of
summer
the
canicular
days
being
at
hand
the
furnaces
in
the
of
the
said
angelo
have
been
extinguished
but
this
zorzi
called
the
ballarin
although
he
has
removed
from
the
furnace
of
the
said
angelo
the
glass
which
was
to
be
kept
hot
does
insolently
and
defiantly
refuse
to
put
out
the
fire
in
the
said
furnace
and
forces
the
boys
to
make
the
fire
all
night
to
the
great
injury
of
their
health
because
the
canicular
days
are
approaching
but
the
said
zorzi
called
the
ballarin
like
a
raging
devil
come
upon
earth
from
his
master
satan
heeds
no
heat
and
he
has
no
respect
of
laws
nor
of
persons
nor
of
the
honourable
guild
nor
of
the
republic
working
day
and
night
at
the
art
just
as
if
he
were
not
a
dalmatian
and
a
foreigner
and
a
low
fellow
of
no
worth
moreover
he
has
made
glass
himself
which
it
is
forbidden
for
any
foreigner
to
make
throughout
the
dominions
of
the
republic
moreover
it
is
a
good
white
glass
which
he
could
not
have
made
if
he
had
not
wickedly
secretly
and
feloniously
stolen
a
book
which
is
the
property
of
the
aforesaid
angelo
and
which
contains
many
things
concerning
the
making
of
glass
moreover
this
zorzi
called
the
ballarin
is
a
liar
a
thief
and
an
assassin
for
of
the
good
white
glass
which
he
has
melted
by
means
of
the
said
angelo
secrets
he
makes
vessels
such
as
phials
ampullas
and
dishes
which
it
is
not
lawful
for
any
foreigner
to
make
moreover
in
the
vile
wickedness
of
his
shameless
heart
the
said
zorzi
called
the
ballarin
has
the
presumption
and
effrontery
to
sell
the
said
vessels
openly
admitting
that
he
has
made
them
and
they
are
well
made
with
diabolical
skill
and
the
sale
of
the
said
vessels
is
a
great
injury
to
the
of
murano
and
to
the
honourable
guild
besides
being
an
affront
to
the
republic
i
the
aforesaid
giovanni
was
indeed
unable
to
believe
that
such
monstrous
wickedness
could
exist
i
therefore
went
into
the
furnace
room
myself
and
there
i
found
the
said
zorzi
called
the
ballarin
working
alone
and
making
a
certain
piece
in
the
form
of
a
beaker
and
though
he
knows
me
that
i
am
the
son
of
his
master
he
is
so
lost
to
all
shame
that
he
continued
to
work
before
me
as
if
he
were
a
and
though
i
fanned
myself
in
order
not
to
die
of
heat
he
worked
before
the
fire
and
felt
nothing
raging
like
a
devil
i
therefore
offered
to
buy
the
beaker
he
was
making
and
i
put
down
a
piece
of
money
and
the
said
zorzi
called
the
ballarin
a
liar
a
thief
and
an
assassin
took
the
said
piece
of
money
and
set
the
said
beaker
within
the
annealing
oven
of
the
said
furnace
wherein
i
saw
many
other
pieces
of
fine
workmanship
and
he
said
that
i
should
have
the
said
beaker
when
it
was
annealed
wherefore
i
being
for
the
time
the
master
of
the
honourable
guild
in
the
stead
of
the
said
angelo
entreat
your
magnificence
on
behalf
of
the
said
guild
to
interfere
and
act
for
the
preservation
of
our
ancient
rights
and
privileges
and
for
the
honour
of
the
republic
moreover
i
entreat
your
magnificence
to
send
a
force
by
night
in
order
that
there
may
be
no
scandal
to
take
the
said
zorzi
called
the
ballarin
and
to
bind
him
and
carry
him
to
venice
that
he
may
be
tried
for
his
monstrous
crimes
and
be
questioned
even
with
torture
as
to
others
which
he
has
certainly
committed
and
be
exiled
from
all
the
dominions
of
the
republic
for
ever
on
pain
of
being
hanged
that
in
this
way
our
laws
may
be
maintained
and
our
privileges
preserved
moreover
i
will
give
any
further
information
of
the
same
kind
which
your
magnificence
may
desire
at
murano
in
the
house
of
angelo
beroviero
my
father
this
third
day
of
july
in
the
year
of
the
salvation
of
the
world
fourteen
hundred
and
seventy
giovanni
beroviero
the
giovanni
had
taken
a
long
time
in
the
composition
of
this
remarkable
document
he
sat
in
his
linen
shirt
and
black
hose
but
he
had
paused
often
to
fan
himself
with
a
sheet
of
paper
and
to
wipe
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
for
although
he
was
a
lean
man
he
suffered
much
from
the
heat
owing
to
a
weakness
of
his
heart
he
folded
the
two
sheets
of
his
letter
and
tied
them
with
a
silk
string
of
which
he
squeezed
the
knot
into
pasty
red
wax
which
he
worked
with
his
fingers
and
upon
this
he
pressed
the
iron
seal
of
the
guild
using
both
his
hands
and
standing
up
in
order
to
add
his
weight
to
the
pressure
the
missive
was
destined
for
the
podestà
of
murano
which
is
to
say
for
the
governor
who
was
a
patrician
of
venice
and
a
most
high
and
mighty
personage
giovanni
did
not
mean
to
trust
to
any
messenger
that
very
afternoon
when
he
had
slept
after
dinner
and
the
sun
was
low
he
would
have
himself
rowed
to
the
governor
house
and
he
would
deliver
the
letter
himself
or
if
possible
he
would
see
the
dignitary
and
explain
even
more
fully
that
zorzi
called
the
ballarin
was
a
liar
a
thief
and
an
assassin
he
felt
a
good
deal
of
pride
in
what
he
had
written
so
carefully
and
he
was
sure
that
his
case
was
strong
in
another
day
or
two
zorzi
would
be
gone
for
ever
from
murano
giovanni
would
have
the
precious
manuscript
in
his
possession
and
when
old
beroviero
returned
giovanni
would
use
the
book
as
a
weapon
against
his
father
who
would
be
furiously
angry
to
find
his
favourite
assistant
gone
it
was
all
very
well
planned
he
thought
and
was
sure
to
succeed
he
would
even
take
possession
of
the
beautiful
red
glass
and
of
the
still
more
wonderful
white
glass
which
zorzi
had
made
for
himself
by
the
help
of
the
book
he
should
soon
be
able
to
produce
the
same
in
his
own
furnaces
the
vision
of
a
golden
future
opened
before
him
he
would
outdo
all
the
other
in
every
market
from
paris
to
palermo
from
distant
england
to
egyptian
alexandria
wheresoever
the
vast
trade
of
venice
carried
those
huge
bales
of
delicate
glass
carefully
packed
in
the
dried
seaweed
of
the
lagoons
gold
would
follow
gold
and
his
wealth
would
increase
till
it
became
greater
than
that
of
any
patrician
in
venice
who
could
tell
but
that
in
time
the
great
exception
might
be
made
for
him
and
he
might
be
admitted
to
sit
in
the
grand
council
he
and
his
heirs
for
ever
just
as
if
he
had
been
born
a
real
patrician
and
not
merely
a
member
of
the
caste
of
such
things
were
surely
possible
in
the
cooler
hours
of
the
afternoon
he
got
into
his
father
gondola
for
he
was
far
too
economical
to
keep
one
of
his
own
and
he
had
himself
rowed
to
the
house
of
the
governor
on
the
grand
canal
of
murano
but
at
the
door
he
was
told
that
the
official
was
in
venice
and
would
not
return
till
the
following
day
the
liveried
porter
was
not
sure
where
he
might
be
found
but
he
often
went
to
the
palace
of
the
contarini
who
were
his
near
relations
the
signor
giovanni
to
whom
the
porter
was
monstrously
civil
might
give
himself
the
fatigue
of
being
taken
there
in
his
gondola
in
any
case
it
would
be
easy
to
find
the
governor
he
would
perhaps
be
on
the
grand
canal
in
venice
at
the
hour
when
all
the
patricians
were
taking
the
air
it
was
very
probable
indeed
the
porter
bowed
low
as
the
gondola
pushed
off
and
giovanni
leaned
back
in
the
comfortable
seat
to
repeat
again
and
again
in
his
mind
what
he
meant
to
say
if
he
succeeded
in
speaking
with
the
governor
he
had
his
letter
of
complaint
safe
in
his
wallet
and
he
could
remember
every
word
he
had
written
in
order
to
go
to
venice
the
nearest
way
was
to
return
from
the
grand
canal
of
murano
by
the
canal
of
san
piero
and
to
pass
the
the
door
was
shut
as
usual
and
giovanni
smiled
as
he
thought
of
how
the
city
archers
would
go
in
perhaps
that
very
night
to
take
zorzi
away
he
would
not
be
with
them
but
when
they
were
gone
he
would
go
and
find
the
book
under
one
of
the
stones
when
he
had
got
it
his
father
might
come
home
for
all
giovanni
cared
before
long
the
gondola
was
winding
its
way
through
the
narrow
canals
now
shooting
swiftly
along
a
short
straight
stretch
between
a
monastery
and
a
palace
now
brought
to
by
a
turn
of
the
hand
at
a
corner
as
the
man
at
the
oar
shouted
out
a
direction
meant
for
whoever
might
be
coming
by
the
right
or
left
as
one
should
say
starboard
helm
or
port
helm
and
both
doing
the
same
two
vessels
pass
clear
of
one
another
and
to
this
day
the
gondoliers
of
venice
use
the
old
words
and
tell
stories
of
their
derivation
and
first
meaning
which
seem
quite
unnecessary
but
in
beroviero
time
the
gondola
had
only
lately
come
into
fashion
and
every
one
adopted
it
quickly
because
it
was
much
cheaper
than
keeping
horses
and
it
was
far
more
pleasant
to
be
taken
quickly
by
water
by
shorter
ways
than
to
ride
in
the
narrow
streets
in
the
mud
in
winter
and
in
the
dust
in
summer
jostling
those
who
walked
and
sometimes
quarrelling
with
those
who
rode
because
the
way
was
too
narrow
for
one
horse
to
pass
another
when
both
had
riders
on
their
backs
moreover
it
was
law
that
after
nine
in
the
morning
no
man
who
had
reached
the
that
grew
in
the
open
space
before
san
salvatore
should
ride
to
saint
mark
by
the
merceria
so
that
people
had
to
walk
the
rest
of
the
way
leaving
their
horses
to
grooms
the
gondola
was
therefore
a
great
convenience
besides
being
a
notable
economy
and
old
francesco
sansovino
says
that
in
his
day
which
was
within
a
lifetime
of
angelo
beroviero
there
were
nine
or
ten
thousand
gondolas
in
venice
but
at
first
they
had
not
the
high
peaked
stem
of
iron
and
stem
and
stern
were
made
almost
alike
as
in
the
venetian
boats
and
skiffs
of
our
own
time
giovanni
got
out
at
the
steps
of
the
contarini
palace
which
of
the
many
that
even
then
belonged
to
different
branches
of
that
great
house
was
distinguished
above
all
others
by
its
marvellous
outer
winding
staircase
which
still
stands
in
all
its
beauty
and
slender
grace
but
near
the
great
palace
there
were
little
wooden
houses
of
two
stories
some
new
and
straight
and
gaily
painted
but
some
old
and
crooked
hanging
over
the
canals
so
that
they
seemed
ready
to
topple
down
with
crazy
outer
balconies
half
closed
in
by
lattices
behind
which
the
women
sat
for
coolness
and
sometimes
even
slept
in
the
hot
months
for
the
great
city
of
stone
and
brick
was
not
half
built
yet
and
the
space
before
saint
mark
was
much
larger
than
it
is
now
for
the
procuratie
did
not
yet
exist
nor
the
clock
but
the
great
stood
almost
in
the
middle
of
an
open
square
and
there
were
little
wooden
booths
at
its
base
in
which
all
sorts
of
cheap
trinkets
were
sold
there
were
also
such
booths
and
small
shops
at
the
base
of
the
two
columns
also
the
bridge
of
rialto
was
a
broad
bridge
of
boats
on
which
shops
were
built
on
each
side
of
the
way
and
the
middle
of
the
bridge
could
be
drawn
out
for
the
great
bucentoro
to
pass
through
when
the
doge
went
out
in
state
to
wed
the
sea
giovanni
beroviero
was
well
known
to
contarini
household
for
all
knew
of
the
approaching
marriage
and
the
servants
were
not
surprised
when
he
inquired
for
the
governor
of
murano
saying
that
his
business
was
urgent
but
the
governor
was
not
there
nor
the
master
of
the
house
they
were
gone
to
the
grand
canal
would
the
signor
giovanni
like
to
speak
with
messer
jacopo
who
chanced
to
be
in
the
palace
and
alone
it
was
still
early
and
giovanni
thought
that
the
opportunity
was
a
good
one
for
ingratiating
himself
with
his
future
he
would
go
in
if
he
should
not
disturb
messer
jacopo
he
was
announced
and
ushered
respectfully
into
the
great
hall
and
thence
up
the
broad
staircase
to
the
hall
of
reception
above
and
below
his
gondoliers
gossiped
with
the
servants
talking
about
the
coming
marriage
and
many
indiscreet
things
were
said
which
it
was
better
that
their
masters
should
not
hear
as
for
instance
that
jacopo
was
really
living
in
the
house
of
the
agnus
dei
where
he
kept
a
beautiful
georgian
slave
in
luxury
and
that
this
was
a
great
grief
to
his
father
who
was
therefore
very
desirous
of
hastening
the
marriage
with
marietta
the
porter
winked
one
eye
solemnly
at
the
head
gondolier
as
who
should
imply
that
the
establishment
at
the
agnus
dei
would
not
be
given
up
for
twenty
marriages
but
the
gondolier
said
boldly
that
if
jacopo
did
not
change
his
life
after
he
had
married
marietta
something
would
happen
to
him
upon
this
the
porter
inquired
superciliously
what
in
the
name
of
a
great
many
beings
celestial
and
infernal
could
possibly
happen
to
any
contarini
who
chose
to
do
as
he
pleased
the
gondolier
answered
that
there
were
laws
the
porter
retorted
that
the
laws
were
made
for
but
not
for
patricians
and
the
two
might
have
come
to
blows
if
they
had
not
just
then
heard
their
masters
voices
from
the
landing
of
the
great
staircase
and
of
coarse
it
was
far
more
important
to
overhear
all
they
could
of
the
conversation
than
to
quarrel
about
a
point
of
law
giovanni
was
too
full
of
his
plan
for
zorzi
destruction
to
resist
the
temptation
of
laying
the
whole
case
before
contarini
who
was
so
soon
to
be
a
member
of
the
family
and
as
jacopo
who
was
himself
going
out
accompanied
his
guest
downstairs
giovanni
continued
to
talk
of
the
matter
earnestly
and
contarini
answered
him
by
occasional
monosyllables
and
short
sentences
much
interested
by
the
whole
affair
but
wishing
that
giovanni
would
go
away
now
that
he
had
told
all
he
was
in
constant
fear
lest
zorzi
should
say
something
which
might
betray
the
meetings
at
the
house
of
the
agnus
dei
and
had
often
regretted
that
he
had
not
been
put
quietly
out
of
the
way
instead
of
being
admitted
to
the
society
now
after
hearing
what
giovanni
had
to
say
he
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
but
that
zorzi
had
really
broken
the
laws
and
it
seemed
an
admirable
solution
of
the
whole
affair
that
the
dalmatian
should
be
exiled
from
the
republic
for
life
that
being
settled
he
wished
to
get
rid
of
his
visitor
as
arisa
was
waiting
for
him
i
assure
you
giovanni
said
that
this
miserable
zorzi
is
a
liar
a
thief
and
an
assassin
yes
assented
contarini
carelessly
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
the
best
thing
is
to
arrest
him
at
once
this
very
night
if
possible
and
have
him
brought
before
the
council
yes
contarini
had
agreed
with
giovanni
on
this
point
already
and
made
a
movement
to
descend
but
giovanni
loved
to
stand
still
in
order
to
talk
and
he
would
not
move
contarini
waited
for
him
it
is
important
that
some
member
of
the
council
should
be
informed
of
the
truth
beforehand
he
continued
will
you
speak
to
your
father
about
it
messer
jacopo
yes
answered
contarini
and
he
spoke
the
word
intentionally
with
great
emphasis
in
the
hope
that
giovanni
would
be
finally
satisfied
and
go
away
you
will
be
conferring
a
benefit
on
the
city
of
murano
said
giovanni
in
a
tone
of
gratitude
and
this
time
he
began
to
come
down
the
steps
the
gondolier
had
heard
every
word
that
had
been
said
as
well
as
the
servants
in
the
lower
hall
but
to
them
the
conversation
had
no
especial
meaning
as
they
knew
nothing
of
zorzi
to
the
gondolier
on
the
other
hand
who
was
devoted
to
his
master
and
detested
his
master
son
it
meant
much
though
his
stolid
face
did
not
betray
the
slightest
intelligence
giovanni
took
leave
of
contarini
with
much
ceremony
a
little
too
much
jacopo
thought
to
the
grand
canal
said
giovanni
as
the
gondolier
helped
him
to
get
in
and
he
backed
under
the
try
and
find
the
governor
of
murano
and
if
you
see
him
take
me
alongside
his
gondola
the
sun
was
now
low
and
as
the
light
craft
shot
out
at
last
upon
the
grand
canal
the
breeze
came
up
from
the
land
cool
and
refreshing
scores
of
gondolas
were
moving
up
and
down
some
with
the
black
some
without
and
in
the
latter
there
were
beautiful
women
whose
hair
shone
resplendent
under
the
thin
embroidered
veils
that
loosely
covered
it
they
wore
silk
and
satin
of
rich
hues
and
jewels
and
some
were
clad
in
bodices
that
were
nets
of
thin
gold
cord
drawn
close
over
velvet
with
lawn
sleeves
gathered
to
the
and
the
by
netting
of
seed
pearls
beside
some
of
them
sat
their
husbands
or
their
fathers
in
robes
and
mantles
of
satin
and
silk
or
in
wide
coats
of
rich
stuff
open
at
the
neck
bearded
men
and
often
very
pale
wearing
great
puffed
caps
set
far
back
on
their
smooth
hair
their
white
hands
playing
with
their
gloves
their
dark
eyes
searching
out
from
afar
the
faces
of
famous
beauties
or
if
they
were
men
fixed
thoughtfully
before
them
overall
the
evening
light
descended
like
a
mist
of
gold
reflected
from
the
sculptured
walls
of
palaces
where
marble
columns
and
light
traceries
of
stone
were
dyed
red
and
orange
and
almost
purple
by
the
setting
sun
and
nestling
among
the
carved
beams
and
balconies
of
wooden
houses
that
overhung
the
canal
gilding
the
water
itself
where
the
oars
struck
deep
and
churned
it
and
swept
aft
and
steered
with
a
poising
feathering
backstroke
or
where
tiny
waves
were
dashed
up
by
a
gondola
bright
iron
stem
slowly
the
water
turned
to
wine
below
the
clear
outlines
of
the
palaces
stood
out
less
sharply
against
the
paling
sky
the
golden
cloudlets
floating
behind
the
great
tower
of
saint
mark
presently
faded
to
wreaths
of
delicate
mist
the
bells
rung
out
from
church
and
monastery
far
and
near
till
the
air
was
filled
with
a
deep
music
telling
all
venice
that
the
day
was
done
then
the
many
voices
that
had
echoed
in
greeting
and
in
laughter
from
boat
to
boat
were
hushed
a
moment
and
almost
every
man
took
off
his
hat
or
cap
the
robed
councillor
and
the
gondolier
behind
him
and
also
a
good
number
of
the
great
ladies
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
were
silent
a
while
it
was
the
hour
when
venice
puts
forth
her
stealing
charm
when
the
terrible
distinctness
of
her
splendour
grows
gentle
and
almost
human
and
the
little
mystery
of
each
young
life
rises
from
the
heart
to
hold
converse
with
the
sweet
mysterious
all
through
the
long
day
the
palaces
look
down
consciously
at
themselves
mirrored
in
the
calm
water
where
they
stand
and
each
seems
to
say
i
am
finer
than
you
or
my
master
is
still
richer
than
yours
or
you
are
going
to
ruin
faster
than
i
am
or
i
was
built
by
a
lombardo
or
i
by
sansovino
and
the
violent
light
is
ever
there
to
bear
witness
of
the
truth
of
what
each
says
within
without
in
hall
and
church
and
gallery
there
is
perpetual
brightness
and
perpetual
silence
but
at
the
evening
hour
now
as
in
old
times
a
spirit
takes
venice
and
folds
it
in
loving
arms
whispering
words
that
are
not
even
guessed
by
day
the
ave
maria
had
not
ceased
ringing
when
giovanni
gondolier
came
up
with
the
governor
of
murano
he
was
alone
and
at
his
invitation
giovanni
left
his
own
craft
and
sat
down
beside
the
patrician
whose
gondola
was
uncovered
for
coolness
giovanni
talked
earnestly
in
low
tones
holding
his
sealed
letter
in
his
hand
while
his
own
oarsman
watched
him
closely
in
the
advancing
dusk
but
was
too
wise
to
try
to
overhear
what
was
said
he
knew
well
enough
now
what
giovanni
wanted
of
the
governor
and
what
he
obtained
not
the
governor
said
audibly
as
giovanni
returned
to
his
own
gondola
giovanni
turned
before
getting
under
the
bowed
low
as
he
stood
up
and
said
a
few
words
of
thanks
which
the
governor
could
hardly
have
heard
as
his
boat
shot
ahead
though
he
made
one
more
gracious
gesture
with
his
hand
the
shadows
descended
quickly
now
and
everywhere
the
little
lights
came
out
from
latticed
balconies
and
palace
windows
left
open
to
let
in
the
cool
air
and
from
the
silently
gliding
gondolas
that
each
carried
a
small
lamp
and
here
and
there
between
tall
houses
the
young
summer
moon
fell
across
the
black
water
rippling
under
the
freshening
breeze
and
it
was
like
a
shower
of
silver
falling
into
a
widow
lap
but
giovanni
saw
none
of
these
things
and
if
he
had
looked
out
of
the
small
windows
of
the
he
would
not
have
cared
to
see
them
for
beauty
did
not
appeal
to
him
in
nature
any
more
than
in
art
except
that
in
the
latter
it
was
a
cause
of
value
in
things
besides
as
he
suffered
from
the
heat
all
day
he
was
afraid
of
being
chilled
at
evening
so
he
sat
inside
the
gloating
over
the
success
of
his
trip
the
governor
who
knew
nothing
of
zorzi
but
was
well
aware
of
importance
in
murano
had
readily
consented
to
arrest
the
poor
dalmatian
who
was
represented
as
such
a
dangerous
person
besides
being
a
liar
and
other
things
and
giovanni
had
particularly
requested
that
the
force
sent
should
be
sufficient
to
overpower
the
raging
devil
at
once
and
without
scandal
he
judged
that
ten
men
would
suffice
for
this
he
said
the
fact
was
that
he
feared
some
resistance
on
the
part
of
pasquale
whom
he
knew
to
be
a
friend
to
zorzi
he
had
carefully
abstained
from
alluding
to
zorzi
lameness
lest
the
mere
mention
of
it
should
excite
some
compassion
in
his
hearer
he
had
in
fact
done
everything
to
assure
the
success
of
his
scheme
except
the
one
thing
which
was
the
most
necessary
of
all
he
had
allowed
himself
to
speak
of
it
in
the
hearing
of
the
gondolier
who
hated
him
and
who
lost
no
time
in
making
use
of
the
information
it
was
nearly
when
he
deposited
giovanni
at
the
steps
of
the
house
and
took
the
gondola
round
to
the
narrow
canal
in
which
the
boats
lay
and
which
was
under
nella
window
the
shutters
were
wide
open
and
there
was
a
light
within
he
called
the
by
name
and
she
looked
out
and
asked
what
he
wanted
then
as
now
gondoliers
worked
indoors
like
the
servants
when
not
busy
with
the
boats
and
slept
in
the
house
the
man
was
on
friendly
terms
with
nella
who
liked
him
because
he
thought
her
mistress
the
most
perfect
creature
in
the
world
i
have
ripped
the
arm
of
my
doublet
he
said
can
you
mend
it
for
me
this
evening
bring
it
up
to
me
now
answered
nella
there
is
time
before
supper
you
can
wait
outside
my
room
while
i
do
it
my
mistress
is
already
gone
downstairs
you
are
an
angel
observed
the
gondolier
from
below
the
only
thing
you
need
is
a
husband
you
have
guessed
wrong
answered
nella
with
a
little
laugh
that
is
the
only
thing
i
do
not
need
she
disappeared
and
the
gondolier
went
round
by
the
back
of
the
house
to
the
side
door
in
order
to
go
upstairs
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
while
she
stood
in
her
doorway
and
he
in
the
passage
without
he
had
told
her
all
he
knew
of
giovanni
evil
intentions
against
zorzi
including
the
few
words
which
the
governor
had
spoken
audibly
the
torn
sleeve
was
an
invention
giovanni
was
visibly
elated
at
supper
a
circumstance
which
pleased
his
wife
but
inspired
marietta
with
some
distrust
she
had
never
felt
any
sympathy
for
the
brother
who
was
so
much
older
than
herself
and
who
took
a
view
of
things
which
seemed
to
her
sordid
and
she
did
not
like
to
see
him
sitting
in
her
father
place
often
talking
of
the
house
as
if
it
were
already
his
and
dictating
to
her
upon
matters
of
conduct
as
well
as
upon
questions
of
taste
everything
he
said
jarred
on
her
but
as
yet
she
had
no
idea
that
he
had
any
plans
against
zorzi
and
being
of
a
reserved
character
she
often
took
no
trouble
to
answer
what
he
said
except
to
bend
her
head
a
little
to
acknowledge
that
he
had
said
it
when
she
was
alone
with
her
father
she
loved
to
sit
with
him
after
supper
in
the
big
room
working
by
the
clear
light
of
the
olive
oil
lamp
while
he
sat
in
his
great
chair
and
talked
to
her
of
his
work
he
had
told
her
far
more
than
he
realised
of
his
secret
processes
as
well
as
of
his
experiments
and
she
had
remembered
it
for
she
alone
of
his
children
had
inherited
his
true
love
and
understanding
of
the
noble
art
of
but
now
that
he
was
away
giovanni
generally
spent
the
evening
in
instructing
his
wife
how
to
save
money
and
she
listened
meekly
enough
to
what
he
told
her
for
she
was
a
modest
little
woman
of
colourless
character
brought
up
to
have
no
great
opinion
of
herself
though
her
father
was
a
rich
merchant
and
she
looked
upon
her
husband
as
belonging
to
a
superior
class
marietta
found
the
conversation
intolerable
and
she
generally
left
the
couple
together
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
supper
was
over
and
went
to
her
own
room
where
she
worked
a
little
and
listened
to
nella
prattle
and
sometimes
answered
her
she
was
living
in
a
state
of
thought
and
was
glad
to
let
the
time
pass
as
it
would
provided
it
passed
at
all
this
evening
as
usual
she
bade
her
brother
and
his
wife
good
night
and
went
upstairs
nella
had
learned
to
expect
her
and
was
waiting
for
her
to
her
surprise
nella
shut
the
window
as
soon
as
she
entered
leave
it
open
she
said
it
is
hot
this
evening
why
did
you
shut
it
you
never
do
a
window
is
an
ear
answered
nella
mysteriously
the
nights
are
still
and
voices
carry
far
what
great
secret
are
you
going
to
talk
of
inquired
marietta
with
a
careless
smile
as
she
drew
the
long
pins
from
her
hair
and
let
the
heavy
braids
fall
behind
her
bad
news
bad
news
nella
repeated
the
young
master
is
doing
things
which
he
ought
not
to
do
because
they
are
very
unjust
and
spiteful
i
am
only
a
poor
but
i
would
bite
off
my
fingers
like
this
and
she
bit
them
sharply
and
shook
them
before
i
would
let
them
do
such
things
what
do
you
mean
nella
asked
marietta
you
must
not
speak
of
my
brother
in
that
way
your
brother
eh
your
brother
cried
nella
in
a
low
and
angry
voice
quite
unlike
her
own
do
you
know
what
your
brother
has
done
he
has
been
to
messer
jacopo
contarini
your
betrothed
husband
and
he
has
told
him
that
zorzi
is
a
liar
a
thief
and
an
assassin
and
that
he
will
have
him
arrested
if
he
can
and
messer
jacopo
promised
that
his
father
who
is
of
the
council
shall
have
zorzi
condemned
and
your
brother
has
seen
the
governor
of
murano
in
venice
and
has
given
him
a
great
letter
and
the
governor
said
that
it
should
not
be
but
that
is
the
sort
of
man
your
brother
is
marietta
was
standing
she
had
turned
slowly
pale
while
nella
was
speaking
and
grasped
the
back
of
a
chair
with
both
hands
she
thought
she
was
going
to
faint
chapter
xvi
marrietta
heart
stood
still
as
she
bent
over
the
back
of
the
chair
holding
it
with
both
her
hands
but
feeling
that
she
was
falling
she
had
expected
anything
but
this
when
nella
had
begun
to
speak
the
blow
was
sudden
and
heavy
and
she
herself
had
never
known
how
much
she
could
be
hurt
until
that
moment
nella
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
the
had
changed
her
mind
about
zorzi
of
late
and
had
grown
fond
of
him
in
taking
care
of
him
but
her
anger
against
giovanni
was
roused
rather
because
what
he
was
about
to
do
was
an
affront
to
his
father
her
master
than
out
of
mere
sympathy
for
the
intended
victim
she
was
far
from
understanding
what
could
have
so
deeply
moved
marietta
you
see
she
said
triumphantly
what
sort
of
a
brother
you
have
the
sound
of
her
voice
recalled
the
young
girl
just
when
she
felt
that
she
was
losing
consciousness
her
first
instinct
was
to
go
to
zorzi
and
warn
him
he
must
escape
at
once
the
governor
had
said
that
it
should
be
but
he
might
change
his
mind
and
send
his
men
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
she
must
go
instantly
as
she
stood
upright
she
could
see
the
porter
light
shining
through
the
small
grated
window
for
pasquale
was
still
awake
but
in
a
few
minutes
the
light
would
go
out
she
had
often
been
at
her
own
window
at
that
hour
and
had
watched
it
wondering
whether
zorzi
would
work
far
into
the
night
and
whether
he
was
thinking
of
her
it
would
be
easy
to
slip
out
by
the
side
door
and
run
across
no
one
would
know
except
nella
and
pasquale
but
she
would
have
preferred
that
only
the
latter
should
be
in
the
secret
she
was
still
dressed
though
her
hair
was
undone
and
the
hood
of
a
thin
silk
mantle
would
hide
that
her
mind
reasoned
by
instantaneous
flashes
now
and
she
had
full
control
of
herself
again
she
would
tell
nella
that
she
was
going
downstairs
again
for
a
little
while
and
she
would
also
tell
her
to
make
an
infusion
of
lime
flowers
and
to
bring
it
in
half
an
hour
and
wait
for
her
down
the
main
staircase
to
the
landing
down
the
narrow
stairs
in
the
dark
out
into
the
street
it
would
not
take
long
and
she
would
tap
very
softly
at
the
door
of
the
when
she
said
that
she
would
go
down
again
nella
suspected
nothing
on
the
contrary
she
thought
her
mistress
was
wise
you
will
lead
on
the
signor
giovanni
to
talk
of
zorzi
she
said
you
will
learn
something
and
make
me
a
drink
of
lime
flowers
continued
marietta
the
housekeeper
has
plenty
i
know
i
know
answered
nella
shall
you
come
up
again
soon
be
here
in
half
an
hour
with
the
drink
and
wait
for
me
you
had
better
go
for
the
lime
flowers
before
the
housekeeper
is
asleep
i
will
twist
my
hair
up
again
before
i
go
down
nella
nodded
and
disappeared
for
the
housekeeper
generally
went
to
bed
very
early
as
soon
as
she
was
out
of
the
room
marietta
took
her
silk
cloak
and
wrapped
herself
in
it
drawing
the
end
over
her
head
so
as
to
hide
her
hair
and
shade
her
face
she
was
pale
still
but
her
lips
were
tightly
closed
and
her
eyelids
a
little
drawn
together
as
she
left
the
room
she
met
no
one
on
the
stairs
in
the
dark
when
she
reached
the
door
she
could
feel
the
oak
bar
that
was
set
across
it
at
night
and
she
slipped
it
back
into
its
hole
in
the
wall
without
making
much
noise
she
lifted
the
latch
and
went
out
the
night
was
still
and
clear
and
the
young
moon
was
setting
if
any
one
had
been
looking
out
she
must
have
been
seen
as
she
crossed
the
wooden
bridge
and
she
glanced
nervously
back
at
the
open
windows
there
were
lights
in
the
big
room
and
she
heard
giovanni
monotonous
voice
as
he
talked
to
his
wife
but
there
was
shadow
under
the
and
a
moment
later
she
was
tapping
softly
at
the
door
pasquale
looked
down
from
the
grating
and
was
about
to
say
something
uncomplimentary
when
he
recognised
her
for
he
could
see
very
well
when
there
was
little
light
like
most
sailors
he
opened
the
door
at
once
and
stood
aside
to
let
marietta
enter
shut
the
door
quickly
she
whispered
and
do
not
open
it
for
anybody
till
i
come
out
pasquale
obeyed
in
silence
he
knew
as
well
as
she
did
that
giovanni
was
sitting
in
the
big
room
with
open
windows
within
easy
hearing
of
ordinary
sounds
a
feeble
light
came
through
the
open
door
of
the
porter
lodge
is
zorzi
awake
marietta
asked
in
a
low
tone
when
both
had
gone
a
few
steps
down
the
corridor
yes
he
will
sleep
little
for
the
boys
have
not
come
and
he
must
tend
the
fire
himself
marietta
guessed
that
her
brother
had
given
the
order
so
that
zorzi
might
be
left
quite
alone
pasquale
she
said
i
can
trust
you
i
am
sure
you
are
a
good
friend
to
zorzi
the
porter
growled
something
incoherent
but
she
understood
what
he
meant
yes
she
continued
i
trust
you
and
you
must
trust
me
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
speak
with
zorzi
alone
no
one
knows
that
i
have
left
the
house
and
no
one
must
know
that
i
have
been
here
the
old
sailor
had
seen
much
in
his
day
but
he
was
profoundly
astonished
at
marietta
audacity
you
are
the
mistress
he
said
in
a
grave
and
quiet
voice
that
marietta
had
never
heard
before
but
i
am
an
old
man
and
i
can
not
help
telling
you
that
it
is
not
seemly
for
a
young
girl
to
be
alone
at
night
with
a
young
man
in
the
place
where
he
lives
you
will
forgive
me
for
saying
so
because
i
have
served
your
father
a
long
time
you
are
quite
right
answered
marietta
but
in
matters
of
life
and
death
there
is
nothing
seemly
or
unseemly
i
have
not
time
to
explain
all
this
zorzi
is
in
great
danger
for
my
father
sake
i
must
warn
him
and
i
can
not
stay
out
long
not
even
nella
must
know
that
i
am
here
be
ready
to
let
me
out
she
almost
ran
down
the
corridor
to
the
garden
the
moon
was
already
too
low
to
shine
upon
the
walk
but
the
beams
silvered
the
higher
leaves
of
the
and
all
was
clear
and
distinct
even
in
her
haste
she
glanced
at
the
place
where
she
had
so
often
sat
before
her
life
had
began
to
change
there
was
a
strong
light
in
the
laboratory
and
the
window
was
open
she
looked
in
and
saw
zorzi
sitting
in
the
great
chair
his
head
leaning
back
and
his
eyes
closed
he
was
so
pale
and
worn
that
she
felt
a
sharp
pain
as
her
eyes
fell
on
his
face
his
crutch
was
beside
him
and
he
seemed
to
be
asleep
it
was
a
pity
to
wake
him
she
thought
yet
she
could
not
lose
time
she
had
lost
too
much
already
in
talking
with
pasquale
zorzi
she
called
him
softly
he
started
in
his
sleep
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
tried
to
spring
up
without
his
crutch
for
he
fancied
himself
in
a
dream
she
had
thrown
back
the
drapery
that
covered
her
head
and
the
bright
light
fell
upon
her
face
it
hurt
her
again
to
see
how
he
staggered
and
put
out
his
hand
for
his
accustomed
support
i
am
coming
in
she
said
quietly
do
not
move
unless
the
door
is
locked
she
met
him
before
he
was
half
across
the
room
instinctively
she
put
out
her
hand
to
help
him
back
to
his
chair
then
she
understood
that
he
did
not
need
it
for
he
was
much
better
now
she
saw
that
he
looked
to
the
window
expecting
to
see
nella
and
she
smiled
i
am
alone
she
said
you
see
how
i
trust
you
only
pasquale
knows
that
i
am
here
you
must
sit
down
and
i
will
sit
beside
you
for
i
have
much
to
say
he
looked
at
her
in
silent
wonder
for
a
moment
happy
beyond
words
to
be
with
her
but
very
anxious
as
to
the
reasons
which
could
have
brought
her
to
him
at
such
an
hour
and
quite
alone
her
manner
was
so
quiet
and
decided
that
it
did
not
even
occur
to
him
to
protest
against
her
coming
and
he
sat
down
as
she
bade
him
but
on
the
bench
and
she
seated
herself
in
the
chair
turning
in
it
so
that
she
could
see
his
face
they
were
near
enough
to
speak
in
low
tones
my
brother
giovanni
hates
you
she
began
he
means
to
ruin
you
if
he
can
before
my
father
comes
home
i
am
not
afraid
of
him
said
zorzi
speaking
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
entered
let
him
do
his
worst
you
do
not
know
what
his
worst
is
answered
marietta
and
he
has
got
messer
jacopo
contarini
to
help
him
you
are
surprised
yes
my
betrothed
husband
has
promised
to
speak
with
his
father
against
you
at
once
you
know
that
he
is
of
the
council
zorzi
face
expressed
the
utmost
astonishment
are
you
quite
sure
that
it
is
jacopo
contarini
he
asked
as
if
unable
to
believe
what
she
said
is
it
likely
that
i
should
be
mistaken
my
brother
was
with
him
this
afternoon
at
the
palace
our
gondolier
heard
them
talking
on
the
stairs
as
they
came
down
he
told
nella
and
she
has
just
told
me
giovanni
heaped
all
sorts
of
abuse
on
you
and
messer
jacopo
agreed
with
all
he
said
then
they
spoke
of
arresting
you
and
bringing
you
to
justice
and
they
talked
of
the
council
after
that
giovanni
met
the
governor
of
murano
and
got
into
his
gondola
and
they
talked
in
a
low
tone
my
brother
gave
him
a
sealed
document
and
the
governor
said
that
it
should
not
be
but
that
is
all
i
know
but
it
is
enough
zorzi
half
closed
his
eyes
for
a
moment
in
deep
thought
and
in
a
flash
he
understood
that
contarini
wished
him
out
of
the
way
and
was
taking
the
first
means
that
offered
to
get
rid
of
him
to
keep
faith
with
such
a
man
would
be
as
foolish
as
to
expect
any
faithfulness
from
him
zorzi
opened
his
eyes
again
and
looked
at
the
face
of
the
woman
he
loved
his
oath
to
the
society
had
stood
between
him
and
her
and
he
knew
that
it
was
no
longer
binding
on
him
since
jacopo
contarini
was
helping
to
send
him
to
destruction
yet
now
that
it
was
gone
he
saw
also
that
it
had
been
the
least
of
the
obstacles
that
made
up
the
barrier
of
what
do
they
accuse
me
he
asked
after
a
moment
silence
what
can
they
prove
against
me
i
can
not
tell
it
matters
very
little
do
you
understand
if
not
the
governor
men
will
come
here
to
arrest
you
and
if
you
have
not
escaped
you
will
be
imprisoned
and
taken
before
the
council
they
may
accuse
you
of
being
involved
in
a
conspiracy
they
may
torture
you
she
shivered
at
the
thought
and
looked
into
his
dark
eyes
with
fear
and
pity
his
lip
curled
a
little
disdainfully
do
you
think
that
i
shall
run
away
he
asked
you
will
not
stay
here
and
let
them
arrest
you
cried
marietta
anxiously
your
father
left
me
here
to
take
care
of
what
belongs
to
him
and
there
is
much
that
is
valuable
i
thank
you
very
much
for
warning
me
but
i
know
what
your
brother
means
to
do
and
i
shall
not
go
away
of
my
own
accord
if
he
can
have
me
taken
off
by
force
he
will
come
here
alone
and
search
the
place
if
he
searches
long
enough
he
may
find
what
he
wants
is
paolo
godi
manuscript
in
this
room
asked
marietta
quietly
zorzi
stared
at
her
in
surprise
how
did
you
know
that
your
father
left
it
with
me
he
asked
he
would
not
have
entrusted
it
to
any
one
else
that
is
natural
my
brother
wants
it
is
that
the
reason
why
you
will
not
escape
or
is
there
any
other
that
is
the
principal
reason
answered
zorzi
another
is
that
there
is
valuable
glass
here
which
your
brother
would
take
which
he
would
steal
said
marietta
bitterly
but
pasquale
can
bury
it
in
the
garden
after
you
are
gone
the
principal
thing
is
the
book
give
it
to
me
i
will
take
care
of
it
till
my
father
comes
back
until
then
you
must
hide
somewhere
for
it
is
madness
to
stay
here
give
me
the
book
and
let
me
take
it
away
at
once
i
can
not
give
it
to
you
zorzi
said
with
a
puzzled
expression
which
marietta
did
not
understand
you
do
not
trust
me
she
answered
sadly
he
did
not
reply
at
once
for
the
words
made
no
impression
on
him
when
he
heard
them
he
trusted
her
altogether
but
there
was
a
material
difficulty
in
the
way
he
remembered
how
long
it
had
taken
to
hide
the
iron
box
under
broken
glass
and
he
knew
how
long
it
would
take
to
get
it
out
again
marietta
could
not
stay
in
the
laboratory
late
into
the
night
and
yet
if
she
did
not
take
the
box
with
her
now
she
might
not
be
able
to
take
it
at
all
since
neither
she
nor
nella
could
have
carried
it
to
the
house
by
day
without
being
seen
marietta
rested
her
elbow
on
the
arm
of
the
big
chair
and
her
hand
supported
her
chin
in
an
attitude
of
thought
as
she
looked
steadily
at
zorzi
face
and
her
own
was
grave
and
sad
you
never
trusted
me
she
said
presently
yet
i
have
been
a
good
friend
to
you
have
i
not
a
friend
oh
much
more
than
that
zorzi
turned
his
eyes
from
her
i
trust
you
with
all
my
heart
she
shook
her
head
incredulously
if
you
trusted
me
you
would
do
what
i
ask
she
said
i
have
risked
something
to
help
you
perhaps
to
save
your
life
who
knows
do
you
know
what
would
happen
if
my
brother
found
me
here
alone
with
you
i
should
end
my
life
in
a
convent
but
if
you
will
not
save
yourself
i
might
as
well
not
have
come
i
would
give
you
the
book
if
i
could
answered
zorzi
but
i
can
not
it
is
hidden
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
take
a
long
time
to
get
it
out
that
is
the
simple
truth
your
father
and
i
had
buried
it
here
under
the
stones
but
somehow
your
brother
suspected
that
and
i
have
changed
the
it
took
a
whole
morning
to
do
it
still
marietta
did
not
quite
believe
that
he
could
not
give
it
to
her
if
he
chose
it
seemed
as
if
there
must
always
be
a
shadow
between
them
when
they
were
together
always
the
beginning
of
a
misunderstanding
where
is
it
she
asked
after
a
moment
hesitation
if
you
are
in
earnest
you
will
tell
me
it
is
better
that
you
should
know
in
case
anything
happens
to
me
answered
zorzi
it
is
buried
in
that
big
jar
in
some
three
feet
of
broken
glass
i
had
to
take
the
glass
out
bit
by
bit
and
put
it
all
back
again
as
marietta
looked
at
the
jar
a
little
colour
rose
in
her
face
again
thank
you
she
said
i
know
you
trust
me
now
i
always
have
he
answered
softly
and
i
always
shall
even
when
you
are
married
to
jacopo
contarini
that
is
still
far
off
let
us
not
talk
of
it
you
must
get
ready
to
leave
this
place
before
morning
you
must
take
the
skiff
and
get
away
to
the
mainland
if
you
can
for
till
my
father
comes
you
will
not
be
safe
in
venice
i
shall
not
go
away
said
zorzi
firmly
they
may
not
try
to
arrest
me
after
all
but
they
will
i
know
they
will
all
her
anxiety
for
him
came
back
in
a
moment
you
must
go
at
once
zorzi
to
please
me
for
my
sake
leave
for
your
sake
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
do
for
your
sake
except
be
a
coward
but
it
is
not
cowardly
pleaded
marietta
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
done
and
if
my
father
could
know
what
you
risk
by
staying
he
would
tell
you
to
go
as
i
do
please
please
please
i
can
not
he
answered
stubbornly
oh
zorzi
if
you
have
the
least
friendship
for
me
do
what
i
ask
do
you
not
see
that
i
am
half
mad
with
anxiety
i
entreat
you
i
beg
you
i
implore
you
their
eyes
met
and
hers
were
wide
with
fear
for
him
and
earnestness
and
they
were
not
quite
dry
do
you
care
so
much
asked
zorzi
hardly
knowing
what
he
said
does
it
matter
so
much
to
you
what
becomes
of
me
he
moved
nearer
on
the
bench
leaning
towards
her
where
he
sat
he
could
rest
his
elbow
on
the
broad
arm
of
the
low
chair
and
so
look
into
her
face
she
covered
her
eyes
and
shook
a
little
and
her
mantle
slipped
from
her
shoulders
and
trembled
as
it
settled
down
into
the
chair
he
leaned
farther
till
he
was
close
to
her
and
he
tried
to
uncover
her
eyes
very
gently
but
she
resisted
his
heart
beat
slowly
and
hard
like
strokes
of
a
hammer
and
his
hands
were
shaking
when
he
drew
her
nearer
presently
he
himself
sat
upon
the
arm
of
the
chair
holding
her
close
to
him
and
she
let
him
press
her
head
to
his
breast
for
she
could
not
think
any
more
and
all
at
once
her
hands
slipped
down
and
she
was
resting
in
the
hollow
of
his
arm
looking
up
to
his
face
it
seemed
a
long
time
as
long
as
whole
years
since
she
had
meant
to
drop
another
rose
in
his
path
or
even
since
she
had
suffered
him
to
press
her
hand
for
a
moment
the
whole
tale
was
told
now
in
one
touch
in
one
look
with
little
resistance
and
less
fear
i
love
you
he
said
slowly
and
earnestly
and
the
words
were
strange
to
his
own
ears
for
he
had
never
said
them
before
nor
had
she
ever
heard
them
and
when
they
are
spoken
in
that
way
they
are
the
most
wonderful
words
in
the
world
both
to
speak
and
to
hear
the
look
he
had
so
rarely
seen
was
there
now
and
there
was
no
care
to
hide
what
was
in
her
eyes
for
she
had
told
him
all
without
a
word
as
women
can
i
have
loved
you
very
long
he
said
again
and
with
one
hand
he
pressed
back
her
hair
and
smoothed
it
i
know
it
she
answered
gazing
at
him
with
lips
just
parted
but
i
have
loved
you
longer
still
how
could
i
guess
it
he
asked
it
seems
so
wonderful
so
very
strange
i
could
not
say
it
first
she
smiled
and
yet
i
tried
to
tell
you
without
words
did
you
she
nodded
as
her
head
lay
in
his
arm
and
closed
her
smiling
lips
tightly
and
nodded
again
you
would
not
understand
she
said
you
always
made
it
hard
for
me
oh
if
i
had
only
known
she
lay
quietly
on
his
arm
for
a
few
seconds
and
neither
spoke
only
the
low
roar
of
the
furnace
was
heard
in
the
hot
stillness
marietta
looked
up
steadily
into
his
face
with
unwinking
eyes
how
you
look
at
me
he
said
with
a
happy
smile
i
have
often
wanted
to
look
at
you
like
this
she
answered
gravely
but
until
you
had
told
me
how
could
i
he
bent
down
rather
timidly
but
drawn
to
her
by
a
power
he
could
not
resist
his
first
kiss
touched
her
forehead
lightly
with
a
sort
of
boyish
reverence
while
a
thrill
ran
through
every
nerve
and
fibre
of
his
body
but
she
turned
in
his
arms
and
threw
her
own
suddenly
round
his
neck
and
in
an
instant
their
lips
met
zorzi
was
in
a
dream
where
marietta
alone
was
real
all
thought
and
recollection
of
danger
vanished
the
very
room
was
not
the
laboratory
where
he
had
so
long
lived
and
worked
and
thought
and
suffered
the
walls
were
gold
the
stone
pavement
was
a
silken
carpet
the
shadowy
beams
were
the
carved
ceiling
of
a
palace
he
was
himself
the
king
and
master
of
the
whole
world
and
he
held
all
his
kingdom
in
his
arms
you
understand
now
marietta
said
at
last
holding
his
face
before
her
with
her
hands
no
he
answered
lovingly
i
do
not
understand
i
will
not
even
try
if
i
do
i
shall
open
my
eyes
and
it
will
suddenly
be
daylight
and
i
shall
put
out
my
hands
and
find
nothing
i
shall
be
alone
in
my
room
just
awake
and
aching
with
a
horrible
longing
for
the
impossible
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
dream
of
you
and
wake
in
the
grey
dawn
you
can
not
guess
what
the
emptiness
is
the
loneliness
i
know
it
well
said
marietta
i
have
been
perfectly
happy
talking
to
you
under
the
your
hand
in
mine
and
mine
in
yours
our
eyes
in
each
other
eyes
our
hearts
one
heart
and
then
all
at
once
there
was
nella
standing
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
with
a
big
dish
in
her
hands
laughing
at
me
because
i
had
been
sleeping
so
soundly
oh
sometimes
i
could
kill
her
for
waking
me
she
drew
his
face
to
hers
with
a
little
laugh
that
broke
off
short
for
a
kiss
is
a
grave
matter
how
much
time
we
have
wasted
in
all
these
months
she
said
presently
why
would
you
never
understand
how
could
i
guess
that
you
could
ever
love
me
zorzi
asked
i
guessed
that
you
loved
me
objected
marietta
at
least
she
added
correcting
herself
i
was
quite
sure
of
it
for
a
little
while
then
i
did
not
believe
it
all
if
i
had
believed
it
quite
they
should
never
have
betrothed
me
to
jacopo
contarini
the
name
recalled
all
realities
to
zorzi
though
she
spoke
it
very
carelessly
almost
with
scorn
zorzi
sighed
and
looked
up
at
last
and
stared
at
the
wall
opposite
what
is
it
asked
marietta
quickly
why
do
you
sigh
there
is
reason
enough
are
you
not
betrothed
to
him
as
you
say
marietta
straightened
herself
suddenly
and
made
him
look
at
her
a
quick
light
was
in
her
eyes
as
she
spoke
do
you
know
what
you
are
saying
do
you
think
that
if
i
meant
to
marry
messer
jacopo
i
should
be
here
now
that
i
should
let
you
hold
me
in
your
arms
that
i
would
kiss
you
do
you
really
believe
that
i
could
not
believe
it
zorzi
answered
and
yet
and
yet
you
almost
do
she
cried
what
more
do
you
need
to
know
that
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
and
will
and
that
i
mean
to
be
your
wife
come
what
may
how
is
it
possible
asked
zorzi
almost
disconsolately
how
could
you
ever
marry
me
what
am
i
after
all
compared
with
you
i
am
not
even
a
venetian
i
am
a
stranger
a
waif
a
man
with
neither
name
nor
fortune
and
i
am
half
a
cripple
lame
for
life
how
can
you
marry
me
at
the
first
word
of
such
a
thing
your
father
will
join
his
son
against
me
i
shall
be
thrown
into
prison
on
some
false
charge
and
shall
never
come
out
again
unless
it
be
to
be
hanged
for
some
crime
i
never
committed
there
is
a
very
simple
way
of
preventing
all
those
dreadful
things
answered
marietta
i
wish
i
could
find
it
take
me
with
you
she
said
calmly
zorzi
looked
at
her
in
dumb
surprise
for
she
could
not
have
said
anything
which
he
had
expected
less
listen
to
me
she
continued
you
can
not
stay
here
or
rather
you
shall
not
for
i
will
not
let
you
no
you
need
not
smile
and
shake
your
head
for
i
will
find
some
means
of
making
you
go
you
will
find
that
hard
dear
love
for
that
is
the
only
thing
i
will
not
do
for
you
is
it
we
shall
see
you
are
very
brave
and
you
are
very
very
obstinate
but
you
are
not
very
sensible
for
you
are
only
a
man
after
all
in
the
first
place
do
you
imagine
that
even
if
giovanni
were
to
spend
a
whole
week
in
this
room
he
would
think
of
looking
for
the
box
amongst
the
broken
glass
no
i
do
not
think
he
would
answered
zorzi
that
was
sensible
of
me
at
all
events
she
laughed
oh
you
are
clever
enough
i
never
said
that
you
were
not
that
i
only
said
that
you
had
no
sense
as
for
instance
since
you
are
sure
that
my
brother
can
not
find
the
box
why
do
you
wish
to
stay
here
i
promised
your
father
that
i
would
i
will
keep
my
promise
at
all
costs
in
which
of
two
ways
shall
you
be
of
more
use
to
my
father
if
you
hide
in
a
safe
place
till
he
comes
home
and
if
you
then
come
back
to
him
and
help
him
as
before
or
if
you
allow
yourself
to
be
thrown
into
prison
and
tried
and
perhaps
hanged
or
banished
for
something
you
never
did
and
if
any
harm
comes
to
you
what
do
you
think
would
become
of
me
do
you
see
i
told
you
that
you
had
no
common
sense
now
you
will
believe
me
but
if
all
this
is
not
enough
to
make
you
go
i
have
another
plan
which
you
can
not
possibly
oppose
what
is
that
asked
zorzi
i
will
go
alone
i
will
cross
the
bridge
and
take
the
skiff
and
row
myself
over
to
venice
and
from
venice
i
will
get
to
the
mainland
you
could
not
row
the
skiff
objected
zorzi
amused
at
the
idea
you
would
fall
off
or
upset
her
then
i
should
drown
returned
marietta
philosophically
and
you
would
be
sorry
whether
you
thought
it
was
your
fault
or
not
is
that
true
yes
very
well
if
you
will
not
promise
me
faithfully
to
escape
to
the
mainland
i
swear
to
you
by
all
that
you
and
i
believe
in
and
most
of
all
by
our
love
for
each
other
that
i
will
do
what
i
said
and
run
away
from
my
father
house
but
you
will
not
let
me
go
alone
will
you
no
there
you
see
of
course
you
would
not
let
me
go
alone
me
a
poor
weak
girl
who
have
never
taken
a
step
alone
in
my
life
until
and
they
say
that
the
world
is
so
wicked
what
would
become
of
me
if
you
let
me
go
away
alone
if
i
thought
you
meant
to
do
that
he
laughed
again
and
drew
her
to
him
and
would
have
kissed
her
but
she
held
him
back
and
looked
at
him
earnestly
i
mean
it
she
said
that
is
what
i
will
do
i
swear
that
i
will
yes
now
you
may
and
she
kissed
him
of
her
own
accord
but
quickly
withdrew
herself
from
his
arms
again
you
have
your
choice
she
said
and
you
must
choose
quickly
for
i
have
been
here
too
long
it
must
be
nearly
half
an
hour
since
i
left
my
room
and
nella
is
waiting
for
me
thinking
that
i
am
with
my
brother
and
his
wife
promise
me
to
do
what
i
ask
and
i
will
go
back
and
when
my
father
comes
home
i
will
tell
him
the
whole
troth
that
is
the
wisest
thing
after
all
or
i
will
go
with
you
if
you
will
take
me
as
i
am
no
he
answered
with
an
effort
i
will
not
take
you
with
me
it
cost
him
a
hard
struggle
to
refuse
there
she
was
resting
against
his
arm
in
the
blush
and
wealth
of
unspent
love
asking
to
go
with
him
who
loved
her
better
than
his
life
but
in
a
quick
vision
he
saw
her
with
him
she
who
was
delicately
nurtured
and
used
from
childhood
to
all
that
care
and
money
could
give
he
saw
her
with
him
sharing
his
misery
his
hunger
and
his
wandering
suffering
silently
for
love
sake
but
suffering
much
and
he
could
not
bear
the
fancied
sight
i
should
be
in
your
way
she
said
besides
they
would
send
all
over
italy
to
find
me
it
is
not
that
he
answered
you
might
starve
she
looked
up
anxiously
to
his
face
and
you
she
asked
have
you
no
money
no
how
should
i
have
money
i
believe
i
have
one
piece
of
gold
and
a
little
silver
it
will
be
enough
to
keep
me
from
starvation
till
i
can
get
work
somewhere
i
can
live
on
bread
and
water
as
i
have
many
a
time
if
i
had
only
thought
exclaimed
marietta
i
have
so
much
my
father
left
me
a
little
purse
of
gold
that
i
shall
never
need
i
would
not
take
your
father
money
answered
zorzi
but
have
no
fear
if
i
go
at
all
i
shall
do
well
enough
besides
there
is
a
man
in
venice
he
stopped
short
not
wishing
to
speak
of
zuan
venier
you
must
not
make
any
condition
she
answered
not
heeding
the
unfinished
sentence
you
must
go
at
once
she
rose
as
she
spoke
every
minute
i
stay
here
makes
it
more
dangerous
for
me
to
go
back
she
said
i
know
that
you
will
keep
your
promise
we
must
say
he
had
risen
too
and
stood
facing
her
his
crutch
under
his
arm
in
all
her
anxiety
for
his
safety
she
had
half
forgotten
that
his
wound
was
barely
healed
and
that
he
still
walked
with
great
difficulty
and
now
at
the
thought
of
leaving
him
she
forgot
everything
else
they
had
been
so
cruelly
short
those
few
minutes
of
perfect
happiness
between
the
long
misunderstanding
that
had
kept
them
apart
and
the
parting
again
that
was
to
separate
them
perhaps
for
months
as
they
looked
at
each
other
they
both
grew
pale
and
in
an
instant
zorzi
young
face
looked
haggard
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
grow
hollow
while
marietta
filled
with
tears
she
cried
in
a
broken
voice
god
keep
you
my
dear
love
then
her
face
was
buried
in
the
hollow
of
his
shoulder
and
her
tears
flowed
fast
and
burning
hot
chapter
xvii
it
was
over
at
last
and
zorzi
stood
alone
by
the
table
for
marietta
would
not
let
him
go
with
her
to
the
door
she
could
not
trust
herself
before
pasquale
even
in
the
gloom
he
stood
by
the
table
leaning
on
it
heavily
with
one
hand
and
trying
to
realise
all
that
had
come
into
his
lonely
life
within
the
half
hour
and
all
that
might
happen
to
him
before
morning
the
glorious
and
triumphant
certainty
which
first
love
brings
to
every
man
when
it
is
first
returned
still
swelled
his
heart
and
filled
the
air
he
breathed
so
that
while
breathing
deep
he
could
not
breathe
enough
in
such
a
mood
all
dangers
dwindled
all
obstacles
sank
out
of
sight
as
shadows
sink
at
dawn
and
yet
the
parting
had
hurt
him
as
if
his
body
had
been
wrenched
in
the
middle
by
some
resistless
force
women
feel
parting
differently
shall
we
men
ever
understand
them
to
a
man
first
love
is
a
victory
to
a
girl
it
is
a
sweet
wonder
and
a
joy
and
a
tender
longing
all
in
one
and
when
partings
come
as
come
they
must
in
life
until
death
brings
the
last
it
is
always
the
man
who
leaves
and
the
woman
who
is
left
even
though
in
plain
fact
it
be
the
man
that
stays
behind
and
we
men
feel
a
little
contemptuous
pity
for
one
who
seems
to
cry
out
after
the
woman
he
loves
asking
why
she
has
left
him
and
beseeching
her
to
come
back
to
him
but
our
compassion
for
the
woman
in
like
case
is
always
sincere
in
such
small
things
there
are
the
great
mysteries
of
that
prime
difference
which
neither
man
nor
woman
can
ever
fully
understand
but
which
if
not
understood
a
little
is
the
cause
of
much
miserable
misunderstanding
in
life
zorzi
had
to
face
the
future
at
once
for
it
was
upon
him
and
the
old
life
was
over
perhaps
never
to
come
again
he
stood
still
where
he
was
for
any
useless
movement
was
an
effort
and
he
tried
to
collect
his
thoughts
and
determine
just
what
he
should
do
and
how
it
was
to
be
done
his
eye
fell
on
the
piece
of
gold
giovanni
had
paid
for
the
beaker
in
the
morning
if
he
drew
the
iron
tray
further
down
the
annealing
oven
the
glass
would
be
ready
to
be
taken
out
and
giovanni
could
take
it
if
he
pleased
for
he
knew
whose
it
was
but
starvation
itself
could
not
have
induced
zorzi
to
take
the
money
now
he
turned
from
it
with
contempt
all
he
needed
was
enough
to
buy
bread
for
a
week
and
mere
bread
cost
little
that
little
he
had
and
it
must
suffice
besides
that
he
would
make
a
bundle
small
enough
to
be
easily
carried
his
chief
difficulty
would
be
in
rowing
the
skiff
to
use
the
single
oar
at
all
it
was
almost
indispensable
to
stand
and
to
stand
chiefly
on
the
right
foot
since
the
single
rowlock
as
in
every
venetian
boat
was
on
the
starboard
side
and
could
not
be
shifted
to
port
he
fancied
that
in
some
way
he
could
manage
to
sit
on
the
thwart
and
use
the
oar
as
a
paddle
in
any
case
he
must
get
away
since
flight
was
the
wisest
course
and
since
he
had
promised
marietta
that
he
would
go
his
reflections
had
occupied
scarce
half
a
minute
he
began
to
walk
towards
the
small
room
where
he
slept
and
where
he
kept
his
few
possessions
he
had
taken
two
steps
from
the
table
when
he
stopped
short
turned
round
and
listened
he
heard
the
sound
of
light
footsteps
running
along
the
path
and
coming
nearer
in
another
moment
marietta
was
at
the
window
her
face
deadly
white
her
eyes
wide
with
fear
they
are
there
she
cried
wildly
they
have
come
hide
yourself
quickly
pasquale
will
keep
them
out
as
long
as
he
can
she
had
found
pasquale
stoutly
refusing
to
open
the
door
outside
stood
a
lieutenant
of
the
archers
with
men
demanding
admittance
in
the
name
of
the
governor
pasquale
answered
that
they
might
get
in
by
force
if
they
could
but
that
he
had
no
orders
to
open
the
door
to
them
the
lieutenant
was
in
doubt
whether
his
warrant
authorised
him
to
break
in
or
not
zorzi
knew
that
marietta
was
in
even
more
danger
than
he
the
situation
was
desperate
and
the
time
short
she
was
still
at
the
window
looking
in
you
know
your
way
to
the
main
furnace
rooms
zorzi
said
quickly
but
with
great
coolness
run
in
there
and
stand
still
in
the
dark
till
everything
is
quiet
then
slip
out
and
get
home
as
quickly
as
possible
but
you
what
will
become
of
you
asked
marietta
in
an
agony
of
anxiety
if
they
do
not
take
me
at
once
they
will
search
all
the
buildings
and
will
find
you
answered
zorzi
i
will
go
and
meet
them
while
you
are
hiding
he
opened
the
door
beside
the
window
and
put
his
crutch
forward
upon
the
path
at
the
same
moment
the
sound
of
a
tremendous
blow
echoed
down
the
dark
corridor
the
moon
was
low
but
had
not
set
and
there
was
still
light
in
the
garden
quickly
zorzi
exclaimed
they
are
breaking
down
the
door
but
marietta
clung
to
him
almost
savagely
when
he
tried
to
push
her
in
the
direction
of
the
main
furnace
rooms
on
the
other
side
of
the
garden
i
will
not
leave
you
she
cried
they
shall
take
me
with
you
wherever
you
are
going
she
grasped
his
hand
with
both
her
hands
and
then
as
he
moved
she
slipped
her
arm
round
him
at
the
street
door
the
pounding
blows
succeeded
each
other
in
quick
succession
but
apparently
without
effect
zorzi
saw
that
he
must
make
her
understand
her
extreme
danger
he
took
hold
of
her
wrist
with
a
quiet
strength
that
recalled
her
to
herself
and
there
was
a
tone
of
command
in
his
voice
when
he
spoke
go
at
once
he
said
it
will
be
worse
for
both
of
us
if
you
are
found
here
they
will
hang
me
for
stealing
the
master
daughter
as
well
as
his
secrets
go
dear
love
go
he
kissed
her
once
and
then
gently
pushed
her
from
him
she
understood
that
she
must
obey
and
that
if
he
spoke
of
his
own
danger
it
was
for
the
sake
of
her
good
name
with
a
gesture
of
despair
she
turned
and
left
him
crossed
the
patch
of
light
without
looking
back
and
disappeared
into
the
shadows
beyond
she
was
safe
now
for
he
would
go
and
meet
the
archers
opening
the
door
to
give
himself
up
using
his
crutch
he
swung
himself
along
into
the
dark
corridor
without
another
hesitation
but
matters
did
not
turn
out
as
he
expected
when
the
force
came
down
the
footway
from
the
dilution
of
san
piero
giovanni
was
still
talking
to
his
wife
about
household
economies
and
censuring
what
he
called
the
reckless
extravagance
of
his
father
housekeeping
as
he
talked
he
heard
the
even
tread
of
a
number
of
marching
men
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
went
to
the
window
for
he
guessed
who
was
coming
though
he
could
not
imagine
why
the
governor
had
not
waited
till
the
next
day
as
had
been
agreed
he
could
not
know
that
on
leaving
him
jacopo
contarini
had
seen
his
father
and
had
told
him
of
zorzi
misdeeds
and
that
the
governor
had
supped
with
old
contarini
who
was
an
uncompromising
champion
of
the
law
besides
being
one
of
the
ten
and
therefore
the
governor
superior
in
office
and
that
contarini
had
advised
that
zorzi
should
be
taken
on
that
same
night
as
he
might
be
warned
of
his
danger
and
find
means
to
escape
moreover
contarini
offered
a
trusty
and
swift
oarsman
to
take
the
order
to
murano
and
the
governor
wrote
it
on
the
supper
table
between
two
draughts
of
greek
wine
which
he
drank
from
a
goblet
made
by
angelo
beroviero
himself
in
the
days
when
he
still
worked
at
the
art
in
half
an
hour
the
warrant
was
in
the
hands
of
the
officer
who
immediately
called
out
of
his
men
and
marched
them
down
to
the
giovanni
saw
them
stop
and
knock
at
the
door
and
he
heard
gruff
inquiry
in
the
governor
name
open
at
once
said
the
officer
any
one
can
say
that
answered
the
porter
in
the
devil
name
go
home
and
go
to
bed
is
this
carnival
time
to
go
masquerading
by
the
light
of
the
moon
and
waking
up
honest
people
silence
roared
the
lieutenant
open
the
door
or
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
if
the
signor
giovanni
hears
this
disturbance
answered
pasquale
who
could
see
giovanni
at
the
window
opposite
in
the
moonlight
either
get
orders
from
him
or
go
home
and
leave
me
in
holy
peace
you
band
of
braying
jackasses
you
mob
of
barbary
apes
you
pack
of
doltish
droiling
doddered
joltheads
be
off
this
eloquence
combined
with
pasquale
assured
manner
caused
the
lieutenant
to
hesitate
before
breaking
down
the
door
an
operation
for
which
he
had
not
been
prepared
and
for
which
he
had
brought
no
engines
of
battery
can
you
get
in
he
inquired
of
his
men
without
deigning
to
answer
the
porter
invectives
if
not
let
one
of
you
go
for
a
sledge
hammer
try
it
with
the
butts
of
your
halberds
against
the
lock
one
two
three
and
all
at
once
oh
break
down
the
door
cried
pasquale
derisively
it
is
of
oak
and
iron
and
it
cost
good
money
and
you
shall
pay
for
it
you
lubberly
ours
but
the
men
pounded
away
with
a
good
will
open
the
door
cried
giovanni
from
the
opposite
window
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
the
sight
of
the
destruction
of
property
for
which
he
might
have
to
account
to
his
father
was
very
painful
to
him
but
he
could
not
make
himself
heard
in
the
terrific
din
or
else
pasquale
suspected
the
truth
and
pretended
that
he
could
not
hear
the
porter
had
seen
marietta
a
moment
in
the
gloom
and
he
knew
that
she
had
gone
back
to
warn
zorzi
he
hoped
to
give
them
both
time
to
hide
themselves
and
he
now
retired
from
the
grating
and
began
to
strengthen
the
door
first
by
putting
two
more
heavy
oak
bars
in
their
places
across
it
near
the
top
and
bottom
and
further
by
bringing
the
scanty
furniture
from
his
lodge
and
piling
it
up
against
the
panels
meanwhile
the
pounding
continued
at
a
great
rate
and
giovanni
thought
it
better
to
go
down
and
interfere
in
person
since
he
could
not
make
himself
heard
the
servants
were
all
roused
by
this
time
and
many
heads
were
looking
out
of
upper
windows
not
only
from
beroviero
house
but
from
the
houses
higher
up
beyond
the
wooden
bridge
two
men
who
were
walking
up
the
footway
from
the
opposite
direction
stopped
at
a
little
distance
and
looked
on
their
hoods
drawn
over
their
eyes
giovanni
came
out
hurriedly
and
crossed
the
bridge
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
lieutenant
shoulder
anxiously
and
spoke
close
to
his
ear
for
the
pounding
was
deafening
the
six
men
had
strapped
their
halberds
firmly
together
in
a
solid
bundle
with
their
belts
and
standing
three
on
each
side
they
swung
the
whole
mass
of
wood
and
iron
like
a
battering
ram
in
regular
time
stop
them
sir
stop
them
pray
cried
giovanni
i
will
have
the
door
opened
for
you
suddenly
there
was
silence
as
the
officer
caught
one
of
his
men
by
the
arm
and
bade
them
all
wait
who
are
you
sir
he
inquired
i
am
giovanni
beroviero
answered
giovanni
sure
that
his
name
would
inspire
respect
the
officer
took
off
his
cap
politely
and
then
replaced
it
the
two
men
who
were
looking
on
nudged
each
other
i
have
a
warrant
to
arrest
a
certain
zorzi
began
the
lieutenant
i
know
it
is
quite
right
and
he
is
within
answered
giovanni
pasquale
he
called
standing
on
tiptoe
under
the
grating
pasquale
open
the
door
at
once
for
these
gentlemen
gentlemen
echoed
one
of
the
men
softly
with
a
low
laugh
and
digging
his
elbow
into
his
companion
side
no
one
else
spoke
for
a
moment
then
pasquale
looked
through
the
grating
what
did
you
say
he
asked
i
said
open
the
door
at
once
answered
giovanni
can
you
not
recognise
the
officers
of
the
law
when
you
see
them
no
grunted
pasquale
i
have
never
seen
much
of
them
did
you
say
i
was
to
open
the
door
yes
cried
giovanni
angrily
for
he
wished
to
show
his
zeal
before
the
officer
blockhead
he
added
with
emphasis
as
pasquale
disappeared
again
and
was
presumably
out
of
hearing
they
all
heard
him
dragging
the
furniture
away
again
the
and
the
table
and
the
old
chair
zorzi
came
up
as
pasquale
was
clearing
the
stuff
away
they
want
you
said
the
old
sailor
seeing
him
and
hearing
him
at
the
same
time
what
have
you
been
doing
now
where
is
the
young
lady
in
the
main
furnace
room
whispered
zorzi
do
not
let
them
go
there
whatever
they
do
pasquale
gave
vent
to
his
feelings
in
a
low
voice
as
he
dragged
the
last
things
back
and
began
to
unbar
the
door
zorzi
leaned
against
the
wall
for
his
lameness
prevented
him
from
helping
at
last
the
door
was
opened
and
he
saw
the
figures
of
the
men
outside
against
the
light
he
went
forward
as
quickly
as
he
could
pushing
past
pasquale
to
get
out
he
stood
on
the
threshold
leaning
on
his
crutch
i
am
zorzi
he
said
quietly
zorzi
the
dalmatian
called
the
ballarin
asked
the
lieutenant
yes
yes
cried
giovanni
anxious
to
hasten
matters
they
call
him
the
dancer
because
he
is
lame
this
is
that
foreign
liar
that
thief
that
assassin
take
him
quickly
the
archers
who
in
the
changes
of
time
had
become
halberdiers
had
dropped
the
bundle
of
spears
they
had
made
for
a
two
of
them
took
zorzi
by
the
arms
roughly
and
prepared
to
drag
him
along
with
them
he
made
no
resistance
but
objected
quietly
i
can
walk
better
if
you
do
not
hold
me
he
said
i
can
not
run
away
as
you
see
let
him
walk
between
you
ordered
the
officer
good
night
sir
he
said
to
giovanni
two
of
the
men
lifted
the
bundle
of
halberds
and
began
to
carry
it
between
them
trying
to
undo
the
straps
as
they
walked
for
they
could
not
stay
behind
giovanni
saluted
the
officer
and
stood
aside
for
the
party
to
pass
the
two
men
who
had
looked
on
had
separated
and
one
had
already
gone
forward
and
disappeared
beyond
the
bridge
the
other
lingered
apparently
still
interested
in
the
proceedings
pasquale
dumb
with
rage
at
last
stood
in
the
doorway
let
me
pass
said
giovanni
as
soon
as
the
archers
had
gone
on
a
few
steps
surrounding
zorzi
with
a
growl
pasquale
came
out
and
stood
on
the
pavement
a
moment
and
giovanni
went
in
instantly
the
man
who
had
lingered
made
a
step
towards
the
porter
whispered
something
in
his
ear
and
then
made
off
as
fast
as
he
could
in
the
direction
taken
by
the
archers
pasquale
looked
after
him
in
surprise
only
half
understanding
the
meaning
of
what
he
had
said
then
he
went
in
but
left
the
door
ajar
the
people
who
had
been
looking
out
of
the
windows
of
beroviero
house
had
disappeared
when
they
had
seen
that
giovanni
was
on
the
footway
all
was
silent
now
only
far
off
the
tramp
of
the
archers
could
still
be
heard
they
could
not
go
very
fast
with
zorzi
in
their
midst
but
the
two
men
who
were
busy
unfastening
the
bundle
of
halberds
lagged
in
the
rear
talking
in
a
low
voice
they
did
not
notice
quick
footsteps
behind
them
but
they
heard
a
low
whistle
answered
instantly
by
another
just
as
the
main
party
was
nearing
the
corner
by
the
church
of
san
piero
that
was
the
last
the
two
loiterers
remembered
for
at
the
next
instant
they
lay
in
a
heap
upon
the
halberds
which
had
fallen
upon
the
pavement
with
a
tremendous
clatter
a
couple
of
blows
with
a
stout
stick
had
thoroughly
stunned
them
almost
at
the
same
instant
it
would
be
some
time
before
they
recovered
their
senses
while
the
man
who
had
whispered
to
pasquale
was
doing
effectual
work
in
the
rear
his
companion
was
boldly
attacking
the
main
party
in
front
as
the
lieutenant
stopped
short
and
turned
his
head
when
the
halberds
dropped
a
blow
under
the
jaw
from
a
fist
like
a
sledge
hammer
almost
lifted
him
off
his
feet
and
sent
him
reeling
till
he
fell
senseless
paces
away
before
the
two
archers
who
were
guarding
zorzi
could
defend
themselves
unarmed
as
they
were
another
blow
had
felled
one
of
them
the
second
springing
forward
was
caught
up
like
a
child
by
his
terrible
assailant
and
whirled
through
the
air
to
fall
with
a
noisy
splash
into
the
shallow
waters
of
the
canal
the
other
companion
attacked
the
remaining
two
from
behind
with
his
club
and
knocked
one
of
them
down
the
last
sprang
to
one
side
and
ran
on
a
few
steps
as
fast
as
he
could
but
swifter
feet
followed
him
and
in
an
instant
iron
fingers
were
clutching
his
throat
and
squeezing
his
breath
out
he
struggled
a
moment
and
then
sank
down
his
captor
deliberately
knocked
him
on
the
head
with
his
fist
and
he
rolled
over
like
a
stone
utterly
bewildered
zorzi
stood
still
where
he
had
stopped
never
in
his
life
had
he
dreamed
that
two
men
could
dispose
of
seven
in
something
like
half
a
minute
with
nothing
but
a
stick
for
a
weapon
between
them
but
he
had
seen
it
with
his
eyes
and
he
was
not
surprised
when
he
felt
himself
lifted
from
his
feet
with
his
crutch
beside
him
and
carried
along
the
footway
at
a
sharp
run
in
the
direction
of
the
his
reason
told
him
that
he
had
been
rescued
and
was
being
quickly
conveyed
to
a
place
of
safety
but
he
could
not
help
distrusting
the
means
that
accomplished
the
end
for
he
had
unconsciously
watched
the
two
men
in
what
could
hardly
be
called
a
fight
though
he
could
not
see
their
faces
and
a
more
murderous
pair
of
ruffians
he
had
never
seen
men
not
well
used
to
such
deeds
could
not
have
done
them
at
all
thought
zorzi
as
he
was
borne
along
his
breath
almost
shaken
out
of
him
by
the
strong
man
movements
all
was
quiet
as
they
passed
the
and
no
one
was
looking
out
for
giovanni
wife
feared
him
far
too
much
to
seem
to
be
spying
upon
his
doings
and
the
servants
were
discreet
only
nella
hiding
behind
the
flowers
in
marietta
window
and
supposing
that
marietta
was
with
her
was
watching
the
door
of
the
to
see
when
giovanni
would
come
out
she
now
heard
the
steps
of
the
two
men
running
down
the
footway
the
rescue
had
taken
place
too
far
away
for
her
to
hear
anything
but
a
splash
in
the
canal
she
saw
that
one
of
the
men
was
carrying
what
seemed
to
be
the
body
of
a
man
she
instinctively
crossed
herself
as
they
ran
on
towards
the
end
of
the
canal
and
when
she
could
see
them
no
longer
in
the
shadow
she
drew
back
into
the
room
momentarily
forgetting
giovanni
and
already
running
over
in
her
head
the
wonderful
conversation
she
was
going
to
have
with
her
mistress
as
soon
as
the
young
girl
came
back
to
her
room
pasquale
meanwhile
withdrew
his
feet
from
the
old
leathern
slippers
he
wore
and
noiselessly
stole
down
the
corridor
and
along
the
garden
path
to
find
out
what
giovanni
was
doing
when
he
came
to
the
laboratory
he
saw
that
the
window
was
now
shut
as
well
as
the
door
and
that
giovanni
had
set
the
lamp
on
the
floor
behind
the
further
end
of
the
annealing
oven
its
bright
light
shot
upwards
to
the
dark
ceiling
leaving
the
front
of
the
laboratory
almost
in
the
dark
pasquale
listened
and
he
heard
the
sharp
tapping
of
a
hammer
on
stone
he
understood
at
once
that
giovanni
had
shut
himself
in
to
search
for
something
and
would
therefore
be
busy
some
time
without
noise
he
crossed
the
garden
to
the
entrance
of
the
main
furnace
room
and
went
into
the
passage
come
out
quickly
he
whispered
as
his
seaman
eyes
made
out
marietta
figure
in
a
gloom
that
would
have
been
total
darkness
to
a
landsman
and
he
took
hold
of
the
girl
arm
to
lead
her
away
your
brother
is
in
the
laboratory
and
will
not
come
out
he
whispered
by
this
time
zorzi
may
be
safe
safe
she
spoke
the
word
aloud
in
her
relief
hush
for
heaven
sake
the
door
is
open
you
can
get
home
now
without
being
seen
make
no
noise
she
followed
him
quickly
they
had
to
cross
the
patch
of
dim
light
in
the
garden
and
she
glanced
at
the
closed
window
of
the
laboratory
it
had
all
happened
as
zorzi
had
foreseen
and
giovanni
was
already
searching
for
the
manuscript
the
only
thing
she
could
not
understand
was
that
zorzi
should
have
escaped
the
archers
even
as
she
crossed
the
garden
the
two
man
were
passing
the
door
bearing
zorzi
he
knew
not
where
but
away
from
the
nearest
danger
a
moment
later
she
was
on
the
footway
hurrying
towards
the
bridge
pasquale
stood
watching
her
to
be
sure
that
she
was
safe
and
he
glanced
up
at
the
windows
too
fearing
lest
some
one
might
still
be
looking
out
but
chance
had
saved
marietta
this
time
she
carefully
barred
the
side
door
after
she
had
gone
in
and
groped
her
way
up
the
dark
stairs
on
the
landing
there
was
light
from
below
and
she
paused
for
breath
her
bosom
heaving
as
she
leaned
a
moment
on
the
balustrade
she
passed
one
hand
over
her
brows
as
if
to
bring
herself
back
to
present
consciousness
and
then
went
quickly
on
safe
she
repeated
under
her
breath
as
she
went
safe
safe
safe
it
was
to
give
herself
courage
for
she
could
hardly
believe
it
though
she
knew
that
pasquale
would
not
deceive
her
and
must
have
some
strong
good
reason
for
what
he
said
there
had
not
been
time
to
question
him
all
he
knew
himself
was
that
a
man
whose
face
he
could
not
see
had
whispered
to
him
that
zorzi
was
in
no
danger
but
he
had
recognised
the
other
man
who
had
gone
up
the
footway
first
in
spite
of
his
short
cloak
and
hood
and
he
felt
well
assured
that
charalambos
aristarchi
could
throw
the
officer
and
his
six
men
into
the
canal
without
anybody
help
if
he
chose
though
why
the
greek
ruffian
was
suddenly
inspired
to
interfere
on
zorzi
behalf
was
a
mystery
past
his
comprehension
marietta
entered
her
room
and
nella
who
had
been
revelling
in
the
coming
conversation
was
suddenly
very
busy
stirring
the
drink
of
lime
flowers
which
marietta
had
ordered
she
was
so
sure
that
her
mistress
had
been
all
the
time
in
the
house
and
so
anxious
not
to
have
it
thought
that
she
could
possibly
have
been
idle
even
for
a
moment
that
she
looked
intently
into
the
cup
and
stirred
the
contents
in
a
most
conscientious
manner
marietta
turned
from
her
almost
immediately
and
began
to
undo
the
braids
of
hair
that
nella
might
comb
it
out
and
plait
it
again
for
the
night
nella
immediately
began
to
talk
and
to
tell
all
that
she
had
seen
from
the
window
with
many
other
things
which
she
had
not
seen
but
of
course
you
were
looking
out
too
she
said
presently
they
were
all
at
the
windows
for
some
time
no
marietta
answered
i
was
not
looking
out
well
it
was
and
not
you
see
do
you
think
the
governor
is
stupid
if
he
had
waited
till
we
should
have
told
zorzi
poor
zorzi
i
saw
them
taking
him
away
loaded
with
chains
in
chains
cried
marietta
starting
painfully
i
could
not
see
the
chains
continued
nella
apologetically
but
i
am
sure
they
were
there
it
was
too
dark
to
see
poor
zorzi
poor
zorzi
by
this
time
he
is
in
the
prison
under
the
governor
house
and
he
wishes
that
he
had
never
been
born
a
little
straw
a
little
water
that
is
all
he
has
marietta
moved
in
her
chair
as
if
something
hurt
her
but
she
knew
that
it
would
be
unwise
to
stop
the
woman
talk
besides
nella
was
evidently
sorry
for
zorzi
though
she
thought
his
arrest
very
interesting
she
went
on
for
a
long
time
combing
more
and
more
slowly
after
the
manner
of
talkative
maids
when
they
fear
that
their
work
may
be
finished
before
their
story
but
for
pasquale
reassuring
words
marietta
felt
that
she
must
have
gone
mad
zorzi
was
safe
somewhere
and
he
was
not
in
the
governor
prison
on
the
straw
she
told
herself
so
again
and
again
as
nella
went
on
there
is
one
thing
i
did
not
tell
you
said
the
latter
with
a
sudden
increase
of
vigour
at
the
thought
i
think
you
have
told
me
enough
nella
said
marietta
wearily
i
am
very
tired
you
can
not
go
to
bed
till
i
have
plaited
your
hair
answered
nella
mercilessly
but
at
the
same
time
laying
down
the
comb
just
before
you
came
in
i
was
looking
out
of
the
window
it
was
just
an
accident
for
i
was
very
busy
with
your
things
of
course
well
as
i
was
saying
in
passing
i
happened
to
glance
out
of
the
window
and
i
saw
guess
what
i
saw
my
pretty
lady
marietta
trembled
thinking
that
nella
had
seen
her
and
perhaps
recognised
her
and
was
about
to
bring
her
garrulous
tale
to
a
dramatic
climax
by
telling
her
so
perhaps
you
saw
a
woman
she
suggested
desperately
a
woman
indeed
cried
nella
that
must
be
a
nice
woman
who
would
be
seen
in
the
street
at
such
a
time
of
night
and
the
governor
archers
there
too
woman
i
would
not
look
at
such
a
woman
i
tell
you
no
what
i
saw
was
this
since
you
can
not
guess
there
came
two
big
men
running
fast
and
they
were
carrying
a
dead
body
between
them
eh
they
were
at
no
good
i
tell
you
one
could
see
that
marietta
could
bear
no
more
now
she
bent
her
head
and
bit
her
finger
to
keep
herself
from
crying
out
if
you
will
not
be
still
how
in
the
world
am
i
to
plait
your
hair
asked
nella
querulously
do
it
quickly
please
marietta
succeeded
in
saying
i
am
so
very
tired
her
head
bent
still
further
forward
indeed
said
nella
much
annoyed
that
her
tale
should
not
have
been
received
with
more
interest
you
seem
to
be
half
asleep
already
but
nella
was
much
too
truly
attached
to
her
mistress
not
to
feel
some
anxiety
when
she
saw
her
white
face
and
noticed
how
uncertainly
she
walked
nella
had
her
in
bed
at
last
however
and
gave
her
more
of
the
soothing
drink
smoothed
the
cool
pillow
under
her
head
looked
round
the
room
to
see
that
all
was
in
order
before
going
away
then
took
the
lamp
and
at
last
went
out
good
night
my
pretty
lady
said
nella
cheerfully
from
the
door
good
rest
and
pleasant
dreams
she
was
gone
at
last
and
she
would
not
come
back
before
morning
marietta
sat
up
in
bed
in
the
dark
and
pressed
her
hands
to
her
temples
in
utter
despair
i
shall
go
mad
i
shall
go
mad
she
whispered
to
herself
she
remembered
that
she
had
left
her
light
silk
mantle
in
the
laboratory
on
the
great
chair
chapter
xviii
aristarchi
interference
to
rescue
zorzi
had
not
been
disinterested
and
so
far
as
justice
was
concerned
he
was
quite
ready
to
believe
that
the
dalmatian
had
done
all
the
things
of
which
he
was
accused
the
fact
was
not
of
the
slightest
importance
in
the
situation
it
was
much
more
to
the
point
that
in
the
complicated
and
dangerous
plan
which
the
greek
captain
and
arisa
were
carrying
out
zorzi
could
be
of
use
to
them
without
his
own
knowledge
as
has
been
told
the
two
had
decided
that
he
was
in
love
with
marietta
and
she
with
him
the
rest
followed
naturally
after
meeting
his
father
and
telling
him
giovanni
story
jacopo
contarini
had
gone
to
the
house
of
the
agnus
dei
for
an
hour
and
during
that
time
he
had
told
arisa
everything
according
to
his
wont
no
sooner
was
he
gone
than
arisa
made
the
accustomed
signal
and
aristarchi
appeared
at
her
window
for
it
was
then
already
night
he
judged
rightly
that
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
and
having
stopped
at
his
house
to
take
his
trusted
man
the
two
rowed
themselves
over
to
murano
and
were
watching
the
from
a
distance
fully
half
an
hour
before
the
archers
appeared
the
officer
and
his
men
came
to
their
senses
one
by
one
bruised
and
terrified
the
man
who
had
been
thrown
into
the
shallow
canal
got
upon
his
feet
standing
up
to
his
waist
in
the
water
sputtering
and
coughing
from
the
ducking
before
he
tried
to
gain
the
shore
he
crossed
himself
three
times
and
repeated
all
the
prayers
he
could
remember
in
a
great
hurry
for
he
was
of
opinion
that
satan
must
still
be
in
the
neighbourhood
it
was
not
possible
that
any
earthly
being
should
have
picked
him
up
like
a
puppy
and
flung
him
fully
ten
feet
from
the
spot
where
he
had
been
standing
he
struggled
to
the
bank
his
feet
sinking
at
each
step
in
the
slimy
bottom
and
after
that
he
was
forced
to
wade
some
thirty
yards
to
the
stairs
in
front
of
san
piero
before
he
could
get
out
of
the
water
a
miserable
object
drenched
from
head
to
foot
and
coated
with
black
mud
from
his
knees
down
yet
he
was
in
a
better
case
than
his
companions
they
came
to
themselves
slowly
the
officer
last
of
all
for
aristarchi
blow
under
the
jaw
had
nearly
killed
him
whereas
the
other
five
men
had
only
received
stunning
blows
on
different
parts
of
their
thick
skulls
in
half
an
hour
they
were
all
on
their
feet
though
some
of
them
were
very
unsteady
and
in
a
forlorn
train
they
made
the
best
of
their
way
back
to
the
governor
palace
their
discomfiture
had
been
so
sudden
and
complete
that
none
of
them
had
any
idea
as
to
the
number
of
their
assailants
but
most
of
them
agreed
that
as
they
came
within
sight
of
the
church
zorzi
had
slackened
his
pace
and
that
an
unholy
fire
had
issued
from
his
eyes
his
mouth
and
his
nostrils
while
he
made
strange
signs
in
the
air
with
his
crutch
and
suddenly
grew
to
a
gigantic
stature
the
devils
who
were
his
companions
had
immediately
appeared
in
great
numbers
and
though
the
archers
had
fought
against
their
supernatural
adversaries
with
the
courage
of
heroes
they
had
been
struck
down
senseless
where
they
stood
and
when
they
had
recovered
their
sight
and
their
other
understanding
zorzi
had
long
since
vanished
to
the
kingdom
of
darkness
which
was
his
natural
abode
those
things
the
officer
told
the
governor
on
the
next
day
and
the
men
solemnly
swore
to
them
and
they
were
all
written
down
by
the
official
scribe
but
the
governor
raised
one
eyebrow
a
little
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
twitched
strangely
though
he
made
no
remark
upon
what
had
been
said
he
remembered
however
that
giovanni
had
advised
him
to
send
a
very
strong
force
to
arrest
the
lame
young
man
from
which
he
argued
that
zorzi
had
powerful
friends
and
that
giovanni
knew
it
he
then
visited
the
scene
of
the
fight
and
saw
that
there
were
drops
of
blood
on
dry
stones
which
was
not
astonishing
and
which
gave
no
clue
whatever
to
the
identity
of
the
rescuers
he
pointed
out
quietly
to
his
guide
the
man
who
had
only
received
a
ducking
that
there
were
no
signs
of
fire
on
the
pavement
nor
on
the
walls
of
the
houses
which
was
a
strong
argument
against
any
theory
of
diabolical
intervention
and
this
the
man
was
reluctantly
obliged
to
admit
the
strangest
thing
however
was
that
the
people
who
lived
near
by
seemed
to
have
heard
no
noise
though
one
old
man
who
slept
badly
believed
that
he
had
heard
the
clatter
of
wood
and
iron
falling
together
and
then
a
splashing
in
the
canal
and
indeed
those
were
almost
the
only
sounds
that
had
disturbed
the
night
the
whole
affair
was
shrouded
in
mystery
and
the
governor
who
knew
that
his
men
were
to
be
trusted
as
far
as
their
limited
intelligence
could
go
resolved
to
refer
the
matter
to
the
council
of
ten
without
delay
he
therefore
bade
the
archers
hold
their
tongues
and
refuse
to
talk
of
their
misadventure
on
that
night
giovanni
had
suffered
the
greatest
disappointment
he
remembered
in
his
whole
life
he
had
found
without
much
trouble
the
stone
that
rang
hollow
but
it
had
cost
him
great
pains
to
lift
it
and
the
sweat
ran
down
from
his
forehead
and
dropped
upon
the
slab
as
he
slowly
got
it
up
his
heart
beat
so
that
he
fancied
he
could
hear
it
both
from
the
effort
he
made
and
from
his
intense
excitement
now
that
the
thing
he
had
most
desired
in
the
world
was
within
his
grasp
at
last
the
big
stone
was
raised
upright
and
the
light
of
the
lamp
that
stood
on
the
floor
fell
slanting
across
the
dark
hole
giovanni
brought
the
lamp
to
the
edge
and
looked
in
he
could
not
see
the
box
but
a
quantity
of
loose
earth
lay
there
under
which
it
was
doubtless
buried
he
knelt
down
and
began
to
scoop
the
earth
out
using
his
two
hands
together
then
he
thrust
one
hand
in
and
felt
about
for
the
box
there
was
nothing
there
he
cleared
out
the
cavity
thoroughly
and
tried
to
loosen
the
soil
at
the
bottom
tearing
his
nails
in
his
excitement
it
must
be
there
he
was
sure
but
it
was
not
when
he
realised
that
he
had
been
tricked
he
collapsed
kneeling
as
he
was
and
sat
upon
his
heels
and
his
crooked
hands
all
dark
with
the
dusty
earth
clutched
at
the
stones
beside
him
he
remained
thus
a
long
time
staring
at
the
empty
hole
then
caution
which
was
even
stronger
in
his
nature
than
greed
brought
him
to
himself
his
thin
face
was
grey
and
haggard
as
he
carefully
swept
the
earth
back
to
its
place
removing
all
traces
of
what
he
had
done
then
he
knew
how
foolish
he
had
been
to
let
zorzi
know
what
he
had
partly
heard
and
partly
guessed
of
course
as
soon
as
zorzi
understood
that
giovanni
had
found
out
where
the
book
was
he
had
taken
it
out
and
put
it
away
in
a
safer
place
to
which
giovanni
had
no
clue
at
all
zorzi
was
diabolically
clever
and
would
not
have
been
so
foolish
as
to
hide
the
treasure
again
in
the
same
room
or
in
the
same
way
it
was
probably
in
the
garden
now
but
it
would
take
a
strong
man
a
day
or
two
to
dig
up
all
the
earth
there
to
the
depth
at
which
the
book
must
have
been
buried
zorzi
must
have
done
the
work
at
night
after
the
furnaces
were
out
and
when
there
were
no
night
boys
to
watch
him
but
then
the
boys
had
been
feeding
the
fires
in
the
laboratory
until
the
previous
night
and
it
followed
that
he
must
have
bailed
the
box
this
very
evening
giovanni
got
the
slab
back
into
its
place
without
injuring
it
and
he
rubbed
the
edges
with
dust
and
swept
the
place
with
a
broom
as
zorzi
had
done
twice
already
then
he
took
the
lamp
and
set
it
on
the
table
before
the
window
the
light
fell
on
the
gold
piece
that
lay
there
he
took
it
examined
it
carefully
and
slipped
it
into
his
wallet
with
a
sort
of
mechanical
chuckle
he
glanced
at
the
furnace
next
and
recollected
that
the
precious
pieces
zorzi
had
made
were
in
the
annealing
oven
but
that
did
not
matter
for
the
fires
would
now
go
out
and
the
whole
furnace
would
slowly
cool
so
that
the
annealing
would
be
very
perfect
no
one
but
he
could
enter
the
laboratory
now
that
zorzi
was
gone
and
he
could
take
the
pieces
to
his
own
house
at
his
leisure
they
were
substantial
proofs
of
zorzi
wickedness
in
breaking
the
laws
of
venice
however
and
it
would
perhaps
be
wiser
to
leave
them
where
they
were
until
the
governor
should
take
cognizance
of
their
existence
his
first
disappointment
turned
to
redoubled
hatred
of
the
man
who
had
caused
it
and
whom
it
was
safer
to
hate
now
than
formerly
since
he
was
in
the
clutches
of
the
law
moreover
the
defeat
of
giovanni
hopes
was
by
no
means
final
after
the
first
shock
was
over
he
could
make
an
excuse
for
having
the
garden
dug
over
on
pretence
of
improving
it
during
his
father
absence
the
more
easily
as
he
had
learned
that
the
garden
had
always
been
under
zorzi
care
and
must
now
be
cultivated
by
some
one
else
giovanni
did
not
believe
it
possible
that
the
precious
box
had
been
taken
away
altogether
it
was
therefore
near
and
he
could
find
it
and
there
would
be
plenty
of
time
before
his
father
return
nevertheless
he
looked
about
the
laboratory
and
went
into
the
small
room
where
zorzi
had
slept
there
was
water
there
and
spanish
soap
and
he
washed
his
hands
carefully
and
brushed
the
dust
from
his
coat
and
from
the
knees
of
his
fine
black
hose
he
knew
that
his
patient
wife
would
be
waiting
for
him
when
he
went
back
to
the
house
he
searched
zorzi
room
carefully
but
could
find
nothing
an
earthen
jar
containing
broken
white
glass
stood
in
one
corner
the
narrow
with
its
single
thin
mattress
and
flattened
pillow
all
neat
and
trim
could
not
have
hidden
anything
on
a
line
stretched
across
from
wall
to
wall
a
few
clothes
were
hanging
a
pair
of
disconsolate
brown
hose
the
waistband
on
the
one
side
of
the
line
hanging
down
to
meet
the
feet
on
the
other
two
clean
shirts
and
a
sunday
doublet
on
the
wall
a
cap
with
a
black
eagle
feather
hung
by
a
nail
here
and
there
on
the
white
plaster
zorzi
had
roughly
sketched
with
a
bit
of
charcoal
some
pieces
of
glass
which
he
had
thought
of
making
that
was
all
the
floor
was
paved
with
bricks
and
a
short
examination
showed
that
none
of
them
had
been
moved
giovanni
turned
back
into
the
laboratory
stood
a
moment
looking
disconsolately
at
the
big
stone
which
it
had
cost
him
so
much
fruitless
labour
to
move
and
then
passed
round
by
the
other
side
of
the
furnace
along
the
wall
against
which
the
bench
and
the
easy
chair
were
placed
his
eye
fell
on
marietta
silk
mantle
which
lay
as
when
it
had
slipped
down
from
her
shoulders
the
skirts
of
it
trailing
on
the
floor
his
brows
contracted
suddenly
he
came
nearer
felt
the
stuff
and
was
sure
that
he
recognised
it
then
he
looked
at
it
as
it
lay
it
had
the
unmistakable
appearance
of
having
been
left
as
it
had
been
by
the
person
who
had
last
sat
in
the
chair
two
explanations
of
the
presence
of
the
mantle
in
the
laboratory
suggested
themselves
to
him
at
once
but
the
idea
that
marietta
could
herself
have
been
seated
in
the
chair
not
long
ago
was
so
absurd
that
he
at
once
adopted
the
other
zorzi
had
stolen
the
mantle
and
used
it
for
himself
in
the
evening
confident
that
no
one
would
see
him
he
had
been
surprised
and
had
left
it
in
the
chair
another
and
perhaps
a
crowning
proof
of
his
atrocious
crimes
was
he
not
a
thief
as
well
as
a
liar
and
an
assassin
giovanni
knew
well
enough
that
the
law
would
distinguish
between
stealing
the
art
of
which
was
merely
a
civil
offence
though
a
grave
one
and
stealing
a
mantle
of
silk
which
he
estimated
to
be
worth
at
least
two
or
three
pieces
of
gold
that
was
theft
and
it
was
criminal
and
it
was
one
of
many
crimes
which
zorzi
had
undoubtedly
committed
the
hangman
would
twist
the
rest
out
of
him
with
the
rack
and
the
iron
boot
thought
giovanni
gleefully
the
governor
should
see
the
mantle
with
his
own
eyes
before
he
went
away
he
was
careful
to
fasten
the
window
securely
inside
and
he
locked
the
door
after
him
taking
the
key
he
carried
the
brass
lamp
with
him
for
the
corridor
was
very
dark
and
the
night
was
quite
still
pasquale
was
seated
on
the
edge
of
his
in
his
little
lodge
when
giovanni
came
to
the
door
he
was
more
like
a
big
and
very
ugly
crouching
in
his
kennel
than
anything
else
let
no
one
try
to
go
into
the
laboratory
said
giovanni
setting
down
the
lamp
i
have
locked
it
myself
pasquale
snarled
something
incomprehensible
by
way
of
reply
and
rose
to
let
giovanni
out
he
noticed
that
the
latter
had
brought
nothing
but
the
lamp
with
him
when
the
door
was
open
pasquale
looked
across
at
the
house
and
saw
that
although
there
was
still
light
in
some
of
the
other
windows
marietta
window
was
now
dark
she
was
safe
in
bed
for
giovanni
search
had
occupied
more
than
an
hour
marietta
might
have
breathed
somewhat
more
freely
if
she
had
known
that
her
brother
did
not
even
suspect
her
of
having
been
to
the
laboratory
but
the
knowledge
would
have
been
more
than
balanced
by
a
still
greater
anxiety
if
she
had
been
told
that
zorzi
could
be
accused
of
a
common
theft
she
sat
up
in
the
dark
and
pressed
her
throbbing
temples
with
her
hands
she
thought
if
she
thought
at
all
of
getting
up
again
and
going
back
to
the
pasquale
would
let
her
in
of
course
and
she
could
get
the
mantle
back
but
there
was
nella
in
the
next
room
and
nella
seemed
to
be
always
awake
and
would
hear
her
stirring
and
come
in
to
know
if
she
wanted
anything
besides
she
was
in
the
dark
the
night
light
burned
always
in
nella
room
a
tiny
wick
supported
by
a
bit
of
split
cork
in
an
earthen
cup
of
oil
most
carefully
tended
for
if
it
went
out
it
could
only
be
lighted
by
going
down
to
the
hall
where
a
large
lamp
burned
all
night
marietta
laid
her
head
upon
the
pillow
and
tried
to
sleep
repeating
over
and
over
again
to
herself
that
zorzi
was
safe
but
for
a
long
time
the
thought
of
the
mantle
haunted
her
giovanni
had
found
it
of
course
and
had
brought
it
back
with
him
in
the
morning
he
would
send
for
her
and
demand
an
explanation
and
she
would
have
none
to
give
she
would
have
to
admit
that
she
had
been
in
the
laboratory
it
mattered
little
when
and
that
she
had
forgotten
her
mantle
there
it
would
be
useless
to
deny
it
then
all
at
once
she
looked
the
future
in
the
face
and
she
saw
a
little
light
she
would
refuse
to
answer
giovanni
questions
and
when
her
father
came
back
she
would
tell
him
everything
she
would
tell
him
bravely
that
nothing
could
make
her
marry
contarini
that
she
loved
zorzi
and
would
marry
him
or
no
one
the
mantle
would
probably
be
forgotten
in
the
angry
discussion
that
would
follow
she
hoped
so
for
even
her
father
would
never
forgive
her
for
having
gone
alone
at
night
to
find
zorzi
if
he
ever
found
it
out
he
would
make
her
spend
the
rest
of
her
life
in
a
convent
and
it
would
break
his
heart
that
she
should
have
thus
cast
all
shame
to
the
winds
and
brought
disgrace
on
his
old
age
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
he
could
look
upon
it
in
any
other
way
she
dreaded
to
think
of
the
weeks
that
might
pass
before
he
returned
he
had
spoken
of
making
a
long
journey
and
she
knew
that
he
had
gone
southward
to
rimini
to
please
the
great
sigismondo
malatesta
who
had
heard
of
beroviero
stained
glass
windows
and
mosaics
in
florence
and
naples
and
would
not
be
outdone
in
the
possession
of
beautiful
things
but
no
one
knew
more
than
that
she
was
only
sure
that
he
would
come
back
some
time
before
her
intended
marriage
and
there
would
still
be
time
to
break
it
off
the
thought
gave
her
some
comfort
and
toward
morning
she
fell
into
an
uneasy
sleep
of
all
who
had
played
a
part
in
that
eventful
night
she
slept
the
least
for
she
had
the
most
at
stake
her
fair
name
zorzi
safety
her
whole
future
life
were
in
the
balance
and
she
was
sure
that
giovanni
would
send
for
her
in
the
morning
she
awoke
weary
and
unrefreshed
when
the
sun
was
already
high
she
scarcely
had
energy
to
clap
her
hands
for
nella
and
after
the
window
was
open
she
still
lay
listlessly
on
her
pillow
the
little
woman
looked
at
her
rather
anxiously
but
said
nothing
at
first
setting
the
big
dish
with
fruit
and
water
on
the
table
as
usual
and
busying
herself
with
her
mistress
clothes
she
opened
the
great
carved
wardrobe
and
she
hung
up
some
things
and
took
out
others
in
a
methodical
way
where
is
your
silk
mantle
she
asked
suddenly
as
she
missed
the
garment
from
its
accustomed
place
i
do
not
know
answered
marietta
quite
naturally
for
she
had
expected
the
question
her
reply
was
literally
true
since
she
had
every
reason
for
believing
that
giovanni
had
brought
it
back
with
him
in
the
night
but
could
have
no
idea
as
to
where
he
had
put
it
nella
began
to
search
anxiously
turning
over
everything
in
the
wardrobe
and
the
few
things
that
hung
over
the
chairs
you
could
not
have
put
it
into
the
chest
could
you
she
asked
pausing
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
looking
at
marietta
no
i
am
sure
i
did
not
answered
the
girl
i
never
do
then
it
has
been
stolen
said
nella
and
her
face
darkened
wrathfully
how
is
such
a
thing
possible
asked
marietta
carelessly
it
must
be
somewhere
this
appeared
to
be
certain
but
nella
denied
it
with
energy
her
eyes
fixed
on
marietta
almost
as
angrily
as
if
she
suspected
her
of
having
stolen
her
own
mantle
from
herself
i
tell
you
it
is
not
she
replied
i
have
looked
everywhere
it
has
been
stolen
have
you
looked
in
your
own
room
inquired
marietta
indifferently
and
turning
her
head
on
her
pillow
as
if
she
were
tired
of
meeting
eyes
as
indeed
she
was
my
own
room
indeed
cried
the
maid
indignantly
as
if
i
did
not
know
what
is
in
my
own
room
as
if
your
new
silk
mantle
could
hide
itself
amongst
my
four
rags
why
nella
and
her
kind
to
this
day
use
the
number
four
in
contempt
rather
than
three
or
five
is
a
mystery
of
what
one
might
call
the
psychical
side
of
the
italian
language
marietta
did
not
answer
it
has
been
stolen
nella
repeated
with
gloomy
emphasis
i
trust
no
one
in
this
house
since
your
brother
and
his
wife
have
been
here
with
their
servants
my
was
obliged
to
bring
one
of
her
women
objected
marietta
she
need
not
have
brought
that
shrew
who
walks
about
the
house
all
day
repeating
the
rosary
and
poking
her
long
nose
into
what
does
not
belong
to
her
but
i
am
not
afraid
of
the
signor
giovanni
i
will
tell
the
housekeeper
that
your
mantle
has
been
stolen
and
all
the
women
belongings
shall
be
searched
before
dinner
and
we
shall
find
the
mantle
in
that
evil
person
box
you
must
do
nothing
of
the
sort
answered
marietta
in
a
tone
of
authority
she
sat
up
in
bed
at
last
and
threw
the
thick
braid
of
hair
behind
her
as
every
woman
does
when
her
hair
is
down
if
she
means
to
assert
herself
ah
cried
nella
mockingly
i
see
that
you
are
content
to
lose
your
best
things
without
looking
for
them
then
let
us
throw
everything
out
of
the
window
at
once
we
shall
make
a
fine
figure
i
will
speak
to
my
brother
about
it
myself
said
marietta
indeed
she
thought
it
extremely
likely
that
giovanni
would
oblige
her
to
speak
of
it
within
an
hour
you
will
only
make
trouble
among
the
servants
she
added
oh
as
you
please
snorted
nella
discontentedly
i
only
tell
you
that
i
know
who
took
it
that
is
all
please
to
remember
that
i
said
so
when
it
is
too
late
and
as
for
trouble
there
is
not
one
of
us
in
the
house
who
would
not
like
to
be
searched
for
the
sake
of
sending
your
maid
to
prison
where
she
belongs
nella
said
marietta
i
do
not
care
a
straw
about
the
mantle
i
want
you
to
do
something
very
important
i
am
sure
that
zorzi
has
been
arrested
unjustly
and
i
do
not
believe
that
the
governor
will
keep
him
in
prison
can
you
not
get
your
friend
the
gondolier
to
go
to
the
governor
palace
before
and
ask
whether
zorzi
is
to
be
let
out
of
course
i
can
by
and
by
i
will
call
him
he
is
busy
cleaning
the
gondola
now
marietta
had
spoken
quite
quietly
though
she
had
expected
that
her
voice
would
shake
and
she
had
been
almost
sure
that
she
was
going
to
blush
but
nothing
so
dreadful
happened
though
she
had
prepared
for
it
by
turning
her
back
on
nella
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
slowly
feeling
her
way
into
her
little
yellow
leathern
slippers
it
was
a
relief
to
know
that
even
now
she
could
speak
of
zorzi
without
giving
any
outward
sign
of
emotion
and
she
felt
a
little
encouraged
as
she
began
the
dreaded
day
she
took
a
long
time
in
dressing
for
she
expected
at
every
moment
that
her
maid
would
knock
at
the
door
with
a
message
from
giovanni
bidding
her
come
to
him
before
he
went
out
but
no
one
came
though
it
was
already
past
the
hour
at
which
he
usually
left
the
house
all
at
once
she
heard
his
unmistakable
voice
through
the
open
window
and
on
looking
out
through
the
flowers
she
saw
him
standing
at
the
open
door
of
the
talking
with
the
porter
or
rather
giving
instructions
about
the
garden
which
pasquale
received
in
surly
silence
marietta
listened
in
surprise
it
seemed
impossible
that
giovanni
should
not
take
her
to
task
at
once
if
he
had
found
the
mantle
he
was
not
the
kind
of
man
to
put
off
accusing
any
one
when
he
had
proof
of
guilt
and
was
sure
that
the
law
was
on
his
side
and
marietta
felt
sure
that
the
evidence
against
her
was
overwhelming
for
she
had
yet
to
learn
what
amazing
things
can
be
done
with
impunity
by
people
who
have
the
reputation
of
perfect
innocence
giovanni
was
telling
pasquale
in
a
tone
which
every
one
might
hear
that
he
had
sent
for
a
gardener
who
would
soon
come
with
a
lad
to
help
him
that
the
two
must
be
admitted
at
once
and
that
he
himself
would
be
within
to
receive
them
but
that
no
one
else
was
to
be
allowed
to
go
in
as
he
should
be
extremely
busy
all
the
morning
having
said
these
things
three
or
four
times
over
in
order
to
impress
them
on
mind
he
went
in
the
porter
looked
up
at
marietta
window
a
moment
and
then
followed
him
and
shut
the
door
it
was
clear
that
giovanni
had
no
intention
of
speaking
to
his
sister
before
the
meal
she
breathed
more
freely
since
she
was
to
have
a
respite
of
several
hours
when
she
was
dressed
nella
called
the
gondolier
from
her
own
window
and
met
him
in
the
passage
when
he
came
up
he
at
once
promised
to
make
inquiries
about
zorzi
and
went
off
to
the
palace
to
find
his
friend
and
crony
the
governor
head
boatman
the
latter
it
is
needless
to
say
knew
every
detail
of
the
supernatural
rescue
from
the
archers
who
could
talk
of
nothing
else
in
spite
of
the
governor
prohibition
they
sat
in
a
row
on
the
stone
bench
within
the
main
entrance
a
rueful
crew
their
heads
bound
up
with
a
pleasing
variety
of
bandages
in
an
hour
the
gondolier
returned
laden
with
the
wonderful
story
which
nella
was
the
first
but
not
the
last
to
hear
from
him
her
brown
eyes
seemed
to
be
starting
from
her
head
when
she
came
back
to
tell
it
to
her
mistress
marietta
listened
with
a
beating
heart
though
nella
began
at
once
by
saying
that
zorzi
had
mysteriously
disappeared
and
was
certainly
not
in
prison
when
all
was
told
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
wished
that
she
could
be
alone
to
think
over
what
she
had
heard
but
nella
imagination
was
roused
and
she
was
prepared
to
discuss
the
affair
all
the
morning
the
details
of
it
had
become
more
and
more
numerous
and
circumstantial
as
the
men
with
the
bandaged
heads
recalled
what
they
had
seen
and
heard
the
devils
that
had
delivered
zorzi
all
had
blue
noses
brass
teeth
and
fiery
tails
a
peculiarity
of
theirs
was
that
they
had
six
fingers
with
six
iron
claws
on
each
hand
and
that
all
their
hoofs
were
as
to
their
numbers
they
might
be
roughly
estimated
at
a
thousand
or
so
and
their
roaring
was
like
the
howling
of
the
south
wind
and
the
breaking
of
the
sea
on
the
lido
in
a
winter
storm
it
was
horrible
to
hear
and
would
alone
have
put
all
the
armies
of
the
republic
to
ignominious
flight
nella
thought
these
things
very
interesting
she
wished
that
she
might
talk
with
one
of
the
men
who
had
seen
a
real
devil
i
do
not
believe
a
word
of
all
that
nonsense
said
marietta
the
most
important
thing
is
that
zorzi
got
away
from
them
and
is
not
in
prison
if
he
escaped
by
selling
his
soul
to
the
fiends
said
nella
shaking
her
head
it
is
a
very
evil
thing
her
mistress
disbelief
in
the
blue
noses
and
fiery
tails
was
disconcerting
and
had
a
chilling
effect
on
nella
talkative
mood
the
gondolier
had
crossed
the
bridge
to
tell
his
story
to
pasquale
whose
view
of
the
case
seemed
to
differ
from
nella
he
listened
with
approving
interest
but
without
comment
until
the
gondolier
had
finished
i
could
tell
you
many
such
stories
he
said
things
of
this
kind
often
happen
at
sea
really
exclaimed
the
gondolier
who
was
only
a
boatman
and
regarded
real
sailors
with
a
sort
of
professional
reverence
yes
answered
pasquale
especially
on
sundays
you
must
know
that
when
the
priests
are
all
saying
mass
and
the
people
are
all
praying
the
devils
can
not
bear
it
and
are
driven
out
to
sea
for
the
day
very
strange
things
happen
then
i
assure
you
some
day
i
will
tell
you
how
the
boatswain
of
a
ship
i
once
sailed
in
rove
the
end
of
the
tail
through
a
link
of
the
chain
made
a
flemish
knot
at
the
end
to
stop
it
and
let
go
the
anchor
so
the
devil
went
to
the
bottom
by
the
run
we
unshackled
the
chain
and
wore
the
ship
to
the
wind
and
after
that
we
had
fair
weather
to
the
end
of
the
voyage
it
happened
on
a
sunday
marvellous
cried
the
gondolier
i
should
like
to
hear
the
whole
story
but
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
go
in
and
tell
the
signor
giovanni
what
has
happened
for
he
does
not
know
yet
pasquale
grinned
as
he
stood
in
the
doorway
he
has
given
strict
orders
that
no
one
is
to
be
admitted
this
morning
as
he
is
very
busy
but
this
is
a
very
important
matter
argued
the
gondolier
who
wished
to
have
the
pleasure
of
telling
the
tale
i
can
not
help
it
answered
pasquale
those
are
his
orders
and
i
must
obey
them
you
know
what
his
temper
is
when
he
is
not
pleased
just
then
a
skiff
came
up
the
canal
at
a
great
rate
so
that
the
quick
strokes
of
the
oar
attracted
the
men
attention
they
saw
that
the
boat
was
one
of
those
that
could
be
hired
everywhere
in
venice
the
oarsman
backed
water
with
a
strong
stroke
and
brought
to
at
the
steps
before
the
are
you
not
messer
angelo
beroviero
gondolier
he
inquired
civilly
yes
answered
the
man
addressed
i
am
the
head
gondolier
at
your
service
thank
you
replied
the
boatman
i
am
to
tell
you
that
messer
angelo
has
just
arrived
in
venice
by
sea
from
rimini
on
board
the
a
neapolitan
galliot
now
at
anchor
in
the
giudecca
he
desires
you
to
bring
his
gondola
at
once
to
fetch
him
and
i
am
to
bring
over
his
baggage
in
my
skiff
the
gondolier
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
then
turned
to
pasquale
i
go
he
said
will
you
tell
the
signor
giovanni
that
his
father
is
coming
home
pasquale
grinned
again
he
was
rarely
in
such
a
pleasant
humour
certainly
not
he
answered
the
signor
giovanni
is
very
busy
and
has
given
strict
orders
that
he
is
not
to
be
disturbed
on
any
account
that
is
your
affair
said
the
gondolier
hurrying
away
chapter
xix
a
little
more
than
an
hour
later
the
gondola
came
back
and
stopped
alongside
the
steps
of
the
house
the
gondolier
had
made
such
haste
to
obey
the
summons
that
he
had
not
thought
of
going
into
the
house
to
give
the
servants
warning
and
as
most
of
the
shutters
were
already
drawn
together
against
the
heat
no
one
had
been
looking
out
when
he
went
away
he
had
asked
pasquale
to
tell
the
young
master
and
that
was
all
that
could
be
expected
of
him
there
was
therefore
great
surprise
in
the
household
when
angelo
beroviero
went
up
the
steps
of
his
house
and
his
own
astonishment
that
no
one
should
be
there
to
receive
him
was
almost
as
great
the
gondolier
explained
and
told
him
what
pasquale
had
said
it
was
enough
to
rouse
the
old
man
suspicions
at
once
he
had
left
zorzi
in
charge
of
the
laboratory
enjoining
upon
him
not
to
encourage
giovanni
to
go
there
but
now
giovanni
was
shut
up
there
presumably
with
zorzi
and
had
given
orders
that
he
was
not
to
be
disturbed
the
gondolier
had
not
dared
to
say
anything
about
the
dalmatian
arrest
and
beroviero
was
quite
ignorant
of
all
that
had
happened
he
was
not
a
man
who
hesitated
when
his
suspicions
or
his
temper
were
at
work
and
now
he
turned
without
even
entering
his
home
and
crossed
the
bridge
to
the
pasquale
was
looking
through
the
grating
and
saw
him
coming
and
was
ready
to
receive
him
at
the
open
door
for
the
third
time
on
that
morning
he
grinned
from
ear
to
ear
beroviero
was
pleased
by
the
silent
welcome
of
his
old
and
trusted
servant
you
seem
glad
to
see
me
again
he
said
laying
his
hand
kindly
on
the
old
porter
arm
as
he
passed
in
others
will
be
glad
too
was
the
answer
as
he
went
down
the
corridor
beroviero
heard
the
sound
of
spades
striking
into
the
earth
and
shovelling
it
away
the
gardener
and
his
lad
had
been
at
work
nearly
two
hours
and
had
turned
up
most
of
the
earth
in
the
little
to
a
depth
of
two
or
three
feet
during
that
time
while
giovanni
sat
motionless
under
the
watching
every
movement
of
their
spades
he
rose
nervously
when
he
heard
footsteps
in
the
corridor
for
he
did
not
wish
any
one
to
find
him
seated
there
apparently
watching
a
most
commonplace
operation
with
profound
interest
he
had
made
a
step
towards
the
door
of
the
laboratory
when
he
saw
his
father
emerge
from
the
dark
passage
he
was
a
coward
and
he
trembled
from
head
to
foot
his
teeth
chattered
in
his
head
and
the
cold
sweat
moistened
his
forehead
in
an
instant
the
old
man
stood
still
four
or
five
paces
from
him
and
looked
from
him
to
the
men
who
had
been
digging
on
seeing
the
master
they
stopped
working
and
pulled
off
their
knitted
caps
as
a
further
sign
of
respect
they
wiped
their
dripping
faces
with
their
shirt
sleeves
what
are
you
doing
here
asked
beroviero
in
a
tone
of
displeasure
the
garden
was
very
well
as
it
was
i
i
thought
stammered
giovanni
that
it
would
that
it
might
be
better
to
dig
it
it
would
not
be
better
answered
the
old
man
you
may
go
he
added
speaking
to
the
men
who
were
glad
enough
to
be
dismissed
beroviero
passed
his
son
without
further
words
and
tried
the
door
of
the
laboratory
but
found
it
locked
what
is
this
he
asked
angrily
where
is
zorzi
i
told
him
not
to
leave
you
here
alone
you
had
great
confidence
in
him
answered
giovanni
recovering
himself
a
little
he
is
in
prison
he
took
the
key
from
his
wallet
and
thrust
it
into
the
lock
as
he
spoke
in
prison
cried
beroviero
in
a
loud
voice
what
do
you
mean
giovanni
held
the
door
open
for
him
i
will
tell
you
all
about
zorzi
if
you
will
come
in
he
said
beroviero
entered
stood
still
a
moment
and
looked
about
everything
was
as
zorzi
had
left
it
but
the
ear
missed
the
low
roar
of
the
furnace
instinctively
he
made
a
step
towards
the
latter
extending
his
hand
to
see
whether
it
was
already
cold
but
at
that
moment
he
caught
sight
of
the
silk
mantle
in
the
chair
he
glanced
quickly
at
his
son
has
marietta
been
here
with
you
this
morning
he
asked
sharply
oh
no
answered
giovanni
contemptuously
zorzi
stole
that
thing
and
had
not
time
to
hide
it
when
they
arrested
him
last
night
i
left
it
just
where
it
was
that
the
governor
might
see
it
beroviero
face
changed
slowly
his
fiery
brown
eyes
began
to
show
a
dangerous
light
and
he
stroked
his
long
beard
quickly
twisting
it
a
little
each
time
if
you
say
that
zorzi
stole
marietta
silk
mantle
he
said
slowly
you
are
either
a
fool
or
a
liar
you
are
my
father
answered
giovanni
in
some
perturbation
i
can
not
answer
you
beroviero
was
silent
for
a
long
time
he
took
the
mantle
from
the
chair
examined
it
and
assured
himself
that
it
was
marietta
own
and
no
other
then
he
carefully
folded
it
up
and
laid
it
on
the
bench
his
brows
were
contracted
as
if
he
were
in
great
pain
and
his
face
was
pale
but
his
eyes
were
still
angry
giovanni
knew
the
signs
of
his
father
wrath
and
dared
not
speak
to
him
is
this
the
evidence
on
which
you
have
had
my
man
arrested
asked
beroviero
sitting
down
in
the
big
chair
and
fixing
his
gaze
on
his
son
by
no
means
answered
giovanni
with
all
the
coolness
he
could
command
if
it
pleases
you
to
hear
my
story
from
the
beginning
i
will
tell
you
all
if
you
do
not
hear
all
you
can
not
possibly
understand
i
am
listening
said
old
beroviero
leaning
back
and
laying
his
hands
on
the
broad
wooden
arms
of
the
chair
i
shall
tell
you
everything
exactly
as
it
happened
said
giovanni
and
i
swear
that
it
is
all
true
beroviero
reflected
that
in
his
experience
this
was
usually
the
way
in
which
liars
introduced
their
accounts
of
events
for
truth
is
like
a
work
of
genius
it
carries
conviction
with
it
at
once
and
therefore
needs
no
recommendation
nor
other
artificial
support
after
you
left
giovanni
continued
i
came
here
one
morning
out
of
pure
friendliness
to
zorzi
and
as
we
talked
i
chanced
to
look
at
those
things
on
the
shelf
when
i
admired
them
he
admitted
rather
reluctantly
that
he
had
made
them
and
other
things
which
you
have
in
your
house
beroviero
gravely
nodded
his
assent
to
the
statement
i
asked
him
to
make
me
something
giovanni
went
on
to
say
but
he
told
me
that
he
had
no
white
glass
in
the
furnace
and
that
what
was
there
was
the
result
of
your
experiments
again
beroviero
bent
his
head
so
i
asked
him
to
bring
his
to
the
main
furnace
room
where
they
were
still
working
at
that
time
and
we
went
there
together
he
at
once
made
a
very
beautiful
piece
and
was
just
finishing
it
when
a
bad
accident
happened
to
him
another
man
let
his
fly
from
his
hand
and
it
fell
upon
zorzi
foot
with
a
large
lump
of
hot
glass
beroviero
looked
keenly
at
giovanni
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
it
could
not
have
been
an
accident
he
said
it
was
done
out
of
spite
that
may
be
replied
giovanni
for
the
men
do
not
like
him
as
you
know
but
zorzi
accepted
it
as
being
an
accident
and
said
so
he
was
badly
hurt
and
is
still
lame
nella
dressed
the
wound
and
then
marietta
came
with
her
are
you
sure
marietta
came
here
asked
beroviero
growing
paler
quite
sure
they
were
on
their
way
here
together
early
in
the
morning
when
i
stopped
them
and
asked
marietta
where
she
was
going
and
she
boldly
said
she
was
going
to
see
zorzi
i
could
not
prevent
her
and
i
saw
them
both
go
in
do
you
mean
to
say
that
although
zorzi
was
so
badly
hurt
you
did
not
have
him
brought
to
the
house
of
course
i
proposed
that
at
once
giovanni
answered
but
he
said
that
he
would
not
leave
the
furnace
that
was
like
him
said
old
beroviero
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
it
was
on
that
same
day
that
a
night
boy
told
me
how
he
had
seen
you
and
zorzi
burying
something
in
the
laboratory
the
night
before
you
left
beroviero
started
and
leaned
forward
giovanni
smiled
thoughtfully
for
he
saw
how
his
father
was
moved
and
he
knew
that
the
strongest
part
of
his
story
was
yet
untold
it
would
have
been
better
to
leave
paolo
godi
manuscript
with
me
he
said
in
a
tone
of
sympathy
i
grew
anxious
for
its
safety
as
soon
as
i
knew
that
zorzi
had
charge
of
it
yesterday
morning
i
came
in
again
zorzi
was
sitting
on
the
finishing
a
beautiful
beaker
of
white
glass
white
glass
repeated
beroviero
in
evident
surprise
white
glass
here
yes
answered
giovanni
enjoying
his
triumph
i
pointed
out
that
when
i
had
last
come
there
had
been
no
white
glass
in
the
furnace
he
answered
that
as
one
of
the
experiments
had
produced
a
beautiful
red
colour
which
he
thought
must
be
valuable
he
had
removed
the
crucible
he
also
showed
me
a
specimen
of
it
is
it
here
asked
beroviero
anxiously
where
is
it
giovanni
took
the
specimen
from
the
table
for
zorzi
had
left
it
lying
there
and
he
handed
it
to
his
father
the
latter
took
it
held
it
up
to
the
light
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
and
anger
there
is
only
one
way
of
making
that
he
said
without
hesitation
yes
giovanni
answered
coolly
i
supposed
it
was
made
according
to
one
of
your
secrets
a
quick
look
was
the
only
reply
to
this
speech
giovanni
continued
i
asked
him
to
sell
me
the
piece
of
glass
he
had
been
making
when
he
came
in
and
at
first
he
pretended
that
he
was
not
sure
whether
you
would
allow
it
but
at
last
he
took
a
piece
of
gold
for
it
and
i
was
to
have
it
as
soon
as
it
was
annealed
when
you
see
it
you
will
understand
why
i
was
so
anxious
to
get
it
where
is
it
asked
the
old
man
show
it
to
me
giovanni
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
annealing
oven
and
came
back
a
moment
later
carrying
the
iron
tray
on
which
stood
the
pieces
zorzi
had
made
on
the
previous
morning
beroviero
looked
at
them
critically
tried
their
weight
and
noticed
their
transparency
that
is
not
my
glass
he
said
in
a
tone
of
decision
no
said
giovanni
i
saw
that
it
was
not
your
ordinary
glass
it
seems
much
better
now
zorzi
must
have
made
it
in
a
new
crucible
and
if
he
did
he
made
it
with
some
secret
of
yours
for
it
is
impossible
that
he
should
have
discovered
it
himself
i
said
to
myself
that
if
he
had
made
it
and
the
red
glass
there
he
must
have
opened
the
book
which
you
had
buried
together
in
this
room
and
that
there
was
only
one
way
of
hindering
him
from
learning
everything
in
it
and
ruining
you
and
us
by
setting
up
a
furnace
of
his
own
beroviero
was
looking
hard
at
giovanni
but
he
was
now
thoroughly
alarmed
for
the
safety
of
his
treasured
manuscript
and
listened
with
attention
and
without
any
hostility
the
proofs
seemed
at
first
sight
very
strong
and
after
all
zorzi
was
only
a
dalmatian
and
a
foreigner
who
might
have
yielded
to
temptation
what
did
you
do
asked
beroviero
giovanni
told
him
the
truth
how
he
had
written
a
letter
to
the
governor
and
had
seen
him
in
person
as
well
as
jacopo
contarini
of
course
giovanni
concluded
you
know
best
if
you
find
the
book
as
you
and
he
hid
it
together
he
must
have
learned
your
secrets
in
some
other
way
we
can
easily
see
answered
old
beroviero
rising
quickly
come
here
get
the
crowbar
from
the
corner
and
help
me
to
lift
the
stone
giovanni
took
pains
to
look
for
the
crowbar
exactly
where
it
was
not
for
he
thought
that
this
would
divert
any
lingering
suspicion
from
himself
but
beroviero
was
only
annoyed
there
there
he
cried
pointing
it
is
in
that
corner
quickly
it
would
be
like
the
clever
scoundrel
to
have
copied
what
he
wanted
and
then
to
have
put
the
book
back
into
the
said
giovanni
pausing
do
not
waste
words
my
son
cried
beroviero
in
the
greatest
anxiety
here
this
is
the
stone
get
the
crowbar
in
at
this
side
so
now
we
will
both
heave
there
wedge
the
stone
up
with
that
bit
of
wood
that
will
do
now
let
us
both
get
our
hands
under
it
and
lift
it
up
it
was
done
while
he
was
speaking
a
moment
later
giovanni
had
scooped
out
the
loose
earth
and
beroviero
was
staring
down
into
the
empty
hole
just
as
giovanni
had
done
on
the
previous
night
giovanni
was
almost
consoled
for
his
own
disappointment
when
he
saw
his
father
face
it
is
certainly
gone
he
said
you
did
not
bury
it
deeper
did
you
the
soil
is
hard
below
no
no
it
is
gone
answered
the
old
man
in
a
dull
voice
zorzi
has
got
it
you
see
said
giovanni
mercilessly
when
i
saw
the
red
and
white
glass
which
he
had
made
himself
i
was
so
sure
of
the
truth
that
i
acted
quickly
i
saw
him
arrested
and
i
do
not
think
he
could
have
had
anything
like
a
book
with
him
for
he
was
in
his
doublet
and
hose
and
as
he
is
safe
in
prison
now
he
can
be
made
to
tell
where
he
has
put
the
thing
how
big
was
it
it
was
in
an
iron
box
it
was
heavy
beroviero
spoke
in
low
tones
overcome
by
his
loss
and
by
the
apparent
certainty
that
zorzi
had
betrayed
him
you
see
why
i
should
naturally
suspect
him
of
having
stolen
the
mantle
observed
giovanni
a
man
who
would
betray
your
confidence
in
such
a
way
would
do
anything
yes
yes
answered
the
old
master
vaguely
yes
i
must
go
and
see
him
in
prison
i
was
kind
to
him
and
perhaps
he
may
confess
everything
to
me
we
might
ask
marietta
when
she
first
missed
her
mantle
suggested
giovanni
she
must
have
noticed
that
it
was
gone
she
will
not
remember
answered
beroviero
let
us
go
to
the
governor
house
at
once
there
is
just
time
before
we
can
speak
to
marietta
at
dinner
but
you
must
be
tired
after
your
journey
objected
giovanni
with
unusual
concern
for
his
father
comfort
no
i
slept
well
on
the
ship
i
have
done
nothing
to
tire
me
the
gondola
may
be
still
there
tell
pasquale
to
call
it
over
and
we
will
go
directly
go
on
i
will
follow
you
giovanni
went
forward
and
beroviero
stayed
a
moment
to
look
again
at
the
beautiful
objects
of
white
glass
examining
them
carefully
one
by
one
the
workmanship
was
marvellous
and
he
could
not
help
admiring
it
but
it
was
the
glass
itself
that
disturbed
him
it
was
like
his
own
but
it
was
better
and
the
knowledge
of
its
composition
and
treatment
was
a
fortune
then
too
the
secret
of
dropping
a
piece
of
copper
into
a
certain
mixture
in
order
to
produce
a
particularly
beautiful
red
colour
was
in
the
book
and
the
colour
could
not
be
mistaken
and
was
not
the
one
which
beroviero
had
been
trying
to
produce
he
shook
his
head
sadly
as
he
went
out
and
locked
the
door
behind
him
convinced
against
his
will
that
he
had
been
betrayed
by
the
man
whom
he
had
most
trusted
in
the
world
pasquale
watched
the
two
father
and
son
as
they
got
into
the
gondola
old
beroviero
had
not
even
looked
at
him
as
he
came
out
and
it
was
not
the
porter
business
to
volunteer
information
nor
the
either
but
when
the
latter
was
ordered
to
row
to
the
governor
house
as
fast
as
possible
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
pasquale
who
slowly
nodded
his
ugly
head
before
going
in
again
on
reaching
their
destination
they
were
received
at
once
and
the
governor
told
them
what
had
happened
in
as
few
words
as
possible
nothing
could
exceed
old
beroviero
consternation
and
his
disappointment
zorzi
had
been
rescued
at
the
corner
of
san
church
by
men
who
had
knocked
senseless
the
officer
and
the
six
archers
no
one
knew
who
these
men
were
nor
their
numbers
but
they
were
clearly
friends
of
zorzi
who
had
known
that
he
was
to
be
arrested
accomplices
suggested
giovanni
he
has
stolen
a
valuable
book
of
my
father
containing
secrets
for
making
the
finest
glass
by
this
time
he
is
on
his
way
to
milan
or
florence
i
daresay
said
the
governor
these
foreigners
are
capable
of
anything
i
had
trusted
him
so
confidently
said
beroviero
too
much
overcome
to
be
angry
exactly
answered
the
governor
you
trusted
him
too
much
i
always
thought
so
put
in
giovanni
wisely
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
resumed
beroviero
i
do
not
wish
to
believe
it
of
him
but
i
can
not
deny
the
evidence
of
my
own
senses
i
have
already
sent
a
report
to
the
council
of
ten
said
the
governor
the
most
careful
search
will
be
made
in
venice
for
zorzi
and
his
companions
and
if
they
are
found
they
will
suffer
for
what
they
have
done
i
hope
so
replied
giovanni
heartily
i
remember
that
you
recommended
me
to
send
a
strong
force
observed
the
governor
perhaps
you
knew
that
a
rescue
was
intended
or
you
were
aware
that
the
fellow
had
daring
accomplices
i
only
suspected
it
giovanni
answered
i
knew
nothing
he
was
always
alone
he
has
hardly
been
out
of
my
sight
for
five
years
said
old
beroviero
sadly
he
and
his
son
took
their
leave
the
governor
promising
to
keep
them
informed
as
to
the
progress
of
the
search
at
present
nothing
more
could
be
done
for
zorzi
has
disappeared
altogether
and
old
beroviero
was
much
inclined
to
share
his
son
opinion
that
the
fugitive
was
already
on
his
way
to
milan
or
florence
where
the
possession
of
the
secrets
would
insure
him
a
large
fortune
very
greatly
to
the
injury
of
beroviero
and
all
the
of
murano
the
two
men
returned
to
the
house
in
silence
for
the
elder
was
too
much
absorbed
by
his
own
thoughts
to
speak
and
giovanni
was
too
wise
to
interrupt
reflections
which
undoubtedly
tended
to
zorzi
destruction
marietta
was
awaiting
her
father
return
with
much
anxiety
for
every
one
knew
that
the
master
had
gone
first
to
the
laboratory
and
then
to
the
governor
palace
with
giovanni
so
that
the
two
must
have
been
talking
together
a
long
time
marietta
waited
with
her
in
the
lower
hall
slowly
walking
up
and
down
when
her
father
came
up
the
low
steps
at
last
she
went
forward
to
meet
him
and
a
glance
told
her
that
he
was
in
the
most
extreme
anxiety
she
took
his
hand
and
kissed
it
in
the
customary
manner
and
he
bent
a
little
and
touched
her
forehead
with
his
lips
then
to
her
surprise
he
put
one
hand
under
her
chin
and
laid
the
other
on
the
top
of
her
head
and
with
gentle
force
made
her
look
at
him
giovanni
wife
was
there
and
most
of
the
servants
were
standing
near
the
foot
of
the
staircase
to
welcome
their
master
beroviero
said
nothing
as
he
gazed
into
his
daughter
eyes
they
met
his
own
fearlessly
enough
and
she
opened
them
wide
as
she
rarely
did
as
if
to
show
that
she
had
nothing
to
conceal
but
while
he
looked
at
her
the
blood
rose
blushing
in
her
cheeks
telling
that
there
was
something
to
hide
after
all
and
as
she
would
not
turn
her
eyes
from
his
they
sparkled
a
little
with
vexation
beroviero
did
not
speak
but
he
let
her
go
and
went
on
towards
the
stairs
bending
his
head
graciously
to
the
other
persons
who
were
assembled
to
greet
him
he
was
a
man
of
strong
character
and
of
much
natural
dignity
far
too
proud
to
break
down
under
a
great
loss
or
a
bitter
disappointment
and
at
dinner
he
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
spoke
affably
of
the
journey
he
had
made
explaining
his
unexpectedly
early
return
by
the
fact
that
the
lord
of
rimini
had
at
once
approved
his
designs
and
accepted
his
terms
occasionally
giovanni
asked
a
respectful
question
but
neither
his
wife
nor
marietta
said
much
during
the
meal
zorzi
was
not
mentioned
you
are
welcome
at
my
house
my
son
beroviero
said
when
they
had
finished
but
i
suppose
that
you
will
go
back
to
your
own
this
evening
this
was
of
course
a
command
and
marietta
thought
it
a
good
omen
she
had
felt
sure
when
her
father
made
her
look
at
him
that
giovanni
had
spoken
to
him
of
the
mantle
but
in
what
way
she
could
not
tell
perhaps
though
it
seemed
incredible
he
would
not
make
such
a
serious
case
of
it
as
she
had
expected
he
said
nothing
when
he
withdrew
to
rest
during
the
hot
hours
of
the
afternoon
and
she
went
to
her
own
room
as
every
one
did
at
that
time
little
as
she
had
slept
that
night
she
felt
that
it
would
be
intolerable
to
lie
down
so
she
took
her
little
basket
of
beads
and
tried
to
work
nella
was
dozing
in
the
next
room
from
time
to
time
the
young
girl
leaned
back
in
her
chair
with
eyes
and
a
look
of
pain
came
over
her
face
then
with
an
effort
she
took
her
needle
once
more
and
picked
out
the
beads
threading
them
one
by
one
in
a
regular
succession
of
colours
she
was
sure
that
if
zorzi
were
near
he
would
have
already
found
some
means
of
informing
her
that
he
was
really
in
safety
he
must
have
friends
of
whom
she
knew
nothing
and
who
had
rescued
him
at
great
risk
he
would
surely
trust
one
of
them
to
take
a
message
or
to
make
a
signal
which
she
could
understand
she
sat
near
the
window
and
the
shutters
were
half
closed
so
as
to
leave
a
space
through
which
she
could
look
out
from
time
to
time
she
glanced
at
the
white
line
of
the
footway
opposite
over
which
the
shadow
of
the
was
beginning
to
creep
as
the
sun
moved
westward
but
no
one
appeared
when
it
was
cool
pasquale
would
probably
come
out
and
look
three
times
up
and
down
the
canal
as
he
always
did
giovanni
would
not
go
to
the
laboratory
again
perhaps
her
father
would
go
when
he
was
rested
then
if
she
chose
she
could
take
nella
and
join
him
and
since
there
was
to
be
an
explanation
with
him
she
would
rather
have
it
in
the
laboratory
where
they
would
be
quite
alone
she
had
fully
made
up
her
mind
to
tell
him
at
the
very
first
interview
that
she
would
not
marry
jacopo
contarini
under
any
circumstances
but
she
had
not
decided
whether
she
would
add
that
she
loved
zorzi
she
hated
anything
like
cowardice
and
it
would
be
cowardly
to
put
off
telling
the
truth
any
longer
but
what
concerned
zorzi
was
her
secret
and
she
had
a
right
to
choose
the
most
favourable
moment
for
making
a
revelation
on
which
her
whole
life
and
zorzi
also
must
immediately
depend
she
felt
weak
and
tired
for
she
had
eaten
little
and
hardly
slept
at
all
but
her
determination
was
strong
and
she
would
act
upon
it
occasionally
she
rose
and
moved
wearily
about
the
room
looked
out
between
the
shutters
and
then
sat
down
again
she
was
in
one
of
those
moments
of
life
in
which
all
existence
seems
drawn
out
to
an
endless
quivering
thread
a
single
throbbing
nerve
stretched
to
its
utmost
point
of
strain
the
silence
was
broken
by
a
man
footstep
in
the
passage
coming
towards
her
door
a
moment
later
she
heard
her
father
voice
asking
if
he
might
come
in
almost
at
the
same
time
she
opened
and
beroviero
stood
on
the
threshold
nella
had
heard
him
speaking
too
and
she
started
up
wide
awake
in
an
instant
and
came
in
to
see
if
she
were
needed
will
you
go
with
me
to
the
laboratory
my
dear
asked
the
old
man
quietly
she
answered
gravely
that
she
would
there
was
no
gladness
in
her
tone
but
no
reluctance
she
was
facing
the
most
difficult
situation
she
had
ever
known
and
perhaps
the
most
dangerous
very
well
said
her
father
let
nella
give
you
your
silk
mantle
and
we
will
go
at
once
before
marietta
could
have
answered
even
if
she
had
known
what
to
say
nella
had
begun
her
tale
of
woe
the
mantle
was
stolen
the
shrew
of
a
maid
who
belonged
to
the
signor
giovanni
wife
had
stolen
it
the
house
ought
to
be
searched
at
once
and
so
much
more
to
the
same
effect
that
nella
was
obliged
to
pause
for
breath
when
did
you
miss
it
asked
beroviero
looking
hard
at
the
this
morning
sir
it
was
here
last
night
i
am
quite
sure
the
truthful
little
brown
eyes
did
not
waver
and
it
can
not
have
been
any
one
else
continued
nella
this
is
a
very
evil
person
sir
and
she
sometimes
comes
here
with
a
message
or
making
believe
that
she
is
helping
me
as
if
i
needed
help
indeed
do
not
accuse
people
of
stealing
when
you
have
no
evidence
against
them
answered
beroviero
somewhat
sternly
give
your
mistress
something
else
to
throw
over
her
give
me
the
green
silk
cloak
said
marietta
who
was
anxious
not
to
be
questioned
about
the
mantle
it
has
a
spot
in
one
corner
nella
answered
discontentedly
as
she
went
to
the
wardrobe
the
spot
turned
out
to
be
no
bigger
than
the
head
of
a
pin
a
moment
later
marietta
and
her
father
were
going
downstairs
at
the
door
of
the
pasquale
eyed
them
with
approbation
and
marietta
smiled
and
said
a
word
to
him
as
she
passed
it
seemed
strange
that
she
should
have
trusted
the
ugly
old
man
with
a
secret
which
she
dared
not
tell
her
own
father
beroviero
did
not
speak
as
she
followed
him
down
the
path
and
stood
waiting
while
he
unlocked
the
door
then
they
both
entered
and
he
laid
his
cap
upon
the
table
there
is
your
mantle
my
dear
he
said
quietly
and
he
pointed
to
it
neatly
folded
and
lying
on
the
bench
marietta
started
for
she
was
taken
unawares
while
in
her
own
room
her
father
had
spoken
so
naturally
as
to
make
it
seem
quite
possible
that
giovanni
had
said
nothing
about
it
to
him
yet
he
had
known
exactly
where
it
was
he
was
facing
her
now
as
he
spoke
it
was
found
here
last
night
after
zorzi
had
been
arrested
said
beroviero
do
you
understand
yes
marietta
answered
gathering
all
her
courage
we
will
talk
about
it
by
and
by
first
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
which
is
much
more
important
than
anything
concerning
the
mantle
will
you
sit
down
father
and
hear
me
as
patiently
as
you
can
i
am
learning
patience
said
beroviero
sitting
down
in
his
chair
i
am
learning
also
the
meaning
of
such
words
as
ingratitude
betrayal
and
treachery
which
were
never
before
spoken
in
my
house
he
sighed
and
leaned
back
looking
at
the
wall
marietta
dropped
her
cloak
beside
the
mantle
on
the
bench
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
before
him
trying
to
begin
her
speech
but
she
could
not
find
any
words
speak
child
said
her
father
what
has
happened
it
seems
to
me
that
i
could
bear
almost
anything
now
she
stood
still
a
moment
before
him
still
hesitating
she
now
saw
that
he
had
suffered
more
than
she
had
suspected
doubtless
owing
to
arrest
and
disappearance
and
she
knew
that
what
she
meant
to
tell
him
would
hurt
him
much
more
father
she
began
at
last
with
a
great
effort
i
know
that
what
i
am
going
to
say
will
displease
you
very
very
much
i
am
sorry
i
wish
it
were
not
suddenly
her
set
speech
broke
down
she
fell
on
her
knees
and
took
his
hands
looking
up
beseechingly
to
his
face
forgive
me
she
cried
oh
for
god
sake
forgive
me
i
can
not
marry
jacopo
contarini
beroviero
had
not
expected
that
he
sat
upright
in
the
chair
in
his
amazement
and
instinctively
tried
to
draw
his
hands
out
of
hers
but
she
held
them
fast
gazing
earnestly
up
to
him
his
look
was
not
angry
nor
cold
nor
did
he
even
seem
hurt
he
was
simply
astonished
beyond
all
measure
by
the
enormous
audacity
of
what
she
said
as
yet
he
did
not
connect
it
with
anything
else
i
think
you
must
be
mad
that
was
all
he
could
find
to
say
chapter
xx
marietta
shook
her
head
she
still
knelt
at
her
father
feet
holding
his
hands
i
am
not
mad
she
said
i
am
in
earnest
i
can
not
marry
him
it
is
impossible
you
must
marry
him
answered
beroviero
you
are
betrothed
to
him
and
it
would
be
an
insult
to
his
family
to
break
off
the
marriage
now
besides
you
have
no
reason
to
give
not
the
shadow
of
a
reason
marietta
dropped
his
hands
and
rose
to
her
feet
lightly
she
had
expected
a
terrific
outburst
of
anger
which
would
gradually
subside
after
which
she
hoped
to
find
words
with
which
to
influence
him
but
like
many
men
he
was
sometimes
unexpectedly
calm
at
critical
moments
as
if
he
were
really
able
to
control
his
nature
when
he
chose
she
now
almost
wished
that
he
would
break
out
in
a
rage
as
women
sometimes
hope
we
may
for
they
know
it
is
far
easier
to
deal
with
an
angry
man
than
with
a
determined
one
i
will
not
marry
him
she
said
at
last
with
strong
emphasis
and
almost
defiantly
my
child
beroviero
answered
gravely
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
saying
i
do
cried
marietta
with
some
indignation
i
have
thought
of
it
a
long
time
i
was
very
wrong
not
to
make
up
my
mind
from
the
beginning
and
i
ask
your
forgiveness
in
my
heart
i
always
knew
that
i
could
not
do
it
in
the
end
and
i
should
have
said
so
at
once
it
was
a
great
mistake
there
is
no
question
of
your
consent
replied
beroviero
with
conviction
if
girls
were
consulted
as
to
the
men
they
were
to
marry
the
world
would
soon
come
to
an
end
this
is
only
a
passing
madness
of
which
you
should
be
heartily
ashamed
say
no
more
about
it
on
the
appointed
day
the
wedding
will
take
place
it
will
not
said
marietta
firmly
and
you
will
do
better
to
let
it
be
known
at
once
it
is
of
no
use
to
take
heaven
to
witness
and
to
make
a
solemn
oath
i
merely
say
that
i
will
not
marry
jacopo
contarini
you
may
carry
me
to
the
church
you
may
drag
me
before
the
altar
but
i
will
resist
i
will
scream
out
that
i
will
not
and
the
priest
himself
will
protect
me
that
will
be
a
much
greater
scandal
than
if
you
go
to
the
contarini
family
and
tell
them
that
your
daughter
is
mad
if
you
really
think
i
am
you
are
undoubtedly
beside
yourself
at
the
present
moment
beroviero
answered
but
it
will
pass
i
hope
not
while
i
am
alive
and
i
shall
certainly
resist
to
the
end
it
would
be
much
wiser
of
you
to
send
me
to
a
convent
at
once
than
to
count
on
forcing
me
to
go
through
the
marriage
ceremony
beroviero
stared
at
her
and
stroked
his
beard
he
began
to
believe
that
she
might
possibly
be
in
earnest
since
she
talked
so
quietly
of
going
to
a
convent
a
fate
which
most
girls
considered
the
most
terrible
that
could
be
imagined
he
bent
his
brows
in
thought
but
watched
her
steadily
you
have
not
yet
given
me
a
single
reason
for
all
this
wild
talk
he
said
after
a
pause
it
is
absurd
to
think
that
without
some
good
cause
you
are
suddenly
filled
with
repulsion
for
marriage
or
for
jacopo
contarini
i
have
heard
of
young
women
who
were
betrothed
but
who
felt
a
religious
vocation
and
refused
to
marry
for
that
reason
it
never
seemed
a
very
satisfactory
one
to
me
for
if
there
is
any
condition
in
which
a
woman
needs
religion
it
is
the
marriage
state
he
paused
in
his
speech
pleased
with
his
own
idea
in
spite
of
all
his
troubles
marietta
had
moved
a
few
steps
away
from
him
and
stood
beside
the
table
looking
down
at
the
things
on
it
without
seeing
them
but
you
do
not
even
make
religion
a
pretext
pursued
her
father
have
you
no
reason
to
give
i
do
not
expect
a
good
one
for
none
can
have
any
weight
but
i
should
like
to
hear
the
best
you
have
it
is
a
very
convincing
one
to
me
marietta
replied
still
looking
down
at
the
table
but
i
think
i
had
better
not
tell
it
to
you
she
added
it
would
make
you
angry
no
said
beroviero
one
can
not
be
angry
with
people
who
are
really
out
of
their
senses
i
am
not
so
mad
as
you
think
answered
the
girl
i
have
told
you
of
my
decision
because
it
was
cowardly
of
me
not
to
tell
you
what
i
felt
before
you
went
away
but
it
might
be
a
mistake
to
tell
you
more
you
have
had
enough
to
harass
you
already
since
you
came
back
you
are
suddenly
very
considerate
no
i
have
not
been
considerate
i
could
not
be
without
acting
a
lie
to
you
by
letting
you
believe
that
i
meant
to
marry
messer
jacopo
and
i
will
not
do
that
any
longer
since
i
know
that
it
is
a
lie
but
i
can
not
see
the
use
of
saying
anything
more
you
had
better
tell
me
the
whole
truth
rather
than
let
me
think
something
that
may
be
much
worse
answered
beroviero
changing
his
attitude
there
is
nothing
in
the
truth
of
which
i
am
ashamed
said
marietta
holding
up
her
head
proudly
i
have
done
nothing
which
i
did
not
believe
to
be
right
however
strange
it
may
seem
to
you
once
more
their
eyes
met
and
they
gazed
steadily
at
each
other
and
again
the
blush
spread
over
her
cheeks
beroviero
put
out
his
hand
and
touched
the
folded
mantle
marietta
he
said
zorzi
has
stolen
my
precious
book
of
secrets
and
has
disappeared
with
it
they
tell
me
that
he
also
stole
this
mantle
for
it
was
found
here
just
after
he
was
arrested
last
night
is
it
true
or
has
he
stolen
my
daughter
instead
marietta
face
had
darkened
when
he
began
to
accuse
the
absent
man
at
the
question
that
followed
she
started
a
little
and
drew
herself
up
zorzi
is
neither
a
thief
nor
a
traitor
she
answered
if
you
mean
to
ask
me
whether
i
love
him
is
that
what
you
mean
she
paused
with
flashing
eyes
yes
answered
her
father
and
his
voice
shook
then
yes
i
love
him
with
all
my
heart
and
i
have
loved
him
long
that
is
why
i
will
not
marry
jacopo
contarini
you
know
my
secret
now
beroviero
groaned
aloud
and
his
head
sank
as
he
grasped
the
arms
of
the
chair
his
daughter
loved
the
man
who
had
cheated
him
betrayed
him
and
robbed
him
it
was
almost
too
much
to
bear
he
had
nothing
to
say
for
no
words
could
tell
what
he
felt
then
and
he
silently
bowed
his
head
as
for
the
accusations
you
bring
against
him
marietta
said
after
a
moment
they
are
false
from
first
to
last
and
i
can
prove
to
you
that
every
one
of
them
is
an
abominable
lie
you
can
not
make
that
untrue
which
i
have
seen
with
my
eyes
i
can
though
zorzi
has
the
right
to
prove
his
innocence
himself
i
may
say
too
much
for
i
am
not
as
generous
as
he
is
do
you
know
that
when
they
tried
to
kill
him
in
the
furnace
room
and
lamed
him
for
life
he
told
every
one
even
me
that
it
was
an
accident
he
is
so
brave
and
noble
that
when
he
comes
here
again
he
will
not
tell
you
that
it
was
your
own
son
who
tried
to
rob
you
who
did
everything
in
his
power
to
get
zorzi
away
from
this
room
in
order
to
search
for
your
manuscript
and
who
at
last
as
everything
else
failed
persuaded
the
governor
to
arrest
him
he
will
not
tell
you
that
and
he
does
not
know
that
before
they
had
taken
him
twenty
paces
from
the
door
giovanni
was
already
here
locked
in
and
trying
the
stones
with
a
hammer
to
find
out
which
one
covered
the
precious
book
did
giovanni
tell
you
that
this
morning
no
zorzi
would
not
tell
you
all
the
truth
and
i
know
some
of
it
even
better
than
he
but
zorzi
was
always
generous
and
brave
beroviero
had
lifted
his
head
now
and
was
looking
hard
at
her
and
your
mantle
how
came
it
here
he
asked
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
now
but
to
speak
the
truth
it
is
here
said
marietta
growing
paler
because
i
came
here
unknown
to
any
one
except
pasquale
who
let
me
in
because
i
came
alone
last
night
to
warn
the
man
i
love
that
giovanni
had
planned
his
destruction
and
to
save
him
if
i
could
in
my
haste
i
left
the
mantle
in
that
chair
of
yours
in
which
i
had
been
sitting
it
slipped
from
my
shoulders
as
i
sat
and
there
giovanni
must
have
found
it
if
you
had
seen
it
there
you
would
know
that
what
i
say
is
true
i
did
see
it
said
beroviero
giovanni
left
it
where
it
was
and
i
folded
it
myself
this
morning
zorzi
did
not
steal
the
mantle
i
take
back
that
accusation
nor
has
he
stolen
your
secrets
take
that
back
too
if
you
are
just
you
always
were
till
now
i
have
searched
the
place
where
he
and
i
put
the
book
and
it
is
not
there
giovanni
searched
it
twelve
hours
earlier
and
it
was
already
gone
zorzi
saved
it
from
your
son
and
then
in
his
rage
i
suppose
that
giovanni
accused
him
of
stealing
it
he
may
even
have
believed
it
for
i
can
be
just
too
but
it
is
not
true
the
book
is
safe
zorzi
took
it
with
him
said
beroviero
you
are
mistaken
before
he
was
arrested
he
said
that
i
ought
to
know
where
it
was
in
case
anything
happened
to
him
in
order
to
tell
you
beroviero
rose
slowly
staring
at
her
and
speaking
with
an
effort
you
know
where
it
is
he
told
you
he
has
not
taken
it
away
marietta
smiled
in
perfect
certainty
of
victory
i
know
where
it
is
she
said
where
is
it
he
asked
in
extreme
anxiety
for
he
could
hardly
believe
what
he
heard
i
will
not
tell
you
yet
was
the
unexpected
answer
marietta
gave
him
and
you
can
not
possibly
find
it
unless
i
do
the
veins
stood
out
on
the
old
man
temples
in
an
instant
and
the
old
angry
fire
came
back
to
his
eyes
do
you
dare
to
tell
me
that
you
will
not
show
me
the
place
where
the
book
is
on
the
very
instant
he
cried
oh
yes
answered
marietta
i
dare
that
and
much
more
i
am
not
a
coward
like
my
brother
you
know
i
will
not
tell
you
the
secret
till
you
promise
me
something
you
are
trying
to
sell
me
what
is
my
own
he
answered
angrily
you
are
in
league
with
zorzi
against
me
to
break
off
your
marriage
but
i
will
not
do
it
you
shall
tell
me
where
the
book
is
if
you
refuse
you
shall
repent
it
as
long
as
you
live
i
will
he
stopped
short
in
his
speech
as
he
met
her
disdainful
look
you
never
threatened
me
before
she
said
why
do
you
think
that
you
can
frighten
me
give
me
what
is
mine
said
the
old
man
angrily
that
is
all
i
demand
i
am
not
threatening
set
me
free
from
messer
jacopo
and
you
shall
have
it
answered
marietta
no
you
shall
marry
him
i
will
not
but
i
will
keep
your
book
until
you
change
your
mind
or
else
but
no
if
i
gave
it
to
zorzi
he
is
so
honourable
that
he
would
bring
it
back
to
you
without
so
much
as
looking
into
it
i
will
keep
it
for
myself
or
i
will
burn
it
she
felt
that
if
she
had
been
a
man
she
could
not
have
taken
such
an
unfair
advantage
of
him
but
she
was
a
defenceless
girl
fighting
for
the
liberty
of
her
whole
life
that
might
excuse
much
she
thought
by
this
time
beroviero
was
very
angry
he
stalked
up
and
down
beside
the
furnace
trailing
his
thin
silk
gown
behind
him
stroking
his
beard
with
a
quick
impatient
movement
and
easting
fierce
glances
at
marietta
from
time
to
time
he
was
not
used
to
being
at
the
mercy
of
circumstances
still
less
to
having
his
mind
made
up
for
him
by
his
son
and
his
daughter
giovanni
had
made
him
believe
that
zorzi
had
turned
traitor
and
thief
after
five
years
of
faithful
service
and
the
conviction
had
cut
him
to
the
quick
and
now
marietta
had
demonstrated
zorzi
innocence
almost
beyond
doubt
but
had
made
matters
worse
in
other
ways
and
was
taking
the
high
hand
with
him
he
did
not
realise
that
from
the
moment
when
she
had
boldly
confessed
what
she
had
done
and
had
declared
her
love
for
zorzi
his
confidence
in
her
had
returned
by
quick
degrees
and
that
the
atrocious
crime
of
having
come
secretly
at
night
to
the
laboratory
had
become
in
his
eyes
and
perhaps
against
his
will
a
mere
pardonable
piece
of
rashness
since
if
zorzi
was
innocent
anything
which
could
save
him
from
unjust
imprisonment
might
well
be
forgiven
he
had
borne
what
seemed
to
him
very
great
misfortunes
with
fortitude
and
dignity
but
his
greatest
treasures
were
safe
his
daughter
and
paolo
godi
manuscript
and
he
became
furiously
angry
with
marietta
because
she
had
him
in
her
power
if
a
man
is
seated
a
woman
who
intends
to
get
the
better
of
him
generally
stands
but
if
he
loses
his
temper
and
begins
to
walk
about
she
immediately
seats
herself
and
assumes
an
exasperating
calmness
of
manner
accordingly
marietta
sat
down
on
a
small
chair
near
the
table
and
watched
her
father
in
silence
persuaded
that
he
would
be
obliged
to
yield
in
the
end
no
one
has
ever
dared
to
browbeat
me
in
this
way
in
my
whole
life
cried
the
old
man
fiercely
and
his
voice
shook
with
rage
will
you
listen
to
me
asked
marietta
with
sudden
meekness
listen
to
you
he
repeated
instantly
have
i
not
been
listening
to
you
for
hours
i
do
not
know
how
long
it
may
have
been
answered
the
girl
but
i
have
much
more
to
say
you
are
so
angry
that
you
will
not
hear
me
angry
i
are
you
telling
me
that
i
am
so
beside
myself
with
rage
that
i
can
not
understand
reason
i
did
not
say
that
you
meant
it
then
what
did
you
say
you
have
forgotten
what
you
said
already
just
like
a
girl
and
you
pretend
to
argue
with
me
with
your
own
father
it
is
beyond
belief
silence
i
say
do
not
answer
me
marietta
sat
quite
still
and
began
to
look
at
her
nails
which
were
very
pink
and
well
shaped
after
a
short
silence
beroviero
stopped
before
her
well
he
cried
why
do
you
not
speak
his
eyes
blazed
and
he
tapped
the
pavement
with
his
foot
she
raised
her
eyebrows
smiled
a
little
wearily
and
sighed
i
misunderstood
you
she
said
with
exasperating
patience
i
thought
you
told
me
to
be
silent
you
always
misunderstand
me
he
answered
angrily
and
walking
off
again
you
always
did
and
you
always
will
i
believe
you
do
it
on
purpose
but
i
will
make
you
understand
you
shall
know
what
i
mean
i
should
be
so
glad
said
marietta
pray
tell
me
what
you
mean
this
was
too
much
he
turned
sharply
in
his
walk
i
mean
you
to
marry
contarini
he
cried
out
with
a
stamp
of
the
foot
and
you
mean
never
to
see
paolo
godi
manuscript
again
suggested
marietta
quietly
perdition
take
the
accursed
thing
roared
the
old
man
if
i
only
knew
where
you
have
put
it
it
is
where
you
can
never
never
find
it
marietta
answered
so
it
is
of
no
use
to
be
angry
with
me
is
it
the
more
angry
you
are
the
less
likely
it
is
that
i
shall
tell
you
but
i
will
tell
you
something
else
father
something
you
never
understood
before
my
marriage
was
to
have
been
a
bargain
a
great
name
for
a
fortune
half
your
fortune
for
a
great
name
and
an
alliance
with
the
contarini
perhaps
one
was
worth
the
other
i
know
very
little
of
such
things
but
it
chances
that
i
can
have
a
word
to
say
about
the
bargain
too
would
any
one
say
that
i
was
doing
very
wrong
if
i
gave
that
book
to
my
brother
for
instance
giovanni
would
not
give
it
back
to
you
as
zorzi
would
i
am
quite
sure
what
abominable
scheme
is
this
beroviero
fairly
trembled
in
his
fury
i
offer
you
a
simple
bargain
marietta
answered
unmoved
i
will
give
you
your
manuscript
for
my
freedom
will
you
take
it
father
or
will
you
insist
upon
trying
to
marry
me
by
force
and
let
me
give
the
book
to
giovanni
yes
that
is
what
i
will
do
then
i
will
marry
zorzi
and
go
away
silence
child
you
marry
a
stranger
a
dalmatian
a
servant
but
i
love
him
you
may
call
him
a
servant
if
you
choose
it
would
make
no
difference
to
me
if
it
were
true
he
would
not
be
less
brave
less
loyal
or
less
worthy
if
he
were
forced
to
clean
your
shoes
in
order
to
live
instead
of
sharing
your
art
with
you
did
he
ever
lie
to
you
no
cried
the
old
man
i
would
have
broken
his
bones
did
he
ever
betray
a
secret
since
you
know
that
the
book
is
safe
no
have
you
trusted
him
far
more
than
your
own
sons
for
many
years
yes
of
course
then
call
him
your
servant
if
you
like
and
call
your
sons
what
you
please
concluded
marietta
but
do
not
tell
me
that
such
a
man
is
not
good
enough
to
be
the
husband
of
a
daughter
who
does
not
want
a
great
name
nor
a
palace
nor
a
husband
who
sits
in
the
grand
council
do
not
say
that
father
for
it
would
not
be
true
and
you
never
told
a
lie
in
your
life
i
tell
you
that
marriage
has
nothing
to
do
with
all
this
he
began
walking
again
to
keep
his
temper
hot
for
he
was
dimly
conscious
that
he
was
getting
the
worst
of
the
encounter
and
that
her
arguments
were
good
and
i
tell
you
that
a
marriage
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
love
and
with
honour
and
with
trust
is
no
marriage
at
all
answered
the
girl
say
what
you
please
of
customs
and
traditions
and
of
station
and
all
that
god
never
meant
that
an
innocent
girl
should
be
bought
and
sold
like
a
slave
or
a
horse
for
a
name
nor
for
money
nor
for
any
imaginary
advantage
to
herself
or
to
her
father
i
know
what
our
privilege
is
that
the
patricians
may
marry
us
and
not
lose
their
rank
i
would
rather
keep
my
own
and
marry
a
even
if
i
were
to
be
sold
do
you
know
what
your
money
would
buy
for
me
in
venice
the
privilege
of
being
despised
and
slighted
by
patricians
and
great
ladies
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
it
would
all
end
there
in
spite
of
all
you
may
give
they
want
your
money
you
want
their
name
because
you
are
rich
and
you
have
always
been
taught
to
think
that
the
chief
use
of
money
is
to
rise
in
the
world
will
you
teach
me
what
i
am
to
think
asked
old
beroviero
amazed
by
her
sudden
flow
of
words
yes
she
answered
before
he
could
say
more
i
will
teach
you
what
you
should
think
what
you
should
have
always
thought
a
man
as
brave
and
upright
and
honest
in
everything
as
you
are
you
should
think
you
should
know
that
your
daughter
has
a
right
to
live
a
right
to
be
free
and
a
right
to
love
like
every
living
creature
god
ever
made
this
is
the
most
abominable
rebellion
retorted
beroviero
i
can
not
imagine
where
you
learned
rebellion
she
cried
interrupting
him
in
ringing
tones
yes
it
is
rank
rebellion
sedition
and
revolt
against
slavery
for
life
and
love
and
freedom
you
wonder
where
i
have
learned
to
turn
and
face
this
oppression
of
the
world
instead
of
yielding
to
it
one
more
unhappy
woman
among
the
thousands
that
are
bought
and
sold
into
wifehood
every
year
i
have
learned
nothing
my
heart
needed
no
teaching
for
that
it
is
enough
that
i
love
an
honest
man
truly
i
know
that
it
is
wrong
to
promise
my
faith
to
another
and
that
it
is
a
worse
wrong
in
you
to
try
to
get
that
promise
from
me
by
force
a
vow
that
could
be
nothing
but
a
solemn
lie
would
the
ring
on
my
finger
be
a
charm
to
make
me
forget
would
the
priest
words
and
blessing
be
a
spell
to
root
out
of
my
heart
what
is
the
best
part
of
my
life
better
go
to
a
nunnery
and
weep
for
the
truth
than
to
hope
for
peace
in
such
a
lie
as
that
better
a
thousand
thousand
times
she
had
risen
now
and
was
almost
eloquent
facing
her
father
with
flashing
eyes
oh
you
have
always
been
kind
to
me
good
to
me
dear
to
me
she
went
on
quickly
it
is
only
in
this
that
you
will
not
understand
would
it
not
hurt
you
a
little
to
feel
that
you
had
sent
me
to
a
sort
of
living
death
from
which
i
could
never
come
back
to
life
that
i
was
imprisoned
for
ever
among
people
who
looked
down
upon
me
and
only
tolerated
me
for
my
fortune
sake
yet
that
would
be
the
very
least
part
of
it
all
i
could
bear
all
that
if
it
were
for
any
good
but
to
become
the
creature
the
possession
the
plaything
of
a
man
i
do
not
love
when
i
love
another
with
all
my
heart
oh
no
no
no
you
can
not
ask
me
that
his
anger
had
slowly
subsided
and
he
was
listening
now
not
because
she
had
him
in
her
power
but
because
what
she
said
was
true
for
he
was
a
just
and
honourable
man
i
wish
that
you
might
have
loved
any
man
but
zorzi
he
said
almost
as
if
speaking
to
himself
and
why
another
she
asked
following
up
her
advantage
instantly
you
would
have
had
me
marry
a
trevisan
perhaps
or
the
son
of
any
of
the
other
great
is
there
one
of
them
who
can
compare
with
zorzi
as
an
artist
let
alone
as
a
man
look
at
those
things
he
has
made
there
on
the
table
is
there
a
man
living
who
could
make
one
of
them
not
you
yourself
you
know
it
better
than
i
do
no
answered
beroviero
that
is
true
nor
is
there
any
one
who
could
make
the
glass
he
used
for
them
without
the
secrets
that
are
in
the
book
and
more
too
for
it
is
better
than
my
own
marietta
looked
at
him
in
surprise
this
was
something
she
had
not
known
is
it
not
your
glass
she
asked
it
is
better
he
must
have
added
something
to
the
composition
set
down
in
the
book
you
believe
that
although
the
book
itself
is
safe
he
has
made
use
of
it
yes
i
can
not
see
how
it
could
be
otherwise
was
the
book
sealed
yes
and
looked
in
an
iron
box
here
is
the
key
i
always
wear
it
he
drew
out
the
small
iron
key
and
showed
it
to
her
if
you
find
the
box
locked
and
the
seals
untouched
will
you
believe
that
zorzi
has
not
opened
the
manuscript
asked
marietta
yes
answered
beroviero
after
a
moment
thought
i
showed
him
the
seal
and
i
remember
that
he
said
a
man
might
make
one
like
it
but
i
should
know
by
the
wax
i
am
sure
i
could
tell
whether
it
had
been
tampered
with
yes
i
should
believe
he
had
not
opened
the
book
if
i
found
it
as
i
left
it
then
you
will
be
convinced
that
zorzi
is
altogether
innocent
of
all
the
charges
giovanni
made
against
him
is
that
true
yes
if
he
has
learnt
the
art
in
spite
of
the
law
that
is
my
fault
not
his
he
was
unwise
in
selling
the
beaker
to
giovanni
but
what
is
that
after
all
promise
me
then
said
marietta
laying
her
hand
upon
her
father
arm
promise
me
that
if
zorzi
comes
back
he
shall
be
safe
and
that
you
will
trust
him
as
you
always
have
though
he
dares
to
be
in
love
with
you
though
i
dare
to
love
him
or
apart
from
that
say
that
if
it
were
not
for
that
you
would
treat
him
just
as
before
you
went
away
yes
i
would
answered
beroviero
thoughtfully
the
book
is
there
said
marietta
she
pointed
to
the
big
earthen
jar
that
contained
the
broken
glass
and
her
father
eyes
followed
her
land
it
is
for
zorzi
sake
that
i
tell
you
she
continued
the
book
is
buried
deep
down
amongst
the
broken
bits
it
will
take
a
long
time
to
get
it
out
shall
i
call
pasquale
to
help
us
no
answered
her
father
he
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
brought
back
the
crowbar
then
he
placed
himself
in
a
good
position
for
striking
and
raised
the
iron
high
in
air
with
both
his
hands
stand
back
he
cried
as
marietta
came
nearer
the
first
blow
knocked
a
large
piece
of
earthenware
from
the
side
of
the
strong
jar
and
a
quantity
of
broken
red
glass
poured
out
as
red
as
blood
from
a
wound
and
fell
with
little
crashes
upon
the
stone
floor
beroviero
raised
the
crowbar
again
and
again
and
brought
it
down
with
all
his
might
at
the
fourth
stroke
the
whole
jar
went
to
pieces
leaving
nothing
but
a
red
heap
of
smashed
glass
round
about
which
lay
the
big
fragments
of
the
jar
in
the
middle
of
the
heap
the
corner
of
the
iron
box
appeared
sticking
up
like
a
black
stone
at
last
exclaimed
the
old
man
flushed
with
satisfaction
giovanni
had
not
thought
of
this
he
cleared
away
the
shivers
and
gently
pushed
the
box
out
of
its
bed
with
the
crowbar
he
soon
got
it
out
on
the
floor
and
with
some
precaution
lest
any
stray
splinter
should
cut
his
fingers
he
set
it
upon
the
table
then
he
took
the
key
from
his
neck
and
opened
it
marietta
belief
in
zorzi
had
never
wavered
from
the
first
but
beroviero
was
more
than
half
sure
that
the
book
had
been
opened
he
took
it
up
with
care
turned
it
over
and
over
in
his
hands
scrutinised
the
seal
the
strings
the
knots
and
saw
that
they
were
all
his
own
it
is
impossible
that
this
should
have
been
undone
and
tied
up
again
he
said
confidently
any
one
could
see
that
at
once
marietta
answered
do
you
believe
that
zorzi
is
innocent
i
can
not
help
believing
but
i
do
not
understand
there
is
the
red
glass
made
by
dropping
the
piece
of
copper
into
it
that
is
in
the
book
i
am
sure
it
was
an
accident
said
marietta
the
copper
ladle
fell
into
the
glass
zorzi
told
me
about
it
are
you
sure
that
is
possible
the
very
same
thing
happened
to
paolo
godi
and
that
was
how
he
discovered
the
colour
but
there
is
the
white
glass
which
is
so
like
mine
though
it
is
better
that
may
have
been
an
accident
too
or
the
boy
may
have
tried
an
experiment
upon
mine
by
adding
something
to
it
it
is
at
least
sure
that
the
book
has
not
been
touched
and
that
is
the
main
thing
you
admit
that
he
is
quite
innocent
do
you
not
quite
quite
innocent
yes
i
do
it
would
be
very
unjust
not
to
admit
it
marietta
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
for
she
had
scarcely
hoped
to
accomplish
so
much
in
so
short
a
time
the
rest
would
follow
she
felt
sure
i
would
give
a
great
deal
to
see
zorzi
at
once
said
her
father
at
last
as
he
replaced
the
manuscript
in
the
box
and
shut
the
lid
not
half
as
much
as
i
would
marietta
almost
laughed
as
she
spoke
father
she
added
gently
and
resting
one
hand
upon
his
shoulder
i
have
given
you
back
your
book
i
have
given
you
back
the
innocent
man
you
trusted
instead
of
the
villain
invented
by
my
brother
what
will
you
give
me
she
smiled
and
rubbed
her
cheek
against
his
shoulder
he
shook
his
head
a
little
and
would
not
answer
would
it
be
so
hard
to
say
that
you
ask
another
year
time
before
the
marriage
and
then
you
know
you
could
ask
it
again
and
they
would
soon
be
tired
of
waiting
and
would
break
it
off
themselves
do
not
suggest
such
woman
tricks
to
me
answered
her
father
but
he
could
not
help
smiling
oh
you
may
find
a
better
way
marietta
said
but
that
would
be
so
easy
would
it
not
your
daughter
is
so
young
her
health
is
somewhat
delicate
she
was
interrupted
by
a
knock
at
the
door
and
pasquale
entered
the
signor
giovanni
is
without
sir
said
the
porter
he
desires
to
take
leave
of
you
as
he
is
returning
to
his
own
house
let
him
come
in
said
beroviero
his
face
darkening
all
at
once
chapter
xxi
giovanni
entered
the
laboratory
confidently
not
even
knowing
that
marietta
was
with
her
father
and
not
suspecting
that
he
could
have
anything
to
fear
from
her
i
have
come
to
take
my
leave
of
you
sir
he
began
going
towards
his
father
at
once
he
did
not
see
the
broken
jar
which
was
at
some
distance
from
the
door
before
you
go
said
beroviero
coldly
pray
look
at
this
giovanni
saw
the
box
on
the
table
but
did
not
understand
as
he
had
never
seen
it
before
his
father
again
took
the
key
from
his
neck
and
opened
the
casket
this
is
paolo
godi
manuscript
he
said
without
changing
his
tone
you
see
here
is
the
book
the
seal
is
unbroken
it
is
exactly
as
i
left
it
when
zorzi
and
i
buried
it
together
you
suspected
him
of
having
opened
it
and
i
confess
that
you
made
me
suspect
him
too
for
the
sake
of
justice
convince
yourself
giovanni
face
was
drawn
with
lines
of
vexation
and
anxiety
it
was
hidden
in
the
jar
of
broken
glass
beroviero
explained
you
did
not
think
of
looking
there
no
nor
you
sir
i
mean
that
you
did
not
look
there
when
you
searched
for
it
alone
immediately
after
zorzi
was
arrested
giovanni
was
pale
now
but
he
raised
both
hands
and
turned
up
his
eyes
as
if
calling
upon
heaven
to
witness
his
innocence
i
swear
to
you
he
began
on
the
body
of
the
blessed
saint
donatus
beroviero
interrupted
him
i
did
not
ask
you
to
swear
by
anything
he
said
i
know
the
truth
the
less
you
say
of
what
has
happened
the
better
it
will
be
for
you
in
the
end
i
suppose
my
sister
has
been
poisoning
your
mind
against
me
as
usual
can
she
explain
how
her
mantle
came
here
it
does
not
concern
you
to
know
how
it
came
here
answered
beroviero
by
your
wholly
unjustifiable
haste
to
say
nothing
worse
you
have
caused
an
innocent
man
to
be
arrested
and
his
rescue
and
disappearance
have
made
matters
much
worse
i
do
not
care
to
ask
what
your
object
has
been
keep
it
to
yourself
pray
and
do
not
remind
me
of
this
affair
when
we
meet
for
after
all
you
are
my
son
you
came
to
take
your
leave
i
think
go
home
then
by
all
means
without
a
word
giovanni
went
out
biting
his
thin
lip
and
reflecting
mournfully
upon
the
change
in
his
position
since
he
had
talked
with
his
father
in
the
morning
while
they
had
been
speaking
marietta
had
gone
to
a
little
distance
affecting
to
unfold
the
mantle
and
fold
it
again
according
to
feminine
rules
as
she
heard
the
door
shut
again
she
glanced
at
her
father
face
and
saw
that
he
was
looking
at
her
i
told
you
that
i
was
learning
patience
he
said
i
longed
to
lay
my
hands
on
him
you
frightened
him
much
more
by
what
you
said
answered
marietta
perhaps
never
mind
he
is
gone
the
question
is
how
to
find
zorzi
that
is
the
first
thing
and
then
we
must
undo
the
mischief
giovanni
has
done
i
think
pasquale
must
have
some
clue
by
which
we
may
find
zorzi
suggested
marietta
pasquale
was
called
at
once
he
stood
with
his
legs
bowed
holding
his
old
cap
in
both
hands
his
small
bloodshot
eyes
fixed
on
his
face
with
a
look
of
inquiry
he
was
more
than
ever
like
a
savage
old
yes
sir
he
said
in
answer
to
beroviero
question
i
can
tell
you
something
two
men
were
looking
on
last
night
when
the
signor
giovanni
made
me
open
the
door
to
the
governor
soldiers
they
wore
hoods
over
their
eyes
but
i
am
certain
that
one
of
them
was
that
greek
captain
who
came
here
one
morning
before
you
went
away
when
zorzi
came
out
the
greek
walked
off
up
the
footway
and
past
the
bridge
the
other
waited
till
they
were
all
gone
and
till
signor
giovanni
had
come
in
he
whispered
quickly
in
my
ear
is
safe
then
he
went
after
the
others
i
could
see
that
he
had
a
short
staff
hidden
under
his
cloak
and
that
he
was
a
man
with
bones
like
an
ox
but
he
was
not
so
big
a
man
as
the
captain
then
i
knew
that
two
such
men
who
were
seamen
accustomed
to
using
their
hands
quick
on
their
feet
and
seeing
well
in
the
dark
as
we
all
do
could
pitch
the
officer
over
the
tower
of
san
piero
if
they
chose
with
all
his
sleazy
crew
of
lubberly
boobies
armed
with
overgrown
this
i
thought
and
so
it
happened
that
is
what
i
know
but
why
should
captain
aristarchi
care
whether
zorzi
were
arrested
or
not
asked
beroviero
this
the
saints
may
know
in
paradise
answered
pasquale
but
not
i
has
the
captain
been
here
again
asked
beroviero
completely
puzzled
no
sir
but
i
should
have
told
you
that
one
morning
there
came
a
patrician
of
venice
messer
zuan
venier
who
wished
to
see
you
being
a
friend
of
messer
jacopo
contarini
and
when
he
heard
that
you
were
away
he
desired
to
see
zorzi
and
stayed
some
time
i
know
him
by
name
said
beroviero
nodding
but
there
can
be
no
connection
between
him
and
this
greek
pasquale
snarled
and
showed
his
teeth
at
the
mere
idea
for
his
instinct
told
him
that
aristarchi
was
a
pirate
or
had
been
one
and
he
was
by
no
means
sure
that
the
greek
had
carried
off
zorzi
for
any
good
purpose
pasquale
said
beroviero
it
is
long
since
you
have
had
a
holiday
take
the
skiff
morning
and
go
over
to
venice
you
are
a
seaman
and
you
can
easily
find
out
from
the
sailors
about
the
giudecca
who
this
aristarchi
really
is
and
where
he
lives
then
try
to
see
him
and
tell
him
that
zorzi
is
innocent
of
all
the
charges
against
him
and
that
if
he
will
come
back
i
will
protect
him
can
you
do
that
pasquale
gave
signs
of
great
satisfaction
by
growling
and
grinning
at
the
same
time
and
his
lids
drew
themselves
into
a
hundred
wrinkles
till
his
eyes
seemed
no
bigger
than
two
red
murano
beads
then
beroviero
and
marietta
went
back
to
the
house
and
the
young
girl
carried
the
folded
mantle
under
her
cloak
before
going
to
her
own
room
she
opened
it
out
as
if
it
had
been
worn
and
dropped
it
behind
a
in
the
large
room
as
if
it
had
fallen
from
her
shoulders
while
she
had
been
sitting
there
and
in
due
time
it
was
found
by
one
of
the
who
brought
it
back
to
nella
you
are
so
careless
my
pretty
lady
cried
the
holding
up
her
hands
yes
answered
marietta
i
know
it
so
careless
repeated
nella
nothing
has
any
value
for
you
some
day
you
will
forget
your
face
in
the
mirror
and
go
away
without
it
and
then
they
will
say
it
is
nella
fault
marietta
laughed
lightly
for
she
was
happy
it
was
clear
that
everything
was
to
end
well
though
it
might
be
long
before
her
father
would
consent
to
let
her
marry
zorzi
she
felt
quite
sure
that
he
was
safe
though
he
might
lie
far
away
by
this
time
beroviero
returned
at
once
to
the
governor
house
and
did
his
best
to
undo
the
mischief
but
to
his
unspeakable
disappointment
he
found
that
the
governor
report
had
already
gone
to
the
council
of
ten
so
that
the
matter
had
passed
altogether
out
of
his
hands
the
council
would
certainly
find
zorzi
if
he
were
in
venice
and
within
two
or
three
days
at
the
utmost
if
not
within
a
few
hours
for
the
signors
of
the
night
were
very
vigilant
and
their
men
knew
every
in
venice
zorzi
said
the
governor
would
certainly
be
taken
into
custody
unless
he
had
escaped
to
the
mainland
beroviero
could
have
wrung
his
hands
for
sheer
despair
and
when
he
told
marietta
the
result
of
his
second
visit
to
the
governor
her
heart
sank
for
zorzi
danger
was
greater
than
ever
before
and
it
was
not
likely
that
a
man
who
had
been
so
mysteriously
rescued
to
the
manifest
injury
and
disgrace
of
those
who
were
taking
him
to
prison
could
escape
torture
he
would
certainly
be
suspected
of
connivance
with
secret
enemies
of
the
republic
beroviero
bethought
him
of
the
friends
he
had
in
venice
to
whom
he
might
apply
for
help
in
his
difficulty
in
the
first
place
there
was
messer
luigi
foscarini
a
procurator
of
saint
mark
but
he
had
not
been
long
in
office
and
he
would
probably
not
wish
to
be
concerned
in
any
matter
which
tended
to
oppose
authority
and
there
was
old
contarini
who
was
himself
one
of
the
ten
beroviero
knew
his
character
well
and
judged
that
he
would
not
be
lenient
towards
any
one
who
had
been
forcibly
rescued
no
matter
how
innocent
he
might
be
moreover
the
law
against
foreigners
who
attempted
to
work
in
glass
was
in
force
and
very
stringent
contarini
like
many
men
who
have
no
control
whatever
over
their
own
children
was
always
for
excessive
severity
in
all
processes
of
the
law
beroviero
thought
of
some
others
but
against
each
one
he
found
some
real
objection
sitting
in
his
chair
after
supper
he
talked
earnestly
of
the
matter
with
marietta
who
sat
opposite
him
with
her
work
by
the
large
brass
lamp
for
the
present
he
had
almost
forgotten
the
question
of
her
marriage
for
all
his
former
affection
for
zorzi
had
returned
with
the
conviction
of
his
innocence
and
the
case
was
very
urgent
that
very
night
zorzi
might
be
found
and
on
the
next
morning
he
might
be
brought
before
the
ten
to
be
examined
marietta
thought
with
terror
of
the
awful
tales
nella
had
told
her
about
the
little
torture
chamber
behind
the
hall
of
the
council
who
is
that
messer
zuan
venier
who
came
to
see
zorzi
asked
marietta
suddenly
a
young
man
who
fought
very
bravely
in
the
east
i
believe
answered
beroviero
his
father
was
the
admiral
of
the
republic
for
some
time
he
has
talked
with
zorzi
said
marietta
pasquale
said
so
he
must
have
liked
him
of
course
and
none
of
the
other
patricians
you
have
mentioned
have
ever
seen
him
messer
zuan
is
not
in
office
and
has
nothing
to
lose
perhaps
he
will
be
willing
to
use
his
influence
with
his
father
if
only
the
ten
could
know
the
whole
truth
before
zorzi
is
brought
before
them
it
would
be
very
different
beroviero
saw
that
there
was
some
wisdom
in
applying
to
a
younger
man
like
zuan
venier
who
had
nothing
at
stake
and
since
venier
had
come
to
visit
him
there
could
be
nothing
strange
in
his
returning
the
courtesy
as
soon
as
he
conveniently
could
on
the
following
morning
therefore
the
master
betook
himself
to
venice
in
his
gondola
pasquale
was
already
gone
in
the
skiff
on
the
errand
entrusted
to
him
he
had
judged
it
best
not
to
put
on
his
sunday
clothes
nor
his
clean
shirt
nor
to
waste
time
in
improving
his
appearance
at
the
barber
for
he
had
been
shaved
on
saturday
night
as
usual
and
the
week
was
not
yet
half
over
hidden
in
the
bow
of
the
little
boat
there
lay
his
provision
for
the
day
half
a
loaf
of
bread
a
thick
slice
of
cheese
and
two
onions
with
an
earthen
bottle
of
water
with
these
supplies
the
old
sailor
knew
that
he
could
roam
the
canals
of
venice
for
hours
if
he
chose
and
he
also
had
some
money
in
case
it
should
seem
wise
to
ply
an
acquaintance
with
a
little
strong
wine
in
order
to
promote
conversation
the
morning
was
sultry
and
a
light
haze
hung
over
the
islands
at
sunrise
which
is
by
no
means
usual
pasquale
sniffed
the
air
as
he
rowed
himself
through
the
narrow
canals
there
was
a
mingled
smell
of
stagnant
salt
water
cabbage
stalks
and
wood
smoke
long
unfamiliar
to
him
and
reminding
him
pleasantly
of
his
childhood
wherever
a
bit
of
stone
pier
ran
along
by
an
open
space
scores
of
boys
were
bathing
and
as
he
passed
they
yelled
at
him
and
splashed
him
many
a
time
he
had
done
the
same
long
ago
and
had
sometimes
got
a
sharp
knock
from
the
blade
of
an
oar
for
his
pains
the
high
walls
made
brown
shadows
that
struck
across
the
greenish
water
shivering
away
to
long
streaks
of
broken
light
and
shade
and
trying
to
dance
and
rock
themselves
together
for
a
moment
before
a
passing
boat
disturbed
them
again
in
the
shade
boats
were
moored
laden
with
fresh
vegetables
and
with
jars
of
milk
brought
in
from
the
islands
and
the
mainland
before
dawn
from
open
windows
here
and
there
women
with
dark
eyes
looked
down
idly
and
breathed
the
morning
air
for
a
few
minutes
before
beginning
their
household
work
the
bells
of
saint
john
and
saint
paul
were
ringing
to
low
mass
and
a
few
old
women
with
black
shawls
over
their
heads
and
wooden
clogs
on
their
feet
made
a
faint
clattering
as
they
straggled
to
the
door
it
was
long
since
pasquale
had
been
in
venice
he
could
not
remember
exactly
how
many
years
had
passed
but
the
city
had
changed
little
and
still
after
many
centuries
there
is
but
little
and
slow
change
the
ways
and
turnings
were
as
familiar
to
him
as
ever
and
would
have
been
unforgotten
if
he
had
never
taken
the
trouble
to
cross
the
lagoon
again
to
his
dying
day
the
soft
sounds
the
violent
colours
the
splendid
gloom
of
halls
that
went
straight
from
the
great
open
door
at
the
water
edge
to
the
shadowy
heart
of
the
palace
within
the
boatmen
polishing
the
metal
work
of
their
gondolas
with
brick
dust
and
olive
oil
the
servants
still
in
rough
working
clothes
sweeping
the
steps
and
trimming
off
the
charred
of
torches
that
had
been
used
in
the
night
the
single
woman
voice
far
overhead
that
broke
the
silence
of
some
narrow
way
singing
its
song
for
sheer
gladness
of
an
idle
heart
it
was
all
as
it
used
to
be
and
pasquale
had
a
dim
consciousness
that
he
loved
it
better
than
his
dreary
little
den
in
murano
and
better
than
his
sunday
walk
as
far
as
san
donato
when
all
the
handsome
women
and
pretty
girls
of
the
smaller
people
were
laughing
away
the
cool
hours
and
showing
off
their
little
fineries
it
was
but
a
vague
suggestion
of
a
sentiment
with
him
and
no
more
he
knew
that
he
should
starve
if
he
came
back
to
venice
and
what
was
the
pleasant
smell
of
the
cabbage
stalks
and
that
it
should
compare
with
the
security
of
daily
bread
and
lodging
with
some
money
to
spare
and
two
suits
of
clothes
every
year
which
his
master
gave
him
in
return
for
keeping
a
single
door
shut
he
pushed
out
upon
the
grand
canal
where
as
yet
there
were
few
boats
and
no
gondolas
at
all
and
soon
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
salute
and
rowed
out
slowly
upon
the
giudecca
where
the
merchant
vessels
lay
at
anchor
large
and
small
galliots
and
feluccas
and
many
a
broad
from
the
istrian
coast
with
huge
spreading
bows
and
hawse
ports
painted
scarlet
like
great
red
eyes
the
old
sailor
heart
was
gladdened
by
the
sight
of
them
and
as
he
rested
on
his
single
oar
he
gently
cursed
the
land
and
all
landlocked
places
and
rivers
and
fresh
water
and
all
lakes
and
inland
canals
and
wished
himself
once
more
on
the
high
seas
with
a
stout
vessel
a
lazy
captain
a
dozen
shipmates
and
a
quarter
of
a
century
less
to
his
account
of
years
he
had
been
dreaming
a
little
and
now
he
bent
to
the
oar
again
and
sent
the
skiff
quietly
along
by
the
pier
looking
out
for
any
idle
seamen
who
might
be
led
into
conversation
before
long
he
spied
a
couple
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
stones
near
some
steps
and
fishing
with
long
canes
he
passed
them
of
course
without
looking
at
them
lest
they
should
suspect
that
he
had
come
their
way
purposely
and
he
made
the
skiff
fast
by
the
stair
after
which
he
sat
down
on
a
thwart
and
stared
vacantly
at
things
in
general
being
careful
not
to
bestow
a
glance
on
the
two
men
presently
one
of
them
caught
a
small
fish
and
pasquale
judged
that
the
moment
for
scraping
an
acquaintance
had
begun
he
turned
his
head
and
watched
how
the
man
unhooked
the
fish
and
dropped
it
flapping
into
a
basket
made
of
rushes
there
are
no
whales
in
the
canal
he
observed
there
are
not
even
tunny
fish
but
what
there
is
it
seems
that
you
know
how
to
catch
i
do
what
i
can
according
to
my
little
skill
answered
the
man
it
passes
the
time
and
then
it
is
always
something
to
eat
with
the
bread
yes
pasquale
answered
a
roasted
fish
on
bread
with
a
little
oil
is
very
savoury
as
for
passing
the
time
i
suppose
that
you
are
looking
for
a
ship
of
course
the
man
replied
if
we
had
a
ship
we
should
not
be
here
fishing
it
is
a
bad
time
of
the
year
you
must
know
for
most
of
the
venetian
vessels
are
at
sea
and
we
do
not
care
to
ship
with
any
neapolitan
captain
who
chances
to
have
starved
some
of
his
crew
to
death
i
have
heard
of
a
rich
greek
merchant
captain
who
has
been
in
venice
some
time
observed
pasquale
carelessly
he
will
be
looking
out
for
a
crew
before
long
is
captain
aristarchi
going
to
sea
at
last
asked
the
man
who
had
not
spoken
yet
or
do
you
mean
some
other
captain
that
is
the
name
i
believe
said
pasquale
it
was
an
outlandish
name
like
that
do
you
ever
see
him
about
the
docks
i
saw
him
once
a
piece
of
man
i
tell
you
with
bones
like
a
bull
and
a
face
like
a
bear
he
is
not
often
seen
answered
the
man
who
had
spoken
last
that
is
his
ship
over
there
between
the
and
the
dismasted
hulk
i
see
her
returned
pasquale
at
once
a
thorough
greek
she
is
too
by
her
looks
but
well
kept
enough
if
she
is
only
waiting
for
a
cargo
with
two
or
three
hands
on
board
the
men
laughed
a
little
at
pasquale
ignorance
concerning
the
vessel
she
has
a
full
crew
said
one
she
is
always
ready
for
sea
at
any
moment
with
provisions
and
water
no
one
can
understand
what
the
captain
means
nor
why
he
is
here
nor
why
he
is
willing
to
pay
twenty
men
for
doing
nothing
does
the
captain
live
on
board
of
her
inquired
pasquale
indifferently
not
he
he
is
amusing
himself
in
venice
he
has
hired
a
house
by
the
month
not
far
from
the
baker
bridge
and
there
he
has
been
living
for
a
long
time
he
must
be
very
rich
observed
pasquale
who
had
found
out
what
he
wished
to
know
but
was
too
wise
to
let
the
conversation
drop
too
abruptly
from
what
you
say
however
he
needs
no
more
hands
on
his
vessel
he
added
it
is
not
for
us
answered
the
man
we
will
ship
with
a
captain
we
know
and
with
shipmates
from
our
own
country
who
are
christians
and
understand
the
compass
this
he
said
because
all
vessels
did
not
carry
a
compass
in
those
days
and
until
we
can
pick
up
a
ship
we
like
added
the
other
man
we
will
live
on
bread
and
water
and
if
we
can
catch
a
fish
now
and
then
in
the
canal
so
much
the
better
pasquale
cast
off
the
bit
of
line
that
moored
his
skiff
shipped
his
single
oar
and
with
a
parting
word
to
the
men
he
pushed
off
you
are
quite
right
he
said
eh
a
roast
fish
is
a
savoury
thing
they
nodded
to
him
and
again
became
intent
on
their
pastime
pasquale
rowed
faster
than
before
and
he
passed
close
under
the
stern
of
the
greek
vessel
the
mate
was
leaning
over
the
taffrail
under
the
poop
awning
he
was
dressed
in
baggy
garments
of
spotless
white
his
big
blue
cap
was
stuck
far
back
on
his
head
and
his
strong
brown
arms
were
bare
to
the
elbow
he
looked
as
broad
as
he
was
long
is
the
captain
on
board
sir
asked
pasquale
at
a
venture
but
looking
at
the
mate
with
interest
he
expected
that
he
would
answer
the
question
in
the
negative
by
sticking
out
his
jaw
and
throwing
his
head
a
little
backward
to
his
surprise
the
mate
returned
his
gaze
a
moment
and
then
stood
upright
keep
under
the
counter
he
said
in
fairly
good
italian
i
will
go
and
see
if
the
captain
is
in
his
cabin
pasquale
waited
and
in
a
few
moments
the
mate
returned
dropped
a
jacob
ladder
over
the
taffrail
and
made
it
fast
on
board
pasquale
hitched
the
painter
of
the
skiff
to
the
end
that
hung
down
and
went
up
easily
enough
in
spite
of
his
age
and
stiffened
joints
he
climbed
over
the
rail
and
stood
beside
the
mate
the
instant
his
feet
touched
the
white
deck
he
wished
he
had
put
on
his
sunday
hose
and
his
clean
shirt
he
touched
his
cap
as
he
assuredly
would
not
have
done
ashore
to
any
one
but
his
master
you
seem
to
have
been
a
sailor
said
the
greek
mate
in
an
approving
tone
yes
sir
answered
pasquale
is
zorzi
still
safe
the
captain
will
tell
you
about
zorzi
was
the
mate
answer
as
he
led
the
way
aristarchi
was
seated
with
one
leg
under
him
on
a
inroad
transom
over
which
was
spread
a
priceless
persian
silk
carpet
such
as
the
richest
patrician
in
venice
would
have
hung
on
the
wall
like
a
tapestry
of
great
value
he
looked
at
pasquale
and
the
latter
heard
the
door
shut
behind
him
at
the
same
instant
a
voice
greeted
him
by
name
as
zorzi
himself
appeared
from
the
inner
cabin
i
did
not
expect
to
find
you
so
soon
said
the
porter
with
a
growl
of
satisfaction
i
wish
you
had
found
him
sooner
laughed
aristarchi
carelessly
and
since
you
are
here
i
hope
you
will
carry
him
off
with
you
and
never
let
me
see
his
face
again
till
all
this
disturbance
is
over
i
would
rather
have
carried
off
the
doge
himself
with
his
precious
velvet
on
his
head
than
have
taken
this
fellow
the
other
night
all
venice
is
after
him
i
was
just
going
to
drown
him
to
get
rid
of
him
there
was
a
sort
of
savage
in
the
greek
tone
which
was
reassuring
in
spite
of
his
ferocious
looks
and
words
you
would
have
been
hanged
if
you
had
observed
pasquale
in
answer
to
the
last
words
zorzi
was
evidently
none
the
worse
for
what
had
happened
to
him
since
his
arrest
and
unexpected
liberation
he
was
not
of
the
sort
that
suffer
by
the
imagination
when
there
is
real
danger
for
he
had
plenty
of
good
sense
pasquale
told
him
that
the
master
had
returned
we
knew
it
yesterday
zorzi
answered
the
captain
seems
to
know
everything
listen
to
me
friend
porter
aristarchi
said
if
you
will
take
this
young
fellow
with
you
i
shall
be
obliged
to
you
i
took
him
from
the
governor
men
out
of
mere
kindness
of
heart
because
i
liked
him
the
first
time
i
saw
him
but
the
ten
are
determined
to
get
him
into
their
hands
and
i
have
no
fancy
to
go
with
him
and
answer
for
the
crowns
my
mate
and
i
broke
in
that
frolic
at
murano
pasquale
small
eyes
twinkled
at
the
thought
of
the
discomfited
archers
we
have
changed
our
lodgings
three
times
since
yesterday
afternoon
continued
aristarchi
and
i
am
tired
of
carrying
this
lame
up
and
down
rope
ladders
when
the
signors
of
the
night
are
at
the
door
so
drop
him
over
the
rail
into
your
boat
and
let
me
lead
a
peaceful
life
like
an
honest
merchant
captain
as
you
are
added
pasquale
with
a
grin
we
have
been
anxious
for
you
he
added
looking
at
zorzi
the
master
is
in
venice
this
morning
to
see
his
friends
on
your
behalf
i
think
if
we
go
back
openly
said
zorzi
we
may
both
be
taken
at
any
moment
if
they
catch
me
answered
pasquale
they
will
heave
me
overboard
i
am
not
worth
salting
but
they
need
not
catch
either
of
us
once
in
the
laboratory
at
murano
they
will
never
find
you
that
is
the
one
place
where
they
will
not
look
for
you
the
mate
put
his
head
down
through
the
small
hatch
overhead
i
do
not
like
the
look
of
a
boat
that
has
just
put
off
from
saint
george
he
said
aristarchi
sprang
to
his
feet
pick
him
up
and
drop
him
into
the
porter
skiff
he
said
i
am
sick
of
dancing
with
the
fellow
in
my
arms
with
incredible
ease
aristarchi
took
zorzi
round
the
waist
mounted
the
cabin
table
and
passed
him
up
through
the
hatch
to
the
mate
who
had
already
brought
him
to
the
jacob
ladder
at
the
stern
before
pasquale
could
get
there
by
the
ordinary
way
quick
man
said
the
mate
as
the
old
sailor
climbed
over
the
rail
at
the
same
time
he
slipped
the
bight
of
short
rope
round
zorzi
body
under
his
arms
and
got
a
turn
round
the
rail
with
both
parts
so
as
to
lower
him
easily
zorzi
helped
himself
as
well
as
he
could
and
in
a
few
moments
he
was
lying
in
the
bottom
of
the
skiff
covered
with
a
piece
of
sacking
which
the
mate
threw
down
the
rope
ladder
was
hauled
up
and
disappeared
and
when
pasquale
glanced
back
as
he
rowed
slowly
away
the
mate
was
leaning
over
the
taffrail
in
an
attitude
of
easy
unconcern
the
old
porter
had
smuggled
more
than
one
bale
of
rich
goods
ashore
in
his
young
days
for
a
captain
who
had
a
dislike
of
the
customs
and
he
knew
that
his
chance
of
safety
lay
not
in
speed
but
in
showing
a
cool
indifference
he
might
have
dropped
down
the
giudecca
at
a
good
rate
for
the
tide
was
fair
but
he
preferred
a
direction
that
would
take
him
right
across
the
course
of
the
boat
which
the
mate
had
seen
coming
as
if
he
were
on
his
way
to
the
lido
the
officer
of
the
ten
with
four
men
in
plain
brown
coats
and
leathern
belts
sat
in
the
stern
of
the
launch
that
swept
swiftly
past
the
skiff
towards
the
vessels
at
anchor
pasquale
rested
on
his
oar
a
moment
and
turned
to
look
with
an
air
of
interest
that
would
have
disarmed
any
suspicions
the
officer
might
have
entertained
but
he
had
none
and
did
not
bestow
a
second
glance
on
the
little
craft
with
its
shabby
oarsman
then
pasquale
began
to
row
again
with
a
long
even
stroke
that
had
no
air
of
haste
about
it
but
which
kept
the
skiff
at
a
good
speed
when
he
saw
that
he
was
out
of
hearing
of
other
boats
and
heading
for
the
lido
he
began
to
tell
what
he
intended
to
do
next
in
a
low
monotonous
tone
glancing
down
now
and
then
at
zorzi
face
that
cautiously
peered
at
him
out
from
the
folds
of
the
sackcloth
i
will
tell
you
when
to
cover
yourself
he
said
speaking
at
the
horizon
we
shall
have
to
spend
the
day
under
one
of
the
islands
i
have
some
bread
and
cheese
and
water
and
there
are
onions
when
it
is
night
i
will
just
slip
into
our
canal
at
murano
and
you
can
sleep
in
the
laboratory
as
if
you
had
never
left
it
if
they
find
me
there
they
can
not
say
that
i
am
hiding
said
zorzi
with
a
low
laugh
lie
low
said
pasquale
softly
there
is
a
boat
coming
for
ten
minutes
neither
spoke
and
zorzi
lay
quite
still
covering
his
face
when
the
danger
was
past
pasquale
began
to
talk
again
and
told
him
all
he
himself
knew
of
what
had
happened
which
was
not
much
but
which
included
the
assurance
that
the
master
was
for
him
and
had
turned
against
giovanni
as
for
me
said
zorzi
by
and
by
when
they
were
moored
to
a
stake
far
out
in
the
lagoon
i
was
whirled
from
place
to
place
by
those
two
men
till
i
did
not
know
where
i
was
when
they
first
carried
me
off
they
made
me
lie
in
the
bottom
of
their
boat
as
i
am
lying
now
and
they
took
me
to
a
house
somewhere
near
the
baker
bridge
do
you
know
the
house
of
the
agnus
dei
pasquale
grunted
it
was
not
far
from
that
zorzi
continued
aristarchi
lives
there
the
mate
went
back
to
the
ship
i
suppose
and
aristarchi
servant
gave
us
supper
then
we
slept
quietly
till
morning
and
i
stayed
there
all
day
but
aristarchi
thought
it
would
not
be
safe
to
keep
me
in
his
house
the
next
night
that
was
last
night
he
said
he
feared
that
a
certain
lady
had
guessed
where
i
was
he
is
a
mysterious
individual
this
greek
so
i
was
taken
somewhere
else
in
the
bottom
of
a
boat
after
dark
i
do
not
know
where
it
was
but
i
think
it
must
have
been
the
garret
of
some
tavern
where
they
play
dice
after
midnight
i
heard
a
great
commotion
below
me
and
presently
aristarchi
appeared
at
the
window
with
a
rope
he
always
seems
to
have
a
coil
of
rope
within
reach
he
tied
me
to
him
it
was
like
being
tied
to
a
wild
horse
and
he
got
us
safely
down
from
the
window
to
the
boat
again
and
the
mate
was
in
it
and
they
took
me
to
the
ship
faster
than
i
was
ever
rowed
in
my
life
you
know
the
rest
all
through
the
long
july
day
they
lay
in
the
fierce
sun
shading
themselves
with
the
sacking
as
best
they
could
but
when
it
was
dark
at
last
pasquale
cast
off
and
headed
the
skiff
for
murano
chapter
xxii
jacopo
contarini
luck
at
dice
had
changed
of
late
and
his
friends
no
longer
spoke
of
losing
like
him
but
of
winning
as
he
did
on
almost
every
throw
nevertheless
said
the
big
foscari
to
zuan
venier
his
love
affairs
seem
to
prosper
the
georgian
is
as
beautiful
as
ever
and
he
is
going
to
marry
a
rich
wife
it
was
the
afternoon
of
the
day
on
which
zorzi
had
left
ship
and
the
two
patricians
were
lounging
in
the
shady
merceria
where
the
overhanging
balconies
of
the
wooden
houses
almost
met
above
and
the
merchants
sat
below
in
the
windows
of
their
deep
shops
on
the
little
platforms
which
were
at
once
counters
and
the
street
smelt
of
eastern
silks
and
spanish
leather
and
of
the
egyptian
pastils
which
the
merchants
of
perfumery
continually
burnt
in
order
to
attract
custom
i
am
not
qualmish
answered
venier
languidly
yet
it
sickens
me
to
think
of
the
life
jacopo
means
to
lead
i
am
sorry
for
the
daughter
foscari
laughed
carelessly
the
idea
that
a
woman
should
be
looked
upon
as
anything
more
than
a
slave
or
an
object
of
prey
had
never
occurred
to
him
but
venier
did
not
smile
since
we
speak
of
he
said
jacopo
is
doing
his
best
to
get
that
unlucky
dalmatian
imprisoned
and
banished
old
beroviero
came
to
see
me
this
morning
and
told
me
a
long
story
about
it
which
i
can
not
possibly
remember
but
it
seems
to
me
you
understand
he
spoke
in
low
tones
for
the
merceria
was
crowded
foscari
who
was
one
of
those
who
took
most
seriously
the
ceremonial
of
the
secret
society
while
not
caring
a
straw
for
its
political
side
looked
very
grave
it
is
of
no
use
to
say
that
the
poor
fellow
is
only
a
venier
continued
there
are
men
besides
patricians
in
the
world
and
good
men
too
i
mean
to
tell
contarini
what
i
think
of
it
i
will
too
said
foscari
at
once
and
i
intend
to
use
all
the
influence
my
family
has
to
obtain
a
fair
hearing
for
the
dalmatian
i
hope
you
will
help
me
amongst
us
we
can
reach
every
one
of
the
council
of
ten
except
old
contarini
who
has
the
soul
of
a
and
the
intelligence
of
a
crab
if
i
did
not
like
the
fellow
i
suppose
i
should
let
him
be
hanged
several
times
rather
than
take
so
much
trouble
sins
of
omission
are
my
strongest
point
i
have
always
surprised
my
confessor
at
easter
by
the
extraordinary
number
of
things
i
have
left
undone
i
daresay
laughed
foscari
but
i
remember
that
you
were
not
too
lazy
to
save
me
from
drowning
when
i
fell
into
the
grand
canal
in
carnival
i
forgot
that
the
water
was
so
cold
said
venier
if
i
had
guessed
how
chilly
it
was
i
should
certainly
not
have
pulled
you
out
there
is
old
hossein
at
his
window
let
us
go
in
and
drink
sherbet
we
shall
find
mocenigo
and
loredan
there
answered
foscari
they
shall
promise
to
help
the
too
they
nodded
to
the
persian
merchant
who
saluted
them
by
extending
his
hand
towards
the
ground
as
if
to
take
up
dust
and
then
bringing
it
to
his
forehead
he
was
very
fat
and
his
face
might
have
been
carved
out
of
white
cheese
the
two
young
men
went
in
by
a
small
door
at
the
side
of
the
and
disappeared
into
the
interior
at
the
back
of
the
shop
there
was
a
private
room
with
a
latticed
window
that
looked
out
upon
a
narrow
canal
it
was
one
of
many
places
where
the
young
venetians
met
in
the
afternoon
to
play
at
dice
undisturbed
on
pretence
of
examining
hossein
splendid
carpets
and
oriental
silks
moreover
hossein
wife
always
invisible
but
ever
near
had
a
marvellous
gift
for
making
fruit
sherbets
cooled
with
the
snow
that
was
brought
down
daily
from
the
mountains
on
the
mainland
in
dripping
bales
covered
with
straw
matting
loredan
and
mocenigo
were
already
there
as
foscari
had
anticipated
eating
pistachio
nuts
and
sipping
sherbet
through
rice
straws
out
of
tall
glasses
from
murano
it
was
a
very
safe
place
for
knowledge
of
the
italian
language
was
of
a
purely
commercial
character
embracing
every
numeral
and
fraction
common
or
uncommon
and
the
names
of
all
the
hundreds
of
foreign
coins
that
passed
current
in
venice
together
with
necessary
phrases
and
his
invisible
but
occasionally
audible
wife
understood
no
italian
at
all
also
hossein
was
always
willing
to
lend
any
young
patrician
money
with
which
to
pay
his
losses
at
the
modest
rate
of
seven
ducats
to
be
paid
every
week
for
the
use
of
each
hundred
which
one
of
the
youths
who
had
a
turn
for
arithmetic
had
discovered
to
be
only
about
per
cent
yearly
whereas
casadio
the
hebrew
had
a
method
of
his
own
by
which
he
managed
to
get
about
it
was
therefore
a
real
economy
to
frequent
hossein
shop
in
spite
of
his
pretended
forgetfulness
venier
remembered
every
word
that
beroviero
had
told
him
and
indolently
as
he
talked
his
whole
nature
was
roused
to
defend
zorzi
in
his
heart
he
despised
contarini
and
hoped
that
his
marriage
might
never
take
place
for
he
was
sincerely
sorry
for
marietta
but
it
was
jacopo
behaviour
towards
zorzi
that
called
forth
his
wrath
it
was
the
man
disdainful
assumption
that
because
zorzi
was
not
a
patrician
the
oath
to
defend
every
companion
of
the
society
was
not
binding
where
he
was
concerned
it
was
the
insolent
certainty
that
the
others
should
all
be
glad
to
be
rid
of
the
poor
dalmatian
who
after
all
had
not
troubled
them
with
his
company
on
that
very
evening
they
were
to
meet
at
the
house
of
the
agnus
dei
and
venier
was
determined
to
speak
his
mind
when
he
chose
to
exert
himself
his
influence
over
his
companions
was
very
great
if
not
supreme
he
soon
brought
mocenigo
and
loredan
to
share
his
opinion
and
to
promise
the
support
of
all
their
many
relations
in
zorzi
favour
and
the
four
began
to
play
for
lack
of
anything
better
to
do
before
long
others
of
the
society
came
in
and
as
each
arrived
venier
who
only
played
in
order
not
to
seem
as
unsociable
as
he
generally
felt
set
down
the
dice
box
to
gain
over
a
new
ally
an
hour
had
passed
when
contarini
himself
appeared
even
more
magnificent
than
usual
his
beautiful
waving
beard
most
carefully
trimmed
and
combed
as
if
to
show
it
to
its
greatest
advantage
against
the
purple
silk
of
a
surcoat
cut
in
a
new
fashion
and
which
he
was
wearing
for
the
first
time
his
white
hands
were
splendid
with
jewelled
rings
and
he
wore
at
his
belt
a
large
embroidered
in
constantinople
before
the
coming
of
the
turks
and
adorned
with
three
enamelled
images
of
saints
hossein
himself
ushered
him
in
as
if
he
were
the
guest
of
honour
as
the
persian
merchant
indeed
considered
him
for
none
of
the
others
had
ever
paid
him
half
so
many
seven
weekly
ducats
for
money
borrowed
in
all
their
lives
as
jacopo
had
often
paid
in
a
single
year
there
are
men
whom
no
one
respects
very
highly
who
are
not
sincerely
trusted
whose
honour
is
not
spotless
and
whose
ways
are
far
from
straight
but
who
nevertheless
hold
a
certain
ascendancy
over
others
by
mere
show
and
assurance
when
contarini
entered
a
place
where
many
were
gathered
together
there
was
almost
always
a
little
hush
in
the
talk
followed
by
a
murmur
that
was
pleasant
in
his
ear
no
one
paused
to
look
at
zuan
venier
when
he
came
into
a
room
though
there
was
not
one
of
his
friends
who
would
not
have
gone
to
him
in
danger
or
difficulty
without
so
much
as
thinking
of
contarini
as
a
possible
helper
in
trouble
but
it
was
almost
impossible
not
to
feel
a
sort
of
artistic
surprise
at
jacopo
extraordinary
beauty
of
face
and
figure
if
not
at
the
splendid
garments
in
which
he
delighted
to
array
himself
it
was
with
a
slight
condescension
that
he
greeted
the
group
of
players
some
of
whom
at
once
made
a
place
for
him
at
the
table
they
had
been
ready
enough
to
stand
by
venier
against
him
in
zorzi
defence
but
unless
venier
led
the
way
there
was
not
one
of
them
who
would
think
of
opposing
him
or
taking
him
to
task
for
what
was
very
like
a
betrayal
venier
returned
his
greeting
with
some
coldness
which
contarini
hardly
noticed
as
his
reception
by
the
others
had
been
sufficiently
flattering
then
they
began
to
play
jacopo
won
from
the
first
foscari
bent
his
heavy
eyebrows
and
tugged
at
his
beard
angrily
as
he
lost
one
throw
after
another
the
cold
sweat
stood
on
mocenigo
forehead
in
beads
as
he
risked
more
and
more
and
loredan
hand
trembled
when
it
was
his
turn
to
take
up
the
dice
box
against
contarini
for
they
played
a
game
in
which
each
threw
against
all
the
rest
in
succession
you
can
not
say
that
the
dice
are
loaded
laughed
contarini
at
last
for
they
are
your
own
the
delicacy
of
the
thought
is
only
exceeded
by
the
good
taste
that
expresses
it
observed
venier
you
are
sarcastic
my
friend
answered
jacopo
shaking
the
dice
it
is
your
turn
with
me
jacopo
threw
first
venier
followed
him
and
lost
that
is
my
last
throw
he
said
as
he
pushed
the
remains
of
his
small
heap
of
gold
across
to
contarini
i
have
no
more
money
nor
shall
i
have
hossein
has
plenty
suggested
foscari
who
hoped
that
contarini
luck
would
desert
him
before
long
at
this
rate
you
will
need
all
he
has
returned
venier
with
a
careless
laugh
before
long
more
than
one
of
the
players
was
obliged
to
call
in
the
persian
merchant
and
the
heap
of
gold
grew
in
front
of
jacopo
till
he
could
hardly
keep
it
together
it
is
true
that
you
have
been
losing
for
years
said
mocenigo
trying
to
laugh
but
we
did
not
think
you
would
win
back
all
your
losses
in
a
day
you
shall
have
your
revenge
answered
contarini
rising
i
am
expected
at
a
friend
house
at
this
hour
his
large
wallet
was
so
full
of
gold
that
he
could
hardly
draw
the
strong
silken
strings
together
and
tie
them
a
friend
house
laughed
loredan
who
had
lost
somewhat
less
than
the
others
it
would
give
us
much
delight
to
know
the
colour
of
the
hair
to
this
contarini
answered
only
by
a
smile
which
was
not
devoid
of
satisfaction
take
care
said
foscari
gloomily
contemplating
the
bare
table
before
him
over
which
so
much
of
his
good
gold
had
slipped
away
take
care
luck
at
play
mischance
in
love
says
the
proverb
oh
in
that
case
i
congratulate
you
my
dear
friend
returned
contarini
gaily
the
others
laughed
at
the
retort
and
the
party
broke
up
though
all
did
not
go
at
once
venier
went
out
alone
while
two
or
three
walked
with
contarini
to
his
gondola
the
rest
stayed
behind
in
the
shop
and
made
old
hossein
unroll
his
choicest
carpets
and
show
them
his
most
precious
embroideries
though
he
protested
that
it
was
already
much
too
dark
to
appreciate
such
choice
things
but
they
did
not
wish
to
be
seen
coming
away
in
a
body
for
such
playing
was
very
strictly
forbidden
and
the
spies
of
the
ten
were
everywhere
contarini
dismissed
his
gondola
at
the
house
of
the
agnus
dei
and
was
admitted
by
the
trusted
servant
who
had
once
taken
a
message
to
zorzi
he
found
arisa
waiting
for
him
in
her
favourite
place
by
the
open
window
and
the
glow
of
the
setting
sun
made
little
fires
in
her
golden
hair
she
could
tell
by
his
face
that
he
had
been
fortunate
at
play
and
her
smile
was
very
soft
and
winning
as
he
sank
down
beside
her
in
the
luxurious
silence
of
satisfaction
her
fingers
were
stealthily
trying
the
weight
of
his
laden
wallet
she
could
not
lift
it
with
one
hand
she
smiled
again
as
she
thought
how
easily
aristarchi
would
carry
the
money
in
his
teeth
well
tied
and
knotted
in
a
kerchief
when
he
slipped
down
the
silk
rope
from
her
window
though
it
would
be
much
wiser
to
exchange
it
for
pearls
and
diamonds
which
contarini
might
see
and
admire
and
which
she
could
easily
take
with
her
in
her
final
flight
he
trusted
her
too
in
his
careless
way
and
that
night
when
he
was
ready
to
go
down
and
admit
his
companions
he
would
empty
most
of
the
gold
into
a
little
coffer
in
which
he
often
left
the
key
taking
but
just
enough
to
play
with
and
almost
sure
of
winning
more
she
was
very
gentle
on
that
evening
when
the
sun
had
gone
down
and
they
sat
in
the
deepening
dusk
and
she
spoke
sadly
of
not
seeing
him
for
several
hours
it
would
be
so
lonely
she
said
and
since
he
could
play
in
the
daytime
why
should
he
give
up
half
of
one
precious
night
to
those
tiresome
dice
he
laughed
indolently
pleased
that
she
should
not
even
suspect
the
real
object
of
the
meetings
by
and
by
when
it
was
an
hour
after
dark
and
they
had
eaten
of
delicate
things
which
a
silent
old
woman
brought
them
on
small
silver
platters
contarini
went
down
to
let
in
his
guests
and
arisa
was
alone
as
usual
on
such
evenings
for
a
long
time
she
lay
quite
still
among
the
cushions
in
the
dark
for
jacopo
had
taken
the
light
with
him
she
loved
to
be
in
darkness
as
she
always
told
him
and
for
very
good
reasons
and
she
had
so
accustomed
herself
to
it
as
to
see
almost
as
well
as
aristarchi
himself
for
whom
she
was
waiting
at
last
she
heard
the
expected
signal
of
his
coming
the
soft
and
repeated
splashing
of
an
oar
in
the
water
just
below
the
window
in
a
moment
she
was
in
the
inner
room
to
receive
him
in
her
straining
arms
longing
to
be
half
crushed
to
death
in
his
but
even
as
he
held
her
in
the
first
embrace
of
meeting
she
felt
that
something
had
happened
and
that
there
was
a
change
in
him
she
drew
him
to
the
little
light
that
burned
in
her
chamber
before
the
image
and
looked
into
his
face
terrified
at
the
thought
of
what
she
might
see
there
he
smiled
at
her
and
raised
his
shaggy
eyebrows
as
if
to
ask
if
she
really
distrusted
him
yes
he
said
nodding
his
big
head
slowly
something
has
happened
you
are
quick
at
guessing
we
are
going
there
is
moonlight
and
the
tide
will
serve
in
two
or
three
hours
get
ready
what
you
need
and
put
together
the
jewels
and
the
money
cried
arisa
very
much
surprised
do
you
really
mean
it
yes
i
am
in
earnest
michael
has
emptied
my
house
of
all
my
belongings
and
has
taken
the
keys
back
to
the
owner
we
have
plenty
of
time
for
i
suppose
those
overgrown
boys
are
playing
at
dice
downstairs
and
i
think
i
shall
take
leave
of
contarini
in
person
you
are
capable
of
anything
laughed
arisa
i
should
like
to
see
you
tear
him
into
little
strips
so
that
every
shred
should
keep
alive
to
be
tortured
how
amiable
what
gentle
thoughts
you
have
indeed
you
women
are
sweet
creatures
with
her
small
white
hand
she
jestingly
pretended
to
box
his
huge
ears
you
would
be
well
paid
if
i
refused
to
go
with
you
she
said
with
a
low
laugh
but
i
should
like
to
know
why
you
have
decided
so
suddenly
what
is
the
matter
what
is
to
become
of
all
our
plans
and
of
contarini
marriage
tell
me
quickly
i
have
had
a
visit
from
an
officer
of
the
ten
he
said
the
ten
send
me
greeting
as
it
were
and
their
service
and
kindly
invite
me
to
leave
venice
within
hours
as
the
ten
are
the
only
persons
in
venice
for
whom
i
have
the
smallest
respect
i
shall
show
it
by
accepting
their
invitation
but
why
what
have
you
done
of
course
it
is
not
a
serious
matter
to
give
a
sound
beating
to
an
officer
of
justice
and
six
of
his
men
answered
aristarchi
but
it
is
not
the
custom
here
and
they
suspect
me
of
having
done
it
to
tell
the
truth
i
think
i
am
hardly
treated
i
have
sent
zorzi
back
to
murano
and
if
the
ten
have
the
sense
to
look
for
him
where
he
has
been
living
for
five
years
they
will
find
him
at
once
at
work
in
that
stifling
but
i
fancy
that
is
too
simple
for
them
he
told
her
how
pasquale
had
come
in
the
morning
and
how
the
officer
who
had
been
in
pursuit
of
him
had
searched
the
ship
for
zorzi
in
vain
the
order
to
leave
venice
had
come
an
hour
later
the
anchors
were
now
up
and
the
vessel
was
riding
to
a
kedge
by
a
light
hawser
well
out
in
the
channel
as
soon
as
arisa
could
be
brought
on
board
aristarchi
meant
to
make
sail
for
the
strong
offshore
breeze
would
blow
all
night
we
may
as
well
leave
nothing
behind
said
aristarchi
coolly
michael
will
wait
for
us
below
in
one
of
the
ship
boats
there
is
room
for
all
contarini
possessions
if
we
could
only
get
at
them
would
it
not
be
better
to
be
content
with
what
we
have
already
and
to
go
at
once
asked
arisa
rather
timidly
no
replied
aristarchi
i
am
going
to
say
to
your
old
friend
in
my
own
way
do
you
mean
to
kill
him
asked
arisa
in
a
whisper
though
it
was
quite
safe
for
them
to
talk
in
natural
tones
i
could
go
behind
him
and
throw
something
over
his
head
aristarchi
grinned
and
pressed
her
beautiful
head
to
his
breast
caressing
her
with
his
rough
hands
you
are
as
bloodthirsty
as
a
little
tigress
he
said
no
i
do
not
even
mean
to
hurt
him
oh
i
hoped
you
would
answered
the
georgian
woman
i
have
hated
him
so
long
will
you
not
kill
him
just
to
please
me
we
could
wind
him
in
a
sheet
with
a
weight
you
know
and
drop
him
into
the
canal
and
no
one
would
ever
know
i
have
often
thought
of
it
have
you
my
gentle
little
sweetheart
aristarchi
chuckled
with
delight
as
he
stroked
her
hair
i
am
sorry
he
continued
the
fact
is
i
am
not
a
georgian
like
you
i
have
been
brought
up
among
people
of
civilisation
and
i
have
scruples
about
killing
any
one
besides
sweet
dove
if
we
were
to
kill
the
son
of
one
of
the
council
of
ten
the
council
would
pursue
us
wherever
we
went
for
venice
is
very
powerful
but
the
ten
will
not
lift
a
hand
to
revenge
a
young
gamester
whose
slave
has
run
away
with
her
first
love
every
one
will
laugh
at
contarini
if
he
tries
to
get
redress
it
is
better
to
laugh
than
to
be
laughed
at
it
is
better
to
be
laughed
at
than
to
cry
it
is
better
to
cry
one
eyes
blind
than
to
be
hanged
having
delivered
himself
of
these
opinions
aristarchi
began
to
look
about
him
for
whatever
might
be
worth
the
trouble
of
carrying
off
and
arisa
collected
all
her
jewels
from
the
caskets
in
which
they
were
kept
and
little
bags
of
gold
coins
which
she
had
hidden
in
different
places
she
also
lit
a
candle
and
brought
aristarchi
to
the
small
coffer
in
which
contarini
kept
ready
gold
for
play
and
which
was
now
more
than
half
full
the
dowry
of
the
daughter
observed
the
greek
as
he
carried
it
off
there
were
small
objects
of
gold
and
silver
on
the
tables
in
the
large
room
there
was
a
dagger
with
a
jewelled
hilt
an
illuminated
mass
book
in
a
chased
silver
case
you
will
need
it
on
sundays
at
sea
said
aristarchi
i
can
not
read
said
the
georgian
slave
regretfully
but
it
will
be
a
consolation
to
have
the
missal
aristarchi
smiled
and
tossed
the
book
upon
the
heap
of
things
it
would
be
amusing
to
pay
a
visit
to
those
young
fools
downstairs
and
to
take
all
their
money
and
leave
them
locked
up
for
the
night
he
said
as
if
a
thought
had
struck
him
there
are
too
many
of
them
answered
arisa
laying
her
hand
anxiously
upon
his
arm
and
they
are
all
armed
please
do
nothing
so
foolish
if
they
are
all
like
contarini
i
do
not
mind
twenty
of
them
or
so
laughed
aristarchi
they
must
have
more
than
a
thousand
gold
ducats
amongst
them
that
would
be
worth
taking
they
are
not
all
like
contarini
said
arisa
there
is
zuan
venier
for
instance
zuan
venier
is
he
one
of
them
i
have
heard
of
him
i
should
like
to
see
whether
he
could
be
frightened
for
they
say
it
is
impossible
aristarchi
scratched
his
head
pushing
his
shaggy
hair
forward
over
his
forehead
as
he
tried
to
think
of
an
effectual
scheme
for
producing
the
desired
result
the
ten
might
pursue
us
for
that
as
well
as
for
a
murder
said
arisa
meanwhile
the
friends
assembled
in
the
room
downstairs
had
been
occupied
for
a
long
time
in
hearing
what
zuan
venier
had
to
say
to
jacopo
contarini
concerning
the
latter
treatment
of
zorzi
for
venier
had
kept
his
word
and
as
soon
as
all
were
present
he
had
boldly
spoken
his
mind
in
a
tone
which
his
friends
were
not
accustomed
to
hear
at
first
contarini
had
answered
with
offended
surprise
asking
what
concern
it
could
be
of
venier
whether
a
miserable
were
exiled
or
not
and
he
appealed
to
the
others
asking
whether
it
would
not
be
far
better
for
them
all
that
such
an
outsider
as
zorzi
should
be
banished
from
venice
but
venier
retorted
that
the
dalmatian
had
taken
the
same
oath
as
the
rest
of
the
company
that
he
was
an
honest
man
besides
being
a
great
artist
as
his
master
asseverated
and
that
he
had
the
same
right
to
the
protection
of
each
and
all
of
them
as
contarini
himself
to
the
latter
astonishment
this
speech
was
received
with
unanimous
approbation
and
every
man
present
except
contarini
promised
his
help
and
that
of
his
family
so
far
as
he
might
obtain
it
i
have
advised
beroviero
venier
then
continued
if
he
can
find
the
young
artist
to
make
him
go
before
the
council
of
ten
of
his
own
free
will
taking
some
of
his
works
with
him
and
now
that
this
question
is
settled
i
propose
to
you
all
that
our
society
cease
to
have
any
political
or
revolutionary
aim
whatever
for
i
am
of
opinion
that
we
are
risking
our
necks
for
a
game
at
dice
and
for
nothing
else
which
is
childish
the
only
liberty
we
are
vindicating
so
far
as
i
can
see
is
that
of
gaming
as
much
as
we
please
and
if
we
do
that
and
nothing
more
we
shall
certainly
not
go
between
the
red
columns
for
it
a
fine
or
a
few
months
of
banishment
to
the
mainland
would
be
the
worst
that
could
happen
as
things
are
now
we
are
not
only
in
danger
of
losing
our
heads
at
any
moment
which
is
an
affair
of
merely
relative
importance
but
we
may
be
tempted
to
make
light
of
a
solemn
promise
which
seems
to
me
a
very
grave
matter
thereupon
venier
looked
round
the
table
and
almost
all
the
men
were
of
his
opinion
contarini
flushed
angrily
but
he
knew
himself
to
be
in
the
wrong
and
though
he
was
no
coward
he
had
not
the
sort
of
temper
that
faces
opposition
for
its
own
sake
he
therefore
began
to
rattle
the
dice
in
the
box
as
a
hint
to
all
that
the
discussion
was
at
an
end
but
his
good
fortune
seemed
gone
and
instead
of
winning
at
almost
every
throw
as
he
had
won
in
the
afternoon
he
soon
found
that
he
had
almost
exhausted
the
heap
of
gold
he
had
laid
on
the
table
and
which
he
had
thought
more
than
enough
he
staked
the
remainder
with
foscari
who
won
it
at
a
cast
and
laughed
you
offered
us
our
revenge
said
the
big
man
we
mean
to
take
it
but
though
contarini
was
not
a
good
fighter
he
was
a
good
gamester
and
never
allowed
himself
to
be
disturbed
by
he
joined
in
the
laugh
and
rose
from
the
table
you
must
forgive
me
he
said
if
i
leave
you
for
a
moment
i
must
fill
my
purse
before
i
play
again
do
not
stay
too
long
laughed
loredan
if
you
do
we
shall
come
and
get
you
and
then
we
shall
know
the
colour
of
the
lady
hair
contarini
laughed
as
he
went
to
the
door
opened
it
and
stealthily
set
the
key
in
the
lock
on
the
outside
i
shall
lock
you
in
while
i
am
gone
he
cried
you
are
far
too
inquisitive
laughing
gaily
he
turned
the
key
on
the
whole
company
and
he
heard
their
answering
laughter
as
he
went
away
for
they
accepted
the
jest
and
continued
playing
he
entered
the
large
room
upstairs
just
as
aristarchi
had
finished
tying
up
the
heavy
bundle
in
the
inner
chamber
arisa
heard
the
footstep
and
placed
one
hand
over
aristarchi
mouth
lest
he
should
speak
while
the
other
pointed
to
the
curtained
door
the
greek
held
his
breath
arisa
arisa
contarini
called
out
bring
me
a
light
sweetest
without
hesitation
arisa
took
the
lighted
candle
and
making
a
gesture
of
warning
to
aristarchi
went
quickly
to
the
other
room
the
greek
crept
towards
the
door
the
big
veins
standing
out
like
knots
on
his
rugged
temples
his
great
hands
opened
wide
with
the
tips
of
the
fingers
a
little
turned
in
he
was
like
a
wrestler
ready
to
get
his
hold
with
a
spring
i
want
some
more
money
contarini
was
saying
in
explanation
they
said
they
would
follow
me
if
i
stayed
too
long
so
i
have
locked
them
in
i
think
i
shall
keep
them
waiting
a
while
what
do
you
say
love
he
laughed
again
aloud
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
curtain
aristarchi
grinned
from
ear
to
ear
and
noiselessly
loosened
the
black
sash
he
wore
round
his
waist
for
once
in
his
life
as
zorzi
would
have
said
he
had
not
a
coil
of
rope
at
hand
when
he
needed
it
but
the
sash
was
strong
and
would
serve
the
purpose
he
pushed
the
curtain
aside
a
very
little
in
order
to
see
before
springing
contarini
stood
half
turned
away
from
the
door
clasping
arisa
to
his
breast
and
kissing
her
hair
the
next
moment
he
was
sprawling
on
the
floor
face
downwards
and
arisa
was
pressing
one
of
the
soft
cushions
from
the
divan
upon
his
head
to
smother
his
cries
while
aristarchi
bound
his
hands
firmly
together
behind
him
with
one
end
of
the
long
sash
and
in
spite
of
his
desperate
struggle
got
a
turn
with
the
rest
round
both
his
feet
drew
them
back
as
far
as
he
could
and
hitched
the
end
twice
jacopo
was
now
perfectly
helpless
but
he
was
not
yet
dumb
aristarchi
had
brought
his
tools
with
him
in
the
bosom
of
his
doublet
kneeling
on
contarini
shoulders
he
took
out
a
small
iron
instrument
shaped
exactly
like
a
pear
but
which
by
a
screw
placed
where
the
stem
would
be
could
be
made
to
open
out
in
four
parts
that
spread
like
the
petals
of
a
flower
arisa
looked
on
with
savage
interest
for
she
believed
that
it
was
some
horrible
instrument
of
torture
and
indeed
it
was
the
iron
gag
the
of
anguish
which
the
torturers
used
in
those
days
to
silence
those
whom
they
called
their
patients
holding
the
instrument
closed
aristarchi
pushed
his
hand
under
the
cushion
he
knew
that
contarini
mouth
would
be
open
as
he
must
be
half
suffocated
and
gasping
for
breath
in
an
instant
the
iron
pear
had
slipped
between
his
teeth
and
had
opened
its
relentless
leaves
obedient
to
the
screw
take
the
pillow
away
said
aristarchi
quietly
we
can
say
to
your
old
acquaintance
now
but
he
will
have
to
content
himself
with
nodding
his
head
in
a
friendly
way
he
turned
the
helpless
man
upon
his
side
for
owing
to
the
position
of
his
heels
and
hands
contarini
could
not
lie
on
his
back
then
aristarchi
set
the
candle
on
the
floor
near
his
face
and
looked
at
him
and
indulged
himself
in
a
low
laugh
contarini
face
was
deep
red
with
rage
and
suffocation
and
his
beautiful
brown
eyes
were
starting
from
their
sockets
with
a
terror
which
increased
when
he
saw
far
the
first
time
the
man
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
or
rather
who
was
about
to
deal
with
him
and
most
probably
without
mercy
then
he
caught
sight
of
arisa
smiling
at
him
but
not
as
she
had
been
wont
to
smile
aristarchi
spoke
at
last
in
an
easy
reassuring
tone
my
friend
he
said
i
am
not
going
to
hurt
you
any
more
you
may
think
it
strange
but
i
really
shall
not
kill
you
arisa
and
i
have
loved
each
other
for
a
long
time
and
since
she
has
lived
here
i
have
come
to
her
almost
every
night
i
know
your
house
almost
as
well
as
you
do
and
you
have
kindly
told
me
that
your
friends
are
all
looked
in
we
shall
therefore
not
have
the
trouble
of
leaving
by
the
window
since
we
can
go
out
by
the
front
door
where
my
boat
will
be
waiting
for
us
you
will
never
see
us
again
contarini
eyes
rolled
wildly
and
still
arisa
smiled
you
have
made
him
suffer
she
said
he
loved
me
before
we
go
continued
the
greek
folding
his
arms
and
looking
down
upon
his
miserable
enemy
i
think
it
fair
to
warn
you
that
under
the
in
arisa
room
there
is
an
air
shaft
through
which
we
have
heard
all
your
conversation
during
these
secret
meetings
of
yours
if
you
try
to
pursue
us
i
shall
send
information
to
the
ten
which
will
cut
off
most
of
your
heads
as
they
are
so
empty
it
might
seem
to
be
scarcely
worth
while
to
take
them
but
the
ten
know
best
i
can
rely
on
your
discretion
if
i
were
not
sure
of
it
i
would
accede
to
this
dear
lady
urgent
request
and
cut
you
up
into
small
pieces
contarini
writhed
and
sputtered
but
could
make
no
sound
i
promised
not
to
hurt
you
any
more
my
friend
and
i
am
a
man
of
my
word
but
i
have
long
admired
your
hair
and
beard
you
see
i
was
in
saint
mark
when
you
went
there
to
meet
the
daughter
and
i
have
seen
you
at
other
times
i
should
be
sorry
never
to
see
such
a
beautiful
beard
again
so
i
mean
to
take
it
with
me
and
if
you
will
keep
quiet
i
shall
really
not
hurt
you
thereupon
he
produced
from
his
doublet
a
bright
pair
of
shears
and
knelt
down
by
the
wretched
man
head
contarini
twisted
himself
as
be
might
and
tried
instinctively
to
draw
his
head
away
i
have
heard
that
pirates
sometimes
accidentally
cut
off
a
ear
said
aristarchi
if
you
will
not
move
i
am
quite
sure
that
i
shall
not
be
so
awkward
as
to
do
that
contarini
now
lay
motionless
and
aristarchi
went
to
work
with
the
utmost
neatness
he
cropped
off
the
silky
hair
so
close
to
skull
that
it
almost
looked
as
if
it
had
been
shaved
with
a
razor
in
the
same
way
he
clipped
the
splendid
beard
away
and
even
the
brown
eyebrows
till
there
was
not
a
hair
left
on
contarini
head
or
face
then
he
contemplated
his
work
and
laughed
at
the
weak
jaw
and
the
womanish
mouth
you
look
like
an
ugly
woman
in
man
clothes
he
said
by
way
of
consoling
his
victim
he
rose
now
for
he
feared
lest
contarini
friends
might
break
open
the
door
downstairs
he
shouldered
the
heavy
bundle
with
ease
set
his
blue
cap
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
bade
arisa
go
with
him
she
had
her
mantle
ready
but
she
could
not
resist
casting
delighted
glances
at
her
late
owner
face
before
going
she
knelt
down
one
moment
by
his
side
and
inclined
her
face
to
his
with
a
very
loving
gaze
lower
and
lower
she
bent
as
if
she
would
give
him
a
parting
kiss
till
aristarchi
uttered
an
exclamation
then
she
laughed
cruelly
and
with
the
back
of
her
hand
struck
the
lips
that
had
so
often
touched
her
own
a
few
moments
later
aristarchi
had
placed
her
in
his
boat
the
heavy
bundle
of
spoils
lay
at
her
feet
and
the
craft
shot
swiftly
from
the
door
of
the
house
of
the
agnus
dei
for
michael
pandos
the
mate
had
been
waiting
under
the
window
and
a
stroke
of
the
oars
brought
him
to
the
steps
in
the
closed
room
where
the
friends
were
playing
dice
there
began
to
be
some
astonishment
at
the
time
needed
by
jacopo
to
replenish
his
purse
when
more
than
half
an
hour
had
passed
one
pair
stopped
playing
and
then
another
until
they
were
all
listening
for
some
sound
in
the
silent
house
the
perfect
stillness
had
something
alarming
in
it
and
none
of
them
fully
trusted
contarini
i
think
said
venier
with
all
his
habitual
indolence
that
it
is
time
to
ascertain
the
colour
of
the
lady
hair
can
you
break
the
lock
he
spoke
to
foscari
who
nodded
and
went
to
the
door
with
two
or
three
others
in
a
few
seconds
it
flew
open
before
their
combined
attack
and
they
almost
lost
their
balance
as
they
staggered
out
into
the
dark
hall
the
rest
brought
lights
and
they
all
began
to
go
up
the
stairs
together
the
first
to
enter
the
room
was
foscari
venier
always
indifferent
was
among
the
last
foscari
started
at
the
extraordinary
sight
of
a
man
in
magnificent
clothes
lying
on
one
shoulder
with
his
heels
tied
up
to
his
hands
and
his
shorn
head
and
face
moving
slowly
from
side
to
side
in
the
bright
light
of
the
wax
candle
that
stood
on
the
floor
the
other
men
crowded
into
the
room
but
at
first
no
one
recognised
the
master
of
the
house
then
all
at
once
foscari
saw
the
rings
on
his
fingers
it
is
contarini
he
cried
and
somebody
has
shaved
his
head
he
burst
into
a
fit
of
uncontrollable
laughter
in
which
the
others
joined
till
the
house
rang
again
and
the
banished
servants
came
running
down
to
see
what
was
the
matter
only
zuan
venier
a
compassionate
smile
on
his
face
knelt
beside
contarini
and
carefully
withdrew
the
iron
gag
from
his
mouth
at
the
same
instant
aristarchi
hatchet
chopped
through
the
hawser
by
which
his
vessel
was
riding
and
he
took
the
helm
himself
to
steer
her
out
through
the
narrow
channel
before
the
wind
chapter
xxiii
when
pasquale
had
let
zorzi
in
he
crossed
the
canal
again
moored
the
skiff
with
lock
and
chain
and
came
back
by
the
wooden
bridge
zorzi
went
on
through
the
corridor
and
came
out
into
the
moonlit
garden
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
only
hours
had
passed
since
he
had
left
it
but
the
freshly
dug
earth
told
him
of
giovanni
search
about
which
pasquale
had
told
him
and
there
was
the
pleasant
certainty
that
the
master
had
come
home
and
could
probably
protect
him
even
against
the
ten
besides
this
he
felt
stronger
and
more
able
to
move
than
since
he
had
been
injured
and
he
was
sure
that
he
could
now
walk
with
only
a
stick
to
help
him
though
he
was
always
to
be
lame
he
had
looked
up
at
marietta
window
before
leaving
the
boat
but
it
was
dark
for
pasquale
had
wished
to
be
sure
that
no
one
should
see
zorzi
and
it
was
long
past
the
young
girl
bedtime
pasquale
came
back
and
produced
some
more
bread
and
cheese
from
his
lodge
for
both
men
were
hungry
they
sat
down
on
the
bench
under
the
and
ate
their
meagre
supper
together
in
silence
for
they
had
talked
much
during
the
long
day
then
pasquale
bade
zorzi
good
night
and
went
away
and
zorzi
went
into
the
laboratory
where
all
was
dark
but
he
knew
every
brick
of
the
furnace
and
every
stone
of
the
pavement
under
his
feet
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
fast
asleep
in
his
own
bed
feeling
as
safe
as
if
the
ten
had
never
existed
and
as
though
the
signors
of
the
night
were
not
searching
every
purlieu
of
venice
to
take
him
into
custody
and
early
in
the
morning
he
got
up
and
pasquale
brought
him
water
as
of
old
and
as
his
hose
and
doublet
had
suffered
considerably
during
his
adventures
he
put
on
the
sunday
ones
and
came
out
into
the
garden
to
breathe
the
morning
air
pasquale
had
no
intention
of
going
over
to
the
house
to
announce
zorzi
return
for
he
was
firmly
convinced
that
the
most
simple
way
of
keeping
a
secret
was
not
to
tell
it
and
before
long
the
master
would
probably
come
over
himself
to
ask
for
news
beroviero
brought
marietta
with
him
as
he
often
did
and
when
they
were
within
he
naturally
stopped
to
question
pasquale
about
his
search
while
marietta
went
on
to
the
garden
the
porter
took
a
long
time
to
shut
the
door
and
instead
of
answering
beroviero
shook
his
ugly
head
discontentedly
and
muttered
imprecations
on
all
makers
of
locks
latches
bolts
bars
and
other
fastenings
living
dead
and
yet
unborn
so
it
came
to
pass
that
marietta
came
upon
zorzi
suddenly
and
alone
when
she
least
expected
to
meet
him
he
was
standing
by
the
leaning
on
his
stick
with
one
hand
and
lifting
up
a
trailing
branch
with
the
other
but
when
he
heard
marietta
step
he
let
the
branch
drop
again
and
stood
waiting
for
her
with
happy
eyes
she
uttered
a
little
cry
that
was
almost
of
fear
and
stopped
short
in
her
walk
for
in
the
first
instant
she
could
have
believed
that
she
saw
a
vision
then
she
ran
forward
with
outstretched
hands
and
fell
into
his
arms
as
he
dropped
his
stick
to
catch
her
as
her
head
touched
his
shoulder
her
heart
stopped
beating
for
a
moment
she
gasped
a
little
and
seemed
to
choke
and
then
the
tears
of
joy
flowed
from
her
eyes
her
pulses
stirred
again
and
all
was
well
he
felt
a
tremor
in
his
hands
and
could
not
speak
aloud
but
as
he
held
her
he
bent
down
and
whispered
something
in
her
ear
and
she
smiled
through
the
shower
of
her
happy
tears
though
he
could
not
see
it
for
her
face
was
hidden
just
then
beroviero
entered
from
the
corridor
followed
by
pasquale
and
the
two
old
men
stood
still
together
gazing
at
the
young
lovers
it
was
on
that
very
spot
that
the
master
when
going
upon
his
journey
had
told
zorzi
how
he
wished
he
were
his
son
but
now
he
forgot
that
he
had
said
it
and
the
angry
blood
rushed
to
his
forehead
how
dare
you
he
cried
as
he
made
a
step
to
go
on
towards
the
pair
they
heard
his
voice
and
separated
hastily
marietta
fresh
cheek
blushed
like
red
roses
and
she
looked
down
as
shamefacedly
as
any
country
maid
but
zorzi
turned
white
as
he
stooped
to
pick
up
his
stick
then
stood
quite
upright
and
met
her
father
eyes
how
dare
you
i
say
repeated
the
old
man
fiercely
i
love
her
sir
zorzi
answered
without
fear
for
himself
but
with
much
apprehension
for
marietta
and
have
you
forgotten
that
i
love
him
father
asked
marietta
looking
up
but
still
blushing
you
know
i
told
you
all
the
truth
and
you
were
not
angry
then
at
least
you
were
not
so
very
angry
she
added
shyly
correcting
herself
if
she
has
told
you
sir
zorzi
began
let
me
you
can
tell
me
nothing
i
do
not
know
cried
beroviero
and
nothing
i
wish
to
hear
be
off
go
to
the
laboratory
and
begin
work
i
will
speak
with
my
daughter
then
pasquale
voice
was
heard
a
furnace
without
a
fire
is
like
a
ship
without
a
wind
he
said
it
might
as
well
be
anything
else
beroviero
looked
towards
the
old
porter
indignantly
but
pasquale
had
already
begun
to
move
and
was
returning
to
his
lodge
uttering
strange
and
unearthly
sounds
as
he
went
for
he
was
so
happy
that
he
was
really
trying
to
hum
a
tune
the
master
turned
to
the
lovers
again
zorzi
had
withdrawn
a
step
or
two
but
showed
no
signs
of
going
further
if
you
are
going
to
tell
me
that
i
must
change
my
mind
said
marietta
and
that
it
is
a
shame
to
love
a
penniless
silence
cried
the
old
man
stroking
his
beard
fiercely
how
can
you
presume
to
guess
what
i
may
or
may
not
say
about
your
shameless
conduct
did
i
not
see
him
kissing
you
i
daresay
for
he
did
answered
marietta
raising
her
eyebrows
and
looking
down
in
a
resigned
way
and
it
is
not
the
first
time
either
she
added
shaking
her
head
and
almost
laughing
the
insolence
cried
beroviero
the
atrocious
boldness
sir
said
zorzi
coming
nearer
there
is
only
one
remedy
for
it
give
me
your
daughter
for
my
wife
upon
my
faith
this
is
too
much
you
know
that
marietta
is
betrothed
to
messer
jacopo
contarini
i
have
told
you
that
i
will
not
marry
him
said
marietta
quietly
so
it
is
just
as
if
i
had
never
been
betrothed
to
him
that
is
no
reason
for
marrying
zorzi
retorted
beroviero
a
pretty
match
for
you
angelo
beroviero
daughter
and
a
penniless
foreigner
who
can
not
even
be
allowed
to
work
openly
at
his
art
if
i
go
away
zorzi
answered
quietly
i
may
soon
be
as
rich
as
you
sir
at
this
unexpected
statement
beroviero
opened
his
eyes
in
real
astonishment
while
zorzi
continued
you
have
your
secrets
sir
and
i
have
kept
them
safe
for
you
but
i
have
one
of
my
own
which
is
as
valuable
as
any
of
yours
did
you
find
some
pieces
of
my
work
in
the
annealing
oven
i
see
that
they
are
on
the
table
now
did
you
notice
that
the
glass
is
like
yours
but
finer
and
lighter
well
if
it
is
what
then
asked
beroviero
it
was
an
accident
you
mixed
something
with
some
of
my
glass
no
answered
zorzi
it
is
altogether
a
composition
of
my
own
i
do
not
know
how
you
mix
your
materials
how
should
i
i
believe
you
do
said
beroviero
i
believe
you
have
found
it
out
in
some
way
zorzi
had
produced
a
piece
of
folded
paper
from
his
doublet
and
now
held
it
up
in
his
hand
i
am
not
bargaining
with
you
sir
for
you
are
a
man
of
honour
angelo
beroviero
will
not
rob
me
after
having
been
kind
to
me
for
so
many
years
this
is
my
secret
which
i
discovered
alone
with
no
one
help
the
quantities
are
written
out
very
exactly
and
i
am
sure
of
them
read
what
is
written
there
by
an
accident
i
may
have
made
something
like
your
glass
but
i
do
not
believe
it
he
held
out
the
paper
beroviero
manner
changed
you
were
always
an
honourable
fellow
zorzi
i
thank
you
he
opened
the
paper
and
looked
attentively
at
the
contents
marietta
saw
his
surprise
and
interest
and
took
the
opportunity
of
smiling
at
zorzi
it
is
altogether
different
from
mine
said
beroviero
looking
up
and
handing
back
the
document
is
there
fortune
in
that
sir
or
not
asked
zorzi
confident
of
the
reply
but
you
know
that
there
is
and
that
whenever
i
go
if
i
can
get
a
furnace
i
shall
soon
be
a
rich
man
by
the
glass
alone
without
even
counting
on
such
skill
as
i
have
with
my
hands
it
is
true
answered
the
master
nodding
his
head
thoughtfully
there
are
many
princes
who
would
willingly
give
you
the
little
you
need
in
order
to
make
your
fortune
the
little
that
venice
refuses
me
said
zorzi
with
some
bitterness
am
i
presuming
so
much
then
when
i
ask
you
for
your
daughter
hand
is
it
not
in
my
power
or
will
it
not
be
very
soon
to
go
to
some
other
city
to
milan
or
florence
no
no
cried
beroviero
you
shall
not
take
her
away
he
stopped
short
realising
that
he
had
betrayed
what
had
been
in
his
mind
since
he
had
seen
the
two
standing
there
clasped
in
one
arms
namely
that
in
spite
of
him
or
with
his
blessing
his
daughter
would
before
long
be
married
to
the
man
she
loved
come
come
he
said
testily
this
is
sheer
nonsense
he
made
a
step
forward
as
if
to
break
off
the
situation
by
going
away
if
you
would
rather
that
i
should
not
leave
you
sir
said
zorzi
i
will
stay
here
and
make
my
glass
in
your
furnace
and
you
shall
sell
it
as
if
it
were
your
own
yes
father
say
yes
cried
marietta
clasping
her
hands
upon
the
old
man
shoulder
you
see
how
generous
zorzi
is
generous
beroviero
shook
his
head
he
is
trying
to
bribe
me
for
there
is
a
fortune
in
his
glass
as
he
says
he
is
offering
me
a
fortune
i
tell
you
to
let
him
marry
you
the
fortune
which
messer
jacopo
had
made
you
promise
to
pay
him
for
condescending
to
be
my
husband
retorted
marietta
triumphantly
it
seems
to
me
that
of
the
two
zorzi
is
the
better
match
beroviero
stared
at
her
a
moment
bewildered
then
in
despair
he
clapped
both
his
hands
upon
his
ears
and
shook
himself
gently
free
from
her
was
there
ever
a
woman
yet
who
could
not
make
black
seem
white
he
cried
it
is
nonsense
i
tell
you
it
is
all
arrant
nonsense
you
are
driving
me
out
of
my
senses
and
thereupon
he
went
off
down
the
garden
path
to
the
laboratory
apparently
forgetting
that
his
presence
alone
could
prevent
a
repetition
of
that
very
offence
which
had
at
first
roused
his
anger
the
door
closed
sharply
after
him
with
energetic
emphasis
at
the
same
moment
marietta
who
had
been
gazing
into
zorzi
eyes
felt
that
her
own
sparkled
with
amusement
and
her
father
might
almost
have
heard
her
sweet
low
laugh
through
the
open
window
at
the
other
end
of
the
garden
that
was
well
done
she
said
between
us
we
have
almost
persuaded
him
zorzi
took
her
willing
hand
and
drew
her
to
him
and
she
was
almost
as
near
to
him
as
before
when
she
straightened
herself
with
quick
and
elastic
grace
and
laughed
again
no
no
she
said
if
he
were
to
look
out
and
see
us
again
it
would
be
too
ridiculous
come
and
sit
under
the
in
the
old
place
do
you
remember
how
you
stared
at
the
trunk
and
would
not
answer
me
when
i
tried
to
make
you
speak
ever
so
long
ago
do
you
know
it
was
because
you
would
not
say
what
i
wanted
you
to
say
that
i
let
myself
think
that
i
could
marry
messer
jacopo
if
you
had
only
known
what
you
were
doing
if
i
had
only
known
zorzi
echoed
as
they
reached
the
place
and
marietta
sat
down
they
were
within
sight
of
the
window
but
beroviero
did
not
heed
them
he
was
seated
in
his
own
chair
in
deep
thought
his
elbows
resting
on
the
wooden
arms
his
fingers
pressing
his
temples
on
each
side
thinking
of
his
daughter
and
perhaps
not
quite
unaware
that
she
was
talking
to
the
only
man
he
had
ever
really
trusted
i
must
tell
you
something
zorzi
she
was
saying
as
she
looked
up
into
the
face
she
loved
my
father
told
me
last
night
what
he
had
done
yesterday
he
saw
messer
zuan
venier
zorzi
showed
his
surprise
pasquale
told
my
father
that
he
had
been
here
to
see
you
very
well
this
messer
zuan
advised
that
if
you
could
be
found
you
should
be
persuaded
to
go
before
the
tribunal
of
the
ten
of
your
own
free
will
to
tell
your
story
and
he
promised
to
use
all
his
influence
and
that
of
all
his
friends
in
your
favour
they
will
not
change
the
law
for
me
zorzi
replied
in
a
hopeless
way
if
they
could
hear
you
they
would
make
a
special
decree
said
marietta
you
could
tell
them
your
story
you
could
even
show
them
some
of
the
beautiful
things
you
have
made
they
would
understand
that
you
are
a
great
artist
after
all
my
father
says
that
one
of
their
most
especial
duties
is
to
deal
with
everything
that
concerns
murano
and
the
do
you
think
that
they
will
banish
you
now
that
you
have
a
secret
of
your
own
and
can
injure
us
all
by
setting
up
a
furnace
somewhere
else
there
is
no
sense
in
that
and
if
you
go
of
your
own
free
will
they
will
hear
you
kindly
i
think
but
if
you
stay
here
they
will
find
you
in
the
end
and
they
will
be
very
angry
then
because
you
will
have
been
hiding
from
them
you
are
wise
zorzi
answered
you
are
very
wise
no
i
love
you
she
spoke
softly
and
glanced
at
the
open
window
and
then
at
his
face
truly
he
smiled
happily
as
he
whispered
his
question
in
one
word
and
he
was
resting
a
hand
on
the
trunk
of
the
tree
just
as
he
had
been
standing
on
the
day
she
remembered
so
well
ah
you
know
it
now
she
answered
with
bright
and
trusting
eyes
one
may
know
a
song
well
and
yet
long
to
hear
it
again
and
again
but
one
can
not
be
always
singing
it
oneself
she
said
i
could
never
make
it
ring
as
sweetly
as
you
zorzi
answered
try
it
i
am
tired
of
hearing
my
voice
but
i
am
not
there
is
no
voice
like
it
in
the
world
i
shall
never
care
to
hear
another
as
long
as
i
live
nor
any
other
song
nor
any
other
words
and
when
you
are
weary
of
saying
them
i
shall
just
say
them
over
in
my
heart
loves
me
she
loves
me
all
day
long
which
is
better
marietta
asked
to
love
or
to
know
that
you
are
loved
the
two
thoughts
are
like
soul
and
body
zorzi
answered
you
must
not
part
them
i
never
have
since
i
have
known
the
truth
and
never
shall
again
then
they
were
silent
for
a
while
but
they
hardly
knew
it
for
the
world
was
full
of
the
sweetest
music
they
had
ever
heard
and
they
listened
together
zorzi
the
master
was
at
the
window
calling
him
he
started
a
little
as
if
awaking
and
obeyed
the
summons
as
quickly
as
his
lameness
would
allow
marietta
looked
after
him
watching
his
halting
gait
and
the
little
effort
he
made
with
his
stick
at
each
step
for
some
secret
reason
the
injury
had
made
him
more
dear
to
her
and
she
liked
to
remember
how
brave
he
had
been
he
found
beroviero
busy
with
his
papers
and
the
results
of
the
experiments
and
the
old
man
at
once
spoke
to
him
as
if
nothing
unusual
had
happened
telling
him
what
to
do
from
time
to
time
so
that
all
might
be
put
in
order
against
the
time
when
the
fires
should
be
lighted
again
in
september
by
and
by
two
men
came
carrying
a
new
earthen
jar
for
broken
glass
and
all
fragments
in
which
the
box
had
lain
were
shovelled
into
it
and
the
pieces
of
the
old
one
were
taken
away
the
furnace
was
not
quite
cool
even
yet
and
the
crucibles
might
remain
where
they
were
for
a
few
days
but
there
was
much
to
be
done
and
zorzi
was
kept
at
work
all
the
morning
while
marietta
sat
in
the
shade
with
her
work
often
looking
towards
the
window
and
sometimes
catching
sight
of
zorzi
as
he
moved
about
within
meanwhile
the
story
of
contarini
mishap
had
spread
in
venice
like
wildfire
and
before
noon
there
was
hardly
one
of
all
his
many
relations
and
friends
who
had
not
heard
it
the
tale
ran
through
the
town
told
by
high
and
low
by
jacopo
own
trusted
servant
and
the
old
woman
who
had
waited
on
arisa
and
it
had
reached
the
at
an
early
hour
so
that
the
were
busy
with
it
for
many
had
known
of
the
existence
of
the
beautiful
georgian
slave
and
the
subject
was
a
good
one
for
a
song
how
she
had
caressed
him
to
sleep
and
fostered
his
foolish
security
while
he
loved
her
blindly
and
how
she
and
her
mysterious
lover
had
bound
him
and
shaved
his
head
and
face
and
made
him
a
so
that
he
must
hide
himself
from
the
world
for
months
and
moreover
how
they
had
carried
away
by
night
all
the
precious
gifts
he
had
heaped
upon
the
woman
since
he
had
bought
her
in
the
last
of
all
his
father
heard
it
when
he
came
home
about
an
hour
before
noon
from
the
sitting
of
the
council
of
ten
of
which
he
was
a
member
for
that
year
he
found
zuan
venier
waiting
in
the
hall
of
his
house
and
the
two
remained
closeted
together
for
some
time
for
the
young
man
had
promised
jacopo
to
tell
old
contarini
though
it
was
an
ungrateful
errand
and
one
which
the
latter
might
remember
against
him
but
it
was
a
kind
action
and
venier
performed
it
as
well
as
he
could
telling
the
story
truthfully
but
leaving
out
all
such
useless
details
as
might
increase
the
father
anger
at
first
indeed
the
old
man
brought
his
hand
down
heavily
upon
the
table
and
swore
that
he
would
never
see
his
son
again
that
he
would
propose
to
the
ten
to
banish
him
from
venice
that
he
would
disinherit
him
and
let
him
starve
as
he
deserved
and
much
more
to
the
same
effect
but
venier
entreated
him
for
his
own
dignity
sake
to
do
none
of
these
things
but
to
send
jacopo
to
his
villa
on
the
brenta
river
where
he
might
devote
himself
in
seclusion
to
growing
his
hair
and
beard
again
and
zuan
represented
that
if
he
reappeared
in
venice
after
many
months
not
very
greatly
changed
the
adventure
would
be
so
far
forgotten
that
his
life
among
his
friends
would
be
at
least
bearable
in
spite
of
the
ridicule
to
which
he
would
now
and
then
be
exposed
for
the
rest
of
his
life
whenever
any
one
chose
out
of
spite
to
mention
barbers
shears
razors
specifies
for
causing
the
hair
to
grow
or
georgians
in
his
presence
further
venier
ventured
to
suggest
to
contarini
that
he
should
at
once
break
off
the
marriage
arranged
with
beroviero
rather
than
expose
himself
to
the
inevitable
indignity
of
letting
the
step
be
taken
by
the
who
said
venier
would
as
soon
think
of
giving
his
daughter
to
a
turk
as
to
jacopo
since
the
latter
graceless
doings
had
been
suddenly
held
up
to
the
light
as
the
of
all
venice
in
making
this
suggestion
venier
had
followed
the
suggestion
of
his
own
good
sense
and
good
feeling
and
contarini
not
only
accepted
the
proposal
but
was
in
the
utmost
haste
to
act
upon
it
fearing
lest
at
any
moment
a
messenger
might
come
over
from
murano
with
the
news
that
beroviero
withdrew
his
consent
to
the
marriage
venier
almost
dictated
the
letter
which
contarini
wrote
with
a
trembling
hand
and
he
promised
to
deliver
it
himself
and
if
necessary
to
act
as
ambassador
beroviero
had
already
called
to
marietta
that
it
was
time
to
go
home
though
the
bells
had
not
yet
rung
out
the
hour
when
pasquale
appeared
in
the
garden
and
announced
that
venier
was
waiting
in
his
gondola
and
desired
an
immediate
interview
on
a
matter
of
importance
he
would
have
come
on
contarini
behalf
if
for
no
other
reason
but
he
had
spent
much
time
that
morning
in
laying
zorzi
case
before
his
friends
and
all
the
members
of
the
grand
council
who
could
have
any
special
influence
with
the
ten
or
with
the
aged
doge
who
although
in
his
eightieth
year
frequently
assisted
in
person
at
their
meetings
and
whose
counsellors
were
always
present
he
was
now
almost
sure
of
obtaining
a
favourable
hearing
for
zorzi
and
wished
to
see
beroviero
for
he
was
still
in
ignorance
of
zorzi
return
to
the
during
the
night
marietta
was
told
to
go
into
the
deserted
building
containing
the
main
furnaces
now
extinguished
for
it
was
not
fitting
that
she
should
be
seen
by
a
patrician
whom
she
did
not
know
sitting
in
the
garden
as
if
she
were
a
mere
whose
face
needed
no
veil
she
ran
away
laughing
and
hid
herself
in
the
passage
where
she
had
spent
moments
of
anguish
on
the
night
of
zorzi
arrest
and
she
waved
a
kiss
to
him
when
her
father
was
not
watching
zorzi
waited
at
the
door
of
the
laboratory
while
beroviero
waited
within
standing
by
the
table
to
receive
his
honourable
visitor
when
zorzi
saw
venier
expression
of
astonishment
on
seeing
him
he
smiled
quietly
but
offered
no
audible
greeting
for
he
did
not
know
what
was
expected
of
him
but
venier
took
his
hand
frankly
and
held
it
a
moment
i
am
glad
to
find
you
here
he
said
less
indolently
than
he
usually
spoke
i
have
good
news
for
you
if
you
will
take
my
advice
the
master
has
already
told
me
what
it
is
zorzi
answered
i
am
ready
to
give
myself
up
whenever
you
think
best
i
have
not
words
to
thank
you
i
do
not
like
many
words
answered
venier
but
if
there
is
anything
i
dislike
more
it
is
thanks
i
have
some
private
business
with
messer
angelo
first
afterwards
we
can
all
three
talk
together
chapter
xxiv
zorzi
sat
on
a
low
bench
blackened
with
age
against
the
whitewashed
wall
of
a
small
and
dimly
lighted
room
which
was
little
more
than
a
cell
but
was
in
reality
the
place
where
prisoners
waited
immediately
before
being
taken
into
the
presence
of
the
ten
it
was
not
far
from
the
dreaded
chamber
in
which
the
three
chiefs
sometimes
heard
evidence
given
under
torture
the
door
was
closed
and
two
guards
paced
the
narrow
corridor
outside
with
regular
and
heavy
steps
to
which
zorzi
listened
with
a
beating
heart
he
was
not
afraid
for
he
was
not
easily
frightened
but
he
knew
that
his
whole
future
life
was
in
the
balance
and
he
longed
for
the
decisive
moment
to
come
he
had
surrendered
on
the
previous
day
and
beroviero
had
given
a
large
bond
for
his
appearance
there
were
witnesses
of
all
that
had
happened
there
was
the
lieutenant
of
the
archers
with
his
six
men
some
of
whom
still
showed
traces
of
their
misadventure
there
was
giovanni
whom
the
governor
had
forced
to
appear
much
against
his
will
as
the
principal
accuser
by
the
letter
which
had
led
to
zorzi
arrest
and
the
letter
itself
was
in
the
hands
of
the
council
secretary
but
there
was
also
pasquale
who
had
seen
zorzi
go
away
quietly
with
the
soldiers
and
who
could
speak
for
his
character
and
angelo
beroviero
was
there
to
tell
the
truth
as
far
as
he
knew
it
but
zorzi
was
not
to
be
confronted
with
any
of
these
witnesses
neither
with
the
soldiers
who
would
tell
the
council
strange
stories
of
devils
with
blue
noses
and
fiery
tails
nor
with
giovanni
whose
letter
called
him
a
liar
a
thief
and
an
assassin
nor
with
beroviero
nor
pasquale
the
council
never
allowed
the
accused
man
and
the
witnesses
for
or
against
him
to
be
before
them
at
the
same
time
nor
to
hold
any
communication
while
the
trial
lasted
that
was
a
rule
of
their
procedure
but
they
were
not
by
any
means
the
mysterious
body
of
malign
monsters
which
they
have
too
often
been
represented
to
be
in
an
age
when
no
criminal
trials
could
take
place
without
torture
zorzi
waited
on
his
bench
listening
to
the
tread
of
the
guards
as
many
trials
occupied
more
than
one
day
his
case
would
come
up
last
of
all
and
the
witnesses
would
all
be
examined
before
he
himself
was
called
to
make
his
defence
he
was
nervous
and
anxious
even
while
he
was
sitting
there
giovanni
might
be
finding
out
some
new
accusation
against
him
or
the
officer
of
archers
might
be
accusing
him
of
witchcraft
and
of
having
a
compact
with
the
devil
himself
he
was
innocent
but
he
had
broken
the
law
and
no
doubt
many
an
innocent
man
had
sat
on
that
same
bench
before
him
who
had
never
again
returned
to
his
home
it
was
not
strange
that
his
lips
should
be
parched
and
that
his
heart
should
be
beating
like
a
fuller
hammer
at
last
the
footsteps
ceased
the
key
ground
and
creaked
as
it
turned
and
the
door
was
opened
two
tall
guards
stood
looking
at
him
and
one
of
them
motioned
to
him
to
come
he
could
never
afterwards
remember
the
place
through
which
he
was
made
to
pass
for
the
blood
was
throbbing
in
his
temples
so
that
he
could
hardly
see
a
door
was
opened
and
closed
after
him
and
he
was
suddenly
standing
alone
in
the
presence
of
the
ten
feeling
that
he
could
not
find
a
word
to
say
if
he
were
called
upon
to
speak
a
kindly
voice
broke
the
silence
that
seemed
to
have
lasted
many
minutes
is
this
the
person
whom
we
are
told
is
in
league
with
satan
it
was
the
doge
himself
who
spoke
nodding
his
hoary
head
as
very
old
men
do
and
looking
at
zorzi
face
with
gentle
eyes
almost
colourless
from
extreme
age
this
is
the
accused
your
highness
replied
the
secretary
from
his
desk
already
holding
in
his
hand
giovanni
letter
zorzi
saw
that
the
council
of
ten
was
much
more
numerous
than
its
name
implied
the
councillors
were
between
twenty
and
thirty
sitting
in
a
semicircle
against
a
carved
wooden
wainscot
on
each
side
of
the
aged
doge
cristoforo
moro
who
had
yet
one
more
year
to
live
there
were
other
persons
present
also
of
whom
one
was
the
secretary
the
rest
being
apparently
there
to
listen
to
the
proceedings
and
to
give
advice
when
they
were
called
upon
to
do
so
in
spite
of
the
time
of
year
the
councillors
were
all
splendidly
robed
in
the
red
velvet
mantles
edged
with
ermine
and
the
velvet
caps
which
made
up
the
state
dress
of
all
patricians
alike
and
the
doge
wore
his
peculiar
cap
and
coronet
of
office
zorzi
had
never
seen
such
an
assembly
of
imposing
and
venerable
men
some
with
long
grey
beards
some
close
shaven
all
grave
all
thoughtful
all
watching
him
with
quietly
scrutinising
eyes
he
stood
leaning
a
little
on
his
stick
and
he
breathed
more
freely
since
the
dreaded
moment
was
come
at
last
some
one
bade
the
secretary
read
the
accusation
and
zorzi
listened
with
wonder
and
disgust
to
giovanni
long
epistle
mentally
noting
the
points
which
he
might
answer
and
realising
that
if
the
law
was
to
be
interpreted
literally
he
had
undoubtedly
rendered
himself
liable
to
some
penalty
what
have
you
to
say
inquired
the
secretary
looking
up
from
the
paper
with
a
pair
of
small
and
piercing
grey
eyes
the
supreme
council
will
hear
your
defence
i
can
tell
the
truth
said
zorzi
simply
and
when
he
had
spoken
the
words
he
was
surprised
that
his
voice
had
not
trembled
that
is
all
the
supreme
council
wishes
to
hear
answered
the
secretary
speak
on
it
is
true
that
i
am
a
dalmatian
zorzi
said
and
by
the
laws
of
venice
i
should
not
have
learned
the
art
of
i
came
to
murano
more
than
five
years
ago
being
very
poor
and
messer
angelo
beroviero
took
me
in
and
let
me
take
care
of
his
private
furnace
at
which
he
makes
many
experiments
in
time
he
trusted
me
and
when
he
wished
something
made
to
try
the
nature
of
the
glass
he
let
me
make
it
but
not
to
sell
such
things
at
first
they
were
badly
made
but
i
loved
the
art
and
in
short
time
i
grew
to
be
skilful
at
it
so
i
learnt
sirs
i
crave
pardon
your
highness
and
you
lords
of
the
supreme
council
that
is
all
i
have
to
tell
i
love
the
glass
and
i
can
make
light
things
of
it
in
good
design
because
i
love
it
as
the
painter
loves
his
colours
and
the
sculptor
his
marble
give
me
glass
and
i
will
make
coloured
air
of
it
and
gossamer
and
silk
and
lace
it
is
all
i
know
it
is
my
art
i
live
in
it
i
feel
in
it
i
dream
in
it
to
my
thoughts
and
eyes
and
hands
it
is
what
the
love
of
a
fair
woman
is
to
the
heart
while
i
can
work
and
shape
the
things
i
see
when
i
close
my
eyes
the
sun
does
not
move
the
day
has
no
time
winter
no
clouds
and
summer
no
heat
when
i
am
hindered
i
am
in
exile
and
in
prison
and
alone
the
doge
nodded
his
head
in
kindly
approbation
the
young
man
is
a
true
artist
he
said
all
this
said
one
of
the
chiefs
of
the
ten
would
be
well
if
you
were
a
venetian
but
you
are
not
and
the
accusation
says
that
you
have
sold
your
works
to
the
injury
of
born
venetians
what
have
you
to
say
sometimes
my
master
has
given
me
money
for
a
beaker
or
a
plate
or
a
bottle
answered
zorzi
in
some
trepidation
for
this
was
the
main
point
but
the
things
were
then
his
own
how
could
that
do
harm
to
any
one
since
no
one
can
make
what
i
can
make
for
the
master
own
use
and
once
the
other
day
as
the
signor
giovanni
letter
says
there
he
persuaded
me
to
take
his
piece
of
gold
for
a
beaker
he
saw
in
my
hand
and
i
said
that
i
would
ask
the
master
when
he
came
back
whether
i
might
keep
the
money
or
not
and
besides
i
left
the
piece
of
money
on
the
table
in
my
master
laboratory
and
the
beaker
in
the
annealing
oven
when
they
came
to
arrest
me
that
is
the
only
work
for
which
i
ever
took
money
except
from
the
master
himself
why
did
the
greek
captain
aristarchi
beat
the
governor
men
and
carry
you
away
asked
another
of
the
chiefs
zorzi
was
not
surprised
that
the
name
of
his
rescuer
should
be
known
for
the
ten
were
believed
to
possess
universal
intelligence
i
do
not
know
he
answered
quite
simply
he
did
not
tell
me
while
he
kept
me
with
him
i
had
only
seen
him
once
before
that
night
on
a
day
when
he
came
to
treat
with
the
master
for
a
cargo
of
glass
which
he
never
bought
i
gave
myself
up
to
the
archers
as
i
gave
myself
up
to
your
lordships
for
i
thought
that
i
should
have
justice
the
sooner
if
i
sought
it
instead
of
trying
to
escape
from
it
your
highness
said
one
of
the
oldest
councillors
addressing
the
doge
is
it
not
a
pity
that
such
a
man
as
this
who
is
a
good
artist
and
who
speaks
the
truth
should
be
driven
out
of
venice
by
a
law
that
was
not
meant
to
touch
him
for
indeed
the
law
exists
and
always
will
but
it
is
meant
to
hinder
strangers
from
coming
to
murano
and
learning
the
art
in
order
to
take
it
away
with
them
and
this
we
can
prevent
but
we
surely
desire
to
keep
here
all
those
who
know
how
to
practise
it
for
the
greater
advantage
of
our
commerce
with
other
nations
that
is
the
intention
of
our
laws
assented
the
doge
your
highness
my
lords
cried
zorzi
who
had
taken
courage
from
what
the
councillor
had
said
if
this
law
is
not
made
for
such
as
i
am
i
entreat
you
to
grant
me
your
forgiveness
if
i
have
broken
it
and
make
it
impossible
for
me
to
break
it
again
my
lords
you
have
the
power
to
do
what
i
ask
i
beseech
you
that
i
may
be
permitted
to
work
at
my
art
as
if
i
were
a
venetian
and
even
to
keep
fires
in
a
small
furnace
of
my
own
as
other
workmen
may
when
they
have
saved
money
that
i
may
labour
to
the
honour
of
all
and
for
the
good
reputation
of
murano
this
is
what
i
most
humbly
ask
imploring
that
it
may
be
granted
to
me
but
always
according
to
your
good
pleasure
when
he
had
spoken
thus
asking
all
that
was
left
for
him
to
desire
and
amazed
at
his
own
boldness
he
was
silent
and
the
councillors
began
to
discuss
the
question
among
themselves
at
a
sign
from
the
chiefs
the
urn
into
which
the
votes
were
cast
was
brought
and
set
before
the
doge
for
all
was
decided
by
ballot
with
coloured
balls
and
no
man
knew
how
his
neighbour
voted
have
you
anything
more
to
say
asked
the
secretary
again
speaking
to
zorzi
i
have
said
all
save
to
thank
your
highness
and
your
lordships
with
all
my
heart
answered
the
dalmatian
withdraw
and
await
the
decision
of
the
supreme
council
zorzi
cast
one
more
glance
at
the
great
half
circle
of
venerable
men
at
their
velvet
robes
at
the
carved
wainscot
at
the
painted
vault
above
and
after
making
a
low
obeisance
he
found
his
way
to
the
door
outside
which
the
guards
were
waiting
they
took
him
back
to
a
cell
like
the
one
where
he
had
already
sat
so
long
but
which
was
reached
by
another
passage
for
everything
in
the
palace
was
so
disposed
as
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
one
prisoner
meeting
another
on
his
way
to
the
tribunal
or
coming
from
it
and
for
this
reason
the
bridge
of
sighs
which
was
then
not
yet
built
was
afterwards
made
to
contain
two
separate
passages
it
seemed
a
long
time
before
the
tread
of
guards
ceased
again
and
the
door
was
opened
and
zorzi
rose
as
quickly
as
he
could
when
he
saw
that
it
was
the
secretary
of
the
ten
who
entered
carrying
in
his
hand
a
document
which
had
a
seal
attached
to
it
your
prayer
is
granted
said
the
man
with
the
sharp
grey
eyes
by
this
patent
the
supreme
council
permits
you
to
set
up
a
furnace
of
your
own
in
murano
and
confers
upon
you
all
the
privileges
of
a
born
and
promises
you
especial
protection
if
any
one
shall
attempt
to
interfere
with
your
rights
zorzi
took
the
precious
parchment
eagerly
and
he
felt
the
hot
blood
rushing
to
his
face
as
he
tried
to
thank
the
secretary
but
in
a
moment
the
busy
personage
was
gone
after
speaking
a
word
to
the
guards
and
zorzi
heard
the
rustling
of
his
silk
gown
in
the
corridor
you
are
free
sir
said
one
of
the
guards
very
civilly
and
holding
the
door
open
zorzi
went
out
in
a
dream
finding
his
way
he
knew
not
how
as
he
received
a
word
of
direction
here
and
there
from
soldiers
who
guarded
the
staircases
when
he
was
aware
of
outer
things
he
was
standing
under
the
portico
that
surrounds
the
courtyard
of
the
ducal
palace
the
broad
parchment
was
unrolled
in
his
hands
and
his
eyes
were
puzzling
over
the
latin
words
and
the
unfamiliar
abbreviations
on
one
side
of
him
stood
old
beroviero
reading
over
his
shoulder
with
absorbed
interest
and
on
the
other
was
zuan
venier
glancing
at
the
document
with
the
careless
certainty
of
one
who
knows
what
to
expect
two
steps
away
pasquale
stood
in
his
best
clothes
and
his
clean
shirt
for
he
had
been
one
of
the
witnesses
and
he
was
firmly
planted
on
his
bowed
legs
his
long
arms
hanging
down
by
his
sides
his
little
red
eyes
were
fixed
on
zorzi
face
his
ugly
jaw
was
set
like
a
mastiff
and
his
extraordinary
face
seemed
cut
in
two
by
a
monstrous
smile
of
delight
it
seems
to
be
in
order
said
venier
politely
smothering
with
his
gloved
hand
the
beginning
of
a
yawn
i
owe
it
to
you
i
am
sure
answered
zorzi
turning
grateful
eyes
to
him
no
i
assure
you
said
the
patrician
but
i
daresay
it
has
made
us
all
change
our
opinion
of
the
ten
he
added
with
a
smile
let
me
come
and
see
you
at
work
at
your
own
furnace
before
long
i
have
always
wished
to
see
glass
blown
without
waiting
for
more
he
walked
quickly
away
waving
his
hand
after
he
had
already
turned
it
was
noon
when
zorzi
had
folded
his
patent
carefully
and
hidden
it
in
his
bosom
and
he
and
beroviero
and
pasquale
went
out
of
the
busy
gateway
under
the
outer
portico
beroviero
led
the
way
to
the
right
and
they
passed
saint
mark
in
the
blazing
sun
and
the
patriarch
palace
and
came
to
the
shady
landing
the
very
one
at
which
the
old
man
and
his
daughter
had
got
out
when
they
had
come
to
the
church
to
meet
contarini
the
gondola
was
waiting
there
and
beroviero
pushed
zorzi
gently
before
him
you
are
still
lame
he
said
get
in
first
and
sit
down
but
zorzi
drew
back
for
a
woman
hand
was
suddenly
thrust
out
of
the
little
window
of
the
with
a
quick
gesture
there
is
a
lady
inside
said
zorzi
marietta
is
in
the
gondola
answered
beroviero
with
a
smile
she
would
not
stay
at
home
but
there
is
room
for
us
all
get
in
my
son
note
the
story
of
zorzi
ballarin
and
marietta
beroviero
is
not
mere
fiction
and
is
told
in
several
ways
the
most
common
account
of
the
circumstances
assumes
that
zorzi
actually
stole
the
secrets
which
angelo
beroviero
had
received
from
paolo
godi
and
thereby
forced
angelo
to
give
him
his
daughter
in
marriage
but
the
learned
comm
levi
director
of
the
museum
in
murano
where
many
works
of
beroviero
and
ballarin
are
preserved
has
established
the
latter
reputation
for
honourable
dealing
with
regard
to
the
precious
secrets
in
a
pamphlet
entitled
del
vetro
in
murano
published
in
venice
in
to
which
i
beg
to
refer
the
curious
reader
i
have
used
a
privilege
in
writing
a
story
which
does
not
pretend
to
be
historical
i
have
taken
eleven
years
from
the
date
on
which
giovanni
beroviero
wrote
his
letter
to
the
podestà
of
murano
and
the
letter
itself
though
similar
in
spirit
to
the
original
is
differently
worded
and
covers
somewhat
different
ground
i
have
also
represented
zorzi
as
standing
alone
in
his
attempt
to
become
an
independent
whereas
comm
levi
has
discovered
that
he
had
two
companions
who
were
dalmatians
like
himself
there
is
no
foundation
in
tradition
for
the
existence
of
arisa
the
georgian
slave
but
it
is
well
known
that
beautiful
eastern
slaves
were
bought
and
sold
in
venice
and
in
many
other
parts
of
italy
even
at
a
much
later
date
