the
merry

save
the
green
meadows
old
mother
west
wind
family
is
very
big
very
big
indeed
there
are
dozens
and
dozens
of
merry
little
breezes
all
children
of
old
mother
west
wind
every
morning
she
comes
down
from
the
purple
hills
and
tumbles
them
out
of
a
great
bag
on
to
the
green
meadows
every
night
she
gathers
them
into
the
great
bag
and
putting
it
over
her
shoulder
takes
them
to
their
home
behind
the
purple
hills
one
morning
just
as
usual
old
mother
west
wind
turned
the
merry
little
breezes
out
to
play
on
the
green
meadows
then
she
hurried
away
to
fill
the
sails
of
the
ships
and
blow
them
across
the
great
ocean
the
merry
little
breezes
hopped
and
skipped
over
the
green
meadows
looking
for
some
one
to
play
with
it
was
then
that
one
of
them
discovered
something
something
very
dreadful
it
was
a
fire
yes
sir
it
was
a
fire
in
the
meadow
grass
some
one
had
dropped
a
lighted
match
and
now
little
red
flames
were
running
through
the
grass
in
all
directions
the
merry
little
breeze
hastened
to
tell
all
the
other
little
breezes
and
all
rushed
over
as
fast
as
they
could
to
see
for
themselves
they
saw
how
the
little
red
flames
were
turning
to
smoke
and
ashes
everything
they
touched
and
how
black
and
ugly
with
nothing
alive
there
became
that
part
of
the
green
meadows
where
the
little
flames
ran
it
was
dreadful
then
one
of
them
noticed
that
the
little
red
flames
were
running
in
the
direction
of
johnny
chuck
new
house
would
the
little
red
flames
burn
up
johnny
chuck
as
they
burned
up
the
grass
and
the
flowers
hi
cried
the
merry
little
breeze
we
must
warn
johnny
chuck
and
all
the
other
little
meadow
people
so
he
caught
up
a
capful
of
smoke
and
raced
off
as
fast
as
he
could
go
to
johnny
chuck
house
then
each
of
the
merry
little
breezes
caught
up
a
capful
of
smoke
and
started
to
warn
one
of
the
little
meadow
people
or
forest
folks
so
pretty
soon
jolly
round
red
sun
looking
down
from
the
blue
sky
saw
johnny
chuck
jimmy
skunk
peter
rabbit
striped
chipmunk
danny
meadow
mouse
reddy
fox
bobby
coon
happy
jack
squirrel
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
jumper
the
hare
and
old
toad
all
hurrying
as
fast
as
they
could
to
the
smiling
pool
where
live
billy
mink
and
little
joe
otter
and
jerry
muskrat
and
spotty
the
turtle
and
grandfather
frog
there
they
would
be
quite
safe
from
the
little
red
flames
oh
gasped
johnny
chuck
puffing
very
hard
for
you
know
he
is
round
and
fat
and
and
it
was
hard
work
for
him
to
run
what
will
become
of
my
nice
new
house
and
what
will
there
be
left
to
eat
the
merry
little
breeze
who
had
brought
him
the
warning
in
a
capful
of
smoke
thought
for
a
minute
then
he
called
all
the
other
little
breezes
to
him
we
must
get
farmer
brown
help
or
we
will
have
no
beautiful
green
meadows
to
play
on
said
the
merry
little
breeze
so
together
they
rushed
back
to
where
the
little
red
flames
had
grown
into
great
angry
red
flames
that
were
licking
up
everything
in
their
way
the
merry
little
breezes
gathered
a
great
cloud
of
smoke
and
lifting
all
together
they
carried
it
over
and
dropped
it
in
farmer
brown
dooryard
then
one
of
them
blew
a
little
of
the
smoke
in
at
an
open
window
near
which
farmer
brown
was
eating
breakfast
farmer
brown
coughed
and
strangled
and
sprang
from
his
chair
phew
cried
farmer
brown
i
smell
smoke
there
must
be
a
fire
on
the
meadows
then
he
shouted
for
his
boy
and
for
his
hired
man
and
the
three
with
shovels
in
their
hands
started
for
the
green
meadows
to
try
to
put
the
fire
out
the
merry
little
breezes
sighed
with
relief
and
followed
to
the
fire
but
when
they
saw
how
fierce
and
angry
the
red
flames
had
become
they
knew
that
farmer
brown
and
his
boy
and
his
hired
man
would
not
be
able
to
put
the
fire
out
choking
with
smoke
they
hurried
over
to
tell
the
dreadful
news
to
the
little
meadow
people
and
forest
folks
gathered
at
the
smiling
pool
why
do
you
help
put
the
fire
out
asked
grandfather
frog
we
warned
farmer
brown
and
his
boy
and
his
hired
man
what
more
can
we
do
asked
one
of
the
merry
little
breezes
go
find
and
drive
up
a
rain
cloud
replied
grandfather
frog
splendid
cried
all
the
little
meadow
people
and
forest
folks
hurry
hurry
oh
do
hurry
so
the
merry
little
breezes
scattered
in
all
directions
to
hunt
for
a
rain
cloud
it
is
a
good
thing
that
old
mother
west
wind
has
such
a
big
family
said
grandfather
frog
for
one
of
them
is
sure
to
find
a
wandering
rain
cloud
somewhere
then
all
the
little
meadow
people
and
forest
folks
sat
down
around
the
smiling
pool
to
wait
they
watched
the
smoke
roll
up
until
it
hid
the
face
of
jolly
round
red
sun
their
hearts
almost
stood
still
with
fear
as
they
saw
the
fierce
angry
red
flames
leap
into
the
air
and
climb
tall
trees
on
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
splash
something
struck
in
the
smiling
pool
right
beside
grandfather
frog
big
green
spat
something
hit
johnny
chuck
right
on
the
end
of
his
funny
little
black
nose
they
were
drops
of
water
hurrah
cried
johnny
chuck
whirling
about
sure
enough
they
were
drops
of
water
rain
drops
and
there
coming
just
as
fast
as
the
merry
little
breezes
could
push
it
and
they
were
pushing
very
hard
very
hard
indeed
was
a
great
black
rain
cloud
spilling
down
rain
as
it
came
when
it
was
just
over
the
fire
the
great
black
rain
cloud
split
wide
open
and
the
water
poured
down
so
that
the
fierce
angry
red
flames
were
drowned
in
a
few
minutes
phew
said
farmer
brown
mopping
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
that
was
warm
work
that
shower
came
up
just
in
time
and
it
is
lucky
it
did
but
you
know
and
i
know
and
all
the
little
meadow
people
and
forest
folks
know
that
it
was
luck
at
all
but
the
quick
work
and
hard
work
of
old
mother
west
wind
big
family
of
merry
little
breezes
which
saved
the
green
meadows
and
this
too
is
one
reason
why
peter
rabbit
and
johnny
chuck
and
bobby
coon
and
all
the
other
little
meadow
and
forest
people
love
the
merry
little
breezes
who
play
every
day
on
the
green
meadows
ii
the
stranger
in
the
green
forest
old
mother
west
wind
hurrying
down
from
the
purple
hills
with
her
merry
little
breezes
discovered
the
newcomer
in
the
green
forest
on
the
edge
of
the
green
meadows
of
course
the
merry
little
breezes
saw
him
too
and
as
soon
as
old
mother
west
wind
had
turned
them
loose
on
the
green
meadows
they
started
out
to
spread
the
news
as
they
hurried
along
the
crooked
little
path
up
the
hill
they
met
reddy
fox
oh
reddy
fox
cried
the
merry
little
breezes
so
excited
that
all
talked
together
there
a
stranger
in
the
green
forest
reddy
fox
sat
down
and
grinned
at
the
merry
little
breezes
the
grin
of
reddy
fox
is
not
pleasant
it
irritates
and
exasperates
it
made
the
merry
little
breezes
feel
very
uncomfortable
you
do
say
so
drawled
reddy
fox
do
you
mean
to
say
that
just
discovered
him
why
your
news
is
so
old
that
it
is
stale
it
is
no
news
at
all
i
thought
you
had
something
really
new
to
tell
me
the
merry
little
breezes
were
disappointed
their
faces
fell
they
had
thought
it
would
be
such
fun
to
carry
the
news
through
the
green
forest
and
over
the
green
meadows
and
now
the
very
first
one
they
met
knew
all
about
it
who
is
he
reddy
fox
asked
one
of
the
merry
little
breezes
reddy
fox
pretended
not
to
hear
i
must
be
going
said
he
rising
and
stretching
i
have
an
engagement
with
billy
mink
down
at
the
smiling
pool
reddy
fox
started
down
the
crooked
little
path
while
the
merry
little
breezes
hurried
up
the
crooked
little
path
to
tell
the
news
to
jimmy
skunk
who
was
looking
for
beetles
for
his
breakfast
now
reddy
fox
had
not
told
the
truth
he
had
known
nothing
whatever
of
the
stranger
in
the
green
forest
in
fact
he
had
been
as
surprised
as
the
merry
little
breezes
could
have
wished
but
he
would
not
show
it
and
he
had
told
another
untruth
for
he
had
no
intention
of
going
down
to
the
smiling
pool
no
indeed
he
just
waited
until
the
merry
little
breezes
were
out
of
sight
then
he
slipped
into
the
green
forest
to
look
for
the
stranger
seen
by
the
merry
little
breezes
now
reddy
fox
does
nothing
openly
instead
of
walking
through
the
green
forest
like
a
gentleman
he
sneaked
along
under
the
bushes
and
crept
from
tree
to
tree
all
the
time
looking
for
the
stranger
of
whom
the
merry
little
breezes
had
told
him
all
around
through
the
green
forest
sneaked
reddy
fox
but
nothing
of
the
stranger
could
he
see
it
occur
to
him
to
look
anywhere
but
on
the
ground
i
do
believe
there
is
a
stranger
here
said
reddy
to
himself
just
then
he
noticed
some
scraps
of
bark
around
the
foot
of
a
tall
maple
looking
up
to
see
where
it
came
from
he
saw
what
do
you
think
why
the
stranger
who
had
come
to
the
green
forest
reddy
fox
dodged
back
out
of
sight
for
he
wanted
to
find
out
all
he
could
about
the
stranger
before
the
stranger
saw
him
reddy
sat
down
behind
a
big
stump
and
rubbed
his
eyes
he
could
hardly
believe
what
he
saw
there
at
the
top
of
the
tall
maple
stripping
the
branches
of
their
bark
and
eating
it
was
the
stranger
sure
enough
he
was
big
much
bigger
than
reddy
could
he
be
a
relative
of
happy
jack
squirrel
he
did
look
a
bit
not
the
least
little
bit
like
happy
jack
and
he
moved
slowly
very
slowly
indeed
while
happy
jack
and
his
cousins
move
quickly
reddy
decided
that
the
stranger
could
not
be
related
to
happy
jack
the
longer
reddy
looked
the
more
he
was
puzzled
also
reddy
began
to
feel
just
a
little
bit
jealous
you
see
all
the
little
meadow
people
and
forest
folks
are
afraid
of
reddy
fox
but
this
stranger
was
so
big
that
reddy
began
to
feel
something
very
like
fear
in
his
own
heart
the
merry
little
breezes
had
told
the
news
to
jimmy
skunk
and
then
hurried
over
the
green
meadows
telling
every
one
they
met
of
the
stranger
in
the
green
forest
billy
mink
little
joe
otter
johnny
chuck
peter
rabbit
happy
jack
squirrel
danny
meadow
mouse
striped
chipmunk
old
toad
grandfather
frog
sammy
jay
blacky
the
crow
and
each
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
news
started
for
the
green
forest
to
welcome
the
newcomer
even
grandfather
frog
left
his
beloved
big
green
and
started
for
the
green
forest
so
it
was
that
when
finally
the
stranger
decided
that
he
had
eaten
enough
bark
for
his
breakfast
and
climbed
slowly
down
the
tall
maple
he
found
all
the
little
meadow
people
and
forest
folks
sitting
in
a
big
circle
waiting
for
him
the
stranger
was
anything
but
handsome
but
his
size
filled
them
with
respect
the
nearer
he
got
to
the
ground
the
bigger
he
looked
down
he
came
and
reddy
fox
noting
how
slow
and
clumsy
in
his
movements
was
the
stranger
decided
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
if
the
stranger
was
slow
and
clumsy
in
the
tree
he
was
clumsier
still
on
the
ground
his
eyes
were
small
and
dull
his
coat
was
rough
long
and
almost
black
his
legs
were
short
and
stout
his
tail
was
rather
short
and
broad
altogether
he
was
anything
but
handsome
but
when
the
little
meadow
people
and
forest
folks
saw
his
huge
front
teeth
they
regarded
him
with
greater
respect
than
ever
all
but
reddy
fox
reddy
strutted
out
in
front
of
him
who
are
you
he
demanded
illustration
reddy
strutted
out
in
front
of
him
who
are
you
he
demanded
the
stranger
paid
no
attention
to
reddy
fox
what
business
have
you
in
our
green
forest
demanded
reddy
showing
all
his
teeth
the
stranger
just
grunted
and
appeared
not
to
see
reddy
fox
reddy
swelled
himself
out
until
every
hair
stood
on
end
and
he
looked
twice
as
big
as
he
really
is
he
strutted
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
stranger
do
you
know
that
i
afraid
of
nothing
and
nobody
snarled
reddy
fox
the
stranger
refused
to
give
him
so
much
as
a
glance
he
just
grunted
and
kept
right
on
about
his
business
all
the
little
meadow
people
and
forest
folks
began
to
giggle
and
then
to
laugh
reddy
knew
that
they
were
laughing
at
him
and
he
grew
very
angry
for
no
one
likes
to
be
laughed
at
least
of
all
reddy
fox
you
a
pig
taunted
reddy
you
afraid
to
fight
i
bet
afraid
of
danny
meadow
mouse
still
the
stranger
just
grunted
and
paid
no
further
attention
to
reddy
fox
now
with
all
his
boasting
reddy
fox
had
kept
at
a
safe
distance
from
the
stranger
happy
jack
squirrel
had
noticed
this
if
you
so
brave
why
do
you
drive
him
out
reddy
fox
asked
happy
jack
skipping
behind
a
tree
you
do
dare
to
reddy
turned
and
glared
at
happy
jack
i
not
afraid
he
shouted
i
not
afraid
of
anything
nor
anybody
but
though
he
spoke
so
bravely
it
was
noticed
that
he
went
no
nearer
the
stranger
now
it
happened
that
that
morning
bowser
the
hound
took
it
into
his
head
to
take
a
walk
in
the
green
forest
blacky
the
crow
sitting
on
the
of
a
big
pine
was
the
first
to
see
him
coming
from
pure
love
of
mischief
blacky
waited
until
bowser
was
close
to
the
circle
around
the
stranger
then
he
gave
the
alarm
here
bowser
the
hound
run
screamed
blacky
the
crow
then
he
laughed
so
that
he
had
to
hold
his
sides
to
see
the
fright
down
below
reddy
fox
forgot
that
he
was
afraid
of
nothing
and
nobody
he
was
the
first
one
out
of
sight
running
so
fast
that
his
feet
seemed
hardly
to
touch
the
ground
peter
rabbit
turned
a
back
somersault
and
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
important
business
down
on
the
green
meadows
johnny
chuck
dodged
into
a
convenient
hole
billy
mink
ran
into
a
hollow
tree
striped
chipmunk
hid
in
an
old
stump
happy
jack
squirrel
climbed
the
nearest
tree
in
a
twinkling
the
stranger
was
alone
facing
bowser
the
hound
bowser
stopped
and
looked
at
the
stranger
in
sheer
surprise
then
the
hair
on
the
back
of
his
neck
stood
on
end
and
he
growled
a
deep
ugly
growl
still
the
stranger
did
not
run
bowser
did
know
just
what
to
make
of
it
never
before
had
he
had
such
an
experience
could
it
be
that
the
stranger
was
not
afraid
of
him
bowser
walked
around
the
stranger
growling
fiercely
as
he
walked
the
stranger
turned
so
as
always
to
face
him
it
was
perplexing
and
very
provoking
it
really
seemed
as
if
the
stranger
had
no
fear
of
him
bow
wow
wow
cried
bowser
the
hound
in
his
deepest
voice
and
sprang
at
the
stranger
then
something
happened
so
surprising
that
blacky
the
crow
lost
his
balance
on
the
top
of
the
pine
where
he
was
watching
the
instant
that
bowser
sprang
the
stranger
rolled
himself
into
a
tight
round
ball
and
out
of
the
long
hair
of
his
coat
sprang
hundreds
of
sharp
little
yellowish
white
barbed
spears
the
stranger
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
huge
black
and
yellow
chestnut
burr
bowser
the
hound
was
as
surprised
as
blacky
the
crow
he
stopped
short
and
his
eyes
looked
as
if
they
would
pop
out
of
his
head
he
looked
so
puzzled
and
so
funny
that
happy
jack
squirrel
laughed
aloud
the
stranger
did
not
move
bowser
backed
away
and
began
to
circle
around
again
sniffing
and
snuffing
once
in
a
while
he
barked
still
the
stranger
did
not
move
for
all
the
sign
of
life
he
made
he
might
in
truth
have
been
a
giant
chestnut
burr
bowser
sat
down
and
looked
at
him
then
he
walked
around
to
the
other
side
and
sat
down
what
a
queer
thing
thought
bowser
what
a
very
queer
thing
bowser
took
a
step
nearer
then
he
took
another
step
nothing
happened
finally
bowser
reached
out
and
with
his
nose
gingerly
touched
the
prickly
ball
slap
the
stranger
tail
had
struck
bowser
full
in
the
face
bowser
yelled
with
pain
and
rolled
over
and
over
on
the
ground
sticking
in
his
tender
lips
were
a
dozen
sharp
little
spears
and
claw
and
rub
at
them
as
he
would
bowser
could
not
get
them
out
every
time
he
touched
them
he
yelped
with
pain
finally
he
gave
it
up
and
started
for
home
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
like
a
whipped
puppy
and
with
every
step
he
yelped
when
he
had
disappeared
and
his
yelps
had
died
away
in
the
distance
the
stranger
unrolled
the
sharp
little
spears
disappeared
in
the
long
hair
of
his
coat
and
just
as
if
nothing
at
all
had
happened
the
stranger
walked
slowly
over
to
a
tall
maple
and
began
to
climb
it
and
this
is
how
prickly
porky
the
porcupine
came
to
the
green
forest
and
won
the
respect
and
admiration
of
all
the
little
meadow
people
and
forest
folks
including
reddy
fox
since
that
day
no
one
has
tried
to
meddle
with
prickly
porky
or
his
business
iii
how
prickly
porky
got
his
quills
the
newcomer
in
the
green
forest
was
a
source
of
great
interest
to
the
merry
little
breezes
ever
since
they
had
seen
him
turn
himself
into
a
huge
prickly
ball
like
a
giant
chestnut
burr
and
with
a
slap
of
his
tail
send
bowser
the
hound
yelping
home
with
his
lips
stuck
full
of
little
barbed
spears
they
had
visited
the
green
forest
every
day
to
watch
prickly
porky
he
was
not
very
social
indeed
he
was
not
social
at
all
but
attended
strictly
to
his
own
business
which
consisted
chiefly
of
stripping
bark
from
the
trees
and
eating
it
never
had
the
merry
little
breezes
seen
such
an
appetite
already
that
part
of
the
green
forest
where
he
had
chosen
to
live
had
many
bare
stark
trees
killed
that
prickly
porky
the
porcupine
might
live
you
see
a
tree
can
not
live
without
bark
and
prickly
porky
had
stripped
them
clean
to
fill
his
stomach
but
if
prickly
porky
was
not
social
he
was
not
unfriendly
he
seemed
to
enjoy
having
the
merry
little
breezes
about
and
did
not
in
the
least
mind
having
them
rumple
up
the
long
hair
of
his
coat
to
feel
the
sharp
little
barbed
spears
underneath
some
of
these
were
so
loose
that
they
dropped
out
peter
rabbit
curiosity
led
him
to
examine
some
of
these
among
bits
of
bark
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
peter
wished
that
he
had
left
them
alone
one
of
the
sharp
little
barbs
pierced
his
tender
skin
and
peter
could
not
get
it
out
he
had
to
ask
johnny
chuck
to
do
it
for
him
and
it
had
hurt
dreadfully
after
that
the
little
meadow
people
and
forest
folks
held
prickly
porky
in
greater
respect
than
ever
and
left
him
severely
alone
which
was
just
what
he
seemed
to
want
one
morning
the
merry
little
breezes
failed
to
find
prickly
porky
in
the
green
forest
could
he
have
left
as
mysteriously
as
he
had
come
they
hurried
down
to
the
smiling
pool
to
tell
grandfather
frog
bursting
through
the
bulrushes
on
the
edge
of
the
smiling
pool
they
nearly
upset
jerry
muskrat
who
was
sitting
on
an
old
log
intently
watching
something
out
in
the
middle
of
the
smiling
pool
it
was
prickly
porky
some
of
the
sharp
little
barbed
spears
were
standing
on
end
altogether
he
was
the
queerest
sight
the
smiling
pool
had
seen
for
a
long
time
he
was
swimming
easily
and
you
may
be
sure
no
one
tried
to
bother
him
little
joe
otter
and
billy
mink
sat
on
the
big
rock
and
for
once
they
had
forgotten
to
play
tricks
when
prickly
porky
headed
towards
the
big
rock
little
joe
otter
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
business
down
the
laughing
brook
and
billy
mink
recalled
that
mother
mink
had
forbidden
him
to
play
at
the
smiling
pool
prickly
porky
had
the
smiling
pool
quite
to
himself
when
he
had
swum
to
his
heart
content
he
climbed
out
shook
himself
and
slowly
ambled
up
the
lone
little
path
to
the
green
forest
the
merry
little
breezes
watched
him
out
of
sight
then
they
danced
over
to
the
big
green
on
which
sat
grandfather
frog
the
merry
little
breezes
are
great
favorites
with
grandfather
frog
as
usual
they
brought
him
some
foolish
green
flies
grandfather
frog
eyes
twinkled
as
he
snapped
up
the
last
foolish
green
fly
said
grandfather
frog
and
now
i
suppose
you
want
a
story
and
he
folded
his
hands
across
his
white
and
yellow
waistcoat
if
you
please
shouted
the
merry
little
breezes
if
you
please
do
tell
us
how
it
is
that
prickly
porky
has
spears
on
his
back
grandfather
settled
himself
comfortably
said
he
once
upon
a
time
when
the
world
was
young
porcupine
the
grandfather
a
thousand
times
removed
of
prickly
porky
whom
you
all
know
lived
in
the
green
forest
where
old
king
bear
ruled
porcupine
was
a
slow
clumsy
fellow
just
as
his
grandson
a
thousand
times
removed
is
he
was
so
slow
moving
and
when
he
tried
to
hurry
tumbled
over
himself
so
much
that
he
had
hard
work
to
get
enough
to
eat
always
some
one
reached
the
berry
patch
before
he
did
the
beetles
and
the
bugs
were
so
spry
that
seldom
could
he
catch
them
hunger
was
in
his
stomach
and
little
else
most
of
the
time
porcupine
grew
thin
and
thinner
and
still
more
thin
his
long
shaggy
coat
looked
twice
too
big
for
him
because
he
was
so
hungry
he
could
sleep
little
and
night
as
well
as
day
he
roamed
the
forest
thinking
of
nothing
but
his
empty
stomach
and
looking
for
something
to
put
in
it
so
he
learned
to
see
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
one
day
he
could
not
find
a
single
berry
and
not
a
beetle
or
a
bug
could
he
catch
he
was
so
hungry
that
he
sat
down
with
his
back
against
a
big
black
birch
and
clasping
both
hands
over
his
lean
stomach
he
wept
there
sister
south
wind
found
him
and
her
heart
was
moved
to
pity
for
she
knew
that
his
wits
were
as
slow
as
his
body
softly
she
stole
up
behind
him
the
bark
of
the
black
birch
it
sweet
and
good
whispered
sister
south
wind
then
she
hurried
on
her
way
porcupine
still
sat
with
his
hands
clasped
over
his
lean
stomach
for
it
took
a
long
time
for
his
slow
wit
to
understand
what
sister
south
wind
meant
bark
try
bark
said
porcupine
over
and
over
to
himself
he
rolled
his
dull
little
eyes
up
at
the
big
black
birch
believe
i
will
try
it
said
porcupine
at
last
slowly
he
turned
and
began
to
gnaw
the
bark
of
the
big
black
birch
it
was
tough
but
it
tasted
good
clumsily
he
began
to
climb
tearing
off
a
mouthful
of
bark
here
and
there
as
he
climbed
the
higher
he
got
the
tenderer
and
sweeter
the
bark
became
finally
he
reached
the
top
of
the
tree
and
there
on
the
small
branches
the
bark
was
so
tender
and
so
sweet
that
he
ate
and
ate
and
ate
until
for
the
first
time
in
many
days
porcupine
had
a
full
stomach
that
night
he
curled
up
in
a
hollow
log
and
slept
all
the
night
through
dreaming
of
great
forests
of
black
birch
and
all
he
wanted
to
eat
the
next
day
he
hunted
for
and
found
another
black
birch
and
climbing
to
the
top
he
ate
and
ate
until
his
stomach
was
full
from
that
time
on
porcupine
ceased
to
hunt
for
berries
or
beetles
or
bugs
he
grew
stout
and
stouter
he
filled
his
shaggy
coat
until
it
was
so
tight
it
threatened
to
burst
now
while
porcupine
was
so
thin
and
lean
he
had
no
enemies
but
when
he
grew
stout
and
then
fat
panther
and
fisher
and
bobcat
and
even
old
king
bear
began
to
cast
longing
eyes
upon
him
for
times
were
hard
and
they
were
hungry
porcupine
began
to
grow
afraid
by
night
he
hid
in
hollow
trees
and
by
day
he
went
abroad
to
eat
only
when
he
was
sure
that
no
one
bigger
than
himself
was
about
and
because
he
no
longer
dared
to
move
about
as
before
he
no
longer
depended
upon
the
black
birch
alone
but
learned
to
eat
and
to
like
all
kinds
of
bark
one
day
he
had
made
his
breakfast
on
the
bark
of
a
when
he
came
down
the
tree
he
brought
with
him
a
strip
of
bark
and
attached
to
it
were
some
of
the
long
thorns
with
which
the
seeks
to
protect
itself
when
he
reached
the
ground
whom
should
he
find
waiting
for
him
but
panther
panther
was
very
lean
and
very
hungry
for
hunting
had
been
poor
and
the
times
were
hard
morning
porcupine
said
panther
with
a
wicked
grin
fat
you
are
morning
panther
said
porcupine
politely
but
his
long
hair
stood
on
end
with
fright
as
he
looked
into
panther
cruel
yellow
eyes
say
how
fat
you
are
said
panther
licking
his
chops
and
showing
all
his
long
teeth
do
you
find
to
eat
these
hard
times
panther
just
bark
said
porcupine
while
his
teeth
chattered
with
fear
really
is
very
nice
and
sweet
wo
you
try
a
piece
mr
panther
porcupine
held
out
the
strip
of
locust
bark
which
he
had
brought
down
the
tree
for
his
lunch
now
panther
had
never
tried
bark
but
he
thought
to
himself
that
if
it
made
porcupine
so
fat
it
must
be
good
he
would
try
the
piece
of
bark
first
and
eat
porcupine
afterward
so
he
reached
out
and
snapped
up
the
strip
of
bark
now
the
locust
thorns
were
long
and
they
were
sharp
they
pierced
panther
tender
lips
and
his
tongue
they
stuck
in
the
roof
of
his
mouth
panther
spat
and
yelled
with
pain
and
rage
and
clawed
frantically
at
his
mouth
he
rolled
over
and
over
trying
to
get
rid
of
the
thorns
porcupine
did
stay
to
watch
him
for
once
in
his
life
he
hurried
by
the
time
panther
was
rid
of
the
last
thorn
porcupine
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
he
was
safely
hidden
inside
a
hollow
log
porcupine
did
sleep
that
night
he
just
lay
and
thought
and
thought
and
thought
the
next
morning
very
early
before
any
one
else
was
astir
he
started
out
to
call
on
old
mother
nature
morning
porcupine
what
brings
you
out
so
early
asked
old
mother
nature
porcupine
bowed
very
low
you
please
mother
nature
i
want
you
to
help
me
said
he
then
he
told
her
all
about
his
meeting
with
panther
and
how
helpless
he
was
when
he
met
his
enemies
and
he
begged
her
to
give
him
stout
claws
and
a
big
mouth
full
of
long
teeth
that
he
might
protect
himself
old
mother
nature
thought
a
few
minutes
porcupine
said
she
have
always
minded
your
own
business
you
do
not
know
how
to
fight
if
i
should
give
you
a
big
mouth
full
of
long
teeth
you
would
not
know
how
to
use
them
you
move
too
slowly
instead
i
will
give
you
a
thousand
little
spurs
they
shall
be
hidden
in
the
long
hair
of
your
coat
and
only
when
you
are
in
danger
shall
you
use
them
go
back
to
the
green
forest
and
the
next
time
you
meet
panther
or
fisher
or
bobcat
or
old
king
bear
roll
yourself
into
a
ball
and
the
thousand
little
spears
will
protect
you
now
go
porcupine
thanked
old
mother
nature
and
started
back
for
the
green
forest
once
he
stopped
to
smooth
down
his
long
rough
coat
sure
enough
there
under
the
long
hair
he
felt
a
thousand
little
spears
he
went
along
happily
until
suddenly
he
met
panther
yes
sir
he
met
panther
panther
was
feeling
very
ugly
for
his
mouth
was
sore
he
grinned
wickedly
when
he
saw
porcupine
and
stepped
right
out
in
front
of
him
all
the
time
licking
his
lips
porcupine
trembled
all
over
but
he
remembered
what
old
mother
nature
had
told
him
in
a
flash
he
had
rolled
up
into
a
tight
ball
sure
enough
the
thousand
little
spears
sprang
out
of
his
long
coat
and
he
looked
like
a
huge
chestnut
burr
panther
was
so
surprised
he
did
know
just
what
to
do
he
reached
out
a
paw
and
touched
porcupine
porcupine
was
nervous
he
switched
his
tail
around
and
it
struck
panther
paw
panther
yelled
for
there
were
spears
on
porcupine
tail
and
they
were
worse
than
the
locust
thorns
he
backed
away
hurriedly
and
limped
off
up
the
lone
little
path
growling
horribly
porcupine
waited
until
panther
was
out
of
sight
then
he
unrolled
and
slowly
and
happily
he
walked
back
to
his
home
in
the
green
forest
and
since
that
day
when
the
world
was
young
the
porcupines
have
feared
nothing
and
have
attended
strictly
to
their
own
business
and
that
is
how
they
happen
to
have
a
thousand
little
barbed
spears
which
are
called
quills
concluded
grandfather
frog
the
merry
little
breezes
drew
a
long
breath
thank
you
grandfather
frog
thank
you
ever
so
much
they
cried
all
together
we
are
going
back
now
to
tell
prickly
porky
that
we
know
all
about
his
little
spears
and
how
he
happens
to
have
them
but
first
they
blew
a
dozen
fat
foolish
green
flies
over
to

it
was

the

west

hurrying
down
from
the
purple
hills
across
the
green
meadows
stopped
long
enough
to
kiss
the
smiling
little
bluets
that
crowded
along
the
lone
little
path
all
up
and
down
the
laughing
brook
were
shy
violets
turning
joyful
faces
up
to
jolly
round
red
sun
johnny
chuck
was
sitting
on
his
doorstep
stretching
one
short
leg
and
then
another
to
get
the
kinks
out
after
his
long
long
winter
sleep
very
beautiful
very
beautiful
indeed
were
the
green
meadows
and
very
happy
were
all
the
little
meadow
people
all
but
peter
rabbit
who
sat
at
the
top
of
the
crooked
little
path
that
winds
down
the
hill
no
sir
peter
rabbit
peter
who
usually
carries
the
lightest
heart
on
the
green
meadows
was
not
happy
indeed
he
was
very
unhappy
as
he
sat
there
at
the
top
of
the
crooked
little
path
and
looked
down
on
the
green
meadows
he
saw
nothing
beautiful
at
all
because
why
because
his
big
soft
eyes
were
full
of
tears
splash
a
big
tear
fell
at
his
feet
in
the
crooked
little
path
splash
that
was
another
tear
splash
splash
my
gracious
my
gracious
what
the
matter
peter
rabbit
asked
a
gruff
voice
close
to
one
of
peter
long
ears
peter
jumped
then
he
winked
the
tears
back
and
looked
around
there
sat
old
toad
he
looked
very
solemn
very
solemn
indeed
he
was
wearing
a
shabby
old
suit
the
very
one
he
had
slept
in
all
winter
peter
forgot
his
troubles
long
enough
to
wonder
if
old
toad
would
swallow
his
old
clothes
when
he
got
a
new
suit
what
the
matter
peter
rabbit
what
the
matter
repeated
old
toad
peter
looked
a
little
foolish
he
hesitated
coughed
looked
this
way
and
looked
that
way
hitched
his
trousers
up
and
then
why
then
he
found
his
tongue
and
told
old
toad
all
his
troubles

peter
rabbit

and

and

peter
eyes
filled
with
tears
again
old
toad
rolled
one
eye
up
at
jolly
round
red
sun
and
winked
have
you
seen
grouse
and
mrs
pheasant
asked
old
toad

said
peter
rabbit
and
they
wo

quack
asked
old
toad
yes
said
peter
rabbit
and
she
says
she
ca
spare
a
single
one
old
toad
looked
very
thoughtful
he
scratched
the
tip
of
his
nose
with
his
left
hind
foot
then
he
winked
once
more
at
jolly
round
red
sun
have
you
been
to
see
jimmy
skunk
he
inquired
peter
rabbit
big
eyes
opened
very
wide
jimmy
skunk
he
exclaimed
jimmy
skunk
what
does
jimmy
skunk
have
to
do
with
eggs
old
toad
chuckled
deep
down
in
his
throat
he
chuckled
and
chuckled
until
he
shook
all
over
jimmy
skunk
knows
more
about
eggs
than
all
the
other
little
meadow
people
put
together
said
old
toad
you
take
my
advice
peter
rabbit
and
ask
jimmy
skunk
to
help
you
get
the
eggs
for
your
easter
egg
rolling
then
old
toad
picked
up
his
cane
and
started
down
the
crooked
little
path
to
the
green
meadows
there
he
found
the
merry
little
breezes
stealing
kisses
from
the
bashful
little
wind
flowers
old
toad
puffed
out
his
throat
and
pretended
that
he
disapproved
disapproved
very
much
indeed
but
at
the
same
time
he
rolled
one
eye
up
at
jolly
round
red
sun
and
winked
have
you
anything
better
to
do
than
make
bashful
little
flowers
hang
their
heads
asked
old
toad
gruffly
the
merry
little
breezes
stopped
their
dancing
and
gathered
about
old
toad
what
the
matter
with
you
this
morning
mr
toad
asked
one
of
them
do
you
want
us
to
go
find
a
breakfast
for
you
no
replied
old
toad
sourly
i
am
quite
able
to
get
breakfast
for
myself
but
peter
rabbit
is
up
on
the
hill
crying
because
he
can
not
find
any
eggs
crying
because
he
can
not
find
any
eggs
now
what
does
peter
rabbit
want
of
eggs
cried
the
merry
little
breezes
all
together
supposing
you
go
ask
him
replied
old
toad
tartly
once
more
picking
up
his
cane
and
starting
for
the
smiling
pool
to
call
on
his
cousin
grandfather
frog
the
merry
little
breezes
stared
after
him
for
a
few
minutes
then
they
started
in
a
mad
race
up
the
crooked
little
path
to
find
peter
rabbit
he
was
at
the
top
of
the
crooked
little
path
they
looked
everywhere
but
not
so
much
as
the
tip
of
one
of
his
long
ears
could
they
see
finally
they
met
him
just
coming
away
from
jimmy
skunk
house
peter
was
hopping
skipping
jumping
up
in
the
air
and
kicking
his
long
heels
as
only
peter
can
there
was
no
trace
of
tears
in
his
big
soft
eyes
plainly
peter
rabbit
was
in
good
spirits
in
the
very
best
of
spirits
when
he
saw
the
merry
little
breezes
he
jumped
twice
as
high
as
he
had
jumped
before
then
sat
up
very
straight
hello
said
peter
rabbit
hello
yourself
replied
the
merry
little
breezes
tell
us
what
under
the
sun
you
want
of
eggs
peter
rabbit
and
we
try
to
find
some
for
you
peter
eyes
sparkled
i
going
to
have
an
easter
egg
rolling
said
he
but
you

look
for
any
eggs
for
i
am
going
to
have
all
i
want
jimmy
skunk
has
promised
to
get
them
for
me
what
is
an
easter
egg
rolling
asked
the
merry
little
breezes
peter
looked
very
mysterious
wait
and
see
he
replied
then
a
sudden
thought
popped
into
his
head
will
you
do
something
for
me
he
asked
of
course
the
merry
little
breezes
were
delighted
to
do
anything
they
could
for
peter
rabbit
and
told
him
so
so
in
a
few
minutes
peter
had
them
scattering
in
every
direction
with
invitations
to
all
the
little
people
of
the
green
meadows
and
all
the
little
folks
of
the
green
forest
to
attend
his
egg
rolling
on
easter
morning
very
very
early
on
easter
morning
old
mother
west
wind
hurried
down
from
the
purple
hills
and
swept
all
the
rain
clouds
out
of
the
sky
jolly
round
red
sun
climbed
up
in
the
sky
smiling
his
broadest
all
the
little
song
birds
sang
their
sweetest
and
some
who
really
can
not
sing
at
all
tried
to
just
because
they
were
so
happy
across
the
beautiful
green
meadows
came
all
the
little
meadow
people
and
forest
folks
to
the
smooth
grassy
bank
where
the
big
hickory
grows
peter
rabbit
was
there
waiting
for
them
he
had
brushed
his
clothes
until
you
would
hardly
have
known
him
he
felt
very
much
excited
and
very
important
and
very
very
happy
for
this
was
to
be
the
very
first
egg
rolling
the
green
meadows
had
ever
known
and
it
was
all
his
very
own
hidden
behind
the
old
hickory
tucked
under
pieces
of
bark
scattered
among
the
bluets
and
wind
flowers
were
big
eggs
little
eggs
and
eggs
for
jimmy
skunk
had
been
true
to
his
promise
where
they
came
from
jimmy
would
tell
perhaps
if
old
gray
goose
and
quack
could
have
been
there
they
would
have
understood
why
it
took
so
long
to
fill
their
nests
perhaps
if
farmer
brown
boy
had
happened
along
he
would
have
guessed
why
he
had
to
hunt
so
long
in
the
barn
and
under
the
henhouse
to
get
enough
eggs
for
breakfast
but
jimmy
skunk
held
his
tongue
and
just
smiled
to
see
how
happy
peter
rabbit
was
first
came
peter
cousin
jumper
the
hare
then
up
from
the
smiling
pool
came
jerry
muskrat
little
joe
otter
billy
mink
grandfather
frog
and
spotty
the
turtle
johnny
chuck
danny
meadow
mouse
and
old
toad
came
together
of
course
reddy
fox
was
on
hand
promptly
striped
chipmunk
came
dancing
out
from
the
home
no
one
has
been
able
to
find
out
from
the
green
forest
trotted
bobby
coon
happy
jack
squirrel
and
chatterer
the
red
squirrel
behind
them
shuffled
prickly
porky
last
of
all
came
jimmy
skunk
who
never
hurries
and
jimmy
wore
his
very
best
suit
of
black
and
white
up
in
the
old
hickory
sat
blacky
the
crow
sammy
jay
and
drummer
the
woodpecker
to
watch
the
fun
when
all
had
arrived
peter
rabbit
started
them
to
hunting
for
the
eggs
everybody
got
in
the
way
of
everybody
else
even
old
toad
caught
the
excitement
and
hopped
this
way
and
hopped
that
way
hunting
for
eggs
danny
meadow
mouse
found
a
goose
egg
bigger
than
himself
and
had
to
get
help
to
bring
it
in
bobby
coon
stubbed
his
toes
and
fell
down
with
an
egg
under
each
arm
such
a
looking
sight
as
he
was
he
had
to
go
down
to
the
smiling
pool
to
by
and
by
when
all
the
eggs
had
been
found
peter
rabbit
sent
a
big
goose
egg
rolling
down
the
grassy
bank
and
then
raced
after
it
to
bring
it
back
and
roll
it
down
again
in
a
few
minutes
the
green
grassy
bank
was
covered
with
eggs
big
eggs
little
eggs
all
kinds
of
eggs
some
were
nearly
round
and
rolled
swiftly
to
the
bottom
some
were
sharp
pointed
at
one
end
and
rolled
crookedly
and
sometimes
turned
end
over
end
a
big
egg
knocked
johnny
chuck
legs
from
under
him
and
because
johnny
chuck
is
round
and
he
just
rolled
over
and
over
after
the
egg
clear
to
the
bottom
of
the
green
grassy
bank
and
it
was
such
fun
that
he
scrambled
up
and
did
it
all
over
again
then
bobby
coon
tried
it
pretty
soon
every
one
was
trying
it
even
reddy
fox
who
seldom
forgets
his
dignity
for
once
blacky
the
crow
and
sammy
jay
almost
wished
that
they
had
got
wings
so
that
they
might
join
in
the
fun
but
the
greatest
fun
of
all
was
when
prickly
porky
decided
that
he
too
would
join
in
the
rolling
he
tucked
his
head
down
in
his
vest
and
made
himself
into
a
perfectly
round
ball
now
when
he
did
this
all
his
hidden
spears
stood
out
straight
until
he
looked
like
a
great
giant
chestnut
burr
and
every
one
hurried
to
get
out
of
his
way
over
and
over
faster
and
faster
he
rolled
down
the
green
grassy
bank
until
he
landed
where
do
you
think
why
right
in
the
midst
of
a
lot
of
eggs
that
had
been
left
when
the
other
little
people
had
scampered
out
of
his
way
now
having
his
head
tucked
into
his
vest
prickly
porky
could
see
where
he
was
going
so
when
he
reached
the
bottom
and
hopped
to
his
feet
he
did
know
what
to
make
of
the
shout
that
went
up
from
all
the
little
meadow
people
so
foolish
prickly
porky
lost
his
temper
because
he
was
being
laughed
at
and
started
off
up
the
lone
little
path
to
his
home
in
the
green
forest
and
what
do
you
think
why
stuck
fast
in
a
row
on
the
spears
on
his
back
prickly
porky
carried
off
six
of
peter
rabbit
easter
eggs
and
did
know
it
v
how
johnny
chuck
ran
away
johnny
chuck
stood
on
the
doorstep
of
his
house
and
watched
old
chuck
start
down
the
lone
little
path
across
the
green
meadows
towards
farmer
brown
garden
she
had
her
market
basket
on
her
arm
and
johnny
knew
that
when
she
returned
it
would
be
full
of
the
things
he
liked
best
but
not
even
the
thought
of
these
could
chase
away
the
frown
that
darkened
johnny
chuck
face
he
had
never
been
to
farmer
brown
garden
and
he
had
begged
very
hard
to
go
that
morning
with
old
chuck
but
she
had
said
no
it
is
safe
for
such
a
little
chap
as
you
and
when
chuck
said
no
johnny
knew
that
she
meant
it
and
that
it
was
of
no
use
at
all
to
beg
so
he
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
scowled
and
scowled
as
he
thought
of
old
chuck
very
last
words
now
johnny
do
you
dare
put
a
foot
outside
of
the
yard
until
i
get
back
pretty
soon
along
came
peter
rabbit
peter
was
trying
to
jump
over
his
own
shadow
when
he
saw
johnny
chuck
he
stopped
abruptly
then
he
looked
up
at
the
blue
sky
and
winked
at
jolly
round
red
sun
looks
mighty
showery
here
he
remarked
to
no
one
in
particular
johnny
chuck
smiled
in
spite
of
himself
then
he
told
peter
rabbit
how
he
had
got
to
stay
at
home
and
mind
the
house
and
could
put
his
foot
outside
the
yard
now
peter
has
had
the
best
bringing
up
in
the
world
for
his
mother
has
such
a
big
family
that
she
is
kept
busy
just
getting
them
something
to
eat
so
peter
has
been
allowed
to
bring
himself
up
and
do
just
about
as
he
pleases
how
long
will
your
mother
be
gone
asked
peter
most
all
the
morning
said
johnny
chuck
mournfully
peter
hopped
a
couple
of
steps
nearer
say
johnny
he
whispered
how
is
she
going
to
know
whether
you
stay
in
the
yard
all
the
time
or
not
so
long
as
you
are
here
when
she
gets
home
i
know
where
there
the
dandiest
patch
we
can
go
over
there
and
back
easy
before
old
chuck
gets
home
and
she
wo
know
anything
about
it
come
on
johnny
chuck
mouth
watered
at
the
thought
of
the
but
still
he
hesitated
for
johnny
chuck
had
been
taught
to
mind
cat
cat
tied
to
your
mother
apron
strings
jeered
peter
rabbit
i
ai
either
cried
johnny
chuck
and
then
just
to
prove
it
he
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
swaggered
out
into
the
lone
little
path
where
your
old
clover
patch
asked
he
i
show
you
said
peter
rabbit
and
off
he
started
so
fast
that
johnny
chuck
lost
his
breath
trying
to
make
his
short
legs
keep
up
and
all
the
time
johnny
conscience
was
pricking
him
peter
rabbit
left
the
lone
little
path
across
the
green
meadows
for
some
secret
little
paths
of
his
own
his
long
legs
took
him
over
the
ground
very
fast
johnny
chuck
running
behind
him
grew
tired
and
hot
for
johnny
legs
are
short
and
he
is
fat
and
at
times
all
he
could
see
was
the
white
patch
on
the
seat
of
peter
rabbit
pants
he
began
to
wish
that
he
had
minded
old
chuck
and
stayed
at
home
it
was
too
late
to
go
back
now
for
he
did
know
the
way
wait
up
peter
rabbit
he
called
peter
rabbit
just
flirted
his
tail
and
ran
faster
please
please
wait
for
me
peter
rabbit
panted
johnny
chuck
and
began
to
cry
yes
sir
he
began
to
cry
you
see
he
was
so
hot
and
tired
and
then
he
was
so
afraid
that
he
would
lose
sight
of
peter
rabbit
if
he
did
he
would
surely
be
lost
and
then
what
should
he
do
the
very
thought
made
him
run
just
a
little
faster
illustration
please
please
wait
for
me
peter
rabbit
panted
johnny
chuck
now
peter
rabbit
is
really
one
of
the
little
fellows
in
the
world
just
and
careless
so
when
finally
he
looked
back
and
saw
johnny
chuck
way
way
behind
with
the
tears
running
down
his
cheeks
and
how
hot
and
tired
he
looked
peter
sat
down
and
waited
pretty
soon
johnny
chuck
came
up
puffing
and
blowing
and
threw
himself
flat
on
the
ground
please
peter
rabbit
is
it
very
much
farther
to
the
patch
he
panted
wiping
his
eyes
with
the
backs
of
his
hands
no
replied
peter
rabbit
just
a
little
way
more
we
rest
here
a
few
minutes
and
then
i
wo
run
so
fast
so
peter
rabbit
and
johnny
chuck
lay
down
in
the
grass
to
rest
while
johnny
chuck
recovered
his
breath
every
minute
or
two
peter
would
sit
up
very
straight
prick
up
his
long
ears
and
look
this
way
and
look
that
way
as
if
he
expected
to
see
something
unusual
it
made
johnny
chuck
nervous
what
do
you
keep
doing
that
for
peter
rabbit
he
asked
oh
nothin
replied
peter
rabbit
but
he
kept
right
on
doing
it
just
the
same
then
suddenly
after
one
of
these
looks
abroad
he
crouched
down
very
flat
and
whispered
in
johnny
chuck
ear
in
great
excitement
old
whitetail
is
down
here
and
he
headed
this
way
we
better
be
moving
he
said
johnny
chuck
felt
a
chill
of
fear
who
is
old
whitetail
he
asked
as
he
prepared
to
follow
peter
rabbit
do
you
know
asked
peter
in
surprise
say
you
are
green
why
he
marsh
hawk
and
if
he
once
gets
the
chance
he
gobble
you
up
skin
bones
and
all
there
an
old
stone
wall
just
a
little
way
from
here
and
the
sooner
we
get
there
the
better
peter
rabbit
led
the
way
and
if
he
had
run
fast
before
it
was
nothing
to
the
way
he
ran
now
a
great
fear
made
johnny
chuck
forget
that
he
was
tired
and
he
ran
as
he
had
never
run
before
in
all
his
short
life
just
as
he
dived
into
a
hole
between
two
big
stones
a
shadow
swept
over
the
grass
and
something
sharp
tore
a
gap
in
the
seat
of
his
pants
and
made
him
squeal
with
fright
and
pain
but
he
wriggled
in
beside
peter
rabbit
and
was
safe
while
marsh
hawk
flew
off
with
a
scream
of
rage
and
disappointment
johnny
chuck
had
never
been
so
frightened
in
all
his
short
life
he
made
himself
as
small
as
possible
and
crept
as
far
as
he
could
underneath
a
friendly
stone
in
the
old
wall
his
pants
were
torn
and
his
leg
smarted
dreadfully
where
one
of
marsh
hawk
cruel
sharp
claws
had
scratched
him
how
he
did
wish
that
he
had
minded
old
chuck
and
stayed
in
his
own
yard
as
she
had
told
him
to
peter
rabbit
looked
at
the
tear
in
johnny
chuck
pants
pooh
said
peter
rabbit
do
mind
a
little
thing
like
that
but
i
afraid
to
go
home
with
my
pants
torn
said
johnny
chuck
do
go
home
replied
peter
rabbit
i
do
unless
i
feel
like
it
you
stay
away
a
long
time
and
then
your
mother
will
be
so
glad
to
see
you
that
she
wo
ever
think
of
the
pants
johnny
chuck
looked
doubtful
but
before
he
could
say
anything
peter
rabbit
stuck
his
head
out
to
see
if
the
way
was
clear
it
was
and
peter
long
legs
followed
his
head
come
on
johnny
chuck
he
shouted
i
going
over
to
the
patch
but
johnny
chuck
was
afraid
he
was
almost
sure
that
old
whitetail
was
waiting
just
outside
to
gobble
him
up
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
would
put
so
much
as
the
tip
of
his
wee
black
nose
out
but
without
peter
rabbit
it
grew
lonesomer
and
lonesomer
in
under
the
old
stone
wall
besides
he
was
afraid
that
he
would
lose
peter
rabbit
and
then
he
would
be
lost
indeed
for
he
did
know
the
way
home
finally
johnny
chuck
ventured
to
peep
out
there
was
jolly
round
red
sun
smiling
down
just
as
if
he
was
used
to
seeing
little
runaway
chucks
every
day
johnny
looked
and
looked
for
peter
rabbit
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
saw
him
and
when
he
did
all
he
saw
were
peter
rabbit
funny
long
ears
above
the
tops
of
the
waving
grass
for
peter
rabbit
was
hidden
in
the
patch
eating
away
for
dear
life
it
was
only
a
little
distance
but
johnny
chuck
had
had
such
a
fright
that
he
tried
three
times
before
he
grew
brave
enough
to
scurry
through
the
tall
grass
and
join
peter
rabbit
my
how
good
that
did
taste
johnny
chuck
forgot
all
about
old
whitetail
he
forgot
all
about
his
torn
pants
he
forgot
that
he
had
run
away
and
did
know
the
way
home
he
just
ate
and
ate
and
ate
until
his
stomach
was
so
full
he
could
stuff
another
piece
of
into
it
suddenly
peter
rabbit
grabbed
him
by
a
sleeve
and
pulled
him
down
flat
said
peter
rabbit
do
move
johnny
chuck
heart
almost
stopped
beating
what
new
danger
could
there
be
now
in
a
minute
he
heard
a
queer
noise
peeping
between
the
stems
of
he
saw
what
do
you
think
why
old
chuck
cutting
to
put
in
the
basket
of
vegetables
she
was
taking
home
from
farmer
brown
garden
johnny
chuck
gave
a
great
sigh
of
relief
but
he
kept
very
still
for
he
did
not
want
her
to
find
him
there
after
she
had
told
him
not
to
put
foot
outside
his
own
dooryard
you
wait
here
whispered
peter
rabbit
and
crept
off
through
the
clover
pretty
soon
johnny
chuck
saw
peter
rabbit
steal
up
behind
old
chuck
and
pull
four
big
lettuce
leaves
out
of
her
basket
vi
peter
rabbit
run
for
life
i
wish
i
had
run
away
said
johnny
chuck
dolefully
as
he
and
peter
rabbit
peeped
out
from
the
patch
and
watched
old
chuck
start
for
home
with
her
market
basket
on
her
arm
you
ought
to
think
yourself
lucky
that
your
mother
did
find
you
here
in
the
patch
if
it
had
been
for
me
she
would
have
said
peter
rabbit
johnny
chuck
face
grew
longer
and
longer
his
pants
were
torn
his
leg
was
stiff
and
sore
where
old
marsh
hawk
had
scratched
him
that
morning
but
worse
still
his
conscience
pricked
him
yes
sir
johnny
chuck
conscience
was
pricking
him
hard
very
hard
indeed
because
he
had
run
away
from
home
with
peter
rabbit
after
old
chuck
had
told
him
not
to
leave
the
yard
while
she
was
away
now
he
did
know
the
way
home
peter
rabbit
i
want
to
go
home
said
johnny
chuck
suddenly
there
a
short
cut
so
that
i
can
get
home
before
my
mother
does
no
there
is
said
peter
rabbit
and
if
there
was
what
good
would
it
do
you
old
chuck
would
see
that
tear
in
your
pants
and
then
you
catch
it
i
do
care
please
wo
you
show
me
the
way
home
peter
rabbit
begged
johnny
chuck
peter
rabbit
yawned
lazily
as
he
replied
what
the
use
of
going
now
you
catch
it
anyway
so
you
might
as
well
stay
and
have
all
fun
you
can
say
i
know
a
dandy
old
house
up
on
the
hill
jimmy
skunk
used
to
live
there
but
no
one
lives
in
it
now
let
go
up
and
see
it
it
a
dandy
place
now
right
down
in
his
heart
johnny
chuck
knew
that
he
ought
to
go
home
but
he
could
go
unless
peter
rabbit
would
show
him
the
way
and
then
he
did
want
to
see
that
old
house
perhaps
peter
rabbit
was
right
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
he
was
and
he
had
better
have
all
the
fun
he
could
so
johnny
chuck
followed
peter
rabbit
up
the
hill
to
the
old
house
of
jimmy
skunk
cobwebs
covered
the
doorway
johnny
chuck
was
going
to
brush
them
away
but
peter
rabbit
stopped
him
let
see
if
there
is
a
back
door
said
he
then
we
can
use
that
and
if
bowser
the
hound
or
farmer
brown
boy
comes
along
and
finds
this
door
they
think
no
one
ever
lives
here
any
more
and
you
be
safer
than
if
you
were
right
in
your
own
home
so
they
hunted
and
hunted
and
by
and
by
johnny
chuck
found
the
back
door
way
off
at
one
side
and
cunningly
hidden
under
a
tangle
of
grass
inside
was
a
long
dark
hall
and
at
the
end
of
that
a
nice
big
room
it
was
very
dirty
and
johnny
chuck
who
is
very
neat
at
once
began
to
clean
house
and
soon
had
it
spick
and
span
suddenly
they
heard
a
voice
outside
the
front
door
does
look
as
if
anybody
lives
here
but
seems
as
if
i
smell
young
rabbit
and
yes
i
sure
i
smell
young
chuck
too
guess
i
have
a
look
inside
it
old
granny
fox
whispered
peter
rabbit
trembling
with
fright
then
peter
rabbit
did
a
very
brave
thing
he
remembered
that
johnny
chuck
could
not
run
very
fast
and
that
if
it
had
been
for
him
johnny
chuck
would
be
safe
at
home
you
stay
right
here
whispered
peter
rabbit
then
he
slipped
out
the
back
door
down
the
hill
he
stopped
and
shouted
old
granny
fox
is
slower
than
an
ox
then
he
started
for
the
old
brier
patch
as
fast
as
his
long
legs
could
take
him
and
after
him
ran
granny
fox
peter
rabbit
was
running
for
his
life
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
right
behind
him
grinding
her
long
white
teeth
her
eyes
snapping
ran
old
granny
fox
peter
rabbit
did
not
like
to
think
what
would
happen
to
him
if
she
should
catch
him
peter
rabbit
was
used
to
running
for
his
life
he
had
to
do
it
at
least
once
every
day
but
usually
he
was
near
a
safe
hiding
place
and
he
rather
enjoyed
the
excitement
this
time
however
the
only
place
of
safety
he
could
think
of
was
the
friendly
old
brier
patch
and
that
was
a
long
way
off
back
at
the
old
house
on
the
hill
where
granny
fox
had
discovered
peter
rabbit
was
little
johnny
chuck
trembling
with
fright
he
crept
to
the
back
door
of
the
old
house
to
watch
he
saw
granny
fox
getting
nearer
and
nearer
to
peter
rabbit
oh
dear
oh
dear
she
catch
peter
rabbit
she
catch
peter
rabbit
wailed
johnny
chuck
wringing
his
hands
in
despair
it
certainly
looked
as
if
granny
fox
would
she
was
right
at
peter
rabbit
heels
poor
little
peter
rabbit
two
more
jumps
and
granny
fox
would
have
him
johnny
chuck
shut
his
eyes
tight
for
he
did
want
to
see
but
peter
rabbit
had
no
intention
of
being
caught
so
easily
while
he
had
seemed
to
be
running
his
very
hardest
really
he
was
not
and
all
the
time
he
was
watching
granny
fox
for
peter
rabbit
big
eyes
are
so
placed
that
he
can
see
behind
him
without
turning
his
head
so
he
knew
when
granny
fox
was
near
enough
to
catch
him
in
one
more
jump
then
peter
rabbit
dodged
yes
sir
peter
rabbit
dodged
like
a
flash
and
away
he
went
in
another
direction
as
fast
as
he
could
go
old
granny
fox
had
been
so
sure
that
in
another
minute
she
would
have
tender
young
rabbit
for
her
dinner
that
she
had
begun
to
smile
and
her
mouth
actually
watered
she
did
not
see
where
she
was
going
all
she
saw
was
the
white
patch
on
the
seat
of
peter
rabbit
trousers
bobbing
up
and
down
right
in
front
of
her
nose
when
peter
rabbit
dodged
something
surprising
happened
johnny
chuck
who
had
opened
his
eyes
to
see
if
all
was
over
jumped
up
and
shouted
for
joy
and
did
a
funny
little
dance
in
the
doorway
of
the
old
house
on
the
hill
peter
had
dodged
right
in
front
of
a
wire
fence
a
fence
with
ugly
sharp
barbs
and
right
smack
into
it
ran
granny
fox
it
scratched
her
face
and
tore
her
bright
red
cloak
it
threw
her
back
flat
on
the
ground
with
all
the
wind
knocked
out
of
her
body
when
finally
she
had
gotten
her
breath
and
scrambled
to
her
feet
peter
rabbit
was
almost
over
to
the
friendly
old
brier
patch
he
stopped
and
sat
up
very
straight
then
he
put
his
hands
on
his
hips
and
shouted
run
granny
run
here
comes
a
man
who
got
a
gun
granny
fox
started
nervously
and
looked
this
way
and
looked
that
way
there
was
no
one
in
sight
then
she
shook
a
fist
at
peter
rabbit
and
started
to
limp
off
home
johnny
chuck
gave
a
great
sigh
of
relief
my
said
he
i
wish
i
was
as
smart
as
peter
rabbit
you
will
be
if
you
live
long
enough
said
a
voice
right
behind
him
it
was
old
toad
toad
and
johnny
chuck
sat
in
the
doorway
of
the
old
house
on
the
hill
and
watched
old
granny
fox
limp
off
home
i
wonder
what
it
would
seem
like
not
to
be
afraid
of
anything
in
the
whole
world
said
johnny
chuck
people
who
mind
their
own
business
and
do
get
into
mischief
need
to
be
afraid
of
anything
said
toad
johnny
chuck
remembered
how
safe
he
had
always
felt
at
home
with
old
chuck
and
how
many
times
and
how
badly
he
had
been
frightened
since
he
ran
away
that
morning
i
guess
perhaps
you
are
right
toad
said
johnny
chuck
doubtfully
of
course
i
right
replied
toad
of
course
i
right
look
at
me
i
attend
strictly
to
my
own
affairs
and
no
one
ever
bothers
me
that
because
you
are
so
homely
that
no
one
wants
you
for
a
dinner
when
he
can
find
anything
else
said
peter
rabbit
who
had
come
up
from
the
friendly
old
brier
patch
better
be
homely
than
to
need
eyes
in
the
back
of
my
head
to
keep
my
skin
whole
retorted
toad
now
i
do
know
what
it
is
to
be
afraid
not
of
old
granny
fox
asked
johnny
chuck
no
said
toad
nor
bowser
the
hound
no
said
toad
he
a
friend
of
mine
then
toad
swelled
himself
up
very
big
i
not
afraid
of
anything
under
the
sun
boasted
toad
peter
rabbit
looked
at
johnny
chuck
and
slowly
winked
one
eye
i
guess
i
go
up
the
hill
and
have
a
look
around
said
peter
rabbit
hitching
up
his
trousers
so
peter
rabbit
went
off
up
the
hill
while
toad
smoothed
down
his
dingy
white
waistcoat
and
told
johnny
chuck
what
a
foolish
thing
fear
is
by
and
by
there
was
a
queer
rustling
in
the
grass
back
of
them
toad
hopped
around
awkwardly
what
was
that
he
whispered
just
the
wind
in
the
grass
i
guess
said
johnny
chuck
for
a
while
all
was
still
and
toad
settled
himself
comfortably
and
began
to
talk
once
more
no
sir
said
toad
i
not
afraid
of
anything
just
then
there
was
another
rustle
in
the
grass
a
little
nearer
than
before
toad
certainly
was
nervous
he
stretched
up
on
the
tips
of
his
toes
and
looked
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
then
toad
turned
pale
yes
sir
toad
actually
turned
pale
his
big
bulging
eyes
looked
as
if
they
would
pop
out
of
his
head
i
i
must
be
going
said
toad
hastily
i
quite
forgot
an
important
engagement
down
on
the
green
meadows
if
blacksnake
should
happen
to
call
do
mention
that
you
have
seen
me
will
you
johnny
chuck
johnny
chuck
looked
over
in
the
grass
something
long
and
slim
and
black
was
wriggling
through
it
when
he
turned
about
again
toad
was
down
the
hill
going
with
such
big
hops
that
three
times
he
fell
flat
on
his
face
and
when
he
picked
himself
up
he
did
even
stop
to
brush
off
his
clothes
i
wonder
what
it
seems
like
not
to
be
afraid
of
anything
in
the
world
said
a
voice
right
behind
johnny
chuck
there
stood
peter
rabbit
laughing
so
that
he
had
to
hold
his
sides
and
in
one
hand
was
the
end
of
an
old
leather
strap
which
he
had
fooled
toad
into
thinking
was
blacksnake
vii
a
joker
fooled
peter
rabbit
and
johnny
chuck
sat
in
the
doorway
of
jimmy
deserted
old
house
on
the
hill
and
looked
down
across
the
green
meadows
every
few
minutes
peter
rabbit
would
chuckle
as
he
thought
of
how
he
had
fooled
toad
into
thinking
that
an
old
leather
strap
was
blacksnake
is
blacksnake
so
very
dangerous
asked
johnny
chuck
who
had
seen
very
little
of
the
world
not
for
you
or
me
replied
peter
rabbit
because
we
grown
too
big
for
him
to
swallow
but
he
would
like
nothing
better
than
to
catch
toad
for
his
dinner
but
if
you
ever
meet
blacksnake
be
polite
to
him
he
is
very
quick
tempered
is
blacksnake
but
if
you
bother
him
he
not
bother
you
my
goodness
i
wonder
what
going
on
down
there
in
the
alders
johnny
chuck
looked
over
to
the
alder
thicket
he
saw
sammy
jay
blacky
the
crow
and
redwing
sitting
in
the
alders
they
were
calling
back
and
forth
apparently
very
much
excited
peter
rabbit
looked
this
way
and
that
way
to
see
if
the
coast
was
clear
come
on
johnny
chuck
let
go
down
and
see
what
the
trouble
is
said
he
for
you
know
peter
rabbit
has
a
great
deal
of
curiosity
so
down
to
the
alder
thicket
skipped
peter
rabbit
and
johnny
chuck
as
fast
as
they
could
go
there
they
were
joined
by
danny
meadow
mouse
for
he
too
had
heard
the
fuss
and
wanted
to
know
what
it
all
meant
what
the
matter
asked
peter
rabbit
of
sammy
jay
but
sammy
was
too
excited
to
answer
and
simply
pointed
down
into
the
middle
of
the
alder
thicket
so
the
three
of
them
one
behind
the
other
very
softly
crept
in
among
the
alders
a
great
commotion
was
going
on
among
the
dead
leaves
danny
meadow
mouse
gave
one
look
then
he
turned
as
pale
as
did
toad
when
peter
rabbit
fooled
him
with
the
old
leather
strap
this
is
no
place
for
me
exclaimed
danny
meadow
mouse
and
started
for
home
as
fast
as
he
could
run
partly
under
an
old
log
lay
blacksnake
there
seemed
to
be
something
the
matter
with
him
he
looked
sick
and
threshed
and
struggled
till
he
made
the
leaves
fly
sammy
jay
and
blacky
the
crow
and
redwing
called
all
sorts
of
insulting
things
to
him
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
them
once
redwing
darted
down
and
pecked
him
sharply
but
blacksnake
seemed
quite
helpless
what
the
matter
with
him
asked
johnny
chuck
in
a
whisper
nothing
wait
and
you
see
sammy
jay
and
redwing
better
watch
out
or
they
be
sorry
replied
peter
rabbit
just
then
blacksnake
wedged
his
head
in
under
the
old
log
and
began
to
push
and
wriggle
harder
than
ever
then
johnny
chuck
gasped
blacksnake
was
crawling
out
of
his
clothes
yes
sir
his
old
suit
was
coming
off
wrong
side
out
just
like
a
glove
and
underneath
he
wore
a
splendid
new
suit
of
shiny
black
it
time
for
us
to
be
moving
whispered
peter
rabbit
after
blacksnake
has
changed
his
clothes
he
is
pretty
short
tempered
just
hear
him
hiss
at
redwing
and
sammy
jay
they
tiptoed
out
of
the
alder
thicket
and
started
back
for
the
old
house
on
the
hill
peter
rabbit
suddenly
giggled
out
loud
said
peter
rabbit
we
come
back
and
get
blacksnake
old
suit
and
have
some
fun
with
danny
meadow
mouse
the
next
morning
danny
meadow
mouse
sat
on
his
doorstep
nodding
he
was
dreaming
that
his
tail
was
long
like
the
tails
of
all
his
cousins
one
of
old
mother
west
wind
merry
little
breezes
stole
up
and
whispered
in
his
ear
danny
meadow
mouse
was
awake
wide
awake
in
an
instant
so
peter
rabbit
is
going
to
play
a
joke
on
me
and
scare
me
into
fits
said
danny
meadow
mouse
yes
said
the
merry
little
breeze
for
i
overheard
him
telling
johnny
chuck
all
about
it
danny
meadow
mouse
began
to
laugh
softly
to
himself
will
you
do
something
for
me
he
asked
the
merry
little
breeze
sure
replied
the
merry
little
breeze
then
go
find
cresty
the
and
tell
him
that
i
want
to
see
him
said
danny
meadow
mouse
the
merry
little
breeze
hurried
away
and
pretty
soon
back
he
came
with
cresty
the
now
all
this
time
peter
rabbit
had
been
very
busy
planning
his
joke
on
danny
meadow
mouse
he
and
johnny
chuck
had
gone
down
to
the
alder
thicket
where
they
had
seen
blacksnake
change
his
clothes
and
they
had
found
his
old
suit
just
as
he
had
left
it
we
take
this
up
and
stretch
it
out
behind
a
big
tussock
of
grass
near
the
home
of
danny
meadow
mouse
chuckled
peter
rabbit
then
invite
danny
meadow
mouse
to
take
a
walk
and
when
we
come
by
the
tussock
of
grass
he
will
think
he
sees
blacksnake
himself
all
ready
to
swallow
him
then
we
see
some
fun
so
they
carried
blacksnake
old
suit
of
clothes
and
hid
it
behind
the
big
tussock
of
grass
and
arranged
it
to
look
as
much
like
blacksnake
as
they
could
then
johnny
chuck
went
back
to
the
old
house
on
the
hill
to
watch
the
fun
while
peter
rabbit
went
to
call
on
danny
meadow
mouse
good
morning
peter
rabbit
said
danny
meadow
mouse
politely
good
morning
danny
meadow
mouse
replied
peter
rabbit
do
you
want
to
take
a
walk
with
me
this
fine
morning
i
be
delighted
to
go
said
danny
meadow
mouse
reaching
for
his
hat
so
they
started
out
to
walk
and
presently
they
came
to
the
big
tussock
of
grass
peter
rabbit
stopped
excuse
me
while
i
tie
up
my
shoe
you
go
ahead
and
i
join
you
in
a
minute
said
peter
rabbit
so
danny
meadow
mouse
went
ahead
as
soon
as
his
back
was
turned
peter
rabbit
clapped
both
hands
over
his
mouth
to
keep
from
laughing
for
you
see
he
expected
to
see
danny
meadow
mouse
come
flying
back
in
great
fright
the
minute
he
turned
the
big
tussock
and
saw
blacksnake
old
suit
peter
rabbit
waited
and
waited
but
no
danny
meadow
mouse
what
did
it
mean
peter
stopped
laughing
and
peeped
around
the
big
tussock
there
sat
danny
meadow
mouse
with
both
hands
clapped
over
his
mouth
and
laughing
till
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
and
blacksnake
old
suit
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
he
laughs
best
who
laughs
last
said
danny
meadow
mouse
to
himself
late
that
afternoon
as
he
sat
on
his
doorstep
and
chuckled
softly
when
he
had
first
heard
from
a
merry
little
breeze
that
peter
rabbit
and
johnny
chuck
were
planning
to
play
a
joke
on
him
and
scare
him
into
fits
with
a
suit
of
blacksnake
old
clothes
he
had
tried
very
hard
to
think
of
some
way
to
turn
the
joke
on
the
jokers
then
he
had
remembered
cresty
the
and
had
sent
for
him
now
cresty
the
is
a
handsome
fellow
in
fact
he
is
quite
the
gentleman
and
does
not
look
at
all
like
one
who
would
be
at
all
interested
in
any
one
old
clothes
but
he
is
he
is
never
satisfied
until
he
has
lined
the
hollow
in
the
old
which
is
his
home
with
the
old
clothes
of
snake
so
when
danny
meadow
mouse
sent
for
him
and
whispered
in
his
ear
cresty
the
smiled
broadly
and
winked
knowingly
i
certainly
will
be
there
danny
meadow
mouse
i
certainly
will
be
there
said
he
and
he
was
there
he
had
hidden
in
a
tree
close
by
the
big
tussock
of
grass
behind
which
peter
rabbit
had
planned
to
place
blacksnake
old
suit
so
as
to
scare
danny
meadow
mouse
his
eyes
had
sparkled
when
he
saw
what
a
fine
big
suit
it
was
my
but
this
will
save
me
a
lot
of
trouble
said
he
to
himself
it
the
finest
old
suit
i
ever
seen
the
minute
peter
rabbit
and
johnny
chuck
had
turned
their
backs
down
dropped
cresty
the
picked
up
blacksnake
old
suit
and
taking
it
with
him
once
more
hid
in
the
tree
presently
back
came
peter
rabbit
with
danny
meadow
mouse
you
know
what
had
happened
then
cresty
the
had
nearly
dropped
his
prize
it
tickled
him
so
to
see
peter
rabbit
on
one
side
of
the
big
tussock
laughing
fit
to
kill
himself
at
the
scare
he
thought
danny
meadow
mouse
would
get
when
he
first
saw
blacksnake
old
suit
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
big
tussock
danny
meadow
mouse
laughing
fit
to
kill
himself
over
the
surprise
peter
rabbit
would
get
when
he
found
that
blacksnake
old
clothes
had
disappeared
pretty
soon
peter
rabbit
had
stopped
laughing
and
peeped
around
the
big
tussock
there
sat
danny
meadow
mouse
laughing
fit
to
kill
himself
but
not
a
trace
of
the
old
suit
which
was
to
have
given
him
such
a
scare
peter
could
believe
his
own
eyes
for
he
had
left
it
there
not
three
minutes
before
of
course
it
would
do
to
say
anything
about
it
so
he
had
hurried
around
the
big
tussock
as
if
he
was
merely
trying
to
catch
up
what
are
you
laughing
at
danny
meadow
mouse
asked
peter
rabbit
i
was
thinking
what
a
joke
it
would
be
if
we
could
only
find
an
old
suit
of
blacksnake
and
fool
old
toad
into
thinking
that
it
was
blacksnake
himself
replied
danny
meadow
mouse
what
are
you
looking
for
peter
rabbit
have
you
lost
something
no
said
peter
rabbit
i
thought
i
heard
footsteps
and
i
was
looking
to
see
if
it
could
be
reddy
fox
creeping
through
the
grass
danny
meadow
mouse
had
stopped
laughing
excuse
me
peter
rabbit
said
he
hurriedly
i
just
remembered
an
important
engagement
and
off
he
started
for
home
as
fast
as
he
could
go
and
to
this
day
peter
rabbit
does
know
what
became
of
blacksnake
old
clothes
viii
the
fuss
in
the
big
pine
peter
rabbit
hopped
down
the
crooked
little
path
to
the
lone
little
path
and
down
the
lone
little
path
to
the
home
of
johnny
chuck
johnny
chuck
sat
on
his
doorstep
dreaming
they
were
very
pleasant
dreams
very
pleasant
dreams
indeed
they
were
such
pleasant
dreams
that
for
once
johnny
chuck
forgot
to
put
his
funny
little
ears
on
guard
so
johnny
chuck
sat
on
his
doorstep
dreaming
and
heard
nothing
down
the
lone
little
path
came
peter
rabbit
he
saw
johnny
chuck
and
he
stopped
long
enough
to
pluck
a
long
stem
of
grass
then
very
very
softly
he
stole
up
behind
johnny
chuck
reaching
out
with
the
long
stem
of
grass
he
tickled
one
of
johnny
chuck
ears
johnny
chuck
slapped
at
his
ear
with
a
little
black
hand
for
he
thought
a
fly
was
bothering
him
just
as
peter
rabbit
meant
that
he
should
peter
tickled
the
other
ear
johnny
chuck
shook
his
head
and
slapped
at
this
with
the
other
little
black
hand
peter
almost
giggled
he
sat
still
a
few
minutes
then
tickled
johnny
chuck
again
johnny
slapped
three
or
four
times
at
the
imaginary
fly
this
time
peter
clapped
both
hands
over
his
mouth
to
keep
from
laughing
once
more
he
tickled
johnny
chuck
this
time
johnny
jumped
clear
off
his
doorstep
peter
laughed
before
he
could
clap
his
hands
over
his
mouth
of
course
johnny
chuck
heard
him
and
whirled
about
when
he
saw
peter
rabbit
and
the
long
stem
of
grass
he
laughed
too
hello
peter
rabbit
you
fooled
me
that
time
where
you
come
from
asked
johnny
chuck
down
the
lone
little
path
from
the
crooked
little
path
and
down
the
crooked
little
path
from
the
top
of
the
hill
replied
peter
rabbit
then
they
sat
down
side
by
side
on
johnny
chuck
doorstep
to
watch
reddy
fox
hunting
for
his
dinner
on
the
green
meadows
pretty
soon
they
heard
blacky
the
crow
cawing
very
loudly
they
could
see
him
on
the
of
a
big
pine
in
the
green
forest
on
the
edge
of
the
green
meadows
caw
caw
caw
shouted
blacky
the
crow
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
in
a
few
minutes
they
saw
all
of
blacky
aunts
and
uncles
and
cousins
flying
over
to
join
blacky
at
the
big
pine
in
the
midst
of
the
green
forest
soon
there
was
a
big
crowd
of
crows
around
the
big
pine
all
talking
at
once
such
a
racket
such
a
dreadful
racket
every
few
minutes
one
of
them
would
fly
into
the
big
pine
and
yell
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
then
all
would
caw
together
another
would
fly
into
the
big
pine
and
they
would
do
it
all
over
again
peter
rabbit
began
to
get
interested
for
you
know
peter
has
a
very
great
deal
of
curiosity
now
i
wonder
what
blacky
the
crow
and
his
aunts
and
his
uncles
and
his
cousins
are
making
such
a
fuss
about
said
peter
rabbit
i
sure
i
do
know
replied
johnny
chuck
they
seem
to
be
having
a
good
time
anyway
my
gracious
how
noisy
they
are
just
then
along
came
sammy
jay
who
is
as
you
know
first
cousin
to
blacky
the
crow
he
was
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
big
pine
sammy
oh
sammy
jay
what
is
all
that
fuss
about
over
in
the
big
pine
shouted
peter
rabbit
sammy
jay
stopped
and
carefully
brushed
his
handsome
blue
coat
for
sammy
jay
is
something
of
a
dandy
he
appeared
not
to
have
heard
peter
rabbit
sammy
jay
are
you
deaf
inquired
peter
rabbit
now
of
course
sammy
jay
had
seen
peter
rabbit
and
johnny
chuck
all
the
time
but
he
looked
up
as
if
very
much
surprised
to
find
them
there
oh
hello
peter
rabbit
said
sammy
jay
did
you
speak
to
me
no
oh
no
replied
peter
rabbit
in
disgust
i
was
talking
to
myself
just
thinking
out
loud
i
was
wondering
how
many
nuts
a
jay
could
steal
if
he
had
the
chance
johnny
chuck
chuckled
and
sammy
jay
looked
foolish
he
could
find
a
word
to
say
for
he
knew
that
all
the
little
meadow
people
knew
how
he
once
was
caught
stealing
happy
jack
store
of
nuts
i
asked
what
all
that
fuss
over
in
the
big
pine
is
about
continued
peter
rabbit
oh
said
sammy
jay
my
cousin
blacky
the
crow
found
hooty
the
owl
asleep
over
there
and
now
he
and
his
aunts
and
his
uncles
and
his
cousins
are
having
no
end
of
fun
with
him
you
know
hooty
the
owl
can
not
see
in
the
daytime
very
well
and
they
can
do
almost
anything
to
him
that
they
want
to
it
great
sport
i
do
see
any
sport
in
making
other
people
uncomfortable
said
johnny
chuck
nor
i
said
peter
rabbit
i
be
ashamed
to
own
a
cousin
like
blacky
the
crow
i
like
people
who
mind
their
own
affairs
and
leave
other
people
alone
sammy
jay
ran
out
his
tongue
at
peter
rabbit
you
are
a
nice
one
to
talk
about
minding
other
folk
affairs
jeered
sammy
jay
peter
rabbit
ears
are
long
i
wonder
why
i
wonder
why
because
to
hear
what
others
say
he
bound
to
try
he
bound
to
try
it
was
peter
rabbit
turn
to
look
discomfited
anyway
i
do
try
to
bully
and
torment
others
and
i
do
steal
he
retorted
sammy
jay
a
handsome
chap
and
wears
a
coat
of
blue
i
wonder
if
it
really
his
or
if
he
stole
too
just
then
johnny
chuck
sharp
eyes
caught
sight
of
something
stealing
along
the
edge
of
the
green
meadows
toward
the
green
forest
and
the
big
pine
there
farmer
brown
boy
with
a
gun
cried
johnny
chuck
going
to
be
trouble
at
the
big
pine
if
blacky
the
crow
does
watch
out
that
what
comes
of
being
so
noisy
peter
rabbit
and
sammy
jay
stopped
quarreling
to
look
sure
enough
there
was
farmer
brown
boy
with
his
gun
he
had
heard
blacky
the
crow
and
his
aunts
and
his
uncles
and
his
cousins
and
he
had
hurried
to
get
his
gun
hoping
to
take
them
by
surprise
but
blacky
the
crow
has
sharp
eyes
too
indeed
there
are
none
sharper
then
too
he
is
a
are
always
on
the
watch
lest
they
get
caught
in
their
mischief
so
blacky
the
crow
sitting
on
the
of
the
big
pine
kept
one
eye
out
for
trouble
while
he
enjoyed
the
tormenting
of
hooty
the
owl
by
his
aunts
and
his
uncles
and
his
cousins
he
had
seen
farmer
brown
boy
even
before
johnny
chuck
had
but
he
could
bear
to
spoil
the
fun
of
tormenting
hooty
the
owl
so
he
waited
just
as
long
as
he
dared
then
he
gave
the
signal
caw
caw
caw
caw
shouted
blacky
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
caw
caw
caw
caw
replied
all
his
aunts
and
uncles
and
cousins
rising
into
the
air
in
a
black
cloud
then
with
blacky
in
the
lead
they
flew
over
on
to
the
green
meadows
laughing
and
talking
noisily
as
they
went
farmer
brown
boy
did
not
try
to
follow
them
for
he
knew
that
it
was
of
not
the
least
bit
of
use
but
he
was
curious
to
learn
what
the
crows
had
been
making
such
a
fuss
about
so
he
kept
on
towards
the
big
pine
johnny
chuck
watched
him
go
suddenly
he
remembered
hooty
the
owl
and
that
hooty
can
not
see
well
in
the
daytime
very
likely
hooty
would
think
that
the
crows
had
become
tired
of
tormenting
him
and
had
gone
off
of
their
own
accord
farmer
brown
boy
would
find
him
there
and
then
johnny
chuck
shuddered
as
he
thought
of
what
might
happen
to
hooty
the
owl
run
peter
rabbit
run
as
fast
as
you
can
down
on
the
green
meadows
where
the
merry
little
breezes
are
at
play
and
send
one
of
them
to
tell
hooty
the
owl
that
farmer
brown
boy
is
coming
with
a
gun
to
the
big
pine
hurry
peter
hurry
cried
johnny
chuck
peter
did
not
need
to
be
told
twice
he
saw
the
danger
of
hooty
the
owl
and
he
started
down
the
lone
little
path
on
to
the
green
meadows
so
fast
that
in
a
few
minutes
all
johnny
chuck
and
sammy
jay
could
see
of
him
was
a
little
spot
of
white
which
was
the
patch
on
the
seat
of
pants
bobbing
through
the
grass
on
the
green
meadows
johnny
chuck
would
have
gone
himself
but
he
is
round
and
fat
and
and
can
not
run
fast
while
peter
rabbit
legs
are
long
and
meant
for
running
in
a
few
minutes
johnny
chuck
saw
one
of
the
merry
little
breezes
start
for
the
big
pine
as
fast
as
he
could
go
johnny
gave
a
great
sigh
of
relief
farmer
brown
boy
kept
on
to
the
big
pine
when
he
got
there
he
found
no
one
there
for
hooty
the
owl
had
heeded
the
warning
of
the
merry
little
breeze
and
had
flown
into
the
deepest
darkest
part
of
the
green
forest
where
not
even
the
sharp
eyes
of
blacky
the
crow
were
likely
to
find
him
and
back
on
his
doorstep
johnny
chuck
chuckled
to
himself
for
he
was
happy
was
johnny
chuck
happy
because
he
possessed
the
best
thing
in
the
world
which
is
contentment
and
this
is
all
i
am
going
to
tell
you
about
the
fuss
in
the
big
pine
ix
johnny
chuck
finds
a
use
for
his
back
door
johnny
chuck
sat
in
his
doorway
looking
over
the
green
meadows
he
felt
very
fine
he
had
had
a
good
breakfast
in
the
patch
he
had
had
a
good
nap
on
his
own
doorstep
by
and
by
he
saw
the
merry
little
breezes
of
old
mother
west
wind
hurrying
in
his
direction
they
seemed
in
a
very
great
hurry
they
did
stop
to
kiss
the
buttercups
or
tease
the
daisies
johnny
pricked
up
his
small
ears
and
watched
them
hurry
up
the
hill
good
morning
johnny
chuck
panted
the
first
merry
little
breeze
to
reach
him
have
you
heard
the
news
what
news
asked
johnny
chuck
the
news
about
old
mother
chuck
replied
the
merry
little
breezes
johnny
shook
his
head
no
said
he
what
is
it
the
merry
little
breezes
grew
very
very
sober
it
is
bad
news
they
replied
what
is
it
tell
me
quick
begged
johnny
just
then
reddy
fox
came
hopping
and
skipping
down
the
lone
little
path
hi
johnny
chuck
have
you
heard
the
news
no
said
johnny
chuck
do
tell
me
quick
reddy
fox
grinned
maliciously
for
reddy
likes
to
torment
others
about
old
chuck
said
reddy
i
know
that
already
replied
johnny
but
please
what
is
it
farmer
brown
boy
has
caught
old
chuck
and
now
i
would
wonder
but
what
he
will
come
up
here
and
catch
you
replied
reddy
turning
a
somersault
johnny
chuck
grew
pale
he
had
not
seen
mother
chuck
to
speak
to
since
he
ran
away
from
home
now
he
was
glad
that
he
had
run
away
and
yet
sorry
oh
so
sorry
that
anything
had
happened
to
chuck
two
big
tears
came
into
his
eyes
and
ran
down
his
funny
little
black
nose
the
merry
little
breezes
saw
this
and
one
of
them
hurried
over
and
whispered
in
johnny
chuck
ear
do
cry
johnny
chuck
whispered
the
merry
little
breeze
old
mother
chuck
got
away
and
farmer
brown
boy
is
still
wondering
how
she
did
it
johnny
heart
gave
a
great
throb
of
relief
i
do
believe
that
farmer
brown
boy
will
catch
me
said
johnny
chuck
for
my
house
has
two
back
doors
johnny
chuck
awoke
very
early
the
next
morning
he
stretched
and
yawned
and
then
just
lay
quietly
enjoying
himself
for
a
few
minutes
his
bedchamber
way
down
underground
was
snug
and
warm
and
very
very
comfortable
by
and
by
johnny
chuck
heard
a
noise
up
by
his
front
door
i
wonder
what
is
going
on
out
there
said
johnny
chuck
to
himself
and
jumping
up
he
tiptoed
softly
up
the
long
hall
until
he
had
almost
reached
his
doorway
then
he
heard
a
voice
which
he
had
heard
before
and
it
made
little
shivers
run
all
over
him
it
was
the
voice
of
granny
fox
so
this
is
where
that
fat
little
chuck
has
made
his
home
said
granny
fox
yes
replied
another
voice
this
is
where
johnny
chuck
lives
for
i
saw
him
here
yesterday
johnny
pricked
up
his
ears
for
that
was
the
voice
of
reddy
fox
do
you
think
he
is
in
here
now
inquired
granny
fox
i
am
sure
of
it
replied
reddy
for
i
have
been
watching
ever
since
jolly
round
red
sun
threw
his
nightcap
off
this
morning
and
johnny
chuck
has
not
put
his
nose
out
yet
good
said
granny
fox
i
think
fat
chuck
will
taste
good
for
breakfast
johnny
felt
the
cold
shivers
run
over
him
again
as
he
heard
granny
fox
and
reddy
fox
smack
their
lips
then
granny
fox
spoke
again
you
lie
down
behind
that
bunch
of
grass
over
there
reddy
and
i
will
lie
down
behind
the
old
when
he
comes
out
you
just
jump
into
his
doorway
and
i
will
catch
him
before
he
can
say
jack
robinson
johnny
waited
and
listened
and
listened
but
all
was
as
still
as
still
could
be
then
johnny
chuck
tiptoed
back
along
the
hall
to
his
bedroom
and
sat
down
to
think
he
felt
sure
that
granny
fox
and
reddy
were
waiting
for
him
just
as
he
had
heard
them
plan
however
am
i
going
to
know
when
they
leave
said
johnny
chuck
to
himself
then
he
remembered
the
back
doors
which
he
had
taken
such
care
to
make
and
which
peter
rabbit
had
laughed
at
him
for
taking
the
trouble
to
make
he
had
hidden
one
so
cunningly
in
the
long
grass
and
had
so
carefully
removed
all
sand
from
around
it
that
he
felt
quite
sure
that
no
one
had
found
it
very
softly
johnny
chuck
crept
along
the
back
passageway
very
very
cautiously
he
stuck
his
little
black
nose
out
the
doorway
and
sniffed
yes
he
could
smell
foxes
but
he
knew
that
they
were
not
at
his
back
door
little
by
little
he
crept
out
until
he
could
peep
through
the
grass
there
lay
reddy
fox
behind
a
big
clump
of
grass
his
eyes
fixed
on
johnny
chuck
front
door
and
there
behind
the
lay
granny
fox
taking
her
ease
but
all
ready
to
jump
when
reddy
should
give
the
word
johnny
chuck
almost
giggled
out
loud
as
he
saw
how
eagerly
reddy
fox
was
watching
for
him
then
johnny
chuck
had
an
idea
that
made
him
giggle
harder
his
black
eyes
snapped
and
he
chuckled
to
himself
pretty
soon
along
came
bumble
the
bee
looking
for
honey
he
came
bustling
and
humming
through
the
tall
grass
and
settled
on
a
dandelion
right
on
the
doorstep
of
johnny
chuck
back
door
good
morning
grumbled
bumble
the
bee
johnny
put
a
hand
on
his
lips
and
beckoned
bumble
to
come
inside
now
bumble
the
bee
is
a
gruff
and
rough
fellow
but
he
is
a
good
fellow
too
when
you
know
him
johnny
chuck
had
many
times
told
him
of
places
where
the
flowers
grew
thick
and
sweet
so
when
johnny
beckoned
to
him
bumble
came
at
once
will
you
do
something
for
me
bumble
whispered
johnny
chuck
of
course
i
will
replied
bumble
in
his
gruff
voice
what
is
it
then
johnny
chuck
told
bumble
the
bee
how
granny
and
reddy
fox
were
waiting
for
him
to
come
out
for
his
breakfast
and
how
they
had
planned
to
gobble
him
up
for
their
own
breakfast
bumble
the
bee
grew
very
indignant
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
johnny
chuck
he
asked
if
i
can
help
you
just
tell
me
how
johnny
whispered
something
to
bumble
the
bee
and
bumble
laughed
right
out
loud
then
he
buzzed
up
out
of
the
doorway
and
johnny
crept
up
to
watch
straight
over
to
where
reddy
fox
was
squatting
behind
the
clump
of
grass
flew
bumble
the
bee
so
swiftly
that
johnny
could
hardly
see
him
suddenly
reddy
gave
a
yelp
and
sprang
into
the
air
johnny
chuck
clapped
both
hands
over
his
mouth
to
keep
from
laughing
out
loud
for
you
see
bumble
the
bee
had
stuck
his
sharp
little
lance
into
one
of
the
ears
of
reddy
fox
granny
fox
looked
up
and
scowled
keep
still
she
whispered
just
then
reddy
yelped
louder
than
before
for
bumble
had
stung
him
in
the
other
ear
what
the
matter
snapped
granny
fox
i
do
know
cried
reddy
fox
hanging
on
to
both
ears
you
are
began
granny
fox
but
johnny
chuck
never
knew
what
she
was
going
to
say
reddy
fox
was
for
you
see
just
then
bumble
the
bee
thrust
his
sharp
little
lance
into
one
of
her
ears
and
before
she
could
turn
around
he
had
done
the
same
thing
to
the
other
ear
granny
fox
did
wait
for
any
more
she
started
off
as
fast
as
she
could
go
with
reddy
fox
after
her
and
every
few
steps
they
rubbed
their
ears
and
shook
their
heads
as
if
they
thought
they
could
shake
out
the
pain
x
billy
mink
goes
dinnerless
down
the
laughing
brook
came
billy
mink
he
was
feeling
very
good
that
morning
was
billy
mink
pleased
with
the
world
in
general
and
with
himself
in
particular
when
he
reached
the
smiling
pool
he
swam
out
to
the
big
rock
little
joe
otter
was
already
there
and
not
far
away
lazily
floating
with
his
head
and
back
out
of
water
was
jerry
muskrat
hello
billy
mink
cried
little
joe
otter
hello
yourself
replied
billy
mink
with
a
grin
where
are
you
going
asked
little
joe
otter
nowhere
in
particular
replied
billy
mink
let
go
fishing
down
to
the
big
river
said
little
joe
otter
let
cried
billy
diving
from
the
highest
point
on
the
big
rock
so
off
they
started
across
the
green
meadows
towards
the
big
river
half
way
there
they
met
reddy
fox
hello
reddy
come
on
with
us
to
the
big
river
fishing
called
billy
mink
illustration
come
on
with
us
to
the
big
river
fishing
called
billy
mink
now
reddy
fox
is
no
fisherman
though
he
likes
fish
to
eat
well
enough
he
remembered
the
last
time
he
went
fishing
and
how
billy
mink
had
laughed
at
him
when
he
fell
into
the
smiling
pool
he
was
just
about
to
say
no
when
he
changed
his
mind
all
right
i
go
said
reddy
fox
so
the
three
of
them
raced
merrily
across
the
green
meadows
until
they
came
to
the
big
river
now
billy
mink
and
little
joe
otter
are
famous
fishermen
and
can
swim
even
faster
than
the
fish
themselves
but
reddy
fox
is
a
poor
swimmer
and
must
depend
upon
his
wits
when
they
reached
the
bank
of
the
big
river
they
very
carefully
crawled
down
to
a
sandy
beach
there
just
a
little
way
out
from
shore
a
school
of
little
striped
perch
were
at
play
billy
mink
and
little
joe
otter
prepared
to
dive
in
and
each
grab
a
fish
but
reddy
fox
knew
that
he
could
not
swim
well
enough
for
that
wait
a
minute
whispered
reddy
billy
mink
you
go
up
the
river
a
little
way
and
swim
out
beyond
where
the
fish
are
at
play
little
joe
otter
you
go
down
the
river
a
little
way
and
swim
out
to
join
billy
mink
then
both
together
rush
in
as
fast
as
you
can
swim
the
fish
will
be
so
frightened
they
will
rush
in
where
the
water
is
shallow
of
course
you
will
each
catch
one
anyway
and
perhaps
i
may
be
so
lucky
as
to
catch
one
in
the
shallow
water
billy
mink
and
little
joe
otter
agreed
and
did
just
as
reddy
fox
had
told
them
to
when
they
were
between
the
playing
fish
and
deep
water
they
started
in
with
a
rush
the
little
striped
perch
were
young
and
foolish
when
they
saw
billy
mink
and
little
joe
otter
they
rushed
madly
away
from
them
without
looking
to
see
where
they
were
going
to
as
reddy
fox
had
foreseen
would
be
the
case
a
lot
of
them
became
stranded
where
the
water
was
too
shallow
for
swimming
and
there
they
jumped
and
flapped
helplessly
reddy
was
waiting
for
them
and
in
a
twinkling
his
little
black
paw
had
scooped
half
a
dozen
fish
high
and
dry
on
the
beach
billy
mink
and
little
joe
otter
were
too
busy
watching
the
fish
to
see
what
reddy
was
doing
he
had
caught
six
fish
and
these
he
hid
under
a
log
when
billy
mink
and
little
joe
otter
swam
ashore
reddy
was
the
picture
of
disappointment
for
he
had
nothing
to
show
while
the
others
each
had
a
plump
little
fish
never
mind
said
little
joe
otter
i
give
you
the
next
one
i
catch
but
billy
mink
jeered
at
reddy
fox
pooh
you
no
fisherman
reddy
fox
if
i
could
catch
fish
when
they
are
chased
right
into
my
hands
i
never
go
fishing
reddy
fox
pretended
to
be
indignant
i
tell
you
what
billy
mink
said
he
if
i
do
catch
more
fish
than
you
do
i
bring
you
the
plumpest
chicken
in
farmer
brown
dooryard
but
if
i
do
catch
more
fish
than
you
do
you
will
give
me
the
biggest
one
you
catch
do
you
agree
now
billy
mink
is
very
fond
of
plump
chicken
and
here
was
a
chance
to
get
one
without
danger
of
meeting
bowser
the
hound
who
guards
farmer
brown
chickens
so
billy
mink
agreed
to
give
reddy
fox
the
biggest
fish
he
caught
that
day
if
reddy
could
show
more
fish
than
he
could
at
the
end
of
the
day
all
the
time
he
chuckled
to
himself
for
you
know
billy
mink
is
a
famous
fisherman
and
he
knew
that
reddy
fox
is
a
poor
swimmer
and
does
not
like
the
water
by
and
by
they
came
to
another
sandy
beach
like
the
first
one
they
could
see
another
school
of
foolish
young
fish
at
play
as
before
reddy
fox
remained
on
shore
while
the
others
swam
out
and
drove
the
fish
in
as
before
reddy
caught
half
a
dozen
while
billy
mink
and
little
joe
otter
each
caught
one
this
time
reddy
hid
five
and
then
pretended
to
be
so
tickled
over
catching
one
the
smallest
of
the
lot
that
billy
mink
did
once
suspect
a
trick
two
or
three
times
more
reddy
fox
repeated
this
then
he
discovered
a
big
pickerel
sunning
himself
beside
an
old
log
floating
in
deep
water
reddy
could
catch
pickerel
for
the
water
was
deep
what
should
he
do
reddy
sat
down
to
think
finally
he
thought
of
a
plan
very
cautiously
he
backed
away
so
as
not
to
scare
the
big
fish
then
he
called
billy
mink
when
billy
saw
the
big
pickerel
his
mouth
watered
too
and
his
little
black
eyes
sparkled
very
quietly
billy
slipped
into
the
water
back
of
the
old
log
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
ripple
to
warn
the
big
pickerel
drawing
a
long
breath
billy
dived
under
the
log
and
coming
up
under
the
big
pickerel
seized
it
by
the
middle
there
was
a
tremendous
thrashing
and
splashing
and
then
billy
mink
swam
ashore
and
proudly
laid
the
big
fish
on
the
bank
do
you
wish
it
was
yours
asked
billy
mink
it
ought
to
be
mine
for
i
saw
it
first
said
reddy
fox
but
you
did
catch
it
and
i
did
retorted
billy
mink
i
going
to
have
it
for
my
dinner
my
but
i
do
like
fat
pickerel
billy
smacked
his
lips
reddy
fox
said
nothing
but
tried
his
best
to
look
disappointed
and
dejected
all
the
time
he
was
chuckling
inwardly
for
the
rest
of
the
day
the
fishing
was
poor
just
as
old
mother
west
wind
started
for
the
green
meadows
to
take
her
children
the
merry
little
breezes
to
their
home
behind
the
purple
hills
the
three
little
fishermen
started
to
count
up
their
catch
then
reddy
brought
out
all
the
fish
that
he
had
hidden
when
they
saw
the
pile
of
fish
reddy
fox
had
billy
mink
and
little
joe
otter
were
so
surprised
that
their
eyes
popped
out
and
their
jaws
dropped
very
foolish
they
looked
very
foolish
indeed
for
reddy
had
four
times
as
many
as
either
of
them
reddy
walked
over
to
the
big
pickerel
and
picking
it
up
carried
it
over
to
his
pile
what
are
you
doing
with
my
fish
shouted
billy
mink
angrily
it
is
yours
it
mine
retorted
reddy
fox
billy
mink
fairly
danced
up
and
down
he
was
so
angry
it
not
yours
he
shrieked
it
mine
for
i
caught
it
and
you
agreed
that
your
biggest
fish
should
be
mine
if
i
caught
more
fish
than
you
did
i
caught
four
times
as
many
so
the
pickerel
is
mine
retorted
reddy
winking
at
little
joe
otter
then
billy
mink
did
a
very
foolish
thing
he
lost
his
temper
completely
he
called
reddy
fox
bad
names
but
he
did
not
dare
try
to
take
the
big
pickerel
away
from
reddy
for
reddy
is
much
bigger
than
he
finally
he
worked
himself
into
such
a
rage
that
he
ran
off
home
leaving
his
pile
of
fish
behind
reddy
fox
and
little
joe
otter
took
care
not
to
touch
billy
mink
fish
but
reddy
divided
his
big
pile
with
little
joe
otter
then
they
too
started
for
home
reddy
carrying
the
big
pickerel
late
that
night
when
he
had
recovered
his
temper
billy
mink
began
to
grow
hungry
the
more
he
thought
of
his
fish
the
hungrier
he
grew
finally
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
started
for
the
big
river
to
see
what
had
become
of
his
fish
he
reached
the
strip
of
beach
where
he
had
so
foolishly
left
them
just
in
time
to
see
the
last
striped
perch
disappear
down
the
long
throat
of
night
heron
and
this
is
how
it
happened
that
billy
mink
went
dinnerless
to
bed
but
he
had
learned
three
things
had
billy
and
he
never
forgot
them
that
wit
is
often
better
than
skill
that
it
is
not
only
mean
but
is
very
foolish
to
sneer
at
another
and
that
to
lose
one
temper
is
the
most
foolish
thing
in
the
world
xi
grandfather
frog
journey
grandfather
frog
sat
on
his
big
green
in
the
smiling
pool
and
grandfather
frog
was
asleep
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
grandfather
frog
was
really
and
truly
asleep
his
hands
were
folded
across
his
white
and
yellow
waistcoat
and
his
eyes
were
closed
three
times
the
merry
little
breezes
blew
a
foolish
green
fly
right
past
his
nose
grandfather
frog
did
so
much
as
blink
presently
billy
mink
discovered
that
grandfather
frog
was
asleep
billy
little
black
eyes
twinkled
with
mischief
as
he
hurried
over
to
the
slippery
slide
in
search
of
little
joe
otter
then
the
two
scamps
hunted
up
jerry
muskrat
they
found
him
very
busy
storing
away
a
supply
of
food
in
his
new
house
at
first
jerry
refused
to
listen
to
what
they
had
to
say
but
the
more
they
talked
the
more
jerry
became
interested
we
wo
hurt
grandfather
frog
not
the
least
little
bit
protested
billy
mink
it
will
be
just
the
best
joke
and
the
greatest
fun
ever
and
no
harm
done
the
more
jerry
thought
over
billy
mink
plan
the
funnier
the
joke
seemed
finally
jerry
agreed
to
join
billy
mink
and
little
joe
otter
then
the
three
put
their
heads
together
and
with
a
lot
of
giggling
and
chuckling
they
planned
their
joke
on
grandfather
frog
now
jerry
muskrat
can
stay
a
very
long
time
under
water
and
his
teeth
are
long
and
sharp
in
order
to
cut
the
roots
on
which
he
depends
for
much
of
his
food
so
jerry
swam
out
to
the
big
green
on
which
sat
grandfather
frog
fast
asleep
diving
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
smiling
pool
jerry
cut
off
the
stem
of
the
big
green
close
to
its
root
way
down
in
the
mud
while
jerry
was
at
work
doing
this
billy
mink
sent
the
merry
little
breezes
hurrying
over
the
green
meadows
to
call
all
the
little
meadow
people
to
the
smiling
pool
then
when
jerry
muskrat
came
up
for
a
breath
of
air
billy
mink
dived
down
and
getting
hold
of
the
end
of
the
stem
he
began
to
swim
towing
the
big
green
after
him
very
slowly
and
gently
so
as
not
to
waken
grandfather
frog
when
billy
had
to
come
up
for
air
little
joe
otter
took
his
place
then
jerry
muskrat
took
his
turn
across
the
smiling
pool
past
the
big
rock
they
towed
the
big
green
while
grandfather
frog
slept
peacefully
his
hands
folded
over
his
white
and
yellow
waistcoat
past
the
bulrushes
and
jerry
muskrat
new
house
past
little
joe
otter
slippery
slide
sailed
grandfather
frog
and
still
he
slept
and
dreamed
of
the
days
when
the
world
was
young
out
of
the
smiling
pool
and
into
the
laughing
brook
where
the
brown
water
flows
smoothly
the
three
little
swimmers
towed
the
big
green
it
floated
along
of
itself
now
and
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
steer
it
clear
of
rocks
and
old
logs
once
it
almost
got
away
from
them
on
the
edge
of
a
tiny
waterfall
but
all
three
pulling
together
towed
it
out
of
danger
at
last
in
a
dear
little
pool
with
a
mossy
green
bank
they
anchored
the
big
green
then
billy
mink
hurried
back
to
the
smiling
pool
to
tell
the
little
meadow
people
where
to
find
grandfather
frog
little
joe
otter
climbed
out
on
the
mossy
green
bank
and
jerry
muskrat
joined
him
there
to
rest
and
dry
off
one
by
one
the
little
meadow
people
came
hurrying
up
reddy
fox
was
the
first
then
came
johnny
chuck
and
striped
chipmunk
of
course
peter
rabbit
was
on
hand
you
can
always
count
peter
in
when
there
is
anything
going
on
among
the
little
meadow
people
danny
meadow
mouse
and
happy
jack
squirrel
arrived
quite
out
of
breath
sammy
jay
and
blacky
the
crow
were
not
far
behind
last
of
all
came
jimmy
skunk
who
never
hurries
each
in
turn
peeped
over
the
edge
of
the
mossy
green
bank
to
see
grandfather
frog
still
sleeping
peacefully
on
his
big
green
in
the
dear
little
pool
then
all
hid
where
they
could
see
him
when
he
awoke
but
where
he
could
not
see
them
presently
billy
mink
reached
out
with
a
long
straw
and
tickled
grandfather
frog
on
the
end
of
his
nose
grandfather
frog
opened
his
eyes
and
yawned
sleepily
right
over
his
head
he
saw
jolly
round
red
sun
smiling
down
on
him
just
as
he
last
saw
him
before
falling
asleep
he
yawned
again
and
then
looked
to
see
if
billy
mink
was
sitting
on
the
big
rock
where
was
the
big
rock
grandfather
frog
sat
up
very
suddenly
and
rubbed
his
eyes
there
was
any
big
rock
grandfather
frog
pinched
himself
to
make
sure
that
he
was
awake
then
he
rubbed
his
eyes
again
and
looked
down
at
the
big
green
yes
that
was
his
the
very
same
on
which
he
sat
every
day
grandfather
frog
was
more
perplexed
than
ever
slowly
he
looked
around
where
were
the
slippery
slide
and
jerry
muskrat
new
house
where
were
the
bulrushes
and
where
where
was
the
grandfather
frog
jaw
dropped
as
he
looked
about
him
his
own
big
green
was
the
only
in
sight
had
the
world
turned
while
he
slept
said
grandfather
frog
this
is
very
strange
very
strange
indeed
then
he
turned
around
three
times
and
pinched
himself
again
very
strange
very
strange
indeed
muttered
grandfather
frog
over
and
over
again
he
scratched
his
head
first
with
one
hand
and
then
with
the
other
and
the
more
he
scratched
the
stranger
it
all
seemed
just
then
he
heard
a
giggle
up
on
the
mossy
green
bank
grandfather
frog
whirled
around
he
exclaimed
billy
mink
come
out
from
behind
that
tall
grass
and
tell
me
where
i
am
and
what
this
means
i
might
have
known
that
you
were
at
the
bottom
of
it
then
out
jumped
all
the
little
meadow
people
and
the
merry
little
breezes
to
shout
and
laugh
and
dance
and
roll
over
and
over
on
the
mossy
green
bank
grandfather
frog
looked
at
one
and
then
at
another
and
gradually
he
began
to
smile
pretty
soon
he
was
laughing
as
hard
as
any
of
them
as
billy
mink
told
how
they
had
towed
him
down
to
the
dear
little
pool
and
now
grandfather
frog
we
take
you
home
again
concluded
billy
mink
so
as
before
billy
mink
and
little
joe
otter
and
jerry
muskrat
took
turns
towing
the
big
green
while
in
the
middle
of
it
sat
grandfather
frog
catching
foolish
green
flies
which
the
merry
little
breezes
blew
over
to
him
reddy
fox
johnny
chuck
peter
rabbit
danny
meadow
mouse
striped
chipmunk
happy
jack
squirrel
and
jimmy
skunk
raced
and
capered
along
the
bank
and
shouted
encouragement
to
the
three
little
swimmers
while
flew
sammy
jay
and
blacky
the
crow
and
never
once
losing
his
balance
grandfather
frog
sat
on
the
big
green
enjoying
his
strange
ride
and
smacking
his
lips
over
the
foolish
green
flies
and
so
they
came
once
more
to
the
smiling
pool
past
the
slippery
slide
past
the
bulrushes
and
jerry
muskrat
new
house
and
the
big
rock
until
grandfather
frog
and
his
queer
craft
were
once
more
anchored
safe
and
sound
in
the
old
familiar
place
said
grandfather
frog
i
think
i
like
to
go
again
xii
why
blacky
the
crow
wears
mourning
grandfather
frog
sat
on
his
big
green
in
the
smiling
pool
grandfather
frog
felt
very
good
that
morning
very
good
indeed
because
why
because
his
white
and
yellow
waistcoat
was
full
of
foolish
green
flies
it
is
doubtful
very
very
doubtful
if
grandfather
frog
could
have
swallowed
another
foolish
green
fly
to
save
his
life
so
he
sat
with
his
hands
folded
across
his
white
and
yellow
waistcoat
and
into
his
eyes
his
great
goggly
eyes
there
crept
a
far
far
far
away
look
grandfather
frog
was
dreaming
of
the
days
when
the
world
was
young
and
the
frogs
ruled
the
world
pretty
soon
the
merry
little
breezes
of
old
mother
west
wind
came
over
to
the
smiling
pool
to
rock
redwing
babies
to
sleep
in
their
cradle
in
the
bulrushes
but
when
they
saw
grandfather
frog
they
forgot
all
about
redwing
and
her
babies
good
morning
grandfather
frog
they
shouted
grandfather
frog
awoke
from
his
dream
with
a
funny
little
jump
goodness
how
you
startled
me
said
grandfather
frog
smoothing
down
his
white
and
yellow
waistcoat
the
merry
little
breezes
giggled
we
did
mean
to
truly
we
did
said
the
merriest
one
of
all
we
just
wanted
to
know
how
you
do
this
fine
morning
and
and
said
grandfather
frog
you
want
me
to
tell
you
a
story
the
merry
little
breezes
giggled
again
how
did
you
ever
guess
it
they
cried
it
must
be
because
you
are
so
very
very
wise
will
you
tell
us
a
story
grandfather
frog
will
you
please
grandfather
frog
looked
up
and
winked
one
big
goggly
eye
at
jolly
round
red
sun
who
was
smiling
down
from
the
blue
sky
then
he
sat
still
so
long
that
the
merry
little
breezes
began
to
fear
that
grandfather
frog
was
out
of
sorts
and
that
there
would
be
no
story
that
morning
they
fidgeted
about
among
the
bulrushes
and
danced
back
and
forth
across
the
they
had
even
begun
to
think
again
of
redwing
babies
said
grandfather
frog
suddenly
what
shall
i
tell
you
about
just
then
a
black
shadow
swept
across
the
smiling
pool
caw
caw
caw
caw
shouted
blacky
the
crow
noisily
as
he
flew
over
toward
farmer
brown
cornfield
tell
us
why
blacky
the
crow
always
wears
a
coat
of
black
as
if
he
were
in
mourning
shouted
the
merry
little
breezes
grandfather
frog
watched
blacky
disappear
behind
the
lone
pine
then
when
the
merry
little
breezes
had
settled
down
each
in
the
golden
heart
of
a
white
he
began
once
upon
a
time
when
the
world
was
young
old
crow
the
grandfather
a
thousand
times
removed
of
blacky
whom
you
all
know
lived
in
the
green
forest
on
the
edge
of
the
green
meadows
just
as
blacky
does
now
and
with
him
lived
his
brothers
and
sisters
his
uncles
and
aunts
his
cousins
and
all
his
poor
relations
now
crow
was
very
smart
indeed
he
was
the
smartest
of
all
the
birds
there
was
anything
that
old
crow
could
do
or
know
at
least
he
thought
there
was
all
the
little
meadow
people
and
forest
folks
began
to
think
so
too
and
one
after
another
they
got
in
the
habit
of
coming
to
him
for
advice
until
pretty
soon
they
were
bringing
all
their
affairs
to
crow
for
settlement
now
for
a
while
crow
showed
great
wisdom
and
this
so
pleased
old
mother
nature
that
she
gave
him
a
suit
of
pure
dazzling
white
so
that
all
seeing
him
might
look
up
to
him
as
a
shining
example
of
wisdom
and
virtue
of
course
all
his
brothers
and
sisters
his
uncles
and
aunts
his
cousins
and
all
his
poor
relations
at
once
put
on
white
that
all
might
know
that
they
were
of
crow
family
and
of
course
every
one
showed
them
the
greatest
attention
out
of
respect
to
old
crow
so
that
presently
they
began
to
hold
their
heads
very
high
and
to
think
that
because
they
were
related
to
old
crow
they
were
a
little
better
than
any
of
the
other
little
meadow
people
and
forest
folks
when
they
met
old
rabbit
they
would
pretend
not
to
see
him
because
he
wore
a
white
patch
on
the
seat
of
his
trousers
when
old
woodchuck
said
morning
they
would
pretend
not
to
hear
for
you
know
woodchuck
wore
a
suit
of
dingy
yellow
and
lived
in
a
hole
in
the
ground
old
toad
was
ugly
to
look
upon
besides
he
worked
for
his
living
in
a
garden
so
when
they
happened
to
meet
him
on
the
road
they
always
turned
their
backs
for
a
long
time
old
crow
himself
continued
to
be
a
very
fine
gentleman
and
to
hold
the
respect
of
all
his
neighbors
he
was
polite
to
every
one
and
to
all
who
came
to
him
he
freely
gave
of
his
advice
as
wisely
as
he
knew
how
of
course
it
was
long
before
he
knew
all
about
his
neighbors
and
their
private
affairs
now
it
is
safe
to
know
too
much
about
your
neighbors
and
what
they
are
doing
it
is
dangerous
knowledge
very
dangerous
knowledge
indeed
said
grandfather
frog
solemnly
to
be
sure
it
would
have
been
safe
enough
he
continued
if
crow
had
kept
it
to
himself
but
after
a
while
crow
became
vain
yes
sir
that
is
just
what
happened
to
old
crow
he
became
vain
he
liked
to
feel
that
all
the
little
meadow
people
and
forest
folks
looked
up
to
him
with
respect
and
whenever
he
saw
one
of
them
coming
he
would
brush
his
white
coat
swell
himself
up
and
look
very
important
after
a
while
he
began
to
brag
among
his
relatives
of
how
much
he
knew
about
his
neighbors
of
course
they
were
very
much
interested
very
much
interested
indeed
and
this
flattered
crow
so
that
almost
before
he
knew
it
he
was
telling
some
of
the
private
affairs
which
had
been
brought
to
him
for
his
advice
oh
dear
me
crow
began
to
gossip
now
gossiping
is
one
of
the
worst
habits
in
all
the
world
one
of
the
very
worst
no
good
ever
comes
of
it
it
just
makes
trouble
trouble
trouble
it
was
so
now
crow
relatives
repeated
the
stories
that
they
heard
but
they
took
great
care
that
no
one
should
know
where
they
came
from
my
my
my
how
trouble
did
spread
on
the
green
meadows
and
in
the
green
forest
no
one
suspected
old
crow
so
he
was
more
in
demand
than
ever
to
straighten
matters
out
his
neighbors
came
to
him
so
much
that
they
began
to
be
ashamed
to
ask
his
advice
for
nothing
so
they
brought
him
presents
so
that
no
more
need
crow
hunt
for
things
to
eat
instead
he
lived
on
the
fat
of
the
land
without
working
and
grew
fat
and
lazy
as
i
have
told
you
crow
was
smart
yes
indeed
he
certainly
was
smart
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
see
that
the
more
trouble
there
was
among
his
neighbors
the
more
they
would
need
his
advice
and
the
more
they
needed
his
advice
the
more
presents
he
would
receive
he
grew
very
crafty
he
would
tell
tales
just
to
make
trouble
and
sometimes
when
he
saw
a
chance
he
would
give
advice
that
he
knew
would
make
more
trouble
the
fact
is
old
crow
became
a
the
very
worst
kind
of
a
and
all
the
time
he
appeared
to
be
the
fine
gentleman
that
he
used
to
be
he
wore
his
fine
white
coat
as
proudly
as
ever
matters
grew
worse
and
worse
never
had
there
been
so
much
trouble
on
the
green
meadows
or
so
many
quarrels
in
the
green
forest
old
mink
never
met
old
mr
otter
without
picking
a
fight
old
mrs
skunk
speak
to
old
coon
old
chipmunk
turned
his
back
on
his
cousin
old
red
squirrel
whenever
their
paths
crossed
even
my
grandfather
a
thousand
times
removed
old
frog
refused
to
see
his
nearest
relative
old
toad
and
all
the
time
old
crow
wore
his
beautiful
suit
of
white
and
grew
rich
and
fat
chuckling
to
himself
over
his
wealth
then
one
day
came
old
mother
nature
to
visit
the
green
meadows
it
did
take
her
long
to
find
that
something
was
wrong
very
wrong
indeed
old
crow
and
all
his
relatives
hastened
to
pay
their
respects
and
to
tell
her
how
much
they
appreciated
their
beautiful
white
suits
old
crow
made
a
full
report
of
all
the
troubles
that
had
been
brought
to
him
but
he
took
great
care
not
to
let
her
know
that
he
had
had
any
part
in
making
trouble
he
looked
very
innocent
oh
very
very
innocent
but
not
once
did
he
look
her
straight
in
the
face
now
the
eyes
of
old
mother
nature
are
wonderfully
sharp
and
they
seemed
to
bore
right
through
old
crow
you
ca
fool
old
mother
nature
no
sir
you
ca
fool
old
mother
nature
and
it
of
no
use
to
try
she
listened
to
all
that
crow
had
to
say
then
she
sent
north
wind
to
blow
his
great
trumpet
and
call
together
all
the
little
people
of
the
green
meadows
and
all
the
little
folks
of
the
green
forest
when
they
had
all
come
together
she
told
them
all
that
had
happened
she
told
just
how
crow
had
started
the
stories
in
order
to
make
trouble
so
that
they
would
seek
his
advice
and
bring
him
presents
to
pay
for
it
when
the
neighbors
of
old
crow
heard
this
they
were
very
angry
and
they
demanded
of
old
mother
nature
that
crow
be
punished
said
old
mother
nature
pointing
at
old
crow
has
been
punished
already
every
one
turned
to
look
at
crow
at
first
they
hardly
knew
him
instead
of
his
suit
of
spotless
white
his
clothes
were
black
as
black
as
the
blackest
night
so
were
the
clothes
of
his
uncles
and
aunts
his
brothers
and
sisters
his
cousins
and
all
his
poor
relations
and
ever
since
that
day
when
the
world
was
young
the
crows
have
been
and
have
worn
black
that
all
who
look
may
know
that
they
bring
nothing
but
trouble
concluded
grandfather
frog
thank
you
thank
you
grandfather
frog
shouted
the
merry
little
breezes
jumping
up
to
go
rock
the
redwing
babies
caw
caw
caw
caw
shouted
blacky
the
crow
flying
over
their
heads
with
a
mouthful
of
corn
he
had
stolen
from
farmer
brown
cornfield
xiii
striped
chipmunk
fools
peter
rabbit
peter
rabbit
sat
at
the
top
of
the
crooked
little
path
where
it
starts
down
the
hill
he
was
sitting
there
when
jolly
round
red
sun
threw
his
nightcap
off
and
began
his
daily
climb
up
into
the
blue
blue
sky
he
saw
old
mother
west
wind
hurry
down
from
the
purple
hills
and
turn
her
merry
little
breezes
out
to
play
on
the
green
meadows
peter
yawned
the
fact
is
peter
had
been
out
nearly
all
night
and
now
he
did
know
just
what
to
do
with
himself
presently
he
saw
striped
chipmunk
whisk
up
on
top
of
an
old
log
as
usual
the
pockets
in
striped
chipmunk
cheeks
were
stuffed
so
full
that
his
head
looked
to
be
twice
as
big
as
it
really
is
and
as
usual
he
seemed
to
be
very
busy
very
busy
indeed
he
stopped
just
long
enough
to
wink
one
of
his
saucy
black
eyes
and
shout
good
morning
peter
rabbit
then
he
disappeared
as
suddenly
as
he
had
come
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
back
on
the
old
log
but
this
time
his
cheeks
were
empty
fine
day
peter
rabbit
said
striped
chipmunk
and
whisked
out
of
sight
peter
rabbit
yawned
again
then
he
closed
his
eyes
for
just
a
minute
when
he
opened
them
there
was
striped
chipmunk
on
the
old
log
just
as
before
and
the
pockets
in
both
cheeks
were
so
full
that
it
seemed
as
if
they
would
burst
nice
morning
to
work
peter
rabbit
said
striped
chipmunk
in
spite
of
his
full
cheeks
then
he
was
gone
once
more
peter
rabbit
closed
his
eyes
but
hardly
were
they
shut
when
striped
chipmunk
shouted
oh
you
peter
rabbit
been
out
all
night
peter
snapped
his
eyes
open
just
in
time
to
see
the
funny
little
tail
of
striped
chipmunk
vanish
over
the
side
of
the
old
log
peter
scratched
one
of
his
long
ears
and
yawned
again
for
peter
was
growing
more
and
more
sleepy
it
was
a
long
yawn
but
peter
cut
it
off
right
in
the
middle
for
there
was
striped
chipmunk
back
on
the
old
log
and
both
pockets
in
his
cheeks
were
stuffed
full
now
peter
rabbit
is
as
curious
as
he
is
lazy
and
you
know
he
is
very
very
lazy
the
fact
is
peter
rabbit
curiosity
is
his
greatest
fault
and
it
gets
him
into
a
great
deal
of
trouble
it
is
because
of
this
and
the
bad
bad
habit
of
meddling
in
the
affairs
of
other
people
into
which
it
has
led
him
that
peter
rabbit
has
such
long
ears
for
a
while
peter
watched
busy
striped
chipmunk
then
he
began
to
wonder
what
striped
chipmunk
could
be
doing
the
more
he
wondered
the
more
he
felt
that
he
really
must
know
the
next
time
striped
chipmunk
appeared
on
the
old
log
peter
shouted
to
him
hi
striped
chipmunk
what
are
you
so
busy
about
why
do
you
play
a
little
striped
chipmunk
stopped
a
minute
i
building
a
new
house
said
he
where
asked
peter
rabbit
that
telling
replied
striped
chipmunk
and
whisked
out
of
sight
now
peter
rabbit
knew
where
reddy
fox
and
jimmy
skunk
and
bobby
coon
and
happy
jack
squirrel
and
johnny
chuck
and
danny
meadow
mouse
lived
he
knew
all
the
little
paths
leading
to
their
homes
but
he
did
not
know
where
striped
chipmunk
lived
he
never
had
known
he
thought
of
this
as
he
watched
striped
chipmunk
hurrying
back
and
forth
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
curious
he
grew
he
really
know
pretty
soon
along
came
jimmy
skunk
looking
for
some
beetles
hello
jimmy
skunk
said
peter
rabbit
hello
peter
rabbit
said
jimmy
skunk
do
you
know
where
striped
chipmunk
lives
asked
peter
rabbit
no
i
do
know
where
striped
chipmunk
lives
and
i
do
care
none
of
my
business
replied
jimmy
skunk
have
you
seen
any
beetles
this
morning
peter
rabbit
had
seen
any
beetles
so
jimmy
skunk
went
on
down
the
crooked
little
path
still
looking
for
his
breakfast
by
and
by
along
came
johnny
chuck
hello
johnny
chuck
said
peter
rabbit
hello
yourself
said
johnny
chuck
do
you
know
where
striped
chipmunk
lives
asked
peter
rabbit
no
i
do
for
it
none
of
my
business
said
johnny
chuck
and
started
on
down
the
crooked
little
path
to
the
green
meadows
then
along
came
bobby
coon
hello
bobby
coon
said
peter
rabbit
hello
replied
bobby
coon
shortly
for
he
too
had
been
out
all
night
and
was
very
sleepy
do
you
know
where
striped
chipmunk
lives
asked
peter
rabbit
do
know
and
do
want
to
it
none
of
my
business
said
bobby
coon
even
more
shortly
than
before
and
started
on
for
his
hollow
chestnut
tree
to
sleep
the
long
bright
day
away
peter
rabbit
could
stand
it
no
longer
curiosity
had
driven
away
all
desire
to
sleep
he
simply
had
to
know
where
striped
chipmunk
lived
i
just
follow
striped
chipmunk
and
see
for
myself
where
he
lives
said
peter
to
himself
so
peter
rabbit
hid
behind
a
tuft
of
grass
close
by
the
old
log
and
sat
very
very
still
it
was
a
very
good
place
to
hide
a
very
good
place
probably
if
peter
rabbit
had
not
been
so
brimming
over
with
curiosity
he
would
have
succeeded
in
escaping
the
sharp
eyes
of
striped
chipmunk
but
people
full
of
curiosity
are
forever
pricking
up
their
ears
to
hear
things
which
do
not
in
the
least
concern
them
it
was
so
with
peter
rabbit
he
was
so
afraid
that
he
would
miss
something
that
both
his
long
ears
were
standing
up
straight
and
they
came
above
the
grass
behind
which
peter
rabbit
was
hiding
of
course
striped
chipmunk
saw
them
the
very
instant
he
jumped
up
on
the
old
log
with
both
pockets
in
his
cheeks
stuffed
full
he
did
say
a
word
but
his
sharp
little
eyes
twinkled
as
he
jumped
off
the
end
of
the
old
log
and
scurried
along
under
the
bushes
for
he
guessed
what
peter
rabbit
was
hiding
for
and
though
he
did
not
once
turn
his
head
he
knew
that
peter
was
following
him
you
see
peter
runs
with
big
jumps
and
people
who
jump
must
make
a
noise
so
though
he
tried
very
hard
not
to
make
a
sound
peter
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
keep
striped
chipmunk
in
sight
that
he
really
made
a
great
deal
of
noise
the
more
noise
peter
made
the
more
striped
chipmunk
chuckled
to
himself
presently
striped
chipmunk
stopped
then
he
sat
up
very
straight
and
looked
this
way
and
looked
that
way
just
as
if
trying
to
make
sure
that
no
one
was
watching
him
then
he
emptied
two
pocketfuls
of
shining
yellow
gravel
on
to
a
nice
new
mound
which
he
was
building
once
more
he
sat
up
and
looked
this
way
and
looked
that
way
then
he
scuttled
back
towards
the
old
log
as
he
ran
striped
chipmunk
chuckled
and
chuckled
to
himself
for
all
the
time
he
had
seen
peter
rabbit
lying
flat
down
behind
a
little
bush
and
knew
that
peter
rabbit
was
thinking
to
himself
how
smart
he
had
been
to
find
striped
chipmunk
home
when
no
one
else
knew
where
it
was
no
sooner
was
striped
chipmunk
out
of
sight
than
up
jumped
peter
rabbit
he
smiled
to
himself
as
he
hurried
over
to
the
shining
mound
of
yellow
gravel
you
see
peter
curiosity
was
so
great
that
not
once
did
he
think
how
mean
he
was
to
spy
on
striped
chipmunk
now
thought
peter
i
know
where
striped
chipmunk
lives
jimmy
skunk
does
know
johnny
chuck
does
know
bobby
coon
does
know
but
know
striped
chipmunk
may
fool
all
the
others
but
he
ca
fool
me
by
this
time
peter
rabbit
had
reached
the
shining
mound
of
yellow
gravel
at
once
he
began
to
hunt
for
the
doorway
to
striped
home
but
there
was
any
doorway
no
sir
there
was
any
doorway
look
as
he
would
peter
rabbit
could
not
find
the
least
sign
of
a
doorway
he
walked
and
the
mound
and
looked
here
and
looked
there
but
not
the
least
sign
of
a
door
was
to
be
seen
there
was
nothing
but
the
shining
mound
of
yellow
gravel
the
green
grass
the
green
bushes
and
the
blue
blue
sky
with
jolly
round
red
sun
looking
down
and
laughing
at
him
peter
rabbit
sat
down
on
striped
chipmunk
shining
mound
of
yellow
gravel
and
scratched
his
left
ear
with
his
left
hindfoot
then
he
scratched
his
right
ear
with
his
right
hindfoot
it
was
very
perplexing
indeed
it
was
so
perplexing
that
peter
quite
forgot
that
striped
chipmunk
would
soon
be
coming
back
suddenly
right
behind
peter
back
striped
chipmunk
spoke
how
do
you
like
my
sand
pile
peter
rabbit
do
you
think
it
is
a
pretty
nice
sand
pile
asked
striped
chipmunk
politely
and
all
the
time
he
was
chuckling
away
to
himself
peter
was
so
surprised
that
he
very
nearly
fell
backward
off
the
shining
mound
of
yellow
gravel
for
a
minute
he
did
know
what
to
say
then
he
found
his
tongue
illustration
peter
was
so
surprised
that
he
nearly
fell
backward
oh
said
peter
rabbit
apparently
in
the
greatest
surprise
is
this
your
sand
pile
striped
chipmunk
it
a
very
nice
sand
pile
indeed
is
this
where
you
live
striped
chipmunk
shook
his
head
no
oh
my
no
said
he
i
think
of
living
in
such
an
exposed
place
my
goodness
no
indeed
everybody
knows
where
this
is
i
building
a
new
home
you
know
and
of
course
i
do
want
the
gravel
to
clutter
up
my
dooryard
so
brought
it
all
here
makes
a
nice
sand
pile
does
it
you
are
very
welcome
to
sit
on
my
sand
pile
whenever
you
feel
like
it
peter
rabbit
it
a
good
place
to
take
a
sun
bath
i
hope
you
come
often
all
the
time
striped
chipmunk
was
saying
this
his
sharp
little
eyes
twinkled
with
mischief
and
he
chuckled
softly
to
himself
peter
rabbit
was
more
curious
than
ever
where
is
your
new
home
striped
chipmunk
he
asked
not
far
from
here
come
call
on
me
said
striped
chipmunk
then
with
a
jerk
of
his
funny
little
tail
he
was
gone
it
seemed
as
if
the
earth
must
have
swallowed
him
up
striped
chipmunk
can
move
very
quickly
and
he
had
whisked
out
of
sight
in
the
bushes
before
peter
rabbit
could
turn
his
head
to
watch
him
peter
looked
behind
every
bush
and
under
every
stone
but
nowhere
could
he
find
striped
chipmunk
or
a
sign
of
striped
chipmunk
home
excepting
the
shining
mound
of
yellow
gravel
at
last
peter
pushed
his
inquisitive
nose
right
into
the
doorway
of
bumble
the
bee
now
bumble
the
bee
happened
to
be
at
home
and
being
very
short
of
temper
he
thrust
a
sharp
little
needle
into
the
inquisitive
nose
of
peter
rabbit
oh
oh
oh
shrieked
peter
clapping
both
hands
to
his
nose
and
started
off
home
as
fast
as
he
could
go
and
though
he
did
know
it
and
does
know
it
to
this
day
he
went
right
across
the
doorstep
of
striped
chipmunk
home
so
peter
still
wonders
and
wonders
where
striped
chipmunk
lives
and
no
one
can
tell
him
not
even
the
merry
little
breezes
you
see
there
is
not
even
a
sign
of
a
path
leading
to
his
doorway
for
striped
chipmunk
never
goes
or
comes
twice
the
same
way
his
doorway
is
very
small
just
large
enough
for
him
to
squeeze
through
and
it
is
so
hidden
in
the
grass
that
often
the
merry
little
breezes
skip
right
over
it
without
seeing
it
every
grain
of
sand
and
gravel
from
the
fine
long
halls
and
snug
chambers
striped
chipmunk
has
built
underground
he
has
carefully
carried
in
the
pockets
in
his
cheeks
to
the
shining
mound
of
yellow
gravel
found
by
peter
rabbit
not
so
much
as
a
grain
is
dropped
on
his
doorstep
to
let
his
secret
out
so
in
and
out
among
the
little
meadow
people
skips
striped
chipmunk
all
the
long
day
and
not
one
has
found
out
where
he
lives
but
no
one
really
cares
excepting
peter
rabbit
who
is
still
curious

made
a
wry
face
and
slid
down
his
slippery
slide
splash
into
the
smiling
pool
throwing
water
all
over
jerry
muskrat
who
was
sitting
on
the
end
of
a
log
close
by
jerry
shook
the
water
from
his
coat
which
is
you

but

grandfather

he
is
talking
about
billy
mink
turned
a
back
somersault
into
the
smiling
pool
so
close
to
the
big
green
on
which
grandfather
frog
sat
that
the
waves
almost
threw
grandfather
frog
into
the
water
pooh
said
billy
mink
how
can
jerry
muskrat
know
anything
more
about
it
than
we
do
grandfather
frog
looked
at
billy
mink
severely
he
does
not
like
billy
mink
who
has
been
known
to
gobble
up
some
of
grandfather
children
when
he
thought
that
no
one
was
looking
old
mother
nature
was
here
and
told
him
said
grandfather
frog
gruffly
oh
exclaimed
billy
mink
and
little
joe
otter
together
different
and
they
looked
at
jerry
muskrat
with
greater
respect
how
are
you
going
to
prepare
for
the
long
cold
winter
jerry
muskrat
asked
one
of
the
merry
little
breezes
i
going
to
build
a
house
a
big
warm
house
replied
jerry
muskrat
and
i
going
to
begin
right
now
illustration
i
going
to
build
a
house
replied
jerry
muskrat
splash
jerry
had
disappeared
into
the
smiling
pool
presently
over
on
the
far
side
where
the
water
was
shallow
it
began
to
bubble
and
boil
as
if
a
great
fuss
was
going
on
underneath
the
surface
jerry
muskrat
had
begun
work
the
water
grew
muddy
very
muddy
indeed
so
muddy
that
little
joe
otter
and
billy
mink
climbed
out
on
the
big
rock
in
disgust
when
finally
jerry
muskrat
swam
out
to
rest
on
the
end
of
a
log
they
shouted
to
him
angrily
hi
jerry
muskrat
you
spoiling
our
swimming
water
what
are
you
doing
anyway
i
digging
for
the
foundations
for
my
new
house
and
it
is
your
water
any
more
than
it
mine
replied
jerry
muskrat
drawing
a
long
breath
before
he
disappeared
under
water
again
the
water
grew
muddier
and
muddier
until
even
grandfather
frog
began
to
look
annoyed
billy
mink
and
little
joe
otter
started
off
up
the
laughing
brook
where
the
water
was
clear
the
merry
little
breezes
danced
away
across
the
green
meadows
to
play
with
johnny
chuck
and
grandfather
frog
settled
himself
comfortably
on
his
big
green
to
dream
of
the
days
when
the
world
was
young
and
the
frogs
ruled
the
world
but
jerry
muskrat
worked
steadily
digging
and
piling
sods
in
a
circle
for
the
foundation
of
his
house
in
the
center
he
dug
out
a
chamber
from
which
he
planned
a
long
tunnel
to
his
secret
burrow
far
away
in
the
bank
and
another
to
the
deepest
part
of
the
smiling
pool
where
even
in
the
coldest
weather
the
water
would
not
freeze
to
the
bottom
as
it
would
do
in
the
shallow
places
all
day
long
while
billy
mink
and
little
joe
otter
and
the
merry
little
breezes
and
johnny
chuck
and
peter
rabbit
and
danny
meadow
mouse
and
all
the
other
little
meadow
people
were
playing
or
lazily
taking
sun
naps
jerry
muskrat
worked
steadily
jolly
round
red
sun
looking
down
from
the
blue
blue
sky
smiled
to
see
how
industrious
the
little
fellow
was
that
evening
when
old
mother
west
wind
hurried
across
the
green
meadows
on
her
way
to
her
home
behind
the
purple
hills
she
found
jerry
muskrat
sitting
on
the
end
of
a
log
eating
his
supper
of
clams
showing
just
above
the
water
on
the
edge
of
the
smiling
pool
was
the
foundation
of
jerry
muskrat
new
house
the
next
morning
jerry
was
up
and
at
work
even
before
old
mother
west
wind
who
is
a
very
early
riser
came
down
from
the
purple
hills
of
course
every
one
was
interested
to
see
how
the
new
house
was
coming
along
and
to
offer
advice
are
you
going
to
build
it
all
of
mud
asked
one
of
the
merry
little
breezes
no
said
jerry
muskrat
i
going
to
use
green
alder
twigs
and
willow
shoots
and
bulrush
stalks
it
going
to
be
two
stories
high
with
a
room
down
deep
under
water
and
another
room
up
above
with
a
beautiful
bed
of
grass
and
soft
moss
that
will
be
splendid
cried
the
merry
little
breezes
then
one
of
them
had
an
idea
he
whispered
to
the
other
little
breezes
they
all
giggled
and
clapped
their
hands
then
they
hurried
off
to
find
billy
mink
and
little
joe
otter
they
even
hunted
up
johnny
chuck
and
peter
rabbit
and
danny
meadow
mouse
jerry
muskrat
was
so
busy
that
he
paid
no
attention
to
any
one
or
anything
else
he
was
attending
strictly
to
the
business
of
building
a
house
that
would
keep
him
warm
and
comfortable
when
the
long
cold
winter
should
freeze
up
tight
the
smiling
pool
pretty
soon
he
was
ready
for
some
green
twigs
to
use
in
the
walls
of
the
new
house
he
swam
across
the
smiling
pool
to
the
laughing
brook
where
the
alders
grow
to
cut
the
green
twigs
which
he
needed
what
do
you
think
he
found
when
he
got
there
why
the
nicest
little
pile
of
green
twigs
all
cut
ready
to
use
and
johnny
chuck
cutting
more
hello
jerry
muskrat
said
johnny
chuck
i
cut
all
these
green
twigs
for
your
new
house
i
hope
you
can
use
them
jerry
was
so
surprised
that
he
hardly
knew
what
to
say
he
thanked
johnny
chuck
and
with
the
bundle
of
green
twigs
swam
back
to
his
new
house
when
he
had
used
the
last
one
he
swam
across
to
the
bulrushes
on
the
edge
of
the
smiling
pool
good
morning
jerry
muskrat
said
some
one
almost
hidden
by
a
big
pile
of
bulrushes
all
nicely
cut
i
want
to
help
build
the
new
house
it
was
danny
meadow
mouse
jerry
muskrat
was
more
surprised
than
ever
oh
thank
you
danny
meadow
mouse
thank
you
he
said
and
pushing
the
pile
of
bulrushes
before
him
he
swam
back
to
his
new
house
when
he
had
used
the
rushes
jerry
wanted
some
young
willow
shoots
so
he
started
for
the
place
where
the
willows
grow
before
he
reached
them
he
heard
some
one
shouting
hi
jerry
muskrat
see
the
pile
of
willow
shoots
i
cut
for
your
new
house
it
was
peter
rabbit
who
is
never
known
to
work
jerry
muskrat
was
more
surprised
than
ever
and
so
pleased
that
all
he
could
say
was
thank
you
thank
you
peter
rabbit
back
to
the
new
house
he
swam
with
the
pile
of
young
willow
shoots
when
he
had
placed
them
to
suit
him
he
sat
up
on
the
walls
of
his
house
to
rest
he
looked
across
the
smiling
pool
then
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
again
could
it
be
yes
it
certainly
was
a
bundle
of
green
alder
twigs
floating
straight
across
the
smiling
pool
towards
the
new
house
when
they
got
close
to
him
jerry
spied
a
sharp
little
black
nose
pushing
them
along
and
back
of
the
little
black
nose
twinkled
two
little
black
eyes
what
are
you
doing
with
those
alder
twigs
billy
mink
cried
jerry
bringing
them
for
your
new
house
shouted
billy
mink
popping
out
from
behind
the
bundle
of
alder
twigs
and
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
busiest
day
that
the
smiling
pool
had
ever
known
billy
mink
brought
more
alder
twigs
and
willow
shoots
and
bulrushes
as
fast
as
johnny
chuck
and
peter
rabbit
and
danny
meadow
mouse
could
cut
them
little
joe
otter
brought
sods
and
mud
to
hold
them
in
place
thick
and
high
grew
the
walls
of
the
new
house
in
the
upper
part
jerry
built
the
nicest
little
room
and
lined
it
with
grass
and
soft
moss
so
that
he
could
sleep
warm
and
comfortable
through
the
long
cold
winter
over
all
he
built
a
strong
thick
roof
beautifully
rounded
an
hour
before
it
was
time
for
old
mother
west
wind
to
come
for
the
merry
little
breezes
jerry
muskrat
new
house
was
finished
then
such
a
frolic
as
there
was
in
and
around
the
smiling
pool
little
joe
otter
made
a
new
slippery
slide
down
one
side
of
the
roof
billy
mink
said
that
the
new
house
was
better
to
dive
off
of
than
the
big
rock
then
the
two
of
them
with
jerry
muskrat
cut
up
all
sorts
of
in
the
water
while
johnny
chuck
peter
rabbit
danny
meadow
mouse
and
the
merry
little
breezes
danced
on
the
shore
and
shouted
themselves
hoarse
when
at
last
jolly
round
red
sun
went
to
bed
behind
the
purple
hills
and
the
black
shadows
crept
ever
so
softly
out
across
the
smiling
pool
jerry
muskrat
sat
on
the
roof
of
his
house
eating
his
supper
of
clams
he
was
very
tired
was
jerry
muskrat
very
tired
indeed
but
he
was
very
happy
for
now
he
had
no
fear
of
the
long
cold
winter
best
of
all
his
heart
was
full
of
love
love
for
his
little
playmates
of
the
smiling
pool
and
the
green
meadows
xv
peter
rabbit
big
cousin
jumper
the
hare
had
come
down
out
of
the
great
woods
to
the
green
meadows
he
is
first
cousin
to
peter
rabbit
you
know
and
he
looks
just
like
peter
only
he
is
twice
as
big
his
legs
are
twice
as
long
and
he
can
jump
twice
as
far
all
the
little
meadow
people
were
very
polite
to
jumper
the
hare
all
but
reddy
fox
who
is
never
polite
to
any
one
unless
he
has
a
favor
to
ask
peter
rabbit
was
very
proud
of
his
big
cousin
very
proud
indeed
he
showed
jumper
the
hare
all
the
secret
paths
in
the
green
forest
and
across
the
green
meadows
he
took
him
to
the
smiling
pool
and
the
laughing
brook
and
everywhere
jumper
the
hare
was
met
with
the
greatest
politeness
but
jumper
the
hare
was
timid
oh
very
timid
indeed
every
few
jumps
he
sat
up
very
straight
to
look
this
way
and
look
that
way
and
to
listen
with
his
long
ears
he
jumped
nervously
at
the
least
little
noise
yes
sir
jumper
the
hare
certainly
was
very
timid
he
a
coward
sneered
reddy
fox
and
billy
mink
and
little
joe
otter
and
jimmy
skunk
even
johnny
chuck
seeing
jumper
the
hare
duck
and
dodge
at
the
shadow
of
blacky
the
crow
agreed
with
reddy
fox
still
they
were
polite
to
him
for
the
sake
of
peter
rabbit
and
because
jumper
really
was
such
a
big
handsome
fellow
but
behind
his
back
they
laughed
at
him
even
little
danny
meadow
mouse
laughed
now
it
happens
that
jumper
the
hare
had
lived
all
his
life
in
the
great
woods
where
panther
and
tufty
the
lynx
and
fierce
fisher
were
always
hunting
him
but
where
the
shadows
were
deep
and
where
there
were
plenty
of
places
to
hide
indeed
his
whole
life
had
been
a
game
of
hide
and
seek
and
always
he
had
been
the
one
sought
so
on
the
green
meadows
where
hiding
places
were
few
and
far
between
jumper
the
hare
was
nervous
but
the
little
meadow
people
not
knowing
this
thought
him
a
coward
and
while
they
were
polite
to
him
they
had
little
to
do
with
him
for
no
one
really
likes
a
coward
peter
rabbit
however
could
see
no
fault
in
his
big
cousin
he
showed
him
where
farmer
brown
tender
young
carrots
grow
and
the
shortest
way
to
the
cabbage
patch
he
made
him
acquainted
with
all
his
own
secret
hiding
places
in
the
old
brier
patch
then
one
bright
sunny
morning
something
happened
johnny
chuck
saw
it
jimmy
skunk
saw
it
happy
jack
squirrel
saw
it
sammy
jay
saw
it
and
they
told
all
the
others
very
early
that
morning
reddy
fox
had
started
out
to
hunt
for
his
breakfast
he
was
tiptoeing
softly
along
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
looking
for
wood
mice
when
whom
should
he
see
but
peter
rabbit
peter
was
getting
his
breakfast
in
the
bed
just
beyond
the
old
brier
patch
reddy
fox
squatted
down
behind
a
bush
to
watch
peter
rabbit
looked
plump
and
fat
reddy
fox
licked
his
chops
peter
rabbit
would
make
a
better
breakfast
than
wood
mice
a
very
much
better
breakfast
said
reddy
fox
to
himself
beside
he
owed
peter
rabbit
a
grudge
he
had
not
forgotten
how
peter
had
tried
to
save
his
little
brother
from
reddy
by
bringing
up
bowser
the
hound
reddy
fox
licked
his
chops
again
he
looked
this
way
and
he
looked
that
way
but
he
could
see
no
one
watching
old
mother
west
wind
had
gone
about
her
business
the
merry
little
breezes
were
over
at
the
smiling
pool
to
pay
their
respects
to
grandfather
frog
even
jolly
round
red
sun
was
behind
a
cloud
from
his
hiding
place
reddy
could
not
see
johnny
chuck
or
jimmy
skunk
or
happy
jack
squirrel
or
sammy
jay
no
one
will
know
what
becomes
of
peter
rabbit
thought
reddy
fox
very
cautiously
reddy
fox
crept
out
from
behind
the
bush
into
the
tall
meadow
grass
flat
on
his
stomach
he
crawled
inch
by
inch
every
few
minutes
he
stopped
to
listen
and
to
peep
over
at
the
bed
there
sat
peter
rabbit
eating
eating
eating
the
tender
young
clover
as
if
he
had
a
care
in
the
world
but
to
fill
his
little
round
stomach
nearer
and
nearer
crawled
reddy
fox
now
he
was
almost
near
enough
to
spring
thump
thump
thump
the
sound
came
from
the
brier
patch
thump
thump
this
was
peter
rabbit
hitting
the
ground
with
one
of
his
hind
feet
he
had
stopped
eating
and
was
sitting
up
very
straight
thump
thump
thump
came
the
signal
from
the
brier
patch
thump
thump
responded
peter
rabbit
and
started
to
run
with
a
snarl
reddy
fox
sprang
after
him
then
the
thing
happened
reddy
fox
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
going
over
him
and
at
the
same
time
he
received
a
blow
that
rolled
him
over
and
over
in
the
grass
in
an
instant
he
was
on
his
feet
and
had
whirled
about
his
eyes
yellow
with
anger
there
right
in
front
of
him
sat
jumper
the
hare
reddy
fox
could
hardly
believe
his
own
eyes
could
it
be
that
jumper
the
hare
the
coward
had
dared
to
strike
him
such
a
blow
reddy
forgot
all
about
peter
rabbit
with
a
snarl
he
rushed
at
jumper
the
hare
then
it
happened
again
as
light
as
a
feather
jumper
leaped
over
him
and
as
he
passed
those
big
hind
legs
at
which
reddy
fox
had
laughed
came
back
with
a
kick
that
knocked
all
the
breath
out
of
reddy
fox
reddy
fox
was
furious
twice
more
he
sprang
and
twice
more
he
was
sent
sprawling
with
the
breath
knocked
out
of
his
body
that
was
enough
tucking
his
tail
between
his
legs
reddy
fox
sneaked
away
towards
the
green
forest
as
he
ran
he
heard
peter
rabbit
thumping
in
the
old
brier
patch
i
safe
signaled
peter
rabbit
thump
thump
thump
thump
the
coast
is
clear
replied
jumper
the
hare
reddy
fox
looked
back
from
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
and
gnashed
his
teeth
peter
rabbit
and
jumper
the
hare
were
rubbing
noses
and
contentedly
eating
tender
young
clover
leaves
now
who
the
coward
jeered
sammy
jay
from
the
top
of
the
lone
pine
reddy
fox
said
nothing
but
slunk
out
of
sight
late
that
afternoon
he
sat
on
the
hill
at
the
top
of
the
crooked
little
path
and
looked
down
on
the
green
meadows
over
near
the
smiling
pool
were
gathered
all
the
little
meadow
people
having
the
jolliest
time
in
the
world
while
he
watched
they
joined
hands
in
a
big
circle
