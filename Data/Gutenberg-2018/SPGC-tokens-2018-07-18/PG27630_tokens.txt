pure

sleepy
hollow
she
stood
at
her
bedroom
window
before
going
downstairs
to
take
up
the
burden
of
a
new
day
she
was
just
seventeen
but
they
did
not
keep
any
account
of
anniversaries
at
hickory
farm
the
sun
had
given
her
a
loving
glance
as
he
lifted
his
bright
old
face
above
the
horizon
but
her
father
was
too
busy
and
careworn
to
remember
and
since
her
mother
had
gone
away
there
was
no
one
else
she
had
read
of
the
birthdays
of
other
girls
full
of
strange
sweet
surprises
and
tender
thoughts
but
those
were
girls
with
mothers
a
smile
like
a
stray
beam
of
sunshine
drifted
over
her
troubled
young
face
at
the
thought
of
the
second
mrs
harding
stopping
for
one
instant
in
her
round
of
ponderous
toil
to
note
the
fact
that
one
of
her
family
had
reached
another
milestone
in
life
journey
certainly
not
on
washing
day
when
every
energy
was
absorbed
in
the
elimination
of
impurity
from
her
household
linen
and
life
looked
grotesque
and
hazy
through
clouds
of
soapy
steam
she
heard
her
father
now
putting
on
the
heavy
pots
of
water
and
then
watched
him
cross
the
to
the
barn
how
bent
and
old
he
looked
did
he
ever
repent
of
his
step
she
wondered
life
could
not
be
much
to
him
any
more
than
it
was
to
her
and
he
had
known
her
mother
oh
why
could
he
not
have
waited
she
would
soon
have
been
old
enough
to
keep
house
for
him
the
minister
had
spoken
the
day
before
of
a
heaven
where
people
were
presumably
to
find
their
height
of
enjoyment
in
an
eternity
of
rest
she
supposed
that
was
the
best
of
it
old
mrs
goodenough
was
always
sighing
for
rest
and
deacon
croaker
prayed
every
week
to
be
set
free
from
the
trials
and
tribulations
of
this
present
evil
world
and
brought
into
everlasting
peace
an
endless
passivity
seemed
a
dreary
outlook
to
her
active
soul
which
was
sighing
to
plume
its
cramped
wings
and
soar
among
the
endless
possibilities
of
earth
it
seemed
strange
that
there
should
be
no
wonders
to
explore
in
heaven
well
death
was
sure
anyway
and
after
all
there
was
nothing
in
life
her
life
but
hard
work
an
round
of
the
same
thing
she
thought
she
could
have
stood
it
better
if
there
had
been
variety
death
was
sure
to
come
sometime
but
people
lived
to
be
eighty
and
she
was
so
very
young
still
perhaps
monotony
might
prove
as
fatal
as
heart
failure
she
thought
it
would
with
her
she
was
so
terribly
tired
ever
since
she
could
remember
she
had
looked
out
of
this
same
window
as
the
sun
rose
and
wondered
if
something
would
happen
to
her
as
it
did
to
other
girls
but
the
day
went
past
in
the
same
dull
routine
so
many
plates
to
wash
and
the
darning
basket
seemed
to
grow
larger
each
year
and
the
babies
were
so
heavy
she
had
read
somewhere
that
earnest
pure
unselfish
men
who
lived
their
lives
well
helped
to
form
the
hero
god
let
none
of
them
be
wasted
a
thousand
unrecorded
patriots
helped
to
make
wellington
it
seemed
to
her
wellington
had
the
best
of
it
me
git
dressed
demanded
lemuel
her
youngest
from
his
trundle
bed
loiterin
why
ai
you
down
helping
mar
mar
be
awful
cross
with
you
she
always
is
wash
days
hi
you
git
it
and
he
endeavoured
to
suspend
himself
from
a
chair
by
his
braces
and
get
your
face
washed
lemuel
now
do
wiggle
you
know
you
got
to
say
your
prayers
before
you
can
go
down
be
bovvered
retorted
that
worthy
as
he
squirmed
into
his
jacket
like
an
eel
and
darted
past
her
as
hungry
as
wobinson
crusoe
an
i
goin
to
tell
mar
how
you
loiterin
she
followed
him
sadly
she
had
forgotten
to
say
her
own
minutes
late
said
mrs
harding
severely
as
she
entered
the
kitchen
hev
to
be
extry
spry
to
make
up
there
pertaters
to
be
fried
an
the
children
lunches
to
put
up
an
john
lost
his
jography
i
believe
that
boy
lose
his
head
if
it
glued
to
his
shoulders
there
a
button
off
stephen
collar
an
susan
ann
wants
her
hair
curled
an
polly
frettin
to
be
taken
up
it
beats
me
how
that
child
does
fret
i
believe
i
put
her
to
sleep
with
you
after
this
i
that
beat
out
i
can
hardly
stand
leander
go
and
call
your
father
or
you
be
late
for
school
again
an
your
teacher
be
sending
in
more
complaints
all
them
teachers
is
good
for
anyway
settin
like
ladies
twiddling
at
the
leaves
of
a
book
an
thinkin
themselves
somethin
fine
because
they
know
a
few
words
of
latin
an
can
figure
with
an
algebry
is
all
very
fine
in
its
way
but
i
guess
plain
arithmetic
is
good
enough
for
most
folks
it
all
i
was
brought
up
on
an
the
multiplication
table
has
kept
me
on
a
level
with
the
majority
pauline
smiled
to
herself
as
she
cut
generous
slices
of
pumpkin
pie
to
go
with
the
doughnuts
and
bread
and
butter
in
the
different
dinner
pails
that
was
just
what
tired
her
being
a
level
with
the
majority
the
long
morning
wore
itself
away
pauline
toiled
bravely
over
the
endless
array
of
pinafores
which
the
youthful
hardings
managed
to
make
unpresentable
in
a
week
even
in
gingham
she
murmured
for
polly
were
all
of
pink
check
lemuel
blue
and
leander
a
dull
brown
sortin
had
been
the
brief
response
when
she
had
suggested
varying
the
colours
in
order
to
cultivate
the
æsthetic
instinct
in
the
wearers
mrs
harding
she
remonstrated
say
now
that
it
is
possible
for
even
to
lower
the
moral
tone
of
a
child
and
lead
to
crime
her
turned
on
her
a
look
of
withering
scorn
your
hifalutin
people
mean
to
say
that
if
i
do
get
papering
to
suit
their
notions
i
will
make
my
boys
thieves
an
liars
then
well
for
us
the
walls
is
covered
with
sensible
green
paint
that
is
killing
time
an
next
week
we
must
try
out
the
tallow
you
can
be
as
æsthetic
as
you
a
mind
to
with
the
and
candles
pauline
never
attempted
after
that
to
elevate
the
moral
tone
of
her
her
father
came
in
at
with
a
letter
he
handed
it
over
to
her
as
she
sat
beside
him
from
your
uncle
robert
my
dear
in
boston
his
folks
think
time
they
got
to
know
their
cousin
i
hope
they
not
comin
trailin
down
here
with
their
city
airs
said
mrs
harding
shortly
got
enough
people
under
my
feet
as
it
is
need
worry
mother
i
do
think
sleepy
hollow
would
suit
robert
family
they
pretty
lively
i
take
it
and
up
with
the
times
they
find
us
small
potatoes
not
worth
the
hoeing
he
sighed
as
he
spoke
did
he
remember
how
pauline
mother
had
drooped
and
died
from
this
very
dulness
was
he
glad
to
have
her
child
escape
i
do
see
how
there
any
other
way
for
them
to
get
acquainted
retorted
his
wife
ca
be
spared
to
go
trapesing
up
to
boston
her
head
as
full
of
nonsense
now
as
an
egg
is
of
meat
an
she
would
know
a
broom
from
a
after
she
been
philandering
round
a
couple
of
months
with
people
that
are
never
satisfied
unless
they
peeking
into
something
they
understand
i
guess
we
have
to
spare
pauline
said
mr
harding
has
been
a
good
girl
and
she
deserves
a
holiday
he
patted
pauline
hand
kindly
of
course
sniffed
mrs
harding
in
high
dudgeon
folks
must
always
have
what
they
cry
for
i
can
be
kep
awake
nights
with
the
baby
and
work
like
a
slave
in
the
day
time
but
that
does
signify
as
long
as
pawliney
gets
to
her
grand
relations
well
wife
said
mr
harding
soothingly
wo
be
as
bad
as
you
think
for
you
can
get
martha
spriggs
to
help
with
the
chores
and
the
children
will
soon
be
older
young
folks
must
have
a
turn
you
know
and
i
shall
write
to
robert
and
tell
him
pawliney
will
be
along
shortly
that
is
if
you
like
to
go
my
dear
pauline
turned
on
him
a
face
so
radiant
that
he
was
satisfied
and
the
rest
of
the
meal
was
taken
in
silence
mrs
harding
knew
when
her
husband
made
up
his
mind
about
a
thing
she
could
not
change
him
so
she
said
no
more
but
pauline
felt
she
was
very
angry
as
for
herself
she
seemed
to
walk
on
air
at
last
after
all
these
years
something
had
happened
she
stepped
about
the
dim
kitchen
exultantly
could
this
be
the
same
girl
who
had
found
life
intolerable
only
two
hours
before
now
the
aladdin
wand
of
kindly
fortune
had
opened
before
her
dazzled
eyes
a
mine
of
golden
possibilities
at
last
she
would
have
a
chance
to
breathe
and
live
she
arranged
the
common
heavy
ware
on
the
shelves
with
a
strange
sense
of
freedom
she
would
be
done
with
soon
she
even
found
it
in
her
heart
to
pity
her
who
was
giving
vent
to
her
suppressed
wrath
in
mighty
strokes
of
her
through
a
large
bowl
of
buckwheat
batter
she
was
not
going
to
boston
when
the
chores
were
done
she
caught
up
the
fretful
polly
and
carried
her
upstairs
saying
the
magic
name
over
softly
to
herself
she
even
found
it
easy
to
be
patient
with
lemuel
as
he
put
her
through
her
nightly
torture
before
he
fell
into
the
arms
of
morpheus
she
did
not
mind
much
if
polly
was
wakeful
she
knew
she
should
never
close
her
eyes
all
night
the
soft
spring
air
floated
in
through
the
open
window
and
she
heard
the
birds
twitter
and
the
frogs
peep
she
heard
abraham
lincoln
the
old
horse
that
she
used
to
ride
to
water
before
she
grew
big
enough
to
work
whinney
over
his
hay
and
goliath
the
young
giant
that
had
come
to
take
his
place
in
the
farm
work
answer
him
sonorously
the
dog
barked
lazily
as
a
nighthawk
swept
by
and
in
the
distant
she
heard
a
rooster
crow
her
pity
grew
until
it
rested
like
a
benison
upon
all
her
humble
friends
for
they
must
remain
in
sleepy
hollow
and
she
was
going
away
a
bill
suppose
you
be
wanting
some
finery
little
girl
said
mr
harding
the
next
morning
as
he
pushed
away
his
chair
from
the
breakfast
table
is
the
first
consideration
is
it
with
women
do
know
about
the
finery
father
and
pauline
laughed
a
little
expect
i
shall
be
satisfied
with
the
essentials
mr
harding
crossed
the
room
to
an
secretary
which
stood
in
one
corner
coming
back
he
held
out
to
her
a
bill
this
answer
money
is
terrible
tight
just
now
and
the
mortgage
falls
due
next
week
it
hard
work
keeping
the
wolf
away
these
dull
times
pauline
forced
her
lips
to
form
a
you
as
she
put
the
in
her
pocket
and
then
began
silently
to
clear
the
table
her
thoughts
in
a
tumultuous
whirl
ten
dollars
her
father
hired
man
received
a
dollar
a
day
she
had
been
working
hard
for
years
and
had
received
nothing
but
the
barest
necessaries
in
the
way
of
clothing
purchased
under
mrs
harding
economical
eye
when
martha
spriggs
came
to
take
her
place
she
would
have
her
regular
wages
were
hired
helpers
the
only
ones
whose
labour
was
deemed
worthy
of
reward
dresses
and
hats
and
boots
and
gloves
absolute
essentials
with
a
vengeance
and
ten
dollars
to
cover
the
whole
can
have
abraham
lincoln
and
the
spring
waggon
this
afternoon
if
you
want
to
go
to
the
village
for
your
gewgaws
well
father
do
suppose
you
rest
easy
till
you
made
the
dollars
fly
that
the
way
with
girls
eh
as
long
as
they
can
have
a
lot
of
flimsy
laces
and
ribbons
and
flowers
they
as
happy
as
birds
well
well
young
folks
must
have
their
fling
i
suppose
i
hope
you
enjoy
your
shopping
my
dear
and
mr
harding
started
for
the
barn
serene
in
the
consciousness
that
he
had
made
his
daughter
happy
in
the
ability
to
purchase
an
unlimited
supply
of
the
unnecessary
things
which
girls
delight
in
are
a
grateful
piece
i
must
say
remarked
her
as
she
administered
some
catnip
tea
to
the
whining
polly
have
seen
the
colour
of
a
bill
in
as
many
years
and
you
put
it
in
your
pocket
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
and
go
about
looking
as
glum
as
a
herring
who
going
to
do
the
clothes
i
like
to
know
i
ca
lay
this
child
out
of
my
arms
for
a
minute
i
believe
she
sickening
for
a
fever
and
then
perhaps
your
fine
relations
wo
be
so
anxious
to
see
you
coming
for
my
part
i
would
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
knuckle
to
people
who
waited
seventeen
years
to
find
whether
i
was
in
the
land
of
the
living
before
they
said
how
d
do
but
then
i
always
was
i
despise
meachin
folks
guess
i
can
get
most
of
the
ironing
done
this
morning
if
you
see
to
the
dinner
said
pauline
as
she
put
the
irons
on
the
stove
and
went
into
another
room
for
the
heavy
basket
of
folded
clothes
dresses
and
hats
and
boots
and
gloves
the
words
kept
recurring
to
her
inner
consciousness
with
a
persistent
regularity
she
wondered
what
girls
felt
like
who
could
buy
what
they
did
not
need
she
thought
it
must
be
like
heaven
but
not
deacon
croaker
kind
that
looked
less
attractive
than
ever
this
morning
as
she
passed
mrs
harding
chair
polly
put
up
her
hands
to
be
taken
but
her
mother
caught
her
back
no
pawliney
has
got
any
more
use
for
plain
folks
polly
going
to
do
herself
proud
shoppin
so
she
can
go
to
boston
and
strut
about
like
a
frilled
peacock
you
have
to
be
satisfied
with
your
mother
polly
pawliney
does
care
anything
about
you
now
pauline
laughed
bitterly
to
herself
frilled
peacock
with
a
outfit
she
began
the
interminable
pinafores
the
sun
swept
up
the
horizon
and
laughed
at
her
so
broadly
through
the
open
window
that
her
cheeks
grew
flushed
and
uncomfortable
lemuel
burst
into
the
room
in
riotous
distress
with
a
bruised
knee
the
result
of
his
attempt
to
imitate
the
prodigal
son
which
had
ended
in
an
ignominious
tumble
into
the
midst
of
his
swinish
friends
this
caused
a
delay
for
he
had
to
be
hurried
out
to
the
back
stoop
and
divested
of
garments
as
odorous
if
not
as
ragged
as
those
of
his
prototype
then
he
must
be
immersed
in
a
hot
bath
his
knee
bound
up
reclothed
in
a
fresh
suit
and
comforted
with
bread
and
molasses
she
toiled
wearily
on
the
room
grew
almost
unbearable
as
her
made
up
the
fire
preparatory
to
cooking
the
noontide
meal
and
polly
wailed
dismally
from
her
cot
the
youthful
prodigal
appeared
again
in
the
doorway
his
ready
tears
had
made
miniature
deltas
over
his
countenance
his
lower
lip
hung
down
in
an
impotent
despair
the
matter
now
lemuel
want
my
best
shoes
an
a
wing
on
my
finger
an
the
axe
to
kill
the
fatted
calf
would
the
basket
never
be
empty
her
head
began
to
throb
and
she
felt
as
if
her
body
were
an
ache
personified
the
mingled
odours
of
corned
beef
and
cabbage
issued
from
one
of
the
pots
and
permeated
the
freshly
ironed
clothes
she
drew
a
long
deep
breath
of
disgust
at
least
in
boston
she
would
be
free
from
the
horrors
of
dinner
her
scanty
wardrobe
was
finished
at
last
and
she
stood
waiting
for
abraham
lincoln
and
the
spring
waggon
to
carry
her
to
the
station
a
strange
tenderness
towards
her
old
environment
came
over
her
as
she
stood
on
the
threshold
of
the
great
unknown
she
looked
lovingly
at
the
cows
lazily
chewing
their
cud
in
the
sunshine
she
felt
sorry
for
her
as
she
strove
to
woo
slumber
to
polly
wakeful
eyes
with
the
same
lullaby
which
had
done
duty
for
the
whole
six
she
even
found
it
in
her
heart
to
kiss
lemuel
who
with
his
ready
talent
for
the
unusual
was
busily
cramming
mud
paste
into
the
seams
of
the
little
trunk
which
held
her
worldly
all
she
looked
at
it
with
contemptuous
pity
poor
old
thing
you
feel
as
small
as
i
shall
among
the
saratogas
and
the
style
well
i
be
honest
from
the
start
and
tell
them
that
the
only
thing
we
rich
in
is
mortgages
i
guess
they
know
without
the
telling
i
wonder
if
they
be
ashamed
of
me
her
father
came
and
lifted
the
trunk
into
the
back
of
the
waggon
and
they
started
along
the
road
to
the
station
he
began
recalling
the
city
as
he
remembered
it
have
to
go
to
bunker
hill
of
course
and
the
common
and
be
sure
and
look
out
for
the
statues
they
everywhere
lincoln
freeing
the
slaves
that
the
best
one
to
my
thinking
and
that
down
in
cornhill
if
i
remember
right
my
but
that
a
place
mind
you
hold
tight
to
your
cousins
the
streets
and
the
horses
and
the
people
whirl
round
so
it
enough
to
make
you
lose
your
head
well
well
i
mind
going
along
with
you
to
see
the
sights
he
bought
her
ticket
and
secured
her
a
comfortable
seat
then
he
said
bless
you
and
went
away
pauline
looked
after
him
wonderingly
he
had
never
said
it
to
her
before
perhaps
it
was
a
figure
of
speech
which
people
reserved
for
travelling
she
supposed
there
was
always
the
danger
of
a
possible
accident
ah
if
they
could
only
have
started
off
together
as
he
said
and
never
gone
back
to
sleepy
hollow
any
more
fairyland
to
the
day
of
her
death
pauline
never
forgot
the
sense
of
satisfied
delight
with
which
she
felt
herself
made
a
member
of
her
household
her
three
cousins
gwendolyn
russell
and
belle
had
greeted
her
cordially
as
soon
as
the
train
drew
up
in
a
station
which
for
size
and
grandeur
surpassed
her
wildest
dreams
and
then
escorted
her
between
a
bewildering
panorama
of
flashing
lights
brilliant
shop
windows
swiftly
moving
cars
and
people
in
an
endless
stream
to
another
depot
for
her
uncle
robert
resided
in
the
suburbs
they
were
waiting
to
welcome
her
at
the
entrance
of
their
lovely
home
her
uncle
robert
and
his
wife
with
one
swift
comprehensive
glance
she
took
it
all
in
the
handsome
house
in
its
brilliant
setting
of
lawns
and
trees
the
wide
verandah
with
its
crimson
mount
washington
rockers
luxurious
hammocks
and
low
table
covered
with
magazines
the
man
who
was
her
nearest
of
kin
and
his
graceful
wife
in
a
of
soft
summer
silk
with
rich
lace
about
her
throat
and
wrists
her
cousins
in
their
dainty
muslins
and
russell
in
his
fresh
summer
suit
here
at
least
were
people
who
knew
what
it
was
to
live
we
have
really
got
our
little
country
blossom
transplanted
said
her
uncle
as
he
kissed
her
warmly
have
so
often
begged
your
father
to
let
you
come
to
us
before
but
he
always
wrote
that
you
could
not
be
spared
a
hot
flush
burnt
its
way
up
over
her
cheeks
and
brow
and
he
had
let
her
think
all
this
time
that
they
had
not
cared
her
own
father
he
might
at
least
have
trusted
her
she
started
for
her
uncle
was
saying
is
your
aunt
rutha
my
dear
and
turned
to
be
clasped
in
tender
arms
and
hear
a
sweet
voice
whisper
the
introduction
loved
your
mother
and
then
she
had
been
taken
upstairs
by
the
lively
belle
to
refresh
herself
after
her
journey
and
prepare
for
dinner
which
had
been
delayed
until
her
arrival
the
dinner
itself
was
a
revelation
the
snowy
table
with
its
silver
dishes
and
graceful
of
blooms
the
crystal
sparkling
in
the
rosy
glow
cast
by
massively
carved
lamps
the
perfect
noiseless
serving
and
the
bright
conversation
which
flowed
freely
little
hindered
by
the
different
courses
of
soup
and
fish
and
game
and
ices
conversation
about
things
that
were
happening
in
the
world
which
seemed
to
be
growing
larger
every
minute
apt
allusions
by
mr
davis
lively
sallies
by
belle
and
quotations
by
russell
from
authors
who
seemed
to
be
household
friends
so
highly
were
they
held
in
reverence
afterwards
there
had
been
music
russell
at
the
piano
and
gwendolyn
and
belle
with
their
violins
and
she
had
sat
upon
the
sofa
by
the
gracious
friend
who
stroked
her
rough
hand
gently
with
her
white
jewelled
fingers
and
talked
to
her
softly
in
the
pauses
of
the
music
of
what
her
mother
was
like
as
a
girl
verily
aunt
rutha
had
a
wonderful
way
of
making
one
feel
at
home
she
laughed
to
herself
as
the
thought
came
to
her
she
felt
more
at
home
than
she
had
ever
done
before
in
her
life
she
remembered
reading
somewhere
that
the
children
of
men
were
often
brought
up
under
alien
conditions
like
ducklings
brooded
over
by
a
mother
hen
but
as
soon
as
a
chance
was
given
they
flew
to
their
native
element
and
the
former
things
were
as
though
they
had
not
been
an
inborn
instinct
of
refinement
made
this
new
life
immediately
congenial
but
could
she
ever
forget
the
weary
conditions
of
sleepy
hollow
she
frequently
heard
in
imagination
the
clatter
of
the
dishes
and
the
rough
romping
of
the
children
as
they
noisily
trooped
to
bed
her
nerves
quivered
as
she
listened
to
mrs
harding
shrilly
droning
the
lullaby
to
the
sleepless
polly
and
lemuel
demanding
to
have
the
giant
told
to
him
six
times
in
succession
it
seemed
to
her
the
life
in
its
bare
drudgery
had
worn
deep
seams
into
her
very
soul
like
country
roads
in
whose
surface
is
torn
apart
in
gaping
wounds
and
unsightly
ruts
by
heavy
wheels
and
frost
and
rain
she
looked
at
her
cousins
with
a
feeling
nearly
akin
to
envy
their
lives
had
no
contrasts
always
this
beautiful
comradeship
with
father
and
mother
and
aunt
rutha
was
so
lovely
she
stopped
abruptly
she
would
not
change
mothers
no
no
she
would
be
loyal
even
in
thought
to
the
pale
tired
woman
whom
she
could
remember
kissing
her
passionately
in
the
twilight
while
bitter
tears
rained
on
her
childish
upturned
face
she
would
not
let
the
demon
of
discontent
spoil
her
visit
she
would
put
by
and
forget
while
she
enjoyed
this
wonderful
slice
of
pleasure
that
had
come
to
her
there
was
just
as
much
greed
in
her
wanting
happiness
wholesale
as
in
lemuel
crying
for
the
whole
loaf
of
gingerbread
the
only
difference
was
in
the
measure
of
their
capacity
is
it
dear
asked
aunt
rutha
with
an
amused
smile
have
been
in
the
brownest
of
studies
she
looked
up
at
her
brightly
believe
it
was
a
briar
tangle
aunt
rutha
of
the
worst
kind
but
i
shall
see
daylight
soon
thank
you
mrs
davis
laid
her
hand
on
her
husband
arm
penknife
robert
our
little
girl
here
is
tied
up
in
a
gordian
knot
and
we
must
help
to
set
her
free
her
uncle
laughed
as
he
opened
the
weapon
good
will
can
take
the
place
of
skill
i
promise
to
cut
no
arteries
then
he
added
more
gravely
you
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
knots
my
dear
of
any
kind
you
belong
to
us
now
they
discussed
her
a
little
in
kindly
fashion
after
she
had
gone
to
her
room
for
the
night
child
has
the
air
of
a
princess
said
mrs
davis
thoughtfully
holds
herself
wonderfully
in
spite
of
her
rustic
training
but
i
suppose
blood
always
tells
and
she
looked
over
at
her
husband
with
a
smile
has
wonderful
powers
of
adaptability
too
said
gwendolyn
watched
her
at
dinner
and
she
never
made
a
single
slip
although
i
imagine
there
were
several
things
that
were
new
to
her
beside
the
she
is
intense
mamma
and
belle
heaved
a
sigh
of
mock
despair
do
believe
she
knows
what
laziness
is
and
i
sure
she
will
end
by
making
me
ashamed
of
myself
when
i
told
her
we
had
a
three
vacation
she
never
said
how
delightful
as
most
girls
would
but
calmly
inquired
what
i
took
up
in
the
holidays
and
when
i
groaned
at
the
very
thought
of
taking
up
anything
she
said
so
seriously
but
you
do
let
your
mind
lie
fallow
for
three
whole
months
and
then
she
sighed
a
little
and
added
half
to
herself
some
girls
would
give
all
the
world
for
such
a
chance
to
read
i
believe
she
is
possessed
with
a
perfect
rage
for
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
and
when
she
goes
to
college
will
pass
poor
me
with
leaps
and
bounds
and
carry
the
hearts
of
all
the
professors
in
her
train
did
you
see
her
said
gwendolyn
i
happened
to
mention
that
our
church
was
always
shut
up
in
the
summer
because
so
many
people
were
out
of
the
city
she
just
turned
those
splendid
eyes
of
hers
on
me
until
i
actually
felt
my
moral
stature
shrivelling
and
asked
what
about
the
people
in
the
city
do
they
have
to
go
on
living
is
plucky
though
said
russell
admiringly
you
notice
when
you
were
both
screaming
because
one
of
our
wheels
caught
in
a
street
car
rail
and
the
carriage
nearly
upset
how
she
never
said
a
word
though
she
must
have
been
frightened
for
we
were
nearly
over
i
like
a
girl
that
has
grit
enough
to
hold
her
tongue
is
a
dear
child
said
mr
davis
she
has
her
mother
eyes
upstairs
in
her
chamber
pauline
spoke
her
verdict
to
herself
are
all
splendid
and
i
a
good
deal
prouder
of
my
relations
than
they
can
be
of
me
i
a
regular
woodpecker
among
birds
of
paradise
i
wish
i
had
to
be
so
dreadfully
plain
well
i
ring
true
if
i
homely
and
character
is
more
than
clothes
anyway
she
undressed
slowly
her
æsthetic
eyes
revelling
in
all
the
dainty
appointments
of
the
room
which
was
to
be
her
very
own
then
she
knelt
by
the
broad
low
and
said
her
prayers
looking
away
to
the
stars
which
glowed
red
and
green
and
yellow
in
the
soft
summer
sky
and
then
in
a
great
hush
of
delight
she
lay
down
between
the
sheets
and
gave
herself
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
present
which
god
had
given
her
she
would
not
think
of
sleepy
hollow
she
had
put
it
by
a
new
world
belle
entered
pauline
room
to
find
her
cousin
revelling
in
the
exquisite
pathos
of
whittier
before
dressing
for
dinner
the
problem
of
clothes
had
been
solved
by
aunt
rutha
in
her
pleasant
tactful
way
are
just
belle
age
my
dear
she
had
said
the
day
after
pauline
arrival
as
she
lifted
a
delicately
pencilled
muslin
from
a
large
parcel
which
had
been
brought
in
from
white
and
laid
it
against
her
fresh
young
cheek
is
very
becoming
do
you
think
so
gwen
it
is
such
a
delight
for
me
to
have
two
daughters
to
shop
for
i
have
always
had
a
craze
to
buy
doubles
of
everything
but
gwendolyn
was
so
much
older
i
could
never
indulge
myself
there
is
no
need
to
say
anything
dearie
and
she
kissed
away
the
remonstrance
that
was
forming
on
pauline
lips
belong
to
us
now
you
know
and
your
uncle
thinks
he
owes
your
mother
more
than
he
can
ever
hope
to
repay
then
she
led
her
to
the
lounge
which
gwendolyn
was
piling
high
with
delicately
embroidered
and
ruffled
underwear
did
not
know
whether
you
would
like
your
sets
to
be
of
different
patterns
or
not
but
belle
has
such
a
horror
of
having
any
two
alike
that
i
ventured
to
think
that
your
tastes
would
agree
the
girls
are
going
in
town
to
order
their
summer
hats
so
you
can
finish
the
rest
of
your
shopping
then
if
you
like
and
get
an
idea
of
our
city
and
then
had
followed
a
morning
such
as
she
had
never
dreamed
of
the
excitement
of
driving
to
the
station
in
the
exhilarating
morning
air
past
houses
which
like
her
uncle
seemed
the
abodes
of
luxurious
ease
before
many
of
them
carriages
were
waiting
and
through
the
open
doors
she
caught
glimpses
of
servants
and
coloured
nurses
carrying
babies
in
long
robes
of
lawn
and
lace
a
vision
of
polly
in
her
pink
checked
gingham
flashed
before
her
how
could
life
be
so
different
the
ride
in
the
cars
was
delightful
past
a
succession
of
elegant
houses
and
beautifully
laid
out
grounds
until
she
began
to
feel
she
had
reached
a
new
world
where
care
was
an
unknown
quantity
then
the
city
with
its
delightful
whirl
of
cars
and
horses
and
people
she
had
never
imagined
there
could
be
so
many
in
any
one
place
before
she
marvelled
at
the
condescension
of
the
gentlemen
in
the
handsomely
appointed
shoe
store
and
blushed
as
one
of
them
placed
her
foot
on
the
rest
she
looked
in
amazement
at
the
elegantly
furnished
apartments
of
madame
louise
and
the
wonderful
structures
of
feathers
and
lace
and
ribbon
which
the
voluble
saleswoman
assured
them
were
cheap
at
thirty
dollars
and
was
lost
in
a
rapturous
delight
as
with
the
calmness
of
experienced
shoppers
her
cousins
went
from
one
department
to
another
in
white
and
hovey
laying
in
a
supply
of
airy
nothings
of
which
she
did
not
even
know
the
use
always
being
treated
by
them
with
the
same
delicate
consideration
there
was
nothing
forced
upon
her
only
as
they
were
getting
things
she
might
as
well
be
fitted
too
then
to
for
ices
and
macaroons
then
up
past
st
paul
and
the
common
and
then
home
to
a
lunch
of
chicken
salad
and
strawberries
and
frothed
chocolate
in
the
cool
with
its
massive
chairs
and
potted
plants
and
roses
she
was
growing
used
now
to
the
new
order
of
things
and
smiled
a
welcome
to
belle
from
the
velvet
lounging
chair
in
which
she
pauline
harding
who
had
never
lounged
in
her
life
was
beginning
to
feel
perfectly
at
home
an
inveterate
bookworm
you
are
paul
and
belle
looked
at
the
pile
of
volumes
pauline
had
brought
from
the
library
to
study
in
the
long
morning
hours
which
the
force
of
a
lifelong
habit
gave
her
before
the
rest
of
the
family
were
astir
forget
i
am
an
ignoramus
she
answered
quietly
must
do
something
to
catch
up
belle
shrugged
her
shoulders
the
use
it
is
surprising
with
what
an
infinitesimal
fraction
of
knowledge
one
can
get
through
this
old
world
a
speech
from
a
woman
in
this
age
is
rank
heresy
of
course
if
you
are
going
in
for
equal
suffrage
and
and
the
rest
but
i
never
aspired
to
the
garment
of
either
lucy
stone
or
frances
willard
i
pine
to
be
an
anatomist
and
professor
herschel
says
i
have
a
decided
talent
for
it
too
however
papa
is
not
progressive
at
least
he
does
not
want
his
daughters
to
be
although
i
tell
him
i
might
be
a
professor
in
harvard
some
day
so
there
is
nothing
left
for
me
but
to
fall
into
the
ranks
of
the
majority
and
do
nothing
so
is
there
nothing
in
the
world
but
suffrage
and
opium
and
anatomy
dear
yes
there
philanthropy
but
gwen
does
that
for
the
family
she
is
on
every
society
under
the
sun
let
me
count
them
if
i
can
there
the
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
children
and
the
society
for
the
improvement
of

the
betterment
of

in

she
is
fairly
torn
asunder
in
her
efforts
to
ameliorate
the
condition
of
the
submerged
tenth
submerged
tenth
echoed
pauline
wonderingly
any
one
submerged
in
boston
dear
stupid
of
course
the
unseen
population
in
filth
rags
and
unrighteousness
and
the
rest
of
us
in
lazy
which
perhaps
in
god
sight
is
about
as
bad
i
often
think
if
each
professing
christian
took
hold
of
one
poor
beggar
and
tried
to
elevate
him
we
should
solve
the
problem
a
great
deal
sooner
than
by
starting
so
many
societies
to
improve
them
in
the
aggregate
i
can
theorize
you
see
but
the
practice
is
beyond
me
why
do
you
try
it
cried
pauline
her
eyes
sparkling
is
a
splendid
idea
you
my
child
because
it
would
involve
work
and
that
is
a
thing
i
abhor
gwendolyn
must
work
on
all
these
societies
said
pauline
belle
danced
across
the
room
and
seated
herself
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
dear
old
thing
you
as
innocent
as
your
own
daisies
and
it
is
a
shame
to
take
you
from
your
mossy
bed
do
you
know
there
is
work
and
work
god
says
go
work
in
my
vineyard
and
we
good
christians
answer
yes
lord
but
let
some
one
else
go
ahead
and
take
out
the
stumps
the
most
of
us
like
to
do
our
spiritual
farming
on
a
western
scale
it
is
pleasanter
to
drive
a
team
of
eight
horses
over
cleared
land
than
to
grub
out
dockweed
and
thistles
all
alone
in
one
corner
she
leaned
forward
and
began
reading
the
titles
of
the
books
pauline
had
selected
for
her
study
and
i
told
mamma
you
were
intense
and
macaulay
of
i
had
no
idea
you
had
monarchical
tendencies
i
must
take
you
to
our
little
chapel
and
show
you
the
communion
service
that
belonged
to
charles
the
second
or
perhaps
it
was
one
of
the
georges
i
not
very
clear
on
that
point
my
dear
paul
you
delicious
to
think
of
anybody
voluntarily
undertaking
to
scrape
acquaintance
with
all
these
worthies
and
in
summertime
is
not
easy
for
you
to
understand
how
hungry
i
am
said
pauline
with
a
tremor
in
her
voice
have
been
going
to
school
all
your
life
yes
sighed
belle
do
pine
for
the
experience
you
will
soon
have
enough
of
it
may
i
inquire
when
you
expect
to
find
time
for
these
exhilarating
researches
pauline
laughed
the
hours
of
five
and
eight
she
faced
round
upon
her
suddenly
wonder
what
you
think
of
us
all
you
are
as
demure
as
a
fieldmouse
but
i
know
those
big
eyes
of
yours
have
taken
our
measures
by
this
time
come
let
us
have
it
the
whole
truth
you
know
do
be
ananias
and
keep
back
part
of
the
price
oh
wad
some
power
the
giftie
gie
us
to
see
oorsels
as
ithers
see
us
i
delight
in
revelations
show
me
myself
paul
pauline
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
she
spoke
out
bravely
love
you
all
dearly
you
have
been
so
kind
but
belle
if
i
had
your
opportunities
i
would
make
more
of
my
life
pauline
birthright
you
believe
in
altitudes
it
was
richard
everidge
aunt
favourite
nephew
who
asked
the
question
of
pauline
as
they
sat
on
the
broad
piazza
after
church
waiting
for
lunch
do
you
mean
mean
that
trilogy
of
exulting
triumph
over
the
trammels
of
circumstance
that
mr
dunn
gave
us
this
morning
do
you
remember
life
is
what
we
make
it
an
anthem
or
a
dirge
a
psalm
of
hope
or
a
lamentation
of
despair
do
you
believe
any
one
can
live
in
such
a
rare
atmosphere
every
day
course
she
does
and
belle
laughed
merrily
who
has
courage
to
stroll
through
the
middle
ages
with
old
mr
hallam
before
sunrise
must
have
plenty
of
altitude
in
her
composition
it
is
my
belief
she
lives
on
mount
shasta
in
a
moral
sense
and
i
should
be
surprised
to
hear
of
her
taking
out
a
building
permit
at
the
north
pole
if
she
thought
duty
called
her
but
dick
how
can
you
be
such
an
atrocious
sceptic
as
to
doubt
the
possibility
of
one
living
above
the
clouds
when
you
know
my
lady
but
she
is
tryphosa
the
blessed
echoed
pauline
in
a
mystified
tone
is
her
name
said
richard
everidge
with
a
tender
reverence
in
his
voice
she
deserves
it
for
she
is
among
the
aristocracy
of
the
elect
i
never
see
her
without
feeling
envious
and
yet
she
has
been
a
sufferer
for
years
i
am
amazed
that
belle
has
let
all
this
time
pass
without
taking
you
to
call
at
the
threshold
of
the
palace
beautiful
have
been
so
many
other
things
said
belle
you
know
and
canoe
practice
and
tandem
parties
her
cousin
laughed
that
is
only
when
russ
and
i
are
not
reading
up
for
exams
what
do
you
find
to
occupy
your
leisure
exclaimed
belle
solemnly
my
dear
boy
has
been
an
unknown
quantity
ever
since
i
undertook
to
pilot
this
most
inexorable
young
woman
among
the
antiquities
of
our
venerable
city
she
is
an
inveterate
is
enraptured
with
bunker
hill
and
the
old
south
delights
in
cornhill
and
wherever
she
can
find
a
crooked
old
street
that
reminds
her
of
washington
and
pokes
about
all
the
old
cemeteries
until
i
feel
as
eerie
as
coleridge
ancient
mariner
i
believe
she
expects
to
come
upon
all
the
pilgrim
fathers
buried
in
one
vault
but
there
is
nothing
special
on
the
programme
for
we
will
go
and
see
my
lady
this
very
afternoon
as
they
went
in
to
lunch
richard
everidge
leaned
over
to
pauline
and
whispered
have
not
answered
my
question
do
you
think
it
is
possible
for
common
christians
to
live
above
the
clouds
i
were
a
christian
she
said
in
a
low
tone
should
want
to
get
as
high
up
as
i
could
when
they
reached
tryphosa
they
heard
her
singing
they
waited
listening
brief
is
the
sighing
and
brief
is
the
crying
for
brief
is
the
life
the
life
there
is
endless
the
joy
there
is
endless
and
ended
the
strife
o
country
the
fairest
our
country
the
dearest
we
press
toward
thee
o
sion
the
golden
our
eyes
are
still
holden
thy
light
till
we
see
we
know
not
we
know
not
all
human
words
show
not
the
joys
we
may
reach
the
mansions
preparing
the
joys
for
our
sharing
the
welcome
for
each
then
belle
opened
the
door
softly
and
went
in
pauline
saw
a
large
bay
window
opening
into
a
tiny
conservatory
which
loving
hands
kept
dowered
with
a
profusion
of
blooming
plants
the
room
was
large
and
dainty
with
delicate
draperies
two
or
three
fine
pictures
and
a
beautiful
representation
in
marble
of
the
angel
of
patience
which
stood
on
a
buhl
table
where
the
invalid
eyes
could
always
rest
upon
it
tryphosa
turned
her
head
to
greet
them
from
the
low
couch
which
was
the
where
she
had
wrestled
with
the
angel
of
pain
during
years
of
physical
agony
her
eyes
were
lustrous
with
a
radiance
not
of
earth
and
a
wealth
of
silver
hair
fell
in
soft
curling
waves
about
her
face
her
mouth
sweet
and
tender
parted
in
a
smile
of
welcome
as
she
held
out
her
hands
to
the
girls
belle
caught
them
in
her
own
and
kissed
them
gently
is
our
cousin
my
lady
aunt
mildred
only
child
the
thin
hands
drew
pauline
face
down
and
she
was
kissed
on
cheek
and
brow
mother
was
my
friend
dear
child
in
the
long
ago
then
she
added
softly
with
her
hands
on
the
silver
cross
at
her
throat
you
a
princess
do
you
belong
to
the
king
pauline
shook
her
head
my
lady
am
very
sorry
they
sat
down
then
beside
her
she
held
pauline
strong
hand
between
her
wasted
fingers
mildred
davis
you
have
her
eyes
and
brow
my
child
it
does
me
good
to
see
you
is
just
like
papa
said
belle
says
he
can
almost
fancy
himself
back
in
the
old
home
with
aunt
mildred
getting
him
ready
for
school
pauline
coloured
with
pleasure
no
one
spoke
of
her
mother
at
sleepy
hollow
she
looked
through
the
french
windows
into
the
conservatory
beautiful
the
flowers
are
love
them
of
course
you
must
to
be
your
mother
child
it
is
such
a
comfort
to
me
to
lie
here
and
listen
to
them
talk
exclaimed
pauline
they
do
that
my
lady
tryphosa
smiled
she
said
gently
every
flower
has
its
story
and
every
butterfly
life
is
a
poem
belle
broke
the
silence
heard
you
singing
my
lady
i
do
not
think
pauline
had
thought
you
would
have
the
heart
to
sing
a
ripple
of
the
sweetest
laughter
pauline
had
ever
heard
fell
through
the
quiet
room
and
tryphosa
eyes
flashed
merrily
the
pilgrims
kept
on
their
journey
and
as
they
journeyed
they
sang
she
said
you
think
there
is
anything
to
cry
about
when
we
are
on
our
way
to
a
palace
dear
child
but
sunday
is
always
my
resting
time
she
continued
do
not
sing
as
much
through
the
week
as
i
should
i
am
tired
often
and
busy
echoed
pauline
involuntarily
with
a
glance
at
the
frail
body
propped
up
among
the
cushions
tryphosa
gave
another
soft
merry
laugh
and
drew
forward
a
rosewood
which
was
fitted
to
her
couch
is
where
i
do
my
work
when
my
hands
are
willing
and
then
there
are
my
dear
poor
people
and
my
rich
friends
and
sometimes
the
latter
need
as
much
comforting
as
the
former
oh
there
is
a
great
deal
to
do
dear
child
for
some
have
to
be
taught
the
way
to
the
palace
and
some
have
to
be
brought
into
audience
with
the
king
her
voice
hushed
itself
into
a
reverent
whisper
how
about
the
pain
my
lady
asked
belle
pauline
eyes
were
full
of
tears
right
she
answered
brightly
days
are
set
in
minor
key
and
the
lord
calls
me
where
the
waves
run
high
but
so
long
as
i
am
sure
it
is
the
lord
what
does
it
matter
not
one
good
thing
has
failed
of
all
that
he
has
promised
and
soldiers
do
not
mind
a
few
sword
thrusts
when
they
are
marching
to
victory
this
day
the
noise
of
battle
the
next
the
victor
song
she
closed
her
eyes
and
a
triumphant
smile
played
about
her
mouth
seem
so
certain
my
lady
said
belle
wistfully
for
we
know
that
he
hath
prepared
for
us
a
city
you
mean
heaven
said
pauline
impetuously
me
heaven
is
enveloped
in
fog
will
not
be
dear
child
when
the
mists
have
rolled
away
and
in
the
clear
light
of
the
sun
of
righteousness
you
look
across
to
the
other
shore
you
tell
me
what
it
is
like
my
lady
you
seem
to
know
i
ca
fathom
it
and
everything
looks
so
dark
tryphosa
lifted
a
plain
little
book
from
a
revolving
bookcase
of
treasures
which
stood
within
easy
reach
believe
i
will
let
miss
warner
answer
you
would
you
like
a
heaven
so
small
so
human
that
mortal
words
could
line
it
out
and
mortal
wishes
be
its
boundary
the
things
we
look
for
are
prepared
by
one
whose
thoughts
are
as
far
above
our
thoughts
as
the
broad
starlit
heaven
is
above
this
little
gaslit
earth
and
do
you
think
that
people
are
to
be
all
massed
in
heaven
losing
their
various
identities
their
differing
tastes
their
separate
natures
going
from
this
lower
world
so
full
of
its
adaptations
where
colour
and
form
take
on
a
thousand
changes
and
life
and
pursuit
can
be
varied
almost
at
will
to
a
mere
dead
level
of
perfect
felicity
to
leave
earth
where
no
two
things
are
alike
and
go
to
heaven
to
find
no
two
different
the
lord
preparations
mean
more
than
that
we
should
learn
better
from
this
lower
world
no
one
pair
of
black
eyes
is
just
like
another
no
two
leaves
upon
the
same
tree
and
not
a
yellow
blossom
can
spring
up
by
the
wayside
without
a
red
or
a
white
one
at
hand
for
contrast
are
the
clouds
copies
of
each
other
are
the
shadows
on
the
hills
ever
twice
the
same
take
for
your
comfort
the
full
assurance
that
the
very
tree
of
life
which
in
eden
seems
to
have
borne
but
one
manner
of
fruit
in
heaven
shall
bear
twelve
but
we
can
not
imagine
it
in
its
fulness
we
must
look
not
to
see
clear
outlines
and
distinct
colours
but
only
the
flood
of
heavenly
light
from
point
to
point
the
promises
pass
on
with
their
golden
touch
until
the
vacant
places
in
our
lives
disappear
and
the
aches
die
out
and
desire
and
longing
are
lost
in
than
heart
could
wish
a
pause
fell
then
and
a
stillness
broken
only
by
the
plashing
of
a
little
fountain
whose
drops
fell
among
the
flowers
as
they
rose
to
go
tryphosa
drew
pauline
face
down
until
it
touched
her
own
child
wo
you
claim
your
birthright
will
my
lady
giving
oneself
the
summer
slipped
away
and
to
pauline
it
was
a
continual
dream
of
pleasure
she
adhered
strictly
to
her
habit
of
rising
with
the
sun
and
not
the
least
enjoyable
part
of
the
morning
was
the
three
hours
spent
in
the
solitude
of
her
uncle
luxurious
library
while
the
day
was
new
her
active
mind
awoke
from
its
enforced
lethargy
and
plumed
itself
for
flight
with
a
delightful
sense
of
freedom
the
dream
of
her
life
was
coming
true
at
last
and
she
was
to
have
a
chance
to
learn
she
had
learned
all
that
the
sleepy
hollow
school
could
teach
her
long
ago
she
would
take
up
chemistry
of
course
and
biology
mathematics
and
physics
french
and
latin
geology
and
botany
and
well
she
would
decide
later
upon
the
rest
of
her
curriculum
her
father
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
she
should
stay
in
boston
her
uncle
called
her
his
own
little
daughter
and
she
was
content
her
healthy
nature
enjoyed
to
the
full
the
innumerable
diversions
and
pleasures
which
belle
active
brain
was
continually
planning
picnics
and
excursions
to
the
beaches
where
she
was
never
tired
of
feasting
her
eyes
on
the
glory
of
the
waves
or
a
run
into
the
city
to
hear
some
special
attraction
always
brightness
and
fun
and
laughter
for
aunt
rutha
hospitable
house
was
a
favourite
resort
with
many
of
the
harvard
students
and
it
was
the
glorious
summer
time
when
all
the
world
their
little
world
was
free
to
be
gay
she
pauline
harding
was
like
other
girls
at
last
then
she
must
learn
to
row
and
to
ride
with
richard
everidge
for
her
teacher
belle
taught
her
to
swim
and
russell
to
play
tennis
and
gwendolyn
took
her
to
some
of
the
many
meetings
to
which
she
devoted
her
life
and
then
there
was
tryphosa
she
always
made
time
for
a
visit
there
at
least
once
every
week
she
was
hungry
to
hear
all
she
could
about
her
mother
she
began
to
understand
how
richard
everidge
in
the
pride
of
his
manly
beauty
could
find
it
in
his
heart
to
envy
the
woman
who
day
and
night
kept
close
company
with
pain
sometimes
the
shadows
would
lie
purple
under
the
brilliant
eyes
and
the
thin
fingers
be
tightly
clenched
in
anguish
but
the
brave
lips
gave
no
sign
on
such
days
pauline
could
only
sit
beside
her
in
mute
sorrow
or
sing
softly
some
of
the
hymns
she
loved
is
terrible
to
see
you
suffer
so
my
lady
she
cried
one
morning
when
in
the
fulness
of
her
strength
she
had
gone
from
the
laughing
sunshine
into
the
shadowed
room
where
every
ray
of
light
fell
like
a
blow
upon
the
invalid
quivering
nerves
tryphosa
made
answer
with
a
smile
one
stroke
too
much
dear
child
it
is
my
father
hand
upon
the
he
never
makes
mistakes
one
day
she
slipped
away
directly
after
breakfast
she
wanted
to
be
sure
of
finding
her
alone
it
was
one
of
the
invalid
good
days
and
she
greeted
her
with
a
bright
smile
of
welcome
lady
she
began
abruptly
you
think
i
have
forgotten
all
about
my
promise
i
could
not
it
has
haunted
me
through
everything
and
i
gave
myself
to
the
king
last
night
tryphosa
eyes
glowed
deep
with
pleasure
god
she
exclaimed
softly
then
she
closed
her
eyes
and
pauline
knew
from
her
moving
lips
that
she
was
talking
with
the
lord
she
touched
pauline
gently
had
to
talk
a
little
about
the
good
news
with
jesus
he
is
my
nearest
neighbour
you
know
and
now
dear
child
tell
me
all
about
it
what
a
wonderfully
simple
thing
it
is
people
talk
so
much
about
being
a
christian
when
after
all
it
is
simply
to
be
christ
we
open
the
door
where
he
has
knocked
so
long
and
let
him
in
we
give
ourselves
away
to
jesus
henceforth
to
live
in
him
with
him
by
him
and
for
him
for
ever
dear
child
when
you
were
giving
did
you
include
your
will
will
echoed
pauline
startled
surely
the
christian
is
not
to
direct
his
master
how
do
you
mean
my
lady
tryphosa
began
to
sing
softly
little
bird
lie
still
in
thy
low
nest
thy
part
to
love
my
will
my
part
the
rest
is
his
message
to
me
yours
will
be
different
for
no
two
of
his
children
get
the
same
training
suppose
now
life
will
be
all
duty
said
pauline
with
a
sigh
tryphosa
smiled
is
not
the
way
i
read
my
bible
peter
says
we
must
love
the
brethren
and
john
this
is
christ
commandment
that
we
believe
and
love
because
he
who
loveth
knoweth
god
and
paul
the
love
of
christ
constraineth
us
but
i
must
do
something
my
lady
fall
into
that
snare
little
one
it
is
what
we
are
not
what
we
do
the
dear
christ
wants
us
not
for
what
we
do
for
him
but
what
he
does
for
us
listen
he
that
abideth
in
me
and
i
in
him
the
same
bringeth
forth
much
fruit
for
without
me
ye
can
do
nothing
he
that
dwelleth
in
the
secret
place
of
the
most
high
shall
abide
under
the
shadow
of
the
almighty
the
first
great
thing
for
you
now
is
to
get
your
meaning
pauline
looked
puzzled
do
not
understand
my
lady
are
you
going
to
stand
for
how
much
better
is
the
world
to
be
for
your
having
lived
in
it
the
day
is
long
past
when
people
were
satisfied
with
a
sunday
religion
true
christianity
means
a
daily
consecration
of
purpose
look
at
the
men
who
have
made
their
mark
in
the
world
reformers
inventors
discoverers
all
men
of
a
single
purpose
and
paul
says
this
one
thing
i
do
michael
angelo
said
nothing
makes
the
soul
so
pure
so
religious
as
the
endeavour
to
create
something
perfect
for
god
is
perfection
and
whoever
strives
for
it
strives
for
something
that
is
and
remember
perfect
has
no
clipped
edges
no
dreary
blanks
little
one
i
want
you
to
strive
to
be
a
perfect
christian
pauline
fell
on
her
knees
beside
the
couch
and
buried
her
face
in
the
cushions
am
not
worthy
she
murmured
tryphosa
laid
her
hand
very
tenderly
upon
the
bowed
head
as
she
repeated
in
low
triumphant
tones
i
will
greatly
rejoice
in
the
lord
my
soul
shall
be
joyful
in
my
god
for
he
hath
clothed
me
with
the
garments
of
salvation
he
hath
covered
me
with
the
robe
of
righteousness
as
a
bridegroom
decketh
himself
with
ornaments
and
as
a
bride
adorneth
herself
with
her
jewels
this
is
the
will
of
god
even
your
sanctification
that
ye
may
be
holy
and
without
blame
before
him
in
love
be
ye
perfect
as
my
father
in
heaven
is
perfect
according
to
the
measure
of
our
capacity
that
is
the
idea
just
as
the
tiny
cup
may
be
as
full
as
the
ocean
but
for
this
we
must
lay
all
upon
the
altar
there
must
be
no
closed
doors
no
reserved
corners
in
our
hearts
we
must
give
christ
the
key
to
every
room
so
that
he
shall
be
not
merely
a
guest
in
the
but
the
owner
of
the
house
are
you
ready
for
that
dear
child
and
pauline
answered
humbly
want
the
very
best
god
has
to
give
me
a
great
surrender
the
beautiful
summer
had
slipped
away
and
the
glory
of
october
was
over
the
land
pauline
had
crossed
the
borders
and
plunged
with
all
the
zest
of
her
thirsty
soul
into
the
fair
world
of
knowledge
which
lay
stretched
at
her
feet
her
three
months
of
conscientious
study
had
been
of
great
service
as
a
preparatory
training
and
already
more
than
one
of
the
professors
had
complimented
her
on
her
breadth
of
view
and
the
rapidity
with
which
she
was
able
to
grasp
an
idea
a
subtle
sense
of
power
stole
over
her
every
part
of
her
being
seemed
to
expand
in
the
congenial
atmosphere
a
brilliant
future
seemed
opening
before
her
enraptured
gaze
the
world
should
be
the
better
for
her
life
god
had
endowed
her
with
gifts
she
would
lay
them
at
his
feet
she
would
devote
herself
to
the
of
others
she
would
strive
to
lift
them
from
the
torpor
of
their
into
a
higher
life
life
was
magnificent
poor
tryphosa
in
her
narrow
sphere
of
pain
how
could
she
be
so
happy
belle
hurried
along
the
hall
and
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
chamber
dear
paul
do
you
know
we
are
all
waiting
what
have
you
been
doing
if
i
could
only
get
a
snapshot
at
you
now
i
should
call
it
the
intoxication
of
success
you
would
make
a
splendid
jeanne
with
the
light
of
high
and
holy
purpose
in
her
eyes
but
as
this
is
the
last
saturday
in
the
year
that
we
shall
have
the
chance
of
a
ride
to
forest
glen
and
home
by
moonlight
i
move
that
we
postpone
our
rhapsodies
until
a
more
convenient
season
the
boys
are
waiting
below
with
the
horses
and
the
servants
started
long
ago
with
the
hampers
even
gwen
has
been
wooed
by
the
beauty
of
the
morning
to
accompany
us
though
i
think
there
are
about
a
dozen
meetings
on
her
calendar
here
is
a
letter
for
you
but
you
have
no
time
to
read
it
now
i
kept
you
oh
i
am
sorry
and
catching
up
her
riding
whip
pauline
threw
her
habit
over
her
arm
and
ran
down
to
where
richard
everidge
held
the
handsome
bay
mare
which
had
been
her
gift
the
letter
she
had
tossed
lightly
on
the
table
it
was
from
her
father
but
it
would
keep
there
was
never
any
news
at
sleepy
hollow
aunt
rutha
watched
the
merry
party
as
they
cantered
off
well
pauline
looks
in
the
saddle
we
have
been
very
fortunate
in
our
adopted
daughter
robert
she
is
a
sweet
girl
and
her
passion
for
knowledge
is
just
the
incentive
that
our
lazy
little
belle
needs
i
only
hope
her
father
will
never
take
it
into
his
head
to
claim
her
again
she
is
a
blessing
in
the
house
on
and
on
the
riders
travelled
through
the
exhilarating
autumn
air
until
they
stopped
for
lunch
on
the
borders
of
a
forest
which
jack
frost
had
set
ablaze
and
which
glowed
in
the
sunshine
with
a
dazzling
splendour
of
crimson
and
bronze
and
gold
the
hours
flew
by
and
when
they
started
homewards
the
sun
was
sinking
in
majestic
glory
while
on
the
opposite
horizon
the
moon
rose
silver
clear
pauline
every
nerve
quivered
with
delight
it
was
a
perfect
ending
to
a
perfect
day
when
she
went
up
to
her
room
that
night
her
eye
fell
on
the
forgotten
letter
she
opened
it
slowly
with
a
smile
on
her
lips
suddenly
the
smile
faded
and
a
cold
chill
crept
into
her
heart
has
been
such
a
happy
day
she
had
told
aunt
rutha
as
after
the
merry
supper
was
over
she
had
stood
by
her
side
in
the
library
a
happy
day
without
a
flaw
and
now
already
it
seemed
to
be
fading
into
the
dim
dim
past
and
yet
it
was
only
a
few
hours
since
richard
everidge
had
climbed
lightly
up
after
the
spray
of
brilliant
leaves
which
she
had
admired
and
she
had
pinned
them
against
the
dark
background
of
her
riding
habit
even
now
they
were
before
her
on
the
table
she
looked
at
them
with
a
dull
sense
of
pain
has
had
a
stroke
of
some
sort
mr
harding
wrote
doctor
does
seem
to
know
rightly
what
she
is
somewhat
better
but
she
leave
her
bed
the
children
are
well
except
polly
who
seems
weakly
the
doctor
thinks
her
spine
has
been
hurt
mother
had
her
in
her
arms
when
she
fell
pauline
shivered
was
this
god
for
her
the
letter
dropped
from
her
hand
and
she
sat
for
hours
motionless
her
eyes
taking
in
every
detail
of
the
pretty
moonlit
room
until
it
was
indelibly
engraved
upon
her
memory
when
the
morning
came
she
took
the
letter
to
tryphosa
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
tell
the
others
yet
the
eyes
that
looked
up
at
her
from
the
open
sheet
were
very
tender
child
are
you
satisfied
what
my
lady
christ
and
the
life
he
has
planned
for
you
she
hesitated
if
it
had
been
this
other
life
that
she
had
been
planning
for
herself
only
the
day
before
how
gladly
she
would
have
answered
but
if
it
should
be
sleepy
hollow
could
she
say
yes
with
her
keen
intuition
which
had
been
sharpened
by
pain
tryphosa
divined
her
thought
am
going
to
give
you
a
new
beatitude
she
said
brightly
be
drudgery
for
it
is
the
grey
angel
of
success
is
a
hard
gospel
my
lady
but
ease
and
victory
are
for
ever
incompatible
the
father
loved
the
son
yet
he
surrendered
him
to
a
life
of
toil
and
christ
himself
gave
his
chosen
ones
the
heritage
of
tribulation
crowned
with
the
sweet
bright
gift
of
peace
it
is
the
tried
lives
that
ring
the
truest
the
idea
runs
all
through
the
bible
silver
purified
seven
times
and
gold
tried
in
the
fire
and
polished
after
the
similitude
of
a
palace
have
you
ever
thought
of
the
friction
that
involves
the
finest
diamonds
bear
the
most
cutting
and
it
is
the
mission
of
the
diamond
to
reflect
the
light
if
we
would
have
our
lives
a
success
we
must
seek
not
happiness
but
harmony
with
what
my
lady
will
of
god
dear
child
we
are
out
of
tune
when
god
finds
us
he
puts
us
in
tune
with
our
great
keynote
jesus
and
then
we
are
like
an
æolian
harp
the
west
and
the
east
winds
make
music
through
it
and
the
shrieking
storm
the
sweetest
music
of
all
but
remember
little
one
it
is
the
joy
of
the
lord
which
is
our
strength
we
must
sit
in
the
sunshine
if
we
would
reflect
the
rainbow
that
night
pauline
spent
upon
her
knees
is
ridiculous
exclaimed
mr
davis
when
the
next
morning
she
announced
her
decision
to
the
family
will
send
a
nurse
down
by
the
early
train
but
it
is
not
fit
work
for
you
my
child
and
besides
we
can
not
spare
you
her
eyes
filled
is
so
good
of
you
to
say
that
but
my
father
has
called
me
and
i
must
go
does
not
say
anything
about
your
going
in
the
letter
said
mr
davis
as
he
ran
his
eyes
over
the
words
mean
my
heavenly
father
uncle
robert
she
said
simply
message
came
last
night
after
that
they
could
not
shake
her
although
belle
hung
about
her
tearfully
russell
and
gwen
protested
aunt
rutha
looked
at
her
with
sorrowful
eyes
and
mr
davis
repeated
that
the
very
idea
was
absurd
as
he
paced
up
and
down
with
a
strange
huskiness
in
his
throat
have
come
to
say
my
lady
tryphosa
looked
wistfully
at
the
brave
sweet
face
which
she
knew
she
would
see
no
more
soon
dear
child
have
given
christ
the
key
as
you
said
and
now
i
am
under
orders
i
knew
it
would
come
it
is
only
that
we
must
travel
by
different
roads
we
shall
meet
at
the
end
of
the
journey
you
never
told
me
that
my
way
to
the
kingdom
lay
through
sleepy
hollow
not
dear
child
it
is
not
for
me
to
do
the
work
of
the
holy
spirit
i
knew
you
would
hear
his
voice
speaking
to
you
from
out
the
shadows
pauline
sighed
have
so
longed
for
culture
my
lady
and
now
i
must
put
it
by
am
going
to
quote
again
blessed
be
drudgery
the
secret
of
all
culture
some
one
has
said
latin
and
greek
and
music
and
art
and
travel
are
the
decorations
of
life
but
industry
and
perseverance
courage
before
difficulties
and
cheer
under
straining
burdens
and
are
the
indispensables
it
is
our
daily
task
that
mainly
educates
us
and
the
humblest
woman
may
live
splendidly
and
remember
dear
child
a
life
like
christ
is
the
grandest
thing
in
the
world
angels
may
well
envy
us
the
opportunity
of
living
it
for
god
himself
has
lived
it
in
christ
and
rejoices
to
live
it
again
in
each
of
us
we
should
glory
in
the
thought
that
our
king
allows
us
to
be
the
mirror
in
which
the
world
may
see
jesus
may
the
lord
keep
you
as
one
of
his
hidden
ones
my
darling
and
make
you
to
realise
that
he
who
holdeth
the
height
of
the
hills
spreads
the
hush
of
his
presence
over
the
valleys
then
she
drew
her
close
in
a
long
last
farewell
idealising
the
real
you
can
not
realise
your
ideal
you
can
at
least
idealise
your
real
as
the
train
slackened
speed
pauline
lifted
her
eyes
from
the
book
which
richard
everidge
had
laid
on
the
seat
beside
her
after
giving
her
that
last
strong
handshake
to
see
her
father
standing
in
front
of
the
sleepy
hollow
station
a
great
pity
filled
her
heart
how
worn
and
old
he
looked
they
had
all
wanted
to
accompany
her
part
of
the
way
and
belle
had
pleaded
to
be
allowed
to
go
and
help
nurse
but
she
had
said
them
nay
she
knew
the
accommodations
of
hickory
farm
and
it
was
easier
to
leave
them
where
she
had
met
them
first
at
the
entrance
of
what
would
always
be
to
her
the
city
of
delights
abraham
lincoln
and
the
spring
waggon
had
the
whole
beautiful
summer
been
one
delicious
dream
could
it
be
only
a
week
since
she
had
stood
entranced
in
that
forest
of
flame
here
the
leaves
hung
brown
and
shrivelled
on
the
denuded
branches
stray
flakes
of
snow
were
in
the
air
and
the
early
twilight
fell
chill
and
dreary
terrible
glad
to
see
you
pauline
though
i
hated
to
spoil
your
visit
said
mr
harding
as
he
gave
abraham
lincoln
a
taste
of
the
whip
pauline
leaned
towards
him
and
laid
both
hands
upon
his
arm
father
i
am
so
sorry
for
you
now
tell
me
all
about
it
and
the
tired
man
turned
to
the
daughter
who
for
his
sake
had
left
ease
and
beauty
and
friends
and
shifted
to
her
shoulders
the
burden
which
he
found
too
heavy
for
his
own
the
children
crowded
to
meet
her
as
she
stumbled
through
the
narrow
into
the
kitchen
how
dark
it
was
her
quick
glance
comprehended
the
whole
scene
and
the
contrast
between
it
and
that
other
smote
her
with
a
keen
sense
of
physical
pain
she
looked
at
the
solitary
lamp
with
its
grotesquely
hideous
ornament
of
red
flannel
at
susan
expressionless
freckled
face
at
the
boys
in
their
boots
and
overalls
at
the
but
hopelessly
martha
spriggs
with
her
thin
hair
drawn
tight
into
a
knob
the
size
of
a
bullet
and
her
bare
arms
akimbo
her
real
would
it
be
possible
to
idealize
anything
at
sleepy
hollow
she
got
her
welcome
in
various
fashions
about
time
you
were
getting
back
exclaimed
mrs
harding
from
the
bed
on
which
she
was
forced
to
lie
in
bitterness
of
spirit
with
polly
by
her
side
suppose
nothing
less
than
a
stroke
would
have
brought
you
it
beats
me
how
people
can
be
such
sponges
i
thankful
i
was
never
one
to
go
trailin
about
the
country
after
my
relations
i
never
was
away
from
home
more
than
a
day
in
my
life
till
i
was
married
and
it
been
nothing
but
work
ever
since
and
now
to
be
laid
here
like
a
useless
log
with
everything
going
hotfoot
to
destruction
it
a
good
thing
you
come
at
last
for
the
children
are
makin
sawdust
and
splinters
of
every
bit
of
crockery
in
the
house
and
that
martha
spriggs
has
no
more
management
than
a
settin
hen
i
do
suppose
you
be
much
better
though
you
never
did
hev
much
of
a
head
an
now
been
up
among
the
clouds
so
long
you
be
more
like
to
sugar
the
butter
and
salt
the
pies
than
before
pauline
lifted
polly
from
her
uncomfortable
position
with
a
warm
glow
about
her
heart
which
all
the
sick
woman
bitterness
was
powerless
to
quench
if
she
could
see
richard
everidge
she
would
tell
him
that
she
did
believe
in
altitudes
now
it
was
possible
even
in
the
valleys
to
live
above
the
clouds
not
seek
happiness
tryphosa
had
said
harmony
with
god
will
and
god
will
for
her
was
sleepy
hollow
is
not
what
we
do
but
what
we
are
dear
child
she
seemed
to
hear
her
saying
she
remembered
reading
that
smallest
roadside
pool
has
its
water
from
heaven
and
its
gleam
from
the
sun
and
can
hold
the
stars
in
its
bosom
as
well
as
the
great
ocean
god
could
make
a
christian
even
in
sleepy
hollow
powerful

his
lower
lip
protruded
ominously
had
nuthin
martha
spriggs

any
she
only

the
cow
that
jumped
over
the
moon
an
that
no
good
true
nuther
fer
our
cows
do
do
it
no
time
the
next
morning
for
the
long
hours
of
delightful
study
it
was
churning
day
and
there
was
baking
to
be
done
and
the
mending
was
behindhand
and
the
children
needed
clothes
besides
the
numerous
jobs
which
mrs
harding
had
deferred
but
which
she
was
prompt
to
require
done
as
soon
as
she
had
some
one
besides
martha
to
call
on
then
her
meals
must
be
given
to
her
and
nothing
tasted
right
and
the
children
were
so
noisy
and
the
older
boys
so
uncouth
wearily
pauline
toiled
up
the
narrow
stairs
with
polly
as
the
clock
struck
nine
she
laid
the
sleeping
child
on
her
bed
softly
so
as
not
to
wake
lemuel
and
knelt
down
by
the
window
not
a
sound
broke
the
stillness
her
thoughts
flew
to
the
chamber
and
the
soft
lighted
library
where
she
could
almost
see
uncle
robert
and
aunt
rutha
and
belle
and
richard
and
russell
and
gwen
but
they
might
not
be
there
yet
they
had
set
apart
this
night
she
remembered
to
run
over
for
a
look
through
the
big
telescope
last
week
that
was
before
she
had
decided
to
come
to
sleepy
hollow
and
broken
up
all
their
happy
plans
only
last
week
then
she
thought
of
tryphosa
lying
with
closed
eyes
in
her
darkened
room
waiting
patiently
for
the
sleep
which
so
often
refused
to
come
while
the
angel
of
pain
brooded
over
her
pillow
then
her
eyes
sought
the
stars
dear
things
she
whispered
put
you
in
your
places
and
told
you
to
shine
and
for
all
these
hundreds
of
years
you
just
kept
on
shining
oh
my
lady
ask
god
to
help
me
to
make
this
dark
place
bright
she
knelt
on
in
the
clear
cold
moonlight
until
at
last
the
hush
of
god
peace
crept
into
her
heart
and
there
was
a
great
calm
the
winter
crept
on
steadily
jack
frost
threw
photographs
of
fairyland
upon
the
windows
and
hung
the
roofs
with
fringes
of
crystal
pendants
while
the
snowflakes
piled
themselves
over
the
fences
and
made
a
shroud
for
the
trees
and
every
day
pauline
with
this
strange
peace
in
her
heart
did
her
housework
to
the
glory
of
god
there
were
bright
spots
here
and
there
for
the
boston
letters
came
freely
and
the
magazines
which
she
had
liked
best
and
now
and
then
a
book
as
belle
said
keep
mr
hallam
company
they
would
not
let
her
drop
out
of
their
life
these
kind
friends
and
she
took
it
all
thankfully
though
she
could
only
glance
at
the
magazines
and
never
opened
the
books
there
would
be
time
she
said
to
herself
cheerfully
there
was
so
much
waiting
for
her
in
the
beautiful
beats
me
said
mrs
harding
fretfully
as
pauline
hushed
polly
to
sleep
you
do
to
that
child
i
used
to
sing
to
her
till
my
throat
cracked
but
you
just
smooth
her
hair
awhile
with
those
fingers
of
yours
and
off
she
goes
i
wish
you
come
and
smooth
me
off
to
sleep
i
that
tired
lying
here
i
do
know
what
to
do
that
new
doctor
no
more
good
than
his
powders
are
i
do
see
what
old
dr
ross
had
to
die
for
just
before
i
was
goin
ter
need
him
and
the
sick
woman
groaned
pauline
laid
polly
in
her
cot
with
a
smile
this
grudging
praise
was
very
sweet
to
her
to
make
darkness
light
that
was
christ
mission
and
hers
she
was
putting
her
whole
soul
in
the
effort
makes
so
different
queried
leander
of
stephen
and
john
as
they
rested
from
their
daily
task
of
cutting
wood
used
ter
be
as
mad
as
hops
if
yer
mussed
up
yer
clothes
an
now
she
only
laughs
sez
never
mind
if
it
a
stain
that
soap
will
conquer
she
always
singin
too
said
john
thoughtfully
mother
did
scold
so
it
would
be
real
pleasant
like
to
know
why
it
is
though
repeated
leander
thoughtfully
she
belongs
to
the
king
said
the
clear
sweet
voice
of
his
from
the
doorway
she
wants
you
all
to
belong
to
him
too
when
she
went
back
into
the
house
she
found
lemuel
brandishing
a
broomstick
over
the
frightened
polly
lemuel
what
are
you
doing
casted
the
devils
out
of
her
exclaimed
that
youth
triumphantly
they
gone
inter
the
pig
pen
whole
leguns
of
an
kickin
orful
a
lost
letter
seven
years
had
gone
by
and
every
day
of
each
successive
month
had
been
full
to
overflowing
of
hard
work
for
pauline
tryphosa
she
whispered
to
herself
with
a
smile
little
thought
when
you
gave
me
that
new
beatitude
what
constant
friends
the
grey
angel
of
drudgery
and
i
were
to
be
she
climbed
slowly
up
the
narrow
stairs
to
her
room
and
shaded
the
lamp
that
it
might
not
disturb
polly
troubled
sleep
poor
polly
who
would
be
an
invalid
for
life
then
she
sat
down
with
a
sigh
of
relief
to
read
belle
last
letter
it
had
been
a
hard
day
her
had
been
more
than
usually
restless
and
the
had
been
very
heavy
for
martha
spriggs
was
home
on
a
visit
every
nerve
in
her
body
seemed
to
quiver
with
the
strain
dearest
paul
belle
wrote
can
hardly
see
for
crying
but
i
promised
her
that
you
should
know
at
once
went
away
from
us
to
the
other
shore
last
night
we
were
all
there
her
inner
circle
as
she
used
to
call
us
all
except
you
and
she
seemed
to
miss
you
so
i
never
knew
her
to
grow
fond
of
any
one
in
so
short
a
time
but
she
took
you
right
into
her
heart
from
the
first
if
i
had
not
loved
you
so
much
i
should
have
been
jealous
but
who
could
be
jealous
of
you
you
precious
brave
saint
have
heard
of
the
gate
of
heaven
but
last
night
we
were
there
was
supporting
her
in
his
arms
poor
dick
he
was
so
fond
of
her
and
it
was
so
hard
for
her
to
breathe
and
we
were
all
gathered
round
her
our
hearts
breaking
to
think
it
was
the
last
time
she
has
suffered
terribly
lately
but
at
the
last
the
pain
left
her
and
she
lay
with
the
very
rapture
of
heaven
on
her
dear
face
talking
so
brightly
of
how
we
should
do
after
she
had
gone
it
was
just
as
if
she
were
going
on
a
pleasure
trip
and
we
were
to
follow
later
she
turned
to
me
with
her
lovely
eyes
all
aglow
with
joy
and
said
give
my
bible
to
the
dear
child
in
the
valley
that
was
what
she
always
called
you
and
tell
her
miles
to
heaven
are
but
short
and
few
had
a
message
for
us
all
and
then
suddenly
just
as
the
dawn
broke
a
great
light
swept
over
her
face
and
she
turned
her
head
and
whispered
jesus
just
as
if
he
were
close
beside
her
and
then
she
was
gone
shall
never
forget
it
i
have
always
thought
of
death
as
the
king
of
terrors
but
last
night
it
was
the
coming
of
the
bridegroom
for
his
own
with
a
low
cry
pauline
head
dropped
there
could
never
be
anyone
just
like
lady
and
she
had
gone
away
the
hours
passed
silently
as
she
sat
benumbed
in
the
grasp
of
her
great
sorrow
suddenly
she
sprang
up
her
father
was
calling
her
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
had
a
bad
turn
send
stephen
for
the
doctor
and
come
quick
she
hurried
down
and
mechanically
heated
water
and
did
what
she
could
to
help
the
stricken
woman
but
before
the
doctor
could
reach
the
house
the
angel
of
death
had
swept
over
the
threshold
and
pauline
and
her
father
were
left
alone
a
letter
for
yer
pawliney
do
yer
wish
yer
may
git
it
and
lemuel
the
irrepressible
waved
it
at
her
tantalisingly
from
the
top
of
the
tall
hickory
where
he
had
perched
himself
like
the
monkey
that
he
was
she
saw
the
boston
and
stretched
out
her
hands
for
it
longingly
it
down
there
a
dear
boy
much
i
bet
leander
that
i
could
make
you
mad
an
he
bet
his
new
that
i
could
i
goin
to
chew
it
up
it
orful
thin
no
good
anyhow
you
wo
miss
it
and
crushing
the
letter
into
a
small
wad
he
put
it
into
his
capacious
mouth
it
was
as
lemuel
said
thin
not
much
like
the
volumes
which
belle
usually
wrote
she
had
not
been
able
to
distinguish
the
writing
but
of
course
it
must
be
from
belle
the
two
cousins
had
grown
very
near
to
each
other
as
the
years
rolled
by
and
a
summer
never
passed
without
some
of
her
uncle
family
spending
a
week
or
two
in
sleepy
hollow
those
were
pauline
days
the
bright
scintillating
points
where
she
was
brought
into
touch
again
with
the
world
of
thought
and
light
and
beauty
it
down
to
me
lemuel
dear
said
the
boy
coolly
goin
ter
tie
it
to
poll
balloon
an
let
go
of
the
string
an
then
it
go
straight
to
heaven
and
with
the
letter
reposing
in
his
cheek
he
began
to
sing
vociferously
i
want
ter
be
an
angel
an
with
the
angels
stand
a
crown
upon
my
forehead
a
harp
within
my
hand
mad
now
quick
fer
i
want
that
knife
orful
a
cry
from
polly
made
pauline
hurry
into
the
house
to
find
that
martha
spriggs
had
slipped
while
passing
the
child
couch
and
upset
a
bowl
of
scalding
milk
which
she
was
carrying
right
over
the
little
foot
in
the
confusion
which
followed
pauline
forgot
lemuel
and
her
letter
when
she
went
out
to
look
for
him
he
was
gone
it
to
me
now
lemuel
she
said
as
he
came
into
supper
had
enough
fun
for
i
used
it
fer
a
gun
wad
to
shoot
a
squirrel
with
the
cat
ate
the
squirrel
letter
an
all
yer
do
want
me
ter
kill
the
cat
do
yer
lemuel
she
cried
softly
could
you
how
could
you
do
it
she
sighed
sorrowfully
she
had
tried
so
hard
to
make
lemuel
a
good
boy
but
nothing
seemed
to
touch
him
and
young
as
he
was
the
neighbours
had
begun
to
lay
the
blame
of
every
misdeed
upon
his
shoulders
and
deacon
croaker
predicted
with
a
mournful
shake
of
his
head
good
will
ever
come
of
lemuel
harding
he
a
bad
lot
a
bad
lot
to
me
cried
polly
pain
awful
and
taking
the
weary
little
form
in
her
arms
pauline
sang
herself
back
into
her
usual
happy
trust
she
would
not
tell
belle
her
letter
had
been
destroyed
she
must
shield
lemuel
doing
my
best
she
said
to
herself
understands
yer
mad
yit
whispered
lemuel
anxiously
as
he
peered
into
the
bright
peaceful
face
on
his
way
to
bed
the
hand
that
stroked
his
tumbled
hair
was
very
gentle
lemuel
only
sorry
that
my
boy
forgot
the
king
was
looking
on
with
a
look
the
boy
hand
sought
his
pocket
but
satan
whispered
may
be
mad
and
he
crept
away
are
you
teasing
pauline
about
asked
stephen
as
he
went
upstairs
doin
nuthin
was
the
sullen
reply
you

in
her
eyes

sudden
or
i
give
you
something

ter

said
the
boy
doggedly
as
he
reached
his
room
goin
ter
give
her
the
old
letter
anyway
but
now
i
do
care
if
she
never
gits
it
and
opening
the
chest
which
held
his
few
treasures
he
deliberately
shut
up
the
letter
in
an
old
tin
box
and
went
to
bed
is
gettin
so
mortal
queer
said
stephen
discontentedly
he
tells
me
to
the
upper
lot
and
then
right
off
he
wants

to
harness
up
and
go
to
the
mill

quoted
softly
go
stephen
you
and
lemuel

the
only
ones
on
the
farm
now
and
father
is
getting
old
she
spoke
sadly
she
had
noticed
with
a
sinking
heart
how
her
father
was
the
years
had
slipped
by
until
polly
was
seventeen
a
very
frail
little
body
she
was
but
always
so
patient
and
sweet
that
pauline
never
grudged
the
constant
care
two
of
the
boys
had
taken
the
shaping
of
their
own
lives
and
gone
away
and
susan
ann
had
a
home
of
her
own
with
two
little
children
to
call
her
mother
jog
along
together
stephen
she
said
in
her
bright
cheery
way
forgets
now
and
then
but
he
does
mean
any
harm
and
only
one
day
at
a
time
you
know
stephen
looked
at
her
admiringly
a
brick
pawliney
and
i
guess
if
you
can
stand
it
i
ought
to
be
able
to
with
you
round
making
the
sunshine
i
be
a
brute
to
go
and
leave
you
and
lem
with
it
all
on
your
shoulders
and
the
honest
fellow
went
in
to
give
polly
a
kiss
before
he
started
for
the
mill
clearing
out
an
old
trunk
next
day
pauline
came
across
a
soiled
tumbled
envelope
it
was
the
letter
which
lemuel
had
tucked
away
and
forgotten
while
he
waited
for
her
to
mad
she
opened
it
eagerly
it
was
from
richard
everidge
should
like
to
come
down
and
see
you
he
wrote
sleepy
hollow
that
is
if
you
care
to
have
me
and
it
is
quite
convenient
do
not
trouble
to
write
unless
you
want
me
if
i
do
not
get
an
answer
i
shall
know
you
do
not
care
richard
everidge
had
been
married
for
three
years
now
and
had
a
little
girl
she
clasped
her
hands
with
one
quick
cry
of
pain
what
must
he
have
thought
of
her
all
these
years
her
friend
who
had
always
been
so
kind
so
kind
called
her
father
in
the
querulous
accents
of
one
whose
brain
is
weakening
i
wish
you
come
down
and
sing
a
little
the
house
is
terrible
lonesome
since
mother
gone
and
pauline
sang
in
her
full
sweet
tones
god
moves
in
a
mysterious
way
his
wonders
to
perform
is
good
pawliney
father
never
makes
mistakes
no
father
believe
that
pawliney
yes
i
know
it
father
and
her
voice
rang
out
triumphantly
in
another
stanza
judge
not
the
lord
by
feeble
sense
but
trust
him
for
his
grace
behind
a
frowning
providence
he
hides
a
smiling
face
the
angel
of
patience
the
mortgage
money
pawliney
said
stephen
as
he
handed
her
a
roll
of
not
due
for
a
month
yet
but
i
be
away
for
a
week
at
the
bend
and
if
father
gets
hold
of
it
he
take
it
to
make
matches
of
as
like
as
not
you
better
stow
it
away
somewheres
till
the
time
comes
well
stephen
i
put
it
in
my
strong
box
and
carry
the
key
in
my
pocket
you
wo
be
away
at
the
bend
any
longer
than
you
can
help
stephen
it
such
a
comfort
to
have
you
in
the
house
they
were
standing
by
the
light
waggon
which
lemuel
had
brought
round
from
the
barn
ready
for
stephen
journey
know
about
the
comfort
part
pawliney
said
stephen
with
a
queer
choke
in
his
voice
like
as
if
we
all
depended
on
you
for
that
commodity
but
i
be
as
quick
as
i
kin
all
of
you
git
along
goliath
three
days
had
passed
since
his
departure
and
pauline
stood
in
the
doorway
feasting
her
eyes
on
the
lights
and
shadows
which
grouped
themselves
about
the
distant
hills
when
lemuel
brushed
past
her
clad
in
his
sunday
best
lemuel
she
cried
astonished
have
had
your
supper
yet
where
are
you
going
china
was
the
brusque
response
hed
enuff
of
sleepy
hollow
an
bein
ordered
round
by
an
old
man
with
his
head
in
the
moon
lemuel
do

an
before
i

the
thing

lemuel
gasped

what
he
says
said
the
boy
roughly
ai
my
boss
lemuel
you
ca
mean
it
cried
pauline
as
she
followed
him
down
the
path
to
the
main
road
if
i
do
and
he
strode
away
from
her
and
vaulted
over
the
gate
what
will
father
do
somebody
that
ez
loony
ez
himself
i
ai
was
the
jeering
reply
you
must
go
it
will
kill
father
and
pauline
stretched
out
her
hands
to
him
appealingly
a
mocking
laugh
was
the
only
reply
as
he
disappeared
round
a
bend
of
the
road
pauline
went
slowly
back
to
the
house
feeling
bruised
and
stunned
piped
her
father
in
his
shrill
voice
lemuel
i
told
him
to
take
the
horse
to
the
forge
and
hoe
the
potatoes
and
weed
the
onions
and
go
to
the
woods
for
a
load
i
do
see
how
i
to
get
through
with
such
a
lot
of
heedless
boys
around
what
hev
you
done
with
him
you
just
spoil
them
all
with
your
cossetin
will
all
come
right
father
said
pauline
soothingly
has
gone
away
for
awhile
echoed
the
old
man
suspiciously
pawliney
did
you
know
he
was
going
father
he
will
be
back
and
stephen
will
be
home
next
week
she
paced
her
room
that
night
with
a
heavy
heart
there
was
no
way
to
hinder
the
misguided
boy
before
stephen
could
follow
him
he
would
be
on
the
sea
he
had
often
declared
he
meant
to
be
a
sailor
suddenly
she
stopped
the
lid
of
her
strong
box
had
been
forced
open
with
an
awful
dread
at
her
heart
she
lifted
it
and
looked
in
the
money
was
gone
with
a
bitter
cry
she
fell
upon
her
knees
thief
her
lemuel
the
boy
that
she
had
borne
with
and
prayed
over
all
these
years
and
the
money
was
due
in
a
month
what
should
she
do
stephen
must
never
know
stephen
with
his
stalwart
honesty
and
upright
soul
his
anger
would
be
terrible
and
she
must
shield
lemuel
all
she
could
poor
lemuel
all
night
long
she
pondered
sorrowfully
when
the
morning
came
she
went
to
deacon
croaker
hear
you
are
behindhand
with
your
wool
she
said
in
her
straightforward
way

and
deacon
may
i
ask
you
as
a
favour
to

thinks

the
best
spinner
in
the
valley
thank

i
will
wait

here
the
old
man
hobbled
into
the
house
and
she
stood
waiting
clothed
in
her
sorrow
and
shame
lemuel
ben
an
tuk
french
leave
he
said
as
he
handed
her
the
money

i

pauline
said
gravely
he
ca
get
away
from
god
deacon
croaker
she
counted
the
bills
as
she
hurried
along
it
would
just
make
enough
with
the
butter
money
that
was
all
she
had
for
clothes
for
herself
and
polly
but
polly
had
enough
for
a
while
and
she
could
go
without
in
the
evenings
long
after
the
others
were
in
bed
she
paced
up
and
down
the
kitchen
spinning
deacon
croaker
wool
into
smooth
even
threads
but
her
heart
ached
as
she
prayed
for
her
boy
and
often
when
in
the
still
watches
of
the
night
polly
kept
her
vigils
with
pain
she
heard
her
cry
softly
lemuel
oh
how
could
you
how
could
you
do
it
her
uncle
family
were
living
abroad
now
and
it
was
from
paris
that
belle
wrote
announcing
her
engagement
to
reginald
gordon
imagine
paul
the
letter
went
on
of
all
possible
people
a
missionary
wife
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
my
precious
saint
your
splendid
consecrated
life
made
me
tingle
with
shame
to
my
finger
tips
when
i
thought
of
my
aimless
existence
and
when
i
remembered
how
you
took
up
your
cross
and
followed
your
master
to
sleepy
hollow
there
seemed
to
be
no
reason
why
i
should
not
follow
him
to
africa
if
it
will
comfort
you
i
want
you
to
know
that
you
have
been
the
guiding
star
which
has
led
me
out
of
the
sloth
of
my
selfishness
into
active
work
for
the
king
the
years
slipped
by
peacefully
after
that
her
father
grew
daily
more
childish
and
needed
more
constant
watching
but
she
found
time
to
read
to
polly
many
a
snatch
from
her
favourite
authors
and
tryphosa
bible
lay
always
open
near
her
hand
at
last
the
day
came
when
in
the
full
noontide
her
father
had
called
to
her
in
his
weak
voice
gettin
dark
pawliney
and
lemuel
not
come
home
and
she
had
answered
with
her
brave
sweet
faith
yet
father
but
he
come
god
knows
god
knows
said
the
old
man
with
a
peaceful
smile
think
go
to
sleep
now
i
very
tired
you
been
a
good
girl
pawliney
a
good
girl
god
bless
you
my
dear
when
the
evening
came
pauline
laid
her
hand
softly
on
the
wrinkled
brow
from
which
the
shadows
had
forever
lifted
old
father
she
whispered
little
i
thought
when
i
wished
you
and
i
could
leave
sleepy
hollow
that
you
would
be
the
first
one
to
go
away
ought
always
to
dress
in
silk
pauline
instead
of
calico
i
wish
you
could
and
polly
eyes
rested
on
her
with
a
world
of
love
in
their
depths
pauline
laughed
as
she
kissed
her
silly
child
do
you
know
that
cotton
grows
and
silk
has
to
be
spun
which
makes
it
costly
and
cotton
is
content
to
be
washed
in
spring
water
while
silk
has
to
be
bathed
in
tea
can
you
spare
me
for
a
whole
afternoon
do
you
think
if
i
leave
carlyle
and
whittier
by
your
pillow
are
you
going
i
want
to
take
some
apple
custard
to
that
poor
dan
who
fell
from
the
haymow
and
i
must
go
and
see
how
susan
children
are
getting
through
the
measles
then
old
mrs
croaker
wants
to
be
sung
to
and
the
widow
larkin
wants
to
be
read
to
and
matilda
jones
is
jest
pinin
fer
a
talk
she
laughed
merrily
never
saw
anyone
get
so
much
into
their
lives
said
polly
wistfully
am
so
useless
blessed
child
cried
pauline
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
are
our
angel
of
patience
do
ever
call
yourself
useless
dear
you
are
the
centre
of
gravity
for
stephen
and
me
when
the
twilight
fell
she
sat
in
her
favourite
position
near
the
open
door
looking
up
at
the
clouds
as
she
made
polly
laugh
with
merry
descriptions
of
her
different
visits
suddenly
she
grew
still
for
a
bearded
man
had
crossed
the
threshold
and
thrown
a
paper
into
her
lap
saying
huskily
the
mortgage
pauline
to
make
a
bonfire
of
i
come
home
to
stay
before
he
had
finished
her
arms
were
around
his
neck
and
polly
heard
her
cry
softly
with
the
break
of
a
great
gladness
in
her
voice
why
lemuel
pure
gold
richard
everidge
sat
in
his
handsome
library
one
evening
in
early
summer
reading
a
letter
from
his
only
child
muriel
the
joy
of
his
heart
dearest
papa
we
are
stopping
now
in
the
quaintest
little
place
a
veritable
sleepy
hollow
like
its
name
where
rip
van
winkle
might
have
snoozed
away
for
centuries
without
fear
of
being
disturbed
i
advised
you
in
my
last
we
were
on
our
way
to
farningham
when
something
went
wrong
with
the
engine
and
we
had
to
stop
here
for
repairs
and
mamma
was
so
charmed
with
this
little
village
that
she
decided
to
stay
awhile
she
says
it
seems
to
suit
her
better
than
any
place
she
has
seen
poor
mamma
i
wish
i
could
find
some
place
where
she
would
be
satisfied
to
me
all
the
world
seems
so
beautiful
but
she
says
no
one
knows
how
to
sympathise
with
her
peculiar
organisation
was
saturday
on
sunday
morning
i
went
to
the
little
church
mamma
was
too
tired
and
now
comes
the
best
part
of
the
story
i
was
looking
round
watching
the
different
families
all
in
their
sunday
best
coming
in
and
getting
seated
when
suddenly
a
woman
voice
began
to
lead
the
little
choir
i
looked
up
with
a
start
she
was
tall
and
slender
and
as
she
stood
with
lifted
head
singing
her
heart
out
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
such
a
splendid
carriage
even
at
the
reception
in
washington
she
looked
like
a
princess
among
the
plain
farmer
folk
for
a
crown
she
had
a
mass
of
lovely
soft
white
hair
and
the
sweetest
clearest
eyes
i
ever
saw
when
she
was
singing
coronation
which
was
quite
appropriate
for
a
princess
it
seemed
as
if
she
would
lift
the
whole
congregation
up
to
god
the
service
i
could
not
help
watching
her
for
a
minute
for
as
you
will
have
imagined
ere
this
my
silly
heart
went
out
to
her
at
once
she
was
the
centre
of
a
group
every
one
seemed
to
have
something
to
say
to
her
and
she
was
so
nice
with
them
all
kissing
the
children
and
having
a
bright
smile
and
word
for
some
of
the
most
uninteresting
women
and
boys
i
ever
saw
just
as
i
was
going
out
of
the
door
i
felt
a
soft
touch
upon
my
arm
and
turned
to
find
her
beside
me
i
am
free
to
confess
i
never
received
such
a
welcome
to
any
church
before
i
gave
her
my
name
she
looked
puzzled
for
a
minute
everidge
she
repeated
it
is
it
must
be
she
would
be
just
about
your
age
i
believe
you
are
the
little
muriel
that
my
cousin
belle
used
to
write
about
you
must
come
home
with
me
at
once
your
father
was
my
dear
friend
in
the
long
ago
so
here
we
are
ensconced
with
my
princess
she
has
a
wonderful
way
with
her
for
mamma
came
without
making
the
slightest
objection
and
seems
happier
than
i
have
seen
her
for
months
are
just
four
in
the
family
besides
martha
spriggs
the
funny
old
girl
my
princess
and
her
two
stepbrothers
stephen
and
lemuel
and
polly
who
has
been
a
sufferer
from
spinal
trouble
all
her
life
is
the
quaintest
old
house
with
low
small
rooms
except
on
the
east
side
where
captain
lemuel
has
added
two
large
rooms
with
the
loveliest
bay
windows
which
are
always
full
of
flowers
and
sunshine
i
think
the
neighbours
are
horrified
that
they
use
them
for
common
you
know
country
people
always
keep
their
best
parlours
done
up
in
must
and
green
paper
but
the
princess
says
nothing
is
too
good
for
polly
and
the
boys
they
just
idolize
her
and
i
fancy
they
have
good
reason
to
for
as
stephen
said
in
his
queer
blunt
way
she
comes
as
near
to
an
angel
as
any
mortal
ever
will
captain
lemuel
has
been
all
over
the
world
and
is
very
interesting
mamma
is
so
amused
over
his
stories
stephen
is
blunt
but
i
should
be
afraid
to
trust
him
with
every
cent
i
owned
and
polly
is
just
a
bundle
of
sweetness
and
patience
i
wish
you
could
see
how
gentle
these
great
strong
men
are
with
her
stephen
wo
let
any
one
but
himself
carry
her
to
bed
and
lemuel
is
always
ready
to
push
her
about
in
her
wheel
chair
and
talk
nonsense
to
her
till
she
laughs
and
cries
together
the
princess
she
is
just
everything
to
everybody
i
can
not
fancy
what
the
house
would
be
without
her
i
only
hope
she
die
before
polly
for
i
sure
it
would
kill
her
she
never
takes
her
eyes
off
her
when
she
is
in
the
room
and
when
i
teased
her
a
little
about
it
her
eyes
filled
and
she
cried
softly
it
little
wonder
if
i
do
love
her
after
thirty
years
of
such
nursing
as
no
one
even
dreamed
of
it
made
me
almost
wish
to
be
sick
myself
has
such
a
merry
tender
way
with
her
i
do
not
wonder
lemuel
says
they
do
mind
rainy
weather
since
pauline
makes
sunshine
to
order
and
she
is
the
busiest
creature
i
believe
she
carries
the
whole
of
sleepy
hollow
on
her
heart
and
shoulders
she
seems
to
have
all
the
destitute
and
afflicted
under
her
wing
and
dispenses
and
bible
promises
with
the
same
liberal
hand
papa
i
am
so
glad
we
were
detained
at
sleepy
hollow
for
at
last
i
have
found
what
i
have
been
looking
for
an
absolutely
life
your
own
little
daughter
richard
everidge
remained
deep
in
thought
for
a
long
time
after
he
had
kissed
the
large
girlish
signature
then
he
drew
a
sheet
of
paper
towards
him
and
wrote
in
his
clear
bold
hand
darling
muriel
i
knew
your
princess
as
she
says
in
the
long
ago
and
she
is
as
you
have
found
her
pure
gold
the
most
of
your
visit
for
next
to
your
bible
she
is
the
best
teacher
you
could
have
your
loving
the
days
lengthened
into
weeks
and
the
everidges
were
still
at
the
farm
should
you
go
pauline
said
in
her
cheery
unanswerable
way
when
they
spoke
of
leaving
does
us
good
to
have
you
and
it
does
you
good
to
be
here
and
muriel
and
her
mother
were
content
said
the
girl
one
day
as
she
watched
her
moving
lightly
about
the
kitchen
envy
you
your
altitude
pauline
laughed
merrily
dear
child
every
one
gets
up
the
mountain
if
they
keep
on
climbing
i
have
not
an
atom
of
perseverance
sighed
muriel
seems
such
a
tremendous
undertaking
to
me
me
give
you
what
was
to
me
the
beginning
of
all
gospels
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
just
as
near
us
as
our
work
is
for
the
gate
of
heaven
for
each
soul
lies
in
the
endeavour
to
do
that
work
perfectly
princess
you
are
such
a
royal
creature
it
seems
such
a
waste
for
you
to
be
buried
here
king
never
wastes
little
one
if
we
have
the
angel
aim
and
standard
we
can
consecrate
the
smallest
acts
do
you
know
that
he
who
aims
for
perfectness
in
a
trifle
is
trying
to
do
that
trifle
holily
dear
princess
you
make
me
think
of
one
of
murillo
pictures
in
the
louvre
which
we
saw
when
we
were
abroad
last
year
it
is
the
interior
of
a
convent
kitchen
and
instead
of
mortals
in
old
dresses
doing
the
work
there
are
beautiful
angels
one
puts
the
kettle
on
the
fire
and
one
is
lifting
up
a
pail
of
water
and
one
is
at
the
kitchen
dresser
reaching
up
for
plates
pauline
smiled
is
it
exactly
how
can
anything
we
do
be
common
when
we
remember
our
inheritance
you
call
me
princess
out
of
love
little
one
but
i
am
a
princess
in
reality
for
my
father
is
a
king
let
me
give
you
a
good
word
which
your
father
gave
me
long
ago
if
you
can
not
realize
your
ideal
you
can
at
least
idealize
your
real
i
have
been
trying
to
do
it
ever
since
is
just
like
papa
said
muriel
with
a
proud
smile
says
you
are
pure
gold
princess
rich
did
your
father
say
that
cried
pauline
and
muriel
looked
up
to
see
a
soft
flush
in
her
face
while
her
eyes
shone
daughter
is
all
glorious
within
she
repeated
slowly
clothing
is
of
wrought
gold
then
she
chanted
in
her
clear
triumphant
voice
they
have
clean
robes
white
robes
white
robes
are
waiting
for
me
little
one
the
court
dress
of
heaven
differs
somewhat
from
that
of
earth
princess
said
muriel
wistfully
work
and
cooking
and
washing
dishes
over
and
over
it
seems
such
drudgery
a
great
light
broke
over
her
face
and
she
cried
in
a
low
exultant
tone
blessed
be
drudgery
christ
bore
it
for
thirty
years
why
should
i
mind
for
i
have
only
to
wait
a
little
now
for
the
fulness
of
joy
and
pleasures
for
evermore
muriel
threw
her
arms
about
her
and
kissed
her
softly
our
princess
will
be
at
home
she
whispered
