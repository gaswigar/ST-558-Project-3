preface
what
the
child
imitates
says
froebel
he
begins
to
understand
let
him
represent
the
flying
of
birds
and
he
enters
partially
into
the
life
of
birds
let
him
imitate
the
rapid
motion
of
fishes
in
the
water
and
his
sympathy
with
fishes
is
quickened
let
him
reproduce
the
activities
of
farmer
miller
and
baker
and
his
eyes
open
to
the
meaning
of
their
work
in
one
word
let
him
reflect
in
his
play
the
varied
aspects
of
life
and
his
thought
will
begin
to
grapple
with
their
significance
in
all
times
and
among
all
nations
have
been
a
delight
of
childhood
countless
babies
have
laughed
and
crowed
over
and
other
performances
of
the
soft
little
hands
while
children
of
whatever
age
never
fail
to
find
amusement
in
playing
here
is
the
church
and
here
the
steeple
open
the
doors
and
here
are
the
people
and
others
as
well
known
yet
it
is
not
solely
upon
the
pleasure
derived
from
them
that
depend
for
their
by
their
judicious
and
early
use
the
development
of
strength
and
flexibility
in
the
tiny
lax
fingers
may
be
assisted
and
dormant
thought
may
receive
its
first
awakening
call
through
the
motions
which
interpret
as
well
as
illustrate
the
phase
of
life
or
activity
presented
by
the
words
the
eighteen
contained
in
this
book
have
already
through
publication
in
babyland
been
introduced
to
their
especial
public
and
have
been
much
used
in
homes
though
perhaps
more
in
kindergartens
it
will
readily
be
seen
that
while
some
of
the
plays
are
for
the
babies
in
the
nursery
others
are
more
suitable
for
older
children
a
ten
months
old
plays
all
for
baby
throughout
pounding
and
clapping
gleefully
with
all
his
might
while
children
seven
or
eight
years
of
age
play
and
sing
the
caterpillar
how
the
corn
grew
and
others
with
very
evident
enjoyment
with
a
little
study
of
the
charming
and
expressive
pictures
with
which
the
artist
bridgman
has
so
sympathetically
illustrated
the
rhymes
mothers
and
kindergartners
have
easily
understood
what
motions
were
intended
to
elucidate
still
farther
however
the
playing
of
the
merry
little
men
may
be
thus
described
during
the
singing
of
the
first
verse
the
children
look
about
in
every
direction
for
the
little
men
but
keep
the
hands
hidden
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
verse
raise
both
hands
to
full
view
with
fingers
outspread
and
quiet
at
the
words
the
first
to
come
let
the
thumbs
be
shown
alone
then
the
others
as
named
in
turn
till
all
are
again
outspread
as
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
verse
in
the
last
verse
the
arms
are
moved
from
side
to
side
hands
being
raised
and
fingers
fluttering
nimbly
all
the
time
when
displaying
the
busy
little
men
raise
the
hands
as
high
as
possible
the
music
composed
by
miss
cornelia
roeske
will
be
found
melodious
and
attractive
and
especially
suited
to
the
voices
and
abilities
of
the
very
young
children
for
whom
it
is
chiefly
intended
the
harmonic
arrangement
is
also
purposely
simple
in
consideration
of
the
many
mothers
and
kindergartners
who
can
not
devote
time
to
preparatory
practice
