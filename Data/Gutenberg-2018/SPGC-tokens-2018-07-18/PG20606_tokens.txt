days
later
noah
arrived
by
elephant
ai
it
pretty
said
the
beyond
it
he
could
see
dim
piles
that
looked
like
churches
and
houses
i
say
wake
up
ca
you
floor
if
you
please
said
the
gaoler
politely
and
behind
him
the
clatter
of
hot
pursuit
he
heard
quite
a
loud
strong
big
voice
say
better
the
gigantic
porch
lowered
frowningly
above
him
he
walked
on
and
on
and
on
trespasser
said
noah
with
cold
dignity
then
something
hard
and
heavy
knocked
him
over
noah
whispered
ardently
so
all
down
the
wide
clear
floor
lucy
danced
on
the
top
of
a
very
large
and
wobbly
camel
it
was
heavy
work
turning
the
lions
over
slowly
they
came
to
the
great
gate
of
the
castle
your
camel
not
quite
fresh
i
can
mount
you
both
they
loved
looking
on
a
long
procession
toiled
slowly
up
it
of
animals
in
pairs
walked
straight
into
the
arms
of
helen
he
induced
them
to
build
him
a
temple
of
solid
gold
plunged
headlong
over
the
edge
the
bucket
began
to
go
up
lucy
threw
herself
across
the
well
parapet
and
all
the
while
it
had
to
go
on
turning
that
handle
philip
felt
that
it
was
best
to
stop
the
car
among
the
suburban
groves
of
southernwood
they
leapt
in
and
disappeared
chapter
i
the
beginning
philip
haldane
and
his
sister
lived
in
a
little
house
in
a
little
town
they
had
a
little
garden
and
a
little
balcony
and
a
little
stable
with
a
little
pony
in
it
and
a
little
cart
for
the
pony
to
draw
a
little
canary
hung
in
a
little
cage
in
the
little
and
the
neat
little
servant
kept
everything
as
bright
and
clean
as
a
little
new
pin
philip
had
no
one
but
his
sister
and
she
had
no
one
but
philip
their
parents
were
dead
and
helen
who
was
twenty
years
older
than
philip
and
was
really
his
was
all
the
mother
he
had
ever
known
and
he
had
never
envied
other
boys
their
mothers
because
helen
was
so
kind
and
clever
and
dear
she
gave
up
almost
all
her
time
to
him
she
taught
him
all
the
lessons
he
learned
she
played
with
him
inventing
the
most
wonderful
new
games
and
adventures
so
that
every
morning
when
philip
woke
he
knew
that
he
was
waking
to
a
new
day
of
joyous
and
interesting
happenings
and
this
went
on
till
philip
was
ten
years
old
and
he
had
no
least
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
it
would
go
on
for
ever
the
beginning
of
the
change
came
one
day
when
he
and
helen
had
gone
for
a
picnic
to
the
wood
where
the
waterfall
was
and
as
they
were
driving
back
behind
the
stout
old
pony
who
was
so
good
and
quiet
that
philip
was
allowed
to
drive
it
they
were
coming
up
the
last
lane
before
the
turning
where
their
house
was
and
helen
said
we
weed
the
aster
bed
and
have
tea
in
the
garden
said
philip
and
they
turned
the
corner
and
came
in
sight
of
their
white
little
garden
gate
and
a
man
was
coming
out
of
it
a
man
who
was
not
one
of
the
friends
they
both
knew
he
turned
and
came
to
meet
them
helen
put
her
hand
on
the
reins
a
thing
which
she
had
always
taught
philip
was
done
and
the
pony
stopped
the
man
who
was
as
philip
put
it
to
himself
and
tweedy
came
across
in
front
of
the
pony
nose
and
stood
close
by
the
wheel
on
the
side
where
helen
sat
she
shook
hands
with
him
and
said
do
you
do
in
quite
the
usual
way
but
after
that
they
whispered
whispered
and
philip
knew
how
rude
it
is
to
whisper
because
helen
had
often
told
him
this
he
heard
one
or
two
words
last
and
now
and
evening
then
after
that
helen
said
is
my
brother
philip
and
the
man
shook
hands
with
him
across
helen
another
thing
which
philip
knew
was
not
manners
and
said
hope
we
shall
be
the
best
of
friends
pip
said
do
you
do
because
that
is
the
polite
thing
to
say
but
inside
himself
he
said
do
want
to
be
friends
with
then
the
man
took
off
his
hat
and
walked
away
and
philip
and
his
sister
went
home
she
seemed
different
somehow
and
he
was
sent
to
bed
a
little
earlier
than
usual
but
he
could
not
go
to
sleep
for
a
long
time
because
he
heard
the
bell
ring
and
afterwards
a
man
voice
and
helen
going
on
and
on
in
the
little
under
the
room
which
was
his
bedroom
he
went
to
sleep
at
last
and
when
he
woke
up
in
the
morning
it
was
raining
and
the
sky
was
grey
and
miserable
he
lost
his
he
tore
one
of
his
stockings
as
he
pulled
it
on
he
pinched
his
finger
in
the
door
and
he
dropped
his
with
water
in
it
too
and
the
mug
was
broken
and
the
water
went
into
his
boots
there
are
mornings
you
know
when
things
happen
like
that
this
was
one
of
them
then
he
went
down
to
breakfast
which
tasted
not
quite
so
nice
as
usual
he
was
late
of
course
the
bacon
fat
was
growing
grey
with
waiting
for
him
as
helen
said
in
the
cheerful
voice
that
had
always
said
all
the
things
he
liked
best
to
hear
but
philip
did
smile
it
did
not
seem
the
sort
of
morning
for
smiling
and
the
grey
rain
beat
against
the
window
after
breakfast
helen
said
in
the
garden
is
indefinitely
postponed
and
it
too
wet
for
lessons
that
was
one
of
her
charming
ideas
that
wet
days
should
not
be
made
worse
by
lessons
shall
we
do
she
said
we
talk
about
the
island
shall
i
make
another
map
of
it
and
put
in
all
the
gardens
and
fountains
and
swings
the
island
was
a
favourite
play
somewhere
in
the
warm
seas
where
palm
trees
are
and
sands
the
island
was
said
to
be
their
own
island
beautified
by
their
fancy
with
everything
they
liked
and
wanted
and
philip
was
never
tired
of
talking
about
it
there
were
times
when
he
almost
believed
that
the
island
was
real
he
was
king
of
the
island
and
helen
was
queen
and
no
one
else
was
to
be
allowed
on
it
only
these
two
but
this
morning
even
the
thought
of
the
island
failed
to
charm
philip
straggled
away
to
the
window
and
looked
out
dismally
at
the
soaked
lawn
and
the
dripping
laburnum
trees
and
the
row
of
raindrops
hanging
fat
and
full
on
the
iron
gate
is
it
pippin
helen
asked
tell
me
you
going
to
have
horrid
measles
or
scarlet
fever
or
noisy
she
came
across
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
forehead
you
quite
hot
boy
of
my
heart
tell
sister
what
is
it
tell
said
philip
slowly
you
what
pip
think
you
ought
to
bear
it
alone
like
in
books
and
be
noble
and
all
that
but
you
tell
me
you
promised
you
never
have
any
secrets
from
me
helen
you
know
you
did
helen
put
her
arm
round
him
and
said
nothing
and
from
her
silence
pip
drew
the
most
desperate
and
harrowing
conclusions
the
silence
lasted
the
rain
gurgled
in
the
and
dripped
on
the
ivy
the
canary
in
the
green
cage
that
hung
in
the
window
put
its
head
on
one
side
and
tweaked
a
seed
husk
out
into
philip
face
then
twittered
defiantly
but
his
sister
said
nothing
said
philip
suddenly
break
it
to
me
tell
me
straight
out
you
what
she
said
again
is
it
he
said
know
how
these
unforetold
misfortunes
happen
some
one
always
comes
and
then
it
broken
to
the
family
is
she
asked
misfortune
said
philip
breathlessly
helen
i
not
a
baby
do
tell
me
have
we
lost
our
money
in
a
burst
bank
or
is
the
landlord
going
to
put
bailiffs
into
our
furniture
or
are
we
going
to
be
falsely
accused
about
forgery
or
being
burglars
all
the
books
philip
had
ever
read
worked
together
in
his
mind
to
produce
these
melancholy
suggestions
helen
laughed
and
instantly
felt
a
stiffening
withdrawal
of
her
brother
from
her
arm
no
my
pippin
dear
she
made
haste
to
say
horrid
like
that
has
happened
what
is
it
he
asked
with
a
growing
impatience
that
felt
like
a
wolf
gnawing
inside
him
did
want
to
tell
you
all
in
a
hurry
like
this
she
said
anxiously
do
you
worry
my
boy
of
boys
it
something
that
makes
me
very
happy
i
hope
it
will
you
too
he
swung
round
in
the
circling
of
her
arm
and
looked
at
her
with
sudden
ecstasy
helen
dear
i
know
some
one
has
left
you
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
a
year
some
one
you
once
opened
a
door
for
and
now
i
can
have
a
pony
of
my
very
own
to
ride
ca
i
said
helen
slowly
can
have
a
pony
but
nobody
left
me
anything
look
here
my
pippin
she
added
very
quickly
ask
any
more
questions
i
tell
you
when
i
was
quite
little
like
you
i
had
a
dear
friend
i
used
to
play
with
all
day
long
and
when
we
grew
up
we
were
friends
still
he
lived
quite
near
us
and
then
he
married
some
one
else
and
then
the
some
one
died
and
now
he
wants
me
to
marry
him
and
he
got
lots
of
horses
and
a
beautiful
house
and
park
she
added
where
shall
i
be
he
asked
me
of
course
wherever
i
am
wo
be
just
us
two
any
more
though
said
philip
you
said
it
should
be
for
ever
and
ever
i
did
know
then
pip
dear
he
been
wanting
me
so
long
want
you
said
pip
to
himself
he
got
a
little
girl
that
you
like
so
to
play
with
she
went
on
name
lucy
and
she
just
a
year
younger
than
you
and
you
be
the
greatest
friends
with
her
and
you
both
have
ponies
to
ride
and
hate
her
cried
philip
very
loud
i
hate
him
and
i
hate
their
beastly
ponies
and
i
hate
and
with
these
dreadful
words
he
flung
off
her
arm
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
banging
the
door
after
him
on
purpose
well
she
found
him
in
the
among
the
gaiters
and
goloshes
and
and
old
rackets
and
they
kissed
and
cried
and
hugged
each
other
and
he
said
he
was
sorry
he
had
been
naughty
but
in
his
heart
that
was
the
only
thing
he
was
sorry
for
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
made
helen
unhappy
he
still
hated
man
and
most
of
all
he
hated
lucy
he
had
to
be
polite
to
that
man
his
sister
was
very
fond
of
that
man
and
this
made
philip
hate
him
still
more
while
at
the
same
time
it
made
him
careful
not
to
show
how
he
hated
him
also
it
made
him
feel
that
hating
that
man
was
not
quite
fair
to
his
sister
whom
he
loved
but
there
were
no
feelings
of
that
kind
to
come
in
the
way
of
the
detestation
he
felt
for
lucy
helen
had
told
him
that
lucy
had
fair
hair
and
wore
it
in
two
plaits
and
he
pictured
her
to
himself
as
a
fat
stumpy
little
girl
exactly
like
the
little
girl
in
the
story
of
sugar
bread
in
the
old
oblong
peter
book
that
had
belonged
to
helen
when
she
was
little
helen
was
quite
happy
she
divided
her
love
between
the
boy
she
loved
and
the
man
she
was
going
to
marry
and
she
believed
that
they
were
both
as
happy
as
she
was
the
man
whose
name
was
peter
graham
was
happy
enough
the
boy
who
was
philip
was
amused
for
she
kept
him
so
but
under
the
amusement
he
was
miserable
and
the
came
and
went
and
philip
travelled
on
a
very
hot
afternoon
by
strange
trains
and
a
strange
carriage
to
a
strange
house
where
he
was
welcomed
by
a
strange
nurse
and
lucy
wo
mind
going
to
stay
at
peter
beautiful
house
without
me
will
you
dear
helen
had
asked
one
will
be
kind
to
you
and
you
have
lucy
to
play
with
and
philip
said
he
did
mind
what
else
could
he
say
without
being
naughty
and
making
helen
cry
again
lucy
was
not
a
bit
like
the
child
she
had
fair
hair
it
is
true
and
it
was
plaited
in
two
braids
but
they
were
very
long
and
straight
she
herself
was
long
and
lean
and
had
a
freckled
face
and
bright
jolly
eyes
so
glad
you
come
she
said
meeting
him
on
the
steps
of
the
most
beautiful
house
he
had
ever
seen
can
play
all
sort
of
things
now
that
you
ca
play
when
you
only
one
i
an
only
child
she
added
with
a
sort
of
melancholy
pride
then
she
laughed
only
rhymes
with
lonely
does
it
she
said
do
know
said
philip
with
deliberate
falseness
for
he
knew
quite
well
he
said
no
more
lucy
tried
two
or
three
other
beginnings
of
conversation
but
philip
contradicted
everything
she
said
afraid
he
very
very
stupid
she
said
to
her
nurse
an
extremely
trained
nurse
who
firmly
agreed
with
her
and
when
her
aunt
came
to
see
her
next
day
lucy
said
that
the
little
new
boy
was
stupid
and
disagreeable
as
well
as
stupid
and
philip
confirmed
this
opinion
of
his
behaviour
to
such
a
degree
that
the
aunt
who
was
young
and
affectionate
had
lucy
clothes
packed
at
once
and
carried
her
off
for
a
few
days
visit
so
philip
and
the
nurse
were
left
at
the
grange
there
was
nobody
else
in
the
house
but
servants
and
now
philip
began
to
know
what
loneliness
meant
the
letters
and
the
picture
which
his
sister
sent
every
day
from
the
odd
towns
on
the
continent
of
europe
which
she
visited
on
her
honeymoon
did
not
cheer
the
boy
they
merely
exasperated
him
reminding
him
of
the
time
when
she
was
all
his
own
and
was
too
near
to
him
to
need
to
send
him
and
letters
the
extremely
trained
nurse
who
wore
a
grey
uniform
and
white
cap
and
apron
disapproved
of
philip
to
the
depths
of
her
nature
little
pig
she
called
him
to
herself
to
the
housekeeper
she
said
is
an
unusually
difficult
and
disagreeable
child
i
should
imagine
that
his
education
has
been
much
neglected
he
wants
a
tight
hand
she
did
not
use
a
tight
hand
to
him
however
she
treated
him
with
an
indifference
more
annoying
than
tyranny
he
had
immense
liberty
of
a
desolate
empty
sort
the
great
house
was
his
to
go
to
and
fro
in
but
he
was
not
allowed
to
touch
anything
in
it
the
garden
was
his
to
wander
through
but
he
must
not
pluck
flowers
or
fruit
he
had
no
lessons
it
is
true
but
then
he
had
no
games
either
there
was
a
nursery
but
he
was
not
imprisoned
in
it
was
not
even
encouraged
to
spend
his
time
there
he
was
sent
out
for
walks
and
alone
for
the
park
was
large
and
safe
and
the
nursery
was
the
room
of
all
that
great
house
that
attracted
him
most
for
it
was
full
of
toys
of
the
most
fascinating
kind
a
as
big
as
a
pony
the
finest
dolls
house
you
ever
saw
boxes
of
boxes
of
bricks
both
the

every
kind
of

or

that
you
have
ever
had
or
ever
wished
to
have
and
pip
was
not
allowed
to
play
with
any
of
them

touch

if
you

the

said
with
that
icy
politeness
which
goes
with
a
uniform
toys
are
miss
lucy
no
i
could
be
responsible
for
giving
you
permission
to
play
with
them
no
i
could
think
of
troubling
miss
lucy
by
writing
to
ask
her
if
you
may
play
with
them
no
i
could
take
upon
myself
to
give
you
miss
lucy
address
for
philip
boredom
and
his
desire
had
humbled
him
even
to
the
asking
for
this
for
two
whole
days
he
lived
at
the
grange
hating
it
and
every
one
in
it
for
the
servants
took
their
cue
from
the
nurse
and
the
child
felt
that
in
the
whole
house
he
had
not
a
friend
somehow
he
had
got
the
idea
firmly
in
his
head
that
this
was
a
time
when
helen
was
not
to
be
bothered
about
anything
so
he
wrote
to
her
that
he
was
quite
well
thank
you
and
the
park
was
very
pretty
and
lucy
had
lots
of
nice
toys
he
felt
very
brave
and
noble
and
like
a
martyr
and
he
set
his
teeth
to
bear
it
all
it
was
like
spending
a
few
days
at
the
dentist
and
then
suddenly
everything
changed
the
nurse
got
a
telegram
a
brother
who
had
been
thought
to
be
drowned
at
sea
had
abruptly
come
home
she
must
go
to
see
him
it
costs
me
the
situation
she
said
to
the
housekeeper
who
answered
well
go
then
i
be
responsible
for
the
boy
sulky
little
brat
and
the
nurse
went
in
a
happy
bustle
she
packed
her
boxes
and
went
at
the
last
moment
philip
on
the
doorstep
watching
her
climb
into
the
suddenly
sprang
forward
nurse
he
cried
blundering
against
the
almost
moving
wheel
and
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
called
her
by
any
name
do
do
say
i
may
take
lucy
toys
to
play
with
it
so
lonely
here
i
may
may
i
i
may
take
them
perhaps
the
nurse
heart
was
softened
by
her
own
happiness
and
the
thought
of
the
brother
who
was
not
drowned
perhaps
she
was
only
in
such
a
hurry
that
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
saying
at
any
rate
when
philip
said
for
the
third
time
i
take
them
she
hastily
answered
the
child
take
anything
you
like
mind
the
wheel
for
sake
everybody
waved
her
hand
to
the
servants
assembled
at
the
top
of
the
wide
steps
and
was
whirled
off
to
joyous
reunion
with
the
undrowned
brother
philip
drew
a
deep
breath
of
satisfaction
went
straight
up
to
the
nursery
took
out
all
the
toys
and
examined
every
single
one
of
them
it
took
him
all
the
afternoon
the
next
day
he
looked
at
all
the
things
again
and
longed
to
make
something
with
them
he
was
accustomed
to
the
joy
that
comes
of
making
things
he
and
helen
had
built
many
a
city
for
the
dream
island
out
of
his
own
two
boxes
of
bricks
and
certain
other
things
in
the
house
her
japanese
cabinet
the
dominoes
and
chessmen
cardboard
boxes
books
the
lids
of
kettles
and
teapots
but
they
had
never
had
enough
bricks
lucy
had
enough
bricks
for
anything
he
began
to
build
a
city
on
the
nursery
table
but
to
build
with
bricks
alone
is
poor
work
when
you
have
been
used
to
building
with
all
sorts
of
other
things
looks
like
a
factory
said
philip
discontentedly
he
swept
the
building
down
and
replaced
the
bricks
in
their
different
boxes
must
be
something
downstairs
that
would
come
in
useful
he
told
himself
she
did
say
take
what
you
like
by
armfuls
two
and
three
at
a
time
he
carried
down
the
boxes
of
bricks
and
the
boxes
of
blocks
the
draughts
the
chessmen
and
the
box
of
dominoes
he
took
them
into
the
long
where
the
crystal
chandeliers
were
and
the
chairs
covered
in
brown
holland
and
the
many
long
light
windows
and
the
cabinets
and
tables
covered
with
the
most
interesting
things
he
cleared
a
big
of
such
useless
and
unimportant
objects
as
silver
inkstand
and
books
and
there
was
a
clear
space
for
his
city
he
began
to
build
a
bronze
egyptian
god
on
a
black
and
gold
cabinet
seemed
to
be
looking
at
him
from
across
the
room
right
said
philip
build
you
a
temple
you
wait
a
bit
the
bronze
god
waited
and
the
temple
grew
and
two
silver
candlesticks
topped
by
chessmen
served
admirably
as
pillars
for
the
portico
he
made
a
journey
to
the
nursery
to
fetch
the
noah
ark
animals
the
pair
of
elephants
each
standing
on
a
brick
flanked
the
entrance
it
looked
splendid
like
an
assyrian
temple
in
the
pictures
helen
had
shown
him
but
the
bricks
wherever
he
built
with
them
alone
looked
mean
and
like
factories
or
workhouses
bricks
alone
always
do
philip
explored
again
he
found
the
library
he
made
several
journeys
he
brought
up
volumes
bound
in
white
vellum
with
marbled
boards
a
set
of
shakespeare
ten
volumes
in
green
morocco
these
made
pillars
and
cloisters
dark
mysterious
and
attractive
more
noah
ark
animals
added
an
finish
to
the
building
ai
it
pretty
said
the
who
came
to
call
him
to
tea
are
clever
with
your
fingers
master
philip
i
will
say
that
for
you
but
you
catch
it
taking
all
them
things
grey
nurse
said
i
might
said
philip
it
does
hurt
things
building
with
them
my
sister
and
i
always
did
it
at
home
he
added
looking
confidingly
at
the
she
had
praised
his
building
and
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
mentioned
his
sister
to
any
one
in
that
house
it
as
good
as
a
said
the
just
like
them
picture
my
brother
in
india
sends
me
all
them
pillars
and
domes
and
things
and
the
animals
too
i
do
know
how
you
fare
to
think
of
such
things
that
i
do
illustration
ai
it
pretty
said
the
praise
is
sweet
he
slipped
his
hand
into
that
of
the
as
they
went
down
the
wide
stairs
to
the
hall
where
tea
awaited
him
a
very
little
tray
on
a
very
big
dark
table
not
half
a
bad
child
said
susan
at
her
tea
in
the
quarters
nurse
frightened
him
out
of
his
little
wits
with
her
prim
ways
you
may
depend
he
civil
enough
if
you
speak
him
civil
miss
lucy
did
frighten
him
i
suppose
said
the
cook
look
how
he
behaved
to
her
he
quiet
enough
anyhow
you
do
hear
a
breath
of
him
from
morning
till
night
said
the
upper
housemaid
to
me
slip
in
and
look
what
he
been
building
that
all
susan
told
them
wo
call
him
silly
then
india
an
pagodas
ai
in
it
they
did
slip
in
all
of
them
when
philip
had
gone
to
bed
the
building
had
progressed
though
it
was
not
finished
sha
touch
a
thing
said
susan
him
have
it
to
play
with
we
clear
it
all
away
before
that
nurse
comes
back
with
her
caps
and
her
collars
and
her
cheek
so
next
day
philip
went
on
with
his
building
he
put
everything
you
can
think
of
into
it
the
dominoes
and
the
bricks
and
books
that
he
begged
from
susan
and
a
and
some
contributed
by
the
cook
he
made
steps
of
the
dominoes
and
a
terrace
of
the
he
got
bits
of
southernwood
out
of
the
garden
and
stuck
them
in
which
made
beautiful
pots
and
they
looked
like
bay
trees
in
tubs
brass
served
for
domes
and
the
lids
of
brass
kettles
and
from
the
oak
dresser
in
the
hall
made
minarets
of
dazzling
splendour
chessmen
were
useful
for
minarets
too
must
have
paved
paths
and
a
fountain
said
philip
thoughtfully
the
paths
were
paved
with
card
counters
and
the
fountain
was
a
silver
and
glass
with
a
needlecase
of
filigree
silver
rising
up
from
the
middle
of
it
and
the
falling
water
was
made
quite
nicely
out
of
narrow
bits
of
the
silver
paper
off
the
chocolate
helen
had
given
him
at
parting
palm
trees
were
easily
made
helen
had
shown
him
how
to
do
that
with
bits
of
larch
fastened
to
elder
stems
with
plasticine
there
was
plenty
of
plasticine
among
lucy
toys
there
was
plenty
of
everything
and
the
city
grew
till
it
covered
the
table
philip
unwearied
set
about
to
make
another
city
on
another
table
this
had
for
chief
feature
a
great
with
a
fountain
round
its
base
and
now
he
stopped
at
nothing
he
unhooked
the
crystal
drops
from
the
great
chandeliers
to
make
his
fountains
this
city
was
grander
than
the
first
it
had
a
grand
tower
made
of
a
basket
and
an
astrologer
tower
that
was
a
machine
the
cities
were
really
very
beautiful
i
wish
i
could
describe
them
thoroughly
to
you
but
it
would
take
pages
and
pages
besides
all
the
things
i
have
told
of
alone
there
were
towers
and
turrets
and
grand
staircases
pagodas
and
pavilions
canals
made
bright
and
by
strips
of
silver
paper
and
a
lake
with
a
boat
on
it
philip
put
into
his
buildings
all
the
things
out
of
the
doll
house
that
seemed
suitable
the
wooden
and
dishes
the
leaden
and
goblets
he
peopled
the
place
with
dominoes
and
pawns
the
handsome
chessmen
were
used
for
minarets
he
made
forts
and
garrisoned
them
with
lead
soldiers
he
worked
hard
and
he
worked
cleverly
and
as
the
cities
grew
in
beauty
and
interestingness
he
loved
them
more
and
more
he
was
happy
now
there
was
no
time
to
be
unhappy
in
will
keep
it
as
it
is
till
helen
comes
how
she
will
it
he
said
the
two
cities
were
connected
by
a
bridge
which
was
a
he
had
found
in
the
servants
and
taken
without
hindrance
for
by
this
time
all
the
servants
were
his
friends
susan
had
been
the
first
that
was
all
he
had
just
laid
his
bridge
in
place
and
put
and
noah
in
the
chief
square
to
represent
the
inhabitants
and
was
standing
rapt
in
admiration
of
his
work
when
a
hard
hand
on
each
of
his
shoulders
made
him
start
and
scream
it
was
the
nurse
she
had
come
back
a
day
sooner
than
any
one
expected
her
the
brother
had
brought
home
a
wife
and
she
and
the
nurse
had
not
liked
each
other
so
she
was
very
cross
and
she
took
philip
by
the
shoulders
and
shook
him
a
thing
which
had
never
happened
to
him
before
naughty
wicked
boy
she
said
still
shaking
i
have
hurt
anything
i
put
everything
back
he
said
trembling
and
very
pale
not
touch
any
of
it
again
said
the
nurse
see
to
that
i
shall
put
everything
away
myself
in
the
morning
taking
what
belong
to
you
you
said
i
might
take
anything
i
liked
said
philip
if
wrong
it
your
fault
untruthful
child
cried
the
nurse
and
hit
him
over
the
knuckles
now
no
one
had
ever
hit
philip
before
he
grew
paler
than
ever
but
he
did
not
cry
though
his
hands
hurt
rather
badly
for
she
had
snatched
up
the
to
hit
him
with
and
it
was
hard
and
cornery
are
a
coward
said
philip
it
is
you
who
are
untruthful
and
not
me
your
tongue
said
the
nurse
and
whirled
him
off
to
bed
get
no
supper
so
there
she
said
angrily
tucking
him
up
do
want
any
said
philip
i
have
to
forgive
you
before
the
sun
goes
down
indeed
said
she
flouncing
out
you
get
sorry
you
know
i
forgiven
you
philip
called
after
her
which
of
course
made
her
angrier
than
ever
whether
philip
cried
when
he
was
alone
is
not
our
business
susan
who
had
watched
the
shaking
and
the
hitting
without
daring
to
interfere
crept
up
later
with
milk
and
she
found
him
asleep
and
she
says
his
eyelashes
were
wet
when
he
awoke
he
thought
at
first
that
it
was
morning
the
room
was
so
light
but
presently
he
saw
that
it
was
not
yellow
sunlight
but
white
moonshine
which
made
the
beautiful
brightness
he
wondered
at
first
why
he
felt
so
unhappy
then
he
remembered
how
helen
had
gone
away
and
how
hateful
the
nurse
had
been
and
now
she
would
pull
down
the
city
and
helen
would
never
see
it
and
he
would
never
be
able
to
build
such
a
beautiful
one
again
in
the
morning
it
would
be
gone
and
he
would
not
be
able
even
to
remember
how
it
was
built
the
moonlight
was
very
bright
wonder
how
my
city
looks
by
moonlight
he
said
and
then
all
in
a
thrilling
instant
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
down
and
see
for
himself
how
it
did
look
he
slipped
on
his
opened
his
door
softly
and
crept
along
the
corridor
and
down
the
broad
staircase
then
along
the
gallery
and
into
the
it
was
very
dark
but
he
felt
his
way
to
a
window
and
undid
the
shutter
and
there
lay
his
city
flooded
with
moonlight
just
as
he
had
imagined
it
he
gazed
on
it
for
a
moment
in
ecstasy
and
then
turned
to
shut
the
door
as
he
did
so
he
felt
a
slight
strange
giddiness
and
stood
a
moment
with
his
hand
to
his
head
he
turned
and
went
again
towards
the
city
and
when
he
was
close
to
it
he
gave
a
little
cry
hastily
stifled
for
fear
some
one
should
hear
him
and
come
down
and
send
him
to
bed
he
stood
and
gazed
about
him
bewildered
and
once
more
rather
giddy
for
the
city
had
in
a
quick
blink
of
light
followed
by
darkness
disappeared
so
had
the
so
had
the
chair
that
stood
close
to
the
table
he
could
see
mountainous
shapes
raising
enormous
heights
in
the
distance
and
the
moonlight
shone
on
the
tops
of
them
but
he
himself
seemed
to
be
in
a
vast
flat
plain
there
was
the
softness
of
long
grass
round
his
feet
but
there
were
no
trees
no
houses
no
hedges
or
fences
to
break
the
expanse
of
grass
it
seemed
darker
in
some
parts
than
others
that
was
all
it
reminded
him
of
the
illimitable
prairie
of
which
he
had
read
in
books
of
adventure
suppose
i
dreaming
said
philip
i
do
see
how
i
can
have
gone
to
sleep
just
while
i
was
turning
the
door
handle
however
he
stood
still
expecting
that
something
would
happen
in
dreams
something
always
does
happen
if
it
only
that
the
dream
comes
to
an
end
but
nothing
happened
now
philip
just
stood
there
quite
quietly
and
felt
the
warm
soft
grass
round
his
ankles
then
as
his
eyes
became
used
to
the
darkness
of
the
plain
he
saw
some
way
off
a
very
steep
bridge
leading
up
to
a
dark
height
on
whose
summit
the
moon
shone
whitely
he
walked
towards
it
and
as
he
approached
he
saw
that
it
was
less
like
a
bridge
than
a
sort
of
ladder
and
that
it
rose
to
a
giddy
height
above
him
it
seemed
to
rest
on
a
rock
far
up
against
dark
sky
and
the
inside
of
the
rock
seemed
hollowed
out
in
one
vast
dark
cave
illustration
beyond
it
he
could
see
dim
piles
that
looked
like
churches
and
houses
and
now
he
was
close
to
the
foot
of
the
ladder
it
had
no
rungs
but
narrow
ledges
made
hold
for
feet
and
hands
philip
remembered
jack
and
the
beanstalk
and
looked
up
longingly
but
the
ladder
was
a
very
very
long
one
on
the
other
hand
it
was
the
only
thing
that
seemed
to
lead
anywhere
and
he
had
had
enough
of
standing
lonely
in
the
grassy
prairie
where
he
seemed
to
have
been
for
a
very
long
time
indeed
so
he
put
his
hands
and
feet
to
the
ladder
and
began
to
go
up
it
was
a
very
long
climb
there
were
three
hundred
and
eight
steps
for
he
counted
them
and
the
steps
were
only
on
one
side
of
the
ladder
so
he
had
to
be
extremely
careful
on
he
went
up
and
on
on
and
up
till
his
feet
ached
and
his
hands
felt
as
though
they
would
drop
off
for
tiredness
he
could
not
look
up
far
and
he
dared
not
look
down
at
all
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
climb
and
climb
and
climb
and
at
last
he
saw
the
ground
on
which
the
ladder
rested
a
terrace
hewn
in
regular
lines
and
as
it
seemed
hewn
from
the
solid
rock
his
head
was
level
with
the
ground
now
his
hands
now
his
feet
he
leaped
sideways
from
the
ladder
and
threw
himself
face
down
on
the
ground
which
was
cold
and
smooth
like
marble
there
he
lay
drawing
deep
breaths
of
weariness
and
relief
there
was
a
great
silence
all
about
which
rested
and
soothed
and
presently
he
rose
and
looked
around
him
he
was
close
to
an
archway
with
very
thick
pillars
and
he
went
towards
it
and
peeped
cautiously
in
it
seemed
to
be
a
great
gate
leading
to
an
open
space
and
beyond
it
he
could
see
dim
piles
that
looked
like
churches
and
houses
but
all
was
deserted
the
moonlight
and
he
had
the
place
whatever
it
was
to
themselves
suppose
every
one
in
bed
said
philip
and
stood
there
trembling
a
little
but
very
curious
and
interested
in
the
black
shadow
of
the
strange
arch
chapter
ii
deliverer
or
destroyer
philip
stood
in
the
shadow
of
the
dark
arch
and
looked
out
he
saw
before
him
a
great
square
surrounded
by
tall
irregular
buildings
in
the
middle
was
a
fountain
whose
waters
silver
in
the
moonlight
rose
and
fell
with
gentle
plashing
sound
a
tall
tree
close
to
the
archway
cast
the
shadow
of
its
trunk
across
the
path
a
broad
black
bar
he
listened
listened
listened
but
there
was
nothing
to
listen
to
except
the
deep
night
silence
and
the
changing
soft
sound
the
fountain
made
his
eyes
growing
accustomed
to
the
dimness
showed
him
that
he
was
under
a
heavy
domed
roof
supported
on
large
square
pillars
to
the
right
and
left
stood
dark
doors
shut
fast
will
explore
these
doors
by
daylight
he
said
he
did
not
feel
exactly
frightened
but
he
did
not
feel
exactly
brave
either
but
he
wished
and
intended
to
be
brave
so
he
said
will
explore
these
doors
at
least
i
think
i
will
he
added
for
one
must
not
only
be
brave
but
truthful
and
then
suddenly
he
felt
very
sleepy
he
leaned
against
the
wall
and
presently
it
seemed
that
sitting
down
would
be
less
trouble
and
then
that
lying
down
would
be
more
truly
comfortable
a
bell
from
very
very
far
away
sounded
the
hour
twelve
philip
counted
up
to
nine
but
he
missed
the
tenth
and
the
eleventh
and
the
twelfth
as
well
because
he
was
fast
asleep
cuddled
up
warmly
in
the
thick
quilted
that
helen
had
made
him
last
winter
he
dreamed
that
everything
was
as
it
used
to
be
before
that
man
came
and
changed
everything
and
took
helen
away
he
was
in
his
own
little
bed
in
his
own
little
room
in
their
own
little
house
and
helen
had
come
to
call
him
he
could
see
the
sunlight
through
his
closed
eyelids
he
was
keeping
them
closed
just
for
the
fun
of
hearing
her
try
to
wake
him
and
presently
he
would
tell
her
he
had
been
awake
all
the
time
and
they
would
laugh
together
about
it
and
then
he
awoke
and
he
was
not
in
his
soft
bed
at
home
but
on
the
hard
floor
of
a
big
strange
and
it
was
not
helen
who
was
shaking
him
and
saying
i
say
wake
up
ca
you
but
a
tall
man
in
a
red
coat
and
the
light
that
dazzled
his
eyes
was
not
from
the
sun
at
all
but
from
a
horn
lantern
which
the
man
was
holding
close
to
his
face
the
matter
said
philip
sleepily
the
question
said
the
man
in
red
along
to
the
and
give
an
account
of
yourself
you
young
shaver
he
took
philip
ear
gently
but
firmly
between
a
very
hard
finger
and
thumb
go
said
philip
not
going
to
run
away
and
he
stood
up
feeling
very
brave
the
man
shifted
his
hold
from
ear
to
shoulder
and
led
philip
through
one
of
those
doors
which
he
had
thought
of
exploring
by
daylight
it
was
not
daylight
yet
and
the
room
large
and
bare
with
an
arch
at
each
end
and
narrow
little
windows
at
the
sides
was
lighted
by
horn
lanterns
and
tall
tapers
in
pewter
candlesticks
it
seemed
to
philip
that
the
room
was
full
of
soldiers
their
captain
with
a
good
deal
of
gold
about
him
and
a
very
smart
black
moustache
got
up
from
a
bench
what
i
caught
sir
said
the
man
who
owned
the
hand
on
philip
shoulder
said
the
captain
it
really
happened
at
last
illustration
i
say
wake
up
ca
you
has
said
philip
you
have
said
the
captain
be
frightened
little
man
not
frightened
said
philip
and
added
politely
should
be
so
much
obliged
if
you
tell
me
what
you
mean
he
added
something
which
he
had
heard
people
say
when
they
asked
the
way
to
the
market
or
the
public
gardens
quite
a
stranger
here
he
said
a
jolly
roar
of
laughter
went
up
from
the
is
manners
to
laugh
at
strangers
said
philip
your
own
manners
said
the
captain
sharply
this
country
little
boys
speak
when
they
spoken
to
stranger
eh
well
we
knew
that
you
know
philip
though
he
felt
snubbed
yet
felt
grand
too
here
he
was
in
the
middle
of
an
adventure
with
soldiers
he
threw
out
his
chest
and
tried
to
look
manly
the
captain
sat
down
in
a
chair
at
the
end
of
a
long
table
drew
a
black
book
to
him
a
black
book
covered
with
dust
and
began
to
rub
a
rusty
on
his
sword
which
was
not
rusty
now
he
said
opening
the
book
me
how
you
came
here
and
mind
you
speak
the
truth
speak
the
truth
said
philip
proudly
all
the
soldiers
rose
and
saluted
him
with
looks
of
deep
surprise
and
respect
nearly
always
said
philip
hot
to
the
ears
and
the
soldiers
clattered
stiffly
down
again
on
to
the
benches
laughing
once
more
philip
had
imagined
there
to
be
more
discipline
in
the
army
did
you
come
here
said
the
captain
the
great
bridge
staircase
said
philip
the
captain
wrote
busily
in
the
book
did
you
come
for
did
know
what
else
to
do
there
was
nothing
but
illimitable
prairie
and
so
i
came
up
are
a
very
bold
boy
said
the
captain
you
said
philip
do
to
be
was
your
purpose
in
coming
did
do
it
on
purpose
i
just
happened
to
come
the
captain
wrote
that
down
too
and
then
he
and
philip
and
the
soldiers
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
said
the
boy
said
the
captain
do
wish
said
the
boy
tell
me
what
you
meant
by
my
really
happening
after
all
and
then
i
wish
you
tell
me
the
way
home
do
you
want
to
get
to
asked
the
captain
said
philip
the
grange
ravelsham
sussex
know
it
said
the
captain
briefly
anyhow
you
ca
go
back
there
now
did
you
read
the
notice
at
the
top
of
the
ladder
trespassers
will
be
prosecuted
you
got
to
be
prosecuted
before
you
can
go
back
anywhere
rather
be
persecuted
than
go
down
that
ladder
again
he
said
suppose
it
wo
be
very
bad
being
persecuted
i
mean
his
idea
of
persecution
was
derived
from
books
he
thought
it
to
be
something
vaguely
unpleasant
from
which
one
escaped
in
disguise
adventurous
and
always
successful
for
the
judges
to
decide
said
the
captain
a
serious
thing
trespassing
in
our
city
this
guard
is
put
here
expressly
to
prevent
it
you
have
many
trespassers
philip
asked
the
captain
seemed
kind
and
philip
had
a
who
was
a
judge
so
the
word
judges
made
him
think
of
tips
and
good
advice
rather
than
of
justice
and
punishment
trespassers
indeed
the
captain
almost
snorted
his
answer
just
it
there
never
been
one
before
you
the
first
for
years
and
years
and
years
there
been
a
guard
here
because
when
the
town
was
first
built
the
astrologers
foretold
that
some
day
there
would
be
a
trespasser
who
would
do
untold
mischief
so
it
our
privilege
we
the
polistopolitan
guards
to
keep
watch
over
the
only
way
by
which
a
trespasser
could
come
in
i
sit
down
said
philip
suddenly
and
the
soldiers
made
room
for
him
on
the
bench
father
and
my
grandfather
and
all
my
ancestors
were
in
the
guards
said
the
captain
proudly
a
very
great
honour
wonder
said
philip
you
do
cut
off
the
end
of
your
ladder
the
top
end
i
mean
then
nobody
could
come
up
would
never
do
said
the
captain
you
see
another
prophecy
the
great
deliverer
is
to
come
that
way
i
suggested
philip
shyly
i
be
the
deliverer
instead
of
the
trespasser
i
much
rather
you
know
daresay
you
would
said
the
captain
people
ca
be
deliverers
just
because
they
much
rather
you
know
is
any
one
to
come
up
the
ladder
bridge
except
just
those
two
do
know
that
just
it
you
know
what
prophecies
are
afraid
i
do
exactly
vague
and
mixed
up
i
mean
the
one
i
telling
you
about
goes
something
like
this
who
comes
up
the
ladder
stair
beware
beware
steely
eyes
and
copper
hair
strife
and
grief
and
pain
to
bear
all
come
up
the
ladder
stair
you
see
we
ca
tell
whether
that
means
one
person
or
a
lot
of
people
with
steely
eyes
and
copper
hair
hair
just
plain
said
philip
sister
says
so
and
my
eyes
are
blue
i
believe
ca
see
in
this
light
the
captain
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
looked
earnestly
in
the
boy
eyes
i
ca
see
the
other
prophecy
goes
from
down
and
down
and
very
far
down
the
king
shall
come
to
take
his
own
he
shall
deliver
the
magic
town
and
all
that
he
made
shall
be
his
own
beware
take
care
beware
prepare
the
king
shall
come
by
the
ladder
stair
jolly
said
philip
love
poetry
do
you
know
any
more
are
heaps
of
prophecies
of
course
said
the
captain
astrologers
must
do
to
earn
their
pay
there
rather
a
nice
one
every
night
when
the
bright
stars
blink
the
guards
shall
turn
out
and
have
a
drink
as
the
clock
strikes
two
and
every
night
when
no
stars
are
seen
the
guards
shall
drink
in
their
own
canteen
when
the
clock
strikes
two
there
are
any
stars
so
we
have
the
drinks
served
here
less
trouble
than
going
across
the
square
to
the
canteen
and
the
principle
the
same
principle
is
the
great
thing
with
a
prophecy
my
boy
said
philip
and
then
the
bell
beat
again
one
two
and
outside
was
a
light
patter
of
feet
a
soldier
rose
saluted
his
officer
and
threw
open
the
door
there
was
a
moment
pause
philip
expected
some
one
to
come
in
with
a
tray
and
glasses
as
they
did
at
his
when
gentlemen
were
suddenly
thirsty
at
times
that
were
not
but
instead
after
a
moment
pause
a
dozen
greyhounds
stepped
daintily
in
on
their
padded
feet
and
round
the
neck
of
each
dog
was
slung
a
roundish
thing
that
looked
like
one
of
the
little
barrels
which
bernard
dogs
wear
round
their
necks
in
the
pictures
and
when
these
were
loosened
and
laid
on
the
table
philip
was
charmed
to
see
that
the
roundish
things
were
not
barrels
but
the
soldiers
reached
down
some
pewter
pots
from
a
high
shelf
pierced
the
with
their
bayonets
and
poured
out
the
milk
they
all
had
drinks
so
the
prophecy
came
true
and
what
is
more
they
gave
philip
a
drink
as
well
it
was
delicious
and
there
was
as
much
of
it
as
he
wanted
i
have
never
had
as
much
milk
as
i
wanted
have
you
then
the
hollow
were
tied
on
to
the
dogs
necks
again
and
out
they
went
slim
and
beautiful
two
by
two
wagging
their
slender
tails
in
the
most
amiable
and
orderly
way
take
the
to
the
town
kitchen
said
the
captain
be
made
into
ice
for
the
army
breakfast
waste
not
want
not
you
know
we
do
waste
anything
here
my
boy
philip
had
quite
got
over
his
snubbing
he
now
felt
that
the
captain
was
talking
with
him
as
man
to
man
helen
had
gone
away
and
left
him
well
he
was
learning
to
do
without
helen
and
he
had
got
away
from
the
grange
and
lucy
and
that
nurse
he
was
a
man
among
men
and
then
just
as
he
was
feeling
most
manly
and
important
and
quite
equal
to
facing
any
number
of
judges
there
came
a
little
tap
at
the
door
of
the
and
a
very
little
voice
said
do
please
let
me
come
in
then
the
door
opened
slowly
come
in
whoever
you
are
said
the
captain
and
the
person
who
came
in
was
lucy
lucy
whom
philip
thought
he
had
got
rid
of
lucy
who
stood
for
the
new
hateful
life
to
which
helen
had
left
him
lucy
in
her
serge
skirt
and
jersey
with
her
little
sleek
fair
and
that
anxious
smile
of
hers
philip
was
furious
it
was
too
bad
who
is
this
the
captain
was
saying
kindly
me
it
lucy
she
said
came
up
with
she
pointed
to
philip
manners
thought
philip
in
bitterness
you
did
he
said
shortly
did
i
was
close
behind
you
when
you
were
climbing
the
ladder
bridge
and
i
been
waiting
alone
ever
since
when
you
were
asleep
and
all
i
he
be
cross
when
he
knew
i
come
she
explained
to
the
soldiers
cross
said
philip
very
crossly
indeed
but
the
captain
signed
to
him
to
be
silent
then
lucy
was
questioned
and
her
answers
written
in
the
book
and
when
that
was
done
the
captain
said
this
little
girl
is
a
friend
of
yours
she
is
said
philip
violently
not
my
friend
and
she
never
will
be
i
seen
her
that
all
and
i
do
want
to
see
her
again
unkind
said
lucy
and
then
there
was
a
grave
silence
most
unpleasant
to
philip
the
soldiers
he
perceived
now
looked
coldly
at
him
it
was
all
fault
what
did
she
want
to
come
shoving
in
for
spoiling
everything
any
one
but
a
girl
would
have
known
that
a
was
the
right
place
for
a
girl
he
frowned
and
said
nothing
lucy
had
smuggled
up
against
the
captain
knee
and
he
was
stroking
her
hair
little
woman
he
said
must
go
to
sleep
now
so
as
to
be
rested
before
you
go
to
the
hall
of
justice
in
the
morning
they
made
lucy
a
bed
of
soldiers
cloaks
laid
on
a
bench
and
bearskins
are
the
best
of
pillows
philip
had
a
soldier
cloak
and
a
bench
and
a
bearskin
too
but
what
was
the
good
everything
was
spoiled
if
lucy
had
not
come
the
as
a
would
have
been
almost
as
good
as
the
tented
field
but
she
come
and
the
was
no
better
now
than
any
old
and
how
had
she
known
how
had
she
come
how
had
she
made
her
way
to
that
illimitable
prairie
where
he
had
found
the
mysterious
beginning
of
the
ladder
bridge
he
went
to
sleep
a
lump
of
prickly
discontent
and
suppressed
fury
when
he
woke
it
was
bright
daylight
and
a
soldier
was
saying
up
trespassers
breakfast
jolly
thought
philip
be
having
military
breakfast
then
he
remembered
lucy
and
hated
her
being
there
and
felt
once
more
that
she
had
spoiled
everything
i
should
not
myself
care
for
a
breakfast
of
ice
peppermint
creams
apples
bread
and
butter
and
sweet
milk
but
the
soldiers
seemed
to
enjoy
it
and
it
would
have
exactly
suited
philip
if
he
had
not
seen
that
lucy
was
enjoying
it
too
do
hate
greedy
girls
he
told
himself
for
he
was
now
in
that
state
of
black
rage
when
you
hate
everything
the
person
you
are
angry
with
does
or
says
or
is
and
now
it
was
time
to
start
for
the
hall
of
justice
the
guard
formed
outside
and
philip
noticed
that
each
soldier
stood
on
a
sort
of
green
mat
when
the
order
to
march
was
given
each
soldier
quickly
and
expertly
rolled
up
his
green
mat
and
put
it
under
his
arm
and
whenever
they
stopped
because
of
the
crowd
each
soldier
unrolled
his
green
mat
and
stood
on
it
till
it
was
time
to
go
on
again
and
they
had
to
stop
several
times
for
the
crowd
was
very
thick
in
the
great
squares
and
in
the
narrow
streets
of
the
city
it
was
a
wonderful
crowd
there
were
men
and
women
and
children
in
every
sort
of
dress
italian
spanish
russian
french
peasants
in
blue
blouses
and
wooden
shoes
workmen
in
the
dress
english
working
people
wore
a
hundred
years
ago
norwegians
swedes
swiss
turks
greeks
indians
arabians
chinese
japanese
besides
red
indians
in
dresses
of
skins
and
scots
in
kilts
and
sporrans
philip
did
not
know
what
nation
most
of
the
dresses
belonged
to
to
him
it
was
a
brilliant
patchwork
of
gold
and
gay
colours
it
reminded
him
of
the
party
he
had
once
been
to
with
helen
when
he
wore
a
pierrot
dress
and
felt
very
silly
in
it
he
noticed
that
not
a
single
boy
in
all
that
crowd
was
dressed
as
he
was
in
what
he
thought
was
the
only
correct
dress
for
boys
lucy
walked
beside
him
once
just
after
they
started
she
said
you
frightened
philip
and
he
would
not
answer
though
he
longed
to
say
course
not
it
only
girls
who
are
afraid
but
he
thought
it
would
be
more
disagreeable
to
say
nothing
so
he
said
it
when
they
got
to
the
hall
of
justice
she
caught
hold
of
his
hand
and
said
very
loud
and
sudden
it
remind
you
of
anything
she
asked
philip
pulled
his
hand
away
and
said
before
he
remembered
that
he
had
decided
not
to
speak
to
her
and
the
was
quite
untrue
for
the
building
did
remind
him
of
something
though
he
could
have
told
you
what
the
prisoners
and
their
guard
passed
through
a
great
arch
between
magnificent
silver
pillars
and
along
a
vast
corridor
lined
with
soldiers
who
all
saluted
all
sorts
of
soldiers
salute
you
he
asked
the
captain
only
just
your
own
ones
they
saluting
the
captain
said
laws
tell
us
to
salute
all
prisoners
out
of
respect
for
their
misfortunes
the
judge
sat
on
a
high
bronze
throne
with
colossal
bronze
dragons
on
each
side
of
it
and
wide
shallow
steps
of
ivory
black
and
white
two
attendants
spread
a
round
mat
on
the
top
of
the
steps
in
front
of
the
judge
a
yellow
mat
it
was
and
very
thick
and
he
stood
up
and
saluted
the
prisoners
of
your
misfortunes
the
captain
whispered
the
judge
wore
a
bright
yellow
robe
with
a
green
girdle
and
he
had
no
wig
but
a
very
hat
which
he
kept
on
all
the
time
the
trial
did
not
last
long
and
the
captain
said
very
little
and
the
judge
still
less
while
the
prisoners
were
not
allowed
to
speak
at
all
the
judge
looked
up
something
in
a
book
and
consulted
in
a
low
voice
with
the
crown
lawyer
and
a
person
in
black
then
he
put
on
his
spectacles
and
said
at
the
bar
you
are
found
guilty
of
trespass
the
punishment
is
death
if
the
judge
does
not
like
the
prisoners
if
he
does
not
dislike
them
it
is
imprisonment
for
life
or
until
the
judge
has
had
time
to
think
it
over
remove
the
prisoners
cried
philip
almost
weeping
thought
you
were
afraid
whispered
lucy
in
court
said
the
judge
then
philip
and
lucy
were
removed
they
were
marched
by
streets
quite
different
from
those
they
had
come
by
and
at
last
in
the
corner
of
a
square
they
came
to
a
large
house
that
was
quite
black
we
are
said
the
captain
kindly
better
luck
next
time
the
gaoler
a
gentleman
in
black
velvet
with
a
ruff
and
a
pointed
beard
came
out
and
welcomed
them
cordially
do
you
do
my
dears
he
said
hope
you
be
comfortable
here
misdemeanants
i
suppose
he
asked
course
said
the
captain
floor
if
you
please
said
the
gaoler
politely
and
stood
back
to
let
the
children
pass
to
the
left
and
up
the
stairs
illustration
floor
if
you
please
said
the
gaoler
politely
the
stairs
were
dark
and
went
on
and
on
and
round
and
round
and
up
and
up
at
the
very
top
was
a
big
room
simply
furnished
with
a
table
chairs
and
a
who
wants
more
furniture
than
that
got
the
best
view
in
the
whole
city
said
the
gaoler
you
be
company
for
me
what
they
gave
me
the
post
of
gaoler
because
it
nice
light
gentlemanly
work
and
leaves
me
time
for
my
writing
i
a
literary
man
you
know
but
i
sometimes
found
it
a
trifle
lonely
you
the
first
prisoners
i
ever
had
you
see
if
excuse
me
i
go
and
order
some
dinner
for
you
you
be
contented
with
the
feast
of
reason
and
the
flow
of
soul
i
feel
certain
the
moment
the
door
had
closed
on
the
gaoler
black
back
philip
turned
on
lucy
hope
you
satisfied
he
said
bitterly
is
all
doing
they
have
let
me
off
if
you
had
been
here
what
on
earth
did
you
want
to
come
here
for
why
did
you
come
running
after
me
like
that
you
know
i
do
like
you
the
hatefullest
disagreeablest
horridest
boy
in
all
the
world
said
lucy
firmly
philip
had
not
expected
this
he
met
it
as
well
as
he
could
not
a
little
sneak
of
a
white
mouse
squeezing
in
where
i
not
wanted
anyhow
he
said
and
then
they
stood
looking
at
each
other
breathing
quickly
both
of
them
rather
be
a
white
mouse
than
a
cruel
bully
said
lucy
at
last
not
a
bully
said
philip
then
there
was
another
silence
lucy
sniffed
philip
looked
round
the
bare
room
and
suddenly
it
came
to
him
that
he
and
lucy
were
companions
in
misfortune
no
matter
whose
fault
it
was
that
they
were
imprisoned
so
he
said
here
i
do
like
you
and
i
sha
pretend
i
do
but
i
call
it
pax
for
the
present
if
you
like
we
got
to
escape
from
this
place
somehow
and
i
help
you
if
you
like
and
you
may
help
me
if
you
can
you
said
lucy
in
a
tone
which
might
have
meant
anything
we
call
it
pax
and
see
if
we
can
escape
by
the
window
there
might
be
ivy
or
a
faithful
page
with
a
rope
ladder
have
you
a
page
at
the
grange
two
said
lucy
i
do
think
faithful
and
i
say
i
think
all
this
is
much
more
magic
than
you
think
course
i
know
it
magic
said
he
impatiently
it
quite
real
too
it
real
enough
said
she
they
leaned
out
of
the
window
alas
there
was
no
ivy
their
window
was
very
high
up
and
the
wall
outside
when
they
touched
it
with
their
hand
felt
smooth
as
glass
no
go
said
he
and
the
two
leaned
still
farther
out
of
the
window
looking
down
on
the
town
there
were
strong
towers
and
fine
minarets
and
palaces
the
palm
trees
and
fountains
and
gardens
a
white
building
across
the
square
looked
strangely
familiar
could
it
be
like
paul
which
philip
had
been
taken
to
see
when
he
was
very
little
and
which
he
had
never
been
able
to
remember
no
he
could
not
remember
it
even
now
the
two
prisoners
looked
out
in
a
long
silence
far
below
lay
the
city
its
trees
softly
waving
in
the
breeze
flowers
shining
in
a
bright
patchwork
the
canals
that
intersected
the
big
squares
gleamed
in
the
sunlight
and
crossing
and
recrossing
the
squares
and
streets
were
the
people
of
the
town
coming
and
going
about
their
business
here
said
lucy
suddenly
you
mean
to
say
you
do
know
what
he
asked
impatiently
we
are
what
it
is
do
you
no
more
do
you

seen
it
all
before
of
course
i
have
no
more

you
right

seen
it
before
though
said
lucy
so
have
you
but
i
sha
tell
you
what
it
is
unless
you
be
nice
to
me
her
tone
was
a
little
sad
but
quite
firm
nice
to
you
i
told
you
it
was
pax
said
philip
me
what
you
think
it
is
do
mean
that
sort
of
grandish
standoffish
pax
but
real
pax
oh
do
be
so
horrid
philip
i
dying
to
tell
you
but
i
wo
if
you
go
on
being
like
you
are
all
right
said
philip
with
it
you
got
to
say
it
pax
and
i
will
stand
by
you
till
we
get
out
of
this
and
i
always
act
like
a
noble
friend
to
you
and
i
try
my
best
to
like
you
of
course
if
you
ca
like
me
you
ca
but
you
ought
to
try
say
it
after
me
wo
you
her
tone
was
so
kind
and
persuading
that
he
found
himself
saying
after
her
philip
agree
to
try
and
like
you
lucy
and
to
stand
by
you
till
we
out
of
this
and
always
to
act
the
part
of
a
noble
friend
to
you
and
it
real
pax
shake
hands
then
said
he
when
they
had
shaken
hands
and
lucy
uttered
these
words
you
see
it
your
own
city
that
we
in
your
own
city
that
you
built
on
the
tables
in
the
it
all
got
big
by
magic
so
that
we
could
get
in
look
she
pointed
out
of
the
window
that
great
golden
dome
that
one
of
the
brass
and
that
white
building
my
old
model
of
paul
and
there
buckingham
palace
over
there
with
the
carved
squirrel
on
the
top
and
the
chessmen
and
the
blue
and
white
china
and
the
building
we
in
is
the
black
japanese
cabinet
philip
looked
and
he
saw
that
what
she
said
was
true
it
his
city
i
did
build
insides
to
my
buildings
said
he
when
did
see
what
i
built
anyway
insides
are
part
of
the
magic
i
suppose
lucy
said
i
saw
the
cities
you
built
when
auntie
brought
me
home
last
night
after
been
sent
to
bed
and
i
did
love
them
and
oh
philip
i
so
glad
pax
because
i
do
think
you
so
clever
and
auntie
thought
so
too
building
those
beautiful
things
and
i
knew
nurse
was
going
to
pull
it
all
down
i
begged
her
not
to
but
she
was
addymant
and
so
i
got
up
and
dressed
and
came
down
to
have
another
look
by
moonlight
and
one
or
two
of
the
bricks
and
chessmen
had
fallen
down
i
expect
nurse
knocked
them
down
so
i
built
them
up
again
as
well
as
i
could
and
i
was
loving
it
all
like
anything
and
then
the
door
opened
and
i
hid
under
the
table
and
you
came
in
you
were
there
did
you
notice
how
the
magic
began
but
it
all
changed
to
grass
and
then
i
saw
you
a
long
way
off
going
up
a
ladder
and
so
i
went
after
you
but
i
did
let
you
see
me
i
knew
you
be
so
cross
and
then
i
looked
in
at
the
door
and
i
did
so
want
some
of
the
milk
did
you
find
out
it
was
city
thought
the
soldiers
looked
like
my
lead
ones
somehow
but
i
sure
till
i
saw
the
judge
why
he
just
old
noah
out
of
the
ark
he
is
cried
philip
wonderful
how
perfectly
wonderful
i
wish
we
were
prisoners
would
it
be
jolly
to
go
all
over
it
into
all
the
buildings
to
see
what
the
insides
of
them
have
turned
into
and
all
the
other
people
i
did
put
in
more
magic
i
expect
but
oh
we
shall
find
it
all
out
in
time
she
clapped
her
hands
and
on
the
instant
the
door
opened
and
the
gaoler
appeared
visitor
for
you
he
said
and
stood
aside
to
let
some
one
else
come
in
some
one
tall
and
thin
with
a
black
hooded
cloak
and
a
black
such
as
people
wear
at
carnival
time
when
the
gaoler
had
shut
the
door
and
gone
away
the
tall
figure
took
off
its
mask
and
let
fall
its
cloak
showing
to
the
surprised
but
recognising
eyes
of
the
children
the
shape
of
noah
the
judge
do
you
do
he
said
is
a
little
unofficial
visit
i
hope
i
have
come
at
an
inconvenient
time
very
glad
said
lucy
you
can
tell
us
wo
answer
questions
said
noah
sitting
down
stiffly
on
his
yellow
mat
i
will
tell
you
something
we
do
know
who
you
are
but
i
myself
think
that
you
may
be
the
deliverer
of
us
said
philip
jealously
or
both
you
see
the
prophecy
says
that
the
destroyer
hair
is
red
and
your
hair
is
not
red
but
before
i
could
get
the
populace
to
feel
sure
of
that
my
own
hair
would
be
grey
with
thought
and
argument
some
people
are
so
and
i
am
not
used
to
thinking
i
often
have
to
do
it
it
distresses
me
the
children
said
they
were
sorry
philip
added
tell
us
a
little
about
your
city
it
is
a
question
we
want
to
know
if
it
magic
that
is
a
question
either
was
about
to
tell
you
said
noah
i
will
not
answer
questions
of
course
it
is
magic
everything
in
the
world
is
magic
until
you
understand
it
as
to
the
city
i
will
just
tell
you
a
little
of
our
history
many
thousand
years
ago
all
the
cities
of
our
country
were
built
by
a
great
and
powerful
giant
who
brought
the
materials
from
far
and
wide
the
place
was
peopled
partly
by
persons
of
his
choice
and
partly
by
a
sort
of
magic
rather
difficult
to
explain
as
soon
as
the
cities
were
built
and
the
inhabitants
placed
here
the
life
of
the
city
began
and
it
was
to
those
who
lived
it
as
though
it
had
always
been
the
artisans
toiled
the
musicians
played
and
the
poets
sang
the
astrologers
finding
themselves
in
a
tall
tower
evidently
designed
for
such
a
purpose
began
to
observe
the
stars
and
to
prophesy
know
that
part
said
philip
well
said
the
judge
you
know
quite
enough
now
i
want
to
ask
a
little
favour
of
you
both
would
you
mind
escaping
we
only
could
lucy
sighed
strain
on
my
nerves
is
too
much
said
noah
feelingly
my
dear
children
to
please
me
a
very
old
man
in
indifferent
health
and
poor
spirits
how
you
just
walk
out
you
my
boy
can
disguise
yourself
in
your
which
i
see
has
been
placed
on
yonder
chair
and
i
will
leave
my
cloak
for
you
little
girl
they
both
said
you
and
lucy
added
the
door
said
the
judge
is
a
rule
about
putting
prisoners
on
their
honour
not
to
escape
but
there
have
not
been
any
prisoners
for
so
long
that
i
do
suppose
they
put
you
on
honour
no
you
can
just
walk
out
of
the
door
there
are
many
charitable
persons
in
the
city
who
will
help
to
conceal
you
the
key
turns
easily
and
i
myself
will
oil
it
as
i
go
out
thank
you
so
much
for
falling
in
with
my
little
idea
accept
an
old
man
blessing
only
do
tell
the
gaoler
he
would
never
forgive
me
he
got
off
his
mat
rolled
it
up
and
went
said
lucy
said
philip
suppose
we
go
he
said
but
lucy
said
about
the
gaoler
he
catch
it
if
we
bolt
philip
felt
this
might
be
true
it
was
annoying
and
as
bad
as
being
put
on
one
honour
was
what
he
said
and
then
the
gaoler
came
in
he
looked
pale
and
worried
am
so
awfully
sorry
he
began
thought
i
should
enjoy
having
you
here
but
my
nerves
are
all
anyhow
the
very
sound
of
your
voices
i
ca
write
a
line
my
brain
reels
i
wonder
whether
you
be
good
enough
to
do
a
little
thing
for
me
would
you
mind
escaping
wo
you
get
into
trouble
could
be
worse
than
this
said
the
gaoler
with
feeling
had
no
idea
that
children
voices
were
so
penetrating
go
go
i
implore
you
to
escape
only
do
tell
the
judge
i
am
sure
he
would
never
forgive
me
after
that
what
prisoner
would
not
immediately
have
escaped
the
two
children
only
waited
till
the
sound
of
the
gaoler
keys
had
died
away
on
the
stairs
to
open
their
door
run
down
the
many
steps
and
slip
out
of
the
prison
gate
they
walked
a
little
way
in
silence
there
were
plenty
of
people
about
but
no
one
seemed
to
notice
them
way
shall
we
go
lucy
asked
wish
we
asked
him
where
the
charitables
live
think
philip
began
but
lucy
was
not
destined
to
know
what
he
thought
there
was
a
sudden
shout
a
clattering
of
horses
hoofs
and
all
the
faces
in
the
square
turned
their
way
seen
us
cried
philip
run
run
he
himself
ran
and
he
ran
toward
the
that
stood
at
the
top
of
the
ladder
stairs
by
which
they
had
come
up
and
behind
him
came
the
shouting
and
clatter
of
hot
pursuit
the
captain
stood
in
the
gateway
alone
and
just
as
philip
reached
the
gate
the
captain
turned
into
the
and
pretended
not
to
see
anything
philip
had
never
run
so
far
or
so
fast
his
breath
came
in
deep
sobs
but
he
reached
the
ladder
and
began
quickly
to
go
down
it
was
easier
than
going
up
illustration
and
behind
him
the
clatter
of
hot
pursuit
he
was
nearly
at
the
bottom
when
the
whole
ladder
bridge
leapt
wildly
into
the
air
and
he
fell
from
it
and
rolled
in
the
thick
grass
of
that
illimitable
prairie
all
about
him
the
air
was
filled
with
great
sounds
like
the
noise
of
the
earthquakes
that
destroy
beautiful
big
palaces
and
factories
which
are
big
but
not
beautiful
it
was
deafening
it
was
endless
it
was
unbearable
yet
he
had
to
bear
that
and
more
and
now
he
felt
a
curious
swelling
sensation
in
his
hands
then
in
his
head
then
all
over
it
was
extremely
painful
he
rolled
over
in
his
agony
and
saw
the
foot
of
an
enormous
giant
quite
close
to
him
the
foot
had
a
large
flat
ugly
shoe
and
seemed
to
come
out
of
grey
swaying
curtains
there
was
a
gigantic
column
too
black
against
the
grey
the
ladder
bridge
cast
down
lay
on
the
ground
not
far
from
him
pain
and
fear
overcame
philip
and
he
ceased
to
hear
or
feel
or
know
anything
when
he
recovered
consciousness
he
found
himself
under
the
table
in
the
the
swelling
feeling
was
over
and
he
did
not
seem
to
be
more
than
his
proper
size
he
could
see
the
flat
feet
of
the
nurse
and
the
lower
part
of
her
grey
skirt
and
a
rattling
and
rumbling
on
the
table
above
told
him
that
she
was
doing
as
she
had
said
she
would
and
destroying
his
city
he
saw
also
a
black
column
which
was
the
leg
of
the
table
every
now
and
then
the
nurse
walked
away
to
put
back
into
its
proper
place
something
he
had
used
in
the
building
and
once
she
stood
on
a
chair
and
he
heard
the
tinkling
of
the
as
she
hooked
them
into
their
places
on
the
chandelier
i
lie
very
still
said
he
she
wo
see
me
but
i
do
wonder
how
i
got
here
and
what
a
dream
to
tell
helen
about
he
lay
very
still
the
nurse
did
not
see
him
and
when
she
had
gone
to
her
breakfast
philip
crawled
out
yes
the
city
was
gone
not
a
trace
of
it
the
very
tables
were
back
in
their
proper
places
philip
went
back
to
his
proper
place
which
of
course
was
bed
a
splendid
dream
he
said
as
he
cuddled
down
between
the
sheets
now
it
all
over
of
course
he
was
quite
wrong
chapter
iii
lost
philip
went
to
sleep
and
dreamed
that
he
was
at
home
again
and
that
helen
had
come
to
his
bedside
to
call
him
leading
a
white
pony
that
was
to
be
his
very
own
it
was
a
pony
that
looked
clever
enough
for
anything
and
he
was
not
surprised
when
it
shook
hands
with
him
but
when
it
said
we
must
be
moving
and
began
to
try
to
put
on
philip
shoes
and
stockings
philip
called
out
i
say
stop
that
and
awoke
to
a
room
full
of
sunshine
but
empty
of
ponies
well
said
philip
suppose
i
better
get
up
he
looked
at
his
new
silver
watch
one
of
helen
parting
presents
and
saw
that
it
marked
ten
say
you
know
said
he
to
the
watch
ca
be
right
and
he
shook
it
to
encourage
it
to
think
over
the
matter
but
the
watch
still
said
quite
plainly
and
unmistakably
now
the
grange
breakfast
time
was
at
eight
and
philip
was
certain
he
had
not
been
called
is
jolly
rum
he
remarked
must
be
the
watch
perhaps
stopped
but
it
had
stopped
therefore
it
must
be
two
hours
past
breakfast
time
the
moment
he
had
thought
this
he
became
extremely
hungry
he
got
out
of
bed
as
soon
as
he
knew
exactly
how
hungry
he
was
there
was
no
one
about
so
he
made
his
way
to
the
and
spent
a
happy
hour
with
the
hot
water
and
the
cold
water
and
the
brown
windsor
soap
and
the
shaving
soap
and
the
nail
brush
and
the
flesh
brush
and
the
loofahs
and
the
shower
bath
and
the
three
sponges
he
had
not
so
far
been
able
thoroughly
to
investigate
and
enjoy
all
these
things
but
now
there
was
no
one
to
interfere
and
he
enjoyed
himself
to
that
degree
that
he
quite
forgot
to
wonder
why
he
had
been
called
he
thought
of
a
piece
of
poetry
that
helen
had
made
for
him
about
the
bath
and
when
he
had
done
playing
he
lay
on
his
back
in
water
that
was
very
hot
indeed
trying
to
remember
the
poetry
the
water
was
very
nearly
cold
by
the
time
he
had
remembered
the
poetry
it
was
called
dreams
of
a
giant
life
and
this
was
it
dreams
of
a
giant
life
what
was
i
once
in
ages
long
ago
i
look
back
and
i
see
myself
we
grow
so
changed
through
changing
years
i
hardly
see
how
that
which
i
look
back
on
could
be
me
glorious
and
splendid
i
stood
on
a
white
cliff
topped
by
a
darkling
wood
below
me
placid
bright
and
sparkling
lay
the
equal
waters
of
a
lovely
bay
white
cliffs
surrounded
it
and
calm
and
fair
it
lay
asleep
in
warm
and
silent
air
i
stood
alone
naked
and
strong
upright
my
limbs
gleamed
in
the
clear
pure
golden
light
i
saw
below
me
all
the
water
lie
expecting
something
and
that
thing
was
i
i
leaned
i
plunged
the
waves
splashed
over
me
i
lay
a
giant
in
a
little
sea
white
cliffs
all
round
and
as
i
lay
i
saw
the
glories
of
the
dying
day
no
wind
disturbed
my
sea
the
sunlight
was
as
though
it
came
through
windows
of
gold
glass
the
white
cliffs
rose
above
me
and
around
the
clear
sea
lay
pure
perfect
and
profound
and
i
was
master
of
the
cliffs
the
sea
and
the
gold
light
that
brightened
over
me
far
miles
away
my
giant
feet
showed
plain
rising
like
rocks
out
of
the
quiet
main
on
them
a
lighthouse
could
be
built
to
show
wayfaring
ships
the
way
they
must
not
go
i
was
the
master
of
that
sea
i
splashed
my
hands
the
waves
went
over
me
and
in
the
dimples
of
my
body
lay
little
where
small
might
play
i
found
a
boat
its
deck
was
perforate
i
launched
it
and
it
dared
the
storms
of
fate
its
woollen
sail
stood
out
against
the
sky
supported
by
a
mast
of
ivory
another
boat
rode
proudly
to
my
hand
upon
its
deck
a
thousand
spears
did
stand
i
launched
it
and
it
sped
full
fierce
and
fast
against
the
boat
that
had
the
ivory
mast
and
woollen
sail
and
perforated
deck
the
two
went
down
in
one
stupendous
wreck
beneath
the
waves
i
chased
with
joyous
hand
upon
the
bed
of
an
imagined
sand
the
slippery
brown
sea
mouse
that
still
escaped
where
the
deep
cave
beneath
my
knee
was
shaped
caught
it
at
last
and
caged
it
into
rest
upon
the
shallows
of
my
submerged
breast
then
as
i
lay
wrapped
as
in
some
kind
arm
by
the
sweet
world
of
waters
soft
and
warm
a
great
voice
cried
from
some
far
unseen
shore
and
i
was
not
a
giant
any
more
out
come
out
cried
out
the
voice
of
power
been
in
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
water
cold
come
master
pip
your
head
all
wet
and
it
is
time
you
were
in
bed
i
rose
all
dripping
from
the
magic
sea
and
left
the
ships
that
had
been
slaves
to
me
the
with
its
perforated
deck
the
that
had
rushed
to
loss
and
wreck
the
flannel
sail
the
that
was
mast
the
sleek
i
left
them
all
at
last
i
went
out
of
that
magic
sea
and
cried
because
the
time
came
when
i
must
be
dried
and
leave
the
splendour
of
a
giant
joy
and
go
to
bed
a
little
boy
footnotes
never
mind
grammar
this
is
correct
grammar
but
never
mind
when
he
had
quite
remembered
the
poetry
he
had
another
and
then
when
he
had
enjoyed
the
hot
rough
towels
out
of
the
hot
cupboard
he
went
back
to
his
room
to
dress
he
now
felt
how
deeply
he
wanted
his
breakfast
so
he
dressed
himself
with
all
possible
speed
even
forgetting
to
fasten
his
bootlaces
properly
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
that
he
dropped
his
and
it
was
as
he
stooped
to
pick
it
up
that
he
remembered
his
dream
do
you
know
that
was
really
the
first
time
he
had
thought
of
it
the
dream
that
indeed
would
be
something
to
think
about
breakfast
was
the
really
important
thing
he
went
down
very
hungry
indeed
shall
ask
for
my
breakfast
directly
i
get
down
he
said
shall
ask
the
first
person
i
meet
and
he
met
no
one
there
was
no
one
on
the
stairs
or
in
the
hall
or
in
the
or
in
the
the
library
and
were
empty
of
living
people
and
the
door
of
the
nursery
was
locked
so
then
philip
made
his
way
into
the
regions
beyond
the
baize
door
where
the
quarters
were
and
there
was
no
one
in
the
kitchen
or
in
the
hall
or
in
the
butler
pantry
or
in
the
scullery
or
the
washhouse
or
the
larder
in
all
that
big
house
and
it
was
much
bigger
than
it
looked
from
the
front
because
of
the
long
wings
that
ran
out
on
each
side
of
its
back
in
all
that
big
house
there
was
no
one
but
philip
he
felt
certain
of
this
before
he
ran
upstairs
and
looked
in
all
the
bedrooms
and
in
the
little
picture
gallery
and
the
and
then
in
the
servants
bedrooms
and
the
very
attics
there
were
interesting
things
in
those
attics
but
philip
only
remembered
that
afterwards
now
he
tore
down
the
stairs
three
at
a
time
all
the
room
doors
were
open
as
he
had
left
them
and
somehow
those
open
doors
frightened
him
more
than
anything
else
he
ran
along
the
corridors
down
more
stairs
past
more
open
doors
and
out
through
the
back
kitchen
along
the
walk
by
the
brick
wall
and
so
round
by
the
three
yew
trees
and
the
mounting
block
to
the
and
there
was
no
one
there
neither
coachman
nor
groom
nor
and
there
was
no
one
in
the
stables
or
the
or
the
or
the
loft
philip
felt
that
he
could
not
go
back
into
the
house
something
terrible
must
have
happened
was
it
possible
that
any
one
could
want
the
grange
servants
enough
to
kidnap
them
philip
thought
of
the
nurse
and
felt
that
at
least
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
it
was
possible
or
perhaps
it
was
magic
a
sort
of
happening
only
every
one
had
vanished
instead
of
just
being
put
to
sleep
for
a
hundred
years
he
was
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
when
the
thought
came
to
him
they
only
made
invisible
perhaps
they
all
here
and
watching
me
and
making
fun
of
me
he
stood
still
to
think
this
it
was
not
a
pleasant
thought
suddenly
he
straightened
his
little
back
and
threw
back
his
head
sha
see
i
frightened
anyway
he
told
himself
and
then
he
remembered
the
larder
have
had
any
breakfast
he
explained
aloud
so
as
to
be
plainly
heard
by
any
invisible
people
who
might
be
about
ought
to
have
my
breakfast
if
nobody
gives
it
to
me
i
shall
take
my
breakfast
he
waited
for
an
answer
but
none
came
it
was
very
quiet
in
the
only
the
rattle
of
a
halter
ring
against
a
manger
the
sound
of
a
hoof
on
stable
stones
the
cooing
of
pigeons
and
the
rustle
of
straw
in
the
broke
the
silence
well
said
philip
do
know
what
think
i
ought
to
have
for
breakfast
so
i
shall
take
what
think
he
drew
a
long
breath
trying
to
draw
courage
in
with
it
threw
back
his
shoulders
more
soldierly
than
ever
and
marched
in
through
the
back
door
and
straight
to
the
larder
then
he
took
what
he
thought
he
ought
to
have
for
breakfast
this
is
what
he
thought
cherry
pie
custards
in
cups
cold
sausage
pieces
of
cold
toast
piece
of
cheese
lemon
small
jam
tart
there
was
only
one
left
butter
pat
jolly
things
the
servants
have
to
eat
he
said
never
knew
i
thought
that
nothing
but
mutton
and
rice
grew
here
he
put
all
the
food
on
a
silver
tray
and
carried
it
out
on
to
the
terrace
which
lies
between
the
two
wings
at
the
back
of
the
house
then
he
went
back
for
milk
but
there
was
none
to
be
seen
so
he
got
a
white
jug
full
of
water
the
spoons
he
could
find
but
he
found
a
and
a
did
you
ever
try
to
eat
cherry
pie
with
a
happened
said
philip
to
himself
through
the
cherry
pie
whatever
happens
it
as
well
to
have
had
your
breakfast
and
he
bit
a
generous
inch
off
the
cold
sausage
which
he
had
speared
with
the
and
now
sitting
out
in
the
good
sunshine
and
growing
less
and
less
hungry
as
he
plied
and
his
mind
went
back
to
his
dream
which
began
to
seem
more
and
more
real
suppose
it
really
happened
it
might
have
magic
things
did
happen
it
seemed
look
how
all
the
people
had
vanished
out
of
the
house
out
of
the
world
too
perhaps
every
one
vanished
said
philip
i
the
only
person
left
in
the
world
who
has
vanished
then
everything
in
the
world
would
belong
to
me
then
i
could
have
everything
that
in
all
the
toy
shops
and
his
mind
for
a
moment
dwelt
fondly
on
this
beautiful
idea
then
he
went
on
suppose
i
vanished
too
perhaps
if
i
were
to
vanish
i
could
see
the
other
people
who
have
i
wonder
how
it
done
he
held
his
breath
and
tried
hard
to
vanish
have
you
ever
tried
this
it
is
not
at
all
easy
to
do
philip
could
not
do
it
at
all
he
held
his
breath
and
he
tried
and
he
tried
but
he
only
felt
fatter
and
fatter
and
more
and
more
as
though
in
one
more
moment
he
should
burst
so
he
let
his
breath
go
he
said
looking
at
his
hands
not
any
more
invisible
than
i
was
before
not
so
much
i
think
he
added
thoughtfully
looking
at
what
was
left
of
the
cherry
pie
that
dream
he
plunged
deep
in
the
remembrance
of
it
that
was
to
him
like
swimming
in
the
waters
of
a
fairy
lake
he
was
hooked
out
of
his
lake
suddenly
by
voices
it
was
like
waking
up
there
away
across
the
green
park
beyond
the
sunk
fence
were
people
coming
every
one
has
vanished
he
said
caught
up
the
tray
and
took
it
in
he
hid
it
under
the
pantry
shelf
he
did
know
who
the
people
were
who
were
coming
and
you
ca
be
too
careful
then
he
went
out
and
made
himself
small
in
the
shadow
of
a
red
buttress
heard
their
voices
coming
nearer
and
nearer
they
were
all
talking
at
once
in
that
quick
interested
way
that
makes
you
certain
something
unusual
has
happened
he
could
not
hear
exactly
what
they
were
saying
but
he
caught
the
words
course
i
asked
of
course
make
quite
sure
then
every
one
began
speaking
all
at
once
and
you
could
not
hear
anything
that
anybody
said
philip
was
too
busy
keeping
behind
the
buttress
to
see
who
they
were
who
were
talking
he
was
glad
had
happened
i
shall
have
something
to
think
about
besides
the
nurse
and
my
beautiful
city
that
she
has
pulled
down
but
what
was
it
that
had
happened
he
hoped
nobody
was
hurt
or
had
done
anything
wrong
the
word
police
had
always
made
him
uncomfortable
ever
since
he
had
seen
a
boy
no
bigger
than
himself
pulled
along
the
road
by
a
very
large
policeman
the
boy
had
stolen
a
loaf
philip
was
told
philip
could
never
forget
that
boy
face
he
always
thought
of
it
in
church
when
it
said
and
captives
and
still
more
when
it
said
and
oppressed
do
hope
it
not
he
said
and
slowly
he
got
himself
to
leave
the
shelter
of
the
buttress
and
to
follow
to
the
house
those
voices
and
those
footsteps
that
had
gone
by
him
he
followed
the
sound
of
them
to
the
kitchen
the
cook
was
there
in
tears
and
a
windsor
the
kitchenmaid
her
cap
all
on
one
side
was
crying
down
most
dirty
cheeks
the
coachman
was
there
very
red
in
the
face
and
the
groom
without
his
gaiters
the
nurse
was
there
neat
as
ever
she
seemed
at
first
but
philip
was
delighted
when
a
more
careful
inspection
showed
him
that
there
was
mud
on
her
large
shoes
and
on
the
bottom
of
her
skirt
and
that
her
dress
had
a
large
tear
in
it
would
have
had
it
happen
for
a
note
the
coachman
was
saying
said
the
nurse
to
the
groom
go
and
get
a
horse
ready
i
write
the
telegram
best
take
peppermint
said
the
coachman
the
fastest
the
groom
went
out
saying
under
his
breath
your
grandmother
which
philip
thought
rude
and
unmeaning
philip
was
standing
unnoticed
by
the
door
he
felt
that
thrill
if
it
is
pleasure
it
is
more
like
it
than
anything
else
which
we
all
feel
when
something
real
has
happened
but
what
happened
what
wish
i
never
come
back
said
the
nurse
nobody
could
pretend
it
was
fault
do
matter
what
they
pretend
the
cook
stopped
crying
to
say
thing
is
what
happened
oh
my
goodness
i
rather
have
been
turned
away
without
a
character
than
have
had
this
happen
i
rather
said
the
nurse
my
goodness
me
i
wish
i
never
been
born
and
then
and
there
before
the
astonished
eyes
of
philip
she
began
to
behave
as
any
nice
person
might
she
began
to
cry
would
have
happened
said
the
cook
the
master
had
been
away
he
a
justice
of
the
peace
he
is
and
a
terror
to
gipsies
it
would
never
have
happened
if
philip
could
not
bear
it
any
longer
would
have
happened
if
he
asked
startling
everybody
to
a
quick
jump
of
surprise
the
nurse
stopped
crying
and
turned
to
look
at
him
she
said
slowly
forgot
you
want
your
breakfast
i
suppose
no
matter
what
happened
i
do
said
philip
with
extreme
truth
want
to
know
what
happened
lucy
lost
said
the
cook
heavily
what
happened
so
now
you
know
you
run
along
and
play
like
a
good
little
boy
and
make
extry
trouble
for
us
in
the
trouble
we
in
repeated
philip
lost
i
expect
you
glad
said
the
nurse
way
you
treated
her
you
hold
your
tongue
and
do
let
me
so
much
as
hear
you
breathe
the
next
hours
i
go
and
write
that
telegram
philip
thought
it
best
not
to
let
any
one
hear
him
breathe
by
this
means
he
heard
the
telegram
when
nurse
read
it
aloud
to
the
cook
graham
hotel
wagram
brussels
miss
lucy
lost
please
come
home
immediately
philkins
that
all
right
is
it
do
see
why
you
sign
it
philkins
you
only
the
nurse
i
the
head
of
the
house
when
the
family
away
and
my
name
bobson
the
cook
said
there
was
a
sound
of
torn
paper
the
paper
tore
i
just
as
soon
your
name
went
to
it
said
the
nurse
do
want
to
be
the
one
to
tell
such
news
my
good
gracious
what
a
thing
to
happen
sighed
the
cook
little
darling
then
somebody
wrote
the
telegram
again
and
the
nurse
took
it
out
to
the
where
peppermint
was
already
saddled
thought
said
philip
bold
in
the
nurse
absence
thought
lucy
was
with
her
aunt
came
back
yesterday
said
the
cook
after
you
gone
to
bed
and
this
morning
that
nurse
went
into
the
night
nursery
and
she
there
her
bed
all
empty
and
cold
and
her
clothes
gone
though
how
the
gipsies
could
have
got
in
without
waking
that
nurse
is
a
mystery
to
me
and
ever
will
be
she
must
sleep
like
a
pig
the
seven
sleepers
said
the
coachman
what
would
gipsies
want
her
philip
asked
do
they
ever
want
anybody
for
retorted
the
cook
at
the
heirs
that
been
stolen
i
do
suppose
there
a
titled
family
in
england
but
what
had
its
heir
stolen
one
time
and
another
suppose
you
looked
all
over
the
house
said
philip
suppose
we
ai
deaf
and
dumb
and
blind
and
silly
said
the
cook
that
nurse
you
be
off
philip
without
you
want
a
flea
in
your
ear
and
philip
at
the
word
off
he
went
into
the
long
and
shut
the
door
then
he
got
the
ivory
chessmen
out
of
the
buhl
cabinet
and
set
them
out
on
that
delightful
whose
chequers
are
of
and
ivory
and
tried
to
play
a
game
right
hand
against
left
but
right
hand
who
was
white
and
so
moved
first
always
won
he
gave
up
after
awhile
and
put
the
chessmen
away
in
their
proper
places
then
he
got
out
the
big
book
of
photographs
of
pictures
but
they
did
not
seem
interesting
so
he
tried
the
ivory
spellicans
but
his
hand
shook
and
you
know
spellicans
is
a
game
you
ca
play
when
your
hand
shakes
and
all
the
time
behind
the
chess
and
the
pictures
and
the
spellicans
he
was
trying
not
to
think
about
his
dream
about
how
he
had
climbed
that
ladder
stair
which
was
really
the
and
gone
into
the
cities
that
he
had
built
on
the
tables
somehow
he
did
not
want
to
remember
it
the
very
idea
of
remembering
made
him
feel
guilty
and
wretched
he
went
and
looked
out
of
the
window
and
as
he
stood
there
his
wish
not
to
remember
the
dream
made
his
boots
restless
and
in
their
shuffling
his
right
boot
kicked
against
something
hard
that
lay
in
the
folds
of
the
blue
brocade
curtain
he
looked
down
stooped
and
picked
up
little
noah
the
nurse
must
have
dropt
it
there
when
she
cleared
away
the
city
and
as
he
looked
upon
those
wooden
features
it
suddenly
became
impossible
not
to
think
of
the
dream
he
let
the
remembrance
of
it
come
and
it
came
in
a
flood
and
with
it
the
remembrance
of
what
he
had
done
he
had
promised
to
be
lucy
noble
friend
and
they
had
run
together
to
escape
from
the
galloping
soldiers
and
he
had
run
faster
than
she
and
at
the
top
of
the
ladder
the
ladder
of
safety
had
not
waited
for
old
hero
would
have
waited
for
her
and
let
her
go
first
he
told
himself
gentleman
would
even
any
let
alone
a
hero
and
i
just
bunked
down
the
ladder
and
forgot
her
i
her
there
remorse
stirred
his
boots
more
ungently
than
before
it
was
only
a
dream
he
said
and
then
remorse
said
as
he
had
felt
all
along
that
it
would
if
he
only
gave
it
a
chance
suppose
it
was
a
dream
suppose
it
was
real
suppose
you
leave
her
there
my
noble
friend
and
that
why
she
lost
suddenly
philip
felt
very
small
very
forlorn
very
much
alone
in
the
world
but
helen
would
come
back
that
telegram
would
bring
her
yes
and
he
would
have
to
tell
her
that
perhaps
it
was
his
fault
it
was
in
vain
that
philip
told
himself
that
helen
would
never
believe
about
the
city
he
felt
that
she
would
why
should
she
she
knew
about
the
fairy
tales
and
the
arabian
nights
and
she
would
know
that
these
things
happen
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
he
said
quite
loud
and
there
was
no
one
but
himself
to
give
the
answer
i
could
only
get
back
into
the
city
he
said
that
hateful
nurse
has
pulled
it
all
down
and
locked
up
the
nursery
so
i
ca
even
build
it
again
oh
what
i
do
and
with
that
he
began
to
cry
for
now
he
felt
quite
sure
that
the
dream
was
a
dream
that
he
really
got
into
the
magic
city
had
promised
to
stand
by
lucy
and
had
been
false
to
his
promise
and
to
her
he
rubbed
his
eyes
with
his
knuckles
and
also
rather
painfully
with
noah
whom
he
still
held
shall
i
do
he
sobbed
and
a
very
very
teeny
tiny
voice
said
me
said
philip
me
said
the
voice
again
it
was
such
a
teeny
tiny
voice
that
he
could
only
just
hear
it
it
was
unlikely
of
course
that
the
voice
could
have
been
noah
but
then
whose
else
could
it
be
on
the
bare
chance
that
it
have
been
noah
who
spoke
more
unlikely
things
had
happened
before
as
you
know
philip
set
the
little
wooden
figure
down
on
the
it
stood
there
wooden
as
ever
down
philip
asked
and
then
before
his
eyes
the
little
wooden
figure
grew
alive
stooped
to
pick
up
the
yellow
disc
of
wood
on
which
noah
ark
people
stand
rolled
it
up
like
a
mat
put
it
under
his
arm
and
began
to
walk
towards
the
side
of
the
table
where
philip
stood
he
knelt
down
to
bring
his
ears
nearer
the
little
live
moving
thing
did
you
say
he
asked
for
he
fancied
that
noah
had
again
spoken
said
what
the
matter
said
the
little
voice
lucy
she
lost
and
it
my
fault
and
i
can
only
just
hear
you
it
hurts
my
ears
hearing
you
complained
philip
an
in
a
box
on
the
middle
of
the
he
could
just
hear
the
teeny
tiny
voice
say
belonged
to
a
get
it
out
and
listen
through
philip
got
it
out
it
was
an
odd
curly
thing
and
at
first
he
could
not
be
sure
which
end
he
ought
to
put
to
his
ear
but
he
tried
both
ends
and
on
the
second
trial
he
heard
quite
a
loud
strong
big
voice
say
better
it
was
a
dream
last
night
said
philip
course
it
was
said
noah

is
lucy

city

difficult
i

those
cities
in
two
worlds

down
in

the
other
world

philip

for
ever
how
was

in
built
up
a
corner
of
your
city
that
the
nurse
had
knocked
down
illustration
he
heard
quite
a
loud
strong
big
voice
say
better
said
philip
more
and
more
bewildered
here
so
you
ca
be
there
i
there
said
noah

and
you
alive
here
what
made
you
come
alive

into
the
city
dangerous
do
care

glad
enough
to

away
said
noah

that
the
worst
of
it
said
philip
is
there
any
way
to
get
back
if
i
climbed
in
at
the
nursery
windows
and
got
the
bricks
and
built
it
all
up
and
unnecessary
i
assure
you
there
are
a
thousand
doors
to
that
city
wish
i
could
find
said
philip
i
say
i
thought
time
was
all
different
there
how
is
it
lucy
is
lost
all
this
time
if
time
does
count
does
count
now
said
noah
made
it
count
when
you
ran
away
and
left
lucy
that
set
the
clocks
of
the
city
to
the
time
of
this
world
do
understand
said
philip
it
does
matter
show
me
the
door
and
i
go
back
and
find
lucy
something
and
go
through
it
said
noah
all
your
tears
are
dry
on
me
now
and
he
laid
down
his
yellow
mat
stepped
on
to
it
and
was
just
a
little
wooden
figure
again
philip
dropped
the
and
looked
at
noah
understand
he
said
but
this
at
least
he
understood
that
helen
would
come
back
when
she
got
that
telegram
and
that
before
she
came
he
must
go
into
the
other
world
and
find
the
lost
lucy
oh
he
said
i
find
her
i
wish
i
had
built
those
cities
so
big
and
time
will
go
on
and
perhaps
when
helen
comes
back
she
find
lost
as
well
as
lucy
but
he
dried
his
eyes
and
told
himself
that
this
was
not
how
heroes
behaved
he
must
build
again
whichever
way
you
looked
at
it
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
and
besides
the
nurse
might
occur
at
any
moment
he
looked
round
for
building
materials
there
was
the
it
had
long
narrow
legs
set
round
it
rather
like
arches
something
might
be
done
with
it
with
books
and
candlesticks
and
japanese
vases
something
done
philip
built
with
earnest
care
but
also
with
considerable
speed
if
the
nurse
should
come
in
before
he
had
made
a
door
and
got
through
it
come
in
and
find
him
building
again
she
was
quite
capable
of
putting
him
to
bed
where
of
course
building
is
impossible
in
a
very
little
time
there
was
a
building
but
how
to
get
in
he
was
alas
the
wrong
size
he
stood
helpless
and
once
more
tears
pricked
and
swelled
behind
his
eyelids
one
tear
fell
on
his
hand
are
a
strong
magic
noah
had
said
and
at
the
thought
the
tears
stopped
still
there
a
tear
the
one
on
his
hand
he
rubbed
it
on
the
pillar
of
the
porch
and
instantly
a
queer
tight
thin
feeling
swept
through
him
he
felt
giddy
and
shut
his
eyes
his
boots
ever
sympathetic
shuffled
on
the
carpet
or
was
it
the
carpet
it
was
very
thick
and
he
opened
his
eyes
his
feet
were
once
more
on
the
long
grass
of
the
illimitable
prairie
and
in
front
of
him
towered
the
gigantic
porch
of
a
vast
building
and
a
domino
path
leading
up
to
it
i
am
so
glad
cried
philip
among
the
grass
could
have
borne
it
if
she
been
lost
for
ever
and
all
my
fault
the
gigantic
porch
lowered
frowningly
above
him
what
would
he
find
on
the
other
side
of
it
illustration
the
gigantic
porch
lowered
frowningly
above
him
do
care
i
simply
got
to
go
he
said
and
stepped
out
bravely
i
ca
a
hero
i
try
to
behave
like
one
and
with
that
he
stepped
out
stumbling
a
little
in
the
thick
grass
and
the
dark
shadow
of
the
porch
received
him
the
child
said
the
nurse
coming
into
the
a
little
later
he
has
been
at
his
precious
building
game
again
i
shall
have
to
give
him
a
lesson
over
this
i
can
see
that
and
i
will
too
a
lesson
he
wo
forget
in
a
hurry
she
went
through
the
house
looking
for
the
too
bold
builder
that
she
might
give
him
that
lesson
then
she
went
through
the
garden
still
on
the
same
errand
half
an
hour
later
she
burst
into
the
servants
hall
and
threw
herself
into
a
chair
do
care
what
happens
now
she
said
house
is
bewitched
i
think
i
shall
go
the
very
minute
i
had
my
dinner
up
now
the
cook
came
to
the
door
to
say
said
the
nurse
nothing
what
should
there
be
everything
all
right
and
beautiful
and
just
as
it
should
be
of
course
lucy
not
found
yet
of
course
but
that
all
is
it
and
enough
too
i
should
have
thought
said
the
nurse
as
it
happens
it
all
the
boy
lost
now
oh
i
not
joking
lost
i
tell
you
the
same
as
the
other
one
and
i
off
out
of
this
by
the
two
train
and
i
do
care
who
knows
it
said
the
cook
before
starting
for
the
two
train
the
nurse
went
back
to
the
to
destroy
philip
new
building
to
restore
to
their
proper
places
its
books
candlesticks
vases
and
chessmen
there
we
will
leave
her
chapter
iv
the
when
philip
walked
up
the
domino
path
and
under
the
vast
arch
into
the
darkness
beyond
his
heart
felt
strong
with
high
resolve
his
legs
however
felt
weak
strangely
weak
especially
about
the
knees
the
doorway
was
so
enormous
that
which
lay
beyond
was
so
dark
and
he
himself
so
very
very
small
as
he
passed
under
the
little
gateway
which
he
had
built
of
three
dominoes
with
the
little
silver
knight
in
armour
on
the
top
he
noticed
that
he
was
only
as
high
as
a
domino
and
you
know
how
very
little
that
is
philip
went
along
the
domino
path
he
had
to
walk
carefully
for
to
him
the
spots
on
the
dominoes
were
quite
deep
hollows
but
as
they
were
black
they
were
easy
to
see
he
had
made
three
arches
one
beyond
another
of
two
pairs
of
silver
candlesticks
with
silver
inkstands
on
the
top
of
them
the
third
pair
of
silver
candlesticks
had
a
book
on
the
top
of
them
because
there
were
no
more
inkstands
and
when
he
had
passed
through
the
three
silver
arches
he
stopped
beyond
lay
a
sort
of
velvety
darkness
with
white
gleams
in
it
and
as
his
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
darkness
he
saw
that
he
was
in
a
great
hall
of
silver
pillars
gigantic
silver
candlesticks
they
seemed
to
be
and
they
went
in
long
vistas
this
way
and
that
way
and
every
way
like
the
in
a
so
that
whichever
way
you
turned
a
long
pillared
corridor
lay
in
front
of
you
philip
had
no
idea
which
way
he
ought
to
go
it
seemed
most
unlikely
that
he
would
find
lucy
in
a
dark
hall
with
silver
pillars
the
same
he
said
not
so
dark
as
it
was
by
long
chalks
it
was
not
the
silver
pillars
had
begun
to
give
out
a
faint
soft
glow
like
the
silver
phosphorescence
that
lies
in
sea
pools
in
summer
time
lucky
too
he
said
of
the
holes
in
the
floor
the
holes
were
the
spots
on
the
dominoes
with
which
the
pillared
hall
was
paved
wonder
what
part
of
the
city
where
lucy
is
i
shall
come
out
at
philip
asked
himself
but
he
need
not
have
troubled
he
did
not
come
out
at
all
he
walked
on
and
on
and
on
and
on
and
on
he
thought
he
was
walking
straight
but
really
he
was
turning
first
this
way
and
then
that
and
then
the
other
way
among
the
avenues
of
silver
pillars
which
all
looked
just
alike
he
was
getting
very
tired
and
he
had
been
walking
a
long
time
before
he
came
to
anything
that
was
not
silver
pillars
and
velvet
black
under
invisible
roofs
and
floor
paved
with
dominoes
laid
very
close
together
i
am
glad
he
said
at
last
when
he
saw
the
pavement
narrow
to
a
single
line
of
dominoes
just
like
the
path
he
had
come
in
by
there
was
an
arch
too
like
the
arch
by
which
he
had
come
in
and
then
he
perceived
in
a
shock
of
miserable
surprise
that
it
was
in
fact
the
same
arch
and
the
same
domino
path
he
had
come
back
after
all
that
walking
to
the
point
from
which
he
had
started
it
was
most
mortifying
so
silly
philip
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
domino
path
to
rest
and
think
i
just
walk
out
and
do
believe
in
magic
any
more
he
said
to
himself
says
magic
can
only
happen
to
people
who
believe
in
magic
so
if
i
just
walked
out
and
did
believe
as
hard
as
ever
i
could
i
should
be
my
own
right
size
again
and
lucy
would
be
back
and
there
would
any
magic
illustration
he
walked
on
and
on
and
on
but
said
that
voice
that
always
would
come
and
join
in
whenever
philip
was
talking
to
himself
lucy
believe
it
then
it
all
go
on
for
her
whatever
believe
and
she
be
back
besides
you
know
you
to
believe
it
because
it
true
bother
said
philip
tired
i
do
want
to
go
on
should
have
deserted
lucy
said
the
tiresome
voice
you
would
have
had
to
go
back
to
look
for
her
i
ca
find
my
way
how
can
i
find
my
way
know
well
enough
fix
your
eyes
on
a
pillar
and
walk
straight
to
it
and
when
you
nearly
there
fix
your
eyes
a
little
farther
you
bound
to
come
out
somewhere
i
tired
and
it
so
lonely
said
philip
lonely
too
said
the
voice
it
said
philip
and
he
got
up
and
began
to
walk
again
also
he
took
the
advice
of
that
worrying
voice
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
a
distant
pillar
why
should
i
bother
he
said
is
a
sort
of
dream
if
it
a
dream
said
the
voice
are
adventures
in
it
so
you
may
as
well
be
adventurous
all
right
said
philip
and
on
he
went
and
by
walking
very
carefully
and
fixing
his
eyes
a
long
way
off
he
did
at
last
come
right
through
the
hall
of
silver
pillars
and
saw
beyond
the
faint
glow
of
the
pillars
the
blue
light
of
day
it
shone
very
brightly
through
a
very
little
door
and
when
philip
came
to
that
door
he
went
through
it
without
hesitation
and
there
he
was
in
a
big
field
it
was
rather
like
the
illimitable
prairie
only
there
were
great
patches
of
flowers
also
there
was
a
path
across
it
and
he
followed
the
path
he
said
more
likely
to
meet
lucy
girls
always
keep
to
paths
they
never
explore
which
just
shows
how
little
he
knew
about
girls
he
looked
back
after
a
while
to
see
what
the
hall
of
pillars
looked
like
from
outside
but
it
was
already
dim
in
the
mists
of
distance
but
ahead
of
him
he
saw
a
great
rough
building
rather
like
stonehenge
wish
i
come
into
the
other
city
where
the
people
are
and
the
soldiers
and
the
greyhounds
and
the
he
told
himself
nobody
here
at
all
not
even
lucy
the
loneliness
of
the
place
grew
more
and
more
unpleasing
to
philip
but
he
went
on
it
seemed
more
reasonable
than
to
go
back
ought
to
be
very
hungry
he
said
must
have
been
walking
for
hours
but
he
was
hungry
it
may
have
been
the
magic
or
it
may
have
been
the
odd
breakfast
he
had
had
i
do
know
he
spoke
aloud
because
it
was
so
quiet
in
that
strange
open
country
with
no
one
in
it
but
himself
and
no
sound
but
the
clump
clump
of
his
boots
on
the
path
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
everything
grew
quieter
and
quieter
till
he
could
almost
hear
himself
think
loneliness
real
loneliness
is
a
dreadful
thing
i
hope
you
will
never
feel
it
philip
looked
to
right
and
left
and
before
him
and
on
all
the
wide
plain
nothing
moved
there
were
the
grass
and
flowers
but
no
wind
stirred
them
and
there
was
no
sign
that
any
living
person
had
ever
trodden
that
path
except
that
there
a
path
to
tread
and
that
the
path
led
to
the
stonehenge
building
and
even
that
seemed
to
be
only
a
ruin
go
as
far
as
that
anyhow
said
philip
there
be
a
signboard
there
or
something
there
was
something
something
most
unexpected
philip
reached
the
building
it
was
really
very
like
stonehenge
only
the
pillars
were
taller
and
closer
together
and
there
was
one
high
solid
towering
wall
turned
the
corner
of
a
massive
upright
and
ran
almost
into
the
arms
and
quite
on
to
the
feet
of
a
man
in
a
white
apron
and
a
square
paper
cap
who
sat
on
a
fallen
column
eating
bread
and
cheese
with
a
beg
your
pardon
philip
gasped
i
sure
said
the
man
it
a
dangerous
thing
to
do
master
philip
running
sheer
on
to
chaps
he
set
philip
on
his
feet
and
waved
the
knife
which
had
been
so
often
sharpened
that
the
blade
was
half
worn
away
you
down
and
get
your
breath
he
said
kindly
it
said
philip
it
is
who
should
i
be
if
i
was
me
that
poetry
how
did
you
get
here
said
the
man
going
on
with
his
bread
and
cheese
while
he
talked
quite
in
the
friendliest
way
telling
tell
then
said
philip
impatiently
but
he
sat
down
you
say
it
me
who
be
it

it
a
name
old
perrin
said
pip
mean
of
course
i
beg
your
pardon

carpenter

philip

the
man
encouragingly

of
things

old
perrin

philip

the
thousandth
of
an
inch
they
was
and
that
how
i
got
here
so
now

know
what
are
you

said
philip
wriggling
restlessly
on
the
fallen
column
for
you
them
as
knows
sent
me
out
to
meet
you
and
give
you
a
hint
of
what
expected
of
you
what
said
philip
mean
i
think
it
very
kind
of
you
what
expected
of
time
said
the
carpenter
nothing
ai
expected
of
you
till
towards
sundown
do
think
it
was
most
awfully
kind
of
you
said
philip
who
had
now
thought
this
over
was
kind
to
old
perrin
once
said
that
person
i
said
philip
much
surprised
when
my
little
girl
was
ailing
you
brought
her
a
lot
of
pears
off
your
own
tree
not
one
of
you
did
yourself
that
year
miss
helen
told
me
and
you
brought
back
our
kitten
the
sandy
and
white
one
with
black
spots
when
it
strayed
so
i
was
quite
willing
to
come
and
meet
you
when
so
told
and
knowing
something
of
young
peckers
owing
to
being
in
business
once
next
door
to
a
boys
school
i
made
so
bold
as
to
bring
you
a
snack
he
reached
a
hand
down
behind
the
fallen
pillar
on
which
they
sat
and
brought
up
a
basket
he
said
and
philip
raising
the
lid
was
delighted
to
find
that
he
was
hungry
it
was
a
pleasant
basketful
meat
pasties
red
hairy
gooseberries
a
stone
bottle
of
a
blue
mug
with
philip
on
it
in
gold
letters
a
slice
of
soda
cake
and
two
farthing
sure
i
seen
that
basket
before
said
the
boy
as
he
ate
enough
it
the
one
you
brought
them
pears
down
in
look
here
said
philip
through
his
seventh
bite
of
pasty
tell
me
how
you
got
here
and
tell
me
where
you
got
to
simply
no
idea
how
muddling
it
all
is
to
me
do
tell
me
where
are
we
i
mean
and
why
and
what
i
got
to
do
and
why
and
when
tell
me
every
single
thing
and
he
took
the
eighth
bite
really
do
know
sir
said
philip
contemplating
the
ninth
or
last
bite
but
one
it
was
a
large
pasty
then
here
goes
but
i
was
always
a
poor
speaker
and
so
considered
even
by
friends
at
cricket
dinners
and
what
not
i
do
want
you
to
speak
said
philip
tell
me
then
how
did
i
get
here
i
got
here
through
having
made
them
bricks
what
you
built
this
old
ancient
place
with
built
with
them
bricks
i
made
you
i
understand
as
this
was
the
first
building
you
ever
put
up
that
why
it
first
on
the
road
to
where
you
want
to
get
to
philip
looked
round
at
the
stonehenge
building
and
saw
that
it
was
indeed
built
of
enormous
oak
bricks
course
he
said
i
grown
smaller
they
grown
bigger
said
perrin
the
same
thing
you
see
it
like
this
all
the
cities
and
things
you
ever
built
is
in
this
country
i
do
know
how
it
managed
no
what
you
do
but
so
it
is
and
as
you
made
you
the
right
to
come
to
them
if
you
can
get
there
and
you
have
got
there
it
is
every
one
has
the
luck
told
well
then
you
made
the
cities
but
you
made
out
of
what
other
folks
had
made
things
like
bricks
and
chessmen
and
books
and
candlesticks
and
dominoes
and
brass
basins
and
every
sort
of
kind
of
thing
an
all
the
people
who
helped
to
make
all
them
things
you
used
to
build
with
they
all
here
too
see
the
thing
if
it
was
no
more
than
the
lad
that
turned
the
handle
of
the
grindstone
to
sharp
the
knife
that
carved
a
bit
of
a
cabinet
or
what
not
or
a
child
that
picked
a
teazle
to
finish
a
bit
of
the
cloth
that
glued
on
to
the
bottom
of
a
chessman
they
all
here
they
what
called
the
population
of
your
cities
see
they
got
small
like
i
have
said
philip
the
cities
has
got
big
said
the
carpenter
comes
to
the
same
thing
i
wish
you
would
interrupt
master
philip
you
put
me
out
wo
again
said
philip
do
tell
me
just
one
thing
how
can
you
be
here
and
at
amblehurst
too
come
here
said
the
carpenter
slowly
we
asleep
said
philip
deeply
disappointed
just
a
dream
then
it
we
come
here
when
we
too
sound
asleep
to
dream
you
go
through
the
dreams
and
come
out
on
the
other
side
where
real
that
on
said
philip
dunno
where
i
was
you
do
put
me
out
so
you
something
or
other
said
philip
yes
well
all
those
people
as
made
the
things
you
made
the
cities
of
they
live
in
the
cities
and
they
made
the
insides
to
the
houses
do
they
do
they
just
live
here
and
they
buy
and
sell
and
plant
gardens
and
work
and
play
like
everybody
does
in
other
cities
and
when
they
go
to
sleep
they
go
slap
through
their
dreams
and
into
the
other
world
and
work
and
play
there
see
that
how
it
goes
on
there
a
lot
more
but
that
enough
for
one
time
you
get
on
with
your
gooseberries

are
all
real
people

they

mr
noah
those
is
aristocracy

ones
you
put
in
when
you
built
the
cities
they
our
old
families
very
much
respected
they
all
very
high
up
in
the
world
came
over
with
the
conker
as
the
saying
is
there
the
noah
family
they
the
oldest
of
all
of
course
and
the
dolls
you
put
in
different
times
and
the
tin
soldiers
and
of
course
all
the
noah
ark
animals
is
alive
except
when
you
used
them
for
building
and
then
they
statues
i
do
see
said
philip
really
do
see
how
all
these
cities
that
i
built
at
different
times
can
still
be
here
all
together
and
all
going
on
at
once
when
i
know
they
all
been
pulled
down
i
no
scholard
but
i
did
hear
noah
say
once
in
a
lecture
a
speaker
if
you
like
i
heard
him
say
it
was
like
when
you
take
a
person
photo
the
person
is
so
many
inches
thick
through
and
so
many
feet
high
and
he
round
and
he
solid
but
in
the
photo
he
because
everything
flat
in
photos
but
all
the
same
him
right
enough
you
get
him
into
the
photo
then
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
get
out
again
into
where
everything
thick
and
tall
and
round
and
solid
and
it
quite
easy
i
believe
once
you
know
the
trick
said
philip
suddenly
think
my
head
going
to
burst
said
the
carpenter
kindly
felt
like
that
at
first
lie
down
and
try
to
sleep
it
off
a
bit
eddication
does
go
to
your
head
something
crool
i
often
noticed
it
and
indeed
philip
was
quite
glad
to
lie
down
among
the
long
grass
and
be
covered
up
with
the
carpenter
coat
he
fell
asleep
at
once
an
hour
later
he
woke
again
looked
at
the
face
of
perrin
and
began
to
remember
glad
here
anyhow
he
said
to
the
carpenter
was
horribly
lonely
you
do
know
why
i
was
sent
to
meet
you
said
perrin
simply
how
did
you
know
noah
sent
for
me
early
this
morning
bless
you
he
knows
all
about
everything
says
he
you
go
and
meet
and
tell
all
you
can
if
he
wants
to
be
a
deliverer
let
says
mr
noah
how
do
you
begin
being
a
deliverer
philip
asked
sitting
up
and
feeling
suddenly
very
grand
and
manly
and
very
glad
that
lucy
was
not
there
to
interfere
lots
of
different
ways
said
perrin
particular
way
simple
you
just
got
to
kill
the
dragon
dragon
said
perrin
he
all
over
the
place
and
as
green
as
grass
he
is
lively
as
a
kitten
he
got
a
broken
spear
sticking
out
of
his
side
so
some
one
must
have
had
a
try
at
baggin
him
some
time
or
another
you
think
said
philip
a
little
overcome
by
this
vivid
picture
perhaps
i
better
look
for
lucy
first
and
be
a
deliverer
afterwards
you
said
perrin
not
said
philip
doubtfully
see
said
the
carpenter
you
got
to
consider
is
are
you
going
to
be
the
hero
of
this
adventure
or
ai
you
you
ca
it
both
ways
an
if
you
are
you
may
well
make
up
your
mind
cause
killing
a
dragon
ai
the
end
of
it
not
by
no
means
you
mean
there
are
more
dragons
dragons
said
the
carpenter
soothingly
dragons
exactly
but
there
i
do
want
to
lower
your
heart
if
you
kills
the
dragon
then
afterwards
there
six
more
hard
things
you
got
to
do
and
then
they
make
you
king
take
it
or
leave
it
only
if
you
take
it
we
best
be
starting
and
anyhow
we
may
as
well
get
a
move
on
us
because
at
sundown
the
dragon
comes
out
to
drink
and
exercise
of
himself
you
can
hear
him
rattling
all
night
among
these
ruins
miles
off
you
can
of
a
still
night
i
do
want
to
be
a
deliverer
said
philip
slowly
you
be
a
destroyer
said
the
carpenter
only
these
two
situations
vacant
here
at
present
come
master
philip
sir
talk
as
if
you
was
going
to
be
a
man
and
do
your
duty
for
england
home
and
beauty
like
it
says
in
the
song
let
be
starting
shall
us
think
i
ought
to
be
the
deliverer
stands
for
nothing
said
perrin
think
you
a
going
to
the
deliverer
that
what
i
think
come
on
as
they
rose
to
go
philip
had
a
brief
fleeting
vision
of
a
very
smart
lady
in
a
motor
veil
disappearing
round
the
corner
of
a
pillar
there
many
motors
about
here
he
asked
not
wishing
to
talk
any
more
about
dragons
just
then
a
single
one
said
perrin
unexpectedly
yet
phonographs
nor
railways
nor
factory
chimneys
nor
none
of
them
loud
ugly
things
nor
yet
advertisements
nor
newspapers
nor
barbed
wire
after
that
the
two
walked
silently
away
from
the
ruin
philip
was
trying
to
feel
as
brave
and
confident
as
a
deliverer
should
he
reminded
himself
of
george
and
he
remembered
that
the
hero
fails
to
kill
the
dragon
but
he
still
felt
a
little
uneasy
it
takes
some
time
to
accustom
yourself
to
being
a
hero
but
he
could
not
help
looking
over
his
shoulder
every
now
and
then
to
see
if
the
dragon
was
coming
so
far
it
was
said
perrin
as
they
drew
near
a
square
tower
with
a
long
flight
of
steps
leading
up
to
it
do
you
say
was
saying
anything
said
philip
mean
are
you
going
to
be
the
deliverer
then
something
in
philip
heart
seemed
to
swell
and
a
choking
feeling
came
into
his
throat
and
he
felt
more
frightened
than
he
had
ever
felt
before
as
he
said
looking
as
brave
as
he
could
i
am
perrin
clapped
his
hands
and
instantly
from
the
doors
of
the
tower
and
from
behind
it
came
dozens
of
people
and
down
the
long
steps
alone
came
noah
moving
with
careful
dignity
and
carrying
his
yellow
mat
neatly
rolled
under
his
arm
all
the
people
clapped
their
hands
till
noah
standing
on
the
third
step
raised
his
hands
to
command
silence
he
said
of
polistopolis
you
see
before
you
one
who
says
that
he
is
the
deliverer
he
was
yesterday
arrested
and
tried
as
a
trespasser
and
condemned
to
imprisonment
he
escaped
and
you
all
assumed
that
he
was
the
destroyer
in
disguise
but
now
he
has
returned
and
of
his
own
free
will
he
chooses
to
attempt
the
accomplishment
of
the
seven
great
deeds
and
the
first
of
these
is
the
killing
of
the
great
green
dragon
the
people
who
were
a
mixed
crowd
of
all
nations
cheered
loudly
now
said
noah
will
make
him
our
knight
said
noah
token
of
fealty
to
the
kingdom
of
cities
philip
knelt
shall
now
speak
after
me
said
noah
solemnly
what
i
say
he
whispered
and
philip
said
it
this
was
it
philip
claim
to
be
the
deliverer
of
this
great
nation
and
i
pledge
myself
to
carry
out
the
seven
great
deeds
that
shall
prove
my
claim
to
the
deliverership
and
the
throne
i
pledge
my
honour
to
be
the
champion
of
this
city
and
the
enemy
of
its
destroyer
when
philip
had
said
this
noah
drew
forth
a
bright
sword
and
held
it
over
him
must
be
knighted
he
said
among
my
audience
who
have
read
any
history
will
be
aware
that
no
mere
commoner
can
expect
to
conquer
a
dragon
we
must
give
our
deliverer
every
chance
so
i
will
make
him
a
knight
he
tapped
philip
lightly
on
the
shoulder
and
said
up
sir
philip
this
was
really
grand
and
philip
felt
new
courage
as
noah
handed
him
the
silver
sword
and
all
the
people
cheered
but
as
the
cheers
died
down
a
thin
and
disagreeable
voice
suddenly
said
claim
to
be
the
deliverer
too
it
was
like
a
thunderbolt
every
one
stopped
cheering
and
stood
with
mouth
open
and
head
turned
towards
the
person
who
had
spoken
and
the
person
who
had
spoken
was
the
smartly
dressed
lady
in
the
motor
veil
whom
philip
had
seen
among
the
ruins
trespasser
a
trespasser
cried
the
crowd
prison
with
it
and
angry
threatening
voices
began
to
arise
no
more
a
trespasser
than
he
is
said
the
voice
if
i
say
i
am
the
deliverer
you
ca
stop
me
i
can
kill
dragons
or
do
anything
can
do
trespasser
said
noah
with
cold
dignity
should
have
spoken
earlier
at
present
sir
philip
occupies
the
position
of
candidate
to
the
post
of
there
is
no
other
position
open
to
you
except
that
of
destroyer
illustration
trespasser
said
noah
with
cold
dignity
suppose
the
boy
does
do
it
said
the
voice
behind
the
veil
said
noah
may
if
you
choose
occupy
for
the
present
the
position
of
to
the
claimancy
of
the
deliverership
an
office
now
and
here
created
expressly
for
you
the
position
of
claimant
to
the
destroyership
is
also
he
added
reflectively
to
you
if
he
does
do
it
said
the
veiled
lady
can
be
the
deliverer
can
try
said
noah
are
a
special
set
of
tasks
to
be
performed
if
the
claimant
to
the
deliverership
be
a
woman
are
they
said
the
veiled
lady
sir
philip
fails
you
will
be
duly
instructed
in
the
deeds
required
of
a
deliverer
who
is
a
woman
and
now
my
friends
let
us
retire
and
leave
sir
philip
to
deal
with
the
dragon
we
shall
watch
anxiously
from
yonder
ramparts
he
added
encouragingly
is
any
one
to
help
me
said
philip
deeply
uneasy
is
not
usual
said
noah
champions
to
require
assistance
with
dragons
should
think
not
indeed
said
the
veiled
lady
you
not
going
the
usual
way
about
it
at
all
where
the
princess
i
should
like
to
know
is
any
princess
said
noah
it
wo
be
a
proper
she
said
with
an
angry
shaking
of
skirts
all
i
can
say
wish
it
all
said
noah
to
himself
there
is
a
princess
it
is
fair
said
the
veiled
one
i
shall
consider
it
my
turn
to
be
deliverer
silent
woman
said
noah
indeed
said
the
lady
ought
to
have
a
proper
title
title
is
the
pretender
to
the
know
she
interrupted
you
forget
you
speaking
to
a
lady
you
can
call
me
the
pretenderette
noah
turned
coldly
from
her
and
pressed
two
roman
candles
and
a
box
of
matches
into
philip
hand
you
have
arranged
your
plans
and
are
quite
sure
that
you
will
be
able
to
kill
the
dragon
light
one
of
these
we
will
then
have
a
princess
in
readiness
and
on
observing
your
signal
will
tie
her
to
a
tree
or
since
this
is
a
district
where
trees
are
rare
and
buildings
frequent
to
a
pillar
she
will
be
perfectly
safe
if
you
make
your
plans
correctly
and
in
any
case
you
must
not
attempt
to
deal
with
the
dragon
without
first
lighting
the
roman
candle
the
dragon
will
see
it
and
go
away
said
noah
perhaps
he
will
see
it
and
not
go
away
time
alone
will
show
the
task
that
is
without
difficulties
can
never
really
appeal
to
a
hero
you
will
find
weapons
cords
nets
shields
and
various
first
aids
to
the
young
in
the
vaults
below
this
tower
good
evening
sir
philip
he
ended
warmly
wish
you
every
success
and
with
that
the
whole
crowd
began
to
go
away
know
who
you
ought
to
have
for
princess
the
pretenderette
said
as
they
went
and
noah
said
in
court
is
a
court
said
the
pretenderette
aggravatingly
justice
is
is
a
court
said
noah
i
accuse
you
of
contempt
of
it
guards
arrest
this
person
and
take
her
to
prison
at
once
there
was
a
scuffling
and
a
shrieking
and
then
the
voices
withdrew
gradually
the
angry
voice
of
even
the
pretenderette
growing
fainter
and
fainter
till
it
died
away
altogether
philip
was
left
alone
his
first
act
was
to
go
up
to
the
top
of
the
tower
and
look
out
to
see
if
he
could
see
the
dragon
he
looked
east
and
north
and
south
and
west
and
he
saw
the
ramparts
of
the
fort
where
noah
and
the
others
were
now
safely
bestowed
he
saw
also
other
towers
and
cities
in
the
distance
and
he
saw
the
ruins
where
he
had
met
perrin
and
among
those
ruins
something
was
moving
something
long
and
jointed
and
green
it
could
be
nothing
but
the
dragon
crikey
said
philip
to
himself
shall
i
do
perhaps
better
see
what
weapons
there
are
so
he
ran
down
the
stairs
and
down
and
down
till
he
came
to
the
vaults
of
the
castle
and
there
he
found
everything
a
could
possibly
need
even
to
a
little
red
book
called
the
vade
mecum
or
a
complete
guide
to
the
good
sport
of
and
a
pair
of
excellent
the
top
of
the
tower
seemed
the
safest
place
it
was
there
that
he
tried
to
read
the
book
the
words
were
very
long
and
most
difficultly
spelt
but
he
did
manage
to
make
out
that
all
dragons
sleep
for
one
hour
after
sunset
then
he
heard
a
loud
rattling
sound
from
the
ruin
and
he
knew
it
was
the
dragon
who
was
making
that
sound
so
he
looked
through
the
frowning
with
anxiety
to
see
what
the
dragon
was
doing
and
as
he
looked
he
started
and
almost
dropped
the
glasses
and
the
frown
cleared
away
from
his
forehead
and
he
gave
a
sigh
that
was
almost
a
sob
and
almost
a
laugh
and
then
he
said
old
thing
then
he
looked
again
and
this
is
what
he
saw
an
enormous
green
dragon
very
long
and
that
rattled
as
it
moved
going
in
and
out
among
the
ruins
rubbing
itself
against
the
fallen
pillars
and
the
reason
philip
laughed
and
sighed
was
that
he
knew
that
dragon
very
well
indeed
he
had
known
it
long
ago
it
was
the
clockwork
lizard
that
had
been
given
him
the
christmas
before
last
and
he
remembered
that
he
had
put
it
into
one
of
the
cities
he
and
helen
had
built
together
only
now
of
course
it
had
grown
big
and
had
come
alive
like
all
the
other
images
of
live
things
he
had
put
in
his
cities
but
he
saw
that
it
was
still
a
clockwork
creature
and
its
key
was
sticking
out
of
its
side
and
it
was
rubbing
itself
against
the
pillars
so
as
to
turn
the
key
and
wind
itself
up
but
this
was
a
slow
business
and
the
winding
was
not
half
done
when
the
sun
set
the
dragon
instantly
lay
down
and
went
to
sleep
said
philip
i
got
to
think
he
did
think
harder
than
he
had
ever
done
before
and
when
he
had
finished
thinking
he
went
down
into
the
vault
and
got
a
long
rope
then
he
stood
still
a
moment
wondering
if
he
really
were
brave
enough
and
then
he
remembered
up
sir
philip
and
he
knew
that
a
knight
simply
be
afraid
so
he
went
out
in
the
dusk
towards
the
dragon
he
knew
it
would
sleep
for
an
hour
but
all
the
same
and
the
twilight
was
growing
deeper
and
deeper
still
there
was
plenty
of
light
to
find
the
ruin
and
also
to
find
the
dragon
there
it
lay
about
ten
or
twelve
yards
of
solid
dark
its
metal
claws
gleamed
in
the
last
of
the
daylight
its
great
mouth
was
open
and
its
breathing
as
it
slept
was
like
the
sound
of
the
sea
on
a
rough
night
up
sir
philip
he
said
to
himself
and
walked
along
close
to
the
dragon
till
he
came
to
the
middle
part
where
the
key
was
sticking
out
which
perrin
had
thought
was
a
piece
of
an
old
spear
with
which
some
one
had
once
tried
to
kill
the
monster
philip
fastened
one
end
of
his
rope
very
securely
to
the
key
how
thankful
he
was
that
helen
had
taught
him
to
tie
knots
that
were
not
the
dragon
lay
quite
still
and
went
on
breathing
like
a
stormy
sea
then
the
fastened
the
other
end
of
the
rope
to
the
main
wall
of
the
ruin
which
was
very
strong
and
firm
and
then
he
went
back
to
his
tower
as
fast
as
he
could
and
struck
a
match
and
lighted
his
roman
candle
you
see
the
idea
it
was
really
rather
a
clever
one
when
the
dragon
woke
it
would
find
that
it
was
held
prisoner
by
the
ropes
it
would
be
furious
and
try
to
get
free
and
in
its
struggles
it
would
be
certain
to
get
free
but
this
it
could
only
do
by
detaching
itself
from
its
key
when
once
the
key
was
out
the
dragon
would
be
unable
to
wind
itself
up
any
more
and
would
be
as
good
as
dead
of
course
sir
philip
could
cut
off
its
head
with
the
sword
if
noah
really
wished
it
it
was
as
you
see
an
excellent
plan
as
far
as
it
went
philip
sat
on
the
top
of
his
tower
quite
free
from
anxiety
and
ate
a
few
hairy
red
gooseberries
that
happened
to
be
loose
in
his
pocket
within
three
minutes
of
his
lighting
his
roman
candle
a
shower
of
golden
rain
went
up
in
the
south
some
immense
appeared
in
the
east
and
in
the
north
a
long
line
of
rockets
presented
almost
the
appearance
of
an
aurora
borealis
red
fire
green
fire
then
rockets
again
the
whole
of
the
plain
was
lit
by
more
fireworks
than
philip
had
ever
seen
even
at
the
crystal
palace
by
their
light
he
saw
a
procession
come
out
of
the
fort
cross
to
a
pillar
that
stood
solitary
on
the
plain
and
tie
to
it
a
white
figure
princess
i
suppose
said
philip
all
right
anyway
then
the
procession
went
back
to
the
fort
and
then
the
dragon
awoke
philip
could
see
the
great
creature
stretching
itself
and
shaking
its
vast
head
as
a
dog
does
when
it
comes
out
of
the
water
expect
it
does
like
the
fireworks
said
philip
and
he
was
quite
right
and
now
the
dragon
saw
the
princess
who
had
been
placed
at
a
convenient
spot
about
between
the
ruins
and
philip
tower
it
threw
up
its
snout
and
uttered
a
devastating
howl
and
philip
felt
with
a
thrill
of
horror
that
clockwork
or
no
clockwork
the
brute
was
alive
and
desperately
dangerous
and
now
it
had
perceived
that
it
was
bound
with
great
heavings
and
throes
with
snortings
and
bellowings
with
scratchings
and
tearings
of
its
great
claws
and
lashings
of
its
terrible
tail
it
writhed
and
fought
to
be
free
and
the
light
of
thousands
of
fireworks
illuminated
the
gigantic
struggle
then
what
philip
had
known
would
happen
did
happen
the
great
wall
held
fast
the
rope
held
fast
the
dragon
held
fast
it
was
the
key
that
gave
way
with
an
echoing
grinding
rusty
sound
like
a
goods
train
shunting
on
a
siding
the
key
was
drawn
from
the
keyhole
in
the
dragon
side
and
left
still
fast
to
its
rope
like
an
anchor
to
a
cable
for
now
that
happened
which
philip
had
not
foreseen
he
had
forgotten
that
before
it
fell
asleep
the
dragon
had
partly
wound
itself
up
and
its
struggles
had
not
used
up
all
the
winding
there
was
go
in
the
dragon
yet
and
with
a
yell
of
fury
it
set
off
across
the
plain
wriggling
its
green
rattling
length
towards
the
princess
and
now
there
was
no
time
to
think
whether
one
was
afraid
or
not
philip
went
down
those
tower
stairs
more
quickly
than
he
had
ever
gone
down
stairs
in
his
life
and
he
was
not
bad
at
stairs
even
at
ordinary
times
he
put
his
sword
over
his
shoulder
as
you
do
a
gun
and
ran
like
the
dragon
he
made
straight
for
the
princess
and
now
it
was
a
race
between
him
and
the
dragon
philip
ran
and
ran
his
heart
thumped
his
feet
had
that
leaden
feeling
that
comes
in
nightmares
he
felt
as
if
he
were
dying
keep
on
keep
on
faster
faster
you
must
stop
ah
that
better
he
has
got
his
second
wind
he
is
going
faster
and
the
dragon
or
is
it
fancy
is
going
not
quite
so
fast
how
he
did
it
philip
never
knew
but
with
a
last
spurt
he
reached
the
pillar
where
the
princess
stood
bound
and
the
dragon
was
twenty
yards
away
coming
on
and
on
and
on
philip
stood
quite
still
recovering
his
breath
and
more
and
more
slowly
but
with
no
sign
of
stopping
the
dragon
came
on
behind
him
where
the
pillar
was
philip
heard
some
one
crying
softly
then
the
dragon
was
quite
near
philip
took
three
steps
forward
took
aim
with
his
sword
shut
his
eyes
and
hit
as
hard
as
he
could
then
something
hard
and
heavy
knocked
him
over
and
for
a
time
he
knew
no
more
when
he
came
to
himself
again
noah
was
giving
him
something
nasty
to
drink
out
of
a
medicine
glass
perrin
was
patting
him
on
the
back
all
the
people
were
shouting
like
mad
and
more
fireworks
than
ever
were
being
let
off
beside
him
lay
the
dragon
lifeless
and
still
illustration
then
something
hard
and
heavy
knocked
him
over
said
philip
i
really
do
it
did
indeed
said
noah
you
may
succeed
with
the
other
deeds
you
are
the
hero
of
this
one
and
now
if
you
feel
well
enough
prepare
to
receive
the
reward
of
valour
and
chivalry
said
philip
brightening
did
know
there
was
to
be
a
reward
the
usual
one
said
mr
noah
princess
you
know
philip
became
aware
that
a
figure
in
a
white
veil
was
standing
quite
near
him
round
its
feet
lay
lengths
of
cut
rope
princess
is
yours
said
noah
with
generous
affability
i
do
want
her
said
philip
adding
by
an
afterthought
you
should
have
thought
of
that
before
said
noah
ca
go
doing
deeds
of
valour
you
know
and
then
shirking
the
reward
take
her
she
is
yours
one
who
likes
may
have
her
said
philip
desperately
mine
i
can
give
her
away
ca
i
you
must
see
yourself
i
ca
be
bothered
with
princesses
if
i
got
all
those
other
deeds
to
do
not
my
affair
said
noah
you
might
arrange
to
board
her
out
while
you
doing
your
deeds
but
at
present
she
is
waiting
for
you
to
take
her
by
the
hand
and
raise
her
veil
i
said
philip
miserably
here
goes
he
took
a
small
cold
hand
in
one
of
his
and
with
the
other
lifted
very
gingerly
a
corner
of
the
veil
the
other
hand
of
the
princess
drew
back
the
veil
and
the
and
the
princess
were
face
to
face
cried
philip
between
relief
and
disgust
only
lucy
chapter
v
on
the
carpet
the
princess
was
just
lucy
too
bad
said
philip
do
think
then
he
stopped
short
and
just
looked
cross
princess
and
the
champion
will
now
have
their
teas
said
noah
about
face
everybody
please
and
quick
march
philip
and
lucy
found
themselves
marching
side
by
side
through
the
night
made
yellow
with
continuous
fireworks
you
must
picture
them
marching
across
a
great
plain
of
grass
where
many
coloured
flowers
grew
you
see
a
good
many
of
philip
buildings
had
been
made
on
the
carpet
at
home
which
was
green
with
pink
and
blue
and
yellow
and
white
flowers
and
this
carpet
had
turned
into
grass
and
growing
flowers
following
that
strange
law
which
caused
things
to
change
into
other
things
like
themselves
but
larger
and
really
belonging
to
a
living
world
no
one
spoke
philip
said
nothing
because
he
was
in
a
bad
temper
and
if
you
are
in
a
bad
temper
nothing
is
a
good
thing
to
say
to
circumvent
a
dragon
and
then
kill
it
and
to
have
such
an
adventure
end
in
tea
with
lucy
was
too
much
and
he
had
other
reasons
for
silence
too
and
lucy
was
silent
because
she
had
so
much
to
say
that
she
did
know
where
to
begin
and
besides
she
could
feel
how
cross
philip
was
the
crowd
did
not
talk
because
it
was
not
etiquette
to
talk
when
taking
part
in
processions
noah
did
not
talk
because
it
made
him
out
of
breath
to
walk
and
talk
at
the
same
time
two
things
neither
of
which
he
had
been
designed
to
do
so
that
it
was
quite
a
silent
party
which
at
last
passed
through
the
gateway
of
the
town
and
up
its
streets
philip
wondered
where
the
tea
would
be
not
in
the
prison
of
course
it
was
very
late
for
tea
too
quite
the
middle
of
the
night
it
seemed
but
all
the
streets
were
brilliantly
lighted
and
flags
and
festoons
of
flowers
hung
from
all
the
windows
and
across
all
the
streets
it
was
in
the
front
of
a
big
building
in
one
of
the
great
squares
of
the
city
that
an
extra
display
of
coloured
lamps
disclosed
open
doors
and
steps
noah
hurried
up
them
and
turned
to
receive
philip
and
lucy
city
of
polistopolis
he
said
unworthy
representative
i
am
greets
in
my
person
the
most
noble
sir
philip
knight
and
slayer
of
the
dragon
also
the
princess
whom
he
has
rescued
be
pleased
to
enter
they
went
up
the
covered
steps
and
into
a
hall
very
splendid
with
silver
and
ivory
noah
stooped
to
a
confidential
question
like
a
wash
perhaps
he
said
your
princess
too
and
perhaps
you
like
to
dress
up
a
little
before
the
banquet
you
know
said
philip
thought
it
was
tea
before
pleasure
said
noah
the
banquet
then
the
tea
this
way
to
the
there
were
two
doors
side
by
side
on
one
door
was
painted
on
the
other
out
said
noah
paint
is
wet
you
see
there
was
much
time
philip
found
his
very
interesting
the
walls
were
entirely
of
and
on
tables
in
the
middle
of
the
room
lay
all
sorts
of
clothes
of
beautiful
colours
and
odd
shapes
shoes
stockings
hats
crowns
armour
swords
cloaks
breeches
waistcoats
jerkins
trunk
hose
an
open
door
showed
a
marble
the
bath
was
sunk
in
the
floor
as
the
baths
of
luxurious
roman
empresses
used
to
be
and
as
nowadays
baths
sometimes
are
in
model
dwellings
only
i
am
told
that
some
people
keep
their
coals
in
the
baths
which
is
quite
useless
because
coals
are
always
black
however
much
you
wash
them
philip
undressed
and
went
into
the
warm
clear
water
greenish
between
the
air
and
the
marble
why
is
it
so
pleasant
to
have
a
bath
and
so
tiresome
to
wash
your
hands
and
face
in
a
basin
he
put
on
his
shirt
and
knickerbockers
again
and
wandered
round
the
room
looking
at
the
clothes
laid
out
there
and
wondering
which
of
the
wonderful
costumes
would
be
really
suitable
for
a
knight
to
wear
at
a
banquet
after
considerable
hesitation
he
decided
on
a
little
soft
shirt
of
that
made
just
a
double
handful
of
tiny
steel
links
as
he
held
it
but
a
difficulty
arose
do
know
how
to
put
it
on
said
philip
i
expect
the
banquet
is
waiting
how
cross
it
be
he
stood
undecided
holding
the
chain
mail
in
his
hands
when
his
eyes
fell
on
a
bell
handle
above
it
was
an
ivory
plate
and
on
it
in
black
letters
the
word
valet
philip
rang
the
bell
instantly
a
soft
tap
at
the
door
heralded
the
entrance
of
a
person
whom
philip
at
the
first
glance
supposed
to
be
a
sandwich
man
but
the
second
glance
showed
that
the
oblong
flat
things
which
he
wore
were
not
but
dominoes
the
person
between
them
bowed
low
said
philip
rang
for
the
valet
am
not
the
valet
said
the
person
who
seemed
to
be
in
skintight
black
clothes
under
his
dominoes
am
the
master
of
the
robes
i
only
attend
on
really
distinguished
persons
at
your
service
sir
have
you
chosen
your
dress
like
to
wear
the
armour
said
philip
holding
it
out
seems
the
right
thing
for
a
knight
he
added
so
sir
i
confirm
your
opinion
he
proceeded
to
dress
philip
in
a
white
tunic
and
to
fasten
the
coat
of
mail
over
this
had
a
great
deal
of
experience
he
said
could
have
chosen
better
you
see
i
master
of
the
subject
of
dress
i
am
able
to
give
my
whole
mind
to
it
my
own
dress
being
fixed
by
law
and
not
subject
to
changes
of
fashion
leaves
me
free
to
think
for
others
and
i
think
deeply
but
i
see
that
you
can
think
for
yourself
you
have
no
idea
how
jolly
philip
looked
in
the
mail
coat
and
mailed
hood
just
like
a
crusader
at
the
doorway
of
the
he
met
lucy
in
a
short
white
dress
and
a
coronal
of
pearls
round
her
head
always
wanted
to
be
a
fairy
she
said
you
have
any
one
to
dress
you
he
asked
no
said
lucy
calmly
always
dress
myself
have
the
advantage
there
said
bowing
and
walking
backwards
banquet
is
spread
it
turned
out
to
be
spread
on
three
tables
one
along
each
side
of
a
great
room
and
one
across
the
top
of
the
room
on
a
dais
such
a
table
as
that
high
one
at
which
dons
and
distinguished
strangers
sit
in
the
halls
of
colleges
noah
was
already
in
his
place
in
the
middle
of
the
high
table
and
lucy
and
philip
now
took
their
places
at
each
side
of
him
the
table
was
spread
with
all
sorts
of
foods
and
plates
of
a
pattern
very
familiar
to
philip
they
were
in
fact
as
he
soon
realised
the
painted
wooden
plates
from
his
sister
old
house
there
was
no
food
just
in
front
of
the
children
only
a
great
empty
bowl
of
silver
philip
fingered
his
knife
and
fork
the
pattern
of
those
also
was
familiar
to
him
they
were
indeed
the
little
leaden
ones
out
of
the
dolls
house
of
green
and
silver
filagree
he
hungrily
waited
servants
in
straight
yellow
dresses
and
red
masks
and
caps
were
beginning
to
handle
the
dishes
a
dish
was
handed
to
him
a
beautiful
jelly
it
looked
like
he
took
up
his
spoon
and
was
just
about
to
help
himself
when
noah
whispered
ardently
and
as
philip
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
he
added
still
in
a
whisper
you
have
you
never
had
a
pretending
banquet
but
before
he
had
caught
the
whisper
philip
had
tried
to
press
the
edge
of
the
leaden
spoon
into
the
shape
of
jelly
and
he
felt
that
the
jelly
was
quite
hard
he
went
through
the
form
of
helping
himself
but
it
was
just
nothing
that
he
put
on
his
plate
and
he
saw
that
noah
and
lucy
and
all
the
other
guests
did
the
same
presently
another
dish
was
handed
to
him
there
was
no
changing
of
plates
philip
thought
bitterly
this
time
it
was
a
fat
goose
not
carved
and
now
philip
saw
that
it
was
attached
to
its
dish
with
glue
then
he
understood
you
know
the
beautiful
but
uneatable
feasts
which
are
given
you
in
a
white
cardboard
box
with
blue
binding
and
fine
shavings
to
pack
the
dishes
and
keep
them
from
breaking
i
myself
when
i
was
little
had
such
a
banquet
in
a
box
there
were
twelve
dishes
a
ham
brown
and
shapely
a
pair
of
roast
chickens
also
brown
and
more
anatomical
than
the
ham
a
glazed
tongue
real
none
of
your
tinned
round
mysteries
a
dish
of
sausages
two
handsome
fish
a
little
blue
perhaps
a
joint
of
beef
ribs
i
think
very
red
as
to
the
lean
and
very
white
in
the
fat
parts
a
pork
pie
delicately
bronzed
like
a
traveller
in
central
africa
for
sweets
i
had
shapes
shapes
of
beauty
a
jelly
and
a
cream
a
swiss
roll
too
and
a
plum
pudding
asparagus
there
was
also
and
a
cauliflower
and
a
dish
of
the
greenest
peas
in
all
this
grey
world
this
was
my
banquet
outfit
i
remember
that
the
woodenness
of
it
all
depressed
us
wonderfully
the
oneness
of
dish
and
food
baffled
all
with
the
point
of
nurse
scissors
we
prised
the
viands
from
the
platters
but
their
wooden
nature
was
unconquerable
one
could
not
pretend
to
eat
a
whole
chicken
any
better
when
it
was
detached
from
its
dish
and
the
sausages
were
one
solid
block
and
when
you
licked
the
jelly
it
only
tasted
of
glue
and
paint
and
when
we
tried
to
the
chickens
at
the
nursery
grate
they
caught
fire
and
then
they
smelt
of
gasworks
and
but
i
am
wandering
when
you
remember
the
things
that
happened
when
you
were
a
child
you
could
go
on
writing
about
them
for
ever
i
will
put
all
this
in
brackets
and
then
you
need
not
read
it
if
you
do
want
to
illustration
noah
whispered
ardently
but
those
painted
wooden
foods
adhering
firmly
to
their
dishes
were
the
kind
of
food
of
which
the
banquet
now
offered
to
philip
and
lucy
was
composed
only
they
had
more
dishes
than
i
had
they
had
as
well
a
turkey
eight
raspberry
jam
tarts
a
a
melon
a
dish
of
oysters
in
the
shell
a
piece
of
boiled
bacon
and
a
leg
of
mutton
but
all
were
equally
wooden
and
uneatable
philip
and
lucy
growing
hungrier
and
hungrier
pretended
with
sinking
hearts
to
eat
and
enjoy
the
wooden
feast
wine
was
served
in
those
little
goblets
which
they
knew
so
well
where
the
double
glasses
restrained
and
contained
a
red
fluid
which
like
wine
they
did
not
want
wine
but
they
were
thirsty
as
well
as
hungry
philip
wondered
what
the
waiters
were
he
had
plenty
of
time
to
wonder
while
the
long
banquet
went
on
it
was
not
till
he
saw
a
group
of
them
standing
stiffly
together
at
the
end
of
the
hall
that
he
knew
they
must
be
the
matches
with
which
he
had
once
peopled
a
city
no
other
inhabitants
being
at
hand
when
all
the
dishes
had
been
handed
speeches
happened
and
noah
began
and
went
on
to
say
how
brave
and
clever
sir
philip
was
and
how
likely
it
was
that
he
would
turn
out
to
be
the
deliverer
philip
did
not
hear
all
this
speech
he
was
thinking
of
things
to
eat
then
every
one
in
the
hall
stood
and
shouted
and
philip
found
that
he
was
expected
to
take
his
turn
at
he
stood
up
trembling
and
wretched
and
he
said
you
very
much
i
want
to
be
the
deliverer
but
i
do
know
if
i
can
and
sat
down
again
amid
roars
of
applause
then
there
was
music
from
a
grated
gallery
and
then
i
can
not
begin
to
tell
you
how
glad
lucy
and
philip
were
noah
said
once
more
in
a
whisper
up
the
banquet
is
over
we
have
tea
turned
out
to
be
bread
and
milk
in
a
very
cosy
room
opening
out
of
the
only
lucy
philip
and
noah
were
present
bread
and
milk
is
very
good
even
when
you
have
to
eat
it
with
the
leaden
spoons
out
of
the
basket
when
it
was
much
later
noah
suddenly
said
and
in
a
maze
of
sleepy
repletion
look
that
up
in
the
dicker
will
you
the
children
went
to
bed
philip
bed
was
of
gold
with
yellow
satin
curtains
and
lucy
was
made
of
silver
with
curtains
of
silk
that
were
white
but
the
metals
and
colours
made
no
difference
to
their
deep
and
dreamless
sleep
and
in
the
morning
there
was
bread
and
milk
again
and
the
two
of
them
had
it
in
the
blue
room
without
noah
said
lucy
looking
up
from
the
bowl
of
white
floating
cubes
you
think
you

to
like
me
any
better
said
philip
brief
and
stern
like
the
skipper
in
the
song

lucy
i
ca

philip

philip
modestly
proud
only
one
she
said

six
more
and
she
ate
bread
and
milk
with
firmness
you
like
this
adventure
he
asked
abruptly
more
interesting
than
anything
that
ever
happened
to
me
she
said
you
were
nice
i
should
like
it
awfully
but
as
it
is
sorry
you
do
think
i
nice
said
he
what
do
think
she
said
philip
reflected
he
did
not
want
not
to
be
nice
none
of
us
do
though
you
might
not
think
it
to
see
how
some
of
us
behave
true
politeness
he
remembered
having
been
told
consists
in
showing
an
interest
in
other
people
affairs
me
he
said
very
much
wishing
to
be
polite
and
nice
me
what
happened
after
i
after
i
after
you
did
come
down
the
ladder
with
me
and
deserted
lucy
answered
promptly
sworn
friend
having
hooked
it
and
left
me
i
fell
down
and
both
my
hands
were
full
of
gravel
and
the
fierce
soldiery
surrounded
me
thought
you
were
coming
just
behind
me
said
philip
frowning
i
was
then
then
you
silly
not
to
stay
they
surrounded
me
the
soldiers
i
mean
and
the
captain
said
tell
me
the
truth
are
you
a
destroyer
or
a
deliverer
so
of
course
i
said
i
was
a
destroyer
whatever
i
was
and
then
they
took
me
to
the
palace
and
said
i
could
be
a
princess
till
the
deliverer
king
turned
up
they
said
she
giggled
gaily
my
hair
was
the
hair
of
a
deliverer
and
not
of
a
destroyer
and
i
been
most
awfully
happy
ever
since
have
you
said
philip
remembering
the
miserable
feeling
of
having
been
a
coward
and
a
sneak
that
had
come
upon
him
when
he
found
that
he
had
saved
his
own
skin
and
left
lucy
alone
in
an
unknown
and
dangerous
world
exactly
happy
i
should
call
it
beautiful
being
a
princess
said
lucy
wonder
what
your
next
noble
deed
will
be
i
wonder
whether
i
could
help
you
with
it
she
looked
wistfully
at
him
i
going
to
do
noble
deeds
i
do
them
i
do
want
any
help
thank
you
especially
from
girls
he
answered
wish
you
did
said
lucy
and
finished
her
bread
and
milk
philip
bowl
also
was
empty
he
stretched
arms
and
legs
and
neck
is
rum
he
said
this
began
i
never
thought
a
thing
like
this
begin
did
you
do
know
she
said
very
wonderful
i
always
been
expecting
things
to
be
more
wonderful
than
they
ever
have
been
you
get
sort
of
hints
and
nudges
you
know
fairy
tales
yes
and
dreams
you
ca
help
feeling
they
must
mean
and
your
sister
and
my
daddy
the
two
of
them
being
such
friends
when
they
were
little
and
then
parted
and
then
getting
friends
again
like
a
story
in
a
dream
is
it
and
your
building
the
city
and
me
helping
and
my
daddy
being
such
a
dear
darling
and
your
sister
being
such
a
darling
dear
it
did
make
me
think
beautiful
things
were
sort
of
likely
did
it
you
said
philip
mean
yes
he
said
and
he
was
in
that
moment
nearer
to
liking
lucy
than
he
had
ever
been
before
very
wonderful
is
it
said
a
respectful
cough
behind
them
they
turned
to
meet
the
calm
gaze
of
you
quite
finished
breakfast
sir
philip
he
said
noah
would
be
pleased
to
see
you
in
his
office
too
said
lucy
before
philip
could
say
me
i
suppose
may
come
too
if
you
wish
it
your
highness
said
bowing
stiffly
they
found
noah
very
busy
in
a
little
room
littered
with
papers
he
was
sitting
at
a
table
writing
princess
he
said
sir
philip
you
see
me
very
busy
i
am
trying
to
arrange
for
your
next
labour
you
mean
my
next
deed
of
valour
philip
asked
have
decided
that
all
your
deeds
need
not
be
deeds
of
valour
said
noah
fiddling
with
a
pen
strange
labours
of
hercules
you
remember
were
some
of
them
dangerous
and
some
merely
difficult
i
have
decided
that
difficult
things
shall
count
there
are
several
things
that
really
doing
he
went
on
half
to
himself
the
fruit
supply
and
the
dwellers
by
the
sea
and
but
that
must
wait
we
try
to
give
you
as
much
variety
as
possible
yesterday
was
an
adventure
shall
be
an
indoor
amusement
i
say
but
i
confess
that
i
think
it
not
unlikely
that
the
task
i
am
now
about
to
set
the
candidate
for
the
post
of
the
task
i
say
which
i
am
now
about
to
set
you
may
quite
possibly
occupy
some
days
if
not
weeks
of
your
valuable
time
our
people
at
home
said
philip
is
that
i
afraid
really
and
truly
it
is
but
they
go
out
of
their
minds
not
knowing
what
become
of
us
oh
noah
do
let
us
go
back
all
right
said
noah
long
you
stay
here
time
move
with
them
i
thought
i
explained
that
to
you
you
said
said
you
set
our
clocks
to
the
time
of
world
when
you
deserted
your
little
friend
but
when
you
had
come
back
for
her
and
rescued
her
from
the
dragon
the
clocks
went
their
own
time
again
there
only
just
that
time
missing
that
happened
between
your
coming
here
the
second
time
and
your
killing
the
dragon
see
said
philip
but
he
did
i
only
hope
do
can
take
your
time
about
this
new
job
said
noah
you
may
get
any
help
you
like
i
sha
consider
you
failed
till
you
been
at
it
three
months
after
that
the
pretenderette
would
be
entitled
to
chance
you
quite
sure
that
the
time
here
does
count
at
home
said
philip
is
it
please
that
we
got
to
do
greatest
intellects
of
our
country
have
for
many
ages
occupied
themselves
with
the
problem
which
you
are
now
asked
to
solve
said
noah
late
gaoler
has
written
no
less
than
volumes
all
in
cypher
on
this
very
subject
but
as
he
has
forgotten
what
cypher
he
used
and
no
one
else
ever
knew
it
his
volumes
are
of
but
little
use
to
us
see
said
philip
and
again
he
did
noah
rose
to
his
full
height
and
when
he
stood
up
the
children
looked
very
small
beside
him
he
said
will
tell
you
what
it
is
that
you
must
do
i
should
like
to
decree
that
your
second
labour
should
be
the
tidying
up
of
this
room
these
papers
are
prophecies
relating
to
the
deliverer
but
it
is
one
of
our
laws
that
the
judge
must
not
use
any
public
matter
for
his
own
personal
benefit
so
i
have
decided
that
the
next
labour
shall
be
the
disentangling
of
the
mazy
carpet
it
is
in
the
pillared
hall
of
public
amusements
i
will
get
my
hat
and
we
will
go
there
at
once
i
can
tell
you
about
it
as
we
go
and
as
they
went
down
streets
and
past
houses
and
palaces
all
of
which
philip
could
now
dimly
remember
to
have
built
at
some
time
or
other
noah
went
on
is
a
very
beautiful
hall
but
we
have
never
been
able
to
use
it
for
public
amusement
or
anything
else
the
giant
who
originally
built
this
city
placed
in
this
hall
a
carpet
so
thick
that
it
rises
to
your
knees
and
so
intricately
woven
that
none
can
disentangle
it
it
is
far
too
thick
to
pass
through
any
of
the
doors
it
is
your
task
to
remove
it
that
as
easy
as
easy
said
philip
cut
it
in
bits
and
bring
out
a
bit
at
a
time
would
be
most
unfortunate
for
you
said
noah
filed
only
this
morning
a
very
ancient
prophecy
who
shall
the
carpet
sever
by
fire
or
flint
or
steel
shall
be
fed
on
orange
pips
for
ever
and
dressed
in
orange
peel
you
would
like
that
you
know
said
philip
grimly
certainly
should
carpet
must
be
unwoven
so
that
not
a
thread
is
broken
here
is
the
hall
they
went
up
steps
philip
sometimes
wished
he
had
not
been
so
fond
of
building
steps
and
through
a
dark
vestibule
to
an
arched
door
looking
through
it
they
saw
a
great
hall
and
at
its
end
a
raised
space
more
steps
and
two
enormous
pillars
of
bronze
wrought
in
relief
with
figures
of
flying
birds
japanese
vases
lucy
whispered
the
floor
of
the
room
was
covered
by
the
carpet
it
was
loosely
but
difficultly
woven
of
very
thick
soft
rope
of
a
red
colour
when
i
say
difficultly
i
mean
that
it
was
just
in
the
weaving
but
the
threads
went
over
and
under
and
round
about
in
such
a
determined
and
bewildering
way
that
philip
felt
and
said
that
he
would
rather
untie
the
string
of
a
hundred
of
the
most
difficult
parcels
than
tackle
this
said
noah
leave
you
to
it
board
and
lodging
will
be
provided
at
the
provisional
palace
where
you
slept
last
night
all
citizens
are
bound
to
assist
when
called
upon
dinner
is
at
one
philip
sat
down
in
the
dark
archway
and
gazed
helplessly
at
the
twisted
strands
of
the
carpet
after
a
moment
of
hesitation
lucy
sat
down
too
clasped
her
arms
round
her
knees
and
she
also
gazed
at
the
carpet
they
had
all
the
appearance
of
shipwrecked
mariners
looking
out
over
a
great
sea
and
longing
for
a
sail
ha
tee
hee
said
a
laugh
close
behind
them
they
turned
and
it
was
the
lady
the
hateful
pretenderette
who
had
crept
up
close
behind
them
and
was
looking
down
at
them
through
her
veil
do
you
want
said
philip
severely
want
to
laugh
said
the
motor
lady
want
to
laugh
at
and
i
going
to
go
and
laugh
somewhere
else
then
philip
suggested
but
this
is
where
i
want
to
laugh
you
and
your
carpet
never
do
it
you
do
know
how
but
do
away
whispered
lucy
and
they
went
the
pretenderette
followed
slowly
outside
a
couple
of
dutch
dolls
in
check
suits
were
passing
arm
in
arm
cried
lucy
suddenly
and
the
dutch
dolls
paused
and
took
their
hats
off
is
it
the
taller
doll
asked
stroking
his
black
painted
moustache
noah
said
all
citizens
were
bound
to
help
us
said
lucy
a
little
breathlessly
of
course
said
the
shorter
doll
bowing
with
stiff
courtesy
said
lucy
you
take
that
motor
person
away
and
put
her
somewhere
where
she
ca
bother
till
we
done
the
carpet
exclaimed
the
agreeable
dutch
strangers
darted
up
the
steps
and
next
moment
emerged
with
the
form
of
the
pretenderette
between
them
struggling
indeed
but
struggling
vainly
need
not
have
the
slightest
further
anxiety
the
taller
dutchman
said
the
incident
from
your
mind
we
will
take
her
to
the
hall
of
justice
her
offence
is
bothering
people
in
pursuit
of
their
duty
the
sentence
is
imprisonment
for
as
long
as
the
botheree
chooses
said
both
the
children
together
when
they
were
alone
philip
said
and
it
was
not
easy
to
say
it
was
jolly
clever
of
you
lucy
i
should
never
have
thought
of
it
that
nothing
said
lucy
looking
down
could
do
more
than
that
he
asked
could
unravel
the
carpet
said
lucy
with
deep
solemnity
it
me
that
got
to
do
it
philip
urged
citizen
is
bound
to
help
if
called
in
lucy
reminded
him
i
suppose
a
princess
a
citizen
i
can
do
it
by
myself
said
philip
said
lucy
and
sat
down
on
the
steps
her
fairy
skirts
spreading
out
round
her
like
a
white
double
hollyhock
he
tried
he
went
back
and
looked
at
the
great
coarse
cables
of
the
carpet
he
could
see
no
end
to
the
cables
no
beginning
to
his
task
and
lucy
just
went
on
sitting
there
like
a
white
hollyhock
and
time
went
on
and
presently
became
rather
urgently
so
he
went
back
to
lucy
and
said
right
you
can
show
me
how
to
do
it
if
you
like
but
lucy
replied
much
if
you
want
me
to
help
you
with
you
have
to
promise
to
let
me
help
in
all
the
other
things
and
you
have
to
me
to
help
ask
me
politely
too
sha
then
said
philip
but
in
the
end
he
had
to
politely
also
pleasure
said
lucy
the
moment
he
asked
her
and
he
could
see
she
had
been
making
up
what
she
should
answer
while
he
was
making
up
his
mind
to
ask
shall
be
delighted
to
help
you
in
this
and
all
the
other
tasks
say
yes
said
philip
who
was
very
hungry
in
this
and
all
the
other
tasks
say
this
and
all
the
other
tasks
he
said
on
how
can
we
do
it
lucy
giggled
a
little
crochet
mat
i
made
of
red
wool
and
i
put
it
in
the
hall
that
night
you
just
got
to
find
the
end
and
pull
and
it
all
comes
undone
you
just
want
to
find
the
end
and
pull
too
heavy
for
us
to
pull
said
lucy
who
had
certainly
had
time
to
think
everything
out
get
one
of
those
twisty
round
things
they
pull
boats
out
of
the
sea
with
and
i
find
the
end
while
you
getting
it
she
ran
up
the
steps
and
philip
looked
round
the
buildings
on
the
other
three
sides
of
the
square
to
see
if
any
one
of
them
looked
like
a
capstan
shop
for
he
understood
as
of
course
you
also
have
done
that
a
capstan
was
what
lucy
meant
on
a
building
almost
opposite
he
read
necessaries
supply
company
and
he
ran
across
to
it
said
the
secretary
of
the
company
a
plump
when
philip
had
explained
his
needs
send
a
dozen
men
over
at
once
only
too
proud
to
help
sir
philip
the
navy
is
always
keen
on
helping
valour
and
beauty
want
to
be
brave
said
philip
i
rather
not
be
beautiful
course
not
said
the
secretary
and
added
surprisingly
meant
the
lady
lucy
said
philip
so
twelve
bluejackets
and
a
capstan
outside
the
hall
of
public
amusements
were
soon
the
centre
of
a
cheering
crowd
lucy
had
found
the
end
of
the
rope
and
two
sailors
dragged
it
out
and
attached
it
to
the
capstan
and
then
round
and
round
with
a
will
and
a
breathless
chanty
the
carpet
was
swiftly
unravelled
dozens
of
eager
helpers
stood
on
the
parts
of
the
carpet
which
were
not
being
unravelled
to
keep
it
steady
while
the
pulling
went
on
the
news
of
philip
success
spread
like
through
the
city
and
the
crowds
gathered
thicker
and
thicker
the
great
doors
beyond
the
pillars
with
the
birds
on
them
were
thrown
open
and
noah
and
the
principal
citizens
stood
there
to
see
the
end
of
the
unravelling
said
every
one
in
tremendous
enthusiasm
sir
philip
was
me
said
philip
difficultly
when
the
crowd
paused
for
breath
was
lucy
thought
of
it
bravo
shouted
the
crowd
louder
than
ever
for
the
lady
lucy
bravo
for
sir
philip
the
modest
illustration
so
all
down
the
wide
clear
floor
lucy
danced
my
dear
said
noah
waving
his
hat
and
thumping
lucy
on
the
back
awfully
glad
i
thought
of
it
she
said
makes
two
deeds
sir
philip
done
does
it
two
out
of
the
seven
indeed
said
noah
enthusiastically
must
make
him
a
baronet
now
his
title
will
grow
grander
with
each
deed
there
an
old
prophecy
that
the
person
who
finds
out
how
to
unravel
the
carpet
must
be
the
first
to
dance
in
the
hall
of
public
amusements
clever
one
the
noble
one
who
makes
the
carpet
come
undone
shall
be
the
first
to
dance
a
measure
within
the
hall
of
public
pleasure
i
suppose
public
was
too
difficult
a
rhyme
even
for
these
poets
our
astrologers
you
my
child
seem
to
have
been
well
inspired
in
your
choice
of
a
costume
dance
then
my
lady
lucy
and
let
the
prophecy
be
fulfilled
so
all
down
the
wide
clear
floor
of
the
hall
of
public
amusement
lucy
danced
and
the
people
of
the
city
looked
on
and
applauded
philip
with
the
rest
chapter
vi
the
lions
in
the
desert
why
asked
philip
at
dinner
which
was
no
painted
wonder
of
wooden
but
real
roast
and
angel
pudding
do
you
only
have
wooden
things
to
eat
at
your
banquets
are
extremely
important
occasions
said
noah
real
food
food
that
you
can
eat
and
enjoy
only
serves
to
distract
the
mind
from
the
serious
affairs
of
life
many
of
the
most
successful
caterers
in
your
world
have
grasped
this
great
truth
why
lucy
asked
you
have
the
big
silver
bowls
with
nothing
in
them
noah
sighed
bowls
are
for
dessert
he
said
there
is
any
dessert
them
lucy
objected
said
noah
sighing
again
just
it
there
is
no
dessert
there
has
never
been
any
dessert
will
you
have
a
little
more
angel
pudding
it
was
quite
plain
to
lucy
and
philip
that
noah
wished
to
change
the
subject
which
for
some
reason
was
a
sad
one
and
with
true
politeness
they
both
said
please
to
the
angel
pudding
offer
though
they
had
already
had
quite
as
much
as
they
really
needed
after
dinner
noah
took
them
for
a
walk
through
the
town
see
the
factories
he
said
this
surprised
philip
who
had
been
taught
not
to
build
factories
with
his
bricks
because
factories
were
so
ugly
but
the
factories
turned
out
to
be
pleasant
long
low
houses
with
tall
french
windows
opening
into
gardens
of
roses
where
people
of
all
nations
made
beautiful
and
useful
things
and
loved
making
them
and
all
the
people
who
were
making
them
looked
clean
and
happy
wish
we
had
factories
like
those
philip
said
factories
so
ugly
helen
says
so
because
all
your
factories
are
factories
said
noah
they
called
by
all
sorts
of
different
names
every
one
here
has
to
make
something
that
is
just
money
or
money
something
useful
beautiful
you
said
lucy
i
said
noah
do
you
make
the
question
was
bound
to
come
of
course
noah
answered
in
some
surprise
you
know
i
was
the
chief
judge
laws
ca
be
useful
and
beautiful
can
they
can
certainly
be
useful
said
noah
he
added
with
modest
pride
laws
are
beautiful
what
do
you
think
of
this
everybody
must
try
to
be
kind
to
everybody
else
any
one
who
has
been
unkind
must
be
sorry
and
say
so
seems
all
right
said
philip
it
not
exactly
beautiful
do
you
think
so
said
noah
a
little
hurt
beautiful
perhaps
i
never
could
write
poetry
but
it
quite
beautiful
when
people
do
it
if
you
mean
your
laws
are
beautiful
when
they
said
philip
things
ca
be
beautiful
when
they
broken
of
course
noah
explained
even
laws
but
ugly
laws
are
only
beautiful
when
they
broken
that
odd
is
it
laws
are
very
tricky
things
say
philip
said
suddenly
as
they
climbed
one
of
the
steep
flights
of
steps
between
trees
in
pots
we
do
another
of
the
deeds
now
i
do
feel
as
if
i
really
done
anything
at
all
it
was
lucy
who
did
the
carpet
do
tell
us
the
next
deed
next
deed
noah
answered
probably
take
some
time
there
no
reason
why
you
should
not
begin
it
if
you
like
it
is
a
deed
peculiarly
suited
to
a
baronet
i
do
know
why
he
added
hastily
may
be
that
it
is
the
only
thing
that
baronets
are
good
for
i
should
wonder
the
existence
of
baronets
he
added
musingly
always
seemed
to
the
thoughtful
to
lack
justification
perhaps
this
deed
which
you
will
begin
is
the
wise
end
to
which
baronets
were
designed
i
daresay
said
philip
what
is
the
end
do
know
noah
owned
i
tell
you
what
the
is
you
got
to
journey
to
the
land
of
the
dwellers
by
the
sea
and
by
any
means
that
may
commend
itself
to
you
slay
their
fear
philip
naturally
asked
what
the
dwellers
by
the
sea
were
afraid
of
you
will
learn
from
them
said
noah
it
is
a
very
great
fear
it
something
we
shall
be
afraid
of
lucy
asked
and
philip
at
once
said
then
she
really
did
mean
to
come
did
she
but
she
was
to
if
she
was
afraid
girls
were
expected
to
be
brave
here
said
noah
girls
are
expected
to
be
brave
and
the
boys
kind
said
philip
doubtfully
and
lucy
said
course
i
meant
to
come
you
know
you
promised
so
that
was
settled
now
said
noah
rubbing
his
hands
with
the
cheerful
air
of
one
who
has
a
great
deal
to
do
and
is
going
to
enjoy
doing
it
must
fit
you
out
a
proper
expedition
for
the
dwellers
by
the
sea
are
a
very
long
way
off
what
would
you
like
to
ride
on
horse
said
philip
truly
pleased
he
said
horse
because
he
did
not
want
to
ride
a
donkey
and
he
had
never
seen
any
one
ride
any
animal
but
these
two
right
noah
said
patting
him
on
the
back
so
afraid
you
ask
for
a
bicycle
and
there
a
dreadful
law
here
it
was
made
by
mistake
but
there
it
is
that
if
any
one
asks
for
machinery
they
have
to
have
it
and
keep
on
using
it
but
as
to
a
horse
well
not
sure
you
see
you
have
to
ride
right
across
the
pebbly
waste
and
it
a
good
three
days
journey
but
come
along
to
the
stables
you
know
the
kind
of
stables
they
would
be
the
long
shed
with
stalls
such
as
you
had
when
you
were
little
for
your
little
wooden
horses
and
carts
only
there
were
not
only
horses
here
but
every
sort
of
animal
that
has
ever
been
ridden
on
elephants
camels
donkeys
mules
bulls
goats
zebras
tortoises
ostriches
bisons
and
pigs
and
in
the
last
stall
of
all
which
was
not
of
common
wood
but
of
beaten
silver
stood
the
very
hippogriff
himself
with
his
long
white
mane
and
his
long
white
tail
and
his
gentle
beautiful
eyes
his
long
white
wings
were
folded
neatly
on
his
back
and
how
he
and
the
stall
got
here
was
more
than
philip
could
guess
all
the
others
were
noah
ark
animals
alive
of
course
but
still
noah
arky
beyond
possibility
of
mistake
but
the
hippogriff
was
not
noah
ark
at
all
came
noah
explained
of
a
book
one
of
the
books
you
used
to
build
your
city
with
we
have
lucy
said
looks
such
a
darling
and
the
hippogriff
turned
his
white
velvet
nose
and
nuzzled
against
her
in
affectionate
acknowledgment
of
the
compliment
if
you
both
go
noah
explained
can
not
carry
more
than
one
person
at
a
time
unless
one
is
an
earl
no
if
i
may
advise
i
should
say
go
by
camel
the
camel
carry
two
course
he
is
called
the
ship
of
the
desert
noah
informed
them
a
ship
that
would
carry
more
than
one
would
be
simply
silly
so
was
settled
noah
himself
saddled
and
bridled
the
camel
which
was
a
very
large
one
with
his
own
hands
me
see
he
said
standing
thoughtful
with
the
lead
rope
in
his
hand
be
wanting
dogs
want
dogs
said
philip
to
use
in
emergencies
he
whistled
and
two
noah
ark
dogs
leaped
from
their
kennels
to
their
chains
end
they
were
dachshunds
very
long
and
low
and
very
alike
except
that
one
was
a
little
bigger
and
a
little
browner
than
the
other
is
your
master
and
that
your
mistress
noah
explained
to
the
dogs
and
they
fawned
round
the
children
you
want
things
to
eat
and
things
to
drink
and
tents
and
umbrellas
in
case
of
bad
weather
and
but
let
turn
down
this
street
just
at
the
corner
we
shall
find
exactly
what
we
want
it
was
a
shop
that
said
outside
provider
expeditions
fitted
out
at
a
moment
notice
punctuality
and
dispatch
the
shopkeeper
came
forward
politely
he
was
so
exactly
like
noah
that
the
children
knew
who
he
was
even
before
he
said
father
and
noah
said
is
my
son
he
has
had
some
experience
in
outfits
have
you
got
to
start
with
the
son
asked
getting
to
business
at
once
dogs
two
children
and
a
camel
said
noah
i
know
customary
to
have
two
of
everything
but
i
assure
you
my
dear
boy
that
one
camel
is
as
much
as
sir
philip
can
manage
it
is
indeed
noah
son
very
dutifully
supposed
that
his
father
knew
best
and
willingly
agreed
to
provide
everything
that
was
needed
for
the
expedition
including
one
talking
parrot
and
to
deliver
all
goods
carefully
packed
within
half
an
hour
so
now
you
see
philip
and
lucy
who
still
wore
her
fairy
dress
packed
with
all
their
belongings
on
the
top
of
a
very
large
and
wobbly
camel
and
being
led
out
of
the
city
by
the
usual
procession
with
seven
bands
of
music
all
playing
the
conquering
hero
goes
quite
a
different
tune
from
the
one
you
know
which
has
a
name
a
little
like
that
the
camel
and
its
load
were
rather
a
tight
fit
for
the
particular
gateway
that
they
happened
to
go
out
by
and
the
children
had
to
stoop
to
avoid
scraping
their
heads
against
the
top
of
the
arch
but
they
got
through
all
right
and
now
they
were
well
on
the
road
which
was
really
little
more
than
a
field
path
running
through
the
flowery
meadow
country
where
the
dragon
had
been
killed
they
saw
the
stonehenge
ruins
and
the
big
tower
far
away
to
the
left
and
in
front
lay
the
vast
and
interesting
expanse
of
the
absolutely
unknown
the
sun
was
shining
there
was
a
sun
and
noah
had
told
the
children
that
it
came
out
of
the
poetry
books
together
with
rain
and
flowers
and
the
changing
seasons
and
in
spite
of
the
strange
way
in
which
the
camel
walked
the
two
travellers
were
very
happy
the
dogs
bounded
along
in
the
best
of
spirits
and
even
the
camel
seemed
less
a
prey
than
usual
to
that
proud
melancholy
which
you
must
have
noticed
in
your
visits
to
the
zoo
as
his
most
striking
quality
it
was
certainly
very
grand
to
ride
on
a
camel
and
lucy
tried
not
to
think
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
get
on
and
off
the
parrot
was
interesting
too
it
talked
extremely
well
of
course
you
understand
that
if
you
can
only
make
a
parrot
understand
it
can
tell
you
everything
you
want
to
know
about
other
animals
because
it
understands
talk
quite
naturally
and
without
being
made
the
present
parrot
declined
ordinary
conversation
and
when
questioned
only
recited
poetry
of
a
rather
dull
kind
that
went
on
and
on
and
the
man
i
sing
it
began
and
then
something
about
haughty
juno
its
voice
was
soothing
and
riding
on
the
camel
was
not
unlike
being
rocked
in
a
very
bumpety
cradle
the
children
were
securely
seated
in
things
like
padded
panniers
and
they
had
had
an
exciting
day
as
the
sun
set
which
it
did
quite
soon
the
parrot
called
out
to
the
nearest
dog
say
max
they
asleep
illustration
on
the
top
of
a
very
large
and
wobbly
camel
do
wonder
said
max
it
all
right
humpty
knows
the
way
a
civil
tongue
in
your
head
you
young
dog
ca
you
said
the
camel
grumpily
be
cross
darling
said
the
other
dog
whose
name
was
brenda
be
sure
you
stop
at
a
really
oasis
for
the
night
but
i
know
we
can
trust
dear
the
camel
muttered
that
it
was
all
very
well
but
his
voice
was
not
quite
as
cross
as
before
after
that
the
expedition
went
on
in
silence
through
the
deepening
twilight
a
tumbling
shaking
dumping
sensation
more
like
a
soft
railway
accident
than
anything
else
awakened
our
travellers
and
they
found
that
the
camel
was
kneeling
down
you
come
said
the
parrot
make
the
fire
and
boil
the
kettle
put
the
kettle
on
lucy
said
absently
as
she
slid
down
to
the
ground
to
which
the
parrot
replied
not
i
wish
you
rake
up
that
old
story
it
was
quite
false
i
never
did
put
a
kettle
on
and
i
never
will
why
should
i
describe
to
you
the
adventure
of
camping
at
an
oasis
in
a
desert
you
must
all
have
done
it
many
times
or
if
you
have
not
done
it
you
have
read
about
it
you
know
all
about
the
well
and
the
palm
trees
and
the
dates
and
things
they
had
cocoa
for
supper
it
was
great
fun
and
they
slept
soundly
and
awoke
in
the
morning
with
a
heart
for
any
fate
as
a
respectable
poet
puts
it
the
next
day
was
just
the
same
as
the
first
only
instead
of
going
through
fresh
green
fields
the
way
lay
through
dry
yellow
desert
and
again
the
children
slept
and
again
the
camel
chose
an
oasis
with
remarkable
taste
and
judgment
but
the
second
night
was
not
at
all
the
same
as
the
first
for
in
the
middle
of
it
the
parrot
awakened
philip
by
biting
his
ear
and
then
hopping
to
a
safe
distance
from
his
awakening
fists
and
crying
out
up
the
camp
fire
look
alive
it
lions
the
dogs
were
whining
and
barking
and
brenda
was
earnestly
trying
to
climb
a
palm
tree
max
faced
the
danger
it
is
true
but
he
seemed
to
have
no
real
love
of
sport
philip
sprang
up
and
heaped
dead
palm
scales
and
leaves
on
the
dying
fire
it
blazed
up
and
something
moved
beyond
the
bushes
philip
wondered
whether
those
pairs
of
shining
things
like
strayed
stars
that
he
saw
in
the
darkness
could
really
be
the
eyes
of
lions
a
nuisance
these
lions
are
to
be
sure
said
the
parrot
they
wo
come
near
us
while
the
fire
burning
but
really
they
ought
to
be
put
down
by
law
does
somebody
kill
them
lucy
asked
she
had
wakened
when
philip
did
and
after
a
meditative
minute
had
helped
with
the
palm
scales
and
things
not
so
easy
said
the
parrot
knows
how
to
do
it
how
would
kill
a
lion
do
know
said
philip
but
lucy
said
they
noah
ark
lions
course
they
are
said
polly
the
books
with
lions
in
them
are
kept
shut
up
know
how
you
could
kill
noah
ark
lions
if
you
could
catch
them
lucy
said
easy
enough
to
catch
them
said
polly
hour
after
dawn
they
go
to
sleep
but
it
unsportsmanlike
to
kill
game
when
it
asleep
going
to
think
if
you
do
mind
lucy
announced
and
sat
down
very
near
the
fire
just
the
opposite
of
the
dragon
she
said
after
a
minute
the
parrot
nodded
and
there
was
a
long
silence
then
suddenly
lucy
jumped
up
know
she
cried
i
really
know
and
it
wo
hurt
them
either
i
do
a
bit
mind
killing
things
but
i
do
hate
hurting
them
there
plenty
of
rope
i
know
there
was
when
it
dawn
we
tie
them
up
and
then
you
see
think
you
might
tell
said
philip
injured
they
may
understand
what
we
say
polly
does
philip
made
a
natural
suggestion
but
lucy
replied
that
it
was
not
manners
to
whisper
and
the
parrot
said
that
it
should
think
not
indeed
so
sitting
by
the
fire
all
faces
turned
to
where
those
strange
twin
stars
shone
and
those
strange
hidden
movements
and
rustlings
stirred
the
expedition
waited
for
the
dawn
brenda
had
given
up
the
idea
and
was
cuddling
up
as
close
to
lucy
as
possible
the
camel
who
had
been
trembling
with
fear
all
the
while
tried
to
cuddle
up
to
philip
which
would
have
been
easier
if
it
had
been
a
smaller
kind
instead
of
being
as
it
was
what
noah
son
the
universal
provider
had
called
out
size
in
camels
and
presently
dawn
came
not
slow
and
silvery
as
dawns
come
here
but
sudden
and
red
with
strong
level
lights
and
the
shadows
of
the
palm
trees
stretching
all
across
the
desert
in
broad
daylight
it
did
not
seem
so
hard
to
have
to
go
and
look
for
the
lions
they
all
went
even
the
camel
pulled
himself
together
to
join
the
and
brenda
herself
decided
to
come
rather
than
be
left
alone
the
lions
were
easily
found
there
were
only
two
of
them
of
course
and
they
were
lying
close
together
each
on
its
tawny
side
on
the
sandy
desert
at
the
edge
of
the
oasis
very
gently
the
ropes
with
slip
knots
were
fitted
over
their
heads
and
the
other
end
of
the
rope
passed
round
a
palm
tree
other
ropes
round
the
trees
were
passed
round
what
would
have
been
the
waists
of
the
lions
if
lions
had
such
things
as
waists
whispered
lucy
and
at
once
all
four
ropes
were
pulled
tight
the
lions
struggled
but
only
in
their
sleep
and
soon
they
were
still
then
with
more
and
more
ropes
their
legs
and
tails
were
made
fast
that
all
right
said
lucy
rather
out
of
breath
polly
replied
that
bird
from
a
neighbouring
bush
thought
i
should
only
be
in
the
way
if
i
kept
close
to
you
but
i
longed
to
lend
a
claw
in
such
good
work
can
i
help
you
please
explain
to
the
dogs
said
lucy
their
turn
now
the
only
way
i
know
to
kill
noah
ark
lions
is
to
the
paint
and
break
their
legs
and
if
the
dogs
lick
all
the
paint
off
their
legs
they
wo
feel
it
when
we
break
them
polly
hastened
to
explain
to
the
dogs
and
then
turned
again
to
lucy
asked
if
you
sure
the
ropes
will
hold
and
i
told
them
of
course
so
now
they
going
to
begin
i
only
hope
the
paint
wo
make
them
never
did
me
said
lucy
sucked
the
dove
quite
clean
one
sunday
and
it
was
half
bad
tasted
of
sugar
a
little
and
eucalyptus
oil
like
they
give
you
when
you
got
a
cold
tell
them
that
polly
polly
did
and
added
will
recite
poetry
to
them
to
hearten
them
to
their
task
said
philip
heartily
may
make
them
hurry
up
but
perhaps
you
better
tell
them
that
we
shall
pinch
their
tails
if
they
happen
to
go
to
sleep
then
the
children
had
a
breakfast
all
expeditions
seem
to
live
mostly
on
cocoa
and
when
they
come
back
they
often
write
to
the
cocoa
makers
to
say
how
good
it
was
and
they
do
know
what
they
would
have
done
without
it
and
the
noble
and
devoted
dogs
licked
and
licked
and
licked
and
the
paint
began
to
come
off
the
lions
legs
like
anything
it
was
heavy
work
turning
the
lions
over
so
as
to
get
at
the
other
or
unlicked
side
but
the
expedition
worked
with
a
will
and
the
lions
resisted
but
feebly
being
still
asleep
and
besides
weak
from
loss
of
paint
and
the
dogs
had
a
drink
given
them
and
were
patted
and
praised
and
set
to
work
again
and
they
licked
and
licked
for
hours
and
hours
and
in
the
end
all
the
paint
was
off
the
lions
legs
and
philip
chopped
them
off
with
the
explorer
axe
which
that
experienced
provider
noah
son
had
thoughtfully
included
in
the
outfit
of
the
expedition
and
as
he
chopped
the
chips
flew
and
lucy
picked
one
up
and
it
was
just
wood
and
nothing
else
though
when
they
had
tied
it
up
it
had
been
real
writhing
resisting
and
no
mistake
and
when
all
the
legs
were
chopped
off
philip
put
his
hand
on
a
lion
body
and
that
was
wood
too
so
the
lions
were
dead
indeed
illustration
it
was
heavy
work
turning
the
lions
over
seems
a
pity
he
said
are
such
jolly
beasts
when
they
are
alive
never
cared
for
lions
myself
said
polly
and
lucy
said
mind
phil
it
did
hurt
them
anyway
and
that
was
the
first
time
she
ever
called
him
phil
right
lu
said
philip
was
jolly
clever
of
you
to
think
of
it
anyhow
and
that
was
the
first
time
he
ever
called
her
lu
they
saw
the
straight
pale
line
of
the
sea
for
a
long
time
before
they
came
to
the
place
of
the
dwellers
by
the
sea
for
these
people
had
built
their
castle
down
on
the
very
edge
of
the
sea
and
the
pebbly
waste
rose
and
rose
to
a
mountain
that
hid
their
castle
from
the
eyes
of
the
who
were
now
drawing
near
to
the
scene
of
their
next
deed
the
pebbly
waste
was
all
made
of
small
slippery
stones
and
the
children
understood
how
horrid
a
horse
would
have
found
it
even
the
camel
went
very
slowly
and
the
dogs
no
longer
frisked
and
bounded
but
went
at
a
foot
pace
with
drooping
ears
and
tails
should
call
a
halt
if
i
were
you
said
polly
shall
all
be
the
better
for
a
cup
of
cocoa
and
besides
polly
refused
to
explain
this
dark
hint
and
only
added
out
for
surprises
thought
said
philip
draining
the
last
of
his
second
mug
of
cocoa
thought
there
were
no
birds
in
the
desert
except
you
and
you
more
a
person
than
a
bird
but
look
there
far
away
across
the
desert
a
moving
speck
showed
high
up
in
the
blue
air
it
grew
bigger
and
bigger
plainly
coming
towards
the
camp
it
was
as
big
as
a
moth
now
now
as
big
as
a
teacup
now
as
big
as
an
eagle
and
it
got
four
legs
said
lucy
said
the
parrot
would
have
you
know
it
is
the
hippogriff
it
was
indeed
that
magnificent
wonder
flying
through
the
air
with
long
sweeps
of
his
great
white
wings
the
hippogriff
drew
nearer
and
nearer
bearing
on
his
back
what
the
pretenderette
cried
lucy
and
at
the
same
moment
philip
said
that
nasty
motor
thing
it
was
the
hippogriff
dropped
from
the
sky
to
the
desert
below
as
softly
as
a
butterfly
alighting
on
a
flower
and
stood
there
in
all
his
gracious
whiteness
and
on
his
back
was
the
veiled
motor
lady
glad
i
caught
you
up
she
said
in
that
hateful
voice
of
hers
we
can
go
on
together
do
see
what
you
wanted
to
come
at
all
for
said
philip
downrightly
you
she
said
sitting
up
there
on
the
hippogriff
with
her
horrid
motor
veil
fluttering
in
the
breeze
from
the
now
hidden
sea
of
course
i
have
a
right
to
be
present
at
all
experiments
there
ought
to
be
some
responsible
person
to
see
that
you
really
do
what
you
sure
to
say
you
done
you
mean
that
we
liars
philip
asked
hotly
do
mean
to
anything
about
it
the
pretenderette
answered
with
an
unpleasant
giggle
a
person
ought
to
be
present
she
added
something
about
a
parcel
of
birds
and
children
and
the
parrot
ruffled
his
feathers
till
he
looked
twice
his
proper
size
philip
said
he
did
see
it
but
do
said
the
pretenderette
you
fail
then
it
my
turn
and
i
might
very
likely
succeed
the
minute
after
you
failed
so
we
all
go
on
comfortably
together
that
be
nice
a
speechless
despair
seemed
to
have
fallen
on
the
party
nobody
spoke
the
children
looked
blank
the
dogs
whined
the
camel
put
on
his
haughtiest
sneer
and
the
parrot
fidgeted
in
his
feather
dress
be
starting
said
the
motor
lady
pony
a
shiver
ran
through
every
one
present
that
a
pretenderette
should
dare
to
speak
so
to
a
hippogriff
suddenly
the
parrot
spread
its
wings
and
flew
to
perch
on
shoulder
it
whispered
in
his
ear
is
not
manners
i
know
it
said
your
own
generous
heart
will
excuse
me
parcel
of
birds
and
children
does
your
blood
boil
philip
thought
it
did
then
said
the
bird
impatiently
are
we
waiting
for
you
only
got
to
say
the
word
and
i
take
her
back
by
the
ear
wish
you
would
said
philip
from
the
heart
easier
said
the
parrot
miserable
outsider
intruding
into
expedition
i
advise
you
to
await
my
return
here
or
if
i
am
not
back
by
the
morning
there
will
be
no
objection
to
your
calling
about
noon
on
the
dwellers
i
can
rejoin
you
there
it
stroked
his
ear
with
a
gentle
and
kindly
beak
and
flew
into
the
air
and
circled
three
times
round
the
detested
motor
lady
head
away
she
cried
flapping
her
hands
furiously
your
silly
off
ca
you
and
then
she
screamed
it
got
hold
of
my
ear
do
hurt
her
said
lucy
will
not
hurt
her
the
parrot
let
the
ear
go
on
purpose
to
say
this
and
the
pretenderette
covered
both
ears
with
her
hands
person
in
the
veil
i
shall
take
hold
again
in
a
moment
and
it
will
hurt
you
much
less
if
the
hippogriff
and
i
happen
to
be
flying
in
the
same
direction
see
if
i
were
you
i
should
just
say
go
back
the
way
you
came
please
to
the
hippogriff
and
then
i
shall
hardly
hurt
you
at
all
do
think
of
getting
off
if
you
do
the
dogs
will
have
you
keep
your
hands
over
your
ears
if
you
like
i
know
you
can
hear
me
well
enough
now
i
am
going
to
take
hold
of
you
again
keep
your
hands
where
they
are
i
not
particular
to
an
ear
or
so
a
nose
will
do
just
as
well
the
person
on
the
hippogriff
put
both
hands
to
her
nose
instantly
the
parrot
had
her
again
by
the
ear
back
the
way
you
came
she
cried
i
be
even
with
you
children
yet
the
hippogriff
did
not
move
go
my
ear
screamed
the
lady
have
to
say
please
you
know
said
philip
to
the
bird
i
do
mean
that
that
no
good
but
to
the
hippogriff
then
said
the
lady
in
a
burst
of
temper
and
instantly
the
white
wings
parted
and
spread
and
the
hippogriff
rose
in
the
air
polly
let
the
ear
go
for
the
moment
to
say
sha
hurt
her
so
long
as
she
behaves
and
then
took
hold
again
and
his
little
grey
wings
and
the
big
white
wings
of
the
hippogriff
went
sailing
away
across
the
desert
a
treasure
of
a
parrot
said
philip
but
lucy
said
that
pretenderette
why
is
she
so
horrid
to
us
when
every
one
else
is
so
nice
do
know
said
philip
old
thing
ca
help
feeling
as
if
i
knew
her
quite
well
if
i
could
only
remember
who
she
is
you
said
philip
say
let
play
noughts
and
crosses
i
got
a
notebook
and
a
bit
of
pencil
in
my
pocket
we
might
play
till
time
to
go
to
sleep
so
they
played
noughts
and
crosses
on
the
pebbly
waste
and
behind
them
the
parrot
and
the
hippogriff
took
away
the
tiresome
one
and
in
front
of
them
lay
the
high
pebble
ridge
that
was
like
a
mountain
and
beyond
that
was
the
unknown
and
the
adventure
and
the
dwellers
and
the
deed
to
be
done
chapter
vii
the
dwellers
by
the
sea
you
soon
get
used
to
things
it
seemed
quite
natural
and
homelike
to
philip
to
be
wakened
in
bright
early
morning
by
the
gentle
beak
of
the
parrot
at
his
ear
got
back
all
right
then
he
said
sleepily
was
rather
a
long
journey
said
the
parrot
i
thought
it
better
to
come
back
by
wing
the
hippogriff
offered
to
bring
me
he
is
the
soul
of
courteous
gentleness
but
he
was
tired
too
the
pretenderette
is
in
gaol
for
the
moment
but
i
afraid
she
get
out
again
we
so
unused
to
having
prisoners
you
see
and
it
no
use
putting
on
her
honour
because
she
has
any
philip
finished
would
say
said
the
parrot
anybody
i
only
say
we
have
come
across
it
what
about
breakfast
meals
do
keep
happening
said
lucy
yawning
seems
only
a
few
minutes
since
supper
and
yet
here
we
are
hungry
again
said
the
parrot
what
people
always
feel
when
they
have
to
get
their
meals
themselves
when
the
camel
and
the
dogs
had
been
served
with
breakfast
the
children
and
the
parrot
sat
down
to
eat
and
there
were
many
questions
to
ask
the
parrot
answered
some
and
some
it
did
answer
there
one
thing
said
lucy
do
most
awfully
want
to
know
about
the
hippogriff
how
did
it
get
out
of
the
book
a
long
story
said
the
parrot
i
tell
it
shortly
that
a
very
good
rule
tell
short
stories
longly
and
long
stories
shortly
many
years
ago
in
repairing
one
of
the
buildings
the
masons
removed
the
supports
of
one
of
the
books
which
are
part
of
the
architecture
the
book
fell
it
fell
open
and
out
came
the
hippogriff
then
they
saw
something
struggling
under
the
next
page
and
lifted
it
and
out
came
a
megatherium
so
they
shut
the
book
and
built
it
into
the
wall
again
how
did
the
megawhatsitsname
and
the
hippogriff
come
to
be
the
proper
size
that
one
of
the
eleven
mysteries
some
sages
suppose
that
the
country
gave
itself
a
sort
of
shake
and
everything
settled
down
into
the
size
it
ought
to
be
i
think
myself
that
it
the
air
the
moment
you
breathe
this
enchanted
air
you
become
the
right
size
did
you
know
why
did
they
shut
the
book
was
a
book
of
beasts
who
knows
what
might
have
come
out
next
a
tiger
perhaps
and
ravening
for
its
prey
as
likely
as
not
see
said
philip
of
course
beasts
were
really
because
of
there
being
all
the
noah
ark
ones
said
the
parrot
they
shut
the
book
the
weather
came
out
of
books
was
another
book
a
poetry
book
it
had
only
one
cover
so
everything
that
was
on
the
last
page
got
out
naturally
we
got
a
lot
out
of
that
page
rain
and
sun
and
sky
and
clouds
mountains
gardens
roses
lilies
flowers
in
general
blossoms
of
delight
they
were
called
in
the
book
and
trees
and
the
sea
and
the
desert
and
silver
and
iron
as
much
of
all
of
them
as
anybody
could
possibly
want
there
are
no
limits
to
poets
imaginations
you
know
see
said
lucy
and
took
a
large
bite
of
cake
where
did
you
come
from
polly
dear
said
the
parrot
modestly
out
of
the
same
book
as
the
hippogriff
we
were
on
the
same
page
my
wings
entitled
me
to
associate
with
him
of
course
but
i
have
sometimes
thought
they
just
put
me
in
as
a
contrast
my
smallness
his
greatness
my
red
and
green
his
white
see
said
lucy
again
please
will
you
tell
us
of
this
said
the
parrot
before
pleasure
you
have
begun
the
day
with
the
pleasures
of
my
conversation
you
will
have
to
work
very
hard
to
pay
for
this
privilege
so
they
washed
up
the
breakfast
things
in
warm
water
obligingly
provided
by
the
camel
now
said
the
parrot
must
pack
up
and
go
on
our
way
to
destroy
the
fear
of
the
dwellers
by
the
sea
wonder
brenda
said
to
max
in
an
undertone
wonder
whether
it
would
be
best
for
dear
little
dogs
to
lose
themselves
we
could
turn
up
later
and
be
so
glad
to
be
found
why
max
asked
noticed
said
brenda
sidling
up
to
him
with
eager
affectionateness
wherever
there
fear
there
something
to
be
afraid
of
even
if
it
only
your
fancy
it
would
be
dreadful
for
dear
little
dogs
to
be
afraid
max
would
it
so
undignified
dear
said
max
heavily
could
give
seven
noble
reasons
for
being
faithful
to
our
master
but
i
will
only
give
you
one
there
is
nothing
to
eat
in
the
desert
and
nothing
to
drink
always
were
so
noble
dearest
said
brenda
different
from
poor
little
me
i
only
my
affectionate
nature
i
know
i
only
a
silly
little
thing
so
when
the
camel
lurched
forward
and
the
parrot
took
wing
the
dogs
followed
closely
faithful
things
said
lucy
max
nice
dogs
and
the
dogs
politely
responding
bounded
enthusiastically
the
journey
was
not
long
quite
soon
they
found
a
sort
of
ravine
or
gully
in
the
cliff
and
a
path
that
led
through
it
and
then
they
were
on
the
beach
very
pebbly
with
small
stones
and
there
was
the
home
of
the
dwellers
by
the
sea
and
beyond
it
broad
and
blue
and
beautiful
the
sea
by
which
they
dwelt
the
dwelling
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
town
of
rounded
buildings
more
like
than
anything
else
with
arched
doors
leading
to
dark
insides
they
were
all
built
of
tiny
stones
such
as
lay
on
the
beach
beyond
the
huts
or
houses
towered
the
castle
a
vast
rough
structure
with
towers
and
arches
and
buttresses
and
bastions
and
glacis
and
bridges
and
a
great
moat
all
round
it
i
never
built
a
city
like
that
did
you
lucy
asked
as
they
drew
near
philip
answered
least
do
you
know
i
do
believe
it
the
sand
castle
helen
and
i
built
last
summer
at
dymchurch
and
those
huts
are
the
moulds
i
made
of
my
pail
with
the
edges
worn
off
you
know
towards
the
castle
the
travellers
advanced
the
camel
lurching
like
a
boat
on
a
rough
sea
and
the
dogs
going
with
delicacy
over
the
stones
they
skirted
large
pools
and
tall
rocks
seaweed
covered
along
a
road
broad
enough
for
twelve
chariots
to
have
driven
on
it
abreast
slowly
they
came
to
the
great
gate
of
the
castle
and
as
they
got
nearer
they
saw
at
every
window
heads
leaning
out
every
battlement
every
terrace
was
crowded
with
figures
and
when
they
were
quite
near
by
throwing
their
heads
very
far
back
so
that
their
necks
felt
quite
stiff
for
quite
a
long
time
afterwards
the
children
could
see
that
all
those
people
seemed
quite
young
and
seemed
to
have
very
odd
and
delightful
clothes
just
a
garment
from
shoulder
to
knee
made
as
it
seemed
of
dark
fur
illustration
slowly
they
came
to
the
great
gate
of
the
castle
lots
of
them
there
are
said
philip
did
they
come
from
of
a
book
said
the
parrot
the
authorities
were
very
prompt
that
time
only
a
line
and
a
half
got
out
troops
of
gentle
islanders
those
are
the
islanders
why
asked
philip
naturally
they
on
an
island
only
one
island
and
no
one
is
allowed
on
that
except
two
people
who
never
go
there
but
the
islanders
are
happy
even
if
they
do
live
on
an
island
always
happy
except
for
the
great
fear
here
the
travellers
began
to
cross
one
of
the
bridges
across
the
moat
the
bridge
in
fact
which
led
to
the
biggest
arch
of
all
it
was
a
very
rough
arch
like
the
entrance
to
a
cave
and
from
out
its
dark
mouth
came
a
little
crowd
of
people
savages
said
lucy
shrinking
till
she
seemed
only
an
extra
hump
on
the
camel
back
they
were
indeed
of
a
dark
complexion
sunburnt
in
fact
but
their
faces
were
handsome
and
kindly
they
waved
friendly
hands
and
smiled
in
the
most
agreeable
and
welcoming
way
the
tallest
islander
stepped
out
from
the
crowd
he
was
about
as
big
as
philip
not
savages
said
philip
be
a
donkey
they
just
children
said
the
parrot
lord
high
islander
is
now
about
to
begin
the
state
address
of
welcome
he
was
and
this
was
the
address
jolly
of
you
to
come
do
get
down
off
that
camel
and
come
indoors
and
have
some
grub
jim
you
might
take
that
camel
round
to
the
stable
and
rub
him
down
a
bit
you
like
to
keep
the
dogs
with
you
of
course
and
what
about
the
parrot
awfully
philip
responded
and
slid
off
the
camel
followed
by
lucy
parrot
will
make
his
own
mind
up
he
always
does
they
all
trooped
into
the
hall
of
the
castle
which
was
more
like
a
cave
than
a
hall
and
very
dark
for
the
windows
were
little
and
high
up
as
lucy
eyes
got
used
to
the
light
she
perceived
that
the
clothes
of
the
islanders
were
not
of
skins
but
of
seaweed
asked
you
in
said
the
lord
high
islander
a
boy
of
about
philip
age
of
politeness
but
really
it
is
dinner
time
and
the
meet
is
in
half
an
hour
so
unless
you
really
hungry
the
children
said
at
all
hunt
of
course
the
lord
high
islander
said
really
the
only
sport
we
get
here
except
fishing
of
course
we
play
games
and
all
that
i
do
hope
you
wo
be
dull
came
here
on
business
the
parrot
remarked
and
the
happy
islanders
crowded
round
to
see
him
remarking
are
philip
and
lucy
claimants
to
the
deliverership
they
are
doing
their
deeds
you
know
the
parrot
ended
lucy
whispered
really
who
is
the
claimant
not
me
only
the
parrot
so
polite
the
lord
high
islander
frowned
can
talk
about
that
afterwards
he
said
a
pity
to
waste
time
now
do
you
hunt
philip
asked
the
different
kinds
of
graibeeste
and
the
vertoblancs
and
the
blugraiwee
when
we
can
find
him
said
the
lord
high
islander
he
very
scarce
pinkuggers
are
more
common
and
much
bigger
of
course
well
you
soon
see
if
your
camel
not
quite
fresh
i
can
mount
you
both
what
kind
of
animal
do
you
prefer
do
you
ride
philip
asked
it
appeared
that
the
lord
high
islander
rode
a
giraffe
and
philip
longed
to
ride
another
but
lucy
said
she
would
rather
ride
what
she
was
used
to
thank
you
when
they
got
out
into
the
courtyard
of
the
castle
they
found
it
full
of
a
crowd
of
animals
any
of
which
you
may
find
in
the
zoo
or
in
your
old
noah
ark
if
it
was
a
sufficiently
expensive
one
to
begin
with
and
if
you
have
not
broken
or
lost
too
many
of
the
inhabitants
each
animal
had
its
rider
and
the
party
rode
out
on
to
the
beach
it
they
hunt
philip
asked
the
parrot
who
had
perched
on
his
shoulder
the
little
animals
in
the
noah
ark
that
have
any
names
the
parrot
told
him
those
are
considered
fair
game
hullo
blugraiwee
it
shouted
as
a
little
grey
beast
with
blue
spots
started
from
the
shelter
of
a
rock
and
made
for
the
cover
of
a
patch
of
giant
seaweed
then
all
sorts
of
little
animals
got
up
and
scurried
off
into
places
of
security
goes
a
vertoblanc
said
the
parrot
pointing
to
a
bright
green
animal
of
uncertain
shape
whose
breast
and
paws
were
white
there
a
graibeeste
the
graibeeste
was
about
as
big
as
a
fox
and
had
rabbit
ears
and
the
unusual
distinction
of
a
tail
coming
out
of
his
back
just
between
one
end
of
him
and
the
other
but
there
are
graibeestes
of
all
sorts
and
shapes
illustration
your
camel
not
quite
fresh
i
can
mount
you
both
you
know
when
people
are
making
the
animals
for
noah
arks
they
make
the
big
ones
first
elephants
and
lions
and
tigers
and
so
on
and
paint
them
as
nearly
as
they
can
the
right
colours
then
they
get
weary
of
copying
nature
and
begin
to
paint
the
animals
pink
and
green
and
chocolate
colour
which
in
nature
is
not
the
case
these
are
the
chockmunks
and
vertoblancs
and
the
pinkuggers
and
presently
the
makers
get
sick
of
the
whole
business
and
make
the
animals
any
sort
of
shape
and
paint
them
all
one
grey
these
are
the
graibeestes
and
at
the
very
end
a
guilty
feeling
of
having
been
slackers
comes
over
the
makers
of
the
noah
arks
and
they
paint
blue
spots
on
the
last
and
littlest
of
the
graibeestes
to
ease
their
consciences
this
is
the
blugraiwee
ho
hark
forrad
yoicks
were
some
of
the
observations
now
to
be
heard
on
every
side
as
the
hunt
swept
on
the
blugraiwee
well
ahead
dogs
yapped
animals
galloped
riders
shouted
the
sun
shone
the
sea
sparkled
and
far
ahead
the
blugraiwee
ran
extended
to
his
full
length
like
a
grey
straight
line
he
was
killed
five
miles
from
the
castle
after
a
splendid
run
and
when
a
pinkugger
had
been
secured
and
half
a
dozen
graibeeste
the
hunt
rode
slowly
home
only
hunt
to
kill
and
we
only
kill
for
food
the
lord
high
islander
said
said
philip
thought
noah
ark
animals
turned
into
wood
when
they
were
dead
if
you
kill
for
food
the
intention
makes
all
the
difference
i
had
a
intention
when
we
put
up
the
blugraiwee
the
pinkugger
i
made
a
bread
and
butter
intention
about
and
the
graibeestes
i
intended
for
rice
pudding
and
prunes
and
toffee
and
ices
and
all
sorts
of
odd
things
so
of
course
when
we
come
to
cut
them
up
they
what
i
intended
see
said
philip
jogging
along
on
his
camel
say
he
added
do
mind
my
asking
how
is
it
you
all
children
here
said
the
lord
high
islander
ancient
history
so
i
suppose
it
true
but
they
say
that
when
the
government
had
to
make
sure
that
we
should
always
be
troops
of
gentle
islanders
they
decided
that
the
only
way
was
for
us
to
be
children
and
we
do
have
the
most
ripping
time
and
we
do
our
own
hunting
and
cooking
and
wash
up
our
own
plates
and
things
and
for
heavy
work
we
have
the
men
who
had
to
work
at
sums
and
history
and
things
at
college
so
hard
that
they
want
a
holiday
so
they
come
here
and
work
for
us
and
if
any
of
us
do
want
to
learn
anything
the
are
handy
to
have
about
the
place
it
pleases
them
to
teach
anything
poor
things
they
live
in
the
huts
there
always
a
long
list
waiting
for
their
turn
oh
yes
they
wear
the
seaweed
dress
the
same
as
we
do
and
they
hunt
on
tuesdays
thursdays
and
saturdays
they
hunt
big
game
the
fierce
ambergris
who
is
grey
with
a
yellow
stomach
and
the
bigger
graibeestes
now
we
have
dinner
the
minute
we
get
in
and
then
we
must
talk
about
it
the
game
was
skinned
and
cut
up
in
the
courtyard
and
the
intentions
of
the
lord
high
islander
had
certainly
been
carried
out
for
the
blugraiwee
was
and
the
other
animals
just
what
was
needed
and
after
dinner
the
lord
high
islander
took
lucy
and
philip
up
on
to
the
top
of
the
highest
tower
and
the
three
lay
in
the
sun
eating
toffee
and
gazing
out
over
the
sea
at
the
faint
distant
blue
of
the
island
island
where
we
are
allowed
to
go
as
the
lord
high
islander
sadly
pointed
out
said
lucy
gently
wo
mind
telling
us
what
you
afraid
of
do
mind
telling
us
afraid
too
we
afraid
of
all
sorts
of
things
quite
often
for
yourself
said
philip
but
not
unkindly
not
so
jolly
often
afraid
as
you
seem
to
think
go
ahead
my
lord
might
as
well
call
me
billy
said
the
lord
high
islander
my
name
billy
then
what
is
it
you
afraid
of
hate
being
afraid
said
billy
angrily
course
i
know
no
true
boy
is
afraid
of
anything
except
doing
wrong
one
of
the
told
me
that
but
the
are
afraid
too
of
lucy
asked
glancing
at
the
terrace
below
where
already
the
shadows
were
lengthening
be
getting
dark
soon
i
much
rather
know
what
you
afraid
of
while
it
daylight
we
afraid
of
said
billy
abruptly
the
sea
suppose
a
great
wave
came
and
washed
away
the
castle
and
the
huts
and
the
and
all
of
us
it
never
has
it
lucy
asked
but
everything
must
have
a
beginning
i
know
that
true
because
another
of
the
told
it
me
why
do
you
go
and
live
somewhere
inland
we
could
live
away
from
the
sea
we
islanders
you
know
we
could
bear
not
to
be
near
the
sea
and
we
rather
be
afraid
of
it
than
not
have
it
to
be
afraid
of
but
it
upsets
the
government
because
we
ought
to
be
troops
of
gentle
islanders
and
you
be
quite
happy
if
you
afraid
that
why
it
one
of
your
deeds
to
take
away
our
fear
sounds
jolly
difficult
said
philip
shall
have
to
think
he
added
desperately
so
he
lay
and
thought
with
max
and
brenda
asleep
by
his
side
and
the
parrot
preening
its
bright
feathers
on
the
parapet
of
the
tower
while
lucy
and
the
lord
high
islander
played
cat
cradle
with
a
long
thread
of
seaweed
supper
time
said
billy
at
last
you
thought
of
anything
a
single
thing
said
philip
do
swat
over
it
any
more
said
billy
stay
with
us
and
have
a
jolly
time
you
sure
to
think
of
something
or
else
lucy
will
we
act
charades
they
did
the
rest
of
the
islanders
were
an
extremely
jolly
lot
and
all
the
came
out
of
their
huts
to
be
audience
it
was
a
charming
evening
and
ended
up
with
all
over
the
castle
to
wake
next
morning
on
a
bed
of
soft
dry
seaweed
and
to
know
that
the
day
was
to
be
spent
in
having
a
good
time
with
the
jolliest
set
of
children
she
had
ever
met
was
delightful
to
lucy
philip
delight
was
dashed
by
the
knowledge
that
he
must
sooner
or
later
but
the
day
passed
most
agreeably
they
all
bathed
in
the
rock
pools
picked
up
for
dinner
played
rounders
in
the
afternoon
and
in
the
evening
danced
to
the
music
made
by
the
who
most
of
them
carried
flutes
in
their
pockets
and
who
were
all
very
flattered
at
being
asked
to
play
so
the
pleasant
days
went
on
every
morning
philip
said
to
himself
i
really
think
of
something
and
every
night
he
said
really
ought
to
have
thought
of
something
but
he
never
could
think
of
anything
to
take
away
the
fear
of
the
gentle
islanders
it
was
on
the
sixth
night
that
the
storm
came
the
wind
blew
and
the
sea
roared
and
the
castle
shook
to
its
very
foundations
and
philip
awakened
by
the
noise
and
the
shaking
sat
up
in
bed
and
understood
what
the
fear
was
that
spoiled
the
happiness
of
the
dwellers
by
the
sea
the
sea
did
sweep
us
all
away
he
said
they
have
even
got
a
boat
and
then
when
he
was
quite
far
from
expecting
it
he
did
think
of
something
and
he
went
on
thinking
about
it
so
hard
that
he
sleep
any
more
and
in
the
morning
he
said
to
the
parrot
thought
of
something
and
i
not
going
to
tell
the
others
but
i
ca
do
it
all
by
myself
do
you
think
you
could
get
perrin
for
me
will
try
with
pleasure
replied
the
obliging
bird
and
flew
off
without
further
speech
that
afternoon
just
as
a
picnic
tea
was
ending
a
great
shadow
fell
on
the
party
and
next
moment
the
hippogriff
alighted
with
perrin
and
the
parrot
on
its
back
you
said
philip
and
led
perrin
away
and
began
to
talk
to
him
in
whispers
sir
perrin
answered
suddenly
and
aloud
sorry
but
i
could
think
of
it
you
know
philip
asked
know
everything
as
is
to
be
known
in
my
trade
said
perrin
carpentry
one
thing
and
manners
is
another
not
but
what
i
know
manners
too
which
is
why
i
wo
be
a
party
to
no
such
a
thing
you
do
understand
said
philip
trying
to
keep
up
with
perrin
long
strides
i
want
to
do
is
for
you
to
build
a
ark
on
the
top
of
the
highest
tower
then
when
the
sea
rough
and
the
wind
blows
all
the
can
just
get
into
their
ark
and
then
they
be
quite
safe
whatever
happens
said
all
that
afore
said
perrin
i
wonder
at
you
so
i
do
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
said
poor
philip
in
gloom
the
all
right
said
perrin
ai
nothing
to
complain
of
the
what
wrong
philip
asked
impatiently
come
to
the
wrong
shop
said
perrin
slowly
ai
the
man
to
take
away
another
chap
job
not
if
he
was
to
be
in
the
humblest
way
of
business
but
when
it
comes
to
slapping
the
government
in
the
face
well
there
master
pip
i
would
have
thought
it
of
you
as
much
as
my
place
is
worth
here
said
philip
stopping
short
in
despair
you
tell
me
straight
out
why
you
wo
help
me
not
to
go
building
arks
at
my
time
of
life
said
perrin
noah
break
his
old
heart
so
he
would
if
i
was
to
take
on
his
job
over
his
head
you
mean
i
ought
to
ask
him
you
ought
to
ask
him
i
do
mind
lending
a
hand
under
his
directions
acting
as
foreman
like
so
as
to
make
a
good
job
of
it
but
it
him
you
must
give
your
order
to
the
parrot
and
the
hippogriff
between
them
managed
to
get
noah
to
the
castle
by
noon
of
the
next
day
you
have
minded
philip
immediately
asked
him
i
had
an
ark
built
without
asking
you
to
do
it
said
noah
mildly
might
have
been
a
little
hurt
i
have
had
some
experience
you
know
my
lord
do
you
call
me
that
philip
asked
you
are
of
course
your
deed
of
slaying
the
lions
counts
one
to
you
and
by
virtue
of
it
you
are
now
a
baron
i
congratulate
you
lord
leo
said
noah
he
approved
of
philip
idea
and
he
and
perrin
were
soon
busy
making
plans
calculating
strains
and
selecting
materials
then
philip
made
a
speech
to
the
islanders
and
explained
his
idea
there
was
a
great
deal
of
cheering
and
shouting
and
every
one
agreed
that
an
ark
on
the
topmost
tower
would
meet
a
want
and
that
when
once
that
ark
was
there
fear
would
for
ever
be
a
stranger
to
every
gentle
island
heart
and
now
the
great
work
of
building
began
perrin
kindly
consented
to
act
as
foreman
and
set
to
work
a
whole
army
of
workmen
the
of
course
and
soon
the
sound
of
saw
and
hammer
mingled
with
the
plash
of
waves
and
cries
of
and
gangs
of
stalwart
in
their
seaweed
tunics
bent
themselves
to
the
task
of
shaping
great
timbers
and
hoisting
them
to
the
top
of
the
highest
tower
where
other
gangs
under
noah
own
eye
reared
a
scaffolding
to
support
the
ark
while
the
building
went
on
the
children
were
not
allowed
to
help
but
they
loved
looking
on
and
almost
felt
that
if
they
looked
on
earnestly
enough
they
must
in
some
strange
mysterious
way
be
actually
helping
you
know
the
feeling
i
daresay
the
hippogriff
who
was
stabled
in
the
castle
flew
up
to
wherever
he
was
wanted
to
assist
in
the
hauling
noah
only
had
to
whisper
the
magic
word
in
his
ear
and
up
he
flew
but
what
that
magic
word
was
the
children
did
not
know
though
they
asked
often
enough
and
now
at
last
the
ark
was
finished
the
scaffolding
was
removed
and
there
was
the
great
noah
ark
firmly
planted
on
the
topmost
tower
it
was
a
perfect
example
of
the
craft
its
boat
part
was
painted
a
dull
red
its
sides
and
ends
were
blue
with
black
windows
and
its
roof
was
bright
scarlet
painted
in
lines
to
imitate
tiles
no
least
detail
was
neglected
even
to
the
white
bird
painted
on
the
roof
which
you
must
have
noticed
in
your
own
noah
ark
illustration
they
loved
looking
on
a
great
festival
was
held
speeches
were
made
and
every
one
who
had
lent
a
hand
in
the
building
even
the
humblest
was
crowned
with
a
wreath
of
fresh
pink
and
green
seaweed
songs
were
sung
and
the
laureate
of
the
a
young
with
pale
blue
eyes
and
no
chin
recited
an
ode
beginning
now
that
we
have
our
noble
ark
no
more
we
tremble
in
the
dark
when
the
great
seas
and
the
winds
cry
out
for
we
are
safe
without
a
doubt
at
undue
risings
of
the
tide
within
our
ark
we
safely
hide
and
bless
the
names
of
those
who
thus
have
built
a
painted
ark
for
us
there
were
three
hundred
and
seventeen
more
lines
very
much
like
these
and
every
one
said
it
was
wonderful
and
the
laureate
was
a
genius
and
how
did
he
do
it
and
what
brains
eh
and
things
like
that
and
philip
and
lucy
had
crowns
too
the
lord
high
islander
made
a
vote
of
thanks
to
philip
who
modestly
replied
that
it
was
nothing
really
and
anybody
could
have
done
it
and
a
spirit
of
gladness
spread
about
among
the
company
so
that
every
one
was
smiling
and
shaking
hands
with
everybody
else
and
even
the
were
making
little
polite
old
jokes
and
slapping
each
other
on
the
back
and
calling
each
other
chap
which
was
not
at
all
their
habit
in
ordinary
life
the
whole
castle
was
decorated
with
garlands
of
pink
and
green
seaweed
like
the
wreaths
that
people
were
wearing
and
the
whole
scene
was
the
gayest
and
happiest
you
can
imagine
and
then
the
dreadful
thing
happened
philip
and
lucy
were
standing
in
their
seaweed
tunics
for
of
course
they
had
since
the
first
day
worn
the
costume
of
the
country
on
the
platform
in
the
courtyard
noah
had
just
said
then
we
will
enjoy
this
enjoyable
day
to
the
very
end
and
return
to
the
city
when
a
shadow
fell
on
the
group
it
was
the
hippogriff
and
on
its
back
was
some
one
before
any
one
could
see
who
that
some
one
was
the
hippogriff
had
flown
low
enough
for
that
some
one
to
catch
philip
by
his
seaweed
tunic
and
to
swing
him
off
his
feet
and
on
to
the
hippogriff
back
lucy
screamed
perrin
said
i
say
none
of
that
and
noah
said
me
and
they
all
reached
out
their
hands
to
pull
philip
back
but
they
were
all
too
late
wo
go
put
me
down
philip
shouted
they
all
heard
that
and
also
they
heard
the
answer
of
the
person
on
the
hippogriff
the
person
who
had
snatched
philip
on
to
its
back
wo
you
my
lord
we
soon
see
about
that
the
person
said
three
people
there
knew
that
voice
four
counting
philip
six
counting
the
dogs
the
dogs
barked
and
growled
noah
said
it
and
lucy
screamed
no
oh
no
it
that
pretenderette
the
parrot
with
great
presence
of
mind
flew
up
into
the
air
and
attacked
the
ear
of
the
pretenderette
for
as
old
books
say
it
was
indeed
that
unprincipled
character
who
had
broken
from
prison
and
once
more
stolen
the
hippogriff
but
the
pretenderette
was
not
to
be
caught
twice
by
the
same
parrot
she
was
ready
for
the
bird
this
time
and
as
it
touched
her
ear
she
caught
it
in
her
motor
veil
which
she
must
have
loosened
beforehand
and
thrust
it
into
a
wicker
cage
that
hung
ready
from
the
saddle
of
the
hippogriff
who
hovered
on
his
wide
white
wings
above
the
crowd
of
faces
upturned
we
shall
see
her
face
lucy
thought
for
she
could
not
get
rid
of
the
feeling
that
if
she
could
only
see
the
pretenderette
face
she
would
recognise
it
but
the
pretenderette
was
too
wily
to
look
down
unveiled
she
turned
her
face
up
and
she
must
have
whispered
the
magic
word
for
the
hippogriff
rose
in
the
air
and
began
to
fly
away
with
incredible
swiftness
across
the
sea
what
shall
i
do
cried
lucy
wringing
her
hands
you
have
often
heard
of
people
wringing
their
hands
lucy
i
assure
you
really
did
wring
hers
noah
what
will
she
do
with
him
where
will
she
take
him
what
shall
i
do
how
can
i
find
him
again
deeply
regret
my
dear
child
said
noah
i
find
myself
quite
unable
to
answer
any
single
one
of
your
questions
ca
i
go
after
him
lucy
persisted
am
sorry
to
say
said
noah
we
have
no
boats
the
pretenderette
has
stolen
our
one
and
only
hippogriff
and
none
of
our
camels
can
fly
what
can
i
lucy
stamped
her
foot
in
her
agony
of
impatience
my
child
noah
aggravatingly
replied
to
go
to
bed
and
get
a
good
night
rest
we
will
return
to
the
city
and
see
what
can
be
done
we
must
consult
the
oracle
ca
we
go
said
lucy
crying
oracle
is
worth
consulting
till
it
had
its
night
rest
said
noah
is
a
three
days
journey
if
we
started
now
see
it
is
already
dusk
we
should
arrive
in
the
middle
of
the
night
we
will
start
early
in
the
morning
but
early
in
the
morning
there
was
no
starting
from
the
castle
of
the
dwellers
by
the
sea
there
was
indeed
no
one
to
start
and
there
was
no
castle
to
start
from
a
young
blugraiwee
peeping
out
of
its
hole
after
a
rather
disturbed
night
to
see
whether
any
human
beings
were
yet
stirring
or
whether
it
might
venture
out
in
search
of
yellow
periwinkles
which
are
its
favourite
food
started
pricked
its
spotted
ears
looked
again
and
disdaining
the
cover
of
the
rocks
walked
boldly
out
across
the
beach
for
the
beach
was
deserted
there
was
no
one
there
no
noah
no
lucy
no
gentle
islanders
no
and
what
is
more
there
were
no
huts
and
there
was
no
castle
all
was
smooth
plain
bare
beach
for
the
sea
had
at
last
risen
the
fear
of
the
dwellers
had
been
justified
whether
the
sea
had
been
curious
about
the
ark
no
one
knows
no
one
will
ever
know
at
any
rate
the
sea
had
risen
up
and
swept
away
from
the
beach
every
trace
of
the
castle
the
huts
and
the
folk
who
had
lived
there
a
bright
parrot
with
a
streamer
of
motor
veiling
hanging
to
one
claw
called
suddenly
from
the
clear
air
to
the
little
blugraiwee
up
the
parrot
asked
everything
got
to
do
know
i
sure
said
the
little
blugraiwee
human
things
are
always
coming
and
going
have
some
periwinkles
they
very
fine
this
morning
after
the
storm
it
said
chapter
viii
ups
and
downs
we
left
lucy
in
tears
and
philip
in
the
grasp
of
the
hateful
pretenderette
who
seated
on
the
hippogriff
was
bearing
him
away
across
the
smooth
blueness
of
the
wide
sea
noah
said
lucy
between
sniffs
and
sobs
she
you
say
the
hippogriff
could
only
carry
one
ordinary
human
being
said
noah
gently
forget
that
dear
philip
is
now
an
earl
do
you
really
think
he
safe
lucy
asked
said
noah
now
dear
lucy
no
more
questions
since
your
arrival
on
our
shores
i
have
been
gradually
growing
more
accustomed
to
being
questioned
but
i
still
find
it
unpleasant
and
fatiguing
desist
i
entreat
so
lucy
desisted
and
every
one
went
to
bed
and
for
crying
is
very
tiring
to
sleep
but
not
for
long
lucy
was
awakened
in
her
bed
of
soft
dry
seaweed
by
the
sound
of
the
castle
alarm
bell
and
by
the
blaring
of
trumpets
and
the
shouting
of
many
voices
a
bright
light
shone
in
at
the
window
of
her
room
she
jumped
up
and
ran
to
the
window
and
leaned
out
below
lay
the
great
courtyard
of
the
castle
a
moving
sea
of
people
on
which
hundreds
of
torches
seemed
to
float
and
the
sound
of
shouting
rose
in
the
air
as
foam
rises
in
the
wind
fear
the
fear
people
were
shouting
the
ark
to
the
ark
and
the
black
night
that
pressed
round
the
castle
was
loud
with
the
wild
roar
of
waves
and
the
shriek
of
a
tumultuous
wind
lucy
ran
to
the
door
of
her
room
but
suddenly
she
stopped
clothes
she
said
and
dressed
herself
hastily
for
she
perceived
that
her
own
petticoats
and
shoes
were
likely
to
have
better
wearing
qualities
than
seaweed
could
possess
and
if
they
were
all
going
to
take
refuge
in
the
ark
she
felt
she
would
rather
have
her
own
clothes
on
noah
is
sure
to
come
for
me
she
most
sensibly
told
herself
i
get
as
many
clothes
on
as
i
can
her
own
dress
of
course
had
been
left
at
polistopolis
but
the
ballet
dress
would
be
better
than
the
seaweed
tunic
when
she
was
dressed
she
ran
into
philip
room
and
rolled
his
clothes
into
a
little
bundle
and
carried
it
under
her
arm
as
she
ran
down
the
stairs
down
she
met
noah
coming
up
you
ready
he
said
is
well
do
not
be
alarmed
my
lucy
the
tide
is
rising
but
slowly
there
will
be
time
for
every
one
to
escape
all
is
in
train
and
the
embarkation
of
the
animals
is
even
now
in
progress
there
has
been
a
little
delay
in
sorting
the
beasts
into
pairs
but
we
are
getting
on
the
lord
high
islander
is
showing
remarkable
qualities
all
the
big
animals
are
on
board
the
pigs
were
being
coaxed
on
as
i
came
up
and
the
are
having
a
late
supper
do
not
be
alarmed
ca
help
being
alarmed
said
lucy
slipping
her
free
hand
into
noah
i
wo
cry
or
be
silly
oh
i
do
wish
philip
was
here
unreasonable
of
girl

said
noah

danger
and
you
wish
him
to
be
here
to
share
it

danger

we
said
lucy
quickly
thought
you
said
i
was
to
be
alarmed
more
you
are
said
noah
shortly
course
you
in
danger
but
there
me
and
there
the
ark
what
more
do
you
want
lucy
answered
in
a
very
small
voice
and
the
two
made
their
way
to
a
raised
platform
overlooking
the
long
inclined
road
which
led
up
to
the
tower
on
which
the
ark
had
been
built
a
long
procession
toiled
slowly
up
it
of
animals
in
pairs
urged
and
goaded
by
the
under
the
orders
of
the
lord
high
islander
the
wild
wind
blew
the
flames
of
the
torches
out
like
golden
streamers
and
the
sound
of
the
waves
was
like
thunder
on
the
shore
down
below
other
were
busy
carrying
bales
tied
up
in
seaweed
seen
from
above
the
busy
figures
looked
like
ants
when
you
kick
into
an
and
the
little
ant
people
run
this
way
and
that
way
and
every
way
about
their
little
ant
businesses
the
lord
high
islander
came
in
pale
and
serious
with
all
the
calm
competence
of
napoleon
at
a
crisis
to
have
to
worry
you
sir
he
said
to
noah
of
course
your
experience
is
invaluable
just
now
i
ca
remember
what
bears
eat
is
it
hay
or
meat
buns
said
lucy
beg
your
pardon
noah
of
course
i
ought
to
have
waited
for
you
to
say
my
ark
said
noah
were
unknown
and
bears
were
fed
entirely
on
honey
the
providing
of
which
kept
our
pair
of
bees
fully
employed
but
if
you
are
sure
bears
buns
we
must
always
be
humane
dear
lucy
and
study
the
natural
taste
of
the
animals
in
our
charge
love
them
said
lucy
and
honey
said
the
lord
islander
what
about
bats
do
know
what
bats
eat
said
noah
believe
it
was
settled
after
some
discussion
that
they
do
eat
cats
but
what
they
eat
is
one
of
the
eleven
mysteries
you
had
better
let
the
bats
fast
sir
said
the
lord
high
islander
is
all
going
well
shall
i
come
down
and
lend
a
personal
eye
think
i
managing
all
right
sir
said
the
lord
high
islander
modestly
see
it
a
great
honour
for
me
the
are
carrying
in
the
provisions
the
boys
are
stowing
them
and
also
herding
the
beasts
they
are
very
good
workers
sir
you
frightened
lucy
whispered
as
he
turned
to
go
back
to
his
overseeing
illustration
a
long
procession
toiled
slowly
up
it
of
animals
in
pairs
i
said
the
lord
high
islander
you
understand
that
been
promoted
to
be
lord
of
polistarchia
and
of
course
the
hearts
of
all
are
strangers
to
fear
but
just
think
what
a
difficult
thing
fear
would
have
been
to
be
a
stranger
to
if
you
and
philip
had
got
us
the
ark
was
philip
doing
said
lucy
you
think
he
all
right
think
his
heart
is
a
stranger
to
fear
naturally
said
the
lord
high
islander
he
certain
to
be
all
right
when
the
last
of
the
animals
had
sniffed
and
snivelled
its
way
into
the
ark
it
was
a
porcupine
with
a
cold
in
its
head
the
islanders
the
lucy
and
noah
followed
and
when
every
one
was
in
the
door
of
the
ark
was
shut
from
inside
by
an
ingenious
mechanical
contrivance
worked
by
a
more
than
usually
intelligent
you
must
not
suppose
that
the
inside
of
the
ark
was
anything
like
the
inside
of
your
own
noah
ark
where
all
the
animals
are
put
in
anyhow
all
mixed
together
and
wrong
way
up
as
likely
as
not
that
with
live
animals
and
live
people
would
as
you
will
readily
imagine
be
quite
uncomfortable
the
inside
of
the
ark
which
had
been
built
under
the
direction
of
noah
and
perrin
was
not
at
all
like
that
it
was
more
like
the
inside
of
a
big
atlantic
liner
than
anything
else
i
can
think
of
all
the
animals
were
stowed
away
in
suitable
stalls
and
there
were
delightful
cabins
for
all
those
for
whom
cabins
were
suitable
the
islanders
and
the
retired
to
their
cabins
in
perfect
order
and
lucy
and
noah
perrin
and
the
lord
high
islander
gathered
in
the
saloon
which
was
large
and
had
walls
and
doors
of
inlaid
and
pink
coral
it
was
lighted
by
glass
globes
filled
with
phosphorus
collected
by
an
ingenious
process
invented
by
another
of
the
now
said
noah
beg
that
anxiety
may
be
dismissed
from
every
mind
if
the
waters
subside
they
leave
us
safe
if
they
rise
as
i
confidently
expect
them
to
do
our
ark
will
float
and
we
still
are
safe
in
the
morning
i
will
take
soundings
and
begin
to
steer
a
course
we
will
select
a
suitable
spot
on
the
shore
land
and
proceed
to
the
hidden
places
where
we
will
consult
the
oracle
a
little
refreshment
before
we
retire
for
what
is
left
of
the
night
a
captain
biscuit
would
perhaps
not
be
inappropriate
he
took
a
tin
from
a
locker
and
handed
it
round
sir
said
the
lord
high
islander
munching
a
head
you
have
for
the
right
thing
practice
said
noah
modestly
you
said
lucy
taking
a
biscuit
wish
the
sentence
was
never
finished
with
a
sickening
suddenness
the
floor
of
the
saloon
heaved
up
under
their
feet
a
roaring
surging
battering
sound
broke
round
them
the
saloon
tipped
over
on
one
side
and
the
whole
party
was
thrown
on
the
pink
silk
cushions
of
the
long
settee
a
shudder
seemed
to
run
through
the
ark
from
end
to
end
and
is
it
oh
what
is
it
cried
lucy
as
the
ark
heeled
over
the
other
way
and
the
unfortunate
occupants
were
thrown
on
to
the
opposite
set
of
cushions
it
really
now
rather
like
what
you
imagine
the
inside
of
your
noah
ark
must
be
when
you
put
in
noah
and
his
family
and
a
few
hastily
chosen
animals
and
shake
them
all
up
together
the
sea
cried
the
lord
high
islander
the
great
fear
come
upon
us
and
i
not
afraid
he
drew
himself
up
as
well
as
he
could
in
his
cramped
position
with
noah
elbow
pinning
his
shoulder
down
and
perrin
boot
on
his
ear
with
a
shake
and
a
shiver
the
ark
righted
itself
and
the
floor
of
the
saloon
got
flat
again
all
right
said
perrin
resuming
control
of
his
boot
workmanship
it
do
tell
she
ai
shipped
a
drop
noah
sir
all
right
said
noah
taking
his
elbow
to
himself
and
standing
up
rather
shakily
on
his
yellow
mat
afloat
we
afloat
on
the
dark
rolling
tide
the
ark
and
the
crew
are
inside
up
with
the
flag
let
it
wave
the
sea
we
afloat
we
afloat
and
what
else
should
we
be
do
know
said
lucy
there
is
any
flag
is
there
principle
the
same
said
noah
i
afraid
we
think
of
a
flag
did
said
perrin
only
a
jubilee
hankey
he
drew
it
slowly
from
his
a
cotton
union
jack
it
was
it
shall
wave
all
right
but
not
till
daylight
i
think
sir
discretion
the
better
part
of
do
you
think
noah
sir
would
do
to
open
the
ark
out
of
hours
so
to
speak
so
said
noah
two
three
bed
the
ark
swayed
easily
on
a
sea
not
too
rough
the
saloon
passengers
staggered
to
their
cabins
and
silence
reigned
in
the
ark
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
the
pretenderette
dropped
the
wicker
cage
containing
the
parrot
into
the
sea
an
unpardonable
piece
of
cruelty
and
revenge
unpardonable
that
is
unless
you
consider
that
she
did
not
really
know
any
better
the
hippogriff
white
wings
swept
on
philip
now
laid
across
the
knees
of
the
pretenderette
a
most
undignified
attitude
for
any
boy
and
i
hope
none
of
you
may
be
placed
in
such
a
position
screamed
as
the
cage
struck
the
water
and
polly
he
cried
right
the
parrot
answered
your
pecker
up
did
it
say
the
pretenderette
asked
about
peck
said
philip
upside
down
said
the
pretenderette
with
satisfaction
wo
do
any
more
pecking
for
some
time
to
come
and
the
wide
hippogriff
wings
swept
on
over
the
wide
sea
polly
cage
fell
and
floated
and
it
floated
alone
till
the
dawn
when
with
wheelings
and
waftings
and
cries
the
gulls
came
from
far
and
near
to
see
what
this
new
strange
thing
might
be
that
bobbed
up
and
down
in
their
waters
in
the
light
of
the
day
said
polly
in
clinging
upside
down
to
the
top
bars
of
the
cage
yourself
replied
the
eldest
gull
up
and
who
are
you
and
what
are
you
doing
in
that
unnatural
lobster
pot
conjure
you
said
the
parrot
earnestly
conjure
you
by
our
common
birdhood
to
help
me
in
my
misfortune
gull
who
a
gull
can
resist
that
appeal
said
the
master
of
the
sea
birds
can
we
do
matter
is
urgent
said
polly
but
quite
calmly
am
getting
very
wet
and
i
dislike
salt
water
it
is
bad
for
my
plumage
may
i
give
an
order
to
your
followers
said
the
master
gull
with
a
graceful
wheel
and
whirl
of
his
splendid
wings
four
of
my
brothers
raise
this
detested
trap
high
above
the
waves
said
the
parrot
let
others
of
you
with
your
brave
strong
beaks
break
through
the
bars
and
set
me
free
said
the
master
gull
little
thing
you
know
and
his
own
beak
was
the
first
to
take
hold
of
the
cage
which
presently
the
gulls
lifted
in
the
air
and
broke
through
setting
the
parrot
free
you
the
parrot
said
shaking
wet
wings
and
spreading
them
good
turn
deserves
another
the
beach
yonder
was
white
with
cockles
but
yesterday
you
they
all
said
and
flew
fleetly
cocklewards
and
that
was
how
the
parrot
got
free
from
the
cage
and
went
back
to
the
shore
to
have
that
little
talk
with
the
blugraiwee
which
i
told
you
about
in
the
last
chapter
the
ark
was
really
very
pleasant
by
daylight
with
the
sun
shining
in
at
its
windows
the
sun
shone
outside
as
well
of
course
and
the
union
jack
waved
cheerfully
in
the
wind
breakfast
was
served
on
the
terrace
at
the
end
of
the
ark
you
know
that
terrace
where
the
boat
part
turns
up
it
was
a
very
nice
breakfast
and
the
sea
was
quite
smooth
a
quite
perfect
sea
this
was
rather
fortunate
for
there
was
nothing
else
sea
on
every
side
of
the
ark
no
land
at
all
shall
we
find
the
way
lucy
asked
the
lord
high
islander
nothing
but
sea
he
answered
all
the
better
really
noah
steers
much
better
when
there
no
land
in
sight
it
all
practice
you
know
when
we
come
in
sight
of
land
will
he
steer
badly
then
anybody
can
steer
then
said
billy
if
you
like
so
it
was
lucy
who
steered
the
ark
into
harbour
under
noah
directions
arks
are
very
easy
to
steer
if
you
only
know
the
way
of
course
arks
are
not
like
other
vessels
they
require
neither
sails
nor
steam
engines
nor
oars
to
make
them
move
the
very
arkishness
of
the
ark
makes
it
move
just
as
the
steersman
wishes
he
only
has
to
say
ahead
and
so
on
and
the
ark
unlike
many
people
i
know
immediately
does
as
it
is
told
so
steering
was
easy
and
pleasant
one
just
had
to
keep
the
ark
nose
towards
the
distant
domes
and
pinnacles
of
a
town
that
shone
and
glittered
on
the
shore
a
few
miles
away
and
the
town
grew
nearer
and
nearer
and
the
black
streak
that
was
the
people
of
the
town
began
to
show
white
dots
that
were
the
faces
and
then
the
ark
was
moored
against
a
quay
side
and
a
friendly
populace
cheered
as
noah
stepped
on
to
firm
land
to
be
welcomed
by
the
governor
of
the
town
and
a
choice
selection
of
eminent
citizens
quite
an
event
for
them
said
perrin
do
have
much
happening
here
a
very
lazy
lot
they
be
almost
as
bad
as
somnolentia
makes
them
lazy
lucy
asked
owing
to
the
onions
and
potatoes
growing
wild
in
these
parts
i
believe
said
the
lord
high
islander
get
enough
to
eat
without
working
and
the
onions
make
them
sleepy
they
talked
apart
while
noah
was
arranging
things
with
the
governor
of
the
town
who
had
come
down
to
the
harbour
in
a
hurry
and
a
flurry
and
a
furry
gown
arranged
everything
said
noah
at
last
islanders
and
the
and
the
animals
are
to
be
allowed
to
camp
in
the
public
park
till
we
consulted
the
oracle
and
decided
what
to
be
done
with
them
they
must
live
somewhere
i
suppose
life
has
become
much
too
eventful
for
me
lately
however
there
are
only
three
more
deeds
for
the
earl
of
ark
to
do
and
then
perhaps
we
shall
have
a
little
peace
and
quietness
earl
of
ark
lucy
repeated
you
know
i
do
wish
you
try
to
remember
that
he
an
earl
now
now
you
and
i
must
take
camel
and
be
off
and
now
came
seven
long
days
of
camel
travelling
through
desert
and
forest
and
over
hill
and
through
valley
till
at
last
lucy
and
noah
came
to
the
hidden
place
where
the
oracle
is
and
where
that
is
i
may
not
tell
you
because
it
one
of
the
eleven
mysteries
and
i
must
not
tell
you
what
the
oracle
is
because
that
is
another
of
the
mysteries
but
i
may
tell
you
that
if
you
want
to
consult
the
oracle
you
have
to
go
a
long
way
between
rows
of
round
pillars
rather
like
those
in
egyptian
tombs
and
as
you
go
it
gets
darker
and
darker
and
when
it
is
quite
dark
you
see
a
little
little
light
a
very
long
way
off
and
you
hear
very
far
away
a
beautiful
music
and
you
smell
the
scent
of
flowers
that
do
not
grow
in
any
wood
or
field
or
garden
of
this
earth
mixed
with
this
scent
is
the
scent
of
incense
and
of
old
tapestried
rooms
where
no
one
has
lived
for
a
very
long
time
and
you
remember
all
the
sad
and
beautiful
things
you
have
ever
seen
or
heard
and
you
fall
down
on
the
ground
and
hide
your
face
in
your
hands
and
call
on
the
oracle
and
if
you
are
the
right
sort
of
person
the
oracle
answers
you
lucy
and
noah
waited
in
the
dark
for
the
voice
of
the
oracle
and
at
last
it
spoke
lucy
heard
no
words
only
the
most
beautiful
voice
in
the
world
speaking
softly
and
so
sweetly
and
finely
and
bravely
that
at
once
she
felt
herself
brave
enough
to
dare
any
danger
and
strong
enough
to
do
any
deed
that
might
be
needed
to
get
philip
out
of
the
clutches
of
the
base
pretenderette
all
the
tiredness
of
her
long
journey
faded
away
and
but
for
the
thought
that
philip
needed
her
she
would
have
been
content
to
listen
for
ever
to
that
golden
voice
everything
else
in
the
world
faded
away
and
grew
to
seem
worthless
and
unmeaning
only
the
soft
golden
voice
remained
and
the
grey
hard
voice
that
said
got
to
look
after
philip
you
know
and
the
two
voices
together
made
a
harmony
more
beautiful
than
you
will
find
in
any
of
beethoven
sonatas
because
lucy
knew
that
she
should
follow
the
grey
voice
and
remember
the
golden
voice
as
long
as
she
lived
but
something
was
tiresomely
pulling
at
her
sleeve
dragging
her
away
from
the
wonderful
golden
voice
noah
was
pulling
her
sleeve
and
saying
away
and
they
turned
their
backs
on
the
little
light
and
the
music
and
the
enchanting
perfumes
and
instantly
the
voice
stopped
and
they
were
walking
between
dusky
pillars
towards
a
far
grey
speck
of
sunlight
it
was
not
till
they
were
once
more
under
the
bare
sky
that
lucy
said
did
it
say
must
have
heard
said
noah
only
heard
the
voice
and
what
it
meant
i
did
understand
the
words
but
the
voice
was
like
dreams
and
everything
beautiful
i
ever
thought
of
thought
it
a
wonderfully
oracle
said
noah
briskly
the
voice
was
quite
distinct
and
i
remember
every
word
it
said
which
just
shows
how
differently
the
same
thing
may
strike
two
people
did
it
say
lucy
asked
trotting
along
beside
him
still
clutching
philip
bundle
which
through
all
these
days
she
had
never
let
go
and
noah
gravely
recited
the
following
lines
i
agree
with
him
that
for
an
oracle
they
were
extremely
straightforward
had
better
embark
once
again
in
the
ark
and
sailing
from
dryland
make
straight
for
the
island
it
say
that
lucy
asked
course
it
did
said
noah
a
special
instruction
to
me
but
i
daresay
you
heard
something
quite
different
the
oracle
say
the
same
thing
to
every
one
of
course
did
you
get
any
special
instruction
to
try
to
be
brave
and
good
said
lucy
shyly
then
said
noah
carry
out
your
instructions
and
carry
out
mine
what
the
use
of
going
to
the
island
if
you
ca
land
when
you
get
there
lucy
insisted
know
only
two
people
can
land
there
and
we
not
them
are
we
if
you
begin
asking
what
the
use
we
sha
get
anywhere
said
noah
more
than
half
the
things
you
say
are
questions
i
sorry
this
chapter
is
cut
up
into
bits
with
lines
of
stars
but
stars
are
difficult
to
avoid
when
you
have
to
tell
about
a
lot
of
different
things
happening
all
at
once
that
is
why
it
is
much
better
always
to
keep
your
party
together
if
you
can
and
i
have
allowed
mine
to
get
separated
so
that
philip
the
parrot
and
the
rest
of
the
company
are
going
through
three
sets
of
adventures
all
at
the
same
time
this
is
most
trying
for
me
and
fully
accounts
for
the
stars
which
i
hope
you
excuse
however
we
now
come
back
by
way
of
the
stars
to
philip
wrong
way
up
in
the
clutches
of
the
pretenderette
she
had
breathed
the
magic
word
in
the
hippogriff
ear
but
she
had
not
added
any
special
order
so
the
hippogriff
was
entirely
its
own
master
as
far
as
the
choice
of
where
it
was
to
go
was
concerned
it
tossed
its
white
mane
after
circling
three
times
between
air
and
sky
made
straight
for
the
the
pretenderette
did
know
that
it
was
the
and
as
they
got
nearer
and
she
could
see
plainly
its
sands
its
palms
and
its
waterfalls
its
cool
green
thickets
and
many
tinted
flowers
and
glowing
fruits
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
might
do
worse
than
land
there
and
rest
for
a
little
while
for
even
the
most
disagreeable
people
get
tired
sometimes
and
the
pretenderette
had
had
a
hard
day
of
it
so
she
made
no
attempt
to
check
the
hippogriff
or
alter
its
course
and
when
the
hippogriff
was
hovering
but
a
few
inches
from
the
grass
of
the
most
beautiful
of
the
island
glades
she
jerked
philip
roughly
off
her
knee
and
he
fell
all
in
a
heap
on
the
ground
with
great
presence
of
mind
our
hero
if
he
is
a
hero
by
now
he
never
will
be
picked
himself
up
and
bolted
into
the
bushes
no
rabbit
could
have
bolted
more
instantly
and
fleetly
teach
you
said
the
furious
pretenderette
preparing
to
alight
she
looked
down
to
find
a
soft
place
to
jump
on
and
then
she
saw
that
every
blade
of
grass
was
a
tiny
spear
of
steel
and
every
spear
was
pointed
at
her
she
made
the
hippogriff
take
her
to
another
glade
more
little
steel
spears
to
the
rainbow
sands
but
on
looking
at
them
she
saw
that
they
were
quivering
quicksands
wherever
green
grass
had
grown
the
spears
now
grew
and
wherever
the
sand
was
it
was
a
terrible
trap
of
quicksand
she
tried
to
dismount
in
a
little
pool
but
fortunately
for
her
she
noticed
in
time
that
what
shone
in
it
so
silvery
was
not
water
but
molten
metal
a
nasty
place
said
the
pretenderette
do
know
that
i
could
have
chosen
a
nastier
place
to
leave
that
naughty
child
in
he
know
who
master
by
the
time
i
send
to
fetch
him
back
to
prison
here
you
get
back
to
polistopolis
as
fast
as
you
can
see
please
i
mean
she
added
and
then
she
spoke
the
magic
word
philip
was
peeping
through
the
bushes
close
by
and
he
heard
that
magic
word
i
dare
not
tell
you
what
it
is
and
he
saw
for
the
first
time
the
face
of
the
pretenderette
and
he
trembled
and
shivered
in
his
bushy
for
the
pretenderette
was
the
only
really
unpleasant
person
philip
had
ever
met
in
the
world
it
was
lucy
nurse
the
nurse
with
the
grey
dress
and
the
big
fat
feet
who
had
been
so
cross
to
him
and
had
pulled
down
his
city
on
earth
philip
wondered
to
himself
she
get
and
how
on
earth
shall
i
get
away
from
her
he
had
not
seen
the
spears
and
the
quicksands
and
the
molten
metal
and
he
was
waiting
unhappily
for
her
to
alight
and
for
a
game
of
hide
and
seek
to
begin
which
he
was
not
at
all
anxious
to
play
even
as
he
wondered
the
hippogriff
spread
wings
and
flew
away
and
philip
was
left
alone
on
the
island
but
what
did
that
matter
it
was
much
better
to
be
alone
than
with
that
pretenderette
and
for
philip
there
were
no
metal
and
spears
and
snares
of
quicksand
only
dewy
grass
and
sweet
flowers
and
trees
and
safety
and
delight
only
lucy
were
here
he
said
when
he
was
quite
sure
that
the
pretenderette
was
really
gone
he
came
out
and
explored
the
island
it
had
on
it
every
kind
of
flower
and
fruit
that
you
can
think
of
all
growing
together
there
were
gold
oranges
and
white
orange
flowers
pink
and
red
apples
cherries
and
strawberry
flowers
and
strawberries
all
growing
together
wild
and
sweet
at
the
back
of
his
mind
philip
remembered
that
he
had
at
some
time
or
other
heard
of
an
island
where
fruit
and
blossoms
grew
together
at
the
same
time
but
that
was
all
he
could
remember
he
passed
through
the
lovely
orchards
and
came
to
a
lake
it
was
frozen
and
he
remembered
that
in
the
island
he
had
heard
of
there
was
a
lake
ready
for
skating
even
when
the
flowers
and
fruit
were
on
the
trees
then
he
came
to
a
little
built
all
of
porcupine
quills
like
helen
and
then
he
knew
all
these
wonders
were
on
the
island
that
he
and
helen
had
invented
long
ago
the
island
that
she
used
to
draw
maps
of
our
very
own
island
he
said
and
a
glorious
feeling
of
being
at
home
glowed
through
him
warm
and
delightful
said
no
one
else
might
come
here
that
why
the
pretenderette
could
land
and
why
they
call
it
the
i
find
the
bun
tree
and
have
something
to
eat
and
then
i
go
to
the
and
get
out
the
and
go
back
for
lucy
i
do
wish
i
could
bring
her
here
but
of
course
i
ca
without
asking
helen
the
was
the
magic
yacht
helen
had
invented
for
the
island
he
soon
found
a
bush
whose
fruit
was
buns
and
a
tree
grew
near
it
you
have
no
idea
how
nice
jam
tarts
can
taste
till
you
have
gathered
them
yourself
fresh
and
sticky
from
the
tree
they
are
as
sticky
as
buds
and
much
nicer
to
eat
as
he
went
towards
the
he
grew
happier
and
happier
recognising
one
after
the
other
all
the
places
he
and
helen
had
planned
and
marked
on
the
map
he
passed
by
the
marble
and
gold
house
with
painted
on
the
door
he
longed
to
explore
it
but
the
thought
of
lucy
drove
him
on
as
he
went
down
a
narrow
leafy
woodland
path
towards
the
he
passed
the
door
of
the
dear
little
thatched
cottage
labelled
which
was
the
house
helen
had
insisted
that
she
liked
best
for
her
very
own
pretty
it
is
i
wish
helen
was
here
he
said
helped
to
make
it
i
should
never
have
thought
of
it
without
her
she
ought
to
be
here
he
said
with
that
he
felt
very
lonely
all
of
a
sudden
and
very
sad
and
as
he
went
on
wondering
whether
in
all
this
magic
world
there
might
not
somehow
be
some
magic
strong
enough
to
bring
helen
there
to
see
the
island
that
was
their
very
own
and
to
give
her
consent
to
his
bringing
lucy
to
it
he
turned
a
corner
in
the
woodland
path
and
walked
straight
into
the
arms
of
helen
illustration
walked
straight
into
the
arms
of
helen
chapter
ix
on
the
how
did
you
get
here
said
philip
in
helen
arms
on
the
island
just
walked
out
at
the
other
side
of
a
dream
she
said
could
i
not
come
when
the
door
was
open
and
you
wanted
me
so
and
philip
just
said
helen
he
could
not
find
any
other
words
but
helen
understood
she
always
did
she
said
we
go
to
your
palace
or
mine
i
want
my
supper
and
we
have
our
own
little
yes
i
know
had
your
supper
but
it
be
fun
getting
mine
and
perhaps
you
be
hungry
again
before
we
got
it
they
went
to
the
thatched
cottage
that
was
helen
palace
because
philip
had
had
almost
as
much
of
large
buildings
as
he
wanted
for
a
little
while
the
cottage
had
a
wide
chimney
and
an
open
hearth
and
they
sat
on
the
hearth
and
made
toast
and
philip
almost
forgot
that
he
had
ever
had
any
adventures
and
that
the
toast
was
being
made
on
a
hearth
whose
blue
curled
up
among
the
enchanting
of
a
magic
island
and
before
they
went
to
bed
he
had
told
her
all
about
everything
i
am
so
glad
you
came
he
said
over
and
over
again
is
so
easy
to
tell
you
with
all
the
magic
going
on
i
do
think
i
ever
have
told
you
at
the
grange
with
the
servants
all
about
and
the
i
mean
graham
and
all
the
things
as
not
magic
as
they
could
possibly
be
oh
helen
where
graham
wo
he
hate
your
coming
away
from
him
gone
through
a
dream
door
too
she
said
see
lucy
only
he
does
know
he
really
gone
he
think
it
a
dream
and
he
tell
me
about
it
when
we
both
wake
up
did
you
go
to
sleep
said
philip
brussels
that
telegram
has
come
yet
do
understand
about
time
said
philip
firmly
i
never
shall
i
say
helen
i
was
just
looking
for
the
to
go
off
in
her
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
and
find
lucy
do
think
you
need
she
said
met
a
parrot
on
the
island
just
before
i
met
you
and
it
was
saying
poetry
to
itself
would
be
said
philip
it
was
alive
i
glad
it
alive
though
what
was
it
saying
was
something
like
this
she
said
putting
a
log
of
wood
on
the
fire
and
helen
have
the
island
to
dwell
in
hooray
they
said
of
the
island
it
your
land
and
my
land
hooray
hooray
hooray
till
the
ark
comes
out
of
the
dark
there
those
two
may
stay
for
a
happy
while
and
enjoy
their
island
until
the
giving
day
hooray
then
they
will
hear
the
giving
voice
they
will
hear
and
obey
and
when
people
come
who
need
a
home
they
give
the
island
away
hooray
island
with
flower
and
fruit
and
bower
forest
and
river
and
bay
their
very
own
island
they
sigh
and
smile
and
they
give
their
island
away
nonsense
said
philip
never
will
right
my
pipkin
said
helen
cheerfully
only
told
you
just
to
show
that
you
expected
to
stay
here
philip
and
helen
have
the
island
to
dwell
in
and
now
what
about
bed
they
spent
a
whole
week
on
the
island
it
was
exactly
all
that
they
could
wish
an
island
to
be
because
of
course
they
had
made
it
themselves
and
of
course
they
knew
exactly
what
they
wanted
i
describe
that
week
i
only
know
that
philip
will
never
forget
it
just
think
of
all
the
things
you
could
do
on
a
magic
island
if
you
were
there
with
your
dearest
dear
and
you
know
how
philip
spent
his
time
he
enjoyed
every
minute
of
every
hour
of
every
day
and
best
thing
of
all
that
week
made
him
understand
as
nothing
else
could
have
done
that
helen
still
belonged
to
him
and
that
her
marriage
to
graham
had
not
made
her
any
the
less
philip
very
own
helen
and
then
came
a
day
when
philip
swinging
in
a
magnolia
tree
looked
out
to
sea
and
cried
out
sail
a
sail
oh
helen
here
the
ark
now
it
all
over
let
have
lucy
to
stay
with
us
and
send
the
other
people
away
he
added
sliding
down
the
with
his
face
very
serious
we
ca
dear
helen
reminded
him
island
ours
you
know
and
as
long
as
it
ours
no
one
else
can
land
on
it
we
made
it
like
that
you
know
they
ca
land
said
helen
we
change
the
rule
and
let
them
land
said
helen
it
a
pity
philip
said
the
island
is
the
place
for
islanders
is
it
said
helen
there
no
fear
of
the
sea
here
you
remember
we
made
it
like
that
when
we
made
the
island
said
philip
helen
i
want
to
do
said
helen
but
i
want
to
too
do
said
she
do
you
see
when
you
want
to
and
do
want
to
at
the
same
time
what
you
to
do
there
are
so
many
things
to
think
of
it
like
that
there
one
thing
you
must
think
of
she
said
philip
asked
she
said
softly
there
was
a
silence
and
then
philip
suddenly
hugged
his
sister
and
she
hugged
him
give
it
to
them
he
said
no
use
i
know
i
ought
to
i
shall
only
be
uncomfortable
if
i
do
helen
laughed
boy
of
boys
she
said
and
then
she
looked
sad
of
my
heart
she
said
know
it
not
only
giving
up
our
island
if
we
give
it
away
i
must
go
it
the
only
place
that
there
a
door
into
out
of
my
dreams
ca
let
you
go
he
said
you
got
your
deeds
to
do
she
said
i
ca
help
you
in
those
lucy
can
help
you
but
i
ca
you
like
lucy
now
do
you
i
do
mind
her
said
philip
it
i
want
helen
think
about
that
she
urged
what
the
islanders
want
think
what
it
be
to
them
to
have
the
island
to
live
here
always
safe
from
the
fear
are
three
more
deeds
said
philip
dismally
do
think
i
shall
ever
want
any
more
adventures
as
long
as
i
live
always
want
them
she
said
laughing
at
him
gently
and
now
let
do
the
thing
handsomely
and
give
them
a
splendid
welcome
give
me
a
kiss
and
then
we
gather
heaps
of
roses
so
they
kissed
each
other
but
philip
was
very
unhappy
indeed
though
he
felt
that
he
was
being
rather
noble
and
that
helen
thought
so
too
which
was
naturally
a
great
comfort
there
had
been
a
good
deal
more
of
this
talk
than
i
have
set
down
philip
and
helen
had
hardly
had
time
to
hang
garlands
of
pink
roses
along
the
quayside
where
the
that
perfect
yacht
lay
at
anchor
before
the
blunt
prow
of
the
ark
bumped
heavily
against
the
quayside
and
the
two
dropping
the
rest
of
the
roses
waved
and
smiled
to
the
group
on
the
ark
terrace
the
first
person
to
speak
was
perrin
who
shouted
we
are
again
like
a
clown
then
lucy
said
know
we
ca
land
but
the
oracle
said
come
and
we
came
she
leaned
over
the
bulwark
to
whisper
that
perfect
duck
you
got
with
you
philip
answered
aloud
is
my
sister
helen
helen
this
is
lucy
the
two
looked
at
each
other
and
then
helen
held
out
her
hands
and
she
and
lucy
kissed
each
other
knew
i
should
like
you
lucy
whispered
i
did
know
i
should
like
you
quite
so
much
noah
and
perrin
were
both
bowing
to
helen
a
little
stiffly
but
very
cordially
all
the
same
and
quite
surprisingly
without
surprise
and
the
lord
high
islander
was
looking
at
her
with
his
own
friendly
jolly
schoolboy
grin
you
will
embark
said
noah
politely
can
return
to
the
mainland
and
i
will
explain
to
you
your
remaining
deeds
them
pip
said
helen
do
want
to
embark
at
present
said
philip
shyly
want
you
to
land
one
may
land
on
the
island
save
two
said
noah
am
glad
you
are
the
two
i
feared
one
of
the
two
might
be
the
pretenderette
much
said
philip
helen
and
mine
we
made
it
and
we
want
to
give
it
to
the
islanders
to
keep
for
their
very
own
he
added
feeling
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
any
one
to
believe
that
such
a
glorious
present
was
really
being
made
just
like
that
without
speeches
as
if
it
had
been
a
little
present
of
a
pencil
sharpener
or
a
he
was
right
keep
said
the
lord
high
islander
our
very
own
always
said
philip
there
no
fear
here
you
be
happy
troops
now
for
a
moment
nobody
said
anything
though
all
the
faces
were
expressive
then
the
lord
high
islander
spoke
he
said
all
the
brickish
bricks
and
could
say
no
more
are
lots
of
houses
said
philip
room
for
all
the
animals
and
the
island
is
thirty
miles
round
so
there
lots
of
room
for
the
animals
and
everything
he
felt
happier
than
he
had
ever
done
in
his
life
giving
presents
is
always
enjoyable
and
this
was
such
a
big
and
beautiful
present
and
he
loved
it
so
always
did
say
master
pip
was
a
gentleman
and
i
always
shall
perrin
remarked
congratulate
you
said
noah
i
am
happy
to
announce
that
your
fifth
deed
is
now
accomplished
you
remember
our
empty
silver
your
fifth
deed
was
to
be
the
supplying
of
polistarchia
with
fruit
this
island
is
the
only
place
in
the
kingdom
where
fruit
grows
the
ark
will
serve
to
convey
the
fruit
to
the
mainland
and
the
performance
of
this
deed
raises
you
to
the
rank
of
duke
you
a
dear
said
lucy
in
a
whisper
up
said
philip
fiercely
cheers
said
a
familiar
voice
the
duke
of
donors
cheers
repeated
the
lord
high
islander
the
duke
of
donors
what
a
cheer
all
the
islanders
cheered
and
the
and
lucy
and
perrin
and
noah
and
from
the
inside
of
the
ark
came
enthusiastic
barkings
and
gruntings
and
roarings
and
squeakings
as
the
animals
of
course
joined
in
as
well
as
they
could
thousands
of
gulls
circling
on
white
wings
in
the
sun
above
added
their
screams
to
the
general
chorus
and
when
the
sound
of
the
last
cheer
died
away
a
little
near
familiar
voice
said
done
philip
i
proud
of
you
it
was
the
parrot
who
perched
on
the
rigging
of
the
had
started
the
cheering
that
all
right
it
said
fluttered
on
to
philip
shoulder
and
added
heard
you
calling
for
me
on
the
island
all
the
week
but
i
felt
i
needed
a
rest
i
been
talking
too
much
and
that
pretenderette
and
that
cage
i
assure
you
i
needed
a
little
time
to
get
over
my
adventures
have
all
had
our
adventures
said
noah
gently
and
helen
said
you
land
and
take
possession
of
the
island
i
sure
we
are
longing
to
hear
each
other
adventures
first
said
noah
to
the
lord
high
islander
who
stepped
ashore
very
gravely
when
helen
saw
him
come
forward
she
suddenly
kissed
philip
and
as
the
lord
high
islander
foot
touched
the
shore
of
that
enchanted
island
she
simply
and
suddenly
vanished
cried
philip
wish
i
had
and
his
mouth
trembled
as
mouths
do
if
they
are
going
to
cry
more
a
present
costs
you
the
more
it
worth
said
noah
has
cost
you
so
much
it
the
most
splendid
present
in
the
world
know
said
philip
yourselves
at
home
wo
you
he
just
managed
to
say
and
then
he
found
he
could
not
say
any
more
he
just
turned
and
went
into
the
forest
and
when
he
was
alone
in
a
green
glade
he
flung
himself
down
on
his
face
and
lay
a
long
time
without
moving
it
had
been
such
a
happy
week
and
he
was
so
tired
of
adventures
when
at
last
he
sniffed
with
an
air
of
finality
and
raised
his
head
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
lucy
sitting
quite
still
with
her
back
to
him
he
said
rather
crossly
are
you
doing
here
the
multiplication
table
said
lucy
promptly
and
turned
her
head
as
not
even
to
think
about
you
and
i
have
even
once
turned
round
i
knew
you
wanted
to
be
alone
but
i
wanted
to
be
here
when
you
done
being
alone
see
i
got
something
to
say
to
you
ahead
said
philip
still
grumpy
think
you
perfectly
splendid
said
lucy
very
seriously
i
want
it
to
be
real
pax
for
ever
and
i
help
you
in
the
rest
of
the
adventures
and
if
you
cross
i
try
not
to
mind
napoleon
was
cross
sometimes
i
believe
she
added
pensively
julius
caesar
that
all
right
said
philip
very
awkwardly
we
going
to
be
real
chums
yes
if
you
like
only
i
do
mind
just
this
once
and
it
was
decent
of
you
to
come
and
sit
there
with
your
back
to
me
only
i
hate
gas
said
lucy
obediently
know
only
sometimes
you
feel
you
must
gas
a
little
or
burst
of
admiration
and
i
got
your
proper
clothes
in
a
bundle
i
been
carrying
them
about
ever
since
the
islanders
castle
was
washed
away
here
they
are
she
produced
the
bundle
and
this
time
philip
was
really
touched
i
call
that
something
like
he
said
seaweed
dress
is
all
right
here
but
you
never
know
what
you
may
have
to
go
through
when
you
doing
adventures
there
might
be
thorns
or
snakes
or
anything
i
jolly
glad
to
get
my
boots
back
too
i
say
come
on
let
go
to
helen
palace
and
get
a
banquet
ready
i
know
there
have
to
be
a
banquet
there
always
is
here
i
know
a
quite
near
here
plants
looked
beautiful
as
i
came
along
said
lucy
a
lovely
island
it
is
and
you
made
it
gas
said
philip
warningly
and
i
made
it
the
dearest
darling
said
lucy
well
said
philip
with
resignation
you
must
gas
gas
about
her
the
banquet
was
all
that
you
can
imagine
of
interesting
and
magnificent
and
philip
was
of
course
the
hero
of
the
hour
and
when
the
banquet
was
finished
and
the
last
guest
had
departed
to
its
own
house
for
the
houses
on
the
island
were
of
course
all
ready
to
be
occupied
furnished
to
the
last
point
of
comfort
with
full
of
pins
in
every
room
noah
and
lucy
and
philip
sat
down
on
the
terrace
steps
among
the
pink
roses
for
a
last
little
talk
said
philip
shall
start
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
so
please
will
you
tell
me
now
what
the
next
deed
is
that
i
have
to
do
you
go
by
ark
noah
asked
rolling
up
his
yellow
mat
to
make
an
elbow
rest
and
leaning
on
it
shall
be
delighted
thought
said
philip
might
go
in
the
never
sailed
her
yet
you
know
do
you
think
i
course
you
can
said
noah
if
not
lucy
can
show
you
your
charming
yacht
is
steered
on
precisely
the
same
principle
as
the
ark
and
in
this
land
all
the
winds
are
favourable
you
will
find
the
yacht
suitably
provisioned
and
i
may
add
that
you
can
go
most
of
the
way
to
your
next
deed
by
water
first
the
sea
and
then
the
river
what
asked
philip
the
next
deed
the
extreme
north
of
polistarchia
said
noah
instructively
a
town
called
somnolentia
it
used
to
be
called
briskford
in
happier
days
a
river
then
ran
through
the
town
a
rapid
river
that
brought
much
gold
from
the
mountains
the
people
used
to
work
very
hard
to
keep
the
channel
clear
of
the
lumps
of
gold
which
continually
threatened
to
choke
it
their
fields
were
then
and
fruitful
and
the
inhabitants
were
cheerful
and
happy
but
when
the
hippogriff
was
let
out
of
the
book
a
great
sloth
got
out
too
evading
all
efforts
to
secure
him
the
great
sloth
journeyed
northward
he
is
a
very
large
and
striking
animal
and
by
some
means
either
fear
or
admiration
he
obtained
a
complete
ascendancy
over
the
inhabitants
of
briskford
he
induced
them
to
build
him
a
temple
of
solid
gold
and
while
they
were
doing
this
the
river
bed
became
choked
up
and
the
stream
was
diverted
into
another
channel
far
from
the
town
since
then
the
place
is
fallen
into
decay
the
fields
are
parched
and
untilled
such
water
as
the
people
need
for
drinking
is
drawn
by
great
labour
from
a
well
washing
has
become
shockingly
infrequent
we
to
teach
the
dirty
chaps
to
wash
asked
philip
in
disgust
not
interrupt
said
noah
destroy
the
thread
of
my
narrative
where
was
i
infrequent
said
lucy
if
the
fields
are
dried
up
what
do
they
live
on
replied
noah
grow
freely
and
do
not
need
much
water
gathering
these
is
the
sole
industry
of
this
degraded
people
are
not
considered
a
fruit
but
a
vegetable
he
added
hastily
seeing
another
question
trembling
on
philip
lips
of
their
waking
time
can
be
spared
from
the
gathering
and
eating
of
the
is
spent
in
singing
choric
songs
in
honour
of
the
great
sloth
and
even
this
time
is
short
for
such
is
his
influence
on
the
somnolentians
that
when
he
sleeps
they
sleep
too
and
added
noah
impressively
sleeps
almost
all
the
time
your
deed
is
to
devise
some
means
of
keeping
the
great
sloth
awake
and
busy
and
i
think
got
your
work
cut
out
when
you
disposed
of
the
great
sloth
you
can
report
yourself
to
me
here
i
shall
remain
here
for
some
little
time
i
need
a
holiday
the
parrot
will
accompany
you
it
knows
its
way
about
as
well
as
any
bird
in
the
land
and
good
luck
you
will
excuse
my
not
being
down
to
breakfast
and
the
next
morning
philip
and
lucy
and
the
parrot
went
aboard
the
yacht
and
loosed
her
from
her
moorings
and
lucy
showed
philip
how
to
steer
and
the
parrot
sat
on
the
mast
and
called
out
instructions
they
made
for
the
mouth
of
a
river
never
built
a
river
said
philip
said
the
parrot
came
out
of
the
poetry
book
and
when
they
were
hungry
they
let
down
the
anchor
and
went
into
the
cabin
for
breakfast
and
two
people
sprang
to
meet
them
almost
knocking
lucy
down
with
the
violence
of
their
welcome
the
two
people
were
max
and
brenda
illustration
he
induced
them
to
build
him
a
temple
of
solid
gold
you
dear
dogs
lucy
cried
and
philip
patted
them
one
with
each
hand
did
you
get
here
was
a
little
surprise
of
noah
said
the
parrot
max
and
brenda
whined
and
barked
and
gushed
wish
we
could
understand
what
they
saying
said
lucy
you
only
knew
the
magic
word
that
the
hippogriff
obeys
said
the
parrot
could
say
it
and
then
you
understand
all
animal
talk
only
of
course
i
must
tell
it
you
it
one
of
the
eleven
mysteries
i
know
it
said
philip
and
at
once
breathed
the
word
in
the
tiny
silky
ear
of
brenda
and
then
in
the
longer
silkier
ear
of
max
and
instantly
my
dears
they
heard
brenda
say
in
a
softly
shrill
excited
voice
my
dearie
dears
we
so
pleased
to
see
you
i
only
a
poor
little
faithful
doggy
i
not
clever
you
know
but
my
affectionate
nature
makes
me
almost
mad
with
joy
to
see
my
dear
master
and
mistress
again
glad
to
see
you
sir
said
max
with
heavy
politeness
hope
you
be
comfortable
here
there
no
comfort
for
a
dog
like
being
with
his
master
and
with
that
he
sat
down
and
went
to
sleep
and
the
others
had
breakfast
it
is
rather
fun
cooking
in
yachts
and
there
was
something
new
and
charming
in
brenda
delicate
way
of
sitting
up
and
begging
and
saying
at
the
same
time
do
to
bother
my
darling
master
and
mistress
but
if
you
spare
another
bit
of
bacon
oh
how
good
and
generous
you
are
they
sailed
the
yacht
successfully
into
the
river
which
presently
ran
into
the
shadow
of
a
tropical
forest
also
out
of
a
book
might
go
on
during
the
night
said
the
parrot
the
dogs
would
steer
under
my
directions
you
could
tie
one
end
of
a
rope
to
their
collars
and
another
to
the
helm
it
easier
than
turning
spits
said
max
of
course
it
understood
that
we
sleep
through
the
day
course
said
everybody
so
that
was
settled
and
the
children
went
to
bed
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
night
that
the
parrot
roused
philip
with
his
usual
gentle
then
up
it
said
is
not
the
right
river
it
not
the
right
direction
nothing
right
the
ship
all
wrong
i
very
much
afraid
some
one
has
been
opening
a
book
and
this
river
has
got
out
philip
hurried
out
on
deck
and
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
from
the
cabin
gazed
out
at
the
banks
of
the
river
at
least
he
looked
for
them
but
there
were
any
banks
instead
steep
and
rugged
cliffs
rose
on
each
side
and
overhead
instead
of
a
starry
sky
was
a
great
arched
roof
of
a
cavern
glistening
with
moisture
and
dark
as
a
feathers
must
turn
back
said
philip
do
like
this
at
all
said
the
parrot
is
no
room
to
turn
back
and
the
is
not
constructed
for
going
backwards
dear
whispered
brenda
wish
we
had
come
dear
little
dogs
ought
to
be
taken
comfortable
care
of
and
not
be
sent
out
on
nasty
ships
that
ca
turn
back
when
it
dangerous
dear
said
max
with
slow
firmness
little
dogs
ca
help
themselves
now
so
they
had
better
look
out
for
chances
of
helping
their
masters
what
can
we
then
said
philip
impatiently
fear
said
the
parrot
we
can
do
nothing
but
go
straight
on
if
this
river
is
in
a
book
it
will
come
out
somewhere
no
river
in
a
book
ever
runs
underground
and
stays
there
sha
wake
lucy
said
philip
might
be
frightened
need
said
lucy
awake
and
she
no
more
frightened
than
you
are
hear
that
said
max
to
brenda
take
example
by
her
my
dear
if
we
are
going
the
wrong
way
we
sha
reach
the
great
sloth
lucy
went
on
or
later
one
way
or
another
we
shall
come
to
him
said
the
parrot
time
is
of
no
importance
to
a
great
sloth
it
was
now
very
cold
and
our
travellers
were
glad
to
wrap
themselves
in
the
flags
of
all
nations
with
which
the
yacht
was
handsomely
provided
philip
made
a
sort
of
tabard
of
the
union
jack
and
the
old
royal
arms
of
england
with
the
lilies
and
leopards
and
lucy
wore
the
japanese
flag
as
a
shawl
she
said
the
picture
of
the
sun
on
it
made
her
feel
warm
but
philip
shivered
under
his
complicated
crosses
and
lions
as
the
swept
on
over
the
dark
tide
between
the
dark
walls
and
under
the
dark
roof
of
the
cavern
up
said
the
parrot
what
a
lot
of
adventures
having
that
no
one
else
has
ever
had
think
what
a
lot
of
things
have
to
tell
the
other
boys
when
you
go
to
school
other
boys
would
believe
a
word
of
it
said
philip
in
gloom
would
unless
i
knew
it
was
true
i
think
is
said
lucy
watching
the
yellow
light
from
the
lamps
rushing
ahead
along
the
roof
we
sha
want
to
tell
people
be
just
enough
to
know
it
ourselves
and
talk
about
it
just
philip
and
me
together
as
to
that
the
parrot
was
beginning
doubtfully
when
he
broke
off
to
exclaim
my
claws
deceive
me
or
is
there
a
curious
vibration
and
noticeable
acceleration
of
velocity
said
philip
which
is
not
manners
and
he
knew
it
means
said
max
stolidly
we
going
rather
fast
and
rather
wobbly
we
certainly
were
the
was
going
faster
and
faster
along
that
subterranean
channel
and
every
now
and
then
gave
a
lurch
and
a
shiver
whined
brenda
is
a
dreadful
place
for
dear
little
dogs
said
lucy
in
a
low
voice
know
something
is
going
to
happen
something
dreadful
we
friends
are
we
said
philip
firmly
i
wish
you
kiss
me
can
like
you
just
as
much
without
that
said
philip
uneasily
people
it
silly
do
you
think
kissed
me
since
daddy
went
away
she
said
helen
and
you
do
mind
kissing
helen
she
you
were
going
to
adopt
me
for
your
sister
all
right
said
philip
and
put
his
arm
round
her
and
kissed
her
she
felt
so
little
and
helpless
and
bony
in
his
arm
that
he
suddenly
felt
sorry
for
her
kissed
her
again
more
kindly
and
then
withdrawing
his
arm
thumped
her
hearteningly
on
the
back
a
man
he
said
in
tones
of
comradeship
and
encouragement
perfectly
certain
nothing
going
to
happen
we
just
going
through
a
tunnel
and
presently
we
shall
just
come
out
into
the
open
air
again
with
the
sky
and
the
stars
going
on
as
usual
he
spoke
this
standing
on
the
prow
beside
lucy
and
as
he
spoke
she
clutched
his
arm
look
she
breathed
listen
he
listened
and
he
heard
a
dull
echoing
roar
that
got
louder
and
louder
and
he
looked
the
light
of
the
lamps
shone
ahead
on
the
dark
gleaming
water
and
then
quite
suddenly
it
did
not
shine
on
the
water
because
there
was
no
longer
any
water
for
it
to
shine
on
only
great
empty
black
darkness
a
great
hole
ahead
into
which
the
stream
poured
itself
and
now
they
were
at
the
edge
of
the
gulf
the
gave
a
shudder
and
a
bound
and
hung
for
what
seemed
a
long
moment
on
the
edge
of
the
precipice
down
which
the
underground
river
was
pouring
itself
in
a
smooth
sleek
stream
rather
like
poured
treacle
over
what
felt
like
the
edge
of
everything
solid
illustration
plunged
headlong
over
the
edge
the
moment
ended
and
the
little
yacht
with
philip
and
lucy
and
the
parrot
and
the
two
dogs
plunged
headlong
over
the
edge
into
the
dark
unknown
abyss
below
all
right
lu
said
philip
in
that
moment
take
care
of
you
and
then
there
was
silence
in
the
cavern
only
the
rushing
sound
of
the
great
waterfall
echoed
in
the
rocky
arch
chapter
x
the
great
sloth
you
have
heard
of
indians
shooting
rapids
in
their
canoes
and
perhaps
you
have
yourself
sailed
a
toy
boat
on
a
stream
and
made
a
dam
of
clay
and
waited
with
more
or
less
patience
till
the
water
rose
nearly
to
the
top
and
then
broken
a
bit
of
your
dam
out
and
made
a
waterfall
and
let
your
boat
drift
over
the
edge
of
it
you
know
how
it
goes
slowly
at
first
then
hesitates
and
sweeps
on
more
and
more
quickly
sometimes
it
upsets
and
sometimes
it
shudders
and
strains
and
trembles
and
sways
to
one
side
and
to
the
other
and
at
last
rights
itself
and
makes
up
its
mind
and
rushes
on
down
the
stream
usually
to
be
entangled
in
the
clump
of
rushes
at
the
stream
next
turn
this
is
what
happened
to
that
good
yacht
the
she
shot
over
the
edge
of
that
dark
smooth
subterranean
waterfall
hung
a
long
breathless
moment
between
still
air
and
falling
water
slid
down
like
a
flash
dashed
into
the
stream
below
shuddered
reeled
righted
herself
and
sped
on
you
have
perhaps
been
down
the
water
chute
at
earl
court
it
was
rather
like
that
it
all
right
said
philip
in
a
rather
shaky
whisper
going
on
all
right
said
lucy
holding
his
arm
very
tight
i
sure
she
going
on
all
right
we
drowned
said
a
trembling
squeak
max
are
we
really
drowned
do
think
so
max
replied
with
caution
if
we
are
my
dear
we
can
not
undrown
ourselves
by
screams
from
it
said
the
parrot
who
had
for
the
moment
been
rendered
quite
speechless
by
the
shock
and
you
know
a
parrot
is
not
made
speechless
just
by
any
little
thing
we
may
just
as
well
try
to
behave
it
said
the
lamps
had
certainly
behaved
and
behaved
beautifully
through
the
wild
air
of
the
fall
the
wild
splash
as
the
struck
the
stream
below
the
lamps
had
shone
on
seemingly
undisturbed
example
to
us
all
said
the
parrot
but
said
lucy
are
we
to
do
adventures
take
a
turn
one
is
far
from
expecting
one
does
what
one
can
said
the
parrot
what
that
said
the
parrot
has
relieved
max
at
the
helm
and
is
steering
a
straight
course
between
the
banks
if
you
can
call
them
banks
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
done
there
plainly
was
the
rushed
on
through
the
darkness
lucy
reflected
for
a
moment
and
then
made
cocoa
this
was
real
heroism
it
cheered
every
one
up
including
the
herself
it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
anything
dreadful
was
going
to
happen
when
you
were
making
that
soft
sweet
ordinary
drink
say
philip
remarked
when
she
carried
a
cup
to
him
at
the
wheel
been
thinking
all
this
is
out
of
a
book
some
one
must
have
let
it
out
i
know
what
book
it
out
of
too
and
if
the
whole
story
got
out
of
the
book
we
all
right
only
we
shall
go
on
for
ages
and
climb
out
at
last
three
days
journey
from
trieste
see
said
lucy
and
added
that
she
hated
geography
your
cocoa
while
it
hot
she
said
in
motherly
accents
and
book
is
it
last
cruise
of
the
he
said
gave
it
me
just
before
she
went
away
it
a
ripping
book
and
i
used
it
for
the
roof
of
the
outer
court
of
the
hall
of
justice
i
remember
it
perfectly
the
chaps
on
the
made
torches
of
paper
soaked
in
paraffin
have
any
said
lucy
our
lamps
light
everything
up
all
right
oh
there
brenda
crying
again
she
has
a
shadow
of
pluck
she
went
quickly
to
the
cabin
where
max
was
trying
to
cheer
brenda
by
remarks
full
of
solid
good
sense
to
which
brenda
paid
no
attention
whatever
knew
how
it
would
be
she
kept
saying
in
a
whining
voice
told
you
so
from
the
beginning
i
wish
we
had
come
i
want
to
go
home
oh
what
a
dreadful
thing
to
happen
to
dear
little
dogs
said
lucy
firmly
you
do
stop
whining
you
sha
have
any
cocoa
brenda
stopped
at
once
and
wagged
her
tail
appealingly
she
said
any
one
say
cocoa
my
nerves
are
so
delicate
i
know
i
a
trial
dear
max
it
no
use
your
pretending
i
not
but
there
is
nothing
like
cocoa
for
the
nerves
plenty
of
sugar
please
dear
lucy
thank
you
much
yes
it
as
i
like
it
will
be
other
things
to
eat
by
and
by
said
lucy
who
whine
wo
get
any
sure
nobody
would
of
whining
said
brenda
know
i
too
sensitive
but
you
can
do
anything
with
dear
little
dogs
by
kindness
and
as
for
whining
do
you
know
it
a
thing
i
never
been
subject
to
from
a
child
never
max
will
tell
you
the
same
max
said
nothing
but
only
fixed
his
beautiful
eyes
hopefully
on
the
cocoa
jug
and
all
the
time
the
yacht
was
speeding
along
the
underground
stream
beneath
the
vast
arch
of
the
underground
cavern
worst
of
it
is
we
may
be
going
ever
so
far
away
from
where
we
want
to
get
to
said
philip
when
max
had
undertaken
the
steering
again
roads
remarked
the
parrot
to
somnolentia
and
besides
the
ship
is
travelling
due
north
at
least
so
the
ship
compass
states
and
i
have
no
reason
as
yet
for
doubting
its
word
cried
more
than
one
voice
and
the
ship
shot
out
of
the
dark
cavern
into
a
sheet
of
water
that
lay
spread
under
a
white
dome
the
stream
that
had
brought
them
there
seemed
to
run
across
one
side
of
this
pool
max
directed
by
the
parrot
steered
the
ship
into
smooth
water
where
she
lay
at
rest
at
last
in
the
very
middle
of
this
great
underground
lake
is
out
of
cruise
of
the
said
philip
must
have
shut
that
book
think
it
out
of
a
book
about
mexico
or
peru
or
ingots
or
some
geographical
place
said
lucy
had
a
binding
i
think
you
used
it
for
the
other
end
of
the
outer
justice
court
and
if
you
did
this
dome
solid
silver
and
there
a
hole
in
it
and
under
this
dome
there
untold
treasure
in
gold
incas
incas
bars
i
believe
said
lucy
mexicans
come
down
through
the
hole
in
the
roof
and
get
it
and
when
enemies
come
they
flood
it
with
water
it
flooded
now
she
added
unnecessarily
wish
adventures
had
never
been
invented
said
brenda
dear
lucy
i
am
not
whining
far
from
it
but
if
a
dear
little
dog
might
suggest
it
we
should
all
be
better
in
a
home
should
we
not
all
eyes
now
perceived
a
dark
hole
in
the
roof
a
round
hole
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
shining
dome
and
as
they
gazed
the
dark
hole
became
light
and
they
saw
above
them
a
white
shining
disk
like
a
very
large
and
very
bright
moon
it
was
the
light
of
day
one
has
opened
the
said
lucy
ingots
always
closed
their
with
the
bright
disk
was
obscured
confused
shapes
broke
its
shining
roundness
then
another
disk
small
and
very
black
appeared
in
the
middle
of
it
the
black
disk
grew
larger
and
larger
and
larger
it
was
coming
down
to
them
slowly
and
steadily
it
came
now
it
reached
the
level
of
the
dome
now
it
hung
below
it
down
down
down
it
came
past
the
level
of
their
eager
eyes
and
splashed
in
the
water
close
by
the
ship
it
was
a
large
empty
bucket
the
rope
which
held
it
was
jerked
from
above
the
bucket
dipped
and
filled
and
was
drawn
up
again
slowly
and
steadily
till
it
disappeared
in
the
hole
in
the
roof
said
the
parrot
the
ship
exactly
under
the
hole
and
next
time
the
bucket
comes
down
you
can
go
up
in
it
is
out
of
the
i
think
said
lucy
when
the
yacht
was
directly
under
the
hole
in
the
roof
who
is
it
that
keeps
on
opening
the
books
somebody
must
be
pulling
polistopolis
down
pretenderette
i
should
wonder
said
philip
gloomily
is
the
deliverer
so
she
must
be
the
destroyer
nobody
else
can
get
into
polistarchia
you
know
me
you
deliverer
too
you
said
lucy
gratefully
there
helen
was
only
on
the
island
you
know
she
could
come
to
polistarchia
look
out
the
bucket
was
descending
again
and
instead
of
splashing
in
the
water
it
bumped
on
the
deck
go
first
said
philip
to
lucy
you
said
max
to
brenda
i
go
first
if
you
like
said
philip
said
max
go
first
if
you
like
brenda
you
see
philip
felt
that
he
ought
to
give
lucy
the
first
chance
of
escaping
from
the
poor
yet
he
could
not
be
at
all
sure
what
it
was
that
she
would
be
escaping
to
and
if
there
was
danger
overhead
of
course
he
ought
to
be
the
one
to
go
first
to
face
it
and
the
worthy
max
felt
the
same
about
brenda
and
lucy
felt
just
the
same
as
they
did
i
do
know
what
brenda
felt
she
whined
a
little
then
for
one
moment
lucy
and
philip
stood
on
the
deck
each
grasping
the
handle
of
the
bucket
and
looking
at
each
other
and
the
dogs
looked
at
them
and
the
parrot
looked
at
every
one
in
turn
an
impatient
jerk
and
shake
of
the
rope
from
above
reminded
them
that
there
was
no
time
to
lose
lucy
decided
that
it
was
more
dangerous
to
go
than
to
stay
just
at
the
same
moment
when
philip
decided
that
it
was
more
dangerous
to
stay
than
to
go
so
when
lucy
stepped
into
the
bucket
philip
helped
her
eagerly
max
thought
the
same
as
philip
and
i
am
afraid
brenda
agreed
with
them
at
any
rate
she
leaped
into
lucy
lap
and
curled
her
long
length
round
just
as
the
rope
tightened
and
the
bucket
began
to
go
up
brenda
screamed
faintly
but
her
scream
was
stifled
at
once
send
the
bucket
down
again
the
moment
i
get
up
lucy
called
out
and
a
moment
later
feels
awfully
jolly
like
a
swing
and
so
saying
she
was
drawn
up
into
the
hole
in
the
roof
of
the
dome
then
a
sound
of
voices
came
down
the
shaft
a
confused
sound
the
anxious
little
party
on
the
could
not
make
out
any
distinct
words
they
all
stood
staring
up
expecting
waiting
for
the
bucket
to
come
down
again
hate
leaving
the
ship
said
philip
shall
be
the
last
to
leave
her
said
the
parrot
consolingly
is
if
we
can
manage
about
max
without
your
having
to
sit
on
him
in
the
bucket
if
he
gets
in
first
how
about
you
said
philip
illustration
the
bucket
began
to
go
up
a
little
arrogantly
the
parrot
unfolded
half
a
bright
wing
said
philip
enlightened
and
reminded
course
and
you
might
have
flown
away
at
any
time
and
yet
you
stuck
to
us
i
say
you
know
that
was
jolly
decent
of
you
at
all
said
the
parrot
with
conscious
modesty
it
was
philip
insisted
might
have
hullo
cried
philip
the
bucket
came
down
again
with
a
horrible
rush
they
held
their
breaths
and
looked
to
see
the
form
of
lucy
hurtling
through
the
air
but
no
the
bucket
swung
loose
a
moment
in
then
it
was
hastily
drawn
up
and
a
hollow
metallic
clang
echoed
through
the
cavern
the
cry
was
wrung
from
the
heart
of
the
sober
max
wings
and
claws
exclaimed
the
parrot
bother
said
philip
there
was
some
excuse
for
these
expressions
of
emotion
the
white
disk
overhead
had
suddenly
disappeared
some
one
up
above
had
banged
the
lid
down
and
all
the
manly
hearts
were
below
in
the
cave
and
brave
lucy
and
helpless
brenda
were
above
in
a
strange
place
whose
dangers
those
below
could
only
imagine
wish
gone
said
philip
i
i
gone
indeed
said
max
with
a
deep
sigh
feel
a
little
faint
said
the
parrot
some
one
would
make
a
cup
of
cocoa
thus
did
the
excellent
bird
seek
to
occupy
their
minds
in
that
first
moment
of
disaster
and
it
was
well
that
the
captain
and
crew
were
thus
saved
from
despair
for
before
the
kettle
boiled
the
lid
of
the
shaft
opened
about
a
foot
and
something
largeish
roundish
and
lumpish
fell
heavily
and
bounced
upon
the
deck
of
the
it
was
a
fresh
ripe
and
juicy
on
its
side
was
carved
in
large
letters
of
uncertain
shape
the
one
word
it
was
good
advice
and
they
took
it
really
i
do
not
see
what
else
they
could
have
done
in
any
case
and
they
ate
the
and
presently
every
one
felt
extremely
sleepy
is
one
of
those
things
that
you
can
do
as
well
asleep
as
awake
or
even
better
said
the
parrot
winks
will
do
us
all
the
good
in
the
world
he
put
his
head
under
his
wing
where
he
sat
on
the
binnacle
i
turn
in
alongside
you
sir
max
asked
sha
feel
the
dreadful
loneliness
so
much
then
so
philip
and
max
curled
up
together
on
the
deck
warmly
covered
with
the
spare
flags
of
all
nations
and
the
forty
winks
lasted
for
the
space
of
a
good
night
rest
about
ten
hours
in
fact
so
ten
hours
waiting
was
got
through
quite
easily
but
there
was
more
waiting
to
do
after
they
woke
up
and
that
was
not
so
easy
when
lucy
sitting
in
the
bucket
with
brenda
in
her
lap
felt
the
bucket
lifted
from
the
deck
and
swung
loose
in
the
air
it
was
as
much
as
she
could
do
to
refrain
from
screaming
brenda
scream
as
you
know
but
lucy
stifled
the
sound
in
the
folds
of
her
frock
lucy
bit
her
lips
made
a
great
effort
and
called
out
that
remark
about
the
just
as
though
she
were
quite
comfortable
it
was
very
brave
of
her
and
helped
her
to
go
on
being
brave
the
bucket
drew
slowly
up
and
up
and
up
and
passed
from
the
silver
dome
into
the
dark
shaft
above
lucy
looked
up
yes
it
was
daylight
that
showed
at
the
top
of
the
shaft
and
the
rope
was
drawing
her
up
towards
it
suppose
the
rope
broke
brenda
was
quite
quiet
now
she
said
afterwards
that
she
must
have
fainted
and
now
the
light
was
nearer
and
nearer
now
lucy
was
in
it
for
the
bucket
had
been
drawn
right
up
and
hands
were
reached
out
to
draw
it
over
the
side
of
what
seemed
like
a
well
at
that
moment
lucy
saw
in
a
flash
what
might
happen
if
the
owners
of
the
hands
in
their
surprise
let
go
the
bucket
and
the
windlass
she
caught
brenda
in
her
hands
and
threw
the
dog
out
on
to
the
dry
ground
and
threw
herself
across
the
well
parapet
just
in
time
for
a
shout
of
surprise
went
up
and
the
bucket
went
down
clanging
against
the
well
sides
the
hands
let
go
lucy
clambered
over
the
well
side
slowly
and
when
her
feet
stood
on
firm
ground
she
saw
that
the
hands
were
winding
up
the
bucket
again
and
that
it
came
very
easily
do
she
said
it
go
right
down
there
are
some
more
people
down
there
but
it
against
the
rules
the
bucket
only
goes
down
this
well
forty
times
a
day
and
that
was
the
fortieth
time
they
pulled
the
bucket
in
and
banged
down
the
lid
of
the
well
some
one
padlocked
it
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
and
lucy
and
he
stood
facing
each
other
he
was
a
little
man
in
a
curious
stiff
red
tunic
and
there
was
something
about
the
general
shape
of
him
and
his
tunic
which
reminded
lucy
of
something
only
she
could
not
remember
what
behind
him
stood
two
others
also
and
illustration
lucy
threw
herself
across
the
well
parapet
brenda
crouched
at
lucy
feet
and
whined
softly
and
lucy
waited
for
the
strangers
to
speak
should
do
that
said
the
man
at
last
was
a
great
shock
to
us
your
bobbing
up
as
you
did
it
will
keep
us
awake
at
night
just
remembering
it
sorry
said
lucy
should
always
come
into
strange
towns
by
the
front
gate
said
the
man
to
remember
that
will
you
you
not
going
off
like
this
said
lucy
me
write
a
note
and
drop
it
down
to
the
others
have
you
a
bit
of
pencil
and
paper
said
the
strange
people
staring
at
her
you
anything
i
can
write
on
lucy
asked
them
nothing
here
but
said
one
of
them
at
last
so
she
cut
a
from
among
the
hundreds
that
grew
among
the
rocks
near
by
and
carved
on
it
with
her
penknife
she
said
that
well
lid
as
much
as
our
lives
are
worth
said
the
leader
it
is
said
lucy
no
law
against
dropping
into
the
well
you
know
there
is
it
is
like
drawing
water
and
if
you
do
i
shall
set
my
little
dog
at
you
she
is
very
fierce
brenda
was
so
flattered
that
she
showed
her
teeth
and
growled
very
well
said
the
stranger
to
avoid
fuss
when
the
well
lid
was
padlocked
down
again
lucy
said
country
is
this
though
she
was
almost
sure
because
of
the
that
it
was
somnolentia
and
when
they
had
said
that
word
she
said
i
tell
you
something
the
deliverer
is
coming
up
that
well
next
time
you
draw
water
he
is
coming
to
deliver
you
from
the
bondage
of
the
great
sloth
is
true
said
the
red
leader
we
are
in
bondage
and
the
great
sloth
wearies
us
with
the
singing
of
choric
songs
when
we
long
to
be
asleep
but
none
can
deliver
us
there
is
no
hope
there
is
nothing
good
but
sleep
and
of
that
we
have
never
enough
dear
said
lucy
despairingly
there
any
women
here
they
always
have
more
sense
than
men
you
say
is
rude
as
well
as
untrue
said
the
red
leader
to
avoid
fuss
we
will
lead
you
and
your
fierce
dog
to
the
huts
of
the
women
and
then
perhaps
you
will
allow
us
to
go
to
sleep
the
huts
were
poor
and
mean
little
corners
in
the
ruins
of
what
had
once
been
a
great
and
beautiful
city
with
gardens
and
streams
but
now
the
streams
were
dry
and
nothing
grew
in
the
gardens
but
weeds
and
but
the
women
who
all
wore
green
tunics
of
the
same
stiff
shape
as
the
men
were
not
quite
so
sleepy
as
their
husbands
they
brought
lucy
fresh
to
eat
and
were
dreamily
interested
in
the
cut
of
her
clothes
and
the
begging
accomplishments
of
brenda
and
from
the
women
she
learned
several
things
about
the
somnolentians
they
all
wore
the
same
shaped
tunics
only
the
colours
differed
the
women
were
green
the
drawers
of
water
wore
red
the
attendants
of
the
great
sloth
wore
black
and
the
gatherers
wore
yellow
and
as
lucy
sat
at
the
door
of
the
hut
and
watched
the
people
in
these
four
colours
going
lazily
about
among
the
ruins
she
suddenly
knew
what
they
were
and
she
exclaimed
know
what
you
are
you
halma
men
instantly
every
man
within
earshot
made
haste
to
get
away
and
the
women
whispered
it
is
death
to
breathe
that
name
why
lucy
asked
was
the
great
captain
of
our
race
said
the
woman
the
great
sloth
fears
that
if
we
hear
his
name
it
will
rouse
us
and
we
shall
break
from
bondage
and
become
once
more
a
free
people
lucy
determined
that
they
should
hear
that
name
pretty
often
but
before
she
could
speak
it
again
the
woman
sighed
and
remarking
great
sloth
sleeps
fell
asleep
then
and
there
over
the
she
was
peeling
a
vast
silence
settled
on
the
city
and
next
moment
lucy
also
slept
she
slept
for
hours
it
took
her
some
time
to
find
the
keeper
of
the
padlock
key
and
when
she
had
found
him
he
refused
to
use
it
nothing
would
move
him
not
even
the
threat
of
the
fierceness
of
brenda
at
last
almost
in
despair
lucy
suddenly
remembered
a
word
of
power
command
you
to
open
the
well
and
let
down
the
bucket
she
said
command
you
by
the
great
name
of
halma
is
death
to
speak
that
name
said
the
keeper
of
the
key
looking
over
his
shoulder
anxiously
is
life
to
speak
that
name
said
lucy
halma
halma
if
you
do
open
that
well
i
carve
the
name
on
a
and
send
it
in
on
the
golden
tray
with
the
great
sloth
dinner
would
have
the
lives
of
hundreds
for
that
said
the
keeper
in
horror
the
well
then
said
lucy
they
all
held
a
council
as
soon
as
philip
and
max
had
been
safely
drawn
up
in
the
bucket
and
lucy
told
them
all
she
knew
think
whatever
we
do
we
ought
to
be
quick
said
lucy
great
sloth
is
dangerous
i
sure
it
is
it
sent
already
to
say
i
am
to
be
brought
to
its
presence
to
sing
songs
to
it
while
it
goes
to
sleep
it
does
mind
me
because
it
knows
i
not
the
deliverer
and
if
let
me
i
believe
i
can
work
everything
all
right
but
if
it
knows
you
here
it
be
much
harder
the
degraded
halma
men
were
watching
them
from
a
distance
in
whispering
groups
shall
go
and
sing
to
the
great
sloth
she
said
you
must
go
about
and
say
the
name
of
power
to
every
one
you
meet
and
tell
them
you
the
deliverer
then
if
my
idea
does
come
off
we
must
overpower
the
great
sloth
by
numbers
and
you
just
go
about
saying
halma
see
you
do
the
dangerous
part
likely
said
philip
not
dangerous
it
never
hurts
the
people
who
sing
never
said
lucy
i
going
and
she
went
before
philip
could
stop
her
her
go
said
the
parrot
is
a
wise
child
the
temple
of
the
great
sloth
was
built
of
solid
gold
it
had
beautiful
pillars
and
doorways
and
windows
and
courts
one
inside
the
other
each
paved
with
gold
flagstones
and
in
the
very
middle
of
everything
was
a
large
room
which
was
entirely
there
the
great
sloth
passed
its
useless
life
in
eating
sleeping
and
listening
to
music
outside
the
moorish
arch
that
led
to
this
inner
room
lucy
stopped
and
began
to
sing
she
had
a
clear
little
voice
and
she
sang
to
the
fair
and
one
morning
and
then
she
stopped
and
a
great
sleepy
slobbery
voice
came
out
from
the
room
and
said
songs
are
in
very
bad
taste
do
you
know
no
sleepy
songs
people
sing
you
sleepy
songs
said
lucy
a
pity
they
sing
to
you
all
the
time
have
a
sympathetic
nature
said
the
great
sloth
and
it
came
out
and
leaned
on
the
pillar
of
its
door
and
looked
at
her
with
sleepy
interest
it
was
enormous
as
big
as
a
young
elephant
and
it
walked
on
its
hind
legs
like
a
gorilla
it
was
very
black
indeed
a
pity
it
said
they
say
they
can
not
live
without
drinking
so
they
waste
their
time
in
drawing
water
from
the
wells
it
be
nice
said
lucy
you
had
a
machine
for
drawing
water
then
they
could
sing
to
you
all
day
if
they
chose
chose
said
the
great
sloth
yawning
like
a
hippopotamus
am
sleepy
go
said
lucy
and
it
was
so
long
since
the
great
sloth
had
heard
that
word
that
the
shock
of
the
sound
almost
killed
its
sleepiness
did
you
say
it
asked
as
if
it
could
not
believe
its
large
ears
said
no
said
lucy
mean
that
you
are
so
great
and
grand
you
have
only
to
wish
for
anything
and
you
get
it
that
so
said
the
great
sloth
dreamily
and
like
an
american
said
lucy
with
firmness
just
say
i
wish
i
had
a
machine
to
draw
up
water
for
eight
hours
a
day
that
the
proper
length
for
a
working
day
father
says
so
it
all
again
and
slower
said
the
creature
did
quite
catch
what
you
said
lucy
repeated
the
words
that
all
said
the
great
sloth
say
it
again
very
slowly
indeed
lucy
did
so
and
the
great
sloth
repeated
after
her
wish
i
had
a
machine
to
draw
up
water
for
eight
hours
a
day
it
said
angrily
looking
back
over
its
shoulder
into
the
room
i
say
where
are
you
shoving
to
who
are
you
what
are
you
doing
in
my
room
come
out
of
it
something
did
come
out
of
the
room
pushing
the
great
sloth
away
from
the
door
and
what
came
out
was
the
vast
in
enormous
rolls
and
swellings
and
bulges
it
was
being
pushed
out
by
something
so
big
and
strong
that
it
was
stronger
that
the
great
sloth
itself
and
pushed
that
mountain
of
lazy
half
across
its
own
inner
courtyard
lucy
retreated
before
its
advancing
bulk
and
its
extreme
rage
me
out
of
my
own
would
it
said
the
sloth
now
hardly
sleepy
at
all
wait
till
i
get
hold
of
it
whatever
it
is
the
whole
of
the
was
out
in
the
courtyard
now
and
the
great
sloth
climbed
slowly
back
over
it
into
its
room
to
find
out
who
had
dared
to
outrage
its
slothful
majesty
lucy
waited
breathless
with
hope
and
fear
as
the
great
sloth
blundered
back
into
the
inner
room
of
its
temple
it
did
not
come
out
again
there
was
a
silence
and
then
a
creaking
sound
and
the
voice
of
the
great
sloth
saying
no
no
i
wo
let
go
i
tell
you
then
more
sounds
of
creaking
and
the
sound
of
metal
on
metal
she
crept
to
the
arch
and
peeped
round
it
the
room
that
had
been
full
of
was
now
full
of
wheels
and
cogs
and
bands
and
screws
and
bars
it
was
full
in
fact
of
a
large
and
complicated
machine
and
the
handle
of
that
machine
was
being
turned
by
the
great
sloth
itself
me
go
said
the
great
sloth
gnashing
its
great
teeth
work
must
said
a
purring
voice
from
the
heart
of
the
machinery
wished
for
me
and
now
you
have
to
work
me
eight
hours
a
day
it
is
the
law
it
was
the
machine
itself
which
spoke
break
you
said
the
sloth
am
unbreakable
said
the
machine
with
gentle
pride
is
your
doing
said
the
sloth
turning
its
furious
eyes
on
lucy
in
the
doorway
wait
till
i
catch
you
and
all
the
while
it
had
to
go
on
turning
that
handle
you
said
lucy
politely
think
i
will
not
wait
and
i
shall
have
eight
hours
start
she
added
even
as
she
spoke
a
stream
of
clear
water
began
to
run
from
the
pumping
machine
it
slid
down
the
gold
steps
and
across
the
golden
court
lucy
ran
out
into
the
ruined
square
of
the
city
shouting
halma
halma
to
me
halma
men
and
the
men
already
excited
by
philip
who
had
gone
about
saying
that
name
of
power
without
a
moment
pause
all
the
time
lucy
had
been
in
the
golden
temple
gathered
round
her
in
a
crowd
she
said
great
sloth
is
pumping
water
up
for
you
he
will
pump
for
eight
hours
a
day
quick
dig
a
channel
for
the
water
to
run
in
the
deliverer
she
pointed
to
philip
given
you
back
your
river
some
ran
to
look
out
old
rusty
spades
and
picks
but
others
hesitated
and
said
great
sloth
will
work
for
eight
hours
and
then
it
will
be
free
to
work
vengeance
on
us
will
go
back
said
lucy
explain
to
it
that
if
it
does
not
behave
nicely
you
will
all
wish
for
machine
guns
and
it
knows
now
that
if
people
wish
for
machinery
they
have
to
use
it
it
will
be
awake
now
for
eight
hours
and
if
you
all
work
for
eight
hours
a
day
you
soon
have
your
city
as
fine
as
ever
and
there
one
new
law
every
time
the
clock
strikes
you
must
all
say
halma
aloud
every
one
of
you
to
remind
yourselves
of
your
great
destiny
and
that
you
are
no
longer
slaves
of
the
great
sloth
illustration
and
all
the
while
it
had
to
go
on
turning
that
handle
she
went
back
and
explained
machine
guns
very
carefully
to
the
now
sloth
when
she
came
back
all
the
men
were
at
work
digging
a
channel
for
the
new
river
the
women
and
children
crowded
round
lucy
and
philip
said
the
oldest
woman
of
all
we
shall
be
able
to
wash
in
water
i
heard
my
grandmother
say
water
was
very
pleasant
to
wash
in
i
never
thought
i
should
live
to
wash
in
water
myself
lucy
asked
do
you
wash
in
juice
said
a
dozen
voices
we
wash
that
must
be
very
sticky
said
lucy
is
said
the
oldest
woman
of
all
chapter
xi
the
night
attack
the
halma
men
were
not
naturally
lazy
they
were
in
the
days
before
the
coming
of
the
great
sloth
a
most
energetic
and
industrious
people
now
that
the
sloth
was
obliged
to
work
eight
hours
a
day
the
weight
of
its
constant
and
catching
sleepiness
was
taken
away
and
the
people
set
to
work
in
good
earnest
i
did
explain
did
i
that
the
great
sleepiness
really
was
catching
like
measles
so
now
the
halma
men
were
as
busy
as
ants
some
dug
the
channel
for
the
new
stream
some
set
to
work
to
restore
the
buildings
while
others
weeded
the
overgrown
gardens
and
ploughed
the
deserted
fields
the
head
halma
man
painted
in
large
letters
on
a
column
in
the
these
words
city
is
now
called
by
its
ancient
name
of
briskford
any
citizen
found
calling
it
somnolentia
will
not
be
allowed
to
wash
in
water
for
a
week
the
was
full
of
schemes
the
least
of
which
was
the
lighting
of
the
town
by
electricity
the
power
to
be
supplied
by
the
great
sloth
ca
go
on
pumping
eight
hours
a
day
said
the
can
easily
adjust
the
machine
to
all
sorts
of
other
uses
in
the
evening
a
banquet
was
of
course
given
to
the
deliverers
the
banquet
was
all
and
water
because
there
had
been
no
time
to
make
or
get
anything
else
but
the
speeches
were
very
flattering
and
philip
and
lucy
were
very
pleased
more
so
than
brenda
who
did
not
like
and
made
but
little
effort
to
conceal
her
disappointment
max
accepted
bits
of
out
of
politeness
and
hid
them
among
the
feet
of
the
guests
so
that
nobody
feelings
should
be
hurt
do
know
how
we
to
get
back
to
the
island
said
philip
next
day
we
lost
the
think
we
better
go
back
by
way
of
polistopolis
said
lucy
find
out
who
been
opening
the
books
if
they
go
on
they
may
let
simply
anything
out
and
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
perhaps
we
could
get
some
one
to
help
us
to
open
the
book
again
and
get
the
out
to
cross
to
the
island
in
said
philip
with
feeling
clever
really
clever
no
not
kidding
i
mean
it
and
i
sorry
i
ever
said
you
were
only
a
girl
but
how
are
we
to
get
to
polistopolis
it
was
a
difficult
problem
the
could
offer
no
suggestions
it
was
brenda
who
suggested
asking
the
advice
of
the
great
sloth
is
such
a
fine
figure
of
an
animal
she
said
admiringly
handsome
and
i
am
sure
he
must
have
a
really
great
mind
i
always
think
good
looks
go
with
really
great
minds
you
dear
lucy
might
as
well
said
philip
no
one
can
think
of
anything
else
no
one
could
so
they
decided
to
take
brenda
advice
now
that
the
sloth
worked
every
day
it
was
not
nearly
so
disagreeable
as
it
had
been
when
it
slept
so
much
the
children
approached
it
at
the
dinner
hour
and
it
listened
patiently
if
drowsily
to
their
question
when
it
had
quite
done
it
reflected
or
seemed
to
reflect
perhaps
it
had
fallen
asleep
until
the
town
clock
struck
one
the
time
for
resuming
work
then
it
got
up
and
slouched
towards
its
machine
it
said
and
began
to
turn
the
handle
of
its
wheel
they
had
to
wait
till
to
ask
it
what
it
meant
for
in
that
town
the
rule
about
not
speaking
to
the
man
at
the
wheel
was
strictly
enforced
the
sloth
repeated
and
added
a
careful
explanation
sit
on
the
end
of
any
young
cucumber
which
points
in
the
desired
direction
and
when
it
has
grown
to
its
full
length
say
sixteen
inches
why
then
you
are
sixteen
inches
on
your
way
that
not
much
said
lucy
little
helps
said
the
sloth
haste
less
speed
then
you
wait
till
the
cucumber
seeds
and
when
the
new
plants
grow
you
select
the
earliest
cucumber
that
points
in
the
desired
direction
and
take
your
seat
on
it
by
the
end
of
the
cucumber
season
you
will
be
another
sixteen
or
with
luck
seventeen
inches
on
your
way
inches
in
all
almost
a
yard
and
thus
you
progress
towards
your
goal
slowly
but
surely
like
in
politics
you
very
much
said
philip
will
think
it
over
but
it
did
not
need
much
thought
we
could
get
a
motor
car
said
philip
you
can
get
machines
by
wishing
for
them
very
thing
said
lucy
find
the
must
wish
for
a
motor
or
we
should
have
to
go
on
using
it
but
perhaps
some
one
here
who
like
to
drive
a
motor
for
his
living
you
know
there
was
a
halma
man
with
an
inborn
taste
for
machinery
had
long
pined
to
leave
the
gathering
of
to
others
he
was
induced
to
wish
for
a
motor
and
a
sixty
car
snorted
suddenly
in
the
place
where
a
moment
before
no
car
was
the
luxury
this
is
indeed
like
home
sighed
brenda
curling
up
on
the
and
the
children
certainly
felt
a
gloriously
restful
sensation
nothing
to
be
done
no
need
to
think
or
bother
just
to
sit
quiet
and
be
borne
swiftly
on
through
wonderful
cities
all
of
which
philip
vaguely
remembered
to
have
seen
small
and
near
and
built
by
his
own
hands
and
helen
and
so
at
last
they
came
close
to
polistopolis
philip
never
could
tell
how
it
was
that
he
stopped
the
car
outside
the
city
it
must
have
been
some
quite
unaccountable
instinct
because
naturally
you
know
when
you
are
not
used
to
being
driven
in
motors
you
like
to
dash
up
to
the
house
you
are
going
to
and
enjoy
your
friends
enjoyment
of
the
grand
way
in
which
you
have
travelled
but
philip
felt
in
that
quite
certain
and
quite
unexplainable
way
in
which
you
do
feel
things
sometimes
that
it
was
best
to
stop
the
car
among
the
suburban
groves
of
southernwood
and
to
creep
into
the
town
in
the
disguise
afforded
by
motor
coats
motor
veils
and
motor
goggles
for
of
course
all
these
had
come
with
the
motor
car
when
it
was
wished
for
because
no
motor
car
is
complete
without
them
illustration
philip
felt
that
it
was
best
to
stop
the
car
among
the
suburban
groves
of
southernwood
they
said
warmly
to
the
halma
motor
man
and
went
quietly
towards
the
town
max
and
brenda
keeping
to
heel
in
the
most
praiseworthy
way
and
the
parrot
nestling
inside
philip
jacket
for
it
was
chilled
by
the
long
rush
through
the
evening
air
and
now
the
scattered
houses
and
spacious
gardens
gave
place
to
the
streets
of
polistopolis
the
capital
of
the
kingdom
and
the
streets
were
strangely
deserted
the
children
both
felt
in
that
quite
certain
and
unexplainable
way
that
it
would
be
unwise
of
them
to
go
to
the
place
where
they
had
slept
the
last
time
they
were
in
that
city
the
whole
party
was
very
tired
max
walked
with
drooping
tail
and
brenda
was
whining
softly
to
herself
from
sheer
weariness
and
the
parrot
alone
was
happy
or
at
least
contented
because
it
was
asleep
at
the
corner
of
a
little
square
planted
with
in
tubs
philip
called
a
halt
shall
we
go
he
said
us
put
it
to
the
vote
and
even
as
he
spoke
he
saw
a
dark
form
creeping
along
in
the
shadow
of
the
houses
goes
there
philip
cried
with
proper
spirit
and
the
answer
surprised
him
all
the
more
that
it
was
given
with
a
kind
of
desperate
bravado
go
here
i
plumbeus
captain
of
the
old
guard
of
polistopolis
it
you
cried
philip
glad
you
can
advise
us
where
can
we
go
to
sleep
somehow
or
other
i
do
care
to
go
to
the
house
where
we
stayed
before
the
captain
made
no
answer
he
simply
caught
at
the
hands
of
lucy
and
philip
dragged
them
through
a
low
arched
doorway
and
as
soon
as
the
long
lengths
of
brenda
and
max
had
slipped
through
closed
the
door
he
said
in
a
breathless
way
which
made
philip
feel
that
safety
was
the
last
thing
one
could
count
on
at
that
moment
speak
low
who
knows
what
spies
may
be
listening
i
am
a
plain
man
i
speak
as
i
think
you
came
out
of
the
unknown
you
may
be
the
deliverer
or
the
destroyer
but
i
am
a
judge
of
faces
always
was
from
a
boy
and
i
can
not
believe
that
this
countenance
of
innocence
is
that
of
a
destroyer
philip
was
angry
and
lucy
was
furious
so
he
said
nothing
and
she
said
yourself
which
was
very
rude
see
that
you
are
annoyed
said
the
captain
in
the
dark
where
of
course
he
could
see
nothing
in
calling
your
friend
i
was
merely
offering
the
highest
compliment
in
my
power
the
absence
of
fruit
in
this
city
is
i
suppose
the
reason
why
our
compliments
are
like
that
i
believe
poets
say
sweet
as
a
rose
say
sweet
as
an
orange
may
i
be
allowed
unreservedly
to
apologise
that
all
right
said
philip
awkwardly
to
ask
whether
you
the
deliverer
hope
so
said
philip
modestly
course
he
is
said
the
parrot
putting
its
head
out
from
the
front
of
philip
jacket
he
has
done
six
deeds
out
of
the
seven
already
is
time
that
deeds
were
done
here
said
the
captain
make
a
light
and
get
you
some
supper
i
in
hiding
here
but
the
walls
are
thick
and
all
the
shutters
are
shut
he
bolted
a
door
and
opened
the
slide
of
a
dark
lantern
of
us
have
taken
refuge
in
the
old
prison
he
said
never
used
you
know
so
her
spies
do
infest
it
as
they
do
every
other
part
of
the
city
spies
destroyer
said
the
captain
getting
bread
and
milk
out
of
a
cupboard
least
if
you
the
deliverer
she
must
be
that
but
she
says
she
the
deliverer
he
lighted
candles
and
set
them
on
the
table
as
lucy
asked
eagerly
destroyer
is
it
a
horrid
woman
in
a
motor
veil
guessed
it
said
the
captain
gloomily
that
pretenderette
said
philip
noah
know
what
has
she
been
doing
you
can
think
of
said
the
captain
says
she
queen
and
that
she
done
the
seven
deeds
and
noah
does
know
because
she
set
a
guard
round
the
city
and
no
message
can
get
out
or
in
hippogriff
said
lucy
of
course
i
thought
of
that
said
the
captain
so
did
she
she
locked
it
up
and
thrown
the
key
into
one
of
the
municipal
wells
why
do
the
guards
obey
her
philip
asked
not
guards
of
course
the
captain
answered
strange
soldiers
that
she
got
out
of
a
book
she
got
the
people
to
pull
down
the
hall
of
justice
by
pretending
there
was
fruit
in
the
gigantic
books
it
built
with
and
when
the
book
was
opened
these
soldiers
came
marching
out
the
sequani
and
the
aedui
they
call
themselves
and
when
you
finished
supper
we
ought
to
hold
a
council
there
are
a
lot
of
us
here
all
sorts
distinctions
of
rank
are
forgotten
in
times
of
public
peril
some
twenty
or
thirty
people
presently
gathered
in
that
round
room
from
whose
windows
philip
and
lucy
had
looked
out
when
they
were
first
imprisoned
there
were
indeed
all
sorts
soldiers
noah
three
sons
and
his
wife
a
pirate
and
a
couple
of
sailors
book
philip
asked
lucy
in
an
undertone
she
get
these
soldiers
out
of
i
think
said
lucy
i
afraid
it
was
my
fault
i
remember
telling
her
about
the
barbarians
and
the
legions
and
things
after
father
had
told
me
when
she
was
my
nurse
you
know
she
very
clever
at
thinking
of
horrid
things
to
do
is
she
the
council
talked
for
two
hours
and
nobody
said
anything
worth
mentioning
when
every
one
was
quite
tired
out
every
one
went
to
bed
it
was
philip
who
woke
in
the
night
in
the
grasp
of
a
sudden
idea
is
it
asked
max
rousing
himself
from
his
warm
bed
at
feet
thought
of
something
said
philip
in
a
low
excited
voice
going
to
have
a
night
attack
i
wake
the
others
asked
max
ever
ready
to
oblige
philip
thought
a
moment
then
he
said
rather
dangerous
and
besides
i
want
to
do
it
all
by
myself
lucy
done
more
than
her
share
already
look
out
max
going
to
get
up
and
go
out
he
got
up
and
he
went
out
there
was
a
faint
greyness
of
dawn
now
which
showed
him
the
great
square
of
the
city
on
which
he
and
lucy
had
looked
from
the
prison
window
a
very
long
time
ago
as
it
seemed
he
found
without
difficulty
the
ruins
of
the
hall
of
justice
and
among
the
vast
blocks
scattered
on
the
ground
was
one
that
seemed
of
grey
marble
and
bore
on
its
back
in
gigantic
letters
of
gold
the
words
bello
philip
stole
back
to
the
prison
and
roused
the
captain
want
twenty
picked
men
he
said
boots
and
at
once
he
got
them
and
he
led
them
to
the
ruins
of
the
justice
hall
he
said
the
cover
of
this
book
only
the
cover
not
any
of
the
pages
the
men
set
their
shoulders
to
the
marble
slab
that
was
the
book
cover
and
heaved
it
up
and
as
it
rose
on
their
shoulders
philip
spoke
softly
urgently
he
said
and
a
voice
answered
from
under
the
marble
slab
calls
it
said
calls
upon
julius
caesar
and
from
the
space
below
the
slab
as
it
were
from
a
marble
tomb
a
thin
figure
stepped
out
clothed
in
toga
and
cloak
and
wearing
on
its
head
a
crown
of
bays
called
said
philip
in
a
voice
that
trembled
a
little
no
one
but
you
who
can
help
the
barbarians
of
gaul
hold
this
city
i
call
on
great
caesar
to
drive
them
away
no
one
else
can
help
us
caesar
stood
for
a
moment
silent
in
the
grey
twilight
then
he
spoke
will
do
it
he
said
have
often
tried
to
master
caesar
and
always
failed
now
you
shall
be
no
more
ashamed
of
that
failure
for
you
shall
see
caesar
power
bid
your
slaves
raise
the
leaves
of
my
book
to
the
number
of
fifteen
it
was
done
and
caesar
turned
towards
the
enormous
open
book
forth
he
said
forth
my
legions
then
something
in
the
book
moved
suddenly
and
out
of
it
as
out
of
an
open
marble
tomb
came
long
lines
of
silent
armed
men
ranged
themselves
in
ranks
and
passing
caesar
saluted
and
still
more
came
and
more
and
more
each
with
the
round
shield
and
the
shining
helmet
and
the
javelins
and
the
terrible
short
sword
and
on
their
backs
were
the
packages
they
used
to
carry
with
them
into
war
barbarians
of
gaul
are
loose
in
this
city
said
the
voice
of
the
great
commander
them
before
you
once
more
as
you
drove
them
of
old
o
caesar
asked
one
of
the
roman
generals
them
o
titus
labienus
said
caesar
into
that
book
wherein
i
set
them
more
than
nineteen
hundred
years
ago
and
from
which
they
have
dared
to
escape
who
is
their
leader
he
asked
of
philip
pretenderette
said
philip
woman
in
a
motor
veil

not

said
the
man
in
the
laurel
crown

taken
prisoner
and
brought
before
me
the
generals
of
caesar
army
gave
their
commands
and
with
incredible
quietness
the
army
moved
away
spreading
itself
out
in
all
directions

caged
the
hippogriff
said
philip
winged
horse
and
we
want
to
send
him
with
a
message
that
the
beast

said
caesar
and
turned
to
plumbeus
the
captain
be
soldiers
together
he
said
me
to
the
main
gate
it
is
there
that
the
fight
will
be
fiercest
he
laid
a
hand
on
the
captain
shoulder
and
at
the
head
of
the
last
legion
caesar
and
the
captain
of
the
soldiers
marched
to
the
main
gate
chapter
xii
the
end
philip
tore
back
to
the
prison
to
be
met
at
the
door
by
lucy
hate
you
she
said
briefly
and
philip
understood
could
help
it
he
said
did
want
to
do
something
by
myself
and
lucy
understood
besides
he
said
was
coming
back
for
you
do
be
snarky
about
it
lu
i
called
up
caesar
himself
and
you
shall
see
him
before
he
goes
back
into
the
book
come
on
if
we
sharp
we
can
hide
in
the
ruins
of
the
justice
hall
and
see
everything
i
noticed
there
was
a
bit
of
the
gallery
left
standing
come
on
i
want
you
to
think
what
message
to
send
by
the
hippogriff
to
mr
noah
you
need
trouble
about
that
said
lucy
in
an
manner
sent
the
parrot
off
ago
you
never
told
me
then
i
think
that
quits
do
you
lucy
had
a
short
struggle
with
herself
you
know
those
unpleasant
and
difficult
struggles
i
am
sure
and
said
and
together
they
ran
back
to
the
justice
hall
the
light
was
growing
every
moment
and
there
was
now
a
sound
of
movement
in
the
city
women
came
down
to
the
public
fountains
to
draw
water
and
boys
swept
the
paths
and
doorsteps
that
sort
of
work
goes
on
even
when
barbarians
are
surrounding
a
town
and
the
ordinary
sounds
of
a
town
awakening
came
to
lucy
and
philip
as
they
waited
crowing
cocks
and
barking
dogs
and
cats
mewing
faintly
for
the
morning
milk
but
it
was
not
for
those
sounds
that
lucy
and
philip
were
waiting
so
through
those
homely
and
familiar
sounds
they
listened
listened
listened
and
very
gradually
so
that
they
could
neither
of
them
have
said
at
any
moment
it
has
begun
yet
quite
beyond
mistake
the
sound
for
which
they
listened
was
presently
loud
in
their
ears
and
it
was
the
sound
of
steel
on
steel
the
sound
of
men
shouting
in
the
breathless
moment
between
and
the
cry
of
victory
and
the
wail
of
defeat
and
presently
the
sound
of
feet
that
ran
and
now
a
man
shot
out
from
a
side
street
and
ran
across
the
square
towards
the
palace
of
justice
where
lucy
and
philip
were
hidden
in
the
gallery
and
now
another
and
another
all
running
hard
and
making
for
the
ruined
hall
as
hunted
creatures
make
for
cover
rough
big
blond
their
long
hair
flying
behind
them
and
their
tunics
of
flapping
as
they
ran
the
barbarians
fled
before
the
legions
of
caesar
the
great
book
that
looked
like
a
marble
tomb
was
still
open
its
cover
and
fifteen
leaves
propped
up
against
the
tall
broken
columns
of
the
gateway
of
the
justice
hall
into
that
open
book
leapt
the
first
barbarian
leapt
and
vanished
and
the
next
after
him
and
the
next
and
then
by
twos
and
threes
and
sixes
and
sevens
they
leapt
in
and
disappeared
amid
gasping
and
shouting
and
the
nearing
sound
of
the
bucina
and
of
the
trumpets
of
rome
then
from
all
quarters
of
the
city
the
roman
soldiers
came
trooping
and
as
the
last
of
the
barbarians
plunged
headlong
into
the
open
book
the
romans
formed
into
ordered
lines
and
waited
while
a
man
might
count
ten
then
advancing
between
their
ranks
came
the
spare
form
and
thin
face
of
the
man
with
the
laurel
crown
illustration
they
leapt
in
and
disappeared
twelve
thousand
swords
flashed
in
air
and
wavered
a
little
like
reeds
in
the
breeze
then
steadied
themselves
and
the
shout
went
up
from
twelve
thousand
throats
caesar
and
without
haste
and
without
delay
the
romans
filed
through
the
ruins
to
the
book
and
two
by
two
entered
it
and
disappeared
each
as
he
passed
the
mighty
conqueror
saluted
him
with
proud
mute
reverence
when
the
last
soldier
was
hidden
in
the
book
caesar
looked
round
him
a
little
wistfully
must
speak
to
him
i
must
lucy
cried
oh
what
a
darling
he
is
she
ran
down
the
steps
from
the
gallery
and
straight
to
caesar
he
smiled
when
she
reached
him
and
gently
pinched
her
ear
fancy
going
through
the
rest
of
your
life
hearing
all
the
voices
of
the
world
through
an
ear
that
has
been
pinched
by
caesar
thank
you
thank
you
said
philip
splendid
you
are
swot
up
my
latin
like
anything
next
term
so
as
to
read
about
you
they
all
in
lucy
asked
do
hope
nobody
was
hurt
caesar
smiled
most
unreasonable
wish
my
child
after
a
great
battle
he
said
for
once
the
unreasonable
is
the
inevitable
nobody
was
hurt
you
see
it
was
necessary
to
get
every
man
back
into
the
book
just
as
he
left
it
or
what
would
the
schoolmasters
have
done
there
remain
now
only
my
own
guard
who
have
in
charge
the
false
woman
who
let
loose
the
barbarians
and
here
they
come
surrounded
by
a
guard
with
drawn
swords
the
pretenderette
advanced
slowly
woman
said
caesar
whoever
you
are
said
the
pretenderette
very
sulkily
hail
said
caesar
courage
philip
and
lucy
looked
at
each
other
yes
the
pretenderette
had
courage
they
had
not
thought
of
that
before
all
the
attempts
she
had
made
against
them
she
alone
in
a
strange
land
yes
these
needed
courage
i
demand
to
know
how
you
came
here
i
found
he
been
at
his
building
again
she
said
pointing
a
contemptuous
thumb
at
philip
was
just
going
to
pull
it
down
and
i
knocked
down
a
brick
or
two
with
my
sleeve
and
not
thinking
what
i
was
doing
i
built
them
up
again
and
then
i
got
a
bit
giddy
and
the
whole
thing
seemed
to
begin
to
grow
candlesticks
and
bricks
and
dominoes
and
everything
bigger
and
bigger
and
bigger
and
i
looked
in
it
was
as
big
as
a
church
by
this
time
and
i
saw
that
boy
losing
his
way
among
the
candlestick
pillars
and
i
followed
him
and
i
listened
and
i
thought
i
could
be
as
good
a
deliverer
as
anybody
else
and
the
motor
veil
that
i
was
going
to
catch
the
train
in
was
a
fine
disguise
tried
to
injure
the
children
caesar
reminded
her
do
want
to
say
anything
to
make
you
let
me
off
said
the
pretenderette
at
the
beginning
i
did
think
any
of
it
was
real
i
thought
it
was
a
dream
you
can
let
your
evil
passions
go
in
a
dream
and
it
do
hurt
any
one
hurts
you
caesar
said
that
no
odds
said
the
pretenderette
scornfully
sought
to
injure
and
confound
the
children
at
every
turn
said
caesar
when
you
found
that
things
were
real
saw
there
was
a
chance
of
being
queen
said
the
pretenderette
i
took
it
seems
to
me
you
no
occasion
to
talk
if
you
julius
caesar
the
same
as
the
bust
in
the
library
you
took
what
you
could
get
right
enough
in
your
time
when
all
said
and
done
hail
said
caesar
again
courage
need
trouble
she
said
tossing
her
head
game
up
now
and
i
speak
my
mind
if
i
die
for
it
you
do
understand
never
been
a
servant
to
see
other
people
get
all
the
fat
and
you
all
the
bones
what
you
think
it
like
to
know
if
you
just
been
born
in
a
gentleman
mansion
instead
of
in
a
model
workman
dwelling
you
have
been
brought
up
as
a
young
lady
and
had
the
openwork
silk
stockings
and
the
lace
on
your
go
too
deep
for
me
said
caesar
with
the
ghost
of
a
smile
now
pronounce
your
sentence
but
life
has
pronounced
on
you
a
sentence
worse
than
any
i
can
give
you
nobody
loves
you
you
old
silly
said
the
pretenderette
in
a
burst
of
angry
tears
you
see
that
just
why
everything
happened
are
condemned
said
caesar
calmly
make
yourself
beloved
you
will
be
taken
to
briskford
where
you
will
teach
the
great
sloth
to
like
his
work
and
keep
him
awake
for
eight
a
day
in
the
intervals
of
your
toil
you
must
try
to
get
fond
of
some
one
the
halma
people
are
kind
and
gentle
you
will
not
find
them
hard
to
love
and
when
the
great
sloth
loves
his
work
and
the
halma
people
are
so
fond
of
you
that
they
feel
they
can
not
bear
to
lose
you
your
penance
will
be
over
and
you
can
go
where
you
will
know
well
enough
said
the
pretenderette
still
tearful
and
furious
if
that
ever
happened
i
should
want
to
go
anywhere
else
said
caesar
slowly
know
lucy
would
have
liked
to
kiss
the
pretenderette
and
say
she
was
sorry
but
you
ca
do
that
when
it
is
all
other
people
fault
and
are
sorry
and
besides
before
all
these
people
it
would
have
looked
like
showing
off
you
know
i
am
sure
exactly
how
lucy
felt
the
pretenderette
was
led
away
and
now
caesar
stood
facing
the
children
his
hands
held
out
in
farewell
the
growing
light
of
early
morning
transfigured
his
face
and
to
philip
it
suddenly
seemed
to
be
most
remarkably
like
the
face
of
that
man
peter
graham
whom
helen
had
married
he
was
just
telling
himself
not
to
be
a
duffer
when
lucy
cried
out
in
a
loud
voice
oh
daddy
and
sprang
forward
and
at
that
moment
the
sun
rose
above
the
city
wall
and
its
rays
gleamed
redly
on
the
helmet
and
the
breastplate
and
the
shield
and
the
sword
of
caesar
the
light
struck
at
the
children
eyes
like
a
blow
dazzled
they
closed
their
eyes
and
when
they
opened
them
blinking
and
confused
caesar
was
gone
and
the
marble
book
was
closed
for
ever
three
days
later
noah
arrived
by
elephant
and
the
meeting
between
him
and
the
children
is
as
they
say
better
imagined
than
described
especially
as
there
is
not
much
time
left
now
for
describing
anything
noah
explained
that
the
freeing
of
polistopolis
from
the
pretenderette
and
the
barbarians
counted
as
the
seventh
deed
and
that
philip
had
now
attained
the
rank
of
king
the
deed
of
the
great
sloth
having
given
him
the
title
of
prince
of
his
expression
of
gratitude
and
admiration
were
of
the
warmest
and
philip
felt
that
it
was
rather
ungrateful
of
him
to
say
as
he
could
help
saying
i
done
all
the
deeds
may
i
go
back
to
helen
in
good
time
said
noah
will
at
once
set
about
the
arrangements
for
your
coronation
the
coronation
was
an
occasion
of
unexampled
splendour
there
was
a
banquet
of
course
and
fireworks
and
all
the
guns
fired
salutes
and
the
soldiers
presented
arms
and
the
ladies
presented
bouquets
and
at
the
end
noah
with
a
few
words
which
brought
tears
to
all
eyes
placed
the
gold
crown
of
polistarchia
upon
the
brow
of
philip
where
its
diamonds
and
rubies
shone
dazzlingly
there
was
an
extra
crown
for
lucy
made
of
silver
and
pearls
and
pale
silvery
moonstones
you
have
no
idea
how
the
polistarchians
shouted
now
said
noah
when
it
was
all
over
regret
to
inform
you
that
we
must
part
polistarchia
is
a
republic
and
of
course
in
a
republic
kings
and
queens
are
not
permitted
to
exist
partings
are
painful
things
and
you
had
better
go
at
once
he
was
plainly
very
much
upset
is
very
sudden
said
philip
and
lucy
said
do
think
it
silly
how
shall
we
get
home
all
in
a
hurry
like
this
did
you
get
here
building
a
house
and
getting
into
it
build
your
own
house
oh
we
have
models
of
all
the
houses
you
were
ever
in
the
pieces
are
all
numbered
you
only
have
to
put
them
together
he
led
them
to
a
large
room
behind
the
hall
of
public
amusements
and
took
down
from
a
shelf
a
stout
box
labelled
grange
on
another
box
philip
saw
cottage
noah
kneeling
on
his
yellow
mat
tumbled
the
contents
of
the
box
out
on
the
floor
and
philip
and
lucy
set
to
work
to
build
a
house
with
the
exquisitely
finished
little
blocks
and
stones
and
beams
and
windows
and
chimneys
can
not
bear
to
see
you
go
said
noah
remember
me
sometimes
shall
never
forget
you
said
the
children
jumping
up
hugging
him
said
the
parrot
who
had
followed
them
in
said
everybody
wish
the
was
not
lost
philip
even
at
this
parting
moment
remembered
to
say
is
said
noah
flew
back
to
the
island
directly
you
left
her
sails
are
called
wings
are
they
not
white
wings
that
never
grow
weary
you
know
relieved
of
your
weight
the
faithful
yacht
flew
home
like
any
pigeon
said
philip
could
bear
to
think
of
her
rotting
away
in
a
cavern
wish
max
and
brenda
had
come
to
say
said
lucy
is
not
needed
said
noah
mysteriously
and
then
everybody
said
again
and
noah
rolled
up
his
yellow
mat
put
it
under
his
arm
again
and
went
for
ever
the
children
built
the
grange
and
when
the
beautiful
little
model
of
that
house
was
there
before
them
perfect
they
stood
still
a
moment
looking
at
it
wish
we
could
be
two
people
each
said
lucy
one
of
each
of
us
go
home
and
one
of
each
of
us
stay
here
oh
she
cried
suddenly
and
snatched
at
philip
arm
for
a
slight
strange
giddiness
had
suddenly
caught
her
philip
too
swayed
a
little
uncertainly
and
stood
a
moment
with
his
hand
to
his
head
the
children
gazed
about
them
bewildered
and
still
a
little
giddy
the
room
was
gone
the
model
of
the
grange
was
gone
over
their
heads
was
blue
sky
under
their
feet
was
green
grass
and
in
front
stood
the
grange
itself
with
its
front
door
wide
open
and
on
the
steps
helen
and
peter
graham
that
telegram
had
brought
them
home
you
will
wonder
how
lucy
explained
where
she
had
been
when
she
was
lost
she
never
did
explain
there
are
some
things
as
you
know
that
can
not
be
explained
but
the
curious
thing
is
that
no
one
ever
asked
for
an
explanation
the
must
have
thought
they
knew
all
about
it
which
of
course
was
very
far
from
being
the
truth
when
the
four
people
on
the
doorstep
of
the
grange
had
finished
saying
how
glad
they
were
to
see
each
other
that
day
on
the
steps
when
philip
and
lucy
came
back
from
polistarchia
helen
and
peter
graham
came
back
from
belgium
helen
said
we
brought
you
each
the
loveliest
present
fetch
them
peter
there
a
dear
peter
graham
went
to
the
and
came
back
followed
by
two
long
tan
dachshunds
who
rushed
up
to
the
children
frisking
and
fawning
in
a
way
they
well
knew
max
why
brenda
cried
philip
helen
are
they
for
us
dear
of
course
they
are
said
helen
how
did
you
know
their
names
that
was
one
of
the
things
which
philip
could
not
tell
then
but
he
told
helen
the
whole
story
later
and
she
said
it
was
wonderful
and
how
clever
of
him
to
make
all
that
up
and
that
when
he
was
a
man
he
would
be
able
to
be
an
author
and
to
write
books
do
you
know
she
said
dream
about
the
island
quite
a
long
dream
only
when
i
woke
up
i
could
only
remember
that
i
been
there
and
seen
you
but
no
doubt
i
dreamed
about
noah
and
all
the
rest
of
it
as
well
only
i
forgot
it
and
max
and
brenda
of
course
loved
every
one
their
characters
were
quite
unchanged
only
the
children
had
forgotten
the
language
of
animals
so
that
conversation
between
them
and
the
dogs
was
for
ever
impossible
but
max
and
brenda
understand
every
word
you
say
any
one
can
see
that
you
want
to
know
what
became
of
the
redheaded
nurse
the
pretenderette
who
made
so
