several
days

and
just
the

good
cook
myself
turned
to
me
how
interesting
i
said
attempting
to
infuse
just
the
right
amount
of
enthusiasm
into
my
voice
oh

necessary
as
for

tucked
his
napkin
into
his
collar
and
blew
upon
his
soup

he

o
clock

make

but
not
much
four
slices
of
bread
two
eggs
two
slices
of
cold
ham
one
plate
of
soup
two
cups
of
is
nothing
to
he
asserted
the
fact
so
vehemently
that
i
had
not
the
courage
to
refute
it
all
eyes
were
suddenly
turned
upon
me
i
felt
i
was
bearing
the
burden
of
the
nation
s
preposterous
who
drank
a
cup
of
coffee
while
buttoning
my
blouse
in
the
morning
nothing
at
all
cried
herr
hoffmann
from
berlin
ach
when
i
was
in
england
in
the
morning
i
used
to
he
turned
up
his
eyes
and
his
moustache
wiping
the
soup
drippings
from
his
coat
and
waistcoat
do
they
really
eat
so
much
asked
fräulein
stiegelauer
soup
and
baker
s
bread
and
pig
s
flesh
and
tea
and
coffee
and
stewed
fruit
and
honey
and
eggs
and
cold
fish
and
kidneys
and
hot
fish
and
liver
all
the
ladies
eat
too
especially
the
certainly
i
myself
have
noticed
it
when
i
was
living
in
a
hotel
in
leicester
square
cried
the
herr
rat
it
was
a
good
hotel
but
they
could
not
make
ah
that
s
one
thing
i
can
do
said
i
laughing
brightly
i
can
make
very
good
tea
the
great
secret
is
to
warm
the
warm
the
teapot
interrupted
the
herr
rat
pushing
away
his
soup
plate
what
do
you
warm
the
teapot
for
ha
ha
that
s
very
good
one
does
not
eat
the
teapot
i
suppose
he
fixed
his
cold
blue
eyes
upon
me
with
an
expression
which
suggested
a
thousand
premeditated
invasions
so
that
is
the
great
secret
of
your
english
tea
all
you
do
is
to
warm
the
i
wanted
to
say
that
was
only
the
preliminary
canter
but
could
not
translate
it
and
so
was
silent
the
servant
brought
in
veal
with
sauerkraut
and
potatoes
i
eat
sauerkraut
with
great
pleasure
said
the
traveller
from
north
germany
but
now
i
have
eaten
so
much
of
it
that
i
can
not
retain
it
i
am
immediately
forced
a
beautiful
day
i
cried
turning
to
fräulein
stiegelauer
did
you
get
up
early
at
five
o
clock
i
walked
for
ten
minutes
in
the
wet
grass
again
in
bed
at
five
i
fell
asleep
and
woke
at
seven
when
i
made
an
overbody
washing
again
in
bed
at
eight
o
clock
i
had
a
poultice
and
at
half
past
eight
i
drank
a
cup
of
mint
tea
at
nine
i
drank
some
malt
coffee
and
began
my
pass
me
the
sauerkraut
please
you
do
not
eat
it
no
thank
you
i
still
find
it
a
little
is
it
true
asked
the
widow
picking
her
teeth
with
a
hairpin
as
she
spoke
that
you
are
a
vegetarian
why
yes
i
have
not
eaten
meat
for
three
have
you
any
family
there
now
you
see
that
s
what
you
re
coming
to
who
ever
heard
of
having
children
upon
vegetables
it
is
not
possible
but
you
never
have
large
families
in
england
now
i
suppose
you
are
too
busy
with
your
suffragetting
now
i
have
had
nine
children
and
they
are
all
alive
thank
god
fine
healthy
after
the
first
one
was
born
i
had
how
wonderful
i
cried
wonderful
said
the
widow
contemptuously
replacing
the
hairpin
in
the
knob
which
was
balanced
on
the
top
of
her
head
not
at
all
a
friend
of
mine
had
four
at
the
same
time
her
husband
was
so
pleased
he
gave
a
and
had
them
placed
on
the
table
of
course
she
was
very
germany
boomed
the
traveller
biting
round
a
potato
which
he
had
speared
with
his
knife
is
the
home
of
the
followed
an
appreciative
silence
the
dishes
were
changed
for
beef
red
currants
and
spinach
they
wiped
their
forks
upon
black
bread
and
started
again
how
long
are
you
remaining
here
asked
the
herr
rat
i
do
not
know
exactly
i
must
be
back
in
london
in
of
course
you
will
visit
münchen
i
am
afraid
i
shall
not
have
time
you
see
it
is
important
not
to
break
into
my
but
you
must
go
to
münchen
you
have
not
seen
germany
if
you
have
not
been
to
münchen
all
the
exhibitions
all
the
art
and
soul
life
of
germany
are
in
münchen
there
is
the
wagner
festival
in
august
and
mozart
and
a
japanese
collection
of
there
is
the
beer
you
do
not
know
what
good
beer
is
until
you
have
been
to
münchen
why
i
see
fine
ladies
every
afternoon
but
fine
ladies
i
tell
you
drinking
glasses
so
he
measured
a
good
washstand
pitcher
in
height
and
i
smiled
if
i
drink
a
great
deal
of
münchen
beer
i
sweat
so
said
herr
hoffmann
when
i
am
here
in
the
fields
or
before
my
baths
i
sweat
but
i
enjoy
it
but
in
the
town
it
is
not
at
all
the
same
prompted
by
the
thought
he
wiped
his
neck
and
face
with
his
dinner
napkin
and
carefully
cleaned
his
ears
a
glass
dish
of
stewed
apricots
was
placed
upon
the
table
ah
fruit
said
fräulein
stiegelauer
that
is
so
necessary
to
health
the
doctor
told
me
this
morning
that
the
more
fruit
i
could
eat
the
she
very
obviously
followed
the
advice
said
the
traveller
i
suppose
you
are
frightened
of
an
invasion
too
eh
oh
that
s
good
i
ve
been
reading
all
about
your
english
play
in
a
newspaper
did
you
see
it
i
sat
upright
i
assure
you
we
are
not
well
then
you
ought
to
be
said
the
herr
rat
you
have
got
no
army
at
few
little
boys
with
their
veins
full
of
nicotine
don
t
be
afraid
herr
hoffmann
said
we
don
t
want
england
if
we
did
we
would
have
had
her
long
ago
we
really
do
not
want
he
waved
his
spoon
airily
looking
across
at
me
as
though
i
were
a
little
child
whom
he
would
keep
or
dismiss
as
he
pleased
we
certainly
do
not
want
germany
i
said
this
morning
i
took
a
half
bath
then
this
afternoon
i
must
take
a
knee
bath
and
an
arm
bath
volunteered
the
herr
rat
then
i
do
my
exercises
for
an
hour
and
my
work
is
over
a
glass
of
wine
and
a
couple
of
rolls
with
some
they
were
handed
cherry
cake
with
whipped
cream
what
is
your
husband
s
favourite
meat
asked
the
widow
i
really
do
not
know
i
answered
you
really
do
not
know
how
long
have
you
been
married
three
but
you
can
not
be
in
earnest
you
would
not
have
kept
house
as
his
wife
for
a
week
without
knowing
that
i
really
never
asked
him
he
is
not
at
all
particular
about
his
a
pause
they
all
looked
at
me
shaking
their
heads
their
mouths
full
of
cherry
stones
no
wonder
there
is
a
repetition
in
england
of
that
dreadful
state
of
things
in
paris
said
the
widow
folding
her
dinner
napkin
how
can
a
woman
expect
to
keep
her
husband
if
she
does
not
know
his
favourite
food
after
three
years
mahlzeit
mahlzeit
i
closed
the
door
after
me
the
baron
who
is
he
i
said
and
why
does
he
sit
always
alone
with
his
back
to
us
too
ah
whispered
the
frau
oberregierungsrat
he
is
a
she
looked
at
me
very
solemnly
and
yet
with
the
slightest
possible
expression
but
poor
soul
he
can
not
help
it
i
said
surely
that
unfortunate
fact
ought
not
to
debar
him
from
the
pleasures
of
intellectual
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
fork
i
think
she
would
have
crossed
herself
surely
you
can
not
understand
he
is
one
of
the
first
more
than
a
little
unnerved
she
turned
and
spoke
to
the
frau
doktor
on
her
left
my
omelette
is
she
protested
and
this
is
the
third
i
have
tried
i
looked
at
the
first
of
the
barons
he
was
eating
a
whole
lettuce
leaf
on
his
fork
and
absorbing
it
slowly
fascinating
process
to
watch
small
and
slight
with
scanty
black
hair
and
beard
and
complexion
he
invariably
wore
black
serge
clothes
a
rough
linen
shirt
black
sandals
and
the
largest
spectacles
that
i
had
ever
seen
the
herr
oberlehrer
who
sat
opposite
me
smiled
benignantly
it
must
be
very
interesting
for
you
gnädige
frau
to
be
able
to
watch
of
course
this
is
a
very
fine
house
there
was
a
lady
from
the
spanish
court
here
in
the
summer
she
had
a
liver
we
often
spoke
i
looked
gratified
and
humble
now
in
england
in
your
boarding
ouse
one
does
not
find
the
first
class
as
in
no
indeed
i
replied
still
hypnotised
by
the
baron
who
looked
like
a
little
yellow
silkworm
the
baron
comes
every
year
went
on
the
herr
oberlehrer
for
his
nerves
he
has
never
spoken
to
any
of
the
a
smile
crossed
his
face
i
seemed
to
see
his
visions
of
some
splendid
upheaval
of
that
dazzling
exchange
of
courtesies
in
a
dim
future
a
splendid
sacrifice
of
a
newspaper
to
this
exalted
one
a
danke
schön
to
be
handed
down
to
future
generations
at
that
moment
the
postman
looking
like
a
german
army
officer
came
in
with
the
mail
he
threw
my
letters
into
my
milk
pudding
and
then
turned
to
a
waitress
and
whispered
she
retired
hastily
the
manager
of
the
pension
came
in
with
a
little
tray
a
picture
post
card
was
deposited
on
it
and
reverently
bowing
his
head
the
manager
of
the
pension
carried
it
to
the
baron
myself
i
felt
disappointed
that
there
was
not
a
salute
of
guns
at
the
end
of
the
meal
we
were
served
with
coffee
i
noticed
the
baron
took
three
lumps
of
sugar
putting
two
in
his
cup
and
wrapping
up
the
third
in
a
corner
of
his
he
was
always
the
first
to
enter
the
and
the
last
to
leave
and
in
a
vacant
chair
beside
him
he
placed
a
little
black
leather
bag
in
the
afternoon
leaning
from
my
window
i
saw
him
pass
down
the
street
walking
tremulously
and
carrying
the
bag
each
time
he
passed
a
he
shrank
a
little
as
though
expecting
it
to
strike
him
or
maybe
the
sense
of
plebeian
contamination
i
wondered
where
he
was
going
and
why
he
carried
the
bag
never
had
i
seen
him
at
the
casino
or
the
bath
establishment
he
looked
forlorn
his
feet
slipped
in
his
sandals
i
found
myself
pitying
the
baron
that
evening
a
party
of
us
were
gathered
in
the
salon
discussing
the
day
s
kur
with
feverish
animation
the
frau
oberregierungsrat
sat
by
me
knitting
a
shawl
for
her
youngest
of
nine
daughters
who
was
in
that
very
interesting
frail
condition
but
it
is
bound
to
be
quite
satisfactory
she
said
to
me
the
dear
married
a
desire
of
her
there
must
have
been
eight
or
ten
of
us
gathered
together
we
who
were
married
exchanging
confidences
as
to
the
underclothing
and
peculiar
characteristics
of
our
husbands
the
unmarried
discussing
the
and
peculiar
fascinations
of
possible
ones
i
knit
them
myself
i
heard
the
frau
lehrer
cry
of
thick
grey
wool
he
wears
one
a
month
with
two
soft
and
then
whispered
fräulein
lisa
he
said
to
me
indeed
you
please
me
i
shall
perhaps
write
to
your
small
wonder
that
we
were
a
little
violently
excited
a
little
expostulatory
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
admitted
the
baron
followed
a
complete
and
deathlike
silence
he
came
in
slowly
hesitated
took
up
a
toothpick
from
a
dish
on
the
top
of
the
piano
and
went
out
again
when
the
door
was
closed
we
raised
a
triumphant
cry
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
been
known
to
enter
the
salon
who
could
tell
what
the
future
held
days
lengthened
into
weeks
still
we
were
together
and
still
the
solitary
little
figure
head
bowed
as
though
under
the
weight
of
the
spectacles
haunted
me
he
entered
with
the
black
bag
he
retired
with
the
black
that
was
all
at
last
the
manager
of
the
pension
told
us
the
baron
was
leaving
the
next
day
oh
i
thought
surely
he
can
not
drift
into
lost
without
one
word
surely
he
will
honour
the
frau
oberregierungsrat
or
the
frau
feldleutnantswitwe
once
before
he
in
the
evening
of
that
day
it
rained
heavily
i
went
to
the
post
office
and
as
i
stood
on
the
steps
umbrellaless
hesitating
before
plunging
into
the
slushy
road
a
little
hesitating
voice
seemed
to
come
from
under
my
elbow
i
looked
down
it
was
the
first
of
the
barons
with
the
black
bag
and
an
umbrella
was
i
mad
was
i
sane
he
was
asking
me
to
share
the
latter
but
i
was
exceedingly
nice
a
trifle
diffident
appropriately
reverential
together
we
walked
through
the
mud
and
slush
now
there
is
something
peculiarly
intimate
in
sharing
an
umbrella
it
is
apt
to
put
one
on
the
same
footing
as
brushing
a
man
s
coat
for
little
daring
naïve
i
longed
to
know
why
he
sat
alone
why
he
carried
the
bag
what
he
did
all
day
but
he
himself
volunteered
some
information
i
fear
he
said
that
my
luggage
will
be
damp
i
invariably
carry
it
with
me
in
this
requires
so
servants
are
a
wise
idea
i
answered
and
then
why
have
you
denied
us
the
i
sit
alone
that
i
may
eat
more
said
the
baron
peering
into
the
dusk
my
stomach
requires
a
great
deal
of
food
i
order
double
portions
and
eat
them
in
which
sounded
finely
baronial
and
what
do
you
do
all
day
i
imbibe
nourishment
in
my
room
he
replied
in
a
voice
that
closed
the
conversation
and
almost
repented
of
the
umbrella
when
we
arrived
at
the
pension
there
was
very
nearly
an
open
riot
i
ran
half
way
up
the
stairs
and
thanked
the
baron
audibly
from
the
landing
he
distinctly
replied
not
at
all
it
was
very
friendly
of
the
herr
oberlehrer
to
have
sent
me
a
bouquet
that
evening
and
the
frau
oberregierungsrat
asked
me
for
my
pattern
of
a
baby
s
bonnet
next
day
the
baron
was
gone
sic
transit
gloria
german
mundi
the
sister
of
the
baroness
there
are
two
new
guests
arriving
this
afternoon
said
the
manager
of
the
pension
placing
a
chair
for
me
at
the
i
have
only
received
the
letter
acquainting
me
with
the
fact
this
morning
the
baroness
von
gall
is
sending
her
little
poor
child
is
make
the
she
is
to
stay
with
us
a
month
and
then
the
baroness
herself
is
baroness
von
gall
cried
the
frau
doktor
coming
into
the
room
and
positively
scenting
the
name
coming
here
there
was
a
picture
of
her
only
last
week
in
sport
and
salon
she
is
a
friend
of
the
court
i
have
heard
that
the
kaiserin
says
du
to
her
but
this
is
delightful
i
shall
take
my
doctor
s
advice
and
spend
an
extra
six
weeks
here
there
is
nothing
like
young
but
the
child
is
dumb
ventured
the
manager
apologetically
bah
what
does
that
matter
afflicted
children
have
such
pretty
each
guest
who
came
into
the
was
bombarded
with
the
wonderful
news
the
baroness
von
gall
is
sending
her
little
daughter
here
the
baroness
herself
is
coming
in
a
month
s
coffee
and
rolls
took
on
the
nature
of
an
orgy
we
positively
scintillated
anecdotes
of
the
high
born
were
poured
out
sweetened
and
sipped
we
gorged
on
scandals
of
high
birth
generously
buttered
they
are
to
have
the
room
next
to
yours
said
the
manager
addressing
me
i
was
wondering
if
you
would
permit
me
to
take
down
the
portrait
of
the
kaiserin
elizabeth
from
above
your
bed
to
hang
over
their
yes
indeed
something
homelike
frau
oberregierungsrat
patted
my
and
of
no
possible
significance
to
i
felt
a
little
crushed
not
at
the
prospect
of
losing
that
vision
of
diamonds
and
blue
velvet
bust
but
at
the
me
outside
the
me
as
a
foreigner
we
dissipated
the
day
in
valid
speculations
decided
it
was
too
warm
to
walk
in
the
afternoon
so
lay
down
on
our
beds
mustering
in
great
force
for
afternoon
coffee
and
a
carriage
drew
up
at
the
door
a
tall
young
girl
got
out
leading
a
child
by
the
hand
they
entered
the
hall
were
greeted
and
shown
to
their
room
ten
minutes
later
she
came
down
with
the
child
to
sign
the
visitors
book
she
wore
a
black
closely
fitting
dress
touched
at
throat
and
wrists
with
white
frilling
her
brown
hair
braided
was
tied
with
a
black
pale
with
a
small
mole
on
her
left
cheek
i
am
the
baroness
von
gall
s
sister
she
said
trying
the
pen
on
a
piece
of
and
smiling
at
us
deprecatingly
even
for
the
most
jaded
of
us
life
holds
its
thrilling
moments
two
baronesses
in
two
months
the
manager
immediately
left
the
room
to
find
a
new
nib
to
my
plebeian
eyes
that
afflicted
child
was
singularly
unattractive
she
had
the
air
of
having
been
perpetually
washed
with
a
blue
bag
and
hair
like
grey
too
in
a
pinafore
so
stiffly
starched
that
she
could
only
peer
at
us
over
the
frill
of
social
barrier
of
a
perhaps
it
was
too
much
to
expect
a
noble
aunt
to
attend
to
the
menial
consideration
of
her
niece
s
ears
but
a
dumb
niece
with
unwashed
ears
struck
me
as
a
most
depressing
object
they
were
given
places
at
the
head
of
the
table
for
a
moment
we
all
looked
at
one
another
with
an
expression
then
the
frau
oberregierungsrat
i
hope
you
are
not
tired
after
your
no
said
the
sister
of
the
baroness
smiling
into
her
cup
i
hope
the
dear
child
is
not
tired
said
the
frau
doktor
not
at
i
expect
i
hope
you
will
sleep
well
the
herr
oberlehrer
said
reverently
the
poet
from
munich
never
took
his
eyes
off
the
pair
he
allowed
his
tie
to
absorb
most
of
his
coffee
while
he
gazed
at
them
exceedingly
soulfully
unyoking
pegasus
thought
i
death
spasms
of
his
odes
to
solitude
there
were
possibilities
in
that
young
woman
for
an
inspiration
not
to
mention
a
dedication
and
from
that
moment
his
suffering
temperament
took
up
its
bed
and
walked
they
retired
after
the
meal
leaving
us
to
discuss
them
at
leisure
there
is
a
likeness
mused
the
frau
doktor
quite
what
a
manner
she
has
such
reserve
such
a
tender
way
with
the
pity
she
has
the
child
to
attend
to
exclaimed
the
student
from
bonn
he
had
hitherto
relied
upon
three
scars
and
a
ribbon
to
produce
an
effect
but
the
sister
of
a
baroness
demanded
more
than
these
absorbing
days
followed
had
she
been
one
whit
less
beautifully
born
we
could
not
have
endured
the
continual
conversation
about
her
the
songs
in
her
praise
the
detailed
account
of
her
movements
but
she
graciously
suffered
our
worship
and
we
were
more
than
content
the
poet
she
took
into
her
confidence
he
carried
her
books
when
we
went
walking
he
jumped
the
afflicted
one
on
his
licence
one
morning
brought
his
notebook
into
the
salon
and
read
to
us
the
sister
of
the
baroness
has
assured
me
she
is
going
into
a
convent
he
said
that
made
the
student
from
bonn
sit
up
i
have
written
these
few
lines
last
night
from
my
window
in
the
sweet
night
oh
your
delicate
chest
commented
the
frau
doktor
he
fixed
a
stony
eye
on
her
and
she
blushed
i
have
written
these
lines
ah
will
you
to
a
convent
fly
so
young
so
fresh
so
fair
spring
like
a
doe
upon
the
fields
and
find
your
beauty
nine
verses
equally
lovely
commanded
her
to
equally
violent
action
i
am
certain
that
had
she
followed
his
advice
not
even
the
remainder
of
her
life
in
a
convent
would
have
given
her
time
to
recover
her
breath
i
have
presented
her
with
a
copy
he
said
and
we
are
going
to
look
for
wild
flowers
in
the
the
student
from
bonn
got
up
and
left
the
room
i
begged
the
poet
to
repeat
the
verses
once
more
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
verse
i
saw
from
the
window
the
sister
of
the
baroness
and
the
scarred
youth
disappearing
through
the
front
gate
which
enabled
me
to
thank
the
poet
so
charmingly
that
he
offered
to
write
me
out
a
copy
but
we
were
living
at
too
high
pressure
in
those
days
swinging
from
our
humble
pension
to
the
high
walls
of
palaces
how
could
we
help
but
fall
late
one
afternoon
the
frau
doktor
came
upon
me
in
the
and
took
me
to
her
bosom
she
has
been
telling
me
all
about
her
life
whispered
the
frau
doktor
she
came
to
my
bedroom
and
offered
to
massage
my
arm
you
know
i
am
the
greatest
martyr
to
rheumatism
and
fancy
now
she
has
already
had
six
proposals
of
marriage
such
beautiful
offers
that
i
assure
you
i
every
one
of
noble
birth
my
dear
the
most
beautiful
was
in
the
wood
not
that
i
do
not
think
a
proposal
should
take
place
in
a
is
more
fitting
to
have
four
this
was
a
private
wood
he
said
the
young
officer
she
was
like
a
young
tree
whose
branches
had
never
been
touched
by
the
ruthless
hand
of
man
such
delicacy
she
sighed
and
turned
up
her
eyes
of
course
it
is
difficult
for
you
english
to
understand
when
you
are
always
exposing
your
legs
on
and
breeding
dogs
in
your
back
gardens
the
pity
of
it
youth
should
be
like
a
wild
rose
for
myself
i
do
not
understand
how
your
women
ever
get
married
at
she
shook
her
head
so
violently
that
i
shook
mine
too
and
a
gloom
settled
round
my
heart
it
seemed
we
were
really
in
a
very
bad
way
did
the
spirit
of
romance
spread
her
rose
wings
only
over
aristocratic
germany
i
went
to
my
room
bound
a
pink
scarf
about
my
hair
and
took
a
volume
of
mörike
s
lyrics
into
the
garden
a
great
bush
of
purple
lilac
grew
behind
the
there
i
sat
down
finding
a
sad
significance
in
the
delicate
suggestion
of
half
mourning
i
began
to
write
a
poem
myself
they
sway
and
languish
dreamily
and
we
close
pressed
are
kissing
it
ended
close
pressed
did
not
sound
at
all
fascinating
savoured
of
wardrobes
did
my
wild
rose
then
already
trail
in
the
dust
i
chewed
a
leaf
and
hugged
my
knees
heard
voices
from
the
the
sister
of
the
baroness
and
the
student
from
bonn
was
better
than
nothing
i
pricked
up
my
ears
what
small
hands
you
have
said
the
student
from
bonn
they
are
like
white
lilies
lying
in
the
pool
of
your
black
this
certainly
sounded
the
real
thing
her
reply
was
what
interested
me
sympathetic
murmur
only
may
i
hold
one
i
heard
two
they
had
rifled
those
dark
waters
of
a
noble
blossom
look
at
my
great
fingers
beside
but
they
are
beautifully
kept
said
the
sister
of
the
baroness
shyly
the
minx
was
love
then
a
question
of
manicure
how
i
should
adore
to
kiss
you
murmured
the
student
but
you
know
i
am
suffering
from
severe
nasal
catarrh
and
i
dare
not
risk
giving
it
to
you
sixteen
times
last
night
did
i
count
myself
sneezing
and
three
different
i
threw
mörike
into
the
lilac
bush
and
went
back
to
the
house
a
great
automobile
snorted
at
the
front
door
in
the
salon
great
commotion
the
baroness
was
paying
a
surprise
visit
to
her
little
daughter
clad
in
a
yellow
mackintosh
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
questioning
the
manager
and
every
guest
the
pension
contained
was
grouped
about
her
even
the
frau
doktor
presumably
examining
a
timetable
as
near
to
the
august
skirts
as
possible
but
where
is
my
maid
asked
the
baroness
there
was
no
maid
replied
the
manager
save
for
your
gracious
sister
and
sister
she
cried
sharply
fool
i
have
no
sister
my
child
travelled
with
the
daughter
of
my
tableau
grandissimo
frau
fischer
frau
fischer
was
the
fortunate
possessor
of
a
candle
factory
somewhere
on
the
banks
of
the
eger
and
once
a
year
she
ceased
from
her
labours
to
make
a
cure
in
dorschausen
arriving
with
a
neatly
covered
in
a
black
tarpaulin
and
a
the
latter
contained
amongst
her
handkerchiefs
eau
de
cologne
toothpicks
and
a
certain
woollen
muffler
very
comforting
to
the
magen
samples
of
her
skill
in
to
be
offered
up
as
tokens
of
thanksgiving
when
her
holiday
time
was
over
four
of
the
clock
one
july
afternoon
she
appeared
at
the
pension
müller
i
was
sitting
in
the
arbour
and
watched
her
bustling
up
the
path
followed
by
the
porter
with
her
in
his
arms
and
a
sunflower
between
his
teeth
the
widow
and
her
five
innocent
daughters
stood
tastefully
grouped
upon
the
steps
in
appropriate
attitudes
of
welcome
and
the
greetings
were
so
long
and
loud
that
i
felt
a
sympathetic
glow
what
a
journey
cried
the
frau
fischer
and
nothing
to
eat
in
the
solid
i
assure
you
the
sides
of
my
stomach
are
flapping
together
but
i
must
not
spoil
my
appetite
for
a
cup
of
coffee
in
my
room
bertha
turning
to
the
youngest
of
the
five
how
changed
what
a
bust
frau
hartmann
i
congratulate
once
again
the
widow
seized
frau
fischer
s
hands
kathi
too
a
splendid
woman
but
a
little
pale
perhaps
the
young
man
from
nürnberg
is
here
again
this
year
how
you
keep
them
all
i
don
t
know
each
year
i
come
expecting
to
find
you
with
an
empty
nest
it
s
frau
hartmann
in
an
ashamed
apologetic
voice
we
are
such
a
happy
family
since
my
dear
man
but
these
must
have
courage
and
after
all
give
them
time
they
all
make
the
happy
family
god
for
that
are
there
many
people
here
just
now
every
room
followed
a
detailed
description
in
the
hall
murmured
on
the
stairs
continued
in
six
parts
as
they
entered
the
large
room
windows
opening
upon
the
garden
which
frau
fischer
occupied
each
successive
year
i
was
reading
the
miracles
of
lourdes
which
a
catholic
a
gloomy
eye
upon
my
begged
me
to
digest
but
its
wonders
were
completely
routed
by
frau
fischer
s
arrival
not
even
the
white
roses
upon
the
feet
of
the
virgin
could
flourish
in
that
atmosphere
it
was
a
simple
who
pastured
her
flocks
upon
the
barren
fields
voices
from
the
room
above
the
washstand
has
of
course
been
scrubbed
over
with
her
limbs
with
tattered
rags
half
covered
every
stick
of
the
furniture
has
been
sunning
in
the
garden
for
three
days
and
the
carpet
we
made
ourselves
out
of
old
clothes
there
is
a
piece
of
that
beautiful
flannel
petticoat
you
left
us
last
deaf
and
dumb
was
the
child
in
fact
the
population
considered
her
half
idiot
yes
that
is
a
new
picture
of
the
kaiser
we
have
moved
the
one
of
jesus
christ
out
into
the
passage
it
was
not
cheerful
to
sleep
with
dear
frau
fischer
won
t
you
take
your
coffee
out
in
the
garden
that
is
a
very
nice
idea
but
first
i
must
remove
my
corsets
and
my
boots
ah
what
a
relief
to
wear
sandals
again
i
am
needing
the
cure
very
badly
this
year
my
nerves
i
am
a
mass
of
them
during
the
entire
journey
i
sat
with
my
handkerchief
over
my
head
even
while
the
guard
collected
the
tickets
exhausted
she
came
into
the
arbour
wearing
a
black
and
white
spotted
and
a
calico
cap
peaked
with
patent
leather
followed
by
kathi
carrying
the
little
blue
jugs
of
malt
coffee
we
were
formally
introduced
frau
fischer
sat
down
produced
a
perfectly
clean
pocket
handkerchief
and
polished
her
cup
and
saucer
then
lifted
the
lid
of
the
and
peered
in
at
the
contents
mournfully
malt
coffee
she
said
ah
for
the
first
few
days
i
wonder
how
i
can
put
up
with
it
naturally
absent
from
home
one
must
expect
much
discomfort
and
strange
food
but
as
i
used
to
say
to
my
dear
husband
with
a
clean
sheet
and
a
good
cup
of
coffee
i
can
find
my
happiness
anywhere
but
now
with
nerves
like
mine
no
sacrifice
is
too
terrible
for
me
to
make
what
complaint
are
you
suffering
from
you
look
exceedingly
healthy
i
smiled
and
shrugged
my
shoulders
ah
that
is
so
strange
about
you
english
you
do
not
seem
to
enjoy
discussing
the
functions
of
the
body
as
well
speak
of
a
railway
train
and
refuse
to
mention
the
engine
how
can
we
hope
to
understand
anybody
knowing
nothing
of
their
stomachs
in
my
husband
s
most
severe
she
dipped
a
piece
of
sugar
in
her
coffee
and
watched
it
dissolve
yet
a
young
friend
of
mine
who
travelled
to
england
for
the
funeral
of
his
brother
told
me
that
women
wore
bodices
in
public
restaurants
no
waiter
could
help
looking
into
as
he
handed
the
but
only
german
waiters
i
said
english
ones
look
over
the
top
of
your
there
she
cried
now
you
see
your
dependence
on
germany
not
even
an
efficient
waiter
can
you
have
by
but
i
prefer
them
to
look
over
your
and
that
proves
that
you
must
be
ashamed
of
your
i
looked
out
over
the
garden
full
of
and
standard
growing
stiffly
like
german
bouquets
feeling
i
did
not
care
one
way
or
the
other
i
rather
wanted
to
ask
her
if
the
young
friend
had
gone
to
england
in
the
capacity
of
waiter
to
attend
the
funeral
baked
meats
but
decided
it
was
not
worth
it
the
weather
was
too
hot
to
be
malicious
and
who
could
be
uncharitable
victimised
by
the
flapping
sensations
which
frau
fischer
was
enduring
until
as
a
gift
from
heaven
for
my
forbearance
down
the
path
towards
us
came
the
herr
rat
angelically
clad
in
a
white
silk
suit
he
and
frau
fischer
were
old
friends
she
drew
the
folds
of
her
together
and
made
room
for
him
on
the
little
green
bench
how
cool
you
are
looking
she
said
and
if
i
may
make
the
a
beautiful
suit
surely
i
wore
it
last
summer
when
you
were
here
i
brought
the
silk
from
it
through
the
russian
customs
by
swathing
it
round
my
body
and
such
a
quantity
two
dress
lengths
for
my
three
suits
for
myself
a
cloak
for
the
housekeeper
of
my
flat
in
munich
how
i
perspired
every
inch
of
it
had
to
be
washed
surely
you
have
had
more
adventures
than
any
man
in
germany
when
i
think
of
the
time
that
you
spent
in
turkey
with
a
drunken
guide
who
was
bitten
by
a
mad
dog
and
fell
over
a
precipice
into
a
field
of
attar
of
roses
i
lament
that
you
have
not
written
a
i
am
getting
a
few
notes
together
and
now
that
you
are
here
we
shall
renew
our
quiet
little
talks
after
supper
yes
it
is
necessary
and
pleasant
for
a
man
to
find
relaxation
in
the
company
of
women
indeed
i
realise
that
even
here
your
life
is
too
are
so
sought
admired
it
was
just
the
same
with
my
dear
husband
he
was
a
tall
beautiful
man
and
sometimes
in
the
evening
he
would
come
down
into
the
kitchen
and
say
wife
i
would
like
to
be
stupid
for
two
nothing
rested
him
so
much
then
as
for
me
to
stroke
his
the
herr
rat
s
bald
pate
glistening
in
the
sunlight
seemed
symbolical
of
the
sad
absence
of
a
wife
i
began
to
wonder
as
to
the
nature
of
these
quiet
little
talks
how
could
one
play
delilah
to
so
shorn
a
samson
herr
hoffmann
from
berlin
arrived
yesterday
said
the
herr
rat
that
young
man
i
refuse
to
converse
with
he
told
me
last
year
that
he
had
stayed
in
france
in
an
hotel
where
they
did
not
have
serviettes
what
a
place
it
must
have
been
in
austria
even
the
cabmen
have
serviettes
also
i
have
heard
that
he
discussed
free
love
with
bertha
as
she
was
sweeping
his
room
i
am
not
accustomed
to
such
company
i
had
suspected
him
for
a
long
young
blood
answered
the
herr
rat
genially
i
have
had
several
disputes
with
have
heard
it
not
so
turning
to
me
a
great
many
i
said
smiling
doubtless
you
too
consider
me
behind
the
times
i
make
no
secret
of
my
age
i
am
but
you
must
have
surely
observed
how
impossible
it
was
for
him
to
speak
at
all
when
i
raised
my
i
replied
with
the
utmost
conviction
and
catching
frau
fischer
s
eye
suddenly
realised
i
had
better
go
back
to
the
house
and
write
some
letters
it
was
dark
and
cool
in
my
room
a
pushed
green
boughs
against
the
window
i
looked
down
at
the
horsehair
sofa
so
openly
flouting
the
idea
of
curling
up
as
immoral
pulled
the
red
pillow
on
to
the
floor
and
lay
down
and
barely
had
i
got
comfortable
when
the
door
opened
and
frau
fischer
entered
the
herr
rat
had
a
bathing
appointment
she
said
shutting
the
door
after
her
may
i
come
in
pray
do
not
move
you
look
like
a
little
persian
kitten
now
tell
me
something
really
interesting
about
your
life
when
i
meet
new
people
i
squeeze
them
dry
like
a
sponge
to
begin
are
i
admit
the
fact
then
dear
child
where
is
your
husband
i
said
he
was
a
on
a
long
and
perilous
voyage
what
a
position
to
leave
you
young
and
so
she
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
shook
her
finger
at
me
playfully
admit
now
that
you
keep
your
journeys
secret
from
him
for
what
man
would
think
of
allowing
a
woman
with
such
a
wealth
of
hair
to
go
wandering
in
foreign
countries
now
supposing
that
you
lost
your
purse
at
midnight
in
a
snowbound
train
in
north
russia
but
i
haven
t
the
slightest
i
began
i
don
t
say
that
you
have
but
when
you
said
to
your
dear
man
i
am
positive
that
you
had
no
intention
of
coming
here
my
dear
i
am
a
woman
of
experience
and
i
know
the
world
while
he
is
away
you
have
a
fever
in
your
blood
your
sad
heart
flies
for
comfort
to
these
foreign
lands
at
home
you
can
not
bear
the
sight
of
that
empty
is
like
widowhood
since
the
death
of
my
dear
husband
i
have
never
known
an
hour
s
i
like
empty
beds
i
protested
sleepily
thumping
the
pillow
that
can
not
be
true
because
it
is
not
natural
every
wife
ought
to
feel
that
her
place
is
by
her
husband
s
or
waking
it
is
plain
to
see
that
the
strongest
tie
of
all
does
not
yet
bind
you
wait
until
a
little
pair
of
hands
stretches
across
the
until
he
comes
into
harbour
and
sees
you
with
the
child
at
your
i
sat
up
stiffly
but
i
consider
the
most
ignominious
of
all
professions
i
said
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
then
frau
fischer
reached
down
and
caught
my
hand
so
young
and
yet
to
suffer
so
cruelly
she
murmured
there
is
nothing
that
sours
a
woman
so
terribly
as
to
be
left
alone
without
a
man
especially
if
she
is
married
for
then
it
is
impossible
for
her
to
accept
the
attention
of
she
is
unfortunately
a
widow
of
course
i
know
that
are
subject
to
terrible
temptations
and
they
are
as
inflammable
as
tenor
is
why
you
must
present
a
bright
and
energetic
appearance
and
try
and
make
him
proud
of
you
when
his
ship
reaches
this
husband
that
i
had
created
for
the
benefit
of
frau
fischer
became
in
her
hands
so
substantial
a
figure
that
i
could
no
longer
see
myself
sitting
on
a
rock
with
seaweed
in
my
hair
awaiting
that
phantom
ship
for
which
all
women
love
to
suppose
they
hunger
rather
i
saw
myself
pushing
a
perambulator
up
the
gangway
and
counting
up
the
missing
buttons
on
my
husband
s
uniform
jacket
handfuls
of
babies
that
is
what
you
are
really
in
need
of
mused
frau
fischer
then
as
the
father
of
a
family
he
can
not
leave
you
think
of
his
delight
and
excitement
when
he
saw
you
the
plan
seemed
to
me
something
of
a
risk
to
appear
suddenly
with
handfuls
of
strange
babies
is
not
generally
calculated
to
raise
enthusiasm
in
the
heart
of
the
average
british
husband
i
decided
to
wreck
my
virgin
conception
and
send
him
down
somewhere
off
cape
horn
then
the
sounded
come
up
to
my
room
afterwards
said
frau
fischer
there
is
still
much
that
i
must
ask
she
squeezed
my
hand
but
i
did
not
squeeze
back
frau
brechenmacher
attends
a
wedding
getting
ready
was
a
terrible
business
after
supper
frau
brechenmacher
packed
four
of
the
five
babies
to
bed
allowing
rosa
to
stay
with
her
and
help
to
polish
the
buttons
of
herr
brechenmacher
s
uniform
then
she
ran
over
his
best
shirt
with
a
hot
iron
polished
his
boots
and
put
a
stitch
or
two
into
his
black
satin
necktie
rosa
she
said
fetch
my
dress
and
hang
it
in
front
of
the
stove
to
get
the
creases
out
now
mind
you
must
look
after
the
children
and
not
sit
up
later
than
eight
and
not
touch
the
know
what
will
happen
if
you
yes
mamma
said
rosa
who
was
nine
and
felt
old
enough
to
manage
a
thousand
lamps
but

me
stay
bub

and
want
some
eight
said
the
frau
i
ll

down
the
corners
of
her
mouth

into
the
bedroom
and

my
blue
silk
handkerchief

wear
my
black
shawl
while
i
m
now
rosa
dragged
it
off
her
mother
s
shoulders
and
wound
it
carefully
round
her
own
tying
the
two
ends
in
a
knot
at
the
back
after
all
she
reflected
if
she
had
to
go
to
bed
at
half
past
eight
she
would
keep
the
shawl
on
which
resolution
comforted
her
absolutely
now
then
where

my
clothes
cried
herr
brechenmacher
hanging
his
empty
behind
the
door
and
stamping
the
snow
out
of
his
boots
nothing

of
course

nothing
to
frau
brechenmacher
she
hooked
her
skirt
and
bodice
fastened
her
handkerchief
round
her
neck
with
a
beautiful
brooch
that
had
four
medals
to
the
virgin
dangling
from
it
and
then
drew
on
her
cloak
and
hood
here
come
and
fasten
this
buckle
called
herr
brechenmacher
he
stood
in
the
kitchen
puffing
himself
out
the
buttons
on
his
blue
uniform
shining
with
an
enthusiasm
which
nothing
but
official
buttons
could
possibly
possess
how
do
i
look
wonderful
replied
the
little
frau
straining
at
the
waist
buckle
and
giving
him
a
little
pull
here
a
little
tug
there
rosa
come
and
look
at
your
herr
brechenmacher
strode
up
and
down
the
kitchen
was
helped
on
with
his
coat
then
waited
while
the
frau
lighted
the
lantern
now
at
last
come
the
lamp
rosa
warned
the
frau
slamming
the
front
door
behind
them
snow
had
not
fallen
all
day
the
frozen
ground
was
slippery
as
an
icepond
she
had
not
been
out
of
the
house
for
weeks
past
and
the
day
had
so
flurried
her
that
she
felt
muddled
and
that
rosa
had
pushed
her
out
of
the
house
and
her
man
was
running
away
from
her
wait
wait
she
cried
no
i
ll
get
my
feet
it
was
easier
when
they
came
into
the
village
there
were
fences
to
cling
to
and
leading
from
the
railway
station
to
the
gasthaus
a
little
path
of
cinders
had
been
strewn
for
the
benefit
of
the
wedding
guests
the
gasthaus
was
very
festive
lights
shone
out
from
every
window
wreaths
of
fir
twigs
hung
from
the
ledges
branches
decorated
the
front
doors
which
swung
open
and
in
the
hall
the
landlord
voiced
his
superiority
by
bullying
the
waitresses
who
ran
about
continually
with
glasses
of
beer
trays
of
cups
and
saucers
and
bottles
of
wine
up
the
the
stairs
boomed
the
landlord
leave
your
coats
on
the
herr
brechenmacher
completely
overawed
by
this
grand
manner
so
far
forgot
his
rights
as
a
husband
as
to
beg
his
wife
s
pardon
for
jostling
her
against
the
banisters
in
his
efforts
to
get
ahead
of
everybody
else
herr
brechenmacher
s
colleagues
greeted
him
with
acclamation
as
he
entered
the
door
of
the
festsaal
and
the
frau
straightened
her
brooch
and
folded
her
hands
assuming
the
air
of
dignity
becoming
to
the
wife
of
a
postman
and
the
mother
of
five
children
beautiful
indeed
was
the
festsaal
three
long
tables
were
grouped
at
one
end
the
remainder
of
the
floor
space
cleared
for
dancing
oil
lamps
hanging
from
the
ceiling
shed
a
warm
bright
light
on
the
walls
decorated
with
paper
flowers
and
garlands
shed
a
warmer
brighter
light
on
the
red
faces
of
the
guests
in
their
best
clothes
at
the
head
of
the
centre
table
sat
the
bride
and
bridegroom
she
in
a
white
dress
trimmed
with
stripes
and
bows
of
coloured
ribbon
giving
her
the
appearance
of
an
iced
cake
all
ready
to
be
cut
and
served
in
neat
little
pieces
to
the
bridegroom
beside
her
who
wore
a
suit
of
white
clothes
much
too
large
for
him
and
a
white
silk
tie
that
rose
halfway
up
his
collar
grouped
about
them
with
a
fine
regard
for
dignity
and
precedence
sat
their
parents
and
relations
and
perched
on
a
stool
at
the
bride
s
right
hand
a
little
girl
in
a
crumpled
muslin
dress
with
a
wreath
of
hanging
over
one
ear
everybody
was
laughing
and
talking
shaking
hands
clinking
glasses
stamping
on
the
stench
of
beer
and
perspiration
filled
the
air
frau
brechenmacher
following
her
man
down
the
room
after
greeting
the
bridal
party
knew
that
she
was
going
to
enjoy
herself
she
seemed
to
fill
out
and
become
rosy
and
warm
as
she
sniffed
that
familiar
festive
smell
somebody
pulled
at
her
skirt
and
looking
down
she
saw
frau
rupp
the
butcher
s
wife
who
pulled
out
an
empty
chair
and
begged
her
to
sit
beside
her
fritz
will
get
you
some
beer
she
said
my
dear
your
skirt
is
open
at
the
back
we
could
not
help
laughing
as
you
walked
up
the
room
with
the
white
tape
of
your
petticoat
showing
but
how
frightful
said
frau
brechenmacher
collapsing
into
her
chair
and
biting
her
lip
na
it
s
over
now
said
frau
rupp
stretching
her
fat
hands
over
the
table
and
regarding
her
three
mourning
rings
with
intense
enjoyment
but
one
must
be
careful
especially
at
a
and
such
a
wedding
as
this
cried
frau
ledermann
who
sat
on
the
other
side
of
frau
brechenmacher
fancy
theresa
bringing
that
child
with
her
it
s
her
own
child
you
know
my
dear
and
it
s
going
to
live
with
them
that
s
what
i
call
a
sin
against
the
church
for
a
child
to
attend
its
own
mother
s
the
three
women
sat
and
stared
at
the
bride
who
remained
very
still
with
a
little
vacant
smile
on
her
lips
only
her
eyes
shifting
uneasily
from
side
to
side
beer
they
ve
given
it
too
whispered
frau
rupp
and
white
wine
and
an
ice
it
never
did
have
a
stomach
she
ought
to
have
left
it
at
frau
brechenmacher
turned
round
and
looked
towards
the
bride
s
mother
she
never
took
her
eyes
off
her
daughter
but
wrinkled
her
brown
forehead
like
an
old
monkey
and
nodded
now
and
again
very
solemnly
her
hands
shook
as
she
raised
her
beer
mug
and
when
she
had
drunk
she
spat
on
the
floor
and
savagely
wiped
her
mouth
with
her
sleeve
then
the
music
started
and
she
followed
theresa
with
her
eyes
looking
suspiciously
at
each
man
who
danced
with
her
cheer
up
old
woman
shouted
her
husband
digging
her
in
the
ribs
this
isn
t
theresa
s
he
winked
at
the
guests
who
broke
into
loud
laughter
i
am
cheerful
mumbled
the
old
woman
and
beat
upon
the
table
with
her
fist
keeping
time
to
the
music
proving
she
was
not
out
of
the
festivities
she
can
t
forget
how
wild
theresa
has
been
said
frau
ledermann
who
the
child
there
i
heard
that
last
sunday
evening
theresa
had
hysterics
and
said
that
she
would
not
marry
this
man
they
had
to
get
the
priest
to
where
is
the
other
one
asked
frau
brechenmacher
why
didn
t
he
marry
her
the
woman
shrugged
her
shoulders
he
was
a
traveller
and
only
stayed
at
their
house
two
nights
he
was
selling
shirt
bought
some
myself
and
they
were
beautiful
shirt
what
a
pig
of
a
fellow
i
can
t
think
what
he
saw
in
such
a
plain
you
never
know
her
mother
says
she
s
been
like
fire
ever
since
she
was
sixteen
frau
brechenmacher
looked
down
at
her
beer
and
blew
a
little
hole
in
the
froth
that
s
not
how
a
wedding
should
be
she
said
it
s
not
religion
to
love
two
nice
time
she
ll
have
with
this
one
frau
rupp
exclaimed
he
was
lodging
with
me
last
summer
and
i
had
to
get
rid
of
him
he
never
changed
his
clothes
once
in
two
months
and
when
i
spoke
to
him
of
the
smell
in
his
room
he
told
me
he
was
sure
it
floated
up
from
the
shop
ah
every
wife
has
her
cross
isn
t
that
true
my
dear
frau
brechenmacher
saw
her
husband
among
his
colleagues
at
the
next
table
he
was
drinking
far
too
much
she
wildly
the
saliva
spluttering
out
of
his
mouth
as
he
talked
yes
she
assented
that
s
true
girls
have
a
lot
to
wedged
in
between
these
two
fat
old
women
the
frau
had
no
hope
of
being
asked
to
dance
she
watched
the
couples
going
round
and
round
she
forgot
her
five
babies
and
her
man
and
felt
almost
like
a
girl
again
the
music
sounded
sad
and
sweet
her
roughened
hands
clasped
and
unclasped
themselves
in
the
folds
of
her
skirt
while
the
music
went
on
she
was
afraid
to
look
anybody
in
the
face
and
she
smiled
with
a
little
nervous
tremor
round
the
mouth
but
my
god
frau
rupp
cried
they
ve
given
that
child
of
theresa
s
a
piece
of
sausage
it
s
to
keep
her
quiet
there
s
going
to
be
a
presentation
man
has
to
frau
brechenmacher
sat
up
stiffly
the
music
ceased
and
the
dancers
took
their
places
again
at
the
tables
herr
brechenmacher
alone
remained
held
in
his
hands
a
big
silver
everybody
laughed
at
his
speech
except
the
frau
everybody
roared
at
his
grimaces
and
at
the
way
he
carried
the
to
the
bridal
pair
as
if
it
were
a
baby
he
was
holding
she
lifted
the
lid
peeped
in
then
shut
it
down
with
a
little
scream
and
sat
biting
her
lips
the
bridegroom
wrenched
the
pot
away
from
her
and
drew
forth
a
baby
s
bottle
and
two
little
cradles
holding
china
dolls
as
he
dandled
these
treasures
before
theresa
the
hot
room
seemed
to
heave
and
sway
with
laughter
frau
brechenmacher
did
not
think
it
funny
she
stared
round
at
the
laughing
faces
and
suddenly
they
all
seemed
strange
to
her
she
wanted
to
go
home
and
never
come
out
again
she
imagined
that
all
these
people
were
laughing
at
her
more
people
than
there
were
in
the
room
laughing
at
her
because
they
were
so
much
stronger
than
she
was
they
walked
home
in
silence
herr
brechenmacher
strode
ahead
she
stumbled
after
him
white
and
forsaken
lay
the
road
from
the
railway
station
to
their
cold
rush
of
wind
blew
her
hood
from
her
face
and
suddenly
she
remembered
how
they
had
come
home
together
the
first
night
now
they
had
five
babies
and
twice
as
much
money
na
what
is
it
all
for
she
muttered
and
not
until
she
had
reached
home
and
prepared
a
little
supper
of
meat
and
bread
for
her
man
did
she
stop
asking
herself
that
silly
question
herr
brechenmacher
broke
the
bread
into
his
plate
smeared
it
round
with
his
fork
and
chewed
greedily
good
she
asked
leaning
her
arms
on
the
table
and
pillowing
her
breast
against
them
but
fine
he
took
a
piece
of
the
crumb
wiped
it
round
his
plate
edge
and
held
it
up
to
her
mouth
she
shook
her
head
not
hungry
she
said
but
it
is
one
of
the
best
pieces
and
full
of
the
he
cleared
the
plate
then
pulled
off
his
boots
and
flung
them
into
a
corner
not
much
of
a
wedding
he
said
stretching
out
his
feet
and
wriggling
his
toes
in
the
worsted
socks
she
replied
taking
up
the
discarded
boots
and
placing
them
on
the
oven
to
dry
herr
brechenmacher
yawned
and
stretched
himself
and
then
looked
up
at
her
grinning
remember
the
night
that
we
came
home
you
were
an
innocent
one
you
get
along
such
a
time
ago
i
well
she
remembered
such
a
clout
on
the
ear
as
you
gave
me
but
i
soon
taught
oh
don
t
start
talking
you
ve
too
much
beer
come
to
he
tilted
back
in
his
chair
chuckling
with
laughter
that
s
not
what
you
said
to
me
that
night
god
the
trouble
you
gave
me
but
the
little
frau
seized
the
candle
and
went
into
the
next
room
the
children
were
all
soundly
sleeping
she
stripped
the
mattress
off
the
baby
s
bed
to
see
if
he
was
still
dry
then
began
unfastening
her
blouse
and
skirt
always
the
same
she
all
over
the
world
the
same
but
god
in
then
even
the
memory
of
the
wedding
faded
quite
she
lay
down
on
the
bed
and
put
her
arm
across
her
face
like
a
child
who
expected
to
be
hurt
as
herr
brechenmacher
lurched
in
the
modern
soul
said
the
herr
professor
squeezing
my
hand
wonderful
weather
i
have
just
returned
from
a
party
in
the
wood
i
have
been
making
music
for
them
on
my
trombone
you
know
these
provide
most
suitable
accompaniment
for
a
trombone
they
are
sighing
delicacy
against
sustained
strength
as
i
remarked
once
in
a
lecture
on
wind
instruments
in
frankfort
may
i
be
permitted
to
sit
beside
you
on
this
bench
gnädige
frau
he
sat
down
tugging
at
a
package
in
the
tail
pocket
of
his
coat
cherries
he
said
nodding
and
smiling
there
is
nothing
like
cherries
for
producing
free
saliva
after
trombone
playing
especially
after
grieg
s
ich
liebe
those
sustained
blasts
on
liebe
make
my
throat
as
dry
as
a
railway
tunnel
have
some
he
shook
the
bag
at
me
i
prefer
watching
you
eat
ah
ha
he
crossed
his
legs
sticking
the
cherry
bag
between
his
knees
to
leave
both
hands
free
psychologically
i
understood
your
refusal
it
is
your
innate
feminine
delicacy
in
preferring
etherealised
sensations
or
perhaps
you
do
not
care
to
eat
the
worms
all
cherries
contain
worms
once
i
made
a
very
interesting
experiment
with
a
colleague
of
mine
at
the
university
we
bit
into
four
pounds
of
the
best
cherries
and
did
not
find
one
specimen
without
a
worm
but
what
would
you
as
i
remarked
to
him
friend
it
amounts
to
this
if
one
wishes
to
satisfy
the
desires
of
nature
one
must
be
strong
enough
to
ignore
the
facts
of
nature
the
conversation
is
not
out
of
your
depth
i
have
so
seldom
the
time
or
opportunity
to
open
my
heart
to
a
woman
that
i
am
apt
to
i
looked
at
him
brightly
see
what
a
fat
one
cried
the
herr
professor
that
is
almost
a
mouthful
in
itself
it
is
beautiful
enough
to
hang
from
a
he
chewed
it
up
and
spat
the
stone
an
incredible
the
garden
path
into
the
flower
bed
he
was
proud
of
the
feat
i
saw
it
the
quantity
of
fruit
i
have
eaten
on
this
bench
he
sighed
apricots
peaches
and
cherries
one
day
that
garden
bed
will
become
an
orchard
grove
and
i
shall
allow
you
to
pick
as
much
as
you
please
without
paying
me
i
was
grateful
without
showing
undue
excitement
which
reminds
me
hit
the
side
of
his
nose
with
one
the
manager
of
the
pension
handed
me
my
weekly
bill
after
dinner
this
evening
it
is
almost
impossible
to
credit
i
do
not
expect
you
to
believe
has
charged
me
extra
for
a
miserable
little
glass
of
milk
i
drink
in
bed
at
night
to
prevent
insomnia
naturally
i
did
not
pay
but
the
tragedy
of
the
story
is
this
i
can
not
expect
the
milk
to
produce
somnolence
any
longer
my
peaceful
attitude
of
mind
towards
it
is
completely
destroyed
i
know
i
shall
throw
myself
into
a
fever
in
attempting
to
plumb
this
want
of
generosity
in
so
wealthy
a
man
as
the
manager
of
a
pension
think
of
me
ground
the
empty
bag
under
his
think
that
the
worst
is
happening
to
me
as
your
head
drops
asleep
on
your
two
ladies
came
on
the
front
steps
of
the
pension
and
stood
arm
in
arm
looking
over
the
garden
the
one
old
and
scraggy
dressed
almost
entirely
in
black
bead
trimming
and
a
satin
reticule
the
other
young
and
thin
in
a
white
gown
her
yellow
hair
tastefully
garnished
with
mauve
sweet
peas
the
professor
drew
in
his
feet
and
sat
up
sharply
pulling
down
his
waistcoat
the
godowskas
he
murmured
do
you
know
them
a
mother
and
daughter
from
vienna
the
mother
has
an
internal
complaint
and
the
daughter
is
an
actress
fräulein
sonia
is
a
very
modern
soul
i
think
you
would
find
her
most
sympathetic
she
is
forced
to
be
in
attendance
on
her
mother
just
now
but
what
a
temperament
i
have
once
described
her
in
her
autograph
album
as
a
tigress
with
a
flower
in
the
hair
will
you
excuse
me
perhaps
i
can
persuade
them
to
be
introduced
to
i
said
i
am
going
up
to
my
but
the
professor
rose
and
shook
a
playful
finger
at
me
na
he
said
we
are
friends
and
therefore
i
shall
speak
quite
frankly
to
you
i
think
they
would
consider
it
a
little
marked
if
you
immediately
retired
to
the
house
at
their
approach
after
sitting
here
alone
with
me
in
the
twilight
you
know
this
world
yes
you
know
it
as
i
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
remarking
with
one
eye
that
while
the
professor
had
been
talking
the
godowskas
had
trailed
across
the
lawn
towards
us
they
confronted
the
herr
professor
as
he
stood
up
quavered
frau
godowska
wonderful
weather
it
has
given
me
quite
a
touch
of
hay
fever
fräulein
godowska
said
nothing
she
swooped
over
a
rose
growing
in
the
embryo
orchard
then
stretched
out
her
hand
with
a
magnificent
gesture
to
the
herr
professor
he
presented
me
this
is
my
little
english
friend
of
whom
i
have
spoken
she
is
the
stranger
in
our
midst
we
have
been
eating
cherries
how
delightful
sighed
frau
godowska
my
daughter
and
i
have
often
observed
you
through
the
bedroom
window
haven
t
we
sonia
sonia
absorbed
my
outward
and
visible
form
with
an
inward
and
spiritual
glance
then
repeated
the
magnificent
gesture
for
my
benefit
the
four
of
us
sat
on
the
bench
with
that
faint
air
of
excitement
of
passengers
established
in
a
railway
carriage
on
the
qui
vive
for
the
train
whistle
frau
godowska
sneezed
i
wonder
if
it
is
hay
fever
she
remarked
worrying
the
satin
reticule
for
her
handkerchief
or
would
it
be
the
dew
sonia
dear
is
the
dew
falling
fräulein
sonia
raised
her
face
to
the
sky
and
half
closed
her
eyes
no
mamma
my
face
is
quite
warm
oh
look
herr
professor
there
are
swallows
in
flight
they
are
like
a
little
flock
of
japanese
wahr
where
cried
the
herr
professor
oh
yes
i
see
by
the
kitchen
chimney
but
why
do
you
say
japanese
could
you
not
compare
them
with
equal
veracity
to
a
little
flock
of
german
thoughts
in
flight
he
rounded
on
me
have
you
swallows
in
england
i
believe
there
are
some
at
certain
seasons
but
doubtless
they
have
not
the
same
symbolical
value
for
the
english
in
i
have
never
been
to
england
interrupted
fräulein
sonia
but
i
have
many
english
acquaintances
they
are
so
cold
she
shivered
snapped
frau
godowska
without
soul
without
heart
without
grace
but
you
can
not
equal
their
dress
materials
i
spent
a
week
in
brighton
twenty
years
ago
and
the
travelling
cape
i
bought
there
is
not
yet
worn
one
you
wrap
the
bottle
in
sonia
my
lamented
husband
your
father
sonia
knew
a
great
deal
about
england
but
the
more
he
knew
about
it
the
oftener
he
remarked
to
me
england
is
merely
an
island
of
beef
flesh
swimming
in
a
warm
gulf
sea
of
such
a
brilliant
way
of
putting
things
do
you
remember
sonia
i
forget
nothing
mamma
answered
sonia
said
the
herr
professor
that
is
the
proof
of
your
calling
gnädiges
fräulein
now
i
this
is
a
very
interesting
memory
a
blessing
the
curse
frau
godowska
looked
into
the
distance
then
the
corners
of
her
mouth
dropped
and
her
skin
puckered
she
began
to
shed
tears
ach
gott
gracious
lady
what
have
i
said
exclaimed
the
herr
professor
sonia
took
her
mother
s
hand
do
you
know
she
said
it
is
stewed
carrots
and
nut
tart
for
supper
suppose
we
go
in
and
take
our
places
her
sidelong
tragic
stare
accusing
the
professor
and
me
the
while
i
followed
them
across
the
lawn
and
up
the
steps
frau
godowska
was
murmuring
such
a
wonderful
beloved
man
with
her
disengaged
hand
fräulein
sonia
was
arranging
the
a
concert
for
the
benefit
of
afflicted
catholic
infants
will
take
place
in
the
salon
at
artists
fräulein
sonia
godowska
from
vienna
herr
professor
windberg
and
his
trombone
frau
oberlehrer
weidel
and
this
notice
was
tied
round
the
neck
of
the
melancholy
stag
s
head
in
the
it
graced
him
like
a
red
and
white
dinner
bib
for
days
before
the
event
causing
the
herr
professor
to
bow
before
it
and
say
good
appetite
until
we
sickened
of
his
pleasantry
and
left
the
smiling
to
be
done
by
the
waiter
who
was
paid
to
be
pleasing
to
the
guests
on
the
appointed
day
the
married
ladies
sailed
about
the
pension
dressed
like
upholstered
chairs
and
the
unmarried
ladies
like
draped
muslin
covers
frau
godowska
pinned
a
rose
in
the
centre
of
her
reticule
another
blossom
was
tucked
in
the
mazy
folds
of
a
white
antimacassar
thrown
across
her
breast
the
gentlemen
wore
black
coats
white
silk
ties
and
ferny
buttonholes
tickling
the
chin
the
floor
of
the
salon
was
freshly
polished
chairs
and
benches
arranged
and
a
row
of
little
flags
strung
across
the
flew
and
jigged
in
the
draught
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
family
washing
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
sit
beside
frau
godowska
and
that
the
herr
professor
and
sonia
should
join
us
when
their
share
of
the
concert
was
over
that
will
make
you
feel
quite
one
of
the
performers
said
the
herr
professor
genially
it
is
a
great
pity
that
the
english
nation
is
so
unmusical
never
mind
you
shall
hear
have
discovered
a
nest
of
talent
during
the
what
do
you
intend
to
recite
fräulein
sonia
she
shook
back
her
hair
i
never
know
until
the
last
moment
when
i
come
on
the
stage
i
wait
for
one
moment
and
then
i
have
the
sensation
as
though
something
struck
me
here
placed
her
hand
upon
her
collar
and
words
come
bend
down
a
moment
whispered
her
mother
sonia
love
your
skirt
is
showing
at
the
back
shall
i
come
outside
and
fasten
it
properly
for
you
or
will
you
do
it
yourself
oh
mamma
please
don
t
say
such
things
sonia
flushed
and
grew
very
angry
you
know
how
sensitive
i
am
to
the
slightest
unsympathetic
impression
at
a
time
like
this
i
would
rather
my
skirt
dropped
off
my
heart
a
bell
tinkled
the
waiter
came
in
and
opened
the
piano
in
the
heated
excitement
of
the
moment
he
entirely
forgot
what
was
fitting
and
flicked
the
keys
with
the
grimy
table
napkin
he
carried
over
his
arm
the
frau
oberlehrer
tripped
on
the
platform
followed
by
a
very
young
gentleman
who
blew
his
nose
twice
before
he
hurled
his
handkerchief
into
the
bosom
of
the
piano
yes
i
know
you
have
no
love
for
me
and
no
no
love
no
heart
and
no
sang
the
frau
oberlehrer
in
a
voice
that
seemed
to
issue
from
her
forgotten
thimble
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
ach
how
sweet
how
delicate
we
cried
clapping
her
soothingly
she
bowed
as
though
to
say
yes
isn
t
it
and
retired
the
very
young
gentleman
dodging
her
train
and
scowling
the
piano
was
closed
an
was
placed
in
the
centre
of
the
platform
fräulein
sonia
drifted
towards
it
a
breathless
pause
then
presumably
the
winged
shaft
struck
her
collar
brooch
she
implored
us
not
to
go
into
the
woods
in
trained
dresses
but
rather
as
lightly
draped
as
possible
and
bed
with
her
among
the
pine
needles
her
loud
slightly
harsh
voice
filled
the
salon
she
dropped
her
arms
over
the
back
of
the
chair
moving
her
lean
hands
from
the
wrists
we
were
thrilled
and
silent
the
herr
professor
beside
me
abnormally
serious
his
eyes
bulging
pulled
at
his
moustache
ends
frau
godowska
adopted
that
peculiarly
detached
attitude
of
the
proud
parent
the
only
soul
who
remained
untouched
by
her
appeal
was
the
waiter
who
leaned
idly
against
the
wall
of
the
salon
and
cleaned
his
nails
with
the
edge
of
a
programme
he
was
off
duty
and
intended
to
show
it
what
did
i
say
shouted
the
herr
professor
under
cover
of
tumultuous
applause
there
you
have
it
she
is
a
flame
in
the
heart
of
a
lily
i
know
i
am
going
to
play
well
it
is
my
turn
now
i
am
inspired
fräulein
sonia
that
lady
returned
to
us
pale
and
draped
in
a
large
you
are
my
inspiration
you
shall
be
the
soul
of
my
trombone
wait
to
right
and
left
of
us
people
bent
over
and
whispered
admiration
down
fräulein
sonia
s
neck
she
bowed
in
the
grand
style
i
am
always
successful
she
said
to
me
you
see
when
i
act
i
am
in
vienna
in
the
plays
of
ibsen
we
had
so
many
bouquets
that
the
cook
had
three
in
the
kitchen
but
it
is
difficult
here
there
is
so
little
magic
do
you
not
feel
it
there
is
none
of
that
mysterious
perfume
which
floats
almost
as
a
visible
thing
from
the
souls
of
the
viennese
audiences
my
spirit
starves
for
want
of
she
leaned
forward
chin
on
hand
starves
she
repeated
the
professor
appeared
with
his
trombone
blew
into
it
held
it
up
to
one
eye
tucked
back
his
shirt
cuffs
and
wallowed
in
the
soul
of
sonia
godowska
such
a
sensation
did
he
create
that
he
was
recalled
to
play
a
bavarian
dance
which
he
acknowledged
was
to
be
taken
as
a
breathing
exercise
rather
than
an
artistic
achievement
frau
godowska
kept
time
to
it
with
a
fan
followed
the
very
young
gentleman
who
piped
in
a
tenor
voice
that
he
loved
somebody
with
blood
in
his
heart
and
a
thousand
fräulein
sonia
acted
a
poison
scene
with
the
assistance
of
her
mother
s
pill
vial
and
the
replaced
by
a
chaise
longue
a
young
girl
scratched
a
lullaby
on
a
young
fiddle
and
the
herr
professor
performed
the
last
sacrificial
rites
on
the
altar
of
the
afflicted
children
by
playing
the
national
anthem
now
i
must
put
mamma
to
bed
whispered
fräulein
sonia
but
afterwards
i
must
take
a
walk
it
is
imperative
that
i
free
my
spirit
in
the
open
air
for
a
moment
would
you
come
with
me
as
far
as
the
railway
station
and
back
very
well
then
knock
on
my
door
when
you
re
thus
the
modern
soul
and
i
found
ourselves
together
under
the
stars
what
a
night
she
said
do
you
know
that
poem
of
sappho
about
her
hands
in
the
stars
i
am
curiously
sapphic
and
this
is
so
only
am
i
sapphic
i
find
in
all
the
works
of
all
the
greatest
writers
especially
in
their
unedited
letters
some
touch
some
sign
of
resemblance
some
part
of
myself
like
a
thousand
reflections
of
my
own
hands
in
a
dark
but
what
a
bother
said
i
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
by
bother
is
it
rather
the
curse
of
my
genius
she
paused
suddenly
staring
at
me
do
you
know
my
tragedy
she
asked
i
shook
my
head
my
tragedy
is
my
mother
living
with
her
i
live
with
the
coffin
of
my
unborn
aspirations
you
heard
that
about
the
it
may
seem
to
you
a
little
thing
but
it
ruined
my
three
first
gestures
they
impaled
on
a
i
suggested
yes
exactly
that
and
when
we
are
in
vienna
i
am
the
victim
of
moods
you
know
i
long
to
do
wild
passionate
things
and
mamma
says
please
pour
out
my
mixture
once
i
remember
i
flew
into
a
rage
and
threw
a
washstand
jug
out
of
the
window
do
you
know
what
she
said
sonia
it
is
not
so
much
throwing
things
out
of
windows
if
only
you
choose
something
smaller
said
i
no
tell
me
about
it
humiliating
and
i
do
not
see
any
possible
light
out
of
this
why
don
t
you
join
a
touring
company
and
leave
your
mother
in
vienna
what
leave
my
poor
little
sick
widowed
mother
in
vienna
sooner
than
that
i
would
drown
myself
i
love
my
mother
as
i
love
nobody
else
in
the
and
nothing
do
you
think
it
is
impossible
to
love
one
s
tragedy
out
of
my
great
sorrows
i
make
my
little
songs
that
is
heine
or
oh
well
that
s
all
right
i
said
cheerfully
but
it
is
not
all
right
i
suggested
we
should
turn
back
we
turned
sometimes
i
think
the
solution
lies
in
marriage
said
fräulein
sonia
if
i
find
a
simple
peaceful
man
who
adores
me
and
will
look
after
man
who
would
be
for
me
a
genius
can
not
hope
to
shall
marry
him
you
know
the
herr
professor
has
paid
me
very
marked
oh
fräulein
sonia
i
said
very
pleased
with
myself
why
not
marry
him
to
your
mother
we
were
passing
the
hairdresser
s
shop
at
the
moment
fräulein
sonia
clutched
my
arm
you
you
she
stammered
the
cruelty
i
am
going
to
faint
mamma
to
marry
again
before
i
indignity
i
am
going
to
faint
here
and
i
was
frightened
you
can
t
i
said
shaking
her
come
back
to
the
pension
and
faint
as
much
as
you
please
but
you
can
t
faint
here
all
the
shops
are
closed
there
is
nobody
about
please
don
t
be
so
here
and
here
only
she
indicated
the
exact
spot
and
dropped
quite
beautifully
lying
motionless
very
well
i
said
faint
away
but
please
hurry
over
she
did
not
move
i
began
to
walk
home
but
each
time
i
looked
behind
me
i
saw
the
dark
form
of
the
modern
soul
prone
before
the
hairdresser
s
window
finally
i
ran
and
rooted
out
the
herr
professor
from
his
room
fräulein
sonia
has
fainted
i
said
crossly
du
lieber
gott
where
how
outside
the
hairdresser
s
shop
in
the
station
jesus
and
maria
has
she
no
water
with
her
seized
his
nobody
beside
her
where
is
my
coat
no
matter
i
shall
catch
a
cold
on
the
chest
willingly
i
shall
catch
one
you
are
ready
to
come
with
me
no
i
said
you
can
take
the
but
she
must
have
a
woman
i
can
not
be
so
indelicate
as
to
attempt
to
loosen
her
modern
souls
oughtn
t
to
wear
them
said
i
he
pushed
past
me
and
clattered
down
the
stairs
when
i
came
down
to
breakfast
next
morning
there
were
two
places
vacant
at
table
fräulein
sonia
and
herr
professor
had
gone
off
for
a
day
s
excursion
in
the
woods
i
wondered
at
lehmann
s
certainly
sabina
did
not
find
life
slow
she
was
on
the
trot
from
early
morning
until
late
at
night
at
five
o
clock
she
tumbled
out
of
bed
buttoned
on
her
clothes
wearing
a
alpaca
pinafore
over
her
black
frock
and
groped
her
way
downstairs
into
the
kitchen
anna
the
cook
had
grown
so
fat
during
the
summer
that
she
adored
her
bed
because
she
did
not
have
to
wear
her
corsets
there
but
could
spread
as
much
as
she
liked
roll
about
under
the
great
mattress
calling
upon
jesus
and
holy
mary
and
blessed
anthony
himself
that
her
life
was
not
fit
for
a
pig
in
a
cellar
sabina
was
new
to
her
work
pink
colour
still
flew
in
her
cheeks
there
was
a
little
dimple
on
the
left
side
of
her
mouth
that
even
when
she
was
most
serious
most
absorbed
popped
out
and
gave
her
away
and
anna
blessed
that
dimple
it
meant
an
extra
in
bed
for
her
it
made
sabina
light
the
fire
turn
out
the
kitchen
and
wash
endless
cups
and
saucers
that
had
been
left
over
from
the
evening
before
hans
the
scullery
boy
did
not
come
until
seven
he
was
the
son
of
the
mean
undersized
child
very
much
like
one
of
his
father
s
sausages
sabina
thought
his
red
face
was
covered
with
pimples
and
his
nails
indescribably
filthy
when
herr
lehmann
himself
told
hans
to
get
a
hairpin
and
clean
them
he
said
they
were
stained
from
birth
because
his
mother
had
always
got
so
inky
doing
the
sabina
believed
him
and
pitied
him
winter
had
come
very
early
to
mindelbau
by
the
end
of
october
the
streets
were
banked
with
snow
and
the
greater
number
of
the
cure
guests
sick
unto
death
of
cold
water
and
herbs
had
departed
in
nothing
approaching
peace
so
the
large
salon
was
shut
at
lehmann
s
and
the
was
all
the
accommodation
the
café
afforded
here
the
floor
had
to
be
washed
over
the
tables
rubbed
set
out
each
with
its
little
china
platter
of
sugar
and
newspapers
and
magazines
hung
on
their
hooks
along
the
walls
before
herr
lehmann
appeared
at
and
opened
business
as
a
rule
his
wife
served
in
the
shop
leading
into
the
café
but
she
had
chosen
the
quiet
season
to
have
a
baby
and
a
big
woman
at
the
best
of
times
she
had
grown
so
enormous
in
the
process
that
her
husband
told
her
she
looked
unappetising
and
had
better
remain
upstairs
and
sew
sabina
took
on
the
extra
work
without
any
thought
of
extra
pay
she
loved
to
stand
behind
the
counter
cutting
up
slices
of
anna
s
marvellous
confections
or
doing
up
packets
of
sugar
almonds
in
pink
and
blue
striped
bags
you
ll
get
varicose
veins
like
me
said
anna
that
s
what
the
frau
s
got
too
no
wonder
the
baby
doesn
t
come
all
her
swelling
s
got
into
her
and
hans
was
immensely
interested
during
the
morning
business
was
comparatively
slack
sabina
answered
the
shop
bell
attended
to
a
few
customers
who
drank
a
liqueur
to
warm
their
stomachs
before
the
midday
meal
and
ran
upstairs
now
and
again
to
ask
the
frau
if
she
wanted
anything
but
in
the
afternoon
six
or
seven
choice
spirits
played
cards
and
everybody
who
was
anybody
drank
tea
or
coffee
sabina
sabina
she
flew
from
one
table
to
the
other
counting
out
handfuls
of
small
change
giving
orders
to
anna
through
the
slide
helping
the
men
with
their
heavy
coats
always
with
that
magical
child
air
about
her
that
delightful
sense
of
perpetually
attending
a
party
how
is
the
frau
lehmann
the
women
would
whisper
she
feels
rather
low
but
as
well
as
can
be
expected
sabina
would
answer
nodding
confidentially
frau
lehmann
s
bad
time
was
approaching
anna
and
her
friends
referred
to
it
as
her
journey
to
rome
and
sabina
longed
to
ask
questions
yet
being
ashamed
of
her
ignorance
was
silent
trying
to
puzzle
it
out
for
herself
she
knew
practically
nothing
except
that
the
frau
had
a
baby
inside
her
which
had
to
come
painful
indeed
one
could
not
have
one
without
a
she
also
realised
but
what
had
the
man
got
to
do
with
it
so
she
wondered
as
she
sat
mending
tea
towels
in
the
evening
head
bent
over
her
work
light
shining
on
her
brown
curls
was
it
wondered
sabina
a
simple
thing
she
had
a
little
picture
of
her
dead
grandmother
dressed
in
a
black
silk
frock
tired
hands
clasping
the
crucifix
that
dragged
between
her
flattened
breasts
mouth
curiously
tight
yet
almost
secretly
smiling
but
the
grandmother
had
been
born
was
the
important
fact
as
she
sat
there
one
evening
thinking
the
young
man
entered
the
café
and
called
for
a
glass
of
port
wine
sabina
rose
slowly
the
long
day
and
the
hot
room
made
her
feel
a
little
languid
but
as
she
poured
out
the
wine
she
felt
the
young
man
s
eyes
fixed
on
her
looked
down
at
him
and
dimpled
it
s
cold
out
she
said
corking
the
bottle
the
young
man
ran
his
hands
through
his
hair
and
laughed
i
wouldn
t
call
it
exactly
tropical
he
said
but
you
re
very
snug
in
as
though
you
ve
been
very
languid
felt
sabina
in
the
hot
room
and
the
young
man
s
voice
was
strong
and
deep
she
thought
she
had
never
seen
anybody
who
looked
so
though
he
could
take
up
the
table
in
one
his
restless
gaze
wandering
over
her
face
and
figure
gave
her
a
curious
thrill
deep
in
her
body
half
pleasure
half
pain
she
wanted
to
stand
there
close
beside
him
while
he
drank
his
wine
a
little
silence
followed
then
he
took
a
book
out
of
his
pocket
and
sabina
went
back
to
her
sewing
sitting
there
in
the
corner
she
listened
to
the
sound
of
the
leaves
being
turned
and
the
loud
ticking
of
the
clock
that
hung
over
the
gilt
mirror
she
wanted
to
look
at
him
was
a
something
about
him
in
his
deep
voice
even
in
the
way
his
clothes
fitted
from
the
room
above
she
heard
the
heavy
dragging
sound
of
frau
lehmann
s
footsteps
and
again
the
old
thoughts
worried
sabina
if
she
herself
should
one
day
look
like
like
that
yet
it
would
be
very
sweet
to
have
a
little
baby
to
dress
and
jump
up
and
down
s
your
are
you
smiling
at
called
the
young
man
she
blushed
and
looked
up
hands
quiet
in
her
lap
looked
across
the
empty
tables
and
shook
her
head
come
here
and
i
ll
show
you
a
picture
he
commanded
she
went
and
stood
beside
him
he
opened
the
book
and
sabina
saw
a
coloured
sketch
of
a
naked
girl
sitting
on
the
edge
of
a
great
crumpled
bed
a
man
s
opera
hat
on
the
back
of
her
head
he
put
his
hand
over
the
body
leaving
only
the
face
exposed
then
scrutinised
sabina
closely
well
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
knowing
perfectly
well
why
it
might
be
your
own
face
i
s
as
far
as
i
can
but
the
hair
s
done
differently
said
sabina
laughing
she
threw
back
her
head
and
the
laughter
bubbled
in
her
round
white
throat
it
s
rather
a
nice
picture
don
t
you
think
he
asked
but
she
was
looking
at
a
curious
ring
he
wore
on
the
hand
that
covered
the
girl
s
body
and
only
nodded
ever
seen
anything
like
it
before
oh
there
s
plenty
of
those
funny
ones
in
the
illustrated
how
would
you
like
to
have
your
picture
taken
that
way
me
i
d
never
let
anybody
see
it
besides
i
haven
t
got
a
hat
like
that
that
s
easily
again
a
little
silence
broken
by
anna
throwing
up
the
slide
sabina
ran
into
the
kitchen
here
take
this
milk
and
egg
up
to
the
frau
said
anna
who
ve
you
got
in
there
got
such
a
funny
man
i
think
he
s
a
little
gone
here
tapping
her
forehead
upstairs
in
the
ugly
room
the
frau
sat
sewing
a
black
shawl
round
her
shoulders
her
feet
encased
in
red
woollen
slippers
the
girl
put
the
milk
on
a
table
by
her
then
stood
polishing
a
spoon
on
her
apron
nothing
else
na
said
the
frau
heaving
up
in
her
chair
where
s
my
man
he
s
playing
cards
over
at
snipold
s
do
you
want
him
dear
heaven
leave
him
alone
i
m
nothing
i
don
t
matter
and
the
whole
day
waiting
her
hand
shook
as
she
wiped
the
rim
of
the
glass
with
her
fat
finger
shall
i
help
you
to
bed
you
go
downstairs
leave
me
alone
tell
anna
not
to
let
hans
grub
the
him
one
on
the
muttered
sabina
returning
to
the
café
where
the
young
man
stood
ready
for
departure
i
ll
come
again
said
he
don
t
twist
your
hair
back
so
tightly
it
will
lose
all
its
well
you
are
a
funny
one
she
said
by
the
time
sabina
was
ready
for
bed
anna
was
snoring
she
brushed
out
her
long
hair
and
gathered
it
in
her
hands
perhaps
it
would
be
a
pity
if
it
lost
all
its
curl
then
she
looked
down
at
her
straight
chemise
and
drawing
it
off
sat
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
i
wish
she
whispered
smiling
sleepily
there
was
a
great
big
in
this
lying
down
in
the
darkness
she
hugged
her
little
body
i
wouldn
t
be
the
frau
for
one
hundred
for
a
thousand
marks
to
look
like
and
she
imagined
herself
heaving
up
in
her
chair
with
the
port
wine
bottle
in
her
hand
as
the
young
man
entered
the
café
cold
and
dark
the
next
morning
sabina
woke
tired
feeling
as
though
something
heavy
had
been
pressing
under
her
heart
all
night
there
was
a
sound
of
footsteps
shuffling
along
the
passage
herr
lehmann
she
must
have
overslept
herself
yes
he
was
rattling
the
one
moment
one
moment
she
called
dragging
on
her
stockings
bina
tell
anna
to
go
to
the
quickly
i
must
ride
for
the
yes
yes
she
cried
has
it
come
but
he
had
gone
and
she
ran
over
to
anna
and
shook
her
by
the
shoulder
the
lehmann
for
the
nurse
she
stuttered
name
of
god
said
anna
flinging
herself
out
of
bed
no
complaints
in
anna
s
whole
bearing
you
run
downstairs
and
light
the
oven
put
on
a
pan
of
water
to
an
imaginary

she
leaned
both
elbows
on
the
her
face
in
her
hands
and
pouted
but
the
outer
door
suddenly
opening
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
laughed

the
young
man

he
ordered
more
port
and
brought
no

she
cried

how
warm
i
ll
put
more
wood
on
that
oven
it
doesn
t
matter
they
re
all
busy
she
knelt
down
on
the
floor
and
thrust
the
wood
into
the
oven
laughing
at
her
own
wicked
extravagance
the
frau
was
forgotten
the
stupid
day
was
forgotten
here
was
someone
beside
her
laughing
too
they
were
together
in
the
little
warm
room
stealing
herr
lehmann
s
wood
it
seemed
the
most
exciting
adventure
in
the
world
she
wanted
to
go
on
burst
out
hold
of
the
young
man
what
a
fire
she
shrieked
stretching
out
her
hands
here
s
a
hand
pull
up
said
the
young
man
there
now
you
ll
catch
it
they
stood
opposite
to
each
other
hands
still
clinging
and
again
that
strange
tremor
thrilled
sabina
look
here
he
said
roughly
are
you
a
child
or
are
you
playing
at
being
one
laughter
ceased
she
looked
up
at
him
once
then
down
at
the
floor
and
began
breathing
like
a
frightened
little
animal
he
pulled
her
closer
still
and
kissed
her
mouth
na
what
are
you
doing
she
whispered
he
let
go
her
hands
he
placed
his
on
her
breasts
and
the
room
seemed
to
swim
round
sabina
suddenly
from
the
room
above
a
frightful
tearing
shriek
she
wrenched
herself
away
tightened
herself
drew
herself
up
who
did
made
that
noise
in
the
silence
the
thin
wailing
of
a
baby
achk
shrieked
sabina
rushing
from
the
room
the
luft
bad
i
think
it
must
be
the
umbrellas
which
make
us
look
ridiculous
when
i
was
admitted
into
the
enclosure
for
the
first
time
and
saw
my
walking
about
very
nearly
in
their
nakeds
it
struck
me
that
the
umbrellas
gave
a
distinctly
little
black
sambo
touch
ridiculous
dignity
in
holding
over
yourself
a
green
cotton
thing
with
a
red
parroquet
handle
when
you
are
dressed
in
nothing
larger
than
a
handkerchief
there
are
no
trees
in
the
luft
it
boasts
a
collection
of
plain
wooden
cells
a
bath
shelter
two
swings
and
two
odd
presumably
the
lost
property
of
hercules
or
the
german
army
and
the
other
to
be
used
with
safety
in
the
cradle
and
there
in
all
weathers
we
take
the
or
sitting
in
little
companies
talking
over
each
other
s
ailments
and
measurements
and
ills
that
flesh
is
heir
to
a
high
wooden
wall
compasses
us
all
about
above
it
the
look
down
a
little
superciliously
nudging
each
other
in
a
way
that
is
peculiarly
trying
to
a
débutante
over
the
wall
on
the
right
side
is
the
men
s
section
we
hear
them
chopping
down
trees
and
sawing
through
planks
dashing
heavy
weights
to
the
ground
and
singing
part
songs
yes
they
take
it
far
more
seriously
on
the
first
day
i
was
conscious
of
my
legs
and
went
back
into
my
cell
three
times
to
look
at
my
watch
but
when
a
woman
with
whom
i
had
played
chess
for
three
weeks
cut
me
dead
i
took
heart
and
joined
a
circle
we
lay
curled
on
the
ground
while
a
hungarian
lady
of
immense
proportions
told
us
what
a
beautiful
tomb
she
had
bought
for
her
second
husband
a
vault
it
is
she
said
with
nice
black
railings
and
so
large
that
i
can
go
down
there
and
walk
about
both
their
photographs
are
there
with
two
very
handsome
wreaths
sent
me
by
my
first
husband
s
brother
there
is
an
enlargement
of
a
family
group
photograph
too
and
an
illuminated
address
presented
to
my
first
husband
on
his
marriage
i
am
often
there
it
makes
such
a
pleasant
excursion
for
a
fine
saturday
she
suddenly
lay
down
flat
on
her
back
took
in
six
long
breaths
and
sat
up
again
the
death
agony
was
dreadful
she
said
brightly
of
the
second
i
mean
the
first
was
run
into
by
a
furniture
wagon
and
had
fifty
marks
stolen
out
of
a
new
waistcoat
pocket
but
the
second
was
dying
for
hours
i
never
ceased
crying
even
to
put
the
children
to
a
young
russian
with
a
bang
curl
on
her
forehead
turned
to
me
can
you
do
the
salome
dance
she
asked
i
how
delightful
i
said
shall
i
do
it
now
would
you
like
to
see
me
she
sprang
to
her
feet
executed
a
series
of
amazing
contortions
for
the
next
ten
minutes
and
then
paused
panting
twisting
her
long
hair
isn
t
that
nice
she
said
and
now
i
am
perspiring
so
splendidly
i
shall
go
and
take
a
opposite
to
me
was
the
brownest
woman
i
have
ever
seen
lying
on
her
back
her
arms
clasped
over
her
head
how
long
have
you
been
here
she
was
asked
oh
i
spend
the
day
here
now
she
answered
i
am
making
my
own
cure
and
living
entirely
on
raw
vegetables
and
nuts
and
each
day
i
feel
my
spirit
is
stronger
and
purer
after
all
what
can
you
expect
the
majority
of
us
are
walking
about
with
pig
corpuscles
and
oxen
fragments
in
our
brain
the
wonder
is
the
world
is
as
good
as
it
is
now
i
live
on
the
simple
provided
food
pointed
to
a
little
bag
beside
a
lettuce
a
carrot
a
potato
and
some
nuts
are
ample
rational
nourishment
i
wash
them
under
the
tap
and
eat
them
raw
just
as
they
come
from
the
harmless
and
do
you
take
nothing
else
all
day
i
cried
water
and
perhaps
a
banana
if
i
wake
in
the
she
turned
round
and
leaned
on
one
elbow
you
yourself
dreadfully
she
said
shamelessly
how
can
you
expect
the
flame
of
the
spirit
to
burn
brightly
under
layers
of
superfluous
flesh
i
wished
she
would
not
stare
at
me
and
thought
of
going
to
look
at
my
watch
again
when
a
little
girl
wearing
a
string
of
coral
beads
joined
us
the
poor
frau
hauptmann
can
not
join
us
she
said
she
has
come
out
in
spots
all
over
on
account
of
her
nerves
she
was
very
excited
yesterday
after
having
written
two
a
delicate
woman
volunteered
the
hungarian
but
pleasant
fancy
she
has
a
separate
plate
for
each
of
her
front
teeth
but
she
has
no
right
to
let
her
daughters
wear
such
short
sailor
suits
they
sit
about
on
benches
crossing
their
legs
in
a
most
shameless
manner
what
are
you
going
to
do
this
afternoon
fräulein
anna
oh
said
the
coral
necklace
the
herr
oberleutnant
has
asked
me
to
go
with
him
to
landsdorf
he
must
buy
some
eggs
there
to
take
home
to
his
mother
he
saves
a
penny
on
eight
eggs
by
knowing
the
right
peasants
to
bargain

american
said
the
vegetable
lady
turning
to
me

an
englishwoman

be
one
of
the
two
you
can
not
help
it
i
have
seen
you
walking
alone
several
times
you
wear
i
got
up
and
climbed
on
to
the
swing
the
air
was
sweet
and
cool
rushing
past
my
body
above
white
clouds
trailed
delicately
through
the
blue
sky
from
the
pine
forest
streamed
a
wild
perfume
the
branches
swayed
together
rhythmically
sonorously
i
felt
so
light
and
free
and
childish
i
wanted
to
poke
my
tongue
out
at
the
circle
on
the
grass
who
drawing
close
together
were
whispering
meaningly
perhaps
you
do
not
know
cried
a
voice
from
one
of
the
cells
to
swing
is
very
upsetting
for
the
stomach
a
friend
of
mine
could
keep
nothing
down
for
three
weeks
after
exciting
herself
i
went
to
the
bath
shelter
and
was
hosed
as
i
dressed
someone
tapped
on
the
wall
do
you
know
said
a
voice
there
is
a
man
who
lives
in
the
luft
bad
next
door
he
buries
himself
up
to
the
armpits
in
mud
and
refuses
to
believe
in
the
the
umbrellas
are
the
saving
grace
of
the
luft

now
when
i
go
i
take
my
husband

ashamed
of
my
legs
a
birthday
andreas
binzer
woke
slowly
he
turned
over
on
the
narrow
bed
and
stretched
his
mouth
as
widely
as
possible
and
bringing
his
teeth
together
afterwards
with
a
sharp
the
sound
of
that
click
fascinated
him
he
repeated
it
quickly
several
times
with
a
snapping
movement
of
the
jaws
what
teeth
he
thought
sound
as
a
bell
every
man
jack
of
them
never
had
one
out
never
had
one
stopped
that
comes
of
no
tomfoolery
in
eating
and
a
good
regular
brushing
night
and
morning
he
raised
himself
on
his
left
elbow
and
waved
his
right
arm
over
the
side
of
the
bed
to
feel
for
the
chair
where
he
put
his
watch
and
chain
overnight
no
chair
was
course
he
d
forgotten
there
wasn
t
a
chair
in
this
wretched
spare
room
had
to
put
the
confounded
thing
under
his
pillow
eight
sunday
breakfast
at
for
the
bath
brain
ticked
to
the
watch
he
sprang
out
of
bed
and
went
over
to
the
window
the
venetian
blind
was
broken
hung
over
the
upper
pane
that
blind
must
be
mended
i
ll
get
the
office
boy
to
drop
in
and
fix
it
on
his
way
home
s
a
good
hand
at
blinds
give
him
twopence
and
he
ll
do
it
as
well
as
a
carpenter
anna
could
do
it
herself
if
she
was
all
right
so
would
i
for
the
matter
of
that
but
i
don
t
like
to
trust
myself
on
rickety
he
looked
up
at
the
sky
it
shone
strangely
white
unflecked
with
cloud
he
looked
down
at
the
row
of
garden
strips
and
backyards
the
fence
of
these
gardens
was
built
along
the
edge
of
a
gully
spanned
by
an
iron
suspension
bridge
and
the
people
had
a
wretched
habit
of
throwing
their
empty
tins
over
the
fence
into
the
gully
just
like
them
of
course
andreas
started
counting
the
tins
and
decided
viciously
to
write
a
letter
to
the
papers
about
it
and
sign
it
in
full
the
servant
girl
came
out
of
their
back
door
into
the
yard
carrying
his
boots
she
threw
one
down
on
the
ground
thrust
her
hand
into
the
other
and
stared
at
it
sucking
in
her
cheeks
suddenly
she
bent
forward
spat
on
the
toecap
and
started
polishing
with
a
brush
rooted
out
of
her
apron
pocket
slut
of
a
girl
heaven
knows
what
infectious
disease
may
be
breeding
now
in
that
boot
anna
must
get
rid
of
that
if
she
has
to
do
without
one
for
a
soon
as
she
s
up
and
about
again
the
way
she
chucked
one
boot
down
and
then
spat
upon
the
other
she
didn
t
care
whose
boots
she
d
got
hold
of
she
had
no
false
notions
of
the
respect
due
to
the
master
of
the
he
turned
away
from
the
window
and
switched
his
bath
towel
from
the
washstand
rail
sick
at
heart
i
m
too
sensitive
for
a
s
what
s
the
matter
with
me
have
been
from
the
beginning
and
will
be
to
the
there
was
a
gentle
knock
at
the
door
and
his
mother
came
in
she
closed
the
door
after
her
and
leant
against
it
andreas
noticed
that
her
cap
was
crooked
and
a
long
tail
of
hair
hung
over
her
shoulder
he
went
forward
and
kissed
her
mother
how
s
anna
the
old
woman
spoke
quickly
clasping
and
unclasping
her
hands
andreas
please
go
to
doctor
erb
as
soon
as
you
are
why
he
said
is
she
bad
frau
binzer
nodded
and
andreas
watching
her
saw
her
face
suddenly
change
a
fine
network
of
wrinkles
seemed
to
pull
over
it
from
under
the
skin
surface
sit
down
on
the
bed
a
moment
he
said
been
up
all
night
yes
no
i
won
t
sit
down
i
must
go
back
to
her
anna
has
been
in
pain
all

she
wouldn
t
have
you
disturbed
before
because
she
said
you
looked
so
run
down
yesterday
you
told
her
you
had
caught
a
cold
and
been
very
straightway
andreas
felt
that
he
was
being
accused
well
she
made
me
tell
her
worried
it
out
of
me
you
know
the
way
she
again
frau
binzer
nodded
oh

cold
better
and
there
s
a
warm
undervest
for
you
in
the
corner
of
the
big
quite
automatically
andreas
cleared
his
throat
twice
yes
he
answered

her
my
throat

feels
looser
i
suppose
i
d
better
not
disturb
her
no
and
besides
time
i
ll
be
ready
in
five
they
went
into
the
passage
as
frau
binzer
opened
the
door
of
the
front
bedroom
a
long
wail
came
from
the
room
that
shocked
and
terrified
andreas
he
dashed
into
the
bathroom
turned
on
both
taps
as
far
as
they
would
go
cleaned
his
teeth
and
pared
his
nails
while
the
water
was
running
frightful
business
frightful
business
he
heard
himself
whispering
and
i
can
t
understand
it
it
isn
t
as
though
it
were
her
s
her
third
old
schäfer

to
have

a
qualified
nurse

her
mother

i
wonder
what
she
meant
by
saying

d
worried
anna
yesterday
nice
remark
to
make
to
a
husband
at
a
time
like
this
unstrung
i
my
sensitiveness
when
he
went
into
the
kitchen
for
his
boots
the
servant
girl
was
bent
over
the
stove
cooking
breakfast
breathing
into
that
now
i
suppose
thought
andreas
and
was
very
short
with
the
servant
girl
she
did
not
notice
she
was
full
of
terrified
joy
and
importance
in
the
goings
on
upstairs
she
felt
she
was
learning
the
secrets
of
life
with
every
breath
she
drew
had
laid
the
table
that
morning
saying
boy
as
she
put
down

comfort
him
like
she
decided
but
the
master
gave
her
no
opening
put
an
extra
cup
and
saucer
on
the
table
he
said
the
doctor

want
some
the
doctor

servant
girl

a
spoon
out
of
a
pan
and
spilt

drops
of
grease
on
the
stove

fry
something
extra
but
the
master
had
gone
slamming
the
door
after
him
he
walked
down
the
was
nobody
about
at
and
alive
this
place
on
a
sunday
morning
as
he
crossed
the
suspension
bridge
a
strong
stench
of
fennel
and
decayed
refuse
streamed
from
the
gulley
and
again
andreas
began
concocting
a
letter
he
turned
into
the
main
road
the
shutters
were
still
up
before
the
shops
scraps
of
newspaper
hay
and
fruit
skins
strewed
the
pavement
the
gutters
were
choked
with
the
leavings
of
saturday
night
two
dogs
sprawled
in
the
middle
of
the
road
scuffling
and
biting
only
the
at
the
corner
was
open
a
young
barman
slopped
water
over
the
doorstep
fastidiously
his
lips
curling
andreas
picked
his
way
through
the
water
extraordinary
how
i
am
noticing
things
this
morning
it
s
partly
the
effect
of
sunday
i
loathe
a
sunday
when
anna
s
tied
by
the
leg
and
the
children
are
away
on
sunday
a
man
has
the
right
to
expect
his
family
everything
here
s
filthy
the
whole
place
might
be
down
with
the
plague
and
will
be
too
if
this
street
s
not
swept
away
i
d
like
to
have
a
hand
on
the
government
he
braced
his
shoulders
now
for
this
doctor
erb
is
at
breakfast
the
maid
informed
him
she
showed
him
into
the
a
dark
and
musty
place
with
some
ferns
under
a
by
the
window
he
says
he
won
t
be
a
minute
please
sir
and
there
is
a
paper
on
the
unhealthy
hole
thought
binzer
walking
over
to
the
window
and
drumming
his
fingers
on
the
glass
at
breakfast
is
he
that
s
the
mistake
i
made
turning
out
early
on
an
empty
a
milk
cart
rattled
down
the
street
the
driver
standing
at
the
back
cracking
a
whip
he
wore
an
immense
geranium
flower
stuck
in
the
lapel
of
his
coat
firm
as
a
rock
he
stood
bending
back
a
little
in
the
swaying
cart
andreas
craned
his
neck
to
watch
him
all
the
way
down
the
road
even
after
he
had
gone
listening
for
the
sharp
sound
of
those
rattling
cans
h
m
not
much
wrong
with
him
he
reflected
wouldn
t
mind
a
taste
of
that
life
myself
up
early
work
all
over
by
eleven
o
clock
nothing
to
do
but
loaf
about
all
day
until
milking
which
he
knew
was
an
exaggeration
but
he
wanted
to
pity
himself
the
maid
opened
the
door
and
stood
aside
for
doctor
erb
andreas
wheeled
round
the
two
men
shook
hands
well
binzer
said
the
doctor
jovially
brushing
some
crumbs
from
a
waistcoat
son
and
heir
becoming
importunate
up
went
binzer
s
spirits
with
a
bound
son
and
heir
by
jove
he
was
glad
to
have
to
deal
with
a
man
again
and
a
sane
fellow
this
who
came
across
this
sort
of
thing
every
day
of
the
week
that
s
about
the
measure
of
it
doctor
he
answered
smiling
and
picking
up
his
hat
mother
dragged
me
out
of
bed
this
morning
with
imperative
orders
to
bring
you
gig
will
be
round
in
a
minute
drive
back
with
me
won
t
you
extraordinary
sultry
day
you
re
as
red
as
a
beetroot
andreas
affected
to
laugh
the
doctor
had
one
annoying
he
had
the
right
to
poke
fun
at
everybody
simply
because
he
was
a
doctor
the
man
s
riddled
with
conceit
like
all
these
professionals
andreas
decided
what
sort
of
night
did
frau
binzer
have
asked
the
doctor
ah
here
s
the
gig
tell
me
on
the
way
up
sit
as
near
the
middle
as
you
can
will
you
binzer
your
weight
tilts
it
over
a
bit
one
s
the
worst
of
you
successful
business
two
stone
heavier
than
i
if
he
s
a
pound
thought
andreas
the
man
may
be
all
right
in
his
heaven
preserve
off
you
go
my
doctor
erb
flicked
the
little
brown
mare
did
your
wife
get
any
sleep
last
night
no
i
don
t
think
she
did
answered
andreas
shortly
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
m
not
satisfied
that
she
hasn
t
a
oh
your
mother
s
worth
a
dozen
nurses
cried
the
doctor
with
immense
gusto
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
m
not
keen
on
as
they
wrestle
for
a
baby
as
though
they
were
wrestling
with
death
for
the
body
of
patroclus
ever
seen
that
picture
by
an
english
artist
leighton
wonderful
of
sinew
there
he
goes
again
thought
andreas
airing
off
his
knowledge
to
make
a
fool
of
now
your
s
s
capable
does
what
she
s
told
with
a
fund
of
sympathy
look
at
these
shops
we
re
re
festering
sores
how
on
earth
this
government
can
they
re
not
so
want
a
coat
of
the
doctor
whistled
a
little
tune
and
flicked
the
mare
again
well
i
hope
the
young
shaver
won
t
give
his
mother
too
much
trouble
he
said
here
we
a
skinny
little
boy
who
had
been
sliding
up
and
down
the
back
seat
of
the
gig
sprang
out
and
held
the
horse
s
head
andreas
went
straight
into
the
and
left
the
servant
girl
to
take
the
doctor
upstairs
he
sat
down
poured
out
some
coffee
and
bit
through
half
a
roll
before
helping
himself
to
fish
then
he
noticed
there
was
no
hot
plate
for
the
whole
house
was
at
sixes
and
sevens
he
rang
the
bell
but
the
servant
girl
came
in
with
a
tray
holding
a
bowl
of
soup
and
a
hot
plate
i
ve
been
keeping
them
on
the
stove
she
simpered
ah
thanks
that
s
very
kind
of
as
he
swallowed
the
soup
his
heart
warmed
to
this
fool
of
a
girl
oh
it
s
a
good
thing
doctor
erb
has
come
volunteered
the
servant
girl
who
was
bursting
for
want
of
sympathy
h
m
h
m
said
andreas
she
waited
a
moment
expectantly
rolling
her
eyes
then
in
full
loathing
of
menkind
went
back
to
the
kitchen
and
vowed
herself
to
sterility
andreas
cleared
the
soup
bowl
and
cleared
the
fish
as
he
ate
the
room
slowly
darkened
a
faint
wind
sprang
up
and
beat
the
tree
branches
against
the
window
the
looked
over
the
breakwater
of
the
harbour
and
the
sea
swung
heavily
in
rolling
waves
wind
crept
round
the
house
moaning
drearily
we
re
in
for
a
storm
that
means
i
m
boxed
up
here
all
day
well
there
s
one
blessing
it
ll
clear
the
he
heard
the
servant
girl
rushing
importantly
round
the
house
slamming
windows
then
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
in
the
garden
unpegging
tea
towels
from
the
line
across
the
lawn
she
was
a
worker
there
was
no
doubt
about
that
he
took
up
a
book
and
wheeled
his
over
to
the
window
but
it
was
useless
too
dark
to
read
he
didn
t
believe
in
straining
his
eyes
and
gas
at
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
seemed
absurd
so
he
slipped
down
in
the
chair
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
padded
arms
and
gave
himself
up
for
once
to
idle
dreaming
a
boy
yes
it
was
bound
to
be
a
boy
this
time
what
s
your
family
binzer
oh
i
ve
two
girls
and
a
boy
a
very
nice
little
number
of
course
he
was
the
last
man
to
have
a
favourite
child
but
a
man
needed
a
son
i
m
working
up
the
business
for
my
son
binzer
son
it
would
mean
living
very
tight
for
the
next
ten
years
cutting
expenses
as
fine
as
possible
and
a
tremendous
gust
of
wind
sprang
upon
the
house
seized
it
shook
it
dropped
only
to
grip
the
more
tightly
the
waves
swelled
up
along
the
breakwater
and
were
whipped
with
broken
foam
over
the
white
sky
flew
tattered
streamers
of
grey
cloud
andreas
felt
quite
relieved
to
hear
doctor
erb
coming
down
the
stairs
he
got
up
and
lit
the
gas
mind
if
i
smoke
in
here
asked
doctor
erb
lighting
a
cigarette
before
andreas
had
time
to
answer
you
don
t
smoke
do
you
no
time
to
indulge
in
pernicious
little
habits
how
is
she
now
asked
andreas
loathing
the
man
oh
well
as
can
be
expected
poor
little
soul
she
begged
me
to
come
down
and
have
a
look
at
you
said
she
knew
you
were
with
laughing
eyes
the
doctor
looked
at
the
managed
to
peck
a
bit
i
see
eh
shouted
the
wind
shaking
the
weather
said
doctor
erb
yes
it
gets
on
anna
s
nerves
and
it
s
just
nerve
she
eh
what
s
that
retorted
the
doctor
nerve
man
alive
she
s
got
twice
the
nerve
of
you
and
me
rolled
into
one
nerve
she
s
nothing
but
nerve
a
woman
who
works
as
she
does
about
the
house
and
has
three
children
in
four
years
thrown
in
with
the
dusting
so
to
speak
he
pitched
his
cigarette
into
the
fireplace
and
frowned
at
the
window
now
he
s
accusing
me
thought
andreas
that
s
the
second
time
this
mother
and
now
this
man
taking
advantage
of
my
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
speak
and
rang
the
bell
for
the
servant
girl
clear
away
the
breakfast
things
he
ordered
i
can
t
have
them
messing
about
on
the
table
till
dinner
don
t
be
hard
on
the
girl
coaxed
doctor
erb
she
s
got
twice
the
work
to
do
at
that
binzer
s
anger
blazed
out
i
ll
trouble
you
doctor
not
to
interfere
between
me
and
my
servants
and
he
felt
a
fool
at
the
same
moment
for
not
saying
doctor
erb
was
not
perturbed
he
shook
his
head
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
began
balancing
himself
on
toe
and
heel
you
re
jagged
by
the
weather
he
said
wryly
nothing
else
a
great
storm
you
know
climate
has
an
immense
effect
upon
birth
a
fine
day
perks
a
her
heart
for
her
business
good
weather
is
as
necessary
to
a
confinement
as
it
is
to
a
washing
day
not
last
remark
of
a
professional
fossil
eh
andreas
made
no
reply
well
i
ll
be
getting
back
to
my
patient
why
don
t
you
take
a
walk
and
clear
your
head
that
s
the
idea
for
no
he
answered
i
won
t
do
that
it
s
too
he
went
back
to
his
chair
by
the
window
while
the
servant
girl
cleared
away
he
pretended
to
read
then
his
dreams
it
seemed
years
since
he
had
had
the
time
to
himself
to
dream
like
never
had
a
breathing
space
saddled
with
work
all
day
and
couldn
t
shake
it
off
in
the
evening
like
other
men
besides
anna
was
talked
of
practically
nothing
else
together
excellent
mother
she
d
make
for
a
boy
she
had
a
grip
of
things
church
bells
started
ringing
through
the
windy
air
now
sounding
as
though
from
very
far
away
then
again
as
though
all
the
churches
in
the
town
had
been
suddenly
transplanted
into
their
street
they
stirred
something
in
him
those
bells
something
vague
and
tender
just
about
that
time
anna
would
call
him
from
the
hall
andreas
come
and
have
your
coat
brushed
i
m
then
off
they
would
go
she
hanging
on
his
arm
and
looking
up
at
him
she
certainly
was
a
little
thing
he
remembered
once
saying
when
they
were
engaged
just
as
high
as
my
heart
and
she
had
jumped
on
to
a
stool
and
pulled
his
head
down
laughing
a
kid
in
those
days
younger
than
her
children
in
nature
brighter
more
go
and
spirit
in
her
the
way
she
d
run
down
the
road
to
meet
him
after
business
and
the
way
she
laughed
when
they
were
looking
for
a
house
by
jove
that
laugh
of
hers
at
the
memory
he
grinned
then
grew
suddenly
grave
marriage
certainly
changed
a
woman
far
more
than
it
did
a
man
talk
about
sobering
down
she
had
lost
all
her
go
in
two
months
well
once
this
boy
business
was
over
she
d
get
stronger
he
began
to
plan
a
little
trip
for
them
he
d
take
her
away
and
they
d
loaf
about
together
somewhere
after
all
dash
it
they
were
young
still
she
d
got
into
a
groove
he
d
have
to
force
her
out
of
it
that
s
all
he
got
up
and
went
into
the
carefully
shut
the
door
and
took
anna
s
photograph
from
the
top
of
the
piano
she
wore
a
white
dress
with
a
big
bow
of
some
soft
stuff
under
the
chin
and
stood
a
little
stiffly
holding
a
sheaf
of
artificial
poppies
and
corn
in
her
hands
delicate
she
looked
even
then
her
masses
of
hair
gave
her
that
look
she
seemed
to
droop
under
the
heavy
braids
of
it
and
yet
she
was
smiling
andreas
caught
his
breath
sharply
she
was
his
girl
posh
it
had
only
been
taken
four
years
ago
he
held
it
close
to
him
bent
forward
and
kissed
it
then
rubbed
the
glass
with
the
back
of
his
hand
at
that
moment
fainter
than
he
had
heard
in
the
passage
more
terrifying
andreas
heard
again
that
wailing
cry
the
wind
caught
it
up
in
mocking
echo
blew
it
over
the
down
the
street
far
away
from
him
he
flung
out
his
arms
i
m
so
damnably
helpless
he
said
and
then
to
the
picture
perhaps
it
s
not
as
bad
as
it
sounds
perhaps
it
is
just
my
in
the
half
light
of
the
the
smile
seemed
to
deepen
in
anna
s
portrait
and
to
become
secret
even
cruel
no
he
reflected
that
smile
is
not
at
all
her
happiest
was
a
mistake
to
let
her
have
it
taken
smiling
like
that
she
doesn
t
look
like
my
the
mother
of
my
yes
that
was
it
she
did
not
look
like
the
mother
of
a
son
who
was
going
to
be
a
partner
in
the
firm
the
picture
got
on
his
nerves
he
held
it
in
different
lights
looked
at
it
from
a
distance
sideways
spent
it
seemed
to
andreas
afterwards
a
whole
lifetime
trying
to
fit
it
in
the
more
he
played
with
it
the
deeper
grew
his
dislike
of
it
thrice
he
carried
it
over
to
the
fireplace
and
decided
to
chuck
it
behind
the
japanese
umbrella
in
the
grate
then
he
thought
it
absurd
to
waste
an
expensive
frame
there
was
no
good
in
beating
about
the
bush
anna
looked
like
a
a
might
be
a
picture
taken
just
before
or
after
death
suddenly
he
realised
that
the
wind
had
dropped
that
the
whole
house
was
still
terribly
still
cold
and
pale
with
a
disgusting
feeling
that
spiders
were
creeping
up
his
spine
and
across
his
face
he
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
hearing
doctor
erb
s
footsteps
descending
the
stairs
he
saw
doctor
erb
come
into
the
room
the
room
seemed
to
change
into
a
great
glass
bowl
that
spun
round
and
doctor
erb
seemed
to
swim
through
this
glass
bowl
towards
him
like
a
goldfish
in
a
waistcoat
my
beloved
wife
has
passed
away
he
wanted
to
shout
it
out
before
the
doctor
spoke
well
she
s
hooked
a
boy
this
time
said
doctor
erb
andreas
staggered
forward
look
out
keep
on
your
pins
said
doctor
erb
catching
binzer
s
arm
and
murmuring
as
he
felt
it
flabby
as
a
glow
spread
all
over
andreas
he
was
exultant
well
by
god
nobody
can
accuse
me
of
not
knowing
what
suffering
is
he
said
the
she
was
just
beginning
to
walk
along
a
little
white
road
with
tall
black
trees
on
either
side
a
little
road
that
led
to
nowhere
and
where
nobody
walked
at
all
when
a
hand
gripped
her
shoulder
shook
her
slapped
her
ear
oh
oh
don
t
stop
me
cried
the
let
me
get
up
you
brat
said
a
voice
get
up
and
light
the
oven
or
i
ll
shake
every
bone
out
of
your
with
an
immense
effort
she
opened
her
eyes
and
saw
the
frau
standing
by
the
baby
bundled
under
one
arm
the
three
other
children
who
shared
the
same
bed
with
the
accustomed
to
brawls
slept
on
peacefully
in
a
corner
of
the
room
the
man
was
fastening
his
braces
what
do
you
mean
by
sleeping
like
this
the
whole
night
a
sack
of
potatoes
you
ve
let
the
baby
wet
his
bed
she
did
not
answer
but
tied
her
petticoat
string
and
buttoned
on
her
plaid
frock
with
cold
shaking
fingers
there
that
s
enough
take
the
baby
into
the
kitchen
with
you
and
heat
that
cold
coffee
on
the
spirit
lamp
for
the
master
and
give
him
the
loaf
of
black
bread
out
of
the
table
drawer
don
t
guzzle
it
yourself
or
i
ll
the
frau
staggered
across
the
room
flung
herself
on
to
her
bed
drawing
the
pink
bolster
round
her
shoulders
it
was
almost
dark
in
the
kitchen
she
laid
the
baby
on
the
wooden
settle
covering
him
with
a
shawl
then
poured
the
coffee
from
the
earthenware
jug
into
the
saucepan
and
set
it
on
the
spirit
lamp
to
boil
i
m
sleepy
nodded
the
kneeling
on
the
floor
and
splitting
the
damp
pine
logs
into
little
chips
that
s
why
i
m
not
the
oven
took
a
long
time
to
light
perhaps
it
was
cold
like
herself
and
sleepy
perhaps
it
had
been
dreaming
of
a
little
white
road
with
black
trees
on
either
side
a
little
road
that
led
to
nowhere
then
the
door
was
pulled
violently
open
and
the
man
strode
in
here
what
are
you
doing
sitting
on
the
floor
he
shouted
give
me
my
coffee
i
ve
got
to
be
off
ugh
you
haven
t
even
washed
over
the
she
sprang
to
her
feet
poured
his
coffee
into
an
enamel
cup
and
gave
him
bread
and
a
knife
then
taking
a
wash
rag
from
the
sink
smeared
over
the
black
linoleumed
table
swine
of
a
s
life
mumbled
the
man
sitting
by
the
table
and
staring
out
of
the
window
at
the
bruised
sky
which
seemed
to
bulge
heavily
over
the
dull
land
he
stuffed
his
mouth
with
bread
and
then
swilled
it
down
with
the
coffee
the
child
drew
a
pail
of
water
turned
up
her
sleeves
frowning
the
while
at
her
arms
as
if
to
scold
them
for
being
so
thin
so
much
like
little
stunted
twigs
and
began
to
mop
over
the
floor
stop
sousing
about
the
water
while
i
m
here
grumbled
the
man
stop
the
baby
snivelling
it
s
been
going
on
like
that
all
the
child
gathered
the
baby
into
her
lap
and
sat
rocking
him
she
said
he
s
cutting
his
eye
teeth
that
s
what
makes
him
cry
so
and
never
seen
a
baby
dribble
like
this
she
wiped
his
mouth
and
nose
with
a
corner
of
her
skirt
some
babies
get
their
teeth
without
you
knowing
it
she
went
on
and
some
take
on
this
way
all
the
time
i
once
heard
of
a
baby
that
died
and
they
found
all
its
teeth
in
its
the
man
got
up
unhooked
his
cloak
from
the
back
of
the
door
and
flung
it
round
him
there
s
another
coming
said
he
tooth
exclaimed
the
child
startled
for
the
first
time
that
morning
out
of
her
dreadful
heaviness
and
thrusting
her
finger
into
the
baby
s
mouth
no
he
said
grimly
another
baby
now
get
on
with
your
work
it
s
time
the
others
got
up
for
she
stood
a
moment
quite
silently
hearing
his
heavy
steps
on
the
stone
passage
then
the
gravel
walk
and
finally
the
slam
of
the
front
gate
another
baby
hasn
t
she
finished
having
them
yet
thought
the
child
two
babies
getting
eye
babies
to
get
up
for
in
the
babies
to
carry
about
and
wash
their
little
piggy
clothes
she
looked
with
horror
at
the
one
in
her
arms
who
seeming
to
understand
the
contemptuous
loathing
of
her
tired
glance
doubled
his
fists
stiffened
his
body
and
began
violently
screaming
she
laid
him
on
the
settle
and
went
back
to
her
he
never
ceased
crying
for
a
moment
but
she
got
quite
used
to
it
and
kept
time
with
her
broom
oh
how
tired
she
was
oh
the
heavy
broom
handle
and
the
burning
spot
just
at
the
back
of
her
neck
that
ached
so
and
a
funny
little
fluttering
feeling
just
at
the
back
of
her
waistband
as
though
something
were
going
to
break
the
clock
struck
six
she
set
the
pan
of
milk
in
the
oven
and
went
into
the
next
room
to
wake
and
dress
the
three
children
anton
and
hans
lay
together
in
attitudes
of
mutual
amity
which
certainly
never
existed
out
of
their
sleeping
hours
lena
was
curled
up
her
knees
under
her
chin
only
a
straight
pigtail
of
hair
showing
above
the
bolster
get
up
cried
the
child
speaking
in
a
voice
of
immense
authority
pulling
off
the
bedclothes
and
giving
the
boys
sundry
pokes
and
digs
i
ve
been
calling
you
this
last
it
s
late
and
i
ll
tell
on
you
if
you
don
t
get
dressed
this
anton
awoke
sufficiently
to
turn
over
and
kick
hans
on
a
tender
part
whereupon
hans
pulled
lena
s
pigtail
until
she
shrieked
for
her
mother
oh
do
be
quiet
whispered
the
child
oh
do
get
up
and
dress
you
know
what
will
happen
ll
help
but
the
warning
came
too
late
the
frau
got
out
of
bed
walked
in
a
determined
fashion
into
the
kitchen
returning
with
a
bundle
of
twigs
in
her
hand
fastened
together
with
a
strong
cord
one
by
one
she
laid
the
children
across
her
knee
and
severely
beat
them
expending
a
final
burst
of
energy
on
the
then
returned
to
bed
with
a
comfortable
sense
of
her
maternal
duties
in
good
working
order
for
the
day
very
subdued
the
three
allowed
themselves
to
be
dressed
and
washed
by
the
child
who
even
laced
the
boys
boots
having
found
through
experience
that
if
left
to
themselves
they
hopped
about
for
at
least
five
minutes
to
find
a
comfortable
ledge
for
their
foot
and
then
spat
on
their
hands
and
broke
the
bootlaces
while
she
gave
them
their
breakfast
they
became
uproarious
and
the
baby
would
not
cease
crying
when
she
filled
the
tin
kettle
with
milk
tied
on
the
rubber
teat
and
first
moistening
it
herself
tried
with
little
coaxing
words
to
make
him
drink
he
threw
the
bottle
on
to
the
floor
and
trembled
all
over
eye
teeth
shouted
hans
hitting
anton
over
the
head
with
his
empty
cup
he
s
getting
the
teeth
i
should
smarty
retorted
lena
poking
out
her
tongue
at
him
and
then
when
he
promptly
did
the
same
crying
at
the
top
of
her
voice
mother
hans
is
making
faces
at
me
that
s
right
said
hans
go
on
howling
and
when
you
re
in
bed
i
ll
wait
till
you
re
asleep
and
then
i
ll
creep
over
and
take
a
little
tiny
piece
of
your
arm
and
twist
and
twist
it
he
leant
over
the
table
making
the
most
horrible
faces
at
lena
not
noticing
that
anton
was
standing
behind
his
chair
until
the
little
boy
bent
over
and
spat
on
his
brother
s
shaven
head
oh
weh
oh
weh
the
pushed
and
pulled
them
apart
muffled
them
into
their
coats
and
drove
them
out
of
the
house
hurry
hurry
the
second
bell
s
rung
she
urged
knowing
perfectly
well
she
was
telling
a
story
and
rather
exulting
in
the
fact
she
washed
up
the
breakfast
things
then
went
down
to
the
cellar
to
look
out
the
potatoes
and
beetroot
such
a
funny
cold
place
the
coal
cellar
with
potatoes
banked
on
one
corner
beetroot
in
an
old
candle
box
two
tubs
of
sauerkraut
and
a
twisted
mass
of
dahlia
looked
as
real
as
though
they
were
fighting
one
another
thought
the
child
she
gathered
the
potatoes
into
her
skirt
choosing
big
ones
with
few
eyes
because
they
were
easier
to
peel
and
bending
over
the
dull
heap
in
the
silent
cellar
she
began
to
nod
here
you
what
are
you
doing
down
there
cried
the
frau
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
the
baby
s
fallen
off
the
settle
and
got
a
bump
as
big
as
an
egg
over
his
eye
come
up
here
and
i
ll
teach
you
it
wasn
t
wasn
t
me
screamed
the
child
beaten
from
one
side
of
the
hall
to
the
other
so
that
the
potatoes
and
beetroot
rolled
out
of
her
skirt
the
frau
seemed
to
be
as
big
as
a
giant
and
there
was
a
certain
heaviness
in
all
her
movements
that
was
terrifying
to
anyone
so
small
sit
in
the
corner
and
peel
and
wash
the
vegetables
and
keep
the
baby
quiet
while
i
do
the
whimpering
she
obeyed
but
as
to
keeping
the
baby
quiet
that
was
impossible
his
face
was
hot
little
beads
of
sweat
stood
all
over
his
head
and
he
stiffened
his
body
and
cried
she
held
him
on
her
knees
with
a
pan
of
cold
water
beside
her
for
the
cleaned
vegetables
and
the
ducks
bucket
for
the
peelings
she
crooned
scraping
and
boring
there
s
going
to
be
another
soon
and
you
can
t
both
keep
on
crying
why
don
t
you
go
to
sleep
baby
i
would
if
i
were
you
i
ll
tell
you
a
dream
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
little
white
she
shook
back
her
head
a
great
lump
ached
in
her
throat
and
then
the
tears
ran
down
her
face
on
to
the
vegetables
that
s
no
good
said
the
child
shaking
them
away
just
stop
crying
until
i
ve
finished
this
baby
and
i
ll
walk
you
up
and
but
by
that
time
she
had
to
peg
out
the
washing
for
the
frau
a
wind
had
sprung
up
standing
on
tiptoe
in
the
yard
she
almost
felt
she
would
be
blown
away
there
was
a
bad
smell
coming
from
the
ducks
coop
which
was
half
full
of
manure
water
but
away
in
the
meadow
she
saw
the
grass
blowing
like
little
green
hairs
and
she
remembered
having
heard
of
a
child
who
had
once
played
for
a
whole
day
in
just
such
a
meadow
with
real
sausages
and
beer
for
her
not
a
little
bit
of
tiredness
who
had
told
her
that
story
she
could
not
remember
and
yet
it
was
so
plain
the
wet
clothes
flapped
in
her
face
as
she
pegged
them
danced
and
jigged
on
the
line
bulged
out
and
twisted
she
walked
back
to
the
house
with
lagging
steps
looking
longingly
at
the
grass
in
the
meadow
what
must
i
do
now
please
she
said
make
the
beds
and
hang
the
baby
s
mattress
out
of
the
window
then
get
the
wagon
and
take
him
for
a
little
walk
along
the
road
in
front
of
the
house
i
can
see
you
don
t
stand
there
gaping
then
come
in
when
i
call
you
and
help
me
cut
up
the
when
she
had
made
the
beds
the
child
stood
and
looked
at
them
gently
she
stroked
the
pillow
with
her
hand
and
then
just
for
one
moment
let
her
head
rest
there
again
the
smarting
lump
in
her
throat
the
stupid
tears
that
fell
and
kept
on
falling
as
she
dressed
the
baby
and
dragged
the
little
wagon
up
and
down
the
road
a
man
passed
driving
a
bullock
wagon
he
wore
a
long
queer
feather
in
his
hat
and
whistled
as
he
passed
two
girls
with
bundles
on
their
shoulders
came
walking
out
of
the
wore
a
red
handkerchief
about
her
head
and
one
a
blue
they
were
laughing
and
holding
each
other
by
the
hand
then
the
sun
pushed
by
a
heavy
fold
of
grey
cloud
and
spread
a
warm
yellow
light
over
everything
perhaps
thought
the
if
i
walked
far
enough
up
this
road
i
might
come
to
a
little
white
one
with
tall
black
trees
on
either
little
salad
salad
cried
the
frau
s
voice
from
the
house
soon
the
children
came
home
from
school
dinner
was
eaten
the
man
took
the
frau
s
share
of
pudding
as
well
as
his
own
and
the
three
children
seemed
to
smear
themselves
all
over
with
whatever
they
ate
then
more
and
more
cleaning
and
so
the
afternoon
dragged
coldly
through
old
frau
grathwohl
came
in
with
a
fresh
piece
of
pig
s
flesh
for
the
frau
and
the
child
listened
to
them
gossiping
together
frau
manda
went
on
her
journey
to
rome
last
night
and
brought
back
a
daughter
how
are
you
feeling
i
was
sick
twice
this
morning
said
the
frau
my
insides
are
all
twisted
up
with
having
children
too
i
see
you
ve
got
a
new
help
commented
old
mother
grathwohl
oh
dear
lord
frau
lowered
her
don
t
you
know
her
she
s
the
of
the
waitress
at
the
railway
station
they
found
her
mother
trying
to
squeeze
her
head
in
the
jug
and
the
child
s
half
whispered
the
one
to
the
baby
as
the
day
drew
in
the
did
not
know
how
to
fight
her
sleepiness
any
longer
she
was
afraid
to
sit
down
or
stand
still
as
she
sat
at
supper
the
man
and
the
frau
seemed
to
swell
to
an
immense
size
as
she
watched
them
and
then
become
smaller
than
dolls
with
little
voices
that
seemed
to
come
from
outside
the
window
looking
at
the
baby
it
suddenly
had
two
heads
and
then
no
head
even
his
crying
made
her
feel
worse
when
she
thought
of
the
nearness
of
bedtime
she
shook
all
over
with
excited
joy
but
as
eight
o
clock
approached
there
was
the
sound
of
wheels
on
the
road
and
presently
in
came
a
party
of
friends
to
spend
the
evening
then
it
was
put
on
the
bring
me
the
sugar
carry
the
chairs
out
of
the
set
the
and
finally
the
frau
sent
her
into
the
next
room
to
keep
the
baby
quiet
there
was
a
little
piece
of
candle
burning
in
the
enamel
bracket
as
she
walked
up
and
down
she
saw
her
great
big
shadow
on
the
wall
like
a
person
with
a
baby
whatever
would
it
look
like
when
she
carried
two
babies
so
once
upon
a
time
she
was
walking
along
a
little
white
road
with
oh
such
great
big
black
trees
on
either
here
you
called
the
frau
s
voice
bring
me
my
new
jacket
from
behind
the
and
as
she
took
it
into
the
warm
room
one
of
the
women
said
she
looks
like
an
owl
such
children
are
seldom
right
in
their
why
don
t
you
keep
that
baby
quiet
said
the
man
who
had
just
drunk
enough
beer
to
make
him
feel
very
brave
and
master
of
his
house
if
you
don
t
keep
that
baby
quiet
you
ll
know
why
later
they
burst
out
laughing
as
she
stumbled
back
into
the
bedroom
i
don
t
believe
holy
mary
could
keep
him
quiet
she
murmured
did
jesus
cry
like
this
when
he
was
little
if
i
was
not
so
tired
perhaps
i
could
do
it
but
the
baby
just
knows
that
i
want
to
go
to
sleep
and
there
is
going
to
be
another
she
flung
the
baby
on
the
bed
and
stood
looking
at
him
with
terror
from
the
next
room
there
came
the
jingle
of
glasses
and
the
warm
sound
of
laughter
and
she
suddenly
had
a
beautiful
marvellous
idea
she
laughed
for
the
first
time
that
day
and
clapped
her
hands
she
said
lie
there
silly
one
you
will
go
to
sleep
you
ll
not
cry
any
more
or
wake
up
in
the
night
funny
little
ugly
he
opened
his
eyes
and
shrieked
loudly
at
the
sight
of
the
from
the
next
room
she
heard
the
frau
call
out
to
her
one
is
almost
asleep
she
cried
and
then
gently
smiling
on
tiptoe
she
brought
the
pink
bolster
from
the
frau
s
bed
and
covered
the
baby
s
face
with
it
pressed
with
all
her
might
as
he
struggled
like
a
duck
with
its
head
off
wriggling
she
thought
she
heaved
a
long
sigh
then
fell
back
on
to
the
floor
and
was
walking
along
a
little
white
road
with
tall
black
trees
on
either
side
a
little
road
that
led
to
nowhere
and
where
nobody
walked
at
at
all
the
advanced
lady
do
you
think
we
might
ask
her
to
come
with
us
said
fräulein
elsa
retying
her
pink
sash
ribbon
before
my
mirror
you
know
although
she
is
so
intellectual
i
can
not
help
feeling
convinced
that
she
has
some
secret
sorrow
and
lisa
told
me
this
morning
as
she
was
turning
out
my
room
that
she
remains
hours
and
hours
by
herself
writing
in
fact
lisa
says
she
is
writing
a
book
i
suppose
that
is
why
she
never
cares
to
mingle
with
us
and
has
so
little
time
for
her
husband
and
the
well
you
ask
her
said
i
i
have
never
spoken
to
the
elsa
blushed
faintly
i
have
only
spoken
to
her
once
she
confessed
i
took
her
a
bunch
of
wild
flowers
to
her
room
and
she
came
to
the
door
in
a
white
gown
with
her
hair
loose
never
shall
i
forget
that
moment
she
just
took
the
flowers
and
i
heard
the
door
was
not
quite
properly
heard
her
as
i
walked
down
the
passage
saying
purity
fragrance
the
fragrance
of
purity
and
the
purity
of
fragrance
it
was
wonderful
at
that
moment
frau
kellermann
knocked
at
the
door
are
you
ready
she
said
coming
into
the
room
and
nodding
to
us
very
genially
the
gentlemen
are
waiting
on
the
steps
and
i
have
asked
the
advanced
lady
to
come
with
na
how
extraordinary
cried
elsa
but
this
moment
the
gnädige
frau
and
i
were
debating
yes
i
met
her
coming
out
of
her
room
and
she
said
she
was
charmed
with
the
idea
like
all
of
us
she
has
never
been
to
schlingen
she
is
downstairs
now
talking
to
herr
erchardt
i
think
we
shall
have
a
delightful
is
fritzi
waiting
too
asked
elsa
of
course
he
is
dear
impatient
as
a
hungry
man
listening
for
the
dinner
bell
run
along
elsa
ran
and
frau
kellermann
smiled
at
me
significantly
in
the
past
she
and
i
had
seldom
spoken
to
each
other
owing
to
the
fact
that
her
one
remaining
joy
charming
little
never
succeeded
in
kindling
into
flame
those
sparks
of
maternity
which
are
supposed
to
glow
in
great
numbers
upon
the
altar
of
every
respectable
female
heart
but
in
view
of
a
premeditated
journey
together
we
became
delightfully
cordial
for
us
she
said
there
will
be
a
double
joy
we
shall
be
able
to
watch
the
happiness
of
these
two
dear
children
elsa
and
fritz
they
only
received
the
letters
of
blessing
from
their
parents
yesterday
morning
it
is
a
very
strange
thing
but
whenever
i
am
in
the
company
of
couples
i
blossom
couples
mothers
with
first
babies
and
normal
deathbeds
have
precisely
the
same
effect
on
me
shall
we
join
the
others
i
was
longing
to
ask
her
why
normal
deathbeds
should
cause
anyone
to
burst
into
flower
and
said
yes
do
let
we
were
greeted
by
the
little
party
of
cure
guests
on
the
pension
steps
with
those
cries
of
joy
and
excitement
which
herald
so
pleasantly
the
mildest
german
excursion
herr
erchardt
and
i
had
not
met
before
that
day
so
in
accordance
with
strict
pension
custom
we
asked
each
other
how
long
we
had
slept
during
the
night
had
we
dreamed
agreeably
what
time
we
had
got
up
was
the
coffee
fresh
when
we
had
appeared
at
breakfast
and
how
had
we
passed
the
morning
having
toiled
up
these
stairs
of
almost
national
politeness
we
landed
triumphant
and
smiling
and
paused
to
recover
breath
and
now
said
herr
erchardt
i
have
a
pleasure
in
store
for
you
the
frau
professor
is
going
to
be
one
of
us
for
the
afternoon
yes
nodding
graciously
to
the
advanced
lady
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
each
we
bowed
very
formally
and
looked
each
other
over
with
that
eye
which
is
known
as
eagle
but
is
far
more
the
property
of
the
female
than
that
most
unoffending
of
birds
i
think
you
are
english
she
said
i
acknowledged
the
fact
i
am
reading
a
great
many
english
books
just
i
am
studying
nu
cried
herr
erchardt
fancy
that
what
a
bond
already
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
know
shakespeare
in
his
mother
tongue
before
i
die
but
that
you
frau
professor
should
be
already
immersed
in
those
wells
of
english
thought
from
what
i
have
read
she
said
i
do
not
think
they
are
very
deep
he
nodded
sympathetically
no
he
answered
so
i
have
heard
but
do
not
let
us
embitter
our
excursion
for
our
little
english
friend
we
will
speak
of
this
another
nu
are
we
ready
cried
fritz
who
stood
supporting
elsa
s
elbow
in
his
hand
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
it
was
immediately
discovered
that
karl
was
lost
we
cried
no
response
but
he
was
here
one
moment
ago
said
herr
langen
a
tired
pale
youth
who
was
recovering
from
a
nervous
breakdown
due
to
much
philosophy
and
little
nourishment
he
was
sitting
here
picking
out
the
works
of
his
watch
with
a
hairpin
frau
kellermann
rounded
on
him
do
you
mean
to
say
my
dear
herr
langen
you
did
not
stop
the
child
no
said
herr
langen
i
ve
tried
stopping
him
before
da
that
child
has
such
energy
never
is
his
brain
at
peace
if
he
is
not
doing
one
thing
he
is
doing
another
perhaps
he
has
started
on
the
clock
now
suggested
herr
langen
abominably
hopeful
the
advanced
lady
suggested
that
we
should
go
without
him
i
never
take
my
little
daughter
for
walks
she
said
i
have
accustomed
her
to
sitting
quietly
in
my
bedroom
from
the
time
i
go
out
until
i
return
there
he
he
is
piped
elsa
and
karl
was
observed
slithering
down
a
very
much
the
worse
for
twigs
i
ve
been
listening
to
what
you
said
about
me
mumma
he
confessed
while
frau
kellermann
brushed
him
down
it
was
not
true
about
the
watch
i
was
only
looking
at
it
and
the
little
girl
never
stays
in
the
bedroom
she
told
me
herself
she
always
goes
down
to
the
kitchen
da
that
s
enough
said
frau
kellermann
we
marched
en
masse
along
the
station
road
it
was
a
very
warm
afternoon
and
continuous
parties
of
cure
guests
who
were
giving
their
digestions
a
quiet
airing
in
pension
gardens
called
after
us
asked
if
we
were
going
for
a
walk
and
cried
herr
journey
with
immense
relish
when
we
mentioned
schlingen
but
that
is
eight
kilometres
shouted
one
old
man
with
a
white
beard
who
leaned
against
a
fence
fanning
himself
with
a
yellow
handkerchief
seven
and
a
half
answered
herr
erchardt
shortly
eight
bellowed
the
sage
seven
and
a
half
eight
the
man
is
mad
said
herr
erchardt
well
please
let
him
be
mad
in
peace
said
i
putting
my
hands
over
my
ears
such
ignorance
must
not
be
allowed
to
go
uncontradicted
said
he
and
turning
his
back
on
us
too
exhausted
to
cry
out
any
longer
he
held
up
seven
and
a
half
fingers
eight
thundered
the
greybeard
with
pristine
freshness
we
felt
very
sobered
and
did
not
recover
until
we
reached
a
white
signpost
which
entreated
us
to
leave
the
road
and
walk
through
the
field
trampling
down
more
of
the
grass
than
was
necessary
being
interpreted
it
meant
single
file
which
was
distressing
for
elsa
and
fritz
karl
like
a
happy
child
gambolled
ahead
and
cut
down
as
many
flowers
as
possible
with
the
stick
of
his
mother
s
the
three
the
lovers
in
the
rear
and
above
the
conversation
of
the
advance
party
i
had
the
privilege
of
hearing
these
delicious
whispers
fritz
do
you
love
me
elsa
fritz
passionately
but
how
much
to
which
elsa
never
with
how
much
do
you
love
me
fritz
escaped
that
truly
christian
trap
by
saying
i
asked
you
it
grew
so
confusing
that
i
slipped
in
front
of
frau
walked
in
the
peaceful
knowledge
that
she
was
blossoming
and
i
was
under
no
obligation
to
inform
even
my
nearest
and
dearest
as
to
the
precise
capacity
of
my
affections
what
right
have
they
to
ask
each
other
such
questions
the
day
after
letters
of
blessing
have
been
received
i
reflected
what
right
have
they
even
to
question
each
other
love
which
becomes
engaged
and
married
is
a
purely
affirmative
are
usurping
the
privileges
of
their
betters
and
wisers
the
edges
of
the
field
frilled
over
into
an
immense
pine
pleasant
and
cool
it
looked
another
signpost
begged
us
to
keep
to
the
broad
path
for
schlingen
and
deposit
waste
paper
and
fruit
peelings
in
wire
receptacles
attached
to
the
benches
for
the
purpose
we
sat
down
on
the
first
bench
and
karl
with
great
curiosity
explored
the
wire
receptacle
i
love
woods
said
the
advanced
lady
smiling
pitifully
into
the
air
in
a
wood
my
hair
already
seems
to
stir
and
remember
something
of
its
savage
but
speaking
literally
said
frau
kellermann
after
an
appreciative
pause
there
is
really
nothing
better
than
the
air
of
for
the
oh
frau
kellermann
please
don
t
break
the
spell
said
elsa
the
advanced
lady
looked
at
her
very
sympathetically
have
you
too
found
the
magic
heart
of
nature
she
said
that
was
herr
langen
s
cue
nature
has
no
heart
said
he
very
bitterly
and
readily
as
people
do
who
are
and
underfed
she
creates
that
she
may
destroy
she
eats
that
she
may
spew
up
and
she
spews
up
that
she
may
eat
that
is
why
we
who
are
forced
to
eke
out
an
existence
at
her
trampling
feet
consider
the
world
mad
and
realise
the
deadly
vulgarity
of
young
man
interrupted
herr
erchardt
you
have
never
lived
and
you
have
never
suffered
oh
excuse
can
you
know
i
know
because
you
have
told
me
and
there
s
an
end
of
it
come
back
to
this
bench
in
ten
years
time
and
repeat
those
words
to
me
said
frau
kellermann
with
an
eye
upon
fritz
who
was
engaged
in
counting
elsa
s
fingers
with
passionate
and
bring
with
you
your
young
wife
herr
langen
and
watch
perhaps
your
little
child
playing
she
turned
towards
karl
who
had
rooted
an
old
illustrated
paper
out
of
the
receptacle
and
was
spelling
over
an
advertisement
for
the
enlargement
of
beautiful
breasts
the
sentence
remained
unfinished
we
decided
to
move
on
as
we
plunged
more
deeply
into
the
wood
our
spirits
a
point
where
they
burst
into
the
part
of
the
three
o
welt
wie
bist
du
wunderbar
lower
part
of
which
was
piercingly
sustained
by
herr
langen
who
attempted
quite
unsuccessfully
to
infuse
satire
into
it
in
accordance
with
world
outlook
they
strode
ahead
and
left
us
to
trail
after
and
happy
now
is
the
opportunity
said
frau
kellermann
dear
frau
professor
do
tell
us
a
little
about
your
ach
how
did
you
know
i
was
writing
one
she
cried
playfully
elsa
here
had
it
from
lisa
and
never
before
have
i
personally
known
a
woman
who
was
writing
a
book
how
do
you
manage
to
find
enough
to
write
down
that
is
never
the
trouble
said
the
advanced
took
elsa
s
arm
and
leaned
on
it
gently
the
trouble
is
to
know
where
to
stop
my
brain
has
been
a
hive
for
years
and
about
three
months
ago
the
waters
burst
over
my
soul
and
since
then
i
am
writing
all
day
until
late
into
the
night
still
ever
finding
fresh
inspirations
and
thoughts
which
beat
impatient
wings
about
my
is
it
a
novel
asked
elsa
shyly
of
course
it
is
a
novel
said
i
how
can
you
be
so
positive
said
frau
kellermann
eyeing
me
severely
because
nothing
but
a
novel
could
produce
an
effect
like
ach
don
t
quarrel
said
the
advanced
lady
sweetly
yes
it
is
a
the
modern
woman
for
this
seems
to
me
the
woman
s
hour
it
is
mysterious
and
almost
prophetic
it
is
the
symbol
of
the
true
advanced
woman
not
one
of
those
violent
creatures
who
deny
their
sex
and
smother
their
frail
wings
under
the
english
from
frau
kellermann
i
was
not
going
to
put
it
like
that
rather
under
the
lying
garb
of
false
masculinity
such
a
subtle
distinction
i
murmured
whom
then
asked
fräulein
elsa
looking
adoringly
at
the
advanced
whom
then
do
you
consider
the
true
woman
she
is
the
incarnation
of
comprehending
love
but
my
dear
frau
professor
protested
frau
kellermann
you
must
remember
that
one
has
so
few
opportunities
for
exhibiting
love
within
the
family
circle
nowadays
one
s
husband
is
at
business
all
day
and
naturally
desires
to
sleep
when
he
returns
s
children
are
out
of
the
lap
and
in
at
the
university
before
one
can
lavish
anything
at
all
upon
them
but
love
is
not
a
question
of
lavishing
said
the
advanced
lady
it
is
the
lamp
carried
in
the
bosom
touching
with
serene
rays
all
the
heights
and
depths
darkest
africa
i
murmured
flippantly
she
did
not
hear
the
mistake
we
have
made
in
the
a
sex
said
she
is
in
not
realising
that
our
gifts
of
giving
are
for
the
whole
are
the
glad
sacrifice
of
ourselves
oh
cried
elsa
rapturously
and
almost
bursting
into
gifts
as
she
how
i
know
that
you
know
ever
since
fritz
and
i
have
been
engaged
i
share
the
desire
to
give
to
everybody
to
share
everything
how
extremely
dangerous
said
i
it
is
only
the
beauty
of
danger
or
the
danger
of
beauty
said
the
advanced
and
there
you
have
the
ideal
of
my
woman
is
nothing
but
a
i
smiled
at
her
very
sweetly
do
you
know
i
said
i
too
would
like
to
write
a
book
on
the
advisability
of
caring
for
daughters
and
taking
them
for
airings
and
keeping
them
out
of
kitchens
i
think
the
masculine
element
must
have
felt
these
angry
vibrations
they
ceased
from
singing
and
together
we
climbed
out
of
the
wood
to
see
schlingen
below
us
tucked
in
a
circle
of
hills
the
white
houses
shining
in
the
sunlight
for
all
the
world
like
eggs
in
a
bird
s
nest
as
herr
erchardt
declared
we
descended
upon
schlingen
and
demanded
sour
milk
with
fresh
cream
and
bread
at
the
inn
of
the
golden
stag
a
most
friendly
place
with
tables
in
a
where
hens
and
chickens
ran
flopping
upon
the
disused
tables
and
pecking
at
the
red
checks
on
the
cloths
we
broke
the
bread
into
the
bowls
added
the
cream
and
stirred
it
round
with
flat
wooden
spoons
the
landlord
and
his
wife
standing
by
splendid
weather
said
herr
erchardt
waving
his
spoon
at
the
landlord
who
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
you
don
t
call
it
splendid
as
you
please
said
the
landlord
obviously
scorning
us
such
a
beautiful
walk
said
fräulein
elsa
making
a
free
gift
of
her
most
charming
smile
to
the
landlady
i
never
walk
said
the
landlady
when
i
go
to
mindelbau
my
man
drives
ve
more
important
things
to
do
with
my
legs
than
walk
them
through
the
dust
i
like
these
people
confessed
herr
langen
to
me
i
like
them
very
very
much
i
think
i
shall
take
a
room
here
for
the
whole
why
oh
because
they
live
close
to
the
earth
and
therefore
despise
he
pushed
away
his
bowl
of
sour
milk
and
lit
a
cigarette
we
ate
solidly
and
seriously
until
those
seven
and
a
half
kilometres
to
mindelbau
stretched
before
us
like
an
eternity
even
karl
s
activity
became
so
full
fed
that
he
lay
on
the
ground
and
removed
his
leather
waistbelt
elsa
suddenly
leaned
over
to
fritz
and
whispered
who
on
hearing
her
to
the
end
and
asking
her
if
she
loved
him
got
up
and
made
a
little
speech
wish
to
celebrate
our
betrothal
you
all
to
drive
back
with
us
in
the
landlord
s
will
hold
us
oh
what
a
beautiful
noble
idea
said
frau
kellermann
heaving
a
sigh
of
relief
that
audibly
burst
two
hooks
it
is
my
little
gift
said
elsa
to
the
advanced
lady
who
by
virtue
of
three
portions
almost
wept
tears
of
gratitude
squeezed
into
the
peasant
cart
and
driven
by
the
landlord
who
showed
his
contempt
for
mother
earth
by
spitting
savagely
every
now
and
again
we
jolted
home
again
and
the
nearer
we
came
to
mindelbau
the
more
we
loved
it
and
one
another
we
must
have
many
excursions
like
this
said
herr
erchardt
to
me
for
one
surely
gets
to
know
a
person
in
the
simple
surroundings
of
the
open
shares
the
same
feels
friendship
what
is
it
your
shakespeare
says
one
moment
i
have
it
the
friends
thou
hast
and
their
adoption
them
to
thy
soul
with
hoops
of
steel
but
said
i
feeling
very
friendly
towards
him
the
bother
about
my
soul
is
that
it
refuses
to
grapple
anybody
at
i
am
sure
that
the
dead
weight
of
a
friend
whose
adoption
it
had
tried
would
kill
it
immediately
never
yet
has
it
shown
the
slightest
sign
of
a
hoop
he
bumped
against
my
knees
and
excused
himself
and
the
cart
my
dear
little
lady
you
must
not
take
the
quotation
literally
naturally
one
is
not
physically
conscious
of
the
hoops
but
hoops
there
are
in
the
soul
of
him
or
her
who
loves
his
take
this
afternoon
for
instance
how
did
we
start
out
as
strangers
you
might
almost
say
and
of
have
we
come
home
in
a
cart
said
the
only
remaining
joy
who
sat
upon
his
mother
s
lap
and
felt
sick
we
skirted
the
field
that
we
had
passed
through
going
round
by
the
cemetery
herr
langen
leaned
over
the
edge
of
the
seat
and
greeted
the
graves
he
was
sitting
next
to
the
advanced
the
shelter
of
her
shoulder
i
heard
her
murmur
you
look
like
a
little
boy
with
your
hair
blowing
about
in
the
herr
langen
slightly
less
the
last
graves
disappear
and
i
heard
her
murmur
why
are
you
so
sad
i
too
am
very
sad
look
young
enough
for
me
to
dare
to
say
of
much
joy
what
do
you
know
said
he
i
leaned
over
and
touched
the
advanced
lady
s
hand
hasn
t
it
been
a
nice
afternoon
i
said
questioningly
but
you
know
that
theory
of
yours
about
women
and
s
as
old
as
the
older
from
the
road
a
sudden
shout
of
triumph
yes
there
he
was
beard
silk
handkerchief
and
undaunted
enthusiasm
what
did
i
say
eight
is
seven
and
a
half
shrieked
herr
erchardt
why
then
do
you
return
in
carts
eight
kilometres
it
must
herr
erchardt
made
a
cup
of
his
hands
and
stood
up
in
the
jolting
cart
while
frau
kellermann
clung
to
his
knees
seven
and
a
half
ignorance
must
not
go
uncontradicted
i
said
to
the
advanced
lady
the
swing
of
the
pendulum
the
landlady
knocked
at
the
door
come
in
said
viola
there
is
a
letter
for
you
said
the
landlady
a
special
letter
held
the
green
envelope
in
a
corner
of
her
dingy
apron
viola
kneeling
on
the
floor
poking
at
the
little
dusty
stove
stretched
out
her
hand
any
answer
no
the
messenger
has
oh
all
right
she
did
not
look
the
landlady
in
the
face
she
was
ashamed
of
not
having
paid
her
rent
and
wondered
grimly
without
any
hope
if
the
woman
would
begin
to
bluster
again
about
this
money
owing
to
said
the
landlady
oh
the
she
goes
thought
viola
turning
her
back
on
the
woman
and
making
a
grimace
at
the
stove
it
s
it
s
go
the
landlady
raised
her
voice
she
began
to
bawl
i
m
a
landlady
i
am
and
a
respectable
woman
i
ll
have
you
know
i
ll
have
no
lice
in
my
house
sneaking
their
way
into
the
furniture
and
eating
up
everything
it
s
out
you
go
before
twelve
o
clock
viola
felt
rather
than
saw
the
woman
s
gesture
she
shot
out
her
arm
in
a
stupid
helpless
way
as
though
a
dirty
pigeon
had
suddenly
flown
at
her
face
filthy
old
beast
ugh
and
the
smell
of
stale
cheese
and
damp
very
well
she
answered
shortly
it
s
cash
down
or
i
leave
all
right
don
t
it
was
before
this
woman
came
near
her
she
trembled
in
her
the
sound
of
those
flat
feet
stumping
up
the
stairs
made
her
feel
sick
but
once
they
were
face
to
face
she
felt
immensely
calm
and
indifferent
and
could
not
understand
why
she
even
worried
about
money
nor
why
she
sneaked
out
of
the
house
on
tiptoe
not
even
daring
to
shut
the
door
after
her
in
case
the
landlady
should
hear
and
shout
something
terrible
nor
why
she
spent
nights
pacing
up
and
down
her
up
sharply
before
the
mirror
and
saying
to
a
tragic
reflection
money
money
money
when
she
was
alone
her
poverty
was
like
a
huge
on
which
her
feet
were
fast
with
the
ache
of
the
size
of
the
if
it
came
to
definite
action
with
no
time
for
imaginings
her
dwindled
into
a
beastly
affair
to
be
passed
as
quickly
as
possible
with
anger
and
a
strong
sense
of
superiority
the
landlady
bounced
out
of
the
room
banging
the
door
so
that
it
shook
and
rattled
as
though
it
had
listened
to
the
conversation
and
fully
sympathised
with
the
old
hag
squatting
on
her
heels
viola
opened
the
letter
it
was
from
casimir
i
shall
be
with
you
at
three
o
clock
this
must
be
off
again
this
evening
all
news
when
we
meet
i
hope
you
are
happier
than
huh
how
kind
she
sneered
how
condescending
too
good
of
you
really
she
sprang
to
her
feet
crumbling
the
letter
in
her
hands
and
how
are
you
to
know
that
i
shall
stick
here
awaiting
your
pleasure
until
three
o
clock
this
afternoon
but
she
knew
she
would
her
rage
was
only
half
sincere
she
longed
to
see
casimir
for
she
was
confident
that
this
time
she
would
make
him
understand
the
situation
for
as
it
is
it
s
she
muttered
it
was
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
of
a
grey
day
curiously
lighted
by
pale
flashes
of
sunshine
searched
by
these
flashes
her
room
looked
tumbled
and
grimed
she
pulled
down
the
they
gave
a
persistent
whitish
glare
which
was
just
as
bad
the
only
thing
of
life
in
the
room
was
a
jar
of
hyacinths
given
her
by
the
landlady
s
daughter
it
stood
on
the
table
exuding
a
sickly
perfume
from
its
plump
petals
there
were
even
rich
buds
unfolding
and
the
leaves
shone
like
oil
viola
went
over
to
the
washstand
poured
some
water
into
the
enamel
basin
and
sponged
her
face
and
neck
she
dipped
her
face
into
the
water
opened
her
eyes
and
shook
her
head
from
side
to
was
exhilarating
she
did
it
three
times
i
suppose
i
could
drown
myself
if
i
stayed
under
long
enough
she
thought
i
wonder
how
long
it
takes
to
become
unconscious
often
read
of
women
drowning
in
a
bucket
i
wonder
if
any
air
enters
by
the
the
basin
would
have
to
be
as
deep
as
a
bucket
she
the
washstand
with
both
hands
and
slowly
sank
her
head
into
the
water
when
again
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
not
the
landlady
this
must
be
casimir
with
her
face
and
hair
dripping
with
her
petticoat
bodice
unbuttoned
she
ran
and
opened
it
a
strange
man
stood
against
the
her
he
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
and
smiled
delightfully
excuse
fräulein
schäfer
live
here
no
never
heard
of
his
smile
was
so
infectious
she
wanted
to
smile
the
water
had
made
her
feel
so
fresh
and
rosy
the
strange
man
appeared
overwhelmed
with
astonishment
she
doesn
t
he
cried
she
is
out
you
mean
no
she
s
not
living
here
answered
viola
he
moved
from
the
door
lintel
standing
squarely
in
front
of
her
he
unbuttoned
his
greatcoat
and
drew
a
slip
of
paper
from
the
breast
pocket
smoothing
it
in
his
gloved
fingers
before
handing
it
to
her
yes
that
s
the
address
right
enough
but
there
must
be
a
mistake
in
the
number
so
many
in
this
street
you
know
and
so
drops
of
water
fell
from
her
hair
on
to
the
paper
she
burst
out
laughing
oh
how
dreadful
i
must
moment
she
ran
back
to
the
washstand
and
caught
up
a
towel
the
door
was
still
open
after
all
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
why
on
earth
had
she
asked
him
to
wait
a
moment
she
folded
the
towel
round
her
shoulders
and
returned
to
the
door
suddenly
grave
i
m
sorry
i
know
no
such
name
in
a
sharp
voice
said
the
strange
man
sorry
too
have
you
been
living
here
long
long
she
began
to
close
the
door
slowly
thanks
so
much
hope
i
haven
t
been
a
she
heard
him
walk
down
the
passage
and
then
a
cigarette
faint
scent
of
delicious
cigarette
smoke
penetrated
her
room
she
sniffed
at
it
smiling
again
well
that
had
been
a
fascinating
interlude
he
looked
so
amazingly
happy
his
heavy
clothes
and
big
buttoned
gloves
his
beautifully
brushed
hair
and
that
smile
jolly
was
the
a
boy
with
the
world
for
his
playground
people
like
that
did
one
felt
made
over
at
the
sight
of
them
sane
they
sane
and
solid
you
could
depend
on
them
never
having
one
mad
impulse
from
the
day
they
were
born
until
the
day
they
died
and
life
was
in
league
with
them
on
her
rightly
too
at
that
moment
she
noticed
casimir
s
letter
crumpled
up
on
the
smile
faded
staring
at
the
letter
she
began
braiding
her
dull
feeling
of
rage
crept
through
seemed
to
be
braiding
it
into
her
brain
and
binding
it
tightly
above
her
head
of
course
that
had
been
the
mistake
all
along
what
had
oh
casimir
s
frightful
seriousness
if
she
had
been
happy
when
they
first
met
she
never
would
have
looked
at
they
had
been
like
two
patients
in
the
same
hospital
finding
comfort
in
the
sickness
of
the
foundation
for
a
love
episode
misfortune
had
knocked
their
heads
together
they
had
looked
at
each
other
stunned
with
the
conflict
and
sympathised
i
wish
i
could
step
outside
the
whole
affair
and
just
judge
i
d
find
a
way
out
i
certainly
was
in
love
with
casimir
oh
be
sincere
for
she
flopped
down
on
the
bed
and
hid
her
face
in
the
pillow
i
was
not
in
love
i
wanted
somebody
to
look
after
keep
me
until
my
work
began
to
he
kept
bothers
with
other
men
away
and
what
would
have
happened
if
he
hadn
t
come
along
i
would
have
spent
my
wretched
little
pittance
and
that
was
what
decided
me
thinking
about
that
he
was
the
only
solution
and
i
believed
in
him
then
i
thought
his
work
had
only
to
be
recognised
once
and
he
d
roll
in
wealth
i
thought
perhaps
we
might
be
poor
for
a
he
said
if
only
he
could
have
me
the
stimulus
funny
if
it
wasn
t
so
damned
tragic
exactly
the
contrary
has
hasn
t
had
a
thing
published
for
have
then
i
didn
t
expect
to
yes
the
truth
is
i
m
hard
and
bitter
and
i
have
neither
faith
nor
love
for
unsuccessful
men
i
always
end
by
despising
them
as
i
despise
casimir
i
suppose
it
s
the
savage
pride
of
the
female
who
likes
to
think
the
man
to
whom
she
has
given
herself
must
be
a
very
great
chief
indeed
but
to
stew
in
this
disgusting
house
while
casimir
scours
the
land
in
the
hope
of
finding
one
editorial
open
s
humiliating
it
s
changed
my
whole
nature
i
wasn
t
born
for
only
flower
among
really
jolly
people
and
people
who
never
are
the
figure
of
the
strange
man
rose
before
not
be
dismissed
that
was
the
man
for
me
after
all
is
said
and
man
without
a
d
give
me
everything
i
want
and
with
whom
i
d
always
feel
that
sense
of
life
and
of
being
in
touch
with
the
world
i
never
wanted
to
was
thrust
on
me
really
there
s
a
fount
of
happiness
in
me
that
is
drying
up
little
by
little
in
this
hateful
existence
i
ll
be
dead
if
this
goes
stirred
in
the
bed
and
flung
out
her
i
want
passion
and
love
and
yearn
for
them
why
should
i
stay
here
and
rot
am
rotting
she
cried
comforting
herself
with
the
sound
of
her
breaking
voice
but
if
i
tell
casimir
all
this
when
he
comes
this
afternoon
and
he
says
go
he
certainly
s
another
thing
i
loathe
about
s
under
my
should
i
do
should
i
go
to
there
was
nowhere
i
don
t
want
to
carve
out
my
own
path
i
want
ease
and
any
amount
of
nursing
in
the
lap
of
luxury
there
is
only
one
thing
i
m
fitted
for
and
that
is
to
be
a
great
but
she
did
not
know
how
to
go
about
it
she
was
frightened
to
go
into
the
heard
of
such
awful
things
happening
to
those
with
men
who
didn
t
the
idea
of
a
strange
man
every
that
was
out
of
the
question
if
i
d
the
clothes
i
would
go
to
a
really
good
hotel
and
find
some
wealthy
man
like
the
strange
man
this
morning
he
would
be
ideal
oh
if
i
only
had
his
am
sure
i
would
fascinate
him
i
d
keep
him
laughing
all
d
make
him
give
me
unlimited
money
at
the
thought
she
grew
warm
and
soft
she
began
to
dream
of
a
wonderful
house
and
of
presses
full
of
clothes
and
of
perfumes
she
saw
herself
stepping
into
at
the
strange
man
with
a
mysterious
voluptuous
practised
the
glance
lying
on
the
never
another
worry
just
drugged
with
happiness
that
was
the
life
for
her
well
the
thing
to
do
was
to
let
casimir
go
on
his
chase
that
evening
and
while
he
was
to
was
the
rent
to
be
paid
before
twelve
next
morning
and
she
hadn
t
the
money
for
a
square
meal
at
the
thought
of
food
she
felt
a
sharp
twinge
in
her
stomach
a
sensation
as
though
there
were
a
hand
in
her
stomach
squeezing
it
dry
she
was
terribly
casimir
s
that
man
had
lived
on
the
fat
of
the
land
ever
since
he
was
born
he
looked
as
though
he
could
order
a
magnificent
dinner
oh
why
hadn
t
she
played
her
cards
better
d
been
sent
by
she
d
snubbed
him
if
i
had
that
time
over
again
i
d
be
safe
by
and
instead
of
the
ordinary
man
who
had
spoken
with
her
at
the
door
her
mind
created
a
brilliant
laughing
image
who
would
treat
her
like
a
queen
there
s
only
one
thing
i
could
not
he
should
be
coarse
or
vulgar
well
he
wasn
was
obviously
a
man
of
the
world
and
the
way
he
apologised
i
have
enough
faith
in
my
own
power
and
beauty
to
know
i
could
make
a
man
treat
me
just
as
i
wanted
to
be
it
floated
into
her
sweet
scent
of
cigarette
smoke
and
then
she
remembered
that
she
had
heard
nobody
go
down
the
stone
stairs
was
it
possible
that
the
strange
man
was
still
there
the
thought
was
too
didn
t
play
tricks
like
was
quite
conscious
of
his
nearness
very
quietly
she
got
up
unhooked
from
the
back
of
the
door
a
long
white
gown
buttoned
it
slyly
she
did
not
know
what
was
going
to
happen
she
only
thought
oh
what
fun
and
that
they
were
playing
a
delicious
strange
man
and
she
very
gently
she
turned
the
screwing
up
her
face
and
biting
her
lip
as
the
lock
snapped
back
of
course
there
he
against
the
banister
rail
he
wheeled
round
as
she
slipped
into
the
passage
da
she
muttered
folding
her
gown
tightly
around
her
i
must
go
downstairs
and
fetch
some
wood
brr
the
cold
there
isn
t
any
wood
volunteered
the
strange
man
she
gave
a
little
cry
of
astonishment
and
then
tossed
her
head
you
again
she
said
scornfully
conscious
the
while
of
his
merry
eye
and
the
fresh
strong
smell
of
his
healthy
body
the
landlady
shouted
out
there
was
no
wood
left
i
just
saw
her
go
out
to
buy
she
longed
to
cry
he
came
quite
close
to
her
stood
over
her
and
whispered
aren
t
you
going
to
ask
me
to
finish
my
cigarette
in
your
room
she
nodded
you
may
if
you
want
to
in
that
moment
together
in
the
passage
a
miracle
had
happened
her
room
was
quite
was
full
of
sweet
light
and
the
scent
of
hyacinth
flowers
even
the
furniture
appeared
quick
as
a
flash
she
remembered
childish
parties
when
they
had
played
charades
and
one
side
had
left
the
room
and
come
in
again
to
act
a
what
she
was
doing
now
the
strange
man
went
over
to
the
stove
and
sat
down
in
her
she
did
not
want
him
to
talk
or
come
near
was
enough
to
see
him
in
the
room
so
secure
and
happy
how
hungry
she
had
been
for
the
nearness
of
someone
like
knew
nothing
at
all
about
made
no
just
lived
viola
ran
over
to
the
table
and
put
her
arms
round
the
jar
of
hyacinths
beautiful
beautiful
she
her
head
in
the
sniffing
greedily
at
the
scent
over
the
leaves
she
looked
at
the
man
and
laughed
you
are
a
funny
little
thing
said
he
lazily
why
because
i
love
flowers
i
d
far
rather

things
said
the
strange
man
slowly
she
broke
off
a
little
pink
petal
and
smiled
at
it

me
send
you
some
flowers
said
the
strange
man
i

voice
frightened
her
slightly
oh

one
is
quite
enough
for
no
it
isn
t
a
teasing
voice
what
a
stupid
remark
thought
viola
and
looking
at
him
again
he
did
not
seem
quite
so
jolly
she
noticed
that
his
eyes
were
set
too
closely
they
were
too
small
horrible
thought
that
he
should
prove
stupid
what
do
you
do
all
day
she
asked
hastily
nothing
at
all
why
should
i
do
anything

one
moment
that

condemn

caught

quite
amazed
to
realise
how
angry
she
felt
let

moment
when
he
was
not

her
she
quite
enjoyed

thrilled
at
her
own
angry
voice
to
think
i
should
talk
to
a
man
like
that
an
angry
flush
spread
over
his

he
did
not

with
an
expression
of
the
most
absurd
determination
he
pressed
ever
more
heavily
upon
her
he
did
not

out
in
a
sharp
voice

why

over
she
fastened
her

her
heart
said

i
thought
of

he
threw
her
away
from
him
she
saw
with
joy
that
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
you

he
said
in
a
choking
voice
of

shrugged
her
shoulders
and
laughed

and
tried
to
assault
me
who

rolled
her
eyes
at
him

moment
i

she
said
and
the
absurd
words
started
her
laughing
even
when
the
door
was
closed
hearing
him
descending
the
stairs
she
laughed
and
danced
about
the
room
what
a
morning
oh

d
d

reflected
if
only
that
beloved
casimir
could
have
seen
and
the
feeling
of
rage
and
disgust
against
casimir
had
totally
disappeared
how
could
the
poor
darling
help
not
having
any
money
it
was
her
fault
as
much
as
his
and
he
just
like
her
was
apart
from
the
world
fighting
it
just
as
she
had
done
if
only
three
o
clock
would
come
she
saw
herself
running
towards
him
and
putting
her
arms
round
his
neck

hands
clasped
in
her
lap
a
strange
light
shone
in
her
eyes
a
red
colour
stained
her
mouth
then
she
spoke
very
quietly
come
over
here
and
explain

that
when

asked

to

your
flowers
into

evening

let

white
and

her
breath
sharply

late
in

game
and
that

trump
card
all
along

a
poor
little
starved
kitten
that

carried
in
his
breast
never
dreaming
that
those
little
pink
claws
could
tear
out
a
man

she
stirred
looking
at
him
with
almost
fear
in
her
eyes
after
all
this
is
my
room
i
ll
have
to
ask
you
to
but
he
stumbled
towards
her

down
by
the
couch
burying
his
head
in
her
lap
clasping
his
arms
round
her
waist
and
i

her
head
into

pillows
then
his
muffled
voice
i

ashes
of

horrible
death

pushed

stumbled
to
his
