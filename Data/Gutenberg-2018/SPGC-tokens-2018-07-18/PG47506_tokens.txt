preface
this
book
contains
reproductions
of
the
famous
cottingley
photographs
and
gives
the
whole
of
the
evidence
in
connection
with
them
the
diligent
reader
is
in
almost
as
good
a
position
as
i
am
to
form
a
judgment
upon
the
authenticity
of
the
pictures
this
narrative
is
not
a
special
plea
for
that
authenticity
but
is
simply
a
collection
of
facts
the
inferences
from
which
may
be
accepted
or
rejected
as
the
reader
may
think
fit
i
would
warn
the
critic
however
not
to
be
led
away
by
the
sophistry
that
because
some
professional
trickster
apt
at
the
game
of
deception
can
produce
a
somewhat
similar
effect
therefore
the
originals
were
produced
in
the
same
way
there
are
few
realities
which
can
not
be
imitated
and
the
ancient
argument
that
because
conjurers
on
their
own
prepared
plates
or
stages
can
produce
certain
results
therefore
similar
results
obtained
by
untrained
people
under
natural
conditions
are
also
false
is
surely
discounted
by
the
intelligent
public
i
would
add
that
this
whole
subject
of
the
objective
existence
of
a
subhuman
form
of
life
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
larger
and
far
more
vital
question
of
spiritualism
i
should
be
sorry
if
my
arguments
in
favour
of
the
latter
should
be
in
any
way
weakened
by
my
exposition
of
this
very
strange
episode
which
has
really
no
bearing

the
continued
existence

chapter
i
how
the
matter
arose
the
series
of
incidents
set
forth
in
this
little
volume
represent
either
the
most
elaborate
and
ingenious
hoax
ever
played
upon
the
public
or
else
they
constitute
an
event
in
human
history
which
may
in
the
future
appear
to
have
been
in
its
character
it
is
hard
for
the
mind
to
grasp
what
the
ultimate
results
may
be
if
we
have
actually
proved
the
existence
upon
the
surface
of
this
planet
of
a
population
which
may
be
as
numerous
as
the
human
race
which
pursues
its
own
strange
life
in
its
own
strange
way
and
which
is
only
separated
from
ourselves
by
some
difference
of
vibrations
we
see
objects
within
the
limits
which
make
up
our
colour
spectrum
with
infinite
vibrations
unused
by
us
on
either
side
of
them
if
we
could
conceive
a
race
of
beings
which
were
constructed
in
material
which
threw
out
shorter
or
longer
vibrations
they
would
be
invisible
unless
we
could
tune
ourselves
up
or
tone
them
down
it
is
exactly
that
power
of
tuning
up
and
adapting
itself
to
other
vibrations
which
constitutes
a
clairvoyant
and
there
is
nothing
scientifically
impossible
so
far
as
i
can
see
in
some
people
seeing
that
which
is
invisible
to
others
if
the
objects
are
indeed
there
and
if
the
inventive
power
of
the
human
brain
is
turned
upon
the
problem
it
is
likely
that
some
sort
of
psychic
spectacles
inconceivable
to
us
at
the
moment
will
be
invented
and
that
we
shall
all
be
able
to
adapt
ourselves
to
the
new
conditions
if
electricity
can
be
converted
by
a
mechanical
contrivance
into
a
lower
tension
keyed
to
other
uses
then
it
is
hard
to
see
why
something
analogous
might
not
occur
with
the
vibrations
of
ether
and
the
waves
of
light
this
however
is
mere
speculation
and
leads
me
to
the
fact
that
early
in
may
i
heard
in
conversation
with
my
friend
gow
the
editor
of
that
alleged
photographs
of
fairies
had
been
taken
he
had
not
actually
seen
them
but
he
referred
me
to
miss
scatcherd
a
lady
for
whose
knowledge
and
judgment
i
had
considerable
respect
i
got
into
touch
with
her
and
found
that
she
also
had
not
seen
the
photographs
but
she
had
a
friend
miss
gardner
who
had
actually
done
so
on
may
miss
scatcherd
wrote
to
me
saying
that
she
was
getting
on
the
trail
and
including
an
extract
from
a
letter
of
miss
gardner
which
ran
as
follows
i
am
quoting
actual
documents
in
this
early
stage
for
i
think
there
are
many
who
would
like
a
complete
inside
view
of
all
that
led
up
to
so
remarkable
an
episode
alluding
to
her
brother
gardner
she
says
you
know
that
edward
is
a
theosophist
has
been
for
years
and
now
he
is
mostly
engaged
with
lecturing
and
other
work
for
the
society
and
although
for
years
i
have
regarded
him
as
bathed
in
error
and
almost
past
praying
for
i
now
find
a
talk
with
him
an
inspiring
privilege
i
am
so
very
thankful
that
i
happened
to
be
in
willesden
when
his
bereavement
took
place
for
it
was
so
wonderful
to
watch
him
and
to
see
how
marvellously
his
faith
and
beliefs
upheld
and
comforted
him
he
will
probably
devote
more
and
more
of
his
time
and
strength
to
going
about
the
country
lecturing
etc
i
wish
you
could
see
a
photo
he
has
he
believes
in
fairies
pixies
goblins
children
in
many
cases
really
see
them
and
play
with
them
he
has
got
into
touch
with
a
family
in
bradford
where
the
little
girl
elsie
and
her
cousin
frances
constantly
go
into
woods
and
play
with
the
fairies
the
father
and
mother
are
sceptical
and
have
no
sympathy
with
their
nonsense
as
they
call
it
but
an
aunt
whom
edward
has
interviewed
is
quite
sympathetic
with
the
girls
some
little
time
ago
elsie
said
she
wanted
to
photograph
them
and
begged
her
father
to
lend
his
camera
for
long
he
refused
but
at
last
she
managed
to
get
the
loan
of
it
and
one
plate
off
she
and
frances
went
into
the
woods
near
a
waterfall
frances
them
as
they
call
it
and
elsie
stood
ready
with
the
camera
soon
the
three
fairies
appeared
and
one
pixie
dancing
in
frances
aura
elsie
snapped
and
hoped
for
the
best
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
father
would
develop
the
photo
but
at
last
he
did
and
to
his
utter
amazement
the
four
sweet
little
figures
came
out
beautifully
edward
got
the
negative
and
took
it
to
a
specialist
in
photography
who
would
know
a
fake
at
once
sceptical
as
he
was
before
he
tested
it
afterwards
he
offered
down
for
it
he
pronounced
it
absolutely
genuine
and
a
perfectly
remarkable
photograph
edward
has
it
enlarged
and
hanging
in
his
hall
he
is
very
interested
in
it
and
as
soon
as
possible
he
is
going
to
bradford
to
see
the
children
what
do
you
think
of
this
edward
says
the
fairies
are
on
the
same
line
of
evolution
as
the
insects
etc
i
fear
i
can
not
follow
all
his
reasonings
but
i
knew
you
would
be
keenly
interested
i
wish
you
could
see
that
photo
and
another
one
of
the
girls
playing
with
the
quaintest
goblin
imaginable
this
letter
filled
me
with
hopes
and
i
renewed
my
pursuit
of
the
photographs
i
learned
that
they
were
two
in
number
and
that
they
had
been
sent
for
inspection
to
miss
blomfield
a
friend
of
the
family
my
chase
turned
therefore
in
that
direction
and
in
reply
to
a
letter
of
inquiry
i
received
the
following
answer
myrtles
beckenham
june
dear
sir
i
am
sending
the
two
fairy
pictures
they
interesting
are
they
not
i
am
sure
my
cousin
would
be
pleased
for
you
to
see
them
but
he
said
and
wrote
it
to
me
afterwards
that
he
did
not
want
them
to
be
used
in
any
way
at
present
i
believe
he
has
plans
in
regard
to
them
and
the
pictures
are
being
copyrighted
i
do
think
the
copyright
will
be
his
he
has
not
yet
finished
his
investigations
i
asked
him
if
i
might
photograph
them
myself
so
as
to
have
a
few
prints
to
give
to
friends
interested
but
he
wrote
that
he
would
rather
nothing
was
done
at
present
i
think
my
cousin
is
away
from
home
just
now
but
his
name
is
edward
gardner
and
he
is
president
of
one
of
the
branches
of
the
theosophical
society
blavatsky
lodge
and
he
lectures
fairly
often
at
their
hall
mortimer
hall
mortimer
square
he
lectured
there
a
few
weeks
ago
and
showed
the
fairies
on
the
screen
and
told
what
he
knew
about
them
yours
sincerely
blomfield
this
letter
enclosed
the
two
very
remarkable
photographs
which
are
reproduced
in
this
volume
that
which
depicted
the
dancing
goblin
and
the
other
of
wood
elves
in
a
ring
an
explanatory
note
setting
forth
the
main
points
of
each
is
appended
to
the
reproductions
i
was
naturally
delighted
at
the
wonderful
pictures
and
wrote
back
thanking
miss
blomfield
for
her
courtesy
and
suggesting
that
an
inquiry
should
be
set
on
foot
which
would
satisfy
me
as
to
the
genuine
nature
of
the
photographs
if
this
were
clearly
established
i
hoped
that
i
might
be
privileged
to
help
gardner
in
giving
publicity
to
the
discovery
in
reply
i
had
the
following
letter
myrtles
beckenham
june
dear
sir
arthur
i
am
so
glad
you
like
the
fairies
i
should
be
only
too
glad
to
help
in
any
way
if
i
could
but
there
is
so
little
i
can
do
had
the
photographs
been
mine
i
mean
the
negatives
i
should
have
been
most
pleased
that
anything
so
lovely
in
the
way
of
information
should
have
been
introduced
to
the
public
under
such
auspices
but
it
would
as
things
are
be
necessary
to
ask
my
cousin
i
believe
he
people
to
know
but
as
i
wrote
before
i
do
not
know
his
plans
and
i
not
sure
if
he
is
ready
it
has
occurred
to
me
since
writing
to
you
that
it
would
have
been
better
had
i
given
you
his
sister
address
she
is
a
most
sensible
and
practical
person
much
engaged
in
social
work
with
which
her
sympathetic
nature
and
general
efficiency
make
her
very
successful
she
believes
the
fairy
photographs
to
be
quite
genuine
edward
is
a
clever
man
and
a
good
one
his
evidence
on
any
of
the
affairs
of
life
would
i
am
sure
be
considered
most
reliable
by
all
who
knew
him
both
for
veracity
and
sound
judgment
i
hope
these
details
will
not
bore
you
but
i
thought
perhaps
some
knowledge
of
the
people
who
so
to
say
discovered
the
photographs
would
help
in
taking
you
step
nearer
the
source
i
do
not
see
any
opening
for
fraud
or
hoax
though
at
first
when
i
saw
the
prints
i
thought
there
must
be
some
other
explanation
than
the
simple
one
that
they
were
what
they
seemed
they
appeared
too
good
to
be
true
but
every
little
detail
i
have
since
heard
has
added
to
my
conviction
that
they
are
genuine
though
i
have
only
what
edward
tells
me
to
go
upon
he
is
hoping
to
obtain
more
from
the
same
girls
yours
sincerely
blomfield
at
about
the
same
time
i
received
a
letter
from
another
lady
who
had
some
knowledge
of
the
matter
it
ran
thus
croftdown
road
highgate
road
june
dear
sir
arthur
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
you
are
interested
in
the
fairies
if
they
were
really
taken
as
there
seems
good
reason
to
believe
the
event
is
no
less
than
the
discovery
of
a
new
world
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
to
mention
that
when
i
examined
them
with
a
magnifying
glass
i
noticed
as
an
artist
that
the
hands
do
not
appear
to
be
quite
the
same
as
ours
though
the
little
figures
look
otherwise
so
human
the
hands
seemed
to
me
something
like
this
there
followed
a
sketch
of
a
sort
of
fin
the
beard
in
the
little
gnome
seems
to
me
to
be
some
sort
of
appendage
though
it
would
no
doubt
be
called
a
beard
by
a
clairvoyant
seeing
him
also
it
occurs
to
me
that
the
whiteness
of
the
fairies
may
be
due
to
their
lack
of
shadow
which
may
also
explain
their
somewhat
flatness
yours
sincerely
may
bowley
i
was
now
in
a
stronger
position
since
i
had
actually
seen
the
photographs
and
learned
that
gardner
was
a
solid
person
with
a
reputation
for
sanity
and
character
i
therefore
wrote
to
him
stating
the
links
by
which
i
had
reached
him
and
saying
how
interested
i
was
in
the
whole
matter
and
how
essential
it
seemed
that
the
facts
should
be
given
to
the
public
so
that
free
investigation
might
be
possible
before
it
was
too
late
to
this
letter
i
had
the
following
reply
craven
road
harlesden
june
dear
sir
your
interesting
letter
of
the
has
just
reached
me
and
very
willingly
i
will
assist
you
in
any
way
that
may
be
possible
with
regard
to
the
photographs
the
story
is
rather
a
long
one
and
i
have
only
gathered
it
by
going
very
carefully
the
children
who
were
concerned
are
very
shy
and
reserved
indeed
they
are
of
a
mechanic
family
of
yorkshire
and
the
children
are
said
to
have
played
with
fairies
and
elves
in
the
woods
near
their
village
since
babyhood
i
will
not
attempt
to
narrate
the
story
here
however
perhaps
we
may
meet
for
that
but
when
i
at
length
obtained
a
view
of
the
rather
poor
prints
it
so
impressed
me
i
begged
for
the
actual
negatives
these
i
submitted
to
two
photographic
experts
one
in
london
and
one
in
leeds
the
first
who
was
unfamiliar
with
such
matters
declared
the
plates
to
be
perfectly
genuine
and
unfaked
but
inexplicable
the
second
who
did
know
something
of
the
subject
and
had
been
instrumental
in
exposing
several
psychic
fakes
was
also
entirely
satisfied
hence
i
proceeded
i
am
hopeful
of
getting
more
photographs
but
the
immediate
difficulty
is
to
arrange
for
the
two
girls
to
be
together
they
are
or
years
old
and
beginning
to
work
and
are
separated
by
a
few
miles
it
may
be
we
can
manage
it
and
thus
secure
photographs
of
the
other
varieties
besides
those
obtained
these
nature
spirits
are
of
the
order
and
i
should
greatly
like
to
secure
some
of
the
higher
but
two
children
such
as
these
are
are
rare
and
i
fear
now
that
we
are
late
because
almost
certainly
the
inevitable
will
shortly
happen
one
of
them
will
fall
in
love
and
then
hey
presto
by
the
way
i
am
anxious
to
avoid
the
money
consideration
i
may
not
succeed
but
would
far
rather
not
introduce
it
we
are
out
for
truth
and
nothing
soils
the
way
so
quickly
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
you
shall
have
everything
i
can
properly
give
you
sincerely
yours
sgd
edw
gardner
this
letter
led
to
my
going
to
london
and
seeing
gardner
whom
i
found
to
be
quiet
and
reserved
not
in
the
least
of
a
wild
or
visionary
type
he
showed
me
beautiful
enlargements
of
these
two
wonderful
pictures
and
he
gave
me
much
information
which
is
embodied
in
my
subsequent
account
neither
he
nor
i
had
actually
seen
the
girls
and
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
handle
the
personal
side
of
the
matter
while
i
should
examine
the
results
and
throw
them
into
literary
shape
it
was
arranged
between
us
that
he
should
visit
the
village
as
soon
as
convenient
and
make
the
acquaintance
of
everyone
concerned
in
the
meantime
i
showed
the
positives
and
sometimes
the
negatives
to
several
friends
whose
opinion
upon
psychic
matters
i
respected
of
these
sir
oliver
lodge
holds
a
premier
place
i
can
still
see
his
astonished
and
interested
face
as
he
gazed
at
the
pictures
which
i
placed
before
him
in
the
hall
of
the
athenæum
club
with
his
usual
caution
he
refused
to
accept
them
at
their
face
value
and
suggested
the
theory
that
the
californian
classical
dancers
had
been
taken
and
their
picture
superimposed
upon
a
rural
british
background
i
argued
that
we
had
certainly
traced
the
pictures
to
two
children
of
the
artisan
class
and
that
such
photographic
tricks
would
be
entirely
beyond
them
but
i
failed
to
convince
him
nor
am
i
sure
that
even
now
he
is
in
the
matter
my
most
earnest
critics
came
from
among
the
spiritualists
to
whom
a
new
order
of
being
as
remote
from
spirits
as
they
are
from
human
beings
was
an
unfamiliar
idea
and
who
feared
not
unnaturally
that
their
intrusion
would
complicate
that
spiritual
controversy
which
is
vital
to
so
many
of
us
one
of
these
was
a
gentleman
whom
i
will
call
lancaster
who
by
a
not
unusual
paradox
combined
considerable
psychic
powers
including
both
clairvoyance
and
clairaudience
with
great
proficiency
in
the
practice
of
his
very
prosaic
profession
he
had
claimed
that
he
had
frequently
seen
these
little
people
with
his
own
eyes
and
i
therefore
attached
importance
to
his
opinion
this
gentleman
had
a
spirit
guide
i
have
no
objection
to
the
smile
of
the
sceptic
and
to
him
he
referred
the
question
the
answer
showed
both
the
strength
and
the
weakness
of
such
psychic
inquiries
writing
to
me
in
july
he
said
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
less
i
like
it
i
mean
the
one
with
the
fairies
my
own
guide
says
it
was
taken
by
a
fair
man
short
with
his
hair
brushed
back
he
has
a
studio
with
a
lot
of
cameras
some
of
which
are
by
a
handle
he
did
not
make
it
to
sell
spiritualists
a
but
did
it
to
please
the
little
girl
in
the
picture
who
wrote
fairy
stories
which
he
illustrated
in
this
fashion
he
is
not
a
spiritualist
but
would
laugh
very
much
if
anyone
was
taken
in
by
it
he
does
not
live
near
where
we
were
and
the
place
is
all
different
the
houses
instead
of
being
in
straight
lines
are
dropped
about
all
over
the
place
apparently
he
was
not
english
i
should
think
it
was
either
denmark
or
los
angeles
by
the
description
which
i
give
you
for
what
it
is
worth
i
should
very
much
like
the
lens
which
would
take
persons
in
rapid
motion
with
the
clarity
of
the
photo
in
question
it
must
work
at
f
and
cost
fifty
guineas
if
a
penny
and
not
the
sort
of
lens
one
would
imagine
the
children
in
an
artisan
household
would
possess
in
a
hand
camera
and
yet
with
the
speed
with
which
it
was
taken
the
waterfall
in
the
background
is
blurred
sufficiently
to
justify
a
one
second
exposure
at
least
what
a
doubting
thomas
i
was
told
the
other
day
that
in
the
unlikely
event
of
my
ever
reaching
heaven
i
should
insist
on
starting
a
card
file
index
of
the
angels
and
starting
a
rifle
range
to
guard
against
the
possibility
of
invasion
from
hell
this
being
my
unfortunate
reputation
at
the
hands
of
the
people
who
claim
to
know
me
must
discount
my
criticisms
as
carping
to
a
certain
extent
at
all
events
these
psychic
impressions
and
messages
are
often
as
from
one
who
sees
in
a
glass
darkly
and
contain
a
curious
mixture
of
truth
and
error
upon
my
submitting
this
message
to
gardner
he
was
able
to
assure
me
that
the
description
was
on
the
whole
a
very
accurate
one
of
snelling
and
his
surroundings
the
gentleman
who
had
actually
handled
the
negatives
subjected
them
to
various
tests
and
made
enlarged
positives
it
was
therefore
this
intermediate
incident
and
not
the
original
inception
of
the
affair
which
had
impressed
itself
upon
lancaster
guide
all
this
is
of
course
quite
to
the
ordinary
reader
but
i
am
laying
all
the
documents
upon
the
table
lancaster
opinion
had
so
much
weight
with
us
and
we
were
so
impressed
by
the
necessity
of
sparing
no
possible
pains
to
get
at
truth
that
we
submitted
the
plates
to
fresh
examination
as
detailed
in
the
following
letter
craven
road
harlesden
july
dear
sir
arthur
just
a
line
to
report
progress
and
acknowledge
your
kind
letters
and
enclosure
from
kodak
a
week
back
after
your
reference
to
lancaster
opinion
i
thought
i
would
get
a
more
careful
examination
of
the
negatives
made
than
before
though
that
was
searching
enough
so
i
went
over
to
snelling
at
harrow
and
had
a
long
interview
with
him
again
impressing
him
with
the
importance
of
being
utterly
certain
i
told
you
i
think
that
this
snelling
has
had
a
varied
and
expert
connection
of
over
thirty
years
with
the
autotype
company
and
illingworth
large
photographic
factory
and
has
himself
turned
out
some
beautiful
work
in
natural
and
artificial
studio
studies
he
recently
started
for
himself
at
wealdstone
harrow
and
is
doing
well
snelling
report
on
the
two
negatives
is
positive
and
most
decisive
he
says
he
is
perfectly
certain
of
two
things
connected
with
these
photos
namely
one
exposure
only
all
the
figures
of
the
fairies
moved
during
exposure
which
was
instantaneous
as
i
put
all
sorts
of
pressing
questions
to
him
relating
to
paper
or
cardboard
figures
and
backgrounds
and
paintings
and
all
the
artifices
of
the
modern
studio
he
proceeded
to
demonstrate
by
showing
me
other
negatives
and
prints
that
certainly
supported
his
view
he
added
that
anyone
of
considerable
experience
could
detect
the
dark
background
and
double
exposure
in
the
negative
at
once
movement
was
as
easy
as
he
pointed
out
in
a
crowd
of
aeroplane
photos
he
had
by
him
i
do
not
pretend
to
follow
all
his
points
but
i
am
bound
to
say
he
thoroughly
convinced
me
of
the
above
two
which
seem
to
me
to
dispose
of
all
the
objections
hitherto
advanced
when
they
are
taken
together
is
willing
to
make
any
declaration
embodying
the
above
and
stakes
his
reputation
unhesitatingly
on
their
truth
i
am
away
from
london
from
wednesday
next
till
the
when
i
go
on
to
bingley
for
one
or
two
days
investigation
on
the
spot
i
propose
that
you
have
the
two
negatives
which
are
carefully
packed
and
can
be
posted
safely
for
this
fortnight
or
so
if
you
would
rather
not
handle
them
i
will
send
them
to
west
of
kodak
or
have
them
taken
to
him
for
his
opinion
for
i
think
as
you
say
it
would
be
worth
having
if
he
has
had
direct
and
extensive
practical
experience
i
am
very
anxious
now
to
see
this
right
through
as
though
i
felt
pretty
sure
before
i
am
more
than
ever
satisfied
now
after
that
interview

and

with
an

after
receiving
this
message
and
getting
possession
of
the
negatives
i
took
them
myself
to
the
kodak
company
offices
in
kingsway
where
i
saw
west
and
another
expert
of
the
company
they
examined
the
plates
carefully
and
neither
of
them
could
find
any
evidence
of
superposition
or
other
trick
on
the
other
hand
they
were
of
opinion
that
if
they
set
to
work
with
all
their
knowledge
and
resources
they
could
produce
such
pictures
by
natural
means
and
therefore
they
would
not
undertake
to
say
that
these
were
preternatural
this
of
course
was
quite
reasonable
if
the
pictures
are
judged
only
as
technical
productions
but
it
rather
savours
of
the
old
discredited
argument
that
because
a
trained
conjurer
can
produce
certain
effects
under
his
own
conditions
therefore
some
woman
or
child
who
gets
similar
effects
must
get
them
by
conjuring
it
was
clear
that
at
the
last
it
was
the
character
and
surroundings
of
the
children
upon
which
the
inquiry
must
turn
rather
than
upon
the
photos
themselves
i
had
already
endeavoured
to
open
up
human
relations
with
the
elder
girl
by
sending
her
a
book
and
i
had
received
the
following
little
note
in
reply
from
her
father
main
street
cottingley
bingley
july
dear
sir
i
hope
you
will
forgive
us
for
not
answering
your
letter
sooner
and
thanking
you
for
the
beautiful
book
you
so
kindly
sent
to
elsie
she
is
delighted
with
it
i
can
assure
you
we
do
appreciate
the
honour
you
have
done
her
the
book
came
last
saturday
morning
an
hour
after
we
had
left
for
the
seaside
for
our
holidays
so
we
did
not
receive
it
until
last
night
we
received
a
letter
from
gardner
at
the
same
time
and
he
proposes
coming
to
see
us
at
the
end
of
july
would
it
be
too
long
to
wait
until
then
when
we
could
explain
what
we
know
about
it
yours
very
gratefully
arthur
wright
it
was
evident
however
that
we
must
get
into
more
personal
touch
and
with
this
object
gardner
went
north
and
interviewed
the
whole
family
making
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
circumstances
at
the
spot
the
result
of
his
journey
is
given
in
the
article
which
i
published
in
the
which
covers
all
the
ground
i
will
only
add
the
letter
he
wrote
to
me
after
his
return
from
yorkshire
craven
road
harlesden
july
my
dear
conan
doyle
yours
just
to
hand
and
as
i
have
now
had
an
hour
to
sort
things
out
i
write
at
once
so
that
you
have
the
enclosed
before
you
at
the
earliest
moment
you
must
be
very
pressed
so
i
put
the
statement
as
simply
as
possible
leaving
you
to
use
just
what
you
think
fit
prepared
negatives
prints
of
quarter
and
enlarged
sizes
and
lantern
slides
i
have
all
here
also
on
tuesday
i
shall
have
my
own
photographs
of
the
valley
scenery
including
the
two
spots
shown
in
the
fairy
prints
and
also
prints
of
the
two
children
taken
in
with
their
shoes
and
stockings
off
just
as
they
played
in
the
beck
at
the
rear
of
their
house
i
also
have
a
print
of
elsie
showing
her
hand
with
regard
to
the
points
you
raise
i
have
definite
leave
and
permission
to
act
as
regards
the
use
made
of
these
photographs
in
any
way
i
think
best
publication
may
be
made
of
them
the
only
reserve
being
that
full
names
and
addresses
shall
be
withheld
copies
are
ready
here
for
england
and
the
kodak
people
and
also
the
illingworth
are
unwilling
to
testify
the
former
of
course
you
know
of
illingworths
claim
that
they
could
produce
by
means
of
clever
studio
painting
and
modelling
a
similar
negative
another
company
expert
made
assertions
concerning
the
construction
of
the
model
that
i
found
were
entirely
erroneous
directly
i
saw
the
real
ground
they
however
barred
any
publication
the
net
result
besides
snelling
views
is
that
the
photograph
be
produced
by
studio
work
but
there
is
no
evidence
of
such
work
in
the
negatives
i
might
add
that
snelling
whom
i
saw
again
yesterday
evening
scouts
the
claim
that
such
negatives
could
be
produced
he
states
that
he
would
pick
such
a
one
out
without
hesitation
my
report
is
enclosed
and
you
are
at
perfect
liberty
to
use
this
just
as
you
please
the
father
arthur
wright
impressed
me
favourably
he
was
perfectly
open
and
free
about
the
whole
matter
he
explained
his
position
he
simply
did
not
understand
the
business
but
is
quite
clear
and
positive
that
the
plate
he
took
out
of
the
midg
camera
was
the
one
he
put
in
the
same
day
his
work
is
that
of
electrician
to
an
estate
in
the
neighbourhood
near
he
is
and
very
intelligent
and
gives
one
the
impression
of
being
open
and
honest
i
learnt
the
reason
of
the
family
cordial
treatment
of
myself
wright
a
few
years
back
came
into
touch
with
theosophical
teachings
and
speaks
of
these
as
having
done
her
good
my
own
connection
with
the
theosophical
society
she
knew
of
and
this
gave
them
confidence
hence
the
very
cordial
reception
i
have
met
with
which
somewhat
had
puzzled
me
by
the
way
i
think
guide
ran
up
against
innocent
little
snelling
he
matches
the
description
quite
well
as
i
realized
last
night
and
he
did
prepare
the
new
negatives
from
which
the
prints
you
have
were
made
and
he
has
a
room
full
up
with
weird
machines
with
handles
and
devices
used
in
photography
sincerely
yours
edw
gardner
i
trust
that
the
reader
will
agree
that
up
to
this
point
we
had
not
proceeded
with
any
undue
rashness
or
credulity
and
that
we
had
taken
all
steps
to
test
the
case
and
had
no
alternative
if
we
were
unprejudiced
seekers
for
truth
but
to
go
ahead
with
it
and
place
our
results
before
the
public
so
that
others
might
discover
the
fallacy
which
we
had
failed
to
find
i
must
apologize
if
some
of
the
ground
in
the
article
which
follows
has
already
been
covered
in
this
introductory
chapter
chapter
ii
the
first
published
account
strand
christmas
number
should
the
incidents
here
narrated
and
the
photographs
attached
hold
their
own
against
the
criticism
which
they
will
excite
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
they
will
mark
an
epoch
in
human
thought
i
put
them
and
all
the
evidence
before
the
public
for
examination
and
judgment
if
i
am
myself
asked
whether
i
consider
the
case
to
be
absolutely
and
finally
proved
i
should
answer
that
in
order
to
remove
the
last
faint
shadow
of
doubt
i
should
wish
to
see
the
result
repeated
before
a
disinterested
witness
at
the
same
time
i
recognize
the
difficulty
of
such
a
request
since
rare
results
must
be
obtained
when
and
how
they
can
but
short
of
final
and
absolute
proof
i
consider
after
carefully
going
into
every
possible
source
of
error
that
a
strong
case
has
been
built
up
the
cry
of
fake
is
sure
to
be
raised
and
will
make
some
impression
upon
those
who
have
not
had
the
opportunity
of
knowing
the
people
concerned
or
the
place
on
the
photographic
side
every
objection
has
been
considered
and
adequately
met
the
pictures
stand
or
fall
together
both
are
false
or
both
are
true
all
the
circumstances
point
to
the
latter
alternative
and
yet
in
a
matter
involving
so
tremendous
a
new
departure
one
needs
overpowering
evidence
before
one
can
say
that
there
is
no
conceivable
loophole
for
error
it
was
about
the
month
of
may
in
this
year
that
i
received
the
information
from
miss
felicia
scatcherd
so
in
several
departments
of
human
thought
to
the
effect
that
two
photographs
of
fairies
had
been
taken
in
the
north
of
england
under
circumstances
which
seemed
to
put
fraud
out
of
the
question
the
statement
would
have
appealed
to
me
at
any
time
but
i
happened
at
the
moment
to
be
collecting
material
for
an
article
on
fairies
now
completed
and
i
had
accumulated
a
surprising
number
of
cases
of
people
who
claimed
to
be
able
to
see
these
little
creatures
the
evidence
was
so
complete
and
detailed
with
such
good
names
attached
to
it
that
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
it
was
false
but
being
by
nature
of
a
somewhat
sceptical
turn
i
felt
that
something
closer
was
needed
before
i
could
feel
personal
conviction
and
assure
myself
that
these
were
not
conjured
up
by
the
imagination
or
expectation
of
the
seers
the
rumour
of
the
photographs
interested
me
deeply
therefore
and
following
the
matter
up
from
one
lady
informant
to
another
i
came
at
last
upon
edward
gardner
who
has
been
ever
since
my
most
efficient
collaborator
to
whom
all
credit
is
due
gardner
it
may
be
remarked
is
a
member
of
the
executive
committee
of
the
theosophical
society
and
a
lecturer
upon
occult
subjects
he
had
not
himself
at
that
time
mastered
the
whole
case
but
all
he
had
he
placed
freely
at
my
disposal
i
had
already
seen
prints
of
the
photographs
but
i
was
relieved
to
find
that
he
had
the
actual
negatives
and
that
it
was
from
them
and
not
from
the
prints
that
two
expert
photographers
especially
snelling
of
the
bridge
wealdstone
harrow
had
already
formed
their
conclusions
in
favour
of
the
genuineness
of
the
pictures
gardner
tells
his
own
story
presently
so
i
will
simply
say
that
at
that
period
he
had
got
into
direct
and
friendly
touch
with
the
carpenter
family
we
are
compelled
to
use
a
pseudonym
and
to
withhold
the
exact
address
for
it
is
clear
that
their
lives
would
be
much
interrupted
by
correspondence
and
callers
if
their
identity
were
too
clearly
indicated
at
the
same
time
there
would
be
no
doubt
no
objection
to
any
small
committee
of
inquiry
verifying
the
facts
for
themselves
if
this
anonymity
were
respected
for
the
present
however
we
shall
simply
call
them
the
carpenter
family
in
the
village
of
dalesby
west
riding
some
three
years
before
according
to
our
information
the
daughter
and
the
niece
of
carpenter
the
former
being
sixteen
and
the
other
ten
years
of
age
had
taken
the
two
photographs
the
one
in
summer
the
other
in
early
autumn
the
father
was
quite
agnostic
in
the
matter
but
as
his
daughter
claimed
that
she
and
her
cousin
when
they
were
together
continually
saw
fairies
in
the
wood
and
had
come
to
be
on
familiar
and
friendly
terms
with
them
he
entrusted
her
with
one
plate
in
his
camera
the
result
was
the
picture
of
the
dancing
elves
which
considerably
amazed
the
father
when
he
developed
the
film
that
evening
the
little
girl
looking
across
at
her
playmate
to
intimate
that
the
time
had
come
to
press
the
button
is
alice
the
niece
while
the
older
girl
who
was
taken
some
months
later
with
the
quaint
gnome
is
iris
the
daughter
the
story
ran
that
the
girls
were
so
excited
in
the
evening
that
one
pressed
her
way
into
the
small
in
which
the
father
was
about
to
develop
and
that
as
she
saw
the
forms
of
the
fairies
showing
through
the
solution
she
cried
out
to
the
other
girl
who
was
palpitating
outside
the
door
oh
alice
alice
the
fairies
are
on
the
plate
they
are
on
the
plate
it
was
indeed
a
triumph
for
the
children
who
had
been
smiled
at
as
so
many
children
are
smiled
at
by
an
incredulous
world
for
stating
what
their
own
senses
have
actually
recorded
the
father
holds
a
position
of
trust
in
connection
with
some
local
factory
and
the
family
are
and
respected
that
they
are
cultivated
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
gardner
advances
towards
them
were
made
more
easy
because
carpenter
was
a
reader
of
theosophical
teachings
and
had
gained
spiritual
good
from
them
a
correspondence
had
arisen
and
all
their
letters
were
frank
and
honest
professing
some
amazement
at
the
stir
which
the
affair
seemed
likely
to
produce
thus
the
matter
stood
after
my
meeting
with
gardner
but
it
was
clear
that
this
was
not
enough
we
must
get
closer
to
the
facts
the
negatives
were
taken
round
to
kodak
where
two
experts
were
unable
to
find
any
flaw
but
refused
to
testify
to
the
genuineness
of
them
in
view
of
some
possible
trap
an
amateur
photographer
of
experience
refused
to
accept
them
on
the
ground
of
the
elaborate
and
parisian
coiffure
of
the
little
ladies
another
photographic
company
which
it
would
be
cruel
to
name
declared
that
the
background
consisted
of
theatrical
properties
and
that
therefore
the
picture
was
a
worthless
fake
i
leaned
heavily
upon
snelling
endorsement
quoted
later
in
this
article
and
also
consoled
myself
by
the
broad
view
that
if
the
local
conditions
were
as
reported
which
we
proposed
to
test
then
it
was
surely
impossible
that
a
little
village
with
an
amateur
photographer
could
have
the
plant
and
the
skill
to
turn
out
a
fake
which
could
not
be
detected
by
the
best
experts
in
london
the
matter
being
in
this
state
gardner
volunteered
to
go
up
at
once
and
report
an
expedition
which
i
should
have
wished
to
share
had
it
not
been
for
the
pressure
of
work
before
my
approaching
departure
for
australia
gardner
report
is
here
appended
craven
road
harlesden
july
it
was
early
in
this
year
that
i
heard
from
a
friend
of
photographs
of
fairies
having
been
successfully
taken
in
the
north
of
england
i
made
some
inquiries
and
these
led
to
prints
being
sent
to
me
with
the
names
and
address
of
the
children
who
were
said
to
have
taken
them
the
correspondence
that
followed
seemed
so
innocent
and
promising
that
i
begged
the
loan
of
the
actual
negatives
and
two
came
by
post
a
few
days
after
one
was
a
fairly
clear
one
the
other
much
the
negatives
proved
to
be
truly
astonishing
photographs
indeed
for
there
was
no
sign
of
double
exposure
nor
anything
other
than
ordinary
straightforward
work
i
cycled
over
to
harrow
to
consult
an
expert
photographer
of
thirty
years
practical
experience
whom
i
knew
i
could
trust
for
a
sound
opinion
without
any
explanation
i
passed
the
plates
over
and
asked
what
he
thought
of
them
after
examining
the
fairies
negative
carefully
exclamations
began
this
is
the
most
extraordinary
thing
i
ever
seen
single
exposure
figures
have
moved
why
it
a
genuine
photograph
wherever
did
it
come
from
i
need
hardly
add
that
enlargements
were
made
and
subjected
to
searching
examination
without
any
modification
of
opinion
the
immediate
upshot
was
that
a
positive
was
taken
from
each
negative
that
the
originals
might
be
preserved
carefully
untouched
and
then
new
negatives
were
prepared
and
intensified
to
serve
as
better
printing
mediums
the
originals
are
just
as
received
and
in
my
keeping
now
some
good
prints
and
lantern
slides
were
soon
prepared
in
may
i
used
the
slides
with
others
to
illustrate
a
lecture
given
in
the
mortimer
hall
london
and
this
aroused
considerable
interest
largely
because
of
these
pictures
and
their
story
a
week
or
so
later
i
received
a
letter
from
sir
conan
doyle
asking
for
information
concerning
them
some
report
i
understood
having
reached
him
from
a
mutual
friend
a
meeting
with
sir
arthur
followed
and
the
outcome
was
that
i
agreed
to
hasten
my
proposed
personal
investigation
into
the
origin
of
the
photographs
and
carry
this
through
at
once
instead
of
waiting
till
september
when
i
should
be
in
the
north
on
other
matters
in
consequence
july
i
am
just
back
in
london
from
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
surprising
excursions
that
it
has
ever
been
my
fortune
to
make
we
had
time
before
i
went
to
obtain
opinions
on
the
original
negatives
from
other
expert
photographers
and
one
or
two
of
these
were
adverse
rather
than
favourable
not
that
any
would
say
positively
that
the
photographs
were
faked
but
two
did
claim
that
they
produce
the
same
class
of
negative
by
studio
work
involving
painted
models
and
it
was
suggested
further
that
the
little
girl
in
the
first
picture
was
standing
behind
a
table
heaped
up
with
fern
and
moss
that
the
was
unnatural
that
in
the
gnome
photo
the
girl
hand
was
not
her
own
that
uniform
shading
was
questionable
and
so
on
all
of
this
had
its
weight
and
though
i
went
north
with
as
little
bias
one
way
or
the
other
as
possible
i
felt
quite
prepared
to
find
that
a
personal
investigation
would
disclose
some
evidence
of
falsity

the

of

is

by
the

as
being

pale

marked
in

and
fading
to
almost
pure

has
its
own
special
colour
the
lengthy
journey
completed
i
reached
a
quaint
village
in
yorkshire
found
the
house
and
was
cordially
received
and
her
daughter
i
the
girl
as
shown
playing
with
the
gnome
were
both
at
home
to
meet
me
and
the
father
came
in
shortly
afterwards
several
of
the
objections
raised
by
the
professionals
were
disposed
of
almost
at
once
as
a
after
reaching
the
house
i
was
exploring
a
charming
little
valley
directly
at
the
rear
with
a
stream
of
water
running
through
where
the
children
had
been
accustomed
to
see
and
play
with
the
fairies
i
found
the
bank
behind
which
the
child
with
her
shoes
and
stockings
off
is
shown
as
standing
exactly
as
in
the
photograph
were
about
in
plenty
quite
as
big
and
and
the
girl
hand
well
she
laughingly
made
me
promise
not
to
say
much
about
it
it
is
so
very
long
i
stood
on
the
spots
shown
and
easily
identified
every
feature
then
in
course
of
eliciting
all
that
one
could
learn
about
the
affair
i
gathered
the
following
which
for
the
sake
of
conciseness
i
set
out
below

used
the

described
as
seeming
to
be
in
black
tights
jersey
and
red
pointed
cap
he
was
swinging
his
pipes
holding
them
in
his
left
hand
and
was
just
stepping
up
on
to
i
knee
when
snapped
him
the
visiting
cousin
went
away
soon
after
and
says
they
must
be
together
to
take
photographs
fortunately
they
will
meet
in
a
few
weeks
time
and
they
promise
me
to
try
to
get
some
more
added
she
would
very
much
like
to
send
me
one
of
a
fairy
flying
testimony
was
clear
and
decisive
his
daughter
had
pleaded
to
be
allowed
to
use
the
camera
at
first
he
demurred
but
ultimately
after
dinner
one
saturday
he
put
just
one
plate
in
the
midg
and
gave
it
to
the
girls
they
returned
in
less
than
an
hour
and
begged
him
to
develop
the
plate
as
had
taken
a
photograph
he
did
so
with
to
him
the
bewildering
result
shown
in
the
print
of
the
fairies
says
she
remembers
quite
well
that
the
girls
were
only
away
from
the
house
a
short
time
before
they
brought
the
camera
back
extraordinary
and
amazing
as
these
photographs
may
appear
i
am
now
quite
convinced
of
their
entire
genuineness
as
indeed
would
everyone
else
be
who
had
the
same
evidence
of
transparent
honesty
and
simplicity
that
i
had
i
am
adding
nothing
by
way
of
explanations
or
theories
of
my
own
though
the
need
for
two
people
preferably
children
is
fairly
obvious
for
photography
in
order
to
assist
in
the
strengthening
of
the
etheric
bodies
beyond
this
i
prefer
to
leave
the
above
statement
as
a
plain
unvarnished
narrative
of
my
connection
with
the
incidents
i
need
only
add
that
no
attempt
appears
ever
to
have
been
made
by
the
family
to
make
these
photographs
public
and
whatever
has
been
done
in
that
direction
locally
has
not
been
pressed
by
any
of
them
nor
has
there
been
any
money
payment
in
connection
with
them
edward
gardner
i
may
add
as
a
footnote
to
gardner
report
that
the
girl
informed
him
in
conversation
that
she
had
no
power
of
any
sort
over
the
actions
of
the
fairies
and
that
the
way
to
them
as
she
called
it
was
to
sit
passively
with
her
mind
quietly
turned
in
that
direction
then
when
faint
stirrings
or
movements
in
the
distance
heralded
their
presence
to
beckon
towards
them
and
show
that
they
were
welcome
it
was
iris
who
pointed
out
the
pipes
of
the
gnome
which
we
had
both
taken
as
being
the
markings
of
the
she
added
that
if
there
was
not
too
much
rustling
in
the
wood
it
was
possible
to
hear
the
very
faint
and
high
sound
of
the
pipes
to
the
objections
of
photographers
that
the
fairy
figures
show
quite
different
shadows
to
those
of
the
human
our
answer
is
that
ectoplasm
as
the
etheric
protoplasm
has
been
named
has
a
faint
luminosity
of
its
own
which
would
largely
modify
shadows
to
the
very
clear
and
as
i
think
entirely
convincing
report
of
gardner
let
me
add
the
exact
words
which
snelling
the
expert
photographer
allows
us
to
use
snelling
has
shown
great
strength
of
mind
and
rendered
signal
service
to
psychic
study
by
taking
a
strong
line
and
putting
his
professional
reputation
as
an
expert
upon
the
scales
he
has
had
a
varied
connection
of
over
thirty
years
with
the
autotype
company
and
illingworth
large
photographic
factory
and
has
himself
turned
out
some
beautiful
work
of
every
kind
of
natural
and
artificial
studio
studies
he
laughs
at
the
idea
that
any
expert
in
england
could
deceive
him
with
a
faked
photograph
these
two
negatives
he
says
are
entirely
genuine
unfaked
photographs
of
single
exposure
work
show
movement
in
the
fairy
figures
and
there
is
no
trace
whatever
of
studio
work
involving
card
or
paper
models
dark
backgrounds
painted
figures
etc
in
my
opinion
they
are
both
straight
untouched
pictures
a
second
independent
opinion
is
equally
clear
as
to
the
genuine
character
of
the
photographs
founded
upon
a
large
experience
of
practical
photography
there
is
our
case
fortified
by
pictures
of
the
places
which
the
unhappy
critic
has
declared
to
be
theatrical
properties
how
well
we
know
that
type
of
critic
in
all
our
psychic
work
though
it
is
not
always
possible
to
at
once
show
his
absurdity
to
other
people
i
will
now
make
a
few
comments
upon
the
two
pictures
which
i
have
studied
long
and
earnestly
with
a
lens
one
fact
of
interest
is
this
presence
of
a
double
pipe
the
very
sort
which
the
ancients
associated
with
fauns
and
naiads
in
each
picture
but
if
pipes
why
not
everything
else
does
it
not
suggest
a
complete
range
of
utensils
and
instruments
for
their
own
life
their
clothing
is
substantial
enough
it
seems
to
me
that
with
fuller
knowledge
and
with
fresh
means
of
vision
these
people
are
destined
to
become
just
as
solid
and
real
as
the
eskimos
there
is
an
ornamental
rim
to
the
pipe
of
the
elves
which
shows
that
the
graces
of
art
are
not
unknown
among
them
and
what
joy
is
in
the
complete
abandon
of
their
little
graceful
figures
as
they
let
themselves
go
in
the
dance
they
may
have
their
shadows
and
trials
as
we
have
but
at
least
there
is
a
great
gladness
manifest
in
this
demonstration
of
their
life
a
second
general
observation
is
that
the
elves
are
a
compound
of
the
human
and
the
butterfly
while
the
gnome
has
more
of
the
moth
this
may
be
merely
the
result
of
of
the
negative
and
dullness
of
the
weather
perhaps
the
little
gnome
is
really
of
the
same
tribe
but
represents
an
elderly
male
while
the
elves
are
romping
young
women
most
observers
of
fairy
life
have
reported
however
that
there
are
separate
species
varying
very
much
in
size
appearance
and
locality
the
wood
fairy
the
water
fairy
the
fairy
of
the
plains
etc
can
these
be
the
fact
that
they
are
so
like
our
conventional
idea
of
fairies
is
in
favour
of
the
idea
but
if
they
move
rapidly
have
musical
instruments
and
so
forth
then
it
is
impossible
to
talk
of
a
term
which
suggests
something
vague
and
intangible
in
a
sense
we
are
all
since
we
can
only
be
perceived
through
the
senses
but
these
little
figures
would
seem
to
have
an
objective
reality
as
we
have
ourselves
even
if
their
vibrations
should
prove
to
be
such
that
it
takes
either
psychic
power
or
a
sensitive
plate
to
record
them
if
they
are
conventional
it
may
be
that
fairies
have
really
been
seen
in
every
generation
and
so
some
correct
description
of
them
has
been
retained
there
is
one
point
of
gardner
investigation
which
should
be
mentioned
it
had
come
to
our
knowledge
that
iris
could
draw
and
had
actually
at
one
time
done
some
designs
for
a
jeweller
this
naturally
demanded
caution
though
the
girl
own
frank
nature
is
i
understand
a
sufficient
guarantee
for
those
who
know
her
gardner
however
tested
her
powers
of
drawing
and
found
that
while
she
could
do
landscapes
cleverly
the
fairy
figures
which
she
had
attempted
in
imitation
of
those
she
had
seen
were
entirely
uninspired
and
bore
no
possible
resemblance
to
those
in
the
photograph
another
point
which
may
be
commended
to
the
careful
critic
with
a
strong
lens
is
that
the
apparent
pencilled
face
at
the
side
of
the
figure
on
the
right
is
really
only
the
edge
of
her
hair
and
not
as
might
appear
a
drawn
profile
i
must
confess
that
after
months
of
thought
i
am
unable
to
get
the
true
bearings
of
this
event
one
or
two
consequences
are
obvious
the
experiences
of
children
will
be
taken
more
seriously
cameras
will
be
forthcoming
other
cases
will
come
along
these
little
folk
who
appear
to
be
our
neighbours
with
only
some
small
difference
of
vibration
to
separate
us
will
become
familiar
the
thought
of
them
even
when
unseen
will
add
a
charm
to
every
brook
and
valley
and
give
romantic
interest
to
every
country
walk
the
recognition
of
their
existence
will
jolt
the
material
mind
out
of
its
heavy
ruts
in
the
mud
and
will
make
it
admit
that
there
is
a
glamour
and
a
mystery
to
life
having
discovered
this
the
world
will
not
find
it
so
difficult
to
accept
that
spiritual
message
supported
by
physical
facts
which
has
already
been
so
convincingly
put
before
it
all
this
i
see
but
there
may
be
much
more
when
columbus
knelt
in
prayer
upon
the
edge
of
america
what
prophetic
eye
saw
all
that
a
new
continent
might
do
to
affect
the
destinies
of
the
world
we
also
seem
to
be
on
the
edge
of
a
new
continent
separated
not
by
oceans
but
by
subtle
and
surmountable
psychic
conditions
i
look
at
the
prospect
with
awe
may
those
little
creatures
suffer
from
the
contact
and
some
las
casas
bewail
their
ruin
if
so
it
would
be
an
evil
day
when
the
world
defined
their
existence
but
there
is
a
guiding
hand
in
the
affairs
of
man
and
we
can
but
trust
and
follow
chapter
iii
reception
of
the
first
photographs
though
i
was
out
of
england
at
the
time
i
was
able
even
in
australia
to
realize
that
the
appearance
of
the
first
photographs
in
the
had
caused
very
great
interest
the
press
comments
were
as
a
rule
cautious
but
not
unsympathetic
the
old
cry
of
fake
was
less
conspicuous
than
i
had
expected
but
for
some
years
the
press
has
been
slowly
widening
its
views
upon
psychic
matters
and
is
not
so
inclined
as
of
old
to
attribute
every
new
manifestation
to
fraud
some
of
the
yorkshire
papers
had
made
elaborate
inquiries
and
i
am
told
that
photographers
for
a
considerable
radius
from
the
house
were
to
find
if
they
were
accomplices
which
is
obsessed
by
the
idea
that
the
whole
spiritualistic
movement
and
everything
connected
with
it
is
one
huge
senseless
conspiracy
to
deceive
concocted
by
knaves
and
accepted
by
fools
had
the
usual
contemptuous
and
contemptible
articles
which
ended
by
a
prayer
to
elsie
that
she
should
finish
her
fun
and
let
the
public
know
how
it
really
was
done
the
best
of
the
critical
attacks
was
in
the
who
sent
a
special
commissioner
to
unravel
the
mystery
and
published
the
result
on
january
by
kind
permission
i
reproduce
the
article
do
fairies
exist
investigation
in
a
yorkshire
valley
cottingley
mystery
story
of
the
girl
who
took
the
snapshot
the
publication
of
photographs
of
fairies
or
to
be
more
explicit
one
photograph
of
fairies
and
another
of
a
gnome
playing
round
children
has
aroused
considerable
interest
not
only
in
yorkshire
where
the
beings
are
said
to
exist
but
throughout
the
country
the
story
mysterious
as
it
was
when
first
told
became
even
more
enigmatical
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
sir
conan
doyle
made
use
of
fictitious
names
in
his
narrative
in
the
in
order
as
he
says
to
prevent
the
lives
of
the
people
concerned
being
interrupted
by
callers
and
correspondence
that
he
has
failed
to
do
i
am
afraid
sir
conan
does
not
know
yorkshire
people
particularly
those
of
the
dales
because
any
attempt
to
hide
identity
immediately
arouses
their
suspicions
if
it
does
not
go
so
far
as
to
condemn
the
writer
for
his
lack
of
frankness
it
is
not
surprising
therefore
that
his
story
is
accepted
with
reserve
each
person
to
whom
i
spoke
of
the
subject
during
my
brief
sojourn
in
yorkshire
dismissed
the
matter
curtly
as
being
untrue
it
has
been
the
principal
topic
of
conversation
for
weeks
mainly
because
identity
had
been
discovered
my
mission
to
yorkshire
was
to
secure
evidence
if
possible
which
would
prove
or
disprove
the
claim
that
fairies
existed
i
frankly
confess
that
i
failed
the
particular
fairyland
is
a
picturesque
little
spot
off
the
beaten
track
two
or
three
miles
from
bingley
here
is
a
small
village
called
cottingley
almost
hidden
in
a
break
in
the
upland
through
which
tumbles
a
tiny
stream
known
as
cottingley
beck
on
its
way
to
the
aire
less
than
a
mile
away
the
heroine
of
sir
conan
doyle
story
is
miss
elsie
wright
who
resides
with
her
parents
at
lynwood
terrace
the
little
stream
runs
past
the
back
of
the
house
and
the
photographs
were
taken
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
away
when
miss
wright
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
fairies
she
was
accompanied
by
her
cousin
frances
griffiths
who
resides
at
dean
road
scarborough
one
photograph
taken
by
miss
wright
in
the
summer
of
when
she
was
sixteen
shows
her
cousin
then
a
child
of
ten
with
a
group
of
four
fairies
dancing
in
the
air
before
her
and
in
the
other
taken
some
months
afterwards
elsie
seated
on
the
grass
has
a
quaint
gnome
dancing
beside
her
there
are
certain
facts
which
stand
out
clearly
and
which
none
of
the
evidence
i
was
able
to
obtain
could
shake
no
other
people
have
seen
the
fairies
though
everybody
in
the
little
village
knew
of
their
alleged
existence
when
elsie
took
the
photograph
she
was
unacquainted
with
the
use
of
a
camera
and
succeeded
at
the
first
attempt
the
girls
did
not
invite
a
third
person
to
see
the
wonderful
visitors
and
no
attempt
was
made
to
make
the
discovery
public
first
i
interviewed
wright
who
without
hesitation
narrated
the
whole
of
the
circumstances
without
adding
any
comment
the
girls
she
said
would
spend
the
whole
of
the
day
in
the
narrow
valley
even
taking
their
lunch
with
them
though
they
were
within
a
stone
throw
of
the
house
elsie
was
not
robust
and
did
not
work
during
the
summer
months
so
that
she
could
derive
as
much
benefit
as
possible
from
playing
in
the
open
she
had
often
talked
about
seeing
the
fairies
but
her
parents
considered
it
was
nothing
more
than
childish
fancy
and
let
it
pass
wright
came
into
possession
of
a
small
camera
in
and
one
saturday
afternoon
yielded
to
the
persistent
entreaties
of
his
daughter
and
allowed
her
to
take
it
out
he
placed
one
plate
in
position
and
explained
to
her
how
to
take
a
snap
the
children
went
away
in
high
glee
and
returned
in
less
than
an
hour
requesting
wright
to
develop
the
plate
while
this
was
being
done
elsie
noticed
that
the
fairies
were
beginning
to
show
and
exclaimed
in
an
excited
tone
to
her
cousin
oh
frances
the
fairies
are
on
the
plate
the
second
photograph
was
equally
successful
and
a
few
prints
from
each
plate
were
given
to
friends
as
curiosities
about
a
year
ago
they
evidently
attracted
little
notice
until
one
was
shown
to
some
of
the
delegates
at
a
theosophical
congress
in
harrogate

summer

this

and
two
following
d

have
been
as
strictly
examined
as
the
earlier
ones
and
similarly
disclose
no
trace
of
being
other
than
perfectly
genuine
photographs
also
they
proved
to
have
been
taken
from
the
packet
given
them
each
plate
having
been
privately
marked
unknown
to
the
girls
wright
certainly
gave
me
the
impression
that
she
had
no
desire
to
keep
anything
back
and
answered
my
questions
quite
frankly
she
told
me
that
elsie
had
always
been
a
truthful
girl
and
there
were
neighbours
who
accepted
the
story
of
the
fairies
simply
on
the
strength
of
their
knowledge
of
her
i
asked
about
elsie
career
and
her
mother
said
that
after
she
left
school
she
worked
a
few
months
for
a
photographer
in
manningham
lane
bradford
but
did
not
care
for
running
errands
most
of
the
day
the
only
other
work
she
did
there
was
spotting
neither
occupation
was
likely
to
teach
a
girl
how
to
fake
a
plate
from
there
she
went
to
a
jeweller
shop
but
her
stay
there
was
not
prolonged
for
many
months
immediately
prior
to
taking
the
first
photograph
she
was
at
home
and
did
not
associate
with
anyone
who
possessed
a
camera
at
that
time
her
father
knew
little
of
photography
only
what
he
had
picked
up
by
dodging
about
with
the
camera
as
he
put
it
and
any
suggestion
that
he
had
faked
the
plate
must
be
dismissed
when
he
came
home
from
the
neighbouring
mill
and
was
told
the
nature
of
my
errand
he
said
he
was
fed
up
with
the
whole
business
and
had
nothing
else
to
tell
however
he
detailed
the
story
i
had
already
heard
from
his
wife
agreeing
in
every
particular
and
account
given
to
me
in
bradford
added
nothing
thus
i
had
the
information
from
the
three
members
of
the
family
at
different
times
and
without
variation
the
parents
confessed
they
had
some
difficulty
in
accepting
the
photographs
as
genuine
and
even
questioned
the
girls
as
to
how
they
faked
them
the
children
persisted
in
their
story
and
denied
any
act
of
dishonesty
then
they
let
it
go
at
that
even
now
their
belief
in
the
existence
of
the
fairies
is
merely
an
acceptance
of
the
statements
of
their
daughter
and
her
cousin
i
ascertained
that
elsie
was
described
by
her
late
schoolmaster
as
being
dreamy
and
her
mother
said
that
anything
imaginative
appealed
to
her
as
to
whether
she
could
have
drawn
the
fairies
when
she
was
sixteen
i
am
doubtful
lately
she
has
taken
up
drawing
and
her
work
which
i
carefully
examined
does
not
reveal
that
ability
in
a
marked
degree
though
she
possesses
a
remarkable
knowledge
of
colour
for
an
untrained
artist
sir
conan
doyle
says
that
at
first
he
was
not
convinced
that
the
fairies
were
not
conjured
up
by
the
imagination
or
expectation
of
the
seers
gardner
a
member
of
the
executive
committee
of
the
theosophical
society
who
made
an
investigation
on
the
spot
and
also
interviewed
all
the
members
of
the
family
records
his
opinion
that
the
photographs
are
genuine
later
in
the
day
i
went
to
bradford
and
at
sharpe
christmas
card
manufactory
saw
miss
wright
she
was
working
in
an
upper
room
and
at
first
refused
to
see
me
sending
a
message
to
the
effect
that
she
did
not
desire
to
be
interviewed
a
second
request
was
successful
and
she
appeared
at
a
small
counter
at
the
entrance
to
the
works
she
is
a
tall
slim
girl
with
a
wealth
of
auburn
hair
through
which
a
narrow
gold
band
circling
her
head
was
entwined
like
her
parents
she
just
said
she
had
nothing
to
say
about
the
photographs
and
singularly
enough
used
the
same
expression
as
her
father
and
mother
i
am
up
with
the
thing
she
gradually
became
communicative
and
told
me
how
she
came
to
take
the
first
photograph
asked
where
the
fairies
came
from
she
replied
that
she
did
not
know
did
you
see
them
come
i
asked
and
on
receiving
an
affirmative
reply
suggested
that
she
must
have
noticed
where
they
came
from
miss
wright
hesitated
and
laughingly
answered
i
ca
say
she
was
equally
at
a
loss
to
explain
where
they
went
after
dancing
near
her
and
was
embarrassed
when
i
pressed
for
a
fuller
explanation
two
or
three
questions
went
unanswered
and
my
suggestion
that
they
must
have
simply
vanished
into
the
air
drew
the
monosyllabic
reply
yes
they
did
not
speak
to
her
she
said
nor
did
she
speak
to
them
when
she
had
been
with
her
cousin
she
had
often
seen
them
before
they
were
only
kiddies
when
they
first
saw
them
she
remarked
and
did
not
tell
anybody
but
i
went
on
it
is
natural
to
expect
that
a
child
seeing
fairies
for
the
first
time
would
tell
its
mother
her
answer
was
to
repeat
that
she
did
not
tell
anybody
the
first
occasion
on
which
fairies
were
seen
it
transpired
was
in
in
reply
to
further
questions
miss
wright
said
she
had
seen
them
since
and
had
photographed
them
and
the
plates
were
in
the
possession
of
gardner
even
after
several
prints
of
the
first
lot
of
fairies
had
been
given
to
friends
she
did
not
inform
anybody
that
she
had
seen
them
again
the
fact
that
nobody
else
in
the
village
had
seen
them
gave
her
no
surprise
she
firmly
believed
that
she
and
her
cousin
were
the
only
persons
who
had
been
so
fortunate
and
was
equally
convinced
that
nobody
else
would
be
if
anybody
else
were
there
she
said
the
fairies
would
not
come
out
further
questions
put
with
the
object
of
eliciting
a
reason
for
that
statement
were
only
answered
with
smiles
and
a
final
significant
remark
you
do
understand
miss
wright
still
believes
in
the
existence
of
the
fairies
and
is
looking
forward
to
seeing
them
again
in
the
coming
summer
the
fairies
of
cottingley
as
they
appeared
to
the
two
girls
are
elves
as
miss
wright
said
they
appeared
only
when
it
was
bright
and
sunny
never
when
the
weather
was
dull
or
wet
the
strangest
part
of
the
girl
story
was
her
statement
that
in
their
more
recent
appearances
the
fairies
were
more
transparent
than
in
and
when
they
were
rather
hard
then
she
added
the
qualification
you
see
we
were
young
then
this
she
did
not
amplify
though
pressed
to
do
so
the
hitherto
obscure
village
promises
to
be
the
scene
of
many
pilgrimages
during
the
coming
summer
there
is
an
old
saying
in
yorkshire
ah
believe
what
ah
see
which
is
still
maintained
as
a
valuable
maxim
the
general
tone
of
this
article
makes
it
clear
that
the
commissioner
would
very
naturally
have
been
well
pleased
to
effect
a
by
showing
up
the
whole
concern
he
was
however
a
and
intelligent
man
and
has
easily
exchanged
the
rôle
of
counsel
for
the
prosecution
to
that
of
a
tolerant
judge
it
will
be
observed
that
he
brought
out
no
new
fact
which
had
not
already
appeared
in
my
article
save
the
interesting
point
that
this
was
absolutely
the
first
photograph
which
the
children
had
ever
taken
in
their
lives
is
it
conceivable
that
under
such
circumstances
they
could
have
produced
a
picture
which
was
fraudulent
and
yet
defied
the
examination
of
so
many
experts
granting
the
honesty
of
the
father
which
no
one
has
ever
impugned
elsie
could
only
have
done
it
by
images
which
must
have
been
of
exquisite
beauty
of
many
different
models
fashioned
and
kept
without
the
knowledge
of
her
parents
and
capable
of
giving
the
impression
of
motion
when
carefully
examined
by
an
expert
surely
this
is
a
large
order
in
the
article
it
is
clear
that
the
writer
has
not
had
much
acquaintance
with
psychic
research
his
surprise
that
a
young
girl
should
not
know
whence
appearances
come
or
whither
they
go
when
they
are
psychic
forms
materializing
in
her
own
peculiar
aura
does
not
seem
reasonable
it
is
a
familiar
fact
also
that
psychic
phenomena
are
always
more
active
in
warm
sunny
weather
than
in
damp
or
cold
finally
the
girl
remark
that
the
shapes
were
getting
more
diaphanous
was
a
very
suggestive
one
for
it
is
with
childhood
that
certain
forms
of
mediumship
are
associated
and
there
is
always
the
tendency
that
as
the
child
becomes
the
woman
and
as
the
mind
becomes
more
sophisticated
and
commonplace
the
phase
will
pass
the
refining
process
can
be
observed
in
the
second
series
of
pictures
especially
in
the
little
figure
which
is
holding
out
the
flower
we
fear
that
it
has
now
completed
itself
and
that
we
shall
have
no
more
demonstrations
of
fairy
life
from
this
particular
source
one
line
of
attack
upon
the
genuine
character
of
the
photographs
was
the
production
of
a
fake
and
the
argument
there
you
see
how
good
that
is
and
yet
it
is
an
admitted
fake
how
can
you
be
sure
that
yours
are
not
so
also
the
fallacy
of
this
reasoning
lay
in
the
fact
that
these
imitations
were
done
by
skilled
performers
while
the
originals
were
by
untrained
children
it
is
a
repetition
of
the
stale
and
rotten
argument
by
which
the
world
has
been
befooled
so
long
that
because
a
conjurer
under
his
own
conditions
can
imitate
certain
effects
therefore
the
effects
themselves
never
existed
it
must
be
admitted
that
some
of
these
attempts
were
very
well
done
though
none
of
them
passed
the
scrutiny
of
gardner
or
myself
the
best
of
them
was
by
a
lady
photographer
connected
with
the
bradford
institute
miss
ina
inman
whose
production
was
so
good
that
it
caused
us
for
some
weeks
to
regard
it
with
an
open
mind
there
was
also
a
weird
but
effective
arrangement
by
judge
docker
of
australia
in
the
case
of
miss
inman
elves
clever
as
they
were
there
was
nothing
of
the
natural
grace
and
freedom
of
movement
which
characterize
the
wonderful
cottingley
fairy
group
among
the
more
remarkable
comments
in
the
press
was
one
from
george
a
wade
in
the
london
of
december
it
told
of
a
curious
sequence
of
events
in
yorkshire
and
ran
as
follows
are
there
real
fairies
in
the
land
the
question
has
been
raised
by
sir
arthur
conan
doyle
and
there
have
been
submitted
photographs
which
purport
to
be
those
of
actual
people
experiences
which
have
come
within
my
own
knowledge
may
help
to
throw
a
little
light
on
this
question
as
to
whether
there
are
real
fairies
actual
elves
and
gnomes
yet
to
be
met
with
in
the
dales
of
yorkshire
where
the
photographs
are
asserted
to
have
been
taken
whilst
spending
a
day
last
year
with
my
friend
halliwell
sutcliffe
the
novelist
who
lives
in
that
district
he
told
me
to
my
intense
surprise
that
he
personally
knew
a
schoolmaster
not
far
from
his
home
who
had
again
and
again
insisted
that
he
had
seen
talked
with
and
had
played
with
real
fairies
in
some
meadows
not
far
away
the
novelist
mentioned
this
to
me
as
an
actual
curious
fact
for
which
he
himself
had
no
explanation
but
he
said
that
the
man
was
one
whose
education
personality
and
character
made
him
worthy
of
credence
a
man
not
likely
to
harbour
a
delusion
or
to
wish
to
deceive
others
whilst
in
the
same
district
i
was
informed
by
a
man
whom
i
knew
to
be
thoroughly
reliable
that
a
young
lady
living
in
skipton
had
mentioned
to
him
more
than
once
that
she
often
went
up
to
a
spot
in
the
dales
the
name
of
which
he
gave
to
and
dance
with
the
fairies
when
he
expressed
astonishment
at
the
statement
she
repeated
it
and
averred
that
it
was
really
true
in
chatting
about
the
matter
with
my
friend
william
riley
the
author
of
and
and
a
writer
who
knows
the
yorkshire
moors
and
dales
intimately
riley
asserted
that
though
he
had
never
seen
actual
fairies
there
yet
he
knew
several
trustworthy
moorland
people
whose
belief
in
them
was
unshakable
and
who
persisted
against
all
contradiction
that
they
themselves
had
many
times
seen
pixies
at
certain
favoured
spots
in
upper
airedale
and
wharfedale
when
some
time
later
an
article
of
mine
anent
these
things
was
published
in
a
yorkshire
newspaper
there
came
a
letter
from
a
lady
at
a
distance
who
stated
that
the
account
confirmed
a
strange
experience
which
she
had
when
on
holiday
in
the
same
dale
up
above
skipton
she
stated
that
one
evening
when
walking
alone
on
the
higher
portion
of
a
slope
of
the
hills
to
her
intense
astonishment
she
saw
in
a
meadow
close
below
her
fairies
and
sprites
playing
and
dancing
in
large
numbers
she
imagined
that
she
must
be
dreaming
or
under
some
hallucination
so
she
pinched
herself
and
rubbed
her
eyes
to
make
sure
that
she
was
really
awake
convinced
of
this
she
looked
again
and
still
unmistakably
saw
the
people
she
gave
a
full
account
of
how
they
played
of
the
long
time
she
watched
them
and
how
at
length
they
vanished
without
a
doubt
she
was
convinced
of
the
truth
of
her
statement
what
can
we
make
of
it
all
my
own
mind
is
open
but
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
so
many
persons
unknown
to
one
another
should
have
conspired
to
state
what
is
false
it
is
a
remarkable
coincidence
if
nothing
more
that
the
girls
in
sir
arthur
conan
doyle
account
the
schoolmaster
mentioned
by
sutcliffe
the
young
woman
who
came
from
skipton
and
the
lady
who
wrote
to
the
yorkshire
newspaper
should
all
put
the
spot
where
the
fairies
are
to
be
seen
almost
within
a
mile
or
two
of
one
another
are
there
real
fairies
to
be
met
with
there
the
most
severe
attack
upon
the
fairy
pictures
seems
to
have
been
that
of
major
the
famous
authority
upon
radium
in
the
weekly
he
said
sir
arthur
conan
doyle
takes
it
for
granted
that
these
photographs
are
real
photographs
of
fairies
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
no
evidence
has
so
far
been
put
forward
to
show
exactly
how
they
were
produced
anyone
who
has
studied
the
extraordinary
effects
which
have
from
time
to
time
been
obtained
by
cinema
operators
must
be
aware
that
it
is
possible
given
time
and
opportunity
to
produce
by
means
of
faked
photographs
almost
anything
that
can
be
imagined
it
is
well
to
point
out
that
the
elder
of
the
two
girls
has
been
described
by
her
mother
as
a
most
imaginative
child
who
has
been
in
the
habit
of
drawing
fairies
for
years
and
who
for
a
time
was
apprenticed
to
a
firm
of
photographers
in
addition
to
this
she
has
access
to
some
of
the
most
beautiful
dales
and
valleys
where
the
imagination
of
a
young
person
is
easily
quickened
one
of
the
pictures
represents
the
younger
child
leaning
on
her
elbow
upon
a
bank
while
a
number
of
fairies
are
shown
dancing
around
her
the
child
does
not
look
at
the
fairies
but
is
posing
for
the
photograph
in
the
ordinary
way
the
reason
given
for
her
apparent
disinterestedness
in
the
frolicsome
elves
is
that
she
is
used
to
the
fairies
and
was
merely
interested
in
the
camera
the
picture
in
question
could
be
in
two
ways
either
the
little
figures
of
the
fairies
were
stuck
upon
a
cardboard
cut
out
and
placed
close
to
the
sitter
when
of
course
she
would
not
be
able
to
see
them
and
the
whole
photograph
produced
on
a
marked
plate
or
the
original
photograph
without
may
have
had
stuck
on
it
the
figures
of
fairies
cut
from
some
publication
this
would
then
be
rephotographed
and
if
well
done
no
photographer
could
swear
that
the
second
negative
was
not
the
original
one
major
went
on
to
remark
that
great
weight
had
been
placed
upon
the
fact
that
the
fairies
in
the
photograph
had
transparent
wings
but
that
a
tricky
photographer
could
very
easily
reproduce
such
an
effect
is
quite
possible
he
observed
cut
off
the
transparent
wings
of
insects
and
paste
them
on
a
picture
of
fairies
it
is
easy
to
add
the
transparent
wings
of
large
flies
and
so
arrange
them
that
portions
of
the
photograph
can
be
viewed
through
the
wings
and
thus
obtain
a
very
realistic
effect
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
although
the
are
represented
as
if
they
were
dancing
in
fact
they
are
definitely
stated
to
be
dancing
there
is
no
evidence
of
movement
in
the
photographs
an
explanation
of
this
has
been
given
by
the
photographer
herself
who
has
told
us
that
the
movements
of
the
fairies
are
exceedingly
slow
and
might
be
compared
to
the
films
shown
in
the
cinemas
this
proves
that
the
young
lady
possesses
a
very
considerable
knowledge
of
photography
millions
of
photographs
have
been
taken
by
operators
of
different
ages
children
and
of
country
scenes
and
places
which
we
have
been
taught
are
the
habitats
of
nymphs
and
elves
yet
until
the
arrival
upon
the
scene
of
these
two
wonderful
children
the
image
of
a
fairy
has
never
been
produced
on
a
photographic
plate
on
the
evidence
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
these
photographs
could
have
been
i
criticize
the
attitude
of
those
who
declared
there
is
something
supernatural
in
the
circumstances
attending
the
taking
of
these
pictures
because
as
a
medical
man
i
believe
that
the
inculcation
of
such
absurd
ideas
into
the
minds
of
children
will
result
in
later
life
in
manifestations
of
nervous
disorder
and
mental
disturbances
surely
young
children
can
be
brought
up
to
appreciate
the
beauties
of
nature
without
their
imagination
being
filled
with
exaggerated
if
picturesque

misplaced
sentiment

this

answered
major
says
evidence
has
been
put
forward
to
show
how
they
were
produced
the
least
a
critic
should
do
is
surely
to
read
the
report
of
the
case
sir
conan
doyle
is
asserted
to
have
taken
it
granted
that
these
photographs
are
real
and
genuine
it
would
be
difficult
to
misrepresent
the
case
more
completely
the
negatives
and
contact
prints
were
submitted
to
the
most
searching
tests
known
to
photographic
science
by
experts
many
of
whom
were
frankly
sceptical
they
emerged
as
being
unquestionably
plates
and
further
as
bearing
no
evidence
whatever
in
themselves
of
any
trace
of
the
innumerable
faking
devices
known
this
did
not
clear
them
entirely
for
as
i
have
always
remarked
in
my
description
of
the
investigation
it
is
held
possible
by
employing
highly
artistic
and
skilled
processes
to
produce
similar
negatives
personally
i
should
very
much
like
to
see
this
attempted
seriously
the
few
that
have
been
done
though
very
much
better
than
the
crude
examples
major
submits
break
down
hopelessly
on
simple
analysis
the
case
resolved
itself
at
an
early
stage
into
the
examination
of
the
personal
element
and
the
motive
for
faked
work
it
was
this
that
occupied
us
so
strenuously
for
we
fully
realized
the
imperative
need
of
overwhelmingly
satisfying
proof
of
personal
integrity
before
accepting
the
photographs
as
genuine
this
was
carried
through
and
its
thoroughness
may
be
estimated
by
the
fact
that
notwithstanding
the
searching
nature
of
the
investigation
that
has
followed
the
publication
of
the
village
names
nothing
even
modifies
my
first
report
i
need
hardly
point
out
that
the
strength
of
the
case
lies
in
its
amazing
simplicity
and
the
integrity
of
the
family
concerned
it
is
on
the
photographic
plus
the
personal
evidence
that
the
case
stands
into
part
of
the
criticism
advanced
by
major
it
will
be
kinder
perhaps
not
to
enter
seriously
to
suggest
that
a
visit
to
a
cinema
show
and
the
use
of
an
apt
illustration
implies
very
considerable
knowledge
of
photography
is
on
a
par
with
the
supposition
that
to
be
employed
as
an
errand
girl
and
help
in
a
shop
indicates
a
high
degree
of
skill
in
that
profession
we
are
not
quite
so
credulous
as
that
nor
were
we
able
to
believe
that
two
children
alone
and
unaided
could
produce
in
half
an
hour
a
faked
photograph
of
the
type
of
and
the
fairies
in
addition
to
this
criticism
by
major
there
came
an
attack
in
o
from
the
distinguished
writer
maurice
hewlett
who
raises
some
objections
which
were
answered
in
gardner
subsequent
reply
hewlett
contention
was
as
follows
the
stage
which
sir
conan
doyle
has
reached
at
present
is
one
of
belief
in
the
genuineness
of
what
one
may
call
the
carpenter
photographs
which
showed
the
other
day
to
the
readers
of
the
two
ordinary
girls
in
familiar
intercourse
with
winged
beings
as
near
as
i
can
judge
about
eighteen
inches
high
if
he
believes
in
the
photographs
two
inferences
can
be
made
so
to
speak
to
stand
up
one
that
he
must
believe
also
in
the
existence
of
the
beings
two
that
a
mechanical
operation
where
human
agency
has
done
nothing
but
prepare
a
plate
focus
an
object
press
a
button
and
print
a
picture
has
rendered
visible
something
which
is
not
otherwise
visible
to
the
common
naked
eye
that
is
really
all
sir
arthur
has
to
tell
us
he
believes
the
photographs
to
be
genuine
the
rest
follows
but
why
does
he
believe
it
because
the
young
ladies
tell
him
that
they
are
genuine
alas
sir
arthur
can
not
he
tells
us
go
into
yorkshire
himself
to
the
young
ladies
even
if
he
wishes
to
them
which
does
not
appear
however
he
sends
in
his
place
a
friend
gardner
also
of
hospitable
mind
with
settled
opinions
upon
theosophy
and
kindred
subjects
but
deficient
it
would
seem
in
logical
faculty
gardner
has
himself
photographed
in
the
place
where
the
young
ladies
photographed
each
other
or
thereabouts
no
winged
beings
circled
about
him
and
one
wonders
why
gardner
was
photographed
reproduced
the
photograph
in
the
the
only
answer
i
can
find
is
suggested
to
me
by
the
appearance
of
the
virgin
and
child
to
certain
shepherds
in
a
at
verona
the
shepherds
told
their
parish
priest
that
the
virgin
mary
had
indeed
appeared
to
them
on
a
moonlit
night
had
accepted
a
bowl
of
milk
from
them
had
then
picked
a
peach
from
one
of
the
trees
and
eaten
it
the
priest
visited
the
spot
in
their
company
and
in
due
course
picked
up
a
that
settled
it
obviously
the
madonna
had
been
really
there
for
here
was
the
to
prove
it
i
am
driven
to
the
conclusion
that
gardner
had
himself
photographed
on
a
particular
spot
in
order
to
prove
the
genuineness
of
former
photographs
taken
there
the
argument
would
run
the
photographs
were
taken
on
a
certain
spot
but
i
have
been
myself
photographed
on
that
spot
therefore
the
photographs
were
genuine
there
is
a
fallacy
lurking
but
it
is
a
hospitable
fallacy
and
luckily
it
does
very
much
matter
the
line
to
take
about
a
question
of
the
sort
is
undoubtedly
that
of
least
resistance
which
is
the
harder
of
belief
the
faking
of
a
photograph
or
the
objective
existence
of
winged
beings
eighteen
inches
high
undoubtedly
to
a
plain
man
the
latter
but
assume
the
former
if
such
beings
exist
if
they
are
occasionally
visible
and
if
a
camera
is
capable
of
revealing
to
all
the
world
what
is
hidden
from
most
people
in
it
we
are
not
yet
able
to
say
that
the
carpenter
photographs
are
photographs
of
such
beings
for
we
observe
have
not
seen
such
beings
true
but
we
have
all
seen
photographs
of
beings
in
rapid
motion
horses
racing
greyhounds
coursing
a
hare
men
running
over
a
field
and
so
on
we
have
seen
pictures
of
these
things
and
we
have
seen
photographs
of
them
and
the
odd
thing
is
that
never
never
by
any
chance
does
the
photograph
of
a
running
object
in
the
least
resemble
a
picture
of
it
the
horse
dog
or
man
in
fact
in
the
photograph
does
not
look
to
be
in
motion
at
all
and
rightly
so
because
in
the
instant
of
being
photographed
was
not
in
so
infinitely
rapid
is
the
action
of
light
on
the
plate
that
it
is
possible
to
isolate
a
fraction
of
time
in
a
rapid
flight
and
to
record
it
directly
you
combine
a
series
of
photographs
in
sequence
and
set
them
moving
you
have
a
semblance
of
motion
exactly
like
that
which
you
have
in
a
picture
now
the
beings
circling
round
a
girl
head
and
shoulders
in
the
carpenter
photograph
are
in
and
not
in
photographic
flight
that
is
certain
they
are
in
the
approved
pictorial
or
plastic
convention
of
dancing
they
are
not
well
rendered
by
any
means
they
are
stiff
compared
with
let
us
say
the
whirling
gnomes
on
the
outside
wrapper
of
they
have
very
little
of
the
wild
irresponsible
vagary
of
a
butterfly
but
they
are
an
attempt
to
render
an
aerial
dance
pretty
enough
in
a
small
way
the
photographs
are
too
small
to
enable
me
to
decide
whether
they
are
painted
on
cardboard
or
modelled
in
the
round
the
figures
are
not
one
other
point
which
may
be
called
a
small
one
but
in
a
matter
of
the
sort
no
point
is
a
small
one
i
regard
it
as
a
certainty
as
the
other
plainly
is
if
the
dancing
figures
had
been
dancing
beings
really
there
the
child
in
the
photograph
would
have
been
looking
at
them
not
at
the
camera
i
know
children
and
knowing
children
and
knowing
that
sir
arthur
conan
doyle
has
legs
i
decide
that
the
miss
carpenters
have
pulled
one
of
them
meantime
i
suggest
to
him
that
epochs
are
born
not
made
to
which
gardner
replied
in
the
following
issue
i
could
have
wished
that
maurice
hewlett
somewhat
playful
criticism
of
the
genuineness
of
the
photographs
of
fairies
appearing
in
the
christmas
number
had
been
more
clearly
defined
the
only
serious
point
raised
is
the
difference
between
photographic
and
pictorial
representation
of
motion
hewlett
maintaining
that
the
latter
is
in
evidence
in
the
photographs
with
regard
to
the
separate
photographs
of
the
sites
surely
the
reason
for
their
inclusion
is
obvious
photographic
experts
had
stated
that
though
the
two
negatives
revealed
no
trace
of
any
faking
process
such
as
double
exposure
painted
figures
on
enlargements
rephotographed
models
in
card
or
other
material
still
it
could
not
be
held
to
be
impossible
to
obtain
the
same
class
of
result
by
very
clever
studio
work
also
certain
points
that
needed
elucidation
were
the
haze
above
and
at
the
side
of
the
head
and
the
blurred
appearance
of
the
waterfall
as
compared
with
the
clarity
of
the
figures
etc
an
inspection
of
the
spots
and
photographs
of
their
surroundings
was
surely
the
only
way
to
clear
up
some
of
these
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
waterfall
proved
to
be
about
twenty
feet
behind
the
child
and
hence
out
of
focus
and
some
large
rocks
at
the
same
distance
in
the
rear
at
the
side
of
the
fall
were
found
to
be
the
cause
of
the
haziness
the
separate
photographs
of
which
only
one
is
published
of
each
place
confirm
entirely
the
genuineness
of
the
sites
not
the
genuineness
of
the
fairies
in
commenting
on
the
photography
of
a
moving
object
hewlett
makes
the
astonishing
statement
that
at
the
instant
of
being
photographed
is
not
in
italics
i
wonder
when
it
is
and
what
would
happen
if
a
camera
was
exposed
then
of
course
the
moving
object
is
in
motion
during
exposure
no
matter
whether
the
time
be
a
fiftieth
or
a
millionth
part
of
a
second
though
hewlett
is
by
no
means
the
only
one
to
fall
into
this
error
and
each
of
the
fairy
figures
in
the
negative
discloses
signs
of
movement
this
was
one
of
the
first
points
determined
i
admit
at
once
of
course
that
this
does
not
meet
the
criticism
that
the
fairies
display
much
more
grace
in
action
than
is
to
be
found
in
the
ordinary
snapshot
of
a
moving
horse
or
man
but
if
we
are
here
dealing
with
fairies
whose
bodies
must
be
presumed
to
be
of
a
purely
ethereal
and
plastic
nature
and
not
with
mammals
at
all
is
it
such
a
very
illogical
mind
that
accepts
the
exquisite
grace
therein
found
as
a
natural
quality
that
is
never
absent
in
view
of
the
overwhelming
evidence
of
genuineness
now
in
hand
this
seems
to
be
the
truth
with
regard
to
the
last
query
raised
the
child
looking
at
the
camera
instead
of
at
the
fairies
alice
was
entirely
unsophisticated
respecting
the
proper
photographic
attitude
for
her
cameras
were
much
more
novel
than
fairies
and
never
before
had
she
seen
one
used
so
close
to
her
strange
to
us
as
it
may
seem
at
the
moment
it
interested
her
the
most
apropos
would
a
faker
clever
enough
to
produce
such
a
photograph
commit
the
elementary
blunder
of
not
posing
his
subject
among
other
interesting
and
weighty
opinions
which
were
in
general
agreement
with
our
contentions
was
one
by
staddon
of
goodmayes
a
gentleman
who
had
made
a
particular
hobby
of
fakes
in
photography
his
report
is
too
long
and
too
technical
for
inclusion
but
under
the
various
headings
of
composition
dress
development
density
lighting
poise
texture
plate
atmosphere
focus
halation
he
goes
very
completely
into
the
evidence
coming
to
the
final
conclusion
that
when
tried
by
all
these
tests
the
chances
are
not
less
than
per
cent
in
favour
of
authenticity
it
may
be
added
that
in
the
course
of
exhibiting
these
photographs
in
the
interests
of
the
theosophical
bodies
with
which
gardner
is
connected
it
has
sometimes
occurred
that
the
plates
have
been
enormously
magnified
upon
the
screen
in
one
instance
at
wakefield
the
powerful
lantern
used
threw
an
exceptionally
large
picture
on
a
huge
sheet
the
operator
a
very
intelligent
man
who
had
taken
a
sceptical
attitude
was
entirely
converted
to
the
truth
of
the
photographs
for
as
he
pointed
out
such
an
enlargement
would
show
the
least
trace
of
a
scissors
irregularity
or
of
any
artificial
detail
and
would
make
it
absurd
to
suppose
that
a
dummy
figure
could
remain
undetected
the
lines
were
always
beautifully
fine
and
unbroken
chapter
iv
the
second
series
when
gardner
was
in
yorkshire
in
july
he
left
a
good
camera
with
elsie
for
he
learned
that
her
cousin
frances
was
about
to
visit
her
again
and
that
there
would
be
a
chance
of
more
photographs
one
of
our
difficulties
has
been
that
the
associated
aura
of
the
two
girls
is
needful
this
joining
of
auras
to
produce
a
stronger
effect
than
either
can
get
singly
is
common
enough
in
psychic
matters
we
wished
to
make
full
use
of
the
combined
power
of
the
girls
in
august
my
last
words
to
gardner
therefore
before
starting
for
australia
were
that
i
should
open
no
letter
more
eagerly
than
that
which
would
tell
me
the
result
of
our
new
venture
in
my
heart
i
hardly
expected
success
for
three
years
had
passed
and
i
was
well
aware
that
the
processes
of
puberty
are
often
fatal
to
psychic
power
i
was
surprised
therefore
as
well
as
delighted
when
i
had
his
letter
at
melbourne
informing
me
of
complete
success
and
enclosing
three
more
wonderful
prints
all
taken
in
the
fairy
glen
any
doubts
which
had
remained
in
my
mind
as
to
honesty
were
completely
overcome
for
it
was
clear
that
these
pictures
specially
the
one
of
the
fairies
in
the
bush
were
altogether
beyond
the
possibility
of
fake
even
now
however
having
a
wide
experience
of
transference
of
pictures
in
psychic
photography
and
the
effect
of
thought
upon
ectoplasmic
images
i
feel
that
there
is
a
possible
alternative
explanation
in
this
direction
and
i
have
never
quite
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
it
is
a
curious
coincidence
that
so
unique
an
event
should
have
happened
in
a
family
some
members
of
which
were
already
inclined
to
occult
study
and
might
be
imagined
to
have
formed
of
occult
appearances
such
suppositions
though
not
to
be
entirely
dismissed
are
as
it
seems
to
me
and
remote
here
is
the
joyous
letter
which
reached
me
at
melbourne
my
dear
doyle
greetings
and
best
wishes
your
last
words
to
me
before
we
parted
were
that
you
would
open
my
letter
with
the
greatest
interest
you
will
not
be
disappointed
for
the
wonderful
thing
has
happened
i
have
received
from
elsie
three
more
negatives
taken
a
few
days
back
i
need
not
describe
them
for
enclosed
are
the
three
prints
in
a
separate
envelope
the
flying
fairy
and
the
fairies
bower
are
the
most
amazing
that
any
modern
eye
has
ever
seen
surely
i
received
these
plates
on
friday
morning
last
and
have
since
been
thinking
furiously
a
nice
little
letter
came
with
them
saying
how
sorry
they
were
that
they
could
send
more
but
the
weather
had
been
bad
it
has
been
abominably
cold
and
on
only
two
afternoons
had
elsie
and
frances
been
able
to
visit
the
glen
frances
has
now
returned
to
scarborough
at
the
call
of
school
all
quite
simple
and
straightforward
and
concluding
with
the
hope
that
i
might
be
able
to
spend
another
day
with
them
at
the
end
of
this
month
i
went
over
to
harrow
at
once
and
snelling
without
hesitation
pronounced
the
three
as
bearing
the
same
proofs
of
genuineness
as
the
first
two
declaring
further
that
at
any
rate
the
bower
one
was
utterly
beyond
any
possibility
of
faking
while
on
this
point
i
might
add
that
i
have
interviewed
illingworth
people
and
somewhat
to
my
surprise
they
endorsed
this
view
now
if
you
have
not
yet
opened
the
envelope
please
do
so
and
i
will
continue
i
am
going
to
yorkshire
on
the
inst
to
fill
some
lecture
engagements
and
shall
spend
a
day
at
and
of
course
take
photos
of
these
spots
and
examine
and
take
away
any
spoilt
negatives
that
will
serve
as
useful
accompaniments
the
bower
negative
by
the
way
the
girls
simply
could
not
understand
at
all
they
saw
the
fairy
to
the
right
and
without
waiting
to
get
in
the
picture
elsie
pushed
the
camera
close
up
to
the
tall
grasses
and
took
the
snap
to
this
letter
i
made
answer
as
follows
october
dear
gardner
my
heart
was
gladdened
when
out
here
in
far
australia
i
had
your
note
and
the
three
wonderful
prints
which
are
confirmatory
of
our
published
results
you
and
i
needed
no
confirmation
but
the
whole
line
of
thought
will
be
so
novel
to
the
ordinary
busy
man
who
has
not
followed
psychic
inquiry
that
he
will
need
that
it
be
repeated
again
and
yet
again
before
he
realizes
that
this
new
order
of
life
is
really
established
and
has
to
be
taken
into
serious
account
just
as
the
pigmies
of
central
africa
i
felt
guilty
when
i
laid
a
mine
and
left
the
country
leaving
you
to
face
the
consequences
of
the
explosion
you
knew
however
that
it
was
unavoidable
i
rejoice
now
that
you
should
have
this
complete
shield
against
those
attacks
which
will
very
likely
take
the
form
of
a
clamour
for
further
pictures
unaware
that
such
pictures
actually
exist
the
matter
does
not
bear
directly
upon
the
more
vital
question
of
our
own
fate
and
that
of
those
we
have
lost
which
has
brought
me
out
here
but
anything
which
extends
man
mental
horizon
and
proves
to
him
that
matter
as
we
have
known
it
is
not
really
the
limit
of
our
universe
must
have
a
good
effect
in
breaking
down
materialism
and
leading
human
thought
to
a
broader
and
more
spiritual
level
it
almost
seems
to
me
that
those
wise
entities
who
are
conducting
this
campaign
from
the
other
side
and
using
some
of
us
as
humble
instruments
have
recoiled
before
that
sullen
stupidity
against
which
goethe
said
the
gods
themselves
fight
in
vain
and
have
opened
up
an
entirely
new
line
of
advance
which
will
turn
that
religious
and
essentially
irreligious
position
which
has
helped
to
bar
our
way
they
ca
destroy
fairies
by
antediluvian
texts
and
when
once
fairies
are
admitted
other
psychic
phenomena
will
find
a
more
ready
acceptance
my
dear
gardner
i
am
proud
to
have
been
associated
with
you
in
this
incident
we
have
had
continued
messages
at
seances
for
some
time
that
a
visible
sign
was
coming
through
and
perhaps
this
was
what
is
meant
the
human
race
does
not
deserve
fresh
evidence
since
it
has
not
troubled
as
a
rule
to
examine
that
which
already
exists
however
our
friends
beyond
are
very
and
more
charitable
than
i
for
i
will
confess
that
my
soul
is
filled
with
a
cold
contempt
for
the
indifference
and
the
moral
cowardice
which
i
see
around
me
yours
sincerely
arthur
conan
doyle
the
next
letters
from
gardner
told
me
that
in
september
immediately
after
this
second
series
was
taken
he
had
gone
north
again
and
came
away
more
convinced
than
ever
of
the
honesty
of
the
whole
wright
family
and
of
the
genuine
nature
of
the
photographs
from
this
letter
i
take
the
following
extracts
my
visit
to
yorkshire
was
very
profitable
i
spent
the
whole
day
with
the
family
and
took
photographs
of
the
new
sites
which
proved
to
be
in
close
proximity
to
the
others
i
enclose
a
few
prints
of
these
it
was
beside
the
pond
shown
that
the
or
bower
photograph
was
taken
the
fairy
that
is
in
the
air
was
leaping
rather
than
flying
it
had
leapt
up
from
the
bush
below
five
or
six
times
elsie
said
and
seemed
to
hover
at
the
top
of
its
spring
it
was
about
the
fifth
time
that
it
did
so
that
she
snapped
the
shutter
unfortunately
frances
thought
the
fairy
was
leaping
on
to
her
face
the
action
was
so
vigorous
and
tossed
her
head
back
the
motion
can
be
detected
in
the
print
the
fairy
who
is
looking
at
elsie
in
the
other
photograph
is
holding
a
bunch
of
fairy
harebells
i
thought
this
one
had
hair
and
was
altogether
quite
in
the
fashion
her
dress
is
so
but
elsie
says
her
hair
was
not
bobbed
with
regard
to
the
elsie
tells
me
they
both
saw
the
fairy
on
the
right
and
the
sprite
on
the
left
but
not
the
bower
or
rather
she
says
there
was
only
a
wreath
of
faint
mist
in
between
and
she
could
make
nothing
of
it
we
have
now
succeeded
in
bringing
this
print
out
splendidly
and
as
i
can
get
certificates
from
experts
giving
the
opinion
that
this
negative
could
not
possibly
be
we
seem
to
be
on
perfectly
safe
ground
the
exposure
times
in
each
case
were
of
a
second
the
distance
about
three
to
four
feet
the
camera
was
the
selected
that
i
had
sent
to
elsie
and
the
plates
were
of
those
that
i
had
sent
too
the
colours
of
dresses
and
wings
i
have
complete
but
will
post
these
particulars
on
when
writing
at
length
a
little
later
and
have
the
above
more
fully
written
out
the
photographs
when
i
was
in
yorkshire
in
september
investigating
the
second
series
i
took
photos
of
the
spots
of
course
and
the
full
account
of
the
success
the
children
only
had
two
brief
hours
or
so
of
decent
sunshine
during
the
whole
of
that
fortnight
they
were
together
in
august
on
the
thursday
they
took
two
and
on
the
saturday
one
if
it
had
been
normal
weather
we
might
have
obtained
a
score
or
more
possibly
however
it
is
better
to
go
slowly
though
i
propose
we
take
the
matter
further
again
in
may
or
june
the
camera
i
had
sent
was
the
one
used
and
also
the
plates
which
had
all
been
marked
privately
by
the
illingworth
independently
of
me
the
three
new
fairy
negatives
proved
to
be
of
these
and
can
be
certified
so
to
be
by
the
manager
the
cradle
or
bower
negative
is
as
i
think
i
told
you
declared
to
be
utterly
unfakeable
and
i
can
get
statements
to
this
effect
in
a
subsequent
fuller
account
gardner
says
on
thursday
afternoon
august
a
fairly
bright
and
sunny
day
fortunately
for
the
unseasonably
cold
weather
experienced
generally
could
hardly
have
been
worse
for
the
task
a
number
of
photographs
were
taken
and
again
on
saturday
august
the
three
reproduced
here
are
the
most
striking
and
amazing
of
the
number
i
only
wish
every
reader
could
see
the
superlatively
beautiful
enlargements
made
directly
from
the
actual
negatives
the
exquisite
grace
of
the
flying
fairy
baffles
description
all
fairies
indeed
seem
to
be
in
miniature
the
next
of
the
fairy
offering
a
flower
an
etheric
harebell
to
iris
is
a
model
of
gentle
and
dignified
pose
but
it
is
to
the
third
that
i
would
draw
special
and
detailed
attention
never
before
or
otherwhere
surely
has
a
bower
been
photographed
the
central
ethereal
cocoon
shape
something
between
a
cocoon
and
an
open
chrysalis
in
appearance
lightly
suspended
amid
the
grasses
is
the
bower
or
cradle
seated
on
the
upper
edge
with
wing
well
displayed
is
an
undraped
fairy
apparently
considering
whether
it
is
time
to
get
up
an
earlier
riser
of
more
mature
age
is
seen
on
the
right
possessing
abundant
hair
and
wonderful
wings
her
slightly
denser
body
can
be
glimpsed
within
her
fairy
dress
just
beyond
still
on
the
right
is
the
head
of
a
mischievous
but
smiling
elf
wearing
a
cap
on
the
extreme
left
is
a
sprite
with
a
pair
of
very
diaphanous
wings
while
just
above
rather
badly
out
of
focus
however
is
another
with
wings
still
widely
extended
and
with
outspread
arms
apparently
just
alighting
on
the
grass
tops
the
face
in
half
profile
can
just
be
traced
in
a
very
clear
and
carefully
toned
print
that
i
have
altogether
perhaps
this
of
the
bower
is
the
most
astonishing
and
interesting
of
the
more
successful
photographs
though
some
may
prefer
the
marvellous
grace
of
the
flying
figure
the
comparative
lack
of
definition
in
this
photograph
is
probably
accounted
for
by
the
absence
of
the
much
denser
human
element
to
introduce
us
in
this
way
directly
to
a
charming
bower
of
the
fairies
was
quite
an
unexpected
result
on
the
part
of
the
girls
by
the
way
they
saw
the
somewhat
sedate
fairy
on
the
right
in
the
long
grasses
and
making
no
attempt
this
time
to
get
in
the
picture
themselves
iris
put
the
camera
very
close
up
and
obtained
the
snap
it
was
simply
good
fortune
that
the
bower
was
close
by
in
showing
me
the
negative
iris
only
remarked
it
as
being
a
quaint
little
picture
that
she
could
not
make
out
there
the
matter
stands
and
nothing
has
occurred
from
that
time
onwards
to
shake
the
validity
of
the
photographs
we
were
naturally
desirous
of
obtaining
more
and
in
august
the
girls
were
brought
together
once
again
and
the
very
best
photographic
equipment
including
a
stereoscopic
camera
and
a
cinema
camera
were
placed
at
their
disposal
the
fates
however
were
most
unkind
and
a
combination
of
circumstances
stood
in
the
way
of
success
there
was
only
a
fortnight
during
which
frances
could
be
at
cottingley
and
it
was
a
fortnight
of
almost
incessant
rain
the
long
drought
breaking
at
the
end
of
july
in
yorkshire
in
addition
a
small
seam
of
coal
had
been
found
in
the
fairy
glen
and
it
had
been
greatly
polluted
by
human
magnetism
these
conditions
might
perhaps
have
been
overcome
but
the
chief
impediment
of
all
was
the
change
in
the
girls
the
one
through
womanhood
and
the
other
through
education
there
was
one
development
however
which
is
worth
recording
although
they
were
unable
to
materialize
the
images
to
such
an
extent
as
to
catch
them
upon
a
plate
the
girls
had
not
lost
their
clairvoyant
powers
and
were
able
as
of
old
to
see
the
sprites
and
elves
which
still
abounded
in
the
glen
the
sceptic
will
naturally
say
that
we
have
only
their
own
word
for
that
but
this
is
not
so
gardner
had
a
friend
whom
i
will
call
mr
sergeant
who
held
a
commission
in
the
tank
corps
in
the
war
and
is
an
honourable
gentleman
with
neither
the
will
to
deceive
nor
any
conceivable
object
in
doing
so
this
gentleman
has
long
had
the
enviable
gift
of
clairvoyance
in
a
very
high
degree
and
it
occurred
to
gardner
that
we
might
use
him
as
a
check
upon
the
statements
of
the
girls
with
great
good
humour
he
sacrificed
a
week
of
his
scanty
holiday
for
he
is
a
man
in
this
curious
manner
but
the
results
seem
to
have
amply
repaid
him
i
have
before
me
his
reports
which
are
in
the
form
of
notes
made
as
he
actually
watched
the
phenomena
recorded
the
weather
was
as
stated
bad
on
the
whole
though
clearing
occasionally
seated
with
the
girls
he
saw
all
that
they
saw
and
more
for
his
powers
proved
to
be
considerably
greater
having
distinguished
a
psychic
object
he
would
point
in
the
direction
and
ask
them
for
a
description
which
he
always
obtained
correctly
within
the
limit
of
their
powers
the
whole
glen
according
to
his
account
was
swarming
with
many
forms
of
elemental
life
and
he
saw
not
only
wood
elves
gnomes
and
goblins
but
the
rarer
undines
floating
over
the
stream
i
take
a
long
extract
from
his
rather
disjointed
notes
which
may
form
a
separate
chapter
chapter
v
observations
of
a
clairvoyant
in
the
cottingley
glen
august
and
in
the
field
we
saw
figures
about
the
size
of
the
gnome
they
were
making
weird
faces
and
grotesque
contortions
at
the
group
one
in
particular
took
great
delight
in
knocking
his
knees
together
these
forms
appeared
to
elsie
singly
one
dissolving
and
another
appearing
in
its
place
i
however
saw
them
in
a
group
with
one
figure
more
prominently
visible
than
the
rest
elsie
saw
also
a
gnome
like
the
one
in
the
photograph
but
not
so
bright
and
not
coloured
i
saw
a
group
of
female
figures
playing
a
game
somewhat
resembling
the
children
game
of
oranges
and
lemons
they
played
in
a
ring
the
game
resembled
the
grand
chain
in
the
lancers
one
fairy
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
ring
more
or
less
motionless
while
the
remainder
who
appeared
to
be
decked
with
flowers
and
to
show
colours
not
normally
their
own
danced
round
her
some
joined
hands
and
made
an
archway
for
the
others
who
moved
in
and
out
as
in
a
maze
i
noticed
that
the
result
of
the
game
appeared
to
be
the
forming
of
a
vortex
of
force
which
streamed
upwards
to
an
apparent
distance
of
four
or
five
feet
above
the
ground
i
also
noticed
that
in
those
parts
of
the
field
where
the
grass
was
thicker
and
darker
there
appeared
to
be
a
correspondingly
extra
activity
among
the
fairy
creatures
in
the
beck
itself
near
the
large
rock
at
a
slight
fall
in
the
water
i
saw
a
water
sprite
it
was
an
entirely
nude
female
figure
with
long
fair
hair
which
it
appeared
to
be
combing
or
passing
through
its
fingers
i
was
not
sure
whether
it
had
any
feet
or
not
its
form
was
of
a
dazzling
rosy
whiteness
and
its
face
very
beautiful
the
arms
which
were
long
and
graceful
were
moved
with
a
motion
it
sometimes
appeared
to
be
singing
though
no
sound
was
heard
it
was
in
a
kind
of
cave
formed
by
a
projecting
piece
of
rock
and
some
moss
apparently
it
had
no
wings
and
it
moved
with
a
sinuous
almost
motion
in
a
position
its
atmosphere
and
feeling
was
quite
different
from
that
of
the
fairies
it
showed
no
consciousness
of
my
presence
and
though
i
waited
with
the
camera
in
the
hope
of
taking
it
it
did
not
detach
itself
from
the
surroundings
in
which
it
was
in
some
way
merged
under
the
old
beeches
in
the
wood
cottingley
august
two
tiny
wood
elves
came
racing
over
the
ground
past
us
as
we
sat
on
a
fallen
tree
trunk
seeing
us
they
pulled
up
short
about
five
feet
away
and
stood
regarding
us
with
considerable
amusement
but
no
fear
they
appeared
as
if
completely
covered
in
a
skin
which
shone
slightly
as
if
wet
they
had
hands
and
feet
large
and
out
of
proportion
to
their
bodies
their
legs
were
somewhat
thin
ears
large
and
pointed
upwards
being
almost
there
were
a
large
number
of
these
figures
racing
about
the
ground
their
noses
appeared
almost
pointed
and
their
mouths
wide
no
teeth
and
no
structure
inside
the
mouth
not
even
a
tongue
so
far
as
i
could
see
it
was
as
if
the
whole
were
made
up
of
a
piece
of
jelly
surrounding
them
as
an
etheric
double
surrounds
a
physical
form
is
a
greenish
light
something
like
chemical
vapour
as
frances
came
up
and
sat
within
a
foot
of
them
they
withdrew
as
if
in
alarm
a
distance
of
eight
feet
or
so
where
they
remained
apparently
regarding
us
and
comparing
notes
of
their
impressions
these
two
live
in
the
roots
of
a
huge
beech
tree
they
disappeared
through
a
crevice
into
which
they
walked
as
one
might
walk
into
a
cave
and
sank
below
the
ground
august
by
a
small
waterfall
which
threw
up
a
fine
spray
was
seen
poised
in
the
spray
a
diminutive
fairy
form
of
an
exceedingly
tenuous
nature
it
appeared
to
have
two
main
colourings
the
upper
part
of
its
body
and
aura
being
pale
violet
the
lower
portion
pale
pink
this
colouring
appeared
to
penetrate
right
through
aura
and
denser
body
the
outline
of
the
latter
merging
into
the
former
this
creature
hung
poised
its
body
curved
gracefully
backwards
its
left
arm
held
high
above
its
head
as
if
upheld
by
the
vital
force
in
the
spray
much
as
a
seagull
supports
itself
against
the
wind
it
was
as
if
lying
on
its
back
in
a
curved
position
against
the
flow
of
the
stream
it
was
human
in
shape
but
did
not
show
any
characteristics
of
sex
it
remained
motionless
in
this
position
for
some
moments
then
flashed
out
of
view
i
did
not
notice
any
wings
elves
gnomes
and
sunday
august
in
the
field
lovely
still
moonlight
evening
the
field
appears
to
be
densely
populated
with
native
spirits
of
various
kinds
a
brownie
fairies
elves
and
gnomes
he
is
rather
taller
than
the
normal
say
eight
inches
dressed
entirely
in
brown
with
facings
of
a
darker
shade
cap
almost
conical
knee
breeches
stockings
thin
ankles
and
large
pointed
feet
like
gnomes
feet
he
stands
facing
us
in
no
way
afraid
perfectly
friendly
and
much
interested
he
gazes
upon
us
with
a
curious
expression
as
of
dawning
intellect
it
is
as
if
he
were
reaching
after
something
just
beyond
his
mental
grasp
he
looks
behind
him
at
a
group
of
fairies
who
are
approaching
us
and
moves
to
one
side
as
if
to
make
way
his
mental
attitude
is
as
of
a
child
who
would
say
i
can
stand
and
watch
this
all
day
without
being
tired
he
clearly
sees
much
of
our
auras
and
is
strongly
affected
by
our
emanations
frances
sees
tiny
fairies
dancing
in
a
circle
the
figures
gradually
expanding
in
size
till
they
reached
eighteen
inches
the
ring
widening
in
proportion
elsie
sees
a
vertical
circle
of
dancing
fairies
flying
slowly
round
as
each
one
touched
the
grass
he
appeared
to
perform
a
few
quick
steps
and
then
continued
his
slow
motion
round
the
circle
the
fairies
who
are
dancing
have
long
skirts
through
which
their
limbs
can
be
seen
viewed
astrally
the
circle
is
bathed
in
golden
yellow
light
with
the
outer
edges
of
many
hues
violet
predominating
the
movement
of
the
fairies
is
reminiscent
of
that
of
the
great
wheel
at
earl
court
the
fairies
float
very
slowly
remaining
motionless
as
far
as
bodies
and
limbs
are
concerned
until
they
come
round
to
the
ground
again
there
is
a
tinkling
music
accompanying
all
this
it
appears
to
have
more
of
the
aspect
of
a
ceremony
than
a
game
frances
sees
two
fairy
figures
performing
as
if
on
the
stage
one
with
wings
one
without
their
bodies
shine
with
the
effect
of
rippling
water
in
the
sun
the
fairy
without
wings
has
bent
over
backwards
like
a
contortionist
till
its
head
touches
the
ground
while
the
winged
figure
bends
over
it
frances
sees
a
small
figure
with
a
kind
of
welsh
hat
doing
a
kind
of
dancing
by
striking
its
heel
on
the
ground
and
at
the
same
time
raising
his
hat
and
bowing
elsie
sees
a
flower
fairy
like
a
carnation
in
shape
the
head
appearing
where
the
stalk
touches
the
flower
and
the
green
sepals
forming
a
tunic
from
which
the
arms
protrude
while
the
petals
form
a
skirt
below
which
are
rather
thin
legs
it
is
tripping
across
the
grass
its
colouring
is
pink
like
a
carnation
in
a
pale
suffused
sort
of
way
written
by
the
light
of
the
moon
i
see
couples
a
foot
high
female
and
male
dancing
in
a
slow
motion
in
the
middle
of
the
field
they
appear
even
to
reverse
they
are
clothed
in
etheric
matter
and
rather
in
appearance
their
bodies
are
outlined
with
grey
light
and
show
little
detail
elsie
sees
a
small
imp
reminiscent
of
a
monkey
revolving
slowly
round
a
stalk
to
the
top
of
which
he
was
clinging
he
has
an
impish
face
and
is
looking
our
way
as
if
performing
for
our
benefit
the
brownie
appears
during
all
this
to
have
taken
upon
himself
the
duties
of
showman
i
see
what
may
be
described
as
a
fairy
fountain
about
twenty
feet
ahead
it
is
caused
by
an
uprush
of
fairy
force
from
the
ground
and
spreading
fashion
higher
into
the
air
it
is
this
was
also
seen
by
frances
monday
august
in
the
field
i
saw
three
figures
racing
from
the
field
into
the
wood
the
same
figures
previously
seen
in
the
wood
when
about
a
distance
of
ten
yards
from
the
wall
they
leapt
over
it
into
the
wood
and
disappeared
elsie
sees
in
centre
of
field
a
very
beautiful
fairy
figure
somewhat
resembling
a
figure
of
mercury
without
winged
sandals
but
has
fairy
wings
nude
light
curly
hair
kneeling
down
in
a
dark
clump
of
grass
with
its
attention
fixed
on
something
in
the
ground
it
changes
its
position
first
it
is
sitting
back
on
its
heels
and
then
it
is
rising
to
its
full
kneeling
height
much
larger
than
usual
probably
eighteen
inches
high
it
waves
its
arms
over
some
object
on
the
ground
it
has
picked
up
something
from
the
ground
as
i
think
a
baby
and
holds
it
to
its
breast
and
seems
to
be
praying
has
greek
features
and
resembles
a
greek
statue
like
a
figure
out
of
a
greek
tragedy
tuesday
august
in
the
field
by
the
light
of
a
small
photographic
lamp
elsie
sees
a
circle
of
fairies
tripping
round
hands
joined
facing
outwards
a
figure
appears
in
the
centre
of
the
ring
at
the
same
time
the
fairies
faced
inwards
a
group
of
goblins
came
running
towards
us
from
the
wood
to
within
fifteen
feet
of
us
they
differ
somewhat
from
the
wood
elves
having
more
the
look
of
gnomes
though
they
are
smaller
being
about
the
size
of
small
brownies
elsie
sees
a
beautiful
fairy
quite
near
it
is
nude
with
golden
hair
and
is
kneeling
in
the
grass
looking
this
way
with
hands
on
knees
smiling
at
us
it
has
a
very
beautiful
face
and
is
concentrating
its
gaze
on
me
this
figure
came
within
five
feet
of
us
and
after
being
described
faded
away
elsie
sees
a
kind
of
elf
who
seems
to
be
going
so
fast
that
it
blows
his
hair
back
one
can
sense
the
wind
round
him
yet
he
is
stationary
though
he
looks
to
be
busily
hurrying
along
elsie
sees
a
flight
of
little
mannikins
in
appearance
descending
slantwise
on
to
the
grass
they
form
into
two
lines
which
cross
each
other
as
they
come
down
one
line
is
coming
vertically
down
feet
touching
head
the
other
comes
across
them
shoulder
to
shoulder
on
reaching
the
ground
they
all
run
off
in
different
directions
all
serious
as
if
intent
upon
some
business
the
elves
from
the
wood
appear
to
be
chiefly
engaged
in
racing
across
the
field
though
no
other
purpose
appears
to
be
served
by
their
speed
or
presence
few
of
them
pass
near
us
without
pulling
up
to
stare
the
elves
seem
to
be
the
most
curious
of
all
the
fairy
creatures
frances
sees
three
and
calls
them
goblins
a
blue
fairy
a
fairy
with
wings
and
general
colouring
of
and
pale
pink
the
wings
are
webbed
and
marked
in
varying
colours
like
those
of
a
butterfly
the
form
is
perfectly
modelled
and
practically
nude
a
golden
star
shines
in
the
hair
the
fairy
is
a
director
though
not
apparently
with
any
band
for
the
present
there
has
suddenly
arrived
in
the
field
a
fairy
director
with
a
band
of
fairy
people
their
arrival
causes
a
bright
radiance
to
shine
in
the
field
visible
to
us
sixty
yards
away
she
is
very
autocratic
and
definite
in
her
orders
holding
unquestioned
command
they
spread
themselves
out
into
a
gradually
widening
circle
around
her
and
as
they
do
so
a
soft
glow
spreads
out
over
the
grass
they
are
actually
vivifying
and
stimulating
the
growth
in
the
field
this
is
a
moving
band
which
arrives
in
this
field
swinging
high
over
the
tree
tops
as
if
from
a
considerable
distance
inside
a
space
of
two
minutes
the
circle
has
spread
to
approximately
twelve
feet
wide
and
is
wonderfully
radiant
with
light
each
member
of
the
band
is
connected
to
the
leader
by
a
thin
stream
of
light
these
streams
are
of
different
colour
though
chiefly
yellow
deepening
to
orange
they
meet
in
the
centre
merging
in
her
aura
and
there
is
a
constant
flow
backwards
and
forwards
among
them
the
form
produced
by
this
is
something
like
an
inverted
fruit
dish
with
the
central
fairy
as
the
stem
and
the
lines
of
light
which
flow
in
a
graceful
even
curve
forming
the
sides
of
the
bowl
this
party
is
in
intense
activity
as
if
it
had
much
to
do
and
little
time
in
which
to
do
it
the
director
is
vivified
and
instructed
from
within
herself
and
appears
to
have
her
consciousness
seated
upon
a
more
subtle
plane
than
that
upon
which
she
is
working
elsie
sees
a
tall
and
stately
fairy
come
across
the
field
to
a
clump
of
harebells
it
is
carrying
in
its
arms
something
which
may
be
a
baby
fairy
wrapped
in
gauzy
substance
it
lays
this
in
the
clump
of
harebells
and
kneels
down
as
though
stroking
something
and
after
a
time
fades
away
we
catch
impressions
of
creatures
being
ridden
by
winged
figures
who
are
thin
and
bend
over
their
mounts
like
jockeys
it
is
no
known
animal
which
they
bestride
having
a
face
something
like
that
of
a
caterpillar
amongst
this
fairy
activity
which
appears
all
over
the
field
one
glimpses
an
occasional
form
walking
with
serious
mien
across
the
field
whilst
the
wood
elves
and
other
forms
run
about
amongst
their
more
seriously
employed
fairy
kind
all
three
of
us
keep
seeing
weird
creatures
as
of
elemental
essence
elsie
sees
about
a
dozen
fairies
moving
towards
us
in
a
flight
as
they
drew
near
she
remarked
with
ecstasy
upon
their
perfect
beauty
of
form
even
while
she
did
so
they
became
as
ugly
as
sin
as
if
to
give
the
lie
to
her
words
they
all
leered
at
her
and
disappeared
in
this
episode
it
may
be
that
one
contacts
a
phase
of
the
antagonism
and
dislike
which
so
many
of
the
fairy
creatures
feel
for
humans
at
this
stage
of
evolution
frances
saw
seven
wee
fairies
quite
near
weird
little
figures
lying
face
downwards
in
the
glen
frances
sees
a
fairy
as
big
as
herself
clothed
in
tights
and
a
garment
scalloped
round
the
hips
the
whole
is
and
she
has
very
large
wings
which
she
opens
above
her
head
then
she
raises
her
arms
from
her
side
up
above
her
head
and
waves
them
gracefully
in
the
air
she
has
a
very
beautiful
face
with
an
expression
as
if
inviting
frances
into
fairyland
her
hair
is
apparently
bobbed
and
her
wings
are
transparent
one
specially
beautiful
one
has
a
body
clothed
in
iridescent
shimmering
golden
light
she
has
tall
wings
each
of
which
is
almost
divided
into
upper
and
lower
portions
the
lower
portion
which
is
smaller
than
the
upper
appears
to
be
elongated
to
a
point
like
the
wings
of
certain
butterflies
she
too
is
moving
her
arms
and
fluttering
her
wings
i
can
only
describe
her
as
a
golden
wonder
she
smiles
and
clearly
sees
us
she
places
her
finger
on
her
lips
she
remains
watching
us
with
smiling
countenance
in
amongst
the
leaves
and
branches
of
the
willow
she
is
not
objectively
visible
on
the
physical
plane
she
points
with
her
right
hand
moving
it
in
a
circle
round
her
feet
and
i
see
a
number
perhaps
six
or
seven
cherubs
winged
faces
these
appear
to
be
held
in
shape
by
some
invisible
will
she
has
cast
a
fairy
spell
over
me
completely
subjugating
the
mental
principle
leaves
me
staring
in
amongst
the
leaves
and
flowers
an
creature
runs
up
the
slanting
branch
of
the
willow
from
the
ground
where
the
fairy
stands
he
is
not
a
very
pleasant
visitor
i
should
describe
him
as
distinctly
low
class
chapter
vi
independent
evidence
for
fairies
by
a
curious
coincidence
if
it
be
indeed
a
coincidence
at
the
moment
when
the
evidence
for
the
actual
existence
of
fairies
was
brought
to
my
notice
i
had
just
finished
an
article
dealing
with
the
subject
in
which
i
gave
particulars
of
a
number
of
cases
where
such
creatures
were
said
to
have
been
seen
and
showed
how
very
strong
were
the
reasons
for
supposing
that
some
such
forms
of
life
exist
i
now
reproduce
this
article
and
i
add
to
it
another
chapter
containing
fresh
evidence
which
reached
me
after
the
publication
of
the
photographs
in
the
we
are
accustomed
to
the
idea
of
amphibious
creatures
who
may
dwell
unseen
and
unknown
in
the
depths
of
the
waters
and
then
some
day
be
spied
sunning
themselves
upon
a
sandbank
whence
they
slip
into
the
unseen
once
more
if
such
appearances
were
rare
and
if
it
should
so
happen
that
some
saw
them
more
clearly
than
others
then
a
very
pretty
controversy
would
arise
for
the
sceptics
would
say
with
every
show
of
reason
our
experience
is
that
only
land
creatures
live
on
the
land
and
we
utterly
refuse
to
believe
in
things
which
slip
in
and
out
of
the
water
if
you
will
demonstrate
them
to
us
we
will
begin
to
consider
the
question
faced
by
so
reasonable
an
opposition
the
others
could
only
mutter
that
they
had
seen
them
with
their
own
eyes
but
that
they
could
not
command
their
movements
the
sceptics
would
hold
the
field
something
of
the
sort
may
exist
in
our
psychic
arrangements
one
can
well
imagine
that
there
is
a
dividing
line
like
the
water
edge
this
line
depending
upon
what
we
vaguely
call
a
higher
rate
of
vibrations
taking
the
vibration
theory
as
a
working
hypothesis
one
could
conceive
that
by
raising
or
lowering
the
rate
the
creatures
could
move
from
one
side
to
the
other
of
this
line
of
material
visibility
as
the
tortoise
moves
from
the
water
to
the
land
returning
for
refuge
to
invisibility
as
the
reptile
scuttles
back
to
the
surf
this
of
course
is
supposition
but
intelligent
supposition
based
on
the
available
evidence
is
the
pioneer
of
science
and
it
may
be
that
the
actual
solution
will
be
found
in
this
direction
i
am
alluding
now
not
to
spirit
return
where
seventy
years
of
close
observation
has
given
us
some
sort
of
certain
and
definite
laws
but
rather
to
those
fairy
and
phantom
phenomena
which
have
been
endorsed
by
so
many
ages
and
still
even
in
these
material
days
seem
to
break
into
some
lives
in
the
most
unexpected
fashion
victorian
science
would
have
left
the
world
hard
and
clean
and
bare
like
a
landscape
in
the
moon
but
this
science
is
in
truth
but
a
little
light
in
the
darkness
and
outside
that
limited
circle
of
definite
knowledge
we
see
the
loom
and
shadow
of
gigantic
and
fantastic
possibilities
around
us
throwing
themselves
continually
across
our
consciousness
in
such
ways
that
it
is
difficult
to
ignore
them
there
is
much
curious
evidence
of
varying
value
concerning
these
borderland
forms
which
come
or
go
either
in
fact
or
imagination
the
latter
most
frequently
no
doubt
and
yet
there
remains
a
residue
which
by
all
human
standards
should
point
to
occasional
fact
lest
i
should
be
too
diffuse
i
limit
myself
in
this
essay
to
the
fairies
and
passing
all
the
tradition
which
is
so
universal
and
consistent
come
down
to
some
modern
instances
which
make
one
feel
that
this
world
is
very
much
more
complex
than
we
had
imagined
and
that
there
may
be
upon
its
surface
some
very
strange
neighbours
who
will
open
up
inconceivable
lines
of
science
for
our
posterity
especially
if
it
should
be
made
easier
for
them
by
sympathy
or
other
help
to
emerge
from
the
deep
and
manifest
upon
the
margin
taking
a
large
number
of
cases
which
lie
before
me
there
are
two
points
which
are
common
to
nearly
all
of
them
one
is
that
children
claim
to
see
these
creatures
far
more
frequently
than
adults
this
may
possibly
come
from
greater
sensitiveness
of
apprehension
or
it
may
depend
upon
these
little
entities
having
less
fear
of
molestation
from
the
children
the
other
is
that
more
cases
are
recorded
in
which
they
have
been
seen
in
the
still
shimmering
hours
of
a
very
hot
day
than
at
any
other
time
the
action
of
the
sun
upon
the
brain
says
the
sceptic
possibly
and
also
possibly
not
if
it
were
a
question
of
raising
the
slower
vibrations
of
our
surroundings
one
could
imagine
that
still
silent
heat
would
be
the
very
condition
which
might
favour
such
a
change
what
is
the
mirage
of
the
desert
what
is
that
scene
of
hills
and
lakes
which
a
whole
caravan
can
see
while
it
faces
in
a
direction
where
for
a
thousand
miles
of
desert
there
is
neither
hill
nor
lake
nor
any
cloud
or
moisture
to
produce
refraction
i
can
ask
the
question
but
i
do
not
venture
to
give
an
answer
it
is
clearly
a
phenomenon
which
is
not
to
be
confused
with
the
erect
or
often
inverted
image
which
is
seen
in
a
land
of
clouds
and
of
moisture
if
the
confidence
of
children
can
be
gained
and
they
are
led
to
speak
freely
it
is
surprising
how
many
claim
to
have
seen
fairies
my
younger
family
consists
of
two
little
boys
and
one
small
girl
very
truthful
children
each
of
whom
tells
with
detail
the
exact
circumstances
and
appearance
of
the
creature
to
each
it
happened
only
once
and
in
each
case
it
was
a
single
little
figure
twice
in
the
garden
once
in
the
nursery
inquiry
among
friends
shows
that
many
children
have
had
the
same
experience
but
they
close
up
at
once
when
met
by
ridicule
and
incredulity
sometimes
the
shapes
are
unlike
those
which
they
would
have
gathered
from
fairies
are
like
nuts
and
moss
says
one
child
in
lady
glenconner
charming
study
of
family
life
my
own
children
differ
in
the
height
of
the
creatures
which
may
well
vary
but
in
their
dress
they
are
certainly
not
unlike
the
conventional
idea
which
after
all
may
also
be
the
true
one
illustration
a
view
of
the
beck
in
illustration
the
two
girls
near
the
spot
where
the
leaping
fairy
was
taken
in
there
are
many
people
who
have
a
recollection
of
these
experiences
of
their
youth
and
try
afterwards
to
explain
them
away
on
material
grounds
which
do
not
seem
adequate
or
reasonable
thus
in
his
excellent
book
on
the
rev
gives
us
a
personal
experience
which
illustrates
several
of
the
points
already
mentioned
in
the
year
he
says
when
i
was
a
small
boy
of
four
years
old
we
were
driving
to
montpelier
on
a
hot
summer
day
over
the
long
straight
road
that
traverses
a
plain
on
which
grows
nothing
save
a
few
aromatic
herbs
i
was
sitting
on
the
box
with
my
father
when
to
my
great
surprise
i
saw
legions
of
dwarfs
of
about
two
feet
high
running
along
beside
the
horses
some
sat
laughing
on
the
pole
some
were
scrambling
up
the
harness
to
get
on
the
backs
of
the
horses
i
remarked
to
my
father
what
i
saw
when
he
abruptly
stopped
the
carriage
and
put
me
inside
beside
my
mother
where
the
conveyance
being
closed
i
was
out
of
the
sun
the
effect
was
that
little
by
little
the
host
of
imps
diminished
in
number
till
they
disappeared
altogether
here
certainly
the
advocates
of
sunstroke
have
a
strong
though
by
no
means
a
final
case
next
illustration
is
a
sounder
one
when
my
wife
was
a
girl
of
fifteen
he
says
she
was
walking
down
a
lane
in
yorkshire
between
green
hedges
when
she
saw
seated
in
one
of
the
privet
hedges
a
little
green
man
perfectly
well
made
who
looked
at
her
with
his
beady
black
eyes
he
was
about
a
foot
or
fifteen
inches
high
she
was
so
frightened
that
she
ran
home
she
remembers
that
it
was
a
summer
day
a
girl
of
fifteen
is
old
enough
to
be
a
good
witness
and
her
flight
and
the
clear
detail
of
her
memory
point
to
a
real
experience
again
we
have
the
suggestion
of
a
hot
day
has
yet
a
third
case
one
day
a
son
of
mine
he
says
was
sent
into
the
garden
to
pick
for
the
cook
to
shell
for
dinner
presently
he
rushed
into
the
house
as
white
as
chalk
to
say
that
while
he
was
thus
engaged
and
standing
between
the
rows
of
peas
he
saw
a
little
man
wearing
a
red
cap
a
green
jacket
and
brown
knee
breeches
whose
face
was
old
and
wan
and
who
had
a
grey
beard
and
eyes
as
black
and
hard
as
sloes
he
stared
so
intently
at
the
boy
that
the
latter
took
to
his
heels
here
again
the
show
that
it
was
summer
and
probably
in
the
heat
of
the
day
once
again
the
detail
is
very
exact
and
corresponds
closely
as
i
shall
presently
show
to
some
independent
accounts
is
inclined
to
put
all
these
down
to
the
heat
conjuring
up
the
familiar
pictures
of
fairy
books
but
some
further
evidence
may
cause
the
reader
to
doubt
this
explanation
let
us
compare
with
these
stories
the
very
direct
evidence
of
violet
tweedale
whose
courage
in
making
public
the
result
of
her
own
remarkable
psychic
faculties
should
meet
with
recognition
from
every
student
of
the
subject
our
descendants
will
hardly
realize
the
difficulty
which
now
exists
of
getting
evidence
with
names
attached
for
they
will
have
outgrown
the
state
when
the
cry
of
fake
and
fraud
and
dupe
is
raised
at
once
against
any
observer
however
honourable
and
moderate
by
people
who
know
little
or
nothing
of
the
subject
tweedale
says
i
had
a
wonderful
little
experience
some
five
years
ago
which
proved
to
me
the
existence
of
fairies
one
summer
afternoon
i
was
walking
alone
along
the
avenue
of
lupton
house
devonshire
it
was
an
absolutely
still
day
not
a
leaf
moving
and
all
nature
seemed
to
sleep
in
the
hot
sunshine
a
few
yards
in
front
of
me
my
eye
was
attracted
by
the
violent
movements
of
a
single
long
leaf
of
a
wild
iris
this
leaf
was
swinging
and
bending
energetically
while
the
rest
of
the
plant
was
motionless
expecting
to
see
a
astride
it
i
stepped
very
softly
up
to
it
what
was
my
delight
to
see
a
tiny
green
man
he
was
about
five
inches
long
and
was
swinging
his
tiny
green
feet
which
appeared
to
be
were
crossed
over
the
leaf
and
his
hands
raised
behind
his
head
also
held
the
blade
i
had
a
vision
of
a
merry
little
face
and
something
red
in
the
form
of
a
cap
on
the
head
for
a
full
minute
he
remained
in
view
swinging
on
the
leaf
then
he
vanished
since
then
i
have
several
times
seen
a
single
leaf
moving
violently
while
the
rest
of
the
plant
remained
motionless
but
i
have
never
again
been
able
to
see
the
cause
of
the
movement
here
the
dress
of
the
fairy
green
jacket
and
red
cap
is
exactly
the
same
as
was
described
independently
by
son
and
again
we
have
the
elements
of
heat
and
stillness
it
may
be
fairly
answered
that
many
artists
have
drawn
the
fairies
in
such
a
dress
and
that
the
colours
may
in
this
way
have
been
impressed
upon
the
minds
of
both
observers
in
the
bending
iris
we
have
something
objective
however
which
can
not
easily
be
explained
away
as
a
cerebral
hallucination
and
the
whole
incident
seems
to
me
an
impressive
piece
of
evidence
a
lady
with
whom
i
have
corresponded
who
is
engaged
in
organizing
work
of
the
most
responsible
kind
has
had
an
experience
which
resembles
that
of
tweedale
my
only
sight
of
a
fairy
she
says
was
in
a
large
wood
in
west
sussex
about
nine
years
ago
he
was
a
little
creature
about
half
a
foot
high
dressed
in
leaves
the
remarkable
thing
about
his
face
was
that
no
soul
looked
through
his
eyes
he
was
playing
about
in
long
grass
and
flowers
in
an
open
space
once
again
summer
is
indicated
the
length
and
colour
of
the
creature
correspond
with
tweedale
account
while
the
lack
of
soul
in
the
eyes
may
be
compared
with
the
hard
eyes
described
by
young
one
of
the
most
gifted
clairvoyants
in
england
was
the
late
turvey
of
bournemouth
whose
book
beginnings
of
should
be
in
the
library
of
every
student
lonsdale
of
bournemouth
is
also
a
sensitive
the
latter
has
given
me
the
following
account
of
an
incident
which
he
observed
some
years
ago
in
the
presence
of
turvey
i
was
sitting
says
lonsdale
in
his
company
in
his
garden
at
branksome
park
we
sat
in
a
hut
which
had
an
open
front
looking
on
to
the
lawn
we
had
been
perfectly
quiet
for
some
time
neither
talking
nor
moving
as
was
often
our
habit
suddenly
i
was
conscious
of
a
movement
on
the
edge
of
the
lawn
which
on
that
side
went
up
to
a
grove
of
pine
trees
looking
closely
i
saw
several
little
figures
dressed
in
brown
peering
through
the
bushes
they
remained
quiet
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
disappeared
in
a
few
seconds
a
dozen
or
more
small
people
about
two
feet
in
height
in
bright
clothes
and
with
radiant
faces
ran
on
to
the
lawn
dancing
hither
and
thither
i
glanced
at
turvey
to
see
if
he
saw
anything
and
whispered
you
see
them
he
nodded
these
fairies
played
about
gradually
approaching
the
hut
one
little
fellow
bolder
than
the
others
came
to
a
croquet
hoop
close
to
the
hut
and
using
the
hoop
as
a
horizontal
bar
turned
round
and
round
it
much
to
our
amusement
some
of
the
others
watched
him
while
others
danced
about
not
in
any
set
dance
but
seemingly
moving
in
sheer
joy
this
continued
for
four
or
five
minutes
when
suddenly
evidently
in
response
to
some
signal
or
warning
from
those
dressed
in
brown
who
had
remained
at
the
edge
of
the
lawn
they
all
ran
into
the
wood
just
then
a
maid
appeared
coming
from
the
house
with
tea
never
was
tea
so
unwelcome
as
evidently
its
appearance
was
the
cause
of
the
disappearance
of
our
little
visitors
lonsdale
adds
i
have
seen
fairies
several
times
in
the
new
forest
but
never
so
clearly
as
this
here
also
the
scene
is
laid
in
the
heat
of
a
summer
day
and
the
division
of
the
fairies
into
two
different
sorts
is
remarkably
borne
out
by
the
general
descriptions
knowing
lonsdale
as
i
do
to
be
a
responsible
and
honourable
man
i
find
such
evidence
as
this
very
hard
to
put
to
one
side
here
at
least
the
sunstroke
hypothesis
is
negatived
since
both
men
sat
in
the
shade
of
the
hut
and
corroborated
the
observation
of
the
other
on
the
other
hand
each
of
the
men
like
tweedale
was
supernormal
in
psychic
development
so
that
it
might
well
happen
that
the
maid
for
example
would
not
have
seen
the
fairies
even
if
she
had
arrived
earlier
upon
the
scene
i
know
a
gentleman
belonging
to
one
of
the
learned
professions
whose
career
as
let
us
say
a
surgeon
would
not
be
helped
if
this
article
were
to
connect
him
with
fairy
lore
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
spite
of
his
solemn
avocations
and
his
practical
and
virile
character
he
seems
to
be
endowed
with
that
faculty
let
us
call
it
the
appreciation
of
higher
vibrations
which
opens
up
so
wonderful
a
door
to
its
possessor
he
claims
or
rather
he
admits
for
he
is
reticent
upon
the
subject
that
he
has
carried
this
power
of
perception
on
from
childhood
and
his
surprise
is
not
so
much
at
what
he
sees
as
at
the
failure
of
others
to
see
the
same
thing
to
show
that
it
is
not
subjective
he
tells
the
story
that
on
one
occasion
while
traversing
a
field
he
saw
a
little
creature
which
beckoned
eagerly
that
he
should
follow
he
did
so
and
presently
saw
his
guide
pointing
with
an
air
of
importance
to
the
ground
there
between
the
furrows
lay
a
flint
which
he
carried
home
with
him
as
a
souvenir
of
the
adventure
another
friend
of
mine
who
claims
to
have
the
power
of
seeing
fairies
is
tom
tyrrell
the
famous
medium
whose
clairvoyance
and
general
psychic
gifts
are
of
the
strongest
character
i
can
not
easily
forget
how
one
evening
in
a
yorkshire
hotel
a
storm
of
raps
sounding
very
much
as
if
someone
were
cracking
their
fingers
and
thumb
broke
out
around
his
head
and
how
with
his
in
one
hand
he
flapped
vigorously
with
the
other
to
warn
off
his
inopportune
visitors
in
answer
to
my
question
about
fairies
he
says
yes
i
do
see
these
little
pixies
or
fairies
i
have
seen
them
scores
of
times
but
only
in
the
woods
and
when
i
do
a
little
fasting
they
are
a
very
real
presence
to
me
what
are
they
i
can
not
say
i
can
never
get
nearer
to
the
beggars
than
four
or
five
yards
they
seem
afraid
of
me
and
then
scamper
off
up
the
trees
like
squirrels
i
dare
say
if
i
were
to
go
in
the
woods
oftener
i
would
perhaps
gain
their
confidence
more
they
are
certainly
like
human
beings
only
very
small
say
about
twelve
or
fifteen
inches
high
i
have
noticed
they
are
brown
in
colour
with
fairly
large
heads
and
ears
out
of
proportion
to
the
size
of
their
bodies
and
bandy
legs
i
am
speaking
of
what
i
see
i
have
never
come
across
any
other
clairvoyant
who
has
seen
them
though
i
have
read
that
many
do
so
probably
they
have
something
to
do
with
nature
processes
the
males
have
very
short
hair
and
the
females
have
rather
long
straight
hair
the
idea
that
these
little
creatures
are
occupied
in
consciously
furthering
nature
projects
very
much
i
suppose
as
the
bee
carries
pollen
is
repeated
by
the
learned
vanstone
who
combines
great
knowledge
of
theory
with
some
considerable
experience
though
a
high
development
of
intellect
is
in
spite
of
swedenborg
example
a
bar
to
psychic
perception
this
would
show
if
it
is
correct
that
we
may
have
to
return
to
the
classical
conception
of
something
in
the
nature
of
naiads
and
fauns
and
spirits
of
the
trees
and
groves
vanstone
whose
experiences
are
on
the
borderland
between
what
is
objective
and
what
is
sensed
without
being
actually
seen
writes
to
me
i
have
been
distinctly
aware
of
minute
intelligent
beings
in
connection
with
the
evolution
of
plant
forces
particularly
in
certain
localities
for
instance
in
ecclesbourne
glen
pond
life
yields
to
me
the
largest
and
best
sense
of
fairy
life
and
not
the
floral
world
i
may
be
only
clothing
my
subjective
consciousness
with
unreal
objective
imaginations
but
they
are
real
to
me
as
sentient
intelligent
beings
able
to
communicate
with
us
in
varying
distinctness
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
elemental
beings
are
engaged
like
factory
hands
in
facilitating
the
operation
of
nature
laws
another
gentleman
who
claims
to
have
this
most
remarkable
gift
is
tom
charman
who
builds
for
himself
a
shelter
in
the
new
forest
and
hunts
for
fairies
as
an
entomologist
would
for
butterflies
in
answer
to
my
inquiries
he
tells
me
that
the
power
of
vision
came
to
him
in
childhood
but
left
him
for
many
years
varying
in
proportion
with
his
own
nearness
to
nature
according
to
this
seer
the
creatures
are
of
many
sizes
varying
from
a
few
inches
to
several
feet
they
are
male
female
and
children
he
has
not
heard
them
utter
sounds
but
believes
that
they
do
so
of
finer
quality
than
we
can
hear
they
are
visible
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
and
show
small
lights
about
the
same
size
as
they
dress
in
all
sorts
of
ways
such
is
account
it
is
of
course
easy
for
us
who
respond
only
to
the
more
material
vibrations
to
declare
that
all
these
seers
are
or
are
the
victims
of
some
mental
twist
it
is
difficult
for
them
to
defend
themselves
from
such
a
charge
it
is
however
to
be
urged
upon
the
other
side
that
these
numerous
testimonies
come
from
people
who
are
very
solid
and
practical
and
successful
in
the
affairs
of
life
one
is
a
distinguished
writer
another
an
ophthalmic
authority
a
third
a
successful
professional
man
a
fourth
a
lady
engaged
on
public
service
and
so
on
to
waive
aside
the
evidence
of
such
people
on
the
ground
that
it
does
not
correspond
with
our
own
experience
is
an
act
of
mental
arrogance
which
no
wise
man
will
commit
it
is
interesting
to
compare
these
various
contemporary
and
accounts
of
the
impressions
which
all
these
witnesses
have
received
i
have
already
pointed
out
that
the
higher
vibrations
which
we
associate
with
hot
sunshine
and
which
we
actually
seem
to
see
in
the
shimmer
of
noontide
is
associated
with
many
of
the
episodes
apart
from
this
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
evidence
is
on
the
whole
irregular
we
have
creatures
described
which
range
from
five
inches
to
two
and
a
half
feet
an
advocate
of
the
fairies
might
say
that
since
the
tradition
has
always
been
that
they
procreate
as
human
beings
do
we
are
dealing
with
them
in
every
stage
of
growth
which
accounts
for
the
varying
size
it
seems
to
me
however
that
a
better
case
could
be
made
out
if
it
were
pleaded
that
there
have
always
been
many
different
races
of
fairyland
and
that
samples
of
these
races
may
greatly
differ
from
each
other
and
may
inhabit
varying
spots
so
that
an
observer
like
tyrrell
for
example
may
always
have
seen
woodland
elves
which
bear
no
resemblance
to
gnomes
or
goblins
the
creatures
of
my
professional
friend
which
were
over
two
feet
high
compare
very
closely
with
the
creatures
which
little
saw
climbing
on
to
the
horses
in
both
cases
these
taller
fairies
were
reported
from
flat
locations
while
the
little
type
varies
completely
from
the
dancing
little
feminine
elf
so
beloved
by
shakespeare
in
the
experience
of
turvey
and
lonsdale
two
different
types
engaged
in
different
tasks
were
actually
seen
at
the
same
moment
the
one
being
dancing
elves
while
the
other
were
the
attendants
who
guarded
them
the
claim
that
the
fairy
rings
so
often
seen
in
meadow
or
marshland
are
caused
by
the
beat
of
fairy
feet
is
certainly
untenable
as
they
unquestionably
come
from
fungi
such
as
or
which
grow
from
a
centre
continually
deserting
the
exhausted
ground
and
spreading
to
that
which
is
fresh
in
this
way
a
complete
circle
is
formed
which
may
be
quite
small
or
may
be
of
diameter
these
circles
appear
just
as
often
in
woods
from
the
same
cause
but
are
smothered
over
by
the
decayed
leaves
among
which
the
fungi
grow
but
though
the
fairies
most
certainly
do
not
produce
the
rings
it
might
be
asserted
and
could
not
be
denied
that
the
rings
once
formed
whatever
their
cause
would
offer
a
very
charming
course
for
a
circular
dance
certainly
from
all
time
these
circles
have
been
associated
with
the
gambols
of
the
little
people
after
these
modern
instances
one
is
inclined
to
read
with
a
little
more
gravity
the
account
which
our
ancestors
gave
of
these
creatures
for
however
fanciful
in
parts
it
still
may
have
had
some
core
of
truth
i
say
our
ancestors
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
shepherds
on
the
south
downs
to
this
day
who
will
throw
a
bit
of
their
bread
and
cheese
over
their
shoulders
at
for
the
little
folks
to
consume
all
over
the
united
kingdom
and
especially
in
wales
and
ireland
the
belief
is
largely
held
among
those
folks
who
are
nearest
to
nature
first
of
all
it
was
always
supposed
that
they
lived
within
the
earth
this
was
natural
enough
since
a
sudden
disappearance
of
a
solid
body
could
only
be
understood
in
that
way
on
the
whole
their
description
was
not
grotesque
and
fits
easily
into
its
place
amid
the
examples
already
given
they
were
of
small
stature
says
one
welsh
authority
quoted
in
lewes
than
towards
two
feet
in
height
and
their
horses
of
the
size
of
hares
their
clothes
were
generally
white
but
on
certain
occasions
they
have
been
seen
dressed
in
green
their
gait
was
lively
and
ardent
and
loving
was
their
glance
they
were
peaceful
and
kindly
among
themselves
diverting
in
their
tricks
and
charming
in
their
walk
and
dancing
this
mention
of
horses
is
somewhat
out
of
the
picture
but
all
the
rest
seems
corroborative
of
what
has
already
been
stated
illustration
the
photograph
from
canada
one
of
the
best
of
the
ancient
accounts
is
that
of
the
rev
kirk
who
occupied
a
parish
at
monteith
on
the
edge
of
the
highlands
and
wrote
a
pamphlet
called
secret
about
the
year
he
had
very
clear
and
definite
ideas
about
these
little
creatures
and
he
was
by
no
means
a
visionary
but
a
man
of
considerable
parts
who
was
chosen
afterwards
to
translate
the
bible
into
erse
his
information
about
fairies
tallies
very
well
with
that
of
the
welshman
quoted
above
he
slips
up
in
imagining
that
flint
are
indeed
but
otherwise
his
contentions
agree
very
well
with
our
modern
instances
they
have
tribes
and
orders
according
to
this
scottish
clergyman
they
eat
they
converse
in
a
thin
whistling
sort
of
language
they
have
children
deaths
and
burials
they
are
fond
of
frolic
dancing
they
have
a
regular
state
and
polity
with
rulers
laws
quarrels
and
even
battles
they
are
irresponsible
creatures
not
hostile
to
the
human
race
unless
they
have
reason
to
be
angry
but
even
inclined
to
be
helpful
since
some
of
them
the
brownies
are
by
universal
tradition
ready
to
aid
in
the
household
work
if
the
family
has
known
how
to
engage
their
affection
an
exactly
similar
account
comes
from
ireland
though
the
little
folk
seem
to
have
imbibed
the
spirit
of
the
island
to
the
extent
of
being
more
mercurial
and
irascible
there
are
many
cases
on
record
where
they
are
claimed
to
have
shown
their
power
and
to
have
taken
revenge
for
some
slight
in
the
of
march
as
quoted
in
irish
ghost
there
is
an
account
of
how
a
stone
which
the
fairies
claimed
having
been
built
into
a
house
the
inhabitants
were
bombarded
with
stones
by
invisible
assailants
by
day
and
night
the
missiles
hurting
no
one
but
causing
great
annoyance
these
stories
of
are
so
common
and
present
such
similar
features
in
cases
coming
from
every
part
of
the
world
that
they
may
be
accepted
as
a
recognized
preternatural
phenomenon
whether
it
be
the
fairies
or
some
other
form
of
mischievous
psychic
force
which
caused
the
bombardment
the
volume
already
quoted
gives
another
remarkable
case
where
a
farmer
having
built
a
house
upon
what
was
really
a
fairy
between
two
raths
or
fairy
mounds
was
exposed
to
such
persecution
by
noises
and
other
disturbances
that
his
family
was
at
last
driven
out
and
had
to
take
refuge
in
the
smaller
house
which
they
had
previously
occupied
this
story
is
narrated
by
a
correspondent
from
wexford
who
says
that
he
examined
the
facts
himself
examined
the
deserted
house
the
owner
and
satisfied
himself
that
there
were
two
raths
in
the
vicinity
and
that
the
house
was
in
a
between
them
i
have
particulars
of
a
case
in
west
sussex
which
is
analogous
and
which
i
have
been
able
to
trace
to
the
very
lady
to
whom
it
happened
this
lady
desired
to
make
a
and
for
this
purpose
got
some
large
boulders
from
a
field
hard
by
which
had
always
been
known
as
the
pixie
stones
and
built
them
into
her
new
rockery
one
summer
evening
this
lady
saw
a
tiny
grey
woman
sitting
on
one
of
the
boulders
the
little
creature
slipped
away
when
she
knew
that
she
had
been
observed
several
times
she
appeared
upon
the
stones
later
the
people
in
the
village
asked
if
the
stones
might
be
moved
back
to
the
field
as
they
said
they
are
the
pixie
stones
and
if
they
are
removed
from
their
place
misfortunes
will
happen
to
the
village
the
stones
were
restored
but
supposing
that
they
actually
do
exist
what
these
creatures
that
is
a
subject
upon
which
we
can
speculate
only
with
more
or
less
plausibility
david
gow
editor
of
and
a
considerable
authority
upon
psychic
matters
had
first
formed
the
opinion
that
they
were
simply
ordinary
human
spirits
seen
as
it
were
at
the
wrong
end
of
a
clairvoyant
telescope
and
therefore
very
minute
a
study
of
the
detailed
accounts
of
their
varied
experience
caused
him
to
alter
his
view
and
to
conclude
that
they
are
really
life
forms
which
have
developed
along
some
separate
line
of
evolution
and
which
for
some
morphological
reason
have
assumed
human
shape
in
the
strange
way
in
which
nature
reproduces
her
types
like
the
figures
on
the
mandrake
root
or
the
frost
ferns
upon
the
window
in
a
remarkable
book
wanderer
in
the
spirit
published
in
the
author
farnese
under
inspiration
gives
an
account
of
many
mysteries
including
that
of
fairies
what
he
says
fits
in
very
closely
with
the
facts
that
have
been
put
forward
and
goes
beyond
them
he
says
speaking
of
elementals
some
are
in
appearance
like
the
gnomes
and
elves
who
are
said
to
inhabit
mountain
caverns
such
too
are
the
fairies
whom
men
have
seen
in
lonely
and
secluded
places
some
of
these
beings
are
of
a
very
low
order
of
life
almost
like
the
higher
order
of
plants
save
that
they
possess
independent
motion
others
are
very
lively
and
full
of
grotesque
unmeaning
tricks
as
nations
advance
and
grow
more
spiritual
these
lower
forms
of
life
die
out
from
the
astral
plane
of
that
earth
sphere
and
succeeding
generations
begin
at
first
to
doubt
and
then
to
deny
that
they
ever
had
any
existence
this
is
one
plausible
way
of
explaining
the
disappearance
of
the
faun
the
dryad
the
naiad
and
all
the
creatures
which
are
alluded
to
with
such
familiarity
in
the
classics
of
greece
and
rome
one
may
well
ask
what
connection
has
this
with
the
general
scheme
of
psychic
philosophy
the
connection
is
slight
and
indirect
consisting
only
in
the
fact
that
anything
which
widens
our
conceptions
of
the
possible
and
shakes
us
out
of
our
lines
of
thought
helps
us
to
regain
our
elasticity
of
mind
and
thus
to
be
more
open
to
new
philosophies
the
fairy
question
is
infinitely
small
and
unimportant
compared
to
the
question
of
our
own
fate
and
that
of
the
whole
human
race
the
evidence
also
is
very
much
less
impressive
though
as
i
trust
i
have
shown
it
is
not
entirely
negligible
these
creatures
are
in
any
case
remote
from
us
and
their
existence
is
of
little
more
real
importance
than
that
of
strange
animals
or
plants
at
the
same
time
the
perennial
mystery
why
so
many
flowers
are
born
to
blush
unseen
and
why
nature
should
be
so
lavish
with
gifts
which
human
beings
can
not
use
would
be
solved
if
we
understood
that
there
were
other
orders
of
being
which
used
the
same
earth
and
shared
its
blessings
it
is
at
the
lowest
an
interesting
speculation
which
gives
an
added
charm
to
the
silence
of
the
woods
and
the
wilderness
of
the
moorland
chapter
vii
some
subsequent
cases
from
the
foregoing
chapter
it
will
be
clear
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
evidence
which
can
not
easily
be
brushed
aside
as
to
the
existence
of
these
little
creatures
before
the
discovery
of
the
photographs
these
various
witnesses
have
nothing
to
gain
by
their
testimony
and
it
is
not
tainted
by
any
mercenary
consideration
the
same
remark
applies
to
a
number
of
cases
which
were
communicated
to
me
after
the
appearance
of
the
articles
in
the
one
or
two
were
more
or
less
ingenious
practical
jokes
but
from
the
others
i
have
selected
some
which
appear
to
be
altogether
reliable
the
gentleman
whom
i
have
already
quoted
under
the
name
of
lancaster
he
who
was
so
doubtful
as
to
the
validity
of
the
photographs
is
himself
a
seer
he
says
personally
i
should
describe
fairies
as
being
about
feet
inches
to
feet
in
height
and
dressed
in
duffle
brown
clothes
the
nearest
approach
i
can
get
to
them
is
to
say
that
they
are
spiritual
monkeys
they
have
the
active
brains
of
monkeys
and
their
general
instinct
is
to
avoid
mankind
but
they
are
capable
individually
of
becoming
extremely
attached
to
humans
or
a
human
but
at
any
time
they
may
bite
you
like
a
monkey
and
repent
immediately
afterwards
they
have
thousands
of
years
of
collective
experience
call
it
memory
if
you
like
but
no
reasoning
faculties
they
are
just
peter
pans
children
who
never
grow
up
i
remember
asking
one
of
our
spirit
group
how
one
could
get
into
touch
with
the
brownies
he
replied
that
when
you
could
go
into
the
woods
and
call
the
brown
rabbits
to
you
the
other
brownies
will
also
come
to
you
speaking
generally
i
should
imagine
that
anyone
who
has
had
any
truck
with
fairies
must
have
obeyed
the
scriptural
injunction
to
as
a
little
child
he
or
she
must
be
either
simple
or
a
buddha
this
last
phrase
is
a
striking
one
and
it
is
curiously
confirmed
by
a
gentleman
named
matthews
writing
on
january
from
san
antonio
texas
he
declared
that
his
three
daughters
now
married
women
could
all
see
fairies
before
the
age
of
puberty
but
never
after
it
the
fairies
said
to
them
we
are
not
of
the
human
evolution
very
few
humans
have
ever
visited
us
only
old
souls
well
advanced
in
evolution
or
in
a
state
of
sex
innocence
can
come
to
us
this
repeats
independently
the
idea
of
lancaster
these
children
seem
to
have
gone
into
a
trance
state
before
they
found
themselves
in
the
country
of
the
fairies
a
country
of
intelligent
beings
very
small
to
inches
high
according
to
their
accounts
they
were
invited
to
attend
banquets
or
celebrations
excursions
on
beautiful
lakes
etc
each
child
was
able
to
entrance
instantly
this
they
always
did
when
they
visited
fairyland
but
when
the
fairies
came
to
them
which
was
generally
in
the
twilight
they
sat
in
chairs
in
normal
state
watching
them
dance
the
father
adds
my
own
children
learned
in
this
way
to
dance
so
that
at
local
entertainments
audiences
were
delighted
though
they
never
knew
from
what
source
they
learned
my
correspondent
does
not
say
whether
there
is
a
marked
difference
between
the
european
and
the
american
type
of
fairy
no
doubt
if
these
results
are
confirmed
and
followed
up
there
will
be
an
exact
classification
in
the
future
if
bishop
leadbeater
clairvoyance
can
be
trusted
there
is
as
will
afterwards
be
shown
a
very
clear
distinction
between
the
elemental
life
of
various
countries
as
well
as
many
varieties
in
each
particular
country
one
remarkable
case
of
seeing
fairies
came
from
the
rev
arnold
holmes
he
wrote
being
brought
up
in
the
isle
of
man
one
breathed
the
atmosphere
of
superstition
if
you
like
to
call
it
the
simple
beautiful
faith
of
the
manx
fisher
folk
the
childlike
trust
of
the
manx
girls
who
to
this
day
will
not
forget
the
bit
of
wood
and
coal
put
ready
at
the
side
of
the
fireplace
in
case
the
people
call
and
need
a
fire
a
good
husband
is
the
ultimate
reward
and
neglect
in
this
respect
a
bad
husband
or
no
husband
at
all
the
startling
phenomena
occurred
on
my
journey
home
from
peel
town
at
night
to
where
i
was
incumbent
after
passing
sir
hall
caine
beautiful
residence
greeba
castle
my
horse
a
spirited
one
suddenly
stopped
dead
and
looking
ahead
i
saw
amid
the
obscure
light
and
misty
moonbeams
what
appeared
to
be
a
small
army
of
indistinct
figures
very
small
clad
in
gossamer
garments
they
appeared
to
be
perfectly
happy
scampering
and
tripping
along
the
road
having
come
from
the
direction
of
the
beautiful
sylvan
glen
of
greeba
and
trinian
roofless
church
the
legend
is
that
it
has
ever
been
the
fairies
haunt
and
when
an
attempt
has
been
made
on
two
occasions
to
put
a
roof
on
the
fairies
have
removed
all
the
work
during
the
night
and
for
a
century
no
further
attempts
have
been
made
it
has
therefore
been
left
to
the
people
who
claimed
it
as
their
own
i
watched
spellbound
my
horse
half
mad
with
fear
the
little
happy
army
then
turned
in
the
direction
of
witch
hill
and
mounted
a
mossy
bank
one
man
of
larger
stature
than
the
rest
about
inches
high
stood
at
attention
until
all
had
passed
him
dancing
singing
with
happy
abandon
across
the
valley
fields
towards
john
mount
the
wide
distribution
of
the
fairies
may
be
judged
by
the
following
extremely
interesting
narrative
from
hardy
the
wife
of
a
settler
in
the
maori
districts
of
new
zealand
after
reading
about
what
others
have
seen
i
am
encouraged
to
give
you
an
experience
of
my
own
which
happened
about
five
years
ago
will
you
please
excuse
my
mentioning
a
few
domestic
details
connected
with
the
story
our
home
is
built
on
the
top
of
a
ridge
the
ground
was
levelled
for
some
distance
to
allow
for
sites
for
the
house
buildings
lawns
etc
the
ground
on
either
side
slopes
steeply
down
to
an
orchard
on
the
left
and
shrubbery
and
paddock
on
the
right
bounded
by
the
main
road
one
evening
when
it
was
getting
dusk
i
went
into
the
yard
to
hang
the
on
the
as
i
stepped
off
the
verandah
i
heard
a
sound
of
soft
galloping
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
orchard
i
thought
i
must
be
mistaken
and
that
the
sound
came
from
the
road
where
the
maoris
often
gallop
their
horses
i
crossed
the
yard
to
get
the
pegs
and
heard
the
galloping
coming
nearer
i
walked
to
the
and
stood
under
it
with
my
arms
uplifted
to
peg
the
towel
on
the
line
when
i
was
aware
of
the
galloping
close
behind
me
and
suddenly
a
little
figure
riding
a
tiny
pony
rode
right
under
my
uplifted
arms
i
looked
round
to
see
that
i
was
surrounded
by
eight
or
ten
tiny
figures
on
tiny
ponies
like
dwarf
shetlands
the
little
figure
who
came
so
close
to
me
stood
out
quite
clearly
in
the
light
that
came
from
the
window
but
he
had
his
back
to
it
and
i
could
not
see
his
face
the
faces
of
the
others
were
quite
brown
also
the
ponies
were
brown
if
they
wore
clothes
they
were
like
a
child
jersey
suit
they
were
like
tiny
dwarfs
or
children
of
about
two
years
of
age
i
was
very
startled
and
called
out
what
is
this
i
think
i
must
have
frightened
them
for
at
the
sound
of
my
voice
they
all
rode
through
the
rose
trellis
across
the
drive
and
down
the
shrubbery
i
heard
the
soft
galloping
dying
away
into
the
distance
and
listened
until
the
sound
was
gone
then
went
into
the
house
my
daughter
who
has
had
several
psychic
experiences
said
to
me
how
white
and
startled
you
look
what
have
you
seen
and
who
were
you
speaking
to
just
now
in
the
yard
i
said
have
seen
the
fairies
ride
the
little
fairy
horses
are
mentioned
by
several
writers
and
yet
it
must
be
admitted
that
their
presence
makes
the
whole
situation
far
more
complicated
and
difficult
to
understand
if
horses
why
not
dogs
and
we
find
ourselves
in
a
whole
new
world
upon
the
fairy
scale
i
have
convinced
myself
that
there
is
overwhelming
evidence
for
the
fairies
but
i
have
by
no
means
been
able
to
assure
myself
of
these
adjuncts
the
following
letter
from
a
young
lady
in
canada
daughter
of
one
of
the
leading
citizens
of
montreal
and
personally
known
to
me
is
interesting
on
account
of
the
enclosed
photograph
here
reproduced
she
says
the
enclosed
photograph
was
taken
this
summer
at
waterville
new
hampshire
with
a
brownie
camera
portrait
lens
attached
by
alverda
eleven
years
old
the
father
is
able
enthusiastic
on
golf
and
billiards
the
mother
on
japanese
art
neither
interested
in
psychic
matters
much
the
child
has
been
frail
and
imaginative
but
sweet
and
incapable
of
deceit
the
mother
tells
me
she
was
with
the
child
when
the
picture
was
taken
the
mushrooms
pleased
the
little
girl
and
she
knelt
down
and
photographed
them
as
an
indication
of
their
ordinary
size
they
are
there
was
no
such
figure
to
be
seen
as
appears
in
the
picture
there
was
no
double
exposure
the
picture
astonished
them
when
developed
the
parents
guarantee
its
honesty
but
are
mystified
do
you
think
shadows
can
explain
it
i
think
the
line
of
the
right
shoulder
and
arm
especially
are
too
decisive
to
be
thus
brushed
away
i
rather
agree
with
the
writer
but
it
is
a
point
which
each
reader
can
decide
for
himself
upon
examination
of
the
photograph
it
is
certainly
very
vague
after
the
yorkshire
examples
new
zealand
would
appear
to
be
quite
a
fairy
centre
for
i
have
another
letter
from
a
lady
in
those
beautiful
islands
which
is
hardly
less
interesting
and
definite
than
the
one
already
quoted
she
says
i
have
seen
fairies
in
all
parts
of
new
zealand
but
especially
in
the
gullies
of
the
north
island
most
of
my
unfoldment
for
mediumship
was
carried
out
in
auckland
and
during
that
time
i
spent
hours
in
my
garden
and
saw
the
fairies
most
often
in
the
evening
just
after
sunset
from
observation
i
notice
they
usually
lived
or
else
appeared
about
the
perennial
plants
i
saw
brown
fairies
and
green
fairies
and
they
all
had
wings
of
a
filmy
appearance
i
used
to
talk
to
them
and
ask
them
to
make
special
pet
plants
and
cuttings
i
put
in
the
garden
grow
well
and
i
am
sure
they
did
by
the
results
i
got
since
i
came
to
sydney
i
have
also
seen
the
green
fairies
i
tried
an
experiment
last
spring
i
had
some
narcissus
growing
in
the
garden
i
saw
the
green
fairies
about
them
i
transplanted
one
of
the
bulbs
to
a
pot
when
and
took
it
with
me
when
i
went
away
for
a
short
holiday
i
asked
the
fairies
to
keep
it
growing
i
watched
it
closely
every
evening
a
fairy
sometimes
two
or
three
of
them
would
appear
on
the
pot
under
the
plant
and
whatever
they
did
to
it
during
the
night
i
do
not
know
but
next
morning
it
was
very
much
bigger
and
although
transplanted
it
flowered
three
weeks
before
those
in
the
garden
i
am
now
living
at
rochdale
sydney
with
friends
both
australians
and
spiritualists
and
they
also
have
seen
the
fairies
from
childhood
up
i
am
sure
animals
see
them
the
fairies
appear
every
evening
in
a
little
wild
corner
of
the
garden
we
leave
for
them
and
our
cat
sits
and
watches
them
intently
but
never
attempts
to
spring
at
them
as
he
does
at
other
moving
objects
if
you
care
to
make
use
of
the
information
contained
in
this
letter
you
are
welcome
to
do
so
i
had
another
interesting
letter
from
roberts
of
dunedin
one
of
the
most
gifted
women
in
psychic
matters
whom
i
met
during
my
australian
wanderings
in
which
she
describes
as
the
last
writer
has
done
the
intimate
connection
between
these
elemental
forms
of
life
and
the
flowers
asserting
that
she
has
continually
seen
them
tending
the
plants
in
her
own
garden
from
ireland
i
received
several
fairy
stories
which
seemed
to
be
honestly
told
even
if
some
margin
must
be
left
for
errors
of
observation
one
of
these
seems
to
link
up
the
fairy
kingdom
with
spiritual
communication
for
the
writer
miss
winter
of
blarney
in
cork
says
we
received
communications
from
a
fairy
named
bebel
several
times
one
of
them
lasting
nearly
an
hour
the
communication
was
as
decided
and
swift
as
from
the
most
powerful
spirit
he
told
us
that
he
was
a
leprechaun
male
but
that
in
a
ruined
fort
near
us
dwelt
the
pixies
our
demesne
had
been
the
habitation
of
leprechauns
always
and
they
with
their
queen
picel
mounted
on
her
gorgeous
found
all
they
required
in
our
grounds
he
asked
most
lovingly
about
my
little
grandchildren
who
visit
us
frequently
and
since
then
he
has
been
in
the
habit
of
communicating
with
them
when
we
have
yielded
the
table
to
them
entirely
and
just
listened
to
the
pure
fun
he
and
they
were
having
together
he
told
them
that
the
fairies
find
it
quite
easy
to
talk
to
the
rabbits
and
that
they
disliked
the
dogs
because
they
chased
them
they
have
great
fun
with
the
hens
on
whose
backs
they
ride
but
they
do
not
like
them
because
they
at
them
when
he
mentioned
the
old
fort
i
thought
he
referred
to
blarney
castle
not
far
away
but
on
relating
the
incident
to
a
farmer
daughter
whose
family
has
been
in
the
neighbourhood
for
a
very
long
time
she
informed
me
that
a
cottage
at
the
entrance
to
our
avenue
is
built
on
the
site
of
an
old
fort
information
absolutely
new
to
us
a
few
more
may
be
added
to
my
list
of
witnesses
which
might
be
greatly
extended
miss
hall
of
bristol
writes
i
too
have
seen
fairies
but
never
until
now
have
i
dared
to
mention
it
for
fear
of
ridicule
it
was
many
years
ago
i
was
quite
a
child
of
six
or
seven
years
and
then
as
now
passionately
fond
of
all
flowers
which
always
seem
to
me
living
creatures
i
was
seated
in
the
middle
of
a
road
in
some
cornfields
playing
with
a
group
of
poppies
and
never
shall
i
forget
my
utter
astonishment
at
seeing
a
funny
little
man
playing
among
these
flowers
to
amuse
me
as
i
thought
he
was
quick
as
a
dart
i
watched
him
for
quite
a
long
time
then
he
disappeared
he
seemed
a
merry
little
fellow
but
i
can
not
ever
remember
his
face
in
colour
he
was
a
his
limbs
were
round
and
had
the
appearance
of
geranium
stalks
he
did
not
seem
to
be
clothed
and
was
about
three
inches
high
and
slender
i
often
looked
for
him
again
but
without
success

writes
some
years
ago
i
was
one
of
a
party
invited
to
spend
the
afternoon
on
the
lovely
slopes
of
oxeford
hill
in
the
county
of
dorset
the
absence
of
both
trees
and
hedges
in
this
locality
enables
one
to
see
without
obstruction
for
long
distances
i
was
walking
with
my
companion
who
lives
in
the
locality
some
little
distance
from
the
main
party
when
to
my
astonishment
i
saw
a
number
of
what
i
thought
to
be
very
small
children
about
a
score
in
number
and
all
dressed
in
little
short
skirts
their
legs
being
bare
their
hands
were
joined
and
all
held
up
as
they
merrily
danced
round
in
a
perfect
circle
we
stood
watching
them
when
in
an
instant
they
all
vanished
from
our
sight
my
companion
told
me
they
were
fairies
and
that
they
often
came
to
that
particular
part
to
hold
their
revels
it
may
be
our
presence
disturbed
them
ethel
enid
wilson
of
worthing
writes
i
quite
believe
in
fairies
of
course
they
are
really
nature
spirits
i
have
often
seen
them
on
fine
sunny
days
playing
in
the
sea
and
riding
on
the
waves
but
no
one
i
have
ever
been
with
at
the
time
has
been
able
to
see
them
excepting
once
my
little
nephews
and
nieces
saw
them
too
they
were
like
little
dolls
quite
small
with
beautiful
bright
hair
and
they
were
constantly
moving
and
dancing
about
rose
of
told
us
in
a
chat
on
the
subject
i
think
i
have
always
seen
fairies
i
see
them
constantly
here
in
the
shrubbery
by
the
sea
they
congregate
under
the
trees
and
float
around
about
the
trees
and
gnomes
come
around
to
protect
them
the
gnomes
are
like
little
old
men
with
little
green
caps
and
their
clothes
are
generally
neutral
green
the
fairies
themselves
are
in
light
draperies
i
have
also
seen
them
in
the
conservatory
of
my
house
floating
about
among
the
flowers
and
plants
the
fairies
appear
to
be
perpetually
playing
excepting
when
they
go
to
rest
on
the
turf
or
in
a
tree
and
i
once
saw
a
group
of
gnomes
standing
on
each
shoulders
like
gymnasts
on
the
stage
they
seemed
to
be
living
as
much
as
i
am
it
is
not
imagination
i
have
seen
the
gnomes
arranging
a
sort
of
moss
bed
for
the
fairies
just
like
a
putting
her
chicks
to
bed
i
do
hear
any
sounds
from
the
gnomes
or
fairies
but
they
always
look
happy
as
if
they
were
having
a
real
good
time
miss
eva
longbottom
of
bristol
a
charming
vocalist
who
has
been
blind
from
birth
told
us
in
an
interview
i
have
seen
many
fairies
with
my
mind
eyes
that
is
clairvoyantly
they
are
of
various
kinds
the
ones
i
see
the
music
fairies
are
very
beautiful
describes
them
for
they
make
you
think
of
silver
and
they
have
dulcet
silvery
voices
they
speak
and
sing
but
more
in
sound
than
in
distinct
words
a
language
of
their
own
a
fairy
tongue
their
music
is
a
thing
we
can
not
translate
it
exists
in
itself
i
do
think
mendelssohn
has
truly
caught
it
but
music
reminds
me
of
the
music
i
have
heard
from
the
fairies
themselves
his
fairy
ballads
are
very
charming
then
there
are
dancing
fairies
their
dancing
is
dainty
and
full
of
grace
a
sweet
old
style
of
dance
without
any
tangles
in
it
i
am
generally
alone
when
i
see
them
not
necessarily
in
a
woodland
but
wherever
the
atmosphere
is
poetical
they
are
quite
real
another
kind
is
the
poem
fairies
they
are
more
ethereal
and
of
a
violet
shade
if
you
could
imagine
perdita
in
the
night
translated
from
the
stage
into
a
real
fairy
you
would
have
a
good
idea
of
the
poem
fairy
she
has
a
very
beautiful
girlish
character
the
same
might
be
said
of
miranda
but
she
is
more
sentimental
the
colour
fairies
are
also
most
interesting
if
you
can
imagine
each
colour
transformed
into
a
fairy
you
may
get
an
idea
of
what
they
are
like
they
are
in
airy
forms
and
dance
and
sing
in
the
tone
of
their
colours
i
have
not
seen
any
brownies
as
i
do
not
take
so
much
interest
in
the
domestic
side
of
the
fairies
life
when
i
was
young
i
had
it
so
much
impressed
on
me
that
fairies
were
imaginary
beings
that
i
would
not
believe
in
them
but
when
i
was
about
fourteen
i
began
to
realize
them
and
now
i
love
them
perhaps
it
was
the
deeper
study
of
the
arts
that
brought
them
to
me
i
have
felt
a
sympathetic
vibration
for
them
and
they
have
made
me
feel
that
we
were
friends
i
have
had
a
great
deal
of
happiness
and
good
fortune
in
my
life
and
perhaps
i
can
attribute
some
of
that
to
the
fairies
these
last
examples
i
owe
to
john
lewis
editor
of
the
who
collected
them
i
think
i
may
fairly
claim
that
if
all
of
them
be
added
to
those
which
i
have
quoted
in
my
original
article
and
these
again
be
linked
up
with
the
cottingley
children
and
photographs
we
are
in
a
position
to
present
our
case
with
some
confidence
to
the
public
chapter
viii
the
theosophic
view
of
fairies
of
all
religions
and
philosophies
in
western
lands
i
know
none
save
that
ancient
teaching
now
called
theosophy
which
has
any
place
in
it
for
elemental
forms
of
life
therefore
since
we
have
established
some
sort
of
independent
case
for
their
existence
it
is
well
that
we
should
examine
carefully
what
they
teach
and
see
how
far
it
fits
in
with
what
we
have
been
able
to
gather
or
to
demonstrate
there
is
no
one
who
has
a
better
right
to
speak
upon
the
point
than
my
gardner
since
he
is
both
the
discoverer
of
the
fairies
and
a
considerable
authority
upon
theosophic
teaching
i
am
glad
therefore
to
be
able
to
include
some
notes
from
his
pen
for
the
most
part
he
writes
amid
the
busy
commercialism
of
modern
times
the
fact
of
their
existence
has
faded
to
a
shadow
and
a
most
delightful
and
charming
field
of
nature
study
has
too
long
been
veiled
in
this
twentieth
century
there
is
promise
of
the
world
stepping
out
of
some
of
its
darker
shadows
maybe
it
is
an
indication
that
we
are
reaching
the
silver
lining
of
the
clouds
when
we
find
ourselves
suddenly
presented
with
actual
photographs
of
these
enchanting
little
creatures
relegated
long
since
to
the
realm
of
the
imaginary
and
fanciful
now
what
the
fairies
first
it
must
be
clearly
understood
that
all
that
be
photographed
must
of
necessity
be
physical
nothing
of
a
subtler
order
could
in
the
nature
of
things
affect
the
sensitive
plate
spirit
photographs
for
instance
imply
necessarily
a
certain
degree
of
materialization
before
the
could
come
within
the
range
even
of
the
most
sensitive
of
films
but
well
within
our
physical
octave
there
are
degrees
of
density
that
elude
ordinary
vision
just
as
there
are
many
stars
in
the
heavens
recorded
by
the
camera
that
no
human
eye
has
ever
seen
directly
so
there
is
a
vast
array
of
living
creatures
whose
bodies
are
of
that
rare
tenuity
and
subtlety
from
our
point
of
view
that
they
lie
beyond
the
range
of
our
normal
senses
many
children
and
sensitives
see
them
and
hence
our
fairy
lore
all
founded
on
actual
and
now
demonstrable
fact
fairies
use
bodies
of
a
density
that
we
should
describe
in
language
as
of
a
lighter
than
gaseous
nature
but
we
should
be
entirely
wrong
if
we
thought
them
in
consequence
unsubstantial
in
their
own
way
they
are
as
real
as
we
are
and
perform
functions
in
connection
with
plant
life
of
an
important
and
most
fascinating
character
to
hint
at
one
phase
many
a
reader
will
have
remarked
on
the
lasting
freshness
and
beauty
of
flowers
cut
and
tended
by
one
person
and
on
the
other
hand
their
comparatively
short
life
when
in
the
care
of
another
the
explanation
is
to
be
found
in
the
kindly
devotion
of
the
one
person
and
the
comparative
indifference
of
the
other
which
emotions
affect
keenly
the
nature
spirits
in
whose
immediate
care
the
flowers
are
their
response
to
love
and
tenderness
is
quickly
evidenced
in
their
charges
fairies
are
not
born
and
do
not
die
as
we
do
though
they
have
their
periods
of
outer
activity
and
retirement
allied
to
the
or
butterfly
genus
of
our
familiar
acquaintance
rather
than
to
the
mammalian
line
they
partake
of
certain
characteristics
that
are
obvious
there
is
little
or
no
mentality
awake
simply
a
gladsome
irresponsible
joyousness
of
life
that
is
abundantly
in
evidence
in
their
enchanting
abandon
the
diminutive
human
form
so
widely
assumed
is
doubtless
due
at
least
in
a
great
measure
to
the
powerful
influence
of
human
thought
the
strongest
creative
power
in
our
cycle
in
the
investigations
i
have
pursued
in
yorkshire
the
new
forest
and
scotland
many
fairy
lovers
and
observers
have
been
interviewed
and
their
accounts
compared
in
most
cases
i
was
interested
to
note
that
my
share
in
making
public
the
photographs
of
cottingley
was
the
worst
sort
of
introduction
imaginable
few
fairy
lovers
have
looked
with
favour
on
that
reproaches
have
been
frequent
and
couched
in
no
measured
terms
for
the
photographs
have
been
resented
as
an
unwarranted
intrusion
and
desecration
only
after
earnest
assurances
as
to
my
own
attitude
could
i
get
farther
and
obtain
those
intimate
confidences
that
i
have
compared
and
checked
and
pieced
together
and
am
at
liberty
to
narrate
here
the
function
of
the
nature
spirit
of
woodland
meadow
and
garden
indeed
in
connection
with
vegetation
generally
is
to
furnish
the
vital
connecting
link
between
the
stimulating
energy
of
the
sun
and
the
raw
material
of
the
form
that
growth
of
a
plant
which
we
regard
as
the
customary
and
inevitable
result
of
associating
the
three
factors
of
sun
seed
and
soil
would
never
take
place
if
the
fairy
builders
were
absent
we
do
not
obtain
music
from
an
organ
by
associating
the
wind
a
composer
score
and
the
instrument
the
vital
link
supplied
by
the
organist
though
he
may
be
unseen
is
needed
and
similarly
the
nature
spirits
are
essential
to
the
production
of
the
plant
the
fairy
the
normal
working
body
of
the
gnome
and
fairy
is
not
of
human
nor
of
any
other
definite
form
and
herein
lies
the
explanation
of
much
that
has
been
puzzling
concerning
the
kingdom
generally
they
have
no
shape
normally
and
one
can
only
describe
them
as
small
hazy
and
somewhat
luminous
clouds
of
colour
with
a
brighter
nucleus
as
such
they
can
not
be
defined
in
terms
of
form
any
more
than
one
can
so
describe
a
tongue
of
flame
in
such
a
body
they
fill
their
office
working
the
plant
structure
is
the
only
word
that
can
describe
their
method
instantly
responsive
to
stimulus
they
appear
to
be
influenced
from
two
directions
the
physical
outer
conditions
prevailing
and
an
inner
intelligent
urge
these
two
influences
determine
their
working
activity
some
and
these
are
by
far
the
most
numerous
work
on
cell
construction
and
organization
and
are
comparatively
small
when
assuming
the
human
form
being
two
to
three
inches
high
others
are
concerned
exclusively
with
root
development
below
ground
while
others
are
apparently
specialists
in
colour
and
the
flowers
by
means
of
the
streaming
motion
of
their
bodies
there
appears
to
be
little
trace
of
any
selective
or
discriminating
work
done
individually
they
all
seem
actuated
by
a
common
influence
that
affects
them
continuously
and
which
strongly
suggests
the
same
type
of
instinctive
prompting
that
marks
the
bee
and
ant
the
human
though
the
nature
spirit
must
be
regarded
as
practically
irresponsible
living
a
gladsome
joyous
and
delightfully
untrammelled
life
each
member
appears
to
possess
at
least
a
temporary
definite
individuality
at
times
and
to
rejoice
in
it
the
diminutive
human
form
sometimes
grotesque
as
in
the
case
of
brownie
and
gnome
sometimes
beautifully
graceful
as
in
the
variety
if
conditions
allow
is
assumed
in
a
flash
for
a
while
it
is
retained
and
it
seems
clear
that
the
definite
and
comparatively
concrete
shape
affords
pleasure
above
the
ordinary
there
is
no
organization
perceptible
as
one
might
perhaps
hastily
infer
the
content
of
the
body
still
appears
homogeneous
though
somewhat
denser
and
the
shape
of
is
usually
only
seen
when
not
at
work
the
nature
spirit
so
clothed
indulges
in
active
movement
in
skipping
and
dancing
gestures
and
exhibits
a
gay
abandon
suggestive
of
the
keenest
delight
in
the
experience
it
is
evidently
off
and
play
for
it
though
its
work
seems
charming
enough
if
disturbed
or
alarmed
the
change
back
to
the
slightly
subtler
vehicle
the
magnetic
cloud
is
as
sudden
as
the
birth
what
determines
the
shape
assumed
and
how
the
transformation
is
effected
is
not
clear
one
may
speculate
as
to
the
influence
of
human
thought
individual
or
in
the
mass
and
quite
probably
the
explanation
when
found
will
include
this
influence
as
a
factor
but
i
am
intent
here
not
on
theorizing
but
on
a
narrative
of
observed
happenings
one
thing
is
clear
the
form
is
objective
objective
that
is
in
the
sense
in
which
we
apply
that
term
to
a
stone
a
tree
and
a
human
body
fairy
the
wings
are
a
feature
that
one
would
hardly
expect
to
find
in
conjunction
with
arms
in
this
respect
the
insect
type
with
its
several
limbs
and
two
or
more
wings
is
a
nearer
model
but
there
is
no
articulation
and
no
venation
and
moreover
the
wings
are
not
used
for
flying
emanations
is
the
only
description
one
can
apply
in
some
varieties
particularly
the
sylphs
the
streamers
surround
the
body
as
by
a
luminous
aura
sprayed
to
a
feathery
mist
i
was
told
that
the
earlier
and
more
elaborate
red
indian
headdresses
must
have
been
inspired
from
this
source
so
suggestive
are
they
though
the
best
of
them
are
but
poor
copies
of
the
originals
there
is
no
food
taken
as
we
should
regard
it
nourishment
usually
abundant
and
ample
for
sustenance
is
absorbed
directly
by
a
rhythmic
breathing
or
pulse
resource
to
the
magnetic
bath
on
occasion
appears
to
be
their
only
special
restorative
the
perfume
of
flowers
is
delighted
in
and
reversely
disagreeable
odours
repel
this
is
one
of
many
reasons
besides
timidity
why
human
society
is
usually
avoided
there
being
little
that
is
inviting
in
that
connection
for
them
and
much
that
is
obnoxious
birth
death
and
any
estimate
of
length
of
life
is
misleading
because
comparison
with
ourselves
can
not
be
made
there
is
no
real
birth
nor
death
as
we
understand
the
terms
simply
a
gradual
emergence
from
and
a
return
to
a
subtler
state
of
being
this
process
takes
some
time
probably
years
in
certain
varieties
and
their
life
on
the
denser
level
corresponding
to
our
adult
period
may
be
as
long
as
the
average
human
there
is
nothing
definite
in
all
this
however
except
the
fact
of
the
emergence
and
return
there
is
no
sex
as
we
should
regard
it
though
so
far
as
i
can
gather
there
is
division
and
of
at
a
much
subtler
and
earlier
level
than
that
usually
sensed
this
process
seems
to
correspond
to
the
fission
and
budding
of
our
familiar
simple
animalcules
with
the
addition
towards
the
end
of
the
cycle
of
fusion
or
reassembly
into
the
larger
unit
speech
and
below
the
sylph
there
appears
to
be
nothing
or
very
little
in
the
way
of
a
language
of
words
communication
is
possible
by
inflexion
and
gesture
much
as
the
same
can
be
exercised
with
domestic
animals
indeed
the
relation
of
human
with
the
lower
nature
spirits
seems
to
be
about
on
a
par
with
that
of
kittens
puppies
and
birds
yet
there
is
abundant
evidence
of
a
tone
language
among
them
music
by
pipe
and
flute
is
common
though
to
the
human
ear
of
the
quaintest
character
but
whether
the
instrument
or
the
voice
is
the
real
source
i
can
not
yet
determine
the
higher
orders
of
nature
spirits
are
adding
mentality
to
the
emotional
development
and
speech
with
them
is
possible
their
attitude
to
ordinary
humanity
is
unfriendly
rather
than
well
disposed
and
often
hostile
arising
probably
from
our
utter
disregard
of
the
amenities
i
am
beginning
to
see
sense
and
reason
in
the
of
yore
pollution
of
the
atmosphere
is
a
horror
to
the
sylphs
and
deeply
resented
an
ancient
saying
i
had
seen
somewhere
came
to
mind
when
discussing
the
beautiful
and
their
work
fire
is
the
mouth
of
the
gods
our
sanitary
and
burial
customs
are
doubtless
still
capable
of
improvement
one
fairy
lover
said
to
me
gleefully
well
you
will
never
be
able
to
get
photographs
of
the
sylphs
they
know
too
much
for
you
if
we
can
establish
friendly
relations
with
them
though
the
weather
may
be
ours
if
that
be
desirable
cause
and
the
dissection
and
examination
of
vegetable
forms
however
exhaustive
is
but
an
analysis
of
no
adequate
is
therein
to
be
found
any
more
than
a
dissection
of
a
sculpture
will
disclose
the
craftsman
the
amazing
skill
in
evidence
in
the
plant
kingdom
in
construction
adaptation
and
adornment
demand
the
labour
of
workman
mechanic
and
artist
their
recognition
in
the
nature
spirits
fills
the
vague
hiatus
between
the
sun
energy
and
the
material
wrought
on
our
own
human
side
of
the
line
the
finding
of
two
pieces
of
wood
nailed
together
would
unmistakably
point
to
a
workman
of
sorts
yet
we
are
accustomed
to
gaze
with
wonder
and
admiration
on
the
exquisitely
built
forms
of
a
whole
kingdom
and
murmur
processes
or
hand
of
god
according
to
our
temperament
an
agent
is
necessary
on
the
one
side
and
no
less
on
the
other
mode
of
the
feature
that
will
appeal
to
every
nature
lover
interested
in
the
vital
processes
of
plant
life
is
the
craftsmanship
of
the
agent
an
inference
if
it
be
simple
enough
often
escapes
us
though
in
this
case
the
experiences
gathered
of
our
own
human
labour
suggest
the
analogy
vividly
an
analogy
with
a
difference
however
for
the
hidden
manner
of
work
of
the
nature
spirit
is
in
most
respects
the
exact
opposite
in
character
to
our
own
in
this
physical
world
we
labour
with
hands
and
tools
and
work
consistently
on
exteriors
always
indeed
handling
and
applying
our
material
from
the
outside
addition
accretion
is
our
constructive
method
we
find
ourselves
made
that
way
and
it
is
our
characteristic
mode
of
approach
the
nature
spirits
operate
from
the
interior
working
from
a
centre
outwards
their
aim
appears
to
be
to
achieve
an
touch
with
the
environment
and
to
that
end
the
driving
urge
of
their
activity
is
how
best
to
adapt
the
means
to
their
hand
it
is
easy
to
perceive
the
cause
of
variety
in
nature
in
view
of
this
striving
endeavour
to
organize
the
vehicle
that
the
nature
spirits
use
and
so
gain
in
endless
ways
a
closer
touch
flower
colouring
mimicry
seed
protection
and
distribution
defensive
and
aggressive
measures
all
the
devices
employed
to
attain
an
end
point
to
an
intelligence
working
through
agents
who
at
their
own
level
are
often
in
more
or
less
antagonistic
relation
with
each
other
variety
and
difference
is
as
much
in
evidence
as
among
humanity
and
makes
for
that
diversity
of
form
and
custom
that
we
find
on
our
side
so
fruitful
of
experience
in
the
tilling
of
the
soil
and
the
culture
of
plant
life
for
our
own
purposes
we
have
worked
intimately
together
though
unconsciously
the
efforts
of
nature
spirits
working
by
themselves
our
assistance
produce
the
wild
flowers
and
berries
of
our
woodlands
and
meadows
while
partnership
the
human
yields
a
record
of
cultivated
cereal
flower
and
fruit
immensely
richer
plant
the
relation
of
the
nature
spirit
to
the
consciousness
functioning
through
the
vegetable
kingdom
generally
is
an
interesting
study
too
for
the
twain
appear
quite
separate
this
might
perhaps
be
likened
to
the
rôle
respectively
of
crew
and
passenger
in
a
ship
the
slumbering
or
at
best
slowly
awakening
consciousness
of
the
plant
makes
of
it
little
more
than
an
idle
traveller
whereas
the
nature
spirits
alert
and
active
attend
to
the
upkeep
and
navigation
of
the
craft
and
the
voyage
through
the
kingdom
means
a
growth
and
development
for
both
the
what
might
follow
an
intelligent
understanding
of
the
people
and
the
establishment
of
mutual
good
feeling
opens
up
a
prospect
alluring
in
the
extreme
it
would
be
for
us
a
working
in
the
light
instead
of
in
darkness
a
foretaste
of
such
may
be
gathered
by
noting
the
effect
of
a
devoted
lover
of
flowers
on
his
or
her
charges
the
nature
spirit
responds
to
emotion
and
appears
keenly
appreciative
of
kindly
attention
and
affection
whether
this
applies
with
any
force
to
any
but
the
varieties
concerned
with
flowers
and
fruits
i
can
not
say
but
it
certainly
does
to
them
and
the
intelligent
direction
of
effort
in
place
of
empirical
incident
tempts
one
speculation
to
run
riot
as
to
future
possibilities
the
awakened
of
the
human
kingdom
with
a
vigorous
mentality
linked
to
kindly
emotion
and
physical
action
may
enable
an
debt
to
be
adjusted
we
have
served
the
line
of
evolution
consciously
not
at
all
but
by
understanding
the
situation
we
can
together
intelligently
and
helpfully
and
the
service
of
both
to
mutual
advantage
can
take
the
place
of
blind
experiment
and
groping
e
in
the
literature
of
theosophy
i
know
no
one
who
treats
the
elemental
forces
of
nature
more
fully
than
bishop
leadbeater
whom
i
met
in
my
australian
travels
and
who
impressed
me
by
his
venerable
appearance
his
ascetic
habits
and
his
claims
to
a
remarkable
clairvoyancy
which
has
as
he
alleges
opened
up
many
of
the
arcana
in
his
book
hidden
side
of
he
talks
very
fully
of
the
fairies
of
many
lands
dealing
with
the
little
creatures
whom
so
many
of
my
informants
have
seen
tending
flowers
the
seer
says
the
little
creatures
that
look
after
flowers
may
be
divided
into
two
great
classes
though
of
course
there
are
many
varieties
of
each
kind
the
first
class
may
properly
be
called
elementals
for
beautiful
though
they
are
they
are
in
reality
only
and
therefore
they
are
not
really
living
creatures
at
all
perhaps
i
should
rather
say
that
they
are
only
temporary
living
creatures
for
though
they
are
very
active
and
busy
during
their
little
lives
they
have
no
real
evolving
reincarnating
life
in
them
and
when
they
have
done
their
work
they
just
go
to
pieces
and
dissolve
into
the
surrounding
atmosphere
precisely
as
our
own
do
they
are
the
of
the
great
beings
or
angels
who
are
in
charge
of
the
evolution
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
when
one
of
these
great
ones
has
a
new
idea
connected
with
one
of
the
kinds
of
plants
or
flowers
which
are
under
his
charge
he
often
creates
a
for
the
special
purpose
of
carrying
out
that
idea
it
usually
takes
the
form
either
of
an
etheric
model
of
the
flower
itself
or
of
a
little
creature
which
hangs
round
the
plant
or
the
flower
all
through
the
time
that
the
buds
are
forming
and
gradually
builds
them
into
the
shape
and
colour
of
which
the
angel
has
thought
but
as
soon
as
the
plant
has
fully
grown
or
the
flower
has
opened
its
work
is
over
and
its
power
is
exhausted
and
as
i
have
said
it
just
simply
dissolves
because
the
will
to
do
that
piece
of
work
was
the
only
soul
that
it
had
but
there
is
quite
another
kind
of
little
creature
which
is
very
frequently
seen
playing
about
with
flowers
and
this
time
it
is
a
real
nature
spirit
there
are
many
varieties
of
these
also
one
of
the
commonest
forms
is
as
i
have
said
something
very
much
like
a
and
it
may
often
be
seen
buzzing
round
the
flowers
much
in
the
same
way
as
a
or
a
bee
does
these
beautiful
little
creatures
will
never
become
human
because
they
are
not
in
the
same
line
of
evolution
as
we
are
the
life
which
is
now
animating
them
has
come
up
through
grasses
and
cereals
such
as
wheat
and
oats
when
it
was
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
afterwards
through
ants
and
bees
when
it
was
in
the
animal
kingdom
now
it
has
reached
the
level
of
these
tiny
nature
spirits
and
its
next
stage
will
be
to
ensoul
some
of
the
beautiful
fairies
with
etheric
bodies
who
live
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
later
on
they
will
become
salamanders
or
fire
spirits
and
later
still
they
will
become
sylphs
or
air
spirits
having
only
astral
bodies
instead
of
etheric
later
still
they
will
pass
through
the
different
stages
of
the
great
kingdom
of
the
angels
speaking
of
the
national
characteristics
of
fairies
he
says
with
all
the
assurance
of
an
actual
observer
page
no
contrast
could
well
be
more
marked
than
that
between
the
vivacious
rollicking
or
mannikins
who
dance
among
the
vineyards
of
sicily
and
the
almost
wistful
creatures
who
move
so
much
more
sedately
amidst
the
oaks
and
heaths
in
brittany
or
the
people
who
haunt
the
hillsides
of
scotland
in
england
the
kind
is
probably
the
commonest
and
i
have
seen
it
also
in
the
woods
in
france
and
belgium
in
massachusetts
and
on
the
banks
of
the
niagara
river
the
vast
plains
of
the
dakotas
are
inhabited
by
a
kind
which
i
have
not
seen
elsewhere
and
california
rejoices
in
a
lovely
species
which
also
appears
to
be
unique
in
australia
the
most
frequent
type
is
a
very
distinctive
creature
of
a
wonderful
luminous
colour
but
there
is
a
wide
diversity
between
the
etheric
inhabitants
of
new
south
wales
or
victoria
and
those
of
tropical
northern
queensland
these
latter
approximate
closely
to
those
of
the
dutch
indies
java
seems
specially
prolific
in
these
graceful
creatures
and
the
kinds
most
common
there
are
two
distinct
types
both
monochromatic
one
indigo
blue
with
faint
metallic
gleamings
and
the
other
a
study
in
all
known
shades
of
yellow
quaint
but
wonderfully
effective
and
attractive
a
striking
local
variety
is
gaudily
ringed
with
alternate
bars
of
green
and
yellow
like
a
football
jersey
this
ringed
type
is
possibly
a
race
peculiar
to
that
part
of
the
world
for
i
saw
red
and
yellow
similarly
arranged
in
the
malay
peninsula
and
green
and
white
on
the
other
side
of
the
straits
in
sumatra
that
huge
island
also
rejoices
in
the
possession
of
a
lovely
pale
heliotrope
tribe
which
i
have
seen
before
only
in
the
hills
of
ceylon
down
in
new
zealand
their
speciality
is
a
deep
blue
shot
with
silver
while
in
the
south
sea
islands
one
meets
with
a
variety
which
coruscates
with
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
like
a
figure
of
in
india
we
find
all
sorts
from
the
delicate
or
of
the
to
the
rich
medley
of
gorgeously
gleaming
colours
almost
barbaric
in
their
intensity
and
profusion
which
is
characteristic
of
the
plains
in
some
parts
of
that
marvellous
country
i
have
seen
the
type
which
is
more
usually
associated
with
the
african
desert
and
also
a
species
which
resembles
a
statuette
made
out
of
a
gleaming
crimson
metal
such
as
was
the
orichalcum
of
the
atlanteans
somewhat
akin
to
this
last
is
a
curious
variety
which
looks
as
though
cast
out
of
bronze
and
burnished
it
appears
to
make
its
home
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
volcanic
disturbances
since
the
only
places
in
which
it
has
been
seen
so
far
are
the
slopes
of
vesuvius
and
etna
the
interior
of
java
the
sandwich
islands
the
yellowstone
park
in
north
america
and
a
certain
part
of
the
north
island
of
new
zealand
several
indications
seem
to
point
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
a
survival
of
a
primitive
type
and
represents
a
sort
of
intermediate
stage
between
the
gnome
and
the
fairy
in
some
cases
districts
close
together
are
found
to
be
inhabited
by
quite
different
classes
of
nature
spirits
for
example
as
has
already
been
mentioned
the
elves
are
common
in
belgium
yet
a
hundred
miles
away
in
holland
hardly
one
of
them
is
to
be
seen
and
their
place
is
taken
by
a
species
very
interesting
indeed
is
his
account
of
the
irish
fairies
speaking
of
a
sacred
mountain
in
ireland
he
says
a
curious
fact
is
that
altitude
above
the
seems
to
affect
their
distribution
those
who
belong
to
the
mountains
scarcely
ever
intermingling
with
those
of
the
plains
i
well
remember
when
climbing
one
of
the
traditionally
sacred
hills
of
ireland
noticing
the
very
definite
lines
of
demarcation
between
the
different
types
the
lower
slopes
like
the
surrounding
plains
were
alive
with
the
intensely
active
and
mischievous
little
race
which
swarms
all
over
the
south
and
west
of
ireland
being
especially
attracted
to
the
magnetic
centres
established
nearly
two
thousand
years
ago
by
the
priests
of
the
old
milesian
race
to
ensure
and
perpetuate
their
domination
over
the
people
by
keeping
them
under
the
influence
of
the
great
illusion
after
half
an
hour
climbing
however
not
one
of
these
gentry
was
to
be
seen
but
instead
the
was
populous
with
the
gentler
type
which
long
ago
owed
special
allegiance
to
the
these
also
had
their
zone
and
their
limits
and
no
nature
spirit
of
either
type
ever
ventured
to
trespass
upon
the
space
round
the
summit
sacred
to
the
great
green
angels
who
have
watched
there
for
more
than
two
thousand
years
guarding
one
of
the
centres
of
living
force
that
link
the
past
to
the
future
of
that
mystic
land
of
erin
taller
far
than
the
height
of
man
these
giant
forms
in
colour
like
the
first
new
leaves
of
spring
soft
luminous
shimmering
indescribable
look
forth
over
the
world
with
wondrous
eyes
that
shine
like
stars
full
of
the
peace
of
those
who
live
in
the
eternal
waiting
with
the
calm
certainty
of
knowledge
until
the
appointed
time
shall
come
one
realizes
very
fully
the
power
and
importance
of
the
hidden
side
of
things
when
one
beholds
such
a
spectacle
as
that
for
fuller
information
the
reader
may
well
be
referred
to
the
original
published
by
the
theosophical
publishing
house
the
book
is
a
storehouse
of
knowledge
upon
all
occult
matters
and
certainly
the
details
concerning
the
fairies
fit
in
remarkably
well
with
the
information
from
other
sources
i
have
now
laid
before
the
reader
the
full
circumstances
in
connection
with
the
five
successful
photographs
taken
at
cottingley
i
have
added
the
experience
of
a
clairvoyant
officer
in
the
company
of
the
girls
upon
the
third
and
unsuccessful
attempt
to
get
photographs
i
have
analysed
some
of
the
criticism
which
we
have
had
to
meet
i
have
given
the
reader
the
opportunity
of
judging
the
evidence
for
a
considerable
number
of
alleged
cases
collected
before
and
after
the
cottingley
incident
finally
i
have
placed
before
him
the
general
theory
of
the
place
in
creation
of
such
creatures
as
defined
by
the
only
system
of
thought
which
has
found
room
for
them
having
read
and
weighed
all
this
the
investigator
is
in
as
strong
a
position
as
gardner
or
myself
and
each
must
give
his
own
verdict
i
do
not
myself
contend
that
the
proof
is
as
overwhelming
as
in
the
case
of
spiritualistic
phenomena
we
can
not
call
upon
the
brightest
brains
in
the
scientific
world
the
crookes
the
lodges
or
the
lombrosos
for
confirmation
but
that
also
may
come
and
for
the
present
while
more
evidence
will
be
welcome
there
is
enough
already
available
to
convince
any
reasonable
man
that
the
matter
is
not
one
which
can
be
readily
dismissed
but
that
a
case
actually
exists
which
up
to
now
has
not
been
shaken
in
the
least
degree
by
any
of
the
criticism
directed
against
it
far
from
being
resented
such
criticism
so
long
as
it
is
earnest
and
honest
must
be
most
welcome
to
those
whose
only
aim
is
the
fearless
search
for
truth
