antecedents
i
on
november
died
the
princess
charlotte
only
child
of
the
prince
regent
and
heir
to
the
crown
of
england
her
short
life
had
hardly
been
a
happy
one
by
nature
impulsive
capricious
and
vehement
she
had
always
longed
for
liberty
and
she
had
never
possessed
it
she
had
been
brought
up
among
violent
family
quarrels
had
been
early
separated
from
her
disreputable
and
eccentric
mother
and
handed
over
to
the
care
of
her
disreputable
and
selfish
father
when
she
was
seventeen
he
decided
to
marry
her
off
to
the
prince
of
orange
she
at
first
acquiesced
but
suddenly
falling
in
love
with
prince
augustus
of
prussia
she
determined
to
break
off
the
engagement
this
was
not
her
first
love
affair
for
she
had
previously
carried
on
a
clandestine
correspondence
with
a
captain
hess
prince
augustus
was
already
married
morganatically
but
she
did
not
know
it
and
he
did
not
tell
her
while
she
was
spinning
out
the
negotiations
with
the
prince
of
orange
the
allied
sovereign
it
was
june
arrived
in
london
to
celebrate
their
victory
among
them
in
the
suite
of
the
emperor
of
russia
was
the
young
and
handsome
prince
leopold
of
he
made
several
attempts
to
attract
the
notice
of
the
princess
but
she
with
her
heart
elsewhere
paid
very
little
attention
next
month
the
prince
regent
discovering
that
his
daughter
was
having
secret
meetings
with
prince
augustus
suddenly
appeared
upon
the
scene
and
after
dismissing
her
household
sentenced
her
to
a
strict
seclusion
in
windsor
park
god
almighty
grant
me
patience
she
exclaimed
falling
on
her
knees
in
an
agony
of
agitation
then
she
jumped
up
ran
down
the
backstairs
and
out
into
the
street
hailed
a
passing
cab
and
drove
to
her
mother
house
in
bayswater
she
was
discovered
pursued
and
at
length
yielding
to
the
persuasions
of
her
uncles
the
dukes
of
york
and
sussex
of
brougham
and
of
the
bishop
of
salisbury
she
returned
to
carlton
house
at
two
in
the
morning
she
was
immured
at
windsor
but
no
more
was
heard
of
the
prince
of
orange
prince
augustus
too
disappeared
the
way
was
at
last
open
to
prince
leopold
of
this
prince
was
clever
enough
to
get
round
the
regent
to
impress
the
ministers
and
to
make
friends
with
another
of
the
princess
uncles
the
duke
of
kent
through
the
duke
he
was
able
to
communicate
privately
with
the
princess
who
now
declared
that
he
was
necessary
to
her
happiness
when
after
waterloo
he
was
in
paris
the
carried
letters
backwards
and
forwards
across
the
channel
in
january
he
was
invited
to
england
and
in
may
the
marriage
took
place
the
character
of
prince
leopold
contrasted
strangely
with
that
of
his
wife
the
younger
son
of
a
german
princeling
he
was
at
this
time
years
of
age
he
had
served
with
distinction
in
the
war
against
napoleon
he
had
shown
considerable
diplomatic
skill
at
the
congress
of
vienna
and
he
was
now
to
try
his
hand
at
the
task
of
taming
a
tumultuous
princess
cold
and
formal
in
manner
collected
in
speech
careful
in
action
he
soon
dominated
the
wild
impetuous
generous
creature
by
his
side
there
was
much
in
her
he
found
of
which
he
could
not
approve
she
quizzed
she
stamped
she
roared
with
laughter
she
had
very
little
of
that
which
is
especially
required
of
princes
her
manners
were
abominable
of
the
latter
he
was
a
good
judge
having
moved
as
he
himself
explained
to
his
niece
many
years
later
in
the
best
society
of
europe
being
in
fact
what
is
called
in
french
de
la
fleur
des
pois
there
was
continual
friction
but
every
scene
ended
in
the
same
way
standing
before
him
like
a
rebellious
boy
in
petticoats
her
body
pushed
forward
her
hands
behind
her
back
with
flaming
cheeks
and
sparkling
eyes
she
would
declare
at
last
that
she
was
ready
to
do
whatever
he
wanted
if
you
wish
it
i
will
do
it
she
would
say
i
want
nothing
for
myself
he
invariably
answered
when
i
press
something
on
you
it
is
from
a
conviction
that
it
is
for
your
interest
and
for
your
good
among
the
members
of
the
household
at
claremont
near
esher
where
the
royal
pair
were
established
was
a
young
german
physician
christian
friedrich
stockmar
he
was
the
son
of
a
minor
magistrate
in
coburg
and
after
taking
part
as
a
medical
officer
in
the
war
he
had
settled
down
as
a
doctor
in
his
native
town
here
he
had
met
prince
leopold
who
had
been
struck
by
his
ability
and
on
his
marriage
brought
him
to
england
as
his
personal
physician
a
curious
fate
awaited
this
young
man
many
were
the
gifts
which
the
future
held
in
store
for
him
many
and
various
influence
power
mystery
unhappiness
a
broken
heart
at
claremont
his
position
was
a
very
humble
one
but
the
princess
took
a
fancy
to
him
called
him
stocky
and
romped
with
him
along
the
corridors
dyspeptic
by
constitution
melancholic
by
temperament
he
could
yet
be
lively
on
occasion
and
was
known
as
a
wit
in
coburg
he
was
virtuous
too
and
served
the
royal
menage
with
approbation
my
master
he
wrote
in
his
diary
is
the
best
of
all
husbands
in
all
the
five
quarters
of
the
globe
and
his
wife
bears
him
an
amount
of
love
the
greatness
of
which
can
only
be
compared
with
the
english
national
debt
before
long
he
gave
proof
of
another
quality
a
quality
which
was
to
colour
the
whole
of
his
sagacity
when
in
the
spring
of
it
was
known
that
the
princess
was
expecting
a
child
the
post
of
one
of
her
was
offered
to
him
and
he
had
the
good
sense
to
refuse
it
he
perceived
that
his
colleagues
would
be
jealous
of
him
that
his
advice
would
probably
not
be
taken
but
that
if
anything
were
to
go
wrong
it
would
be
certainly
the
foreign
doctor
who
would
be
blamed
very
soon
indeed
he
came
to
the
opinion
that
the
low
diet
and
constant
bleedings
to
which
the
unfortunate
princess
was
subjected
were
an
error
he
drew
the
prince
aside
and
begged
him
to
communicate
this
opinion
to
the
english
doctors
but
it
was
useless
the
fashionable
lowering
treatment
was
continued
for
months
on
november
at
nine
in
the
evening
after
a
labour
of
over
fifty
hours
the
princess
was
delivered
of
a
dead
boy
at
midnight
her
exhausted
strength
gave
way
when
at
last
stockmar
consented
to
see
her
he
went
in
and
found
her
obviously
dying
while
the
doctors
were
plying
her
with
wine
she
seized
his
hand
and
pressed
it
they
have
made
me
tipsy
she
said
after
a
little
he
left
her
and
was
already
in
the
next
room
when
he
heard
her
call
out
in
her
loud
voice
stocky
stocky
as
he
ran
back
the
was
in
her
throat
she
tossed
herself
violently
from
side
to
side
then
suddenly
drew
up
her
legs
and
it
was
over
the
prince
after
hours
of
watching
had
left
the
room
for
a
few
moments
rest
and
stockmar
had
now
to
tell
him
that
his
wife
was
dead
at
first
he
could
not
be
made
to
realise
what
had
happened
on
their
way
to
her
room
he
sank
down
on
a
chair
while
stockmar
knelt
beside
him
it
was
all
a
dream
it
was
impossible
at
last
by
the
bed
he
too
knelt
down
and
kissed
the
cold
hands
then
rising
and
exclaiming
now
i
am
quite
desolate
promise
me
never
to
leave
me
he
threw
himself
into
stockmar
arms
ii
the
tragedy
at
claremont
was
of
a
most
upsetting
kind
the
royal
kaleidoscope
had
suddenly
shifted
and
nobody
could
tell
how
the
new
pattern
would
arrange
itself
the
succession
to
the
throne
which
had
seemed
so
satisfactorily
settled
now
became
a
matter
of
urgent
doubt
george
iii
was
still
living
an
aged
lunatic
at
windsor
completely
impervious
to
the
impressions
of
the
outer
world
of
his
seven
sons
the
youngest
was
of
more
than
middle
age
and
none
had
legitimate
offspring
the
outlook
therefore
was
ambiguous
it
seemed
highly
improbable
that
the
prince
regent
who
had
lately
been
obliged
to
abandon
his
stays
and
presented
a
preposterous
figure
of
debauched
obesity
could
ever
again
even
on
the
supposition
that
he
divorced
his
wife
and
become
the
father
of
a
family
besides
the
duke
of
kent
who
must
be
noticed
separately
the
other
brothers
in
order
of
seniority
were
the
dukes
of
york
clarence
cumberland
sussex
and
cambridge
their
situations
and
prospects
require
a
brief
description
the
duke
of
york
whose
escapades
in
times
past
with
clarke
and
the
army
had
brought
him
into
trouble
now
divided
his
life
between
london
and
a
large
extravagantly
ordered
and
extremely
uncomfortable
country
house
where
he
occupied
himself
with
racing
whist
and
improper
stories
he
was
remarkable
among
the
princes
for
one
reason
he
was
the
only
one
of
them
so
we
are
informed
by
a
highly
competent
observer
who
had
the
feelings
of
a
gentleman
he
had
been
long
married
to
the
princess
royal
of
prussia
a
lady
who
rarely
went
to
bed
and
was
perpetually
surrounded
by
vast
numbers
of
dogs
parrots
and
monkeys
they
had
no
children
the
duke
of
clarence
had
lived
for
many
years
in
complete
obscurity
with
jordan
the
actress
in
bushey
park
by
her
he
had
had
a
large
family
of
sons
and
daughters
and
had
appeared
in
effect
to
be
married
to
her
when
he
suddenly
separated
from
her
and
offered
to
marry
miss
wykeham
a
crazy
woman
of
large
fortune
who
however
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
him
shortly
afterwards
jordan
died
in
distressed
circumstances
in
paris
the
duke
of
cumberland
was
probably
the
most
unpopular
man
in
england
hideously
ugly
with
a
distorted
eye
he
was
and
vindictive
in
private
a
violent
reactionary
in
politics
and
was
subsequently
suspected
of
murdering
his
valet
and
of
having
carried
on
an
amorous
intrigue
of
an
extremely
scandalous
kind
he
had
lately
married
a
german
princess
but
there
were
as
yet
no
children
by
the
marriage
the
duke
of
sussex
had
mildly
literary
tastes
and
collected
books
he
had
married
lady
augusta
murray
by
whom
he
had
two
children
but
the
marriage
under
the
royal
marriages
act
was
declared
void
on
lady
augusta
death
he
married
lady
cecilia
buggin
she
changed
her
name
to
underwood
but
this
marriage
also
was
void
of
the
duke
of
cambridge
the
youngest
of
the
brothers
not
very
much
was
known
he
lived
in
hanover
wore
a
blonde
wig
chattered
and
fidgeted
a
great
deal
and
was
unmarried
besides
his
seven
sons
george
iii
had
five
surviving
daughters
of
these
two
the
queen
of
wurtemberg
and
the
duchess
of
gloucester
were
married
and
childless
the
three
unmarried
princesses
augusta
elizabeth
and
sophia
were
all
over
forty
iii
the
fourth
son
of
george
iii
was
edward
duke
of
kent
he
was
now
fifty
years
of
age
a
tall
stout
vigorous
man
with
bushy
eyebrows
a
bald
top
to
his
head
and
what
hair
he
had
carefully
dyed
a
glossy
black
his
dress
was
extremely
neat
and
in
his
whole
appearance
there
was
a
rigidity
which
did
not
belie
his
character
he
had
spent
his
early
life
in
the
army
at
gibraltar
in
canada
in
the
west
indies
and
under
the
influence
of
military
training
had
become
at
first
a
disciplinarian
and
at
last
a
martinet
in
having
been
sent
to
gibraltar
to
restore
order
in
a
mutinous
garrison
he
was
recalled
for
undue
severity
and
his
active
career
had
come
to
an
end
since
then
he
had
spent
his
life
regulating
his
domestic
arrangements
with
great
exactitude
busying
himself
with
the
affairs
of
his
numerous
dependents
designing
clocks
and
struggling
to
restore
order
to
his
finances
for
in
spite
of
his
being
as
someone
said
who
knew
him
well
regle
comme
du
papier
a
musique
and
in
spite
of
an
income
of
a
year
he
was
hopelessly
in
debt
he
had
quarrelled
with
most
of
his
brothers
particularly
with
the
prince
regent
and
it
was
only
natural
that
he
should
have
joined
the
political
opposition
and
become
a
pillar
of
the
whigs
what
his
political
opinions
may
actually
have
been
is
open
to
doubt
it
has
often
been
asserted
that
he
was
a
liberal
or
even
a
radical
and
if
we
are
to
believe
robert
owen
he
was
a
necessitarian
socialist
his
relations
with
owen
the
shrewd
gullible
illustrious
and
preposterous
father
of
socialism
and
were
curious
and
characteristic
he
talked
of
visiting
the
mills
at
new
lanark
he
did
in
fact
preside
at
one
of
owen
public
meetings
he
corresponded
with
him
on
confidential
terms
and
he
even
so
owen
assures
us
returned
after
his
death
from
the
sphere
of
spirits
to
give
encouragement
to
the
owenites
on
earth
in
an
especial
manner
says
owen
i
have
to
name
the
very
anxious
feelings
of
the
spirit
of
his
royal
highness
the
late
duke
of
kent
who
early
informed
me
that
there
were
no
titles
in
the
spititual
spheres
into
which
he
had
entered
to
benefit
not
a
class
a
sect
a
party
or
any
particular
country
but
the
whole
of
the
human
race
through
futurity
his
whole
with
me
has
been
most
beautiful
owen
adds
making
his
own
appointments
and
never
in
one
instance
has
this
spirit
not
been
punctual
to
the
minute
he
had
named
but
owen
was
of
a
sanguine
temperament
he
also
numbered
among
his
proselytes
president
jefferson
prince
metternich
and
napoleon
so
that
some
uncertainty
must
still
linger
over
the
duke
of
kent
views
but
there
is
no
uncertainty
about
another
circumstance
his
royal
highness
borrowed
from
robert
owen
on
various
occasions
various
sums
of
money
which
were
never
repaid
and
amounted
in
all
to
several
hundred
pounds
after
the
death
of
the
princess
charlotte
it
was
clearly
important
for
more
than
one
reason
that
the
duke
of
kent
should
marry
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
nation
the
lack
of
heirs
in
the
reigning
family
seemed
to
make
the
step
almost
obligatory
it
was
also
likely
to
be
highly
expedient
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
duke
to
marry
as
a
public
duty
for
the
sake
of
the
royal
succession
would
surely
deserve
some
recognition
from
a
grateful
country
when
the
duke
of
york
had
married
he
had
received
a
settlement
of
a
year
why
should
not
the
duke
of
kent
look
forward
to
an
equal
sum
but
the
situation
was
not
quite
simple
there
was
the
duke
of
clarence
to
be
considered
he
was
the
elder
brother
and
if
he
married
would
clearly
have
the
prior
claim
on
the
other
hand
if
the
duke
of
kent
married
it
was
important
to
remember
that
he
would
be
making
a
serious
sacrifice
a
lady
was
involved
the
duke
reflecting
upon
all
these
matters
with
careful
attention
happened
about
a
month
after
his
niece
death
to
visit
brussels
and
learnt
that
creevey
was
staying
in
the
town
creevey
was
a
close
friend
of
the
leading
whigs
and
an
inveterate
gossip
and
it
occurred
to
the
duke
that
there
could
be
no
better
channel
through
which
to
communicate
his
views
upon
the
situation
to
political
circles
at
home
apparently
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
creevey
was
malicious
and
might
keep
a
diary
he
therefore
sent
for
him
on
some
trivial
pretext
and
a
remarkable
conversation
ensued
after
referring
to
the
death
of
the
princess
to
the
improbability
of
the
regent
seeking
a
divorce
to
the
childlessness
of
the
duke
of
york
and
to
the
possibility
of
the
duke
of
clarence
marrying
the
duke
adverted
to
his
own
position
should
the
duke
of
clarence
not
marry
he
said
the
next
prince
in
succession
is
myself
and
although
i
trust
i
shall
be
at
all
times
ready
to
obey
any
call
my
country
may
make
upon
me
god
only
knows
the
sacrifice
it
will
be
to
make
whenever
i
shall
think
it
my
duty
to
become
a
married
man
it
is
now
seven
and
twenty
years
that
madame
laurent
and
i
have
lived
together
we
are
of
the
same
age
and
have
been
in
all
climates
and
in
all
difficulties
together
and
you
may
well
imagine
creevey
the
pang
it
will
occasion
me
to
part
with
her
i
put
it
to
your
own
feelings
in
the
event
of
any
separation
between
you
and
creevey
as
for
madame
laurent
herself
i
protest
i
do
know
what
is
to
become
of
her
if
a
marriage
is
to
be
forced
upon
me
her
feelings
are
already
so
agitated
upon
the
subject
the
duke
went
on
to
describe
how
one
morning
a
day
or
two
after
the
princess
charlotte
death
a
paragraph
had
appeared
in
the
morning
chronicle
alluding
to
the
possibility
of
his
marriage
he
had
received
the
newspaper
at
breakfast
together
with
his
letters
and
i
did
as
is
my
constant
practice
i
threw
the
newspaper
across
the
table
to
madame
laurent
and
began
to
open
and
read
my
letters
i
had
not
done
so
but
a
very
short
time
when
my
attention
was
called
to
an
extraordinary
noise
and
a
strong
convulsive
movement
in
madame
laurent
throat
for
a
short
time
i
entertained
serious
apprehensions
for
her
safety
and
when
upon
her
recovery
i
enquired
into
the
occasion
of
this
attack
she
pointed
to
the
article
in
the
morning
chronicle
the
duke
then
returned
to
the
subject
of
the
duke
of
clarence
my
brother
the
duke
of
clarence
is
the
elder
brother
and
has
certainly
the
right
to
marry
if
he
chooses
and
i
would
not
interfere
with
him
on
any
account
if
he
wishes
to
be
king
to
be
married
and
have
children
poor
man
god
help
him
let
him
do
so
for
myself
i
am
a
man
of
no
ambition
and
wish
only
to
remain
as
i
am
easter
you
know
falls
very
early
this
year
the
of
march
if
the
duke
of
clarence
does
not
take
any
step
before
that
time
i
must
find
some
pretext
to
reconcile
madame
laurent
to
my
going
to
england
for
a
short
time
when
once
there
it
will
be
easy
for
me
to
consult
with
my
friends
as
to
the
proper
steps
to
be
taken
should
the
duke
of
clarence
do
nothing
before
that
time
as
to
marrying
it
will
become
my
duty
no
doubt
to
take
some
measures
upon
the
subject
myself
two
names
the
duke
said
had
been
mentioned
in
this
connection
those
of
the
princess
of
baden
and
the
princess
of
the
latter
he
thought
would
perhaps
be
the
better
of
the
two
from
the
circumstance
of
prince
leopold
being
so
popular
with
the
nation
but
before
any
other
steps
were
taken
he
hoped
and
expected
to
see
justice
done
to
madame
laurent
she
is
he
explained
of
very
good
family
and
has
never
been
an
actress
and
i
am
the
first
and
only
person
who
ever
lived
with
her
her
disinterestedness
too
has
been
equal
to
her
fidelity
when
she
first
came
to
me
it
was
upon
a
year
that
sum
was
afterwards
raised
to
and
finally
to
but
when
my
debts
made
it
necessary
for
me
to
sacrifice
a
great
part
of
my
income
madame
laurent
insisted
upon
again
returning
to
her
income
of
a
year
if
madame
laurent
is
to
return
to
live
amongst
her
friends
it
must
be
in
such
a
state
of
independence
as
to
command
their
respect
i
shall
not
require
very
much
but
a
certain
number
of
servants
and
a
carriage
are
essentials
as
to
his
own
settlement
the
duke
observed
that
he
would
expect
the
duke
of
york
marriage
to
be
considered
the
precedent
that
he
said
was
a
marriage
for
the
succession
and
for
income
was
settled
in
addition
to
all
his
other
income
purely
on
that
account
i
shall
be
contented
with
the
same
arrangement
without
making
any
demands
grounded
on
the
difference
of
the
value
of
money
in
and
at
present
as
for
the
payment
of
my
debts
the
duke
concluded
i
do
call
them
great
the
nation
on
the
contrary
is
greatly
my
debtor
here
a
clock
struck
and
seemed
to
remind
the
duke
that
he
had
an
appointment
he
rose
and
creevey
left
him
who
could
keep
such
a
communication
secret
certainly
not
creevey
he
hurried
off
to
tell
the
duke
of
wellington
who
was
very
much
amused
and
he
wrote
a
long
account
of
it
to
lord
sefton
who
received
the
letter
very
apropos
while
a
surgeon
was
sounding
his
bladder
to
ascertain
whether
he
had
a
stone
i
never
saw
a
fellow
more
astonished
than
he
was
wrote
lord
sefton
in
his
reply
at
seeing
me
laugh
as
soon
as
the
operation
was
over
nothing
could
be
more
than
the
royal
edward
ingenuousness
one
does
not
know
which
to
admire
most
the
delicacy
of
his
attachment
to
madame
laurent
the
refinement
of
his
sentiments
towards
the
duke
of
clarence
or
his
own
perfect
disinterestedness
in
pecuniary
matters
as
it
turned
out
both
the
brothers
decided
to
marry
the
duke
of
kent
selecting
the
princess
of
in
preference
to
the
princess
of
baden
was
united
to
her
on
may
on
june
the
duke
of
clarence
followed
suit
with
a
daughter
of
the
duke
of
but
they
were
disappointed
in
their
financial
expectations
for
though
the
government
brought
forward
proposals
to
increase
their
allowances
together
with
that
of
the
duke
of
cumberland
the
motions
were
defeated
in
the
house
of
commons
at
this
the
duke
of
wellington
was
not
surprised
by
god
he
said
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
said
about
that
they
are
the
damnedest
millstones
about
the
necks
of
any
government
that
can
be
imagined
they
have
insulted
personally
insulted
of
the
gentlemen
of
england
and
how
can
it
be
wondered
at
that
they
take
their
revenge
upon
them
in
the
house
of
commons
it
is
their
only
opportunity
and
i
think
by
god
they
are
quite
right
to
use
it
eventually
however
parliament
increased
the
duke
of
kent
annuity
by
the
subsequent
history
of
madame
laurent
has
not
transpired
iv
the
new
duchess
of
kent
victoria
mary
louisa
was
a
daughter
of
francis
duke
of
and
a
sister
of
prince
leopold
the
family
was
an
ancient
one
being
a
branch
of
the
great
house
of
wettin
which
since
the
eleventh
century
had
ruled
over
the
march
of
meissen
on
the
elbe
in
the
fifteenth
century
the
whole
possessions
of
the
house
had
been
divided
between
the
albertine
and
ernestine
branches
from
the
former
descended
the
electors
and
kings
of
saxony
the
latter
ruling
over
thuringia
became
further
subdivided
into
five
branches
of
which
the
duchy
of
was
one
this
principality
was
very
small
containing
about
inhabitants
but
it
enjoyed
independent
and
sovereign
rights
during
the
disturbed
years
which
followed
the
french
revolution
its
affairs
became
terribly
involved
the
duke
was
extravagant
and
kept
open
house
for
the
swarms
of
refugees
who
fled
eastward
over
germany
as
the
french
power
advanced
among
these
was
the
prince
of
leiningen
an
elderly
beau
whose
domains
on
the
moselle
had
been
seized
by
the
french
but
who
was
granted
in
compensation
the
territory
of
amorbach
in
lower
franconia
in
he
married
the
princess
victoria
at
that
time
seventeen
years
of
age
three
years
later
duke
francis
died
a
ruined
man
the
napoleonic
harrow
passed
over
the
duchy
was
seized
by
the
french
and
the
ducal
family
were
reduced
to
beggary
almost
to
starvation
at
the
same
time
the
little
principality
of
amorbach
was
devastated
by
the
french
russian
and
austrian
armies
marching
and
across
it
for
years
there
was
hardly
a
cow
in
the
country
nor
enough
grass
to
feed
a
flock
of
geese
such
was
the
desperate
plight
of
the
family
which
a
generation
later
was
to
have
gained
a
foothold
in
half
the
reigning
houses
of
europe
the
napoleonic
harrow
had
indeed
done
its
work
the
seed
was
planted
and
the
crop
would
have
surprised
napoleon
prince
leopold
thrown
upon
his
own
resources
at
fifteen
made
a
career
for
himself
and
married
the
heiress
of
england
the
princess
of
leiningen
struggling
at
amorbach
with
poverty
military
requisitions
and
a
futile
husband
developed
an
independence
of
character
and
a
tenacity
of
purpose
which
were
to
prove
useful
in
very
different
circumstances
in
her
husband
died
leaving
her
with
two
children
and
the
regency
of
the
principality
after
her
brother
marriage
with
the
princess
charlotte
it
was
proposed
that
she
should
marry
the
duke
of
kent
but
she
declined
on
the
ground
that
the
guardianship
of
her
children
and
the
management
of
her
domains
made
other
ties
undesirable
the
princess
charlotte
death
however
altered
the
case
and
when
the
duke
of
kent
renewed
his
offer
she
accepted
it
she
was
years
old
short
stout
with
brown
eyes
and
hair
and
rosy
cheeks
cheerful
and
voluble
and
gorgeously
attired
in
rustling
silks
and
bright
velvets
she
was
certainly
fortunate
in
her
contented
disposition
for
she
was
fated
all
through
her
life
to
have
much
to
put
up
with
her
second
marriage
with
its
dubious
prospects
seemed
at
first
to
be
chiefly
a
source
of
difficulties
and
discomforts
the
duke
declaring
that
he
was
still
too
poor
to
live
in
england
moved
about
with
uneasy
precision
through
belgium
and
germany
attending
parades
and
inspecting
barracks
in
a
neat
military
cap
while
the
english
notabilities
looked
askance
and
the
duke
of
wellington
dubbed
him
the
corporal
god
damme
he
exclaimed
to
creevey
d
know
what
his
sisters
call
him
by
god
they
call
him
joseph
surface
at
valenciennes
where
there
was
a
review
and
a
great
dinner
the
duchess
arrived
with
an
old
and
ugly
and
the
duke
of
wellington
found
himself
in
a
difficulty
who
the
devil
is
to
take
out
the
maid
of
honour
he
kept
asking
but
at
last
he
thought
of
a
solution
damme
freemantle
find
out
the
mayor
and
let
him
do
it
so
the
mayor
of
valenciennes
was
brought
up
for
the
purpose
and
so
we
learn
from
creevey
a
capital
figure
he
was
a
few
days
later
at
brussels
creevey
himself
had
an
unfortunate
experience
a
military
school
was
to
be
inspected
before
breakfast
the
company
assembled
everything
was
highly
satisfactory
but
the
duke
of
kent
continued
for
so
long
examining
every
detail
and
asking
meticulous
question
after
meticulous
question
that
creevey
at
last
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
whispered
to
his
neighbour
that
he
was
damned
hungry
the
duke
of
wellington
heard
him
and
was
delighted
i
recommend
you
he
said
whenever
you
start
with
the
royal
family
in
a
morning
and
particularly
with
the
corporal
always
to
breakfast
first
he
and
his
staff
it
turned
out
had
taken
that
precaution
and
the
great
man
amused
himself
while
the
stream
of
royal
inquiries
poured
on
by
pointing
at
creevey
from
time
to
time
with
the
remark
voila
le
monsieur
qui
pas
dejeune
settled
down
at
last
at
amorbach
the
time
hung
heavily
on
the
hands
the
establishment
was
small
the
country
was
impoverished
even
grew
tedious
at
last
he
brooded
for
in
spite
of
his
piety
the
duke
was
not
without
a
vein
of
superstition
over
the
prophecy
of
a
gipsy
at
gibraltar
who
told
him
that
he
was
to
have
many
losses
and
crosses
that
he
was
to
die
in
happiness
and
that
his
only
child
was
to
be
a
great
queen
before
long
it
became
clear
that
a
child
was
to
be
expected
the
duke
decided
that
it
should
be
born
in
england
funds
were
lacking
for
the
journey
but
his
determination
was
not
to
be
set
aside
come
what
might
he
declared
his
child
must
be
a
carriage
was
hired
and
the
duke
himself
mounted
the
box
inside
were
the
duchess
her
daughter
feodora
a
girl
of
fourteen
with
maids
nurses
and
canaries
off
they
drove
through
germany
through
france
bad
roads
cheap
inns
were
nothing
to
the
rigorous
duke
and
the
equable
abundant
duchess
the
channel
was
crossed
london
was
reached
in
safety
the
authorities
provided
a
set
of
rooms
in
kensington
palace
and
there
on
may
a
female
infant
was
born
chapter
ii
childhood
i
the
child
who
in
these
not
very
impressive
circumstances
appeared
in
the
world
received
but
scant
attention
there
was
small
reason
to
foresee
her
destiny
the
duchess
of
clarence
two
months
before
had
given
birth
to
a
daughter
this
infant
indeed
had
died
almost
immediately
but
it
seemed
highly
probable
that
the
duchess
would
again
become
a
mother
and
so
it
actually
fell
out
more
than
this
the
duchess
of
kent
was
young
and
the
duke
was
strong
there
was
every
likelihood
that
before
long
a
brother
would
follow
to
snatch
her
faint
chance
of
the
succession
from
the
little
princess
nevertheless
the
duke
had
other
views
there
were
prophecies
at
any
rate
he
would
christen
the
child
elizabeth
a
name
of
happy
augury
in
this
however
he
reckoned
without
the
regent
who
seeing
a
chance
of
annoying
his
brother
suddenly
announced
that
he
himself
would
be
present
at
the
baptism
and
signified
at
the
same
time
that
one
of
the
godfathers
was
to
be
the
emperor
alexander
of
russia
and
so
when
the
ceremony
took
place
and
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
asked
by
what
name
he
was
to
baptise
the
child
the
regent
replied
alexandria
at
this
the
duke
ventured
to
suggest
that
another
name
might
be
added
certainly
said
the
regent
georgina
or
elizabeth
said
the
duke
there
was
a
pause
during
which
the
archbishop
with
the
baby
in
his
lawn
sleeves
looked
with
some
uneasiness
from
one
prince
to
the
other
very
well
then
said
the
regent
at
last
call
her
after
her
mother
but
alexandrina
must
come
first
thus
to
the
disgust
of
her
father
the
child
was
christened
alexandrina
victoria
the
duke
had
other
subjects
of
disgust
the
meagre
grant
of
the
commons
had
by
no
means
put
an
end
to
his
financial
distresses
it
was
to
be
feared
that
his
services
were
not
appreciated
by
the
nation
his
debts
continued
to
grow
for
many
years
he
had
lived
upon
a
year
but
now
his
expenses
were
exactly
doubled
he
could
make
no
further
reductions
as
it
was
there
was
not
a
single
servant
in
his
meagre
grant
establishment
who
was
idle
for
a
moment
from
morning
to
night
he
poured
out
his
griefs
in
a
long
letter
to
robert
owen
whose
sympathy
had
the
great
merit
of
being
practical
i
now
candidly
state
he
wrote
that
after
viewing
the
subject
in
every
possible
way
i
am
satisfied
that
to
continue
to
live
in
england
even
in
the
quiet
way
in
which
we
are
going
on
without
splendour
and
without
show
nothing
short
of
doubling
the
seven
thousand
pounds
will
do
reduction
being
impossible
it
was
clear
that
he
would
be
obliged
to
sell
his
house
for
if
that
failed
he
would
go
and
live
on
the
continent
if
my
services
are
useful
to
my
country
it
surely
becomes
those
who
have
the
power
to
support
me
in
substantiating
those
just
claims
i
have
for
the
very
extensive
losses
and
privations
i
have
experienced
during
the
very
long
period
of
my
professional
servitude
in
the
colonies
and
if
this
is
not
attainable
it
is
a
clear
proof
to
me
that
they
are
they
are
not
appreciated
and
under
that
impression
i
shall
not
scruple
in
due
time
to
resume
my
retirement
abroad
when
the
duchess
and
myself
shall
have
fulfilled
our
duties
in
establishing
the
english
birth
of
my
child
and
giving
it
material
nutriment
on
the
soil
of
old
england
and
which
we
shall
certainly
repeat
if
providence
destines
to
give
us
any
further
increase
of
family
in
the
meantime
he
decided
to
spend
the
winter
at
sidmouth
in
order
he
told
owen
that
the
duchess
may
have
the
benefit
of
tepid
sea
bathing
and
our
infant
that
of
sea
air
on
the
fine
coast
of
devonshire
during
the
months
of
the
year
that
are
so
odious
in
london
in
december
the
move
was
made
with
the
new
year
the
duke
remembered
another
prophecy
in
a
had
told
him
two
members
of
the
royal
family
would
die
who
would
they
be
he
speculated
on
the
various
possibilities
the
king
it
was
plain
could
not
live
much
longer
and
the
duchess
of
york
had
been
attacked
by
a
mortal
disease
probably
it
would
be
the
king
and
the
duchess
of
york
or
perhaps
the
king
and
the
duke
of
york
or
the
king
and
the
regent
he
himself
was
one
of
the
healthiest
men
in
england
my
brothers
he
declared
are
not
so
strong
as
i
am
i
have
lived
a
regular
life
i
shall
outlive
them
all
the
crown
will
come
to
me
and
my
children
he
went
out
for
a
walk
and
got
his
feet
wet
on
coming
home
he
neglected
to
change
his
stockings
he
caught
cold
inflammation
of
the
lungs
set
in
and
on
january
he
was
a
dying
man
by
a
curious
chance
young
stockmar
was
staying
in
the
house
at
the
time
two
years
before
he
had
stood
by
the
of
the
princess
charlotte
and
now
he
was
watching
the
duke
of
kent
in
his
agony
on
stockmar
advice
a
will
was
hastily
prepared
the
duke
earthly
possessions
were
of
a
negative
character
but
it
was
important
that
the
guardianship
of
the
unwitting
child
whose
fortunes
were
now
so
strangely
changing
should
be
assured
to
the
duchess
the
duke
was
just
able
to
understand
the
document
and
to
append
his
signature
having
inquired
whether
his
writing
was
perfectly
clear
he
became
unconscious
and
breathed
his
last
on
the
following
morning
six
days
later
came
the
fulfilment
of
the
second
half
of
the
gipsy
prophecy
the
long
unhappy
and
inglorious
life
of
george
the
third
of
england
was
ended
ii
such
was
the
confusion
of
affairs
at
sidmouth
that
the
duchess
found
herself
without
the
means
of
returning
to
london
prince
leopold
hurried
down
and
himself
conducted
his
sister
and
her
family
by
slow
and
bitter
stages
to
kensington
the
widowed
lady
in
her
voluminous
blacks
needed
all
her
equanimity
to
support
her
her
prospects
were
more
dubious
than
ever
she
had
a
year
of
her
own
but
her
husband
debts
loomed
before
her
like
a
mountain
soon
she
learnt
that
the
duchess
of
clarence
was
once
more
expecting
a
child
what
had
she
to
look
forward
to
in
england
why
should
she
remain
in
a
foreign
country
among
strangers
whose
language
she
could
not
speak
whose
customs
she
could
not
understand
surely
it
would
be
best
to
return
to
amorbach
and
there
among
her
own
people
bring
up
her
daughters
in
economical
obscurity
but
she
was
an
inveterate
optimist
she
had
spent
her
life
in
struggles
and
would
not
be
daunted
now
and
besides
she
adored
her
baby
mon
bonheur
mes
delices
mon
existence
she
declared
the
darling
should
be
brought
up
as
an
english
princess
whatever
lot
awaited
her
prince
leopold
came
forward
nobly
with
an
offer
of
an
additional
a
year
and
the
duchess
remained
at
kensington
the
child
herself
was
extremely
fat
and
bore
a
remarkable
resemblance
to
her
grandfather
du
feu
roi
exclaimed
the
duchess
le
roi
georges
en
jupons
echoed
the
surrounding
ladies
as
the
little
creature
waddled
with
difficulty
from
one
to
the
other
before
long
the
world
began
to
be
slightly
interested
in
the
nursery
at
kensington
when
early
in
the
duchess
of
clarence
second
child
the
princess
elizabeth
died
within
three
months
of
its
birth
the
interest
increased
great
forces
and
fierce
antagonisms
seemed
to
be
moving
obscurely
about
the
royal
cradle
it
was
a
time
of
faction
and
anger
of
violent
repression
and
profound
discontent
a
powerful
movement
which
had
for
long
been
checked
by
adverse
circumstances
was
now
spreading
throughout
the
country
new
passions
new
desires
were
abroad
or
rather
old
passions
and
old
desires
reincarnated
with
a
new
potency
love
of
freedom
hatred
of
injustice
hope
for
the
future
of
man
the
mighty
still
sat
proudly
in
their
seats
dispensing
their
ancient
tyranny
but
a
storm
was
gathering
out
of
the
darkness
and
already
there
was
lightning
in
the
sky
but
the
vastest
forces
must
needs
operate
through
frail
human
instruments
and
it
seemed
for
many
years
as
if
the
great
cause
of
english
liberalism
hung
upon
the
life
of
the
little
girl
at
kensington
she
alone
stood
between
the
country
and
her
terrible
uncle
the
duke
of
cumberland
the
hideous
embodiment
of
reaction
inevitably
the
duchess
of
kent
threw
in
her
lot
with
her
husband
party
whig
leaders
radical
agitators
rallied
round
her
she
was
intimate
with
the
bold
lord
durham
she
was
on
friendly
terms
with
the
redoubtable
himself
she
received
to
be
sure
she
did
not
ask
him
to
sit
down
she
declared
in
public
that
she
put
her
faith
in
the
liberties
of
the
people
it
was
certain
that
the
young
princess
would
be
brought
up
in
the
way
that
she
should
go
yet
there
close
behind
the
throne
waiting
sinister
was
the
duke
of
cumberland
brougham
looking
forward
into
the
future
in
his
scurrilous
fashion
hinted
at
dreadful
possibilities
i
never
prayed
so
heartily
for
a
prince
before
he
wrote
on
hearing
that
george
iv
had
been
attacked
by
illness
if
he
had
gone
all
the
troubles
of
these
villains
the
tory
ministers
went
with
him
and
they
had
fred
i
the
duke
of
york
their
own
man
for
his
life
he
fred
i
wo
live
long
either
that
prince
of
blackguards
william
is
as
bad
a
life
so
we
come
in
the
course
of
nature
to
be
assassinated
by
king
ernest
i
or
regent
ernest
the
duke
of
cumberland
such
thoughts
were
not
peculiar
to
brougham
in
the
seething
state
of
public
feeling
they
constantly
leapt
to
the
surface
and
even
so
late
as
the
year
previous
to
her
accession
the
radical
newspapers
were
full
of
suggestions
that
the
princess
victoria
was
in
danger
from
the
machinations
of
her
wicked
uncle
but
no
echo
of
these
conflicts
and
forebodings
reached
the
little
drina
for
so
she
was
called
in
the
family
circle
as
she
played
with
her
dolls
or
scampered
down
the
passages
or
rode
on
the
donkey
her
uncle
york
had
given
her
along
the
avenues
of
kensington
gardens
the
child
was
idolised
by
her
nurses
and
her
mother
ladies
and
her
sister
feodora
and
for
a
few
years
there
was
danger
in
spite
of
her
mother
strictness
of
her
being
spoilt
from
time
to
time
she
would
fly
into
a
violent
passion
stamp
her
little
foot
and
set
everyone
at
defiance
whatever
they
might
say
she
would
not
learn
her
letters
no
she
would
not
afterwards
she
was
very
sorry
and
burst
into
tears
but
her
letters
remained
unlearnt
when
she
was
five
years
old
however
a
change
came
with
the
appearance
of
fraulein
lehzen
this
lady
who
was
the
daughter
of
a
hanoverian
clergyman
and
had
previously
been
the
princess
feodora
governess
soon
succeeded
in
instilling
a
new
spirit
into
her
charge
at
first
indeed
she
was
appalled
by
the
little
princess
outbursts
of
temper
never
in
her
life
she
declared
had
she
seen
such
a
passionate
and
naughty
child
then
she
observed
something
else
the
child
was
extraordinarily
truthful
whatever
punishment
might
follow
she
never
told
a
lie
firm
very
firm
the
new
governess
yet
had
the
sense
to
see
that
all
the
firmness
in
the
world
would
be
useless
unless
she
could
win
her
way
into
little
drina
heart
she
did
so
and
there
were
no
more
difficulties
drina
learnt
her
letters
like
an
angel
and
she
learnt
other
things
as
well
the
baroness
de
spath
taught
her
how
to
make
little
board
boxes
and
decorate
them
with
tinsel
and
painted
flowers
her
mother
taught
her
religion
sitting
in
the
pew
every
sunday
morning
the
child
of
six
was
seen
listening
in
rapt
attention
to
the
clergyman
endless
sermon
for
she
was
to
be
examined
upon
it
in
the
afternoon
the
duchess
was
determined
that
her
daughter
from
the
earliest
possible
moment
should
be
prepared
for
her
high
station
in
a
way
that
would
commend
itself
to
the
most
respectable
her
good
plain
thrifty
german
mind
recoiled
with
horror
and
amazement
from
the
shameless
junketings
at
carlton
house
drina
should
never
be
allowed
to
forget
for
a
moment
the
virtues
of
simplicity
regularity
propriety
and
devotion
the
little
girl
however
was
really
in
small
need
of
such
lessons
for
she
was
naturally
simple
and
orderly
she
was
pious
without
difficulty
and
her
sense
of
propriety
was
keen
she
understood
very
well
the
niceties
of
her
own
position
when
a
child
of
six
lady
jane
ellice
was
taken
by
her
grandmother
to
kensington
palace
she
was
put
to
play
with
the
princess
victoria
who
was
the
same
age
as
herself
the
young
visitor
ignorant
of
etiquette
began
to
make
free
with
the
toys
on
the
floor
in
a
way
which
was
a
little
too
familiar
but
you
must
not
touch
those
she
was
quickly
told
they
are
mine
and
i
may
call
you
jane
but
you
must
not
call
me
victoria
the
princess
most
constant
playmate
was
victoire
the
daughter
of
sir
john
conroy
the
duchess
the
two
girls
were
very
fond
of
one
another
they
would
walk
hand
in
hand
together
in
kensington
gardens
but
little
drina
was
perfectly
aware
for
which
of
them
it
was
that
they
were
followed
at
a
respectful
distance
by
a
gigantic
scarlet
flunkey
responsive
she
loved
her
dear
lehzen
and
she
loved
her
dear
feodora
and
her
dear
victoire
and
her
dear
madame
de
spath
and
her
dear
mamma
of
course
she
loved
her
too
it
was
her
duty
and
yet
she
could
not
tell
why
it
was
she
was
always
happier
when
she
was
staying
with
her
uncle
leopold
at
claremont
there
old
louis
who
years
ago
had
waited
on
her
cousin
charlotte
petted
her
to
her
content
and
her
uncle
himself
was
wonderfully
kind
to
her
talking
to
her
seriously
and
gently
almost
as
if
she
were
a
person
she
and
feodora
invariably
wept
when
the
visit
was
over
and
they
were
obliged
to
return
to
the
dutiful
monotony
and
the
affectionate
supervision
of
kensington
but
sometimes
when
her
mother
had
to
stay
at
home
she
was
allowed
to
go
out
driving
all
alone
with
her
dear
feodora
and
her
dear
lehzen
and
she
could
talk
and
look
as
she
liked
and
it
was
very
delightful
the
visits
to
claremont
were
frequent
enough
but
one
day
on
a
special
occasion
she
paid
one
of
a
rarer
and
more
exciting
kind
when
she
was
seven
years
old
she
and
her
mother
and
sister
were
asked
by
the
king
to
go
down
to
windsor
george
iv
who
had
transferred
his
fraternal
to
his
and
her
family
had
at
last
grown
tired
of
sulking
and
decided
to
be
agreeable
the
old
rip
bewigged
and
gouty
ornate
and
enormous
with
his
jewelled
mistress
by
his
side
and
his
flaunting
court
about
him
received
the
tiny
creature
who
was
one
day
to
hold
in
those
same
halls
a
very
different
state
give
me
your
little
paw
he
said
and
two
ages
touched
next
morning
driving
in
his
phaeton
with
the
duchess
of
gloucester
he
met
the
duchess
of
kent
and
her
child
in
the
park
pop
her
in
were
his
orders
which
to
the
terror
of
the
mother
and
the
delight
of
the
daughter
were
immediately
obeyed
off
they
dashed
to
virginia
water
where
there
was
a
great
barge
full
of
lords
and
ladies
fishing
and
another
barge
with
a
band
and
the
king
ogled
feodora
and
praised
her
manners
and
then
turned
to
his
own
small
niece
what
is
your
favourite
tune
the
band
shall
play
it
god
save
the
king
sir
was
the
instant
answer
the
reply
has
been
praised
as
an
early
example
of
a
tact
which
was
afterwards
famous
but
she
was
a
very
truthful
child
and
perhaps
it
was
her
genuine
opinion
iii
in
the
duke
of
york
who
had
found
some
consolation
for
the
loss
of
his
wife
in
the
sympathy
of
the
duchess
of
rutland
died
leaving
behind
him
the
unfinished
immensity
of
stafford
house
and
worth
of
debts
three
years
later
george
iv
also
disappeared
and
the
duke
of
clarence
reigned
in
his
stead
the
new
queen
it
was
now
clear
would
in
all
probability
never
again
be
a
mother
the
princess
victoria
therefore
was
recognised
by
parliament
as
and
the
duchess
of
kent
whose
annuity
had
been
doubled
five
years
previously
was
now
given
an
additional
for
the
maintenance
of
the
princess
and
was
appointed
regent
in
case
of
the
death
of
the
king
before
the
majority
of
her
daughter
at
the
same
time
a
great
convulsion
took
place
in
the
constitution
of
the
state
the
power
of
the
tories
who
had
dominated
england
for
more
than
forty
years
suddenly
began
to
crumble
in
the
tremendous
struggle
that
followed
it
seemed
for
a
moment
as
if
the
tradition
of
generations
might
be
snapped
as
if
the
blind
tenacity
of
the
reactionaries
and
the
determined
fury
of
their
enemies
could
have
no
other
issue
than
revolution
but
the
forces
of
compromise
triumphed
the
reform
bill
was
passed
the
centre
of
gravity
in
the
constitution
was
shifted
towards
the
middle
classes
the
whigs
came
into
power
and
the
complexion
of
the
government
assumed
a
liberal
tinge
one
of
the
results
of
this
new
state
of
affairs
was
a
change
in
the
position
of
the
duchess
of
kent
and
her
daughter
from
being
the
protegees
of
an
opposition
clique
they
became
assets
of
the
official
majority
of
the
nation
the
princess
victoria
was
henceforward
the
living
symbol
of
the
victory
of
the
middle
classes
the
duke
of
cumberland
on
the
other
hand
suffered
a
corresponding
eclipse
his
claws
had
been
pared
by
the
reform
act
he
grew
insignificant
and
almost
harmless
though
his
ugliness
remained
he
was
the
wicked
uncle
still
but
only
of
a
story
the
duchess
own
liberalism
was
not
very
profound
she
followed
naturally
in
the
footsteps
of
her
husband
repeating
with
conviction
the
catchwords
of
her
husband
clever
friends
and
the
generalisations
of
her
clever
brother
leopold
she
herself
had
no
pretensions
to
cleverness
she
did
not
understand
very
much
about
the
poor
law
and
the
slave
trade
and
political
economy
but
she
hoped
that
she
did
her
duty
and
she
hoped
she
ardently
hoped
that
the
same
might
be
said
of
victoria
her
educational
conceptions
were
those
of
arnold
whose
views
were
just
then
beginning
to
permeate
society
arnold
object
was
first
and
foremost
to
make
his
pupils
in
the
highest
and
truest
sense
of
the
words
christian
gentlemen
intellectual
refinements
might
follow
the
duchess
felt
convinced
that
it
was
her
supreme
duty
in
life
to
make
quite
sure
that
her
daughter
should
grow
up
into
a
christian
queen
to
this
task
she
bent
all
her
energies
and
as
the
child
developed
she
flattered
herself
that
her
efforts
were
not
unsuccessful
when
the
princess
was
eleven
she
desired
the
bishops
of
london
and
lincoln
to
submit
her
daughter
to
an
examination
and
report
upon
the
progress
that
had
been
made
i
feel
the
time
to
be
now
come
the
duchess
explained
in
a
letter
obviously
drawn
up
by
her
own
hand
that
what
has
been
done
should
be
put
to
some
test
that
if
anything
has
been
done
in
error
of
judgment
it
may
be
corrected
and
that
the
plan
for
the
future
should
be
open
to
consideration
and
revision
i
attend
almost
always
myself
every
lesson
or
a
part
and
as
the
lady
about
the
princess
is
a
competent
person
she
assists
her
in
preparing
her
lessons
for
the
various
masters
as
i
resolved
to
act
in
that
manner
so
as
to
be
her
governess
myself
when
she
was
at
a
proper
age
she
commenced
attending
divine
service
regularly
with
me
and
i
have
every
feeling
that
she
has
religion
at
her
heart
that
she
is
morally
impressed
with
it
to
that
degree
that
she
is
less
liable
to
error
by
its
application
to
her
feelings
as
a
child
capable
of
reflection
the
general
bent
of
her
character
added
the
duchess
is
strength
of
intellect
capable
of
receiving
with
ease
information
and
with
a
peculiar
readiness
in
coming
to
a
very
just
and
benignant
decision
on
any
point
her
opinion
is
asked
on
her
adherence
to
truth
is
of
so
marked
a
character
that
i
feel
no
apprehension
of
that
bulwark
being
broken
down
by
any
circumstances
the
bishops
attended
at
the
palace
and
the
result
of
their
examination
was
all
that
could
be
wished
in
answering
a
great
variety
of
questions
proposed
to
her
they
reported
the
princess
displayed
an
accurate
knowledge
of
the
most
important
features
of
scripture
history
and
of
the
leading
truths
and
precepts
of
the
christian
religion
as
taught
by
the
church
of
england
as
well
as
an
acquaintance
with
the
chronology
and
principal
facts
of
english
history
remarkable
in
so
young
a
person
to
questions
in
geography
the
use
of
the
globes
arithmetic
and
latin
grammar
the
answers
which
the
princess
returned
were
equally
satisfactory
they
did
not
believe
that
the
duchess
plan
of
education
was
susceptible
of
any
improvement
and
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
who
was
also
consulted
came
to
the
same
gratifying
conclusion
one
important
step
however
remained
to
be
taken
so
far
as
the
duchess
explained
to
the
bishops
the
princess
had
been
kept
in
ignorance
of
the
station
that
she
was
likely
to
fill
she
is
aware
of
its
duties
and
that
a
sovereign
should
live
for
others
so
that
when
her
innocent
mind
receives
the
impression
of
her
future
fate
she
receives
it
with
a
mind
formed
to
be
sensible
of
what
is
to
be
expected
from
her
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
she
will
be
too
well
grounded
in
her
principles
to
be
dazzled
with
the
station
she
is
to
look
to
in
the
following
year
it
was
decided
that
she
should
be
enlightened
on
this
point
the
well
known
scene
followed
the
history
lesson
the
genealogical
table
of
the
kings
of
england
slipped
beforehand
by
the
governess
into
the
book
the
princess
surprise
her
inquiries
her
final
realisation
of
the
facts
when
the
child
at
last
understood
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
she
spoke
i
will
be
good
she
said
the
words
were
something
more
than
a
conventional
protestation
something
more
than
the
expression
of
a
superimposed
desire
they
were
in
their
limitation
and
their
intensity
their
egotism
and
their
humility
an
instinctive
summary
of
the
dominating
qualities
of
a
life
i
cried
much
on
learning
it
her
majesty
noted
long
afterwards
no
doubt
while
the
others
were
present
even
her
dear
lehzen
the
little
girl
kept
up
her
and
then
crept
away
somewhere
to
ease
her
heart
of
an
inward
unfamiliar
agitation
with
a
handkerchief
out
of
her
mother
sight
but
her
mother
sight
was
by
no
means
an
easy
thing
to
escape
morning
and
evening
day
and
night
there
was
no
relaxation
of
the
maternal
vigilance
the
child
grew
into
the
girl
the
girl
into
the
young
woman
but
still
she
slept
in
her
mother
bedroom
still
she
had
no
place
allowed
her
where
she
might
sit
or
work
by
herself
an
extraordinary
watchfulness
surrounded
her
every
step
up
to
the
day
of
her
accession
she
never
went
downstairs
without
someone
beside
her
holding
her
hand
plainness
and
regularity
ruled
the
household
the
hours
the
days
the
years
passed
slowly
and
methodically
by
the
dolls
the
innumerable
dolls
each
one
so
neatly
dressed
each
one
with
its
name
so
punctiliously
entered
in
the
catalogue
were
laid
aside
and
a
little
music
and
a
little
dancing
took
their
place
taglioni
came
to
give
grace
and
dignity
to
the
figure
and
lablache
to
train
the
piping
treble
upon
his
own
rich
bass
the
dean
of
chester
the
official
preceptor
continued
his
endless
instruction
in
scripture
history
while
the
duchess
of
northumberland
the
official
governess
presided
over
every
lesson
with
becoming
solemnity
without
doubt
the
princess
main
achievement
during
her
was
linguistic
german
was
naturally
the
first
language
with
which
she
was
familiar
but
english
and
french
quickly
followed
and
she
became
virtually
trilingual
though
her
mastery
of
english
grammar
remained
incomplete
at
the
same
time
she
acquired
a
working
knowledge
of
italian
and
some
smattering
of
latin
nevertheless
she
did
not
read
very
much
it
was
not
an
occupation
that
she
cared
for
partly
perhaps
because
the
books
that
were
given
her
were
all
either
sermons
which
were
very
dull
or
poetry
which
was
incomprehensible
novels
were
strictly
forbidden
lord
durham
persuaded
her
mother
to
get
her
some
of
miss
martineau
tales
illustrating
the
truths
of
political
economy
and
they
delighted
her
but
it
is
to
be
feared
that
it
was
the
unaccustomed
pleasure
of
the
story
that
filled
her
mind
and
that
she
never
really
mastered
the
theory
of
exchanges
or
the
nature
of
rent
it
was
her
misfortune
that
the
mental
atmosphere
which
surrounded
her
during
these
years
of
adolescence
was
almost
entirely
feminine
no
father
no
brother
was
there
to
break
in
upon
the
gentle
monotony
of
the
daily
round
with
impetuosity
with
rudeness
with
careless
laughter
and
wafts
of
freedom
from
the
outside
world
the
princess
was
never
called
by
a
voice
that
was
loud
and
growling
never
felt
as
a
matter
of
course
a
hard
rough
cheek
on
her
own
soft
one
never
climbed
a
wall
with
a
boy
the
visits
to
claremont
delicious
little
escapes
into
male
society
came
to
an
end
when
she
was
eleven
years
old
and
prince
leopold
left
england
to
be
king
of
the
belgians
she
loved
him
still
he
was
still
il
mio
secondo
padre
or
rather
solo
padre
for
he
is
indeed
like
my
real
father
as
i
have
none
but
his
fatherliness
now
came
to
her
dimly
and
indirectly
through
the
cold
channel
of
correspondence
henceforward
female
duty
female
elegance
female
enthusiasm
hemmed
her
completely
in
and
her
spirit
amid
the
enclosing
folds
was
hardly
reached
by
those
two
great
influences
without
which
no
growing
life
can
truly
prosper
humour
and
imagination
the
baroness
lehzen
for
she
had
been
raised
to
that
rank
in
the
hanoverian
nobility
by
george
iv
before
he
died
was
the
real
centre
of
the
princess
world
when
feodora
married
when
uncle
leopold
went
to
belgium
the
baroness
was
left
without
a
competitor
the
princess
gave
her
mother
her
dutiful
regards
but
lehzen
had
her
heart
the
voluble
shrewd
daughter
of
the
pastor
in
hanover
lavishing
her
devotion
on
her
royal
charge
had
reaped
her
reward
in
an
unbounded
confidence
and
a
passionate
adoration
the
girl
would
have
gone
through
fire
for
her
precious
lehzen
the
best
and
truest
friend
she
declared
that
she
had
had
since
her
birth
her
journal
begun
when
she
was
thirteen
where
she
registered
day
by
day
the
small
succession
of
her
doings
and
her
sentiments
bears
on
every
page
of
it
the
traces
of
the
baroness
and
her
circumambient
influence
the
young
creature
that
one
sees
there
in
ingenuous
clarity
with
her
sincerity
her
simplicity
her
quick
affections
and
pious
resolutions
might
almost
have
been
the
daughter
of
a
german
pastor
herself
her
enjoyments
her
admirations
her
engouements
were
of
the
kind
that
clothed
themselves
naturally
in
underlinings
and
exclamation
marks
it
was
a
delightful
ride
we
cantered
a
good
deal
sweet
little
rosy
went
beautifully
we
came
home
at
a
past
at
minutes
to
we
went
out
to
the
opera
rubini
came
on
and
sang
a
song
out
of
boulena
quite
beautifully
we
came
home
at
past
in
her
comments
on
her
readings
the
mind
of
the
baroness
is
clearly
revealed
one
day
by
some
mistake
she
was
allowed
to
take
up
a
volume
of
memoirs
by
fanny
kemble
it
is
certainly
very
pertly
and
oddly
written
one
would
imagine
by
the
style
that
the
authoress
must
be
very
pert
and
not
well
bred
for
there
are
so
many
vulgar
expressions
in
it
it
is
a
great
pity
that
a
person
endowed
with
so
much
talent
as
butler
really
is
should
turn
it
to
so
little
account
and
publish
a
book
which
is
so
full
of
trash
and
nonsense
which
can
only
do
her
harm
i
stayed
up
till
minutes
past
madame
de
sevigne
letters
which
the
baroness
read
aloud
met
with
more
approval
how
truly
elegant
and
natural
her
style
is
it
is
so
full
of
naivete
cleverness
and
grace
but
her
highest
admiration
was
reserved
for
the
bishop
of
of
the
gospel
of
st
matthew
it
is
a
very
fine
book
indeed
just
the
sort
of
one
i
like
which
is
just
plain
and
comprehensible
and
full
of
truth
and
good
feeling
it
is
not
one
of
those
learned
books
in
which
you
have
to
cavil
at
almost
every
paragraph
lehzen
gave
it
me
on
the
sunday
that
i
took
the
sacrament
a
few
weeks
previously
she
had
been
confirmed
and
she
described
the
event
as
follows
i
felt
that
my
confirmation
was
one
of
the
most
solemn
and
important
events
and
acts
in
my
life
and
that
i
trusted
that
it
might
have
a
salutary
effect
on
my
mind
i
felt
deeply
repentant
for
all
what
i
had
done
which
was
wrong
and
trusted
in
god
almighty
to
strengthen
my
heart
and
mind
and
to
forsake
all
that
is
bad
and
follow
all
that
is
virtuous
and
right
i
went
with
the
firm
determination
to
become
a
true
christian
to
try
and
comfort
my
dear
mamma
in
all
her
griefs
trials
and
anxieties
and
to
become
a
dutiful
and
affectionate
daughter
to
her
also
to
be
obedient
to
dear
lehzen
who
has
done
so
much
for
me
i
was
dressed
in
a
white
lace
dress
with
a
white
crepe
bonnet
with
a
wreath
of
white
roses
round
it
i
went
in
the
chariot
with
my
dear
mamma
and
the
others
followed
in
another
carriage
one
seems
to
hold
in
hand
a
small
smooth
crystal
pebble
without
a
flaw
and
without
a
scintillation
and
so
transparent
that
one
can
see
through
it
at
a
glance
yet
perhaps
after
all
to
the
discerning
eye
the
purity
would
not
be
absolute
the
careful
searcher
might
detect
in
the
virgin
soil
the
first
faint
traces
of
an
unexpected
vein
in
that
conventual
existence
visits
were
exciting
events
and
as
the
duchess
had
many
relatives
they
were
not
infrequent
aunts
and
uncles
would
often
appear
from
germany
and
cousins
too
when
the
princess
was
fourteen
she
was
delighted
by
the
arrival
of
a
couple
of
boys
from
wurtemberg
the
princes
alexander
and
ernst
sons
of
her
mother
sister
and
the
reigning
duke
they
are
both
extremely
tall
she
noted
alexander
is
very
handsome
and
ernst
has
a
very
kind
expression
they
are
both
extremely
amiable
and
their
departure
filled
her
with
corresponding
regrets
we
saw
them
get
into
the
barge
and
watched
them
sailing
away
for
some
time
on
the
beach
they
were
so
amiable
and
so
pleasant
to
have
in
the
house
they
were
always
satisfied
always
alexander
took
such
care
of
me
in
getting
out
of
the
boat
and
rode
next
to
me
so
did
ernst
two
years
later
two
other
cousins
arrived
the
princes
ferdinand
and
augustus
dear
ferdinand
the
princess
wrote
has
elicited
universal
admiration
from
all
parties
he
is
so
very
unaffected
and
has
such
a
very
distinguished
appearance
and
carriage
they
are
both
very
dear
and
charming
young
men
augustus
is
very
amiable
too
and
when
known
shows
much
good
sense
on
another
occasion
dear
ferdinand
came
and
sat
near
me
and
talked
so
dearly
and
sensibly
i
do
so
love
him
dear
augustus
sat
near
me
and
talked
with
me
and
he
is
also
a
dear
good
young
man
and
is
very
handsome
she
could
not
quite
decide
which
was
the
handsomer
of
the
two
on
the
whole
she
concluded
i
think
ferdinand
handsomer
than
augustus
his
eyes
are
so
beautiful
and
he
has
such
a
lively
clever
expression
both
have
such
a
sweet
expression
ferdinand
has
something
quite
beautiful
in
his
expression
when
he
speaks
and
smiles
and
he
is
so
good
however
it
was
perhaps
best
to
say
that
they
were
both
very
handsome
and
very
dear
but
shortly
afterwards
two
more
cousins
arrived
who
threw
all
the
rest
into
the
shade
these
were
the
princes
ernest
and
albert
sons
of
her
mother
eldest
brother
the
duke
of
this
time
the
princess
was
more
particular
in
her
observations
ernest
she
remarked
is
as
tall
as
ferdinand
and
augustus
he
has
dark
hair
and
fine
dark
eyes
and
eyebrows
but
the
nose
and
mouth
are
not
good
he
has
a
most
kind
honest
and
intelligent
expression
in
his
countenance
and
has
a
very
good
figure
albert
who
is
just
as
tall
as
ernest
but
stouter
is
extremely
handsome
his
hair
is
about
the
same
colour
as
mine
his
eyes
are
large
and
blue
and
he
has
a
beautiful
nose
and
a
very
sweet
mouth
with
fine
teeth
but
the
charm
of
his
countenance
is
his
expression
which
is
most
delightful
a
la
fois
full
of
goodness
and
sweetness
and
very
clever
and
intelligent
both
my
cousins
she
added
are
so
kind
and
good
they
are
much
more
formes
and
men
of
the
world
than
augustus
they
speak
english
very
well
and
i
speak
it
with
them
ernest
will
be
years
old
on
the
of
june
and
albert
on
the
of
august
dear
uncle
ernest
made
me
the
present
of
a
most
delightful
lory
which
is
so
tame
that
it
remains
on
your
hand
and
you
may
put
your
finger
into
its
beak
or
do
anything
with
it
without
its
ever
attempting
to
bite
it
is
larger
than
mamma
grey
parrot
a
little
later
i
sat
between
my
dear
cousins
on
the
sofa
and
we
looked
at
drawings
they
both
draw
very
well
particularly
albert
and
are
both
exceedingly
fond
of
music
they
play
very
nicely
on
the
piano
the
more
i
see
them
the
more
i
am
delighted
with
them
and
the
more
i
love
them
it
is
delightful
to
be
with
them
they
are
so
fond
of
being
occupied
too
they
are
quite
an
example
for
any
young
person
when
after
a
stay
of
three
weeks
the
time
came
for
the
young
men
and
their
father
to
return
to
germany
the
moment
of
parting
was
a
melancholy
one
it
was
our
last
happy
happy
breakfast
with
this
dear
uncle
and
those
dearest
beloved
cousins
whom
i
do
love
so
very
very
dearly
much
more
dearly
than
any
other
cousins
in
the
world
dearly
as
i
love
ferdinand
and
also
good
augustus
i
love
ernest
and
albert
more
than
them
oh
yes
much
more
they
have
both
learnt
a
good
deal
and
are
very
clever
naturally
clever
particularly
albert
who
is
the
most
reflecting
of
the
two
and
they
like
very
much
talking
about
serious
and
instructive
things
and
yet
are
so
very
very
merry
and
gay
and
happy
like
young
people
ought
to
be
albert
always
used
to
have
some
fun
and
some
clever
witty
answer
at
breakfast
and
everywhere
he
used
to
play
and
fondle
dash
so
funnily
too
dearest
albert
was
playing
on
the
piano
when
i
came
down
at
dear
uncle
my
dearest
beloved
cousins
and
charles
left
us
accompanied
by
count
kolowrat
i
embraced
both
my
dearest
cousins
most
warmly
as
also
my
dear
uncle
i
cried
bitterly
very
bitterly
the
princes
shared
her
ecstasies
and
her
italics
between
them
but
it
is
clear
enough
where
her
secret
preference
lay
particularly
albert
she
was
just
seventeen
and
deep
was
the
impression
left
upon
that
budding
organism
by
the
young
man
charm
and
goodness
and
accomplishments
and
his
large
blue
eyes
and
beautiful
nose
and
his
sweet
mouth
and
fine
teeth
iv
king
william
could
not
away
with
his
and
the
duchess
fully
returned
his
antipathy
without
considerable
tact
and
considerable
forbearance
their
relative
positions
were
well
calculated
to
cause
and
there
was
very
little
tact
in
the
composition
of
the
duchess
and
no
forbearance
at
all
in
that
of
his
majesty
a
bursting
bubbling
old
gentleman
with
quarterdeck
gestures
round
rolling
eyes
and
a
head
like
a
pineapple
his
sudden
elevation
to
the
throne
after
years
of
utter
insignificance
had
almost
sent
him
crazy
his
natural
exuberance
completely
got
the
best
of
him
he
rushed
about
doing
preposterous
things
in
an
extraordinary
manner
spreading
amusement
and
terror
in
every
direction
and
talking
all
the
time
his
tongue
was
decidedly
hanoverian
with
its
repetitions
its
catchwords
quite
another
thing
that
quite
another
thing
its
rattling
indomitability
its
loud
indiscreetness
his
speeches
made
repeatedly
at
the
most
inopportune
junctures
and
filled
with
all
the
fancies
and
furies
that
happened
at
the
moment
to
be
whisking
about
in
his
head
were
the
consternation
of
ministers
he
was
one
part
blackguard
people
said
and
three
parts
buffoon
but
those
who
knew
him
better
could
not
help
liking
him
he
meant
well
and
he
was
really
and
if
you
took
him
the
right
way
if
you
took
him
the
wrong
way
however
you
must
look
out
for
squalls
as
the
duchess
of
kent
discovered
she
had
no
notion
of
how
to
deal
with
him
could
not
understand
him
in
the
least
occupied
with
her
own
position
her
own
responsibilities
her
duty
and
her
daughter
she
had
no
attention
to
spare
for
the
peppery
susceptibilities
of
a
foolish
disreputable
old
man
she
was
the
mother
of
the
heiress
of
england
and
it
was
for
him
to
recognise
the
fact
to
put
her
at
once
upon
a
proper
footing
to
give
her
the
precedence
of
a
dowager
princess
of
wales
with
a
large
annuity
from
the
privy
purse
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
such
pretensions
might
be
galling
to
a
king
who
had
no
legitimate
child
of
his
own
and
who
yet
had
not
altogether
abandoned
the
hope
of
having
one
she
pressed
on
with
bulky
vigour
along
the
course
she
had
laid
out
sir
john
conroy
an
irishman
with
no
judgment
and
a
great
deal
of
was
her
intimate
counsellor
and
egged
her
on
it
was
advisable
that
victoria
should
become
acquainted
with
the
various
districts
of
england
and
through
several
summers
a
succession
of
tours
in
the
west
in
the
midlands
in
wales
were
arranged
for
her
the
intention
of
the
plan
was
excellent
but
its
execution
was
unfortunate
the
journeys
advertised
in
the
press
attracting
enthusiastic
crowds
and
involving
official
receptions
took
on
the
air
of
royal
progresses
addresses
were
presented
by
loyal
citizens
the
delighted
duchess
swelling
in
sweeping
feathers
and
almost
obliterating
the
diminutive
princess
read
aloud
in
her
german
accent
gracious
replies
prepared
beforehand
by
sir
john
who
bustling
and
ridiculous
seemed
to
be
mingling
the
roles
of
and
prime
minister
naturally
the
king
fumed
over
his
newspaper
at
windsor
that
woman
is
a
nuisance
he
exclaimed
poor
queen
adelaide
amiable
though
disappointed
did
her
best
to
smooth
things
down
changed
the
subject
and
wrote
affectionate
letters
to
victoria
but
it
was
useless
news
arrived
that
the
duchess
of
kent
sailing
in
the
solent
had
insisted
that
whenever
her
yacht
appeared
it
should
be
received
by
royal
salutes
from
all
the
and
all
the
forts
the
king
declared
that
these
continual
poppings
must
cease
the
premier
and
the
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
were
consulted
and
they
wrote
privately
to
the
duchess
begging
her
to
waive
her
rights
but
she
would
not
hear
of
it
sir
john
conroy
was
adamant
as
her
royal
highness
confidential
adviser
he
said
i
can
not
recommend
her
to
give
way
on
this
point
eventually
the
king
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
issued
a
special
order
in
council
prohibiting
the
firing
of
royal
salutes
to
any
ships
except
those
which
carried
the
reigning
sovereign
or
his
consort
on
board
when
king
william
quarrelled
with
his
whig
ministers
the
situation
grew
still
more
embittered
for
now
the
duchess
in
addition
to
her
other
shortcomings
was
the
political
partisan
of
his
enemies
in
he
made
an
attempt
to
prepare
the
ground
for
a
match
between
the
princess
victoria
and
one
of
the
sons
of
the
prince
of
orange
and
at
the
same
time
did
his
best
to
prevent
the
visit
of
the
young
coburg
princes
to
kensington
he
failed
in
both
these
objects
and
the
only
result
of
his
efforts
was
to
raise
the
anger
of
the
king
of
the
belgians
who
forgetting
for
a
moment
his
royal
reserve
addressed
an
indignant
letter
on
the
subject
to
his
niece
i
am
really
astonished
he
wrote
at
the
conduct
of
your
old
uncle
the
king
this
invitation
of
the
prince
of
orange
and
his
sons
this
forcing
him
on
others
is
very
extraordinary
not
later
than
yesterday
i
got
a
communication
from
england
insinuating
that
it
would
be
highly
desirable
that
the
visit
of
your
relatives
should
not
take
place
this
year
the
relations
of
the
queen
and
the
king
therefore
to
the
degree
are
to
come
in
shoals
and
rule
the
land
when
your
relations
are
to
be
forbidden
the
country
and
that
when
as
you
know
the
whole
of
your
relations
have
ever
been
very
dutiful
and
kind
to
the
king
really
and
truly
i
never
heard
or
saw
anything
like
it
and
i
hope
it
will
a
little
rouse
your
spirit
now
that
slavery
is
even
abolished
in
the
british
colonies
i
do
not
comprehend
why
your
lot
alone
should
be
to
be
kept
a
white
little
slavey
in
england
for
the
pleasure
of
the
court
who
never
bought
you
as
i
am
not
aware
of
their
ever
having
gone
to
any
expense
on
that
head
or
the
king
ever
having
spent
a
sixpence
for
your
existence
oh
consistency
and
political
or
other
honesty
where
must
one
look
for
you
shortly
afterwards
king
leopold
came
to
england
himself
and
his
reception
was
as
cold
at
windsor
as
it
was
warm
at
kensington
to
hear
dear
uncle
speak
on
any
subject
the
princess
wrote
in
her
diary
is
like
reading
a
highly
instructive
book
his
conversation
is
so
enlightened
so
clear
he
is
universally
admitted
to
be
one
of
the
first
politicians
now
extant
he
speaks
so
mildly
yet
firmly
and
impartially
about
politics
uncle
tells
me
that
belgium
is
quite
a
pattern
for
its
organisation
its
industry
and
prosperity
the
finances
are
in
the
greatest
perfection
uncle
is
so
beloved
and
revered
by
his
belgian
subjects
that
it
must
be
a
great
compensation
for
all
his
extreme
trouble
but
her
other
uncle
by
no
means
shared
her
sentiments
he
could
not
he
said
put
up
with
a
and
king
leopold
would
touch
no
wine
what
that
you
drinking
sir
he
asked
him
one
day
at
dinner
water
sir
god
damn
it
sir
was
the
rejoinder
why
do
you
drink
wine
i
never
allow
anybody
to
drink
water
at
my
table
it
was
clear
that
before
very
long
there
would
be
a
great
explosion
and
in
the
hot
days
of
august
it
came
the
duchess
and
the
princess
had
gone
down
to
stay
at
windsor
for
the
king
birthday
party
and
the
king
himself
who
was
in
london
for
the
day
to
prorogue
parliament
paid
a
visit
at
kensington
palace
in
their
absence
there
he
found
that
the
duchess
had
just
appropriated
against
his
express
orders
a
suite
of
seventeen
apartments
for
her
own
use
he
was
extremely
angry
and
when
he
returned
to
windsor
after
greeting
the
princess
with
affection
he
publicly
rebuked
the
duchess
for
what
she
had
done
but
this
was
little
to
what
followed
on
the
next
day
was
the
birthday
banquet
there
were
a
hundred
guests
the
duchess
of
kent
sat
on
the
king
right
hand
and
the
princess
victoria
opposite
at
the
end
of
the
dinner
in
reply
to
the
toast
of
the
king
health
he
rose
and
in
a
long
loud
passionate
speech
poured
out
the
vials
of
his
wrath
upon
the
duchess
she
had
he
declared
insulted
him
grossly
and
continually
she
had
kept
the
princess
away
from
him
in
the
most
improper
manner
she
was
surrounded
by
evil
advisers
and
was
incompetent
to
act
with
propriety
in
the
high
station
which
she
filled
but
he
would
bear
it
no
longer
he
would
have
her
to
know
he
was
king
he
was
determined
that
his
authority
should
be
respected
henceforward
the
princess
should
attend
at
every
court
function
with
the
utmost
regularity
and
he
hoped
to
god
that
his
life
might
be
spared
for
six
months
longer
so
that
the
calamity
of
a
regency
might
be
avoided
and
the
functions
of
the
crown
pass
directly
to
the
instead
of
into
the
hands
of
the
person
now
near
him
upon
whose
conduct
and
capacity
no
reliance
whatever
could
be
placed
the
flood
of
vituperation
rushed
on
for
what
seemed
an
interminable
period
while
the
queen
blushed
scarlet
the
princess
burst
into
tears
and
the
hundred
guests
sat
aghast
the
duchess
said
not
a
word
until
the
tirade
was
over
and
the
company
had
retired
then
in
a
tornado
of
rage
and
mortification
she
called
for
her
carriage
and
announced
her
immediate
return
to
kensington
it
was
only
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
some
show
of
a
reconciliation
was
patched
up
and
the
outraged
lady
was
prevailed
upon
to
put
off
her
departure
till
the
morrow
her
troubles
however
were
not
over
when
she
had
shaken
the
dust
of
windsor
from
her
feet
in
her
own
household
she
was
pursued
by
bitterness
and
vexation
of
spirit
the
apartments
at
kensington
were
seething
with
subdued
disaffection
with
jealousies
and
animosities
virulently
intensified
by
long
years
of
propinquity
and
spite
there
was
a
deadly
feud
between
sir
john
conroy
and
baroness
lehzen
but
that
was
not
all
the
duchess
had
grown
too
fond
of
her
there
were
familiarities
and
one
day
the
princess
victoria
discovered
the
fact
she
confided
what
she
had
seen
to
the
baroness
and
to
the
baroness
beloved
ally
madame
de
spath
unfortunately
madame
de
spath
could
not
hold
her
tongue
and
was
actually
foolish
enough
to
reprove
the
duchess
whereupon
she
was
instantly
dismissed
it
was
not
so
easy
to
get
rid
of
the
baroness
that
lady
prudent
and
reserved
maintained
an
irreproachable
demeanour
her
position
was
strongly
entrenched
she
had
managed
to
secure
the
support
of
the
king
and
sir
john
found
that
he
could
do
nothing
against
her
but
henceforward
the
household
was
divided
into
two
camps
the
duchess
supported
sir
john
with
all
the
abundance
of
her
authority
but
the
baroness
too
had
an
adherent
who
could
not
be
neglected
the
princess
victoria
said
nothing
but
she
had
been
much
attached
to
madame
de
spath
and
she
adored
her
lehzen
the
duchess
knew
only
too
well
that
in
this
horrid
embroilment
her
daughter
was
against
her
chagrin
annoyance
moral
reprobation
tossed
her
to
and
fro
she
did
her
best
to
console
herself
with
sir
affectionate
loquacity
or
with
the
sharp
remarks
of
lady
flora
hastings
one
of
her
maids
of
honour
who
had
no
love
for
the
baroness
the
subject
lent
itself
to
satire
for
the
pastor
daughter
with
all
her
airs
of
stiff
superiority
had
habits
which
betrayed
her
origin
her
passion
for
caraway
seeds
for
instance
was
uncontrollable
little
bags
of
them
came
over
to
her
from
hanover
and
she
sprinkled
them
on
her
bread
and
butter
her
cabbage
and
even
her
roast
beef
lady
flora
could
not
resist
a
caustic
observation
it
was
repeated
to
the
baroness
who
pursed
her
lips
in
fury
and
so
the
mischief
grew
greville
iv
and
august
unpublished
the
cause
of
the
queen
alienation
from
the
duchess
and
hatred
of
conroy
the
duke
of
wellington
said
was
unquestionably
owing
to
her
having
witnessed
some
familiarities
between
them
what
she
had
seen
she
repeated
to
baroness
spaeth
and
spaeth
not
only
did
not
hold
her
tongue
but
he
thinks
remonstrated
with
the
duchess
herself
on
the
subject
the
consequence
was
that
they
got
rid
of
spaeth
and
they
would
have
got
rid
of
lehzen
too
if
they
had
been
able
but
lehzen
who
knew
very
well
what
was
going
on
was
prudent
enough
not
to
commit
herself
and
who
was
besides
powerfully
protected
by
george
iv
and
william
iv
so
that
they
did
not
dare
to
attempt
to
expel
her
v
the
king
had
prayed
that
he
might
live
till
his
niece
was
of
age
and
a
few
days
before
her
eighteenth
birthday
the
date
of
her
legal
majority
a
sudden
attack
of
illness
very
nearly
carried
him
off
he
recovered
however
and
the
princess
was
able
to
go
through
her
birthday
festivities
a
state
ball
and
a
with
unperturbed
enjoyment
count
zichy
she
noted
in
her
diary
is
very
in
uniform
but
not
in
plain
clothes
count
waldstein
looks
remarkably
well
in
his
pretty
hungarian
uniform
with
the
latter
young
gentleman
she
wished
to
dance
but
there
was
an
insurmountable
difficulty
he
could
not
dance
quadrilles
and
as
in
my
station
i
unfortunately
can
not
valse
and
gallop
i
could
not
dance
with
him
her
birthday
present
from
the
king
was
of
a
pleasing
nature
but
it
led
to
a
painful
domestic
scene
in
spite
of
the
anger
of
her
belgian
uncle
she
had
remained
upon
good
terms
with
her
english
one
he
had
always
been
very
kind
to
her
and
the
fact
that
he
had
quarrelled
with
her
mother
did
not
appear
to
be
a
reason
for
disliking
him
he
was
she
said
odd
very
odd
and
singular
but
his
intentions
were
often
ill
interpreted
he
now
wrote
her
a
letter
offering
her
an
allowance
of
a
year
which
he
proposed
should
be
at
her
own
disposal
and
independent
of
her
mother
lord
conyngham
the
lord
chamberlain
was
instructed
to
deliver
the
letter
into
the
princess
own
hands
when
he
arrived
at
kensington
he
was
ushered
into
the
presence
of
the
duchess
and
the
princess
and
when
he
produced
the
letter
the
duchess
put
out
her
hand
to
take
it
lord
conyngham
begged
her
royal
highness
pardon
and
repeated
the
commands
thereupon
the
duchess
drew
back
and
the
princess
took
the
letter
she
immediately
wrote
to
her
uncle
accepting
his
kind
proposal
the
duchess
was
much
displeased
a
year
she
said
would
be
quite
enough
for
victoria
as
for
the
remaining
it
would
be
only
proper
that
she
should
have
that
herself
king
william
had
thrown
off
his
illness
and
returned
to
his
normal
life
once
more
the
royal
circle
at
windsor
their
majesties
the
elder
princesses
and
some
unfortunate
ambassadress
or
minister
wife
might
be
seen
ranged
for
hours
round
a
mahogany
table
while
the
queen
netted
a
purse
and
the
king
slept
occasionally
waking
from
his
slumbers
to
observe
exactly
so
exactly
so
but
this
recovery
was
of
short
duration
the
old
man
suddenly
collapsed
with
no
specific
symptoms
besides
an
extreme
weakness
he
yet
showed
no
power
of
rallying
and
it
was
clear
to
everyone
that
his
death
was
now
close
at
hand
all
eyes
all
thoughts
turned
towards
the
princess
victoria
but
she
still
remained
shut
away
in
the
seclusion
of
kensington
a
small
unknown
figure
lost
in
the
large
shadow
of
her
mother
domination
the
preceding
year
had
in
fact
been
an
important
one
in
her
development
the
soft
tendrils
of
her
mind
had
for
the
first
time
begun
to
stretch
out
towards
unchildish
things
in
this
king
leopold
encouraged
her
after
his
return
to
brussels
he
had
resumed
his
correspondance
in
a
more
serious
strain
he
discussed
the
details
of
foreign
politics
he
laid
down
the
duties
of
kingship
he
pointed
out
the
iniquitous
foolishness
of
the
newspaper
press
on
the
latter
subject
indeed
he
wrote
with
some
asperity
if
all
the
editors
he
said
of
the
papers
in
the
countries
where
the
liberty
of
the
press
exists
were
to
be
assembled
we
should
have
a
crew
to
which
you
would
not
confide
a
dog
that
you
would
value
still
less
your
honour
and
reputation
on
the
functions
of
a
monarch
his
views
were
unexceptionable
the
business
of
the
highest
in
a
state
he
wrote
is
certainly
in
my
opinion
to
act
with
great
impartiality
and
a
spirit
of
justice
for
the
good
of
all
at
the
same
time
the
princess
tastes
were
opening
out
though
she
was
still
passionately
devoted
to
riding
and
dancing
she
now
began
to
have
a
genuine
love
of
music
as
well
and
to
drink
in
the
roulades
and
arias
of
the
italian
opera
with
high
enthusiasm
she
even
enjoyed
reading
poetry
at
any
rate
the
poetry
of
sir
walter
scott
when
king
leopold
learnt
that
king
william
death
was
approaching
he
wrote
several
long
letters
of
excellent
advice
to
his
niece
in
every
letter
i
shall
write
to
you
he
said
i
mean
to
repeat
to
you
as
a
fundamental
rule
to
be
firm
and
courageous
and
honest
as
you
have
been
till
now
for
the
rest
in
the
crisis
that
was
approaching
she
was
not
to
be
alarmed
but
to
trust
in
her
good
natural
sense
and
the
truth
of
her
character
she
was
to
do
nothing
in
a
hurry
to
hurt
no
one
and
to
continue
her
confidence
in
the
whig
administration
not
content
with
letters
however
king
leopold
determined
that
the
princess
should
not
lack
personal
guidance
and
sent
over
to
her
aid
the
trusted
friend
whom
twenty
years
before
he
had
taken
to
his
heart
by
the
at
claremont
thus
once
again
as
if
in
accordance
with
some
preordained
destiny
the
figure
of
stockmar
is
discernible
inevitably
present
at
a
momentous
hour
on
june
the
king
was
visibly
sinking
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
was
by
his
side
with
all
the
comforts
of
the
church
nor
did
the
holy
words
fall
upon
a
rebellious
spirit
for
many
years
his
majesty
had
been
a
devout
believer
when
i
was
a
young
man
he
once
explained
at
a
public
banquet
as
well
as
i
can
remember
i
believed
in
nothing
but
pleasure
and
folly
nothing
at
all
but
when
i
went
to
sea
got
into
a
gale
and
saw
the
wonders
of
the
mighty
deep
then
i
believed
and
i
have
been
a
sincere
christian
ever
since
it
was
the
anniversary
of
the
battle
of
waterloo
and
the
dying
man
remembered
it
he
should
be
glad
to
live
he
said
over
that
day
he
would
never
see
another
sunset
i
hope
your
majesty
may
live
to
see
many
said
dr
chambers
oh
quite
another
thing
that
quite
another
thing
was
the
answer
one
other
sunset
he
did
live
to
see
and
he
died
in
the
early
hours
of
the
following
morning
it
was
on
june
when
all
was
over
the
archbishop
and
the
lord
chamberlain
ordered
a
carriage
and
drove
from
windsor
to
kensington
they
arrived
at
the
palace
at
five
and
it
was
only
with
considerable
difficulty
that
they
gained
admittance
at
six
the
duchess
woke
up
her
daughter
and
told
her
that
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
lord
conyngham
were
there
and
wished
to
see
her
she
got
out
of
bed
put
on
her
and
went
alone
into
the
room
where
the
messengers
were
standing
lord
conyngham
fell
on
his
knees
and
officially
announced
the
death
of
the
king
the
archbishop
added
some
personal
details
looking
at
the
bending
murmuring
dignitaries
before
her
she
knew
that
she
was
queen
of
england
since
it
has
pleased
providence
she
wrote
that
day
in
her
journal
to
place
me
in
this
station
i
shall
do
my
utmost
to
fulfil
my
duty
towards
my
country
i
am
very
young
and
perhaps
in
many
though
not
in
all
things
inexperienced
but
i
am
sure
that
very
few
have
more
real
good
will
and
more
real
desire
to
do
what
is
fit
and
right
than
i
have
but
there
was
scant
time
for
resolutions
and
reflections
at
once
affairs
were
thick
upon
her
stockmar
came
to
breakfast
and
gave
some
good
advice
she
wrote
a
letter
to
her
uncle
leopold
and
a
hurried
note
to
her
sister
feodora
a
letter
came
from
the
prime
minister
lord
melbourne
announcing
his
approaching
arrival
he
came
at
nine
in
full
court
dress
and
kissed
her
hand
she
saw
him
alone
and
repeated
to
him
the
lesson
which
no
doubt
the
faithful
stockmar
had
taught
her
at
breakfast
it
has
long
been
my
intention
to
retain
your
lordship
and
the
rest
of
the
present
ministry
at
the
head
of
affairs
whereupon
lord
melbourne
again
kissed
her
hand
and
shortly
after
left
her
she
then
wrote
a
letter
of
condolence
to
queen
adelaide
at
eleven
lord
melbourne
came
again
and
at
eleven
she
went
downstairs
into
the
red
saloon
to
hold
her
first
council
the
great
assembly
of
lords
and
notables
bishops
generals
and
ministers
of
state
saw
the
doors
thrown
open
and
a
very
short
very
slim
girl
in
deep
plain
mourning
come
into
the
room
alone
and
move
forward
to
her
seat
with
extraordinary
dignity
and
grace
they
saw
a
countenance
not
beautiful
but
prepossessing
fair
hair
blue
prominent
eyes
a
small
curved
nose
an
open
mouth
revealing
the
upper
teeth
a
tiny
chin
a
clear
complexion
and
over
all
the
strangely
mingled
signs
of
innocence
of
gravity
of
youth
and
of
composure
they
heard
a
high
unwavering
voice
reading
aloud
with
perfect
clarity
and
then
the
ceremony
was
over
they
saw
the
small
figure
rise
and
with
the
same
consummate
grace
the
same
amazing
dignity
pass
out
from
among
them
as
she
had
come
in
alone
chapter
iii
lord
melbourne
i
the
new
queen
was
almost
entirely
unknown
to
her
subjects
in
her
public
appearances
her
mother
had
invariably
dominated
the
scene
her
private
life
had
been
that
of
a
novice
in
a
convent
hardly
a
human
being
from
the
outside
world
had
ever
spoken
to
her
and
no
human
being
at
all
except
her
mother
and
the
baroness
lehzen
had
ever
been
alone
with
her
in
a
room
thus
it
was
not
only
the
public
at
large
that
was
in
ignorance
of
everything
concerning
her
the
inner
circles
of
statesmen
and
officials
and
ladies
were
equally
in
the
dark
when
she
suddenly
emerged
from
this
deep
obscurity
the
impression
that
she
created
was
immediate
and
profound
her
bearing
at
her
first
council
filled
the
whole
gathering
with
astonishment
and
admiration
the
duke
of
wellington
sir
robert
peel
even
the
savage
croker
even
the
cold
and
caustic
greville
all
were
completely
carried
away
everything
that
was
reported
of
her
subsequent
proceedings
seemed
to
be
of
no
less
happy
augury
her
perceptions
were
quick
her
decisions
were
sensible
her
language
was
discreet
she
performed
her
royal
duties
with
extraordinary
facility
among
the
outside
public
there
was
a
great
wave
of
enthusiasm
sentiment
and
romance
were
coming
into
fashion
and
the
spectacle
of
the
little
innocent
modest
with
fair
hair
and
pink
cheeks
driving
through
her
capital
filled
the
hearts
of
the
beholders
with
raptures
of
affectionate
loyalty
what
above
all
struck
everybody
with
overwhelming
force
was
the
contrast
between
queen
victoria
and
her
uncles
the
nasty
old
men
debauched
and
selfish
and
ridiculous
with
their
perpetual
burden
of
debts
confusions
and
disreputabilities
they
had
vanished
like
the
snows
of
winter
and
here
at
last
crowned
and
radiant
was
the
spring
lord
john
russell
in
an
elaborate
oration
gave
voice
to
the
general
sentiment
he
hoped
that
victoria
might
prove
an
elizabeth
without
her
tyranny
an
anne
without
her
weakness
he
asked
england
to
pray
that
the
illustrious
princess
who
had
just
ascended
the
throne
with
the
purest
intentions
and
the
justest
desires
might
see
slavery
abolished
crime
diminished
and
education
improved
he
trusted
that
her
people
would
henceforward
derive
their
strength
their
conduct
and
their
loyalty
from
enlightened
religious
and
moral
principles
and
that
so
fortified
the
reign
of
victoria
might
prove
celebrated
to
posterity
and
to
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
very
soon
however
there
were
signs
that
the
future
might
turn
out
to
be
not
quite
so
simple
and
roseate
as
a
delighted
public
dreamed
the
illustrious
princess
might
perhaps
after
all
have
something
within
her
which
squared
ill
with
the
easy
vision
of
a
heroine
in
an
edifying
the
purest
intentions
and
the
justest
desires
no
doubt
but
was
that
all
to
those
who
watched
closely
for
instance
there
might
be
something
ominous
in
the
curious
contour
of
that
little
mouth
when
after
her
first
council
she
crossed
the
and
found
her
mother
waiting
for
her
she
said
and
now
mamma
am
i
really
and
truly
queen
you
see
my
dear
that
it
is
so
then
dear
mamma
i
hope
you
will
grant
me
the
first
request
i
make
to
you
as
queen
let
me
be
by
myself
for
an
hour
for
an
hour
she
remained
in
solitude
then
she
reappeared
and
gave
a
significant
order
her
bed
was
to
be
moved
out
of
her
mother
room
it
was
the
doom
of
the
duchess
of
kent
the
long
years
of
waiting
were
over
at
last
the
moment
of
a
lifetime
had
come
her
daughter
was
queen
of
england
and
that
very
moment
brought
her
own
annihilation
she
found
herself
absolutely
and
irretrievably
shut
off
from
every
vestige
of
influence
of
confidence
of
power
she
was
surrounded
indeed
by
all
the
outward
signs
of
respect
and
consideration
but
that
only
made
the
inward
truth
of
her
position
the
more
intolerable
through
the
mingled
formalities
of
court
etiquette
and
filial
duty
she
could
never
penetrate
to
victoria
she
was
unable
to
conceal
her
disappointment
and
her
rage
il
a
plus
pour
moi
she
exclaimed
to
madame
de
lieven
je
ne
suis
plus
rien
for
eighteen
years
she
said
this
child
had
been
the
sole
object
of
her
existence
of
her
thoughts
her
hopes
and
now
no
she
would
not
be
comforted
she
had
lost
everything
she
was
to
the
last
degree
unhappy
sailing
so
gallantly
and
so
pertinaciously
through
the
buffeting
storms
of
life
the
stately
vessel
with
sails
still
swelling
and
pennons
flying
had
put
into
harbour
at
last
to
find
there
nothing
a
land
of
bleak
desolation
within
a
month
of
the
accession
the
realities
of
the
new
situation
assumed
a
visible
shape
the
whole
royal
household
moved
from
kensington
to
buckingham
palace
and
in
the
new
abode
the
duchess
of
kent
was
given
a
suite
of
apartments
entirely
separate
from
the
queen
by
victoria
herself
the
change
was
welcomed
though
at
the
moment
of
departure
she
could
afford
to
be
sentimental
though
i
rejoice
to
go
into
for
many
reasons
she
wrote
in
her
diary
it
is
not
without
feelings
of
regret
that
i
shall
bid
adieu
for
ever
to
this
my
birthplace
where
i
have
been
born
and
bred
and
to
which
i
am
really
attached
her
memory
lingered
for
a
moment
over
visions
of
the
past
her
sister
wedding
pleasant
balls
and
delicious
concerts
and
there
were
other
recollections
i
have
gone
through
painful
and
disagreeable
scenes
here
is
true
she
concluded
but
still
i
am
fond
of
the
poor
old
palace
at
the
same
time
she
took
another
decided
step
she
had
determined
that
she
would
see
no
more
of
sir
john
conroy
she
rewarded
his
past
services
with
liberality
he
was
given
a
baronetcy
and
a
pension
of
a
year
he
remained
a
member
of
the
duchess
household
but
his
personal
intercourse
with
the
queen
came
to
an
abrupt
conclusion
ii
it
was
clear
that
these
interior
changes
whatever
else
they
might
betoken
marked
the
triumph
of
one
person
the
baroness
lehzen
the
pastor
daughter
observed
the
ruin
of
her
enemies
discreet
and
victorious
she
remained
in
possession
of
the
field
more
closely
than
ever
did
she
cleave
to
the
side
of
her
mistress
her
pupil
and
her
friend
and
in
the
recesses
of
the
palace
her
mysterious
figure
was
at
once
invisible
and
omnipresent
when
the
queen
ministers
came
in
at
one
door
the
baroness
went
out
by
another
when
they
retired
she
immediately
returned
nobody
knew
nobody
ever
will
know
the
precise
extent
and
the
precise
nature
of
her
influence
she
herself
declared
that
she
never
discussed
public
affairs
with
the
queen
that
she
was
concerned
with
private
matters
only
with
private
letters
and
the
details
of
private
life
certainly
her
hand
is
everywhere
discernible
in
victoria
early
correspondence
the
journal
is
written
in
the
style
of
a
child
the
letters
are
not
so
simple
they
are
the
work
of
a
child
rearranged
with
the
minimum
of
alteration
no
doubt
and
yet
perceptibly
by
a
governess
and
the
governess
was
no
fool
narrow
jealous
provincial
she
might
be
but
she
was
an
acute
and
vigorous
woman
who
had
gained
by
a
peculiar
insight
a
peculiar
ascendancy
that
ascendancy
she
meant
to
keep
no
doubt
it
was
true
that
technically
she
took
no
part
in
public
business
but
the
distinction
between
what
is
public
and
what
is
private
is
always
a
subtle
one
and
in
the
case
of
a
reigning
sovereign
as
the
next
few
years
were
to
show
it
is
often
imaginary
considering
all
things
the
characters
of
the
persons
and
the
character
of
the
times
it
was
something
more
than
a
mere
matter
of
private
interest
that
the
bedroom
of
baroness
lehzen
at
buckingham
palace
should
have
been
next
door
to
the
bedroom
of
the
queen
but
the
influence
wielded
by
the
baroness
supreme
as
it
seemed
within
its
own
sphere
was
not
unlimited
there
were
other
forces
at
work
for
one
thing
the
faithful
stockmar
had
taken
up
his
residence
in
the
palace
during
the
twenty
years
which
had
elapsed
since
the
death
of
the
princess
charlotte
his
experiences
had
been
varied
and
remarkable
the
unknown
counsellor
of
a
disappointed
princeling
had
gradually
risen
to
a
position
of
european
importance
his
devotion
to
his
master
had
been
not
only
whole
hearted
but
cautious
and
wise
it
was
stockmar
advice
that
had
kept
prince
leopold
in
england
during
the
critical
years
which
followed
his
wife
death
and
had
thus
secured
to
him
the
essential
requisite
of
a
point
in
the
country
of
his
adoption
it
was
stockmar
discretion
which
had
smoothed
over
the
embarrassments
surrounding
the
prince
acceptance
and
rejection
of
the
greek
crown
it
was
stockmar
who
had
induced
the
prince
to
become
the
constitutional
sovereign
of
belgium
above
all
it
was
stockmar
tact
honesty
and
diplomatic
skill
which
through
a
long
series
of
arduous
and
complicated
negotiations
had
led
to
the
guarantee
of
belgian
neutrality
by
the
great
powers
his
labours
had
been
rewarded
by
a
german
barony
and
by
the
complete
confidence
of
king
leopold
nor
was
it
only
in
brussels
that
he
was
treated
with
respect
and
listened
to
with
attention
the
statesmen
who
governed
england
lord
grey
sir
robert
peel
lord
palmerston
lord
melbourne
had
learnt
to
put
a
high
value
upon
his
probity
and
his
intelligence
he
is
one
of
the
cleverest
fellows
i
ever
saw
said
lord
melbourne
the
most
discreet
man
the
most
and
most
cool
man
and
lord
palmerston
cited
baron
stockmar
as
the
only
absolutely
disinterested
man
he
had
come
across
in
life
at
last
he
was
able
to
retire
to
coburg
and
to
enjoy
for
a
few
years
the
society
of
the
wife
and
children
whom
his
labours
in
the
service
of
his
master
had
hitherto
only
allowed
him
to
visit
at
long
intervals
for
a
month
or
two
at
a
time
but
in
he
had
been
again
entrusted
with
an
important
negotiation
which
he
had
brought
to
a
successful
conclusion
in
the
marriage
of
prince
ferdinand
of
a
nephew
of
king
leopold
with
queen
maria
ii
of
portugal
the
house
of
coburg
was
beginning
to
spread
over
europe
and
the
establishment
of
the
baron
at
buckingham
palace
in
was
to
be
the
prelude
of
another
and
a
more
momentous
advance
king
leopold
and
his
counsellor
provide
in
their
careers
an
example
of
the
curious
diversity
of
human
ambitions
the
desires
of
man
are
wonderfully
various
but
no
less
various
are
the
means
by
which
those
desires
may
reach
satisfaction
and
so
the
work
of
the
world
gets
done
the
correct
mind
of
leopold
craved
for
the
whole
apparatus
of
royalty
mere
power
would
have
held
no
attractions
for
him
he
must
be
an
actual
king
the
crowned
head
of
a
people
it
was
not
enough
to
do
it
was
essential
also
to
be
recognised
anything
else
would
not
be
fitting
the
greatness
that
he
dreamt
of
was
surrounded
by
every
appropriate
circumstance
to
be
a
majesty
to
be
a
cousin
of
sovereigns
to
marry
a
bourbon
for
diplomatic
ends
to
correspond
with
the
queen
of
england
to
be
very
stiff
and
very
punctual
to
found
a
dynasty
to
bore
ambassadresses
into
fits
to
live
on
the
highest
pinnacle
an
exemplary
life
devoted
to
the
public
service
such
were
his
objects
and
such
in
fact
were
his
achievements
the
marquis
as
george
iv
called
him
had
what
he
wanted
but
this
would
never
have
been
the
case
if
it
had
not
happened
that
the
ambition
of
stockmar
took
a
form
exactly
complementary
to
his
own
the
sovereignty
that
the
baron
sought
for
was
by
no
means
obvious
the
satisfaction
of
his
essential
being
lay
in
obscurity
in
invisibility
in
passing
unobserved
through
a
hidden
entrance
into
the
very
central
chamber
of
power
and
in
sitting
there
quietly
pulling
the
subtle
strings
that
set
the
wheels
of
the
whole
world
in
motion
a
very
few
people
in
very
high
places
and
exceptionally
knew
that
baron
stockmar
was
a
most
important
person
that
was
enough
the
fortunes
of
the
master
and
the
servant
intimately
interacting
rose
together
the
baron
secret
skill
had
given
leopold
his
unexceptionable
kingdom
and
leopold
in
his
turn
as
time
went
on
was
able
to
furnish
the
baron
with
more
and
more
keys
to
more
and
more
back
doors
stockmar
took
up
his
abode
in
the
palace
partly
as
the
emissary
of
king
leopold
but
more
particularly
as
the
friend
and
adviser
of
a
queen
who
was
almost
a
child
and
who
no
doubt
would
be
much
in
need
of
advice
and
friendship
for
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
either
of
these
two
men
was
actuated
by
a
vulgar
selfishness
the
king
indeed
was
very
well
aware
on
which
side
his
bread
was
buttered
during
an
adventurous
and
chequered
life
he
had
acquired
a
shrewd
knowledge
of
the
world
workings
and
he
was
ready
enough
to
use
that
knowledge
to
strengthen
his
position
and
to
spread
his
influence
but
then
the
firmer
his
position
and
the
wider
his
influence
the
better
for
europe
of
that
he
was
quite
certain
and
besides
he
was
a
constitutional
monarch
and
it
would
be
highly
indecorous
in
a
constitutional
monarch
to
have
any
aims
that
were
low
or
personal
as
for
stockmar
the
disinterestedness
which
palmerston
had
noted
was
undoubtedly
a
basic
element
in
his
character
the
ordinary
schemer
is
always
an
optimist
and
stockmar
racked
by
dyspepsia
and
haunted
by
gloomy
forebodings
was
a
constitutionally
melancholy
man
a
schemer
no
doubt
he
was
but
he
schemed
distrustfully
splenetically
to
do
good
to
do
good
what
nobler
end
could
a
man
scheme
for
yet
it
is
perilous
to
scheme
at
all
with
lehzen
to
supervise
every
detail
of
her
conduct
with
stockmar
in
the
next
room
so
full
of
wisdom
and
experience
of
affairs
with
her
uncle
leopold
letters
too
pouring
out
so
constantly
their
stream
of
encouragements
general
reflections
and
highly
valuable
tips
victoria
even
had
she
been
without
other
guidance
would
have
stood
in
no
lack
of
private
counsellor
but
other
guidance
she
had
for
all
these
influences
paled
before
a
new
star
of
the
first
magnitude
which
rising
suddenly
upon
her
horizon
immediately
dominated
her
life

william
lamb
viscount
melbourne
was
years
of
age
and
had
been
for
the
last
three
years
prime
minister
of
england
in
every
outward
respect
he
was
one
of
the
most
fortunate
of
mankind
he
had
been
born
into
the
midst
of
riches
brilliance
and
power
his
mother
fascinating
and
intelligent
had
been
a
great
whig
hostess
and
he
had
been
bred
up
as
a
member
of
that
radiant
society
which
during
the
last
quarter
of
the
eighteenth
century
concentrated
within
itself
the
ultimate
perfections
of
a
hundred
years
of
triumphant
aristocracy
nature
had
given
him
beauty
and
brains
the
unexpected
death
of
an
elder
brother
brought
him
wealth
a
peerage
and
the
possibility
of
high
advancement
within
that
charmed
circle
whatever
one
personal
disabilities
it
was
difficult
to
fail
and
to
him
with
all
his
advantages
success
was
unavoidable
with
little
effort
he
attained
political
eminence
on
the
triumph
of
the
whigs
he
became
one
of
the
leading
members
of
the
government
and
when
lord
grey
retired
from
the
premiership
he
quietly
stepped
into
the
vacant
place
nor
was
it
only
in
the
visible
signs
of
fortune
that
fate
had
been
kind
to
him
bound
to
succeed
and
to
succeed
easily
he
was
gifted
with
so
fine
a
nature
that
his
success
became
him
his
mind
at
once
supple
and
copious
his
temperament
at
once
calm
and
sensitive
enabled
him
not
merely
to
work
but
to
live
with
perfect
facility
and
with
the
grace
of
strength
in
society
he
was
a
notable
talker
a
captivating
companion
a
charming
man
if
one
looked
deeper
one
saw
at
once
that
he
was
not
ordinary
that
the
piquancies
of
his
conversation
and
his
manner
his
vaguenesses
his
abrupt
questions
his
lollings
and
loungings
his
innumerable
oaths
were
something
more
than
an
amusing
ornament
were
the
outward
manifestation
of
an
individuality
that
was
fundamental
the
precise
nature
of
this
individuality
was
very
difficult
to
gauge
it
was
dubious
complex
perhaps
self
contradictory
certainly
there
was
an
ironical
discordance
between
the
inner
history
of
the
man
and
his
apparent
fortunes
he
owed
all
he
had
to
his
birth
and
his
birth
was
shameful
it
was
known
well
enough
that
his
mother
had
passionately
loved
lord
egremont
and
that
lord
melbourne
was
not
his
father
his
marriage
which
had
seemed
to
be
the
crown
of
his
youthful
ardours
was
a
long
miserable
desperate
failure
the
incredible
lady
caroline
with
pleasures
too
refined
to
please
with
too
much
spirit
to
be
at
ease
with
too
much
quickness
to
be
ever
taught
with
too
much
thinking
to
have
common
thought
was
very
nearly
the
destruction
of
his
life
when
at
last
he
emerged
from
the
anguish
and
confusion
of
her
folly
her
extravagance
her
rage
her
despair
and
her
devotion
he
was
left
alone
with
endless
memories
of
intermingled
farce
and
tragedy
and
an
only
son
who
was
an
imbecile
but
there
was
something
else
that
he
owed
to
lady
caroline
while
she
whirled
with
byron
in
a
hectic
frenzy
of
love
and
fashion
he
had
stayed
at
home
in
an
indulgence
bordering
on
cynicism
and
occupied
his
solitude
with
reading
it
was
thus
that
he
had
acquired
those
habits
of
study
that
love
of
learning
and
that
wide
and
accurate
knowledge
of
ancient
and
modern
literature
which
formed
so
unexpected
a
part
of
his
mental
equipment
his
passion
for
reading
never
deserted
him
even
when
he
was
prime
minister
he
found
time
to
master
every
new
important
book
with
an
incongruousness
that
was
characteristic
his
favourite
study
was
theology
an
accomplished
classical
scholar
he
was
deeply
read
in
the
fathers
of
the
church
heavy
volumes
of
commentary
and
exegesis
he
examined
with
scrupulous
diligence
and
at
any
odd
moment
he
might
be
found
turning
over
the
pages
of
the
bible
to
the
ladies
whom
he
most
liked
he
would
lend
some
learned
work
on
the
revelation
crammed
with
marginal
notes
in
his
own
hand
or
lardner
observations
upon
the
jewish
errors
with
respect
to
the
conversion
of
mary
magdalene
the
more
pious
among
them
had
high
hopes
that
these
studies
would
lead
him
into
the
right
way
but
of
this
there
were
no
symptoms
in
his
conversations
the
paradox
of
his
political
career
was
no
less
curious
by
temperament
an
aristocrat
by
conviction
a
conservative
he
came
to
power
as
the
leader
of
the
popular
party
the
party
of
change
he
had
profoundly
disliked
the
reform
bill
which
he
had
only
accepted
at
last
as
a
necessary
evil
and
the
reform
bill
lay
at
the
root
of
the
very
existence
of
the
very
meaning
of
his
government
he
was
far
too
sceptical
to
believe
in
progress
of
any
kind
things
were
best
as
they
were
or
rather
they
were
least
bad
you
better
try
to
do
no
good
was
one
of
his
dictums
and
then
you
get
into
no
scrapes
education
at
best
was
futile
education
of
the
poor
was
positively
dangerous
the
factory
children
oh
if
you
only
have
the
goodness
to
leave
them
alone
free
trade
was
a
delusion
the
ballot
was
nonsense
and
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
democracy
nevertheless
he
was
not
a
reactionary
he
was
simply
an
opportunist
the
whole
duty
of
government
he
said
was
to
prevent
crime
and
to
preserve
contracts
all
one
could
really
hope
to
do
was
to
carry
on
he
himself
carried
on
in
a
remarkable
manner
with
perpetual
compromises
with
fluctuations
and
contradictions
with
every
kind
of
weakness
and
yet
with
shrewdness
with
gentleness
even
with
conscientiousness
and
a
light
and
airy
mastery
of
men
and
of
events
he
conducted
the
transactions
of
business
with
extraordinary
nonchalance
important
persons
ushered
up
for
some
grave
interview
found
him
in
a
towselled
bed
littered
with
books
and
papers
or
vaguely
shaving
in
a
but
when
they
went
downstairs
again
they
would
realise
that
somehow
or
other
they
had
been
pumped
when
he
had
to
receive
a
deputation
he
could
hardly
ever
do
so
with
becoming
gravity
the
worthy
delegates
of
the
or
the
society
for
the
abolition
of
capital
punishment
were
distressed
and
mortified
when
in
the
midst
of
their
speeches
the
prime
minister
became
absorbed
in
blowing
a
feather
or
suddenly
cracked
an
unseemly
joke
how
could
they
have
guessed
that
he
had
spent
the
night
before
diligently
getting
up
the
details
of
their
case
he
hated
patronage
and
the
making
of
appointments
a
feeling
rare
in
ministers
as
for
the
bishops
he
burst
out
i
positively
believe
they
die
to
vex
me
but
when
at
last
the
appointment
was
made
it
was
made
with
keen
discrimination
his
colleagues
observed
another
symptom
was
it
of
his
irresponsibility
or
his
wisdom
he
went
to
sleep
in
the
cabinet
probably
if
he
had
been
born
a
little
earlier
he
would
have
been
a
simpler
and
a
happier
man
as
it
was
he
was
a
child
of
the
eighteenth
century
whose
lot
was
cast
in
a
new
difficult
unsympathetic
age
he
was
an
autumn
rose
with
all
his
gracious
amenity
his
humour
his
ways
a
deep
disquietude
possessed
him
a
sentimental
cynic
a
sceptical
believer
he
was
restless
and
melancholy
at
heart
above
all
he
could
never
harden
himself
those
sensitive
petals
shivered
in
every
wind
whatever
else
he
might
be
one
thing
was
certain
lord
melbourne
was
always
human
supremely
human
too
human
perhaps
and
now
with
old
age
upon
him
his
life
took
a
sudden
new
extraordinary
turn
he
became
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
intimate
adviser
and
the
daily
companion
of
a
young
girl
who
had
stepped
all
at
once
from
a
nursery
to
a
throne
his
relations
with
women
had
been
like
everything
else
about
him
ambiguous
nobody
had
ever
been
able
quite
to
gauge
the
shifting
emotional
complexities
of
his
married
life
lady
caroline
vanished
but
his
peculiar
susceptibilities
remained
female
society
of
some
kind
or
other
was
necessary
to
him
and
he
did
not
stint
himself
a
great
part
of
every
day
was
invariably
spent
in
it
the
feminine
element
in
him
made
it
easy
made
it
natural
and
inevitable
for
him
to
be
the
friend
of
a
great
many
women
but
the
masculine
element
in
him
was
strong
as
well
in
such
circumstances
it
is
also
easy
it
is
even
natural
perhaps
it
is
even
inevitable
to
be
something
more
than
a
friend
there
were
rumours
and
combustions
lord
melbourne
was
twice
a
in
a
divorce
action
but
on
each
occasion
he
won
his
suit
the
lovely
lady
brandon
the
unhappy
and
brilliant
norton
the
law
exonerated
them
both
beyond
that
hung
an
impenetrable
veil
but
at
any
rate
it
was
clear
that
with
such
a
record
the
prime
position
in
buckingham
palace
must
be
a
highly
delicate
one
however
he
was
used
to
delicacies
and
he
met
the
situation
with
consummate
success
his
behaviour
was
from
the
first
moment
impeccable
his
manner
towards
the
young
queen
mingled
with
perfect
facility
the
watchfulness
and
the
respect
of
a
statesman
and
a
courtier
with
the
tender
solicitude
of
a
parent
he
was
at
once
reverential
and
affectionate
at
once
the
servant
and
the
guide
at
the
same
time
the
habits
of
his
life
underwent
a
surprising
change
his
comfortable
unpunctual
days
became
subject
to
the
unaltering
routine
of
a
palace
no
longer
did
he
sprawl
on
sofas
not
a
single
damn
escaped
his
lips
the
man
of
the
world
who
had
been
the
friend
of
byron
and
the
regent
the
talker
whose
paradoxes
had
held
holland
house
enthralled
the
cynic
whose
ribaldries
had
enlivened
so
many
deep
potations
the
lover
whose
soft
words
had
captivated
such
beauty
and
such
passion
and
such
wit
might
now
be
seen
evening
after
evening
talking
with
infinite
politeness
to
a
schoolgirl
bolt
upright
amid
the
silence
and
the
rigidity
of
court
etiquette
iv
on
her
side
victoria
was
instantaneously
fascinated
by
lord
melbourne
the
good
report
of
stockmar
had
no
doubt
prepared
the
way
lehzen
was
wisely
propitiated
and
the
first
highly
favourable
impression
was
never
afterwards
belied
she
found
him
perfect
and
perfect
in
her
sight
he
remained
her
absolute
and
unconcealed
adoration
was
very
natural
what
innocent
young
creature
could
have
resisted
in
any
circumstances
the
charm
and
the
devotion
of
such
a
man
but
in
her
situation
there
was
a
special
influence
which
gave
a
peculiar
glow
to
all
she
felt
after
years
of
emptiness
and
dullness
and
suppression
she
had
come
suddenly
in
the
heyday
of
youth
into
freedom
and
power
she
was
mistress
of
herself
of
great
domains
and
palaces
she
was
queen
of
england
responsibilities
and
difficulties
she
might
have
no
doubt
and
in
heavy
measure
but
one
feeling
dominated
and
absorbed
all
others
the
feeling
of
joy
everything
pleased
her
she
was
in
high
spirits
from
morning
till
night
creevey
grown
old
now
and
very
near
his
end
catching
a
glimpse
of
her
at
brighton
was
much
amused
in
his
sharp
fashion
by
the
ingenuous
gaiety
of
little
vic
a
more
homely
little
being
you
never
beheld
when
she
is
at
her
ease
and
she
is
evidently
dying
to
be
always
more
so
she
laughs
in
real
earnest
opening
her
mouth
as
wide
as
it
can
go
showing
not
very
pretty
gums
she
eats
quite
as
heartily
as
she
laughs
i
think
i
may
say
she
gobbles
she
blushes
and
laughs
every
instant
in
so
natural
a
way
as
to
disarm
anybody
but
it
was
not
merely
when
she
was
laughing
or
gobbling
that
she
enjoyed
herself
the
performance
of
her
official
duties
gave
her
intense
satisfaction
i
really
have
immensely
to
do
she
wrote
in
her
journal
a
few
days
after
her
accession
i
receive
so
many
communications
from
my
ministers
but
i
like
it
very
much
and
again
a
week
later
i
repeat
what
i
said
before
that
i
have
so
many
communications
from
the
ministers
and
from
me
to
them
and
i
get
so
many
papers
to
sign
every
day
that
i
have
always
a
very
great
deal
to
do
i
delight
in
this
work
through
the
girl
immaturity
the
vigorous
predestined
tastes
of
the
woman
were
pushing
themselves
into
existence
with
eager
velocity
with
delicious
force
one
detail
of
her
happy
situation
deserves
particular
mention
apart
from
the
splendour
of
her
social
position
and
the
momentousness
of
her
political
one
she
was
a
person
of
great
wealth
as
soon
as
parliament
met
an
annuity
of
was
settled
upon
her
when
the
expenses
of
her
household
had
been
discharged
she
was
left
with
a
year
of
her
own
she
enjoyed
besides
the
revenues
of
the
duchy
of
lancaster
which
amounted
annually
to
over
the
first
use
to
which
she
put
her
money
was
characteristic
she
paid
off
her
father
debts
in
money
matters
no
less
than
in
other
matters
she
was
determined
to
be
correct
she
had
the
instincts
of
a
man
of
business
and
she
never
could
have
borne
to
be
in
a
position
that
was
financially
unsound
with
youth
and
happiness
gilding
every
hour
the
days
passed
merrily
enough
and
each
day
hinged
upon
lord
melbourne
her
diary
shows
us
with
undiminished
clarity
the
life
of
the
young
sovereign
during
the
early
months
of
her
reign
a
life
satisfactorily
regular
full
of
delightful
business
a
life
of
simple
pleasures
mostly
physical
riding
eating
dancing
a
quick
easy
highly
unsophisticated
life
sufficient
unto
itself
the
light
of
the
morning
is
upon
it
and
in
the
rosy
radiance
the
figure
of
lord
emerges
glorified
and
supreme
if
she
is
the
heroine
of
the
story
he
is
the
hero
but
indeed
they
are
more
than
hero
and
heroine
for
there
are
no
other
characters
at
all
lehzen
the
baron
uncle
leopold
are
unsubstantial
shadows
the
incidental
supers
of
the
piece
her
paradise
was
peopled
by
two
persons
and
surely
that
was
enough
one
sees
them
together
still
a
curious
couple
strangely
united
in
those
artless
pages
under
the
magical
illumination
of
that
dawn
of
eighty
years
ago
the
polished
high
fine
gentleman
with
the
whitening
hair
and
whiskers
and
the
thick
dark
eyebrows
and
the
mobile
lips
and
the
big
expressive
eyes
and
beside
him
the
tiny
queen
fair
slim
elegant
active
in
her
plain
girl
dress
and
little
tippet
looking
up
at
him
earnestly
adoringly
with
eyes
blue
and
projecting
and
mouth
so
they
appear
upon
every
page
of
the
journal
upon
every
page
lord
is
present
lord
is
speaking
lord
is
being
amusing
instructive
delightful
and
affectionate
at
once
while
victoria
drinks
in
the
honied
words
laughs
till
she
shows
her
gums
tries
hard
to
remember
and
runs
off
as
soon
as
she
is
left
alone
to
put
it
all
down
their
long
conversations
touched
upon
a
multitude
of
topics
lord
would
criticise
books
throw
out
a
remark
or
two
on
the
british
constitution
make
some
passing
reflections
on
human
life
and
tell
story
after
story
of
the
great
people
of
the
eighteenth
century
then
there
would
be
business
a
despatch
perhaps
from
lord
durham
in
canada
which
lord
would
read
but
first
he
must
explain
a
little
he
said
that
i
must
know
that
canada
originally
belonged
to
the
french
and
was
only
ceded
to
the
english
in
when
it
was
taken
in
an
expedition
under
wolfe
very
daring
enterprise
he
said
canada
was
then
entirely
french
and
the
british
only
came
afterwards
lord
explained
this
very
clearly
and
much
better
than
i
have
done
and
said
a
good
deal
more
about
it
he
then
read
me
durham
despatch
which
is
a
very
long
one
and
took
him
more
than
an
hour
to
read
lord
read
it
beautifully
with
that
fine
soft
voice
of
his
and
with
so
much
expression
so
that
it
is
needless
to
say
i
was
much
interested
by
it
and
then
the
talk
would
take
a
more
personal
turn
lord
would
describe
his
boyhood
and
she
would
learn
that
he
wore
his
hair
long
as
all
boys
then
did
till
he
was
how
handsome
he
must
have
looked
or
she
would
find
out
about
his
queer
tastes
and
habits
how
he
never
carried
a
watch
which
seemed
quite
extraordinary
always
ask
the
servant
what
it
is
and
then
he
tells
me
what
he
likes
said
lord
or
as
the
rooks
wheeled
about
round
the
trees
in
a
manner
which
indicated
rain
he
would
say
that
he
could
sit
looking
at
them
for
an
hour
and
was
quite
surprised
at
my
disliking
them
said
rooks
are
my
delight
the
day
routine
whether
in
london
or
at
windsor
was
almost
invariable
the
morning
was
devoted
to
business
and
lord
in
the
afternoon
the
whole
court
went
out
riding
the
queen
in
her
velvet
riding
habit
and
a
with
a
veil
draped
about
the
brim
headed
the
cavalcade
and
lord
rode
beside
her
the
lively
troupe
went
fast
and
far
to
the
extreme
exhilaration
of
her
majesty
back
in
the
palace
again
there
was
still
time
for
a
little
more
fun
before
dinner
a
game
of
battledore
and
shuttlecock
perhaps
or
a
romp
along
the
galleries
with
some
children
dinner
came
and
the
ceremonial
decidedly
tightened
the
gentleman
of
highest
rank
sat
on
the
right
hand
of
the
queen
on
her
left
it
soon
became
an
established
rule
sat
lord
melbourne
after
the
ladies
had
left
the
the
gentlemen
were
not
permitted
to
remain
behind
for
very
long
indeed
the
short
time
allowed
them
for
their
formed
the
subject
so
it
was
rumoured
of
one
of
the
very
few
disputes
between
the
queen
and
her
prime
minister
but
her
determination
carried
the
day
and
from
that
moment
drunkenness
began
to
go
out
of
fashion
when
the
company
was
reassembled
in
the
the
etiquette
was
stiff
for
a
few
moments
the
queen
spoke
in
turn
to
each
one
of
her
guests
and
during
these
short
uneasy
colloquies
the
aridity
of
royalty
was
apt
to
become
painfully
evident
one
night
greville
the
clerk
of
the
privy
council
was
present
his
turn
soon
came
the
viveur
was
addressed
by
his
young
hostess
have
you
been
riding
mr
greville
asked
the
queen
no
madam
i
have
not
replied
greville
it
was
a
fine
day
continued
the
queen
yes
madam
a
very
fine
day
said
greville
it
was
rather
cold
though
said
the
queen
it
was
rather
cold
madam
said
greville
your
sister
lady
frances
egerton
rides
i
think
does
she
said
the
queen
she
does
ride
sometimes
madam
said
greville
there
was
a
pause
after
which
greville
ventured
to
take
the
lead
though
he
did
not
venture
to
change
the
subject
has
your
majesty
been
riding
today
asked
greville
oh
yes
a
very
long
ride
answered
the
queen
with
animation
has
your
majesty
got
a
nice
horse
said
greville
oh
a
very
nice
horse
said
the
queen
it
was
over
her
majesty
gave
a
smile
and
an
inclination
of
the
head
greville
a
profound
bow
and
the
next
conversation
began
with
the
next
gentleman
when
all
the
guests
had
been
disposed
of
the
duchess
of
kent
sat
down
to
her
whist
while
everybody
else
was
ranged
about
the
round
table
lord
melbourne
sat
beside
the
queen
and
talked
pertinaciously
very
often
a
propos
to
the
contents
of
one
of
the
large
albums
of
engravings
with
which
the
round
table
was
covered
until
it
was
eleven
and
time
to
go
to
bed
the
duke
of
bedford
told
greville
he
was
sure
there
was
a
battle
between
her
and
melbourne
he
is
sure
there
was
one
about
the
men
sitting
after
dinner
for
he
heard
her
say
to
him
rather
angrily
is
a
horrid
but
when
the
ladies
left
the
room
he
dined
there
directions
were
given
that
the
men
should
remain
five
minutes
longer
greville
memoirs
february
unpublished
occasionally
there
were
little
diversions
the
evening
might
be
spent
at
the
opera
or
at
the
play
next
morning
the
royal
critic
was
careful
to
note
down
her
impressions
it
was
shakespeare
tragedy
of
hamlet
and
we
came
in
at
the
beginning
of
it
charles
kean
son
of
old
kean
acted
the
part
of
hamlet
and
i
must
say
beautifully
his
conception
of
this
very
difficult
and
i
may
almost
say
incomprehensible
character
is
admirable
his
delivery
of
all
the
fine
long
speeches
quite
beautiful
he
is
excessively
graceful
and
all
his
actions
and
attitudes
are
good
though
not
at
all
in
face
i
came
away
just
as
hamlet
was
over
later
on
she
went
to
see
macready
in
king
lear
the
story
was
new
to
her
she
knew
nothing
about
it
and
at
first
she
took
very
little
interest
in
what
was
passing
on
the
stage
she
preferred
to
chatter
and
laugh
with
the
lord
chamberlain
but
as
the
play
went
on
her
mood
changed
her
attention
was
fixed
and
then
she
laughed
no
more
yet
she
was
puzzled
it
seemed
a
strange
a
horrible
business
what
did
lord
think
lord
thought
it
was
a
very
fine
play
but
to
be
sure
a
rough
coarse
play
written
for
those
times
with
exaggerated
characters
i
glad
you
seen
it
he
added
but
undoubtedly
the
evenings
which
she
enjoyed
most
were
those
on
which
there
was
dancing
she
was
always
ready
enough
to
seize
any
excuse
the
arrival
of
cousins
a
birthday
a
gathering
of
young
people
to
give
the
command
for
that
then
when
the
band
played
and
the
figures
of
the
dancers
swayed
to
the
music
and
she
felt
her
own
figure
swaying
too
with
youthful
spirits
so
close
on
every
side
then
her
happiness
reached
its
height
her
eyes
sparkled
she
must
go
on
and
on
into
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
for
a
moment
lord
himself
was
forgotten
v
the
months
flew
past
the
summer
was
over
the
pleasantest
summer
i
ever
passed
in
my
life
and
i
shall
never
forget
this
first
summer
of
my
reign
with
surprising
rapidity
another
summer
was
upon
her
the
coronation
came
and
went
a
curious
dream
the
antique
intricate
endless
ceremonial
worked
itself
out
as
best
it
could
like
some
machine
of
gigantic
complexity
which
was
a
little
out
of
order
the
small
central
figure
went
through
her
gyrations
she
sat
she
walked
she
prayed
she
carried
about
an
orb
that
was
almost
too
heavy
to
hold
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
came
and
crushed
a
ring
upon
the
wrong
finger
so
that
she
was
ready
to
cry
out
with
the
pain
old
lord
rolle
tripped
up
in
his
mantle
and
fell
down
the
steps
as
he
was
doing
homage
she
was
taken
into
a
side
chapel
where
the
altar
was
covered
with
a
sandwiches
and
bottles
of
wine
she
perceived
lehzen
in
an
upper
box
and
exchanged
a
smile
with
her
as
she
sat
robed
and
crowned
on
the
confessor
throne
i
shall
ever
remember
this
day
as
the
proudest
of
my
life
she
noted
but
the
pride
was
soon
merged
once
more
in
youth
and
simplicity
when
she
returned
to
buckingham
palace
at
last
she
was
not
tired
she
ran
up
to
her
private
rooms
doffed
her
splendours
and
gave
her
dog
dash
its
evening
bath
life
flowed
on
again
with
its
accustomed
smoothness
though
of
course
the
smoothness
was
occasionally
disturbed
for
one
thing
there
was
the
distressing
behaviour
of
uncle
leopold
the
king
of
the
belgians
had
not
been
able
to
resist
attempting
to
make
use
of
his
family
position
to
further
his
diplomatic
ends
but
indeed
why
should
there
be
any
question
of
resisting
was
not
such
a
course
of
conduct
far
from
being
a
temptation
simply
selon
les
regles
what
were
royal
marriages
for
if
they
did
not
enable
sovereigns
in
spite
of
the
hindrances
of
constitutions
to
control
foreign
politics
for
the
highest
purposes
of
course
that
was
understood
the
queen
of
england
was
his
niece
more
than
that
almost
his
daughter
his
confidential
agent
was
living
in
a
position
of
intimate
favour
at
her
court
surely
in
such
circumstances
it
would
be
preposterous
it
would
be
positively
incorrect
to
lose
the
opportunity
of
bending
to
his
wishes
by
means
of
personal
influence
behind
the
backs
of
the
english
ministers
the
foreign
policy
of
england
he
set
about
the
task
with
becoming
precautions
he
continued
in
his
letters
his
admirable
advice
within
a
few
days
of
her
accession
he
recommended
the
young
queen
to
lay
emphasis
on
every
possible
occasion
upon
her
english
birth
to
praise
the
english
nation
the
established
church
i
also
recommend
strongly
you
can
not
without
pledging
yourself
to
anything
particular
say
too
much
on
the
subject
and
then
before
you
decide
on
anything
important
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
consult
me
this
would
also
have
the
advantage
of
giving
you
time
nothing
was
more
injurious
than
to
be
hurried
into
wrong
decisions
unawares
his
niece
replied
at
once
with
all
the
accustomed
warmth
of
her
affection
but
she
wrote
hurriedly
and
perhaps
a
trifle
vaguely
too
your
advice
is
always
of
the
greatest
importance
to
me
she
said
had
he
possibly
gone
too
far
he
could
not
be
certain
perhaps
victoria
had
been
hurried
in
any
case
he
would
be
careful
he
would
draw
back
pour
mieux
sauter
he
added
to
himself
with
a
smile
in
his
next
letters
he
made
no
reference
to
his
suggestion
of
consultations
with
himself
he
merely
pointed
out
the
wisdom
in
general
of
refusing
to
decide
upon
important
questions
so
far
his
advice
was
taken
and
it
was
noticed
that
the
queen
when
applications
were
made
to
her
rarely
gave
an
immediate
answer
even
with
lord
melbourne
it
was
the
same
when
he
asked
for
her
opinion
upon
any
subject
she
would
reply
that
she
would
think
it
over
and
tell
him
her
conclusions
next
day
king
leopold
counsels
continued
the
princess
de
lieven
he
said
was
a
dangerous
woman
there
was
reason
to
think
that
she
would
make
attempts
to
pry
into
what
did
not
concern
her
let
victoria
beware
a
rule
which
i
can
not
sufficiently
recommend
is
never
to
permit
people
to
speak
on
subjects
concerning
yourself
or
your
affairs
without
you
having
yourself
desired
them
to
do
so
should
such
a
thing
occur
change
the
conversation
and
make
the
individual
feel
that
he
has
made
a
mistake
this
piece
of
advice
was
also
taken
for
it
fell
out
as
the
king
had
predicted
madame
de
lieven
sought
an
audience
and
appeared
to
be
verging
towards
confidential
topics
whereupon
the
queen
becoming
slightly
embarrassed
talked
of
nothing
but
commonplaces
the
individual
felt
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
the
king
next
warning
was
remarkable
letters
he
pointed
out
are
almost
invariably
read
in
the
post
this
was
inconvenient
no
doubt
but
the
fact
once
properly
grasped
was
not
without
its
advantages
i
will
give
you
an
example
we
are
still
plagued
by
prussia
concerning
those
fortresses
now
to
tell
the
prussian
government
many
things
which
we
should
not
like
to
tell
them
officially
the
minister
is
going
to
write
a
despatch
to
our
man
at
berlin
sending
it
by
post
the
prussians
are
sure
to
read
it
and
to
learn
in
this
way
what
we
wish
them
to
hear
analogous
circumstances
might
very
probably
occur
in
england
i
tell
you
the
trick
wrote
his
majesty
that
you
should
be
able
to
guard
against
it
such
were
the
subtleties
of
constitutional
sovereignty
it
seemed
that
the
time
had
come
for
another
step
the
king
next
letter
was
full
of
foreign
politics
the
situation
in
spain
and
portugal
the
character
of
louis
philippe
and
he
received
a
favourable
answer
victoria
it
is
true
began
by
saying
that
she
had
shown
the
political
part
of
his
letter
to
lord
melbourne
but
she
proceeded
to
a
discussion
of
foreign
affairs
it
appeared
that
she
was
not
unwilling
to
exchange
observations
on
such
matters
with
her
uncle
so
far
so
good
but
king
leopold
was
still
cautious
though
a
crisis
was
impending
in
his
diplomacy
he
still
hung
back
at
last
however
he
could
keep
silence
no
longer
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
to
him
that
in
his
manoeuvrings
with
france
and
holland
he
should
have
or
at
any
rate
appear
to
have
english
support
but
the
english
government
appeared
to
adopt
a
neutral
attitude
it
was
too
bad
not
to
be
for
him
was
to
be
against
him
could
they
not
see
that
yet
perhaps
they
were
only
wavering
and
a
little
pressure
upon
them
from
victoria
might
still
save
all
he
determined
to
put
the
case
before
her
delicately
yet
forcibly
just
as
he
saw
it
himself
all
i
want
from
your
kind
majesty
he
wrote
is
that
you
will
occasionally
express
to
your
ministers
and
particularly
to
good
lord
melbourne
that
as
far
as
it
is
compatible
with
the
interests
of
your
own
dominions
you
do
not
wish
that
your
government
should
take
the
lead
in
such
measures
as
might
in
a
short
time
bring
on
the
destruction
of
this
country
as
well
as
that
of
your
uncle
and
his
family
the
result
of
this
appeal
was
unexpected
there
was
dead
silence
for
more
than
a
week
when
victoria
at
last
wrote
she
was
prodigal
of
her
affection
it
would
indeed
my
dearest
uncle
be
very
wrong
of
you
if
you
thought
my
feelings
of
warm
and
devoted
attachment
to
you
and
of
great
affection
for
you
could
be
changed
nothing
can
ever
change
them
but
her
references
to
foreign
politics
though
they
were
lengthy
and
elaborate
were
in
the
extreme
they
were
almost
cast
in
an
official
and
diplomatic
form
her
ministers
she
said
entirely
shared
her
views
upon
the
subject
she
understood
and
sympathised
with
the
difficulties
of
her
beloved
position
and
he
might
rest
assured
that
both
lord
melbourne
and
lord
palmerston
are
most
anxious
at
all
times
for
the
prosperity
and
welfare
of
belgium
that
was
all
the
king
in
his
reply
declared
himself
delighted
and
the
affectionate
protestations
of
his
niece
my
dearest
and
most
beloved
victoria
he
said
you
have
written
me
a
very
dear
and
long
letter
which
has
given
me
great
pleasure
and
satisfaction
he
would
not
admit
that
he
had
had
a
rebuff
a
few
months
later
the
crisis
came
king
leopold
determined
to
make
a
bold
push
and
to
carry
victoria
with
him
this
time
by
a
display
of
royal
vigour
and
avuncular
authority
in
an
abrupt
an
almost
peremptory
letter
he
laid
his
case
once
more
before
his
niece
you
know
from
experience
he
wrote
that
i
never
ask
anything
of
you
but
as
i
said
before
if
we
are
not
careful
we
may
see
serious
consequences
which
may
affect
more
or
less
everybody
and
this
ought
to
be
the
object
of
our
most
anxious
attention
i
remain
my
dear
victoria
your
affectionate
uncle
leopold
the
queen
immediately
despatched
this
letter
to
lord
melbourne
who
replied
with
a
carefully
form
of
words
signifying
nothing
whatever
which
he
suggested
she
should
send
to
her
uncle
she
did
so
copying
out
the
elaborate
formula
with
a
liberal
scattering
of
dear
uncles
interspersed
and
she
concluded
her
letter
with
a
message
of
affectionate
love
to
aunt
louise
and
the
children
then
at
last
king
leopold
was
obliged
to
recognise
the
facts
his
next
letter
contained
no
reference
at
all
to
politics
i
am
glad
he
wrote
to
find
that
you
like
brighton
better
than
last
year
i
think
brighton
very
agreeable
at
this
time
of
the
year
till
the
east
winds
set
in
the
pavilion
besides
is
comfortable
that
can
not
be
denied
before
my
marriage
it
was
there
that
i
met
the
regent
charlotte
afterwards
came
with
old
queen
charlotte
how
distant
all
this
already
but
still
how
present
to
one
memory
like
poor
madame
de
lieven
his
majesty
felt
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
nevertheless
he
could
not
quite
give
up
all
hope
another
opportunity
offered
and
he
made
another
effort
but
there
was
not
very
much
conviction
in
it
and
it
was
immediately
crushed
my
dear
uncle
the
queen
wrote
i
have
to
thank
you
for
your
last
letter
which
i
received
on
sunday
though
you
seem
not
to
dislike
my
political
sparks
i
think
it
is
better
not
to
increase
them
as
they
might
finally
take
fire
particularly
as
i
see
with
regret
that
upon
this
one
subject
we
can
not
agree
i
shall
therefore
limit
myself
to
my
expressions
of
very
sincere
wishes
for
the
welfare
and
prosperity
of
belgium
after
that
it
was
clear
that
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
henceforward
there
is
audible
in
the
king
letters
a
curiously
elegiac
note
my
dearest
victoria
your
delightful
little
letter
has
just
arrived
and
went
like
an
arrow
to
my
heart
yes
my
beloved
victoria
i
do
love
you
tenderly
i
love
you
for
yourself
and
i
love
in
you
the
dear
child
whose
welfare
i
tenderly
watched
he
had
gone
through
much
yet
if
life
had
its
disappointments
it
had
its
satisfactions
too
i
have
all
the
honours
that
can
be
given
and
i
am
politically
speaking
very
solidly
established
but
there
were
other
things
besides
politics
there
were
romantic
yearnings
in
his
heart
the
only
longing
i
still
have
is
for
the
orient
where
i
perhaps
shall
once
end
my
life
rising
in
the
west
and
setting
in
the
east
as
for
his
devotion
to
his
niece
that
could
never
end
i
never
press
my
services
on
you
nor
my
councils
though
i
may
say
with
some
truth
that
from
the
extraordinary
fate
which
the
higher
powers
had
ordained
for
me
my
experience
both
political
and
of
private
life
is
great
i
am
always
ready
to
be
useful
to
you
when
and
where
and
it
may
be
and
i
repeat
it
all
i
want
in
return
is
some
little
sincere
affection
from
you
vi
the
correspondence
with
king
leopold
was
significant
of
much
that
still
lay
partly
hidden
in
the
character
of
victoria
her
attitude
towards
her
uncle
had
never
wavered
for
a
moment
to
all
his
advances
she
had
presented
an
absolutely
unyielding
front
the
foreign
policy
of
england
was
not
his
province
it
was
hers
and
her
ministers
his
insinuations
his
entreaties
his
struggles
all
were
quite
useless
and
he
must
understand
that
this
was
so
the
rigidity
of
her
position
was
the
more
striking
owing
to
the
respectfulness
and
the
affection
with
which
it
was
accompanied
from
start
to
finish
the
unmoved
queen
remained
the
devoted
niece
leopold
himself
must
have
envied
such
perfect
correctitude
but
what
may
be
admirable
in
an
elderly
statesman
is
alarming
in
a
maiden
of
nineteen
and
privileged
observers
were
not
without
their
fears
the
strange
mixture
of
ingenuous
and
fixed
determination
of
frankness
and
reticence
of
childishness
and
pride
seemed
to
augur
a
future
that
was
perplexed
and
full
of
dangers
as
time
passed
the
less
pleasant
qualities
in
this
curious
composition
revealed
themselves
more
often
and
more
seriously
there
were
signs
of
an
imperious
a
peremptory
temper
an
egotism
that
was
strong
and
hard
it
was
noticed
that
the
palace
etiquette
far
from
relaxing
grew
ever
more
and
more
inflexible
by
some
this
was
attributed
to
lehzen
influence
but
if
that
was
so
lehzen
had
a
willing
pupil
for
the
slightest
infringements
of
the
freezing
rules
of
regularity
and
deference
were
invariably
and
immediately
visited
by
the
sharp
and
haughty
glances
of
the
queen
yet
her
majesty
eyes
crushing
as
they
could
be
were
less
crushing
than
her
mouth
the
depicted
in
those
small
projecting
teeth
and
that
small
receding
chin
was
of
a
more
dismaying
kind
than
that
which
a
powerful
jaw
betokens
it
was
a
self
will
imperturbable
impenetrable
unintelligent
a
dangerously
akin
to
obstinacy
and
the
obstinacy
of
monarchs
is
not
as
that
of
other
men
within
two
years
of
her
accession
the
which
from
the
first
had
been
dimly
visible
on
the
horizon
gathered
and
burst
victoria
relations
with
her
mother
had
not
improved
the
duchess
of
kent
still
surrounded
by
all
the
galling
appearances
of
filial
consideration
remained
in
buckingham
palace
a
discarded
figure
powerless
and
inconsolable
sir
john
conroy
banished
from
the
presence
of
the
queen
still
presided
over
the
duchess
household
and
the
hostilities
of
kensington
continued
unabated
in
the
new
surroundings
lady
flora
hastings
still
cracked
her
malicious
jokes
the
animosity
of
the
baroness
was
still
unappeased
one
day
lady
flora
found
the
joke
was
turned
against
her
early
in
travelling
in
the
suite
of
the
duchess
she
had
returned
from
scotland
in
the
same
carriage
with
sir
john
a
change
in
her
figure
became
the
subject
of
an
unseemly
jest
tongues
wagged
and
the
jest
grew
serious
it
was
whispered
that
lady
flora
was
with
child
the
state
of
her
health
seemed
to
confirm
the
suspicion
she
consulted
sir
james
clark
the
royal
physician
and
after
the
consultation
sir
james
let
his
tongue
wag
too
on
this
the
scandal
flared
up
everyone
was
talking
the
baroness
was
not
surprised
the
duchess
rallied
tumultuously
to
the
support
of
her
lady
the
queen
was
informed
at
last
the
extraordinary
expedient
of
a
medical
examination
was
resorted
to
during
which
sir
james
according
to
lady
flora
behaved
with
brutal
rudeness
while
a
second
doctor
was
extremely
polite
finally
both
physicians
signed
a
certificate
entirely
exculpating
the
lady
but
this
was
by
no
means
the
end
of
the
business
the
hastings
family
socially
a
very
powerful
one
threw
itself
into
the
fray
with
all
the
fury
of
outraged
pride
and
injured
innocence
lord
hastings
insisted
upon
an
audience
of
the
queen
wrote
to
the
papers
and
demanded
the
dismissal
of
sir
james
clark
the
queen
expressed
her
regret
to
lady
flora
but
sir
james
clark
was
not
dismissed
the
tide
of
opinion
turned
violently
against
the
queen
and
her
advisers
high
society
was
disgusted
by
all
this
washing
of
dirty
linen
in
buckingham
palace
the
public
at
large
was
indignant
at
the
of
lady
flora
by
the
end
of
march
the
popularity
so
radiant
and
so
abundant
with
which
the
young
sovereign
had
begun
her
reign
had
entirely
disappeared
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
a
great
lack
of
discretion
had
been
shown
by
the
court
which
should
have
been
instantly
nipped
in
the
bud
had
been
allowed
to
assume
disgraceful
proportions
and
the
throne
itself
had
become
involved
in
the
personal
malignities
of
the
palace
a
particularly
awkward
question
had
been
raised
by
the
position
of
sir
james
clark
the
duke
of
wellington
upon
whom
it
was
customary
to
fall
back
in
cases
of
great
difficulty
in
high
places
had
been
consulted
upon
this
question
and
he
had
given
it
as
his
opinion
that
as
it
would
be
impossible
to
remove
sir
james
without
a
public
enquiry
sir
james
must
certainly
stay
where
he
was
probably
the
duke
was
right
but
the
fact
that
the
peccant
doctor
continued
in
the
queen
service
made
the
hastings
family
irreconcilable
and
produced
an
unpleasant
impression
of
unrepentant
error
upon
the
public
mind
as
for
victoria
she
was
very
young
and
quite
inexperienced
and
she
can
hardly
be
blamed
for
having
failed
to
control
an
extremely
difficult
situation
that
was
clearly
lord
melbourne
task
he
was
a
man
of
the
world
and
with
vigilance
and
circumspection
he
might
have
quietly
put
out
the
ugly
flames
while
they
were
still
smouldering
he
did
not
do
so
he
was
lazy
and
the
baroness
was
persistent
and
he
let
things
slide
but
doubtless
his
position
was
not
an
easy
one
passions
ran
high
in
the
palace
and
victoria
was
not
only
very
young
she
was
very
headstrong
too
did
he
possess
the
magic
bridle
which
would
curb
that
fiery
steed
he
could
not
be
certain
and
then
suddenly
another
violent
crisis
revealed
more
unmistakably
than
ever
the
nature
of
the
mind
with
which
he
had
to
deal
vii
the
queen
had
for
long
been
haunted
by
a
terror
that
the
day
might
come
when
she
would
be
obliged
to
part
with
her
minister
ever
since
the
passage
of
the
reform
bill
the
power
of
the
whig
government
had
steadily
declined
the
general
election
of
had
left
them
with
a
very
small
majority
in
the
house
of
commons
since
then
they
had
been
in
constant
difflculties
abroad
at
home
in
ireland
the
radical
group
had
grown
hostile
it
became
highly
doubtful
how
much
longer
they
could
survive
the
queen
watched
the
development
of
events
in
great
anxiety
she
was
a
whig
by
birth
by
upbringing
by
every
association
public
and
private
and
even
if
those
ties
had
never
existed
the
mere
fact
that
lord
was
the
head
of
the
whigs
would
have
amply
sufficed
to
determine
her
politics
the
fall
of
the
whigs
would
mean
a
sad
upset
for
lord
but
it
would
have
a
still
more
terrible
consequence
lord
would
have
to
leave
her
and
the
daily
the
hourly
presence
of
lord
had
become
an
integral
part
of
her
life
six
months
after
her
accession
she
had
noted
in
her
diary
i
shall
be
very
sorry
to
lose
him
even
for
one
night
and
this
feeling
of
personal
dependence
on
her
minister
steadily
increased
in
these
circumstances
it
was
natural
that
she
should
have
become
a
whig
partisan
of
the
wider
significance
of
political
questions
she
knew
nothing
all
she
saw
was
that
her
friends
were
in
office
and
about
her
and
that
it
would
be
dreadful
if
they
ceased
to
be
so
i
can
not
say
she
wrote
when
a
critical
division
was
impending
though
i
feel
confident
of
our
success
how
low
how
sad
i
feel
when
i
think
of
the
possibility
of
this
excellent
and
truly
kind
man
not
remaining
my
minister
yet
i
trust
fervently
that
he
who
has
so
wonderfully
protected
me
through
such
manifold
difficulties
will
not
now
desert
me
i
should
have
liked
to
have
expressed
to
lord
my
anxiety
but
the
tears
were
nearer
than
words
throughout
the
time
i
saw
him
and
i
felt
i
should
have
choked
had
i
attempted
to
say
anything
lord
melbourne
realised
clearly
enough
how
undesirable
was
such
a
state
of
mind
in
a
constitutional
sovereign
who
might
be
called
upon
at
any
moment
to
receive
as
her
ministers
the
leaders
of
the
opposite
party
he
did
what
he
could
to
cool
her
ardour
but
in
vain
with
considerable
lack
of
foresight
too
he
had
himself
helped
to
bring
about
this
unfortunate
condition
of
affairs
from
the
moment
of
her
accession
he
had
surrounded
the
queen
with
ladies
of
his
own
party
the
mistress
of
the
robes
and
all
the
ladies
of
the
bedchamber
were
whigs
in
the
ordinary
course
the
queen
never
saw
a
tory
eventually
she
took
pains
never
to
see
one
in
any
circumstances
she
disliked
the
whole
tribe
and
she
did
not
conceal
the
fact
she
particularly
disliked
sir
robert
peel
who
would
almost
certainly
be
the
next
prime
minister
his
manners
were
detestable
and
he
wanted
to
turn
out
lord
his
supporters
without
exception
were
equally
bad
and
as
for
sir
james
graham
she
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
him
he
was
exactly
like
sir
john
conroy
the
affair
of
lady
flora
intensified
these
party
rumours
still
further
the
hastings
were
tories
and
lord
melbourne
and
the
court
were
attacked
by
the
tory
press
in
unmeasured
language
the
queen
sectarian
zeal
proportionately
increased
but
the
dreaded
hour
was
now
fast
approaching
early
in
may
the
ministers
were
visibly
tottering
on
a
vital
point
of
policy
they
could
only
secure
a
majority
of
five
in
the
house
of
commons
they
determined
to
resign
when
victoria
heard
the
news
she
burst
into
tears
was
it
possible
then
that
all
was
over
was
she
indeed
about
to
see
lord
for
the
last
time
lord
came
and
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
even
in
this
crowning
moment
of
misery
and
agitation
the
precise
girl
noted
to
the
minute
the
exact
time
of
the
arrival
and
the
departure
of
her
beloved
minister
the
conversation
was
touching
and
prolonged
but
it
could
only
end
in
one
way
the
queen
must
send
for
the
duke
of
wellington
when
next
morning
the
duke
came
he
advised
her
majesty
to
send
for
sir
robert
peel
she
was
in
a
state
of
dreadful
grief
but
she
swallowed
down
her
tears
and
braced
herself
with
royal
resolution
for
the
odious
odious
interview
peel
was
by
nature
reserved
proud
and
shy
his
manners
were
not
perfect
and
he
knew
it
he
was
easily
embarrassed
and
at
such
moments
he
grew
even
more
stiff
and
formal
than
before
while
his
feet
mechanically
performed
upon
the
carpet
a
measure
anxious
as
he
now
was
to
win
the
queen
good
graces
his
very
anxiety
to
do
so
made
the
attainment
of
his
object
the
more
difficult
he
entirely
failed
to
make
any
headway
whatever
with
the
haughty
hostile
girl
before
him
she
coldly
noted
that
he
appeared
to
be
unhappy
and
put
out
and
while
he
stood
in
painful
fixity
with
an
occasional
uneasy
pointing
of
the
toe
her
heart
sank
within
her
at
the
sight
of
that
manner
oh
how
different
how
dreadfully
different
to
the
frank
open
natural
and
most
kind
warm
manner
of
lord
melbourne
nevertheless
the
audience
passed
without
disaster
only
at
one
point
had
there
been
some
slight
hint
of
a
disagreement
peel
had
decided
that
a
change
would
be
necessary
in
the
composition
of
the
royal
household
the
queen
must
no
longer
be
entirely
surrounded
by
the
wives
and
sisters
of
his
opponents
some
at
any
rate
of
the
ladies
of
the
bedchamber
should
be
friendly
to
his
government
when
this
matter
was
touched
upon
the
queen
had
intimated
that
she
wished
her
household
to
remain
unchanged
to
which
sir
robert
had
replied
that
the
question
could
be
settled
later
and
shortly
afterwards
withdrew
to
arrange
the
details
of
his
cabinet
while
he
was
present
victoria
had
remained
as
she
herself
said
very
much
collected
civil
and
high
and
betrayed
no
agitation
but
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
she
completely
broke
down
then
she
pulled
herself
together
to
write
to
lord
melbourne
an
account
of
all
that
had
happened
and
of
her
own
wretchedness
she
feels
she
said
lord
melbourne
will
understand
it
amongst
enemies
to
those
she
most
relied
on
and
most
esteemed
but
what
is
worst
of
all
is
the
being
deprived
of
seeing
lord
melbourne
as
she
used
to
do
lord
melbourne
replied
with
a
very
wise
letter
he
attempted
to
calm
the
queen
and
to
induce
her
to
accept
the
new
position
gracefully
and
he
had
nothing
but
good
words
for
the
tory
leaders
as
for
the
question
of
the
ladies
of
the
household
the
queen
he
said
should
strongly
urge
what
she
desired
as
it
was
a
matter
which
concerned
her
personally
but
he
added
if
sir
robert
is
unable
to
concede
it
it
will
not
do
to
refuse
and
to
put
off
the
negotiation
upon
it
on
this
point
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
lord
melbourne
was
right
the
question
was
a
complicated
and
subtle
one
and
it
had
never
arisen
before
but
subsequent
constitutional
practice
has
determined
that
a
queen
regnant
must
accede
to
the
wishes
of
her
prime
minister
as
to
the
personnel
of
the
female
part
of
her
household
lord
melbourne
wisdom
however
was
wasted
the
queen
would
not
be
soothed
and
still
less
would
she
take
advice
it
was
outrageous
of
the
tories
to
want
to
deprive
her
of
her
ladies
and
that
night
she
made
up
her
mind
that
whatever
sir
robert
might
say
she
would
refuse
to
consent
to
the
removal
of
a
single
one
of
them
accordingly
when
next
morning
peel
appeared
again
she
was
ready
for
action
he
began
by
detailing
the
cabinet
appointments
and
then
he
added
now
about
the
when
the
queen
sharply
interrupted
him
i
can
not
give
up
any
of
my
ladies
she
said
what
said
sir
robert
does
your
majesty
mean
to
retain
them
all
all
said
the
queen
sir
robert
face
worked
strangely
he
could
not
conceal
his
agitation
the
mistress
of
the
robes
and
the
ladies
of
the
bedchamber
he
brought
out
at
last
all
replied
once
more
her
majesty
it
was
in
vain
that
peel
pleaded
and
argued
in
vain
that
he
spoke
growing
every
moment
more
pompous
and
uneasy
of
the
constitution
and
queens
regnant
and
the
public
interest
in
vain
that
he
danced
his
pathetic
minuet
she
was
adamant
but
he
too
through
all
his
embarrassment
showed
no
sign
of
yielding
and
when
at
last
he
left
her
nothing
had
been
decided
the
whole
formation
of
the
government
was
hanging
in
the
wind
a
frenzy
of
excitement
now
seized
upon
victoria
sir
robert
she
believed
in
her
fury
had
tried
to
outwit
her
to
take
her
friends
from
her
to
impose
his
will
upon
her
own
but
that
was
not
all
she
had
suddenly
perceived
while
the
poor
man
was
moving
so
uneasily
before
her
the
one
thing
that
she
was
desperately
longing
for
a
of
escape
she
seized
a
pen
and
dashed
off
a
note
to
lord
melbourne
sir
robert
has
behaved
very
ill
she
wrote
he
insisted
on
my
giving
up
my
ladies
to
which
i
replied
that
i
never
would
consent
and
i
never
saw
a
man
so
frightened
i
was
calm
but
very
decided
and
i
think
you
would
have
been
pleased
to
see
my
composure
and
great
firmness
the
queen
of
england
will
not
submit
to
such
trickery
keep
yourself
in
readiness
for
you
may
soon
be
wanted
hardly
had
she
finished
when
the
duke
of
wellington
was
announced
well
he
said
as
he
entered
i
am
very
sorry
to
find
there
is
a
difficulty
oh
she
instantly
replied
he
began
it
not
me
she
felt
that
only
one
thing
now
was
needed
she
must
be
firm
and
firm
she
was
the
venerable
conqueror
of
napoleon
was
outfaced
by
the
relentless
equanimity
of
a
girl
in
her
teens
he
could
not
move
the
queen
one
inch
at
last
she
even
ventured
to
rally
him
is
sir
robert
so
weak
she
asked
that
even
the
ladies
must
be
of
his
opinion
on
which
the
duke
made
a
brief
and
humble
expostulation
bowed
low
and
departed
had
she
won
time
would
show
and
in
the
meantime
she
scribbled
down
another
letter
lord
melbourne
must
not
think
the
queen
rash
in
her
conduct
the
queen
felt
this
was
an
attempt
to
see
whether
she
could
be
led
and
managed
like
a
child
the
tories
were
not
only
wicked
but
ridiculous
peel
having
as
she
understood
expressed
a
wish
to
remove
only
those
members
of
the
household
who
were
in
parliament
now
objected
to
her
ladies
i
should
like
to
know
she
exclaimed
in
triumphant
scorn
if
they
mean
to
give
the
ladies
seats
in
parliament
the
exclamation
they
wished
to
treat
me
like
a
girl
but
i
will
show
them
that
i
am
queen
of
england
often
quoted
as
the
queen
is
apocryphal
it
is
merely
part
of
greville
summary
of
the
two
letters
to
melbourne
it
may
be
noted
that
the
phrase
the
queen
of
england
will
not
submit
to
such
trickery
is
omitted
in
girlhood
and
in
general
there
are
numerous
verbal
discrepancies
between
the
versions
of
the
journal
and
the
letters
in
the
two
books
the
end
of
the
crisis
was
now
fast
approaching
sir
robert
returned
and
told
her
that
if
she
insisted
upon
retaining
all
her
ladies
he
could
not
form
a
government
she
replied
that
she
would
send
him
her
final
decision
in
writing
next
morning
the
late
whig
cabinet
met
lord
melbourne
read
to
them
the
queen
letters
and
the
group
of
elderly
politicians
were
overcome
by
an
extraordinary
wave
of
enthusiasm
they
knew
very
well
that
to
say
the
least
it
was
highly
doubtful
whether
the
queen
had
acted
in
strict
accordance
with
the
constitution
that
in
doing
what
she
had
done
she
had
brushed
aside
lord
melbourne
advice
that
in
reality
there
was
no
public
reason
whatever
why
they
should
go
back
upon
their
decision
to
resign
but
such
considerations
vanished
before
the
passionate
urgency
of
victoria
the
intensity
of
her
determination
swept
them
headlong
down
the
stream
of
her
desire
they
unanimously
felt
that
it
was
impossible
to
abandon
such
a
queen
and
such
a
woman
forgetting
that
they
were
no
longer
her
ministers
they
took
the
unprecedented
course
of
advising
the
queen
by
letter
to
put
an
end
to
her
negotiation
with
sir
robert
peel
she
did
so
all
was
over
she
had
triumphed
that
evening
there
was
a
ball
at
the
palace
everyone
was
present
peel
and
the
duke
of
wellington
came
by
looking
very
much
put
out
she
was
perfectly
happy
lord
was
prime
minister
once
more
and
he
was
by
her
side
viii
happiness
had
returned
with
lord
but
it
was
happiness
in
the
midst
of
agitation
the
domestic
imbroglio
continued
unabated
until
at
last
the
duke
rejected
as
a
minister
was
called
in
once
again
in
his
old
capacity
as
moral
physician
to
the
family
something
was
accomplished
when
at
last
he
induced
sir
john
conroy
to
resign
his
place
about
the
duchess
of
kent
and
leave
the
palace
for
ever
something
more
when
he
persuaded
the
queen
to
write
an
affectionate
letter
to
her
mother
the
way
seemed
open
for
a
reconciliation
but
the
duchess
was
stormy
still
she
did
believe
that
victoria
had
written
that
letter
it
was
not
in
her
handwriting
and
she
sent
for
the
duke
to
tell
him
so
the
duke
assuring
her
that
the
letter
was
genuine
begged
her
to
forget
the
past
but
that
was
not
so
easy
what
am
i
to
do
if
lord
melbourne
comes
up
to
me
do
why
receive
him
with
civility
well
she
would
make
an
effort
but
what
am
i
to
do
if
victoria
asks
me
to
shake
hands
with
lehzen
do
why
take
her
in
your
arms
and
kiss
her
what
the
duchess
bristled
in
every
feather
and
then
she
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
no
no
said
the
duke
laughing
too
i
mean
you
are
to
take
lehzen
in
your
arms
and
kiss
her
but
the
queen
the
duke
might
perhaps
have
succeeded
had
not
all
attempts
at
conciliation
been
rendered
hopeless
by
a
tragical
event
lady
flora
it
was
discovered
had
been
suffering
from
a
terrible
internal
malady
which
now
grew
rapidly
worse
there
could
be
little
doubt
that
she
was
dying
the
queen
unpopularity
reached
an
extraordinary
height
more
than
once
she
was
publicly
insulted
melbourne
was
shouted
at
her
when
she
appeared
at
her
balcony
and
at
ascot
she
was
hissed
by
the
duchess
of
montrose
and
lady
sarah
ingestre
as
she
passed
lady
flora
died
the
whole
scandal
burst
out
again
with
redoubled
vehemence
while
in
the
palace
the
two
parties
were
henceforth
divided
by
an
impassable
a
stygian
gulf
nevertheless
lord
was
back
and
every
trouble
faded
under
the
enchantment
of
his
presence
and
his
conversation
he
on
his
side
had
gone
through
much
and
his
distresses
were
intensified
by
a
consciousness
of
his
own
shortcomings
he
realised
clearly
enough
that
if
he
had
intervened
at
the
right
moment
the
hastings
scandal
might
have
been
averted
and
in
the
bedchamber
crisis
he
knew
that
he
had
allowed
his
judgment
to
be
overruled
and
his
conduct
to
be
swayed
by
private
feelings
and
the
impetuosity
of
victoria
but
he
was
not
one
to
suffer
too
acutely
from
the
pangs
of
conscience
in
spite
of
the
dullness
and
the
formality
of
the
court
his
relationship
with
the
queen
had
come
to
be
the
dominating
interest
in
his
life
to
have
been
deprived
of
it
would
have
been
heartrending
that
dread
eventuality
had
been
somehow
avoided
he
was
installed
once
more
in
a
kind
of
triumph
let
him
enjoy
the
fleeting
hours
to
the
full
and
so
cherished
by
the
favour
of
a
sovereign
and
warmed
by
the
adoration
of
a
girl
the
autumn
rose
in
those
autumn
months
of
came
to
a
wondrous
blooming
the
petals
expanded
beautifully
for
the
last
time
for
the
last
time
in
this
unlooked
for
this
incongruous
this
almost
incredible
intercourse
the
old
epicure
tasted
the
exquisiteness
of
romance
to
watch
to
teach
to
restrain
to
encourage
the
royal
young
creature
beside
him
that
was
much
to
feel
with
such
a
constant
intimacy
the
impact
of
her
quick
affection
her
radiant
vitality
that
was
more
most
of
all
perhaps
was
it
good
to
linger
vaguely
in
humorous
contemplation
in
idle
apostrophe
to
talk
disconnectedly
to
make
a
little
joke
about
an
apple
or
a
furbelow
to
dream
the
springs
of
his
sensibility
hidden
deep
within
him
were
overflowing
often
as
he
bent
over
her
hand
and
kissed
it
he
found
himself
in
tears
upon
victoria
with
all
her
impermeability
it
was
inevitable
that
such
a
companionship
should
have
produced
eventually
an
effect
she
was
no
longer
the
simple
schoolgirl
of
two
years
since
the
change
was
visible
even
in
her
public
demeanour
her
expression
once
ingenuous
and
serene
now
appeared
to
a
shrewd
observer
to
be
bold
and
discontented
she
had
learnt
something
of
the
pleasures
of
power
and
the
pains
of
it
but
that
was
not
all
lord
melbourne
with
his
gentle
instruction
had
sought
to
lead
her
into
the
paths
of
wisdom
and
moderation
but
the
whole
unconscious
movement
of
his
character
had
swayed
her
in
a
very
different
direction
the
hard
clear
pebble
subjected
for
so
long
and
so
constantly
to
that
encircling
and
insidious
fluidity
had
suffered
a
curious
corrosion
it
seemed
to
be
actually
growing
a
little
soft
and
a
little
clouded
humanity
and
fallibility
are
infectious
things
was
it
possible
that
lehzen
prim
pupil
had
caught
them
that
she
was
beginning
to
listen
to
siren
voices
that
the
secret
impulses
of
of
even
were
mastering
her
life
for
a
moment
the
child
of
a
new
age
looked
back
and
wavered
towards
the
eighteenth
century
it
was
the
most
critical
moment
of
her
career
had
those
influences
lasted
the
development
of
her
character
the
history
of
her
life
would
have
been
completely
changed
and
why
should
they
not
last
she
for
one
was
very
anxious
that
they
should
let
them
last
for
ever
she
was
surrounded
by
whigs
she
was
free
to
do
whatever
she
wanted
she
had
lord
she
could
not
believe
that
she
could
ever
be
happier
any
change
would
be
for
the
worse
and
the
worst
change
of
all
no
she
would
not
hear
of
it
it
would
be
quite
intolerable
it
would
upset
everything
if
she
were
to
marry
and
yet
everyone
seemed
to
want
her
to
the
general
public
the
ministers
her
relations
it
was
always
the
same
story
of
course
she
knew
very
well
that
there
were
excellent
reasons
for
it
for
one
thing
if
she
remained
childless
and
were
to
die
her
uncle
cumberland
who
was
now
the
king
of
hanover
would
succeed
to
the
throne
of
england
that
no
doubt
would
be
a
most
unpleasant
event
and
she
entirely
sympathised
with
everybody
who
wished
to
avoid
it
but
there
was
no
hurry
naturally
she
would
marry
in
the
end
but
not
just
yet
not
for
three
or
four
years
what
was
tiresome
was
that
her
uncle
leopold
had
apparently
determined
not
only
that
she
ought
to
marry
but
that
her
cousin
albert
ought
to
be
her
husband
that
was
very
like
her
uncle
leopold
who
wanted
to
have
a
finger
in
every
pie
and
it
was
true
that
long
ago
in
days
before
her
accession
even
she
had
written
to
him
in
a
way
which
might
well
have
encouraged
him
in
such
a
notion
she
had
told
him
then
that
albert
possessed
every
quality
that
could
be
desired
to
render
her
perfectly
happy
and
had
begged
her
dearest
uncle
to
take
care
of
the
health
of
one
now
so
dear
to
me
and
to
take
him
under
your
special
protection
adding
i
hope
and
trust
all
will
go
on
prosperously
and
well
on
this
subject
of
so
much
importance
to
me
but
that
had
been
years
ago
when
she
was
a
mere
child
perhaps
indeed
to
judge
from
the
language
the
letter
had
been
dictated
by
lehzen
at
any
rate
her
feelings
and
all
the
circumstances
had
now
entirely
changed
albert
hardly
interested
her
at
all
in
later
life
the
queen
declared
that
she
had
never
for
a
moment
dreamt
of
marrying
anyone
but
her
cousin
her
letters
and
diaries
tell
a
very
different
story
on
august
she
wrote
in
her
journal
is
my
dearest
cousin
albert
birthday
and
i
pray
heaven
to
pour
its
choicest
blessings
on
his
beloved
head
in
the
subsequent
years
however
the
date
passes
unnoticed
it
had
been
arranged
that
stockmar
should
accompany
the
prince
to
italy
and
the
faithful
baron
left
her
side
for
that
purpose
he
wrote
to
her
more
than
once
with
sympathetic
descriptions
of
his
young
companion
but
her
mind
was
by
this
time
made
up
she
liked
and
admired
albert
very
much
but
she
did
not
want
to
marry
him
at
present
she
told
lord
melbourne
in
april
my
feeling
is
quite
against
ever
marrying
when
her
cousin
italian
tour
came
to
an
end
she
began
to
grow
nervous
she
knew
that
according
to
a
engagement
his
next
journey
would
be
to
england
he
would
probably
arrive
in
the
autumn
and
by
july
her
uneasiness
was
intense
she
determined
to
write
to
her
uncle
in
order
to
make
her
position
clear
it
must
be
understood
she
said
that
there
is
no
no
engagement
between
us
if
she
should
like
albert
she
could
make
no
final
promise
this
year
for
at
the
very
earliest
any
such
event
could
not
take
place
till
two
or
three
years
hence
she
had
she
said
a
great
repugnance
to
change
her
present
position
and
if
she
should
not
like
him
she
was
very
anxious
that
it
should
be
understood
that
she
would
not
be
guilty
of
any
breach
of
promise
for
she
never
gave
any
to
lord
melbourne
she
was
more
explicit
she
told
him
that
she
had
no
great
wish
to
see
albert
as
the
whole
subject
was
an
odious
one
she
hated
to
have
to
decide
about
it
and
she
repeated
once
again
that
seeing
albert
would
be
a
disagreeable
thing
but
there
was
no
escaping
the
horrid
business
the
visit
must
be
made
and
she
must
see
him
the
summer
slipped
by
and
was
over
it
was
the
autumn
already
on
the
evening
of
october
albert
accompanied
by
his
brother
ernest
arrived
at
windsor
albert
arrived
and
the
whole
structure
of
her
existence
crumbled
into
nothingness
like
a
house
of
cards
he
was
beautiful
she
gasped
she
knew
no
more
then
in
a
flash
a
thousand
mysteries
were
revealed
to
her
the
past
the
present
rushed
upon
her
with
a
new
significance
the
delusions
of
years
were
abolished
and
an
extraordinary
an
irresistible
certitude
leapt
into
being
in
the
light
of
those
blue
eyes
the
smile
of
that
lovely
mouth
the
succeeding
hours
passed
in
a
rapture
she
was
able
to
observe
a
few
more
details
the
exquisite
nose
the
delicate
moustachios
and
slight
but
very
slight
whiskers
the
beautiful
figure
broad
in
the
shoulders
and
a
fine
waist
she
rode
with
him
danced
with
him
talked
with
him
and
it
was
all
perfection
she
had
no
shadow
of
a
doubt
he
had
come
on
a
thursday
evening
and
on
the
following
sunday
morning
she
told
lord
melbourne
that
she
had
a
good
deal
changed
her
opinion
as
to
marrying
next
morning
she
told
him
that
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
marry
albert
the
morning
after
that
she
sent
for
her
cousin
she
received
him
alone
and
after
a
few
minutes
i
said
to
him
that
i
thought
he
must
be
aware
why
i
wished
them
to
come
here
and
that
it
would
make
me
too
happy
if
he
would
consent
to
what
i
wished
to
marry
me
then
we
embraced
each
other
and
he
was
so
kind
so
affectionate
she
said
that
she
was
quite
unworthy
of
him
while
he
murmured
that
he
would
be
very
happy
das
leben
mit
dir
zu
zubringen
they
parted
and
she
felt
the
happiest
of
human
beings
when
lord
came
in
at
first
she
beat
about
the
bush
and
talked
of
the
weather
and
indifferent
subjects
somehow
or
other
she
felt
a
little
nervous
with
her
old
friend
at
last
summoning
up
her
courage
she
said
i
have
got
well
through
this
with
albert
oh
you
have
said
lord
chapter
iv
marriage
i
it
was
decidedly
a
family
match
prince
francis
charles
augustus
albert
emmanuel
of
gotha
for
such
was
his
full
title
had
been
born
just
three
months
after
his
cousin
victoria
and
the
same
midwife
had
assisted
at
the
two
births
the
children
grandmother
the
dowager
duchess
of
coburg
had
from
the
first
looked
forward
to
their
marriage
as
they
grew
up
the
duke
the
duchess
of
kent
and
king
leopold
came
equally
to
desire
it
the
prince
ever
since
the
time
when
as
a
child
of
three
his
nurse
had
told
him
that
some
day
the
little
english
may
flower
would
be
his
wife
had
never
thought
of
marrying
anyone
else
when
eventually
baron
stockmar
himself
signified
his
assent
the
affair
seemed
as
good
as
settled
the
duke
had
one
other
child
prince
ernest
albert
senior
by
one
year
and
heir
to
the
principality
the
duchess
was
a
sprightly
and
beautiful
woman
with
fair
hair
and
blue
eyes
albert
was
very
like
her
and
was
her
declared
favourite
but
in
his
fifth
year
he
was
parted
from
her
for
ever
the
ducal
court
was
not
noted
for
the
strictness
of
its
morals
the
duke
was
a
man
of
gallantry
and
it
was
rumoured
that
the
duchess
followed
her
husband
example
there
were
scandals
one
of
the
court
chamberlains
a
charming
and
cultivated
man
of
jewish
extraction
was
talked
of
at
last
there
was
a
separation
followed
by
a
divorce
the
duchess
retired
to
paris
and
died
unhappily
in
her
memory
was
always
very
dear
to
albert
he
grew
up
a
pretty
clever
and
boy
usually
he
was
however
sometimes
violent
he
had
a
will
of
his
own
and
asserted
it
his
elder
brother
was
less
passionate
less
purposeful
and
in
their
wrangles
it
was
albert
who
came
out
top
the
two
boys
living
for
the
most
part
in
one
or
other
of
the
duke
country
houses
among
pretty
hills
and
woods
and
streams
had
been
at
a
very
early
age
albert
was
less
than
four
separated
from
their
nurses
and
put
under
a
tutor
in
whose
charge
they
remained
until
they
went
to
the
university
they
were
brought
up
in
a
simple
and
unostentatious
manner
for
the
duke
was
poor
and
the
duchy
very
small
and
very
insignificant
before
long
it
became
evident
that
albert
was
a
model
lad
intelligent
and
painstaking
he
had
been
touched
by
the
moral
earnestness
of
his
generation
at
the
age
of
eleven
he
surprised
his
father
by
telling
him
that
he
hoped
to
make
himself
a
good
and
useful
man
and
yet
he
was
not
though
perhaps
he
had
little
humour
he
was
full
of
fun
of
practical
jokes
and
mimicry
he
was
no
milksop
he
rode
and
shot
and
fenced
above
all
did
he
delight
in
being
out
of
doors
and
never
was
he
happier
than
in
his
long
rambles
with
his
brother
through
the
wild
country
round
his
beloved
rosenau
stalking
the
deer
admiring
the
scenery
and
returning
laden
with
specimens
for
his
natural
history
collection
he
was
besides
passionately
fond
of
music
in
one
particular
it
was
observed
that
he
did
not
take
after
his
father
owing
either
to
his
peculiar
upbringing
or
to
a
more
fundamental
idiosyncrasy
he
had
a
marked
distaste
for
the
opposite
sex
at
the
age
of
five
at
a
children
dance
he
screamed
with
disgust
and
anger
when
a
little
girl
was
led
up
to
him
for
a
partner
and
though
later
on
he
grew
more
successful
in
disguising
such
feelings
the
feelings
remained
the
brothers
were
very
popular
in
coburg
and
when
the
time
came
for
them
to
be
confirmed
the
preliminary
examination
which
according
to
ancient
custom
was
held
in
public
in
the
giants
hall
of
the
castle
was
attended
by
an
enthusiastic
crowd
of
functionaries
clergy
delegates
from
the
villages
of
the
duchy
and
miscellaneous
onlookers
there
were
also
present
besides
the
duke
and
the
dowager
duchess
their
serene
highnesses
the
princes
alexander
and
ernest
of
wurtemberg
prince
leiningen
princess
and
princess
jacobi
the
court
chaplain
presided
at
an
altar
simply
but
appropriately
decorated
which
had
been
placed
at
the
end
of
the
hall
and
the
proceedings
began
by
the
choir
singing
the
first
verse
of
the
hymn
come
holy
ghost
after
some
introductory
remarks
jacobi
began
the
examination
the
dignified
and
decorous
bearing
of
the
princes
we
are
told
in
a
contemporary
account
their
strict
attention
to
the
questions
the
frankness
decision
and
correctness
of
their
answers
produced
a
deep
impression
on
the
numerous
assembly
nothing
was
more
striking
in
their
answers
than
the
evidence
they
gave
of
deep
feeling
and
of
inward
strength
of
conviction
the
questions
put
by
the
examiner
were
not
such
as
to
be
met
by
a
simple
or
they
were
carefully
considered
in
order
to
give
the
audience
a
clear
insight
into
the
views
and
feelings
of
the
young
princes
one
of
the
most
touching
moments
was
when
the
examiner
asked
the
hereditary
prince
whether
he
intended
steadfastly
to
hold
to
the
evangelical
church
and
the
prince
answered
not
only
but
added
in
a
clear
and
decided
tone
and
my
brother
are
firmly
resolved
ever
to
remain
faithful
to
the
acknowledged
truth
the
examination
having
lasted
an
hour
jacobi
made
some
concluding
observations
followed
by
a
short
prayer
the
second
and
third
verses
of
the
opening
hymn
were
sung
and
the
ceremony
was
over
the
princes
stepping
down
from
the
altar
were
embraced
by
the
duke
and
the
dowager
duchess
after
which
the
loyal
inhabitants
of
coburg
dispersed
well
satisfied
with
their
entertainment
albert
mental
development
now
proceeded
apace
in
his
seventeenth
year
he
began
a
careful
study
of
german
literature
and
german
philosophy
he
set
about
he
told
his
tutor
to
follow
the
thoughts
of
the
great
klopstock
into
their
depths
though
in
this
for
the
most
part
he
modestly
added
i
do
not
succeed
he
wrote
an
essay
on
the
mode
of
thought
of
the
germans
and
a
sketch
of
the
history
of
german
civilisation
making
use
he
said
in
its
general
outlines
of
the
divisions
which
the
treatment
of
the
subject
itself
demands
and
concluding
with
a
retrospect
of
the
shortcomings
of
our
time
with
an
appeal
to
every
one
to
correct
those
shortcomings
in
his
own
case
and
thus
set
a
good
example
to
others
placed
for
some
months
under
the
care
of
king
leopold
at
brussels
he
came
under
the
influence
of
adolphe
quetelet
a
mathematical
professor
who
was
particularly
interested
in
the
application
of
the
laws
of
probability
to
political
and
moral
phenomena
this
line
of
inquiry
attracted
the
prince
and
the
friendship
thus
begun
continued
till
the
end
of
his
life
from
brussels
he
went
to
the
university
of
bonn
where
he
was
speedily
distinguished
both
by
his
intellectual
and
his
social
activities
his
energies
were
absorbed
in
metaphysics
law
political
economy
music
fencing
and
amateur
theatricals
thirty
years
later
his
fellow
students
recalled
with
delight
the
fits
of
laughter
into
which
they
had
been
sent
by
prince
albert
mimicry
the
verve
with
which
his
serene
highness
reproduced
the
tones
and
gestures
of
one
of
the
professors
who
used
to
point
to
a
picture
of
a
row
of
houses
in
venice
with
the
remark
that
is
the
and
of
another
who
fell
down
in
a
race
and
was
obliged
to
look
for
his
spectacles
was
especially
appreciated
after
a
year
at
bonn
the
time
had
come
for
a
foreign
tour
and
baron
stockmar
arrived
from
england
to
accompany
the
prince
on
an
expedition
to
italy
the
baron
had
been
already
two
years
previously
consulted
by
king
leopold
as
to
his
views
upon
the
proposed
marriage
of
albert
and
victoria
his
reply
had
been
remarkable
with
a
characteristic
foresight
a
characteristic
absence
of
optimism
a
characteristic
sense
of
the
moral
elements
in
the
situation
stockmar
had
pointed
out
what
were
in
his
opinion
the
conditions
essential
to
make
the
marriage
a
success
albert
he
wrote
was
a
fine
young
fellow
well
grown
for
his
age
with
agreeable
and
valuable
qualities
and
it
was
probable
that
in
a
few
years
he
would
turn
out
a
strong
handsome
man
of
a
kindly
simple
yet
dignified
demeanour
thus
externally
he
possesses
all
that
pleases
the
sex
and
at
all
times
and
in
all
countries
must
please
supposing
therefore
that
victoria
herself
was
in
favour
of
the
marriage
the
further
question
arose
as
to
whether
albert
mental
qualities
were
such
as
to
fit
him
for
the
position
of
husband
of
the
queen
of
england
on
this
point
continued
the
baron
one
heard
much
to
his
credit
the
prince
was
said
to
be
discreet
and
intelligent
but
all
such
judgments
were
necessarily
partial
and
the
baron
preferred
to
reserve
his
opinion
until
he
could
come
to
a
trustworthy
conclusion
from
personal
observation
and
then
he
added
but
all
this
is
not
enough
the
young
man
ought
to
have
not
merely
great
ability
but
a
right
ambition
and
great
force
of
will
as
well
to
pursue
for
a
lifetime
a
political
career
so
arduous
demands
more
than
energy
and
inclination
it
demands
also
that
earnest
frame
of
mind
which
is
ready
of
its
own
accord
to
sacrifice
mere
pleasure
to
real
usefulness
if
he
is
not
satisfied
hereafter
with
the
consciousness
of
having
achieved
one
of
the
most
influential
positions
in
europe
how
often
will
he
feel
tempted
to
repent
his
adventure
if
he
does
not
from
the
very
outset
accept
it
as
a
vocation
of
grave
responsibility
on
the
efficient
performance
of
which
his
honour
and
happiness
depend
there
is
small
likelihood
of
his
succeeding
such
were
the
views
of
stockmar
on
the
qualifications
necessary
for
the
due
fulfilment
of
that
destiny
which
albert
family
had
marked
out
for
him
and
he
hoped
during
the
tour
in
italy
to
come
to
some
conclusion
as
to
how
far
the
prince
possessed
them
albert
on
his
side
was
much
impressed
by
the
baron
whom
he
had
previously
seen
but
rarely
he
also
became
acquainted
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
with
a
young
englishman
lieutenant
francis
seymour
who
had
been
engaged
to
accompany
him
whom
he
found
sehr
and
with
whom
he
struck
up
a
warm
friendship
he
delighted
in
the
galleries
and
scenery
of
florence
though
with
rome
he
was
less
impressed
but
for
some
beautiful
palaces
he
said
it
might
just
as
well
be
any
town
in
germany
in
an
interview
with
pope
gregory
xvi
he
took
the
opportunity
of
displaying
his
erudition
when
the
pope
observed
that
the
greeks
had
taken
their
art
from
the
etruscans
albert
replied
that
on
the
contrary
in
his
opinion
they
had
borrowed
from
the
egyptians
his
holiness
politely
acquiesced
wherever
he
went
he
was
eager
to
increase
his
knowledge
and
at
a
ball
in
florence
he
was
observed
paying
no
attention
whatever
to
the
ladies
and
deep
in
conversation
with
the
learned
signor
capponi
voila
un
prince
dont
nous
pouvons
etre
fiers
said
the
grand
duke
of
tuscany
who
was
standing
by
la
belle
danseuse
le
savant
on
his
return
to
germany
stockmar
observations
imparted
to
king
leopold
were
still
critical
albert
he
said
was
intelligent
kind
and
amiable
he
was
full
of
the
best
intentions
and
the
noblest
resolutions
and
his
judgment
was
in
many
things
beyond
his
years
but
great
exertion
was
repugnant
to
him
he
seemed
to
be
too
willing
to
spare
himself
and
his
good
resolutions
too
often
came
to
nothing
it
was
particularly
unfortunate
that
he
took
not
the
slightest
interest
in
politics
and
never
read
a
newspaper
in
his
manners
too
there
was
still
room
for
improvement
he
will
always
said
the
baron
have
more
success
with
men
than
with
women
in
whose
society
he
shows
too
little
empressement
and
is
too
indifferent
and
retiring
one
other
feature
of
the
case
was
noted
by
the
keen
eye
of
the
old
physician
the
constitution
was
not
a
strong
one
yet
on
the
whole
he
was
favourable
to
the
projected
marriage
but
by
now
the
chief
obstacle
seemed
to
lie
in
another
quarter
victoria
was
apparently
determined
to
commit
herself
to
nothing
and
so
it
happened
that
when
albert
went
to
england
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
withdraw
entirely
from
the
affair
nothing
would
induce
him
he
confessed
to
a
friend
to
be
kept
vaguely
waiting
he
would
break
it
all
off
at
once
his
reception
at
windsor
threw
an
entirely
new
light
upon
the
situation
the
wheel
of
fortune
turned
with
a
sudden
rapidity
and
he
found
in
the
arms
of
victoria
the
irrevocable
assurance
of
his
overwhelming
fate
ii
he
was
not
in
love
with
her
affection
gratitude
the
natural
reactions
to
the
unqualified
devotion
of
a
lively
young
cousin
who
was
also
a
queen
such
feelings
possessed
him
but
the
ardours
of
reciprocal
passion
were
not
his
though
he
found
that
he
liked
victoria
very
much
what
immediately
interested
him
in
his
curious
position
was
less
her
than
himself
dazzled
and
delighted
riding
dancing
singing
laughing
amid
the
splendours
of
windsor
he
was
aware
of
a
new
sensation
the
stirrings
of
ambition
in
his
breast
his
place
would
indeed
be
a
high
an
enviable
one
and
then
on
the
instant
came
another
thought
the
teaching
of
religion
the
admonitions
of
stockmar
his
own
inmost
convictions
all
spoke
with
the
same
utterance
he
would
not
be
there
to
please
himself
but
for
a
very
different
purpose
to
do
good
he
must
be
noble
manly
and
princely
in
all
things
he
would
have
to
live
and
to
sacrifice
himself
for
the
benefit
of
his
new
country
to
use
his
powers
and
endeavours
for
a
great
object
that
of
promoting
the
welfare
of
multitudes
of
his
fellowmen
one
serious
thought
led
on
to
another
the
wealth
and
the
bustle
of
the
english
court
might
be
delightful
for
the
moment
but
after
all
it
was
coburg
that
had
his
heart
while
i
shall
be
untiring
he
wrote
to
his
grandmother
in
my
efforts
and
labours
for
the
country
to
which
i
shall
in
future
belong
and
where
i
am
called
to
so
high
a
position
i
shall
never
cease
ein
treuer
deutscher
coburger
gothaner
zu
sein
and
now
he
must
part
from
coburg
for
ever
sobered
and
sad
he
sought
relief
in
his
brother
company
the
two
young
men
would
shut
themselves
up
together
and
sitting
down
at
the
pianoforte
would
escape
from
the
present
and
the
future
in
the
sweet
familiar
gaiety
of
a
haydn
duet
they
returned
to
germany
and
while
albert
for
a
few
farewell
months
enjoyed
for
the
last
time
the
happiness
of
home
victoria
for
the
last
time
resumed
her
old
life
in
london
and
windsor
she
corresponded
daily
with
her
future
husband
in
a
mingled
flow
of
german
and
english
but
the
accustomed
routine
reasserted
itself
the
business
and
the
pleasures
of
the
day
would
brook
no
interruption
lord
was
once
more
constantly
beside
her
and
the
tories
were
as
intolerable
as
ever
indeed
they
were
more
so
for
now
in
these
final
moments
the
old
feud
burst
out
with
redoubled
fury
the
impetuous
sovereign
found
to
her
chagrin
that
there
might
be
disadvantages
in
being
the
declared
enemy
of
one
of
the
great
parties
in
the
state
on
two
occasions
the
tories
directly
thwarted
her
in
a
matter
on
which
she
had
set
her
heart
she
wished
her
husband
rank
to
be
axed
by
statute
and
their
opposition
prevented
it
she
wished
her
husband
to
receive
a
settlement
from
the
nation
of
a
year
and
again
owing
to
the
tories
he
was
only
allowed
it
was
too
bad
when
the
question
was
discussed
in
parliament
it
had
been
pointed
out
that
the
bulk
of
the
population
was
suffering
from
great
poverty
and
that
was
the
whole
revenue
of
coburg
but
her
uncle
leopold
had
been
given
and
it
would
be
monstrous
to
give
albert
less
sir
robert
peel
it
might
have
been
expected
had
had
the
effrontery
to
speak
and
vote
for
the
smaller
sum
she
was
very
angry
and
determined
to
revenge
herself
by
omitting
to
invite
a
single
tory
to
her
wedding
she
would
make
an
exception
in
favour
of
old
lord
liverpool
but
even
the
duke
of
wellington
she
refused
to
ask
when
it
was
represented
to
her
that
it
would
amount
to
a
national
scandal
if
the
duke
were
absent
from
her
wedding
she
was
angrier
than
ever
what
that
old
rebel
i
wo
have
him
she
was
reported
to
have
said
eventually
she
was
induced
to
send
him
an
invitation
but
she
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
the
bitterness
of
her
feelings
and
the
duke
himself
was
only
too
well
aware
of
all
that
had
passed
nor
was
it
only
against
the
tories
that
her
irritation
rose
as
the
time
for
her
wedding
approached
her
temper
grew
steadily
sharper
and
more
arbitrary
queen
adelaide
annoyed
her
king
leopold
too
was
ungracious
in
his
correspondence
dear
uncle
she
told
albert
is
given
to
believe
that
he
must
rule
the
roost
everywhere
however
she
added
with
asperity
that
is
not
a
necessity
even
albert
himself
was
not
impeccable
engulfed
in
coburgs
he
failed
to
appreciate
the
complexity
of
english
affairs
there
were
difficulties
about
his
household
he
had
a
notion
that
he
ought
not
to
be
surrounded
by
violent
whigs
very
likely
but
he
would
not
understand
that
the
only
alternatives
to
violent
whigs
were
violent
tories
and
it
would
be
preposterous
if
his
lords
and
gentlemen
were
to
be
found
voting
against
the
queen
he
wanted
to
appoint
his
own
private
secretary
but
how
could
he
choose
the
right
person
lord
was
obviously
best
qualified
to
make
the
appointment
and
lord
had
decided
that
the
prince
should
take
over
his
own
private
secretary
george
anson
a
staunch
whig
albert
protested
but
it
was
useless
victoria
simply
announced
that
anson
was
appointed
and
instructed
lehzen
to
send
the
prince
an
explanation
of
the
details
of
the
case
then
again
he
had
written
anxiously
upon
the
necessity
of
maintaining
unspotted
the
moral
purity
of
the
court
lord
m
pupil
considered
that
dear
albert
was
and
in
a
brisk
missive
set
forth
her
own
views
i
like
lady
very
much
she
told
him
only
she
is
a
little
strict
awl
particular
and
too
severe
towards
others
which
is
not
right
for
i
think
one
ought
always
to
be
indulgent
towards
other
people
as
i
always
think
if
we
had
not
been
well
taken
care
of
we
might
also
have
gone
astray
that
is
always
my
feeling
yet
it
is
always
right
to
show
that
one
does
not
like
to
see
what
is
obviously
wrong
but
it
is
very
dangerous
to
be
too
severe
and
i
am
certain
that
as
a
rule
such
people
always
greatly
regret
that
in
their
youth
they
have
not
been
so
careful
as
they
ought
to
have
been
i
have
explained
this
so
badly
and
written
it
so
badly
that
i
fear
you
will
hardly
be
able
to
make
it
out
on
one
other
matter
she
was
insistent
since
the
affair
of
lady
flora
hastings
a
sad
fate
had
overtaken
sir
james
clark
his
flourishing
practice
had
quite
collapsed
nobody
would
go
to
him
any
more
but
the
queen
remained
faithful
she
would
show
the
world
how
little
she
cared
for
their
disapproval
and
she
desired
albert
to
make
poor
clark
his
physician
in
ordinary
he
did
as
he
was
told
but
as
it
turned
out
the
appointment
was
not
a
happy
one
the
was
fixed
and
it
was
time
for
albert
to
tear
himself
away
from
his
family
and
the
scenes
of
his
childhood
with
an
aching
heart
he
had
revisited
his
beloved
haunts
the
woods
and
the
valleys
where
he
had
spent
so
many
happy
hours
shooting
rabbits
and
collecting
botanical
specimens
in
deep
depression
he
had
sat
through
the
farewell
banquets
in
the
palace
and
listened
to
the
freischutz
performed
by
the
state
band
it
was
time
to
go
the
streets
were
packed
as
he
drove
through
them
for
a
short
space
his
eyes
were
gladdened
by
a
sea
of
friendly
german
faces
and
his
ears
by
a
gathering
volume
of
good
guttural
sounds
he
stopped
to
bid
a
last
adieu
to
his
grandmother
it
was
a
heartrending
moment
albert
albert
she
shrieked
and
fell
fainting
into
the
arms
of
her
attendants
as
his
carriage
drove
away
he
was
whirled
rapidly
to
his
destiny
at
calais
a
steamboat
awaited
him
and
together
with
his
father
and
his
brother
he
stepped
dejected
on
board
a
little
later
he
was
more
dejected
still
the
crossing
was
a
very
rough
one
the
duke
went
hurriedly
below
while
the
two
princes
we
are
told
lay
on
either
side
of
the
cabin
staircase
in
an
almost
helpless
state
at
dover
a
large
crowd
was
collected
on
the
pier
and
it
was
by
no
common
effort
that
prince
albert
who
had
continued
to
suffer
up
to
the
last
moment
got
up
to
bow
to
the
people
his
sense
of
duty
triumphed
it
was
a
curious
omen
his
whole
life
in
england
was
foreshadowed
as
he
landed
on
english
ground
meanwhile
victoria
in
growing
agitation
was
a
prey
to
temper
and
to
nerves
she
grew
feverish
and
at
last
sir
james
clark
pronounced
that
she
was
going
to
have
the
measles
but
once
again
sir
diagnosis
was
incorrect
it
was
not
the
measles
that
were
attacking
her
but
a
very
different
malady
she
was
suddenly
prostrated
by
alarm
regret
and
doubt
for
two
years
she
had
been
her
own
mistress
the
two
happiest
years
by
far
of
her
life
and
now
it
was
all
to
end
she
was
to
come
under
an
alien
domination
she
would
have
to
promise
that
she
would
honour
and
obey
someone
who
might
after
all
thwart
her
oppose
her
and
how
dreadful
that
would
be
why
had
she
embarked
on
this
hazardous
experiment
why
had
she
not
been
contented
with
lord
no
doubt
she
loved
albert
but
she
loved
power
too
at
any
rate
one
thing
was
certain
she
might
be
albert
wife
but
she
would
always
be
queen
of
england
he
reappeared
in
an
exquisite
uniform
and
her
hesitations
melted
in
his
presence
like
mist
before
the
sun
on
february
the
marriage
took
place
the
wedded
pair
drove
down
to
windsor
but
they
were
not
of
course
entirely
alone
they
were
accompanied
by
their
suites
and
in
particular
by
two
persons
the
baron
stockmar
and
the
baroness
lehzen
iii
albert
had
foreseen
that
his
married
life
would
not
be
all
plain
sailing
but
he
had
by
no
means
realised
the
gravity
and
the
complication
of
the
difficulties
which
he
would
have
to
face
politically
he
was
a
cipher
lord
melbourne
was
not
only
prime
minister
he
was
in
effect
the
private
secretary
of
the
queen
and
thus
controlled
the
whole
of
the
political
existence
of
the
sovereign
a
queen
husband
was
an
entity
unknown
to
the
british
constitution
in
state
affairs
there
seemed
to
be
no
place
for
him
nor
was
victoria
herself
at
all
unwilling
that
this
should
be
so
the
english
she
had
told
the
prince
when
during
their
engagement
a
proposal
had
been
made
to
give
him
a
peerage
are
very
jealous
of
any
foreigner
interfering
in
the
government
of
this
country
and
have
already
in
some
of
the
papers
expressed
a
hope
that
you
would
not
interfere
now
though
i
know
you
never
would
still
if
you
were
a
peer
they
would
all
say
the
prince
meant
to
play
a
political
part
i
know
you
never
would
in
reality
she
was
not
quite
so
certain
but
she
wished
albert
to
understand
her
views
he
would
she
hoped
make
a
perfect
husband
but
as
for
governing
the
country
he
would
see
that
she
and
lord
between
them
could
manage
that
very
well
without
his
help
but
it
was
not
only
in
politics
that
the
prince
discovered
that
the
part
cut
out
for
him
was
a
negligible
one
even
as
a
husband
he
found
his
functions
were
to
be
of
an
extremely
limited
kind
over
the
whole
of
victoria
private
life
the
baroness
reigned
supreme
and
she
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
allowing
that
supremacy
to
be
diminished
by
one
iota
since
the
accession
her
power
had
greatly
increased
besides
the
undefined
and
enormous
influence
which
she
exercised
through
her
management
of
the
queen
private
correspondence
she
was
now
the
superintendent
of
the
royal
establishment
and
controlled
the
important
office
of
privy
purse
albert
very
soon
perceived
that
he
was
not
master
in
his
own
house
every
detail
of
his
own
and
his
wife
existence
was
supervised
by
a
third
person
nothing
could
be
done
until
the
consent
of
lehzen
had
first
been
obtained
and
victoria
who
adored
lehzen
with
unabated
intensity
saw
nothing
in
all
this
that
was
wrong
nor
was
the
prince
happier
in
his
social
surroundings
a
shy
young
foreigner
awkward
in
ladies
company
unexpansive
and
it
was
improbable
that
in
any
circumstances
he
would
have
been
a
society
success
his
appearance
too
was
against
him
though
in
the
eyes
of
victoria
he
was
the
mirror
of
manly
beauty
her
subjects
whose
eyes
were
of
a
less
teutonic
cast
did
not
agree
with
her
to
them
and
particularly
to
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
naturally
saw
him
most
what
was
immediately
and
distressingly
striking
in
albert
face
and
figure
and
whole
demeanour
was
his
look
his
features
were
regular
no
doubt
but
there
was
something
smooth
and
smug
about
them
he
was
tall
but
he
was
clumsily
put
together
and
he
walked
with
a
slight
slouch
really
they
thought
this
youth
was
more
like
some
kind
of
foreign
tenor
than
anything
else
these
were
serious
disadvantages
but
the
line
of
conduct
which
the
prince
adopted
from
the
first
moment
of
his
arrival
was
far
from
calculated
to
dispel
them
owing
partly
to
a
natural
awkwardness
partly
to
a
fear
of
undue
familiarity
and
partly
to
a
desire
to
be
absolutely
correct
his
manners
were
infused
with
an
extraordinary
stiffness
and
formality
whenever
he
appeared
in
company
he
seemed
to
be
surrounded
by
a
thick
hedge
of
prickly
etiquette
he
never
went
out
into
ordinary
society
he
never
walked
in
the
streets
of
london
he
was
invariably
accompanied
by
an
equerry
when
he
rode
or
drove
he
wanted
to
be
irreproachable
and
if
that
involved
friendlessness
it
could
not
be
helped
besides
he
had
no
very
high
opinion
of
the
english
so
far
as
he
could
see
they
cared
for
nothing
but
and
sunday
observances
they
oscillated
between
an
undue
frivolity
and
an
undue
gloom
if
you
spoke
to
them
of
friendly
joyousness
they
stared
and
they
did
not
understand
either
the
laws
of
thought
or
the
wit
of
a
german
university
since
it
was
clear
that
with
such
people
he
could
have
very
little
in
common
there
was
no
reason
whatever
for
relaxing
in
their
favour
the
rules
of
etiquette
in
strict
privacy
he
could
be
natural
and
charming
seymour
and
anson
were
devoted
to
him
and
he
returned
their
affection
but
they
were
subordinates
the
receivers
of
his
confidences
and
the
agents
of
his
will
from
the
support
and
the
solace
of
true
companionship
he
was
utterly
cut
off
a
friend
indeed
he
had
or
rather
a
mentor
the
baron
established
once
more
in
the
royal
residence
was
determined
to
work
with
as
wholehearted
a
detachment
for
the
prince
benefit
as
more
than
twenty
years
before
he
had
worked
for
his
uncle
the
situations
then
and
now
similar
in
many
respects
were
yet
full
of
differences
perhaps
in
either
case
the
difficulties
to
be
encountered
were
equally
great
but
the
present
problem
was
the
more
complex
and
the
more
interesting
the
young
doctor
who
unknown
and
insignificant
had
nothing
at
the
back
of
him
but
his
own
wits
and
the
friendship
of
an
unimportant
prince
had
been
replaced
by
the
accomplished
confidant
of
kings
and
ministers
ripe
in
years
in
reputation
and
in
the
wisdom
of
a
vast
experience
it
was
possible
for
him
to
treat
albert
with
something
of
the
affectionate
authority
of
a
father
but
on
the
other
hand
albert
was
no
leopold
as
the
baron
was
very
well
aware
he
had
none
of
his
uncle
rigidity
of
ambition
none
of
his
overweening
impulse
to
be
personally
great
he
was
virtuous
and
he
was
clever
and
but
he
took
no
interest
in
politics
and
there
were
no
signs
that
he
possessed
any
commanding
force
of
character
left
to
himself
he
would
almost
certainly
have
subsided
into
a
nonentity
an
aimless
dilettante
busy
over
culture
a
palace
appendage
without
influence
or
power
but
he
was
not
left
to
himself
stockmar
saw
to
that
for
ever
at
his
pupil
elbow
the
hidden
baron
pushed
him
forward
with
tireless
pressure
along
the
path
which
had
been
trod
by
leopold
so
many
years
ago
but
this
time
the
goal
at
the
end
of
it
was
something
more
than
the
mediocre
royalty
that
leopold
had
reached
the
prize
which
stockmar
with
all
the
energy
of
disinterested
devotion
had
determined
should
be
albert
was
a
tremendous
prize
indeed
the
beginning
of
the
undertaking
proved
to
be
the
most
arduous
part
of
it
albert
was
easily
dispirited
what
was
the
use
of
struggling
to
perform
in
a
role
which
bored
him
and
which
it
was
quite
clear
nobody
but
the
dear
good
baron
had
any
desire
that
he
should
take
up
it
was
simpler
and
it
saved
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
let
things
slide
but
stockmar
would
not
have
it
incessantly
he
harped
upon
two
strings
albert
sense
of
duty
and
his
personal
pride
had
the
prince
forgotten
the
noble
aims
to
which
his
life
was
to
be
devoted
and
was
he
going
to
allow
himself
his
wife
his
family
his
whole
existence
to
be
governed
by
baroness
lehzen
the
latter
consideration
was
a
potent
one
albert
had
never
been
accustomed
to
giving
way
and
now
more
than
ever
before
it
would
be
humiliating
to
do
so
not
only
was
he
constantly
exasperated
by
the
position
of
the
baroness
in
the
royal
household
there
was
another
and
a
still
more
serious
cause
of
complaint
he
was
he
knew
very
well
his
wife
intellectual
superior
and
yet
he
found
to
his
intense
annoyance
that
there
were
parts
of
her
mind
over
which
he
exercised
no
influence
when
urged
on
by
the
baron
he
attempted
to
discuss
politics
with
victoria
she
eluded
the
subject
drifted
into
generalities
and
then
began
to
talk
of
something
else
she
was
treating
him
as
she
had
once
treated
their
uncle
leopold
when
at
last
he
protested
she
replied
that
her
conduct
was
merely
the
result
of
indolence
that
when
she
was
with
him
she
could
not
bear
to
bother
her
head
with
anything
so
dull
as
politics
the
excuse
was
worse
than
the
fault
was
he
the
wife
and
she
the
husband
it
almost
seemed
so
but
the
baron
declared
that
the
root
of
the
mischief
was
lehzen
that
it
was
she
who
encouraged
the
queen
to
have
secrets
who
did
worse
undermined
the
natural
ingenuousness
of
victoria
and
induced
her
to
give
unconsciously
no
doubt
false
reasons
to
explain
away
her
conduct
minor
disagreements
made
matters
worse
the
royal
couple
differed
in
their
tastes
albert
brought
up
in
a
regime
of
spartan
simplicity
and
early
hours
found
the
great
court
functions
intolerably
wearisome
and
was
invariably
observed
to
be
nodding
on
the
sofa
at
ten
while
the
queen
favourite
form
of
enjoyment
was
to
dance
through
the
night
and
then
going
out
into
the
portico
of
the
palace
watch
the
sun
rise
behind
paul
and
the
towers
of
westminster
she
loved
london
and
he
detested
it
it
was
only
in
windsor
that
he
felt
he
could
really
breathe
but
windsor
too
had
its
terrors
though
during
the
day
there
he
could
paint
and
walk
and
play
on
the
piano
after
dinner
black
tedium
descended
like
a
pall
he
would
have
liked
to
summon
distinguished
scientific
and
literary
men
to
his
presence
and
after
ascertaining
their
views
upon
various
points
of
art
and
learning
to
set
forth
his
own
but
unfortunately
victoria
had
no
fancy
to
encourage
such
people
knowing
that
she
was
unequal
to
taking
a
part
in
their
conversation
she
insisted
that
the
evening
routine
should
remain
unaltered
the
regulation
interchange
of
platitudes
with
official
persons
was
followed
as
usual
by
the
round
table
and
the
books
of
engravings
while
the
prince
with
one
of
his
attendants
played
game
after
game
of
double
chess
it
was
only
natural
that
in
so
peculiar
a
situation
in
which
the
elements
of
power
passion
and
pride
were
so
strangely
apportioned
there
should
have
been
occasionally
something
more
than
mere
irritation
a
struggle
of
angry
wills
victoria
no
more
than
albert
was
in
the
habit
of
playing
second
fiddle
her
arbitrary
temper
flashed
out
her
vitality
her
obstinacy
her
overweening
sense
of
her
own
position
might
well
have
beaten
down
before
them
his
superiorities
and
his
rights
but
she
fought
at
a
disadvantage
she
was
in
very
truth
no
longer
her
own
mistress
a
profound
preoccupation
dominated
her
seizing
upon
her
inmost
purposes
for
its
own
extraordinary
ends
she
was
madly
in
love
the
details
of
those
curious
battles
are
unknown
to
us
but
prince
ernest
who
remained
in
england
with
his
brother
for
some
months
noted
them
with
a
friendly
and
startled
eye
one
story
indeed
survives
and
perhaps
mythical
yet
summing
up
as
such
stories
often
do
the
central
facts
of
the
case
when
in
wrath
the
prince
one
day
had
locked
himself
into
his
room
victoria
no
less
furious
knocked
on
the
door
to
be
admitted
who
is
there
he
asked
the
queen
of
england
was
the
answer
he
did
not
move
and
again
there
was
a
hail
of
knocks
the
question
and
the
answer
were
repeated
many
times
but
at
last
there
was
a
pause
and
then
a
gentler
knocking
who
is
there
came
once
more
the
relentless
question
but
this
time
the
reply
was
different
your
wife
albert
and
the
door
was
immediately
opened
very
gradually
the
prince
position
changed
he
began
to
find
the
study
of
politics
less
uninteresting
than
he
had
supposed
he
read
blackstone
and
took
lessons
in
english
law
he
was
occasionally
present
when
the
queen
interviewed
her
ministers
and
at
lord
melbourne
suggestion
he
was
shown
all
the
despatches
relating
to
foreign
affairs
sometimes
he
would
commit
his
views
to
paper
and
read
them
aloud
to
the
prime
minister
who
infinitely
kind
and
courteous
listened
with
attention
but
seldom
made
any
reply
an
important
step
was
taken
when
before
the
birth
of
the
princess
royal
the
prince
without
any
opposition
in
parliament
was
appointed
regent
in
case
of
the
death
of
the
queen
stockmar
owing
to
whose
intervention
with
the
tories
this
happy
result
had
been
brought
about
now
felt
himself
at
liberty
to
take
a
holiday
with
his
family
in
coburg
but
his
solicitude
poured
out
in
innumerable
letters
still
watched
over
his
pupil
from
afar
dear
prince
he
wrote
i
am
satisfied
with
the
news
you
have
sent
me
mistakes
misunderstandings
obstructions
which
come
in
vexatious
opposition
to
one
views
are
always
to
be
taken
for
just
what
they
are
namely
natural
phenomena
of
life
which
represent
one
of
its
sides
and
that
the
shady
one
in
overcoming
them
with
dignity
your
mind
has
to
exercise
to
train
to
enlighten
itself
and
your
character
to
gain
force
endurance
and
the
necessary
hardness
the
prince
had
done
well
so
far
but
he
must
continue
in
the
right
path
above
all
he
was
never
to
relax
never
to
relax
in
putting
your
magnanimity
to
the
proof
never
to
relax
in
logical
separation
of
what
is
great
and
essential
from
what
is
trivial
and
of
no
moment
never
to
relax
in
keeping
yourself
up
to
a
high
standard
in
the
determination
daily
renewed
to
be
consistent
patient
courageous
it
was
a
hard
programme
perhaps
for
a
young
man
of
and
yet
there
was
something
in
it
which
touched
the
very
depths
of
albert
soul
he
sighed
but
he
listened
listened
as
to
the
voice
of
a
spiritual
director
inspired
with
divine
truth
the
stars
which
are
needful
to
you
now
the
voice
continued
and
perhaps
for
some
time
to
come
are
love
honesty
truth
all
those
whose
minds
are
warped
or
who
are
destitute
of
true
feeling
will
be
apt
to
mistake
you
and
to
persuade
themselves
and
the
world
that
you
are
not
the
man
you
are
or
at
least
may
become
do
you
therefore
be
on
the
alert
be
times
with
your
eyes
open
in
every
direction
i
wish
for
my
prince
a
great
noble
warm
and
true
heart
such
as
shall
serve
as
the
richest
and
surest
basis
for
the
noblest
views
of
human
nature
and
the
firmest
resolve
to
give
them
development
before
long
the
decisive
moment
came
there
was
a
general
election
and
it
became
certain
that
the
tories
at
last
must
come
into
power
the
queen
disliked
them
as
much
as
ever
but
with
a
large
majority
in
the
house
of
commons
they
would
now
be
in
a
position
to
insist
upon
their
wishes
being
attended
to
lord
melbourne
himself
was
the
first
to
realise
the
importance
of
carrying
out
the
inevitable
transition
with
as
little
friction
as
possible
and
with
his
consent
the
prince
following
up
the
rapprochement
which
had
begun
over
the
regency
act
opened
through
anson
a
negotiation
with
sir
robert
peel
in
a
series
of
secret
interviews
a
complete
understanding
was
reached
upon
the
difficult
and
complex
question
of
the
bedchamber
it
was
agreed
that
the
constitutional
point
should
not
be
raised
but
that
on
the
formation
of
the
tory
government
the
principal
whig
ladies
should
retire
and
their
places
be
filled
by
others
appointed
by
sir
robert
thus
in
effect
though
not
in
form
the
crown
abandoned
the
claims
of
and
they
have
never
been
subsequently
put
forward
the
transaction
was
a
turning
point
in
the
prince
career
he
had
conducted
an
important
negotiation
with
skill
and
tact
he
had
been
brought
into
close
and
friendly
relations
with
the
new
prime
minister
it
was
obvious
that
a
great
political
future
lay
before
him
victoria
was
much
impressed
and
deeply
grateful
my
dearest
angel
she
told
king
leopold
is
indeed
a
great
comfort
to
me
he
takes
the
greatest
interest
in
what
goes
on
feeling
with
and
for
me
and
yet
abstaining
as
he
ought
from
biasing
me
either
way
though
we
talk
much
on
the
subject
and
his
judgment
is
as
you
say
good
and
mild
she
was
in
need
of
all
the
comfort
and
assistance
he
could
give
her
lord
was
going
and
she
could
hardly
bring
herself
to
speak
to
peel
yes
she
would
discuss
everything
with
albert
now
stockmar
who
had
returned
to
england
watched
the
departure
of
lord
melbourne
with
satisfaction
if
all
went
well
the
prince
should
now
wield
a
supreme
political
influence
over
victoria
but
would
all
go
well
an
unexpected
development
put
the
baron
into
a
serious
fright
when
the
dreadful
moment
finally
came
and
the
queen
in
anguish
bade
adieu
to
her
beloved
minister
it
was
settled
between
them
that
though
it
would
be
inadvisable
to
meet
very
often
they
could
continue
to
correspond
never
were
the
inconsistencies
of
lord
melbourne
character
shown
more
clearly
than
in
what
followed
so
long
as
he
was
in
office
his
attitude
towards
peel
had
been
irreproachable
he
had
done
all
he
could
to
facilitate
the
change
of
government
he
had
even
through
more
than
one
channel
transmitted
privately
to
his
successful
rival
advice
as
to
the
best
means
of
winning
the
queen
good
graces
yet
no
sooner
was
he
in
opposition
than
his
heart
failed
him
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
surrendering
altogether
the
privilege
and
the
pleasure
of
giving
counsel
to
victoria
of
being
cut
off
completely
from
the
power
and
the
intimacy
which
had
been
his
for
so
long
and
in
such
abundant
measure
though
he
had
declared
that
he
would
be
perfectly
discreet
in
his
letters
he
could
not
resist
taking
advantage
of
the
opening
they
afforded
he
discussed
in
detail
various
public
questions
and
in
particular
gave
the
queen
a
great
deal
of
advice
in
the
matter
of
appointments
this
advice
was
followed
lord
melbourne
recommended
that
lord
heytesbury
who
he
said
was
an
able
man
should
be
made
ambassador
at
vienna
and
a
week
later
the
queen
wrote
to
the
foreign
secretary
urging
that
lord
heytesbury
whom
she
believed
to
be
a
very
able
man
should
be
employed
on
some
important
mission
stockmar
was
very
much
alarmed
he
wrote
a
memorandum
pointing
out
the
unconstitutional
nature
of
lord
melbourne
proceedings
and
the
unpleasant
position
in
which
the
queen
might
find
herself
if
they
were
discovered
by
peel
and
he
instructed
anson
to
take
this
memorandum
to
the
lord
melbourne
lounging
on
a
sofa
read
it
through
with
compressed
lips
this
is
quite
an
opinion
he
said
when
anson
ventured
to
expostulate
further
suggesting
that
it
was
unseemly
in
the
leader
of
the
opposition
to
maintain
an
intimate
relationship
with
the
sovereign
the
old
man
lost
his
temper
god
eternally
damn
it
he
exclaimed
leaping
up
from
his
sofa
and
dashing
about
the
room
flesh
and
blood
can
not
stand
this
he
continued
to
write
to
the
queen
as
before
and
two
more
violent
bombardments
from
the
baron
were
needed
before
he
was
brought
to
reason
then
gradually
his
letters
grew
less
and
less
frequent
with
fewer
and
fewer
references
to
public
concerns
at
last
they
were
entirely
innocuous
the
baron
smiled
lord
had
accepted
the
inevitable
the
whig
ministry
resigned
in
september
but
more
than
a
year
was
to
elapse
before
another
and
an
equally
momentous
change
was
effected
the
removal
of
lehzen
for
in
the
end
the
mysterious
governess
was
conquered
the
steps
are
unknown
by
which
victoria
was
at
last
led
to
accept
her
withdrawal
with
composure
perhaps
with
relief
but
it
is
clear
that
albert
domestic
position
must
have
been
greatly
strengthened
by
the
appearance
of
children
the
birth
of
the
princess
royal
had
been
followed
in
november
by
that
of
the
prince
of
wales
and
before
very
long
another
baby
was
expected
the
baroness
with
all
her
affection
could
have
but
a
remote
share
in
such
family
delights
she
lost
ground
perceptibly
it
was
noticed
as
a
phenomenon
that
once
or
twice
when
the
court
travelled
she
was
left
behind
at
windsor
the
prince
was
very
cautious
at
the
change
of
ministry
lord
melbourne
had
advised
him
to
choose
that
moment
for
decisive
action
but
he
judged
it
wiser
to
wait
time
and
the
pressure
of
inevitable
circumstances
were
for
him
every
day
his
predominance
grew
more
assured
and
every
night
at
length
he
perceived
that
he
need
hesitate
no
longer
that
every
wish
every
velleity
of
his
had
only
to
be
expressed
to
be
at
once
victoria
he
spoke
and
lehzen
vanished
for
ever
no
more
would
she
reign
in
that
royal
heart
and
those
royal
halls
no
more
watching
from
a
window
at
windsor
would
she
follow
her
pupil
and
her
sovereign
walking
on
the
terrace
among
the
obsequious
multitude
with
the
eye
of
triumphant
love
returning
to
her
native
hanover
she
established
herself
at
buckeburg
in
a
small
but
comfortable
house
the
walls
of
which
were
entirely
covered
by
portraits
of
her
majesty
the
baron
in
spite
of
his
dyspepsia
smiled
again
albert
was
supreme
iv
the
early
discords
had
passed
away
completely
resolved
into
the
absolute
harmony
of
married
life
victoria
overcome
by
a
new
an
unimagined
revelation
had
surrendered
her
whole
soul
to
her
husband
the
beauty
and
the
charm
which
so
suddenly
had
made
her
his
at
first
were
she
now
saw
no
more
than
but
the
outward
manifestation
of
the
true
albert
there
was
an
inward
beauty
an
inward
glory
which
blind
that
she
was
she
had
then
but
dimly
apprehended
but
of
which
now
she
was
aware
in
every
fibre
of
her
being
he
was
good
he
was
great
how
could
she
ever
have
dreamt
of
setting
up
her
will
against
his
wisdom
her
ignorance
against
his
knowledge
her
fancies
against
his
perfect
taste
had
she
really
once
loved
london
and
late
hours
and
dissipation
she
who
now
was
only
happy
in
the
country
she
who
jumped
out
of
bed
every
morning
oh
so
early
with
albert
to
take
a
walk
before
breakfast
with
albert
alone
how
wonderful
it
was
to
be
taught
by
him
to
be
told
by
him
which
trees
were
which
and
to
learn
all
about
the
bees
and
then
to
sit
doing
while
he
read
aloud
to
her
hallam
constitutional
history
of
england
or
to
listen
to
him
playing
on
his
new
organ
organ
is
the
first
of
instruments
he
said
or
to
sing
to
him
a
song
by
mendelssohn
with
a
great
deal
of
care
over
the
time
and
the
breathing
and
only
a
very
occasional
false
note
and
after
dinner
to
oh
how
good
of
him
he
had
given
up
his
double
chess
and
so
there
could
be
round
games
at
the
round
table
or
everyone
could
spend
the
evening
in
the
most
amusing
way
imaginable
spinning
counters
and
rings
when
the
babies
came
it
was
still
more
wonderful
pussy
was
such
a
clever
little
girl
i
am
not
pussy
i
am
the
princess
royal
she
had
angrily
exclaimed
on
one
occasion
and
bertie
well
she
could
only
pray
most
fervently
that
the
little
prince
of
wales
would
grow
up
to
resemble
his
angelic
dearest
father
in
every
every
respect
both
in
body
and
mind
her
dear
mamma
too
had
been
drawn
once
more
into
the
family
circle
for
albert
had
brought
about
a
reconciliation
and
the
departure
of
lehzen
had
helped
to
obliterate
the
past
in
eyes
life
had
become
an
idyll
and
if
the
essential
elements
of
an
idyll
are
happiness
love
and
simplicity
an
idyll
it
was
though
indeed
it
was
of
a
kind
that
might
have
disconcerted
theocritus
albert
brought
in
dearest
little
pussy
wrote
her
majesty
in
her
journal
in
such
a
smart
white
merino
dress
trimmed
with
blue
which
mamma
had
given
her
and
a
pretty
cap
and
placed
her
on
my
bed
seating
himself
next
to
her
and
she
was
very
dear
and
good
and
as
my
precious
invaluable
albert
sat
there
and
our
little
love
between
us
i
felt
quite
moved
with
happiness
and
gratitude
to
god
the
past
the
past
of
only
three
years
since
when
she
looked
back
upon
it
seemed
a
thing
so
remote
and
alien
that
she
could
explain
it
to
herself
in
no
other
way
than
as
some
kind
of
delusion
an
unfortunate
mistake
turning
over
an
old
volume
of
her
diary
she
came
upon
this
sentence
as
for
confidence
of
the
crown
god
knows
no
minister
no
friend
ever
possessed
it
so
entirely
as
this
truly
excellent
lord
melbourne
possesses
mine
a
pang
shot
through
her
she
seized
a
pen
and
wrote
upon
the
margin
reading
this
again
i
can
not
forbear
remarking
what
an
artificial
sort
of
happiness
mine
was
then
and
what
a
blessing
it
is
i
have
now
in
my
beloved
husband
real
and
solid
happiness
which
no
politics
no
worldly
reverses
can
change
it
could
not
have
lasted
long
as
it
was
then
for
after
all
kind
and
excellent
as
lord
is
and
kind
as
he
was
to
me
it
was
but
in
society
that
i
had
amusement
and
i
was
only
living
on
that
superficial
resource
which
i
then
fancied
was
happiness
thank
god
for
me
and
others
this
is
changed
and
i
know
what
real
happiness
is
how
did
she
know
what
is
the
distinction
between
happiness
that
is
real
and
happiness
that
is
felt
so
a
philosopher
lord
himself
perhaps
might
have
inquired
but
she
was
no
philosopher
and
lord
was
a
phantom
and
albert
was
beside
her
and
that
was
enough
happy
certainly
she
was
and
she
wanted
everyone
to
know
it
her
letters
to
king
leopold
are
sprinkled
thick
with
raptures
oh
my
dearest
uncle
i
am
sure
if
you
knew
how
happy
how
blessed
i
feel
and
how
proud
i
feel
in
possessing
such
a
perfect
being
as
my
husband
such
ecstasies
seemed
to
gush
from
her
pen
unceasingly
and
almost
of
their
own
accord
when
one
day
without
thinking
lady
lyttelton
described
someone
to
her
as
being
as
happy
as
a
queen
and
then
grew
a
little
confused
do
correct
yourself
lady
lyttelton
said
her
majesty
a
queen
is
a
very
happy
woman
but
this
new
happiness
was
no
lotus
dream
on
the
contrary
it
was
bracing
rather
than
relaxing
never
before
had
she
felt
so
acutely
the
necessity
for
doing
her
duty
she
worked
more
methodically
than
ever
at
the
business
of
state
she
watched
over
her
children
with
untiring
vigilance
she
carried
on
a
large
correspondence
she
was
occupied
with
her
farm
her
dairy
a
whole
multitude
of
household
avocations
from
morning
till
night
her
active
eager
little
body
hurrying
with
quick
steps
after
the
long
strides
of
albert
down
the
corridors
and
avenues
of
windsor
seemed
the
very
expression
of
her
spirit
amid
all
the
softness
the
deliciousness
of
unmixed
joy
all
the
liquescence
the
overflowings
of
inexhaustible
sentiment
her
native
rigidity
remained
a
vein
of
iron
said
lady
lyttelton
who
as
royal
governess
had
good
means
of
observation
runs
through
her
most
extraordinary
character
sometimes
the
delightful
routine
of
domestic
existence
had
to
be
interrupted
it
was
necessary
to
exchange
windsor
for
buckingham
palace
to
open
parliament
or
to
interview
official
personages
or
occasionally
to
entertain
foreign
visitors
at
the
castle
then
the
quiet
court
put
on
a
sudden
magnificence
and
sovereigns
from
over
the
seas
louis
philippe
or
the
king
of
prussia
or
the
king
of
saxony
found
at
windsor
an
entertainment
that
was
indeed
a
royal
one
few
spectacles
in
europe
it
was
agreed
produced
an
effect
so
imposing
as
the
great
waterloo
banqueting
hall
crowded
with
guests
in
sparkling
diamonds
and
blazing
uniforms
the
long
walls
hung
with
the
stately
portraits
of
heroes
and
the
tables
loaded
with
the
gorgeous
gold
plate
of
the
kings
of
england
but
in
that
wealth
of
splendour
the
most
imposing
spectacle
of
all
was
the
queen
the
little
hausfrau
who
had
spent
the
day
before
walking
out
with
her
children
inspecting
her
livestock
practicing
shakes
at
the
piano
and
filling
up
her
journal
with
adoring
descriptions
of
her
husband
suddenly
shone
forth
without
art
without
effort
by
a
spontaneous
and
natural
transition
the
very
culmination
of
majesty
the
tsar
of
russia
himself
was
deeply
impressed
victoria
on
her
side
viewed
with
secret
awe
the
tremendous
nicholas
a
great
event
and
a
great
compliment
his
visit
certainly
is
she
told
her
uncle
and
the
people
here
are
extremely
flattered
at
it
he
is
certainly
a
very
striking
man
still
very
handsome
his
profile
is
beautiful
and
his
manners
most
dignified
and
graceful
extremely
civil
quite
alarmingly
so
as
he
is
so
full
of
attentions
and
politeness
but
the
expression
of
the
eyes
is
formidable
and
unlike
anything
i
ever
saw
before
she
and
albert
and
the
good
king
of
saxony
who
happened
to
be
there
at
the
same
time
and
whom
she
said
we
like
much
he
is
so
drew
together
like
tame
villatic
fowl
in
the
presence
of
that
awful
eagle
when
he
was
gone
they
compared
notes
about
his
face
his
unhappiness
and
his
despotic
power
over
millions
well
she
for
her
part
could
not
help
pitying
him
and
she
thanked
god
she
was
queen
of
england
when
the
time
came
for
returning
some
of
these
visits
the
royal
pair
set
forth
in
their
yacht
much
to
victoria
satisfaction
i
do
love
a
ship
she
exclaimed
ran
up
and
down
ladders
with
the
greatest
agility
and
cracked
jokes
with
the
sailors
the
prince
was
more
aloof
they
visited
louis
philippe
at
the
chateau
they
visited
king
leopold
in
brussels
it
happened
that
a
still
more
remarkable
englishwoman
was
in
the
belgian
capital
but
she
was
not
remarked
and
queen
victoria
passed
unknowing
before
the
steady
gaze
of
one
of
the
mistresses
in
pensionnat
a
little
stout
vivacious
lady
very
plainly
dressed
not
much
dignity
or
pretension
about
her
was
charlotte
bronte
comment
as
the
royal
carriage
and
six
flashed
by
her
making
her
wait
on
the
pavement
for
a
moment
and
interrupting
the
train
of
her
reflections
victoria
was
in
high
spirits
and
even
succeeded
in
instilling
a
little
cheerfulness
into
her
uncle
sombre
court
king
leopold
indeed
was
perfectly
contented
his
dearest
hopes
had
been
fulfilled
all
his
ambitions
were
satisfied
and
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
had
only
to
enjoy
in
undisturbed
decorum
his
throne
his
respectability
the
table
of
precedence
and
the
punctual
discharge
of
his
irksome
duties
but
unfortunately
the
felicity
of
those
who
surrounded
him
was
less
complete
his
court
it
was
murmured
was
as
gloomy
as
a
conventicle
and
the
most
dismal
of
all
the
sufferers
was
his
wife
pas
de
plaisanteries
madame
he
had
exclaimed
to
the
unfortunate
successor
of
the
princess
charlotte
when
in
the
early
days
of
their
marriage
she
had
attempted
a
feeble
joke
did
she
not
understand
that
the
consort
of
a
constitutional
sovereign
must
not
be
frivolous
she
understood
at
last
only
too
well
and
when
the
startled
walls
of
the
state
apartments
to
the
chattering
and
the
laughter
of
victoria
the
poor
lady
found
that
she
had
almost
forgotten
how
to
smile
another
year
germany
was
visited
and
albert
displayed
the
beauties
of
his
home
when
victoria
crossed
the
frontier
she
was
much
excited
and
she
was
astonished
as
well
to
hear
the
people
speak
german
she
noted
in
her
diary
and
to
see
the
german
soldiers
seemed
to
me
so
singular
having
recovered
from
this
slight
shock
she
found
the
country
charming
she
was
feted
everywhere
crowds
of
the
surrounding
royalties
swooped
down
to
welcome
her
and
the
prettiest
groups
of
peasant
children
dressed
in
their
best
clothes
presented
her
with
bunches
of
flowers
the
principality
of
coburg
with
its
romantic
scenery
and
its
inhabitants
particularly
delighted
her
and
when
she
woke
up
one
morning
to
find
herself
in
dear
rosenau
my
albert
birthplace
it
was
like
a
beautiful
dream
on
her
return
home
she
expatiated
in
a
letter
to
king
leopold
upon
the
pleasures
of
the
trip
dwelling
especially
upon
the
intensity
of
her
affection
for
albert
native
land
i
have
a
feeling
she
said
for
our
dear
little
germany
which
i
can
not
describe
i
felt
it
at
rosenau
so
much
it
is
a
something
which
touches
me
and
which
goes
to
my
heart
and
makes
me
inclined
to
cry
i
never
felt
at
any
other
place
that
sort
of
pensive
pleasure
and
peace
which
i
felt
there
i
fear
i
almost
like
it
too
much
v
the
husband
was
not
so
happy
as
the
wife
in
spite
of
the
great
improvement
in
his
situation
in
spite
of
a
growing
family
and
the
adoration
of
victoria
albert
was
still
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
and
the
serenity
of
spiritual
satisfaction
was
denied
him
it
was
something
no
doubt
to
have
dominated
his
immediate
environment
but
it
was
not
enough
and
besides
in
the
very
completeness
of
his
success
there
was
a
bitterness
victoria
idolised
him
but
it
was
understanding
that
he
craved
for
not
idolatry
and
how
much
did
victoria
filled
to
the
brim
though
she
was
with
him
understand
him
how
much
does
the
bucket
understand
the
well
he
was
lonely
he
went
to
his
organ
and
improvised
with
learned
modulations
until
the
sounds
swelling
and
subsiding
through
elaborate
cadences
brought
some
solace
to
his
heart
then
with
the
elasticity
of
youth
he
hurried
off
to
play
with
the
babies
or
to
design
a
new
pigsty
or
to
read
aloud
the
church
history
of
scotland
to
victoria
or
to
pirouette
before
her
on
one
toe
like
a
with
a
fixed
smile
to
show
her
how
she
ought
to
behave
when
she
appeared
in
public
places
thus
did
he
amuse
himself
but
there
was
one
distraction
in
which
he
did
not
indulge
he
never
flirted
no
not
with
the
prettiest
ladies
of
the
court
when
during
their
engagement
the
queen
had
remarked
with
pride
to
lord
melbourne
that
the
prince
paid
no
attention
to
any
other
woman
the
cynic
had
answered
no
that
sort
of
thing
is
apt
to
come
later
upon
which
she
had
scolded
him
severely
and
then
hurried
off
to
stockmar
to
repeat
what
lord
had
said
but
the
baron
had
reassured
her
though
in
other
cases
he
had
replied
that
might
happen
he
did
not
think
it
would
in
albert
and
the
baron
was
right
throughout
their
married
life
no
rival
female
charms
ever
had
cause
to
give
victoria
one
moment
pang
of
jealousy
what
more
and
more
absorbed
him
bringing
with
it
a
curious
comfort
of
its
own
was
his
work
with
the
advent
of
peel
he
began
to
intervene
actively
in
the
affairs
of
the
state
in
more
ways
than
one
in
the
cast
of
their
intelligence
in
their
moral
earnestness
even
in
the
uneasy
formalism
of
their
manners
the
two
men
resembled
each
other
there
was
a
sympathy
between
them
and
thus
peel
was
ready
enough
to
listen
to
the
advice
of
stockmar
and
to
urge
the
prince
forward
into
public
life
a
royal
commission
was
about
to
be
formed
to
enquire
whether
advantage
might
not
be
taken
of
the
rebuilding
of
the
houses
of
parliament
to
encourage
the
fine
arts
in
the
united
kingdom
and
peel
with
great
perspicacity
asked
the
prince
to
preside
over
it
the
work
was
of
a
kind
which
precisely
suited
albert
his
love
of
art
his
love
of
method
his
love
of
coming
into
contact
close
yet
dignified
with
distinguished
men
it
satisfied
them
all
and
he
threw
himself
into
it
con
amore
some
of
the
members
of
the
commission
were
somewhat
alarmed
when
in
his
opening
speech
he
pointed
out
the
necessity
of
dividing
the
subjects
to
be
considered
into
the
word
they
thought
smacked
dangerously
of
german
metaphysics
but
their
confidence
returned
when
they
observed
his
royal
highness
extraordinary
technical
acquaintance
with
the
processes
of
fresco
painting
when
the
question
arose
as
to
whether
the
decorations
upon
the
walls
of
the
new
buildings
should
or
should
not
have
a
moral
purpose
the
prince
spoke
strongly
for
the
affirmative
although
many
he
observed
would
give
but
a
passing
glance
to
the
works
the
painter
was
not
therefore
to
forget
that
others
might
view
them
with
more
thoughtful
eyes
this
argument
convinced
the
commission
and
it
was
decided
that
the
subjects
to
be
depicted
should
be
of
an
improving
nature
the
frescoes
were
carried
out
in
accordance
with
the
commission
instructions
but
unfortunately
before
very
long
they
had
become
even
to
the
most
thoughtful
eyes
totally
invisible
it
seems
that
his
royal
highness
technical
acquaintance
with
the
processes
of
fresco
painting
was
incomplete
the
next
task
upon
which
the
prince
embarked
was
a
more
arduous
one
he
determined
to
reform
the
organisation
of
the
royal
household
this
reform
had
been
long
overdue
for
years
past
the
confusion
discomfort
and
extravagance
in
the
royal
residences
and
in
buckingham
palace
particularly
had
been
scandalous
no
reform
had
been
practicable
under
the
rule
of
the
baroness
but
her
functions
had
now
devolved
upon
the
prince
and
in
he
boldly
attacked
the
problem
three
years
earlier
stockmar
after
careful
enquiry
had
revealed
in
an
elaborate
memorandum
an
extraordinary
state
of
affairs
the
control
of
the
household
it
appeared
was
divided
in
the
strangest
manner
between
a
number
of
authorities
each
independent
of
the
other
each
possessed
of
vague
and
fluctuating
powers
without
responsibility
and
without
of
these
authorities
the
most
prominent
were
the
lord
steward
and
the
lord
chamberlain
noblemen
of
high
rank
and
political
importance
who
changed
office
with
every
administration
who
did
not
reside
with
the
court
and
had
no
effective
representatives
attached
to
it
the
distribution
of
their
respective
functions
was
uncertain
and
peculiar
in
buckingham
palace
it
was
believed
that
the
lord
chamberlain
had
charge
of
the
whole
of
the
rooms
with
the
exception
of
the
kitchen
sculleries
and
pantries
which
were
claimed
by
the
lord
steward
at
the
same
time
the
outside
of
the
palace
was
under
the
control
of
neither
of
these
functionaries
but
of
the
office
of
woods
and
forests
and
thus
while
the
insides
of
the
windows
were
cleaned
by
the
department
of
the
lord
chamberlain
or
possibly
in
certain
cases
of
the
lord
steward
the
office
of
woods
and
forests
cleaned
their
outsides
of
the
servants
the
housekeepers
the
pages
and
the
housemaids
were
under
the
authority
of
the
lord
chamberlain
the
clerk
of
the
kitchen
the
cooks
and
the
porters
were
under
that
of
the
lord
steward
but
the
footmen
the
and
the
took
their
orders
from
yet
another
official
the
master
of
the
horse
naturally
in
these
circumstances
the
service
was
extremely
defective
and
the
lack
of
discipline
among
the
servants
disgraceful
they
absented
themselves
for
as
long
as
they
pleased
and
whenever
the
fancy
took
them
and
if
as
the
baron
put
it
smoking
drinking
and
other
irregularities
occur
in
the
dormitories
where
footmen
sleep
ten
and
twelve
in
each
room
no
one
can
help
it
as
for
her
guests
there
was
nobody
to
show
them
to
their
rooms
and
they
were
often
left
having
utterly
lost
their
way
in
the
complicated
passages
to
wander
helpless
by
the
hour
the
strange
divisions
of
authority
extended
not
only
to
persons
but
to
things
the
queen
observed
that
there
was
never
a
fire
in
the
she
enquired
why
the
answer
was
the
lord
steward
lays
the
fire
and
the
lord
chamberlain
lights
it
the
underlings
of
those
two
great
noblemen
having
failed
to
come
to
an
accommodation
there
was
no
help
for
it
the
queen
must
eat
in
the
cold
a
surprising
incident
opened
everyone
eyes
to
the
confusion
and
negligence
that
reigned
in
the
palace
a
fortnight
after
the
birth
of
the
princess
royal
the
nurse
heard
a
suspicious
noise
in
the
room
next
to
the
queen
bedroom
she
called
to
one
of
the
pages
who
looking
under
a
large
sofa
perceived
there
a
crouching
figure
with
a
most
repulsive
appearance
it
was
the
boy
jones
this
enigmatical
personage
whose
escapades
dominated
the
newspapers
for
several
ensuing
months
and
whose
motives
and
character
remained
to
the
end
ambiguous
was
an
undersized
lad
of
the
son
of
a
tailor
who
had
apparently
gained
admittance
to
the
palace
by
climbing
over
the
garden
wall
and
walking
in
through
an
open
window
two
years
before
he
had
paid
a
similar
visit
in
the
guise
of
a
he
now
declared
that
he
had
spent
three
days
in
the
palace
hiding
under
various
beds
that
he
had
helped
himself
to
soup
and
other
eatables
and
that
he
had
sat
upon
the
throne
seen
the
queen
and
heard
the
princess
royal
squall
every
detail
of
the
strange
affair
was
eagerly
canvassed
the
times
reported
that
the
boy
jones
had
from
his
infancy
been
fond
of
reading
but
that
his
countenance
is
exceedingly
sullen
it
added
the
sofa
under
which
the
boy
jones
was
discovered
we
understand
is
one
of
the
most
costly
and
magnificent
material
and
workmanship
and
ordered
expressly
for
the
accommodation
of
the
royal
and
illustrious
visitors
who
call
to
pay
their
respects
to
her
majesty
the
culprit
was
sent
for
three
months
to
the
house
of
correction
when
he
emerged
he
immediately
returned
to
buckingham
palace
he
was
discovered
and
sent
back
to
the
house
of
correction
for
another
three
months
after
which
he
was
offered
a
week
by
a
music
hall
to
appear
upon
the
stage
he
refused
this
offer
and
shortly
afterwards
was
found
by
the
police
loitering
round
buckingham
palace
the
authorities
acted
vigorously
and
without
any
trial
or
process
of
law
shipped
the
boy
jones
off
to
sea
a
year
later
his
ship
put
into
portsmouth
to
refit
and
he
at
once
disembarked
and
walked
to
london
he
was
before
he
reached
the
palace
and
sent
back
to
his
ship
the
warspite
on
this
occasion
it
was
noticed
that
he
had
much
improved
in
personal
appearance
and
grown
quite
corpulent
and
so
the
boy
jones
passed
out
of
history
though
we
catch
one
last
glimpse
of
him
in
falling
overboard
in
the
night
between
tunis
and
algiers
he
was
fished
up
again
but
it
was
conjectured
as
one
of
the
warspite
officers
explained
in
a
letter
to
the
times
that
his
fall
had
not
been
accidental
but
that
he
had
deliberately
jumped
into
the
mediterranean
in
order
to
see
the
light
burning
of
a
boy
with
such
a
record
what
else
could
be
supposed
but
discomfort
and
alarm
were
not
the
only
results
of
the
mismanagement
of
the
household
the
waste
extravagance
and
peculation
that
also
flowed
from
it
were
immeasurable
there
were
preposterous
perquisites
and
malpractices
of
every
kind
it
was
for
instance
an
ancient
and
immutable
rule
that
a
candle
that
had
once
been
lighted
should
never
be
lighted
again
what
happened
to
the
old
candles
nobody
knew
again
the
prince
examining
the
accounts
was
puzzled
by
a
weekly
expenditure
of
shillings
on
red
room
wine
he
enquired
into
the
matter
and
after
great
difficulty
discovered
that
in
the
time
of
george
iii
a
room
in
windsor
castle
with
red
hangings
had
once
been
used
as
a
and
that
five
shillings
a
day
had
been
allowed
to
provide
wine
for
the
officers
the
guard
had
long
since
been
moved
elsewhere
but
the
payment
for
wine
in
the
red
room
continued
the
money
being
received
by
a
officer
who
held
the
sinecure
position
of
after
much
laborious
investigation
and
a
stiff
struggle
with
the
multitude
of
vested
interests
which
had
been
brought
into
being
by
long
years
of
neglect
the
prince
succeeded
in
effecting
a
complete
reform
the
various
conflicting
authorities
were
induced
to
resign
their
powers
into
the
hands
of
a
single
official
the
master
of
the
household
who
became
responsible
for
the
entire
management
of
the
royal
palaces
great
economies
were
made
and
the
whole
crowd
of
venerable
abuses
was
swept
away
among
others
the
unlucky
officer
of
the
red
room
was
much
to
his
surprise
given
the
choice
of
relinquishing
his
weekly
emolument
or
of
performing
the
duties
of
an
even
the
irregularities
among
the
footmen
were
greatly
diminished
there
were
outcries
and
complaints
the
prince
was
accused
of
meddling
of
injustice
and
of
saving
but
he
held
on
his
course
and
before
long
the
admirable
administration
of
the
royal
household
was
recognised
as
a
convincing
proof
of
his
perseverance
and
capacity
at
the
same
time
his
activity
was
increasing
enormously
in
a
more
important
sphere
he
had
become
the
queen
private
secretary
her
confidential
adviser
her
second
self
he
was
now
always
present
at
her
interviews
with
ministers
he
took
like
the
queen
a
special
interest
in
foreign
policy
but
there
was
no
public
question
in
which
his
influence
was
not
felt
a
double
process
was
at
work
while
victoria
fell
more
and
more
absolutely
under
his
intellectual
predominance
he
simultaneously
grew
more
and
more
completely
absorbed
by
the
machinery
of
high
politics
the
incessant
and
multifarious
business
of
a
great
state
nobody
any
more
could
call
him
a
dilettante
he
was
a
worker
a
public
personage
a
man
of
affairs
stockmar
noted
the
change
with
exultation
the
prince
he
wrote
has
improved
very
much
lately
he
has
evidently
a
head
for
politics
he
has
become
too
far
more
independent
his
mental
activity
is
constantly
on
the
increase
and
he
gives
the
greater
part
of
his
time
to
business
without
complaining
the
relations
between
husband
and
wife
added
the
baron
are
all
one
could
desire
long
before
peel
ministry
came
to
an
end
there
had
been
a
complete
change
in
victoria
attitude
towards
him
his
appreciation
of
the
prince
had
softened
her
heart
the
sincerity
and
warmth
of
his
nature
which
in
private
intercourse
with
those
whom
he
wished
to
please
had
the
power
of
gradually
dissipating
the
awkwardness
of
his
manners
did
the
rest
she
came
in
time
to
regard
him
with
intense
feelings
of
respect
and
attachment
she
spoke
of
our
worthy
peel
for
whom
she
said
she
had
an
extreme
admiration
and
who
had
shown
himself
a
man
of
unbounded
loyalty
courage
patriotism
and
and
his
conduct
towards
me
has
been
chivalrous
almost
i
might
say
she
dreaded
his
removal
from
office
almost
as
frantically
as
she
had
once
dreaded
that
of
lord
it
would
be
she
declared
a
great
calamity
six
years
before
what
would
she
have
said
if
a
prophet
had
told
her
that
the
day
would
come
when
she
would
be
horrified
by
the
triumph
of
the
whigs
yet
there
was
no
escaping
it
she
had
to
face
the
return
of
her
old
friends
in
the
ministerial
crises
of
and
the
prince
played
a
dominating
part
everybody
recognised
that
he
was
the
real
centre
of
the
negotiations
the
actual
controller
of
the
forces
and
the
functions
of
the
crown
the
process
by
which
this
result
was
reached
had
been
so
gradual
as
to
be
almost
imperceptible
but
it
may
be
said
with
certainty
that
by
the
close
of
peel
administration
albert
had
become
in
effect
the
king
of
england
vi
with
the
final
emergence
of
the
prince
came
the
final
extinction
of
lord
melbourne
a
year
after
his
loss
of
office
he
had
been
struck
down
by
a
paralytic
seizure
he
had
apparently
recovered
but
his
old
elasticity
had
gone
for
ever
moody
restless
and
unhappy
he
wandered
like
a
ghost
about
the
town
bursting
into
soliloquies
in
public
places
or
asking
odd
questions
suddenly
a
propos
de
bottes
i
be
hanged
if
i
do
it
for
you
my
lord
he
was
heard
to
say
in
the
hall
at
brooks
standing
by
himself
and
addressing
the
air
after
much
thought
you
consider
he
abruptly
asked
a
at
lady
holland
leaning
across
the
in
a
pause
of
the
conversation
that
it
was
a
most
damnable
act
of
henri
quatre
to
change
his
religion
with
a
view
to
securing
the
crown
he
sat
at
home
brooding
for
hours
in
miserable
solitude
he
turned
over
his
books
his
classics
and
his
testaments
but
they
brought
him
no
comfort
at
all
he
longed
for
the
return
of
the
past
for
the
impossible
for
he
knew
not
what
for
the
devilries
of
caro
for
the
happy
platitudes
of
windsor
his
friends
had
left
him
and
no
wonder
he
said
in
bitterness
the
fire
was
out
he
secretly
hoped
for
a
return
to
power
scanning
the
newspapers
with
solicitude
and
occasionally
making
a
speech
in
the
house
of
lords
his
correspondence
with
the
queen
continued
and
he
appeared
from
time
to
time
at
court
but
he
was
a
mere
simulacrum
of
his
former
self
the
dream
wrote
victoria
is
past
as
for
his
political
views
they
could
no
longer
be
tolerated
the
prince
was
an
ardent
free
trader
and
so
of
course
was
the
queen
and
when
dining
at
windsor
at
the
time
of
the
repeal
of
the
corn
laws
lord
melbourne
suddenly
exclaimed
it
a
damned
dishonest
act
everyone
was
extremely
embarrassed
her
majesty
laughed
and
tried
to
change
the
conversation
but
without
avail
lord
melbourne
returned
to
the
charge
again
and
again
with
i
say
it
damned
dishonest
until
the
queen
said
lord
melbourne
i
must
beg
you
not
to
say
anything
more
on
this
subject
now
and
then
he
held
his
tongue
she
was
kind
to
him
writing
him
long
letters
and
always
remembering
his
birthday
but
it
was
kindness
at
a
distance
and
he
knew
it
he
had
become
poor
lord
melbourne
a
profound
disquietude
devoured
him
he
tried
to
fix
his
mind
on
the
condition
of
agriculture
and
the
oxford
movement
he
wrote
long
memoranda
in
utterly
undecipherable
handwriting
he
was
convinced
that
he
had
lost
all
his
money
and
could
not
possibly
afford
to
be
a
knight
of
the
garter
he
had
run
through
everything
and
yet
if
peel
went
out
he
might
be
sent
for
why
not
he
was
never
sent
for
the
whigs
ignored
him
in
their
consultations
and
the
leadership
of
the
party
passed
to
lord
john
russell
when
lord
john
became
prime
minister
there
was
much
politeness
but
lord
melbourne
was
not
asked
to
join
the
cabinet
he
bore
the
blow
with
perfect
amenity
but
he
understood
at
last
that
that
was
the
end
for
two
years
more
he
lingered
sinking
slowly
into
unconsciousness
and
imbecility
sometimes
propped
up
in
his
chair
he
would
be
heard
to
murmur
with
unexpected
appositeness
the
words
of
samson
so
much
i
feel
my
general
spirit
droop
my
hopes
all
flat
nature
within
me
seems
in
all
her
functions
weary
of
herself
my
race
of
glory
run
and
race
of
shame
and
i
shall
shortly
be
with
them
that
rest
a
few
days
before
his
death
victoria
learning
that
there
was
no
hope
of
his
recovery
turned
her
mind
for
a
little
towards
that
which
had
once
been
lord
you
will
grieve
to
hear
she
told
king
leopold
that
our
good
dear
old
friend
melbourne
is
dying
one
can
not
forget
how
good
and
kind
and
amiable
he
was
and
it
brings
back
so
many
recollections
to
my
mind
though
god
knows
i
never
wish
that
time
back
again
she
was
in
little
danger
the
tide
of
circumstance
was
flowing
now
with
irresistible
fullness
towards
a
very
different
consummation
the
seriousness
of
albert
the
claims
of
her
children
her
own
inmost
inclinations
and
the
movement
of
the
whole
surrounding
world
combined
to
urge
her
forward
along
the
narrow
way
of
public
and
domestic
duty
her
family
steadily
increased
within
eighteen
months
of
the
birth
of
the
prince
of
wales
the
princess
alice
appeared
and
a
year
later
the
prince
alfred
and
then
the
princess
helena
and
two
years
afterwards
the
princess
louise
and
still
there
were
signs
that
the
pretty
row
of
royal
infants
was
not
complete
the
parents
more
and
more
involved
in
family
cares
and
family
happiness
found
the
pomp
of
windsor
galling
and
longed
for
some
more
intimate
and
remote
retreat
on
the
advice
of
peel
they
purchased
the
estate
of
osborne
in
the
isle
of
wight
their
skill
and
economy
in
financial
matters
had
enabled
them
to
lay
aside
a
substantial
sum
of
money
and
they
could
afford
out
of
their
savings
not
merely
to
buy
the
property
but
to
build
a
new
house
for
themselves
and
to
furnish
it
at
a
cost
of
at
osborne
by
the
and
among
the
woods
which
albert
with
memories
of
rosenau
in
his
mind
had
so
carefully
planted
the
royal
family
spent
every
hour
that
could
be
snatched
from
windsor
and
london
delightful
hours
of
deep
retirement
and
peaceful
work
the
public
looked
on
with
approval
a
few
aristocrats
might
sniff
or
titter
but
with
the
nation
at
large
the
queen
was
now
once
more
extremely
popular
the
in
particular
were
pleased
they
liked
a
they
liked
a
household
which
combined
the
advantages
of
royalty
and
virtue
and
in
which
they
seemed
to
see
reflected
as
in
some
resplendent
the
ideal
image
of
the
very
lives
they
led
themselves
their
own
existences
less
exalted
but
oh
so
soothingly
similar
acquired
an
added
excellence
an
added
succulence
from
the
early
hours
the
regularity
the
plain
tuckers
the
round
games
the
roast
beef
and
yorkshire
pudding
oft
osborne
it
was
indeed
a
model
court
not
only
were
its
central
personages
the
patterns
of
propriety
but
no
breath
of
scandal
no
shadow
of
indecorum
might
approach
its
utmost
boundaries
for
victoria
with
all
the
zeal
of
a
convert
upheld
now
the
standard
of
moral
purity
with
an
inflexibility
surpassing
if
that
were
possible
albert
own
she
blushed
to
think
how
she
had
once
believed
how
she
had
once
actually
told
him
that
one
might
be
too
strict
and
particular
in
such
matters
and
that
one
ought
to
be
indulgent
towards
other
people
dreadful
sins
but
she
was
no
longer
lord
m
pupil
she
was
albert
wife
she
was
more
the
embodiment
the
living
apex
of
a
new
era
in
the
generations
of
mankind
the
last
vestige
of
the
eighteenth
century
had
disappeared
cynicism
and
subtlety
were
shrivelled
into
powder
and
duty
industry
morality
and
domesticity
triumphed
over
them
even
the
very
chairs
and
tables
had
assumed
with
a
singular
responsiveness
the
forms
of
prim
solidity
the
victorian
age
was
in
full
swing
vii
only
one
thing
more
was
needed
material
expression
must
be
given
to
the
new
ideals
and
the
new
forces
so
that
they
might
stand
revealed
in
visible
glory
before
the
eyes
of
an
astonished
world
it
was
for
albert
to
supply
this
want
he
mused
and
was
inspired
the
great
exhibition
came
into
his
head
without
consulting
anyone
he
thought
out
the
details
of
his
conception
with
the
minutest
care
there
had
been
exhibitions
before
in
the
world
but
this
should
surpass
them
all
it
should
contain
specimens
of
what
every
country
could
produce
in
raw
materials
in
machinery
and
mechanical
inventions
in
manufactures
and
in
the
applied
and
plastic
arts
it
should
not
be
merely
useful
and
ornamental
it
should
teach
a
high
moral
lesson
it
should
be
an
international
monument
to
those
supreme
blessings
of
civilisation
peace
progress
and
prosperity
for
some
time
past
the
prince
had
been
devoting
much
of
his
attention
to
the
problems
of
commerce
and
industry
he
had
a
taste
for
machinery
of
every
kind
and
his
sharp
eye
had
more
than
once
detected
with
the
precision
of
an
expert
a
missing
in
some
vast
and
complicated
engine
a
visit
to
liverpool
where
he
opened
the
albert
dock
impressed
upon
his
mind
the
immensity
of
modern
industrial
forces
though
in
a
letter
to
victoria
describing
his
experiences
he
was
careful
to
retain
his
customary
lightness
of
touch
as
i
write
he
playfully
remarked
you
will
be
making
your
evening
toilette
and
not
be
ready
in
time
for
dinner
i
must
set
about
the
same
task
and
not
let
me
hope
with
the
same
result
the
loyalty
and
enthusiasm
of
the
inhabitants
are
great
but
the
heat
is
greater
still
i
am
satisfied
that
if
the
population
of
liverpool
had
been
weighed
this
morning
and
were
to
be
weighed
again
now
they
would
be
found
many
degrees
lighter
the
docks
are
wonderful
and
the
mass
of
shipping
incredible
in
art
and
science
he
had
been
deeply
interested
since
boyhood
his
reform
of
the
household
had
put
his
talent
for
organisation
beyond
a
doubt
and
thus
from
every
point
of
view
the
prince
was
well
qualified
for
his
task
having
matured
his
plans
he
summoned
a
small
committee
and
laid
an
outline
of
his
scheme
before
it
the
committee
approved
and
the
great
undertaking
was
set
on
foot
without
delay
two
years
however
passed
before
it
was
completed
for
two
years
the
prince
laboured
with
extraordinary
and
incessant
energy
at
first
all
went
smoothly
the
leading
manufacturers
warmly
took
up
the
idea
the
colonies
and
the
east
india
company
were
sympathetic
the
great
foreign
nations
were
eager
to
send
in
their
contributions
the
powerful
support
of
sir
robert
peel
was
obtained
and
the
use
of
a
site
in
hyde
park
selected
by
the
prince
was
sanctioned
by
the
government
out
of
plans
for
the
exhibition
building
the
prince
chose
that
of
joseph
paxton
famous
as
a
designer
of
gigantic
conservatories
and
the
work
was
on
the
point
of
being
put
in
hand
when
a
series
of
unexpected
difficulties
arose
opposition
to
the
whole
scheme
which
had
long
been
smouldering
in
various
quarters
suddenly
burst
forth
there
was
an
outcry
headed
by
the
times
against
the
use
of
the
park
for
the
exhibition
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
the
building
would
be
relegated
to
a
suburb
but
after
a
fierce
debate
in
the
house
the
supporters
of
the
site
in
the
park
won
the
day
then
it
appeared
that
the
project
lacked
a
sufficient
financial
backing
but
this
obstacle
too
was
surmounted
and
eventually
was
subscribed
as
a
guarantee
fund
the
enormous
glass
edifice
rose
higher
and
higher
covering
acres
and
enclosing
towering
elm
trees
beneath
its
roof
and
then
the
fury
of
its
enemies
reached
a
climax
the
fashionable
the
cautious
the
protectionists
the
pious
all
joined
in
the
hue
and
cry
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
exhibition
would
serve
as
a
rallying
point
for
all
the
ruffians
in
england
for
all
the
malcontents
in
europe
and
that
on
the
day
of
its
opening
there
would
certainly
be
a
riot
and
probably
a
revolution
it
was
asserted
that
the
glass
roof
was
porous
and
that
the
droppings
of
fifty
million
sparrows
would
utterly
destroy
every
object
beneath
it
agitated
nonconformists
declared
that
the
exhibition
was
an
arrogant
and
wicked
enterprise
which
would
infallibly
bring
down
punishment
upon
the
nation
colonel
sibthorpe
in
the
debate
on
the
address
prayed
that
hail
and
lightning
might
descend
from
heaven
on
the
accursed
thing
the
prince
with
unyielding
perseverance
and
infinite
patience
pressed
on
to
his
goal
his
health
was
seriously
affected
he
suffered
from
constant
sleeplessness
his
strength
was
almost
worn
out
but
he
remembered
the
injunctions
of
stockmar
and
never
relaxed
the
volume
of
his
labours
grew
more
prodigious
every
day
he
toiled
at
committees
presided
over
public
meetings
made
speeches
and
carried
on
communications
with
every
corner
of
the
civilised
world
and
his
efforts
were
rewarded
on
may
the
great
exhibition
was
opened
by
the
queen
before
an
enormous
concourse
of
persons
amid
scenes
of
dazzling
brilliancy
and
triumphant
enthusiasm
victoria
herself
was
in
a
state
of
excitement
which
bordered
on
delirium
she
performed
her
duties
in
a
trance
of
joy
gratitude
and
amazement
and
when
it
was
all
over
her
feelings
poured
themselves
out
into
her
journal
in
a
torrential
flood
the
day
had
been
nothing
but
an
endless
succession
of
glories
or
rather
one
vast
glory
one
vast
radiation
of
albert
everything
she
had
seen
everything
she
had
felt
or
heard
had
been
so
beautiful
so
wonderful
that
even
the
royal
underlinings
broke
down
under
the
burden
of
emphasis
while
her
remembering
pen
rushed
on
regardless
from
splendour
to
splendour
the
huge
crowds
so
well
behaved
and
of
all
the
nations
floating
the
inside
of
the
building
so
immense
with
myriads
of
people
and
the
sun
shining
through
the
roof
a
little
side

where
we
left
our
shawls
and

big

hear

from

sir

grey
in
tears
and
everybody
astonished
and
delighted
a
striking
incident
occurred
when
after
a
short
prayer
by
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
the
choir
of
voices
burst
into
the
hallelujah
chorus
at
that
moment
a
chinaman
dressed
in
full
national
costume
stepped
out
into
the
middle
of
the
central
nave
and
advancing
slowly
towards
the
royal
group
did
obeisance
to
her
majesty
the
queen
much
impressed
had
no
doubt
that
he
was
an
eminent
mandarin
and
when
the
final
procession
was
formed
orders
were
given
that
as
no
representative
of
the
celestial
empire
was
present
he
should
be
included
in
the
diplomatic
cortege
he
accordingly
with
the
utmost
gravity
followed
immediately
behind
the
ambassadors
he
subsequently
disappeared
and
it
was
rumoured
among
people
that
far
from
being
a
mandarin
the
fellow
was
a
mere
impostor
but
nobody
ever
really
discovered
the
nature
of
the
comments
that
had
been
lurking
behind
the
matchless
impassivity
of
that
yellow
face
a
few
days
later
victoria
poured
out
her
heart
to
her
uncle
the
first
of
may
she
said
was
the
greatest
day
in
our
history
the
most
beautiful
and
imposing
and
touching
spectacle
ever
seen
and
the
triumph
of
my
beloved
albert
it
was
the
happiest
proudest
day
in
my
life
and
i
can
think
of
nothing
else
albert
dearest
name
is
immortalised
with
this
great
conception
his
own
and
my
own
dear
country
showed
she
was
worthy
of
it
the
triumph
is
immense
it
was
the
enthusiasm
was
universal
even
the
bitterest
scoffers
were
converted
and
joined
in
the
chorus
of
praise
congratulations
from
public
bodies
poured
in
the
city
of
paris
gave
a
great
fete
to
the
exhibition
committee
and
the
queen
and
the
prince
made
a
triumphal
progress
through
the
north
of
england
the
financial
results
were
equally
remarkable
the
total
profit
made
by
the
exhibition
amounted
to
a
sum
of
which
was
employed
in
the
purchase
of
land
for
the
erection
of
a
permanent
national
museum
in
south
kensington
during
the
six
months
of
its
existence
in
hyde
park
over
six
million
persons
visited
it
and
not
a
single
accident
occurred
but
there
is
an
end
to
all
things
and
the
time
had
come
for
the
crystal
palace
to
be
removed
to
the
salubrious
seclusion
of
sydenham
victoria
sad
but
resigned
paid
her
final
visit
it
looked
so
beautiful
she
said
i
could
not
believe
it
was
the
last
time
i
was
to
see
it
an
organ
accompanied
by
a
fine
and
powerful
wind
instrument
called
the
sommerophone
was
being
played
and
it
nearly
upset
me
the
canvas
is
very
dirty
the
red
curtains
are
faded
and
many
things
are
very
much
soiled
still
the
effect
is
fresh
and
new
as
ever
and
most
beautiful
the
glass
fountain
was
already
removed
and
the
sappers
and
miners
were
rolling
about
the
little
boxes
just
as
they
did
at
the
beginning
it
made
us
all
very
melancholy
but
more
cheerful
thoughts
followed
when
all
was
over
she
expressed
her
boundless
satisfaction
in
a
dithyrambic
letter
to
the
prime
minister
her
beloved
husband
name
she
said
was
for
ever
immortalised
and
that
this
was
universally
recognised
by
the
country
was
a
source
to
her
of
immense
happiness
and
gratitude
she
feels
grateful
to
providence
her
majesty
concluded
to
have
permitted
her
to
be
united
to
so
great
so
noble
so
excellent
a
prince
and
this
year
will
ever
remain
the
proudest
and
happiest
of
her
life
the
day
of
the
closing
of
the
exhibition
which
the
queen
regretted
much
she
could
not
witness
was
the
twelfth
anniversary
of
her
betrothal
to
the
prince
which
is
a
curious
coincidence
chapter
lord
palmerston
i
in
the
prince
fortunes
reached
their
mark
the
success
of
the
great
exhibition
enormously
increased
his
reputation
and
seemed
to
assure
him
henceforward
a
leading
place
in
the
national
life
but
before
the
year
was
out
another
triumph
in
a
very
different
sphere
of
action
was
also
his
this
triumph
big
with
fateful
consequences
was
itself
the
outcome
of
a
series
of
complicated
circumstances
which
had
been
gathering
to
a
climax
for
many
years
the
unpopularity
of
albert
in
high
society
had
not
diminished
with
time
aristocratic
persons
continued
to
regard
him
with
disfavour
and
he
on
his
side
withdrew
further
and
further
into
a
contemptuous
reserve
for
a
moment
indeed
it
appeared
as
if
the
dislike
of
the
upper
classes
was
about
to
be
suddenly
converted
into
cordiality
for
they
learnt
with
amazement
that
the
prince
during
a
country
visit
had
ridden
to
hounds
and
acquitted
himself
remarkably
well
they
had
always
taken
it
for
granted
that
his
horsemanship
was
of
some
foreign
quality
and
here
he
was
jumping
gates
and
tearing
after
the
fox
as
if
he
had
been
born
and
bred
in
leicestershire
they
could
hardly
believe
it
was
it
possible
that
they
had
made
a
mistake
and
that
albert
was
a
good
fellow
after
all
had
he
wished
to
be
thought
so
he
would
certainly
have
seized
this
opportunity
purchased
several
hunters
and
used
them
constantly
but
he
had
no
such
desire
hunting
bored
him
and
made
victoria
nervous
he
continued
as
before
to
ride
as
he
himself
put
it
for
exercise
or
convenience
not
for
amusement
and
it
was
agreed
that
though
the
prince
no
doubt
could
keep
in
his
saddle
well
enough
he
was
no
sportsman
this
was
a
serious
matter
it
was
not
merely
that
albert
was
laughed
at
by
fine
ladies
and
sneered
at
by
fine
gentlemen
it
was
not
merely
that
victoria
who
before
her
marriage
had
cut
some
figure
in
society
had
under
her
husband
influence
almost
completely
given
it
up
since
charles
the
second
the
sovereigns
of
england
had
with
a
single
exception
always
been
unfashionable
and
the
fact
that
the
exception
was
george
the
fourth
seemed
to
give
an
added
significance
to
the
rule
what
was
grave
was
not
the
lack
of
fashion
but
the
lack
of
other
and
more
important
qualities
the
hostility
of
the
upper
classes
was
symptomatic
of
an
antagonism
more
profound
than
one
of
manners
or
even
of
tastes
the
prince
in
a
word
was
what
that
word
precisely
meant
it
was
difficult
to
say
but
the
fact
was
patent
to
every
eye
lord
palmerston
also
was
not
fashionable
the
great
whig
aristocrats
looked
askance
at
him
and
only
tolerated
him
as
an
unpleasant
necessity
thrust
upon
them
by
fate
but
lord
palmerston
was
english
through
and
through
there
was
something
in
him
that
expressed
with
extraordinary
vigour
the
fundamental
qualities
of
the
english
race
and
he
was
the
very
antithesis
of
the
prince
by
a
curious
chance
it
so
happened
that
this
typical
englishman
was
brought
into
closer
contact
than
any
other
of
his
countrymen
with
the
alien
from
over
the
sea
it
thus
fell
out
that
differences
which
in
more
fortunate
circumstances
might
have
been
smoothed
away
and
obliterated
became
accentuated
to
the
highest
pitch
all
the
mysterious
forces
in
soul
leapt
out
to
do
battle
with
his
adversary
and
in
the
long
and
violent
conflict
that
followed
it
almost
seemed
as
if
he
was
struggling
with
england
herself
palmerston
whole
life
had
been
spent
in
the
government
of
the
country
at
he
had
been
a
minister
at
he
had
been
offered
the
chancellorship
of
the
exchequer
which
with
that
prudence
which
formed
so
unexpected
a
part
of
his
character
he
had
declined
to
accept
his
first
spell
of
office
had
lasted
uninterruptedly
for
years
when
lord
grey
came
into
power
he
received
the
foreign
secretaryship
a
post
which
he
continued
to
occupy
with
two
intervals
for
another
years
throughout
this
period
his
reputation
with
the
public
had
steadily
grown
and
when
in
he
became
foreign
secretary
for
the
third
time
his
position
in
the
country
was
almost
if
not
quite
on
an
equality
with
that
of
the
prime
minister
lord
john
russell
he
was
a
tall
big
man
of
with
a
jaunty
air
a
large
face
dyed
whiskers
and
a
long
sardonic
upper
lip
his
private
life
was
far
from
respectable
but
he
had
greatly
strengthened
his
position
in
society
by
marrying
late
in
life
lady
cowper
the
sister
of
lord
melbourne
and
one
of
the
most
influential
of
the
whig
hostesses
powerful
experienced
and
supremely
he
naturally
paid
very
little
attention
to
albert
why
should
he
the
prince
was
interested
in
foreign
affairs
very
well
then
let
the
prince
pay
attention
to
him
to
him
who
had
been
a
cabinet
minister
when
albert
was
in
the
cradle
who
was
the
chosen
leader
of
a
great
nation
and
who
had
never
failed
in
anything
he
had
undertaken
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
not
that
he
wanted
the
prince
attention
far
from
it
so
far
as
he
could
see
albert
was
merely
a
young
foreigner
who
suffered
from
having
no
vices
and
whose
only
claim
to
distinction
was
that
he
had
happened
to
marry
the
queen
of
england
this
estimate
as
he
found
out
to
his
cost
was
a
mistaken
one
albert
was
by
no
means
insignificant
and
behind
albert
there
was
another
figure
by
no
means
insignificant
either
there
was
stockmar
but
palmerston
busy
with
his
plans
his
ambitions
and
the
management
of
a
great
department
brushed
all
such
considerations
on
one
side
it
was
his
favourite
method
of
action
he
lived
by
instinct
by
a
quick
eye
and
a
strong
hand
a
dexterous
management
of
every
crisis
as
it
arose
a
sense
of
the
vital
elements
in
a
situation
he
was
very
bold
and
nothing
gave
him
more
exhilaration
than
to
steer
the
ship
of
state
in
a
high
wind
on
a
rough
sea
with
every
stitch
of
canvas
on
her
that
she
could
carry
but
there
is
a
point
beyond
which
boldness
becomes
rashness
a
point
perceptible
only
to
intuition
and
not
to
reason
and
beyond
that
point
palmerston
never
went
when
he
saw
that
the
cast
demanded
it
he
could
go
slow
very
slow
indeed
in
fact
his
whole
career
so
full
of
vigorous
adventure
was
nevertheless
a
masterly
example
of
the
proverb
tout
vient
a
point
a
qui
sait
attendre
but
when
he
decided
to
go
quick
nobody
went
quicker
one
day
returning
from
osborne
he
found
that
he
had
missed
the
train
to
london
he
ordered
a
special
but
the
station
master
told
him
that
to
put
a
special
train
upon
the
line
at
that
time
of
day
would
be
dangerous
and
he
could
not
allow
it
palmerston
insisted
declaring
that
he
had
important
business
in
london
which
could
not
wait
the
supported
by
all
the
officials
continued
to
demur
the
company
he
said
could
not
possibly
take
the
responsibility
on
my
responsibility
then
said
palmerston
in
his
peremptory
way
whereupon
the
ordered
up
the
train
and
the
foreign
secretary
reached
london
in
time
for
his
work
without
an
accident
the
story
is
typical
of
the
happy
valiance
with
which
he
conducted
both
his
own
affairs
and
those
of
the
nation
england
he
used
to
say
is
strong
enough
to
brave
consequences
apparently
under
palmerston
guidance
she
was
while
the
officials
protested
and
shook
in
their
shoes
he
would
wave
them
away
with
his
airy
my
responsibility
and
carry
the
country
swiftly
along
the
line
of
his
choice
to
a
triumphant
destination
without
an
accident
his
immense
popularity
was
the
result
partly
of
his
diplomatic
successes
partly
of
his
extraordinary
personal
affability
but
chiefly
of
the
genuine
intensity
with
which
he
responded
to
the
feelings
and
supported
the
interests
of
his
countrymen
the
public
knew
that
it
had
in
lord
palmerston
not
only
a
master
but
also
a
devoted
servant
that
he
was
in
every
sense
of
the
word
a
public
man
when
he
was
prime
minister
he
noticed
that
iron
hurdles
had
been
put
up
on
the
grass
in
the
green
park
he
immediately
wrote
to
the
minister
responsible
ordering
in
the
severest
language
their
instant
removal
declaring
that
they
were
an
intolerable
nuisance
and
that
the
purpose
of
the
grass
was
to
be
walked
upon
freely
and
without
restraint
by
the
people
old
and
young
for
whose
enjoyment
the
parks
are
maintained
it
was
in
this
spirit
that
as
foreign
secretary
he
watched
over
the
interests
of
englishmen
abroad
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
for
englishmen
but
foreign
governments
were
less
pleased
they
found
lord
palmerston
interfering
exasperating
and
alarming
in
paris
they
spoke
with
bated
breath
of
ce
terrible
milord
palmerston
and
in
germany
they
made
a
little
song
about
him
hat
der
teufel
einen
sohn
so
ist
er
sicher
palmerston
but
their
complaints
their
threats
and
their
agitations
were
all
in
vain
palmerston
with
his
upper
lip
sardonically
curving
braved
consequences
and
held
on
his
course
the
first
diplomatic
crisis
which
arose
after
his
return
to
office
though
the
prince
and
the
queen
were
closely
concerned
with
it
passed
off
without
serious
disagreement
between
the
court
and
the
minister
for
some
years
past
a
curious
problem
had
been
perplexing
the
chanceries
of
europe
spain
ever
since
the
time
of
napoleon
a
prey
to
civil
convulsions
had
settled
down
for
a
short
interval
to
a
state
of
comparative
quiet
under
the
rule
of
christina
the
queen
mother
and
her
daughter
isabella
the
young
queen
in
the
question
of
isabella
marriage
which
had
for
long
been
the
subject
of
diplomatic
speculations
suddenly
became
acute
various
candidates
for
her
hand
were
proposed
among
others
two
cousins
of
her
own
another
spanish
prince
and
prince
leopold
of
a
first
cousin
of
and
albert
for
different
reasons
however
none
of
these
young
men
seemed
altogether
satisfactory
isabella
was
not
yet
sixteen
and
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
her
marriage
could
be
put
off
for
a
few
years
more
but
this
was
considered
to
be
out
of
the
question
vous
ne
savez
pas
said
a
high
authority
ce
que
que
ces
princesses
espagnoles
elles
ont
le
diable
au
corps
et
on
a
toujours
dit
que
si
nous
ne
nous
hations
pas
viendrait
avant
le
mari
it
might
also
have
been
supposed
that
the
young
queen
marriage
was
a
matter
to
be
settled
by
herself
her
mother
and
the
spanish
government
but
this
again
was
far
from
being
the
case
it
had
become
by
one
of
those
periodical
reversions
to
the
ways
of
the
eighteenth
century
which
it
is
rumoured
are
still
not
unknown
in
diplomacy
a
question
of
dominating
importance
in
the
foreign
policies
both
of
france
and
england
for
several
years
louis
philippe
and
his
prime
minister
guizot
had
been
privately
maturing
a
very
subtle
plan
it
was
the
object
of
the
french
king
to
repeat
the
glorious
coup
of
louis
xiv
and
to
abolish
the
pyrenees
by
placing
one
of
his
grandsons
on
the
throne
of
spain
in
order
to
bring
this
about
he
did
not
venture
to
suggest
that
his
younger
son
the
duc
de
montpensier
should
marry
isabella
that
would
have
been
too
obvious
a
move
which
would
have
raised
immediate
and
insurmountable
opposition
he
therefore
proposed
that
isabella
should
marry
her
cousin
the
duke
of
cadiz
while
montpensier
married
isabella
younger
sister
the
infanta
fernanda
and
pray
what
possible
objection
could
there
be
to
that
the
wily
old
king
whispered
into
the
chaste
ears
of
guizot
the
key
to
the
secret
he
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
duke
of
cadiz
was
incapable
of
having
children
and
therefore
the
offspring
of
fernanda
would
inherit
the
spanish
crown
guizot
rubbed
his
hands
and
began
at
once
to
set
the
necessary
springs
in
motion
but
of
course
the
whole
scheme
was
very
soon
divulged
and
understood
the
english
government
took
an
extremely
serious
view
of
the
matter
the
balance
of
power
was
clearly
at
stake
and
the
french
intrigue
must
be
frustrated
at
all
hazards
a
diplomatic
struggle
of
great
intensity
followed
and
it
occasionally
appeared
that
a
second
war
of
the
spanish
succession
was
about
to
break
out
this
was
avoided
but
the
consequences
of
this
strange
imbroglio
were
and
completely
different
from
what
any
of
the
parties
concerned
could
have
guessed
in
the
course
of
the
long
and
intricate
negotiations
there
was
one
point
upon
which
louis
philippe
laid
a
special
stress
the
candidature
of
prince
leopold
of
the
prospect
of
a
marriage
between
a
coburg
prince
and
the
queen
of
spain
was
he
declared
at
least
as
threatening
to
the
balance
of
power
in
europe
as
that
of
a
marriage
between
the
duc
de
montpensier
and
the
infanta
and
indeed
there
was
much
to
be
said
for
this
contention
the
ruin
which
had
fallen
upon
the
house
of
coburg
during
the
napoleonic
wars
had
apparently
only
served
to
multiply
its
vitality
for
that
princely
family
had
by
now
extended
itself
over
europe
in
an
extraordinary
manner
king
leopold
was
firmly
fixed
in
belgium
his
niece
was
queen
of
england
one
of
his
nephews
was
the
husband
of
the
queen
of
england
and
another
the
husband
of
the
queen
of
portugal
yet
another
was
duke
of
wurtemberg
where
was
this
to
end
there
seemed
to
be
a
coburg
trust
ready
to
send
out
one
of
its
members
at
any
moment
to
fill
up
any
vacant
place
among
the
ruling
families
of
europe
and
even
beyond
europe
there
were
signs
of
this
infection
spreading
an
american
who
had
arrived
in
brussels
had
assured
king
leopold
that
there
was
a
strong
feeling
in
the
united
states
in
favour
of
monarchy
instead
of
the
misrule
of
mobs
and
had
suggested
to
the
delight
of
his
majesty
that
some
branch
of
the
coburg
family
might
be
available
for
the
position
that
danger
might
perhaps
be
remote
but
the
spanish
danger
was
close
at
hand
and
if
prince
leopold
were
to
marry
queen
isabella
the
position
of
france
would
be
one
of
humiliation
if
not
of
positive
danger
such
were
the
asseverations
of
louis
philippe
the
english
government
had
no
wish
to
support
prince
leopold
and
though
albert
and
victoria
had
some
hankerings
for
the
match
the
wisdom
of
stockmar
had
induced
them
to
give
up
all
thoughts
of
it
the
way
thus
seemed
open
for
a
settlement
england
would
be
reasonable
about
leopold
if
france
would
be
reasonable
about
montpensier
at
the
chateau
the
agreement
was
made
in
a
series
of
conversations
between
the
king
and
guizot
on
the
one
side
and
the
queen
the
prince
and
lord
aberdeen
on
the
other
aberdeen
as
foreign
minister
declared
that
england
would
neither
recognise
nor
support
prince
leopold
as
a
candidate
for
the
hand
of
the
queen
of
spain
while
louis
philippe
solemnly
promised
both
to
aberdeen
and
to
victoria
that
the
duc
de
montpensier
should
not
marry
the
infanta
fernanda
until
after
the
queen
was
married
and
had
issue
all
went
well
and
the
crisis
seemed
to
be
over
when
the
whole
question
was
suddenly
by
palmerston
who
had
succeeded
aberdeen
at
the
foreign
office
in
a
despatch
to
the
english
minister
at
madrid
he
mentioned
in
a
list
of
possible
candidates
for
queen
isabella
hand
prince
leopold
of
coburg
and
at
the
same
time
he
took
occasion
to
denounce
in
violent
language
the
tyranny
and
incompetence
of
the
spanish
government
this
despatch
indiscreet
in
any
case
was
rendered
infinitely
more
so
by
being
communicated
to
guizot
louis
philippe
saw
his
opportunity
and
pounced
on
it
though
there
was
nothing
in
palmerston
language
to
show
that
he
either
recognised
or
supported
prince
leopold
the
king
at
once
assumed
that
the
english
had
broken
their
engagement
and
that
he
was
therefore
free
to
do
likewise
he
then
sent
the
despatch
to
the
queen
mother
declared
that
the
english
were
intriguing
for
the
coburg
marriage
bade
her
mark
the
animosity
of
palmerston
against
the
spanish
government
and
urged
her
to
escape
from
her
difficulties
and
ensure
the
friendship
of
france
by
marrying
isabella
to
the
duke
of
cadiz
and
fernanda
to
montpensier
the
queen
mother
alarmed
and
furious
was
easily
convinced
there
was
only
one
difficulty
isabella
loathed
the
very
sight
of
her
cousin
but
this
was
soon
surmounted
there
was
a
wild
at
the
palace
and
in
the
course
of
it
the
young
girl
was
induced
to
consent
to
anything
that
was
asked
of
her
shortly
after
and
on
the
same
day
both
the
marriages
took
place
the
news
burst
like
a
bomb
on
the
english
government
who
saw
with
rage
and
mortification
that
they
had
been
completely
outmanoeuvred
by
the
crafty
king
victoria
in
particular
was
outraged
not
only
had
she
been
the
personal
recipient
of
louis
philippe
pledge
but
he
had
won
his
way
to
her
heart
by
presenting
the
prince
of
wales
with
a
box
of
soldiers
and
sending
the
princess
royal
a
beautiful
parisian
doll
with
eyes
that
opened
and
shut
and
now
insult
was
added
to
injury
the
queen
of
the
french
wrote
her
a
formal
letter
calmly
announcing
as
a
family
event
in
which
she
was
sure
victoria
would
be
interested
the
marriage
of
her
son
montpensier
qui
ajoutera
a
notre
bonheur
interieur
le
seul
vrai
dans
ce
monde
et
que
vous
madame
savez
si
bien
apprecier
but
the
english
queen
had
not
long
to
wait
for
her
revenge
within
eighteen
months
the
monarchy
of
louis
philippe
discredited
unpopular
and
fatally
weakened
by
the
withdrawal
of
english
support
was
swept
into
limbo
while
he
and
his
family
threw
themselves
as
suppliant
fugitives
at
the
feet
of
victoria
ii
in
this
affair
both
the
queen
and
the
prince
had
been
too
much
occupied
with
the
delinquencies
of
louis
philippe
to
have
any
wrath
to
spare
for
those
of
palmerston
and
indeed
on
the
main
issue
attitude
and
their
own
had
been
in
complete
agreement
but
in
this
the
case
was
unique
in
every
other
foreign
complication
and
they
were
many
and
serious
during
the
ensuing
years
the
differences
between
the
royal
couple
and
the
foreign
secretary
were
constant
and
profound
there
was
a
sharp
quarrel
over
portugal
where
violently
hostile
parties
were
flying
at
each
other
throats
the
royal
sympathy
was
naturally
enlisted
on
behalf
of
the
queen
and
her
coburg
husband
while
palmerston
gave
his
support
to
the
progressive
elements
in
the
country
it
was
not
until
however
that
the
strain
became
really
serious
in
that
year
of
revolutions
when
in
all
directions
and
with
alarming
frequency
crowns
kept
rolling
off
royal
heads
albert
and
victoria
were
appalled
to
find
that
the
policy
of
england
was
persistently
directed
in
germany
in
switzerland
in
austria
in
italy
in
sicily
so
as
to
favour
the
insurgent
forces
the
situation
indeed
was
just
such
a
one
as
the
soul
of
palmerston
loved
there
was
danger
and
excitement
the
necessity
of
decision
the
opportunity
for
action
on
every
hand
a
disciple
of
canning
with
an
english
gentleman
contempt
and
dislike
of
foreign
potentates
deep
in
his
heart
the
spectacle
of
the
popular
uprisings
and
of
the
oppressors
bundled
ignominiously
out
of
the
palaces
they
had
disgraced
gave
him
unbounded
pleasure
and
he
was
determined
that
there
should
be
no
doubt
whatever
all
over
the
continent
on
which
side
in
the
great
struggle
england
stood
it
was
not
that
he
had
the
slightest
tincture
in
him
of
philosophical
radicalism
he
had
no
philosophical
tinctures
of
any
kind
he
was
quite
content
to
be
inconsistent
to
be
a
conservative
at
home
and
a
liberal
abroad
there
were
very
good
reasons
for
keeping
the
irish
in
their
places
but
what
had
that
to
do
with
it
the
point
was
this
when
any
decent
man
read
an
account
of
the
political
prisons
in
naples
his
gorge
rose
he
did
not
want
war
but
he
saw
that
without
war
a
skilful
and
determined
use
of
england
power
might
do
much
to
further
the
cause
of
the
liberals
in
europe
it
was
a
difficult
and
a
hazardous
game
to
play
but
he
set
about
playing
it
with
delighted
alacrity
and
then
to
his
intense
annoyance
just
as
he
needed
all
his
nerve
and
all
possible
freedom
of
action
he
found
himself
being
hampered
and
distracted
at
every
turn
by
those
people
at
osborne
he
saw
what
it
was
the
opposition
was
systematic
and
informed
and
the
queen
alone
would
have
been
incapable
of
it
the
prince
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
thing
it
was
exceedingly
vexatious
but
palmerston
was
in
a
hurry
and
could
not
wait
the
prince
if
he
would
insist
upon
interfering
must
be
brushed
on
one
side
albert
was
very
angry
he
highly
disapproved
both
of
palmerston
policy
and
of
his
methods
of
action
he
was
opposed
to
absolutism
but
in
his
opinion
palmerston
proceedings
were
simply
calculated
to
substitute
for
absolutism
all
over
europe
something
no
better
and
very
possibly
worse
the
anarchy
of
faction
and
mob
violence
the
dangers
of
this
revolutionary
ferment
were
grave
even
in
england
chartism
was
rampant
a
sinister
movement
which
might
at
any
moment
upset
the
constitution
and
abolish
the
monarchy
surely
with
such
dangers
at
home
this
was
a
very
bad
time
to
choose
for
encouraging
lawlessness
abroad
he
naturally
took
a
particular
interest
in
germany
his
instincts
his
affections
his
prepossessions
were
ineradicably
german
stockmar
was
deeply
involved
in
german
politics
and
he
had
a
multitude
of
relatives
among
the
ruling
german
families
who
from
the
midst
of
the
of
revolution
wrote
him
long
and
agitated
letters
once
a
week
having
considered
the
question
of
germany
future
from
every
point
of
view
he
came
to
the
conclusion
under
stockmar
guidance
that
the
great
aim
for
every
lover
of
germany
should
be
her
unification
under
the
sovereignty
of
prussia
the
intricacy
of
the
situation
was
extreme
and
the
possibilities
of
good
or
evil
which
every
hour
might
bring
forth
were
incalculable
yet
he
saw
with
horror
that
palmerston
neither
understood
nor
cared
to
understand
the
niceties
of
this
momentous
problem
but
rushed
on
blindly
dealing
blows
to
right
and
left
quite
so
far
as
he
could
see
without
system
and
even
without
motive
except
indeed
a
totally
unreasonable
distrust
of
the
prussian
state
but
his
disagreement
with
the
details
of
palmerston
policy
was
in
reality
merely
a
symptom
of
the
fundamental
differences
between
the
characters
of
the
two
men
in
albert
eyes
palmerston
was
a
coarse
reckless
egotist
whose
combined
arrogance
and
ignorance
must
inevitably
have
their
issue
in
folly
and
disaster
nothing
could
be
more
antipathetic
to
him
than
a
mind
so
strangely
lacking
in
patience
in
reflection
in
principle
and
in
the
habits
of
ratiocination
for
to
him
it
was
intolerable
to
think
in
a
hurry
to
jump
to
slapdash
decisions
to
act
on
instincts
that
could
not
be
explained
everything
must
be
done
in
due
order
with
careful
premeditation
the
premises
of
the
position
must
first
be
firmly
established
and
he
must
reach
the
correct
conclusion
by
a
regular
series
of
rational
steps
in
complicated
questions
and
what
questions
rightly
looked
at
were
not
complicated
to
commit
one
thoughts
to
paper
was
the
wisest
course
and
it
was
the
course
which
albert
laborious
though
it
might
be
invariably
adopted
it
was
as
well
too
to
draw
up
a
reasoned
statement
after
an
event
as
well
as
before
it
and
accordingly
whatever
happened
it
was
always
found
that
the
prince
had
made
a
memorandum
on
one
occasion
he
reduced
to
six
pages
of
foolscap
the
substance
of
a
confidential
conversation
with
sir
robert
peel
and
having
read
them
aloud
to
him
asked
him
to
append
his
signature
sir
robert
who
never
liked
to
commit
himself
became
extremely
uneasy
upon
which
the
prince
understanding
that
it
was
necessary
to
humour
the
singular
susceptibilities
of
englishmen
with
great
tact
dropped
that
particular
memorandum
into
the
fire
but
as
for
palmerston
he
never
even
gave
one
so
much
as
a
chance
to
read
him
a
memorandum
he
positively
seemed
to
dislike
discussion
and
before
one
knew
where
one
was
without
any
warning
whatever
he
would
plunge
into
some
violent
project
which
as
likely
as
not
would
logically
involve
a
european
war
closely
connected
too
with
this
cautious
painstaking
reasonableness
of
albert
was
his
desire
to
examine
questions
thoroughly
from
every
point
of
view
to
go
down
to
the
roots
of
things
and
to
act
in
strict
accordance
with
some
principle
under
stockmar
tutelage
he
was
constantly
engaged
in
enlarging
his
outlook
and
in
endeavouring
to
envisage
vital
problems
both
theoretically
and
practically
both
with
precision
and
with
depth
to
one
whose
mind
was
thus
habitually
occupied
the
empirical
activities
of
palmerston
who
had
no
notion
what
a
principle
meant
resembled
the
incoherent
vagaries
of
a
tiresome
child
what
did
palmerston
know
of
economics
of
science
of
history
what
did
he
care
for
morality
and
education
how
much
consideration
had
he
devoted
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
to
the
improvement
of
the
condition
of
the
and
to
the
general
amelioration
of
the
human
race
the
answers
to
such
questions
were
all
too
obvious
and
yet
it
is
easy
to
imagine
also
what
might
have
been
palmerston
jaunty
comment
ah
your
royal
highness
is
busy
with
fine
schemes
and
beneficent
calculations
exactly
well
as
for
me
i
must
say
i
quite
satisfied
with
my
morning
work
i
had
the
iron
hurdles
taken
out
of
the
green
park
the
exasperating
man
however
preferred
to
make
no
comment
and
to
proceed
in
smiling
silence
on
his
inexcusable
way
the
process
of
brushing
on
one
side
very
soon
came
into
operation
important
foreign
office
despatches
were
either
submitted
to
the
queen
so
late
that
there
was
no
time
to
correct
them
or
they
were
not
submitted
to
her
at
all
or
having
been
submitted
and
some
passage
in
them
being
objected
to
and
an
alteration
suggested
they
were
after
all
sent
off
in
their
original
form
the
queen
complained
the
prince
complained
both
complained
together
it
was
quite
useless
palmerston
was
most
apologetic
could
not
understand
how
it
had
occurred
must
give
the
clerks
a
wigging
certainly
her
majesty
wishes
should
be
attended
to
and
such
a
thing
should
never
happen
again
but
of
course
it
very
soon
happened
again
and
the
royal
remonstrances
redoubled
victoria
her
partisan
passions
thoroughly
aroused
imported
into
her
protests
a
personal
vehemence
which
those
of
albert
lacked
did
lord
palmerston
forget
that
she
was
queen
of
england
how
could
she
tolerate
a
state
of
affairs
in
which
despatches
written
in
her
name
were
sent
abroad
without
her
approval
or
even
her
knowledge
what
could
be
more
derogatory
to
her
position
than
to
be
obliged
to
receive
indignant
letters
from
the
crowned
heads
to
whom
those
despatches
were
addressed
letters
which
she
did
not
know
how
to
answer
since
she
so
thoroughly
agreed
with
them
she
addressed
herself
to
the
prime
minister
no
remonstrance
has
any
effect
with
lord
palmerston
she
said
lord
palmerston
she
told
him
on
another
occasion
has
as
usual
pretended
not
to
have
had
time
to
submit
the
draft
to
the
queen
before
he
had
sent
it
off
she
summoned
lord
john
to
her
presence
poured
out
her
indignation
and
afterwards
on
the
advice
of
albert
noted
down
what
had
passed
in
a
memorandum
i
said
that
i
thought
that
lord
palmerston
often
endangered
the
honour
of
england
by
taking
a
very
prejudiced
and
view
of
a
question
that
his
writings
were
always
as
bitter
as
gall
and
did
great
harm
which
lord
john
entirely
assented
to
and
that
i
often
felt
quite
ill
from
anxiety
then
she
turned
to
her
uncle
the
state
of
germany
she
wrote
in
a
comprehensive
and
despairing
review
of
the
european
situation
is
dreadful
and
one
does
feel
quite
ashamed
about
that
once
really
so
peaceful
and
happy
country
that
there
are
still
good
people
there
i
am
sure
but
they
allow
themselves
to
be
worked
upon
in
a
frightful
and
shameful
way
in
france
a
crisis
seems
at
hand
what
a
very
bad
figure
we
cut
in
this
mediation
really
it
is
quite
immoral
with
ireland
quivering
in
our
grasp
and
ready
to
throw
off
her
allegiance
at
any
moment
for
us
to
force
austria
to
give
up
her
lawful
possessions
what
shall
we
say
if
canada
malta
begin
to
trouble
us
it
hurts
me
terribly
but
what
did
lord
palmerston
care
lord
john
position
grew
more
and
more
irksome
he
did
not
approve
of
his
colleague
treatment
of
the
queen
when
he
begged
him
to
be
more
careful
he
was
met
with
the
reply
that
despatches
passed
through
the
foreign
office
in
a
single
year
that
if
every
one
of
these
were
to
be
subjected
to
the
royal
criticism
the
delay
would
be
most
serious
that
as
it
was
the
waste
of
time
and
the
worry
involved
in
submitting
drafts
to
the
meticulous
examination
of
prince
albert
was
almost
too
much
for
an
overworked
minister
and
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
postponement
of
important
decisions
owing
to
this
cause
had
already
produced
very
unpleasant
diplomatic
consequences
these
excuses
would
have
impressed
lord
john
more
favourably
if
he
had
not
himself
had
to
suffer
from
a
similar
neglect
as
often
as
not
palmerston
failed
to
communicate
even
to
him
the
most
important
despatches
the
foreign
secretary
was
becoming
an
almost
independent
power
acting
on
his
own
initiative
and
swaying
the
policy
of
england
on
his
own
responsibility
on
one
occasion
in
he
had
actually
been
upon
the
point
of
threatening
to
break
off
diplomatic
relations
with
france
without
consulting
either
the
cabinet
or
the
prime
minister
and
such
incidents
were
constantly
recurring
when
this
became
known
to
the
prince
he
saw
that
his
opportunity
had
come
if
he
could
only
drive
in
to
the
utmost
the
wedge
between
the
two
statesmen
if
he
could
only
secure
the
alliance
of
lord
john
then
the
suppression
or
the
removal
of
lord
palmerston
would
be
almost
certain
to
follow
he
set
about
the
business
with
all
the
pertinacity
of
his
nature
both
he
and
the
queen
put
every
kind
of
pressure
upon
the
prime
minister
they
wrote
they
harangued
they
relapsed
into
awful
silence
it
occurred
to
them
that
lord
clarendon
an
important
member
of
the
cabinet
would
be
a
useful
channel
for
their
griefs
they
commanded
him
to
dine
at
the
palace
and
directly
the
meal
was
over
the
queen
as
he
described
it
afterwards
exploded
and
went
with
the
utmost
vehemence
and
bitterness
into
the
whole
of
palmerston
conduct
all
the
effects
produced
all
over
the
world
and
all
her
own
feelings
and
sentiments
about
it
when
she
had
finished
the
prince
took
up
the
tale
with
less
excitement
but
with
equal
force
lord
clarendon
found
himself
in
an
awkward
situation
he
disliked
palmerston
policy
but
he
was
his
colleague
and
he
disapproved
of
the
attitude
of
his
royal
hosts
in
his
opinion
they
were
wrong
in
wishing
that
courtiers
rather
than
ministers
should
conduct
the
affairs
of
the
country
and
he
thought
that
they
laboured
under
the
curious
mistake
that
the
foreign
office
was
their
peculiar
department
and
that
they
had
the
right
to
control
if
not
to
direct
the
foreign
policy
of
england
he
therefore
with
extreme
politeness
gave
it
to
be
understood
that
he
would
not
commit
himself
in
any
way
but
lord
john
in
reality
needed
no
pressure
attacked
by
his
sovereign
ignored
by
his
foreign
secretary
he
led
a
miserable
life
with
the
advent
of
the
dreadful
question
the
most
complex
in
the
whole
diplomatic
history
of
europe
his
position
crushed
between
the
upper
and
the
nether
grew
positively
unbearable
he
became
anxious
above
all
things
to
get
palmerston
out
of
the
foreign
office
but
then
supposing
palmerston
refused
to
go
in
a
memorandum
made
by
the
prince
at
about
this
time
of
an
interview
between
himself
the
queen
and
the
prime
minister
we
catch
a
curious
glimpse
of
the
states
of
mind
of
those
three
high
personages
the
anxiety
and
irritation
of
lord
john
the
vehement
acrimony
of
victoria
and
the
reasonable
animosity
of
albert
drawn
together
as
it
were
under
the
shadow
of
an
unseen
presence
the
cause
of
that
celestial
anger
the
gay
portentous
palmerston
at
one
point
in
the
conversation
lord
john
observed
that
he
believed
the
foreign
secretary
would
consent
to
a
change
of
offices
lord
palmerston
he
said
realised
that
he
had
lost
the
queen
confidence
though
only
on
public
and
not
on
personal
grounds
but
on
that
the
prince
noted
the
queen
interrupted
lord
john
by
remarking
that
she
distrusted
him
on
personal
grounds
also
but
i
remarked
that
lord
palmerston
had
so
far
at
least
seen
rightly
that
he
had
become
disagreeable
to
the
queen
not
on
account
of
his
person
but
of
his
political
doings
to
which
the
queen
assented
then
the
prince
suggested
that
there
was
a
danger
of
the
cabinet
breaking
up
and
of
lord
palmerston
returning
to
office
as
prime
minister
but
on
that
point
lord
john
was
reassuring
he
thought
lord
palmerston
too
old
to
do
much
in
the
future
having
passed
his
year
eventually
it
was
decided
that
nothing
could
be
done
for
the
present
but
that
the
utmost
secrecy
must
be
observed
and
so
the
conclave
ended
at
last
in
deliverance
seemed
to
be
at
hand
there
were
signs
that
the
public
were
growing
weary
of
the
alarums
and
excursions
of
palmerston
diplomacy
and
when
his
support
of
don
pacifico
a
british
subject
in
a
quarrel
with
the
greek
government
seemed
to
be
upon
the
point
of
involving
the
country
in
a
war
not
only
with
greece
but
also
with
france
and
possibly
with
russia
into
the
bargain
a
heavy
cloud
of
distrust
and
displeasure
appeared
to
be
gathering
and
about
to
burst
over
his
head
a
motion
directed
against
him
in
the
house
of
lords
was
passed
by
a
substantial
majority
the
question
was
next
to
be
discussed
in
the
house
of
commons
where
another
adverse
vote
was
not
improbable
and
would
seal
the
doom
of
the
minister
palmerston
received
the
attack
with
complete
nonchalance
and
then
at
the
last
possible
moment
he
struck
in
a
speech
of
over
four
hours
in
which
exposition
invective
argument
declamation
plain
talk
and
resounding
eloquence
were
mingled
together
with
consummate
art
and
extraordinary
felicity
he
annihilated
his
enemies
the
hostile
motion
was
defeated
and
palmerston
was
once
more
the
hero
of
the
hour
simultaneously
atropos
herself
conspired
to
favour
him
sir
robert
peel
was
thrown
from
his
horse
and
killed
by
this
tragic
chance
palmerston
saw
the
one
rival
great
enough
to
cope
with
him
removed
from
his
path
he
judged
and
judged
rightly
that
he
was
the
most
popular
man
in
england
and
when
lord
john
revived
the
project
of
his
exchanging
the
foreign
office
for
some
other
position
in
the
cabinet
he
absolutely
refused
to
stir
great
was
the
disappointment
of
albert
great
was
the
indignation
of
victoria
the
house
of
commons
she
wrote
is
becoming
very
unmanageable
and
troublesome
the
prince
perceiving
that
palmerston
was
more
firmly
fixed
in
the
saddle
than
ever
decided
that
something
drastic
must
be
done
five
months
before
the
prescient
baron
had
drawn
up
in
case
of
emergency
a
memorandum
which
had
been
carefully
docketed
and
placed
in
a
ready
to
hand
the
emergency
had
now
arisen
and
the
memorandum
must
be
used
the
queen
copied
out
the
words
of
stockmar
and
sent
them
to
the
prime
minister
requesting
him
to
show
her
letter
to
palmerston
she
thinks
it
right
she
wrote
in
order
to
prevent
any
mistake
for
the
future
shortly
to
explain
what
it
is
she
expects
from
her
foreign
secretary
she
requires
that
he
will
distinctly
state
what
he
proposes
in
a
given
case
in
order
that
the
queen
may
know
as
distinctly
to
what
she
has
given
her
royal
sanction
having
once
given
her
sanction
to
a
measure
that
it
be
not
arbitrarily
altered
or
modified
by
the
minister
such
an
act
she
must
consider
as
failing
in
sincerity
towards
the
crown
and
justly
to
be
visited
by
the
exercise
of
her
constitutional
right
of
dismissing
that
minister
lord
john
russell
did
as
he
was
bid
and
forwarded
the
queen
letter
to
lord
palmerston
this
transaction
which
was
of
grave
constitutional
significance
was
entirely
unknown
to
the
outside
world
if
palmerston
had
been
a
sensitive
man
he
would
probably
have
resigned
on
the
receipt
of
the
queen
missive
but
he
was
far
from
sensitive
he
loved
power
and
his
power
was
greater
than
ever
an
unerring
instinct
told
him
that
this
was
not
the
time
to
go
nevertheless
he
was
seriously
perturbed
he
understood
at
last
that
he
was
struggling
with
a
formidable
adversary
whose
skill
and
strength
unless
they
were
mollified
might
do
irreparable
injury
to
his
career
he
therefore
wrote
to
lord
john
briefly
acquiescing
in
the
queen
requirements
i
have
taken
a
copy
of
this
memorandum
of
the
queen
and
will
not
fail
to
attend
to
the
directions
which
it
contains
and
at
the
same
time
he
asked
for
an
interview
with
the
prince
albert
at
once
summoned
him
to
the
palace
and
was
astonished
to
observe
as
he
noted
in
a
memorandum
that
when
palmerston
entered
the
room
he
was
very
much
agitated
shook
and
had
tears
in
his
eyes
so
as
quite
to
move
me
who
never
under
any
circumstances
had
known
him
otherwise
than
with
a
bland
smile
on
his
face
the
old
statesman
was
profuse
in
protestations
and
excuses
the
young
one
was
coldly
polite
at
last
after
a
long
and
inconclusive
conversation
the
prince
drawing
himself
up
said
that
in
order
to
give
lord
palmerston
an
example
of
what
the
queen
wanted
he
would
ask
him
a
question
lord
palmerston
waited
in
respectful
silence
while
the
prince
proceeded
as
follows
you
are
aware
that
the
queen
has
objected
to
the
protocol
about
schleswig
and
of
the
grounds
on
which
she
has
done
so
her
opinion
has
been
overruled
the
protocol
stating
the
desire
of
the
great
powers
to
see
the
integrity
of
the
danish
monarchy
preserved
has
been
signed
and
upon
this
the
king
of
denmark
has
invaded
schleswig
where
the
war
is
raging
if
holstein
is
attacked
also
which
is
likely
the
germans
will
not
be
restrained
from
flying
to
her
assistance
russia
has
menaced
to
interfere
with
arms
if
the
schleswigers
are
successful
what
will
you
do
if
this
emergency
arises
provoking
most
likely
an
european
war
and
which
will
arise
very
probably
when
we
shall
be
at
balmoral
and
lord
john
in
another
part
of
scotland
the
queen
expects
from
your
foresight
that
you
have
contemplated
this
possibility
and
requires
a
categorical
answer
as
to
what
you
would
do
in
the
event
supposed
strangely
enough
to
this
pointblank
question
the
foreign
secretary
appeared
to
be
unable
to
reply
the
whole
matter
he
said
was
extremely
complicated
and
the
contingencies
mentioned
by
his
royal
highness
were
very
unlikely
to
arise
the
prince
persisted
but
it
was
useless
for
a
full
hour
he
struggled
to
extract
a
categorical
answer
until
at
length
palmerston
bowed
himself
out
of
the
room
albert
threw
up
his
hands
in
shocked
amazement
what
could
one
do
with
such
a
man
what
indeed
for
in
spite
of
all
his
apologies
and
all
his
promises
within
a
few
weeks
the
incorrigible
reprobate
was
at
his
tricks
again
the
austrian
general
haynau
notorious
as
a
rigorous
suppressor
of
rebellion
in
hungary
and
italy
and
in
particular
as
a
flogger
of
women
came
to
england
and
took
it
into
his
head
to
pay
a
visit
to
barclay
and
perkins
brewery
the
features
of
general
hyena
as
he
was
everywhere
called
his
grim
thin
face
his
enormous
moustaches
had
gained
a
horrid
celebrity
and
it
so
happened
that
among
the
clerks
at
the
brewery
there
was
a
refugee
from
vienna
who
had
given
his
a
account
of
the
characteristics
the
austrian
ambassador
scenting
danger
begged
his
friend
not
to
appear
in
public
or
if
he
must
do
so
to
cut
off
his
moustaches
first
but
the
general
would
take
no
advice
he
went
to
the
brewery
was
immediately
recognised
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
angry
draymen
pushed
about
shouted
at
punched
in
the
ribs
and
pulled
by
the
moustaches
until
bolting
down
an
alley
with
the
mob
at
his
heels
brandishing
brooms
and
roaring
hyena
he
managed
to
take
refuge
in
a
public
house
whence
he
was
removed
under
the
protection
of
several
policemen
the
austrian
government
was
angry
and
demanded
explanations
palmerston
who
of
course
was
privately
delighted
by
the
incident
replied
regretting
what
had
occurred
but
adding
that
in
his
opinion
the
general
had
evinced
a
want
of
propriety
in
coming
to
england
at
the
present
moment
and
he
delivered
his
note
to
the
ambassador
without
having
previously
submitted
it
to
the
queen
or
to
the
prime
minister
naturally
when
this
was
discovered
there
was
a
serious
storm
the
prince
was
especially
indignant
the
conduct
of
the
draymen
he
regarded
with
disgust
and
alarm
as
a
slight
foretaste
of
what
an
unregulated
mass
of
illiterate
people
is
capable
and
palmerston
was
requested
by
lord
john
to
withdraw
his
note
and
to
substitute
for
it
another
from
which
all
censure
of
the
general
had
been
omitted
on
this
the
foreign
secretary
threatened
resignation
but
the
prime
minister
was
firm
for
a
moment
the
royal
hopes
rose
high
only
to
be
dashed
to
the
ground
again
by
the
cruel
compliance
of
the
enemy
palmerston
suddenly
lamblike
agreed
to
everything
the
note
was
withdrawn
and
altered
and
peace
was
patched
up
once
more
it
lasted
for
a
year
and
then
in
october
the
arrival
of
kossuth
in
england
brought
on
another
crisis
palmerston
desire
to
receive
the
hungarian
patriot
at
his
house
in
london
was
vetoed
by
lord
john
once
more
there
was
a
sharp
struggle
once
more
palmerston
after
threatening
resignation
yielded
but
still
the
insubordinate
man
could
not
keep
quiet
a
few
weeks
later
a
deputation
of
radicals
from
finsbury
and
islington
waited
on
him
at
the
foreign
office
and
presented
him
with
an
address
in
which
the
emperors
of
austria
and
russia
were
stigmatised
as
odious
and
detestable
assassins
and
merciless
tyrants
and
despots
the
foreign
secretary
in
his
reply
while
mildly
deprecating
these
expressions
allowed
his
real
sentiments
to
appear
with
a
most
undiplomatic
insouciance
there
was
an
immediate
scandal
and
the
court
flowed
over
with
rage
and
vituperation
i
think
said
the
baron
the
man
has
been
for
some
time
insane
victoria
in
an
agitated
letter
urged
lord
john
to
assert
his
authority
but
lord
john
perceived
that
on
this
matter
the
foreign
secretary
had
the
support
of
public
opinion
and
he
judged
it
wiser
to
bide
his
time
he
had
not
long
to
wait
the
culmination
of
the
long
series
of
conflicts
threats
and
exacerbations
came
before
the
year
was
out
on
december
louis
napoleon
coup
took
place
in
paris
and
on
the
following
day
palmerston
without
consulting
anybody
expressed
in
a
conversation
with
the
french
ambassador
his
approval
of
napoleon
act
two
days
later
he
was
instructed
by
the
prime
minister
in
accordance
with
a
letter
from
the
queen
that
it
was
the
policy
of
the
english
government
to
maintain
an
attitude
of
strict
neutrality
towards
the
affairs
of
france
nevertheless
in
an
official
despatch
to
the
british
ambassador
in
paris
he
repeated
the
approval
of
the
coup
which
he
had
already
given
verbally
to
the
french
ambassador
in
london
this
despatch
was
submitted
neither
to
the
queen
nor
to
the
prime
minister
lord
john
patience
as
he
himself
said
was
drained
to
the
last
drop
he
dismissed
lord
palmerston
victoria
was
in
ecstasies
and
albert
knew
that
the
triumph
was
his
even
more
than
lord
john
it
was
his
wish
that
lord
granville
a
young
man
whom
he
believed
to
be
pliant
to
his
influence
should
be
successor
and
lord
granville
was
appointed
henceforward
it
seemed
that
the
prince
would
have
his
way
in
foreign
affairs
after
years
of
struggle
and
mortification
success
greeted
him
on
every
hand
in
his
family
he
was
an
adored
master
in
the
country
the
great
exhibition
had
brought
him
respect
and
glory
and
now
in
the
secret
seats
of
power
he
had
gained
a
new
supremacy
he
had
wrestled
with
the
terrible
lord
palmerston
the
embodiment
of
all
that
was
most
hostile
to
him
in
the
spirit
of
england
and
his
redoubtable
opponent
had
been
overthrown
was
england
herself
at
his
feet
it
might
be
so
and
yet
it
is
said
that
the
sons
of
england
have
a
certain
tiresome
quality
they
never
know
when
they
are
beaten
it
was
odd
but
palmerston
was
positively
still
jaunty
was
it
possible
could
he
believe
in
his
blind
arrogance
that
even
his
ignominious
dismissal
from
office
was
something
that
could
be
brushed
aside
iii
the
prince
triumph
was
a
few
weeks
later
owing
to
palmerston
influence
the
government
was
defeated
in
the
house
and
lord
john
resigned
then
after
a
short
interval
a
coalition
between
the
whigs
and
the
followers
of
peel
came
into
power
under
the
premiership
of
lord
aberdeen
once
more
palmerston
was
in
the
cabinet
it
was
true
that
he
did
not
return
to
the
foreign
office
that
was
something
to
the
good
in
the
home
department
it
might
be
hoped
that
his
activities
would
be
less
dangerous
and
disagreeable
but
the
foreign
secretary
was
no
longer
the
complacent
granville
and
in
lord
clarendon
the
prince
knew
that
he
had
a
minister
to
deal
with
who
discreet
and
courteous
as
he
was
had
a
mind
of
his
own
these
changes
however
were
merely
the
preliminaries
of
a
far
more
serious
development
events
on
every
side
were
moving
towards
a
catastrophe
suddenly
the
nation
found
itself
under
the
awful
shadow
of
imminent
war
for
several
months
amid
the
shifting
mysteries
of
diplomacy
and
the
perplexed
agitations
of
politics
the
issue
grew
more
doubtful
and
more
dark
while
the
national
temper
was
strained
to
the
at
the
very
crisis
of
the
long
and
ominous
negotiations
it
was
announced
that
lord
palmerston
had
resigned
then
the
fury
of
the
people
burst
forth
they
had
felt
that
in
the
terrible
complexity
of
events
they
were
being
guided
by
weak
and
embarrassed
counsels
but
they
had
been
reassured
by
the
knowledge
that
at
the
centre
of
power
there
was
one
man
with
strength
with
courage
with
determination
in
whom
they
could
put
their
trust
they
now
learnt
that
that
man
was
no
longer
among
their
leaders
why
in
their
rage
anxiety
and
nervous
exhaustion
they
looked
round
desperately
for
some
hidden
and
horrible
explanation
of
what
had
occurred
they
suspected
plots
they
smelt
treachery
in
the
air
it
was
easy
to
guess
the
object
upon
which
their
frenzy
would
vent
itself
was
there
not
a
foreigner
in
the
highest
of
high
places
a
foreigner
whose
hostility
to
their
own
adored
champion
was
unrelenting
and
unconcealed
the
moment
that
palmerston
resignation
was
known
there
was
a
universal
outcry
and
an
extraordinary
tempest
of
anger
and
hatred
burst
with
unparalleled
violence
upon
the
head
of
the
prince
it
was
everywhere
asserted
and
believed
that
the
queen
husband
was
a
traitor
to
the
country
that
he
was
a
tool
of
the
russian
court
that
in
obedience
to
russian
influences
he
had
forced
palmerston
out
of
the
government
and
that
he
was
directing
the
foreign
policy
of
england
in
the
interests
of
england
enemies
for
many
weeks
these
accusations
filled
the
whole
of
the
press
repeated
at
public
meetings
elaborated
in
private
talk
they
flew
over
the
country
growing
every
moment
more
extreme
and
more
improbable
while
respectable
newspapers
thundered
out
their
grave
invectives
halfpenny
broadsides
hawked
through
the
streets
of
london
in
doggerel
vulgarity
the
same
sentiments
and
the
same
suspicions
at
last
the
wildest
rumours
began
to
spread
the
turkish
war
both
far
and
near
has
played
the
very
deuce
then
and
little
al
the
royal
pal
they
say
has
turned
a
russian
old
aberdeen
as
may
be
seen
looks
woeful
pale
and
yellow
and
old
john
bull
had
his
belly
full
of
dirty
russian
tallow
chorus
we
send
him
home
and
make
him
groan
oh
al
you
played
the
deuce
then
the
german
lad
has
acted
sad
and
turned
tail
with
the
russians
last
monday
night
all
in
a
fright
al
out
of
bed
did
tumble
the
german
lad
was
raving
mad
how
he
did
groan
and
grumble
he
cried
to
vic
cut
my
stick
to
petersburg
go
right
slap
when
vic
is
said
jumped
out
of
bed
and
wopped
him
with
her
from
lovely
albert
a
broadside
preserved
at
the
british
museum
in
january
it
was
whispered
that
the
prince
had
been
seized
that
he
had
been
found
guilty
of
high
treason
that
he
was
to
be
committed
to
the
tower
the
queen
herself
some
declared
had
been
arrested
and
large
crowds
actually
collected
round
the
tower
to
watch
the
incarceration
of
the
royal
miscreants
you
jolly
turks
now
go
to
work
and
show
the
bear
your
power
it
is
rumoured
over
britain
isle
that
a
is
in
the
tower
the
postmen
some
suspicion
had
and
opened
the
two
letters
was
a
pity
sad
the
german
lad
should
not
have
known
much
better
lovely
albert
these
fantastic
hallucinations
the
result
of
the
fevered
atmosphere
of
approaching
war
were
devoid
of
any
basis
in
actual
fact
resignation
had
been
in
all
probability
totally
disconnected
with
foreign
policy
it
had
certainly
been
entirely
spontaneous
and
had
surprised
the
court
as
much
as
the
nation
nor
had
albert
influence
been
used
in
any
way
to
favour
the
interests
of
russia
as
often
happens
in
such
cases
the
government
had
been
swinging
backwards
and
forwards
between
two
incompatible
policies
that
of
and
that
of
threats
supported
by
force
either
of
which
if
consistently
followed
might
well
have
had
a
successful
and
peaceful
issue
but
which
mingled
together
could
only
lead
to
war
albert
with
characteristic
scrupulosity
attempted
to
thread
his
way
through
the
complicated
labyrinth
of
european
diplomacy
and
eventually
was
lost
in
the
maze
but
so
was
the
whole
of
the
cabinet
and
when
war
came
his
feelings
were
quite
as
vehement
as
those
of
the
most
bellicose
of
englishmen
nevertheless
though
the
specific
charges
levelled
against
the
prince
were
without
foundation
there
were
underlying
elements
in
the
situation
which
explained
if
they
did
not
justify
the
popular
state
of
mind
it
was
true
that
the
queen
husband
was
a
foreigner
who
had
been
brought
up
in
a
foreign
court
was
impregnated
with
foreign
ideas
and
was
closely
related
to
a
multitude
of
foreign
princes
clearly
this
though
perhaps
an
unavoidable
was
an
undesirable
state
of
affairs
nor
were
the
objections
to
it
merely
theoretical
it
had
in
fact
produced
unpleasant
consequences
of
a
serious
kind
the
prince
german
proclivities
were
perpetually
lamented
by
english
ministers
lord
palmerston
lord
clarendon
lord
aberdeen
all
told
the
same
tale
and
it
was
constantly
necessary
in
grave
questions
of
national
policy
to
combat
the
prepossessions
of
a
court
in
which
german
views
and
german
sentiments
held
a
disproportionate
place
as
for
palmerston
his
language
on
this
topic
was
apt
to
be
unbridled
at
the
height
of
his
annoyance
over
his
resignation
he
roundly
declared
that
he
had
been
made
a
victim
to
foreign
intrigue
he
afterwards
toned
down
this
accusation
but
the
mere
fact
that
such
a
suggestion
from
such
a
quarter
was
possible
at
all
showed
to
what
unfortunate
consequences
foreign
birth
and
foreign
upbringing
might
lead
but
this
was
not
all
a
constitutional
question
of
the
most
profound
importance
was
raised
by
the
position
of
the
prince
in
england
his
presence
gave
a
new
prominence
to
an
old
problem
the
precise
definition
of
the
functions
and
the
powers
of
the
crown
those
functions
and
powers
had
become
in
effect
his
and
what
sort
of
use
was
he
making
of
them
his
views
as
to
the
place
of
the
crown
in
the
constitution
are
easily
ascertainable
for
they
were
stockmar
and
it
happens
that
we
possess
a
detailed
account
of
stockmar
opinions
upon
the
subject
in
a
long
letter
addressed
by
him
to
the
prince
at
the
time
of
this
very
crisis
just
before
the
outbreak
of
the
crimean
war
constitutional
monarchy
according
to
the
baron
had
suffered
an
eclipse
since
the
passing
of
the
reform
bill
it
was
now
constantly
in
danger
of
becoming
a
pure
ministerial
government
the
old
race
of
tories
who
had
a
direct
interest
in
upholding
the
prerogatives
of
the
crown
had
died
out
and
the
whigs
were
nothing
but
partly
conscious
partly
unconscious
republicans
who
stand
in
the
same
relation
to
the
throne
as
the
wolf
does
to
the
lamb
there
was
a
rule
that
it
was
unconstitutional
to
introduce
the
name
and
person
of
the
irresponsible
sovereign
into
parliamentary
debates
on
constitutional
matters
this
was
a
constitutional
fiction
which
although
undoubtedly
of
old
standing
was
fraught
with
danger
and
the
baron
warned
the
prince
that
if
the
english
crown
permit
a
whig
ministry
to
follow
this
rule
in
practice
without
exception
you
must
not
wonder
if
in
a
little
time
you
find
the
majority
of
the
people
impressed
with
the
belief
that
the
king
in
the
view
of
the
law
is
nothing
but
a
mandarin
figure
which
has
to
nod
its
head
in
assent
or
shake
it
in
denial
as
his
minister
pleases
to
prevent
this
from
happening
it
was
of
extreme
importance
said
the
baron
that
no
opportunity
should
be
let
slip
of
vindicating
the
legitimate
position
of
the
crown
and
this
is
not
hard
to
do
he
added
and
can
never
embarrass
a
minister
where
such
straightforward
loyal
personages
as
the
queen
and
the
prince
are
concerned
in
his
opinion
the
very
lowest
claim
of
the
royal
prerogative
should
include
a
right
on
the
part
of
the
king
to
be
the
permanent
president
of
his
ministerial
council
the
sovereign
ought
to
be
in
the
position
of
a
permanent
premier
who
takes
rank
above
the
temporary
head
of
the
cabinet
and
in
matters
of
discipline
exercises
supreme
authority
the
sovereign
may
even
take
a
part
in
the
initiation
and
the
maturing
of
the
government
measures
for
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
expect
that
a
king
himself
as
able
as
accomplished
and
as
patriotic
as
the
best
of
his
ministers
should
be
prevented
from
making
use
of
these
qualities
at
the
deliberations
of
his
council
the
judicious
exercise
of
this
right
concluded
the
baron
which
certainly
requires
a
master
mind
would
not
only
be
the
best
guarantee
for
constitutional
monarchy
but
would
raise
it
to
a
height
of
power
stability
and
symmetry
which
has
never
been
attained
now
it
may
be
that
this
reading
of
the
constitution
is
a
possible
one
though
indeed
it
is
hard
to
see
how
it
can
be
made
compatible
with
the
fundamental
doctrine
of
ministerial
responsibility
william
iii
presided
over
his
council
and
he
was
a
constitutional
monarch
and
it
seems
that
stockmar
had
in
his
mind
a
conception
of
the
crown
which
would
have
given
it
a
place
in
the
constitution
analogous
to
that
which
it
filled
at
the
time
of
william
iii
but
it
is
clear
that
such
a
theory
which
would
invest
the
crown
with
more
power
than
it
possessed
even
under
george
iii
runs
counter
to
the
whole
development
of
english
public
life
since
the
revolution
and
the
fact
that
it
was
held
by
stockmar
and
instilled
by
him
into
albert
was
of
very
serious
importance
for
there
was
good
reason
to
believe
not
only
that
these
doctrines
were
held
by
albert
in
theory
but
that
he
was
making
a
deliberate
and
sustained
attempt
to
give
them
practical
validity
the
history
of
the
struggle
between
the
crown
and
palmerston
provided
startling
evidence
that
this
was
the
case
that
struggle
reached
its
culmination
when
in
memorandum
of
the
queen
asserted
her
constitutional
right
to
dismiss
the
foreign
secretary
if
he
altered
a
despatch
which
had
received
her
sanction
the
memorandum
was
in
fact
a
plain
declaration
that
the
crown
intended
to
act
independently
of
the
prime
minister
lord
john
russell
anxious
at
all
costs
to
strengthen
himself
against
palmerston
accepted
the
memorandum
and
thereby
implicitly
allowed
the
claim
of
the
crown
more
than
that
after
the
dismissal
of
palmerston
among
the
grounds
on
which
lord
john
justified
that
dismissal
in
the
house
of
commons
he
gave
a
prominent
place
to
the
memorandum
of
it
became
apparent
that
the
displeasure
of
the
sovereign
might
be
a
reason
for
the
removal
of
a
powerful
and
popular
minister
it
seemed
indeed
as
if
under
the
guidance
of
stockmar
and
albert
the
constitutional
monarchy
might
in
very
truth
be
rising
to
a
height
of
power
stability
and
symmetry
which
had
never
been
attained
but
this
new
development
in
the
position
of
the
crown
grave
as
it
was
in
itself
was
rendered
peculiarly
disquieting
by
the
unusual
circumstances
which
surrounded
it
for
the
functions
of
the
crown
were
now
in
effect
being
exercised
by
a
person
unknown
to
the
constitution
who
wielded
over
the
sovereign
an
undefined
and
unbounded
influence
the
fact
that
this
person
was
the
sovereign
husband
while
it
explained
his
influence
and
even
made
it
inevitable
by
no
means
diminished
its
strange
and
momentous
import
an
ambiguous
prepotent
figure
had
come
to
disturb
the
ancient
subtle
and
jealously
guarded
balance
of
the
english
constitution
such
had
been
the
unexpected
outcome
of
the
tentative
and
fainthearted
opening
of
albert
political
life
he
himself
made
no
attempt
to
minimise
either
the
multiplicity
or
the
significance
of
the
functions
he
performed
he
considered
that
it
was
his
duty
he
told
the
duke
of
wellington
in
to
sink
his
own
individual
existence
in
that
of
his
wife
assume
no
separate
responsibility
before
the
public
but
make
his
position
entirely
a
part
of
hers
fill
up
every
gap
which
as
a
woman
she
would
naturally
leave
in
the
exercise
of
her
regal
functions
continually
and
anxiously
watch
every
part
of
the
public
business
in
order
to
be
able
to
advise
and
assist
her
at
any
moment
in
any
of
the
multifarious
and
difficult
questions
or
duties
brought
before
her
sometimes
international
sometimes
political
or
social
or
personal
as
the
natural
head
of
her
family
superintendent
of
her
household
manager
of
her
private
affairs
sole
confidential
adviser
in
politics
and
only
assistant
in
her
communications
with
the
officers
of
the
government
he
is
besides
the
husband
of
the
queen
the
tutor
of
the
royal
children
the
private
secretary
of
the
sovereign
and
her
permanent
minister
stockmar
pupil
had
assuredly
gone
far
and
learnt
well
pupil
precisely
the
public
painfully
aware
of
albert
predominance
had
grown
too
uneasily
conscious
that
victoria
master
had
a
master
of
his
own
deep
in
the
darkness
the
baron
loomed
another
foreigner
decidedly
there
were
elements
in
the
situation
which
went
far
to
justify
the
popular
alarm
a
foreign
baron
controlled
a
foreign
prince
and
the
foreign
prince
controlled
the
crown
of
england
and
the
crown
itself
was
creeping
forward
ominously
and
when
from
under
its
shadow
the
baron
and
the
prince
had
frowned
a
great
minister
beloved
of
the
people
had
fallen
where
was
all
this
to
end
within
a
few
weeks
palmerston
withdrew
his
resignation
and
the
public
frenzy
subsided
as
quickly
as
it
had
arisen
when
parliament
met
the
leaders
of
both
the
parties
in
both
the
houses
made
speeches
in
favour
of
the
prince
asserting
his
unimpeachable
loyalty
to
the
country
and
vindicating
his
right
to
advise
the
sovereign
in
all
matters
of
state
victoria
was
delighted
the
position
of
my
beloved
lord
and
master
she
told
the
baron
has
been
defined
for
once
amid
all
and
his
merits
have
been
acknowledged
on
all
sides
most
duly
there
was
an
immense
concourse
of
people
assembled
when
we
went
to
the
house
of
lords
and
the
people
were
very
friendly
immediately
afterwards
the
country
finally
plunged
into
the
crimean
war
in
the
struggle
that
followed
albert
patriotism
was
put
beyond
a
doubt
and
the
animosities
of
the
past
were
forgotten
but
the
war
had
another
consequence
less
gratifying
to
the
royal
couple
it
crowned
the
ambition
of
lord
palmerston
in
the
man
who
five
years
before
had
been
pronounced
by
lord
john
russell
to
be
too
old
to
do
much
in
the
future
became
prime
minister
of
england
and
with
one
short
interval
remained
in
that
position
for
ten
years
chapter
vi
last
years
of
prince
consort
i
the
youth
who
took
no
interest
in
polities
and
never
read
a
newspaper
had
grown
into
a
man
of
unbending
determination
whose
tireless
energies
were
incessantly
concentrated
upon
the
laborious
business
of
government
and
the
highest
questions
of
state
he
was
busy
now
from
morning
till
night
in
the
winter
before
the
dawn
he
was
to
be
seen
seated
at
his
working
by
the
light
of
the
green
reading
lamp
which
he
had
brought
over
with
him
from
germany
and
the
construction
of
which
he
had
much
improved
by
an
ingenious
device
victoria
was
early
too
but
she
was
not
so
early
as
albert
and
when
in
the
chill
darkness
she
took
her
seat
at
her
own
placed
side
by
side
with
his
she
invariably
found
upon
it
a
neat
pile
of
papers
arranged
for
her
inspection
and
her
signature
the
day
thus
begun
continued
in
unremitting
industry
at
breakfast
the
newspapers
the
once
hated
newspapers
made
their
appearance
and
the
prince
absorbed
in
their
perusal
would
answer
no
questions
or
if
an
article
struck
him
would
read
it
aloud
after
that
there
were
ministers
and
secretaries
to
interview
there
was
a
vast
correspondence
to
be
carried
on
there
were
numerous
memoranda
to
be
made
victoria
treasuring
every
word
preserving
every
letter
was
all
breathless
attention
and
eager
obedience
sometimes
albert
would
actually
ask
her
advice
he
consulted
her
about
his
english
lese
recht
aufmerksam
und
sage
wenn
irgend
ein
fehler
ist
he
would
say
or
as
he
handed
her
a
draft
for
her
signature
he
would
observe
ich
hab
dir
hier
ein
draft
gemacht
lese
es
mal
ich
dachte
es
ware
recht
so
thus
the
diligent
scrupulous
absorbing
hours
passed
by
fewer
and
fewer
grew
the
moments
of
recreation
and
of
exercise
the
demands
of
society
were
narrowed
down
to
the
smallest
limits
and
even
then
but
grudgingly
attended
to
it
was
no
longer
a
mere
pleasure
it
was
a
positive
necessity
to
go
to
bed
as
early
as
possible
in
order
to
be
up
and
at
work
on
the
morrow
betimes
read
this
carefully
and
tell
me
if
there
are
any
mistakes
in
it
here
is
a
draft
i
have
made
for
you
read
it
i
should
think
this
would
do
the
important
and
exacting
business
of
government
which
became
at
last
the
dominating
preoccupation
in
albert
mind
still
left
unimpaired
his
old
tastes
and
interests
he
remained
devoted
to
art
to
science
to
philosophy
and
a
multitude
of
subsidiary
activities
showed
how
his
energies
increased
as
the
demands
upon
them
grew
for
whenever
duty
called
the
prince
was
all
alertness
with
indefatigable
perseverance
he
opened
museums
laid
the
foundation
stones
of
hospitals
made
speeches
to
the
royal
agricultural
society
and
attended
meetings
of
the
british
association
the
national
gallery
particularly
interested
him
he
drew
up
careful
regulations
for
the
arrangement
of
the
pictures
according
to
schools
and
he
attempted
though
in
vain
to
have
the
whole
collection
transported
to
south
kensington
feodora
now
the
princess
hohenlohe
after
a
visit
to
england
expressed
in
a
letter
to
victoria
her
admiration
of
albert
both
as
a
private
and
a
public
character
nor
did
she
rely
only
on
her
own
opinion
i
must
just
copy
out
she
said
what
klumpp
wrote
to
me
some
little
time
ago
and
which
is
quite
true
albert
is
one
of
the
few
royal
personages
who
can
sacrifice
to
any
principle
as
soon
as
it
has
become
evident
to
them
to
be
good
and
noble
all
those
notions
or
sentiments
to
which
others
owing
to
their
or
to
the
prejudices
of
their
rank
are
so
thoroughly
inclined
strongly
to
cling
there
is
something
so
truly
religious
in
this
the
princess
added
as
well
as
humane
and
just
most
soothing
to
my
feelings
which
are
so
often
hurt
and
disturbed
by
what
i
hear
and
see
victoria
from
the
depth
of
her
heart
subscribed
to
all
the
eulogies
of
feodora
and
klumpp
she
only
found
that
they
were
insufficient
as
she
watched
her
beloved
albert
after
toiling
with
state
documents
and
public
functions
devoting
every
spare
moment
of
his
time
to
domestic
duties
to
artistic
appreciation
and
to
intellectual
improvements
as
she
listened
to
him
cracking
his
jokes
at
the
luncheon
table
or
playing
mendelssohn
on
the
organ
or
pointing
out
the
merits
of
sir
edwin
landseer
pictures
as
she
followed
him
round
while
he
gave
instructions
about
the
breeding
of
cattle
or
decided
that
the
gainsboroughs
must
be
hung
higher
up
so
that
the
winterhalters
might
be
properly
seen
she
felt
perfectly
certain
that
no
other
wife
had
ever
had
such
a
husband
his
mind
was
apparently
capable
of
everything
and
she
was
hardly
surprised
to
learn
that
he
had
made
an
important
discovery
for
the
conversion
of
sewage
into
agricultural
manure
filtration
from
below
upwards
he
explained
through
some
appropriate
medium
which
retained
the
solids
and
set
free
the
fluid
sewage
for
irrigation
was
the
principle
of
the
scheme
all
previous
plans
he
said
would
have
cost
millions
mine
costs
next
to
nothing
unfortunately
owing
to
a
slight
miscalculation
the
invention
proved
to
be
impracticable
but
albert
intelligence
was
unrebuffed
and
he
passed
on
to
plunge
with
all
his
accustomed
ardour
into
a
prolonged
study
of
the
rudiments
of
lithography
but
naturally
it
was
upon
his
children
that
his
private
interests
and
those
of
victoria
were
concentrated
most
vigorously
the
royal
nurseries
showed
no
sign
of
emptying
the
birth
of
the
prince
arthur
in
was
followed
three
years
later
by
that
of
the
prince
leopold
and
in
the
princess
beatrice
was
born
a
family
of
nine
must
be
in
any
circumstances
a
grave
responsibility
and
the
prince
realised
to
the
full
how
much
the
high
destinies
of
his
offspring
intensified
the
need
of
parental
care
it
was
inevitable
that
he
should
believe
profoundly
in
the
importance
of
education
he
himself
had
been
the
product
of
education
stockmar
had
made
him
what
he
was
it
was
for
him
in
his
turn
to
be
a
stockmar
to
be
even
more
than
a
stockmar
to
the
young
creatures
he
had
brought
into
the
world
victoria
would
assist
him
a
stockmar
no
doubt
she
could
hardly
be
but
she
could
be
perpetually
vigilant
she
could
mingle
strictness
with
her
affection
and
she
could
always
set
a
good
example
these
considerations
of
course
applied
to
the
education
of
the
prince
of
wales
how
tremendous
was
the
significance
of
every
particle
of
influence
which
went
to
the
making
of
the
future
king
of
england
albert
set
to
work
with
a
will
but
watching
with
victoria
the
minutest
details
of
the
physical
intellectual
and
moral
training
of
his
children
he
soon
perceived
to
his
distress
that
there
was
something
unsatisfactory
in
the
development
of
his
eldest
son
the
princess
royal
was
an
extremely
intelligent
child
but
bertie
though
he
was
and
gentle
seemed
to
display
a
repugnance
to
every
form
of
mental
exertion
this
was
most
regrettable
but
the
remedy
was
obvious
the
parental
efforts
must
be
redoubled
instruction
must
be
multiplied
not
for
a
single
instant
must
the
educational
pressure
be
allowed
to
relax
accordingly
more
tutors
were
selected
the
curriculum
was
revised
the
of
studies
was
rearranged
elaborate
memoranda
dealing
with
every
possible
contingency
were
drawn
up
it
was
above
all
essential
that
there
should
be
no
slackness
work
said
the
prince
must
be
work
and
work
indeed
it
was
the
boy
grew
up
amid
a
ceaseless
round
of
paradigms
syntactical
exercises
dates
genealogical
tables
and
lists
of
capes
constant
notes
flew
backwards
and
forwards
between
the
prince
the
queen
and
the
tutors
with
inquiries
with
reports
of
progress
with
detailed
recommendations
and
these
notes
were
all
carefully
preserved
for
future
reference
it
was
besides
vital
that
the
heir
to
the
throne
should
be
protected
from
the
slightest
possibility
of
contamination
from
the
outside
world
the
prince
of
wales
was
not
as
other
boys
he
might
occasionally
be
allowed
to
invite
some
sons
of
the
nobility
boys
of
good
character
to
play
with
him
in
the
garden
of
buckingham
palace
but
his
father
presided
with
alarming
precision
over
their
sports
in
short
every
possible
precaution
was
taken
every
conceivable
effort
was
made
yet
strange
to
say
the
object
of
all
this
vigilance
and
solicitude
continued
to
be
unsatisfactory
appeared
in
fact
to
be
positively
growing
worse
it
was
certainly
very
odd
the
more
lessons
that
bertie
had
to
do
the
less
he
did
them
and
the
more
carefully
he
was
guarded
against
excitements
and
frivolities
the
more
desirous
of
mere
amusement
he
seemed
to
become
albert
was
deeply
grieved
and
victoria
was
sometimes
very
angry
but
grief
and
anger
produced
no
more
effect
than
supervision
and
the
prince
of
wales
in
spite
of
everything
grew
up
into
manhood
without
the
faintest
sign
of
adherence
to
and
perseverance
in
the
plan
both
of
studies
and
life
as
one
of
the
royal
memoranda
put
it
which
had
been
laid
down
with
such
extraordinary
forethought
by
his
father
ii
against
the
insidious
worries
of
politics
the
boredom
of
society
functions
and
the
pompous
publicity
of
state
ceremonies
osborne
had
afforded
a
welcome
refuge
but
it
soon
appeared
that
even
osborne
was
too
little
removed
from
the
world
after
all
the
solent
was
a
feeble
barrier
oh
for
some
distant
some
almost
inaccessible
sanctuary
where
in
true
domestic
privacy
one
could
make
happy
holiday
just
as
if
or
at
least
very
very
nearly
one
were
anybody
else
victoria
ever
since
together
with
albert
she
had
visited
scotland
in
the
early
years
of
her
marriage
had
felt
that
her
heart
was
in
the
highlands
she
had
returned
to
them
a
few
years
later
and
her
passion
had
grown
how
romantic
they
were
and
how
albert
enjoyed
them
too
his
spirits
rose
quite
wonderfully
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
among
the
hills
and
the
conifers
it
is
a
happiness
to
see
him
she
wrote
oh
what
can
equal
the
beauties
of
nature
she
exclaimed
in
her
journal
during
one
of
these
visits
what
enjoyment
there
is
in
them
albert
enjoys
it
so
much
he
is
in
ecstasies
here
albert
said
she
noted
next
day
that
the
chief
beauty
of
mountain
scenery
consists
in
its
frequent
changes
we
came
home
at
six
then
she
went
on
a
longer
expedition
up
to
the
very
top
of
a
high
hill
it
was
quite
romantic
here
we
were
with
only
this
highlander
behind
us
holding
the
ponies
for
we
got
off
twice
and
walked
about
we
came
home
at
eleven
the
most
delightful
most
romantic
ride
and
walk
i
ever
had
i
had
never
been
up
such
a
mountain
and
then
the
day
was
so
fine
the
highlanders
too
were
such
astonishing
people
they
never
make
difficulties
she
noted
but
are
cheerful
and
happy
and
merry
and
ready
to
walk
and
run
and
do
anything
as
for
albert
he
highly
appreciated
the
simplicity
and
intelligence
which
make
it
so
pleasant
and
even
instructive
to
talk
to
them
we
were
always
in
the
habit
wrote
her
majesty
of
conversing
with
the
highlanders
with
whom
one
comes
so
much
in
contact
in
the
highlands
she
loved
everything
about
them
their
customs
their
dress
their
dances
even
their
musical
instruments
there
were
nine
pipers
at
the
castle
she
wrote
after
staying
with
lord
breadalbane
sometimes
one
and
sometimes
three
played
they
always
played
about
again
during
the
morning
at
luncheon
and
also
whenever
we
went
in
and
out
again
before
dinner
and
during
most
of
we
both
have
become
quite
fond
of
the
it
was
quite
impossible
not
to
wish
to
return
to
such
pleasures
again
and
again
and
in
the
queen
took
a
lease
of
balmoral
house
a
small
residence
near
braemar
in
the
wilds
of
aberdeenshire
four
years
later
she
bought
the
place
outright
now
she
could
be
really
happy
every
summer
now
she
could
be
simple
and
at
her
ease
now
she
could
be
romantic
every
evening
and
dote
upon
albert
without
a
single
distraction
all
day
long
the
diminutive
scale
of
the
house
was
in
itself
a
charm
nothing
was
more
amusing
than
to
find
oneself
living
in
two
or
three
little
sitting
rooms
with
the
children
crammed
away
upstairs
and
the
minister
in
attendance
with
only
a
tiny
bedroom
to
do
all
his
work
in
and
then
to
be
able
to
run
in
and
out
of
doors
as
one
liked
and
to
sketch
and
to
walk
and
to
watch
the
red
deer
coming
so
surprisingly
close
and
to
pay
visits
to
the
cottagers
and
occasionally
one
could
be
more
adventurous
still
one
could
go
and
stay
for
a
night
or
two
at
the
bothie
at
a
mere
couple
of
huts
with
a
wooden
addition
and
only
eleven
people
in
the
whole
party
and
there
were
mountains
to
be
climbed
and
cairns
to
be
built
in
solemn
pomp
at
last
when
the
cairn
which
is
i
think
seven
or
eight
feet
high
was
nearly
completed
albert
climbed
up
to
the
top
of
it
and
placed
the
last
stone
after
which
three
cheers
were
given
it
was
a
gay
pretty
and
touching
sight
and
i
felt
almost
inclined
to
cry
the
view
was
so
beautiful
over
the
dear
hills
the
day
so
fine
the
whole
so
gemuthlich
and
in
the
evening
there
were
and
reels
but
albert
had
determined
to
pull
down
the
little
old
house
and
to
build
in
its
place
a
castle
of
his
own
designing
with
great
ceremony
in
accordance
with
a
memorandum
drawn
up
by
the
prince
for
the
occasion
the
of
the
new
edifice
was
laid
and
by
it
was
habitable
spacious
built
of
granite
in
the
scotch
baronial
style
with
a
tower
feet
high
and
minor
turrets
and
castellated
gables
the
castle
was
skilfully
arranged
to
command
the
finest
views
of
the
surrounding
mountains
and
of
the
neighbouring
river
dee
upon
the
interior
decorations
albert
and
victoria
lavished
all
their
care
the
wall
and
the
floors
were
of
and
covered
with
specially
manufactured
tartars
the
balmoral
tartan
in
red
and
grey
designed
by
the
prince
and
the
victoria
tartan
with
a
white
stripe
designed
by
the
queen
were
to
be
seen
in
every
room
there
were
tartan
curtains
and
tartan
and
even
tartan
linoleums
occasionally
the
royal
stuart
tartan
appeared
for
her
majesty
always
maintained
that
she
was
an
ardent
jacobite
sketches
by
victoria
hung
upon
the
walls
together
with
innumerable
stags
antlers
and
the
head
of
a
boar
which
had
been
shot
by
albert
in
germany
in
an
alcove
in
the
hall
stood
a
statue
of
albert
in
highland
dress
victoria
declared
that
it
was
perfection
every
year
she
wrote
my
heart
becomes
more
fixed
in
this
dear
paradise
and
so
much
more
so
now
that
all
has
become
my
dear
albert
own
creation
own
work
own
building
own
and
his
great
taste
and
the
impress
of
his
dear
hand
have
been
stamped
everywhere
and
here
in
very
truth
her
happiest
days
were
passed
in
after
years
when
she
looked
back
upon
them
a
kind
of
glory
a
radiance
as
of
an
unearthly
holiness
seemed
to
glow
about
these
golden
hours
each
hallowed
moment
stood
out
clear
beautiful
eternally
significant
for
at
the
time
every
experience
there
sentimental
or
grave
or
trivial
had
come
upon
her
with
a
peculiar
vividness
like
a
flashing
of
marvellous
lights
albert
stalkings
an
evening
walk
when
she
lost
her
way
vicky
sitting
down
on
a
wasps
nest
a
torchlight
dance
with
what
intensity
such
things
and
ten
thousand
like
them
impressed
themselves
upon
her
eager
consciousness
and
how
she
flew
to
her
journal
to
note
them
down
the
news
of
the
duke
death
what
a
moment
when
as
she
sat
sketching
after
a
picnic
by
a
loch
in
the
lonely
hills
lord
letter
had
been
brought
to
her
and
she
had
learnt
that
england
or
rather
britain
pride
her
glory
her
hero
the
greatest
man
she
had
ever
produced
was
no
morel
for
such
were
here
reflections
upon
the
old
rebel
of
former
days
but
that
past
had
been
utterly
obliterated
no
faintest
memory
of
it
remained
for
years
she
had
looked
up
to
the
duke
as
a
figure
almost
superhuman
had
he
not
been
a
supporter
of
good
sir
robert
had
he
not
asked
albert
to
succeed
him
as
and
what
a
proud
moment
it
had
been
when
he
stood
as
sponsor
to
her
son
arthur
who
was
born
on
his
birthday
so
now
she
filled
a
whole
page
of
her
diary
with
panegyrical
regrets
his
position
was
the
highest
a
subject
ever
had
above
party
looked
up
to
by
all
revered
by
the
whole
nation
the
friend
of
the
sovereign
the
crown
never
possessed
and
i
fear
never
will
so
devoted
loyal
and
faithful
a
subject
so
staunch
a
supporter
to
us
his
loss
is
irreparable
to
albert
he
showed
the
greatest
kindness
and
the
utmost
confidence
not
an
eye
will
be
dry
in
the
whole
country
these
were
serious
thoughts
but
they
were
soon
succeeded
by
others
hardly
less
moving
by
events
as
impossible
to
forget
by
macleod
sermon
on
nicodemus
by
the
gift
of
a
red
flannel
petticoat
to
farquharson
and
another
to
old
kitty
kear
but
without
doubt
most
memorable
most
delightful
of
all
were
the
expeditions
the
rare
exciting
expeditions
up
distant
mountains
across
broad
rivers
through
strange
country
and
lasting
several
days
with
only
two
gillies
grant
and
brown
for
servants
and
with
assumed
names
it
was
more
like
something
in
a
story
than
real
life
we
had
decided
to
call
ourselves
lord
and
lady
churchill
and
and
party
lady
churchill
passing
as
miss
spencer
and
general
grey
as
grey
brown
once
forgot
this
and
called
me
majesty
as
i
was
getting
into
the
carriage
and
grant
on
the
box
once
called
albert
royal
highness
which
set
us
off
laughing
but
no
one
observed
it
strong
vigorous
enthusiastic
bringing
so
it
seemed
good
fortune
with
her
the
highlanders
declared
she
had
a
lucky
foot
she
relished
everything
the
scrambles
and
the
views
and
the
contretemps
and
the
rough
inns
with
their
coarse
fare
and
brown
and
grant
waiting
at
table
she
could
have
gone
on
for
ever
and
ever
absolutely
happy
with
albert
beside
her
and
brown
at
her
pony
head
but
the
time
came
for
turning
homewards
alas
the
time
came
for
going
back
to
england
she
could
hardly
bear
it
she
sat
disconsolate
in
her
room
and
watched
the
snow
falling
the
last
day
oh
if
only
she
could
be
snowed
up
iii
the
crimean
war
brought
new
experiences
and
most
of
them
were
pleasant
ones
it
was
pleasant
to
be
patriotic
and
pugnacious
to
look
out
appropriate
prayers
to
be
read
in
the
churches
to
have
news
of
glorious
victories
and
to
know
oneself
more
proudly
than
ever
the
representative
of
england
with
that
spontaneity
of
feeling
which
was
so
peculiarly
her
own
victoria
poured
out
her
emotion
her
admiration
her
pity
her
love
upon
her
dear
soldiers
when
she
gave
them
their
medals
her
exultation
knew
no
bounds
noble
fellows
she
wrote
to
the
king
of
the
belgians
i
own
i
feel
as
if
these
were
my
own
children
my
heart
beats
for
them
as
for
my
nearest
and
dearest
they
were
so
touched
so
pleased
many
i
hear
cried
and
they
wo
hear
of
giving
up
their
medals
to
have
their
names
engraved
upon
them
for
fear
they
should
not
receive
the
identical
one
put
into
their
hands
by
me
which
is
quite
touching
several
came
by
in
a
sadly
mutilated
state
she
and
they
were
at
one
they
felt
that
she
had
done
them
a
splendid
honour
and
she
with
perfect
genuineness
shared
their
feeling
attitude
towards
such
things
was
different
there
was
an
austerity
in
him
which
quite
prohibited
the
expansions
of
emotion
when
general
williams
returned
from
the
heroic
defence
of
kars
and
was
presented
at
court
the
quick
stiff
distant
bow
with
which
the
prince
received
him
struck
like
ice
upon
the
beholders
he
was
a
stranger
still
but
he
had
other
things
to
occupy
him
more
important
surely
than
the
personal
impressions
of
military
officers
and
people
who
went
to
court
he
was
at
work
ceaselessly
at
work
on
the
tremendous
task
of
carrying
through
the
war
to
a
successful
conclusion
state
papers
despatches
memoranda
poured
from
him
in
an
overwhelming
stream
between
and
fifty
folio
volumes
were
filled
with
the
comments
of
his
pen
upon
the
eastern
question
nothing
would
induce
him
to
stop
weary
ministers
staggered
under
the
load
of
his
advice
but
his
advice
continued
piling
itself
up
over
their
and
flowing
out
upon
them
from
red
box
after
red
box
nor
was
it
advice
to
be
ignored
the
talent
for
administration
which
had
reorganised
the
royal
palaces
and
planned
the
great
exhibition
asserted
itself
no
less
in
the
confused
complexities
of
war
again
and
again
the
prince
suggestions
rejected
or
unheeded
at
first
were
adopted
under
the
stress
of
circumstances
and
found
to
be
full
of
value
the
enrolment
of
a
foreign
legion
the
establishment
of
a
depot
for
troops
at
malta
the
institution
of
periodical
reports
and
tabulated
returns
as
to
the
condition
of
the
army
at
sebastopol
such
were
the
contrivances
and
the
achievements
of
his
indefatigable
brain
he
went
further
in
a
lengthy
minute
he
laid
down
the
lines
for
a
radical
reform
in
the
entire
administration
of
the
army
this
was
premature
but
his
proposal
that
a
camp
of
evolution
should
be
created
in
which
troops
should
be
concentrated
and
drilled
proved
to
be
the
germ
of
aldershot
meanwhile
victoria
had
made
a
new
friend
she
had
suddenly
been
captivated
by
napoleon
iii
her
dislike
of
him
had
been
strong
at
first
she
considered
that
he
was
a
disreputable
adventurer
who
had
usurped
the
throne
of
poor
old
louis
philippe
and
besides
he
was
with
lord
palmerston
for
a
long
time
although
he
was
her
ally
she
was
unwilling
to
meet
him
but
at
last
a
visit
of
the
emperor
and
empress
to
england
was
arranged
directly
he
appeared
at
windsor
her
heart
began
to
soften
she
found
that
she
was
charmed
by
his
quiet
manners
his
low
soft
voice
and
by
the
soothing
simplicity
of
his
conversation
the
of
england
was
essential
to
the
emperor
position
in
europe
and
he
had
determined
to
fascinate
the
queen
he
succeeded
there
was
something
deep
within
her
which
responded
immediately
and
vehemently
to
natures
that
offered
a
romantic
contrast
with
her
own
her
adoration
of
lord
melbourne
was
intimately
interwoven
with
her
appreciation
of
the
exciting
unlikeness
between
herself
and
that
sophisticated
subtle
aristocratical
old
man
very
different
was
the
quality
of
her
unlikeness
to
napoleon
but
its
quantity
was
at
least
as
great
from
behind
the
vast
solidity
of
her
respectability
her
conventionality
her
established
happiness
she
peered
out
with
a
strange
delicious
pleasure
at
that
unfamiliar
foreign
object
moving
so
meteorically
before
her
an
ambiguous
creature
of
wilfulness
and
destiny
and
to
her
surprise
where
she
had
dreaded
antagonisms
she
discovered
only
sympathies
he
was
she
said
so
quiet
so
simple
naif
even
so
pleased
to
be
informed
about
things
he
does
not
know
so
gentle
so
full
of
tact
dignity
and
modesty
so
full
of
kind
attention
towards
us
never
saying
a
word
or
doing
a
thing
which
could
put
me
out
there
is
something
fascinating
melancholy
and
engaging
which
draws
you
to
him
in
spite
of
any
prevention
you
may
have
against
him
and
certainly
without
the
assistance
of
any
outward
appearance
though
i
like
his
face
she
observed
that
he
rode
extremely
well
and
looks
well
on
horseback
as
he
sits
high
and
he
danced
with
great
dignity
and
spirit
above
all
he
listened
to
albert
listened
with
the
most
respectful
attention
showed
in
fact
how
pleased
he
was
to
be
informed
about
things
he
did
not
know
and
afterwards
was
heard
to
declare
that
he
had
never
met
the
equal
on
one
occasion
indeed
but
only
on
one
he
had
seemed
to
grow
slightly
restive
in
a
diplomatic
conversation
i
expatiated
a
little
on
the
holstein
question
wrote
the
prince
in
a
memorandum
which
appeared
to
bore
the
emperor
as
compliquee
victoria
too
became
much
attached
to
the
empress
whose
looks
and
graces
she
admired
without
a
touch
of
jealousy
eugenie
indeed
in
the
plenitude
of
her
beauty
exquisitely
dressed
in
wonderful
parisian
crinolines
which
set
off
to
perfection
her
tall
and
willowy
figure
might
well
have
caused
some
in
the
breast
of
her
hostess
who
very
short
rather
stout
quite
plain
in
garish
garments
could
hardly
be
expected
to
feel
at
her
best
in
such
company
but
victoria
had
no
misgivings
to
her
it
mattered
nothing
that
her
face
turned
red
in
the
heat
and
that
her
purple
hat
was
of
last
year
fashion
while
eugenie
cool
and
modish
floated
in
an
infinitude
of
flounces
by
her
side
she
was
queen
of
england
and
was
not
that
enough
it
certainly
seemed
to
be
true
majesty
was
hers
and
she
knew
it
more
than
once
when
the
two
were
together
in
public
it
was
the
woman
to
whom
as
it
seemed
nature
and
art
had
given
so
little
who
by
the
sheer
force
of
an
inherent
grandeur
completely
threw
her
adorned
and
beautiful
companion
into
the
shade
there
were
tears
when
the
moment
came
for
parting
and
victoria
felt
quite
wehmuthig
as
her
guests
went
away
from
windsor
but
before
long
she
and
albert
paid
a
return
visit
to
france
where
everything
was
very
delightful
and
she
drove
incognito
through
the
streets
of
paris
in
a
common
bonnet
and
saw
a
play
in
the
theatre
at
st
cloud
and
one
evening
at
a
great
party
given
by
the
emperor
in
her
honour
at
the
chateau
of
versailles
talked
a
little
to
a
prussian
gentleman
whose
name
was
bismarck
her
rooms
were
furnished
so
much
to
her
taste
that
she
declared
they
gave
her
quite
a
home
feeling
that
if
her
little
dog
were
there
she
should
really
imagine
herself
at
home
nothing
was
said
but
three
days
later
her
little
dog
barked
a
welcome
to
her
as
she
entered
the
apartments
the
emperor
himself
sparing
neither
trouble
nor
expense
had
personally
arranged
the
charming
surprise
such
were
his
attentions
she
returned
to
england
more
enchanted
than
ever
strange
indeed
she
exclaimed
are
the
dispensations
and
ways
of
providence
the
alliance
prospered
and
the
war
drew
towards
a
conclusion
both
the
queen
and
the
prince
it
is
true
were
most
anxious
that
there
should
not
be
a
premature
peace
when
lord
aberdeen
wished
to
open
negotiations
albert
attacked
him
in
a
geharnischten
letter
while
victoria
rode
about
on
horseback
reviewing
the
troops
at
last
however
sebastopol
was
captured
the
news
reached
balmoral
late
at
night
and
in
a
few
minutes
albert
and
all
the
gentlemen
in
every
species
of
attire
sallied
forth
followed
by
all
the
servants
and
gradually
by
all
the
population
of
the
gillies
workmen
up
to
the
top
of
the
cairn
a
bonfire
was
lighted
the
pipes
were
played
and
guns
were
shot
off
about
of
an
hour
after
albert
came
down
and
said
the
scene
had
been
wild
and
exciting
beyond
everything
the
people
had
been
drinking
healths
in
whisky
and
were
in
great
ecstasy
the
great
ecstasy
perhaps
would
be
replaced
by
other
feelings
next
morning
but
at
any
rate
the
war
was
over
though
to
be
sure
its
end
seemed
as
difficult
to
account
for
as
its
beginning
the
dispensations
and
ways
of
providence
continued
to
be
strange
iv
an
unexpected
consequence
of
the
war
was
a
complete
change
in
the
relations
between
the
royal
pair
and
palmerston
the
prince
and
the
minister
drew
together
over
their
hostility
to
russia
and
thus
it
came
about
that
when
victoria
found
it
necessary
to
summon
her
old
enemy
to
form
an
administration
she
did
so
without
reluctance
the
premiership
too
had
a
sobering
effect
upon
palmerston
he
grew
less
impatient
and
dictatorial
considered
with
attention
the
suggestions
of
the
crown
and
was
besides
genuinely
impressed
by
the
prince
ability
and
knowledge
friction
no
doubt
there
still
occasionally
was
for
while
the
queen
and
the
prince
devoted
themselves
to
foreign
politics
as
much
as
ever
their
views
when
the
war
was
over
became
once
more
antagonistic
to
those
of
the
prime
minister
this
was
especially
the
case
with
regard
to
italy
albert
theoretically
the
friend
of
constitutional
government
distrusted
cavour
was
horrified
by
garibaldi
and
dreaded
the
danger
of
england
being
drawn
into
war
with
austria
palmerston
on
the
other
hand
was
eager
for
italian
independence
but
he
was
no
longer
at
the
foreign
office
and
the
brunt
of
the
royal
displeasure
had
now
to
be
borne
by
lord
john
russell
in
a
few
years
the
situation
had
curiously
altered
it
was
lord
john
who
now
filled
the
subordinate
and
the
ungrateful
role
but
the
foreign
secretary
in
his
struggle
with
the
crown
was
supported
instead
of
opposed
by
the
prime
minister
nevertheless
the
struggle
was
fierce
and
the
policy
by
which
the
vigorous
sympathy
of
england
became
one
of
the
decisive
factors
in
the
final
achievement
of
italian
unity
was
only
carried
through
in
face
of
the
violent
opposition
of
the
court
towards
the
other
european
also
the
prince
attitude
continued
to
be
very
different
to
that
of
palmerston
albert
great
wish
was
for
a
united
germany
under
the
leadership
of
a
constitutional
and
virtuous
prussia
palmerston
did
not
think
that
there
was
much
to
be
said
for
the
scheme
but
he
took
no
particular
interest
in
german
politics
and
was
ready
enough
to
agree
to
a
proposal
which
was
warmly
supported
by
both
the
prince
and
the
queen
that
the
royal
houses
of
england
and
prussia
should
be
united
by
the
marriage
of
the
princess
royal
with
the
prussian
crown
prince
accordingly
when
the
princess
was
not
yet
fifteen
the
prince
a
young
man
of
came
over
on
a
visit
to
balmoral
and
the
betrothal
took
place
two
years
later
in
the
marriage
was
celebrated
at
the
last
moment
however
it
seemed
that
there
might
be
a
hitch
it
was
pointed
out
in
prussia
that
it
was
customary
for
princes
of
the
blood
royal
to
be
married
in
berlin
and
it
was
suggested
that
there
was
no
reason
why
the
present
case
should
be
treated
as
an
exception
when
this
reached
the
ears
of
victoria
she
was
speechless
with
indignation
in
a
note
emphatic
even
for
her
majesty
she
instructed
the
foreign
secretary
to
tell
the
prussian
ambassador
not
to
entertain
the
possibility
of
such
a
question
the
queen
never
could
consent
to
it
both
for
public
and
for
private
reasons
and
the
assumption
of
its
being
too
much
for
a
prince
royal
of
prussia
to
come
over
to
marry
the
princess
royal
of
great
britain
in
england
is
too
absurd
to
say
the
least
whatever
may
be
the
usual
practice
of
prussian
princes
it
is
not
every
day
that
one
marries
the
eldest
daughter
of
the
queen
of
england
the
question
must
therefore
be
considered
as
settled
and
closed
it
was
and
the
wedding
took
place
in
james
chapel
there
were
great
festivities
illuminations
state
concerts
immense
crowds
and
general
rejoicings
at
windsor
a
magnificent
banquet
was
given
to
the
bride
and
bridegroom
in
the
waterloo
room
at
which
victoria
noted
in
her
diary
everybody
was
most
friendly
and
kind
about
vicky
and
full
of
the
universal
enthusiasm
of
which
the
duke
of
buccleuch
gave
us
most
pleasing
instances
he
having
been
in
the
very
thick
of
the
crowd
and
among
the
lowest
of
the
low
her
feelings
during
several
days
had
been
growing
more
and
more
emotional
and
when
the
time
came
for
the
young
couple
to
depart
she
very
nearly
broke
down
but
not
quite
poor
dear
child
she
wrote
afterwards
i
clasped
her
in
my
arms
and
blessed
her
and
knew
not
what
to
say
i
kissed
good
fritz
and
pressed
his
hand
again
and
again
he
was
unable
to
speak
and
the
tears
were
in
his
eyes
i
embraced
them
both
again
at
the
carriage
door
and
albert
got
into
the
carriage
an
open
one
with
them
and
bertie
the
band
struck
up
i
wished
to
the
good
perponchers
general
schreckenstein
was
much
affected
i
pressed
his
hand
and
the
good
dean
and
then
went
quickly
upstairs
albert
as
well
as
general
schreckenstein
was
much
affected
he
was
losing
his
favourite
child
whose
opening
intelligence
had
already
begun
to
display
a
marked
resemblance
to
his
own
an
adoring
pupil
who
in
a
few
years
might
have
become
an
almost
adequate
companion
an
ironic
fate
had
determined
that
the
daughter
who
was
taken
from
him
should
be
sympathetic
clever
interested
in
the
arts
and
sciences
and
endowed
with
a
strong
taste
for
memoranda
while
not
a
single
one
of
these
qualities
could
be
discovered
in
the
son
who
remained
for
certainly
the
prince
of
wales
did
not
take
after
his
father
victoria
prayer
had
been
unanswered
and
with
each
succeeding
year
it
became
more
obvious
that
bertie
was
a
true
scion
of
the
house
of
brunswick
but
these
evidences
of
innate
characteristics
only
served
to
redouble
the
efforts
of
his
parents
it
still
might
not
be
too
late
to
incline
the
young
branch
by
ceaseless
pressure
and
careful
fastenings
to
grow
in
the
proper
direction
everything
was
tried
the
boy
was
sent
on
a
continental
tour
with
a
picked
body
of
tutors
but
the
results
were
unsatisfactory
at
his
father
request
he
kept
a
diary
which
on
his
return
was
inspected
by
the
prince
it
was
found
to
be
distressingly
meagre
what
a
multitude
of
highly
interesting
reflections
might
have
been
arranged
under
the
heading
the
first
prince
of
wales
visiting
the
pope
but
there
was
not
a
single
one
le
jeune
prince
plaisit
a
tout
le
monde
old
metternich
reported
to
guizot
mais
avait
embarrasse
et
tres
triste
on
his
seventeenth
birthday
a
memorandum
was
drawn
up
over
the
names
of
the
queen
and
the
prince
informing
their
eldest
son
that
he
was
now
entering
upon
the
period
of
manhood
and
directing
him
henceforward
to
perform
the
duties
of
a
christian
gentleman
life
is
composed
of
duties
said
the
memorandum
and
in
the
due
punctual
and
cheerful
performance
of
them
the
true
christian
true
soldier
and
true
gentleman
is
recognised
a
new
sphere
of
life
will
open
for
you
in
which
you
will
have
to
be
taught
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
a
subject
requiring
study
more
important
than
any
in
which
you
have
hitherto
been
engaged
on
receipt
of
the
memorandum
bertie
burst
into
tears
at
the
same
time
another
memorandum
was
drawn
up
headed
confidential
for
the
guidance
of
the
gentlemen
appointed
to
attend
on
the
prince
of
wales
this
long
and
elaborate
document
laid
down
certain
principles
by
which
the
conduct
and
demeanour
of
the
gentlemen
were
to
be
regulated
and
which
it
is
thought
may
conduce
to
the
benefit
of
the
prince
of
wales
the
qualities
which
distinguish
a
gentleman
in
society
continued
this
remarkable
paper
are
his
appearance
his
deportment
and
dress
the
character
of
his
relations
with
and
treatment
of
others
his
desire
and
power
to
acquit
himself
creditably
in
conversation
or
whatever
is
the
occupation
of
the
society
with
which
he
mixes
a
minute
and
detailed
analysis
of
these
subheadings
followed
filling
several
pages
and
the
memorandum
ended
with
a
final
exhortation
to
the
gentlemen
if
they
will
duly
appreciate
the
responsibility
of
their
position
and
taking
the
points
above
laid
down
as
the
outline
will
exercise
their
own
good
sense
in
acting
upon
all
occasions
all
upon
these
principles
thinking
no
point
of
detail
too
minute
to
be
important
but
maintaining
one
steady
consistent
line
of
conduct
they
may
render
essential
service
to
the
young
prince
and
justify
the
flattering
selection
made
by
the
royal
parents
a
year
later
the
young
prince
was
sent
to
oxford
where
the
greatest
care
was
taken
that
he
should
not
mix
with
the
undergraduates
yes
everything
had
been
tried
everything
with
one
single
exception
the
experiment
had
never
been
made
of
letting
bertie
enjoy
himself
but
why
should
it
have
been
life
is
composed
of
duties
what
possible
place
could
there
be
for
enjoyment
in
the
existence
of
a
prince
of
wales
the
same
year
which
deprived
albert
of
the
princess
royal
brought
him
another
and
a
still
more
serious
loss
the
baron
had
paid
his
last
visit
to
england
for
twenty
years
as
he
himself
said
in
a
letter
to
the
king
of
the
belgians
he
had
performed
the
laborious
and
exhausting
office
of
a
paternal
friend
and
trusted
adviser
to
the
prince
and
the
queen
he
was
seventy
he
was
tired
physically
and
mentally
it
was
time
to
go
he
returned
to
his
home
in
coburg
exchanging
once
for
all
the
momentous
secrecies
of
european
statecraft
for
the
of
a
provincial
capital
and
the
gossip
of
family
life
in
his
stiff
chair
by
the
fire
he
nodded
now
over
old
stories
not
of
emperors
and
generals
but
of
neighbours
and
relatives
and
the
domestic
adventures
of
long
ago
the
burning
of
his
father
library
and
the
goat
that
ran
upstairs
to
his
sister
room
and
ran
twice
round
the
table
and
then
ran
down
again
dyspepsia
and
depression
still
attacked
him
but
looking
back
over
his
life
he
was
not
dissatisfied
his
conscience
was
clear
i
have
worked
as
long
as
i
had
strength
to
work
he
said
and
for
a
purpose
no
one
can
impugn
the
consciousness
of
this
is
my
reward
the
only
one
which
i
desired
to
earn
apparently
indeed
his
purpose
had
been
accomplished
by
his
wisdom
his
patience
and
his
example
he
had
brought
about
in
the
fullness
of
time
the
miraculous
metamorphosis
of
which
he
had
dreamed
the
prince
was
his
creation
an
indefatigable
toiler
presiding
for
the
highest
ends
over
a
great
nation
that
was
his
achievement
and
he
looked
upon
his
work
and
it
was
good
but
had
the
baron
no
misgivings
did
he
never
wonder
whether
perhaps
he
might
have
accomplished
not
too
little
but
too
much
how
subtle
and
how
dangerous
are
the
snares
which
fate
lays
for
the
wariest
of
men
albert
certainly
seemed
to
be
everything
that
stockmar
could
have
wished
virtuous
industrious
persevering
intelligent
and
yet
why
was
it
all
was
not
well
with
him
he
was
sick
at
heart
for
in
spite
of
everything
he
had
never
reached
to
happiness
his
work
for
which
at
last
he
came
to
crave
with
an
almost
morbid
appetite
was
a
solace
and
not
a
cure
the
dragon
of
his
dissatisfaction
devoured
with
dark
relish
that
tribute
of
laborious
days
and
nights
but
it
was
hungry
still
the
causes
of
his
melancholy
were
hidden
mysterious
unanalysable
perhaps
too
deeply
rooted
in
the
innermost
recesses
of
his
temperament
for
the
eye
of
reason
to
apprehend
there
were
contradictions
in
his
nature
which
to
some
of
those
who
knew
him
best
made
him
seem
an
inexplicable
enigma
he
was
severe
and
gentle
he
was
modest
and
scornful
he
longed
for
affection
and
he
was
cold
he
was
lonely
not
merely
with
the
loneliness
of
exile
but
with
the
loneliness
of
conscious
and
unrecognised
superiority
he
had
the
pride
at
once
resigned
and
overweening
of
a
doctrinaire
and
yet
to
say
that
he
was
simply
a
doctrinaire
would
be
a
false
description
for
the
pure
doctrinaire
rejoices
always
in
an
internal
contentment
and
albert
was
very
far
from
doing
that
there
was
something
that
he
wanted
and
that
he
could
never
get
what
was
it
some
absolute
some
ineffable
sympathy
some
extraordinary
some
sublime
success
possibly
it
was
a
mixture
of
both
to
dominate
and
to
be
understood
to
conquer
by
the
same
triumphant
influence
the
submission
and
the
appreciation
of
men
that
would
be
worth
while
indeed
but
to
such
imaginations
he
saw
too
clearly
how
faint
were
the
responses
of
his
actual
environment
who
was
there
who
appreciated
him
really
and
truly
who
could
appreciate
him
in
england
and
if
the
gentle
virtue
of
an
inward
excellence
availed
so
little
could
he
expect
more
from
the
hard
ways
of
skill
and
force
the
terrible
land
of
his
exile
loomed
before
him
a
frigid
an
impregnable
mass
doubtless
he
had
made
some
slight
impression
it
was
true
that
he
had
gained
the
respect
of
his
fellow
workers
that
his
probity
his
industry
his
exactitude
had
been
recognised
that
he
was
a
highly
influential
an
extremely
important
man
but
how
far
how
very
far
was
all
this
from
the
goal
of
his
ambitions
how
feeble
and
futile
his
efforts
seemed
against
the
enormous
coagulation
of
dullness
of
folly
of
slackness
of
ignorance
of
confusion
that
confronted
him
he
might
have
the
strength
or
the
ingenuity
to
make
some
small
change
for
the
better
here
or
there
to
rearrange
some
detail
to
abolish
some
anomaly
to
insist
upon
some
obvious
reform
but
the
heart
of
the
appalling
organism
remained
untouched
england
lumbered
on
impervious
and
in
her
old
intolerable
course
he
threw
himself
across
the
path
of
the
monster
with
rigid
purpose
and
set
teeth
but
he
was
brushed
aside
yes
even
palmerston
was
still
unconquered
was
still
there
to
afflict
him
with
his
jauntiness
his
his
utter
lack
of
principle
it
was
too
much
neither
nature
nor
the
baron
had
given
him
a
sanguine
spirit
the
seeds
of
pessimism
once
lodged
within
him
flourished
in
a
propitious
soil
he
questioned
things
and
did
not
find
one
that
would
answer
to
his
mind
and
all
the
world
appeared
unkind
he
believed
that
he
was
a
failure
and
he
began
to
despair
yet
stockmar
had
told
him
that
he
must
never
relax
and
he
never
would
he
would
go
on
working
to
the
utmost
and
striving
for
the
highest
to
the
bitter
end
his
industry
grew
almost
maniacal
earlier
and
earlier
was
the
green
lamp
lighted
more
vast
grew
the
correspondence
more
searching
the
examination
of
the
newspapers
the
interminable
memoranda
more
punctilious
analytical
and
precise
his
very
recreations
became
duties
he
enjoyed
himself
by
went
with
meticulous
gusto
and
made
puns
at
lunch
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
the
mechanism
worked
with
astonishing
efficiency
but
it
never
rested
and
it
was
never
oiled
in
dry
exactitude
the
innumerable
perpetually
revolved
no
whatever
happened
the
prince
would
not
relax
he
had
absorbed
the
doctrines
of
stockmar
too
thoroughly
he
knew
what
was
right
and
at
all
costs
he
would
pursue
it
that
was
certain
but
alas
in
this
our
life
what
are
the
certainties
in
nothing
be
says
an
old
greek
the
due
measure
in
all
the
works
of
man
is
best
for
often
one
who
zealously
pushes
towards
some
excellence
though
he
be
pursuing
a
gain
is
really
being
led
utterly
astray
by
the
will
of
some
power
which
makes
those
things
that
are
evil
seem
to
him
good
and
those
things
seem
to
him
evil
that
are
for
his
advantage
surely
both
the
prince
and
the
baron
might
have
learnt
something
from
the
frigid
wisdom
of
theognis
victoria
noticed
that
her
husband
sometimes
seemed
to
be
depressed
and
overworked
she
tried
to
cheer
him
up
realising
uneasily
that
he
was
still
regarded
as
a
foreigner
she
hoped
that
by
conferring
upon
him
the
title
of
prince
consort
she
would
improve
his
position
in
the
country
the
queen
has
a
right
to
claim
that
her
husband
should
be
an
englishman
she
wrote
but
unfortunately
in
spite
of
the
royal
letters
patent
albert
remained
as
foreign
as
before
and
as
the
years
passed
his
dejection
deepened
she
worked
with
him
she
watched
over
him
she
walked
with
him
through
the
woods
at
osborne
while
he
whistled
to
the
nightingales
as
he
had
whistled
once
at
rosenau
so
long
ago
when
his
birthday
came
round
she
took
the
greatest
pains
to
choose
him
presents
that
he
would
really
like
in
when
he
was
she
gave
him
a
picture
of
beatrice
in
oil
by
horsley
a
complete
collection
of
photographic
views
of
gotha
and
the
country
round
which
i
had
taken
by
bedford
and
a
of
balmoral
granite
and
teeth
designed
by
vicky
albert
was
of
course
delighted
and
his
merriment
at
the
family
gathering
was
more
pronounced
than
ever
and
yet
what
was
there
that
was
wrong
no
doubt
it
was
his
health
he
was
wearing
himself
out
in
the
service
of
the
country
and
certainly
his
constitution
as
stockmar
had
perceived
from
the
first
was
to
meet
a
serious
strain
he
was
easily
upset
he
constantly
suffered
from
minor
ailments
his
appearance
in
itself
was
enough
to
indicate
the
infirmity
of
his
physical
powers
the
handsome
youth
of
twenty
years
since
with
the
flashing
eyes
and
the
soft
complexion
had
grown
into
a
sallow
man
whose
body
in
its
stoop
and
its
loose
fleshiness
betrayed
the
sedentary
labourer
and
whose
head
was
quite
bald
on
the
top
unkind
critics
who
had
once
compared
albert
to
an
operatic
tenor
might
have
remarked
that
there
was
something
of
the
butler
about
him
now
beside
victoria
he
presented
a
painful
contrast
she
too
was
stout
but
it
was
with
the
plumpness
of
a
vigorous
matron
and
an
eager
vitality
was
everywhere
visible
in
her
energetic
bearing
her
protruding
enquiring
glances
her
small
fat
capable
and
commanding
hands
if
only
by
some
sympathetic
magic
she
could
have
conveyed
into
that
portly
flabby
figure
that
desiccated
and
discouraged
brain
a
measure
of
the
stamina
and
the
which
were
so
hers
but
suddenly
she
was
reminded
that
there
were
other
perils
besides
those
of
during
a
visit
to
coburg
in
the
prince
was
very
nearly
killed
in
a
carriage
accident
he
escaped
with
a
few
cuts
and
bruises
but
victoria
alarm
was
extreme
though
she
concealed
it
it
is
when
the
queen
feels
most
deeply
she
wrote
afterwards
that
she
always
appears
calmest
and
she
could
not
and
dared
not
allow
herself
to
speak
of
what
might
have
been
or
even
to
admit
to
herself
and
she
can
not
and
dare
not
now
the
entire
danger
for
her
head
would
turn
her
agitation
in
fact
was
only
surpassed
by
her
thankfulness
to
god
she
felt
she
said
that
she
could
not
rest
without
doing
something
to
mark
permanently
her
feelings
and
she
decided
that
she
would
endow
a
charity
in
coburg
or
even
given
either
at
once
or
in
instalments
yearly
would
not
in
the
queen
opinion
be
too
much
eventually
the
smaller
sum
having
been
fixed
upon
it
was
invested
in
a
trust
called
the
in
the
name
of
the
burgomaster
and
chief
clergyman
of
coburg
who
were
directed
to
distribute
the
interest
yearly
among
a
certain
number
of
young
men
and
women
of
exemplary
character
belonging
to
the
humbler
ranks
of
life
shortly
afterwards
the
queen
underwent
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
the
actual
experience
of
close
personal
loss
early
in
the
duchess
of
kent
was
taken
seriously
ill
and
in
march
she
died
the
event
overwhelmed
victoria
with
a
morbid
intensity
she
filled
her
diary
for
pages
with
minute
descriptions
of
her
mother
last
hours
her
dissolution
and
her
corpse
interspersed
with
vehement
apostrophes
and
the
agitated
outpourings
of
emotional
reflection
in
the
grief
of
the
present
the
disagreements
of
the
past
were
totally
forgotten
it
was
the
horror
and
the
mystery
of
death
death
present
and
actual
that
seized
upon
the
imagination
of
the
queen
her
whole
being
so
instinct
with
vitality
recoiled
in
agony
from
the
grim
spectacle
of
the
triumph
of
that
awful
power
her
own
mother
with
whom
she
had
lived
so
closely
and
so
long
that
she
had
become
a
part
almost
of
her
existence
had
fallen
into
nothingness
before
her
very
eyes
she
tried
to
forget
but
she
could
not
her
lamentations
continued
with
a
strange
abundance
a
strange
persistency
it
was
almost
as
if
by
some
mysterious
and
unconscious
precognition
she
realised
that
for
her
in
an
especial
manner
that
grisly
majesty
had
a
dreadful
dart
in
store
for
indeed
before
the
year
was
out
a
far
more
terrible
blow
was
to
fall
upon
her
albert
who
had
for
long
been
suffering
from
sleeplessness
went
on
a
cold
and
drenching
day
towards
the
end
of
november
to
inspect
the
buildings
for
the
new
military
academy
at
sandhurst
on
his
return
it
was
clear
that
the
fatigue
and
exposure
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
had
seriously
affected
his
health
he
was
attacked
by
rheumatism
his
sleeplessness
continued
and
he
complained
that
he
felt
thoroughly
unwell
three
days
later
a
painful
duty
obliged
him
to
visit
cambridge
the
prince
of
wales
who
had
been
placed
at
that
university
in
the
previous
year
was
behaving
in
such
a
manner
that
a
parental
visit
and
a
parental
admonition
had
become
necessary
the
disappointed
father
suffering
in
mind
and
body
carried
through
his
task
but
on
his
return
journey
to
windsor
he
caught
a
fatal
chill
during
the
next
week
he
gradually
grew
weaker
and
more
miserable
yet
depressed
and
enfeebled
as
he
was
he
continued
to
work
it
so
happened
that
at
that
very
moment
a
grave
diplomatic
crisis
had
arisen
civil
war
had
broken
out
in
america
and
it
seemed
as
if
england
owing
to
a
violent
quarrel
with
the
northern
states
was
upon
the
point
of
being
drawn
into
the
conflict
a
severe
despatch
by
lord
john
russell
was
submitted
to
the
queen
and
the
prince
perceived
that
if
it
was
sent
off
unaltered
war
would
be
the
almost
inevitable
consequence
at
seven
on
the
morning
of
december
he
rose
from
his
bed
and
with
a
quavering
hand
wrote
a
series
of
suggestions
for
the
alteration
of
the
draft
by
which
its
language
might
be
softened
and
a
way
left
open
for
a
peaceful
solution
of
the
question
these
changes
were
accepted
by
the
government
and
war
was
averted
it
was
the
prince
last
memorandum
he
had
always
declared
that
he
viewed
the
prospect
of
death
with
equanimity
i
do
not
cling
to
life
he
had
once
said
to
victoria
you
do
but
i
set
no
store
by
it
and
then
he
had
added
i
am
sure
if
i
had
a
severe
illness
i
should
give
up
at
once
i
should
not
struggle
for
life
i
have
no
tenacity
of
life
he
had
judged
correctly
before
he
had
been
ill
many
days
he
told
a
friend
that
he
was
convinced
he
would
not
recover
he
sank
and
sank
nevertheless
if
his
case
had
been
properly
understood
and
skilfully
treated
from
the
first
he
might
conceivably
have
been
saved
but
the
doctors
failed
to
diagnose
his
symptoms
and
it
is
noteworthy
that
his
principal
physician
was
sir
james
clark
when
it
was
suggested
that
other
advice
should
be
taken
sir
james
the
idea
there
was
no
cause
for
alarm
he
said
but
the
strange
illness
grew
worse
at
last
after
a
letter
of
fierce
remonstrance
from
palmerston
watson
was
sent
for
and
watson
saw
at
once
that
he
had
come
too
late
the
prince
was
in
the
grip
of
typhoid
fever
i
think
that
everything
so
far
is
satisfactory
said
sir
james
clark
clarendon
ii
one
can
not
speak
with
certainty
but
it
is
horrible
to
think
that
such
a
life
may
have
been
sacrificed
to
sir
clark
selfish
jealousy
of
every
member
of
his
profession
the
earl
of
clarendon
to
the
duchess
of
manchester
december
the
restlessness
and
the
acute
suffering
of
the
earlier
days
gave
place
to
a
settled
torpor
and
an
ever
deepening
gloom
once
the
failing
patient
asked
for
music
a
fine
chorale
at
a
distance
and
a
piano
having
been
placed
in
the
adjoining
room
princess
alice
played
on
it
some
of
luther
hymns
after
which
the
prince
repeated
the
rock
of
ages
sometimes
his
mind
wandered
sometimes
the
distant
past
came
rushing
upon
him
he
heard
the
birds
in
the
early
morning
and
was
at
rosenau
again
a
boy
or
victoria
would
come
and
read
to
him
peveril
of
the
peak
and
he
showed
that
he
could
follow
the
story
and
then
she
would
bend
over
him
and
he
would
murmur
liebes
frauchen
and
gutes
weibchen
stroking
her
cheek
her
distress
and
her
agitation
were
great
but
she
was
not
seriously
frightened
buoyed
up
by
her
own
abundant
energies
she
would
not
believe
that
albert
might
prove
unequal
to
the
strain
she
refused
to
face
such
a
hideous
possibility
she
declined
to
see
watson
why
should
she
had
not
sir
james
clark
assured
her
that
all
would
be
well
only
two
days
before
the
end
which
was
seen
now
to
be
almost
inevitable
by
everyone
about
her
she
wrote
full
of
apparent
confidence
to
the
king
of
the
belgians
i
do
not
sit
up
with
him
at
night
she
said
as
i
could
be
of
no
use
and
there
is
nothing
to
cause
alarm
the
princess
alice
tried
to
tell
her
the
truth
but
her
hopefulness
would
not
be
daunted
on
the
morning
of
december
albert
just
as
she
had
expected
seemed
to
be
better
perhaps
the
crisis
was
over
but
in
the
course
of
the
day
there
was
a
serious
relapse
then
at
last
she
allowed
herself
to
see
that
she
was
standing
on
the
edge
of
an
appalling
gulf
the
whole
family
was
summoned
and
one
after
another
the
children
took
a
silent
farewell
of
their
father
it
was
a
terrible
moment
victoria
wrote
in
her
diary
but
thank
god
i
was
able
to
command
myself
and
to
be
perfectly
calm
and
remained
sitting
by
his
side
he
murmured
something
but
she
could
not
hear
what
it
was
she
thought
he
was
speaking
in
french
then
all
at
once
he
began
to
arrange
his
hair
just
as
he
used
to
do
when
well
and
he
was
dressing
es
kleines
frauchen
she
whispered
to
him
and
he
seemed
to
understand
for
a
moment
towards
the
evening
she
went
into
another
room
but
was
immediately
called
back
she
saw
at
a
glance
that
a
ghastly
change
had
taken
place
as
she
knelt
by
the
bed
he
breathed
deeply
breathed
gently
breathed
at
last
no
more
his
features
became
perfectly
rigid
she
shrieked
one
long
wild
shriek
that
rang
through
the
castle
and
understood
that
she
had
lost
him
for
ever
chapter
vii
widowhood
i
the
death
of
the
prince
consort
was
the
central
in
the
history
of
queen
victoria
she
herself
felt
that
her
true
life
had
ceased
with
her
husband
and
that
the
remainder
of
her
days
upon
earth
was
of
a
twilight
nature
an
epilogue
to
a
drama
that
was
done
nor
is
it
possible
that
her
biographer
should
escape
a
similar
impression
for
him
too
there
is
a
darkness
over
the
latter
half
of
that
long
career
the
first
forty
two
years
of
the
queen
life
are
illuminated
by
a
great
and
varied
quantity
of
authentic
information
with
death
a
veil
descends
only
occasionally
at
fitful
and
disconnected
intervals
does
it
lift
for
a
moment
or
two
a
few
main
outlines
a
few
remarkable
details
may
be
discerned
the
rest
is
all
conjecture
and
ambiguity
thus
though
the
queen
survived
her
great
bereavement
for
almost
as
many
years
as
she
had
lived
before
it
the
chronicle
of
those
years
can
bear
no
proportion
to
the
tale
of
her
earlier
life
we
must
be
content
in
our
ignorance
with
a
brief
and
summary
relation
the
sudden
removal
of
the
prince
was
not
merely
a
matter
of
overwhelming
personal
concern
to
victoria
it
was
an
event
of
national
of
european
importance
he
was
only
and
in
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
he
might
have
been
expected
to
live
at
least
thirty
years
longer
had
he
done
so
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
the
whole
development
of
the
english
polity
would
have
been
changed
already
at
the
time
of
his
death
he
filled
a
unique
place
in
english
public
life
already
among
the
inner
circle
of
politicians
he
was
accepted
as
a
necessary
and
useful
part
of
the
mechanism
of
the
state
lord
clarendon
for
instance
spoke
of
his
death
as
a
national
calamity
of
far
greater
importance
than
the
public
dream
of
and
lamented
the
loss
of
his
sagacity
and
foresight
which
he
declared
would
have
been
more
than
ever
valuable
in
the
event
of
an
american
war
and
as
time
went
on
the
prince
influence
must
have
enormously
increased
for
in
addition
to
his
intellectual
and
moral
qualities
he
enjoyed
by
virtue
of
his
position
one
supreme
advantage
which
every
other
holder
of
high
office
in
the
country
was
without
he
was
permanent
politicians
came
and
went
but
the
prince
was
perpetually
installed
at
the
centre
of
affairs
who
can
doubt
that
towards
the
end
of
the
century
such
a
man
grown
grey
in
the
service
of
the
nation
virtuous
intelligent
and
with
the
unexampled
experience
of
a
whole
of
government
would
have
acquired
an
extraordinary
prestige
if
in
his
youth
he
had
been
able
to
pit
the
crown
against
the
mighty
palmerston
and
to
come
off
with
equal
honours
from
the
contest
of
what
might
he
not
have
been
capable
in
his
old
age
what
minister
however
able
however
popular
could
have
withstood
the
wisdom
the
irreproachability
the
vast
prescriptive
authority
of
the
venerable
prince
it
is
easy
to
imagine
how
under
such
a
ruler
an
attempt
might
have
been
made
to
convert
england
into
a
state
as
exactly
organised
as
elaborately
trained
as
efficiently
equipped
and
as
autocratically
controlled
as
prussia
herself
then
perhaps
eventually
under
some
powerful
leader
a
gladstone
or
a
bright
the
democratic
forces
in
the
country
might
have
rallied
together
and
a
struggle
might
have
followed
in
which
the
monarchy
would
have
been
shaken
to
its
foundations
or
on
the
other
hand
disraeli
hypothetical
prophecy
might
have
come
true
with
prince
albert
he
said
we
have
buried
our
sovereign
this
german
prince
has
governed
england
for
years
with
a
wisdom
and
energy
such
as
none
of
our
kings
have
ever
shown
if
he
had
outlived
some
of
our
stagers
he
would
have
given
us
the
blessings
of
absolute
government
the
english
constitution
that
indescribable
entity
is
a
living
thing
growing
with
the
growth
of
men
and
assuming
forms
in
accordance
with
the
subtle
and
complex
laws
of
human
character
it
is
the
child
of
wisdom
and
chance
the
wise
men
of
moulded
it
into
the
shape
we
know
but
the
chance
that
george
i
could
not
speak
english
gave
it
one
of
its
essential
peculiarities
the
system
of
a
cabinet
independent
of
the
crown
and
subordinate
to
the
prime
minister
the
wisdom
of
lord
grey
saved
it
from
petrifaction
and
destruction
and
set
it
upon
the
path
of
democracy
then
chance
intervened
once
more
a
female
sovereign
happened
to
marry
an
able
and
pertinacious
man
and
it
seemed
likely
that
an
element
which
had
been
quiescent
within
it
for
years
the
element
of
irresponsible
administrative
power
was
about
to
become
its
predominant
characteristic
and
to
change
completely
the
direction
of
its
growth
but
what
chance
gave
chance
took
away
the
consort
perished
in
his
prime
and
the
english
constitution
dropping
the
dead
limb
with
hardly
a
tremor
continued
its
mysterious
life
as
if
he
had
never
been
one
human
being
and
one
alone
felt
the
full
force
of
what
had
happened
the
baron
by
his
fireside
at
coburg
suddenly
saw
the
tremendous
fabric
of
his
creation
crash
down
into
sheer
and
irremediable
ruin
albert
was
gone
and
he
had
lived
in
vain
even
his
blackest
hypochondria
had
never
envisioned
quite
so
miserable
a
catastrophe
victoria
wrote
to
him
visited
him
tried
to
console
him
by
declaring
with
passionate
conviction
that
she
would
carry
on
her
husband
work
he
smiled
a
sad
smile
and
looked
into
the
fire
then
he
murmured
that
he
was
going
where
albert
was
that
he
would
not
be
long
he
shrank
into
himself
his
children
clustered
round
him
and
did
their
best
to
comfort
him
but
it
was
useless
the
baron
heart
was
broken
he
lingered
for
eighteen
months
and
then
with
his
pupil
explored
the
shadow
and
the
dust
ii
with
appalling
suddenness
victoria
had
exchanged
the
serene
radiance
of
happiness
for
the
utter
darkness
of
woe
in
the
first
dreadful
moments
those
about
her
had
feared
that
she
might
lose
her
reason
but
the
iron
strain
within
her
held
firm
and
in
the
intervals
between
the
intense
paroxysms
of
grief
it
was
observed
that
the
queen
was
calm
she
remembered
too
that
albert
had
always
disapproved
of
exaggerated
manifestations
of
feeling
and
her
one
remaining
desire
was
to
do
nothing
but
what
he
would
have
wished
yet
there
were
moments
when
her
royal
anguish
would
brook
no
restraints
one
day
she
sent
for
the
duchess
of
sutherland
and
leading
her
to
the
prince
room
fell
prostrate
before
his
clothes
in
a
flood
of
weeping
while
she
adjured
the
duchess
to
tell
her
whether
the
beauty
of
albert
character
had
ever
been
surpassed
at
other
times
a
feeling
akin
to
indignation
swept
over
her
the
poor
fatherless
baby
of
eight
months
she
wrote
to
the
king
of
the
belgians
is
now
the
utterly
heartbroken
and
crushed
widow
of
my
life
as
a
happy
one
is
ended
the
world
is
gone
for
me
oh
to
be
cut
off
in
the
prime
of
life
to
see
our
pure
happy
quiet
domestic
life
which
alone
enabled
me
to
bear
my
much
disliked
position
cut
off
at
when
i
had
hoped
with
such
instinctive
certainty
that
god
never
would
part
us
and
would
let
us
grow
old
together
though
he
always
talked
of
the
shortness
of
life
is
too
awful
too
cruel
the
tone
of
outraged
majesty
seems
to
be
discernible
did
she
wonder
in
her
heart
of
hearts
how
the
deity
could
have
dared
but
all
other
emotions
gave
way
before
her
overmastering
determination
to
continue
absolutely
unchanged
and
for
the
rest
of
her
life
on
earth
her
reverence
her
obedience
her
idolatry
i
am
anxious
to
repeat
one
thing
she
told
her
uncle
and
that
one
is
my
firm
resolve
my
irrevocable
decision
that
his
wishes
his
plans
about
everything
his
views
about
every
thing
are
to
be
my
law
and
no
human
power
will
make
me
swerve
from
what
he
decided
and
wished
she
grew
fierce
she
grew
furious
at
the
thought
of
any
possible
intrusion
between
her
and
her
desire
her
uncle
was
coming
to
visit
her
and
it
flashed
upon
her
that
he
might
try
to
interfere
with
her
and
seek
to
rule
the
roost
as
of
old
she
would
give
him
a
hint
i
am
also
determined
she
wrote
that
no
one
person
may
he
be
ever
so
good
ever
so
devoted
among
my
servants
is
to
lead
or
guide
or
dictate
to
me
i
know
how
he
would
disapprove
it
though
miserably
weak
and
utterly
shattered
my
spirit
rises
when
i
think
any
wish
or
plan
of
his
is
to
be
touched
or
changed
or
i
am
to
be
made
to
do
anything
she
ended
her
letter
in
grief
and
affection
she
was
she
said
his
ever
wretched
but
devoted
child
victoria
and
then
she
looked
at
the
date
it
was
the
of
december
an
agonising
pang
assailed
her
and
she
dashed
down
a
postcript
what
a
xmas
i
wo
think
of
it
at
first
in
the
tumult
of
her
distresses
she
declared
that
she
could
not
see
her
ministers
and
the
princess
alice
assisted
by
sir
charles
phipps
the
keeper
of
the
privy
purse
performed
to
the
best
of
her
ability
the
functions
of
an
intermediary
after
a
few
weeks
however
the
cabinet
through
lord
john
russell
ventured
to
warn
the
queen
that
this
could
not
continue
she
realised
that
they
were
right
albert
would
have
agreed
with
them
and
so
she
sent
for
the
prime
minister
but
when
lord
palmerston
arrived
at
osborne
in
the
pink
of
health
brisk
with
his
whiskers
freshly
dyed
and
dressed
in
a
brown
overcoat
light
grey
trousers
green
gloves
and
blue
studs
he
did
not
create
a
very
good
impression
nevertheless
she
had
grown
attached
to
her
old
enemy
and
the
thought
of
a
political
change
filled
her
with
agitated
apprehensions
the
government
she
knew
might
fall
at
any
moment
she
felt
she
could
not
face
such
an
eventuality
and
therefore
six
months
after
the
death
of
the
prince
she
took
the
unprecedented
step
of
sending
a
private
message
to
lord
derby
the
leader
of
the
opposition
to
tell
him
that
she
was
not
in
a
fit
state
of
mind
or
body
to
undergo
the
anxiety
of
a
change
of
government
and
that
if
he
turned
the
present
ministers
out
of
office
it
would
be
at
the
risk
of
sacrificing
her
life
or
her
reason
when
this
message
reached
lord
derby
he
was
considerably
surprised
dear
me
was
his
cynical
comment
i
did
think
she
was
so
fond
of
them
as
that
though
the
violence
of
her
perturbations
gradually
subsided
her
cheerfulness
did
not
return
for
months
for
years
she
continued
in
settled
gloom
her
life
became
one
of
almost
complete
seclusion
arrayed
in
thickest
crepe
she
passed
dolefully
from
windsor
to
osborne
from
osborne
to
balmoral
rarely
visiting
the
capital
refusing
to
take
any
part
in
the
ceremonies
of
state
shutting
herself
off
from
the
slightest
intercourse
with
society
she
became
almost
as
unknown
to
her
subjects
as
some
potentate
of
the
east
they
might
murmur
but
they
did
not
understand
what
had
she
to
do
with
empty
shows
and
vain
enjoyments
no
she
was
absorbed
by
very
different
preoccupations
she
was
the
devoted
guardian
of
a
sacred
trust
her
place
was
in
the
inmost
shrine
of
the
house
of
mourning
where
she
alone
had
the
right
to
enter
where
she
could
feel
the
effluence
of
a
mysterious
presence
and
interpret
however
faintly
and
feebly
the
promptings
of
a
still
living
soul
that
and
that
only
was
her
glorious
her
terrible
duty
for
terrible
indeed
it
was
as
the
years
passed
her
depression
seemed
to
deepen
and
her
loneliness
to
grow
more
intense
i
am
on
a
dreary
sad
pinnacle
of
solitary
grandeur
she
said
again
and
again
she
felt
that
she
could
bear
her
situation
no
longer
that
she
would
sink
under
the
strain
and
then
instantly
that
voice
spoke
and
she
braced
herself
once
more
to
perform
with
minute
conscientiousness
her
grim
and
holy
task
above
all
else
what
she
had
to
do
was
to
make
her
own
the
of
albert
life
she
must
work
as
he
had
worked
in
the
service
of
the
country
that
vast
burden
of
toil
which
he
had
taken
upon
his
shoulders
it
was
now
for
her
to
bear
she
assumed
the
gigantic
load
and
naturally
she
staggered
under
it
while
he
had
lived
she
had
worked
indeed
with
regularity
and
conscientiousness
but
it
was
work
made
easy
made
delicious
by
his
care
his
forethought
his
advice
and
his
infallibility
the
mere
sound
of
his
voice
asking
her
to
sign
a
paper
had
thrilled
her
in
such
a
presence
she
could
have
laboured
gladly
for
ever
but
now
there
was
a
hideous
change
now
there
were
no
neat
piles
and
docketings
under
the
green
lamp
now
there
were
no
simple
explanations
of
difficult
matters
now
there
was
nobody
to
tell
her
what
was
right
and
what
was
wrong
she
had
her
secretaries
no
doubt
there
were
sir
charles
phipps
and
general
grey
and
sir
thomas
biddulph
and
they
did
their
best
but
they
were
mere
subordinates
the
whole
weight
of
initiative
and
responsibility
rested
upon
her
alone
for
so
it
had
to
be
i
am
determined
had
she
not
declared
it
that
no
one
person
is
to
lead
or
guide
or
dictate
to
me
anything
else
would
be
a
betrayal
of
her
trust
she
would
follow
the
prince
in
all
things
he
had
refused
to
delegate
authority
he
had
examined
into
every
detail
with
his
own
eyes
he
had
made
it
a
rule
never
to
sign
a
paper
without
having
first
not
merely
read
it
but
made
notes
on
it
too
she
would
do
the
same
she
sat
from
morning
till
night
surrounded
by
huge
heaps
of
despatch
boxes
reading
and
writing
at
her
desk
at
her
desk
alas
which
stood
alone
now
in
the
room
within
two
years
of
albert
death
a
violent
disturbance
in
foreign
politics
put
victoria
faithfulness
to
a
crucial
test
the
fearful
dispute
which
had
been
smouldering
for
more
than
a
decade
showed
signs
of
bursting
out
into
conflagration
the
complexity
of
the
questions
at
issue
was
indescribable
only
three
people
said
palmerston
have
ever
really
understood
the
business
the
prince
consort
who
is
dead
a
german
professor
who
has
gone
mad
and
i
who
have
forgotten
all
about
it
but
though
the
prince
might
be
dead
had
he
not
left
a
vicegerent
behind
him
victoria
threw
herself
into
the
seething
embroilment
with
the
vigour
of
inspiration
she
devoted
hours
daily
to
the
study
of
the
affair
in
all
its
windings
but
she
had
a
clue
through
the
labyrinth
whenever
the
question
had
been
discussed
albert
she
recollected
it
perfectly
had
always
taken
the
side
of
prussia
her
course
was
clear
she
became
an
ardent
champion
of
the
prussian
point
of
view
it
was
a
legacy
from
the
prince
she
said
she
did
not
realise
that
the
prussia
of
the
day
was
dead
and
that
a
new
prussia
the
prussia
of
bismarck
was
born
perhaps
palmerston
with
his
queer
prescience
instinctively
apprehended
the
new
danger
at
any
rate
he
and
lord
john
were
agreed
upon
the
necessity
of
supporting
denmark
against
prussia
claims
but
opinion
was
sharply
divided
not
only
in
the
country
but
in
the
cabinet
for
eighteen
months
the
controversy
raged
while
the
queen
with
persistent
vehemence
opposed
the
prime
minister
and
the
foreign
secretary
when
at
last
the
final
crisis
arose
when
it
seemed
possible
that
england
would
join
forces
with
denmark
in
a
war
against
prussia
victoria
agitation
grew
febrile
in
its
intensity
towards
her
german
relatives
she
preserved
a
discreet
appearance
of
impartiality
but
she
poured
out
upon
her
ministers
a
flood
of
appeals
protests
and
expostulations
she
invoked
the
sacred
cause
of
peace
the
only
chance
of
preserving
peace
for
europe
she
wrote
is
by
not
assisting
denmark
who
has
brought
this
entirely
upon
herself
the
queen
suffers
much
and
her
nerves
are
more
and
more
totally
shattered
but
though
all
this
anxiety
is
wearing
her
out
it
will
not
shake
her
firm
purpose
of
resisting
any
attempt
to
involve
this
country
in
a
mad
and
useless
combat
she
was
she
declared
prepared
to
make
a
stand
even
if
the
resignation
of
the
foreign
secretary
should
follow
the
queen
she
told
lord
granville
is
completely
exhausted
by
the
anxiety
and
suspense
and
misses
her
beloved
husband
help
advice
support
and
love
in
an
overwhelming
manner
she
was
so
worn
out
by
her
efforts
for
peace
that
she
could
hardly
hold
up
her
head
or
hold
her
pen
england
did
not
go
to
war
and
denmark
was
left
to
her
fate
but
how
far
the
attitude
of
the
queen
contributed
to
this
result
it
is
impossible
with
our
present
knowledge
to
say
on
the
whole
however
it
seems
probable
that
the
determining
factor
in
the
situation
was
the
powerful
peace
party
in
the
cabinet
rather
than
the
imperious
and
pathetic
pressure
of
victoria
it
is
at
any
rate
certain
that
the
queen
enthusiasm
for
the
sacred
cause
of
peace
was
within
a
few
months
her
mind
had
completely
altered
her
eyes
were
opened
to
the
true
nature
of
prussia
whose
designs
upon
austria
were
about
to
culminate
in
the
seven
war
veering
precipitately
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
she
now
urged
her
ministers
to
interfere
by
force
of
arms
in
support
of
austria
but
she
urged
in
vain
her
political
activity
no
more
than
her
social
seclusion
was
approved
by
the
public
as
the
years
passed
and
the
royal
mourning
remained
as
unrelieved
as
ever
the
animadversions
grew
more
general
and
more
severe
it
was
observed
that
the
queen
protracted
privacy
not
only
cast
a
gloom
over
high
society
not
only
deprived
the
populace
of
its
pageantry
but
also
exercised
a
highly
deleterious
effect
upon
the
dressmaking
millinery
and
hosiery
trades
this
latter
consideration
carried
great
weight
at
last
early
in
the
rumour
spread
that
her
majesty
was
about
to
go
out
of
mourning
and
there
was
much
rejoicing
in
the
newspapers
but
unfortunately
it
turned
out
that
the
rumour
was
quite
without
foundation
victoria
with
her
own
hand
wrote
a
letter
to
the
times
to
say
so
this
idea
she
declared
can
not
be
too
explicitly
contradicted
the
queen
the
letter
continued
heartily
appreciates
the
desire
of
her
subjects
to
see
her
and
whatever
she
can
do
to
gratify
them
in
this
loyal
and
affectionate
wish
she
will
do
but
there
are
other
and
higher
duties
than
those
of
mere
representation
which
are
now
thrown
upon
the
queen
alone
and
unassisted
duties
which
she
can
not
neglect
without
injury
to
the
public
service
which
weigh
unceasingly
upon
her
overwhelming
her
with
work
and
anxiety
the
justification
might
have
been
considered
more
cogent
had
it
not
been
known
that
those
other
and
higher
duties
emphasised
by
the
queen
consisted
for
the
most
part
of
an
attempt
to
counteract
the
foreign
policy
of
lord
palmerston
and
lord
john
russell
a
large
section
perhaps
a
majority
of
the
nation
were
violent
partisans
of
denmark
in
the
quarrel
and
victoria
support
of
prussia
was
widely
denounced
a
wave
of
unpopularity
which
reminded
old
observers
of
the
period
preceding
the
queen
marriage
more
than
years
before
was
beginning
to
rise
the
press
was
rude
lord
ellenborough
attacked
the
queen
in
the
house
of
lords
there
were
curious
whispers
in
high
quarters
that
she
had
had
thoughts
of
abdicating
whispers
followed
by
regrets
that
she
had
not
done
so
victoria
outraged
and
injured
felt
that
she
was
misunderstood
she
was
profoundly
unhappy
after
lord
ellenborough
speech
general
grey
declared
that
he
had
never
seen
the
queen
so
completely
upset
oh
how
fearful
it
is
she
herself
wrote
to
lord
granville
to
be
suspected
uncheered
unguided
and
unadvised
and
how
alone
the
poor
queen
feels
nevertheless
suffer
as
she
might
she
was
as
resolute
as
ever
she
would
not
move
by
a
hair
breadth
from
the
course
that
a
supreme
obligation
marked
out
for
her
she
would
be
faithful
to
the
end
and
so
when
was
forgotten
and
even
the
image
of
the
prince
had
begun
to
grow
dim
in
the
fickle
memories
of
men
the
solitary
watcher
remained
immutably
concentrated
at
her
peculiar
task
the
world
hostility
steadily
increasing
was
confronted
and
outfaced
by
the
impenetrable
weeds
of
victoria
would
the
world
never
understand
it
was
not
mere
sorrow
that
kept
her
so
strangely
sequestered
it
was
devotion
it
was
it
was
the
laborious
legacy
of
love
unceasingly
the
pen
moved
over
the
paper
the
flesh
might
be
weak
but
that
vast
burden
must
be
borne
and
fortunately
if
the
world
would
not
understand
there
were
faithful
friends
who
did
there
was
lord
granville
and
there
was
kind
theodore
martin
perhaps
martin
who
was
so
clever
would
find
means
to
make
people
realise
the
facts
she
would
send
him
a
letter
pointing
out
her
arduous
labours
and
the
difficulties
under
which
she
struggled
and
then
he
might
write
an
article
for
one
of
the
magazines
it
is
not
she
told
him
in
the
queen
sorrow
that
keeps
her
secluded
it
is
her
overwhelming
work
and
her
health
which
is
greatly
shaken
by
her
sorrow
and
the
totally
overwhelming
amount
of
work
and
responsibility
work
which
she
feels
really
wears
her
out
alice
helps
was
wonderfully
struck
at
the
room
and
if
martin
will
look
at
it
she
can
tell
martin
what
surrounds
her
from
the
hour
she
gets
out
of
bed
till
she
gets
into
it
again
there
is
work
work
work
questions
which
are
dreadfully
exhausting
and
if
she
had
not
comparative
rest
and
quiet
in
the
evening
she
would
most
likely
not
be
alive
her
brain
is
constantly
overtaxed
it
was
too
true
iii
to
carry
on
albert
work
that
was
her
first
duty
but
there
was
another
second
only
to
that
and
yet
nearer
if
possible
to
her
heart
to
impress
the
true
nature
of
his
genius
and
character
upon
the
minds
of
her
subjects
she
realised
that
during
his
life
he
had
not
been
properly
appreciated
the
full
extent
of
his
powers
the
supreme
quality
of
his
goodness
had
been
necessarily
concealed
but
death
had
removed
the
need
of
barriers
and
now
her
husband
in
his
magnificent
entirety
should
stand
revealed
to
all
she
set
to
work
methodically
she
directed
sir
arthur
helps
to
bring
out
a
collection
of
the
prince
speeches
and
addresses
and
the
weighty
tome
appeared
in
then
she
commanded
general
grey
to
write
an
account
of
the
prince
early
years
from
his
birth
to
his
marriage
she
herself
laid
down
the
design
of
the
book
contributed
a
number
of
confidential
documents
and
added
numerous
notes
general
grey
obeyed
and
the
work
was
completed
in
but
the
principal
part
of
the
story
was
still
untold
and
martin
was
forthwith
instructed
to
write
a
complete
biography
of
the
prince
consort
martin
laboured
for
fourteen
years
the
mass
of
material
with
which
he
had
to
deal
was
almost
incredible
but
he
was
extremely
industrious
and
he
enjoyed
throughout
the
gracious
assistance
of
her
majesty
the
first
bulky
volume
was
published
in
four
others
slowly
followed
so
that
it
was
not
until
that
the
monumental
work
was
finished
martin
was
rewarded
by
a
knighthood
and
yet
it
was
sadly
evident
that
neither
sir
theodore
nor
his
predecessors
had
achieved
the
purpose
which
the
queen
had
in
view
perhaps
she
was
unfortunate
in
her
coadjutors
but
in
reality
the
responsibility
for
the
failure
must
lie
with
victoria
herself
sir
theodore
and
the
others
faithfully
carried
out
the
task
which
she
had
set
them
faithfully
put
before
the
public
the
very
image
of
albert
that
filled
her
own
mind
the
fatal
drawback
was
that
the
public
did
not
find
that
image
attractive
emotional
nature
far
more
remarkable
for
vigour
than
for
subtlety
rejecting
utterly
the
qualifications
which
perspicuity
or
humour
might
suggest
could
be
satisfied
with
nothing
but
the
absolute
and
the
categorical
when
she
disliked
she
did
so
with
an
unequivocal
emphasis
which
swept
the
object
of
her
repugnance
at
once
and
finally
outside
the
pale
of
consideration
and
her
feelings
of
affection
were
equally
unmitigated
in
the
case
of
albert
her
passion
for
superlatives
reached
its
height
to
have
conceived
of
him
as
anything
short
of
perfect
perfect
in
virtue
in
wisdom
in
beauty
in
all
the
glories
and
graces
of
man
would
have
been
an
unthinkable
blasphemy
perfect
he
was
and
perfect
he
must
be
shown
to
have
been
and
so
sir
arthur
sir
theodore
and
the
general
painted
him
in
the
circumstances
and
under
such
supervision
to
have
done
anything
else
would
have
required
talents
considerably
more
distinguished
than
any
that
those
gentlemen
possessed
but
that
was
not
all
by
a
curious
mischance
victoria
was
also
able
to
press
into
her
service
another
writer
the
distinction
of
whose
talents
was
this
time
beyond
a
doubt
the
poet
laureate
adopting
either
from
complaisance
or
conviction
the
tone
of
his
sovereign
joined
in
the
chorus
and
endowed
the
royal
formula
with
the
magical
resonance
of
verse
this
settled
the
matter
henceforward
it
was
impossible
to
forget
that
albert
had
worn
the
white
flower
of
a
blameless
life
the
result
was
doubly
unfortunate
victoria
disappointed
and
chagrined
bore
a
grudge
against
her
people
for
their
refusal
in
spite
of
all
her
efforts
to
rate
her
husband
at
his
true
worth
she
did
not
understand
that
the
picture
of
an
embodied
perfection
is
distasteful
to
the
majority
of
mankind
the
cause
of
this
is
not
so
much
an
envy
of
the
perfect
being
as
a
suspicion
that
he
must
be
inhuman
and
thus
it
happened
that
the
public
when
it
saw
displayed
for
its
admiration
a
figure
resembling
the
sugary
hero
of
a
moral
rather
than
a
fellow
man
of
flesh
and
blood
turned
away
with
a
shrug
a
smile
and
a
flippant
ejaculation
but
in
this
the
public
was
the
loser
as
well
as
victoria
for
in
truth
albert
was
a
far
more
interesting
personage
than
the
public
dreamed
by
a
curious
irony
an
impeccable
waxwork
had
been
fixed
by
the
queen
love
in
the
popular
imagination
while
the
creature
whom
it
represented
the
real
creature
so
full
of
energy
and
stress
and
torment
so
mysterious
and
so
unhappy
and
so
fallible
and
so
very
human
had
altogether
disappeared
iv
words
and
books
may
be
ambiguous
memorials
but
who
can
misinterpret
the
visible
solidity
of
bronze
and
stone
at
frogmore
near
windsor
where
her
mother
was
buried
victoria
constructed
at
the
cost
of
a
vast
and
elaborate
mausoleum
for
herself
and
her
husband
but
that
was
a
private
and
domestic
monument
and
the
queen
desired
that
wherever
her
subjects
might
be
gathered
together
they
should
be
reminded
of
the
prince
her
desire
was
gratified
all
over
the
country
at
aberdeen
at
perth
and
at
wolverhampton
statues
of
the
prince
were
erected
and
the
queen
making
an
exception
to
her
rule
of
retirement
unveiled
them
herself
nor
did
the
capital
lag
behind
a
month
after
the
death
a
meeting
was
called
together
at
the
mansion
house
to
discuss
schemes
for
honouring
his
memory
opinions
however
were
divided
upon
the
subject
was
a
statue
or
an
institution
to
be
preferred
meanwhile
a
subscription
was
opened
an
influential
committee
was
appointed
and
the
queen
was
consulted
as
to
her
wishes
in
the
matter
her
majesty
replied
that
she
would
prefer
a
granite
obelisk
with
sculptures
at
the
base
to
an
institution
but
the
committee
hesitated
an
obelisk
to
be
worthy
of
the
name
must
clearly
be
a
monolith
and
where
was
the
quarry
in
england
capable
of
furnishing
a
granite
block
of
the
required
size
it
was
true
that
there
was
granite
in
russian
finland
but
the
committee
were
advised
that
it
was
not
adapted
to
resist
exposure
to
the
open
air
on
the
whole
therefore
they
suggested
that
a
memorial
hall
should
be
erected
together
with
a
statue
of
the
prince
her
majesty
assented
but
then
another
difficulty
arose
it
was
found
that
not
more
than
had
been
subscribed
a
sum
insufficient
to
defray
the
double
expense
the
hall
therefore
was
abandoned
a
statue
alone
was
to
be
erected
and
certain
eminent
architects
were
asked
to
prepare
designs
eventually
the
committee
had
at
their
disposal
a
total
sum
of
since
the
public
subscribed
another
while
was
voted
by
parliament
some
years
later
a
joint
stock
company
was
formed
and
built
as
a
private
speculation
the
albert
hall
the
architect
whose
design
was
selected
both
by
the
committee
and
by
the
queen
was
gilbert
scott
whose
industry
conscientiousness
and
genuine
piety
had
brought
him
to
the
head
of
his
profession
his
lifelong
zeal
for
the
gothic
style
having
given
him
a
special
prominence
his
handiwork
was
strikingly
visible
not
only
in
a
multitude
of
original
buildings
but
in
most
of
the
cathedrals
of
england
protests
indeed
were
occasionally
raised
against
his
renovations
but
scott
replied
with
such
vigour
and
unction
in
articles
and
pamphlets
that
not
a
dean
was
unconvinced
and
he
was
permitted
to
continue
his
labours
without
interruption
on
one
occasion
however
his
devotion
to
gothic
had
placed
him
in
an
unpleasant
situation
the
government
offices
in
whitehall
were
to
be
rebuilt
scott
competed
and
his
designs
were
successful
naturally
they
were
in
the
gothic
style
combining
a
certain
squareness
and
horizontality
of
outline
with
gables
roofs
and
dormers
and
the
drawings
as
scott
himself
observed
were
perhaps
the
best
ever
sent
in
to
a
competition
or
nearly
so
after
the
usual
difficulties
and
delays
the
work
was
at
last
to
be
put
in
hand
when
there
was
a
change
of
government
and
lord
palmerston
became
prime
minister
lord
palmerston
at
once
sent
for
scott
well
scott
he
said
in
his
jaunty
way
i
ca
have
anything
to
do
with
this
gothic
style
i
must
insist
on
your
making
a
design
in
the
italian
manner
which
i
am
sure
you
can
do
very
cleverly
scott
was
appalled
the
style
of
the
italian
renaissance
was
not
only
unsightly
it
was
positively
immoral
and
he
sternly
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
thereupon
lord
palmerston
assumed
a
fatherly
tone
quite
true
a
gothic
architect
ca
be
expected
to
put
up
a
classical
building
i
must
find
someone
else
this
was
intolerable
and
scott
on
his
return
home
addressed
to
the
prime
minister
a
letter
in
which
he
dwelt
upon
his
position
as
an
architect
upon
his
having
won
two
european
competitions
his
being
an
a
gold
medallist
of
the
institute
and
a
lecturer
on
architecture
at
the
royal
academy
but
it
was
useless
lord
palmerston
did
not
even
reply
it
then
occurred
to
scott
that
by
a
judicious
mixture
he
might
while
preserving
the
essential
character
of
the
gothic
produce
a
design
which
would
give
a
superficial
impression
of
the
classical
style
he
did
so
but
no
effect
was
produced
upon
lord
palmerston
the
new
design
he
said
was
neither
one
thing
nor
a
regular
mongrel
affair
and
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
either
after
that
scott
found
it
necessary
to
recruit
for
two
months
at
scarborough
with
a
course
of
quinine
he
recovered
his
tone
at
last
but
only
at
the
cost
of
his
convictions
for
the
sake
of
his
family
he
felt
that
it
was
his
unfortunate
duty
to
obey
the
prime
minister
and
shuddering
with
horror
he
constructed
the
government
offices
in
a
strictly
renaissance
style
shortly
afterwards
scott
found
some
consolation
in
building
the
pancras
hotel
in
a
style
of
his
own
and
now
another
and
yet
more
satisfactory
task
was
his
my
idea
in
designing
the
memorial
he
wrote
was
to
erect
a
kind
of
ciborium
to
protect
a
statue
of
the
prince
and
its
special
characteristic
was
that
the
ciborium
was
designed
in
some
degree
on
the
principles
of
the
ancient
shrines
these
shrines
were
models
of
imaginary
buildings
such
as
had
never
in
reality
been
erected
and
my
idea
was
to
realise
one
of
these
imaginary
structures
with
its
precious
materials
its
inlaying
its
enamels
etc
etc
his
idea
was
particularly
appropriate
since
it
chanced
that
a
similar
conception
though
in
the
reverse
order
of
magnitude
had
occurred
to
the
prince
himself
who
had
designed
and
executed
several
silver
upon
the
same
model
at
the
request
a
site
was
chosen
in
kensington
gardens
as
near
as
possible
to
that
of
the
great
exhibition
and
in
may
the
first
sod
was
turned
the
work
was
long
complicated
and
difficult
a
great
number
of
workmen
were
employed
besides
several
subsidiary
sculptors
and
metal
workers
under
scott
direction
while
at
every
stage
sketches
and
models
were
submitted
to
her
majesty
who
criticised
all
the
details
with
minute
care
and
constantly
suggested
improvements
the
frieze
which
encircled
the
base
of
the
monument
was
in
itself
a
very
serious
piece
of
work
this
said
scott
taken
as
a
whole
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
laborious
works
of
sculpture
ever
undertaken
consisting
as
it
does
of
a
continuous
range
of
of
the
most
elaborate
description
in
the
highest
of
of
more
than
feet
in
length
containing
about
figures
and
executed
in
the
hardest
marble
which
could
be
procured
after
three
years
of
toil
the
memorial
was
still
far
from
completion
and
scott
thought
it
advisable
to
give
a
dinner
to
the
workmen
as
a
substantial
recognition
of
his
appreciation
of
their
skill
and
energy
two
long
tables
we
are
told
constructed
of
scaffold
planks
were
arranged
in
the
workshops
and
covered
with
newspapers
for
want
of
upwards
of
eighty
men
sat
down
beef
and
mutton
plum
pudding
and
cheese
were
supplied
in
abundance
and
each
man
who
desired
it
had
three
pints
of
beer
gingerbeer
and
lemonade
being
provided
for
the
teetotalers
who
formed
a
very
considerable
proportion
several
toasts
were
given
and
many
of
the
workmen
spoke
almost
all
of
them
commencing
by
god
that
they
enjoyed
good
health
some
alluded
to
the
temperance
that
prevailed
amongst
them
others
observed
how
little
swearing
was
ever
heard
whilst
all
said
how
pleased
and
proud
they
were
to
be
engaged
on
so
great
a
work
gradually
the
edifice
approached
completion
the
one
hundred
and
seventieth
figure
in
the
frieze
was
chiselled
the
granite
pillars
arose
the
mosaics
were
inserted
in
the
allegorical
pediments
the
four
colossal
statues
representing
the
greater
christian
virtues
the
four
other
colossal
statues
representing
the
greater
moral
virtues
were
hoisted
into
their
positions
the
eight
bronzes
representing
the
greater
sciences
astronomy
chemistry
geology
geometry
rhetoric
medicine
philosophy
and
physiology
were
fixed
on
their
glittering
pinnacles
high
in
air
the
statue
of
physiology
was
particularly
admired
on
her
left
arm
the
official
description
informs
us
she
bears
a
infant
as
a
representation
of
the
development
of
the
highest
and
most
perfect
of
physiological
forms
her
hand
points
towards
a
microscope
the
instrument
which
lends
its
assistance
for
the
investigation
of
the
minuter
forms
of
animal
and
vegetable
organisms
at
last
the
gilded
cross
crowned
the
dwindling
galaxies
of
superimposed
angels
the
four
continents
in
white
marble
stood
at
the
four
corners
of
the
base
and
seven
years
after
its
inception
in
july
the
monument
was
thrown
open
to
the
public
but
four
more
years
were
to
elapse
before
the
central
figure
was
ready
to
be
placed
under
its
starry
canopy
it
was
designed
by
foley
though
in
one
particular
the
sculptor
freedom
was
restricted
by
scott
i
have
chosen
the
sitting
posture
scott
said
as
best
conveying
the
idea
of
dignity
befitting
a
royal
personage
foley
ably
carried
out
the
conception
of
his
principal

gladstone
and

together
in
the
limelight
victoria
from
her
post
of
vantage
watched
these
developments
with
that
passionate
and
personal
interest
which
she
invariably
imported
into
politics
her
prepossessions
were
of
an
unexpected
kind
gladstone
had
been
the
disciple
of
her
revered
peel
and
had
won
the
approval
of
albert
disraeli
had
hounded
sir
robert
to
his
fall
with
hideous
virulence
and
the
prince
had
pronounced
that
he
had
not
one
single
element
of
a
gentleman
in
his
composition
yet
she
regarded
gladstone
with
a
distrust
and
dislike
which
steadily
deepened
while
upon
his
rival
she
lavished
an
abundance
of
confidence
esteem
and
affection
such
as
lord
melbourne
himself
had
hardly
known
her
attitude
towards
the
tory
minister
had
suddenly
changed
when
she
found
that
he
alone
among
public
men
had
divined
her
feelings
at
albert
death
of
the
others
she
might
have
said
they
pity
me
and
not
my
grief
but
disraeli
had
understood
and
all
his
condolences
had
taken
the
form
of
reverential
eulogies
of
the
departed
the
queen
declared
that
he
was
the
only
person
who
appreciated
the
prince
she
began
to
show
him
special
favour
gave
him
and
his
wife
two
of
the
coveted
seats
in
george
chapel
at
the
prince
of
wales
wedding
and
invited
him
to
stay
a
night
at
windsor
when
the
grant
for
the
albert
memorial
came
before
the
house
of
commons
disraeli
as
leader
of
the
opposition
eloquently
supported
the
project
he
was
rewarded
by
a
copy
of
the
prince
speeches
bound
in
white
morocco
with
an
inscription
in
the
royal
hand
in
his
letter
of
thanks
he
ventured
to
touch
upon
a
sacred
theme
and
in
a
strain
which
with
masterly
fidelity
the
sentiments
of
his
correspondent
dwelt
at
length
upon
the
absolute
perfection
of
albert
the
prince
he
said
is
the
only
person
whom
disraeli
has
ever
known
who
realised
the
ideal
none
with
whom
he
is
acquainted
have
ever
approached
it
there
was
in
him
a
union
of
the
manly
grace
and
sublime
simplicity
of
chivalry
with
the
intellectual
splendour
of
the
attic
academe
the
only
character
in
english
history
that
would
in
some
respects
draw
near
to
him
is
sir
philip
sidney
the
same
high
tone
the
same
universal
accomplishments
the
same
blended
tenderness
and
vigour
the
same
rare
combination
of
romantic
energy
and
classic
repose
as
for
his
own
acquaintance
with
the
prince
it
had
been
he
said
one
of
the
most
satisfactory
incidents
of
his
life
full
of
refined
and
beautiful
memories
and
exercising
as
he
hopes
over
his
remaining
existence
a
soothing
and
exalting
influence
victoria
was
much
affected
by
the
depth
and
delicacy
of
these
touches
and
henceforward
disraeli
place
in
her
affections
was
assured
when
in
the
conservatives
came
into
office
disraeli
position
as
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
and
leader
of
the
house
necessarily
brought
him
into
a
closer
relation
with
the
sovereign
two
years
later
lord
derby
resigned
and
victoria
with
intense
delight
and
peculiar
graciousness
welcomed
disraeli
as
her
first
minister
but
only
for
nine
agitated
months
did
he
remain
in
power
the
ministry
in
a
minority
in
the
commons
was
swept
out
of
existence
by
a
general
election
yet
by
the
end
of
that
short
period
the
ties
which
bound
together
the
queen
and
her
premier
had
grown
far
stronger
than
ever
before
the
relationship
between
them
was
now
no
longer
merely
that
between
a
grateful
mistress
and
a
devoted
servant
they
were
friends
his
official
letters
in
which
the
personal
element
had
always
been
perceptible
developed
into
racy
records
of
political
news
and
social
gossip
written
as
lord
clarendon
said
in
his
best
novel
style
victoria
was
delighted
she
had
never
she
declared
had
such
letters
in
her
life
and
had
never
before
known
everything
in
return
she
sent
him
when
the
spring
came
several
bunches
of
flowers
picked
by
her
own
hands
he
despatched
to
her
a
set
of
his
novels
for
which
she
said
she
was
most
grateful
and
which
she
values
much
she
herself
had
lately
published
her
leaves
from
the
journal
of
our
life
in
the
highlands
and
it
was
observed
that
the
prime
minister
in
conversing
with
her
majesty
at
this
period
constantly
used
the
words
we
authors
upon
political
questions
she
was
his
staunch
supporter
really
there
never
was
such
conduct
as
that
of
the
opposition
she
wrote
and
when
the
government
was
defeated
in
the
house
she
was
really
shocked
at
the
way
in
which
the
house
of
commons
go
on
they
really
bring
discredit
on
constitutional
government
she
dreaded
the
prospect
of
a
change
she
feared
that
if
the
liberals
insisted
upon
disestablishing
the
irish
church
her
coronation
oath
might
stand
in
the
way
but
a
change
there
had
to
be
and
victoria
vainly
tried
to
console
herself
for
the
loss
of
her
favourite
minister
by
bestowing
a
peerage
upon
disraeli
gladstone
was
in
his
at
hawarden
cutting
down
a
tree
when
the
royal
message
was
brought
to
him
very
significant
he
remarked
when
he
had
read
the
letter
and
went
on
cutting
down
his
tree
his
secret
thoughts
on
the
occasion
were
more
explicit
and
were
committed
to
his
diary
the
almighty
he
wrote
seems
to
sustain
and
spare
me
for
some
purpose
of
his
own
deeply
unworthy
as
i
know
myself
to
be
glory
be
to
his
name
the
queen
however
did
not
share
her
new
minister
view
of
the
almighty
intentions
she
could
not
believe
that
there
was
any
divine
purpose
to
be
detected
in
the
programme
of
sweeping
changes
which
gladstone
was
determined
to
carry
out
but
what
could
she
do
gladstone
with
his
daemonic
energy
and
his
powerful
majority
in
the
house
of
commons
was
irresistible
and
for
five
years
victoria
found
herself
condemned
to
live
in
an
agitating
atmosphere
of
interminable
reform
reform
in
the
irish
church
and
the
irish
land
system
reform
in
education
reform
in
parliamentary
elections
reform
in
the
organisation
of
the
army
and
the
navy
reform
in
the
administration
of
justice
she
disapproved
she
struggled
she
grew
very
angry
she
felt
that
if
albert
had
been
living
things
would
never
have
happened
so
but
her
protests
and
her
complaints
were
alike
unavailing
the
mere
effort
of
grappling
with
the
mass
of
documents
which
poured
in
upon
her
in
an
flood
was
terribly
exhausting
when
the
draft
of
the
lengthy
and
intricate
irish
church
bill
came
before
her
accompanied
by
an
explanatory
letter
from
gladstone
covering
a
dozen
quarto
pages
she
almost
despaired
she
turned
from
the
bill
to
the
explanation
and
from
the
explanation
back
again
to
the
bill
and
she
could
not
decide
which
was
the
most
confusing
but
she
had
to
do
her
duty
she
had
not
only
to
read
but
to
make
notes
at
last
she
handed
the
whole
heap
of
papers
to
martin
who
happened
to
be
staying
at
osborne
and
requested
him
to
make
a
precis
of
them
when
he
had
done
so
her
disapproval
of
the
measure
became
more
marked
than
ever
but
such
was
the
strength
of
the
government
she
actually
found
herself
obliged
to
urge
moderation
upon
the
opposition
lest
worse
should
ensue
in
the
midst
of
this
crisis
when
the
future
of
the
irish
church
was
hanging
in
the
balance
victoria
attention
was
drawn
to
another
proposed
reform
it
was
suggested
that
the
sailors
in
the
navy
should
henceforward
be
allowed
to
wear
beards
has
childers
ascertained
anything
on
the
subject
of
the
beards
the
queen
wrote
anxiously
to
the
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
on
the
whole
her
majesty
was
in
favour
of
the
change
her
own
personal
feeling
she
wrote
would
be
for
the
beards
without
the
moustaches
as
the
latter
have
rather
a
soldierlike
appearance
but
then
the
object
in
view
would
not
be
obtained
viz
to
prevent
the
necessity
of
shaving
therefore
it
had
better
be
as
proposed
the
entire
beard
only
it
should
be
kept
short
and
very
clean
after
thinking
over
the
question
for
another
week
the
queen
wrote
a
final
letter
she
wished
she
said
to
make
one
additional
observation
respecting
the
beards
viz
that
on
no
account
should
moustaches
be
allowed
without
beards
that
must
be
clearly
understood
changes
in
the
navy
might
be
tolerated
to
lay
hands
upon
the
army
was
a
more
serious
matter
from
time
immemorial
there
had
been
a
particularly
close
connection
between
the
army
and
the
crown
and
albert
had
devoted
even
more
time
and
attention
to
the
details
of
military
business
than
to
the
processes
of
or
the
planning
of
sanitary
cottages
for
the
deserving
poor
but
now
there
was
to
be
a
great
alteration
gladstone
fiat
had
gone
forth
and
the
was
to
be
removed
from
his
direct
dependence
upon
the
sovereign
and
made
subordinate
to
parliament
and
the
secretary
of
state
for
war
of
all
the
liberal
reforms
this
was
the
one
which
aroused
the
bitterest
resentment
in
victoria
she
considered
that
the
change
was
an
attack
upon
her
personal
position
almost
an
attack
upon
the
personal
position
of
albert
but
she
was
helpless
and
the
prime
minister
had
his
way
when
she
heard
that
the
dreadful
man
had
yet
another
reform
in
contemplation
that
he
was
about
to
abolish
the
purchase
of
military
commissions
she
could
only
feel
that
it
was
just
what
might
have
been
expected
for
a
moment
she
hoped
that
the
house
of
lords
would
come
to
the
rescue
the
peers
opposed
the
change
with
unexpected
vigour
but
gladstone
more
conscious
than
ever
of
the
support
of
the
almighty
was
ready
with
an
ingenious
device
the
purchase
of
commissions
had
been
originally
allowed
by
royal
warrant
it
should
now
be
disallowed
by
the
same
agency
victoria
was
faced
by
a
curious
dilemma
she
abominated
the
abolition
of
purchase
but
she
was
asked
to
abolish
it
by
an
exercise
of
sovereign
power
which
was
very
much
to
her
taste
she
did
not
hesitate
for
long
and
when
the
cabinet
in
a
formal
minute
advised
her
to
sign
the
warrant
she
did
so
with
a
good
grace
unacceptable
as
gladstone
policy
was
there
was
something
else
about
him
which
was
even
more
displeasing
to
victoria
she
disliked
his
personal
demeanour
towards
herself
it
was
not
that
gladstone
in
his
intercourse
with
her
was
in
any
degree
lacking
in
courtesy
or
respect
on
the
contrary
an
extraordinary
reverence
impregnated
his
manner
both
in
his
conversation
and
his
correspondence
with
the
sovereign
indeed
with
that
deep
and
passionate
conservatism
which
to
the
very
end
of
his
incredible
career
gave
such
an
unexpected
colouring
to
his
inexplicable
character
gladstone
viewed
victoria
through
a
haze
of
awe
which
was
almost
religious
as
a
sacrosanct
embodiment
of
venerable
traditions
a
vital
element
in
the
british
constitution
a
queen
by
act
of
parliament
but
unfortunately
the
lady
did
not
appreciate
the
compliment
the
complaint
he
speaks
to
me
as
if
i
were
a
public
whether
authentic
or
no
and
the
turn
of
the
sentence
is
surely
a
little
too
epigrammatic
to
be
genuinely
victorian
undoubtedly
expresses
the
essential
element
of
her
antipathy
she
had
no
objection
to
being
considered
as
an
institution
she
was
one
and
she
knew
it
but
she
was
a
woman
too
and
to
be
considered
only
as
an
institution
that
was
unbearable
and
thus
all
gladstone
zeal
and
devotion
his
ceremonious
phrases
his
low
bows
his
punctilious
correctitudes
were
utterly
wasted
and
when
in
the
excess
of
his
loyalty
he
went
further
and
imputed
to
the
object
of
his
veneration
with
obsequious
blindness
the
subtlety
of
intellect
the
wide
reading
the
grave
enthusiasm
which
he
himself
possessed
the
misunderstanding
became
complete
the
discordance
between
the
actual
victoria
and
this
strange
divinity
made
in
gladstone
image
produced
disastrous
results
her
discomfort
and
dislike
turned
at
last
into
positive
animosity
and
though
her
manners
continued
to
be
perfect
she
never
for
a
moment
unbent
while
he
on
his
side
was
overcome
with
disappointment
perplexity
and
mortification
yet
his
fidelity
remained
unshaken
when
the
cabinet
met
the
prime
minister
filled
with
his
beatific
vision
would
open
the
proceedings
by
reading
aloud
the
letters
which
he
had
received
from
the
queen
upon
the
questions
of
the
hour
the
assembly
sat
in
absolute
silence
while
one
after
another
the
royal
missives
with
their
emphases
their
ejaculations
and
their
grammatical
peculiarities
boomed
forth
in
all
the
deep
solemnity
of
gladstone
utterance
not
a
single
comment
of
any
kind
was
ever
hazarded
and
after
a
fitting
pause
the
cabinet
proceeded
with
the
business
of
the
day
ii
little
as
victoria
appreciated
her
prime
minister
attitude
towards
her
she
found
that
it
had
its
uses
the
popular
discontent
at
her
uninterrupted
seclusion
had
been
gathering
force
for
many
years
and
now
burst
out
in
a
new
and
alarming
shape
republicanism
was
in
the
air
radical
opinion
in
england
stimulated
by
the
fall
of
napoleon
iii
and
the
establishment
of
a
republican
government
in
france
suddenly
grew
more
extreme
than
it
ever
had
been
since
it
also
became
for
the
first
time
almost
respectable
chartism
had
been
entirely
an
affair
of
the
lower
classes
but
now
members
of
parliament
learned
professors
and
ladies
of
title
openly
avowed
the
most
subversive
views
the
monarchy
was
attacked
both
in
theory
and
in
practice
and
it
was
attacked
at
a
vital
point
it
was
declared
to
be
too
expensive
what
benefits
it
was
asked
did
the
nation
reap
to
counterbalance
the
enormous
sums
which
were
expended
upon
the
sovereign
retirement
gave
an
unpleasant
handle
to
the
argument
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
ceremonial
functions
of
the
crown
had
virtually
lapsed
and
the
awkward
question
remained
whether
any
of
the
other
functions
which
it
did
continue
to
perform
were
really
worth
per
annum
the
royal
was
curiously
examined
an
anonymous
pamphlet
entitled
what
does
she
do
with
it
appeared
setting
forth
the
financial
position
with
malicious
clarity
the
queen
it
stated
was
granted
by
the
civil
list
a
year
for
her
private
use
but
the
rest
of
her
vast
annuity
was
given
as
the
act
declared
to
enable
her
to
defray
the
expenses
of
her
royal
household
and
to
support
the
honour
and
dignity
of
the
crown
now
it
was
obvious
that
since
the
death
of
the
prince
the
expenditure
for
both
these
purposes
must
have
been
very
considerably
diminished
and
it
was
difficult
to
resist
the
conclusion
that
a
large
sum
of
money
was
diverted
annually
from
the
uses
for
which
it
had
been
designed
by
parliament
to
swell
the
private
fortune
of
victoria
the
precise
amount
of
that
private
fortune
it
was
impossible
to
discover
but
there
was
reason
to
suppose
that
it
was
gigantic
perhaps
it
reached
a
total
of
five
million
pounds
the
pamphlet
protested
against
such
a
state
of
affairs
and
its
protests
were
repeated
vigorously
in
newspapers
and
at
public
meetings
though
it
is
certain
that
the
estimate
of
victoria
riches
was
much
exaggerated
it
is
equally
certain
that
she
was
an
exceedingly
wealthy
woman
she
probably
saved
a
year
from
the
civil
list
the
revenues
of
the
duchy
of
lancaster
were
steadily
increasing
she
had
inherited
a
considerable
property
from
the
prince
consort
and
she
had
been
left
in
an
estate
of
half
a
million
by
john
neild
an
eccentric
miser
in
these
circumstances
it
was
not
surprising
that
when
in
parliament
was
asked
to
vote
a
dowry
of
to
the
princess
louise
on
her
marriage
with
the
eldest
son
of
the
duke
of
argyle
together
with
an
annuity
of
there
should
have
been
a
serious
outcry
in
it
was
officially
stated
that
the
queen
total
savings
from
the
civil
list
amounted
to
but
that
out
of
this
sum
much
had
been
spent
on
special
entertainments
to
foreign
visitors
taking
into
consideration
the
proceeds
from
the
duchy
of
lancaster
which
were
more
than
a
year
the
savings
of
the
prince
consort
and
neild
legacy
it
seems
probable
that
at
the
time
of
her
death
victoria
private
fortune
approached
two
million
pounds
in
order
to
conciliate
public
opinion
the
queen
opened
parliament
in
person
and
the
vote
was
passed
almost
unanimously
but
a
few
months
later
another
demand
was
made
the
prince
arthur
had
come
of
age
and
the
nation
was
asked
to
grant
him
an
annuity
of
the
outcry
was
redoubled
the
newspapers
were
filled
with
angry
articles
bradlaugh
thundered
against
princely
paupers
to
one
of
the
largest
crowds
that
had
ever
been
seen
in
trafalgar
square
and
sir
charles
dilke
expounded
the
case
for
a
republic
in
a
speech
to
his
constituents
at
newcastle
the
prince
annuity
was
ultimately
sanctioned
in
the
house
of
commons
by
a
large
majority
but
a
minority
of
fifty
members
voted
in
favour
of
reducing
the
sum
to
towards
every
aspect
of
this
distasteful
question
gladstone
presented
an
iron
front
he
absolutely
discountenanced
the
extreme
section
of
his
followers
he
declared
that
the
whole
of
the
income
was
justly
at
her
personal
disposal
argued
that
to
complain
of
royal
savings
was
merely
to
encourage
royal
extravagance
and
successfully
convoyed
through
parliament
the
unpopular
annuities
which
he
pointed
out
were
strictly
in
accordance
with
precedent
when
in
sir
charles
dilke
once
more
returned
to
the
charge
in
the
house
of
commons
introducing
a
motion
for
a
full
enquiry
into
the
expenditure
with
a
view
to
a
root
and
branch
reform
of
the
civil
list
the
prime
minister
brought
all
the
resources
of
his
powerful
and
ingenious
eloquence
to
the
support
of
the
crown
he
was
completely
successful
and
amid
a
scene
of
great
disorder
the
motion
was
ignominiously
dismissed
victoria
was
relieved
but
she
grew
no
fonder
of
gladstone
it
was
perhaps
the
most
miserable
moment
of
her
life
the
ministers
the
press
the
public
all
conspired
to
vex
her
to
blame
her
to
misinterpret
her
actions
to
be
unsympathetic
and
disrespectful
in
every
way
she
was
a
cruelly
misunderstood
woman
she
told
martin
complaining
to
him
bitterly
of
the
unjust
attacks
which
were
made
upon
her
and
declaring
that
the
great
worry
and
anxiety
and
hard
work
for
ten
years
alone
unaided
with
increasing
age
and
never
very
strong
health
were
breaking
her
down
and
almost
drove
her
to
despair
the
situation
was
indeed
deplorable
it
seemed
as
if
her
whole
existence
had
gone
awry
as
if
an
irremediable
antagonism
had
grown
up
between
the
queen
and
the
nation
if
victoria
had
died
in
the
early
seventies
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
voice
of
the
world
would
have
pronounced
her
a
failure
iii
but
she
was
reserved
for
a
very
different
fate
the
outburst
of
republicanism
had
been
in
fact
the
last
flicker
of
an
expiring
cause
the
liberal
tide
which
had
been
flowing
steadily
ever
since
the
reform
bill
reached
its
height
with
gladstone
first
administration
and
towards
the
end
of
that
administration
the
inevitable
ebb
began
the
reaction
when
it
came
was
sudden
and
complete
the
general
election
of
changed
the
whole
face
of
politics
gladstone
and
the
liberals
were
routed
and
the
tory
party
for
the
first
time
for
over
forty
years
attained
an
unquestioned
supremacy
in
england
it
was
obvious
that
their
surprising
triumph
was
due
to
the
skill
and
vigour
of
disraeli
he
returned
to
office
no
longer
the
dubious
commander
of
an
insufficient
host
but
with
drums
beating
and
flags
flying
a
conquering
hero
and
as
a
conquering
hero
victoria
welcomed
her
new
prime
minister
then
there
followed
six
years
of
excitement
of
enchantment
of
felicity
of
glory
of
romance
the
amazing
being
who
now
at
last
at
the
age
of
seventy
after
a
lifetime
of
extraordinary
struggles
had
turned
into
reality
the
absurdest
of
his
boyhood
dreams
knew
well
enough
how
to
make
his
own
with
absolute
completeness
the
heart
of
the
sovereign
lady
whose
servant
and
whose
master
he
had
so
miraculously
become
in
women
hearts
he
had
always
read
as
in
an
open
book
his
whole
career
had
turned
upon
those
curious
entities
and
the
more
curious
they
were
the
more
intimately
at
home
with
them
he
seemed
to
be
but
lady
beaconsfield
with
her
cracked
idolatry
and
with
her
clogs
her
corpulence
and
her
legacy
were
gone
an
even
more
remarkable
phenomenon
stood
in
their
place
he
surveyed
what
was
before
him
with
the
eye
of
a
and
he
was
not
for
a
moment
at
a
loss
he
realised
everything
the
interacting
complexities
of
circumstance
and
character
the
pride
of
place
mingled
so
inextricably
with
personal
arrogance
the
superabundant
emotionalism
the
ingenuousness
of
outlook
the
solid
the
laborious
respectability
shot
through
so
incongruously
by
temperamental
cravings
for
the
coloured
and
the
strange
the
singular
intellectual
limitations
and
the
mysteriously
essential
female
elements
impregnating
every
particle
of
the
whole
a
smile
hovered
over
his
impassive
features
and
he
dubbed
victoria
the
faery
the
name
delighted
him
for
with
that
epigrammatic
ambiguity
so
dear
to
his
heart
it
precisely
expressed
his
vision
of
the
queen
the
spenserian
allusion
was
very
pleasant
the
elegant
evocations
of
gloriana
but
there
was
more
in
it
than
that
there
was
the
suggestion
of
a
diminutive
creature
endowed
with
magical
and
mythical
properties
and
a
portentousness
almost
ridiculously
out
of
keeping
with
the
rest
of
her
the
faery
he
determined
should
henceforward
wave
her
wand
for
him
alone
detachment
is
always
a
rare
quality
and
rarest
of
all
perhaps
among
politicians
but
that
veteran
egotist
possessed
it
in
a
supreme
degree
not
only
did
he
know
what
he
had
to
do
not
only
did
he
do
it
he
was
in
the
audience
as
well
as
on
the
stage
and
he
took
in
with
the
rich
relish
of
a
connoisseur
every
feature
of
the
entertaining
situation
every
phase
of
the
delicate
drama
and
every
detail
of
his
own
consummate
performance
the
smile
hovered
and
vanished
and
bowing
low
with
oriental
gravity
and
oriental
submissiveness
he
set
himself
to
his
task
he
had
understood
from
the
first
that
in
dealing
with
the
faery
the
appropriate
method
of
approach
was
the
very
antithesis
of
the
gladstonian
and
such
a
method
was
naturally
his
it
was
not
his
habit
to
harangue
and
exhort
and
expatiate
in
official
conscientiousness
he
liked
to
scatter
flowers
along
the
path
of
business
to
compress
a
weighty
argument
into
a
happy
phrase
to
insinuate
what
was
in
his
mind
with
an
air
of
friendship
and
confidential
courtesy
he
was
nothing
if
not
personal
and
he
had
perceived
that
personality
was
the
key
that
opened
the
faery
heart
accordingly
he
never
for
a
moment
allowed
his
intercourse
with
her
to
lose
the
personal
tone
he
invested
all
the
transactions
of
state
with
the
charms
of
familiar
conversation
she
was
always
the
royal
lady
the
adored
and
revered
mistress
he
the
devoted
and
respectful
friend
when
once
the
personal
relation
was
firmly
established
every
difficulty
disappeared
but
to
maintain
that
relation
uninterruptedly
in
a
smooth
and
even
course
a
particular
care
was
necessary
the
bearings
had
to
be
most
assiduously
oiled
nor
was
disraeli
in
any
doubt
as
to
the
nature
of
the
lubricant
you
have
heard
me
called
a
flatterer
he
said
to
matthew
arnold
and
it
is
true
everyone
likes
flattery
and
when
you
come
to
royalty
you
should
lay
it
on
with
a
trowel
he
practiced
what
he
preached
his
adulation
was
incessant
and
he
applied
it
in
the
very
thickest
slabs
there
is
no
honor
and
no
reward
he
declared
that
with
him
can
ever
equal
the
possession
of
your
majesty
kind
thoughts
all
his
own
thoughts
and
feelings
and
duties
and
affections
are
now
concentrated
in
your
majesty
and
he
desires
nothing
more
for
his
remaining
years
than
to
serve
your
majesty
or
if
that
service
ceases
to
live
still
on
its
memory
as
a
period
of
his
existence
most
interesting
and
fascinating
in
life
he
told
her
one
must
have
for
one
thoughts
a
sacred
depository
and
lord
beaconsfield
ever
presumes
to
seek
that
in
his
sovereign
mistress
she
was
not
only
his
own
solitary
support
she
was
the
one
prop
of
the
state
if
your
majesty
is
ill
he
wrote
during
a
grave
political
crisis
he
is
sure
he
will
himself
break
down
all
really
depends
upon
your
majesty
he
lives
only
for
her
he
asseverated
and
works
only
for
her
and
without
her
all
is
lost
when
her
birthday
came
he
produced
an
elaborate
confection
of
hyperbolic
compliment
lord
beaconsfield
ought
fitly
perhaps
to
congratulate
a
powerful
sovereign
on
her
imperial
sway
the
vastness
of
her
empire
and
the
success
and
strength
of
her
fleets
and
armies
but
he
can
not
his
mind
is
in
another
mood
he
can
only
think
of
the
strangeness
of
his
destiny
that
it
has
come
to
pass
that
he
should
be
the
servant
of
one
so
great
and
whose
infinite
kindness
the
brightness
of
whose
intelligence
and
the
firmness
of
whose
will
have
enabled
him
to
undertake
labours
to
which
he
otherwise
would
be
quite
unequal
and
supported
him
in
all
things
by
a
condescending
sympathy
which
in
the
hour
of
difficulty
alike
charms
and
inspires
upon
the
sovereign
of
many
lands
and
many
hearts
may
an
omnipotent
providence
shed
every
blessing
that
the
wise
can
desire
and
the
virtuous
deserve
in
those
expert
hands
the
trowel
seemed
to
assume
the
qualities
of
some
lofty
masonic
symbol
to
be
the
ornate
and
glittering
vehicle
of
verities
unrealised
by
the
profane
such
tributes
were
delightful
but
they
remained
in
the
nebulous
region
of
words
and
disraeli
had
determined
to
give
his
blandishments
a
more
significant
solidity
he
deliberately
encouraged
those
high
views
of
her
own
position
which
had
always
been
native
to
victoria
mind
and
had
been
reinforced
by
the
principles
of
albert
and
the
doctrines
of
stockmar
he
professed
to
a
belief
in
a
theory
of
the
constitution
which
gave
the
sovereign
a
leading
place
in
the
councils
of
government
but
his
pronouncements
upon
the
subject
were
indistinct
and
when
he
emphatically
declared
that
there
ought
to
be
a
real
throne
it
was
probably
with
the
mental
addition
that
that
throne
would
be
a
very
unreal
one
indeed
whose
occupant
was
unamenable
to
his
cajoleries
but
the
vagueness
of
his
language
was
in
itself
an
added
stimulant
to
victoria
skilfully
confusing
the
woman
and
the
queen
he
threw
with
a
grandiose
gesture
the
government
of
england
at
her
feet
as
if
in
doing
so
he
were
performing
an
act
of
personal
homage
in
his
first
audience
after
returning
to
power
he
assured
her
that
whatever
she
wished
should
be
done
when
the
intricate
public
worship
regulation
bill
was
being
discussed
by
the
cabinet
he
told
the
faery
that
his
only
object
was
to
further
your
majesty
wishes
in
this
matter
when
he
brought
off
his
great
coup
over
the
suez
canal
he
used
expressions
which
implied
that
the
only
gainer
by
the
transaction
was
victoria
it
is
just
settled
he
wrote
in
triumph
you
have
it
madam
four
millions
sterling
and
almost
immediately
there
was
only
one
firm
that
could
do
it
rothschilds
they
behaved
admirably
advanced
the
money
at
a
low
rate
and
the
entire
interest
of
the
khedive
is
now
yours
madam
nor
did
he
limit
himself
to
insinuations
writing
with
all
the
authority
of
his
office
he
advised
the
queen
that
she
had
the
constitutional
right
to
dismiss
a
ministry
which
was
supported
by
a
large
majority
in
the
house
of
commons
he
even
urged
her
to
do
so
if
in
her
opinion
your
majesty
government
have
from
wilfulness
or
even
from
weakness
deceived
your
majesty
to
the
horror
of
gladstone
he
not
only
kept
the
queen
informed
as
to
the
general
course
of
business
in
the
cabinet
but
revealed
to
her
the
part
taken
in
its
discussions
by
individual
members
of
it
lord
derby
the
son
of
the
late
prime
minister
and
disraeli
foreign
secretary
viewed
these
developments
with
grave
mistrust
is
there
not
he
ventured
to
write
to
his
chief
just
a
risk
of
encouraging
her
in
too
large
ideas
of
her
personal
power
and
too
great
indifference
to
what
the
public
expects
i
only
ask
it
is
for
you
to
judge
as
for
victoria
she
accepted
everything
compliments
flatteries
elizabethan
prerogatives
without
a
single
qualm
after
the
long
gloom
of
her
bereavement
after
the
chill
of
the
gladstonian
discipline
she
expanded
to
the
rays
of
disraeli
devotion
like
a
flower
in
the
sun
the
change
in
her
situation
was
indeed
miraculous
no
longer
was
she
obliged
to
puzzle
for
hours
over
the
complicated
details
of
business
for
now
she
had
only
to
ask
disraeli
for
an
explanation
and
he
would
give
it
her
in
the
most
concise
in
the
most
amusing
way
no
longer
was
she
worried
by
alarming
novelties
no
longer
was
she
put
out
at
finding
herself
treated
by
a
reverential
gentleman
in
high
collars
as
if
she
were
some
embodied
precedent
with
a
recondite
knowledge
of
greek
and
her
deliverer
was
surely
the
most
fascinating
of
men
the
strain
of
charlatanism
which
had
unconsciously
captivated
her
in
napoleon
iii
exercised
the
same
enchanting
effect
in
the
case
of
disraeli
like
a
whose
ordinary
life
is
passed
in
dull
sobriety
her
unsophisticated
intelligence
gulped
down
his
rococo
allurements
with
peculiar
zest
she
became
intoxicated
entranced
believing
all
that
he
told
her
of
herself
she
completely
regained
the
which
had
been
slipping
away
from
her
throughout
the
dark
period
that
followed
albert
death
she
swelled
with
a
new
elation
while
he
conjuring
up
before
her
wonderful
oriental
visions
dazzled
her
eyes
with
an
imperial
grandeur
of
which
she
had
only
dimly
dreamed
under
the
compelling
influence
her
very
demeanour
altered
her
short
stout
figure
with
its
folds
of
black
velvet
its
muslin
streamers
its
heavy
pearls
at
the
heavy
neck
assumed
an
almost
menacing
air
in
her
countenance
from
which
the
charm
of
youth
had
long
since
vanished
and
which
had
not
yet
been
softened
by
age
the
traces
of
grief
of
disappointment
and
of
displeasure
were
still
visible
but
they
were
overlaid
by
looks
of
arrogance
and
sharp
lines
of
peremptory
hauteur
only
when
disraeli
appeared
the
expression
changed
in
an
instant
and
the
forbidding
visage
became
charged
with
smiles
for
him
she
would
do
anything
yielding
to
his
encouragements
she
began
to
emerge
from
her
seclusion
she
appeared
in
london
in
at
hospitals
and
concerts
she
opened
parliament
she
reviewed
troops
and
distributed
medals
at
aldershot
but
such
public
signs
of
favour
were
trivial
in
comparison
with
her
private
attentions
during
his
flours
of
audience
she
could
hardly
restrain
her
excitement
and
delight
i
can
only
describe
my
reception
he
wrote
to
a
friend
on
one
occasion
by
telling
you
that
i
really
thought
she
was
going
to
embrace
me
she
was
wreathed
with
smiles
and
as
she
tattled
glided
about
the
room
like
a
bird
in
his
absence
she
talked
of
him
perpetually
and
there
was
a
note
of
unusual
vehemence
in
her
solicitude
for
his
health
john
manners
disraeli
told
lady
bradford
who
has
just
come
from
osborne
says
that
the
faery
only
talked
of
one
subject
and
that
was
her
primo
according
to
him
it
was
her
gracious
opinion
that
the
government
should
make
my
health
a
cabinet
question
dear
john
seemed
quite
surprised
at
what
she
said
but
you
are
used
to
these
ebullitions
she
often
sent
him
presents
an
illustrated
album
arrived
for
him
regularly
from
windsor
on
christmas
day
but
her
most
valued
gifts
were
the
bunches
of
spring
flowers
which
gathered
by
herself
and
her
ladies
in
the
woods
at
osborne
marked
in
an
especial
manner
the
warmth
and
tenderness
of
her
sentiments
among
these
it
was
he
declared
the
primroses
that
he
loved
the
best
they
were
he
said
the
ambassadors
of
spring
the
gems
and
jewels
of
nature
he
liked
them
he
assured
her
so
much
better
for
their
being
wild
they
seem
an
offering
from
the
fauns
and
dryads
of
osborne
they
show
he
told
her
that
your
majesty
sceptre
has
touched
the
enchanted
isle
he
sat
at
dinner
with
bowls
of
them
on
every
side
and
told
his
guests
that
they
were
all
sent
to
me
this
morning
by
the
queen
from
osborne
as
she
knows
it
is
my
favorite
flower
as
time
went
on
and
as
it
became
clearer
and
clearer
that
the
faery
thraldom
was
complete
his
protestations
grew
steadily
more
highly
coloured
and
more
unabashed
at
last
he
ventured
to
import
into
his
blandishments
a
strain
of
adoration
that
was
almost
avowedly
romantic
in
phrases
of
baroque
convolution
he
conveyed
the
message
of
his
heart
the
pressure
of
business
he
wrote
had
so
absorbed
and
exhausted
him
that
towards
the
hour
of
post
he
has
not
had
clearness
of
mind
and
vigour
of
pen
adequate
to
convey
his
thoughts
and
facts
to
the
most
loved
and
illustrious
being
who
deigns
to
consider
them
she
sent
him
some
primroses
and
he
replied
that
he
could
truly
say
they
are
precious
than
rubies
coming
as
they
do
and
at
such
a
moment
from
a
sovereign
whom
he
adores
she
sent
him
snowdrops
and
his
sentiment
overflowed
into
poetry
yesterday
eve
he
wrote
there
appeared
in
whitehall
gardens
a
case
with
a
royal
superscription
which
when
he
opened
he
thought
at
first
that
your
majesty
had
graciously
bestowed
upon
him
the
stars
of
your
principal
orders
and
indeed
he
was
so
impressed
with
this
graceful
illusion
that
having
a
banquet
where
there
were
many
stars
and
ribbons
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
by
placing
some
snowdrops
on
his
heart
of
showing
that
he
too
was
decorated
by
a
gracious
sovereign
then
in
the
middle
of
the
night
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
might
all
be
an
enchantment
and
that
perhaps
it
was
a
faery
gift
and
came
from
another
monarch
queen
titania
gathering
flowers
with
her
court
in
a
soft
and
isle
and
sending
magic
blossoms
which
they
say
turn
the
heads
of
those
who
receive
them
a
faery
gift
did
he
smile
as
he
wrote
the
words
perhaps
and
yet
it
would
be
rash
to
conclude
that
his
perfervid
declarations
were
altogether
without
sincerity
actor
and
spectator
both
the
two
characters
were
so
intimately
blended
together
in
that
odd
composition
that
they
formed
an
inseparable
unity
and
it
was
impossible
to
say
that
one
of
them
was
less
genuine
than
the
other
with
one
element
he
could
coldly
appraise
the
faery
intellectual
capacity
note
with
some
surprise
that
she
could
be
on
occasion
most
interesting
and
amusing
and
then
continue
his
use
of
the
trowel
with
an
ironical
solemnity
while
with
the
other
he
could
be
overwhelmed
by
the
immemorial
panoply
of
royalty
and
thrilling
with
the
sense
of
his
own
strange
elevation
dream
himself
into
a
gorgeous
phantasy
of
crowns
and
powers
and
chivalric
love
when
he
told
victoria
that
during
a
somewhat
romantic
and
imaginative
life
nothing
has
ever
occurred
to
him
so
interesting
as
this
confidential
correspondence
with
one
so
exalted
and
so
inspiring
was
he
not
in
earnest
after
all
when
he
wrote
to
a
lady
about
the
court
i
love
the
queen
perhaps
the
only
person
in
this
world
left
to
me
that
i
do
love
was
he
not
creating
for
himself
an
enchanted
palace
out
of
the
arabian
nights
full
of
melancholy
and
spangles
in
which
he
actually
believed
victoria
state
of
mind
was
far
more
simple
untroubled
by
imaginative
yearnings
she
never
lost
herself
in
that
nebulous
region
of
the
spirit
where
feeling
and
fancy
grow
confused
her
emotions
with
all
their
intensity
and
all
their
exaggeration
retained
the
plain
prosaic
texture
of
everyday
life
and
it
was
fitting
that
her
expression
of
them
should
be
equally
commonplace
she
was
she
told
her
prime
minister
at
the
end
of
an
official
letter
yours
and
i
in
such
a
phrase
the
deep
reality
of
her
feeling
is
instantly
manifest
the
faery
feet
were
on
the
solid
earth
it
was
the
ruse
cynic
who
was
in
the
air
he
had
taught
her
however
a
lesson
which
she
had
learnt
with
alarming
rapidity
a
second
gloriana
did
he
call
her
very
well
then
she
would
show
that
she
deserved
the
compliment
disquieting
symptoms
followed
fast
in
may
the
tsar
whose
daughter
had
just
been
married
to
victoria
second
son
the
duke
of
edinburgh
was
in
london
and
by
an
unfortunate
error
it
had
been
arranged
that
his
departure
should
not
take
place
until
two
days
after
the
date
on
which
his
royal
hostess
had
previously
decided
to
go
to
balmoral
her
majesty
refused
to
modify
her
plans
it
was
pointed
out
to
her
that
the
tsar
would
certainly
be
offended
that
the
most
serious
consequences
might
follow
lord
derby
protested
lord
salisbury
the
secretary
of
state
for
india
was
much
perturbed
but
the
faery
was
unconcerned
she
had
settled
to
go
to
balmoral
on
the
and
on
the
she
would
go
at
last
disraeli
exercising
all
his
influence
induced
her
to
agree
to
stay
in
london
for
two
days
more
my
head
is
still
on
my
shoulders
he
told
lady
bradford
the
great
lady
has
absolutely
postponed
her
departure
everybody
had
failed
even
the
prince
of
wales
and
i
have
no
doubt
i
am
not
in
favour
i
ca
help
it
salisbury
says
i
have
saved
an
afghan
war
and
derby
compliments
me
on
my
unrivalled
triumph
but
before
very
long
on
another
issue
the
triumph
was
the
faery
disraeli
who
had
suddenly
veered
towards
a
new
imperialism
had
thrown
out
the
suggestion
that
the
queen
of
england
ought
to
become
the
empress
of
india
victoria
seized
upon
the
idea
with
avidity
and
in
season
and
out
of
season
pressed
upon
her
prime
minister
the
desirability
of
putting
his
proposal
into
practice
he
demurred
but
she
was
not
to
be
baulked
and
in
in
spite
of
his
own
unwillingness
and
that
of
his
entire
cabinet
he
found
himself
obliged
to
add
to
the
troubles
of
a
stormy
session
by
introducing
a
bill
for
the
alteration
of
the
royal
title
his
compliance
however
finally
conquered
the
faery
heart
the
measure
was
angrily
attacked
in
both
houses
and
victoria
was
deeply
touched
by
the
untiring
energy
with
which
disraeli
defended
it
she
was
she
said
much
grieved
by
the
worry
and
annoyance
to
which
he
was
subjected
she
feared
she
was
the
cause
of
it
and
she
would
never
forget
what
she
owed
to
her
kind
good
and
considerate
friend
at
the
same
time
her
wrath
fell
on
the
opposition
their
conduct
she
declared
was
extraordinary
incomprehensible
and
mistaken
and
in
an
emphatic
sentence
which
seemed
to
contradict
both
itself
and
all
her
former
proceedings
she
protested
that
she
would
be
glad
if
it
were
more
generally
known
that
it
was
her
wish
as
people
will
have
it
that
it
has
been
forced
upon
her
when
the
affair
was
successfully
over
the
imperial
triumph
was
celebrated
in
a
suitable
manner
on
the
day
of
the
delhi
proclamation
the
new
earl
of
beaconsfield
went
to
windsor
to
dine
with
the
new
empress
of
india
that
night
the
faery
usually
so
homely
in
her
attire
appeared
in
a
glittering
panoply
of
enormous
uncut
jewels
which
had
been
presented
to
her
by
the
reigning
princes
of
her
raj
at
the
end
of
the
meal
the
prime
minister
breaking
through
the
rules
of
etiquette
arose
and
in
a
flowery
oration
proposed
the
health
of
the
his
audacity
was
well
received
and
his
speech
was
rewarded
by
a
smiling
curtsey
these
were
significant
episodes
but
a
still
more
serious
manifestation
of
victoria
temper
occurred
in
the
following
year
during
the
crowning
crisis
of
beaconsfield
life
his
growing
imperialism
his
desire
to
magnify
the
power
and
prestige
of
england
his
insistence
upon
a
spirited
foreign
policy
had
brought
him
into
collision
with
russia
the
terrible
eastern
question
loomed
up
and
when
war
broke
out
between
russia
and
turkey
the
gravity
of
the
situation
became
extreme
the
prime
minister
policy
was
fraught
with
difficulty
and
danger
realising
perfectly
the
appalling
implications
of
an
war
he
was
yet
prepared
to
face
even
that
eventuality
if
he
could
obtain
his
ends
by
no
other
method
but
he
believed
that
russia
in
reality
was
still
less
desirous
of
a
rupture
and
that
if
he
played
his
game
with
sufficient
boldness
and
adroitness
she
would
yield
when
it
came
to
the
point
all
that
he
required
without
a
blow
it
was
clear
that
the
course
he
had
marked
out
for
himself
was
full
of
hazard
and
demanded
an
extraordinary
nerve
a
single
false
step
and
either
himself
or
england
might
be
plunged
in
disaster
but
nerve
he
had
never
lacked
he
began
his
diplomatic
with
high
assurance
and
then
he
discovered
that
besides
the
russian
government
besides
the
liberals
and
gladstone
there
were
two
additional
sources
of
perilous
embarrassment
with
which
he
would
have
to
reckon
in
the
first
place
there
was
a
strong
party
in
the
cabinet
headed
by
lord
derby
the
foreign
secretary
which
was
unwilling
to
take
the
risk
of
war
but
his
culminating
anxiety
was
the
faery
from
the
first
her
attitude
was
uncompromising
the
old
hatred
of
russia
which
had
been
engendered
by
the
crimean
war
surged
up
again
within
her
she
remembered
albert
prolonged
animosity
she
felt
the
prickings
of
her
own
greatness
and
she
flung
herself
into
the
turmoil
with
passionate
heat
her
indignation
with
the
opposition
with
anyone
who
ventured
to
sympathise
with
the
russians
in
their
quarrel
with
the
turks
was
unbounded
when
meetings
were
held
in
london
presided
over
by
the
duke
of
westminster
and
lord
shaftesbury
and
attended
by
gladstone
and
other
prominent
radicals
she
considered
that
the
ought
to
be
set
at
these
men
it
ca
she
exclaimed
be
constitutional
never
in
her
life
not
even
in
the
crisis
over
the
ladies
of
the
bedchamber
did
she
show
herself
a
more
furious
partisan
but
her
displeasure
was
not
reserved
for
the
radicals
the
backsliding
conservatives
equally
felt
its
force
she
was
even
discontented
with
lord
beaconsfield
himself
failing
entirely
to
appreciate
the
delicate
complexity
of
his
policy
she
constantly
assailed
him
with
demands
for
vigorous
action
interpreted
each
finesse
as
a
sign
of
weakness
and
was
ready
at
every
juncture
to
let
slip
the
dogs
of
war
as
the
situation
developed
her
anxiety
grew
feverish
the
queen
she
wrote
is
feeling
terribly
anxious
lest
delay
should
cause
us
to
be
too
late
and
lose
our
prestige
for
ever
it
worries
her
night
and
day
the
faery
beaconsfield
told
lady
bradford
writes
every
day
and
telegraphs
every
hour
this
is
almost
literally
the
case
she
raged
loudly
against
the
russians
and
the
language
she
cried
the
insulting
language
used
by
the
russians
against
us
it
makes
the
queen
blood
boil
oh
she
wrote
a
little
later
if
the
queen
were
a
man
she
would
like
to
go
and
give
those
russians
whose
word
one
can
not
believe
such
a
beating
we
shall
never
be
friends
again
till
we
have
it
out
this
the
queen
feels
sure
of
the
unfortunate
prime
minister
urged
on
to
violence
by
victoria
on
one
side
had
to
deal
on
the
other
with
a
foreign
secretary
who
was
fundamentally
opposed
to
any
policy
of
active
interference
at
all
between
the
queen
and
lord
derby
he
held
a
harassed
course
he
gained
indeed
some
slight
satisfaction
in
playing
on
the
one
against
the
other
in
stimulating
lord
derby
with
the
queen
missives
and
in
appeasing
the
queen
by
repudiating
lord
derby
opinions
on
one
occasion
he
actually
went
so
far
as
to
compose
at
victoria
request
a
letter
bitterly
attacking
his
colleague
which
her
majesty
forthwith
signed
and
sent
without
alteration
to
the
foreign
secretary
but
such
devices
only
gave
a
temporary
relief
and
it
soon
became
evident
that
victoria
martial
ardour
was
not
to
be
sidetracked
by
hostilities
against
lord
derby
hostilities
against
russia
were
what
she
wanted
what
she
would
what
she
must
have
for
now
casting
aside
the
last
relics
of
moderation
she
began
to
attack
her
friend
with
a
series
of
extraordinary
threats
not
once
not
twice
but
many
times
she
held
over
his
head
the
formidable
menace
of
her
imminent
abdication
if
england
she
wrote
to
beaconsfield
is
to
kiss
russia
feet
she
will
not
be
a
party
to
the
humiliation
of
england
and
would
lay
down
her
crown
and
she
added
that
the
prime
minister
might
if
he
thought
fit
repeat
her
words
to
the
cabinet
this
delay
she
ejaculated
this
uncertainty
by
which
abroad
we
are
losing
our
prestige
and
our
position
while
russia
is
advancing
and
will
be
before
constantinople
in
no
time
then
the
government
will
be
fearfully
blamed
and
the
queen
so
humiliated
that
she
thinks
she
would
abdicate
at
once
be
bold
she
feels
she
reiterated
she
can
not
as
she
before
said
remain
the
sovereign
of
a
country
that
is
letting
itself
down
to
kiss
the
feet
of
the
great
barbarians
the
retarders
of
all
liberty
and
civilisation
that
exists
when
the
russians
advanced
to
the
outskirts
of
constantinople
she
fired
off
three
letters
in
a
day
demanding
war
and
when
she
learnt
that
the
cabinet
had
only
decided
to
send
the
fleet
to
gallipoli
she
declared
that
her
first
impulse
was
to
lay
down
the
thorny
crown
which
she
feels
little
satisfaction
in
retaining
if
the
position
of
this
country
is
to
remain
as
it
is
now
it
is
easy
to
imagine
the
agitating
effect
of
such
a
correspondence
upon
beaconsfield
this
was
no
longer
the
faery
it
was
a
genie
whom
he
had
rashly
called
out
of
her
bottle
and
who
was
now
intent
upon
showing
her
supernal
power
more
than
once
perplexed
dispirited
shattered
by
illness
he
had
thoughts
of
withdrawing
altogether
from
the
game
one
thing
alone
he
told
lady
bradford
with
a
wry
smile
prevented
him
if
i
could
only
he
wrote
face
the
scene
which
would
occur
at
headquarters
if
i
resigned
i
would
do
so
at
once
he
held
on
however
to
emerge
victorious
at
last
the
queen
was
pacified
lord
derby
was
replaced
by
lord
salisbury
and
at
the
congress
of
berlin
der
alte
jude
carried
all
before
him
he
returned
to
england
in
triumph
and
assured
the
delighted
victoria
that
she
would
very
soon
be
if
she
was
not
already
the
dictatress
of
europe
but
soon
there
was
an
unexpected
reverse
at
the
general
election
of
the
country
mistrustful
of
the
forward
policy
of
the
conservatives
and
carried
away
by
gladstone
oratory
returned
the
liberals
to
power
victoria
was
horrified
but
within
a
year
she
was
to
be
yet
more
nearly
hit
the
grand
romance
had
come
to
its
conclusion
lord
beaconsfield
worn
out
with
age
and
maladies
but
moving
still
an
assiduous
mummy
from
to
suddenly
moved
no
longer
when
she
knew
that
the
end
was
inevitable
she
seemed
by
a
pathetic
instinct
to
divest
herself
of
her
royalty
and
to
shrink
with
hushed
gentleness
beside
him
a
woman
and
nothing
more
i
send
some
osborne
primroses
she
wrote
to
him
with
touching
simplicity
and
i
meant
to
pay
you
a
little
visit
this
week
but
i
thought
it
better
you
should
be
quite
quiet
and
not

you
will
be

good
and

the
doctors
she
would
see
him
she
said
when
we
come
back
from
osborne
which
wo
be
long
everyone
is
so
distressed
at
your
not
being
well
she
added
and
she
was
ever
yours
very
when
the
royal
letter
was
given
him
the
strange
old
comedian
stretched
on
his
bed
of
death
poised
it
in
his
hand
appeared
to
consider
deeply
and
then
whispered
to
those
about
him
this
ought
to
be
read
to
me
by
a
privy
councillor
chapter
ix
old
age
i
meanwhile
in
victoria
private
life
many
changes
and
developments
had
taken
place
with
the
marriages
of
her
elder
children
her
family
circle
widened
grandchildren
appeared
and
a
multitude
of
new
domestic
interests
sprang
up
the
death
of
king
leopold
in
had
removed
the
predominant
figure
of
the
older
generation
and
the
functions
he
had
performed
as
the
centre
and
adviser
of
a
large
group
of
relatives
in
germany
and
in
england
devolved
upon
victoria
these
functions
she
discharged
with
unremitting
industry
carrying
on
an
enormous
correspondence
and
following
with
absorbed
interest
every
detail
in
the
lives
of
the
cousinhood
and
she
tasted
to
the
full
both
the
joys
and
the
pains
of
family
affection
she
took
a
particular
delight
in
her
grandchildren
to
whom
she
showed
an
indulgence
which
their
parents
had
not
always
enjoyed
though
even
to
her
grandchildren
she
could
be
when
the
occasion
demanded
it
severe
the
eldest
of
them
the
little
prince
wilhelm
of
prussia
was
a
remarkably
headstrong
child
he
dared
to
be
impertinent
even
to
his
grandmother
and
once
when
she
told
him
to
bow
to
a
visitor
at
osborne
he
disobeyed
her
outright
this
would
not
do
the
order
was
sternly
repeated
and
the
naughty
boy
noticing
that
his
grandmama
had
suddenly
turned
into
a
most
terrifying
lady
submitted
his
will
to
hers
and
bowed
very
low
indeed
it
would
have
been
well
if
all
the
queen
domestic
troubles
could
have
been
got
over
as
easily
among
her
more
serious
distresses
was
the
conduct
of
the
prince
of
wales
the
young
man
was
now
independent
and
married
he
had
shaken
the
parental
yoke
from
his
shoulders
he
was
positively
beginning
to
do
as
he
liked
victoria
was
much
perturbed
and
her
worst
fears
seemed
to
be
justified
when
in
he
appeared
as
a
witness
in
a
society
divorce
case
it
was
clear
that
the
heir
to
the
throne
had
been
mixing
with
people
of
whom
she
did
not
at
all
approve
what
was
to
be
done
she
saw
that
it
was
not
only
her
son
that
was
to
blame
that
it
was
the
whole
system
of
society
and
so
she
despatched
a
letter
to
delane
the
editor
of
the
times
asking
him
if
he
would
frequently
write
articles
pointing
out
the
immense
danger
and
evil
of
the
wretched
frivolity
and
levity
of
the
views
and
lives
of
the
higher
classes
and
five
years
later
delane
did
write
an
article
upon
that
very
subject
yet
it
seemed
to
have
very
little
effect
ah
if
only
the
higher
classes
would
learn
to
live
as
she
lived
in
the
domestic
sobriety
of
her
sanctuary
at
balmoral
for
more
and
more
did
she
find
solace
and
refreshment
in
her
highland
domain
and
twice
yearly
in
the
spring
and
in
the
autumn
with
a
sigh
of
relief
she
set
her
face
northwards
in
spite
of
the
humble
protests
of
ministers
who
murmured
vainly
in
the
royal
ears
that
to
transact
the
affairs
of
state
over
an
interval
of
six
hundred
miles
added
considerably
to
the
cares
of
government
her
ladies
too
felt
occasionally
a
slight
reluctance
to
set
out
for
especially
in
the
early
days
the
long
pilgrimage
was
not
without
its
drawbacks
for
many
years
the
queen
conservatism
forbade
the
continuation
of
the
railway
up
deeside
so
that
the
last
stages
of
the
journey
had
to
be
accomplished
in
carriages
but
after
all
carriages
had
their
good
points
they
were
easy
for
instance
to
get
in
and
out
of
which
was
an
important
consideration
for
the
royal
train
remained
for
long
immune
from
modern
conveniences
and
when
it
drew
up
on
some
border
moorland
far
from
any
platform
the
highbred
dames
were
obliged
to
descend
to
earth
by
the
perilous
the
only
pair
of
folding
steps
being
reserved
for
her
majesty
saloon
in
the
days
of
crinolines
such
moments
were
sometimes
awkward
and
it
was
occasionally
necessary
to
summon
johnstone
the
short
and
sturdy
manager
of
the
caledonian
railway
who
more
than
once
in
a
high
gale
and
drenching
rain
with
great
difficulty
pushed
up
as
he
himself
described
it
some
unlucky
lady
blanche
or
lady
agatha
into
her
compartment
but
victoria
cared
for
none
of
these
things
she
was
only
intent
upon
regaining
with
the
utmost
swiftness
her
enchanted
castle
where
every
spot
was
charged
with
memories
where
every
memory
was
sacred
and
where
life
was
passed
in
an
incessant
and
delightful
round
of
absolutely
trivial
events
and
it
was
not
only
the
place
that
she
loved
she
was
equally
attached
to
the
simple
mountaineers
from
whom
she
said
she
learnt
many
a
lesson
of
resignation
and
faith
smith
and
grant
and
ross
and
thompson
she
was
devoted
to
them
all
but
beyond
the
rest
she
was
devoted
to
john
brown
the
prince
gillie
had
now
become
the
personal
attendant
a
body
servant
from
whom
she
was
never
parted
who
accompanied
her
on
her
drives
waited
on
her
during
the
day
and
slept
in
a
neighbouring
chamber
at
night
she
liked
his
strength
his
solidity
the
sense
he
gave
her
of
physical
security
she
even
liked
his
rugged
manners
and
his
rough
unaccommodating
speech
she
allowed
him
to
take
liberties
with
her
which
would
have
been
unthinkable
from
anybody
else
to
bully
the
queen
to
order
her
about
to
reprimand
her
who
could
dream
of
venturing
upon
such
audacities
and
yet
when
she
received
such
treatment
from
john
brown
she
positively
seemed
to
enjoy
it
the
eccentricity
appeared
to
be
extraordinary
but
after
all
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
for
an
autocratic
dowager
to
allow
some
trusted
indispensable
servant
to
adopt
towards
her
an
attitude
of
authority
which
is
jealously
forbidden
to
relatives
or
friends
the
power
of
a
dependent
still
remains
by
a
psychological
one
own
power
even
when
it
is
exercised
over
oneself
when
victoria
meekly
obeyed
the
abrupt
commands
of
her
henchman
to
get
off
her
pony
or
put
on
her
shawl
was
she
not
displaying
and
in
the
highest
degree
the
force
of
her
volition
people
might
wonder
she
could
not
help
that
this
was
the
manner
in
which
it
pleased
her
to
act
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
to
have
submitted
her
judgment
to
a
son
or
a
minister
might
have
seemed
wiser
or
more
natural
but
if
she
had
done
so
she
instinctively
felt
she
would
indeed
have
lost
her
independence
and
yet
upon
somebody
she
longed
to
depend
her
days
were
heavy
with
the
long
process
of
domination
as
she
drove
in
silence
over
the
moors
she
leaned
back
in
the
carriage
oppressed
and
weary
but
what
a
relief
john
brown
was
behind
on
the
rumble
and
his
strong
arm
would
be
there
for
her
to
lean
upon
when
she
got
out
he
had
too
in
her
mind
a
special
connection
with
albert
in
their
expeditions
the
prince
had
always
trusted
him
more
than
anyone
the
gruff
kind
hairy
scotsman
was
she
felt
in
some
mysterious
way
a
legacy
from
the
dead
she
came
to
believe
at
last
or
so
it
appeared
that
the
spirit
of
albert
was
nearer
when
brown
was
near
often
when
seeking
inspiration
over
some
complicated
question
of
political
or
domestic
import
she
would
gaze
with
deep
concentration
at
her
late
husband
bust
but
it
was
also
noticed
that
sometimes
in
such
moments
of
doubt
and
hesitation
her
majesty
looks
would
fix
themselves
upon
john
brown
eventually
the
simple
mountaineer
became
almost
a
state
personage
the
influence
which
he
wielded
was
not
to
be
overlooked
lord
beaconsfield
was
careful
from
time
to
time
to
send
courteous
messages
to
brown
in
his
letters
to
the
queen
and
the
french
government
took
particular
pains
to
provide
for
his
comfort
during
the
visits
of
the
english
sovereign
to
france
it
was
only
natural
that
among
the
elder
members
of
the
royal
family
he
should
not
have
been
popular
and
that
his
failings
for
failings
he
had
though
victoria
would
never
notice
his
too
acute
appreciation
of
scotch
whisky
should
have
been
the
subject
of
acrimonious
comment
at
court
but
he
served
his
mistress
faithfully
and
to
ignore
him
would
be
a
sign
of
disrespect
to
her
biographer
for
the
queen
far
from
making
a
secret
of
her
affectionate
friendship
took
care
to
publish
it
to
the
world
by
her
orders
two
gold
medals
were
struck
in
his
honour
on
his
death
in
a
long
and
eulogistic
obituary
notice
of
him
appeared
in
the
court
circular
and
a
brown
memorial
brooch
of
gold
with
the
late
gillie
head
on
one
side
and
the
royal
monogram
on
the
other
was
designed
by
her
majesty
for
presentation
to
her
highland
servants
and
cottagers
to
be
worn
by
them
on
the
anniversary
of
his
death
with
a
mourning
scarf
and
pins
in
the
second
series
of
extracts
from
the
queen
highland
journal
published
in
her
devoted
personal
attendant
and
faithful
friend
appears
upon
almost
every
page
and
is
in
effect
the
hero
of
the
book
with
an
absence
of
reticence
remarkable
in
royal
persons
victoria
seemed
to
demand
in
this
private
and
delicate
matter
the
sympathy
of
the
whole
nation
and
yet
such
is
the
world
there
were
those
who
actually
treated
the
relations
between
their
sovereign
and
her
servant
as
a
theme
for
ribald
jests
ii
the
busy
years
hastened
away
the
traces
of
time
unimaginable
touch
grew
manifest
and
old
age
approaching
laid
a
gentle
hold
upon
victoria
the
grey
hair
whitened
the
mature
features
mellowed
the
short
firm
figure
amplified
and
moved
more
slowly
supported
by
a
stick
and
simultaneously
in
the
whole
tenour
of
the
queen
existence
an
extraordinary
transformation
came
to
pass
the
nation
attitude
towards
her
critical
and
even
hostile
as
it
had
been
for
so
many
years
altogether
changed
while
there
was
a
corresponding
alteration
in
the
temper
of
victoria
own
mind
many
causes
led
to
this
result
among
them
were
the
repeated
strokes
of
personal
misfortune
which
befell
the
queen
during
a
cruelly
short
space
of
years
in
the
princess
alice
who
had
married
in
the
prince
louis
of
died
in
tragic
circumstances
in
the
following
year
the
prince
imperial
the
only
son
of
the
empress
eugenie
to
whom
victoria
since
the
catastrophe
of
had
become
devotedly
attached
was
killed
in
the
zulu
war
two
years
later
in
the
queen
lost
lord
beaconsfield
and
in
john
brown
in
the
prince
leopold
duke
of
albany
who
had
been
an
invalid
from
birth
died
prematurely
shortly
after
his
marriage
victoria
cup
of
sorrows
was
indeed
overflowing
and
the
public
as
it
watched
the
widowed
mother
weeping
for
her
children
and
her
friends
displayed
a
constantly
increasing
sympathy
an
event
which
occurred
in
revealed
and
accentuated
the
feelings
of
the
nation
as
the
queen
at
windsor
was
walking
from
the
train
to
her
carriage
a
youth
named
roderick
maclean
fired
a
pistol
at
her
from
a
distance
of
a
few
yards
an
eton
boy
struck
up
maclean
arm
with
an
umbrella
before
the
pistol
went
off
no
damage
was
done
and
the
culprit
was
at
once
arrested
this
was
the
last
of
a
series
of
seven
attempts
upon
the
queen
attempts
which
taking
place
at
sporadic
intervals
over
a
period
of
forty
years
resembled
one
another
in
a
curious
manner
all
with
a
single
exception
were
perpetrated
by
adolescents
whose
motives
were
apparently
not
murderous
since
save
in
the
case
of
maclean
none
of
their
pistols
was
loaded
these
unhappy
youths
who
after
buying
their
cheap
weapons
stuffed
them
with
gunpowder
and
paper
and
then
went
off
with
the
certainty
of
immediate
detection
to
click
them
in
the
face
of
royalty
present
a
strange
problem
to
the
psychologist
but
though
in
each
case
their
actions
and
their
purposes
seemed
to
be
so
similar
their
fates
were
remarkably
varied
the
first
of
them
edward
oxford
who
fired
at
victoria
within
a
few
months
of
her
marriage
was
tried
for
high
treason
declared
to
be
insane
and
sent
to
an
asylum
for
life
it
appears
however
that
this
sentence
did
not
commend
itself
to
albert
for
when
two
years
later
john
francis
committed
the
same
of
fence
and
was
tried
upon
the
same
charge
the
prince
propounced
that
there
was
no
insanity
in
the
matter
the
wretched
creature
he
told
his
father
was
not
out
of
his
mind
but
a
thorough
scamp
i
hope
he
added
his
trial
will
be
conducted
with
the
greatest
strictness
apparently
it
was
at
any
rate
the
jury
shared
the
view
of
the
prince
the
plea
of
insanity
was
set
aside
and
francis
was
found
guilty
of
high
treason
and
condemned
to
death
but
as
there
was
no
proof
of
an
intent
to
kill
or
even
to
wound
this
sentence
after
a
lengthened
deliberation
between
the
home
secretary
and
the
judges
was
commuted
for
one
of
transportation
for
life
as
the
law
stood
these
assaults
futile
as
they
were
could
only
be
treated
as
high
treason
the
discrepancy
between
the
actual
deed
and
the
tremendous
penalties
involved
was
obviously
grotesque
and
it
was
besides
clear
that
a
jury
knowing
that
a
verdict
of
guilty
implied
a
sentence
of
death
would
tend
to
the
alternative
course
and
find
the
prisoner
not
guilty
but
insane
a
conclusion
which
on
the
face
of
it
would
have
appeared
to
be
the
more
reasonable
in
therefore
an
act
was
passed
making
any
attempt
to
hurt
the
queen
a
misdemeanor
punishable
by
transportation
for
seven
years
or
imprisonment
with
or
without
hard
labour
for
a
term
not
exceeding
three
years
the
misdemeanant
at
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
be
publicly
or
privately
whipped
as
often
and
in
such
manner
and
form
as
the
court
shall
direct
not
exceeding
thrice
the
four
subsequent
attempts
were
all
dealt
with
under
this
new
law
william
bean
in
was
sentenced
to
eighteen
months
imprisonment
william
hamilton
in
was
transported
for
seven
years
and
in
the
same
sentence
was
passed
upon
lieutenant
robert
pate
who
struck
the
queen
on
the
head
with
his
cane
in
piccadilly
pate
alone
among
these
delinquents
was
of
mature
years
he
had
held
a
commission
in
the
army
dressed
himself
as
a
dandy
and
was
the
prince
declared
manifestly
deranged
in
arthur
a
youth
of
seventeen
fired
an
unloaded
pistol
at
the
queen
outside
buckingham
palace
he
was
immediately
seized
by
john
brown
and
sentenced
to
one
imprisonment
and
twenty
strokes
of
the
birch
rod
it
was
for
his
bravery
upon
this
occasion
that
brown
was
presented
with
one
of
his
gold
medals
in
all
these
cases
the
jury
had
refused
to
allow
the
plea
of
insanity
but
roderick
maclean
attempt
in
had
a
different
issue
on
this
occasion
the
pistol
was
found
to
have
been
loaded
and
the
public
indignation
emphasised
as
it
was
by
victoria
growing
popularity
was
particularly
great
either
for
this
or
for
some
other
reason
the
procedure
of
the
last
forty
years
was
abandoned
and
maclean
was
tried
for
high
treason
the
result
was
what
might
have
been
expected
the
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
but
insane
and
the
prisoner
was
sent
to
an
asylum
during
her
majesty
pleasure
their
verdict
however
produced
a
remarkable
consequence
victoria
who
doubtless
carried
in
her
mind
some
memory
of
albert
disapproval
of
a
similar
verdict
in
the
case
of
oxford
was
very
much
annoyed
what
did
the
jury
mean
she
asked
by
saying
that
maclean
was
not
guilty
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
he
was
guilty
she
had
seen
him
fire
off
the
pistol
herself
it
was
in
vain
that
her
majesty
constitutional
advisers
reminded
her
of
the
principle
of
english
law
which
lays
down
that
no
man
can
be
found
guilty
of
a
crime
unless
he
be
proved
to
have
had
a
criminal
intention
victoria
was
quite
unconvinced
if
that
is
the
law
she
said
the
law
must
be
altered
and
altered
it
was
in
an
act
was
passed
changing
the
form
of
the
verdict
in
cases
of
insanity
and
the
confusing
anomaly
remains
upon
the
statute
book
to
this
day
but
it
was
not
only
through
the
feelings
commiserating
or
indignant
of
personal
sympathy
that
the
queen
and
her
people
were
being
drawn
more
nearly
together
they
were
beginning
at
last
to
come
to
a
close
and
permanent
agreement
upon
the
conduct
of
public
affairs
second
administration
was
a
succession
of
failures
ending
in
disaster
and
disgrace
liberalism
fell
into
discredit
with
the
country
and
victoria
perceived
with
joy
that
her
distrust
of
her
ministers
was
shared
by
an
number
of
her
subjects
during
the
crisis
in
the
sudan
the
popular
temper
was
her
own
she
had
been
among
the
first
to
urge
the
necessity
of
an
expedition
to
khartoum
and
when
the
news
came
of
the
catastrophic
death
of
general
gordon
her
voice
led
the
chorus
of
denunciation
which
raved
against
the
government
in
her
rage
she
despatched
a
fulminating
telegram
to
gladstone
not
in
the
usual
cypher
but
open
and
her
letter
of
condolence
to
miss
gordon
in
which
she
attacked
her
ministers
for
breach
of
faith
was
widely
published
it
was
rumoured
that
she
had
sent
for
lord
hartington
the
secretary
of
state
for
war
and
vehemently
upbraided
him
she
rated
me
he
was
reported
to
have
told
a
friend
as
if
i
been
a
footman
why
she
send
for
the
butler
asked
his
friend
oh
was
the
reply
the
butler
generally
manages
to
keep
out
of
the
way
on
such
occasions
but
the
day
came
when
it
was
impossible
to
keep
out
of
the
way
any
longer
gladstone
was
defeated
and
resigned
victoria
at
a
final
interview
received
him
with
her
usual
amenity
but
besides
the
formalities
demanded
by
the
occasion
the
only
remark
which
she
made
to
him
of
a
personal
nature
was
to
the
effect
that
she
supposed
gladstone
would
now
require
some
rest
he
remembered
with
regret
how
at
a
similar
audience
in
she
had
expressed
her
trust
in
him
as
a
supporter
of
the
throne
but
he
noted
the
change
without
surprise
her
mind
and
opinions
he
wrote
in
his
diary
afterwards
have
since
that
day
been
seriously
warped
such
was
gladstone
view
but
the
majority
of
the
nation
by
no
means
agreed
with
him
and
in
the
general
election
of
they
showed
decisively
that
victoria
politics
were
identical
with
theirs
by
casting
forth
the
contrivers
of
home
rule
that
abomination
of
desolation
into
outer
darkness
and
placing
lord
salisbury
in
power
victoria
satisfaction
was
profound
a
flood
of
new
unwonted
hopefulness
swept
over
her
stimulating
her
vital
spirits
with
a
surprising
force
her
habit
of
life
was
suddenly
altered
abandoning
the
long
seclusion
which
disraeli
persuasions
had
only
momentarily
interrupted
she
threw
herself
vigorously
into
a
multitude
of
public
activities
she
appeared
at
at
concerts
at
reviews
she
laid
she
went
to
liverpool
to
open
an
international
exhibition
driving
through
the
streets
in
her
open
carriage
in
heavy
rain
amid
vast
applauding
crowds
delighted
by
the
welcome
which
met
her
everywhere
she
warmed
to
her
work
she
visited
edinburgh
where
the
ovation
of
liverpool
was
repeated
and
surpassed
in
london
she
opened
in
high
state
the
colonial
and
indian
exhibition
at
south
kensington
on
this
occasion
the
ceremonial
was
particularly
magnificent
a
blare
of
trumpets
announced
the
approach
of
her
majesty
the
natiohal
anthem
followed
and
the
queen
seated
on
a
gorgeous
throne
of
hammered
gold
replied
with
her
own
lips
to
the
address
that
was
presented
to
her
then
she
rose
and
advancing
upon
the
platform
with
regal
port
acknowledged
the
acclamations
of
the
great
assembly
by
a
succession
of
curtseys
of
elaborate
and
commanding
grace
next
year
was
the
fiftieth
of
her
reign
and
in
june
the
splendid
anniversary
was
celebrated
in
solemn
pomp
victoria
surrounded
by
the
highest
dignitaries
of
her
realm
escorted
by
a
glittering
galaxy
of
kings
and
princes
drove
through
the
crowded
enthusiasm
of
the
capital
to
render
thanks
to
god
in
westminster
abbey
in
that
triumphant
hour
the
last
remaining
traces
of
past
antipathies
and
past
disagreements
were
altogether
swept
away
the
queen
was
hailed
at
once
as
the
mother
of
her
people
and
as
the
embodied
symbol
of
their
imperial
greatness
and
she
responded
to
the
double
sentiment
with
all
the
ardour
of
her
spirit
england
and
the
people
of
england
she
knew
it
she
felt
it
were
in
some
wonderful
and
yet
quite
simple
manner
hers
exultation
affection
gratitude
a
profound
sense
of
obligation
an
unbounded
pride
such
were
her
emotions
and
colouring
and
intensifying
the
rest
there
was
something
else
at
last
after
so
long
happiness
fragmentary
perhaps
and
charged
with
gravity
but
true
and
unmistakable
none
the
less
had
returned
to
her
the
unaccustomed
feeling
filled
and
warmed
her
consciousness
when
at
buckingham
palace
again
the
long
ceremony
over
she
was
asked
how
she
was
i
am
very
tired
but
very
happy
she
said
iii
and
so
after
the
toils
and
tempests
of
the
day
a
long
evening
followed
mild
serene
and
lighted
with
a
golden
glory
for
an
unexampled
atmosphere
of
success
and
adoration
invested
the
last
period
of
victoria
life
her
triumph
was
the
summary
the
crown
of
a
greater
triumph
the
culminating
prosperity
of
a
nation
the
solid
splendour
of
the
decade
between
victoria
two
jubilees
can
hardly
be
paralleled
in
the
annals
of
england
the
sage
counsels
of
lord
salisbury
seemed
to
bring
with
them
not
only
wealth
and
power
but
security
and
the
country
settled
down
with
calm
assurance
to
the
enjoyment
of
an
established
grandeur
and
it
was
only
natural
victoria
settled
down
too
for
she
was
a
part
of
the
establishment
an
essential
part
as
it
seemed
a
fixture
a
magnificent
immovable
sideboard
in
the
huge
saloon
of
state
without
her
the
banquet
of
would
have
lost
its
distinctive
quality
the
comfortable
order
of
the
substantial
unambiguous
dishes
with
their
background
of
weighty
glamour
half
out
of
sight
her
own
existence
came
to
harmonise
more
and
more
with
what
was
around
her
gradually
imperceptibly
albert
receded
it
was
not
that
he
was
forgotten
that
would
have
been
impossible
but
that
the
void
created
by
his
absence
grew
less
agonising
and
even
at
last
less
obvious
at
last
victoria
found
it
possible
to
regret
the
bad
weather
without
immediately
reflecting
that
her
dear
albert
always
said
we
could
not
alter
it
but
must
leave
it
as
it
was
she
could
even
enjoy
a
good
breakfast
without
considering
how
dear
albert
would
have
liked
the
buttered
eggs
and
as
that
figure
slowly
faded
its
place
was
taken
inevitably
by
victoria
own
her
being
revolving
for
so
many
years
round
an
external
object
now
changed
its
motion
and
found
its
centre
in
itself
it
had
to
be
so
her
domestic
position
the
pressure
of
her
public
work
her
indomitable
sense
of
duty
made
anything
else
impossible
her
egotism
proclaimed
its
rights
her
age
increased
still
further
the
surrounding
deference
and
her
force
of
character
emerging
at
length
in
all
its
plenitude
imposed
absolutely
upon
its
environment
by
the
conscious
effort
of
an
imperious
will
little
by
little
it
was
noticed
that
the
outward
vestiges
of
posthumous
domination
grew
less
complete
at
court
the
stringency
of
mourning
was
relaxed
as
the
queen
drove
through
the
park
in
her
open
carriage
with
her
highlanders
behind
her
canvassed
eagerly
the
growing
patch
of
violet
velvet
in
the
bonnet
with
its
jet
appurtenances
on
the
small
bowing
head
it
was
in
her
family
that
victoria
ascendancy
reached
its
highest
point
all
her
offspring
were
married
the
number
of
her
descendants
rapidly
increased
there
were
many
marriages
in
the
third
generation
and
no
fewer
than
of
her
were
living
at
the
time
of
her
death
a
picture
of
the
period
displays
the
royal
family
collected
together
in
one
of
the
great
rooms
at
windsor
a
crowded
company
of
more
than
fifty
persons
with
the
imperial
matriarch
in
their
midst
over
them
all
she
ruled
with
a
most
potent
sway
the
small
concerns
of
the
youngest
aroused
her
passionate
interest
and
the
oldest
she
treated
as
if
they
were
children
still
the
prince
of
wales
in
particular
stood
in
tremendous
awe
of
his
mother
she
had
steadily
refused
to
allow
him
the
slightest
participation
in
the
business
of
government
and
he
had
occupied
himself
in
other
ways
nor
could
it
be
denied
that
he
enjoyed
himself
out
of
her
sight
but
in
that
redoubtable
presence
his
abounding
manhood
suffered
a
miserable
eclipse
once
at
osborne
when
owing
to
no
fault
of
his
he
was
too
late
for
a
dinner
party
he
was
observed
standing
behind
a
pillar
and
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
trying
to
nerve
himself
to
go
up
to
the
queen
when
at
last
he
did
so
she
gave
him
a
stiff
nod
whereupon
he
vanished
immediately
behind
another
pillar
and
remained
there
until
the
party
broke
up
at
the
time
of
this
incident
the
prince
of
wales
was
over
fifty
years
of
age
it
was
inevitable
that
the
queen
domestic
activities
should
occasionally
trench
upon
the
domain
of
high
diplomacy
and
this
was
especially
the
case
when
the
interests
of
her
eldest
daughter
the
crown
princess
of
prussia
were
at
stake
the
crown
prince
held
liberal
opinions
he
was
much
influenced
by
his
wife
and
both
were
detested
by
bismarck
who
declared
with
scurrilous
emphasis
that
the
englishwoman
and
her
mother
were
a
menace
to
the
prussian
state
the
feud
was
still
further
intensified
when
on
the
death
of
the
old
emperor
the
crown
prince
succeeded
to
the
throne
a
family
entanglement
brought
on
a
violent
crisis
one
of
the
daughters
of
the
new
empress
had
become
betrothed
to
prince
alexander
of
battenberg
who
had
lately
been
ejected
from
the
throne
of
bulgaria
owing
to
the
hostility
of
the
tsar
victoria
as
well
as
the
empress
highly
approved
of
the
match
of
the
two
brothers
of
prince
alexander
the
elder
had
married
another
of
her
and
the
younger
was
the
husband
of
her
daughter
the
princess
beatrice
she
was
devoted
to
the
handsome
young
man
and
she
was
delighted
by
the
prospect
of
the
third
brother
on
the
whole
the
handsomest
she
thought
of
the
three
also
becoming
a
member
of
her
family
unfortunately
however
bismarck
was
opposed
to
the
scheme
he
perceived
that
the
marriage
would
endanger
the
friendship
between
germany
and
russia
which
was
vital
to
his
foreign
policy
and
he
announced
that
it
must
not
take
place
a
fierce
struggle
between
the
empress
and
the
chancellor
followed
victoria
whose
hatred
of
her
daughter
enemy
was
unbounded
came
over
to
charlottenburg
to
join
in
the
fray
bismarck
over
his
pipe
and
lager
snorted
out
his
alarm
the
queen
of
england
object
he
said
was
clearly
political
she
wished
to
estrange
germany
and
russia
and
very
likely
she
would
have
her
way
in
family
matters
he
added
she
is
not
used
to
contradiction
she
would
bring
the
parson
with
her
in
her
travelling
bag
and
the
bridegroom
in
her
trunk
and
the
marriage
would
come
off
on
the
spot
but
the
man
of
blood
and
iron
was
not
to
be
thwarted
so
easily
and
he
asked
for
a
private
interview
with
the
queen
the
details
of
their
conversation
are
unknown
but
it
is
certain
that
in
the
course
of
it
victoria
was
forced
to
realise
the
meaning
of
resistance
to
that
formidable
personage
and
that
she
promised
to
use
all
her
influence
to
prevent
the
marriage
the
engagement
was
broken
off
and
in
the
following
year
prince
alexander
of
battenberg
united
himself
to
fraulein
loisinger
an
actress
at
the
court
theatre
of
darmstad
but
such
painful
incidents
were
rare
victoria
was
growing
very
old
with
no
albert
to
guide
her
with
no
beaconsfield
to
enflame
her
she
was
willing
enough
to
abandon
the
dangerous
questions
of
diplomacy
to
the
wisdom
of
lord
salisbury
and
to
concentrate
her
energies
upon
objects
which
touched
her
more
nearly
and
over
which
she
could
exercise
an
undisputed
control
her
home
her
court
the
monuments
at
balmoral
the
livestock
at
windsor
the
organisation
of
her
engagements
the
supervision
of
the
multitudinous
details
of
her
daily
routine
such
matters
played
now
an
even
greater
part
in
her
existence
than
before
her
life
passed
in
an
extraordinary
exactitude
every
moment
of
her
day
was
mapped
out
beforehand
the
succession
of
her
engagements
was
immutably
fixed
the
dates
of
her
journeys
to
osborne
to
balmoral
to
the
south
of
france
to
windsor
to
london
were
hardly
altered
from
year
to
year
she
demanded
from
those
who
surrounded
her
a
rigid
precision
in
details
and
she
was
preternaturally
quick
in
detecting
the
slightest
deviation
from
the
rules
which
she
had
laid
down
such
was
the
irresistible
potency
of
her
personality
that
anything
but
the
most
implicit
obedience
to
her
wishes
was
felt
to
be
impossible
but
sometimes
somebody
was
unpunctual
and
unpunctuality
was
one
of
the
most
heinous
of
sins
then
her
displeasure
her
dreadful
displeasure
became
all
too
visible
at
such
moments
there
seemed
nothing
surprising
in
her
having
been
the
daughter
of
a
martinet
but
these
storms
unnerving
as
they
were
while
they
lasted
were
quickly
over
and
they
grew
more
and
more
exceptional
with
the
return
of
happiness
a
gentle
benignity
flowed
from
the
aged
queen
her
smile
once
so
rare
a
visitant
to
those
saddened
features
flitted
over
them
with
an
easy
alacrity
the
blue
eyes
beamed
the
whole
face
starting
suddenly
from
its
pendulous
expressionlessness
brightened
and
softened
and
cast
over
those
who
watched
it
an
unforgettable
charm
for
in
her
last
years
there
was
a
fascination
in
victoria
amiability
which
had
been
lacking
even
from
the
vivid
impulse
of
her
youth
over
all
who
approached
her
or
very
nearly
all
she
threw
a
peculiar
spell
her
grandchildren
adored
her
her
ladies
waited
upon
her
with
a
reverential
love
the
honour
of
serving
her
obliterated
a
thousand
inconveniences
the
monotony
of
a
court
existence
the
fatigue
of
standing
the
necessity
for
a
superhuman
attentiveness
to
the
minutia
of
time
and
space
as
one
did
one
wonderful
duty
one
could
forget
that
one
legs
were
aching
from
the
infinitude
of
the
passages
at
windsor
or
that
one
bare
arms
were
turning
blue
in
the
balmoral
cold
what
above
all
seemed
to
make
such
service
delightful
was
the
detailed
interest
which
the
queen
took
in
the
circumstances
of
those
around
her
her
absorbing
passion
for
the
comfortable
commonplaces
the
small
crises
the
recurrent
sentimentalities
of
domestic
life
constantly
demanded
wider
fields
for
its
activity
the
sphere
of
her
own
family
vast
as
it
was
was
not
enough
she
became
the
eager
confidante
of
the
household
affairs
of
her
ladies
her
sympathies
reached
out
to
the
palace
domestics
even
the
housemaids
and
scullions
so
it
appeared
were
the
objects
of
her
searching
inquiries
and
of
her
heartfelt
solicitude
when
their
lovers
were
ordered
to
a
foreign
station
or
their
aunts
suffered
from
an
attack
of
rheumatism
which
was
more
than
usually
acute
nevertheless
the
due
distinctions
of
rank
were
immaculately
preserved
the
queen
mere
presence
was
enough
to
ensure
that
but
in
addition
the
dominion
of
court
etiquette
was
paramount
for
that
elaborate
code
which
had
kept
lord
melbourne
stiff
upon
the
sofa
and
ranged
the
other
guests
in
silence
about
the
round
table
according
to
the
order
of
precedence
was
as
punctiliously
enforced
as
ever
every
evening
after
dinner
the
sacred
to
royalty
loomed
before
the
profane
in
inaccessible
glory
or
on
one
or
two
terrific
occasions
actually
lured
them
magnetically
forward
to
the
very
edge
of
the
abyss
the
queen
at
the
fitting
moment
moved
towards
her
guests
one
after
the
other
they
were
led
up
to
her
and
while
dialogue
followed
dialogue
in
constraint
and
embarrassment
the
rest
of
the
assembly
stood
still
without
a
word
only
in
one
particular
was
the
severity
of
the
etiquette
allowed
to
lapse
throughout
the
greater
part
of
the
reign
the
rule
that
ministers
must
stand
during
their
audiences
with
the
queen
had
been
absolute
when
lord
derby
the
prime
minister
had
an
audience
of
her
majesty
after
a
serious
illness
he
mentioned
it
afterwards
as
a
proof
of
the
royal
favour
that
the
queen
had
remarked
how
sorry
she
was
she
could
not
ask
him
to
be
seated
subsequently
disraeli
after
an
attack
of
gout
and
in
a
moment
of
extreme
expansion
on
the
part
of
victoria
had
been
offered
a
chair
but
he
had
thought
it
wise
humbly
to
decline
the
privilege
in
her
later
years
however
the
queen
invariably
asked
gladstone
and
lord
salisbury
to
sit
down
sometimes
the
solemnity
of
the
evening
was
diversified
by
a
concert
an
opera
or
even
a
play
one
of
the
most
marked
indications
of
victoria
enfranchisement
from
the
thraldom
of
widowhood
had
been
her
resumption
after
an
interval
of
thirty
years
of
the
custom
of
commanding
dramatic
companies
from
london
to
perform
before
the
court
at
windsor
on
such
occasions
her
spirits
rose
high
she
loved
acting
she
loved
a
good
plot
above
all
she
loved
a
farce
engrossed
by
everything
that
passed
upon
the
stage
she
would
follow
with
childlike
innocence
the
unwinding
of
the
story
or
she
would
assume
an
air
of
knowing
superiority
and
exclaim
in
triumph
there
you
did
expect
that
did
you
when
the
denouement
came
her
sense
of
humour
was
of
a
vigorous
though
primitive
kind
she
had
been
one
of
the
very
few
persons
who
had
always
been
able
to
appreciate
the
prince
consort
jokes
and
when
those
were
cracked
no
more
she
could
still
roar
with
laughter
in
the
privacy
of
her
household
over
some
small
piece
of
fun
some
oddity
of
an
ambassador
or
some
ignorant
minister
faux
pas
when
the
jest
grew
subtle
she
was
less
pleased
but
if
it
approached
the
confines
of
the
indecorous
the
danger
was
serious
to
take
a
liberty
called
down
at
once
her
majesty
most
crushing
disapprobation
and
to
say
something
improper
was
to
take
the
greatest
liberty
of
all
then
the
royal
lips
sank
down
at
the
corners
the
royal
eyes
stared
in
astonished
protrusion
and
in
fact
the
royal
countenance
became
inauspicious
in
the
highest
degree
the
transgressor
shuddered
into
silence
while
the
awful
we
are
not
amused
annihilated
the
dinner
table
afterwards
in
her
private
entourage
the
queen
would
observe
that
the
person
in
question
was
she
very
much
feared
not
discreet
it
was
a
verdict
from
which
there
was
no
appeal
in
general
her
aesthetic
tastes
had
remained
unchanged
since
the
days
of
mendelssohn
landseer
and
lablache
she
still
delighted
in
the
roulades
of
italian
opera
she
still
demanded
a
high
standard
in
the
execution
of
a
pianoforte
duet
her
views
on
painting
were
decided
sir
edwin
she
declared
was
perfect
she
was
much
impressed
by
lord
leighton
manners
and
she
profoundly
distrusted
watts
from
time
to
time
she
ordered
engraved
portraits
to
be
taken
of
members
of
the
royal
family
on
these
occasions
she
would
have
the
first
proofs
submitted
to
her
and
having
inspected
them
with
minute
particularity
she
would
point
out
their
mistakes
to
the
artists
indicating
at
the
same
time
how
they
might
be
corrected
the
artists
invariably
discovered
that
her
majesty
suggestions
were
of
the
highest
value
in
literature
her
interests
were
more
restricted
she
was
devoted
to
lord
tennyson
and
as
the
prince
consort
had
admired
george
eliot
she
perused
middlemarch
she
was
disappointed
there
is
reason
to
believe
however
that
the
romances
of
another
female
writer
whose
popularity
among
the
humbler
classes
of
her
majesty
subjects
was
at
one
time
enormous
secured
no
less
the
approval
of
her
majesty
otherwise
she
did
not
read
very
much
once
however
the
queen
attention
was
drawn
to
a
publication
which
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
ignore
the
greville
memoirs
filled
with
a
mass
of
historical
information
of
extraordinary
importance
but
filled
also
with
descriptions
which
were
by
no
means
flattering
of
george
iv
william
iv
and
other
royal
persons
was
brought
out
by
reeve
victoria
read
the
book
and
was
appalled
it
was
she
declared
a
dreadful
and
really
scandalous
book
and
she
could
not
say
how
horrified
and
indignant
she
was
at
greville
indiscretion
indelicacy
ingratitude
towards
friends
betrayal
of
confidence
and
shameful
disloyalty
towards
his
sovereign
she
wrote
to
disraeli
to
tell
him
that
in
her
opinion
it
was
very
important
that
the
book
should
be
severely
censured
and
discredited
the
tone
in
which
he
speaks
of
royalty
she
added
is
unlike
anything
one
sees
in
history
even
and
is
most
reprehensible
her
anger
was
directed
with
almost
equal
vehemence
against
reeve
for
his
having
published
such
an
abominable
book
and
she
charged
sir
arthur
helps
to
convey
to
him
her
deep
displeasure
reeve
however
was
impenitent
when
sir
arthur
told
him
that
in
the
queen
opinion
the
book
degraded
royalty
he
replied
not
at
all
it
elevates
it
by
the
contrast
it
offers
between
the
present
and
the
defunct
state
of
affairs
but
this
adroit
defence
failed
to
make
any
impression
upon
victoria
and
reeve
when
he
retired
from
the
public
service
did
not
receive
the
knighthood
which
custom
entitled
him
to
expect
perhaps
if
the
queen
had
known
how
many
caustic
comments
upon
herself
reeve
had
quietly
suppressed
in
the
published
memoirs
she
would
have
been
almost
grateful
to
him
but
in
that
case
what
would
she
have
said
of
greville
imagination
boggles
at
the
thought
as
for
more
modern
essays
upon
the
same
topic
her
majesty
it
is
to
be
feared
would
have
characterised
them
as
not
discreet
but
as
a
rule
the
leisure
hours
of
that
active
life
were
occupied
with
recreations
of
a
less
intangible
quality
than
the
study
of
literature
or
the
appreciation
of
art
victoria
was
a
woman
not
only
of
vast
property
but
of
innumerable
possessions
she
had
inherited
an
immense
quantity
of
furniture
of
ornaments
of
china
of
plate
of
valuable
objects
of
every
kind
her
purchases
throughout
a
long
life
made
a
formidable
addition
to
these
stores
and
there
flowed
in
upon
her
besides
from
every
quarter
of
the
globe
a
constant
stream
of
gifts
over
this
enormous
mass
she
exercised
an
unceasing
and
minute
supervision
and
the
arrangement
and
the
contemplation
of
it
in
all
its
details
filled
her
with
an
intimate
satisfaction
the
collecting
instinct
has
its
roots
in
the
very
depths
of
human
nature
and
in
the
case
of
victoria
it
seemed
to
owe
its
force
to
two
of
her
dominating
impulses
the
intense
sense
which
had
always
been
hers
of
her
own
personality
and
the
craving
which
growing
with
the
years
had
become
in
her
old
age
almost
an
obsession
for
fixity
for
solidity
for
the
setting
up
of
palpable
barriers
against
the
outrages
of
change
and
time
when
she
considered
the
multitudinous
objects
which
belonged
to
her
or
better
still
when
choosing
out
some
section
of
them
as
the
fancy
took
her
she
actually
savoured
the
vivid
richness
of
their
individual
qualities
she
saw
herself
deliciously
reflected
from
a
million
facets
felt
herself
magnified
miraculously
over
a
boundless
area
and
was
well
pleased
that
was
just
as
it
should
be
but
then
came
the
dismaying
thought
everything
slips
away
crumbles
vanishes
sevres
get
broken
even
golden
basins
go
unaccountably
astray
even
one
self
with
all
the
recollections
and
experiences
that
make
up
one
being
fluctuates
perishes
dissolves
but
no
it
could
not
should
not
be
so
there
should
be
no
changes
and
no
losses
nothing
should
ever
move
neither
the
past
nor
the
present
and
she
herself
least
of
all
and
so
the
tenacious
woman
hoarding
her
valuables
decreed
their
immortality
with
all
the
resolution
of
her
soul
she
would
not
lose
one
memory
or
one
pin
she
gave
orders
that
nothing
should
be
thrown
away
and
nothing
was
there
in
drawer
after
drawer
in
wardrobe
after
wardrobe
reposed
the
dresses
of
seventy
years
but
not
only
the
dresses
the
furs
and
the
mantles
and
subsidiary
frills
and
the
muffs
and
the
parasols
and
the
bonnets
all
were
ranged
in
chronological
order
dated
and
complete
a
great
cupboard
was
devoted
to
the
dolls
in
the
china
room
at
windsor
a
special
table
held
the
mugs
of
her
childhood
and
her
children
mugs
as
well
mementoes
of
the
past
surrounded
her
in
serried
accumulations
in
every
room
the
tables
were
powdered

with
the
photographs
of
relatives

portraits

all
ages

in

the

boy
and
boz
lay
together
among
unfading
flowers
in
bronze
and
it
was
not
enough
that
each
particle
of
the
past
should
be
given
the
stability
of
metal
or
of
marble
the
whole
collection
in
its
arrangement
no
less
than
its
entity
should
be
immutably
fixed
there
might
be
additions
but
there
might
never
be
alterations
no
chintz
might
change
no
carpet
no
curtain
be
replaced
by
another
or
if
long
use
at
last
made
it
necessary
the

and
the
patterns
must
be
so
identically
reproduced
that
the
keenest
eye
might
not
detect
the
difference
no
new
picture
could
be
hung
upon
the
walls
at

for
those
already
there
had
been
put
in
their
places
by
albert
whose
decisions
were
eternal
so
indeed
were

ensure
that
they

the
aid
of
the
camera
was
called
in
every
single
article
in
the
queen
possession
was
photographed
from
several
points
of
view
these
photographs
were
submitted
to
her
majesty
and
when
after
careful
inspection
she
had
approved
of
them
they
were
placed
in
a
series
of
albums
richly
bound
then
opposite
each
photograph
an
entry
was
made
indicating
the
number
of
the
article
the
number
of
the
room
in
which
it
was
kept
its
exact
position
in
the
room
and
all
its
principal
characteristics
the
fate
of
every
object
which
had
undergone
this
process
was
henceforth
irrevocably
sealed
the
whole
multitude
once
and
for
all
took
up
its
steadfast
station
and
victoria
with
a
gigantic
volume
or
two
of
the
endless
catalogue
always
beside
her
to
look
through
to
ponder
upon
to
expatiate
over
could
feel
with
a
double
contentment
that
the
transitoriness
of
this
world
had
been
arrested
by
the
amplitude
of
her
might
thus
the
collection
ever
multiplying
ever
encroaching
upon
new
fields
of
consciousness
ever
rooting
itself
more
firmly
in
the
depths
of
instinct
became
one
of
the
dominating
influences
of
that
strange
existence
it
was
a
collection
not
merely
of
things
and
of
thoughts
but
of
states
of
mind
and
ways
of
living
as
well
the
celebration
of
anniversaries
grew
to
be
an
important
branch
of
it
of
birthdays
and
marriage
days
and
death
days
each
of
which
demanded
its
appropriate
feeling
which
in
its
turn
must
be
itself
expressed
in
an
appropriate
outward
form
and
the
form
of
course
the
ceremony
of
rejoicing
or
lamentation
was
stereotyped
with
the
rest
it
was
part
of
the
collection
on
a
certain
day
for
instance
flowers
must
be
strewn
on
john
brown
monument
at
balmoral
and
the
date
of
the
yearly
departure
for
scotland
was
fixed
by
that
fact
inevitably
it
was
around
the
central
circumstance
of
death
death
the
final
witness
to
human
mutability
that
these
commemorative
cravings
clustered
most
thickly
might
not
even
death
itself
be
humbled
if
one
could
recall
enough
if
one
asserted
with
a
sufficiently
passionate
and
reiterated
emphasis
the
eternity
of
love
accordingly
every
bed
in
which
victoria
slept
had
attached
to
it
at
the
back
on
the
side
above
the
pillow
a
photograph
of
the
head
and
shoulders
of
albert
as
he
lay
dead
surmounted
by
a
wreath
of
immortelles
at
balmoral
where
memories
came
crowding
so
closely
the
solid
signs
of
memory
appeared
in
surprising
profusion
obelisks
pyramids
tombs
statues
cairns
and
seats
of
inscribed
granite
proclaimed
victoria
dedication
to
the
dead
there
twice
a
year
on
the
days
that
followed
her
arrival
a
solemn
pilgrimage
of
inspection
and
meditation
was
performed
there
on
august
albert
birthday
at
the
foot
of
the
bronze
statue
of
him
in
highland
dress
the
queen
her
family
her
court
her
servants
and
her
tenantry
met
together
and
in
silence
drank
to
the
memory
of
the
dead
in
england
the
tokens
of
remembrance
pullulated
hardly
less
not
a
day
passed
without
some
addition
to
the
multifold
assemblage
a
gold
statuette
of
ross
the
piper
a
marble
group
of
victoria
and
albert
in
medieval
costume
inscribed
upon
the
base
with
the
words
allured
to
brighter
worlds
and
led
the
a
granite
slab
in
the
shrubbery
at
osborne
informing
the
visitor
of
waldmann
the
very
favourite
little
dachshund
of
queen
victoria
who
brought
him
from
baden
april
died
july
at
frogmore
the
great
mausoleum
perpetually
enriched
was
visited
almost
daily
by
the
queen
when
the
court
was
at
windsor
but
there
was
another
a
more
secret
and
a
hardly
less
holy
shrine
the
suite
of
rooms
which
albert
had
occupied
in
the
castle
was
kept
for
ever
shut
away
from
the
eyes
of
any
save
the
most
privileged
within
those
precincts
everything
remained
as
it
had
been
at
the
prince
death
but
the
mysterious
preoccupation
of
victoria
had
commanded
that
her
clothing
should
be
laid
afresh
each
evening
upon
the
bed
and
that
each
evening
the
water
should
be
set
ready
in
the
basin
as
if
he
were
still
alive
and
this
incredible
rite
was
performed
with
scrupulous
regularity
for
nearly
forty
years
such
was
the
inner
worship
and
still
the
flesh
obeyed
the
spirit
still
the
daily
hours
of
labour
proclaimed
victoria
consecration
to
duty
and
to
the
ideal
of
the
dead
yet
with
the
years
the
sense
of
faded
the
natural
energies
of
that
ardent
being
discharged
themselves
with
satisfaction
into
the
channel
of
public
work
the
love
of
business
which
from
her
girlhood
had
been
strong
within
her
reasserted
itself
in
all
its
vigour
and
in
her
old
age
to
have
been
cut
off
from
her
papers
and
her
boxes
would
have
been
not
a
relief
but
an
agony
to
victoria
thus
though
toiling
ministers
might
sigh
and
suffer
the
whole
process
of
government
continued
till
the
very
end
to
pass
before
her
nor
was
that
all
ancient
precedent
had
made
the
validity
of
an
enormous
number
of
official
transactions
dependent
upon
the
application
of
the
royal
and
a
great
proportion
of
the
queen
working
hours
was
spent
in
this
mechanical
task
nor
did
she
show
any
desire
to
diminish
it
on
the
contrary
she
voluntarily
resumed
the
duty
of
signing
commissions
in
the
army
from
which
she
had
been
set
free
by
act
of
parliament
and
from
which
during
the
years
of
middle
life
she
had
abstained
in
no
case
would
she
countenance
the
proposal
that
she
should
use
a
stamp
but
at
last
when
the
increasing
pressure
of
business
made
the
delays
of
the
antiquated
system
intolerable
she
consented
that
for
certain
classes
of
documents
her
oral
sanction
should
be
sufficient
each
paper
was
read
aloud
to
her
and
she
said
at
the
end
approved
often
for
hours
at
a
time
she
would
sit
with
albert
bust
in
front
of
her
while
the
word
approved
issued
at
intervals
from
her
lips
the
word
came
forth
with
a
majestic
sonority
for
her
voice
now
how
changed
from
the
silvery
treble
of
her
girlhood
was
a
contralto
full
and
strong
iv
the
final
years
were
years
of
apotheosis
in
the
dazzled
imagination
of
her
subjects
victoria
soared
aloft
towards
the
regions
of
divinity
through
a
nimbus
of
purest
glory
criticism
fell
dumb
deficiencies
which
twenty
years
earlier
would
have
been
universally
admitted
were
now
as
universally
ignored
that
the
nation
idol
was
a
very
incomplete
representative
of
the
nation
was
a
circumstance
that
was
hardly
noticed
and
yet
it
was
conspicuously
true
for
the
vast
changes
which
out
of
the
england
of
had
produced
the
england
of
seemed
scarcely
to
have
touched
the
queen
the
immense
industrial
development
of
the
period
the
significance
of
which
had
been
so
thoroughly
understood
by
albert
meant
little
indeed
to
victoria
the
amazing
scientific
movement
which
albert
had
appreciated
no
less
left
victoria
perfectly
cold
her
conception
of
the
universe
and
of
man
place
in
it
and
of
the
stupendous
problems
of
nature
and
philosophy
remained
throughout
her
life
entirely
unchanged
her
religion
was
the
religion
which
she
had
learnt
from
the
baroness
lehzen
and
the
duchess
of
kent
here
too
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
albert
views
might
have
influenced
her
for
albert
in
matters
of
religion
was
advanced
disbelieving
altogether
in
evil
spirits
he
had
had
his
doubts
about
the
miracle
of
the
gaderene
swine
stockmar
even
had
thrown
out
in
a
remarkable
memorandum
on
the
education
of
the
prince
of
wales
the
suggestion
that
while
the
child
must
unquestionably
be
brought
up
in
the
creed
of
the
church
of
england
it
might
nevertheless
be
in
accordance
with
the
spirit
of
the
times
to
exclude
from
his
religious
training
the
inculcation
of
a
belief
in
the
supernatural
doctrines
of
christianity
this
however
would
have
been
going
too
far
and
all
the
royal
children
were
brought
up
in
complete
orthodoxy
anything
else
would
have
grieved
victoria
though
her
own
conceptions
of
the
orthodox
were
not
very
precise
but
her
nature
in
which
imagination
and
subtlety
held
so
small
a
place
made
her
instinctively
recoil
from
the
intricate
ecstasies
of
high
anglicanism
and
she
seemed
to
feel
most
at
home
in
the
simple
faith
of
the
presbyterian
church
of
scotland
this
was
what
might
have
been
expected
for
lehzen
was
the
daughter
of
a
lutheran
pastor
and
the
lutherans
and
the
presbyterians
have
much
in
common
for
many
years
norman
macleod
an
innocent
scotch
minister
was
her
principal
spiritual
adviser
and
when
he
was
taken
from
her
she
drew
much
comfort
from
quiet
chats
about
life
and
death
with
the
cottagers
at
balmoral
her
piety
absolutely
genuine
found
what
it
wanted
in
the
sober
exhortations
of
old
john
grant
and
the
devout
saws
of
farquharson
they
possessed
the
qualities
which
as
a
child
of
fourteen
she
had
so
sincerely
admired
in
the
bishop
of
exposition
of
the
gospel
of
matthew
they
were
just
plain
and
comprehensible
and
full
of
truth
and
good
feeling
the
queen
who
gave
her
name
to
the
age
of
mill
and
of
darwin
never
got
any
further
than
that
from
the
social
movements
of
her
time
victoria
was
equally
remote
towards
the
smallest
no
less
than
towards
the
greatest
changes
she
remained
inflexible
during
her
youth
and
middle
age
smoking
had
been
forbidden
in
polite
society
and
so
long
as
she
lived
she
would
not
withdraw
her
anathema
against
it
kings
might
protest
bishops
and
ambassadors
invited
to
windsor
might
be
reduced
in
the
privacy
of
their
bedrooms
to
lie
upon
the
floor
and
smoke
up
the
chimney
the
interdict
continued
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
a
female
sovereign
would
have
lent
her
countenance
to
one
of
the
most
vital
of
all
the
reforms
to
which
her
epoch
gave
birth
the
emancipation
of
women
but
on
the
contrary
the
mere
mention
of
such
a
proposal
sent
the
blood
rushing
to
her
head
in
her
eye
having
fallen
upon
the
report
of
a
meeting
in
favour
of
women
suffrage
she
wrote
to
martin
in
royal
rage
the
queen
is
most
anxious
to
enlist
everyone
who
can
speak
or
write
to
join
in
checking
this
mad
wicked
folly
of
rights
with
all
its
attendant
horrors
on
which
her
poor
feeble
sex
is
bent
forgetting
every
sense
of
womanly
feeling
and
propriety
lady
ought
to
get
a
good
whipping
it
is
a
subject
which
makes
the
queen
so
furious
that
she
can
not
contain
herself
god
created
men
and
women
different
then
let
them
remain
each
in
their
own
position
tennyson
has
some
beautiful
lines
on
the
difference
of
men
and
women
in
princess
woman
would
become
the
most
hateful
heartless
and
disgusting
of
human
beings
were
she
allowed
to
unsex
herself
and
where
would
be
the
protection
which
man
was
intended
to
give
the
weaker
sex
the
queen
is
sure
that
martin
agrees
with
her
the
argument
was
irrefutable
martin
agreed
and
yet
the
canker
spread
in
another
direction
victoria
comprehension
of
the
spirit
of
her
age
has
been
constantly
asserted
it
was
for
long
the
custom
for
courtly
historians
and
polite
politicians
to
compliment
the
queen
upon
the
correctness
of
her
attitude
towards
the
constitution
but
such
praises
seem
hardly
to
be
justified
by
the
facts
in
her
later
years
victoria
more
than
once
alluded
with
regret
to
her
conduct
during
the
bedchamber
crisis
and
let
it
be
understood
that
she
had
grown
wiser
since
yet
in
truth
it
is
difficult
to
trace
any
fundamental
change
either
in
her
theory
or
her
practice
in
constitutional
matters
throughout
her
life
the
same
despotic
and
personal
spirit
which
led
her
to
break
off
the
negotiations
with
peel
is
equally
visible
in
her
animosity
towards
palmerston
in
her
threats
of
abdication
to
disraeli
and
in
her
desire
to
prosecute
the
duke
of
westminster
for
attending
a
meeting
upon
bulgarian
atrocities
the
complex
and
delicate
principles
of
the
constitution
can
not
be
said
to
have
come
within
the
compass
of
her
mental
faculties
and
in
the
actual
developments
which
it
underwent
during
her
reign
she
played
a
passive
part
from
to
the
power
of
the
crown
steadily
increased
in
england
from
to
it
steadily
declined
the
first
process
was
due
to
the
influence
of
the
prince
consort
the
second
to
that
of
a
series
of
great
ministers
during
the
first
victoria
was
in
effect
a
mere
accessory
during
the
second
the
threads
of
power
which
albert
had
so
laboriously
collected
inevitably
fell
from
her
hands
into
the
vigorous
grasp
of
gladstone
lord
beaconsfield
and
lord
salisbury
perhaps
absorbed
as
she
was
in
routine
and
difficult
as
she
found
it
to
distinguish
at
all
clearly
between
the
trivial
and
the
essential
she
was
only
dimly
aware
of
what
was
happening
yet
at
the
end
of
her
reign
the
crown
was
weaker
than
at
any
other
time
in
english
history
paradoxically
enough
victoria
received
the
highest
eulogiums
for
assenting
to
a
political
evolution
which
had
she
completely
realised
its
import
would
have
filled
her
with
supreme
displeasure
nevertheless
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
she
was
a
second
george
iii
her
desire
to
impose
her
will
vehement
as
it
was
and
unlimited
by
any
principle
was
yet
checked
by
a
certain
shrewdness
she
might
oppose
her
ministers
with
extraordinary
violence
she
might
remain
utterly
impervious
to
arguments
and
supplications
the
pertinacity
of
her
resolution
might
seem
to
be
unconquerable
but
at
the
very
last
moment
of
all
her
obstinacy
would
give
way
her
innate
respect
and
capacity
for
business
and
perhaps
too
the
memory
of
albert
scrupulous
avoidance
of
extreme
courses
prevented
her
from
ever
entering
an
impasse
by
instinct
she
understood
when
the
facts
were
too
much
for
her
and
to
them
she
invariably
yielded
after
all
what
else
could
she
do
but
if
in
all
these
ways
the
queen
and
her
epoch
were
profoundly
separated
the
points
of
contact
between
them
also
were
not
few
victoria
understood
very
well
the
meaning
and
the
attractions
of
power
and
property
and
in
such
learning
the
english
nation
too
had
grown
to
be
more
and
more
proficient
during
the
last
fifteen
years
of
the
reign
for
the
short
liberal
administration
of
was
a
mere
interlude
imperialism
was
the
dominant
creed
of
the
country
it
was
as
well
in
this
direction
if
in
no
other
she
had
allowed
her
mind
to
develop
under
disraeli
tutelage
the
british
dominions
over
the
seas
had
come
to
mean
much
more
to
her
than
ever
before
and
in
particular
she
had
grown
enamoured
of
the
east
the
thought
of
india
fascinated
her
she
set
to
and
learnt
a
little
hindustani
she
engaged
some
indian
servants
who
became
her
inseparable
attendants
and
one
of
whom
munshi
abdul
karim
eventually
almost
succeeded
to
the
position
which
had
once
been
john
brown
at
the
same
time
the
imperialist
temper
of
the
nation
invested
her
office
with
a
new
significance
exactly
harmonising
with
her
own
inmost
proclivities
the
english
polity
was
in
the
main
a
structure
but
there
was
always
a
corner
in
it
where
could
not
enter
where
somehow
or
other
the
ordinary
measurements
were
not
applicable
and
the
ordinary
rules
did
not
apply
so
our
ancestors
had
laid
it
down
giving
scope
in
their
wisdom
to
that
mystical
element
which
as
it
seems
can
never
quite
be
eradicated
from
the
affairs
of
men
naturally
it
was
in
the
crown
that
the
mysticism
of
the
english
polity
was
concentrated
the
crown
with
its
venerable
antiquity
its
sacred
associations
its
imposing
spectacular
array
but
for
nearly
two
centuries
had
been
predominant
in
the
great
building
and
the
little
unexplored
inexplicable
corner
had
attracted
small
attention
then
with
the
rise
of
imperialism
there
was
a
change
for
imperialism
is
a
faith
as
well
as
a
business
as
it
grew
the
mysticism
in
english
public
life
grew
with
it
and
simultaneously
a
new
importance
began
to
attach
to
the
crown
the
need
for
a
symbol
a
symbol
of
england
might
of
england
worth
of
england
extraordinary
and
mysterious
destiny
became
felt
more
urgently
than
ever
before
the
crown
was
that
symbol
and
the
crown
rested
upon
the
head
of
victoria
thus
it
happened
that
while
by
the
end
of
the
reign
the
power
of
the
sovereign
had
appreciably
diminished
the
prestige
of
the
sovereign
had
enormously
grown
yet
this
prestige
was
not
merely
the
outcome
of
public
changes
it
was
an
intensely
personal
matter
too
victoria
was
the
queen
of
england
the
empress
of
india
the
quintessential
pivot
round
which
the
whole
magnificent
machine
was
revolving
but
how
much
more
besides
for
one
thing
she
was
of
a
great
age
an
almost
indispensable
qualification
for
popularity
in
england
she
had
given
proof
of
one
of
the
most
admired
characteristics
of
the
race
persistent
vitality
she
had
reigned
for
sixty
years
and
she
was
not
out
and
then
she
was
a
character
the
outlines
of
her
nature
were
firmly
drawn
and
even
through
the
mists
which
envelop
royalty
clearly
visible
in
the
popular
imagination
her
familiar
figure
filled
with
satisfying
ease
a
distinct
and
memorable
place
it
was
besides
the
kind
of
figure
which
naturally
called
forth
the
admiring
sympathy
of
the
great
majority
of
the
nation
goodness
they
prized
above
every
other
human
quality
and
victoria
who
had
said
that
she
would
be
good
at
the
age
of
twelve
had
kept
her
word
duty
conscience
morality
yes
in
the
light
of
those
high
beacons
the
queen
had
always
lived
she
had
passed
her
days
in
work
and
not
in
pleasure
in
public
responsibilities
and
family
cares
the
standard
of
solid
virtue
which
had
been
set
up
so
long
ago
amid
the
domestic
happiness
of
osborne
had
never
been
lowered
for
an
instant
for
more
than
half
a
century
no
divorced
lady
had
approached
the
precincts
of
the
court
victoria
indeed
in
her
enthusiasm
for
wifely
fidelity
had
laid
down
a
still
stricter
ordinance
she
frowned
severely
upon
any
widow
who
married
again
considering
that
she
herself
was
the
offspring
of
a
widow
second
marriage
this
prohibition
might
be
regarded
as
an
eccentricity
but
no
doubt
it
was
an
eccentricity
on
the
right
side
the
middle
classes
firm
in
the
triple
brass
of
their
respectability
rejoiced
with
a
special
joy
over
the
most
respectable
of
queens
they
almost
claimed
her
indeed
as
one
of
themselves
but
this
would
have
been
an
exaggeration
for
though
many
of
her
characteristics
were
most
often
found
among
the
middle
classes
in
other
respects
in
her
manners
for
instance
victoria
was
decidedly
aristocratic
and
in
one
important
particular
she
was
neither
aristocratic
nor
her
attitude
toward
herself
was
simply
regal
such
qualities
were
obvious
and
important
but
in
the
impact
of
a
personality
it
is
something
deeper
something
fundamental
and
common
to
all
its
qualities
that
really
tells
in
victoria
it
is
easy
to
discern
the
nature
of
this
underlying
element
it
was
a
peculiar
sincerity
her
truthfulness
her
the
vividness
of
her
emotions
and
her
unrestrained
expression
of
them
were
the
varied
forms
which
this
central
characteristic
assumed
it
was
her
sincerity
which
gave
her
at
once
her
impressiveness
her
charm
and
her
absurdity
she
moved
through
life
with
the
imposing
certitude
of
one
to
whom
concealment
was
impossible
either
towards
her
surroundings
or
towards
herself
there
she
was
all
of
her
the
queen
of
england
complete
and
obvious
the
world
might
take
her
or
leave
her
she
had
nothing
more
to
show
or
to
explain
or
to
modify
and
with
her
peerless
carriage
she
swept
along
her
path
and
not
only
was
concealment
out
of
the
question
reticence
reserve
even
dignity
itself
as
it
sometimes
seemed
might
be
very
well
dispensed
with
as
lady
lyttelton
said
there
is
a
transparency
in
her
truth
that
is
very
striking
not
a
shade
of
exaggeration
in
describing
feelings
or
facts
like
very
few
other
people
i
ever
knew
many
may
be
as
true
but
i
think
it
goes
often
along
with
some
reserve
she
talks
all
out
just
as
it
is
no
more
and
no
less
she
talked
all
out
and
she
wrote
all
out
too
her
letters
in
the
surprising
jet
of
their
expression
remind
one
of
a
tap
what
is
within
pours
forth
in
an
immediate
spontaneous
rush
her
utterly
unliterary
style
has
at
least
the
merit
of
being
a
vehicle
exactly
suited
to
her
thoughts
and
feelings
and
even
the
platitude
of
her
phraseology
carries
with
it
a
curiously
personal
flavour
undoubtedly
it
was
through
her
writings
that
she
touched
the
heart
of
the
public
not
only
in
her
highland
journals
where
the
mild
chronicle
of
her
private
proceedings
was
laid
bare
without
a
trace
either
of
affectation
or
of
embarrassment
but
also
in
those
remarkable
messages
to
the
nation
which
from
time
to
time
she
published
in
the
newspapers
her
people
found
her
very
close
to
them
indeed
they
felt
instinctively
victoria
irresistible
sincerity
and
they
responded
and
in
truth
it
was
an
endearing
trait
the
personality
and
the
position
too
the
wonderful
combination
of
them
that
perhaps
was
what
was
finally
fascinating
in
the
case
the
little
old
lady
with
her
white
hair
and
her
plain
mourning
clothes
in
her
wheeled
chair
or
her
one
saw
her
so
and
then
close
behind
with
their
immediate
suggestion
of
singularity
of
mystery
and
of
power
the
indian
servants
that
was
the
familiar
vision
and
it
was
admirable
but
at
chosen
moments
it
was
right
that
the
widow
of
windsor
should
step
forth
apparent
queen
the
last
and
the
most
glorious
of
such
occasions
was
the
jubilee
of
then
as
the
splendid
procession
passed
along
escorting
victoria
through
the
thronged
streets
of
london
on
her
progress
of
thanksgiving
to
paul
cathedral
the
greatness
of
her
realm
and
the
adoration
of
her
subjects
blazed
out
together
the
tears
welled
to
her
eyes
and
while
the
multitude
roared
round
her
how
kind
they
are
to
me
how
kind
they
are
she
repeated
over
and
over
again
that
night
her
message
flew
over
the
empire
from
my
heart
i
thank
my
beloved
people
may
god
bless
them
the
long
journey
was
nearly
done
but
the
traveller
who
had
come
so
far
and
through
such
strange
experiences
moved
on
with
the
old
unfaltering
step
the
girl
the
wife
the
aged
woman
were
the
same
vitality
conscientiousness
pride
and
simplicity
were
hers
to
the
latest
hour
chapter
x
the
end
the
evening
had
been
golden
but
after
all
the
day
was
to
close
in
cloud
and
tempest
imperial
needs
imperial
ambitions
involved
the
country
in
the
south
african
war
there
were
checks
reverses
bloody
disasters
for
a
moment
the
nation
was
shaken
and
the
public
distresses
were
felt
with
intimate
solicitude
by
the
queen
but
her
spirit
was
high
and
neither
her
courage
nor
her
confidence
wavered
for
a
moment
throwing
her
self
heart
and
soul
into
the
struggle
she
laboured
with
redoubled
vigour
interested
herself
in
every
detail
of
the
hostilities
and
sought
by
every
means
in
her
power
to
render
service
to
the
national
cause
in
april
when
she
was
in
her
year
she
made
the
extraordinary
decision
to
abandon
her
annual
visit
to
the
south
of
france
and
to
go
instead
to
ireland
which
had
provided
a
particularly
large
number
of
recruits
to
the
armies
in
the
field
she
stayed
for
three
weeks
in
dublin
driving
through
the
streets
in
spite
of
the
warnings
of
her
advisers
without
an
armed
escort
and
the
visit
was
a
complete
success
but
in
the
course
of
it
she
began
for
the
first
time
to
show
signs
of
the
fatigue
of
age
for
the
long
strain
and
the
unceasing
anxiety
brought
by
the
war
made
themselves
felt
at
last
endowed
by
nature
with
a
robust
constitution
victoria
though
in
periods
of
depression
she
had
sometimes
supposed
herself
an
invalid
had
in
reality
throughout
her
life
enjoyed
remarkably
good
health
in
her
old
age
she
had
suffered
from
a
rheumatic
stiffness
of
the
joints
which
had
necessitated
the
use
of
a
stick
and
eventually
a
wheeled
chair
but
no
other
ailments
attacked
her
until
in
her
eyesight
began
to
be
affected
by
incipient
cataract
after
that
she
found
reading
more
and
more
difficult
though
she
could
still
sign
her
name
and
even
with
some
difficulty
write
letters
in
the
summer
of
however
more
serious
symptoms
appeared
her
memory
in
whose
strength
and
precision
she
had
so
long
prided
herself
now
sometimes
deserted
her
there
was
a
tendency
towards
aphasia
and
while
no
specific
disease
declared
itself
by
the
autumn
there
were
unmistakable
signs
of
a
general
physical
decay
yet
even
in
these
last
months
the
strain
of
iron
held
firm
the
daily
work
continued
nay
it
actually
increased
for
the
queen
with
an
astonishing
pertinacity
insisted
upon
communicating
personally
with
an
multitude
of
men
and
women
who
had
suffered
through
the
war
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
last
remains
of
her
ebbing
strength
had
almost
deserted
her
and
through
the
early
days
of
the
opening
century
it
was
clear
that
her
dwindling
forces
were
only
kept
together
by
an
effort
of
will
on
january
she
had
at
osborne
an
hour
interview
with
lord
roberts
who
had
returned
victorious
from
south
africa
a
few
days
before
she
inquired
with
acute
anxiety
into
all
the
details
of
the
war
she
appeared
to
sustain
the
exertion
successfully
but
when
the
audience
was
over
there
was
a
collapse
on
the
following
day
her
medical
attendants
recognised
that
her
state
was
hopeless
and
yet
for
two
days
more
the
indomitable
spirit
fought
on
for
two
days
more
she
discharged
the
duties
of
a
queen
of
england
but
after
that
there
was
an
end
of
working
and
then
and
not
till
then
did
the
last
optimism
of
those
about
her
break
down
the
brain
was
failing
and
life
was
gently
slipping
away
her
family
gathered
round
her
for
a
little
more
she
lingered
speechless
and
apparently
insensible
and
on
january
she
died
when
two
days
previously
the
news
of
the
approaching
end
had
been
made
public
astonished
grief
had
swept
over
the
country
it
appeared
as
if
some
monstrous
reversal
of
the
course
of
nature
was
about
to
take
place
the
vast
majority
of
her
subjects
had
never
known
a
time
when
queen
victoria
had
not
been
reigning
over
them
she
had
become
an
indissoluble
part
of
their
whole
scheme
of
things
and
that
they
were
about
to
lose
her
appeared
a
scarcely
possible
thought
she
herself
as
she
lay
blind
and
silent
seemed
to
those
who
watched
her
to
be
divested
of
all
thinking
to
have
glided
already
unawares
into
oblivion
yet
perhaps
in
the
secret
chambers
of
consciousness
she
had
her
thoughts
too
perhaps
her
fading
mind
called
up
once
more
the
shadows
of
the
past
to
float
before
it
and
retraced
for
the
last
time
the
vanished
visions
of
that
long
history
passing
back
and
back
through
the
cloud
of
years
to
older
and
ever
older
memories
