dedication
to
jacques
strunz
my
dear
strunz
i
should
be
ungrateful
if
i
did
not
set
your
name
at
the
head
of
one
of
the
two
tales
i
could
never
have
written
but
for
your
patient
kindness
and
care
accept
this
as
my
grateful
acknowledgment
of
the
readiness
with
which
you
tried
perhaps
not
very
successfully
to
initiate
me
into
the
mysteries
of
musical
knowledge
you
have
at
least
taught
me
what
difficulties
and
what
labor
genius
must
bury
in
those
poems
which
procure
us
transcendental
pleasures
you
have
also
afforded
me
the
satisfaction
of
laughing
more
than
once
at
the
expense
of
a
connoisseur
some
have
taxed
me
with
ignorance
not
knowing
that
i
have
taken
counsel
of
one
of
our
best
musical
critics
and
had
the
benefit
of
your
conscientious
help
i
have
perhaps
been
an
inaccurate
amanuensis
if
this
were
the
case
i
should
be
the
traitorous
translator
without
knowing
it
and
i
yet
hope
to
sign
myself
always
one
of
your
friends
de
balzac
massimilla
doni
as
all
who
are
learned
in
such
matters
know
the
venetian
aristocracy
is
the
first
in
europe
its
d
dates
from
before
the
crusades
from
a
time
when
venice
a
survivor
of
imperial
and
christian
rome
which
had
flung
itself
into
the
waters
to
escape
the
barbarians
was
already
powerful
and
illustrious
and
the
head
of
the
political
and
commercial
world
with
a
few
rare
exceptions
this
brilliant
nobility
has
fallen
into
utter
ruin
among
the
gondoliers
who
serve
the
english
to
whom
history
here
reads
the
lesson
of
their
future
fate
there
are
descendants
of
long
dead
doges
whose
names
are
older
than
those
of
sovereigns
on
some
bridge
as
you
glide
past
it
if
you
are
ever
in
venice
you
may
admire
some
lovely
girl
in
rags
a
poor
child
belonging
perhaps
to
one
of
the
most
famous
patrician
families
when
a
nation
of
kings
has
fallen
so
low
naturally
some
curious
characters
will
be
met
with
it
is
not
surprising
that
sparks
should
flash
out
among
the
ashes
these
reflections
intended
to
justify
the
singularity
of
the
persons
who
figure
in
this
narrative
shall
not
be
indulged
in
any
longer
for
there
is
nothing
more
intolerable
than
the
stale
reminiscences
of
those
who
insist
on
talking
about
venice
after
so
many
great
poets
and
petty
travelers
the
interest
of
the
tale
requires
only
this
record
of
the
most
startling
contrast
in
the
life
of
man
the
dignity
and
poverty
which
are
conspicuous
there
in
some
of
the
men
as
they
are
in
most
of
the
houses
the
nobles
of
venice
and
of
geneva
like
those
of
poland
in
former
times
bore
no
titles
to
be
named
quirini
doria
brignole
morosini
sauli
mocenigo
fieschi
cornaro
or
spinola
was
enough
for
the
pride
of
the
haughtiest
but
all
things
become
corrupt
at
the
present
day
some
of
these
families
have
titles
and
even
at
a
time
when
the
nobles
of
the
aristocratic
republics
were
all
equal
the
title
of
prince
was
in
fact
given
at
genoa
to
a
member
of
the
doria
family
who
were
sovereigns
of
the
principality
of
amalfi
and
a
similar
title
was
in
use
at
venice
justified
by
ancient
inheritance
from
facino
cane
prince
of
varese
the
grimaldi
who
assumed
sovereignty
did
not
take
possession
of
monaco
till
much
later
the
last
cane
of
the
elder
branch
vanished
from
venice
thirty
years
before
the
fall
of
the
republic
condemned
for
various
crimes
more
or
less
criminal
the
branch
on
whom
this
nominal
principality
then
devolved
the
cane
memmi
sank
into
poverty
during
the
fatal
period
between
and
in
the
twentieth
year
of
the
present
century
they
were
represented
only
by
a
young
man
whose
name
was
emilio
and
an
old
palace
which
is
regarded
as
one
of
the
chief
ornaments
of
the
grand
canal
this
son
of
venice
the
fair
had
for
his
whole
fortune
this
useless
palazzo
and
fifteen
hundred
francs
a
year
derived
from
a
country
house
on
the
brenta
the
last
plot
of
the
lands
his
family
had
formerly
owned
on
and
sold
to
the
austrian
government
this
little
income
spared
our
handsome
emilio
the
ignominy
of
accepting
as
many
nobles
did
the
indemnity
of
a
franc
a
day
due
to
every
impoverished
patrician
under
the
stipulations
of
the
cession
to
austria
at
the
beginning
of
winter
this
young
gentleman
was
still
lingering
in
a
country
house
situated
at
the
base
of
the
tyrolese
alps
and
purchased
in
the
previous
spring
by
the
duchess
cataneo
the
house
erected
by
palladio
for
the
piepolo
family
is
a
square
building
of
the
finest
style
of
architecture
there
is
a
stately
staircase
with
a
marble
portico
on
each
side
the
vestibules
are
crowded
with
frescoes
and
made
light
by
ceilings
across
which
graceful
figures
float
amid
ornament
rich
in
design
but
so
well
proportioned
that
the
building
carries
it
as
a
woman
carries
her
with
an
ease
that
charms
the
eye
in
short
the
grace
and
dignity
that
characterize
the
in
the
piazetta
at
venice
stone
walls
admirably
decorated
keep
the
rooms
at
a
pleasantly
cool
temperature
verandas
outside
painted
in
fresco
screen
off
the
glare
the
flooring
throughout
is
the
old
venetian
inlay
of
marbles
cut
into
unfading
flowers
the
furniture
like
that
of
all
italian
palaces
was
rich
with
handsome
silks
judiciously
employed
and
valuable
pictures
favorably
hung
some
by
the
genoese
priest
known
as
several
by
leonardo
da
vinci
carlo
dolci
tintoretto
and
titian
the
shelving
gardens
were
full
of
the
marvels
where
money
has
been
turned
into
rocky
grottoes
and
patterns
of
shells
the
very
madness
of
craftsmanship
terraces
laid
out
by
the
fairies
arbors
of
sterner
aspect
where
the
cypress
on
its
tall
trunk
the
triangular
pines
and
the
melancholy
olive
mingled
pleasingly
with
orange
trees
bays
and
myrtles
and
clear
pools
in
which
blue
or
russet
fishes
swam
whatever
may
be
said
in
favor
of
the
natural
or
english
garden
these
trees
pruned
into
parasols
and
yews
fantastically
clipped
this
luxury
of
art
so
skilfully
combined
with
that
of
nature
in
court
dress
those
cascades
over
marble
steps
where
the
water
spreads
so
shyly
a
filmy
scarf
swept
aside
by
the
wind
and
immediately
renewed
those
bronzed
metal
figures
speechlessly
inhabiting
the
silent
grove
that
lordly
palace
an
object
in
the
landscape
from
every
side
raising
its
light
outline
at
the
foot
of
the
alps
all
the
living
thoughts
which
animate
the
stone
the
bronze
and
the
trees
or
express
themselves
in
garden
plots
this
lavish
prodigality
was
in
perfect
keeping
with
the
loves
of
a
duchess
and
a
handsome
youth
for
they
are
a
poem
far
removed
from
the
coarse
ends
of
brutal
nature
any
one
with
a
soul
for
fantasy
would
have
looked
to
see
on
one
of
those
noble
flights
of
steps
standing
by
a
vase
with
medallions
in
a
negro
boy
swathed
about
the
loins
with
scarlet
stuff
and
holding
in
one
hand
a
parasol
over
the
duchess
head
and
in
the
other
the
train
of
her
long
skirt
while
she
listened
to
emilio
memmi
and
how
far
grander
the
venetian
would
have
looked
in
such
a
dress
as
the
senators
wore
whom
titian
painted
but
alas
in
this
fairy
palace
not
unlike
that
of
the
peschieri
at
genoa
the
duchess
cataneo
obeyed
the
edicts
of
victorine
and
the
paris
fashions
she
had
on
a
muslin
dress
and
broad
straw
hat
pretty
shot
silk
shoes
thread
lace
stockings
that
a
breath
of
air
would
have
blown
away
and
over
her
shoulders
a
black
lace
shawl
but
the
thing
which
no
one
could
ever
understand
in
paris
where
women
are
sheathed
in
their
dresses
as
a
is
cased
in
its
annular
armor
was
the
perfect
freedom
with
which
this
lovely
daughter
of
tuscany
wore
her
french
attire
she
had
italianized
it
a
frenchwoman
treats
her
shirt
with
the
greatest
seriousness
an
italian
never
thinks
about
it
she
does
not
attempt
by
some
prim
glance
for
she
knows
that
she
is
safe
in
that
of
a
devoted
love
a
passion
as
sacred
and
serious
in
her
eyes
as
in
those
of
others
at
eleven
in
the
forenoon
after
a
walk
and
by
the
side
of
a
table
still
strewn
with
the
remains
of
an
elegant
breakfast
the
duchess
lounging
in
an
left
her
lover
the
master
of
these
muslin
draperies
without
a
frown
each
time
he
moved
emilio
seated
at
her
side
held
one
of
her
hands
between
his
gazing
at
her
with
utter
absorption
ask
not
whether
they
loved
they
loved
only
too
well
they
were
not
reading
out
of
the
same
book
like
paolo
and
francesca
far
from
it
emilio
dared
not
say
let
us
the
gleam
of
those
eyes
those
glistening
gray
irises
streaked
with
threads
of
gold
that
started
from
the
centre
like
rifts
of
light
giving
her
gaze
a
soft
radiance
thrilled
him
with
nervous
rapture
that
was
almost
a
spasm
sometimes
the
mere
sight
of
the
splendid
black
hair
that
crowned
the
adored
head
bound
by
a
simple
gold
fillet
and
falling
in
satin
tresses
on
each
side
of
a
spacious
brow
was
enough
to
give
him
a
ringing
in
his
ears
the
wild
tide
of
the
blood
rushing
through
his
veins
as
if
it
must
burst
his
heart
by
what
obscure
phenomenon
did
his
soul
so
overmaster
his
body
that
he
was
no
longer
conscious
of
his
independent
self
but
was
wholly
one
with
this
woman
at
the
least
word
she
spoke
in
that
voice
which
disturbed
the
very
sources
of
life
in
him
if
in
utter
seclusion
a
woman
of
moderate
charms
can
by
being
constantly
studied
seem
supreme
and
imposing
perhaps
one
so
magnificently
handsome
as
the
duchess
could
fascinate
to
stupidity
a
youth
in
whom
rapture
found
some
fresh
incitement
for
she
had
really
absorbed
his
young
soul
massimilla
the
heiress
of
the
doni
of
florence
had
married
the
sicilian
duke
cataneo
her
mother
since
dead
had
hoped
by
promoting
this
marriage
to
leave
her
rich
and
happy
according
to
florentine
custom
she
had
concluded
that
her
daughter
emerging
from
a
convent
to
embark
in
life
would
achieve
under
the
laws
of
love
that
second
union
of
heart
with
heart
which
to
an
italian
woman
is
all
in
all
but
massimilla
doni
had
acquired
in
her
convent
a
real
taste
for
a
religious
life
and
when
she
had
pledged
her
troth
to
duke
cataneo
she
was
christianly
content
to
be
his
wife
this
was
an
untenable
position
cataneo
who
only
looked
for
a
duchess
thought
himself
ridiculous
as
a
husband
and
when
massimilla
complained
of
this
indifference
he
calmly
bid
her
look
about
her
for
a
even
offering
his
services
to
introduce
to
her
some
youths
from
whom
to
choose
the
duchess
wept
the
duke
made
his
bow
massimilla
looked
about
her
at
the
world
that
crowded
round
her
her
mother
took
her
to
the
pergola
to
some
ambassadors
to
the
cascine
wherever
handsome
young
men
of
fashion
were
to
be
met
she
saw
none
to
her
mind
and
determined
to
travel
then
she
lost
her
mother
inherited
her
property
assumed
mourning
and
made
her
way
to
venice
there
she
saw
emilio
who
as
he
went
past
her
opera
box
exchanged
with
her
a
flash
of
inquiry
this
was
all
the
venetian
was
thunderstruck
while
a
voice
in
the
duchess
ear
called
out
this
is
he
anywhere
else
two
persons
more
prudent
and
less
guileless
would
have
studied
and
examined
each
other
but
these
two
ignorances
mingled
like
two
masses
of
homogeneous
matter
which
when
they
meet
form
but
one
massimilla
was
at
once
and
thenceforth
venetian
she
bought
the
palazzo
she
had
rented
on
the
canareggio
and
then
not
knowing
how
to
invest
her
wealth
she
had
purchased
rivalta
the
where
she
was
now
staying
emilio
being
introduced
to
the
duchess
by
the
signora
vulpato
waited
very
respectfully
on
the
lady
in
her
box
all
through
the
winter
never
was
love
more
ardent
in
two
souls
or
more
bashful
in
its
advances
the
two
children
were
afraid
of
each
other
massimilla
was
no
coquette
she
had
no
second
string
to
her
bow
no
no
no
satisfied
with
a
smile
and
a
word
she
admired
her
venetian
youth
with
his
pointed
face
his
long
thin
nose
his
black
eyes
and
noble
brow
but
in
spite
of
her
artless
encouragement
he
never
went
to
her
house
till
they
had
spent
three
months
in
getting
used
to
each
other
then
summer
brought
its
eastern
sky
the
duchess
lamented
having
to
go
alone
to
rivalta
emilio
at
once
happy
and
uneasy
at
the
thought
of
being
alone
with
her
had
accompanied
massimilla
to
her
retreat
and
now
this
pretty
pair
had
been
there
for
six
months
massimilla
now
twenty
had
not
sacrificed
her
religious
principles
to
her
passion
without
a
struggle
still
they
had
yielded
though
tardily
and
at
this
moment
she
would
have
been
ready
to
consummate
the
love
union
for
which
her
mother
had
prepared
her
as
emilio
sat
there
holding
her
beautiful
aristocratic
hand
long
white
and
sheeny
ending
in
fine
rosy
nails
as
if
she
had
procured
from
asia
some
of
the
henna
with
which
the
sultan
s
wives
dye
their
fingertips
a
misfortune
of
which
she
was
unconscious
but
which
was
torture
to
emilio
kept
up
a
singular
barrier
between
them
massimilla
young
as
she
was
had
the
majestic
bearing
which
mythological
tradition
ascribes
to
juno
the
only
goddess
to
whom
it
does
not
give
a
lover
for
diana
the
chaste
diana
loved
jupiter
alone
could
hold
his
own
with
his
divine
on
whom
many
english
ladies
model
themselves
emilio
set
his
mistress
far
too
high
ever
to
touch
her
a
year
hence
perhaps
he
might
not
be
a
victim
to
this
noble
error
which
attacks
none
but
very
young
or
very
old
men
but
as
the
archer
who
shoots
beyond
the
mark
is
as
far
from
it
as
he
whose
arrow
falls
short
of
it
the
duchess
found
herself
between
a
husband
who
knew
he
was
so
far
from
reaching
the
target
that
he
had
ceased
to
try
for
it
and
a
lover
who
was
carried
so
much
past
it
on
the
white
wings
of
an
angel
that
he
could
not
get
back
to
it
massimilla
could
be
happy
with
desire
not
imagining
its
issue
but
her
lover
distressful
in
his
happiness
would
sometimes
obtain
from
his
beloved
a
promise
that
led
her
to
the
edge
of
what
many
women
call
the
gulf
and
thus
found
himself
obliged
to
be
satisfied
with
plucking
the
flowers
at
the
edge
incapable
of
daring
more
than
to
pull
off
their
petals
and
smother
his
torture
in
his
heart
they
had
wandered
out
together
that
morning
repeating
such
a
hymn
of
love
as
the
birds
warbled
in
the
branches
on
their
return
the
youth
whose
situation
can
only
be
described
by
comparing
him
to
the
cherubs
represented
by
painters
as
having
only
a
head
and
wings
had
been
so
impassioned
as
to
venture
to
hint
a
doubt
as
to
the
duchess
entire
devotion
so
as
to
bring
her
to
the
point
of
saying
what
proof
do
you
need
the
question
had
been
asked
with
a
royal
air
and
memmi
had
ardently
kissed
the
beautiful
and
guileless
hand
then
he
suddenly
started
up
in
a
rage
with
himself
and
left
the
duchess
massimilla
remained
in
her
indolent
attitude
on
the
sofa
but
she
wept
wondering
how
young
and
handsome
as
she
was
she
could
fail
to
please
emilio
memmi
on
the
other
hand
knocked
his
head
against
the
like
a
hooded
crow
but
at
this
moment
a
servant
came
in
pursuit
of
the
young
venetian
to
deliver
a
letter
brought
by
express
messenger
marco
vendramini
a
name
also
pronounced
vendramin
in
the
venetian
dialect
which
drops
many
final
letters
his
only
friend
wrote
to
tell
him
that
facino
cane
prince
of
varese
had
died
in
a
hospital
in
paris
proofs
of
his
death
had
come
to
hand
and
the
were
princes
of
varese
in
the
eyes
of
the
two
young
men
a
title
without
wealth
being
worthless
vendramin
also
informed
emilio
as
a
far
more
important
fact
of
the
engagement
at
the
of
the
famous
tenor
genovese
and
the
no
less
famous
signora
tinti
without
waiting
to
finish
the
letter
which
he
crumpled
up
and
put
in
his
pocket
emilio
ran
to
communicate
this
great
news
to
the
duchess
forgetting
his
heraldic
honors
the
duchess
knew
nothing
of
the
strange
story
which
made
la
tinti
an
object
of
curiosity
in
italy
and
emilio
briefly
repeated
it
this
illustrious
singer
had
been
a
mere
whose
wonderful
voice
had
captivated
a
great
sicilian
nobleman
on
his
travels
the
girl
s
beauty
she
was
then
twelve
years
old
being
worthy
of
her
voice
the
gentleman
had
had
the
moderation
to
have
brought
her
up
as
louis
xv
had
mademoiselle
de
romans
educated
he
had
waited
patiently
till
clara
s
voice
had
been
fully
trained
by
a
famous
professor
and
till
she
was
sixteen
before
taking
toll
of
the
treasure
so
carefully
cultivated
la
tinti
had
made
her
debut
the
year
before
and
had
enchanted
the
three
most
fastidious
capitals
of
italy
i
am
perfectly
certain
that
her
great
nobleman
is
not
my
husband
said
the
duchess
the
horses
were
ordered
and
the
duchess
set
out
at
once
for
venice
to
be
present
at
the
opening
of
the
winter
season
so
one
fine
evening
in
november
the
new
prince
of
varese
was
crossing
the
lagoon
from
mestre
to
venice
between
the
lines
of
stakes
painted
with
austrian
colors
which
mark
out
the
channel
for
gondolas
as
conceded
by
the
as
he
watched
massimilla
s
gondola
navigated
by
men
in
livery
and
cutting
through
the
water
a
few
yards
in
front
poor
emilio
with
only
an
old
gondolier
who
had
been
his
father
s
servant
in
the
days
when
venice
was
still
a
living
city
could
not
repress
the
bitter
reflections
suggested
to
him
by
the
assumption
of
his
title
what
a
mockery
of
fortune
a
prince
with
fifteen
hundred
francs
a
year
master
of
one
of
the
finest
palaces
in
the
world
and
unable
to
sell
the
statues
stairs
paintings
sculpture
which
an
austrian
decree
had
made
inalienable
to
live
on
a
foundation
of
piles
of
campeachy
wood
worth
nearly
a
million
of
francs
and
have
no
furniture
to
own
sumptuous
galleries
and
live
in
an
attic
above
the
topmost
arabesque
cornice
constructed
of
marble
brought
from
the
morea
the
land
which
a
memmius
had
marched
over
as
conqueror
in
the
time
of
the
romans
to
see
his
ancestors
in
effigy
on
their
tombs
of
precious
marbles
in
one
of
the
most
splendid
churches
in
venice
and
in
a
chapel
graced
with
pictures
by
titian
and
tintoretto
by
palma
bellini
paul
veronese
and
to
be
prohibited
from
selling
a
marble
memmi
to
the
english
for
bread
for
the
living
prince
varese
genovese
the
famous
tenor
could
get
in
one
season
by
his
warbling
the
capital
of
an
income
on
which
this
son
of
the
memmi
could
live
this
descendant
of
roman
senators
as
venerable
as
caesar
and
sylla
genovese
may
smoke
an
eastern
hookah
and
the
prince
of
varese
can
not
even
have
enough
cigars
he
tossed
the
end
he
was
smoking
into
the
sea
the
prince
of
varese
found
cigars
at
the
duchess
cataneo
s
how
gladly
would
he
have
laid
the
treasures
of
the
world
at
her
feet
she
studied
all
his
caprices
and
was
happy
to
gratify
them
he
made
his
only
meal
at
her
house
his
supper
for
all
his
money
was
spent
in
clothes
and
his
place
in
the
he
had
also
to
pay
a
hundred
francs
a
year
as
wages
to
his
father
s
old
gondolier
and
he
to
serve
him
for
that
sum
had
to
live
exclusively
on
rice
also
he
kept
enough
to
take
a
cup
of
black
coffee
every
morning
at
florian
s
to
keep
himself
up
till
the
evening
in
a
state
of
nervous
excitement
and
this
habit
carried
to
excess
he
hoped
would
in
due
time
kill
him
as
vendramin
relied
on
opium
and
i
am
a
prince
as
he
spoke
the
words
emilio
memmi
tossed
marco
vendramin
s
letter
into
the
lagoon
without
even
reading
it
to
the
end
and
it
floated
away
like
a
paper
boat
launched
by
a
child
but
emilio
he
went
on
to
himself
is
but
three
and
twenty
he
is
a
better
man
than
lord
wellington
with
the
gout
than
the
paralyzed
regent
than
the
epileptic
royal
family
of
austria
than
the
king
of
france
but
as
he
thought
of
the
king
of
france
emilio
s
brow
was
knit
his
ivory
skin
burned
yellower
tears
gathered
in
his
black
eyes
and
hung
to
his
long
lashes
he
raised
a
hand
worthy
to
be
painted
by
titian
to
push
back
his
thick
brown
hair
and
gazed
again
at
massimilla
s
gondola
and
this
insolent
mockery
of
fate
is
carried
even
into
my
love
affair
said
he
to
himself
my
heart
and
imagination
are
full
of
precious
gifts
massimilla
will
have
none
of
them
she
is
a
florentine
and
she
will
throw
me
over
i
have
to
sit
by
her
side
like
ice
while
her
voice
and
her
looks
fire
me
with
heavenly
sensations
as
i
watch
her
gondola
a
few
hundred
feet
away
from
my
own
i
feel
as
if
a
hot
iron
were
set
on
my
heart
an
invisible
fluid
courses
through
my
frame
and
scorches
my
nerves
a
cloud
dims
my
sight
the
air
seems
to
me
to
glow
as
it
did
at
rivalta
when
the
sunlight
came
through
a
red
silk
blind
and
i
without
her
knowing
it
could
admire
her
lost
in
dreams
with
her
subtle
smile
like
that
of
leonardo
s
mona
lisa
well
either
my
highness
will
end
my
days
by
a
or
the
heir
of
the
cane
will
follow
old
carmagnola
s
advice
we
will
be
sailors
pirates
and
it
will
be
amusing
to
see
how
long
we
can
live
without
being
the
prince
lighted
another
cigar
and
watched
the
curls
of
smoke
as
the
wind
wafted
them
away
as
though
he
saw
in
their
arabesques
an
echo
of
this
last
thought
in
the
distance
he
could
now
perceive
the
mauresque
pinnacles
that
crowned
his
palazzo
and
he
was
sadder
than
ever
the
duchess
gondola
had
vanished
in
the
canareggio
these
fantastic
pictures
of
a
romantic
and
perilous
existence
as
the
outcome
of
his
love
went
out
with
his
cigar
and
his
lady
s
gondola
no
longer
traced
his
path
then
he
saw
the
present
in
its
real
light
a
palace
without
a
soul
a
soul
that
had
no
effect
on
the
body
a
principality
without
money
an
empty
body
and
a
full
heart
a
thousand
heartbreaking
contradictions
the
hapless
youth
mourned
for
venice
as
she
had
been
as
did
vendramini
even
more
bitterly
for
it
was
a
great
and
common
sorrow
a
similar
destiny
that
had
engendered
such
a
warm
friendship
between
these
two
young
men
the
wreckage
of
two
illustrious
families
emilio
could
not
help
dreaming
of
a
time
when
the
palazzo
memmi
poured
out
light
from
every
window
and
rang
with
music
carried
far
away
over
the
adriatic
tide
when
hundreds
of
gondolas
might
be
seen
tied
up
to
its
while
graceful
masked
figures
and
the
magnates
of
the
republic
crowded
up
the
steps
kissed
by
the
waters
when
its
halls
and
gallery
were
full
of
a
throng
of
intriguers
or
their
dupes
when
the
great
filled
with
merry
feasters
and
the
upper
balconies
furnished
with
musicians
seemed
to
harbor
all
venice
coming
and
going
on
the
great
staircase
that
rang
with
laughter
the
chisels
of
the
greatest
artists
of
many
centuries
had
sculptured
the
bronze
brackets
supporting
or
chinese
vases
and
the
candelabra
for
a
thousand
tapers
every
country
had
furnished
some
contribution
to
the
splendor
that
decked
the
walls
and
ceilings
but
now
the
panels
were
stripped
of
the
handsome
hangings
the
melancholy
ceilings
were
speechless
and
sad
no
turkey
carpets
no
lustres
bright
with
flowers
no
statues
no
pictures
no
more
joy
no
money
the
great
means
to
enjoyment
venice
the
london
of
the
middle
ages
was
falling
stone
by
stone
man
by
man
the
ominous
green
weed
which
the
sea
washes
and
kisses
at
the
foot
of
every
palace
was
in
the
prince
s
eyes
a
black
fringe
hung
by
nature
as
an
omen
of
death
and
finally
a
great
english
poet
had
rushed
down
on
venice
like
a
raven
on
a
corpse
to
croak
out
in
lyric
poetry
the
first
and
last
utterance
of
social
man
the
burden
of
a
english
poetry
flung
in
the
face
of
the
city
that
had
given
birth
to
italian
poetry
poor
venice
conceive
then
of
the
young
man
s
amazement
when
roused
from
such
meditations
by
carmagnola
s
cry
serenissimo
the
palazzo
is
on
fire
or
the
old
doges
have
risen
from
their
tombs
there
are
lights
in
the
windows
of
the
upper
floor
prince
emilio
fancied
that
his
dream
was
realized
by
the
touch
of
a
magic
wand
it
was
dusk
and
the
old
gondolier
could
by
tying
up
his
gondola
to
the
top
step
help
his
young
master
to
land
without
being
seen
by
the
bustling
servants
in
the
palazzo
some
of
whom
were
buzzing
about
the
like
bees
at
the
door
of
a
hive
emilio
stole
into
the
great
hall
whence
rose
the
finest
flight
of
stairs
in
all
venice
up
which
he
lightly
ran
to
investigate
the
cause
of
this
strange
bustle
a
whole
tribe
of
workmen
were
hurriedly
completing
the
furnishing
and
redecoration
of
the
palace
the
first
floor
worthy
of
the
antique
glories
of
venice
displayed
to
emilio
s
waking
eyes
the
magnificence
of
which
he
had
just
been
dreaming
and
the
fairy
had
exercised
admirable
taste
splendor
worthy
of
a
parvenu
sovereign
was
to
be
seen
even
in
the
smallest
details
emilio
wandered
about
without
remark
from
anybody
and
surprise
followed
on
surprise
curious
then
to
know
what
was
going
forward
on
the
second
floor
he
went
up
and
found
everything
finished
the
unknown
laborers
commissioned
by
a
wizard
to
revive
the
marvels
of
the
arabian
nights
in
behalf
of
an
impoverished
italian
prince
were
exchanging
some
inferior
articles
of
furniture
brought
in
for
the
nonce
prince
emilio
made
his
way
into
the
bedroom
which
smiled
on
him
like
a
shell
just
deserted
by
venus
the
room
was
so
charmingly
pretty
so
daintily
smart
so
full
of
elegant
contrivance
that
he
straightway
seated
himself
in
an
armchair
of
gilt
wood
in
front
of
which
a
most
appetizing
cold
supper
stood
ready
and
without
more
ado
proceeded
to
eat
in
all
the
world
there
is
no
one
but
massimilla
who
would
have
thought
of
this
surprise
thought
he
she
heard
that
i
was
now
a
prince
duke
cataneo
is
perhaps
dead
and
has
left
her
his
fortune
she
is
twice
as
rich
as
she
was
she
will
marry
me
and
he
ate
in
a
way
that
would
have
roused
the
envy
of
an
invalid
croesus
if
he
could
have
seen
him
and
he
drank
floods
of
capital
port
wine
now
i
understand
the
knowing
little
air
she
put
on
as
she
said
till
this
evening
perhaps
she
means
to
come
and
break
the
spell
what
a
fine
bed
and
in
the
such
a
pretty
lamp
quite
a
florentine
idea
there
are
some
strongly
blended
natures
on
which
extremes
of
joy
or
of
grief
have
a
soporific
effect
now
on
a
youth
so
compounded
that
he
could
idealize
his
mistress
to
the
point
of
ceasing
to
think
of
her
as
a
woman
this
sudden
incursion
of
wealth
had
the
effect
of
a
dose
of
opium
when
the
prince
had
drunk
the
whole
of
the
bottle
of
port
eaten
half
a
fish
and
some
portion
of
a
french
pate
he
felt
an
irresistible
longing
for
bed
perhaps
he
was
suffering
from
a
double
intoxication
so
he
pulled
off
the
counterpane
opened
the
bed
undressed
in
a
pretty
and
lay
down
to
meditate
on
destiny
i
forgot
poor
carmagnola
said
he
but
my
cook
and
butler
will
have
provided
for
at
this
juncture
a
came
in
lightly
humming
an
air
from
the
she
tossed
a
woman
s
dress
on
a
chair
a
whole
outfit
for
the
night
and
said
as
she
did
so
here
they
come
and
in
fact
a
few
minutes
later
a
young
lady
came
in
dressed
in
the
latest
french
style
who
might
have
sat
for
some
english
fancy
portrait
engraved
for
a
a
or
a
of
the
prince
shivered
with
delight
and
with
fear
for
as
you
know
he
was
in
love
with
massimilla
but
in
spite
of
this
faith
in
love
which
fired
his
blood
and
which
of
old
inspired
the
painters
of
spain
which
gave
italy
her
madonnas
created
michael
angelo
s
statues
and
ghilberti
s
doors
of
the
baptistery
desire
had
him
in
its
toils
and
agitated
him
without
infusing
into
his
heart
that
warm
ethereal
glow
which
he
felt
at
a
look
or
a
word
from
the
duchess
his
soul
his
heart
his
reason
every
impulse
of
his
will
revolted
at
the
thought
of
an
infidelity
and
yet
that
brutal
unreasoning
infidelity
domineered
over
his
spirit
but
the
woman
was
not
alone
the
prince
saw
one
of
those
figures
in
which
nobody
believes
when
they
are
transferred
from
real
life
where
we
wonder
at
them
to
the
imaginary
existence
of
a
more
or
less
literary
description
the
dress
of
this
stranger
like
that
of
all
neapolitans
displayed
five
colors
if
the
black
of
his
hat
may
count
for
a
color
his
trousers
were
his
red
waistcoat
shone
with
gilt
buttons
his
coat
was
greenish
and
his
linen
was
more
yellow
than
white
this
personage
seemed
to
have
made
it
his
business
to
verify
the
neapolitan
as
represented
by
gerolamo
on
the
stage
of
his
puppet
show
his
eyes
looked
like
glass
beads
his
nose
like
the
ace
of
clubs
was
horribly
long
and
bulbous
in
fact
it
did
its
best
to
conceal
an
opening
which
it
would
be
an
insult
to
the
human
countenance
to
call
a
mouth
within
three
or
four
tusks
were
visible
endowed
as
it
seemed
with
a
proper
motion
and
fitting
into
each
other
his
fleshy
ears
drooped
by
their
own
weight
giving
the
creature
a
whimsical
resemblance
to
a
dog
his
complexion
tainted
no
doubt
by
various
metallic
infusions
as
prescribed
by
some
hippocrates
verged
on
black
a
pointed
skull
scarcely
covered
by
a
few
straight
hairs
like
spun
glass
crowned
this
forbidding
face
with
red
spots
finally
though
the
man
was
very
thin
and
of
medium
height
he
had
long
arms
and
broad
shoulders
in
spite
of
these
hideous
details
and
though
he
looked
fully
seventy
he
did
not
lack
a
certain
cyclopean
dignity
he
had
aristocratic
manners
and
the
confident
demeanor
of
a
rich
man
any
one
who
could
have
found
courage
enough
to
study
him
would
have
seen
his
history
written
by
base
passions
on
this
noble
clay
degraded
to
mud
here
was
the
man
of
high
birth
who
rich
from
his
earliest
youth
had
given
up
his
body
to
debauchery
for
the
sake
of
extravagant
enjoyment
and
debauchery
had
destroyed
the
human
being
and
made
another
after
its
own
image
thousands
of
bottles
of
wine
had
disappeared
under
the
purple
archway
of
that
preposterous
nose
and
left
their
dregs
on
his
lips
long
and
slow
digestion
had
destroyed
his
teeth
his
eyes
had
grown
dim
under
the
lamps
of
the
gaming
table
the
blood
tainted
with
impurities
had
vitiated
the
nervous
system
the
expenditure
of
force
in
the
task
of
digestion
had
undermined
his
intellect
finally
amours
had
thinned
his
hair
each
vice
like
a
greedy
heir
had
stamped
possession
on
some
part
of
the
living
body
those
who
watch
nature
detect
her
in
jests
of
the
shrewdest
irony
for
instance
she
places
toads
in
the
neighborhood
of
flowers
as
she
had
placed
this
man
by
the
side
of
this
rose
of
love
will
you
play
the
violin
this
evening
my
dear
duke
asked
the
woman
as
she
unhooked
a
cord
to
let
a
handsome
curtain
fall
over
the
door
play
the
violin
thought
prince
emilio
what
can
have
happened
to
my
palazzo
am
i
awake
here
i
am
in
that
woman
s
bed
and
she
certainly
thinks
herself
at
home
she
has
taken
off
her
cloak
have
i
like
vendramin
inhaled
opium
and
am
i
in
the
midst
of
one
of
those
dreams
in
which
he
sees
venice
as
it
was
three
centuries
ago
the
unknown
fair
one
seated
in
front
of
a
blazing
with
wax
lights
was
unfastening
her
frippery
with
the
utmost
calmness
ring
for
giulia
said
she
i
want
to
get
my
dress
at
that
instant
the
duke
noticed
that
the
supper
had
been
disturbed
he
looked
round
the
room
and
discovered
the
prince
s
trousers
hanging
over
a
chair
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
clarina
i
will
not
ring
cried
the
duke
in
a
shrill
voice
of
fury
i
will
not
play
the
violin
this
evening
nor
tomorrow
nor
ever
again
ta
ta
ta
ta
sang
clarina
on
the
four
octaves
of
the
same
note
leaping
from
one
to
the
next
with
the
ease
of
a
nightingale
in
spite
of
that
voice
which
would
make
your
patron
saint
clara
envious
you
are
really
too
impudent
you
rascally
hussy
you
have
not
brought
me
up
to
listen
to
such
abuse
said
she
with
some
pride
have
i
brought
you
up
to
hide
a
man
in
your
bed
you
are
unworthy
alike
of
my
generosity
and
of
my
hatred
a
man
in
my
bed
exclaimed
clarina
hastily
looking
round
and
after
daring
to
eat
our
supper
as
if
he
were
at
home
added
the
duke
but
am
i
not
at
home
cried
emilio
i
am
the
prince
of
varese
this
palace
is
as
he
spoke
emilio
sat
up
in
bed
his
handsome
and
noble
venetian
head
framed
in
the
flowing
hangings
at
first
clarina
laughed
one
of
those
irrepressible
fits
of
laughter
which
seize
a
girl
when
she
meets
with
an
adventure
comic
beyond
all
conception
but
her
laughter
ceased
as
she
saw
the
young
man
who
as
has
been
said
was
remarkably
handsome
though
but
lightly
attired
the
madness
that
possessed
emilio
seized
her
too
and
as
she
had
no
one
to
adore
no
sense
of
reason
bridled
her
sudden
fancy
a
sicilian
woman
in
love
although
this
is
the
palazzo
memmi
i
will
thank
your
highness
to
quit
said
the
duke
assuming
the
cold
irony
of
a
polished
gentleman
i
am
at
home
let
me
tell
you
monsieur
le
duc
that
you
are
in
my
room
not
in
your
own
said
clarina
rousing
herself
from
her
amazement
if
you
have
any
doubts
of
my
virtue
at
any
rate
give
me
the
benefit
of
my
crime
doubts
say
proof
positive
my
lady
i
swear
to
you
that
i
am
innocent
replied
clarina
what
then
do
i
see
in
that
bed
asked
the
duke
old
ogre
cried
clarina
if
you
believe
your
eyes
rather
than
my
assertion
you
have
ceased
to
love
me
go
and
do
not
weary
my
ears
do
you
hear
go
monsieur
le
duc
this
young
prince
will
repay
you
the
million
francs
i
have
cost
you
if
you
i
will
repay
nothing
said
emilio
in
an
undertone
there
is
nothing
due
a
million
is
cheap
for
clara
tinti
when
a
man
is
so
ugly
now
go
said
she
to
the
duke
you
dismissed
me
now
i
dismiss
you
we
are
at
a
gesture
on
cataneo
s
part
as
he
seemed
inclined
to
dispute
this
order
which
was
given
with
an
action
worthy
of
semiramis
the
part
in
which
la
tinti
had
won
her
fame
the
prima
donna
flew
at
the
old
ape
and
put
him
out
of
the
room
if
you
do
not
leave
me
in
quiet
this
evening
we
never
meet
again
and
my
counts
for
more
than
yours
she
added
quiet
retorted
the
duke
with
a
bitter
laugh
dear
idol
it
strikes
me
that
i
am
leaving
you
the
duke
departed
his
mean
spirit
was
no
surprise
to
emilio
every
man
who
has
accustomed
himself
to
some
particular
taste
chosen
from
among
the
various
effects
of
love
in
harmony
with
his
own
nature
knows
that
no
consideration
can
stop
a
man
who
has
allowed
his
passions
to
become
a
habit
clarina
bounded
like
a
fawn
from
the
door
to
the
bed
a
prince
and
poor
young
and
handsome
cried
she
why
it
is
a
fairy
tale
the
sicilian
perched
herself
on
the
bed
with
the
artless
freedom
of
an
animal
the
yearning
of
a
plant
for
the
sun
the
airy
motion
of
a
branch
waltzing
to
the
breeze
as
she
unbuttoned
the
wristbands
of
her
sleeves
she
began
to
sing
not
in
the
pitch
that
won
her
the
applause
of
an
audience
at
the
but
in
a
warble
tender
with
emotion
her
song
was
a
zephyr
carrying
the
caresses
of
her
love
to
the
heart
she
stole
a
glance
at
emilio
who
was
as
much
embarrassed
as
she
for
this
woman
of
the
stage
had
lost
all
the
boldness
that
had
sparkled
in
her
eyes
and
given
decision
to
her
voice
and
gestures
when
she
dismissed
the
duke
she
was
as
humble
as
a
courtesan
who
has
fallen
in
love
to
picture
la
tinti
you
must
recall
one
of
our
best
french
singers
when
she
came
out
in
an
opera
by
garcia
that
was
then
being
played
by
an
italian
company
at
the
theatre
in
the
rue
lauvois
she
was
so
beautiful
that
a
naples
guardsman
having
failed
to
win
a
hearing
killed
himself
in
despair
the
prima
donna
of
the
had
the
same
refinement
of
features
the
same
elegant
figure
and
was
equally
young
but
she
had
in
addition
the
warm
blood
of
sicily
that
gave
a
glow
to
her
loveliness
her
voice
was
fuller
and
richer
and
she
had
that
air
of
native
majesty
that
is
characteristic
of
italian
women
la
tinti
whose
name
also
resembled
that
which
the
french
singer
assumed
was
now
seventeen
and
the
poor
prince
what
mocking
hand
had
thought
it
sport
to
bring
the
match
so
near
the
powder
a
fragrant
room
hung
with
silk
and
brilliant
with
wax
lights
a
bed
dressed
in
lace
a
silent
palace
and
venice
two
young
and
beautiful
creatures
every
ravishment
at
once
emilio
snatched
up
his
trousers
jumped
out
of
bed
escaped
into
the
put
on
his
clothes
came
back
and
hurried
to
the
door
these
were
his
thoughts
while
dressing
massimilla
beloved
daughter
of
the
doni
in
whom
italian
beauty
is
an
hereditary
prerogative
you
who
are
worthy
of
the
portrait
of
one
of
the
few
canvases
painted
entirely
by
raphael
to
his
glory
my
beautiful
and
saintly
mistress
shall
i
not
have
deserved
you
if
i
fly
from
this
abyss
of
flowers
should
i
be
worthy
of
you
if
i
profaned
a
heart
that
is
wholly
yours
no
i
will
not
fall
into
the
vulgar
snare
laid
for
me
by
my
rebellious
senses
this
girl
has
her
duke
mine
be
my
duchess
as
he
lifted
the
curtain
he
heard
a
moan
the
heroic
lover
looked
round
and
saw
clarina
on
her
knees
her
face
hidden
in
the
bed
choking
with
sobs
is
it
to
be
believed
the
singer
was
lovelier
kneeling
thus
her
face
invisible
than
even
in
her
confusion
with
a
glowing
countenance
her
hair
which
had
fallen
over
her
shoulders
her
attitude
the
disorder
of
her
dress
the
whole
picture
had
been
composed
by
the
devil
who
as
is
well
known
is
a
fine
colorist
the
prince
put
his
arm
round
the
weeping
girl
who
slipped
from
him
like
a
snake
and
clung
to
one
foot
pressing
it
to
her
beautiful
bosom
will
you
explain
to
me
said
he
shaking
his
foot
to
free
it
from
her
embrace
how
you
happen
to
be
in
my
palazzo
how
the
impoverished
emilio
memmi
emilio
memmi
cried
tinti
rising
you
said
you
were
a
a
prince
since
you
are
in
love
with
the
duchess
cataneo
said
she
looking
at
him
from
head
to
foot
emilio
stood
mute
seeing
that
the
prima
dona
was
smiling
at
him
through
her
tears
your
highness
does
not
know
that
the
man
who
had
me
trained
for
the
stage
that
the
duke
is
cataneo
himself
and
your
friend
vendramini
thinking
to
do
you
a
service
let
him
this
palace
for
a
thousand
crowns
for
the
period
of
my
season
at
the
dear
idol
of
my
heart
she
went
on
taking
his
hand
and
drawing
him
towards
her
why
do
you
fly
from
one
for
whom
many
a
man
would
run
the
risk
of
broken
bones
love
you
see
is
always
love
it
is
the
same
everywhere
it
is
the
sun
of
our
souls
we
can
warm
ourselves
whenever
it
shines
and
here
now
it
is
full
noonday
if
you
are
not
satisfied
kill
me
but
i
shall
survive
for
i
am
a
real
beauty
emilio
decided
on
remaining
when
he
signified
his
consent
by
a
nod
the
impulse
of
delight
that
sent
a
shiver
through
clarina
seemed
to
him
like
a
light
from
hell
love
had
never
before
appeared
to
him
in
so
impressive
a
form
at
that
moment
carmagnola
whistled
loudly
what
can
he
want
of
me
said
the
prince
but
bewildered
by
love
emilio
paid
no
heed
to
the
gondolier
s
repeated
signals
if
you
have
never
traveled
in
switzerland
you
may
perhaps
read
this
description
with
pleasure
and
if
you
have
clambered
among
those
mountains
you
will
not
be
sorry
to
be
reminded
of
the
scenery
in
that
sublime
land
in
the
heart
of
a
mass
of
rock
riven
by
a
gorge
a
valley
as
wide
as
the
avenue
de
neuilly
in
paris
but
a
hundred
fathoms
deep
and
broken
into
ravines
flows
a
torrent
coming
from
some
tremendous
height
of
the
on
the
simplon
which
has
formed
a
pool
i
know
not
how
many
yards
deep
or
how
many
feet
long
and
wide
hemmed
in
by
splintered
cliffs
of
granite
on
which
meadows
find
a
place
with
between
them
and
enormous
elms
and
where
violets
also
grow
and
strawberries
here
and
there
stands
a
chalet
and
at
the
window
you
may
see
the
rosy
face
of
a
swiss
girl
according
to
the
moods
of
the
sky
the
water
in
this
tarn
is
blue
and
green
but
as
a
sapphire
is
blue
as
an
emerald
is
green
well
nothing
in
the
world
can
give
such
an
idea
of
depth
peace
immensity
heavenly
love
and
eternal
happiness
to
the
most
heedless
traveler
the
most
hurried
courier
the
most
commonplace
tradesman
as
this
liquid
diamond
into
which
the
snow
gathering
from
the
highest
alps
trickles
through
a
natural
channel
hidden
under
the
trees
and
eaten
through
the
rock
escaping
below
through
a
gap
without
a
sound
the
watery
sheet
overhanging
the
fall
glides
so
gently
that
no
ripple
is
to
be
seen
on
the
surface
which
mirrors
the
chaise
as
you
drive
past
the
postboy
smacks
his
whip
you
turn
past
a
crag
you
cross
a
bridge
suddenly
there
is
a
terrific
uproar
of
cascades
tumbling
together
one
upon
another
the
water
taking
a
mighty
leap
is
broken
into
a
hundred
falls
dashed
to
spray
on
the
boulders
it
sparkles
in
a
myriad
jets
against
a
mass
that
has
fallen
from
the
heights
that
tower
over
the
ravine
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
road
that
has
been
so
irresistibly
cut
by
the
most
formidable
of
active
forces
if
you
have
formed
a
clear
idea
of
this
landscape
you
will
see
in
those
sleeping
waters
the
image
of
emilio
s
love
for
the
duchess
and
in
the
cascades
leaping
like
a
flock
of
sheep
an
idea
of
his
passion
shared
with
la
tinti
in
the
midst
of
his
torrent
of
love
a
rock
stood
up
against
which
the
torrent
broke
the
prince
like
sisyphus
was
constantly
under
the
stone
what
on
earth
does
the
duke
do
with
a
violin
he
wondered
do
i
owe
this
symphony
to
him
he
asked
clara
tinti
my
dear
child
for
she
saw
that
emilio
was
but
a
child
dear
child
said
she
that
man
who
is
a
hundred
and
eighteen
in
the
parish
register
of
vice
and
only
in
the
register
of
the
church
has
but
one
single
joy
left
to
him
in
life
yes
everything
is
broken
everything
in
him
is
ruin
or
rags
his
soul
intellect
heart
nerves
everything
in
man
that
can
supply
an
impulse
and
remind
him
of
heaven
either
by
desire
or
enjoyment
is
bound
up
with
music
or
rather
with
one
of
the
many
effects
produced
by
music
the
perfect
unison
of
two
voices
or
of
a
voice
with
the
top
string
of
his
violin
the
old
ape
sits
on
my
knee
takes
his
instrument
he
plays
fairly
well
he
produces
the
notes
and
i
try
to
imitate
them
then
when
the
moment
comes
when
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
in
the
body
of
sound
which
is
the
note
on
the
violin
and
which
proceeds
from
my
throat
the
old
man
falls
into
an
ecstasy
his
dim
eyes
light
up
with
their
last
remaining
fires
he
is
quite
happy
and
will
roll
on
the
floor
like
a
drunken
man
that
is
why
he
pays
genovese
such
a
price
genovese
is
the
only
tenor
whose
voice
occasionally
sounds
in
unison
with
mine
either
we
really
do
sing
exactly
together
once
or
twice
in
an
evening
or
the
duke
imagines
that
we
do
and
for
that
imaginary
pleasure
he
has
bought
genovese
genovese
belongs
to
him
no
theatrical
manager
can
engage
that
tenor
without
me
nor
have
me
to
sing
without
him
the
duke
brought
me
up
on
purpose
to
gratify
that
whim
to
him
i
owe
my
talent
my
beauty
my
fortune
no
doubt
he
will
die
of
an
attack
of
perfect
unison
the
sense
of
hearing
alone
has
survived
the
wreck
of
his
faculties
that
is
the
only
thread
by
which
he
holds
on
to
life
a
vigorous
shoot
springs
from
that
rotten
stump
there
are
i
am
told
many
men
in
the
same
predicament
may
madonna
preserve
them
you
have
not
come
to
that
you
can
do
all
you
want
all
i
want
of
you
i
towards
morning
the
prince
stole
away
and
found
carmagnola
lying
asleep
across
the
door
altezza
said
the
gondolier
the
duchess
ordered
me
to
give
you
this
he
held
out
a
dainty
sheet
of
paper
folded
into
a
triangle
the
prince
felt
dizzy
he
went
back
into
the
room
and
dropped
into
a
chair
for
his
sight
was
dim
and
his
hands
shook
as
he
read
dear
emilio
your
gondola
stopped
at
your
palazzo
did
you
not
know
that
cataneo
has
taken
it
for
la
tinti
if
you
love
me
go
to
vendramin
who
tells
me
he
has
a
room
ready
for
you
in
his
house
what
shall
i
do
can
i
remain
in
venice
to
see
my
husband
and
his
opera
singer
shall
we
go
back
together
to
friuli
write
me
one
word
if
only
to
tell
me
what
the
letter
was
you
tossed
into
the
lagoon
massimilla
the
writing
and
the
scent
of
the
paper
brought
a
thousand
memories
back
to
the
young
venetian
s
mind
the
sun
of
a
passion
threw
its
radiance
on
the
blue
depths
come
from
so
far
collected
in
a
bottomless
pool
and
shining
like
a
star
the
noble
youth
could
not
restrain
the
tears
that
flowed
freely
from
his
eyes
for
in
the
languid
state
produced
by
satiated
senses
he
was
disarmed
by
the
thought
of
that
purer
divinity
even
in
her
sleep
clarina
heard
his
weeping
she
sat
up
in
bed
saw
her
prince
in
a
dejected
attitude
and
threw
herself
at
his
knees
they
are
still
waiting
for
the
answer
said
carmagnola
putting
the
curtain
aside
wretch
you
have
undone
me
cried
emilio
starting
up
and
spurning
clarina
with
his
foot
she
clutched
it
so
lovingly
her
look
imploring
some
explanation
the
look
of
a
samaritan
that
emilio
enraged
to
find
himself
still
in
the
toils
of
the
passion
that
had
wrought
his
fall
pushed
away
the
singer
with
an
unmanly
kick
you
told
me
to
kill
you
then
die
venomous
reptile
he
exclaimed
he
left
the
palace
and
sprang
into
his
gondola
pull
said
he
to
carmagnola
where
asked
the
old
servant
where
you
the
gondolier
divined
his
master
s
wishes
and
by
many
windings
brought
him
at
last
into
the
canareggio
to
the
door
of
a
wonderful
palazzo
which
you
will
admire
when
you
see
venice
for
no
traveler
ever
fails
to
stop
in
front
of
those
windows
each
of
a
different
design
vying
with
each
other
in
fantastic
ornament
with
balconies
like
to
study
the
corners
finishing
in
tall
and
slender
twisted
columns
the
wrought
by
so
inventive
a
chisel
that
no
two
shapes
are
alike
in
the
arabesques
on
the
stones
how
charming
is
that
doorway
how
mysterious
the
vaulted
arcade
leading
to
the
stairs
who
could
fail
to
admire
the
steps
on
which
ingenious
art
has
laid
a
carpet
that
will
last
while
venice
stands
a
carpet
as
rich
as
if
wrought
in
turkey
but
composed
of
marbles
in
endless
variety
of
shapes
inlaid
in
white
marble
you
will
delight
in
the
charming
ornament
of
the
colonnades
of
the
upper
story
gilt
like
those
of
a
ducal
palace
so
that
the
marvels
of
art
are
both
under
your
feet
and
above
your
head
what
delicate
shadows
how
silent
how
cool
but
how
solemn
too
was
that
old
palace
where
to
delight
emilio
and
his
friend
vendramin
the
duchess
had
collected
antique
venetian
furniture
and
employed
skilled
hands
to
restore
the
ceilings
there
old
venice
lived
again
the
splendor
was
not
merely
noble
it
was
instructive
the
archaeologist
would
have
found
there
such
models
of
perfection
as
the
middle
ages
produced
having
taken
example
from
venice
here
were
to
be
seen
the
original
ceilings
of
woodwork
covered
with
scrolls
and
flowers
in
gold
on
a
colored
ground
or
in
colors
on
gold
and
ceilings
of
gilt
plaster
castings
with
a
picture
of
many
figures
in
each
corner
with
a
splendid
fresco
in
the
centre
a
style
so
costly
that
there
are
not
two
in
the
louvre
and
that
the
extravagance
of
louis
xiv
shrunk
from
such
expense
at
versailles
on
all
sides
marble
wood
and
silk
had
served
as
materials
for
exquisite
workmanship
emilio
pushed
open
a
carved
oak
door
made
his
way
down
the
long
vaulted
passage
which
runs
from
end
to
end
on
each
floor
of
a
venetian
palazzo
and
stopped
before
another
door
so
familiar
that
it
made
his
heart
beat
on
seeing
him
a
lady
companion
came
out
of
a
vast
and
admitted
him
to
a
study
where
he
found
the
duchess
on
her
knees
in
front
of
a
madonna
he
had
come
to
confess
and
ask
forgiveness
massimilla
in
prayer
had
converted
him
he
and
god
nothing
else
dwelt
in
that
heart
the
duchess
rose
very
unaffectedly
and
held
out
her
hand
her
lover
did
not
take
it
did
not
gianbattista
see
you
yesterday
she
asked
no
he
replied
that
piece
of
gave
me
a
night
of
misery
i
was
so
afraid
lest
you
might
meet
the
duke
whose
perversity
i
know
too
well
what
made
vendramin
let
your
palace
to
him
it
was
a
good
idea
milla
for
your
prince
is
poor
massimilla
was
so
beautiful
in
her
trust
of
him
and
so
wonderfully
lovely
so
happy
in
emilio
s
presence
that
at
this
moment
the
prince
wide
awake
experienced
the
sensations
of
the
horrible
dream
that
torments
persons
of
a
lively
imagination
in
which
after
arriving
in
a
ballroom
full
of
women
in
full
dress
the
dreamer
is
suddenly
aware
that
he
is
naked
without
even
a
shirt
shame
and
terror
possess
him
by
turns
and
only
waking
can
relieve
him
from
his
misery
thus
stood
emilio
s
soul
in
the
presence
of
his
mistress
hitherto
that
soul
had
known
only
the
fairest
flowers
of
feeling
a
debauch
had
plunged
it
into
dishonor
this
none
knew
but
he
for
the
beautiful
florentine
ascribed
so
many
virtues
to
her
lover
that
the
man
she
adored
could
not
but
be
incapable
of
any
stain
as
emilio
had
not
taken
her
hand
the
duchess
pushed
her
fingers
through
his
hair
that
the
singer
had
kissed
then
she
perceived
that
emilio
s
hand
was
clammy
and
his
brow
moist
what
ails
you
she
asked
in
a
voice
to
which
tenderness
gave
the
sweetness
of
a
flute
never
till
this
moment
have
i
known
how
much
i
love
you
he
replied
well
dear
idol
what
would
you
have
said
she
what
have
i
done
to
make
her
ask
that
he
wondered
to
himself
emilio
what
letter
was
that
which
you
threw
into
the
lagoon
vendramini
s
i
had
not
read
it
to
the
end
or
i
should
never
have
gone
to
my
palazzo
and
there
have
met
the
duke
for
no
doubt
it
told
me
all
about
massimilla
turned
pale
but
a
caress
from
emilio
reassured
her
stay
with
me
all
day
we
will
go
to
the
opera
together
we
will
not
set
out
for
friuli
your
presence
will
no
doubt
enable
me
to
endure
cataneo
s
said
massimilla
though
this
would
be
torment
to
her
lover
s
soul
he
consented
with
apparent
joy
if
anything
can
give
us
a
foretaste
of
what
the
damned
will
suffer
on
finding
themselves
so
unworthy
of
god
is
it
not
the
state
of
a
young
man
as
yet
unpolluted
in
the
presence
of
a
mistress
he
reveres
while
he
still
feels
on
his
lips
the
taste
of
infidelity
and
brings
into
the
sanctuary
of
the
divinity
he
worships
the
tainted
atmosphere
of
the
courtesan
baader
who
in
his
lectures
eliminated
things
divine
by
erotic
imagery
had
no
doubt
observed
like
some
catholic
writers
the
intimate
resemblance
between
human
and
heavenly
love
this
distress
of
mind
cast
a
hue
of
melancholy
over
the
pleasure
the
young
venetian
felt
in
his
mistress
presence
a
woman
s
instinct
has
amazing
aptitude
for
harmony
of
feeling
it
assumes
the
hue
it
vibrates
to
the
note
suggested
by
her
lover
the
pungent
flavor
of
coquettish
spice
is
far
indeed
from
spurring
affection
so
much
as
this
gentle
sympathy
of
tenderness
the
smartness
of
a
coquette
too
clearly
marks
opposition
however
transient
it
is
displeasing
but
this
intimate
comprehension
shows
a
perfect
fusion
of
souls
the
hapless
emilio
was
touched
by
the
unspoken
divination
which
led
the
duchess
to
pity
a
fault
unknown
to
her
massimilla
feeling
that
her
strength
lay
in
the
absence
of
any
sensual
side
to
her
love
could
allow
herself
to
be
expansive
she
boldly
and
confidently
poured
out
her
angelic
spirit
she
stripped
it
bare
just
as
during
that
diabolical
night
la
tinti
had
displayed
the
soft
lines
of
her
body
and
her
firm
elastic
flesh
in
emilio
s
eyes
there
was
as
it
were
a
conflict
between
the
saintly
love
of
this
white
soul
and
that
of
the
vehement
and
muscular
sicilian
the
day
was
spent
in
long
looks
following
on
deep
meditations
each
of
them
gauged
the
depths
of
tender
feeling
and
found
it
bottomless
a
conviction
that
brought
fond
words
to
their
lips
modesty
the
goddess
who
in
a
moment
of
forgetfulness
with
love
was
the
mother
of
coquettishness
need
not
have
put
her
hand
before
her
face
as
she
looked
at
these
lovers
as
a
crowning
joy
an
orgy
of
happiness
massimilla
pillowed
emilio
s
head
in
her
arms
and
now
and
then
ventured
to
press
her
lips
to
his
but
only
as
a
bird
dips
its
beak
into
the
clear
waters
of
a
spring
looking
round
lest
it
should
be
seen
their
fancy
worked
upon
this
kiss
as
a
composer
develops
a
subject
by
the
endless
resources
of
music
and
it
produced
in
them
such
tumultuous
and
vibrating
echoes
as
fevered
their
blood
the
idea
must
always
be
stronger
than
the
fact
otherwise
desire
would
be
less
perfect
than
satisfaction
and
it
is
in
fact
the
stronger
it
gives
birth
to
wit
and
indeed
they
were
perfectly
happy
for
enjoyment
must
always
take
something
off
happiness
married
in
heaven
alone
these
two
lovers
admired
each
other
in
their
purest
aspect
that
of
two
souls
incandescent
and
united
in
celestial
light
radiant
to
the
eyes
that
faith
has
touched
and
above
all
filled
with
the
rapture
which
the
brush
of
a
raphael
a
titian
a
murillo
has
depicted
and
which
those
who
have
ever
known
it
taste
again
as
they
gaze
at
those
paintings
do
not
such
peerless
spirits
scorn
the
coarser
joys
lavished
by
the
sicilian
singer
the
material
expression
of
that
angelic
union
these
noble
thoughts
were
in
the
prince
s
mind
as
he
reposed
in
heavenly
calm
on
massimilla
s
cool
soft
white
bosom
under
the
gentle
radiance
of
her
eyes
veiled
by
long
bright
lashes
and
he
gave
himself
up
to
this
dream
of
an
ideal
orgy
at
such
a
moment
massimilla
was
as
one
of
the
virgin
visions
seen
in
dreams
which
vanish
at
but
whom
we
recognize
when
we
find
them
again
in
their
realm
of
glory
in
the
works
of
some
great
painters
of
heaven
in
the
evening
the
lovers
went
to
the
theatre
this
is
the
way
of
italian
life
love
in
the
morning
music
in
the
evening
the
night
for
sleep
how
far
preferable
is
this
existence
to
that
of
a
country
where
every
one
expends
his
lungs
and
strength
in
politics
without
contributing
any
more
to
the
progress
of
affairs
than
a
grain
of
sand
can
make
a
cloud
of
dust
liberty
in
those
strange
lands
consists
in
the
right
to
squabble
over
public
concerns
to
take
care
of
oneself
to
waste
time
in
patriotic
undertakings
each
more
futile
than
the
last
inasmuch
as
they
all
weaken
that
noble
holy
which
is
the
parent
of
all
great
human
achievement
at
venice
on
the
contrary
love
and
its
myriad
ties
the
sweet
business
of
real
happiness
fills
up
all
the
time
in
that
country
love
is
so
much
a
matter
of
course
that
the
duchess
was
regarded
as
a
wonder
for
in
spite
of
her
violent
attachment
to
emilio
everybody
was
confident
of
her
immaculate
purity
and
women
gave
their
sincere
pity
to
the
poor
young
man
who
was
regarded
as
a
victim
to
the
virtue
of
his
at
the
same
time
no
one
cared
to
blame
the
duchess
for
in
italy
religion
is
a
power
as
much
respected
as
love
evening
after
evening
massimilla
s
box
was
the
first
object
of
every
and
each
woman
would
say
to
her
lover
as
she
studied
the
duchess
and
her
adorer
how
far
have
they
got
the
lover
would
examine
emilio
seeking
some
evidence
of
success
would
find
no
expression
but
that
of
a
pure
and
dejected
passion
and
throughout
the
house
as
they
visited
from
box
to
box
the
men
would
say
to
the
ladies
la
cataneo
is
not
yet
emilio
she
is
unwise
said
the
old
women
she
will
tire
him
perhaps
the
young
wives
would
reply
with
the
solemn
accent
that
italians
can
infuse
into
that
great
word
the
answer
to
many
questions
here
below
some
women
were
indignant
thought
the
whole
thing
and
declared
that
it
was
a
misapprehension
of
religion
to
allow
it
to
smother
love
my
dear
love
that
poor
emilio
said
the
signora
vulpato
to
massimilla
as
they
met
on
the
stairs
in
going
out
i
do
love
him
with
all
my
might
replied
the
duchess
then
why
does
not
he
look
happy
massimilla
s
reply
was
a
little
shrug
of
her
shoulders
we
in
france
france
as
the
growing
mania
for
english
proprieties
has
made
it
can
form
no
idea
of
the
serious
interest
taken
in
this
affair
by
venetian
society
vendramini
alone
knew
emilio
s
secret
which
was
carefully
kept
between
two
men
who
had
for
private
pleasure
combined
their
coats
of
arms
with
the
motto
amici
the
opening
night
of
the
opera
season
is
an
event
at
venice
as
in
every
capital
in
italy
the
was
crowded
the
five
hours
of
the
night
that
are
spent
at
the
theatre
fill
so
important
a
place
in
italian
life
that
it
is
well
to
give
an
account
of
the
customs
that
have
risen
from
this
manner
of
spending
time
the
boxes
in
italy
are
unlike
those
of
any
other
country
inasmuch
as
that
elsewhere
the
women
go
to
be
seen
and
that
italian
ladies
do
not
care
to
make
a
show
of
themselves
each
box
is
long
and
narrow
sloping
at
an
angle
to
the
front
and
to
the
passage
behind
on
each
side
is
a
sofa
and
at
the
end
stand
two
armchairs
one
for
the
mistress
of
the
box
and
the
other
for
a
lady
friend
when
she
brings
one
which
she
rarely
does
each
lady
is
in
fact
too
much
engaged
in
her
own
box
to
call
on
others
or
to
wish
to
see
them
also
no
one
cares
to
introduce
a
rival
an
italian
woman
almost
always
reigns
alone
in
her
box
the
mothers
are
not
the
slaves
of
their
daughters
the
daughters
have
no
mother
on
their
hands
thus
there
are
no
children
no
relations
to
watch
and
censure
and
bore
or
cut
into
a
conversation
in
front
every
box
is
draped
in
the
same
way
with
the
same
silk
from
the
cornice
hang
curtains
also
all
to
match
and
these
remain
drawn
when
the
family
to
whom
the
box
belongs
is
in
mourning
with
very
few
exceptions
and
those
only
at
milan
there
is
no
light
inside
the
box
they
are
illuminated
only
from
the
stage
and
from
a
not
very
brilliant
hanging
lustre
which
in
spite
of
protests
has
been
introduced
into
the
house
in
some
towns
still
screened
by
the
curtains
they
are
never
very
light
and
their
arrangement
leaves
the
back
of
the
box
so
dark
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
see
what
is
going
on
the
boxes
large
enough
to
accommodate
eight
or
ten
persons
are
decorated
with
handsome
silks
the
ceilings
are
painted
and
ornamented
in
light
and
pleasing
colors
the
woodwork
is
gilt
ices
and
sorbets
are
served
there
and
sweetmeats
for
only
the
plebeian
classes
ever
have
a
serious
meal
each
box
is
freehold
property
and
of
considerable
value
some
are
estimated
at
as
much
as
thirty
thousand
lire
the
litta
family
at
milan
own
three
adjoining
these
facts
sufficiently
indicate
the
importance
attributed
to
this
incident
of
fashionable
life
conversation
reigns
supreme
in
this
little
apartment
which
stendhal
one
of
the
most
ingenious
of
modern
writers
and
a
keen
student
of
italian
manners
has
called
a
boudoir
with
a
window
opening
on
to
a
pit
the
music
and
the
spectacle
are
in
fact
purely
accessory
the
real
interest
of
the
evening
is
in
the
social
meeting
there
the
trivialities
of
love
that
are
discussed
the
assignations
held
the
anecdotes
and
gossip
that
creep
in
the
theatre
is
an
inexpensive
for
a
whole
society
which
is
content
and
amused
with
studying
itself
the
men
who
are
admitted
take
their
seats
on
one
of
the
sofas
in
the
order
of
their
arrival
the
first
comer
naturally
is
next
to
the
mistress
of
the
box
but
when
both
seats
are
full
if
another
visitor
comes
in
the
one
who
has
sat
longest
rises
takes
his
leave
and
departs
all
move
up
one
place
and
so
each
in
turn
is
next
the
sovereign
this
futile
gossip
or
serious
colloquy
these
elegant
trivialities
of
italian
life
inevitably
imply
some
general
intimacy
the
lady
may
be
in
full
dress
or
not
as
she
pleases
she
is
so
completely
at
home
that
a
stranger
who
has
been
received
in
her
box
may
call
on
her
next
day
at
her
residence
the
foreign
visitor
can
not
at
first
understand
this
life
of
idle
wit
this
far
on
a
background
of
music
only
long
custom
and
keen
observation
can
ever
reveal
to
a
foreigner
the
meaning
of
italian
life
which
is
like
the
free
sky
of
the
south
and
where
a
rich
man
will
not
endure
a
cloud
a
man
of
rank
cares
little
about
the
management
of
his
fortune
he
leaves
the
details
to
his
stewards
ragionati
who
rob
and
ruin
him
he
has
no
instinct
for
politics
and
they
would
presently
bore
him
he
lives
exclusively
for
passion
which
fills
up
all
his
time
hence
the
necessity
felt
by
the
lady
and
her
lover
for
being
constantly
together
for
the
great
feature
of
such
a
life
is
the
lover
who
for
five
hours
is
kept
under
the
eye
of
a
woman
who
has
had
him
at
her
feet
all
day
thus
italian
habits
allow
of
perpetual
satisfaction
and
necessitate
a
constant
study
of
the
means
fitted
to
insure
it
though
hidden
under
apparent
it
is
a
beautiful
life
but
a
reckless
one
and
in
no
country
in
the
world
are
men
so
often
found
worn
out
the
duchess
box
was
on
the
pit
tier
as
it
is
called
in
venice
she
always
sat
where
the
light
from
the
stage
fell
on
her
face
so
that
her
handsome
head
softly
illuminated
stood
out
against
the
dark
background
the
florentine
attracted
every
gaze
by
her
broad
high
brow
as
white
as
snow
crowned
with
plaits
of
black
hair
that
gave
her
a
really
royal
look
by
the
refinement
of
her
features
resembling
the
noble
features
of
andrea
del
sarto
s
heads
by
the
outline
of
her
face
the
setting
of
her
eyes
and
by
those
velvet
eyes
themselves
which
spoke
of
the
rapture
of
a
woman
dreaming
of
happiness
still
pure
though
loving
at
once
attractive
and
dignified
instead
of
in
which
la
tinti
was
to
have
appeared
with
genovese
was
given
and
the
tenor
was
to
sing
without
the
celebrated
prima
donna
the
manager
announced
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
change
the
opera
in
consequence
of
la
tinti
s
being
ill
and
the
duke
was
not
to
be
seen
in
the
theatre
was
this
a
clever
trick
on
the
part
of
the
management
to
secure
two
full
houses
by
bringing
out
genovese
and
tinti
separately
or
was
clarina
s
indisposition
genuine
while
this
was
open
to
discussion
by
others
emilio
might
be
better
informed
and
though
the
announcement
caused
him
some
remorse
as
he
remembered
the
singer
s
beauty
and
vehemence
her
absence
and
the
duke
s
put
both
the
prince
and
the
duchess
very
much
at
their
ease
and
genovese
sang
in
such
a
way
as
to
drive
out
all
memories
of
a
night
of
illicit
love
and
to
prolong
the
heavenly
joys
of
this
blissful
day
happy
to
be
alone
to
receive
the
applause
of
the
house
the
tenor
did
his
best
with
the
powers
which
have
since
achieved
european
fame
genovese
then
but
born
at
bergamo
a
pupil
of
veluti
s
and
devoted
to
his
art
a
fine
man
clever
in
apprehending
the
spirit
of
a
part
was
already
developing
into
the
great
artist
destined
to
win
fame
and
fortune
he
had
a
wild
success
a
phrase
which
is
literally
exact
only
in
italy
where
the
applause
of
the
house
is
absolutely
frenzied
when
a
singer
procures
it
enjoyment
some
of
the
prince
s
friends
came
to
congratulate
him
on
coming
into
his
title
and
to
discuss
the
news
only
last
evening
la
tinti
taken
by
the
duke
to
the
vulpatos
had
sung
there
apparently
in
health
as
sound
as
her
voice
was
fine
hence
her
sudden
disposition
gave
rise
to
much
comment
it
was
rumored
at
the
cafe
florian
that
genovese
was
desperately
in
love
with
clarina
that
she
was
only
anxious
to
avoid
his
declarations
and
that
the
manager
had
tried
in
vain
to
induce
her
to
appear
with
him
the
austrian
general
on
the
other
hand
asserted
that
it
was
the
duke
who
was
ill
that
the
prima
donna
was
nursing
him
and
that
genovese
had
been
commanded
to
make
amends
to
the
public
the
duchess
owed
this
visit
from
the
austrian
general
to
the
fact
that
a
french
physician
had
come
to
venice
whom
the
general
wished
to
introduce
to
her
the
prince
seeing
vendramin
wandering
about
the
went
out
for
a
few
minutes
of
confidential
talk
with
his
friend
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
three
months
and
as
they
walked
round
the
gangway
which
divides
the
seats
in
the
pit
from
the
lowest
tier
of
boxes
he
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
massimilla
s
reception
of
the
foreigner
who
is
that
frenchman
asked
the
prince
a
physician
sent
for
by
cataneo
who
wants
to
know
how
long
he
is
likely
to
live
said
vendramin
the
frenchman
is
waiting
for
malfatti
with
whom
he
is
to
hold
a
like
every
italian
woman
who
is
in
love
the
duchess
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
emilio
for
in
that
land
a
woman
is
so
wholly
wrapped
up
in
her
lover
that
it
is
difficult
to
detect
an
expressive
glance
directed
at
anybody
else
caro
said
the
prince
to
his
friend
remember
i
slept
at
your
house
last
have
you
triumphed
said
vendramin
putting
his
arm
round
emilio
s
waist
no
but
i
hope
i
may
some
day
be
happy
with
well
replied
marco
then
you
will
be
the
most
envied
man
on
earth
the
duchess
is
the
most
perfect
woman
in
italy
to
me
seeing
things
as
i
do
through
the
dazzling
medium
of
opium
she
seems
the
very
highest
expression
of
art
for
nature
without
knowing
it
has
made
her
a
raphael
picture
your
passion
gives
no
umbrage
to
cataneo
who
has
handed
over
to
me
a
thousand
crowns
which
i
am
to
give
to
well
added
emilio
whatever
you
may
hear
said
i
sleep
every
night
at
your
house
come
for
every
minute
spent
away
from
her
when
i
might
be
with
her
is
emilio
took
his
seat
at
the
back
of
the
box
and
remained
there
in
silence
listening
to
the
duchess
enchanted
by
her
wit
and
beauty
it
was
for
him
and
not
out
of
vanity
that
massimilla
lavished
the
charms
of
her
conversation
bright
with
italian
wit
in
which
sarcasm
lashed
things
but
not
persons
laughter
attacked
nothing
that
was
not
laughable
mere
trifles
were
seasoned
with
attic
salt
anywhere
else
she
might
have
been
tiresome
the
italians
an
eminently
intelligent
race
have
no
fancy
for
displaying
their
talents
where
they
are
not
in
demand
their
chat
is
perfectly
simple
and
effortless
it
never
makes
play
as
in
france
under
the
lead
of
a
fencing
master
each
one
flourishing
his
foil
or
if
he
has
nothing
to
say
sitting
humiliated
conversation
sparkles
with
a
delicate
and
subtle
satire
that
plays
gracefully
with
familiar
facts
and
instead
of
a
compromising
epigram
an
italian
has
a
glance
or
a
smile
of
unutterable
meaning
they
think
and
they
are
right
that
to
be
expected
to
understand
ideas
when
they
only
seek
enjoyment
is
a
bore
indeed
la
vulpato
had
said
to
massimilla
if
you
loved
him
you
would
not
talk
so
emilio
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
he
listened
and
gazed
this
reserve
might
have
led
foreigners
to
suppose
that
the
prince
was
a
man
of
no
intelligence
their
impression
very
commonly
of
an
italian
in
love
whereas
he
was
simply
a
lover
up
to
his
ears
in
rapture
vendramin
sat
down
by
emilio
opposite
the
frenchman
who
as
the
stranger
occupied
the
corner
facing
the
duchess
is
that
gentleman
drunk
said
the
physician
in
an
undertone
to
massimilla
after
looking
at
vendramin
yes
replied
she
simply
in
that
land
of
passion
each
passion
bears
its
excuse
in
itself
and
gracious
indulgence
is
shown
to
every
form
of
error
the
duchess
sighed
deeply
and
an
expression
of
suppressed
pain
passed
over
her
features
you
will
see
strange
things
in
our
country
monsieur
she
went
on
vendramin
lives
on
opium
as
this
one
lives
on
love
and
that
one
buries
himself
in
learning
most
young
men
have
a
passion
for
a
dancer
as
older
men
are
miserly
we
all
create
some
happiness
or
some
madness
for
because
you
all
want
to
divert
your
minds
from
some
fixed
idea
for
which
a
revolution
would
be
a
radical
cure
replied
the
physician
the
genoese
regrets
his
republic
the
milanese
pines
for
his
independence
the
piemontese
longs
for
a
constitutional
government
the
romagna
cries
for
liberty
of
which
it
knows
nothing
interrupted
the
duchess
alas
there
are
men
in
italy
so
stupid
as
to
long
for
your
idiotic
charter
which
destroys
the
influence
of
woman
most
of
my
must
need
read
your
french
books
useless
rhodomontade
useless
cried
the
frenchman
why
monsieur
the
duchess
went
on
what
can
you
find
in
a
book
that
is
better
than
what
we
have
in
our
hearts
italy
is
i
can
not
see
that
a
people
is
mad
because
it
wishes
to
be
its
own
master
said
the
physician
good
heavens
exclaimed
the
duchess
eagerly
does
not
that
mean
paying
with
a
great
deal
of
bloodshed
for
the
right
of
quarreling
as
you
do
over
crazy
ideas
then
you
approve
of
despotism
said
the
physician
why
should
i
not
approve
of
a
system
of
government
which
by
depriving
us
of
books
and
odious
politics
leaves
men
entirely
to
us
i
had
thought
that
the
italians
were
more
patriotic
said
the
frenchman
massimilla
laughed
so
slyly
that
her
interlocutor
could
not
distinguish
mockery
from
serious
meaning
nor
her
real
opinion
from
ironical
criticism
then
you
are
not
a
liberal
said
he
heaven
preserve
me
said
she
i
can
imagine
nothing
in
worse
taste
than
such
opinions
in
a
woman
could
you
love
a
woman
whose
heart
was
occupied
by
all
mankind
those
who
love
are
naturally
aristocrats
the
austrian
general
observed
with
a
smile
as
i
came
into
the
theatre
the
frenchman
observed
you
were
the
first
person
i
saw
and
i
remarked
to
his
excellency
that
if
there
was
a
woman
who
could
personify
a
nation
it
was
you
but
i
grieve
to
discover
that
though
you
represent
its
divine
beauty
you
have
not
the
constitutional
are
you
not
bound
said
the
duchess
pointing
to
the
ballet
now
being
danced
to
find
all
our
dancers
detestable
and
our
singers
atrocious
paris
and
london
rob
us
of
all
our
leading
stars
paris
passes
judgment
on
them
and
london
pays
them
genovese
and
la
tinti
will
not
be
left
to
us
for
six
months
at
this
juncture
the
austrian
left
the
box
vendramin
the
prince
and
the
other
two
italians
exchanged
a
look
and
a
smile
glancing
at
the
french
physician
he
for
a
moment
felt
doubtful
of
himself
a
rare
thing
in
a
frenchman
fancying
he
had
said
or
done
something
incongruous
but
the
riddle
was
immediately
solved
do
you
thing
it
would
be
judicious
said
emilio
if
we
spoke
our
mind
in
the
presence
of
our
masters
you
are
in
a
land
of
slaves
said
the
duchess
in
a
tone
and
with
a
droop
of
the
head
which
gave
her
at
once
the
look
for
which
the
physician
had
sought
in
vain
vendramin
she
went
on
speaking
so
that
only
the
stranger
could
hear
her
took
to
smoking
opium
a
villainous
idea
suggested
to
him
by
an
englishman
who
for
other
reasons
of
his
craved
an
easy
death
not
death
as
men
see
it
in
the
form
of
a
skeleton
but
death
draped
with
the
frippery
you
in
france
call
a
flag
a
maiden
form
crowned
with
flowers
or
laurels
she
appears
in
a
cloud
of
gunpowder
borne
on
the
flight
of
a
or
else
stretched
on
a
bed
between
two
courtesans
or
again
she
rises
in
the
steam
of
a
bowl
of
punch
or
the
dazzling
vapor
of
a
diamond
but
a
diamond
in
the
form
of
carbon
whenever
vendramin
chooses
for
three
austrian
lire
he
can
be
a
venetian
captain
he
can
sail
in
the
galleys
of
the
republic
and
conquer
the
gilded
domes
of
constantinople
then
he
can
lounge
on
the
divans
in
the
seraglio
among
the
sultan
s
wives
while
the
grand
signor
himself
is
the
slave
of
the
venetian
conqueror
he
returns
to
restore
his
palazzo
with
the
spoils
of
the
ottoman
empire
he
can
quit
the
women
of
the
east
for
the
doubly
masked
intrigues
of
his
beloved
venetians
and
fancy
that
he
dreads
the
jealousy
which
has
ceased
to
exist
for
three
zwanziger
he
can
transport
himself
into
the
council
of
ten
can
wield
there
terrible
power
and
leave
the
doges
palace
to
sleep
under
the
watch
of
a
pair
of
flashing
eyes
or
to
climb
a
balcony
from
which
a
fair
hand
has
hung
a
silken
ladder
he
can
love
a
woman
to
whom
opium
lends
such
poetic
grace
as
we
women
of
flesh
and
blood
could
never
show
presently
he
turns
over
and
he
is
face
to
face
with
the
dreadful
frown
of
the
senator
who
holds
a
dagger
he
hears
the
blade
plunged
into
his
mistress
heart
she
dies
smiling
on
him
for
she
has
saved
him
and
she
is
a
happy
woman
added
the
duchess
looking
at
emilio
he
escapes
and
flies
to
command
the
dalmatians
to
conquer
the
illyrian
coast
for
his
beloved
venice
his
glory
wins
him
forgiveness
and
he
enjoys
a
life
of
domestic
happiness
a
home
a
winter
evening
a
young
wife
and
charming
children
who
pray
to
san
marco
under
the
care
of
an
old
nurse
yes
for
three
francs
worth
of
opium
he
furnishes
our
empty
arsenal
he
watches
convoys
of
merchandise
coming
in
going
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
world
the
forces
of
modern
industry
no
longer
reign
in
london
but
in
his
own
venice
where
the
hanging
gardens
of
semiramis
the
temple
of
jerusalem
the
marvels
of
rome
live
once
more
he
adds
to
the
glories
of
the
middle
ages
by
the
labors
of
steam
by
new
masterpieces
of
art
under
the
protection
of
venice
who
protected
it
of
old
monuments
and
nations
crowd
into
his
little
brain
there
is
room
for
them
all
empires
and
cities
and
revolutions
come
and
vanish
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
while
venice
alone
expands
and
lives
for
the
venice
of
his
dreams
is
the
empress
of
the
seas
she
has
two
millions
of
inhabitants
the
sceptre
of
italy
the
mastery
of
the
mediterranean
and
the
indies
what
an
opera
is
the
brain
of
man
what
an
unfathomed
abyss
even
to
those
who
like
gall
have
mapped
it
out
cried
the
physician
dear
duchess
said
vendramin
do
not
omit
the
last
service
that
my
elixir
will
do
me
after
hearing
ravishing
voices
and
imbibing
music
through
every
pore
after
experiencing
the
keenest
pleasures
and
the
fiercest
delights
of
mahomet
s
paradise
i
see
none
but
the
most
terrible
images
i
have
visions
of
my
beloved
venice
full
of
children
s
faces
distorted
like
those
of
the
dying
of
women
covered
with
dreadful
wounds
torn
and
wailing
of
men
mangled
and
crushed
by
the
copper
sides
of
crashing
vessels
i
begin
to
see
venice
as
she
is
shrouded
in
crape
stripped
robbed
destitute
pale
phantoms
wander
through
her
streets
already
the
austrian
soldiers
are
grinning
over
me
already
my
visionary
life
is
drifting
into
real
life
whereas
six
months
ago
real
life
was
the
bad
dream
and
the
life
of
opium
held
love
and
bliss
important
affairs
and
political
interests
alas
to
my
grief
i
see
the
dawn
over
my
tomb
where
truth
and
falsehood
mingle
in
a
dubious
light
which
is
neither
day
nor
darkness
but
partakes
of
so
you
see
that
in
this
head
there
is
too
much
patriotism
said
the
prince
laying
his
hand
on
the
thick
black
curls
that
fell
on
vendramin
s
brow
oh
if
he
loves
us
he
will
give
up
his
dreadful
opium
said
massimilla
i
will
cure
your
friend
said
the
frenchman
achieve
that
and
we
shall
love
you
said
the
duchess
but
if
on
your
return
to
france
you
do
not
calumniate
us
we
shall
love
you
even
better
the
hapless
italians
are
too
much
crushed
by
foreign
dominion
to
be
fairly
judged
for
we
have
known
yours
she
added
with
a
smile
it
was
more
generous
than
austria
s
said
the
physician
eagerly
austria
squeezes
and
gives
us
nothing
back
and
you
squeeze
to
enlarge
and
beautify
our
towns
you
stimulated
us
by
giving
us
an
army
you
thought
you
could
keep
italy
and
they
expect
to
lose
it
there
lies
the
difference
the
austrians
provide
us
with
a
sort
of
ease
that
is
as
stultifying
and
heavy
as
themselves
while
you
overwhelmed
us
by
your
devouring
energy
but
whether
we
die
of
tonics
or
of
narcotics
what
does
it
matter
it
is
death
all
the
same
monsieur
le
unhappy
italy
in
my
eyes
she
is
like
a
beautiful
woman
whom
france
ought
to
protect
by
making
her
his
mistress
exclaimed
the
frenchman
but
you
could
not
love
us
as
we
wish
to
be
loved
said
the
duchess
smiling
we
want
to
be
free
but
the
liberty
i
crave
is
not
your
ignoble
and
liberalism
which
would
kill
all
art
i
ask
said
she
in
a
tone
that
thrilled
through
the
box
that
is
to
say
i
would
ask
that
each
italian
republic
should
be
resuscitated
with
its
nobles
its
citizens
its
special
privileges
for
each
caste
i
would
have
the
old
aristocratic
republics
once
more
with
their
intestine
warfare
and
rivalry
that
gave
birth
to
the
noblest
works
of
art
that
created
politics
that
raised
up
the
great
princely
houses
by
extending
the
action
of
one
government
over
a
vast
expanse
of
country
it
is
frittered
down
the
italian
republics
were
the
glory
of
europe
in
the
middle
ages
why
has
italy
succumbed
when
the
swiss
who
were
her
porters
have
triumphed
the
swiss
republics
said
the
doctor
were
worthy
housewives
busy
with
their
own
little
concerns
and
neither
having
any
cause
for
envying
another
your
republics
were
haughty
queens
preferring
to
sell
themselves
rather
than
bow
to
a
neighbor
they
fell
too
low
ever
to
rise
again
the
guelphs
are
do
not
pity
us
too
much
said
the
duchess
in
a
voice
that
made
the
two
friends
start
we
are
still
supreme
even
in
the
depths
of
her
misfortune
italy
governs
through
the
choicer
spirits
that
abound
in
her
cities
unfortunately
the
greater
number
of
her
geniuses
learn
to
understand
life
so
quickly
that
they
lie
sunk
in
pleasure
as
for
those
who
are
willing
to
play
the
melancholy
game
for
immortality
they
know
how
to
get
at
your
gold
and
to
secure
your
praises
ay
in
this
land
pitied
for
its
fallen
state
by
traveled
simpletons
and
hypocritical
poets
while
its
character
is
traduced
by
politicians
in
this
land
which
appears
so
languid
powerless
and
ruinous
worn
out
rather
than
old
there
are
puissant
brains
in
every
branch
of
life
genius
throwing
out
vigorous
shoots
as
an
old
throws
out
canes
productive
of
delicious

you
will
find
in
capraja
one
of
our
cleverest
men
but
in
love
with
obscurity
no
one
but
the
duke
my
master
understands
music
so
thoroughly
as
he
does
indeed
he
is
known
here
as
after
sitting
a
few
minutes
listening
to
the
eager
war
of
words
between
the
physician
and
the
duchess
who
showed
much
ingenious
eloquence
the
italians
one
by
one
took
leave
and
went
off
to
tell
the
news
in
every
box
that
la
cataneo
who
was
regarded
as
a
woman
of
great
wit
and
spirit
had
on
the
question
of
italy
defeated
a
famous
french
doctor
this
was
the
talk
of
the
evening
as
soon
as
the
frenchman
found
himself
alone
with
the
duchess
and
the
prince
he
understood
that
they
were
to
be
left
together
and
took
leave
massimilla
bowed
with
a
bend
of
the
neck
that
placed
him
at
such
a
distance
that
this
salute
might
have
secured
her
the
man
s
hatred
if
he
could
have
ignored
the
charm
of
her
eloquence
and
beauty
thus
at
the
end
of
the
opera
emilio
and
massimilla
were
alone
and
holding
hands
they
listened
together
to
the
duet
that
finishes
there
is
nothing
but
music
to
express
love
said
the
duchess
moved
by
that
song
as
of
two
rapturous
nightingales
a
tear
twinkled
in
emilio
s
eye
massimilla
sublime
in
such
beauty
as
beams
in
raphael
s
pressed
his
hand
their
knees
touched
there
was
as
it
seemed
the
blossom
of
a
kiss
on
her
lips
the
prince
saw
on
her
blushing
face
a
glow
of
joy
like
that
which
on
a
summer
s
day
shines
down
on
the
golden
harvest
his
heart
seemed
bursting
with
the
tide
of
blood
that
rushed
to
it
he
fancied
that
he
could
hear
an
angelic
chorus
of
voices
and
he
would
have
given
his
life
to
feel
the
fire
of
passion
which
at
this
hour
last
night
had
filled
him
for
the
odious
clarina
but
he
was
at
the
moment
hardly
conscious
of
having
a
body
massimilla
much
distressed
ascribed
this
tear
in
her
guilelessness
to
the
remark
she
had
made
as
to
genovese
s
cavatina
but
said
she
in
emilio
s
ear
are
not
you
as
far
better
than
every
expression
of
love
as
cause
is
superior
to
effect
after
handing
the
duchess
to
her
gondola
emilio
waited
for
vendramin
to
go
to
florian
s
the
cafe
florian
at
venice
is
a
quite
undefinable
institution
merchants
transact
their
business
there
and
lawyers
meet
to
talk
over
their
most
difficult
cases
florian
s
is
at
once
an
exchange
a
a
newspaper
office
a
club
a
confessional
and
it
is
so
well
adapted
to
the
needs
of
the
place
that
some
venetian
women
never
know
what
their
husband
s
business
may
be
for
if
they
have
a
letter
to
write
they
go
to
write
it
there
spies
of
course
abound
at
florian
s
but
their
presence
only
sharpens
venetian
wits
which
may
here
exercise
the
discretion
once
so
famous
a
great
many
persons
spend
the
whole
day
at
florian
s
in
fact
to
some
men
florian
s
is
so
much
a
matter
of
necessity
that
between
the
acts
of
an
opera
they
leave
the
ladies
in
their
boxes
and
take
a
turn
to
hear
what
is
going
on
there
while
the
two
friends
were
walking
in
the
narrow
streets
of
the
merceria
they
did
not
speak
for
there
were
too
many
people
but
as
they
turned
into
the
piazzi
di
san
marco
the
prince
said
do
not
go
at
once
to
the
cafe
let
us
walk
about
i
want
to
talk
to
he
related
his
adventure
with
clarina
and
explained
his
position
to
vendramin
emilio
s
despair
seemed
so
nearly
allied
to
madness
that
he
promised
to
cure
him
completely
if
only
he
would
give
him
to
deal
with
massimilla
this
ray
of
hope
came
just
in
time
to
save
emilio
from
drowning
himself
that
night
for
indeed
as
he
remembered
the
singer
he
felt
a
horrible
wish
to
go
back
to
her
the
two
friends
then
went
to
an
inner
room
at
florian
s
where
they
listened
to
the
conversation
of
some
of
the
superior
men
of
the
town
who
discoursed
the
subjects
of
the
day
the
most
interesting
of
these
were
in
the
first
place
the
eccentricities
of
lord
byron
of
whom
the
venetians
made
great
sport
then
cataneo
s
attachment
for
la
tinti
for
which
no
reason
could
be
assigned
after
twenty
different
causes
had
been
suggested
then
genovese
s
debut
finally
the
tilting
match
between
the
duchess
and
the
french
doctor
just
as
the
discussion
became
vehemently
musical
duke
cataneo
made
his
appearance
he
bowed
very
courteously
to
emilio
which
seemed
so
natural
that
no
one
noticed
it
and
emilio
bowed
gravely
in
return
cataneo
looked
round
to
see
if
there
was
anybody
he
knew
recognized
vendramin
and
greeted
him
bowed
to
his
banker
a
rich
patrician
and
finally
to
the
man
who
happened
to
be
speaking
a
celebrated
musical
fanatic
a
friend
of
the
comtesse
albrizzi
like
some
others
who
frequented
florian
s
his
mode
of
life
was
absolutely
unknown
so
carefully
did
he
conceal
it
nothing
was
known
about
him
but
what
he
chose
to
tell
this
was
capraja
the
nobleman
whom
the
duchess
had
mentioned
to
the
french
doctor
this
venetian
was
one
of
a
class
of
dreamers
whose
powerful
minds
divine
everything
he
was
an
eccentric
theorist
and
cared
no
more
for
celebrity
than
for
a
broken
pipe
his
life
was
in
accordance
with
his
ideas
capraja
made
his
appearance
at
about
ten
every
morning
under
the
without
anyone
knowing
whence
he
came
he
lounged
about
venice
smoking
cigars
he
regularly
went
to
the
fenice
sitting
in
the
and
between
the
acts
went
round
to
florian
s
where
he
took
three
or
four
cups
of
coffee
a
day
and
he
ended
the
evening
at
the
cafe
never
leaving
it
till
about
two
in
the
morning
twelve
hundred
francs
a
year
paid
all
his
expenses
he
ate
but
one
meal
a
day
at
an
in
the
merceria
where
the
cook
had
his
dinner
ready
for
him
at
a
fixed
hour
on
a
little
table
at
the
back
of
the
shop
the
s
daughter
herself
prepared
his
stuffed
oysters
provided
him
with
cigars
and
took
care
of
his
money
by
his
advice
this
girl
though
she
was
very
handsome
would
never
countenance
a
lover
lived
very
steadily
and
still
wore
the
old
venetian
costume
this
venetian
girl
was
twelve
years
old
when
capraja
first
took
an
interest
in
her
and
when
he
died
she
was
very
fond
of
him
though
he
had
never
even
kissed
her
hand
or
her
brow
and
she
knew
nothing
whatever
of
the
poor
old
nobleman
s
intentions
with
regard
to
her
the
girl
had
at
last
as
complete
control
of
the
old
gentleman
as
a
mother
has
of
her
child
she
would
tell
him
when
he
wanted
clean
linen
next
day
he
would
come
without
a
shirt
and
she
would
give
him
a
clean
one
to
put
on
in
the
morning
he
never
looked
at
a
woman
either
in
the
theatre
or
out
walking
though
he
was
the
descendant
of
an
old
patrician
family
he
never
thought
his
rank
worth
mentioning
but
at
night
after
twelve
he
awoke
from
his
apathy
talked
and
showed
that
he
had
seen
and
heard
everything
this
peaceful
diogenes
quite
incapable
of
explaining
his
tenets
half
a
turk
half
a
venetian
was
short
and
fat
he
had
a
doge
s
sharp
nose
an
inquisitive
satirical
eye
and
a
discreet
though
smiling
mouth
when
he
died
it
became
known
that
he
had
lived
in
a
little
den
near
san
benedetto
he
had
two
million
francs
invested
in
the
funds
of
various
countries
of
europe
and
had
left
the
interest
untouched
ever
since
he
had
first
bought
the
securities
in
so
the
sum
was
now
enormous
alike
from
the
increased
value
of
the
capital
and
the
accumulated
interest
all
this
money
was
left
to
the
s
daughter
genovese
he
was
saying
will
do
wonders
whether
he
really
understands
the
great
end
of
music
or
acts
only
on
instinct
i
know
not
but
he
is
the
first
singer
who
ever
satisfied
me
i
shall
not
die
without
hearing
a
executed
as
i
have
heard
them
in
my
dreams
waking
with
a
feeling
as
though
the
sounds
were
floating
in
the
air
the
clear
is
the
highest
achievement
of
art
it
is
the
arabesque
decorating
the
finest
room
in
the
house
a
shade
too
little
and
it
is
nothing
a
touch
too
much
and
all
is
confusion
its
task
is
to
awake
in
the
soul
a
thousand
dormant
ideas
it
flies
up
and
sweeps
through
space
scattering
seeds
in
the
air
to
be
taken
in
by
our
ears
and
blossom
in
our
heart
believe
me
in
painting
his
raphael
gave
the
preference
to
music
over
poetry
and
he
was
right
music
appeals
to
the
heart
whereas
writing
is
addressed
to
the
intellect
it
communicates
ideas
directly
like
a
perfume
the
singer
s
voice
impinges
not
on
the
mind
not
on
the
memory
of
happiness
but
on
the
first
principle
of
thought
it
stirs
the
elements
of
sensation
it
is
a
grievous
thing
that
the
populace
should
have
compelled
musicians
to
adapt
their
expression
to
words
to
factitious
emotions
but
then
they
were
not
otherwise
intelligible
to
the
vulgar
thus
the
is
the
only
thing
left
to
the
lovers
of
pure
music
the
devotees
of
unfettered
art
as
i
listened
to
that
last
i
felt
as
if
i
were
beckoned
by
a
fair
creature
whose
look
alone
had
made
me
young
again
the
enchantress
placed
a
crown
on
my
brow
and
led
me
to
the
ivory
door
through
which
we
pass
to
the
mysterious
land
of
i
owe
it
to
genovese
that
i
escaped
for
a
few
minutes
from
this
old
husk
minutes
short
no
doubt
by
the
clock
but
very
long
by
the
record
of
sensation
for
a
brief
scented
with
roses
i
was
young
again
and
beloved
but
you
are
mistaken
capraja
said
the
duke
there
is
in
music
an
effect
yet
more
magical
than
that
of
the
what
is
that
asked
capraja
the
unison
of
two
voices
or
of
a
voice
and
a
violin
the
instrument
which
has
tones
most
nearly
resembling
those
of
the
human
voice
replied
cataneo
this
perfect
concord
bears
us
on
to
the
very
heart
of
life
on
the
tide
of
elements
which
can
resuscitate
rapture
and
carry
man
up
to
the
centre
of
the
luminous
sphere
where
his
mind
can
command
the
whole
universe
you
still
need
a
capraja
but
the
pure
element
is
enough
for
me
you
need
that
the
current
should
flow
through
the
myriad
canals
of
the
machine
to
fall
in
dazzling
cascades
while
i
am
content
with
the
pure
tranquil
pool
my
eye
gazes
across
a
lake
without
a
ripple
i
can
embrace
the
speak
no
more
cataneo
said
capraja
haughtily
what
do
you
fail
to
see
the
fairy
who
in
her
swift
rush
through
the
sparkling
atmosphere
collects
and
binds
with
the
golden
thread
of
harmony
the
gems
of
melody
she
smilingly
sheds
on
us
have
you
ever
felt
the
touch
of
her
wand
as
she
says
to
curiosity
awake
the
divinity
rises
up
radiant
from
the
depths
of
the
brain
she
flies
to
her
store
of
wonders
and
fingers
them
lightly
as
an
organist
touches
the
keys
suddenly
up
starts
memory
bringing
us
the
roses
of
the
past
divinely
preserved
and
still
fresh
the
mistress
of
our
youth
revives
and
strokes
the
young
man
s
hair
our
heart
too
full
overflows
we
see
the
flowery
banks
of
the
torrent
of
love
every
burning
bush
we
ever
knew
blazes
afresh
and
repeats
the
heavenly
words
we
once
heard
and
understood
the
voice
rolls
on
it
embraces
in
its
rapid
turns
those
fugitive
horizons
and
they
shrink
away
they
vanish
eclipsed
by
newer
and
deeper
joys
those
of
an
unrevealed
future
to
which
the
fairy
points
as
she
returns
to
the
blue
and
you
retorted
cataneo
have
you
never
seen
the
direct
ray
of
a
star
opening
the
vistas
above
have
you
never
mounted
on
that
beam
which
guides
you
to
the
sky
to
the
heart
of
the
first
causes
which
move
the
worlds
to
their
hearers
the
duke
and
capraja
were
playing
a
game
of
which
the
premises
were
unknown
genovese
s
voice
thrills
through
every
fibre
said
capraja
and
la
tinti
s
fires
the
blood
replied
the
duke
what
a
paraphrase
of
happy
love
is
that
capraja
went
on
ah
rossini
was
young
when
he
wrote
that
interpretation
of
effervescent
ecstasy
my
heart
filled
with
renewed
blood
a
thousand
cravings
tingled
in
my
veins
never
have
sounds
more
angelic
delivered
me
more
completely
from
my
earthly
bonds
never
did
the
fairy
wave
more
beautiful
arms
smile
more
invitingly
lift
her
tunic
more
cunningly
to
display
an
ankle
raising
the
curtain
that
hides
my
other
life
my
old
friend
replied
cataneo
you
shall
ride
on
the
back
of
a
dazzling
white
swan
who
will
show
you
the
loveliest
land
there
is
you
shall
see
the
as
children
see
it
your
heart
shall
open
to
the
radiance
of
a
new
sun
you
shall
sleep
on
crimson
silk
under
the
gaze
of
a
madonna
you
shall
feel
like
a
happy
lover
gently
kissed
by
a
nymph
whose
bare
feet
you
still
may
see
but
who
is
about
to
vanish
that
swan
will
be
the
voice
of
genovese
if
he
can
unite
it
to
its
leda
the
voice
of
clarina
night
we
are
to
hear
the
grandest
opera
produced
by
italy
s
greatest
all
present
left
the
conversation
to
the
duke
and
capraja
not
wishing
to
be
the
victims
of
mystification
only
vendramin
and
the
french
doctor
listened
to
them
for
a
few
minutes
the
understood
these
poetic
flights
he
had
the
key
of
the
palace
where
those
two
sensuous
imaginations
were
wandering
the
doctor
too
tried
to
understand
and
he
understood
for
he
was
one
of
the
pleiades
of
genius
belonging
to
the
paris
school
of
medicine
from
which
a
true
physician
comes
out
as
much
a
metaphysician
as
an
accomplished
analyst
do
you
understand
them
said
emilio
to
vendramin
as
they
left
the
cafe
at
two
in
the
morning
yes
my
dear
boy
said
vendramin
taking
emilio
home
with
him
those
two
men
are
of
the
legion
of
unearthly
spirits
to
whom
it
is
given
here
below
to
escape
from
the
wrappings
of
the
flesh
who
can
fly
on
the
shoulders
of
the
queen
of
witchcraft
up
to
the
blue
empyrean
where
the
sublime
marvels
are
wrought
of
the
intellectual
life
they
by
the
power
of
art
can
soar
whither
your
immense
love
carries
you
whither
opium
transports
me
then
none
can
understand
them
but
those
who
are
like
them
i
who
can
inspire
my
soul
by
such
base
means
who
can
pack
a
hundred
years
of
life
into
a
single
night
i
can
understand
those
lofty
spirits
when
they
talk
of
that
glorious
land
deemed
a
realm
of
chimeras
by
some
who
think
themselves
wise
but
the
realm
of
reality
to
us
whom
they
think
mad
well
the
duke
and
capraja
who
were
acquainted
at
naples
where
cataneo
was
born
are
mad
about
but
what
is
that
strange
system
that
capraja
was
eager
to
explain
to
the
duke
did
you
understand
yes
replied
vendramin
capraja
s
great
friend
is
a
musician
from
cremona
lodging
in
the
capello
palace
who
has
a
theory
that
sounds
meet
with
an
element
in
man
analogous
to
that
which
produces
ideas
according
to
him
man
has
within
him
keys
acted
on
by
sound
and
corresponding
to
his
where
ideas
and
sensations
take
their
rise
capraja
who
regards
the
arts
as
an
assemblage
of
means
by
which
he
can
harmonize
in
himself
all
external
nature
with
another
mysterious
nature
that
he
calls
the
inner
life
shares
all
ideas
of
this
who
at
this
moment
is
composing
an
opera
conceive
of
a
sublime
creation
wherein
the
marvels
of
the
visible
universe
are
reproduced
with
immeasurable
grandeur
lightness
swiftness
and
extension
wherein
sensation
is
infinite
and
whither
certain
privileged
natures
possessed
of
divine
powers
are
able
to
penetrate
and
you
will
have
some
notion
of
the
ecstatic
joys
of
which
cataneo
and
capraja
were
speaking
both
poets
each
for
himself
alone
only
in
matters
of
the
intellect
as
soon
as
a
man
can
rise
above
the
sphere
where
plastic
art
is
produced
by
a
process
of
imitation
and
enter
into
that
transcendental
sphere
of
abstractions
where
everything
is
understood
as
an
elementary
principle
and
seen
in
the
omnipotence
of
results
that
man
is
no
longer
intelligible
to
ordinary
you
have
thus
explained
my
love
for
massimilla
said
emilio
there
is
in
me
my
friend
a
force
which
awakes
under
the
fire
of
her
look
at
her
lightest
touch
and
wafts
me
to
a
world
of
light
where
effects
are
produced
of
which
i
dare
not
speak
it
has
seemed
to
me
often
that
the
delicate
tissue
of
her
skin
has
stamped
flowers
on
mine
as
her
hand
lies
on
my
hand
her
words
play
on
those
inner
keys
in
me
of
which
you
spoke
desire
excites
my
brain
stirring
that
invisible
world
instead
of
exciting
my
passive
flesh
the
air
seems
red
and
sparkling
unknown
perfumes
of
indescribable
strength
relax
my
sinews
roses
wreathe
my
temples
and
i
feel
as
though
my
blood
were
escaping
through
opened
arteries
so
complete
is
my
that
is
the
effect
on
me
of
smoking
opium
replied
vendramin
then
do
you
wish
to
die
cried
emilio
in
alarm
with
venice
said
vendramin
waving
his
hand
in
the
direction
of
san
marco
can
you
see
a
single
pinnacle
or
spire
that
stands
straight
do
you
not
perceive
that
the
sea
is
claiming
its
prey
the
prince
bent
his
head
he
dared
no
more
speak
to
his
friend
of
love
to
know
what
a
free
country
means
you
must
have
traveled
in
a
conquered
land
when
they
reached
the
palazzo
vendramin
they
saw
a
gondola
moored
at
the
the
prince
put
his
arm
round
vendramin
and
clasped
him
affectionately
saying
to
you
my
dear
fellow
what
a
woman
for
me
whose
only
love
is
venice
exclaimed
marco
at
this
instant
the
gondolier
who
was
leaning
against
a
column
recognizing
the
man
he
was
to
look
out
for
murmured
in
emilio
s
ear
the
duchess
emilio
sprang
into
the
gondola
where
he
was
seized
in
a
pair
of
soft
arms
an
embrace
of
iron
and
dragged
down
on
to
the
cushions
where
he
felt
the
heaving
bosom
of
an
ardent
woman
and
then
he
was
no
more
emilio
but
clarina
s
lover
for
his
ideas
and
feelings
were
so
bewildering
that
he
yielded
as
if
stupefied
by
her
first
kiss
forgive
this
trick
my
beloved
said
the
sicilian
i
shall
die
if
you
do
not
come
with
and
the
gondola
flew
over
the
secret
water
at
seven
on
the
following
evening
the
spectators
were
again
in
their
places
in
the
theatre
excepting
that
those
in
the
pit
always
took
their
chances
of
where
they
might
sit
old
capraja
was
in
cataneo
s
box
before
the
overture
the
duke
paid
a
call
on
the
duchess
he
made
a
point
of
standing
behind
her
and
leaving
the
front
seat
to
emilio
next
the
duchess
he
made
a
few
trivial
remarks
without
sarcasm
or
bitterness
and
with
as
polite
a
manner
as
if
he
were
visiting
a
stranger
but
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
seem
amiable
and
natural
the
prince
could
not
control
his
expression
which
was
deeply
anxious
bystanders
would
have
ascribed
such
a
change
in
his
usually
placid
features
to
jealousy
the
duchess
no
doubt
shared
emilio
s
feelings
she
looked
gloomy
and
was
evidently
depressed
the
duke
uncomfortable
enough
between
two
sulky
people
took
advantage
of
the
french
doctor
s
entrance
to
slip
away
monsieur
said
cataneo
to
his
physician
before
dropping
the
curtain
over
the
entrance
to
the
box
you
will
hear
a
grand
musical
poem
not
easy
of
comprehension
at
a
first
hearing
but
in
leaving
you
with
the
duchess
i
know
that
you
can
have
no
more
competent
interpreter
for
she
is
my
the
doctor
like
the
duke
was
struck
by
the
expression
stamped
on
the
faces
of
the
lovers
a
look
of
pining
despair
then
does
an
italian
opera
need
a
guide
to
it
he
asked
massimilla
with
a
smile
recalled
by
this
question
to
her
duties
as
mistress
of
the
box
the
duchess
tried
to
chase
away
the
clouds
that
darkened
her
brow
and
replied
with
eager
haste
to
open
a
conversation
in
which
she
might
vent
her
irritation
this
is
not
so
much
an
opera
monsieur
said
she
as
an
oratorio
a
work
which
is
in
fact
not
unlike
a
most
magnificent
edifice
and
i
shall
with
pleasure
be
your
guide
believe
me
it
will
not
be
too
much
to
give
all
your
mind
to
our
great
rossini
for
you
need
to
be
at
once
a
poet
and
a
musician
to
appreciate
the
whole
bearing
of
such
a
work
you
belong
to
a
race
whose
language
and
genius
are
too
practical
for
it
to
enter
into
music
without
an
effort
but
france
is
too
intellectual
not
to
learn
to
love
it
and
cultivate
it
and
to
succeed
in
that
as
in
everything
else
also
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
music
as
created
by
lulli
rameau
haydn
mozart
beethoven
cimarosa
paisiello
and
rossini
and
as
it
will
be
carried
on
by
the
great
geniuses
of
the
future
is
a
new
art
unknown
to
former
generations
they
had
indeed
no
such
variety
of
instruments
on
which
the
flowers
of
melody
now
blossom
as
on
some
rich
soil
so
novel
an
art
demands
study
in
the
public
study
of
a
kind
that
may
develop
the
feelings
to
which
music
appeals
that
sentiment
hardly
exists
as
yet
among
you
a
nation
given
up
to
philosophical
theories
to
analysis
and
discussion
and
always
torn
by
civil
disturbances
modern
music
demands
perfect
peace
it
is
the
language
of
loving
and
sentimental
souls
inclined
to
lofty
emotional
aspiration
that
language
a
thousand
times
fuller
than
the
language
of
words
is
to
speech
and
ideas
what
the
thought
is
to
its
utterance
it
arouses
sensations
and
ideas
in
their
primitive
form
in
that
part
of
us
where
sensations
and
ideas
have
their
birth
but
leaves
them
as
they
are
in
each
of
us
that
power
over
our
inmost
being
is
one
of
the
grandest
facts
in
music
all
other
arts
present
to
the
mind
a
definite
creation
those
of
music
are
indefinite
infinite
we
are
compelled
to
accept
the
ideas
of
the
poet
the
painter
s
picture
the
sculptor
s
statue
but
music
each
one
can
interpret
at
the
will
of
his
sorrow
or
his
gladness
his
hope
or
his
despair
while
other
arts
restrict
our
mind
by
fixing
it
on
a
predestined
object
music
frees
it
to
roam
over
all
nature
which
it
alone
has
the
power
of
expressing
you
shall
hear
how

s
she
leaned
across
to
the
frenchman
to
speak
to
him
without
being
overheard
moses
is
the
liberator
of
an
enslaved
race
said
she
remember
that
and
you
will
see
with
what
religious
hope
the
whole
house
will
listen
to
the
prayer
of
the
rescued
hebrews
with
what
a
thunder
of
applause
it
will
respond
as
the
leader
raised
his
bow
emilio
flung
himself
into
a
back
seat
the
duchess
pointed
out
the
place
he
had
left
for
the
physician
to
take
it
but
the
frenchman
was
far
more
curious
to
know
what
had
gone
wrong
between
the
lovers
than
to
enter
the
halls
of
music
built
up
by
the
man
whom
all
italy
was
applauding
for
it
was
the
day
of
rossini
s
triumph
in
his
own
country
he
was
watching
the
duchess
and
she
was
talking
with
a
feverish
excitement
she
reminded
him
of
the
niobe
he
had
admired
at
florence
the
same
dignity
in
woe
the
same
physical
control
and
yet
her
soul
shone
though
in
the
warm
flush
of
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
where
anxiety
was
disguised
under
a
flash
of
pride
seemed
to
scorch
the
tears
away
by
their
fire
her
suppressed
grief
seemed
calmer
when
she
looked
at
emilio
who
never
took
his
eyes
off
her
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
was
trying
to
mollify
some
fierce
despair
the
state
of
her
feelings
gave
a
certain
loftiness
to
her
mind
like
most
women
when
under
the
stress
of
some
unusual
agitation
she
overstepped
her
ordinary
limitations
and
assumed
something
of
the
pythoness
though
still
remaining
calm
and
beautiful
for
it
was
the
form
of
her
thoughts
that
was
wrung
with
desperation
not
the
features
of
her
face
and
perhaps
she
wanted
to
shine
with
all
her
wit
to
lend
some
charm
to
life
and
detain
her
lover
from
death
when
the
orchestra
had
given
out
the
three
chords
in
c
major
placed
at
the
opening
by
the
composer
to
announce
that
the
overture
will
be
sung
for
the
real
overture
is
the
great
movement
beginning
with
this
stern
attack
and
ending
only
when
light
appears
at
the
command
of
moses
the
duchess
could
not
control
a
little
spasmodic
start
that
showed
how
entirely
the
music
was
in
accordance
with
her
concealed
distress
those
three
chords
freeze
the
blood
said
she
they
announce
trouble
listen
attentively
to
this
introduction
the
terrible
lament
of
a
nation
stricken
by
the
hand
of
god
what
wailing
the
king
the
queen
their
son
all
the
dignitaries
of
the
kingdom
are
sighing
they
are
wounded
in
their
pride
in
their
conquests
checked
in
their
avarice
dear
rossini
you
have
done
well
to
throw
this
bone
to
gnaw
to
the
who
declared
we
had
no
harmony
no
science
now
you
will
hear
the
ominous
melody
the
maestro
has
engrafted
on
to
this
profound
harmonic
composition
worthy
to
compare
with
the
most
elaborate
structures
of
the
germans
but
never
fatiguing
or
tiresome
you
french
who
carried
through
such
a
bloodthirsty
revolution
who
crushed
your
aristocracy
under
the
paw
of
the
lion
mob
on
the
day
when
this
oratorio
is
performed
in
your
capital
you
will
understand
this
glorious
dirge
of
the
victims
on
whom
god
is
avenging
his
chosen
people
none
but
an
italian
could
have
written
this
pregnant
and
inexhaustible
theme
truly
dantesque
do
you
think
that
it
is
nothing
to
have
such
a
dream
of
vengeance
even
for
a
moment
handel
sebastian
bach
all
you
old
german
masters
nay
even
you
great
beethoven
on
your
knees
here
is
the
queen
of
arts
italy
triumphant
the
duchess
had
spoken
while
the
curtain
was
being
raised
and
now
the
physician
heard
the
sublime
symphony
with
which
the
composer
introduces
the
great
biblical
drama
it
is
to
express
the
sufferings
of
a
whole
nation
suffering
is
uniform
in
its
expression
especially
physical
suffering
thus
having
instinctively
felt
like
all
men
of
genius
that
here
there
must
be
no
variety
of
idea
the
musician
having
hit
on
his
leading
phrase
has
worked
it
out
in
various
keys
grouping
the
masses
and
the
dramatis
personae
to
take
up
the
theme
through
modulations
and
cadences
of
admirable
structure
in
such
simplicity
is
power
the
effect
of
this
strain
depicting
the
sensations
of
night
and
cold
in
a
people
accustomed
to
live
in
the
bright
rays
of
the
sun
and
sung
by
the
people
and
their
princes
is
most
impressive
there
is
something
relentless
in
that
slow
phrase
of
music
it
is
cold
and
sinister
like
an
iron
bar
wielded
by
some
celestial
executioner
and
dropping
in
regular
rhythm
on
the
limbs
of
all
his
victims
as
we
hear
it
passing
from
c
minor
into
g
minor
returning
to
c
and
again
to
the
dominant
g
starting
afresh
and
on
the
tonic
b
flat
drifting
into
f
major
and
back
to
c
minor
and
in
each
key
in
turn
more
ominously
terrible
chill
and
dark
we
are
compelled
at
last
to
enter
into
the
impression
intended
by
the
the
frenchman
was
in
fact
deeply
moved
when
all
this
united
sorrow
exploded
in
the
cry
o

wouldst

thy
faithful
people
free
have
mercy
on
them
and
on
us
never
was
a
grander
synthesis
composed
of
natural
effects
or
a
more
perfect
idealization
of
nature
in
a
great
national
disaster
each
one
for
a
long
time
bewails
himself
alone
then
from
out
of
the
mass
rises
up
here
and
there
a
more
emphatic
and
vehement
cry
of
anguish
finally
when
the
misery
has
fallen
on
all
it
bursts
forth
like
a
tempest
as
soon
as
they
all
recognize
a
common
grievance
the
dull
murmurs
of
the
people
become
cries
of
impatience
rossini
has
proceeded
on
this
hypothesis
after
the
outcry
in
c
major
pharoah
sings
his
grand
recitative
ultrice
di
un
avenging
hand
of
god
after
which
the
original
subject
is
repeated
with
more
vehement
expression
all
egypt
appeals
to
moses
for
the
duchess
had
taken
advantage
of
the
pause
for
the
entrance
of
moses
and
aaron
to
give
this
interpretation
of
that
fine
introduction
let
them
weep
she
added
passionately
they
have
done
much
expiate
your
sins
egyptians
expiate
the
crimes
of
your
maddened
court
with
what
amazing
skill
has
this
great
painter
made
use
of
all
the
gloomy
tones
of
music
of
all
that
is
saddest
on
the
musical
palette
what
creepy
darkness
what
a
mist
is
not
your
very
spirit
in
mourning
are
you
not
convinced
of
the
reality
of
the
blackness
that
lies
over
the
land
do
you
not
feel
that
nature
is
wrapped
in
the
deepest
shades
there
are
no
no
egyptian
palaces
no
landscape
and
what
a
healing
to
your
soul
will
the
deeply
religious
strain
be
of
the
healer
who
will
stay
this
cruel
plague
how
skilfully
is
everything
wrought
up
to
end
in
that
glorious
invocation
of
moses
to
god
by
a
learned
elaboration
which
capraja
could
explain
to
you
this
appeal
to
heaven
is
accompanied
by
brass
instruments
only
it
is
that
which
gives
it
such
a
solemn
religious
cast
and
not
merely
is
the
artifice
fine
in
its
place
note
how
fertile
in
resource
is
genius
rossini
has
derived
fresh
beauty
from
the
difficulty
he
himself
created
he
has
the
strings
in
reserve
to
express
daylight
when
it
succeeds
to
the
darkness
and
thus
produces
one
of
the
greatest
effects
ever
achieved
in
music
till
this
inimitable
genius
showed
the
way
never
was
such
a
result
obtained
with
mere
we
have
not
so
far
had
an
air
or
a
duet
the
poet
has
relied
on
the
strength
of
the
idea
on
the
vividness
of
his
imagery
and
the
realism
of
the
declamatory
passages
this
scene
of
despair
this
darkness
that
may
be
felt
these
cries
of
anguish
the
whole
musical
picture
is
as
fine
as
your
great
poussin
s
moses
waved
his
staff
and
it
was
light
here
monsieur
does
not
the
music
vie
with
the
sun
whose
splendor
it
has
borrowed
with
nature
whose
phenomena
it
expresses
in
every
detail
the
duchess
went
on
in
an
undertone
art
here
reaches
its
climax
no
musician
can
get
beyond
this
do
not
you
hear
egypt
waking
up
after
its
long
torpor
joy
comes
in
with
the
day
in
what
composition
ancient
or
modern
will
you
find
so
grand
a
passage
the
greatest
gladness
in
contrast
to
the
deepest
woe
what
exclamations
what
gleeful
notes
the
oppressed
spirit
breathes
again
what
delirium
in
the
of
the
orchestra
what
a
noble
this
is
the
rejoicing
of
a
delivered
nation
are
you
not
thrilled
with
joy
the
physician
startled
by
the
contrast
was
in
fact
clapping
his
hands
carried
away
by
admiration
for
one
of
the
finest
compositions
of
modern
music
la
doni
said
vendramin
who
had
heard
the
duchess
now
the
introduction
is
ended
said
she
you
have
gone
through
a
great
sensation
she
added
turning
to
the
frenchman
your
heart
is
beating
in
the
depths
of
your
imagination
you
have
a
splendid
sunrise
flooding
with
light
a
whole
country
that
before
was
cold
and
dark
now
would
you
know
the
means
by
which
the
musician
has
worked
so
as
to
admire
him
for
the
secrets
of
his
craft
after
enjoying
the
results
what
do
you
suppose
produces
this
effect
of
daylight
so
sudden
so
complicated
and
so
complete
it
consists
of
a
simple
chord
of
c
constantly
reiterated
varied
only
by
the
chord
of
this
reveals
the
magic
of
his
touch
to
show
you
the
glory
of
light
he
has
worked
by
the
same
means
that
he
used
to
represent
darkness
and
sorrow
this
dawn
in
imagery
is
in
fact
absolutely
the
same
as
the
natural
dawn
for
light
is
one
and
the
same
thing
everywhere
always
alike
in
itself
the
effects
varying
only
with
the
objects
it
falls
on
is
it
not
so
well
the
musician
has
taken
for
the
fundamental
basis
of
his
music
for
its
sole
a
simple
chord
in
the
sun
first
sheds
its
light
on
the
and
then
in
the
valleys
in
the
same
way
the
chord
is
first
heard
on
the
treble
string
of
the
violins
with
boreal
mildness
it
spreads
through
the
orchestra
it
awakes
the
instruments
one
by
one
and
flows
among
them
just
as
light
glides
from
one
thing
to
the
next
giving
them
color
the
music
moves
on
calling
out
each
rill
of
harmony
till
all
flow
together
in
the
the
violins
silent
until
now
give
the
signal
with
their
tender
softly
like
the
first
rays
of
morning
that
light
cheerful
movement
which
caresses
the
soul
is
cleverly
supported
by
chords
in
the
bass
and
by
a
vague
on
the
trumpets
restricted
to
their
lowest
notes
so
as
to
give
a
vivid
idea
of
the
last
cool
shadows
that
linger
in
the
valleys
while
the
first
warm
rays
touch
the
heights
then
all
the
wind
is
gradually
added
to
strengthen
the
general
harmony
the
voices
come
in
with
sighs
of
delight
and
surprise
at
last
the
brass
breaks
out
the
trumpets
sound
light
the
source
of
all
harmony
inundates
all
nature
every
musical
resource
is
produced
with
a
turbulence
a
splendor
to
compare
with
that
of
the
eastern
sun
even
the
triangle
with
its
reiterated
c
reminds
us
by
its
shrill
accent
and
playful
rhythm
of
the
song
of
early
birds
thus
the
same
key
freshly
treated
by
the
master
s
hand
expresses
the
joy
of
all
nature
while
it
soothes
the
grief
it
uttered
before
there
is
the
of
the
great
genius
unity
it
is
the
same
but
different
in
one
and
the
same
phrase
we
find
a
thousand
various
feelings
of
woe
the
misery
of
a
nation
in
one
and
the
same
chord
we
have
all
the
various
incidents
of
awakening
nature
every
expression
of
the
nation
s
joy
these
two
tremendous
passages
are
soldered
into
one
by
the
prayer
to
an
god
author
of
all
things
of
that
woe
and
that
gladness
alike
now
is
not
that
introduction
by
itself
a
grand
poem
it
is
indeed
said
the
frenchman
next
comes
a
quintette
such
as
rossini
can
give
us
if
he
was
ever
justified
in
giving
vent
to
that
flowery
voluptuous
grace
for
which
italian
music
is
blamed
is
it
not
in
this
charming
movement
in
which
each
person
expresses
joy
the
enslaved
people
are
delivered
and
yet
a
passion
in
peril
is
fain
to
moan
pharaoh
s
son
loves
a
hebrew
woman
and
she
must
leave
him
what
gives
its
ravishing
charm
to
this
quintette
is
the
return
to
the
homelier
feelings
of
life
after
the
grandiose
picture
of
two
stupendous
and
national
emotions
general
misery
general
joy
expressed
with
the
magic
force
stamped
on
them
by
divine
vengeance
and
with
the
miraculous
atmosphere
of
the
bible
narrative
now
was
not

the

came

per

cries
of
joy
sound
about
us
the
rainbow
of
peace
dawns
upon
us
how
ingeniously
the
composer
has
constructed
this
passage
she
went
on
after
waiting
for
a
reply
he
begins
with
a
solo
on
the
horn
of
divine
sweetness
supported
by
on
the
harps
for
the
first
voices
to
be
heard
in
this
grand
concerted
piece
are
those
of
moses
and
aaron
returning
thanks
to
the
true
god
their
strain
soft
and
solemn
reverts
to
the
sublime
ideas
of
the
invocation
and
mingles
nevertheless
with
the
joy
of
the
heathen
people
this
transition
combines
the
heavenly
and
the
earthly
in
a
way
which
genius
alone
could
invent
giving
the
of
this
quintette
a
glow
of
color
that
i
can
only
compare
to
the
light
thrown
by
titian
on
his
divine
persons
did
you
observe
the
exquisite
interweaving
of
the
voices
the
clever
entrances
by
which
the
composer
has
grouped
them
round
the
main
idea
given
out
by
the
orchestra
the
learned
progressions
that
prepare
us
for
the
festal
did
you
not
get
a
glimpse
as
it
were
of
dancing
groups
the
dizzy
round
of
a
whole
nation
escaped
from
danger
and
when
the
clarionet
gives
the
signal
for
the
di
so
brilliant
and
gay
was
not
your
soul
filled
with
the
sacred
pyrrhic
joy
of
which
david
speaks
in
the
psalms
ascribing
it
to
the
hills
yes
it
would
make
a
delightful
dance
tune
said
the
doctor
french
french
always
french
exclaimed
the
duchess
checked
in
her
exultant
mood
by
this
sharp
thrust
yes
you
would
be
capable
of
taking
that
wonderful
burst
of
noble
and
dainty
rejoicing
and
turning
it
into
a
rigadoon
sublime
poetry
finds
no
mercy
in
your
eyes
the
highest
genius
saints
kings
disasters
all
that
is
most
sacred
must
pass
under
the
rods
of
caricature
and
the
vulgarizing
of
great
music
by
turning
it
into
a
dance
tune
is
to
caricature
it
with
you
wit
kills
soul
as
argument
kills
they
all
sat
in
silence
through
the
of
osiride
and
membrea
who
plot
to
annul
the
order
given
by
pharaoh
for
the
departure
of
the
hebrews
have
i
vexed
you
asked
the
physician
to
the
duchess
i
should
be
in
despair
your
words
are
like
a
magic
wand
they
unlock
the
of
my
brain
and
let
out
new
ideas
vivified
by
this
sublime
no
replied
she
you
have
praised
our
great
composer
after
your
own
fashion
rossini
will
be
a
success
with
you
for
the
sake
of
his
witty
and
sensual
gifts
let
us
hope
that
he
may
find
some
noble
souls
in
love
with
the
ideal
which
must
exist
in
your
fruitful
land
to
appreciate
the
sublimity
the
loftiness
of
such
music
ah
now
we
have
the
famous
duet
between
elcia
and
osiride
she
exclaimed
and
she
went
on
taking
advantage
of
the
triple
salvo
of
applause
which
hailed
la
tinti
as
she
made
her
first
appearance
on
the
stage
if
la
tinti
has
fully
understood
the
part
of
elcia
you
will
hear
the
frenzied
song
of
a
woman
torn
by
her
love
for
her
people
and
her
passion
for
one
of
their
oppressors
while
osiride
full
of
mad
adoration
for
his
beautiful
vassal
tries
to
detain
her
the
opera
is
built
up
as
much
on
that
grand
idea
as
on
that
of
pharaoh
s
resistance
to
the
power
of
god
and
of
liberty
you
must
enter
into
it
thoroughly
or
you
will
not
understand
this
stupendous
work
notwithstanding
the
disfavor
you
show
to
the
dramas
invented
by
our
writers
you
must
allow
me
to
point
out
the
skill
with
which
this
one
is
constructed
the
antithesis
required
in
every
fine
work
and
eminently
favorable
to
music
is
well
worked
out
what
can
be
finer
than
a
whole
nation
demanding
liberty
held
in
bondage
by
bad
faith
upheld
by
god
and
piling
marvel
on
marvel
to
gain
freedom
what
more
dramatic
than
the
prince
s
love
for
a
hebrew
woman
almost
justifying
treason
to
the
oppressor
s
power
and
this
is
what
is
expressed
in
this
bold
and
stupendous
musical
poem
rossini
has
stamped
each
nation
with
its
fantastic
individuality
for
we
have
attributed
to
them
a
certain
historic
grandeur
to
which
every
imagination
subscribes
the
songs
of
the
hebrews
and
their
trust
in
god
are
perpetually
contrasted
with
pharaoh
s
shrieks
of
rage
and
vain
efforts
represented
with
a
strong
hand
at
this
moment
osiride
thinking
only
of
love
hopes
to
detain
his
mistress
by
the
memories
of
their
joys
as
lovers
he
wants
to
conquer
the
attractions
of
her
feeling
for
her
people
here
then
you
will
find
delicious
languor
the
glowing
sweetness
the
voluptuous
suggestions
of
oriental
love
in
the
air
se
puoi
cosi
sung
by
osiride
and
in
elcia
s
reply
perche
cosi
straziarmi
no
two
hearts
in
such
melodious
unison
could
never
part
she
went
on
looking
at
the
prince
but
the
lovers
are
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
exultant
voice
of
the
hebrew
people
in
the
distance
which
recalls
elcia
what
a
delightful
and
inspiriting
is
the
theme
of
this
march
as
the
israelites
set
out
for
the
desert
no
one
but
rossini
can
make
wind
instruments
and
trumpets
say
so
much
and
is
not
the
art
which
can
express
in
two
phrases
all
that
is
meant
by
the
native
land
certainly
nearer
to
heaven
than
the
others
this
always
moves
me
so
deeply
that
i
can
not
find
words
to
tell
you
how
cruel
it
is
to
an
enslaved
people
to
see
those
who
are
free
march
away
the
duchess
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
she
listened
to
the
grand
movement
which
in
fact
crowns
the
opera
e
mai
quel
core
she
murmured
in
italian
as
la
tinti
began
the
delightful
of
the
in
which
she
implores
pity
for
her
grief
but
what
is
the
matter
the
pit
are
dissatisfied
genovese
is
braying
like
a
stage
replied
the
prince
in
point
of
fact
this
first
duet
with
la
tinti
was
spoilt
by
genovese
s
utter
breakdown
his
excellent
method
recalling
that
of
crescentini
and
veluti
seemed
to
desert
him
completely
a
in
the
wrong
place
an
embellishment
carried
to
excess
spoilt
the
effect
or
again
a
loud
climax
with
no
due
an
outburst
of
sound
like
water
tumbling
through
a
suddenly
opened
sluice
showed
complete
and
wilful
neglect
of
the
laws
of
good
taste
the
pit
was
in
the
greatest
excitement
the
venetian
public
believed
there
was
a
deliberate
plot
between
genovese
and
his
friends
la
tinti
was
recalled
and
applauded
with
frenzy
while
genovese
had
a
hint
or
two
warning
him
of
the
hostile
feeling
of
the
audience
during
this
scene
highly
amusing
to
a
frenchman
while
la
tinti
was
recalled
eleven
times
to
receive
alone
the
frantic
acclamations
of
the
house
genovese
who
was
all
but
hissed
not
daring
to
offer
her
his
hand
the
doctor
made
a
remark
to
the
duchess
as
to
the
of
the
duet
in
this
place
said
he
rossini
ought
to
have
expressed
the
deepest
grief
and
i
find
on
the
contrary
an
airy
movement
a
tone
of
you
are
right
said
she
this
mistake
is
the
result
of
a
tyrannous
custom
which
composers
are
expected
to
obey
he
was
thinking
more
of
his
prima
donna
than
of
elcia
when
he
wrote
that
but
this
evening
even
if
la
tinti
had
been
more
brilliant
than
ever
i
could
throw
myself
so
completely
into
the
situation
that
the
passage
lively
as
it
is
is
to
me
full
of
the
physician
looked
attentively
from
the
prince
to
the
duchess
but
could
not
guess
the
reason
that
held
them
apart
and
that
made
this
duet
seem
to
them
so
heartrending
now
comes
a
magnificent
thing
the
scheming
of
pharaoh
against
the
hebrews
the
great
a
rispettarmi
apprenda
learn
to
respect
me
is
a
triumph
for
carthagenova
who
will
express
superbly
the
offended
pride
and
the
duplicity
of
a
sovereign
the
throne
will
speak
he
will
withdraw
the
concessions
that
have
been
made
he
arms
himself
in
wrath
pharaoh
rises
to
his
feet
to
clutch
the
prey
that
is
escaping
rossini
never
wrote
anything
grander
in
style
or
stamped
with
more
living
and
irresistible
energy
it
is
a
consummate
work
supported
by
an
accompaniment
of
marvelous
orchestration
as
indeed
is
every
portion
of
this
opera
the
vigor
of
youth
illumines
the
smallest
the
whole
house
applauded
this
noble
movement
which
was
admirably
rendered
by
the
singer
and
thoroughly
appreciated
by
the
venetians
in
the
said
the
duchess
you
hear
a
repetition
of
the
march
expressive
of
the
joy
of
deliverance
and
of
faith
in
god
who
allows
his
people
to
rush
off
gleefully
to
wander
in
the
desert
what
lungs
but
would
be
refreshed
by
the
aspirations
of
a
whole
nation
freed
from
slavery
oh
beloved
and
living
melodies
glory
to
the
great
genius
who
has
known
how
to
give
utterance
to
such
feelings
there
is
something
essentially
warlike
in
that
march
proclaiming
that
the
god
of
armies
is
on
the
side
of
these
people
how
full
of
feeling
are
these
strains
of
thanksgiving
the
imagery
of
the
bible
rises
up
in
our
mind
this
glorious
musical
enables
us
to
realize
one
of
the
grandest
dramas
of
that
ancient
and
solemn
world
the
religious
form
given
to
some
of
the
voice
parts
and
the
way
in
which
they
come
in
one
by
one
to
group
with
the
others
express
all
we
have
ever
imagined
of
the
sacred
marvels
of
that
early
age
of
humanity
and
yet
this
fine
concerted
piece
is
no
more
than
a
development
of
the
theme
of
the
march
into
all
its
musical
outcome
that
theme
is
the
inspiring
element
alike
for
the
orchestra
and
the
voices
for
the
air
and
for
the
brilliant
instrumentation
that
supports
it
elcia
now
comes
to
join
the
crowd
and
to
give
shade
to
the
rejoicing
spirit
of
this
number
rossini
has
made
her
utter
her
regrets
listen
to
her
with
amenofi
did
blighted
love
ever
express
itself
in
lovelier
song
it
is
full
of
the
grace
of
a
of
the
secret
grief
of
hopeless
love
how
sad
how
sad
the
desert
will
indeed
be
a
desert
to
her
after
this
comes
the
fierce
conflict
of
the
egyptians
and
the
hebrews
all
their
joy
is
spoiled
their
march
stopped
by
the
arrival
of
the
egyptians
pharaoh
s
edict
is
proclaimed
in
a
musical
phrase
hollow
and
dread
which
is
the
leading
of
the
we
could
fancy
that
we
hear
the
tramp
of
the
great
egyptian
army
surrounding
the
sacred
phalanx
of
the
true
god
curling
round
it
like
a
long
african
serpent
enveloping
its
prey
but
how
beautiful
is
the
lament
of
the
duped
and
disappointed
hebrews
though
in
truth
it
is
more
italian
than
hebrew
what
a
superb
passage
introduces
pharaoh
s
arrival
when
his
presence
brings
the
two
leaders
face
to
face
and
all
the
moving
passions
of
the
drama
the
conflict
of
sentiments
in
that
sublime
where
the
wrath
of
moses
meets
that
of
the
two
pharaohs
is
admirable
what
a
medley
of
voices
and
of
unchained
furies
no
grander
subject
was
ever
wrought
out
by
a
composer
the
famous
of
after
all
only
shows
us
a
libertine
at
odds
with
his
victims
who
invoke
the
vengeance
of
heaven
while
here
earth
and
its
dominions
try
to
defeat
god
two
nations
are
here
face
to
face
and
rossini
having
every
means
at
his
command
has
made
wonderful
use
of
them
he
has
succeeded
in
expressing
the
turmoil
of
a
tremendous
storm
as
a
background
to
the
most
terrible
imprecations
without
making
it
ridiculous
he
has
achieved
it
by
the
use
of
chords
repeated
in
triple
time
a
monotonous
rhythm
of
gloomy
musical
emphasis
and
so
persistent
as
to
be
quite
overpowering
the
horror
of
the
egyptians
at
the
torrent
of
fire
the
cries
of
vengeance
from
the
hebrews
needed
a
delicate
balance
of
masses
so
note
how
he
has
made
the
development
of
the
orchestral
parts
follow
that
of
the
chorus
the
in
c
minor
is
terrible
in
the
midst
of
that
deluge
of
fire
confess
now
said
massimilla
at
the
moment
when
moses
lifting
his
rod
brings
down
the
rain
of
fire
and
when
the
composer
puts
forth
all
his
powers
in
the
orchestra
and
on
the
stage
that
no
music
ever
more
perfectly
expressed
the
idea
of
distress
and
they
have
spread
to
the
pit
remarked
the
frenchman
what
is
it
now
the
pit
is
certainly
in
great
excitement
said
the
duchess
in
the
genovese
his
eyes
fixed
on
la
tinti
had
launched
into
such
preposterous
flourishes
that
the
pit
indignant
at
this
interference
with
their
enjoyment
were
at
a
height
of
uproar
nothing
could
be
more
exasperating
to
italian
ears
than
this
contrast
of
good
and
bad
singing
the
manager
went
so
far
as
to
appear
on
the
stage
to
say
that
in
reply
to
his
remarks
to
his
leading
singer
signor
genovese
had
replied
that
he
knew
not
how
or
by
what
offence
he
had
lost
the
countenance
of
the
public
at
the
very
moment
when
he
was
endeavoring
to
achieve
perfection
in
his
art
let
him
be
as
bad
as
he
was
yesterday
that
was
good
enough
for
us
roared
capraja
in
a
rage
this
suggestion
put
the
house
into
a
good
humor
again
contrary
to
italian
custom
the
ballet
was
not
much
attended
to
in
every
box
the
only
subject
of
conversation
was
genovese
s
strange
behavior
and
the
luckless
manager
s
speech
those
who
were
admitted
behind
the
scenes
went
off
at
once
to
inquire
into
the
mystery
of
this
performance
and
it
was
presently
rumored
that
la
tinti
had
treated
her
colleague
genovese
to
a
dreadful
scene
in
which
she
had
accused
the
tenor
of
being
jealous
of
her
success
of
having
hindered
it
by
his
ridiculous
behavior
and
even
of
trying
to
spoil
her
performance
by
acting
passionate
devotion
the
lady
was
shedding
bitter
tears
over
this
catastrophe
she
had
been
hoping
she
said
to
charm
her
lover
who
was
somewhere
in
the
house
though
she
had
failed
to
discover
him
without
knowing
the
peaceful
course
of
daily
life
in
venice
at
the
present
day
so
devoid
of
incident
that
a
slight
altercation
between
two
lovers
or
the
transient
huskiness
of
a
singer
s
voice
becomes
a
subject
of
discussion
regarded
of
as
much
importance
as
politics
in
england
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
of
the
excitement
in
the
theatre
and
at
the
cafe
florian
la
tinti
was
in
love
la
tinti
had
been
hindered
in
her
performance
genovese
was
mad
or
purposely
malignant
inspired
by
the
artist
s
jealousy
so
familiar
to
italians
what
a
mine
of
matter
for
eager
discussion
the
whole
pit
was
talking
as
men
talk
at
the
bourse
and
the
result
was
such
a
clamor
as
could
not
fail
to
amaze
a
frenchman
accustomed
to
the
quiet
of
the
paris
theatres
the
boxes
were
in
a
ferment
like
the
stir
of
swarming
bees
one
man
alone
remained
passive
in
the
turmoil
emilio
memmi
with
his
back
to
the
stage
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
massimilla
with
a
melancholy
expression
seemed
to
live
in
her
gaze
he
had
not
once
looked
round
at
the
prima
donna
i
need
not
ask
you
what
was
the
result
of
my
negotiation
said
vendramin
to
emilio
your
pure
and
pious
massimilla
has
been
supremely
kind
in
short
she
has
been
la
tinti
the
prince
s
reply
was
a
shake
of
his
head
full
of
the
deepest
melancholy
your
love
has
not
descended
from
the
ethereal
spaces
where
you
soar
said
vendramin
excited
by
opium
it
is
not
yet
materialized
this
morning
as
every
day
for
six
months
you
felt
flowers
opening
their
scented
cups
under
the
dome
of
your
skull
that
had
expanded
to
vast
proportions
all
your
blood
moved
to
your
swelling
heart
that
rose
to
choke
your
throat
there
in
there
and
he
laid
his
hand
on
emilio
s
breast
you
felt
rapturous
emotions
massimilla
s
voice
fell
on
your
soul
in
waves
of
light
her
touch
released
a
thousand
imprisoned
joys
which
emerged
from
the
convolutions
of
your
brain
to
gather
about
you
in
clouds
to
waft
your
etherealized
body
through
the
blue
air
to
a
purple
glow
far
above
the
snowy
heights
to
where
the
pure
love
of
angels
dwells
the
smile
the
kisses
of
her
lips
wrapped
you
in
a
poisoned
robe
which
burnt
up
the
last
vestiges
of
your
earthly
nature
her
eyes
were
twin
stars
that
turned
you
into
shadowless
light
you
knelt
together
on
the
of
heaven
waiting
for
the
gates
of
paradise
to
be
opened
but
they
turned
heavily
on
their
hinges
and
in
your
impatience
you
struck
at
them
but
could
not
reach
them
your
hand
touched
nothing
but
clouds
more
nimble
than
your
desires
your
radiant
companion
crowned
with
white
roses
like
a
bride
of
heaven
wept
at
your
anguish
perhaps
she
was
murmuring
melodious
litanies
to
the
virgin
while
the
demoniacal
cravings
of
the
flesh
were
haunting
you
with
their
shameless
clamor
and
you
disdained
the
divine
fruits
of
that
ecstasy
in
which
i
live
though
shortening
my
your
exaltation
my
dear
vendramin
replied
emilio
calmly
is
still
beneath
reality
who
can
describe
that
purely
physical
exhaustion
in
which
we
are
left
by
the
abuse
of
a
dream
of
pleasure
leaving
the
soul
still
eternally
craving
and
the
spirit
in
clear
possession
of
its
faculties
but
i
am
weary
of
this
torment
which
is
that
of
tantalus
this
is
my
last
night
on
earth
after
one
final
effort
our
mother
shall
have
her
child
again
the
adriatic
will
silence
my
last
sigh
are
you
idiotic
cried
vendramin
no
you
are
mad
for
madness
the
crisis
we
despise
is
the
memory
of
an
antecedent
condition
acting
on
our
present
state
of
being
the
genius
of
my
dreams
has
taught
me
that
and
much
else
you
want
to
make
one
of
the
duchess
and
la
tinti
nay
dear
emilio
take
them
separately
it
will
be
far
wiser
raphael
alone
ever
united
form
and
idea
you
want
to
be
the
raphael
of
love
but
chance
can
not
be
commanded
raphael
was
a
fluke
of
god
s
creation
for
he
foreordained
that
form
and
idea
should
be
antagonistic
otherwise
nothing
could
live
when
the
first
cause
is
more
potent
than
the
outcome
nothing
comes
of
it
we
must
live
either
on
earth
or
in
the
skies
remain
in
the
skies
it
is
always
too
soon
to
come
down
to
i
will
take
the
duchess
home
said
the
prince
and
make
a
last
attempt
afterwards
afterwards
cried
vendramin
anxiously
promise
to
call
for
me
at
florian
i
this
dialogue
in
modern
greek
with
which
vendramin
and
emilio
were
familiar
as
many
venetians
are
was
unintelligible
to
the
duchess
and
to
the
frenchman
although
he
was
quite
outside
the
little
circle
that
held
the
duchess
emilio
and
vendramin
together
for
these
three
understood
each
other
by
means
of
italian
glances
by
turns
arch
and
keen
or
veiled
and
sidelong
the
physician
at
last
discerned
part
of
the
truth
an
earnest
entreaty
from
the
duchess
had
prompted
vendramin
s
suggestion
to
emilio
for
massimilla
had
begun
to
suspect
the
misery
endured
by
her
lover
in
that
cold
empyrean
where
he
was
wandering
though
she
had
no
suspicions
of
la
tinti
these
two
young
men
are
mad
said
the
doctor
as
to
the
prince
said
the
duchess
trust
me
to
cure
him
as
to
vendramin
if
he
can
not
understand
this
sublime
music
he
is
perhaps
if
you
would
but
tell
me
the
cause
of
their
madness
i
could
cure
them
said
the
frenchman
and
since
when
have
great
physicians
ceased
to
read
men
s
minds
said
she
jestingly
the
ballet
was
long
since
ended
the
second
act
of
was
beginning
the
pit
was
perfectly
attentive
a
rumor
had
got
abroad
that
duke
cataneo
had
lectured
genovese
representing
to
him
what
injury
he
was
doing
to
clarina
the
of
the
day
the
second
act
would
certainly
be
magnificent
the
egyptian
prince
and
his
father
are
on
the
stage
said
the
duchess
they
have
yielded
once
more
though
insulting
the
hebrews
but
they
are
trembling
with
rage
the
father
congratulates
himself
on
his
son
s
approaching
marriage
and
the
son
is
in
despair
at
this
fresh
obstacle
though
it
only
increases
his
love
to
which
everything
is
opposed
genovese
and
carthagenova
are
singing
admirably
as
you
see
the
tenor
is
making
his
peace
with
the
house
how
well
he
brings
out
the
beauty
of
the
music
the
phrase
given
out
by
the
son
on
the
tonic
and
repeated
by
the
father
on
the
dominant
is
all
in
character
with
the
simple
serious
scheme
which
prevails
throughout
the
score
the
sobriety
of
it
makes
the
endless
variety
of
the
music
all
the
more
wonderful
all
egypt
is
there
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
in
modern
music
a
composition
more
perfectly
noble
the
solemn
and
majestic
paternity
of
a
king
is
fully
expressed
in
that
magnificent
theme
in
harmony
with
the
grand
style
that
stamps
the
opera
throughout
the
idea
of
a
pharaoh
s
son
pouring
out
his
sorrows
on
his
father
s
bosom
could
surely
not
be
more
admirably
represented
than
in
this
grand
imagery
do
you
not
feel
a
sense
of
the
splendor
we
are
wont
to
attribute
to
that
monarch
of
antiquity
it
is
indeed
sublime
music
said
the
frenchman
the
air
mia
which
the
queen
will
now
sing
is
one
of
those
songs
which
every
composer
is
compelled
to
introduce
though
they
mar
the
general
scheme
of
the
work
but
an
opera
would
as
often
as
not
never
see
the
light
if
the
prima
donna
s
vanity
were
not
duly
flattered
still
this
musical
sop
is
so
fine
in
itself
that
it
is
performed
as
written
on
every
stage
it
is
so
brilliant
that
the
leading
lady
does
not
substitute
her
favorite
show
piece
as
is
very
commonly
done
in
operas
and
now
comes
the
most
striking
movement
in
the
score
the
duet
between
osiride
and
elcia
in
the
subterranean
chamber
where
he
has
hidden
her
to
keep
her
from
the
departing
israelites
and
to
fly
with
her
himself
from
egypt
the
lovers
are
then
intruded
on
by
aaron
who
has
been
to
warn
amalthea
and
we
get
the
grandest
of
all
quartettes
manca
la
voce
mi
sento
this
is
one
of
those
masterpieces
that
will
survive
in
spite
of
time
that
destroyer
of
fashion
in
music
for
it
speaks
the
language
of
the
soul
which
can
never
change
mozart

his
own

by
his

la
what
is
most
to
be
admired
in
rossini
is
his
command
of
variety
to
form
to
produce
the
effect
here
required
he
has
had
recourse
to
the
old
structure
of
the
canon
in
unison
to
bring
the
voices
in
and
merge
them
in
the
same
melody
as
the
form
of
these
sublime
melodies
was
new
he
set
them
in
an
old
frame
and
to
give
it
the
more
relief
he
has
silenced
the
orchestra
accompanying
the
voices
with
the
harps
alone
it
is
impossible
to
show
greater
ingenuity
of
detail
or
to
produce
a
grander
general
dear
me
again
an
outbreak
said
the
duchess
genovese
who
had
sung
his
duet
with
carthagenova
so
well
was
caricaturing
himself
now
that
la
tinti
was
on
the
stage
from
a
great
singer
he
sank
to
the
level
of
the
most
worthless
chorus
singer
the
most
formidable
uproar
arose
that
had
ever
echoed
to
the
roof
of
the
the
commotion
only
yielded
to
clarina
and
she
furious
at
the
difficulties
raised
by
genovese
s
obstinacy
sang
manca
la
as
it
will
never
be
sung
again
the
enthusiasm
was
tremendous
the
audience
forgot
their
indignation
and
rage
in
pleasure
that
was
really
acute
she
floods
my
soul
with
purple
glow
said
capraja
waving
his
hand
in
benediction
at
la
tinti
heaven
send
all
its
blessings
on
your
head
cried
a
gondolier
pharaoh
will
now
revoke
his
commands
said
the
duchess
while
the
commotion
in
the
pit
was
calming
down
moses
will
overwhelm
him
even
on
his
throne
by
declaring
the
death
of
every
son
in
egypt
singing
that
strain
of
vengeance
which
augurs
thunders
from
heaven
while
above
it
the
hebrew
clarions
ring
out
but
you
must
clearly
understand
that
this
air
is
by
pacini
carthagenova
introduces
it
instead
of
that
by
rossini
this
air
will
no
doubt
hold
its
place
in
the
score
it
gives
a
bass
too
good
an
opportunity
for
displaying
the
quality
of
his
voice
and
expression
here
will
carry
the
day
rather
than
science
however
the
air
is
full
of
magnificent
menace
and
it
is
possible
that
we
may
not
be
long
allowed
to
hear
a
thunder
of
clapping
and
hailed
the
song
followed
by
deep
and
cautious
silence
nothing
could
be
more
significant
or
more
thoroughly
venetian
than
the
outbreak
and
its
sudden
suppression
i
need
say
nothing
of
the
coronation
march
announcing
the
enthronement
of
osiride
intended
by
the
king
as
a
challenge
to
moses
to
hear
it
is
enough
their
famous
beethoven
has
written
nothing
grander
and
this
march
full
of
earthly
pomp
contrasts
finely
with
the
march
of
the
israelites
compare
them
and
you
will
see
that
the
music
is
full
of
purpose
elcia
declares
her
love
in
the
presence
of
the
two
hebrew
leaders
and
then
renounces
it
in
the
fine
la
destra
place
your
beloved
hand
ah
what
anguish
only
look
at
the
house
the
pit
was
shouting
when
genovese
left
the
stage
now
free
from
her
deplorable
lover
we
shall
hear
tinti
sing
desolata
the
tremendous
expressive
of
love
disapproved
by
where
art
thou
rossini
cried
cataneo
if
he
could
but
hear
the
music
created
by
his
genius
so
magnificently
performed
he
went
on
is
not
clarina
worthy
of
him
he
asked
capraja
to
give
life
to
those
notes
by
such
gusts
of
flame
starting
from
the
lungs
and
feeding
in
the
air
on
some
unknown
matter
which
our
ears
inhale
and
which
bears
us
heavenwards
in
a
rapture
of
love
she
must
be
divine
she
is
like
the
gorgeous
indian
plant
which
deserting
the
earth
absorbs
invisible
nourishment
from
the
atmosphere
and
sheds
from
its
spiral
white
blossom
such
fragrant
vapors
as
fill
the
brain
with
dreams
replied
capraja
on
being
recalled
la
tinti
appeared
alone
she
was
received
with
a
storm
of
applause
a
thousand
kisses
were
blown
to
her
from
she
was
pelted
with
roses
and
a
wreath
was
made
of
the
flowers
snatched
from
the
ladies
caps
almost
all
sent
out
from
paris
the
was
encored
how
eagerly
capraja
with
his
passion
for
embellishments
must
have
looked
forward
to
this
air
which
derives
all
its
value
from
execution
remarked
massimilla
here
rossini
has
so
to
speak
given
the
reins
over
to
the
singer
s
fancy
her
and
her
feeling
are
everything
with
a
poor
voice
or
inferior
execution
it
would
be
nothing
the
throat
is
responsible
for
the
effects
of
this
the
singer
has
to
express
the
most
intense
anguish
that
of
a
woman
who
sees
her
lover
dying
before
her
very
eyes
la
tinti
makes
the
house
ring
with
her
highest
notes
and
rossini
to
leave
pure
singing
free
to
do
its
utmost
has
written
it
in
the
simplest
clearest
style
then
as
a
crowning
effort
he
has
composed
those
heartrending
musical
cries
affanni
smanie
what
grief
what
anguish
in
those
runs
and
la
tinti
you
see
has
quite
carried
the
house
off
its
the
frenchman
bewildered
by
this
adoring
admiration
throughout
a
vast
theatre
for
the
source
of
its
delight
here
had
a
glimpse
of
genuine
italian
nature
but
neither
the
duchess
nor
the
two
young
men
paid
any
attention
to
the
ovation
clarina
began
again
the
duchess
feared
that
she
was
seeing
her
emilio
for
the
last
time
as
to
the
prince
in
the
presence
of
the
duchess
the
sovereign
divinity
who
lifted
him
to
the
skies
he
had
forgotten
where
he
was
he
no
longer
heard
the
voice
of
the
woman
who
had
initiated
him
into
the
mysteries
of
earthly
pleasure
for
deep
dejection
made
his
ears
tingle
with
a
chorus
of
plaintive
voices
in
a
rushing
noise
as
of
pouring
rain
vendramin
saw
himself
in
an
ancient
venetian
costume
looking
on
at
the
ceremony
of
the
the
frenchman
who
plainly
discerned
that
some
strange
and
painful
mystery
stood
between
the
prince
and
the
duchess
was
racking
his
brain
with
shrewd
conjecture
to
discover
what
it
could
be
the
scene
had
changed
in
front
of
a
fine
picture
representing
the
desert
and
the
red
sea
the
egyptians
and
hebrews
marched
and
countermarched
without
any
effect
on
the
feelings
of
the
four
persons
in
the
duchess
box
but
when
the
first
chords
on
the
harps
preluded
the
hymn
of
the
delivered
israelites
the
prince
and
vendramin
rose
and
stood
leaning
against
the
opposite
sides
of
the
box
and
the
duchess
resting
her
elbow
on
the
velvet
ledge
supported
her
head
on
her
left
hand
the
frenchman
understanding
from
this
little
stir
how
important
this
justly
famous
chorus
was
in
the
opinion
of
the
house
listened
with
devout
attention
the
audience
with
one
accord
shouted
for
its
repetition
i
feel
as
if
i
were
celebrating
the
liberation
of
italy
thought
a
milanese
such
music
lifts
up
bowed
heads
and
revives
hope
in
the
most
torpid
said
a
man
from
the
romagna
in
this
scene
said
massimilla
whose
emotion
was
evident
science
is
set
aside
inspiration
alone
dictated
this
masterpiece
it
rose
from
the
composer
s
soul
like
a
cry
of
love
as
to
the
accompaniment
it
consists
of
the
harps
the
orchestra
appears
only
at
the
last
repetition
of
that
heavenly
strain
rossini
can
never
rise
higher
than
in
this
prayer
he
will
do
as
good
work
no
doubt
but
never
better
the
sublime
is
always
equal
to
itself
but
this
hymn
is
one
of
the
things
that
will
always
be
sublime
the
only
match
for
such
a
conception
might
be
found
in
the
psalms
of
the
great
marcello
a
noble
venetian
who
was
to
music
what
giotto
was
to
painting
the
majesty
of
the
phrase
unfolding
itself
with
episodes
of
inexhaustible
melody
is
comparable
with
the
finest
things
ever
invented
by
religious
writers
how
simple
is
the
structure
moses
opens
the
attack
in
g
minor
ending
in
a
cadenza
in
b
flat
which
allows
the
chorus
to
come
in
at
first
in
b
flat
returning
by
modulations
to
g
minor
this
splendid
treatment
of
the
voices
recurring
three
times
ends
in
the
last
strophe
with
a
in
g
major
of
absolutely
overpowering
effect
we
feel
as
though
this
hymn
of
a
nation
released
from
slavery
as
it
mounts
to
heaven
were
met
by
kindred
strains
falling
from
the
higher
spheres
the
stars
respond
with
joy
to
the
ecstasy
of
liberated
mortals
the
rounded
fulness
of
the
rhythm
the
deliberate
dignity
of
the
graduations
leading
up
to
the
outbursts
of
thanksgiving
and
its
slow
return
raise
heavenly
images
in
the
soul
could
you
not
fancy
that
you
saw
heaven
open
angels
holding
sistrums
of
gold
prostrate
seraphs
swinging
their
fragrant
censers
and
the
archangels
leaning
on
the
flaming
swords
with
which
they
have
vanquished
the
heathen
the
secret
of
this
music
and
its
refreshing
effect
on
the
soul
is
i
believe
that
of
a
very
few
works
of
human
genius
it
carries
us
for
the
moment
into
the
infinite
we
feel
it
within
us
we
see
it
in
those
melodies
as
boundless
as
the
hymns
sung
round
the
throne
of
god
rossini
s
genius
carries
us
up
to
prodigious
heights
whence
we
look
down
on
a
promised
land
and
our
eyes
charmed
by
heavenly
light
gaze
into
limitless
space
elcia
s
last
strain
having
almost
recovered
from
her
grief
brings
a
feeling
of
passions
into
this
hymn
of
thanksgiving
this
again
is
a
touch
of
genius
ay
sing
exclaimed
the
duchess
as
she
listened
to
the
last
stanza
with
the
same
gloomy
enthusiasm
as
the
singers
threw
into
it
sing
you
are
free
the
words
were
spoken
in
a
voice
that
startled
the
physician
to
divert
massimilla
from
her
bitter
reflections
while
the
excitement
of
recalling
la
tinti
was
at
its
height
he
engaged
her
in
one
of
the
arguments
in
which
the
french
excel
madame
said
he
in
explaining
this
grand
work
which
i
shall
come
to
hear
again
with
a
fuller
comprehension
thanks
to
you
of
its
structure
and
its
effect
you
have
frequently
spoken
of
the
color
of
the
music
and
of
the
ideas
it
depicts
now
i
as
an
analyst
a
materialist
must
confess
that
i
have
always
rebelled
against
the
affectation
of
certain
enthusiasts
who
try
to
make
us
believe
that
music
paints
with
tones
would
it
not
be
the
same
thing
if
raphael
s
admirers
spoke
of
his
singing
with
colors
in
the
language
of
musicians
replied
the
duchess
is
arousing
certain
associations
in
our
souls
or
certain
images
in
our
brain
and
these
memories
and
images
have
a
color
of
their
own
they
are
sad
or
cheerful
you
are
battling
for
a
word
that
is
all
according
to
capraja
each
instrument
has
its
task
its
mission
and
appeals
to
certain
feelings
in
our
souls
does
a
pattern
in
gold
on
a
blue
ground
produce
the
same
sensations
in
you
as
a
red
pattern
on
black
or
green
in
these
as
in
music
there
are
no
figures
no
expression
of
feeling
they
are
purely
artistic
and
yet
no
one
looks
at
them
with
indifference
has
not
the
oboe
the
peculiar
tone
that
we
associate
with
the
open
country
in
common
with
most
wind
instruments
the
brass
suggests
martial
ideas
and
rouses
us
to
vehement
or
even
somewhat
furious
feelings
the
strings
for
which
the
material
is
derived
from
the
organic
world
seem
to
appeal
to
the
subtlest
fibres
of
our
nature
they
go
to
the
very
depths
of
the
heart
when
i
spoke
of
the
gloomy
hue
and
the
coldness
of
the
tones
in
the
introduction
to
was
i
not
fully
as
much
justified
as
your
critics
are
when
they
speak
of
the
color
in
a
writer
s
language
do
you
not
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
nervous
style
a
pallid
style
a
lively
and
a
style
art
can
paint
with
words
sounds
colors
lines
form
the
means
are
many
the
result
is
one
an
italian
architect
might
give
us
the
same
sensation
that
is
produced
in
us
by
the
introduction
to
by
constructing
a
walk
through
dark
damp
avenues
of
tall
thick
trees
and
bringing
us
out
suddenly
in
a
valley
full
of
streams
flowers
and
mills
and
basking
in
the
sunshine
in
their
greatest
moments
the
arts
are
but
the
expression
of
the
grand
scenes
of
nature
i
am
not
learned
enough
to
enlarge
on
the
philosophy
of
music
go
and
talk
to
capraja
you
will
be
amazed
at
what
he
can
tell
you
he
will
say
that
every
instrument
that
depends
on
the
touch
or
breath
of
man
for
its
expression
and
length
of
note
is
superior
as
a
vehicle
of
expression
to
color
which
remains
fixed
or
speech
which
has
its
limits
the
language
of
music
is
infinite
it
includes
everything
it
can
express
all
things
now
do
you
see
wherein
lies
the
of
the
work
you
have
just
heard
i
can
explain
it
in
a
few
words
there
are
two
kinds
of
music
one
petty
poor
always
the
same
based
on
a
hundred
or
so
of
phrases
which
every
musician
has
at
his
command
a
more
or
less
agreeable
form
of
babble
which
most
composers
live
in
we
listen
to
their
strains
their
melodies
with
more
or
less
satisfaction
but
absolutely
nothing
is
left
in
our
mind
by
the
end
of
the
century
they
are
forgotten
but
the
nations
from
the
beginning
of
time
till
our
own
day
have
cherished
as
a
precious
treasure
certain
strains
which
epitomize
their
instincts
and
habits
i
might
almost
say
their
history
listen
to
one
of
these
primitive
tones
the
gregorian
chant
for
instance
is
in
sacred
song
the
inheritance
of
the
earliest
peoples
and
you
will
lose
yourself
in
deep
dreaming
strange
and
immense
conceptions
will
unfold
within
you
in
spite
of
the
extreme
simplicity
of
these
rudimentary
relics
and
once
or
twice
in
a
century
not
oftener
there
arises
a
homer
of
music
to
whom
god
grants
the
gift
of
being
ahead
of
his
age
men
who
can
compact
melodies
full
of
accomplished
facts
pregnant
with
mighty
poetry
think
of
this
remember
it
the
thought
repeated
by
you
will
prove
fruitful
it
is
melody
not
harmony
that
can
survive
the
shocks
of
time
the
music
of
this
oratorio
contains
a
whole
world
of
great
and
sacred
things
a
work
which
begins
with
that
introduction
and
ends
with
that
prayer
is
immortal
as
immortal
as
the
easter
hymn
filii
et
as
the
of
the
dead
as
all
the
songs
which
in
every
land
have
outlived
its
splendor
its
happiness
and
its
ruined
the
tears
the
duchess
wiped
away
as
she
quitted
her
box
showed
plainly
that
she
was
thinking
of
the
venice
that
is
no
more
and
vendramin
kissed
her
hand
the
performance
ended
with
the
most
extraordinary
chaos
of
noises
abuse
and
hisses
hurled
at
genovese
and
a
fit
of
frenzy
in
praise
of
la
tinti
it
was
a
long
time
since
the
venetians
had
had
so
lively
an
evening
they
were
warmed
and
revived
by
that
antagonism
which
is
never
lacking
in
italy
where
the
smallest
towns
always
throve
on
the
antagonistic
interests
of
two
factions
the
geulphs
and
ghibellines
everywhere
the
capulets
and
the
montagues
at
verona
the
geremei
and
the
lomelli
at
bologna
the
fieschi
and
the
doria
at
genoa
the
patricians
and
the
populace
the
senate
and
tribunes
of
the
roman
republic
the
pazzi
and
the
medici
at
florence
the
sforza
and
the
visconti
at
milan
the
orsini
and
the
colonna
at
rome
in
short
everywhere
and
on
every
occasion
there
has
been
the
same
impulse
out
in
the
streets
there
were
already
and
the
prince
escorted
the
duchess
more
depressed
than
ever
by
the
loves
of
osiride
she
feared
some
similar
disaster
to
her
own
and
could
only
cling
to
emilio
as
if
to
keep
him
next
her
heart
remember
your
promise
said
vendramin
i
will
wait
for
you
in
the
vendramin
took
the
frenchman
s
arm
proposing
that
they
should
walk
together
on
the
piazza
san
marco
while
awaiting
the
prince
i
shall
be
only
too
glad
if
he
should
not
come
he
added
this
was
the
text
for
a
conversation
between
the
two
vendramin
regarding
it
as
a
favorable
opportunity
for
consulting
the
physician
and
telling
him
the
singular
position
emilio
had
placed
himself
in
the
frenchman
did
as
every
frenchman
does
on
all
occasions
he
laughed
vendramin
who
took
the
matter
very
seriously
was
angry
but
he
was
mollified
when
the
disciple
of
majendie
of
cuvier
of
dupuytren
and
of
brossais
assured
him
that
he
believed
he
could
cure
the
prince
of
his
raptures
and
dispel
the
heavenly
poetry
in
which
he
shrouded
massimilla
as
in
a
cloud
a
happy
form
of
misfortune
said
he
the
ancients
who
were
not
such
fools
as
might
be
inferred
from
their
crystal
heaven
and
their
ideas
on
physics
symbolized
in
the
fable
of
ixion
the
power
which
nullifies
the
body
and
makes
the
spirit
lord
of
vendramin
and
the
doctor
presently
met
genovese
and
with
him
the
fantastic
capraja
the
melomaniac
was
anxious
to
learn
the
real
cause
of
the
tenor
s
genovese
the
question
being
put
to
him
talked
fast
like
all
men
who
can
intoxicate
themselves
by
the
ebullition
of
ideas
suggested
to
them
by
a
passion
yes
signori
i
love
her
i
worship
her
with
a
frenzy
of
which
i
never
believed
myself
capable
now
that
i
am
tired
of
women
women
play
the
mischief
with
art
pleasure
and
work
can
not
be
carried
on
together
clara
fancies
that
i
was
jealous
of
her
success
that
i
wanted
to
hinder
her
triumph
at
venice
but
i
was
clapping
in
the
and
shouted
louder
than
any
one
in
the
but
even
that
said
cataneo
joining
them
does
not
explain
why
from
being
a
divine
singer
you
should
have
become
one
of
the
most
execrable
performers
who
ever
piped
air
through
his
larynx
giving
none
of
the
charm
even
which
enchants
and
bewitches
i
said
the
singer
i
a
bad
singer
i
who
am
the
equal
of
the
greatest
performers
by
this
time
the
doctor
and
vendramin
capraja
cataneo
and
genovese
had
made
their
way
to
the
piazzetta
it
was
midnight
the
glittering
bay
outlined
by
the
churches
of
san
giorgio
and
san
paulo
at
the
end
of
the
giudecca
and
the
beginning
of
the
grand
canal
that
opens
so
mysteriously
under
the
and
the
church
of
santa
maria
della
salute
lay
glorious
and
still
the
moon
shone
on
the
barques
along
the
riva
de
schiavoni
the
waters
of
venice
where
there
is
no
tide
looked
as
if
they
were
alive
dancing
with
a
myriad
spangles
never
had
a
singer
a
more
splendid
stage
genovese
with
an
emphatic
flourish
seemed
to
call
heaven
and
earth
to
witness
and
then
with
no
accompaniment
but
the
lapping
waves
he
sang
crescentini
s
great
air
the
song
rising
up
between
the
statues
of
san
teodoro
and
san
giorgio
in
the
heart
of
sleeping
venice
lighted
by
the
moon
the
words
in
such
strange
harmony
with
the
scene
and
the
melancholy
passion
of
the
singer
held
the
italians
and
the
frenchman
spellbound
at
the
very
first
notes
vendramin
s
face
was
wet
with
tears
capraja
stood
as
motionless
as
one
of
the
statues
in
the
ducal
palace
cataneo
seemed
moved
to
some
feeling
the
frenchman
taken
by
surprise
was
meditative
like
a
man
of
science
in
the
presence
of
a
phenomenon
that
upsets
all
his
fundamental
axioms
these
four
minds
all
so
different
whose
hopes
were
so
small
who
believed
in
nothing
for
themselves
or
after
themselves
who
regarded
their
own
existence
as
that
of
a
transient
and
a
fortuitous
being
like
the
little
life
of
a
plant
or
a
beetle
had
a
glimpse
of
heaven
never
did
music
more
truly
merit
the
epithet
divine
the
consoling
notes
as
they
were
poured
out
enveloped
their
souls
in
soft
and
soothing
airs
on
these
vapors
almost
visible
as
it
seemed
to
the
listeners
like
the
marble
shapes
about
them
in
the
silver
moonlight
angels
sat
whose
wings
devoutly
waving
expressed
adoration
and
love
the
simple
artless
melody
penetrated
to
the
soul
as
with
a
beam
of
light
it
was
a
holy
passion
but
the
singer
s
vanity
roused
them
from
their
emotion
with
a
terrible
shock
now
am
i
a
bad
singer
he
exclaimed
as
he
ended
his
audience
only
regretted
that
the
instrument
was
not
a
thing
of
heaven
this
angelic
song
was
then
no
more
than
the
outcome
of
a
man
s
offended
vanity
the
singer
felt
nothing
thought
nothing
of
the
pious
sentiments
and
divine
images
he
could
create
in
others
no
more
in
fact
than
paganini
s
violin
knows
what
the
player
makes
it
utter
what
they
had
seen
in
fancy
was
venice
lifting
its
shroud
and
singing
and
it
was
merely
the
result
of
a
tenor
s
can
you
guess
the
meaning
of
such
a
phenomenon
the
frenchman
asked
of
capraja
wishing
to
make
him
talk
as
the
duchess
had
spoken
of
him
as
a
profound
thinker
what
phenomenon
said
capraja
genovese
who
is
admirable
in
the
absence
of
la
tinti
and
when
he
sings
with
her
is
a
braying
he
obeys
an
occult
law
of
which
one
of
your
chemists
might
perhaps
give
you
the
mathematical
formula
and
which
the
next
century
will
no
doubt
express
in
a
statement
full
of
and
mixed
up
with
little
algebraic
signs
bars
and
quirks
that
give
me
the
colic
for
the
finest
conceptions
of
mathematics
do
not
add
much
to
the
sum
total
of
our
enjoyment
when
an
artist
is
so
unfortunate
as
to
be
full
of
the
passion
he
wishes
to
express
he
can
not
depict
it
because
he
is
the
thing
itself
instead
of
its
image
art
is
the
work
of
the
brain
not
of
the
heart
when
you
are
possessed
by
a
subject
you
are
a
slave
not
a
master
you
are
like
a
king
besieged
by
his
people
too
keen
a
feeling
at
the
moment
when
you
want
to
represent
that
feeling
causes
an
insurrection
of
the
senses
against
the
governing
might
we
not
convince
ourselves
of
this
by
some
further
experiment
said
the
doctor
cataneo
you
might
bring
your
tenor
and
the
prima
donna
together
again
said
capraja
to
his
friend
well
gentlemen
said
the
duke
come
to
sup
with
me
we
ought
to
reconcile
the
tenor
and
la
clarina
otherwise
the
season
will
be
ruined
in
the
invitation
was
accepted
gondoliers
called
cataneo
one
minute
said
vendramin
memmi
is
waiting
for
me
at
florian
s
i
can
not
leave
him
to
himself
we
must
make
him
tipsy
or
he
will
kill
himself
santo
exclaimed
the
duke
i
must
keep
that
young
fellow
alive
for
the
happiness
and
future
prospects
of
my
race
i
will
invite
him
they
all
went
back
to
florian
s
where
the
assembled
crowd
were
holding
an
eager
and
stormy
discussion
to
which
the
tenor
s
arrival
put
an
end
in
one
corner
near
a
window
looking
out
on
the
colonnade
gloomy
with
a
fixed
gaze
and
rigid
attitude
emilio
was
a
dismal
image
of
despair
that
crazy
fellow
said
the
physician
in
french
to
vendramin
does
not
know
what
he
wants
here
is
a
man
who
can
make
of
a
massimilla
doni
a
being
apart
from
the
rest
of
creation
possessing
her
in
heaven
amid
ideal
splendor
such
as
no
power
on
earth
can
make
real
he
can
behold
his
mistress
for
ever
sublime
and
pure
can
always
hear
within
him
what
we
have
just
heard
on
the
seashore
can
always
live
in
the
light
of
a
pair
of
eyes
which
create
for
him
the
warm
and
golden
glow
that
surrounds
the
virgin
in
titian
s
assumption
after
raphael
had
invented
it
or
had
it
revealed
to
him
for
the
transfiguration
and
this
man
only
longs
to
smirch
the
poem
by
my
advice
he
must
needs
combine
his
sensual
joys
and
his
heavenly
adoration
in
one
woman
in
short
like
all
the
rest
of
us
he
will
have
a
mistress
he
had
a
divinity
and
the
wretched
creature
insists
on
her
being
a
female
i
assure
you
monsieur
he
is
resigning
heaven
i
will
not
answer
for
it
that
he
may
not
ultimately
die
of
despair
o
ye
women
s
faces
delicately
outlined
in
a
pure
and
radiant
oval
reminding
us
of
those
creations
of
art
where
it
has
most
successfully
competed
with
nature
divine
feet
that
can
not
walk
slender
forms
that
an
earthly
breeze
would
break
shapes
too
frail
ever
to
conceive
virgins
that
we
dreamed
of
as
we
grew
out
of
childhood
admired
in
secret
and
adored
without
hope
veiled
in
the
beams
of
some
unwearying
desire
maids
whom
we
may
never
see
again
but
whose
smile
remains
supreme
in
our
life
what
hog
of
epicurus
could
insist
on
dragging
you
down
to
the
mire
of
this
earth

he
added
looking
at
capraja
not
so
bad
for
a
frenchman
and
a
doctor
said
capraja

the

on

said
the
duke
to

come
and
sup
with

you
can
not
refuse
the
poor
neapolitan
whom
you
have
robbed
both
of
his
wife
and
of
his
this
broad
neapolitan
jest
spoken
with
an
aristocratic
good
manner
made
emilio
smile
he
allowed
the
duke
to
take
his
arm
and
lead
him
away
cataneo
had
already
sent
a
messenger
to
his
house
from
the
cafe
as
the
palazzo
memmi
was
on
the
grand
canal
not
far
from
santa
maria
della
salute
the
way
thither
on
foot
was
round
by
the
rialto
or
it
could
be
reached
in
a
gondola
the
four
guests
would
not
separate
and
preferred
to
walk
the
duke
s
infirmities
obliged
him
to
get
into
his
gondola
at
about
two
in
the
morning
anybody
passing
the
memmi
palace
would
have
seen
light
pouring
out
of
every
window
across
the
grand
canal
and
have
heard
the
delightful
overture
to
performed
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
by
the
orchestra
of
the
as
a
serenade

were
at
supper

from

s
from
while
the
duke
s
steward
distributed
payment
from
his
master
to
the
poor
artists
and
bid
them
to
dinner
the
next
day
such
civilities
as
are
expected
of
grand
signors
who
protect
singers
and
of
fine
ladies
who
protect
tenors
and
basses
in
these
cases
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
marry
all
the
de
cataneo
did
things
handsomely
he
was
the
manager
s
banker
and
this
season
was
costing
him
two
thousand
crowns
he
had
had
all
the
palace
furnished
had
imported
a
french
cook
and
wines
of
all
lands
so
the
supper
was
a
regal
entertainment
the
prince
seated
next
la
tinti
was
keenly
alive
all
through
the
meal
to
what
poets
in
every
language
call
the
darts
of
love
the
transcendental
vision
of
massimilla
was
eclipsed
just
as
the
idea
of
god
is
sometimes
hidden
by
clouds
of
doubt
in
the
consciousness
of
solitary
thinkers
clarina
thought
herself
the
happiest
woman
in
the
world
as
she
perceived
emilio
was
in
love
with
her
confident
of
retaining
him
her
joy
was
reflected
in
her
features
her
beauty
was
so
dazzling
that
the
men
as
they
lifted
their
glasses
could
not
resist
bowing
to
her
with
instinctive
admiration
the
duchess
is
not
to
compare
with
la
tinti
said
the
frenchman
forgetting
his
theory
under
the
fire
of
the
sicilian
s
eyes
the
tenor
ate
and
drank
languidly
he
seemed
to
care
only
to
identify
himself
with
the
prima
donna
s
life
and
had
lost
the
hearty
sense
of
enjoyment
which
is
characteristic
of
italian
men
singers
come
signorina
said
the
duke
with
an
imploring
glance
at
clarina
and
you
prima
he
added
to
genovese
unite
your
voices
in
one
perfect
sound
let
us
have
the
c
of
when
light
appears
in
the
oratorio
we
have
just
heard
to
convince
my
old
friend
capraja
of
the
superiority
of
unison
to
any
i
will
carry
her
off
from
that
prince
she
is
in
love
with
for
she
adores
him
it
stares
me
in
the
face
said
genovese
to
himself
what
was
the
amazement
of
the
guests
who
had
heard
genovese
out
of
doors
when
he
began
to
bray
to
coo
mew
squeal
gargle
bellow
thunder
bark
shriek
even
produce
sounds
which
could
only
be
described
as
a
hoarse
rattle
in
short
go
through
an
incomprehensible
farce
while
his
face
was
transfigured
with
rapturous
expression
like
that
of
a
martyr
as
painted
by
zurbaran
or
murillo
titian
or
raphael
the
general
shout
of
laughter
changed
to
almost
tragical
gravity
when
they
saw
that
genovese
was
in
utter
earnest
la
tinti
understood
that
her
companion
was
in
love
with
her
and
had
spoken
the
truth
on
the
stage
the
land
of
falsehood
she
murmured
stroking
the
prince
s
hand
under
the
table
by
all
that
is
holy
cried
capraja
will
you
tell
me
what
score
you
are
reading
at
this
moment
murdering
rossini
pray
inform
us
what
you
are
thinking
about
what
demon
is
struggling
in
your
a
demon
cried
genovese
say
rather
the
god
of
music
my
eyes
like
those
of
can
see
angels
who
pointing
with
their
fingers
guide
me
along
the
lines
of
the
score
which
is
written
in
notes
of
fire
and
i
am
trying
to
keep
up
with
them
per
dio
do
you
not
understand
the
feeling
that
inspires
me
has
passed
into
my
being
it
fills
my
heart
and
my
lungs
my
soul
and
throat
have
but
one
life
have
you
never
in
a
dream
listened
to
the
most
glorious
strains
the
ideas
of
unknown
composers
who
have
made
use
of
pure
sound
as
nature
has
hidden
it
in
all
things
sound
which
we
call
forth
more
or
less
perfectly
by
the
instruments
we
employ
to
produce
masses
of
various
color
but
which
in
those
are
heard
free
from
the
imperfections
of
the
performers
who
can
not
be
all
feeling
all
soul
and
i
i
give
you
that
perfection
and
you
abuse
me
you
are
as
mad
at
the
pit
of
the
who
hissed
me
i
scorned
the
vulgar
crowd
for
not
being
able
to
mount
with
me
to
the
heights
whence
we
reign
over
art
and
i
appeal
to
men
of
mark
to
a
frenchman
why
he
is
gone
half
an
hour
ago
said
vendramin
that
is
a
pity
he
perhaps
would
have
understood
me
since
italians
lovers
of
art
do
not
on
you
go
said
capraja
with
a
smile
and
tapping
lightly
on
the
tenor

head
ride
off
on
the

ariosto

hippogriff
hunt
down
your
radiant
chimera
musical
visionary
as
you
are
in
point
of
fact
all
the
others
believing
that
genovese
was
drunk
let
him
talk
without
listening
to
him
capraja
alone
had
understood
the
case
put
by
the
french
physician
while
the
wine
of
cyprus
was
loosening
every
tongue
and
each
one
was
prancing
on
his
favorite
hobby
the
doctor
in
a
gondola
was
waiting
for
the
duchess
having
sent
her
a
note
written
by
vendramin
massimilla
appeared
in
her
night
wrapper
so
much
had
she
been
alarmed
by
the
tone
of
the
prince
s
farewell
and
so
startled
by
the
hopes
held
out
by
the
letter
madame
said
the
frenchman
as
he
placed
her
in
a
seat
and
desired
the
gondoliers
to
start
at
this
moment
prince
emilio
s
life
is
in
danger
and
you
alone
can
save
what
is
to
be
done
she
asked
ah
can
you
resign
yourself
to
play
a
degrading
part
in
spite
of
the
noblest
face
to
be
seen
in
italy
can
you
drop
from
the
blue
sky
where
you
dwell
into
the
bed
of
a
courtesan
in
short
can
you
an
angel
of
refinement
of
pure
and
spotless
beauty
condescend
to
imagine
what
the
love
must
be
of
a
tinti
in
her
room
and
so
effectually
as
to
deceive
the
ardor
of
emilio
who
is
indeed
too
drunk
to
be
very
is
that
all
said
she
with
a
smile
that
betrayed
to
the
frenchman
a
side
he
had
not
as
yet
perceived
of
the
delightful
nature
of
an
italian
woman
in
love
i
will
la
tinti
if
need
be
to
save
my
friend
s
and
you
will
thus
fuse
into
one
two
kinds
of
love
which
he
sees
as
distinct
divided
by
a
mountain
of
poetic
fancy
that
will
melt
away
like
the
snow
on
a
glacier
under
the
beams
of
the
midsummer
i
shall
be
eternally
your
debtor
said
the
duchess
gravely
when
the
french
doctor
returned
to
the
gallery
where
the
orgy
had
by
this
time
assumed
the
stamp
of
venetian
frenzy
he
had
a
look
of
satisfaction
which
the
prince
absorbed
by
la
tinti
failed
to
observe
he
was
promising
himself
a
repetition
of
the
intoxicating
delights
he
had
known
la
tinti
a
true
sicilian
was
floating
on
the
tide
of
a
fantastic
passion
on
the
point
of
being
gratified
the
doctor
whispered
a
few
words
to
vendramin
and
la
tinti
was
uneasy
what
are
you
plotting
she
inquired
of
the
prince
s
friend
are
you
said
the
doctor
in
her
ear
with
the
sternness
of
an
operator
the
words
pierced
to
her
comprehension
like
a
to
her
heart
it
is
to
save
emilio
s
life
added
vendramin
come
here
said
the
doctor
to
clarina
the
hapless
singer
rose
and
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
table
where
between
vendramin
and
the
frenchman
she
looked
like
a
criminal
between
the
confessor
and
the
executioner
she
struggled
for
a
long
time
but
yielded
at
last
for
love
of
emilio
the
doctor
s
last
words
were
and
you
must
cure
genovese
she
spoke
a
word
to
the
tenor
as
she
went
round
the
table
she
returned
to
the
prince
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
kissed
his
hair
with
an
expression
of
despair
which
struck
vendramin
and
the
frenchman
the
only
two
who
had
their
wits
about
them
then
she
vanished
into
her
room
emilio
seeing
genovese
leave
the
table
while
cataneo
and
capraja
were
absorbed
in
a
long
musical
discussion
stole
to
the
door
of
the
bedroom
lifted
the
curtain
and
slipped
in
like
an
eel
into
the
mud
but
you
see
cataneo
said
capraja
you
have
exacted
the
last
drop
of
physical
enjoyment
and
there
you
are
hanging
on
a
wire
like
a
cardboard
harlequin
patterned
with
scars
and
never
moving
unless
the
string
is
pulled
of
a
perfect
and
you
capraja
who
have
squeezed
ideas
dry
are
not
you
in
the
same
predicament
do
you
not
live
riding
the
hobby
of
a
i
i
possess
the
whole
world
cried
capraja
with
a
sovereign
gesture
of
his
hand
and
i
have
devoured
it
replied
the
duke
they
observed
that
the
physician
and
vendramin
were
gone
and
that
they
were
alone
next
morning
after
a
night
of
perfect
happiness
the
prince
s
sleep
was
disturbed
by
a
dream
he
felt
on
his
heart
the
trickle
of
pearls
dropped
there
by
an
angel
he
woke
and
found
himself
bathed
in
the
tears
of
massimilla
doni
he
was
lying
in
her
arms
and
she
gazed
at
him
as
he
slept
that
evening
at
the
though
la
tinti
had
not
allowed
him
to
rise
till
two
in
the
afternoon
which
is
said
to
be
very
bad
for
a
tenor
voice
genovese
sang
divinely
in
his
part
in
he
was
recalled
with
la
tinti
fresh
crowns
were
given
the
pit
was
wild
with
delight
the
tenor
no
longer
attempted
to
charm
the
prima
donna
by
angelic
methods
vendramin
was
the
only
person
whom
the
doctor
could
not
cure
love
for
a
country
that
has
ceased
to
be
is
a
love
beyond
curing
the
young
venetian
by
dint
of
living
in
his
thirteenth
century
republic
and
in
the
arms
of
that
pernicious
courtesan
called
opium
when
he
found
himself
in
the
world
to
which
reaction
brought
him
succumbed
pitied
and
regretted
by
his
friends
no
how
shall
the
end
of
this
adventure
be
told
for
it
is
too
disastrously
domestic
a
word
will
be
enough
