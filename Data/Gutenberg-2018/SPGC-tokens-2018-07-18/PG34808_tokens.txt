with

swaying
to
and
fro
i
saw
an
immense
the
swiss
family
robinson
chapter
i
shipwrecked
for
many
days
we
had
been
six
times
had
the
darkness
closed
over
a
wild
and
terrific
scene
and
returning
light
as
often
brought
but
renewed
distress
for
the
raging
storm
increased
in
fury
until
on
the
seventh
day
all
hope
was
lost
we
were
driven
completely
out
of
our
course
no
conjecture
could
be
formed
as
to
our
whereabouts
the
crew
had
lost
heart
and
were
utterly
exhausted
by
incessant
labor
the
riven
masts
had
gone
by
the
board
leaks
had
been
sprung
in
every
direction
and
the
water
which
rushed
in
gained
upon
us
rapidly
instead
of
reckless
oaths
the
seamen
now
uttered
frantic
cries
to
god
for
mercy
mingled
with
strange
and
often
ludicrous
vows
to
be
performed
should
deliverance
be
granted
every
man
on
board
alternately
commended
his
soul
to
his
creator
and
strove
to
bethink
himself
of
some
means
of
saving
his
life
my
heart
sank
as
i
looked
round
upon
my
family
in
the
midst
of
these
horrors
our
four
young
sons
were
overpowered
by
terror
dear
children
said
i
if
the
lord
will
he
can
save
us
even
from
this
fearful
peril
if
not
let
us
calmly
yield
our
lives
into
his
hand
and
think
of
the
joy
and
blessedness
of
finding
ourselves
forever
and
ever
united
in
that
happy
home
above
at
these
words
my
weeping
wife
looked
bravely
up
and
as
the
boys
clustered
round
her
she
began
to
cheer
and
encourage
them
with
calm
and
loving
words
i
rejoiced
to
see
her
fortitude
though
my
heart
was
ready
to
break
as
i
gazed
on
my
dear
ones
we
knelt
down
together
one
after
another
praying
with
deep
earnestness
and
emotion
fritz
in
particular
besought
help
and
deliverance
for
his
dear
parents
and
brothers
as
though
quite
forgetting
himself
our
hearts
were
soothed
by
the
comfort
of
confiding
prayer
and
the
horror
of
our
situation
seemed
less
overwhelming
ah
thought
i
the
lord
will
hear
our
prayer
he
will
help
us
amid
the
roar
of
the
thundering
waves
i
suddenly
heard
the
cry
of
land
land
while
at
the
same
instant
the
ship
struck
with
a
frightful
shock
which
threw
everyone
to
the
deck
and
seemed
to
threaten
her
immediate
destruction
dreadful
sounds
betokened
the
breaking
up
of
the
ship
and
the
roaring
waters
poured
in
on
all
sides
then
the
voice
of
the
captain
was
heard
above
the
tumult
shouting
lower
away
the
boats
we
are
lost
lost
i
exclaimed
and
the
word
went
like
a
dagger
to
my
heart
but
seeing
my
children
terror
renewed
i
composed
myself
calling
out
cheerfully
take
courage
my
boys
we
are
all
above
water
yet
there
is
the
land
not
far
off
let
us
do
our
best
to
reach
it
you
know
god
helps
those
that
help
themselves
with
that
i
left
them
and
went
on
deck
what
was
my
horror
when
through
the
foam
and
spray
i
beheld
the
only
remaining
boat
leave
the
ship
the
last
of
the
seamen
spring
into
her
and
push
off
regardless
of
my
cries
and
entreaties
that
we
might
be
allowed
to
share
their
slender
chance
of
preserving
their
lives
my
voice
was
drowned
in
the
howling
of
the
blast
and
even
had
the
crew
wished
it
the
return
of
the
boat
was
impossible
casting
my
eyes
despairingly
around
i
became
gradually
aware
that
our
position
was
by
no
means
hopeless
inasmuch
as
the
stern
of
the
ship
containing
our
cabin
was
jammed
between
two
high
rocks
and
was
partly
raised
from
among
the
breakers
which
dashed
the
forepart
to
pieces
as
the
clouds
of
mist
and
rain
drove
past
i
could
make
out
through
rents
in
the
vaporous
curtain
a
line
of
rocky
coast
and
rugged
as
it
was
my
heart
bounded
toward
it
as
a
sign
of
help
in
the
hour
of
need
yet
the
sense
of
our
lonely
and
forsaken
condition
weighed
heavily
upon
me
as
i
returned
to
my
family
constraining
myself
to
say
with
a
smile
courage
dear
ones
although
our
good
ship
will
never
sail
more
she
is
so
placed
that
our
cabin
will
remain
above
water
and
if
the
wind
and
waves
abate
i
see
no
reason
why
we
should
not
be
able
to
get
ashore
these
few
words
had
an
immediate
effect
on
the
spirits
of
my
children
who
at
once
regarded
our
problematical
chance
of
escaping
as
a
happy
certainty
and
began
to
enjoy
the
relief
from
the
violent
pitching
and
rolling
of
the
vessel
my
wife
however
perceived
my
distress
and
anxiety
in
spite
of
my
forced
composure
and
i
made
her
comprehend
our
real
situation
greatly
fearing
the
effect
of
the
intelligence
on
her
nerves
not
for
a
moment
did
her
courage
and
trust
in
providence
forsake
her
and
on
seeing
this
my
fortitude
revived
we
must
find
some
food
and
take
a
good
supper
said
she
it
will
never
do
to
grow
faint
by
fasting
too
long
we
shall
require
our
utmost
strength
night
drew
on
apace
the
storm
was
as
fierce
as
ever
and
at
intervals
we
were
startled
by
crashes
announcing
further
damage
to
our
unfortunate
ship
god
will
help
us
soon
now
wo
he
father
said
my
youngest
child
you
silly
little
thing
said
fritz
my
eldest
son
sharply
do
you
know
that
we
must
not
settle
what
god
is
to
do
for
us
we
must
have
patience
and
wait
his
time
very
well
said
had
it
been
said
kindly
fritz
my
boy
you
too
often
speak
harshly
to
your
brothers
although
you
may
not
mean
to
do
so
a
good
meal
being
now
ready
my
youngsters
ate
heartily
and
retiring
to
rest
were
speedily
fast
asleep
fritz
who
was
of
an
age
to
be
aware
of
the
real
danger
we
were
in
kept
watch
with
us
after
a
long
silence
father
said
he
do
you
think
we
might
contrive
swimming
belts
for
mother
and
the
boys
with
those
we
might
all
escape
to
land
for
you
and
i
can
swim
your
idea
is
so
good
answered
i
that
i
shall
arrange
something
at
once
in
case
of
an
accident
during
the
night
we
immediately
searched
about
for
what
would
answer
the
purpose
and
fortunately
got
hold
of
a
number
of
empty
flasks
and
tin
canisters
which
we
connected
two
and
two
together
so
as
to
form
floats
sufficiently
buoyant
to
support
a
person
in
the
water
and
my
wife
and
young
sons
each
willingly
put
one
on
i
then
provided
myself
with
matches
knives
cord
and
other
portable
articles
trusting
that
should
the
vessel
go
to
pieces
before
daylight
we
might
gain
the
shore
not
wholly
destitute
fritz
as
well
as
his
brothers
now
slept
soundly
throughout
the
night
my
wife
and
i
maintained
our
prayerful
watch
dreading
at
every
fresh
sound
some
fatal
change
in
the
position
of
the
wreck
at
length
the
faint
dawn
of
day
appeared
the
long
weary
night
was
over
and
with
thankful
hearts
we
perceived
that
the
gale
had
begun
to
moderate
blue
sky
was
seen
above
us
and
the
lovely
hues
of
sunrise
adorned
the
eastern
horizon
i
aroused
the
boys
and
we
assembled
on
the
remaining
portion
of
the
deck
when
they
to
their
surprise
discovered
that
no
one
else
was
on
board
hallo
papa
what
has
become
of
everybody
are
the
sailors
gone
have
they
taken
away
the
boats
oh
papa
why
did
they
leave
us
behind
what
can
we
do
by
ourselves
my
good
children
i
replied
we
must
not
despair
although
we
seem
deserted
see
how
those
on
whose
skill
and
good
faith
we
depended
have
left
us
cruelly
to
our
fate
in
the
hour
of
danger
god
will
never
do
so
he
has
not
forsaken
us
and
we
will
trust
him
still
only
let
us
bestir
ourselves
and
each
cheerily
do
his
best
who
has
anything
to
propose
the
sea
will
soon
be
calm
enough
for
swimming
said
fritz
and
that
would
be
all
very
fine
for
you
exclaimed
ernest
but
think
of
mother
and
the
rest
of
us
why
not
build
a
raft
and
all
get
on
shore
together
we
should
find
it
difficult
i
think
to
make
a
raft
that
would
carry
us
safe
to
shore
however
we
must
contrive
something
and
first
let
each
try
to
procure
what
will
be
of
most
use
to
us
away
we
all
went
to
see
what
was
to
be
found
i
myself
proceeding
to
examine
as
of
great
consequence
the
supplies
of
provisions
and
fresh
water
within
our
reach
my
wife
took
her
youngest
son
franz
to
help
her
to
feed
the
unfortunate
animals
on
board
who
were
in
a
pitiful
plight
having
been
neglected
for
several
days
fritz
hastened
to
the
arm
chest
ernest
to
look
for
tools
and
jack
went
toward
the
captain
cabin
the
door
of
which
he
no
sooner
opened
than
out
sprang
two
splendid
large
dogs
who
testified
their
extreme
delight
and
gratitude
by
such
tremendous
bounds
that
they
knocked
their
little
deliverer
completely
head
over
heels
frightening
him
nearly
out
of
his
wits
jack
did
not
long
yield
either
to
fear
or
to
anger
he
presently
recovered
himself
the
dogs
seemed
to
ask
pardon
by
vehemently
licking
his
face
and
hands
and
so
seizing
the
larger
by
the
ears
he
jumped
on
his
back
and
to
my
great
amusement
coolly
rode
to
meet
me
as
i
came
up
the
hatchway
when
we
in
the
cabin
we
all
displayed
our
treasures
fritz
brought
a
couple
of
guns
shot
belt
powder
flasks
and
plenty
of
bullets
ernest
produced
a
cap
full
of
nails
an
ax
and
a
hammer
while
pincers
chisels
and
augers
stuck
out
of
all
his
pockets
little
franz
carried
a
box
and
eagerly
began
to
show
us
the
nice
sharp
little
hooks
it
contained
well
done
franz
cried
i
these
fish
hooks
which
you
the
youngest
have
found
may
contribute
more
than
anything
else
in
the
ship
to
save
our
lives
by
procuring
food
for
us
fritz
and
ernest
you
have
chosen
well
will
you
praise
me
too
said
my
dear
wife
i
have
nothing
to
show
but
i
can
give
you
good
news
some
useful
animals
are
still
alive
a
cow
a
donkey
two
goats
six
sheep
a
ram
and
a
fine
sow
i
was
but
just
in
time
to
save
their
lives
by
taking
food
to
them
all
these
things
are
excellent
indeed
said
i
but
my
friend
jack
here
has
presented
me
with
a
couple
of
huge
hungry
useless
dogs
who
will
eat
more
than
any
of
us
oh
papa
they
will
be
of
use
why
they
will
help
us
to
hunt
when
we
get
on
shore
no
doubt
they
will
if
ever
we
do
get
on
shore
jack
but
i
must
say
i
do
know
how
it
is
to
be
done
ca
we
each
get
into
a
big
tub
and
float
there
returned
he
i
have
often
sailed
splendidly
like
that
round
the
pond
at
home
my
child
you
have
hit
on
a
capital
idea
cried
i
now
ernest
let
me
have
your
tools
hammers
nails
saws
augers
and
all
and
then
make
haste
to
collect
any
tubs
you
can
find
we
very
soon
found
four
large
casks
made
of
sound
wood
and
strongly
bound
with
iron
hoops
they
were
floating
with
many
other
things
in
the
water
in
the
hold
but
we
managed
to
fish
them
out
and
drag
them
to
a
suitable
place
for
launching
them
they
were
exactly
what
i
wanted
and
i
succeeded
in
sawing
them
across
the
middle
hard
work
it
was
and
we
were
glad
enough
to
stop
and
refresh
ourselves
with
wine
and
biscuits
my
eight
tubs
now
stood
ranged
in
a
row
near
the
water
edge
and
i
looked
at
them
with
great
satisfaction
to
my
surprise
my
wife
did
not
seem
to
share
my
pleasure
i
shall
never
said
she
muster
courage
to
get
into
one
of
these
do
not
be
too
sure
of
that
dear
wife
when
you
see
my
contrivance
completed
you
will
perhaps
prefer
it
to
this
immovable
wreck
i
next
procured
a
long
thin
plank
on
which
my
tubs
could
be
fixed
and
the
two
ends
of
this
i
bent
upward
so
as
to
form
a
keel
two
other
planks
were
nailed
along
the
sides
of
the
tubs
they
also
being
flexible
were
brought
to
a
point
at
each
end
and
all
firmly
secured
and
nailed
together
i
felt
satisfied
that
in
smooth
water
this
craft
would
be
perfectly
trustworthy
but
when
we
thought
all
was
ready
for
the
launch
we
found
to
our
dismay
that
the
grand
contrivance
was
so
heavy
and
clumsy
that
even
our
united
efforts
could
not
move
it
an
inch
i
must
have
a
lever
cried
i
run
and
fetch
the
capstan
bar
fritz
quickly
brought
one
and
having
formed
rollers
by
cutting
up
a
long
spar
i
raised
the
forepart
of
my
boat
with
the
bar
and
my
sons
placed
a
roller
under
it
how
is
it
father
inquired
ernest
that
with
that
thing
you
alone
can
do
more
than
all
of
us
together
i
explained
as
well
as
i
could
in
a
hurry
the
principle
of
the
lever
and
promised
to
have
a
long
talk
on
the
subject
of
mechanics
should
we
have
a
future
opportunity
i
now
made
fast
a
long
rope
to
the
stern
of
our
boat
attaching
the
other
end
to
a
beam
then
placing
a
second
and
third
roller
under
it
we
once
more
began
to
push
this
time
with
success
and
soon
our
gallant
craft
was
safely
launched
so
swiftly
indeed
did
she
glide
into
the
water
that
but
for
the
rope
she
would
have
passed
beyond
our
reach
the
boys
wished
to
jump
in
directly
but
alas
she
leaned
so
much
on
one
side
that
they
could
not
venture
to
do
so
some
heavy
things
being
thrown
in
however
the
boat
righted
itself
by
degrees
and
the
boys
were
so
delighted
that
they
struggled
which
should
first
leap
in
to
have
the
fun
of
sitting
down
in
the
tubs
but
it
was
plain
to
me
at
once
that
something
more
was
required
to
make
her
perfectly
safe
so
i
contrived
to
preserve
the
balance
by
nailing
long
poles
across
at
the
stem
and
stern
and
fixing
at
the
ends
of
each
empty
brandy
casks
then
the
boat
appearing
steady
i
got
in
and
turning
it
toward
the
most
open
side
of
the
wreck
i
cut
and
cleared
away
obstructions
so
as
to
leave
a
free
passage
for
our
departure
and
the
boys
brought
oars
to
be
ready
for
the
voyage
this
important
undertaking
we
were
forced
to
postpone
until
the
next
day
as
it
was
by
this
time
far
too
late
to
attempt
it
it
was
not
pleasant
to
have
to
spend
another
night
in
so
precarious
a
situation
but
yielding
to
necessity
we
sat
down
to
enjoy
a
comfortable
supper
for
during
our
exciting
and
incessant
work
all
day
we
had
taken
nothing
but
an
occasional
biscuit
and
a
little
wine
we
prepared
for
rest
in
a
much
happier
frame
of
mind
than
on
the
preceding
day
but
i
did
not
forget
the
possibility
of
a
renewed
storm
and
therefore
made
every
one
put
on
the
belts
as
before
i
persuaded
my
wife
not
without
considerable
difficulty
to
put
on
a
sailor
dress
assuring
her
she
would
find
it
much
more
comfortable
and
convenient
for
all
she
would
have
to
go
through
she
at
last
consented
to
do
this
and
left
us
for
a
short
time
reappearing
with
much
embarrassment
and
many
blushes
in
a
most
becoming
suit
which
she
had
found
in
a
midshipman
chest
we
all
admired
her
costume
and
any
awkwardness
she
felt
soon
began
to
pass
off
then
retiring
to
our
berths
peaceful
sleep
prepared
us
all
for
the
exertions
of
the
coming
day
we
rose
up
betimes
for
sleep
weighs
lightly
on
the
hopeful
as
well
as
on
the
anxious
after
kneeling
together
in
prayer
now
my
beloved
ones
said
i
with
god
help
we
are
about
to
effect
our
escape
let
the
poor
animals
we
must
leave
behind
be
well
fed
and
put
plenty
of
fodder
within
their
reach
in
a
few
days
we
may
be
able
to
return
and
save
them
likewise
after
that
collect
everything
you
can
think
of
which
may
be
of
use
to
us
the
boys
joyfully
obeyed
me
and
i
selected
from
the
large
quantity
of
stores
they
got
together
canvas
to
make
a
tent
a
chest
of
tools
guns
pistols
powder
shot
and
bullets
rods
and
fishing
tackle
an
iron
pot
a
case
of
portable
soup
and
another
of
biscuit
these
useful
articles
of
course
took
the
place
of
the
ballast
i
had
hastily
thrown
in
the
day
before
with
a
hearty
prayer
for
god
blessing
we
now
began
to
take
our
seats
each
in
his
tub
just
then
we
heard
the
cocks
begin
to
crow
as
though
to
reproach
us
for
deserting
them
why
should
not
the
fowls
go
with
us
exclaimed
i
if
we
find
no
food
for
them
they
can
be
food
for
us
ten
hens
and
a
couple
of
cocks
were
accordingly
placed
in
one
of
the
tubs
and
secured
with
some
over
them
the
ducks
and
geese
were
set
at
liberty
and
took
to
the
water
at
once
while
the
pigeons
rejoicing
to
find
themselves
on
the
wing
swiftly
made
for
the
shore
my
wife
who
managed
all
this
for
me
kept
us
waiting
for
her
some
little
time
and
came
at
last
with
a
bag
as
big
as
a
pillow
in
her
arms
this
is
my
contribution
said
she
throwing
the
bag
to
little
franz
to
be
as
i
thought
a
cushion
for
him
to
sit
upon
all
being
ready
we
cast
off
and
moved
away
from
the
wreck
my
good
brave
wife
sat
in
the
first
compartment
of
the
boat
next
her
was
franz
a
pretty
little
boy
nearly
eight
years
old
then
came
fritz
a
handsome
spirited
young
fellow
of
fifteen
the
two
center
tubs
contained
the
valuable
cargo
then
came
our
bold
thoughtless
jack
next
him
ernest
my
second
son
intelligent
and
rather
indolent
i
myself
the
anxious
loving
father
stood
in
the
stern
endeavoring
to
guide
the
raft
with
its
precious
burden
to
a
safe
the
elder
boys
took
the
oars
everyone
wore
a
float
belt
and
had
something
useful
close
to
him
in
case
of
being
thrown
into
the
water
the
tide
was
flowing
which
was
a
great
help
to
the
young
oarsmen
we
emerged
from
the
wreck
and
glided
into
the
open
sea
all
eyes
were
strained
to
get
a
full
view
of
the
land
and
the
boys
pulled
with
a
will
but
for
some
time
we
made
no
progress
as
the
boat
kept
turning
round
and
round
until
i
hit
upon
the
right
way
to
steer
it
after
which
we
merrily
made
for
the
shore
we
had
left
the
two
dogs
turk
and
juno
on
the
wreck
as
being
both
large
mastiffs
we
did
not
care
to
have
their
additional
weight
on
board
our
craft
but
when
they
saw
us
apparently
deserting
them
they
set
up
a
piteous
howl
and
sprang
into
the
sea
i
was
sorry
to
see
this
for
the
distance
to
the
land
was
so
great
that
i
scarcely
expected
them
to
be
able
to
accomplish
it
they
followed
us
however
and
occasionally
resting
their
forepaws
on
the
kept
up
with
us
well
jack
was
inclined
to
deny
them
this
their
only
chance
to
safety
stop
said
i
that
would
be
unkind
as
well
as
foolish
remember
the
merciful
man
regardeth
the
life
of
his
beast
our
passage
though
tedious
was
safe
but
the
nearer
we
approached
the
shore
the
less
inviting
it
appeared
the
barren
rocks
seemed
to
threaten
us
with
misery
and
want
many
casks
boxes
and
bales
of
goods
floated
on
the
water
around
us
fritz
and
i
managed
to
secure
a
couple
of
hogsheads
so
as
to
tow
them
alongside
with
the
prospect
of
famine
before
us
it
was
desirable
to
lay
hold
of
anything
likely
to
contain
provisions
by
and
by
we
began
to
perceive
that
between
and
beyond
the
cliffs
green
grass
and
trees
were
discernible
fritz
could
distinguish
many
tall
palms
and
ernest
hoped
they
would
prove
to
be
cocoanut
trees
and
enjoyed
the
thoughts
of
drinking
the
refreshing
milk
i
am
very
sorry
i
never
thought
of
bringing
away
the
telescope
said
i
oh
look
here
father
cried
jack
drawing
a
little
spyglass
joyfully
out
of
his
pocket
by
means
of
this
glass
i
made
out
that
at
some
distance
to
the
left
the
coast
was
much
more
inviting
a
strong
current
however
carried
us
directly
toward
the
frowning
rocks
but
i
presently
observed
an
opening
where
a
stream
flowed
into
the
sea
and
saw
that
our
geese
and
ducks
were
swimming
toward
this
place
i
steered
after
them
into
the
creek
and
we
found
ourselves
in
a
small
bay
or
inlet
where
the
water
was
perfectly
smooth
and
of
moderate
depth
the
ground
sloped
gently
upward
from
the
low
banks
of
the
cliffs
which
here
retired
inland
leaving
a
small
plain
on
which
it
was
easy
for
us
to
land
everyone
sprang
gladly
out
of
the
boat
but
little
franz
who
lying
packed
in
his
tub
like
a
potted
shrimp
had
to
be
lifted
out
by
his
mother
the
dogs
had
scrambled
on
shore
before
us
they
received
us
with
loud
barking
and
the
wildest
demonstrations
of
delight
the
geese
and
ducks
kept
up
an
incessant
din
added
to
which
was
the
screaming
and
croaking
of
flamingoes
and
penguins
whose
dominion
we
were
invading
the
noise
was
deafening
but
far
from
unwelcome
to
me
as
i
thought
of
the
good
dinners
the
birds
might
furnish
as
soon
as
we
could
gather
our
children
around
us
on
dry
land
we
knelt
to
offer
thanks
and
praise
for
our
merciful
escape
and
with
full
hearts
we
commended
ourselves
to
god
good
keeping
for
the
time
to
come
all
hands
then
briskly
fell
to
the
work
of
unloading
and
oh
how
rich
we
felt
ourselves
as
we
did
so
the
poultry
we
left
at
liberty
to
forage
for
themselves
and
set
about
finding
a
suitable
place
to
erect
a
tent
in
which
to
pass
the
night
this
we
speedily
did
thrusting
a
long
spar
into
a
hole
in
the
rock
and
supporting
the
other
end
by
a
pole
firmly
planted
in
the
ground
we
formed
a
framework
over
which
we
stretched
the
sailcloth
we
had
brought
besides
fastening
this
down
with
pegs
we
placed
our
heavy
chests
and
boxes
on
the
border
of
the
canvas
and
arranged
hooks
so
as
to
be
able
to
close
up
the
entrance
during
the
night
when
this
was
accomplished
the
boys
ran
to
collect
moss
and
grass
to
spread
in
the
tent
for
our
beds
while
i
arranged
a
fireplace
with
some
large
flat
stones
near
the
brook
which
flowed
close
by
dry
twigs
and
seaweed
were
soon
in
a
blaze
on
the
hearth
i
filled
the
iron
pot
with
water
and
giving
my
wife
several
cakes
of
the
portable
soup
she
established
herself
as
our
cook
with
little
franz
to
help
her
he
thinking
his
mother
was
melting
some
glue
for
carpentering
was
eager
to
know
what
papa
was
going
to
make
next
this
is
to
be
soup
for
your
dinner
my
child
do
you
think
these
cakes
look
like
glue
yes
indeed
i
do
replied
franz
and
i
should
not
much
like
to
taste
glue
soup
do
you
want
some
beef
or
mutton
mamma
where
can
i
get
it
dear
said
she
we
are
a
long
way
from
a
butcher
shop
but
these
cakes
are
made
of
the
juice
of
good
meat
boiled
till
it
becomes
a
strong
stiff
jelly
people
take
them
when
they
go
to
sea
because
on
a
long
voyage
they
can
only
have
salt
meat
which
will
not
make
nice
soup
fritz
meanwhile
leaving
a
loaded
gun
with
me
took
another
himself
and
went
along
the
rough
coast
to
see
what
lay
beyond
the
stream
this
fatiguing
sort
of
walk
not
suiting
ernest
fancy
he
sauntered
down
to
the
beach
and
jack
scrambled
among
the
rocks
searching
for
i
was
anxious
to
land
the
two
casks
which
were
floating
alongside
our
boat
but
on
attempting
to
do
so
i
found
that
i
could
not
get
them
up
the
bank
on
which
we
had
landed
and
was
therefore
obliged
to
look
for
a
more
convenient
spot
as
i
did
so
i
was
startled
by
hearing
jack
shouting
for
help
as
though
in
great
danger
he
was
at
some
distance
and
i
hurried
toward
him
with
a
hatchet
in
my
hand
the
little
fellow
stood
screaming
in
a
deep
pool
and
as
i
approached
i
saw
that
a
huge
lobster
had
caught
his
leg
in
its
powerful
claw
poor
jack
was
in
a
terrible
fright
kick
as
he
would
his
enemy
still
clung
on
i
waded
into
the
water
and
seizing
the
lobster
firmly
by
the
back
managed
to
make
it
loosen
its
hold
and
we
brought
it
safe
to
land
jack
having
speedily
recovered
his
spirits
and
anxious
to
take
such
a
prize
to
his
mother
caught
the
lobster
in
both
hands
but
instantly
received
such
a
severe
blow
from
its
tail
that
he
flung
it
down
and
passionately
hit
the
creature
with
a
large
stone
this
display
of
temper
vexed
me
you
are
acting
in
a
very
childish
way
my
son
said
i
never
strike
an
enemy
in
a
revengeful
spirit
once
more
lifting
the
lobster
jack
ran
triumphantly
toward
the
tent
mother
mother
a
lobster
a
lobster
ernest
look
here
franz
mind
he
bite
you
where
fritz
all
came
crowding
round
jack
and
his
prize
wondering
at
its
unusual
size
and
ernest
wanted
his
mother
to
make
lobster
soup
directly
by
adding
it
to
what
she
was
now
boiling
she
however
begged
to
decline
making
any
such
experiment
and
said
she
preferred
cooking
one
dish
at
a
time
having
remarked
that
the
scene
of
jack
adventure
afforded
a
convenient
place
for
getting
my
casks
on
shore
i
returned
thither
and
succeeded
in
drawing
them
up
on
the
beach
where
i
set
them
on
end
and
for
the
present
left
them
on
my
return
i
resumed
the
subject
of
jack
lobster
and
told
him
he
should
have
the
offending
claw
all
to
himself
when
it
was
ready
to
be
eaten
congratulating
him
on
being
the
first
to
discover
anything
useful
as
to
that
said
ernest
i
found
something
very
good
to
eat
as
well
as
jack
only
i
could
not
get
at
them
without
wetting
my
feet
pooh
cried
jack
i
know
what
he
saw
nothing
but
some
nasty
mussels
i
saw
them
too
who
wants
to
eat
trash
like
that
lobster
for
me
i
believe
them
to
be
oysters
not
mussels
returned
ernest
calmly
be
good
enough
my
philosophical
young
friend
to
fetch
a
few
specimens
of
these
oysters
in
time
for
our
next
meal
said
i
we
must
all
exert
ourselves
ernest
for
the
common
good
and
pray
never
let
me
hear
you
object
to
wetting
your
feet
see
how
quickly
the
sun
has
dried
jack
and
me
i
can
bring
some
salt
at
the
same
time
said
ernest
i
remarked
a
good
deal
lying
in
the
crevices
of
the
rocks
it
tasted
very
pure
and
good
and
i
concluded
it
was
produced
by
the
evaporation
of
sea
water
in
the
sun
extremely
probable
learned
sir
cried
i
but
if
you
had
brought
a
bagful
of
this
good
salt
instead
of
merely
speculating
so
profoundly
on
the
subject
it
would
have
been
more
to
the
purpose
run
and
fetch
some
directly
it
proved
to
be
salt
sure
enough
although
so
impure
that
it
seemed
useless
till
my
wife
dissolved
and
strained
it
when
it
became
fit
to
put
in
the
soup
why
not
use
the
sea
water
itself
asked
jack
because
said
ernest
it
is
not
only
salt
but
bitter
too
just
try
it
now
said
my
wife
tasting
the
soup
with
the
stick
with
which
she
had
been
stirring
it
dinner
is
ready
but
where
can
fritz
be
she
continued
a
little
anxiously
how
are
we
to
eat
our
soup
when
he
does
come
i
asked
we
have
neither
plates
nor
spoons
and
we
can
scarcely
lift
the
boiling
pot
to
our
mouths
we
are
in
as
uncomfortable
a
position
as
was
the
fox
to
whom
the
stork
served
up
a
dinner
in
a
jug
with
a
long
neck
oh
for
a
few
cocoanut
shells
sighed
ernest
oh
for
half
a
dozen
plates
and
as
many
silver
spoons
rejoined
i
smiling
really
though
would
do
said
he
after
a
thought
true
that
is
an
idea
worth
having
off
with
you
my
boys
get
the
oysters
and
clean
out
a
few
shells
what
though
our
spoons
have
no
handles
and
we
do
burn
our
fingers
a
little
in
baling
the
soup
out
jack
was
away
and
up
to
his
knees
in
the
water
in
a
moment
detaching
the
oysters
ernest
followed
more
leisurely
and
still
unwilling
to
wet
his
feet
stood
by
the
margin
of
the
pool
and
gathered
in
his
handkerchief
the
oysters
his
brother
threw
him
as
he
thus
stood
he
picked
up
and
pocketed
a
large
mussel
shell
for
his
own
use
as
they
returned
with
a
good
supply
we
heard
a
shout
from
fritz
in
the
distance
we
returned
it
joyfully
and
he
presently
appeared
before
us
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
a
look
of
disappointment
upon
his
countenance
unsuccessful
said
he
really
i
replied
never
mind
my
boy
better
luck
next
time
oh
fritz
exclaimed
his
brothers
who
had
looked
behind
him
a
a
little
where
did
you
get
it
how
did
you
shoot
it
do
let
us
see
it
fritz
then
with
sparkling
eyes
exhibited
his
prize
i
am
glad
to
see
the
result
of
your
prowess
my
boy
said
i
but
i
can
not
approve
of
deceit
even
as
a
joke
stick
to
the
truth
in
jest
and
earnest
fritz
then
told
us
how
he
had
been
to
the
other
side
of
the
stream
so
different
from
this
he
said
it
is
really
a
beautiful
country
and
the
shore
which
runs
down
to
the
sea
in
a
gentle
slope
is
covered
with
all
sorts
of
useful
things
from
the
wreck
do
let
us
go
and
collect
them
and
father
why
should
we
not
return
to
the
wreck
and
bring
off
some
of
the
animals
just
think
of
what
value
the
cow
would
be
to
us
and
what
a
pity
it
would
be
to
lose
her
let
us
get
her
on
shore
and
we
will
move
over
the
stream
where
she
will
have
good
pasturage
and
we
shall
be
in
the
shade
instead
of
on
this
desert
and
father
i
do
wish
stop
stop
my
boy
cried
i
all
will
be
done
in
good
time
and
the
day
after
will
bring
work
of
their
own
and
tell
me
did
you
see
no
traces
of
our
shipmates
not
a
sign
of
them
either
on
land
or
sea
living
or
dead
he
replied
but
the
said
jack
where
did
you
get
it
it
was
one
of
several
said
fritz
which
i
found
on
the
shore
most
curious
animals
they
are
they
hopped
rather
than
walked
and
every
now
and
then
would
squat
down
on
their
legs
and
rub
their
snouts
with
their
forepaws
had
not
i
been
afraid
of
losing
them
all
i
would
have
tried
to
catch
one
alive
they
seemed
so
tame
meanwhile
ernest
had
been
carefully
examining
the
animal
in
question
this
is
no
pig
he
said
and
except
for
its
bristly
skin
does
not
look
like
one
see
its
teeth
are
not
like
those
of
a
pig
but
rather
those
of
a
squirrel
in
fact
he
continued
looking
at
fritz
your
is
an
agouti
dear
me
said
fritz
listen
to
the
great
professor
lecturing
he
is
going
to
prove
that
a
pig
is
not
a
pig
you
need
not
be
so
quick
to
laugh
at
your
brother
said
i
in
my
turn
he
is
quite
right
i
too
know
the
agouti
by
descriptions
and
pictures
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
this
is
a
specimen
the
little
animal
is
a
native
of
north
america
where
it
makes
its
nest
under
the
roots
of
trees
and
lives
upon
fruit
but
ernest
the
agouti
not
only
looks
something
like
a
pig
but
most
decidedly
grunts
like
a
porker
while
we
were
thus
talking
jack
had
been
vainly
endeavoring
to
open
an
oyster
with
his
large
knife
here
is
a
simpler
way
said
i
placing
an
oyster
on
the
fire
it
immediately
opened
now
i
continued
who
will
try
this
delicacy
all
at
first
hesitated
to
partake
of
them
so
unattractive
did
they
appear
jack
however
tightly
closing
his
eyes
and
making
a
face
as
though
about
to
take
medicine
gulped
one
down
we
followed
his
example
one
after
the
other
each
doing
so
rather
to
provide
himself
with
a
spoon
than
with
any
hope
of
cultivating
a
taste
for
oysters
our
spoons
were
now
ready
and
gathering
round
the
pot
we
dipped
them
in
not
however
without
sundry
scalded
fingers
ernest
then
drew
from
his
pocket
the
large
shell
he
had
procured
for
his
own
use
and
scooping
up
a
good
quantity
of
soup
he
put
it
down
to
cool
smiling
at
his
own
foresight
prudence
should
be
exercised
for
others
i
remarked
your
cool
soup
will
do
capitally
for
the
dogs
my
boy
take
it
to
them
and
then
come
and
eat
like
the
rest
of
us
ernest
winced
at
this
but
silently
taking
up
his
shell
he
placed
it
on
the
ground
before
the
hungry
dogs
who
lapped
up
its
contents
in
a
moment
he
then
returned
and
we
all
went
merrily
on
with
our
dinner
while
we
were
thus
busily
employed
we
suddenly
discovered
that
our
dogs
not
satisfied
with
their
mouthful
of
soup
had
espied
the
agouti
and
were
rapidly
devouring
it
fritz
seizing
his
gun
flew
to
rescue
it
from
their
hungry
jaws
and
before
i
could
prevent
him
struck
one
of
them
with
such
force
that
his
gun
was
bent
the
poor
beasts
ran
off
howling
followed
by
a
shower
of
stones
from
fritz
who
shouted
and
yelled
at
them
so
fiercely
that
his
mother
was
actually
terrified
i
followed
him
and
as
soon
as
he
would
listen
to
me
represented
to
him
how
despicable
as
well
as
wicked
was
such
an
outbreak
of
temper
for
said
i
you
have
hurt
if
not
actually
wounded
the
dogs
you
have
distressed
and
terrified
your
mother
and
spoiled
your
gun
though
fritz
passion
was
easily
aroused
it
never
lasted
long
and
speedily
recovering
himself
immediately
he
entreated
his
pardon
and
expressed
his
sorrow
for
his
fault
by
this
time
the
sun
was
sinking
beneath
the
horizon
and
the
poultry
which
had
been
straying
to
some
little
distance
gathered
round
us
and
began
to
pick
up
the
crumbs
of
biscuit
which
had
fallen
during
our
repast
my
wife
hereupon
drew
from
her
mysterious
bag
some
handfuls
of
oats
peas
and
other
grain
and
with
them
began
to
feed
the
poultry
she
at
the
same
time
showed
me
several
other
seeds
of
various
vegetables
that
was
indeed
thoughtful
said
i
but
pray
be
careful
of
what
will
be
of
such
value
to
us
we
can
bring
plenty
of
damaged
biscuits
from
the
wreck
which
though
of
no
use
as
food
for
us
will
suit
the
fowls
very
well
indeed
the
pigeons
now
flew
up
to
crevices
in
the
rocks
the
fowls
perched
themselves
on
our
tent
pole
and
the
ducks
and
geese
waddled
off
cackling
and
quacking
to
the
marshy
margin
of
the
river
we
too
were
ready
for
repose
and
having
loaded
our
guns
and
offered
up
our
prayers
to
god
thanking
him
for
his
many
mercies
to
us
we
commended
ourselves
to
his
protecting
care
and
as
the
last
ray
of
light
departed
closed
our
tent
and
lay
down
to
rest
the
children
remarked
the
suddenness
of
nightfall
for
indeed
there
had
been
little
or
no
twilight
this
convinced
me
that
we
must
be
not
far
from
the
equator
for
twilight
results
from
the
refraction
of
the
rays
the
more
obliquely
these
rays
fall
the
farther
does
the
partial
light
extend
while
the
more
perpendicularly
they
strike
the
earth
the
longer
do
they
continue
their
undiminished
force
until
when
the
sun
sinks
they
totally
disappear
thus
producing
sudden
darkness
chapter
ii
the
first
exploring
expedition
we
should
have
been
badly
off
without
the
shelter
of
our
tent
for
the
night
proved
as
cold
as
the
day
had
been
hot
but
we
managed
to
sleep
comfortably
everyone
being
thoroughly
fatigued
by
the
labors
of
the
day
the
voice
of
our
vigilant
cock
which
as
he
loudly
saluted
the
rising
moon
was
the
last
sound
i
heard
at
night
roused
me
at
daybreak
and
i
then
awoke
my
wife
that
in
the
quiet
interval
while
yet
our
children
slept
we
might
take
counsel
together
on
our
situation
and
prospects
it
was
plain
to
both
of
us
that
in
the
first
place
we
should
ascertain
if
possible
the
fate
of
our
late
companions
and
then
examine
into
the
nature
and
resources
of
the
country
on
which
we
were
stranded
we
therefore
came
to
the
resolution
that
as
soon
as
we
had
breakfasted
fritz
and
i
should
start
on
an
expedition
with
these
objects
in
view
while
my
wife
remained
near
our
with
the
three
younger
boys
rouse
up
rouse
up
my
boys
cried
i
awakening
the
children
cheerfully
come
and
help
your
mother
to
get
breakfast
ready
as
to
that
said
she
smiling
we
can
but
set
on
the
pot
and
boil
some
more
soup
why
you
forget
jack
fine
lobster
replied
i
what
has
become
of
it
jack
it
has
been
safe
in
this
hole
in
the
rock
all
night
father
you
see
i
thought
as
the
dogs
seem
to
like
good
things
they
might
take
a
fancy
to
that
as
well
as
to
the
agouti
a
very
sensible
precaution
remarked
i
i
believe
even
my
heedless
jack
will
learn
wisdom
in
time
it
is
well
the
lobster
is
so
large
for
we
shall
want
to
take
part
with
us
on
our
excursion
at
the
mention
of
an
excursion
the
four
children
were
wild
with
delight
and
capering
around
me
clapped
their
hands
for
joy
steady
there
steady
said
i
you
can
not
expect
all
to
go
such
an
expedition
as
this
would
be
too
dangerous
and
fatiguing
for
you
younger
ones
fritz
and
i
will
go
alone
this
time
with
one
of
the
dogs
leaving
the
other
to
defend
you
we
then
armed
ourselves
each
taking
a
gun
and
a
game
bag
fritz
in
addition
sticking
a
pair
of
pistols
in
his
belt
and
i
a
small
hatchet
in
mine
breakfast
being
over
we
stowed
away
the
remainder
of
the
lobster
and
some
biscuits
with
a
flask
of
water
and
were
ready
for
a
start
stop
i
exclaimed
we
have
still
left
something
very
important
undone
surely
not
said
fritz
yes
said
i
we
have
not
yet
joined
in
morning
prayer
we
are
only
too
ready
amid
the
cares
and
pleasures
of
this
life
to
forget
the
god
to
whom
we
owe
all
things
then
having
commended
ourselves
to
his
protecting
care
i
took
leave
of
my
wife
and
children
and
bidding
them
not
wander
far
from
the
boat
and
tent
we
parted
not
without
some
anxiety
on
either
side
for
we
knew
not
what
might
assail
us
in
this
unknown
region
we
now
found
that
the
banks
of
the
stream
were
on
both
sides
so
rocky
that
we
could
get
down
to
the
water
by
only
one
narrow
passage
and
there
was
no
corresponding
path
on
the
other
side
i
was
glad
to
see
this
however
for
i
now
knew
that
my
wife
and
children
were
on
a
comparatively
inaccessible
spot
the
other
side
of
the
tent
being
protected
by
steep
and
precipitous
cliffs
fritz
and
i
pursued
our
way
up
the
stream
until
we
reached
a
point
where
the
waters
fell
from
a
considerable
height
in
a
cascade
and
where
several
large
rocks
lay
half
covered
by
the
water
by
means
of
these
we
succeeded
in
crossing
the
stream
in
safety
we
thus
had
the
sea
on
our
left
and
a
long
line
of
rocky
heights
here
and
there
adorned
with
clumps
of
trees
stretching
away
inland
to
the
right
we
had
forced
our
way
scarcely
fifty
yards
through
the
long
rank
grass
which
was
here
partly
withered
by
the
sun
and
much
tangled
when
we
heard
behind
us
a
rustling
and
on
looking
round
saw
the
grass
waving
to
and
fro
as
if
some
animal
were
passing
through
it
fritz
instantly
turned
and
brought
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
ready
to
fire
the
moment
the
beast
should
appear
i
was
much
pleased
with
my
son
coolness
and
presence
of
mind
for
it
showed
me
that
i
might
thoroughly
rely
upon
him
on
any
future
occasion
when
real
danger
might
occur
this
time
however
no
savage
beast
rushed
out
but
our
trusty
dog
turk
whom
in
our
anxiety
at
parting
we
had
forgotten
and
who
had
been
sent
after
us
doubtless
by
my
thoughtful
wife
from
this
little
incident
however
we
saw
how
dangerous
was
our
position
and
how
difficult
escape
would
be
should
any
fierce
beast
steal
upon
us
unawares
we
therefore
hastened
to
make
our
way
to
the
open
seashore
here
the
scene
which
presented
itself
was
indeed
delightful
a
background
of
hills
the
green
waving
grass
the
pleasant
groups
of
trees
stretching
here
and
there
to
the
very
water
edge
formed
a
lovely
prospect
on
the
smooth
sand
we
searched
carefully
for
any
trace
of
our
hapless
companions
but
not
the
mark
of
a
footstep
could
we
find
shall
i
fire
a
shot
or
two
said
fritz
that
would
bring
our
companions
if
they
are
within
hearing
it
would
indeed
i
replied
or
any
savages
that
may
be
here
no
no
let
us
search
diligently
but
as
quietly
as
possible
but
why
father
should
we
trouble
ourselves
about
them
at
all
they
left
us
to
shift
for
ourselves
and
i
for
one
do
care
to
set
eyes
on
them
again
you
are
wrong
my
boy
said
i
in
the
first
place
we
should
not
return
evil
for
evil
then
again
they
might
be
of
great
assistance
to
us
in
building
a
house
of
some
sort
and
lastly
you
must
remember
that
they
took
nothing
with
them
from
the
vessel
and
may
be
perishing
of
hunger
thus
talking
we
pushed
on
until
we
came
to
a
pleasant
grove
which
stretched
down
to
the
water
edge
here
we
halted
to
rest
seating
ourselves
under
a
large
tree
by
a
rivulet
which
murmured
and
splashed
along
its
pebbly
bed
into
the
great
ocean
before
us
a
thousand
birds
flew
twittering
above
us
and
fritz
and
i
gazed
up
at
them
my
son
suddenly
started
up
a
monkey
he
exclaimed
i
am
nearly
sure
i
saw
a
monkey
as
he
spoke
he
sprang
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
tree
and
in
doing
so
stumbled
over
a
round
substance
which
he
handed
to
me
remarking
as
he
did
so
that
it
was
a
round
bird
nest
of
which
he
had
often
heard
you
may
have
done
so
said
i
laughing
but
you
need
not
necessarily
conclude
that
every
round
hairy
thing
is
a
bird
nest
this
for
instance
is
not
one
but
a
cocoanut
we
split
open
the
nut
but
to
our
disgust
found
the
kernel
dry
and
uneatable
hullo
cried
fritz
i
always
thought
a
cocoanut
was
full
of
delicious
sweet
liquid
like
almond
milk
so
it
is
i
replied
when
young
and
fresh
but
as
it
ripens
the
milk
becomes
congealed
and
in
course
of
time
is
solidified
into
a
kernel
this
kernel
then
dries
as
you
see
here
but
when
the
nut
falls
on
favorable
soil
the
germ
within
the
kernel
swells
until
it
bursts
through
the
shell
and
taking
root
springs
up
a
new
tree
i
do
not
understand
said
fritz
how
the
little
germ
manages
to
get
through
this
great
thick
shell
which
is
not
like
an
almond
or
hazel
that
is
divided
down
the
middle
already
nature
provides
for
all
things
i
answered
taking
up
the
pieces
look
here
do
you
see
these
three
round
holes
near
the
stalk
it
is
through
them
that
the
germ
obtains
egress
now
let
us
find
a
good
nut
if
we
can
as
cocoanuts
must
be
before
they
fall
naturally
from
the
tree
it
was
not
without
difficulty
that
we
obtained
one
in
which
the
kernel
was
not
dried
up
when
we
succeeded
however
we
were
so
refreshed
by
the
fruit
that
we
could
defer
the
repast
we
called
our
dinner
until
later
in
the
day
and
so
spare
our
stock
of
provisions
continuing
our
way
through
a
thicket
and
which
was
so
densely
overgrown
with
lianas
that
we
had
to
clear
a
passage
with
our
hatchets
we
again
emerged
on
the
seashore
beyond
and
found
an
open
view
the
forest
sweeping
inland
while
on
the
space
before
us
stood
at
intervals
single
trees
of
remarkable
appearance
these
at
once
attracted
fritz
observant
eye
and
he
pointed
to
them
exclaiming
oh
what
trees
father
see
what
strange
bumps
there
are
on
the
trunks
we
approached
to
examine
them
and
i
recognized
them
as
calabash
trees
the
fruit
of
which
grows
in
this
curious
way
on
the
stems
and
is
a
species
of
gourd
from
the
hard
rind
of
which
bowls
spoons
and
bottles
can
be
made
the
savages
i
remarked
are
said
to
form
these
things
most
ingeniously
using
them
to
contain
liquids
indeed
they
actually
cook
food
in
them
oh
but
that
is
impossible
returned
fritz
i
am
quite
sure
this
rind
would
be
burnt
through
directly
it
was
set
on
the
fire
i
did
not
say
it
was
set
on
the
fire
at
all
when
the
gourd
has
been
divided
in
two
and
the
shell
or
rind
emptied
of
its
contents
it
is
filled
with
water
into
which
the
fish
or
whatever
is
to
be
cooked
is
put
red
hot
stones
are
added
until
the
water
boils
the
food
becomes
fit
to
eat
and
the
remains
uninjured
that
is
a
very
clever
plan
very
simple
too
i
daresay
i
should
have
hit
on
it
if
i
had
tried
said
fritz
the
friends
of
columbus
thought
it
very
easy
to
make
an
egg
stand
upon
its
end
when
he
had
shown
them
how
to
do
it
but
now
suppose
we
prepare
some
of
these
calabashes
that
they
may
be
ready
for
use
when
we
take
them
home
fritz
instantly
took
up
one
of
the
gourds
and
tried
to
split
it
equally
with
his
knife
but
in
vain
the
blade
slipped
and
the
calabash
was
cut
jaggedly
what
a
nuisance
said
fritz
flinging
it
down
the
thing
is
spoiled
and
yet
it
seemed
so
simple
to
divide
it
properly
stay
said
i
you
are
too
impatient
those
pieces
are
not
useless
do
you
try
to
fashion
from
them
a
spoon
or
two
while
i
provide
a
dish
i
then
took
from
my
pocket
a
piece
of
string
which
i
tied
tightly
round
a
gourd
as
near
one
end
of
it
as
i
could
then
tapping
the
string
with
the
back
of
my
knife
it
penetrated
the
outer
shell
when
this
was
accomplished
i
tied
the
string
yet
tighter
and
drawing
the
ends
with
all
my
might
the
gourd
fell
divided
exactly
as
i
wished
that
is
clever
cried
fritz
what
in
the
world
put
that
plan
into
your
head
it
is
a
plan
i
replied
which
the
negroes
adopt
as
i
have
learned
from
reading
books
of
travel
well
it
certainly
makes
a
capital
and
a
too
said
fritz
examining
the
gourd
but
supposing
you
had
wanted
to
make
a
bottle
how
would
you
have
set
to
work
it
would
be
an
easier
operation
than
this
if
possible
all
that
is
necessary
is
to
cut
a
round
hole
at
one
end
then
to
scoop
out
the
interior
and
to
drop
in
several
shot
or
stones
when
these
are
shaken
any
remaining
portions
of
the
fruit
are
detached
and
the
gourd
is
thoroughly
cleaned
and
the
bottle
completed
that
would
not
make
a
very
convenient
bottle
though
father
it
would
be
more
like
a
barrel
true
my
boy
if
you
want
a
more
shapely
vessel
you
must
take
it
in
hand
when
it
is
younger
to
give
it
a
neck
for
instance
you
must
tie
a
bandage
round
the
young
gourd
while
it
is
still
on
the
tree
and
then
all
will
swell
but
that
part
which
you
have
checked
as
i
spoke
i
filled
the
gourds
with
sand
and
left
them
to
dry
marking
the
spot
that
we
might
return
for
them
on
our
way
back
for
three
hours
or
more
we
pushed
forward
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
on
either
side
for
any
trace
of
our
companions
till
we
reached
a
bold
promontory
stretching
some
way
into
the
sea
from
whose
rocky
summit
i
knew
that
we
should
obtain
a
good
and
comprehensive
view
of
the
surrounding
country
with
little
difficulty
we
reached
the
top
but
the
most
careful
survey
of
the
beautiful
landscape
failed
to
show
us
the
slightest
sign
or
trace
of
human
beings
before
us
stretched
a
wide
and
lovely
bay
fringed
with
yellow
sands
either
side
extending
into
the
distance
and
almost
lost
to
view
in
two
shadowy
promontories
inclosed
by
these
two
arms
lay
a
sheet
of
rippling
water
which
reflected
in
its
depths
the
glorious
sun
above
the
scene
inland
was
no
less
beautiful
and
yet
fritz
and
i
both
felt
a
shade
of
loneliness
stealing
over
us
as
we
gazed
on
its
utter
solitude
cheer
up
fritz
my
boy
said
i
presently
remember
that
we
chose
a
settler
life
long
ago
before
we
left
our
own
dear
country
we
certainly
did
not
expect
to
be
so
entirely
alone
but
what
matters
a
few
people
more
or
less
with
god
help
let
us
endeavor
to
live
here
contentedly
thankful
that
we
were
not
cast
upon
some
bare
and
inhospitable
island
but
come
the
heat
here
is
getting
unbearable
let
us
find
some
shady
place
before
we
are
completely
broiled
away
we
descended
the
hill
and
made
for
a
clump
of
palm
trees
which
we
saw
at
a
little
distance
to
reach
this
we
had
to
pass
through
a
dense
thicket
of
reeds
no
pleasant
or
easy
task
for
besides
the
difficulty
of
forcing
our
way
through
i
feared
at
every
step
that
we
might
tread
on
some
venomous
snake
sending
turk
in
advance
i
cut
one
of
the
reeds
thinking
it
would
be
a
more
useful
weapon
against
a
reptile
than
my
gun
i
had
carried
it
but
a
little
way
when
i
noticed
a
thick
juice
exuding
from
one
end
i
tasted
it
and
to
my
delight
found
it
sweet
and
pleasant
i
at
once
knew
that
i
was
standing
amongst
wishing
fritz
to
make
the
same
discovery
i
advised
him
to
cut
a
cane
for
his
defense
he
did
so
and
as
he
beat
the
ground
before
him
the
reed
split
and
his
hand
was
covered
with
the
juice
he
carefully
touched
the
cane
with
the
tip
of
his
tongue
then
finding
the
juice
sweet
he
did
so
again
with
less
hesitation
and
a
moment
afterward
sprang
back
to
me
exclaiming
oh
father
taste
it
oh
how
delicious
how
delightful
do
let
us
take
a
lot
home
to
mother
he
continued
sucking
eagerly
at
the
cane
gently
there
said
i
take
breath
a
moment
moderation
in
all
things
remember
cut
some
to
take
home
if
you
like
only
do
take
more
than
you
can
conveniently
carry
in
spite
of
my
warning
my
son
cut
a
dozen
or
more
of
the
largest
canes
and
stripping
them
of
their
leaves
carried
them
under
his
arm
we
then
pushed
through
the
and
reached
the
clump
of
palms
for
which
we
had
been
making
as
we
entered
it
a
troop
of
monkeys
who
had
been
disporting
themselves
on
the
ground
sprang
up
chattering
and
grimacing
and
before
we
could
clearly
distinguish
them
were
at
the
very
top
of
the
trees
fritz
was
so
provoked
by
their
impertinent
gestures
that
he
raised
his
gun
and
would
have
shot
one
of
the
poor
beasts
stay
cried
i
never
take
the
life
of
any
animal
needlessly
a
live
monkey
up
in
that
tree
is
of
more
use
to
us
than
a
dozen
dead
ones
at
our
feet
as
i
will
show
you
saying
this
i
gathered
a
handful
of
small
stones
and
threw
them
up
toward
the
apes
the
stones
did
not
go
near
them
but
influenced
by
their
instinctive
mania
for
imitation
they
instantly
seized
all
the
cocoanuts
within
their
reach
and
sent
a
perfect
hail
of
them
down
upon
us
illustration
monkeys
seized
all
the
cocoanuts
within
their
reach
and
sent
them
down
upon
fritz
was
delighted
with
my
stratagem
and
rushing
forward
picked
up
some
of
the
finest
of
the
nuts
we
drank
the
milk
they
contained
drawing
it
through
the
holes
which
i
pierced
and
then
splitting
the
nuts
open
with
the
hatchet
ate
the
cream
which
lined
their
shells
after
this
delicious
meal
we
thoroughly
despised
the
lobster
we
had
been
carrying
and
threw
it
to
turk
who
ate
it
gratefully
but
far
from
being
satisfied
the
poor
beast
began
to
gnaw
the
ends
of
the
and
to
beg
for
cocoanut
i
slung
a
couple
of
the
nuts
over
my
shoulder
fastening
them
together
by
their
stalks
and
fritz
having
resumed
his
burden
we
began
our
homeward
march
i
soon
discovered
that
fritz
found
the
weight
of
his
canes
considerably
more
than
he
expected
he
shifted
them
from
shoulder
to
shoulder
then
for
a
while
carried
them
under
his
arm
and
finally
stopped
short
with
a
sigh
i
had
no
idea
he
said
that
a
few
reeds
would
be
so
heavy
never
mind
my
boy
i
said
patience
and
courage
do
you
not
remember
the
story
of
aesop
and
his
how
heavy
he
found
it
when
he
started
and
how
light
at
the
end
of
his
journey
let
us
each
take
a
fresh
staff
and
then
fasten
the
bundle
crosswise
with
your
gun
we
did
so
and
once
more
stepped
forward
fritz
presently
noticed
that
i
from
time
to
time
sucked
the
end
of
my
cane
oh
come
said
he
that
a
capital
plan
of
yours
father
i
do
that
too
so
saying
he
began
to
suck
most
vigorously
but
not
a
drop
of
the
juice
could
he
extract
how
is
this
he
asked
how
do
you
get
the
juice
out
father
think
a
little
i
replied
you
are
quite
as
capable
as
i
am
of
finding
out
the
way
even
if
you
do
not
know
the
real
reason
of
your
failure
oh
of
course
said
he
it
is
like
trying
to
suck
marrow
from
a
without
making
a
hole
at
the
other
end
quite
right
i
said
you
form
a
vacuum
in
your
mouth
and
the
end
of
your
tube
and
expect
the
air
to
force
down
the
liquid
from
the
other
end
which
it
can
not
possibly
enter
fritz
was
speedily
perfect
in
the
accomplishment
of
sucking
discovering
by
experience
the
necessity
for
a
fresh
cut
at
each
joint
or
knot
in
the
cane
through
which
the
juice
would
not
flow
he
talked
of
the
pleasure
of
initiating
his
brothers
in
the
art
and
of
how
ernest
would
enjoy
the
cocoanut
milk
with
which
he
had
filled
his
flask
my
dear
boy
said
i
you
need
not
have
added
that
to
your
load
the
chances
are
it
is
vinegar
by
the
time
we
get
home
in
the
heat
of
the
sun
it
will
ferment
soon
after
being
drawn
from
the
nut
vinegar
oh
that
would
be
a
horrid
bore
i
must
look
directly
and
see
how
it
is
getting
on
cried
fritz
hastily
swinging
the
flask
from
his
shoulder
and
tugging
out
the
cork
with
a
loud
pop
the
contents
came
forth
foaming
like
champagne
there
now
said
i
laughing
as
he
tasted
this
new
luxury
you
will
have
to
exercise
moderation
again
friend
fritz
i
daresay
it
is
delicious
but
it
will
go
to
your
head
if
you
venture
deep
into
your
flask
my
dear
father
you
can
not
think
how
good
it
is
do
take
some
vinegar
indeed
this
is
like
excellent
wine
we
were
both
invigorated
by
this
unexpected
draught
and
went
on
so
merrily
after
it
that
the
distance
to
the
place
where
we
had
left
our
seemed
less
than
we
expected
we
found
them
quite
dry
and
very
light
and
easy
to
carry
just
as
we
had
passed
through
the
grove
in
which
we
had
breakfasted
turk
suddenly
darted
away
from
us
and
sprang
furiously
among
a
troop
of
monkeys
which
were
gamboling
playfully
on
the
turf
at
a
little
distance
from
the
trees
they
were
taken
by
surprise
completely
and
the
dog
now
really
ravenous
from
hunger
had
seized
and
was
fiercely
tearing
one
to
pieces
before
we
could
approach
the
spot
his
luckless
victim
was
the
mother
of
a
tiny
little
monkey
which
being
on
her
back
when
the
dog
flew
at
her
had
hindered
her
flight
the
little
creature
attempted
to
hide
among
the
grass
and
in
trembling
fear
watched
the
tragic
fate
of
its
mother
on
perceiving
design
fritz
had
eagerly
rushed
to
the
rescue
flinging
away
all
he
was
carrying
and
losing
his
hat
in
his
haste
all
to
no
purpose
as
far
as
the
poor
mother
ape
was
concerned
and
a
laughable
scene
ensued
for
no
sooner
did
the
young
monkey
catch
sight
of
him
than
at
one
bound
it
was
on
his
shoulders
and
holding
fast
by
his
thick
curly
hair
it
firmly
kept
its
seat
in
spite
of
all
he
could
do
to
dislodge
it
he
screamed
and
plunged
about
as
he
endeavored
to
shake
or
pull
the
creature
off
but
all
in
vain
it
only
clung
the
closer
to
his
neck
making
the
most
absurd
grimaces
i
laughed
so
much
at
this
ridiculous
scene
that
i
could
scarcely
assist
my
terrified
boy
out
of
his
awkward
predicament
at
last
by
coaxing
the
monkey
offering
it
a
bit
of
biscuit
and
gradually
disentangling
its
small
sinewy
paws
from
the
curls
it
grasped
so
tightly
i
managed
to
relieve
poor
fritz
who
then
looked
with
interest
at
the
baby
ape
no
bigger
than
a
kitten
as
it
lay
in
my
arms
what
a
jolly
little
fellow
it
is
exclaimed
he
do
let
me
try
to
rear
it
father
i
daresay
cocoanut
milk
would
do
until
we
can
bring
the
cow
and
the
goats
from
the
wreck
if
he
lives
he
might
be
useful
to
us
i
believe
monkeys
instinctively
know
what
fruits
are
wholesome
and
what
are
poisonous
well
said
i
let
the
little
orphan
be
yours
you
bravely
and
kindly
exerted
yourself
to
save
the
mother
life
now
you
must
train
her
child
carefully
for
unless
you
do
so
its
natural
instinct
will
prove
mischievous
instead
of
useful
to
us
turk
was
meanwhile
devouring
with
great
satisfaction
the
little
unfortunate
mother
i
could
not
grudge
it
him
and
continued
hunger
might
have
made
him
dangerous
to
ourselves
we
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
wait
until
he
had
dined
so
we
prepared
to
resume
our
march
the
tiny
ape
seated
itself
in
the
coolest
way
imaginable
on
shoulder
i
helped
to
carry
his
canes
and
we
were
on
some
distance
before
turk
overtook
us
looking
uncommonly
well
pleased
and
licking
his
chops
as
though
recalling
the
memory
of
his
feast
he
took
no
notice
of
the
monkey
but
it
was
very
uneasy
at
sight
of
him
and
scrambled
down
into
fritz
arms
which
was
so
inconvenient
to
him
that
he
devised
a
plan
to
relieve
himself
of
his
burden
calling
turk
and
seriously
enjoining
obedience
he
seated
the
monkey
on
his
back
securing
it
there
with
a
cord
and
then
putting
a
second
string
round
the
dog
neck
that
he
might
lead
him
he
put
a
loop
of
the
knot
into
the
comical
rider
hand
saying
gravely
having
slain
the
parent
turk
you
will
please
to
carry
the
son
at
first
this
arrangement
mightily
displeased
them
both
but
by
and
by
they
yielded
to
it
quietly
the
monkey
especially
amused
us
by
riding
along
with
the
air
of
a
person
perfectly
at
his
ease
we
look
just
like
a
couple
of
mountebanks
on
their
way
to
a
fair
with
animals
to
exhibit
said
i
what
an
outcry
the
children
will
make
when
we
appear
my
son
inquired
to
what
species
of
the
monkey
tribe
i
thought
his
protégé
belonged
which
led
to
a
good
deal
of
talk
on
the
subject
and
conversation
beguiling
the
way
we
found
ourselves
ere
long
on
the
rocky
margin
of
the
stream
and
close
to
the
rest
of
our
party
juno
was
the
first
to
be
aware
of
our
approach
and
gave
notice
of
it
by
loud
barking
to
which
turk
replied
with
such
hearty
good
will
that
his
little
rider
terrified
at
the
noise
his
steed
was
making
slipped
from
under
the
cord
and
fled
to
his
refuge
on
fritz
shoulder
where
he
regained
his
composure
and
settled
himself
comfortably
turk
who
by
this
time
knew
where
he
was
finding
himself
free
dashed
forward
to
rejoin
his
friends
and
announce
our
coming
one
after
another
our
dear
ones
came
running
to
the
opposite
bank
testifying
in
various
ways
their
delight
at
our
return
and
hastening
up
on
their
side
of
the
river
as
we
on
ours
to
the
ford
at
which
we
had
crossed
in
the
morning
we
were
quickly
on
the
other
side
and
full
of
joy
and
affection
our
happy
party
was
once
more
united
the
boys
suddenly
perceiving
the
little
animal
which
was
clinging
close
to
their
brother
in
alarm
at
the
tumult
of
voices
shouted
in
ecstasy
a
monkey
a
monkey
oh
how
splendid
where
did
fritz
find
him
what
may
we
give
him
to
eat
oh
what
a
bundle
of
sticks
look
at
those
curious
great
nuts
father
has
got
we
could
neither
check
this
confused
torrent
of
questions
nor
get
in
a
word
in
answer
to
them
at
length
when
the
excitement
subsided
a
little
i
was
able
to
say
a
few
words
with
a
chance
of
being
listened
to
i
am
truly
thankful
to
see
you
all
safe
and
well
and
thank
god
our
expedition
has
been
very
satisfactory
except
that
we
have
entirely
failed
to
discover
any
trace
of
our
shipmates
if
it
be
the
will
of
god
said
my
wife
to
leave
us
alone
on
this
solitary
place
let
us
be
content
and
rejoice
that
we
are
all
together
in
safety
now
we
want
to
hear
all
your
adventures
and
let
us
relieve
you
of
your
burdens
added
she
taking
my
game
bag
jack
shouldered
my
gun
ernest
took
the
cocoanuts
and
little
franz
carried
the
gourds
fritz
distributed
the
sugar
canes
amongst
his
brothers
and
handing
ernest
his
gun
replaced
the
monkey
on
turk
back
ernest
soon
found
the
burden
with
which
fritz
had
laden
him
too
heavy
for
his
taste
his
mother
perceiving
this
offered
to
relieve
him
of
part
of
the
load
he
gave
up
willingly
the
cocoanuts
but
no
sooner
had
he
done
so
than
his
elder
brother
exclaimed
hullo
ernest
you
surely
do
not
know
what
you
are
parting
with
did
you
really
intend
to
hand
over
those
good
cocoanuts
without
so
much
as
tasting
them
what
ho
are
they
really
cocoanuts
cried
ernest
do
let
me
take
them
again
mother
do
let
me
look
at
them
no
thank
you
replied
my
wife
with
a
smile
i
have
no
wish
to
see
you
again
overburdened
oh
but
i
have
only
to
throw
away
these
sticks
which
are
of
no
use
and
then
i
can
easily
carry
them
worse
and
worse
said
fritz
i
have
a
particular
regard
for
those
heavy
useless
sticks
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
words
were
scarcely
out
of
his
mouth
when
ernest
began
to
suck
vigorously
at
the
end
of
the
cane
with
no
better
result
however
than
fritz
had
obtained
as
we
were
on
the
march
here
said
fritz
let
me
show
you
the
trick
of
it
and
he
speedily
set
all
the
youngsters
to
work
extracting
the
luscious
juice
my
wife
as
a
prudent
housekeeper
was
no
less
delighted
than
the
children
with
this
discovery
the
sight
of
the
dishes
also
pleased
her
greatly
for
she
longed
to
see
us
eat
once
more
like
civilized
beings
we
went
into
the
kitchen
and
there
found
preparations
for
a
truly
sumptuous
meal
two
forked
sticks
were
planted
in
the
ground
on
either
side
of
the
fire
on
these
rested
a
rod
from
which
hung
several
tempting
looking
fish
opposite
them
hung
a
goose
from
a
similar
contrivance
slowly
roasting
while
the
gravy
dropped
into
a
large
shell
placed
beneath
it
in
the
center
sat
the
great
pot
from
which
issued
the
smell
of
a
most
delicious
soup
to
crown
this
splendid
array
stood
an
open
hogshead
full
of
dutch
cheeses
all
this
was
very
pleasant
to
two
hungry
travelers
but
i
was
about
to
beg
my
wife
to
spare
the
poultry
until
our
stock
should
have
increased
when
she
perceiving
my
thought
quickly
relieved
my
anxiety
this
is
not
one
of
our
geese
she
said
but
a
wild
bird
ernest
killed
yes
said
ernest
it
is
a
penguin
i
think
it
let
me
get
quite
close
so
that
i
knocked
it
on
the
head
with
a
stick
here
are
its
head
and
feet
which
i
preserved
to
show
you
the
bill
is
you
see
narrow
and
curved
downward
and
the
feet
are
webbed
it
had
funny
little
bits
of
useless
wings
and
its
eyes
looked
so
solemnly
and
sedately
at
me
that
i
was
almost
ashamed
to
kill
it
do
you
not
think
it
must
have
been
a
penguin
i
have
little
doubt
on
the
matter
my
boy
and
i
was
about
to
make
a
few
remarks
on
the
habits
of
this
bird
when
my
wife
interrupted
me
and
begged
us
to
come
to
dinner
and
continue
our
natural
history
conversation
at
some
future
time
we
then
sat
down
before
the
appetizing
meal
prepared
for
us
our
gourds
coming
for
the
first
time
into
use
and
having
done
it
full
justice
produced
the
cocoanuts
by
way
of
dessert
here
is
better
food
for
your
little
friend
said
i
to
fritz
who
had
been
vainly
endeavoring
to
persuade
the
monkey
to
taste
dainty
morsels
of
the
food
we
had
been
eating
the
poor
little
animal
has
been
accustomed
to
nothing
but
its
mother
milk
fetch
me
a
saw
one
of
you
i
then
after
extracting
the
milk
of
the
nuts
from
their
natural
holes
carefully
cut
the
shells
in
half
thus
providing
several
more
useful
basins
the
monkey
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
milk
and
eagerly
sucked
the
corner
of
a
handkerchief
dipped
in
it
fritz
now
suddenly
recollected
his
delicious
wine
and
producing
his
flask
begged
his
mother
to
taste
it
try
it
first
yourself
said
i
fritz
did
so
and
i
instantly
saw
by
his
countenance
that
the
liquor
had
passed
through
the
first
stage
of
fermentation
and
had
become
vinegar
never
mind
my
boy
said
my
prudent
wife
when
she
learned
the
cause
of
his
wry
faces
we
have
wine
already
but
no
vinegar
i
am
really
pleased
at
the
transformation
the
sun
was
now
rapidly
sinking
behind
the
horizon
and
the
poultry
retiring
for
the
night
warned
us
that
we
must
follow
their
example
having
offered
up
our
prayers
we
lay
down
on
our
beds
the
monkey
crouched
down
between
jack
and
fritz
and
we
were
all
soon
fast
asleep
we
did
not
however
long
enjoy
this
repose
a
loud
barking
from
our
dogs
who
were
on
guard
outside
the
tent
awakened
us
and
the
fluttering
and
cackling
of
our
poultry
warned
us
that
a
foe
was
approaching
fritz
and
i
sprang
up
and
seizing
our
guns
rushed
out
there
we
found
a
desperate
combat
going
on
our
gallant
dogs
surrounded
by
a
dozen
or
more
large
jackals
were
fighting
bravely
four
of
their
opponents
lay
dead
but
the
others
were
in
no
way
deterred
by
the
fate
of
their
comrades
fritz
and
i
however
sent
bullets
through
the
heads
of
a
couple
more
and
the
rest
galloped
off
turk
and
juno
did
not
intend
that
they
should
escape
so
cheaply
and
pursuing
them
they
caught
killed
and
devoured
another
of
the
animals
regardless
of
their
near
relationship
fritz
wished
to
save
one
of
the
jackals
that
he
might
be
able
to
show
it
to
his
brothers
in
the
morning
dragging
therefore
the
one
that
he
had
shot
near
the
tent
he
concealed
it
and
we
once
more
returned
to
our
beds
soundly
and
peacefully
we
slept
until
next
morning
when
my
wife
and
i
awoke
and
began
to
discuss
the
business
of
the
day
it
seems
absolutely
necessary
my
dear
wife
i
began
to
return
at
once
to
the
wreck
while
it
is
yet
calm
that
we
may
save
the
poor
animals
left
there
and
bring
on
shore
many
articles
of
infinite
value
to
us
which
if
we
do
not
now
recover
we
may
finally
lose
entirely
on
the
other
hand
i
feel
that
there
is
an
immense
deal
to
be
done
on
shore
and
that
i
ought
not
to
leave
you
in
such
an
insecure
shelter
as
this
tent
return
to
the
wreck
by
all
means
replied
my
wife
cheerfully
patience
order
and
perseverance
will
help
us
through
all
our
work
and
i
agree
with
you
that
a
visit
to
the
wreck
is
without
doubt
our
first
duty
come
let
us
wake
the
children
and
set
to
work
without
delay
they
were
soon
roused
and
fritz
overcoming
his
drowsiness
before
the
others
ran
out
for
his
jackal
it
was
cold
and
stiff
from
the
night
air
and
he
placed
it
on
its
legs
before
the
tent
in
a
most
attitude
and
stood
by
to
watch
the
effect
upon
the
family
the
dogs
were
the
first
to
perceive
their
enemy
and
growling
seemed
inclined
to
dispose
of
the
animal
as
they
had
disposed
of
its
brethren
in
the
night
but
fritz
called
them
off
the
noise
the
dogs
made
however
had
the
effect
of
bringing
out
the
younger
children
and
many
were
the
exclamations
they
made
at
the
sight
of
the
strange
animal
a
yellow
dog
cried
franz
a
wolf
exclaimed
jack
it
is
a
striped
fox
said
ernest
hullo
said
fritz
the
greatest
men
may
make
mistakes
our
professor
does
not
know
a
jackal
when
he
sees
one
but
really
continued
ernest
examining
the
animal
i
think
it
is
a
fox
very
well
very
well
retorted
fritz
no
doubt
you
know
better
than
your
father
he
thinks
it
is
a
jackal
come
boys
said
i
no
more
of
this
quarreling
you
are
none
of
you
very
far
wrong
for
the
jackal
partakes
of
the
nature
of
all
three
dog
wolf
and
fox
the
monkey
had
come
out
on
jack
shoulder
but
no
sooner
did
it
catch
sight
of
the
jackal
than
it
fled
precipitately
back
into
the
tent
and
hid
itself
in
a
heap
of
moss
until
nothing
was
visible
but
the
tip
of
its
little
nose
jack
soothed
and
comforted
the
frightened
little
animal
and
i
then
summoned
them
all
to
prayers
soon
after
which
we
began
our
breakfast
so
severely
had
we
dealt
with
our
supper
the
previous
night
that
we
had
little
to
eat
but
the
biscuits
which
were
so
dry
and
hard
that
hungry
as
we
were
we
could
not
swallow
much
fritz
and
i
took
some
cheese
to
help
them
down
while
my
wife
and
younger
sons
soaked
theirs
in
water
ernest
roamed
down
to
the
shore
and
looked
about
for
presently
he
returned
with
a
few
whelks
ah
said
he
if
we
had
but
some
butter
my
good
boy
i
replied
your
perpetual
if
if
quite
annoys
me
why
do
you
not
sit
down
and
eat
cheese
like
the
rest
of
us
not
while
i
can
get
butter
he
said
see
here
father
and
he
pointed
to
a
large
cask
that
barrel
contains
butter
of
some
sort
or
another
for
it
is
oozing
out
at
the
end
really
ernest
i
said
we
are
indebted
to
you
i
will
open
the
cask
so
saying
i
took
a
knife
and
carefully
cut
a
small
hole
so
that
i
could
extract
the
butter
without
exposing
the
mass
of
it
to
the
effects
of
the
air
and
heat
filling
a
cocoanut
shell
we
once
more
sat
down
and
toasting
our
biscuits
before
the
fire
spread
them
with
the
good
dutch
butter
we
found
this
vastly
better
than
the
dry
biscuits
and
while
we
were
thus
employed
i
noticed
that
the
two
dogs
were
lying
unusually
quiet
by
my
side
i
at
first
attributed
this
drowsiness
to
their
large
meal
during
the
night
but
i
soon
discovered
that
it
arose
from
a
different
cause
the
faithful
animals
had
not
escaped
unhurt
from
their
late
combat
but
had
received
several
deep
and
painful
wounds
especially
about
the
neck
the
dogs
began
to
lick
each
other
on
the
places
which
they
could
not
reach
with
their
own
tongues
and
my
wife
carefully
dressed
the
wounds
with
butter
from
which
she
had
extracted
the
salt
by
washing
a
sudden
thought
now
struck
ernest
and
he
wisely
remarked
that
if
we
were
to
make
spiked
collars
for
the
dogs
they
would
in
future
escape
such
dangerous
wounds
oh
yes
exclaimed
jack
and
i
will
make
them
may
i
not
father
try
by
all
means
my
little
fellow
said
i
and
persuade
your
mother
to
assist
you
and
now
fritz
i
continued
we
must
be
starting
for
you
and
i
are
to
make
a
trip
to
the
wreck
i
begged
the
party
who
were
to
remain
on
shore
to
keep
together
as
much
as
possible
and
having
arranged
a
set
of
signals
with
my
wife
that
we
might
exchange
communications
asked
a
blessing
on
our
enterprise
i
erected
a
signal
post
and
while
fritz
was
making
preparations
for
our
departure
hoisted
a
strip
of
sailcloth
as
a
flag
this
flag
was
to
remain
hoisted
so
long
as
all
was
well
on
shore
but
should
our
return
be
desired
three
shots
were
to
be
fired
and
the
flag
lowered
all
was
now
ready
and
warning
my
wife
that
we
might
find
it
necessary
to
remain
all
night
on
the
vessel
we
tenderly
bade
adieu
and
embarked
except
our
guns
and
ammunition
we
were
taking
nothing
that
we
might
leave
as
much
space
as
possible
for
the
stowage
of
a
large
cargo
fritz
however
had
resolved
to
bring
his
little
monkey
that
he
might
obtain
milk
for
it
as
soon
as
possible
we
had
not
got
far
from
the
shore
when
i
perceived
that
a
current
from
the
river
set
in
directly
for
the
vessel
and
though
my
nautical
knowledge
was
not
great
i
succeeded
in
steering
the
boat
into
the
favorable
stream
which
carried
us
nearly
of
our
passage
with
little
or
no
trouble
to
ourselves
then
by
dint
of
hard
pulling
we
accomplished
the
whole
distance
and
entering
through
the
breach
gladly
made
fast
our
boat
and
stepped
on
board
our
first
care
was
to
see
to
the
animals
who
greeted
us
with
joy
lowing
bellowing
and
bleating
as
we
approached
not
that
the
poor
beasts
were
hungry
for
they
were
all
still
well
supplied
with
food
but
they
were
apparently
pleased
by
the
mere
sight
of
human
beings
fritz
then
placed
his
monkey
by
one
of
the
goats
and
the
little
animal
immediately
sucked
the
milk
with
evident
relish
chattering
and
grinning
all
the
while
the
monkey
provided
for
we
refreshed
ourselves
with
some
wine
and
biscuits
now
said
i
we
have
plenty
to
do
where
shall
we
begin
let
us
fix
a
mast
and
sail
to
our
boat
answered
fritz
for
the
current
which
brought
us
out
will
not
take
us
back
whereas
the
fresh
breeze
we
met
would
help
us
immensely
had
we
but
a
sail
capital
thought
i
replied
let
us
set
to
work
at
once
i
chose
a
stout
spar
to
serve
as
a
mast
and
having
made
a
hole
in
a
plank
nailed
across
one
of
the
tubs
we
with
the
help
of
a
rope
and
a
couple
of
blocks
stepped
it
and
secured
it
with
stays
we
then
discovered
a
which
had
belonged
to
one
of
the
ship
boats
this
we
hoisted
and
our
craft
was
ready
to
sail
fritz
begged
me
to
decorate
the
mast
head
with
a
red
streamer
to
give
our
vessel
a
more
finished
appearance
smiling
at
this
childish
but
natural
vanity
i
complied
with
his
request
i
then
contrived
a
rudder
that
i
might
be
able
to
steer
the
boat
for
though
i
knew
that
an
oar
would
serve
the
purpose
it
was
cumbrous
and
inconvenient
while
i
was
thus
employed
fritz
examined
the
shore
with
his
glass
and
soon
announced
that
the
flag
was
flying
and
all
was
well
so
much
time
had
now
slipped
away
that
we
found
we
could
not
return
that
night
as
i
had
wished
we
signaled
our
intention
of
remaining
on
board
and
then
spent
the
rest
of
our
time
in
taking
out
the
stones
we
had
placed
in
the
boat
for
ballast
and
stowed
in
their
place
heavy
articles
of
value
to
us
the
ship
had
sailed
for
the
purpose
of
supplying
a
young
colony
she
had
therefore
on
board
every
conceivable
article
we
could
desire
in
our
present
situation
our
only
difficulty
indeed
was
to
make
a
wise
selection
a
large
quantity
of
powder
and
shot
we
first
secured
and
as
fritz
considered
that
we
could
not
have
too
many
weapons
we
added
three
excellent
guns
and
a
whole
armful
of
swords
daggers
and
knives
we
remembered
that
knives
and
forks
were
necessary
we
therefore
laid
in
a
large
stock
of
them
and
kitchen
utensils
of
all
sorts
exploring
the
captain
cabin
we
discovered
a
service
of
silver
plate
and
a
cellaret
of
good
old
wine
we
then
went
over
the
stores
and
supplied
ourselves
with
potted
meats
portable
soups
westphalian
hams
sausages
a
bag
of
maize
and
wheat
and
a
quantity
of
other
seeds
and
vegetables
i
then
added
a
barrel
of
sulphur
for
matches
and
as
much
cordage
as
i
could
find
all
this
with
nails
tools
and
agricultural
implements
completed
our
cargo
and
sank
our
boat
so
low
that
i
should
have
been
obliged
to
lighten
her
had
not
the
sea
been
calm
night
drew
on
and
a
large
fire
lighted
by
those
on
shore
showed
us
that
all
was
well
we
replied
by
hoisting
four
ship
lanterns
and
two
shots
announced
to
us
that
our
signal
was
perceived
then
with
a
heartfelt
prayer
for
the
safety
of
our
dear
ones
on
shore
we
retired
to
our
boat
and
fritz
at
all
events
was
soon
sound
asleep
for
a
while
i
could
not
sleep
the
thought
of
my
wife
and
children
alone
and
unprotected
save
by
the
great
dogs
disturbed
my
rest
the
night
at
length
passed
away
at
daybreak
fritz
and
i
arose
and
went
on
deck
i
brought
the
telescope
to
bear
upon
the
shore
and
with
pleasure
saw
the
flag
still
waving
in
the
morning
breeze
while
i
kept
the
glass
directed
to
the
land
i
saw
the
door
of
the
tent
open
and
my
wife
appear
and
look
steadfastly
toward
us
i
at
once
hoisted
a
white
flag
and
in
reply
the
flag
on
shore
was
thrice
dipped
oh
what
a
weight
seemed
lifted
from
my
heart
as
i
saw
the
signal
fritz
i
said
i
am
not
now
in
such
haste
to
get
back
and
begin
to
feel
compassion
for
all
these
poor
beasts
i
wish
we
could
devise
some
means
for
getting
them
on
shore
we
might
make
a
raft
suggested
fritz
and
take
off
one
or
two
at
a
time
true
i
replied
it
is
easy
enough
to
say
a
raft
but
to
do
it
is
quite
another
thing
well
said
fritz
i
can
think
of
nothing
else
unless
indeed
we
make
them
such
swimming
belts
as
you
made
for
the
children
really
my
boy
that
idea
is
worth
having
i
am
not
joking
indeed
i
continued
as
i
saw
him
smile
we
may
get
every
one
of
the
animals
ashore
in
that
way
so
saying
i
caught
a
fine
sheep
and
proceeded
to
put
our
plan
into
execution
i
first
fastened
a
broad
piece
of
linen
round
its
belly
and
to
this
attached
some
corks
and
empty
tins
then
with
fritz
help
i
flung
the
animal
into
the
sea
it
sank
but
a
moment
afterward
rose
and
floated
famously
hurrah
exclaimed
fritz
we
will
treat
them
all
like
that
we
then
rapidly
caught
the
other
animals
and
provided
them
one
after
the
other
with
a
similar
contrivance
the
cow
and
ass
gave
us
more
trouble
than
did
the
others
as
for
them
we
required
something
more
buoyant
than
the
mere
cork
we
at
last
found
some
empty
casks
and
fastened
two
to
each
animal
by
thongs
passed
under
its
belly
this
done
the
whole
herd
were
ready
to
start
and
we
brought
the
ass
to
one
of
the
ports
to
be
the
first
to
be
launched
after
some
maneuvering
we
got
him
in
a
convenient
position
and
then
a
sudden
heave
sent
him
plunging
into
the
sea
he
sank
and
then
buoyed
up
by
the
casks
emerged
head
and
back
from
the
water
the
cow
sheep
and
goats
followed
him
one
after
the
other
and
then
the
sow
alone
remained
she
seemed
however
determined
not
to
leave
the
ship
she
kicked
struggled
and
squealed
so
violently
that
i
really
thought
we
should
be
obliged
to
abandon
her
at
length
after
much
trouble
we
succeeded
in
sending
her
out
of
the
port
after
the
others
and
when
once
in
the
water
such
was
the
old
lady
energy
that
she
quickly
distanced
them
and
was
the
first
to
reach
the
shore
we
had
fastened
to
the
horns
or
neck
of
each
animal
a
cord
with
a
float
attached
to
the
end
and
now
embarking
we
gathered
up
these
floats
set
sail
and
steered
for
shore
drawing
our
herd
after
us
delighted
with
the
successful
accomplishment
of
our
task
we
got
out
some
biscuits
and
enjoyed
a
meal
then
while
fritz
amused
himself
with
his
monkey
i
took
up
my
glass
and
tried
to
make
out
how
our
dear
ones
on
shore
were
employing
themselves
as
i
was
thus
engaged
a
sudden
shout
from
fritz
surprised
me
i
glanced
up
there
stood
fritz
with
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
pointing
it
at
a
huge
shark
the
monster
was
making
for
one
of
the
finest
sheep
he
turned
on
his
side
to
seize
his
prey
as
the
white
of
his
belly
appeared
fritz
fired
the
shot
took
effect
and
our
enemy
disappeared
leaving
a
trace
of
blood
on
the
calm
water
well
done
my
boy
i
cried
you
will
become
a
crack
shot
one
of
these
days
but
i
trust
you
will
not
often
have
such
dangerous
game
to
shoot
fritz
eyes
sparkled
at
his
success
and
my
praise
and
reloading
his
gun
carefully
watched
the
water
but
the
shark
did
not
again
appear
and
borne
onward
by
the
breeze
we
quickly
neared
the
shore
steering
the
boat
to
a
convenient
landing
place
i
cast
off
the
ropes
which
secured
the
animals
and
let
them
get
ashore
as
best
they
might
there
was
no
sign
of
my
wife
or
children
when
we
stepped
on
land
but
a
few
moments
afterward
they
appeared
and
with
a
shout
of
joy
ran
toward
us
we
were
thankful
to
be
once
more
united
and
after
asking
and
replying
to
a
few
preliminary
questions
proceeded
to
release
our
herd
from
their
swimming
belts
which
though
so
useful
in
the
water
were
exceedingly
inconvenient
on
shore
my
wife
was
astonished
at
the
apparatus
how
clever
you
are
said
she
i
am
not
the
inventor
i
replied
the
honor
is
due
to
fritz
he
not
only
thought
of
this
plan
for
bringing
off
the
animals
but
saved
one
at
least
of
them
from
a
most
fearful
death
and
i
then
told
them
how
bravely
he
had
encountered
the
shark
my
wife
was
delighted
with
her
son
success
but
declared
that
she
would
dread
our
trips
to
the
vessel
more
than
ever
knowing
that
such
savage
fish
inhabited
the
waters
fritz
ernest
and
i
began
the
work
of
unloading
our
craft
while
jack
seeing
that
the
poor
donkey
was
still
encumbered
with
his
swimming
belt
tried
to
free
him
from
it
but
the
donkey
would
not
stand
quiet
and
the
child
fingers
were
not
strong
enough
to
loosen
the
cordage
finally
therefore
he
scrambled
upon
the
animal
back
and
urging
him
on
with
hand
and
foot
trotted
toward
us
come
my
boy
i
said
no
one
must
be
idle
here
even
for
a
moment
you
will
have
riding
practice
enough
hereafter
dismount
and
come
and
help
us
jack
was
soon
on
his
feet
but
i
have
not
been
idle
all
day
he
said
look
here
and
he
pointed
to
a
belt
round
his
waist
it
was
a
broad
belt
of
yellow
hair
in
which
he
had
stuck
a
couple
of
pistols
and
a
knife
and
see
he
added
what
i
have
made
for
the
dogs
here
juno
turk
the
dogs
came
bounding
up
at
his
call
and
i
saw
that
they
were
each
supplied
with
a
collar
of
the
same
skin
in
which
were
fastened
nails
which
bristled
round
their
necks
in
a
most
formidable
manner
capital
capital
my
boy
said
i
but
where
did
you
get
your
materials
and
who
helped
you
except
in
cutting
the
skin
said
my
wife
he
had
no
assistance
and
as
for
the
materials
fritz
jackal
supplied
us
with
the
skin
and
the
needles
and
thread
came
out
of
my
wonderful
bag
you
little
think
how
many
useful
things
may
be
had
from
that
same
bag
it
is
woman
duty
and
nature
you
know
to
see
after
trifles
fritz
evidently
did
not
approve
of
the
use
to
which
his
jackal
hide
had
been
devoted
and
holding
his
nose
begged
his
little
brother
to
keep
at
a
distance
really
jack
he
said
you
should
have
cured
the
hide
before
you
used
it
the
smell
is
disgusting
do
come
near
me
it
not
the
hide
that
smells
at
all
retorted
jack
it
is
your
nasty
jackal
itself
that
you
left
in
the
sun
now
boys
said
i
no
quarreling
here
do
you
jack
help
your
brother
to
drag
the
carcass
to
the
sea
and
if
your
belt
smells
after
that
you
must
take
it
off
and
dry
it
better
the
jackal
was
dragged
off
and
we
then
finished
our
work
of
unloading
our
boat
when
this
was
accomplished
we
started
for
our
tent
and
finding
no
preparation
for
supper
i
said
fritz
let
us
have
a
westphalian
ham
ernest
said
my
wife
smiling
let
us
see
if
we
can
not
conjure
up
some
eggs
fritz
got
out
a
splendid
ham
and
carried
it
to
his
mother
triumphantly
while
ernest
set
before
me
a
dozen
white
balls
with
coverings
turtles
eggs
said
i
well
done
ernest
where
did
you
get
them
that
replied
my
wife
shall
be
told
in
due
course
when
we
relate
our
adventures
now
we
will
see
what
they
will
do
toward
making
a
supper
for
you
with
these
and
your
ham
i
do
not
think
we
shall
starve
leaving
my
wife
to
prepare
supper
we
returned
to
the
shore
and
brought
up
what
of
the
cargo
we
had
left
there
then
having
collected
our
herd
of
animals
we
returned
to
the
tent
the
meal
which
awaited
us
was
as
unlike
the
first
supper
we
had
there
enjoyed
as
possible
my
wife
had
improvised
a
table
of
a
board
laid
on
two
casks
on
this
was
spread
a
white
damask
tablecloth
on
which
were
placed
knives
forks
spoons
and
plates
for
each
person
a
tureen
of
good
soup
first
appeared
followed
by
a
capital
omelette
then
slices
of
the
ham
and
finally
some
dutch
cheese
butter
and
biscuits
with
a
bottle
of
the
captain
canary
wine
completed
the
repast
while
we
thus
regaled
ourselves
i
related
to
my
wife
our
adventures
and
then
begged
she
would
remember
her
promise
and
tell
me
all
that
had
happened
in
my
absence
chapter
iii
our
home
in
the
giant
tree
i
will
spare
you
a
description
said
my
wife
of
our
first
occupations
truth
to
tell
i
spent
the
time
chiefly
in
anxious
thought
and
watching
your
progress
and
signals
i
rose
very
early
this
morning
and
with
the
utmost
joy
perceiving
your
signal
that
all
was
right
hastened
to
reply
to
it
and
then
while
my
sons
yet
slumbered
i
sat
down
and
began
to
consider
how
our
position
could
be
improved
it
is
perfectly
impossible
said
i
to
myself
live
much
longer
where
we
are
now
the
sun
beats
burningly
the
lifelong
day
on
this
bare
rocky
spot
our
only
shelter
is
this
poor
tent
beneath
the
canvas
of
which
the
heat
is
even
more
oppressive
than
on
the
open
shore
why
should
not
i
and
my
little
boys
exert
ourselves
as
well
as
my
husband
and
fritz
why
should
not
we
too
try
to
accomplish
something
useful
if
we
could
but
exchange
this
melancholy
and
unwholesome
abode
for
a
pleasant
shady
dwelling
place
we
should
all
improve
in
health
and
spirits
among
those
delightful
woods
and
groves
where
fritz
and
his
father
saw
so
many
charming
things
i
feel
sure
there
must
be
some
little
retreat
where
we
could
establish
ourselves
comfortably
there
must
be
and
i
will
find
it
by
this
time
the
boys
were
up
and
i
observed
jack
very
quietly
and
busily
occupied
with
his
knife
about
the
spot
where
fritz
jackal
lay
watching
his
proceedings
i
saw
that
he
had
cut
two
long
narrow
strips
of
the
animal
skin
which
he
cleaned
and
scraped
very
carefully
and
then
taking
a
handful
of
great
nails
out
of
his
pocket
he
stuck
them
through
the
skin
points
outward
after
which
he
cut
strips
of
canvas
sailcloth
twice
as
broad
as
the
thongs
doubled
them
and
laid
them
on
the
raw
side
of
the
skin
so
as
to
cover
the
broad
flat
nail
heads
at
this
point
of
the
performance
master
jack
came
to
me
with
the
agreeable
request
that
i
would
kindly
stitch
the
canvas
and
moist
skin
together
for
him
i
gave
him
needles
and
thread
but
could
not
think
of
depriving
him
of
the
pleasure
of
doing
it
himself
however
when
i
saw
how
he
persevered
in
the
work
with
his
awkward
unskillful
fingers
i
took
pity
on
him
and
conquering
the
disgust
i
felt
finished
lining
the
skin
he
had
so
ingeniously
contrived
after
this
i
was
called
upon
to
complete
in
the
same
way
a
fine
belt
of
skin
he
had
made
for
himself
i
advised
him
to
think
of
some
means
by
which
the
skin
might
be
kept
from
shrinking
ernest
although
rather
treating
jack
manufacture
with
ridicule
proposed
a
sensible
enough
plan
which
jack
forthwith
put
into
execution
he
nailed
the
skin
stretched
flat
on
a
board
and
put
it
in
the
sun
to
dry
my
scheme
of
a
journey
was
agreed
to
joyously
by
my
young
companions
preparations
were
instantly
set
on
foot
weapons
and
provisions
provided
the
two
elder
boys
carrying
guns
while
they
gave
me
charge
of
the
water
flask
and
a
small
hatchet
leaving
everything
in
as
good
order
as
we
could
at
the
tent
we
proceeded
toward
the
stream
accompanied
by
the
dogs
turk
who
had
accompanied
you
on
your
first
expedition
seemed
immediately
to
understand
that
we
wished
to
pursue
the
same
route
and
proudly
led
the
way
as
i
looked
at
my
two
young
sons
each
with
his
gun
and
considered
how
much
the
safety
of
the
party
depended
on
these
little
fellows
i
felt
grateful
to
you
dear
husband
for
having
acquainted
them
in
childhood
with
the
use
of
firearms
filling
our
we
crossed
the
stream
and
went
on
to
the
height
whence
as
you
described
a
lovely
prospect
is
obtained
at
the
sight
of
which
a
pleasurable
sensation
of
buoyant
hope
to
which
i
had
long
been
a
stranger
awoke
within
my
breast
a
pretty
little
wood
in
the
distance
attracted
my
notice
particularly
and
thither
we
directed
our
course
but
soon
finding
it
impossible
to
force
our
way
through
the
tall
strong
grass
which
grew
in
dense
luxuriance
higher
than
the
children
heads
we
turned
toward
the
open
beach
on
our
left
and
following
it
we
reached
a
point
much
nearer
the
little
wood
when
quitting
the
strand
we
made
toward
it
we
had
not
entirely
escaped
the
tall
grass
however
and
with
the
utmost
fatigue
and
difficulty
were
struggling
through
the
reeds
when
suddenly
a
great
rushing
noise
terrified
us
all
dreadfully
a
very
large
and
powerful
bird
sprang
upward
on
the
wing
both
boys
attempted
to
take
aim
but
the
bird
was
far
away
before
they
were
ready
to
fire
dear
what
a
pity
exclaimed
ernest
if
i
had
only
had
my
light
gun
and
if
the
bird
had
not
flown
quite
so
fast
i
should
have
brought
him
down
directly
yes
said
i
doubt
you
would
be
a
capital
sportsman
if
only
your
game
would
always
give
you
time
to
make
ready
comfortably
i
had
no
notion
that
anything
was
going
to
fly
up
just
at
our
feet
like
that
cried
he
good
shot
i
replied
be
prepared
for
surprises
neither
wild
birds
nor
wild
beasts
will
send
you
notice
that
they
are
about
to
fly
or
to
run
sort
of
bird
can
it
have
been
inquired
jack
it
certainly
must
have
been
an
eagle
answered
little
franz
was
so
very
big
as
if
every
big
bird
must
be
an
eagle
replied
ernest
in
a
tone
of
derision
see
where
he
was
sitting
at
all
events
said
i
jack
sprang
toward
the
place
and
instantly
a
second
bird
rather
larger
than
the
first
rushed
upward
into
the
air
with
a
most
startling
noise
the
boys
stood
staring
upward
perfectly
stupefied
while
i
laughed
heartily
saying
you
are
sportsmen
to
be
sure
you
certainly
will
keep
my
larder
famously
well
supplied
at
this
ernest
colored
up
and
looked
inclined
to
cry
while
jack
put
on
a
comical
face
pulled
off
his
cap
and
with
a
low
bow
called
after
the
fugitive
for
the
present
sir
i
live
in
hopes
of
another
meeting
on
searching
the
ground
carefully
we
discovered
a
rude
sort
of
nest
made
untidily
of
dry
grass
it
was
empty
although
we
perceived
broken
egg
shells
at
no
great
distance
and
concluded
that
the
young
brood
had
escaped
among
the
grass
which
in
fact
we
could
see
was
waving
at
a
little
distance
as
the
little
birds
ran
through
it
look
here
franz
said
ernest
presently
consider
how
this
bird
could
by
any
possibility
have
been
an
eagle
eagles
never
build
on
the
ground
neither
can
their
young
leave
the
nest
and
run
as
soon
as
they
are
out
of
the
egg
that
is
a
peculiarity
of
the
gallinaceous
tribe
of
birds
alone
to
which
then
these
must
belong
the
species
i
think
is
indicated
by
the
white
belly
and
dull
red
color
of
the
wing
coverts
which
i
observed
in
these
specimens
and
i
believe
them
to
be
bustards
especially
as
i
noticed
in
the
largest
the
fine
feathers
over
the
beak
peculiar
to
the
great
bustard
dear
boy
i
said
eyes
were
actively
employed
i
must
confess
if
your
fingers
were
unready
with
the
gun
and
after
all
it
is
just
as
well
perhaps
that
we
have
not
thrown
the
bustard
family
into
mourning
thus
chatting
we
at
length
approached
my
pretty
wood
numbers
of
birds
fluttered
and
sang
among
the
high
branches
but
i
did
not
encourage
the
boys
in
their
wish
to
try
to
shoot
any
of
the
happy
little
creatures
we
were
lost
in
admiration
of
the
trees
of
this
grove
and
i
can
not
describe
to
you
how
wonderful
they
are
nor
can
you
form
the
least
idea
of
their
enormous
size
without
seeing
them
yourself
what
we
had
been
calling
a
wood
proved
to
be
a
group
of
about
a
dozen
trees
only
and
what
was
strange
the
roots
sustained
the
massive
trunks
exalted
in
the
air
forming
strong
arches
and
props
and
stays
all
around
each
individual
stem
which
was
firmly
rooted
in
the
center
i
gave
jack
some
twine
and
scrambling
up
one
of
the
curious
roots
he
succeeded
in
measuring
round
the
trunk
itself
and
made
it
out
to
be
about
eighteen
yards
i
saw
no
sort
of
fruit
but
the
foliage
is
thick
and
abundant
throwing
delicious
shade
on
the
ground
beneath
which
is
carpeted
with
soft
green
herbage
and
entirely
free
from
thorns
briars
or
bushes
of
any
kind
it
is
the
most
charming
resting
place
that
ever
was
seen
and
i
and
the
boys
enjoyed
our
meal
immensely
in
this
glorious
palace
of
the
woods
so
grateful
to
our
senses
after
the
glare
and
heat
of
our
journey
thither
the
dogs
joined
us
after
a
while
they
had
lingered
behind
on
the
seashore
and
i
was
surprised
to
see
them
lie
down
and
go
comfortably
to
sleep
without
begging
for
food
as
they
do
usually
when
we
eat
the
longer
we
remained
in
this
enchanting
place
the
more
did
it
charm
my
fancy
and
if
we
could
but
manage
to
live
in
some
sort
of
dwelling
up
among
the
branches
of
those
grand
noble
trees
i
should
feel
perfectly
safe
and
happy
it
seemed
to
me
absurd
to
suppose
we
should
ever
find
another
place
half
so
lovely
so
i
determined
to
search
no
further
but
return
to
the
beach
and
see
if
anything
from
the
wreck
had
been
cast
up
by
the
waves
which
we
could
carry
away
with
us
before
starting
jack
persuaded
me
to
sit
quietly
a
little
longer
and
finish
making
his
belt
and
the
for
the
dogs
for
you
must
know
that
the
child
had
actually
been
carrying
the
board
on
which
these
were
stretched
all
this
time
so
that
they
should
get
the
full
benefit
of
the
sun
as
they
were
now
quite
dry
i
completed
them
easily
and
jack
girded
on
the
belt
with
great
pride
placing
his
pistols
in
it
and
marching
about
in
the
most
style
while
ernest
fitted
the
collars
on
the
two
dogs
on
reaching
the
shore
we
found
it
strewed
with
many
articles
doubtless
of
value
but
all
too
heavy
for
us
to
lift
we
rolled
some
casks
however
beyond
mark
and
dragged
a
chest
or
two
also
higher
on
the
beach
and
while
doing
so
observed
that
our
dogs
were
busy
among
the
rocks
they
were
carefully
watching
the
crevices
and
pools
and
every
now
and
then
would
pounce
downward
and
seize
something
which
they
swallowed
with
apparent
relish
are
eating
crabs
said
jack
wonder
they
have
not
seemed
hungry
lately
and
sure
enough
they
were
catching
the
little
green
crabs
with
which
the
water
abounded
these
however
did
not
apparently
entirely
satisfy
them
some
time
afterward
just
as
we
were
about
to
turn
inland
toward
the
ford
we
noticed
that
juno
was
scraping
in
the
sand
and
turning
up
some
round
substances
which
she
hastily
devoured
ernest
went
to
see
what
these
were
and
reported
in
his
calm
way
that
the
dog
had
found
eggs
cried
i
let
us
by
all
means
share
in
the
booty
juno
however
did
not
at
all
approve
of
this
and
it
was
with
some
difficulty
that
we
drove
her
aside
while
we
gathered
a
couple
of
dozen
of
eggs
stowing
them
in
our
provision
bags
while
thus
employed
we
caught
sight
of
a
sail
which
appeared
to
be
merrily
approaching
the
shore
beyond
the
cliffs
ernest
declared
it
must
be
our
raft
little
franz
always
having
the
fear
of
savages
before
his
eyes
began
to
look
frightened
and
for
a
moment
i
myself
was
doubtful
what
to
think
however
we
hastened
to
the
stream
and
crossing
it
by
the
came
in
sight
of
the
landing
place
where
we
joyfully
met
you
now
i
hope
you
approve
of
the
proceedings
of
your
exploring
party
and
that
you
will
do
me
the
favor
of
packing
everything
up
and
taking
us
away
to
live
among
my
splendid
trees
aye
little
wife
said
i
so
that
is
your
idea
of
comfort
and
security
is
it
a
tree
i
do
not
know
how
many
feet
high
on
which
we
are
to
perch
and
roost
like
the
birds
if
we
had
but
wings
or
a
balloon
it
would
i
own
be
a
capital
plan
laugh
as
much
as
you
like
returned
my
wife
my
idea
is
not
so
absurd
as
you
make
it
out
we
should
be
safe
up
there
from
jackals
visits
during
the
night
and
i
know
i
have
seen
at
home
in
switzerland
quite
a
pretty
arbor
with
a
strong
floor
up
among
the
branches
of
a
lime
tree
and
we
went
up
a
staircase
to
reach
it
why
could
not
we
contrive
a
place
like
that
where
we
could
sleep
safely
at
night
i
will
consider
the
idea
seriously
my
wife
said
i
perhaps
something
may
come
of
it
after
all
meantime
as
we
have
finished
our
supper
and
night
is
coming
on
let
us
commend
ourselves
to
almighty
protection
and
retire
to
rest
beneath
the
shelter
of
our
tent
we
all
slept
soundly
like
marmots
until
break
of
day
when
my
wife
and
i
awaking
took
counsel
together
as
to
future
proceedings
referring
to
the
task
she
had
the
previous
evening
proposed
for
me
i
remarked
that
to
undertake
it
would
involve
so
many
difficulties
that
it
was
highly
necessary
to
look
closely
into
the
subject
in
the
first
place
said
i
i
am
unwilling
hastily
to
quit
a
spot
to
which
i
am
convinced
we
were
providentially
led
as
a
landing
place
see
how
secure
it
is
guarded
on
all
sides
by
these
high
cliffs
and
accessible
only
by
the
narrow
passage
to
the
ford
while
from
this
point
it
is
so
easy
to
reach
the
ship
that
the
whole
of
its
valuable
cargo
is
at
our
disposal
suppose
we
decide
to
stay
patiently
here
for
the
present
until
at
least
we
have
brought
on
shore
everything
we
possibly
can
i
agree
with
you
to
a
certain
extent
dear
husband
replied
she
but
you
do
not
know
how
dreadfully
the
heat
among
the
rocks
tries
me
it
is
almost
intolerable
to
us
who
remain
here
all
day
while
you
and
fritz
are
away
out
at
sea
or
wandering
among
the
shady
woods
where
cool
fruits
refresh
and
fair
scenes
delight
you
as
to
the
contents
of
the
ship
an
immense
deal
has
been
cast
ashore
and
i
would
much
rather
give
up
all
the
remainder
and
be
spared
the
painful
anxiety
it
gives
me
when
you
even
talk
of
venturing
again
on
the
faithless
deep
well
i
must
admit
that
there
is
much
right
on
your
side
i
continued
suppose
we
were
to
remove
to
your
chosen
abode
and
make
this
rocky
fastness
our
magazine
and
place
of
retreat
in
case
of
danger
i
could
easily
render
it
still
more
secure
by
blasting
portions
of
the
rock
with
gunpowder
but
a
bridge
must
be
constructed
in
the
first
place
to
enable
us
to
cross
bag
and
baggage
oh
i
shall
be
parched
to
death
before
we
can
leave
this
place
if
a
bridge
has
to
be
made
cried
my
wife
impatiently
why
not
just
take
our
things
on
our
backs
and
wade
across
as
we
have
done
already
the
cow
and
the
donkey
could
carry
a
great
deal
that
they
will
have
to
do
in
whatever
fashion
we
make
the
move
said
i
but
bags
and
baskets
we
must
have
to
put
things
in
and
if
you
will
turn
your
attention
to
providing
those
i
will
set
about
the
bridge
at
once
it
will
be
wanted
not
once
but
continually
the
stream
will
probably
swell
and
be
impassable
at
times
and
even
as
it
is
an
accident
might
happen
well
well
cried
my
wife
i
submit
to
your
opinion
only
pray
set
about
it
without
delay
for
i
long
to
be
off
it
is
an
excellent
idea
to
make
a
strong
place
among
the
cliffs
here
the
gunpowder
especially
i
shall
be
delighted
to
see
stored
here
when
we
go
away
for
it
is
frightfully
dangerous
to
keep
so
much
as
we
have
close
to
our
habitation
gunpowder
is
indeed
the
most
dangerous
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
useful
thing
we
have
said
i
and
for
both
these
reasons
we
must
be
especially
careful
of
it
in
time
i
will
hollow
out
a
place
in
the
rock
where
we
can
store
it
safe
from
either
fire
or
damp
by
this
morning
consultation
we
had
settled
the
weighty
question
of
our
change
of
abode
and
also
chalked
out
work
for
the
day
when
the
children
heard
of
the
proposed
move
their
joy
was
boundless
they
began
at
once
to
talk
of
it
as
our
journey
to
the
promised
land
and
only
regretted
that
time
must
be
wasted
as
they
said
in
before
it
could
be
undertaken
everyone
being
impatient
for
breakfast
that
work
might
be
begun
at
once
the
cow
and
goats
were
milked
and
having
enjoyed
a
comfortable
meal
of
biscuit
boiled
in
milk
i
prepared
to
start
for
the
wreck
in
order
to
obtain
planks
for
the
proposed
bridge
ernest
as
well
as
fritz
accompanied
me
and
we
were
soon
within
the
influence
of
the
current
and
were
carried
swiftly
out
to
sea
fritz
was
steering
and
we
had
no
sooner
passed
beyond
the
islet
at
the
entrance
of
the
bay
so
as
to
come
in
sight
of
its
seaward
beach
than
we
were
astonished
to
see
a
countless
multitude
of
sea
birds
gulls
and
others
which
rose
like
a
cloud
into
the
air
disturbed
by
our
approach
and
deafened
us
by
their
wild
and
screaming
cries
fritz
caught
up
his
gun
and
would
have
sent
a
shot
among
them
had
i
permitted
it
i
was
very
curious
to
find
out
what
could
be
the
great
attraction
for
all
this
swarm
of
feathered
fowl
and
availing
myself
of
a
fresh
breeze
from
the
sea
i
set
the
sail
and
directed
our
course
toward
the
island
the
swelling
sail
and
flying
pennant
charmed
ernest
while
fritz
bent
his
keen
eyes
eagerly
toward
the
sandy
shore
where
the
flocks
of
birds
were
again
settling
presently
he
shouted
aha
now
i
see
what
they
are
after
they
have
a
huge
monster
of
a
fish
there
and
a
proper
feast
they
are
making
have
a
nearer
look
at
it
father
we
could
not
take
our
boat
very
close
in
but
we
managed
to
effect
a
landing
at
a
short
distance
from
the
festive
scene
and
securing
the
raft
by
casting
a
rope
round
a
large
stone
we
cautiously
drew
near
the
object
of
interest
it
proved
to
be
a
monstrous
fish
on
whose
flesh
these
multitudes
of
birds
were
ravenously
feeding
and
it
was
extraordinary
to
watch
the
ferocity
the
envy
the
gluttony
and
all
manner
of
evil
passions
exhibited
among
the
guests
at
this
banquet
there
was
nothing
on
this
sandy
beach
when
we
passed
yesterday
i
am
certain
father
said
fritz
it
seems
strange
to
see
this
creature
stranded
here
why
fritz
cried
ernest
it
must
be
the
shark
your
shark
you
know
i
believe
i
can
see
where
you
hit
him
in
the
head
you
are
right
i
do
believe
ernest
said
i
though
i
think
your
imagination
only
can
distinguish
the
gunshot
wounds
among
all
the
pecking
and
tearing
of
the
voracious
birds
there
just
look
boys
at
those
terrific
jaws
beneath
the
strangely
projecting
snout
see
the
rows
upon
rows
of
murderous
teeth
and
thank
god
we
were
delivered
from
them
let
us
try
if
we
can
induce
these
greedy
birds
to
spare
us
a
bit
of
the
shark
skin
it
is
extremely
rough
and
when
dry
may
be
used
like
a
file
ernest
drew
the
ramrod
from
his
gun
and
charged
so
manfully
into
the
crowd
that
striking
right
and
left
he
speedily
killed
several
while
most
of
the
others
took
to
flight
fritz
detached
some
broad
strips
of
skin
with
his
knife
and
we
returned
toward
the
boat
perceiving
with
satisfaction
that
the
shore
was
strewn
with
just
the
sort
of
boards
and
planks
i
wanted
i
lost
no
time
in
collecting
them
and
forming
a
raft
to
tow
after
us
we
were
in
a
short
time
able
to
direct
our
course
homeward
without
visiting
the
wreck
at
all
as
we
sailed
along
extremely
well
pleased
with
our
good
fortune
fritz
by
my
direction
nailed
part
of
the
shark
skin
flat
on
boards
to
dry
in
the
sun
and
the
rest
on
the
rounded
mast
will
that
be
a
good
plan
father
inquired
he
it
will
be
quite
bent
and
crooked
when
it
hardens
that
it
just
what
i
want
it
to
be
said
i
we
may
happen
to
find
it
useful
in
that
form
as
well
as
flat
it
would
be
beautiful
shagreen
if
we
could
smooth
and
polish
it
i
thought
remarked
ernest
that
shagreen
was
made
from
asses
hide
and
you
thought
rightly
said
i
the
best
shagreen
is
prepared
in
turkey
persia
and
tartary
from
the
skins
of
horses
and
asses
in
these
skins
the
roughness
is
produced
artificially
while
the
skin
is
newly
flayed
and
still
soft
hard
grains
of
corn
are
spread
on
the
under
surface
and
pressed
into
it
as
it
dries
these
grains
are
afterward
removed
and
the
roughness
imparted
to
the
appearance
of
the
skin
remains
indelibly
shagreen
is
useful
in
polishing
joiners
work
and
it
is
made
in
france
from
the
rough
skin
of
a
hideous
creature
called
the
exclaimed
fritz
what
a
name
to
give
to
anything
father
there
are
bad
angels
as
well
as
good
ones
observed
ernest
in
his
dry
quiet
way
it
is
better
to
leave
people
to
see
for
themselves
which
is
meant
by
this
time
we
were
close
in
shore
and
lowering
the
sail
we
soon
had
our
craft
with
the
raft
in
tow
safely
moored
to
the
bank
no
one
was
in
sight
not
a
sound
to
be
heard
so
with
united
voice
we
gave
a
loud
cheery
halloo
which
after
a
while
was
answered
in
shrill
tones
and
the
mother
with
her
two
boys
came
running
from
behind
the
rocks
between
us
and
the
stream
each
carrying
a
small
bundle
in
a
handkerchief
while
little
franz
held
aloft
a
landing
net
our
return
so
soon
was
quite
unexpected
and
they
anxiously
inquired
the
reason
which
we
soon
explained
and
then
the
mysterious
bundles
were
opened
and
a
great
number
of
fine
crawfish
displayed
whose
efforts
to
escape
by
scuttling
away
in
every
direction
directly
they
were
placed
in
a
heap
on
the
ground
caused
immense
fun
and
laughter
as
the
boys
pursued
and
brought
them
back
only
to
find
others
scrambling
off
in
a
dozen
different
ways
now
father
have
we
not
done
well
cried
jack
did
you
ever
see
such
splendid
crawfish
oh
there
were
thousands
of
them
and
i
am
sure
we
have
got
two
hundred
here
at
least
just
look
at
their
claws
no
doubt
you
were
the
discoverer
of
these
fine
crabs
eh
jack
said
i
no
fancy
young
franz
being
the
lucky
man
answered
he
he
and
i
went
toward
the
stream
while
mother
was
busy
just
to
look
for
a
good
place
for
the
bridge
franz
was
picking
up
pebbles
and
alabasters
some
because
they
were
so
pretty
some
to
strike
sparks
in
the
dark
and
some
he
insisted
were
cried
he
presently
and
see
the
crabs
on
fritz
jackal
you
know
we
threw
it
away
there
and
to
be
sure
it
was
swarming
with
these
creatures
are
you
glad
we
have
found
them
father
will
they
be
good
to
eat
very
excellent
my
boy
and
we
may
be
thankful
that
food
for
our
wants
is
thus
provided
day
by
day
when
each
party
had
related
the
day
adventures
and
while
the
mother
was
cooking
the
crawfish
we
went
to
bring
our
store
of
planks
to
land
even
this
apparently
simple
operation
required
thought
and
i
had
to
improvise
for
the
cow
and
the
donkey
by
which
we
could
make
them
drag
each
board
separately
from
the
water
edge
to
the
margin
of
the
stream
jack
showed
me
where
he
thought
the
bridge
should
be
and
i
certainly
saw
no
better
place
as
the
banks
were
at
that
point
tolerably
close
to
one
another
steep
and
of
about
equal
height
how
shall
we
find
out
if
our
planks
are
long
enough
to
reach
across
said
i
a
surveyor
table
would
be
useful
now
what
do
you
say
to
a
ball
of
string
father
said
ernest
tie
one
end
to
a
stone
throw
it
across
then
draw
it
back
and
measure
the
line
adopting
my
son
idea
we
speedily
ascertained
the
distance
across
to
be
eighteen
feet
then
allowing
three
feet
more
at
each
side
i
calculated
feet
as
the
necessary
length
of
the
boards
the
question
as
to
how
the
planks
were
to
be
laid
across
was
a
difficult
one
we
resolved
to
discuss
it
during
dinner
to
which
we
were
now
summoned
and
my
wife
as
we
sat
resting
displayed
to
me
her
needlework
with
hard
labor
she
had
made
two
large
canvas
bags
for
the
ass
to
carry
having
no
suitable
needle
she
had
been
obliged
to
bore
the
hole
for
each
stitch
with
a
nail
and
gained
great
praise
for
her
ingenuity
and
patience
dinner
was
quickly
dispatched
as
we
were
all
eager
to
continue
our
engineering
work
a
scheme
had
occurred
to
me
for
conveying
one
end
of
a
plank
across
the
water
and
i
set
about
it
in
this
way
there
fortunately
were
one
or
two
trees
close
to
the
stream
on
either
side
i
attached
a
rope
pretty
near
one
end
of
a
beam
and
slung
it
loosely
to
the
tree
beside
us
then
fastening
a
long
rope
to
the
other
end
i
crossed
with
it
by
means
of
broken
rocks
and
stones
and
having
a
pulley
and
block
i
soon
arranged
the
rope
on
a
strong
limb
of
the
opposite
tree
again
returning
with
the
end
to
our
own
side
now
putting
my
idea
to
the
proof
i
brought
the
ass
and
the
cow
and
fastening
this
rope
to
the
harness
i
had
previously
contrived
for
them
i
drove
them
steadily
away
from
the
bank
to
my
great
satisfaction
and
the
surprise
and
delight
of
the
boys
the
end
of
the
plank
which
had
been
laid
alongside
the
stream
began
gently
to
move
rose
higher
turned
and
soon
projecting
over
the
water
continued
to
advance
until
having
described
the
segment
of
a
circle
it
reached
the
opposite
bank
i
stopped
my
team
the
plank
rested
on
the
ground
the
bridge
was
made
so
at
least
thought
fritz
and
jack
who
in
a
moment
were
lightly
running
across
the
narrow
way
shouting
joyfully
as
they
sprang
to
the
other
side
our
work
was
now
comparatively
easy
a
second
and
third
plank
were
laid
beside
the
first
and
when
these
were
carefully
secured
at
each
end
to
the
ground
and
to
the
trees
we
very
quickly
laid
short
boards
side
by
side
across
the
beams
the
boys
nailing
them
lightly
down
as
i
sawed
them
in
lengths
and
when
this
was
done
our
bridge
was
pronounced
complete
nothing
could
exceed
the
excitement
of
the
children
they
danced
to
and
fro
on
the
wonderful
structure
singing
shouting
and
cutting
the
wildest
capers
i
must
confess
i
heartily
sympathized
with
their
triumphant
feelings
now
that
the
work
was
done
we
began
to
feel
how
much
we
were
fatigued
and
gladly
returned
to
our
tent
for
refreshment
and
repose
next
morning
while
we
breakfasted
i
made
a
little
speech
to
my
sons
on
the
subject
of
the
important
move
we
were
about
to
make
wishing
to
impress
them
with
a
sense
of
the
absolute
necessity
of
great
caution
remember
said
i
that
although
you
all
begin
to
feel
very
much
at
your
ease
here
we
are
yet
complete
strangers
to
a
variety
of
dangers
which
may
surprise
us
unawares
i
charge
you
therefore
to
maintain
good
order
and
keep
together
on
the
march
no
darting
off
into
jack
no
lingering
behind
to
philosophize
ernest
and
now
all
hands
to
work
the
greatest
activity
instantly
prevailed
in
our
camp
some
collected
provisions
others
packed
kitchen
utensils
tools
ropes
and
hammocks
arranging
them
as
burdens
for
the
cow
and
ass
my
wife
pleaded
for
a
seat
on
the
latter
for
her
little
franz
and
assuring
me
likewise
that
she
could
not
possibly
leave
the
poultry
even
for
a
night
nor
exist
an
hour
without
her
magic
bag
i
agreed
to
do
my
best
to
please
her
without
downright
cruelty
to
animals
away
ran
the
children
to
catch
the
cocks
and
hens
great
chasing
fluttering
and
cackling
ensued
but
with
no
success
whatever
until
the
mother
recalled
her
panting
sons
and
scattering
some
handfuls
of
grain
within
the
open
tent
soon
decoyed
the
fowls
and
pigeons
into
the
enclosure
where
when
the
curtain
was
dropped
they
were
easily
caught
tied
together
and
placed
on
the
cow
this
amiable
and
phlegmatic
animal
had
stood
calmly
chewing
the
cud
while
package
after
package
was
disposed
on
her
broad
back
nor
did
she
now
object
even
to
this
noisy
addition
to
her
load
i
placed
a
couple
of
over
all
and
spreading
sailcloth
on
them
put
the
fowls
in
darkness
and
they
rapidly
became
quiet
and
the
cow
with
the
appearance
of
having
a
small
wagon
on
her
back
was
ready
to
start
franz
was
firmly
seated
on
the
ass
amidst
bags
and
bundles
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
they
rose
about
him
like
cushions
and
pillows
and
his
curly
head
rested
on
the
precious
magic
bag
which
surmounted
all
the
rest
having
filled
the
tent
with
the
things
we
left
behind
closing
it
carefully
and
ranging
chests
and
casks
around
it
we
were
finally
ready
to
be
off
each
well
equipped
and
in
the
highest
spirits
fritz
and
his
mother
led
the
van
franz
the
young
cavalier
and
the
cow
followed
them
closely
jack
conducted
the
goats
one
of
these
had
also
a
rider
for
knips
the
monkey
was
seated
on
his
whose
patience
was
sorely
tried
by
his
restlessness
and
playful
tricks

a

the
sheep
were
under
ernest
care
and
i
brought
up
the
rear
of
this
patriarchal
band
while
the
two
dogs
kept
constantly
running
backward
and
forward
in
the
character
of
we
seem
delightfully
like
those
simple
and
pastoral
tribes
i
have
read
of
said
ernest
as
we
proceeded
whose
whole
lives
are
spent
in
shifting
from
place
to
place
without
any
wish

settle
yes
said
i
among
the
arabs
tartars
and
some
other
eastern
nations
this
mode
of
life
is
natural
they
for
that
reason
are
called
nomads
these
tribes
are
amply
provided
with
camels
and
horses
and
effect
their
journeys
more
quickly
and
conveniently
than
we
are
likely
to
do
with
these
deliberate
quadrupeds
of
ours
whatever
you
young
folks
may
think
i
suspect
your
mother
and
i
will
be
quite
satisfied
with
one
such
undertaking
at
least
i
hope
she
will
be
contented
with
the
nest
she
intends
me
to
build
for
her
up
in
her
wonderful
trees
with
honest
pride
i
introduced
my
wife
to
my
bridge
and
after
receiving
from
her
what
i
considered
praise
for
my
skill
in
its
construction
we
passed
over
it
in
grand
procession
unexpectedly
on
the
opposite
side
by
the
arrival
of
our
old
sow
the
perverse
creature
had
obstinately
resisted
our
attempts
to
bring
her
with
us
but
finding
herself
deserted
had
followed
of
her
own
accord
testifying
in
the
most
unmistakable
manner
by
angry
grunts
and
squeals
her
entire
disapproval
of
our
proceedings
i
soon
found
we
must
as
before
turn
down
to
the
sea
beach
for
not
only
did
the
rank
grass
impede
our
progress
but
it
also
tempted
the
animals
to
break
away
from
us
and
but
for
our
watchful
dogs
we
might
have
lost
several
of
them
on
the
firm
open
sands
we
were
making
good
way
when
to
my
annoyance
both
our
dogs
suddenly
left
us
and
springing
into
the
thick
cover
to
our
right
commenced
a
furious
barking
followed
by
howling
as
if
in
fear
and
violent
pain
not
for
a
moment
doubting
that
some
dangerous
animal
was
at
hand
i
hastened
to
the
spot
remarking
as
i
went
the
characteristic
behavior
of
my
three
sons
fritz
cocked
his
gun
and
advanced
boldly
but
with
caution
ernest
looked
disconcerted
and
drew
back
but
got
ready
to
fire
while
jack
hurried
after
fritz
without
so
much
as
unslinging
his
gun
from
his
shoulders
before
i
could
come
up
with
them
i
heard
jack
shouting
excitedly
father
father
come
quickly
a
huge
porcupine
a
most
enormous
porcupine
sure
enough
the
dogs
were
rushing
round
and
round
a
porcupine
and
having
attempted
to
seize
it
were
already
severely
wounded
by
its
quills
each
time
they
came
near
the
creature
with
a
rattling
noise
bristled
up
its
spines
somewhat
to
my
amusement
while
we
were
looking
at
the
curious
defense
this
creature
was
making
little
jack
stepped
close
up
to
it
with
a
pocket
pistol
in
his
hand
and
shot
it
dead
making
sure
of
it
by
a
couple
of
hearty
raps
on
the
head
and
then
giving
way
to
a
burst
of
boyish
exultation
he
called
upon
us
to
help
convey
his
prize
to
his
mother
this
it
was
not
by
any
means
easy
to
do
sundry
attempts
resulted
in
bloody
fingers
till
jack
taking
his
pocket
handkerchief
and
fastening
one
corner
round
its
neck
ran
off
dragging
it
after
him
to
where
his
mother
awaited
us
hullo
mother
here
a
jolly
beast
is
it
i
shot
it
and
it
good
to
eat
father
says
so
i
only
wish
you
had
seen
how
it
terrified
the
dogs
and
heard
the
rattling
and
rustling
of
its
spines
oh
it
is
a
fearful
creature
ernest
examining
it
carefully
pronounced
its
incisor
teeth
its
ears
and
feet
to
resemble
those
of
the
human
race
and
pointed
out
the
curious
crest
of
stiff
hairs
on
its
head
and
neck
i
have
read
of
another
species
said
he
called
the
porcupine
which
must
be
even
more
curious
looking
than
this
is
it
has
short
flat
quills
and
a
scaly
tail
ending
in
an
extraordinary
tuft
like
a
bunch
of
narrow
strips
of
parchment
it
can
not
be
such
a
disagreeable
enemy
to
encounter
as
this
fellow
were
you
not
afraid
jack
asked
i
lest
the
porcupine
should
cast
some
of
his
quills
like
darts
at
you
of
course
not
returned
he
i
know
well
enough
that
is
nothing
but
a
fable
a
fable
said
i
why
look
at
your
mother
she
is
drawing
five
or
six
spines
out
of
each
of
the
dogs
ah
those
stuck
into
them
when
they
so
fiercely
fell
upon
it
in
their
attack
those
are
the
shortest
quills
and
seem
very
slightly
fixed
in
its
skin
the
long
quills
bent
aside
when
juno
pressed
against
them
you
are
perfectly
right
my
boy
said
i
there
is
no
truth
in
the
old
idea
of
shooting
out
the
spines
but
now
shall
we
leave
this
prickly
booty
of
yours
or
attempt
to
take
it
with
us
oh
please
father
let
us
take
it
why
it
is
good
to
eat
smiling
at
the
child
eagerness
and
willing
to
please
him
i
made
a
somewhat
awkward
bundle
of
the
porcupine
wrapping
it
in
several
folds
of
cloth
and
added
it
to
the
donkey
load
we
had
scarcely
started
when
the
porcupine
quills
entered
the
donkey
back
causing
it
to
kick
and
plunge
this
i
soon
altered
and
our
party
then
resumed
the
march
which
with
little
interruption
was
continued
steadily
until
we
came
in
sight
of
our
future
place
of
residence
the
wonderful
appearance
of
the
enormous
trees
and
the
calm
beauty
of
the
spot
altogether
fully
came
up
to
the
enthusiastic
description
which
had
been
given
me
and
my
wife
gladly
heard
me
say
that
if
an
abode
could
be
contrived
among
the
branches
it
would
be
the
safest
and
most
charming
home
in
the
world
we
hastily
unloaded
the
ass
and
cow
securing
them
as
well
as
the
sheep
and
goats
by
tying
their
loosely
together
the
doves
and
poultry
were
set
at
liberty
and
we
sat
down
to
rest
among
the
soft
herbage
while
we
laid
our
plans
for
the
night
fritz
soon
left
us
but
presently
two
shots
were
fired
and
he
appeared
holding
a
fine
tiger
cat
by
the
hind
legs
which
with
the
intensest
delight
he
exhibited
to
each
in
turn
well
done
fritz
cried
i
our
cocks
and
hens
would
have
had
an
unfortunate
night
of
it
but
for
this
lucky
shot
of
yours
it
is
to
be
hoped
he
has
left
no
companion
near
at
hand
you
must
be
on
the
lookout
how
curious
it
seems
remarked
ernest
that
god
should
create
hurtful
animals
like
this
to
our
feeble
and
narrow
vision
many
of
the
ways
of
the
infinite
and
eternal
mind
are
incomprehensible
i
replied
what
our
limited
reason
can
not
grasp
let
us
be
content
to
acknowledge
as
the
workings
of
almighty
power
and
wisdom
and
thankfully
trust
in
that
which
were
it
not
higher
than
we
would
afford
no
sense
of
security
to
the
immortal
soul
that
animals
should
prey
upon
one
another
is
a
means
of
preserving
a
due
balance
in
the
world
of
nature
and
in
many
ways
these
beasts
of
prey
are
also
useful
to
man
what
beautiful
and
warm
furs
are
procured
by
hunters
just
in
those
countries
where
no
other
covering
would
defend
the
inhabitants
from
the
wintry
cold
as
for
instance
the
skins
of
bears
wolverines
and
arctic
foxes
wild
cats
and
many
others
the
skin
of
the
seal
or
sea
dog
is
also
valuable
said
ernest
it
is
i
replied
and
in
its
own
element
that
creature
preys
on
fish
as
the
dog
did
on
land
animals
before
his
race
became
domesticated
by
man
but
now
fritz
tell
us
how
you
obtained
your
prize
observing
that
something
moved
among
the
branches
said
he
i
went
softly
around
the
tree
with
my
gun
and
making
sure
the
creature
was
a
wild
cat
i
fired
and
brought
it
down
it
was
severely
wounded
but
rising
in
a
fury
it
attempted
to
climb
the
tree
when
i
luckily
having
a
loaded
pistol
gave
it
a
quietus
and
do
tell
me
father
what
sort
of
a
cat
it
is
it
is
a
mercy
the
brute
did
not
fly
at
your
throat
instead
of
attempting
to
escape
said
i
it
belongs
to
a
fierce
and
race
that
of
the
ocelots
or
tiger
cats
natives
of
the
tropical
parts
of
america
i
should
say
this
was
a
margay
and
it
would
have
proved
a
cruel
foe
not
only
of
our
poultry
but
also
of
our
sheep
and
goats
i
am
well
pleased
that
you
have
rid
us
of
it
may
i
have
the
beautiful
skin
father
and
will
you
tell
me
what
will
be
the
best
use
to
make
of
it
i
advise
you
to
skin
the
animal
very
carefully
and
of
the
handsome
black
and
yellow
tail
make
a
for
yourself
the
paws
let
me
see
why
i
fancy
the
paws
might
be
made
into
famous
cases
for
knife
fork
and
spoon
and
look
well
hanging
from
the
belt
the
skin
of
the
body
you
had
better
preserve
until
you
find
some
suitable
use
for
it
oh
father
what
a
splendid
plan
cried
jack
do
tell
me
some
good
use
for
my
porcupine
i
think
its
feet
may
make
cases
also
at
least
you
may
try
the
quills
i
am
sure
may
be
used
for
packing
needles
and
for
tipping
arrows
and
i
should
try
to
make
defensive
armor
for
the
dogs
out
of
the
rest
they
may
fall
in
with
foes
more
dangerous
than
any
we
have
yet
seen
to
be
sure
father
the
very
thing
shouted
jack
in
high
glee
i
have
seen
pictures
of
boar
hunts
in
which
the
dogs
were
protected
by
a
sort
of
leather
coat
of
mail
that
will
be
grand
after
giving
this
advice
i
got
no
peace
until
i
had
shown
my
boys
how
to
act
upon
it
and
in
a
short
time
each
had
his
prize
fastened
up
by
the
hind
legs
and
carefully
slitting
the
skin
was
stripping
it
from
the
carcass
ernest
meanwhile
was
fetching
large
flat
stones
in
order
to
form
a
fireplace
while
franz
gathered
sticks
as
his
mother
was
anxious
to
prepare
some
food
what
sort
of
a
tree
do
you
suppose
this
to
be
father
inquired
ernest
seeing
me
examining
that
under
which
we
were
encamping
is
not
the
leaf
something
like
a
walnut
there
is
a
resemblance
but
in
my
opinion
these
gigantic
trees
must
be
mangroves
or
wild
figs
i
have
heard
their
enormous
height
described
and
also
the
peculiarity
of
the
arching
roots
supporting
the
main
trunk
raised
above
the
soil
just
then
little
franz
came
up
with
a
large
bundle
of
sticks
and
his
mouth
full
of
something
he
was
eating
with
evident
satisfaction
oh
mother
cried
he
this
is
so
good
so
delicious
greedy
little
boy
exclaimed
she
in
a
fright
what
have
you
got
there
do
swallow
it
whatever
you
do
very
likely
it
is
poisonous
spit
it
all
out
this
minute
and
the
anxious
mother
quickly
extracted
from
the
rosy
little
mouth
the
remains
of
a
small
fig
where
did
you
find
this
said
i
there
are
thousands
lying
among
the
grass
yonder
replied
the
little
boy
they
taste
very
nice
i
thought
poison
was
nasty
do
you
think
they
will
hurt
me
the
pigeons
and
the
hens
are
gobbling
them
up
with
all
their
might
and
main
papa
i
think
you
have
no
cause
for
alarm
dear
wife
i
said
the
trees
seem
to
be
the
mangrove
of
the
antilles
but
remember
franz
you
must
never
eat
anything
without
first
showing
it
to
me
never
mind
how
good
it
seems
if
birds
and
monkeys
eat
a
fruit
or
vegetable
it
is
usually
safe
to
believe
it
wholesome
added
i
turning
to
the
other
boys
who
instantly
taking
the
hint
coaxed
franz
to
give
them
the
figs
he
still
had
in
his
pocket
and
ran
to
offer
them
to
knips
who
was
closely
watching
the
skinning
of
the
tiger
cat
and
porcupine
apparently
giving
his
opinion
on
the
subject
with
much
chattering
and
gesticulation
here
knips
allow
me
to
present
you
with
a
fig
cried
jack
holding
one
out
to
the
funny
little
creature
knips
took
it
readily
and
after
turning
it
about
and
sniffing
and
smelling
it
he
popped
it
into
his
mouth
with
such
a
droll
grimace
of
delight
and
satisfaction
that
the
boys
all
laughed
and
clapped
their
hands
crying
bravo
knips
you
know
a
good
thing
when
you
see
it
do
you
old
fellow
hurrah
my
wife
with
her
mind
set
at
rest
on
the
question
of
the
figs
now
continued
her
preparations
for
dinner
the
flesh
of
the
margay
was
given
to
the
dogs
but
part
of
the
porcupine
was
put
on
the
fire
to
boil
while
we
reserved
the
rest
for
roasting
i
employed
myself
in
contriving
needles
for
my
wife
work
by
boring
holes
at
one
end
of
the
quills
which
i
did
by
means
of
a
red
hot
nail
and
i
soon
had
a
nice
packet
of
various
sizes
which
pleased
her
immensely
i
also
laid
plans
for
making
proper
harness
for
our
beasts
of
burden
but
could
not
attempt
to
begin
that
while
so
many
wants
more
pressing
demanded
attention
we
examined
the
different
trees
and
chose
one
which
seemed
most
suited
to
our
purpose
the
branches
spread
at
a
great
height
above
us
and
i
made
the
boys
try
if
it
were
possible
to
throw
sticks
or
stones
over
one
of
these
my
intention
being
to
construct
a
rope
ladder
if
we
could
once
succeed
in
getting
a
string
across
a
strong
bough
finding
we
could
not
succeed
in
that
way
i
revolved
other
schemes
in
my
mind
and
meantime
went
with
jack
and
fritz
to
a
small
brook
close
by
where
i
showed
them
how
to
place
the
skins
to
steep
and
soften
in
the
water
with
stones
placed
on
them
to
keep
them
beneath
the
surface
when
dinner
was
over
i
prepared
our
night
quarters
i
first
slung
our
hammocks
from
the
roots
of
the
tree
which
meeting
above
us
formed
an
arched
roof
then
covering
the
whole
with
sailcloth
we
made
a
temporary
tent
which
would
at
least
keep
off
the
night
damps
and
noxious
insects
leaving
my
wife
engaged
in
making
a
set
of
harness
for
the
ass
and
cow
whose
strength
i
intended
to
employ
the
following
day
in
drawing
the
beams
up
to
our
tree
i
walked
down
with
fritz
and
ernest
to
the
beach
to
look
for
wood
suitable
for
building
our
new
abode
and
also
to
discover
if
possible
some
light
rods
to
form
a
ladder
for
some
time
we
hunted
in
vain
nothing
but
rough
drift
wood
was
to
be
seen
utterly
unfit
for
our
purpose
ernest
at
length
pointed
out
a
quantity
of
bamboos
half
buried
in
the
sand
these
were
exactly
what
i
wanted
and
stripping
them
of
their
leaves
i
cut
them
into
lengths
of
about
five
feet
each
these
i
bound
in
bundles
to
carry
to
the
tree
and
then
began
to
look
about
for
some
slight
reeds
to
serve
as
arrows
i
presently
saw
what
i
required
in
a
copse
at
a
little
distance
we
advanced
cautiously
lest
the
thicket
should
contain
some
wild
beast
or
venomous
serpent
juno
rushed
ahead
as
she
did
so
a
flock
of
flamingoes
which
had
been
quietly
feeding
rose
in
the
air
fritz
instantly
firing
brought
a
couple
of
the
birds
to
the
ground
the
rest
of
the
squadron
sailing
away
in
perfect
order
their
plumage
continually
changing
as
they
flew
from
beautiful
rose
to
pure
white
as
alternately
their
snowy
wings
and
rosy
breasts
were
visible
one
of
those
which
fell
was
perfectly
dead
but
the
other
appeared
only
slightly
wounded
in
the
wing
for
it
made
off
across
the
swampy
ground
i
attempted
to
follow
but
soon
found
that
progress
was
impossible
on
the
marsh
juno
however
chased
the
bird
and
seizing
it
speedily
brought
it
to
my
feet
fritz
and
ernest
were
delighted
at
the
sight
of
our
prize
what
a
handsome
bird
exclaimed
they
is
it
much
hurt
let
us
tame
it
and
let
it
run
about
with
the
fowls
its
plumage
is
much
more
brilliant
than
that
of
the
dead
one
remarked
fritz
yes
said
ernest
this
is
a
full
grown
bird
while
yours
is
younger
it
is
some
years
before
they
reach
perfection
see
what
long
active
legs
it
has
like
those
of
a
stork
while
with
its
great
webbed
feet
it
can
swim
faster
than
a
goose
earth
air
or
water
is
all
the
same
to
the
flamingo
it
is
equally
at
home
in
any
one
of
the
three
well
said
fritz
let
us
take
the
dead
one
to
mother
and
get
her
to
introduce
it
to
the
other
element
and
see
what
it
will
make
of
that
if
it
is
young
and
tender
as
you
say
it
should
make
a
delicious
roast
fritz
and
ernest
then
carried
the
birds
and
bamboos
to
the
tree
while
i
proceeded
to
cut
my
reeds
i
chose
those
which
had
flowered
knowing
that
they
were
harder
and
having
cut
a
sufficient
quantity
of
these
i
selected
one
or
two
of
the
tallest
canes
i
could
find
to
assist
me
in
measuring
the
height
of
the
tree
i
then
bound
them
together
and
returned
to
my
family
do
you
mean
to
keep
this
great
hungry
bird
fritz
has
brought
said
my
wife
it
is
another
mouth
to
feed
remember
and
provisions
are
still
scarce
luckily
i
replied
the
flamingo
will
not
eat
grain
like
our
poultry
but
will
be
quite
satisfied
with
insects
fish
and
little
crabs
which
it
will
pick
up
for
itself
pray
reassure
yourself
therefore
and
let
me
see
to
the
poor
bird
wound
so
saying
i
procured
some
wine
and
butter
and
anointed
the
wing
which
though
hurt
was
not
broken
i
bound
it
up
and
then
took
the
bird
to
the
stream
where
i
fastened
it
by
a
long
cord
to
a
stake
and
left
it
to
shift
for
itself
in
a
few
days
the
wound
was
healed
and
the
bird
subdued
by
kind
treatment
became
rapidly
tame
while
i
was
thus
employed
my
sons
were
endeavoring
to
ascertain
the
height
of
the
lowest
branch
of
the
tree
from
the
ground
they
had
fastened
together
the
long
reeds
i
had
brought
and
were
trying
to
measure
the
distance
with
them
but
in
vain
they
soon
found
that
were
the
rods
ten
times
their
length
they
could
not
touch
the
branch
hullo
my
boys
i
said
when
i
discovered
what
they
were
about
that
is
not
the
way
to
set
to
work
geometry
will
simplify
the
operation
considerably
with
its
help
the
altitude
of
the
highest
mountains
are
ascertained
we
may
therefore
easily
find
the
height
of
the
branch
so
saying
i
measured
out
a
certain
distance
from
the
base
of
the
tree
and
marked
the
spot
and
then
by
means
of
a
rod
whose
length
i
knew
and
imaginary
lines
i
calculated
the
angle
subtended
by
the
trunk
of
the
tree
from
the
ground
to
the
root
of
the
branch
this
done
i
was
able
to
discover
the
height
required
and
to
the
astonishment
of
the
younger
children
announced
that
we
should
henceforth
live
thirty
feet
above
the
ground
this
i
wanted
to
know
that
i
might
construct
a
ladder
of
the
necessary
length
telling
fritz
to
collect
all
our
cord
and
the
others
to
roll
all
the
twine
into
a
ball
i
sat
down
and
taking
the
reeds
speedily
manufactured
half
a
dozen
arrows
and
feathered
them
from
the
dead
flamingo
i
then
took
a
strong
bamboo
bent
it
and
strung
it
so
as
to
form
a
bow
when
the
boys
saw
what
i
had
done
they
were
delighted
and
begged
to
have
the
pleasure
of
firing
the
first
shot
no
no
said
i
i
did
not
make
this
for
mere
pleasure
nor
is
it
even
intended
as
a
weapon
the
arrows
are
pointless
elizabeth
i
continued
to
my
wife
can
you
supply
me
with
a
ball
of
stout
thread
from
your
wonderful
bag
certainly
replied
she
i
think
a
ball
of
thread
was
the
first
thing
to
enter
the
bag
and
diving
her
hand
deep
in
she
drew
out
the
very
thing
i
wanted
now
boys
i
said
i
am
going
to
fire
the
first
shot
and
i
fastened
one
end
of
the
thread
to
one
of
my
arrows
and
aimed
at
a
large
branch
above
me
the
arrow
flew
upward
and
bore
the
thread
over
the
branch
and
fell
at
our
feet
thus
was
the
first
step
in
our
undertaking
accomplished
now
for
the
rope
ladder
fritz
had
obtained
two
coils
of
cord
each
about
forty
feet
in
length
these
we
stretched
on
the
ground
side
by
side
then
fritz
cut
the
bamboos
into
pieces
of
two
feet
for
the
steps
of
the
ladder
and
as
he
handed
them
to
me
i
passed
them
through
knots
which
i
had
prepared
in
the
ropes
while
jack
fixed
each
end
with
a
nail
driven
through
the
wood
when
the
ladder
was
finished
i
carried
over
the
bough
a
rope
by
which
it
might
be
hauled
up
this
done
i
fixed
the
lower
end
of
the
ladder
firmly
to
the
ground
by
means
of
stakes
and
all
was
ready
for
an
ascent
the
boys
who
had
been
watching
me
with
intense
interest
were
each
eager
to
be
first
jack
shall
have
the
honor
said
i
as
he
is
the
lightest
so
up
with
you
my
boy
and
do
not
break
your
neck
jack
who
was
as
active
as
a
monkey
sprang
up
the
ladder
and
quickly
gained
the
top
three
cheers
for
the
nest
he
exclaimed
waving
his
cap
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
for
our
jolly
nest
what
a
grand
house
we
will
have
up
here
come
along
fritz
his
brother
was
soon
by
his
side
and
with
a
hammer
and
nails
secured
the
ladder
yet
more
securely
i
followed
with
an
ax
and
took
a
survey
of
the
tree
it
was
admirably
suited
to
our
purpose
the
branches
were
very
strong
and
so
closely
interwoven
that
no
beams
would
be
required
to
form
a
flooring
but
when
some
of
the
boughs
were
lopped
and
cleared
away
a
few
planks
would
be
quite
sufficient
i
now
called
for
a
pulley
which
my
wife
fastened
to
the
cord
hanging
beside
the
ladder
i
hauled
it
up
and
finding
the
boys
rather
in
my
way
told
them
to
go
down
while
i
proceeded
to
fasten
the
pulley
to
a
stout
branch
above
me
that
we
might
be
able
to
haul
up
the
beams
we
should
require
the
next
day
i
then
made
other
preparations
that
there
might
be
no
delay
on
the
morrow
and
a
bright
moon
having
arisen
i
by
its
light
continued
working
until
i
was
quite
worn
out
and
then
at
length
descended
i
reached
the
ground
but
to
my
surprise
found
that
the
two
boys
were
not
there
they
had
not
been
seen
a
moment
afterward
however
all
anxiety
was
dispelled
for
among
the
topmost
boughs
i
heard
their
young
voices
raised
in
the
evening
hymn
instead
of
descending
they
had
while
i
was
busy
climbed
upward
and
had
been
sitting
in
silent
admiration
of
the
moonlight
scene
high
above
me
they
now
joined
us
and
my
wife
showed
me
the
results
of
her
labor
she
had
made
two
complete
sets
of
harness
i
congratulated
her
upon
her
success
and
we
then
sat
down
to
supper
on
a
cloth
spread
out
upon
the
grass
were
arranged
a
roast
shoulder
of
porcupine
a
delicious
bowl
of
soup
made
from
a
piece
of
the
same
animal
cheese
butter
and
biscuits
forming
a
most
tempting
repast
having
done
this
ample
justice
we
collected
our
cattle
and
the
pigeons
and
fowls
having
retired
to
roost
on
the
neighboring
trees
and
on
the
steps
of
our
ladder
we
made
up
a
glorious
fire
to
keep
off
any
prowling
wild
beasts
and
ourselves
lay
down
the
children
in
spite
of
the
novelty
of
the
hammocks
were
quickly
asleep
in
vain
i
tried
to
follow
their
example
a
thousand
anxious
thoughts
presented
themselves
and
as
quickly
as
i
dispelled
them
others
rose
in
their
place
the
night
wore
on
and
i
was
still
awake
the
fire
burned
low
and
i
rose
and
replenished
it
with
dry
fuel
then
again
i
climbed
into
my
hammock
and
toward
morning
fell
asleep
early
next
morning
we
were
astir
and
dispersed
to
our
various
occupations
my
wife
milked
the
goats
and
cow
while
we
gave
the
animals
their
food
after
which
we
went
down
to
the
beach
to
collect
more
wood
for
our
building
operations
to
the
larger
beams
we
harnessed
the
cow
and
ass
while
we
ourselves
dragged
up
the
remainder
fritz
and
i
then
ascended
the
tree
and
finished
the
preparations
i
had
begun
the
night
before
all
useless
boughs
we
lopped
off
leaving
a
few
about
six
feet
from
the
floor
from
which
we
might
sling
our
hammocks
and
others
still
higher
to
support
a
temporary
roof
of
sailcloth
my
wife
made
fast
the
planks
to
a
rope
passed
through
the
block
i
had
fixed
to
the
boughs
above
us
and
by
this
means
fritz
and
i
hauled
them
up
these
we
arranged
side
by
side
on
the
foundation
of
boughs
so
as
to
form
a
smooth
solid
floor
and
round
this
platform
built
a
bulwark
of
planks
and
then
throwing
the
sailcloth
over
the
higher
branches
we
drew
it
down
and
firmly
nailed
it
our
house
was
thus
enclosed
on
three
sides
for
behind
the
great
trunk
protected
us
while
the
front
was
left
open
to
admit
the
fresh
sea
breeze
which
blew
directly
in
we
then
hauled
up
our
hammocks
and
bedding
and
slung
them
from
the
branches
we
had
left
for
that
purpose
a
few
hours
of
daylight
still
remaining
we
cleared
the
floor
of
leaves
and
chips
and
then
descended
to
fashion
a
table
and
a
few
benches
from
the
remainder
of
the
wood
after
working
like
slaves
all
day
fritz
and
i
flung
ourselves
on
the
grass
while
my
wife
arranged
supper
on
the
table
we
had
made
come
said
she
at
length
come
and
taste
flamingo
stew
and
tell
me
how
you
like
it
ernest
assured
me
that
it
would
be
much
better
stewed
than
roasted
and
i
have
been
following
his
directions
laughing
at
the
idea
of
ernest
turning
scientific
cook
we
sat
down
the
fowls
gathered
round
us
to
pick
up
the
crumbs
and
the
tame
flamingo
joined
them
while
master
knips
skipped
about
from
one
to
the
other
chattering
and
mimicking
our
gestures
continually
to
my
wife
joy
the
sow
appeared
shortly
after
and
was
presented
with
all
the
milk
that
remained
from
the
day
stock
that
she
might
be
persuaded
to
return
every
night
for
said
my
wife
this
surplus
milk
is
really
of
no
use
to
us
as
it
will
be
sour
before
the
morning
in
this
hot
climate
you
are
quite
right
i
replied
but
we
must
contrive
to
make
it
of
use
the
next
time
fritz
and
i
return
to
the
wreck
we
will
bring
off
a
churn
among
the
other
things
we
require
must
you
really
go
again
to
that
dreadful
wreck
said
my
wife
shuddering
you
have
no
idea
how
anxious
i
am
when
you
are
away
there
go
we
must
i
am
afraid
i
replied
but
not
for
a
day
or
two
yet
come
it
is
getting
late
we
and
the
chickens
must
go
to
roost
we
lit
our
and
leaving
the
dogs
on
guard
below
ascended
the
ladder
fritz
ernest
and
jack
were
up
in
a
moment
their
mother
followed
very
cautiously
for
though
she
had
originated
the
idea
of
building
a
nest
she
yet
hesitated
to
entrust
herself
at
such
a
terrific
height
from
the
ground
when
she
was
safely
landed
in
the
house
taking
little
franz
on
my
back
i
let
go
the
fastenings
which
secured
the
lower
end
of
the
ladder
to
the
ground
and
swinging
to
and
fro
slowly
ascended
then
for
the
first
time
we
stood
all
together
in
our
new
home
i
drew
up
the
ladder
and
with
a
greater
sense
of
security
than
i
had
enjoyed
since
we
landed
on
the
island
offered
up
our
evening
prayer
and
retired
for
the
night
chapter
iv
some
useful
discoveries
a
comical
incident
next
morning
all
were
early
awake
and
the
children
sprang
about
the
tree
like
young
monkeys
what
shall
we
begin
to
do
father
they
cried
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
rest
my
boys
i
replied
rest
rest
repeated
they
why
should
we
rest
days
shalt
thou
labor
and
do
all
that
thou
hast
to
do
but
on
the
seventh
thou
shalt
do
no
manner
of
work
this
is
the
seventh
day
i
replied
on
it
therefore
let
us
rest
what
is
it
really
sunday
asked
jack
how
jolly
oh
i
wo
do
any
work
but
i
take
a
bow
and
arrow
and
shoot
and
we
climb
about
the
tree
and
have
fun
all
day
that
is
not
resting
said
i
that
is
not
the
way
you
are
accustomed
to
spend
the
lord
day
no
but
then
we
ca
go
to
church
here
and
there
is
nothing
else
to
do
we
can
worship
here
as
well
as
at
home
said
i
but
there
is
no
church
no
clergyman
and
no
organ
said
franz
the
leafy
shade
of
this
great
tree
is
far
more
beautiful
than
any
church
i
said
there
will
we
worship
our
creator
come
boys
down
with
you
turn
our
dining
hall
into
a
breakfast
room
the
children
one
by
one
slipped
down
the
ladder
my
dear
elizabeth
said
i
this
morning
we
will
devote
to
the
service
of
the
lord
and
by
means
of
a
parable
i
will
endeavor
to
give
the
children
some
serious
thoughts
but
without
books
or
the
possibility
of
any
of
the
usual
sunday
occupations
we
can
not
keep
them
quiet
the
whole
day
afterward
therefore
i
shall
allow
them
to
pursue
any
innocent
recreation
they
choose
and
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
we
will
take
a
walk
my
wife
entirely
agreed
with
my
proposal
and
having
breakfasted
the
family
assembled
round
me
as
we
sat
in
the
pleasant
shade
on
the
fresh
soft
green
grass
after
singing
some
hymns
and
offering
heartfelt
prayers
to
the
almighty
giver
of
all
good
i
told
the
children
i
would
relate
to
them
a
parable
instead
of
preaching
a
sermon
oh
that
would
be
delightful
i
like
the
parables
in
the
bible
better
than
anything
said
franz
when
can
we
hear
you
read
out
of
the
bible
again
father
ah
my
little
boy
your
words
reproach
me
returned
i
while
eagerly
striving
to
procure
from
the
ship
what
would
feed
our
bodies
and
provide
for
their
comfort
i
blush
to
think
that
i
have
neglected
the
bread
of
life
the
word
of
god
i
shall
search
for
a
bible
on
my
next
return
to
the
wreck
although
our
own
books
were
nearly
all
destroyed
i
am
pretty
sure
to
find
one
at
these
words
my
wife
arose
and
fetching
her
magic
bag
she
drew
from
it
a
copy
of
the
holy
scriptures
which
i
thankfully
received
from
her
hand
and
after
reading
aloud
from
its
sacred
pages
i
spoke
as
follows
a
great
king
ruling
in
power
and
splendor
over
a
vast
realm
of
light
and
love
possessed
within
its
boundaries
a
desolate
and
unfruitful
island
this
spot
he
made
the
object
of
his
special
care
and
lavishing
on
it
all
the
varied
resources
of
his
might
and
goodness
it
bloomed
in
beauty
and
became
the
happy
residence
of
a
band
of
colonists
who
were
charged
not
only
with
the
cultivation
and
improvement
of
the
soil
but
each
individually
was
bound
to
cherish
in
his
soul
the
spirit
of
love
and
true
allegiance
to
his
sovereign
while
this
faithful
union
was
maintained
the
colony
flourished
and
the
noblest
virtues
exalted
and
rendered
happy
the
existence
of
every
member
of
the
race
that
a
discontented
and
rebellious
spirit
should
ever
have
infected
these
fortunate
subjects
of
so
loving
a
master
seems
incredible
yet
so
it
was
disobedience
and
pride
brought
misery
and
punishment
the
fair
prospects
of
the
colony
were
blighted
the
labors
of
the
colonists
were
unblessed
and
total
separation
from
the
parent
kingdom
seemed
inevitable
a
message
of
pardon
of
free
forgiveness
was
nevertheless
accorded
to
these
rebels
and
to
all
who
humbly
accepting
it
molded
their
future
lives
to
the
will
of
the
great
king
now
revealed
in
a
character
even
more
gracious
than
before
was
held
out
the
promise
of
removal
at
last
from
among
the
ruins
caused
by
the
great
rebellion
to
the
glory
and
undimmed
splendor
of
the
realm
of
light
and
blessedness
having
interested
the
children
i
then
leaving
allegory
pressed
simply
and
earnestly
home
to
each
young
heart
the
truths
i
sought
to
teach
and
with
a
short
prayer
for
a
blessing
on
my
words
brought
the
service
to
a
close
after
a
thoughtful
pause
we
separated
and
each
employed
himself
as
he
felt
disposed
i
took
some
arrows
and
endeavored
to
point
them
with
porcupine
quills
franz
came
to
beg
me
make
a
little
bow
and
arrow
for
him
to
shoot
with
while
fritz
asked
my
advice
about
the
tiger
cat
skin
and
the
cases
he
was
to
contrive
from
it
jack
assisted
with
the
arrow
making
and
inserting
a
sharp
spine
at
one
end
of
each
reed
made
it
fast
with
and
began
to
wish
for
glue
to
ensure
its
remaining
firm
o
jack
mamma
soup
is
as
sticky
as
anything
cried
franz
shall
i
run
and
ask
for
a
cake
of
it
no
no
little
goose
better
look
for
some
real
glue
in
the
there
he
will
find
glue
to
be
sure
said
i
and
the
soup
would
scarcely
have
answered
your
purpose
but
jack
my
boy
i
do
not
like
to
hear
you
ridicule
your
little
brother
ideas
some
of
the
most
valuable
discoveries
have
been
the
result
of
thoughts
which
originally
appeared
no
wiser
than
his
while
thus
directing
and
assisting
my
sons
we
were
surprised
by
hearing
a
shot
just
over
our
heads
at
the
same
moment
two
small
birds
fell
dead
at
our
feet
and
looking
up
we
beheld
ernest
among
the
branches
as
bending
his
face
joyfully
toward
us
he
cried
well
hit
well
hit
a
good
shot
was
it
then
slipping
down
the
ladder
and
picking
up
the
birds
he
brought
them
to
me
one
was
a
kind
of
thrush
the
other
a
small
dove
called
the
ortolan
and
esteemed
a
very
great
delicacy
on
account
of
its
exquisite
flavor
as
the
figs
on
which
these
birds
came
to
feed
were
only
just
beginning
to
ripen
it
was
probable
that
they
would
soon
flock
in
numbers
to
our
trees
and
by
waiting
until
we
could
procure
them
in
large
quantities
we
might
provide
ourselves
with
valuable
food
for
the
rainy
season
by
placing
them
when
half
cooked
in
cases
with
melted
lard
or
butter
poured
over
them
by
this
time
jack
had
pointed
a
good
supply
of
arrows
and
industriously
practiced
archery
i
finished
the
bow
and
arrows
for
franz
and
expected
to
be
left
in
peace
but
the
young
man
next
demanded
a
quiver
and
i
had
to
invent
that
also
to
complete
his
equipment
it
was
easily
done
by
stripping
a
piece
of
bark
from
a
small
tree
fitting
a
flat
side
and
a
bottom
to
it
and
then
a
string
attaching
it
to
his
shoulders
the
youthful
hunter
filled
it
with
arrows
and
went
off
looking
as
his
mother
said
like
an
innocent
little
cupid
bent
on
conquest
not
long
after
this
we
were
summoned
to
dinner
and
all
right
willingly
obeyed
the
call
during
the
meal
i
interested
the
boys
very
much
by
proposing
to
decide
on
suitable
names
for
the
different
spots
we
had
visited
on
this
coast
for
said
i
it
will
become
more
and
more
troublesome
to
explain
what
we
mean
unless
we
do
so
beside
which
we
shall
feel
much
more
at
home
if
we
can
talk
as
people
do
in
inhabited
countries
instead
of
saying
for
instance
little
island
at
the
mouth
of
our
bay
where
we
found
the
dead
shark
large
stream
near
our
tent
across
which
we
made
the
bridge
wood
where
we
found
cocoanuts
and
caught
the
monkey
and
so
on
let
us
begin
by
naming
the
bay
in
which
we
landed
what
shall
we
call
it
oyster
bay
said
fritz
no
no
lobster
bay
cried
jack
in
memory
of
the
old
fellow
who
took
a
fancy
to
my
leg
i
think
observed
his
mother
that
in
token
of
gratitude
for
our
escape
we
should
call
it
safety
bay
this
name
met
with
general
approbation
and
was
forthwith
fixed
upon
other
names
were
quickly
chosen
our
first
place
of
abode
we
called
tentholm
the
islet
in
the
bay
shark
island
and
the
reedy
swamp
flamingo
marsh
it
was
some
time
before
the
serious
question
of
a
name
for
our
leafy
castle
could
be
decided
but
finally
it
was
entitled
falconhurst
and
we
then
rapidly
named
the
few
remaining
points
prospect
hill
the
eminence
we
first
ascended
cape
disappointment
from
whose
rocky
heights
we
had
strained
our
eyes
in
vain
search
for
our
ship
company
and
jackal
river
as
a
name
for
the
large
stream
at
our
landing
place
concluded
our
geographical
nomenclature
footnote
horst
in
german
means
nest
or
eyrie
in
the
afternoon
the
boys
went
on
with
their
various
employments
fritz
finished
his
cases
and
jack
asked
my
assistance
in
carrying
out
his
plan
of
making
a
cuirass
for
turk
out
of
the
porcupine
skin
after
thoroughly
cleansing
the
inside
we
cut
and
fitted
it
round
the
body
of
the
patient
dog
then
when
strings
were
sewn
on
and
it
became
tolerably
dry
he
was
armed
with
this
ingenious
coat
of
mail
and
a
most
singular
figure
he
cut
juno
strongly
objected
to
his
friendly
approaches
and
got
out
of
his
way
as
fast
as
she
could
and
it
was
clear
that
he
would
easily
put
to
flight
the
fiercest
animal
he
might
encounter
while
protected
by
armor
at
once
defensive
and
offensive
i
determined
to
make
also
a
helmet
for
jack
out
of
the
remainder
of
the
skin
which
to
his
infinite
delight
i
speedily
did
amid
these
interesting
occupations
the
evening
drew
on
and
after
a
pleasant
walk
among
the
sweet
glades
near
our
abode
we
closed
our
sabbath
day
with
prayer
and
a
glad
hymn
of
praise
retiring
to
rest
with
peaceful
hearts
next
morning
i
proposed
an
expedition
to
tentholm
saying
i
wished
to
make
my
way
thither
by
a
different
route
we
left
the
tree
well
armed
i
and
my
three
elder
sons
each
carrying
a
gun
and
game
bag
while
little
franz
was
equipped
with
his
bow
and
quiver
full
of
arrows
a
most
curious
party
we
formed
fritz
adorned
with
his
belt
of
margay
skin
and
jack
with
his
extraordinary
looked
like
a
couple
of
young
savages
their
mother
and
i
walked
together
she
of
the
whole
party
being
the
only
one
unarmed
carried
a
jar
in
which
to
get
butter
from
tentholm
we
were
preceded
by
the
dogs
turk
armed
most
effectually
with
his
cuirass
of
porcupine
skin
and
juno
keeping
at
a
respectful
distance
from
so
formidable
a
companion
master
knips
fully
intended
to
mount
his
charger
as
usual
but
when
he
saw
him
arrayed
apparently
in
a
new
skin
he
approached
him
carefully
and
touching
him
with
one
paw
discovered
that
such
a
hide
would
make
anything
but
an
agreeable
seat
the
grimace
he
made
was
most
comical
and
chattering
vociferously
he
bounded
toward
juno
skipped
on
her
back
seated
himself
and
soon
appeared
perfectly
reconciled
to
the
change
of
steed
the
flamingo
saw
us
starting
and
having
been
much
petted
during
the
last
day
or
two
considered
himself
entitled
to
accompany
us
for
some
time
he
kept
beside
the
children
following
first
one
and
then
another
as
they
explored
the
wood
on
either
side
their
irregular
course
however
at
length
disgusted
him
and
abandoning
them
he
walked
sedately
by
my
side
we
strolled
on
in
the
cool
air
following
the
course
of
the
stream
the
great
trees
overshadowed
us
and
the
cool
green
sward
stretched
away
between
them
at
our
feet
the
boys
roamed
ahead
of
me
intent
on
exploration
presently
i
heard
a
joyful
shout
and
saw
ernest
running
at
full
speed
toward
me
followed
by
his
brothers
in
his
hand
he
held
a
plant
and
panting
for
breath
and
with
sparkling
eyes
he
held
it
up
to
me
potatoes
potatoes
father
he
gasped
out
yes
said
jack
acres
and
acres
of
potatoes
my
dear
ernest
said
i
for
there
was
no
mistaking
the
flower
and
leaf
and
the
light
bulbous
roots
you
have
indeed
made
a
discovery
with
the
potato
we
shall
never
starve
but
come
and
look
at
them
said
jack
come
and
feast
your
eyes
on
thousands
of
potatoes
we
hurried
to
the
spot
there
spread
out
before
us
was
a
great
tract
of
ground
covered
with
the
precious
plant
it
would
have
been
rather
difficult
remarked
jack
not
to
have
discovered
such
a
great
field
very
likely
replied
ernest
smiling
but
i
doubt
if
you
would
have
discovered
that
it
was
a
potato
field
perhaps
not
said
jack
you
are
quite
welcome
at
all
events
to
the
honor
of
the
discovery
i
have
the
honor
of
being
the
first
to
get
a
supply
of
them
so
saying
he
dug
up
with
hands
and
knife
a
number
of
plants
and
filled
his
game
bag
with
the
roots
the
monkey
followed
his
example
and
scratching
away
with
his
paws
most
cleverly
soon
had
a
heap
beside
him
so
delighted
were
we
with
the
discovery
and
so
eager
were
we
to
possess
a
large
supply
of
the
roots
that
we
stopped
not
digging
until
every
bag
pouch
and
pocket
was
filled
some
wished
to
return
at
once
to
falconhurst
to
cook
and
taste
our
new
acquisition
but
this
i
and
we
continued
our
march
heavily
laden
but
delighted
how
said
i
can
we
thank
the
giver
of
all
these
blessings
sufficiently
oh
said
franz
we
can
say
thank
thee
o
lord
for
all
thy
goodness
and
mercy
and
bless
us
for
jesus
christ
sake
amen
that
would
not
be
sufficient
said
fritz
do
you
think
it
would
be
enough
just
to
say
to
father
and
mother
you
for
all
you
do
and
not
to
show
that
we
were
really
thankful
by
loving
them
and
doing
what
we
can
to
please
them
you
are
quite
right
fritz
said
i
franz
did
not
say
all
that
was
necessary
he
should
have
added
me
grace
to
do
thy
will
and
to
obey
thee
in
all
things
as
we
thus
talked
we
reached
the
head
of
our
streamlet
where
it
fell
from
the
rocks
above
in
a
beautiful
sparkling
splashing
cascade
we
crossed
and
entered
the
tall
grass
on
the
other
side
we
forced
our
way
through
with
difficulty
so
thick
and
tangled
were
the
reeds
beyond
this
the
landscape
was
most
lovely
rich
tropical
vegetation
flourished
on
every
side
the
tall
stately
palms
surrounded
by
luxuriant
ferns
brilliant
flowers
and
graceful
creepers
the
prickly
cactus
shooting
up
amidst
them
aloe
jasmine
and
vanilla
the
indian
pea
and
above
all
the
regal
loaded
the
breath
of
the
evening
breeze
with
their
rich
perfume
the
boys
were
delighted
with
the
and
so
eagerly
did
they
fall
to
that
my
wife
had
to
caution
them
that
there
were
no
doctors
on
our
territory
and
if
they
became
ill
they
would
have
to
cure
themselves
as
best
they
might
this
advice
however
seemed
to
have
small
effect
on
my
sons
and
showing
knips
what
they
wanted
they
sent
him
after
the
ripest
and
best
fruit
while
they
were
thus
employed
i
examined
the
other
shrubs
and
bushes
among
these
i
presently
noticed
one
which
i
knew
well
from
description
to
be
the
karatas
come
here
boys
i
said
here
is
something
of
far
more
value
than
your
do
you
see
that
plant
with
long
pointed
leaves
and
beautiful
red
flower
that
is
the
karatas
the
filaments
of
the
leaves
make
capital
thread
while
the
leaves
themselves
bruised
form
an
invaluable
salve
the
pith
of
this
wonderful
plant
may
be
used
either
for
tinder
or
bait
for
fish
suppose
ernest
you
had
been
wrecked
here
how
would
you
have
made
a
fire
without
matches
or
flint
and
steel
as
the
savages
do
replied
he
i
would
rub
two
pieces
of
wood
together
until
they
kindled
try
it
i
said
but
if
you
please
try
it
when
you
have
a
whole
day
before
you
and
no
other
work
to
be
done
for
i
am
certain
it
would
be
night
before
you
accomplished
the
feat
but
see
here
and
i
broke
a
dry
twig
from
the
karatas
and
peeling
off
the
bark
laid
the
pith
upon
a
stone
i
struck
a
couple
of
pebbles
over
it
and
they
emitting
a
spark
the
pith
caught
fire
the
boys
were
delighted
with
the
experiment
i
then
drew
some
of
the
threads
from
the
leaves
and
presented
them
to
my
wife
but
what
said
fritz
is
the
use
of
all
these
other
prickly
plants
except
to
annoy
one
here
for
instance
is
a
disagreeable
little
tree
that
is
an
indian
fig
said
i
it
grows
best
on
dry
rocky
ground
for
most
of
its
nourishment
is
derived
from
the
air
its
juice
is
used
i
believe
medicinally
while
its
fruit
is
pleasant
and
wholesome
master
jack
was
off
in
a
moment
when
he
heard
of
a
new
delicacy
and
attempted
to
gather
some
of
the
fruit
but
in
vain
the
sharp
thorns
defied
his
efforts
and
with
bleeding
hands
and
rueful
countenance
he
returned
i
removed
the
thorns
from
his
hands
and
making
a
sharp
wooden
skewer
i
thrust
it
into
a
fig
and
quickly
twisted
it
from
its
branch
and
split
it
open
with
a
knife
still
holding
it
upon
the
skewer
the
rest
followed
my
example
and
we
regaled
ourselves
upon
the
fruit
which
we
found
excellent
ernest
carefully
examined
the
fig
he
was
eating
what
are
these
he
exclaimed
presently
little
red
insects
they
cling
all
over
the
fruit
and
i
can
not
shake
them
off
can
they
be
cochineal
he
handed
me
the
fig
and
i
examined
it
attentively
you
are
quite
right
my
boy
i
said
there
is
no
doubt
this
is
the
real
cochineal
however
though
it
is
worth
its
weight
in
gold
to
european
traders
it
is
of
little
use
to
us
i
am
afraid
unless
any
of
you
care
to
appear
in
gay
colors
the
cochineal
you
know
forms
the
most
lovely
scarlet
dye
no
thank
you
said
jack
but
we
will
take
a
lot
of
it
when
we
go
home
again
now
let
us
find
something
more
useful
to
us
and
they
thereupon
plied
me
incessantly
with
questions
concerning
every
plant
and
shrub
we
passed
stop
stop
i
said
at
length
the
most
learned
naturalist
would
be
much
puzzled
with
many
of
these
trees
and
i
who
have
never
seen
any
of
them
before
and
know
them
merely
by
description
can
not
pretend
to
tell
you
the
names
or
explain
to
you
the
use
of
of
them
discussing
however
the
properties
of
such
shrubs
as
i
did
know
we
at
length
reached
tentholm
everything
was
safe
and
we
set
to
work
to
collect
what
we
wanted
i
opened
the
butter
cask
from
which
my
wife
filled
her
pot
fritz
saw
after
the
ammunition
and
jack
and
ernest
ran
down
to
the
beach
to
capture
the
geese
and
ducks
this
they
found
no
easy
matter
for
the
birds
left
so
long
alone
were
shy
and
nothing
would
induce
them
to
come
on
shore
and
be
caught
ernest
at
length
hit
upon
an
ingenious
plan
he
took
some
pieces
of
cheese
and
tied
them
to
long
strings
this
bait
he
threw
into
the
water
and
the
hungry
ducks
instantly
made
a
grab
at
it
then
with
a
little
skillful
maneuvering
he
drew
them
on
shore
while
jack
and
he
were
thus
busily
employed
catching
and
tying
the
rebels
together
by
the
feet
we
procured
a
fresh
supply
of
salt
which
we
packed
upon
turk
back
first
relieving
him
of
his
coat
of
mail
the
birds
we
fastened
to
our
game
bags
and
carefully
closing
the
door
of
our
tent
started
homeward
by
the
seashore
after
a
cheerful
and
pleasant
walk
we
once
more
reached
our
woodland
abode
i
released
the
birds
and
clipping
their
wings
to
prevent
their
leaving
us
established
them
on
the
stream
then
after
a
delicious
supper
of
potatoes
milk
and
butter
we
ascended
our
tree
and
turned
in
having
remarked
a
great
deal
of
driftwood
on
the
sands
the
preceding
evening
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
would
be
well
to
get
some
of
it
and
make
a
kind
of
sledge
so
that
the
labor
of
fetching
what
we
wanted
from
our
stores
at
tentholm
might
not
fall
so
heavily
on
ourselves
i
awoke
early
and
roused
ernest
as
my
assistant
wishing
to
encourage
him
to
overcome
his
natural
fault
of
indolence
after
a
little
stretching
and
yawning
he
got
up
cheerfully
pleased
with
the
idea
of
an
expedition
while
the
others
still
slept
and
we
made
our
way
to
the
beach
taking
with
us
the
donkey
who
drew
a
large
broad
bough
which
i
expected
to
find
useful
in
bringing
back
our
load
as
we
went
along
i
remarked
to
ernest
that
i
supposed
he
was
rather
sorry
for
himself
and
grudged
leaving
his
cozy
hammock
and
pleasant
dreams
at
this
untimely
hour
oh
father
do
not
laugh
at
my
laziness
indeed
i
mean
to
cure
myself
of
it
i
am
very
glad
to
go
with
you
i
intended
to
shoot
some
more
of
the
ortolans
this
morning
but
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
afterward
the
boys
will
be
shooting
at
them
i
daresay
but
i
do
expect
they
will
have
any
great
luck
why
not
pray
inquired
i
i
do
believe
they
will
know
what
shot
to
use
at
first
and
besides
they
will
most
likely
shoot
upward
at
the
birds
and
be
sure
to
miss
them
on
account
of
the
great
height
and
thickness
of
the
branches
and
foliage
well
ernest
you
certainly
possess
the
gifts
of
prudence
and
reflection
as
well
as
observation
these
are
valuable
but
sudden
action
is
so
often
necessary
in
life
that
i
advise
you
to
cultivate
the
power
of
instantly
perceiving
and
deciding
what
must
be
done
in
cases
of
emergency
presence
of
mind
is
a
precious
quality
which
although
natural
in
some
characters
may
be
acquired
in
a
certain
degree
by
all
who
train
themselves
to
it
once
on
the
seashore
our
work
was
quickly
accomplished
for
selecting
the
wood
i
thought
fit
for
my
purpose
we
laid
it
across
the
broad
leafy
branch
and
with
some
help
from
us
the
donkey
dragged
a
very
fair
load
of
it
homeward
with
the
addition
of
a
small
chest
which
i
raised
from
among
the
sand
which
nearly
covered
it
we
heard
the
boys
popping
away
at
the
birds
as
we
drew
near
they
hastened
to
meet
us
and
inquired
where
we
had
been
looking
curiously
at
the
chest
which
i
allowed
them
to
open
while
i
asked
my
wife
to
excuse
our
absence
without
leave
and
after
submitting
to
her
gentle
reprimand
i
explained
my
plan
for
a
sledge
which
pleased
her
greatly
and
she
already
imagined
it
loaded
with
her
hogshead
of
butter
and
on
its
way
from
tentholm
to
falconhurst
the
chest
proved
to
be
merely
that
of
a
common
sailor
containing
his
clothes
very
much
wetted
by
the
sea
water
the
boys
exhibited
an
array
of
several
dozen
birds
and
related
during
breakfast
the
various
incidents
of
failure
and
success
which
had
attended
their
guns
ernest
had
rightly
guessed
the
mistakes
they
would
make
but
practice
was
making
them
perfect
and
they
seemed
disposed
to
continue
their
sport
when
their
mother
assuring
them
that
she
could
not
use
more
birds
than
those
already
killed
asked
if
i
did
not
think
some
means
of
snaring
them
might
be
contrived
as
much
powder
and
shot
would
be
expended
if
they
fired
on
at
this
rate
entirely
agreeing
with
this
view
of
the
subject
i
desired
the
lads
to
lay
aside
their
guns
for
the
present
and
the
younger
ones
readily
applied
themselves
to
making
snares
of
the
long
threads
drawn
from
the
leaves
of
the
karatas
in
a
simple
way
i
taught
them
while
fritz
and
ernest
gave
me
substantial
assistance
in
the
manufacture
of
the
new
sledge
we
were
busily
at
work
when
a
tremendous
disturbance
among
our
fowls
led
us
to
suppose
that
a
fox
or
wild
cat
had
got
into
their
midst
the
cocks
crowed
defiantly
the
hens
fluttered
and
cackled
in
a
state
of
the
wildest
excitement
we
hastened
toward
them
but
ernest
remarking
master
knips
slipping
away
as
though
conscious
of
some
misdemeanor
went
to
watch
him
and
presently
caught
him
in
the
act
of
eating
a
egg
which
he
had
carried
off
and
hidden
among
the
grass
and
roots
ernest
found
several
others
these
were
very
welcome
to
my
wife
for
hitherto
the
hens
had
not
presented
us
with
any
eggs
hereafter
she
determined
to
imprison
the
monkey
every
morning
until
the
eggs
had
been
collected
soon
after
this
as
jack
was
setting
the
newly
made
snares
among
the
branches
he
discovered
that
a
pair
of
our
own
pigeons
were
building
in
the
tree
it
was
very
desirable
to
increase
our
stock
of
these
pretty
birds
and
i
cautioned
the
boys
against
shooting
near
our
tree
while
they
had
nests
there
and
also
with
regard
to
the
snares
which
were
meant
only
to
entrap
the
wild
although
my
sons
were
interested
in
setting
the
snares
they
by
no
means
approved
of
the
new
order
to
economize
the
ammunition
no
doubt
they
had
been
discussing
this
hardship
for
little
franz
came
to
me
with
a
brilliant
proposal
of
his
own
papa
said
he
why
should
we
not
begin
to
plant
some
powder
and
shot
immediately
it
would
be
so
much
more
useful
than
bare
grain
for
the
fowls
his
brothers
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
and
i
must
confess
i
found
it
no
easy
matter
to
keep
my
countenance
come
ernest
said
i
now
we
have
had
our
amusement
tell
the
little
fellow
what
gunpowder
really
is
it
is
not
seed
at
all
franz
ernest
explained
gunpowder
is
made
of
charcoal
sulphur
and
saltpeter
mixed
cleverly
together
so
you
see
it
can
not
be
sown
like
corn
any
more
than
shot
can
be
planted
like
peas
and
beans
my
carpentering
meantime
went
on
apace
in
order
to
shape
my
sledge
with
ends
properly
turned
up
in
front
i
had
chosen
wood
which
had
been
part
of
the
bow
of
the
vessel
and
was
curved
in
the
necessary
way
for
my
purpose
two
pieces
perfectly
similar
formed
the
sides
of
my
sleigh
or
sledge
and
i
simply
united
these
strongly
by
fixing
short
bars
across
them
then
when
the
ropes
of
the
donkey
harness
were
attached
to
the
raised
points
in
front
the
equipage
was
complete
and
ready
for
use
my
attention
had
been
for
some
time
wholly
engrossed
by
my
work
and
i
only
now
observed
that
the
mother
and
her
little
boys
had
been
busily
plucking
above
two
dozen
of
the
wild
birds
and
were
preparing
to
roast
them
spitted
in
a
row
on
a
long
narrow
sword
blade
belonging
to
one
of
our
ship
officers
it
seemed
somewhat
wasteful
to
cook
so
many
at
once
but
my
wife
explained
that
she
was
getting
them
ready
for
the
i
was
going
to
fetch
for
her
on
the
new
sledge
as
i
had
advised
her
to
preserve
them
and
packed
in
butter
amused
at
her
promptitude
i
could
do
nothing
less
than
promise
to
go
for
her
cask
directly
after
dinner
for
her
part
she
resolved
in
our
absence
to
have
a
grand
wash
of
linen
and
other
clothes
and
she
advised
me
to
arrange
regular
baths
for
all
the
boys
in
future
early
in
the
afternoon
ernest
and
i
were
ready
to
be
off
equipped
as
usual
fritz
presented
us
each
with
a
neat
case
of
margay
skin
to
hang
at
our
girdles
we
harnessed
both
cow
and
ass
to
the
sledge
and
accompanied
by
juno
cheerfully
took
our
departure
choosing
the
way
by
the
sands
and
reaching
tentholm
without
accident
or
adventure
there
unharnessing
the
animals
we
began
at
once
to
load
the
sledge
not
only
with
the
butter
cask
but
with
a
powder
chest
a
barrel
of
cheese
and
a
variety
of
other
articles
ball
shot
tools
and
turk
armor
which
had
been
left
behind
on
our
last
visit
our
work
had
so
closely
engaged
our
attention
that
when
we
were
ready
to
leave
it
and
go
in
search
of
a
good
bathing
place
we
discovered
that
our
two
animals
had
wandered
quite
out
of
sight
having
crossed
the
bridge
to
reach
the
good
pasture
beyond
the
river
i
sent
ernest
after
them
and
went
alone
to
the
extremity
of
the
bay
it
terminated
in
bold
and
precipitous
cliffs
which
extended
into
the
deep
water
and
rose
abruptly
so
as
to
form
an
inaccessible
wall
of
rock
and
crag
swampy
ground
overgrown
with
large
canes
intervened
between
me
and
these
cliffs
i
cut
a
large
bundle
of
the
reeds
and
returned
to
ernest
it
was
some
time
before
i
found
him
comfortably
extended
full
length
on
the
ground
near
the
tent
and
sleeping
as
sound
as
a
top
while
the
cow
and
the
ass
grazing
at
will
were
again
making
for
the
bridge
get
up
ernest
you
lazy
fellow
exclaimed
i
much
annoyed
why
you
mind
your
business
look
at
the
animals
they
will
be
over
the
river
again
no
fear
of
that
father
returned
he
with
the
utmost
composure
i
have
taken
a
couple
of
boards
off
the
bridge
they
wo
pass
the
gap
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
ingenious
device
by
which
the
boy
had
spared
himself
all
trouble
at
the
same
time
i
observed
that
it
is
wrong
to
waste
the
precious
moments
in
sleep
when
duty
has
to
be
performed
i
then
bid
him
go
and
collect
some
salt
which
was
wanted
at
home
while
i
went
to
bathe
on
coming
back
much
refreshed
i
again
missed
ernest
and
began
to
wonder
whether
he
was
still
gathering
salt
or
whether
he
had
lain
down
somewhere
to
finish
his
nap
when
i
heard
him
loudly
calling
father
father
i
caught
a
fish
an
immense
fellow
he
is
i
can
scarcely
hold
him
he
drags
the
line
so
hastening
toward
the
spot
i
saw
the
boy
lying
in
the
grass
on
a
point
of
land
close
to
the
mouth
of
the
stream
and
with
all
his
might
keeping
hold
of
a
rod
the
line
was
strained
to
the
utmost
by
the
frantic
efforts
of
a
very
large
fish
which
was
attempting
to
free
itself
from
the
hook
i
quickly
took
the
rod
from
him
and
giving
the
fish
more
line
led
him
by
degrees
into
shallow
water
ernest
ran
in
with
his
hatchet
and
killed
him
it
proved
to
be
a
salmon
of
full
fifteen
pounds
weight
and
i
was
delighted
to
think
of
taking
such
a
valuable
prize
to
the
mother
this
is
capital
ernest
cried
i
you
have
cleared
yourself
for
once
of
the
charge
of
laziness
let
us
now
carry
this
splendid
salmon
to
the
sledge
i
will
clean
and
pack
it
for
the
journey
that
it
may
arrive
in
good
condition
while
you
go
and
take
a
bath
in
the
sea
all
this
being
accomplished
we
harnessed
our
beasts
to
the
vehicle
and
replacing
the
boards
on
the
bridge
commenced
the
journey
home
we
kept
inland
this
time
and
were
skirting
the
borders
of
a
grassy
thicket
when
juno
suddenly
left
us
and
plunging
into
the
bushes
with
fierce
barking
hunted
out
right
in
front
of
us
the
most
creature
i
ever
beheld
it
was
taking
wonderful
flying
leaps
apparently
in
a
sitting
posture
and
got
over
the
ground
at
an
astonishing
rate
i
attempted
to
shoot
it
as
it
passed
but
missed
ernest
who
was
behind
me
observed
its
movements
very
coolly
and
seeing
that
the
dog
was
puzzled
and
that
the
animal
having
paused
was
crouching
among
the
grass
went
cautiously
nearer
fired
at
the
spot
he
had
marked
and
shot
it
dead
the
extraordinary
appearance
of
this
creature
surprised
us
very
much
it
was
as
large
as
a
sheep
its
head
was
shaped
like
that
of
a
mouse
its
skin
also
was
of
a
mouse
color
it
had
long
ears
like
a
hare
and
a
tail
like
a
tiger
the
forepaws
resembled
those
of
a
squirrel
but
they
seemed
only
while
the
hind
legs
were
enormous
and
so
long
that
when
upright
on
them
the
animal
would
look
as
if
mounted
on
stilts
for
some
time
we
stood
silently
wondering
at
the
remarkable
creature
before
us
i
could
not
recollect
to
have
seen
or
heard
of
any
such
well
father
said
ernest
at
last
i
should
say
this
was
about
the
queerest
beast
to
be
met
with
anywhere
i
am
glad
i
knocked
it
over
how
they
will
all
stare
when
i
carry
it
home
you
have
had
a
lucky
day
altogether
certainly
said
i
but
i
can
not
think
what
this
animal
can
be
examine
its
teeth
and
let
us
see
to
what
class
of
mammalia
it
belongs
we
may
be
led
to
guess
at
its
name
in
that
way
i
see
four
sharp
incisor
teeth
father
two
upper
and
two
under
as
a
squirrel
has
ah
then
he
is
a
rodent
what
rodents
can
you
remember
ernest
i
do
not
know
them
all
but
there
are
the
mouse
the
marmot
the
squirrel
the
hare
the
beaver
the
jerboa
the
jerboa
i
exclaimed
the
jerboa
now
we
shall
have
it
this
is
really
very
like
a
jerboa
only
far
larger
it
must
be
a
kangaroo
one
of
the
class
of
animals
which
has
a
pouch
or
purse
beneath
the
body
in
which
its
young
can
take
refuge
they
were
discovered
in
new
holland
by
the
great
captain
cook
and
i
congratulate
you
on
being
the
first
to
obtain
a
specimen
in
new
switzerland
i
added
laughing
as
i
extemporized
the
name
the
kangaroo
was
added
to
the
already
heavy
load
on
our
sledge
and
we
proceeded
slowly
arriving
late
at
falconhurst
but
meeting
with
the
usual
bright
welcome
very
eager
and
inquisitive
were
the
glances
turned
toward
the
sledge
for
the
load
piled
on
it
surpassed
all
expectation
we
on
our
part
staring
in
equal
surprise
at
the
extraordinary
rig
of
the
young
folks
who
came
to
meet
us
one
wore
a
long
which
with
a
belt
was
a
convenient
length
in
front
but
trailed
behind
in
orthodox
ghost
fashion
another
had
on
a
very
wide
pair
of
trousers
braced
up
so
short
that
each
little
leg
looked
like
the
clapper
in
a
bell
the
third
buttoned
up
in
a
which
came
down
to
his
ankles
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
walking
portmanteau
amid
much
joking
and
laughter
the
mother
explained
that
she
had
been
washing
all
day
and
while
their
clothes
were
drying
the
boys
amused
themselves
by
dressing
up
in
things
they
found
while
rummaging
the
sailor
chest
and
had
kept
them
on
that
ernest
and
i
might
see
the
masquerade
it
certainly
amused
us
but
made
me
regret
that
so
little
belonging
to
ourselves
had
been
saved
from
the
wreck
in
consequence
of
which
the
children
had
scarcely
a
change
of
linen
turning
now
to
our
new
acquisitions
we
excited
great
interest
by
exhibiting
each
in
turn
the
large
salmon
but
more
especially
the
kangaroo
surprised
and
delighted
everyone
fritz
alone
wore
a
look
expressive
of
dissatisfaction
and
i
saw
that
he
was
envious
of
his
younger
brother
success
vexed
that
so
noble
a
prize
had
fallen
to
ernest
gun
instead
of
his
own
he
treated
it
rather
slightingly
but
i
could
see
that
he
was
struggling
against
his
jealous
feelings
and
he
after
a
while
succeeded
in
recovering
his
good
humor
and
joined
pleasantly
in
the
conversation
what
a
famous
day
sport
you
have
had
altogether
said
he
coming
close
up
to
me
it
will
be
my
turn
to
go
out
with
you
next
will
it
not
father
just
about
here
there
is
nothing
to
shoot
and
i
have
found
it
very
dull
still
you
have
been
doing
your
duty
my
dear
boy
you
were
entrusted
with
the
care
of
the
family
and
a
youth
of
manly
character
will
not
depend
for
happiness
on
mere
excitement
as
the
shades
of
night
approached
we
made
haste
to
conclude
the
work
by
preparing
the
kangaroo
part
for
immediate
use
and
part
for
salting
the
animals
were
fed
and
a
plentiful
allowance
of
salt
made
to
them
our
own
supper
of
broiled
salmon
and
potatoes
was
dispatched
with
great
appetite
and
we
retired
with
thankful
hearts
to
sound
and
repose
chapter
v
a
second
visit
to
the
wreck
next
morning
while
the
breakfast
was
getting
ready
i
attended
to
the
beautiful
skin
of
the
kangaroo
which
i
was
anxious
to
preserve
entire
and
afterward
when
fritz
had
prepared
everything
in
readiness
for
our
trip
to
the
wreck
i
called
ernest
and
jack
in
order
to
give
them
some
parting
injunctions
they
however
had
disappeared
directly
after
breakfast
and
their
mother
could
only
guess
that
as
we
required
potatoes
they
might
have
gone
to
fetch
a
supply
i
desired
her
to
reprove
them
on
their
return
for
starting
away
without
leave
but
as
it
appeared
they
had
taken
turk
i
satisfied
myself
that
no
harm
was
likely
to
befall
them
although
it
was
not
without
reluctance
that
i
left
my
dear
wife
alone
with
little
franz
cheering
her
with
hopes
of
our
speedy
return
with
new
treasures
from
the
wreck
advancing
steadily
on
our
way
we
crossed
the
bridge
at
jackal
river
when
suddenly
to
our
no
small
astonishment
jack
and
ernest
burst
out
of
a
hiding
place
where
they
had
lain
in
wait
for
us
and
were
enchanted
with
the
startling
effect
of
their
unexpected
appearance
upon
their
unsuspecting
father
and
brother
it
was
evident
that
they
fully
believed
they
might
now
go
with
us
to
the
wreck
to
this
notion
i
at
once
put
a
decided
stop
although
i
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
scold
the
two
merry
rogues
for
their
thoughtless
frolic
more
especially
as
i
particularly
wished
to
send
back
a
message
to
my
wife
i
told
them
they
must
hurry
home
so
as
not
to
leave
their
mother
in
suspense
although
as
they
were
already
so
far
they
might
collect
some
salt
and
i
instructed
them
to
explain
that
as
my
work
on
board
would
take
up
a
long
time
she
must
try
to
bear
with
our
absence
for
a
night
this
i
had
meant
to
say
when
we
parted
but
my
courage
had
failed
knowing
how
much
she
would
object
to
such
a
plan
and
i
had
resolved
to
return
in
the
evening
on
consideration
however
of
the
importance
of
constructing
a
raft
which
was
my
intention
in
going
and
finishing
it
without
a
second
trip
i
determined
to
remain
on
board
for
the
night
as
the
boys
had
unintentionally
given
me
the
chance
of
sending
a
message
to
that
effect
boys
take
care
of
yourselves
we
off
shouted
fritz
as
i
joined
him
in
the
and
we
shoved
off
the
current
carried
us
briskly
out
of
the
bay
we
were
very
soon
moored
safely
alongside
the
wreck
and
scrambling
up
her
shattered
sides
stood
on
what
remained
of
the
deck
and
began
at
once
to
lay
our
plans
i
wanted
to
make
a
raft
fit
to
carry
on
shore
a
great
variety
of
articles
far
too
large
and
heavy
for
our
present
boat
a
number
of
empty
water
casks
seemed
just
what
was
required
for
a
foundation
we
closed
them
tightly
pushed
them
overboard
and
arranging
twelve
of
them
side
by
side
in
rows
of
three
we
firmly
secured
them
together
by
means
of
spars
and
then
proceeded
to
lay
a
good
substantial
floor
of
planks
which
was
defended
by
a
low
bulwark
in
this
way
we
soon
had
a
raft
exactly
suited
to
our
purpose
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
return
to
land
that
same
evening
for
we
were
thoroughly
fatigued
by
our
labors
and
had
eaten
only
the
light
refreshment
we
had
brought
in
our
wallets
scarcely
desisting
a
moment
from
our
work
rejoicing
that
we
were
not
expected
home
we
now
made
an
excellent
supper
from
the
ship
provisions
and
then
rested
for
the
night
on
spring
mattresses
a
perfect
luxury
to
us
after
our
hard
and
narrow
hammocks
next
morning
we
actively
set
about
loading
the
raft
and
boat
first
carrying
off
the
entire
contents
of
our
own
cabins
and
passing
on
to
the
captain
room
we
removed
the
furniture
as
well
as
the
doors
and
with
their
bolts
bars
and
locks
we
next
took
the
officers
chests
and
those
belonging
to
the
carpenter
and
gunsmith
the
contents
of
these
latter
we
had
to
remove
in
portions
as
their
weight
was
far
beyond
our
strength
one
large
chest
was
filled
with
an
assortment
of
fancy
goods
and
reminded
us
of
a
jeweler
shop
so
glittering
was
the
display
of
gold
and
silver
watches
buckles
studs
chains
rings
and
all
manner
of
trinkets
these
and
a
box
of
money
drew
our
attention
for
a
time
but
more
useful
to
us
at
present
was
a
case
of
common
knives
and
forks
which
i
was
glad
to
find
as
more
suited
to
us
than
the
smart
silver
ones
we
had
previously
taken
on
shore
to
my
delight
we
found
most
carefully
packed
a
number
of
young
fruit
trees
and
we
read
on
the
tickets
attached
to
them
the
names
so
pleasant
to
european
ears
of
the
apple
pear
chestnut
orange
almond
peach
apricot
plum
cherry
and
vine
the
cargo
which
had
been
destined
for
the
supply
of
a
distant
colony
proved
in
fact
a
rich
and
almost
inexhaustible
treasure
to
us
ironmongery
plumber
tools
lead
paint
grindstones
cart
wheels
and
all
that
was
necessary
for
the
work
of
a
smith
forge
spades
and
plowshares
sacks
of
maize
peas
oats
and
wheat
a
and
also
the
parts
of
a
so
carefully
numbered
that
were
we
strong
enough
it
would
be
easy
to
put
it
up
had
been
stowed
away
so
bewildered
were
we
by
the
wealth
around
us
that
for
some
time
we
were
at
a
loss
as
to
what
to
remove
to
the
raft
it
would
be
impossible
to
take
everything
yet
the
first
storm
would
complete
the
destruction
of
the
ship
and
we
should
lose
all
we
left
behind
selecting
a
number
of
the
most
useful
articles
however
including
of
course
the
grain
and
the
fruit
trees
we
gradually
loaded
our
raft
fishing
lines
reels
cordage
and
a
couple
of
harpoons
were
put
on
board
as
well
as
a
mariner
compass
fritz
recollecting
our
encounter
with
the
shark
placed
the
harpoons
in
readiness
and
amused
me
by
seeming
to
picture
himself
a
whaler
flourishing
his
harpoon
in
most
approved
fashion
early
in
the
afternoon
both
our
crafts
were
heavily
laden
and
we
were
ready
to
make
for
the
shore
the
voyage
was
begun
with
considerable
anxiety
as
with
the
raft
in
tow
there
was
some
danger
of
an
accident
but
the
sea
being
calm
and
the
wind
favorable
we
found
we
could
spread
the
sail
and
our
progress
was
very
satisfactory
presently
fritz
asked
me
for
the
telescope
as
he
had
observed
something
curious
floating
at
a
distance
then
handing
it
back
he
begged
me
to
examine
the
object
which
i
soon
discovered
to
be
a
turtle
asleep
on
the
water
and
of
course
unconscious
of
our
approach
do
father
steer
toward
it
exclaimed
he
i
accordingly
did
so
that
he
might
have
a
nearer
look
at
the
creature
little
did
i
suspect
what
was
to
follow
the
lad
back
was
turned
to
me
and
the
broad
sail
was
between
us
so
that
i
could
not
perceive
his
actions
when
all
of
a
sudden
i
experienced
a
shock
and
the
thrill
as
of
line
running
through
a
reel
before
i
had
time
to
call
out
a
second
shock
and
the
sensation
of
the
boat
being
rapidly
drawn
through
the
water
alarmed
me
fritz
what
are
you
about
cried
i
you
are
sending
us
to
the
bottom
i
have
him
hurrah
i
have
him
safe
shouted
he
in
eager
excitement
to
my
amazement
i
perceived
that
he
really
had
struck
the
tortoise
with
a
harpoon
a
rope
was
attached
to
it
and
the
creature
was
running
away
with
us
lowering
the
sail
and
seizing
my
hatchet
i
hastened
forward
in
order
to
cut
the
line
and
cast
adrift
at
once
turtle
and
harpoon
father
do
wait
pleaded
the
boy
there
is
no
danger
just
yet
i
promise
to
cut
the
line
myself
the
instant
it
is
necessary
let
us
catch
this
turtle
if
we
possibly
can
my
dear
boy
the
turtle
will
be
a
very
dear
bargain
if
he
upsets
all
our
goods
into
the
sea
even
if
he
does
not
drown
us
too
for
sake
be
careful
i
will
wait
a
few
minutes
but
the
minute
there
is
danger
cut
the
line
as
the
turtle
began
to
make
for
the
open
sea
i
hoisted
the
sail
again
and
finding
the
opposition
too
much
for
it
the
creature
again
directed
its
course
landward
drawing
us
rapidly
after
it
the
part
of
the
shore
for
which
the
turtle
was
making
was
considerably
to
the
left
of
our
usual
landing
place
the
beach
there
shelved
very
gradually
and
at
some
distance
from
land
we
grounded
with
a
sharp
shock
but
fortunately
without
a
capsize
the
turtle
was
evidently
greatly
exhausted
and
no
wonder
since
it
had
been
acting
the
part
of
a
steam
tug
and
had
been
dragging
at
full
speed
a
couple
of
heavily
laden
vessels
its
intention
was
to
escape
to
land
but
i
leaped
into
the
water
and
wading
up
to
it
dispatched
it
with
my
ax
such
was
its
tenacity
of
life
however
that
it
did
not
cease
its
struggles
until
i
had
actually
severed
its
head
from
its
body
as
we
were
by
no
means
far
from
falconhurst
fritz
gave
notice
of
our
approach
by
firing
off
his
gun
as
well
as
shouting
loudly
in
his
glee
and
while
we
were
yet
engaged
in
securing
our
boats
and
getting
the
turtle
on
shore
the
whole
family
appeared
in
the
distance
hastening
eagerly
toward
us
and
our
new
prize
together
with
the
boat
and
raft
excited
the
liveliest
interest
my
wife
chief
pleasure
however
consisted
in
seeing
us
back
as
our
night
absence
had
disturbed
her
and
she
was
horrified
by
the
description
of
our
dangerous
run
in
the
wake
of
the
fugitive
turtle
being
anxious
to
remove
some
of
our
goods
before
night
the
boys
ran
off
to
fetch
the
sledge
while
i
having
no
anchor
contrived
to
moor
the
boats
by
means
of
some
of
the
heavy
blocks
of
iron
we
had
brought
it
required
our
united
strength
to
get
the
turtle
hoisted
on
to
the
sledge
its
weight
being
prodigious
we
found
it
indeed
with
the
addition
of
the
sapling
fruit
trees
quite
a
sufficient
load
we
then
made
the
best
of
our
way
home
chatting
merrily
about
our
various
adventures
the
first
thing
to
be
done
on
arriving
was
to
obtain
some
of
the
turtle
flesh
and
cook
it
for
supper
to
my
wife
this
appeared
necessarily
a
work
of
time
as
well
as
of
difficulty
but
i
turned
the
beast
on
its
back
and
soon
detached
a
portion
of
the
meat
from
the
breast
with
a
hatchet
by
breaking
the
lower
shell
and
i
then
directed
that
it
should
be
cooked
with
a
little
salt
shell
and
all
but
let
me
first
cut
away
this
disgusting
green
fat
said
my
wife
with
a
little
shudder
see
how
it
sticks
all
over
the
meat
no
one
could
eat
anything
so
nasty
leave
the
fat
whatever
you
do
exclaimed
i
why
my
dear
that
is
the
very
best
part
and
the
delight
of
the
epicure
if
there
be
really
too
much
cut
some
off
it
can
be
used
as
lard
and
let
the
dogs
make
a
supper
of
the
refuse
and
the
handsome
shell
cried
fritz
i
should
like
to
make
a
of
that
to
stand
near
the
brook
and
be
kept
always
full
of
clear
water
how
useful
it
would
be
that
is
a
capital
idea
i
replied
and
we
may
manage
it
easily
if
we
can
find
clay
so
as
to
make
a
firm
foundation
on
which
to
place
it
oh
as
to
clay
said
jack
i
have
a
grand
lump
of
clay
there
under
that
root
well
done
my
lad
when
did
you
find
it
he
found
a
bed
of
clay
near
the
river
this
morning
said
his
mother
and
came
home
in
such
a
mess
i
had
regularly
to
scrape
his
clothes
and
wash
him
thoroughly
well
mother
i
can
only
tell
you
i
should
never
in
all
my
days
have
found
the
clay
if
i
had
not
slipped
and
fallen
among
it
that
i
can
well
believe
returned
his
mother
only
to
hear
you
talk
this
morning
one
would
have
thought
your
discovery
of
clay
the
result
of
very
arduous
search
indeed
when
you
have
ended
the
question
of
the
clay
and
the
turtle
shell
said
ernest
i
should
like
to
show
you
some
roots
i
found
they
are
getting
rather
dry
now
they
look
something
like
radishes
although
the
plant
itself
was
almost
a
bush
but
i
have
not
ventured
to
taste
them
although
our
old
sow
was
devouring
them
at
a
great
rate
in
that
you
did
wisely
my
boy
swine
eat
many
things
injurious
to
men
let
me
see
your
roots
how
did
you
discover
them
i
was
rambling
in
the
wood
this
morning
and
came
upon
the
sow
very
busy
grubbing
under
a
small
bush
and
eating
something
ravenously
so
i
drove
her
away
and
found
a
number
of
these
roots
which
i
brought
for
you
to
see
indeed
ernest
i
exclaimed
after
taking
the
roots
in
my
hand
and
considering
them
attentively
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
you
have
really
made
a
brilliant
discovery
if
this
proves
to
be
as
i
expect
the
manioc
root
we
might
lose
every
other
eatable
we
possess
and
yet
not
starve
in
the
west
indies
cakes
called
cassava
bread
are
made
from
it
and
already
having
potatoes
we
shall
be
very
independent
if
we
can
succeed
in
preparing
flour
from
these
roots
great
care
must
be
taken
in
the
manufacture
to
express
the
juice
otherwise
the
flour
may
be
injurious
and
even
poisonous
if
we
can
collect
a
sufficient
quantity
we
will
attempt
i
think
i
know
how
to
set
about
it
finding
there
was
still
time
to
make
another
trip
with
the
sledge
i
went
off
with
the
elder
boys
leaving
franz
with
his
mother
and
we
all
looked
forward
with
satisfaction
to
the
prospect
of
the
princely
supper
they
were
to
have
ready
for
us
for
our
day
work
had
been
none
of
the
lightest
i
have
been
thinking
about
my
turtle
father
said
fritz
as
we
went
along
is
not
the
shell
very
valuable
surely
beautiful
combs
boxes
and
a
number
of
ornamental
things
are
made
of
tortoise
shell
and
if
so
it
seems
a
pity
to
use
it
for
a
your
turtle
fritz
is
only
fit
for
eating
its
shell
is
worthless
as
regards
ornament
whereas
the
species
whose
shell
is
prized
so
much
is
unfit
for
food
tortoise
shell
is
subjected
to
the
action
of
the
heat
the
outer
layer
peels
off
leaving
a
beautifully
marked
surface
which
is
susceptible
of
a
very
high
polish
the
sledge
quickly
received
its
second
load
from
the
raft
chests
four
and
the
were
placed
on
it
with
all
manner
of
smaller
articles
and
we
lost
no
time
in
returning
to
falconhurst
the
mother
welcomed
us
joyfully
for
she
said
we
had
been
regularly
overworked
during
the
last
two
days
however
now
you
are
come
home
to
rest
said
she
and
you
little
think
what
refreshment
awaits
you
here
in
the
shade
come
and
see
my
cellar
and
she
smilingly
exhibited
a
small
cask
half
sunk
in
the
ground
and
well
sheltered
with
leaves
and
branches
ah
you
wonder
where
this
came
from
continued
the
mother
well
i
found
it
myself
on
the
sands
while
you
were
all
absent
and
fancying
it
was
wine
of
some
sort
i
got
it
up
here
on
purpose
to
be
ready
for
you
the
boys
are
most
anxious
to
know
what
sort
of
wine
it
will
prove
to
be
as
the
simplest
method
of
ascertaining
this
i
inserted
a
straw
at
the
and
presently
announced
that
in
all
my
life
i
had
never
enjoyed
a
more
delicious
draught
of
canary
sack
the
mother
was
immensely
pleased
to
find
that
her
exertions
in
my
behalf
had
not
been
thrown
away
and
the
boys
pressed
around
me
armed
with
straws
and
begging
for
a
taste
after
so
strongly
expressing
my
own
enjoyment
of
the
wine
it
seemed
unreasonable
to
deny
them
this
and
i
let
them
come
in
turns
but
was
speedily
obliged
to
call
a
halt
for
the
rogues
got
so
eager
and
excited
that
i
had
to
reprove
them
for
their
greediness
and
warn
them
of
the
risk
they
ran
of
being
intoxicated
in
fact
i
blamed
myself
for
allowing
them
to
have
this
strong
wine
as
a
beverage
at
all
they
were
wholly
unaccustomed
to
it
and
were
besides
fatigued
and
very
hungry
supper
was
more
to
the
purpose
and
as
the
turtle
proved
delicious
it
was
heartily
enjoyed
and
gave
us
strength
to
haul
the
mattresses
we
had
brought
from
the
ship
up
into
our
sleeping
rooms
so
that
very
refreshing
slumbers
closed
the
day
early
next
morning
i
got
up
without
rousing
any
of
the
others
intending
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
beach
for
i
had
my
doubts
about
the
safety
of
my
vessels
on
the
open
shore
the
dogs
were
delighted
when
i
descended
the
ladder
and
bounded
to
meet
me
the
cocks
crowed
and
flapped
their
wings
two
pretty
kids
gamboled
around
all
was
life
and
energy
the
ass
alone
seemed
disinclined
to
begin
the
day
and
as
i
especially
required
his
services
this
was
unfortunate
i
put
his
morning
dreams
to
flight
however
and
harnessed
him
to
the
sledge
the
cow
as
she
had
not
been
milked
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
further
repose
and
with
the
rest
of
the
family
i
left
her
dozing
my
fears
as
to
the
safety
of
the
boats
were
soon
dispelled
for
they
were
all
right
and
being
in
haste
to
return
the
load
i
collected
from
their
freight
was
but
a
light
one
and
the
donkey
willingly
trotted
home
with
it
he
as
well
as
i
being
uncommonly
ready
for
breakfast
approaching
the
tree
not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
although
it
was
broad
day
and
great
was
my
good
wife
surprise
when
roused
by
the
clatter
and
hullabaloo
i
made
she
started
up
and
became
aware
of
the
late
hour
what
can
have
made
us
oversleep
like
this
she
exclaimed
it
must
be
the
fault
of
those
mattresses
they
are
delightful
but
really
too
lulling
see
the
children
are
sound
asleep
still
with
much
stretching
and
many
yawns
the
boys
at
last
came
tumbling
down
from
the
tree
rubbing
their
eyes
and
seeming
but
half
awake
ernest
last
as
usual
come
my
boys
said
i
this
will
never
do
your
beds
were
too
luxurious
last
night
i
see
in
my
own
opinion
however
i
felt
there
was
something
else
to
blame
besides
the
comfortable
mattresses
and
i
made
a
mental
resolve
that
the
captain
fine
canary
should
be
dealt
with
very
sparingly
in
future
so
now
for
prayers
and
breakfast
i
continued
and
then
off
to
work
i
must
have
our
cargo
landed
in
time
to
get
the
boats
off
with
the
next
tide
by
dint
of
downright
hard
work
we
accomplished
this
and
i
got
on
board
with
fritz
as
soon
as
they
were
afloat
the
rest
turned
homeward
but
jack
lingered
behind
with
such
imploring
looks
that
i
could
not
resist
taking
him
with
me
my
intention
had
been
simply
to
take
the
vessels
round
to
the
harbor
in
safety
bay
but
the
calm
sea
and
fine
weather
tempted
me
to
make
another
trip
to
the
wreck
it
took
up
more
time
than
i
expected
so
that
when
on
board
we
could
only
make
a
further
examination
of
the
cargo
collect
a
few
portable
articles
and
then
avail
ourselves
of
the
which
would
fail
us
later
in
the
evening
to
jack
the
pleasure
of
hunting
about
in
the
hold
was
novel
and
charming
and
very
soon
a
tremendous
rattling
and
clattering
heralded
his
approach
with
a
in
the
highest
spirits
at
his
good
fortune
in
having
found
such
a
capital
thing
in
which
to
bring
home
potatoes
he
was
followed
by
fritz
whose
news
was
still
more
important
he
had
found
carefully
packed
and
enclosed
within
partitions
what
appeared
to
be
the
separate
parts
of
a
pinnace
with
rigging
and
fittings
complete
even
to
a
couple
of
small
brass
guns
this
was
a
great
discovery
and
i
hastened
to
see
if
the
lad
was
right
indeed
he
was
but
my
pleasure
was
qualified
by
a
sense
of
the
arduous
task
it
would
be
to
put
such
a
craft
together
so
as
to
be
fit
for
sea
for
the
present
we
had
barely
time
to
get
something
to
eat
and
hurry
into
the
boat
where
were
collected
our
new
acquisitions
namely
a
copper
boiler
iron
plates
two
grindstones
a
small
barrel
of
powder
and
another
of
flints
two
besides
jack
which
he
kept
under
his
own
especial
care
as
we
drew
near
the
shore
we
were
surprised
to
see
a
number
of
little
figures
ranged
in
a
row
along
the
water
edge
and
apparently
gazing
fixedly
at
us
they
seemed
to
wear
dark
coats
and
white
waistcoats
and
stood
quite
still
with
their
arms
dropping
by
their
sides
only
every
now
and
then
one
would
extend
them
gently
as
though
longing
to
embrace
us
ah
here
at
last
come
the
pigmy
inhabitants
of
the
country
to
welcome
us
cried
i
laughing
oh
father
exclaimed
jack
i
hope
they
are
lilliputians
i
once
read
in
a
book
about
them
so
there
must
be
such
people
you
know
only
these
look
rather
too
large
you
must
be
content
to
give
up
the
lilliputians
and
accept
penguins
my
dear
jack
said
i
we
have
not
before
seen
them
in
such
numbers
but
ernest
knocked
one
down
if
you
remember
soon
after
we
landed
they
are
excellent
swimmers
but
helpless
on
land
as
they
can
neither
fly
nor
run
we
were
gradually
approaching
the
land
as
i
spoke
and
no
sooner
was
the
water
shallow
than
out
sprang
jack
from
his
tub
and
wading
ashore
took
the
unsuspecting
birds
by
surprise
and
with
his
stick
laid
half
a
dozen
right
and
left
either
stunned
or
dead
at
his
feet
the
rest
escaped
into
the
water
dived
and
disappeared
illustration
took
the
unsuspecting
birds
by
as
these
penguins
are
disagreeable
food
on
account
of
their
strong
oily
taste
i
was
sorry
jack
had
attacked
them
but
going
to
examine
them
when
we
landed
some
of
the
fallen
arose
from
their
swoon
and
began
solemnly
to
waddle
away
upon
which
we
caught
them
and
tying
their
feet
together
with
long
grass
laid
them
on
the
sand
to
wait
until
we
were
ready
to
start
the
three
then
each
received
a
load
the
live
penguins
seated
gravely
were
trundled
along
by
jack
and
away
we
went
at
a
great
rate
the
unusual
noise
of
our
approach
set
the
dogs
barking
furiously
but
discovering
us
they
rushed
forward
with
such
forcible
demonstrations
of
delight
that
poor
little
jack
who
as
it
was
could
scarcely
manage
his
barrow
was
fairly
upset
penguins
and
all
this
was
too
much
for
his
patience
and
it
was
absurd
to
see
how
he
started
up
and
cuffed
them
soundly
for
their
boisterous
behavior
this
scene
and
the
examination
of
our
burdens
caused
great
merriment
the
and
iron
plates
evidently
puzzling
everybody
i
sent
the
boys
to
catch
some
of
our
geese
and
ducks
and
bid
them
fasten
a
penguin
to
each
by
the
leg
thinking
that
it
was
worth
while
to
try
to
tame
them
my
wife
had
exerted
herself
in
our
absence
to
provide
a
good
store
of
potatoes
and
also
of
manioc
root
i
admired
her
industry
and
little
franz
said
ah
father
i
wonder
what
you
will
say
when
mother
and
i
give
you
some
indian
corn
and
melons
and
pumpkins
and
cucumbers
now
you
little
chatterbox
cried
she
you
have
let
out
my
secret
i
was
to
have
the
pleasure
of
surprising
your
father
when
my
plants
were
growing
up
ah
the
poor
disappointed
little
mother
said
i
never
mind
i
am
charmed
to
hear
about
it
only
do
tell
me
where
did
those
seeds
come
from
out
of
my
magic
bag
of
course
replied
she
and
each
time
i
have
gone
for
potatoes
i
have
sown
seeds
in
the
ground
which
was
dug
up
to
get
them
and
i
have
planted
potatoes
also
well
done
you
wise
little
woman
i
exclaimed
why
you
are
a
model
of
prudence
and
industry
but
continued
she
i
do
not
half
like
the
appearance
of
those
you
have
brought
is
it
possible
you
are
going
to
make
snuff
do
pray
let
us
make
sure
of
abundance
of
food
for
our
mouths
before
we
think
of
our
noses
make
your
mind
easy
my
wife
said
i
i
have
not
the
remotest
intention
of
introducing
the
dirty
ridiculous
habit
of
snuffing
into
your
family
please
to
treat
my
graters
with
respect
however
because
they
are
to
be
the
means
of
providing
you
with
the
first
fresh
bread
you
have
seen
this
many
a
long
day
what
possible
connection
can
there
be
between
bread
and
i
can
not
imagine
what
you
mean
and
to
talk
of
bread
where
there
are
no
ovens
is
only
tantalizing
ah
you
must
not
expect
real
loaves
said
i
but
on
these
flat
iron
plates
i
can
bake
flat
cakes
or
scones
which
will
be
excellent
bread
i
mean
to
try
at
once
what
i
can
do
with
ernest
roots
and
first
of
all
i
want
you
to
make
me
a
nice
strong
canvas
bag
this
the
mother
willingly
undertook
to
do
but
she
evidently
had
not
much
faith
in
my
powers
as
a
baker
and
i
saw
her
set
on
a
good
potful
of
potatoes
before
beginning
to
work
as
though
to
make
sure
of
a
meal
without
depending
on
my
bread
spreading
a
piece
of
sailcloth
on
the
ground
i
summoned
my
boys
to
set
to
work
each
took
a
grater
and
a
supply
of
manioc
root
and
when
all
were
seated
round
the
cloth
once
twice
thrice
off
cried
i
beginning
to
rub
a
root
as
hard
as
i
could
against
the
rough
surface
of
my
grater
my
example
was
instantly
followed
by
the
whole
party
amid
bursts
of
merriment
as
each
remarked
the
funny
attitude
and
odd
gestures
of
his
neighbors
while
vehemently
rubbing
rasping
grating
and
grinding
down
the
roots
allotted
to
him
no
one
was
tempted
by
the
look
of
the
flour
to
stop
and
taste
it
for
in
truth
it
looked
much
like
wet
sawdust
cassava
bread
is
highly
esteemed
in
many
parts
of
the
new
world
and
i
have
even
heard
that
some
europeans
there
prefer
it
to
the
wheaten
bread
of
their
own
country
there
are
various
species
of
manioc
one
sort
grows
quickly
and
its
roots
ripen
in
a
very
short
time
another
kind
is
of
somewhat
slower
growth
the
roots
of
the
third
kind
do
not
come
to
maturity
for
two
years
the
two
first
are
poisonous
if
eaten
raw
yet
they
are
preferred
to
the
third
which
is
harmless
because
they
are
so
much
more
fruitful
and
the
flour
produced
is
excellent
if
the
scrapings
are
carefully
pressed
what
is
the
good
of
pressing
them
father
inquired
ernest
it
is
in
order
to
express
the
sap
which
contains
the
poison
the
dry
pith
is
wholesome
and
nourishing
still
i
do
not
mean
to
taste
my
cakes
until
i
have
tried
their
effect
on
our
fowls
and
the
ape
by
this
time
our
supply
of
roots
being
reduced
to
damp
powder
the
canvas
bag
was
filled
with
it
and
tying
it
tightly
up
i
attempted
to
squeeze
it
but
soon
found
that
mechanical
aid
was
necessary
in
order
to
express
the
moisture
my
arrangements
for
this
purpose
were
as
follows
a
strong
straight
beam
was
made
flat
on
one
side
smooth
planks
were
laid
across
two
of
the
lower
roots
of
our
tree
on
these
we
placed
the
sack
above
the
sack
another
plank
and
over
that
the
long
beam
one
end
was
passed
under
a
root
near
the
sack
the
other
projected
far
forward
and
to
that
we
attached
all
the
heaviest
weights
we
could
think
of
such
as
an
anvil
iron
bars
and
masses
of
lead
the
consequent
pressure
on
the
bag
was
enormous
and
the
sap
flowed
from
it
to
the
ground
will
this
stuff
keep
any
time
inquired
my
wife
who
came
to
see
how
we
were
getting
on
or
must
all
this
great
bagful
be
used
at
once
in
that
case
we
shall
have
to
spend
the
whole
of
in
baking
cakes
not
at
all
i
replied
once
dry
the
flour
in
barrels
will
keep
fresh
a
long
time
we
shall
use
a
great
deal
of
this
however
as
you
shall
see
do
you
think
we
might
begin
now
father
said
fritz
there
does
not
seem
the
least
moisture
remaining
certainly
said
i
but
i
shall
only
make
one
cake
for
an
experiment
we
must
see
how
it
agrees
with
master
knips
and
the
hens
before
we
set
up
a
bakehouse
in
regular
style
i
took
out
a
couple
of
handfuls
of
flour
for
this
purpose
and
with
a
stick
loosened
and
stirred
the
remainder
which
i
intended
should
again
be
pressed
while
an
iron
plate
placed
over
a
good
fire
was
getting
hot
i
mixed
the
meal
with
water
and
a
little
salt
kneaded
it
well
and
forming
a
thickish
cake
laid
it
on
the
hot
plate
when
one
side
presently
becoming
a
nice
color
it
was
turned
and
was
quickly
baked
it
smelt
so
delicious
that
the
boys
quite
envied
the
two
hens
and
the
monkey
who
were
selected
as
the
subjects
of
this
interesting
experiment
and
they
silently
watched
them
gobbling
up
the
bits
of
cake
i
gave
them
until
fritz
turned
to
me
saying
suppose
the
cake
is
poisonous
what
effect
will
it
have
on
the
creatures
will
they
be
stupefied
or
will
they
suffer
pain
that
depends
upon
the
nature
of
the
poison
some
cause
violent
pain
as
colchicum
hellebore
and
aconite
others
produce
stupefaction
and
paralysis
as
opium
hemlock
and
prussic
acid
while
others
again
as
strychnine
are
followed
by
violent
convulsions
or
as
belladonna
by
delirium
the
effects
of
course
vary
according
to
the
quantity
taken
and
such
remedies
should
be
applied
as
will
best
counteract
the
effect
of
each
poison
emetics
in
any
case
to
remove
as
much
as
possible
of
the
noxious
substance
combined
with
oils
and
mucilaginous
drinks
to
soothe
and
protect
the
stomach
in
the
case
of
irritants
stimulants
such
as
spirits
ammonia
or
strong
coffee
to
rouse
from
the
stupor
of
the
narcotics
and
sedative
drugs
which
are
perhaps
in
themselves
poisons
to
counteract
the
over
stimulation
of
the
nerves
caused
by
the
convulsant
poisons
but
now
let
us
think
no
more
of
poisons
here
is
supper
ready
and
we
need
not
be
afraid
to
eat
roast
penguin
and
potatoes
no
sooner
said
than
done
we
left
the
fowls
picking
up
the
least
crumb
they
could
find
of
the
questionable
food
and
assembled
to
enjoy
our
evening
meal
the
potatoes
were
as
usual
excellent
the
penguin
really
not
so
bad
as
i
expected
although
fishy
in
taste
and
very
tough
next
morning
everyone
expressed
the
tenderest
concern
as
to
the
health
of
knips
and
the
hens
and
lively
pleasure
was
in
every
countenance
when
jack
who
ran
first
to
make
the
visit
of
inquiry
brought
news
of
their
perfect
good
health
and
spirits
no
time
was
now
to
be
lost
and
the
commenced
in
earnest
a
large
fire
was
kindled
the
plates
heated
the
meal
made
into
cakes
each
of
the
boys
busily
preparing
his
own
and
watching
the
baking
most
eagerly
mistakes
occurred
of
course
some
of
the
bread
was
burnt
some
not
done
enough
but
a
pile
of
nice
tempting
cakes
was
at
length
ready
and
with
plenty
of
good
milk
we
breakfasted
right
royally
and
in
high
spirits
at
our
success
soon
after
while
feeding
the
poultry
with
the
fragments
of
the
repast
i
observed
that
the
captive
penguins
were
quite
at
ease
among
them
and
as
tame
as
the
geese
and
ducks
their
bonds
were
therefore
loosed
and
they
were
left
as
free
as
the
other
fowls
chapter
vi
how
we
built
the
pinnace
having
now
discovered
how
to
provide
bread
for
my
family
my
thoughts
began
to
revert
to
the
wreck
and
all
the
valuables
yet
contained
within
it
above
all
i
was
bent
on
acquiring
possession
of
the
beautiful
pinnace
and
aware
that
our
united
efforts
would
be
required
to
do
the
necessary
work
i
began
to
coax
and
persuade
the
mother
to
let
me
go
in
force
with
all
her
boys
except
franz
she
very
unwillingly
gave
her
consent
at
last
but
not
until
i
had
faithfully
promised
never
to
pass
a
night
on
board
i
did
so
with
reluctance
and
we
parted
neither
feeling
quite
satisfied
with
the
arrangement
the
boys
were
delighted
to
go
in
so
large
a
party
and
merrily
carried
provision
bags
filled
with
cassava
bread
and
potatoes
reaching
safety
bay
without
adventure
we
first
paid
a
visit
to
the
geese
and
ducks
which
inhabited
the
marsh
there
and
having
fed
them
and
seen
they
were
thriving
well
we
buckled
on
each
his
cork
belt
stepped
into
the
and
with
the
raft
in
tow
steered
straight
for
the
wreck
when
we
got
on
board
i
desired
the
boys
to
collect
whatever
came
first
to
hand
and
load
the
raft
to
be
ready
for
our
return
at
night
and
then
we
made
a
minute
inspection
of
the
pinnace
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
difficulties
well
nigh
insuperable
lay
between
me
and
the
safe
possession
of
the
beautiful
little
vessel
she
lay
in
a
most
position
at
the
further
end
of
the
hold
stowed
in
so
confined
and
narrow
a
space
that
it
was
impossible
to
think
of
fitting
the
parts
together
there
at
the
same
time
these
parts
were
so
heavy
that
removing
them
to
a
convenient
place
piece
by
piece
was
equally
out
of
the
question
i
sent
the
boys
away
to
amuse
themselves
by
rummaging
out
anything
they
liked
to
carry
away
and
sat
down
quietly
to
consider
the
matter
as
my
eyes
became
used
to
the
dim
light
which
entered
the
compartment
through
a
chink
or
crevice
here
and
there
i
perceived
how
carefully
every
part
of
the
pinnace
was
arranged
and
marked
with
numbers
so
that
if
only
i
could
bestow
sufficient
time
on
the
work
and
contrive
space
in
which
to
execute
it
i
might
reasonably
hope
for
success
room
room
to
work
in
boys
that
what
we
need
in
the
first
place
i
cried
as
my
sons
came
to
see
what
plan
i
had
devised
for
so
great
was
their
reliance
on
me
that
they
never
doubted
the
pinnace
was
to
be
ours
fetch
axes
and
let
us
break
down
the
compartment
and
clear
space
all
round
to
work
we
all
went
yet
evening
drew
near
and
but
little
impression
was
made
on
the
mass
of
woodwork
around
us
we
had
to
acknowledge
that
an
immense
amount
of
labor
and
perseverance
would
be
required
before
we
could
call
ourselves
the
owners
of
the
useful
and
elegant
little
craft
which
lay
within
this
vast
hulk
like
a
fossil
shell
embedded
in
a
rock
preparations
for
returning
to
shore
were
hastily
made
and
we
landed
without
much
relish
for
the
long
walk
to
falconhurst
when
to
our
great
surprise
and
pleasure
we
found
the
mother
and
little
franz
at
tentholm
awaiting
us
she
had
resolved
to
take
up
her
quarters
there
during
the
time
we
should
be
engaged
on
the
wreck
in
that
way
you
will
live
nearer
your
work
and
i
shall
not
quite
lose
sight
of
you
said
she
with
a
pleasant
smile
you
are
a
good
sensible
kind
wife
i
exclaimed
delighted
with
her
plan
and
we
shall
work
with
the
greater
diligence
that
you
may
return
as
soon
as
possible
to
your
dear
falconhurst
come
and
see
what
we
have
brought
you
mother
cried
fritz
a
good
addition
to
your
stores
is
it
not
and
he
and
his
brothers
exhibited
two
small
casks
of
butter
three
of
flour
corn
rice
and
many
other
articles
welcome
to
our
careful
housewife
our
days
were
now
spent
in
hard
work
on
board
first
cutting
and
clearing
an
open
space
round
the
pinnace
and
then
putting
the
parts
together
we
started
early
and
returned
at
night
bringing
each
time
a
valuable
freight
from
the
old
vessel
at
length
with
incredible
labor
all
was
completed
the
pinnace
stood
actually
ready
to
be
launched
but
imprisoned
within
massive
wooden
walls
which
defied
our
strength
it
seemed
exactly
as
though
the
graceful
vessel
had
awakened
from
sleep
and
was
longing
to
spring
into
the
free
blue
sea
and
spread
her
wings
to
the
breeze
i
could
not
bear
to
think
that
our
success
so
far
should
be
followed
by
failure
and
disappointment
yet
no
possible
means
of
setting
her
free
could
i
conceive
and
i
was
almost
in
despair
when
an
idea
occurred
to
me
which
if
i
could
carry
it
out
would
effect
her
release
without
further
labor
or
delay
without
explaining
my
purpose
i
got
a
large
mortar
filled
it
with
gunpowder
secured
a
block
of
oak
to
the
top
through
which
i
pierced
a
hole
for
the
insertion
of
the
match
and
this
great
petard
i
so
placed
that
when
it
exploded
it
should
blow
out
the
side
of
the
vessel
next
which
the
pinnace
lay
then
securing
it
with
chains
that
the
recoil
might
do
no
damage
i
told
the
boys
i
was
going
ashore
earlier
than
usual
and
calmly
desired
them
to
get
into
the
boat
then
lighting
a
match
i
had
prepared
and
which
would
burn
some
time
before
reaching
the
powder
i
hastened
after
them
with
a
beating
heart
and
we
made
for
the
land
we
brought
the
raft
close
in
shore
and
began
to
unload
it
the
other
boat
i
did
not
haul
up
but
kept
her
ready
to
put
off
at
a
notice
my
anxiety
was
unobserved
by
anyone
as
i
listened
with
strained
nerves
for
the
expected
sound
it
came
a
flash
a
mighty
roar
a
grand
burst
of
smoke
my
wife
and
children
turned
their
eyes
toward
the
sea
whence
the
startling
noise
came
and
then
in
fear
and
wonder
looked
to
me
for
some
explanation
perhaps
said
the
mother
as
i
did
not
speak
perhaps
you
have
left
a
light
burning
near
some
of
the
gunpowder
and
an
explosion
has
taken
place
not
at
all
unlikely
replied
i
quietly
we
had
a
fire
below
when
we
were
calking
the
seams
of
the
pinnace
i
shall
go
off
at
once
and
see
what
has
happened
will
anyone
come
the
boys
needed
no
second
invitation
but
sprang
into
the
boat
while
i
lingered
to
reassure
my
wife
by
whispering
a
few
words
of
explanation
and
then
joining
them
we
pulled
for
the
wreck
at
a
more
rapid
rate
than
we
ever
had
done
before
no
alteration
had
taken
place
in
the
side
at
which
we
usually
boarded
her
and
we
pulled
round
to
the
further
side
where
a
marvelous
sight
awaited
us
a
huge
rent
appeared
the
decks
and
bulwarks
were
torn
open
the
water
was
covered
with
floating
wreckage
all
seemed
in
ruins
and
the
compartment
where
the
pinnace
rested
was
fully
revealed
to
view
there
sat
the
little
beauty
to
all
appearance
uninjured
and
the
boys
whose
attention
was
taken
up
with
the
melancholy
scene
of
ruin
and
confusion
around
them
were
astonished
to
hear
me
shout
in
enthusiastic
delight
hurrah
she
is
ours
the
lovely
pinnace
is
won
we
shall
be
able
to
launch
her
easily
after
all
come
boys
let
us
see
if
she
has
suffered
from
the
explosion
which
has
set
her
free
the
boys
gazed
at
me
for
a
moment
and
then
guessing
my
secret
you
planned
it
yourself
you
clever
cunning
father
oh
that
machine
we
helped
to
make
was
on
purpose
to
blow
it
up
cried
they
and
eagerly
they
followed
me
into
the
shattered
opening
where
to
my
intense
satisfaction
i
found
everything
as
i
could
wish
and
the
captive
in
no
way
a
sufferer
from
the
violent
measures
i
had
adopted
for
her
deliverance
the
boys
were
deeply
interested
in
examining
the
effects
of
the
explosion
and
in
the
explanation
i
gave
them
of
the
principle
and
proper
way
to
manage
a
petard
it
was
evident
that
the
launch
could
now
be
effected
without
much
trouble
i
had
been
careful
to
place
rollers
beneath
the
keel
so
that
by
means
of
levers
and
pulleys
we
might
with
our
united
strength
move
her
forward
toward
the
water
a
rope
was
attached
by
which
to
regulate
the
speed
of
the
descent
and
then
all
hands
putting
their
shoulders
to
the
work
the
pinnace
began
to
slide
from
the
stocks
and
finally
slipped
gently
and
steadily
into
the
water
where
she
floated
as
if
conscious
it
was
her
native
element
while
we
wild
with
excitement
cheered
and
waved
enthusiastically
we
then
only
remained
long
enough
to
secure
our
prize
carefully
at
the
most
sheltered
point
and
went
back
to
tentholm
where
we
accounted
for
the
explosion
saying
that
having
blown
away
one
side
of
the
ship
we
should
be
able
to
obtain
the
rest
of
its
contents
with
a
very
few
more
days
work
these
days
were
devoted
to
completing
the
rigging
the
mounting
of
her
two
little
brass
guns
and
all
necessary
arrangements
about
the
pinnace
it
was
wonderful
what
martial
ardor
was
awakened
by
the
possession
of
a
vessel
armed
with
two
real
guns
the
boys
chattered
incessantly
about
savages
fleets
of
canoes
attack
defense
and
final
annihilation
of
the
invaders
i
assured
them
that
brilliant
as
their
victories
would
doubtless
be
we
should
have
good
cause
to
thank
god
if
their
fighting
powers
and
valor
were
never
put
to
the
test
the
pinnace
was
fully
equipped
and
ready
to
sail
while
yet
no
idea
of
the
surprise
we
were
preparing
for
her
had
dawned
upon
my
wife
and
i
permitted
the
boys
who
had
kept
the
secret
so
well
to
fire
a
salute
when
we
entered
the
bay
casting
off
from
the
ship
and
spreading
the
sail
our
voyage
began
the
pinnace
glided
swiftly
through
the
water
i
stood
at
the
helm
ernest
and
jack
manned
the
guns
and
fritz
gave
the
word
of
command
fire
bang
bang
rattled
out
a
thrilling
report
which
echoed
and
among
the
cliffs
followed
by
our
shouts
and
hurrahs
the
mother
and
her
little
boy
rushed
hastily
forward
from
near
the
tent
and
we
could
plainly
see
their
alarm
and
astonishment
but
speedily
recognizing
us
they
waved
joyfully
and
came
quickly
to
the
landing
place
to
meet
us
by
skillful
management
we
brought
the
pinnace
near
a
projection
of
the
bank
and
fritz
assisted
his
mother
to
come
on
board
where
breathless
with
haste
and
excitement
she
exclaimed
you
dear
horrid
wonderful
people
shall
i
scold
you
or
praise
you
you
have
frightened
me
out
of
my
wits
to
see
a
beautiful
little
ship
come
sailing
in
was
startling
enough
for
i
could
not
conceive
who
might
be
on
board
but
the
report
of
your
guns
made
me
tremble
with
fear
and
had
i
not
recognized
your
voices
directly
after
i
should
have
run
away
with
franz
heaven
knows
where
but
have
you
really
done
all
this
work
yourselves
she
continued
when
we
had
been
forgiven
for
terrifying
her
with
our
vainglorious
salute
what
a
charming
little
yacht
i
should
not
be
afraid
to
sail
in
this
myself
after
the
pinnace
had
been
shown
off
and
received
the
admiration
she
deserved
while
our
industry
skill
and
perseverance
met
with
boundless
praise
now
said
my
wife
you
must
come
with
me
and
see
how
little
franz
and
i
have
improved
our
time
every
day
of
your
absence
we
all
landed
and
with
great
curiosity
followed
the
mother
up
the
river
toward
the
cascade
where
to
our
astonishment
we
found
a
garden
neatly
laid
out
in
beds
and
walks
and
she
continued
we
do
frighten
people
by
firing
salutes
in
honor
of
our
performances
although
by
and
by
i
too
shall
want
fire
in
a
peaceable
form
look
at
my
beds
of
lettuce
and
cabbages
my
rows
of
beans
and
peas
think
what
delicious
dinner
i
shall
be
able
to
cook
for
you
and
give
me
credit
for
my
diligence
my
dear
wife
i
exclaimed
this
is
beautiful
you
have
done
wonders
did
you
not
find
the
work
too
hard
the
ground
is
light
and
easy
to
dig
hereabouts
she
replied
i
have
planted
potatoes
and
cassava
roots
there
is
space
for
and
the
young
fruit
trees
and
i
shall
want
you
to
contrive
to
irrigate
them
by
leading
water
from
the
cascades
in
hollow
bamboos
up
by
the
sheltering
rocks
i
mean
to
have
and
melons
they
will
look
splendid
when
they
spread
there
to
shelter
the
beds
of
european
vegetables
from
the
heat
of
the
sun
i
have
planted
seeds
of
maize
round
them
the
shadow
of
the
tall
plants
will
afford
protection
from
the
burning
rays
do
you
think
that
is
a
good
plan
i
do
indeed
the
whole
arrangement
is
capital
now
as
sunset
approaches
we
must
return
to
the
tent
for
supper
and
rest
for
both
of
which
we
are
all
quite
ready
the
time
passed
in
happy
talk
over
our
many
new
interests
everyone
had
the
pleasant
sensation
which
attends
successful
labor
as
well
as
experiencing
the
joy
of
affording
unexpected
pleasure
to
others
and
i
especially
pointed
out
to
my
sons
how
true
genuine
happiness
consists
in
that
rather
than
in
mere
next
morning
my
wife
said
if
you
can
exist
on
shore
long
enough
to
visit
falconhurst
dear
husband
i
should
like
you
to
attend
to
the
little
fruit
trees
i
fear
they
have
been
too
much
neglected
i
have
watered
them
occasionally
and
spread
earth
over
the
roots
as
they
lay
but
i
could
not
manage
to
plant
them
you
have
done
far
more
than
i
could
have
expected
my
wife
i
replied
and
provided
you
do
not
ask
me
to
give
up
the
sea
altogether
i
most
willingly
agree
to
your
request
and
will
go
to
falconhurst
as
soon
as
the
raft
is
unloaded
and
everything
safely
arranged
here
life
on
shore
was
an
agreeable
change
for
us
all
and
the
boys
went
actively
to
work
so
that
the
stores
were
quickly
brought
up
to
the
tent
piled
in
order
and
carefully
covered
with
sailcloths
fastened
down
by
pegs
all
round
the
pinnace
being
provided
with
an
anchor
was
properly
moored
and
her
elegant
appearance
quite
altered
the
looks
of
our
harbor
hitherto
occupied
only
by
the
grotesque
and
flat
uninteresting
raft
taking
an
ample
supply
of
everything
we
should
require
at
falconhurst
we
were
soon
comfortably
in
that
charming
abode
its
peaceful
shade
seeming
more
delightful
than
ever
after
the
heat
and
hard
work
we
had
lately
undergone
several
sundays
had
passed
during
our
stay
at
tentholm
and
the
welcome
day
of
rest
now
returned
again
to
be
observed
with
heartfelt
devotion
and
grateful
praise
i
did
not
attempt
too
much
in
the
form
of
preaching
as
i
could
not
have
secured
the
attention
of
my
hearers
to
any
discourse
but
they
were
interested
in
the
bible
reading
and
simple
instructions
i
drew
from
it
and
their
young
voices
joined
sweetly
in
favorite
hymns
which
my
wife
sang
from
memory
in
the
evening
i
desired
the
boys
to
let
me
see
their
dexterity
in
athletic
exercises
such
as
running
leaping
wrestling
and
climbing
telling
them
they
must
keep
up
the
practice
of
these
things
so
as
to
grow
strong
active
men
powerful
to
repel
and
cope
with
danger
as
well
as
agile
and
to
escape
from
it
no
man
can
be
really
courageous
and
without
an
inward
consciousness
of
physical
power
and
capability
i
want
to
see
my
sons
strong
both
morally
and
physically
said
i
that
means
little
franz
as
the
large
blue
eyes
looked
inquiringly
up
at
me
brave
to
do
what
is
good
and
right
and
to
hate
evil
and
strong
to
work
hunt
and
provide
for
themselves
and
others
and
to
fight
if
necessary
on
the
following
day
the
boys
seeming
disposed
to
carry
out
my
wishes
by
muscular
exercise
of
all
sorts
i
encouraged
them
by
saying
i
meant
to
prepare
a
curious
new
weapon
for
them
only
they
must
promise
not
to
neglect
the
practice
of
archery
as
to
their
guns
i
had
no
reason
to
fear
they
would
be
laid
aside
taking
a
long
cord
i
attached
a
leaden
bullet
to
each
end
and
had
instantly
to
answer
a
storm
of
questions
as
to
what
this
could
possibly
be
for
this
is
a
miniature
lasso
said
i
the
mexicans
patagonians
and
various
tribes
of
south
america
make
use
of
this
weapon
in
hunting
with
marvelous
dexterity
only
having
no
bullets
they
fasten
stones
to
their
ropes
which
are
immensely
longer
than
this
one
end
is
swung
round
and
round
the
mounted
hunter
head
and
then
cast
with
skill
and
precision
toward
the
animal
he
wishes
to
strike
immediately
drawing
it
back
he
can
repeat
the
blow
and
either
kill
or
wound
his
prey
frequently
however
the
intention
is
to
take
the
animal
wild
horse
or
buffalo
or
whatever
it
may
be
alive
and
in
that
case
the
lasso
is
thrown
while
riding
in
hot
pursuit
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
the
stone
twist
many
times
round
the
neck
body
or
legs
of
the
fugitive
arresting
him
even
in
full
career
oh
father
what
a
splendid
contrivance
will
you
try
it
now
there
is
the
donkey
father
do
catch
the
donkey
not
at
all
certain
of
my
powers
i
declined
to
practice
upon
a
live
subject
but
consented
to
make
a
trial
of
skill
by
aiming
at
the
stump
of
a
tree
at
no
great
distance
my
success
surpassed
my
own
expectations
the
stump
was
entwined
by
the
cord
in
such
a
way
as
to
leave
no
doubt
whatever
as
to
the
feasibility
of
the
wonderful
performances
i
described
and
i
was
assailed
by
petitions
from
the
boys
each
anxious
to
possess
a
lasso
of
his
own
without
a
moment
delay
as
the
manufacture
was
simple
their
wishes
were
speedily
gratified
and
lasso
practice
became
the
order
of
the
day
fritz
who
was
the
most
active
and
adroit
besides
having
of
course
the
greatest
muscular
strength
soon
became
skilled
in
the
art
that
night
a
change
came
over
the
weather
and
early
next
morning
i
perceived
that
a
gale
of
wind
was
getting
up
from
the
height
of
our
trees
i
could
see
that
the
surface
of
the
sea
was
in
violent
agitation
it
was
with
no
small
satisfaction
that
i
thought
of
our
pinnace
safely
moored
in
the
harbor
and
recollected
that
there
was
nothing
to
call
us
to
the
wreck
for
the
next
few
days
my
attention
was
by
no
means
monopolized
by
my
sons
and
their
amusements
the
good
mother
had
much
to
show
me
demanding
my
approval
advice
or
assistance
as
the
case
might
be
a
good
supply
of
wild
pigeons
and
ortolans
had
been
snared
partly
cooked
and
preserved
in
lard
of
these
she
showed
me
her
small
cask
well
filled
then
the
nests
of
various
pairs
of
tame
pigeons
were
exhibited
but
her
chief
care
was
the
unpromising
condition
of
her
dear
little
fruit
trees
for
having
been
forgotten
they
were
so
dry
and
withered
that
unless
planted
without
further
delay
she
feared
we
should
lose
them
this
needful
work
we
set
about
therefore
at
once
proposing
afterward
an
excursion
to
the
calabash
wood
in
order
to
manufacture
a
large
supply
of
vessels
and
utensils
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
everyone
was
inclined
for
this
expedition
consequently
the
planting
of
the
orchard
was
carried
on
with
surprising
vigor
but
was
not
completed
until
toward
evening
and
then
all
sorts
of
arrangements
were
made
for
an
early
start
next
day
the
mother
and
franz
were
to
be
of
the
party
and
their
equipment
took
some
time
for
we
meant
to
make
a
grand
family
excursion
attended
by
our
domestic
pets
and
servants
by
sunrise
we
were
all
astir
and
everything
quickly
made
ready
for
a
start
the
sledge
loaded
with
ammunition
and
baskets
of
provisions
and
drawn
by
the
donkey
was
to
be
used
for
carrying
home
our
gourd
manufactures
as
well
as
any
other
prize
we
might
fall
in
with
turk
as
usual
headed
the
procession
clad
in
his
coat
of
mail
then
came
the
boys
with
their
guns
and
game
bags
their
mother
and
i
followed
and
behind
trotted
juno
not
in
very
good
spirits
poor
dog
because
master
knips
who
had
no
idea
of
being
left
alone
must
needs
ride
on
her
back
on
this
occasion
i
took
two
guns
with
me
one
loaded
with
shot
for
game
another
with
ball
for
our
defense
against
beasts
of
prey
flamingo
marsh
was
quickly
crossed
and
the
magnificent
country
beyond
lay
extended
in
all
its
beauty
and
fertility
before
our
eyes
it
was
new
to
my
wife
and
two
of
the
boys
and
the
lovely
prospect
enchanted
them
here
fritz
and
jack
turned
aside
into
the
bush
where
presently
loud
barking
was
followed
by
the
quick
report
of
a
gun
and
a
large
bird
which
had
risen
from
the
thicket
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
before
us
far
from
resigning
itself
however
to
death
or
captivity
it
sprung
to
its
feet
and
unable
to
fly
rushed
away
with
extraordinary
speed
hotly
pursued
by
the
excited
dog
while
fritz
ran
panting
in
the
same
direction
and
juno
eager
to
join
the
chase
sprang
aside
so
suddenly
that
her
rider
was
flung
unceremoniously
on
the
sand
as
she
darted
to
intercept
the
retreat
of
the
active
bird
this
she
cleverly
accomplished
but
its
defense
was
maintained
so
fiercely
as
it
struck
out
with
its
powerful
legs
and
sharp
claws
that
neither
fritz
nor
the
dogs
could
master
it
i
hastened
to
their
assistance
and
found
juno
holding
on
nobly
by
the
wing
she
had
seized
while
the
bird
which
proved
to
be
a
magnificent
bustard
struggled
and
fought
fiercely
watching
my
opportunity
i
threw
a
large
handkerchief
over
it
and
with
difficulty
succeeded
in
binding
its
legs
and
wings
it
was
borne
in
triumph
to
the
rest
of
our
party
who
meantime
had
been
reclining
on
the
sand
what
have
you
got
what
has
fritz
shot
cried
the
boys
starting
up
at
our
approach
a
bustard
oh
that
is
splendid
to
be
sure
it
is
the
one
we
missed
that
day
do
you
remember
mother
ah
ha
old
fellow
you
are
done
for
this
time
said
jack
i
think
this
is
a
hen
bustard
it
is
the
mother
bird
said
ernest
ah
yes
poor
thing
exclaimed
my
wife
in
a
tone
of
concern
it
is
most
likely
the
same
and
i
know
she
had
a
brood
of
young
birds
and
now
they
will
be
left
unprotected
and
miserable
had
we
not
better
let
her
go
why
my
dear
wife
that
was
weeks
and
weeks
ago
those
little
birds
are
all
strong
and
big
by
this
time
and
i
dare
say
bustard
here
has
forgotten
all
about
them
besides
she
is
badly
wounded
and
we
must
try
to
cure
the
hurt
if
we
succeed
she
will
be
a
valuable
addition
to
our
poultry
yard
if
we
can
not
you
shall
roast
her
for
dinner
resuming
our
march
we
next
arrived
at
the
monkey
grove
which
was
the
scene
of
the
adventure
by
which
fritz
became
the
guardian
of
the
orphan
ape
while
he
amused
us
all
by
a
lively
and
graphic
description
of
the
scene
ernest
was
standing
apart
under
a
splendid
cocoanut
palm
gazing
in
fixed
admiration
at
the
grand
height
of
the
stem
and
its
beautiful
graceful
crown
of
leaves
the
cluster
of
nuts
beneath
these
evidently
added
interest
to
the
spectacle
for
drawing
quietly
near
him
i
heard
a
sigh
and
the
words
it
awfully
high
i
wish
one
would
fall
down
scarcely
had
he
uttered
these
words
than
as
if
by
magic
down
plumped
a
huge
nut
at
his
feet
the
boy
was
quite
startled
and
sprang
aside
looking
timidly
upward
when
to
my
surprise
down
came
another
why
this
is
just
like
the
fairy
tale
of
the
cried
ernest
my
wish
is
granted
as
soon
as
formed
i
suspect
the
fairy
in
this
instance
is
more
anxious
to
pelt
us
and
drive
us
away
than
to
bestow
dainty
gifts
upon
us
said
i
i
think
there
is
most
likely
a
old
ape
sitting
up
among
those
shadowy
leaves
and
branches
we
examined
the
nuts
thinking
they
were
perhaps
old
ones
and
had
fallen
in
consequence
naturally
but
they
were
not
even
quite
ripe
anxious
to
discover
what
was
in
the
tree
we
all
surrounded
it
gaping
and
gazing
upward
with
curious
eyes
hullo
i
see
him
shouted
fritz
presently
oh
a
hideous
creature
what
can
it
be
flat
round
as
big
as
a
plate
and
with
a
pair
of
horrid
claws
here
he
comes
he
is
going
to
creep
down
the
tree
at
this
little
franz
slipped
behind
his
mother
ernest
took
a
glance
round
to
mark
a
place
of
retreat
jack
raised
the
of
his
gun
and
every
eye
was
fixed
on
the
trunk
of
the
tree
down
which
a
large
commenced
a
leisurely
descent
as
it
approached
within
reach
jack
hit
at
it
boldly
when
it
suddenly
dropped
the
remaining
distance
and
opening
its
great
claws
sidled
after
him
with
considerable
rapidity
upon
which
he
fairly
turned
tail
and
ran
we
all
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
which
soon
made
him
face
about
and
then
to
our
infinite
amusement
the
little
fellow
prepared
for
a
fresh
onset
laying
down
all
he
was
carrying
pulling
off
his
jacket
and
spreading
it
wide
out
in
both
hands
he
returned
to
the
charge
suddenly
threw
his
garment
over
the
creature
wrapped
it
well
round
it
and
then
pummeled
it
with
all
the
strength
of
his
fists
for
a
few
minutes
i
could
do
nothing
but
laugh
but
then
running
to
him
with
my
hatchet
i
struck
several
sharp
blows
on
his
bundle
which
we
opened
carefully
and
found
within
the
perfectly
dead
well
this
is
an
ugly
rascal
cried
jack
if
he
had
been
so
hideous
i
should
not
have
dealt
so
severely
with
him
i
was
a
bit
afraid
what
is
the
creature
name
this
is
a
crab
a
said
i
of
which
there
are
many
varieties
and
this
i
think
is
called
a
cocoanut
crab
or
at
least
it
deserves
the
name
for
it
is
evidently
very
fond
of
eating
these
nuts
since
it
takes
the
trouble
to
climb
the
trees
for
them
the
difficulty
of
getting
at
the
kernel
too
is
considerable
you
showed
no
little
presence
of
mind
jack
when
you
thought
of
catching
it
in
your
jacket
in
fact
it
might
have
been
more
than
a
match
for
you
otherwise
for
some
are
most
determined
fighters
and
are
very
swift
too
now
let
us
take
it
as
well
as
the
nuts
to
the
sledge
and
go
on
our
way
progress
became
difficult
for
we
were
constantly
stopped
in
passing
through
the
wood
by
having
to
cut
away
the
hanging
boughs
and
creeping
plants
which
interlaced
them
ernest
was
behind
and
called
me
back
to
see
what
proved
to
be
an
important
discovery
from
the
several
stalks
of
one
of
these
creepers
flowed
clear
cold
water
and
i
recognized
the
liane
rouge
which
is
known
in
america
and
is
so
precious
to
the
thirsty
hunter
or
traveler
this
is
truly
one
of
good
gifts
to
man
the
boys
were
much
delighted
with
this
curious
plant
only
fancy
mother
said
ernest
as
he
showed
it
to
her
how
cheering
and
refreshing
to
find
this
if
one
were
lost
and
alone
in
a
vast
forest
wandering
for
days
and
days
without
being
near
a
natural
spring
of
water
but
are
you
certain
it
is
safe
to
drink
this
asked
she
i
assured
her
it
was
so
and
advised
the
boys
to
cut
enough
to
quench
the
thirst
of
the
whole
party
including
our
animals
this
they
did
only
finding
it
necessary
as
with
the
to
cut
air
holes
above
the
joints
after
struggling
onward
for
a
short
time
we
emerged
from
the
thickets
into
open
ground
and
saw
the
calabash
trees
in
the
distance
as
we
drew
near
their
curious
appearance
and
singular
fruit
caused
much
surprise
and
also
amusement
for
we
were
speedily
established
among
the
trees
where
as
i
chose
and
cut
down
the
gourds
most
likely
to
be
useful
everyone
engaged
merrily
in
the
work
of
cutting
carving
sawing
and
scooping
some
manner
of
dish
bowl
cup
jar
or
platter
according
to
his
several
taste
or
ability
we
were
to
dine
here
and
after
a
time
fritz
and
jack
began
to
prepare
a
fireplace
their
great
ambition
being
to
heat
the
stones
red
hot
and
cook
the
crab
in
a
hollow
gourd
their
mother
therefore
left
them
to
their
own
devices
and
attended
to
the
hungry
animals
unharnessing
the
ass
to
graze
and
giving
cocoanut
milk
to
the
poor
little
monkey
who
had
been
obliged
to
travel
in
a
covered
basket
for
some
time
lest
he
should
be
lost
in
the
woods
the
wounded
bustard
had
been
completely
forgotten
and
from
heat
and
thirst
was
suffering
greatly
until
her
friendly
care
revived
it
and
it
was
tied
to
a
tree
and
allowed
to
move
about
its
fierce
spirit
greatly
tamed
by
adversity
the
cooking
operations
came
to
a
stand
soon
after
the
fire
was
lighted
for
it
appeared
that
we
had
no
more
water
in
the
jars
we
had
brought
so
the
boys
proposed
to
go
in
search
of
a
spring
i
agreed
to
accompany
them
ernest
also
wished
to
join
us
and
as
our
intention
was
to
examine
merely
the
surrounding
wood
i
saw
no
objection
to
leaving
their
mother
and
franz
for
a
short
time
very
soon
after
our
exploration
began
ernest
who
was
in
front
turned
with
a
face
of
terror
shouting
a
wild
boar
an
immense
wild
boar
father
do
come
quick
and
sure
enough
i
heard
a
loud
snorting
and
puffing
as
some
large
animal
passed
hastily
through
the
thick
underwood
beyond
us
after
him
lads
after
him
cried
i
hurrying
forward
call
the
dogs
stand
ready
to
fire
and
we
pressed
through
the
bushes
to
the
spot
where
ernest
had
seen
the
creature
the
ground
was
grubbed
up
and
some
potatoes
lay
about
showing
that
we
had
disturbed
him
at
his
meal
ernest
and
jack
were
more
disposed
to
gather
the
roots
than
to
follow
up
the
chase
fritz
and
i
alone
went
after
the
dogs
who
eagerly
pushed
on
and
by
the
sounds
we
heard
had
evidently
attacked
the
boar
at
no
great
distance
terrific
barking
snarling
and
grunting
guided
us
to
the
scene
of
action
and
we
beheld
our
mastiffs
one
on
each
side
of
a
large
pig
holding
on
by
the
great
ears
while
the
animal
on
seeing
us
appeared
rather
to
beseech
our
interference
than
to
propose
to
offer
a
desperate
resistance
in
a
moment
the
truth
became
apparent
the
captive
grunter
was
no
fierce
native
of
the
forest
but
our
own
sow
our
excitement
had
been
wound
to
so
high
a
pitch
that
the
discovery
was
quite
a
shock
and
we
felt
half
angry
with
the
creature
who
had
disappointed
us
then
the
absurdity
of
the
whole
thing
made
us
laugh
heartily
and
calling
off
the
dogs
the
old
lady
was
released
from
her
ignominious
position
our
laughter
resounding
through
the
wood
brought
ernest
and
jack
from
their
potatoes
to
see
what
was
going
on
much
use
you
two
would
have
been
suppose
we
had
required
help
cried
fritz
as
they
recognized
their
old
friend
ah
well
you
see
returned
jack
ernest
and
i
had
a
sort
of
a
kind
of
presentiment
that
this
was
going
to
be
the
old
sow
and
just
look
at
our
fine
potatoes
a
good
deal
of
joking
on
the
subject
ensued
but
was
interrupted
by
ernest
who
drew
our
attention
to
fruit
resembling
apples
on
the
surrounding
bushes
and
on
the
grass
beneath
them
the
sow
was
making
amends
for
the
fright
and
pain
she
had
endured
by
munching
and
crunching
this
fruit
at
a
great
rate
fritz
feared
that
it
might
be
the
poisonous
manchineel
against
which
i
once
warned
them
but
on
examining
it
i
was
induced
to
pronounce
a
more
favorable
opinion
and
we
collected
a
quantity
in
hopes
that
if
the
monkey
approved
of
it
as
well
as
the
old
sow
we
might
be
able
to
enjoy
a
feast
ourselves
all
this
time
not
a
drop
of
water
had
we
seen
and
our
own
thirst
increasing
we
felt
eager
to
procure
some
before
returning
to
our
resting
place
jack
preceded
us
and
we
made
our
way
toward
a
high
rock
which
rose
above
the
thickets
when
he
suddenly
startled
us
by
a
loud
cry
of
a
crocodile
father
father
a
crocodile
nonsense
boy
a
crocodile
of
all
things
in
this
dry
parched
forest
where
we
ca
get
so
much
as
a
mouthful
of
water
on
advancing
to
where
jack
stood
i
perceived
that
his
mistake
was
not
so
very
silly
after
all
for
i
beheld
an
iguana
one
of
the
largest
of
the
lizard
species
and
truly
a
fellow
i
was
glad
to
assure
jack
that
the
strange
creature
he
had
found
was
perfectly
harmless
and
that
its
flesh
being
esteemed
a
delicacy
it
would
be
a
valuable
prize
to
carry
back
with
us
in
another
moment
fritz
would
have
fired
but
arresting
his
hand
your
shot
i
said
would
probably
only
wound
the
animal
and
being
extremely
tenacious
of
life
it
would
certainly
escape
we
must
gain
possession
of
the
sleeping
beauty
by
a
gentler
method
you
are
not
going
to
kiss
it
are
you
father
asked
jack
with
a
grin
i
tried
to
rebuke
him
for
his
impertinence
but
failing
i
commenced
operations
i
first
attached
a
cord
and
to
a
stout
stick
and
holding
a
light
switch
in
my
other
hand
i
began
to
approach
the
creature
with
soft
slow
steps
while
the
boys
looked
on
with
the
utmost
curiosity
presently
i
began
very
softly
to
whistle
a
sweet
yet
very
lively
air
which
i
continued
more
and
more
distinctly
as
i
drew
near
the
lizard
until
awaking
it
seemed
to
listen
with
pleasure
raising
its
head
as
though
better
to
catch
the
sounds
or
to
discover
whence
they
came
when
near
enough
i
began
gently
to
stroke
and
tickle
him
with
the
wand
continuing
to
whistle
the
prettiest
tunes
i
could
think
of
and
the
lizard
gave
signs
of
pleasurable
contentment
stretching
his
limbs
and
moving
his
tail
in
token
of
enjoyment
suddenly
availing
myself
of
a
movement
of
his
head
i
cast
the
noose
over
it
drew
the
cord
tight
and
placing
my
foot
on
the
body
i
was
about
to
kill
it
by
piercing
the
nostril
almost
the
only
vulnerable
part
in
this
singular
reptile
when
jack
received
such
a
slap
from
its
tail
which
was
furiously
driving
in
all
directions
as
sent
him
rolling
over
like
a
ninepin
at
the
same
time
he
opened
his
jaws
when
the
boys
took
fright
at
the
row
of
sharp
teeth
and
thinking
that
the
sooner
he
was
dead
the
better
were
for
battering
him
with
sticks
but
i
assuring
them
my
method
would
kill
him
more
quickly
and
without
pain
thrust
my
rod
into
his
nostril
on
which
the
blood
flowed
and
the
lizard
soon
expired
the
boys
seemed
to
think
me
as
wonderful
a
person
as
a
snake
charmer
and
the
success
of
my
stratagem
as
well
as
of
the
means
by
which
the
lizard
was
slain
called
forth
great
admiration
since
they
had
never
heard
of
the
animal
nor
of
the
method
of
capturing
it
so
commonly
practiced
in
the
west
indies
now
came
the
question
of
how
we
were
to
carry
this
unwieldy
burden
i
had
a
great
dislike
to
killing
any
creature
and
leaving
it
useless
behind
me
so
without
more
ado
i
fairly
took
it
on
my
back
and
marched
off
with
it
as
we
came
toward
the
calabash
wood
we
could
hear
the
voices
of
the
deserted
mother
and
child
calling
us
in
anxious
tones
for
indeed
our
protracted
absence
alarmed
them
we
shouted
joyously
in
reply
and
our
appearance
as
we
issued
from
the
woods
afforded
them
welcome
relief
from
their
fears
although
the
dreadful
creature
on
my
back
startled
them
not
a
little
there
was
so
much
to
tell
so
much
to
be
seen
that
for
a
time
hunger
and
thirst
were
forgotten
and
no
one
thought
even
of
the
water
we
had
vainly
gone
in
search
of
until
master
knips
having
slyly
possessed
himself
of
some
of
our
apples
was
discovered
munching
away
and
enjoying
them
amazingly
which
instantly
gave
the
boys
a
strong
wish
to
eat
some
also
and
as
the
bustard
likewise
pecked
at
them
without
hesitation
i
felt
sure
there
could
be
no
danger
and
on
tasting
them
i
concluded
it
was
the
fruit
of
the
guava
a
west
indian
plant
which
we
were
delighted
to
have
although
refreshing
this
fruit
rather
sharpened
than
appeased
our
appetites
and
we
were
glad
to
eat
the
provisions
we
had
brought
from
home
without
waiting
to
cook
anything
as
we
had
originally
intended
it
was
in
fact
high
time
to
move
homeward
and
we
thought
it
best
not
to
encumber
ourselves
with
the
sledge
and
the
greater
part
of
its
load
but
to
leave
it
until
the
next
day
the
ass
was
laden
with
the
iguana
and
the
bustard
and
little
franz
tired
as
he
was
looked
in
vain
for
a
spare
seat
on
its
back
our
road
home
lay
through
a
majestic
forest
of
oak
trees
beneath
which
lay
numberless
acorns
some
of
which
we
gathered
as
we
went
along
and
at
length
before
night
closed
in
we
all
reached
falconhurst
in
safety
when
supper
was
ready
we
were
thankful
to
recruit
our
exhausted
strength
by
eating
heartily
of
a
piece
of
broiled
iguana
with
potatoes
and
roast
acorns
which
tasted
like
excellent
chestnuts
chapter
vii
at
falconhurst
again
bagging
a
buffalo
the
first
thing
to
be
done
on
the
following
day
was
to
return
to
the
calabash
wood
to
fetch
the
sledge
with
the
dishes
bowls
and
baskets
we
had
made
fritz
alone
accompanied
me
i
desired
the
other
boys
to
remain
with
their
mother
intending
to
explore
beyond
the
chain
of
rocky
hills
and
thinking
a
large
party
undesirable
on
the
occasion
passing
through
the
wood
of
evergreen
oaks
we
observed
our
sow
feasting
on
the
acorns
evidently
not
a
whit
the
worse
for
the
fright
we
had
given
her
the
previous
day
in
fact
she
appeared
more
friendly
disposed
toward
us
than
usual
possibly
considering
us
as
her
deliverers
from
the
jaws
of
the
savage
dogs
many
birds
tenanted
this
grove
and
were
undisturbed
by
our
movements
until
fritz
fired
and
shot
a
beautiful
and
a
couple
of
parroquets
one
a
brilliant
scarlet
the
other
green
and
gold
fritz
was
in
the
act
of
reloading
his
gun
when
an
unaccountable
noise
struck
our
ears
and
put
us
instantly
on
the
alert
because
it
appeared
like
the
dull
thumping
sound
of
a
muffled
drum
and
reminded
us
of
the
possible
presence
of
savages
with
the
greatest
caution
we
drew
nearer
the
sound
concealing
ourselves
among
the
low
bushes
and
thick
grass
and
creepers
until
we
reached
an
open
glade
where
standing
on
an
old
prostrate
log
was
a
beautiful
bird
about
the
size
of
a
cock
of
a
rich
chestnut
brown
color
finely
mottled
with
dark
brown
and
gray
on
the
shoulders
were
curious
tufts
of
velvet
black
feathers
glossed
with
green
he
was
ruffling
his
wings
erecting
his
tail
and
neck
feathers
strutting
and
wheeling
about
in
a
most
strange
and
stately
fashion
after
maneuvering
for
some
time
in
this
manner
greatly
to
the
edification
of
a
party
of
birds
resembling
him
but
without
any
ruff
who
assembled
round
the
stump
were
enjoying
his
performances
he
spread
out
his
tail
like
a
fan
stiffened
his
wings
and
began
to
strike
with
them
in
short
rapid
beats
faster
and
faster
until
a
rumbling
sound
like
very
distant
thunder
was
produced
and
the
whirring
wings
enveloped
him
as
in
a
cloud
this
was
the
drumming
noise
which
had
alarmed
us
increased
as
i
imagine
by
the
wing
strokes
falling
at
times
on
the
decayed
and
hollow
stump
on
which
the
curious
pantomime
was
acted
i
was
watching
it
with
the
utmost
interest
when
a
shot
from
behind
me
was
fired
and
in
a
moment
the
play
was
at
an
end
my
son
had
changed
the
pretty
comedy
into
a
sad
and
needless
tragedy
the
enthusiastic
drummer
fell
dead
from
his
perch
and
the
crowd
of
admiring
companions
fled
in
dismay
the
cruel
interruption
of
a
scene
so
rare
and
remarkable
annoyed
me
extremely
and
i
blamed
fritz
for
firing
without
my
leave
i
felt
sure
the
bird
was
the
ruffed
grouse
and
a
very
fine
specimen
we
placed
it
on
the
ass
which
was
patiently
awaiting
our
return
and
went
on
our
way
the
sledge
was
quite
safe
where
we
had
left
it
it
was
early
in
the
day
and
i
resolved
to
explore
as
i
had
intended
the
line
of
cliff
and
rocky
hills
which
at
more
or
less
distance
from
the
seashore
extended
the
whole
length
of
coast
known
or
visible
to
us
i
desired
to
discover
an
opening
if
any
existed
by
which
to
penetrate
the
interior
of
the
country
or
to
ascertain
positively
that
we
were
walled
in
and
isolated
on
this
portion
of
the
coast
leaving
calabash
wood
behind
us
we
advanced
over
ground
covered
with
manioc
potatoes
and
many
plants
unknown
to
us
pleasant
streamlets
watered
the
fruitful
soil
and
the
view
on
all
sides
was
open
and
agreeable
some
bushes
attracted
my
notice
loaded
with
small
white
berries
of
peculiar
appearance
like
wax
and
very
sticky
when
plucked
i
recognized
in
this
a
plant
called
by
botanists
myrica
cerifera
and
with
much
pleasure
explained
to
fritz
that
by
melting
and
straining
these
berries
we
might
easily
succeed
in
making
candles
and
afford
very
great
satisfaction
to
the
mother
who
did
not
at
all
approve
of
having
to
lay
her
work
aside
and
retire
to
rest
the
moment
the
sun
set
the
greenish
wax
to
be
obtained
would
be
more
brittle
than
beeswax
but
it
would
burn
very
fairly
and
diffuse
an
agreeable
perfume
having
the
ass
with
us
we
lost
no
time
in
gathering
berries
enough
to
fill
one
of
the
large
canvas
bags
he
carried
and
we
then
continued
our
route
very
soon
we
met
with
another
natural
curiosity
the
curious
appearance
of
which
surprised
us
much
this
was
the
abode
under
one
roof
of
a
whole
colony
of
birds
about
the
size
of
yellow
hammers
but
of
plain
brown
plumage
the
nests
were
built
in
a
mass
round
the
stem
and
among
the
branches
of
a
tree
standing
alone
and
a
kind
of
roof
formed
of
grass
straws
and
fibers
covered
them
all
and
sheltered
the
community
from
rain
and
the
heat
of
the
sun
there
were
numbers
of
openings
into
the
irregular
sides
of
the
group
of
dwellings
the
nests
resembling
different
apartments
in
a
house
common
to
all
twigs
and
small
branches
emerged
here
and
there
from
the
walls
and
served
as
perches
for
the
young
birds
and
and
posts
of
observation
for
all
the
general
appearance
of
the
establishment
reminded
us
of
a
huge
the
feathered
inhabitants
swarmed
in
and
out
by
thousands
and
we
saw
among
them
many
beautiful
little
parrots
who
seemed
in
many
instances
to
contest
possession
of
the
nest
of
the
lawful
owners
fritz
being
an
expert
climber
and
exceedingly
anxious
to
examine
the
nests
more
closely
ascended
the
tree
hoping
to
obtain
one
or
two
young
birds
if
any
were
hatched
he
put
his
hands
into
several
holes
which
were
empty
but
at
last
his
intended
theft
and
robbery
met
with
repulse
and
chastisement
he
little
expected
for
reaching
far
back
into
the
nest
his
finger
was
seized
and
sharply
bitten
by
a
very
strong
beak
so
that
with
a
cry
he
withdrew
his
hand
and
shook
it
vigorously
to
lessen
the
pain
recovering
from
the
surprise
he
again
and
more
resolutely
seized
the
unkind
bird
and
despite
its
shrieks
and
screams
drew
it
from
its
retreat
crammed
it
into
his
pocket
buttoned
up
his
coat
and
slid
quickly
to
the
ground
pursued
by
numbers
of
the
relations
who
darted
from
the
other
holes
and
flew
round
the
robber
screeching
and
pecking
at
him
in
a
rage
fritz
prize
was
not
one
of
the
real
owners
of
the
nests
which
were
those
of
the
sociable
grosbeak
but
a
very
pretty
small
green
parrot
with
which
he
was
greatly
pleased
and
which
he
at
once
determined
to
tame
and
teach
to
speak
for
the
present
it
was
carefully
remanded
to
prison
in
his
pocket
this
curious
colony
of
birds
afforded
us
matter
for
conversation
as
we
went
on
our
way
their
cheerful
sociable
habits
and
the
instinct
which
prompted
them
to
unite
in
labor
for
the
common
good
appearing
most
wonderful
to
us
examples
of
the
kind
however
said
i
are
numerous
in
various
classes
of
animals
beavers
for
instance
build
and
live
together
in
a
very
remarkable
way
among
insects
bees
wasps
and
ants
are
well
known
as
social
architects
in
like
manner
the
coral
insect
works
wonders
beneath
the
ocean
waves
by
force
of
perseverance
and
united
effort
i
have
often
watched
ants
at
work
said
fritz
it
it
most
amusing
to
see
how
they
carry
on
the
various
works
and
duties
of
their
commonwealth
have
you
ever
noticed
how
much
trouble
they
take
with
the
eggs
inquired
i
to
see
how
far
he
understood
the
process
carrying
them
about
in
the
warmth
of
the
sun
until
they
are
hatched
ah
that
is
rather
the
chrysalis
of
the
antworm
or
larva
which
is
produced
from
an
egg
i
know
they
are
called
ants
eggs
but
strictly
speaking
that
is
incorrect
you
are
perfectly
right
my
boy
well
if
you
have
taken
so
much
interest
in
watching
the
little
ants
of
your
native
country
how
delighted
and
astonished
you
would
be
to
see
the
wonders
performed
by
the
vast
tribes
of
large
ants
in
foreign
lands
some
of
these
build
heaps
or
nests
four
or
six
feet
high
and
proportionately
broad
which
are
so
strong
and
firm
that
they
defy
equally
sunshine
and
rain
they
are
within
divided
into
regular
streets
galleries
vaults
and
nurseries
so
firmly
are
these
mounds
built
that
with
interior
alterations
a
deserted
one
might
be
used
for
a
baking
oven
the
ant
although
respected
since
the
days
of
king
solomon
as
a
model
of
industry
is
not
in
itself
an
attractive
insect
it
exudes
a
sticky
moisture
its
smell
is
unpleasant
and
it
destroys
and
devours
whatever
eatable
comes
in
its
way
although
in
our
own
country
it
does
little
harm
the
large
ants
of
foreign
lands
are
most
destructive
and
troublesome
it
being
very
difficult
to
check
their
depredations
fortunately
they
have
enemies
by
whose
exertions
their
numbers
are
kept
down
birds
other
insects
and
even
beasts
prey
upon
them
chief
among
the
latter
is
the
or
tamanoir
of
south
america
a
large
creature
six
or
seven
feet
in
length
covered
with
long
coarse
hair
drooping
like
a
heavy
plume
over
the
hind
quarters
the
head
is
wonderfully
elongated
and
very
narrow
it
is
destitute
of
teeth
and
the
tongue
resembles
somewhat
a
great
red
it
has
immensely
strong
curved
claws
with
which
it
tears
and
breaks
down
and
scratches
to
pieces
the
hard
walls
of
the
then
protruding
its
sticky
tongue
it
coils
and
twists
it
about
among
the
terrified
millions
disturbed
by
its
attack
they
adhere
to
this
horrible
invader
and
are
drawn
irresistibly
backward
into
the
hungry
toothless
jaws
awaiting
them
the
little
is
not
more
than
about
inches
in
length
has
a
shorter
and
more
natural
looking
head
and
fine
silky
fur
it
usually
lives
in
trees
i
was
pleased
to
find
my
memory
served
me
so
well
on
this
subject
as
it
interested
my
boy
amazingly
and
occupied
us
for
a
considerable
time
while
we
traveled
onward
arriving
presently
at
a
grove
of
tall
trees
with
very
strong
broad
thick
leaves
we
paused
to
examine
them
they
bore
a
round
fruit
full
of
little
seeds
and
of
a
sour
harsh
taste
fritz
saw
some
gummy
resin
exuding
from
cracks
in
the
bark
and
it
reminded
him
of
the
boyish
delight
afforded
by
collecting
gum
from
at
home
so
that
he
must
needs
stop
to
scrape
off
as
much
as
he
could
he
rejoined
me
presently
attempting
to
soften
what
he
had
collected
in
his
hands
but
finding
it
would
not
work
like
gum
he
was
about
to
fling
it
away
when
he
suddenly
found
that
he
could
stretch
it
and
that
it
sprang
back
to
its
original
size
oh
father
only
look
this
gum
is
quite
elastic
can
it
possibly
be
what
cried
i
let
me
see
it
a
valuable
discovery
that
would
be
indeed
and
i
do
believe
you
are
perfectly
right
why
would
it
be
so
very
valuable
father
inquired
fritz
i
have
only
seen
it
used
for
rubbing
out
pencil
marks
i
replied
or
more
properly
caoutchouc
is
a
milky
resinous
juice
which
flows
from
certain
trees
in
considerable
quantities
when
the
stem
is
purposely
tapped
these
trees
are
indigenous
to
the
south
american
countries
of
brazil
guiana
and
cayenne
the
natives
who
first
obtained
it
used
to
form
bottles
by
smearing
earthen
flasks
with
repeated
coatings
of
the
gum
when
just
fresh
from
the
trees
and
when
hardened
and
sufficiently
thick
they
broke
the
mold
shook
out
the
fragments
and
hung
the
bottles
in
the
smoke
when
they
became
firmer
and
of
a
dark
color
while
moist
the
savages
were
in
the
habit
of
drawing
rude
figures
and
lines
on
the
resin
by
way
of
ornament
these
marks
you
may
have
observed
for
the
bottles
obtained
from
the
natives
by
the
spaniards
and
portuguese
have
for
years
been
brought
to
europe
and
cut
into
portions
to
be
sold
for
use
in
drawing
caoutchouc
can
be
put
to
many
uses
and
i
am
delighted
to
have
it
here
as
we
shall
i
hope
be
able
to
make
it
into
different
forms
first
and
foremost
i
shall
try
to
manufacture
boots
and
shoes
soon
after
making
this
discovery
we
reached
the
cocoanut
wood
and
saw
the
bay
extending
before
us
and
the
great
promontory
we
called
cape
disappointment
which
hitherto
had
always
bounded
our
excursions
in
passing
through
the
wood
i
remarked
a
smaller
sort
of
palm
which
among
its
grand
companions
i
had
not
previously
noticed
one
of
these
had
been
broken
by
the
wind
and
i
saw
that
the
pith
had
a
peculiar
mealy
appearance
and
i
felt
convinced
that
this
was
the
in
the
pith
i
saw
some
fat
worms
or
maggots
and
suddenly
recollected
that
i
had
heard
of
them
before
as
feeding
on
the
sago
and
that
in
the
west
indies
they
are
eaten
as
a
delicacy
i
felt
inclined
to
try
what
they
tasted
like
so
at
once
kindling
a
fire
and
placing
some
sprinkled
with
salt
on
a
little
wooden
spit
i
set
them
to
roast
very
soon
rich
fat
began
to
drop
from
them
and
they
smelt
so
temptingly
good
that
all
repugnance
to
the
idea
of
eating
worms
vanished
and
putting
one
like
a
pat
of
butter
on
a
baked
potato
i
boldly
swallowed
it
and
liked
it
so
much
that
several
others
followed
in
the
same
way
fritz
also
summoned
courage
to
partake
of
this
novel
food
which
was
a
savory
addition
to
our
dinner
of
baked
potatoes
being
once
more
ready
to
start
we
found
so
dense
a
thicket
in
the
direct
route
that
we
turned
aside
without
attempting
to
penetrate
it
and
made
our
way
toward
the
sugar
brake
near
cape
disappointment
this
we
could
not
pass
without
cutting
a
handsome
bundle
of
and
the
donkey
carried
that
in
addition
to
the
bag
of
wax
berries
in
time
we
reached
the
sledge
in
calabash
wood
the
ass
was
unloaded
everything
placed
on
the
sledge
and
our
patient
beast
began
calmly
and
readily
to
drag
the
burden
he
had
hitherto
borne
on
his
back
no
further
adventure
befell
us
and
we
arrived
in
the
evening
at
falconhurst
where
our
welcome
was
as
warm
as
usual
all
we
had
to
tell
listened
to
with
the
greatest
interest
all
we
had
to
show
most
eagerly
examined
the
pretty
green
parroquet
enchanting
the
boys
most
particularly
an
excellent
supper
was
ready
for
us
and
with
thankful
hearts
we
enjoyed
it
together
then
ascending
to
our
treecastle
and
drawing
up
the
ladder
after
us
we
betook
ourselves
to
the
repose
well
earned
and
greatly
needed
after
this
fatiguing
day
the
idea
of
seemed
to
have
taken
the
fancy
of
all
the
boys
and
next
morning
they
woke
one
after
the
other
with
the
word
candle
on
their
lips
when
they
were
thoroughly
roused
they
continued
to
talk
candles
all
candles
were
the
subject
of
conversation
and
after
breakfast
they
would
hear
of
nothing
else
but
setting
to
work
at
once
and
making
candles
so
be
it
said
i
let
us
become
chandlers
i
spoke
confidently
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
had
in
my
own
mind
certain
misgivings
as
to
the
result
of
our
experiment
in
the
first
place
i
knew
that
we
lacked
a
very
important
ingredient
animal
fat
which
is
necessary
to
make
candles
burn
for
any
length
of
time
with
brilliancy
besides
this
i
rather
doubted
how
far
my
memory
would
recall
the
various
operations
necessary
in
the
manufacture
of
all
this
however
i
said
nothing
and
the
boys
under
my
direction
were
soon
at
work
we
first
picked
off
the
berries
and
threw
them
into
a
large
shallow
iron
vessel
placed
on
the
fire
the
green
wax
was
rapidly
melted
rising
to
the
surface
of
the
juice
yielded
by
the
berries
this
we
skimmed
off
and
placed
in
a
separate
pot
by
the
fire
ready
for
use
repeating
the
operation
several
times
until
we
had
collected
sufficient
liquid
wax
for
our
purpose
i
then
took
the
wicks
my
wife
had
prepared
and
dipped
them
one
after
the
other
into
the
wax
handing
them
as
i
did
so
to
fritz
who
hung
them
up
on
a
bush
to
dry
the
coating
they
thus
obtained
was
not
very
thick
but
by
repeating
the
operation
several
times
they
at
length
assumed
very
fair
proportions
and
became
real
sturdy
candles
our
wax
being
at
an
end
we
hung
these
in
a
cool
shady
place
to
harden
and
that
same
night
we
sat
up
like
civilized
beings
three
whole
hours
after
sunset
and
falconhurst
was
for
the
first
time
brilliantly
illuminated
we
were
all
delighted
with
the
success
of
our
experiment
you
are
indeed
clever
said
my
wife
i
only
wish
that
with
your
ingenuity
you
would
show
me
how
to
make
butter
day
after
day
i
have
the
annoyance
of
seeing
a
large
supply
of
good
cream
go
bad
under
my
very
eyes
simply
because
i
have
no
use
to
which
to
put
it
invent
a
plan
please
do
i
think
that
perhaps
i
can
help
you
i
replied
after
a
little
consideration
not
that
i
can
claim
the
honor
of
the
invention
of
my
plan
that
is
due
to
the
hottentots
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
jack
bring
me
one
of
our
gourd
bottles
i
took
the
gourd
one
of
those
i
had
previously
prepared
with
a
small
hole
at
one
end
and
well
hollowed
out
and
cleaned
this
i
partially
filled
with
cream
and
then
corked
up
the
hole
tightly
here
boys
said
i
you
can
continue
the
operation
while
i
turn
carpenter
and
make
a
cart
to
take
the
place
of
our
sledge
i
gave
them
their
directions
and
then
set
about
my
own
work
they
fixed
four
posts
in
the
ground
and
to
them
fastened
a
square
piece
of
sailcloth
by
four
cords
attached
to
the
corners
in
this
cradle
they
placed
the
gourd
of
cream
and
each
taking
a
side
rolled
it
backward
and
forward
continuously
for
half
an
hour
now
i
cried
looking
up
from
my
work
open
the
gourd
and
take
the
contents
to
your
mother
with
my
compliments
they
did
so
and
my
good
wife
eyes
were
delighted
with
the
sight
of
a
large
lump
of
capital
fresh
butter
with
my
son
assistance
the
cart
was
in
time
completed
a
clumsy
vehicle
it
was
but
strong
enough
for
any
purpose
to
which
we
might
put
it
and
as
it
proved
of
immense
use
to
us
in
collecting
the
harvest
we
then
turned
our
attention
to
our
which
we
had
planted
in
a
plot
ready
for
transplanting
the
walnut
cherry
and
chestnut
trees
we
arranged
in
parallel
rows
so
as
to
form
a
shady
avenue
from
falconhurst
to
and
between
them
we
laid
down
a
tolerable
road
that
we
might
have
no
difficulty
in
reaching
tentholm
be
the
weather
bad
as
it
might
we
planted
the
vines
round
the
arched
roots
of
our
great
mangrove
and
the
rest
of
the
trees
in
suitable
spots
some
near
falconhurst
and
others
away
over
jackal
river
to
adorn
tentholm
tentholm
had
been
the
subject
of
serious
thoughts
to
me
for
some
time
past
and
i
now
turned
all
my
attention
thither
it
was
not
my
ambition
to
make
it
beautiful
but
to
form
of
it
a
safe
place
of
refuge
in
a
case
of
emergency
my
first
care
therefore
was
to
plant
a
thick
prickly
hedge
capable
of
protecting
us
from
any
wild
animal
and
forming
a
tolerable
obstacle
to
the
attack
of
even
savages
should
they
appear
not
satisfied
with
this
however
we
fortified
the
bridge
and
on
a
couple
of
hillocks
mounted
two
guns
which
we
brought
from
the
wreck
and
with
whose
angry
mouths
we
might
bark
defiance
at
any
enemy
man
or
beast
six
weeks
slipped
away
while
we
were
thus
busily
occupied
six
weeks
of
hard
yet
pleasant
labor
we
greeted
each
sunday
and
its
accompanying
rest
most
gratefully
and
on
that
day
always
especially
thanked
god
for
our
continued
health
and
safety
i
soon
saw
that
this
hard
work
was
developing
in
the
boys
remarkable
strength
and
this
i
encouraged
by
making
them
practice
running
leaping
climbing
and
swimming
i
also
saw
however
that
it
was
having
a
less
satisfactory
effect
upon
their
clothes
which
though
a
short
time
before
remarkably
neat
were
now
in
spite
of
the
busy
mother
mending
and
patching
most
untidy
and
disreputable
i
determined
therefore
to
pay
another
visit
to
the
wreck
to
replenish
our
wardrobe
and
to
see
how
much
longer
the
vessel
was
likely
to
hold
together
three
of
the
boys
and
i
went
off
in
the
pinnace
the
old
ship
seemed
in
much
the
same
condition
as
when
we
had
left
her
a
few
more
planks
had
gone
but
that
was
all
come
boys
cried
i
not
an
article
of
the
slightest
value
must
be
left
on
board
rummage
her
out
to
the
very
bottom
of
her
hold
they
took
me
at
my
word
sailors
chests
bales
of
cloth
and
linen
a
couple
of
small
guns
ball
and
shot
tables
benches
window
shutters
bolts
and
locks
barrels
of
pitch
all
were
soon
in
a
heap
on
the
deck
we
loaded
the
pinnace
and
went
on
shore
we
soon
returned
with
our
in
tow
and
after
a
few
more
trips
nothing
was
left
on
board
one
more
trip
said
i
to
my
wife
before
we
started
again
and
there
will
be
the
end
of
the
brave
ship
which
carried
us
from
switzerland
i
have
left
two
barrels
of
gunpowder
on
board
and
mean
to
blow
her
up
before
we
lighted
the
fusee
i
discovered
a
large
copper
caldron
which
i
thought
i
might
save
i
made
fast
to
it
a
couple
of
empty
casks
that
when
the
ship
went
up
it
might
float
the
barrels
were
laced
the
train
lighted
and
we
returned
on
shore
the
supper
was
laid
outside
the
tent
at
a
spot
from
whence
we
might
obtain
a
good
view
of
the
wreck
darkness
came
on
suddenly
a
vivid
pillar
of
fire
rose
from
the
black
waters
a
sullen
roar
boomed
across
the
sea
and
we
knew
that
our
good
old
ship
was
no
more
we
had
planned
the
destruction
of
the
vessel
we
knew
that
it
was
for
the
best
and
yet
that
night
we
went
to
bed
with
a
feeling
of
sadness
in
our
hearts
as
though
we
had
lost
a
dear
old
friend
next
morning
all
our
sadness
was
dispelled
and
it
was
with
pleasure
that
we
saw
the
shore
lined
with
a
rich
store
of
planks
and
beams
the
remnants
of
the
wreck
i
soon
found
too
the
copper
caldron
which
was
successfully
floated
by
the
casks
this
i
got
on
shore
and
hauling
it
up
among
the
rocks
stored
under
it
the
powder
casks
we
had
landed
the
day
before
collecting
all
these
valuables
gave
us
some
little
trouble
and
while
we
were
thus
engaged
my
wife
brought
us
good
news
she
had
discovered
that
two
ducks
and
a
goose
had
each
reared
a
large
family
among
the
reeds
by
the
river
and
they
presently
appeared
waddling
past
us
apparently
vastly
well
pleased
with
their
performance
we
greeted
them
joyfully
hurrah
cried
ernest
we
be
able
to
afford
duck
and
green
peas
some
day
soon
and
imagine
we
once
more
civilized
mortals
the
sight
of
these
birds
reminded
me
of
our
family
at
falconhurst
and
i
announced
my
intention
of
paying
them
a
visit
everyone
was
delighted
and
everyone
would
come
with
me
as
we
approached
falconhurst
i
noticed
that
several
young
trees
in
our
avenue
were
considerably
bent
by
the
wind
and
this
resolved
me
to
make
an
expedition
next
day
to
cut
bamboos
for
their
support
as
fritz
was
the
only
one
besides
myself
who
had
visited
cape
disappointment
and
the
surrounding
country
my
wife
and
the
younger
boys
begged
hard
to
be
allowed
to
accompany
me
i
consented
and
next
morning
we
started
bringing
with
us
the
cart
drawn
by
the
cow
and
ass
and
laden
with
everything
necessary
for
an
expedition
of
several
days
a
tent
provisions
a
large
supply
of
ammunition
and
all
sorts
of
implements
and
utensils
for
i
intended
to
make
a
great
collection
of
fruits
and
the
produce
of
different
trees
it
was
a
lovely
morning
and
passing
gayly
through
the
plantations
of
potatoes
manioc
and
cassavas
we
came
to
the
nests
of
the
sociable
grosbeak
the
sight
of
which
charmed
the
children
immensely
we
reached
the
wax
trees
and
there
i
called
a
halt
for
i
wished
to
gather
a
sack
or
two
of
the
berries
that
we
might
renew
our
stock
of
candles
the
berries
were
soon
plucked
and
i
stored
them
away
among
the
bushes
marking
the
spot
that
we
might
find
them
on
our
return
now
for
the
caoutchouc
tree
said
i
now
for
the
waterproof
boots
and
leggings
to
keep
your
feet
dry
ernest
to
the
caoutchouc
tree
we
directed
our
steps
and
were
soon
busily
engaged
in
stabbing
the
bark
and
placing
vessels
beneath
to
catch
the
sap
we
again
moved
forward
and
crossing
the
palm
wood
entered
upon
a
delightful
plain
bounded
on
one
side
by
an
extensive
field
of
waving
on
the
other
by
a
thicket
of
bamboos
and
lovely
palms
while
in
front
stretched
the
shining
sea
calm
and
noiseless
how
beautiful
exclaimed
jack
let
us
pitch
our
tent
here
and
stay
here
always
instead
of
living
at
falconhurst
it
would
be
jolly
very
likely
replied
i
and
so
would
be
the
attacks
of
wild
beasts
imagine
a
great
tiger
lying
in
wait
in
the
thicket
yonder
and
pouncing
out
on
us
at
night
no
no
thank
you
i
much
prefer
our
nest
in
the
tree
or
our
impregnable
position
at
tentholm
we
must
make
this
our
headquarters
for
the
present
however
for
though
perhaps
dangerous
it
is
the
most
convenient
spot
we
shall
find
call
a
halt
and
pitch
the
tent
our
beasts
were
quickly
unyoked
the
tent
arranged
a
large
fire
lit
supper
started
and
we
dispersed
in
various
directions
some
to
cut
bamboos
and
some
to
collect
we
then
returned
and
as
supper
was
still
not
ready
and
the
boys
were
hungry
they
decided
to
obtain
some
cocoanuts
this
time
however
no
assistance
was
to
be
had
from
either
monkeys
or
and
they
gazed
up
with
longing
eyes
at
the
fruit
above
them
we
can
climb
said
fritz
up
with
you
boys
jack
and
he
each
rushed
at
one
of
the
smooth
slippery
trunks
right
vigorously
they
struggled
upward
but
to
no
purpose
before
they
had
accomplished
of
the
distance
they
found
themselves
slipping
rapidly
to
the
ground
here
you
young
athletes
cried
i
i
foresaw
this
difficulty
and
have
provided
for
it
so
saying
i
held
up
buskins
of
shark
skin
which
i
had
previously
prepared
and
which
i
now
bound
on
to
their
legs
thus
equipped
they
again
attempted
the
ascent
and
with
a
loop
of
rope
passed
round
their
body
and
the
trunk
of
the
tree
quickly
reached
the
summit
my
wife
joined
me
and
together
we
watched
the
boys
as
they
ascended
tree
after
tree
throwing
down
the
best
fruit
from
each
they
then
returned
and
jestingly
begged
ernest
to
produce
the
result
of
his
labor
the
professor
had
been
lying
on
the
grass
gazing
at
the
palms
but
on
this
sarcastic
remark
he
sprang
to
his
feet
willingly
he
exclaimed
and
seizing
a
pair
of
buskins
he
quickly
donned
them
give
me
a
cocoanut
shell
said
he
i
gave
him
one
and
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
he
ran
to
a
tree
and
with
an
agility
which
surprised
us
all
quickly
reached
the
top
no
sooner
had
he
done
so
than
fritz
and
jack
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
he
had
swarmed
a
tree
which
bore
no
nuts
ernest
apparently
heard
them
for
as
it
seemed
in
a
fit
of
anger
he
drew
his
knife
and
severed
the
leafy
crest
which
fell
to
the
ground
i
glanced
up
at
him
surprised
at
such
a
display
of
temper
but
a
bright
smile
greeted
me
and
in
a
merry
tone
he
shouted
jack
pick
that
up
and
take
it
to
father
that
is
only
half
my
contribution
and
it
is
worth
all
your
nuts
put
together
he
spoke
truly
the
is
rare
and
the
tuft
of
leaves
at
its
summit
is
greatly
prized
by
the
south
americans
for
its
great
delicacy
and
highly
nutritive
qualities
bravo
i
cried
you
have
retrieved
your
character
come
down
and
receive
the
thanks
of
the
company
what
are
you
waiting
up
there
for
i
am
coming
presently
he
replied
with
the
second
half
of
my
contribution
i
hope
it
will
be
as
fully
appreciated
as
the
first
in
a
short
time
he
slipped
down
the
tree
and
advancing
to
his
mother
presented
her
with
the
he
had
taken
up
with
him
here
he
said
is
a
wine
which
the
greatest
connoisseur
would
prize
taste
it
mother
the
shell
was
filled
with
a
clear
rosy
liquor
bright
and
sparkling
my
wife
tasted
it
excellent
excellent
she
exclaimed
your
very
good
health
my
dear
boy
we
drank
the
rosy
wine
in
turn
and
ernest
received
hearty
thanks
from
all
it
was
getting
late
and
while
we
were
enjoying
our
supper
before
our
tent
our
donkey
who
had
been
quietly
browsing
near
us
suddenly
set
up
a
loud
bray
and
without
the
least
apparent
cause
pricked
up
his
ears
threw
up
his
heels
and
galloped
off
into
the
thicket
of
bamboos
we
followed
for
a
short
distance
and
i
sent
the
dogs
in
chase
but
they
returned
without
our
friend
and
as
it
was
late
we
were
obliged
to
abandon
the
chase
i
was
annoyed
by
this
incident
and
even
alarmed
for
not
only
had
we
lost
the
ass
but
i
knew
not
what
had
occasioned
his
sudden
flight
i
knew
not
whether
he
was
aware
by
instinct
of
the
approach
of
some
fierce
wild
beast
i
said
nothing
of
this
to
my
family
but
making
up
an
unusually
large
fire
i
bade
them
sleep
with
their
arms
by
their
sides
and
we
all
lay
down
a
bright
morning
awoke
us
early
and
i
rose
and
looked
out
thinking
that
perhaps
our
poor
donkey
might
have
been
attracted
by
the
light
of
the
fires
and
have
returned
alas
not
a
sign
of
him
was
to
be
seen
as
we
could
not
afford
to
lose
so
valuable
a
beast
i
determined
to
leave
no
attempt
untried
to
regain
him
we
hurriedly
breakfasted
and
as
i
required
the
dogs
to
assist
me
in
the
search
i
left
my
elder
sons
to
protect
their
mother
and
bade
jack
get
ready
for
a
day
march
this
arrangement
delighted
him
and
we
quickly
set
out
for
an
hour
or
more
we
trudged
onward
directed
by
the
print
of
the
ass
hoofs
sometimes
we
lost
the
track
for
a
while
and
then
again
discovered
it
as
we
reached
softer
soil
finally
this
guide
failed
us
altogether
for
the
donkey
seemed
to
have
joined
in
with
a
herd
of
some
larger
animals
with
whose
his
had
mingled
i
now
almost
turned
back
in
despair
but
jack
urged
me
to
continue
the
search
for
said
he
if
we
once
get
upon
a
hill
we
shall
see
such
a
large
herd
as
this
must
be
at
almost
any
distance
do
let
us
go
on
father
i
consented
and
we
again
pushed
forward
through
bushes
and
over
torrents
sometimes
cutting
our
way
with
an
ax
and
sometimes
plunging
through
a
swamp
we
at
length
reached
the
border
of
a
wide
plain
and
on
it
in
the
distance
i
could
see
a
herd
of
animals
browsing
on
the
rich
grass
it
struck
me
that
it
might
be
the
very
herd
to
which
our
good
donkey
had
joined
himself
and
wishing
to
ascertain
whether
this
was
so
i
resolved
to
make
a
detour
through
a
bamboo
marsh
and
get
as
near
as
possible
to
the
animals
without
disturbing
them
the
bamboos
were
huge
many
of
them
over
thirty
feet
in
height
and
as
we
made
our
way
through
them
i
remembered
an
account
of
the
giant
cane
of
south
america
which
is
greatly
prized
by
the
indians
on
account
of
its
extreme
usefulness
the
reeds
themselves
make
masts
for
their
canoes
while
each
joint
will
form
a
cask
or
box
i
was
delighted
for
i
had
little
doubt
that
the
bamboos
we
were
among
were
the
same
species
i
explained
this
to
jack
and
as
we
discussed
the
possibility
of
cutting
one
down
and
carrying
a
portion
of
it
home
we
reached
the
border
of
the
marsh
and
emerged
upon
the
plain
there
we
suddenly
found
ourselves
face
to
face
with
the
herd
which
we
sought
a
herd
of
buffaloes
they
looked
up
and
stared
at
us
inquisitively
but
without
moving
jack
would
have
fired
but
i
checked
him
back
to
the
thicket
i
said
and
keep
back
the
dogs
we
began
to
retreat
but
before
we
were
again
under
cover
the
dogs
joined
us
and
in
spite
of
our
shouts
and
efforts
to
restrain
them
they
dashed
forward
and
seized
a
buffalo
calf
this
was
a
signal
to
the
whole
herd
to
attack
us
they
bellowed
loudly
pawed
the
ground
and
tore
it
up
with
their
horns
and
then
dashed
madly
toward
us
we
had
not
time
to
step
behind
a
rock
before
the
leader
was
upon
us
so
close
was
he
that
my
gun
was
useless
i
drew
a
pistol
and
fired
he
fell
dead
at
my
feet
his
fall
checked
the
advance
of
the
rest
they
halted
snuffed
the
air
turned
tail
and
galloped
off
across
the
plain
they
were
gone
but
the
dogs
still
held
gallantly
to
the
calf
they
dragged
and
tussled
with
him
but
with
their
utmost
efforts
they
could
not
bring
him
to
the
ground
how
to
assist
them
without
shooting
the
poor
beast
i
knew
not
and
this
i
was
unwilling
to
do
for
i
hoped
that
if
we
could
but
capture
him
alive
we
might
in
time
manage
to
tame
him
and
use
him
as
a
beast
of
burden
jack
clever
little
head
however
suddenly
devised
a
plan
for
their
aid
and
with
his
usual
promptitude
he
at
once
put
it
into
execution
he
unwound
the
lasso
which
was
coiled
round
his
body
and
as
the
young
bull
flung
up
his
heels
he
cast
it
and
caught
him
by
his
hind
legs
the
noose
drew
tight
and
in
a
twinkling
the
beast
was
upon
the
ground
we
fastened
the
other
end
of
the
cord
round
a
stout
bamboo
called
off
the
dogs
and
the
animal
was
at
our
mercy
now
we
have
got
him
said
jack
as
he
looked
at
the
poor
beast
lying
panting
on
the
ground
what
are
we
to
do
with
him
i
will
show
you
said
i
help
me
to
fasten
his
together
and
you
shall
see
the
next
operation
the
bull
thus
secured
could
not
move
and
while
jack
held
his
head
i
drew
my
knife
and
pierced
the
cartilage
of
his
nose
and
when
the
blood
flowed
less
freely
passed
a
stout
cord
through
the
hole
i
felt
some
repugnance
at
thus
paining
the
animal
but
it
was
a
case
of
necessity
and
i
could
not
hesitate
we
united
the
ends
of
the
cord
freed
the
animal
set
him
upon
his
legs
and
subdued
and
overawed
he
followed
us
without
resistance
i
now
turned
my
attention
to
the
dead
buffalo
but
as
i
could
not
then
skin
it
i
contented
myself
with
cutting
off
the
most
delicate
parts
its
tongue
and
a
couple
of
steaks
and
packing
them
in
salt
in
my
wallet
abandoned
the
rest
to
the
dogs
they
fell
upon
it
greedily
and
we
retired
under
the
shade
to
enjoy
a
meal
after
our
hard
work
the
dogs
however
were
not
to
have
undisputed
possession
of
the
carcass
vultures
crows
and
other
birds
of
prey
with
that
marvelous
instinct
which
always
leads
them
to
a
dead
body
quickly
filled
the
air
and
with
discordant
cries
swooped
down
upon
the
buffalo
an
amusing
contest
ensued
the
dogs
again
and
again
drove
off
the
intruders
and
they
as
often
returned
by
others
who
swarmed
to
the
spot
jack
with
his
usual
impetuosity
wished
to
send
a
shot
in
among
the
robber
band
but
i
prevented
him
for
i
knew
that
the
bird
or
two
he
might
kill
would
be
of
no
use
to
us
while
his
shot
would
not
drive
away
the
rest
even
had
we
wished
it
both
we
and
the
dogs
were
at
length
satisfied
and
as
it
was
getting
late
i
determined
to
give
up
for
the
present
the
search
for
the
ass
and
to
return
to
our
camp
we
again
made
our
way
through
the
bamboos
but
before
we
left
the
thicket
i
cut
down
one
of
the
smallest
of
the
reeds
the
largest
of
whose
joints
would
form
capital
little
barrels
while
those
near
the
tapering
top
would
serve
as
molds
for
our
next
batch
of
candles
the
buffalo
with
a
dog
on
either
side
and
the
rope
through
his
nose
was
following
us
passively
and
we
presently
induced
him
to
submit
to
a
package
of
our
goods
laid
upon
his
back
we
pushed
rapidly
forward
jack
eager
to
display
our
latest
acquisition
as
we
repassed
the
rocky
bed
of
a
stream
we
had
crossed
in
the
morning
juno
dashed
ahead
and
was
about
to
rush
into
a
cleft
between
the
rocks
when
the
appearance
of
a
large
jackal
suddenly
checked
her
further
progress
both
dogs
instantly
flew
at
the
animal
and
though
she
fought
desperately
quickly
overpowered
and
throttled
her
from
the
way
the
beast
had
shown
fight
i
concluded
that
her
young
must
be
close
by
probably
within
the
very
cleft
juno
was
about
to
enter
directly
jack
heard
this
he
wished
to
creep
in
and
bring
out
the
young
jackals
i
hesitated
to
allow
him
to
do
so
for
i
thought
it
possible
that
the
male
jackal
might
be
still
lying
in
wait
within
the
cave
we
peered
into
the
darkness
and
after
a
while
jack
declared
he
could
discern
the
little
yellow
jackals
and
that
he
was
quite
sure
the
old
one
was
not
there
he
then
crept
in
followed
closely
by
the
dogs
and
presently
emerged
bearing
in
his
arms
a
handsome
cub
of
a
beautiful
golden
yellow
and
about
the
size
of
a
small
cat
he
was
the
only
one
of
the
brood
he
had
managed
to
save
for
turk
and
juno
without
pity
for
their
youth
or
beauty
had
worried
all
the
rest
i
did
not
much
regret
this
however
for
i
firmly
believe
that
had
he
saved
them
jack
would
have
insisted
upon
bringing
up
the
whole
litter
as
it
was
i
considered
that
one
jackal
was
with
our
young
bull
quite
sufficient
an
addition
to
our
livestock
during
the
halt
we
had
made
i
had
fastened
the
buffalo
to
a
small
tree
and
as
i
was
now
again
about
to
move
on
i
recognized
it
as
the
whose
long
sharp
leaves
form
an
excellent
barrier
if
it
is
planted
as
a
hedge
i
determined
to
return
and
get
some
young
plants
to
strengthen
our
hedge
at
tentholm
it
was
late
before
we
reached
our
camp
where
we
found
our
family
anxiously
awaiting
our
return
the
sight
of
the
new
animals
delighted
the
children
immensely
and
in
their
opinion
amply
compensated
for
the
loss
of
our
poor
donkey
jack
had
to
answer
a
host
of
questions
concerning
their
capture
and
to
give
a
minute
account
of
the
affray
with
the
buffaloes
this
he
did
with
graphic
power
certainly
but
with
so
much
boasting
and
that
i
was
obliged
to
check
him
and
give
a
plain
and
unvarnished
account
of
the
affair
suppertime
arrived
and
as
we
sat
at
that
meal
for
which
jack
and
i
were
heartily
thankful
my
wife
and
her
party
proceeded
to
give
an
account
of
their
day
work
ernest
had
discovered
a
and
had
after
much
labor
contrived
to
fell
it
franz
and
his
mother
had
collected
dry
wood
of
which
a
huge
heap
now
stood
before
the
tent
sufficient
to
keep
up
a
fire
all
the
rest
of
the
time
we
should
stay
on
the
spot
fritz
had
gone
off
shooting
and
had
secured
a
good
bag
while
they
had
been
thus
variously
employed
a
troop
of
apes
had
visited
the
tent
and
when
they
returned
they
found
the
place
ransacked
and
turned
upside
down
the
provisions
were
eaten
and
gnawed
the
potatoes
thrown
about
the
milk
drunk
and
spilt
every
box
had
been
peeped
into
every
pot
and
pan
had
been
divested
of
its
lid
the
palisade
round
the
hut
had
been
partly
destroyed
nothing
had
been
left
untouched
industriously
had
the
boys
worked
to
repair
the
damage
and
when
we
returned
not
a
sign
was
to
be
seen
of
the
disorder
no
one
would
have
guessed
what
had
occurred
from
the
delicious
supper
we
were
eating
after
matters
had
been
again
arranged
fritz
had
gone
down
to
the
shore
and
among
the
rocks
at
cape
disappointment
had
discovered
a
young
eaglet
which
ernest
declared
to
be
a
malabar
or
indian
eagle
he
was
much
pleased
with
his
discovery
and
i
recommended
him
to
bring
the
bird
up
and
try
to
train
it
to
hunt
as
a
falcon
look
here
though
boys
said
i
you
are
now
collecting
a
good
many
pets
and
i
am
not
going
to
have
your
mother
troubled
with
the
care
of
them
all
each
must
look
after
his
own
and
if
i
find
one
neglected
whether
beast
or
bird
i
set
it
at
liberty
mark
that
and
remember
it
my
wife
looked
greatly
relieved
at
this
announcement
and
the
boys
promised
to
obey
my
directions
before
we
retired
for
the
night
i
prepared
the
buffalo
meat
i
had
brought
i
lit
a
large
fire
of
green
wood
and
in
the
smoke
of
this
thoroughly
dried
both
the
tongue
and
steaks
we
then
properly
secured
all
the
animals
jack
took
his
little
pet
in
his
arms
and
we
lay
down
and
were
soon
fast
asleep
at
daybreak
we
were
on
foot
and
began
to
prepare
for
a
return
to
falconhurst
you
are
not
going
to
despise
my
sago
i
hope
said
ernest
you
have
no
idea
what
a
trouble
it
was
to
cut
it
down
and
i
have
been
thinking
too
that
if
we
could
but
split
the
tree
we
might
make
a
couple
of
long
useful
troughs
which
might
i
think
be
made
to
carry
water
from
jackal
river
to
tentholm
is
my
plan
worth
consideration
indeed
it
is
i
replied
and
at
all
events
we
must
not
abandon
such
a
valuable
prize
as
a
i
would
put
off
our
departure
for
a
day
rather
than
leave
it
behind
we
went
to
the
palm
and
with
the
tools
we
had
with
us
attempted
to
split
the
trunk
we
first
sawed
off
the
upper
end
and
then
with
an
ax
and
saw
managed
to
insert
a
wedge
this
accomplished
our
task
was
less
difficult
for
with
a
heavy
mallet
we
forced
the
wedge
in
further
and
further
until
at
length
the
trunk
was
split
in
twain
from
one
half
of
the
trunk
we
then
removed
the
pith
disengaging
it
with
difficulty
from
the
tough
wood
fibers
at
each
end
however
i
left
a
portion
of
the
pith
untouched
thus
forming
a
trough
in
which
to
work
the
sago
now
boys
said
i
when
we
had
removed
the
pith
from
the
other
half
of
the
trunk
off
with
your
coats
and
turn
up
your
i
am
going
to
teach
you
to
knead
they
were
all
delighted
and
even
little
franz
begged
to
be
allowed
to
help
ernest
brought
a
couple
of
pitchers
of
water
and
throwing
it
in
amongst
the
pith
we
set
to
work
right
heartily
as
the
dough
was
formed
and
properly
kneaded
i
handed
it
to
the
mother
who
spread
it
out
on
a
cloth
in
the
sun
to
dry
this
new
occupation
kept
us
busy
until
the
evening
and
when
it
was
at
length
completed
we
loaded
the
cart
with
the
sago
a
store
of
cocoanuts
and
our
other
possessions
that
we
might
be
ready
to
start
early
on
the
following
morning
as
the
sun
rose
above
the
horizon
we
packed
up
our
tent
and
set
forth
a
goodly
caravan
i
thought
it
unfair
to
the
cow
to
make
her
drag
such
a
load
as
we
now
had
alone
and
determined
if
possible
to
make
the
young
buffalo
take
the
place
of
our
lost
donkey
after
some
persuasion
he
consented
and
soon
put
his
strength
to
the
work
and
brought
the
cart
along
famously
as
we
had
the
trough
slung
under
the
cart
we
had
to
choose
the
clearest
possible
route
avoiding
anything
like
a
thicket
we
therefore
could
not
pass
directly
by
the
candleberry
and
caoutchouc
trees
and
i
sent
ernest
and
jack
aside
to
visit
the
store
we
had
made
on
our
outward
journey
they
had
not
long
been
gone
when
i
was
alarmed
by
a
most
terrible
noise
accompanied
by
the
furious
barking
of
the
dogs
and
shouts
from
jack
and
ernest
thinking
that
the
boys
had
been
attacked
by
some
wild
beasts
i
ran
to
their
assistance
a
most
ludicrous
scene
awaited
me
when
i
reached
the
spot
they
were
dancing
and
shouting
round
and
round
a
grassy
glade
and
i
as
nearly
as
possible
followed
their
example
for
in
the
center
surrounded
by
a
promising
litter
lay
our
old
sow
whose
squeals
previously
so
alarming
were
now
subsiding
into
comfortable
grunts
of
recognition
i
did
not
join
my
boys
in
their
triumphal
dance
but
i
was
nevertheless
very
much
pleased
at
the
sight
of
the
flourishing
family
and
immediately
returned
to
the
cart
to
obtain
biscuits
and
potatoes
for
the
benefit
of
the
happy
mother
jack
and
ernest
meanwhile
pushed
further
on
and
brought
back
the
sack
of
candleberries
and
the
caoutchouc
and
as
we
could
not
then
take
the
sow
with
us
we
left
her
alone
with
her
family
and
proceeded
to
falconhurst
the
animals
were
delighted
to
see
us
back
again
and
received
us
with
manifestations
of
joy
but
looked
askance
at
the
new
pets
the
eagle
especially
came
in
for
shy
glances
and
promised
to
be
no
favorite
fritz
however
determined
that
his
pet
should
at
present
do
no
harm
secured
him
by
the
leg
to
a
root
of
a
fig
tree
and
uncovered
his
eyes
in
a
moment
the
aspect
of
the
bird
was
changed
with
his
sight
returned
all
his
savage
instincts
he
flapped
his
wings
raised
his
head
darted
to
the
full
length
of
his
chain
and
before
anyone
could
prevent
him
seized
the
unfortunate
parrot
which
stood
near
and
tore
it
to
pieces
fritz
anger
rose
at
the
sight
and
he
was
about
to
put
an
end
to
the
savage
bird
stop
said
ernest
do
kill
the
poor
creature
he
is
but
following
his
natural
instincts
give
him
to
me
and
i
will
tame
him
fritz
hesitated
no
no
he
said
i
do
want
really
to
kill
the
bird
but
i
ca
give
him
up
tell
me
how
to
tame
him
and
you
shall
have
master
knips
very
well
replied
ernest
i
will
tell
you
my
plan
and
if
it
succeeds
i
will
accept
knips
as
a
mark
of
your
gratitude
take
a
pipe
and
tobacco
and
send
the
smoke
all
around
his
head
so
that
he
must
inhale
it
by
degrees
he
will
become
stupefied
and
his
savage
nature
from
that
moment
subdued
fritz
was
rather
inclined
to
ridicule
the
plan
but
knowing
that
ernest
generally
had
a
good
reason
for
anything
of
the
sort
that
he
proposed
he
consented
to
make
the
attempt
he
soon
seated
himself
beneath
the
bird
who
still
struggled
furiously
and
puffed
cloud
after
cloud
upward
and
as
each
cloud
circled
round
the
eagle
head
he
became
quieter
and
quieter
until
he
sat
quite
still
gazing
stupidly
at
the
young
smoker
capital
cried
fritz
as
he
hooded
the
bird

chapter
viii
improving
our
tree
dwelling
next
morning
the
boys
and
i
started
with
the
cart
laden
with
our
bundles
of
bamboos
to
attend
to
the
avenue
of
fruit
trees
the
buffalo
we
left
behind
for
his
services
were
not
needed
and
i
wished
the
wound
in
his
nostrils
to
become
completely
cicatrized
before
i
again
put
him
to
work
we
were
not
a
moment
too
soon
many
of
the
young
trees
which
before
threatened
to
fall
had
now
fulfilled
their
promise
and
were
lying
prostrate
on
the
ground
others
were
bent
some
few
only
remained
erect
we
raised
the
trees
and
digging
deeply
at
their
roots
drove
in
stout
bamboo
props
to
which
we
lashed
them
firmly
with
strong
broad
fibers
papa
said
franz
as
we
were
thus
engaged
and
he
handed
me
the
fibers
as
i
required
them
are
these
wild
or
tame
trees
oh
these
are
wild
trees
most
ferocious
trees
laughed
jack
and
we
are
tying
them
up
lest
they
should
run
away
and
in
a
little
while
we
will
untie
them
and
they
will
trot
about
after
us
and
give
us
fruit
wherever
we
go
oh
we
will
tame
them
they
shall
have
a
ring
through
their
noses
like
the
buffalo
that
not
true
replied
franz
gravely
but
there
are
wild
and
tame
trees
the
wild
ones
grow
out
in
the
woods
like
the
and
the
tame
ones
in
the
garden
like
the
pears
and
peaches
at
home
which
are
these
papa
they
are
not
wild
i
replied
but
grafted
or
cultivated
or
as
you
call
them
tame
trees
no
european
tree
bears
good
fruit
until
it
is
grafted
i
saw
a
puzzled
look
come
over
the
little
boy
face
as
he
heard
this
new
word
and
i
hastened
to
explain
it
grafting
i
continued
is
the
process
of
inserting
a
slip
or
twig
of
a
tree
into
what
is
called
an
eye
that
is
a
knot
or
hole
in
the
branch
of
another
this
twig
or
slip
then
grows
and
produces
not
such
fruit
as
the
original
stock
would
have
borne
but
such
as
the
tree
from
which
it
was
taken
would
have
produced
thus
if
we
have
a
sour
crab
tree
and
an
apple
tree
bearing
fine
ribston
pippins
we
would
take
a
slip
of
the
latter
insert
it
in
an
eye
of
the
former
and
in
a
year
or
two
the
branch
which
would
then
grow
would
be
laden
with
good
apples
but
asked
ernest
where
did
the
slips
of
good
fruit
trees
come
from
if
none
grow
without
grafting
from
foreign
countries
i
replied
it
is
only
in
the
cold
climate
of
our
parts
of
the
world
that
they
require
this
grafting
in
many
parts
of
the
world
in
more
southern
latitudes
than
ours
the
most
luscious
fruit
trees
are
indigenous
to
the
soil
and
flourish
and
bear
sweet
wholesome
fruit
without
the
slightest
care
or
attention
being
bestowed
upon
them
while
in
england
and
germany
and
even
in
france
these
same
trees
require
the
utmost
exertion
of
horticultural
skill
to
make
them
bring
forth
any
fruit
whatever
thus
when
the
romans
invaded
england
they
found
there
nothing
in
the
way
of
fruit
trees
but
the
nut
bushes
and
bramble
bushes
but
by
grafting
on
these
fine
apples
filberts
and
raspberries
were
produced
and
it
was
the
same
in
our
own
dear
switzerland
all
our
fruit
trees
were
imported
were
cherries
father
may
we
not
even
call
cherries
swiss
i
always
thought
they
grew
nowhere
else
i
am
afraid
we
can
not
even
claim
cherries
as
our
own
not
even
the
name
of
them
they
are
called
cherries
from
cerasus
a
state
of
pontus
in
asia
whence
they
were
brought
to
europe
by
lucullus
a
roman
general
about
seventy
years
before
christ
hazelnuts
also
came
from
pontus
walnuts
again
came
originally
from
persia
as
for
grapes
they
are
of
the
greatest
antiquity
we
hear
if
you
remember
of
noah
cultivating
vines
and
they
have
been
brought
from
one
place
to
another
until
they
now
are
to
be
found
in
most
parts
of
the
civilized
world
do
you
think
all
these
trees
will
grow
asked
fritz
as
we
crossed
jackal
river
and
entered
our
plantation
at
tentholm
here
are
lemons
pomegranates
pistachio
nuts
and
mulberries
i
have
little
doubt
of
it
i
replied
we
are
evidently
within
the
tropics
where
such
trees
as
these
are
sure
to
flourish
these
pines
now
come
from
france
spain
and
italy
the
olives
from
armenia
and
palestine
the
figs
originally
from
the
island
of
chios
the
peaches
and
apricots
from
persia
plums
from
damascus
in
syria
and
the
pears
of
all
sorts
from
greece
however
if
our
countries
have
not
been
blessed
in
the
same
way
with
fruit
we
have
been
given
wisdom
and
skill
which
has
enabled
us
to
import
and
cultivate
the
trees
of
other
lands
we
thus
talked
and
worked
until
every
tree
that
required
the
treatment
was
provided
with
a
stout
bamboo
prop
and
then
with
appetites
which
a
gourmand
might
well
have
envied
we
returned
to
falconhurst
i
think
the
good
mother
was
almost
alarmed
at
the
way
we
fell
upon
the
corned
beef
and
she
set
before
us
but
at
length
these
good
things
produced
the
desired
effect
and
one
after
another
declared
himself
satisfied
as
we
sat
reclining
after
our
labor
and
digesting
our
dinner
we
discussed
the
various
projects
we
had
in
contemplation
i
wish
said
my
wife
that
you
would
invent
some
other
plan
for
climbing
to
the
nest
above
us
i
think
that
the
nest
itself
is
perfect
i
really
wish
for
nothing
better
but
i
should
like
to
be
able
to
get
to
it
without
scaling
that
dreadful
ladder
every
time
could
you
not
make
a
flight
of
steps
to
reach
it
i
carefully
thought
over
the
project
and
turned
over
every
plan
for
its
accomplishment
it
would
be
impossible
i
am
afraid
said
i
to
make
stairs
outside
but
within
the
trunk
it
might
be
done
more
than
once
have
i
thought
that
this
trunk
might
be
hollow
or
partly
so
and
if
such
be
the
case
our
task
would
be
comparatively
easy
did
you
not
tell
me
the
other
day
that
you
noticed
bees
coming
from
a
hole
in
the
tree
oh
yes
said
little
franz
and
i
went
to
look
at
them
and
one
flew
right
against
my
face
and
stung
me
and
i
almost
cried
but
i
did
brave
little
boy
said
i
well
now
if
the
trunk
be
sufficiently
hollow
to
contain
a
swarm
of
bees
it
may
be
for
all
we
can
tell
hollow
the
greater
part
of
its
length
for
like
the
willow
in
our
own
country
it
might
draw
all
its
nourishment
through
the
bark
and
in
spite
of
its
real
unsoundness
retain
a
flourishing
appearance
master
jack
practical
as
usual
instantly
sprang
to
his
feet
to
put
my
conjecture
to
the
proof
the
rest
followed
his
example
and
they
were
all
soon
climbing
about
like
squirrels
peeping
into
the
hole
and
tapping
the
wood
to
discover
by
sound
how
far
down
the
cavity
extended
they
forgot
in
their
eagerness
who
were
the
tenants
of
this
interesting
trunk
they
were
soon
reminded
of
it
however
for
the
bees
disturbed
by
this
unusual
noise
with
an
angry
buzz
burst
out
and
in
an
instant
attacked
the
causers
of
the
annoyance
they
swarmed
round
them
stung
them
on
the
hands
face
and
neck
settled
in
their
hair
and
pursued
them
as
they
ran
to
me
for
assistance
it
was
with
difficulty
that
we
got
rid
of
the
angry
insects
and
were
able
to
attend
to
the
boys
jack
who
had
been
the
first
to
reach
the
hole
had
fared
the
worst
and
was
soon
a
most
pitiable
sight
his
face
swelled
to
an
extraordinary
degree
and
it
was
only
by
the
constant
application
of
cold
earth
that
the
pain
was
alleviated
they
were
all
eager
to
commence
an
organized
attack
upon
the
bees
at
once
but
for
an
hour
or
more
by
reason
of
their
pain
they
were
unable
to
render
me
much
assistance
in
the
meanwhile
i
made
my
arrangements
i
first
took
a
large
calabash
gourd
for
i
intended
to
make
a
beehive
that
when
we
had
driven
the
insects
from
their
present
abode
we
might
not
lose
them
entirely
the
lower
half
of
the
gourd
i
flattened
i
then
cut
an
arched
opening
in
the
front
for
a
doorway
made
a
straw
roof
as
a
protection
from
the
rain
and
heat
and
the
little
house
was
complete
nothing
more
however
could
then
be
done
for
the
irritated
bees
were
still
angrily
buzzing
round
the
tree
i
waited
till
dark
and
then
when
all
the
bees
had
again
returned
to
their
trunk
with
fritz
assistance
i
carefully
stopped
up
every
hole
in
the
tree
with
wet
clay
that
the
bees
might
not
issue
forth
next
morning
before
we
could
begin
operations
very
early
were
we
up
and
at
work
i
first
took
a
hollow
cane
and
inserted
one
end
through
the
clay
into
the
tree
down
this
tube
with
pipe
and
tobacco
i
smoked
most
furiously
the
humming
and
buzzing
that
went
on
within
was
tremendous
the
bees
evidently
could
not
understand
what
was
going
to
happen
i
finished
my
first
pipeful
and
putting
my
thumb
over
the
end
of
the
cane
i
gave
the
pipe
to
fritz
to
refill
he
did
so
and
i
again
smoked
the
buzzing
was
now
becoming
less
noisy
and
was
subsiding
into
a
mere
murmur
by
the
time
i
had
finished
this
second
pipe
all
was
still
the
bees
were
stupefied
now
then
fritz
said
i
quick
with
a
hammer
and
chisel
and
stand
here
beside
me
he
was
up
in
a
moment
and
together
we
cut
a
small
door
by
the
side
of
the
hole
this
door
however
we
did
not
take
out
but
we
left
it
attached
by
one
corner
that
it
might
be
removed
at
a
moment
notice
then
giving
the
bees
a
final
dose
of
tobacco
smoke
we
opened
it
carefully
but
rapidly
we
removed
the
insects
as
they
clung
in
clusters
to
the
sides
of
the
tree
and
placed
them
in
the
hive
prepared
for
their
reception
as
rapidly
i
then
took
every
atom
of
wax
and
honey
from
their
storehouse
and
put
it
in
a
cask
i
had
made
ready
for
the
purpose
the
bees
were
now
safely
removed
from
the
trunk
but
i
could
not
tell
whether
when
they
revived
from
their
temporary
stupor
they
might
not
refuse
to
occupy
the
house
with
which
i
had
presented
them
and
insist
on
returning
to
their
old
quarters
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
this
occurrence
i
took
a
quantity
of
tobacco
and
placing
it
upon
a
board
nailed
horizontally
within
the
trunk
i
lighted
it
and
allowed
it
to
burn
slowly
that
the
fumes
might
fill
the
cavity
it
was
well
i
did
so
for
as
the
bees
returned
to
consciousness
they
left
their
pretty
hive
and
buzzed
away
to
the
trunk
of
the
tree
they
seemed
astonished
at
finding
this
uninhabitable
and
an
immense
deal
of
noisy
humming
ensued
round
and
round
they
flew
backward
and
forward
between
the
gourd
and
tree
now
settling
here
and
now
there
until
at
length
after
due
consideration
they
took
possession
of
the
hive
and
abandoned
their
former
habitation
to
us
the
invaders
of
their
territory
by
the
evening
they
were
quite
quiet
and
we
ventured
to
open
the
cask
in
which
we
had
stored
our
plunder
we
first
separated
the
honey
from
the
honeycomb
and
poured
it
off
into
jars
and
pots
the
rest
we
then
took
and
threw
into
a
vessel
of
water
placed
over
a
slow
fire
it
soon
boiled
and
the
entire
mass
became
fluid
this
we
placed
in
a
clean
canvas
bag
and
subjected
to
a
heavy
pressure
the
honey
was
thus
soon
forced
out
and
we
stored
it
in
a
cask
and
though
not
perhaps
quite
equal
to
the
former
batch
in
quality
it
was
yet
capital
the
wax
that
remained
in
the
bag
i
also
carefully
stored
for
i
knew
it
would
be
of
great
use
to
me
in
the
manufacture
of
candles
then
after
a
hard
day
work
we
turned
in
the
internal
architecture
of
the
tree
had
now
to
be
attended
to
and
early
the
following
morning
we
prepared
for
the
laborious
task
a
door
had
first
to
be
made
so
at
the
base
of
the
trunk
we
cut
away
the
bark
and
formed
an
opening
just
the
size
of
the
door
we
had
brought
from
the
captain
cabin
and
which
hinges
and
all
was
ready
to
be
hung
the
clearing
of
the
rotten
wood
from
the
center
of
the
trunk
occupied
us
some
time
but
at
length
we
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
it
entirely
accomplished
and
as
we
stood
below
we
could
look
up
the
trunk
which
was
like
a
great
smooth
funnel
and
see
the
sky
above
it
was
now
ready
for
the
staircase
and
first
we
erected
in
the
center
a
stout
sapling
to
form
an
axis
round
which
to
build
the
spiral
in
this
we
cut
notches
to
receive
the
steps
and
corresponding
notches
in
the
tree
itself
to
support
the
outer
ends
the
steps
themselves
we
formed
carefully
and
neatly
of
planks
from
the
wreck
and
clenched
them
firmly
in
their
places
with
stout
nails
upward
and
upward
we
built
cutting
windows
in
the
trunk
as
we
required
to
admit
light
and
air
until
we
were
flush
with
the
top
of
the
center
pole
on
this
pole
we
erected
another
to
reach
the
top
of
the
tree
and
securing
it
firmly
built
in
the
same
way
round
it
until
we
at
length
reached
the
level
of
the
floor
of
the
nest
above
to
make
the
ascent
of
the
stairs
perfectly
easy
we
ran
a
on
either
side
one
round
the
center
pillar
and
the
other
following
the
curve
of
the
trunk
this
task
occupied
us
a
whole
month
and
by
the
end
of
that
period
so
accustomed
had
we
become
to
having
a
definite
piece
of
work
before
us
that
we
began
to
consider
what
other
great
alteration
we
should
undertake
we
were
however
of
course
not
neglecting
the
details
of
our
colonial
establishment
there
were
all
the
animals
to
be
attended
to
the
goats
and
sheep
had
both
presented
us
with
additions
to
our
flock
and
these
frisky
youngsters
had
to
be
seen
after
to
prevent
them
straying
to
any
great
distance
for
we
had
no
wish
to
lose
them
we
tied
round
their
necks
little
bells
which
we
had
found
on
board
the
wreck
and
which
would
assist
us
to
track
them
juno
too
had
a
fine
litter
of
puppies
but
in
spite
of
the
entreaties
of
the
children
i
could
not
consent
to
keep
more
than
two
and
the
rest
disappeared
in
that
mysterious
way
in
which
puppies
and
kittens
are
wont
to
leave
the
earth
to
console
the
mother
as
he
said
but
also
i
suspect
to
save
himself
considerable
trouble
jack
placed
his
little
jackal
beside
the
remaining
puppies
and
to
his
joy
found
it
readily
adopted
the
other
pets
were
also
flourishing
and
were
being
usefully
trained
the
buffalo
after
giving
us
much
trouble
had
now
become
perfectly
domesticated
and
was
a
very
useful
beast
of
burden
besides
being
a
capital
steed
for
the
boys
they
guided
him
by
a
bar
thrust
through
the
hole
in
his
nose
which
was
now
perfectly
healed
and
this
served
the
purpose
just
as
a
bit
in
the
mouth
of
a
horse
i
began
his
education
by
securing
round
him
a
broad
girth
of
buffalo
hide
and
fastening
to
it
various
articles
to
accustom
him
to
carrying
a
burden
by
degrees
he
permitted
this
to
be
done
without
making
the
slightest
resistance
and
soon
carried
the
panniers
before
borne
by
the
ass
readily
and
willingly
i
then
made
master
knips
sit
upon
his
back
and
hold
the
reins
i
had
prepared
for
him
that
the
animal
might
become
accustomed
to
the
feeling
of
a
rider
and
finally
allowed
fritz
himself
to
mount
the
education
of
the
eagle
was
not
neglected
fritz
every
day
shot
small
birds
for
his
food
and
these
he
placed
sometimes
between
the
horns
of
the
buffalo
or
goat
and
sometimes
upon
the
back
of
the
great
bustard
that
he
might
become
accustomed
to
pounce
upon
living
prey
these
lessons
had
their
due
effect
and
the
bird
having
been
taught
to
obey
the
voice
and
whistle
of
his
master
he
was
soon
allowed
to
bring
down
small
birds
upon
the
wing
when
he
stooped
and
struck
his
quarry
in
most
sportsmanlike
manner
we
kept
him
well
away
from
the
poultry
yard
lest
his
natural
instincts
should
show
themselves
and
he
should
put
an
untimely
end
to
some
of
our
feathered
pets
neither
was
master
knips
allowed
to
remain
idle
for
ernest
now
that
he
was
in
his
possession
wished
to
train
him
to
be
of
some
use
with
jack
help
he
made
a
little
basket
of
rushes
which
he
so
arranged
with
straps
that
it
might
be
easily
fitted
on
to
the
monkey
back
thus
equipped
he
was
taught
to
mount
cocoanut
palms
and
other
lofty
trees
and
to
bring
down
their
fruit
in
the
hamper
jack
was
not
so
successful
in
his
educational
attempts
fangs
as
he
had
christened
his
jackal
used
his
fangs
indeed
but
only
on
his
own
account
nothing
could
persuade
him
that
the
animals
he
caught
were
not
at
once
to
be
devoured
consequently
poor
jack
was
never
able
to
save
from
his
jaws
anything
but
the
tattered
skin
of
his
prey
not
disheartened
however
he
determined
that
fangs
could
be
trained
and
that
he
would
train
him
these
and
such
like
employments
afforded
us
the
rest
and
recreation
we
required
while
engaged
in
the
laborious
task
of
staircase
building
among
minor
occupations
i
applied
myself
to
the
improvement
of
our
candles
though
the
former
batch
had
greatly
delighted
us
at
first
yet
we
were
soon
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
the
light
they
gave
was
imperfect
and
their
appearance
was
unsightly
my
wife
too
begged
me
to
find
some
substitute
for
the
threads
of
our
cotton
neckties
which
i
had
previously
used
as
wicks
to
give
the
proper
shape
and
smoothness
to
the
candles
i
determined
to
use
the
bamboo
molds
i
had
prepared
my
first
idea
was
to
pour
the
wax
in
at
the
end
of
the
mold
and
then
when
the
candles
were
cooled
to
slip
them
out
but
i
was
soon
convinced
that
this
plan
would
not
succeed
i
therefore
determined
to
divide
the
molds
lengthways
and
then
having
greased
them
well
we
might
pour
the
melted
wax
into
the
two
halves
bound
tightly
together
and
so
be
able
to
take
out
the
candles
when
cool
without
injuring
them
the
wicks
were
my
next
difficulty
and
as
the
mother
positively
refused
to
allow
us
to
devote
our
ties
and
handkerchiefs
for
the
purpose
i
took
a
piece
of
inflammable
wood
from
a
tree
a
native
of
the
antilles
which
i
thought
would
serve
our
purpose
this
i
cut
into
long
slips
and
fixed
in
the
centers
of
the
molds
my
wife
too
prepared
some
wicks
from
the
fibers
of
the
karata
tree
which
she
declared
would
beat
mine
completely
out
of
the
field
we
put
them
to
the
proof
on
a
large
fire
we
placed
a
pot
in
which
we
prepared
our
wax
mixture
half
beeswax
and
half
wax
from
the
candleberries
the
molds
carefully
prepared
half
with
karata
fiber
and
half
with
wooden
splint
wicks
stood
on
their
ends
in
a
tub
of
cold
water
ready
to
receive
the
wax
they
were
filled
the
wax
cooled
the
candles
taken
out
and
subjected
to
the
criticism
of
all
hands
when
night
drew
on
they
were
formally
tested
the
decision
was
unanimous
neither
gave
such
a
good
light
as
those
with
the
cotton
wicks
but
even
my
wife
declared
that
the
light
from
mine
was
far
preferable
to
that
emitted
by
hers
for
the
former
though
rather
flaring
burned
brilliantly
while
the
latter
gave
out
such
a
feeble
and
flickering
flame
that
it
was
almost
useless
i
then
turned
shoemaker
for
i
had
promised
myself
a
pair
of
waterproof
boots
and
now
determined
to
make
them
taking
a
pair
of
socks
i
filled
them
with
sand
and
then
coated
them
over
with
a
thin
layer
of
clay
to
form
a
convenient
mold
this
was
soon
hardened
in
the
sun
and
was
ready
for
use
layer
after
layer
of
caoutchouc
i
brushed
over
it
allowing
each
layer
to
dry
before
the
next
was
put
on
until
at
length
i
considered
that
the
shoes
were
of
sufficient
thickness
i
dried
them
broke
out
the
clay
secured
with
nails
a
strip
of
buffalo
hide
to
the
soles
brushed
that
over
with
caoutchouc
and
i
had
a
pair
of
comfortable
durable
waterproof
boots
i
was
delighted
orders
poured
in
from
all
sides
and
soon
everyone
in
the
family
was
likewise
provided
for
one
objection
to
falconhurst
was
the
absence
of
any
spring
close
by
so
that
the
boys
were
obliged
to
bring
water
daily
from
the
stream
and
this
involving
no
little
trouble
it
was
proposed
that
we
should
carry
the
water
by
pipes
from
the
stream
to
our
present
residence
a
dam
had
to
be
thrown
across
the
river
some
way
up
stream
that
the
water
might
be
raised
to
a
sufficient
height
to
run
to
falconhurst
from
the
reservoir
thus
made
we
led
the
water
down
by
pipes
into
the
shell
which
we
placed
near
our
dwelling
and
from
which
the
superfluous
water
flowed
off
through
the
hole
made
in
it
by
fritz
harpoon
this
was
an
immense
convenience
and
we
formally
inaugurated
the
trough
by
washing
therein
a
whole
sack
of
potatoes
thus
day
after
day
brought
its
own
work
and
day
after
day
saw
that
work
completed
we
had
no
time
to
be
idle
or
to
lament
our
separation
from
our
fellow
creatures
one
morning
as
we
were
completing
our
spiral
staircase
and
giving
it
such
finish
as
we
were
capable
of
we
were
suddenly
alarmed
by
hearing
a
most
terrific
noise
the
roaring
or
bellowing
of
a
wild
beast
so
strange
a
sound
was
it
that
i
could
not
imagine
by
what
animal
it
was
uttered
jack
thought
it
perhaps
a
lion
fritz
hazarded
a
gorilla
while
ernest
gave
it
as
his
opinion
and
i
thought
it
possible
that
he
was
right
that
it
was
a
hyena
whatever
it
is
said
i
we
must
prepare
to
receive
it
up
with
you
all
to
the
nest
while
i
secure
the
door
then
arming
the
dogs
with
their
collars
i
sent
them
out
to
protect
the
animals
below
closed
the
door
and
joined
my
family
every
gun
was
loaded
every
eye
was
upon
the
watch
the
sound
drew
nearer
and
then
all
was
still
nothing
was
to
be
seen
i
determined
to
descend
and
reconnoiter
and
fritz
and
i
carefully
crept
down
with
our
guns
at
full
cock
we
glided
among
the
trees
noiselessly
and
quickly
we
pushed
on
further
and
further
suddenly
close
by
we
heard
the
terrific
sound
again
fritz
raised
his
gun
but
almost
as
quickly
again
dropped
it
and
burst
into
a
hearty
fit
of
laughter
there
was
no
mistaking
those
dulcet
tones
resounded
through
the
forest
and
our
ass
braying
his
approach
right
merrily
appeared
in
sight
to
our
surprise
however
our
friend
was
not
alone
behind
him
trotted
another
animal
an
ass
no
doubt
but
slim
and
graceful
as
a
horse
we
watched
their
movements
anxiously
fritz
i
whispered
that
is
an
onager
creep
back
to
falconhurst
and
bring
me
a
piece
of
cord
quietly
now
while
he
was
gone
i
cut
a
bamboo
and
split
it
down
to
form
a
pair
of
pincers
which
i
knew
would
be
of
use
to
me
should
i
get
near
the
animal
fritz
soon
returned
with
the
cord
and
i
was
glad
to
observe
also
brought
some
oats
and
salt
we
made
one
end
of
the
cord
fast
to
a
tree
and
at
the
other
end
made
a
running
noose
silently
we
watched
the
animals
as
they
approached
quietly
browsing
fritz
then
arose
holding
in
one
hand
the
noose
and
in
the
other
some
oats
and
salt
the
ass
seeing
his
favorite
food
thus
held
out
advanced
to
take
it
fritz
allowed
him
to
do
so
and
he
was
soon
munching
contentedly
the
stranger
on
seeing
fritz
started
back
but
finding
her
companion
show
no
signs
of
alarm
was
reassured
and
soon
approached
sniffing
and
was
about
to
take
some
of
the
tempting
food
in
a
moment
the
noose
left
fritz
adroit
hand
and
fell
round
her
neck
with
a
single
bound
she
sprang
backward
the
full
length
of
the
cord
the
noose
drew
tight
and
she
fell
to
the
earth
half
strangled
i
at
once
ran
up
loosened
the
rope
and
replaced
it
by
a
halter
and
placing
the
pincers
upon
her
nose
secured
her
by
two
cords
fastened
between
two
trees
and
then
left
her
to
recover
herself
everyone
hastened
up
to
examine
the
beautiful
animal
as
she
rose
to
the
ground
and
cast
fiery
glances
around
she
lashed
out
with
her
heels
on
every
side
and
giving
vent
to
angry
snorts
struggled
violently
to
get
free
all
her
endeavors
were
vain
the
cords
were
stout
and
after
a
while
she
quieted
down
and
stood
exhausted
and
quivering
i
then
approached
she
suffered
me
to
lead
her
to
the
roots
of
our
tree
which
for
the
present
formed
our
stables
and
there
i
tied
her
up
close
to
the
donkey
who
was
likewise
prevented
from
playing
truant
next
morning
i
found
the
onager
after
her
night
rest
as
wild
as
ever
and
as
i
looked
at
the
handsome
creature
i
almost
despaired
of
ever
taming
her
proud
spirit
every
expedient
was
tried
and
at
length
when
the
animal
was
subdued
by
hunger
i
thought
i
might
venture
to
mount
her
and
having
given
her
the
strongest
curb
and
shackled
her
feet
i
attempted
to
do
so
she
was
as
unruly
as
ever
and
as
a
last
expedient
i
resolved
to
adopt
a
plan
which
though
cruel
was
i
knew
attended
with
wonderful
success
by
the
american
indians
by
whom
it
is
practiced
watching
a
favorable
opportunity
i
sprang
upon
the
onager
back
and
seizing
her
long
ear
in
my
teeth
in
spite
of
her
kicking
and
plunging
bit
it
through
the
result
was
marvelous
the
animal
ceased
plunging
and
quivering
violently
stood
stock
still
from
that
moment
we
were
her
masters
the
children
mounted
her
one
after
the
other
and
she
carried
them
obediently
and
quietly
proud
indeed
did
i
feel
as
i
watched
this
animal
which
naturalists
and
travelers
have
declared
to
be
beyond
the
power
of
man
to
tame
guided
hither
and
thither
by
my
youngest
son
additions
to
our
poultry
yard
reminded
me
of
the
necessity
of
providing
some
substantial
shelter
for
our
animals
before
the
rainy
season
came
on
three
broods
of
chickens
had
been
successfully
hatched
and
the
little
creatures
forty
in
all
were
my
wife
pride
and
delight
we
began
by
making
a
roof
over
the
vaulted
roots
of
our
tree
forming
the
framework
of
bamboo
canes
which
we
laid
close
together
and
bound
tightly
down
others
we
fixed
below
as
supports
the
interstices
were
filled
up
with
clay
and
moss
and
coating
the
whole
over
with
a
mixture
of
tar
and
we
obtained
a
firm
balcony
and
a
capital
roof
impervious
to
the
severest
fall
of
rain
i
ran
a
light
rail
round
the
balcony
to
give
it
a
more
ornamental
appearance
and
below
divided
the
building
into
several
compartments
stables
poultry
yard
hay
and
provision
lofts
dairy
kitchen
larder
and
were
united
under
one
roof
our
winter
quarters
were
now
completed
and
we
had
but
to
store
them
with
food
day
after
day
we
worked
bringing
in
provisions
of
every
description
as
we
were
one
evening
returning
from
gathering
potatoes
it
struck
me
that
we
should
take
in
a
store
of
acorns
and
sending
the
two
younger
boys
home
with
their
mother
and
the
cart
i
took
a
large
canvas
bag
and
with
fritz
and
ernest
the
former
mounted
on
his
onager
and
the
latter
carrying
his
little
favorite
knips
made
a
detour
toward
the
acorn
wood
we
reached
the
spot
tied
lightfoot
to
a
neighboring
tree
and
began
rapidly
to
fill
the
sack
as
we
were
thus
engaged
knips
sprang
suddenly
into
a
bush
close
by
from
which
a
moment
afterward
issued
such
strange
cries
that
ernest
followed
to
see
what
could
be
the
matter
come
he
shouted
come
and
help
me
i
got
a
couple
of
birds
and
their
eggs
quick
ruffed
grouse
we
hurried
to
the
spot
there
was
ernest
with
a
fluttering
screaming
bird
in
either
hand
while
with
his
foot
he
was
endeavoring
to
prevent
his
greedy
little
monkey
from
seizing
the
eggs
we
quickly
tied
the
legs
of
the
birds
and
removing
the
eggs
from
the
nest
placed
them
in
ernest
hat
while
he
gathered
some
of
the
long
broad
grass
with
which
the
nest
was
woven
and
which
grew
luxuriantly
around
for
franz
to
play
at
with
we
then
loaded
the
onager
with
the
acorns
and
moved
homeward
the
eggs
i
covered
carefully
with
dry
moss
that
they
might
be
kept
warm
and
as
soon
as
possible
i
handed
them
over
to
my
wife
who
managed
the
mother
so
cleverly
that
she
induced
her
to
return
to
the
eggs
and
in
a
few
days
to
our
great
delight
we
had
fifteen
beautiful
little
canadian
chicks
franz
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
swords
his
brother
brought
him
but
having
no
small
companion
on
whom
to
exercise
his
valor
he
amused
himself
for
a
short
time
in
hewing
down
imaginary
foes
and
then
cut
the
reeds
in
slips
and
plaited
them
to
form
a
whip
for
lightfoot
the
leaves
seemed
so
pliable
and
strong
that
i
examined
them
to
see
to
what
further
use
they
might
be
put
their
tissue
was
composed
of
long
silky
fibers
a
sudden
thought
struck
me
this
must
be
new
zealand
flax
i
could
not
rest
till
i
had
announced
this
invaluable
discovery
to
my
wife
she
was
no
less
delighted
than
i
was
bring
me
the
leaves
she
exclaimed
oh
what
a
delightful
discovery
no
one
shall
now
be
clothed
in
rags
just
make
me
a
spindle
and
you
shall
soon
have
shirts
and
stockings
and
trousers
all
good
homespun
quick
fritz
and
bring
your
mother
more
leaves
we
could
not
help
smiling
at
her
eager
zeal
but
fritz
and
ernest
sprang
on
their
steeds
and
soon
the
onager
and
buffalo
were
galloping
home
again
each
laden
with
a
great
bundle
of
flax
the
boys
dismounted
and
deposited
their
offering
at
their
mother
feet
capital
she
exclaimed
i
shall
now
show
you
that
i
am
not
at
all
behindhand
in
ingenuity
this
must
be
retted
carded
spun
and
woven
and
then
with
scissors
needle
and
thread
i
will
make
you
any
article
of
clothing
you
choose
we
decided
that
flamingo
marsh
would
be
the
best
spot
for
the
operation
of
steeping
or
retting
the
flax
and
next
morning
we
set
out
thither
with
the
cart
drawn
by
the
ass
and
laden
with
the
bundles
between
which
sat
franz
and
knips
while
the
rest
of
us
followed
with
spades
and
hatchets
i
described
to
my
boys
as
we
went
along
the
process
of
retting
and
explained
to
them
how
steeping
the
flax
leaves
destroys
the
useless
membrane
while
the
strong
fibers
remain
as
we
were
employed
in
making
beds
for
the
flax
and
placing
it
in
them
we
observed
several
nests
of
the
flamingo
these
are
most
curiously
and
skillfully
made
of
glutinous
clay
so
strong
that
they
can
neither
be
overturned
nor
washed
away
they
are
formed
in
the
shape
of
blunted
cones
and
placed
point
downward
at
the
upper
and
broader
end
is
built
a
little
platform
to
contain
the
eggs
on
which
the
female
bird
sits
with
her
long
legs
in
the
water
on
either
side
until
the
little
birds
are
hatched
and
can
take
to
the
water
for
a
fortnight
we
left
the
flax
to
steep
and
then
taking
it
out
and
drying
it
thoroughly
in
the
sun
stored
it
for
future
use
at
falconhurst
daily
did
we
load
our
cart
with
provisions
to
be
brought
to
our
winter
quarters
manioc
potatoes
cocoanuts
sweet
acorns
were
all
collected
and
stored
in
abundance
for
grumbling
thunder
lowering
skies
and
sharp
showers
warned
us
that
we
had
no
time
to
lose
our
corn
was
sowed
our
animals
housed
our
provisions
stored
when
down
came
the
rain
to
continue
in
our
nest
we
found
impossible
and
we
were
obliged
to
retreat
to
the
trunk
where
we
carried
such
of
our
domestic
furniture
as
might
have
been
injured
by
the
damp
our
dwelling
was
indeed
crowded
the
animals
and
provisions
below
and
our
beds
and
household
goods
around
us
hemmed
us
in
on
every
side
by
dint
of
patience
and
better
packing
we
obtained
sufficient
room
to
work
and
lie
down
in
by
degrees
too
we
became
accustomed
to
the
continual
noise
of
the
animals
and
the
smell
of
the
stables
the
smoke
from
the
fire
which
we
were
occasionally
obliged
to
light
was
not
agreeable
but
in
time
even
that
seemed
to
become
more
bearable
to
make
more
space
we
turned
such
animals
as
we
had
captured
and
who
therefore
might
be
imagined
to
know
how
to
shift
for
themselves
outside
during
the
daytime
bringing
them
under
the
arched
roots
only
at
night
to
perform
this
duty
fritz
and
i
used
to
sally
forth
every
evening
and
as
regularly
every
evening
did
we
return
soaked
to
the
skin
to
obviate
this
the
mother
who
feared
these
continual
wettings
might
injure
our
health
contrived
waterproofs
she
brushed
on
several
layers
of
caoutchouc
over
stout
shirts
to
which
she
attached
hoods
she
then
fixed
to
these
duck
trousers
and
thus
prepared
for
each
of
us
a
complete
waterproof
suit
clad
in
which
we
might
brave
the
severest
rain
in
spite
of
our
endeavors
to
keep
ourselves
busy
the
time
dragged
heavily
our
mornings
were
occupied
in
tending
the
animals
the
boys
amused
themselves
with
their
pets
and
assisted
me
in
the
manufacture
of
and
a
spindle
for
the
mother
the
combs
i
made
with
nails
which
i
placed
head
downward
on
a
sheet
of
tin
about
an
inch
wide
holding
the
nails
in
their
proper
positions
i
poured
solder
round
their
heads
to
fix
them
to
the
tin
which
i
then
folded
down
on
either
side
of
them
to
keep
them
perfectly
firm
in
the
evening
when
our
room
was
illuminated
with
wax
candles
i
wrote
a
journal
of
all
the
events
which
had
occurred
since
our
arrival
in
this
foreign
land
and
while
the
mother
was
busy
with
her
needle
and
ernest
making
sketches
of
birds
beasts
and
flowers
with
which
he
had
met
during
the
past
months
fritz
and
jack
taught
little
franz
to
read
week
after
week
rolled
by
week
after
week
saw
us
still
close
prisoners
incessant
rain
battered
down
above
us
constant
gloom
hung
over
the
desolate
scene
chapter
ix
the
salt
palace
and
the
new
farmhouse
the
winds
at
length
were
lulled
the
sun
shot
his
brilliant
rays
through
the
riven
clouds
the
rain
ceased
to
fall
spring
had
come
no
prisoners
set
at
liberty
could
have
felt
more
joy
than
we
did
as
we
stepped
forth
from
our
winter
abode
refreshed
our
eyes
with
the
pleasant
verdure
around
us
and
our
ears
with
the
merry
songs
of
a
thousand
happy
birds
and
drank
in
the
pure
balmy
air
of
spring
our
plantations
were
thriving
vigorously
the
seed
we
had
sown
was
shooting
through
the
moist
earth
all
nature
was
refreshed
our
nest
was
our
first
care
filled
with
leaves
and
broken
and
torn
by
the
wind
it
looked
indeed
dilapidated
we
worked
hard
and
in
a
few
days
it
was
again
habitable
my
wife
begged
that
i
would
now
start
her
with
the
flax
and
as
early
as
possible
i
built
a
and
then
prepared
it
for
her
use
i
also
after
some
trouble
manufactured
a
and
and
she
and
franz
were
soon
hard
at
work
the
little
boy
reeling
off
the
thread
his
mother
spun
i
was
anxious
to
visit
tentholm
for
i
feared
that
much
of
our
precious
stores
might
have
suffered
fritz
and
i
made
an
excursion
thither
the
damage
done
to
falconhurst
was
as
nothing
compared
to
the
scene
that
awaited
us
the
tent
was
blown
to
the
ground
the
canvas
torn
to
rags
the
provisions
soaked
and
two
casks
of
powder
utterly
destroyed
we
immediately
spread
such
things
as
we
hoped
yet
to
preserve
in
the
sun
to
dry
the
pinnace
was
safe
but
our
faithful
was
dashed
in
pieces
and
the
irreparable
damage
we
had
sustained
made
me
resolve
to
contrive
some
safer
and
more
stable
before
the
arrival
of
the
next
rainy
season
fritz
proposed
that
we
should
hollow
out
a
cave
in
the
rock
and
though
the
difficulties
such
an
undertaking
would
present
appeared
almost
insurmountable
i
yet
determined
to
make
the
attempt
we
might
not
i
thought
hew
out
a
cavern
of
sufficient
size
to
serve
as
a
room
but
we
might
at
least
make
a
cellar
for
the
more
valuable
and
perishable
of
our
stores
some
days
afterward
we
left
falconhurst
with
the
cart
laden
with
a
cargo
of
spades
hammers
chisels
pickaxes
and
crowbars
and
began
our
undertaking
on
the
smooth
face
of
the
perpendicular
rock
i
drew
out
in
chalk
the
size
of
the
proposed
entrance
and
then
with
minds
bent
on
success
we
battered
away
six
days
of
hard
and
incessant
toil
made
but
little
impression
i
do
not
think
that
the
hole
would
have
been
a
satisfactory
shelter
for
even
master
knips
but
we
still
did
not
despair
and
were
presently
rewarded
by
coming
to
softer
and
more
yielding
substance
our
work
progressed
and
our
minds
were
relieved
on
the
tenth
day
as
our
persevering
blows
were
falling
heavily
jack
who
was
working
diligently
with
a
hammer
and
crowbar
shouted
gone
father
fritz
my
bar
has
gone
through
the
mountain
run
round
and
get
it
laughed
fritz
perhaps
it
has
dropped
into
europe
you
must
not
lose
a
good
crowbar
but
really
it
is
through
it
went
right
through
the
rock
i
heard
it
crash
down
inside
oh
do
come
and
see
he
shouted
excitedly
we
sprang
to
his
side
and
i
thrust
the
handle
of
my
hammer
into
the
hole
he
spoke
of
it
met
with
no
opposition
i
could
turn
it
in
any
direction
i
chose
fritz
handed
me
a
long
pole
i
tried
the
depth
with
that
nothing
could
i
feel
a
thin
wall
then
was
all
that
intervened
between
us
and
a
great
cavern
with
a
shout
of
joy
the
boys
battered
vigorously
at
the
rock
piece
by
piece
fell
and
soon
the
hole
was
large
enough
for
us
to
enter
i
stepped
near
the
aperture
and
was
about
to
make
a
further
examination
when
a
sudden
rush
of
poisonous
air
turned
me
giddy
and
shouting
to
my
sons
to
stand
off
i
leaned
against
the
rock
when
i
came
to
myself
i
explained
to
them
the
danger
of
approaching
any
cavern
or
other
place
where
the
air
has
for
a
long
time
been
stagnant
unless
air
is
incessantly
renewed
it
becomes
vitiated
i
said
and
fatal
to
those
who
breathe
it
the
safest
way
of
restoring
it
to
its
original
state
is
to
subject
it
to
the
action
of
fire
a
few
handfuls
of
blazing
hay
thrown
into
this
hole
may
if
the
place
be
small
sufficiently
purify
the
air
within
to
allow
us
to
enter
without
danger
we
tried
the
experiment
the
flame
was
extinguished
the
instant
it
entered
though
bundles
of
blazing
grass
were
thrown
in
no
difference
was
made
i
saw
that
we
must
apply
some
more
efficacious
remedy
and
sent
the
boys
for
a
chest
of
signal
rockets
we
had
brought
from
the
wreck
we
let
fly
some
dozens
of
these
fiery
serpents
which
went
whizzing
in
and
disappeared
at
apparently
a
vast
distance
from
us
some
flew
like
radiant
meteors
round
lighted
up
the
mighty
circumference
and
displayed
as
by
a
magician
wand
a
sparkling
glittering
roof
they
looked
like
avenging
dragons
driving
a
foul
malignant
fiend
out
of
a
beauteous
palace
we
waited
for
a
little
while
after
these
experiments
and
i
then
again
threw
in
lighted
hay
it
burned
clearly
the
air
was
purified
fritz
and
i
enlarged
the
opening
while
jack
springing
on
his
buffalo
thundered
away
to
falconhurst
to
bear
the
great
and
astonishing
news
to
his
mother
great
must
have
been
the
effect
of
jack
eloquence
on
those
at
home
for
the
timbers
of
the
bridge
were
soon
again
resounding
under
the
swift
but
heavy
tramp
of
his
steed
and
he
was
quickly
followed
by
the
rest
of
our
party
in
the
cart
all
were
in
the
highest
state
of
excitement
jack
had
stowed
in
the
cart
all
the
candles
he
could
find
and
we
now
lighting
these
shouldered
our
arms
and
entered
i
led
the
way
sounding
the
ground
as
i
advanced
with
a
long
pole
that
we
might
not
fall
unexpectedly
into
any
great
hole
or
chasm
silently
we
marched
the
mother
the
boys
and
even
the
dogs
seeming
overawed
with
the
grandeur
and
beauty
of
the
scene
we
were
in
a
grotto
of
diamonds
a
vast
cave
of
glittering
crystal
the
candles
reflected
on
the
walls
a
golden
light
bright
as
the
stars
of
heaven
while
great
crystal
pillars
rose
from
the
floor
like
mighty
trees
mingling
their
branches
high
above
us
and
drooping
in
hundreds
of
stalactites
which
sparkled
and
glittered
with
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
the
floor
of
this
magnificent
palace
was
formed
of
hard
dry
sand
so
dry
that
i
saw
at
once
that
we
might
safely
take
up
our
abode
therein
without
the
slightest
fear
of
danger
from
damp
from
the
appearance
of
the
brilliant
crystals
round
about
us
i
suspected
their
nature
i
tasted
a
piece
this
was
a
cavern
of
rock
salt
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
here
was
an
unlimited
supply
of
the
best
and
purest
salt
but
one
thing
detracted
from
my
entire
satisfaction
and
delight
large
crystals
lay
scattered
here
and
there
which
detached
from
the
roof
had
fallen
to
the
ground
this
if
apt
to
recur
would
keep
us
in
constant
peril
i
examined
some
of
the
masses
and
discovered
that
they
had
been
all
recently
separated
and
therefore
concluded
that
the
concussion
of
the
air
occasioned
by
the
rockets
had
caused
their
fall
to
satisfy
ourselves
however
that
there
were
no
more
pieces
tottering
above
us
we
discharged
our
guns
from
the
entrance
and
watched
the
effect
nothing
more
fell
our
magnificent
abode
was
safe
we
returned
to
falconhurst
with
minds
full
of
wonder
at
our
new
discovery
and
plans
for
turning
it
to
the
best
possible
advantage
nothing
was
now
talked
of
but
the
new
house
how
it
should
be
arranged
how
it
should
be
fitted
up
the
safety
and
comfort
of
falconhurst
which
had
at
first
seemed
so
great
now
dwindled
away
in
our
opinion
to
nothing
it
should
be
kept
up
we
decided
merely
as
a
summer
residence
while
our
cave
should
be
formed
into
a
winter
house
and
impregnable
castle
our
attention
was
now
fully
occupied
with
this
new
house
light
and
air
were
to
be
admitted
so
we
hewed
a
row
of
windows
in
the
rock
where
we
fitted
the
window
cases
we
had
brought
from
the
cabins
we
brought
the
door
too
from
falconhurst
and
fitted
it
in
the
aperture
we
had
made
the
opening
in
the
trunk
of
the
tree
i
determined
to
conceal
with
bark
as
less
likely
to
attract
the
notice
of
wild
beasts
or
savages
should
they
approach
during
our
absence
the
cave
itself
we
divided
into
four
parts
in
front
a
large
compartment
into
which
the
door
opened
subdivided
into
our
sitting
eating
and
sleeping
apartments
the
righthand
division
containing
our
kitchen
and
workshop
and
the
left
our
stables
behind
all
this
in
the
dark
recesses
of
the
cave
was
our
storehouse
and
having
already
undergone
one
rainy
season
we
knew
well
its
discomforts
and
thought
of
many
useful
arrangements
in
the
laying
out
of
our
dwelling
we
did
not
intend
to
be
again
we
therefore
contrived
a
properly
built
fire
place
and
chimney
our
stable
arrangements
too
were
better
and
plenty
of
space
was
left
in
our
workshop
that
we
should
not
be
hampered
in
even
the
most
extensive
operations
our
frequent
residence
at
tentholm
revealed
to
us
several
important
advantages
which
we
had
not
numbers
of
splendid
turtles
often
came
ashore
to
deposit
their
eggs
in
the
sand
and
their
delicious
flesh
afforded
us
many
a
sumptuous
meal
when
more
than
one
of
these
creatures
appeared
at
a
time
we
used
to
cut
off
their
retreat
to
the
sea
and
turning
them
on
their
backs
fasten
them
to
a
stake
driven
in
close
by
the
water
edge
by
a
cord
passed
through
a
hole
in
their
shell
we
thus
had
fresh
turtle
continually
within
our
reach
for
the
animals
throve
well
thus
secured
and
appeared
in
as
good
condition
after
having
been
kept
thus
for
several
weeks
as
others
when
freshly
caught
lobsters
crabs
and
mussels
also
abounded
on
the
shore
but
this
was
not
all
an
additional
surprise
awaited
us
as
we
were
one
morning
approaching
tentholm
we
were
attracted
by
a
most
curious
phenomenon
the
waters
out
at
sea
appeared
agitated
by
some
unseen
movement
and
as
they
heaved
and
boiled
their
surface
struck
by
the
beams
of
the
morning
sun
seemed
illuminated
by
flashes
of
fire
over
the
water
where
this
disturbance
was
taking
place
hovered
hundreds
of
birds
screaming
loudly
which
ever
and
anon
would
dart
downward
some
plunging
beneath
the
water
some
skimming
the
surface
then
again
they
would
rise
and
resume
their
harsh
cries
the
shining
sparkling
mass
then
rolled
onward
and
approached
in
a
direct
line
our
bay
followed
by
the
feathered
flock
above
we
hurried
down
to
the
shore
to
further
examine
this
strange
sight
i
was
convinced
as
we
approached
that
it
was
a
shoal
or
bank
of
herrings
no
sooner
did
i
give
utterance
to
my
conjecture
than
i
was
assailed
by
a
host
of
questions
concerning
this
what
it
was
and
what
occasioned
it
a
i
said
is
composed
of
an
immense
number
of
herrings
swimming
together
i
can
scarcely
express
to
you
the
huge
size
of
this
living
bank
which
extends
over
a
great
area
many
fathoms
deep
it
is
followed
by
numbers
of
great
ravenous
fish
who
devour
quantities
of
the
herrings
while
above
hover
birds
as
you
have
just
seen
ready
to
pounce
down
on
stragglers
near
the
top
to
escape
these
enemies
the
shoal
makes
for
the
nearest
shore
and
seeks
safety
in
those
shallows
where
the
large
fish
can
not
follow
but
here
it
meets
with
a
third
great
enemy
it
may
escape
from
the
fish
and
elude
the
vigilance
of
birds
but
from
the
ingenuity
of
man
it
can
find
no
escape
in
one
year
millions
of
these
fish
are
caught
and
yet
the
roes
of
only
a
small
number
would
be
sufficient
to
supply
as
many
fish
again
soon
our
fishery
was
in
operation
jack
and
fritz
stood
in
the
water
with
baskets
and
baled
out
the
fish
as
one
bales
water
with
a
bucket
throwing
them
to
us
on
the
shore
as
quickly
as
possible
we
cleaned
them
and
placed
them
in
casks
with
salt
first
a
layer
of
salt
and
then
a
layer
of
herrings
and
so
on
until
we
had
ready
many
casks
of
pickled
fish
as
the
barrels
were
filled
we
closed
them
carefully
and
rolled
them
away
to
the
cool
vaults
at
the
back
of
our
cave
our
good
fortune
however
was
not
to
end
here
a
day
after
the
herring
fishery
was
over
and
the
shoal
had
left
our
bay
a
great
number
of
seals
appeared
attracted
by
the
refuse
of
the
herrings
which
we
had
thrown
into
the
sea
though
i
feared
they
would
not
be
suitable
for
our
table
we
yet
secured
a
score
or
two
for
the
sake
of
their
skins
and
fat
the
skins
we
drew
carefully
off
for
harness
and
clothing
and
the
fat
we
boiled
down
for
oil
which
we
put
aside
in
casks
for
tanning
and
burning
in
lamps
these
occupations
interfered
for
some
time
with
our
work
at
rock
house
but
as
soon
as
possible
we
again
returned
to
our
labor
with
renewed
vigor
i
had
noticed
that
the
salt
crystals
had
for
their
base
a
species
of
gypsum
which
i
knew
might
be
made
of
great
service
to
us
in
our
building
operations
as
plaster
as
an
experiment
i
broke
off
some
pieces
and
after
subjecting
them
to
great
heat
reduced
them
to
powder
the
plaster
this
formed
with
water
was
smooth
and
white
and
as
i
had
then
no
particular
use
to
which
i
might
put
it
i
plastered
over
some
of
the
herring
casks
that
i
might
be
perfectly
certain
that
all
air
was
excluded
the
remainder
of
the
casks
i
left
as
they
were
for
i
presently
intended
to
preserve
their
contents
by
smoking
to
do
this
the
boys
and
i
built
a
small
hut
of
reeds
and
branches
and
then
we
strung
our
herrings
on
lines
across
the
roof
on
the
floor
we
lit
a
great
fire
of
brushwood
and
moss
which
threw
out
a
dense
smoke
curling
in
volumes
round
the
fish
and
they
in
a
few
days
seemed
perfectly
cured
about
a
month
after
the
appearance
of
the
herrings
we
were
favored
by
a
visit
from
other
shoals
of
fish
jack
espied
them
first
and
called
to
us
that
a
lot
of
young
whales
were
off
the
coast
we
ran
down
and
discovered
the
bay
apparently
swarming
with
great
sturgeon
salmon
and
trout
all
making
for
the
mouth
of
jackal
river
that
they
might
ascend
it
and
deposit
their
spawn
among
the
stones
jack
was
delighted
at
his
discovery
here
are
proper
fish
he
exclaimed
none
of
your
paltry
fry
how
do
you
preserve
these
sorts
of
fish
potted
salted
or
smoked
not
so
fast
said
i
not
so
fast
tell
me
how
they
are
to
be
caught
and
i
will
tell
you
how
they
are
to
be
cooked
oh
i
catch
them
fast
enough
he
replied
and
darted
off
to
rock
house
while
i
was
still
puzzling
my
brains
as
to
how
i
should
set
to
work
he
returned
with
his
fishing
apparatus
in
hand
a
bow
and
arrow
and
a
ball
of
twine
at
the
he
had
fastened
a
barbed
spike
and
had
secured
the
arrow
to
the
end
of
the
string
armed
with
this
weapon
he
advanced
to
the
river
edge
his
arrow
flew
from
the
bow
and
to
my
surprise
struck
one
of
the
largest
fish
in
the
side
help
father
help
he
cried
as
the
great
fish
darted
off
carrying
arrow
and
all
with
it
help
or
he
will
pull
me
into
the
water
illustration
help
or
he
will
pull
me
into
the
water
i
ran
to
his
assistance
and
together
we
struggled
with
the
finny
monster
he
pulled
tremendously
and
lashed
the
water
around
him
but
we
held
the
cord
fast
and
he
had
no
chance
of
escape
weaker
and
weaker
grew
his
struggles
and
at
length
exhausted
by
his
exertions
and
loss
of
blood
he
allowed
us
to
draw
him
ashore
he
was
a
noble
prize
and
fritz
and
ernest
who
came
up
just
as
we
completed
his
capture
were
quite
envious
of
jack
success
not
to
be
behindhand
they
eagerly
rushed
off
for
weapons
themselves
we
were
soon
all
in
the
water
fritz
with
a
harpoon
ernest
with
a
rod
and
line
and
i
myself
armed
like
neptune
with
an
iron
trident
or
more
properly
speaking
perhaps
a
pitchfork
soon
the
shore
was
strewn
with
a
goodly
number
of
the
finest
fish
monster
after
monster
we
drew
to
land
at
length
fritz
after
harpooning
a
great
sturgeon
full
eight
feet
long
could
not
get
the
fish
ashore
we
all
went
to
his
assistance
but
our
united
efforts
were
unavailing
the
buffalo
proposed
my
wife
and
off
went
jack
for
storm
storm
was
harnessed
to
the
harpoon
rope
and
soon
the
monstrous
fish
lay
panting
on
the
sand
we
at
length
when
we
had
captured
as
many
fish
as
we
could
possibly
utilize
set
about
cleaning
and
preparing
their
flesh
some
we
salted
some
we
dried
like
the
herrings
some
we
treated
like
the
tunny
of
the
mediterranean
we
prepared
them
in
oil
of
the
roe
of
the
sturgeon
i
decided
to
form
caviare
the
great
russian
dish
i
removed
from
it
all
the
membranes
by
which
it
is
surrounded
washed
it
in
vinegar
salted
it
pressed
out
all
the
moisture
caused
by
the
properties
of
the
salt
packed
it
in
small
barrels
and
stowed
it
away
in
our
storehouse
i
knew
that
of
the
sturgeon
bladder
the
best
isinglass
is
made
so
carefully
collecting
the
air
bladders
from
all
those
we
had
killed
i
washed
them
and
hung
them
up
to
stiffen
the
outer
coat
or
membrane
i
then
peeled
off
cutting
the
remainder
into
strips
technically
called
staples
these
staples
i
placed
in
an
iron
pot
over
the
fire
and
when
they
had
been
reduced
to
a
proper
consistency
i
strained
off
the
glue
through
a
clean
cloth
and
spread
it
out
on
a
slab
of
stone
in
thin
layers
letting
them
remain
until
they
were
dry
the
substance
i
thus
obtained
was
beautifully
transparent
and
promised
to
serve
as
an
excellent
substitute
for
glass
in
our
fortunately
in
this
beautiful
climate
little
or
no
attention
was
necessary
to
the
kitchen
garden
the
seeds
sprang
up
and
flourished
without
apparently
the
slightest
regard
for
the
time
or
season
of
the
year
peas
beans
wheat
barley
rye
and
indian
corn
seemed
constantly
ripe
while
cucumbers
melons
and
all
sorts
of
other
vegetables
grew
luxuriantly
the
success
of
our
garden
at
tentholm
encouraged
me
to
hope
that
my
experiment
at
falconhurst
had
not
failed
and
one
morning
we
started
to
visit
the
spot
as
we
passed
by
the
field
from
which
the
potatoes
had
been
dug
we
found
it
covered
with
barley
wheat
rye
and
peas
in
profusion
i
turned
to
the
mother
in
amazement
where
has
this
fine
crop
sprung
from
said
i
from
the
earth
she
replied
laughing
where
franz
and
i
sowed
the
seed
i
brought
from
the
wreck
the
ground
was
ready
tilled
by
you
and
the
boys
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
scatter
the
seed
i
was
delighted
at
the
sight
and
it
augured
well
i
thought
for
the
success
of
my
maize
plantation
we
hurried
to
the
field
the
crop
had
indeed
grown
well
and
what
was
more
appeared
to
be
duly
appreciated
a
tremendous
flock
of
feathered
thieves
rose
as
we
approached
among
them
fritz
espied
a
few
ruffed
grouse
and
quick
as
thought
unhooding
his
eagle
he
started
him
off
in
chase
then
sprung
on
his
onager
and
followed
at
full
gallop
his
noble
bird
marked
out
the
finest
grouse
and
soaring
high
above
it
stooped
and
bore
his
prey
to
the
ground
fritz
was
close
at
hand
and
springing
through
the
bushes
he
saved
the
bird
from
death
hooded
the
eagle
eyes
and
returned
triumphantly
jack
had
not
stood
idle
for
slipping
his
pet
fangs
he
had
started
him
among
some
quails
who
remained
upon
the
field
and
to
my
surprise
the
jackal
secured
some
dozen
of
the
birds
bringing
them
faithfully
to
his
master
feet
we
then
turned
our
steps
toward
falconhurst
where
we
were
refreshed
by
a
most
delicious
drink
the
mother
prepared
for
us
the
stems
of
the
young
indian
corn
crushed
strained
and
mixed
with
water
and
the
juice
of
the
we
then
made
preparations
for
an
excursion
the
following
day
for
i
wished
to
establish
a
sort
of
farm
at
some
distance
from
falconhurst
where
we
might
place
some
of
our
animals
which
had
become
too
numerous
with
our
limited
means
to
supply
them
with
food
in
the
large
cart
to
which
we
harnessed
the
buffalo
cow
and
ass
we
placed
a
dozen
fowls
four
young
pigs
two
couple
of
sheep
and
as
many
goats
and
a
pair
of
hens
and
one
cock
grouse
fritz
led
the
way
on
his
onager
and
by
a
new
track
we
forced
a
passage
through
the
woods
and
tall
grasses
toward
cape
disappointment
the
difficult
march
was
at
length
over
and
we
emerged
from
the
forest
upon
a
large
plain
covered
with
curious
little
bushes
the
branches
of
these
little
shrubs
and
the
ground
about
them
were
covered
with
pure
white
flakes
snow
snow
exclaimed
franz
oh
mother
come
down
from
the
cart
and
play
snowballs
this
is
jolly
much
better
than
the
ugly
rain
i
was
not
surprised
at
the
boy
mistake
for
indeed
the
flakes
did
look
like
snow
but
before
i
could
express
my
opinion
fritz
declared
that
the
plant
must
be
a
kind
of
dwarf
cotton
tree
we
approached
nearer
and
found
he
was
right
soft
fine
wool
inclosed
in
pods
and
still
hanging
on
the
bushes
or
lying
on
the
ground
abounded
in
every
direction
we
had
indeed
discovered
this
valuable
plant
the
mother
was
charmed
and
gathering
a
great
quantity
in
three
capacious
bags
we
resumed
our
journey
crossing
the
cotton
field
we
ascended
a
pretty
wooded
hill
the
view
from
the
summit
was
glorious
luxuriant
grass
at
our
feet
stretching
down
the
hillside
dotted
here
and
there
with
shady
trees
among
which
gushed
down
a
sparkling
brook
while
below
lay
the
rich
green
forest
with
the
sea
beyond
what
better
situation
could
we
hope
to
find
for
our
new
farm
pasture
water
shade
and
shelter
all
were
here
we
pitched
our
tent
built
our
fireplace
and
leaving
the
mother
to
prepare
our
repast
fritz
and
i
selected
a
spot
for
the
erection
of
our
shed
we
soon
found
a
group
of
trees
so
situated
that
the
trunks
would
serve
as
posts
for
our
intended
building
thither
we
carried
all
our
tools
and
then
as
the
day
was
far
advanced
enjoyed
our
supper
and
lay
down
upon
most
comfortable
beds
which
the
mother
had
prepared
for
us
with
the
cotton
the
group
of
trees
we
had
selected
was
exactly
suited
to
our
purpose
for
it
formed
a
regular
rectilinear
figure
the
greatest
side
of
which
faced
the
sea
i
cut
deep
mortices
in
the
trunks
about
ten
feet
from
the
ground
and
again
ten
feet
higher
up
to
form
a
second
story
in
these
mortices
i
inserted
beams
thus
forming
a
framework
for
my
building
and
then
making
a
roof
of
laths
i
overlaid
it
with
bark
which
i
stripped
from
a
neighboring
tree
and
fixed
with
acacia
thorns
and
which
would
effectually
shoot
off
any
amount
of
rain
while
clearing
up
the
scraps
of
bark
and
other
rubbish
for
fuel
for
our
fire
i
noticed
a
peculiar
smell
and
stooping
down
i
picked
up
pieces
of
the
bark
some
of
which
to
my
great
surprise
i
found
was
that
of
the
terebinth
tree
and
the
rest
that
of
the
american
fir
the
goats
too
made
an
important
discovery
among
the
same
heap
for
we
found
them
busily
rooting
out
pieces
of
cinnamon
a
most
delicious
and
aromatic
spice
from
the
fir
said
i
to
the
boys
we
get
turpentine
and
tar
and
thus
it
is
that
the
fir
tree
becomes
such
a
valuable
article
of
commerce
so
we
may
look
forward
to
preparing
pitch
for
our
yacht
with
tar
and
oil
you
know
and
too
with
tar
and
fat
i
do
not
know
that
you
will
equally
appreciate
the
terebinth
tree
a
gum
issues
from
incisions
in
the
bark
which
hardens
in
the
sun
and
becomes
as
transparent
as
amber
when
burned
it
gives
forth
a
most
delicious
perfume
and
when
dissolved
in
spirits
of
wine
forms
a
beautiful
transparent
varnish
the
completion
of
our
new
farmhouse
occupied
us
several
days
we
wove
strong
lianas
and
other
creepers
together
to
form
the
walls
to
the
height
of
about
six
feet
the
rest
up
to
the
roof
we
formed
merely
of
a
of
laths
to
admit
both
air
and
light
within
we
divided
the
house
into
three
parts
one
subdivided
into
stalls
for
the
animals
a
second
fitted
with
perches
for
the
birds
and
a
third
simply
furnished
with
a
rough
table
and
benches
to
serve
as
a
sleeping
apartment
for
ourselves
when
we
should
find
it
necessary
to
pay
the
place
a
visit
in
a
short
time
the
dwelling
was
most
comfortably
arranged
and
as
we
daily
filled
the
feeding
troughs
with
the
food
the
animals
best
liked
they
showed
no
inclination
to
desert
the
spot
we
had
chosen
for
them
yet
hard
as
we
had
worked
we
found
that
the
provisions
we
had
brought
with
us
would
be
exhausted
before
we
could
hope
to
be
able
to
leave
the
farm
i
therefore
dispatched
jack
and
fritz
for
fresh
supplies
during
their
absence
ernest
and
i
made
a
short
excursion
in
the
neighborhood
that
we
might
know
more
exactly
the
character
of
the
country
near
our
farm
passing
over
a
brook
which
flowed
toward
the
wall
of
rocks
we
reached
a
large
marsh
and
as
we
walked
round
it
i
noticed
with
delight
that
it
was
covered
with
the
rice
plant
growing
wild
in
the
greatest
profusion
here
and
there
only
were
there
any
ripe
plants
and
from
these
rose
a
number
of
ruffed
grouse
at
which
both
ernest
and
i
let
fly
two
fell
and
fangs
who
was
with
us
brought
them
to
our
feet
as
we
advanced
knips
skipped
from
the
back
of
his
steed
juno
and
began
to
regale
himself
on
some
fruit
at
a
short
distance
off
we
followed
the
little
animal
and
found
him
devouring
delicious
strawberries
having
enjoyed
the
fruit
ourselves
we
filled
the
hamper
knips
always
carried
and
secured
the
fruit
from
his
pilfering
paws
with
leaves
fixed
firmly
down
i
then
took
a
sample
of
the
rice
seeds
to
show
the
mother
and
we
continued
our
journey
presently
we
reached
the
borders
of
the
pretty
lake
which
we
had
seen
beyond
the
swamp
the
nearer
aspect
of
its
calm
blue
waters
greatly
charmed
us
and
still
more
so
the
sight
of
numbers
of
black
swans
disporting
themselves
on
the
glassy
surface
in
which
their
stately
forms
and
graceful
movements
were
reflected
as
in
a
mirror
it
was
delightful
to
watch
these
splendid
birds
old
and
young
swimming
together
in
the
peaceful
enjoyment
of
life
seeking
their
food
and
pursuing
one
another
playfully
in
the
water
i
could
not
think
of
breaking
in
upon
their
happy
beautiful
existence
by
firing
among
them
but
our
dog
juno
was
by
no
means
so
considerate
for
all
at
once
i
heard
a
plunge
and
saw
her
drag
out
of
the
water
a
most
creature
something
like
a
small
otter
but
not
above
inches
in
length
which
she
would
have
torn
to
pieces
had
we
not
hurried
up
and
taken
it
from
her
this
curious
little
animal
was
of
a
soft
dark
brown
color
the
fur
being
of
a
lighter
shade
under
the
body
its
feet
were
furnished
with
large
claws
and
also
completely
webbed
the
head
small
with
deeply
set
eyes
and
ears
and
terminating
in
a
broad
flat
bill
like
that
of
a
duck
this
singularity
seemed
to
us
so
droll
that
we
both
laughed
heartily
feeling
at
the
same
time
much
puzzled
to
know
what
sort
of
animal
it
could
possibly
be
for
want
of
a
better
we
gave
it
the
name
of
the
beast
with
a
bill
and
ernest
willingly
undertook
to
carry
it
that
it
might
be
stuffed
and
kept
as
a
curiosity
after
this
we
returned
to
the
farm
thinking
our
messengers
might
soon
arrive
and
sure
enough
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
fritz
and
jack
made
their
appearance
at
a
brisk
trot
and
gave
a
circumstantial
account
of
their
mission
i
was
pleased
to
see
that
they
had
fulfilled
their
orders
intelligently
carrying
out
my
intentions
in
the
spirit
and
not
blindly
to
the
letter
next
morning
we
quitted
the
farm
which
we
named
woodlands
after
providing
amply
for
the
wants
of
the
animals
sheep
goats
and
poultry
which
we
left
there
shortly
afterward
on
entering
a
wood
we
found
it
tenanted
by
an
enormous
number
of
apes
who
instantly
assailed
us
with
showers
of
uttering
hideous
and
angry
cries
and
effectually
checking
our
progress
until
we
put
them
to
flight
by
a
couple
of
shots
which
not
a
little
astonished
their
weak
minds
fritz
picked
up
some
of
their
missiles
and
showing
them
to
me
i
recognized
the
cone
of
the
by
all
means
gather
some
of
these
cones
boys
said
i
you
will
find
the
kernel
has
a
pleasant
taste
like
almonds
and
from
it
we
can
by
pressing
obtain
an
excellent
oil
therefore
i
should
like
to
carry
some
home
with
us
a
hill
which
seemed
to
promise
a
good
view
from
its
summit
next
attracted
my
notice
and
on
climbing
it
we
were
more
than
repaid
for
the
exertion
by
the
extensive
and
beautiful
prospect
which
lay
spread
before
our
eyes
the
situation
altogether
was
so
agreeable
that
here
also
i
resolved
to
make
a
settlement
to
be
visited
occasionally
and
after
resting
awhile
and
talking
the
matter
over
we
set
to
work
to
build
a
cottage
such
as
we
had
lately
finished
at
woodlands
our
experience
there
enabled
us
to
proceed
quickly
with
the
work
and
in
a
few
days
the
rustic
abode
was
completed
and
received
by
choice
the
grand
name
of
prospect
hill
my
chief
object
in
undertaking
this
expedition
had
been
to
discover
some
tree
from
whose
bark
i
could
hope
to
make
a
useful
light
boat
or
canoe
hitherto
i
had
met
with
none
at
all
fit
for
my
purpose
but
not
despairing
of
success
i
began
when
the
cottage
was
built
to
examine
carefully
the
surrounding
woods
and
after
considerable
trouble
came
upon
two
magnificent
tall
straight
trees
the
bark
of
which
seemed
something
like
that
of
the
birch
selecting
one
whose
trunk
was
to
a
great
height
free
from
branches
we
attached
to
one
of
the
lower
of
the
boughs
the
rope
ladder
we
had
with
us
and
fritz
ascending
it
cut
the
bark
through
in
a
circle
i
did
the
same
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
and
then
from
between
the
circle
we
took
a
narrow
perpendicular
slip
of
bark
entirely
out
so
that
we
could
introduce
the
proper
tools
by
which
gradually
to
loosen
and
raise
the
main
part
so
as
finally
to
separate
it
from
the
tree
uninjured
and
entire
this
we
found
possible
because
the
bark
was
moist
and
flexible
great
care
and
exertion
was
necessary
as
the
bark
became
detached
to
support
it
until
the
whole
was
ready
to
be
let
gently
down
upon
the
grass
this
seemed
a
great
achievement
but
our
work
was
by
no
means
ended
nor
could
we
venture
to
desist
from
it
until
while
the
material
was
soft
and
pliable
we
had
formed
it
into
the
shape
we
desired
for
the
canoe
in
order
to
do
this
i
cut
a
long
triangular
piece
out
of
each
end
of
the
roll
and
placing
the
sloping
parts
one
over
the
other
i
drew
the
ends
into
a
pointed
form
and
secured
them
with
pegs
and
glue
this
successful
proceeding
had
however
widened
the
boat
and
made
it
too
flat
in
the
middle
so
that
it
was
necessary
to
put
ropes
round
it
and
tighten
them
until
the
proper
shape
was
restored
before
we
could
allow
it
to
dry
in
the
sun
this
being
all
i
could
do
without
a
greater
variety
of
tools
i
determined
to
complete
my
work
in
a
more
convenient
situation
and
forthwith
dispatched
fritz
and
jack
with
orders
to
bring
the
sledge
which
now
ran
on
wheels
taken
from
that
the
canoe
might
be
transported
direct
to
the
vicinity
of
the
harbor
at
tentholm
during
their
absence
i
fortunately
found
some
wood
naturally
curved
just
suited
for
ribs
to
support
and
strengthen
the
sides
of
the
boat
when
the
two
lads
returned
with
the
sledge
it
was
time
to
rest
for
the
night
but
with
early
dawn
we
were
again
busily
at
work
the
sledge
was
loaded
with
the
new
boat
and
everything
else
we
could
pack
into
it
and
we
turned
our
steps
homeward
finding
the
greatest
difficulty
however
in
getting
our
vehicle
through
the
woods
we
crossed
the
bamboo
swamp
where
i
cut
a
fine
mast
for
my
boat
and
came
at
length
to
a
small
opening
or
defile
in
the
ridge
of
rocks
where
a
little
torrent
rushed
from
its
source
down
into
the
larger
stream
beyond
here
we
determined
to
make
a
halt
in
order
to
erect
a
great
earth
wall
across
the
narrow
gorge
which
being
thickly
planted
with
prickly
pear
indian
fig
and
every
thorny
bush
we
could
find
would
in
time
form
an
effectual
barrier
against
the
intrusion
of
wild
beasts
the
cliffs
being
to
the
best
of
our
belief
in
every
other
part
inaccessible
for
our
own
convenience
we
retained
a
small
through
this
barrier
concealing
and
defending
it
with
piles
of
branches
and
thorns
and
also
we
contrived
a
light
drawbridge
over
the
stream
so
that
we
rendered
the
pass
altogether
a
very
strong
position
should
we
ever
have
to
act
on
the
defensive
this
work
occupied
two
days
and
continuing
on
our
way
we
were
glad
to
rest
at
falconhurst
before
arriving
quite
tired
and
worn
out
at
tentholm
it
took
some
time
to
recruit
our
strength
after
this
long
and
fatiguing
expedition
and
then
we
vigorously
resumed
the
task
of
finishing
the
canoe
the
arrangements
i
flattered
myself
were
carried
out
in
a
manner
quite
worthy
of
a
ship
builder
a
mast
sails
and
paddles
were
fitted
but
my
final
touch
although
i
prized
it
highly
and
considered
it
a
grand
and
original
idea
would
no
doubt
have
excited
only
ridicule
and
contempt
had
it
been
seen
by
a
naval
man
my
contrivance
was
this
i
had
a
couple
of
large
bags
made
of
the
skins
of
the
well
tarred
and
pitched
inflated
and
made
fast
on
each
side
of
the
boat
just
above
the
level
of
the
water
these
floats
however
much
she
might
be
loaded
would
effectually
prevent
either
the
sinking
or
capsizing
of
my
craft
i
may
as
well
relate
in
this
place
what
i
omitted
at
the
time
of
its
occurrence
during
the
rainy
season
our
cow
presented
us
with
a
and
that
there
might
never
be
any
difficulty
in
managing
him
i
at
a
very
early
age
pierced
his
nose
and
placed
a
short
stick
in
it
to
be
exchanged
for
a
ring
when
he
was
old
enough
the
question
now
came
to
be
who
should
be
his
master
and
to
what
should
we
train
him
why
not
teach
him
said
fritz
to
fight
the
wild
animals
and
defend
us
like
the
fighting
bulls
of
the
hottentots
that
would
be
really
useful
i
am
sure
i
should
much
prefer
a
gentle
bull
to
a
fighting
one
exclaimed
his
mother
but
do
you
mean
to
say
tame
oxen
can
be
taught
to
act
rationally
on
the
defensive
i
can
but
repeat
what
i
have
heard
or
read
replied
i
as
regards
the
race
of
hottentots
who
inhabit
the
south
of
africa
among
all
sorts
of
wild
and
ferocious
animals
the
wealth
of
these
people
consists
solely
in
their
flocks
and
herds
and
for
their
protection
they
train
their
bulls
to
act
as
guards
these
courageous
animals
keep
the
rest
from
straying
away
and
when
danger
threatens
they
give
instant
notice
of
it
drive
the
herd
together
in
a
mass
the
calves
and
young
cows
being
placed
in
the
center
around
them
the
bulls
and
strong
oxen
make
a
formidable
circle
with
their
horned
heads
turned
to
the
front
offering
determined
resistance
to
the
fiercest
foe
these
fighting
bulls
will
even
sometimes
rush
with
dreadful
bellowing
to
meet
the
enemy
and
should
it
be
a
mighty
lion
or
other
strong
and
daring
monster
sacrifice
their
own
lives
in
defense
of
the
herd
it
is
said
that
formerly
when
hottentot
tribes
made
war
on
one
another
it
was
not
unusual
to
place
a
troop
of
these
warriors
in
the
van
of
the
little
army
when
their
heroism
led
to
decisive
victory
on
one
side
or
the
other
but
continued
i
although
i
can
see
you
are
all
delighted
with
my
description
of
these
fine
warlike
animals
i
think
we
had
better
train
this
youngster
to
be
a
peaceable
bull
who
is
to
have
charge
of
him
ernest
thought
it
would
be
more
amusing
to
train
his
monkey
than
a
calf
jack
with
the
buffalo
and
his
hunting
jackal
had
quite
enough
on
his
hands
fritz
was
content
with
the
onager
their
mother
was
voted
mistress
of
the
old
gray
donkey
and
i
myself
being
of
the
whole
establishment
of
animals
there
remained
only
little
franz
to
whose
special
care
the
calf
could
be
committed
what
say
you
my
boy
will
you
undertake
to
look
after
this
little
fellow
oh
yes
father
he
replied
once
you
told
me
about
a
strong
man
i
think
his
name
was
milo
and
he
had
a
tiny
calf
and
he
used
to
carry
it
about
everywhere
it
grew
bigger
and
bigger
but
still
he
carried
it
often
till
at
last
he
grew
so
strong
that
when
it
was
quite
a
great
big
ox
he
could
lift
it
as
easily
as
ever
and
so
you
see
if
i
take
care
of
our
wee
calf
and
teach
it
to
do
what
i
like
perhaps
when
it
grows
big
i
shall
still
be
able
to
manage
it
and
then
oh
papa
do
you
think
i
might
ride
upon
it
i
smiled
at
the
child
simplicity
and
his
funny
application
of
the
story
of
milo
of
crotona
the
calf
shall
be
yours
my
boy
make
him
as
tame
as
you
can
and
we
will
see
about
letting
you
mount
him
some
day
but
remember
he
will
be
a
great
bull
long
before
you
are
nearly
a
man
now
what
will
you
call
him
shall
i
call
him
grumble
father
hear
what
a
low
muttering
noise
he
makes
grumble
will
do
famously
grumble
grumble
oh
it
beats
your
buffalo
name
hollow
jack
not
a
bit
said
he
why
you
ca
compare
the
two
names
fancy
mother
saying
comes
franz
on
grumble
but
jack
riding
on
the
storm
oh
it
sounds
sublime
we
named
the
two
puppies
bruno
and
fawn
and
so
ended
this
important
domestic
business
for
two
months
we
worked
steadily
at
our
in
order
to
complete
the
necessary
arrangement
of
partition
walls
so
as
to
put
the
rooms
and
stalls
for
the
animals
in
comfortable
order
for
the
next
long
rainy
season
during
which
time
when
other
work
would
be
at
a
standstill
we
could
carry
on
many
minor
details
for
the
improvement
of
the
abode
we
leveled
the
floors
first
with
clay
then
spread
gravel
mixed
with
melted
gypsum
over
that
producing
a
smooth
hard
surface
which
did
very
well
for
most
of
the
apartments
but
i
was
ambitious
of
having
one
or
two
carpets
and
set
about
making
a
kind
of
felt
in
the
following
way
i
spread
out
a
large
piece
of
sailcloth
and
covered
it
equally
all
over
with
a
strong
liquid
made
of
glue
and
isinglass
which
saturated
it
thoroughly
on
it
we
then
laid
wool
and
hair
from
the
sheep
and
goats
which
had
been
carefully
cleaned
and
prepared
and
rolled
and
beat
it
until
it
adhered
tolerably
smoothly
to
the
cloth
finally
it
became
when
perfectly
dry
a
covering
for
the
floor
of
our
sitting
room
by
no
means
to
be
despised
one
morning
just
after
these
labors
at
the
were
completed
happening
to
awake
unusually
early
i
turned
my
thoughts
as
i
lay
waiting
for
sunrise
to
considering
what
length
of
time
we
had
now
passed
on
this
coast
and
discovered
to
my
surprise
that
the
very
next
day
would
be
the
anniversary
of
our
escape
from
the
wreck
my
heart
swelled
with
gratitude
to
the
gracious
god
who
had
then
granted
us
deliverance
and
ever
since
had
loaded
us
with
benefits
and
i
resolved
to
set
apart
as
a
day
of
thanksgiving
in
joyful
celebration
of
the
occasion
my
mind
was
full
of
indefinite
plans
when
i
rose
and
the
day
work
began
as
usual
i
took
care
that
everything
should
be
cleaned
cleared
and
set
in
order
both
outside
and
inside
our
dwelling
none
however
suspecting
that
there
was
any
particular
object
in
view
other
more
private
preparations
i
also
made
for
the
next
day
at
supper
i
made
the
coming
event
known
to
the
assembled
family
good
people
do
you
know
that
is
a
very
great
and
important
day
we
shall
have
to
keep
it
in
honor
of
our
merciful
escape
to
this
land
and
call
it
everyone
was
surprised
to
hear
that
we
had
already
been
twelve
months
in
the
country
indeed
my
wife
believed
i
might
be
mistaken
until
i
showed
her
how
i
had
calculated
regularly
ever
since
the
of
january
on
which
day
we
were
wrecked
by
marking
off
in
my
almanac
the
sundays
as
they
arrived
for
the
remaining
eleven
months
of
that
year
since
then
i
added
i
have
counted
days
this
is
the
of
february
we
landed
on
the
therefore
is
the
anniversary
of
the
day
of
our
escape
as
my
bookseller
has
not
sent
me
an
almanac
for
the
present
year
we
must
henceforth
reckon
for
ourselves
oh
that
will
be
good
fun
for
us
said
ernest
we
must
have
a
long
stick
like
robinson
crusoe
and
cut
a
notch
in
it
every
day
and
count
them
up
every
now
and
then
to
see
how
the
weeks
and
months
and
years
go
by
that
is
all
very
well
if
you
know
for
certain
the
number
of
days
in
each
month
and
in
the
year
what
do
you
say
ernest
the
year
contains
days
hours
minutes
and
seconds
returned
he
promptly
perfectly
correct
said
i
smiling
but
you
would
get
in
a
mess
with
those
spare
hours
minutes
and
seconds
in
a
year
or
two
would
you
not
at
all
every
four
years
i
would
add
them
all
together
make
a
day
stick
it
into
february
and
call
that
year
leap
year
well
done
professor
ernest
we
must
elect
you
astronomer
royal
in
this
our
kingdom
and
let
you
superintend
and
regulate
everything
connected
with
the
lapse
of
time
clocks
and
watches
included
before
they
went
to
sleep
i
could
hear
my
boys
whispering
among
themselves
about
father
mysterious
allusions
to
next
day
festival
and
rejoicings
but
i
offered
no
explanations
and
went
to
sleep
little
guessing
that
the
rogues
had
laid
a
far
more
surprising
than
my
simple
plan
for
their
diversion
nothing
less
than
roar
of
artillery
startled
me
from
sleep
at
daybreak
next
morning
i
sprang
up
and
found
my
wife
as
much
alarmed
as
i
was
by
the
noise
otherwise
i
should
have
been
inclined
to
believe
it
fancy
fritz
dress
quickly
and
come
with
me
cried
i
turning
to
his
hammock
lo
it
was
empty
neither
he
nor
jack
were
to
be
seen
altogether
bewildered
i
was
hastily
dressing
when
their
voices
were
heard
and
they
rushed
in
shouting
hurrah
did
we
rouse
you
with
a
right
good
thundering
salute
but
perceiving
at
a
glance
that
we
had
been
seriously
alarmed
fritz
hastened
to
apologize
for
the
thoughtless
way
in
which
they
had
sought
to
do
honor
to
the
day
of
thanksgiving
without
considering
that
an
unexpected
would
startle
us
unpleasantly
from
our
slumbers
we
readily
forgave
the
authors
of
our
alarm
in
consideration
of
the
good
intention
which
had
prompted
the
deed
and
satisfied
that
the
day
had
at
least
been
duly
inaugurated
we
all
went
quietly
to
breakfast
afterward
we
sat
together
for
a
long
time
enjoying
the
calm
beauty
of
the
morning
and
talking
of
all
that
had
taken
place
on
the
memorable
days
of
the
storm
a
year
ago
for
i
desired
that
the
awful
events
of
that
time
should
live
in
the
remembrance
of
my
children
with
a
deepening
sense
of
gratitude
for
our
deliverance
therefore
i
read
aloud
passages
from
my
journal
as
well
as
many
beautiful
verses
from
the
psalms
expressive
of
joyful
praise
and
thanksgiving
so
that
even
the
youngest
among
us
was
impressed
and
solemnized
at
the
recollections
of
escape
from
a
terrible
death
and
also
led
to
bless
and
praise
the
name
of
the
lord
our
deliverer
dinner
followed
shortly
after
this
happy
service
and
i
then
announced
for
the
afternoon
a
grand
display
of
athletic
sports
in
which
i
and
my
wife
were
to
be
spectators
and
judges
father
what
a
grand
idea
oh
how
jolly
are
we
to
run
races
and
prizes
will
there
be
prizes
father
the
judges
offer
prizes
for
competition
in
every
sort
of
manly
exercise
replied
i
shooting

riding
leaping

swimming
we
will
have
an
exhibition
of
your
skill
in
all
now
for
it
trumpeters
sound
for
the
opening
of
the
lists
uttering
these
last
words
in
a
stentorian
voice
and
wildly
waving
my
arms
toward
a
shady
spot
where
the
ducks
and
geese
were
quietly
resting
had
the
absurd
effect
i
intended
up
they
all
started
in
a
fright
gabbling
and
quacking
loudly
to
the
infinite
amusement
of
the
children
who
began
to
bustle
about
in
eager
preparations
for
the
contest
and
begging
to
know
with
what
they
were
to
begin
let
us
have
shooting
first
and
the
rest
when
the
heat
of
the
day
declines
here
is
a
mark
i
have
got
ready
for
you
said
i
producing
a
board
roughly
shaped
like
a
kangaroo
and
of
about
the
size
of
one
this
target
was
admired
but
jack
could
not
rest
satisfied
till
he
had
added
ears
and
a
long
leather
strap
for
a
tail
it
was
then
fixed
in
the
attitude
most
characteristic
of
the
creature
and
the
distance
for
firing
measured
off
each
of
the
three
competitors
was
to
fire
twice
fritz
hit
the
kangaroo
head
each
time
ernest
hit
the
body
once
and
jack
by
a
lucky
chance
shot
the
ears
clean
away
from
the
head
which
feat
raised
a
shout
of
laughter
a
second
trial
with
pistols
ensued
in
which
fritz
again
came
off
victor
then
desiring
the
competitors
to
load
with
small
shot
i
threw
a
little
board
as
high
as
i
possibly
could
up
in
the
air
each
in
turn
aiming
at
and
endeavoring
to
hit
it
before
it
touched
the
ground
in
this
i
found
to
my
surprise
that
the
sedate
ernest
succeeded
quite
as
well
as
his
more
impetuous
brother
fritz
as
for
jack
his
flying
board
escaped
wholly
uninjured
after
this
followed
archery
which
i
liked
to
encourage
foreseeing
that
a
time
might
come
when
ammunition
would
fail
and
in
this
practice
i
saw
with
pleasure
that
my
elder
sons
were
really
skillful
while
even
little
franz
acquitted
himself
well
a
pause
ensued
and
then
i
started
a
running
match
fritz
ernest
and
jack
were
to
run
to
falconhurst
by
the
most
direct
path
the
first
to
reach
the
tree
was
to
bring
me
in
proof
of
his
success
a
penknife
i
had
accidentally
left
on
the
table
in
my
sleeping
room
at
a
given
signal
away
went
the
racers
in
fine
style
fritz
and
jack
putting
forth
all
their
powers
took
the
lead
at
once
running
in
advance
of
ernest
who
started
at
a
good
steady
pace
which
i
predicted
he
would
be
better
able
to
maintain
than
such
a
furious
rate
as
his
brothers
but
long
before
we
expected
to
see
them
back
a
tremendous
noise
of
galloping
caused
us
to
look
with
surprise
toward
the
bridge
and
jack
made
his
appearance
thundering
along
on
his
buffalo
with
the
onager
and
the
donkey
tearing
after
him
riderless
and
the
whole
party
in
the
wildest
spirits
hullo
cried
i
what
sort
of
footrace
do
you
call
this
master
jack
he
shouted
merrily
as
he
dashed
up
to
us
then
flinging
himself
off
and
saluting
us
in
a
playful
way
i
very
soon
saw
said
he
that
i
had
a
chance
so
renouncing
all
idea
of
the
prize
i
caught
storm
and
made
him
gallop
home
with
me
to
be
in
time
to
see
the
others
come
puffing
in
lightfoot
and
old
grizzle
chose
to
join
me
i
never
invited
them
by
and
by
the
other
boys
arrived
ernest
holding
up
the
knife
in
token
of
being
the
winner
and
after
hearing
all
particulars
about
the
running
and
that
he
had
reached
falconhurst
two
minutes
before
fritz
we
proceeded
to
test
the
climbing
powers
of
the
youthful
athletes
in
this
exercise
jack
performed
wonders
he
ascended
with
remarkable
agility
the
highest
palms
whose
stems
he
could
clasp
and
when
he
put
on
the
buskins
which
enabled
him
to
take
firm
hold
of
larger
trees
he
played
antics
like
a
squirrel
or
a
monkey
peeping
and
grinning
at
us
at
first
on
one
side
of
the
stem
and
then
on
the
other
in
a
most
diverting
way
fritz
and
ernest
climbed
well
but
could
not
come
near
the
grace
and
skill
of
their
active
and
lively
young
brother
riding
followed
and
marvelous
feats
were
performed
fritz
and
jack
proving
themselves
very
equal
in
their
management
of
their
different
steeds
i
thought
the
riding
was
over
when
little
franz
appeared
from
the
stable
in
the
cave
leading
young
grumble
the
by
a
bridle
passed
through
his
nose
ring
the
child
saluted
us
with
a
pretty
little
air
of
confidence
exclaiming
now
most
learned
judges
prepare
to
see
something
quite
new
and
wonderful
the
great
milo
of
crotona
desires
the
honor
of
exhibiting
before
you
then
taking
a
whip
and
holding
the
end
of
a
long
cord
he
made
the
animal
at
the
word
of
command
walk
trot
and
gallop
in
a
circle
round
him
he
afterward
mounted
and
showed
off
grumble
somewhat
awkward
paces
the
sports
were
concluded
by
swimming
matches
and
the
competitors
found
a
plunge
in
salt
water
very
refreshing
after
their
varied
exertions
fritz
showed
himself
a
master
in
the
art
at
home
in
the
element
no
movement
betokened
either
exertion
or
weariness
ernest
exhibited
too
much
anxiety
and
effort
while
jack
was
far
too
violent
and
hasty
and
soon
became
exhausted
franz
gave
token
of
future
skill
by
this
time
as
it
was
getting
late
we
returned
to
our
dwelling
the
mother
having
preceded
us
in
order
to
make
arrangements
for
the
ceremony
of
we
found
her
seated
in
great
state
with
the
prizes
set
out
by
her
side
the
boys
marched
in
pretending
to
play
various
instruments
in
imitation
of
a
band
and
then
all
four
bowing
respectfully
stood
before
her
like
the
victors
in
a
tournament
of
old
awaiting
the
reward
of
valor
from
the
queen
of
beauty
which
she
bestowed
with
a
few
words
of
praise
and
encouragement
fritz
to
his
immense
delight
received
as
the
prize
for
shooting
and
swimming
a
splendid
rifle
and
a
beautiful
to
ernest
as
winner
of
the
running
match
was
given
a
handsome
gold
watch
for
climbing
and
riding
jack
had
a
pair
of
silver
plated
spurs
and
a
riding
whip
both
of
which
gave
him
extraordinary
pleasure
franz
received
a
pair
of
stirrups
and
a
driving
whip
made
of
rhinoceros
hide
which
we
thought
would
be
of
use
to
him
in
the
character
of
when
the
ceremony
was
supposed
to
be
over
i
advanced
and
solemnly
presented
to
my
wife
a
lovely
filled
with
every
imaginable
requirement
for
a
lady
which
she
accepted
with
equal
surprise
and
delight
the
whole
entertainment
afforded
the
boys
such
intense
pleasure
and
their
spirits
rose
to
such
a
pitch
that
nothing
would
serve
them
but
another
salvo
of
artillery
in
order
to
close
with
befitting
dignity
and
honor
so
great
a
day
they
gave
me
no
peace
till
they
had
leave
to
squander
some
gunpowder
and
then
at
last
their
excited
feelings
seeming
relieved
we
were
able
to
sit
down
to
supper
shortly
afterward
we
joined
in
family
worship
and
retired
to
rest
soon
after
the
great
festival
of
our
grand
i
recollected
that
it
was
now
the
time
when
the
figs
at
falconhurst
being
ripe
immense
flocks
of
ortolans
and
wild
pigeons
were
attracted
thither
and
as
we
had
found
those
preserved
last
year
of
the
greatest
use
among
our
stores
of
winter
provisions
i
would
not
miss
the
opportunity
of
renewing
our
stock
and
therefore
laying
aside
the
building
work
we
removed
with
all
speed
to
our
home
in
the
tree
where
sure
enough
we
found
the
first
detachment
of
the
birds
already
busy
with
the
fruit
in
order
to
spare
ammunition
i
resolved
to
concoct
a
strong
sort
of
birdlime
of
which
i
had
read
in
some
account
of
the
palm
islanders
who
make
it
of
fresh
caoutchouc
mixed
with
oil
and
of
so
good
a
quality
that
it
has
been
known
to
catch
even
peacocks
and
turkeys
fritz
and
jack
were
therefore
dispatched
to
collect
some
fresh
caoutchouc
from
the
trees
and
as
this
involved
a
good
gallop
on
storm
and
lightfoot
they
nothing
loth
set
off
they
took
a
supply
of
calabashes
in
which
to
bring
the
gum
and
we
found
it
high
time
to
manufacture
a
fresh
stock
of
these
useful
vessels
i
was
beginning
to
propose
an
expedition
to
the
wood
regretting
the
time
it
would
take
to
go
such
a
distance
when
my
wife
reminded
me
of
her
plantation
near
the
potato
field
there
to
our
joy
we
found
that
all
the
plants
were
flourishing
and
crops
of
gourds
and
pumpkins
in
all
stages
of
ripeness
covered
the
ground
selecting
a
great
number
suited
to
our
purpose
we
hastened
home
and
began
the
manufacture
of
basins
dishes
plates
flasks
and
spoons
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
with
even
greater
success
than
before
when
the
riders
returned
with
the
caoutchouc
they
brought
several
novelties
besides
a
crane
for
example
shot
by
fritz
and
an
animal
which
they
called
a
marmot
but
which
to
me
seemed
much
more
like
a
badger
aniseed
turpentine
and
wax
berries
for
candles
they
had
also
collected
and
a
curious
root
which
they
introduced
by
the
name
of
the
monkey
plant
and
pray
wherefore
plant
may
i
ask
well
for
this
reason
father
answered
fritz
we
came
upon
an
open
space
in
the
forest
near
woodlands
and
perceived
a
troop
of
monkeys
apparently
engaged
as
jack
said
in
cultivating
the
soil
being
curious
to
make
out
what
they
were
at
we
tied
up
the
dogs
as
well
as
storm
and
lightfoot
and
crept
near
enough
to
see
that
the
apes
were
most
industriously
grubbing
up
and
eating
roots
this
they
did
in
a
way
that
nearly
choked
us
with
laughter
for
when
the
root
was
rather
hard
to
pull
up
and
the
leaves
were
torn
off
they
seized
it
firmly
in
their
teeth
and
flung
themselves
fairly
in
the
most
ludicrous
fashion
you
ever
saw
and
up
came
the
root
unable
to
resist
the
leverage
of
course
we
wanted
to
see
what
this
dainty
morsel
was
like
so
we
loosed
the
dogs
and
the
apes
cleared
out
double
quick
leaving
plenty
of
the
roots
about
we
tasted
them
and
thought
them
very
nice
will
you
try
one
the
plant
was
quite
new
to
me
but
i
imagined
it
might
be
what
is
called
in
china
ginseng
and
there
prized
and
valued
beyond
everything
the
children
being
curious
to
hear
more
about
this
ginseng
i
continued
in
china
it
is
considered
so
strengthening
and
wholesome
that
it
is
used
as
a
sort
of
universal
medicine
being
supposed
to
prolong
human
life
the
emperor
alone
has
the
right
to
permit
it
to
be
gathered
and
guards
are
placed
round
land
where
it
grows
ginseng
is
to
be
found
in
tartary
and
has
lately
been
discovered
in
canada
it
is
cultivated
in
pennsylvania
because
the
americans
introduce
it
secretly
into
china
as
smuggled
merchandise
fritz
then
continued
after
this
we
went
on
to
woodlands
but
mercy
on
us
what
a
confusion
the
place
was
in
everything
smashed
or
torn
and
covered
with
mud
and
dirt
the
fowls
terrified
the
sheep
and
goats
scattered
the
contents
of
the
rooms
dashed
about
as
if
a
whirlwind
had
swept
through
the
house
what
i
exclaimed
while
my
wife
looked
horrified
at
the
news
conjuring
up
in
her
imagination
hordes
of
savages
who
would
soon
come
and
lay
waste
falconhurst
and
tentholm
as
well
as
woodlands
how
can
that
have
happened
did
you
discover
the
authors
of
all
this
mischief
oh
said
jack
it
was
easy
to
see
that
those
dreadful
monkeys
had
done
it
all
first
they
must
have
got
into
the
yards
and
sheds
and
hunted
the
fowls
and
creatures
about
and
then
i
dare
say
the
cunning
rascals
put
a
little
monkey
in
at
some
small
opening
and
bid
him
unfasten
the
shutters
you
know
what
nimble
fingers
they
have
then
of
course
the
whole
posse
of
them
swarmed
into
our
nice
tidy
cottage
and
skylarked
with
every
single
thing
they
could
lay
paws
on
till
perhaps
they
got
hungry
all
at
once
and
bethought
them
of
the
as
you
call
it
out
in
the
woods
yonder
where
we
found
them
so
busy
refreshing
themselves
the
mischievous
villains
while
we
were
gazing
at
all
this
ruin
in
a
sort
of
bewilderment
pursued
fritz
we
heard
a
sound
of
rushing
wings
and
strange
ringing
cries
as
of
multitudes
of
birds
passing
high
above
us
and
looking
up
we
perceived
them
flying
quickly
in
a
flock
at
a
great
height
in
the
air
they
began
gradually
to
descend
taking
the
direction
of
the
lake
and
separated
into
a
number
of
small
detachments
which
followed
in
a
long
straight
line
and
at
a
slower
rate
the
movements
of
the
leaders
who
appeared
to
be
examining
the
neighborhood
we
could
now
see
what
large
birds
they
must
be
but
dared
not
show
ourselves
or
follow
them
lest
they
should
take
alarm
presently
and
with
one
accord
they
quickened
their
motion
just
as
if
the
band
had
begun
to
play
a
quick
march
after
a
slow
one
and
rapidly
descended
to
earth
in
a
variety
of
lively
ways
and
near
enough
for
us
to
see
that
they
must
be
cranes
some
alighted
at
once
while
others
hovered
sportively
over
them
many
darted
to
the
ground
and
just
touching
it
would
soar
again
upward
with
a
strong
but
somewhat
heavy
flight
after
gamboling
in
this
way
for
a
time
the
whole
multitude
as
though
at
the
word
of
command
alighted
on
the
rice
fields
and
began
to
feast
on
the
fresh
grain
we
thought
now
was
our
time
to
get
a
shot
at
the
cranes
and
cautiously
approached
but
they
were
too
cunning
to
let
themselves
be
surprised
and
we
came
unexpectedly
upon
their
or
sentinels
who
instantly
sprang
into
the
air
uttering
loud
cries
upon
which
the
whole
flock
arose
and
followed
them
with
a
rush
like
a
sudden
squall
of
wind
we
were
quite
startled
and
it
was
useless
to
attempt
a
shot
but
unwilling
to
miss
the
chance
of
securing
at
least
one
of
the
birds
i
hastily
unhooded
my
eagle
and
threw
him
into
the
air
with
a
piercing
cry
he
soared
away
high
above
them
then
shot
downward
like
an
arrow
causing
wild
confusion
among
the
cranes
the
one
which
the
eagle
attacked
sought
to
defend
itself
a
struggle
followed
and
they
came
together
to
the
ground
not
far
from
where
we
stood
hastening
forward
to
my
grief
i
found
the
beautiful
crane
already
dead
the
eagle
luckily
unhurt
was
rewarded
with
a
small
pigeon
from
my
gamebag
after
this
we
went
back
to
woodlands
got
some
turpentine
and
a
bag
of
rice
and
set
off
for
home
fritz
interesting
story
being
ended
and
supper
ready
we
made
trial
of
the
new
roots
and
found
them
very
palatable
either
boiled
or
stewed
the
monkey
plant
however
if
it
really
proved
to
be
the
ginseng
of
the
chinese
would
require
to
be
used
with
caution
being
of
an
aromatic
and
heating
nature
we
resolved
to
transplant
a
supply
of
both
roots
to
our
kitchen
garden
chapter
x
the
war
with
the
apes
our
home
in
the
salt
palace
on
the
following
morning
we
were
early
astir
and
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
we
went
regularly
to
work
with
the
birdlime
the
tough
adhesive
mixture
of
caoutchouc
oil
and
turpentine
turned
out
well
the
boys
brought
rods
which
i
smeared
over
and
made
them
place
among
the
upper
branches
where
the
fruit
was
plentiful
and
the
birds
most
congregated
the
prodigious
number
of
the
pigeons
far
beyond
those
of
last
year
reminded
me
that
we
had
not
then
as
now
witnessed
their
arrival
at
their
but
had
seen
only
the
last
body
of
the
season
a
mere
party
of
stragglers
compared
to
the
masses
which
now
weighed
down
the
branches
of
all
the
trees
in
the
neighborhood
the
sweet
acorns
of
the
evergreen
oaks
were
also
patronized
large
flocks
were
there
congregated
and
from
the
state
of
the
ground
under
the
trees
it
was
evident
that
at
night
they
roosted
on
the
branches
seeing
this
i
determined
to
make
a
raid
upon
them
by
torchlight
after
the
manner
of
the
colonists
in
virginia
meantime
the
birdlime
acted
well
the
pigeons
alighting
stuck
fast
the
more
they
fluttered
and
struggled
the
more
completely
were
they
bedaubed
with
the
tenacious
mixture
and
at
length
with
piteous
cries
fell
to
the
ground
bearing
the
sticks
with
them
the
birds
were
then
removed
fresh
lime
spread
and
the
snare
set
again
the
boys
quickly
became
able
to
carry
on
the
work
without
my
assistance
so
leaving
it
to
them
i
went
to
prepare
torches
with
pine
wood
and
turpentine
for
the
night
attack
jack
presently
brought
a
very
pretty
pigeon
unlike
the
rest
to
show
me
as
he
felt
unwilling
to
kill
it
and
seeing
that
it
must
be
one
of
our
own
european
breed
which
we
wished
to
preserve
until
their
numbers
greatly
increased
i
took
the
trembling
captive
and
gently
cleansed
its
feet
and
wings
with
oil
and
ashes
from
the
stiff
sticky
mess
with
which
it
was
bedaubed
placing
it
then
in
a
wicker
cage
and
telling
jack
to
bring
me
any
others
like
it
which
were
caught
this
he
did
and
we
secured
several
pairs
greatly
to
my
satisfaction
as
having
necessarily
let
them
go
free
when
we
landed
they
had
become
quite
wild
and
we
derived
no
advantage
from
them
whereas
now
we
would
have
a
cot
and
whenever
we
liked
when
evening
drew
on
we
set
out
for
the
wood
of
sweet
acorns
provided
merely
with
long
bamboo
canes
torches
and
canvas
sacks
these
weapons
appeared
very
curious
and
insufficient
to
the
children
but
their
use
was
speedily
apparent
for
darkness
having
come
upon
us
almost
before
we
reached
the
wood
i
lighted
the
torches
and
perceived
as
i
expected
that
every
branch
was
thickly
laden
with
ortolans
and
wild
pigeons
who
were
roosting
there
in
amazing
numbers
suddenly
aroused
by
the
glare
of
light
confusion
prevailed
among
the
terrified
birds
who
fluttered
helplessly
through
the
branches
dazzled
and
bewildered
and
many
falling
even
before
we
began
to
use
the
sticks
were
picked
up
and
put
in
the
bags
when
we
beat
and
struck
the
branches
it
was
as
much
as
my
wife
and
franz
could
do
to
gather
up
the
quantities
of
pigeons
that
soon
lay
on
the
ground
the
sacks
were
speedily
quite
full
we
turned
homeward
and
on
reaching
falconhurst
put
our
booty
in
safety
and
gladly
withdrew
to
rest
the
following
day
was
wholly
occupied
in
plucking
boiling
roasting
and
stewing
so
that
we
could
find
time
for
nothing
else
but
next
morning
a
great
expedition
to
woodlands
was
arranged
that
measures
might
there
be
taken
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
the
monkey
invasion
i
hoped
could
i
but
catch
the
mischievous
rascals
at
their
work
of
destruction
to
inflict
upon
them
such
a
chastisement
as
would
effectually
make
them
shun
the
neighborhood
of
our
farm
for
the
future
my
wife
provided
us
with
a
good
store
of
provisions
as
we
were
likely
to
be
absent
several
days
while
she
with
franz
and
turk
remained
at
home
i
took
with
me
abundance
of
specially
prepared
birdlime
far
stronger
than
that
which
we
used
for
the
pigeons
a
number
of
short
posts
plenty
of
string
and
a
supply
of
cocoanut
shells
and
gourds
the
buffalo
carried
all
these
things
and
one
or
two
of
the
boys
besides
i
myself
bestrode
the
ass
and
in
due
time
we
arrived
at
a
convenient
spot
in
the
forest
near
woodlands
well
concealed
by
thick
bushes
and
underwood
where
we
made
a
little
encampment
pitching
the
small
tent
and
tethering
the
animals
the
dogs
too
were
tied
up
lest
they
should
roam
about
and
betray
our
presence
we
found
the
cottage
quite
quiet
and
deserted
and
i
lost
no
time
in
preparing
for
the
reception
of
visitors
hoping
to
be
all
ready
for
them
and
out
of
sight
before
they
arrived
we
drove
the
stakes
lightly
into
the
ground
so
as
to
form
an
irregular
paling
round
the
house
winding
string
in
and
out
in
all
directions
between
them
thus
making
a
kind
of
labyrinth
through
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
pass
without
touching
either
the
stakes
or
the
cords
everything
was
plentifully
besmeared
with
birdlime
and
basins
of
the
mixture
were
set
in
all
directions
strewn
with
rice
maize
and
other
dainties
for
bait
night
came
without
any
interruption
to
our
proceedings
and
all
being
then
accomplished
we
retired
to
rest
beneath
the
shelter
of
our
little
tent
very
early
in
the
morning
we
heard
a
confused
noise
such
as
we
knew
betokened
the
approach
of
a
large
number
of
apes
we
armed
ourselves
with
strong
clubs
and
cudgels
and
holding
the
dogs
in
leash
made
our
way
silently
behind
the
thickets
till
ourselves
unseen
we
could
command
a
view
of
all
that
went
on
and
strange
indeed
was
the
scene
which
ensued
the
noise
of
rustling
cracking
and
creaking
among
the
branches
with
horrid
cries
and
shrieks
and
chattering
increased
to
a
degree
sufficient
to
make
us
perfectly
giddy
and
then
out
from
the
forest
poured
the
whole
disorderly
rabble
of
monkeys
scrambling
springing
leaping
from
the
trees
racing
and
tumbling
across
the
grassy
space
toward
the
house
when
at
once
attracted
by
the
novelties
they
saw
they
made
for
the
jars
and
bowls
they
seemed
innumerable
but
the
confused
rapid
way
in
which
they
swarmed
hither
and
thither
made
it
difficult
to
judge
accurately
of
their
numbers
they
dashed
fearlessly
through
and
over
the
palings
in
all
directions
some
rushing
at
the
eatables
some
scrambling
on
to
the
roof
where
they
commenced
tugging
at
the
wooden
pegs
with
a
view
to
forcing
an
entrance
gradually
however
as
they
rambled
over
the
place
all
in
turn
became
besmeared
with
our
birdlime
on
head
paws
or
back
or
breast
the
wretched
predicament
of
the
apes
increased
every
instant
some
sat
down
and
with
the
most
ludicrous
gestures
tried
to
clean
themselves
others
were
hopelessly
entangled
in
stakes
and
cordage
which
they
trailed
about
after
them
looking
the
picture
of
bewildered
despair
others
again
endeavored
to
help
one
another
and
stuck
fast
together
the
more
they
pulled
and
tugged
and
kicked
the
worse
became
their
plight
many
had
the
gourds
and
cocoanut
shells
lumbering
and
clattering
about
with
them
their
paws
having
been
caught
when
they
sought
to
obtain
the
rice
or
fruit
we
had
put
for
bait
most
ridiculous
of
all
was
the
condition
of
one
old
fellow
who
had
found
a
calabash
containing
palm
wine
and
eagerly
drinking
it
was
immediately
fitted
with
a
mask
for
the
shell
stuck
to
his
forehead
and
whiskers
of
course
covering
his
eyes
and
he
blundered
about
cutting
the
wildest
capers
in
his
efforts
to
get
rid
of
the
encumbrance
numbers
took
to
flight
but
as
we
had
spread
birdlime
on
several
of
the
trees
around
many
apes
found
themselves
fixed
to
or
hanging
from
the
branches
where
they
remained
in
woeful
durance
struggling
and
shrieking
horribly
the
panic
being
now
general
i
loosed
the
three
dogs
whose
impatience
had
been
almost
uncontrollable
and
who
now
rushed
to
the
attack
of
the
unfortunate
monkeys
as
though
burning
with
zeal
to
execute
justice
upon
desperate
criminals
the
place
soon
had
the
appearance
of
a
ghastly
battlefield
for
we
were
obliged
to
do
our
part
with
the
clubs
and
sticks
till
the
din
of
howling
yelling
barking
in
every
conceivable
tone
of
rage
and
pain
gave
place
to
an
awful
silence
and
we
looked
with
a
shudder
on
the
shocking
spectacle
around
us
at
least
forty
apes
lay
mangled
and
dead
and
the
boys
began
to
be
quite
sad
and
till
i
fully
sharing
their
feelings
hastened
to
turn
their
thoughts
to
active
employment
in
removing
and
burying
the
slain
burning
the
stakes
cordage
bowls
everything
concerned
in
the
execution
of
our
deadly
stratagem
after
that
we
betook
ourselves
to
the
task
of
restoring
order
to
our
dismantled
cottage
and
seeking
for
the
scattered
flock
of
sheep
goats
and
poultry
we
gradually
collected
them
hoping
to
settle
them
once
more
peacefully
in
their
yards
and
sheds
while
thus
engaged
we
repeatedly
heard
a
sound
as
of
something
heavy
falling
from
a
tree
on
going
to
look
we
found
three
splendid
birds
caught
on
some
of
the
limed
sticks
we
had
placed
loose
in
the
branches
two
of
these
proved
to
be
a
variety
of
the
blue
molucca
pigeon
the
third
i
assumed
to
be
the
nicobar
pigeon
having
met
with
descriptions
of
its
resplendent
green
bronze
and
steely
blue
plumage
and
i
was
pleased
to
think
of
domesticating
them
and
establishing
them
at
first
tenants
of
a
suitable
dwelling
near
the
cave
first
tenants
father
said
fritz
do
you
expect
to
catch
more
like
these
not
exactly
catch
them
i
mean
to
practice
a
secret
art
much
can
be
done
by
magic
fritz
further
explanation
i
declined
to
give
in
a
few
days
woodlands
was
once
more
set
in
order
and
everything
settled
and
comfortable
so
that
we
returned
without
further
adventure
to
falconhurst
where
we
were
joyfully
welcomed
everyone
agreed
that
we
must
go
at
once
to
tentholm
to
make
the
proposed
in
the
rock
several
other
things
there
also
requiring
our
attention
we
made
arrangements
for
a
prolonged
stay
my
plan
for
the
was
to
hollow
out
an
ample
space
in
the
cliff
facing
toward
jackal
river
and
close
to
our
rocky
home
fitting
that
up
with
partitions
perches
and
nesting
places
while
a
large
wooden
front
was
fitted
on
to
the
opening
with
slides
or
shutters
and
a
broad
platform
in
front
where
the
birds
could
rest
and
walk
about
when
after
the
work
of
a
few
weeks
we
thought
it
was
fit
for
habitation
i
set
the
other
children
to
work
at
some
distance
from
our
cavern
and
summoning
fritz
now
my
faithful
assistant
said
i
it
is
time
to
conjure
the
new
colonists
to
their
settlement
here
yes
i
continued
laughing
at
his
puzzled
look
i
mean
to
play
a
regular
trick
you
must
know
such
gentry
are
very
ingenious
not
only
in
keeping
their
own
pigeons
safe
but
in
adding
to
their
numbers
by
attracting
those
of
other
people
all
i
want
is
some
soft
clay
aniseed
and
salt
of
which
i
will
compound
a
mixture
which
our
birds
will
like
very
much
and
the
smell
of
which
will
bring
others
to
share
it
with
them
i
can
easily
get
you
those
things
father
i
shall
want
some
oil
of
aniseed
besides
said
i
to
put
on
the
so
that
the
birds
feathers
may
touch
it
as
they
may
pass
in
and
out
and
become
scented
with
what
will
attract
the
wild
pigeons
this
i
can
obtain
by
pounding
aniseed
therefore
bring
me
the
mortar
and
some
oil
when
this
was
strongly
impregnated
with
the
aromatic
oil
from
the
seeds
for
i
did
not
propose
to
distill
it
in
regular
style
i
strained
it
through
a
cloth
pressing
it
strongly
the
result
answered
my
purpose
and
the
scent
would
certainly
remain
for
some
days
all
my
preparations
being
completed
the
pigeons
were
installed
in
their
new
residence
and
the
slides
closed
the
european
birds
were
by
this
time
quite
friendly
with
the
three
beautiful
strangers
and
when
the
other
boys
came
home
and
scrambled
up
the
ladder
to
peep
in
at
a
little
pane
of
glass
i
had
fixed
in
front
they
saw
them
all
contentedly
picking
up
grain
and
pecking
at
the
magic
food
as
fritz
called
it
although
he
did
not
betray
my
secret
arts
to
his
brothers
early
on
the
third
morning
i
aroused
fritz
and
directed
him
to
ascend
the
rope
ladder
and
arrange
a
cord
on
the
sliding
door
of
the
dovecot
by
which
it
could
be
opened
or
closed
from
below
also
he
poured
fresh
aniseed
oil
all
about
the
entrance
after
which
we
returned
and
awoke
the
rest
of
the
family
telling
them
that
if
they
liked
to
make
haste
they
might
see
me
let
the
pigeons
fly
everybody
came
to
the
dovecot
understanding
that
some
ceremony
was
to
attend
the
event
and
i
waved
a
wand
with
mock
solemnity
while
i
muttered
a
seeming
incantation
and
then
gave
fritz
a
sign
to
draw
up
the
sliding
panel
presently
out
popped
the
pretty
heads
of
the
captives
the
soft
eyes
glanced
about
in
all
directions
they
withdrew
they
ventured
forth
again
they
came
timidly
out
on
the
veranda
as
little
franz
expressed
it
then
as
though
suddenly
startled
the
whole
party
took
wing
with
the
shrill
whizzing
sound
peculiar
to
the
flight
of
pigeons
and
circling
above
us
as
they
rose
higher
and
higher
finally
darting
quite
out
of
sight
while
we
were
yet
gazing
after
them
they
reappeared
and
settled
quietly
on
the
dovecot
but
as
we
congratulated
ourselves
on
a
return
which
showed
that
they
accepted
this
as
a
home
up
sprang
the
three
blue
pigeons
the
noble
foreigners
for
whom
chiefly
i
had
planned
the
house
and
rising
in
circles
high
in
air
winged
their
rapid
way
direct
toward
falconhurst
their
departure
had
such
an
air
of
determination
and
resolve
about
it
that
i
feared
them
lost
to
us
forever
endeavoring
to
console
ourselves
by
petting
our
four
remaining
birds
we
could
not
forget
this
disappointment
and
all
day
long
the
dovecot
remained
the
center
of
attraction
nothing
however
was
seen
of
the
fugitives
until
about
the
middle
of
the
next
day
when
most
of
us
were
hard
at
work
inside
the
cavern
jack
sprang
in
full
of
excitement
exclaiming
he
is
there
he
is
come
he
really
is
who
who
is
there
what
do
you
mean
the
blue
pigeon
to
be
sure
hurrah
hurrah
oh
nonsense
said
ernest
you
want
to
play
us
a
trick
why
should
it
be
cried
i
i
fully
believe
we
shall
see
them
all
soon
out
ran
everybody
to
the
dovecot
and
there
sure
enough
stood
the
pretty
fellow
but
not
alone
for
he
was
billing
and
cooing
to
a
mate
a
stranger
of
his
own
breed
apparently
inviting
her
to
enter
his
dwelling
for
he
popped
in
and
out
of
the
door
bowing
sidling
and
cooing
in
a
most
irresistible
manner
until
the
shy
little
lady
yielded
to
his
blandishments
and
tripped
daintily
in
now
let
shut
the
door
pull
the
cord
and
close
the
panel
shouted
the
boys
making
a
rush
at
the
string
stop
cried
i
let
the
string
alone
i
wo
have
you
frighten
the
little
darlings
besides
the
others
will
be
coming
would
you
shut
the
door
in
their
faces
here
they
come
here
they
come
exclaimed
fritz
whose
keen
eye
marked
the
birds
afar
and
to
our
delight
the
second
blue
pigeon
arrived
likewise
with
a
mate
whom
after
a
pretty
little
flirtation
scene
of
real
and
assumed
modesty
on
her
part
he
succeeded
in
leading
home
the
third
and
handsomest
of
the
new
pigeons
was
the
last
in
making
his
appearance
perhaps
he
had
greater
difficulty
than
the
others
in
finding
a
mate
as
distinguished
in
rank
and
beauty
as
himself
however
we
fully
expected
them
and
the
boys
talked
of
the
arrival
of
and
nicobar
as
a
matter
of
course
late
in
the
day
franz
and
his
mother
went
out
to
provide
for
supper
but
the
child
returned
directly
exclaiming
that
we
must
hasten
to
the
dovecot
to
see
something
beautiful
accordingly
a
general
rush
was
made
out
of
the
cave
and
we
saw
with
delight
that
the
third
stranger
also
had
returned
with
a
lovely
bride
and
encouraged
by
the
presence
of
the
first
arrivals
they
soon
made
themselves
at
home
in
a
short
time
commenced
and
among
the
materials
collected
by
the
birds
i
observed
a
long
gray
moss
or
lichen
and
thought
it
might
very
possibly
be
the
same
which
in
the
west
indies
is
gathered
from
the
bark
of
old
trees
where
it
grows
and
hangs
in
great
beards
to
be
used
instead
of
for
stuffing
mattresses
my
wife
no
sooner
heard
of
it
than
her
active
brain
devised
fifty
plans
for
making
it
of
use
would
we
but
collect
enough
she
would
clean
and
sort
it
and
there
would
be
no
end
to
the
bolsters
pillows
saddles
and
cushions
she
would
stuff
with
it
for
the
discovery
of
nutmegs
we
had
also
to
thank
the
pigeons
and
they
were
carefully
planted
in
our
orchard
for
some
time
no
event
of
particular
note
occurred
until
at
length
jack
as
usual
got
into
a
scrape
causing
thereby
no
little
excitement
at
home
he
went
off
early
on
one
of
his
own
particular
private
expeditions
he
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
this
that
he
might
surprise
us
with
some
new
acquisition
on
his
return
this
time
however
he
came
back
in
most
wretched
plight
covered
with
mud
and
green
slime
a
great
bundle
of
spanish
canes
was
on
his
back
muddy
and
green
like
himself
he
had
lost
a
shoe
and
altogether
presented
a
ludicrous
picture
of
misery
at
which
we
could
have
laughed
had
he
not
seemed
more
ready
to
cry
my
dear
boy
what
has
happened
to
you
where
have
you
been
only
in
the
swamp
behind
the
powder
magazine
father
replied
he
i
went
to
get
reeds
for
my
because
i
wanted
to
weave
some
baskets
and
and
i
saw
such
beauties
a
little
way
off
in
the
marsh
much
finer
than
those
close
by
the
edge
that
i
tried
to
get
at
them
i
jumped
from
one
firm
spot
to
another
till
at
last
i
slipped
and
sank
over
my
ankles
i
tried
to
get
on
toward
the
reeds
which
were
close
by
but
in
i
went
deeper
and
deeper
till
i
was
above
the
knees
in
thick
soft
mud
and
there
i
stuck
i
screamed
and
shouted
but
nobody
came
and
i
can
tell
you
i
was
in
a
regular
fright
at
last
who
should
appear
but
my
faithful
fangs
he
knew
my
voice
and
came
close
up
to
me
right
over
the
swamp
but
all
the
poor
beast
could
do
was
to
help
me
to
make
a
row
i
wonder
you
did
not
hear
us
the
very
rocks
rang
but
nothing
came
of
it
so
despair
drove
me
to
think
of
an
expedient
i
cut
down
all
the
reeds
i
could
reach
round
and
round
me
and
bound
them
together
into
this
bundle
which
made
a
firm
place
on
which
to
lean
while
i
worked
and
kicked
about
to
free
my
feet
and
legs
and
after
much
struggling
i
managed
to
get
astride
of
the
reeds
there
i
sat
supported
above
the
mud
and
slime
while
fangs
ran
yelping
backward
and
forward
between
me
and
the
bank
seeming
surprised
i
did
not
follow
suddenly
i
thought
of
catching
hold
of
his
tail
he
dragged
and
pulled
and
i
sprawled
and
crawled
and
waded
sometimes
on
my
reeds
like
a
raft
sometimes
lugging
them
along
with
me
till
we
luckily
got
back
to
terra
firma
but
i
had
a
near
squeak
for
it
i
can
tell
you
a
fortunate
escape
indeed
my
boy
cried
i
and
i
thank
god
for
it
fangs
has
really
acted
a
heroic
part
as
your
deliverer
and
you
have
shown
great
presence
of
mind
now
go
with
your
mother
and
get
rid
of
the
slimy
traces
of
your
disaster
you
have
brought
me
splendid
canes
exactly
what
i
want
for
a
new
scheme
of
mine
the
fact
was
i
meant
to
try
to
construct
a
loom
for
my
wife
for
i
knew
she
understood
weaving
so
i
chose
two
fine
strong
reeds
and
splitting
them
carefully
bound
them
together
again
that
when
dry
they
might
be
quite
straight
and
equal
and
fit
for
a
frame
smaller
reeds
were
cut
into
pieces
and
sharpened
for
the
teeth
of
the
comb
the
boys
did
this
for
me
without
in
the
least
knowing
their
use
and
great
fun
they
made
of
father
monster
toothpicks
in
time
all
the
various
parts
of
the
loom
were
made
ready
and
put
together
my
wife
knowing
nothing
of
it
while
to
the
incessant
questions
of
the
children
i
replied
mysteriously
oh
it
is
an
outlandish
sort
of
musical
instrument
mother
will
know
how
to
play
upon
it
and
when
the
time
came
for
presenting
it
her
joy
was
only
equaled
by
the
amusement
and
interest
with
which
the
children
watched
her
movements
while
playing
the
loom
as
they
always
said
about
this
time
a
beautiful
little
foal
a
son
of
the
onager
was
added
to
our
stud
and
as
he
promised
to
grow
up
strong
and
tractable
we
soon
saw
how
useful
he
would
be
the
name
of
swift
was
given
to
him
and
he
was
to
be
trained
for
my
own
riding
the
interior
arrangements
of
the
cavern
being
now
well
forward
i
applied
myself
to
contriving
an
aqueduct
that
fresh
water
might
be
led
close
up
to
our
cave
for
it
was
a
long
way
to
go
to
fetch
it
from
jackal
river
and
especially
inconvenient
on
washing
days
as
i
wanted
to
do
this
before
the
rainy
season
began
i
set
about
it
at
once
pipes
of
hollow
bamboo
answered
the
purpose
well
and
a
large
cask
formed
the
reservoir
the
supply
was
good
and
the
comfort
of
having
it
close
at
hand
so
great
that
the
mother
declared
she
was
as
well
pleased
with
our
engineering
as
if
we
had
made
her
a
fountain
and
marble
basin
adorned
with
mermaids
and
dolphins
anticipating
the
setting
in
of
the
rains
i
pressed
forward
all
work
connected
with
stores
for
the
winter
and
great
was
the
of
roots
fruits
and
grains
potatoes
rice
guavas
sweet
acorns
load
after
load
arrived
at
the
cavern
and
the
active
needle
was
in
constant
requisition
as
the
demand
for
more
sacks
and
bags
was
incessant
casks
and
barrels
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
were
pressed
into
the
service
until
at
last
the
raft
was
knocked
to
pieces
and
its
tubs
made
to
do
duty
in
the
storerooms
the
weather
became
very
unsettled
and
stormy
heavy
clouds
gathered
in
the
horizon
and
passing
storms
of
wind
with
thunder
lightning
and
torrents
of
rain
swept
over
the
face
of
nature
from
time
to
time
the
sea
was
in
frequent
commotion
heavy
ground
swells
drove
masses
of
water
hissing
and
foaming
against
the
cliffs
everything
heralded
the
approaching
rains
all
nature
joined
in
sounding
forth
the
solemn
overture
to
the
grandest
work
of
the
year
it
was
now
near
the
beginning
of
the
month
of
june
and
we
had
twelve
weeks
of
bad
weather
before
us
we
established
some
of
the
animals
with
ourselves
at
the
salt
cave
the
cow
the
ass
lightfoot
storm
and
the
dogs
were
all
necessary
to
us
while
knips
fangs
and
the
eagle
were
sure
to
be
a
great
amusement
in
the
long
evenings
the
boys
would
ride
over
to
falconhurst
very
often
to
see
that
all
was
in
order
there
and
fetch
anything
required
much
remained
to
be
done
in
order
to
give
the
cave
a
comfortable
appearance
which
became
more
desirable
now
that
we
had
to
live
indoors
the
darkness
of
the
inner
regions
annoyed
me
and
i
set
myself
to
invent
a
remedy
after
some
thought
i
called
in
jack
assistance
and
we
got
a
very
tall
strong
bamboo
which
would
reach
right
up
to
the
vaulted
roof
this
we
planted
in
the
earthen
floor
securing
well
by
driving
wedges
in
round
it
jack
ascended
this
pole
very
cleverly
taking
with
him
a
hammer
and
chisel
to
enlarge
a
crevice
in
the
roof
so
as
to
fix
a
pulley
by
means
of
which
when
he
descended
i
drew
up
a
large
lantern
well
supplied
with
oil
and
as
there
were
four
wicks
it
afforded
a
very
fair
amount
of
light
several
days
were
spent
in
arranging
the
different
rooms
ernest
and
franz
undertook
the
library
fixing
shelves
and
setting
the
books
in
order
jack
and
his
mother
took
in
hand
the
sitting
room
and
kitchen
while
fritz
and
i
as
better
able
for
heavy
work
arranged
the
workshops
the
carpenter
bench
the
turning
lathe
and
a
large
chest
of
tools
were
set
in
convenient
places
and
many
tools
and
instruments
hung
on
the
walls
an
adjoining
chamber
was
fitted
up
as
a
forge
with
fireplace
bellows
and
anvil
complete
all
which
we
had
found
in
the
ship
packed
together
and
ready
to
set
up
when
these
great
affairs
were
settled
we
still
found
in
all
directions
work
to
be
done
shelves
tables
benches
movable
steps
cupboards
pegs
door
handles
and
bolts
there
seemed
no
end
to
our
requirements
and
we
often
thought
of
the
enormous
amount
of
work
necessary
to
maintain
the
comforts
and
conveniences
of
life
which
at
home
we
had
received
as
matters
of
course
but
in
reality
the
more
there
was
to
do
the
better
and
i
never
ceased
contriving
fresh
improvements
being
fully
aware
of
the
importance
of
constant
employment
as
a
means
of
strengthening
and
maintaining
the
health
of
mind
and
body
this
indeed
with
a
consciousness
of
continual
progress
toward
a
desirable
end
is
found
to
constitute
the
main
element
of
happiness
our
rocky
home
was
greatly
improved
by
a
wide
porch
which
i
made
along
the
whole
front
of
our
rooms
and
entrances
by
leveling
the
ground
to
form
a
terrace
and
sheltering
it
with
a
veranda
of
bamboo
supported
by
pillars
of
the
same
ernest
and
franz
were
highly
successful
as
librarians
the
books
when
unpacked
and
arranged
proved
to
be
a
most
valuable
collection
capable
of
affording
every
sort
of
educational
advantage
besides
a
variety
of
books
of
voyages
travels
divinity
and
natural
history
several
containing
fine
colored
illustrations
there
were
histories
and
scientific
works
as
well
as
standard
fictions
in
several
languages
also
a
good
assortment
of
maps
charts
mathematical
and
astronomical
instruments
and
an
excellent
pair
of
globes
i
foresaw
much
interesting
study
on
discovering
that
we
possessed
the
grammars
and
dictionaries
of
a
great
many
languages
a
subject
for
which
we
all
had
a
taste
with
french
we
were
well
acquainted
fritz
and
ernest
had
begun
to
learn
english
at
school
and
made
further
progress
during
a
visit
to
england
the
mother
who
had
once
been
intimate
with
a
dutch
family
could
speak
that
language
pretty
well
after
a
great
deal
of
discussion
we
agreed
to
study
different
languages
so
that
in
the
event
of
meeting
with
people
of
other
nations
there
should
be
at
least
one
of
the
family
able
to
communicate
with
them
all
determined
to
improve
our
knowledge
of
german
and
french
the
two
elder
boys
were
to
study
english
and
dutch
with
their
mother
ernest
already
possessing
considerable
knowledge
of
latin
wished
to
continue
to
study
it
so
as
to
be
able
to
make
use
of
the
many
works
on
natural
history
and
medicine
written
in
that
language
jack
announced
that
he
meant
to
learn
spanish
because
it
sounded
so
grand
and
imposing
i
myself
was
interested
in
the
malay
language
knowing
it
to
be
so
widely
spoken
in
the
islands
of
the
eastern
seas
and
thinking
it
as
likely
as
any
other
to
be
useful
to
us
our
family
circle
by
and
by
represented
babel
in
miniature
for
scraps
and
fragments
of
all
these
tongues
kept
buzzing
about
our
ears
from
morning
to
night
each
sporting
his
newly
acquired
word
or
sentence
on
every
possible
occasion
propounding
idioms
and
peculiar
expressions
like
riddles
to
puzzle
the
rest
in
this
way
the
labor
of
learning
was
very
considerably
lightened
and
everyone
came
to
know
a
few
words
of
each
language
occasionally
we
amused
ourselves
by
opening
chests
and
packages
hitherto
untouched
and
brought
unexpected
treasures
to
light
mirrors
wardrobes
a
pair
of
console
tables
with
polished
marble
tops
elegant
writing
tables
and
handsome
chairs
clocks
of
various
descriptions
a
musical
box
and
a
chronometer
were
found
and
by
degrees
our
abode
was
fitted
up
like
a
palace
so
that
sometimes
we
wondered
at
ourselves
and
felt
as
though
we
were
strutting
about
in
borrowed
plumes
the
children
begged
me
to
decide
on
a
name
for
our
dwelling
and
that
of
rockburg
was
chosen
unanimously
the
weeks
of
imprisonment
passed
so
rapidly
that
no
one
found
time
hang
heavy
on
his
hands
books
occupied
me
so
much
that
but
little
carpentering
was
done
yet
i
made
a
yoke
for
the
oxen
a
pair
of
cotton
wool
carders
and
a
spinning
wheel
for
my
wife
as
the
rainy
season
drew
to
a
close
the
weather
for
a
while
became
wilder
and
the
storms
fiercer
than
ever
thunder
roared
lightning
blazed
torrents
rushed
toward
the
sea
which
came
in
raging
billows
to
meet
them
lashed
to
fury
by
the
tempests
of
wind
which
swept
the
surface
of
the
deep
the
uproar
of
the
elements
came
to
an
end
at
last
nature
resumed
her
attitude
of
repose
her
smiling
aspect
of
peaceful
beauty
and
soon
all
traces
of
the
ravages
of
floods
and
storms
would
disappear
beneath
the
luxuriant
vegetation
of
the
tropics
gladly
quitting
the
sheltering
walls
of
rockburg
to
roam
once
more
in
the
open
air
we
crossed
jackal
river
for
a
walk
along
the
coast
and
presently
fritz
with
his
sharp
eyes
observed
something
on
the
small
island
near
flamingo
marsh
which
was
he
said
long
and
rounded
resembling
a
boat
bottom
upward
examining
it
with
the
telescope
i
could
form
no
other
conjecture
and
we
resolved
to
make
it
the
object
of
an
excursion
next
day
being
delighted
to
resume
our
old
habit
of
starting
in
pursuit
of
adventure
the
boat
was
accordingly
got
in
readiness
it
required
some
repairs
and
fresh
pitching
and
then
we
made
for
the
point
of
interest
indulging
in
a
variety
of
surmises
as
to
what
we
should
find
it
proved
to
be
a
huge
stranded
whale
the
island
being
steep
and
rocky
it
was
necessary
to
be
careful
but
we
found
a
on
the
further
side
the
boys
hurried
by
the
nearest
way
to
the
beach
where
lay
the
monster
of
the
deep
while
i
clambered
to
the
highest
point
of
the
islet
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
mainland
from
rockburg
to
falconhurst
on
rejoining
my
sons
i
found
them
only
to
the
great
fish
and
as
i
drew
near
they
shouted
in
high
glee
oh
father
just
look
at
the
glorious
shells
and
coral
branches
we
are
finding
how
does
it
happen
that
there
are
such
quantities
only
consider
how
the
recent
storms
have
stirred
the
ocean
to
its
depths
no
doubt
thousands
of
have
been
detached
from
their
rocks
and
dashed
in
all
directions
by
the
waves
which
have
thrown
ashore
even
so
huge
a
creature
as
the
whale
yonder
yes
is
he
a
frightful
great
brute
cried
fritz
ever
so
much
larger
than
he
seemed
from
a
distance
the
worst
of
it
is
one
does
not
well
see
what
use
to
make
of
the
huge
carcass
why
make
to
be
sure
said
ernest
i
ca
say
he
a
beauty
though
and
it
is
much
pleasanter
to
gather
these
lovely
shells
than
to
cut
up
blubber
well
let
us
amuse
ourselves
with
them
for
the
present
said
i
but
in
the
afternoon
when
the
sea
is
calmer
we
will
return
with
the
necessary
implements
and
see
if
we
can
turn
the
stranded
whale
to
good
account
we
were
soon
ready
to
return
to
the
boat
but
ernest
had
a
fancy
for
remaining
alone
on
the
island
till
we
came
back
and
asked
my
permission
to
do
so
that
he
might
experience
for
an
hour
or
two
the
sensations
of
robinson
crusoe
to
this
however
i
would
not
consent
assuring
him
that
our
fate
as
a
solitary
family
gave
him
quite
sufficient
idea
of
shipwreck
on
an
uninhabited
island
and
that
his
lively
imagination
must
supply
the
rest
the
boys
found
it
hard
work
to
row
back
and
began
to
beg
of
me
to
exert
my
wonderful
inventive
powers
in
contriving
some
kind
of
you
lazy
fellows
returned
i
give
me
the
great
clockwork
out
of
a
church
tower
perhaps
i
might
be
able
to
relieve
your
labors
oh
father
cried
fritz
do
you
know
there
are
iron
wheels
in
the
clockwork
of
the
large
i
sure
mother
would
give
them
up
and
you
could
make
something
out
of
them
could
you
not
by
the
time
i
have
manufactured
a
out
of
a
i
think
your
arms
will
be
pretty
well
inured
to
the
use
of
your
oars
however
i
am
far
from
despising
the
hint
my
dear
fritz
is
coral
of
any
use
demanded
jack
suddenly
in
former
times
it
was
pounded
and
used
by
chemists
but
it
is
now
chiefly
used
for
various
ornaments
and
made
into
beads
for
necklaces
etc
as
such
it
is
greatly
prized
by
savages
and
were
we
to
fall
in
with
natives
we
might
very
possibly
find
a
store
of
coral
useful
in
bartering
with
them
for
the
present
we
will
arrange
these
treasures
of
the
deep
in
our
library
and
make
them
the
beginning
of
a
museum
of
natural
history
which
will
afford
us
equal
pleasure
and
instruction
one
might
almost
say
that
coral
belongs
at
once
to
the
animal
vegetable
and
mineral
kingdoms
remarked
fritz
it
is
hard
like
stone
it
has
stems
and
branches
like
a
shrub
and
i
believe
tiny
insects
inhabit
the
cells
do
they
not
father
you
are
right
fritz
coral
consists
of
the
calcareous
cells
of
minute
animals
so
built
up
as
to
form
a
structure
the
coral
fishery
gives
employment
to
many
men
in
the
persian
gulf
the
mediterranean
sea
and
other
places
the
instrument
commonly
used
consists
of
two
heavy
beams
of
wood
secured
together
at
right
angles
and
loaded
with
stones
hemp
and
netting
are
attached
to
the
under
side
of
the
beams
to
the
middle
of
which
is
fastened
one
end
of
a
strong
rope
by
which
the
apparatus
is
let
down
from
a
boat
and
guided
to
the
spots
where
the
coral
is
most
abundant
the
branches
of
the
coral
become
entangled
in
the
hemp
and
network
they
are
broken
off
from
the
rock
and
are
drawn
to
the
surface
of
the
water
left
undisturbed
these
coral
insects
laboring
incessantly
raise
foundations
on
which
in
course
of
time
fertile
islands
appear
clothed
with
verdure
and
inhabited
by
man
why
father
here
we
are
at
the
landing
place
exclaimed
jack
it
has
seemed
quite
easy
to
pull
since
you
began
to
tell
us
such
interesting
things
very
interesting
indeed
but
did
you
notice
that
the
wind
had
changed
jack
remarked
ernest
as
he
shipped
his
oar
the
animated
recital
of
our
adventures
the
sight
of
the
lovely
shells
and
corals
and
the
proposed
work
for
the
afternoon
inspired
the
mother
and
franz
with
a
great
wish
to
accompany
us
to
this
i
gladly
consented
only
stipulating
that
we
should
go
provided
with
food
water
and
a
compass
for
said
i
the
sea
has
only
just
ceased
from
its
raging
and
being
at
the
best
of
times
of
uncertain
and
capricious
nature
we
may
chance
to
be
detained
on
the
island
or
forced
to
land
at
a
considerable
distance
from
home
dinner
was
quickly
dispatched
and
preparations
set
on
foot
the
more
oil
we
could
obtain
the
better
for
a
great
deal
was
used
in
the
large
lantern
which
burnt
day
and
night
in
the
recesses
of
the
cave
therefore
all
available
casks
and
barrels
were
pressed
into
the
service
many
of
course
once
full
of
pickled
herrings
potted
pigeons
and
other
winter
stores
were
now
empty
and
we
took
a
goodly
fleet
of
these
in
tow
knives
hatchets
and
the
boys
climbing
buskins
were
put
on
board
and
we
set
forth
the
labor
of
the
oar
being
greater
than
ever
now
that
our
freight
was
so
much
increased
the
sea
being
calm
and
the
tide
suiting
better
we
found
it
easy
to
land
close
to
the
whale
my
first
care
was
to
place
the
boat
as
well
as
the
casks
in
perfect
security
after
which
we
proceeded
to
a
close
inspection
of
our
prize
its
enormous
size
quite
startled
my
wife
and
her
little
boy
the
length
being
from
sixty
to
feet
and
the
girth
between
thirty
and
forty
while
the
weight
could
not
have
been
less
than
lbs
the
color
was
a
uniform
velvety
black
and
the
enormous
head
about
of
the
length
of
the
entire
bulk
the
eyes
quite
small
not
much
larger
than
those
of
an
ox
and
the
ears
almost
undiscernible
the
jaw
opened
very
far
back
and
was
nearly
sixteen
feet
in
length
the
most
curious
part
of
its
structure
being
the
remarkable
substance
known
as
whalebone
masses
of
which
appeared
all
along
the
jaws
solid
at
the
base
and
splitting
into
a
sort
of
fringe
at
the
extremity
this
arrangement
is
for
the
purpose
of
aiding
the
whale
in
procuring
its
food
and
separating
it
from
the
water
the
tongue
was
remarkably
large
soft
and
full
of
oil
the
opening
of
the
throat
wonderfully
small
scarcely
two
inches
in
diameter
why
what
can
the
monster
eat
exclaimed
fritz
he
never
can
swallow
a
proper
mouthful
down
this
little
gullet
the
mode
of
feeding
adopted
by
the
whale
is
so
curious
i
replied
that
i
must
explain
it
to
you
before
we
begin
work
this
animal
for
i
should
tell
you
that
a
whale
is
not
a
fish
he
possesses
no
gills
he
breathes
atmospheric
air
and
would
be
drowned
if
too
long
detained
below
the
surface
of
the
water
this
animal
then
frequents
those
parts
of
the
ocean
best
supplied
with
the
various
creatures
on
which
he
feeds
shrimps
small
fish
lobsters
various
mollusks
and
medusae
form
his
diet
driving
with
open
mouth
through
the
congregated
shoals
of
these
little
creatures
the
whale
engulfs
them
by
millions
in
his
enormous
jaws
and
continues
his
destructive
course
until
he
has
sufficiently
charged
his
mouth
with
prey
closing
his
jaws
and
forcing
out
through
the
interstices
of
the
whalebone
the
water
which
he
has
taken
together
with
his
prey
he
retains
the
captured
animals
and
swallows
them
at
his
leisure
the
nostrils
or
are
placed
you
see
on
the
upper
part
of
the
head
in
order
that
the
whale
may
rise
to
breathe
and
repose
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
showing
very
little
of
his
huge
carcass
the
breathings
are
called
because
a
column
of
mixed
vapor
and
water
is
thrown
from
the
sometimes
to
a
height
of
twenty
feet
and
now
boys
fasten
on
your
buskins
and
let
me
see
if
you
can
face
the
work
of
climbing
this
slippery
mountain
of
flesh
and
cutting
it
up
fritz
and
jack
stripped
and
went
to
work
directly
scrambling
over
the
back
of
the
head
where
they
assisted
me
to
cut
away
the
lips
so
as
to
reach
the
whalebone
a
quantity
of
which
was
detached
and
carried
to
the
boat
ernest
labored
manfully
at
the
creature
side
cutting
out
slabs
of
blubber
while
his
mother
and
franz
helped
as
well
as
they
could
to
put
it
in
casks
presently
we
had
a
multitude
of
unbidden
guests
the
air
was
filled
by
the
shrill
screams
and
hoarse
croaks
and
cries
of
numbers
of
birds
of
prey
they
flew
around
us
in
ever
narrowing
circles
and
becoming
bolder
as
their
voracity
was
excited
by
the
near
view
of
the
tempting
prey
they
alighted
close
to
us
snatching
morsels
greedily
from
under
the
very
strokes
of
our
knives
and
hatchets
our
work
was
seriously
interrupted
by
these
feathered
marauders
who
after
all
were
no
greater
robbers
than
we
ourselves
we
kept
them
off
as
well
as
we
could
by
blows
from
our
tools
and
several
were
killed
my
wife
taking
possession
of
them
immediately
for
the
sake
of
the
feathers
it
was
nearly
time
to
leave
the
island
but
first
i
stripped
off
a
long
piece
of
the
skin
to
be
used
for
traces
harness
and
other
it
was
about
of
an
inch
thick
and
very
soft
and
oily
but
i
knew
it
would
shrink
and
be
tough
and
durable
i
also
took
a
part
of
the
gums
in
which
the
roots
of
the
baleen
or
whalebone
was
still
embedded
having
read
that
this
is
considered
quite
a
delicacy
as
well
as
the
skin
which
when
properly
dressed
and
cut
in
little
cubes
like
black
dice
has
been
compared
by
enthusiastic
and
probably
very
hungry
travelers
to
cocoanut
and
the
boys
thought
the
tongue
might
prove
equally
palatable
but
i
valued
it
only
on
account
of
the
large
quantity
of
oil
it
contained
with
a
heavy
freight
we
put
to
sea
and
made
what
haste
we
could
to
reach
home
and
cleanse
our
persons
from
the
unpleasant
traces
of
the
disgusting
work
in
which
we
had
spent
the
day
next
morning
we
started
at
dawn
my
wife
and
franz
were
left
behind
for
our
proposed
work
was
even
more
horrible
than
that
of
the
preceding
day
they
could
not
assist
and
had
no
inclination
to
witness
it
it
was
my
intention
to
open
the
carcass
completely
and
penetrating
the
interior
to
obtain
various
portions
of
the
intestines
thinking
that
it
would
be
possible
to
convert
the
larger
ones
into
vessels
fit
for
holding
the
oil
this
time
we
laid
aside
our
clothes
and
wore
only
strong
canvas
trousers
when
we
commenced
operations
which
were
vigorously
carried
on
during
the
whole
of
the
day
then
satisfied
that
we
could
do
so
with
a
clear
conscience
we
abandoned
the
remains
to
the
birds
of
prey
and
with
a
full
cargo
set
sail
for
home
on
the
way
it
appeared
to
strike
the
boys
who
had
made
not
the
slightest
objection
to
the
singularly
unpleasant
task
i
had
set
them
as
very
strange
that
i
should
wish
to
possess
what
they
had
been
working
so
hard
to
procure
for
me
what
can
have
made
you
wish
to
bring
away
that
brute
entrails
father
are
they
of
any
use
there
are
countries
i
replied
where
no
wood
grows
of
which
to
make
barrels
and
no
hemp
for
thread
string
and
cordage
necessity
the
mother
of
all
the
more
valuable
inventions
has
taught
the
inhabitants
of
those
countries
greenlanders
esquimaux
and
others
to
think
of
substitutes
and
they
use
the
intestines
of
the
whale
for
one
purpose
the
sinews
and
nerves
for
the
other
we
were
right
glad
to
land
and
get
rid
for
the
present
of
our
unpleasant
materials
the
further
preparation
of
which
was
work
in
store
for
the
following
day
a
refreshing
bath
clean
clothes
and
supper
cheered
us
all
up
and
we
slept
in
peace
chapter
xi
a
dangerous
visitor
and
its
victim
now
for
the
finishing
up
of
this
dirty
job
cried
i
merrily
as
we
all
woke
up
next
morning
at
daybreak
and
after
the
regular
work
was
done
we
commenced
operations
by
raising
a
stand
or
rough
scaffold
on
which
the
tubs
full
of
blubber
were
placed
and
heavily
pressed
so
that
the
purest
and
finest
oil
overflowed
into
vessels
underneath
the
blubber
was
afterward
boiled
in
a
caldron
over
a
fire
kindled
at
some
distance
from
our
abode
and
by
skimming
and
straining
through
a
coarse
cloth
we
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
large
supply
of
excellent
which
in
casks
and
bags
made
of
the
intestines
was
safely
stowed
away
in
the
cellar
as
the
children
called
our
roughest
storeroom
this
day
work
was
far
from
agreeable
and
the
dreadful
smell
oppressed
us
all
more
especially
my
poor
wife
who
nevertheless
endured
it
with
her
accustomed
good
temper
although
she
very
urgently
recommended
that
the
new
island
should
be
the
headquarters
for
another
colony
where
said
she
any
animals
we
leave
would
be
safe
from
apes
and
other
plunderers
and
where
you
would
find
it
so
very
convenient
to
boil
strain
and
the
like
this
proposal
met
with
hearty
approval
especially
from
the
boys
who
were
always
charmed
with
any
new
plan
and
they
were
eager
to
act
upon
it
at
once
but
when
i
reminded
them
of
the
putrefying
carcass
which
lay
there
they
confessed
it
would
be
better
to
allow
wind
and
storms
birds
and
insects
to
do
their
work
in
purging
the
atmosphere
and
reducing
the
whale
to
a
skeleton
before
we
revisited
the
island
the
idea
of
a
kept
recurring
to
my
brain
i
determined
to
attempt
to
make
one
i
took
an
iron
bar
which
when
laid
across
the
middle
of
the
boat
projected
about
a
foot
each
way
i
provided
this
bar
in
the
middle
with
ribbed
machinery
and
at
each
end
with
a
sort
of
nave
in
which
as
in
a
cart
wheel
four
flat
spokes
or
paddles
were
fixed
obliquely
these
were
intended
to
do
the
rowers
part
then
the
jack
was
arranged
to
act
upon
the
machinery
in
the
middle
of
the
iron
in
such
a
way
that
one
of
its
strong
cogwheels
bit
firmly
into
the
ribs
so
that
when
it
was
wound
up
it
caused
the
bar
to
revolve
rapidly
of
course
turning
with
it
the
paddles
fixed
at
either
end
which
consequently
struck
the
water
so
as
to
propel
the
boat
although
this
contrivance
left
much
to
be
desired
in
the
way
of
improvement
still
when
fritz
and
i
wound
up
the
machinery
and
went
off
on
a
trial
trip
across
the
bay
we
splashed
along
at
such
a
famous
rate
that
the
shores
rang
with
the
cheers
and
clapping
of
the
whole
family
delighted
to
behold
what
they
considered
my
brilliant
success
everyone
wanted
to
go
on
board
and
take
a
cruise
but
as
it
was
getting
late
i
could
not
consent
a
trip
next
day
however
was
promised
to
cape
disappointment
and
the
little
settlement
of
prospect
hill
this
proposal
satisfied
everybody
the
evening
was
spent
in
preparing
the
dresses
arms
and
food
which
would
be
required
and
we
retired
early
to
rest
intending
to
be
out
all
day
the
house
was
left
in
good
order
and
we
departed
on
our
expedition
provided
among
other
things
with
spades
and
mattocks
for
i
wished
to
get
young
cocoanut
trees
and
shrubs
of
different
kinds
that
on
our
way
back
we
might
land
on
whale
island
and
begin
our
plantation
there
we
directed
our
course
toward
the
opposite
side
of
the
bay
the
sea
was
smooth
my
rowing
machine
performed
its
work
easily
and
leaving
safety
bay
and
shark
island
behind
us
we
enjoyed
at
our
ease
the
panorama
of
all
the
coast
scenery
landing
near
prospect
hill
we
moored
the
boat
and
walked
through
the
woods
to
our
little
farm
obtaining
some
fresh
cocoanuts
as
well
as
young
plants
on
the
way
before
coming
in
sight
of
the
cottage
at
the
farm
we
heard
the
cocks
crow
and
i
experienced
a
sudden
rush
of
emotion
as
the
sound
recalled
in
a
degree
painfully
vivid
the
recollection
of
many
a
ride
and
walk
at
home
when
we
would
be
greeted
by
just
such
familiar
sounds
as
we
approached
some
kind
friend
house
here
but
for
the
unconscious
animals
utter
solitude
and
silence
prevailed
and
i
with
my
dear
family
whose
visit
would
have
been
hailed
with
delight
in
so
many
homes
advanced
unnoticed
to
this
lonely
cottage
so
long
had
been
our
absence
that
our
arrival
created
a
perfect
panic
the
original
animals
had
forgotten
us
and
to
their
progeny
lambs
kids
and
chickens
who
had
never
seen
the
face
of
man
we
seemed
an
army
of
fierce
foes
the
boys
found
it
impossible
to
milk
the
goats
until
by
the
use
of
the
lasso
they
captured
them
one
after
the
other
bound
their
legs
then
giving
them
salt
to
lick
they
soon
obtained
a
supply
of
excellent
milk
which
was
poured
from
the
cocoanut
shells
they
used
into
calabash
flasks
so
that
we
could
take
with
us
what
was
not
required
at
dinner
the
fowls
were
enticed
by
handfuls
of
grain
and
rice
and
my
wife
caught
as
many
as
she
wished
for
we
were
by
this
time
very
ready
for
dinner
and
the
cold
provisions
we
had
with
us
were
set
forth
the
chief
dish
consisting
of
the
piece
of
whale
tongue
which
by
the
boys
desire
had
been
cooked
with
a
special
view
to
this
entertainment
but
woeful
was
the
disappointment
when
the
tongue
was
tasted
one
after
another
with
dismal
face
pronounced
it
horrid
stuff
begged
for
some
pickled
herring
to
take
away
the
taste
of
and
willingly
bestowed
on
fangs
the
cherished
dainty
fortunately
there
was
a
sufficient
supply
of
other
eatables
and
the
fresh
delicious
cocoanuts
and
goat
milk
put
everyone
in
good
humor
again
while
the
mother
packed
everything
up
fritz
and
i
got
some
shoots
which
i
wished
to
plant
and
then
we
returned
to
the
shore
and
again
embarked
before
returning
to
whale
island
i
felt
a
strong
wish
to
round
cape
disappointment
and
survey
the
coast
immediately
beyond
but
the
promontory
maintained
the
character
of
its
name
and
we
found
that
a
long
sandbank
as
well
as
hidden
reefs
and
rocks
ran
out
a
great
way
into
the
sea
fritz
espying
breakers
ahead
we
put
about
at
once
and
aided
by
a
light
breeze
directed
our
course
toward
whale
island
on
landing
i
began
at
once
to
plant
the
saplings
we
had
brought
the
boys
assisted
me
for
a
while
but
wearied
somewhat
of
the
occupation
and
one
after
another
went
off
in
search
of
shells
and
coral
leaving
their
mother
and
me
to
finish
the
work
presently
jack
came
back
shouting
loudly
father
mother
do
come
and
look
there
is
an
enormous
skeleton
lying
here
the
skeleton
of
some
fearful
great
beast
a
mammoth
i
should
think
why
jack
returned
i
laughing
have
you
forgot
our
old
acquaintance
the
whale
what
else
could
it
be
oh
no
father
it
is
not
the
whale
this
thing
has
not
fish
bones
but
real
good
honest
huge
beast
bones
i
do
know
what
can
have
become
of
the
whale
floated
out
to
sea
most
likely
this
mammoth
is
ever
so
much
bigger
come
and
see
as
i
was
about
to
follow
the
boy
a
voice
from
another
direction
suddenly
cried
father
father
a
great
enormous
turtle
please
make
haste
it
is
waddling
back
to
the
sea
as
hard
as
it
can
go
and
we
ca
stop
it
this
appeal
being
more
pressing
as
well
as
more
important
than
jack
i
snatched
up
an
oar
and
hastened
to
their
assistance
sure
enough
a
large
turtle
was
scrambling
quickly
toward
the
water
and
was
within
a
few
paces
of
it
although
ernest
was
valiantly
holding
on
by
one
of
its
hind
legs
i
sprang
down
the
bank
and
making
use
of
the
oar
as
a
lever
we
succeeded
with
some
difficulty
in
turning
the
creature
on
its
back
it
was
a
huge
specimen
fully
eight
feet
long
and
being
now
quite
helpless
we
left
it
sprawling
and
went
to
inspect
jack
mammoth
skeleton
which
of
course
proved
to
be
neither
more
nor
less
than
that
of
the
whale
i
convinced
him
of
the
fact
by
pointing
out
the
marks
of
our
feet
on
the
ground
and
the
broken
jaws
where
we
had
hacked
out
the
whalebone
what
can
have
made
you
take
up
that
fancy
about
a
mammoth
my
boy
ernest
put
it
into
my
head
father
he
said
there
seemed
to
be
the
skeleton
of
an
antediluvian
monster
there
so
i
ran
to
look
closer
and
i
never
thought
of
the
whale
when
i
saw
no
fish
bones
i
suppose
ernest
was
joking
whales
are
generally
considered
as
fishes
by
those
little
acquainted
with
the
animal
kingdom
but
they
belong
to
the
class
of
mammals
which
comprises
man
the
monkey
tribes
the
bats
the
dogs
and
cats
all
hoofed
animals
whales
and
their
allies
with
other
animals
the
last
on
the
list
being
the
sloth
the
name
by
which
they
are
distinguished
is
derived
from
the
latin
word
a
breast
and
is
given
to
them
because
all
the
species
belonging
to
this
class
are
furnished
with
a
set
of
organs
called
the
mammary
glands
secreting
the
liquid
known
as
milk
by
which
the
young
are
nourished
the
bones
of
the
whale
differ
from
those
of
animals
simply
in
being
of
a
hollow
construction
and
filled
with
air
so
as
to
render
the
carcass
more
buoyant
the
bones
of
birds
are
also
hollow
for
the
same
reason
and
in
all
this
we
see
conspicuously
the
wisdom
and
goodness
of
the
great
creator
what
a
marvelous
structure
it
is
father
said
fritz
what
a
ponderous
mass
of
bones
can
we
not
make
use
of
any
of
them
nothing
strikes
me
at
this
moment
we
will
leave
them
to
bleach
here
yet
awhile
and
perhaps
by
sawing
them
up
afterward
make
a
few
chairs
or
a
reading
desk
for
the
museum
but
now
it
is
time
to
return
home
bring
the
boat
round
to
where
the
turtle
awaits
his
fate
we
must
settle
how
to
deal
with
him
it
was
soon
decided
that
he
must
swim
i
fastened
the
empty
to
a
long
line
one
end
of
which
was
made
fast
to
the
bow
of
the
boat
the
other
carefully
passed
round
the
neck
and
forepaws
of
the
creature
who
was
then
lifted
so
as
to
let
him
regain
his
feet
when
he
instantly
made
for
the
water
plunged
in
the
cask
floated
after
him
and
prevented
his
sinking
we
were
all
on
board
in
a
moment
and
the
worthy
fellow
after
vainly
attempting
to
dive
set
himself
diligently
to
swim
right
forward
towing
us
comfortably
after
him
i
was
ready
to
cut
the
line
on
the
least
appearance
of
danger
and
kept
him
on
the
course
for
safety
bay
by
striking
the
water
with
a
right
or
left
according
as
the
turtle
was
disposed
to
turn
too
much
one
way
or
the
other
the
boys
were
delighted
with
the
fun
and
compared
me
to
neptune
in
his
car
drawn
by
dolphins
and
accompanied
by
amphitrite
and
attendant
tritons
we
landed
safely
at
the
usual
place
near
rockburg
and
the
turtle
was
condemned
and
executed
soon
afterward
the
shell
which
was
quite
eight
feet
long
and
three
broad
was
when
cleaned
and
prepared
to
form
a
trough
for
the
water
supply
at
the
cave
and
the
meat
was
carefully
salted
and
stored
up
for
many
a
good
and
savory
meal
it
had
been
my
intention
to
bring
a
piece
of
land
under
cultivation
before
the
next
rainy
season
to
be
sown
with
different
sorts
of
grain
but
many
unforeseen
circumstances
had
intervened
to
hinder
this
and
our
animals
unaccustomed
to
the
yoke
were
not
available
for
the
plow
i
therefore
gave
up
the
idea
for
the
present
and
applied
myself
with
ernest
assistance
to
completing
the
loom
which
although
the
workmanship
was
clumsy
i
succeeded
in
making
quite
fit
for
use
i
had
fortunately
in
my
younger
days
spent
many
hours
in
the
workshops
of
weavers
and
other
artisans
and
therefore
i
understood
more
than
might
have
been
expected
of
their
various
crafts
paste
or
size
was
required
to
smear
over
the
threads
but
we
could
not
spare
flour
for
such
a
purpose
and
i
used
isinglass
which
kept
the
warp
moist
perfectly
well
and
spared
us
the
necessity
of
setting
up
the
loom
in
a
damp
uncomfortable
place
which
has
often
to
be
done
to
prevent
the
of
the
web
of
this
isinglass
i
also
made
thin
plates
to
be
used
as
they
were
at
least
as
transparent
as
horn
and
when
fixed
deep
in
the
rock
and
beyond
the
reach
of
rain
did
good
service
in
admitting
light
success
encouraging
me
to
persevere
i
next
began
the
spoils
of
the
chase
having
furnished
us
with
plenty
of
leather
with
which
i
covered
light
frames
of
wood
using
the
hairy
moss
or
lichen
for
stuffing
and
ere
long
the
animals
were
equipped
with
saddles
stirrups
bridles
yokes
and
collars
to
the
very
great
satisfaction
of
their
youthful
riders
and
drivers
this
occupation
was
followed
by
a
great
deal
of
work
connected
with
the
annual
return
of
the
herring
shoals
which
now
took
place
to
them
succeeding
as
on
former
occasions
shoals
of
other
fish
and
many
seals
more
than
ever
aware
of
the
value
of
all
these
we
did
not
fail
to
make
good
use
of
our
opportunities
and
captured
large
numbers
the
boys
were
getting
anxious
for
another
shooting
expedition
but
before
undertaking
that
i
wished
to
do
some
as
sacks
were
beginning
to
fail
us
and
there
was
constant
demand
for
baskets
in
which
to
carry
and
keep
our
roots
and
fruits
our
first
attempts
were
clumsy
enough
but
as
usual
perseverance
was
rewarded
and
we
produced
a
good
supply
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
one
very
large
basket
i
furnished
with
openings
through
which
to
pass
a
strong
stick
so
that
it
might
when
heavily
laden
be
carried
by
two
persons
no
sooner
did
the
children
see
the
force
of
this
idea
than
they
got
a
bamboo
and
popping
little
franz
into
the
basket
carried
him
about
in
triumph
this
amusement
suggested
a
fresh
notion
to
fritz
oh
father
cried
he
do
you
think
we
might
make
something
like
this
for
mother
and
carry
her
much
more
comfortably
than
jolting
along
in
the
cart
the
boys
shouted
with
glee
at
the
proposal
and
though
their
mother
thought
the
plan
feasible
enough
she
confessed
that
she
did
not
much
like
the
thought
of
sitting
in
the
middle
of
a
basket
and
just
looking
out
now
and
then
over
the
rim
however
i
assured
her
it
should
be
a
comfortable
or
litter
and
the
next
question
was
how
it
should
be
carried
since
the
boys
could
not
play
the
part
of
indian
either
with
safety
to
their
mother
or
with
any
pleasure
to
themselves
the
bull
and
the
buffalo
cried
jack
why
not
use
them
for
it
go
and
try
them
now
off
ran
the
boys
and
in
a
short
time
the
basket
was
securely
hung
between
storm
and
grumble
fritz
and
jack
sprang
into
their
saddles
and
ernest
very
gingerly
deposited
himself
in
the
cradle
as
franz
called
it
they
set
forth
at
a
most
sober
pace
the
animals
who
were
perfectly
docile
appearing
only
a
little
surprised
at
the
new
arrangement
oh
it
is
so
pleasant
mother
it
is
a
delightful
motion
cried
ernest
as
they
passed
us
it
swings
and
rocks
really
soothingly
quicker
fritz
go
quicker
and
the
trot
pleasing
him
equally
well
the
pace
gradually
quickened
till
the
animals
were
going
along
at
a
rate
which
shook
and
jolted
the
basket
about
most
fearfully
ernest
called
and
screamed
in
vain
for
a
halt
his
brothers
thought
it
capital
fun
to
shake
up
the
professor
and
made
the
circuit
of
the
level
ground
near
rockburg
finally
pulling
up
in
front
of
us
like
performers
stopping
to
receive
the
applause
of
spectators
it
was
impossible
to
help
laughing
the
scene
was
so
ridiculous
but
ernest
was
very
angry
with
his
brothers
his
reproaches
provoked
high
words
in
reply
and
a
quarrel
was
imminent
but
i
interfered
and
showed
them
how
easily
a
joke
carried
too
far
would
lead
to
disputes
and
bad
feeling
urging
them
to
avoid
on
all
occasions
any
breach
of
the
and
brotherly
love
which
was
the
mainstay
of
our
strength
and
happiness
good
humor
was
soon
restored
ernest
himself
helped
to
unharness
the
beasts
and
got
some
handfuls
of
salt
and
barley
to
reward
their
exertions
saying
that
they
must
have
some
more
another
day
i
was
seated
with
my
wife
and
fritz
beneath
the
shade
of
the
veranda
engaged
in
and
chatting
pleasantly
when
suddenly
fritz
got
up
advanced
a
step
or
two
gazing
fixedly
along
the
avenue
which
led
from
jackal
river
then
he
exclaimed
i
see
something
so
strange
in
the
distance
father
what
in
the
world
can
it
be
first
it
seems
to
be
drawn
in
coils
on
the
ground
like
a
cable
then
uprises
as
it
were
a
little
mast
then
that
sinks
and
the
coils
move
along
again
it
is
coming
toward
the
bridge
my
wife
took
alarm
at
this
description
and
calling
the
other
boys
retreated
into
the
cave
where
i
desired
them
to
close
up
the
entrances
and
keep
watch
with
firearms
at
the
upper
windows
these
were
openings
we
had
made
in
the
rock
at
some
elevation
reached
within
by
steps
and
a
kind
of
gallery
which
passed
along
the
front
of
the
rooms
fritz
remained
by
me
while
i
examined
the
object
through
my
spyglass
it
is
as
i
feared
an
enormous
serpent
cried
i
it
advances
directly
this
way
and
we
shall
be
placed
in
the
greatest
possible
danger
for
it
will
cross
the
bridge
to
a
certainty
may
we
not
attack
it
father
exclaimed
the
brave
boy
only
with
the
greatest
caution
returned
i
it
is
far
too
formidable
and
too
tenacious
of
life
for
us
rashly
to
attempt
its
destruction
thank
god
we
are
at
rockburg
where
we
can
keep
in
safe
retreat
while
we
watch
for
an
opportunity
to
destroy
this
frightful
enemy
go
up
to
your
mother
now
and
assist
in
preparing
the
firearms
i
will
join
you
directly
but
i
must
further
observe
the
monster
movements
fritz
left
me
unwillingly
while
i
continued
to
watch
the
serpent
which
was
of
gigantic
size
and
already
much
too
near
the
bridge
to
admit
of
the
possibility
of
removing
that
means
of
access
to
our
dwelling
i
recollected
too
how
easily
it
would
pass
through
the
walls
the
reptile
advanced
with
writhing
and
undulatory
movements
from
time
to
time
rearing
its
head
to
the
height
of
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
and
slowly
turning
it
about
as
though
on
the
lookout
for
prey
as
it
crossed
the
bridge
with
a
slow
suspicious
motion
i
withdrew
and
hastily
rejoined
my
little
party
which
was
preparing
to
garrison
our
fortress
in
warlike
array
but
with
considerable
trepidation
which
my
presence
served
in
a
measure
to
allay
we
placed
ourselves
at
the
upper
openings
after
strongly
barricading
everything
below
and
ourselves
unseen
awaited
with
beating
hearts
the
further
advance
of
the
foe
which
speedily
became
visible
to
us
its
movements
appeared
to
become
uncertain
as
though
puzzled
by
the
trace
of
human
habitation
it
turned
in
different
directions
coiling
and
uncoiling
and
frequently
rearing
its
head
but
keeping
about
the
middle
of
the
space
in
front
of
the
cave
when
suddenly
as
though
unable
to
resist
doing
so
one
after
another
the
boys
fired
and
even
their
mother
discharged
her
gun
the
shots
took
not
the
slightest
effect
beyond
startling
the
monster
whose
movements
were
accelerated
fritz
and
i
also
fired
with
steadier
aim
but
with
the
same
want
of
success
for
the
monster
passing
on
with
a
gliding
motion
entered
the
reedy
marsh
to
the
left
and
entirely
disappeared
a
wonderful
weight
seemed
lifted
from
our
hearts
while
all
eagerly
discussed
the
vast
length
and
awful
though
magnificent
appearance
of
the
serpent
i
had
recognized
it
as
the
boa
constrictor
it
was
a
vast
specimen
upward
of
thirty
feet
in
length
i
explained
to
the
children
that
its
name
in
south
america
is
boaguacu
the
first
syllable
of
that
word
with
the
latin
addition
which
indicates
that
it
kills
its
prey
by
pressure
or
constriction
gives
the
name
by
which
it
is
commonly
known
the
near
neighborhood
of
this
terrific
reptile
occasioned
me
the
utmost
anxiety
and
i
desired
that
no
one
should
leave
the
house
on
any
pretext
whatever
without
my
express
permission
during
three
whole
days
we
were
kept
in
suspense
and
fear
not
daring
to
stir
above
a
few
hundred
steps
from
the
door
although
during
all
that
time
the
enemy
showed
no
sign
of
his
presence
in
fact
we
might
have
been
induced
to
think
the
boa
had
passed
across
the
swamp
and
found
his
way
by
some
cleft
or
chasm
through
the
wall
of
cliffs
beyond
had
not
the
restless
behavior
of
our
geese
and
ducks
given
proof
that
he
still
lurked
in
the
thicket
of
reeds
which
they
were
accustomed
to
make
their
nightly
resting
place
they
swam
anxiously
about
and
with
much
clapping
of
wings
and
disturbed
cackling
showed
their
uneasiness
finally
taking
wing
they
crossed
the
harbor
and
took
up
their
quarters
on
shark
island
my
embarrassment
increased
as
time
passed
on
i
could
not
venture
to
attack
with
insufficient
force
a
monstrous
and
formidable
serpent
concealed
in
dense
thickets
amidst
dangerous
swamps
yet
it
was
dreadful
to
live
in
a
state
of
blockade
cut
off
from
all
the
important
duties
in
which
we
were
engaged
and
shut
up
with
our
animals
in
the
unnatural
light
of
the
cave
enduring
constant
anxiety
and
perturbation
out
of
this
painful
state
we
were
at
last
delivered
by
none
other
than
our
good
old
donkey
not
however
by
the
exercise
of
a
praiseworthy
quality
such
as
the
vigilance
of
the
geese
of
the
capitol
but
by
sheer
stupidity
our
situation
was
rendered
the
more
critical
from
having
no
great
stock
of
provisions
or
fodder
for
the
animals
and
the
hay
failing
us
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
i
determined
to
set
them
at
liberty
by
sending
them
under
the
guidance
of
fritz
across
the
river
at
the
ford
he
was
to
ride
lightfoot
and
they
were
to
be
fastened
together
until
safely
over
next
morning
we
began
to
prepare
for
this
by
tying
them
in
a
line
and
while
so
engaged
my
wife
opened
the
door
when
old
grizzle
who
was
fresh
and
frolicsome
after
the
long
rest
and
regular
feeding
suddenly
broke
away
from
the
halter
cut
some
awkward
capers
then
bolting
out
careered
at
full
gallop
straight
for
the
marsh
in
vain
we
called
him
by
name
fritz
would
even
have
rushed
after
him
had
not
i
held
him
back
in
another
moment
the
ass
was
close
to
the
thicket
and
with
the
cold
shudder
of
horror
we
beheld
the
snake
rear
itself
from
its
lair
the
fiery
eyes
glanced
around
the
dark
deadly
jaws
opened
widely
the
forked
tongue
darted
greedily
forth
poor
grizzle
fate
was
sealed
becoming
aware
on
a
sudden
of
his
danger
he
stopped
short
spread
out
all
four
legs
and
set
up
the
most
piteous
and
discordant
bray
that
ever
wrung
echo
from
rocks
swift
and
straight
as
a
fencer
thrust
the
destroyer
was
upon
him
wound
round
him
entangled
enfolded
compressed
him
all
the
while
cunningly
avoiding
the
convulsive
kicks
of
the
agonized
animal
a
cry
of
horror
arose
from
the
spectators
of
this
miserable
tragedy
shoot
him
father
oh
shoot
him
do
save
poor
grizzle
my
children
it
is
impossible
cried
i
our
old
friend
is
lost
to
us
forever
i
have
hopes
however
that
when
gorged
with
his
prey
we
may
be
able
to
attack
the
snake
with
some
chance
of
success
but
the
horrible
wretch
is
never
going
to
swallow
him
all
at
once
father
cried
jack
that
will
be
too
shocking
snakes
have
no
grinders
but
only
fangs
therefore
they
can
not
chew
their
food
and
must
swallow
it
whole
but
although
the
idea
is
startling
it
is
not
really
more
shocking
than
the
rending
tearing
and
shedding
of
blood
which
occurs
when
the
lions
and
tigers
seize
their
prey
but
said
franz
how
can
the
snake
separate
the
flesh
from
the
bones
without
teeth
and
is
this
kind
of
snake
poisonous
no
dear
child
said
i
only
fearfully
strong
and
ferocious
and
it
has
no
need
to
tear
the
flesh
from
the
bones
it
swallows
them
skin
hair
and
all
and
digests
everything
in
its
stomach
it
seems
utterly
impossible
that
the
broad
ribs
the
strong
legs
hoofs
and
all
should
go
down
that
throat
exclaimed
fritz
only
see
i
replied
how
the
monster
deals
with
his
victim
closer
and
more
tightly
he
curls
his
crushing
folds
the
bones
give
way
he
is
kneading
him
into
a
shapeless
mass
he
will
soon
begin
to
gorge
his
prey
and
slowly
but
surely
it
will
disappear
down
that
distended
maw
the
mother
with
little
franz
found
the
scene
all
too
horrible
and
hastened
into
the
cave
trembling
and
distressed
to
the
rest
of
us
there
seemed
a
fearful
fascination
in
the
dreadful
sight
and
we
could
not
move
from
the
spot
i
expected
that
the
boa
before
swallowing
his
prey
would
cover
it
with
saliva
to
aid
in
the
operation
although
it
struck
me
that
its
very
slender
forked
tongue
was
about
the
worst
possible
implement
for
such
a
purpose
it
was
evident
to
us
however
that
this
popular
idea
was
erroneous
the
act
of
lubricating
the
mass
must
have
taken
place
during
the
process
of
swallowing
certainly
nothing
was
applied
beforehand
this
wonderful
performance
lasted
from
seven
in
the
morning
until
noon
when
the
awkward
morsel
was
entirely
swallowed
the
serpent
lay
stiff
distorted
and
apparently
insensible
along
the
edge
of
the
marsh
i
felt
that
now
or
never
was
the
moment
for
attack
calling
on
my
sons
to
maintain
their
courage
and
presence
of
mind
i
left
our
retreat
with
a
feeling
of
joyous
emotion
quite
new
to
me
and
approached
with
rapid
steps
and
leveled
gun
the
outstretched
form
of
the
serpent
fritz
followed
me
closely
jack
somewhat
timidly
came
several
paces
behind
while
ernest
after
a
little
hesitation
remained
where
he
was
the
monster
body
was
stiff
and
motionless
which
made
its
rolling
and
fiery
eyes
and
the
slow
spasmodic
undulations
of
its
tail
more
fearful
by
contrast
we
fired
together
and
both
balls
entered
the
skull
the
light
of
the
eye
was
extinguished
and
the
only
movement
was
in
the
further
extremity
of
the
body
which
rolled
writhed
coiled
and
lashed
from
side
to
side
advancing
closer
we
fired
our
pistols
directly
into
its
head
a
convulsive
quiver
ran
through
the
mighty
frame
and
the
boa
constrictor
lay
dead
as
we
raised
a
cry
of
victory
jack
desirous
of
a
share
in
the
glory
of
conquest
ran
close
to
the
creature
firing
his
pistol
into
its
side
when
he
was
sent
sprawling
over
and
over
by
a
movement
of
its
tail
excited
to
a
last
galvanic
effort
by
the
shot
being
in
no
way
hurt
he
speedily
recovered
his
feet
and
declared
he
had
given
it
its
quietus
i
hope
the
terrible
noise
you
made
just
now
was
the
signal
of
victory
said
my
wife
drawing
near
with
the
utmost
circumspection
and
holding
franz
tightly
by
the
hand
i
was
half
afraid
to
come
i
assure
you
see
this
dreadful
creature
dead
at
our
feet
and
let
us
thank
god
that
we
have
been
able
to
destroy
such
an
enemy
what
to
be
done
with
him
now
asked
jack
let
us
get
him
stuffed
said
fritz
and
set
him
up
in
the
museum
among
our
shells
and
corals
did
anybody
ever
think
of
eating
serpents
inquired
franz
of
course
not
said
his
mother
why
child
serpents
are
poisonous
it
would
be
very
dangerous
excuse
me
my
dear
wife
said
i
first
of
all
the
boa
is
not
poisonous
and
then
besides
that
the
flesh
of
even
poisonous
snakes
can
be
eaten
without
danger
as
for
instance
the
rattlesnake
from
which
can
be
made
a
strong
and
nourishing
soup
tasting
very
like
good
chicken
broth
of
course
the
cook
must
be
told
to
throw
away
the
head
containing
the
deadly
fangs
it
is
remarkable
that
pigs
do
not
fear
poisonous
snakes
but
can
kill
and
eat
them
without
injury
an
instance
of
this
occurs
to
my
memory
a
vessel
on
lake
superior
in
north
america
was
wrecked
on
a
small
island
abounding
in
rattlesnakes
and
for
that
reason
uninhabited
the
vessel
had
a
cargo
of
live
pigs
the
crew
escaped
to
the
mainland
in
a
boat
but
the
pigs
had
to
be
left
for
some
time
till
the
owner
could
return
to
fetch
them
but
with
the
small
hope
of
finding
many
left
alive
to
his
surprise
the
animals
were
not
only
alive
but
remarkably
fat
and
flourishing
while
not
a
single
rattlesnake
remained
on
the
island
the
pigs
had
clearly
eaten
the
serpents
but
might
not
some
other
cause
have
been
assigned
for
their
disappearance
asked
ernest
suppose
for
example
that
a
great
flight
of
secretary
birds
had
arrived
they
might
have
cleared
the
island
of
rattlesnakes
oh
what
is
a
secretary
bird
interrupted
franz
i
thought
a
secretary
meant
a
man
who
wrote
letters
so
it
does
franz
and
the
bird
ernest
spoke
of
has
curious
long
feathers
projecting
from
either
side
of
its
head
something
like
pens
stuck
behind
a
man
ear
hence
its
name
it
is
perfectly
true
that
it
lives
on
snakes
lizards
toads
and
frogs
but
ernest
i
can
not
give
up
my
pigs
for
in
the
first
place
the
secretary
bird
is
an
inhabitant
of
southern
africa
and
is
never
seen
in
north
america
neither
does
it
ever
fly
in
a
flock
still
so
ravenous
is
its
appetite
that
no
doubt
even
one
or
two
had
they
by
some
miracle
found
themselves
on
lake
superior
would
have
been
able
to
give
a
very
good
account
of
the
deadly
reptiles
and
at
least
shared
in
the
glory
of
their
extermination
my
wife
having
gone
to
prepare
dinner
we
continued
talking
as
we
rested
in
the
shade
of
some
rocks
near
the
serpent
for
a
considerable
time
the
open
air
was
welcome
to
us
after
our
long
imprisonment
and
we
were
besides
desirous
to
drive
off
any
birds
of
prey
who
might
be
attracted
to
the
carcass
which
we
wished
to
preserve
entire
my
boys
questioned
me
closely
on
the
subject
of
serpents
in
general
and
i
described
to
them
the
action
of
the
poison
fangs
how
they
folded
back
on
the
sides
of
the
upper
jaw
and
how
the
glands
and
reservoir
are
found
at
the
back
and
sides
of
the
head
giving
to
the
venomous
serpents
that
peculiar
width
of
head
which
is
so
unfailing
a
characteristic
the
fangs
are
hollow
said
i
and
when
the
creature
bites
the
pressure
forces
down
a
tiny
drop
of
the
liquid
poison
which
enters
the
wound
and
through
the
veins
quickly
spreads
over
the
entire
system
sometimes
if
taken
in
time
cures
are
effected
but
in
most
cases
the
bite
of
a
serpent
is
followed
by
speedy
death
the
children
were
much
interested
in
my
account
of
the
of
india
how
they
fearlessly
handle
the
most
deadly
of
the
serpent
tribe
the
cobra
di
capello
or
hooded
cobra
cause
them
to
move
in
time
to
musical
sounds
from
a
small
pipe
twine
the
reptile
about
their
arms
and
bare
necks
and
then
to
prove
that
the
poison
fangs
have
not
been
removed
make
them
bite
a
fowl
which
soon
dies
from
the
effects
how
is
it
possible
to
extract
the
fangs
father
asked
ernest
no
instrument
is
required
replied
i
i
have
read
the
account
written
by
a
gentleman
in
india
who
saw
a
catch
a
large
cobra
in
the
jungle
and
for
the
purpose
of
removing
the
fangs
hold
up
a
cloth
at
which
the
irritated
snake
flew
and
the
fangs
being
caught
in
it
the
man
seized
the
reptile
by
the
throat
extracted
them
and
then
squeezed
out
the
poison
a
clear
oily
substance
upon
a
leaf
what
does
the
rattle
of
the
rattlesnake
look
like
and
how

it
sound

the
tip
of
the
tail
are
a
number
of
curious
loose
horny
structures
formed
of
the
same
substance
as
the
scales
a
very
good
idea
of
the
structure
of
the
rattle
may
be
formed
by
slipping
a
number
of
thimbles
loosely
into
each
other
the
rattlesnake
lies
coiled
with
its
head
flat
and
the
tip
of
its
tail
elevated
when
alarmed
or
irritated
it
gives
a
quivering
movement
to
the
tail
which
causes
the
joints
of
the
rattle
to
shake
against
each
other
with
a
peculiar
sound
not
easily
described
all
animals
even
horses
newly
brought
from
europe
tremble
at
this
noise
and
try
to
escape
what
is
the
best
thing
to
be
done
for
the
bite
of
a
serpent
inquired
fritz
remedies
are
very
various
very
uncertain
and
differ
with
the
species
inflicting
the

the
use
of

instances
done
wonders

bites
it

plentifully
in
the
hotter

a
mode
of

on

one
of

to

they

blood

it
flows
from

wound

at
last
fall
off
when
the
danger
is
considered
to
be
over
but
now
we
must
leave
this
fertile
subject
of
discussion
and
i
can
only
say
i
sincerely
trust
we
may
never
have
cause
to
resume
it
from
the
appearance
of
another
serpent
here
of
any

you

an

must
afford
him
more
honorable
sepulture
than
he
enjoys
at
present
when
we
proceed
as
we
speedily
must
to
disembowel
his
murderer
ernest
took
the
matter
quite
seriously
and
planting
his
elbows
on
his
knees
he
bent
his
thoughtful
brow
in
his
hands
and
remained
wrapt
in

for

taking
out

used
for
marking

the
lines
were
forthwith
inscribed
on
a
great
flat
stone
being
as
i
told
the
boy
the
very
best
poetry
that
had
ever
been
written
on
our
coast
we
then
had
dinner
and
afterward
went
to
work
with
the
serpent
the
first
operation
was
to
recover
the
mangled
remains
of
the
ass
which
being
effected
he
was
buried
in
the
soft
marshy
ground
close
by
and
the
hole
filled
up
with
fragments
of
rock
then
we
yoked
storm
and
grumble
to
the
serpent
and
dragged
it
to
a
convenient
distance
from
rockburg
where
the
process
of
skinning
stuffing
and
sewing
up
again
afforded
occupation
of
the
deepest
interest
to
the
boys
for
several
days
we
took
great
pains
to
coil
it
round
a
pole
in
the
museum
arranging
the
head
with
the
jaws
wide
open
so
as
to
look
as
alarming
as
possible
and
contriving
to
make
eyes
and
tongue
sufficiently
well
to
represent
nature
in
fact
our
dogs
never
passed
the
monster
without
growling
and
must
have
wondered
at
our
taste
in
keeping
such
a
pet
over
the
entrance
leading
to
the
museum

inscribed

immensely

the
greatest
danger

had

exposed
was
now

there
remained
much
anxiety
in
my
mind

another

unseen

might

summoning
my
sons
to
accompany
me
to
the
marsh
i
found
neither
ernest
nor
jack
very
eager
to
do
so
the
latter
vowing
he
had
the
cold
shivers
each
time
he
thought
how
his
ribs
might
have
been
smashed
by
the
last
flap
of
the
snake
tail
but
i
did
not
yield
to
their
reluctance
and
we
finally
set
about
crossing
the
marsh
by
placing
planks
and
wicker
hurdles
on
the
ground
and
changing
their
places
as
we
advanced
nothing
was
discovered
beyond
tracks
in
the
reeds
and
the
lair
where
the
rushes
grass
and
were
beaten
down
emerging
beyond
the
thicket
we
found
ourselves
on
firm
ground
near
the
precipitous
wall
of
rock
and
perceived
a
clear
sparkling
brook
flowing
from
an
opening
which
proved
to
be
a
cave
or
grotto
of
considerable
size
the
vaulted
roof
was
covered
with
stalactites
while
many
formed
stately
pillars
which
seemed
as
though
supporting
the
roof
the
floor
was
strewn
with
fine
earth
with
a
smooth
soapy
feeling
which
i
felt
convinced
was
fuller
earth
well
this
is
a
pleasant
discovery
said
i
this
is
as
good
as
soap
for
washing
and
will
save
me
the
trouble
of
turning
perceiving
that
the
streamlet
flowed
from
an
opening
of
some
width
in
the
inner
rock
fritz
passed
through
in
order
to
trace
it
to
its
source
presently
shouting
to
me
that
the
opening
widened
very
much
and
begging
me
to
follow
him
i
did
so
leaving
the
other
boys
in
the
outer
cave
and
fired
a
the
reverberating
echoes
of
which
testified
to
the
great
extent
of
the
place
and
lighting
the
bit
of
candle
i
always
carried
with
me
we
advanced
the
light
burning
clear
and
steadily
though
shedding
a
very
feeble
light
in
so
vast
a
space
suddenly
fritz
exclaimed
i
verily
believe
this
is
a
second
cave
of
salt
see
how
the
walls
glance
and
how
the
light
is
reflected
from
the
roof
these
can
not
be
salt
crystals
said
i
the
water
which
flows
over
them
leaves
no
track
and
tastes
quite
sweet
i
am
rather
inclined
to
believe
that
we
have
penetrated
into
a
cave
of
rock
crystal
oh
how
splendid
then
we
have
discovered
a
great
treasure
certainly
if
we
could
make
any
use
of
it
otherwise
in
our
situation
it
is
about
as
valuable
as
the
lump
of
gold
found
by
good
old
robinson
crusoe
anyhow
i
will
break
off
a
piece
for
a
specimen
see
here
is
a
fine
bit
only
rather
dull
and
not
transparent
what
a
pity
i
must
knock
off
another
you
must
go
more
carefully
to
work
or
it
will
look
as
dull
as
the
first
you
destroyed
its
true
form
which
is
that
of
a
pyramid
with
six
sides
or
faces
we
remained
some
time
in
this
interesting
grotto
but
our
light
burnt
low
after
we
had
examined
it
in
different
directions
and
fritz
having
secured
a
large
lump
which
exhibited
several
crystals
in
perfection
we
quitted
the
place
fritz
discharging
a
farewell
shot
for
the
sake
of
hearing
the
grand
echoes
on
reaching
the
open
air
we
saw
poor
jack
sobbing
bitterly
but
as
soon
as
we
appeared
he
ran
joyfully
toward
us
and
threw
himself
into
my
arms
my
child
what
is
the
matter
i
cried
anxiously
oh
i
thought
you
were
lost
i
heard
a
noise
twice
as
if
the
rocks
had
shattered
down
and
i
thought
you
and
fritz
were
crushed
in
the
ruins
it
was
horrible
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
i
comforted
the
child
and
explained
the
noises
he
had
heard
inquiring
why
he
was
alone
ernest
is
over
there
among
the
reeds
i
daresay
he
did
not
hear
the
shots
i
found
ernest
busily
engaged
in
weaving
a
basket
in
which
to
catch
fish
he
had
devised
it
ingeniously
with
a
entrance
through
which
the
fish
passing
would
not
easily
find
their
way
out
but
would
remain
swimming
about
in
the
wide
part
of
the
apparatus
i
shot
a
young
serpent
while
you
were
away
father
said
he
it
lies
there
covered
with
rushes
it
is
nearly
four
feet
long
and
as
thick
as
my
arm
a
serpent
cried
i
hurrying
toward
it
in
alarm
and
fearing
there
must
be
a
brood
of
them
in
the
swamp
after
all
a
fine
large
eel
you
mean
my
boy
this
will
provide
an
excellent
supper
for
us
i
am
glad
you
had
the
courage
to
kill
it
instead
of
taking
to
your
heels
and
fleeing
from
the
supposed
serpent
well
i
thought
it
would
be
so
horrid
to
be
pursued
and
caught
that
i
preferred
facing
it
my
shot
took
effect
but
it
was
very
difficult
to
kill
the
creature
outright
it
moved
about
although
its
head
was
smashed
the
tenacity
of
life
possessed
by
eels
is
very
remarkable
i
said
i
have
heard
that
the
best
mode
of
killing
them
is
to
grasp
them
by
the
neck
and
slap
their
tails
smartly
against
a
stone
or
post
we
made
our
way
back
more
easily
by
keeping
close
to
the
cliffs
where
the
ground
was
firmer
and
found
the
mother
washing
clothes
at
the
fountain
she
rejoiced
greatly
at
our
safe
return
and
was
much
pleased
with
the
supply
of
fuller
earth
as
she
said
there
was
now
very
little
soap
left
the
eel
was
cooked
for
supper
and
during
the
evening
a
full
account
was
given
of
our
passage
through
the
swamp
and
discovery
of
the
cavern
it
was
most
important
to
ascertain
whether
any
serpent
lurked
among
the
woods
of
our
little
territory
between
the
cliffs
and
the
sea
preparations
were
set
on
foot
for
the
second
and
greater
undertaking
of
a
search
throughout
the
country
beyond
the
river
as
far
as
the
gap
i
wished
all
the
family
to
go
on
the
expedition
a
decision
which
gave
universal
satisfaction
intending
to
be
engaged
in
this
search
for
several
weeks
we
took
the
small
tent
and
a
store
of
all
sorts
of
necessary
provisions
as
well
as
firearms
tools
cooking
utensils
and
torches
all
these
things
were
packed
on
the
cart
which
was
drawn
by
storm
and
grumble
jack
and
franz
mounted
them
and
acted
at
once
the
part
of
riders
and
drivers
my
wife
sat
comfortably
in
the
cart
fritz
rode
in
advance
while
ernest
and
i
walked
we
were
protected
in
flank
by
the
dogs
and
fangs
the
tame
jackal
directing
our
course
toward
woodlands
we
saw
many
traces
of
the
serpent
approach
to
rockburg
in
some
places
where
the
soil
was
loose
the
trail
like
a
broad
furrow
was
very
evident
indeed
at
falconhurst
we
made
a
halt
and
were
as
usual
welcomed
by
the
poultry
as
well
as
by
the
sheep
and
goats
we
then
passed
on
to
woodlands
where
we
arrived
at
nightfall
all
was
peaceful
and
in
good
order
no
track
of
the
boa
in
that
direction
no
signs
of
visits
from
mischievous
apes
the
little
farm
and
its
inhabitants
looked
most
flourishing
next
day
was
passed
in
making
a
survey
of
the
immediate
neighborhood
at
the
same
time
collecting
a
quantity
of
cotton
which
was
wanted
for
new
pillows
and
cushions
in
the
afternoon
franz
was
my
companion
carrying
a
small
gun
intrusted
to
him
for
the
first
time
we
took
fan
and
bruno
with
us
and
went
slowly
along
the
left
bank
of
the
lake
winding
our
way
among
reedy
thickets
which
frequently
turned
us
aside
a
considerable
distance
from
the
water
the
dogs
hunted
about
in
all
directions
and
raised
duck
snipe
and
heron
these
usually
flew
directly
across
the
lake
so
that
franz
got
no
chance
of
a
shot
he
began
to
get
rather
impatient
and
proposed
firing
at
the
black
swans
we
saw
sailing
gracefully
on
the
glassy
surface
of
the
lake
just
then
a
harsh
booming
sound
struck
our
ears
i
paused
in
wonder
as
to
whence
the
noise
proceeded
while
franz
exclaimed
oh
father
can
that
be
swift
our
young
onager
it
can
not
possibly
be
swift
said
i
adding
after
listening
attentively
a
minute
or
two
i
am
inclined
to
think
it
must
be
the
cry
of
a
bittern
a
fine
handsome
bird
of
the
nature
of
a
heron
oh
may
i
shoot
it
father
but
i
wonder
how
a
bird
can
make
that
roaring
noise
one
would
think
it
was
an
ox
it
is
more
like
lowing
than
braying
the
noise
creatures
make
depends
more
on
the
construction
of
the
windpipe
its
relation
to
the
lungs
and
the
strength
of
the
muscles
which
force
out
the
breath
than
on
their
size
as
for
example
how
loud
is
the
song
of
the
nightingale
and
the
little
canary
bird
some
people
say
that
the
bittern
booms
with
his
long
bill
partly
thrust
into
the
boggy
ground
which
increases
the
hollow
muffled
sound
of
its
very
peculiar
cry
franz
was
very
anxious
that
the
first
trophy
of
his
gun
should
be
so
rare
a
bird
as
the
bittern
the
dogs
were
sent
into
the
wood
and
we
waited
some
distance
apart
in
readiness
to
fire
all
at
once
there
was
a
great
rustling
in
the
thicket
franz
fired
and
i
heard
his
happy
voice
calling
out
i
hit
him
i
hit
him
what
have
you
hit
shouted
i
in
return
a
wild
pig
said
he
but
bigger
than
fritz
aha
i
see
you
remember
the
agouti
perhaps
it
is
not
a
hog
at
all
but
one
of
our
little
pigs
from
the
farm
what
will
the
old
sow
say
to
you
franz
i
soon
joined
my
boy
and
found
him
in
transports
of
joy
over
an
animal
certainly
very
much
like
a
pig
although
its
snout
was
broad
and
blunt
it
was
covered
with
bristles
had
no
tail
and
in
color
was
a
yellowish
gray
examining
it
carefully
and
noticing
its
webb
feet
and
its
curious
teeth
i
decided
that
it
must
be
a
capybara
a
animal
of
south
america
and
franz
was
overjoyed
to
find
that
he
had
shot
a
new
creature
as
he
said
it
was
difficult
to
carry
it
home
but
he
very
sensibly
proposed
that
we
should
open
and
clean
the
carcass
which
would
make
it
lighter
and
then
putting
it
in
a
game
bag
he
carried
it
till
quite
tired
out
he
then
asked
if
i
thought
bruno
would
let
him
strap
it
on
his
back
we
found
the
dog
willing
to
bear
the
burden
and
reached
woodlands
soon
afterward
there
we
were
surprised
to
see
ernest
surrounded
by
a
number
of
large
rats
which
lay
dead
on
the
ground
where
can
all
these
have
come
from
exclaimed
i
have
you
and
your
mother
been
instead
of
gathering
rice
as
you
intended
we
came
upon
these
creatures
quite
unexpectedly
he
replied
while
in
the
rice
swamp
knips
who
was
with
us
sprang
away
to
a
kind
of
mound
among
the
reeds
and
pounced
upon
something
which
tried
to
escape
into
a
hole
he
chattered
and
gnashed
his
teeth
and
the
creature
hissed
and
squeaked
and
running
up
i
found
he
had
got
a
big
rat
by
the
tail
he
would
not
let
go
and
the
rat
could
not
turn
in
the
narrow
entrance
to
bite
him
but
i
soon
pulled
it
out
and
killed
it
with
my
stick
the
mound
was
a
curious
looking
erection
so
i
broke
it
open
with
some
difficulty
and
in
doing
this
dislodged
quite
a
dozen
of
the
creatures
some
i
killed
but
many
plunged
into
the
water
and
escaped
on
examining
their
dwelling
i
found
it
a
vaulted
tunnel
made
of
clay
and
mud
and
thickly
lined
with
sedges
rushes
and
leaves
there
were
other
mounds
or
lodges
close
by
and
seeking
an
entrance
to
one
i
stretched
my
game
bag
across
it
and
then
hammered
on
the
roof
till
a
whole
lot
of
rats
sprang
out
several
right
into
the
bag
i
hit
away
right
and
left
but
began
to
repent
of
my
audacity
when
i
found
the
whole
community
swarming
about
in
the
wildest
excitement
some
escaping
but
many
stopping
in
bewilderment
while
others
actually
attacked
me
it
was
anything
but
pleasant
i
assure
you
and
i
began
to
think
of
bishop
hatto
in
the
mouse
tower
on
the
rhine
knips
liked
it
as
little
as
i
did
and
skipped
about
desperately
to
get
out
of
their
way
though
he
now
and
then
seized
a
rat
by
the
neck
in
his
teeth
just
as
i
began
to
shout
for
help
juno
came
dashing
through
the
reeds
and
water
and
made
quick
work
with
the
enemy
all
flying
from
her
attack
my
mother
had
great
difficulty
in
forcing
her
way
through
the
marsh
to
the
scene
of
action
but
reached
me
at
last
and
we
collected
all
the
slain
to
show
you
and
for
the
sake
of
their
skins
this
account
excited
my
curiosity
and
i
went
to
examine
the
place
ernest
described
where
i
found
to
my
surprise
an
arrangement
much
like
a
beaver
dam
though
on
a
small
scale
and
less
complete
you
have
discovered
a
colony
of
beaver
rats
said
i
to
ernest
so
called
from
their
resemblance
in
skill
and
manner
of
life
to
that
wonderful
creature
muskrat
musquash
and
ondatra
are
other
names
given
to
them
they
have
you
see
webbed
feet
and
flattened
tails
and
we
shall
find
that
they
carry
two
small
glands
containing
the
scented
substance
called
musk
the
sooner
we
strip
off
the
skins
the
better
they
will
be
useful
for
making
caps
we
went
back
to
the
house
and
met
fritz
and
jack
just
returned
from
their
excursion
reporting
that
no
trace
of
serpents
great
or
small
had
been
met
with
jack
carried
in
his
hat
about
a
dozen
eggs
and
fritz
had
shot
a
couple
of
heath
fowls
a
cock
and
hen
we
sat
down
to
supper
franz
eager
to
partake
of
his
capybara
even
he
himself
made
a
face
at
the
peculiar
flavor
of
the
meat
it
is
the
musk
which
you
taste
said
i
and
i
described
to
them
the
various
animals
in
which
this
strange
liquid
is
found
the
musk
deer
musk
ox
crocodile
muskrat
of
india
also
called
soudeli
which
taints
a
corked
bottle
of
wine
if
it
only
runs
across
it
concluding
with
an
account
of
the
civet
called
also
the
civet
said
i
is
a
handsome
black
and
white
animal
and
the
perfume
obtained
from
it
was
formerly
considered
a
valuable
medicine
in
the
present
day
it
is
used
chiefly
as
a
scent
this
odoriferous
substance
is
secreted
formed
in
a
double
glandular
pouch
near
the
tail
and
the
dutch
keep
the
creature
in
captivity
so
that
it
shall
afford
them
a
continual
supply
the
method
of
removing
the
civet
perfume
is
ingenious
the
animal
is
very
quick
and
elastic
in
its
movements
and
having
sharp
teeth
it
is
not
pleasant
to
handle
so
it
is
put
into
a
long
narrow
cage
in
which
it
can
not
turn
round
a
horn
spoon
is
then
introduced
and
the
perfume
a
thick
oily
stuff
something
like
butter
is
coolly
scraped
from
the
pouch
the
plundered
civet
being
then
released
from
strait
durance
until
the
supply
is
presently
jack
ran
for
his
game
bag
producing
some
fruit
which
he
had
forgotten
several
pale
green
apples
quite
new
to
us
excited
general
attention
why
what
are
those
are
they
good
i
asked
i
hope
so
for
we
sadly
want
something
to
take
away
the
taste
of
franz
beast
said
jack
but
fritz
and
i
were
afraid
of
eating
some
awful
poison
or
other
like
the
manchineel
so
we
brought
them
for
the
inspection
of
the
learned
master
knips
i
took
one
and
cut
it
in
two
remarking
that
it
contained
a
circle
of
seeds
or
pips
instead
of
the
stone
of
the
manchineel
at
that
moment
knips
slyly
came
behind
me
and
snatching
up
began
to
munch
it
with
the
liveliest
satisfaction
an
example
which
the
boys
were
so
eager
to
follow
that
a
general
scramble
ensued
and
i
had
some
trouble
in
securing
a
couple
of
the
apples
for
myself
and
their
mother
i
imagined
this
to
be
the
cinnamon
apple
of
the
antilles
everyone
seeming
wearied
by
the
fatigues
of
the
day
our
mattresses
and
pillows
were
arranged
and
the
inmates
of
woodlands
betook
themselves
to
repose
with
early
light
we
commenced
the
next
day
journey
directing
our
course
to
a
point
between
the
and
the
gap
where
we
had
once
made
a
sort
of
arbor
of
the
branches
of
trees
as
this
remained
in
pretty
good
condition
we
spread
a
sailcloth
over
the
top
of
it
instead
of
pitching
the
tent
and
made
it
very
comfortable
quarters
for
the
short
time
i
proposed
to
stay
there
our
object
being
to
search
the
neighborhood
for
traces
of
the
boa
constrictor
or
any
of
his
kindred
fritz
jack
and
franz
went
with
me
to
the
brake
and
we
satisfied
ourselves
that
our
enemy
had
not
been
there
it
was
long
since
we
had
enjoyed
the
fresh
juice
of
these
canes
and
we
were
refreshing
ourselves
therewith
when
a
loud
barking
of
dogs
and
loud
rustling
and
rattling
through
the
thicket
of
canes
disturbed
our
pleasant
occupation
and
as
we
could
see
nothing
a
yard
off
where
we
stood
i
hurried
to
the
open
ground
and
with
guns
in
readiness
we
awaited
what
was
coming
in
a
few
minutes
a
herd
of
creatures
like
little
pigs
issued
from
the
thicket
and
made
off
in
single
file
at
a
brisk
trot
they
were
of
a
uniform
gray
color
and
showed
short
sharp
tusks
my
trusty
speedily
laid
low
two
of
the
fugitives
the
others
continued
to
follow
the
leader
in
line
scarcely
turning
aside
to
pass
the
dead
bodies
of
their
comrades
and
maintaining
the
same
steady
pace
although
fritz
and
jack
also
fired
and
killed
several
i
felt
certain
that
these
were
peccaries
and
recollected
that
an
odoriferous
gland
in
the
back
must
be
removed
immediately
otherwise
the
meat
will
become
tainted
and
quite
unfit
to
eat
this
operation
with
the
help
of
my
boys
i
accordingly
performed
at
once
presently
hearing
shots
in
the
direction
of
the
hut
where
we
had
left
ernest
and
his
mother
i
sent
jack
to
their
assistance
desiring
him
to
fetch
the
cart
that
the
booty
might
be
conveyed
to
our
encampment
employing
the
time
of
his
absence
in
opening
and
cleaning
the
animals
thus
reducing
their
weight
ernest
came
back
with
jack
and
the
cart
and
told
us
that
the
procession
of
peccaries
had
passed
near
the
hut
and
that
he
with
juno
help
had
secured
three
of
them
i
was
glad
to
hear
this
as
i
had
determined
to
cure
a
good
supply
of
hams
and
we
made
haste
to
load
the
cart
the
boys
adorned
it
with
flowers
and
green
boughs
and
with
songs
of
triumph
which
made
the
woods
ring
they
conveyed
the
valuable
supply
of
game
to
the
hut
where
their
mother
anxiously
waited
for
us
after
dinner
we
set
to
work
upon
our
pigs
singeing
and
scalding
off
the
bristles
i
cut
out
the
hams
divided
the
flitches
bestowed
considerable
portions
of
the
carcass
on
the
dogs
and
diligently
cleansed
and
salted
the
meat
while
the
boys
prepared
a
shed
where
it
was
to
be
hung
to
be
cured
in
the
smoke
of
fires
of
green
wood
this
unexpected
business
of
course
detained
us
in
the
place
for
some
time
on
the
second
day
when
the
smoking
shed
was
ready
the
boys
were
anxious
to
cook
the
smallest
porker
in
the
otaheitian
fashion
for
this
purpose
they
dug
a
hole
in
which
they
burned
a
quantity
of
dry
grass
sticks
and
weeds
heating
stones
which
were
placed
round
the
sides
of
the
pit
while
the
younger
boys
made
ready
the
oven
fritz
singed
and
washed
his
peccary
stuffing
it
with
potatoes
onions
and
herbs
and
a
good
sprinkling
of
salt
and
pepper
he
then
sewed
up
the
opening
and
enveloped
the
pig
in
large
leaves
to
guard
it
from
the
ashes
and
dust
of
its
the
fire
no
longer
blazed
but
the
embers
and
stones
were
glowing
hot
the
pig
was
carefully
placed
in
the
hole
covered
over
with
hot
ashes
and
the
hole
with
earth
so
that
it
looked
like
a
big
mole
heap
dinner
was
looked
forward
to
with
curiosity
as
well
as
appetite
my
wife
as
usual
distrusting
our
experiments
was
not
sanguine
of
success
and
made
ready
some
plain
food
as
a
she
was
well
pleased
with
the
which
was
roomy
enough
to
hang
all
our
hams
and
bacon
on
a
wide
hearth
in
the
middle
we
kindled
a
large
fire
which
was
kept
constantly
smoldering
by
heaping
it
with
damp
grass
and
green
wood
the
hut
being
closed
in
above
the
smoke
filled
it
and
penetrated
the
meat
thoroughly
this
process
it
had
to
undergo
for
several
days
in
a
few
hours
fritz
gave
notice
that
he
was
going
to
open
his
oven
great
excitement
prevailed
as
he
removed
the
earth
turf
and
stones
and
a
delicious
appetizing
odor
arose
from
the
opening
it
was
the
smell
of
roast
pork
certainly
but
with
a
flavor
of
spices
which
surprised
me
until
i
thought
of
the
leaves
in
which
the
food
had
been
wrapped
the
peccary
was
carefully
raised
and
when
a
few
cinders
were
picked
off
it
looked
a
remarkably
dish
fritz
was
highly
complimented
on
his
success
even
by
his
mother
the
scented
leaves
were
i
thought
those
of
a
tree
which
i
knew
to
be
found
in
madagascar
called
by
the
natives
ravensara
or
good
leaf
it
is
said
to
combine
the
scent
of
the
nutmeg
clove
and
cinnamon
the
fruit
is
a
species
of
nut
possessing
the
scent
of
the
leaves
in
a
more
delicate
degree
and
from
it
an
oil
or
essence
is
distilled
which
is
highly
valued
in
native
cookery
during
the
process
of
curing
our
large
supply
of
hams
and
bacon
which
occupied
several
days
we
roamed
about
the
neighborhood
in
all
directions
finding
no
trace
of
the
serpent
but
making
many
valuable
acquisitions
among
which
were
some
gigantic
bamboos
from
fifty
to
sixty
feet
in
length
and
of
proportionate
thickness
these
when
cut
across
near
the
joints
formed
capital
casks
tubs
and
pots
while
the
long
sharp
thorns
which
begirt
the
stem
at
intervals
were
as
strong
and
useful
as
iron
nails
one
day
we
made
an
excursion
to
the
farm
at
prospect
hill
and
were
grievously
provoked
to
find
that
the
vagabond
apes
had
been
there
and
wrought
terrible
mischief
as
before
at
woodlands
the
animals
and
poultry
were
scattered
and
everything
in
the
cottage
so
torn
and
dirtied
that
it
was
vain
to
think
of
setting
things
right
that
day
we
therefore
very
unwillingly
left
the
disorder
as
we
found
it
purposing
to
devote
time
to
the
work
afterward
when
all
was
in
readiness
for
the
prosecution
of
our
journey
we
closed
and
barricaded
the
hut
in
which
for
the
present
we
left
the
store
of
bacon
and
arranging
our
march
in
the
usual
patriarchal
style
we
took
our
way
to
the
gap
the
thorough
defense
of
which
defile
was
the
main
object
we
had
in
view
our
last
being
much
enclosed
by
shrubs
bamboos
and
brushwood
we
had
during
our
stay
opened
a
path
through
the
cane
thicket
in
the
direction
we
were
about
to
travel
this
we
now
found
of
the
greatest
assistance
and
the
loaded
cart
passed
on
without
impediment
the
ground
was
open
and
tolerably
level
beyond
so
that
in
a
few
hours
we
arrived
at
the
extreme
limit
of
our
coast
territory
we
halted
on
the
outskirts
of
a
little
wood
behind
which
to
the
right
rose
the
precipitous
and
frowning
cliffs
of
the
mountain
gorge
while
to
the
left
flowed
the
torrent
leaving
between
it
and
the
rocks
the
narrow
pass
we
called
the
gap
and
passing
onward
to
mingle
its
water
with
the
sea
the
wood
afforded
us
pleasant
shelter
and
standing
high
and
within
gunshot
of
the
mouth
of
the
rocky
pass
i
resolved
to
make
it
our
camping
place
we
therefore
unpacked
the
cart
and
made
our
usual
arrangements
for
safety
and
comfort
not
forgetting
to
examine
the
wood
itself
so
as
to
ascertain
whether
it
harbored
any
dangerous
animals
nothing
worse
than
wild
cats
was
discovered
we
disturbed
several
of
these
creatures
in
their
pursuit
of
birds
and
small
game
but
they
fled
at
our
approach
by
the
time
dinner
was
ready
we
felt
much
fatigued
and
some
hours
of
unusually
sultry
and
oppressive
heat
compelled
us
to
rest
until
toward
evening
when
returning
coolness
revived
our
strength
we
pitched
the
tent
and
then
occupied
ourselves
with
preparations
for
the
next
day
when
it
was
my
intention
to
penetrate
the
country
beyond
the
defile
and
make
a
longer
excursion
across
the
savannah
than
had
yet
been
undertaken
all
was
ready
for
a
start
at
an
early
hour
my
brave
wife
consented
to
remain
in
camp
with
franz
as
her
companion
while
the
three
elder
boys
and
all
the
dogs
except
juno
went
with
me
we
expected
to
find
it
somewhat
difficult
to
make
our
way
through
the
narrowest
part
of
the
pass
which
had
been
so
strongly
barricaded
and
planted
with
thorny
shrubs
but
found
on
the
contrary
that
the
fences
and
walls
were
broken
down
and
disarranged
it
was
thus
very
evident
that
the
great
snake
as
well
as
the
herd
of
peccaries
had
made
an
entrance
here
this
barricade
was
the
first
check
that
had
been
placed
by
hand
of
man
upon
the
wild
free
will
of
nature
in
this
lonely
place
with
one
consent
storms
floods
torrents
and
the
wild
beasts
of
the
forest
had
set
themselves
to
destroy
it
we
resolved
to
make
the
defenses
doubly
strong
being
convinced
that
the
position
was
capable
of
being
barricaded
and
fortified
so
as
to
resist
the
invaders
we
dreaded
the
prospect
which
opened
before
us
on
emerging
from
the
rocky
pass
was
wide
and
varied
swelling
hills
and
verdant
wooded
vales
were
seen
on
one
hand
while
a
great
plain
stretched
before
us
extending
from
the
banks
of
the
river
toward
a
chain
of
lofty
mountains
whose
summits
were
rendered
indistinct
in
the
haze
of
the
distance
we
crossed
the
stream
which
we
named
east
river
filling
our
flasks
with
water
and
it
was
well
we
did
so
for
in
continuing
our
journey
we
found
the
soil
become
more
arid
and
parched
than
we
had
expected
in
fact
we
soon
appeared
surrounded
by
a
desert
the
boys
were
astonished
at
the
altered
appearance
of
the
country
part
of
which
had
been
explored
when
we
met
with
the
buffaloes
i
reminded
them
of
the
difference
of
the
season
that
the
expedition
had
been
made
directly
after
the
rains
when
vegetation
had
clothed
with
transient
beauty
this
region
which
possessing
no
source
of
moisture
itself
had
become
scathed
and
bare
during
the
blazing
heat
of
summer
our
march
proceeded
slowly
and
many
were
the
uncomplimentary
remarks
made
on
the
new
country
it
was
arabia
petrea
groaned
one
desert
of
sahara
sighed
another
fit
abode
for
demons
muttered
a
third
subterranean
volcanic
fires
are
raging
beneath
our
feet
patience
my
good
fellows
cried
i
you
are
too
easily
discouraged
look
beyond
the
toilsome
way
to
those
grand
mountains
whose
spurs
are
already
stretching
forward
to
meet
us
who
knows
what
pleasant
surprises
await
us
amid
their
steep
declivities
i
for
my
part
expect
to
find
water
fresh
grass
trees
and
a
lovely
we
were
all
glad
to
repose
beneath
the
shade
of
the
first
rock
we
came
to
although
by
pressing
further
upward
we
might
have
attained
to
a
pleasanter
spot
looking
back
toward
the
gap
we
marked
the
strange
contrast
of
the
smiling
country
bordering
the
river
and
the
dreary
monotonous
plain
we
had
traversed
after
gazing
on
the
distant
scene
we
produced
our
store
of
provisions
and
were
busily
engaged
when
knips
our
constant
companion
suddenly
began
to
snuff
and
smell
about
in
a
very
ridiculous
way
finally
with
a
shriek
which
we
knew
was
expressive
of
pleasure
he
set
off
at
full
speed
followed
by
all
the
dogs
up
a
sort
of
glen
behind
us
we
left
them
to
their
own
devices
being
far
too
pleasantly
engaged
with
our
refreshments
to
care
much
what
fancy
the
little
rogue
had
got
in
his
head
when
hunger
was
somewhat
appeased
fritz
once
more
cast
his
eyes
over
the
expanse
of
plain
before
us
and
after
looking
fixedly
for
a
moment
exclaimed
is
it
possible
that
i
see
a
party
of
horsemen
riding
at
full
gallop
toward
us
can
they
be
wild
arabs
of
the
desert
arabs
my
boy
certainly
not
but
take
the
spyglass
and
make
them
out
exactly
we
shall
have
to
be
on
our
guard
whatever
they
are
i
can
not
see
distinctly
enough
to
be
sure
said
he
presently
and
imagination
supplies
the
deficiency
of
sight
in
most
strange
fashion
i
could
fancy
them
wild
cattle
loaded
carts
wandering
haycocks
in
fact
almost
anything
i
like
the
spyglass
passed
from
hand
to
hand
jack
and
ernest
agreed
in
thinking
the
moving
objects
were
men
on
horseback
but
when
it
came
to
my
turn
to
look
i
at
once
pronounced
them
to
be
very
large
ostriches
this
is
fortunate
indeed
i
exclaimed
we
must
try
to
secure
one
of
these
magnificent
birds
the
feathers
alone
are
worth
having
a
live
ostrich
father
that
would
be
splendid
why
we
might
ride
upon
him
as
the
ostriches
approached
we
began
to
consider
in
what
way
we
should
attempt
a
capture
i
sent
fritz
and
jack
to
recall
the
dogs
and
placed
myself
with
ernest
behind
some
shrubs
which
would
conceal
us
from
the
birds
as
they
came
onward
the
boys
did
not
rejoin
us
for
some
little
time
they
found
knips
and
the
dogs
at
a
pool
of
water
formed
by
a
small
mountain
stream
which
the
monkey
instinct
had
detected
his
sudden
departure
was
thus
accounted
for
and
they
availed
themselves
right
gladly
of
his
discovery
filling
their
flasks
and
hastily
bathing
before
their
return
the
ostriches
continued
to
come
in
our
direction
varying
their
pace
as
though
in
sport
springing
trotting
galloping
and
chasing
each
other
round
and
round
so
that
their
approach
was
by
no
means
rapid
i
could
now
perceive
that
of
the
five
birds
one
only
was
a
male
the
white
plumes
of
the
wings
and
tail
contrasting
finely
with
the
deep
glossy
black
of
the
neck
and
body
the
color
of
the
females
being
ashen
brown
the
effect
of
their
white
plumes
was
not
so
handsome
i
do
not
believe
we
shall
have
a
chance
with
these
birds
said
i
except
by
sending
fritz
eagle
in
pursuit
and
for
that
we
must
bide
our
time
and
let
them
come
as
near
as
possible
in
what
way
then
are
ostriches
caught
by
the
natives
of
the
african
deserts
inquired
fritz
sometimes
by
chase
on
horseback
but
their
speed
is
so
very
great
that
even
that
must
be
conducted
by
stratagem
when
these
birds
are
pursued
they
will
run
for
hours
in
a
wide
circle
the
hunter
gallops
after
them
but
describes
a
much
smaller
circle
and
can
therefore
maintain
the
pace
for
a
longer
time
waiting
to
make
the
attack
until
the
bird
is
fatigued
among
the
bushmen
the
hunter
sometimes
envelopes
himself
in
the
skin
of
an
ostrich
his
legs
doing
duty
for
those
of
the
bird
and
his
arm
managing
the
head
and
neck
so
as
to
imitate
the
movements
of
the
bird
when
feeding
the
enterprising
hunter
is
thus
enabled
to
get
among
a
flock
of
ostriches
and
to
shoot
them
with
arrows
one
after
another
when
aware
of
an
enemy
they
defend
themselves
desperately
using
their
powerful
legs
as
weapons
always
kicking
forward
and
inflicting
dreadful
injuries
on
dogs
and
even
on
men
if
attacked
without
due
precaution
but
let
us
take
up
our
positions
and
keep
perfectly
still
for
the
ostriches
are
at
hand
we
held
the
dogs
concealed
as
much
as
possible
the
stately
birds
suddenly
perceiving
us
paused
hesitated
and
appeared
uneasy
yet
as
no
movement
was
made
they
drew
a
few
steps
nearer
with
outstretched
necks
examining
curiously
the
unwonted
spectacle
before
them
the
dogs
became
impatient
struggled
from
our
grasp
and
furiously
rushed
toward
our
astonished
visitors
in
an
instant
they
turned
and
fled
with
the
speed
of
the
wind
their
feet
seemed
not
to
touch
the
ground
their
wings
aiding
the
marvelously
rapid
progress
in
a
few
moments
they
would
have
been
beyond
our
reach
but
as
they
turned
to
fly
the
eagle
was
unhooded
singling
out
the
male
bird
the
falcon
made
his
fatal
swoop
and
piercing
the
skull
the
magnificent
creature
was
laid
low
before
we
could
reach
the
spot
the
dogs
had
joined
the
bird
of
prey
and
were
fiercely
tearing
the
flesh
and
bedabbling
the
splendid
plumes
with
gore
this
sight
grieved
us
what
a
pity
we
could
not
capture
this
glorious
bird
alive
exclaimed
fritz
as
we
took
its
beautiful
feathers
it
must
i
am
sure
have
stood
more
than
six
feet
high
and
two
of
us
might
have
mounted
him
at
once
in
the
vast
sandy
deserts
where
nothing
grows
what
can
flocks
of
these
birds
find
to
live
upon
inquired
ernest
that
would
indeed
be
hard
to
say
if
the
deserts
were
utterly
barren
and
unfruitful
returned
i
but
over
these
sandy
wastes
a
beneficent
providence
scatters
plants
of
wild
melons
which
absorb
and
retain
every
drop
of
moisture
and
which
quench
the
thirst
as
well
as
satisfy
the
hunger
of
the
ostriches
and
other
inhabitants
of
the
wilds
these
melons
however
do
not
constitute
his
entire
diet
he
feeds
freely
on
grasses
dates
and
hard
grain
when
he
can
obtain
them
does
the
ostrich
utter
any
cry
the
voice
of
the
ostrich
is
a
deep
hollow
rumbling
sound
so
much
resembling
the
roar
of
the
lion
as
occasionally
to
be
mistaken
for
it
but
what
does
jack
mean
by
waving
his
cap
and
beckoning
in
that
excited
fashion
what
has
the
boy
found
i
wonder
he
ran
a
little
way
toward
us
shouting
eggs
father
ostriches
eggs
a
huge
nest
full
do
come
quick
we
all
hastened
to
the
spot
and
in
a
slight
hollow
of
the
ground
beheld
more
than
twenty
eggs
as
large
as
an
infant
head
the
idea
of
carrying
more
than
two
away
with
us
was
preposterous
although
the
boys
forgetting
what
the
weight
would
be
seriously
contemplated
clearing
the
nest
they
were
satisfied
when
a
kind
of
landmark
had
been
set
up
so
that
if
we
returned
we
might
easily
find
the
nest
as
each
egg
weighed
about
three
pounds
the
boys
soon
found
the
burden
considerable
even
when
tied
into
a
handkerchief
and
carried
like
a
basket
to
relieve
them
i
cut
a
strong
elastic
heath
stick
and
suspending
an
egg
in
its
sling
at
each
end
laid
the
bent
stick
over
jack
shoulder
and
like
a
dutch
with
her
milk
pails
he
stepped
merrily
along
without
inconvenience
we
presently
reached
a
marshy
place
surrounding
a
little
pool
evidently
fed
by
the
stream
which
knips
had
discovered
the
soft
ground
was
trodden
and
marked
by
the
footsteps
of
many
different
sorts
of
animals
we
saw
tracks
of
buffaloes
antelopes
onagas
or
quaggas
but
no
trace
whatever
of
any
kind
of
serpent
hitherto
our
journey
in
search
of
monster
reptiles
had
been
signalized
by
very
satisfactory
failure
by
this
brook
we
sat
down
to
rest
and
take
some
food
fangs
presently
disappeared
and
jack
calling
to
his
pet
discovered
him
gnawing
at
something
which
he
had
dug
from
the
marsh
taking
it
for
a
root
of
some
sort
jack
brought
it
for
my
inspection
i
dipped
it
in
water
to
clear
off
the
mud
and
to
my
surprise
found
a
queer
little
living
creature
no
bigger
than
half
an
apple
in
my
hand
it
was
a
small
tortoise
a
tortoise
i
declare
cried
fritz
what
a
long
way
from
the
sea
how
came
it
here
i
wonder
perhaps
there
has
been
a
remarked
ernest
one
reads
of
in
the
time
of
the
ancient
romans
hullo
professor
you
out
for
once
said
i
this
is
nothing
but
a
which
lives
in
wet
marshy
ground
and
fresh
water
they
are
useful
in
gardens
for
although
they
like
a
few
lettuce
leaves
now
and
then
they
will
destroy
numbers
of
snails
grubs
and
worms
resuming
our
journey
we
arrived
at
a
charming
valley
verdant
fruitful
and
shaded
by
clumps
of
graceful
trees
it
afforded
us
the
greatest
delight
and
refreshment
to
pass
along
this
cool
and
lovely
vale
which
we
agreed
to
call
glen
verdant
in
the
distance
we
could
see
herds
of
antelopes
or
buffaloes
feeding
but
as
our
dogs
continually
ranged
a
long
way
ahead
of
us
they
were
quickly
startled
and
vanished
up
one
or
other
of
the
narrow
gorges
which
opened
out
of
the
valley
following
the
imperceptible
windings
of
the
vale
we
were
surprised
on
quitting
it
for
the
more
open
ground
to
find
ourselves
in
a
country
we
were
already
acquainted
with
and
not
far
from
the
jackal
cave
as
we
called
the
place
where
fangs
had
been
captured
in
cubhood
on
recognizing
the
spot
ernest
who
was
in
advance
with
one
of
the
dogs
hastened
toward
it
we
lost
sight
of
him
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
arose
a
cry
of
terror
violent
barking
and
deep
surly
growls
as
we
rushed
forward
ernest
met
us
looking
white
as
ashes
and
calling
out
a
bear
a
bear
father
he
is
coming
after
me
the
boy
clung
to
me
in
mortal
fear
i
felt
his
whole
frame
quivering
courage
my
son
cried
i
disengaging
myself
from
his
grasp
we
must
prepare
for
instant
defense
the
dogs
dashed
forward
to
join
the
fray
whatever
it
was
and
not
long
were
we
in
doubt
to
my
no
small
consternation
an
enormous
bear
made
his
appearance
quickly
followed
by
another
with
leveled
guns
my
brave
fritz
and
i
advanced
slowly
to
meet
them
jack
was
also
ready
to
fire
but
the
shock
had
so
unnerved
ernest
that
he
fairly
took
to
his
heels
we
fired
together
one
at
each
bear
but
though
hit
the
monsters
were
unfortunately
only
wounded
we
found
it
most
difficult
to
take
aim
as
the
dogs
beset
them
on
all
sides
however
they
were
much
disabled
one
having
the
lower
jaw
broken
and
the
other
with
a
bullet
in
his
shoulder
was
effectually
lamed
the
dogs
perceiving
their
advantage
pressed
more
closely
round
their
foes
who
yet
defended
themselves
furiously
with
frightful
yells
of
pain
and
rage
such
was
the
confusion
and
perpetual
movement
of
the
struggle
that
i
dared
not
fire
again
seeing
that
even
slightly
wounding
one
of
our
gallant
hounds
would
instantly
place
him
in
the
power
of
the
raging
bears
watching
our
opportunity
we
suddenly
advanced
with
loaded
pistols
to
within
a
very
few
paces
of
the
animals
and
firing
both
fell
dead
one
shot
through
the
head
the
other
in
the
act
of
rearing
to
spring
on
fritz
received
his
charge
in
its
heart
thank
heaven
cried
i
as
with
dull
groans
the
brutes
sank
to
the
ground
we
have
escaped
the
greatest
peril
we
have
yet
encountered
the
dogs
continued
to
tear
and
worry
the
fallen
foe
as
though
unwilling
to
trust
the
appearance
of
death
with
feelings
somewhat
akin
i
drew
my
and
made
assurance
doubly
sure
seeing
all
safe
jack
raised
a
shout
of
victory
that
poor
ernest
might
gain
courage
to
approach
the
scene
of
conflict
which
at
last
he
did
and
joined
us
in
examining
the
dangerous
animals
as
they
lay
motionless
before
us
every
point
was
full
of
interest
their
wounds
their
sharp
teeth
their
mighty
claws
the
extraordinary
strength
of
neck
and
shoulder
all
were
remarked
and
commented
on
and
observing
that
the
shaded
brown
hair
was
tipped
with
glossy
white
i
thought
that
these
might
be
the
silver
bears
mentioned
in
captain
clarke
journey
to
the
northwest
coasts
of
america
well
my
lads
said
i
if
we
have
failed
to
catch
sight
of
serpents
we
have
at
least
made
good
riddance
of
some
other
bad
rubbish
these
fellows
would
one
day
have
worked
us
woe
or
i
am
much
mistaken
to
be
done
next
why
skin
them
to
be
sure
said
fritz
we
shall
have
a
couple
of
splendid
bearskin
rugs
as
this
process
would
take
time
and
evening
drew
on
we
dragged
the
huge
carcasses
into
their
den
to
await
our
return
concealing
them
with
boughs
of
trees
and
fencing
the
entrance
as
well
as
we
could
the
ostrich
eggs
we
also
left
behind
us
hidden
in
a
sandy
hole
by
sunset
we
reached
the
tent
and
joyfully
rejoined
the
mother
and
franz
right
glad
to
find
a
hearty
meal
prepared
for
us
as
well
as
a
large
heap
of
brushwood
for
the
when
a
full
account
of
our
adventures
had
been
given
with
a
minute
and
special
description
of
the
bear
fight
the
mother
related
what
she
had
done
during
our
absence
she
and
franz
had
made
their
way
through
the
wood
up
to
the
rocks
behind
it
and
discovered
a
bed
of
pure
white
clay
which
it
seemed
to
her
might
be
used
for
making
porcelain
then
she
had
contrived
a
drinking
trough
for
the
cattle
out
of
a
split
bamboo
she
had
arranged
a
hearth
in
a
sheltered
place
by
building
up
large
stones
cemented
with
the
white
clay
and
finally
she
had
cut
a
quantity
of
canes
and
brought
them
on
the
cart
to
be
in
readiness
for
the
building
we
had
in
hand
i
praised
the
thoughtful
diligence
which
had
effected
so
much
that
was
of
real
and
definite
use
in
order
to
try
the
clay
i
put
some
balls
of
it
in
the
fire
now
kindled
to
burn
during
the
night
and
we
then
betook
ourselves
to
rest
under
shelter
of
our
tent
i
awoke
at
dawn
and
aroused
my
little
party
my
first
idea
was
to
examine
the
clay
balls
which
i
found
baked
hard
and
finely
glazed
but
too
much
melted
down
by
the
heat
a
fault
which
seeing
the
excellent
quality
of
the
clay
i
knew
it
would
be
well
worth
while
to
remedy
after
breakfast
and
our
accustomed
devotions
we
harnessed
the
cart
and
took
the
way
to
the
bears
den
fritz
headed
the
party
and
coming
in
sight
of
the
entrance
to
the
cave
called
out
softly
make
haste
and
you
will
see
a
whole
crowd
of
wild
turkeys
who
seem
to
have
come
to
attend
the
funeral
obsequies
of
their
respected
friend
and
neighbor
bruin
here
but
there
appears
to
be
a
jealous
watcher
who
is
unwilling
to
admit
the
visitors
to
the
bed
of
state
the
watcher
as
fritz
called
him
was
an
immensely
large
bird
with
a
sort
of
comb
on
his
head
and
a
loose
fleshy
skin
hanging
from
beneath
the
beak
part
of
the
neck
was
bare
wrinkled
and
while
around
it
resting
on
the
shoulders
was
a
downy
collar
of
soft
white
feathers
the
plumage
was
marked
here
and
there
with
white
patches
the
feet
appeared
to
be
armed
with
strong
claws
this
great
bird
guarded
the
entrance
to
the
cave
occasionally
retiring
into
it
himself
for
a
few
minutes
but
as
soon
as
the
other
birds
came
pressing
in
after
him
he
hurried
out
again
and
they
were
forced
to
retire
we
stopped
to
observe
this
curious
scene
and
were
startled
suddenly
by
a
mighty
rush
of
wings
in
the
air
above
us
we
looked
up
at
the
same
moment
fritz
fired
and
an
enormous
bird
fell
heavily
head
foremost
on
the
rocks
by
which
its
neck
was
broken
while
blood
flowed
from
a
wound
in
the
breast
we
had
been
holding
back
the
dogs
but
they
with
fritz
now
rushed
toward
the
cave
the
birds
rising
around
them
and
departing
with
heavy
ungainly
flight
leaving
only
fritz
prize
and
one
of
the
other
birds
killed
by
the
large
one
in
its
fall
with
the
utmost
caution
i
entered
the
cave
and
rejoiced
to
find
that
the
tongue
and
eyes
only
of
the
bears
had
been
devoured
a
little
later
and
we
should
have
had
the
handsome
skins
pecked
and
torn
to
rags
and
all
chance
of
steaks
and
bears
paws
gone
on
measuring
the
wings
of
the
large
bird
from
tip
to
tip
i
found
the
length
exceeded
eleven
feet
and
concluded
it
to
be
a
condor
it
was
evidently
the
mate
of
the
watcher
as
fritz
called
the
first
we
saw
to
work
we
now
went
on
the
bears
and
no
slight
affair
we
found
it
to
skin
and
cut
them
up
but
by
dint
of
perseverance
we
at
last
succeeded
in
our
object
determining
to
smoke
the
meat
on
the
spot
we
cut
magnificent
hams
and
took
off
the
rest
of
the
meat
in
slices
after
the
manner
of
the
buccaneers
in
the
west
indies
preserving
the
paws
entire
to
be
cooked
as
a
delicacy
and
obtaining
from
the
two
bears
together
a
prodigious
supply
of
lard
which
my
wife
gladly
undertook
to
melt
and
prepare
for
keeping
the
bones
and
offal
we
drew
to
some
distance
with
the
help
of
our
cattle
and
made
the
birds
of
the
air
most
welcome
to
feast
upon
it
this
with
the
assistance
of
all
sorts
of
insects
they
did
so
effectually
that
before
we
left
the
place
the
skulls
were
picked
perfectly
clean
the
sun
had
dried
them
and
they
were
ready
for
us
to
carry
off
to
our
museum
the
skins
had
to
be
very
carefully
scraped
washed
salted
cleansed
with
ashes
and
dried
which
occupied
fully
two
days
i
was
lamenting
our
distance
from
the
rascusara
tree
the
leaves
of
which
had
flavored
our
roast
peccary
so
nicely
when
i
observed
among
the
brushwood
which
the
boys
had
brought
from
the
thickets
around
us
a
climbing
plant
whose
leaves
had
a
very
strong
smell
the
stem
resembled
a
vine
and
the
fruit
grew
in
clusters
like
currants
some
were
red
and
some
of
a
green
color
which
i
supposed
to
denote
various
degrees
of
ripeness
they
were
hard
and
the
outer
skin
was
quite
thin
i
recognized
in
this
the
pepper
plant
a
discovery
particularly
agreeable
at
this
moment
the
boys
soon
gathered
a
large
supply
the
red
berries
were
soaked
in
salt
and
water
for
several
days
then
washed
and
rubbed
and
finally
becoming
perfectly
white
were
dried
in
the
sun
the
treatment
of
the
green
berries
was
simple
they
were
merely
exposed
to
the
sun
heat
for
a
day
or
two
and
then
stored
in
this
way
we
obtained
enough
both
of
black
and
white
pepper
to
last
us
a
very
long
time
i
took
also
a
number
of
young
plants
that
we
might
have
pepper
growing
at
rockburg
and
our
various
settlements
some
roots
of
another
plant
were
also
taken
which
from
the
pods
appeared
to
be
a
kind
of
bean
we
were
glad
of
this
occupation
during
the
tedious
business
of
smoking
the
bears
meat
and
availed
ourselves
of
the
leisure
time
by
also
preparing
for
stuffing
the
condor
and
the
turkey
buzzard
urubu
or
black
vulture
for
i
could
not
determine
to
which
species
the
smaller
bird
belonged
the
four
boys
at
length
became
so
weary
of
inaction
that
i
determined
to
let
them
make
an
excursion
alone
on
the
savannah
three
of
them
received
this
permission
with
eager
delight
but
ernest
said
he
would
prefer
to
remain
with
us
to
which
as
the
expedition
was
to
be
entirely
one
of
pleasure
i
could
make
no
objection
little
franz
on
the
other
hand
whom
i
would
willingly
have
kept
with
us
was
wild
to
go
with
his
brothers
and
i
was
obliged
to
consent
as
i
had
made
the
proposal
open
to
all
and
could
not
draw
back
in
the
highest
spirits
they
ran
to
bring
their
steeds
as
we
were
fain
to
call
the
cattle
they
rode
from
their
pasturage
at
a
short
distance
speedily
were
they
saddled
bridled
and
mounted
the
three
lads
were
ready
to
be
off
it
was
my
wish
that
our
sons
should
cultivate
a
habit
of
bold
independence
for
well
i
knew
that
it
might
easily
be
the
will
of
god
to
deprive
them
of
their
parents
when
without
an
enterprising
spirit
of
self
reliance
their
position
would
be
truly
miserable
my
gallant
fritz
possessed
this
desirable
quality
in
no
small
degree
and
to
him
i
committed
the
care
of
his
young
brothers
charging
them
to
look
up
to
and
obey
him
as
their
leader
they
were
well
armed
well
mounted
had
a
couple
of
good
dogs
and
with
a
hearty
god
speed
and
bless
you
my
boys
i
let
them
depart
we
who
remained
behind
passed
the
day
in
a
variety
of
useful
occupations
the
bears
meat
which
was
being
cured
in
a
smoking
shed
such
as
that
we
set
up
for
the
peccary
hams
required
a
good
deal
of
attention
from
my
wife
ernest
had
a
fancy
for
making
ornamental
cups
from
the
ostrich
eggs
while
i
investigated
the
interior
of
the
cave
i
found
the
inner
wall
to
consist
of
a
kind
of
talc
mingled
with
threads
of
asbestos
and
also
indications
of
mica
examining
further
i
detached
a
large
block
and
found
to
my
joy
that
i
could
split
it
into
clear
transparent
sheets
which
would
serve
admirably
for
window
panes
my
wife
saw
this
substitute
for
glass
with
unfeigned
satisfaction
declaring
that
although
she
would
not
complain
yet
the
want
of
glass
for
windows
had
been
a
downright
trouble
to
her
chapter
xiii
breaking
in
a
refractory
steed
as
evening
approached
the
bears
paws
which
were
stewing
for
supper
sent
forth
savory
odors
and
we
sat
talking
round
the
fire
while
listening
anxiously
for
sounds
heralding
the
return
of
our
young
explorers
at
last
the
tramp
and
beat
of
hoofs
struck
our
ears
the
little
troop
appeared
crossing
the
open
ground
before
us
at
a
sharp
trot
and
a
shrill
ringing
cheer
greeted
us
as
we
rose
and
went
to
meet
them
they
sprang
from
their
saddles
the
animals
were
set
at
liberty
to
refresh
themselves
and
the
riders
eagerly
came
to
exhibit
their
acquisitions
and
give
an
account
of
themselves
funny
figures
they
cut
franz
and
jack
had
each
a
young
kid
slung
on
his
back
so
that
the
four
legs
tied
together
stuck
out
under
their
chins
fritz
game
bag
looked
remarkably
queer
round
lumps
sharp
points
and
an
occasional
movement
seemed
to
indicate
a
living
creature
or
creatures
within
hurrah
for
the
chase
father
cried
jack
nothing
like
real
hunting
after
all
and
just
to
see
how
storm
and
grumble
go
along
over
a
grassy
plain
it
is
perfectly
splendid
we
soon
tired
out
the
little
antelopes
and
were
able
to
catch
them
yes
father
said
franz
and
fritz
has
two
angora
rabbits
in
his
bag
and
we
wanted
to
bring
you
some
honey
only
think
such
a
clever
bird
a
cuckoo
showed
us
where
it
was
my
brothers
forget
the
chief
thing
said
fritz
we
have
driven
a
little
herd
of
antelopes
right
through
the
gap
into
our
territory
and
there
they
are
all
ready
for
us
to
hunt
when
we
like
or
to
catch
and
tame
well
done
cried
i
here
is
indeed
a
list
of
achievements
but
to
your
mother
and
me
the
chief
thing
of
all
is
god
goodness
in
bringing
you
safe
back
to
us
now
let
us
hear
the
whole
story
that
we
may
have
a
definite
idea
of
your
performances
we
had
a
splendid
ride
said
fritz
down
glen
verdant
and
away
to
the
defile
through
our
rocky
barrier
and
the
morning
was
so
cool
and
fresh
that
our
steeds
galloped
along
nearly
the
whole
way
at
the
top
of
their
speed
when
we
had
passed
through
the
gap
we
moderated
our
furious
pace
and
kept
our
eyes
open
on
the
lookout
for
game
we
then
trotted
slowly
to
the
top
of
a
grassy
hill
from
whose
summit
we
saw
two
herds
of
animals
whether
antelopes
goats
or
gazelles
we
did
not
know
grazing
by
the
side
of
the
stream
below
us
we
were
about
to
gallop
down
and
try
to
get
a
shot
at
them
when
it
struck
me
that
it
would
be
wiser
to
try
and
drive
the
whole
herd
through
the
gap
into
our
own
domain
where
they
would
be
shut
up
as
it
were
in
a
park
free
and
yet
within
reach
down
the
hill
we
rode
as
hard
as
we
could
go
formed
in
a
behind
the
larger
herd
magnificent
antelopes
and
aided
by
the
dogs
with
shouts
and
cries
drove
them
along
the
stream
toward
the
gap
as
we
came
near
the
opening
they
appeared
inclined
to
halt
and
turn
like
sheep
about
to
be
driven
into
the
butcher
yard
and
it
was
all
we
could
do
to
prevent
them
from
bolting
past
us
but
at
length
one
made
a
rush
at
the
opening
and
the
rest
following
they
were
soon
all
on
the
other
side
of
the
frontier
and
inhabitants
of
new
switzerland
capital
i
said
capital
my
boy
but
i
do
see
what
is
to
make
them
remain
inhabitants
of
our
domain
or
to
prevent
them
from
returning
through
the
gap
whenever
they
feel
inclined
stop
father
he
replied
you
interrupt
me
too
soon
we
thought
of
that
possibility
too
and
provided
against
it
we
stretched
a
long
line
right
across
the
defile
and
strung
on
it
feathers
and
rags
and
all
sorts
of
other
things
which
danced
and
fluttered
in
the
wind
and
looked
so
strange
that
i
am
perfectly
certain
that
the
herd
will
never
attempt
to
pass
it
in
fact
levaillant
from
whom
i
learned
the
trick
says
in
his
au
cap
de
bonne
espérance
that
the
hottentots
make
use
of
the
method
for
penning
in
the
antelopes
they
have
caught
in
the
chase
well
done
said
i
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
remember
what
you
have
read
the
antelopes
are
welcome
to
new
switzerland
but
my
boy
i
added
i
can
not
say
the
same
for
the
rabbits
you
have
there
they
increase
so
rapidly
that
if
you
establish
a
colony
of
the
little
wretches
your
next
difficulty
will
be
to
get
rid
of
them
true
he
replied
but
my
idea
was
to
place
them
upon
whale
island
where
they
would
find
abundant
food
and
at
the
same
time
in
no
way
trouble
us
may
i
not
establish
a
warren
there
it
would
be
so
useful
do
you
know
my
eagle
caught
these
pretty
little
fellows
for
me
i
saw
a
number
of
them
running
about
and
so
unhooded
him
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
brought
me
three
one
dead
with
whose
body
i
rewarded
him
and
these
two
here
unhurt
now
father
said
jack
interrupting
him
do
listen
to
me
and
hear
my
story
or
else
fritz
will
begin
upon
my
adventures
and
tire
you
out
with
his
rigmarole
descriptions
certainly
jack
i
said
i
am
quite
ready
to
listen
to
you
first
and
foremost
how
did
you
bring
down
those
beautiful
little
animals
you
have
there
oh
we
galloped
them
down
the
dogs
sniffed
about
in
the
grass
while
fritz
was
away
after
the
rabbits
out
popped
those
little
fawns
and
away
they
went
bounding
and
skipping
at
the
rate
of
thirty
miles
an
hour
with
storm
grumble
and
the
dogs
at
their
heels
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
had
left
the
dogs
behind
and
were
close
upon
our
prey
down
went
the
little
creatures
in
the
grass
and
overcome
with
terror
and
fatigue
were
at
our
mercy
so
we
shouted
to
fritz
and
my
dear
boy
said
i
according
to
your
statement
fritz
must
have
been
seven
miles
and
a
half
off
oh
well
father
perhaps
we
did
not
ride
for
quite
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
of
course
i
ca
say
exactly
how
fast
we
were
going
and
then
you
see
the
fawns
did
not
run
in
a
straight
line
at
any
rate
fritz
heard
us
and
he
and
franz
and
i
leashed
the
legs
of
the
pretty
creatures
and
then
we
mounted
again
and
presently
saw
a
wretch
of
a
cuckoo
who
led
us
ever
so
far
out
of
our
course
by
cuckooing
and
making
faces
at
us
and
then
hopping
away
franz
declared
it
must
be
an
enchanted
princess
and
so
i
thought
i
would
rid
it
of
its
spell
but
fritz
stopped
me
shooting
it
and
said
it
was
a
indicator
and
that
it
was
leading
us
probably
to
a
bees
byke
so
we
spared
its
life
and
presently
sure
enough
it
stopped
close
by
a
bees
nest
in
a
hollow
mound
this
was
capital
we
thought
and
as
we
were
in
a
great
hurry
to
taste
the
honey
i
threw
in
a
lot
of
lighted
lucifer
matches
but
somehow
it
did
not
kill
the
bees
at
all
but
only
made
them
awfully
angry
and
they
flew
out
in
a
body
and
stung
me
all
over
i
rushed
to
storm
and
sprang
on
his
back
but
though
i
galloped
away
for
bare
life
it
was
an
age
before
i
got
rid
of
the
little
wretches
and
now
my
face
is
in
a
perfect
fever
i
think
i
will
get
mother
to
bathe
it
for
me
and
off
rushed
the
noisy
boy
leaving
fritz
and
me
to
see
to
the
fawns
and
examine
the
rabbits
with
these
latter
i
determined
to
do
as
fritz
proposed
namely
to
colonize
whale
island
with
them
i
was
all
the
more
willing
to
do
this
because
i
had
been
considering
the
advisability
of
establishing
on
that
island
a
fortress
to
which
we
might
retreat
in
any
extreme
danger
and
where
we
should
be
very
thankful
in
case
of
such
a
retreat
to
possess
means
of
obtaining
a
constant
supply
of
animal
food
having
ministered
to
the
wants
of
the
antelopes
i
tried
to
interest
the
boys
in
my
discovery
of
the
block
of
talc
but
just
then
their
mother
summoned
us
to
dinner
the
principal
dish
in
this
meal
consisted
of
the
bears
paws
most
savory
smelling
delicacies
so
tempting
that
their
close
resemblance
to
human
hands
and
even
the
roguish
from
jack
did
not
prevent
a
single
member
of
the
family
from
enjoying
them
most
heartily
supper
over
we
lit
our
retired
to
our
tent
and
slept
soundly
we
had
been
working
very
diligently
the
bears
meat
was
smoked
the
fat
melted
down
and
stored
and
a
large
supply
of
bamboos
collected
but
i
wished
to
make
yet
another
excursion
and
at
early
dawn
i
aroused
the
boys
fritz
mounted
the
mule
i
rode
lightfoot
jack
and
franz
took
their
usual
steeds
and
with
the
two
dogs
we
galloped
off
first
to
visit
the
euphorbia
to
collect
the
gum
and
then
to
discover
whether
the
ostrich
had
deserted
her
eggs
in
the
sand
ernest
watched
us
depart
without
the
slightest
look
or
sign
of
regret
and
returned
to
the
tent
to
assist
his
mother
and
study
his
books
our
steeds
carried
us
down
the
green
valley
at
a
rapid
rate
and
we
followed
the
direction
we
had
pursued
on
our
former
expedition
we
soon
reached
turtle
marsh
and
then
filling
our
we
arrived
at
the
rising
ground
where
fritz
discovered
the
mounted
arabs
as
jack
and
franz
wanted
a
gallop
i
allowed
them
to
press
forward
while
fritz
and
i
visited
the
euphorbia
trees
a
quantity
of
red
gum
had
exuded
from
the
incisions
i
had
made
and
as
this
had
coagulated
in
the
sun
i
rolled
it
into
little
balls
and
stored
it
in
a
bamboo
jar
i
had
brought
with
me
for
the
purpose
as
we
rode
after
the
boys
who
were
some
way
ahead
fritz
remarked
did
you
not
tell
me
that
the
juice
of
that
tree
was
poisonous
father
why
have
you
collected
such
a
quantity
i
did
indeed
say
so
i
replied
it
is
a
most
deadly
poison
the
inhabitants
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
use
it
to
poison
the
springs
where
wild
animals
assemble
to
quench
their
thirst
and
they
thus
slaughter
an
immense
number
of
the
creatures
for
the
sake
of
their
hides
i
intend
however
to
use
it
to
destroy
the
apes
should
they
again
commit
depredations
and
also
in
preparing
the
skins
of
animals
to
protect
them
from
the
attacks
of
insects
the
two
boys
were
still
at
some
distance
from
us
when
suddenly
four
magnificent
ostriches
rose
from
the
sand
where
they
had
been
sitting
jack
and
franz
perceived
them
and
with
a
great
shout
drove
them
toward
us
in
front
ran
a
splendid
male
bird
his
feathers
of
shining
black
and
his
great
tail
plume
waving
behind
three
females
of
an
ashen
gray
color
followed
him
they
approached
us
with
incredible
swiftness
and
were
within
gunshot
before
they
perceived
us
fritz
had
had
the
forethought
to
bind
up
the
beak
of
his
eagle
so
that
should
he
bring
down
an
ostrich
he
might
be
unable
to
injure
it
he
now
threw
up
the
falcon
which
towering
upward
swooped
down
upon
the
head
of
the
foremost
bird
and
so
confused
and
alarmed
him
that
he
could
not
defend
himself
nor
continue
his
flight
so
greatly
was
his
speed
checked
that
jack
overtook
him
and
hurling
his
lasso
enfolded
his
wings
and
legs
in
its
deadly
coils
and
brought
him
to
the
ground
the
other
ostriches
were
almost
out
of
sight
so
leaving
them
to
their
own
devices
we
leaped
from
our
steeds
and
attempted
to
approach
the
captured
bird
he
struggled
fearfully
and
kicked
with
such
violence
right
and
left
that
i
almost
despaired
of
getting
him
home
alive
illustration
greatly
was
the
speed
of
the
ostrich
checked
that
jack
overtook
it
occurred
to
me
however
that
if
we
could
cover
his
eyes
his
fury
might
be
subdued
i
instantly
acted
upon
this
idea
and
flung
over
his
head
my
coat
and
which
effectually
shut
out
the
light
no
sooner
had
i
done
this
than
his
struggles
ceased
and
we
were
able
to
approach
we
first
secured
round
his
body
a
broad
strip
of
sealskin
on
each
side
of
which
i
fastened
a
stout
piece
of
cord
that
i
might
be
able
to
lead
him
easily
then
fastening
another
cord
in
a
loop
round
his
legs
that
he
might
be
prevented
from
breaking
into
a
gallop
we
released
him
from
the
coils
of
the
lasso
do
you
know
said
i
to
the
boys
how
the
natives
of
india
secure
a
newly
captured
elephant
oh
yes
said
fritz
they
fasten
him
between
two
tame
elephants
we
do
that
to
this
fine
fellow
and
tame
him
double
quick
the
only
difficulty
will
be
remarked
jack
that
we
have
no
tame
ostriches
however
i
daresay
storm
and
grumble
will
have
no
objection
to
perform
their
part
and
it
will
puzzle
even
this
great
monster
to
run
away
with
them
so
we
at
once
began
operations
storm
and
grumble
were
led
up
on
either
side
of
the
recumbent
ostrich
and
the
cords
secured
to
their
girths
jack
and
franz
each
armed
with
a
stout
whip
mounted
their
respective
steeds
the
wrappers
were
removed
from
the
bird
eyes
and
we
stood
by
to
watch
what
would
next
occur
for
some
moments
after
the
return
of
his
sight
he
lay
perfectly
still
then
he
arose
with
a
bound
and
not
aware
of
the
cords
which
hampered
him
attempted
to
dash
forward
the
thongs
were
stout
and
he
was
brought
to
his
knees
a
fruitless
struggle
ensued
and
then
at
length
seeming
to
accommodate
himself
to
circumstances
he
set
off
at
a
sharp
trot
his
guards
making
the
air
with
their
merry
shouts
these
cries
stimulated
the
ostrich
to
yet
further
exertions
but
he
was
at
length
brought
to
a
stand
by
the
determined
refusal
of
his
companions
to
continue
such
a
race
across
loose
sand
the
boys
having
enjoyed
the
long
run
i
told
them
to
walk
with
the
prisoner
slowly
home
while
fritz
and
i
returned
to
examine
the
ostrich
nest
the
eggs
were
quite
warm
and
i
was
certain
that
the
mother
had
quite
recently
left
the
nest
leaving
about
half
i
packed
the
rest
of
the
eggs
in
a
large
bag
i
had
brought
for
the
purpose
and
slung
it
carefully
on
the
saddle
before
me
we
soon
caught
up
our
advance
guard
and
without
other
notable
incident
reached
our
tent
astonishment
and
dismay
were
depicted
on
the
face
of
the
mother
as
we
approached
my
dear
husband
she
exclaimed
do
you
think
our
provisions
so
abundant
that
you
must
scour
the
deserts
to
find
some
great
beast
to
assist
us
to
devour
them
you
must
discover
an
iron
mine
next
for
iron
is
what
ostriches
chiefly
live
on
is
it
not
oh
i
do
wish
you
would
be
content
with
the
menagerie
you
have
already
collected
instead
of
bringing
in
a
specimen
of
every
beast
you
come
across
and
this
is
such
a
useless
monster
useless
mother
exclaimed
jack
you
would
not
say
so
had
you
seen
him
run
why
he
will
be
the
fleetest
courser
in
our
stables
i
am
going
to
make
a
saddle
and
bridle
for
him
and
in
future
he
shall
be
my
only
steed
then
as
for
his
appetite
father
declares
it
is
most
delicate
he
only
wants
a
little
fruit
and
grass
and
a
few
stones
and
tenpenny
nails
to
help
his
digestion
the
way
in
which
jack
assumed
the
proprietorship
of
our
new
prize
seemed
to
strike
his
brothers
as
rather
cool
and
there
was
instantly
a
cry
raised
on
the
subject
very
well
said
jack
let
us
each
take
possession
of
the
part
of
the
ostrich
we
captured
your
bird
fritz
seized
the
head
keep
that
father
shall
have
the
body
i
have
the
legs
and
franz
a
couple
of
feathers
from
the
tail
come
come
said
i
i
think
that
jack
has
a
very
good
right
to
the
ostrich
seeing
that
he
brought
it
to
the
ground
and
if
he
succeeds
in
taming
it
and
converting
it
into
a
saddle
horse
it
shall
be
his
from
this
time
therefore
he
is
responsible
for
its
training
the
day
was
now
too
far
advanced
to
allow
us
to
think
of
setting
out
for
rockburg
so
we
fastened
up
the
ostrich
between
two
trees
and
devoted
the
remainder
of
the
evening
to
making
preparations
for
our
departure
at
early
dawn
our
picturesque
caravan
was
moving
homeward
the
ostrich
continued
so
refractory
that
we
were
obliged
to
make
him
again
march
between
storm
and
grumble
and
as
these
gallant
steeds
were
thus
employed
the
cow
was
harnessed
to
the
cart
laden
with
our
treasures
room
was
left
in
the
cart
for
the
mother
jack
and
franz
mounted
storm
and
grumble
i
rode
lightfoot
and
fritz
brought
up
the
rear
on
swift
at
the
mouth
of
the
gap
we
called
a
halt
and
replaced
the
cord
the
boys
had
strung
with
ostrich
feathers
by
a
stout
palisade
of
bamboos
i
also
took
the
opportunity
of
collecting
a
store
of
pipeclay
as
i
intended
during
the
winter
months
which
were
close
at
hand
to
try
my
hand
at
china
making
when
we
reached
the
grove
we
again
stopped
to
collect
the
peccary
hams
we
had
left
to
be
smoked
and
my
wife
begged
me
to
gather
some
seeds
of
an
aromatic
plant
which
grew
in
the
neighborhood
and
which
had
the
scent
of
vanilla
i
obtained
a
good
supply
and
we
moved
forward
toward
woodlands
where
we
intended
to
rest
for
the
night
after
our
long
and
fatiguing
march
our
tent
was
pitched
and
on
our
beds
of
cotton
we
slept
soundly
next
morning
early
we
examined
our
farmyard
which
appeared
in
a
most
prosperous
and
flourishing
condition
the
sight
of
all
these
domestic
animals
made
us
long
even
more
than
ever
for
our
home
at
rockburg
and
we
determined
to
hasten
thither
with
all
possible
speed
the
number
of
our
pigs
goats
and
poultry
had
greatly
increased
since
we
had
last
visited
our
colony
and
some
of
these
two
fine
broods
of
chickens
especially
my
wife
wished
to
take
back
with
her
we
found
that
the
herd
of
antelopes
which
fritz
and
jack
had
driven
through
the
gap
had
taken
up
their
abode
in
the
neighborhood
and
several
times
we
saw
the
beautiful
animals
browsing
among
the
trees
while
at
the
farm
we
repaired
both
the
animals
stalls
and
our
dwelling
room
that
the
former
might
be
more
secure
against
the
attacks
of
wild
beasts
and
the
latter
fitted
for
our
accommodation
when
we
should
visit
the
spot
everything
at
length
being
satisfactorily
arranged
we
again
retired
to
rest
and
early
next
morning
completed
our
journey
to
rockburg
by
we
were
once
more
settled
at
home
windows
and
doors
were
thrown
open
to
admit
fresh
air
the
animals
established
in
their
stalls
and
the
cart
miscellaneous
cargo
discharged
and
arranged
as
much
time
as
i
could
spare
i
devoted
to
the
ostrich
whom
we
fastened
for
the
present
between
two
bamboo
posts
in
front
of
our
dwelling
i
then
turned
my
attention
to
the
eggs
we
had
brought
and
which
i
determined
to
hatch
if
possible
by
artificial
heat
for
this
purpose
i
arranged
a
stove
which
i
maintained
at
a
uniform
temperature
and
on
it
i
placed
the
eggs
carefully
wrapped
in
cotton
wool
next
morning
fritz
and
i
went
off
in
the
boat
first
to
whale
island
there
to
establish
our
colonists
the
angora
rabbits
and
then
to
shark
island
where
we
placed
the
dainty
little
antelopes
having
made
them
happy
with
their
liberty
and
abundance
of
food
we
returned
as
quickly
as
possible
to
cure
the
bearskins
and
add
the
provisions
we
had
brought
to
the
stores
lying
in
our
cellar
as
we
returned
we
caught
up
jack
making
his
way
in
great
glee
toward
rockburg
he
was
carrying
in
a
basket
an
immense
eel
which
he
and
ernest
had
secured
ernest
had
set
on
the
previous
night
a
couple
of
lines
one
had
been
dragged
away
but
on
the
other
they
found
this
splendid
fellow
it
proved
delicious
half
was
prepared
for
dinner
and
the
other
half
salted
and
stowed
away
we
now
for
a
short
time
again
turned
our
attention
to
our
duties
about
the
house
thinking
that
the
veranda
would
be
greatly
improved
by
some
creepers
i
sowed
round
the
foot
of
each
bamboo
pillar
vanilla
and
as
well
as
that
of
other
creeping
plants
which
would
not
only
give
the
house
a
pleasanter
aspect
but
also
afford
us
shade
during
the
summer
months
i
constructed
a
couple
of
too
for
the
hens
and
their
little
chicks
which
we
had
brought
from
woodlands
for
i
knew
that
if
i
left
them
unprotected
the
inquisitive
dispositions
of
knips
and
fangs
might
induce
them
to
make
anatomical
experiments
which
would
be
detrimental
to
the
welfare
of
the
youngsters
ernest
rat
skins
were
voted
a
nuisance
within
doors
and
were
tied
together
and
hung
up
outside
so
powerful
was
the
odor
they
emitted
that
even
then
jack
would
pretend
to
faint
every
time
he
passed
near
them
the
museum
received
its
additions
the
condor
and
vulture
were
placed
there
to
be
stuffed
when
we
should
find
time
during
the
rainy
season
the
mica
and
asbestos
too
were
brought
in
for
the
present
not
to
lie
there
idle
but
to
wait
until
i
could
use
them
as
i
intended
for
china
and
having
occupied
two
days
in
this
way
we
turned
our
attention
to
other
duties
the
cultivation
of
a
wheat
barley
and
maize
field
the
management
of
the
ostrich
eggs
and
the
taming
of
the
captives
as
agriculture
was
though
the
least
to
our
taste
the
most
important
of
these
several
duties
we
set
about
it
first
the
animals
drew
the
plow
but
the
digging
and
hoeing
taxed
our
powers
of
endurance
to
the
utmost
we
worked
two
hours
in
the
morning
and
two
in
the
evening
fully
did
we
realize
the
words
of
scripture
in
the
sweat
of
thy
face
shalt
thou
eat
bread
in
the
interval
we
devoted
our
attention
to
the
ostrich
but
our
efforts
on
behalf
of
his
education
seemed
all
in
vain
he
appeared
as
untamable
as
ever
i
determined
therefore
to
adopt
the
plan
which
had
subdued
the
refractory
eagle
the
effect
of
the
tobacco
fumes
almost
alarmed
me
the
ostrich
sank
to
the
ground
and
lay
motionless
slowly
at
length
he
arose
and
paced
up
and
down
between
the
bamboo
posts
he
was
subdued
but
to
my
dismay
resolutely
refused
all
food
i
feared
he
would
die
for
three
days
he
pined
growing
weaker
and
weaker
each
day
food
he
must
have
said
i
to
my
wife
food
he
must
have
the
mother
determined
to
attempt
an
experiment
she
prepared
balls
of
maize
flour
mixed
with
butter
one
of
these
she
placed
within
the
bird
beak
he
swallowed
it
and
stretched
out
his
long
neck
looking
inquiringly
for
a
second
mouthful
a
second
third
and
fourth
ball
followed
the
first
his
appetite
returned
and
his
strength
came
again
all
the
wild
nature
of
the
bird
had
gone
and
i
saw
with
delight
that
we
might
begin
his
education
as
soon
as
we
chose
rice
guavas
maize
and
corn
he
ate
readily
washing
it
down
as
jack
expressed
it
with
small
pebbles
to
the
great
surprise
of
franz
to
whom
i
explained
that
the
ostrich
was
merely
following
the
instinct
common
to
all
birds
that
he
required
these
pebbles
to
digest
his
food
just
as
smaller
birds
require
gravel
after
a
month
of
careful
training
our
captive
would
trot
gallop
obey
the
sound
of
our
voice
feed
from
our
hand
and
in
fact
showed
himself
perfectly
docile
now
our
ingenuity
was
taxed
to
the
utmost
how
were
we
to
saddle
and
bridle
a
bird
first
for
a
bit
for
his
beak
vague
ideas
passed
through
my
mind
but
every
one
i
was
obliged
to
reject
a
plan
at
length
occurred
to
me
i
recollected
the
effect
of
light
and
its
absence
upon
the
ostrich
how
his
movements
were
checked
by
sudden
darkness
and
how
with
the
light
power
returned
to
his
limbs
i
immediately
constructed
a
leathern
hood
to
reach
from
the
neck
to
the
beak
cutting
holes
in
it
for
the
eyes
and
ears
over
the
eyeholes
i
contrived
square
flaps
or
blinkers
which
were
so
arranged
with
whalebone
springs
that
they
closed
tightly
of
themselves
the
reins
were
connected
with
these
blinkers
so
that
the
flaps
might
be
raised
or
allowed
to
close
at
the
rider
pleasure
when
both
blinkers
were
open
the
ostrich
would
gallop
straight
ahead
close
his
right
eye
and
he
turned
to
the
left
close
his
left
and
he
turned
to
the
right
shut
both
and
he
stood
stock
still
i
was
justly
proud
of
my
contrivance
but
before
i
could
really
test
its
utility
i
was
obliged
to
make
a
saddle
after
several
failures
i
succeeded
in
manufacturing
one
to
my
liking
and
in
properly
securing
it
it
was
something
like
an
trooper
saddle
peaked
before
and
behind
for
my
great
fear
was
lest
the
boys
should
fall
this
contrivance
i
placed
upon
the
shoulders
as
near
the
neck
as
possible
and
secured
it
with
strong
girths
round
the
wings
and
across
the
breast
to
avoid
all
possibility
of
the
saddle
slipping
down
the
bird
sloping
back
i
soon
saw
that
my
plan
would
succeed
though
skill
and
considerable
practice
was
necessary
in
the
use
of
my
patent
bridle
it
was
difficult
to
remember
that
to
check
the
courser
speed
it
was
necessary
to
slacken
rein
and
that
the
tighter
the
reins
were
drawn
the
faster
he
would
fly
we
at
length
however
all
learned
to
manage
master
hurricane
and
the
distance
between
rockburg
and
falconhurst
was
traversed
in
an
almost
incredibly
short
space
of
time
the
marvelous
speed
of
the
bird
again
revived
the
dispute
as
to
the
ownership
and
i
was
obliged
to
interfere
jack
shall
retain
the
ostrich
said
i
for
it
is
most
suited
to
him
he
is
a
lighter
weight
than
either
of
you
his
elder
brothers
and
franz
is
not
yet
strong
enough
to
manage
such
a
fleet
courser
but
he
is
so
far
to
be
considered
common
property
that
all
may
practice
on
him
occasionally
and
in
a
case
of
necessity
anyone
may
mount
him
our
field
work
was
by
this
time
over
the
land
had
been
plowed
and
sown
with
wheat
barley
and
maize
on
the
other
side
of
jackal
river
we
had
planted
potatoes
and
cassava
roots
and
all
sorts
of
other
seeds
had
been
carefully
sown
we
had
not
neglected
the
ostrich
eggs
and
one
day
fritz
introduced
me
with
great
glee
to
three
little
ostriches
but
alas
the
little
creatures
were
not
destined
to
enjoy
life
long
one
died
almost
as
soon
as
it
was
hatched
and
the
others
after
tottering
about
on
their
legs
for
a
few
days
followed
its
example
i
now
found
time
to
turn
my
attention
to
the
bears
skins
which
required
preparation
before
they
would
be
fit
for
use
as
leather
they
had
been
salted
and
dried
and
now
required
tanning
i
had
no
tan
however
this
was
unfortunate
but
not
to
be
deterred
from
my
purpose
i
determined
to
use
a
mixture
of
honey
and
water
in
its
place
the
experiment
proved
successful
when
the
skins
were
dried
they
remained
flexible
and
free
from
smell
while
the
fur
was
soft
and
glossy
this
was
not
the
only
result
of
the
experiment
for
the
which
i
boiled
appeared
so
clear
and
tempting
that
it
struck
me
that
i
might
prepare
from
it
an
excellent
drink
i
put
by
some
of
the
liquid
before
making
use
of
it
as
tan
and
reboiled
it
with
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
the
preparation
which
much
resembled
english
mead
was
pronounced
delicious
and
the
mother
begged
me
to
brew
a
large
supply
as
our
cellar
was
now
well
stocked
with
provisions
for
the
winter
and
our
other
preparations
were
completed
i
was
able
to
turn
my
attention
to
details
of
lesser
importance
the
boys
had
been
clamoring
for
hats
and
as
my
success
in
so
many
trades
had
surprised
me
i
agreed
to
turn
hatter
for
the
nonce
with
the
rat
skins
and
a
solution
of
india
rubber
i
produced
a
kind
of
felt
which
i
dyed
a
brilliant
red
with
cochineal
and
stretching
this
on
a
wooden
block
i
had
prepared
i
passed
over
it
a
hot
iron
to
smooth
the
nap
and
by
next
morning
had
the
satisfaction
of
presenting
to
my
wife
a
neat
little
red
swiss
cap
to
be
lined
and
finished
by
her
for
one
of
the
boys
the
mother
admired
the
production
immensely
and
lining
it
with
silk
added
yet
more
to
its
gay
appearance
by
adorning
it
with
ribbons
and
ostrich
feathers
and
finally
placed
it
upon
the
head
of
little
franz
so
delighted
was
everyone
with
the
hat
that
all
were
eager
to
be
similarly
provided
and
begged
me
to
manufacture
more
i
readily
agreed
to
do
so
as
soon
as
they
should
furnish
me
with
the
necessary
materials
and
advised
them
to
make
half
a
dozen
rat
traps
that
they
might
secure
the
water
rats
with
which
the
stream
abounded
and
whose
rich
glossy
fur
would
serve
admirably
for
felt
every
fifth
animal
that
they
brought
me
i
told
them
should
be
mine
that
i
might
obtain
material
for
a
hat
for
myself
and
their
mother
the
boys
at
once
agreed
to
this
arrangement
and
began
the
manufacture
of
the
traps
which
were
all
so
made
that
they
should
kill
the
rats
at
once
for
i
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
animals
being
tortured
or
imprisoned
while
they
were
thus
engaged
i
applied
myself
to
the
manufacture
of
porcelain
i
first
cleaned
the
pipeclay
and
talc
from
all
foreign
substances
and
made
them
ready
to
be
beaten
down
with
water
into
a
soft
mass
and
then
prepared
my
molds
of
gypsum
plaster
these
preparations
were
at
length
made
and
the
molds
received
a
thin
layer
of
the
porcelain
material
when
this
was
partly
baked
i
sprinkled
over
it
a
powder
of
colored
glass
beads
which
i
had
crushed
and
which
looked
very
pretty
in
patterns
upon
the
transparent

some
of

china
vessels
cracked
with
the
heat
of

stove
some
were
very
but
after
many
failures
i
succeeded
in
producing

of

a

half
a

i
must
allow
that
my
china
was
far
from
perfect
the
shape
of
some
of
the
vessels
was
faulty
and
none
were
really
transparent
nevertheless
the
general
appearance
gave
great
satisfaction
and
when
the
plates
were
filled
with
rosy
and
golden

resting
on
green

and

filled
the

chapter
xiv
building
the
cajack
a
plentiful
harvest
scarcely
had
i
completed
my
pottery
when
great
black
clouds
and
terrific
storms
heralded
the
approach
of
another
winter
the
rainy
season
having
set
in
we
were
compelled
to
give
up
our
daily
excursions
even
in
the
spacious
house
which
we
now
occupied
and
with
our
varied
and
interesting
employments
we
yet
found
the
time
dragging
heavily
the
spirits
of
all
were
depressed
and
even
occasional
rapid
rides
during
a
partial
cessation
of
the
rain
failed
permanently
to
arouse
them
fritz
as
well
as
i
had
perceived
this
and
he
said
to
me
why
father
should
we
not
make
a
canoe
something
swifter
and
more
manageable
than
those
vessels
we
as
yet
possess
i
often
long
for
a
light
skiff
in
which
i
might
skim
over
the
surface
of
the
water
the
idea
delighted
all
hands
but
the
mother
who
was
never
happy
when
we
were
on
the
sea
declared
that
our
chances
of
drowning
were
with
the
pinnace
and
canoe
already
sufficiently
great
and
that
there
was
not
the
slightest
necessity
for
our
adding
to
these
chances
by
constructing
another
craft
which
would
tempt
us
out
upon
the
perfidious
element
my
wife
fears
were
however
speedily
allayed
for
i
assured
her
that
the
boat
i
intended
to
construct
should
be
no
flimsy
but
as
safe
and
stout
a
craft
as
ever
floated
upon
the
sea
the
cajack
i
intended
to
be
my
model
and
i
resolved
not
only
to
occupy
the
children
but
also
to
produce
a
strong
and
serviceable
canoe
a
masterpiece
of
art
the
boys
were
interested
and
the
was
soon
in
operation
we
constructed
the
skeleton
of
whalebone
using
split
bamboo
canes
to
strengthen
the
sides
and
also
to
form
the
deck
which
extended
the
whole
length
of
the
boat
leaving
merely
a
square
hole
in
which
the
occupant
of
the
canoe
might
sit
the
work
engrossed
our
attention
almost
entirely
and
by
the
time
it
was
complete
the
rain
had
passed
away
and
the
glorious
sun
again
shone
brightly
forth
our
front
door
was
just
wide
enough
to
admit
of
the
egress
of
our
boat
and
we
completed
her
construction
in
the
open
air
we
quickly
cased
the
sides
and
deck
with
sealskin
making
all
the
seams
thoroughly
with
caoutchouc
the
cajack
was
indeed
a
curious
looking
craft
yet
so
light
that
she
might
be
lifted
easily
with
one
hand
and
when
at
length
we
launched
her
she
bounded
upon
the
water
like
an
india
rubber
ball
fritz
was
unanimously
voted
her
rightful
owner
but
before
his
mother
would
hear
of
his
entering
the
skiff
she
declared
that
she
must
contrive
a
swimming
dress
that
should
his
boat
receive
a
puncture
from
a
sharp
rock
or
the
dorsal
fin
of
a
fish
and
collapse
he
might
yet
have
a
chance
of
saving
his
life
though
i
did
not
consider
the
cajack
quite
the
soap
bubble
the
mother
imagined
it
i
yet
willingly
agreed
to
assist
her
in
the
construction
of
the
dress
the
garment
we
produced
was
most
curious
in
appearance
and
i
must
own
that
i
doubted
its
efficiency
it
was
like
a
double
waistcoat
made
of
linen
prepared
with
a
solution
of
india
rubber
the
seams
being
likewise
coated
with
caoutchouc
and
the
whole
rendered
perfectly
we
so
arranged
it
that
one
little
hole
was
left
by
means
of
which
air
could
be
forced
into
the
space
between
the
outer
covering
and
the
lining
and
the
dress
inflated
meanwhile
i
perceived
with
pleasure
the
rapid
vegetation
the
climate
was
producing
the
seeds
we
had
scattered
had
germinated
and
were
now
promising
magnificent
crops
the
veranda
too
was
looking
pleasant
with
its
gay
and
creepers
which
were
already
aspiring
to
the
summit
of
the
pillars
the
air
was
full
of
birds
the
earth
seemed
teeming
with
life
the
dress
was
at
length
completed
and
fritz
one
fine
afternoon
offered
publicly
to
prove
it
we
all
assembled
on
the
beach
the
boy
gravely
donned
and
inflated
the
garment
and
amid
roars
of
laughter
from
his
brothers
entered
the
water
quickly
and
easily
he
paddled
himself
across
the
bay
toward
shark
island
whither
we
followed
in
one
of
our
boats
the
experiment
was
most
successful
and
ernest
jack
and
franz
in
spite
of
their
laughter
at
their
brother
garment
begged
their
mother
to
make
for
each
of
them
a
similar
dress
while
on
the
island
we
paid
a
visit
to
the
colonists
whom
we
had
established
there
the
previous
autumn
all
were
well
we
could
perceive
by
the
footprints
that
the
antelopes
had
discovered
and
made
use
of
the
shelter
we
had
erected
for
them
and
feeling
that
we
could
do
nothing
more
we
scattered
handfuls
of
maize
and
salt
and
strolled
across
to
the
other
side
of
the
island
the
shore
was
covered
with
lovely
shells
many
of
which
with
beautiful
pieces
of
delicate
coral
the
boys
collected
for
their
museum
strewn
by
the
edge
of
the
water
too
lay
a
great
quantity
of
seaweed
of
various
colors
and
as
the
mother
declared
that
much
of
it
was
of
use
the
boys
assisted
her
to
collect
it
and
store
it
in
the
boat
as
we
pulled
back
to
the
land
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
my
wife
chose
from
among
the
seaweed
a
number
of
curious
leaves
with
edges
notched
like
a
saw
when
we
reached
home
she
carefully
washed
these
and
dried
them
in
the
oven
there
was
evidently
something
mysterious
about
this
preparation
and
my
curiosity
at
length
prompted
me
to
make
an
attempt
to
discover
the
secret
are
these
leaves
to
form
a
substitute
for
tobacco
said
i
do
you
so
long
for
its
refreshing
smell
my
wife
smiled
for
her
dislike
to
tobacco
was
well
known
and
she
answered
in
the
same
jocular
tone
do
you
not
think
that
a
mattress
stuffed
with
these
leaves
would
be
very
cool
in
summer
the
twinkle
in
her
eyes
showed
me
that
my
curiosity
must
still
remain
unsatisfied
but
it
nevertheless
became
greater
than
ever
the
boys
and
i
had
one
day
made
a
long
and
fatiguing
expedition
and
tired
out
we
flung
ourselves
down
in
the
veranda
as
we
lay
there
resting
we
heard
the
mother
voice
could
any
of
you
enjoy
a
little
jelly
she
presently
appeared
bearing
a
porcelain
dish
laden
with
most
lovely
transparent
jelly
cut
with
a
spoon
and
laid
before
us
it
quivered
and
glittered
in
the
light
ambrosia
exclaimed
fritz
tasting
it
it
was
indeed
delicious
and
still
marveling
from
whence
the
mother
could
have
obtained
a
dish
so
rare
we
disposed
of
all
that
she
had
set
before
us
aha
laughed
the
mother
is
not
this
an
excellent
substitute
for
tobacco
far
more
refreshing
than
the
nasty
weed
itself
behold
the
product
of
my
mysterious
seaweed
my
dear
wife
exclaimed
i
this
dish
is
indeed
a
masterpiece
of
culinary
art
but
where
had
you
met
with
it
what
put
it
into
your
head
while
staying
with
my
dutch
friends
at
the
cape
replied
she
i
often
saw
it
and
at
once
recognized
the
leaves
on
shark
island
once
knowing
the
secret
the
preparation
of
the
dish
is
extremely
simple
the
leaves
are
soaked
in
water
fresh
every
day
for
a
week
and
then
boiled
for
a
few
hours
with
orange
juice
citron
and
sugar
we
were
all
delighted
with
the
delicacy
and
thanked
the
mother
for
it
most
heartily
the
boys
declaring
that
they
must
at
once
go
off
again
to
the
island
to
collect
as
many
of
the
leaves
as
they
could
find
i
agreed
to
accompany
them
for
i
wished
to
examine
the
plantations
we
had
made
there
all
were
flourishing
the
palms
and
mangroves
had
shot
up
in
a
most
marvelous
manner
and
many
of
the
seeds
which
i
had
cast
at
random
among
the
cliffs
in
the
rocks
had
germinated
and
promised
to
clothe
the
nakedness
of
the
frowning
bowlders
away
up
among
the
rocks
too
we
discovered
a
bright
sparkling
spring
of
delicious
water
at
which
from
the
footprints
around
we
saw
that
the
antelopes
must
have
refreshed
themselves
finding
everything
so
satisfactory
we
were
naturally
anxious
to
discover
how
our
colony
and
plantations
on
whale
island
had
fared
it
was
evident
at
a
glance
that
the
rabbits
had
increased
the
young
and
tender
shoots
of
the
trees
bore
the
marks
of
many
greedy
mischievous
little
teeth
the
cocoanut
palms
alone
had
they
spared
such
depredations
as
these
could
not
be
allowed
and
with
the
help
of
the
boys
i
erected
round
each
stem
a
hedge
of
prickly
thorn
and
then
prepared
again
to
embark
before
we
did
so
however
i
noticed
that
some
of
the
seaweed
had
also
been
gnawed
by
the
rabbits
and
wondering
what
it
could
have
been
to
tempt
them
i
collected
some
of
it
to
examine
more
fully
at
home
the
skeleton
of
the
whale
too
attracted
our
attention
for
picked
clean
by
the
birds
and
bleached
by
the
sun
and
rain
the
bones
had
been
purified
to
a
most
perfect
whiteness
thinking
that
the
joints
of
the
vertebrae
might
be
made
of
use
i
separated
some
ten
or
twelve
and
rolled
them
down
to
the
boat
and
then
returned
to
the
shore
towing
them
after
us
a
scheme
now
occupied
my
mind
for
the
construction
of
a
crushing
machine
which
would
prove
of
the
greatest
service
to
us
i
knew
that
to
make
such
a
machine
of
stone
was
far
beyond
my
power
but
it
had
struck
me
that
the
vertebrae
of
the
whale
might
serve
my
purpose
i
determined
next
morning
to
look
out
a
tree
from
which
i
might
cut
the
blocks
of
wood
that
i
should
require
to
raise
my
crushers
my
expedition
was
destined
to
be
a
solitary
one
for
when
i
went
to
the
stables
for
a
horse
i
discovered
that
the
boys
had
gone
off
by
themselves
with
their
guns
and
traps
and
had
left
to
me
a
choice
between
the
bull
and
buffalo
with
storm
therefore
i
was
fain
to
be
content
i
crossed
the
bridge
but
as
i
reached
the
cassava
field
i
noticed
to
my
great
annoyance
that
it
had
been
overrun
and
laid
waste
by
some
mischievous
animals
i
examined
the
footprints
and
seeing
that
they
greatly
resembled
those
of
pigs
determined
to
follow
the
trail
and
see
who
these
invaders
of
our
territory
would
prove
to
be
the
track
led
me
on
for
some
way
until
i
almost
lost
sight
of
it
near
our
old
potato
field
for
some
time
i
hunted
backward
and
forward
without
seeing
a
sign
of
the
animals
at
length
a
loud
barking
from
floss
and
bruno
who
were
with
me
announced
that
they
had
been
discovered
the
whole
family
of
our
old
sow
and
she
herself
were
standing
at
bay
showing
their
teeth
and
grunting
so
savagely
that
the
dogs
feared
to
approach
them
i
raised
my
gun
and
fired
twice
among
the
herd
two
of
the
pigs
fell
and
the
rest
fled
followed
by
the
dogs
i
picked
up
the
pigs
and
calling
back
the
pursuers
continued
my
way
through
the
forest
a
tree
suited
to
my
purpose
was
soon
found
i
marked
it
and
returned
home
ernest
who
had
remained
at
home
assisted
me
to
flay
the
young
porkers
and
i
handed
them
over
to
the
mother
to
prepare
for
supper
by
which
time
i
hoped
the
other
lads
would
have
returned
late
in
the
evening
we
heard
the
sounds
of
trampling
hoofs
and
presently
jack
appeared
thundering
along
upon
his
steed
followed
in
the
distance
by
fritz
and
franz
these
latter
carried
upon
their
cruppers
game
bags
the
contents
of
which
were
speedily
displayed
four
birds
a
kangaroo
twenty
muskrats
a
monkey
two
hares
and
half
a
dozen
beaver
rats
were
laid
before
me
besides
these
fritz
threw
down
without
a
word
of
explanation
a
bundle
of
thistles
the
boys
seemed
almost
wild
with
excitement
at
the
success
of
their
expedition
and
presently
jack
exclaimed
oh
father
you
ca
think
what
grand
fun
hunting
on
an
ostrich
is
we
flew
along
like
the
wind
sometimes
i
could
scarcely
breathe
we
were
going
at
such
a
rate
and
was
obliged
to
shut
my
eyes
because
of
the
terrific
rush
of
air
really
father
you
must
make
me
a
mask
with
glass
eyes
to
ride
with
or
i
shall
be
blinded
one
of
these
fine
days
indeed
replied
i
i
must
do
no
such
thing
why
not
asked
he
with
a
look
of
amazement
upon
his
face
for
two
reasons
firstly
because
i
do
not
consider
that
i
do
anything
that
you
demand
and
secondly
because
i
think
that
you
are
very
capable
of
doing
it
yourself
however
i
must
congratulate
you
upon
your
abundant
supply
of
game
you
must
have
indeed
worked
hard
yet
i
wish
that
you
would
let
me
know
when
you
intend
starting
on
such
a
long
expedition
as
this
you
forget
that
though
you
yourselves
know
that
you
are
quite
safe
and
that
all
is
going
on
well
yet
that
we
at
home
are
kept
in
a
constant
state
of
anxiety
now
off
with
you
and
look
to
your
animals
and
then
you
may
find
supper
ready
presently
the
boys
returned
and
we
prepared
for
a
most
appetizing
meal
which
the
mother
set
before
us
while
we
were
discussing
the
roast
pig
and
washing
it
down
with
fragrant
mead
fritz
described
the
day
expedition
they
had
set
their
traps
near
woodlands
and
had
there
captured
the
muskrats
attracting
them
with
small
carrots
while
with
other
traps
baited
with
fish
and
earthworms
they
had
caught
several
beaver
rats
and
a
platypus
hunting
and
fishing
had
occupied
the
rest
of
the
day
and
it
was
with
immense
pride
that
jack
displayed
the
kangaroo
which
he
had
run
down
with
his
swift
courser
contributions
to
the
garden
had
not
been
forgotten
and
fritz
handed
over
to
his
mother
several
cuttings
from
cinnamon
and
trees
finally
when
all
the
other
treasures
had
been
displayed
fritz
begged
me
to
examine
his
thistles
which
he
had
gathered
thinking
he
said
that
it
was
a
plant
used
in
the
manufacture
of
wool
he
was
perfectly
right
for
i
recognized
it
at
once
as
the
fuller
teazle
a
plant
whose
sharp
little
thorns
which
cover
the
stem
and
leaves
are
used
to
raise
the
nap
of
cloth
we
resolved
to
be
up
betimes
the
following
morning
that
we
might
attend
to
the
preparation
of
the
booty
and
as
i
now
noticed
that
the
boys
were
all
becoming
extremely
drowsy
i
closed
the
day
with
evening
devotions
the
number
of
the
creatures
we
killed
rendered
the
removal
of
their
skins
a
matter
of
no
little
time
and
trouble
it
was
not
an
agreeable
task
at
any
time
and
when
i
saw
the
array
of
animals
the
boys
had
brought
me
to
flay
i
determined
to
construct
a
machine
which
would
considerably
lessen
the
labor
among
the
ship
stores
in
the
chest
i
discovered
a
large
syringe
this
with
a
few
alterations
would
serve
my
purpose
admirably
within
the
tube
i
first
fitted
a
couple
of
valves
and
then
perforating
the
stopper
i
had
in
my
possession
a
powerful
air
pump
the
boys
stared
at
me
in
blank
amazement
when
armed
with
this
instrument
i
took
up
the
kangaroo
and
declared
myself
ready
to
commence
operations
skin
a
kangaroo
with
a
squirt
said
they
and
a
roar
of
laughter
followed
the
remark
i
made
no
reply
to
the
jests
which
followed
but
silently
hung
the
kangaroo
by
its
hind
legs
to
the
branch
of
a
tree
i
then
made
a
small
incision
in
the
skin
and
inserting
the
mouth
of
the
syringe
forced
air
with
all
my
might
between
the
skin
and
the
body
of
the
animal
by
degrees
the
hide
of
the
kangaroo
distended
altering
the
shape
of
the
creature
entirely
still
i
worked
on
forcing
in
yet
more
air
until
it
had
become
a
mere
shapeless
mass
and
i
soon
found
that
the
skin
was
almost
entirely
separated
from
the
carcass
a
bold
cut
down
the
belly
and
a
few
touches
here
and
there
where
the
ligatures
still
bound
the
hide
to
the
body
and
the
animal
was
flayed
what
a
splendid
plan
cried
the
boys
but
why
should
it
do
it
for
a
most
simple
and
natural
reason
i
replied
do
you
not
know
that
the
skin
of
an
animal
is
attached
to
its
flesh
merely
by
slender
and
delicate
fibers
and
that
between
these
exist
thousands
of
little
bladders
or
air
chambers
by
forcing
air
into
these
bladders
the
fibers
are
stretched
and
at
length
elastic
as
they
are
cracked
the
skin
has
now
nothing
to
unite
it
to
the
body
and
consequently
may
be
drawn
off
with
perfect
ease
this
scientific
fact
has
been
known
for
many
years
the
greenlanders
make
constant
use
of
it
when
they
have
killed
a
seal
or
walrus
they
distend
the
skin
that
they
may
tow
the
animal
more
easily
ashore
and
then
remove
its
hide
at
a
moment
notice
the
remaining
animals
were
subjected
to
the
same
treatment
and
to
my
great
joy
in
a
couple
of
days
the
skins
were
all
off
and
being
prepared
for
use
i
now
summoned
the
boys
to
assist
me
in
procuring
blocks
of
wood
for
my
crushing
machine
and
the
following
day
we
set
forth
with
saws
ropes
axes
and
other
tools
we
soon
reached
the
tree
i
had
selected
for
my
purpose
and
i
began
by
sending
fritz
and
jack
up
into
the
tree
with
axes
to
cut
off
the
larger
of
the
high
branches
that
when
the
tree
fell
it
might
not
injure
its
neighbors
they
then
descended
and
fritz
and
i
attacked
the
stem
as
the
easiest
and
most
speedy
method
we
used
a
saw
such
a
one
as
is
employed
by
sawyers
in
a
and
fritz
taking
one
end
and
i
the
other
the
tree
was
soon
cut
half
through
we
then
adjusted
ropes
that
we
might
guide
its
fall
and
again
began
to
cut
it
was
laborious
work
but
when
i
considered
that
the
cut
was
sufficiently
deep
we
took
the
ropes
and
pulled
with
our
united
strength
the
trunk
cracked
swayed
tottered
and
fell
with
a
crash
the
boughs
were
speedily
lopped
off
and
the
trunk
sawed
into
blocks
four
feet
long
to
cut
down
and
divide
this
tree
had
taken
us
a
couple
of
days
and
on
the
third
we
carted
home
four
large
and
two
small
blocks
and
with
the
vertebrae
joints
of
the
whale
i
in
a
very
short
time
completed
my
machine
while
engaged
on
this
undertaking
i
had
paid
little
attention
to
our
fields
of
grain
and
accordingly
great
was
my
surprise
when
one
evening
the
fowls
returned
showing
most
evident
indifference
to
their
evening
meal
and
with
their
crops
perfectly
full
it
suddenly
struck
me
that
these
birds
had
come
from
the
direction
of
our
cornfield
i
hurried
off
to
see
what
damage
they
had
done
and
then
found
to
my
great
joy
that
the
grain
was
perfectly
ripe
the
amount
of
work
before
us
startled
my
wife
this
unexpected
harvest
which
added
reaping
and
threshing
to
the
fishing
salting
and
pickling
already
on
hand
quite
troubled
her
only
think
said
she
of
my
beloved
potatoes
and
manioc
roots
what
is
to
become
of
them
i
should
like
to
know
it
is
time
to
take
them
up
and
how
to
manage
it
with
all
this
press
of
work
i
ca
see
do
be
wife
said
i
there
is
no
immediate
hurry
about
the
manioc
and
digging
potatoes
in
this
fine
light
soil
is
easy
work
compared
to
what
it
is
in
switzerland
while
as
to
planting
more
that
will
not
be
necessary
if
we
leave
the
younger
plants
in
the
ground
the
harvest
we
must
conduct
after
the
italian
fashion
which
although
anything
but
economical
will
save
time
and
trouble
and
as
we
are
to
have
two
crops
in
the
year
we
need
not
be
too
particular
without
further
delay
i
commenced
leveling
a
large
space
of
firm
clayey
ground
to
act
as
a
threshing
floor
it
was
well
sprinkled
with
water
rolled
beaten
and
stamped
as
the
sun
dried
the
moisture
it
was
watered
anew
and
the
treatment
continued
until
it
became
as
flat
hard
and
smooth
as
threshing
floor
need
be
our
largest
wicker
basket
was
then
slung
between
storm
and
grumble
we
armed
ourselves
with
reaping
hooks
and
went
forth
to
gather
in
the
corn
in
the
simplest
and
most
expeditious
manner
imaginable
i
told
my
reapers
not
to
concern
themselves
about
the
length
of
the
straw
but
to
grasp
the
corn
where
it
was
convenient
to
them
without
stooping
each
was
to
wind
a
stalk
around
his
own
handful
and
throw
it
into
the
basket
in
this
way
great
labor
was
saved
the
plan
pleased
the
boys
immensely
and
in
a
short
time
the
basket
had
been
filled
many
times
and
the
field
displayed
a
quantity
of
tall
headless
stubble
which
perfectly
horrified
the
mother
so
extravagant
and
untidy
did
she
consider
our
work
this
is
dreadful
cried
she
you
have
left
numbers
of
ears
growing
on
short
stalks
and
look
at
that
splendid
straw
completely
wasted
i
approve
of
your
italian
fashion
at
all
it
is
not
a
bad
plan
i
can
assure
you
wife
and
the
italians
do
not
waste
the
straw
by
not
cutting
it
with
the
grain
having
more
arable
than
pasture
land
they
use
this
high
stubble
for
their
cattle
letting
them
feed
in
it
and
eat
what
grain
is
left
afterward
allowing
the
grass
to
grow
up
among
it
they
mow
all
together
for
winter
fodder
and
now
for
threshing
also
in
italian
fashion
we
shall
find
it
spare
our
arms
and
backs
as
much
in
that
as
in
reaping
the
little
sheaves
were
laid
in
a
large
circle
on
the
floor
the
boys
mounted
storm
grumble
lightfoot
and
hurry
starting
off
at
a
brisk
trot
with
many
a
merry
jest
and
round
they
went
trampling
and
stamping
out
the
grain
while
dust
and
chaff
flew
in
clouds
about
them
my
wife
and
i
were
incessantly
occupied
with
by
means
of
which
we
shook
up
and
moved
the
sheaves
over
which
the
threshers
rode
so
as
to
throw
them
in
the
track
from
time
to
time
the
animals
took
mouthfuls
of
the
tempting
food
they
were
beating
out
we
thought
they
well
deserved
it
and
called
to
mind
the
command
given
to
the
jews
thou
shalt
not
muzzle
the
ox
that
treadeth
out
the
corn
after
threshing
we
proceeded
to
winnowing
by
simply
throwing
the
threshed
corn
with
shovels
high
in
the
air
when
the
land
or
blew
strong
the
chaff
and
refuse
was
carried
away
by
the
wind
and
the
grain
fell
to
the
ground
during
these
operations
our
poultry
paid
the
many
visits
testifying
a
lively
interest
in
the
success
of
our
labors
and
gobbling
up
the
grain
at
such
a
rate
that
my
wife
was
obliged
to
keep
them
at
a
reasonable
distance
but
i
would
not
have
them
altogether
stinted
in
the
midst
of
our
plenty
i
said
let
them
enjoy
themselves
what
we
lose
in
grain
we
gain
in
flesh
i
anticipate
delicious
roast
goose
and
boiled
turkey
when
our
harvest
stores
were
housed
we
found
that
we
had
reaped
sixty
eighty
even
a
hundred
fold
what
had
been
sown
our
garner
was
truly
filled
with
all
manner
of
store
expecting
a
second
harvest
we
were
constrained
to
prepare
the
field
for
sowing
again
and
immediately
therefore
commenced
mowing
down
the
stubble
while
engaged
in
this
flocks
of
quails
and
partridges
came
to
glean
among
the
scattered
ears
we
did
not
secure
any
great
number
but
resolved
to
be
prepared
for
them
next
season
and
by
spreading
nets
to
catch
them
in
large
quantities
my
wife
was
satisfied
when
she
saw
the
straw
carried
home
and
stacked
our
crop
of
maize
which
of
course
had
not
been
threshed
like
the
other
corn
afforded
soft
leaves
which
were
used
for
stuffing
mattresses
while
the
stalks
when
burnt
left
ashes
so
rich
in
alkali
as
to
be
especially
useful
i
changed
the
crops
sown
on
the
ground
to
rye
barley
and
oats
and
hoped
they
would
ripen
before
the
rainy
season
the
shoals
of
herring
made
their
appearance
just
as
we
finished
our
agricultural
operations
this
year
we
pickled
only
two
barrels
of
them
but
we
were
not
so
merciful
toward
the
seals
which
arrived
on
the
coast
directly
afterward
we
hunted
them
vigorously
requiring
their
skins
for
many
purposes
more
especially
for
the
completion
of
the
cajack
on
the
little
deck
of
that
tiny
vessel
i
had
made
a
kind
of
magazine
in
which
to
store
pistols
ammunition
water
and
provisions
and
this
i
meant
to
cover
with
sealskin
so
as
to
be
quite
a
couple
of
harpoons
furnished
with
seal
bladders
were
to
be
suspended
alongside
chapter
xv
adventures
of
the
boys
at
woodlands
the
elephant
trail
at
last
came
the
day
when
fritz
was
to
make
his
trial
trip
with
the
cajack
completely
equipped
in
swimming
costume
trousers
jacket
and
cap
it
was
most
ludicrous
to
see
him
cower
down
in
the
canoe
and
puff
and
blow
till
he
began
to
swell
like
the
frog
in
the
fable
all
trace
of
his
original
figure
was
speedily
lost
and
shouts
of
laughter
greeted
his
comical
appearance
even
his
mother
could
not
resist
a
smile
although
the
dress
was
her
invention
i
got
the
other
boat
out
that
my
wife
might
see
we
were
ready
to
go
to
his
assistance
the
moment
it
became
necessary
the
cajack
was
launched
from
a
convenient
shelving
point
and
floated
lightly
on
the
ocean
mirror
fritz
with
his
paddles
then
began
to
practice
all
manner
of
evolutions
darting
along
with
arrowy
swiftness
wheeling
to
the
right
then
to
the
left
and
at
last
flinging
himself
quite
on
his
side
while
his
mother
uttered
a
shriek
of
terror
he
showed
that
the
tiny
craft
would
neither
capsize
nor
sink
then
recovering
his
balance
he
sped
securely
on
his
further
way
encouraged
by
our
shouts
of
approbation
he
now
boldly
ventured
into
the
strong
current
of
jackal
river
and
was
rapidly
carried
out
to
sea
this
being
more
than
i
had
bargained
for
i
lost
no
time
in
giving
chase
in
the
boat
with
ernest
and
jack
my
wife
urging
us
to
greater
speed
and
declaring
that
some
accident
could
not
fail
to
happen
to
that
horrid
we
soon
arrived
outside
the
bay
at
the
rocks
where
formerly
lay
the
wreck
and
gazed
in
all
directions
for
signs
of
the
after
a
time
we
saw
at
a
considerable
distance
a
faint
puff
of
smoke
followed
by
the
crack
of
a
pistol
upon
this
we
fired
a
signal
shot
which
was
presently
answered
by
another
and
steering
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
we
soon
heard
the
boy
cheery
halloo
the
cajack
darted
from
behind
a
point
of
land
and
we
quickly
joined
company
come
to
this
rocky
beach
cried
fritz
i
have
something
to
show
you
with
blank
amazement
we
beheld
a
fine
young
walrus
harpooned
and
quite
dead
did
you
kill
this
creature
my
dear
fritz
i
exclaimed
looking
round
in
some
anxiety
and
half
expecting
to
see
a
naked
savage
come
to
claim
the
prize
to
be
sure
father
do
you
see
my
harpoon
why
do
you
doubt
it
well
i
scarcely
know
replied
i
laughing
but
success
so
speedy
so
unexpected
and
so
appropriate
to
an
amateur
greenlander
took
me
by
surprise
i
congratulate
you
my
boy
but
i
must
tell
you
that
you
have
alarmed
us
by
making
this
long
trip
you
should
not
have
gone
out
of
the
bay
i
left
your
mother
in
grievous
trouble
indeed
father
i
had
no
idea
of
passing
out
of
sight
out
once
in
the
current
i
was
carried
along
and
could
not
help
myself
then
i
came
on
a
herd
of
walruses
and
i
did
so
long
to
make
a
prize
of
one
that
i
forgot
everything
else
and
made
chase
after
them
when
beyond
the
influence
of
the
current
until
i
got
near
enough
to
harpoon
this
fine
fellow
he
swam
more
slowly
and
i
struck
him
a
second
time
then
he
sought
refuge
among
these
rocks
and
expired
i
landed
and
scrambled
to
where
he
lay
but
i
took
care
to
give
him
the
contents
of
my
pistol
before
going
close
up
having
a
salutary
recollection
of
the
big
serpent
parting
fling
at
you
jack
illustration
the
walrus
sought
refuge
among
these
you
ran
a
very
great
risk
said
i
the
walrus
is
an
inoffensive
creature
but
when
attacked
and
wounded
it
often
becomes
furious
and
turning
upon
its
pursuer
can
destroy
with
its
long
tusks
a
strongly
built
whale
boat
however
thank
god
for
your
safety
i
value
that
above
a
thousand
such
creatures
now
what
to
be
done
with
him
he
must
be
quite
fourteen
feet
long
although
not
full
grown
i
am
very
glad
you
followed
me
father
said
fritz
but
our
united
strength
will
not
remove
this
prodigious
weight
from
among
these
rocks
only
do
let
me
carry
away
the
head
with
these
grand
tusks
i
should
so
like
to
fasten
it
on
the
prow
of
the
cajack
and
name
it
the
we
must
certainly
carry
away
the
beautiful
ivory
tusks
said
i
but
make
haste
the
air
feels
so
excessively
close
and
sultry
i
think
a
storm
is
brewing
but
the
head
the
head
we
must
have
the
whole
head
cried
jack
just
think
how
splendid
it
will
look
on
the
cajack
and
how
splendid
it
will
smell
too
when
it
begins
to
putrefy
added
ernest
what
a
treat
for
the
steersman
oh
we
will
prepare
for
that
said
fritz
it
shall
be
soaked
and
cleaned
and
dried
until
it
is
as
hard
as
a
wooden
model
it
shall
not
offend
your
delicate
nose
in
the
least
ernest
i
supposed
the
walrus
to
be
an
animal
peculiar
to
the
arctic
regions
remarked
ernest
and
so
it
is
i
replied
though
they
may
occasionally
be
seen
elsewhere
these
may
have
wandered
from
the
antarctic
seas
i
know
that
on
the
eastern
coast
of
africa
is
found
a
smaller
species
of
walrus
called
the
dugong
it
has
long
incisor
teeth
but
not
tusks
and
certainly
resembles
a
seal
rather
than
a
walrus
while
thus
speaking
we
were
actively
engaged
in
the
decapitation
of
the
walrus
and
in
cutting
off
long
strips
of
its
skin
this
took
some
time
as
we
had
not
the
proper
implements
and
fritz
remarked
that
in
future
the
cajack
must
be
provided
with
a
and
a
hatchet
adding
that
he
should
like
to
have
a
small
compass
in
a
box
with
a
glass
top
fixed
in
front
of
the
hole
where
the
steersman
sits
i
saw
the
necessity
of
this
and
i
promised
it
should
be
done
our
work
being
accomplished
we
were
ready
to
go
and
i
proposed
to
take
fritz
and
the
canoe
on
board
our
boat
so
that
we
might
all
arrive
together
but
i
yielded
to
his
earnest
wish
to
return
alone
as
he
came
he
longed
to
act
as
our
and
announce
our
approach
to
his
mother
so
he
was
soon
skimming
away
over
the
surface
of
the
water
while
we
followed
at
a
slower
rate
black
clouds
meanwhile
gathered
thick
and
fast
around
us
and
a
tremendous
storm
came
on
fritz
was
out
of
sight
and
beyond
our
reach
we
buckled
on
the
swimming
belts
and
firmly
lashed
ourselves
to
the
boat
so
that
we
might
not
be
washed
overboard
by
the
towering
seas
which
broke
over
it
the
horizon
was
shrouded
in
darkness
fearful
gusts
of
wind
lashed
the
ocean
into
foam
rain
descended
in
torrents
while
livid
lightning
glared
athwart
the
gloom
both
my
boys
faced
the
danger
nobly
and
my
feelings
of
alarm
were
mingled
with
hope
on
finding
how
well
the
boat
behaved
the
tempest
swept
on
its
way
and
the
sky
began
to
clear
as
suddenly
as
it
had
been
overcast
yet
the
stormy
waves
continued
for
a
long
time
to
threaten
our
frail
bark
with
destruction
in
spite
of
its
buoyancy
and
steadiness
yet
i
never
lost
hope
for
ourselves
all
my
fears
were
for
fritz
in
fact
i
gave
him
up
for
lost
and
my
whole
agonized
heart
arose
in
prayer
for
strength
to
say
thy
will
be
done
at
last
we
rounded
the
point
and
once
more
entering
safety
bay
quickly
drew
near
the
little
harbor
what
was
our
surprise
our
overwhelming
delight
when
there
we
saw
the
mother
with
fritz
as
well
as
her
little
boy
on
their
knees
in
prayer
so
earnest
for
our
deliverance
that
our
approach
was
unperceived
until
with
cries
of
joy
we
attracted
their
notice
then
indeed
ensued
a
happy
meeting
and
we
gave
thanks
together
for
the
mercy
which
had
spared
our
lives
returning
joyfully
to
rockburg
we
changed
our
drenched
garments
for
warm
dry
clothes
and
seated
at
a
comfortable
meal
considered
and
described
at
our
ease
the
perils
of
the
storm
afterward
the
head
of
the
walrus
was
conveyed
to
our
workshop
where
it
underwent
such
a
skillful
and
thorough
process
of
cleaning
embalming
and
drying
that
ere
long
it
was
actually
fixed
on
the
prow
of
the
cajack
and
a
most
imposing
appearance
it
presented
the
strips
of
hide
when
and
prepared
made
valuable
leather
much
damage
had
been
done
by
the
late
storm
the
heavy
rain
had
flooded
all
the
streams
and
injured
crops
which
should
have
been
housed
before
the
regular
rainy
season
the
bridge
over
jackal
river
was
partly
broken
down
and
the
water
tanks
and
pipes
all
needed
repair
so
our
time
was
much
occupied
in
restoring
things
to
order
on
going
to
work
one
day
near
the
cascade
we
found
a
great
number
of
dark
red
berries
scattered
on
the
ground
they
were
about
the
size
of
ordinary
hazel
nuts
with
small
leafy
coronets
at
the
tip
the
boys
thought
them
so
inviting
that
they
tasted
them
at
once
but
angry
exclamations
and
much
spitting
and
spluttering
followed
the
experiment
even
knips
rejected
them
and
they
would
have
been
cast
aside
with
contempt
had
not
the
smell
induced
me
to
examine
them
i
decided
that
this
was
the
fruit
of
the
clove
some
plants
were
immediately
set
in
the
nursery
garden
and
my
wife
was
pleased
to
have
this
excellent
spice
wherewith
to
flavor
her
boiled
rice
and
other
dishes
in
lieu
of
pepper
a
very
welcome
variety
to
everyone
having
a
good
supply
of
clay
brought
from
the
bed
near
falconhurst
i
proposed
to
use
it
for
making
aqueducts
and
observing
how
much
the
recent
rain
had
promoted
the
growth
of
our
young
corn
i
determined
to
irrigate
the
fields
with
the
drainage
from
our
crushing
mill
the
fishing
season
was
again
successful
large
takes
of
salmon
sturgeon
and
herring
rewarded
our
annual
exertions
and
our
storeroom
again
assumed
a
appearance
much
as
i
wished
that
we
could
obtain
a
constant
supply
of
these
fish
fresh
i
was
obliged
to
reject
the
naïve
proposal
from
jack
that
we
should
tether
a
shoal
of
salmon
by
the
gills
to
the
bottom
of
the
bay
as
we
had
secured
the
turtles
many
quiet
uneventful
days
passed
by
and
i
perceived
that
the
boys
wearied
by
the
routine
of
farm
work
at
rockburg
were
longing
for
a
cruise
in
the
yacht
or
an
expedition
into
the
woods
which
would
refresh
both
mind
and
body
father
said
fritz
at
length
we
want
a
quantity
of
hurdles
and
have
scarcely
any
more
bamboos
of
which
to
make
them
had
we
not
better
get
a
supply
from
woodlands
and
you
said
too
the
other
day
that
you
wished
you
had
some
more
of
the
fine
clay
we
might
visit
the
gap
at
the
same
time
i
had
really
no
objection
to
propose
and
it
was
shortly
afterward
settled
that
fritz
jack
and
franz
should
start
together
and
that
ernest
who
had
no
great
desire
to
accompany
his
brothers
should
remain
with
his
mother
and
me
and
assist
in
the
construction
of
a
sugar
mill
the
erection
of
which
i
had
long
contemplated
before
they
started
fritz
begged
some
bear
meat
from
the
mother
to
make
pemmican
and
what
may
pemmican
be
she
asked
it
is
food
carried
by
the
of
north
america
on
their
long
journeys
through
the
wild
country
they
traverse
and
consists
of
bear
or
deer
flesh
first
cooked
and
then
pounded
or
ground
to
powder
it
is
very
portable
and
nourishing
his
mother
consented
to
humor
him
as
she
said
although
without
much
faith
in
the
value
of
the
preparation
and
in
the
course
of
two
days
a
stock
of
pemmican
sufficient
for
a
polar
expedition
was
fabricated
by
our
enthusiastic
son
they
were
ready
to
start
when
i
observed
jack
quietly
slip
a
basket
containing
several
pigeons
under
the
packages
in
the
cart
oh
oh
thought
i
the
little
fellow
has
his
doubts
about
that
pemmican
and
thinks
a
tough
old
pigeon
would
be
preferable
the
weather
was
exquisite
and
with
exhortations
to
prudence
and
caution
from
both
me
and
their
mother
the
three
lads
started
in
the
very
highest
spirits
storm
and
grumble
as
usual
drew
the
cart
and
were
ridden
by
fritz
and
franz
while
hurry
carried
jack
swiftly
across
the
bridge
in
advance
of
them
followed
by
floss
and
bruno
barking
at
his
heels
the
sugar
mill
occupied
us
for
several
days
and
was
made
so
much
like
our
other
mills
that
i
need
not
now
describe
it
on
the
evening
of
the
first
day
as
we
sat
resting
in
the
porch
at
rockburg
we
naturally
talked
of
the
absentees
wondering
and
guessing
what
they
might
be
about
ernest
looked
rather
mysterious
and
hinted
that
he
might
have
news
of
them
next
morning
just
then
a
bird
alighted
on
the
dovecot
and
entered
i
could
not
see
in
the
failing
light
whether
it
was
one
of
our
own
pigeons
or
an
intruder
ernest
started
up
and
said
he
would
see
that
all
was
right
in
a
few
minutes
he
returned
with
a
scrap
of
paper
in
his
hand
news
father
the
very
latest
news
by
pigeon
post
mother
well
done
boys
what
a
capital
idea
said
i
and
taking
the
note
i
read
dearest
parents
and
ernest
a
brute
of
a
hyena
has
killed
a
ram
and
two
lambs
the
dogs
seized
it
franz
shot
it
it
is
dead
and
skinned
the
pemmican
is
worth
much
but
we
are
all
right
love
to
all
fritz
woodlands
instant
a
true
hunter
letter
laughed
i
but
what
exciting
news
when
does
the
next
post
come
in
ernest
i
hope
said
he
while
his
mother
sighed
and
doubted
the
value
of
such
glimpses
into
the
scenes
of
danger
through
which
her
sons
were
passing
declaring
she
would
much
rather
wait
and
hear
all
about
it
when
she
had
them
safe
home
again
thus
the
winged
kept
us
informed
from
day
to
day
of
the
outline
of
adventures
which
were
afterward
more
fully
described
on
approaching
the
farm
at
woodlands
the
boys
were
startled
by
hearing
as
they
thought
human
laughter
repeated
again
and
again
while
to
their
astonishment
the
oxen
testified
the
greatest
uneasiness
the
dogs
growled
and
drew
close
to
their
masters
and
the
ostrich
fairly
bolted
with
jack
into
the
rice
swamp
the
laughter
continued
and
the
beasts
became
unmanageable
something
is
very
far
wrong
cried
fritz
i
can
not
leave
the
animals
but
while
i
unharness
them
do
you
franz
take
the
dogs
and
advance
cautiously
to
see
what
is
the
matter
without
a
moment
hesitation
franz
made
his
way
among
the
bushes
with
his
gun
closely
followed
by
the
dogs
until
through
an
opening
in
the
thicket
he
could
see
at
a
distance
of
about
forty
paces
an
enormous
hyena
in
the
most
wonderful
state
of
excitement
dancing
round
a
lamb
just
killed
and
uttering
from
time
to
time
the
ghastly
hysterical
laughter
which
had
pealed
through
the
forest
the
beast
kept
running
backward
and
forward
rising
on
its
hind
legs
and
then
rapidly
whirling
round
and
round
nodding
its
head
and
going
through
most
frantic
and
ludicrous
antics
franz
kept
his
presence
of
mind
very
well
for
he
watched
till
calming
down
the
hyena
began
with
horrid
growls
to
tear
its
prey
and
then
firing
steadily
both
barrels
he
broke
its
foreleg
and
wounded
it
in
the
breast
meanwhile
fritz
having
unyoked
the
oxen
and
secured
them
to
trees
hurried
to
his
brother
assistance
the
dogs
and
the
dying
hyena
were
by
this
time
engaged
in
mortal
strife
but
the
latter
although
it
severely
wounded
both
floss
and
bruno
speedily
succumbed
and
was
dead
when
the
boys
reached
the
spot
they
raised
a
shout
of
triumph
which
guided
jack
to
the
scene
of
action
and
their
first
care
was
for
the
dogs
whose
wounds
they
dressed
before
minutely
examining
the
hyena
it
was
as
large
as
a
wild
boar
long
stiff
bristles
formed
a
mane
on
its
neck
its
color
was
gray
marked
with
black
the
teeth
and
jaws
were
of
extraordinary
strength
the
thighs
muscular
and
sinewy
the
claws
remarkably
strong
and
sharp
altogether
but
for
his
wounds
he
would
certainly
have
been
more
than
a
match
for
the
dogs
after
unloading
the
cart
at
the
farm
the
boys
returned
for
the
carcass
of
the
as
it
is
sometimes
called
and
occupied
themselves
in
skinning
it
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
when
after
dispatching
the
to
rockburg
they
retired
to
rest
on
their
bearskin
rugs
to
dream
of
adventures
past
and
future
the
following
day
they
devised
no
less
a
scheme
than
to
survey
the
shores
of
wood
lake
and
place
marks
wherever
the
surrounding
marsh
was
practicable
and
might
be
crossed
either
to
reach
the
water
or
leave
it
fritz
in
the
cajack
and
the
boys
on
shore
carefully
examined
the
ground
together
and
when
they
found
firm
footing
to
the
water
edge
the
spot
was
indicated
by
planting
a
tall
bamboo
bearing
on
high
a
bundle
of
reeds
and
branches
they
succeeded
in
capturing
three
young
black
swans
after
considerable
resistance
from
the
old
ones
they
were
afterward
brought
to
rockburg
and
detained
as
ornaments
to
safety
bay
presently
a
beautiful
heron
thrust
his
long
neck
from
among
the
reeds
to
ascertain
what
all
the
noise
on
the
lake
was
about
before
he
could
satisfy
his
curiosity
fritz
unhooded
his
eagle
and
though
vainly
he
flapped
and
struggled
his
legs
and
wings
were
gently
but
firmly
bound
and
he
had
to
own
himself
vanquished
and
submit
to
the
inspection
of
his
delighted
captors
it
was
their
turn
to
be
alarmed
next
for
a
large
powerful
animal
came
puffing
with
a
curious
whistling
sound
through
the
dense
thicket
of
reeds
passing
close
by
and
sorely
discomposing
them
by
its
sudden
appearance
it
was
out
of
sight
immediately
before
they
could
summon
the
dogs
and
from
their
description
it
must
have
been
a
tapir
the
color
dark
brown
and
in
form
resembling
a
young
rhinoceros
but
with
no
horn
on
the
nose
and
the
upper
lip
prolonged
into
a
trunk
something
like
that
of
an
elephant
on
a
smaller
scale
it
is
a
gentle
creature
but
when
attacked
becomes
a
fierce
opponent
and
can
wound
dogs
dangerously
with
its
powerful
teeth
the
tapir
can
swim
and
dive
with
perfect
ease
and
abounds
in
the
densely
wooded
swamps
and
rivers
of
tropical
america
fritz
in
his
cajack
followed
for
a
time
the
direction
in
which
the
tapir
proceeded
but
saw
no
more
of
it
meanwhile
the
other
two
boys
returned
to
the
farm
by
the
rice
fields
and
there
fell
in
with
a
flock
of
cranes
five
or
six
of
which
they
caught
alive
among
them
two
demoiselles
or
numidian
cranes
these
birds
they
shot
at
with
arrows
arranged
in
a
skillful
and
original
way
with
loops
of
cord
dipped
in
birdlime
attached
to
them
so
that
it
often
happened
that
the
bird
aimed
at
was
entangled
and
brought
down
uninjured
the
young
hunters
seemed
to
have
lived
very
comfortably
on
peccary
ham
cassava
bread
and
fruit
and
plenty
of
baked
potatoes
and
milk
one
trial
of
the
pemmican
was
sufficient
and
it
was
handed
over
to
the
dogs
fritz
however
determined
again
to
attempt
the
manufacture
knowing
its
value
when
properly
prepared
after
collecting
a
supply
of
rice
and
cotton
they
took
their
way
to
prospect
hill
and
said
fritz
as
he
afterward
vividly
described
the
dreadful
scene
there
enacted
when
we
entered
the
pine
wood
we
found
it
in
possession
of
troops
of
monkeys
who
resolved
to
make
our
passage
through
it
as
disagreeable
as
possible
for
they
howled
and
chattered
at
us
like
demons
pelting
us
as
hard
as
they
could
with
pine
cones
they
became
so
unbearable
that
at
last
we
fired
a
few
shot
right
and
left
among
them
several
bit
the
dust
the
rest
fled
and
we
continued
our
way
in
peace
to
prospect
hill
but
only
to
discover
the
havoc
the
wretches
had
made
there
would
you
believe
it
father
the
pleasant
cottage
had
been
overrun
and
ruined
by
apes
just
as
woodlands
last
summer
the
most
dreadful
dirt
and
disorder
met
our
eyes
wherever
we
turned
and
we
had
hard
work
to
make
the
place
fit
for
human
habitation
and
even
then
we
preferred
the
tent
i
felt
quite
at
a
loss
how
to
guard
the
farm
for
the
future
but
seeing
a
bottle
of
the
poisonous
gum
of
the
euphorbia
in
the
tool
chest
i
devised
a
plan
for
the
destruction
of
the
apes
which
succeeded
beyond
my
expectations
i
mixed
poison
with
milk
bruised
millet
and
anything
i
thought
the
monkeys
would
eat
and
put
it
in
cocoanut
shells
which
i
hung
about
in
the
trees
high
enough
to
be
out
of
reach
of
our
own
animals
the
evening
was
calm
and
lovely
the
sea
murmured
in
the
distance
and
the
rising
moon
shed
a
beauty
over
the
landscape
which
we
seemed
never
before
to
have
so
admired
and
enjoyed
the
summer
night
closed
around
us
in
all
its
solemn
stillness
and
our
deepest
feelings
were
touched
when
suddenly
the
spell
was
broken
by
an
of
the
most
hideous
and
discordant
noises
as
by
one
consent
every
beast
of
the
forest
seemed
to
arise
from
its
den
and
utter
its
wild
nocturnal
cry
snorting
snarling
and
shrieking
filled
the
wood
beneath
us
from
the
hills
echoed
the
mournful
howl
of
jackals
answered
by
fangs
in
the
yard
who
was
backed
up
by
the
barking
and
yelping
of
his
friends
floss
and
bruno
far
away
beyond
the
rocky
fastnesses
of
the
gap
sounded
unearthly
hollow
snortings
and
neighings
reminding
one
of
the
strange
cry
of
the
hippopotamus
above
these
occasional
deep
majestic
roaring
made
our
hearts
quail
with
the
conviction
that
we
heard
the
voices
of
lions
and
elephants
overawed
and
silent
we
retired
to
rest
hoping
to
forget
in
sleep
the
terrors
of
the
midnight
forest
but
ere
long
the
most
fearful
cries
in
the
adjoining
woods
gave
notice
that
the
apes
were
beginning
to
suffer
from
the
poisoned
repast
prepared
for
them
as
our
dogs
could
not
remain
silent
amid
the
uproar
and
din
we
had
not
a
wink
of
sleep
until
the
morning
it
was
late
therefore
when
we
rose
and
looked
on
the
awful
spectacle
presented
by
the
multitude
of
dead
monkeys
and
baboons
thickly
strewn
under
the
trees
round
the
farm
i
shall
not
tell
you
how
many
there
were
i
can
only
say
i
wished
i
had
not
found
the
poison
and
we
made
all
haste
to
clear
away
the
dead
bodies
and
the
dangerous
food
burying
some
deep
in
the
earth
and
carrying
the
rest
to
the
shore
we
pitched
them
over
the
rocks
into
the
sea
that
day
we
traveled
on
to
the
gap
the
same
evening
that
the
boys
reached
the
rocky
pass
a
messenger
pigeon
arrived
at
rockburg
bearing
a
note
which
concluded
in
the
following
words
the
barricade
at
the
gap
is
broken
down
everything
laid
waste
as
far
as
the
where
the
hut
is
knocked
to
pieces
and
the
fields
trampled
over
by
huge
footmarks
come
to
us
father
we
are
safe
but
feel
we
are
no
match
for
this
unknown
danger
i
lost
not
an
instant
but
saddled
swift
late
as
it
was
in
order
to
ride
to
the
assistance
of
our
boys
desiring
ernest
to
prepare
the
small
cart
and
follow
me
with
his
mother
at
daybreak
bringing
everything
we
should
require
for
camping
out
for
some
days
the
bright
moonlight
favored
my
journey
and
my
arrival
at
the
gap
surprised
and
delighted
the
boys
who
did
not
expect
me
till
the
next
day
early
on
the
following
morning
i
inspected
the
footprints
and
ravages
of
the
great
unknown
the
cane
brake
had
without
doubt
been
visited
by
an
elephant
that
great
animal
alone
could
have
left
such
traces
and
committed
such
fearful
ravages
thick
posts
in
the
barricade
were
snapped
across
like
reeds
the
trees
in
the
vicinity
where
we
planned
to
build
a
cool
were
stripped
of
leaves
and
branches
to
a
great
height
but
the
worst
mischief
was
done
among
the
young
plants
which
were
all
either
devoured
or
trampled
down
and
destroyed
it
seemed
to
me
that
not
one
elephant
but
a
troop
must
have
invaded
our
grounds
the
tracks
were
very
numerous
and
the
footprints
of
various
sizes
but
to
my
satisfaction
i
saw
that
they
could
be
traced
not
only
from
the
gap
but
back
to
it
in
evidently
equal
numbers
we
did
not
therefore
suppose
that
the
mighty
animals
remained
hidden
in
the
woods
of
our
territory
but
concluded
that
after
this
freebooting
incursion
they
had
withdrawn
to
their
native
wilds
where
by
greatly
increasing
the
strength
of
our
ramparts
we
hoped
henceforth
to
oblige
them
to
remain
in
what
manner
to
effect
this
we
laid
many
plans
during
the
night
of
my
arrival
when
sitting
by
an
enormous
i
chatted
with
my
boys
and
heard
details
of
their
numerous
adventures
so
interesting
for
them
to
relate
and
for
me
to
hear
that
everyone
was
more
disposed
to
act
sentinel
than
retire
to
sleep
the
mother
and
ernest
arrived
next
day
and
she
rejoiced
to
find
all
well
making
light
of
trodden
fields
and
trampled
since
her
sons
were
sound
in
life
and
limb
a
systematic
scheme
of
defense
was
now
elaborated
and
the
erection
of
the
barricade
occupied
us
for
at
least
a
month
as
it
was
to
be
a
firm
and
durable
building
proof
against
all
invasion
as
our
little
tent
was
unsuited
to
a
long
residence
of
this
sort
i
adopted
fritz
idea
of
a
kamschatkan
dwelling
and
to
his
great
delight
forthwith
carried
it
out
instead
of
planting
four
posts
on
which
to
place
a
platform
we
chose
four
trees
of
equal
size
which
in
a
very
suitable
place
grew
exactly
in
a
square
twelve
or
fourteen
feet
apart
between
these
at
about
twenty
feet
from
the
ground
we
laid
a
flooring
of
beams
and
bamboo
smoothly
and
strongly
planked
from
this
rose
on
all
four
sides
walls
of
cane
the
frame
of
the
roof
was
covered
so
effectually
by
large
pieces
of
bark
that
no
rain
could
penetrate
the
staircase
to
this
was
simply
a
broad
plank
with
bars
nailed
across
it
for
steps
the
flooring
projected
like
a
balcony
in
front
of
the
entrance
door
and
underneath
on
the
ground
we
fitted
up
sheds
for
cattle
and
fowls
various
ornaments
in
chinese
or
japanese
style
were
added
to
the
roof
and
eaves
and
a
most
convenient
cool
and
picturesque
cottage
overhung
and
adorned
by
the
graceful
foliage
of
the
trees
was
the
result
of
our
ingenuity
i
was
pleased
to
find
that
the
various
birds
taken
by
the
boys
during
this
excursion
seemed
likely
to
thrive
they
were
the
first
inmates
of
the
new
sheds
and
even
the
black
swans
and
cranes
soon
became
tame
and
sociable
constantly
roaming
through
the
woods
the
children
often
made
new
discoveries
fritz
brought
one
day
after
an
excursion
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
stream
beyond
the
gap
a
cluster
of
bananas
and
also
of
cacao
beans
from
which
chocolate
is
made
the
banana
although
valuable
and
nourishing
food
for
the
natives
of
the
tropical
countries
where
it
grows
is
not
generally
liked
by
europeans
and
probably
this
variety
was
even
inferior
to
many
others
for
we
found
the
fruit
much
like
rotten
pears
and
almost
uneatable
the
cacao
seeds
tasted
exceedingly
bitter
and
it
seemed
wonderful
that
by
preparation
they
should
produce
anything
so
delicious
as
chocolate
my
wife
who
now
fancied
no
manufacture
beyond
my
skill
begged
for
plants
seeds
or
cuttings
to
propagate
in
her
nursery
garden
already
fancying
herself
in
the
enjoyment
of
chocolate
for
breakfast
and
i
promised
to
make
a
cacao
plantation
near
home
let
me
have
bananas
also
said
she
for
we
may
acquire
a
taste
for
that
celebrated
fruit
and
at
all
events
i
am
sure
i
can
make
it
into
an
excellent
preserve
the
day
before
our
return
to
rockburg
fritz
went
again
to
the
inland
region
beyond
the
river
to
obtain
a
large
supply
of
young
banana
plants
and
the
cacao
fruit
he
took
the
cajack
and
a
bundle
of
reeds
to
float
behind
him
as
a
raft
to
carry
the
fruit
plants
and
anything
else
he
might
wish
to
bring
back
in
the
evening
he
made
his
appearance
coming
swiftly
down
stream
his
brothers
rushed
to
meet
him
each
eager
to
see
and
help
to
land
his
cargo
ernest
and
fritz
were
quickly
running
up
the
bank
with
arms
full
of
plants
branches
and
fruits
when
fritz
handed
to
jack
a
dripping
wet
bag
which
he
had
brought
along
partly
under
water
a
curious
pattering
noise
proceeded
from
this
bag
but
they
kept
the
contents
a
secret
for
the
present
jack
running
with
it
behind
a
bush
before
peeping
in
and
i
could
just
hear
him
explain
hullo
i
say
what
monsters
they
are
it
enough
to
make
a
flesh
creep
to
look
at
them
with
that
he
hastily
shut
up
the
bag
and
put
it
away
safely
out
of
sight
in
water
securing
the
cajack
fritz
sprang
toward
us
his
handsome
face
radiant
with
pleasure
as
he
exhibited
a
beautiful
waterfowl
its
plumage
was
rich
purple
changing
on
the
back
to
dark
green
the
legs
feet
and
a
mark
above
the
bill
bright
red
this
lovely
bird
i
concluded
to
be
the
sultan
cock
described
by
buffon
and
as
it
was
gentle
we
gladly
received
it
among
our
domestic
pets
fritz
gave
a
stirring
account
of
his
exploring
trip
having
made
his
way
far
up
the
river
between
fertile
plains
and
majestic
forests
of
lofty
trees
where
the
cries
of
vast
numbers
of
birds
parrots
peacocks
guinea
fowls
and
hundreds
unknown
to
him
quite
bewildered
and
made
him
feel
giddy
it
was
in
the
buffalo
swamp
continued
he
that
i
saw
the
splendid
birds
you
call
sultan
cocks
and
i
set
my
heart
on
catching
one
alive
which
as
they
seemed
to
have
little
fear
of
my
approach
i
managed
by
means
of
a
wire
snare
farther
on
i
saw
a
grove
of
mimosa
trees
among
which
huge
dark
masses
were
moving
in
a
deliberate
way
guess
what
they
were
savages
asked
franz
timidly
black
bears
i
bet
cried
jack
your
words
suggest
to
my
mind
the
manner
and
appearance
of
elephants
said
ernest
right
you
are
professor
exclaimed
fritz
gayly
the
words
producing
quite
a
sensation
on
the
whole
attentive
family
from
fifteen
to
twenty
elephants
were
feeding
peacefully
on
the
leafy
boughs
tearing
down
branches
with
their
trunks
and
shoving
them
into
their
mouths
with
one
jerk
or
bathing
in
the
deep
waters
of
the
marsh
for
refreshment
in
the
great
heat
you
can
not
imagine
the
wild
grandeur
of
the
scene
the
river
being
very
broad
i
felt
safe
from
wild
animals
and
more
than
once
saw
splendid
jaguars
crouched
on
the
banks
their
glossy
skin
glancing
in
the
sunlight
while
considering
if
it
would
be
simply
foolhardy
to
try
a
shot
at
one
of
these
creatures
i
was
suddenly
convinced
that
discretion
is
the
better
part
of
valor
and
urging
my
canoe
into
the
center
current
made
a
rapid
retreat
down
the
river
for
just
before
me
in
the
calm
deep
water
of
a
sheltered
bay
where
i
was
quietly
floating
there
arose
a
violent
boiling
bubbling
commotion
and
for
an
instant
i
thought
a
hot
spring
was
going
to
burst
forth
instead
of
that
up
rose
the
hideous
head
and
gaping
jaws
of
a
hippopotamus
who
with
a
hoarse
terrific
snort
seemed
about
to
attack
me
i
can
tell
you
i
did
not
wait
to
see
the
rest
of
him
a
glimpse
of
his
enormous
mouth
and
its
array
of
white
gleaming
tusks
was
quite
enough
about
face
said
i
to
myself
and
shot
down
the
stream
like
an
arrow
never
pausing
till
a
bend
in
the
river
brought
me
within
sight
of
the
gap
where
i
once
more
felt
safe
and
joyfully
made
my
way
back
to
you
all
illustration
rose
the
hideous
head
and
gaping
jaws
of
a
this
narrative
was
of
thrilling
interest
to
us
proving
the
existence
of
tribes
of
the
most
formidable
animals
beyond
the
rocky
barrier
which
defended
in
so
providential
a
manner
the
small
and
fertile
territory
on
which
our
lot
was
cast
during
the
absence
of
the
adventurer
we
had
been
busily
engaged
in
making
preparations
for
our
departure
and
everything
was
packed
up
and
ready
by
the
morning
after
his
return
after
some
hesitation
i
yielded
to
his
great
wish
which
was
to
return
by
sea
in
his
cajack
round
cape
disappointment
and
so
meet
us
at
rockburg
he
was
much
interested
in
examining
the
outlines
of
the
coast
and
the
rugged
precipices
of
the
cape
these
were
tenanted
by
vast
flocks
of
sea
fowl
and
birds
of
prey
while
many
varieties
of
shrubs
and
plants
hitherto
unknown
to
us
grew
in
the
clefts
and
crevices
of
the
rocks
some
of
them
diffusing
a
strong
aromatic
odor
among
the
specimens
he
brought
i
recognized
the
caper
plant
and
with
still
greater
pleasure
a
shrub
which
was
i
felt
sure
the
of
china
it
bore
very
pretty
white
flowers
and
the
leaves
resembled
myrtle
our
land
journey
was
effected
without
accident
or
adventure
of
any
kind
jack
mounted
as
usual
on
hurry
the
ostrich
carried
the
mysterious
wet
bag
very
carefully
slung
at
his
side
and
when
near
home
started
off
at
a
prodigious
rate
in
advance
of
us
he
let
fall
the
drawbridge
and
we
saw
no
more
of
him
until
on
reaching
rockburg
he
appeared
leisurely
returning
from
the
swamp
where
apparently
he
had
gone
to
deposit
his
moist
secret
as
franz
called
it
we
were
all
glad
to
take
up
our
quarters
once
more
in
our
large
and
convenient
dwelling
and
my
first
business
was
to
provide
for
the
great
number
of
birds
we
now
had
on
our
hands
by
establishing
them
in
suitable
localities
it
being
impossible
to
maintain
them
all
in
the
poultry
yard
some
were
therefore
taken
to
the
islands
and
the
black
swans
the
heron
the
graceful
demoiselle
cranes
and
our
latest
acquisition
the
splendid
sultan
cock
soon
became
perfectly
at
home
in
the
swamp
greatly
adding
to
the
interest
of
the
neighborhood
of
safety
bay
the
old
bustards
were
the
tamest
of
all
our
feathered
pets
and
never
more
so
than
at
meal
times
they
were
unfailing
in
their
attendance
when
we
dined
or
supped
in
the
open
air
toward
evening
as
we
sat
in
the
veranda
listening
to
fritz
account
of
his
trip
round
the
cape
an
extraordinary
hollow
roaring
noise
sounded
from
the
swamp
not
unlike
the
angry
bellowing
of
a
bull
the
dogs
barked
and
the
family
rose
in
excitement
but
i
remarked
a
look
of
quiet
humor
in
fritz
eye
as
he
stood
leaning
against
one
of
the
veranda
pillars
watching
jack
who
in
some
confusion
started
off
toward
the
marsh
come
back
you
silly
boy
cried
his
mother
the
child
has
not
so
much
as
a
pistol
and
is
rushing
off
alone
to
face
he
knows
not
what
perhaps
said
i
looking
at
fritz
this
is
not
a
case
requiring
the
use
of
firearms
it
may
be
only
the
booming
of
a
bittern
which
we
hear
you
need
not
be
uneasy
mother
said
fritz
jack
knows
what
he
is
about
only
this
charming
serenade
took
him
by
surprise
and
i
fancy
he
will
have
to
exhibit
his
treasures
before
they
reach
perfection
yes
here
he
comes
lugging
his
moist
secret
along
with
him
jack
flushed
and
breathless
came
up
to
us
exclaiming
they
were
to
grow
as
big
as
rabbits
before
you
saw
them
such
a
shame
i
never
thought
they
would
kick
up
a
row
like
that
now
for
it
and
he
turned
out
the
bag
this
is
and
this
is
two
immense
frogs
rolled
clumsily
on
the
ground
and
recovering
their
feet
sat
squat
before
us
swelling
and
puffing
with
a
ludicrous
air
of
insulted
dignity
while
peals
of
laughter
greeted
them
on
all
sides
ladies
and
gentlemen
these
are
two
very
handsome
young
specimens
of
the
famous
african
bullfrog
said
jack
pretending
to
be
offended
at
the
mingled
disgust
and
amusement
occasioned
by
their
appearance
they
are
but
and
i
hoped
to
maintain
them
in
seclusion
until
they
reached
full
size
when
i
would
have
introduced
them
with
proper
éclat
but
since
their
talent
for
music
has
brought
them
precociously
into
public
notice
i
must
beg
for
your
kind
and
indulgent
patronage
and
leave
to
take
them
back
to
the
swamp
great
clapping
of
hands
followed
jack
speech
grace
and
beauty
were
examined
and
commented
on
with
much
interest
and
voted
decidedly
handsome

their
way
their
general
color
was

brown
mottled
and
spotted
with
reddish
brown
and
yellow
the
sides
green
and
black
the
under
part
yellow
mottled
with
orange
the
eyes
were
positively
beautiful
of
a
rich
chestnut
hue
covered
with
golden
white
dots
which
shone
with
a
metallic
luster
the
skin
of
the
body
was
puckered
into
longitudinal
folds
by
general
consent
they
were
remanded
to
the
swamp
shortly
after
our
return
to
rockburg
my
wife
drew
my
attention
to
the
somewhat
neglected
state
of
our
dear
old
summer
residence
at
falconhurst
begging
me
to
devote
some
time
to
its
restoration
and
embellishment
this
i
most
willingly
undertook
and
we
removed
thither
as
soon
as
the
boys
had
completed
the
arrangement
of
the
artificial
to
their
satisfaction
at
falconhurst
things
were
quickly
in
good
order
and
we
made
a
great
improvement
by
completing
the
broad
terrace
supported
on
the
arching
roots
of
the
trees
it
was
better
floored
and
rustic
pillars
and
trelliswork
sustained
a
bark
roof
which
afforded
a
pleasant
shade
after
this
was
done
i
was
compelled
to
consent
to
a
plan
long
cherished
by
fritz
who
wished
to
construct
a
watchtower
and
mount
a
gun
on
shark
island
after
great
exertion
both
mental
and
bodily
this
piece
of
military
engineering
was
completed
and
a
flagstaff
erected
on
which
the
guard
at
this
outpost
could
run
up
a
white
flag
to
signal
the
approach
of
anything
harmless
from
the
sea
while
a
red
flag
would
be
shown
on
the
least
appearance
of
danger
to
celebrate
the
completion
of
this
great
work
which
occupied
us
during
two
months
we
hoisted
the
white
flag
and
fired
a
salute
of
six
guns

said
king
david
these
words
recurred
to
me
again
and
again
as
i
reviewed
ten
years
of
which
the
story
lay
chronicled
in
the
pages
of
my
journal
year
followed
year
chapter
succeeded
chapter
steadily
imperceptibly
time
was
passing
away
the
shade
of
sadness
cast
on
my
mind
by
retrospect
of
this
kind
was
dispelled
by
thoughts
full
of
gratitude
to
god
for
the
welfare
and
happiness
of
my
beloved
family
during
so
long
a
period
i
had
cause
especially
to
rejoice
in
seeing
our
sons
advance
to
manhood
strengthened
by
early
training
for
lives
of
usefulness
and
activity
wherever
their
lot
might
fall
and
my
great
wish
is
that
young
people
who
read
this
record
of
our
lives
and
adventures
should
learn
from
it
how
admirably
suited
is
the
peaceful
industrious
and
pious
life
of
a
cheerful
united
family
to
the
formation
of
strong
pure
and
manly
character
none
take
a
better
place
in
the
great
national
family
none
are
happier
or
more
beloved
than
those
who
go
forth
from
such
homes
to
fulfill
new
duties
and
to
gather
fresh
interests
around
them
having
given
a
detailed
account
of
several
years
residence
in
new
switzerland
as
we
liked
to
call
our
dominion
it
is
needless
for
me
to
continue
what
would
exhaust
the
patience
of
the
most
by
repeating
monotonous
narratives
of
exploring
parties
and
hunting
expeditions
wearisome
descriptions
of
awkward
inventions
and
clumsy
machines
with
an
endless
record
of
discoveries
more
fit
for
the
pages
of
an
encyclopedia
than
a
book
of
family
history
yet
before
winding
up
with
the
concluding
events
i
may
mention
some
interesting
facts
illustrative
of
our
exact
position
at
the
time
these
took
place
rockburg
and
falconhurst
continued
to
be
our
winter
and
summer
headquarters
and
improvements
were
added
which
made
them
more
and
more
convenient
as
well
as
attractive
in
appearance
the
fountains
trellised
verandas
and
plantations
round
rockburg
completely
changed
the
character
of
the
residence
which
on
account
of
the
heat
and
want
of
vegetation
had
in
former
days
been
so
distasteful
to
my
wife
flowering
creepers
overhung
the
balconies
and
pillars
while
shrubs
and
trees
both
native
and
european
grew
luxuriantly
in
groves
of
our
planting
in
the
distance
shark
island
now
clothed
with
graceful
palms
guarded
the
entrance
to
safety
bay
the
battery
and
flagstaff
prominently
visible
on
its
crested
rock
the
swamp
cleared
and
drained
was
now
a
considerable
lake
with
just
marsh
and
reeds
enough
beyond
it
to
form
good
cover
for
the
waterfowl
whose
favorite
retreat
it
was
on
its
blue
waters
sailed
stately
black
swans
geese
and
richly
colored
ducks
while
out
and
in
among
the
water
plants
and
rushes
would
appear
at
intervals
glimpses
of
the
brilliant
sultan
crimson
flamingoes
soft
demoiselle
cranes
and
crested
heron
all
associating
in
harmony
and
with
no
fear
of
us
their
masters
the
giant
frogs
grace
and
beauty
delighted
jack
by
actually
attaining
in
time
to
the
size
of
small
rabbits
and
perfectly
knowing
their
very
appropriate
names
would
waddle
out
of
the
marsh
at
his
call
to
eat
a
grasshopper
or
dainty
fly
beneath
the
spreading
trees
and
through
the
aromatic
shrubberies
old
hurry
the
ostrich
was
usually
to
be
seen
marching
about
with
grave
and
dignified
pace
as
though
monarch
of
all
he
surveyed
every
variety
of
beautiful
pigeon
nested
in
the
rocks
and
dovecots
their
soft
cooing
and
glossy
plumage
making
them
favorite
household
pets
by
the
bridge
alone
could
rockburg
be
approached
for
higher
up
the
river
where
near
the
cascade
it
was
fordable
a
dense
and
impenetrable
thicket
of
orange
and
lemon
trees
indian
figs
prickly
pears
and
all
manner
of
shrubs
planted
by
us
now
formed
a
complete
barrier
the
rabbit
warren
on
shark
island
kept
us
well
supplied
with
food
as
well
as
soft
and
useful
fur
and
as
the
antelopes
did
not
thrive
on
whale
isle
they
also
were
placed
among
the
shady
groves
with
the
rabbits
and
their
own
island
devoted
to
such
work
as
tanning
and
any
other
needful
but
offensive
operations
the
farm
at
woodlands
flourished
and
our
flocks
and
herds
supplied
us
with
mutton
beef
and
veal
while
my
wife
dairy
was
almost
more
than
she
could
manage
my
boys
retained
their
old
love
for
giving
names
to
the
animals
they
had
a
beautiful
cow
called
blanche
and
a
bull
with
such
a
tremendous
voice
that
he
received
the
name
of
stentor
two
fleet
young
onagers
were
named
arrow
and
dart
and
jack
had
a
descendant
of
his
old
favorite
fangs
the
jackal
which
he
chose
to
call
coco
asserting
that
no
word
could
be
distinguished
at
a
distance
without
the
letter
o
in
it
giving
illustrations
of
his
theory
till
our
ears
were
almost
deafened
excellent
health
had
been
enjoyed
by
us
all
during
these
ten
years
though
my
wife
occasionally
suffered
from
slight
attacks
of
fever
and
the
boys
sometimes
met
with
little
accidents
they
were
all
fine
handsome
fellows
fritz
now
was
of
moderate
height
uncommonly
strong
active
muscular
and
ernest
two
years
younger
was
tall
and
slight
in
disposition
mild
calm
and
studious
his
early
faults
of
indolence
and
selfishness
were
almost
entirely
overcome
he
possessed
refined
tastes
and
great
intellectual
power
jack
at
twenty
strongly
resembled
fritz
being
about
his
height
though
more
lightly
built
and
remarkable
rather
for
active
grace
and
agility
than
for
muscular
strength
franz
a
lively
youth
of
seventeen
had
some
of
the
qualities
of
each
of
his
brothers
he
possessed
wit
and
shrewdness
but
not
the
arch
drollery
of
jack
all
were
honorable
young
men
dutiful
and
affectionate
to
their
mother
and
myself
and
warmly
attached
to
each
other
although
so
many
years
had
elapsed
in
total
seclusion
it
continued
to
be
my
strong
impression
that
we
should
one
day
be
restored
to
the
society
of
our
but
time
which
was
bringing
our
sons
to
manhood
was
also
carrying
their
parents
onward
to
old
age
and
anxious
gloomy
thoughts
relating
to
their
future
should
they
be
left
indeed
alone
sometimes
oppressed
my
heart
on
such
occasions
i
would
not
communicate
the
sense
of
depression
to
my
family
but
turning
in
prayer
to
the
almighty
father
laid
my
trouble
before
him
with
renewal
of
strength
and
hope
my
elder
sons
often
made
expeditions
of
which
we
knew
nothing
until
their
return
after
many
hours
when
any
uneasiness
i
might
have
felt
was
dissipated
by
their
joyous
appearance
and
reproof
always
died
away
on
my
lips
fritz
had
been
absent
one
whole
day
from
rockburg
and
not
until
evening
did
we
remark
that
his
cajack
was
gone
and
that
he
must
be
out
at
sea
anxious
to
see
him
return
before
nightfall
i
went
off
to
shark
island
with
ernest
and
jack
in
order
to
look
out
for
him
from
the
watch
tower
there
at
the
same
time
hoisting
our
signal
flag
and
loading
the
gun
long
we
gazed
across
the
expanse
of
ocean
glittering
in
the
level
beams
of
the
setting
sun
and
finally
discerned
a
small
black
speck
in
the
distance
which
by
the
telescope
was
proved
to
be
the
returning
wanderer
i
remarked
that
his
skiff
sailed
at
a
slower
rate
than
usual
toward
the
shore
the
cannon
was
fired
to
let
him
know
that
his
approach
was
observed
and
then
we
joyfully
hurried
back
to
receive
him
at
the
harbor
it
was
easy
to
see
as
he
drew
near
what
had
delayed
his
progress
the
cajack
towed
a
large
sack
besides
being
heavily
laden
welcome
fritz
i
cried
welcome
back
wherever
you
come
from
and
whatever
you
bring
you
seem
to
have
quite
a
cargo
there
yes
and
my
trip
has
led
to
discoveries
as
well
as
booty
answered
he
interesting
discoveries
which
will
tempt
us
again
in
the
same
direction
come
boys
let
carry
up
the
things
and
while
i
rest
i
will
relate
my
adventures
as
soon
as
possible
all
assembled
round
him
i
think
my
absence
without
leave
deserves
reproach
instead
of
this
warm
reception
father
and
i
must
apologize
for
it
he
began
but
ever
since
i
possessed
the
cajack
it
has
been
my
ambition
to
make
a
voyage
of
discovery
along
the
coast
which
we
have
never
explored
beyond
the
point
at
which
i
killed
the
walrus
in
order
to
be
ready
to
start
without
delay
when
a
convenient
opportunity
offered
i
made
preparations
beforehand
such
as
provisioning
my
skiff
fixing
the
compass
in
front
of
my
seat
arranging
conveniently
rifle
harpoon
ax
and
fishing
net
i
also
resolved
to
take
with
me
pounce
my
eagle
and
this
i
always
will
do
in
future
this
morning
dawned
magnificently
the
calm
sea
the
gentle
breeze
all
drew
me
irresistibly
to
the
fulfillment
of
my
purpose
i
left
the
harbor
unperceived
the
current
quickly
bore
me
out
to
sea
and
i
rounded
the
point
to
the
left
passing
just
over
the
spot
where
beneath
the
waves
lie
the
guns
cannon
balls
ironwork
and
all
that
was
indestructible
about
our
good
old
wreck
and
would
you
believe
it
through
the
glassy
clear
water
undisturbed
by
a
ripple
i
actually
saw
many
such
things
strewn
on
the
flat
rocky
bottom
pursuing
my
way
i
passed
among
rugged
cliffs
and
rocks
which
jutted
out
from
the
shore
or
rose
in
rugged
masses
from
the
water
myriads
of
sea
fowl
inhabited
the
most
inaccessible
of
these
while
on
the
lower
ridges
seals
sea
bears
and
walruses
were
to
be
seen
some
basking
lazily
in
the
sun
some
plunging
into
the
water
or
emerging
awkwardly
from
it
hoisting
their
unwieldy
bodies
up
the
rocks
by
means
of
their
tusks
i
must
confess
to
feeling
anything
but
comfortable
while
going
through
the
places
held
in
possession
by
these
monsters
of
the
deep
and
used
every
effort
to
pass
quickly
and
unnoticed
yet
it
was
more
than
an
hour
and
a
half
before
i
got
clear
of
the
rocks
cliffs
and
shoals
to
which
they
resorted
and
near
a
high
and
precipitous
cape
running
far
out
to
sea
right
opposite
to
me
in
the
side
of
this
rocky
wall
was
a
magnificent
archway
forming
as
it
first
appeared
to
me
a
lofty
entrance
to
an
immense
vaulted
cavern
i
passed
beneath
this
noble
portal
and
examined
the
interior
it
was
tenanted
by
numbers
of
a
small
species
of
swallow
scarcely
larger
than
a
wren
and
the
walls
were
covered
by
thousands
of
their
nests
they
were
rudely
built
and
their
peculiarity
was
that
each
rested
on
a
kind
of
platform
something
like
a
spoon
without
the
handle
i
detached
a
number
and
found
that
they
had
a
curious
appearance
seemingly
made
of
something
fibrous
and
gelatinous
and
more
like
a
set
of
sponges
corals
or
fungi
than
nests
of
birds
i
have
brought
them
home
in
my
fishing
net
if
we
had
commercial
dealings
with
the
chinese
said
i
your
discovery
would
be
of
value
these
are
doubtless
edible
bird
nests
the
bird
is
called
the
esculent
swallow
and
the
trade
in
this
strange
article
of
diet
is
a
very
large
one
the
nests
are
of
different
value
but
those
which
are
quite
new
and
nearly
white
are
held
in
such
esteem
that
they
are
worth
their
weight
in
silver
there
are
tremendous
caverns
in
java
and
other
places
where
at
great
risk
these
nests
are
procured
the
annual
weight
obtained
being
upward
of
fifty
thousand
pounds
and
the
value
more
than
when
placed
in
water
and
well
soaked
they
soften
and
swell
and
are
made
into
soup
of
very
strengthening
and
restorative
quality
i
think
you
might
try
your
hand
on
these
mother
just
for
sake
i
ca
say
i
fancy
the
look
of
the
queer
things
said
she
but
i
do
mind
trying
if
they
will
turn
to
jelly
though
boiling
nests
is
cookery
quite
out
of
my
line
oh
do
mother
let
us
taste
birds
nests
as
soon
as
you
can
though
the
idea
makes
me
fancy
my
mouth
full
of
feathers
laughed
jack
it
is
really
a
most
curious
formation
said
fritz
from
whence
are
the
swallows
supposed
to
get
this
kind
of
gelatine
it
has
never
been
exactly
ascertained
i
replied
whether
the
birds
discover
or
produce
this
curious
substance
but
whatever
may
be
its
basis
it
is
clear
that
a
very
large
portion
of
it
is
furnished
by
certain
glands
which
pour
out
a
viscid
secretion
after
laying
in
my
store
of
nests
continued
fritz
i
pursued
my
way
through
this
vaulted
cave
or
corridor
which
presently
turning
opened
into
a
very
lonely
bay
so
calm
and
that
although
of
considerable
size
i
concluded
at
once
it
must
be
nearly
land
locked
its
shores
beyond
the
rocky
boundary
through
which
i
penetrated
extended
in
a
fertile
plain
toward
what
seemed
the
mouth
of
a
river
beyond
which
lay
rough
and
probably
marshy
ground
and
a
dense
forest
of
cedars
which
closed
the
view
the
water
beneath
me
was
clear
as
crystal
and
gazing
into
its
depths
and
shallows
i
perceived
beds
of
like
large
oysters
attached
to
the
rocks
and
to
each
other
by
tufts
of
hairy
filaments
these
are
oysters
thought
i
must
be
better
worth
eating
as
far
as
size
goes
than
our
little
friends
in
safety
bay
and
thereupon
i
hooked
up
several
clusters
with
my
and
landing
soon
after
on
the
beach
i
flung
them
on
the
sand
resolving
to
fetch
another
load
and
then
tow
them
after
me
in
the
the
hot
sun
disagreed
with
their
constitution
i
suppose
for
when
i
came
back
the
shells
were
all
gaping
wide
open
so
i
began
to
examine
them
thinking
that
after
all
they
were
probably
much
less
delicate
than
the
small
oysters
we
have
learnt
to
like
so
much
somehow
when
a
thing
is
to
be
one
generally
needs
a
knife
the
blade
met
with
resistance
here
and
there
in
the
creature
body
and
still
closer
produced
from
it
several
pearly
balls
like
peas
of
different
sizes
do
you
think
they
can
be
pearls
i
have
a
number
here
in
a
box
oh
show
them
to
us
fritz
cried
the
boys
what
pretty
shining
things
and
how
delicately
rounded
and
how
softly
they
gleam
you
have
discovered
treasure
indeed
i
exclaimed
why
these
are
most
beautiful
pearls
valueless
certainly
under
present
circumstances
but
they
may
prove
a
source
of
wealth
should
we
ever
again
come
into
contact
with
the
civilized
world
we
must
visit
your
beds
at
the
earliest
opportunity
after
resting
for
some
time
and
refreshing
myself
with
food
pursued
fritz
i
resumed
my
survey
of
the
coast
my
progress
somewhat
impeded
by
the
bag
of
which
i
drew
after
me
but
i
proceeded
without
accident
past
the
mouth
of
the
stream
to
the
further
side
of
the
bay
which
was
there
inclosed
by
a
point
corresponding
to
that
through
which
i
had
entered
and
between
these
headlands
i
found
a
line
of
reefs
and
with
but
a
single
channel
leading
out
to
the
open
sea
from
which
therefore
pearl
bay
as
i
named
it
lies
completely
sheltered
the
tide
was
setting
strongly
in
shore
so
that
i
could
not
then
attempt
a
passage
through
it
but
examined
the
crags
of
the
headland
thinking
i
might
perchance
discover
a
second
vaulted
archway
i
saw
nothing
remarkable
however
but
thousands
of
sea
fowl
of
every
sort
and
kind
from
the
gull
and
sea
swallow
to
the
mighty
albatross
my
approach
was
evidently
regarded
as
an
invasion
and
trespass
for
they
regularly
beset
me
screaming
and
wheeling
over
my
head
till
out
of
all
patience
i
stood
up
and
hit
furiously
about
me
with
the
when
rather
to
my
surprise
one
blow
struck
an
albatross
with
such
force
that
he
fell
stunned
into
the
water
i
now
once
more
attempted
to
cross
the
reef
by
the
narrow
channel
and
happily
succeeding
found
myself
in
the
open
sea
and
speeding
homeward
joyfully
saw
our
flag
flying
and
heard
the
welcome
salute
you
fired
here
ended
the
narrative
but
next
morning
fritz
drew
me
aside
and
confided
to
me
a
most
remarkable
sequel
in
these
words
there
was
something
very
extraordinary
about
that
albatross
father
i
allowed
you
to
suppose
that
i
left
it
as
it
fell
but
in
reality
i
raised
it
to
the
deck
of
the
canoe
and
then
perceived
a
piece
of
rag
wound
round
one
of
its
legs
this
i
removed
and
to
my
utter
astonishment
saw
english
words
written
on
it
which
i
plainly
made
out
to
be
an
unfortunate
englishwoman
from
the
smoking
rock
this
little
sentence
sent
a
thrill
through
every
nerve
my
brain
seemed
to
whirl
i
doubted
the
evidence
of
my
senses
this
reality
or
delusion
thought
i
it
be
true
that
a
breathes
with
us
the
air
of
this
lonely
region
i
felt
stupefied
for
some
minutes
the
bird
began
to
show
signs
of
life
which
recalled
me
to
myself
and
quickly
deciding
what
must
be
done
i
tore
a
strip
from
my
handkerchief
on
which
i
traced
the
words
not
despair
help
is
near
this
i
carefully
bound
round
one
leg
replacing
the
rag
on
the
other
and
then
applied
myself
to
the
complete
restoration
of
the
bird
it
gradually
revived
and
after
drinking
a
little
surprised
me
by
suddenly
rising
on
the
wing
faltering
a
moment
in
its
flight
and
then
rapidly
disappearing
from
my
view
in
a
westerly
direction
now
father
one
thought
occupies
me
continually
will
my
note
ever
reach
this
englishwoman
shall
i
be
able
to
find
and
to
save
her
i
listened
to
this
account
with
feelings
of
the
liveliest
interest
and
astonishment
my
dear
son
said
i
you
have
done
wisely
in
confiding
to
me
alone
your
most
exciting
discovery
unless
we
know
more
we
must
not
unsettle
the
others
by
speaking
of
it
for
it
appears
to
me
quite
possible
that
these
words
were
penned
long
ago
on
some
distant
shore
where
by
this
time
the
unhappy
stranger
may
have
perished
miserably
by
the
rock
must
be
meant
a
volcano
there
are
none
here
fritz
was
not
disposed
to
look
at
the
case
from
this
gloomy
point
of
view
did
not
think
the
rag
so
very
old
believed
smoke
might
rise
from
a
rock
which
was
not
volcanic
and
evidently
cherished
the
hope
that
he
might
be
able
to
respond
effectually
to
this
touching
appeal
i
was
in
reality
as
anxious
as
himself
on
the
subject
but
judged
it
prudent
to
abate
rather
than
excite
hopes
of
success
which
might
be
doomed
to
bitter
disappointment
after
earnest
consultation
on
the
subject
we
decided
that
fritz
should
go
in
search
of
the
writer
of
the
message
but
not
until
he
had
so
altered
the
canoe
as
to
fit
it
for
carrying
two
persons
as
well
as
provisions
sufficient
to
admit
of
his
absence
for
a
considerable
time
impatient
as
he
was
he
could
not
but
see
the
wisdom
of
this
delay
we
returned
to
the
house
and
saw
the
boys
busily
opening
the
oysters
which
they
had
had
no
time
to
do
the
previous
night
and
greatly
excited
as
ever
and
anon
a
pearl
was
found
may
we
not
establish
a
pearl
fishery
at
once
father
shouted
they
we
might
build
a
hut
on
the
shore
of
the
bay
and
set
about
it
regularly
an
excursion
to
pearl
bay
was
now
the
event
to
which
all
thoughts
turned
and
for
which
preparations
on
a
grand
scale
were
made
it
was
to
form
as
it
were
the
basis
of
the
more
important
voyage
fritz
had
in
view
and
to
which
unsuspected
by
the
rest
he
could
devote
all
his
attention
i
took
an
opportunity
one
day
when
all
were
present
to
remark
in
a
serious
tone
i
have
been
considering
dear
wife
that
our
eldest
son
is
now
of
an
age
to
be
dependent
on
himself
i
shall
therefore
henceforth
leave
him
at
liberty
to
act
in
all
respects
according
to
his
own
judgment
and
especially
in
the
matter
of
voyages
or
excursions
he
must
not
be
hampered
by
the
fear
of
alarming
us
should
he
choose
to
remain
absent
longer
than
we
expect
i
have
such
entire
confidence
in
his
prudence
and
at
the
same
time
in
his
affection
for
us
that
i
am
certain
he
will
never
needlessly
cause
us
anxiety
fritz
looked
gratefully
toward
me
as
i
spoke
and
his
mother
ratified
my
words
embracing
him
affectionately
and
saying
with
emotion
god
bless
and
preserve
thee
my
boy
it
took
some
time
to
make
several
raking
or
scraping
machines
which
i
invented
for
the
purpose
of
detaching
and
lifting
the
oysters
from
their
native
rocks
but
that
gave
fritz
leisure
to
change
the
fittings
of
his
canoe
so
as
to
have
a
spare
seat
in
it
his
brothers
naturally
concluded
he
meant
to
take
one
of
them
as
shipmate
on
board
and
he
allowed
the
mistake
to
continue
they
occupied
themselves
in
making
various
articles
they
expected
to
be
of
use
and
bore
the
delay
with
tolerable
patience
at
last
came
the
day
when
taking
leave
of
the
mother
and
franz
we
went
on
board
the
yacht
accompanied
by
some
of
the
dogs
while
jack
proudly
occupying
the
new
seat
beside
fritz
in
the
canoe
shared
with
him
the
honor
of
leading
the
way
in
the
character
of
pilots
we
passed
safely
through
the
rocks
and
shoals
near
walrus
island
into
an
expanse
of
calm
water
sheltered
by
jutting
cliffs
where
the
sea
glanced
like
a
mirror
and
for
the
first
time
we
observed
the
shells
of
the
sailing
lightly
over
the
dazzling
surface
it
was
impossible
to
see
these
lovely
seafarers
without
wishing
to
obtain
specimens
and
the
canoe
accordingly
gave
chase
presently
securing
half
a
dozen
which
were
handed
to
us
in
the
yacht
to
be
carefully
preserved
for
the
museum
and
the
place
was
ever
after
called
nautilus
creek
further
on
we
rounded
a
short
promontory
flat
with
an
abrupt
rock
at
the
extremity
to
which
we
gave
the
name
of
cape
and
then
at
some
distance
appeared
the
grand
cliffs
of
a
headland
running
far
out
to
sea
this
i
supposed
we
should
have
to
weather
but
my
pilots
made
no
change
in
our
course
and
following
the
canoe
we
soon
came
in
sight
of
the
majestic
archway
which
offered
us
a
short
passage
to
pearl
bay
the
wonderfully
architectural
appearance
of
the
pillars
arches
and
pinnacles
surrounding
and
surmounting
this
noble
entrance
struck
me
with
admiration
resembling
parts
of
a
fine
gothic
cathedral
and
inducing
me
to
propose
for
it
the
name
cape
minster
a
perfect
cloud
of
little
swallows
darted
from
the
cavernous
entrance
on
our
approach
divided
into
flocks
soared
wheeled
flew
right
and
left
and
finally
returned
in
a
body
as
swiftly
as
they
came
to
the
sides
of
the
long
dark
tunnel
which
were
festooned
with
their
nests
we
detached
a
number
of
these
as
we
passed
taking
care
to
leave
those
containing
eggs
of
young
the
best
were
at
a
considerable
height
but
the
broken
and
shelving
rocks
afforded
in
some
places
footing
for
such
daring
and
active
climbers
as
fritz
and
jack
and
they
quickly
obtained
as
many
as
we
could
possibly
require
our
progress
was
much
assisted
by
the
tide
which
like
a
current
bore
us
onward
along
the
nave
of
this
natural
cathedral
aisles
transepts
screens
and
appearing
between
the
columns
and
arches
which
in
the
dim
religious
light
were
revealed
to
our
wondering
eyes
on
emerging
into
the
dazzling
sunshine
we
found
ourselves
floating
in
the
calm
expanse
of
pearl
bay
but
it
was
some
minutes
before
we
could
look
around
on
the
bright
and
lovely
scene
fritz
had
not
its
beauty
and
the
romantic
islets
which
studded
its
waters
seemed
to
give
the
effect
of
a
pleasant
smile
to
features
already
perfect
we
cruised
about
for
some
time
surveying
the
coast
with
its
fertile
meadows
shady
groves
gently
swelling
hills
and
murmuring
brooks
seeking
a
convenient
landing
place
in
the
vicinity
of
the
shallows
where
lay
the
this
we
found
close
to
a
sparkling
streamlet
and
as
the
day
was
fast
declining
we
made
speedy
arrangements
for
burning
a
after
which
we
partook
of
a
hasty
supper
and
leaving
the
dogs
with
coco
the
jackal
to
sleep
on
shore
we
returned
on
board
the
yacht
for
the
night
anchoring
within
gunshot
of
the
land
the
coast
being
quite
strange
to
us
i
knew
not
what
wild
beasts
might
frequent
it
but
though
i
did
not
fear
that
any
would
approach
us
by
swimming
yet
i
was
glad
to
have
with
us
our
lively
little
ape
mercury
the
successor
of
our
old
favorite
knips
long
since
gathered
to
his
fathers
for
he
occupied
at
night
a
cozy
berth
on
deck
and
was
certain
to
give
vociferous
notice
should
anything
alarming
occur
fritz
moored
the
cajack
alongside
and
came
on
board
the
night
passed
in
peace
although
for
a
time
we
were
disturbed
by
the
yelping
of
jackals
with
whom
coco
persisted
in
keeping
up
a
noisy
conversation
we
awoke
at
daybreak
and
after
breakfasting
la
we
repaired
in
haste
with
nets
scrapers
and
all
other
requisites
to
the
where
we
worked
with
such
diligence
and
success
that
in
the
course
of
two
days
we
had
an
immense
pile
of
shells
built
up
like
a
stack
on
the
beach
and
left
to
decay
i
collected
a
quantity
of
seaweed
to
spread
over
them
which
was
afterward
burnt
to
make
alkali
when
we
returned
to
secure
our
harvest
of
pearls
every
evening
we
went
out
shooting
in
the
neighborhood
and
kept
ourselves
supplied
with
game
of
one
sort
or
another
the
last
day
of
our
fishery
we
started
earlier
intending
to
make
a
longer
excursion
into
the
woods
ernest
set
off
first
with
floss
jack
and
coco
strolling
after
them
fritz
and
i
were
still
employed
in
taking
on
board
the
last
load
of
our
tools
when
we
suddenly
heard
a
shot
a
loud
cry
of
pain
or
fear
and
then
another
shot
at
the
first
alarm
the
other
two
dogs
rushed
away
from
us
toward
the
spot
and
fritz
who
had
just
called
pounce
from
his
perch
to
accompany
us
in
the
ramble
let
him
fly
and
seizing
his
rifle
darted
off
in
the
same
direction
before
i
could
reach
the
scene
of
action
more
shots
were
heard
and
then
a
shout
of
victory
after
which
appeared
through
the
stems
of
the
trees
the
disconsolate
figure
of
jack
hobbling
along
like
a
cripple
supported
on
each
side
by
his
brothers
when
they
came
near
me
they
stopped
and
poor
jack
moaning
and
groaning
began
to
feel
himself
all
over
as
if
to
search
for
broken
bones
crying
out
i
pounded
like
a
on
examination
i
found
some
severe
bruises
who
or
what
has
been
pommeling
the
boy
i
exclaimed
one
would
think
he
had
been
beaten
it
was
a
huge
wild
boar
said
ernest
with
fierce
eyes
monstrous
tusks
and
a
snout
as
broad
as
my
hand
we
took
jack
down
to
the
yacht
bathed
his
bruises
gave
him
a
cooling
drink
and
he
soon
fell
fast
asleep
in
his
berth
where
i
left
him
and
returned
to
the
shore
now
ernest
said
i
enlighten
me
on
the
subject
of
this
adventure
what
you
and
the
boar
did
is
quite
a
mystery
to
me
floss
and
i
were
going
quietly
along
replied
he
when
suddenly
there
was
a
rustling
and
snorting
close
by
and
a
great
boar
broke
through
the
bushes
making
for
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
floss
gave
chase
directly
and
the
boar
turned
to
bay
then
up
came
jack
with
coco
and
the
gallant
little
jackal
attacked
the
monster
in
the
rear
in
another
moment
however
he
was
sent
sprawling
upon
his
back
and
this
so
provoked
his
master
that
he
fired
a
hasty
shot
the
brute
notice
and
fury
at
once
turned
upon
jack
who
prudently
took
to
his
heels
when
i
attempted
to
check
the
career
of
the
boar
by
a
shot
which
however
only
slightly
wounded
it
jack
stumbled
and
fell
over
the
root
of
a
tree
just
as
the
animal
came
up
with
him
murder
shouted
he
and
if
the
other
dogs
had
not
then
arrived
and
all
together
tackled
the
boar
i
fear
it
would
have
been
a
case
of
murder
indeed
as
it
was
the
poor
fellow
got
mauled
and
trampled
upon
dreadfully
as
i
was
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
fire
without
any
risk
of
hitting
jack
pounce
rushed
through
the
air
and
darted
upon
the
beast
and
fritz
came
up
quickly
and
shot
it
dead
with
a
pistol
while
we
were
helping
jack
along
and
passing
a
place
where
the
boar
had
been
grubbing
i
noticed
some
such
curious
knotty
roots
or
tubercles
that
i
brought
away
specimens
are
they
worth
anything
do
you
think
they
have
a
strong
smell
if
i
may
trust
my
nose
said
i
you
have
brought
something
by
no
means
to
be
despised
yes
i
continued
putting
them
to
my
lips
these
are
very
fine
truffles
taste
them
fritz
indeed
they
are
excellent
said
he
very
different
from
the
tough
leathery
things
i
remember
in
europe
these
are
tender
and
well
flavored
because
they
are
fresh
said
i
you
have
before
tasted
those
only
which
have
been
brought
from
a
distance
they
are
found
in
different
parts
of
europe
buried
at
a
depth
of
ten
or
twelve
inches
in
the
soil
of
oak
or
beech
woods
a
small
dog
is
employed
to
hunt
for
them
who
perceives
their
musky
odor
in
a
singularly
acute
way
and
at
once
scratches
at
the
spot
where
they
lie
have
the
truffles
no
leaves
or
stalks
inquired
fritz
by
which
they
might
be
found
without
the
help
of
the
dog
they
have
nothing
of
the
sort
i
replied
they
are
discovered
simply
by
scent
and
are
considered
to
belong
to
the
tribe
of
fungi
by
this
time
it
was
late
we
took
supper
made
up
the
and
withdrew
to
our
yacht
where
we
slept
peacefully
early
next
morning
we
proceeded
to
visit
the
field
of
battle
the
wild
boar
which
i
had
not
before
seen
proved
to
be
much
larger
and
more
formidable
in
appearance
than
i
had
imagined
and
jack
escape
seemed
to
me
perfectly
marvelous
the
boys
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
that
we
were
to
cut
out
hams
and
flitches
and
we
therefore
did
so
though
i
warned
them
that
they
need
not
expect
much
pleasure
in
eating
bacon
from
a
tough
old
african
boar
like
this
we
conveyed
the
mighty
hams
to
the
beach
each
on
a
sledge
of
plaited
boughs
and
twigs
and
drawn
by
one
of
the
dogs
the
monstrous
head
traveled
in
the
same
way
and
we
collected
a
large
number
of
truffles
before
quitting
the
forest
as
soon
as
the
dogs
were
released
they
rushed
back
to
the
scene
of
operations
in
the
wood
comprehending
that
they
were
now
free
to
feast
on
what
remained
there
there
was
so
much
to
be
done
in
consequence
of
this
affair
that
fritz
who
had
hoped
to
set
out
on
his
solitary
expedition
that
day
deferred
it
until
the
next
and
was
therefore
fortunately
with
us
when
late
in
the
evening
we
desisted
from
our
labors
and
having
supped
were
preparing
to
retire
to
rest
all
at
once
a
deep
fearful
sound
echoed
through
the
neighboring
woods
it
made
our
blood
curdle
in
our
veins
we
listened
with
straining
ears
hoping
it
would
not
be
repeated
with
a
shudder
we
heard
the
dread
voice
roar
again
yet
nearer
to
us
and
an
answer
peal
from
the
distance
we
must
find
out
who
are
the
performers
in
this
concert
exclaimed
fritz
springing
to
his
feet
and
snatching
up
his
rifle
make
the
fire
blaze
get
on
board
the
yacht
and
have
all
the
guns
in
readiness
i
am
off
to
reconnoiter
in
the
canoe
we
mechanically
obeyed
his
rapid
orders
while
the
bold
youth
disappeared
in
the
darkness
and
after
heaping
fuel
on
the
fire
we
went
on
board
and
armed
ourselves
with
cutlasses
besides
loading
all
the
guns
waiting
in
readiness
either
to
land
again
or
to
quit
the
coast
we
presently
saw
the
whole
pack
of
our
dogs
as
well
as
coco
the
jackal
and
the
little
ape
mercury
who
had
been
tempted
by
the
truffles
to
stay
with
them
in
the
woods
come
galloping
at
full
speed
up
to
the
fire
mercury
was
evidently
excessively
discomposed
at
finding
us
gone
he
gnashed
his
teeth
and
chattered
as
though
in
fear
looking
hopelessly
at
the
water
through
which
he
could
not
venture
the
dogs
planted
themselves
by
the
fire
gazing
fixedly
landward
with
ears
erect
and
occasionally
uttering
a
barking
challenge
or
a
suppressed
howl
meantime
the
horrid
roarings
approached
nearer
and
i
concluded
that
a
couple
of
leopards
or
panthers
had
been
attracted
by
the
scent
of
the
boar
carcass
but
not
long
after
i
had
expressed
this
opinion
we
beheld
a
large
powerful
animal
spring
from
the
underwood
and
with
a
bound
and
muttered
roar
approach
the
fire
in
a
moment
i
recognized
the
unmistakable
outlines
of
the
form
of
a
lion
though
in
size
he
far
surpassed
any
i
had
ever
seen
exhibited
in
europe
the
dogs
slunk
behind
the
fire
and
the
lion
seated
himself
almost
like
a
cat
on
his
hind
legs
glaring
alternately
at
them
and
at
the
great
boar
hams
which
hung
near
with
doubtless
a
mixed
feeling
of
irritation
and
appetite
which
was
testified
by
the
restless
movements
of
his
tail
he
then
arose
and
commenced
walking
up
and
down
with
slow
and
measured
pace
occasionally
uttering
short
angry
roars
quite
unlike
the
prolonged
full
tones
we
had
heard
at
first
at
times
he
went
to
drink
at
the
brook
always
returning
with
such
haste
that
i
fully
expected
to
see
him
spring
gradually
his
manner
became
more
and
more
threatening
he
turned
toward
us
crouched
and
with
his
body
at
full
stretch
waved
his
tail
and
glared
so
furiously
that
i
was
in
doubt
whether
to
fire
or
retreat
when
through
the
darkness
rang
the
sharp
crack
of
a
rifle
that
is
fritz
exclaimed
everyone
while
with
a
fearful
roar
the
lion
sprang
to
his
feet
stood
stock
still
tottered
sank
on
his
knees
rolled
over
and
lay
motionless
on
the
sand
we
are
saved
i
cried
that
was
a
masterly
shot
the
lion
is
struck
to
the
heart
he
will
never
stir
again
stay
on
board
boys
i
must
join
my
brave
fritz
in
a
few
moments
i
landed
the
dogs
met
me
with
evident
tokens
of
pleasure
but
kept
whining
uneasily
and
looking
toward
the
deep
darkness
of
the
woods
whence
the
lion
had
come
this
behavior
made
me
cautious
and
seeing
nothing
of
fritz
i
lingered
by
the
boat
when
suddenly
a
lioness
bounded
from
the
shadow
of
the
trees
into
the
light
diffused
by
the
fire
at
sight
of
the
blazing
fagots
she
paused
as
though
startled
passed
with
uncertain
step
round
the
outskirts
of
the
illuminated
circle
and
uttered
roarings
which
were
evidently
calls
to
her
mate
whose
dead
body
she
presently
discovered
finding
him
motionless
her
manner
betokened
the
greatest
concern
she
touched
him
with
her
forepaws
smelt
round
him
and
licked
his
bleeding
wounds
then
raising
her
head
she
gnashed
her
teeth
and
gave
forth
the
most
lamentable
and
dreadful
sound
i
ever
heard
a
mingled
roar
and
howl
which
was
like
the
expression
of
grief
rage
and
a
vow
to
be
revenged
all
in
one
crack
another
shot
the
creature
right
forepaw
was
lamed
and
the
dogs
seeing
me
raise
my
gun
suddenly
gathered
courage
and
ran
forward
just
as
i
fired
my
shot
also
wounded
the
lioness
but
not
mortally
and
the
most
terrific
combat
ensued
it
was
impossible
to
fire
again
for
fear
of
wounding
the
dogs
the
scene
was
fearful
beyond
description
black
night
surrounded
us
the
fitful
blaze
of
the
fire
shed
a
strange
unnatural
light
on
the
prostrate
body
of
the
huge
dead
lion
and
on
the
wounded
lioness
who
fought
desperately
against
the
attack
of
the
four
gallant
dogs
while
the
cries
roars
and
groans
of
anguish
and
fury
uttered
by
all
the
animals
were
enough
to
try
the
stoutest
nerves
old
juno
staunch
to
the
last
was
foremost
in
the
fray
after
a
time
i
saw
her
change
her
plan
of
attack
and
spring
at
the
throat
of
the
lioness
who
in
an
instant
raised
her
left
paw
and
at
one
blow
the
cruel
claws
had
laid
open
the
body
of
the
dog
and
destroyed
the
life
of
the
true
and
faithful
companion
of
so
many
years
just
then
fritz
appeared
the
lioness
was
much
weakened
and
we
ventured
to
go
near
enough
to
fire
with
safety
to
ourselves
and
finally
i
dispatched
her
by
plunging
a
deep
in
her
breast
ernest
and
jack
were
summoned
from
the
yacht
to
witness
the
completed
victory
and
i
regretted
having
left
them
on
board
when
i
saw
how
greatly
the
noise
and
tumult
had
alarmed
them
unable
as
they
were
to
ascertain
what
was
going
on
they
hastened
toward
us
in
great
agitation
and
their
joy
on
seeing
us
safe
was
only
equaled
by
the
grief
they
felt
on
learning
the
death
of
juno
the
night
was
now
far
advanced
the
fire
burnt
low
but
we
piled
on
more
wood
and
by
the
renewed
light
drew
poor
juno
from
between
the
paws
of
the
lioness
and
by
the
brookside
washed
and
bound
up
the
torn
body
wrapping
it
carefully
in
canvas
and
carrying
it
with
us
on
board
the
yacht
that
it
might
be
buried
at
rockburg
whither
on
the
following
day
it
was
our
purpose
to
return
wearied
and
sorrowful
but
full
of
thankfulness
for
our
personal
safety
we
at
length
lay
down
to
sleep
having
brought
all
the
dogs
on
board
next
morning
before
quitting
pearl
bay
we
once
more
landed
that
we
might
possess
ourselves
of
the
magnificent
skins
of
the
lion
and
lioness
whose
visit
fatal
to
themselves
had
caused
such
a
commotion
during
the
night
in
about
a
couple
of
hours
we
returned
to
the
yacht
leaving
the
flayed
carcasses
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
birds
of
prey
sure
to
be
attracted
to
them
homeward
bound
sang
out
the
boys
as
they
cheerily
weighed
anchor
and
prepared
to
stand
out
to
sea
i
could
see
though
he
did
not
complain
that
poor
jack
had
not
recovered
from
the
boar
rough
treatment
and
moved
very
stiffly
you
must
pilot
us
through
the
channel
in
the
reef
this
time
fritz
said
i
adding
in
a
lower
tone
and
then
is
it
to
be
my
son
yes
dear
father
au
revoir
returned
he
brightly
with
a
glance
full
of
meaning
while
he
threw
into
his
canoe
a
cushion
and
a
fur
cloak
thanks
fritz
but
i
going
to
honor
them
with
the
care
of
my
battered
bones
in
the
yacht
here
you
are
awfully
considerate
though
old
fellow
remarked
jack
not
for
a
moment
doubting
that
his
brother
expected
him
to
return
as
he
came
beside
him
in
the
cajack
fritz
laughed
and
commended
his
decision
then
springing
into
his
skiff
he
led
the
way
toward
the
open
sea
we
followed
carefully
and
soon
passed
the
reef
after
which
the
boys
were
very
busy
with
the
sails
putting
the
vessel
on
the
homeward
course
when
waving
his
hand
to
me
fritz
turned
in
the
opposite
direction
and
quickly
vanished
behind
the
point
which
i
afterward
named
cape
farewell
when
missed
by
his
brothers
i
said
he
had
a
fancy
to
explore
more
of
the
coast
and
if
he
found
it
interesting
he
might
instead
of
only
a
few
hours
remain
absent
for
two
or
three
days
toward
evening
we
sailed
into
safety
bay
chapter
xvii
how
fritz
found
the
fair
stranger
the
mother
and
franz
though
somewhat
startled
by
the
unexpected
absence
of
fritz
were
delighted
to
see
us
return
safely
and
listened
with
eager
interest
to
our
adventures
my
wife
shuddered
and
scarcely
suppressed
an
involuntary
scream
as
she
heard
of
our
desperate
encounter
with
the
lion
and
his
mate
jack
danger
and
providential
escape
too
made
her
tremble
and
so
pale
did
he
still
look
that
she
could
scarcely
believe
he
was
uninjured
tears
came
into
franz
eyes
when
he
heard
of
the
sad
death
of
poor
old
juno
and
he
inquired
most
tenderly
whether
her
remains
had
been
brought
back
that
they
might
be
interred
near
the
house
which
had
been
her
home
for
so
many
years
next
day
he
saw
her
buried
carefully
and
ernest
at
his
request
produced
an
epitaph
which
was
inscribed
upon
a
slab
of
stone
above
her
grave
juno
a
servant
true
lies
here
a
faithful
friend
a
dog
to
all
most
dear
who
met
her
end
fighting
right
bravely
in
her
master
cause
the
flesh
of
the
wild
boar
and
the
truffles
were
handed
over
to
the
mother
who
received
them
with
delight
promising
us
therefrom
many
a
savory
dish
she
would
fain
have
had
the
boar
head
too
but
my
word
was
pledged
to
ernest
that
it
should
adorn
his
museum
and
though
my
lips
watered
to
taste
it
baked
in
hottentot
fashion
i
would
not
break
my
promise
this
splendid
head
therefore
together
with
the
lions
skins
we
carried
to
the
tannery
on
whale
island
where
they
were
cleaned
and
dressed
five
days
passed
but
fritz
still
remained
absent
i
could
not
conceal
my
anxiety
and
at
length
determined
to
follow
him
all
were
delighted
at
the
proposal
and
even
the
mother
when
she
heard
that
we
were
to
sail
in
the
pinnace
agreed
to
accompany
us
the
boat
was
stored
and
on
a
bright
morning
with
a
favorable
breeze
we
five
with
the
dogs
stepped
aboard
and
ran
for
cape
minster
our
beautiful
little
yacht
bounded
over
the
water
gayly
and
the
bright
sunshine
and
delicious
sea
breeze
put
us
all
in
the
highest
spirits
the
entrance
of
the
archway
was
in
sight
and
thither
i
was
directing
the
boat
course
suddenly
right
ahead
i
saw
a
dark
and
shadowy
mass
just
below
the
surface
of
the
water
a
sunken
rock
i
thought
to
myself
and
yet
it
is
strange
that
i
never
before
noticed
it
i
put
down
the
helm
in
a
moment
but
a
catastrophe
seemed
inevitable
we
surged
ahead
a
slight
shock
and
all
was
over
the
danger
was
passed
i
glanced
astern
to
look
again
at
the
dangerous
spot
but
the
rock
was
gone
and
where
but
a
moment
before
i
had
distinctly
seen
its
great
green
shadow
i
could
now
see
nothing
before
we
had
recovered
from
our
amazement
a
shout
from
jack
surprised
me
there
is
another
he
exclaimed
to
starboard
father
sure
enough
there
lay
apparently
another
sunken
rock
the
rock
is
moving
shouted
franz
and
a
great
black
body
emerged
from
the
sea
while
from
the
upper
extremity
rushed
a
column
of
water
which
with
a
mighty
noise
rose
upward
and
then
fell
like
rain
all
around
the
mystery
was
explained
for
as
the
great
beast
emerged
yet
further
from
the
water
i
recognized
from
its
enormous
size
and
great
length
of
head
the
cachalot
whale
the
monster
was
apparently
enraged
at
the
way
we
had
scratched
his
back
for
retreating
to
a
short
distance
he
evidently
meditated
a
rush
upon
us
fearful
stories
occurred
to
me
of
the
savage
temper
of
this
whale
how
he
has
been
known
to
destroy
boat
after
boat
and
even
ships
and
with
a
feeling
of
desperation
i
sprang
to
one
of
the
guns
jack
leaped
to
the
other
and
almost
simultaneously
we
fired
both
shots
apparently
took
effect
for
the
whale
after
lashing
the
water
violently
for
a
few
seconds
plunged
beneath
its
surface
and
disappeared
we
kept
a
sharp
lookout
for
him
for
i
was
unwilling
to
lose
such
a
valuable
prize
and
reloading
stood
toward
the
shore
in
which
direction
he
was
apparently
making
presently
we
again
sighted
him
in
shallow
water
lashing
fearfully
with
his
tail
and
dyeing
the
waves
around
him
with
blood
approaching
the
infuriated
animal
as
nearly
as
i
dared
we
again
fired
the
struggles
of
the
whale
seemed
for
a
few
moments
to
become
even
yet
more
frantic
and
then
with
a
quiver
from
head
to
tail
he
lay
motionless
dead
the
boys
were
about
to
raise
the
cry
of
victory
but
checked
the
shout
upon
their
very
lips
for
darting
behind
a
rock
they
espied
a
canoe
paddled
by
a
tall
and
muscular
savage
who
now
stood
up
in
his
skiff
and
appeared
to
be
examining
us
attentively
seeing
that
we
were
standing
toward
him
the
swarthy
native
seized
his
paddle
and
again
darted
behind
a
rock
an
awful
thought
now
took
possession
of
me
there
must
be
a
tribe
of
blacks
lurking
on
these
shores
and
fritz
must
have
fallen
into
their
hands
we
however
i
determined
should
not
be
easily
taken
and
our
guns
were
loaded
and
run
out
presently
a
dusky
face
appeared
peeping
at
us
from
a
lofty
rock
it
vanished
and
we
saw
another
peeping
at
us
from
lower
down
then
again
the
skiff
put
out
as
though
to
make
a
further
reconnoiter
all
even
jack
looked
anxious
and
glanced
at
me
for
orders
hoist
a
white
flag
said
i
and
hand
me
the
i
seized
the
instrument
and
uttered
such
peaceable
words
in
the
malay
language
as
i
could
recall
neither
the
flag
nor
my
words
seemed
to
produce
any
effect
and
the
savage
was
about
to
return
to
the
shore
jack
hereupon
lost
patience
and
in
his
turn
took
up
the
trumpet
come
here
you
black
son
of
a
gun
he
exclaimed
come
on
board
and
make
friends
or
we
blow
you
and
your
stop
stop
you
foolish
boy
i
said
you
will
but
alarm
the
man
with
your
wild
words
and
gestures
no
but
see
he
cried
he
is
paddling
toward
us
and
sure
enough
the
canoe
was
rapidly
approaching
presently
a
cry
from
franz
alarmed
me
look
look
he
shrieked
the
villain
is
in
fritz
cajack
i
can
see
the
walrus
head
ernest
alone
remained
unmoved
he
took
the
fritz
ahoy
he
shouted
welcome
old
fellow
the
words
were
scarcely
out
of
his
mouth
when
i
too
recognized
the
face
beneath
its
dusky
disguise
in
another
moment
the
brave
boy
was
on
board
and
in
spite
of
his
blackened
face
was
kissed
and
welcomed
heartily
he
was
now
assailed
with
a
storm
of
questions
from
all
sides
where
had
he
been
what
had
kept
him
so
long
and
why
had
he
turned
blackamoor
the
last
question
he
replied
with
a
smile
is
the
only
one
i
will
now
answer
the
others
shall
be
explained
when
i
give
a
full
account
of
my
adventures
hearing
guns
fired
my
mind
was
instantly
filled
with
ideas
of
malay
pirates
for
i
never
dreamed
that
you
could
be
here
in
the
yacht
so
i
disguised
myself
as
you
now
see
me
and
came
forth
to
reconnoiter
when
you
addressed
me
in
malay
you
only
added
to
my
terror
for
it
left
not
a
doubt
in
my
mind
that
you
were
pirates
having
in
our
turn
described
to
him
our
adventure
with
the
cachalot
whale
i
asked
him
if
he
knew
of
a
suitable
spot
for
the
anchorage
of
the
yacht
certainly
he
replied
casting
toward
me
a
glance
full
of
meaning
i
can
lead
you
to
an
island
where
there
is
a
splendid
anchorage
and
which
is
itself
well
worth
seeing
for
it
contains
all
sorts
of
strange
things
and
after
removing
the
stains
from
his
skin
and
turning
himself
once
more
into
a
civilized
being
he
again
sprang
into
his
canoe
and
piloted
us
to
a
picturesque
little
island
in
the
bay
now
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
success
of
expedition
i
no
longer
hesitated
to
give
to
my
wife
an
account
of
his
project
and
to
prepare
her
mind
for
the
surprise
which
awaited
her
she
was
greatly
startled
as
i
expected
and
seemed
almost
overcome
with
emotion
at
the
idea
of
seeing
a
human
being
and
that
being
one
of
her
own
sex
but
why
she
asked
did
you
not
tell
me
of
this
at
first
why
wait
until
the
last
moment
with
such
joyful
news
i
was
unwilling
i
replied
to
raise
hopes
which
might
never
be
realized
but
now
thank
heaven
he
has
succeeded
and
there
is
no
need
for
concealment
the
boys
could
not
at
all
understand
the
evident
air
of
mystery
and
suppressed
excitement
which
neither
their
mother
fritz
nor
i
could
entirely
conceal
they
cast
glances
of
the
greatest
curiosity
toward
the
island
and
as
soon
as
the
sails
were
furled
and
the
anchor
dropped
they
sprang
eagerly
ashore
in
a
body
we
followed
fritz
maintaining
perfect
silence
presently
we
emerged
from
the
thicket
through
which
we
were
passing
and
saw
before
us
a
hut
of
sheltering
boughs
at
the
entrance
of
which
burned
a
cheerful
fire
into
this
leafy
bower
fritz
dived
leaving
his
brothers
without
mute
with
astonishment
in
another
moment
he
emerged
leading
by
the
hand
a
slight
handsome
youth
by
his
dress
apparently
a
young
english
naval
officer
the
pair
advanced
to
meet
us
and
fritz
with
a
countenance
radiant
with
joy
briefly
introduced
his
companion
as
edward
montrose
and
he
continued
looking
at
his
mother
and
me
will
you
not
welcome
him
as
a
friend
and
a
brother
to
our
family
circle
that
will
we
indeed
i
exclaimed
advancing
and
holding
out
my
hands
to
the
fair
young
stranger
our
wild
life
may
have
roughened
our
looks
and
manners
but
it
has
not
hardened
our
hearts
i
trust
the
mother
too
embraced
the
seeming
youth
most
heartily
the
lads
and
even
the
dogs
were
not
behind
hand
in
testifying
their
gratification
at
the
appearance
of
their
new
friend
the
former
delighted
at
the
idea
of
a
fresh
companion
and
the
latter
won
by
her
sweet
voice
and
appearance
from
the
expression
made
use
of
by
fritz
i
perceived
that
the
girl
wished
her
sex
to
remain
unrevealed
to
the
rest
of
the
party
until
the
mother
could
obtain
for
her
a
costume
more
suited
to
her
real
character
the
young
men
then
ran
down
to
the
yacht
to
bring
up
what
was
necessary
for
supper
as
well
as
to
make
preparations
for
a
camp
in
which
we
might
spend
the
night
this
done
the
mother
hastened
to
set
before
us
a
substantial
meal
while
the
boys
anxious
to
make
their
new
acquaintance
feel
at
home
among
them
were
doing
their
best
to
amuse
her
she
herself
after
the
first
feeling
of
strangeness
had
worn
off
entered
fully
into
all
their
fun
and
by
the
time
they
sat
down
to
supper
was
laughing
and
chattering
as
gayly
as
anyone
of
the
rest
she
admired
the
various
dishes
tasted
our
mead
and
without
alluding
once
to
her
previous
life
kept
up
a
lively
conversation
the
mere
fact
of
meeting
with
any
human
being
after
so
many
years
of
isolation
was
in
itself
sufficient
to
raise
the
boys
to
the
greatest
state
of
excitement
but
that
this
being
should
be
one
so
handsome
so
gay
so
perfectly
charming
seemed
completely
to
have
turned
their
heads
and
when
i
gave
the
sign
for
breaking
up
of
the
feast
and
their
new
friend
was
about
to
be
led
to
the
night
quarters
which
had
been
prepared
for
her
on
board
the
yacht
the
health
of
edward
montrose
was
proposed
and
drank
in
fragrant
mead
amid
the
cheers
and
acclamations
of
all
hands
when
she
was
gone
and
silence
had
been
restored
jack
exclaimed
now
then
fritz
if
you
please
just
tell
me
where
you
came
across
this
jolly
fellow
did
you
take
your
mysterious
voyage
in
search
of
him
or
did
you
meet
him
by
chance
out
with
your
adventures
while
we
sit
comfortably
round
the
fire
so
saying
jack
cast
more
wood
upon
the
blazing
pile
and
throwing
himself
down
in
his
usual
careless
fashion
prepared
to
listen
attentively
fritz
after
a
few
moments
hesitation
began
perhaps
you
remember
said
he
how
when
i
returned
from
my
expedition
in
the
cajack
the
other
day
i
struck
down
an
albatross
none
but
my
father
at
the
time
knew
however
what
became
of
the
wounded
bird
or
even
thought
more
about
it
yet
it
was
that
albatross
who
brought
me
notice
of
the
shipwrecked
stranger
and
he
too
i
determined
should
carry
back
a
message
to
cheer
and
encourage
the
sender
i
first
as
you
know
prepared
my
cajack
to
carry
two
persons
and
then
with
a
heart
full
of
hope
and
trust
left
you
and
the
yacht
and
with
pounce
seated
before
me
made
for
the
open
sea
for
several
hours
i
paddled
steadily
on
till
the
wind
freshening
i
thought
it
advisable
to
keep
in
nearer
shore
that
should
a
regular
storm
arise
i
might
find
some
sheltered
bay
in
which
to
weather
it
it
was
well
i
did
so
for
scarcely
had
i
reached
a
quiet
cove
which
promised
to
afford
me
the
protection
i
desired
than
the
sea
appeared
one
mass
of
foam
great
surging
waves
arose
and
even
in
the
comparative
calm
of
the
bay
i
felt
that
i
was
in
some
danger
i
passed
the
night
in
my
cajack
and
next
morning
after
a
frugal
meal
of
pemmican
and
a
draught
of
water
from
my
flask
once
more
ventured
forth
the
wind
had
subsided
and
the
sea
was
tolerably
smooth
and
keeping
my
eyes
busily
employed
in
seeking
in
every
direction
to
detect
if
possible
the
slightest
trace
of
smoke
or
other
sign
of
human
life
i
paddled
on
till
noon
the
aspect
of
the
coast
now
began
to
change
the
shores
were
sandy
while
further
inland
lay
dense
forests
from
whose
gloomy
depths
i
could
ever
and
anon
hear
the
fierce
roar
of
beasts
of
prey
the
yell
of
apes
the
fiendish
laugh
of
the
hyena
or
the
despairing
death
cry
of
a
hapless
deer
seldom
have
i
experienced
a
greater
feeling
of
solitude
than
while
listening
to
these
strange
sounds
and
knowing
that
i
in
this
frail
canoe
was
the
only
human
being
near
giving
myself
up
to
contemplation
i
rested
my
paddle
and
allowed
my
cajack
to
drift
slowly
on
as
i
neared
the
shore
i
noticed
a
large
number
of
stranger
looking
birds
who
would
sometimes
flutter
round
me
and
then
dart
back
again
to
the
border
of
the
forest
where
they
were
feeding
on
what
appeared
to
be
the
pepper
plant
they
seized
the
berries
in
their
great
ponderous
beaks
threw
them
up
into
the
air
and
then
dexterously
caught
them
in
their
fall
their
beaks
were
really
something
extraordinary
they
looked
as
though
they
must
give
their
owners
a
perpetual
headache
from
their
immense
weight
the
only
thing
that
relieved
the
extreme
ugliness
of
these
great
appendages
was
their
gorgeous
color
which
was
only
rivaled
by
the
gay
hue
of
the
plumage
i
wish
now
that
i
had
brought
home
a
specimen
but
at
the
time
i
was
so
much
amused
by
watching
the
grotesque
antics
of
the
birds
that
i
did
not
think
of
obtaining
one
when
i
left
the
spot
i
settled
in
my
own
mind
that
they
were
toucans
was
i
right
ernest
the
professor
unwilling
to
interrupt
the
narrative
merely
gave
an
oracular
nod
and
fritz
continued
for
some
hours
after
this
i
paddled
quickly
on
sometimes
passing
the
mouth
of
a
stream
sometimes
that
of
a
broad
river
had
i
been
merely
on
an
exploring
expedition
i
should
have
been
tempted
doubtless
to
cruise
a
little
way
up
one
of
these
pathways
into
the
forest
but
now
such
an
idea
did
not
enter
my
head
on
on
on
i
felt
i
must
go
until
i
should
reach
the
goal
of
my
voyage
the
shades
of
night
at
length
drew
on
and
finding
a
sheltered
cove
i
moored
my
cajack
and
stepped
on
shore
you
may
imagine
how
pleasant
it
was
to
stretch
my
legs
after
sitting
for
so
long
in
the
cramped
position
which
my
cajack
enforces
it
would
not
do
however
to
sleep
on
shore
so
after
preparing
and
enjoying
my
supper
i
returned
on
board
and
there
spent
the
night
next
morning
pounce
and
i
again
landed
for
breakfast
i
lit
my
fire
and
hung
before
it
a
plump
young
parrot
to
roast
as
i
was
so
doing
i
heard
a
slight
rustle
among
the
long
grass
behind
me
i
glanced
round
and
there
with
glaring
eyes
and
his
great
tail
swaying
to
and
fro
i
saw
an
immense
tiger
illustration
with
glaring
eyes
and
his
great
tail
swaying
to
and
fro
i
saw
an
immense
in
another
moment
his
spring
would
have
been
made
i
should
have
been
no
more
and
our
young
guest
would
have
been
doomed
to
god
only
knows
how
many
years
of
frightful
solitude
my
gun
was
lying
by
my
side
before
i
could
have
stooped
to
pick
it
up
the
monster
would
have
seized
me
pounce
saw
and
comprehended
my
danger
the
heroic
bird
darted
upon
my
enemy
and
so
blinded
him
with
his
flapping
wings
and
the
fierce
blows
of
his
beak
that
his
spring
was
checked
and
i
had
time
to
recover
my
i
seized
my
gun
and
fired
and
the
brute
pierced
to
the
heart
gave
one
spring
and
then
rolled
over
at
my
feet
my
enemy
was
dead
but
beside
him
alas
lay
poor
pounce
crushed
and
lifeless
one
blow
of
the
great
beast
paw
had
struck
him
down
never
to
rise
again
fritz
voice
shook
as
he
came
to
this
point
and
after
remaining
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
he
continued
hurriedly
with
a
sad
and
desolate
feeling
at
my
heart
i
buried
the
faithful
bird
where
he
had
met
his
death
and
then
unable
longer
to
continue
near
the
spot
i
returned
to
my
cajack
and
leaving
the
great
tiger
lying
where
he
fell
paddled
hastily
away
my
thoughts
were
gloomy
i
felt
as
though
now
that
my
companion
was
gone
i
could
no
longer
continue
the
voyage
the
albatross
i
thought
may
have
flown
for
hundreds
of
miles
before
it
reached
me
this
stranger
may
be
on
different
shores
from
these
entirely
every
stroke
of
my
paddle
may
be
carrying
me
further
from
the
blazing
signal
who
knows
this
feeling
of
discouragement
was
not
however
to
be
of
long
duration
for
in
a
moment
more
a
sight
presented
itself
which
banished
all
my
doubts
and
fears
and
raised
me
to
the
highest
pitch
of
excitement
a
high
point
of
land
lay
before
me
i
rounded
it
and
beyond
found
a
calm
and
pleasant
bay
from
whose
curved
and
thickly
wooded
shores
ran
out
a
reef
of
rocks
from
the
point
of
this
reef
rose
a
column
of
smoke
steadily
and
clearly
curling
upward
in
the
calm
air
i
could
scarcely
believe
my
senses
but
stopped
gazing
at
it
as
though
i
were
in
a
dream
then
with
throbbing
pulse
and
giddy
brain
i
seized
my
paddle
and
strained
every
nerve
to
reach
it
a
few
strokes
seemed
to
carry
me
across
the
bay
and
securing
my
canoe
i
leaped
upon
the
rock
on
which
the
beacon
was
blazing
but
not
a
sign
of
a
human
being
could
i
see
i
was
about
to
shout
for
as
the
fire
had
evidently
been
recently
piled
up
i
knew
the
stranger
could
not
be
far
off
but
before
i
could
do
so
i
saw
a
slight
figure
passing
along
the
chain
of
rocks
toward
the
spot
on
which
i
stood
you
may
all
imagine
my
sensations
i
advanced
a
few
paces
and
then
mastering
my
emotion
as
best
i
could
i
said
in
english
fair
stranger
god
in
his
mercy
has
heard
your
call
and
has
sent
me
to
your
aid
miss
montrose
came
quickly
forward
who
what
shouted
the
boys
interrupting
the
narrative
who
came
forward
and
amid
a
general
hubbub
ernest
rising
and
advancing
to
his
brother
said
in
his
quiet
way
i
did
not
like
to
make
any
remark
till
you
actually
let
out
the
secret
fritz
but
we
need
no
longer
pretend
not
to
see
through
the
disguise
of
edward
montrose
fritz
though
much
disconcerted
by
the
discovery
of
the
secret
recovered
his
and
after
bearing
with
perfect
equanimity
the
jokes
with
which
his
brothers
assailed
him
joined
in
three
cheers
for
their
new
sister
and
when
the
confusion
and
laughter
which
ensued
had
subsided
continued
his
story
miss
montrose
grasped
my
hands
warmly
and
guessing
from
my
pronunciation
i
am
afraid
that
i
was
not
in
the
habit
of
speaking
english
every
day
of
my
life
said
in
french
long
have
i
waited
since
the
bird
returned
with
your
message
thank
god
you
have
come
at
last
then
with
tears
of
joy
and
gratitude
she
led
me
to
the
shore
where
she
had
built
a
hut
and
a
safe
like
falconhurst
on
a
small
scale
among
the
branches
of
a
tree
i
was
delighted
with
all
she
showed
me
for
indeed
her
hut
and
its
fittings
evinced
no
ordinary
skill
and
ingenuity
round
the
walls
hung
bows
arrows
lances
and
while
on
her
in
boxes
and
cases
carved
skillfully
with
a
knife
were
of
needles
made
from
and
bodkins
from
the
beaks
of
birds
of
all
sorts
and
knives
and
other
tools
these
latter
she
told
me
were
with
a
chest
of
wearing
apparel
almost
the
only
things
washed
ashore
after
the
wreck
when
three
years
ago
she
was
cast
alone
upon
this
desolate
coast
i
marveled
more
and
more
at
the
wonderful
way
in
which
this
girl
had
surmounted
obstacles
the
quarter
of
which
would
completely
have
appalled
the
generality
of
her
sex
the
hut
itself
was
a
marvel
of
skill
stout
posts
had
been
driven
into
the
ground
with
cross
pieces
of
bamboo
to
form
a
framework
the
walls
had
been
woven
with
reeds
the
roof
thatched
with
and
the
whole
plastered
smoothly
with
clay
an
open
space
being
left
in
the
center
of
the
roof
for
a
chimney
to
carry
off
the
smoke
of
the
fire
as
we
entered
a
cormorant
with
a
cry
of
anger
flew
from
under
the
table
toward
me
and
was
about
to
attack
me
fiercely
miss
montrose
called
it
off
and
she
then
told
me
she
had
captured
and
tamed
the
bird
soon
after
first
landing
and
since
that
time
had
contrived
to
train
it
to
assist
her
in
every
conceivable
way
it
now
not
only
was
a
pleasant
companion
but
brought
her
food
of
every
description
fish
flesh
and
fowl
for
whether
it
dived
into
the
waters
according
to
its
natural
habit
struck
down
birds
upon
the
wing
or
seized
rabbits
and
other
small
animals
upon
the
land
it
laid
all
its
booty
at
her
feet
before
darkness
closed
in
all
the
curiosities
and
ingenious
contrivances
of
the
place
had
been
displayed
the
kitchen
stove
cooking
utensils
skin
bottles
shell
plates
and
spoons
the
fishing
raft
and
numberless
other
things
and
then
sitting
down
with
my
fair
hostess
to
a
most
appetizing
meal
she
gave
me
a
short
account
of
her
life
jenny
montrose
was
the
daughter
of
a
british
officer
who
had
served
for
many
years
in
india
where
she
herself
was
born
at
the
early
age
of
three
years
she
lost
her
mother
after
the
death
of
his
wife
all
the
colonel
love
and
care
was
centered
upon
his
only
child
under
his
eye
she
was
instructed
in
all
the
accomplishments
suited
to
her
sex
and
from
him
she
imbibed
an
ardent
love
of
field
sports
by
the
time
she
was
seventeen
she
was
as
much
at
home
upon
her
horse
in
the
field
as
in
her
father
drawing
room
colonel
montrose
now
received
orders
to
return
home
with
his
regiment
and
as
for
certain
reasons
he
did
not
wish
her
to
accompany
him
in
the
ship
with
the
troops
he
obtained
a
passage
for
her
on
board
a
vessel
which
was
about
to
sail
at
the
same
time
the
separation
was
extremely
painful
to
both
the
old
soldier
and
his
daughter
but
there
was
no
alternative
they
parted
and
miss
montrose
sailed
in
the
dorcas
for
england
a
week
after
she
had
left
calcutta
a
storm
arose
and
drove
the
vessel
far
out
of
her
course

bad
weather
ensued
and
at
length
leaks
having
been
sprung
in
all
directions
the
crew
were
obliged
to
take
to
the
boats
jenny
obtained
a
place
in
one
of
the
largest
of
these
after
enduring
the
perils
of
the
sea
for
many
days
land
was
sighted
and
the
other
boats
having
disappeared
an
attempt
was
made
to
land
the
boat
was
capsized
and
miss
montrose
alone
reached
the
shore
for
a
long
time
she
lay
upon
the
sand
almost
inanimate
but
reviving
sufficiently
to
move
she
at
length
obtained
some
and
by
degrees
recovered
her
strength
from
that
time
forth
until
i
appeared
she
never
set
eyes
upon
a
human
being
to
attract
any
passing
vessel
and
obtain
assistance
however
she
kept
a
beacon
continually
blazing
at
the
end
of
the
reef
and
with
the
same
purpose
in
view
attached
missives
to
the
feet
of
any
birds
she
could
take
alive
in
her
snares
the
albatross
she
told
me
she
had
kept
for
some
time
and
partially
tamed
but
as
it
was
in
the
habit
of
making
long
excursions
on
its
own
account
she
conceived
the
idea
of
sending
it
also
with
a
message
that
should
it
by
chance
be
seen
and
taken
alive
it
might
return
with
an
answer
our
supper
was
over
and
at
length
both
wearied
out
with
the
anxieties
and
excitement
of
the
day
we
retired
to
rest
she
to
her
leafy
bower
and
i
to
sleep
in
the
hut
below
next
morning
having
packed
her
belongings
in
the
cajack
we
both
went
on
board
and
bidding
adieu
to
her
bay
she
took
her
seat
before
me
and
i
made
for
home
we
should
have
reached
rockburg
this
evening
had
not
an
accident
occurred
to
our
skiff
and
compelled
us
to
put
in
at
this
island
the
boat
was
scarcely
repaired
when
i
heard
your
first
shots
i
instantly
disguised
myself
and
never
doubting
that
malay
pirates
were
near
came
forth
to
reconnoiter
glad
indeed
i
was
to
find
my
fears
ungrounded
all
had
listened
attentively
to
fritz
story
but
now
a
dreadful
yawn
from
franz
followed
by
others
from
jack
ernest
and
fritz
and
a
great
desire
on
my
own
part
to
follow
their
example
warned
me
that
it
was
time
to
dismiss
the
party
for
the
night
fritz
retired
to
his
cajack
the
boys
and
i
to
the
deck
of
the
yacht
and
the
remainder
of
the
night
passed
quietly
away
next
morning
as
we
assembled
for
breakfast
i
took
the
opportunity
of
begging
miss
montrose
no
longer
to
attempt
to
continue
her
disguise
but
to
allow
us
to
address
her
in
her
real
character
jenny
smiled
for
she
had
noticed
as
the
young
men
met
her
when
she
came
from
the
cabin
a
great
alteration
in
their
manner
and
had
at
once
seen
that
her
secret
was
guessed
after
all
she
said
i
need
not
be
ashamed
of
this
attire
it
has
been
my
only
costume
for
the
last
three
years
and
in
any
other
i
should
have
been
unable
to
manage
all
the
work
which
during
that
time
has
been
necessary
our
pleasant
meal
over
i
prepared
to
start
for
home
but
fritz
reminded
me
of
the
cachalot
and
although
he
confessed
he
should
not
care
to
repeat
the
operation
of
cutting
up
a
whale
he
thought
it
would
be
a
pity
to
lose
such
a
chance
of
obtaining
a
supply
of
spermaceti
i
fully
agreed
with
him
and
embarking
we
quickly
reached
the
sandbank
on
which
the
monster
lay
no
sooner
did
we
come
near
than
the
dogs
leaped
ashore
and
before
we
could
follow
rushed
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
great
beast
snarling
growling
and
howling
ensued
and
when
we
reached
the
spot
we
found
a
terrific
combat
going
on
a
troop
of
wolves
were
disputing
fiercely
with
the
dogs
their
right
to
the
prey
our
appearance
however
quickly
settled
the
matter
two
of
the
brutes
already
lay
dead
and
those
that
now
escaped
our
guns
galloped
off
among
the
pack
were
a
few
jackals
and
no
sooner
did
coco
catch
sight
of
these
his
relations
than
suddenly
attracted
by
his
instinct
he
left
his
master
side
and
in
spite
of
our
shouts
and
cries
joined
them
and
disappeared
into
the
forest
as
it
would
have
been
useless
and
dangerous
to
attempt
to
follow
the
deserter
into
the
woods
we
left
him
alone
trusting
that
he
would
return
before
we
again
embarked
fritz
then
climbed
up
the
mountain
of
flesh
and
with
his
hatchet
quickly
laid
open
the
huge
skull
jack
and
franz
joined
him
ernest
having
remained
on
the
island
where
we
had
left
the
mother
and
jenny
and
with
buckets
assisted
him
to
bail
out
the
spermaceti
the
few
vessels
we
possessed
were
soon
full
and
having
stored
them
in
the
yacht
we
once
more
embarked
and
arrived
at
the
little
island
shortly
before
the
dinner
hour
a
capital
meal
had
been
prepared
for
us
and
when
we
had
made
ourselves
presentable
we
sat
down
to
it
and
related
our
adventures
the
account
of
coco
desertion
was
received
with
exclamations
of
surprise
and
sorrow
yet
said
jenny
after
a
time
i
do
not
think
you
should
despair
of
his
recovery
for
animals
in
their
native
state
seldom
care
to
allow
those
that
have
been
once
domesticated
to
consort
with
them
my
poor
albatross
even
though
he
was
never
thoroughly
tamed
and
certainly
did
finally
desert
me
yet
used
to
return
at
intervals
and
i
am
pretty
sure
that
were
you
jack
to
search
the
wood
early
morning
you
would
find
your
pet
only
too
willing
to
come
back
to
civilized
life
or
if
you
like
i
will
go
myself
and
find
him
for
i
should
immensely
like
to
have
a
paddle
in
the
cajack
all
by
myself
jack
was
delighted
at
the
former
suggestion
and
though
he
would
not
listen
for
a
moment
to
jenny
request
to
be
allowed
to
go
alone
he
agreed
if
she
cared
for
the
fun
of
an
early
cruise
to
accompany
her
in
the
canoe
next
morning
and
to
return
to
the
yacht
in
time
to
start
for
rockburg
at
sunrise
they
were
off
armed
with
bait
in
the
shape
of
meat
and
biscuit
and
a
muzzle
and
chain
which
jack
had
manufactured
in
the
evening
to
punish
the
runagate
for
his
offenses
should
they
catch
him
arrived
at
the
sandbank
they
landed
and
after
entering
the
forest
and
shouting
coco
coco
till
the
woods
rang
again
they
presently
espied
the
truant
slouching
disconsolately
toward
them
looking
very
miserable
and
heartily
ashamed
of
himself
with
torn
ears
and
coat
ruffled
and
dirty
he
sneaked
up
there
was
no
need
to
use
the
bait
to
entice
him
and
when
the
poor
beast
thus
came
unhappy
and
begging
forgiveness
jack
had
not
the
heart
to
degrade
him
further
with
the
muzzle
and
chain
he
had
evidently
attempted
to
join
his
wild
brethren
and
by
them
had
been
scouted
worried
and
hustled
as
no
true
jackal
and
as
jenny
had
foretold
was
now
only
too
glad
to
return
to
bondage
and
to
comfort
poor
coco
had
recovered
his
spirits
slightly
by
the
time
the
yacht
was
reached
and
after
a
hearty
meal
again
took
his
place
among
the
dogs
whom
i
had
little
doubt
he
would
never
again
desert
all
was
now
bustle
and
activity
and
breakfast
over
we
went
aboard
the
yacht
fritz
and
jack
stepped
into
the
canoe
and
we
soon
left
fair
isle
and
pearl
bay
far
behind
the
morning
was
delightful
the
sea
excepting
for
the
slight
ripple
raised
by
the
gentle
breeze
wafting
us
homeward
was
perfectly
calm
slowly
and
contentedly
we
glided
on
through
the
wonders
of
the
splendid
archway
threaded
our
passage
among
the
rocks
and
shoals
and
passed
out
to
the
open
sea
so
slowly
did
we
make
our
way
that
the
occupants
of
the
cajack
announced
that
they
could
not
wait
for
us
when
they
had
once
piloted
us
out
from
among
the
shoals
and
reefs
and
plied
their
paddles
to
such
good
purpose
that
they
were
soon
out
of
sight
nautilus
bay
and
cape
were
in
due
time
passed
however
and
shark
island
hove
in
sight
with
great
astonishment
jenny
gazed
at
our
watch
tower
with
its
the
guns
and
the
waving
flag
upon
the
heights
we
landed
that
she
might
visit
the
fortification
when
we
displayed
all
our
arrangements
with
great
pride
when
they
and
the
herd
of
lovely
gazelles
had
been
sufficiently
admired
we
again
embarked
and
steered
toward
deliverance
bay
on
reaching
the
entrance
a
grand
salute
of
twelve
shots
welcomed
us
and
our
fair
guest
to
rockburg
not
pleased
with
the
even
number
however
ernest
insisted
upon
replying
with
thirteen
guns
an
odd
number
being
he
declared
absolutely
necessary
for
form
sake
as
we
neared
the
quay
fritz
and
jack
stood
ready
to
receive
us
and
with
true
politeness
handed
their
mother
and
jenny
ashore
they
turned
and
led
the
way
to
the
house
through
the
gardens
orchards
and
shrubberies
which
lay
on
the
rising
ground
that
sloped
gently
upward
to
our
dwelling
jenny
surprise
was
changed
to
wonder
as
she
neared
the
villa
itself
its
broad
shady
balcony
its
fountains
sparkling
in
the
sun
the
dovecots
the
pigeons
wheeling
above
and
the
bright
fresh
creepers
twined
round
the
columns
delighted
her
she
could
scarcely
believe
that
she
was
still
far
from
any
civilized
nation
and
that
she
was
among
a
family
wrecked
like
herself
upon
a
lonely
coast
my
amazement
however
fully
equaled
that
of
my
little
daughter
when
beneath
the
shade
of
the
veranda
i
saw
a
table
laid
out
with
a
delicious
luncheon
all
our
china
silver
and
glass
had
been
called
into
requisition
and
was
arranged
upon
the
spotless
damask
cloth
wine
sparkled
in
the
decanters
splendid
oranges
guavas
apples
and
pears
resting
on
cool
green
leaves
lay
heaped
in
pyramids
upon
the
porcelain
dishes
a
haunch
of
venison
cold
fowl
ham
and
tongues
occupied
the
ends
and
sides
of
the
table
while
in
the
center
rose
a
vase
of
gay
flowers
surrounded
by
bowls
of
milk
and
great
jugs
of
mead
it
was
indeed
a
perfect
feast
and
the
heartiness
of
the
welcome
brought
tears
of
joy
into
the
lovely
eyes
of
the
fair
girl
in
whose
honor
it
had
been
devised
all
were
soon
ready
to
sit
down
and
jenny
looking
prettier
than
ever
in
the
dress
for
which
she
had
exchanged
her
sailor
suit
took
the
place
of
honor
between
the
mother
and
me
ernest
and
franz
also
seated
themselves
but
nothing
would
induce
fritz
and
jack
to
follow
their
example
they
considered
themselves
our
entertainers
and
waited
upon
us
most
attentively
carving
the
joints
filling
our
glasses
and
changing
the
plates
for
as
jack
declared
to
miss
montrose
the
servants
had
all
run
away
in
our
absence
and
for
the
next
day
or
two
perhaps
we
should
be
obliged
to
wait
upon
ourselves
when
the
banquet
was
over
and
the
waiters
had
satisfied
their
appetites
they
joined
their
brothers
and
with
them
displayed
all
the
wonders
of
rockburg
to
their
new
sister
to
the
house
cave
stables
gardens
fields
and
boathouses
to
one
after
the
other
did
they
lead
her
not
a
corner
would
they
have
left
unnoticed
had
not
the
mother
fearing
they
would
tire
the
poor
girl
out
come
to
the
rescue
and
led
her
back
to
the
house
on
the
following
day
after
an
early
breakfast
we
started
while
it
was
yet
cool
for
falconhurst
and
as
i
knew
that
repairs
and
arrangements
for
the
coming
winter
would
be
necessary
and
would
detain
us
for
several
days
we
took
with
us
a
supply
of
tools
as
well
as
baskets
of
provisions
and
other
things
essential
to
our
comfort
the
whole
of
our
stud
excepting
the
ostrich
were
in
their
paddocks
near
the
tree
but
jack
saying
that
his
mother
and
jenny
really
must
not
walk
the
whole
way
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
latter
leaped
on
hurry
and
fled
away
in
front
of
us
before
we
had
accomplished
one
quarter
of
the
distance
we
heard
the
thundering
tread
of
many
feet
galloping
down
the
avenue
and
presently
espied
our
motley
troop
of
steeds
being
driven
furiously
toward
us
storm
lightfoot
swift
grumble
stentor
arrow
and
dart
were
there
with
jack
on
his
fleet
courser
at
their
heels
at
his
hung
a
cluster
of
saddles
and
bridles
and
bits
all
jangling
and
clanking
adding
to
the
din
and
confusion
and
urging
on
the
excited
animals
who
thoroughly
entered
into
the
fun
and
with
tails
in
the
air
ears
back
and
heels
ever
and
anon
thrown
playfully
out
seemed
about
to
overwhelm
us
we
stepped
aside
to
shelter
ourselves
behind
the
trees
from
the
furious
onset
but
a
shout
from
fritz
brought
the
whole
herd
to
a
sudden
halt
and
jack
spurred
toward
us
which
of
the
cattle
shall
we
saddle
for
you
jenny
he
shouted
they
all
as
gentle
as
lambs
and
as
active
as
cats
every
one
has
been
ridden
by
mother
and
knows
what
a
means
so
you
go
wrong
to
his
great
delight
jenny
quickly
showed
her
appreciation
of
the
merits
of
the
steeds
by
picking
out
dart
the
fleetest
and
most
spirited
in
the
whole
stud
the
ostrich
was
then
relieved
of
his
unusual
burden
the
animals
were
speedily
equipped
and
lightfoot
bearing
the
baskets
and
hampers
the
whole
party
mounted
and
trotted
forward
jenny
was
delighted
with
her
palfrey
and
henceforward
he
was
reserved
for
her
special
use
the
work
at
falconhurst
as
i
had
expected
occupied
us
for
some
time
and
it
was
a
week
before
we
could
again
return
to
rockburg
yet
the
time
passed
pleasantly
for
though
the
young
men
were
busy
from
morning
to
night
the
presence
of
their
new
companion
her
lively
spirits
and
gay
conversation
kept
them
in
constant
good
humor
when
the
repairs
were
all
finished
we
remained
yet
a
day
or
two
longer
that
we
might
make
excursions
in
various
directions
to
bring
in
poultry
from
woodlands
stores
of
acorns
for
the
pigs
and
grass
willows
and
canes
to
be
manufactured
during
the
winter
into
mats
baskets
hurdles
and
many
a
shower
wetted
us
through
during
these
days
and
we
had
scarcely
time
to
hurry
back
to
rockburg
and
house
our
cattle
and
possessions
before
the
annual
deluge
began
never
before
had
this
dreary
season
seemed
so
short
and
pleasant
with
jenny
among
us
the
usual
feeling
of
weariness
and
discontent
never
appeared
the
english
language
was
quickly
acquired
by
all
hands
fritz
in
particular
speaking
it
so
well
that
jenny
declared
she
could
scarcely
believe
he
was
not
an
englishman
she
herself
already
spoke
french
and
therefore
easily
learned
our
native
language
and
spoke
it
fluently
before
we
were
released
from
our
captivity
chapter
xviii
a
sail
farewell
to
shark
island
many
wondrous
tales
were
told
or
read
in
turn
by
the
boys
and
jenny
during
the
long
evenings
as
we
sat
drawing
weaving
and
plaiting
in
our
cozy
study
in
fact
this
winter
was
a
truly
happy
time
and
when
at
length
the
rain
ceased
and
the
bright
sun
again
smiled
upon
the
face
of
nature
we
could
scarcely
believe
as
we
stepped
forth
and
once
more
felt
the
balmy
breath
of
spring
that
for
so
many
weeks
we
had
been
prisoners
within
our
rocky
walls
all
was
once
more
activity
and
life
the
duties
in
field
garden
and
orchard
called
forth
the
energy
of
the
lads
while
their
mother
and
sister
found
abundant
occupation
in
the
poultry
yard
and
house
our
various
settlements
and
stations
required
attention
falconhurst
woodlands
prospect
hill
shark
and
whale
islands
were
in
turn
visited
and
set
in
order
the
duty
of
attending
to
the
island
battery
fell
to
jack
and
franz
they
had
been
busy
all
day
repairing
the
flagstaff
rehoisting
the
flag
and
cleaning
and
putting
into
working
order
the
two
guns
evening
was
drawing
on
and
our
day
work
over
the
rest
of
us
were
strolling
up
and
down
upon
the
beach
enjoying
the
cool
sea
breeze
they
loaded
and
ran
out
their
guns
and
paddling
off
with
an
empty
tub
in
the
cajack
placed
it
out
at
sea
as
a
mark
for
practice
they
returned
and
fired
and
the
barrel
flew
in
pieces
and
then
with
a
shout
of
triumph
they
cleaned
the
guns
and
ran
them
in
scarcely
had
they
done
so
when
as
though
in
answer
to
their
shots
came
the
sound
of
three
guns
booming
across
the
water
from
the
westward
we
stopped
speechless
was
it
fancy
had
we
really
heard
guns
from
a
strange
ship
or
had
the
boys
again
fired
no
there
were
the
lads
leaping
into
their
canoe
and
paddling
in
hot
haste
toward
us
they
too
had
heard
the
sound
a
tumult
of
feelings
rushed
over
us
anxiety
joy
hope
doubt
each
in
turn
took
possession
of
our
minds
was
it
a
european
vessel
close
upon
our
shores
and
were
we
about
to
be
linked
once
more
to
civilized
life
or
did
those
sounds
proceed
from
a
malay
pirate
who
would
rob
and
murder
us
what
was
to
be
the
result
of
meeting
with
our
fellow
beings
were
they
to
be
friends
who
would
help
us
enemies
who
would
attack
us
or
would
they
prove
unfortunate
creatures
in
need
of
our
assistance
who
could
tell
before
we
could
express
these
thoughts
in
words
the
cajack
had
touched
the
shore
and
jack
and
franz
were
among
us
did
you
hear
them
did
you
hear
them
they
gasped
what
shall
we
do
where
shall
we
go
o
fritz
continued
my
youngest
son
it
must
be
a
european
ship
we
shall
find
her
we
shall
see
our
fatherland
once
more
and
in
an
emotion
of
joy
he
grasped
his
brother
hands
till
then
i
knew
not
what
a
craving
for
civilized
life
had
been
aroused
in
the
two
young
men
by
the
appearance
of
their
european
sister
all
eyes
were
turned
toward
me
what
would
i
advise
at
present
i
said
we
can
do
nothing
for
night
is
drawing
on
we
must
make
what
preparations
we
can
and
pray
for
guidance
in
the
greatest
excitement
we
returned
to
the
house
all
talking
eagerly
and
till
late
no
one
could
be
persuaded
to
retire
to
rest
few
slept
that
night
the
boys
and
i
took
it
in
turn
to
keep
watch
from
the
veranda
lest
more
signals
might
be
fired
or
a
hostile
visit
might
be
paid
us
but
about
midnight
the
wind
began
to
rise
and
before
we
to
discuss
our
plans
a
fearful
storm
was
raging
so
terrific
was
the
sea
that
i
knew
no
boat
could
live
and
had
a
broadside
been
fired
at
the
entrance
of
the
bay
we
should
not
have
heard
it
through
the
howling
of
the
blast
for
two
days
and
two
nights
the
hurricane
continued
but
on
the
third
day
the
sun
again
appeared
and
the
wind
lulling
the
sea
went
rapidly
down
full
of
anxiety
i
readily
complied
with
the
boys
desire
to
put
off
to
shark
island
and
discharge
the
guns
for
who
could
tell
what
had
been
the
result
of
the
gale
perhaps
the
vessel
had
been
driven
upon
the
rocky
shore
or
fearing
such
a
fate
she
had
left
the
coast
and
weathered
the
storm
out
at
sea
if
so
she
might
never
return
with
these
thoughts
i
accompanied
jack
and
franz
to
the
fort
one
two
we
fired
the
guns
and
waited
for
some
minutes
there
was
no
reply
and
then
an
answering
report
rolled
in
the
distance
there
was
no
longer
room
for
doubt
the
strangers
were
still
in
the
vicinity
and
were
aware
of
our
presence
we
waved
the
flag
as
a
signal
to
those
on
shore
that
all
was
well
and
quickly
returned
we
found
the
whole
family
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
excitement
and
i
felt
it
necessary
to
calm
them
down
as
much
as
possible
for
neither
could
i
answer
the
questions
with
which
i
was
besieged
nor
could
i
conceal
the
fact
that
the
visit
of
the
vessel
might
not
prove
so
advantageous
as
they
expected
fritz
and
i
at
once
prepared
to
make
a
reconnoissance
we
armed
ourselves
with
our
guns
pistols
and
cutlasses
took
a
spyglass
seated
ourselves
in
the
cajack
and
with
a
parting
entreaty
from
the
mother
to
be
cautious
paddled
out
of
the
bay
and
round
the
high
cliffs
on
our
left
for
nearly
an
hour
we
advanced
in
the
direction
from
which
the
reports
of
the
guns
seemed
to
proceed
nothing
could
we
see
however
but
the
frowning
rocks
and
cliffs
and
the
waves
beating
restlessly
at
their
base
cape
was
reached
and
we
began
to
round
the
bluff
old
point
in
a
moment
all
our
doubts
were
dispelled
and
joy
and
gratitude
to
the
great
giver
of
all
good
filled
our
hearts
there
in
the
little
sheltered
cove
beyond
the
cape
her
sails
furled
and
anchor
dropped
lay
a
brig
of
war
with
the
english
colors
at
her
with
the
glass
i
could
discern
figures
upon
the
deck
and
upon
the
shore
beyond
several
tents
pitched
under
the
shelter
of
the
trees
and
the
smoke
of
fires
rising
among
them
as
i
handed
the
glass
to
fritz
i
felt
a
sudden
misgiving
what
said
i
to
myself
can
this
english
vessel
be
doing
thus
far
from
the
usual
track
of
ships
and
i
called
to
mind
tales
of
mutinous
crews
who
have
risen
against
their
officers
have
chosen
some
such
sheltered
retreat
as
this
have
disguised
the
vessel
and
then
sailed
forth
to
rob
and
plunder
upon
the
high
seas
fritz
then
exclaimed
i
can
see
the
captain
father
he
is
speaking
to
one
of
the
officers
and
i
can
see
his
face
quite
well
he
is
english
i
am
certain
he
is
english
and
the
flag
speaks
the
truth
and
he
put
the
glass
again
in
my
hand
that
i
might
see
for
myself
still
keeping
under
the
shelter
of
the
cliff
i
carefully
surveyed
the
vessel
there
was
no
doubt
that
fritz
was
right
and
my
fears
were
once
more
dispelled
all
was
neatness
and
regularity
on
board
the
spotless
decks
the
burnished
steel
and
brass
and
the
air
of
perfect
order
which
pervaded
both
ship
and
camp
betokened
that
authority
and
discipline
there
reigned
for
some
minutes
longer
we
continued
our
examination
of
the
scene
and
then
satisfied
by
the
appearance
of
the
camp
on
shore
that
there
was
no
chance
of
the
brig
quitting
the
coast
for
several
days
we
resolved
to
return
without
betraying
our
presence
for
i
was
unwilling
to
appear
before
these
strangers
until
we
could
do
so
in
better
form
and
in
a
manner
more
in
accordance
with
our
actual
resources
we
again
landed
at
rockburg
where
our
family
awaited
our
arrival
in
eager
expectation
and
as
fully
as
possible
we
told
them
of
all
we
had
seen
they
thoroughly
approved
of
our
caution
and
even
jenny
whose
hopes
had
been
excited
to
the
highest
pitch
by
our
description
of
the
english
vessel
and
who
longed
to
meet
her
countrymen
once
more
agreed
to
postpone
the
visit
until
the
following
day
when
having
put
our
yacht
into
good
order
we
might
pay
our
respects
to
the
captain
not
as
poor
shipwrecked
creatures
begging
assistance
but
as
lords
and
masters
of
the
land
seeking
to
know
for
what
purpose
strangers
were
visiting
the
coast
the
rest
of
the
day
was
occupied
in
making
our
preparations
our
dainty
little
craft
was
made
to
look
her
very
best
her
decks
were
scrubbed
her
brass
guns
burnished
all
lumber
removed
and
put
ashore
and
the
flag
of
england
hoisted
to
her
peak
the
mother
overhauled
our
wardrobes
and
the
neatest
uniforms
were
put
ready
for
the
boys
and
me
for
though
neither
my
wife
nor
jenny
had
ever
dreamed
of
appearing
otherwise
than
they
would
have
done
had
they
been
at
home
among
civilized
people
in
europe
yet
we
accustomed
daily
to
rough
and
often
even
dirty
work
had
adopted
just
that
costume
which
best
suited
our
comfort
and
inclination
we
should
indeed
have
surprised
the
smart
men
had
we
appeared
in
our
great
shapeless
hats
our
linen
coats
and
trousers
our
broad
leathern
belts
and
hairy
buskins
so
we
next
day
readily
donned
the
more
becoming
costumes
at
the
break
of
that
eventful
morn
when
we
were
destined
once
more
to
set
our
eyes
upon
our
and
to
hear
news
of
the
outer
world
from
which
for
so
many
years
we
had
been
exiled
we
assembled
in
our
little
breakfast
room
the
meal
was
eaten
hurriedly
and
almost
in
silence
for
our
hearts
were
too
full
and
our
minds
too
busily
occupied
to
allow
of
any
outward
display
of
excitement
fritz
and
jack
then
slipped
quietly
out
and
presently
returned
from
the
garden
with
baskets
of
the
choicest
fruits
in
fresh
and
fragrant
profusion
and
with
these
as
presents
for
the
strangers
we
went
on
board
our
yacht
the
anchor
was
weighed
the
sails
set
and
with
the
canoe
in
tow
the
little
vessel
as
though
partaking
of
our
hopes
and
joyous
expectation
bounded
merrily
over
the
waters
of
safety
bay
gave
a
wide
berth
to
the
reef
against
whose
frowning
rocks
the
sea
still
lashed
itself
to
foam
and
kept
away
for
the
cove
where
the
english
ship
unconsciously
awaited
us
the
cape
was
reached
and
to
the
surprise
and
utter
amazement
of
the
strangers
we
rounded
the
point
and
brought
up
within
hail
every
eye
on
board
and
on
shore
was
turned
toward
us
every
glass
was
produced
and
fixed
upon
our
motions
for
of
all
the
strange
sights
which
the
gallant
crew
may
have
looked
for
such
an
anomaly
as
a
pleasure
yacht
manned
by
such
a
party
as
ours
and
cruising
upon
this
strange
and
inhospitable
shore
was
the
farthest
from
their
thoughts
fritz
and
i
stepped
into
our
boat
and
pulled
for
the
brig
in
another
minute
we
were
upon
her
deck
the
captain
with
the
simple
frankness
of
a
british
seaman
welcomed
us
cordially
and
having
led
us
into
his
cabin
begged
us
to
explain
to
what
good
fortune
he
owed
a
visit
from
residents
upon
a
coast
generally
deemed
uninhabited
or
the
abode
of
the
fiercest
savages
i
gave
him
an
outline
of
the
history
of
the
wreck
and
of
our
sojourn
upon
these
shores
and
spoke
to
him
too
of
miss
montrose
and
of
the
providential
way
in
which
we
had
been
the
means
of
rescuing
her
from
her
lonely
position
then
said
the
gallant
officer
rising
and
grasping
fritz
by
the
hand
let
me
heartily
thank
you
in
my
own
name
and
in
that
of
colonel
montrose
for
it
was
the
hope
of
finding
some
trace
of
that
brave
girl
that
led
me
to
these
shores
the
disappearance
of
the
dorcas
has
been
a
terrible
blow
to
the
colonel
and
yet
though
for
three
years
no
word
of
her
or
of
any
of
those
who
sailed
in
her
has
reached
england
he
has
never
entirely
abandoned
all
hope
of
again
hearing
of
his
daughter
i
knew
this
and
a
few
weeks
ago
when
i
was
about
to
leave
sydney
for
the
cape
i
found
three
men
who
declared
themselves
survivors
of
the
dorcas
and
said
that
their
boat
of
four
which
left
the
wreck
was
the
only
one
which
to
their
knowledge
reached
land
in
safety
from
them
i
learned
all
particulars
and
applying
for
permission
to
cruise
in
these
latitudes
i
sailed
in
hopes
of
finding
further
traces
of
the
unfortunate
crew
my
efforts
have
been
rewarded
by
success
fritz
replied
most
modestly
to
the
praises
which
he
received
and
then
the
captain
begged
to
be
introduced
to
my
wife
and
miss
montrose
and
he
continued
if
it
be
not
contrary
to
your
rules
of
discipline
for
the
whole
ship
company
to
be
absent
at
once
i
will
now
send
a
boat
for
the
remainder
of
your
party
one
of
the
officers
was
accordingly
dispatched
to
the
yacht
with
a
polite
message
and
the
mother
jenny
and
the
boys
were
presently
on
board
our
kind
host
greeted
them
most
warmly
and
he
and
his
officers
vied
with
one
another
in
doing
us
honor
they
proved
indeed
most
pleasant
entertainers
and
the
time
passed
rapidly
away
at
luncheon
the
captain
told
us
that
there
had
sailed
with
him
from
sydney
an
invalid
gentleman
wolston
his
wife
and
two
daughters
but
that
though
the
sea
voyage
had
been
recommended
on
account
of
his
health
yet
it
had
not
done
wolston
so
much
good
as
had
been
anticipated
and
he
had
suffered
so
greatly
from
the
effects
of
the
storm
which
had
driven
the
unicorn
into
the
bay
for
repairs
that
he
had
been
eager
to
rest
for
a
short
time
on
land
we
were
anxious
to
meet
the
family
and
in
the
afternoon
it
was
decided
that
we
should
pay
them
a
visit
tents
had
been
pitched
for
their
accommodation
under
the
shady
trees
and
when
we
landed
we
found
wolston
seated
by
one
of
them
enjoying
the
cool
sea
breeze
he
and
his
family
were
delighted
to
see
us
and
so
much
did
we
enjoy
their
society
that
evening
found
us
still
upon
the
shore
it
was
too
late
then
to
return
to
rockburg
and
the
captain
kindly
offered
tents
for
the
accommodation
of
those
who
would
not
find
room
in
the
yacht
the
boys
spent
the
night
on
land
that
night
i
had
a
long
and
serious
consultation
with
my
wife
as
to
whether
or
not
we
really
had
any
well
grounded
reason
for
wishing
to
return
to
europe
it
would
be
childish
to
undertake
a
voyage
thither
simply
because
an
opportunity
offered
for
doing
so
neither
knew
to
what
decision
the
feelings
of
the
other
inclined
each
was
afraid
of
expressing
what
might
run
counter
to
those
feelings
but
gradually
it
began
to
appear
that
neither
entertained
any
strong
wish
to
leave
the
peaceful
island
and
finally
we
discovered
that
the
real
wish
which
lay
at
the
bottom
of
both
our
hearts
was
to
adopt
new
switzerland
as
thenceforward
our
home
what
can
be
more
delightful
than
to
find
harmony
of
opinion
in
those
we
love
when
a
great
and
momentous
decision
has
to
be
taken
my
dear
wife
assured
me
that
she
desired
nothing
more
earnestly
than
to
spend
the
rest
of
her
days
in
a
place
to
which
she
had
become
so
much
attached
provided
i
and
at
least
two
of
her
sons
also
wished
to
remain
from
the
other
two
she
would
willingly
part
if
they
chose
to
return
to
europe
with
the
understanding
that
they
must
endeavor
to
send
out
emigrants
of
a
good
class
to
join
us
and
form
a
prosperous
colony
adding
that
she
thought
the
island
ought
to
continue
to
bear
the
name
of
our
native
country
even
if
inhabited
in
future
time
by
colonists
from
england
as
well
as
from
switzerland
i
heartily
approved
of
this
excellent
idea
and
we
agreed
to
mention
it
while
consulting
with
captain
littlestone
on
the
subject
of
placing
the
island
under
the
protection
of
great
britain
then
came
the
question
as
to
which
of
our
sons
were
best
suited
to
remain
with
us
and
which
to
go
away
this
point
we
left
undecided
thinking
that
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
they
would
probably
make
a
choice
of
their
own
accord
which
they
did
even
sooner
than
we
anticipated
after
breakfast
it
was
proposed
that
captain
littlestone
should
bring
his
ship
round
to
safety
bay
that
we
might
receive
a
visit
from
him
and
his
party
at
rockburg
where
we
invited
the
invalid
wolston
and
his
family
in
hopes
that
his
health
might
benefit
by
a
comfortable
residence
on
shore
no
sooner
was
this
plan
adopted
than
fritz
and
jack
hurried
off
in
the
canoe
to
prepare
for
their
reception
being
followed
in
more
leisurely
style
by
the
brig
and
our
yacht
but
what
words
can
express
the
amazement
of
our
guests
when
rounding
the
rocky
cape
at
the
entrance
safety
bay
the
beautiful
domain
of
rockburg
lay
before
them
still
greater
was
their
astonishment
as
a
salute
of
eleven
guns
boomed
from
the
battery
on
shark
island
where
the
royal
standard
of
england
was
displayed
and
floated
majestically
on
the
morning
breeze
a
glow
of
surprise
and
pleasure
beamed
on
every
countenance
and
poor
wolston
spirits
appeared
to
revive
with
the
very
idea
of
peace
and
happiness
to
be
enjoyed
in
such
a
home
he
was
carried
on
shore
with
the
utmost
care
and
tenderness
and
comfortably
established
in
my
room
a
for
wolston
being
added
to
the
furniture
there
that
she
might
be
able
conveniently
to
attend
on
her
husband
meantime
the
scene
at
the
harbor
and
all
round
rockburg
was
of
the
liveliest
description
merriment
and
excitement
prevailed
in
all
directions
as
the
beauties
and
wonders
of
our
residence
were
explored
so
that
a
summons
to
dinner
scarcely
attracted
notice
however
as
a
visit
to
falconhurst
was
projected
the
company
was
at
length
induced
to
be
seated
and
to
partake
of
our
good
cheer
but
the
spirit
of
restlessness
soon
returned
and
the
young
people
kept
roaming
about
through
our
hitherto
quiet
lawns
avenues
and
shrubberies
until
i
was
ready
to
believe
their
number
three
times
what
it
actually
was
toward
evening
the
excitement
began
to
abate
and
the
party
assembled
for
supper
with
tolerable
composure
wolston
was
able
to
join
us
as
the
rest
he
had
enjoyed
and
the
pleasure
inspired
by
the
hope
of
a
residence
among
us
seemed
to
have
given
him
new
life
this
wish
he
now
distinctly
expressed
in
his
own
name
and
in
that
of
his
wife
inquiring
what
our
intentions
were
and
proposing
if
agreeable
to
us
that
they
with
their
eldest
daughter
whose
health
like
his
own
was
delicate
should
make
a
long
stay
on
the
island
while
the
younger
daughter
went
for
the
present
to
her
brother
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
in
the
event
of
his
ultimately
deciding
to
settle
altogether
among
us
wolston
would
propose
that
his
son
should
leave
the
cape
and
join
our
colony
with
sincere
satisfaction
i
welcomed
this
proposal
saying
that
it
was
my
wish
and
that
of
my
wife
to
remain
for
the
rest
of
our
days
in
new
switzerland
hurrah
for
new
switzerland
new
switzerland
forever
shouted
the
whole
company
enthusiastically
as
they
raised
their
glasses
and
made
them
touch
with
a
musical
ring
which
so
expressively
denotes
a
joyful
unanimity
of
sentiment
prosperity
to
new
switzerland
long
may
she
flourish
echoed
on
all
sides
long
life
and
happiness
to
those
who
make
new
switzerland
their
home
added
ernest
to
my
great
surprise
leaning
forward
as
he
spoke
to
ring
his
glass
with
mine
his
mother
and
wolston
wo
somebody
wish
long
life
and
prosperity
to
those
who
go
away
inquired
jenny
with
a
pretty
arch
look
much
as
i
long
to
return
to
england
and
my
father
my
inclination
will
waver
if
all
the
cheers
are
for
new
switzerland
three
cheers
for
england
and
colonel
montrose
cried
fritz
success
and
happiness
to
us
who
return
to
europe
and
while
the
vaulted
roofs
rang
with
the
cheering
elicited
by
this
toast
a
glance
from
jenny
showed
him
how
much
she
thanked
him
for
appreciating
her
wish
to
return
to
her
father
notwithstanding
her
attachment
to
our
family
well
said
i
when
silence
was
restored
since
fritz
resolves
to
go
to
england
he
must
undertake
for
me
the
duty
of
bringing
happiness
to
a
mourning
father
by
restoring
to
him
this
dear
daughter
whom
i
have
been
ready
to
regard
as
my
own
by
right
of
her
being
cast
on
the
shores
of
my
island
ernest
chooses
to
remain
with
me
his
mother
and
i
rejoice
heartily
in
this
decision
and
promise
him
all
the
highest
scientific
appointments
in
our
power
to
bestow
and
now
what
is
jack
choice
the
only
talent
i
can
say
he
possesses
is
that
of
a
comic
actor
and
to
shine
on
the
stage
he
must
needs
go
to
europe
jack
is
not
going
to
europe
however
was
his
reply
he
means
to
stay
here
and
when
fritz
is
gone
he
will
be
the
best
rider
and
the
best
shot
in
new
switzerland
which
is
the
summit
of
his
ambition
the
fact
is
he
continued
laughing
i
rather
stand
in
awe
of
their
european
schools
and
should
expect
to
find
myself
caught
and
clapped
into
one
if
i
ventured
too
near
them
a
good
school
is
exactly
what
i
want
said
franz
among
a
number
of
students
there
is
some
emulation
and
enthusiasm
and
i
shall
have
a
chance
of
rising
in
the
world
fritz
will
probably
return
here
some
day
but
it
might
be
well
for
one
member
of
the
family
to
go
home
with
the
intention
of
remaining
there
altogether
and
as
i
am
the
youngest
i
could
more
easily
than
the
rest
adapt
myself
to
a
different
life
my
father
however
will
decide
for
me
you
may
go
my
dear
son
i
replied
and
god
bless
all
our
plans
and
resolutions
the
whole
earth
is
the
lord
and
where
as
in
his
sight
you
lead
good
and
useful
lives
there
is
your
home
and
now
that
i
know
your
wishes
the
only
question
is
whether
captain
littlestone
will
kindly
enable
you
to
carry
them
out
all
eyes
were
fixed
eagerly
upon
him
and
after
a
moment
pause
the
gallant
officer
spoke
as
follows
i
think
my
way
in
this
matter
is
perfectly
clear
and
i
consider
that
i
have
been
providentially
guided
to
be
the
means
of
once
more
placing
this
family
in
communication
with
their
friends
and
with
the
civilized
world
my
orders
were
to
search
for
a
shipwrecked
crew
survivors
from
two
wrecks
have
been
discovered
three
passengers
express
a
wish
to
leave
my
ship
here
instead
of
at
the
cape
while
at
the
same
time
i
am
requested
to
give
to
three
persons
a
passage
to
england
could
anything
suit
better
i
am
most
willing
to
undertake
the
charge
of
those
who
may
be
committed
to
my
care
every
circumstance
has
been
wonderfully
ordered
and
linked
together
by
divine
providence
and
if
england
gains
a
prosperous
and
happy
colony
it
will
prove
a
fitting
clasp
to
this
fortunate
chain
of
events
three
cheers
for
new
switzerland
deep
emotion
stirred
every
heart
as
the
party
separated
for
the
night
many
felt
that
they
were
suddenly
standing
on
the
threshold
of
a
new
life
while
for
myself
a
weight
was
rolled
from
my
heart
and
i
thanked
god
that
a
difficulty
was
solved
which
for
years
had
oppressed
me
with
anxiety
after
this
nothing
was
thought
of
but
making
preparations
for
the
departure
of
the
dear
ones
bound
for
england
captain
littlestone
allowed
as
much
time
as
he
could
spare
but
it
was
necessarily
short
so
that
incessant
movement
and
industry
pervaded
the
settlement
for
several
days
everything
was
provided
and
packed
up
that
could
in
any
way
add
to
our
children
comfort
on
the
voyage
or
benefit
them
after
their
arrival
in
england
and
a
large
share
of
my
possessions
in
pearls
corals
furs
spices
and
other
valuables
would
enable
them
to
take
a
good
position
in
the
world
of
commerce
i
committed
to
their
care
private
papers
money
and
jewels
which
i
knew
to
have
been
the
personal
property
of
the
captain
of
our
ship
desiring
them
to
hand
them
over
if
possible
to
his
heirs
a
short
account
of
the
wreck
with
the
names
of
the
crew
a
list
of
which
i
had
found
was
given
to
captain
littlestone
fritz
having
previously
made
known
to
me
what
indeed
was
very
evident
the
attachment
between
himself
and
jenny
i
advised
him
to
mention
it
to
colonel
montrose
as
soon
as
possible
after
being
introduced
to
him
and
ask
for
his
sanction
to
their
engagement
i
on
my
part
gladly
bestowing
mine
as
did
his
mother
who
loved
the
sweet
girl
dearly
and
heartily
grieved
to
part
with
her
on
the
evening
before
our
separation
i
gave
to
fritz
the
journal
in
which
ever
since
the
shipwreck
i
had
chronicled
the
events
of
our
life
desiring
that
the
story
might
be
printed
and
published
it
was
written
as
you
well
know
said
i
for
the
instruction
and
amusement
of
my
children
but
it
is
very
possible
that
it
may
be
useful
to
other
young
people
more
especially
to
boys
children
are
on
the
whole
very
much
alike
everywhere
and
you
four
lads
fairly
represent
multitudes
who
are
growing
up
in
all
directions
it
will
make
me
happy
to
think
that
my
simple
narrative
may
lead
some
of
these
to
observe
how
blessed
are
the
results
of
patient
continuance
in
what
benefits
arise
from
the
thoughtful
application
of
knowledge
and
science
and
how
good
and
pleasant
a
thing
it
is
when
brethren
dwell
together
in
unity
under
the
eye
of
parental
love
night
has
closed
around
me
for
the
last
time
my
united
family
slumbers
beneath
my
care
this
closing
chapter
of
my
journal
will
pass
into
the
hands
of
my
eldest
son
from
afar
i
greet
thee
europe
i
greet
thee
dear
old
switzerland
like
thee
may
new
switzerland
flourish
and
prosper
good
happy
and
free
