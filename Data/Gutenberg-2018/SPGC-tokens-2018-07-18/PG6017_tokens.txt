appear
the
trail
to
kalvik
leads
down
from
the
northward
mountains
over
the
tundra
which
flanks
the
tide
flats
then
creeps
out
upon
the
salt
ice
of
the
river
and
across
to
the
village
it
boasts
no
travel
in
summer
but
by
winter
an
occasional
traveller
may
be
seen
issuing
forth
from
the
great
country
beyond
bound
for
the
open
water
while
once
in
thirty
days
the
whirls
out
of
the
forest
to
the
south
pauses
one
night
to
leave
word
of
the
world
and
then
is
swallowed
up
in
the
silent
hills
kalvik
to
be
sure
is
not
much
of
a
place
being
hidden
away
from
the
routes
to
the
interior
and
wholly
unknown
except
to
those
interested
in
the
fisheries
a
greek
church
a
russian
school
with
a
cassocked
priest
presiding
and
about
a
hundred
houses
beside
the
cannery
buildings
make
up
the
village
at
first
glance
these
canneries
might
convey
the
impression
of
a
considerable
city
for
there
are
ten
plants
in
all
scattered
along
several
miles
of
the
but
in
winter
they
stand
empty
and
still
their
great
roofs
drummed
upon
by
the
fierce
arctic
storms
their
high
stacks
pointing
skyward
like
long
frozen
fingers
black
with
frost
there
are
the
natives
of
course
but
they
do
not
count
concealed
as
they
are
in
burrows
no
one
knows
their
number
not
even
the
priest
who
gathers
toll
from
them
early
one
december
afternoon
there
entered
upon
this
trail
from
the
timberless
hills
far
away
to
the
northward
a
weary
team
of
six
dogs
driven
by
two
men
it
had
been
snowing
since
dawn
and
the
dim
were
hidden
beneath
a
fluff
which
rendered
progress
difficult
and
called
the
whip
into
cruel
service
a
gray
smother
sifted
down
sluggishly
shutting
out
hill
and
horizon
blending
sky
and
landscape
into
a
blurred
monotone
playing
strange
pranks
with
the
eye
that
grew
tired
trying
to
pierce
it
the
travellers
had
been
plodding
sullenly
hour
after
hour
dispirited
by
the
weight
of
the
storm
which
bore
them
down
like
some
impalpable
resistless
burden
there
was
no
reality
in
earth
air
or
sky
their
vision
was
rested
by
no
spot
of
color
save
themselves
apparently
swimming
through
an
endless
formless
atmosphere
of
gray
fingerless
fraser
broke
trail
but
to
boyd
emerson
who
drove
he
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
dancing
doll
bobbing
and
swaying
grotesquely
as
if
suspended
by
invisible
wires
at
times
it
seemed
to
the
whimsical
fancy
as
if
each
of
them
trod
a
measure
in
the
centre
of
a
colorless
universe
something
after
the
fashion
of
goldfish
floating
in
a
globe
fraser
pulled
up
without
warning
and
instantly
the
dogs
stopped
straightway
beginning
to
soothe
their
pads
and
to
strip
the
from
between
their
toes
but
the
wheelers
were
too
tired
to
make
the
effort
so
emerson
went
forward
and
performed
the
task
for
them
while
fraser
floundered
back
and
sank
to
a
sitting
posture
on
the
sled
whew
he
exclaimed
this
is
sure
tough
if
i
do
see
a
tree
or
something
with
enough
color
to
bust
this
monotony
i
go
dotty
another
day
like
this
and
we
both
be
observed
emerson
grimly
as
he
bent
to
his
task
but
it
ca
be
far
to
the
river
now
this
fall
has
covered
the
trail
till
i
have
to
feel
it
out
with
my
feet
grumbled
fraser
when
i
step
off
to
one
side
i
go
in
up
to
my
hips
it
like
walking
a
plank
a
foot
deep
in
feathers
and
i
feel
like
i
was
a
mile
above
the
earth
in
a
heavy
fog
after
a
moment
he
continued
speaking
of
feathers
how
you
like
to
have
a
fried
chicken
maryland
shut
up
said
the
man
at
the
dogs
crossly
well
it
do
do
any
harm
to
think
about
it
growled
fraser
he
felt
out
a
pipe
from
his
pocket
and
endeavored
unsuccessfully
to
blow
through
it
then
complained
the
damn
thing
is
froze
it
seems
like
a
man
ca
practice
no
vices
whatever
in
this
country
i
glad
i
getting
out
of
it
so
am
i
agreed
the
younger
man
having
completed
his
task
he
came
back
to
the
sled
and
seated
himself
beside
the
other
as
i
was
saying
a
mile
back
yonder
fraser
resumed
whatever
made
you
snatch
me
away
from
them
minions
of
the
law
i
know
you
says
it
for
company
to
be
sure
but
we
visit
with
one
another
about
like
two
why
did
you
do
it
bo
well
you
talk
enough
for
both
of
us
yes
but
that
ai
no
reason
why
you
should
lay
yourself
liable
to
the
you
ai
the
kind
to
take
a
chance
just
because
you
lonesome
i
picked
you
up
because
of
your
morals
i
dare
say
i
was
tired
of
myself
and
you
interested
me
besides
emerson
added
reflectively
i
have
no
particular
cause
to
love
the
law
either
that
how
i
sized
it
said
fraser
wagging
his
head
with
animation
i
knew
you
had
some
kind
of
a
what
was
it
this
is
low
down
see
and
confidential
as
between
two
crooks
i
never
snitch
hold
on
there
i
not
a
crook
i
not
sufficiently
ingenious
to
be
a
member
of
your
honorable
profession
well
i
guess
my
profession
is
as
honorable
as
most
i
tried
all
of
them
and
they
all
alike
it
simply
a
question
of
how
the
other
fellow
will
separate
easiest
he
stopped
and
tightened
his
thong
then
rising
gazed
curiously
at
the
listless
countenance
of
his
travelling
companion
feeling
anew
the
curiosity
that
had
fretted
him
for
the
past
three
weeks
finally
he
observed
with
a
trace
of
impatience
well
if
you
ai
one
of
us
you
ought
to
be
you
got
the
best
poker
face
i
ever
see
it
as
blind
as
a
plastered
wall
you
ai
had
a
real
expression
on
it
since
you
hauled
me
off
that
in
norton
sound
he
swung
ahead
of
the
dogs
they
rose
reluctantly
and
with
a
crack
of
the
whip
the
little
caravan
crawled
noiselessly
into
the
gray
twilight
an
hour
later
they
dropped
from
the
plain
down
through
a
gully
to
the
river
where
they
found
a
trail
beneath
its
downy
covering
a
cold
breath
sucked
up
from
the
sea
ahead
they
saw
the
ragged
ice
by
the
tide
but
their
course
was
well
marked
now
so
they
swung
themselves
upon
the
sled
while
the
dogs
shook
off
their
lethargy
and
broke
into
their
pattering
tireless
at
length
they
came
to
a
point
where
the
trail
divided
one
branch
leading
off
at
right
angles
from
the
shore
and
penetrating
the
hummocks
that
marked
the
tide
limit
evidently
it
led
to
the
village
which
they
knew
lay
somewhere
on
the
farther
side
hidden
by
a
mile
or
more
of
sifting
snow
so
they
altered
their
course
and
bore
out
upon
the
river
the
going
here
was
so
rough
that
both
men
leaped
from
their
seats
and
ran
beside
the
sled
one
at
the
front
the
other
guiding
it
from
the
rear
up
and
down
over
the
ridges
the
trail
led
winding
through
the
frozen
inequalities
the
dogs
never
breaking
their
tireless
trot
they
mounted
a
swelling
ridge
and
rushed
down
to
the
level
river
ice
beyond
but
as
they
did
so
they
felt
their
footing
sag
beneath
them
heard
a
shivering
creak
on
every
side
and
before
they
could
do
more
than
cry
out
warningly
saw
water
rising
about
the
the
momentum
of
the
heavy
sledge
together
with
the
speed
of
the
racing
dogs
forced
them
out
upon
the
treacherous
ice
before
they
could
check
their
speed
emerson
shouted
the
dogs
leaped
but
with
a
crash
the
ice
gave
way
and
for
a
moment
the
water
closed
over
him
clinging
to
the
sled
to
save
himself
his
weight
slowed
it
down
and
the
dogs
stopped
fingerless
fraser
broke
through
in
turn
gasping
as
the
icy
water
rose
to
his
armpits
slowly
at
first
the
sled
sank
till
it
floated
half
submerged
and
this
spot
which
a
moment
before
had
seemed
so
safe
and
solid
became
now
a
churning
tangle
of
broken
fragments
men
and
dogs
struggling
in
a
liquid
that
seemed
dark
as
syrup
contrasted
with
the
surrounding
whiteness
the
lead
animals
under
whose
feet
the
ice
was
still
firm
turned
inquiringly
then
settled
on
their
haunches
with
lolling
tongues
the
pair
next
ahead
of
the
sledge
paddled
frantically
straining
to
reach
the
solid
sheet
beyond
but
were
held
back
by
their
harness
emerson
used
the
sled
for
a
footing
and
endeavored
to
gain
the
ice
at
one
side
but
it
broke
beneath
him
and
he
lunged
in
up
to
his
shoulders
again
he
tried
but
again
the
ice
broke
under
his
hand
more
easily
now
fraser
struggled
to
get
out
in
the
opposite
direction
each
man
aiming
to
secure
an
independent
footing
but
their
efforts
only
enlarged
the
pool
the
chill
went
through
them
like
thin
blades
and
they
chattered
gaspingly
fighting
with
desperation
while
the
wheel
dogs
involved
in
the
harness
began
to
whine
and
cough
at
which
emerson
shouted
cut
the
team
loose
quick
but
the
other
spat
out
a
mouthful
of
salt
water
and
spluttered
i
i
ca
swim
whereupon
the
first
speaker
half
swam
half
dragged
himself
through
the
slush
and
broken
debris
to
the
forward
end
of
the
sled
and
seeking
out
the
from
beneath
his
parka
cut
the
harness
of
the
two
distressed
animals
once
free
they
scrambled
to
safety
shook
themselves
and
rolled
in
the
dry
snow
emerson
next
attempted
to
lift
the
nose
of
the
sled
up
on
the
ice
shouting
at
the
remainder
of
the
team
to
pull
but
they
only
wagged
their
tails
and
whined
excitedly
at
this
unusual
form
of
entertainment
each
time
he
tried
to
lift
the
sled
he
crashed
through
fresh
ice
finally
bearing
the
next
pair
of
dogs
with
him
and
then
the
two
animals
in
the
lead
all
of
them
became
hopelessly
entangled
he
could
have
won
his
way
back
to
the
permanent
ice
as
fraser
was
doing
but
there
was
no
way
of
getting
his
team
there
and
he
would
not
sacrifice
those
dumb
brutes
now
growing
frantic
one
of
them
pawed
the
from
his
hand
he
had
become
almost
numb
with
cold
and
despair
when
he
heard
the
jingle
of
many
small
bells
and
a
sharp
command
uttered
in
a
new
voice
out
of
the
snow
fog
from
the
direction
in
which
they
were
headed
broke
a
team
running
full
and
free
at
a
word
they
veered
to
the
right
and
came
to
a
pause
avoiding
the
even
from
his
hasty
glance
emerson
marvelled
at
the
outfit
having
never
seen
the
like
in
all
his
travels
through
the
north
for
each
animal
of
the
twelve
stood
to
a
tall
man
and
they
were
like
wolves
of
one
pack
gray
and
gaunt
and
wicked
the
behind
them
was
long
and
light
and
of
a
design
that
was
new
to
him
while
the
furs
in
it
were
of
white
fox
the
figure
wrapped
up
in
them
spoke
again
sharply
whereupon
a
tall
indian
runner
left
the
team
and
headed
swiftly
for
the
scene
of
the
accident
as
he
approached
emerson
noted
the
fellow
flowing
parka
of
skins
from
which
a
score
of
fluffy
tails
fell
free
and
he
saw
that
this
was
no
indian
but
a
of
peculiar
coppery
lightness
the
man
ran
forward
till
he
neared
the
edge
of
the
opening
where
the
tide
had
caused
the
floes
to
separate
and
the
cold
had
not
had
time
as
yet
to
heal
it
then
flattening
his
body
to
its
full
length
on
the
ice
he
crawled
out
cautiously
and
seized
the
lead
dog
carefully
he
wormed
his
way
backward
to
security
then
leaned
his
weight
upon
the
tugline
it
had
been
a
ticklish
operation
requiring
nice
skill
and
dexterity
but
now
that
his
footing
was
sure
the
runner
exerted
his
whole
strength
and
as
the
dogs
scratched
and
tore
for
firm
foothold
the
sled
came
crunching
closer
and
closer
through
the
skin
of
ice
then
he
reached
down
and
dragged
emerson
out
dripping
and
nerveless
from
his
immersion
together
they
rescued
the
outfit
the
person
in
the
sledge
had
watched
them
silently
but
now
spoke
in
a
strange
patois
and
the
breed
gave
voice
to
her
words
for
it
was
a
woman
one
mile
you
go
white
man
house
go
quick
you
freeze
he
pointed
back
whence
the
two
men
had
come
indicating
the
other
branch
of
the
trail
fraser
had
emerged
meanwhile
and
circled
the
but
even
this
brief
exposure
to
the
open
air
had
served
to
harden
his
wet
garments
into
a
crackling
armor
with
rattling
teeth
he
asked
ai
you
got
no
dry
clothes
our
stuff
is
soaked
again
the
indian
translated
some
words
from
the
girl
no
you
hurry
and
no
stop
here
we
go
quick
over
yonder
no
can
stop
at
all
he
hurried
back
to
his
mistress
cried
once
to
the
pack
of
gray
dogs
oonah
and
they
were
off
as
if
in
chase
they
left
the
trail
and
circled
toward
the
shore
the
driver
standing
erect
upon
the
heels
of
the
runners
guiding
his
team
with
gestures
and
sharp
cries
the
rush
of
air
fluttering
the
many
of
his
parka
like
fairy
streamers
as
they
dashed
past
both
white
men
had
one
fleeting
glimpse
of
a
woman
face
beneath
a
furred
hood
and
then
it
was
gone
for
a
moment
they
stood
and
stared
after
the
team
while
the
breath
of
the
arctic
sea
stiffened
their
garments
and
froze
their
to
the
ice
did
you
see
fraser
ejaculated
good
lord
it
a
a
woman
emerson
stirred
himself
nonsense
she
must
be
a
breed
said
he
breeds
do
have
yellow
hair
declared
the
other
swiftly
they
bent
in
the
free
dogs
and
lashed
the
team
to
a
run
they
felt
the
chill
of
death
in
their
bones
and
instead
of
riding
they
ran
with
the
sled
till
their
blood
beat
painfully
their
outer
coverings
were
like
shells
their
underclothes
were
soaked
and
although
their
going
was
difficult
and
clumsy
they
dared
not
stop
for
this
is
the
extremest
peril
of
the
north
ten
minutes
later
they
swung
over
the
and
into
the
midst
of
great
rambling
frame
buildings
seen
dimly
through
the
falling
snow
their
trail
led
them
to
a
cabin
from
the
stovepipe
of
which
they
saw
pouring
the
dogs
broke
into
cry
and
were
answered
by
many
others
conjured
from
their
both
men
were
greatly
distressed
by
now
and
could
handle
themselves
only
with
difficulty
another
mile
would
have
meant
disaster
rout
out
the
owner
and
tell
him
we
wet
said
emerson
i
free
the
dogs
as
fraser
disappeared
the
young
man
ran
forward
to
slip
the
harness
from
his
animals
but
found
it
frozen
into
their
fur
the
knots
and
buckles
transformed
into
unmanageable
lumps
of
ice
so
he
wrenched
the
camp
axe
from
the
sled
and
cut
the
thongs
then
hacked
loose
the
stiff
seized
the
sodden
and
made
for
the
house
a
traveller
first
concern
is
for
his
dogs
then
for
his
bedding
before
he
could
reach
the
cabin
the
door
opened
and
fraser
appeared
a
strange
dazed
look
on
his
face
he
was
followed
by
a
large
man
of
coarse
and
sullen
countenance
who
paused
on
the
threshold
do
bother
with
the
rest
of
the
stuff
emerson
chattered
it
no
use
fraser
replied
we
ca
go
in
the
former
paused
forgetting
the
cold
in
his
amazement
what
wrong
somebody
sick
i
do
know
what
the
matter
this
man
just
says
that
all
the
fellow
evidently
a
watchman
nodded
his
head
and
growled
yaas
ay
got
no
room
but
you
do
understand
said
emerson
we
wet
we
broke
through
the
ice
never
mind
the
room
we
get
along
somehow
he
advanced
with
the
under
his
arm
but
the
man
stood
immovable
blocking
the
entrance
you
ca
come
in
har
you
find
anoder
house
mile
furder
the
traveller
however
paid
no
heed
to
these
words
but
pushed
forward
shifting
the
bundle
to
his
shoulder
and
holding
it
so
that
it
was
thrust
into
the
swede
face
involuntarily
the
watchman
drew
back
whereupon
the
unwelcome
visitor
crowded
past
jostling
his
inhospitable
host
roughly
laughing
the
while
although
in
his
laughter
there
rang
a
dangerous
metallic
note
emerson
quick
action
gained
him
entrance
and
fraser
followed
behind
into
the
where
a
squaw
withdrew
before
them
the
young
man
flung
down
his
burden
and
addressed
her
peremptorily
punch
up
that
fire
and
get
us
something
to
eat
quick
turning
to
the
owner
of
the
house
who
lumbered
in
after
them
he
disregarded
the
fellow
scowl
and
said
why
you
got
lots
of
room
old
man
we
pay
our
way
now
get
some
more
firewood
will
you
i
chilled
to
the
bone
that
a
good
fellow
his
forceful
heartiness
forbade
dispute
and
the
man
obeyed
sourly
the
two
stripped
off
their
outer
clothing
and
in
a
trice
the
small
room
became
littered
and
hung
with
steaming
garments
they
took
possession
of
the
house
and
ordered
the
swede
and
his
squaw
about
with
firm
good
nature
until
the
couple
slunk
into
an
inner
room
and
began
to
talk
in
low
tones
fraser
had
been
watching
the
fellow
and
now
remarked
to
his
companion
say
what
ails
that
ginney
the
assumption
of
fell
away
from
boyd
emerson
as
he
replied
i
never
knew
anybody
to
refuse
shelter
to
freezing
men
before
something
back
of
this
he
got
some
reason
for
his
refusal
i
want
any
trouble
but
the
inner
door
opened
and
the
watchman
reappeared
evidently
his
sluggish
resolution
had
finally
set
itself
you
ca
stop
har
he
said
ay
got
orders
emerson
was
at
the
fire
busy
rubbing
the
cramps
from
his
arms
and
did
not
answer
when
fraser
likewise
ignored
the
swede
he
repeated
his
command
louder
this
time
get
out
of
may
house
quick
both
men
kept
their
backs
turned
and
continued
to
ignore
him
at
which
the
fellow
advanced
heavily
and
threatened
them
in
a
big
raucous
voice
trembling
with
rage
by
yingo
ay
trow
you
out
he
stooped
and
gathered
up
the
garments
nearest
him
then
stepped
toward
the
outer
door
but
before
he
could
make
good
his
threat
emerson
whirled
like
a
cat
his
eyes
dark
with
sudden
fury
and
seized
his
host
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
he
jerked
him
back
so
roughly
that
the
wet
clothes
flapped
to
the
floor
in
four
directions
whereat
the
scandinavian
let
forth
a
bellow
but
emerson
struck
him
heavily
on
the
jaw
with
his
open
hand
then
hurled
him
backward
into
the
room
so
violently
that
he
reeled
and
his
legs
colliding
with
a
bench
he
fell
against
the
wall
before
he
could
recover
his
assailant
stepped
in
between
his
hands
and
throttled
him
beating
his
head
violently
against
the
logs
the
fellow
undertook
to
grapple
with
him
at
which
emerson
wrenched
himself
free
and
stepping
back
spoke
in
a
quivering
voice
which
fraser
had
never
heard
before
i
just
playing
with
you
now
i
do
want
to
hurt
you
get
out
of
my
house
ay
got
orders
cried
the
watchman
wildly
and
made
for
him
again
it
was
evident
that
the
man
was
not
lacking
in
stupid
courage
but
emerson
driven
to
it
stepped
aside
and
swung
heavily
the
squaw
in
the
doorway
screamed
and
the
swede
fell
full
length
again
boyd
was
upon
him
the
restraint
of
the
past
long
weeks
now
unbridled
his
temper
unchecked
he
dragged
his
victim
through
the
grinding
his
face
into
the
floor
at
every
effort
to
rise
he
forced
him
to
his
own
jerked
the
door
open
and
kicked
him
out
into
the
snow
then
barred
the
entrance
and
returned
to
the
warmth
of
the
logs
his
face
convulsed
and
his
lips
working
fingerless
fraser
gazed
at
him
queerly
as
if
at
some
utterly
strange
phenomenon
then
drawled
with
a
sly
chuckle
well
well
you
bloody
gentle
i
must
say
i
did
think
it
was
in
you
when
the
other
vouchsafed
no
answer
he
took
his
pipe
from
a
pocket
of
his
steaming
mackinaw
and
filled
it
from
a
on
the
then
leaning
back
in
his
chair
he
propped
his
feet
up
on
the
table
and
sighed
luxuriously
as
he
murmured
these
scenes
of
violence
just
upset
me
something
dreadful
chapter
ii
in
which
they
break
bread
with
a
lonely
woman
it
was
perhaps
two
hours
later
that
fraser
went
to
the
window
for
the
twentieth
time
and
breathing
against
the
pane
cleared
a
announcing
he
gone
emerson
absorbed
in
a
book
made
no
answer
after
his
encounter
with
the
householder
he
had
said
little
and
upon
finding
this
coverless
volume
a
tattered
copy
of
don
quixote
he
had
relapsed
into
utter
silence
i
say
he
gone
reiterated
the
man
at
the
window
still
no
reply
was
forthcoming
and
seating
himself
near
the
stove
fraser
spread
his
hands
before
him
in
the
shape
of
a
book
and
began
whimsically
in
a
dry
monotone
as
if
reading
to
himself
at
which
startling
news
emerson
with
his
customary
vivacity
smiled
engagingly
and
answered
back
do
you
reckon
he
has
departed
mr
fraser
he
lost
his
voice
cussing
us
i
replied
graciously
no
exclaimed
the
genial
emerson
more
for
the
sake
of
conversation
than
argument
has
got
cold
feet
evidently
unwilling
to
let
the
conversation
lag
the
garrulous
emerson
continued
a
dark
night
without
and
i
fear
some
mischief
is
afoot
but
what
of
yonder
beautchous
gel
said
i
at
which
he
burst
into
wild
laughter
emerson
laid
down
his
book
what
are
you
muttering
about
he
asked
i
merely
remarked
that
our
scandalized
scandalusian
has
got
tired
of
singin
wo
you
open
that
door
and
let
me
in
and
has
ducked
where
has
he
gone
i
ai
no
maybe
he
loped
off
to
seattle
after
a
policeman
and
a
writ
of
plus
maybe
he
has
gone
after
a
clump
of
his
countrymen
this
is
for
swedes
without
answering
emerson
rose
and
going
to
the
inner
door
called
through
to
the
squaw
get
us
a
cup
of
coffee
coffee
interjected
fraser
why
not
have
a
real
feed
i
hungry
enough
to
eat
anything
except
bread
and
roquefort
cheese
no
said
the
other
i
do
want
to
cause
any
more
trouble
than
necessary
well
there
a
lot
of
grub
in
the
cache
let
load
up
the
sled
i
hardly
a
thief
oh
but
no
fingerless
fraser
fell
back
into
sour
silence
when
the
slatternly
woman
had
slunk
forth
and
was
busied
at
the
stove
emerson
observed
musingly
i
wonder
what
possessed
that
fellow
to
act
as
he
did
he
said
he
had
orders
fraser
offered
if
i
had
a
warm
cabin
a
lot
of
grub
and
a
squaw
i
like
to
see
somebody
give
orders
their
clothing
was
dry
now
and
they
proceeded
to
dress
leisurely
as
emerson
roped
up
the
fraser
suddenly
suspended
operations
on
his
attire
and
asked
querulously
what
the
matter
we
ai
goin
to
move
are
we
yes
we
make
for
one
of
the
other
canneries
answered
emerson
without
looking
up
but
i
got
sore
feet
complained
the
adventurer
what
again
emerson
laughed
skeptically
better
walk
on
your
hands
for
a
while
and
it
getting
dark
too
never
mind
it
ca
be
far
come
now
he
urged
the
fellow
as
he
had
repeatedly
urged
him
before
for
fraser
seemed
to
have
the
blood
of
a
tramp
in
his
veins
then
he
tried
to
question
the
woman
but
she
maintained
a
frightened
silence
when
they
had
finished
their
coffee
emerson
laid
two
silver
dollars
on
the
table
and
they
left
the
house
to
search
out
the
again
the
early
darkness
hastened
by
the
storm
was
upon
them
when
they
crept
up
the
opposite
bank
an
hour
later
and
through
the
gloom
beheld
a
group
of
great
shadowy
buildings
approaching
the
solitary
gleam
of
light
shining
from
the
window
of
the
watchman
house
they
applied
to
him
for
shelter
we
are
just
off
a
long
trip
and
our
dogs
are
played
out
emerson
explained
we
pay
well
for
a
place
to
rest
you
ca
stop
here
said
the
fellow
gruffly
why
not
i
got
no
room
is
there
a
near
by
i
do
know
you
better
find
out
mighty
quick
retorted
the
young
man
with
rising
temper
at
the
other
discourtesy
try
the
next
place
below
said
the
watchman
hurriedly
slamming
the
door
in
their
faces
and
bolting
it
once
secure
behind
his
barricade
he
added
if
he
wo
let
you
in
maybe
the
priest
can
take
care
of
you
at
the
mission
this
here
town
of
kalvik
is
certainly
overjoyed
at
our
arrival
said
fraser
ai
it
but
his
irate
companion
made
no
comment
whereat
sensing
the
anger
behind
his
silence
the
speaker
for
once
failed
to
extemporize
an
answer
to
his
own
remark
at
the
next
stop
they
encountered
the
same
gruff
show
of
inhospitality
and
all
they
could
elicit
from
the
proprietor
was
another
direction
in
broken
english
to
try
the
russian
priest
i
make
one
more
try
said
emerson
between
his
teeth
gratingly
as
they
swung
out
into
the
darkness
a
second
time
if
that
succeed
then
i
take
possession
again
i
wo
be
passed
on
all
night
this
way
the
will
certainly
show
us
to
the
straw
said
fingerless
fraser
the
what
the
the
oh
the
priest
but
when
a
mile
farther
on
they
drew
up
before
a
white
pile
surmounted
by
a
dimly
discerned
greek
cross
no
sign
of
life
was
to
be
seen
and
their
signals
awakened
no
response
gone
and
they
knew
it
the
vicious
manner
in
which
emerson
handled
his
whip
as
he
said
the
words
betrayed
his
state
of
mind
three
weeks
of
unvarying
hardship
and
toilsome
travel
had
worn
out
both
men
and
rendered
them
desperate
hence
they
wasted
no
words
when
for
the
fourth
time
their
eyes
caught
the
welcome
sight
of
a
shining
radiance
in
the
gloom
of
the
gathering
night
the
team
stopped
of
its
own
accord
unhitch
ordered
emerson
doggedly
as
he
began
to
untie
the
ropes
of
the
sled
he
shouldered
the
and
made
toward
the
light
that
filtered
through
the
crusted
windows
followed
by
fraser
similarly
burdened
but
as
they
approached
they
saw
at
once
that
this
was
no
cannery
it
looked
more
like
a
or
for
the
structure
was
low
and
it
was
built
of
logs
behind
and
connected
with
it
by
a
covered
hall
or
passageway
crouched
another
squat
building
of
the
same
character
its
roof
piled
thick
with
a
mass
of
snow
its
windows
glowing
those
warm
squares
of
light
set
into
the
black
walls
and
overhung
by
eaves
gave
the
place
the
appearance
of
a
it
was
so
snug
and
cozy
even
the
glitter
was
there
caused
by
the
rays
refracted
from
the
facets
of
the
myriad
they
mounted
the
steps
of
the
nigh
building
and
without
knocking
flung
the
door
open
entered
then
tossed
their
bundles
to
the
floor
with
a
sharp
exclamation
at
this
unceremonious
intrusion
an
indian
woman
whom
they
had
surprised
dropped
her
task
and
regarded
them
we
all
right
this
time
observed
emerson
as
he
swept
the
place
with
his
eyes
it
a
store
then
to
the
woman
he
said
briefly
we
want
a
bed
and
something
to
eat
on
every
side
the
walls
were
shelved
with
merchandise
while
the
counter
carried
a
supply
of
clothing
skins
and
what
not
a
cylindrical
stove
in
the
centre
of
the
room
emanated
a
hot
red
glow
this
looks
like
the
waldorf
to
me
said
fingerless
fraser
starting
to
remove
his
parka
the
fox
fringe
on
the
hood
of
which
was
white
from
his
breath
what
you
want
demanded
the
squaw
coming
forward
boyd
likewise
divesting
himself
of
his
furs
noticed
that
she
was
little
more
than
a
girl
a
native
undoubtedly
but
she
was
neatly
dressed
her
skin
was
light
and
her
hair
twisted
into
a
smooth
black
knot
at
the
back
of
her
head
food
sleep
he
replied
to
her
question
you
ca
stop
here
the
girl
asserted
firmly
oh
yes
we
can
said
emerson
you
have
plenty
of
room
and
lots
of
food
he
indicated
the
shelves
of
canned
goods
the
squaw
without
moving
raised
her
voice
and
called
constantine
constantine
a
door
in
the
farther
shadows
opened
and
the
tall
figure
of
a
man
emerged
advancing
swiftly
his
soft
soles
noiseless
beneath
him
well
well
it
old
cried
fraser
constantine
it
was
the
native
who
had
rescued
them
from
the
river
earlier
in
the
day
but
although
he
must
have
recognized
them
his
demeanor
had
no
welcome
in
it
the
indian
girl
broke
into
a
torrent
of
excited
volubility
unintelligible
to
the
white
men
you
no
stop
here
said
constantine
finally
and
making
toward
the
outer
door
he
flung
it
open
pointing
out
into
the
night
we
come
a
long
way
and
we
tired
emerson
argued
pacifically
we
pay
you
well
constantine
only
replied
with
added
firmness
no
to
which
the
other
retorted
with
a
flash
of
rising
anger
he
faced
the
indian
with
his
back
to
the
stove
his
voice
taking
on
a
determined
note
we
wo
leave
here
until
we
are
ready
we
tired
and
we
going
to
stay
here
do
you
understand
now
tell
your
to
get
us
some
supper
quick
the
breed
face
blazed
without
closing
the
door
he
moved
directly
upon
the
interloper
his
design
recognizable
in
his
threatening
attitude
but
before
he
could
put
his
plan
into
execution
a
soft
voice
from
the
rear
of
the
room
halted
him
constantine
it
said
the
travellers
whirled
to
see
standing
out
in
relief
against
the
darkness
of
the
passage
whence
the
indian
had
just
come
a
few
seconds
before
the
girl
of
the
storm
to
whom
they
had
been
indebted
for
their
rescue
she
advanced
smiling
pleasantly
enjoying
their
surprise
what
is
the
trouble
these
men
no
stop
here
cried
constantine
violently
you
speak
i
make
them
go
i
i
beg
pardon
began
emerson
we
did
intend
to
take
forcible
possession
but
we
played
out
we
been
denied
shelter
everywhere
we
felt
desperate
you
tried
the
canneries
above
interrupted
the
girl
yes
and
they
referred
you
to
the
priest
quite
so
she
laughed
softly
her
voice
a
mellow
contralto
the
father
has
been
gone
for
a
month
he
would
have
let
you
in
if
he
been
there
she
addressed
the
indian
girl
in
aleut
and
signalled
to
constantine
at
which
the
two
natives
retired
constantine
reluctantly
like
a
whose
suspicions
are
not
fully
allayed
we
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
thank
you
for
your
timely
service
this
afternoon
said
emerson
had
we
known
you
lived
here
we
certainly
should
not
have
intruded
in
this
manner
he
found
himself
growing
hotly
uncomfortable
as
he
began
to
realize
the
nature
of
his
position
but
the
young
woman
spared
him
further
apologies
by
answering
carelessly
oh
that
was
nothing
i
been
expecting
you
hourly
you
see
constantine
little
brother
has
the
measles
and
i
had
to
get
to
him
before
the
natives
could
give
the
poor
little
fellow
a
russian
bath
and
then
stand
him
out
in
the
snow
they
have
only
one
treatment
for
all
diseases
that
why
i
did
stop
and
give
you
more
explicit
directions
this
morning
if
your
er
father
the
girl
shook
her
head
then
your
husband
i
should
like
to
arrange
with
him
to
hire
lodgings
for
a
few
days
the
matter
of
money
again
she
came
to
his
rescue
i
am
the
man
of
the
house
i
boss
here
this
splendor
is
all
mine
she
waved
a
slender
white
hand
majestically
at
the
rough
surroundings
laughing
in
a
way
that
put
boyd
emerson
more
at
his
ease
you
are
quite
welcome
to
stay
as
long
as
you
wish
constantine
objects
to
my
hospitality
and
treats
all
strangers
alike
fearing
they
may
be
company
men
when
you
did
arrive
at
dark
i
thought
perhaps
he
was
right
this
time
and
that
you
had
been
taken
in
by
one
of
the
watchmen
we
throwed
a
swede
out
on
his
neck
declared
fraser
swelling
with
conscious
importance
and
i
guess
he
us
with
the
other
squareheads
oh
no
they
have
instructions
not
to
harbor
any
travellers
it
as
much
as
his
job
is
worth
for
any
of
them
to
entertain
you
now
you
make
yourselves
at
home
while
constantine
attends
to
your
dogs
dinner
will
soon
be
ready
and
i
hope
you
will
do
me
the
honor
of
dining
with
me
she
finished
with
a
graciousness
that
threw
emerson
into
fresh
confusion
he
murmured
gladly
and
then
lost
himself
in
wonder
at
this
girl
living
amid
such
surroundings
undeniably
pretty
graceful
in
her
movements
bearing
herself
with
certainty
and
poise
who
was
she
where
did
she
come
from
and
what
in
the
world
was
she
doing
here
he
became
aware
that
fingerless
fraser
was
making
the
introductions
this
is
emerson
my
name
is
french
i
one
of
the
virginia
frenches
you
know
perhaps
you
have
heard
of
them
no
well
the
real
thing
the
girl
bowed
but
emerson
forestalled
her
acknowledgment
by
breaking
in
roughly
with
a
threatening
scowl
at
the
adventurer
his
name
is
french
at
all
madam
it
fraser
fraser
he
an
utterly
worthless
rogue
and
absolutely
unreliable
so
far
as
i
can
learn
i
picked
him
up
on
the
ice
in
norton
sound
with
a
marshal
at
his
heels
that
marshal
was
after
me
stoutly
denied
fraser
quite
unabashed
why
he
a
friend
of
mine
we
regular
chums
everybody
knows
that
he
wanted
to
give
me
some
papers
to
take
outside
that
all
boyd
shrugged
his
shoulders
indifferently
warrants
not
at
all
not
at
all
airily
their
hostess
greatly
amused
at
this
remarkable
turn
of
the
ceremony
prevented
any
further
argument
by
saying
well
french
or
fraser
whichever
it
is
you
are
both
welcome
however
i
should
prefer
to
think
of
you
as
a
runaway
rather
than
as
an
intimate
friend
of
the
marshal
at
nome
i
happen
to
know
him
well
we
ai
what
you
exactly
call
pals
fraser
hastily
disclaimed
i
just
sort
of
bow
to
him
he
gave
an
imitation
of
a
slight
indifferent
headshake
that
way
i
see
commented
their
hostess
quizzically
then
recalling
herself
she
continued
i
should
have
made
myself
known
before
i
am
miss
malotte
ch
began
the
crook
then
shut
his
lips
abruptly
darting
a
shrewd
glance
at
the
girl
emerson
saw
their
eyes
meet
and
fancied
that
the
woman
smile
sat
a
trifle
unnaturally
on
her
lips
while
the
delicate
coloring
of
her
face
changed
imperceptibly
as
the
fellow
mumbled
some
acknowledgment
she
turned
to
the
younger
man
inquiring
impersonally
i
suppose
you
are
bound
for
the
states
yes
we
intend
to
catch
the
at
katmai
i
am
taking
fraser
along
for
company
it
hard
travelling
alone
in
a
strange
country
he
a
nuisance
but
he
rather
amusing
at
times
i
certainly
am
agreed
that
cheerful
person
now
fully
at
his
ease
i
a
bad
memory
for
names
he
looked
queerly
at
his
hostess
but
i
very
amusing
very
not
corrected
emerson
then
they
talked
of
the
trail
the
possibilities
of
securing
supplies
and
of
hiring
a
guide
the
girl
rose
and
after
showing
them
to
a
room
she
excused
herself
on
the
score
of
having
to
see
to
the
dinner
when
she
had
withdrawn
fingerless
fraser
pursed
his
thin
lips
into
a
noiseless
whistle
then
observed
well
i
be
cussed
who
is
she
asked
emerson
in
a
low
eager
tone
do
you
know
you
heard
did
you
she
miss
malotte
and
she
certainly
some
considerable
lady
the
same
look
that
emerson
had
noted
when
their
hostess
introduced
herself
to
them
flitted
again
into
the
crook
unsteady
eyes
yes
but
is
she
what
does
this
mean
emerson
pointed
to
the
provisions
and
fittings
about
them
what
is
she
doing
here
alone
maybe
you
better
ask
her
yourself
said
fraser
for
the
first
time
in
their
brief
acquaintance
emerson
detected
a
strange
note
in
the
rogue
voice
but
it
was
too
slight
to
provoke
reply
so
he
brushed
it
aside
and
prepared
himself
for
dinner
the
indian
girl
summoned
them
and
they
followed
her
through
the
long
passageway
into
the
other
house
where
to
their
utter
astonishment
they
seemed
to
step
out
of
the
frontier
and
into
the
heart
of
civilization
they
found
a
tiny
perfectly
appointed
in
the
centre
of
which
wonder
of
wonders
was
a
round
table
gleaming
like
a
deep
mahogany
pool
upon
the
surface
of
which
floated
gauzy
napery
glinting
silver
and
sparkling
crystal
the
dark
polish
of
the
wood
reflecting
the
light
from
shaded
candles
it
held
a
delicately
figured
service
of
blue
and
gold
while
the
selection
of
glasses
all
in
rows
indicated
the
character
of
the
entertainment
that
awaited
them
the
men
eyes
were
too
busy
with
the
unaccustomed
sight
to
note
details
carefully
but
they
felt
soft
carpet
beneath
their
feet
and
observed
that
the
walls
were
smooth
and
harmoniously
papered
when
one
has
lived
long
in
the
rough
where
things
come
with
the
husk
on
he
fancies
himself
weaned
away
from
the
dainty
the
beautiful
and
the
artistic
after
years
of
a
existence
he
grows
to
feel
a
scorn
for
the
finer
softer
inconsequent
trifles
of
the
past
only
to
find
of
a
sudden
that
unknown
to
him
perhaps
his
soul
has
been
hungering
for
them
all
the
while
the
feel
of
cool
linen
comes
like
the
caress
of
a
forgotten
sweetheart
the
tinkle
of
glass
and
silver
are
so
many
chiming
fairy
bells
inviting
him
back
into
the
foretime
days
and
so
these
two
unkempt
men
toughened
and
browned
to
the
texture
of
leather
by
wind
and
snow
brought
by
trail
and
campfire
to
disregard
ceremony
and
look
upon
mealtime
as
an
unsatisfying
irksome
period
stood
speechless
affording
the
girl
the
feminine
pleasure
of
enjoying
their
discomfiture
this
is
m
marvelous
murmured
emerson
suddenly
conscious
of
his
rough
clothing
his
fur
boots
and
his
hands
cracked
by
frost
afraid
we
not
in
keeping
indeed
you
are
said
the
girl
and
i
am
delighted
to
have
somebody
to
talk
to
it
very
lonesome
here
month
after
month
this
is
certainly
a
swell
tepee
fraser
remarked
staring
about
in
open
admiration
how
did
you
do
it
i
brought
my
things
with
me
from
nome
nome
ejaculated
emerson
quickly
yes
why
i
been
in
nome
ever
since
the
camp
was
discovered
strange
we
never
met
i
did
stay
there
very
long
i
went
back
to
dawson
again
he
fancied
the
girl
eyes
held
a
vague
challenge
but
he
could
not
be
sure
for
she
seated
him
and
then
gave
some
instructions
to
the
aleut
girl
who
had
entered
noiselessly
it
was
the
strangest
meal
boyd
emerson
had
ever
eaten
for
here
in
a
forgotten
corner
of
an
unknown
land
hidden
behind
log
walls
he
partook
of
a
perfect
dinner
well
served
and
presided
over
by
a
gracious
richly
gowned
young
woman
who
talked
interestingly
on
many
subjects
for
a
second
time
he
lost
himself
in
a
maze
of
conjecture
who
was
she
what
was
her
mission
here
why
was
she
alone
but
not
for
long
he
was
too
heavily
burdened
by
the
responsibility
and
care
of
his
own
affairs
to
waste
much
time
by
the
way
on
those
of
other
people
and
becoming
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
he
grew
more
silent
as
the
signs
of
refinement
and
civilization
about
him
revived
memories
long
stifled
fraser
on
the
contrary
warmed
by
the
wine
blossomed
like
the
rose
and
talked
garrulously
recounting
marvellous
stories
as
improbable
as
they
were
egotistical
he
monopolized
his
hostess
attention
the
while
his
companion
became
more
preoccupied
more
almost
sullen
this
was
not
the
effect
for
which
the
girl
had
striven
her
younger
guest
taciturnity
which
grew
as
the
dinner
progressed
piqued
her
so
at
the
first
opportunity
she
bent
her
efforts
toward
rallying
him
he
answered
politely
but
she
was
powerless
to
shake
off
his
mood
it
was
not
abashment
as
she
realized
when
from
the
corner
of
her
eye
she
observed
him
covertly
stroke
the
linen
and
finger
the
silver
as
if
to
renew
a
sense
of
touch
long
unused
being
unaccustomed
to
any
sort
of
indifference
in
men
his
spiritless
demeanor
put
her
on
her
mettle
yet
all
to
no
avail
she
could
not
find
a
seam
in
that
mask
of
listless
abstraction
at
last
he
spoke
of
his
own
accord
you
said
those
watchmen
have
instructions
not
to
harbor
travellers
why
is
that
it
is
the
policy
of
the
companies
they
are
afraid
somebody
will
discover
gold
around
here
yes
you
see
this
is
the
greatest
salmon
river
in
the
world
the
is
tremendous
and
seems
to
be
unfailing
hence
the
cannery
people
wish
to
keep
it
all
to
themselves
i
do
quite
understand
it
is
simple
enough
kalvik
is
so
isolated
and
the
fishing
season
is
so
short
that
the
companies
have
to
send
their
crews
in
from
the
states
and
take
them
out
again
every
summer
now
if
gold
were
discovered
hereabouts
the
fishermen
would
all
quit
and
follow
the
which
would
mean
the
ruin
of
the
year
catch
and
the
loss
of
many
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
for
there
is
no
way
of
importing
new
help
during
the
short
summer
months
why
this
village
would
become
a
city
in
no
time
if
such
a
thing
were
to
happen
the
whole
region
would
fill
up
with
miners
and
not
only
would
labor
conditions
be
entirely
upset
for
years
but
the
eyes
of
the
world
being
turned
this
way
other
people
might
go
into
the
fishing
business
and
create
a
competition
which
would
both
influence
prices
and
deplete
the
supply
of
fish
in
the
kalvik
river
so
you
see
there
are
many
reasons
why
this
region
is
forbidden
to
miners
i
see
you
could
buy
a
pound
of
food
nor
get
a
night
lodging
here
for
a
king
ransom
the
watchmen
jobs
depend
upon
their
unbroken
bond
of
inhospitality
and
the
indians
dare
not
sell
you
anything
not
even
a
dogfish
under
penalty
of
starvation
for
they
are
dependent
upon
the
companies
stores
so
that
is
why
you
have
established
a
of
your
own
oh
dear
no
this
is
a
store
this
food
is
for
my
men
your
men
yes
i
have
a
crew
out
in
the
hills
on
a
this
is
our
cache
while
they
prospect
for
gold
i
stand
guard
over
the
provisions
fraser
chuckled
softly
then
you
are
bucking
the
salmon
trust
after
a
fashion
yes
i
knew
this
country
had
never
been
gone
over
so
i
staked
six
men
chartered
a
schooner
and
came
down
here
from
nome
in
the
early
spring
we
stood
off
the
watchmen
and
when
the
arrived
we
had
these
houses
completed
and
my
men
were
out
in
the
hills
where
it
was
hard
to
follow
them
i
stayed
behind
and
stood
the
brunt
of
things
but
surely
they
did
undertake
to
injure
you
said
emerson
now
thoroughly
interested
in
this
extraordinary
young
woman
oh
did
they
she
answered
with
a
peculiar
laugh
you
appreciate
the
character
of
these
people
when
a
man
fights
for
money
just
plain
sordid
money
he
loses
all
sense
of
honor
chivalry
and
decency
he
employs
any
means
that
come
handy
there
is
no
real
code
of
financial
morality
and
the
battle
for
dollars
is
the
bitterest
of
all
contests
of
course
being
a
woman
they
could
very
well
attack
me
personally
but
they
tried
everything
except
physical
violence
and
i
do
know
how
long
they
will
refrain
from
that
these
plants
are
owned
separately
but
they
operate
under
an
agreement
with
one
man
at
the
head
his
name
is
marsh
willis
marsh
and
of
course
he
not
my
friend
sort
of
we
stand
divided
we
fall
exactly
that
spreads
the
responsibility
and
seems
to
leave
nobody
guilty
for
their
evil
deeds
the
first
thing
they
did
was
to
sink
my
schooner
in
the
morning
you
will
see
her
spars
sticking
up
through
the
ice
out
in
front
there
one
of
their
tugs
ran
her
down
although
she
was
at
anchor
fully
three
hundred
feet
inside
the
channel
line
then
marsh
actually
had
the
effrontery
to
come
here
personally
and
demand
damages
for
the
injury
to
his
towboat
claiming
there
were
no
lights
on
the
schooner
cherry
malotte
eyes
grew
dark
with
indignation
as
she
continued
nobody
thinks
of
hanging
lanterns
to
little
crafts
like
her
at
anchor
under
such
conditions
having
allowed
me
to
taste
his
power
that
man
first
threatened
me
covertly
and
then
proceeded
to
persecute
me
in
a
more
open
manner
when
i
still
remained
obdurate
he
he
she
paused
you
may
have
heard
of
it
he
killed
one
of
my
men
impossible
ejaculated
boyd
oh
but
it
is
impossible
anything
is
possible
with
unscrupulous
men
where
there
is
no
law
they
halt
at
nothing
when
in
chase
of
money
they
are
different
from
women
in
that
i
never
heard
of
a
woman
doing
murder
for
money
was
it
really
murder
judge
for
yourself
my
man
came
down
for
supplies
and
they
got
him
drunk
he
was
a
drinking
man
then
they
stabbed
him
they
said
a
chinaman
did
it
in
a
brawl
but
willis
marsh
was
to
blame
they
brought
the
poor
fellow
here
and
laid
him
on
my
steps
as
if
i
had
been
the
cause
of
it
oh
it
was
horrible
horrible
her
eyes
suddenly
dimmed
over
and
her
white
hands
clenched
and
you
still
stuck
to
your
post
said
emerson
curiously
certainly
this
adventure
means
a
great
deal
to
me
and
besides
will
not
be
the
stem
of
the
glass
with
which
she
had
been
toying
snapped
suddenly
at
anything
she
appeared
all
in
a
breath
to
have
become
prematurely
hard
and
worldly
after
the
fashion
of
those
who
have
subsisted
by
their
wits
to
emerson
she
seemed
to
have
grown
at
least
ten
years
older
yet
it
was
unbelievable
that
this
slip
of
a
woman
should
be
possessed
of
the
determination
the
courage
and
the
administrative
ability
to
conduct
so
desperate
an
enterprise
he
could
understand
the
feminine
rashness
that
might
have
led
her
to
embark
upon
it
in
the
first
place
but
to
continue
in
the
face
of
such
opposition
why
that
was
a
man
work
and
required
a
man
powers
and
yet
she
was
utterly
unmasculine
indeed
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
met
a
more
womanly
woman
everything
about
her
was
distinctly
feminine
fortunately
the
fishing
season
is
short
she
added
while
a
pucker
of
perplexity
came
between
her
dainty
brows
but
i
do
know
what
will
happen
next
summer
i
like
to
meet
this
party
observed
fraser
his
usually
colorless
eyes
a
bright
do
you
fear
further
er
violence
asked
emerson
cherry
shrugged
her
rounded
shoulders
i
anticipate
it
but
i
fear
it
i
have
constantine
to
protect
me
and
you
will
admit
he
is
a
capable
bodyguard
she
smiled
slightly
recalling
the
scene
she
had
interrupted
before
dinner
then
too
chakawana
his
sister
is
just
as
devoted
rather
a
musical
name
do
you
think
so
chakawana
it
means
snowbird
in
aleut
but
when
she
aroused
she
more
like
a
hawk
it
the
russian
in
her
i
dare
say
the
girl
became
conscious
that
her
guests
were
studying
her
with
undisguised
amazement
now
and
therefore
arose
saying
you
may
smoke
in
the
other
room
if
you
wish
lost
in
wonder
at
this
unconventional
creature
and
dazed
by
the
strangeness
of
the
whole
affair
emerson
gained
his
feet
and
followed
her
with
fingerless
fraser
at
his
heels
chapter
iii
in
which
cherry
malotte
displays
a
temper
the
unsuspected
luxury
of
the
and
the
excellence
of
the
dinner
itself
had
in
a
measure
prepared
emerson
for
what
he
found
in
the
one
thing
only
staggered
him
a
piano
the
on
the
floor
the
big
sleepy
chairs
the
littered
with
magazines
the
shelves
of
books
even
the
basket
of
all
these
he
could
accept
without
further
parleying
but
a
piano
in
kalvik
observing
his
look
the
girl
said
i
am
dreadfully
extravagant
am
i
not
but
i
love
it
and
i
have
so
little
to
do
i
read
and
play
and
drive
my
that
about
all
and
rescue
drowning
men
in
time
for
dinner
added
boyd
emerson
not
knowing
whether
he
liked
this
young
woman
or
not
he
knew
this
north
country
from
bitter
experience
knew
that
none
but
the
strong
can
survive
and
recognizing
himself
as
a
failure
her
calm
assurance
and
offended
him
vaguely
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
succeeding
where
he
had
failed
which
rather
jarred
his
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
then
too
conventionality
is
a
very
agreeable
social
bond
the
true
value
of
which
is
not
often
recognized
until
it
is
found
missing
and
this
girl
was
anything
but
conventional
again
he
withdrew
into
that
silent
mood
from
which
no
effort
on
the
part
of
his
hostess
could
arouse
him
and
it
soon
became
apparent
from
the
listless
hang
of
his
hands
and
the
distant
light
in
his
eyes
that
he
had
even
become
unconscious
of
her
presence
in
the
room
observing
the
cause
of
her
impatience
fraser
interrupted
his
interminable
monologue
to
say
without
change
of
intonation
do
get
sore
on
him
he
that
way
half
the
time
i
rode
herd
one
night
on
a
feller
that
was
going
to
hang
for
murder
at
dawn
and
he
set
just
like
that
for
hours
she
raised
her
brows
inquiringly
at
which
he
continued
but
you
ca
always
tell
when
my
brother
got
married
he
acted
the
same
way
after
an
hour
during
which
emerson
barely
spoke
she
tired
of
the
other
man
anecdotes
which
had
long
ceased
to
be
amusing
and
going
to
the
piano
shuffled
the
sheet
music
idly
inquiring
do
you
care
for
music
her
remark
was
aimed
at
emerson
but
the
other
answered
i
a
nut
on
it
she
ignored
the
speaker
and
cast
another
question
over
her
shoulder
what
kind
do
you
prefer
again
the
adventurer
outran
his
companion
to
the
reply
my
favorite
hymn
is
the
leaf
let
her
go
professor
cherry
settled
herself
obligingly
and
played
ragtime
although
she
fancied
that
emerson
stirred
uneasily
as
if
the
musical
interruption
disturbed
him
but
when
she
swung
about
on
her
seat
at
the
conclusion
he
was
still
lax
and
indifferent
that
certainly
has
some
class
to
it
fingerless
fraser
said
admiringly
just
go
through
the
reperchure
from
soda
to
hock
will
you
i
certainly
fond
of
that
coon
clatter
and
realizing
that
his
pleasure
was
genuine
she
played
on
and
on
for
him
to
the
muffled
thump
of
his
feet
now
and
then
feeding
her
curiosity
with
a
stolen
glance
at
the
other
she
was
in
the
midst
of
some
syncopated
measure
when
boyd
spoke
abruptly
please
play
something
she
understood
what
he
meant
and
began
really
to
play
realizing
very
soon
that
at
least
one
of
her
guests
knew
and
loved
music
under
her
deft
fingers
the
instrument
became
a
medium
for
musical
speech
gay
roundelays
swift
passionate
hungarian
dances
bold
wagnerian
strains
followed
in
quick
succession
and
the
more
utter
her
abandon
the
more
certainly
she
felt
the
younger
man
respond
strange
to
say
the
warped
soul
of
fingerless
fraser
likewise
felt
the
spell
of
real
music
and
he
stilled
his
tongue
she
began
to
sing
more
for
her
own
amusement
than
for
theirs
and
after
awhile
her
fingers
strayed
upon
the
sweet
chords
of
bartlett
a
thing
the
tenderness
of
which
had
lived
with
her
from
girlhood
she
heard
emerson
rise
then
knew
he
was
standing
at
her
shoulder
could
he
sing
she
wondered
as
he
began
to
take
up
the
words
of
the
song
then
her
eyes
widened
as
she
listened
to
his
voice
breathing
life
into
the
beautiful
words
he
sang
with
the
ease
and
flexibility
of
an
artist
his
powerful
baritone
blending
perfectly
with
her
contralto
for
the
first
time
she
felt
the
man
personality
his
magnetism
as
if
he
had
dropped
his
cloak
and
stood
at
her
side
in
his
true
semblance
as
they
finished
the
song
she
wheeled
abruptly
her
face
flushed
her
ripe
lips
smiling
her
eyes
moist
and
looked
up
to
find
him
marvelously
transformed
his
even
teeth
gleamed
forth
from
a
brown
face
that
had
become
the
mirror
of
a
soul
as
spirited
as
her
own
for
the
blending
of
their
voices
had
brought
them
into
a
similar
harmony
of
understanding
oh
you
she
breathed
thank
he
said
i
i
that
the
first
time
in
ages
that
had
the
heart
to
sing
i
was
hungry
for
music
i
was
starving
for
it
i
sat
in
my
cabin
at
night
longing
for
it
until
my
soul
fairly
ached
with
the
silence
i
frozen
beneath
the
northern
lights
straining
my
ears
for
the
melody
that
ought
to
go
with
them
they
must
have
an
accompaniment
somewhere
do
you
think
so
yes
yes
she
breathed
they
have
they
are
too
gloriously
terribly
beautiful
to
be
silent
i
stood
in
the
whispering
spruce
groves
and
tried
to
sing
contentment
back
into
my
heart
but
i
could
do
it
this
is
the
first
real
taste
i
had
in
three
years
three
years
he
was
talking
rapidly
his
blue
eyes
dancing
cherry
remembered
thinking
at
dinner
that
those
eyes
were
of
too
light
and
hard
a
blue
for
tenderness
she
now
observed
that
they
were
singularly
deep
and
passionate
why
i
gone
about
with
a
comb
and
a
piece
of
at
my
lips
like
any
kid
i
once
made
a
banjo
out
of
a
and
bale
wire
and
while
i
was
in
the
kougarok
i
walked
ten
miles
to
hear
a
nigger
play
a
harmonica
i
did
all
sorts
of
things
to
coax
music
into
this
country
but
it
is
silent
and
unresponsive
absolutely
dead
and
discordant
he
made
a
gesture
which
in
a
woman
would
have
ended
in
a
shudder
he
took
a
seat
near
the
girl
and
continued
to
talk
feverishly
unable
to
give
voice
to
his
thoughts
rapidly
enough
his
reserve
vanished
his
silence
gave
way
to
a
confidential
warmth
which
suffused
his
listener
and
drew
her
to
him
the
overpowering
force
of
his
strong
nature
swept
her
out
of
herself
while
her
ready
sympathy
took
fire
and
caught
at
his
ideas
and
stumbling
words
stimulating
him
with
her
warm
understanding
her
quick
wit
rallied
him
and
awoke
echoes
of
his
past
youth
until
they
began
to
laugh
and
jest
with
the
of
boy
and
girl
with
their
better
acquaintance
her
assumption
of
masculinity
fell
from
her
and
she
became
the
womanly
woman
dainty
vivacious
captivating
fraser
whom
both
had
forgotten
looked
on
at
first
in
gaping
silent
awe
staring
and
blinking
at
his
travelling
companion
who
had
undergone
such
a
metamorphosis
but
restraint
and
silence
were
impossible
to
him
for
long
and
in
time
he
ambled
clumsily
into
the
conversation
it
jarred
of
course
but
he
could
not
be
ignored
and
gradually
he
claimed
more
and
more
of
the
talk
until
the
young
couple
yielded
to
the
monologue
smiling
at
each
other
in
mutual
understanding
emerson
listened
tolerantly
idly
running
through
the
magazines
at
his
hand
his
hostess
watching
him
covertly
albeit
her
ears
were
drummed
by
the
other
monotone
how
much
better
this
mood
became
the
young
man
suddenly
the
smile
of
amusement
that
lurked
about
his
lip
corners
and
gave
him
a
pleasing
look
hardened
in
a
queer
fashion
he
started
then
stared
at
one
of
the
pages
while
the
color
died
out
of
his
brown
cheeks
cherry
saw
the
hand
that
held
the
magazine
tremble
he
looked
up
at
her
and
disregarding
fraser
broke
in
harshly
have
you
read
this
magazine
not
entirely
it
came
in
the
last
mail
i
like
to
take
one
page
out
of
it
he
said
may
i
why
certainly
she
replied
you
may
have
the
whole
thing
if
you
like
he
produced
a
knife
and
with
one
quick
stroke
cut
a
single
leaf
out
of
the
magazine
which
he
folded
and
thrust
into
the
breast
of
his
coat
thank
you
he
muttered
then
fell
to
staring
ahead
of
him
again
heedless
of
his
surroundings
this
abrupt
relapse
into
his
former
state
of
sullen
and
defiant
silence
tantalized
the
girl
to
the
verge
of
anger
especially
now
that
she
had
seen
something
of
his
true
self
she
was
painfully
conscious
of
a
sense
of
betrayal
at
having
yielded
so
easily
to
his
pleasant
mood
only
to
be
shut
out
on
an
instant
whim
while
a
girlish
curiosity
to
know
the
cause
of
the
change
overpowered
her
he
offered
no
explanation
however
and
took
no
further
part
in
the
conversation
until
noting
the
lateness
of
the
hour
he
rose
and
thanked
her
for
her
hospitality
in
the
same
deadly
indifferent
manner
the
music
was
a
great
treat
he
said
looking
beyond
her
and
holding
aloof
a
very
great
treat
i
enjoyed
it
immensely
cherry
malotte
had
experienced
a
new
sensation
and
she
did
like
it
she
vowed
angrily
that
she
disliked
men
who
looked
past
her
indeed
she
could
not
recall
any
other
who
had
ever
done
so
her
chief
concern
had
always
been
to
check
their
ardor
she
resolved
viciously
that
before
she
was
through
with
this
young
man
he
would
make
her
a
less
listless
adieu
she
assured
herself
that
he
was
a
selfish
sullen
boor
who
needed
to
be
taught
a
lesson
in
manners
for
his
own
good
if
for
nothing
else
that
a
woman
curiosity
had
aught
to
do
with
her
exasperation
she
would
have
denied
she
abhorred
curiosity
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
told
herself
that
he
did
not
interest
her
in
the
least
except
as
a
discourteous
fellow
who
ought
to
be
shocked
into
a
consciousness
of
his
bad
manners
and
therefore
the
moment
the
two
men
were
well
out
of
the
room
she
darted
to
the
table
snatched
up
the
magazine
and
skimmed
through
it
feverishly
ah
here
was
the
place
a
woman
face
with
some
meaningless
name
beneath
filled
each
page
along
the
top
ran
the
heading
famous
american
beauties
so
it
was
a
woman
she
skipped
backward
and
forward
among
the
pages
for
further
possible
enlightenment
but
there
was
no
article
accompanying
the
pictures
it
was
merely
an
illustrated
section
devoted
to
the
photographs
of
prominent
actresses
and
society
women
most
of
whom
she
had
never
heard
of
though
here
and
there
she
saw
a
name
that
was
familiar
in
the
centre
was
that
tantalizingly
edge
which
had
subtracted
a
face
from
the
gallery
a
face
which
she
wanted
very
much
to
see
she
paused
and
racked
her
brain
her
brows
furrowed
with
the
effort
at
recollection
but
she
had
only
glanced
at
the
pages
when
the
magazine
came
and
had
paid
no
attention
to
this
part
of
it
her
anger
at
her
failure
to
recall
this
particular
face
aroused
her
to
the
fact
that
she
was
acting
very
foolishly
at
which
she
laughed
aloud
well
what
of
it
she
demanded
of
the
empty
room
he
in
love
with
some
society
ninny
and
i
do
care
what
she
looks
like
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
carelessly
then
in
a
sudden
access
of
fury
she
flung
the
mutilated
magazine
viciously
into
a
far
corner
of
the
room
the
travellers
slept
late
on
the
following
morning
for
the
weariness
of
weeks
was
upon
them
and
the
little
they
occupied
adjoined
the
main
building
and
was
dark
when
they
came
forth
they
found
chakawana
in
the
store
and
a
few
moments
later
were
called
to
breakfast
where
is
your
mistress
inquired
boyd
she
go
see
my
sick
broder
said
the
indian
girl
recalling
mention
of
the
child
ill
with
measles
she
all
the
time
give
medicine
to
aleut
babies
chakawana
continued
all
the
time
give
give
give
something
indian
people

she
sort
of
a
lady
bountiful
to
these
bums
remarked
fraser

yonder
boyd
asked
indicating
the
store
oh
yes
everything
cheap
to
indian
people
indian
got
no
money
all
the
same
then
as
if
realizing
that
her
hasty
tongue
had
betrayed
some
secret
of
moment
the
aleut
girl
paused
and
eying
them
sharply
demanded
what
for
you
ask
no
reason
in
particular
what
for
you
ask
she
insisted
maybe
you
company
eh
emerson
laughed
but
she
was
not
to
be
put
off
easily
and
with
characteristic
guile
announced
boldly
i
lie
to
you
she
no
trade
with
aleut
people
no
chakawana
lie
she
afraid
we
tell
this
fellow
marsh
fraser
remarked
to
emerson
then
as
if
that
name
had
some
powerful
effect
upon
their
informant
chakawana
advanced
to
the
table
and
leaning
over
it
said
you
know
willis
marsh
her
pretty
wooden
face
held
a
mingled
expression
of
fear
malice
and
curiosity
ouch
said
fraser
shoving
back
from
his
plate
do
look
at
me
like
that
before
i
had
my
coffee
maybe
you
know
him
in
san
flancisco
eh
no
no
we
never
heard
of
him
until
last
night
i
guess

she
smiled
at
them
wheedlingly
but
boyd
reassured
her
no
we
do
know
him
at
all
then
what
for
you
speak
his
name
miss
malotte
told
us
about
him
at
dinner

vaguely

i
do
know
maybe
he
lie
maybe

woman
the
masculine
sex
seems
to
stand
like
a
band
of
with
this
dame
fraser
remarked
to
his
companion
she
thinks
we
all
liars
after
a
moment
chakawana
continued
where
you
go
now
to
the
states
to
the
boyd
answered
then
you
see
willis
marsh
sure
thing
he
lives
there
maybe
you
speak
eh
well
marsh

be
a
big
fellow
around
kalvik
but
i
do
think
he
occupies
so
much
space
in
the
united
states
that
we
will
meet
him
laughed
emerson
but
even
yet
the
girl
seemed
unconvinced
and
went
on
rather
fearfully
maybe
you
see
him
all
the
same
perhaps
what
then
you
speak
my
name
why
no
certainly
not
if
i
see
him
i
give
him
your
love
offered
fingerless
fraser
banteringly
but
chakawana
cheeks
blanched
perceptibly
and
she
cried
quickly
no
no
willis
marsh
bad
bad
man
you
no
speak
please
chakawana
poor
aleut
girl
please
her
alarm
was
so
genuine
that
they
reassured
her
and
having
completed
their
meal
they
rose
and
left
the
room
outside
fraser
said
this
cannery
guy
has
certainly
buffaloed
these
savages
he
must
be
a
then
as
they
filled
their
pipes
he
added
she
was
plumb
scared
to
death
of
him
was
she
think
so
listlessly
sure
did
she
show
it
i
suppose
so
they
were
still
talking
when
they
heard
the
jingle
of
many
bells
then
a
sharp
command
from
constantine
and
the
next
instant
the
door
burst
open
to
admit
cherry
who
came
with
a
rush
of
youth
and
health
as
fresh
as
the
bracing
air
that
followed
her
the
cold
had
reddened
her
cheeks
and
quickened
her
eyes
she
was
the
very
embodiment
of
the
day
itself
radiantly
bright
and
tinglingly
alive
gentlemen
she
cried
removing
the
white
fur
hood
which
gave
a
setting
to
her
sparkling
eyes
and
teeth
oh
but
it
a
glorious
morning
if
you
want
to
feel
your
blood
leap
and
your
lungs
tingle
just
let
constantine
take
you
for
a
spin
behind
that
team
we
did
the
five
miles
from
the
village
in
seventeen
minutes
and
how
is
your
measley
patient
asked
fraser
he
doing
well
thank
you
she
stepped
to
the
door
to
admit
chakawana
who
had
evidently
hurried
around
from
the
other
house
and
now
came
in
bareheaded
and
heedless
of
the
cold
bearing
a
bundle
clasped
to
her
breast
i
brought
the
little
fellow
home
with
me
see
the
indian
girl
bore
her
burden
to
the
stove
where
she
knelt
to
lift
the
covering
from
the
child
face
hey
there
look
out
ejaculated
fraser
retreating
in
alarm
i
never
had
no
measles
but
chakawana
went
on
cuddling
the
infant
in
a
motherly
fashion
while
cherry
reassured
her
guests
is
that
an
indian
child
asked
emerson
curiously
noting
the
little
fellow
flushed
fair
skin
the
kneeling
girl
turned
upward
a
pair
of
tearful
defiant
eyes
answering
quickly
yes
him
aleut
baby
him
our
little
broder
came
the
deep
voice
of
constantine
who
had
entered
unnoticed
and
a
moment
later
in
obedience
to
an
order
from
cherry
they
bore
their
charge
to
their
own
quarters
at
the
rear
chapter
iv
in
which
she
gives
heart
to
a
hopeless
man
i
dare
say
kalvik
is
rather
lively
during
the
summer
season
emerson
remarked
to
cherry
later
in
the
day
yes
the
ships
arrive
in
may
and
the
fish
begin
to
run
in
july
after
that
nobody
sleeps
she
had
come
upon
him
staring
dispiritedly
at
the
fire
and
his
dejection
softened
her
and
drew
out
her
womanly
sympathy
she
had
renewed
her
efforts
to
cheer
him
up
seeking
to
stir
him
out
of
the
gloom
that
imprisoned
him
with
the
healthy
optimism
and
exuberance
of
her
normal
youth
she
could
not
but
deplore
the
mischance
that
had
changed
him
into
the
sullen
silent
brute
he
seemed
it
must
be
rather
interesting
he
observed
indifferently
it
is
more
than
that
it
is
inspiring
why
the
story
of
the
salmon
is
an
epic
in
itself
you
know
they
live
a
cycle
of
four
years
no
more
always
returning
to
the
waters
of
their
nativity
to
die
and
i
have
heard
it
said
that
during
one
of
those
four
years
they
disappear
no
one
knows
where
reappearing
out
of
the
mysterious
depths
of
the
sea
as
if
at
a
signal
they
come
by
the
legion
in
countless
scores
of
thousands
and
when
once
they
have
tasted
the
waters
of
their
birth
they
never
touch
food
again
never
cease
their
onward
rush
until
they
become
bruised
and
battered
wrecks
drifting
down
from
the
when
the
call
of
nature
is
answered
and
the
spawn
is
laid
they
die
they
never
seek
the
salt
sea
again
but
carpet
the
rivers
with
their
bones
when
they
feel
the
homing
impulse
they
come
from
the
remotest
depths
heading
unerringly
for
the
particular
parent
stream
whence
they
originated
if
should
block
their
course
in
dry
seasons
or
obstacles
intercept
them
they
will
hurl
themselves
out
of
the
water
in
an
endeavor
to
get
across
they
may
disregard
a
thousand
rivers
one
by
one
but
when
they
finally
taste
the
sweet
currents
which
flow
from
their
birthplaces
their
whole
nature
changes
and
even
their
physical
features
alter
they
grow
thin
and
the
head
takes
on
the
sinister
curve
of
the
preying
bird
i
had
no
idea
they
acted
that
way
said
boyd
you
paint
a
vivid
picture
that
because
they
interest
me
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
fisheries
are
more
fascinating
than
any
place
i
ever
seen
why
you
just
ought
to
witness
the
these
empty
waters
become
suddenly
crowded
and
the
fish
come
in
a
great
silver
horde
which
races
up
up
up
toward
death
and
obliteration
they
come
with
the
violence
of
a
summer
storm
like
a
prodigious
gleaming
army
they
swarm
and
bend
forward
eager
undeviating
it
quite
impossible
to
describe
it
this
great
silver
horde
they
are
entirely
defenceless
of
course
and
almost
every
living
thing
preys
upon
them
the
birds
congregate
in
millions
the
beasts
come
down
from
the
hills
the
apaches
of
the
sea
harry
them
in
dense
droves
and
even
man
appears
from
distant
coasts
to
take
his
toll
but
still
they
press
bravely
on
the
clank
of
machinery
makes
the
hills
rumble
the
hiss
of
steam
and
the
sighs
of
the
are
like
the
complaint
of
some
giant
overgorging
himself
the
river
swarms
with
the
fleets
of
which
skim
outward
with
the
dawn
to
flit
homeward
again
at
twilight
and
settle
like
a
vast
brood
of
gulls
men
let
the
hours
go
by
unheeded
and
forget
to
sleep
what
sort
of
men
do
they
hire
chinese
japs
and
italians
mainly
it
like
a
foreign
country
here
only
there
are
no
women
the
are
filled
with
opium
fumes
and
noisy
with
clacking
tongues
on
one
side
of
the
village
streets
the
orientals
burn
incense
to
their
joss
across
the
way
the
latins
worship
the
virgin
they
work
side
by
side
all
day
until
they
are
ready
to
drop
then
mass
in
the
street
and
knife
each
other
over
their
rival
gods
how
long
does
it
all
last
only
about
six
weeks
then
the
furnace
fires
die
out
the
ships
are
loaded
the
men
go
to
sleep
and
the
breezes
waft
them
out
into
the
august
haze
after
which
kalvik
sags
back
into
its
ten
months
coma
becoming
as
you
see
it
now
a
dead
deserted
village
shunned
by
man
jove
you
have
a
graphic
tongue
said
boyd
appreciatively
but
i
do
see
how
those
huge
plants
can
pay
for
their
upkeep
with
such
a
short
run
well
they
do
and
what
more
they
pay
tremendously
sometimes
a
hundred
per
cent
a
year
or
more
impossible
emerson
was
now
thoroughly
aroused
and
cherry
continued
two
years
ago
a
ship
sailed
into
port
in
early
may
loaded
with
an
army
of
men
with
machinery
lumber
coal
and
so
forth
they
landed
built
the
plant
and
had
it
ready
to
operate
by
the
time
the
run
started
they
made
their
catch
and
sailed
away
again
in
august
with
enough
salmon
in
the
hold
to
pay
twice
over
for
the
whole
thing
willis
marsh
did
even
better
than
that
the
year
before
but
of
course
the
price
of
fish
was
high
then
next
season
will
be
another
big
year
how
is
that
every
fourth
season
the
run
is
large
nobody
knows
why
every
time
there
is
a
presidential
election
the
fish
are
shy
and
very
scarce
that
lifts
prices
every
year
in
which
a
president
of
the
united
states
is
inaugurated
they
are
plentiful
boyd
laughed
the
alaska
salmon
takes
more
interest
in
politics
than
i
do
i
wonder
if
he
is
a
republican
or
a
democrat
inasmuch
as
he
is
a
red
salmon
i
dare
say
you
call
him
a
socialist
laughed
cherry
emerson
rose
and
began
to
pace
back
and
forth
and
you
mean
to
say
the
history
of
the
other
canneries
is
the
same
certainly
i
had
no
idea
there
were
such
profits
in
the
fisheries
up
here
nobody
knows
it
outside
of
those
interested
the
kalvik
river
is
the
most
wonderful
salmon
river
in
the
world
for
it
has
never
failed
once
that
why
the
companies
guard
it
so
jealously
that
why
they
denied
you
shelter
you
see
it
is
set
away
off
here
in
one
corner
of
behring
sea
without
means
of
communication
or
access
and
they
intend
to
keep
it
so
it
was
evident
that
the
young
man
was
vitally
interested
now
was
it
the
prospective
vision
of
almighty
dollars
that
was
needed
to
release
the
hidden
spring
that
had
baffled
the
girl
with
this
clue
in
mind
she
watched
him
closely
and
fed
his
eagerness
these
figures
you
mention
are
on
record
he
inquired
i
believe
they
are
available
what
does
it
cost
to
install
and
operate
a
cannery
for
the
first
season
about
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
i
am
told
but
i
believe
one
can
mortgage
his
catch
or
borrow
money
on
it
from
the
banks
and
so
not
have
to
carry
the
full
burden
the
man
stared
at
his
companion
with
unseeing
eyes
for
a
moment
then
asked
what
to
prevent
me
from
going
into
the
business
several
things
have
you
the
money
possibly
what
else
a
site
that
ought
to
be
easy
cherry
laughed
on
the
contrary
a
suitable
cannery
site
is
very
hard
to
get
because
there
are
natural
conditions
necessary
fresh
flowing
water
for
one
and
furthermore
because
the
companies
have
taken
them
all
up
ah
i
see
the
light
died
out
of
emerson
eyes
the
eagerness
left
his
voice
he
flung
himself
dejectedly
into
a
chair
by
the
fire
moodily
watching
the
flames
licking
the
burning
logs
all
at
once
he
gripped
the
arms
of
his
chair
and
muttered
through
set
jaws
god
like
to
take
one
more
chance
the
girl
darted
a
swift
look
at
him
but
he
fell
to
brooding
again
evidently
insensible
to
her
presence
at
length
he
stirred
himself
to
ask
can
i
hire
a
guide
hereabout
have
to
be
going
on
in
a
day
or
so
constantine
will
get
you
one
i
suppose
of
course
you
will
avoid
the
katmai
pass
avoid
it
why
it
dangerous
and
nobody
travels
it
except
in
the
direst
emergency
it
much
the
shortest
route
to
the
coast
but
it
has
a
record
of
some
thirty
deaths
i
should
advise
you
to
cross
the
range
farther
east
where
the
divide
is
lower
the
touches
at
both
places
he
nodded
agreement
there
no
use
taking
chances
i
in
no
hurry
i
wish
there
was
some
way
of
repaying
you
for
your
kindness
we
were
pretty
nearly
played
out
when
we
got
here
oh
i
quite
selfish
she
disclaimed
if
you
endured
a
few
months
of
this
monotony
you
understand
during
the
rest
of
that
day
boyd
was
conscious
several
times
of
being
regarded
with
scrutinizing
eyes
by
cherry
at
dinner
and
afterward
in
the
while
fraser
talked
he
surprised
the
same
questioning
look
on
her
face
again
she
played
for
him
but
he
refused
to
sing
maintaining
an
unbroken
taciturnity
after
they
retired
she
sat
long
alone
her
brows
furrowed
as
if
wrestling
with
some
knotty
problem
i
wonder
if
he
would
do
it
she
said
at
last
i
wonder
if
he
do
it
she
rose
and
began
to
pace
the
floor
then
added
as
if
in
desperation
well
i
must
do
for
this
ca
last
who
knows
perhaps
this
is
my
chance
perhaps
he
has
been
sent
there
are
times
when
momentous
decisions
are
influenced
by
the
most
trivial
circumstances
times
when
affairs
of
the
greatest
importance
are
made
or
marred
by
the
lift
of
an
eyebrow
or
the
tone
of
a
voice
times
when
associations
are
severed
and
new
ties
contracted
purely
upon
intuition
and
this
woman
felt
instinctively
that
such
an
hour
had
now
struck
for
her
it
was
late
before
she
finally
came
to
peace
with
the
conflict
in
her
mind
and
lay
herself
down
to
rest
on
the
following
morning
she
told
constantine
to
hitch
up
her
team
and
have
it
waiting
when
breakfast
was
finished
then
she
turned
to
emerson
who
came
into
the
room
and
said
quietly
i
have
something
to
show
you
if
you
will
take
a
short
ride
with
me
the
young
man
impressed
by
the
gravity
of
her
manner
readily
consented
half
an
hour
later
he
wrapped
her
up
in
the
and
took
station
at
the
rear
whip
in
hand
constantine
freed
the
leader
and
they
went
off
at
a
mad
run
whisking
out
from
the
buildings
and
swooping
down
the
steep
bank
to
the
trail
when
they
had
gained
the
level
and
the
dogs
were
straightened
into
their
gait
they
skimmed
over
the
snow
with
the
flight
of
a
bird
that
a
wonderful
team
you
have
boyd
observed
as
he
glanced
over
the
double
row
of
undulating
gray
backs
and
waving
tails
the
best
in
the
country
she
smiled
back
at
him
they
are
good
for
a
hundred
miles
a
day
the
young
man
gave
himself
up
to
the
unique
and
rather
delightful
experience
of
being
transported
through
an
unknown
country
to
an
unknown
destination
by
a
charming
girl
of
whom
he
also
knew
nothing
he
watched
her
in
silence
but
when
he
forebore
to
question
her
she
turned
exposing
a
rounded
ravishing
cheek
glowing
against
the
white
fur
of
her
hood
have
you
no
curiosity
sir
none
nothing
but
satisfaction
he
observed
it
was
his
first
attempt
at
gallantry
and
she
flashed
him
a
bright
approving
glance
then
as
if
suddenly
checked
by
second
thought
she
frowned
slightly
and
turned
away
she
had
mapped
out
a
course
of
action
during
the
night
in
which
it
was
her
purpose
to
use
this
man
if
he
proved
amenable
but
the
success
of
her
plan
would
depend
largely
on
a
continuance
of
their
present
friendly
relations
in
order
therefore
to
forestall
any
possible
change
of
base
she
began
to
unfold
her
scheme
in
a
tone
yesterday
you
seemed
to
be
taken
by
the
fishing
business
i
certainly
was
until
you
told
me
there
were
no
cannery
sites
left
there
is
one
when
i
came
here
a
year
ago
the
whole
river
was
open
so
on
an
outside
chance
i
located
a
site
the
best
one
available
when
willis
marsh
learned
of
it
he
took
up
all
of
the
remaining
places
and
although
at
the
time
i
had
no
idea
what
i
was
going
to
do
with
my
property
i
have
hung
on
to
it
is
that
where
we
are
going
yes
you
seemed
eager
yesterday
to
get
in
on
a
new
chance
so
i
am
taking
you
out
to
look
over
the
ground
what
the
use
i
ca
buy
your
site
nobody
asked
you
to
she
smiled
i
would
sell
it
to
you
if
you
had
the
money
but
if
you
will
build
a
cannery
on
it
i
turn
in
the
ground
for
an
interest
emerson
meditated
a
moment
then
replied
i
ca
say
yes
or
no
a
pretty
big
proposition
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
you
said
yes
it
a
big
opportunity
you
can
clean
up
a
hundred
per
cent
in
a
year
do
you
think
you
could
raise
the
money
to
build
a
plant
i
might
i
have
some
wealthy
friends
he
said
cautiously
but
i
am
not
sure
at
least
you
can
try
that
all
anybody
can
do
but
i
do
know
anything
about
the
business
i
could
make
it
succeed
i
thought
of
all
that
and
there
a
way
to
make
success
certain
i
believe
you
have
executive
ability
and
can
handle
men
oh
yes
i
done
that
sort
of
thing
his
broad
shoulders
went
up
as
he
drew
a
long
breath
what
your
plan
there
a
man
down
the
coast
george
balt
who
knows
more
about
the
business
than
any
four
people
in
kalvik
he
been
a
fisherman
all
his
life
he
discovered
the
kalvik
river
built
the
first
cannery
here
and
was
its
foreman
until
he
quarrelled
with
marsh
who
proceeded
to
discipline
him
balt
is
the
kind
of
man
to
be
disciplined
so
not
having
enough
money
to
build
a
cannery
he
took
his
scanty
capital
and
started
a
saltery
on
his
own
account
that
suited
marsh
exactly
he
broke
george
in
a
year
absolutely
ruined
him
utterly
wiped
him
out
just
as
he
intends
to
wipe
out
insignificant
me
thinking
to
bide
his
time
and
recoup
his
fallen
fortunes
george
came
back
into
camp
but
he
owns
a
valuable
trap
site
which
marsh
and
his
colleagues
want
and
before
they
would
give
him
work
they
tried
to
make
him
assign
it
to
them
and
contract
never
to
go
in
business
on
his
own
account
naturally
george
refused
so
they
disciplined
him
some
more
he
been
starving
now
for
two
years
marsh
and
his
companions
rule
this
region
just
as
the
hudson
bay
company
used
to
govern
its
concessions
by
controlling
the
natives
and
preventing
independent
white
men
from
gaining
a
foothold
no
man
dares
to
furnish
food
to
george
balt
no
man
dares
to
give
him
a
bed
no
cannery
will
let
him
work
he
has
to
take
a
dory
to
dutch
harbor
to
get
food
he
does
dare
leave
the
country
and
abandon
the
meagre
thousands
he
has
invested
in
buildings
so
he
has
stayed
on
living
off
the
country
like
a
siwash
he
a
simple
sort
of
fellow
but
his
life
is
centred
in
this
business
it
all
he
knows
he
considers
himself
the
father
of
this
section
and
when
he
sees
others
rounding
up
the
task
that
he
began
it
breaks
his
poor
heart
why
every
summer
when
the
run
starts
he
comes
across
the
marshes
and
slinks
about
the
kalvik
thickets
like
a
wraith
watching
from
afar
just
in
order
to
be
near
it
all
he
stands
alone
and
forsaken
harking
to
the
clank
of
the
machinery
every
bolt
of
which
he
placed
watching
his
enemies
enrich
themselves
from
that
gleaming
silver
army
which
he
considers
his
very
own
he
is
shunned
like
a
leper
no
man
is
allowed
to
speak
to
him
or
render
him
any
sort
of
fellowship
and
it
has
made
the
man
half
mad
it
has
turned
him
into
a
vengeful
fanatic
living
only
for
retaliation
some
time
i
believe
he
will
kill
marsh
one
seems
to
be
forever
crossing
the
trail
of
this
marsh
said
boyd
who
had
listened
intently
yes
his
aim
is
to
gain
control
of
this
whole
region
and
if
you
decide
to
go
into
the
enterprise
you
must
expect
to
find
him
the
most
unscrupulous
and
vindictive
enemy
ever
man
had
make
no
mistake
about
that
it
only
fair
to
warn
you
that
this
will
be
no
child
play
but
on
the
other
hand
the
man
who
beats
marsh
will
have
done
something
she
paused
as
if
weighing
her
next
words
then
said
deliberately
and
i
believe
you
are
the
one
to
do
it
but
emerson
was
not
concerned
about
his
destiny
just
then
nor
for
the
dangerous
enmity
of
marsh
he
was
following
another
train
of
thought
and
so
balt
knows
this
business
from
the
inside
out
he
said
thoroughly
every
dip
angle
and
spur
of
it
so
to
speak
practical
and
he
honest
in
addition
to
which
his
is
the
key
to
the
whole
situation
you
see
the
salmon
run
in
regular
definite
courses
year
after
year
just
as
if
they
were
following
a
beaten
track
at
certain
places
these
courses
come
close
to
the
shore
where
conditions
make
it
possible
to
drive
piling
and
build
traps
which
intercept
them
by
the
million
one
trap
will
do
the
work
of
an
army
of
fishermen
with
nets
in
deep
water
it
is
to
get
this
property
for
himself
that
marsh
has
persecuted
george
so
unflaggingly
would
he
join
us
in
such
an
enterprise
with
five
chances
to
one
against
success
would
he
cherry
laughed
wait
and
see
they
had
reached
their
destination
the
mouth
of
a
deep
creek
up
which
cherry
turned
her
dogs
emerson
leaped
from
the
sled
and
running
forward
seized
the
leader
guiding
it
into
a
clump
of
spruce
among
the
boles
of
which
he
tangled
the
harness
for
this
team
was
like
a
pack
of
wolves
ravenous
for
travel
and
intolerant
of
the
leash
together
they
ascended
the
bank
and
surveyed
the
surroundings
cherry
expatiating
upon
every
feature
with
the
fervor
of
a
land
agent
bent
on
weaving
his
spell
about
a
prospective
buyer
and
in
truth
she
had
chosen
well
for
the
conditions
seemed
ideal
it
all
sounds
wonderfully
attractive
and
feasible
said
boyd
at
last
but
we
must
weigh
the
overwhelming
odds
against
success
first
of
course
is
the
question
of
capital
i
have
a
little
property
of
my
own
which
i
can
convert
but
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
that
a
tremendous
sum
to
raise
even
for
a
fellow
with
a
circle
of
wealthy
friends
second
there
the
question
of
time
it
now
early
december
and
i
have
to
be
back
here
by
the
first
of
may
third
could
i
run
the
plant
and
make
it
succeed
it
must
be
a
wonderfully
technical
business
and
i
am
utterly
ignorant
of
every
phase
of
it
then
too
there
are
a
thousand
other
difficulties
such
as
getting
machinery
out
here
in
time
hiring
chinese
labor
chartering
a
ship
placing
the
output
george
balt
has
done
all
that
many
times
and
knows
everything
about
it
cherry
interrupted
with
decision
every
difficulty
can
be
met
when
the
time
comes
what
other
people
have
done
you
ought
to
be
able
to
do
but
he
was
not
to
be
won
by
flattery
youth
that
he
was
he
already
knew
the
vanity
of
human
hopes
and
it
was
his
nature
to
look
at
all
sides
of
a
question
before
answering
it
finally
the
slightest
error
of
judgment
would
mean
failure
and
ruin
he
reflected
for
this
country
is
like
any
other
it
is
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
and
there
no
time
to
go
back
and
pick
up
the
odds
are
great
of
course
she
acquiesced
but
the
winnings
are
in
proportion
it
is
casino
by
any
means
this
is
worth
while
every
man
who
has
done
anything
in
this
world
believes
in
a
goddess
of
luck
and
it
the
element
of
chance
that
makes
life
worth
living
that
all
right
in
theory
he
answered
her
somewhat
cynically
but
in
practice
you
find
that
luck
is
largely
the
result
of
previous
judgment
for
every
obstacle
i
have
mentioned
a
thousand
unsuspected
difficulties
will
arise
any
one
of
which
the
girl
interrupted
him
sharply
for
a
second
time
looking
him
squarely
in
the
eyes
her
own
flushed
face
alight
with
determination
there
only
one
person
in
the
whole
world
who
can
defeat
you
and
that
person
is
yourself
and
no
man
can
finish
a
task
before
he
begins
it
we
grant
there
a
chance
for
failure
a
million
chances
but
do
try
to
count
them
count
the
chances
for
success
do
be
for
there
no
such
thing
as
fear
it
does
exist
it
merely
an
absence
of
courage
just
as
indecision
is
merely
a
lack
of
decision
i
never
saw
anything
yet
of
which
i
was
afraid
and
a
the
deity
of
success
is
a
woman
and
she
insists
on
being
won
not
courted
you
got
to
seize
her
and
bear
her
off
instead
of
standing
under
her
window
with
a
mandolin
you
need
to
be
rough
and
masterful
with
her
nobody
ever
reasoned
himself
out
of
a
street
fight
he
had
to
act
if
a
man
thinks
over
a
proposition
long
enough
it
will
whip
him
no
matter
how
simple
it
is
it
the
lightning
flash
that
guides
a
man
you
must
lay
your
course
in
the
blue
dazzle
then
follow
it
in
the
dark
and
when
you
come
to
the
end
it
always
lightens
again
do
stand
still
staring
through
the
gloom
and
then
try
to
walk
while
the
lightning
lasts
because
you
wo
get
anywhere
her
words
were
charged
with
an
electric
force
that
communicated
itself
to
the
young
man
and
galvanized
him
into
action
he
would
have
spoken
but
she
stayed
him
and
went
on
wait
i
not
through
yet
i
watched
you
and
i
know
you
are
down
on
your
luck
for
some
reason
you
been
miscast
somehow
and
had
the
heart
taken
out
of
you
but
i
sure
it
in
you
to
succeed
for
you
young
and
intelligent
cool
and
determined
i
am
giving
you
this
chance
to
play
the
biggest
game
of
your
life
and
erase
in
eight
short
months
every
trace
of
failure
i
not
doing
it
altogether
unselfishly
for
i
believe
you
been
sent
to
kalvik
to
work
out
your
own
salvation
and
mine
and
that
of
poor
george
balt
whom
you
never
seen
you
going
to
do
this
thing
and
you
going
to
make
it
win
emerson
reached
out
impulsively
and
caught
her
tiny
mittened
hand
his
eyes
were
shining
his
face
had
lost
the
settled
look
of
dejection
and
was
all
aglow
with
a
new
dawn
of
hope
even
his
shoulders
were
lifted
and
thrown
back
as
if
from
some
sudden
access
of
vigor
that
lightened
his
burden
you
right
he
said
firmly
we
send
for
balt
chapter
v
in
which
a
compact
is
formed
now
that
he
had
committed
himself
to
action
boyd
emerson
became
a
different
being
he
was
no
longer
the
dispirited
cynic
of
yesterday
but
an
eager
voluble
optimist
athirst
for
knowledge
and
afire
with
impatience
on
the
homeward
drive
he
had
bombarded
cherry
with
a
running
fusillade
of
questions
so
that
by
the
time
they
had
arrived
at
her
house
she
was
mentally
and
physically
fatigued
he
seemed
insatiable
drawing
from
her
every
atom
of
information
she
possessed
and
although
he
was
still
hard
incisive
and
aloof
it
was
in
quite
a
different
way
the
intensity
of
his
concentration
had
gathered
all
feeling
into
one
definite
passion
and
had
sucked
him
dry
of
ordinary
emotions
in
the
days
that
followed
she
was
at
his
elbow
constantly
aiding
him
at
every
turn
in
his
zeal
to
acquire
a
knowledge
of
the
cannery
system
the
odd
conviction
grew
upon
her
that
he
was
working
against
time
that
there
was
a
limit
to
his
period
of
action
for
he
seemed
obsessed
by
an
passion
to
accomplish
some
end
within
a
given
time
and
had
no
thought
for
anything
beyond
the
engrossing
issue
into
which
he
had
plunged
she
was
dumfounded
by
his
sudden
transformation
and
delighted
at
first
but
later
when
she
saw
that
he
regarded
her
only
as
a
means
to
an
end
his
cool
assumption
of
leadership
piqued
her
and
she
felt
hurt
constantine
had
been
sent
for
balt
with
instructions
to
keep
on
until
he
found
the
fisherman
even
if
the
quest
carried
him
over
the
range
during
the
days
of
impatient
waiting
they
occupied
their
time
largely
in
reconnoitring
the
nearest
cannery
permission
to
go
over
which
cherry
had
secured
from
the
watchman
who
was
indebted
to
her
the
man
was
timid
at
first
but
emerson
won
him
over
then
proceeded
to
pump
him
dry
of
information
as
he
had
done
with
his
hostess
he
covered
the
plant
like
a
ferret
he
showed
such
powers
of
adaptability
and
assimilation
as
to
excite
the
girl
wonder
his
grasp
of
detail
was
instant
his
retentive
faculty
tenacious
he
never
seemed
to
rest
why
you
already
know
more
about
a
cannery
than
a
superintendent
does
she
remarked
after
nearly
a
week
of
this
i
believe
you
could
build
one
yourself
he
smiled
i
an
engineer
by
education
and
this
is
really
in
my
line
it
the
other
part
that
has
me
guessing
balt
can
handle
that
but
why
does
he
come
he
questioned
crossly
a
score
of
times
he
had
voiced
his
impatience
and
cherry
was
hard
pushed
to
soothe
him
nor
was
she
the
only
one
to
note
the
change
in
him
fraser
followed
him
about
and
looked
on
in
bewilderment
what
have
you
done
to
annie
he
asked
cherry
on
one
occasion
you
must
have
fed
him
a
for
i
never
saw
a
guy
gear
up
so
fast
why
he
was
the
darndest
i
ever
met
till
you
got
him
gingered
up
he
did
have
no
more
spirit
than
a
sick
kitten
of
course
he
ai
what
you
call
genial
and
expansive
yet
but
he
developed
a
remarkable
burst
of
speed
and
seems
downright
hopeful
at
times
hopeful
of
what
ah
that
where
i
wander
he
a
puzzle
to
me
hopeful
of
making
money
i
suppose
that
is
it
i
can
see
he
does
care
for
the
money
itself
the
girl
declared
emphatically
she
would
have
liked
to
ask
fraser
if
he
knew
anything
about
the
mysterious
beauty
of
the
magazine
but
refrained
i
do
think
so
either
said
the
man
he
acts
more
like
somebody
was
going
to
ring
the
gong
on
him
if
this
fish
thing
do
let
him
out
it
seems
to
be
a
case
bet
with
him
it
a
case
bet
with
me
too
said
the
girl
my
men
are
ready
to
quit
and
well
willis
marsh
will
see
that
i
am
financially
ruined
oho
so
this
is
your
only
grinned
fingerless
fraser
now
i
had
a
different
idea
as
to
why
you
got
emerson
started
he
was
observing
her
shrewdly
what
idea
pray
well
talking
straight
and
subterfuge
this
is
a
lonely
place
for
a
woman
like
you
and
our
mutual
friend
ai
altogether
unattractive
cherry
cheeks
flamed
but
her
tone
was
icy
this
is
entirely
a
business
matter
hm
m
i
ai
never
heard
you
touted
none
as
a
business
woman
said
the
adventurer
have
you
ever
heard
me
the
color
faded
from
the
girl
face
and
it
was
a
trifle
drawn
discussed
in
way
you
know
emerson
makes
me
uncomfortable
sometimes
he
is
so
damn
moral
fraser
replied
indirectly
he
wo
stand
for
anything
off
color
he
a
real
square
guy
he
is
the
kind
you
read
about
you
did
answer
my
question
insisted
cherry
again
fraser
evaded
the
issue
now
if
this
marsh
is
going
after
you
in
earnest
this
summer
why
do
you
let
me
stick
around
here
till
spring
and
your
game
i
drop
a
in
his
or
put
a
spider
in
his
dumpling
and
it
more
than
an
even
shot
that
if
him
and
i
got
to
know
each
other
right
well
i
own
his
cannery
before
fall
thank
you
i
can
take
care
of
myself
said
the
girl
in
a
tone
that
closed
the
conversation
late
one
stormy
night
constantine
had
been
gone
a
week
the
two
men
whom
they
were
expecting
blew
in
through
the
blinding
smother
half
frozen
and
exhausted
with
the
marks
of
hard
travel
showing
in
their
sunken
cheeks
and
in
the
bleeding
pads
of
their
but
although
a
hundred
miles
of
impassable
trails
lay
behind
them
balt
refused
rest
or
nourishment
until
he
had
learned
why
cherry
had
sent
for
him
what
wrong
he
demanded
of
her
staring
with
suspicious
eyes
at
the
strangers
as
briefly
as
possible
she
outlined
the
situation
the
while
boyd
emerson
took
his
measure
for
no
person
quite
like
this
fisherman
had
ever
crossed
the
miner
path
he
saw
a
huge
creature
whose
tremendous
muscles
bulged
beneath
his
nondescript
garments
whose
red
upstanding
bristle
of
hair
topped
a
leather
countenance
from
which
gleamed
a
pair
of
the
most
violent
eyes
emerson
had
ever
beheld
the
dominant
expression
of
which
was
rage
his
jaw
was
long
and
the
seams
from
nostril
and
lip
half
hidden
behind
a
stiff
stubble
gave
it
the
set
of
granite
his
hands
were
gnarled
and
cracked
from
an
immersion
in
brine
his
voice
was
hoarse
with
the
echo
of
drumming
ratlines
he
might
have
lived
forty
sixty
years
but
every
year
had
been
given
to
the
sea
for
its
breath
was
in
his
lungs
its
foaming
violence
was
in
his
blood
as
the
significance
of
cherry
words
sank
into
his
mind
the
signs
of
an
unholy
joy
overspread
the
fisherman
visage
his
thick
lips
writhed
into
an
evil
grin
and
his
hairy
paws
continued
to
open
and
close
hungrily
do
you
mean
business
he
bellowed
at
emerson
i
do
can
you
fight
yes
will
you
do
what
i
tell
you
or
have
you
got
a
lot
of
sick
notions
no
the
young
man
declared
stoutly
i
have
no
scruples
but
i
do
what
you
or
anybody
else
tells
me
i
do
what
i
please
i
intend
to
run
this
enterprise
absolutely
and
run
it
my
way
this
gang
wo
stop
at
anything
warned
balt
neither
will
i
affirmed
the
other
with
a
scowl
and
a
dangerous
of
his
lip
corners
i
to
win
so
do
waste
time
wondering
how
far
i
go
what
i
want
to
know
is
if
you
will
join
my
enterprise
the
giant
uttered
a
mirthless
chuckle
i
give
my
life
to
it
i
knew
you
would
flashed
cherry
her
eyes
beaming
and
if
we
do
beat
willis
marsh
by
god
i
kill
him
balt
shouted
fully
capable
of
carrying
out
his
threat
for
his
bloodshot
eyes
were
lit
with
bitter
hatred
and
the
memory
of
his
wrongs
was
like
gall
in
his
mouth
turning
to
the
girl
he
said
now
give
me
something
to
eat
i
been
living
on
dog
fish
till
my
belly
is
full
of
bones
he
ripped
the
ragged
parka
from
his
back
and
flung
it
in
a
sodden
heap
beside
the
stove
then
strode
after
her
with
the
others
following
she
seated
him
at
her
table
and
spread
food
before
him
great
quantities
of
food
which
he
devoured
ravenously
humped
over
in
his
seat
like
a
bear
his
jaw
hanging
close
to
his
plate
his
appetite
was
as
ungoverned
as
his
temper
he
did
not
taste
his
meal
nor
note
its
character
but
demolished
whatever
fell
first
to
his
hand
staring
curiously
up
from
under
his
thatched
brows
at
emerson
now
and
then
grunting
some
interruption
to
the
other
rapid
talk
of
cherry
and
of
fingerless
fraser
who
regarded
him
with
awe
he
took
not
the
slightest
heed
he
gorged
himself
with
sufficient
provender
for
four
people
then
observing
that
the
board
was
empty
swept
the
crumbs
and
remnants
from
his
lips
and
rose
saying
now
let
go
out
by
the
stove
i
been
cold
for
three
days
cherry
left
the
two
of
them
there
and
long
after
she
had
gone
to
bed
she
heard
the
murmur
of
their
voices
it
all
arranged
they
advised
her
at
the
we
leave
she
echoed
blankly
likewise
questioned
fraser
in
alarm
oh
say
you
do
that
my
feet
are
too
sore
to
travel
i
certainly
got
a
bad
pair
of
we
start
in
the
morning
we
have
no
time
to
waste
cherry
turned
to
the
fisherman
you
ca
get
ready
so
soon
george
i
ready
now
answered
the
big
fellow
she
felt
a
sudden
dread
at
her
heart
what
if
they
failed
and
did
not
return
what
if
some
untoward
peril
should
overtake
them
on
the
outward
trip
it
was
a
hazardous
journey
and
george
balt
was
the
most
reckless
man
on
the
behring
coast
she
cast
a
frightened
glance
at
emerson
but
none
of
the
men
noticed
it
even
if
they
had
observed
the
light
that
had
come
into
those
clear
eyes
they
would
not
have
known
it
for
the
dawn
of
a
new
love
any
more
than
she
herself
realized
what
her
reasonless
fears
betokened
she
had
little
time
to
ponder
however
for
emerson
next
words
added
to
her
alarm
we
catch
the
at
katmai
katmai
she
broke
in
sharply
you
said
you
were
going
by
the
iliamna
route
the
other
is
shorter
she
turned
on
balt
angrily
you
know
better
than
to
suggest
such
a
thing
i
did
suggest
it
said
balt
it
emerson
own
idea
he
insists
i
for
the
long
safe
proposition
every
time
fraser
announced
as
if
settling
the
matter
definitely
languidly
filling
his
pipe
boyd
voice
broke
in
curtly
upon
his
revery
you
not
going
with
us
the
hell
i
ai
exploded
the
other
why
not
there
wo
be
room
you
understand
it
hard
travelling
with
three
oh
see
here
now
pal
you
promised
to
take
me
to
the
states
the
adventurer
demurred
you
would
slough
me
at
this
after
you
he
was
visibly
alarmed
very
well
said
emerson
resignedly
if
you
feel
that
way
about
it
come
along
but
i
wo
take
you
east
of
seattle
seattle
ai
so
bad
fraser
replied
i
guess
i
can
pick
up
a
pinch
of
change
there
all
right
but
kalvik
wow
why
do
you
have
to
go
so
soon
cherry
asked
emerson
when
the
two
others
had
left
them
because
every
day
counts
but
why
the
katmai
route
it
the
stormy
season
and
you
may
have
to
wait
two
weeks
for
the
after
you
reach
the
coast
yes
but
on
the
other
hand
if
we
should
miss
it
by
one
day
it
would
mean
a
month
delay
she
ought
to
be
due
in
about
ten
days
so
we
ca
take
any
chances
i
shall
be
dreadfully
worried
until
i
know
you
are
safely
over
said
the
girl
a
new
note
of
wistful
tenderness
in
her
voice
nonsense
we
all
taken
bigger
risks
before
do
you
know
she
began
hesitatingly
i
been
thinking
that
perhaps
you
better
not
take
up
this
enterprise
after
all
why
not
he
asked
with
an
incredulous
stare
i
thought
you
were
enthusiastic
on
the
subject
i
am
i
believe
in
the
proposition
thoroughly
cherry
limped
on
but
well
i
was
entirely
selfish
in
getting
you
started
for
it
possibly
means
my
own
salvation
but
it
my
last
chance
also
boyd
broke
in
that
only
another
reason
for
you
to
continue
however
why
have
you
suddenly
weakened
because
i
see
you
do
realize
what
you
are
going
into
she
said
desperately
because
you
do
appreciate
the
character
of
the
men
you
will
clash
with
there
is
actual
physical
peril
attached
to
this
undertaking
and
marsh
wo
hesitate
to
to
do
anything
under
the
sun
to
balk
you
it
is
worth
while
risking
your
life
for
a
few
dollars
oh
is
it
emerson
laughed
a
trifle
harshly
my
dear
girl
you
do
know
what
i
am
willing
to
risk
for
those
dollars
you
know
what
success
means
to
me
why
if
i
do
make
this
thing
win
i
be
perfectly
willing
to
let
marsh
wreak
his
vengeance
upon
me
i
might
even
help
him
oh
no
you
may
rest
assured
of
one
thing
if
he
is
unscrupulous
so
shall
i
be
if
he
undertakes
to
check
me
i
well
i
fight
fire
with
fire
his
face
was
not
pleasant
to
look
at
now
and
the
girl
felt
an
access
of
that
vague
alarm
which
had
been
troubling
her
of
late
she
saw
again
that
old
light
of
sullen
desperation
in
the
man
eye
and
marked
with
it
a
new
dogged
dangerous
gleam
as
of
one
possessed
which
proclaimed
his
extreme
necessity
but
what
has
occurred
to
make
you
change
your
mind
he
asked
causing
the
faintest
flush
to
rise
in
her
cheeks
a
few
days
ago
you
were
a
stranger
now
you
are
a
friend
she
replied
steadily
one
likes
and
dislikes
grow
rapidly
when
they
are
not
choked
by
convention
i
like
you
too
well
to
see
you
do
this
you
are
too
good
a
man
to
become
the
prey
of
those
people
remember
george
balt
balt
has
started
yet
for
the
first
time
he
is
a
real
menace
to
willis
marsh
wo
you
take
my
advice
and
reconsider
urged
the
girl
listen
said
the
young
man
i
came
to
this
country
with
a
definite
purpose
in
mind
and
i
had
three
years
in
which
to
work
it
out
i
needed
money
god
how
i
needed
money
they
may
talk
about
the
emptiness
of
riches
and
tell
you
that
men
labor
not
for
the
but
for
the
pursuit
not
for
the
score
but
for
the
contest
maybe
some
of
them
do
but
with
me
it
was
gold
i
needed
gold
i
had
to
have
and
i
did
care
much
how
i
got
it
so
long
as
i
got
it
honestly
i
crave
the
pleasure
of
earning
it
nor
the
thrill
of
finding
it
i
just
wanted
the
thing
itself
and
came
up
here
because
i
thought
the
opportunities
were
greater
here
than
elsewhere
i
have
gone
to
the
sahara
or
into
thibet
just
as
willingly
i
left
behind
a
good
many
things
to
which
i
had
been
raised
and
forsook
opportunities
which
to
most
fellows
of
my
age
would
seem
golden
but
i
did
it
eagerly
because
i
had
only
three
years
of
grace
and
knew
i
must
win
in
that
time
well
i
went
at
it
no
chance
was
too
desperate
no
peril
was
too
great
no
hardship
too
intense
for
me
i
bent
every
effort
to
my
task
until
mind
and
body
became
sleepless
unresting
implements
for
the
working
out
of
my
purpose
i
lost
all
sensibility
to
effort
to
fatigue
to
physical
suffering
i
forgot
all
things
in
the
world
except
my
one
idea
i
focussed
every
power
upon
my
desire
but
a
curse
was
on
me
a
curse
nothing
less
at
first
i
took
misfortune
philosophically
but
when
it
came
and
slept
with
me
i
began
to
rage
at
it
month
after
month
year
by
year
it
rose
with
me
at
dawn
and
lay
down
by
me
at
night
misfortune
beleaguered
me
and
dogged
my
heels
until
it
became
a
thing
of
amusement
to
every
one
except
myself
to
me
it
was
terrifying
because
my
time
was
shortening
and
the
last
day
of
grace
was
rushing
toward
me
just
to
show
you
what
luck
i
played
in
at
dawson
i
found
a
prospect
that
would
have
made
most
men
rich
and
although
such
a
thing
had
never
happened
in
that
particular
locality
before
it
pinched
out
i
tried
again
and
again
and
again
and
finally
found
another
mine
only
to
be
robbed
of
it
by
the
canadian
laws
in
such
a
manner
that
there
the
faintest
hope
of
my
recovering
the
property
men
told
me
about
opportunities
they
could
avail
themselves
of
and
although
i
did
what
they
themselves
would
have
done
these
chances
proved
to
be
ghastly
jokes
i
finally
shifted
from
mining
to
other
ventures
and
the
town
burned
i
awoke
in
a
midnight
blizzard
to
see
my
chance
for
a
fortune
licked
up
by
flames
while
the
hiss
of
the
water
from
the
firemen
hose
seemed
directed
at
me
and
the
voice
of
the
crowd
sounded
like
jeers
i
was
among
the
first
at
nome
and
staked
alongside
the
discoverers
who
undertook
to
put
me
in
right
for
once
but
although
the
fellows
around
me
made
fortunes
in
a
day
my
ground
was
barren
and
my
swept
clean
by
that
unseen
hand
which
i
always
felt
but
could
never
avoid
i
leased
proven
properties
only
to
find
that
the
pay
ceased
without
reason
i
did
this
so
frequently
that
owners
began
to
refuse
me
and
came
to
consider
me
a
thing
of
evil
omen
once
a
broken
in
a
race
to
the
recorder
office
lost
me
a
fortune
at
another
time
a
corrupt
judge
plunged
me
from
certainty
to
despair
and
all
the
while
my
time
was
growing
shorter
and
i
was
growing
poorer
two
hours
after
the
topkuk
strike
was
made
i
drove
past
the
shaft
but
the
one
partner
known
to
me
had
gone
to
the
cabin
to
build
a
fire
and
the
other
one
lied
to
me
thinking
i
was
a
stranger
i
heard
afterward
that
just
as
i
drove
away
my
friend
came
to
the
door
and
called
after
me
but
the
day
was
bitter
and
my
ears
were
muffled
with
fur
while
the
dry
snow
beneath
the
runners
shrieked
so
that
it
drowned
his
cries
me
chased
me
for
half
a
mile
to
make
me
rich
but
the
hand
of
fate
lashed
my
dogs
faster
and
faster
while
that
hellish
screeching
outdinned
his
voice
six
hours
later
topkuk
was
history
you
seen
stampedes
you
understand
my
name
became
a
and
caused
people
to
laugh
though
they
shrank
from
me
for
miners
and
sailors
are
equally
superstitious
no
man
ever
had
more
opportunities
than
i
and
no
man
was
ever
so
miserably
unfortunate
in
missing
them
in
time
i
became
whipped
utterly
without
hope
yet
almost
from
habit
i
fought
on
and
on
with
my
ears
deaf
to
the
voices
that
mocked
me
three
years
is
very
long
as
you
measure
time
but
the
drags
and
the
priest
prayers
are
an
eternity
when
the
hangman
waits
outside
but
the
time
came
and
passed
at
length
and
i
saw
my
beautiful
breathing
dream
become
a
rotting
corpse
still
i
struggled
along
until
one
day
something
snapped
and
i
gave
up
for
all
time
i
realized
as
you
said
that
i
was
that
i
had
never
been
of
this
land
so
i
was
headed
for
home
home
emerson
smiled
bitterly
the
word
does
mean
anything
to
me
now
but
anyhow
i
was
headed
for
god
country
an
utter
failure
in
a
worse
plight
than
when
i
came
here
when
you
put
this
last
chance
in
front
of
me
it
may
be
another
such
as
the
others
i
have
pursued
for
i
have
been
chasing
rainbows
now
for
three
years
and
i
suppose
i
shall
go
on
chasing
them
but
as
long
as
there
is
a
chance
left
i
ca
quit
i
and
something
tells
me
that
i
have
left
that
thing
behind
at
last
and
i
am
going
to
win
cherry
had
listened
eagerly
to
this
bitter
tirade
and
was
deeply
touched
by
the
pathos
of
the
youth
sense
of
failure
his
poignant
pessimism
however
only
seemed
to
throw
into
relief
the
stubborn
fixedness
of
his
dominant
purpose
the
moving
cause
of
it
all
whatever
it
was
and
it
could
only
be
a
woman
aroused
a
burning
curiosity
in
her
and
she
said
but
you
too
late
you
say
your
time
was
up
some
time
ago
perhaps
he
returned
staring
into
the
distances
that
what
i
was
going
out
to
ascertain
i
thought
i
might
have
a
few
days
of
grace
allowed
me
he
turned
his
eyes
directly
upon
her
and
concluded
in
a
tone
that
why
i
ca
quit
now
that
you
set
me
in
motion
again
now
that
you
given
me
another
chance
that
why
we
leave
and
go
by
way
of
the
katmai
pass
chapter
vi
wherein
boreas
takes
a
hand
all
that
day
the
men
busied
themselves
in
preparation
for
the
start
balt
was
ferociously
exultant
emerson
was
boiling
with
impatience
while
fraser
whose
calm
nothing
disturbed
slept
most
of
the
time
observing
that
this
was
his
last
good
bed
for
a
while
and
therefore
he
wished
to
make
it
work
beneath
her
quiet
cheerfulness
cherry
nursed
a
forlorn
heart
for
when
these
men
were
gone
she
would
be
left
alone
and
friendless
again
buried
in
the
heart
of
an
inaccessible
wilderness
given
over
to
her
fears
and
the
intrigues
of
her
enemies
she
had
eyes
mainly
for
emerson
and
although
in
her
glance
there
was
in
her
heart
was
hot
resentment
first
at
him
because
he
had
awakened
in
her
the
warm
interest
she
felt
for
him
and
second
at
herself
for
harboring
any
such
interest
why
should
this
youth
wrapped
up
in
his
own
affairs
to
her
own
utter
exclusion
give
her
cause
to
worry
why
should
she
allow
him
to
step
into
her
quiet
life
and
upset
her
existence
how
do
you
like
him
she
asked
balt
once
he
my
style
all
right
said
the
big
man
he
and
he
fight
that
what
i
want
somebody
that
wo
blench
at
anything
when
the
time
comes
he
ground
his
teeth
and
his
red
eyes
flamed
reflecting
the
sense
of
injury
that
seared
his
brain
what
he
know
about
the
business
i
do
and
we
make
it
win
but
say
he
awful
at
asking
questions
my
head
aches
and
my
back
is
lame
from
answering
him
seems
like
he
remembers
it
all
too
goaded
by
the
wrong
he
had
suffered
and
almost
maniacal
in
his
eagerness
for
the
coming
struggle
the
giant
frenzy
told
cherry
that
the
fight
would
be
an
unrelenting
one
and
again
a
vague
tremor
of
regret
at
having
drawn
this
youth
into
the
affair
crept
over
her
and
sharpened
the
growing
pain
at
her
heart
during
the
evening
emerson
left
the
two
other
men
in
the
store
and
seeking
her
out
in
the
little
parlor
asked
her
to
play
for
him
she
consented
gladly
and
as
on
their
first
evening
together
he
sang
with
her
again
the
blending
of
their
voices
brought
them
closer
his
aloofness
wore
off
and
he
became
an
agreeable
accomplished
companion
whose
merry
wit
and
boyish
sympathy
stirred
emotions
in
the
girl
that
threatened
her
peace
of
mind
this
had
been
the
only
companionship
with
her
own
kind
she
had
enjoyed
for
months
and
with
his
melting
mood
came
a
softening
of
her
own
nature
in
which
she
appeared
before
him
gracious
and
irresistible
banteringly
and
rising
out
of
his
elation
he
tried
to
please
her
and
in
the
same
spirit
that
calls
the
bird
to
its
mate
she
responded
it
was
their
last
hour
together
before
embarking
on
his
perilous
journey
in
search
of
the
golden
fleece
and
his
starved
affections
clamored
for
sympathy
while
the
iron
in
his
blood
felt
the
magnetic
propinquity
of
sex
when
he
said
it
was
with
a
wholly
new
conception
of
his
hostess
and
of
her
power
to
charm
as
well
as
manage
men
and
affairs
but
he
could
well
have
dispensed
with
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
came
over
him
as
he
reviewed
the
events
of
the
evening
over
a
last
pipe
that
he
had
been
playing
with
fire
for
her
part
she
lay
awake
far
into
the
morning
hours
now
blissfully
floating
on
the
current
of
desires
now
vaguely
fearing
some
dread
that
clutched
her
the
were
brief
and
commonplace
there
was
time
for
nothing
more
for
the
dogs
were
straining
to
be
off
and
the
december
air
bit
fiercely
but
cherry
called
emerson
aside
and
in
a
rather
tremulous
voice
begged
him
again
to
consider
well
this
enterprise
before
finally
committing
himself
to
it
if
this
were
any
other
country
if
there
were
any
law
up
here
or
any
certainty
of
getting
a
square
deal
never
say
a
word
i
urge
you
to
go
the
limit
but
he
was
about
to
laugh
off
her
fears
as
he
had
done
before
when
the
plaintive
wrinkle
between
her
brows
and
the
forlorn
droop
of
her
lips
stayed
him
without
thought
of
consequences
and
prompted
largely
by
his
leaping
spirits
he
stooped
and
before
she
could
divine
his
purpose
kissed
her
he
laughed
with
dancing
eyes
that
my
answer
and
the
next
second
was
at
the
sled
the
dogs
leaped
at
his
shout
and
the
cavalcade
was
in
motion
the
others
had
not
observed
his
and
now
cried
a
final
farewell
but
the
girl
stood
without
sound
or
gesture
bareheaded
under
the
wintry
sky
a
startled
wondering
light
in
her
eyes
which
did
not
fade
until
the
men
were
lost
to
view
far
up
the
river
trail
then
she
breathed
deeply
and
turned
into
the
house
oblivious
to
constantine
and
the
young
squaw
who
held
the
sick
baby
up
for
her
inspection
the
hazards
of
winter
travel
in
the
north
are
manifold
at
best
but
the
country
which
emerson
and
his
companions
had
to
traverse
was
particularly
perilous
owing
to
the
fact
that
their
course
led
them
over
the
backbone
of
the
great
alaskan
range
that
desolate
skyscraping
rampart
which
interposes
itself
between
the
hate
of
the
arctic
seas
and
the
tossing
wilderness
of
the
north
pacific
this
range
forms
a
giant
tusk
thrust
out
to
the
westward
and
curved
like
the
horn
of
an
african
rhino
its
tip
pointed
eight
hundred
miles
toward
the
asiatic
coast
its
soaring
peaks
veiled
in
perpetual
mist
and
volcanic
fumes
its
slopes
agleam
with
lonely
it
is
a
ridge
for
the
most
part
narrow
unbroken
and
cruel
and
the
rival
winter
gales
roar
over
it
in
a
war
on
the
north
lies
the
forgotten
land
to
the
south
are
the
tempered
reaches
of
the
pacific
in
summer
the
stern
sweep
of
rock
and
tundra
is
soaked
with
weeping
rains
and
given
over
to
the
herding
caribou
or
the
great
bear
but
when
from
the
polar
regions
the
white
hand
of
winter
stretches
forth
the
grieving
seas
lift
themselves
the
rain
turns
to
bitter
hurricanes
that
charge
and
retreat
in
a
conflict
sheathing
the
barrier
anew
and
confounding
the
hearts
of
men
on
land
and
sea
the
coast
is
unlighted
and
badly
mapped
hence
the
shore
is
a
graveyard
for
ships
while
through
the
guts
which
at
intervals
penetrate
the
range
the
blizzards
screech
until
travellers
burrow
into
drifts
to
avoid
their
fury
or
lie
out
in
stiff
exposed
to
their
anger
it
is
a
region
of
sudden
storms
a
of
the
elements
which
have
swept
it
naked
of
cover
in
ages
past
and
it
is
peopled
scantily
by
handfuls
of
coughing
natives
whose
igloos
are
hidden
in
hollows
or
chained
to
the
ground
with
cables
and
ship
gear
it
was
thither
the
travellers
were
bound
headed
toward
katmai
pass
which
is
no
more
than
a
gap
between
peaks
through
which
the
hibernal
gales
suck
and
swirl
this
pass
is
even
balder
than
the
surrounding
barrens
for
it
forms
a
funnel
at
each
end
confining
the
winds
and
affording
them
freer
course
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
had
an
appalling
and
was
religiously
shunned
emerson
would
hearken
to
no
argument
for
a
safer
route
insisting
that
they
could
spare
no
time
for
detours
nothing
dampened
his
spirits
no
hardship
daunted
him
he
was
tireless
ferocious
in
his
haste
a
week
of
hard
travel
found
them
camped
in
the
last
fringe
of
cottonwood
that
fronted
the
glacial
slopes
their
number
augmented
now
by
a
native
from
a
russian
village
with
an
unpronounceable
name
who
at
the
price
of
an
extortionate
bribe
had
agreed
to
pilot
them
through
for
three
days
they
lay
idle
the
taut
walls
of
their
tent
thrumming
to
an
incessant
fusillade
of
ice
particles
that
whirled
down
ahead
of
the
blast
while
emerson
fumed
to
be
gone
the
fourth
morning
broke
still
and
quiet
but
after
a
careful
scrutiny
of
the
peaks
the
indian
shook
his
head
and
spoke
to
balt
who
nodded
in
agreement
what
the
matter
growled
emerson
why
do
we
get
under
way
but
the
other
replied
not
them
tips
are
smoking
see
he
indicated
certain
gauzy
streamers
that
floated
like
vapor
from
the
highest
pinnacles
snow
dry
snow
and
it
shows
that
the
wind
is
blowing
up
there
we
dassent
tackle
it
do
you
mean
we
must
lie
here
waiting
for
an
absolutely
calm
day
exactly
why
it
may
be
a
week
it
may
be
two
of
them
then
again
it
may
be
all
right
nonsense
that
breeze
wo
hurt
anybody
breeze
balt
laughed
it
more
like
a
tornado
up
yonder
no
just
got
to
take
it
easy
till
the
right
moment
comes
and
then
make
a
dash
it
thirty
miles
to
the
nearest
stick
of
timber
and
once
you
get
into
the
pass
you
ca
stop
till
you
through
still
unconvinced
and
surly
at
the
delay
emerson
resigned
himself
while
balt
saw
to
their
sled
tended
the
dogs
and
made
final
preparations
fingerless
fraser
lay
flat
on
his
back
and
nursed
a
pair
of
swollen
tendons
that
had
been
galled
by
his
snowshoe
thongs
reviling
at
the
fortune
that
had
cast
him
into
such
inhospitable
surroundings
heaping
anathemas
upon
the
head
of
him
who
had
invented
snowshoes
complaining
of
everything
in
general
from
the
indigestible
quality
of
bread
to
the
odor
of
the
guide
who
crouched
stolidly
beside
the
stove
feeding
it
with
green
willows
and
twisted
withes
the
next
dawn
showed
the
mountain
peaks
limned
like
ivory
against
the
sky
and
as
they
crept
up
through
the
defiles
the
air
was
so
motionless
that
the
smoke
of
their
pipes
hung
about
their
heads
while
the
creak
of
their
soles
upon
the
dry
surface
of
the
snow
roused
echoes
from
the
walls
on
either
side
at
first
their
progress
was
rapid
but
in
time
the
drifts
grew
deeper
and
they
came
to
bluffs
where
they
were
forced
to
notch
footholds
unpack
their
load
and
relay
it
to
the
top
then
free
the
dogs
and
haul
the
sled
up
with
a
rope
hand
over
hand
these
labors
besides
being
intensely
fatiguing
delayed
them
considerably
added
to
which
the
higher
altitudes
were
covered
with
a
soft
that
reached
nearly
to
their
knees
and
shoved
ahead
of
the
sled
in
great
masses
thus
they
dragged
their
burden
through
instead
of
over
it
by
they
had
gained
the
summit
and
found
themselves
in
the
heart
of
a
huge
desolation
hedged
in
by
a
chaos
of
peaks
and
pinnacles
the
snows
unbroken
by
twig
or
bush
untracked
by
living
sign
here
and
there
the
dark
face
of
some
rock
or
cliff
scowled
at
them
and
although
they
were
drenched
with
sweat
and
parched
from
thirst
nowhere
was
there
the
faintest
tinkle
of
running
water
while
the
dry
powder
under
foot
scratched
their
throats
like
iron
filings
when
they
turned
to
it
for
relief
all
were
jaded
and
silent
save
emerson
who
urged
them
on
incessantly
it
was
early
in
the
afternoon
when
the
indian
stopped
and
began
testing
the
air
balt
also
seemed
suddenly
to
scent
a
change
in
the
atmospheric
conditions
what
wrong
now
emerson
asked
gruffly
feels
like
wind
answered
the
big
man
with
a
shake
of
his
head
the
native
began
to
chatter
excitedly
and
as
they
stood
there
a
chill
draught
fanned
their
cheeks
glancing
upward
at
the
hillsides
they
saw
that
the
air
was
now
thickened
as
if
by
smoke
and
dropping
their
eyes
they
saw
the
fluff
beneath
their
feet
stir
lazily
little
wisps
of
began
to
dance
upon
the
ridges
whisking
out
of
sight
as
suddenly
as
they
appeared
they
became
conscious
of
a
sudden
fall
in
the
temperature
and
they
knew
that
the
cold
of
interstellar
space
dwelt
in
that
ghostly
breath
which
smote
them
before
they
were
well
aware
of
the
ominous
significance
of
these
signs
the
storm
was
upon
them
sweeping
through
the
chute
wherein
they
stood
with
rapidly
increasing
violence
the
terrible
unseen
hand
of
the
frozen
north
had
unleashed
its
brood
of
furies
and
the
air
rang
with
their
hideous
cries
it
was
dante
third
circle
of
hell
let
loose
cerberus
baying
through
his
wide
threefold
throat
and
the
voices
of
tormented
souls
shrilling
through
the
infernal
shades
it
came
from
behind
them
lifting
the
fur
on
the
backs
of
the
and
filling
it
with
powder
pelting
their
hides
with
sharp
particles
until
they
refused
to
stand
before
it
and
turned
and
crouched
with
flattened
ears
in
the
shelter
of
the
sled
in
an
instant
the
wet
faces
of
the
men
were
dried
and
their
steaming
garments
hardened
to
shells
while
their
blood
began
to
move
more
sluggishly
fraser
shouted
something
but
emerson
whipping
garments
drowned
the
words
and
without
waiting
to
ascertain
what
the
adventurer
had
said
the
young
man
ran
forward
and
cut
the
dogs
loose
while
balt
and
the
guide
fell
to
unlashing
the
sled
the
tails
of
their
parkas
meanwhile
snapping
like
boat
sails
their
cap
strings
streaming
as
they
freed
the
last
knot
the
hurricane
ripped
the
edge
of
the
tarpaulin
from
their
clumsy
fingers
and
seizing
a
loosely
folded
blanket
belonging
to
the
native
snatched
it
away
the
fellow
clutched
wildly
at
it
but
the
cloth
sailed
ahead
of
the
blast
as
if
on
wings
then
dropping
to
the
surface
of
the
snow
opened
out
whereupon
some
twisting
current
bore
it
aloft
again
and
it
swooped
down
the
hill
like
a
great
bat
followed
by
a
wail
of
despair
from
the
owner
other
loose
articles
on
the
top
of
the
load
were
picked
up
like
chaff
coffee
pot
frying
pan
and
dishes
then
hurtled
away
like
charges
of
canister
rolling
leaping
skipping
down
into
the
swale
ahead
then
up
over
the
next
ridge
and
out
of
sight
but
the
men
were
too
fiercely
beset
by
the
confusion
to
notice
their
loss
there
was
no
question
of
facing
the
wind
for
it
was
more
cruel
than
the
fierce
breath
of
an
open
furnace
searing
the
naked
flesh
like
a
flame
all
the
morning
the
air
had
hung
in
perfect
poise
but
some
change
of
temperature
away
out
over
one
of
the
rival
oceans
had
upset
the
aerostatic
balance
and
the
wind
tore
through
this
gap
like
the
torrent
below
a
broken
reservoir
the
contour
of
the
surrounding
hills
altered
the
whole
country
took
on
a
different
aspect
due
to
the
rapid
charging
of
the
atmosphere
the
limits
of
vision
grew
shorter
and
strangely
distorted
although
as
yet
the
snows
were
barely
beginning
to
move
the
men
knew
they
would
shortly
be
forced
to
grope
their
way
through
dense
clouds
that
would
blot
out
every
landmark
and
the
touch
of
which
would
be
like
the
stroke
of
a
rasp
balt
came
close
to
emerson
and
bellowed
into
his
ear
what
shall
we
do
roll
up
in
the
bedding
or
run
for
it
how
far
is
it
to
timber
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
let
run
for
it
we
out
of
grub
anyhow
and
this
may
last
for
days
there
was
no
use
of
trying
to
secure
additional
clothing
from
the
supply
in
the
sled
so
they
abandoned
their
outfit
and
allowed
themselves
to
be
driven
ahead
of
the
storm
trusting
to
the
sense
of
direction
and
keeping
close
together
the
dogs
were
already
well
drifted
over
and
refused
to
stir
once
they
were
gone
a
stone
throw
from
the
sled
there
was
no
turning
back
and
although
the
wind
was
behind
them
progress
was
difficult
for
they
came
upon
chasms
which
they
had
to
avoid
they
crossed
slippery
slopes
where
the
storm
had
bared
the
hard
crust
and
which
their
feet
refused
to
grip
in
such
places
they
had
to
creep
on
hands
and
knees
calling
to
one
another
for
guidance
they
were
numbed
blinded
choked
by
the
rage
of
the
blizzard
their
faces
grew
stiff
and
their
lungs
froze
at
times
they
fell
and
were
skidded
along
ahead
of
the
blasts
this
forced
them
to
crawl
back
again
for
they
dared
not
lose
their
course
at
one
place
they
followed
a
where
the
rocks
came
to
a
sharp
ridge
like
the
summit
of
a
roof
this
they
bestrode
inching
along
a
foot
at
a
time
wearing
through
the
palms
of
their
mittens
and
chafing
their
garments
no
cloth
could
withstand
the
roughened
surfaces
and
in
time
the
bare
flesh
of
their
hands
became
exposed
but
there
was
little
sensation
and
no
time
for
rest
or
means
of
relief
soon
they
began
to
leave
blood
stains
behind
them
all
four
men
were
old
in
the
ways
of
the
north
and
knowing
their
present
extremity
they
steeled
themselves
to
suffering
but
their
tortures
were
intense
not
the
least
of
which
was
thirst
exhaustion
comes
quickly
under
such
conditions
much
has
been
written
concerning
the
red
man
physical
powers
of
endurance
but
as
a
rule
no
indian
is
the
equal
of
his
white
brother
due
as
much
perhaps
to
lack
of
mental
force
as
to
generations
of
insufficient
clothing
and
inanition
so
it
was
not
surprising
that
as
the
long
afternoon
dragged
to
a
close
the
aleut
guide
began
to
weaken
he
paused
with
more
frequency
and
it
required
more
effort
to
start
him
he
fell
oftener
and
rose
with
more
difficulty
but
the
others
were
dependent
upon
his
knowledge
of
the
trail
and
could
not
take
the
lead
darkness
found
them
staggering
on
supporting
him
wherever
possible
at
length
he
became
unable
to
guide
them
farther
and
balt
who
had
once
made
the
trip
took
his
place
while
the
others
dragged
the
poor
creature
along
at
the
cost
of
their
precious
strength
at
one
time
he
begged
them
to
leave
him
and
both
balt
and
fingerless
fraser
agreed
but
emerson
would
have
none
of
it
he
die
anyhow
argued
the
fisherman
he
as
good
as
dead
now
supplemented
fraser
and
we
may
be
ten
miles
from
timber
i
made
him
come
and
i
take
him
through
said
emerson
stubbornly
and
so
they
crawled
their
weary
way
sore
beset
with
their
dragging
burden
slow
at
best
their
advance
now
became
for
darkness
had
fallen
and
threatened
to
blot
them
out
it
betrayed
them
down
declivities
up
and
out
of
which
they
had
to
dig
their
way
in
such
descents
they
were
forced
to
let
go
the
helpless
man
whose
body
rolled
ahead
of
them
like
a
boneless
sack
but
these
very
mishaps
helped
to
keep
the
spark
of
life
in
him
for
at
every
disheartening
pause
the
others
rubbed
and
pounded
him
though
they
knew
that
their
efforts
were
hopeless
and
would
have
been
better
spent
upon
themselves
fraser
never
a
strong
man
gave
out
in
time
and
it
looked
as
if
he
might
overtax
the
powers
of
the
other
two
but
balt
strength
was
that
of
a
bull
while
emerson
subsisted
on
his
nerve
fairly
consuming
his
soul
they
grew
faint
and
sick
and
knew
themselves
to
be
badly
frozen
but
their
leader
spurred
them
on
draining
himself
in
the
effort
for
the
first
time
emerson
realized
that
the
adventurer
had
been
a
drag
on
him
ever
since
their
meeting
they
had
long
since
lost
all
track
of
time
and
place
trusting
blindly
to
a
downward
course
the
hurricane
still
harried
them
with
unabated
fury
when
all
at
once
they
came
to
another
bluff
where
the
ground
fell
away
abruptly
without
waiting
to
investigate
whether
the
slope
terminated
in
a
drift
or
a
precipice
they
flung
themselves
over
down
they
floundered
the
two
men
tangled
together
as
if
in
a
race
for
total
oblivion
only
to
plunge
through
a
thicket
of
willow
tops
that
whipped
and
stung
them
on
they
went
now
vastly
heartened
over
another
ridge
down
another
declivity
and
then
into
a
grove
of
spruce
timber
where
the
air
suddenly
stilled
and
only
the
told
of
the
rushing
wind
above
it
was
an
hour
before
balt
and
emerson
succeeded
in
starting
a
fire
for
it
was
desperate
work
groping
for
dry
branches
and
they
themselves
were
on
the
verge
of
collapse
before
the
timid
blaze
finally
showed
the
two
more
unfortunate
ones
huddled
together
cherry
had
given
emerson
a
flask
of
liquor
before
starting
and
this
he
now
divided
between
fraser
and
the
guide
having
wisely
refused
it
to
them
until
shelter
was
secured
then
he
melted
snow
in
balt
tin
cup
and
poured
pints
of
hot
water
into
the
pair
until
the
adventurer
began
to
rally
but
the
aleut
was
too
far
gone
and
an
hour
before
the
laggard
dawn
came
he
died
they
walked
fraser
around
the
fire
all
night
threshing
his
tortured
body
and
fighting
off
their
own
deadly
weariness
meanwhile
absorbing
the
insufficient
heat
of
the
flames
when
daylight
came
they
tried
hard
to
lash
the
corpse
into
a
but
their
strength
was
unequal
to
the
task
and
they
were
forced
to
leave
the
body
to
the
mercy
of
the
wolves
as
they
turned
their
faces
expectantly
down
the
valley
toward
the
village
the
day
was
well
spent
when
they
struggled
into
katmai
and
plodded
up
to
a
log
store
the
roof
of
which
was
protected
from
the
winter
gales
by
two
anchor
chains
passed
over
the
ridge
and
made
fast
to
posts
well
buried
in
the
ground
a
globular
russian
trader
with
eyes
so
crossed
that
he
could
distinguish
nothing
at
a
yard
distance
took
them
in
and
administered
to
their
most
crying
needs
then
dispatched
an
outfit
for
the
guide
body
the
initial
stage
of
the
journey
emerson
realized
with
thanksgiving
was
over
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
talk
he
inquired
straightway
concerning
the
she
called
here
three
days
ago
bound
west
said
the
trader
that
all
right
she
be
back
in
about
a
week
eh
no
she
wo
stop
here
coming
back
her
contract
do
call
for
it
what
emerson
felt
himself
sickening
no
she
wo
call
here
till
next
month
and
then
if
it
storming
she
go
on
to
the
westward
and
land
on
her
way
back
how
long
will
that
be
maybe
seven
or
eight
weeks
in
his
weakened
condition
the
young
man
groped
for
the
counter
to
support
himself
so
the
storm
delay
at
the
foot
of
the
pass
had
undone
him
fate
in
the
guise
of
winter
had
unfurled
those
floating
from
the
mountain
peaks
to
thwart
him
once
more
instead
of
losing
the
accursed
thing
that
had
hung
over
him
these
past
three
years
it
had
merely
redoubled
its
hold
that
mocking
power
had
held
the
bait
of
tantalus
before
his
eyes
only
to
hurl
him
back
into
hopeless
despair
for
figuring
with
the
utmost
nicety
he
had
reckoned
that
there
was
just
time
to
execute
his
mission
and
even
a
delay
would
mean
certain
failure
he
turned
hopelessly
toward
his
two
companions
but
fraser
had
relapsed
into
a
state
of
coma
while
big
george
was
asleep
beside
the
stove
for
a
long
time
he
stood
silent
and
musing
while
the
fat
storekeeper
regarded
him
stupidly
then
he
fumbled
with
clumsy
fingers
at
his
breast
and
produced
the
folded
page
of
a
magazine
he
held
it
for
a
time
without
opening
it
then
crushed
it
slowly
in
his
fist
and
flung
the
crumpled
ball
into
the
open
coals
he
sighed
heavily
and
turned
upon
the
trader
a
countenance
out
of
which
all
the
light
had
gone
give
us
beds
he
said
we
want
to
sleep
chapter
vii
and
neptune
takes
another
out
of
consideration
for
his
companions
emerson
did
not
acquaint
them
with
the
evil
tidings
until
the
next
morning
moreover
he
was
swallowed
up
in
black
despair
and
had
no
heart
left
in
him
for
any
further
exertion
he
had
allowed
the
russian
to
show
him
to
a
bed
upon
which
he
flung
himself
half
dressed
while
the
others
followed
suit
but
he
was
too
tired
to
sleep
his
nerves
had
been
filed
to
such
a
fine
edge
that
slumber
became
a
process
which
required
long
hours
of
coaxing
during
which
he
tossed
restlessly
a
prey
to
those
hideous
nightmares
that
lurk
on
the
of
dreams
his
distorted
imagination
flung
him
again
and
again
into
the
agonizing
maelstrom
of
the
last
hours
and
in
his
waking
moments
the
gaunt
spectre
of
failure
haunted
him
this
was
no
new
apparition
but
never
before
had
it
appeared
so
horrible
as
now
he
was
too
worn
out
to
rave
his
strength
was
spent
and
his
mind
wandered
hither
and
thither
like
a
rudderless
ship
so
he
lay
staring
into
the
dark
with
dull
tragic
eyes
utterly
inert
his
body
racked
by
a
thousand
pains
nor
did
fingerless
fraser
meet
with
better
fortune
he
found
little
rest
or
sleep
and
burdened
the
night
with
his
groanings
his
condition
called
for
the
frequent
attendance
of
the
trader
who
ministered
to
his
needs
with
the
ease
and
certainty
of
long
practice
rousing
him
now
and
then
to
give
him
nourishment
and
redressing
his
frozen
members
when
necessary
as
for
balt
he
slept
like
an
eskimo
dog
wrapped
in
the
senseless
trance
of
complete
physical
relaxation
being
a
creature
of
no
imagination
he
had
taxed
nothing
beyond
his
body
which
was
capable
of
tremendous
resistance
wherefore
he
escaped
the
torment
and
mental
distress
of
the
others
as
warmth
and
repose
gradually
adjusted
the
balance
between
mind
and
body
emerson
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
and
it
was
late
in
the
day
when
he
awoke
every
muscle
aching
every
joint
stiff
every
step
attended
with
pain
he
found
his
companions
up
and
already
breakfasted
big
george
none
the
worse
for
his
ordeal
while
fraser
bandaged
and
smarting
was
his
old
shrewd
self
emerson
first
inquiry
was
for
the
body
of
the
guide
they
brought
him
in
this
morning
answered
the
fisherman
he
in
cold
storage
at
the
church
when
the
priest
comes
over
next
month
they
bury
him
he
was
a
right
nice
feller
said
fraser
but
i
glad
i
ai
in
his
mukluks
if
you
two
had
stuck
to
me
well
him
and
me
would
have
done
a
brother
act
at
this
church
festival
how
are
your
emerson
asked
seating
himself
with
painful
care
fine
all
but
the
bum
hook
he
held
up
his
crippled
hand
which
was
well
bandaged
however
i
guess
i
can
save
my
so
all
is
not
lost
have
you
heard
about
the
no
we
missed
her
what
mean
demanded
big
george
blankly
i
mean
that
the
storm
delayed
us
just
long
enough
to
ruin
us
why
er
let
wait
till
the
next
trip
offered
the
fisherman
emerson
shook
his
head
she
may
not
be
back
here
for
eight
weeks
no
we
done
for
balt
was
like
a
big
boy
in
distress
his
face
wrinkled
as
if
he
were
about
to
burst
into
loud
lamentations
then
a
thought
seized
him
i
tell
you
what
we
do
he
cried
with
a
heavy
attempt
at
meeting
the
problem
we
put
off
the
scheme
for
a
year
we
take
plenty
of
time
and
open
up
a
year
from
next
spring
no
said
emerson
with
a
dejected
shake
of
the
head
if
i
ca
put
it
through
on
the
flash
i
ca
do
it
at
all
my
time
is
up
i
down
and
out
all
our
pretty
plans
have
gone
to
smash
you
better
go
back
to
kalvik
george
at
this
suggestion
balt
rose
ponderously
and
began
to
rave
to
see
his
vengeance
slip
from
his
grasp
enraged
him
he
cursed
shockingly
clinching
his
great
fists
above
his
head
and
grinding
forth
imprecations
which
caused
fraser
to
quail
and
cry
out
aghast
hey
you
quit
that
want
to
hang
a
jonah
onto
us
but
the
fisherman
only
goaded
himself
into
a
greater
passion
during
which
petellin
the
storekeeper
entered
and
forthwith
began
to
cross
himself
devoutly
observing
this
fervent
pantomime
balt
turned
upon
the
trader
and
directed
his
outburst
at
him
where
in
hell
is
this
steamer
out
to
the
westward
somewhere
well
she
a
ai
she
then
why
do
she
stop
here
coming
back
answer
me
the
rotund
man
shrugged
his
fat
shoulders
she
got
to
call
at
uyak
bay
going
east
emerson
looked
up
quickly
where
is
uyak
bay
over
on
kodiak
island
big
george
answered
then
turned
again
to
vent
his
spleen
on
the
trader
what
right
have
them
steamboat
people
got
to
cut
out
this
place
for
an
empty
cannery
why
there
ai
nobody
at
uyak
it
more
of
that
damned
company
business
they
own
this
whole
country
and
run
it
to
suit
themselves
she
ai
my
boat
said
petellin
you
ought
to
have
got
here
a
few
days
sooner
my
god
i
sorry
we
waited
at
the
pass
said
emerson
the
weather
could
have
been
any
worse
that
first
day
than
it
was
when
we
came
across
detecting
in
this
remark
a
criticism
of
his
caution
big
george
turned
about
and
faced
the
speaker
but
as
he
met
emerson
eye
he
checked
the
explosion
and
seizing
his
cap
bolted
out
into
the
cold
to
walk
off
his
mad
rage
when
is
the
boat
due
at
uyak
emerson
asked
any
time
inside
of
a
week
how
far
is
that
from
here
it
ai
so
far
only
about
fifty
miles
then
catching
the
light
that
flamed
into
the
miner
eyes
petellin
hastened
to
observe
but
you
ca
get
there
it
across
the
straits
shelikof
straits
what
of
that
we
can
hire
a
and
i
ai
got
any
i
lost
my
sloop
last
year
hunting
we
can
hire
a
small
boat
of
sort
ca
we
and
get
the
natives
to
put
us
across
there
must
be
plenty
of
boats
here
nothing
but
skin
boats
kyaks
and
bidarkas
you
know
anyhow
you
could
cross
at
this
time
of
year
it
too
stormy
these
straits
is
the
worst
piece
of
water
on
the
coast
no
you
have
to
wait
emerson
sank
back
into
his
chair
and
stared
hopelessly
at
the
fire
better
have
some
breakfast
the
trader
continued
but
the
other
only
shook
his
head
and
after
a
farewell
squint
of
curiosity
the
fat
man
rolled
out
again
in
pursuit
of
his
duties
i
heard
tell
of
these
shelikof
straits
fraser
remarked
i
bunked
with
a
from
kodiak
once
and
he
said
they
was
certainly
some
hell
in
winter
when
emerson
made
no
reply
the
colorless
eyes
settled
upon
him
with
a
trace
of
solicitude
and
he
resumed
i
doggone
sorry
you
lost
out
pal
but
mebbe
turn
up
yet
then
seeing
that
the
young
man
was
deaf
to
his
condolence
he
muttered
so
you
got
again
eh
um
as
usual
on
such
occasions
he
fell
into
his
old
habit
of
reading
aloud
as
it
were
an
imaginary
scene
to
himself
i
got
again
says
emerson
always
eager
to
give
entertainment
with
the
english
language
am
indeed
blue
this
afternoon
wo
you
talk
to
me
i
feel
that
the
sound
of
a
dear
friend
voice
will
drive
dull
care
away
says
i
am
a
silent
man
by
birth
and
training
and
my
thoughts
is
jewels
but
for
you
i
scatter
them
at
large
and
you
can
take
your
pick
now
this
salmon
business
ai
what
it
cracked
up
to
be
after
all
it
a
smelly
proposition
no
matter
how
you
take
it
and
a
fisherman
ai
much
better
than
a
reub
ask
any
wise
guy
i
rather
see
you
in
some
profesh
that
do
stink
so
like
selling
scented
soap
there
was
a
feller
at
dyea
who
done
well
at
it
what
think
you
a
dark
night
without
says
emerson
i
fear
some
mischief
is
afoot
what
of
yonder
beauteous
unheeding
this
chatter
the
disheartened
man
got
up
at
this
juncture
as
if
a
sudden
thought
impelled
him
and
followed
balt
out
into
the
cold
he
turned
down
the
bank
to
the
creek
however
and
made
a
careful
examination
of
all
the
canoes
that
went
with
the
village
fifteen
minutes
later
he
had
searched
out
the
disgruntled
fisherman
and
cried
excitedly
i
got
it
we
catch
that
boat
yet
how
growled
the
big
man
sourly
there
a
large
open
an
oomiak
down
on
the
beach
hire
a
crew
of
indians
to
put
us
across
to
uyak
ca
be
done
said
big
george
still
gruffly
it
the
wrong
season
you
know
the
shelikof
straits
is
a
bad
place
even
for
steamships
at
this
time
of
year
they
like
that
pass
up
yonder
only
worse
but
it
only
fifty
miles
across
fifty
miles
of
that
kind
of
water
in
an
open
canoe
may
be
just
as
bad
as
five
hundred
unless
you
lucky
and
i
ai
noticed
anything
so
damned
lucky
about
us
well
it
that
or
nothing
it
our
only
chance
are
you
game
come
on
cried
big
george
let
find
petellin
when
that
worthy
heard
their
desire
he
uttered
a
shriek
of
denial
in
summer
yes
but
now
you
ca
do
it
it
has
been
tried
too
often
the
straits
is
always
rough
and
the
weather
is
too
cold
to
sit
all
day
in
an
oomiak
you
freeze
we
chance
it
no
no
if
it
comes
on
to
storm
you
go
to
sea
the
tides
are
strong
you
ca
see
your
course
and
we
use
a
compass
now
you
get
me
enough
men
to
handle
that
oomiak
that
a
good
fellow
i
attend
to
the
rest
but
they
wo
go
declared
the
little
fat
man
they
know
what
it
means
why
call
them
in
i
do
the
talking
and
accordingly
the
storekeeper
went
in
search
of
the
village
chief
shaking
his
head
and
muttering
at
the
madness
of
these
people
fingerless
fraser
noticing
the
change
in
balt
and
emerson
when
they
the
store
questioned
them
as
to
what
had
happened
and
in
reply
to
his
inquiry
big
george
said
we
going
to
tackle
the
straits
in
a
small
boat
what
not
on
your
life
why
that
the
craziest
stunt
i
ever
heard
of
do
you
know
yes
we
know
emerson
shut
him
up
brusquely
you
do
have
to
go
with
us
well
i
should
say
not
hunh
do
i
look
like
i
do
a
thing
like
that
if
i
do
it
because
i
sick
i
just
got
this
far
by
a
eyelash
and
hereinafter
i
take
the
best
of
it
every
time
you
can
wait
for
the
i
certainly
can
and
what
more
i
will
and
i
register
myself
too
there
ai
goin
to
be
any
accidents
to
me
whatever
although
the
two
men
were
pleased
at
the
remote
chance
of
catching
the
steamer
their
ardor
received
a
serious
when
the
trader
came
in
with
the
head
man
of
the
village
and
a
handful
of
hunters
for
emerson
found
that
money
was
quite
powerless
to
tempt
them
using
the
russian
as
interpreter
he
coaxed
and
wheedled
increasing
his
offer
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
exigencies
of
the
occasion
and
still
finding
them
obdurate
in
despair
he
piled
every
coin
he
owned
upon
the
counter
but
the
men
only
shook
their
heads
and
palavered
among
themselves
they
say
it
too
cold
translated
petellin
they
will
freeze
and
money
is
no
good
to
dead
men
another
native
spoke
is
very
stormy
this
month
they
say
waves
would
sink
an
open
boat
then
they
can
put
us
across
in
bidarkas
insisted
emerson
who
had
noted
the
presence
of
several
of
these
smaller
crafts
which
are
nothing
more
than
long
canoes
completely
decked
over
save
for
tiny
cockpits
wherein
the
paddlers
sit
they
do
have
to
come
back
that
way
they
can
wait
at
uyak
for
the
next
trip
of
the
steamer
why
i
offering
them
more
pay
than
they
can
make
in
ten
years
better
get
them
to
do
it
urged
big
george
you
get
the
coin
all
back
from
them
they
have
to
trade
here
but
petellin
arguments
were
as
ineffective
as
emerson
and
after
an
hour
futile
haggling
the
natives
were
about
to
leave
when
emerson
said
ask
them
what
they
take
to
sell
me
a
bidarka
one
hundred
dollars
petellin
told
him
after
an
instant
parley
emerson
turned
to
george
will
you
tackle
it
alone
with
me
the
fisherman
hesitated
two
of
us
could
make
it
get
a
third
man
and
i
go
you
accordingly
emerson
resumed
the
subject
with
the
indians
but
now
their
answer
was
short
and
decisive
not
one
of
them
would
venture
forth
unless
accompanied
by
one
of
his
own
kind
in
whose
endurance
and
skill
with
a
paddle
he
had
confidence
it
seemed
as
if
fate
had
laid
one
final
insurmountable
obstacle
in
the
path
of
the
two
white
men
when
fingerless
fraser
who
had
been
a
silent
witness
of
the
whole
scene
spoke
up
in
his
voice
a
bitter
complaint
well
that
puts
it
up
to
me
i
suppose
i
always
the
fall
guy
damn
it
you
go
cried
emerson
astounded
beyond
measure
at
this
offer
and
still
doubting
the
fellow
had
so
consistently
shirked
every
hardship
and
so
systematically
refused
every
hazard
no
matter
how
slight
well
i
do
to
fraser
flared
up
you
can
just
lay
a
bet
on
that
but
these
siwashes
wo
stand
the
gaff
they
too
wise
so
i
to
ai
i
he
glared
belligerently
from
one
to
the
other
can
you
handle
a
boat
demanded
big
george
can
i
handle
a
hunh
sniffed
the
fellow
say
just
because
got
corns
on
your
palms
as
big
as
pancakes
you
need
think
the
only
human
that
ever
pulled
an
oar
i
was
the
first
man
through
miles
canon
during
the
big
rush
in
i
ran
the
rapids
for
a
living
i
got
fifty
dollars
a
trip
and
it
only
took
me
three
minutes
by
the
watch
that
was
the
only
easy
money
i
ever
picked
up
why
them
tenderfeet
used
to
cry
like
babies
when
they
got
a
peek
at
them
rapids
can
i
handle
a
b
yes
and
i
wish
i
was
back
there
right
now
instead
of
hitched
up
with
a
pair
of
yaps
that
do
know
when
they
well
off
but
look
here
fraser
emerson
spoke
up
i
do
think
you
are
strong
enough
for
this
trip
it
may
take
us
hours
of
constant
paddling
against
wind
and
tide
to
make
uyak
george
and
i
are
fit
enough
but
you
know
you
are
fingerless
fraser
turned
violently
upon
the
speaker
now
for
heaven
sake
cut
that
out
will
you
just
because
you
happened
to
give
me
a
little
lift
on
this
cussed
katmai
pass
i
you
never
get
done
throwing
it
up
to
me
my
feet
were
sore
why
i
petered
out
if
it
had
been
for
my
bum
i
have
walked
both
of
you
down
but
they
were
sore
ca
you
understand
feet
were
he
was
whining
now
and
this
unexpected
angle
of
the
man
disposition
completely
confused
the
others
and
left
them
rather
at
a
loss
what
to
say
but
before
they
could
make
any
comment
he
rose
stiffly
and
blazed
forth
but
i
wo
start
i
hurt
too
much
and
my
mits
is
froze
if
you
want
to
wait
till
i
healed
up
so
i
can
die
in
comfort
why
go
ahead
and
buy
that
boat
and
we
all
commit
suicide
together
he
stumped
indignantly
out
of
the
room
his
friends
too
greatly
dumfounded
even
to
smile
for
the
next
two
days
the
men
rested
replenishing
their
strength
but
fraser
developed
a
wolfish
temper
which
turned
him
into
a
veritable
chestnut
burr
there
was
no
handling
him
his
scars
were
not
deep
nor
his
hurts
serious
however
so
by
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
he
announced
with
surly
distemper
that
he
would
be
ready
to
leave
on
the
following
morning
and
the
others
accordingly
made
preparation
for
an
early
start
they
selected
the
most
seaworthy
canoe
which
at
best
was
a
treacherous
craft
and
stocked
it
well
with
water
cooked
food
and
stimulants
since
their
arrival
at
katmai
the
weather
had
continued
calm
and
although
the
view
they
had
through
the
frowning
headlands
showed
the
straits
black
and
angry
they
prayed
that
the
wind
would
hold
off
for
another
hours
again
petellin
importuned
them
to
forego
this
journey
and
again
they
turned
deaf
ears
to
his
entreaties
and
retired
early
to
awaken
with
the
rickety
log
store
straining
at
its
cables
under
the
force
of
a
blizzard
that
had
blotted
out
the
mountains
and
was
rousing
the
sea
to
fury
fraser
openly
rejoiced
and
heavy
brows
which
had
carried
a
weight
of
trouble
cleared
but
emerson
was
plunged
into
as
black
a
mood
as
that
of
the
storm
which
had
swallowed
up
the
landscape
for
three
days
the
tempest
held
them
prisoners
then
died
as
suddenly
as
it
had
arisen
but
the
surf
continued
to
thunder
upon
the
beach
for
many
hours
while
emerson
looked
on
with
hopeless
sullen
eyes
when
at
last
they
did
set
out
a
week
to
a
day
from
their
arrival
at
katmai
it
was
to
find
such
a
heavy
sea
running
outside
the
capes
that
they
had
hard
shift
to
make
it
back
to
the
village
drenched
dispirited
and
dead
from
the
cold
and
fatigue
although
fraser
had
fully
recovered
from
his
collapse
he
nevertheless
complained
upon
every
occasion
and
whined
loudly
at
every
ache
he
voiced
his
tortures
eloquently
and
bewailed
the
fate
that
had
brought
his
fortunes
to
such
an
ebb
burdening
the
air
so
heavily
with
his
complaints
that
big
george
broke
out
in
exasperation
shut
up
you
do
have
to
go
with
us
i
rather
tackle
it
alone
than
listen
to
you
that
right
agreed
emerson
whose
patience
was
also
worn
out
by
the
rogue
unceasing
jeremiad
we
try
it
without
him
oh
you
will
will
you
snorted
fraser
indignantly
so
after
me
getting
well
on
purpose
to
make
this
trip
you
want
to
dump
me
here
with
this
fat
man
i
stand
as
much
as
anybody
but
i
wo
stand
for
no
deal
like
that
no
sir
you
said
i
could
go
and
i
going
why
i
rather
drown
than
stick
in
this
burgh
with
that
greasy
russian
porpoise
gee
this
is
a
shine
village
then
take
your
medicine
like
a
man
and
quit
kicking
if
you
prefer
to
swallow
your
groans
you
do
it
i
like
to
make
a
fuss
when
i
suffer
i
enjoy
it
more
that
way
again
petellin
called
them
at
daylight
and
they
were
off
this
time
with
better
success
for
the
waves
had
abated
sufficiently
for
them
to
venture
beyond
the
partial
shelter
of
the
bay
all
three
knew
the
desperate
chance
they
were
taking
and
they
spoke
little
as
they
made
their
way
out
into
the
straits
their
craft
was
strange
to
them
and
the
positions
they
were
forced
to
occupy
soon
brought
on
cramped
muscles
the
bidarka
is
a
frail
narrow
framework
over
which
is
stretched
walrus
skin
and
it
is
so
fashioned
that
the
crew
sits
one
behind
the
other
in
circular
openings
with
legs
straight
out
in
front
to
keep
themselves
dry
each
man
had
donned
a
native
water
garment
a
loose
hooded
shirt
manufactured
from
the
bladders
of
seals
these
shirts
or
kamlikas
as
they
are
called
are
provided
with
at
wrists
face
and
bottom
so
that
when
the
skirt
is
stretched
over
the
rim
of
the
cockpit
and
corded
tight
it
renders
the
canoe
waterproof
even
though
the
decks
are
awash
the
whole
contrivance
is
peculiarly
aboriginal
and
unsuited
to
the
uses
of
white
men
and
while
unusually
seaworthy
the
bidarka
requires
more
skill
in
the
handling
than
does
a
canadian
birch
bark
hence
the
wits
of
the
three
travellers
were
taxed
to
the
utmost
out
across
the
lonesome
waste
they
journeyed
steadily
creeping
farther
from
the
village
which
of
a
sudden
seemed
a
very
safe
and
desirable
place
with
its
snug
store
its
blazing
fires
and
its
warm
beds
the
sea
tossed
them
like
a
cork
coating
their
paddles
and
the
decks
of
the
canoe
with
ice
which
they
were
at
great
pains
to
break
off
it
wet
them
in
spite
of
their
precautions
and
its
salt
breath
searched
out
their
marrow
regardless
of
their
unceasing
labors
and
these
labors
were
in
truth
unceasing
for
fifty
miles
of
open
water
lay
before
them
fifty
miles
which
meant
twelve
hours
of
steady
paddling
gradually
imperceptibly
the
mountain
shores
behind
them
shrank
down
upon
the
gray
horizon
it
seemed
that
for
once
the
weather
was
going
to
be
kind
to
them
and
their
spirits
rose
in
consequence
they
ate
frequently
food
being
the
great
fuel
of
the
north
and
midday
found
them
well
out
upon
the
heaving
bosom
of
the
straits
with
the
kodiak
shores
plainly
visible
then
as
if
tired
of
toying
with
them
the
wind
rose
it
did
not
blow
up
a
gale
merely
a
frigid
breath
that
cut
them
like
steel
and
halted
their
progress
had
it
sprung
from
the
north
it
would
have
wafted
them
on
their
way
but
it
drew
in
from
the
pacific
straight
into
their
teeth
forcing
them
to
redouble
their
exertions
it
was
not
of
sufficient
violence
to
overcome
their
efforts
but
it
held
them
back
and
stirred
up
a
nasty
cross
sea
into
which
the
canoe
plunged
and
wallowed
in
the
hope
that
it
would
die
down
with
the
darkness
the
boatmen
held
on
their
course
and
night
closed
over
them
still
paddling
silently
it
was
nearly
noon
on
the
following
day
when
the
watchman
at
the
uyak
cannery
beheld
a
native
canoe
creeping
slowly
up
the
bay
and
was
astonished
to
find
it
manned
by
three
white
men
in
the
last
stages
of
exhaustion
so
stiff
and
cramped
and
numb
that
he
was
forced
to
help
them
from
their
places
when
at
last
they
effected
a
landing
one
of
them
in
fact
was
unconscious
and
had
to
be
carried
to
the
house
which
did
not
surprise
the
watchman
when
he
learned
whence
they
had
come
he
did
marvel
however
that
another
of
the
travellers
should
begin
to
cry
weakly
when
told
that
the
mail
boat
had
sailed
for
kodiak
the
previous
evening
he
gave
them
stimulants
then
prepared
hot
food
for
them
for
both
balt
and
emerson
were
like
and
fraser
when
he
was
restored
to
consciousness
was
too
weak
to
stand
too
bad
you
did
get
in
last
night
said
the
sympathetically
she
wo
be
back
now
for
a
month
or
more
how
long
will
she
lie
in
kodiak
big
george
asked
the
captain
told
me
he
was
going
to
spend
christmas
there
lefs
see
is
the
she
pull
out
for
juneau
on
the
morning
of
the
that
three
days
we
must
catch
her
cried
emerson
quickly
if
you
land
us
in
kodiak
on
time
i
pay
you
anything
you
ask
i
like
to
but
i
ca
the
man
replied
you
see
i
here
all
alone
except
for
johnson
he
the
watchman
for
the
other
plant
then
for
god
sake

some
natives
i
do
care
what
it
costs
there
ai
any
natives
here
this
ai
no
village
there
nothing
here
but
these
two
plants
and
johnson
or
me
dassent
leave
emerson
turned
his
eyes
upon
the
haggard
man
who
sprawled
weakly
in
a
chair
and
fraser
noting
the
appeal
answered
gamely
with
a
forced
smile
on
his
lips
though
they
were
drawn
and
bloodless
sure
i
be
ready
to
leave
in
the
morning
pal
the
old
russian
village
of
kodiak
lies
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
island
from
the
canneries
a
bleak
relic
of
the
first
occupation
and
although
peopled
largely
by
natives
and
breeds
there
is
also
a
considerable
white
population
to
whom
christmas
is
a
season
of
thanksgiving
and
celebration
hence
it
was
that
the
crew
of
the
dora
were
well
content
to
pass
the
yuletide
there
where
the
girls
are
pretty
and
a
hearty
welcome
is
accorded
to
every
one
there
were
drinking
and
dancing
and
music
behind
the
log
walls
and
the
big
red
stoves
made
havoc
with
the
salt
wind
the
town
was
well
filled
and
the
merrymaking
vigorous
and
inasmuch
as
winter
is
a
time
of
rest
during
which
none
but
the
most
foolhardy
trust
themselves
to
the
perils
of
the
sea
it
caused
much
comment
when
late
on
christmas
afternoon
an
canoe
bearing
three
strange
white
men
landed
on
the
beach
beside
the
dock
or
were
they
white
men
after
all
their
faces
were
so
blackened
and
split
from
the
frost
they
seemed
to
be
raw
bleeding
masks
their
hands
were
cracked
and
stiff
beneath
their
mittens
they
were
and
gaunt
their
cheeks
sunken
away
as
if
from
a
wasting
illness
and
they
could
not
walk
but
crept
across
the
shingle
on
hands
and
knees
then
reaching
the
street
hobbled
painfully
while
their
limbs
gave
way
as
if
paralyzed
one
of
them
lacked
strength
even
to
leave
the
canoe
and
when
two
sailors
ran
down
and
lifted
him
out
he
gabbled
strangely
in
the
jargon
of
the
mining
camp
and
the
gambling
table
of
the
other
two
one
a
great
awkward
shambling
giant
of
a
creature
stumbled
out
along
the
dock
toward
the
ship
his
head
hung
low
and
swinging
from
side
to
side
his
shoulders
drooping
his
arms
his
knees
bending
illustration
out
across
the
lonesome
waste
they
journeyed
but
the
third
voyager
who
had
with
difficulty
won
his
way
up
to
the
level
of
the
street
presented
the
strangest
appearance
there
was
something
uncanny
about
him
as
he
gained
the
street
he
waved
back
all
proffered
assistance
then
paused
with
his
swaying
body
propped
upon
widespread
legs
staring
malignantly
into
the
north
from
their
deep
sockets
his
eyes
glittered
like
live
coals
while
his
blackened
swollen
lips
split
in
a
grimace
that
bared
his
teeth
he
raised
his
arms
slowly
and
shook
his
clenched
fists
defiantly
at
the
polar
skies
muttering
unintelligible
things
then
staggered
after
his
companions
chapter
viii
wherein
boyd
admits
his
failure
a
week
later
boyd
and
george
were
watching
the
lights
of
port
townsend
blink
out
in
the
gloom
astern
a
quick
change
of
boats
at
juneau
had
raised
their
spirits
enabling
them
to
complete
the
second
stage
of
their
journey
in
less
than
the
expected
time
and
the
southward
run
out
from
the
breath
of
the
arctics
into
a
balmier
climate
had
removed
nearly
the
last
trace
of
their
suffering
from
the
frost
a
sort
of
meditative
silence
which
had
fallen
upon
the
two
men
was
broken
at
last
by
george
who
for
some
time
had
been
showing
signs
of
uneasiness
how
long
are
we
going
to
stay
in
seattle
he
inquired
only
long
enough
boyd
replied
for
me
to
arrange
a
connection
with
some
bank
that
will
require
a
day
perhaps
i
suppose
a
feller
has
got
to
dress
pretty
swell
back
there
in
chicago
george
ventured
some
people
do
suits
of
clothes
eh
yes
did
you
ever
wear
one
certainly
well
i
be
the
fisherman
checked
himself
and
gazed
at
his
companion
as
if
he
saw
him
suddenly
in
a
new
light
in
fact
he
had
discovered
many
strange
phases
of
this
young
man
character
during
the
past
fortnight
right
along
he
questioned
incredulously
why
yes
pretty
steadily
all
day
at
a
time
boyd
laughed
i
have
worn
one
in
the
daytime
since
i
left
college
they
are
used
only
at
night
george
pondered
this
for
some
time
while
emerson
stared
out
into
the
velvet
darkness
to
be
roused
again
a
moment
later
a
feller
told
me
a
funny
thing
once
he
said
them
rich
men
back
east
had
women
come
around
and
clean
their
and
shine
up
is
that
right
quite
right
another
pause
then
balt
cleared
his
throat
and
said
with
an
assumption
of
carelessness
well
i
do
suppose
you
ever
had
shine
your
did
you
yes
the
big
man
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
then
evidently
changing
his
mind
observed
seems
to
me
i
better
stay
here
on
the
coast
and
wait
for
you
no
indeed
the
other
answered
quickly
i
will
need
you
in
raising
that
money
you
know
the
practical
side
of
the
fishing
business
and
i
do
all
right
i
go
if
you
can
stand
for
me
i
stand
for
the
suits
of
clothes
and
the
women
anyhow
it
last
long
when
were
you
outside
last
four
years
ago
ever
been
east
sure
i
got
a
sister
in
spokane
falls
but
i
do
like
it
back
there
you
will
have
a
good
time
in
chicago
boyd
smiled
fingerless
fraser
came
to
them
from
the
lighted
regions
amidship
greeting
them
cheerfully
well
we
pretty
near
there
ai
we
i
glad
of
it
i
about
cleaned
up
this
ship
the
adventurer
had
left
his
companions
alone
much
of
the
time
during
the
trip
greatly
to
boyd
relief
for
the
fellow
was
an
unconscionable
bore
and
had
thus
allowed
them
time
to
perfect
their
plans
and
thresh
out
numberless
details
i
grabbed
another
farmer
son
at
supper
just
got
through
with
him
he
was
good
for
three
hundred
and
fifty
questioned
balt
yep
i
opened
a
little
stud
game
for
him
beats
all
how
these
suckers
fall
for
the
old
stuff
where
did
you
get
money
to
gamble
with
inquired
boyd
oh
i
won
a
pinch
of
change
last
night
in
a
bridge
game
with
that
dawson
bunch
but
it
must
have
required
a
to
sit
in
a
game
with
them
they
seem
to
be
heavy
spenders
how
did
you
manage
that
i
sold
some
mining
property
the
day
before
i
got
the
captain
of
the
ship
fraser
chuckled
did
you
swindle
that
old
fellow
emerson
cried
angrily
see
here
i
wo
allow
swindle
who
said
i
anybody
i
would
trim
my
worst
enemy
you
have
no
mining
claims
what
makes
you
think
i
have
alaska
is
a
big
country
you
told
me
so
well
i
did
have
any
claims
at
that
time
but
since
we
came
aboard
of
this
wagon
at
juneau
i
have
improved
each
shining
hour
while
you
and
george
was
building
canneries
i
was
rustling
and
i
did
pretty
well
if
i
do
say
it
as
should
emerson
shrugged
his
broad
shoulders
you
will
get
into
trouble
if
you
do
i
wo
come
to
your
rescue
i
have
helped
you
all
i
can
not
me
denied
the
fraser
there
ai
a
chance
why
because
i
on
the
level
i
am
that
why
but
say
getting
money
from
these
reubs
is
a
joke
it
like
kicking
a
lamb
in
the
face
he
clinked
some
gold
coins
in
his
pocket
and
began
to
whistle
noiselessly
when
do
we
pull
out
for
chi
he
next
inquired
we
said
emerson
i
told
you
i
would
take
you
as
far
as
seattle
i
ca
stand
for
your
i
think
you
had
better
stop
here
you
perhaps
it
for
the
best
fraser
observed
carelessly
time
alone
can
tell
he
bade
them
and
disappeared
to
snatch
a
few
hours
sleep
but
upon
their
arrival
at
the
dock
on
the
following
morning
without
waiting
for
an
invitation
he
bundled
himself
into
their
carriage
and
rode
to
the
hotel
registering
immediately
beneath
them
they
soon
lost
sight
of
him
however
for
their
next
move
was
in
the
direction
of
a
clothier
where
they
were
outfitted
from
sole
to
crown
the
garments
they
stood
up
in
showed
whence
they
had
come
yet
the
strangeness
of
their
apparel
excited
little
comment
for
seattle
is
the
gateway
to
the
great
north
country
and
hither
the
northmen
foregather
going
and
coming
but
to
them
the
city
was
very
strange
and
exciting
the
noises
deafened
them
the
odors
of
civilization
now
tantalized
now
offended
their
nostrils
the
crowding
streams
of
humanity
confused
them
fresh
from
their
long
sojourn
in
the
silences
and
solitudes
every
clatter
and
crash
every
brazen
clang
of
gong
caused
george
to
start
he
watched
his
chance
and
took
as
if
pursued
if
one
of
them
bells
rings
behind
me
he
declared
i
jump
through
a
window
when
his
roving
eyes
first
lighted
upon
a
fruit
stand
he
bolted
for
it
and
filled
his
pockets
with
tomatoes
i
dreamed
about
these
things
for
four
years
he
declared
and
i
ca
stand
it
any
longer
he
bit
into
one
voraciously
and
thereafter
followed
his
companion
about
munching
tomatoes
at
every
step
refilling
his
pockets
as
his
supply
diminished
to
show
his
willingness
for
any
sacrifice
he
volunteered
to
wear
a
dress
suit
if
emerson
would
buy
it
for
him
and
it
required
considerable
argument
to
convince
him
that
the
garb
was
unnecessary
you
better
train
me
up
before
we
get
east
he
warned
or
i
make
your
swell
friends
sore
and
spoil
the
deal
i
could
wear
it
on
the
cars
and
get
easy
in
it
my
dear
fellow
it
takes
more
than
a
week
to
easy
in
a
dress
suit
boyd
smiled
amused
at
his
earnestness
for
the
big
fellow
was
merely
a
boy
out
on
a
wonderful
vacation
well
if
there
is
a
manicure
woman
in
seattle
show
her
to
me
and
i
practice
on
her
he
insisted
she
can
me
at
least
yes
it
might
not
hurt
to
get
that
off
your
hands
emerson
acknowledged
at
which
the
clothier
clerk
who
had
noted
the
condition
of
the
fisherman
huge
paws
snickered
audibly
it
was
a
labor
of
several
hours
to
fit
big
george
bulky
frame
and
when
the
two
returned
to
the
hotel
emerson
found
the
representative
of
an
afternoon
newspaper
anxiously
awaiting
him
at
the
desk
we
noticed
your
arrival
from
the
north
began
the
reporter
and
athens
sent
me
down
to
get
a
story
athens
billy
athens
yes
he
is
the
editor
i
believe
you
two
were
college
mates
he
wanted
to
know
if
you
are
the
boyd
emerson
of
the
michigan
football
team
well
well
boyd
mused
billy
athens
was
a
good
tackle
he
thought
you
might
have
something
interesting
to
tell
about
alaska
the
newspaper
man
went
on
however
i
wo
need
to
take
much
of
your
time
for
your
partner
has
been
telling
me
all
about
you
and
your
trip
and
your
great
success
my
partner
yes
frobisher
he
heard
me
inquire
about
you
and
volunteered
to
give
me
an
interview
in
your
name
frobisher
said
emerson
now
thoroughly
mystified
sure
that
him
over
yonder
the
reporter
indicated
fingerless
fraser
who
having
watched
the
interview
from
a
distance
now
solemnly
closed
one
eye
and
stuck
his
tongue
into
his
cheek
oh
yes
yes
boyd
stammered
certainly
he
is
a
character
is
he
he
told
me
how
you
rescued
that
girl
when
she
broke
through
the
ice
at
kalvik
he
did
quite
a
romance
was
it
it
is
a
good
newspaper
story
and
i
play
it
up
he
is
going
to
let
me
in
on
that
hydraulic
proposition
of
yours
too
of
course
i
have
much
money
but
it
sounds
great
and
how
far
along
did
you
get
with
your
negotiations
about
this
hydraulic
proposition
boyd
asked
curiously
just
far
enough
so
i
all
on
edge
for
it
i
make
up
a
little
pool
among
the
boys
at
the
office
and
have
the
money
down
here
before
you
leave
i
am
sorry
but
frobisher
and
i
will
have
to
talk
it
over
first
said
emerson
grimly
i
think
we
will
keep
that
proposition
in
the
family
so
to
speak
then
you
wo
let
me
in
not
just
at
present
i
sorry
i
should
like
to
take
a
chance
with
somebody
who
is
really
successful
at
mining
when
a
fellow
drones
along
on
a
salary
month
after
month
it
makes
him
envious
to
see
you
klondikers
hit
town
with
satchels
full
of
coin
perhaps
you
will
give
me
a
chance
later
on
perhaps
acceded
boyd
but
when
the
young
man
had
gone
he
strode
quickly
over
to
fraser
who
was
lolling
back
comfortably
smoking
a
ridiculously
long
cigar
with
an
elaborate
gold
band
look
here
he
said
in
a
low
tone
what
do
you
mean
by
mixing
me
up
in
your
frauds
fraser
grinned
is
hot
monaker
ai
it
it
sounds
like
the
money
i
believe
i
stick
to
i
spiked
your
miserable
little
scheme
and
if
you
try
anything
more
like
that
i
have
to
cut
you
out
altogether
pshaw
said
the
adventurer
mildly
did
you
say
that
hydraulic
mine
was
no
good
too
bad
that
reporter
agreed
to
take
some
stock
right
away
and
promised
to
get
his
editor
in
on
it
too
his
editor
emerson
cried
aghast
why
his
editor
happens
to
be
a
friend
of
mine
whose
assistance
i
may
need
very
badly
when
i
get
back
from
chicago
oh
well
that
different
of
course
now
see
here
fraser
i
want
you
to
leave
me
out
of
your
machinations
absolutely
you
been
very
decent
to
me
in
many
ways
but
if
i
hear
of
anything
more
like
this
i
shall
hand
you
over
to
the
police
do
be
a
sucker
all
your
life
admonished
the
rogue
you
stick
to
me
and
i
make
you
a
lot
of
money
i
like
you
emerson
now
seriously
angry
wheeled
and
left
him
realizing
that
the
fellow
was
morally
atrophied
he
could
not
forget
however
that
except
for
this
impossible
creature
he
himself
would
be
lying
at
store
at
katmai
with
no
faintest
hope
of
completing
his
mission
wherefore
he
did
his
best
to
swallow
his
indignation
hey
what
time
do
we
leave
fraser
called
after
him
but
the
young
man
would
not
answer
proceeding
instead
to
his
room
there
to
renew
his
touch
with
the
world
through
strange
clean
garments
the
feel
of
which
awakened
memories
and
spurred
him
on
to
feverish
haste
when
he
had
dressed
he
hurried
to
a
telegraph
office
and
dispatched
two
messages
to
chicago
one
addressed
to
his
own
tailor
the
other
to
a
number
on
lake
shore
drive
over
the
latter
he
pondered
long
tearing
up
several
drafts
which
did
not
suit
him
finally
giving
one
to
the
operator
with
an
odd
mingling
of
timidity
and
defiance
this
done
he
hastened
to
one
of
the
leading
banks
and
two
hours
later
returned
to
the
hotel
jubilant
he
found
big
george
in
the
lobby
staring
with
fascinated
eyes
at
his
which
were
strangely
purified
and
glossy
look
at
the
fisherman
broke
out
admiringly
they
as
clean
as
a
hound
tooth
they
shine
so
i
dassent
take
hold
of
anything
i
have
made
my
deal
with
the
bank
boyd
exulted
all
i
need
to
raise
now
is
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
the
bank
will
advance
the
rest
that
great
said
balt
without
interrupting
the
contemplation
of
his
digits
that
certainly
immense
say
do
they
glisten
they
look
very
nice
stylish
i
think
that
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
the
task
is
easy
now
we
will
make
it
go
sure
these
bankers
know
what
that
salmon
business
is
why
i
had
no
trouble
at
all
they
say
we
ca
lose
if
we
have
a
good
site
on
the
kalvik
river
they
wise
all
right
i
guess
that
girl
took
me
for
a
klondiker
george
observed
she
charged
me
double
but
she
was
a
nice
girl
though
i
was
kind
of
rattled
when
i
walked
in
and
sat
down
and
i
could
think
of
nothing
to
talk
about
i
never
opened
my
head
all
the
time
but
she
did
notice
it
when
i
left
she
asked
me
to
come
back
again
and
have
another
nice
long
visit
she
an
fine
girl
look
out
laughed
his
companion
every
alaskan
falls
in
love
with
a
manicurist
at
some
time
or
other
it
seems
to
be
in
the
blood
we
are
going
to
have
no
matrimony
mind
you
lord
she
would
look
at
me
said
the
fisherman
suddenly
assuming
a
lobster
pink
that
evening
they
dined
as
befits
men
just
out
from
a
long
incarceration
in
the
north
first
having
tried
unsuccessfully
to
locate
fraser
for
the
rogue
was
bound
to
them
by
the
intangible
ties
of
hardship
and
trail
life
and
they
could
not
bear
to
part
from
him
without
some
expression
of
gratitude
for
the
sacrifices
he
had
made
but
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
not
even
at
train
time
that
seems
hardly
decent
boyd
remarked
he
might
at
least
have
said
and
wished
us
well
when
he
around
he
makes
me
sore
and
when
he
away
i
miss
him
said
george
he
probably
out
organizing
something
or
somebody
at
the
station
they
waited
until
the
last
warning
had
sounded
vainly
hoping
that
fraser
would
put
in
an
appearance
then
sought
their
pullman
more
piqued
than
they
cared
to
admit
when
the
train
pulled
out
they
went
forward
to
the
smoking
compartment
still
meditating
upon
this
unexpected
defection
but
as
they
lighted
their
cigars
a
familiar
voice
greeted
them
hello
you
and
there
was
fraser
grinning
at
their
astonishment
what
are
you
doing
here
they
cried
together
me
oh
i
on
my
way
east
whereabouts
east
chicago
ai
it
i
thought
that
was
what
you
said
he
seated
himself
and
lighted
another
long
cigar
are
you
going
to
chicago
george
asked
sure
we
got
to
put
this
cannery
deal
over
the
crook
sighed
luxuriously
and
began
to
blow
smoke
rings
pretty
nice
train
it
yes
ejaculated
emerson
undecided
whether
to
be
pleased
or
angered
at
the
fellow
presence
which
is
your
car
this
one
same
as
yours
i
got
the
what
are
you
going
to
do
in
chicago
oh
i
ai
fully
decided
yet
but
i
might
do
a
little
promoting
seattle
is
too
full
of
alaskan
snares
emerson
reflected
for
a
moment
before
remarking
i
dare
say
you
will
tangle
me
up
in
some
new
enterprise
that
will
land
us
both
in
jail
so
for
my
own
protection
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
have
noticed
that
you
are
a
good
salesman
and
if
you
will
take
up
something
legitimate
legitimate
fraser
interrupted
with
indignation
why
all
my
schemes
are
legitimate
anybody
can
examine
them
if
he
do
like
them
he
need
go
in
if
he
weakens
on
one
proposition
i
get
something
that
suits
him
better
you
got
me
wrong
if
you
want
to
handle
something
honest
i
let
you
place
some
of
this
cannery
stock
on
a
commission
i
do
see
nothing
attractive
in
that
when
i
can
sell
stock
of
my
own
and
keep
the
money
maybe
i
organize
a
cannery
company
of
my
own
in
chicago
if
you
do
boyd
exploded
very
well
do
get
sore
i
only
just
suggested
the
possibility
if
that
is
your
graft
i
think
up
something
better
the
younger
man
shook
his
head
you
are
impossible
said
he
and
yet
i
ca
help
liking
you
late
into
the
night
they
talked
emerson
oscillating
between
extreme
volubility
and
deep
abstraction
at
one
moment
he
was
as
gay
as
a
prospective
bridegroom
at
the
next
he
was
more
dejected
than
a
man
under
sentence
and
instead
of
growing
calmer
his
spirits
became
more
and
more
variable
with
the
near
approach
of
the
journey
end
in
chicago
as
in
seattle
fraser
accompanied
his
to
their
hotel
and
would
have
registered
himself
under
some
alias
except
for
a
whispered
threat
from
boyd
that
young
gentleman
after
seeing
his
companions
comfortably
ensconced
left
them
to
their
own
devices
while
he
drove
to
the
tailor
to
whom
he
had
telegraphed
returning
in
a
short
time
garbed
in
new
clothes
he
found
fraser
sipping
a
solitary
cocktail
and
visiting
with
the
bartender
on
the
closest
terms
of
intimacy
george
said
that
one
in
answer
to
his
inquiry
oh
george
has
gone
on
a
for
a
manicure
parlor
ai
that
a
rave
he
gone
he
ought
to
have
them
front
feet
shod
he
do
need
a
manicurist
what
he
wants
is
a
blacksmith
he
is
rather
out
of
his
latitude
so
i
wish
you
would
keep
an
eye
on
him
boyd
said
all
right
i
take
him
out
in
the
park
on
a
leash
but
if
he
tries
to
bite
anybody
i
have
to
muzzle
him
he
ai
safe
in
the
heart
of
a
great
city
he
a
menace
to
the
life
and
limb
of
every
manicure
woman
who
crosses
his
path
you
gave
him
an
awful
push
on
the
downward
path
when
you
laid
him
against
this
finger
stuff
promptly
at
four
emerson
called
a
cab
and
was
driven
toward
the
north
side
as
the
vehicle
rolled
up
lake
shore
drive
the
excitement
under
which
he
had
been
laboring
for
days
increased
until
he
tapped
his
feet
nervously
clenched
his
gloved
fingers
and
patted
the
cushions
as
if
to
accelerate
the
horse
footfalls
would
he
never
arrive
the
animal
appeared
to
crawl
more
slowly
every
moment
the
wheels
to
turn
more
sluggishly
with
each
revolution
he
called
to
the
driver
to
hurry
then
found
himself
of
a
sudden
gripped
by
an
overpowering
hesitation
and
grew
frightened
at
his
own
haste
the
close
atmosphere
of
the
cab
seemed
to
stifle
him
he
jerked
the
window
open
flung
back
the
lapels
of
his
great
coat
and
inhaled
the
sharp
lake
air
in
deep
breaths
why
did
that
driver
lash
a
willing
steed
they
were
nearly
there
and
he
was
not
ready
yet
he
leaned
out
to
check
their
speed
then
closed
his
lips
and
settled
back
in
his
seat
staring
at
the
houses
slipping
past
how
well
he
remembered
every
one
of
them
the
dark
stone
frowned
at
him
the
leaded
windows
stared
at
him
through
a
blind
film
of
unrecognition
the
carven
gargoyles
grinned
mockingly
at
him
it
all
oppressed
him
heavily
and
crushed
whatever
hope
had
lain
at
his
heart
when
he
left
the
hotel
never
before
had
his
goal
seemed
so
unattainable
never
before
had
he
felt
so
bitterly
the
cruelty
of
riches
the
hopelessness
of
poverty
the
vehicle
drew
up
at
last
before
one
of
the
most
pretentious
residences
a
massive
pile
of
stone
and
brick
fronting
the
lake
with
what
seemed
to
him
a
singularly
proud
and
chilling
aspect
his
hand
shook
as
he
paid
the
driver
and
it
was
a
very
pale
though
very
erect
young
man
who
mounted
the
stone
steps
to
the
bell
despite
the
stiffness
with
which
he
held
himself
he
felt
the
muscles
at
his
knees
trembling
weakly
while
his
lungs
did
not
seem
to
fill
even
when
he
inhaled
deeply
during
the
moments
that
he
waited
he
found
his
body
pulsating
to
the
slow
heavy
thumping
of
his
heart
then
a
familiar
face
greeted
him
how
do
you
do
hawkins
he
heard
himself
saying
as
a
liveried
old
man
ushered
him
in
and
took
his
coat
do
you
remember
me
yes
sir
emerson
you
have
been
away
for
a
long
time
sir
is
miss
wayland
in
yes
sir
she
is
expecting
you
this
way
please
boyd
followed
thankful
for
the
subdued
light
which
might
conceal
his
agitation
he
knew
where
they
were
going
she
had
always
awaited
him
in
the
library
so
it
seemed
and
how
well
he
remembered
that
wonderful
book
walled
room
it
was
like
her
to
welcome
him
on
the
spot
where
she
had
bade
him
three
years
ago
hawkins
held
the
portieres
aside
and
boyd
heard
their
velvet
swish
at
his
back
yet
for
the
briefest
instant
he
did
not
see
her
so
motionless
did
she
stand
then
he
cried
softly
my
lady
and
strode
forward
boyd
boyd
she
answered
and
came
to
meet
him
yielding
herself
to
his
arms
she
felt
his
heart
pounding
against
hers
like
the
heart
of
a
runner
who
has
spent
himself
at
the
tape
felt
his
arms
quivering
as
if
from
great
fatigue
for
a
long
time
neither
spoke
chapter
ix
and
is
granted
a
year
of
grace
and
so
all
your
privations
and
hardships
went
for
nothing
said
mildred
wayland
when
boyd
had
recounted
the
history
of
his
pilgrimage
into
the
north
yes
he
replied
as
a
miner
i
am
a
very
wretched
failure
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
in
disapproval
do
use
that
term
she
cried
there
is
no
word
so
hateful
to
me
as
i
suppose
because
father
has
never
failed
in
anything
let
us
say
that
your
success
has
been
delayed
very
well
that
suits
me
better
also
but
you
see
i
forgotten
how
to
choose
nice
words
they
were
seated
in
the
library
where
for
two
hours
they
had
remained
undisturbed
emerson
talking
rapidly
almost
incoherently
as
if
this
were
a
sort
of
confessional
the
girl
hanging
eagerly
upon
his
every
word
following
his
narrative
with
breathless
interest
the
story
had
been
substantially
the
same
as
that
which
once
before
he
had
related
to
cherry
malotte
but
now
the
facts
were
deeply
intimately
colored
with
all
the
young
man
natural
enthusiasm
and
inmost
personal
feeling
to
his
listener
it
was
like
some
wonderful
romance
having
to
do
with
strange
people
whose
motives
she
could
scarcely
grasp
and
pitched
amid
wild
scenes
that
she
could
not
fully
picture
and
you
did
all
that
for
me
she
mused
after
a
time
it
was
the
only
way
i
wonder
if
any
other
man
i
know
would
take
those
risks
just
for
me
of
course
why
the
risk
i
mean
the
physical
peril
and
hardship
and
discomfort
do
amount
to
that
he
snapped
his
fingers
it
was
only
the
unending
desolation
that
hurt
it
was
the
separation
from
you
that
punished
me
the
thought
that
some
luckier
fellow
might
nonsense
mildred
was
really
indignant
i
told
you
to
fix
your
own
time
and
i
promised
to
wait
even
if
i
had
not
cared
for
you
i
would
have
kept
my
word
that
is
a
wayland
principle
as
it
is
it
was
comparatively
easy
then
you
do
love
me
my
lady
he
leaned
eagerly
toward
her
do
you
need
to
ask
she
whispered
from
the
shelter
of
his
arms
it
is
the
same
old
fascination
of
our
girl
and
boy
days
do
you
remember
how
completely
i
lost
my
head
about
you
she
laughed
softly
i
used
to
think
you
wore
a
football
suit
better
than
anybody
in
the
world
sometimes
i
suspect
that
it
is
merely
that
same
girlish
and
ca
last
but
it
lasted
so
far
three
years
is
a
long
time
for
a
girl
like
me
to
wait
is
it
i
know
i
know
he
returned
jealously
but
i
have
lived
that
time
with
nothing
but
a
memory
while
you
have
had
other
things
to
occupy
you
you
are
flattered
and
courted
by
men
scores
of
men
oh
legions
of
men
oh
i
know
have
i
devoured
society
columns
by
the
yard
the
papers
were
six
months
old
to
be
sure
when
i
got
them
but
every
mention
of
you
was
like
a
knife
stab
to
me
jealousy
drove
me
to
memorize
the
name
of
every
man
with
whom
you
were
seen
in
public
and
i
called
down
all
sorts
of
curses
upon
their
heads
i
used
to
torture
my
lonely
soul
with
hideous
pictures
of
you
hideous
pictures
of
me
the
girl
perked
her
head
to
one
side
and
glanced
at
him
bewitchingly
you
very
flattering
yes
pictures
of
you
with
a
caravan
of
suitors
at
your
heels
you
foolish
boy
suitors
do
come
in
caravans
they
come
in
cabs
well
my
simile
is
far
wrong
in
other
respects
he
replied
with
a
flash
of
her
spirit
but
anyhow
i
pictured
you
surrounded
by
all
the
beautiful
things
of
your
life
here
forever
in
the
scent
of
flowers
in
the
lights
of
in
the
soft
music
of
hidden
instruments
god
how
i
tortured
myself
you
were
never
out
of
mind
for
an
hour
my
days
were
given
to
you
and
i
used
to
pray
that
my
dreams
might
hold
nothing
but
you
you
have
been
my
fetish
from
the
first
day
i
met
you
and
my
worship
has
grown
blinder
every
hour
mildred
you
were
always
out
of
my
reach
but
i
have
kept
my
eyes
raised
toward
you
just
the
same
and
i
have
never
looked
aside
never
faltered
he
paused
to
feast
his
eyes
upon
her
and
then
in
a
finished
oh
my
lady
how
beautiful
you
are
and
indeed
she
was
for
her
face
ordinarily
so
imperious
was
now
softly
alight
her
eyes
which
other
men
found
cold
were
kindled
with
a
rare
warmth
of
understanding
her
smile
was
almost
wistfully
sweet
to
her
lover
she
seemed
to
bend
beneath
the
burden
of
her
brown
hair
yet
her
slim
figure
had
the
strength
and
poise
which
come
of
fine
physical
inheritance
and
high
spirit
every
gesture
every
unstudied
attitude
revealed
the
grace
of
the
well
born
woman
it
was
this
air
of
hers
in
fact
which
had
originally
attracted
him
he
recalled
how
excited
he
had
been
in
that
time
when
he
had
first
learned
her
identity
for
the
name
of
wayland
was
spoken
soundingly
in
the
middle
west
in
the
early
stages
of
their
acquaintance
he
had
looked
upon
her
aloofness
as
an
affectation
but
a
close
intimacy
had
compelled
a
recognition
of
it
as
something
wholly
natural
he
found
her
as
truly
a
patrician
as
wayne
wayland
her
father
could
wish
the
old
man
domain
was
greater
than
that
of
many
princes
and
his
power
more
absolute
his
only
daughter
he
spoiled
as
thoroughly
as
he
ruled
his
part
of
the
financial
world
and
wilful
mildred
once
she
had
taken
an
interest
in
the
young
college
man
so
evidently
ready
to
be
numbered
among
her
lovers
did
not
pause
half
way
but
made
her
preference
patent
to
all
and
opened
to
him
a
realm
of
dazzling
possibilities
he
well
remembered
the
perplexities
of
those
first
delirious
days
when
her
regard
was
beginning
to
make
itself
apparent
she
was
so
different
so
wonderfully
far
removed
from
all
he
knew
that
he
doubted
his
own
senses
his
friends
indeed
lost
no
opportunity
of
informing
him
that
he
was
a
tremendously
favored
young
man
but
this
phase
of
the
affair
had
caused
him
little
thought
simply
because
the
girl
herself
had
come
so
swiftly
to
overshadow
in
his
regard
every
other
consideration
even
her
own
wealth
and
position
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
but
be
aware
that
his
standing
in
his
little
world
was
subtly
altered
as
soon
as
he
became
known
as
the
favored
suitor
of
wayne
wayland
daughter
he
began
to
receive
favors
from
comparative
strangers
unexpected
social
privileges
were
granted
him
his
way
was
made
easier
in
a
hundred
particulars
from
every
quarter
delicately
gratifying
distinctions
came
to
him
without
his
volition
he
found
that
he
had
risen
to
an
entirely
different
position
from
that
which
he
had
formerly
occupied
the
mere
coupling
of
his
name
with
mildred
wayland
had
lifted
him
into
a
calcium
glare
it
affected
him
not
at
all
he
only
knew
that
he
was
truly
enslaved
to
the
girl
that
he
idolized
her
that
he
regarded
her
as
something
priceless
sacred
she
in
turn
frankly
capitulated
to
him
in
proud
disregard
of
what
her
world
might
say
as
complete
in
her
surrender
to
this
new
lover
as
she
had
been
inaccessible
in
her
reserve
toward
all
the
rest
and
when
he
had
graduated
how
proud
of
her
he
had
been
how
little
he
had
realized
the
gulf
that
separated
them
and
how
quick
had
been
his
awakening
it
was
wayne
wayland
who
had
shown
him
his
folly
he
had
talked
to
the
young
engineer
kindly
if
firmly
being
too
shrewd
an
old
diplomat
to
fan
the
flame
of
a
headstrong
love
with
vigorous
opposition
mildred
is
a
rich
girl
the
old
financier
had
told
boyd
a
very
rich
girl
one
of
the
richest
girls
in
this
part
of
the
world
while
you
my
boy
what
have
you
to
offer
nothing
but
you
were
not
always
what
you
are
now
emerson
had
replied
every
man
has
to
make
a
start
when
you
married
you
were
as
poor
as
i
am
granted
but
i
married
a
poor
girl
from
my
own
station
in
life
fortunately
she
had
the
latent
power
to
develop
with
me
as
i
grew
so
that
we
kept
even
and
i
never
outdistanced
her
but
mildred
is
spoiled
to
begin
with
i
spoiled
her
purposely
to
prevent
just
this
sort
of
thing
she
is
bred
to
luxury
her
friends
are
rich
and
she
know
any
other
kind
of
life
her
tastes
and
habits
and
inclinations
are
extravagant
to
put
it
plainly
yes
worse
than
extravagant
they
are
positively
scandalous
she
is
about
the
richest
girl
in
the
country
and
by
virtue
of
wealth
as
well
as
breeding
she
is
one
of
the
american
aristocracy
oh
people
may
say
what
they
please
but
we
have
an
aristocracy
all
the
same
which
is
just
as
well
marked
and
just
as
exclusive
as
if
it
rested
upon
birth
instead
of
bank
accounts
you
would
object
to
our
marriage
if
i
were
rich
and
mildred
were
poor
emerson
had
said
rather
cynically
perhaps
not
a
poor
girl
can
marry
a
rich
man
and
get
along
all
right
if
she
has
brains
but
a
very
rich
girl
ca
marry
a
very
poor
man
and
be
happy
unless
she
is
peculiarly
constituted
i
happen
to
know
that
my
girl
is
so
constituted
she
is
utterly
impossible
as
a
poor
wife
she
ca
anything
she
ca
economize
she
ca
amuse
herself
she
ca
be
happy
without
the
things
she
is
accustomed
to
it
is
in
her
blood
and
training
and
disposition
she
would
try
bless
you
she
would
try
all
right
for
a
while
but
i
know
her
better
than
she
knows
herself
you
see
i
have
the
advantage
of
knowing
myself
and
of
having
known
her
mother
before
her
she
is
a
hothouse
flower
and
adversity
would
wither
her
mind
you
i
do
say
that
her
husband
must
be
a
millionaire
but
he
will
need
a
running
start
on
the
road
to
make
her
happy
and
well
the
fellow
who
gets
my
girl
will
make
her
happy
or
i
make
him
damned
miserable
the
old
fellow
had
squared
his
jaws
belligerently
at
this
statement
you
have
nothing
against
me
personally
i
mean
nothing
she
loves
me
she
seems
to
but
both
of
you
are
young
and
may
get
over
it
before
you
reach
the
last
hurdle
then
you
forbid
it
boyd
had
queried
his
own
glance
challenging
that
of
her
father
by
no
means
i
neither
forbid
nor
consent
i
merely
ask
you
to
stand
still
and
use
your
eyes
for
a
little
while
you
have
intelligence
do
be
hasty
i
am
going
to
tell
her
just
what
i
have
told
you
and
i
think
she
is
sensible
enough
to
realize
the
truth
of
my
remarks
no
instead
of
forbidding
you
mildred
society
i
am
going
to
give
you
all
you
want
of
it
i
am
going
to
make
you
free
at
our
house
i
am
going
to
see
that
you
meet
her
friends
and
go
where
she
goes
i
want
you
to
do
the
things
that
she
does
and
see
how
she
lives
the
more
you
see
of
us
the
better
it
will
suit
me
i
have
been
studying
you
for
some
time
emerson
and
i
think
i
have
read
you
correctly
after
you
have
spent
a
few
months
with
us
come
to
me
again
and
we
will
talk
it
over
i
may
say
yes
by
that
time
or
you
may
not
wish
me
to
perhaps
mildred
will
decide
for
both
of
us
that
is
satisfactory
to
me
very
well
we
dine
at
seven
and
we
shall
expect
you
that
wayland
had
made
no
mistake
in
his
judgment
emerson
had
soon
been
forced
to
admit
for
the
more
he
saw
of
mildred
life
the
more
plainly
he
perceived
the
barriers
that
lay
between
them
those
months
had
been
an
education
to
him
he
had
become
an
integral
part
of
chicago
richer
social
world
the
younger
set
had
accepted
him
readily
enough
on
the
score
of
his
natural
good
parts
while
the
name
of
wayne
wayland
had
acted
like
magic
upon
the
elders
yet
it
had
been
a
cruel
time
of
probation
for
the
young
lover
who
continually
felt
the
searching
eyes
of
the
old
man
reading
him
and
despite
the
fact
that
mildred
took
no
pains
to
conceal
her
preference
for
him
there
had
been
no
lack
of
other
suitors
all
of
whom
boyd
hated
with
a
perfect
hate
they
had
never
discussed
the
matter
yet
both
the
lovers
had
been
conscious
that
the
old
man
words
were
pregnant
with
truth
and
after
a
few
months
during
which
emerson
had
made
little
progress
in
his
profession
mildred
had
gone
to
her
father
and
frankly
begged
his
aid
but
he
had
remained
like
adamant
i
have
been
pretty
lenient
so
far
he
will
have
to
make
his
own
way
without
my
help
you
know
he
is
my
candidate
recognizing
the
despair
which
was
possessing
her
lover
and
jealous
for
her
own
happiness
mildred
had
arranged
that
both
of
them
together
should
have
a
talk
with
her
father
the
result
had
been
the
same
wayland
listened
grimly
then
said
this
request
for
assistance
shows
that
both
of
you
are
beginning
to
realize
the
wisdom
of
my
remarks
of
a
year
ago
i
not
asking
aid
from
you
emerson
had
blazed
forth
i
can
take
care
of
myself
and
of
mildred
permit
me
to
show
you
that
you
ca
your
life
and
training
have
not
fitted
you
for
the
position
of
mildred
husband
have
you
any
idea
how
many
millions
she
is
going
to
own
no
and
i
do
care
to
know
i
do
care
to
tell
you
either
but
the
wayland
fortune
will
carry
such
a
tremendous
responsibility
with
it
that
my
successor
will
have
to
be
a
stronger
man
than
i
am
to
hold
it
together
i
merely
gathered
it
he
must
keep
it
you
have
qualified
in
either
respect
yet
mildred
had
interrupted
petulantly
oh
this
endless
chatter
of
money
it
is
disgusting
i
only
wish
we
were
poor
instead
of
a
blessing
our
wealth
is
an
unmitigated
curse
a
terrible
exhausting
burden
i
hear
of
nothing
else
from
morning
till
night
it
gives
us
no
pleasure
nothing
but
care
and
worry
and
wrinkles
i
can
do
without
horses
and
motors
and
maids
and
all
that
i
want
to
live
really
to
she
had
arisen
and
gone
over
to
boyd
laying
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
i
will
give
it
all
up
let
us
try
to
be
happy
without
it
it
had
been
a
tense
moment
for
both
men
their
eyes
had
met
defiantly
but
reading
in
the
father
face
the
contempt
that
waited
upon
an
unmanly
decision
boyd
pride
stood
up
stiffly
no
he
replied
i
ca
let
you
do
that
not
yet
anyhow
wayland
is
right
in
a
way
if
he
had
not
been
so
decent
i
would
have
married
you
anyhow
but
i
am
indebted
to
him
he
has
shown
me
a
lot
more
of
your
life
than
i
knew
before
and
he
has
made
his
word
good
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
wait
however
for
quite
a
while
it
may
be
i
am
going
to
take
a
gambler
chance
what
is
it
a
gold
strike
has
been
made
in
alaska
alaska
yes
the
klondike
you
have
read
of
it
i
am
told
that
the
chances
there
are
like
those
in
the
days
of
and
i
am
going
so
it
was
that
he
had
made
his
choice
fixing
his
own
time
for
returning
and
so
it
was
that
mildred
wayland
had
awaited
him
if
after
three
years
of
deprivation
she
seemed
to
him
more
beautiful
than
ever
the
interval
having
served
merely
to
enhance
her
charm
and
strengthen
the
yearning
of
his
heart
she
seemed
in
the
same
view
still
further
removed
from
his
sphere
more
reserved
more
dignified
in
the
reserve
of
developed
womanhood
her
cession
was
the
more
gracious
and
wonderful
his
story
finished
boyd
went
on
to
tell
her
vaguely
of
his
future
plans
and
at
the
last
he
asked
her
with
something
less
than
an
accepted
lover
confidence
will
you
wait
another
year
she
laughed
lightly
you
dear
boy
i
am
not
up
for
auction
this
is
not
the
and
last
call
i
am
not
sure
i
could
induce
anybody
to
take
me
even
if
i
desired
i
read
the
rumor
of
your
engagement
in
a
back
number
of
a
san
francisco
paper
is
your
retinue
as
large
as
ever
she
smiled
indifferently
it
alters
with
the
season
but
i
believe
the
general
average
is
about
the
same
you
know
most
of
them
she
mentioned
a
number
of
names
counting
them
off
on
her
then
of
course
there
are
the
old
standbys
macklin
tommy
turner
the
lawton
boys
and
alton
clyde
to
be
sure
little
alton
like
the
brook
runs
on
forever
he
still
worships
you
boyd
by
the
way
and
there
are
others
a
few
who
nobody
you
know
any
one
in
particular
boyd
demanded
with
a
lover
insistence
miss
wayland
hesitation
was
so
brief
as
almost
to
escape
his
notice
nobody
who
counts
of
course
father
has
his
predilections
and
insists
upon
engineering
my
affairs
in
the
same
way
he
would
float
a
railroad
enterprise
but
you
can
imagine
how
romantic
the
result
is
who
is
the
favored
party
the
young
man
asked
darkly
but
she
arose
to
push
back
the
heavy
draperies
and
gaze
for
a
moment
out
into
the
deepening
twilight
when
she
answered
it
was
in
a
tone
of
ordinary
indifference
really
it
is
worth
discussing
i
shall
not
marry
until
i
am
ready
and
the
subject
bores
me
an
instant
later
she
turned
to
regard
him
with
direct
eyes
do
you
remember
when
i
offered
to
give
it
all
up
and
go
with
you
boyd
i
have
never
forgotten
for
an
instant
you
refused
to
allow
it
certainly
i
had
seen
too
much
of
your
life
and
my
pride
figured
a
bit
also
do
you
still
feel
the
same
way
her
eyes
searched
his
face
rather
anxiously
i
do
it
is
even
more
impossible
now
than
then
i
am
utterly
out
of
touch
with
this
environment
my
work
will
take
me
back
where
you
could
not
go
into
a
land
you
would
dislike
among
a
people
you
could
not
understand
no
we
did
quite
the
sensible
thing
she
sighed
gratefully
and
settled
upon
the
her
back
to
the
light
i
am
glad
you
feel
that
way
i
i
think
i
am
growing
more
sensible
too
i
have
begun
to
understand
how
practical
father
was
and
how
ridiculous
i
was
perhaps
i
am
not
so
impulsive
you
see
i
am
years
older
now
perhaps
i
am
more
selfish
i
do
know
which
it
is
and
i
ca
express
my
feelings
but
i
have
had
sufficient
time
since
you
went
away
to
think
and
to
look
into
my
own
soul
really
i
have
become
quite
introspective
of
course
my
feeling
for
you
is
just
the
same
as
it
was
dear
but
i
i
ca
she
waved
a
graceful
hand
to
indicate
her
surroundings
well
this
is
my
world
and
i
am
a
part
of
it
you
understand
do
you
the
thought
of
giving
it
up
makes
me
really
afraid
i
do
like
rough
things
she
shook
herself
and
gave
voice
to
a
delicious
bubbling
little
laugh
i
am
frightfully
spoiled
emerson
drew
her
to
him
tenderly
my
darling
i
understand
perfectly
and
i
love
you
too
well
to
take
you
away
from
it
all
but
you
will
wait
for
me
wo
you
of
course
she
replied
quickly
as
long
as
you
wish
but
i
am
going
to
have
you
he
cried
insistently
you
are
going
to
be
my
wife
he
repeated
the
words
softly
reverently
my
wife
she
gazed
up
at
him
with
a
puzzled
little
frown
what
bothers
me
is
that
you
understand
me
and
my
life
so
well
while
i
scarcely
understand
you
or
yours
at
all
that
seems
to
tell
me
that
i
am
unsuited
to
you
in
some
way
why
when
you
told
me
that
story
of
your
hardships
and
all
that
i
listened
as
if
it
were
a
play
or
a
book
but
really
it
anything
to
me
or
stir
me
as
it
should
i
ca
understand
my
own
failure
to
understand
that
awful
country
those
barbarous
people
the
suffering
the
cold
the
snow
the
angry
sea
i
do
grasp
what
they
mean
i
was
never
cold
or
hungry
or
exhausted
i
well
it
is
fascinating
to
hear
about
because
you
went
through
it
but
you
did
it
how
you
she
made
a
gesture
as
if
at
a
loss
for
words
do
you
see
what
i
am
trying
to
convey
perfectly
he
answered
releasing
her
with
a
little
unadmitted
sense
of
disappointment
at
his
heart
i
suppose
it
is
only
natural
i
do
hope
you
succeed
this
time
she
continued
i
am
growing
deadly
tired
of
things
not
tired
of
waiting
for
you
but
i
am
getting
to
be
old
i
am
indeed
why
at
times
i
actually
have
an
inclination
to
do
the
unfailing
symptom
do
you
realize
that
i
am
years
old
age
of
decrepitude
and
more
glorious
than
any
woman
in
the
world
he
cried
there
was
a
click
outside
the
library
door
and
the
room
which
unnoticed
by
them
had
become
nearly
dark
was
suddenly
flooded
with
light
the
portieres
parted
and
wayne
wayland
stood
in
the
opening
ah
here
you
are
my
boy
hawkins
told
me
you
had
returned
he
advanced
to
shake
the
young
man
hand
his
demeanor
gracious
and
hearty
welcome
home
you
have
been
having
quite
a
vacation
you
let
see
it
two
years
is
it
three
years
emerson
replied
impossible
dear
dear
how
time
flies
when
one
is
busy
boyd
has
been
telling
me
of
his
adventures
said
mildred
he
is
going
to
dine
with
us
indeed
wayland
displayed
no
great
degree
of
enthusiasm
and
have
you
returned
like
pizarro
laden
with
all
the
gold
of
the
incas
or
did
pizarro
return
it
seems
to
me
that
he
settled
somewhere
on
the
coast
the
old
man
laughed
at
his
own
conceit
i
judge
pizarro
was
a
better
miner
than
i
boyd
smiled
there
were
plenty
of
esquimau
princes
whom
i
might
have
held
for
ransom
but
if
i
had
done
so
all
the
rest
of
the
tribe
would
have
come
to
board
with
them
have
you
come
home
to
stay
no
sir
i
shall
return
in
a
few
weeks
wayland
cordiality
seemed
to
increase
in
some
subtle
manner
well
i
am
sorry
you
did
make
a
fortune
my
boy
but
rich
or
poor
your
friends
are
delighted
to
see
you
and
we
shall
certainly
keep
you
for
dinner
i
am
interested
in
that
northwestern
country
myself
and
i
want
to
ask
some
questions
about
it
chapter
x
in
which
big
george
meets
his
enemy
it
was
well
on
toward
midnight
when
emerson
reached
his
hotel
and
being
too
full
of
his
visit
with
mildred
to
sleep
he
strolled
through
the
lobby
and
into
the
pompeian
room
the
theatre
crowds
had
not
dispersed
and
the
place
was
for
it
was
the
season
the
room
was
so
well
filled
that
he
had
difficulty
in
finding
a
seat
and
he
made
his
way
slowly
meditating
gloomily
upon
the
fact
that
out
of
all
this
concourse
in
which
he
had
once
figured
not
a
single
familiar
face
greeted
him
finding
no
unoccupied
table
he
was
about
to
retreat
when
he
heard
his
name
spoken
and
felt
a
vigorous
slap
upon
the
back
boyd
emerson
by
jove
i
glad
to
see
you
he
turned
to
face
an
anaemic
youth
whose
colorless
face
was
wrinkled
into
an
expansive
grin
hello
alton
they
shook
hands
like
old
friends
while
alton
clyde
continued
to
express
his
delight
so
you
been
roughing
it
out
in
nebraska
eh
alaska
so
it
was
i
always
get
those
places
mixed
come
over
and
have
a
drink
i
want
to
talk
to
you
funny
thing
i
just
met
a
klondiker
myself
this
evening
great
chap
too
i
want
you
to
know
him
immense
only
watch
out
he
do
get
you
full
he
an
awful
spender
i
half
kippered
myself
his
name
is
froelich
but
he
is
a
dutchman
ever
meet
him
up
there
i
think
not
come
on
you
like
him
clyde
led
his
companion
toward
a
table
chattering
as
they
went
know
i
democratic
myself
and
i
fond
of
these
rough
fellows
like
to
go
out
to
nebraska
alaska
and
punch
cows
and
shoot
a
pistol
and
yell
i
really
tremendously
rough
here
he
is
froelich
my
old
friend
emerson
we
played
football
together
or
at
least
he
played
i
was
too
light
froelich
shoved
back
his
chair
and
turned
exposing
the
face
of
fingerless
fraser
quite
expressionless
save
for
the
left
eyelid
which
drooped
meaningly
said
boyd
angrily
good
heavens
fraser
have
you
picked
another
i
thought
you
were
going
to
stick
to
turning
to
clyde
he
observed
this
man
name
is
fraser
one
of
his
peculiarities
is
a
dislike
of
proper
names
he
has
never
found
one
that
suited
him
i
like
pretty
well
observed
the
imperturbable
fraser
it
sounds
distanguay
and
do
believe
anything
he
tells
you
boyd
broke
in
seating
himself
he
is
the
most
circumstantial
liar
in
the
northwest
and
if
you
watch
him
every
minute
he
will
sell
you
a
hydraulic
mine
or
a
rubber
plantation
or
a
sponge
fishery
underneath
his
eccentricities
however
he
is
really
a
pretty
decent
fellow
and
i
am
indebted
to
him
for
my
presence
here
alton
clyde
made
his
astonishment
evident
by
inquiring
incredulously
of
fraser
then
that
scheme
of
yours
to
establish
a
gas
plant
at
nome
was
all
certainly
emerson
laughed
the
incandescent
lamp
travels
about
as
fast
as
the
prospector
nome
is
lighted
by
electricity
and
has
been
for
years
it
demanded
fraser
with
an
assumption
of
the
supremest
surprise
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
h
i
forgotten
just
the
same
my
plan
was
a
good
one
gas
is
cheaper
he
reached
for
his
glass
at
which
clyde
eye
fell
upon
his
missing
fingers
and
the
young
clubman
exploded
well
if
that
the
kind
of
pill
you
are
maybe
you
did
lose
your
mit
in
the
boer
war
either
emerson
answered
for
the
adventurer
hardly
he
got
from
a
hangnail
clyde
began
to
laugh
uncontrollably
really
that
great
oh
lovely
here
i
been
gobbling
fairy
tales
like
a
black
bass
at
sunset
he
he
he
i
must
introduce
froel
fra
to
the
boys
he
he
he
it
was
evident
that
fraser
was
not
accustomed
to
this
sort
of
treatment
his
injured
pride
took
refuge
in
a
haughty
silence
which
further
stirred
the
risibilities
of
clyde
until
that
young
man
thin
shoulders
shook
and
he
doubled
up
his
hollow
chest
touching
his
knees
he
pounded
the
tiles
with
his
cane
stamped
his
boots
and
wept
tears
of
joy
what
the
joke
demanded
the
rogue
anybody
would
think
was
the
sucker
where
is
george
questioned
boyd
to
change
the
subject
in
his
i
suppose
said
fraser
stiffly
along
about
nine
he
begins
to
yawn
like
a
trained
seal
how
i
came
to
fall
in
with
this
he
indicated
the
giggling
clyde
i
did
have
anything
better
to
do
did
you
show
george
around
as
i
asked
sure
after
that
fairy
i
should
say
finished
his
front
feet
i
took
him
out
and
let
him
look
at
the
elevated
railroad
then
he
came
back
and
hunted
up
the
janitor
of
the
building
he
spent
the
evening
in
the
basement
with
the
engineer
oh
he
had
a
splendid
day
i
say
boyd
have
you
got
another
one
like
like
this
clyde
asked
nodding
at
fraser
who
snorted
indignantly
not
exactly
balt
is
quite
the
antithesis
of
fraser
he
is
a
fisherman
and
he
has
never
been
east
before
he
learning
the
manicure
business
sniffed
the
adventurer
he
has
his
nails
curried
every
day
says
it
tickles
oh
glory
be
ejaculated
the
clubman
i
must
meet
him
too
let
me
show
him
the
town
will
you
i
foot
the
bills
i
make
it
something
historic
please
do
i
bored
to
death
we
ca
spare
the
time
we
are
here
on
business
said
emerson
business
clyde
remarked
that
sounds
interesting
i
have
seen
anybody
for
years
who
was
really
busy
at
anything
that
was
worth
being
busy
at
it
must
be
a
great
sensation
to
really
do
something
do
you
do
anything
oh
yes
i
as
busy
as
a
but
i
do
anything
it
the
same
old
thing
leases
to
sign
rents
to
collect
and
that
sort
of
rot
my
agent
does
most
of
it
however
i
wish
i
were
like
you
boyd
you
always
were
a
lucky
chap
emerson
smiled
rather
grimly
at
thought
of
the
earlier
part
of
the
evening
and
of
his
present
fortune
oh
i
mean
it
said
clyde
look
how
lucky
you
were
at
the
university
everything
came
your
way
even
m
he
checked
himself
and
jerked
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
north
side
you
know
never
been
able
to
see
any
of
us
fellows
with
a
since
you
left
and
i
have
proposed
regularly
every
full
moon
he
wagged
his
curly
head
solemnly
and
sighed
well
there
is
only
one
man
i
rather
see
get
her
than
you
and
that
me
or
i
whichever
is
proper
i
not
sure
it
proper
for
either
of
us
to
get
her
smiled
boyd
well
i
glad
you
returned
anyhow
for
there
an
added
starter
who
is
he
he
some
primitive
western
fellow
like
yourself
i
do
know
his
name
never
met
him
in
fact
but
while
we
chicago
fellows
were
cantering
along
in
a
bunch
watching
each
other
he
got
the
rail
from
the
way
her
father
spoke
and
acted
i
judged
he
had
somebody
in
sight
boyd
eyes
were
keenly
alight
and
clyde
continued
we
just
to
keep
her
in
chicago
and
you
the
one
to
do
it
i
tell
you
old
man
she
has
missed
you
yes
sir
she
has
missed
you
a
blamed
sight
more
than
the
rest
of
us
have
oh
you
do
know
how
lucky
you
are
i
lucky
h
you
fellows
are
rich
bah
not
i
gone
through
most
of
what
i
had
all
that
is
left
are
the
rents
they
keep
me
going
after
a
fashion
now
that
it
is
too
late
i
beginning
to
wake
up
i
getting
tired
of
loafing
i
like
to
get
out
and
do
something
but
i
ca
i
too
well
known
in
chicago
and
besides
as
a
business
man
i
certainly
a
rotter
i
give
you
a
chance
to
recoup
said
boyd
i
am
here
to
raise
some
money
on
a
good
proposition
the
younger
man
leaned
forward
eagerly
if
you
say
it
good
all
i
want
to
know
i
take
a
chance
i
in
for
anything
from
to
manslaughter
i
tell
you
what
it
is
and
you
can
use
your
own
judgment
i
have
a
particle
clyde
confessed
if
i
had
i
would
need
to
invest
go
ahead
however
i
all
ears
he
pulled
his
chair
closer
and
listened
intently
while
the
other
outlined
the
plan
his
weak
gray
eyes
reflecting
the
old
of
his
college
days
to
him
boyd
emerson
had
ever
represented
the
ultimate
type
of
all
that
was
most
desirable
and
time
had
not
lessened
his
admiration
it
looks
as
if
there
might
be
a
jolly
rumpus
does
it
he
questioned
when
the
speaker
had
finished
it
does
then
i
got
to
see
it
i
put
in
my
share
if
you
let
me
go
along
you
go
why
you
would
like
that
sort
of
thing
said
emerson
considerably
nonplussed
oh
would
i
i
it
it
just
what
i
need
i
revel
in
that
life
he
threw
back
his
narrow
shoulders
i
a
regular
scout
when
it
comes
to
roughing
it
why
i
camped
in
the
thousand
islands
all
one
summer
and
i
been
in
the
adirondacks
we
did
get
any
they
were
too
far
from
the
hotel
but
i
know
all
about
mountain
life
this
is
totally
different
boyd
objected
but
clyde
ran
on
his
enthusiasm
growing
as
he
tinted
the
mental
picture
to
suit
himself
i
a
splendid
fisherman
too
and
i
plenty
of
tackle
we
shall
use
nets
do
do
it
it
is
sportsmanlike
i
take
a
book
of
flies
and
whip
that
stream
to
a
froth
emerson
interrupted
him
to
explain
briefly
the
process
of
but
the
young
man
was
not
to
be
discouraged
you
give
me
something
to
do
something
where
i
do
have
to
lift
heavy
weights
or
carry
boxes
and
watch
me
work
i
tell
you
it
what
i
been
looking
for
and
i
did
know
it
i
get
as
husky
as
you
are
and
all
sunburnt
tell
me
the
sort
of
furs
and
the
kind
of
pistols
to
buy
and
i
put
ten
thousand
dollars
in
the
scheme
that
all
i
can
spare
you
wo
need
either
furs
or
firearms
laughed
boyd
when
we
get
back
to
kalvik
the
days
will
be
long
and
hot
and
the
whole
country
will
be
a
blaze
of
wild
flowers
that
fine
i
love
flowers
if
i
ca
catch
fish
for
the
cannery
i
make
up
for
it
in
some
other
way
can
you
keep
books
no
but
i
can
play
a
mandolin
clyde
offered
optimistically
i
guess
a
little
music
would
sound
pretty
good
up
there
in
the
wilderness
can
you
play
a
mandolin
inquired
fingerless
fraser
observing
the
young
fellow
with
grave
curiosity
sure
i
out
of
practice
but
take
him
said
fraser
turning
upon
emerson
he
can
set
on
the
front
porch
of
the
cannery
with
wild
flowers
in
his
hair
and
play
it
will
make
those
other
mad
with
jealousy
get
a
and
a
hammock
and
maybe
willis
marsh
will
run
in
and
spend
his
evenings
with
you
do
josh
insisted
clyde
seriously
i
want
to
go
me
josh
fraser
face
was
like
wood
i
think
it
over
emerson
said
guardedly
without
warning
the
adventurer
burst
into
shrill
laughter
are
you
laughing
at
me
angrily
demanded
the
city
youth
fraser
composed
his
features
which
seemed
to
have
suddenly
disrupted
certainly
not
i
just
thought
of
something
that
happened
to
my
father
when
i
was
a
little
child
again
he
began
to
shake
at
which
clyde
regarded
him
narrowly
but
his
merriment
was
so
impersonal
as
to
allay
suspicion
and
the
young
fellow
went
on
with
undiminished
enthusiasm
you
think
it
over
and
in
the
mean
time
i
get
a
bunch
of
the
fellows
together
we
all
have
lunch
at
the
university
club
and
you
can
tell
them
about
the
affair
fraser
abruptly
ended
his
laughter
as
boyd
heel
came
heavily
in
contact
with
his
instep
under
the
table
clyde
was
again
lost
in
an
exposition
of
his
fitness
as
a
fisherman
when
fraser
burst
out
hello
there
george
he
walking
in
his
sleep
and
thinks
this
is
a
manicure
stable
emerson
turned
to
behold
balt
huge
figure
all
but
blocking
the
distant
door
it
was
evident
that
he
had
been
vainly
trying
to
attract
their
attention
for
some
time
but
lacked
the
courage
to
enter
the
crowded
room
for
upon
catching
boyd
eye
he
beckoned
vigorously
call
him
in
said
clyde
quickly
i
want
to
meet
him
he
looks
just
my
sort
and
accordingly
emerson
motioned
to
the
fisherman
seeing
there
was
no
help
for
it
big
george
composed
himself
and
ventured
timidly
across
the
portal
steering
a
tortuous
course
toward
his
friends
but
in
these
unaccustomed
waters
his
bulk
became
unmanageable
and
his
way
beset
with
perils
deeming
himself
in
danger
of
being
run
down
by
a
waiter
he
sheered
to
starboard
and
collided
with
a
table
at
which
there
was
a
theatre
party
endeavoring
to
apologize
he
backed
into
a
great
pottery
vase
which
rocked
at
the
impact
and
threatened
to
topple
from
its
foundation
i
rather
take
an
through
this
room
than
him
said
fraser
he
wreck
something
sure
conscious
of
the
attention
he
was
attracting
on
all
sides
big
george
became
seized
with
an
excess
of
awkwardness
his
face
blazed
and
the
perspiration
started
from
his
forehead
i
hope
the
head
waiter
does
speak
to
him
boyd
observed
he
is
mad
enough
to
rend
him
limb
from
limb
but
the
words
were
barely
spoken
when
they
saw
a
steward
hasten
toward
george
and
address
him
following
which
the
big
fellow
voice
rumbled
angrily
no
i
ai
made
any
mistake
i
a
boarder
here
and
you
get
out
of
my
way
or
i
step
on
you
he
strode
forward
threateningly
at
which
the
waiter
hopped
over
the
train
of
an
evening
dress
and
bowed
obsequiously
the
noise
of
laughter
and
many
voices
ceased
in
the
silence
george
pursued
his
way
regardless
of
personal
injury
or
property
damage
breaking
trail
as
it
were
to
his
destination
where
he
sank
limply
into
a
chair
which
creaked
beneath
his
weight
gim
me
a
lemonade
quick
i
all
het
up
he
ordered
i
ca
get
no
footholt
on
these
fancy
floors
they
so
dang
slick
after
a
acknowledgment
of
his
introduction
to
alton
clyde
he
continued
i
been
trying
to
flag
you
for
ten
minutes
he
mopped
his
brow
feebly
what
is
wrong
everything
it
too
noisy
for
me
in
this
hotel
i
been
trying
to
sleep
for
three
hours
but
this
band
keeps
playing
and
that
elevated
railroad
breaks
down
every
few
minutes
right
under
my
window
whistles
blowing
bells
ringing
and
ca
we
find
some
quiet
where
i
can
get
an
hour
rest
put
me
in
a
or
a
where
i
can
go
to
sleep
the
hotels
are
all
alike
boyd
answered
you
will
soon
get
used
to
it
who
me
never
i
want
to
get
back
to
god
country
hurrah
for
you
ejaculated
clyde
same
here
and
i
going
with
you
how
that
questioned
george
clyde
offers
to
put
ten
thousand
dollars
into
the
deal
if
he
can
go
to
kalvik
with
us
and
help
run
the
cannery
explained
emerson
george
looked
over
the
clubman
carefully
from
his
curly
crown
to
his
slender
shoes
then
smiled
broadly
it
up
to
emerson
i
willing
if
he
is
whereupon
vastly
encouraged
clyde
proceeded
to
expatiate
upon
his
own
surpassing
qualifications
while
he
was
speaking
a
party
of
three
men
approached
and
seated
themselves
at
an
adjoining
table
as
they
pulled
out
their
chairs
big
george
chanced
to
glance
in
their
direction
then
he
put
down
his
lemonade
glass
carefully
what
the
matter
boyd
demanded
in
a
low
tone
for
the
big
face
had
suddenly
gone
livid
while
his
eyes
had
widened
like
those
of
an
enraged
animal
that
him
george
growled
that
the
dirty
hound
sit
still
commanded
fraser
for
the
fisherman
had
shoved
back
from
the
table
and
was
rising
his
hands
working
hungrily
the
cords
in
his
neck
standing
out
rigidly
seeing
the
in
his
eyes
the
speaker
leaned
forward
and
thrust
the
big
fellow
back
into
the
chair
from
which
he
had
half
lifted
himself
do
make
a
fool
of
yourself
he
cautioned
clyde
who
had
likewise
witnessed
the
giant
remarkable
metamorphosis
now
inquired
its
meaning
that
him
repeated
george
his
eyes
glaring
redly
that
willis
marsh
where
emerson
whirled
curiously
but
there
was
no
need
for
george
to
point
out
his
enemy
for
one
of
the
strangers
stood
as
if
frozen
with
his
hand
upon
the
back
of
his
chair
an
expression
of
the
utmost
astonishment
upon
his
face
a
smile
was
dying
from
his
lips
boyd
beheld
a
plump
man
of
in
evening
dress
there
was
nothing
distinctive
about
him
except
perhaps
his
hair
which
was
of
a
decided
reddish
hue
he
was
light
of
complexion
his
mouth
was
small
and
of
a
rather
womanish
appearance
due
to
the
full
red
lips
he
was
well
groomed
well
fed
in
all
ways
he
was
a
typical
man
he
might
have
been
a
broker
though
he
did
not
carry
the
air
of
any
particular
profession
that
he
was
at
all
events
master
of
his
emotions
he
soon
gave
evidence
raising
his
brows
in
recognition
he
nodded
pleasantly
to
balt
then
as
if
on
second
thought
excused
himself
to
his
companions
and
stepped
toward
the
other
group
the
legs
of
george
chair
scraped
noisily
on
the
tiles
as
he
rose
the
sound
covered
fraser
quick
admonition
take
it
easy
pal
let
him
talk
how
do
you
do
george
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
are
you
doing
here
i
hardly
recognized
you
marsh
voice
was
round
and
musical
his
accent
eastern
with
an
assumption
of
heartiness
he
extended
a
hand
which
the
big
uncouth
man
who
faced
him
refused
to
take
the
other
three
had
risen
george
seemed
to
be
groping
for
a
retort
finally
he
blurted
out
hoarsely
do
offer
me
your
hand
it
dirty
it
got
blood
on
it
nonsense
marsh
smiled
let
be
friends
again
george
bygones
are
bygones
i
came
over
to
make
up
with
you
and
ask
about
affairs
at
kalvik
if
you
are
here
on
business
and
i
can
help
you
dirty
rat
breathed
the
fisherman
very
well
if
you
wish
to
be
obstinate
willis
marsh
shrugged
his
shoulders
carelessly
although
in
his
voice
there
was
a
metallic
note
i
have
nothing
to
say
he
turned
a
very
bright
and
very
curious
pair
of
eyes
upon
george
companions
as
if
seeking
from
them
some
hint
as
to
his
victim
presence
there
it
was
but
a
momentary
flash
of
inquiry
however
and
then
his
gaze
passing
quickly
over
clyde
and
fraser
settled
upon
emerson
balt
and
i
had
a
business
misunderstanding
he
said
smoothly
which
i
hoped
was
forgotten
it
did
amount
to
much
at
this
balt
uttered
a
choking
snarl
and
stepped
forward
only
to
meet
boyd
who
intercepted
him
behave
yourself
he
ordered
do
make
a
scene
and
before
the
big
fellow
could
prevent
it
he
had
linked
arms
with
him
and
swung
him
around
the
movement
was
executed
so
naturally
that
none
of
the
patrons
of
the
cafe
noticed
it
except
perhaps
as
a
preparation
for
departure
marsh
bowed
civilly
and
returned
to
his
seat
while
boyd
sauntered
toward
the
exit
his
arm
which
controlled
george
tense
as
iron
beneath
his
sleeve
he
felt
the
fisherman
great
frame
quivering
against
him
and
heard
the
excited
breath
halting
in
his
lungs
but
possessed
with
the
sole
idea
of
getting
him
away
without
disorder
he
smiled
back
at
clyde
and
fraser
who
were
following
and
chatted
agreeably
with
his
prisoner
until
they
had
reached
the
foyer
then
he
released
his
hold
and
said
quietly
you
better
go
up
to
your
room
and
cool
off
you
came
near
spoiling
everything
he
tried
to
shake
hands
george
mumbled
me
that
thieving
whelp
tried
to
shake
he
trailed
off
into
an
unintelligible
jargon
of
curses
and
threats
which
did
not
end
until
he
had
reached
the
elevator
here
alton
clyde
clamored
for
enlightenment
as
to
the
reason
for
this
eruption
that
is
the
fellow
we
will
have
to
fight
boyd
explained
he
is
the
head
of
the
cannery
combination
at
kalvik
and
a
bitter
enemy
of
george
if
he
suspects
our
motives
or
gets
wind
of
our
plans
done
for
clyde
spoke
more
earnestly
than
at
any
time
during
the
evening
well
that
absolutely
settles
it
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
this
is
bound
to
end
in
a
row
you
mean
you
do
want
to
join
us
want
to
why
i
just
to
that
all
the
ten
thousand
is
yours
but
if
you
do
take
me
along
i
stow
away
chapter
xi
wherein
boyd
emerson
is
twice
amazed
nearly
a
month
had
elapsed
when
emerson
at
last
expressed
to
george
the
discouragement
that
for
several
days
had
lain
silently
in
both
minds
it
looks
like
failure
does
it
sure
does
you
played
your
string
out
eh
absolutely
i
done
everything
except
burglary
but
i
ca
raise
that
hundred
thousand
dollars
from
the
way
we
started
off
it
looked
easy
but
times
are
hard
and
i
bled
my
friends
of
every
dollar
they
can
spare
in
fact
some
of
them
have
put
in
more
than
they
can
afford
it
an
awful
big
piece
of
money
balt
admitted
with
a
sigh
i
never
fully
realized
before
how
very
large
boyd
said
and
yet
without
that
amount
the
seattle
bank
wo
back
us
for
the
remainder
oh
it
no
use
to
tackle
the
business
on
a
small
scale
big
george
pondered
for
a
moment
we
ca
wait
much
longer
we
ought
to
be
on
the
coast
now
we
shy
thousand
dollars
eh
yes
and
i
ca
see
any
possible
way
of
raising
it
i
done
the
best
i
could
and
so
has
clyde
but
it
no
use
the
strain
of
the
past
month
was
evident
in
emerson
face
which
was
worn
and
tired
as
if
from
sleepless
nights
of
late
he
had
lapsed
again
into
that
despondent
mood
which
fraser
had
observed
in
alaska
his
moments
of
depression
growing
more
frequent
as
the
precious
days
slipped
past
every
waking
hour
he
had
devoted
to
the
promotion
of
his
enterprise
he
had
laughed
at
rebuffs
and
refused
discouragement
he
had
solicited
every
man
who
seemed
in
any
way
likely
to
be
interested
he
had
gone
from
office
to
office
his
hours
regulated
by
watch
and
always
retailing
the
same
facts
always
convincingly
lucid
and
calmly
enthusiastic
but
a
scarcity
of
money
seemed
prevalent
those
who
sought
investment
either
had
better
opportunities
or
refused
to
finance
an
undertaking
so
far
from
home
and
apparently
so
hazardous
during
those
three
years
in
the
north
boyd
had
worked
with
feverish
haste
and
suffered
many
disappointments
but
never
before
had
he
used
such
a
vast
amount
of
nervous
force
as
in
this
short
month
never
had
fortune
seemed
so
maddeningly
stubborn
but
he
had
hung
on
with
bulldog
tenacity
not
knowing
how
to
give
up
until
at
last
he
had
placed
his
stock
to
the
extent
of
thousand
dollars
only
to
realize
that
he
had
exhausted
his
vital
force
as
well
as
his
list
of
acquaintances
in
public
he
maintained
a
sanguine
front
but
in
private
he
let
go
and
only
his
two
alaskan
friends
had
sounded
the
depths
of
his
disappointment
one
other
to
be
sure
had
some
inkling
of
what
troubled
him
yet
to
mildred
he
had
never
explained
the
precise
nature
of
his
difficulties
she
did
not
even
know
his
plans
he
spent
many
evenings
with
her
and
she
would
have
given
him
more
of
her
society
had
he
consented
to
go
out
with
her
for
the
demands
upon
her
time
were
numerous
but
this
he
could
never
bring
himself
to
do
being
too
wearied
in
mind
and
body
and
wishing
to
spare
himself
any
additional
mental
disquiet
neither
mildred
nor
her
father
ever
spoke
of
that
unknown
suitor
in
his
presence
and
their
very
silence
invested
the
mysterious
man
with
menacing
possibilities
which
did
not
tend
to
soothe
boyd
troubled
mind
in
fact
wayland
despite
his
genial
manner
inspired
him
with
a
vague
sense
of
hostility
and
as
if
he
were
not
sufficiently
distracted
by
all
this
fraser
and
george
kept
him
in
a
constant
state
of
worry
from
other
causes
the
former
was
continually
involving
him
in
some
wildly
impossible
enterprise
which
seemed
ever
in
danger
of
police
interference
he
could
not
get
rid
of
the
fellow
for
fraser
calmly
included
him
in
all
his
machinations
dragging
him
in
until
in
boyd
ears
there
sounded
the
distant
clank
of
chains
and
the
echo
of
the
warden
tread
a
dozen
times
he
had
exposed
the
rogue
and
established
his
own
position
only
to
find
himself
the
next
day
wallowing
in
some
new
complication
more
difficult
than
that
from
which
he
had
escaped
ordinarily
it
would
have
been
laughable
but
at
this
crisis
it
was
tragic
as
for
george
he
had
been
very
quiet
since
the
night
of
his
encounter
with
marsh
and
he
spent
much
of
his
time
by
himself
this
was
a
relief
to
boyd
until
he
happened
several
times
to
meet
the
big
fellow
in
strange
places
at
unexpected
hours
surprising
in
his
eyes
a
look
of
expectant
watchfulness
the
meaning
of
which
at
first
puzzled
him
it
took
but
little
observation
however
to
learn
that
the
fisherman
spent
his
days
in
hotel
lobbies
always
walking
about
through
the
crowd
and
that
by
night
he
patrolled
the
theatre
district
slinking
about
as
if
to
avoid
observation
emerson
finally
realized
with
a
shock
that
george
was
in
search
of
his
enemy
but
no
amount
of
argument
could
alter
the
fellow
mind
and
he
continued
to
hunt
with
the
silence
of
a
lone
wolf
what
the
result
of
his
meeting
marsh
would
be
boyd
hesitated
to
think
but
neither
george
nor
he
discovered
any
trace
of
that
gentleman
these
various
cares
added
to
the
consequences
of
his
inability
to
finance
the
cannery
project
had
reduced
emerson
to
a
state
bordering
upon
collapse
balt
had
entered
his
room
that
morning
for
his
daily
report
of
progress
and
after
his
partner
confession
of
failure
had
fetched
a
deep
sigh
well
it
tough
after
all
we
went
through
he
said
then
after
a
pause
cherry
will
be
i
had
thought
of
her
confessed
the
other
you
see
it
her
last
chance
too
so
she
told
me
i
sorry
i
brought
you
all
these
thousands
of
miles
on
a
chase
but
i
do
care
for
myself
i
get
back
somehow
and
live
in
the
brush
like
i
used
to
and
some
day
i
get
my
chance
but
she
a
woman
and
she
ca
fight
marsh
like
i
can
just
who
or
what
is
she
boyd
inquired
curiously
glad
of
anything
to
divert
his
thoughts
from
their
present
channel
she
just
a
girl
and
the
only
person
red
white
or
yellow
who
gave
me
a
kind
word
or
a
bite
to
eat
till
you
came
along
that
all
i
know
about
her
i
have
gone
crazy
only
for
her
the
big
man
ground
his
teeth
as
the
memory
of
his
injuries
came
uppermost
before
boyd
could
follow
the
subject
further
alton
clyde
strolled
in
upon
them
arrayed
immaculately
with
gloves
tie
spats
and
a
derby
to
match
a
striped
waistcoast
and
a
salutations
he
began
i
just
ran
in
to
settle
the
details
of
our
trip
i
want
my
tailor
to
get
busy
on
my
wardrobe
boyd
shook
his
head
ai
going
to
be
no
wardrobe
said
balt
why
has
something
happened
to
scare
the
fish
i
ca
raise
the
money
emerson
confessed
still
shy
that
thou
questioned
the
clubman
yes
i
done
that
a
shame
i
had
some
ripping
clothes
planned
english
that
stuff
wo
rip
george
declared
but
is
plenty
good
clyde
tapped
the
narrow
points
of
his
shoes
with
his
frowning
in
meditation
i
all
in
and
so
are
the
rest
of
the
fellows
by
jove
this
will
be
a
disappointment
to
mildred
have
you
told
her
no
she
does
know
anything
about
the
plan
and
i
did
want
to
tell
her
until
i
had
the
money
now
i
ca
go
to
her
and
acknowledge
another
failure
i
terribly
disappointed
said
clyde
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
he
went
to
the
telephone
and
called
the
hotel
office
get
me
a
cab
at
once
clyde
i
be
right
down
turning
to
the
others
he
remarked
i
see
what
i
can
do
but
as
a
promoter
i
a
joke
however
the
trip
will
do
me
good
and
i
am
hungry
for
the
fray
the
smell
of
battle
is
in
my
nostrils
and
i
am
champing
at
my
bit
woof
leave
it
to
me
he
smote
the
air
with
his
slender
cane
and
made
for
the
door
with
an
appearance
of
fierce
determination
upon
his
colorless
face
you
hear
from
me
in
the
morning
so
long
his
martial
air
amused
the
two
but
boyd
soon
dismissed
him
from
his
mind
and
spent
that
evening
in
such
moody
silence
that
in
desperation
big
george
forsook
him
and
sought
out
the
manicure
parlor
fraser
was
busied
on
some
enterprise
of
his
own
the
thought
of
alton
clyde
raising
thousand
dollars
where
he
had
failed
was
ridiculous
to
emerson
he
was
utterly
astounded
when
that
radiantly
attired
youth
strolled
into
his
room
on
the
following
morning
and
tossed
a
thick
roll
of
bills
upon
the
table
saying
carelessly
there
it
is
count
it
what
notes
anyhow
i
think
there
are
of
them
but
i
not
sure
i
counted
them
twice
once
i
made
and
the
next
time
but
i
had
my
gloves
on
so
i
struck
an
averages
and
took
the
paying
teller
word
for
it
emerson
leaped
to
his
feet
staring
at
the
dandy
as
if
not
comprehending
this
sudden
turn
of
fortune
did
you
rustle
this
money
without
any
help
he
demanded
is
it
your
own
well
hardly
it
is
so
far
from
it
that
i
was
sorely
tempted
to
spread
my
wings
and
soar
to
foreign
parts
it
would
have
taken
much
of
a
nudge
to
butt
me
clear
over
into
canada
this
morning
where
in
the
world
did
you
get
it
al
what
difference
does
that
make
i
it
did
i
he
slapped
his
trousers
leg
daintily
with
his
stick
you
can
issue
the
stock
in
my
name
boyd
seized
the
little
fellow
and
whirled
him
around
the
room
laughing
gleefully
lifted
in
one
moment
from
the
pit
of
despair
to
the
height
of
optimism
stop
it
i
all
rumpled
gasped
clyde
finally
sinking
into
a
chair
when
i
get
rumpled
in
the
morning
i
stay
rumpled
all
day
do
you
touch
me
whose
money
is
this
what
good
angel
took
pity
on
us
clyde
faded
eyes
dropped
well
i
turned
a
trick
and
to
all
intents
and
purposes
it
is
mine
there
it
is
i
did
steal
it
and
you
have
to
know
do
you
that
is
why
i
got
the
check
cashed
i
beg
your
pardon
boyd
apologized
i
did
mean
to
pry
into
your
affairs
and
it
is
none
of
my
business
anyhow
i
glad
enough
to
get
the
money
no
matter
where
it
came
from
i
forgive
you
if
you
had
stolen
it
he
began
to
dress
hurriedly
you
are
the
fairy
prince
of
this
enterprise
alton
and
you
can
go
to
kalvik
and
pick
flowers
or
play
the
mandolin
or
do
anything
you
wish
now
for
a
telegram
to
the
bank
at
seattle
we
leave
oh
here
now
i
ca
get
my
wardrobe
ready
ward
nothing
you
do
need
any
clothes
you
can
get
all
that
stuff
in
seattle
must
have
wardrobe
firmly
maintained
clyde
no
can
do
without
george
and
i
will
be
in
seattle
for
several
weeks
so
you
can
come
on
later
no
sir
i
going
to
trail
my
bet
with
yours
i
might
change
my
mind
if
i
hung
around
here
alone
i
make
my
tailor
work
all
night
it
will
do
him
good
but
it
upsets
me
to
be
hurried
it
upsets
me
worse
than
being
rumpled
in
the
morning
that
was
a
busy
day
for
boyd
emerson
but
he
was
too
elated
to
notice
fatigue
even
while
dressing
for
the
waylands
he
had
arranged
to
come
an
hour
before
dinner
that
mildred
and
he
might
have
a
little
time
to
themselves
and
his
haste
to
acquaint
her
with
the
news
of
his
success
brought
him
to
the
lake
shore
house
ahead
of
time
she
did
not
keep
him
waiting
however
and
when
she
appeared
gowned
for
dinner
he
fairly
swept
her
off
her
feet
with
his
abruptness
it
a
go
my
lady
i
have
succeeded
i
knew
it
by
your
smile
i
am
so
glad
yes
i
have
all
the
money
i
need
and
i
am
off
for
the
coast
oh
she
drew
back
from
him
why
you
wretch
you
seem
actually
glad
of
it
i
am
confusion
of
all
the
discourteous
lovers
she
simulated
such
an
expression
of
injury
that
his
dancing
eyes
became
grave
my
poor
heart
are
you
sorry
sorry
indeed
la
la
she
gave
a
dainty
french
shrug
of
her
bare
shoulders
and
tossed
her
head
i
summon
my
pride
my
spirit
is
aroused
i
rejoice
i
laugh
i
sing
sorry
pooh
then
she
melted
with
an
impulsiveness
rare
in
her
saying
tell
me
all
about
it
please
tell
me
everything
he
held
her
slender
hand
this
morning
i
was
bluer
than
a
tatooed
man
but
i
am
in
the
clouds
for
i
have
overcome
the
greatest
obstacle
that
stands
between
us
it
is
only
a
question
of
months
now
until
i
can
come
to
your
father
with
sufficient
means
to
satisfy
him
of
course
there
are
chances
of
failure
but
i
do
admit
them
i
have
such
a
superabundance
of
courage
now
that
i
ca
imagine
defeat
do
you
know
she
said
hesitatingly
you
have
never
told
me
anything
about
this
plan
of
yours
you
have
never
takes
me
into
your
confidence
in
the
slightest
degree
i
did
think
you
would
care
to
know
the
details
dear
this
is
so
entirely
a
business
matter
it
is
so
sordidly
commonplace
and
you
are
so
very
far
removed
from
sordid
things
that
i
did
think
you
would
care
to
hear
of
it
my
mind
wo
associate
you
with
commercialism
i
have
always
burned
incense
to
you
i
have
always
seen
you
in
shaded
light
and
through
the
smoke
of
altar
fires
so
to
speak
i
realize
that
i
do
appreciate
the
things
that
you
have
done
said
the
girl
but
i
should
like
to
know
more
about
this
new
adventure
i
warn
you
it
is
not
romantic
he
smiled
although
to
me
anything
which
brings
me
closer
to
you
is
invested
with
the
very
essence
of
romance
he
told
her
briefly
of
his
enterprise
and
the
difficulties
he
had
conquered
it
looks
like
plain
sailing
now
he
concluded
i
will
have
to
work
hard
but
that
just
suits
me
for
it
will
occupy
the
time
while
i
am
away
from
you
there
will
be
no
mail
or
communication
with
the
outside
world
after
we
sail
except
at
long
intervals
but
i
am
sure
you
will
feel
the
messages
i
shall
send
you
every
hour
and
so
you
are
going
to
put
fish
into
little
tin
cans
said
mildred
very
prosy
is
it
of
course
you
will
have
men
to
do
it
you
wo
do
that
sort
of
thing
yourself
assuredly
not
there
will
be
some
hundreds
of
chinese
will
you
have
to
catch
the
fish
will
you
pull
on
a
long
i
should
think
that
would
be
rather
nice
no
he
laughed
at
any
rate
you
will
wear
oilskins
and
a
wo
you
yes
just
like
the
pictures
you
see
on
she
meditated
for
an
instant
why
do
you
build
a
railroad
or
do
something
such
as
father
does
he
makes
a
great
deal
of
money
out
of
railroads
he
is
also
a
director
in
the
largest
packing
concern
at
the
stock
yards
boyd
reminded
her
this
is
much
the
same
sort
of
thing
to
be
sure
do
you
know
he
has
become
greatly
interested
in
your
country
of
late
i
have
heard
him
speak
of
alaska
frequently
in
fact
i
think
that
is
one
reason
why
he
has
been
so
nice
to
you
he
wants
to
learn
all
he
can
about
it
why
oh
dear
i
never
know
why
he
does
anything
tell
me
does
he
still
legislate
in
favor
of
this
mysterious
suitor
whose
identity
you
have
never
revealed
to
me
nonsense
said
the
girl
there
is
no
mysterious
suitor
and
father
does
not
legislate
for
or
against
any
one
he
is
that
sort
and
yet
i
never
seem
to
meet
this
stranger
indeed
she
observed
a
trifle
indifferently
it
is
your
own
fault
you
never
go
out
any
more
however
you
wo
have
long
to
wait
father
telephoned
that
he
is
to
dine
with
us
yes
but
mildred
this
is
our
last
evening
together
said
emerson
seriously
ca
we
have
it
alone
i
am
afraid
not
i
had
nothing
to
say
in
the
matter
it
is
some
business
affair
so
the
fellow
was
a
business
associate
of
the
magnate
thought
boyd
who
is
he
he
is
merely
mildred
paused
to
listen
here
they
are
now
please
do
look
so
tragic
othello
hearing
voices
outside
the
library
the
young
man
asked
hurriedly
give
me
some
time
alone
with
you
my
lady
i
must
leave
early
we
will
come
in
here
while
they
are
smoking
she
said
there
was
time
for
no
more
for
wayne
wayland
entered
followed
by
another
gentleman
at
the
first
sight
of
whom
emerson
started
while
his
mind
raced
off
into
a
dizzy
whirl
of
incredulity
it
could
not
be
it
was
too
grotesque
too
ridiculous
what
prank
of
malicious
fate
was
this
he
turned
his
eyes
to
the
door
again
to
see
if
by
any
chance
there
were
a
third
visitor
but
there
was
not
and
he
was
forced
to
respond
to
wayland
greeting
the
other
man
had
meanwhile
stepped
directly
to
mildred
as
if
he
had
eyes
for
no
one
else
and
was
bowing
over
her
hand
when
her
father
spoke
emerson
let
me
present
you
to
marsh
i
believe
you
have
never
happened
to
meet
here
marsh
turned
as
if
reluctant
to
release
the
girl
hand
and
not
until
his
own
was
outstretched
did
he
recognize
the
other
even
then
he
betrayed
his
recognition
only
by
a
slight
lift
of
the
eyebrows
and
an
intensification
of
his
glance
the
two
mumbled
the
customary
salutations
while
their
eyes
met
at
their
first
encounter
boyd
had
considered
marsh
rather
indistinct
in
type
but
with
a
lover
jealousy
he
now
beheld
a
rival
endowed
with
many
disquieting
attributes
you
two
will
get
along
famously
said
wayland
marsh
is
acquainted
with
your
country
boyd
ah
marsh
exclaimed
quickly
are
you
an
alaskan
mr
emerson
indeed
he
is
so
wedded
to
the
country
that
he
is
going
back
mildred
offered
marsh
first
look
of
challenge
now
changed
to
one
of
the
liveliest
interest
and
boyd
imagined
the
fellow
endeavoring
to
link
him
through
the
affair
at
the
restaurant
with
the
presence
of
big
george
in
chicago
although
the
full
significance
of
the
meeting
had
not
struck
the
young
lover
yet
upon
the
heels
of
his
first
surprise
came
the
realization
that
this
man
was
to
be
not
only
his
rival
in
love
but
the
greatest
menace
to
the
success
of
his
venture
that
venture
which
meant
the
world
to
him
yes
he
answered
cautiously
i
am
a
typical
alaskan
disappointed
but
not
discouraged
what
business
mining
oh
indifferently
marsh
addressed
himself
to
wayland
i
told
you
the
commercial
opportunities
in
that
country
were
far
greater
than
those
in
the
mining
business
all
miners
have
the
same
story
sensing
the
slight
in
his
tone
rather
than
in
his
words
mildred
hastened
to
the
defence
of
her
fiance
nearly
causing
disaster
thereby
boyd
has
something
far
better
than
mining
now
he
was
telling
me
about
it
as
you
interrupted
us
interjected
emerson
panic
stricken
i
have
time
to
explain
the
nature
of
my
enterprise
the
girl
was
about
to
put
in
a
disclaimer
when
he
flashed
a
look
at
her
which
she
could
not
help
but
heed
i
am
very
stupid
about
such
things
she
offered
easily
i
would
not
have
understood
it
i
am
sure
to
her
father
she
continued
leaving
what
she
felt
to
be
dangerous
ground
i
did
look
for
you
so
early
we
finished
sooner
than
i
expected
wayland
answered
so
i
drove
willis
to
his
hotel
and
waited
for
him
to
dress
i
was
afraid
he
might
disappoint
us
if
i
let
him
out
of
my
sight
i
could
allow
that
not
of
all
nights
eh
the
magnate
laughed
knowingly
at
marsh
i
have
never
yet
disappointed
miss
wayland
and
i
never
shall
the
replied
eying
the
girl
in
such
a
way
that
boyd
felt
a
sudden
desire
to
choke
him
until
his
smooth
expressionless
face
matched
the
color
of
his
evening
coat
i
can
imagine
your
daughter
feminine
guests
staying
away
wayland
but
her
masculine
friends
never
what
rot
thought
emerson
well
i
could
take
any
chances
the
father
reasserted
for
this
is
a
celebration
i
will
tell
hawkins
to
open
a
bottle
of
that
private
cuvee
what
machinations
have
you
precious
conspirators
been
at
now
queried
mildred
my
dear
i
have
effected
a
wonderful
deal
said
her
father
with
the
help
of
marsh
i
closed
the
last
details
of
a
consolidation
which
has
occupied
me
for
many
months
another
trust
i
suppose
certain
people
might
call
it
that
chuckled
the
old
man
willis
was
the
inspiring
genius
and
did
most
of
the
work
the
credit
is
his
not
at
all
not
at
all
disclaimed
the
modest
marsh
i
was
but
a
child
in
your
father
hands
miss
wayland
he
has
given
me
a
liberal
education
in
finance
it
was
a
beautiful
affair
eh
questioned
the
magnate
wonderful
may
i
inquire
the
nature
of
this
merger
emerson
ventured
amazed
at
this
disclosure
of
the
intimate
relations
existing
between
the
two
certainly
replied
wayne
wayland
there
is
no
longer
any
secret
about
it
and
the
papers
will
be
full
of
the
story
in
the
morning
i
have
combined
the
packing
industries
of
the
pacific
coast
under
the
name
of
the
north
american
packers
association
boyd
felt
himself
growing
numb
what
do
you
mean
by
industries
asked
mildred
canneries
salmon
fisheries
we
own
sixty
per
cent
of
the
plants
of
the
entire
coast
including
alaska
that
why
i
been
so
keen
about
that
north
country
boyd
you
never
guessed
it
eh
no
sir
boyd
stammered
well
we
control
the
supply
and
we
will
regulate
the
market
we
will
allow
only
what
competition
we
desire
oh
it
is
all
in
our
hands
it
was
a
beautiful
transaction
and
one
of
the
largest
i
ever
effected
was
he
dreaming
boyd
wondered
his
mouth
was
dry
but
he
managed
to
inquire
what
about
the
independent
canneries
marsh
laughed
there
is
no
sentiment
in
business
there
are
about
forty
per
cent
too
many
plants
to
suit
us
i
believe
i
am
capable
of
attending
to
them
marsh
is
the
general
manager
wayland
explained
with
the
market
in
our
own
hands
and
sufficient
capital
to
operate
at
a
loss
for
a
year
or
two
years
if
necessary
i
do
think
the
independent
plants
will
cost
us
much
emerson
found
his
sweetheart
eyes
fixed
upon
him
oddly
she
turned
to
her
father
and
said
i
consider
that
positively
criminal
tut
tut
my
dear
it
sounds
cruel
of
course
but
it
is
business
and
it
is
being
done
every
day
is
it
boyd
boyd
made
no
answer
but
marsh
hastened
to
add
you
see
miss
wayland
business
in
the
last
analysis
is
merely
a
survival
of
the
fittest
only
the
strong
and
merciless
can
hold
their
own
exactly
confirmed
her
father
one
ca
allow
sentiment
to
affect
one
it
is
business
but
you
do
understand
such
things
now
if
you
young
people
will
excuse
me
i
shall
remove
the
grime
of
toil
and
return
like
a
giant
refreshed
he
chuckled
to
himself
and
left
the
room
highly
pleased
with
the
events
of
the
day
chapter
xii
in
which
miss
wayland
is
of
two
minds
that
willis
marsh
still
retained
some
curiosity
regarding
presence
at
the
annex
on
that
night
four
weeks
before
and
that
the
young
man
reply
to
his
inquiry
about
the
new
enterprise
mentioned
by
mildred
had
not
entirely
satisfied
him
was
proved
by
the
remark
which
he
addressed
to
the
girl
the
moment
her
father
departure
afforded
him
an
opportunity
you
said
emerson
new
proposition
was
better
than
mining
did
you
not
he
was
the
embodiment
of
friendly
interest
showing
just
the
proper
degree
of
complaisant
expectancy
i
am
decidedly
curious
to
know
what
undertaking
is
sufficiently
momentous
to
draw
a
young
man
away
from
beauty
side
up
into
such
a
wilderness
particularly
in
the
dead
of
winter
miss
wayland
guarded
reply
gave
emerson
a
moment
in
which
to
collect
his
thoughts
he
was
still
too
much
confused
by
the
recent
disclosures
to
adjust
himself
fully
to
the
situation
the
one
idea
uppermost
in
his
mind
was
to
enlighten
marsh
as
little
as
possible
for
if
this
new
train
of
events
was
really
to
prove
his
undoing
as
already
he
half
believed
he
would
at
any
rate
save
himself
from
the
humiliation
of
acknowledging
defeat
if
on
the
other
hand
he
should
decide
to
go
ahead
and
wage
war
against
the
trust
as
an
independent
packer
then
secrecy
for
the
present
was
doubly
imperative
once
marsh
gained
an
inkling
that
he
and
big
george
were
equipping
themselves
to
go
back
to
kalvik
to
kalvik
marsh
own
stronghold
of
all
places
he
could
and
would
thwart
them
without
doubt
these
thoughts
flashed
through
boyd
mind
with
bewildering
rapidity
yet
he
managed
to
equal
the
other
show
of
polite
indifference
as
he
remarked
i
am
not
far
enough
along
with
my
plans
to
discuss
them
perhaps
if
i
knew
their
nature
i
might
boyd
laughed
i
am
afraid
a
hydraulic
proposition
would
not
interest
such
a
business
man
as
you
to
himself
he
added
good
heavens
i
am
worse
than
fraser
with
his
nebulous
schemes
oh
hydraulic
mining
well
hardly
the
other
replied
i
understood
miss
wayland
to
say
that
this
was
something
better
than
a
mine
is
a
hydraulic
a
mine
inquired
mildred
i
thought
it
was
a
of
some
sort
once
a
miner
always
a
miner
the
younger
man
quoted
lightly
as
if
with
a
shadow
of
doubt
marsh
next
inquired
did
i
meet
you
the
other
evening
at
the
annex
boyd
admitted
the
fact
with
the
air
of
one
who
exaggerates
his
interest
in
a
trifling
topic
for
the
sake
of
conversation
he
was
beginning
to
be
surprised
at
his
own
powers
of
dissimulation
and
you
were
with
george
balt
exactly
i
picked
him
up
on
my
way
out
from
nome
he
was
so
thoroughly
disgusted
with
alaska
that
i
helped
him
get
back
to
the
states
marsh
eyes
gleamed
at
this
welcome
intelligence
for
certain
misgivings
had
preyed
upon
him
since
that
night
of
the
encounter
he
turned
to
the
girl
with
the
explanation
this
fellow
we
speak
of
is
a
queer
unbalanced
savage
who
nurses
an
insane
hatred
for
me
i
employed
him
once
but
had
to
discharge
him
for
incompetence
and
he
has
threatened
my
life
repeatedly
you
may
imagine
the
start
it
gave
me
to
stroll
into
a
cafe
at
this
distance
from
kalvik
and
find
him
seated
at
a
table
how
strange
miss
wayland
observed
what
did
he
do
emerson
prevented
him
from
making
a
scene
only
for
his
interference
i
might
have
been
forced
to
protect
myself
in
spite
of
himself
boyd
could
not
but
wonder
if
marsh
were
really
the
sort
of
man
he
had
been
painted
or
if
as
might
appear
sufficiently
credible
he
had
been
maligned
through
cherry
prejudice
and
george
balt
hatred
he
seemed
the
most
kindly
and
courteous
of
men
under
mildred
skilful
direction
the
conversation
had
drifted
into
other
channels
by
the
time
wayland
returned
now
all
at
once
boyd
beheld
the
magnate
in
a
new
guise
until
he
had
seen
in
him
nothing
more
than
a
prospective
a
stubborn
dominant
old
fellow
whose
toleration
unpleasant
enough
at
times
never
really
amounted
to
active
enmity
now
however
he
recognized
in
wayne
wayland
a
commercial
foe
and
his
knowledge
of
the
character
gave
sufficient
assurance
that
he
might
expect
no
mercy
or
consideration
from
him
one
moment
after
it
transpired
that
their
financial
interests
were
in
conflict
so
far
the
two
had
never
seriously
clashed
but
sooner
or
later
the
capitalist
must
learn
the
truth
and
when
he
did
when
that
autocrat
once
discovered
that
this
youth
whom
he
had
taken
into
his
home
with
so
little
thought
of
possible
harm
had
actually
dared
to
oppose
him
his
indignation
would
pass
all
bounds
and
then
for
the
first
time
emerson
realized
the
impropriety
of
his
own
present
position
he
was
here
under
false
pretences
they
had
bared
to
him
secrets
not
rightly
his
with
which
he
might
arm
himself
when
this
too
became
known
to
the
financier
he
would
regard
him
not
only
as
a
presumptuous
enemy
but
as
a
traitor
boyd
knew
the
old
tyrant
too
well
to
doubt
his
course
of
action
thenceforth
there
would
be
war
to
the
hilt
the
enterprise
which
an
hour
ago
had
seemed
so
certain
of
success
the
enterprise
which
he
had
fathered
at
such
cost
of
labor
and
suffering
now
seemed
entirely
hopeless
the
futility
of
trying
to
oppose
these
men
equipped
as
they
were
with
limitless
means
and
experience
struck
him
with
such
force
as
to
make
him
almost
physically
faint
and
sick
even
had
his
canning
plant
been
open
and
running
he
knew
that
they
would
never
take
him
in
wayne
wayland
consistent
attitude
toward
him
showed
that
plainly
enough
and
with
nothing
more
tangible
to
offer
than
a
dream
they
would
laugh
him
to
scorn
furthermore
they
had
proclaimed
their
determination
to
choke
all
rivalry
a
sort
of
panic
seized
boyd
if
his
present
scheme
fell
through
what
else
could
he
do
whither
could
he
turn
even
for
his
own
livelihood
except
back
to
the
hateful
isolation
of
a
miner
life
that
would
mean
other
years
as
black
as
those
just
ended
there
had
been
a
time
when
he
could
boldly
have
taken
the
bit
in
his
teeth
and
forced
wayland
to
reckon
with
him
but
since
his
return
mildred
herself
had
withdrawn
her
consent
to
a
marriage
that
would
mean
immediate
separation
from
the
life
that
she
loved
that
course
therefore
was
closed
to
him
if
ever
he
was
to
win
her
he
must
play
this
game
of
desperate
chances
to
the
end
the
announcement
of
dinner
interrupted
his
dismayed
reflections
and
he
walked
out
in
company
with
wayland
who
linked
arms
with
him
as
if
to
afford
willis
marsh
every
advantage
fleeting
though
it
might
prove
he
is
a
wonderful
fellow
the
old
gentleman
observed
indicating
marsh
one
of
the
keenest
business
men
i
ever
met
yes
indeed
he
is
he
is
a
too
his
associates
swear
by
him
if
i
were
you
my
boy
i
would
study
him
he
is
a
good
man
to
imitate
at
the
the
talk
at
first
was
general
and
of
a
character
appropriate
for
the
hour
but
miss
wayland
oddly
enough
seemed
bent
upon
leading
the
discussion
back
into
its
former
course
and
displayed
such
an
unusual
thirst
for
information
regarding
the
north
american
packers
association
that
her
father
was
moved
to
remark
upon
it
what
in
the
world
has
come
over
you
mildred
he
said
you
never
cared
to
hear
about
my
doings
before
please
do
discourage
me
she
urged
i
am
really
in
earnest
i
should
like
to
know
all
about
this
new
trust
of
yours
perhaps
my
little
universe
is
growing
a
bit
tiresome
to
me
miss
mildred
is
truly
your
daughter
marsh
observed
admiringly
but
i
fear
the
matter
does
interest
mr
emerson
oh
indeed
it
does
mildred
smilingly
responded
does
it
boyd
he
flushed
uncomfortably
as
he
acquiesced
now
please
tell
me
more
about
it
the
girl
went
on
you
know
you
are
both
full
of
the
thing
and
there
are
only
we
four
here
so
be
natural
i
am
dreadfully
tired
of
being
conventional
tut
tut
exclaimed
her
father
that
comes
of
association
with
these
untamed
westerners
yet
he
plainly
showed
that
he
was
flattered
by
her
unexpected
enthusiasm
and
more
than
ready
to
humor
her
both
men
in
truth
were
jubilant
and
so
thoroughly
in
tune
with
the
subject
which
had
obsessed
them
these
past
months
that
it
took
little
urging
to
set
them
talking
in
harmony
with
the
girl
wishes
readily
accepting
the
cue
of
informality
they
grew
communicative
and
told
of
the
troubles
they
had
encountered
in
launching
the
gigantic
combination
joking
over
the
obstacles
that
had
threatened
to
wreck
it
and
complimenting
each
other
upon
their
persistence
and
sagacity
meanwhile
emerson
discomfort
steadily
increased
he
wondered
if
this
were
a
deliberate
effort
on
mildred
part
or
if
she
really
had
any
idea
of
what
bearing
it
all
had
upon
his
plans
the
further
it
went
however
the
more
clearly
he
perceived
the
formidable
nature
of
the
new
barrier
between
himself
and
mildred
which
her
father
had
unwittingly
raised
so
far
it
has
been
all
hard
work
wayne
wayland
at
length
announced
but
in
the
future
i
propose
to
derive
some
pleasure
from
this
affair
i
am
tired
out
for
a
long
time
i
have
been
planning
a
trip
somewhere
and
now
i
think
i
shall
make
a
tour
of
inspection
in
the
spring
and
visit
the
various
holdings
of
the
north
american
packers
association
in
that
way
i
can
combine
recreation
and
business
but
you
detest
travel
as
much
as
i
do
said
mildred
this
would
be
entirely
different
from
ordinary
travel
the
first
has
his
yacht
on
the
pacific
coast
and
offers
her
to
the
board
of
directors
for
a
summer
cruise
how
far
will
you
go
questioned
boyd
clear
up
to
marsh
station
kalvik
yes
that
is
the
plan
marsh
chimed
in
the
scenery
is
more
marvellous
than
that
of
norway
the
weather
is
delightful
moreover
grande
is
the
yacht
on
the
pacific
so
the
board
of
directors
can
take
their
families
with
them
and
enjoy
a
wonderful
outing
among
the
fjords
and
glaciers
beneath
the
midnight
sun
you
see
i
am
selfish
in
urging
it
miss
wayland
i
expect
you
to
join
the
party
i
am
sure
you
would
like
it
mildred
the
magnate
added
boyd
could
scarcely
believe
his
ears
would
they
come
to
kalvik
would
they
all
assemble
there
in
that
unmapped
nook
and
suppose
they
should
had
he
the
courage
to
continue
his
mad
enterprise
it
was
all
so
unreal
he
was
torn
between
the
desire
to
have
mildred
agree
and
fear
of
the
influence
marsh
might
gain
during
such
a
trip
but
miss
wayland
evidently
had
an
eye
to
her
own
comfort
for
she
replied
no
indeed
the
one
thing
i
abhor
above
land
travel
is
a
sea
voyage
i
am
a
wretched
sailor
but
this
trip
would
be
worth
while
urged
her
father
why
it
will
be
a
regular
voyage
of
discovery
i
am
as
excited
over
it
as
a
country
boy
on
circus
day
marsh
seconded
him
with
all
his
powers
of
persuasion
but
the
girl
greatly
to
emerson
surprise
merely
reaffirmed
her
determination
oh
i
dare
say
i
should
enjoy
the
scenery
she
observed
with
a
glance
at
boyd
but
on
the
other
hand
i
do
care
for
rough
things
and
i
prefer
hearing
about
canneries
to
visiting
them
they
must
be
very
smelly
above
all
i
simply
refuse
to
be
seasick
in
her
eyes
was
a
look
which
emerson
had
never
seen
there
before
i
am
sorry
marsh
acknowledged
frankly
you
see
there
are
no
women
in
our
country
and
six
months
without
a
word
or
a
smile
from
your
gentle
sex
makes
a
man
ready
to
hate
himself
and
his
are
there
no
women
in
alaska
questioned
the
girl
in
the
yes
but
we
fishermen
live
lonely
lives
but
the
coy
shrinking
indian
maidens
i
have
read
about
them
they
are
terrible
affairs
marsh
declared
they
are
flat
of
nose
their
lips
are
pierced
and
they
are
very
well
dirty
not
always
boyd
gave
voice
to
his
general
annoyance
and
growing
dislike
for
marsh
in
an
abrupt
denial
i
have
seen
some
very
attractive
squaws
particularly
breeds
where
demanded
the
other
sceptically
well
at
kalvik
for
instance
kalvik
ejaculated
marsh
yes
your
home
you
must
know
chakawana
the
girl
they
call
snowbird
no
come
come
she
knows
you
very
well
ah
a
mystery
he
is
concealing
something
cried
miss
wayland
marsh
directed
a
sharp
glance
at
boyd
before
answering
i
presume
you
refer
to
constantine
sister
i
was
speaking
generally
of
course
there
are
exceptions
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
exactly
right
when
i
said
we
had
no
white
women
whatever
at
kalvik
emerson
doubtless
has
met
cherry
malotte
i
have
acknowledged
boyd
she
was
very
kind
to
us
more
damning
disclosures
chuckled
wayland
pray
who
is
she
i
should
like
very
much
to
know
emerson
answered
oh
delightful
exclaimed
mildred
first
a
beautiful
indian
girl
now
a
mysterious
white
woman
why
kalvik
is
decidedly
interesting
there
is
nothing
mysterious
about
the
white
woman
said
marsh
she
is
quite
typical
just
a
plain
mining
camp
who
drifted
down
our
way
not
at
all
boyd
disclaimed
angrily
miss
malotte
is
a
fine
woman
then
at
marsh
short
laugh
and
her
conduct
bears
favorable
comparison
with
that
of
the
other
white
people
at
kalvik
marsh
allowed
his
eyes
to
waver
at
this
but
to
mildred
he
apologized
she
is
not
the
sort
one
cares
to
discuss
how
do
you
know
demanded
cherry
champion
do
you
know
anything
against
her
character
i
know
she
is
a
disturbing
element
at
kalviks
and
has
caused
us
a
great
deal
of
trouble
it
was
boyd
turn
to
laugh
but
surely
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
her
character
my
dear
fellow
marsh
shrugged
his
shoulders
apologetically
if
i
had
dreamed
she
was
a
friend
of
yours
i
never
would
have
spoken
she
is
a
friend
emerson
persisted
doggedly
and
i
admire
her
because
she
is
a
girl
of
spirit
if
she
had
not
been
possessed
of
enough
courage
to
disregard
your
instructions
i
might
have
been
forced
to
eject
your
watchman
and
take
possession
of
one
of
your
canneries
we
ca
entertain
all
comers
we
leave
that
to
miss
malotte
and
george
balt
eh
dear
dear
laughed
miss
wayland
i
feel
as
if
i
were
at
a
meeting
of
the
woman
guild
in
our
business
we
must
adhere
to
a
definite
policy
marsh
explained
to
the
others
sometimes
we
are
misjudged
by
travellers
who
consider
us
heartless
but
we
ca
take
care
of
every
one
not
even
your
sick
natives
well
but
for
miss
malotte
some
of
your
fishermen
would
have
starved
this
winter
and
you
might
have
been
next
year
we
give
them
work
why
should
we
support
them
i
do
know
of
any
legal
reason
and
ethics
do
count
for
much
up
there
nevertheless
cherry
malotte
has
seen
to
it
that
the
children
at
least
have
suffered
she
saved
a
little
brother
of
this
constantine
you
mention
constantine
has
no
brother
marsh
answered
i
happen
to
know
because
he
worked
for
me
this
was
a
little
youngster
ah
marsh
ejaculation
was
sharp
what
was
the
matter
with
it
measles
did
it
get
well
it
was
getting
along
all
right
when
i
left
the
other
fell
silent
while
miss
wayland
inquired
curiously
what
is
this
mysterious
woman
like
she
is
young
refined
thoroughly
nice
in
every
way
also
i
dare
say
very
she
was
about
to
pursue
her
inquiries
further
but
the
dinner
was
finished
and
wayland
had
asked
for
his
favorite
cigars
so
she
rose
and
boyd
accompanied
her
leaving
the
others
to
smoke
but
strangely
enough
marsh
remained
in
such
a
state
of
preoccupation
even
after
their
departure
that
wayland
attempts
at
conversation
elicited
only
the
vaguest
and
shortest
of
answers
in
the
mildred
turned
upon
boyd
why
did
you
tell
me
about
this
woman
before
i
did
think
of
her
and
yet
she
is
young
beautiful
refined
lives
a
romantic
sort
of
existence
and
entertained
you
she
tossed
her
head
are
you
jealous
he
inquired
with
a
smile
of
such
a
person
certainly
not
i
wish
you
were
he
confessed
truthfully
if
you
would
only
get
really
jealous
i
should
be
delighted
i
should
begin
to
feel
a
little
sure
of
you
she
seated
herself
at
the
piano
and
struck
a
few
idle
notes
inquiring
casually
kalvik
is
the
name
of
the
place
where
you
are
going
it
it
is
i
suppose
you
will
see
a
great
deal
of
this
cherry
malotte
undoubtedly
inasmuch
as
we
are
partners
partners
mildred
ceased
playing
and
swung
about
what
do
you
mean
she
is
interested
in
this
enterprise
the
cannery
site
is
hers
i
see
after
a
moment
does
this
new
affair
of
father
have
any
particular
effect
on
your
plans
yes
and
no
he
answered
feeling
again
the
weight
of
this
last
complication
forgotten
for
the
moment
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
nothing
only
for
the
present
please
do
mention
my
scheme
either
to
him
or
to
marsh
i
am
a
bit
uncertain
as
to
my
course
you
see
it
means
so
much
to
me
that
i
ca
bear
to
give
it
up
and
yet
it
may
lead
to
great
unpleasantness
she
nodded
comprehendingly
the
others
joined
them
and
boyd
made
his
adieus
but
in
leaving
he
bore
with
him
a
weight
of
doubt
and
uneasiness
in
strange
contrast
with
the
buoyancy
he
had
felt
upon
his
arrival
willis
marsh
on
the
contrary
lost
no
time
in
emerging
from
his
taciturn
mood
upon
boyd
departure
and
seemed
filled
with
even
more
than
his
accustomed
optimism
whatever
had
been
the
cause
of
his
transitory
depression
he
could
not
fail
to
reflect
that
his
fortunes
had
been
singularly
fair
of
late
and
now
that
the
other
man
was
out
of
the
way
miss
wayland
for
the
first
time
in
his
acquaintance
began
to
display
a
lively
interest
in
his
affairs
which
made
his
satisfaction
complete
she
questioned
him
closely
regarding
his
work
and
habits
in
the
north
letting
down
her
reserve
to
such
an
unparalleled
extent
that
when
wayland
at
last
excused
himself
and
retired
to
the
library
marsh
felt
that
the
psychological
moment
had
arrived
illustration
mildred
ceased
playing
and
swung
about
what
do
you
mean
this
has
been
a
day
of
triumphs
for
me
he
stated
and
i
am
anxious
to
crown
it
with
even
a
greater
do
be
greedy
the
girl
cautioned
that
is
man
nature
she
laughed
lightly
having
used
my
poor
yielding
parent
for
your
own
needs
you
now
wish
to
employ
his
innocent
child
in
the
same
manner
is
there
no
limit
to
your
ambition
there
is
and
i
can
reach
it
with
your
help
please
do
count
on
me
i
am
the
most
disappointing
of
creatures
but
he
disregarded
her
words
i
hope
not
at
any
rate
i
must
know
i
warn
you
she
said
nevertheless
i
insist
and
yet
i
do
quite
know
how
to
begin
it
is
a
new
story
to
you
perhaps
what
i
am
trying
to
say
but
it
is
to
me
i
can
assure
you
and
it
means
everything
to
me
i
do
even
have
to
tell
you
what
it
is
you
must
have
seen
it
in
my
eyes
i
i
have
never
cared
much
for
women
i
am
a
man
man
but
please
do
she
interrupted
quietly
but
he
continued
unheeding
you
must
know
that
i
love
you
every
man
must
love
you
but
no
man
could
love
you
more
than
i
do
i
i
could
make
a
lot
of
romantic
avowals
miss
mildred
but
i
am
not
an
adept
at
such
things
you
can
make
me
very
happy
if
i
am
sorry
i
know
what
i
have
said
is
trite
but
my
whole
heart
is
in
it
your
father
approves
i
am
quite
sure
and
so
it
all
rests
with
you
for
the
first
time
the
girl
realized
the
deadly
earnestness
of
the
man
and
felt
the
unusual
force
of
his
personality
which
made
it
seem
no
light
matter
to
refuse
him
he
took
his
disappointment
quietly
however
and
raised
himself
immensely
in
her
estimation
by
his
graceful
acceptance
of
the
inevitable
it
is
pretty
hard
on
a
fellow
he
smiled
but
please
do
let
it
make
any
difference
in
our
relations
i
hope
to
remain
a
welcome
visitor
and
to
see
as
much
of
you
as
before
more
if
you
wish
i
begin
to
understand
that
emerson
is
a
lucky
chap
he
still
smiled
she
ignored
his
meaning
and
replied
boyd
and
i
have
been
the
closest
of
friends
for
many
years
so
i
have
been
told
and
he
smiled
at
her
again
in
the
same
manner
somehow
the
smile
annoyed
her
it
seemed
to
savor
of
when
he
bade
her
an
hour
later
he
was
still
smiling
wayland
was
busy
over
some
rare
first
edition
recently
received
from
his
english
collector
when
she
sought
him
out
in
the
library
he
looked
up
to
inquire
has
willis
gone
yes
he
sent
you
his
adieus
by
me
a
moment
later
she
added
he
asked
me
to
marry
him
of
course
nodded
the
magnate
they
all
do
that
what
did
you
say
what
i
always
say
h
he
tapped
his
eyeglasses
meditatively
upon
the
bridge
of
his
nose
you
might
do
worse
he
suits
me
i
have
no
doubt
he
could
hold
the
millions
together
in
fact
he
is
the
first
one
i
have
seen
of
whose
ability
in
that
line
i
am
quite
certain
however
she
made
a
slight
gesture
of
dismissal
i
hope
you
did
offend
him
she
raised
her
brows
forgive
me
i
might
have
known
he
stared
at
the
page
before
him
for
a
moment
you
have
a
certain
finality
about
you
that
is
almost
masculine
they
never
return
to
the
charge
oh
yes
she
demurred
there
is
alton
clyde
for
instance
wayland
dismissed
clyde
with
an
inarticulate
grunt
of
contempt
which
measured
that
young
man
claim
to
consideration
more
comprehensively
than
could
a
wealth
of
words
i
would
think
it
over
if
i
were
you
he
advised
then
he
pondered
if
you
would
only
change
your
mind
occasionally
like
other
girls
i
have
changed
my
mind
since
marsh
left
good
he
declared
heartily
yes
i
have
decided
to
go
to
kalvik
with
you
on
that
very
night
in
a
little
cabin
crouching
close
against
the
kalvik
bluffs
another
girl
was
seated
at
a
piano
her
slim
white
fingers
had
strayed
upon
the
notes
of
a
song
which
boyd
emerson
had
sung
in
her
eyes
was
the
picture
of
a
silent
man
at
her
shoulder
and
in
her
ears
was
the
sound
of
his
voice
clear
to
the
last
melting
note
she
played
the
air
and
then
a
pitiful
sob
shook
her
she
bowed
her
golden
head
and
hid
her
face
in
her
arms
for
a
memory
was
upon

a
forgotten
kiss
was
hot
upon
her
lips
and
she
was
very
lonely
chapter
xiii
in
which
cherry
malotte
becomes
suspicious
at
the
hotel
emerson
found
clyde
and
fraser
in
balt
room
awaiting
him
they
were
noisy
and
excited
at
the
success
of
the
enterprise
and
at
the
prospect
of
immediate
action
quoth
fingerless
fraser
it
has
certainly
lifted
a
load
off
my
mind
to
put
this
deal
through
emerson
was
forced
to
smile
now
that
you
have
succeeded
said
he
what
next
back
to
the
coast
this
town
is
a
bum
are
you
going
west
with
us
sure
why
not
this
game
ai
opened
yet
how
long
are
we
to
be
favored
with
your
assistance
hard
telling
i
want
to
see
you
get
off
on
the
right
foot
i
feel
bad
if
you
fell
down
well
of
all
let
him
rave
advised
george
he
ca
sell
us
nothing
i
did
share
anyhow
alton
clyde
declared
curling
up
comfortably
in
his
chair
with
a
smile
of
such
beatitude
that
fraser
cried
now
purr
nice
kitty
seems
like
i
can
see
a
canary
feather
sticking
to
your
mustache
it
is
my
debut
in
business
clyde
explained
it
my
commercial
party
i
never
did
anything
useful
before
in
my
whole
life
so
naturally
i
all
swelled
up
it
ai
necessary
for
me
to
itemize
statement
fraser
observed
a
moment
consecutive
thought
will
show
anybody
who
capable
of
bearing
the
strain
of
that
much
brain
effort
where
i
came
in
gazing
upon
them
with
prophetic
eye
he
announced
and
mark
what
i
say
gents
i
be
even
a
bigger
help
to
you
before
you
get
through
you
do
the
rough
work
i
be
there
with
the
bottle
of
oil
and
the
yes
sir
when
the
time
comes
i
go
down
in
the
little
bag
of
tricks
and
dig
up
anything
you
need
from
a
jig
dance
to
a
jimmy
and
a
bottle
of
soup
i
know
what
you
call
exclaimed
alton
with
lively
interest
did
you
ever
crack
a
safe
by
jove
that
immense
i
worked
in
banks
considerable
fingerless
fraser
admitted
with
admirable
caution
what
i
mean
to
say
is
i
a
general
handy
man
and
i
may
be
useful
so
you
better
let
me
stick
around
boyd
told
them
little
of
the
news
that
had
startled
him
earlier
in
the
evening
beyond
the
bare
fact
that
marsh
had
floated
a
packers
trust
and
that
secrecy
for
the
present
was
now
doubly
necessary
to
the
success
of
their
undertaking
the
full
significance
of
the
merger
therefore
did
not
strike
his
associates
even
when
on
the
train
the
next
day
they
read
the
announcement
of
its
formation
in
the
newspapers
balt
alone
took
notice
of
it
and
fell
into
a
furious
rage
at
his
enemy
success
alton
clyde
on
the
other
hand
was
more
than
ever
elated
over
his
share
in
a
conspiracy
threatened
by
so
formidable
a
foe
and
when
emerson
constituted
him
a
sort
of
secretary
with
duties
mainly
of
sending
and
receiving
telegrams
his
delight
was
beyond
measure
he
grew
in
fact
insufferably
conceited
and
his
overweening
sense
of
his
own
importance
became
a
severe
trial
to
fraser
who
was
roused
to
his
most
elaborate
efforts
of
sarcasm
the
adventurer
wasted
hours
in
a
search
for
fitting
similes
by
which
to
measure
the
clubman
general
and
comprehensive
ineptitude
all
of
which
rebounded
from
his
armor
of
complacency
no
sooner
were
they
fairly
under
way
for
the
west
than
emerson
began
the
definite
shaping
of
his
plans
he
and
george
carefully
went
over
the
many
details
of
their
coming
work
and
sent
many
messages
with
the
result
that
outfitters
in
a
dozen
lines
were
awaiting
them
when
they
arrived
in
seattle
without
loss
of
time
boyd
installed
himself
and
his
friends
at
a
hotel
secured
a
competent
and
stenographer
and
then
sought
out
the
banker
with
whom
he
had
made
a
tentative
agreement
before
going
to
chicago
hilliard
greeted
him
cordially
i
see
you
have
carried
out
your
part
of
the
programme
said
he
but
before
we
definitely
commit
ourselves
we
should
like
to
know
what
effect
this
new
trust
is
going
to
have
on
the
canning
business
you
mean
the
p
precisely
our
chicago
correspondent
ca
tell
us
any
more
than
we
have
learned
from
the
press
namely
that
a
combination
has
been
formed
we
are
naturally
somewhat
cautious
about
financing
a
competitive
plant
until
we
know
what
policy
the
trust
will
pursue
here
was
exactly
the
complication
boyd
had
feared
therefore
it
was
with
some
trepidation
that
he
argued
the
trust
is
in
business
for
the
money
and
its
very
formation
ought
to
be
conclusive
evidence
of
your
good
judgment
however
you
have
backed
so
many
plants
such
as
mine
that
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
the
big
profits
to
be
taken
that
is
the
point
ordinarily
we
would
not
waver
an
instant
but
the
outfit
is
apt
to
upset
conditions
if
we
only
knew
i
know
boldly
declared
boyd
wayland
outlined
his
policy
to
me
before
the
public
knew
anything
about
the
trust
indeed
are
you
acquainted
with
wayne
wayland
asked
hilliard
with
a
new
light
of
curiosity
in
his
eyes
i
know
him
well
ah
i
congratulate
you
perhaps
this
is
er
wayland
money
behind
you
that
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
discuss
the
younger
man
replied
evasively
however
just
to
make
your
loan
absolutely
sure
i
have
taken
steps
to
sell
my
season
output
in
advance
the
commission
men
will
be
in
town
shortly
and
i
shall
contract
for
the
entire
catch
at
a
stipulated
price
is
that
satisfactory
entirely
so
declared
hilliard
heartily
go
ahead
and
order
your
machinery
and
supplies
as
boyd
rose
to
go
he
added
by
the
way
what
do
you
know
about
the
mineral
possibilities
of
the
region
back
of
kalvik
not
much
the
country
is
new
there
is
a
woman
at
kalvik
who
has
some
men
out
prospecting
cherry
malotte
do
you
know
her
asked
boyd
with
astonishment
very
well
indeed
i
have
had
some
correspondence
with
her
quite
recently
then
noting
boyd
evident
curiosity
he
went
on
you
see
i
have
made
a
number
of
mining
investments
in
the
north
entirely
on
my
own
account
he
hastened
to
explain
of
course
the
bank
could
not
do
such
a
thing
my
operations
have
turned
out
so
well
that
i
keep
several
men
just
to
follow
new
strikes
has
miss
malotte
made
a
strike
not
exactly
but
she
has
uncovered
some
promising
copper
prospects
h
that
is
news
to
me
it
is
rather
a
small
country
after
all
is
it
he
would
have
liked
to
ask
the
banker
certain
further
questions
but
resisted
the
temptation
and
shortly
after
plunged
into
his
work
so
vigorously
that
the
subject
faded
wholly
from
his
mind
now
it
was
that
george
balt
made
his
importance
felt
in
the
days
which
followed
he
and
boyd
toiled
early
and
late
for
a
thousand
things
needed
doing
at
once
promptness
was
above
all
things
the
essence
of
this
enterprise
and
the
lumber
merchants
coal
dealers
machinery
salesmen
and
ship
chandlers
with
whom
they
dealt
vowed
they
never
had
met
men
who
reached
their
decisions
so
quickly
and
labored
not
only
with
such
consuming
haste
but
with
such
unerring
certainty
there
was
no
haggling
over
prices
no
loss
of
time
in
seeking
competitive
bids
and
because
george
always
knew
precisely
what
he
wanted
their
task
of
selection
became
comparatively
easy
with
every
detail
of
the
business
he
was
familiar
from
long
experience
there
was
no
piece
of
machinery
that
he
did
not
know
better
than
its
makers
there
was
never
any
hesitancy
as
between
rival
types
or
loading
down
with
superfluous
gear
his
main
concern
was
for
dates
of
delivery
three
weeks
passed
quickly
in
strenuous
effort
and
then
one
morning
the
partners
awoke
to
the
realization
that
there
was
little
more
for
them
to
do
orders
were
in
shipments
had
started
they
had
completed
the
charter
of
a
ship
and
a
sailing
date
had
been
set
there
were
numerous
details
yet
to
be
arranged
but
the
enterprise
was
in
motion
and
what
remained
was
simple
despite
their
desperate
hurry
they
had
made
no
mistakes
and
for
this
the
credit
lay
largely
with
big
george
through
it
all
clyde
had
lent
them
enthusiastic
if
feeble
assistance
and
now
that
the
strain
was
off
he
gave
fitting
expression
to
his
delight
by
getting
drunk
being
temperamental
to
a
degree
he
craved
company
and
knowing
full
well
the
opposition
he
would
encounter
from
his
friends
he
annexed
a
bibulous
following
of
loafers
whose
time
hung
heavy
and
who
were
at
all
times
eager
to
applaud
a
loose
tongue
so
long
as
it
was
accompanied
by
a
loose
purse
toward
midnight
fingerless
fraser
cruising
in
a
nocturnal
search
for
adventure
and
profit
found
him
in
a
state
descanting
vaporously
to
his
train
and
upon
catching
mention
of
the
kalvik
fisheries
snatched
him
homeward
and
put
him
to
bed
after
which
he
locked
him
into
his
room
threw
the
key
over
the
transom
and
stood
guard
outside
until
assured
that
he
slept
at
an
early
hour
the
adventurer
was
peremptorily
roused
to
find
emerson
hammering
at
his
door
in
a
fine
fury
what
is
this
demanded
boyd
through
white
lips
thrusting
a
morning
paper
before
fraser
sleepy
eyes
it
a
newspaper
yawned
the
other
a
regular
newspaper
where
did
this
story
come
from
with
menacing
finger
boyd
indicated
a
front
column
headed
new
enemy
of
the
salmon
trust
first
gun
fired
in
battle
for
fisheries
a
promised
bitter
fight
for
supremacy
of
alaskan
waters
i
do
know
you
do
know
no
i
never
read
anything
but
the
performances
and
the
funny
page
what
does
it
say
it
is
the
whole
story
of
our
enterprise
but
ridiculously
garbled
and
exaggerated
it
says
i
have
headed
a
new
canning
company
to
buck
the
trust
it
tells
about
george
feud
with
marsh
and
says
we
have
both
been
secretly
preparing
to
down
him
good
lord
it
liable
to
queer
us
with
the
bank
and
upset
the
whole
deal
i
did
give
it
out
it
is
all
done
in
your
particularly
picturesque
style
declared
emerson
angrily
alton
swears
he
knows
nothing
about
it
so
you
must
have
done
it
it
is
too
nearly
correct
to
have
come
from
a
stranger
well
inquired
fraser
quietly
the
harm
is
done
but
i
want
to
know
who
is
to
blame
when
the
other
made
no
answer
except
to
stare
at
him
curiously
he
flamed
up
why
do
you
confess
for
the
first
time
during
their
acquaintance
fingerless
fraser
seemed
at
a
loss
for
words
but
whether
for
shame
or
some
other
motive
his
companion
was
unable
to
tell
his
nature
was
so
warped
that
his
emotions
expressed
themselves
in
ways
not
always
easy
to
follow
and
now
he
merely
remarked
with
apparent
sullenness
i
certainly
a
hot
favorite
with
you
he
clambered
stiffly
back
into
bed
and
turned
his
defiant
face
to
the
wall
nor
would
he
meet
his
accuser
eyes
or
open
his
lips
even
when
boyd
flung
out
of
the
room
convinced
that
he
was
the
culprit
all
that
day
emerson
waited
fearfully
for
some
word
from
hilliard
but
night
came
without
it
and
when
several
days
in
succession
had
passed
without
a
sign
from
the
banker
he
breathed
more
easily
he
had
already
begun
to
assure
himself
that
after
all
the
exposure
would
have
no
effect
when
one
evening
the
call
he
dreaded
came
a
telephone
message
summoned
him
to
the
bank
at
eleven
the
following
morning
that
means
trouble
he
grimly
told
george
maybe
not
the
big
fisherman
replied
if
hilliard
took
any
stock
in
the
story
it
seems
like
he
have
jumped
you
the
next
day
our
machinery
is
ordered
you
realize
what
it
will
mean
if
he
backs
water
now
sure
we
have
to
go
to
some
other
bank
humph
i
wring
fraser
neck
muttered
emerson
we
have
troubles
enough
without
any
new
ones
it
was
with
no
little
anxiety
that
he
asked
for
the
banker
at
the
appointed
hour
and
was
shown
into
an
anteroom
with
the
announcement
hilliard
is
busy
he
wishes
you
to
wait
inside
the
glass
partition
boyd
heard
a
woman
voice
and
laughter
he
took
some
comfort
in
the
thought
that
the
banker
was
in
a
at
least
but
being
too
nervous
to
sit
still
he
stood
at
the
window
gazing
with
vacant
eyes
at
the
busy
street
crowds
facing
him
across
the
way
was
a
in
front
of
a
newspaper
office
and
after
a
time
he
noted
idly
among
its
various
items
of
information
the
announcement
that
the
mail
steamer
had
arrived
at
midnight
from
skagway
he
wondered
why
cherry
had
not
written
surely
she
must
be
anxious
to
know
his
progress
he
should
have
advised
her
of
his
whereabouts
the
door
to
hilliard
office
opened
and
he
heard
the
rustle
of
a
woman
dress
then
his
own
name
spoken
come
in
mr
emerson
his
attention
centred
on
the
approaching
interview
he
did
not
glance
toward
the
departing
visitor
until
she
stopped
suddenly
at
the
outer
door
and
came
straight
toward
him
with
outstretched
hands
boyd
he
checked
himself
and
turned
to
face
cherry
malotte
why
cherry
he
ejaculated
what
in
the
world
he
took
her
two
hands
in
his
and
she
laughed
up
into
his
face
in
the
name
of
heaven
where
did
you
come
from
i
arrived
last
night
on
the
she
said
oh
i
glad
to
see
you
but
what
brings
you
to
the
states
i
thought
you
were
in
kal
she
laid
a
finger
on
her
lips
with
a
glance
over
her
shoulder
at
the
door
to
the
inner
office
i
tell
you
about
it
later
hilliard
will
see
you
now
sir
the
attendant
announced
to
emerson
i
must
talk
to
you
right
away
boyd
exclaimed
hurriedly
i
wo
be
long
can
you
wait
certainly
i
wait
right
here
only
hurry
hurry
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
was
so
genuine
that
he
squeezed
her
hands
heartily
and
entered
hilliard
sanctum
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
it
was
gone
however
when
he
reappeared
a
later
and
in
its
place
an
expression
which
caused
her
to
inquire
quickly
what
is
the
matter
is
something
wrong
he
nodded
but
it
was
not
until
they
had
reached
the
outer
office
that
he
said
yes
something
is
decidedly
wrong
then
in
answer
to
her
further
question
wait
a
while
i
too
angry
to
talk
i
have
to
tell
you
all
about
it
before
you
understand
he
began
to
mutter
harshly
under
his
breath
come
along
we
have
lunch
and
explain
first
however
tell
me
why
you
came
out
at
this
season
i
have
a
big
mining
deal
on
with
hilliard
he
sent
for
me
and
i
came
oh
i
hardly
know
where
to
begin
but
you
remember
when
you
were
in
kalvik
i
told
you
that
i
had
several
men
out
prospecting
yes
well
last
summer
long
before
you
came
through
one
of
them
located
a
ledge
of
copper
you
never
told
me
there
was
anything
to
tell
at
that
time
i
had
received
any
assay
reports
and
i
did
know
whether
the
thing
was
worth
telling
but
shortly
after
you
left
the
returns
came
in
and
they
showed
remarkable
values
now
here
is
the
wonderful
part
of
the
story
unknown
to
me
my
man
had
sent
out
other
samples
and
a
letter
to
a
friend
of
his
here
in
seattle
that
man
had
assays
made
on
his
own
account
and
came
to
hilliard
with
the
result
the
very
next
boat
brought
him
and
hilliard
expert
to
katmai
they
came
over
with
the
we
had
opened
up
the
ore
body
somewhat
in
the
mean
time
and
it
take
those
men
long
to
see
what
we
had
they
were
back
at
my
place
in
no
time
with
a
proposition
when
i
refused
to
tie
up
the
ground
they
made
me
come
out
with
them
foxy
halliard
had
foreseen
what
would
happen
and
instructed
them
to
bring
me
to
him
if
they
had
to
kidnap
me
well
i
was
a
willing
victim
and
here
i
am
prepared
to
deal
with
banker
provided
we
can
reach
an
agreement
what
do
you
think
of
me
as
a
business
woman
boyd
smiled
at
her
enthusiasm
i
think
you
are
fine
in
every
way
and
i
hope
you
take
all
of
his
money
away
from
him
i
ca
get
any
it
will
take
a
lot
of
capital
and
time
to
develop
the
mine
and
i
am
fighting
now
for
control
he
is
a
old
fellow
i
should
say
he
is
remarked
emerson
he
has
just
thrown
a
bomb
into
our
camp
that
makes
my
teeth
rattle
he
promised
to
back
me
for
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
this
morning
went
back
on
his
word
and
lay
down
absolutely
begin
at
the
beginning
and
tell
me
everything
commanded
the
girl
i
dying
to
know
what
you
have
been
doing
now
right
from
the
start
mind
you
they
had
reached
emerson
hotel
and
escorting
her
to
the
he
proceeded
to
trace
his
progress
from
the
day
he
had
bade
her
farewell
in
the
snows
of
kalvik
they
had
finished
their
meal
before
his
narrative
came
to
a
close
hilliard
called
me
in
and
coolly
informed
me
that
his
bank
could
not
make
the
loan
he
had
promised
me
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
i
had
relied
on
his
assurances
and
ordered
my
supplies
which
are
now
being
shipped
did
he
offer
any
reason
for
his
withdrawal
oh
i
dare
say
he
gave
a
reason
but
he
beclouded
it
with
so
many
words
that
it
was
merely
a
fog
by
the
time
he
got
through
all
i
could
distinguish
in
the
general
obscurity
was
that
he
would
not
produce
he
said
something
about
the
bank
being
overloaded
and
the
board
refusing
its
consent
it
remarkable
what
a
barricade
a
banker
can
build
out
of
one
board
and
yet
as
i
understand
it
you
have
sold
your
output
in
advance
at
a
fixed
price
correct
it
is
very
strange
the
bank
would
be
perfectly
safe
he
merely
bulkheaded
himself
in
with
a
lot
of
smooth
language
and
when
i
tried
to
argue
myself
over
i
just
slid
off
the
moment
i
stepped
into
his
office
i
felt
the
temperature
drop
something
new
has
come
up
what
it
is
i
do
know
anyhow
he
froze
me
out
we
must
raise
that
money
somewhere
or
we
are
ruined
cherry
observed
with
decision
well
rather
boyd
agreed
with
a
desperate
grimace
the
girl
laughed
hilliard
and
i
merely
tried
each
other
mettle
this
morning
i
am
to
return
at
four
let
meet
later
and
dress
each
other
wounds
he
suggested
cherry
presence
had
heartened
him
wonderfully
and
the
sight
of
her
brightly
animated
face
across
the
table
inspired
him
with
a
kind
of
joyous
courage
the
like
of
which
he
had
scarcely
felt
since
their
former
meeting
in
her
company
his
worries
had
almost
disappeared
laughter
had
become
a
living
thing
and
youth
a
blessing
i
agree
to
anything
she
answered
then
becoming
suddenly
earnest
she
spoke
with
shining
eyes
hilliard
is
going
to
open
up
this
copper
and
it
is
going
to
make
me
rich
rich
i
ca
tell
you
what
that
means
to
me
you
would
understand
i
can
leave
that
whole
north
country
behind
me
and
all
that
it
signifies
i
can
be
what
i
want
to
be
what
i
really
am
boyd
saw
the
great
yearning
in
her
eyes
saw
that
she
was
fairly
breathless
with
the
intensity
of
her
hope
he
reached
forth
and
taking
her
tightly
clasped
hands
in
his
said
simply
if
i
can
help
you
in
any
way
it
will
be
my
greatest
pleasure
her
glance
dropped
before
his
straight
gaze
and
she
answered
you
are
a
good
man
i
am
glad
to
have
you
for
a
friend
but
you
will
pardon
my
selfishness
wo
you
i
did
mean
to
put
forward
my
own
affairs
when
yours
are
going
so
badly
they
went
very
well
he
declared
until
i
tried
to
climb
this
glacier
did
that
newspaper
story
frighten
mr
hilliard
i
could
make
out
whether
it
did
or
not
let
see
it
was
nearly
a
week
ago
that
it
appeared
five
days
to
be
exact
it
takes
three
days
to
come
from
chicago
does
it
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
has
it
struck
you
as
strange
that
hilliard
should
wait
until
you
had
sewed
yourself
up
in
a
web
of
contracts
and
obligations
before
advising
you
of
the
bad
news
if
you
mean
that
this
is
the
doing
of
that
chicago
outfit
why
did
they
wait
so
long
if
the
associated
press
sent
that
item
to
chicago
or
if
they
were
advised
from
here
why
did
they
wire
back
it
all
could
have
been
effected
by
telegraph
in
no
time
it
would
be
possible
to
do
such
a
thing
by
wire
or
by
mail
and
besides
willis
marsh
does
work
that
way
if
that
despatch
was
printed
in
chicago
and
if
he
saw
it
i
predict
trouble
for
you
in
raising
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
seattle
you
are
not
a
bit
reassuring
however
i
shall
soon
determine
he
arose
i
call
for
you
at
seven
and
i
wager
right
now
that
your
fears
are
groundless
prepare
to
see
me
return
with
a
ring
through
the
nose
of
our
giant
at
seven
sharp
she
agreed
meanwhile
i
shall
delight
myself
with
a
shopping
expedition
i
a
perfect
sight
at
seven
she
descended
from
her
room
in
answer
to
his
call
to
find
him
pacing
the
hotel
parlor
his
jaw
set
stubbornly
what
luck
she
demanded
you
spoke
with
the
tongue
of
a
prophet
money
has
suddenly
become
very
scarce
in
seattle
how
many
banks
did
you
try
three
i
shall
try
the
rest
how
did
you
fare
first
blood
is
mine
i
feel
that
i
shall
capture
hilliard
now
no
more
business
do
you
understand
no
you
are
not
to
mention
the
subject
again
you
need
a
rest
do
you
know
that
your
face
is
haggard
and
drawn
you
are
tired
out
after
a
moment
pause
he
acknowledged
i
believe
i
am
i
i
am
very
glad
you
have
come
cherry
chapter
xiv
in
which
they
recognize
the
enemy
boyd
emerson
slept
well
that
night
notwithstanding
the
disturbing
occurrences
of
the
day
for
during
the
evening
cherry
had
tactfully
diverted
him
from
all
mention
of
business
trusts
or
canneries
much
as
a
good
physical
director
on
the
eve
of
a
contest
relieves
the
grinding
monotony
of
an
athlete
training
the
brain
after
all
is
but
flesh
and
blood
and
like
the
muscles
requires
rest
an
unbroken
intensity
of
contemplation
tends
inevitably
to
weariness
and
pessimism
they
had
dined
gayly
while
care
fled
before
the
exuberant
spirits
contentment
had
deepened
in
the
companionable
enjoyment
of
a
play
and
later
a
little
at
which
big
george
and
alton
clyde
were
present
had
completed
boyd
mental
refreshment
to
cherry
satisfaction
true
it
had
required
all
her
skill
to
prevent
the
big
fisherman
from
holding
forth
upon
the
issue
uppermost
in
his
mind
but
his
loyalty
to
her
was
doglike
and
once
he
found
that
his
pet
topic
was
tabooed
he
lapsed
into
a
contemplation
of
his
which
he
polished
industriously
with
his
napkin
the
girl
had
further
demonstrated
her
power
over
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
by
reducing
the
blase
young
to
a
state
of
grinning
admiration
fingerless
fraser
alone
had
been
missing
from
the
coterie
he
had
discovered
them
from
a
distance
to
be
sure
and
come
over
to
exchange
greetings
with
cherry
but
the
disastrous
result
of
the
fellow
garrulity
was
still
so
fresh
in
boyd
mind
that
he
could
not
invite
him
to
join
them
and
fraser
with
singular
modesty
had
quickly
withdrawn
to
wander
lonesomely
for
a
while
till
sheer
ennui
drove
him
to
bed
his
dejection
awakened
little
sympathy
in
boyd
who
felt
happier
for
the
removal
of
his
irritating
presence
in
the
morning
boyd
was
brought
sharply
back
to
a
realization
of
his
difficult
position
by
a
letter
from
mildred
wayland
father
and
i
had
another
scene
over
you
wrote
mildred
it
was
the
first
quarrel
we
ever
had
and
i
half
sick
as
a
result
i
simply
ca
bear
that
sort
of
thing
and
we
have
agreed
to
drop
the
subject
what
roused
him
to
such
a
sudden
fury
i
sure
i
do
know
boyd
knew
however
and
the
knowledge
did
not
add
to
his
comfort
it
seemed
indeed
as
if
the
trust
enmity
had
marked
him
in
the
eyes
of
the
whole
financial
world
he
was
again
denied
assistance
at
the
banks
and
this
time
in
a
manner
to
show
him
the
futility
of
argument
or
further
effort
the
reasons
given
were
as
final
as
they
were
vague
and
night
found
the
young
promoter
half
dazed
and
desperately
frightened
at
the
completeness
of
the
disaster
which
had
overwhelmed
him
in
the
brief
space
of
hours
he
could
not
blind
himself
to
the
situation
those
chicago
men
who
had
backed
him
were
personal
friends
and
they
had
risked
their
dollars
purely
upon
the
strength
of
his
vivid
assurances
he
had
prevailed
upon
them
to
invest
more
than
they
could
afford
and
while
ultimate
failure
might
be
forgiven
it
savored
less
of
indiscretion
than
of
criminal
culpability
to
be
left
at
the
very
outset
of
the
enterprise
with
a
shipload
of
useless
machinery
upon
the
docks
at
seattle
ruin
was
close
upon
him
in
his
perplexity
he
turned
naturally
to
cherry
who
listened
to
his
tale
of
repeated
failure
with
furrowed
brows
pondering
the
matter
as
seriously
as
if
the
responsibility
had
been
her
own
the
battle
has
begun
sooner
than
i
expected
she
said
at
length
i
never
dreamed
they
could
fix
the
banks
so
quickly
somehow
i
ca
believe
this
is
the
work
of
the
trust
people
i
see
how
they
could
accomplish
so
much
in
so
short
a
time
why
it
came
like
a
thunderclap
i
hope
i
am
wrong
she
answered
but
something
unexpected
must
have
happened
to
change
hilliard
attitude
what
could
it
be
except
pressure
from
higher
sources
has
he
dropped
any
hint
before
you
not
a
hint
he
would
let
go
of
anything
why
he
is
too
to
drop
his
r
so
i
am
told
he
belongs
to
that
anomalous
class
who
are
as
rigid
in
business
methods
as
they
are
loose
in
private
morals
indeed
cherry
seemed
curious
but
inasmuch
as
his
extravagance
begins
at
and
ends
at
it
does
seem
to
affect
his
social
standing
however
we
need
discuss
his
personal
character
there
enough
to
think
of
without
that
will
you
take
dinner
with
me
this
evening
so
that
we
can
talk
over
any
further
developments
i
am
to
dine
with
hilliard
said
the
girl
oh
boyd
tone
of
disappointment
seemed
disproportionate
to
the
occasion
he
endeavored
to
disguise
his
feeling
by
saying
lightly
you
are
breaking
into
exclusive
circles
he
lives
in
quite
a
palace
i
told
i
i
not
dining
at
his
home
cherry
hesitated
and
boyd
flashed
a
sharp
glance
at
her
a
faint
color
flushed
her
cheeks
as
she
explained
he
could
not
see
me
at
the
office
so
he
arranged
for
me
to
take
dinner
with
him
i
see
boyd
detected
a
note
hitherto
strange
in
his
own
voice
i
am
going
to
try
the
tacoma
banks
would
you
like
to
run
over
with
me
in
the
morning
the
sound
trip
is
beautiful
i
would
love
to
she
exclaimed
i
may
have
something
to
report
if
i
can
make
hilliard
talk
out
of
curiosity
i
should
like
to
know
what
influenced
him
all
women
were
more
or
less
suspicious
he
reflected
and
some
of
them
were
highly
intuitive
still
he
could
not
believe
that
this
was
all
willis
marsh
doing
as
he
mused
he
idly
thumbed
the
pages
of
a
magazine
he
was
about
to
lay
it
down
when
his
eye
caught
a
face
and
he
started
then
glanced
at
the
date
of
issue
it
was
a
duplicate
of
that
copy
which
had
affected
him
so
deeply
in
cherry
house
at
kalvik
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
find
her
scrutinizing
him
no
you
ca
cut
out
that
page
she
said
with
a
slightly
embarrassed
laugh
where
did
you
run
across
this
i
did
run
across
it
she
admitted
i
scoured
the
for
it
all
the
morning
curiosity
is
a
feminine
trait
you
know
i
do
quite
understand
that
missing
page
has
caused
me
insomnia
for
months
but
now
i
as
puzzled
as
ever
for
there
are
two
pictures
one
on
either
side
of
the
leaf
and
each
has
possibilities
which
is
it
the
society
bud
or
the
prima
donna
i
do
know
what
you
mean
he
answered
somewhat
stiffly
his
love
for
mildred
wayland
had
always
been
so
sacred
and
inviolable
a
thing
that
even
cherry
frank
inquisitiveness
seemed
an
intrusion
i
call
for
you
in
time
for
the
boat
he
added
as
he
arose
to
go
meanwhile
if
you
get
a
hint
from
hilliard
it
may
be
useful
left
to
his
own
devices
boyd
spent
the
evening
in
gloomy
solitude
vainly
seeking
for
some
way
out
of
his
difficulties
but
despite
his
preoccupation
with
his
own
affairs
a
vague
feeling
of
resentment
at
the
thought
of
cherry
and
hilliard
kept
forcing
itself
upon
his
mind
perhaps
the
girl
indiscretion
was
of
no
very
serious
nature
yet
he
found
it
hard
to
excuse
even
a
small
breach
of
propriety
upon
her
part
surely
she
must
understand
the
imprudence
of
dining
alone
with
the
banker
his
attentions
to
her
could
have
but
one
interpretation
and
she
was
too
nice
a
girl
to
compromise
herself
in
the
slightest
degree
although
he
told
himself
that
a
business
reason
had
prompted
her
and
reflected
that
the
business
methods
of
women
are
baffling
to
the
mind
of
mere
man
his
reasoning
quite
failed
to
reconcile
him
to
the
situation
in
the
end
he
had
to
acknowledge
that
he
did
not
like
the
look
of
it
in
the
least
but
in
the
morning
he
found
it
impossible
to
maintain
a
critical
attitude
in
cherry
presence
she
had
finished
her
breakfast
when
he
called
and
was
awaiting
him
clad
in
a
brown
velvet
suit
which
set
off
her
trim
figure
with
all
the
effectiveness
of
skilful
tailoring
brown
boots
and
gloves
to
match
with
a
dainty
turban
in
which
lay
the
golden
gleam
of
a
pheasant
plumage
completed
the
picture
she
was
as
perfect
to
the
eye
as
the
morning
itself
well
did
hilliard
expose
the
hidden
mysteries
of
the
banking
system
he
questioned
as
they
walked
down
toward
the
water
front
he
did
it
is
no
mystery
at
all
now
then
it
was
that
newspaper
story
that
frightened
him
indirectly
perhaps
he
did
mention
it
what
did
he
say
nothing
nothing
then
how
he
informed
me
that
you
are
in
love
with
the
society
girl
and
not
with
the
actress
he
said
you
are
engaged
to
marry
miss
wayland
yes
but
what
did
he
say
about
the
loan
only
what
i
have
told
you
the
rest
is
easy
had
you
been
less
secretive
i
would
have
known
instantly
whom
to
blame
for
this
trouble
wayne
wayland
and
willis
marsh
are
working
double
and
inasmuch
as
you
are
non
grata
who
told
you
i
am
non
grata
you
told
me
yourself
without
intending
to
please
give
me
credit
for
some
shrewdness
if
you
had
been
a
welcome
suitor
you
would
have
had
no
difficulty
in
raising
twice
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
chicago
then
too
i
remember
the
story
you
told
me
at
kalvik
your
mental
attitude
many
things
in
fact
oh
it
was
very
simple
well
what
of
it
what
has
all
that
got
to
do
with
my
present
difficulty
listen
you
want
to
marry
the
daughter
of
the
greatest
in
the
country
and
he
does
want
you
for
a
you
undertake
an
enterprise
which
seriously
threatens
his
financial
interests
and
if
successful
in
that
you
could
defy
his
opposition
in
the
other
matter
now
all
goes
well
until
he
learns
of
your
plans
then
he
strikes
with
his
own
weapons
a
word
here
and
there
a
hint
to
the
banks
and
your
fine
castle
comes
tumbling
down
about
your
ears
i
thought
you
had
more
perception
the
girl
voice
was
sharp
and
she
wore
that
expression
of
unyouthful
weariness
that
boyd
had
noted
before
he
could
not
help
wondering
what
bitter
experience
had
taught
her
disillusion
what
strange
environment
had
edged
her
wits
with
worldly
wisdom
we
have
figured
marsh
in
at
all
he
said
tentatively
he
figures
nevertheless
as
i
intend
to
show
you
to
begin
with
please
notice
that
unobtrusive
man
in
the
gray
suit
not
now
do
look
around
for
a
minute
you
will
see
him
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
boyd
turned
to
observe
a
fellow
across
the
way
evidently
bound
for
the
tacoma
boat
is
he
following
us
i
see
him
everywhere
i
go
boyd
face
clouded
angrily
at
which
cherry
exclaimed
now
for
heaven
sake
do
mimic
big
george
or
we
never
learn
anything
i
wo
stand
for
a
spy
he
growled
and
be
arrested
no
he
assured
her
grimly
it
may
be
as
you
suspect
but
you
need
fear
that
i
ever
go
to
jail
for
assaulting
one
of
willis
marsh
helpers
she
glanced
up
quickly
as
if
detecting
a
double
meaning
in
his
words
then
at
the
smouldering
fires
she
beheld
observed
in
a
gentler
tone
you
care
a
great
deal
for
miss
wayland
do
you
his
only
answer
was
a
deep
breath
and
a
slow
turning
of
the
head
but
once
she
had
seen
the
look
in
his
eyes
she
needed
no
other
she
could
only
say
i
hope
she
is
worthy
of
all
she
is
causing
you
to
suffer
boyd
so
few
of
us
are
she
did
not
speak
again
but
in
her
heart
was
a
great
heaviness
they
reached
the
dock
and
lost
sight
of
the
spy
only
to
have
him
reappear
soon
after
the
boat
cleared
and
while
neither
spoke
of
it
they
felt
his
presence
during
the
whole
trip
before
them
rainier
lifted
its
majestic
head
high
into
the
heavens
its
serrated
slopes
softened
by
a
purple
haze
its
soaring
crest
limned
in
blazing
glory
by
the
sun
the
bay
beneath
them
was
like
a
huge
silver
shield
and
glittering
inlaid
with
master
cunning
between
wooded
hills
that
swept
away
into
mysterious
distances
there
to
rise
skyward
in
an
confusion
it
reflected
islands
overgrown
till
they
bowed
to
their
mirrored
likenesses
now
a
smiling
inlet
opened
up
a
perspective
of
golden
sand
and
whispering
shingle
again
a
frowning
bluff
slipped
past
lost
in
lonely
contemplation
of
its
own
inverted
image
the
day
was
gorgeous
inspiring
their
course
lay
through
an
enchanted
region
so
suggestive
of
splendid
possibilities
that
boyd
was
constrained
to
observe
you
know
if
the
pilgrim
fathers
had
landed
here
in
the
first
place
new
england
would
never
have
been
discovered
a
remark
at
which
cherry
nodded
in
complete
agreement
at
tacoma
boyd
left
her
to
go
about
his
business
but
joined
her
later
at
lunch
with
the
joyful
announcement
i
had
better
luck
this
time
they
said
there
would
be
no
difficulty
whatever
in
handling
the
matter
and
they
are
to
let
me
know
definitely
did
hawkshaw
hound
you
to
the
bank
she
inquired
i
rather
think
so
then
will
tell
the
tale
you
mean
the
bank
will
turn
me
down
yes
if
i
sized
up
the
situation
correctly
i
dare
say
these
banks
are
as
cautious
as
those
in
seattle
and
a
few
words
over
the
telephone
would
do
the
trick
i
inclined
to
give
that
shadow
a
little
personal
attention
the
young
man
mused
but
when
she
questioned
him
he
only
smiled
and
assured
her
of
his
caution
again
on
the
return
trip
they
discovered
the
fellow
among
the
passengers
but
boyd
made
no
sign
until
the
boat
was
landing
then
cherry
found
that
he
had
edged
her
into
the
crowd
massed
at
the
gangway
and
caught
sight
of
the
man
in
gray
immediately
ahead
of
them
she
noticed
that
while
emerson
maintained
a
flow
of
conversation
his
eyes
were
constantly
upon
the
fellow
back
and
that
he
kept
a
position
close
to
his
shoulder
regardless
of
jostling
from
the
others
she
could
not
tell
what
this
foreboded
nor
did
she
gain
a
hint
of
boyd
purpose
until
the
was
in
place
and
they
were
out
upon
it
a
narrow
space
separated
the
boat
from
the
dock
as
they
crossed
this
boyd
slipped
and
half
fell
on
the
slanting
planks
she
never
knew
exactly
what
happened
except
that
he
released
her
arm
and
lunged
violently
against
the
man
in
gray
who
was
next
him
it
occurred
with
the
suddenness
of
pure
accident
and
the
next
she
saw
was
the
stranger
plunging
downward
along
the
piling
clutching
wildly
at
the
vessel
side
while
boyd
clung
to
the
as
if
about
to
lose
his
balance
the
man
cry
as
he
struck
the
water
alarmed
the
crowd
and
caused
a
momentary
stampede
in
which
cherry
and
boyd
were
thrust
shoreward
but
the
confusion
quickly
subsided
as
an
officer
flung
a
to
the
gasping
creature
beneath
a
moment
later
the
hatless
spy
was
dragged
to
the
dock
indignant
and
sputtering
i
very
sorry
sir
boyd
apologized
profusely
it
was
all
my
fault
the
plank
was
steep
and
i
was
forced
off
my
feet
whenever
followed
too
closely
i
lose
my
head
it
a
weakness
i
have
the
man
ceased
cursing
to
dart
a
sharp
glance
at
him
but
he
was
still
too
unmanned
by
his
cold
immersion
to
do
more
than
chatter
angrily
in
the
hubbub
emerson
led
his
companion
out
into
the
street
where
she
beheld
him
shaking
with
suppressed
laughter
boyd
she
cried
in
a
shocked
voice
then
it
was
you
you
might
have
killed
him
suppose
his
head
had
struck
a
timber
yes
that
would
have
been
too
bad
he
declared
then
at
the
sight
of
her
face
his
chuckle
changed
to
a
wolfish
snarl
he
know
enough
to
keep
away
from
me
hereafter
i
wo
play
with
him
the
next
time
do
do
i
never
saw
you
look
so
why
it
might
have
been
murder
well
he
stared
at
her
curiously
i
i
did
think
it
of
you
she
shuddered
weakly
but
he
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
with
a
finality
that
cut
off
further
discussion
he
a
spy
i
wo
be
spied
upon
when
boyd
entered
his
room
at
the
hotel
whither
he
had
gone
after
leaving
cherry
at
hilliard
bank
big
george
greeted
him
excitedly
here
hell
to
pay
we
ca
get
that
barkentine
the
why
not
the
charter
was
all
arranged
the
agent
telephoned
that
we
could
have
her
what
reasons
did
he
offer
none
we
ca
have
her
that
all
she
the
only
available
ship
on
the
sound
our
stuff
will
be
here
in
a
fortnight
some
of
it
will
what
do
you
boilers
held
up
boilers
yes
read
that
balt
tossed
him
a
telegram
delayed
read
boyd
well
this
is
growing
interesting
thank
heaven
other
people
handle
machinery
he
reached
for
a
blank
and
hurriedly
wrote
a
message
cancelling
his
order
i
guess
cherry
was
right
marsh
is
fighting
to
delay
us
he
began
a
recital
of
the
morning
occurrences
but
before
he
had
finished
he
was
called
to
the
telephone
more
bad
news
he
exclaimed
as
he
the
room
the
company
say
they
ca
make
delivery
of
their
order
i
wonder
what
next
we
do
need
nothing
more
to
cripple
us
george
declared
blankly
any
one
of
these
blows
is
a
knockout
it
was
perhaps
an
hour
later
that
cherry
entered
unannounced
i
just
ran
in
for
a
minute
to
tell
you
something
new
when
i
came
up
from
the
bank
the
elevator
boy
at
the
hotel
made
a
mistake
and
carried
me
past
my
floor
without
noticing
the
difference
i
went
down
the
hall
and
whom
should
i
run
right
into
coming
out
of
a
room
but
our
detective
as
he
opened
the
door
i
heard
him
say
well
sir
report
to
whom
was
he
reporting
i
do
know
a
few
minutes
later
i
called
you
up
to
tell
you
about
it
but
while
i
was
waiting
for
my
number
the
operator
evidently
got
the
wires
crossed
or
left
a
switch
open
for
i
heard
this
much
of
a
conversation
contract
covers
fifty
thousand
cases
at
five
dollars
we
thought
that
was
at
least
twenty
cents
under
the
market
i
was
about
to
ring
off
when
i
remembered
that
you
had
sold
your
output
of
fifty
thousand
cases
to
bloc
company
for
five
dollars
a
case
so
i
listened
on
a
chance
and
heard
another
voice
reply
whose
voice
i
do
know
it
said
undersell
that
by
one
dollar
lord
said
the
first
speaker
means
a
loss
of
and
then
i
was
cut
off
i
thought
i
better
come
over
in
person
instead
of
trusting
to
the
wire
and
you
did
recognize
either
speaker
no
but
i
discovered
at
the
office
that
rooms
and
the
suite
i
saw
that
detective
coming
out
of
are
occupied
by
a
jones
of
new
york
who
arrived
three
days
ago
i
bet
anything
you
please
that
you
hear
from
bloc
company
within
hours
and
that
the
occupant
of
those
rooms
at
the
hotel
buller
is
willis
marsh
big
george
began
to
mutter
profanely
it
looks
like
they
had
us
and
all
because
fraser
tongue
is
hung
in
the
middle
all
the
same
we
fight
it
out
said
emerson
grimly
if
i
can
raise
that
money
in
tacoma
again
the
telephone
bell
buzzed
noisily
bloc
company
predicted
cherry
but
for
once
she
was
wrong
a
call
from
tacoma
said
boyd
the
receiver
to
his
ear
it
must
be
the
second
national
they
were
not
to
let
me
know
till
through
the
open
door
of
the
adjoining
room
his
words
came
distinctly
while
the
others
listened
in
tense
silence
hello
yes
this
is
boyd
emerson
then
followed
a
pause
during
which
the
thin
rasping
voice
of
the
distant
speaker
murmured
unintelligibly
why
not
ca
you
give
me
a
reason
i
thought
you
said
very
well
emerson
hung
up
the
receiver
carefully
and
with
the
same
deliberation
turned
to
face
his
companions
he
nodded
and
spread
his
hands
outward
in
an
unmistakable
gesture
what
already
queried
the
girl
they
must
have
been
reached
by
that
detective
may
have
called
marsh
up
from
there
that
means
it
wo
do
any
good
to
try
further
in
tacoma
the
other
banks
have
undoubtedly
been
fixed
or
they
soon
will
be
if
i
can
slip
away
undiscovered
i
try
vancouver
next
but
i
have
much
hope
it
looks
bad
does
it
said
cherry
as
we
stand
at
present
boyd
acknowledged
we
are
the
owners
of
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
worth
of
useless
machinery
and
unsalable
supplies
and
all
mused
the
girl
because
of
a
loose
tongue
and
a
little
type
chapter
xv
the
doors
of
the
vault
swing
shut
i
say
old
man
just
how
do
we
stack
up
questioned
alton
clyde
when
later
in
the
week
he
had
succeeded
in
pinning
boyd
down
for
a
moment
conversation
blessed
if
i
know
what
going
on
well
we
up
against
it
how
that
newspaper
story
started
it
emerson
teeth
snapped
angrily
and
clyde
colorless
eyes
shifted
fraser
let
his
tongue
wag
and
immediately
the
banks
closed
up
on
me
i
tried
every
one
in
this
city
in
tacoma
in
vancouver
and
in
victoria
but
it
seems
that
they
have
all
been
advised
of
war
in
the
canning
business
our
ship
was
taken
away
from
us
and
although
i
have
found
another
i
afraid
to
charter
it
until
i
see
my
way
out
then
there
have
been
delays
in
various
shipments
boilers
tin
lumber
and
all
that
i
worried
you
with
half
the
details
but
george
and
i
have
forgotten
what
a
night
rest
looks
like
now
bloc
company
are
trying
to
get
out
of
their
contract
to
take
our
output
emerson
sighed
heavily
and
sank
deeper
into
his
chair
his
weariness
of
mind
and
body
betrayed
by
his
utter
relaxation
i
guess
we
are
done
for
i
about
all
in
glory
be
exclaimed
the
dapper
little
with
a
comical
furrow
of
care
upon
his
brow
when
you
give
up
it
is
quitting
time
i
have
given
up
i
am
doing
all
i
can
but
things
are
in
a
diabolical
tangle
some
of
our
supplies
are
here
others
are
laid
out
on
the
road
some
seem
to
be
utterly
lost
we
have
had
to
make
substitutions
of
machinery
our
bills
are
overdue
and
but
what
the
use
we
need
money
that
the
crux
of
the
whole
affair
when
hilliard
balked
he
threw
the
whole
proposition
and
i
stung
for
ten
thou
reflected
clyde
lugubriously
ten
thousand
drops
of
my
heart
red
blood
good
lord
i
a
fierce
business
man
say
i
ought
to
be
the
purchasing
agent
for
the
alliance
gold
bricks
are
my
specialty
i
have
won
a
bet
since
the
battle
of
bull
run
what
about
the
thousand
dollars
that
you
raised
emerson
asked
clyde
began
to
laugh
shrilly
that
painfully
funny
i
thought
about
that
the
situation
may
be
remarkable
but
i
do
see
anything
humorous
in
it
said
emerson
dryly
oh
you
would
if
you
only
knew
but
i
ca
tell
you
what
it
is
you
see
i
promised
not
to
divulge
where
the
money
came
from
and
when
i
give
my
word
i
a
regular
sphinx
but
it
funny
after
an
instant
he
said
in
all
seriousness
if
hilliard
holds
the
combination
to
this
thing
why
do
you
have
cherry
help
us
cherry
how
can
she
help
she
can
do
anything
she
wants
with
him
what
do
you
mean
i
may
be
a
heavy
autumn
frost
as
a
financier
the
younger
man
remarked
but
when
it
comes
to
women
i
as
wise
as
a
wharf
rat
been
watching
her
work
and
it
great
people
have
begun
to
talk
about
it
every
night
it
a
dinner
and
a
theatre
party
every
day
orchids
and
other
extortionate
bouquets
with
tied
on
with
blue
ribbons
his
motor
is
at
her
disposal
at
all
times
and
she
treats
his
chauffeur
with
open
contempt
if
that
does
signify
nonsense
exclaimed
the
other
with
disgust
she
is
too
nice
a
girl
for
that
you
have
misconstrued
hilliard
politeness
finding
his
worldly
wisdom
at
issue
clyde
defended
himself
stoutly
i
tell
you
he
has
gone
off
his
blooming
balance
i
know
the
symptoms
leave
it
to
old
doctor
clyde
you
say
other
people
have
noticed
it
i
do
everybody
in
town
except
you
and
the
at
the
corner
he
blind
emerson
rose
from
his
chair
and
began
to
pace
about
slowly
if
hilliard
has
turned
that
girl
head
with
his
attentions
i
clyde
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
in
open
derision
do
worry
about
her
he
is
the
one
to
be
pitied
she
taking
him
on
a
trip
of
the
most
approved
and
expensive
character
she
is
that
kind
emerson
hotly
denied
now
do
be
a
boy
until
your
beard
trips
you
up
that
girl
is
about
to
break
into
old
hilliard
vault
and
while
she
in
there
with
the
gas
lighted
and
a
suit
case
to
lug
off
the
why
not
tell
her
to
toss
in
a
few
bundles
for
us
if
i
ca
get
along
without
taking
money
from
a
woman
i
throw
up
the
whole
deal
the
curious
look
which
boyd
had
noted
once
before
came
into
eyes
and
this
time
to
judge
by
the
young
fellow
manner
he
might
have
translated
it
into
words
but
for
the
entrance
at
that
moment
of
cherry
herself
accompanied
by
fingerless
fraser
what
luck
in
vancouver
she
inquired
none
whatever
the
banks
wo
listen
to
me
and
i
ca
interest
any
private
parties
see
here
volunteered
fraser
why
do
you
let
me
sell
some
of
your
stock
i
there
with
the
big
talk
emerson
turned
on
him
suddenly
you
have
demonstrated
that
if
you
had
kept
your
mouth
shut
we
have
been
at
sea
by
now
the
fellow
face
paled
slightly
as
he
replied
i
told
you
once
that
i
did
tip
your
mit
do
keep
that
up
cried
boyd
his
temper
ready
to
give
way
i
can
put
up
with
anything
but
a
lie
noting
the
signs
of
a
rising
storm
clyde
scrambled
out
of
his
chair
saying
well
i
think
i
be
going
he
picked
up
his
hat
and
stick
and
hurriedly
left
the
room
followed
in
every
movement
by
the
angry
eyes
of
fraser
who
seemed
on
the
point
of
an
explosion
i
do
believe
fraser
gave
out
the
story
said
cherry
at
which
he
flashed
her
a
grateful
glance
you
can
make
a
book
on
that
he
declared
i
may
be
a
crook
but
no
sucker
and
i
know
when
to
hobble
my
talk
and
when
to
slip
the
bridle
i
did
five
years
once
when
it
was
coming
to
me
and
i
can
do
it
again
if
i
have
to
he
jammed
his
hat
down
over
his
ears
and
walked
out
i
really
think
he
is
telling
the
truth
said
the
girl
he
is
dreadfully
hurt
to
think
you
distrust
him
he
and
i
have
threshed
that
out
emerson
declared
pacing
the
room
with
nervous
strides
when
i
think
what
an
idiotic
trifle
it
was
that
caused
this
disaster
i
could
throttle
him
and
i
would
if
i
blame
myself
for
it
he
paused
to
stare
unseeingly
at
her
waiting
for
the
crash
to
come
before
i
walk
into
room
at
the
hotel
buller
and
settle
with
jones
of
new
york
you
are
seriously
thinking
of
any
such
melodramatic
finish
are
you
she
inquired
when
i
first
met
you
in
kalvik
i
said
i
would
stop
at
nothing
to
succeed
well
i
meant
it
i
am
more
desperate
now
than
i
was
then
i
could
have
stood
over
that
wretch
at
the
dock
the
other
day
and
watched
him
drown
because
he
dared
to
step
in
between
me
and
my
work
i
could
walk
into
willis
marsh
room
and
strangle
him
if
by
so
doing
i
could
win
yes
he
checked
her
i
know
i
am
wrong
but
that
is
how
i
feel
i
have
wrung
my
soul
dry
i
have
toiled
and
sweated
and
suffered
for
three
years
constantly
held
down
by
the
grip
of
some
cursed
evil
fortune
a
dozen
times
i
have
climbed
to
the
very
brink
of
success
only
to
be
thrust
down
by
some
trivial
cause
like
this
can
you
wonder
that
i
have
watched
my
honor
decay
and
crumble
that
ceased
to
care
what
means
i
use
so
long
as
i
succeed
i
have
fought
fair
so
far
but
now
i
tell
you
i
come
to
a
point
where
sacrifice
anything
everything
to
get
what
i
want
and
i
want
that
girl
you
are
tired
and
overwrought
said
cherry
quietly
you
do
mean
what
you
say
the
success
of
this
enterprise
with
any
happiness
it
may
bring
you
is
worth
a
human
life
nor
is
it
worth
what
you
are
suffering
perhaps
not
from
your
point
of
view
he
said
roughly
then
struck
his
palm
with
closed
fist
what
an
idiot
i
was
to
begin
all
this
to
think
i
could
win
with
no
weapons
and
no
aid
except
a
fisherman
an
imbecile
a
confidence
man
and
a
woman
supplemented
cherry
then
more
gravely
i
the
one
to
blame
i
got
you
into
it
no
i
blame
no
one
but
myself
whatever
you
responsible
for
there
only
one
person
you
harmed
yourself
what
do
you
mean
asked
cherry
her
surprise
left
him
unimpressed
let
be
frank
he
said
it
is
best
to
have
such
things
out
and
be
done
with
them
i
traded
my
friendship
for
money
and
i
am
ruined
you
are
staking
your
honor
against
hilliard
her
look
commanded
him
pleaded
with
him
to
stop
but
her
silence
only
made
him
the
more
fiercely
determined
to
force
an
explanation
oh
i
in
no
mood
to
speak
gently
he
said
then
added
with
a
sting
of
contempt
in
his
tone
i
did
think
you
would
pay
quite
that
price
for
your
cherry
malotte
paled
to
her
lips
and
when
she
spoke
her
voice
was
oddly
harsh
kindly
be
more
explicit
i
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
then
for
your
own
good
you
better
understand
according
to
accepted
standards
there
is
one
thing
no
woman
should
trade
upon
go
on
you
have
set
yourself
to
trap
hilliard
and
from
what
i
hear
you
are
succeeding
he
is
a
married
man
he
is
twice
your
age
he
is
notorious
all
of
which
you
must
know
and
yet
you
have
deliberately
yielded
yourself
to
him
for
a
price
suddenly
he
found
the
girl
standing
over
him
with
burning
eyes
and
quivering
body
what
right
have
you
to
say
such
things
to
me
she
cried
a
moment
ago
you
acknowledged
yourself
a
murderer
at
least
in
thought
you
said
you
would
sacrifice
anything
or
everything
to
gain
your
ends
do
you
think
i
like
that
too
are
my
methods
to
be
called
shameful
because
your
own
are
criminal
and
suppose
they
were
do
you
think
that
you
and
your
love
for
that
unfeeling
woman
who
sent
you
out
to
toil
and
suffer
and
sweat
your
soul
dry
in
the
solitude
of
that
horrible
country
are
the
only
issues
in
the
world
we
wo
speak
of
her
he
broke
in
sharply
oh
yes
we
will
you
say
i
have
set
a
price
on
myself
well
she
set
a
price
on
herself
but
you
ca
see
it
her
price
was
your
honor
that
has
crumbled
your
conscience
that
has
rotted
you
have
paid
it
and
you
would
pay
double
if
she
exacted
it
but
one
thing
you
shall
not
do
you
shall
not
judge
of
my
bargains
nor
decide
what
i
have
paid
to
any
man
never
before
had
boyd
seen
a
woman
so
transformed
by
the
passion
of
anger
her
lids
had
drooped
half
hiding
her
eyes
her
whole
expression
had
hardened
she
was
the
picture
of
defiant
fury
the
mask
had
slipped
and
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
naked
passionate
soul
upheaved
to
its
depths
oddly
enough
he
felt
it
thrill
him
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
you
are
your
own
mistress
and
you
have
the
right
to
make
any
bargain
you
choose
she
turned
away
and
going
to
the
window
stared
down
upon
the
busy
street
striving
to
calm
herself
for
a
time
the
room
was
silent
save
for
the
muffled
sounds
from
below
then
she
faced
him
again
and
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
misty
with
tears
i
want
you
to
know
she
said
that
i
understand
your
position
perfectly
if
you
do
succeed
you
not
only
lose
the
girl
but
ruin
yourself
for
you
can
never
repay
the
men
who
trusted
you
that
is
a
very
big
thing
to
a
man
i
know
yet
there
must
be
a
way
out
there
always
is
perhaps
it
will
present
itself
when
you
least
expect
it
she
gave
him
a
tired
little
smile
before
lowering
her
veil
he
rose
and
laid
his
hand
on
her
arm
forgive
my
brutal
bluntness
i
not
clever
at
such
things
but
i
would
have
said
as
much
to
my
sister
if
i
had
one
it
was
an
honest
attempt
to
comfort
her
but
it
failed
she
said
you
must
give
up
all
the
way
back
to
her
hotel
her
mind
dwelt
bitterly
upon
his
parting
words
his
sister
his
sister
she
kept
repeating
god
ca
he
see
if
he
had
shown
even
a
momentary
jealousy
of
hilliard
it
would
not
have
been
so
hard
but
this
impersonal
attitude
was
maddening
the
man
had
but
one
idea
in
the
world
one
dream
one
vision
another
woman
alone
in
her
room
she
still
felt
the
flesh
of
her
arm
burn
where
he
had
laid
his
hand
and
then
came
the
thrill
of
that
forgotten
kiss
how
many
times
had
she
felt
the
pressure
of
his
lips
upon
hers
how
many
hopes
had
she
built
upon
that
memory
but
the
thought
of
boyd
indifference
rose
in
sharp
conflict
with
the
tenderness
that
prompted
her
to
help
him
at
any
cost
after
all
why
not
take
what
was
offered
her
and
let
this
man
shift
for
himself
why
not
live
her
life
as
she
had
planned
it
before
he
came
the
reward
was
at
hand
she
had
only
to
take
it
and
let
him
go
down
as
a
sacrifice
to
that
he
coveted
dusk
was
falling
when
she
ceased
pacing
the
floor
and
with
set
defiant
face
went
to
the
telephone
to
call
up
hilliard
at
the
rainier
club
i
have
thought
over
your
proposition
and
i
have
changed
my
mind
she
said
yes
you
may
send
the
car
for
me
at
seven
then
in
reply
to
some
request
she
laughed
back
through
white
lips
very
well
if
you
wish
it
the
blue
dress
yes
the
blue
decollete
dress
she
hung
up
the
receiver
then
stood
with
hands
clinched
while
a
shiver
ran
through
her
slender
body
she
stepped
to
a
closet
and
flung
open
the
door
to
stare
at
the
array
of
gowns
so
this
is
the
end
of
my
good
resolutions
she
laughed
and
snatched
a
garment
recklessly
from
its
hook
now
for
all
the
miserable
tricks
of
the
trade
chapter
xvi
willis
marsh
comes
out
from
cover
george
balt
clyde
and
fraser
formed
a
glum
trio
as
they
sat
in
a
nook
of
the
hotel
cafe
sipping
moodily
at
their
glasses
when
on
the
following
afternoon
emerson
joined
them
but
they
sensed
some
untoward
happening
even
before
he
spoke
for
his
face
wore
a
look
of
dazed
incredulity
and
his
manner
was
so
extraordinary
that
they
questioned
in
chorus
what
the
matter
are
you
sick
no
said
he
but
i
i
must
have
lost
my
mind
what
is
it
the
trick
is
turned
the
trick
i
have
raised
the
money
with
a
shout
that
startled
the
other
occupants
of
the
room
balt
and
clyde
jumped
to
their
feet
and
began
to
caper
about
in
a
frenzy
even
fingerless
fraser
expressionless
face
cracked
in
a
wide
grin
of
amazement
about
noon
i
was
called
on
the
by
hilliard
he
asked
me
to
come
down
to
the
bank
at
once
and
i
went
he
said
he
had
reconsidered
and
wanted
to
put
up
the
money
it
up
he
back
us
i
got
it
in
writing
it
all
cinched
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
more
if
we
need
it
you
must
have
made
a
great
talk
declared
clyde
i
said
nothing
he
offered
it
himself
as
a
personal
loan
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
bank
well
i
cried
big
george
and
that
goes
two
ways
supplemented
fraser
i
going
to
tell
cherry
now
she
will
be
delighted
alton
clyde
tittered
i
told
you
she
could
pull
it
off
he
said
this
was
hilliard
own
notion
boyd
returned
coldly
he
merely
reconsidered
his
decision
and
turn
over
you
on
your
back
it
was
only
yesterday
afternoon
that
i
talked
with
cherry
i
dare
say
she
has
seen
him
since
well
i
happen
to
know
that
she
has
as
i
came
home
last
night
i
saw
them
together
they
came
out
of
that
french
cafe
across
the
street
and
got
into
hilliard
car
she
was
dressed
up
like
a
pony
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
demanded
fingerless
fraser
she
pulled
the
old
fellow
leg
that
all
explained
alton
well
it
was
your
leg
was
it
inquired
fraser
sourly
no
i
no
kick
coming
i
think
she
mighty
clever
if
i
thought
she
had
done
that
said
emerson
slowly
i
touch
a
penny
of
the
money
i
do
care
where
the
money
came
from
or
how
it
got
here
rumbled
balt
it
here
that
enough
i
care
and
i
intend
to
find
out
oh
come
now
do
spoil
a
good
piece
of
work
cautioned
clyde
visibly
perturbed
at
boyd
expression
you
know
you
are
the
only
one
to
consider
in
this
matter
the
rest
of
us
are
entitled
to
a
for
heaven
sake
try
to
control
this
excess
of
virtue
and
when
you
get
into
one
of
those
martin
luther
moods
just
reflect
that
i
have
laid
ten
thousand
aching
simoleons
on
the
altar
sure
supplemented
george
and
look
at
me
and
cherry
success
means
as
much
to
her
as
it
does
to
any
of
us
and
if
she
pulled
this
off
you
bet
she
knew
what
she
was
doing
anyhow
you
ai
got
any
right
to
break
up
the
play
but
boyd
clung
to
his
point
with
a
stubbornness
which
he
himself
found
it
difficult
to
explain
the
arguments
of
the
others
only
annoyed
him
the
walk
to
cherry
hotel
afforded
him
time
for
reflection
which
while
it
deepened
his
doubt
somewhat
lessened
his
impatience
and
when
he
was
shown
into
her
presence
he
did
not
begin
in
the
impetuous
manner
he
had
designed
a
certain
hesitation
and
dread
of
the
truth
mastered
him
and
moreover
the
girl
appearance
dismayed
him
she
seemed
almost
she
was
listless
and
fagged
upon
his
announcement
of
the
good
news
she
only
smiled
wearily
and
said
i
told
you
not
to
give
up
the
unexpected
always
happens
and
was
it
unexpected
to
you
he
asked
awkwardly
what
happens
is
nearly
always
unexpected
when
it
good
not
to
the
one
who
brings
it
about
what
makes
you
think
i
had
anything
to
do
with
it
you
were
with
hilliard
last
night
she
nodded
slightly
we
closed
our
negotiations
for
the
last
night
how
did
you
come
out
he
takes
it
over
and
does
the
development
work
she
answered
that
means
that
you
are
independent
that
you
can
leave
the
north
country
and
do
all
the
things
you
want
to
do
this
time
her
smile
was
puzzling
you
do
seem
very
glad
no
realization
discounts
anticipation
about
ninety
per
cent
but
let
talk
about
me
i
i
unstrung
i
sorry
you
are
going
back
to
kalvik
he
said
with
genuine
regret
but
i
am
she
declared
quickly
i
going
back
with
you
and
george
if
you
will
let
me
i
want
to
see
the
finish
of
our
enterprise
see
here
cherry
i
hope
you
did
influence
hilliard
in
this
affair
why
probe
the
matter
because
i
have
lost
all
my
manhood
he
answered
roughly
yesterday
you
assumed
the
blame
for
this
trouble
and
spoke
of
sacrifices
and
well
i
do
know
much
about
women
but
for
all
i
know
you
may
have
some
ridiculous
quixotic
strain
in
your
i
hope
you
did
what
well
do
anything
you
may
be
sorry
for
at
last
he
detected
a
gleam
of
spirit
in
her
eyes
suppose
i
did
what
difference
to
you
would
that
make
he
shifted
uncomfortably
under
her
scrutiny
suppose
that
hilliard
had
called
on
me
for
some
great
sacrifice
before
he
gave
up
that
money
would
you
allow
it
to
affect
you
of
course
he
answered
then
unable
to
sit
still
under
her
searching
gaze
he
arose
with
flushed
face
to
meet
further
discomfiture
as
she
continued
even
if
it
meant
your
own
ruin
the
loss
of
the
fortune
you
have
raised
among
your
friends
money
that
is
entrusted
to
you
and
and
the
relinquishment
of
miss
wayland
honestly
now
her
voice
had
softened
and
dropped
to
a
lower
key
would
it
make
any
difference
certainly
how
much
difference
i
in
a
very
embarrassing
position
he
said
slowly
you
must
realize
that
with
others
depending
on
me
i
not
free
to
follow
my
own
inclinations
she
uttered
a
little
mocking
laugh
pardon
me
it
was
not
a
fair
question
and
i
should
have
asked
it
but
your
hesitation
was
sufficient
answer
then
as
he
broke
into
a
heated
denial
she
went
on
like
most
men
you
think
a
woman
has
but
one
asset
upon
which
to
trade
however
if
i
felt
responsible
for
your
difficulties
that
was
my
affair
and
if
i
determined
to
help
extricate
you
that
also
concerned
me
alone
he
stepped
forward
as
if
to
protest
but
she
silenced
his
speech
with
an
imperious
little
stamp
of
her
foot
this
spasm
of
righteousness
on
your
part
is
only
temporary
yes
it
is
as
he
attempted
to
break
in
and
now
that
you
have
voiced
it
and
freed
your
mind
you
can
feel
at
rest
have
you
not
repeatedly
asserted
that
to
win
miss
wayland
you
would
use
any
means
that
offered
you
are
not
really
sincere
in
this
sudden
squeamishness
and
i
would
like
you
better
if
you
had
seized
your
advantage
at
once
without
stopping
to
consider
whence
or
how
it
came
that
would
have
been
primitive
elemental
and
every
woman
loves
an
elemental
lover
he
was
no
subtle
casuist
and
found
himself
without
words
to
reply
the
girl
sharp
challenging
of
his
motives
had
disconcerted
him
without
helping
him
to
a
clearer
understanding
of
his
own
mind
and
in
spite
of
the
cheering
turn
his
fortunes
had
taken
it
was
in
no
very
amiable
mood
that
he
left
her
at
last
no
whit
the
wiser
for
all
his
questioning
in
the
hotel
lobby
below
he
encountered
the
newspaper
reporter
who
had
fallen
under
fraser
spell
upon
their
first
arrival
from
the
north
the
man
greeted
him
eagerly
how
emerson
can
you
give
me
any
news
about
the
fisheries
no
i
thought
there
might
be
something
new
bearing
on
my
story
indeed
so
you
are
the
chap
who
wrote
that
article
some
time
ago
eh
yes
sir
good
was
it
doubtless
from
the
newspaper
point
of
view
where
did
you
get
it
from
mr
clyde
clyde
you
mean
fraser
frobisher
i
should
say
no
sir
alton
clyde
he
was
pretty
talkative
the
night
i
saw
him
the
reporter
laughed
meaningly
drunk
do
you
mean
oh
not
exactly
drunk
but
pretty
wet
he
knew
what
he
was
saying
however
ca
you
give
me
something
more
nothing
boyd
hurried
to
his
hotel
a
prey
to
mingled
anger
and
contrition
so
fraser
had
told
the
truth
after
all
and
with
a
kind
of
sullen
loyalty
had
chosen
to
remain
under
a
cloud
himself
rather
than
inform
on
a
friend
it
was
quite
in
keeping
with
the
fellow
peculiar
temperament
as
it
happened
boyd
found
the
two
men
together
and
lost
no
time
in
acquainting
them
with
his
discovery
i
come
to
apologize
to
you
he
said
to
fraser
who
grinned
broadly
and
was
seized
with
a
sudden
abashment
which
stilled
his
tongue
emerson
turned
to
clyde
why
did
you
permit
me
to
do
this
injustice
i
i
did
mean
to
give
out
any
secrets
i
do
remember
doing
it
alton
apologized
lamely
you
know
i
ca
drink
much
i
remember
a
thing
about
it
honestly
boyd
regarded
him
coldly
but
the
young
man
penitence
seemed
so
genuine
he
looked
so
weak
so
pitifully
incompetent
that
the
other
lacked
heart
to
chastise
him
it
requires
resistance
to
develop
heat
and
against
the
absence
of
character
it
is
impossible
to
create
any
sort
of
emotion
when
you
got
drunk
that
night
you
not
only
worked
a
great
hardship
on
all
of
us
but
afterward
you
allowed
me
to
misjudge
a
very
faithful
man
declared
boyd
fraser
ways
are
not
mine
and
i
have
said
harsh
things
to
him
when
my
temper
prompted
but
i
am
not
ungrateful
for
the
service
he
has
done
me
and
the
sacrifices
he
has
made
now
alton
you
have
chosen
to
join
us
in
a
desperate
venture
and
the
farther
we
go
the
more
vigorous
will
be
the
resistance
we
shall
meet
if
you
keep
a
close
mouth
and
do
as
you
are
told
you
better
go
back
to
chicago
by
rare
good
luck
we
have
averted
this
disaster
but
i
have
no
hope
of
being
so
fortunate
again
do
climb
any
higher
admonished
fingerless
fraser
he
all
fluffed
up
now
i
lay
you
eight
to
one
he
do
make
another
break
of
the
kind
no
i
was
so
pickled
that
i
forgot
i
even
spoke
about
the
business
i
break
my
corkscrew
and
seal
my
flask
and
from
this
moment
until
we
come
out
next
fall
the
demon
rum
and
i
are
divorced
is
that
good
news
everything
is
a
joke
to
you
is
it
said
boyd
if
this
trip
does
make
a
man
of
you
you
never
grow
up
now
i
got
work
for
all
of
us
including
you
fraser
what
is
it
go
down
to
the
and
trace
a
shipment
of
machinery
while
i
nix
that
ai
my
line
if
you
need
a
piece
of
rough
money
quick
why
i
take
my
gat
and
stick
somebody
up
in
an
alley
or
i
feel
out
a
safe
combination
for
you
in
the
dark
but
this
chaperoning
freight
cars
ai
my
game
i
only
crab
it
i
thought
you
wanted
to
help
i
do
sure
i
do
i
be
glad
when
you
on
your
way
but
i
must
respectfully
duck
all
and
shipping
receipts
you
are
merely
lazy
emerson
smiled
nevertheless
if
we
get
in
a
tight
place
i
make
you
take
a
hand
in
spite
of
yourself
any
time
you
need
me

lighting
a
fresh
cigar
only
do
give
me
child
work
as
if
hilliard
conversion
had
marked
the
of
their
luck
the
partners
now
entered
upon
a
period
of
almost
uninterrupted
success
in
the
reaction
from
their
recent
discouragement
they
took
hold
of
their
labors
with
fresh
energy
and
fortune
aided
them
in
unexpected
ways
boyd
signed
his
charter
securing
a
tramp
steamer
then
discharging
at
tacoma
balt
closed
his
contracts
for
chinese
labor
and
the
scattered
of
material
which
had
been
lost
en
route
or
mysteriously
laid
out
on
sidings
began
to
come
in
as
if
of
their
own
accord
those
supplies
which
had
been
denied
them
they
found
in
unexpected
quarters
close
at
hand
and
almost
before
they
were
aware
of
it
bedford
had
finished
unloading
and
was
coaling
at
the
bunkers
a
brigade
of
orientals
and
a
miniature
army
of
fishermen
had
appeared
as
if
by
magic
and
were
quartered
in
the
lower
part
of
the
city
awaiting
shipment
boyd
and
big
george
worked
unceasingly
in
the
midst
of
a
maelstrom
of
confusion
the
centre
of
which
was
the
dock
there
one
throbbing
april
evening
bedford
berthed
ready
to
receive
her
cargo
and
the
two
men
made
their
way
toward
their
hotel
weary
but
glowing
with
the
grateful
sense
of
an
arduous
duty
well
performed
the
following
morning
would
find
the
wharf
swarming
with
stevedores
and
echoing
to
the
rattle
of
trucks
the
clank
of
hoists
and
the
shrill
whistles
of
the
signalmen
looks
like
they
could
stop
us
now
said
balt
it
does
agreed
emerson
we
ought
to
clear
in
four
days
that
be
the
it
smells
like
an
early
spring
too
the
fisherman
observed
sniffing
the
air
if
it
is
we
be
in
kalvik
the
first
week
in
may
is
your
sense
of
smell
sharp
enough
to
tell
what
happening
up
there
sure
suppose
it
a
backward
season
then
we
lay
in
the
ice
alongside
the
company
boats
till
she
breaks
that
may
be
in
june
i
would
like
to
get
in
early
and
have
the
buildings
started
before
marsh
arrives
there
no
telling
what
he
may
try
george
gave
his
companion
a
short
nod
and
there
ai
no
telling
what
we
may
try
right
back
at
him
anyhow
he
have
to
fight
in
the
open
and
that
better
than
this
that
we
been
doing
i
off
to
tell
cherry
said
boyd
she
need
to
be
getting
ready
his
course
took
him
past
hilliard
bank
and
when
abreast
of
it
he
nearly
collided
with
a
man
who
came
hurrying
forth
an
angry
scowl
between
his
eyes
giving
evidence
of
a
surly
humor
in
the
man
who
absorbed
in
his
own
anger
was
rushing
by
without
raising
his
eyes
emerson
recognized
the
manager
of
the
north
american
packers
association
mr
marsh
marsh
whirled
about
eh
ah
with
a
visible
effort
he
smoothed
the
lines
from
his
brow
his
full
lips
lost
their
angry
pout
and
he
showed
his
teeth
in
a
startled
apprehensive
smile
why
yes
it
emerson
how
are
you
mr
emerson
he
extended
a
soft
hand
which
boyd
took
apparently
reassured
by
this
mute
response
marsh
continued
i
heard
you
were
in
town
how
is
the
new
cannery
coming
on
nicely
thank
you
when
did
you
arrive
from
the
east
i
just
got
in
have
had
time
to
get
straightened
out
yet
we
wayland
and
i
were
speaking
of
you
before
i
left
chicago
we
were
somewhat
surprised
to
learn
that
you
were
engaging
in
the
same
line
of
business
as
ourselves
doubtless
i
told
him
there
was
room
for
us
all
you
did
yes
i
assured
him
that
his
resentment
was
unwarranted
he
resents
something
does
he
well
naturally
marsh
declared
with
a
wintry
smile
in
view
of
the
circumstances
i
may
truthfully
say
that
his
feelings
embrace
not
only
a
sense
of
resentment
but
the
firmly
fixed
idea
that
he
has
been
betrayed
however
you
are
no
doubt
aware
of
all
that
you
have
an
able
champion
on
the
ground
he
looked
out
across
the
street
abstractedly
miss
wayland
and
i
did
our
utmost
to
convince
him
you
merely
took
a
legitimate
commercial
advantage
in
dining
at
his
house
the
night
before
you
left
it
was
good
of
you
to
take
my
part
said
boyd
with
such
an
air
of
simple
cordiality
that
marsh
shot
a
startled
glance
at
him
now
that
we
are
to
be
neighbors
this
summer
i
hope
we
will
get
well
acquainted
for
wayland
spoke
highly
of
you
and
strongly
advised
me
to
pattern
after
you
marsh
hid
his
bewilderment
behind
an
expression
which
he
strove
to
make
as
friendly
as
emerson
own
i
understand
you
are
banking
here
he
said
jerking
his
head
toward
the
building
at
his
back
yes
i
was
offered
a
number
of
propositions
but
hilliard
was
so
insistent
and
made
such
substantial
inducements
that
i
finally
placed
the
business
with
him
the
animosity
that
glimmered
for
one
fleeting
instant
in
marsh
eyes
amused
boyd
greatly
advertising
as
it
did
that
for
once
the
executive
felt
himself
at
a
disadvantage
the
younger
man
never
doubted
for
an
instant
that
his
coup
in
securing
hilliard
assistance
at
the
eleventh
hour
was
responsible
for
his
enemy
sudden
appearance
from
cover
nor
that
the
arrival
of
bedford
had
brought
marsh
to
the
banker
office
out
of
hours
in
final
desperation
from
the
man
bearing
he
judged
that
the
interview
had
not
been
as
placid
as
a
spring
morning
and
this
awoke
in
him
not
only
a
keen
sense
of
elation
but
the
very
natural
desire
to
goad
his
opponent
all
in
all
we
have
been
singularly
fortunate
in
our
enterprise
thus
far
he
continued
smoothly
we
were
held
up
on
some
of
our
machinery
but
in
every
instance
the
delay
turned
out
a
blessing
in
disguise
for
it
enabled
us
to
buy
in
other
quarters
at
a
saving
i
delighted
to
hear
it
marsh
declared
when
do
you
sail
immediately
we
begin
to
load
i
have
changed
my
plans
somewhat
the
other
announced
i
follow
your
tracks
before
long
what
is
your
hurry
repairs
kalvik
is
our
most
important
station
so
i
want
to
get
it
in
shape
before
wayland
and
mildred
arrive
mildred
ejaculated
boyd
surprised
past
resenting
marsh
use
of
the
girl
first
name
is
she
coming
the
other
smile
was
peculiarly
irritating
oh
indeed
yes
we
expect
to
make
the
trip
quite
an
elaborate
excursion
sorry
i
ca
ask
you
to
join
us
on
the
homeward
voyage
but
he
shrugged
his
fat
shoulders
run
in
and
see
me
before
you
leave
i
may
be
able
to
give
you
some
pointers
thank
you
i
hope
you
enjoy
the
summer
up
there
in
the
wilderness
it
will
be
a
relief
to
get
away
from
all
conventions
and
restraints
the
men
extended
their
hands
and
the
trust
manager
said
in
final
invitation
drop
in
on
me
any
day
at
the
office
i
at
the
national
building
oh
you
moved
eh
said
boyd
with
a
semblance
of
careless
interest
moved
no
indeed
i
thought
you
were
still
at
hotel
buller
with
a
short
laugh
and
a
casual
gesture
of
adieu
he
turned
leaving
the
manager
of
the
trust
staring
after
him
an
astonished
pucker
upon
his
womanish
mouth
a
vindictive
glare
in
his
eyes
not
until
his
rival
had
turned
the
corner
did
willis
marsh
remove
his
gaze
then
he
found
that
he
was
trembling
as
if
from
weakness
the
ruffian
he
reached
into
his
pocket
and
produced
a
gold
repeatedly
snapping
the
heavy
sides
together
with
vicious
force
when
he
attempted
to
light
a
match
it
broke
in
his
fingers
then
in
a
temper
he
threw
the
cigarette
from
him
and
hurried
away
his
plump
face
working
his
lips
drawn
into
a
spiteful
fold
for
the
first
time
in
a
fortnight
boyd
allowed
himself
the
luxury
of
a
long
sleep
and
a
late
breakfast
on
the
following
morning
but
the
meal
came
to
an
abrupt
conclusion
when
balt
who
always
arose
with
the
sun
rushed
in
upon
him
and
exclaimed
hey
come
on
down
to
the
dock
quick
there
hell
to
pay
what
up
now
strike
the
longshoremen
have
walked
out
on
us
i
was
on
hand
early
to
oversee
the
loading
but
the
whole
mob
refused
to
commence
some
union
trouble
because
bedford
discharged
her
cargo
with
scab
labor
in
tacoma
no
in
frisco
next
to
her
last
trip
why
that
ridiculous
what
does
captain
peasley
say
he
says
i
have
to
wait
till
we
outside
before
i
can
repeat
what
he
says
together
the
two
hurried
to
the
to
find
a
crowd
of
surly
stevedores
loafing
about
the
dock
and
an
english
at
breakfast
in
his
cabin
his
attention
divided
equally
between
toast
tea
marmalade
and
profanity
the
beggars
are
mad
absolutely
mad
declared
the
captain
i
understand
it
i
still
in
my
bed
when
i
aroused
by
an
insolent
loafer
who
calls
himself
a
walking
delegate
and
tells
me
his
union
wo
load
me
until
i
pay
some
absurd
sum
what
did
you
tell
him
inquired
emerson
what
did
i
tell
him
captain
peasley
laid
down
his
knife
gently
and
wiped
the
tea
from
his
drooping
mustache
then
squared
about
in
his
seat
here
what
i
told
him
as
near
as
my
memory
serves
whereupon
he
broke
into
a
tornado
of
nautical
profanity
so
picturesquely
british
in
its
figures
and
so
in
its
vigor
that
his
auditors
could
not
but
smile
then
i
bashed
him
with
my
boot
and
bloody
well
pursued
him
over
the
rail
two
thousand
dollars
sweet
mother
of
queen
anne
would
i
look
well
now
handing
four
hundred
pounds
over
to
those
highbinders
my
owners
would
hang
me
so
they
demand
two
thousand
dollars
yes
just
because
of
some
bally
rot
about
who
may
and
who
may
not
work
for
a
living
on
the
docks
at
frisco
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
i
going
to
make
a
swimming
delegate
out
of
the
next
walking
emissary
that
boards
me
two
thousand
dollars
he
hid
half
a
slice
of
toast
behind
his
mustache
and
stirred
his
tea
violently
it
marsh
again
said
big
george
i
dare
say
emerson
answered
it
a
pure
and
simple
however
if
ships
can
be
unloaded
with
labor
they
can
be
loaded
in
the
same
manner
and
captain
peasley
talks
like
a
man
who
would
like
to
have
the
argument
out
i
want
you
to
stay
here
and
watch
our
freight
while
i
see
the
head
of
the
union
chapter
xvii
a
new
enemy
appears
when
boyd
returned
some
two
hours
later
he
found
the
dock
deserted
save
for
big
george
who
prowled
watchfully
about
the
freight
piles
well
did
you
fix
it
up
the
fisherman
inquired
no
exclaimed
boyd
it
a
rank
and
i
refused
to
be
bled
good
for
you
there
are
some
things
a
fellow
manhood
wo
stand
for
i
carry
that
freight
aboard
with
my
own
hands
before
i
be
robbed
by
a
labor
union
at
the
bidding
of
willis
marsh
say
will
you
let
me
load
this
ship
my
way
george
asked
can
you
do
it
balt
thick
lips
drew
back
from
his
yellow
teeth
in
that
smile
which
emerson
had
come
to
recognize
as
a
harbinger
of
the
violent
acts
that
rejoiced
his
lawless
soul
listen
said
he
with
a
chuckle
down
the
street
yonder
i
got
a
hundred
fishermen
half
of
them
are
drunk
at
this
minute
and
the
rest
are
half
drunk
then
they
are
of
no
use
to
us
i
do
reckon
you
ever
seen
a
herd
of
kalvik
fishermen
out
of
a
job
did
you
well
there
just
two
things
they
know
fishing
and
fighting
and
this
ai
the
fishing
season
when
they
hit
seattle
the
police
force
goes
up
into
the
residence
section
and
stufts
cotton
in
its
ears
because
the
only
thing
that
is
strong
enough
to
stand
between
a
uniform
and
a
fisherman
is
a
hill
can
you
induce
them
to
work
i
can
all
i
afraid
of
is
that
i
ca
induce
them
to
quit
liable
to
put
this
freight
aboard
bedford
and
then
pull
down
the
dock
in
a
spirit
of
playfulness
and
pile
it
in
captain
peasley
cabin
there
ai
no
convulsion
of
nature
that
equal
to
a
gang
of
idle
fishermen
when
can
they
begin
well
it
will
take
me
all
night
to
round
them
up
and
i
have
to
lick
four
or
five
but
there
ought
to
be
a
dozen
or
two
on
hand
in
the
morning
george
cast
a
roving
eye
over
the
warehouse
from
the
heavy
planking
under
foot
to
the
rafters
above
yes
he
concluded
i
do
see
nothing
breakable
so
i
guess
it
safe
would
you
like
me
to
go
with
you
the
giant
considered
him
speculatively
i
do
think
so
i
never
seen
you
in
action
no
you
better
stay
here
and
arrange
to
guard
this
stuff
till
morning
i
do
the
rest
boyd
did
not
see
him
again
that
day
nor
at
the
hotel
during
the
evening
but
on
the
following
morning
true
to
his
word
the
big
fellow
walked
into
the
warehouse
followed
by
a
score
or
more
of
fishermen
at
first
sight
there
was
nothing
imposing
about
these
men
they
were
and
unkempt
in
the
main
but
upon
closer
observation
boyd
noticed
that
they
were
and
and
walked
with
the
swinging
gait
that
comes
from
heaving
decks
while
the
majority
of
them
were
neither
distinctly
american
nor
markedly
foreign
in
appearance
being
rather
of
that
composite
caste
that
peoples
the
outer
reaches
of
the
far
west
they
were
all
deeply
browned
by
sun
and
weather
and
spoke
the
universal
idiom
of
the
sea
there
were
men
here
from
finland
and
florida
portugal
and
maine
fused
into
one
nondescript
type
by
the
of
the
frontier
some
wore
the
northern
mackinaw
in
spite
of
the
balmy
april
morning
others
were
dressed
like
ranch
hands
on
circus
day
and
a
few
with
the
ornateness
of
butte
miners
on
parade
certain
ones
displayed
fresh
contusions
on
cheek
and
jaw
or
peered
forth
from
lately
blackened
eyes
and
these
boyd
noticed
invariably
fawned
upon
big
george
or
treated
him
with
elephantine
playfulness
winking
swollen
lids
at
him
in
a
mysterious
understanding
which
puzzled
the
young
man
until
he
saw
that
balt
himself
bore
similar
signs
of
strife
the
big
man
lips
were
cut
while
back
of
one
ear
a
knot
had
sprung
up
over
night
like
a
fungus
they
fell
to
work
quickly
stripping
themselves
to
their
undershirts
they
manned
the
hoists
seized
trucks
and
and
began
their
tasks
with
a
thoroughly
energy
some
of
them
were
still
so
drunk
that
they
staggered
their
awkwardness
affording
huge
sport
to
their
companions
yet
even
in
their
intoxication
they
were
surprisingly
capable
there
was
a
great
deal
of
laughter
and
disorder
on
every
hand
and
all
made
frequent
trips
to
the
returning
adrip
to
the
waist
their
hair
and
beards
bejewelled
with
drops
boyd
saw
one
a
fellow
in
a
checked
suit
remove
his
clothes
and
hang
them
carefully
upon
a
nail
then
painfully
unlace
his
shoes
after
which
regardless
of
the
litter
under
foot
and
the
splinters
in
the
floor
he
tramped
about
in
bare
feet
and
red
underwear
without
exception
they
seemed
possessed
by
the
spirit
of
boys
at
play
having
seen
them
well
under
way
and
the
winches
working
george
sought
out
boyd
and
proudly
inquired
what
do
you
think
of
them
eh
they
are
splendid
but
where
are
the
others
well
there
are
two
or
three
that
wo
be
able
to
get
around
at
all
he
meditatively
stroked
the
knuckles
of
his
right
hand
which
were
badly
bruised
but
the
balance
will
be
here
these
are
just
the
ones
the
family
men
you
might
say
the
others
will
show
up
gradual
you
see
if
there
had
been
any
fighting
going
on
here
i
have
got
most
of
them
right
off
the
bat
but
there
was
any
inducement
to
offer
except
hard
work
so
they
was
quite
so
anxious
to
commence
humph
there
ought
to
be
enough
excitement
before
long
to
satisfy
any
one
said
boyd
with
a
trace
of
worry
in
his
voice
as
sure
as
you
a
foot
high
exclaimed
george
hopefully
it
the
only
way
we
get
that
ship
loaded
on
time
all
we
need
is
a
riot
or
two
a
man
passed
them
trundling
a
heavy
truck
but
seeing
big
george
he
paused
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
face
then
grinned
and
winked
fraternally
hey
if
this
work
is
too
heavy
for
you
why
do
you
quit
growled
balt
but
strangely
enough
the
fellow
took
no
offence
instead
he
closed
his
swollen
eye
for
a
second
time
then
spat
upon
his
hands
and
as
he
struggled
with
his
burden
grunted
pleasantly
i
pretty
near
got
you
georgie
if
you
had
ducked
we
been
at
it
yet
eh
balt
smiled
in
turn
then
gingerly
felt
of
the
knob
behind
his
ear
did
you
have
a
fight
with
him
queried
emerson
not
exactly
a
fight
but
he
put
this
nubbin
on
my
conch
answered
the
fisherman
he
a
tough
proposition
one
of
the
best
we
got
what
was
the
trouble
nothing
i
used
to
have
to
lick
him
every
year
we
sort
of
missed
each
other
lately
then
you
were
merely
renewing
a
pleasant
acquaintance
laughed
the
younger
man
he
hit
you
in
the
mouth
too
i
see
no
i
got
that
from
a
stranger
i
was
bedding
him
down
when
he
kicked
me
with
his
boot
he
ai
here
this
morning
if
i
were
you
i
go
up
to
the
hotel
and
get
some
sleep
boyd
advised
i
oversee
things
george
hesitated
i
do
know
if
i
better
go
or
not
they
all
got
and
they
liable
to
out
any
minute
if
you
watch
them
they
ai
vicious
understand
they
just
like
to
frolic
around
i
watch
them
after
a
contemplative
glance
at
his
companion
figure
balt
gave
in
with
the
final
caution
do
let
them
get
the
upper
hand
or
there
wo
be
no
living
with
them
after
his
departure
boyd
was
not
long
in
learning
the
cause
of
his
hesitancy
for
no
sooner
did
the
men
realize
the
change
in
authority
over
them
than
they
undertook
to
feel
out
the
mettle
of
their
new
foreman
directly
one
of
them
approached
him
with
the
demand
get
us
a
drink
boss
we
thirsty
there
is
the
said
emerson
help
yourself
go
on
we
do
want
water
rustle
up
a
keg
of
beer
will
you
nothing
doing
he
turned
back
to
his
task
but
a
moment
later
boyd
saw
him
making
for
the
shore
end
of
the
dock
and
with
a
few
strides
placed
himself
in
his
path
where
are
you
going
after
a
drink
of
course
you
want
to
quit
eh
the
man
eyed
him
for
an
instant
then
answered
no
the
job
all
right
but
i
thirsty
those
working
near
ceased
their
labors
and
gathered
around
whereupon
their
companion
addressed
them
say
it
a
great
note
when
a
fellow
ca
have
a
drink
come
on
boys
i
set
up
there
was
a
general
laugh
and
a
forward
movement
of
all
within
hearing
which
boyd
checked
with
a
rough
command
get
back
to
work
all
of
you
but
the
spokesman
disregarding
his
words
attempted
to
pass
whereupon
without
warning
boyd
knocked
him
down
with
a
clean
blow
to
the
face
at
this
the
others
yelled
and
rushed
forward
only
to
be
met
by
their
foreman
who
had
snatched
a
it
was
an
ugly
weapon
and
he
used
it
so
viciously
that
they
quickly
gave
him
room
now
get
to
work
he
ordered
quietly
you
can
quit
if
you
want
to
but
i
lay
out
the
first
fellow
that
goes
after
a
drink
make
up
your
minds
what
you
want
to
do
quick
there
was
a
moment
hesitation
and
then
with
the
absurd
vagary
of
a
crowd
they
broke
into
loud
laughter
and
slouched
back
to
work
two
of
them
dragging
the
cause
of
the
outburst
to
the
where
they
held
his
head
under
the
stream
until
he
began
to
sputter
and
squirm
before
those
at
the
gangway
had
noticed
the
disturbance
it
was
all
over
and
thereafter
boyd
experienced
no
trouble
on
the
contrary
they
worked
the
better
for
his
proof
of
authority
and
took
him
into
their
fellowship
as
if
he
had
qualified
to
their
entire
satisfaction
even
the
man
he
had
struck
seemed
to
share
in
the
general
respect
rather
than
to
cherish
the
least
the
respite
was
brief
however
for
the
work
had
not
continued
many
hours
before
a
stranger
made
his
way
quietly
in
upon
the
dock
and
began
to
argue
with
the
first
fisherman
he
met
boyd
discovered
him
quickly
and
approaching
him
demanded
what
do
you
want
nothing
said
the
then
get
out
what
for
i
just
talking
to
this
man
i
ca
allow
any
talking
here
hurry
up
and
get
out
this
is
a
free
country
i
ai
hurting
you
will
you
go
say
you
ca
load
that
cargo
this
way
the
man
began
threateningly
and
you
ca
make
me
go
at
which
emerson
seized
him
by
the
collar
and
quickly
disproved
the
assertion
to
the
great
delight
of
the
fishermen
he
marched
his
prisoner
to
the
dock
entrance
and
thrust
him
out
into
the
street
with
the
warning
do
you
let
me
catch
you
in
here
again
i
a
union
man
and
you
ca
load
that
ship
with
the
stranger
swore
as
he
slunk
off
you
be
sorry
for
this
but
boyd
motioned
him
away
and
summoned
two
of
his
men
to
stand
guard
with
him
all
that
morning
the
three
held
their
posts
refusing
to
admit
any
one
who
did
not
have
business
within
the
while
a
considerable
crowd
assembled
in
the
street
the
first
actual
violence
however
occurred
when
the
fishermen
knocked
off
for
the
noon
hour
sensing
the
storm
about
to
break
boyd
called
up
the
police
department
from
the
then
summoned
big
george
who
appeared
in
quick
time
it
was
with
considerable
difficulty
that
the
crew
fought
its
way
back
to
resume
work
at
one
during
the
afternoon
the
strikers
made
several
attempts
to
enter
the
and
it
required
a
firm
stand
by
the
guards
to
restrain
them
these
growing
signs
of
excitement
pleased
the
fishermen
intensely
and
at
each
advance
of
the
crowd
it
became
as
great
a
task
to
hold
them
back
as
it
was
to
check
the
union
forces
during
one
of
these
disturbances
captain
peasley
made
his
way
shoreward
from
the
ship
to
scan
the
scene
and
the
sight
of
his
uniform
excited
the
ire
of
the
strikers
afresh
after
a
glance
over
the
mob
he
remarked
to
emerson
it
looks
like
a
bloody
riot
already
does
it
four
hundred
pounds
to
those
dock
wallopers
huh
you
know
if
i
allowed
them
to
bleed
me
that
way
at
that
instant
from
some
quarter
a
railroad
spike
whizzed
past
the
captain
head
banging
against
the
boards
behind
him
with
such
a
thump
that
the
dignified
englishman
ducked
quickly
amid
a
shout
of
derision
he
began
to
curse
them
roundly
in
his
own
particular
style
you
better
keep
under
cover
captain
advised
emerson
they
seem
to
care
for
you
so
it
would
appear
he
agreed
they
getting
nawsty
are
they
i
hope
it
does
lawst
well
i
hope
it
does
said
george
balt
if
they
only
keep
at
it
and
beat
up
some
of
our
boys
at
the
whole
gang
will
be
here
in
the
morning
it
seemed
that
his
wishes
bade
fair
to
be
realized
for
as
the
day
wore
on
instead
of
diminishing
the
excitement
increased
by
evening
it
became
so
menacing
that
boyd
was
forced
to
send
in
an
urgent
demand
for
a
squadron
of
bluecoats
to
escort
his
men
to
their
lodgings
and
it
was
only
by
the
most
vigorous
efforts
that
a
serious
clash
was
averted
nor
was
this
task
the
easier
since
it
did
not
meet
with
the
approval
of
the
fishermen
themselves
who
keenly
resented
protection
of
any
sort
true
to
george
prediction
the
next
morning
found
the
non
union
men
out
in
such
force
that
they
were
divided
into
a
night
and
a
day
crew
half
of
them
being
sent
back
to
report
later
while
among
the
mountains
of
freight
the
work
went
forward
faster
than
ever
but
the
night
had
served
to
point
the
anger
of
the
strikers
and
the
dock
owners
becoming
alarmed
for
the
safety
of
their
property
joined
with
emerson
in
establishing
a
force
of
a
dozen
guards
armed
with
clubs
to
assist
the
police
in
disputing
the
shore
line
with
the
rioters
the
police
themselves
had
proved
ineffective
even
betraying
a
sympathy
with
the
union
men
who
were
not
slow
to
profit
by
it
even
so
the
day
passed
rather
quietly
as
did
the
next
but
in
time
the
agitation
became
so
general
as
to
paralyze
a
wide
section
of
the
and
the
city
awoke
to
the
realization
that
a
serious
conflict
was
in
progress
the
handful
of
fishermen
hidden
under
the
roof
of
the
great
warehouse
outnumbered
twenty
to
one
and
guarded
only
by
a
thin
line
of
pickets
became
a
centre
of
general
interest
as
the
violence
of
the
mob
stimulated
rather
than
checked
by
the
indifference
of
the
police
became
more
openly
daring
so
likewise
did
the
reprisals
of
the
fishermen
goaded
now
to
a
stubborn
rage
they
would
not
hear
to
having
their
food
brought
to
them
but
insisted
daily
on
emerging
in
a
body
at
noon
and
spending
the
hour
in
combat
not
to
speak
of
the
physical
disabilities
they
incurred
in
these
affrays
the
excitement
distracted
them
and
affected
their
work
disastrously
to
the
great
concern
of
their
employer
it
was
on
the
fourth
day
that
boyd
espied
the
man
in
the
gray
suit
among
the
strikers
and
pointed
him
out
to
his
three
companions
clyde
and
fraser
having
joined
him
and
george
in
a
spirit
of
curiosity
clyde
was
for
immediately
executing
a
sally
to
capture
the
fellow
explaining
that
once
they
had
him
inside
the
they
could
beat
him
until
he
confessed
that
marsh
was
behind
the
strike
but
his
valor
shrank
amazingly
when
fraser
maliciously
suggested
that
he
himself
lead
the
dash
no
he
exclaimed
i
not
a
fighting
man
but
i
a
good
general
you
know
napoleon
was
about
my
size
i
never
noticed
the
resemblance
remarked
fraser
all
the
same
your
idea
ai
so
bad
said
balt
there
somebody
stirring
those
fellows
up
and
i
think
it
that
detective
i
mind
getting
my
hands
on
him
and
if
you
all
stick
with
me
i
go
out
after
him
not
for
mine
hastily
declared
fingerless
fraser
i
do
want
to
fight
anybody
i
here
as
a
spectator
you
not
afraid
questioned
emerson
not
exactly
afraid
but
what
the
use
of
my
getting
mixed
up
in
this
row
it
ai
cannery
now
while
a
mob
is
by
nature
noisy
and
threatening
there
is
little
real
danger
in
it
until
its
diffusive
violence
is
directed
into
one
channel
by
a
leader
then
indeed
it
becomes
a
terrible
thing
and
to
the
watchers
at
the
dock
it
became
evident
in
time
that
a
guiding
influence
was
at
work
among
their
enemies
sure
enough
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
fourth
day
without
a
moment
warning
the
strikers
rushed
in
a
body
bearing
down
the
guards
like
reeds
they
came
so
unexpectedly
that
there
was
no
time
to
muster
reinforcements
at
the
gate
almost
before
the
fishermen
could
drop
their
tasks
their
enemies
were
inside
the
building
and
pandemonium
had
broken
loose
the
structure
rocked
to
the
tumult
of
pounding
heels
of
yells
and
imprecations
the
lofty
roof
serving
to
toss
back
and
magnify
the
uproar
emerson
and
his
companions
found
themselves
carried
away
before
the
onslaught
like
chips
in
the
surf
then
sucked
into
a
maelstrom
where
the
first
duty
was
behind
locked
doors
and
shivering
glass
a
terrified
receiver
to
ear
was
calling
madly
for
police
headquarters
while
in
the
main
building
itself
the
crowd
bellowed
and
roared
and
the
hollow
floor
reverberated
to
the
thunder
of
trampling
feet
and
the
crash
of
tumbling
boyd
succeeded
in
keeping
his
footing
and
eventually
fought
his
way
to
a
backing
of
crated
machinery
where
he
stooped
and
ripped
a
cleat
loose
then
laying
about
him
with
this
weapon
he
cleared
a
space
it
was
already
difficult
to
distinguish
friend
from
foe
but
he
saw
alton
clyde
go
down
a
short
distance
away
and
made
a
rush
to
rescue
him
his
pine
slat
splintered
against
a
head
he
dodged
a
missile
then
struck
with
the
fragment
in
his
hand
and
snatching
clyde
by
the
arm
dragged
him
out
from
under
foot
battered
and
bruised
the
two
won
back
to
emerson
first
position
and
watched
the
tide
surge
past
at
the
first
alarm
the
fishermen
had
armed
themselves
with
and
bludgeons
and
for
a
time
worked
havoc
among
their
assailants
but
as
the
fight
became
more
general
they
were
forced
apart
and
drawn
into
the
crowd
whereupon
the
combatants
split
up
into
groups
milling
about
like
frightened
cattle
men
broke
out
from
these
struggling
clusters
to
nurse
their
injuries
or
beat
a
retreat
only
to
be
overrun
and
swallowed
up
again
in
a
new
commotion
emerson
saw
the
big
barefooted
fisherman
in
the
red
underclothes
armed
with
a
go
through
the
ranks
of
his
enemies
like
a
tornado
only
to
be
struck
by
some
missile
hurled
from
a
distance
with
a
shout
of
rage
the
fellow
turned
and
flung
his
own
weapon
at
his
assailant
felling
him
like
an
ox
then
he
in
turn
was
blotted
out
by
a
surge
of
rioters
but
there
was
little
time
for
observation
as
the
scene
was
changing
with
kaleidoscopic
rapidity
and
there
was
the
necessity
of
seeing
clyde
helpless
condition
emerson
shouted
come
on
i
help
you
aboard
the
ship
he
found
a
hardwood
club
beneath
his
feet
one
of
those
cudgels
that
are
used
in
pounding
and
hawsers
and
with
it
cleared
a
pathway
for
clyde
and
himself
but
while
still
at
a
distance
from
the
ship
gangway
he
suddenly
spied
the
man
in
the
gray
suit
who
had
climbed
upon
one
of
the
whence
he
was
scanning
the
crowd
the
man
likewise
recognized
emerson
and
pointed
him
out
crying
something
unintelligible
in
the
tumult
then
leaped
down
from
his
the
next
instant
boyd
saw
him
approaching
followed
by
several
others
he
endeavored
to
hustle
clyde
to
the
big
doors
ahead
of
the
oncomers
but
being
intercepted
backed
against
the
shed
wall
barely
in
time
to
beat
off
the
foremost
his
nearest
assailant
had
armed
himself
with
an
iron
bar
and
endeavored
to
guard
the
first
blow
with
this
instrument
but
it
flew
from
his
grasp
and
he
sustained
the
main
force
of
the
impact
on
his
forearm
then
though
boyd
fell
back
farther
the
others
rushed
in
and
he
found
himself
hard
beset
what
happened
thereafter
neither
he
nor
alton
clyde
who
was
to
begin
with
ever
clearly
remembered
for
in
such
instants
the
mental
photograph
is
wont
to
be
either
unusually
distinct
or
else
fogged
to
such
a
blur
that
only
the
stand
out
clearly
in
retrospect
before
he
had
recognized
the
personal
nature
of
the
assault
emerson
found
himself
engaged
in
a
furious
struggle
where
a
want
of
room
hampered
the
free
use
of
his
cudgel
and
he
was
forced
to
rely
mainly
upon
his
fists
blows
were
rained
upon
him
from
unguarded
quarters
he
was
kicked
battered
and
flung
about
his
blind
instinct
finally
leading
him
to
clinch
with
whomsoever
his
hands
encountered
then
a
sudden
blackness
swallowed
him
up
after
which
he
found
himself
upon
his
knees
his
arms
loosely
encircling
a
pair
of
legs
and
realized
that
he
had
been
by
a
blow
from
behind
the
legs
he
was
clutching
tried
to
kick
him
loose
at
which
he
summoned
all
his
strength
knowing
that
he
must
go
down
no
further
but
as
he
struggled
upward
something
smote
him
in
the
side
with
sickening
force
and
he
went
to
his
knees
again
close
beside
him
he
saw
the
club
he
had
dropped
and
endeavored
to
reach
it
but
before
he
could
do
so
a
hand
snatched
it
away
and
he
heard
a
voice
cursing
above
him
a
second
time
he
tried
to
rise
but
his
shocked
nerves
failed
to
transmit
the
impulse
to
his
muscles
he
could
only
raise
his
shoulder
and
fling
an
arm
weakly
above
his
head
in
anticipation
of
the
crushing
blow
he
knew
was
coming
but
it
did
not
descend
instead
he
heard
a
gun
shot
that
sound
for
which
his
ears
had
been
strained
from
the
first
and
then
for
an
instant
he
wondered
if
it
had
been
directed
at
himself
a
weight
sank
across
his
calves
the
legs
he
had
been
holding
broke
away
from
his
grasp
then
with
a
final
effort
he
pulled
himself
free
and
staggered
to
his
feet
his
head
rocking
his
knees
sagging
he
saw
a
man
figure
facing
him
and
lunged
at
it
to
bring
up
in
the
arms
of
fingerless
fraser
who
cried
sharply
are
you
hurt
bo
too
dazed
to
answer
he
turned
and
beheld
the
body
of
a
man
stretched
face
downward
on
the
floor
beyond
the
fellow
in
the
gray
suit
was
disappearing
into
the
crowd
even
yet
boyd
did
not
realize
whence
the
shot
had
come
although
the
smell
of
powder
was
sharp
in
his
nostrils
then
he
saw
a
gleam
of
blue
metal
in
fraser
hands
give
me
that
gun
he
panted
but
his
deliverer
held
him
off
i
may
need
it
myself

i

got
but
the
one
here
let
get
clyde
out
of
this
stepping
over
the
motionless
form
at
his
feet
fraser
lifted
the
young
who
was
huddled
in
a
formless
heap
as
if
he
had
fallen
from
a
great
height
and
together
the
two
dragged
him
toward
bedford
as
they
went
aboard
they
were
nearly
run
down
by
a
body
of
reinforcements
that
captain
peasley
had
finally
mustered
from
between
decks
down
the
and
over
the
side
they
poured
grimy
stokers
greasy
oilers
and
swearing
deckhands
equipped
with
wrenches
and
without
waiting
to
observe
the
effect
of
these
boyd
and
fraser
bundled
alton
into
the
first
cabin
at

then
turned
back

here
and
look
after

was
away
on
the
instant
with
boyd
staggering
after
him
still
weak
and
shaking
the
vague
discomfort
of
running
blood
at
the
back
of
his
neck
muttering
thickly
as
he
went
give
me
your
gun
fraser
give
me
your

the
battle
was
still
raging
when
the
police
arrived
after
an
interminable
delay
and
it
ceased
only
at
the
rough
play
of
and
after
repeated
charges
of
the
uniformed
men
had
broken
up
the
ranks
of
the
strikers
the
dock
was
cleared
at
length
and
of
bleeding
struggling
combatants
rolled
away
to
jail
union
and
men
bundled
in
together
but
work
was
not
resumed
that
day
despite
the
fact
that
big
george
bruised
ragged
and
torn
doubled
his
force
of
pickets
and
took
personal
charge
of
them
that
night
under
glaring
headlines
the
evening

dead
of

the

for

working
as
they

with

and
under
constant
guard
riot
was
in

on

side
by
the

whose
apathy
disappeared
only
when
an
opportunity
occurred
of
arresting
the
men
they
were
supposed
to
protect
they
were
more
handicapped
than
helped
the
appearance
of
a
fisherman
at
any
point
along
the
became
a
sure
signal
for
strife
day
by
day
the
feeling
on
both
sides
grew
stronger
till
the
men
were
cemented
together
in
a
spirit
of
bitterest
indignation
which
materially
lessened
their
zeal
for
work
every
act
of
violence
intensified
their
rage
they
armed
themselves
in
defiance
of
orders
tossed
restraint
to
the
winds
and
sought
the
slightest
opportunity
of
wreaking

it
became
necessary
to
guard
all
property
in
the
warehouse
districts
and
men
ceased
to
venture
there
alone
after
dark
one
circumstance
caused
boyd
no
little
surprise
and
uneasiness
the
fact
that
no
vigorous
effort
had
been
made
to
fix
the
blame
for
the
striker
death
on
that
riotous
afternoon
surely
he
reasoned
detective
must
have
witnessed
the
killing
and
must
recognize
the
ease
with
which
the
act
could
now
be
saddled
upon
him
if
delay
were
their
object
emerson
could
not
understand
why
they
did
not
seek
to
have
him
arrested
the
consequences
might
well
be
serious
if
marsh
money
were
used
but
as
the
days
slipped
past
and
nothing
occurred
he
decided
that
he
had
been
overfearful
on
this
score
or
else
that
the
manager
of
the
packers
trust
had
limits
beyond
which
he
would
not
push
his
persecution
a
from

peasley
ship
the
rival
company
tenders
were
loading
rapidly
with
union
labor
and
it
seemed
that
in
spite
of
plan
to
be
first
at
kalvik
marsh
force
would
beat
him
to
the
ground
unless
greater
efforts
were
made
when
he
communicated
these
fears
to
big
george
the
fisherman
suddenly
became
a
he
passed
among
his
men
cajoling
threatening
bribing
and
they
began
to
work
like
demons
with
the
result
that
when
the
twentieth
arrived
he
was
able
to
announce
to
his
partner
that
the
work
would
be
finished
some
time
during
the
following
morning
the
next
day
emerson
and
clyde
drove
down
to
the
dock
with
cherry
in
a
closed
carriage
experiencing
no
annoyance
beyond
some
jeers
and
insults
as
they
passed
through
the
picket
line
boyd
had
barely
seen
them
comfortably
established
on
board
when
up
the
ship
gangway
came
fingerless
fraser
radiantly
attired
three
heavily
laden
hotel
porters
groaning
at
his
back
the
customary
cigar
between
his
teeth
are
you
going
with
us
boyd
inquired
sure
see
here
is
life
one
long
succession
of
surprise
parties
with
you
why
i
figgered
on
this
right
along
but
the
ship
is
jammed
now
there
is
no
room
oh
i
fixed
that
up
long
ago
i
am
going
to
bunk
with
the
steward
well
why
in
the
world
did
you
let
us
know
you
were
coming
say
do
kid
yourself
you
knew
i
could
stay
behind
fraser
blew
a
cloud
of
smoke
airily
i
never
start
anything
i
ca
finish
i
keep
telling
you
and
i
going
to
put
this
deal
through
now
that
i
got
it
started
with
a
laugh
and
a
complete
change
of
manner
he
laid
his
hand
upon
boyd
shoulder
saying
pal
i
much
good
to
myself
or
anybody
else
but
i
like
you
and
i
want
to
stick
around
maybe
i
come
in
useful
yet
you
ca
tell
emerson
had
never
glimpsed
this
side
of
the
man
nature
and
it
rather
surprised
him
of
course
you
can
come
along
old
man
he
responded
heartily
glad
to
have
you
to
one
who
has
never
witnessed
the
spring
sailing
of
a
northern
the
event
is
well
worth
seeing
it
is
one
of
the
curiosities
of
the
seattle
not
only
is
there
the
inevitable
confusion
involved
in
the
departure
of
an
overloaded
craft
but
likewise
there
is
all
the
noisy
excitement
that
attends
a
shipment
of
oriental
troops
the
chinese
maintain
such
a
clatter
as
to
drown
the
hoarse
cries
of
the
stevedores
the
complaint
of
the
creaking
tackle
and
the
rumble
of
the
winches
they
scurry
hither
and
yon
like
a
distracted
army
forever
in
the
way
shouting
clacking
squealing
in
senseless
turmoil
they
are
timid
as
to
the
water
and
for
them
a
voyage
is
at
all
times
beset
with
many
alarms
it
is
no
more
possible
to
restrain
them
than
to
calm
a
frightened
herd
of
wild
pigs
nor
will
they
embark
at
all
until
their
frenzy
has
run
its
course
and
died
of
its
own
exhaustion
to
discipline
them
according
to
the
seamen
standard
is
inadvisable
for
many
of
them
are
cutters
big
evil
fellows
whose
trade
it
is
to
butcher
and
in
whose
dextrous
hands
a
knife
becomes
a
frightful
weapon
the
japs
ordinarily
so
noiseless
and
submissive
yield
to
the
contagion
and
add
their
share
to
the
uproar
each
man
carries
a
few
pounds
of
baggage
in
bundles
or
packs
or
valises
and
these
scanty
belongings
he
guards
with
shrieking
solicitude
while
the
pandemonium
of
the
orientals
who
gathered
to
board
bedford
was
sufficient
in
itself
to
cause
consternation
it
was
as
nothing
to
that
which
broke
loose
when
the
fishermen
began
to
assemble
to
a
man
they
were
drunk
belligerent
and
declamatory
a
few
to
be
sure
were
still
busy
with
the
tag
ends
of
the
cargo
but
the
majority
had
gone
to
their
lodgings
for
their
packs
and
now
reappeared
in
a
state
of
the
wildest
exuberance
for
this
would
be
their
last
spree
of
the
season
and
before
them
lay
a
period
of
long
sleepless
nights
exposure
and
unceasing
labor
wherein
a
year
work
must
be
crowded
into
three
months
they
therefore
inaugurated
the
change
in
befitting
style
on
the
whole
no
explosive
has
ever
been
invented
that
is
so
noisy
in
its
effect
so
furiously
expansive
in
its
action
as
the
fumes
of
cheap
whiskey
the
great
soon
began
to
reverberate
to
the
wildest
clamor
which
added
to
the
fury
of
the
crowd
outside
the
strikers
unable
to
enter
the
building
flowed
down
upon
the
adjoining
wharf
or
clambered
to
the
roofs
nearby
whence
they
jeered
insultingly
among
them
was
a
newspaper
photographer
bent
on
securing
an
unusual
picture
for
his
publication
and
in
truth
the
scene
from
this
point
of
view
was
sufficiently
novel
and
striking
the
decks
of
the
big
tramp
steamer
were
piled
high
with
gear
of
every
description
a
trio
of
stout
were
blocked
up
amidships
long
piles
of
lumber
rose
higher
than
a
man
head
and
the
roofs
of
the
were
jammed
with
nested
one
inside
the
other
like
pots
in
a
kitchen
every
available
inch
was
crowded
with
cases
of
gasoline
of
groceries
and
of
the
varied
provisions
required
on
an
expedition
of
this
magnitude
aft
on
rows
of
hooks
were
suspended
the
carcasses
of
sheep
and
bullocks
and
hogs
there
seemed
to
be
nowhere
another
foot
of
available
room
the
red
of
the
ship
was
already
submerged
yet
notwithstanding
this
fact
her
derricks
clanged
noisily
her
booms
swung
back
and
forth
and
her
gaping
hatches
swallowed
momentary
loads
those
fishermen
who
had
come
aboard
early
had
settled
like
flies
in
the
rigging
whence
they
taunted
their
enemies
hurling
back
insult
for
insult
it
was
much
like
the
departure
of
a
gold
steamer
during
the
early
famine
stages
of
the
northward
stampede
save
that
now
there
were
no
women
while
the
confusion
was
immeasurably
greater
and
through
it
all
might
be
felt
a
certain
strained
and
angry
menace
all
the
long
afternoon
bedford
lay
at
her
moorings
subjected
to
the
customary
delays
as
the
time
dragged
on
and
the
liquor
died
in
the
fishermen
it
became
a
herculean
task
to
prevent
them
from
issuing
forth
into
the
street
while
the
crowds
outside
seemed
possessed
of
a
desperate
determination
to
force
an
entrance
and
bring
the
issue
to
a
final
settlement
but
across
the
shore
end
of
the
dock
a
double
cordon
was
drawn
which
hurled
back
the
intruders
at
every
advance
the
fishermen
who
remained
inside
the
barnlike
structure
unable
to
come
at
their
enemies
fought
among
themselves
bidding
fair
to
wreck
the
building
in
the
extravagance
of
their
delirium
while
outside
the
rival
faction
kept
up
a
fire
of
missiles
and
execrations
as
the
hours
crept
onward
the
tension
increased
and
at
last
boyd
turned
to
captain
peasley
saying
you
better
be
ready
to
pull
out
at
any
minute
for
if
the
mob
breaks
in
we
never
be
able
to
hold
these
maniacs
he
pointed
to
the
black
swarm
aloft
whence
issued
hoarse
waves
of
sound
i
do
like
the
look
of
things
a
little
bit
they
are
a
trifle
strained
to
be
sure
the
captain
acknowledged
i
stand
by
to
cast
off
at
your
signal
so
you
better
pass
the
word
around
boyd
left
the
ship
and
went
to
the
for
there
still
remained
one
thing
to
be
done
he
could
not
leave
without
sounding
a
final
note
of
triumph
for
mildred
how
sweet
it
would
be
to
her
ears
he
knew
full
well
yet
he
could
not
help
wondering
if
she
would
feel
the
thrill
that
mastered
him
at
this
moment
as
he
saw
the
empty
spaces
where
had
stood
those
masses
of
freight
which
he
had
gathered
at
such
cost
as
he
heard
his
own
men
bellowing
defiance
at
his
enemies
and
realized
that
his
first
long
stride
toward
success
had
been
taken
his
heart
swelled
with
gladness
and
the
breath
caught
momentarily
in
his
throat
after
all
he
was
going
to
win
out
of
the
shimmering
distance
of
his
desire
the
lady
of
his
dreams
drew
closer
to
him
and
ere
long
he
could
lay
at
her
feet
the
burden
of
his
travail
and
then
oblivious
to
the
turmoil
all
about
he
wrote
rapidly
almost
incoherently
to
mildred
transcribing
the
mood
of
mingled
tenderness
and
exultation
which
possessed
him
outside
the
building
he
concluded
there
is
a
raging
mob
they
would
ruin
me
if
they
could
but
they
ca
do
it
they
ca
do
it
we
have
beaten
them
all
my
lady
we
have
won
he
was
sealing
his
letter
when
without
warning
fingerless
fraser
appeared
at
his
side
his
fishlike
eyes
agleam
his
colorless
face
drawn
with
anxiety
they
come
to
grab
you
for
killing
that
striker
he
began
breathlessly
there
a
couple
of
on
the
dock
now
better
take
it
on
the
quick
god
so
marsh
had
withheld
this
stroke
until
the
last
moment
when
the
least
delay
would
be
fatal
boyd
knew
that
if
he
were
brought
into
court
he
would
have
hard
shift
to
clear
himself
against
the
mass
of
perjured
testimony
that
his
rival
had
doubtless
gathered
but
even
this
seemed
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
main
issue
for
one
wild
instant
he
considered
sending
george
balt
on
with
the
ship
that
would
be
folly
no
doubt
yet
plainly
he
could
not
hold
bedford
and
keep
together
that
raging
army
of
fishermen
while
he
fought
his
way
through
the
tedious
vexations
of
a
trial
he
saw
that
he
had
his
enemy
cunning
and
he
realized
that
if
marsh
had
planned
this
move
he
would
press
his
advantage
to
the
full
there
two
men
he
heard
fraser
running
on
i
as
they
were
talking
to
peasley
you
better
it
quick
how
i
could
get
through
that
crowd
they
know
me
listen
outside
the
street
broke
into
a
roar
at
some
taunt
of
the
fishermen
high
up
in
the
rigging
i
ca
run
away
and
if
those
detectives
get
me
ruined
well
what
to
be
done
demanded
fraser
sharply
if
you
say
the
word
we
shoot
it
out
with
them
and
get
away
on
the
ship
before
we
ca
do
that
there
are
a
dozen
policemen
in
front
here
well
you
have
to
move
quick
or
they
you
sure
boyd
clinched
his
hands
in
desperation
i
guess
they
got
me
he
said
bitterly
there
no
way
out
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
letter
containing
his
boastful
assurance
of
victory
what
a
mockery
from
what
they
said
i
do
think
they
know
you
fraser
continued
anyhow
they
wanted
peasley
to
point
you
out
when
they
come
off
maybe
you
can
slip
but
how
boyd
seized
eagerly
upon
the
suggestion
the
wharf
is
empty
see
i
have
to
cross
it
in
plain
sight
through
the
rear
door
of
the
office
that
opened
upon
the
dock
proper
they
beheld
the
great
floor
almost
entirely
clear
save
for
a
few
tons
of
freight
at
which
big
george
men
were
working
it
was
as
unobstructed
as
a
lawn
and
although
it
was
nearly
the
size
of
a
city
block
it
afforded
no
more
means
of
concealment
than
did
the
little
office
itself
with
its
glass
doors
its
counter
and
its
long
desk
at
the
farther
end
of
which
a
was
poring
over
his
task
windows
at
the
front
of
the
room
looked
out
upon
the
street
other
windows
and
a
door
at
the
right
opened
upon
the
driveway
and
railroad
track
while
at
the
rear
the
door
through
which
they
had
just
been
peering
gave
egress
only
to
the
dock
itself
up
which
the
two
officers
were
likely
to
come
at
any
instant
even
as
emerson
with
a
last
desperate
glance
summed
up
the
possible
places
of
concealment
fraser
exclaimed
softly
there
they
are
now
and
they
saw
at
the
foot
of
the
two
men
talking
with
big
george
they
saw
balt
point
the
strangers
carelessly
to
the
office
whence
he
had
seen
boyd
disappearing
a
few
moments
before
and
turn
back
to
his
stevedores
then
they
saw
the
men
approaching
here
gim
me
your
coat
and
hat
quick
cried
fraser
in
a
low
voice
his
eyes
blazing
at
a
sudden
thought
he
stripped
his
own
garments
from
his
back
with
feverish
haste
put
mine
on
there
i
stall
for
you
when
they
grab
me
take
it
on
the
run
understand
that
wo
do
everybody
knows
me
boyd
cast
an
apprehensive
glance
at
the
arched
back
of
the
but
fraser
quick
of
resource
in
such
a
situation
forced
him
swiftly
to
make
the
change
saying
nix
it
your
only
stand
here
see
he
indicated
a
position
beside
the
rear
door
i
step
out
the
other
way
where
they
can
see
me
he
continued
pointing
to
the
at
the
right
savvy
when
they
grab
me
you
beat
it
and
do
wait
for
nothing
but
you
already
they
could
hear
the
footsteps
of
the
officers
i
take
a
chance
there
was
no
time
even
for
a
fraser
stepped
swiftly
to
the
door
then
strolled
quietly
out
into
the
view
of
the
two
men
who
an
instant
later
accosted
him
are
you
boyd
emerson
the
adventurer
answered
brusquely
yes
but
i
ca
talk
to
you
now
you
are
under
arrest
mr
emerson
boyd
waited
to
hear
no
more
the
glass
door
swung
open
noiselessly
under
his
hand
and
he
stepped
out
just
as
the
looked
up
from
his
work
staring
out
through
the
other
entrance
fingerless
fraser
voice
was
louder
now
as
if
for
a
signal
arrest
me
what
do
you
mean
get
out
of
my
way
you
better
come
peaceably
boyd
heard
a
sharp
exclamation
get
him
bill
and
then
the
sound
of
men
struggling
he
ran
followed
by
a
roar
from
the
strikers
in
whose
full
view
fraser
encounter
with
the
men
was
taking
place
a
backward
glance
showed
him
that
fraser
had
drawn
his
pursuers
to
the
street
he
had
broken
away
and
dodged
out
into
the
open
where
the
other
officers
responded
at
a
call
and
seized
him
as
he
apparently
undertook
to
break
through
the
cordon
this
diversion
served
an
unexpected
purpose
not
only
did
it
draw
attention
from
retreat
but
it
also
gave
the
mob
its
opportunity
recognizing
in
the
officers
quarry
the
supposed
figure
of
emerson
the
hated
cause
of
all
this
strife
the
strikers
gave
vent
to
a
great
shout
of
rage
and
triumph
and
surged
forward
across
the
wide
street
carrying
the
police
before
them
with
irresistible
force
in
a
moment
it
became
not
a
question
of
keeping
the
entrance
to
the
wharf
but
of
protecting
the
life
of
the
prisoner
and
the
policemen
rallied
with
their
backs
to
the
wall
their
clubs
working
havoc
with
the
heads
that
came
within
striking
distance
scarcely
had
boyd
reached
big
george
when
a
wing
of
the
besieging
army
swept
in
through
the
unguarded
entrance
and
down
the
dock
like
an
avalanche
leaving
behind
them
the
battling
officers
and
the
hungry
pack
clamoring
for
the
prisoner
drop
that
freight
and
get
aboard
the
best
way
you
can
boyd
yelled
at
the
fishermen
and
with
a
bound
was
out
into
the
open
crying
to
captain
peasley
on
the
bridge
here
they
come
cast
off
for
god
sake
instantly
a
wild
cry
of
rage
and
defiance
rose
from
the
clotted
rigging
and
upper
works
of
bedford
down
the
fishermen
swarmed
ready
to
the
sides
of
the
ship
but
with
a
sharp
order
to
george
boyd
ran
up
the
and
rushed
along
the
rail
to
a
commanding
position
in
the
path
of
his
men
where
drawing
his
revolver
he
roared
at
them
to
keep
back
threatening
the
first
to
go
ashore
his
lungs
were
bursting
from
his
sprint
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
his
voice
rose
above
the
turmoil
but
he
presented
such
a
figure
of
determination
that
the
men
paused
and
then
the
steamship
whistle
interrupted
opportunely
with
a
deafening
blast
the
dozen
men
who
had
been
slinging
freight
on
the
dock
hastened
up
the
or
climbed
the
fenders
while
the
clung
to
the
lifting
tackle
and
at
the
piping
cry
of
his
whistle
was
swung
aloft
out
of
the
very
arms
of
the
rioters
above
on
the
flying
bridge
captain
peasley
was
bellowing
orders
a
quartermaster
was
running
up
the
iron
steps
to
the
on
deck
the
sailors
were
fighting
their
way
to
their
posts
through
the
ranks
of
the
raging
fishermen
and
the
shrieking
confusion
of
the
orientals
the
last
men
aboard
with
a
heave
ho
in
unison
slid
the
upward
and
out
of
reach
the
neighboring
roofs
lately
so
black
were
emptying
now
the
onlookers
hastening
to
join
in
the
attack
big
george
alone
remained
upon
the
wharf
as
he
saw
the
rush
coming
he
had
ordered
his
men
to
abandon
their
load
then
he
ran
to
the
and
taking
slack
from
a
deck
hand
cast
it
off
back
up
the
dock
he
went
to
the
forward
hawser
where
at
a
signal
he
did
the
same
moving
toward
the
last
without
excessive
hurry
as
if
in
a
spirit
of
bravado
the
ship
was
clear
and
he
had
not
cut
a
hawser
he
had
done
his
work
all
but
a
ton
or
two
of
the
cargo
was
stowed
there
was
no
longer
cause
for
delay
get
aboard
are
you
mad
emerson
shouted
but
the
cry
never
reached
him
back
he
came
slowly
in
front
of
the
press
secure
in
his
tremendous
strength
defiance
in
his
every
move
a
smouldering
challenge
in
his
eyes
and
noting
that
gigantic
frame
with
its
flaming
face
not
one
of
his
enemies
dared
oppose
him
but
as
he
passed
they
yapped
and
snarled
and
jostled
at
his
heels
hungry
to
rend
him
and
only
lacking
courage
as
yet
the
ship
although
throbbing
to
the
first
pulsations
of
her
engines
lay
snug
along
the
piling
but
gradually
her
stern
swung
off
and
a
wedge
of
clearance
showed
almost
imperceptibly
she
drew
back
and
rubbed
against
the
timbers
a
fender
began
to
squeeze
and
complain
the
dock
planking
creaked
sixty
seconds
more
and
she
would
be
out
of
and
still
george
made
no
haste
again
boyd
shouted
at
him
and
then
with
one
farewell
glower
over
his
shoulder
the
big
fellow
mounted
a
pile
stretched
his
arms
upward
to
the
bulwarks
and
swung
himself
lightly
aboard
even
yet
emerson
anxiety
was
of
the
keenest
for
notwithstanding
the
stress
of
these
dragging
moments
he
had
not
forgotten
fraser
the
vagabond
the
morally
twisted
rascal
to
whose
courage
and
resourcefulness
he
owed
so
much
he
strained
his
eyes
for
a
glimpse
of
the
fellow
at
the
same
time
dreading
the
sight
of
a
uniform
would
the
ship
never
get
under
way
and
out
of
hailing
distance
if
those
officers
had
discovered
their
mistake
they
might
yet
have
time
to
stop
him
he
vowed
desperately
that
he
would
not
let
them
not
if
he
had
to
take
bedford
to
sea
with
a
gun
at
the
back
of
her
helmsman
he
made
his
way
hurriedly
to
the
bridge
where
he
hastily
explained
to
captain
peasley
his
evasion
of
the
officers
and
here
he
found
cherry
her
face
flushed
her
eyes
sparkling
with
excitement
but
far
too
wise
to
speak
to
him
in
his
present
state
of
mind
a
scattered
shower
of
missiles
came
aboard
as
the
strikers
kept
pace
with
the
steamer
to
the
end
of
the
slip
exciting
the
fishermen
who
had
again
mounted
the
rigging
to
a
simian
frenzy
oaths
insults
and
jeers
were
hurled
back
and
forth
but
as
the
big
steamer
gathered
momentum
and
slid
out
of
her
berth
they
grew
gradually
more
indistinct
until
at
last
they
became
muffled
broken
and
meaningless
even
then
the
rival
ranks
continued
to
volley
profanely
at
each
other
while
the
captain
with
hand
on
the
blew
taunting
blasts
nor
did
the
fishermen
descend
from
their
perches
until
the
forms
on
the
dock
had
blurred
together
and
the
city
lay
massed
in
the
distance
tier
upon
tier
against
the
gorgeous
evening
sky
chapter
xix
in
which
a
mutiny
is
threatened
even
after
they
were
miles
down
the
sound
boyd
remained
at
his
post
sweeping
the
waters
astern
in
an
anxious
search
for
some
swift
harbor
craft
the
appearance
of
which
would
signal
that
his
escape
had
been
discovered
i
wo
feel
safe
until
we
are
past
port
townsend
he
confessed
to
cherry
who
maintained
a
position
at
his
side
why
port
townsend
we
do
stop
there
no
but
the
police
can
wire
on
from
seattle
to
stop
us
and
take
me
off
at
that
point
if
they
find
out
their
mistake
they
must
have
found
it
out
long
ago
that
why
i
got
peasley
forcing
this
old
tub
she
doing
ten
knots
and
that
a
breakneck
speed
for
her
once
we
through
the
straits
i
be
satisfied
but
meanwhile
emerson
lowered
his
glasses
with
a
sigh
of
fatigue
and
in
the
soft
twilight
the
girl
saw
that
his
face
was
lined
and
careworn
the
yearning
at
her
heart
lent
poignant
sympathy
to
her
words
as
she
said
you
deserve
to
win
boyd
you
have
made
a
good
fight
oh
i
win
he
declared
wearily
i
got
to
win
only
i
wish
we
were
past
port
townsend
what
will
happen
to
fraser
she
queried
nothing
serious
i
am
sure
you
see
they
wanted
me
and
nobody
else
once
they
find
they
have
the
wrong
man
i
rather
believe
they
will
free
him
in
disgust
a
moment
later
he
went
on
just
the
same
it
makes
me
feel
depressed
and
guilty
to
leave
him
i
i
would
desert
a
comrade
for
anything
if
the
choice
lay
with
me
you
did
quite
right
cherry
warmly
assured
him
you
see
i
am
not
working
for
myself
i
am
doing
this
for
another
it
was
the
girl
turn
to
sigh
softly
while
the
eyes
she
turned
toward
the
west
were
strangely
sad
and
dreamy
to
her
companion
she
seemed
not
at
all
like
the
buoyant
creature
who
had
kindled
his
courage
when
it
was
so
low
the
brave
girl
who
had
stood
so
steadfastly
at
his
shoulder
and
kept
his
hopes
alive
during
these
last
trying
weeks
it
struck
him
suddenly
that
she
had
grown
very
quiet
of
late
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
had
the
leisure
to
notice
it
but
now
when
he
came
to
reflect
on
it
he
remembered
that
she
had
never
seemed
quite
the
same
since
his
interview
with
her
on
that
day
when
hilliard
had
so
unexpectedly
come
to
his
rescue
he
wondered
if
in
reality
this
change
might
not
be
due
to
some
reflected
alteration
in
himself
well
he
could
not
help
it
her
strange
behavior
at
that
time
had
affected
him
more
deeply
than
he
would
have
thought
possible
and
while
he
had
purposely
avoided
thinking
much
about
the
banker
sudden
change
of
front
back
of
his
devout
thankfulness
for
the
miracle
was
a
vague
suspicion
a
curious
feeling
that
made
him
uncomfortable
in
the
girl
presence
he
could
not
repent
his
determination
to
win
at
any
price
yet
he
shrank
with
a
moral
cowardice
which
made
him
inwardly
writhe
from
owning
that
cherry
had
made
the
sacrifice
at
which
clyde
and
the
others
had
hinted
if
it
were
indeed
true
it
placed
him
in
an
intolerable
position
wherein
he
could
express
neither
his
gratitude
nor
his
censure
no
doubt
she
had
read
the
signs
of
his
mental
confusion
and
her
own
delicate
sensibility
had
responded
to
it
they
remained
side
by
side
on
the
bridge
while
the
day
died
amidst
a
wondrous
panoply
of
color
each
busied
with
thoughts
that
might
not
be
spoken
in
their
hearts
emotions
oddly
at
variance
the
sky
ahead
of
them
was
with
gold
as
if
for
a
symbol
interlaid
with
sooty
clouds
in
silhouette
on
either
side
the
mountains
rose
from
penumbral
darkness
to
heights
still
bright
from
the
slanting
radiance
here
and
there
along
the
shadowy
a
light
was
born
the
smell
of
the
salt
sea
was
in
the
air
above
the
rhythmic
pulse
of
the
steamer
rose
the
voices
of
men
singing
between
decks
while
the
parting
waters
at
the
prow
played
a
soft
accompaniment
a
steward
summoned
them
to
supper
but
boyd
refused
saying
he
could
not
eat
and
the
girl
stayed
with
him
while
the
miles
slowly
slipped
past
and
the
night
encompassed
them
two
hours
more
he
told
her
as
the
ship
bell
sounded
then
i
can
eat
and
sleep
and
sing
captain
peasley
was
pacing
the
bridge
when
later
they
breasted
the
glare
of
port
townsend
and
saw
in
the
distance
the
flashing
searchlights
of
the
forts
that
guard
the
straits
they
saw
him
stop
suddenly
and
raise
his
boyd
laid
his
hand
on
arm
presently
the
captain
crossed
to
them
and
said
yonder
seems
to
be
a
launch
making
out
see
i
wonder
what
up
almost
in
their
path
a
tiny
light
was
violently
agitated
by
jove
they
signalling
you
wo
stop
will
you
questioned
emerson
i
do
know
i
am
sure
i
may
have
to
the
two
boats
were
drawing
together
rapidly
and
soon
those
on
the
bridge
heard
the
faint
but
increasing
patter
of
a
gasoline
exhaust
carrying
the
same
speed
as
bedford
the
launch
shortly
came
within
hailing
distance
the
cyclopean
eye
of
the
searchlight
blazed
up
and
the
next
instant
out
from
the
gloom
leaped
a
little
craft
on
the
deck
of
which
a
man
stood
waving
a
lantern
she
held
steadfastly
to
her
course
and
a
voice
floated
up
to
them
ahoy
what
ship
bedford
for
bristol
bay
peasley
shouted
back
the
man
on
the
launch
relinquished
his
lantern
and
using
both
palms
for
a
funnel
cried
more
clearly
now
heave
to
we
want
to
come
aboard
with
an
exclamation
of
impatience
the
commanding
officer
stepped
to
the
telegraph
but
emerson
forestalled
him
wait
they
after
me
captain
it
the
port
townsend
police
and
if
you
let
them
aboard
they
take
me
off
what
makes
you
think
so
demanded
peasley
ask
them
turning
the
skipper
bellowed
down
the
gleaming
electric
pathway
who
are
you
police
we
want
to
come
aboard
what
did
i
tell
you
cried
emerson
once
more
the
captain
shouted
what
do
you
want
one
of
your
passengers
emerson
heave
to
you
passing
us
that
bloody
hard
luck
emerson
i
ca
help
myself
the
captain
declared
but
again
boyd
blocked
him
as
he
started
for
the
telegraph
i
wo
stand
it
sir
it
a
conspiracy
to
ruin
me
but
my
dear
young
man
do
touch
that
instrument
from
the
launch
came
cries
of
growing
vehemence
and
a
startled
murmur
of
voices
rose
from
somewhere
in
the
darkness
of
the
deck
beneath
stand
aside
peasley
ordered
gruffly
but
the
other
held
his
ground
saying
quietly
i
warn
you
i
am
desperate
shall
i
stop
her
sir
the
quartermaster
asked
from
the
shadows
of
the
no
emerson
commanded
sharply
and
in
the
glow
from
the
they
saw
he
had
drawn
his
revolver
while
on
the
instant
up
from
the
void
beneath
heaved
the
massive
figure
of
big
george
balt
a
behemoth
more
colossal
and
threatening
than
ever
in
the
dim
light
rumbling
curses
as
he
came
he
leaped
up
the
steps
wrenched
open
the
door
and
with
one
sweep
of
his
hairy
paw
flung
the
helmsman
from
his
post
panting
keep
her
going
cap
or
i
run
them
down
we
stood
by
you
old
man
emerson
urged
you
stand
by
us
they
make
you
stop
they
ca
come
aboard
the
launch
was
abreast
of
them
now
and
skimming
along
so
close
that
one
might
have
tossed
a
biscuit
aboard
of
her
for
an
instant
captain
peasley
hesitated
then
emerson
saw
the
ends
of
his
bristly
mustache
rise
above
an
expansive
grin
as
he
winked
portentously
but
his
voice
was
convincingly
loud
and
wrathful
as
he
replied
what
do
you
mean
sir
i
have
my
blooming
ship
libelled
for
this
i
make
good
your
losses
emerson
volunteered
quickly
realizing
that
other
ears
were
open
why
it
mutiny
sir
exactly
you
can
say
you
went
out
under
duress
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
stormed
the
skipper
then
more
quietly
but
i
do
seem
to
have
any
choice
in
the
matter
do
i
none
whatever
tell
them
to
go
to
hell
growled
balt
from
the
open
window
above
their
head
a
blasphemous
outcry
floated
up
from
the
launch
while
heads
protruded
from
the
openings
the
faces
white
in
the
slanting
glare
why
do
you
heave
to
demanded
a
voice
peasley
stepped
to
the
end
of
the
bridge
and
called
down
i
stop
my
good
man
they
wo
allow
it
y
know
you
have
to
bloody
well
come
aboard
yourself
then
obedient
to
his
command
the
traced
an
arc
through
the
darkness
and
died
out
leaving
the
little
craft
in
darkness
save
for
its
dim
lantern
unseen
by
the
amazed
quartermaster
who
was
startled
out
of
speech
and
action
emerson
gripped
the
captain
shoulder
and
whispered
his
thanks
while
the
britisher
grumbled
under
his
breath
bli
me
wo
that
labor
crowd
be
hot
they
nearly
bashed
in
my
head
with
that
iron
spike
four
hundred
pounds
my
word
the
sputter
of
the
craft
alongside
was
now
punctuated
by
such
a
volley
of
curses
that
he
raised
his
voice
again
belay
that
chatter
will
you
there
a
lady
aboard
the
police
launch
sheered
off
and
the
sound
of
her
exhaust
grew
rapidly
fainter
and
fainter
but
not
until
it
had
wholly
ceased
did
big
george
give
over
his
post
at
the
wheel
even
then
he
went
down
the
ladder
reluctantly
and
without
a
word
of
thanks
of
explanation
or
of
apology
with
him
this
had
been
but
a
part
of
the
day
work
he
saw
neither
sentiment
nor
humor
in
the
episode
the
clang
of
the
ship
bell
spoke
the
hour
and
taking
cherry
arm
boyd
helped
her
to
the
deck
now
let
eat
something
said
she
yes
he
agreed
relief
and
triumph
in
his
tone
and
drink
something
too
we
drink
to
the
health
of
fraser
to
the
health
of
fraser
he
echoed
we
will
drink
that
standing
a
week
later
after
an
uneventful
voyage
across
a
sea
of
glass
bedford
made
up
through
a
swirling
and
into
the
harbor
of
unalaska
the
soaring
goonies
that
had
followed
them
from
flattery
had
dropped
astern
at
first
sight
of
the
volcanic
headlands
and
now
countless
thousands
of
fled
from
the
ship
path
squattering
away
in
comic
terror
dragging
their
fat
bodies
across
the
sea
as
a
boy
skips
a
flat
rock
it
had
been
captain
peasley
hope
here
at
the
gateway
of
the
misty
sea
to
learn
something
about
the
lay
of
the
big
to
the
northward
but
he
was
disappointed
for
the
season
was
yet
too
young
for
the
and
the
local
hunters
knew
nothing
forced
to
rely
on
luck
and
his
own
skill
he
steamed
out
again
the
next
day
this
time
doubling
back
to
the
eastward
and
laying
a
cautious
course
along
the
second
leg
of
the
journey
once
through
the
ragged
barrier
that
separates
the
north
pacific
from
her
sister
sea
the
dank
breath
of
the
arctic
smote
them
fairly
the
breeze
that
wafted
out
from
the
north
brought
with
it
the
chill
of
limitless
and
the
first
night
found
them
among
the
outposts
of
that
shifting
desert
of
death
which
debouches
out
of
behring
straits
with
the
first
approach
of
autumn
to
retreat
again
only
at
the
coming
of
reluctant
summer
from
the
the
lookout
stared
down
upon
a
white
expanse
that
stretched
beyond
the
horizon
at
dawn
they
began
their
careful
search
feeling
their
way
eastward
through
the
open
lanes
and
tortuous
passages
that
separated
the
floes
now
for
the
northward
set
of
the
fields
to
clear
a
path
before
them
now
stealing
through
some
narrow
lead
that
opened
into
freer
waters
bedford
was
a
steel
hull
whose
sides
opposed
to
the
jaws
of
the
ponderous
masses
would
have
been
crushed
like
an
eggshell
in
a
vise
unlike
a
wooden
ship
the
gentlest
contact
would
have
sprung
her
plates
while
any
considerable
collision
would
have
pierced
her
as
if
she
had
been
built
of
paper
appreciating
to
the
full
the
peril
of
his
slow
advance
captain
peasley
did
all
the
navigating
in
person
but
eventually
they
were
hemmed
in
so
closely
that
for
a
day
and
a
night
they
could
do
nothing
but
drift
with
the
pack
in
time
however
the
winds
opened
a
crevice
through
which
they
retreated
to
follow
the
outer
limits
farther
eastward
until
they
were
balked
again
opposed
to
them
were
the
forces
of
nature
and
they
were
wholly
dependent
upon
her
fickle
favor
it
might
be
a
day
a
week
a
month
before
she
would
let
them
through
and
even
when
the
barrier
began
to
yield
another
ship
a
league
distant
might
profit
by
an
opening
which
to
them
was
barred
for
a
long
dull
period
the
voyagers
lay
as
helpless
as
if
in
while
wandering
herds
of
seals
barked
at
them
or
bands
of
walruses
ceased
their
fishing
and
crept
out
upon
the
to
observe
these
invaders
of
their
peace
when
an
opportunity
at
last
presented
itself
they
threaded
their
way
southward
there
to
try
another
approach
and
another
and
another
until
the
first
of
may
had
come
and
gone
leaving
them
but
little
closer
to
their
goal
than
when
they
first
late
one
evening
they
discerned
smoke
on
the
horizon
and
the
next
morning
light
showed
a
steamship
fast
in
the
ice
a
few
miles
to
the
westward
that
big
george
informed
his
companions
one
of
the
north
american
packers
association
tenders
she
was
loading
when
we
left
seattle
boyd
remarked
it
is
willis
marsh
ship
so
he
must
be
aboard
supplemented
cherry
she
a
wooden
ship
and
built
for
this
business
if
we
do
look
out
he
beat
us
in
after
all
what
good
will
that
do
him
clyde
questioned
the
fish
do
bite
i
mean
run
for
sixty
days
yet
emerson
and
balt
merely
shrugged
to
cherry
malotte
this
had
been
a
voyage
of
dreams
for
once
away
from
land
boyd
had
become
his
real
self
again
that
genial
irrepressible
self
she
had
seen
but
rarely
and
his
manner
had
lost
the
restraint
and
coolness
which
recently
had
disturbed
their
relations
of
necessity
their
cramped
environment
had
thrown
them
much
together
and
their
companionship
had
been
most
pleasant
she
and
boyd
had
spent
long
hours
together
during
which
his
had
rivalled
that
of
alton
clyde
hours
wherein
she
had
come
to
know
him
more
intimately
and
to
feel
that
he
was
growing
to
a
truer
understanding
of
herself
she
realized
beyond
all
doubt
that
for
him
there
was
but
one
woman
in
all
the
world
yet
the
mere
pleasure
of
being
near
him
was
an
anodyne
for
her
secret
distress
womanlike
she
took
what
was
offered
her
and
strove
unceasingly
for
more
two
days
after
sighting
they
raised
another
ship
one
of
the
sailing
fleet
which
they
knew
to
be
hovering
in
the
offing
and
then
on
the
fifth
of
the
month
the
capricious
current
opened
a
way
for
them
slowly
at
first
they
pushed
on
between
the
floes
into
a
vast
area
of
thence
to
a
stretch
as
open
and
placid
as
a
country
the
lookout
pointed
a
path
out
of
this
into
which
they
steamed
coming
at
length
to
clear
water
with
the
low
shores
of
the
mainland
twenty
miles
away
at
sundown
they
anchored
in
the
wide
estuary
of
the
kalvik
river
the
noisy
rumble
of
their
chains
breaking
the
silence
that
for
months
had
lain
like
a
smother
upon
the
port
the
indian
village
gave
sign
of
life
only
in
thin
azure
wisps
of
smoke
that
rose
from
the
dirt
roofs
the
cannery
buildings
stood
as
naked
and
uninviting
as
when
boyd
had
last
seen
them
the
greek
cross
crowning
the
little
white
church
was
gilded
by
the
evening
sun
through
the
glasses
cherry
spied
a
figure
in
the
door
of
her
house
which
she
declared
was
constantine
but
with
commendable
caution
the
big
breed
forebore
to
join
the
fleet
of
kyaks
now
rapidly
mustering
taking
clyde
with
them
she
and
boyd
were
soon
on
their
way
to
the
land
leaving
george
to
begin
discharging
his
cargo
the
long
voyage
that
had
maddened
the
fishermen
was
at
last
at
an
end
and
they
were
eager
to
begin
their
tasks
a
pull
brought
the
ship
boat
to
cherry
landing
where
constantine
and
chakawana
met
them
the
latter
hysterical
with
joy
the
former
showing
his
delight
in
a
rare
display
of
white
teeth
and
a
flow
of
unintelligible
english
even
the
now
fat
from
idleness
greeted
their
mistress
with
a
fierce
clamor
that
dismayed
alton
clyde
to
whom
all
was
utterly
new
and
strange
glory
be
he
exclaimed
they
nothing
but
wolves
wo
they
bite
and
the
house
ai
it
a
hit
why
it
looks
like
a
stage
setting
oh
say
i
for
this
i
getting
rough
and
primitive
and
brutal
already
when
they
passed
from
the
store
with
its
shelves
sadly
naked
now
to
the
cozy
living
quarters
behind
his
enthusiasm
knew
no
bounds
leaving
chakawana
and
her
mistress
to
chatter
and
clack
in
their
patois
he
inspected
the
premises
inside
and
out
peering
into
all
sorts
of
corners
collecting
souvenirs
and
making
friends
with
the
saturnine
breed
cherry
would
not
return
to
the
ship
but
emerson
and
clyde
and
were
rowed
down
to
the
cannery
site
abreast
of
which
lay
bedford
where
they
lingered
until
the
creeping
twilight
forced
them
to
the
boat
again
when
they
reached
the
ship
the
cool
arctic
night
had
descended
but
its
quiet
was
broken
by
the
halting
nimble
of
the
creak
of
tackle
the
cries
of
men
and
the
sounds
of
a
great
activity
baring
his
head
to
the
breezes
boyd
filled
his
lungs
full
of
the
bracing
air
sweet
with
the
flavor
of
spring
vowing
secretly
that
no
music
that
he
had
ever
heard
was
the
equal
of
this
he
turned
his
face
to
the
southward
and
smiled
while
his
thoughts
sped
a
message
of
love
and
hope
into
the
darkness
chapter
xx
wherein
fingerless
fraser
returns
big
george
had
lost
no
time
and
already
the
were
overboard
while
a
raft
of
timber
was
taking
form
alongside
the
ship
as
soon
as
it
was
completed
it
was
loaded
with
crates
and
boxes
and
paraphernalia
of
all
sorts
then
towed
ashore
as
the
tide
served
another
took
its
place
and
another
and
another
all
that
night
the
torches
flared
and
the
decks
drummed
to
a
ceaseless
activity
in
the
morning
boyd
sent
a
squad
of
fishermen
ashore
to
clear
the
ground
for
his
buildings
and
all
day
new
rafts
of
lumber
and
material
helped
to
increase
the
pile
at
the
water
edge
his
early
training
as
an
engineer
now
stood
him
in
good
stead
for
a
thousand
details
demanded
expert
supervision
but
he
was
as
completely
at
home
at
this
work
as
was
big
george
in
his
own
part
of
the
undertaking
and
it
was
not
long
before
order
began
to
emerge
from
what
seemed
a
hopeless
chaos
never
did
men
have
more
willing
hands
to
do
their
bidding
than
did
he
and
george
and
when
a
week
later
with
willis
marsh
on
board
came
to
anchor
the
were
up
and
peopled
while
the
new
site
had
become
a
beehive
of
activity
the
mouth
of
the
kalvik
river
is
several
miles
wide
yet
it
contains
but
a
small
anchorage
suitable
for
ships
the
rest
of
the
harbor
being
underlaid
with
and
over
which
none
but
small
boats
may
pass
and
as
the
canneries
are
distributed
up
and
down
the
stream
for
a
considerable
distance
it
is
necessary
to
transport
all
supplies
to
and
from
the
ships
by
means
of
tugs
and
lighters
owing
to
the
narrowness
of
the
channel
came
to
her
moorings
not
far
from
bedford
to
marsh
already
furious
at
the
trick
the
ice
had
played
him
this
forced
proximity
to
his
rival
brought
home
with
added
irony
the
fact
that
he
had
been
forestalled
while
it
emphasized
his
knowledge
that
henceforth
the
conflict
would
be
carried
on
at
closer
quarters
it
would
be
a
contest
between
two
men
both
determined
to
win
by
fair
means
or
foul
emerson
was
a
youth
striving
like
a
for
the
love
of
a
lady
and
the
glory
of
conquest
but
he
was
also
a
born
fighter
and
in
every
emergency
he
had
shown
himself
as
able
as
his
experienced
opponent
as
marsh
looked
about
and
saw
how
much
boyd
energy
was
accomplishing
he
was
conscious
of
a
slight
disheartenment
still
he
was
on
his
own
ground
he
had
the
advantage
of
superior
force
and
though
he
was
humiliated
by
his
failure
to
throttle
the
hostile
enterprise
in
its
beginning
he
was
by
no
means
at
the
end
of
his
expedients
he
was
curious
to
see
his
rival
in
action
and
he
decided
to
visit
him
and
test
his
temper
it
was
on
the
afternoon
following
his
arrival
that
marsh
after
a
tour
of
inspection
landed
from
his
launch
and
strolled
up
to
where
boyd
emerson
was
at
work
he
was
greeted
courteously
if
a
bit
coolly
and
found
as
on
their
last
meeting
that
his
own
bearing
was
reflected
exactly
in
that
of
boyd
both
men
beneath
the
scant
politeness
of
their
outward
manner
were
aware
that
the
time
for
ceremony
had
passed
here
in
the
northland
they
faced
each
other
at
last
as
man
to
man
i
see
you
have
a
number
of
my
old
fishermen
marsh
observed
yes
we
were
fortunate
in
getting
such
good
ones
you
were
fortunate
in
many
ways
in
fact
you
are
a
very
lucky
young
man
indeed
how
well
do
you
think
you
were
lucky
to
beat
that
strike
it
was
altogether
luck
however
i
do
consider
myself
fortunate
in
escaping
at
the
last
moment
boyd
laughed
easily
by
the
way
what
happened
to
the
man
they
mistook
for
me
let
him
go
i
believe
i
did
pay
much
attention
to
the
matter
marsh
had
been
using
his
eyes
to
good
advantage
and
seeing
the
work
even
better
in
hand
than
he
had
supposed
he
was
moved
by
irritation
and
the
desire
to
goad
his
opponent
to
say
more
than
he
had
intended
i
rather
think
you
will
have
a
lot
to
explain
one
of
these
days
he
said
with
deliberate
menace
with
fifty
thousand
cases
of
salmon
aboard
bedford
i
will
explain
anything
meanwhile
the
police
may
go
to
the
devil
the
cool
assurance
of
the
young
man
tone
roused
his
tormentor
like
a
personal
affront
you
got
away
from
seattle
but
there
is
a
commissioner
at
dutch
harbor
also
a
deputy
marshal
who
may
have
better
success
with
a
warrant
than
those
policemen
had
the
trust
manager
could
not
keep
down
the
angry
tremor
in
his
voice
and
the
other
perceiving
it
replied
in
a
manner
designed
to
inflame
him
still
more
yes
i
have
heard
of
those
officers
i
understand
they
are
both
in
your
employ
what
i
hear
you
have
bought
them
do
you
mean
to
insinuate
i
do
mean
to
insinuate
anything
listen
we
are
where
we
can
talk
plainly
marsh
and
i
am
tired
of
all
this
subterfuge
you
did
what
you
could
to
stop
me
you
even
tried
to
have
me
killed
you
dare
to
but
i
guess
it
never
occurred
to
you
that
i
may
be
just
as
desperate
as
you
are
the
men
stared
at
each
other
with
hostile
eyes
but
the
accusation
had
come
so
suddenly
and
with
such
boldness
as
to
rob
marsh
of
words
emerson
went
on
in
the
same
level
voice
i
broke
through
in
spite
of
you
and
i
on
the
job
if
you
want
to
cry
quits
i
willing
but
by
god
i
wo
be
balked
and
if
any
of
your
hired
marshals
try
to
take
me
before
i
put
up
my
catch
i
put
you
away
understand
willis
marsh
recoiled
involuntarily
before
the
sudden
ferocity
that
blazed
up
in
the
speaker
face
you
are
insane
he
cried
am
i
emerson
laughed
harshly
well
i
just
crazy
enough
to
do
what
i
say
i
do
think
you
the
kind
that
wants
trouble
so
let
each
attend
to
his
own
affair
i
doing
well
thank
you
and
i
think
i
can
get
along
better
if
yon
do
come
back
here
until
i
send
for
you
something
might
fall
on
you
marsh
full
red
lips
went
pallid
with
rage
as
he
said
then
it
is
to
be
war
eh
suit
yourself
boyd
pointed
to
the
shore
your
boatman
is
waiting
for
you
as
marsh
made
his
way
to
the
water
edge
he
stumbled
like
a
blind
man
his
lips
were
bleeding
where
his
small
sharp
teeth
had
bitten
them
and
he
panted
like
an
hysterical
woman
during
the
next
fortnight
the
began
to
assemble
standing
in
under
a
great
spread
of
canvas
to
berth
close
alongside
the
two
steamships
for
once
the
ice
had
moved
north
there
was
no
further
obstacle
to
their
coming
and
the
harbor
was
soon
livened
with
puffing
tugs
unwieldy
lighters
and
fleets
of
smaller
vessels
where
but
a
short
time
before
the
brooding
silence
had
been
undisturbed
save
for
the
plaint
of
and
the
lazy
voices
of
natives
a
noisy
army
was
now
at
work
the
bustle
of
a
great
preparation
arose
languid
began
to
unfurl
above
the
stacks
of
the
canneries
the
stamp
and
clank
of
hammer
and
saw
maintained
a
hubbub
down
at
the
new
plant
scows
were
being
launched
while
yet
the
pitch
was
warm
on
their
seams
buildings
were
rising
rapidly
and
a
crew
had
gone
up
the
river
to
get
out
a
raft
of
piles
on
the
morning
after
the
arrival
of
the
last
ship
emerson
and
his
companions
were
treated
to
a
genuine
surprise
cherry
had
come
down
to
the
site
as
usual
she
could
not
let
a
day
go
by
without
visiting
the
place
and
clyde
after
a
tardy
breakfast
had
just
come
ashore
they
were
watching
big
george
direct
the
launching
of
a
scow
when
all
of
a
sudden
they
heard
a
familiar
voice
behind
them
cry
cheerfully
hello
white
folks
here
we
are
all
together
again
they
turned
to
behold
a
man
beaming
benignly
upon
them
he
was
dirty
his
clothes
were
in
rags
and
through
a
riotous
bristle
of
beard
that
hid
his
thin
features
a
mangy
patch
showed
on
either
cheek
it
was
undeniably
fingerless
fraser
but
how
changed
how
altered
from
that
radiant
flower
of
indolence
they
had
known
he
was
pallid
emaciated
and
bedraggled
his
attitude
showed
hunger
and
abuse
and
his
bony
joints
seemed
about
to
pierce
through
their
tattered
covering
as
they
stood
speechless
with
amazement
he
made
his
identification
complete
by
protruding
his
tongue
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
gravely
closing
one
eye
in
a
wink
of
exceeding
wisdom
fraser
they
cried
in
chorus
then
fell
upon
him
noisily
shaking
his
grimy
hands
and
slapping
his
back
until
he
coughed
weakly
summoned
by
their
shouts
big
george
broke
in
upon
the
incoherent
greeting
and
at
sight
of
his
late
comrade
began
to
laugh
hoarsely
glad
to
see
you
old
man
he
cried
but
how
did
you
get
here
fraser
drew
himself
up
with
injured
dignity
then
spoke
in
dramatic
accents
i
worked
my
way
he
showed
the
whites
of
his
eyes
tragically
you
look
like
you
walked
in
from
kansas
george
declared
yes
sir
i
me
how
where
on
that
bloody
he
stretched
a
long
arm
toward
the
harbor
in
a
theatrical
gesture
but
the
police
queried
boyd
oh
i
squared
them
easy
it
you
they
want
yes
sir
i
again
he
scanned
their
faces
anxiously
i
a
what
that
what
i
said
i
rustled
till
the
smell
of
food
gives
me
a
cold
sweat
i
as
hungry
as
a
starving
cuban
and
yet
the
sight
of
a
knife
and
fork
turns
my
stomach
he
wheeled
suddenly
upon
alton
clyde
whose
burst
of
shrill
laughter
offended
him
do
cry
your
sympathy
unmans
me
tell
us
about
it
urged
cherry
what
the
use
he
demanded
with
a
glare
at
clyde
that
would
understand
go
ahead
boyd
seconded
with
twitching
lips
you
look
as
if
you
had
worked
and
worked
hard
hard
i
the
only
man
in
the
world
who
knows
what
hard
work
is
start
at
the
beginning
when
you
were
arrested
well
i
did
care
nothing
about
the
sneeze
he
took
up
the
tale
for
i
figure
it
out
that
they
ca
slough
me
without
clearing
you
so
i
never
take
no
and
sure
enough
about
third
the
bulls
spring
me
and
i
screw
down
the
main
stem
to
the
drink
and
get
jerry
to
your
fade
tell
it
straight
interrupted
cherry
they
do
understand
you
well
there
ai
any
pullmans
running
to
this
resort
so
i
stow
away
on
a
but
somebody
flags
me
then
i
try
to
hire
out
as
a
fisherman
but
i
ai
there
with
the
gang
talk
and
my
stuff
drags
so
i
fix
it
for
a
on
blessed
that
her
name
can
you
beat
that
for
a
monaker
this
sailor
of
mine
goes
good
to
grub
me
but
he
never
shows
for
hours
or
years
i
forget
which
anyhow
i
stand
it
as
long
as
i
can
then
i
dig
my
way
up
to
a
hatch
and
mew
like
a
it
seems
they
were
hep
from
the
start
and
battened
me
down
on
purpose
then
made
book
on
how
long
i
stay
hid
oh
it
a
funny
joke
and
they
all
get
a
stomach
laugh
when
i
show
when
i
offer
to
pay
my
way
they
insulted
nix
that
ai
their
graft
they
would
take
money
from
a
stranger
oh
no
they
permit
me
to
my
way
the
scullion
has
quit
see
so
they
promote
me
to
his
job
it
the
only
job
i
ever
held
and
i
held
it
because
it
let
go
of
me
savvy
there
only
three
hundred
men
aboard
blessed
so
all
i
have
to
do
regular
is
to
understudy
the
cooks
carry
the
grub
wait
on
table
wash
the
dishes
mop
the
floors
make
the
officers
beds
peel
six
bushels
of
potatoes
a
day
and
do
the
laundry
then
of
course
there
some
odd
tasks
oh
it
was
a
swell
job
more
like
a
pastime
when
a
mop
sees
me
coming
now
it
dances
a
hornpipe
and
i
ca
look
a
in
the
face
all
i
see
in
my
dreams
is
and
i
got
in
my
veins
and
the
whole
universe
looks
greasy
to
me
naturally
it
was
my
luck
to
pick
the
slowest
ship
in
the
harbor
we
lay
three
weeks
in
the
ice
that
all
and
nobody
worked
but
me
and
the
you
deserted
this
morning
eh
i
did
i
beat
the
barrier
and
now
i
want
a
bath
and
some
clean
clothes
and
a
whole
lot
of
sleep
you
do
need
to
disturb
me
till
fall
he
showed
no
interest
whatever
in
the
new
plant
refusing
even
to
look
it
over
or
to
express
an
opinion
upon
the
progress
of
the
work
so
they
sent
him
out
to
the
ship
where
for
days
he
remained
in
a
lethargy
basking
in
the
sun
sleeping
of
the
time
and
spending
his
waking
hours
in
repeating
the
awful
tale
of
his
disgraceful
peonage
to
unload
the
machinery
particularly
the
heavier
pieces
was
by
no
means
a
simple
matter
owing
to
the
furious
tides
that
set
in
and
out
of
the
kalvik
river
the
first
mishap
occurred
during
the
trip
on
which
the
boilers
were
towed
in
and
it
looked
to
boyd
less
like
an
accident
than
a
carefully
planned
move
to
cripple
him
at
one
stroke
the
other
ships
were
busily
discharging
and
the
roadstead
was
alive
with
small
craft
of
various
kinds
when
the
huge
boilers
were
swung
over
the
side
of
bedford
and
blocked
into
position
for
the
journey
to
the
shore
george
and
a
of
his
men
went
along
with
the
load
while
emerson
remained
on
the
ship
they
were
just
well
under
way
when
either
by
the
merest
chance
or
by
malicious
design
several
of
the
rival
company
towboats
moored
to
the
neighboring
ships
cast
off
the
anchorage
was
crowded
and
a
boiling
tide
made
it
difficult
at
best
to
avoid
collision
hearing
a
confused
shouting
to
shoreward
boyd
ran
to
the
rail
in
time
to
see
one
of
the
company
tugs
at
the
head
of
a
string
of
towboats
bearing
down
ahead
of
the
current
directly
upon
his
own
lighter
already
it
was
so
close
at
hand
as
to
make
disaster
seem
inevitable
he
saw
balt
wave
his
arms
furiously
and
heard
him
bellow
profane
warnings
while
the
fishermen
scurried
about
excitedly
but
still
the
tug
held
to
its
course
boyd
raised
his
voice
in
a
wild
alarm
but
had
they
heard
him
there
was
nothing
they
could
have
done
then
suddenly
the
affair
altered
its
complexion
the
oncoming
tug
was
barely
twice
its
length
from
the
scow
when
boyd
saw
big
george
cease
his
violent
antics
and
level
a
revolver
directly
at
the
of
the
opposing
craft
two
puffs
of
smoke
issued
from
weapon
then
out
from
the
structure
the
steersman
plunged
scrambled
down
the
deck
and
into
the
shelter
of
the
house
instantly
the
bow
of
the
tug
swung
off
and
she
came
on
sidewise
striking
balt
scow
a
glancing
blow
the
sound
of
which
rose
above
the
shouts
while
its
force
threw
the
big
fellow
and
his
companions
to
their
knees
and
shattered
the
glass
in
the
windows
the
boats
behind
fouled
each
other
then
drifted
down
upon
the
scow
and
the
tide
seizing
the
whole
flotilla
began
to
spin
it
slowly
rushing
to
the
ladder
emerson
leaped
into
another
launch
which
fortunately
was
at
hand
and
the
next
instant
as
the
little
craft
sped
out
from
the
side
of
bedford
he
saw
that
a
fight
was
in
progress
on
the
lighter
it
was
over
quickly
and
before
he
reached
the
scene
the
current
had
drifted
the
tows
apart
george
it
seemed
had
boarded
the
tug
dragged
the
captain
off
and
beaten
him
half
insensible
before
the
man
companions
had
come
to
his
rescue
is
the
scow
damaged
emerson
cried
as
he
came
alongside
she
leaking
but
i
guess
we
can
make
it
george
reassured
him
they
directed
the
second
launch
to
make
fast
and
towed
by
both
tugs
they
succeeded
in
beaching
their
cargo
a
mile
below
the
landing
we
calk
her
at
low
tide
george
declared
well
satisfied
at
this
outcome
of
the
misadventure
then
he
fell
to
reviling
the
men
who
had
caused
it
do
waste
your
breath
on
them
boyd
advised
we
lucky
enough
as
it
is
if
that
tug
had
sheered
off
she
would
have
cut
us
down
sure
that
fellow
done
it
george
swore
seamen
ai
that
careless
he
tried
to
tell
me
he
was
rattled
but
i
rattled
if
that
the
case
they
may
try
it
again
said
the
younger
man
huh
i
pack
a
from
now
on
and
i
bet
they
do
get
within
hailing
distance
without
an
the
more
calmly
emerson
regarded
the
incident
the
more
he
marvelled
at
the
that
had
saved
him
we
had
better
wake
up
he
said
we
have
been
asleep
so
far
if
marsh
planned
this
he
will
plan
something
more
yes
and
if
he
puts
one
wallop
over
we
done
for
george
agreed
pessimistically
i
keep
a
watchman
aboard
the
scows
hereafter
that
our
vital
spot
but
the
days
sped
past
without
further
interference
and
the
construction
of
the
plant
progressed
by
leaps
and
bounds
while
bedford
having
discharged
her
cargo
steamed
away
to
return
in
august
the
middle
of
june
brought
the
first
king
salmon
scouts
sent
on
ahead
of
the
sockeyes
but
boyd
made
no
effort
to
take
advantage
of
this
run
laboring
manfully
to
prepare
for
the
advance
of
the
main
army
that
terrific
horde
that
was
soon
to
come
from
the
mysterious
depths
either
to
make
or
ruin
him
once
the
run
proper
started
there
would
be
no
more
opportunity
for
building
or
for
setting
up
machinery
he
must
be
ready
and
waiting
by
the
first
of
july
for
some
time
his
had
been
busy
night
and
day
turning
out
great
heaps
of
gleaming
cans
while
the
carpenters
and
machinists
completed
their
tasks
the
were
overhauling
their
gear
the
beach
was
lined
with
on
the
dock
great
piles
of
seines
and
were
being
inspected
three
miles
below
big
george
with
a
picked
crew
and
a
was
building
the
it
consisted
of
leads
or
rows
of
piling
capped
with
stringers
upon
which
netting
was
hung
and
terminated
in
hearts
corrals
and
spillers
the
intricate
arrangements
of
webbing
and
timbers
out
of
which
the
fish
were
to
be
taken
it
was
for
the
title
to
the
ground
where
his
present
operations
were
going
forward
that
george
had
been
so
cruelly
disciplined
by
the
interests
and
while
he
had
held
stubbornly
to
his
rights
for
years
in
spite
of
the
bitterest
persecution
he
was
now
for
the
first
time
able
to
utilize
his
site
accordingly
his
exultation
was
tremendous
as
for
boyd
the
fever
in
his
veins
mounted
daily
as
he
saw
his
dream
assuming
concrete
form
the
many
problems
arising
as
the
work
advanced
afforded
him
unceasing
activity
the
unforeseen
obstacles
which
were
encountered
hourly
required
swift
and
certain
judgment
taxing
his
ingenuity
to
the
utmost
he
became
so
filled
with
it
all
so
steeped
with
the
spirit
of
his
surroundings
that
he
had
thought
for
nothing
else
every
dawn
marked
the
beginning
of
a
new
battle
every
twilight
heralded
another
council
his
duties
swamped
him
he
was
worried
exultant
happy
always
he
found
cherry
at
his
shoulder
unobtrusive
and
silent
for
the
most
part
yet
intensely
observant
and
keenly
alive
to
every
action
she
seemed
to
have
the
faculty
of
divination
knowing
when
to
be
silent
and
when
to
join
her
mood
with
his
and
she
gave
him
valuable
help
for
she
possessed
a
practical
mind
and
a
masculine
aptitude
for
details
that
surprised
both
him
and
george
but
rapidly
as
the
work
progressed
it
seemed
that
would
never
smile
upon
them
for
long
one
day
when
their
preparations
were
nearly
completed
a
foreman
came
to
boyd
and
said
excitedly
boss
i
like
you
to
look
at
the
iron
chinks
right
away
what
up
i
do
know
but
something
is
wrong
a
hurried
examination
showed
the
machines
to
be
cunningly
crippled
certain
parts
were
entirely
missing
while
others
were
broken
they
were
all
right
when
we
brought
them
ashore
the
man
declared
somebody
been
at
them
lately
when
how
questioned
boyd
we
have
had
watchmen
on
guard
all
the
time
have
any
strangers
been
about
nobody
seems
to
know
when
we
got
ready
to
set
just
now
i
saw
this
the
iron
chink
or
mechanical
cleaner
is
perhaps
the
most
ingenious
of
the
many
devices
used
in
the
salmon
fisheries
it
is
an
yet
very
effective
contrivance
of
revolving
knives
and
conveyors
which
seizes
the
fish
whole
and
delivers
it
cleaned
clipped
cut
and
ready
to
be
washed
with
superhuman
dexterity
it
does
the
work
of
twenty
butchers
without
the
aid
of
these
iron
chinks
boyd
knew
that
his
fish
would
spoil
before
they
could
be
handled
in
a
panic
he
pursued
his
investigation
far
enough
to
realize
that
the
machines
were
beyond
repair
that
what
had
seemed
at
first
a
trivial
mishap
was
in
fact
an
appalling
disaster
then
since
his
own
experience
left
him
without
resource
he
hastened
straightway
to
george
balt
a
run
down
the
bay
and
he
clambered
from
his
launch
to
the
where
amid
the
confusion
and
noise
he
made
known
his
tidings
the
big
fellow
calmness
amazed
him
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
butcher
by
hand
said
the
fisherman
but
how
that
takes
skilled
labor
lots
of
it
george
grinned
i
too
old
a
bird
to
be
caught
like
this
i
figured
on
accidents
from
the
start
and
when
i
hired
my
chinamen
i
included
a
crew
of
cutters
by
jove
you
never
told
me
there
was
no
use
we
ai
licked
yet
not
by
a
damned
sight
willis
marsh
will
have
to
try
again
chapter
xxi
a
hand
in
the
dark
while
they
were
talking
a
towing
a
came
into
view
boyd
asked
the
meaning
of
its
presence
in
this
part
of
the
river
i
do
know
answered
big
george
staring
intently
yonder
looks
like
another
one
behind
it
with
a
raft
of
piles
i
thought
all
the
company
traps
were
so
they
are
i
ca
tell
what
they
up
to
a
later
when
the
new
flotilla
had
come
to
anchor
a
short
distance
below
emerson
companion
began
to
swear
i
might
have
known
it
what
marsh
aims
to
us
what
is
that
he
going
to
build
a
trap
on
each
side
of
this
one
and
cut
off
our
fish
good
lord
can
he
do
that
sure
why
not
the
law
gives
us
six
hundred
yards
both
ways
as
long
as
he
stays
outside
of
that
limit
he
can
do
anything
he
wants
to
then
of
what
use
is
our
trap
the
salmon
follow
definite
courses
close
to
the
shore
and
if
he
intercepts
them
before
they
reach
us
why
then
we
get
only
what
he
lets
through
that
his
plan
said
big
george
sourly
it
an
old
game
but
it
do
always
work
you
ca
tell
what
salmon
will
do
till
they
do
it
i
studied
this
point
of
land
for
five
years
and
i
know
more
about
it
than
anybody
else
except
god
if
the
fish
hug
the
shore
then
we
up
against
it
but
i
think
they
strike
in
about
here
why
i
chose
this
site
we
ca
tell
though
till
the
run
starts
all
we
can
do
now
is
see
that
them
people
keep
their
distance
the
lead
of
a
consists
of
a
row
of
piling
that
runs
out
from
the
shore
for
many
hundred
feet
forming
a
high
stout
fence
that
turns
the
schools
of
fish
and
leads
them
into
cunningly
contrived
enclosures
or
pounds
at
the
outer
extremity
from
which
they
are
brailed
as
needed
these
corrals
are
so
built
that
once
the
fish
are
inside
they
can
not
escape
the
entire
structure
is
devised
upon
the
principle
that
the
salmon
will
not
make
a
short
turn
but
will
swim
as
nearly
as
possible
in
a
straight
line
it
looked
to
boyd
as
if
marsh
by
blocking
the
line
of
progress
above
and
below
had
virtually
destroyed
the
efficiency
of
the
new
trap
rendering
the
cost
of
its
construction
a
total
loss
sometimes
you
can
cork
a
trap
and
sometimes
you
ca
balt
went
on
it
all
depends
on
the
currents
the
lay
of
the
bars
and
a
lot
of
things
we
do
know
nothing
about
i
spent
years
in
trying
to
locate
the
point
where
them
fish
strike
in
and
i
think
it
just
below
here
it
all
depend
on
how
good
i
guessed
exactly
and
if
you
guessed
wrong
then
we
fish
with
nets
like
we
used
to
before
there
was
any
traps
that
evening
when
he
had
seen
the
started
emerson
decided
to
walk
up
to
cherry
house
for
he
was
worried
over
the
developments
and
felt
that
an
hour
of
the
girl
society
might
serve
to
clear
his
thoughts
his
nerves
were
from
the
tension
of
the
past
weeks
and
he
knew
himself
in
the
condition
of
an
athlete
trained
to
the
minute
in
his
earlier
days
he
had
frequently
felt
the
same
nervousness
the
same
intense
mental
activity
just
prior
to
an
important
race
or
game
and
he
was
familiar
with
those
disquieting
panicky
moments
when
for
no
apparent
reason
his
heart
thumped
and
a
physical
sickness
mastered
him
he
knew
that
the
fever
would
leave
him
once
the
salmon
began
to
run
just
as
it
had
always
vanished
at
the
crack
of
the
starter
pistol
or
the
shrill
note
of
the
whistle
he
was
eager
for
action
eager
to
find
himself
possessed
of
that
gloating
gruelling
fury
that
drives
men
through
to
the
finish
line
meanwhile
he
was
anxious
to
divert
his
mind
into
other
channels
cherry
house
was
situated
a
short
distance
above
the
cannery
which
served
as
willis
marsh
headquarters
and
boyd
path
necessarily
took
him
past
his
enemy
very
stronghold
finding
the
tide
too
high
to
permit
of
passing
beneath
the
dock
he
turned
up
among
the
buildings
where
to
his
surprise
he
encountered
his
own
talking
earnestly
with
a
stranger
the
fisherman
started
guiltily
as
he
saw
him
and
boyd
questioned
him
sharply
what
are
you
doing
here
larsen
i
just
walked
up
after
supper
to
have
a
talk
with
an
old
mate
who
is
he
boyd
glanced
suspiciously
at
larsen
companion
he
marsh
foreman
emerson
spoke
out
bluntly
see
here
i
do
like
this
these
people
have
caused
me
a
lot
of
trouble
already
and
i
do
want
my
men
hanging
around
here
oh
that
all
right
said
larsen
carelessly
him
and
me
used
to
fish
together
and
as
if
this
were
a
sufficient
explanation
he
turned
back
to
his
conversation
leaving
emerson
to
proceed
on
his
way
vaguely
displeased
at
the
episode
yet
reflecting
that
heretofore
he
had
never
had
occasion
to
doubt
larsen
loyalty
he
found
cherry
at
home
and
flinging
himself
into
one
of
her
relieved
his
mind
of
the
day
occurrences
marsh
is
building
those
traps
purely
out
of
spite
she
declared
indignantly
when
he
had
finished
he
does
need
any
more
fish
he
has
plenty
of
traps
farther
up
the
river
to
be
sure
it
looks
as
if
we
might
have
to
depend
upon
the
we
will
know
before
long
if
the
fish
strike
in
where
george
expects
marsh
will
be
out
a
pretty
penny
and
if
they
do
strike
in
where
george
expects
we
will
be
out
all
the
expense
of
building
that
trap
exactly
it
a
fascinating
business
is
it
it
a
business
in
which
the
unexpected
is
forever
happening
but
the
stakes
are
high
and
i
know
you
will
succeed
boyd
smiled
at
her
comforting
assurance
her
belief
in
him
was
always
stimulating
she
continued
have
you
heard
the
historic
story
about
the
pink
salmon
he
shook
his
head
well
there
was
a
certain
shrewd
old
in
washington
state
whose
catch
consisted
almost
wholly
of
pink
fish
as
you
know
that
variety
does
not
bring
as
high
a
price
as
red
salmon
like
these
well
finding
that
he
could
not
sell
his
catch
owing
to
the
popular
prejudice
about
color
this
man
printed
a
lot
of
striking
which
read
grade
pink
salmon
warranted
not
to
turn
red
in
the
can
they
tell
me
it
worked
like
a
charm
no
wonder
boyd
laughed
beginning
to
feel
the
tension
of
his
nerves
relax
at
the
restfulness
of
her
influence
as
usual
he
fell
at
once
into
the
mood
she
desired
for
him
he
saw
that
her
brows
were
furrowed
and
her
rosy
lips
drawn
into
an
unconscious
pout
as
she
said
more
to
herself
than
to
him
i
wish
i
were
a
man
i
like
to
engage
in
a
business
of
this
sort
something
that
would
require
ingenuity
and
daring
i
like
to
handle
big
affairs
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
in
a
business
of
that
sort
you
are
one
of
us
oh
but
you
and
george
are
doing
it
all
there
is
your
you
surely
handled
that
very
cleverly
cherry
expression
altered
and
she
shot
a
quick
glance
at
him
as
he
went
on
how
is
it
coming
along
i
have
heard
you
mention
it
lately
very
well
i
believe
the
men
were
down
the
other
day
and
told
me
it
was
a
big
thing
i
delighted
how
does
it
seem
to
be
rich
there
was
the
slightest
hint
of
constraint
in
the
girl
voice
as
she
stared
out
at
the
slowly
gathering
twilight
murmuring
i
i
hardly
know
rich
that
has
always
been
my
dream
and
yet
the
wonderful
feature
about
dreams
he
took
advantage
of
her
pause
to
say
is
that
they
come
true
not
all
of
them
not
the
real
wonderful
dreams
she
returned
oh
yes
my
dream
is
coming
true
and
so
is
yours
i
have
given
up
hoping
for
that
she
said
without
turning
but
you
should
give
up
remember
that
all
the
great
things
ever
accomplished
were
only
dreams
at
first
and
the
greater
the
accomplishments
the
more
impossible
they
seemed
to
begin
with
something
in
the
girl
attitude
and
in
her
silence
made
him
feel
that
his
words
rang
hollow
and
commonplace
while
they
had
talked
an
unaccustomed
excitement
had
been
mounting
in
his
brain
and
it
held
him
now
in
a
kind
of
delicious
embarrassment
it
was
as
if
both
had
been
suddenly
enfolded
in
a
new
and
mysterious
understanding
without
the
need
of
speech
he
did
not
tell
himself
that
cherry
loved
him
but
he
roused
to
a
fresh
perception
of
her
beauty
and
felt
himself
privileged
in
her
nearness
at
the
same
time
he
was
seized
with
the
old
curiosity
to
learn
her
history
what
wealth
of
romance
lay
shadowed
in
her
eyes
what
tragic
story
was
concealed
by
her
consistent
silence
he
could
only
guess
for
she
was
a
woman
who
spoke
rarely
of
herself
and
lived
wholly
in
the
present
her
very
reticence
inspired
confidence
and
boyd
felt
sure
that
here
was
a
girl
to
whom
one
might
confess
the
inmost
secrets
of
a
wretched
soul
and
rest
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
his
confession
would
be
inviolate
as
if
locked
in
the
heart
of
mountains
he
knew
her
for
a
steadfast
friend
and
he
that
she
was
beautiful
not
only
in
face
and
form
but
in
all
those
little
indescribable
mannerisms
which
stamp
the
individual
and
this
girl
was
here
alone
with
him
so
close
that
by
stretching
out
his
arms
he
might
enfold
her
she
allowed
him
to
come
and
go
at
will
her
intimacy
with
him
was
almost
like
that
of
an
unspoiled
boy
yet
different
so
different
that
he
thrilled
at
the
thought
and
the
blood
pounded
up
into
his
throat
it
may
have
been
the
unusual
ardor
of
his
gaze
that
warmed
her
cheeks
and
brought
her
eyes
back
from
the
world
outside
at
any
rate
she
turned
flashing
him
a
startled
glance
that
caused
his
pulse
to
leap
anew
her
eyes
widened
and
a
flush
spread
slowly
upward
to
her
hair
then
her
lids
drooped
as
if
weighted
by
unwonted
shyness
and
rising
silently
she
went
past
him
to
the
piano
never
before
had
she
surprised
that
look
in
his
eyes
and
at
the
realization
a
wave
of
confusion
surged
over
her
she
strove
to
calm
herself
through
her
music
which
shielded
while
it
gave
expression
to
her
mood
and
neither
spoke
as
the
evening
shadows
crept
in
upon
them
but
the
exaltation
was
the
thought
came
that
boyd
feeling
was
but
transitory
he
was
not
the
sort
to
burn
lasting
incense
before
more
than
one
shrine
nevertheless
at
this
moment
he
was
hers
and
in
the
joy
of
that
certainty
she
let
the
moments
slip
he
stopped
her
at
last
and
they
talked
in
the
floating
along
together
half
dreamily
as
if
upon
the
bosom
of
some
great
current
that
bore
them
into
strange
regions
which
they
dreaded
yet
longed
to
explore
they
heard
a
child
crying
somewhere
in
the
rear
of
the
house
and
chakawana
voice
soothing
then
in
a
moment
the
indian
girl
appeared
in
the
doorway
saying
something
about
going
out
with
constantine
cherry
acquiesced
half
consciously
impatient
of
the
intrusion
for
a
long
time
they
talked
so
completely
in
concord
that
for
the
most
part
their
voices
were
low
and
their
sentences
so
incomplete
that
they
would
have
sounded
incoherent
and
foolish
to
other
ears
they
were
roused
finally
by
the
appreciation
that
it
had
grown
very
late
and
a
storm
was
brewing
boyd
rose
and
going
to
the
door
saw
that
the
sky
was
deeply
overcast
rendering
the
night
as
dark
as
in
a
far
lower
latitude
i
overstayed
my
welcome
he
ventured
and
smiled
at
her
answering
laugh
with
a
trace
of
solicitude
she
said
wait
i
get
you
a
but
he
reached
out
a
detaining
hand
in
the
darkness
it
encountered
the
bare
flesh
of
her
arm
please
do
you
have
to
strike
a
light
to
find
it
and
i
want
a
light
now
he
was
standing
on
the
steps
with
her
slightly
above
him
and
so
close
that
he
heard
her
breath
it
been
a
pleasant
evening
she
said
inanely
i
saw
you
for
the
first
time
cherry
i
think
i
have
begun
to
know
you
again
she
felt
her
heart
leap
reaching
out
to
say
his
hand
slipped
down
over
her
arm
like
a
caress
until
her
palm
lay
in
his
with
trembling
gentle
hands
she
pushed
him
from
her
but
even
when
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
had
died
away
she
stood
with
eyes
straining
into
the
gloom
in
her
breast
a
gladness
so
stifling
that
she
raised
her
hands
to
still
its
tumult
emerson
with
the
glow
still
upon
him
felt
a
deep
contentment
which
he
did
not
trouble
to
analyze
it
has
been
said
that
two
opposite
impulses
may
exist
side
by
side
in
a
man
mind
like
two
hostile
armies
which
have
camped
close
together
in
the
night
unrevealed
to
each
other
until
the
morning
to
emerson
the
dawn
had
not
yet
come
he
had
no
thought
of
disloyalty
to
mildred
but
after
his
fashion
took
the
feeling
of
the
moment
unreflectively
his
mood
was
averse
to
thought
and
moreover
the
darkness
forced
him
to
give
instant
attention
to
his
path
while
the
waters
of
the
bay
out
to
his
right
showed
a
ghostly
gray
objects
beneath
the
bluff
where
he
walked
were
cloaked
in
impenetrable
shadow
the
air
was
damp
with
the
breath
of
coming
rain
and
at
rare
intervals
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
torn
edges
of
clouds
hurrying
ahead
of
a
wind
that
was
yet
unfelt
when
the
black
bulk
of
marsh
cannery
loomed
ahead
of
him
he
left
the
gravel
beach
and
turned
up
among
the
buildings
seeking
to
retrace
his
former
course
he
noticed
that
once
he
had
left
the
noisy
shingle
his
feet
made
no
sound
in
the
soft
moss
thus
it
was
that
as
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
first
building
he
nearly
ran
against
a
man
who
was
standing
motionless
against
the
wall
the
fellow
seemed
as
startled
at
the
encounter
as
emerson
and
with
a
sharp
exclamation
leaped
away
and
vanished
into
the
gloom
boyd
lost
no
time
in
gaining
the
plank
runway
that
led
to
the
dock
and
finding
an
angle
in
the
building
backed
into
it
and
waited
that
he
had
stumbled
into
a
trap
he
reflected
that
both
the
hour
and
the
circumstances
were
unpropitious
for
in
case
he
should
meet
with
foul
play
marsh
might
plausibly
claim
that
he
had
been
mistaken
for
a
marauder
he
determined
therefore
to
proceed
with
the
greatest
caution
from
his
momentary
glimpse
of
the
man
as
he
made
off
he
knew
that
he
was
tall
and
active
just
the
sort
of
person
to
prove
dangerous
in
an
encounter
but
if
his
suspicions
were
correct
there
must
be
others
close
by
and
boyd
wondered
why
he
had
heard
no
signal
after
a
breathless
wait
of
a
moment
or
two
he
stole
cautiously
out
and
selecting
the
darkest
shadows
slipped
from
one
to
another
till
he
was
caught
by
the
sound
of
voices
issuing
from
the
yawning
entrance
of
the
main
building
on
his
right
the
next
moment
his
tension
relaxed
one
of
the
speakers
was
a
woman
evidently
his
alarm
had
been
needless
for
these
people
whoever
they
were
made
no
effort
to
conceal
their
presence
on
the
contrary
the
woman
had
raised
her
tone
to
a
louder
pitch
although
her
words
were
still
undistinguishable
greatly
relieved
boyd
was
about
to
go
on
when
a
sharp
cry
like
a
signal
came
in
the
woman
voice
a
cry
which
turned
to
a
genuine
wail
of
distress
the
listener
heard
a
man
voice
cursing
in
answer
and
then
the
sound
of
a
scuffle
followed
at
length
by
a
choking
cry
that
brought
him
bounding
into
the
building
he
ran
forward
recklessly
but
before
he
had
covered
half
the
distance
he
collided
violently
with
a
piece
of
machinery
and
went
sprawling
to
the
floor
a
glance
upward
revealed
the
dim
outlines
of
a
topper
and
showed
him
farther
down
the
building
silhouetted
briefly
against
the
lesser
darkness
of
the
windows
two
struggling
figures
as
he
regained
his
footing
something
rushed
past
him
man
or
animal
he
could
not
tell
which
for
its
feet
made
no
more
sound
upon
the
floor
than
those
of
a
then
as
he
bolted
forward
he
heard
a
man
cry
out
and
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
turmoil
his
hands
encountered
a
human
body
and
he
seized
it
only
to
be
hurled
aside
as
if
with
a
giant
strength
again
he
clinched
with
a
man
form
and
bore
it
to
the
floor
cursing
at
the
darkness
and
reaching
for
its
throat
his
antagonist
raised
his
voice
in
wild
clamor
while
boyd
braced
himself
for
another
assault
from
those
huge
hands
he
had
met
a
moment
before
but
it
did
not
come
instead
he
heard
a
cry
from
the
woman
an
answer
in
a
deeper
voice
and
then
swift
pattering
footsteps
growing
fainter
meanwhile
the
man
with
whom
he
was
locked
was
fighting
desperately
with
hands
and
feet
and
teeth
shouting
hoarsely
other
footsteps
sounded
now
this
time
approaching
then
at
the
door
a
lantern
flared
a
watchman
came
running
down
between
the
lines
of
machinery
followed
by
other
figures
half
revealed
boyd
had
pinned
his
antagonist
against
the
cold
sides
of
a
retort
at
last
and
with
fingers
clutched
about
his
throat
was
beating
his
head
violently
against
the
iron
when
by
the
lantern
gleam
he
caught
one
glimpse
of
the
fat
purple
face
in
front
of
him
and
loosed
his
hold
with
a
startled
exclamation
released
from
the
grip
that
had
nearly
made
an
end
of
him
willis
marsh
staggered
to
his
feet
then
lurched
forward
as
if
about
to
fall
from
weakness
his
eyes
were
staring
his
blackened
tongue
protruded
while
his
head
battered
and
bleeding
lolled
grotesquely
from
side
to
side
as
if
in
hideous
merriment
his
clothes
were
torn
and
soiled
from
the
litter
underfoot
and
he
presented
a
frightful
picture
of
distress
but
it
was
not
this
that
caused
emerson
the
greatest
astonishment
the
man
was
wounded
badly
wounded
as
he
saw
by
the
red
stream
which
gushed
down
over
his
breast
boyd
cast
his
eyes
about
for
the
other
participants
in
the
encounter
but
they
were
nowhere
visible
only
an
open
door
in
the
shadows
close
by
hinted
at
the
mode
of
their
disappearance
there
was
a
brief
noisy
interval
during
which
emerson
was
too
astounded
to
attempt
an
answer
to
the
questions
hurled
broadcast
by
the
then
marsh
levelled
a
trembling
finger
at
him
and
cried
hysterically
there
he
is
men
he
tried
to
murder
me
i
i
hurt
i
have
him
arrested
the
seriousness
of
the
accusation
struck
the
young
man
on
the
instant
he
turned
upon
the
group
i
did
do
that
i
heard
a
fight
going
on
and
ran
in
here
he
a
liar
the
wounded
man
interrupted
shrilly
he
stabbed
me
see
he
tried
to
strip
the
shirt
from
his
wounds
then
fell
to
chattering
and
shaking
oh
god
i
hurt
he
staggered
to
a
and
sank
upon
it
weakly
fumbling
at
his
sodden
shoulder
i
did
do
that
repeated
boyd
i
do
know
who
stabbed
him
i
did
then
who
did
some
one
demanded
what
are
you
doing
in
here
you
a
killed
him
in
a
minute
said
the
man
with
the
lantern
we
fix
you
for
this
a
third
voice
threatened
listen
boyd
said
in
a
tone
to
make
them
pause
there
has
been
a
mistake
here
i
was
passing
the
building
when
i
heard
a
woman
scream
and
i
rushed
in
to
prevent
marsh
from
choking
her
to
death
a
woman
chorused
the
group
that
what
i
said
where
is
she
now
i
do
know
i
did
see
her
at
all
i
grappled
with
the
first
person
i
ran
into
she
must
have
gone
out
as
you
came
in
boyd
indicated
the
side
door
which
was
still
ajar
it
a
lie
screamed
marsh
it
the
truth
stoutly
maintained
emerson
and
there
was
a
man
with
her
too
who
was
she
marsh
who
was
the
man
she
she
i
do
know
do
lie
i
hurt
reiterated
the
stricken
man
feebly
then
seeing
the
bewilderment
in
the
faces
about
him
he
burst
out
anew
do
stand
there
like
a
lot
of
fools
why
do
you
get
him
if
i
stabbed
him
i
must
have
had
a
knife
emerson
said
again
checking
the
forward
movement
you
may
search
me
if
you
like
see
he
opened
his
coat
and
displayed
his
belt
he
got
a
some
one
said
yes
and
i
may
use
it
said
emerson
quietly
maybe
he
dropped
the
knife
said
the
watchman
and
began
to
search
about
the
floor
followed
by
the
others
it
may
have
been
the
woman
herself
who
stabbed
marsh
offered
emerson
he
was
strangling
her
when
i
arrived
roused
by
this
statement
to
a
fresh
denial
marsh
cried
out
i
tell
you
there
was
any
woman
and
there
is
any
knife
either
emerson
sneered
the
men
paused
uncertainly
seeing
that
they
were
undecided
whether
to
believe
him
or
his
assailant
marsh
went
on
if
he
has
a
knife
then
he
must
have
had
a
friend
with
him
then
tell
your
men
what
we
were
doing
in
here
and
how
you
came
to
be
alone
with
us
in
the
dark
emerson
stared
at
his
accuser
curiously
but
the
trust
manager
seemed
at
a
loss
see
here
marsh
if
you
will
tell
us
whom
you
were
choking
maybe
we
can
get
at
the
truth
of
this
affair
without
answering
marsh
rose
and
leaning
upon
the
watchman
arm
said
help
me
up
to
the
house
i
hurt
send
the
launch
to
the
upper
plant
for
john
he
knows
something
about
medicine
with
no
further
word
he
made
his
way
out
of
the
building
followed
by
the
mystified
fishermen
no
one
undertook
to
detain
emerson
and
he
went
his
way
wondering
what
lay
back
of
the
night
adventure
he
racked
his
brain
for
a
hint
as
to
the
identity
of
the
woman
and
the
reason
of
her
presence
alone
with
marsh
in
such
a
place
again
he
thought
of
that
mysterious
third
person
whose
movements
had
been
so
swift
and
furious
but
his
conjectures
left
him
more
at
sea
than
ever
of
one
thing
he
felt
sure
it
was
not
enmity
alone
that
prompted
marsh
to
accuse
him
of
the
stabbing
the
man
was
concealing
something
in
deadly
fear
of
the
truth
for
rather
than
submit
to
questioning
he
had
let
his
enemy
go
suddenly
boyd
paused
in
his
walk
recalling
again
the
shadowy
outlines
of
the
figure
with
whom
he
had
so
nearly
collided
on
his
way
up
from
the
beach
there
was
something
familiar
about
it
he
mused
then
with
a
low
whistle
of
surprise
he
smote
his
palms
together
he
began
to
see
dimly
for
more
than
an
hour
the
young
man
paced
back
and
forth
before
the
door
of
his
so
deeply
immersed
in
thought
that
only
the
breaking
storm
drove
him
within
when
at
last
he
retired
it
was
with
the
certainty
that
this
night
had
placed
a
new
weapon
in
his
hand
but
of
what
tremendous
value
it
was
destined
to
prove
he
little
knew
chapter
xxii
the
silver
horde
the
main
body
of
salmon
struck
into
the
kalvik
river
on
the
first
day
of
july
for
a
week
past
the
run
had
been
slowly
growing
while
the
canneries
tested
themselves
but
on
the
opening
day
of
the
new
month
the
horde
issued
boldly
forth
from
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
the
battle
began
in
earnest
they
came
during
the
hush
of
the
dawn
a
mad
crowding
throng
from
no
man
land
to
wake
the
and
people
the
shimmering
reaches
of
the
bay
lashing
them
to
sudden
life
and
fury
outside
the
languorous
ocean
heaved
as
smiling
and
serene
as
ever
but
within
the
harbor
a
wondrous
change
occurred
as
if
in
answer
to
some
signal
the
tides
were
quickened
by
a
coursing
multitude
steadfast
and
unafraid
yet
foredoomed
to
die
by
the
hand
of
man
or
else
more
surely
by
the
serving
of
their
destiny
clad
in
their
argent
mail
of
blue
and
green
they
worked
the
bay
to
madness
they
overwhelmed
the
waters
surging
forward
in
great
droves
and
columns
hesitating
only
long
enough
to
frolic
with
the
shifting
currents
as
if
rejoicing
in
their
strength
and
beauty
at
times
they
swam
with
cleaving
fins
exposed
again
they
churned
the
placid
waters
until
swift
combers
raced
across
the
shallow
bars
like
tidal
waves
while
the
deeper
channels
were
shot
through
with
shadowy
forms
or
pierced
by
the
lightning
glint
of
silvered
bellies
they
streamed
in
with
the
flood
tide
to
retreat
again
with
the
ebb
but
there
was
neither
haste
nor
caution
in
their
progress
they
had
come
in
answer
to
the
breeding
call
of
the
sea
and
its
exultation
was
upon
them
driving
them
relentlessly
onward
they
had
no
voice
against
its
overmastering
spell
mustering
in
the
early
light
like
a
swarm
of
giant
moths
the
raced
forth
with
the
flowing
tide
urged
by
sweep
and
sail
and
lusty
sinews
paying
out
their
nets
they
drifted
over
the
banks
like
flocks
of
resting
only
to
come
ploughing
back
again
deep
laden
with
their
spoils
grimy
tugboats
lay
beside
the
traps
shrilling
the
air
with
creaking
winches
as
they
brailed
the
struggling
fish
a
at
a
time
from
the
pounds
now
churned
to
milky
foam
by
the
throng
of
prisoners
and
all
the
time
the
big
plants
gulped
the
sea
harvest
faster
and
faster
clanking
and
gnashing
their
metal
jaws
while
the
mounds
of
salmon
lay
to
the
crews
that
fed
the
butchering
machines
the
time
had
come
for
man
to
take
his
toll
now
dawned
a
period
of
feverish
activity
wherein
no
one
might
rest
short
of
actual
exhaustion
haste
became
the
cry
and
comfort
fled
at
emerson
cannery
there
fell
a
sudden
panic
for
fifty
fishermen
quit
returning
from
the
banks
on
the
night
before
the
run
started
they
stacked
their
gear
and
notified
boyd
emerson
of
their
determination
then
despite
his
utmost
efforts
to
dissuade
them
they
took
their
packs
upon
their
shoulders
and
marched
up
the
beach
to
willis
marsh
plant
larsen
the
acted
as
their
spokesman
and
boyd
recognized
too
late
the
result
of
that
conversation
he
had
interrupted
on
the
night
of
his
visit
to
cherry
this
defection
diminished
his
by
more
than
half
and
while
the
shoremen
stoutly
maintained
their
loyalty
the
chance
of
putting
up
a
pack
seemed
lost
success
or
failure
in
the
behring
sea
fisheries
may
depend
upon
the
loss
of
a
day
emerson
found
himself
facing
a
situation
more
desperate
than
any
heretofore
marsh
had
delayed
the
execution
of
his
plans
until
the
run
had
started
and
there
was
no
possibility
of
recruiting
a
new
force
alarmed
beyond
measure
boyd
swallowed
his
pride
and
went
straightway
to
his
enemy
he
found
marsh
well
recovered
from
his
of
a
week
or
more
before
yet
extremely
cautious
for
his
safety
as
he
evidenced
by
conducting
the
interview
before
witnesses
we
are
and
i
gave
instructions
to
secure
every
available
man
he
announced
at
the
conclusion
of
emerson
story
it
is
not
my
fault
if
your
men
prefer
to
work
for
me
then
you
force
me
to
retaliate
said
boyd
i
shall
hire
your
men
out
from
under
you
marsh
laughed
provokingly
try
it
i
am
a
good
organizer
if
nothing
else
if
you
send
emissaries
to
my
plants
it
will
cause
certain
violence
and
i
think
you
had
better
avoid
that
for
we
outnumber
you
ten
to
one
stormy
accusations
and
retorts
followed
till
emerson
left
the
place
in
helpless
disgust
nor
had
he
hit
upon
any
method
of
relief
when
cherry
came
down
to
the
plant
on
the
following
morning
though
he
and
big
george
had
spent
the
night
in
conference
she
lost
no
time
in
futile
indignation
but
inquired
straightway
what
are
you
doing
about
it
the
fish
have
begun
to
run
and
you
afford
to
lose
an
hour
i
have
sent
a
man
to
each
of
the
other
plants
to
hire
fishermen
at
any
price
but
i
have
no
hope
that
they
will
succeed
marsh
has
his
crews
too
well
in
hand
for
that
cherry
nodded
they
would
dare
quit
him
now
he
never
let
them
return
to
this
country
if
they
did
meanwhile
the
rest
of
your
force
is
on
the
banks
i
presume
yes
how
many
boats
have
you
ten
heavens
and
this
is
the
first
day
of
the
run
it
looks
bad
it
has
the
trap
begun
to
fill
no
george
is
down
there
now
i
guess
marsh
succeeded
in
corking
it
meanwhile
all
the
other
plants
are
working
while
my
chinks
are
playing
cherry
gazed
curiously
at
her
companion
to
see
how
he
accepted
this
latest
shift
of
fortune
she
knew
that
it
spelled
disaster
for
a
light
catch
with
the
tremendous
financial
loss
entailed
would
not
only
mean
difficulty
with
hilliard
loan
but
other
complications
impossible
to
forecast
her
mind
sped
onward
to
the
effect
of
a
failure
upon
private
affairs
he
had
told
her
in
unmistakable
terms
that
this
was
his
last
chance
the
final
hope
upon
which
hung
the
realization
of
his
dreams
in
some
way
his
power
to
hold
mildred
wayland
was
bound
up
with
his
financial
success
if
he
should
lose
her
where
would
he
turn
she
asked
herself
and
something
within
her
answered
that
he
would
look
for
consolation
to
the
woman
who
had
stood
at
his
shoulder
all
these
weary
months
sudden
emotion
swept
over
her
at
the
thought
what
cared
she
for
his
success
or
failure
he
was
the
one
man
she
had
ever
known
the
mate
for
whom
she
had
been
moulded
if
this
were
his
last
chance
it
promised
to
be
the
opportunity
she
had
so
long
awaited
for
once
that
other
was
out
of
his
mind
cherry
felt
that
he
would
turn
to
her
she
knew
it
intuitively
knew
it
from
the
light
she
had
seen
in
his
eyes
that
night
at
her
house
knew
it
by
the
promptings
of
her
own
heart
at
this
moment
she
began
to
tremble
and
felt
her
breast
swelling
with
a
glad
determination
but
he
interrupted
her
flight
of
fancy
with
a
sigh
of
such
hopeless
weariness
that
her
pity
rose
instinctively
he
gave
her
a
sad
little
smile
as
he
said
i
seem
to
bring
misfortune
upon
every
one
connected
with
me
do
i
i
afraid
i
a
poor
sort
how
boyish
he
was
the
girl
thought
tenderly
yet
how
splendidly
brave
he
had
been
throughout
the
fight
there
was
a
voiceless
maternal
yearning
in
her
heart
as
she
asked
him
gravely
if
you
fail
now
it
will
mean
the
end
of
everything
will
it
not
yes
he
squared
his
tired
shoulders
but
i
am
not
beaten
yet
you
taught
me
never
to
give
up
cherry
if
i
have
to
go
back
home
without
a
catch
and
see
hilliard
take
this
plant
over
why
i
begin
once
more
at
something
new
and
some
day
i
will
succeed
but
i
give
up
i
can
what
salmon
we
catch
and
then
begin
all
over
again
next
season
and
suppose
you
do
succeed
suppose
hilliard
wo
carry
you
then
i
shall
try
something
else
maybe
i
shall
go
to
mining
again
i
do
know
anyhow
would
not
let
me
grow
disheartened
if
she
were
here
she
would
let
me
quit
she
is
that
sort
cherry
malotte
stirred
and
shifted
her
gaze
uncertainly
to
the
gleaming
bay
abreast
of
them
the
fleet
of
were
drifting
with
the
tide
in
the
distance
others
were
dotted
clear
away
to
where
the
opal
ocean
lay
a
tug
was
passing
and
she
saw
the
sun
flash
from
the
cargo
in
its
tow
while
the
faint
echo
of
a
song
came
wafting
to
her
ears
she
stood
so
for
a
long
moment
fighting
manfully
with
herself
then
wheeled
upon
him
suddenly
there
was
a
new
tone
in
her
voice
as
she
said
if
you
will
let
me
have
one
of
your
launches
i
may
be
able
to
help
you
how
he
demanded
quickly
never
mind
how
it
a
long
chance
and
hardly
worth
trying
but
may
i
take
the
boat
certainly
said
he
there
one
lying
at
the
dock
he
led
her
to
the
shore
and
saw
her
aboard
then
waved
and
walked
moodily
back
to
the
office
gratified
that
she
should
try
to
help
him
yet
certain
that
she
could
not
succeed
where
he
and
george
had
failed
fingerless
fraser
had
breakfasted
late
as
was
his
luxurious
custom
and
shortly
before
noon
in
the
course
of
his
dissatisfied
meanderings
he
found
his
friend
in
the
office
lost
in
sombre
thought
it
was
the
first
time
in
many
weeks
that
he
had
seen
this
mood
in
boyd
and
after
a
fruitless
effort
to
make
him
talk
he
fell
into
his
old
habit
of
imaginary
reading
droning
away
to
himself
as
if
from
a
printed
page
stay
among
us
has
not
been
very
pleasant
has
it
emerson
inquired
so
that
you
could
notice
it
replied
our
hero
do
like
fish
and
i
never
did
is
the
result
of
prejudice
the
fish
is
a
noble
animal
emerson
declared
not
an
animal
at
all
our
hero
gently
corrected
a
biped
a
regular
wild
biped
without
either
love
of
home
or
affection
for
his
children
the
salmon
is
of
a
low
order
of
intelligence
and
has
a
queen
anne
slant
to
his
roof
no
person
with
a
retreating
forehead
like
that
knows
very
much
the
only
other
member
of
the
animal
kingdom
that
is
as
foolish
as
the
salmon
is
alton
clyde
the
fish
has
got
a
shade
the
best
of
it
over
him
but
as
for
friendship
and
the
gentler
emotions
why
the
salmon
has
got
them
at
all
the
only
thing
he
got
is
a
million
eggs
and
a
sense
of
direction
if
he
had
a
spark
of
intelligence
lay
one
egg
a
year
like
a
hen
and
thus
live
for
a
million
years
but
does
he
not
on
your
sarony
he
a
spendthrift
and
turns
his
eggs
loose
a
hatful
at
a
time
he
worse
than
a
shotgun
and
then
too
he
as
clannish
as
a
harvard
graduate
and
do
associate
with
nobody
out
of
his
own
set
no
sir
give
me
a
animal
that
suckles
its
young
i
take
a
farmer
every
time
are
points
i
had
never
considered
said
emerson
every
business
has
its
drawbacks
you
agree
if
i
have
failed
as
a
host
what
can
i
do
to
entertain
you
while
you
grace
our
midst
can
do
most
anything
remarked
his
handsome
companion
can
climb
a
tree
or
do
anything
except
fish
all
the
time
it
is
a
dark
night
without
and
i
fear
some
mischief
is
afoot
but
yonder
beautcheous
gel
roused
by
the
familiarity
of
these
lines
emerson
looked
up
from
his
preoccupation
and
smiled
at
fraser
serious
pantomime
am
i
as
bad
as
all
that
he
inquired
with
an
effort
at
pleasantry
you
worse
bo
i
guess
you
did
know
i
was
here
eh
no
what
about
that
gel
and
the
mischief
that
is
afoot
what
is
the
rest
of
the
story
i
do
know
i
never
got
past
that
place
say
if
i
had
time
bet
i
could
write
a
good
book
i
got
plenty
to
say
why
do
you
try
it
too
busy
yawned
the
adventurer
lazily
gee
this
is
a
lonesome
burg
kalvik
is
sure
out
in
the
tall
grass
ai
it
i
feel
as
if
like
to
break
a
pane
of
glass
let
start
something
i
do
find
it
particularly
dull
at
the
present
moment
boyd
rose
and
began
to
pace
the
room
oh
i
heard
all
about
your
trouble
i
just
left
the
the
what
the
clyde
joint
ai
he
a
calamity
in
what
way
is
there
any
way
in
which
he
ai
you
do
like
him
do
you
no
i
do
declared
fingerless
fraser
stoutly
and
what
more
i
glad
i
do
like
him
because
if
i
liked
him
i
associate
with
him
and
i
hate
him
what
the
matter
well
i
like
silence
and
quietude
i
a
fool
about
my
quiet
but
clyde
he
paused
as
if
in
search
for
suitable
expression
well
whenever
i
try
to
say
anything
he
interrupts
me
after
another
pause
he
went
on
he
dead
sore
on
this
place
too
and
whines
around
like
a
litter
of
pups
he
says
he
was
misled
into
coming
up
here
and
has
a
hunch
he
going
to
lose
his
last
night
episode
frightened
him
i
dare
say
yes
ever
since
he
got
that
wallop
on
the
burr
in
seattle
a
guinea
pig
could
lick
him
hand
to
hand
you
think
that
ten
thou
he
put
up
was
all
the
wealth
of
the
inkers
the
wealth
of
what
inkers
that
a
tribe
of
rich
mexicans
however
i
suppose
i
hang
to
my
coin
the
same
way
he
does
if
i
had
a
mayonnaise
head
like
his
he
an
awful
shine
as
a
so
he
homesick
eh
sure
offered
to
sell
me
his
stock
fraser
threw
back
his
head
and
gave
vent
to
one
of
his
rare
laughs
ai
that
a
rave
here
he
comes
now
boyd
announced
with
a
glance
out
the
window
and
the
next
instant
alton
clyde
entered
a
picture
of
dejection
gee
this
is
fierce
is
it
the
began
flinging
himself
into
the
nearest
chair
they
tell
me
it
all
off
finally
what
are
you
going
to
do
put
up
what
fish
i
can
with
a
short
crew
said
boyd
we
lose
a
lot
of
money
probably
clyde
tone
was
querulous
as
he
continued
i
sorry
i
ever
went
into
this
thing
you
bet
if
i
had
known
as
much
in
chicago
as
i
know
now
i
would
have
hung
on
to
my
money
and
stayed
at
home
you
knew
as
much
as
we
did
boyd
declared
curtly
oh
it
all
right
for
you
to
talk
you
have
risked
any
coin
in
the
deal
but
i
a
rotten
businessman
and
i
never
make
my
ante
back
again
if
i
lose
it
do
whine
about
it
said
boyd
stiffly
you
can
at
least
be
game
and
lose
like
a
man
then
we
going
to
lose
eh
queried
clyde
in
a
scared
voice
i
thought
maybe
you
had
a
plan
look
here
he
began
an
instant
later
cherry
pulled
us
out
once
before
why
do
you
let
her
see
what
she
can
do
with
marsh
boyd
scanned
the
speaker
face
sharply
before
speaking
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
mean
she
can
work
him
if
she
tries
the
same
way
she
worked
hilliard
marsh
is
in
the
mood
to
listen
to
arguments
i
have
tried
that
who
said
anything
about
arguments
you
know
what
i
mean
i
do
care
to
listen
to
that
sort
of
talk
why
not
i
entitled
to
have
my
say
in
things
clyde
was
growing
indignant
i
put
in
ten
thousand
of
my
own
money
and
thousand
besides
on
your
assurances
that
thousand
more
than
you
put
up
nevertheless
it
does
give
you
the
right
to
insult
the
girl
insult
her
bah
you
no
fool
boyd
why
did
hilliard
advance
that
loan
because
he
wanted
to
i
dare
say
what
the
use
of
keeping
that
up
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
she
worked
him
and
worked
him
well
she
do
it
again
if
you
asked
her
she
do
anything
for
you
boyd
broke
out
roughly
i
tell
you
i
heard
enough
of
that
talk
alton
anybody
but
an
idiot
would
know
that
cherry
is
far
too
good
for
what
you
suggest
and
when
you
insult
her
you
insult
me
oh
she
enough
said
clyde
they
all
good
but
not
perhaps
in
the
way
you
mean
how
do
you
know
do
know
but
fraser
does
he
known
her
for
years
you
fraser
but
the
adventurer
face
was
like
wood
as
they
turned
toward
him
i
do
know
nothing
replied
fingerless
fraser
with
an
admirable
show
of
ignorance
well
judge
for
yourself
clyde
turned
again
to
emerson
who
is
she
where
did
she
come
from
what
is
she
doing
here
alone
answer
that
now
she
interested
in
this
deal
just
as
much
as
any
of
us
and
if
you
do
ask
her
to
take
a
hand
i
going
to
put
it
up
to
her
myself
you
do
nothing
of
the
sort
boyd
cried
savagely
clyde
rose
hastily
and
his
voice
was
shaking
with
excitement
as
he
stammered
see
here
boyd
you
to
blame
for
this
trouble
and
now
you
either
get
us
out
of
it
or
buy
my
stock
you
know
that
i
ca
buy
your
stock
then
i
sell
wherever
i
can
i
been
stung
and
i
want
my
money
only
remember
i
offered
the
stock
to
you
first
you
got
a
swell
chance
to
make
a
turn
in
kalvik
said
fraser
why
do
you
take
it
to
marsh
i
will
declared
alton
you
would
do
a
trick
like
that
emerson
questioned
quickly
why
not
you
wo
listen
to
my
advice
you
playing
with
other
people
money
and
it
does
matter
to
you
whether
you
win
or
lose
if
this
enterprise
fails
i
suppose
you
can
promote
another
get
out
boyd
ordered
in
such
a
tone
that
the
speaker
obeyed
with
ludicrous
haste
fingerless
fraser
broke
the
silence
that
fell
upon
the
young
exit
he
a
nice
little
feller
i
never
knew
one
of
those
that
was
on
the
level
he
got
eighteen
fancy
vests
and
wears
a
handkerchief
up
his
sleeve
that
put
him
in
the
end
book
with
me
to
start
with
did
you
know
cherry
before
you
came
to
kalvik
boyd
asked
searching
his
companion
face
with
a
look
the
man
could
not
evade
only
casual
where
nome
the
year
of
the
big
rush
during
the
mining
troubles
eh
sure
what
was
she
doing
minding
her
business
she
good
at
that
fraser
eyes
had
become
green
and
fishy
as
usual
what
do
you
know
about
her
well
i
know
that
a
lot
of
fellows
would
through
for
her
at
the
drop
of
a
hat
she
could
have
most
anything
they
got
i
guess
most
any
of
them
miners
at
nome
would
give
his
right
eye
or
his
only
child
or
any
little
thing
like
that
if
she
asked
it
what
else
well
she
was
always
considered
a
right
party
yes
yes
of
course
but
what
do
you
know
about
the
girl
herself
who
is
she
what
is
her
history
now
sir
i
an
awful
poor
detective
confessed
fingerless
fraser
i
often
noticed
that
about
myself
if
i
was
the
kind
that
goes
snooping
around
into
other
people
business
listening
to
all
the
gossip
i
told
i
make
a
good
witness
but
i
ai
no
sir
i
a
rotten
witness
despite
this
indirect
rebuke
boyd
might
have
continued
his
questioning
had
not
george
balt
heavy
step
sounded
outside
a
moment
later
the
big
fellow
entered
what
did
you
find
at
the
traps
asked
emerson
eagerly
nothing
george
spoke
shortly
the
fish
struck
in
this
morning
but
our
trap
is
corked
he
wrenched
off
his
rubber
boots
and
flung
them
savagely
under
a
bench
what
luck
with
the
boats
not
much
marsh
men
are
trying
to
surround
our
and
we
ai
got
enough
boats
to
protect
ourselves
he
looked
up
meaningly
from
under
his
heavy
brows
and
inquired
how
much
longer
are
we
going
to
stand
for
this
what
do
you
mean
i
got
men
out
hunting
for
new
hands
you
know
what
i
mean
the
giant
rumbled
his
red
eyes
flaming
you
and
i
can
get
willis
marsh
emerson
shot
a
quick
glance
at
fraser
who
was
staring
fixedly
at
big
george
he
got
us
right
enough
and
it
bound
to
come
to
a
killing
some
day
so
the
sooner
the
better
the
fisherman
ran
on
we
can
get
him
if
you
say
so
are
you
in
on
it
boyd
faced
the
window
slowly
while
the
others
followed
him
with
anxious
eyes
inside
the
room
a
silence
settled
in
the
distance
they
heard
the
sound
of
the
canning
machinery
a
sound
that
was
now
a
mockery
to
balt
this
last
disaster
was
the
culmination
of
a
persecution
so
pitiless
and
unflagging
that
its
very
memory
filled
his
simple
mind
with
the
fury
of
a
goaded
animal
to
his
companion
it
meant
almost
certainly
the
loss
of
mildred
wayland
the
girl
who
stood
for
his
pride
in
himself
and
all
that
he
held
most
desirable
he
thought
bitterly
of
all
the
suffering
and
hardship
the
hunger
of
body
and
soul
that
he
had
endured
for
her
sake
again
he
saw
his
hopes
crumbling
and
his
dreams
about
to
fade
once
more
he
felt
his
foothold
giving
way
beneath
him
as
it
had
done
so
often
in
the
past
and
he
was
filled
with
sullen
hate
something
told
him
that
he
would
never
have
the
heart
to
try
again
and
the
thought
left
him
cold
with
rage
ever
since
those
fishermen
had
walked
out
on
the
evening
before
he
had
clung
to
the
feeble
hope
that
once
the
run
began
in
earnest
trap
would
fill
and
save
the
situation
but
now
that
the
salmon
had
struck
in
and
the
trap
was
useless
his
discouragement
was
complete
for
there
were
no
idle
men
in
kalvik
and
there
was
no
way
of
getting
help
moreover
mildred
wayland
was
soon
to
arrive
the
yacht
was
expected
daily
and
she
would
find
him
a
failure
what
was
worse
she
would
find
that
marsh
had
vanquished
him
she
had
kept
her
faith
in
him
he
reflected
but
a
woman
faith
could
hardly
survive
humiliation
and
it
was
not
in
human
nature
to
lean
forever
upon
a
broken
reed
she
would
turn
elsewhere
perhaps
to
the
very
man
who
had
contrived
his
undoing
at
thought
of
this
a
sort
of
desperation
seemed
to
master
him
he
began
to
mutter
aloud
what
did
you
say
queried
balt
i
said
that
you
are
right
the
time
is
close
at
hand
for
some
sort
of
a
reckoning
answered
boyd
in
a
harsh
strained
voice
good
emerson
was
upon
the
point
of
turning
when
his
eyes
fell
upon
a
picture
that
made
him
start
then
gaze
more
intently
out
upon
the
placid
waters
abreast
of
the
plant
the
launch
in
which
cherry
had
departed
was
approaching
and
it
was
loaded
down
with
men
not
only
were
they
crowded
upon
the
craft
itself
but
trailing
behind
it
like
the
tail
of
a
kite
was
a
long
line
of
canoes
and
these
also
were
peopled
look
yonder
cried
boyd
what
cherry
has
got
a
crew
his
voice
broke
and
he
bolted
toward
the
door
as
big
george
leaped
to
the
window
injuns
by
god
shouted
the
giant
and
without
stopping
to
stamp
his
feet
into
his
boots
he
rushed
out
barefoot
after
boyd
and
fraser
together
the
three
men
reached
the
dock
in
time
to
help
cherry
up
the
ladder
what
does
this
mean
boyd
asked
her
breathlessly
will
these
fellows
work
that
what
they
here
for
said
the
girl
after
her
swarmed
a
crowd
of
aleuts
those
in
the
kyaks
astern
cast
off
and
paddled
toward
the
beach
i
got
fifty
men
the
best
on
the
river
i
tried
to
get
more
but
there
are
any
more
fingerless
fraser
slapped
himself
resoundingly
upon
the
thigh
and
exploded
profanely
boyd
seized
the
girl
hands
in
his
and
wrung
them
cherry
you
a
treasure
the
memory
of
his
desperate
resolution
of
a
moment
before
swept
over
him
suddenly
and
his
voice
trembled
with
a
great
thankfulness
do
thank
me
cherry
exclaimed
it
was
more
constantine
work
than
mine
but
i
do
understand
these
are
marsh
men
to
be
sure
but
i
was
good
to
them
when
they
were
hungry
last
winter
and
i
prevailed
upon
them
to
come
they
are
very
good
fishermen
they
awfully
lazy
and
they
wo
work
half
as
hard
as
white
men
but
it
the
best
i
could
do
she
laughed
gladly
more
than
repaid
by
the
look
in
her
companion
face
now
get
me
some
lunch
i
fairly
starved
big
george
when
he
had
fully
grasped
the
situation
became
the
boss
fisherman
on
the
instant
before
the
others
had
reached
the
he
was
busied
in
laying
out
his
crews
and
distributing
his
gear
the
impossible
had
happened
victory
was
in
sight
the
fish
were
running
he
cared
to
know
no
more
that
night
the
floors
of
the
groaned
beneath
a
weight
of
salmon
piled
to
a
tall
man
all
through
the
cool
hours
the
ranks
of
chinese
butchers
hacked
and
slit
and
slashed
with
swift
sure
tireless
strokes
while
the
great
building
echoed
hollowly
to
the
clank
of
machines
and
the
hissing
sighs
of
the
chapter
xxiii
in
which
more
plans
are
laid
it
seemed
to
boyd
that
he
had
never
felt
such
elation
as
during
the
days
that
followed
he
trod
upon
air
his
head
was
in
the
clouds
he
joked
with
his
men
inspiring
them
with
his
own
and
untiring
energy
he
was
never
idle
save
during
the
odd
hours
that
he
snatched
for
sleep
he
covered
the
plant
from
top
to
bottom
and
no
wheel
stopped
turning
no
mechanical
device
gave
way
without
his
instant
attention
so
urgent
was
he
that
george
balt
became
desperate
for
the
indians
were
not
like
white
men
and
proved
a
sad
trial
to
the
big
fellow
who
was
accustomed
to
drive
his
crews
with
the
cruelty
of
a
convict
foreman
despite
his
utmost
endeavors
he
could
not
keep
the
plant
running
to
capacity
and
in
his
zeal
he
took
the
blame
wholly
upon
himself
while
the
daily
output
was
disappointing
emerson
drew
consolation
from
the
prospect
that
his
pack
would
be
large
enough
at
least
to
avert
utter
ruin
and
he
argued
that
once
he
had
won
through
this
first
season
no
power
that
marsh
could
bring
to
bear
would
serve
to
crush
him
he
saw
a
moderate
success
ahead
if
not
the
overwhelming
victory
upon
which
he
had
counted
up
at
the
trust
headquarters
willis
marsh
was
in
a
fine
fury
as
far
as
possible
his
subordinates
avoided
him
his
superintendents
summoned
from
their
work
emerged
from
the
office
on
the
hill
with
dampened
brows
and
frightened
glances
over
their
shoulders
many
of
them
held
their
places
through
services
that
did
not
show
upon
the
company
books
but
now
they
shook
their
heads
and
swore
that
some
things
were
beyond
them
except
for
one
step
on
emerson
part
marsh
would
have
rested
secure
and
let
time
work
out
his
enemy
downfall
but
boyd
precaution
in
contracting
to
sell
his
output
in
advance
threatened
to
defeat
him
otherwise
marsh
would
simply
have
cut
down
his
rival
catch
to
the
lowest
point
and
then
broken
the
market
in
the
fall
with
the
tremendous
resources
back
of
him
he
could
have
afforded
to
hammer
down
the
price
of
fish
to
a
point
where
emerson
would
either
have
been
ruined
or
forced
to
carry
his
pack
for
a
year
and
in
this
course
he
would
have
been
upheld
by
wayne
wayland
but
as
matters
stood
such
tactics
could
only
result
in
a
serious
loss
to
the
brokers
who
had
agreed
to
take
boyd
catch
and
to
the
trust
itself
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
work
the
young
man
undoing
here
and
now
marsh
knew
that
he
had
already
wasted
too
much
time
in
kalvik
for
he
was
needed
at
other
points
far
to
the
southward
but
he
could
not
bear
to
leave
this
fight
to
other
hands
moreover
he
was
anxiously
awaiting
the
arrival
of
grande
dame
with
mildred
and
her
father
one
square
of
the
calendar
over
his
desk
was
marked
in
red
and
the
sight
of
it
gave
him
fresh
determination
on
the
third
day
after
boyd
deliverance
constantine
sought
him
out
in
company
with
several
of
the
native
fishermen
translating
their
demand
to
be
paid
for
the
fish
they
had
caught
ca
they
wait
until
the
end
of
the
week
emerson
inquired
no
they
got
no
money
they
got
no
grub
they
say
little
baby
is
hongry
and
they
like
money
now
so
soon
they
buy
grub
they
work
some
more
very
well
here
an
order
on
the
boyd
tore
a
leaf
from
his
and
wrote
a
few
words
on
it
telling
the
men
to
present
it
at
the
office
as
constantine
was
about
to
leave
he
called
to
him
wait
i
want
to
talk
with
you
the
breed
halted
how
long
have
you
known
mr
marsh
me
know
him
long
time
do
you
like
him
a
flicker
ran
over
the
fellow
coppery
face
as
he
replied
yes
him
good
man
you
used
to
work
for
him
did
you
not
yes
why
did
you
quit
constantine
hesitated
slightly
before
answering
me
go
work
for
cherry
why
she
good
to
my
little
broder
you
savvy
little
so
big
yes
i
seen
him
he
a
fine
little
fellow
by
the
way
do
you
remember
that
night
about
two
weeks
ago
when
i
was
at
house
the
night
you
and
your
sister
went
out
i
where
did
you
go
constantine
shifted
his
boots
what
for
you
ask
never
mind
where
did
you
go
when
you
left
the
house
me
go
indian
village
what
for
you
ask
nothing
only
if
you
ever
have
any
trouble
with
marsh
i
may
be
able
to
help
you
i
like
you
and
i
do
like
him
the
breed
grunted
unintelligibly
and
was
about
to
leave
when
boyd
reached
forth
suddenly
and
plucked
the
fellow
from
its
scabbard
with
a
startled
cry
constantine
whirled
his
face
convulsed
his
nostrils
dilated
like
those
of
a
frightened
horse
but
emerson
merely
fingered
the
weapon
carelessly
remarking
that
is
a
curious
knife
you
have
i
have
noticed
it
several
times
he
eyed
him
shrewdly
for
a
moment
then
handed
the
blade
back
with
a
smile
constantine
slipped
it
into
its
place
and
strode
away
without
a
word
it
was
considerably
later
in
the
day
when
boyd
discovered
the
indians
to
whom
he
had
given
the
note
talking
excitedly
on
the
dock
seeing
constantine
in
argument
with
them
he
approached
to
demand
an
explanation
whereupon
the
held
out
a
silver
dollar
in
his
palm
with
the
words
these
men
say
this
money
no
good
what
do
you
mean
it
no
good
no
can
buy
grub
at
company
store
boyd
saw
that
the
group
was
eying
him
suspiciously
nonsense
what
the
matter
with
it
storekeeper
laugh
and
say
it
come
from
you
he
say
take
it
back
he
no
sell
my
people
any
flour
it
was
evident
that
even
constantine
was
vaguely
distrustful
another
native
extended
a
coin
saying
we
want
money
like
this
boyd
took
the
piece
and
examined
it
whereupon
a
light
broke
upon
him
the
coin
was
stamped
with
the
initials
of
one
of
the
old
fishing
companies
and
he
instantly
recognized
a
ruse
practiced
in
the
north
during
the
days
of
the
first
trading
concerns
it
had
been
the
custom
of
these
companies
to
pay
their
indians
in
coins
bearing
their
own
impress
and
to
refuse
all
other
specie
at
their
posts
thus
compelling
the
natives
to
trade
at
company
stores
by
carefully
building
up
this
system
they
had
obtained
a
monopoly
of
indian
labor
and
it
was
evident
that
marsh
and
his
associates
had
robbed
the
aleuts
in
the
same
manner
during
the
days
before
the
consolidation
boyd
saw
at
once
the
cause
of
the
difficulty
and
undertook
to
explain
it
but
he
had
small
success
for
the
indians
had
learned
a
hard
lesson
and
were
loath
to
put
confidence
in
the
white
man
promises
seeing
that
his
words
carried
no
conviction
emerson
gave
up
at
last
saying
if
the
company
store
wo
take
this
money
i
sell
you
whatever
you
need
from
the
commissary
we
are
not
going
to
have
any
trouble
over
a
little
thing
like
this
he
marched
the
natives
in
a
body
to
the
storehouse
where
he
saw
to
it
that
they
received
what
provisions
they
needed
and
assisted
them
in
loading
their
canoes
but
his
amusement
at
the
episode
gave
way
to
uneasiness
on
the
following
morning
when
the
aleuts
failed
to
report
for
work
and
by
noon
his
anxiety
resolved
itself
into
strong
suspicion
balt
had
returned
from
the
banks
earlier
in
the
morning
with
news
of
a
struggle
between
his
white
crew
and
marsh
men
george
boats
had
been
surrounded
during
the
night
nets
had
been
cut
and
several
encounters
had
occurred
resulting
in
serious
injury
to
his
men
the
giant
in
no
amiable
mood
had
returned
for
reinforcements
stating
that
the
situation
was
becoming
more
serious
every
hour
hearing
of
the
desertion
of
the
natives
he
burst
into
profanity
then
armed
himself
and
returned
to
the
banks
while
boyd
now
thoroughly
alarmed
took
a
launch
and
sped
up
the
river
to
cherry
house
in
the
hope
that
she
could
prevail
upon
her
own
recruits
to
return
he
found
the
girl
ready
to
accompany
him
and
they
were
about
to
embark
when
chakawana
came
running
from
the
house
as
if
in
sudden
fright
where
you
go
she
asked
her
mistress
i
am
going
to
the
indian
village
you
stay
here
no
no
i
no
stop
here
alone
i
go
too
she
cast
a
glance
over
her
shoulder
but
chakawana
what
is
the
matter
are
you
afraid
yes
chakawana
nodded
her
pretty
head
vigorously
what
are
you
afraid
of
boyd
asked
but
she
merely
stared
at
him
with
eyes
as
black
and
round
as
cherries
then
renewed
her
entreaty
when
she
had
received
permission
and
had
hurried
back
to
the
house
her
mistress
remarked
with
a
puzzled
frown
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
her
she
and
constantine
have
been
acting
very
strangely
of
late
she
used
to
be
the
happiest
sort
of
creature
always
laughing
and
singing
but
she
has
changed
entirely
during
the
last
few
weeks
both
she
and
constantine
are
forever
whispering
to
each
other
and
skulking
about
until
i
am
getting
nervous
myself
then
as
the
indian
girl
came
flying
back
with
her
tiny
baby
brother
in
her
arms
cherry
added
she
pretty
is
she
i
ca
bear
ugly
people
around
me
at
the
native
village
in
spite
of
every
effort
she
and
boyd
could
make
the
indians
refused
to
go
back
to
work
many
of
them
so
they
learned
had
already
reported
to
the
other
canneries
evidently
still
doubtful
of
emerson
assurances
and
afraid
to
run
the
risk
of
offending
their
old
employers
those
who
were
left
were
lazy
fellows
who
did
not
care
to
work
under
any
circumstances
these
merely
listened
then
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
walked
away
since
they
ca
use
your
money
at
the
store
they
do
seem
to
care
whether
it
is
good
or
not
cherry
announced
after
a
time
i
give
them
enough
provisions
to
last
them
all
winter
boyd
offered
irritated
beyond
measure
at
such
stupidity
tell
them
to
move
the
whole
blamed
village
down
to
my
place
women
and
all
i
take
care
of
them
but
after
an
hour
of
futile
cajolery
he
was
forced
to
give
up
realizing
that
marsh
had
been
at
work
again
frightening
these
simple
people
by
threats
of
vengeance
and
starvation
you
ca
blame
the
poor
things
they
have
learned
to
fear
the
hand
of
the
companies
and
to
know
that
they
are
absolutely
dependent
upon
the
cannery
stores
during
the
winter
but
it
maddening
she
stamped
her
foot
angrily
and
i
was
so
proud
of
my
work
i
thought
i
had
really
done
something
to
help
at
last
but
i
do
know
what
more
we
can
do
i
reached
the
end
of
my
rope
so
have
i
he
confessed
even
with
those
fifty
aleuts
we
running
at
more
than
half
capacity
but
we
were
making
a
showing
at
least
now
he
flung
up
his
hands
in
a
gesture
of
despair
george
is
in
trouble
as
usual
marsh
men
have
cut
our
nets
and
the
yacht
may
arrive
at
any
time
the
yacht
what
yacht
wayland
yacht
he
is
making
a
tour
of
this
coast
with
the
other
officers
of
the
trust
and
mildred
is
is
she
coming
here
demanded
cherry
in
a
strained
voice
yes
why
did
you
tell
me
i
do
know
i
did
think
you
would
be
interested
so
she
ca
wait
she
is
so
eager
that
she
follows
you
from
chicago
clear
up
into
this
wilderness
then
you
wo
need
my
assistance
any
more
will
you
her
lids
drooped
half
hiding
her
eyes
and
her
face
hardened
of
course
i
shall
need
your
help
her
coming
wo
make
any
difference
it
strikes
me
that
you
have
allowed
me
to
make
a
fool
of
myself
long
enough
said
cherry
angrily
here
i
have
been
breaking
my
heart
over
this
enterprise
while
you
have
known
all
the
time
that
she
was
coming
why
you
have
merely
used
me
and
george
and
all
the
rest
of
us
for
that
matter
she
laughed
harshly
you
do
understand
said
boyd
miss
wayland
oh
yes
i
do
i
dare
say
it
will
gratify
her
to
straighten
out
your
troubles
a
word
from
her
lips
and
your
worries
will
vanish
like
a
mist
let
us
acknowledge
ourselves
beaten
and
beg
her
to
save
us
boyd
shook
his
head
in
negation
but
she
gave
him
no
time
for
speech
it
seems
that
you
wanted
to
pose
as
a
hero
before
her
and
employed
us
to
build
up
your
triumph
well
i
am
glad
we
failed
i
glad
willis
marsh
showed
you
how
very
helpless
you
are
let
her
come
to
your
rescue
now
i
through
do
you
understand
i
through
emerson
gazed
at
her
in
astonishment
the
outburst
had
been
so
unexpected
but
he
realized
that
he
owed
her
too
much
to
take
offence
miss
wayland
will
take
no
hand
in
my
affairs
i
doubt
if
she
will
even
realize
what
this
trouble
is
all
about
he
said
a
trifle
stiffly
i
suppose
i
did
want
to
play
the
hero
and
i
dare
say
i
did
use
you
and
the
others
but
you
knew
that
all
the
time
why
wo
she
help
you
queried
cherry
does
she
care
enough
about
you
does
she
know
enough
to
understand
your
plight
yes
but
this
is
my
fight
and
i
got
to
make
good
without
her
assistance
she
is
the
sort
to
marry
a
failure
and
she
has
left
me
to
make
my
own
way
besides
she
would
not
dare
go
contrary
to
her
father
wishes
even
if
she
desired
that
is
part
of
her
education
oh
wayne
wayland
opposition
is
all
i
have
had
to
overcome
i
have
had
to
show
his
daughter
that
i
am
one
of
her
own
kind
for
she
hates
weakness
and
you
think
that
woman
loves
you
why
she
is
a
woman
at
all
she
does
know
what
love
means
when
a
woman
loves
do
you
imagine
she
cares
for
money
or
fame
or
success
if
i
cared
for
a
man
do
you
think
i
stop
to
ask
my
father
if
i
might
marry
him
or
wait
for
my
lover
to
prove
himself
worthy
of
me
do
you
think
i
send
him
through
the
hell
you
have
suffered
to
try
his
metal
she
laughed
outright
why
become
what
he
was
and
i
fight
with
him
i
give
him
all
i
had
money
position
friends
influence
if
my
people
objected
tell
them
to
go
hang
i
give
them
up
and
join
him
i
use
every
dollar
every
wile
and
feminine
device
that
i
possessed
in
his
service
when
a
woman
loves
she
does
care
what
the
world
says
the
man
may
be
a
weakling
or
worse
but
he
is
still
her
lover
and
she
will
go
to
him
the
words
had
come
tumbling
forth
until
cherry
was
forced
to
pause
for
breath
you
do
understand
said
boyd
you
are
primitive
you
have
lived
in
the
open
she
is
exactly
your
opposite
conservatism
is
bred
in
her
and
she
ca
help
her
nature
it
was
hard
even
for
me
to
understand
at
first
but
when
i
saw
her
life
when
i
saw
how
she
had
been
reared
from
childhood
i
understood
perfectly
i
would
not
have
her
other
than
she
is
it
is
enough
for
me
to
know
that
in
her
own
way
she
cares
for
me
cherry
tossed
her
head
in
derision
for
my
part
i
prefer
red
blood
to
sap
and
when
i
love
i
want
to
know
it
i
do
want
to
have
it
proved
to
me
like
a
problem
in
geometry
i
want
to
love
and
hate
and
do
wild
impulsive
things
against
my
own
judgment
have
you
ever
loved
in
that
way
he
inquired
abruptly
yes
she
answered
without
hesitation
looking
him
squarely
in
the
eye
with
an
expression
he
could
not
fathom
thank
heaven
i
not
the
artificial
kind
as
you
say
i
primitive
i
have
lived
her
crimson
lips
curled
scornfully
i
did
expect
you
to
understand
her
he
said
but
she
loves
me
and
i
well
she
is
my
religion
a
man
must
have
some
god
he
worship
his
own
image
cherry
malotte
turned
slowly
to
the
and
made
her
way
into
the
launch
all
the
way
back
she
kept
silence
and
boyd
confused
by
her
attack
upon
the
citadel
of
his
faith
and
strangely
sore
at
heart
made
no
effort
at
speech
fingerless
fraser
met
him
at
the
water
edge
where
in
the
devil
have
you
been
he
cried
breathlessly
at
the
indian
village
after
help
why
big
george
is
in
more
trouble
he
sent
for
help
two
hours
ago
i
was
just
going
to
it
down
there
what
up
there
six
of
your
men
in
the
all
beat
up
they
do
look
like
they
fish
any
more
for
a
while
marsh
men
threw
their
salmon
overboard
and
they
had
another
fight
things
are
getting
warm
we
ca
allow
ourselves
to
be
driven
from
the
banks
said
boyd
quickly
i
get
the
shoremen
together
right
away
find
alton
and
bring
him
along
we
need
every
man
we
can
get
nothing
doing
with
that
party
he
quit
like
a
house
cat
and
gone
to
bed
very
well
he
no
good
anyhow
he
better
out
of
the
way
he
hurried
through
the
building
now
silent
and
half
deserted
gathering
a
crew
then
leaving
only
the
orientals
and
the
watchman
to
guard
the
plant
he
loaded
his
men
into
the
boats
and
set
out
all
that
afternoon
and
on
through
the
long
murky
hours
of
the
night
the
battle
raged
on
the
lower
reaches
of
the
kalvik
boat
crews
clashed
men
cursed
each
other
and
fought
with
naked
fists
with
oars
and
clubs
and
when
these
failed
they
drove
at
one
another
with
wicked
fish
pues
all
night
the
hordes
of
salmon
swarmed
upward
toward
the
fatal
waters
of
their
birth
through
sagging
nets
that
were
torn
and
slit
beneath
keels
that
rocked
to
the
impact
of
struggling
heedless
bodies
chapter
xxiv
wherein
the
grande
dame
arrives
laden
with
disappointments
as
the
sun
slanted
up
between
the
southward
hills
out
from
the
gossamer
haze
that
lay
like
filmy
forest
smoke
above
the
ocean
came
a
yacht
she
stole
inward
past
the
headlands
as
silent
as
a
wraith
leaving
a
long
black
streamer
penciled
against
the
sky
so
still
was
the
dawn
that
the
breath
from
her
funnel
lay
like
a
trail
behind
her
slowly
fading
and
blending
with
the
colors
of
the
morning
the
waters
were
gleaming
nickel
beneath
her
prow
and
she
clove
them
like
a
blade
against
the
sky
her
slender
rigging
was
traced
as
by
some
finely
pointed
instrument
her
sides
were
as
clean
as
the
stainless
breasts
of
the
gulls
that
floated
near
the
shore
as
she
came
proudly
up
through
the
fleets
of
perfect
in
every
line
and
gliding
with
stately
dignity
the
grimy
little
crafts
drew
aside
as
if
in
awe
while
men
stared
silently
at
her
as
if
at
a
vision
to
boyd
emerson
she
seemed
like
an
angel
of
mercy
and
he
stood
forth
upon
the
deck
of
his
launch
searching
her
hungrily
for
the
sight
of
a
woman
figure
when
he
had
first
seen
the
ship
rounding
the
point
he
had
uttered
a
cry
then
fallen
silent
watching
her
as
she
drew
near
heedless
of
his
surroundings
his
heart
was
leaping
his
breath
was
choking
him
it
seemed
as
if
he
must
shout
mildred
name
aloud
and
stretch
his
arms
out
to
her
of
course
she
would
see
him
as
grande
passed
she
would
be
looking
for
him
he
knew
she
would
be
standing
there
wet
with
the
dew
searching
with
all
her
eyes
doubtless
she
had
waited
patiently
at
her
post
from
the
instant
land
came
into
sight
seized
by
a
sudden
panic
lest
she
pass
him
unnoticed
he
ordered
his
launch
near
the
yacht
course
where
he
could
command
a
view
of
her
cabin
doors
and
the
wicker
chairs
upon
her
deck
his
eyes
roved
over
the
craft
but
all
he
saw
was
a
uniformed
officer
upon
the
bridge
and
the
bronzed
faces
of
the
watch
staring
over
the
rail
by
now
grande
was
so
close
that
he
might
have
flung
a
line
to
her
and
above
the
muffled
throbbing
of
her
engines
he
heard
the
captain
give
some
command
yet
nowhere
could
he
catch
a
glimpse
of
mildred
he
saw
curtains
over
the
cabin
windows
indicating
that
the
passengers
were
still
asleep
then
as
he
stood
there
drooping
with
fatigue
his
wet
body
chilled
by
the
morning
breath
grande
glided
past
and
he
found
the
shell
beneath
his
feet
rocking
in
her
wake
as
he
turned
shoreward
george
balt
hailed
him
and
brought
his
own
launch
alongside
what
craft
is
that
he
inquired
she
is
the
company
yacht
with
the
officers
aboard
the
big
fellow
stared
curiously
after
the
retreating
ship
some
of
our
boys
is
hurt
pretty
bad
he
observed
i
told
them
to
take
in
their
nets
and
go
back
to
the
plant
we
all
need
breakfast
i
do
want
nothing
i
going
over
to
the
trap
emerson
shrugged
his
shoulders
listlessly
he
was
very
tired
what
is
the
use
it
wo
pay
us
to
lift
it
i
watched
that
point
of
land
for
five
years
and
i
never
seen
fish
act
this
way
before
balt
growled
stubbornly
if
they
do
strike
in
we
better
close
down
marsh
men
cut
half
our
nets
and
crippled
more
than
half
our
crew
last
night
he
began
to
rumble
curses
say
we
made
a
mistake
the
other
day
did
we
we
ought
to
have
put
that
feller
away
it
ai
too
late
yet
wait
wayne
wayland
is
aboard
that
yacht
i
know
him
he
a
hard
man
and
i
heard
strange
stories
about
him
but
i
do
believe
he
knows
all
that
marsh
has
been
doing
i
going
to
see
him
and
tell
him
everything
he
turns
you
down
then
there
will
be
time
enough
to
to
consider
what
you
suggest
i
do
like
to
think
about
it
you
do
have
to
said
balt
lowering
his
voice
so
that
the
helmsmen
could
not
hear
i
been
thinking
it
over
all
night
and
it
looks
like
i
ought
to
do
it
myself
marsh
is
coming
to
me
anyhow
and
older
than
you
be
it
ai
right
for
a
young
feller
like
you
to
take
a
chance
if
they
get
me
you
can
run
the
business
alone
boyd
laid
his
hand
on
his
companion
shoulder
no
he
said
perhaps
i
would
stick
at
murder
i
do
know
but
i
wo
profit
by
another
man
crime
and
if
it
comes
to
that
i
take
my
share
of
the
risk
and
the
guilt
whatever
you
do
i
stand
with
you
but
we
hope
for
better
things
it
no
easy
thing
for
me
to
go
to
wayland
asking
a
favor
you
see
his
daughter
is
well
i
i
want
to
see
her
very
badly
balt
eyed
him
shrewdly
i
see
and
that
makes
it
dead
wrong
for
you
to
take
a
hand
if
necessary
to
get
marsh
i
do
it
alone
with
him
out
of
the
way
i
think
you
can
make
a
go
of
it
he
like
a
rattler
somebody
got
to
stomp
on
him
now
i
off
for
the
trap
let
me
know
what
the
old
man
says
boyd
returned
to
the
cannery
with
the
old
mood
of
and
bitterness
heavy
upon
him
he
realized
that
george
offer
to
commit
murder
had
not
shocked
him
as
much
as
upon
its
first
mention
he
knew
that
he
had
thought
of
shedding
human
blood
with
as
little
compunction
as
if
the
intended
victim
had
been
some
noxious
animal
he
felt
indeed
that
if
his
love
for
mildred
made
him
a
criminal
she
too
would
be
soiled
by
his
dishonor
and
for
her
sake
he
shrank
from
the
idea
of
violence
yet
he
lacked
the
energy
at
that
time
to
put
it
from
him
well
he
would
go
to
her
father
humble
himself
and
beg
for
protection
if
he
failed
then
marsh
must
look
out
for
himself
he
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
spare
his
enemy
at
the
plant
he
found
alton
clyde
tremendously
excited
at
the
arrival
of
the
yacht
and
eager
to
visit
his
friends
he
sent
him
to
the
launch
and
after
a
hasty
breakfast
joined
him
on
their
way
out
boyd
felt
a
return
of
that
misgiving
which
had
mastered
him
on
his
first
meeting
with
mildred
in
chicago
for
the
second
time
he
was
bringing
her
failure
instead
of
the
promised
victory
now
as
then
she
would
find
him
in
the
bitterness
of
defeat
and
he
could
not
but
wonder
how
she
would
bear
the
disappointment
he
hoped
at
least
that
she
would
understand
his
appeal
to
her
father
that
she
would
see
him
not
as
a
suppliant
begging
for
mercy
but
as
a
foeman
worthy
of
respect
demanding
his
just
dues
surely
he
had
proved
himself
capable
wayne
wayland
could
hardly
make
him
contemptible
in
mildred
eyes
yet
a
feeling
of
disquiet
came
over
him
as
he
drew
near
grande
willis
marsh
was
ahead
of
him
standing
with
wayland
at
the
rail
some
one
else
was
with
them
boyd
heart
leaped
wildly
as
he
recognized
her
he
would
have
known
that
slim
figure
anywhere
and
mildred
saw
him
too
pointing
him
out
to
her
companions
with
knees
shaking
under
him
he
came
stumbling
up
the
a
tall
gaunt
figure
of
a
man
in
rough
clothing
and
boots
stained
with
the
sea
salt
he
looked
older
by
five
years
than
when
the
girl
had
last
seen
him
his
cheeks
were
hollowed
and
his
lips
cracked
by
the
wind
but
his
eyes
were
aflame
with
the
old
light
his
smile
was
for
her
alone
he
never
remembered
the
spoken
greetings
nor
the
looks
the
others
gave
him
for
her
soft
cool
hands
lay
in
his
hard
feverish
palms
and
she
was
smiling
up
at
him
alton
clyde
was
at
his
heels
and
he
felt
mildred
disengage
her
hand
he
tore
his
eyes
away
from
her
face
long
enough
to
nod
at
marsh
who
gave
him
a
menacing
look
then
turned
to
wayne
wayland
the
old
man
was
saying
something
and
boyd
answered
him
unintelligibly
after
which
he
took
mildred
hands
once
more
with
such
an
air
of
unconscious
proprietorship
that
willis
marsh
grew
pale
to
the
lips
and
turned
his
back
other
people
whom
boyd
had
not
noticed
until
now
came
down
the
deck
men
and
women
with
and
cameras
swung
over
their
shoulders
he
found
that
he
was
being
introduced
to
them
by
mildred
whose
voice
betrayed
no
tremor
and
whose
manners
were
as
collected
as
if
this
were
her
own
and
the
man
at
her
side
a
casual
acquaintance
the
strangers
mingled
with
the
little
group
levelled
their
glasses
and
made
senseless
remarks
after
the
manner
of
tourists
the
world
over
boyd
gathered
somehow
that
they
were
officers
of
the
trust
or
heavy
stockholders
and
their
wives
they
seemed
to
accept
him
as
an
uninteresting
bit
of
local
color
and
he
regarded
them
with
equal
indifference
for
his
eyes
were
wholly
occupied
with
mildred
his
ears
deaf
to
all
but
her
voice
at
length
he
saw
some
of
them
going
over
the
rail
and
later
found
himself
alone
with
his
sweetheart
he
led
her
to
a
and
seated
himself
beside
her
at
last
he
breathed
you
are
here
mildred
you
really
came
after
all
yes
boyd
and
are
you
glad
indeed
i
am
the
trip
has
been
wonderful
it
does
seem
possible
i
ca
believe
that
this
is
really
you
that
i
am
not
dreaming
as
usual
and
you
how
have
you
been
i
been
well
i
guess
i
have
i
have
had
time
to
think
of
myself
oh
my
lady
his
voice
broke
with
tenderness
and
he
laid
his
hand
gently
upon
hers
she
withdrew
it
quickly
not
here
remember
where
we
are
you
are
not
looking
well
boyd
i
do
know
that
i
ever
saw
you
look
so
badly
perhaps
it
is
your
clothes
i
am
tired
he
confessed
feeling
anew
the
weariness
of
the
past
hours
he
covertly
stroked
a
fold
of
her
dress
murmuring
you
are
here
after
all
and
you
love
me
mildred
you
changed
have
you
not
at
all
have
you
his
deep
breath
and
the
light
that
flamed
into
his
face
was
her
answer
i
want
to
be
alone
with
you
he
cried
huskily
my
arms
ache
for
you
come
away
from
here
this
is
torture
i
like
a
man
dying
of
thirst
no
woman
could
have
beheld
his
burning
eagerness
without
an
answering
thrill
and
although
mildred
sat
motionless
her
lids
drooped
slightly
and
a
faint
color
tinged
her
cheeks
her
idle
hands
clasped
themselves
rigidly
you
are
always
the
same
she
smiled
you
sweep
me
away
from
myself
and
from
everything
i
have
never
seen
any
one
like
you
there
are
people
everywhere
father
is
somewhere
close
by
i
do
i
do
my
launch
is
alongside
let
me
take
you
ashore
and
show
you
what
i
have
done
i
want
you
to
see
i
ca
i
promised
to
go
ashore
with
the
berrys
and
mr
marsh
marsh
now
do
get
tragic
we
are
all
going
to
look
over
his
plant
and
have
lunch
there
they
are
expecting
me
oh
dear
she
cried
plaintively
i
have
seen
and
heard
nothing
but
canneries
ever
since
we
left
vancouver
the
men
talk
nothing
but
fish
and
packs
and
markets
and
dividends
it
all
deadly
stupid
and
i
wretchedly
tired
of
it
father
is
the
worst
of
the
lot
of
course
emerson
eyes
shifted
to
his
own
cannery
you
have
seen
mine
ours
said
he
oh
yes
i
have
marsh
pointed
it
out
to
father
and
me
it
looks
just
like
all
the
others
there
was
an
instant
pause
before
she
ran
on
do
you
know
there
is
only
one
interesting
feature
about
them
to
my
notion
and
that
is
the
way
the
chinamen
smoke
those
funny
crooked
pipes
and
those
little
wads
of
tobacco
are
too
ridiculous
the
lightness
of
her
words
damped
his
ardor
and
brought
back
the
sense
of
failure
that
formless
huddle
of
buildings
in
the
distance
seemed
to
him
all
at
once
very
dull
and
prosaic
of
course
it
was
just
like
scores
of
others
that
his
sweetheart
had
seen
all
the
way
north
from
the
he
had
never
thought
of
that
till
now
i
was
down
with
the
fishing
fleet
at
the
mouth
of
the
bay
this
morning
when
you
came
in
i
thought
i
might
see
you
he
said
at
that
hour
heavens
i
was
sound
asleep
it
was
hard
enough
to
get
up
when
we
were
called
father
might
have
instructed
the
captain
not
to
steam
so
fast
boyd
stared
at
her
in
hurt
surprise
but
she
was
smiling
at
alton
clyde
in
the
distance
and
did
not
observe
his
look
do
you
care
even
to
hear
what
i
have
done
he
inquired
of
course
said
mildred
bringing
her
eyes
back
to
him
hesitatingly
he
told
her
of
his
disappointments
the
obstacles
he
had
met
and
overcome
avoiding
marsh
name
and
refraining
from
placing
the
blame
where
it
belonged
when
he
had
concluded
she
shook
her
head
it
is
too
bad
but
marsh
told
us
all
about
it
before
you
came
boyd
i
never
thought
well
of
this
enterprise
of
course
i
did
say
anything
against
it
you
were
so
enthusiastic
but
you
really
ought
to
try
something
big
i
am
sure
you
have
the
ability
why
the
successful
men
i
know
at
home
have
no
more
intelligence
than
you
and
they
half
your
force
as
for
this
well
i
think
you
can
accomplish
more
important
things
than
catching
fish
important
he
cried
why
the
salmon
industry
is
one
of
the
most
important
on
the
coast
it
employs
ten
thousand
men
in
alaska
alone
and
they
produce
ten
million
dollars
every
year
oh
let
not
go
into
statistics
said
mildred
lightly
they
make
my
head
ache
what
i
mean
is
that
a
fisherman
is
nothing
like
an
attorney
or
a
broker
or
an
architect
for
instance
he
is
more
like
a
miner
pardon
me
boyd
but
look
at
your
clothes
she
began
to
laugh
why
you
look
like
a
common
laborer
he
became
conscious
for
the
first
time
that
he
cut
a
sorry
figure
everything
around
him
spoke
of
wealth
and
luxury
even
the
sailor
that
passed
at
the
moment
was
better
dressed
than
he
he
felt
suddenly
awkward
and
out
of
place
i
might
have
slicked
up
a
bit
he
acknowledged
lamely
but
when
you
came
i
forgot
everything
else
i
was
dreadfully
embarrassed
when
i
introduced
you
to
the
berrys
and
the
rest
i
dare
say
they
thought
you
were
one
of
marsh
foremen
never
before
had
boyd
known
the
least
constraint
in
mildred
presence
but
now
he
felt
the
rebuke
behind
her
careless
manner
and
it
wounded
him
deeply
he
did
not
speak
and
after
a
moment
she
went
on
with
an
abrupt
change
of
subject
so
that
funny
little
house
over
there
against
the
hill
is
where
the
mysterious
woman
lives
who
cherry
malotte
yes
how
did
you
learn
that
marsh
pointed
it
out
he
said
she
came
up
on
the
same
ship
with
you
that
is
true
why
did
you
tell
me
why
did
you
write
me
that
she
was
with
you
in
seattle
i
do
know
i
did
think
of
it
she
regarded
him
coolly
has
anybody
discovered
who
or
what
she
is
why
are
you
so
curious
about
her
mildred
shrugged
her
shoulders
your
discussion
with
willis
marsh
that
night
at
our
house
interested
me
very
much
i
thought
i
would
ask
marsh
to
bring
her
around
when
we
went
ashore
it
would
be
rather
amusing
she
would
come
out
to
the
yacht
and
return
my
call
would
she
boyd
smiled
at
her
frank
concern
at
this
possibility
you
do
know
the
kind
of
girl
she
is
he
said
she
is
at
all
what
you
think
i
do
believe
you
would
be
able
to
meet
her
in
the
way
you
suggest
indeed
mildred
arched
her
brows
why
she
would
fancy
being
around
particularly
by
marsh
from
her
look
of
surprise
he
knew
that
he
had
touched
on
dangerous
ground
and
he
made
haste
to
lead
the
conversation
back
to
its
former
channel
he
wished
to
impress
mildred
with
the
fact
that
if
he
had
not
quite
succeeded
he
had
by
no
means
failed
but
she
listened
indifferently
with
the
air
of
humoring
an
insistent
child
i
wish
you
would
give
it
up
and
try
something
else
she
said
at
last
this
is
no
place
for
you
why
you
are
losing
all
your
old
wit
and
buoyancy
you
are
actually
growing
serious
and
serious
people
are
not
at
all
amusing
just
then
alton
clyde
and
a
group
of
people
among
whom
was
willis
marsh
emerged
from
the
cabin
talking
and
laughing
mildred
arose
saying
here
come
the
berrys
ready
to
go
ashore
when
may
i
see
you
again
he
inquired
quickly
you
may
come
out
this
evening
his
eyes
blazed
as
he
answered
i
shall
come
as
the
others
came
up
she
said
emerson
ca
accompany
us
he
wishes
to
see
father
i
just
left
him
in
the
cabin
said
marsh
he
helped
the
ladies
to
the
ladder
and
a
moment
later
emerson
waved
the
party
adieu
then
turned
to
the
saloon
in
search
of
wayne
wayland
in
wayland
stiff
greeting
there
was
no
hint
that
the
two
men
had
ever
been
friendly
but
emerson
was
prepared
for
coolness
and
seated
himself
without
waiting
for
an
invitation
glad
of
the
chance
to
rest
his
tired
limbs
he
could
not
refrain
from
comparing
these
splendid
quarters
with
his
own
bare
living
shack
the
big
carved
desk
the
heavy
leather
chairs
the
amply
fitted
sideboard
seemed
magnificent
by
contrast
his
eyes
roved
over
the
walls
with
their
bookshelves
and
rare
paintings
and
between
velour
hangings
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
bedroom
all
in
cool
white
enamel
the
unaccustomed
feel
of
the
velvet
carpet
was
grateful
to
his
feet
he
coveted
that
soft
bed
in
yonder
with
its
smooth
linen
for
all
these
things
he
felt
the
savage
hunger
that
comes
of
deprivation
and
hardship
wayland
had
removed
his
glasses
and
was
waiting
grimly
i
have
a
good
deal
to
say
to
you
sir
emerson
began
and
i
would
like
you
to
hear
me
through
go
ahead
i
am
going
to
tell
you
some
things
about
marsh
that
i
dare
say
you
will
disbelieve
but
i
can
verify
my
statements
i
think
you
are
a
just
man
and
i
do
believe
you
know
or
would
approve
the
methods
he
has
used
against
me
if
this
is
to
be
an
arraignment
of
marsh
i
suggest
that
you
wait
until
he
can
be
present
he
has
gone
ashore
with
the
women
folks
i
prefer
to
talk
to
you
first
we
can
call
him
in
later
if
you
wish
before
we
begin
may
i
inquire
what
you
expect
of
me
i
expect
relief
you
remember
our
agreement
i
do
want
assistance
i
want
relief
whatever
the
distinction
in
the
words
i
understand
that
you
are
asking
a
favor
i
do
consider
it
so
very
well
proceed
when
you
sent
me
out
three
years
ago
to
make
a
fortune
for
mildred
it
was
understood
that
there
should
be
fair
play
on
both
sides
have
you
played
fair
quickly
interposed
the
old
man
i
have
when
i
came
to
chicago
i
had
no
idea
that
you
were
interested
in
the
pacific
coast
fisheries
i
had
raised
the
money
before
i
discovered
that
you
even
knew
willis
marsh
then
it
was
too
late
to
retreat
when
i
reached
seattle
all
sorts
of
unexpected
obstacles
came
up
i
lost
the
ship
i
had
chartered
machinery
houses
refused
deliveries
shipments
went
astray
my
bank
finally
refused
its
loan
and
every
other
bank
in
the
northwest
followed
suit
i
was
harassed
in
every
possible
way
and
it
was
chance
that
caused
it
it
was
willis
marsh
he
set
spies
upon
me
he
incited
a
dock
strike
that
resulted
in
a
riot
and
the
death
of
at
least
one
man
moreover
he
tried
to
have
me
killed
how
do
you
know
he
did
that
i
have
no
legal
proof
but
i
know
it
just
the
same
wayland
smiled
that
is
not
a
very
definite
charge
you
surely
do
hold
him
responsible
for
the
death
of
that
striker
i
do
and
for
the
action
of
the
police
in
trying
to
fix
the
crime
upon
me
you
know
perhaps
how
i
got
away
from
seattle
when
marsh
arrived
at
kalvik
he
first
tried
to
sink
my
boilers
failing
in
that
he
ruined
my
iron
chinks
then
he
my
not
because
he
needed
more
fish
but
purely
to
spoil
my
catch
the
day
the
run
started
he
bribed
my
fishermen
to
break
their
contracts
leaving
me
he
did
need
more
men
but
did
that
simply
to
cripple
me
i
got
indians
to
replace
the
white
men
but
he
won
them
away
by
a
miserable
trick
and
by
threats
that
i
have
no
doubt
he
would
make
good
if
the
poor
devils
dared
to
stand
out
his
men
wo
allow
my
fellows
to
work
we
have
had
our
nets
cut
and
our
fish
thrown
out
last
night
we
had
a
bad
time
on
the
banks
and
a
number
of
people
were
hurt
the
situation
is
growing
worse
every
hour
and
there
will
be
bloodshed
unless
this
persecution
stops
all
i
want
is
a
fair
chance
there
are
fish
enough
for
us
all
in
the
kalvik
but
that
man
has
used
the
power
of
your
organization
to
ruin
me
not
for
business
reasons
but
for
personal
spite
i
have
played
the
game
squarely
wayland
but
unless
this
ceases
i
through
you
are
through
yes
the
run
is
nearly
a
week
old
and
i
have
begun
to
pack
my
salmon
i
have
less
than
half
a
boat
crew
and
of
those
half
are
laid
up
the
president
of
the
trust
stirred
for
the
first
time
since
boyd
had
begun
his
recital
the
grim
lines
about
his
mouth
set
themselves
deeper
and
staring
with
cold
gray
eyes
at
the
speaker
he
said
well
sir
what
you
have
told
me
confirms
my
judgment
that
willis
marsh
is
the
right
man
in
the
right
place
completely
taken
back
by
this
unexpected
reply
boyd
exclaimed
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
approve
of
what
he
has
done
yes
of
what
i
know
he
has
done
marsh
is
pursuing
a
definite
policy
laid
down
by
his
board
of
directors
you
have
shown
me
that
he
has
done
his
work
well
you
knew
before
you
left
the
east
that
we
intended
to
crush
all
opposition
emerson
voice
was
sharp
as
he
cried
i
understand
all
that
but
am
i
to
understand
also
that
the
directors
of
the
instructed
him
to
kill
me
tut
tut
do
talk
nonsense
you
admit
that
you
have
no
proof
of
willis
connection
with
the
attempt
upon
your
life
you
put
yourself
in
the
way
of
danger
when
you
hired
scab
labor
to
break
that
strike
i
think
you
got
off
very
easily
if
marsh
was
instructed
to
crush
the
independents
why
has
he
centred
all
his
efforts
on
me
alone
why
has
he
spent
this
summer
in
kalvik
and
not
among
the
other
stations
to
the
south
that
is
our
business
different
methods
are
required
in
different
localities
then
you
have
no
criticism
to
make
you
uphold
him
indignation
was
getting
beyond
control
none
whatever
i
can
not
agree
that
marsh
is
even
indirectly
responsible
for
the
collision
of
the
scows
for
the
damage
to
your
machinery
or
for
the
fighting
between
the
men
on
the
contrary
i
know
that
he
is
doing
his
best
to
prevent
violence
because
it
interferes
with
the
catch
he
hired
your
men
because
he
needed
them
nobody
knows
who
broke
your
machinery
as
for
your
you
are
privileged
to
build
another
or
a
dozen
more
wherever
you
please
willis
has
already
told
me
everything
that
you
have
said
and
it
strikes
me
that
you
have
simply
been
outgeneraled
your
complaints
do
not
appeal
to
me
even
granting
your
absurd
assumption
that
marsh
tried
to
put
you
out
of
the
way
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
more
than
evened
the
score
how
he
is
still
wearing
bandages
over
that
you
gave
him
emerson
leaped
to
his
feet
he
knows
i
did
do
that
everybody
knows
it
he
cried
he
lied
to
you
we
wo
discuss
that
said
wayne
wayland
curtly
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
i
want
you
to
end
this
persecution
i
want
you
to
sail
him
off
in
other
words
you
want
me
to
save
you
emerson
swallowed
i
suppose
it
amounts
to
that
i
want
to
be
let
alone
i
want
a
square
deal
well
i
wo
wayne
wayland
voice
hardened
suddenly
his
sound
white
teeth
snapped
together
you
are
getting
exactly
what
you
deserve
you
betrayed
me
by
spying
upon
me
while
you
broke
bread
in
my
house
i
see
nothing
reprehensible
in
marsh
conduct
but
even
if
i
did
i
would
not
censure
him
any
measures
are
justifiable
against
a
traitor
boyd
emerson
face
went
gray
beneath
its
coating
of
tan
and
his
voice
threatened
to
break
as
he
said
i
am
no
traitor
and
you
know
it
i
thought
you
a
man
of
honor
and
i
came
to
you
not
for
help
but
for
justice
but
i
see
i
was
mistaken
i
am
beginning
to
believe
that
marsh
acted
under
your
instructions
from
the
first
believe
what
you
choose
you
think
you
got
me
but
you
have
i
beat
you
yet
you
ca
beat
me
at
anything
wayland
jaws
were
set
like
iron
not
this
year
perhaps
but
next
you
and
marsh
have
whipped
me
this
time
but
the
salmon
will
come
again
and
i
run
my
plant
in
spite
of
hell
wayne
wayland
made
as
if
to
speak
but
boyd
went
on
unheeding
taken
a
dislike
to
me
but
your
conduct
shows
that
you
fear
me
you
are
afraid
i
succeed
and
i
will
brave
talk
said
the
older
man
but
you
owe
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
your
stockholders
will
learn
of
your
mismanagement
your
persecution
you
mean
cried
the
other
i
can
explain
they
will
wait
another
year
i
will
raise
more
money
and
they
will
stand
by
me
perhaps
i
know
more
about
that
than
you
do
emerson
strode
toward
the
desk
menacingly
crying
in
a
quivering
voice
i
warn
you
to
keep
your
hands
off
of
them
by
god
do
try
any
of
your
financial
trickery
with
me
or
i
wayne
wayland
leaped
from
his
chair
his
face
purple
and
his
eyes
flashing
savagely
leave
this
yacht
he
thundered
i
wo
allow
you
to
insult
me
i
wo
stand
your
threats
i
got
you
where
i
want
you
and
when
the
time
comes
you
know
it
now
get
out
he
stretched
forth
a
great
square
hand
and
closed
it
so
fiercely
that
the
fingers
cracked
crush
you
like
that
boyd
turned
and
strode
from
the
cabin
with
anger
he
stumbled
down
the
ladder
to
his
launch
back
to
the
plant
he
ordered
then
gazed
with
lowering
brows
and
defiant
eyes
at
grande
as
she
rested
swanlike
and
serene
at
her
moorings
his
anger
against
mildred
father
destroyed
for
the
time
all
thought
of
his
disappointment
at
her
own
lack
of
understanding
and
her
cool
acceptance
of
his
failure
he
saw
only
that
his
affairs
had
reached
a
final
climax
where
he
must
bow
to
the
inevitable
or
big
george
parting
words
came
to
him
strike
one
last
blow
in
reprisal
a
kind
of
sickening
rage
possessed
him
he
had
tried
to
fight
fair
against
an
enemy
who
knew
no
scruple
partly
that
he
might
win
that
enemy
respect
now
he
was
thoroughly
beaten
and
humbled
after
all
he
was
merely
an
adventurer
without
friends
of
resources
his
long
struggle
had
made
him
the
type
of
man
of
whom
desperate
things
might
be
expected
he
might
as
well
act
the
part
why
should
he
pretend
to
higher
standards
than
wayne
wayland
or
marsh
george
way
was
best
by
the
time
he
had
reached
the
cannery
he
had
practically
made
up
his
mind
it
was
the
hour
of
his
darkest
despair
the
real
crisis
in
his
life
there
are
times
when
it
rests
with
fate
to
make
a
strong
man
stronger
or
turn
him
altogether
to
evil
such
a
man
will
not
accept
misfortune
tamely
he
is
the
reverse
of
those
who
are
good
through
weakness
it
is
his
nature
to
sin
strongly
but
the
unexpected
happened
and
boyd
black
mood
vanished
in
amazement
at
the
sight
which
met
his
eyes
moored
to
the
was
a
lighter
awash
with
a
cargo
that
made
him
stare
and
doubt
his
vision
he
had
seen
his
scanty
crew
of
return
with
the
rising
sun
exhausted
disheartened
depleted
in
numbers
yet
there
before
him
were
thousands
of
salmon
they
were
strewn
in
a
great
mass
upon
the
dock
and
inside
the
shed
while
from
the
scow
beneath
they
came
in
showers
as
the
handlers
tossed
them
upward
from
their
pues
through
the
wide
doors
he
saw
the
backs
of
the
butchers
busily
at
work
over
their
tables
and
heard
the
uproar
of
his
cannery
running
full
for
the
first
time
before
the
launch
had
touched
he
had
leaped
to
the
ladder
and
swung
himself
upon
the
dock
he
stumbled
into
the
arms
of
big
george
where
did
those
fish
come
from
he
cried
breathlessly
from
the
trap
george
smiled
as
he
had
not
smiled
in
many
weeks
they
struck
in
like
i
knew
they
would
and
they
running
now
by
the
thousands
i
fished
these
waters
for
years
but
i
never
seen
the
likes
of
it
they
tear
that
trap
to
pieces
they
smothering
in
the
pot
tons
and
tons
of
with
millions
more
milling
below
the
leads
because
they
ca
get
in
it
a
sight
you
not
see
once
in
a
lifetime
that
means
that
we
can
run
the
plant
that
we
get
all
we
can
use
hell
we
got
fish
enough
to
run
two
canneries
they
struck
their
gait
i
tell
you
and
they
never
stop
now
night
or
day
till
through
we
do
need
no
what
we
need
is
butchers
and
slimers
and
handlers
there
never
was
a
trap
site
in
the
north
till
this
one
i
told
willis
marsh
that
years
ago
he
flung
out
a
long
hairy
arm
bared
half
to
the
shoulder
and
waved
it
exultantly
we
built
this
plant
to
cook
forty
thousand
salmon
a
day
but
i
bring
you
three
thousand
every
hour
and
you
got
to
cook
do
you
hear
and
they
could
cork
us
after
all
emerson
leaned
unsteadily
against
a
pile
for
his
head
was
whirling
no
we
show
that
gang
what
a
cannery
can
do
marsh
traps
will
rot
where
they
stand
big
george
shook
his
fist
again
we
won
my
boy
we
won
then
do
let
us
stand
here
talking
cried
emerson
sharply
hurry
hurry
he
turned
and
sped
up
the
dock
he
had
come
into
his
own
at
last
and
he
vowed
with
teeth
that
no
wheel
should
stop
no
belt
should
slacken
no
man
should
leave
his
duty
till
the
run
had
passed
at
the
entrance
to
the
throbbing
clanging
building
he
paused
an
instant
and
with
a
smile
looked
toward
the
yacht
floating
lazily
in
the
distance
then
with
knees
sagging
beneath
him
from
weariness
he
entered
chapter
xxv
the
clash
i
heard
the
news
cried
cherry
later
that
afternoon
shrieking
to
make
herself
heard
above
the
rattle
and
jar
of
the
machinery
there
seems
to
be
a
providence
that
watches
over
fishermen
said
boyd
i
am
happy
for
your
sake
and
i
want
to
apologize
for
my
display
of
temper
come
away
where
i
wo
have
to
scream
so
i
want
to
talk
to
you
it
is
music
to
my
ears
he
answered
as
he
led
her
past
the
rows
of
chinamen
bowed
before
their
as
if
busied
with
some
heathen
rites
but
i
glad
to
sit
down
just
the
same
i
been
on
my
feet
for
hours
you
poor
boy
why
do
you
take
some
sleep
i
ca
george
is
coming
with
another
load
of
fish
and
the
plant
is
so
new
i
am
afraid
to
leave
it
even
for
an
hour
it
too
much
for
one
man
she
declared
oh
i
sleep
did
you
see
her
questioned
cherry
yes
she
must
be
very
proud
of
you
she
said
wistfully
i
i
do
think
she
understands
what
i
am
trying
to
do
or
what
it
means
our
talk
was
not
very
satisfactory
she
surely
must
have
understood
what
marsh
is
doing
i
did
tell
her
that
why
not
what
good
would
it
have
done
why
cherry
seemed
bewildered
she
could
put
a
stop
to
it
she
could
use
her
influence
with
her
father
against
marsh
i
expected
to
see
your
old
crew
back
at
work
again
oh
i
wish
i
had
her
power
she
would
take
a
hand
under
any
circumstances
it
would
occur
to
her
and
naturally
i
could
ask
her
boyd
flushed
uncomfortably
thanks
to
george
trap
there
is
no
need
he
went
on
to
tell
cherry
of
the
scene
with
wayland
and
its
stormy
ending
they
have
used
all
their
resources
to
down
you
she
said
but
luck
is
with
you
and
you
must
let
them
succeed
now
is
the
time
to
show
them
what
is
in
you
go
in
and
win
her
now
against
all
of
them
he
was
grateful
for
her
sympathy
yet
somehow
it
made
him
uncomfortable
what
was
it
you
wished
to
see
me
about
he
asked
oh
have
you
seen
chakawana
no
she
disappeared
early
this
morning
soon
after
the
yacht
came
in
i
ca
find
her
anywhere
she
took
the
baby
with
her
and
i
worried
does
constantine
know
where
she
is
why
constantine
is
down
here
is
he
he
has
been
here
since
yesterday
cherry
rose
nervously
there
is
something
wrong
boyd
they
have
been
acting
queerly
for
a
long
time
then
you
are
alone
at
your
place
he
said
thoughtfully
i
think
you
had
better
come
down
here
oh
no
i
shall
send
some
one
up
to
spend
the
night
at
your
house
you
should
be
left
unprotected
but
just
then
constantine
came
sauntering
round
the
corner
of
the
building
thank
heaven
cried
cherry
he
will
know
where
the
others
are
but
when
his
mistress
questioned
him
constantine
merely
replied
i
don
know
i
no
see
chakawana
they
have
been
gone
since
morning
and
i
ca
find
them
anywhere
umph
i
guess
they
all
right
there
is
something
queer
about
this
said
emerson
where
have
you
been
all
day
i
go
sleep
i
tired
from
fighting
last
night
i
come
back
now
and
go
work
chakawana
come
back
too
i
guess
well
i
do
need
you
so
you
better
go
back
to
house
and
stay
there
till
i
send
for
you
constantine
acquiesced
calmly
and
a
few
minutes
later
accompanied
his
mistress
up
the
beach
as
she
passed
marsh
cannery
cherry
saw
a
tender
moored
to
the
dock
and
noticed
strangers
among
the
buildings
they
stared
at
her
curiously
as
if
the
sight
of
a
white
girl
attended
by
a
giant
were
part
of
the
picturesqueness
they
expected
as
she
drew
near
her
own
house
she
saw
a
woman
approaching
and
while
yet
a
distant
she
recognized
her
a
jealous
tightening
of
her
throat
and
a
flutter
at
her
breast
told
her
that
this
was
mildred
wayland
cherry
would
have
passed
on
silently
but
miss
wayland
checked
her
pardon
me
she
said
will
you
tell
me
what
that
building
is
used
for
she
pointed
to
the
village
above
that
is
the
greek
church
how
interesting
are
there
many
greeks
here
no
it
is
a
relic
of
the
russian
days
the
natives
worship
there
i
intended
to
go
closer
but
the
walking
is
not
very
good
is
it
she
glanced
down
at
her
dainty
french
shoes
then
at
do
you
live
here
yes
in
the
log
house
yonder
indeed
i
tried
to
find
some
one
there
but
you
were
out
of
course
you
have
it
arranged
very
cozily
i
see
mildred
manner
was
faintly
patronizing
she
was
vexed
at
the
beauty
and
evident
refinement
of
this
woman
whom
she
had
thought
to
find
so
different
if
you
will
go
back
i
will
show
it
to
you
from
the
inside
miss
wayland
cherry
enjoyed
her
start
at
the
name
and
the
look
of
cold
hostility
that
followed
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
said
mildred
i
did
not
think
we
had
met
you
are
she
raised
her
brows
inquiringly
cherry
malotte
of
course
i
remember
marsh
spoke
of
you
i
am
sorry
i
beg
your
pardon
i
say
i
am
sorry
marsh
ever
spoke
of
me
mildred
smiled
frigidly
evidently
you
do
not
like
him
nobody
in
alaska
likes
him
do
you
you
see
i
am
not
an
alaskan
it
occurred
to
cherry
that
this
girl
was
ignorant
of
the
unexpected
change
in
boyd
affairs
she
decided
to
sound
her
to
find
out
for
herself
the
answer
to
those
questions
which
boyd
had
evaded
he
had
not
spoken
to
mildred
of
marsh
perhaps
if
she
knew
the
truth
she
would
love
him
better
and
even
now
her
assistance
would
not
be
valueless
do
you
know
that
marsh
is
to
blame
for
all
of
boyd
misfortune
she
said
boyd
yes
boyd
of
course
oh
let
us
not
pretend
i
call
him
by
his
first
name
i
think
you
ought
to
know
the
truth
about
this
business
even
if
boyd
is
too
chivalrous
to
tell
you
why
do
you
think
he
has
not
told
me
i
have
just
come
from
him
if
emerson
blames
any
one
but
himself
for
his
failure
i
am
sure
he
would
have
told
me
then
you
do
know
him
i
never
knew
him
to
ask
another
to
defend
him
he
never
asked
me
to
defend
him
i
merely
thought
that
if
you
knew
the
truth
you
might
help
him
i
how
it
is
for
you
to
find
a
way
he
has
met
with
opposition
and
treachery
at
every
step
i
think
it
is
time
some
one
came
to
his
aid
he
has
had
your
assistance
at
all
times
has
he
not
i
have
tried
to
help
wherever
i
could
but
i
have
your
power
mildred
shrugged
her
shoulders
you
even
went
to
seattle
to
help
him
did
you
not
i
went
there
on
my
own
business
why
do
you
take
such
an
interest
in
emerson
affairs
may
i
ask
it
was
i
who
induced
him
to
take
up
this
venture
said
cherry
proudly
i
found
him
discouraged
ready
to
give
up
i
helped
to
put
new
heart
into
him
i
have
something
at
stake
in
the
enterprise
too
but
that
nothing
i
hate
to
see
a
good
man
driven
to
the
wall
by
a
scoundrel
like
marsh
wait
there
is
something
to
be
said
on
both
sides
marsh
was
magnanimous
enough
to
overlook
that
attempt
upon
his
life
what
attempt
you
must
have
heard
he
was
wounded
in
the
shoulder
did
boyd
tell
you
the
truth
about
that
he
told
me
everything
said
mildred
coldly
this
woman
attitude
was
unbearable
it
would
seem
that
she
even
dared
to
criticise
her
mildred
wayland
for
her
treatment
of
boyd
she
pretended
to
a
truer
friendship
a
more
intimate
knowledge
of
him
but
no
it
pretense
it
was
too
natural
too
unconscious
for
that
and
therein
lay
the
sting
i
shall
ask
him
about
it
again
this
evening
she
continued
if
there
has
really
been
persecution
as
you
suggest
i
shall
tell
my
father
you
wo
see
boyd
this
evening
said
cherry
oh
yes
i
shall
he
is
very
busy
and
i
do
think
he
can
see
you
you
do
understand
i
told
him
to
come
out
to
the
yacht
temper
rose
at
the
light
she
saw
in
the
other
woman
face
but
if
he
should
disappoint
you
cherry
insisted
remember
that
the
fish
are
running
and
you
have
no
time
to
lose
if
you
are
going
to
help
mildred
tossed
her
head
to
be
frank
with
you
i
never
liked
this
enterprise
of
boyd
now
that
i
have
seen
the
place
and
the
people
well
i
ca
say
that
i
like
it
better
the
country
is
a
bit
different
but
the
people
are
much
the
same
in
kalvik
and
in
chicago
you
will
find
unscrupulous
men
and
unselfish
women
everywhere
mildred
gave
her
a
cool
glance
that
took
her
in
from
head
to
foot
and
vice
versa
i
dare
say
you
speak
from
a
wider
experience
than
i
with
a
careless
nod
she
picked
her
way
toward
the
launch
where
her
friends
were
already
assembling
she
was
angry
and
suspicious
her
pride
was
hurt
because
she
had
not
been
able
to
feel
superior
to
the
other
woman
instead
she
had
descended
to
the
weak
resource
of
innuendo
while
cherry
had
been
simple
and
direct
she
had
expected
to
recognize
instantly
the
type
of
person
with
whom
she
had
to
deal
but
she
found
herself
baffled
who
was
this
woman
what
was
she
doing
here
why
had
boyd
never
told
her
of
this
extraordinary
intimacy
she
remembered
more
than
one
occasion
when
he
had
defended
the
woman
she
resolved
to
put
an
end
to
the
affair
at
once
boyd
must
either
give
up
cherry
or
during
the
talk
between
the
two
young
women
constantine
had
kept
at
a
respectful
distance
but
when
mildred
had
gone
he
came
up
to
cherry
with
the
question
who
is
that
that
is
miss
wayland
that
is
the
richest
girl
in
the
world
constantine
humph
and
the
pity
of
it
is
she
does
understand
how
very
rich
she
is
her
father
owns
all
these
canneries
and
many
more
besides
and
lots
of
railroads
but
you
do
know
what
a
railroad
is
do
you
mebbe
him
rich
as
marsh
eh
a
thousand
time
richer
marsh
works
for
him
the
way
you
work
for
me
being
too
much
a
gentleman
to
dispute
his
mistress
word
constantine
merely
shook
his
head
and
smiled
broadly
she
fine
lady
he
acknowledged
she
got
plenty
nice
dress
silik
yes
silk
she
more
than
you
be
he
added
with
reluctant
candor
mebbe
that
lie
marsh
eh
white
men
all
work
for
marsh
he
no
work
for
nobody
no
it
is
true
marsh
knows
how
rich
she
is
and
that
is
why
he
wants
to
marry
her
the
breed
wheeled
swiftly
his
soft
soles
crunching
the
gravel
marsh
want
her
he
repeated
as
if
doubting
his
ears
yes
that
is
why
he
has
fought
emerson
they
both
want
to
marry
her
that
is
why
marsh
broke
emerson
machinery
and
hired
his
men
away
from
him
and
cut
his
nets
they
hate
each
other
do
you
understand
me
savvy
said
constantine
shortly
then
strode
on
beside
the
girl
me
think
all
the
time
emerson
goin
marry
you
cherry
gasped
no
no
why
he
is
in
love
with
miss
wayland
he
don
marry
her
than
marsh
will
get
her
i
dare
say
after
a
moment
constantine
announced
with
conviction
i
guess
marsh
is
damn
bad
man
i
glad
you
have
discovered
that
he
has
even
tried
to
kill
emerson
that
shows
the
sort
of
man
he
is
it
good
thing
get
marry
said
constantine
vaguely
the
father
say
if
woman
don
marry
she
go
to
hell
i
hate
to
think
that
laughed
the
girl
that
true
the
other
affirmed
stoutly
the
pries
he
say
so
and
pries
don
lie
he
say
man
takes
a
woman
and
don
get
marry
they
both
go
to
hell
and
burn
forever
little
baby
come
and
he
go
to
hell
too
oh
i
understand
the
father
wants
to
make
sure
of
his
people
and
he
is
quite
right
you
natives
have
observed
the
law
very
carefully
he
say
indian
woman
stop
with
white
man
she
never
see
jesus
house
no
more
she
go
to
hell
sure
and
baby
go
too
you
that
true
i
dare
say
it
is
in
a
way
by
god
that
tough
on
little
baby
exclaimed
constantine
fervently
all
that
night
boyd
stayed
at
his
post
while
the
cavernous
building
shuddered
and
hissed
to
the
straining
toil
of
the
machines
and
the
gasping
breath
of
the
furnaces
as
the
darkness
gathered
he
had
gone
out
upon
the
dock
to
look
regretfully
toward
the
twinkling
lights
on
grande
then
turned
doggedly
back
to
his
labors
another
load
had
just
arrived
from
the
trap
already
the
plant
untried
by
the
stress
of
a
steady
run
was
clogged
and
working
far
below
capacity
he
would
have
sent
mildred
word
but
he
had
not
a
single
man
to
spare
at
ten
the
next
morning
he
staggered
into
his
quarters
more
dead
than
alive
in
his
heart
was
a
great
thankfulness
that
big
george
had
not
found
him
wanting
the
last
defective
machine
was
mended
the
last
weakness
strengthened
and
the
plant
had
reached
its
fullest
stride
the
fish
might
come
now
in
any
quantity
the
rest
was
but
a
matter
of
coal
and
iron
and
human
endurance
meanwhile
he
would
sleep
he
met
fingerless
fraser
emerging
decked
royally
in
all
the
splendor
of
new
clothes
and
spotless
linen
where
are
you
going
boyd
asked
him
i
going
out
into
society
clyde
is
taking
you
to
the
yacht
eh
no
he
afraid
of
my
work
so
i
going
out
on
my
own
he
told
me
all
about
the
swell
quilts
at
marsh
place
so
i
thought
i
lam
up
there
and
look
them
over
i
may
cop
an
heiress
he
winked
wisely
if
i
see
one
that
looks
gentle
i
liable
to
grab
me
some
bride
he
says
there
ai
one
that
got
less
than
a
couple
of
millions
in
her
kick
boyd
was
too
weary
to
do
more
than
wish
him
success
but
it
seemed
that
fortune
favored
fraser
for
before
he
had
gone
far
he
saw
a
young
woman
seated
in
a
patch
of
wild
flowers
plucking
the
blooms
with
careless
hand
while
she
drank
in
the
beauty
of
the
bright
arctic
morning
she
was
simply
dressed
yet
looked
so
prosperous
that
fraser
instantly
decided
that
her
i
spread
my
checks
with
this
one
he
began
the
girl
gave
him
an
indifferent
glance
from
two
fearless
eyes
and
nodded
slightly
but
fingerless
fraser
upon
occasion
could
summon
a
smile
that
was
peculiarly
engaging
he
did
so
now
seating
himself
hat
in
hand
with
the
words
if
you
do
mind
i
rest
a
minute
i
out
for
my
morning
walk
it
a
nice
day
is
it
as
she
did
not
answer
he
ran
on
glibly
my
name
is
de
benville
i
one
of
the
new
orleans
branch
that
my
cannery
down
yonder
he
pointed
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
just
come
indeed
said
the
young
lady
yes
it
mine
a
wrinkle
gathered
at
the
corners
of
the
stranger
eyes
her
face
showed
a
flicker
of
amusement
i
thought
that
was
emerson
cannery
she
said
oh
the
idea
he
only
runs
it
for
me
i
put
up
the
money
you
know
him
eh
the
girl
nodded
yes
i
know
clyde
also
who
alton
he
queried
with
reassuring
warmth
why
you
and
i
have
got
mutual
friends
alton
and
me
is
pals
he
shook
his
head
solemnly
ai
he
a
scourge
i
beg
your
pardon
i
say
ai
he
an
awful
thing
he
ai
anything
like
emerson
there
a
swallow
all
right
all
right
i
like
him
are
you
very
intimate
with
him
am
i
i
closer
to
him
than
a
porous
plaster
when
boyd
ai
around
i
him
that
all
from
her
look
fraser
judged
that
he
was
progressing
finely
he
hastened
to
add
i
always
like
to
help
out
young
fellows
like
him
i
like
to
give
a
chance
that
my
name
you
know
chancy
de
benville
always
game
to
take
a
chance
is
that
your
yacht
no
my
father
and
i
are
merely
passengers
so
you
trailed
the
old
skeezicks
along
with
you
well
that
right
make
the
most
of
your
father
while
you
got
him
if
i
paid
more
attention
to
mine
i
have
been
better
off
now
but
i
was
wild
fraser
winked
in
a
manner
to
inform
his
listener
that
all
worldly
wisdom
was
his
i
wanted
to
be
a
jockey
and
the
old
party
cut
me
off
what
got
now
i
made
all
by
myself
but
if
i
stayed
in
bloomington
i
might
have
been
president
of
the
bank
by
this
time
bloomington
i
understood
you
to
say
new
orleans
my
old
man
had
a
whole
string
of
banks
fraser
averred
hastily
tell
me
is
emerson
ill
asked
the
girl
ill
enough
to
lick
a
den
of
wildcats
he
intended
coming
out
to
the
yacht
last
night
but
he
disappointed
us
he
as
busy
as
an
i
met
him
turning
in
just
as
i
came
out
for
my
constitutional
where
had
he
been
all
night
her
voice
betrayed
an
interest
that
fraser
was
quick
to
detect
he
answered
cannily
you
can
search
me
i
do
keep
cases
on
him
as
long
as
he
does
his
work
i
do
care
where
he
goes
at
quitting
time
he
resolved
that
this
girl
should
learn
nothing
from
him
there
seem
to
be
very
few
white
women
in
this
place
she
said
after
a
pause
only
one
till
you
people
came
maybe
you
crossed
her
trail
hardly
oh
she
all
right
take
it
on
the
word
of
a
she
an
ace
emerson
told
me
about
her
he
seems
quite
fond
of
her
i
always
said
they
make
a
pair
one
can
hardly
blame
her
for
trying
to
catch
him
oh
you
can
make
book
that
she
did
start
no
she
the
kind
to
curl
up
in
a
man
ear
and
whisper
she
do
have
to
all
she
needs
to
do
is
look
natural
the
men
will
fall
like
ripe
persimmons
they
have
been
together
a
great
deal
i
suppose
every
hour
of
the
day
and
the
days
are
long
said
fraser
cheerfully
but
he
ai
crippled
he
could
have
walked
away
if
wanted
to
it
a
good
thing
he
did
though
because
she
done
more
to
win
this
bet
for
us
than
we
done
ourselves
she
unusually
pretty
the
girl
remarked
coldly
yes
and
she
just
as
bright
as
she
is
but
i
do
care
for
blondes
fraser
gazed
admiringly
at
the
brown
hair
before
him
and
rolled
his
eyes
eloquently
i
strong
for
brunettes
i
am
it
the
creole
blood
in
me
she
gathered
up
her
wild
flowers
and
rose
saying
i
must
be
going
i
go
with
you
he
jumped
to
his
feet
with
alacrity
thank
you
i
prefer
to
walk
alone
could
think
of
it
i
but
he
paused
at
the
lift
of
her
brows
and
the
extraordinarily
frigid
look
she
gave
him
he
stood
in
his
tracks
watching
her
descend
the
river
trail
declined
with
thanks
he
murmured
i
need
and
mittens
to
handle
her
i
think
i
build
me
some
bonfire
and
thaw
out
she
must
own
the
mint
at
the
upper
cannery
mildred
found
alton
clyde
with
the
younger
berry
girl
she
called
him
aside
and
talked
earnestly
with
him
for
several
minutes
all
right
he
said
at
length
i
glad
to
get
out
of
course
the
rest
is
up
to
you
mildred
lips
were
white
and
her
voice
hard
as
she
cried
i
am
thoroughly
sick
of
it
all
i
have
played
the
fool
long
enough
now
look
here
clyde
objected
weakly
you
may
be
mistaken
and
it
does
look
like
quite
the
square
thing
to
do
but
she
silenced
him
with
an
angry
gesture
leave
that
to
me
i
through
with
him
all
right
let
hunt
up
the
governor
together
they
went
to
the
office
in
search
of
wayne
wayland
a
later
when
clyde
rejoined
miss
berry
she
noticed
that
he
seemed
ill
at
ease
gazing
down
the
bay
with
a
worried
speculative
look
in
his
colorless
eyes
boyd
emerson
roused
from
his
slumber
late
in
the
afternoon
still
worn
from
his
long
strain
and
aching
in
every
muscle
he
was
in
wretched
plight
physically
but
his
heart
was
aglow
with
gladness
big
george
was
still
at
the
trap
and
the
unceasing
rumble
from
across
the
way
told
him
that
the
fish
were
still
coming
in
as
he
was
finishing
his
breakfast
a
watchman
appeared
in
the
doorway
there
a
launch
at
the
dock
with
some
people
from
above
he
announced
i
stopped
them
according
to
orders
but
they
want
to
see
you
show
them
to
the
office
boyd
rose
and
went
into
the
other
building
where
a
moment
later
he
was
confronted
by
wayne
wayland
and
willis
marsh
the
old
man
nodded
to
him
shortly
marsh
began
we
heard
about
your
wayland
has
come
to
look
over
your
plant
it
is
not
for
sale
how
many
fish
are
you
getting
that
is
my
business
he
turned
to
wayland
i
hardly
expected
to
see
you
here
have
you
insulted
me
enough
just
a
moment
before
you
order
me
out
i
a
stockholder
in
this
company
and
i
am
within
my
rights
you
a
stockholder
how
much
stock
do
you
own
where
did
you
get
it
i
own
thousand
shares
outright
wayland
tossed
a
packet
of
certificates
upon
the
table
and
i
have
options
on
all
the
stock
you
placed
in
chicago
i
said
you
would
hear
from
me
when
the
time
came
so
you
think
the
time
has
come
to
crush
me
eh
said
emerson
well
you
been
swindled
only
of
the
capital
stock
has
been
sold
and
alton
clyde
holds
thousand
shares
of
that
the
old
man
smiled
grimly
i
have
not
been
swindled
then
clyde
sold
out
exploded
boyd
yes
i
paid
him
back
the
ten
thousand
dollars
he
put
in
and
i
took
over
the
thousand
shares
you
got
mildred
to
take
mildred
emerson
started
as
if
he
had
been
struck
are
you
insane
mildred
does
own
why
alton
never
told
me
who
put
up
that
money
do
tell
me
you
did
know
cried
wayne
wayland
you
knew
all
the
time
you
worked
your
friends
out
and
then
sent
that
to
my
daughter
when
you
saw
you
were
about
to
fail
you
managed
well
you
knew
she
could
refuse
how
did
you
find
out
that
she
held
the
stock
she
told
me
of
course
do
ask
me
to
believe
that
if
she
had
told
you
before
she
would
tell
you
now
all
i
can
say
is
that
she
acted
of
her
own
free
will
i
never
dreamed
she
put
up
that
thousand
dollars
what
do
you
intend
to
do
now
that
you
have
taken
over
these
holdings
what
do
you
think
i
would
spend
ten
times
the
money
to
save
my
daughter
the
old
man
was
quivering
you
are
only
a
minority
stockholder
the
control
of
this
enterprise
still
rests
with
me
and
my
friends
your
friends
cried
wayland
that
what
brings
me
here
you
and
your
friends
i
break
you
and
your
friends
if
it
takes
my
fortune
i
can
understand
your
dislike
of
me
but
my
associates
have
never
harmed
you
your
associates
and
who
are
they
a
lawless
ruffian
who
openly
threatened
willis
marsh
murder
and
a
loose
woman
from
the
take
care
cried
emerson
in
a
sharp
voice
the
old
man
waved
his
hands
as
if
at
a
loss
for
words
look
here
you
ca
be
an
utter
idiot
you
must
know
who
she
is
do
you
then
tell
me
wayne
wayland
turned
his
back
in
disgust
do
you
really
wish
to
know
marsh
smooth
voice
questioned
i
do
she
is
a
very
common
sort
said
willis
marsh
i
am
surprised
that
you
never
heard
of
her
while
you
were
in
the
country
she
followed
the
mining
camps
and
lived
as
such
women
do
she
is
an
expert
with
cards
she
even
dealt
faro
in
some
of
the
camps
how
do
you
know
i
looked
up
her
history
in
seattle
she
is
very
well
notorious
people
talk
like
that
about
nearly
every
woman
in
alaska
i
did
come
here
to
argue
about
that
woman
character
broke
in
wayland
you
have
said
enough
now
so
that
you
will
either
prove
your
words
or
apologize
if
you
want
proof
take
your
own
relation
with
her
it
notorious
even
mildred
has
heard
of
it
i
can
explain
to
her
in
a
word
perhaps
you
can
also
explain
that
affair
with
hilliard
if
so
you
had
better
do
it
i
suppose
you
did
know
anything
about
that
either
i
suppose
you
do
know
why
he
advanced
that
loan
after
once
refusing
it
they
have
a
name
for
men
like
you
who
take
money
from
women
of
her
sort
emerson
uttered
a
terrible
cry
and
his
face
blanched
to
a
gray
pallor
do
you
mean
to
say
i
sent
her
to
hilliard
hilliard
as
good
as
told
me
so
himself
do
you
wonder
that
i
am
willing
to
spend
a
fortune
to
protect
my
girl
from
a
man
like
you
going
to
break
you
i
got
a
foothold
in
this
enterprise
of
yours
and
i
root
you
out
if
it
takes
a
million
i
kick
you
back
into
the
gutter
where
you
belong
boyd
stood
appalled
at
the
violence
of
this
outburst
the
man
seemed
insane
he
could
not
find
words
to
answer
him
you
did
not
come
down
here
to
tell
me
that
he
said
at
last
no
i
came
here
with
a
message
from
mildred
she
has
told
me
to
dismiss
you
once
and
for
all
i
shall
take
my
dismissal
from
no
one
but
her
i
can
explain
everything
i
expected
you
to
say
that
if
you
want
her
own
words
read
this
with
shaking
fingers
he
thrust
a
letter
before
emerson
eyes
read
it
the
young
man
opened
the
envelope
and
read
in
a
he
knew
only
too
well
dear
boyd
the
conviction
has
been
growing
on
me
for
some
time
that
you
and
i
have
made
a
serious
mistake
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
into
details
let
us
spare
each
other
that
unpleasantness
i
am
familiar
with
all
that
father
will
say
to
you
and
his
feelings
are
mine
hence
there
is
no
necessity
for
further
explanations
believe
me
this
is
much
the
simplest
way
mildred
boyd
crushed
the
note
in
his
palm
and
tossed
it
away
carelessly
you
dictate
well
he
said
quietly
but
i
shall
tell
her
the
truth
and
she
will
oh
no
you
wo
you
wo
see
her
again
i
have
seen
to
that
mildred
is
engaged
to
willis
marsh
it
all
settled
i
warn
you
to
keep
away
her
engagement
has
been
announced
to
all
our
friends
on
the
yacht
i
tell
you
i
wo
take
my
dismissal
from
any
one
but
her
i
shall
come
aboard
grande
marsh
and
i
may
have
something
to
say
to
that
boyd
wheeled
upon
marsh
with
a
look
that
made
him
recoil
if
you
try
to
cross
me
i
strip
your
back
and
lash
you
till
you
howl
like
a
dog
marsh
florid
face
went
pale
his
tongue
became
suddenly
too
dry
for
speech
but
wayne
wayland
was
not
to
be
cowed
i
warn
you
again
to
keep
away
from
my
daughter
he
cried
furiously
and
i
warn
you
that
i
shall
come
aboard
the
yacht
alone
the
president
of
the

turned
and
followed
by
his
lieutenant

chapter
xxvi
in
which
a
score
is
settled
cherry
malotte
coming
down
to
the
cannery
on
her
daily
visit
saw
willis
marsh
and
wayland
leaving
it
wondering
she
hurried
into
the
main
building
in
search
of
boyd
the
place
was
as
busy
as
when
she
had
left
it
on
the
afternoon
before
and
she
saw
that
the
men
had
been
at
work
all
night
many
of
them
were
sprawled
in
corners
where
they
had
sunk
from
weariness
snatching
a
moment
rest
before
the
boss
kicked
them
back
to
their
posts
the
chinese
hands
were
stoically
performing
their
tasks
their
yellow
faces
haggard
with
the
strain
at
the
yesterday
crew
was
still
slitting
slashing
hacking
at
the
pile
of
fish
that
never
seemed
to
grow
less
some
of
them
were
giving
up
staggering
away
to
their
bunks
while
others
with
more
vitality
had
stood
so
long
in
the
slime
and
salt
drip
that
their
feet
had
swelled
and
it
had
become
necessary
to
cut
off
their
shoes
boyd
was
standing
in
the
door
of
the
office
in
a
few
words
he
told
her
of
wayland
threat
do
you
think
he
can
injure
the
company
she
inquired
anxiously
i
have
a
doubt
of
it
he
can
work
very
serious
harm
at
least
tell
me
why
did
he
turn
against
you
so
suddenly
what
made
miss
wayland
angry
with
you
i
i
would
rather
not
why
i
your
partner
and
i
ought
to
be
told
you
and
george
and
i
will
have
to
work
together
closer
than
ever
now
do
let
begin
by
concealing
anything
well
perhaps
you
had
better
know
the
whole
thing
said
boyd
slowly
mildred
does
not
like
you
her
father
mind
has
been
poisoned
by
marsh
it
seems
they
resent
our
friendship
they
believe
all
sorts
of
things
so
i
am
the
cause
of
your
trouble
after
all
they
blame
me
equally
more
than
you
it
seems
that
marsh
made
an
inquiry
into
your
well
your
life
history
and
he
babbled
all
the
gossip
he
heard
to
them
of
course
they
believed
it
not
knowing
you
as
i
do
and
they
misunderstood
our
friendship
but
i
can
explain
and
i
shall
to
mildred
then
i
shall
prove
marsh
a
liar
perhaps
i
can
show
wayland
that
he
was
in
the
wrong
it
our
only
hope
what
did
marsh
say
about
me
asked
the
girl
she
was
pale
to
the
lips
he
said
a
lot
of
things
that
at
any
other
time
i
would
have
made
him
swallow
on
the
spot
but
it
only
a
pleasure
deferred
with
your
help
i
do
it
in
their
presence
i
do
like
to
tell
you
this
but
the
truth
is
vital
to
us
all
and
i
want
to
arm
myself
cherry
was
silent
you
may
leave
it
to
me
he
said
gently
i
will
see
that
marsh
sets
you
right
there
is
nothing
to
set
right
said
the
girl
wearily
marsh
told
the
truth
i
dare
say
the
truth
my
god
you
do
know
what
you
saying
yes
i
do
she
returned
his
look
of
shocked
horror
with
defiance
you
must
have
known
who
i
am
fraser
knew
and
he
must
have
told
you
you
knew
i
had
followed
the
mining
camps
you
knew
i
had
lived
by
my
wits
you
must
have
known
what
people
thought
of
me
i
cast
my
lot
in
with
the
people
of
this
country
and
i
had
to
match
my
wits
with
those
of
every
man
i
met
sometimes
i
won
sometimes
i
did
not
you
know
the
north
i
did
know
he
said
slowly
i
never
thought
i
would
allow
myself
to
think
why
not
it
is
nothing
to
you
you
have
lived
and
so
have
i
made
mistakes
what
girl
does
who
has
to
fight
her
way
alone
but
my
past
is
my
own
it
concerns
nobody
but
me
she
saw
the
change
in
his
face
and
her
reckless
spirit
rose
oh
i
shocked
you
you
think
all
women
should
be
like
miss
wayland
have
you
ever
stopped
to
think
that
even
you
are
not
the
same
man
you
were
when
you
came
fresh
from
college
you
know
the
world
now
you
have
tasted
its
wickedness
would
you
change
your
knowledge
for
your
earlier
innocence
you
know
you
would
not
and
you
have
no
right
to
judge
me
by
a
separate
code
what
difference
does
it
make
who
i
am
or
what
i
have
done
i
did
ask
your
record
when
i
gave
you
the
chance
to
win
miss
wayland
and
neither
you
nor
she
have
any
right
to
challenge
mine
i
agree
with
you
in
that
i
came
away
from
the
mining
camps
because
of
wagging
tongues
because
i
was
forever
misjudged
whatever
i
may
have
been
i
have
at
least
played
fair
with
that
girl
it
hurts
me
now
to
be
accused
by
her
i
saw
your
love
for
her
and
i
never
tried
to
rob
her
oh
do
look
as
if
i
could
have
done
differently
if
i
had
tried
i
could
have
injured
her
very
easily
if
i
had
been
the
sort
she
thinks
me
but
i
helped
you
in
every
way
i
could
i
made
sacrifices
i
did
things
she
would
never
have
done
she
stopped
on
the
verge
of
tears
boyd
felt
the
justice
of
her
words
he
could
not
forget
the
unselfish
devotion
and
loyalty
she
had
shown
throughout
his
long
struggle
for
the
hundredth
time
there
came
to
him
the
memory
of
her
services
in
the
matter
of
hilliard
loan
and
the
thought
caused
him
unspeakable
distress
why
did
you
do
all
this
he
asked
do
you
know
cherry
gazed
at
him
with
a
faint
smile
then
for
the
first
time
the
whole
truth
burst
upon
him
the
surprise
of
it
almost
deprived
him
of
speech
and
he
stammered
no
i
i
then
he
fell
silent
what
little
i
did
i
did
because
i
love
you
said
the
girl
in
a
tired
voice
you
may
as
well
know
for
it
makes
no
difference
now
i
i
am
sorry
he
said
gripped
by
a
strong
emotion
that
made
him
go
hot
and
cold
i
have
been
a
fool
no
you
were
merely
wrapped
up
in
your
own
affairs
you
see
i
had
been
living
my
own
life
and
was
fairly
contented
till
you
came
then
everything
changed
for
a
long
time
i
hoped
you
might
grow
to
love
me
as
i
loved
you
but
i
found
it
was
no
use
when
i
saw
you
so
honest
and
unselfish
in
your
devotion
to
that
other
girl
i
thought
it
was
my
chance
to
do
something
unselfish
in
my
turn
it
was
hard
but
i
did
my
best
i
think
i
must
love
you
in
the
same
way
you
love
her
boyd
for
there
is
nothing
in
all
the
world
i
would
not
do
to
make
you
happy
that
all
there
is
to
the
poor
little
story
and
it
wo
make
any
difference
now
except
that
you
and
i
ca
go
on
as
we
have
done
i
shall
never
have
the
courage
to
come
back
after
this
you
will
win
miss
wayland
yet
and
attain
your
heart
desire
i
am
only
sorry
that
i
have
made
it
harder
for
you
that
i
can
not
help
you
any
further
but
i
can
not
there
is
but
one
thing
more
i
can
do
i
want
no
more
sacrifice
he
cried
roughly
i
been
blind
taken
too
much
from
you
already
the
girl
stood
for
a
moment
with
her
eyes
turned
toward
the
river
then
she
said
i
must
think
i
i
want
to
go
away
he
returned
and
stood
watching
her
as
she
hurried
away
half
suspecting
the
tears
that
were
trembling
amid
her
lashes
it
was
not
until
that
boyd
saw
fingerless
fraser
and
questioned
him
about
his
quest
for
an
heiress
nothing
doing
in
the
heiress
business
replied
the
adventurer
i
could
stand
the
exposure
they
were
cold
eh
yep
they
weathered
me
out
did
you
really
meet
any
of
those
people
sure
i
met
all
but
i
did
catch
their
names
i
one
before
i
gone
a
mile
tall
slim
party
with
cracked
ice
in
her
voice
boyd
looked
up
quickly
did
you
introduce
yourself
as
chancy
de
benville
that
all
how
is
that
for
a
monaker
she
fell
for
the
name
all
right
but
there
must
have
been
something
phony
about
the
clothes
that
the
trouble
with
this
park
harness
if
i
wore
my
and
fish
and
my
hat
i
have
passed
for
a
gentleman
sure
i
strong
for
those
evening
togs
i
see
another
one
later
a
little
maduro
colored
skirt
with
a
fat
nose
miss
berry
i
glad
to
meet
her
i
officed
her
out
of
a
rowboat
and
told
her
i
was
yonkers
of
new
york
we
was
breezing
along
on
the
bit
till
clyde
broke
it
up
he
called
me
fraser
and
it
was
cold
in
a
minute
fraser
is
a
cheap
name
anyhow
i
sorry
i
took
it
do
you
mean
to
say
it
is
your
real
name
asked
his
companion
in
genuine
bewilderment
naw
switzer
is
what
i
was
born
with
say
it
slow
and
it
sounds
like
an
air
brake
do
it
i
never
won
a
bet
as
long
as
i
packed
it
around
and
fraser
has
got
it
beat
by
more
than
a
lip
well
boyd
breathed
deeply
you
are
the
limit
speaking
of
clothes
i
notice
you
are
dressed
up
like
a
fruit
salad
what
is
it
the
yacht
yes
you
better
hurry
she
sails
at
high
tide
sails
alton
told
me
so
and
said
that
he
was
going
along
thank
heaven
for
that
anyhow
but
i
do
understand
about
the
other
boyd
voiced
the
question
that
was
foremost
in
his
mind
did
you
know
cherry
in
the
country
nope
she
said
you
did
she
said
that
yes
she
thought
you
had
told
me
who
she
was
hell
she
might
have
known
i
never
crack
it
her
own
business
and
i
got
troubles
enough
with
this
cannery
on
my
hands
i
wish
you
had
told
me
said
emerson
why
there
no
use
of
rehearsing
the
dope
nobody
can
live
the
past
over
again
and
who
wants
to
repeat
the
present
it
only
the
future
that
worth
while
i
guess
her
future
is
just
as
good
as
anybody
what
she
told
me
came
as
a
shock
fingerless
fraser
grunted
i
do
know
why
for
my
part
i
stand
for
an
ingenue
if
ever
i
get
married
cherry
the
sort
for
me
i
out
of
the
kindergarten
myself
and
i
hate
to
spend
my
life
cutting
paper
figures
for
my
wife
no
sir
if
i
ever
seize
a
frill
i
want
her
to
know
as
much
as
me
then
she
wo
tear
away
with
the
first
diamond
broker
that
stops
in
front
of
my
place
to
crank
up
his
you
never
heard
of
a
wise
woman
breaking
up
her
own
home
did
you
it
the
dolls
from
the
seminary
that
fall
for
bertie
the
beautiful
cloak
model
fraser
whittled
himself
a
toothpick
as
he
went
on
a
feller
in
my
line
of
business
do
gather
much
useful
information
but
he
certainly
gets
jerry
to
the
female
question
in
all
its
dips
angles
and
spurs
cherry
malotte
is
the
squarest
girl
i
ever
saw
and
while
she
may
have
been
crowded
at
the
turn
she
finish
true
it
takes
a
thoroughbred
to
do
that
and
the
guy
that
gets
her
will
win
his
derby
now
those
fillies
on
the
yacht
for
instance
warm
up
fine
but
you
ca
tell
how
they
run
we
not
talking
of
marriage
said
boyd
as
he
rose
when
he
had
gone
out
fraser
ruminated
aloud
maybe
not
i
ai
very
bright
and
we
may
have
been
talking
about
the
weather
however
if
you
after
that
dame
with
the
talk
instead
of
cherry
malotte
why
i
hope
you
get
her
there
no
accounting
for
tastes
i
certainly
did
my
best
to
send
you
along
this
morning
turning
to
the
jap
steward
he
remarked
sagely
my
boy
always
remember
one
thing
if
you
ca
boost
do
knock
wayne
wayland
was
by
no
means
sure
that
boyd
would
not
make
good
his
threat
to
visit
the
yacht
that
evening
and
in
any
case
he
wished
to
be
prepared
a
scene
before
the
other
passengers
of
grande
was
not
to
be
thought
of
besides
if
the
young
man
were
roughly
handled
it
would
make
him
a
martyr
in
mildred
eyes
he
talked
over
the
matter
with
marsh
who
suggested
that
the
sightseers
should
dine
ashore
and
spend
the
evening
with
him
at
the
plant
with
only
mildred
and
her
father
left
on
the
yacht
there
would
be
no
possibility
of
scandal
even
if
emerson
were
mad
enough
to
force
an
interview
and
what
is
more
declared
wayland
i
shall
give
orders
to
clear
on
the
high
tide
that
fellow
is
a
menace
and
the
sooner
mildred
is
away
from
him
the
better
you
shall
go
with
us
my
boy
but
when
he
went
to
mildred
to
explain
the
nature
of
his
arrangements
he
found
her
in
a
furious
temper
why
did
you
announce
my
engagement
to
mr
marsh
she
demanded
angrily
the
whole
ship
is
talking
about
it
by
what
right
did
you
do
that
i
did
it
for
your
own
sake
said
the
old
man
this
whelp
emerson
has
made
a
fool
of
you
and
of
me
long
enough
there
must
be
an
end
to
it
but
i
do
love
willis
marsh
she
cried
you
forget
i
am
of
age
nonsense
willis
is
a
fine
fellow
he
loves
you
and
he
is
the
best
business
man
for
his
years
i
have
ever
known
if
it
were
not
for
this
foolish
affair
you
would
return
his
love
he
suits
me
and
well
i
have
put
my
foot
down
so
there
an
end
of
it
do
you
intend
to
force
me
to
marry
him
wayland
recognized
the
absurd
take
all
the
time
you
wish
you
come
around
all
right
that
reprobate
you
were
engaged
to
defied
me
and
defended
that
woman
he
told
of
his
stormy
interview
with
boyd
concluding
it
is
fortunate
we
found
him
out
mildred
i
have
guarded
you
all
my
life
i
have
lavished
everything
money
could
buy
upon
you
i
have
built
up
the
greatest
fortune
in
all
the
west
for
you
i
have
kept
you
pure
and
sweet
and
good
and
to
think
that
such
a
fellow
should
dare
wayland
choked
with
anger
the
one
thing
i
can
not
stand
in
a
man
or
a
woman
is
immorality
i
have
lived
clean
myself
and
my
son
shall
be
as
clean
as
i
did
you
say
that
boyd
threatened
to
come
aboard
this
evening
questioned
the
girl
yes
but
i
swore
that
he
should
not
and
still
he
repeated
his
threat
mildred
eyes
were
strangely
bright
she
was
smiling
as
if
to
herself
he
did
the
braggart
he
had
better
not
try
it
then
he
come
said
mildred
it
was
twilight
when
willis
marsh
was
rowed
out
to
the
yacht
he
found
wayland
and
mildred
seated
in
enjoying
the
golden
sunset
while
the
old
man
smoked
marsh
explained
that
he
had
excused
himself
from
his
guests
to
go
whither
his
inclination
led
him
and
drew
his
seat
close
to
mildred
rejoicing
in
the
fact
that
no
one
could
gainsay
him
this
privilege
in
reality
he
had
been
drawn
to
grande
largely
by
a
lurking
fear
of
emerson
he
was
not
entirely
sure
of
the
girl
and
would
not
feel
secure
until
the
shores
of
kalvik
had
sunk
from
sight
and
his
rival
had
been
left
behind
but
in
spite
of
his
uneasiness
it
was
the
happiest
moment
of
his
life
if
he
had
failed
to
ruin
his
enemy
in
the
precise
way
he
had
planned
he
was
fairly
satisfied
with
what
he
had
accomplished
he
had
shifted
the
battle
to
stronger
shoulders
and
he
had
gained
the
woman
he
wanted
moreover
he
had
won
the
unfaltering
loyalty
of
wayne
wayland
the
dominant
figure
of
the
west
nothing
could
keep
him
now
from
the
success
his
ambition
demanded
it
added
to
his
satisfaction
to
note
the
group
of
lusty
sailors
at
the
rail
he
almost
wished
that
emerson
would
try
to
come
aboard
that
he
might
witness
his
discomfiture
meanwhile
he
did
his
best
to
be
pleasant
his
complaisant
enjoyment
was
interrupted
at
last
by
the
approach
of
the
second
officer
who
announced
that
a
lady
wished
to
see
wayland
a
lady
asked
the
old
man
in
surprise
yes
sir
she
came
alongside
in
a
small
boat
just
now
with
some
natives
i
stopped
her
at
the
landing
but
she
says
she
must
see
you
at
once
ah
that
woman
again
wayland
jaws
snapped
tell
her
to
begone
i
refuse
to
see
her
very
well
sir
the
mate
turned
but
mildred
said
suddenly
wait
why
do
you
talk
to
her
father
that
creature
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
her
quite
right
agreed
marsh
with
a
cautionary
glance
at
the
speaker
she
is
up
to
some
trick
she
may
have
something
really
important
to
say
to
you
urged
the
girl
no
mildred
leaned
forward
and
called
to
the
ship
officer
show
her
up
i
will
see
her
mildred
you
must
talk
to
that
woman
her
father
cried
it
is
very
unwise
marsh
chimed
in
apprehensively
she
is
the
sort
of
person
miss
wayland
chilled
him
with
a
look
and
waved
the
mate
away
then
sank
back
into
her
chair
i
have
talked
with
her
already
i
assure
you
she
is
not
dangerous
have
your
own
way
wayland
grunted
but
it
is
bound
to
lead
to
something
unpleasant
she
has
probably
come
with
a
message
from
that
fellow
willis
marsh
squirmed
uncomfortably
in
his
seat
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
knot
of
men
at
the
starboard
rail
an
expression
of
extreme
alertness
came
over
his
bland
features
his
feet
were
drawn
under
him
and
his
fingers
were
clinched
upon
the
arms
of
his
chair
then
with
a
sharp
indrawing
of
his
breath
he
leaped
up
and
darted
down
the
deck
over
the
side
had
come
cherry
malotte
accompanied
by
an
indian
girl
in
shawl
and
moccasins
a
slim
shrinking
creature
who
stood
as
if
bewildered
twisting
her
hands
and
staring
about
with
frightened
eyes
behind
them
head
and
shoulders
above
the
sailors
towered
a
giant
breed
with
a
child
in
his
arms
they
saw
that
marsh
was
speaking
to
the
newcomers
but
could
not
distinguish
his
words
the
indian
girl
fell
back
as
if
terrified
she
cried
out
something
in
her
own
tongue
shook
her
head
violently
and
pointed
to
her
white
companion
marsh
face
was
livid
he
shook
a
quivering
hand
in
cherry
malotte
face
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
strike
her
but
constantine
strode
between
them
scowling
silently
down
into
the
smaller
man
face
his
own
visage
saturnine
and
menacing
marsh
retreated
a
step
chattering
excitedly
then
cherry
voice
came
clearly
to
the
listeners
it
is
too
late
now
marsh
you
may
as
well
face
the
music
followed
by
the
stares
of
the
sailors
she
came
up
the
deck
toward
the
old
man
and
his
daughter
who
had
arisen
the
indian
girl
clinging
to
her
sleeve
the
tall
breed
striding
noiselessly
behind
willis
marsh
came
with
them
his
white
lips
writhing
his
face
like
putty
he
made
futile
detaining
grasps
at
constantine
and
in
the
silence
that
suddenly
descended
upon
the
ship
they
heard
him
whispering
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
demanded
wayland
i
heard
you
were
about
to
sail
so
i
came
out
to
see
you
before
marsh
broke
in
hoarsely
she
a
bad
woman
she
has
come
here
for
blackmail
blackmail
cried
wayne
wayland
i
thought
as
much
that
her
game
she
wants
money
cherry
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
showed
her
white
teeth
in
a
smile
marsh
anticipates
slightly
you
may
judge
if
he
is
right
marsh
started
to
speak
but
mildred
wayland
who
had
been
watching
him
intently
was
before
him
who
sent
you
here
miss
no
one
sent
me
if
marsh
will
stop
his
chatter
i
can
make
myself
understood
do
listen
to
her
cherry
turned
upon
him
swiftly
you
got
to
face
it
so
you
may
as
well
keep
still
he
fell
silent
we
heard
that
marsh
was
going
away
with
you
and
i
came
out
to
ask
him
for
enough
money
to
support
his
child
while
he
is
gone
his
child
wayne
wayland
turned
upon
his
daughter
fiance
with
a
face
of
stern
surprise
willis
tell
her
she
is
lying
she
lying
marsh
repeated
obediently
but
they
saw
the
truth
in
his
face
cherry
spoke
directly
to
miss
wayland
now
i
have
supported
this
little
fellow
and
his
mother
for
a
year
she
indicated
the
youngster
in
constantine
arms
that
is
all
i
care
to
do
when
you
people
arrived
marsh
induced
chakawana
to
take
the
baby
to
a
and
stay
there
until
you
had
gone
but
constantine
heard
that
he
intended
to
marry
you
and
hearing
also
that
he
intended
leaving
constantine
brought
his
sister
back
in
the
hope
that
marsh
would
do
what
is
right
you
see
he
promised
to
marry
chakawana
long
before
he
met
you
mildred
could
have
done
murder
at
the
expression
she
saw
in
face
this
woman
she
had
scorned
had
humbled
her
in
earnest
with
flashing
eyes
she
turned
upon
her
father
since
you
were
so
prompt
in
announcing
my
engagement
perhaps
you
can
deny
it
with
equal
promptness
good
god
what
a
scandal
if
this
is
true
wayne
wayland
wiped
his
forehead
oh
it
true
said
cherry
in
the
silence
that
followed
the
child
struggled
out
of
arms
and
stood
beside
his
mother
the
better
to
inspect
these
strangers
his
little
face
was
grimy
his
clothes
cut
in
the
native
fashion
were
poor
and
not
very
clean
yet
he
was
more
white
than
aleut
and
no
one
seeing
him
could
doubt
his
parentage
the
seamen
had
left
their
posts
and
were
watching
with
such
absorption
that
they
failed
to
see
a
skiff
with
a
single
oarsman
swing
past
the
stern
of
grande
and
make
fast
to
the
landing
still
unobserved
the
man
mounted
the
companionway
swiftly
for
once
in
his
life
wayne
wayland
was
too
confused
for
definite
speech
willis
marsh
stood
helpless
his
plump
face
and
beaded
with
sweat
he
could
not
yet
grasp
the
completeness
of
his
downfall
and
waited
anxiously
for
some
further
sign
from
mildred
it
came
at
last
in
a
look
that
scorched
him
firing
him
to
a
last
effort
do
believe
her
he
broke
out
she
is
lying
to
protect
her
own
lover
he
pointed
to
chakawana
that
girl

a
voice
behind
them

his
way
through
the
sailors

this
mildred

constantine
eyes
were
full
of
tears
as
he
strove
laboriously
to
voice
his
religious
teachings
he
went
on
with
growing
agitation
chakawana
she
mighty
scare
of
that
bad
place
and
she
ask

the
child

without
a
single
warning
cry
the
breed
lunged
swiftly
the
others
saw
something
gleam
in
his
hand
emerson
jumped
for
him
and
the
three
men
went
to
the
deck
in
a
writhing
tangle
sending
the
furniture
spinning
before
them
mildred
screamed
the
sailors
rushed
forward
pushing
her
aside
and
blotting
out
her
view
the
sudden
violence
of
the
assault
had
frightened
her
nearly
out
of
her
senses
she
fled
to
her
father
striving
to
hide
her
face
against
his
breast
but
something
drew
her
eyes
back
to
the
spot
where
the
men
were
clinched
she
heard
boyd
emerson
cry
to
the
sailors
get
out
of
the
way
i
got
him
then
saw
him
locked
in
the
arms
they
had
gained
their
feet
now
and
spun
backward
bringing
up
against
the
yacht
cabin
with
a
crash
of
shivering
glass
a
knife
wrenched
from
the
breed
grasp
went
whirling
over
the
side
into
the
sea
cherry
malotte
ran
forward
and
at
her
voice
the
savage
ceased
his
struggles
wayne
wayland
loosed
his
daughter
hold
and
thrust
his
way
in
among
the
sailors
kneeling
beside
the
man
he
had
chosen
for
his
emerson
joined
him
then
rose
quickly
crying
is
there
a
doctor
among
your
party
doctor
berry
send
for
berry
he
gone
ashore
exclaimed
wayland
quick
somebody
fetch
doctor
berry
boyd
directed
as
the
sailors
drew
apart
mildred
wayland
saw
a
sight
that
made
her
grow
deathly
faint
and
close
her
eyes
turning
she
fled
blindly
into
the
cabin
a
few
moments
later
emerson
found
her
stretched
unconscious
at
the
head
of
the
main
stairs
with
a
hysterical
french
maid
sobbing
over
her
chapter
xxvii
and
a
dream
comes
true
for
nearly
an
hour
boyd
emerson
sat
alone
on
the
deck
of
grande
a
prey
to
conflicting
emotions
the
while
he
waited
for
mildred
to
appear
there
was
no
one
to
dispute
his
presence
now
for
the
tourists
who
had
followed
doctor
berry
from
the
shore
in
hushed
excitement
avoided
him
and
the
sailors
made
no
effort
to
carry
out
their
earlier
instructions
hence
he
was
allowed
opportunity
to
adjust
himself
to
the
sudden
change
it
was
not
so
much
the
unexpected
downfall
of
willis
marsh
and
the
new
light
thus
thrown
upon
his
own
enterprise
that
upset
him
as
a
puzzling
alteration
in
his
own
purposes
and
inclinations
he
had
come
out
to
the
yacht
defiantly
to
make
good
his
threat
and
to
force
an
understanding
with
mildred
wayland
but
now
that
he
was
here
and
his
way
made
easy
he
began
to
question
his
own
desires
now
that
he
thought
about
it
that
note
instead
of
filling
him
with
dismay
had
rather
left
him
relieved
it
was
as
if
he
had
been
freed
of
a
burden
and
this
caused
him
a
vague
uneasiness
was
it
because
he
was
tired
by
the
struggle
for
this
girl
for
whom
he
had
labored
so
faithfully
after
three
years
of
unflagging
devotion
was
he
truly
relieved
to
have
her
dismiss
him
or
was
it
that
here
in
this
primal
country
stripped
of
all
conventions
he
saw
her
and
himself
in
a
new
light
he
did
not
know
the
late
twilight
was
fading
when
mildred
came
from
her
she
found
boyd
pacing
the
deck
a
cigar
between
his
teeth
where
are
those
people
she
inquired
they
went
ashore
marsh
does
care
to
press
a
charge
against
the
indian
i
hear
he
is
not
badly
hurt
after
all
that
is
true
but
it
was
a
close
shave
mildred
shuddered
it
was
horrible
i
never
dreamed
that
constantine
would
do
such
a
thing
but
he
is
more
russian
than
aleut
and
both
he
and
his
sister
are
completely
under
the
spell
of
the
priest
they
are
intensely
religious
and
their
idea
of
damnation
is
very
vivid
have
you
seen
father
we
had
a
short
talk
did
you
make
up
no
but
i
think
he
is
beginning
to
understand
things
better
at
least
as
far
as
marsh
is
concerned
the
rest
is
only
a
matter
of
time
what
a
frightful
situation
why
did
you
ever
let
father
announce
my
engagement
to
that
man
emerson
gazed
at
her
in
astonishment
i
pardon
me
how
could
i
help
it
you
might
have
avoided
quarrelling
with
him
i
think
you
are
very
inconsiderate
of
me
boyd
regarded
the
coal
of
his
cigar
with
a
slight
gleam
of
amusement
in
his
eyes
as
she
ran
on
even
that
woman
took
occasion
to
humiliate
me
in
the
worst
possible
way
it
strikes
me
that
she
did
you
a
very
great
service
i
have
no
doubt
it
was
quite
as
distasteful
to
her
as
to
you
absurd
it
was
her
chance
for
revenge
and
she
rejoiced
in
making
me
ridiculous
then
it
is
the
first
ignoble
thing
i
ever
knew
her
to
do
said
boyd
slowly
she
has
helped
me
in
a
hundred
ways
without
her
assistance
i
could
never
have
won
through
that
cannery
site
would
still
be
grown
up
to
moss
and
trees
and
i
would
still
be
a
disheartened
dreamer
it
very
nice
of
you
of
course
to
appreciate
what
she
has
done
but
she
ca
help
you
any
more
you
surely
do
intend
to
keep
up
your
acquaintance
with
her
now
he
made
no
reply
and
taking
his
silence
for
agreement
she
went
on
the
trip
home
will
be
terribly
dull
for
me
i
afraid
i
think
yes
i
shall
have
father
ask
you
to
go
back
with
us
but
i
am
right
in
the
midst
of
the
run
i
ca
leave
the
business
oh
business
do
you
care
more
for
business
than
for
me
i
do
think
you
realize
how
terribly
hard
for
me
all
this
has
been
i
still
frightened
i
shall
die
of
nervousness
without
some
one
to
talk
to
it
quite
impossible
i
do
want
to
go
back
now
indeed
and
no
doubt
it
was
impossible
for
you
to
come
out
here
last
night
for
the
same
reason
it
was
the
fish
struck
in
and
i
could
not
leave
it
was
that
woman
who
kept
you
cried
mildred
it
is
because
of
her
that
you
refuse
to
leave
this
country
please
do
he
said
quietly
i
have
never
thought
of
her
in
that
way
then
come
away
from
this
wretched
place
i
detest
the
whole
country
the
fisheries
the
people
everything
this
is
your
proper
sphere
why
come
away
now
at
once
and
begin
something
new
something
worth
while
do
you
realize
the
hopes
the
heartaches
the
vital
effort
i
have
put
into
this
enterprise
he
questioned
but
she
only
said
i
do
like
it
it
is
a
nice
business
let
father
take
the
plant
over
if
you
need
money
i
have
plenty
wait
he
interrupted
sharply
sit
down
i
want
to
talk
to
you
he
drew
the
wrap
closer
about
her
shoulders
and
led
her
to
a
the
change
in
him
was
becoming
more
apparent
he
knew
now
that
he
had
never
felt
the
same
since
his
first
meeting
with
mildred
upon
the
arrival
of
grande
even
then
she
had
repelled
him
by
her
lack
of
sympathy
she
had
shown
no
understanding
of
his
efforts
and
now
she
revealed
as
complete
a
failure
to
grasp
his
code
of
honor
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
any
loyalty
of
man
to
man
could
offset
her
simple
will
she
did
not
see
that
his
desertion
of
george
would
be
nothing
short
of
treachery
it
seemed
to
him
all
at
once
that
they
had
little
in
common
she
was
wrapped
completely
in
the
web
of
her
own
desires
she
would
make
her
prejudices
a
law
for
him
above
all
she
could
not
respond
to
the
exultation
of
his
success
she
had
no
conception
of
the
pride
of
accomplishment
that
is
the
wine
of
every
true
man
life
he
had
waged
a
bitter
fight
that
had
sapped
his
very
soul
he
had
made
and
won
the
struggle
that
a
man
makes
once
in
a
lifetime
and
now
just
when
he
had
proved
himself
strong
and
fair
in
the
sight
of
his
fellows
she
asked
him
to
forego
it
all
engrossed
in
her
own
egoism
she
required
of
him
a
greater
sacrifice
than
any
he
had
made
now
that
he
had
shown
his
strength
she
wanted
to
load
him
down
with
golden
fetters
to
make
him
a
dependent
was
it
because
she
feared
another
girl
she
had
tried
to
help
him
he
knew
in
her
way
and
the
thought
of
it
touched
him
that
was
like
the
mildred
he
had
always
known
to
act
fearlessly
heedless
of
what
her
father
might
do
or
say
somehow
he
had
never
felt
more
convinced
of
the
sincerity
of
her
love
but
he
found
himself
thinking
of
it
as
of
something
of
the
past
after
all
what
she
had
done
had
been
little
considering
her
power
she
had
given
carelessly
out
of
her
abundance
while
cherry
he
saw
it
all
now
and
a
sudden
sense
of
loyalty
and
devotion
to
the
girl
who
had
really
shared
his
struggles
swept
over
him
in
a
warm
tide
it
was
most
unlike
his
distant
worship
of
mildred
she
had
been
his
dream
but
the
other
was
bone
of
his
bone
and
flesh
of
his
flesh
for
a
long
time
the
two
sat
talking
while
these
thoughts
took
gradual
form
in
the
young
man
mind
and
although
the
deck
was
deserted
miss
wayland
had
no
need
now
to
curb
her
once
headstrong
wooer
he
could
not
put
into
words
the
change
that
was
working
in
him
but
she
saw
it
and
grasping
its
meaning
at
last
she
began
to
battle
like
a
mother
for
her
child
his
awakening
had
been
slow
and
hers
was
even
slower
but
once
she
found
her
power
over
him
waning
her
sense
of
loss
grew
and
grew
as
he
failed
to
answer
to
her
appeal
womanlike
she
capitulated
at
last
what
matter
if
he
stayed
here
where
his
hopes
were
centred
this
life
in
the
north
had
claimed
him
and
she
would
wait
until
he
came
for
her
but
still
he
did
not
respond
and
it
was
not
long
until
she
had
persuaded
herself
that
his
battle
with
the
wilderness
had
put
red
blood
into
his
veins
and
his
conduct
had
been
no
worse
than
that
of
other
men
finally
she
tried
to
voice
these
thoughts
but
she
only
led
him
to
a
stiff
denial
of
the
charges
she
wished
to
forgive
as
she
saw
him
slipping
further
away
from
her
she
summoned
all
her
arts
to
rekindle
the
flame
which
had
burned
so
steadily
and
when
these
failed
she
surrendered
every
prejudice
it
was
his
love
she
wanted
all
else
was
secondary
at
last
she
knew
herself
she
could
have
cried
at
the
sudden
realization
that
he
had
not
kissed
her
since
their
parting
in
chicago
and
when
she
saw
he
had
no
will
to
do
so
the
memory
of
his
last
embrace
arose
to
torture
her
she
was
almost
glad
when
a
launch
bringing
her
father
came
from
the
shore
and
the
old
man
joined
them
the
two
men
bore
themselves
with
unbending
formality
unable
as
yet
to
forget
their
mutual
wrongs
the
interruption
gave
boyd
the
opportunity
he
had
not
been
brave
enough
to
make
and
he
bade
them
both
for
the
tide
was
at
its
flood
and
the
hour
of
their
departure
was
at
hand
there
was
a
meaningless
exchange
of
words
and
a
handshake
in
the
glare
from
the
cabin
lights
that
showed
mildred
pallid
lips
and
frightened
eyes
then
emerson
went
over
the
side
and
the
darkness
swallowed
him
up
the
girl
clutched
at
her
father
arm
standing
as
if
frozen
while
the
creak
of
rowlocks
grew
fainter
and
fainter
and
died
away
then
she
turned
you
see
he
came
she
said
the
old
man
saw
the
agony
that
blanched
her
cheeks
and
answered
gently
yes
daughter
he
struggled
with
himself
and
if
you
wish
it
he
may
come
again
but
he
wo
come
again
that
is
what
makes
it
so
hard
he
will
never
come
back
she
turned
away
but
not
quickly
enough
to
keep
him
from
seeing
that
her
eyes
were
wet
wayne
wayland
beheld
what
he
would
have
given
half
his
mighty
fortune
to
prevent
he
cried
out
angrily
but
she
anticipated
his
thought
no
no
you
must
never
injure
him
again
for
he
was
right
and
we
were
wrong
you
see
i
could
understand
he
left
her
staring
into
the
night
and
walked
heavily
below
emerson
felt
a
great
sense
of
relief
and
deliverance
as
he
leaned
against
his
oars
his
heart
sang
to
the
murmur
of
the
waters
overside
for
the
first
time
in
many
months
he
felt
young
and
free
how
blind
he
had
been
and
how
narrow
had
been
his
escape
from
a
life
that
could
lead
to
but
one
result
the
girl
was
sweet
and
good
and
wonderful
in
many
ways
but
three
years
had
altered
him
more
than
he
had
realized
he
had
begun
to
understand
himself
that
very
afternoon
when
cherry
had
told
him
her
own
unhappy
secret
the
shock
of
her
disclosure
had
roused
him
from
his
dream
and
once
he
began
to
see
himself
as
he
really
was
the
rest
had
come
quickly
he
had
been
doubtful
even
when
he
went
out
to
the
yacht
but
what
happened
there
had
destroyed
the
last
trace
of
uncertainty
he
knew
that
for
him
there
was
but
one
woman
in
all
the
world
it
was
no
easy
battle
he
had
fought
with
himself
he
had
been
reared
to
respect
the
conventions
and
he
knew
that
cherry
life
had
not
been
all
he
could
wish
but
he
fronted
the
issue
squarely
and
tried
to
throttle
his
inbred
prejudice
although
he
had
felt
the
truth
of
fraser
arguments
and
of
cherry
own
words
he
had
still
refused
to
yield
until
his
love
for
the
girl
swept
over
him
in
all
its
power
then
he
made
his
choice
the
one
thing
he
found
most
difficult
to
accept
was
her
conduct
with
hilliard
those
other
charges
against
the
girl
were
vague
and
shadowy
but
this
was
concrete
and
he
was
familiar
with
every
miserable
detail
of
it
it
took
all
his
courage
to
face
it
but
he
swore
savagely
that
if
the
conditions
had
been
reversed
cherry
would
not
have
faltered
for
an
instant
moreover
what
she
had
done
had
been
done
for
love
of
him
it
was
worse
than
vile
to
hesitate
her
past
was
her
own
and
all
he
could
rightfully
claim
was
her
future
he
shut
his
teeth
and
laid
his
course
resolutely
for
her
landing
striving
to
leave
behind
this
one
hideous
memory
centring
his
mind
upon
the
girl
herself
and
shutting
out
her
past
it
was
the
bitterest
fight
he
had
ever
waged
but
when
he
reached
the
shore
and
tied
his
skiff
he
was
exalted
by
the
knowledge
that
he
had
triumphed
that
this
painful
episode
was
locked
away
with
all
the
others
now
that
he
had
conquered
he
was
filled
with
a
consuming
eagerness
as
he
stole
up
through
the
shadows
he
heard
her
playing
and
when
he
drew
nearer
he
recognized
the
notes
of
that
song
that
had
banished
his
own
black
desolation
on
the
night
of
their
first
meeting
he
paused
outside
the
open
window
and
saw
by
the
shaded
lamplight
that
she
was
playing
from
memory
her
fingers
wandering
over
the
keyboard
without
conscious
effort
then
she
took
up
the
words
with
all
the
throbbing
tenderness
that
lives
in
a
deep
contralto
voice
last
night
i
was
dreaming
of
thee
love
was
dreaming
i
dreamed
thou
didst
promise
cherry
paused
as
if
entranced
for
she
thought
she
heard
another
voice
join
with
hers
then
she
bowed
her
head
and
sobbed
in
utter
wretchedness
knowing
it
for
nothing
more
than
her
own
fancy
too
many
times
as
in
other
twilights
past
she
had
heard
that
mellow
voice
blend
with
hers
only
to
find
that
her
ears
had
played
her
false
and
she
was
alone
with
a
memory
that
would
never
die
of
all
the
days
of
her
life
this
was
the
saddest
this
hour
the
loneliest
and
the
tears
she
had
withheld
so
bravely
as
long
as
there
was
work
to
do
came
now
in
unbidden
profusion
to
face
those
people
on
the
yacht
had
been
an
act
of
pure
devotion
to
boyd
for
her
every
instinct
had
rebelled
against
it
yet
she
had
known
that
some
desperate
stroke
in
his
defence
must
be
delivered
instantly
otherwise
the
ruin
of
all
his
hopes
would
follow
she
had
hit
upon
the
device
of
using
constantine
and
chakawana
largely
by
chance
for
not
until
the
previous
day
had
she
learned
the
truth
she
had
not
dared
to
hope
for
such
unqualified
success
nor
had
she
foreseen
the
tragic
outcome
she
had
simply
carried
her
plan
through
to
its
natural
conclusion
now
that
her
work
was
done
she
gave
way
completely
and
wept
like
a
little
girl
he
was
out
there
now
with
his
love
they
would
never
waste
a
thought
upon
that
other
girl
who
had
made
their
happiness
possible
the
thought
was
almost
more
than
she
could
bear
never
again
could
she
have
boyd
to
herself
never
enjoy
his
careless
friendship
as
of
old
even
that
was
over
now
that
he
knew
the
truth
the
first
and
only
kiss
he
had
ever
given
her
burned
fresh
upon
her
lips
she
recalled
that
evening
they
had
spent
alone
in
this
very
room
when
he
had
seemed
to
waver
and
her
hopes
had
risen
at
the
dawning
of
a
new
light
in
his
eyes
at
the
memory
she
cried
aloud
as
if
her
heart
would
break
boyd
boyd
he
entered
noiselessly
and
took
her
in
his
arms
yes
dear
he
murmured
but
she
rose
with
a
startled
exclamation
and
wrenched
herself
from
his
embrace
the
piano
gave
forth
a
discordant
crash
shrinking
back
as
from
an
apparition
she
stared
into
his
flushed
and
smiling
face
then
breathed
you
why
are
you
here
because
i
love
you
she
closed
her
eyes
and
swayed
as
if
under
the
spell
of
wonderful
music
he
saw
the
throbbing
pulse
at
her
throat
then
she
flung
out
her
hands
crying
piteously
go
away
please
before
i
find
it
is
only
another
dream
she
raised
her
lids
to
find
him
still
standing
there
then
felt
him
with
fluttering
fingers
our
dreams
have
come
true
he
said
gently
and
strove
to
imprison
her
hand
no
no
her
voice
broke
wildly
you
do
mean
it
you
you
come
to
stay
i
have
come
to
stay
if
you
will
let
me
dear
she
broke
from
his
grasp
and
moved
quickly
away
why
are
you
here
i
left
you
out
there
with
her
i
made
your
way
clear
why
have
you
come
back
what
more
can
i
do
dear
god
what
more
can
i
do
she
was
panting
as
if
desperately
frightened
there
is
but
one
thing
more
you
can
do
to
make
me
happy
you
can
be
my
wife
but
i
do
understand
she
shook
her
head
hopelessly
you
are
jesting
with
me
you
love
miss
wayland
no
miss
wayland
leaves
and
i
shall
never
see
her
again
then
you
wo
marry
her
no
a
dull
color
rose
to
cherry
malotte
cheeks
she
swallowed
as
if
her
throat
were
very
dry
and
said
slowly
then
she
refused
you
in
spite
of
everything
and
you
have
come
to
me
because
of
what
i
told
you
this
afternoon
you
are
doing
this
out
of
pity
or
is
it
because
you
are
angry
with
her
no
no
boyd
i
have
it
i
do
want
your
pity
i
do
want
what
she
cast
off
it
has
taken
me
a
long
time
to
find
myself
cherry
for
i
have
been
blinded
by
a
vision
he
answered
i
have
been
dreaming
and
i
never
saw
clearly
till
i
came
away
of
my
own
free
will
and
i
came
straight
to
you
because
it
is
you
i
love
and
shall
always
love
the
girl
suddenly
began
to
beat
her
hands
together
you
forget
what
i
have
been
she
cried
in
a
voice
that
tore
her
lover
heartstrings
you
ca
want
to
marry
me
he
said
simply
and
held
out
his
arms
to
her
i
love
you
and
i
want
you
that
is
all
i
know
or
care
about
he
found
her
upon
his
breast
sobbing
and
shaking
as
if
she
had
sought
shelter
there
from
some
great
peril
he
buried
his
face
in
the
soft
masses
of
her
hair
whispering
fondly
to
her
till
her
emotion
spent
itself
she
turned
her
face
shyly
up
at
length
and
pressed
her
lips
to
his
then
holding
herself
away
from
him
she
said
with
a
yet
radiant
look
it
is
not
too
late
yet
i
will
give
you
one
final
chance
to
save
yourself
he
shook
his
head
then
i
have
done
my
duty
she
snuggled
closer
to
him
and
you
have
no
regrets
only
one
i
am
sorry
that
i
ca
give
you
more
than
my
name
i
may
have
to
go
out
into
the
world
and
begin
all
over
if
wayland
carries
out
his
threat
i
may
be
the
poorest
of
the
poor
that
will
be
my
opportunity
to
show
how
well
i
love
you
you
can
be
no
poorer
than
i
in
this
world
goods
you
at
least
have
your
i
have
no
mine
said
the
girl
not
even
the
smallest
interest
in
one
but
i
do
understand
she
dropped
her
eyes
hilliard
is
a
hard
man
to
deal
with
i
had
to
give
him
all
my
share
in
the
claims
i
suppose
you
mean
you
sold
out
to
him
no
when
i
found
you
could
not
raise
the
money
i
gave
him
my
share
in
the
mine
with
that
as
a
consideration
he
made
you
the
loan
you
are
not
angry
are
you
angry
emerson
tone
conveyed
a
supreme
gladness
you
know
how
happy
you
have
made
me
hark
she
laid
a
finger
upon
his
lips
through
the
breathless
night
there
came
the
faint
rumble
of
a
ship
chains
grande
dame
he
cried
she
sails
at
the
flood
tide
they
stood
together
in
the
open
doorway
of
the
little
house
and
watched
the
yacht
lights
as
they
described
a
great
curve
through
the
darkness
then
slowly
faded
into
nothingness
down
the
bay
cherry
drew
herself
closer
to
boyd
what
a
wonderful
providence
guides
us
after
all
she
said
that
girl
had
everything
in
the
world
and
i
was
poor
so
poor
until
this
hour
god
grant
she
may
some
day
be
as
rich
as
i
out
on
grande
the
girl
who
had
everything
in
the
world
maintained
a
lonely
vigil
at
the
rail
straining
with
tragic
eyes
until
the
sombre
shadows
that
marked
the
shores
of
the
land
she
feared
had
shrunk
to
a
faint
streak
on
the
horizon
then
she
turned
and
went
below
numbed
by
the
knowledge
that
she
was
very
poor
and
very
wretched
and
had
never
understood
the
end
