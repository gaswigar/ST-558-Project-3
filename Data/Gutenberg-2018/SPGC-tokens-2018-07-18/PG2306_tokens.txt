preface
and
dedication
to
the
new
edition
to
arthur
barbette
frost
dear
frost
i
am
expected
to
supply
a
preface
for
this
new
edition
of
my
first
book
to
advance
from
behind
the
curtain
as
it
were
and
make
a
fresh
bow
to
the
public
that
has
dealt
with
uncle
remus
in
so
gentle
and
generous
a
fashion
for
this
event
the
lights
are
to
be
rekindled
and
i
am
expected
to
respond
in
some
formal
way
to
an
encore
that
marks
the
fifteenth
anniversary
of
the
book
there
have
been
other
editions
how
many
i
do
not
remember
but
this
is
to
be
an
entirely
new
one
except
as
to
the
matter
new
type
new
pictures
and
new
binding
but
as
frequently
happens
on
such
occasions
i
am
at
a
loss
for
a
word
i
seem
to
see
before
me
the
smiling
faces
of
thousands
of
children
some
young
and
fresh
and
some
wearing
the
friendly
marks
of
age
but
all
children
at
heart
and
not
an
unfriendly
face
among
them
and
out
of
the
confusion
and
while
i
am
trying
hard
to
speak
the
right
word
i
seem
to
hear
a
voice
lifted
above
the
rest
saying
you
have
made
some
of
us
happy
and
so
i
feel
my
heart
fluttering
and
my
lips
trembling
and
i
have
to
how
silently
and
him
away
and
hurry
back
into
the
obscurity
that
fits
me
best
phantoms
children
of
dreams
true
my
dear
frost
but
if
you
could
see
the
thousands
of
letters
that
have
come
to
me
from
far
and
near
and
all
fresh
from
the
hearts
and
hands
of
children
and
from
men
and
women
who
have
not
forgotten
how
to
be
children
you
would
not
wonder
at
the
dream
and
such
a
dream
can
do
no
harm
insubstantial
though
it
may
be
i
would
not
at
this
hour
exchange
it
for
all
the
fame
won
by
my
mightier
brethren
of
the
pen
whom
i
most
humbly
salute
measured
by
the
material
developments
that
have
compressed
years
of
experience
into
the
space
of
a
day
thus
increasing
the
possibilities
of
life
if
not
its
beauty
fifteen
years
constitute
the
old
age
of
a
book
such
a
survival
might
almost
be
said
to
be
due
to
a
tiny
sluice
of
green
sap
under
the
gray
bark
where
it
lies
in
the
matter
of
this
book
or
what
its
source
if
indeed
it
be
really
there
is
more
of
a
mystery
to
my
middle
age
than
it
was
to
my
prime
but
it
would
be
no
mystery
at
all
if
this
new
edition
were
to
be
more
popular
than
the
old
one
do
you
know
why
because
you
have
taken
it
under
your
hand
and
made
it
yours
because
you
have
breathed
the
breath
of
life
into
these
amiable
brethren
of
wood
and
field
because
by
a
stroke
here
and
a
touch
there
you
have
conveyed
into
their
quaint
antics
the
illumination
of
your
own
inimitable
humor
which
is
as
true
to
our
sun
and
soil
as
it
is
to
the
spirit
and
essence
of
the
matter
set
forth
the
book
was
mine
but
now
you
have
made
it
yours
both
sap
and
pith
take
it
therefore
my
dear
frost
and
believe
me
faithfully
yours
joel
chandler
harris
introduction
i
am
advised
by
my
publishers
that
this
book
is
to
be
included
in
their
catalogue
of
humorous
publications
and
this
friendly
warning
gives
me
an
opportunity
to
say
that
however
humorous
it
may
be
in
effect
its
intention
is
perfectly
serious
and
even
if
it
were
otherwise
it
seems
to
me
that
a
volume
written
wholly
in
dialect
must
have
its
solemn
not
to
say
melancholy
features
with
respect
to
the
scenes
my
purpose
has
been
to
preserve
the
legends
themselves
in
their
original
simplicity
and
to
wed
them
permanently
to
the
quaint
dialect
if
indeed
it
can
be
called
a
dialect
through
the
medium
of
which
they
have
become
a
part
of
the
domestic
history
of
every
southern
family
and
i
have
endeavored
to
give
to
the
whole
a
genuine
flavor
of
the
old
plantation
each
legend
has
its
variants
but
in
every
instance
i
have
retained
that
particular
version
which
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
most
characteristic
and
have
given
it
without
embellishment
and
without
exaggeration
the
dialect
it
will
be
observed
is
wholly
different
from
that
of
the
hon
pompey
smash
and
his
literary
descendants
and
different
also
from
the
intolerable
misrepresentations
of
the
minstrel
stage
but
it
is
at
least
phonetically
genuine
nevertheless
if
the
language
of
uncle
remus
fails
to
give
vivid
hints
of
the
really
poetic
imagination
of
the
negro
if
it
fails
to
embody
the
quaint
and
homely
humor
which
was
his
most
prominent
characteristic
if
it
does
not
suggest
a
certain
picturesque
sensitiveness
a
curious
exaltation
of
mind
and
temperament
not
to
be
defined
by
words
then
i
have
reproduced
the
form
of
the
dialect
merely
and
not
the
essence
and
my
attempt
may
be
accounted
a
failure
at
any
rate
i
trust
i
have
been
successful
in
presenting
what
must
be
at
least
to
a
large
portion
of
american
readers
a
new
and
by
no
means
unattractive
phase
of
negro
character
a
phase
which
may
be
considered
a
curiously
sympathetic
supplement
to
stowe
wonderful
defense
of
slavery
as
it
existed
in
the
south
stowe
let
me
hasten
to
say
attacked
the
possibilities
of
slavery
with
all
the
eloquence
of
genius
but
the
same
genius
painted
the
portrait
of
the
southern
and
defended
him
a
number
of
the
plantation
legends
originally
appeared
in
the
columns
of
a
daily
newspaper
the
atlanta
constitution
and
in
that
shape
they
attracted
the
attention
of
various
gentlemen
who
were
kind
enough
to
suggest
that
they
would
prove
to
be
valuable
contributions
to
it
is
but
fair
to
say
that
ethnological
considerations
formed
no
part
of
the
undertaking
which
has
resulted
in
the
publication
of
this
volume
professor
powell
of
the
smithsonian
institution
who
is
engaged
in
an
investigation
of
the
mythology
of
the
north
american
indians
informs
me
that
some
of
uncle
remus
stories
appear
in
a
number
of
different
languages
and
in
various
modified
forms
among
the
indians
and
he
is
of
the
opinion
that
they
are
borrowed
by
the
negroes
from
the
but
this
to
say
the
least
is
extremely
doubtful
since
another
investigator
herbert
smith
author
of
brazil
and
the
amazons
has
met
with
some
of
these
stories
among
tribes
of
south
american
indians
and
one
in
particular
he
has
traced
to
india
and
as
far
east
as
siam
smith
has
been
kind
enough
to
send
me
the
of
his
chapter
on
the
myths
and
of
the
amazonian
indians
in
which
he
reproduces
some
of
the
stories
which
he
gathered
while
exploring
the
amazons
in
the
first
of
his
series
a
tortoise
falls
from
a
tree
upon
the
head
of
a
jaguar
and
kills
him
in
one
of
uncle
remus
stories
the
terrapin
falls
from
a
shelf
in
miss
meadows
house
and
stuns
the
fox
so
that
the
latter
fails
to
catch
the
rabbit
in
the
next
a
jaguar
catches
a
tortoise
by
the
as
he
is
disappearing
in
his
hole
but
the
tortoise
convinces
him
he
is
holding
a
root
and
so
escapes
uncle
remus
tells
how
the
fox
endeavored
to
drown
the
terrapin
but
turned
him
loose
because
the
terrapin
declared
his
tail
to
be
only
a
smith
also
gives
the
story
of
how
the
tortoise
outran
the
deer
which
is
identical
as
to
incident
with
uncle
remus
story
of
how
brer
tarrypin
outran
brer
rabbit
then
there
is
the
story
of
how
the
tortoise
pretended
that
he
was
stronger
than
the
tapir
he
tells
the
latter
he
can
drag
him
into
the
sea
but
the
tapir
retorts
that
he
will
pull
the
tortoise
into
the
forest
and
kill
him
besides
the
tortoise
thereupon
gets
a
ties
one
end
around
the
body
of
the
tapir
and
goes
to
the
sea
where
he
ties
the
other
end
to
the
tail
of
a
whale
he
then
goes
into
the
wood
midway
between
them
both
and
gives
the
vine
a
shake
as
a
signal
for
the
pulling
to
begin
the
struggle
between
the
whale
and
tapir
goes
on
until
each
thinks
the
tortoise
is
the
strongest
of
animals
compare
this
with
the
story
of
the
terrapin
contest
with
the
bear
in
which
miss
meadows
is
used
instead
of
a
one
of
the
most
characteristic
of
uncle
stories
is
that
in
which
the
rabbit
proves
to
miss
meadows
and
the
girls
that
the
fox
is
his
this
is
almost
identical
with
a
story
quoted
by
smith
where
the
jaguar
is
about
to
marry
the
deer
daughter
the
cotia
a
species
of
rodent
is
also
in
love
with
her
and
he
tells
the
deer
that
he
can
make
a
of
the
jaguar
well
says
the
deer
if
you
can
make
the
jaguar
carry
you
you
shall
have
my
daughter
thereupon
the
story
proceeds
pretty
much
as
uncle
remus
tells
it
of
the
fox
and
rabbit
the
cotia
finally
jumps
from
the
jaguar
and
takes
refuge
in
a
hole
where
an
owl
is
set
to
watch
him
but
he
flings
sand
in
the
owl
eyes
and
escapes
in
another
story
given
by
smith
the
cotia
is
very
thirsty
and
seeing
a
man
coming
with
a
jar
on
his
head
lies
down
in
the
road
in
front
of
him
and
repeats
this
until
the
man
puts
down
his
jar
to
go
back
after
all
the
dead
cotias
he
has
seen
this
is
almost
identical
with
uncle
remus
story
of
how
the
rabbit
robbed
the
fox
of
his
game
in
a
story
from
upper
egypt
a
fox
lies
down
in
the
road
in
front
of
a
man
who
is
carrying
fowls
to
market
and
finally
succeeds
in
securing
them
this
similarity
extends
to
almost
every
story
quoted
by
smith
and
some
are
so
nearly
identical
as
to
point
unmistakably
to
a
common
origin
but
when
and
where
when
did
the
negro
or
the
north
american
indian
ever
come
in
contact
with
the
tribes
of
south
america
upon
this
point
the
author
of
brazil
and
the
amazons
who
is
engaged
in
making
a
critical
and
comparative
study
of
these
writes
i
am
not
prepared
to
form
a
theory
about
these
stories
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
some
of
them
found
among
the
negroes
and
the
indians
had
a
common
origin
the
most
natural
solution
would
be
to
suppose
that
they
originated
in
africa
and
were
carried
to
south
america
by
the
negro
slaves
they
are
certainly
found
among
the
red
negroes
but
unfortunately
for
the
african
theory
it
is
equally
certain
that
they
are
told
by
savage
indians
of
the
amazons
valley
away
up
on
the
tapajos
red
negro
and
tapura
these
indians
hardly
ever
see
a
negro
and
their
languages
are
very
distinct
from
the
broken
portuguese
spoken
by
the
slaves
the
form
of
the
stories
as
recounted
in
the
tupi
and
languages
seems
to
show
that
they
were
originally
formed
in
those
languages
or
have
long
been
adopted
in
them
it
is
interesting
to
find
a
story
from
upper
egypt
that
of
the
fox
who
pretended
to
be
dead
identical
with
an
amazonian
story
and
strongly
resembling
one
found
by
you
among
the
negroes
vambagen
the
brazilian
historian
now
visconde
de
rio
branco
tried
to
prove
a
relationship
between
the
ancient
egyptians
or
other
turanian
stock
and
the
tupi
indians
his
theory
rested
on
rather
a
slender
basis
yet
it
must
be
confessed
that
he
had
one
or
two
strong
points
do
the
resemblances
between
old
and
new
world
stories
point
to
a
similar
conclusion
it
would
be
hard
to
say
with
the
material
that
we
now
have
one
thing
is
certain
the
animal
stories
told
by
the
negroes
in
our
southern
states
and
in
brazil
were
brought
by
them
from
africa
whether
they
originated
there
or
with
the
arabs
or
egyptians
or
with
yet
more
ancient
nations
must
still
be
an
open
question
whether
the
indians
got
them
from
the
negroes
or
from
some
earlier
source
is
equally
uncertain
we
have
seen
enough
to
know
that
a
very
interesting
line
of
investigation
has
been
opened
professor
hartt
in
his
amazonian
tortoise
myths
quotes
a
story
from
the
riverside
magazine
of
november
which
will
be
recognized
as
a
variant
of
one
given
by
uncle
remus
i
venture
to
append
it
here
with
some
necessary
verbal
and
phonetic
alterations
in
order
to
give
the
reader
an
idea
of
the
difference
between
the
dialect
of
the
cotton
plantations
as
used
by
uncle
remus
and
the
lingo
in
vogue
on
the
rice
plantations
and
sea
islands
of
the
south
atlantic
states
one
time
deer
an

de

the
story
of
the
rabbit
and
the
fox
as
told
by
the
southern
negroes
is
artistically
dramatic
in
this
it
progresses
in
an
orderly
way
from
a
beginning
to
a
conclusion
and
is
full
of
striking
episodes
that
suggest
the
culmination
it
seems
to
me
to
be
to
a
certain
extent
allegorical
albeit
such
an
interpretation
may
be
unreasonable
at
least
it
is
a
fable
thoroughly
characteristic
of
the
negro
and
it
needs
no
scientific
investigation
to
show
why
he
selects
as
his
hero
the
weakest
and
most
harmless
of
all
animals
and
brings
him
out
victorious
in
contests
with
the
bear
the
wolf
and
the
fox
it
is
not
virtue
that
triumphs
but
helplessness
it
is
not
malice
but
mischievousness
it
would
be
presumptuous
in
me
to
offer
an
opinion
as
to
the
origin
of
these
curious
but
if
ethnologists
should
discover
that
they
did
not
originate
with
the
african
the
proof
to
that
effect
should
be
accompanied
with
a
good
deal
of
persuasive
eloquence
curiously
enough
i
have
found
few
negroes
who
will
acknowledge
to
a
stranger
that
they
know
anything
of
these
legends
and
yet
to
relate
one
of
the
stories
is
the
surest
road
to
their
confidence
and
esteem
in
this
way
and
in
this
way
only
i
have
been
enabled
to
collect
and
verify
the
folklore
included
in
this
volume
there
is
an
anecdote
about
the
irishman
and
the
rabbit
which
a
number
of
negroes
have
told
to
me
with
great
unction
and
which
is
both
funny
and
characteristic
though
i
will
not
undertake
to
say
that
it
has
its
origin
with
the
blacks
one
day
an
irishman
who
had
heard
people
talking
about
mares
nests
was
going
along
the
big
road
it
is
always
the
big
road
in
contradistinction
to
neighborhood
paths
and
called
in
the
vernacular
when
he
came
to
a
pumpkin
patch
the
irishman
had
never
seen
any
of
this
fruit
before
and
he
at
once
concluded
that
he
had
discovered
a
veritable
mare
nest
making
the
most
of
his
opportunity
he
gathered
one
of
the
pumpkins
in
his
arms
and
went
on
his
way
a
pumpkin
is
an
exceedingly
awkward
thing
to
carry
and
the
irishman
had
not
gone
far
before
he
made
a
misstep
and
stumbled
the
pumpkin
fell
to
the
ground
rolled
down
the
hill
into
a
brush
heap
and
striking
against
a
stump
was
broken
the
story
continues
in
the
dialect
de

he

en
holler
colty
kworp
colty
but
de
rabbit
he
des
flew
the
point
of
this
is
obvious
as
to
the
songs
the
reader
is
warned
that
it
will
be
found
difficult
to
make
them
conform
to
the
ordinary
rules
of
versification
nor
is
it
intended
that
they
should
so
conform
they
are
written
and
are
intended
to
be
read
solely
with
reference
to
the
regular
and
invariable
recurrence
of
the
caesura
as
for
instance
the
first
stanza
of
the
revival
hymn
oh
whar
shill
we

out

en
fine
no

ter

gold
en

in
other
words
the
songs
depend
for
their
melody
and
rhythm
upon
the
musical
quality
of
time
and
not
upon
long
or
short
accented
or
unaccented
syllables
i
am
persuaded
that
this
fact
led
sidney
lanier
who
is
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
metrical
peculiarities
of
negro
songs
into
the
exhaustive
investigation
which
has
resulted
in
the
publication
of
his
scholarly
treatise
on
the
science
of
english
verse
the
difference
between
the
dialect
of
the
legends
and
that
of
the
character
sketches
slight
as
it
is
marks
the
modifications
which
the
speech
of
the
negro
has
undergone
even
where
education
has
played
in
deed
save
in
the
no
part
reforming
it
indeed
save
in
the
remote
country
districts
the
dialect
of
the
legends
has
nearly
disappeared
i
am
perfectly
well
aware
that
the
character
sketches
are
without
permanent
interest
but
they
are
embodied
here
for
the
purpose
of
presenting
a
phase
of
negro
character
wholly
distinct
from
that
which
i
have
endeavored
to
preserve
in
the
legends
only
in
this
shape
and
with
all
the
local
allusions
would
it
be
possible
to
adequately
represent
the
shrewd
observations
the
curious
retorts
the
homely
thrusts
the
quaint
comments
and
the
humorous
philosophy
of
the
race
of
which
uncle
remus
is
the
type
if
the
reader
not
familiar
with
plantation
life
will
imagine
that
the
myth
stories
of
uncle
remus
are
told
night
after
night
to
a
little
boy
by
an
old
negro
who
appears
to
be
venerable
enough
to
have
lived
during
the
period
which
he
describes
who
has
nothing
but
pleasant
memories
of
the
discipline
of
slavery
and
who
has
all
the
prejudices
of
caste
and
pride
of
family
that
were
the
natural
results
of
the
system
if
the
reader
can
imagine
all
this
he
will
find
little
difficulty
in
appreciating
and
sympathizing
with
the
air
of
affectionate
superiority
which
uncle
remus
assumes
as
he
proceeds
to
unfold
the
mysteries
of
plantation
lore
to
a
little
child
who
is
the
product
of
that
practical
reconstruction
which
has
been
going
on
to
some
extent
since
the
war
in
spite
of
the
politicians
uncle
remus
describes
that
reconstruction
in
his
story
of
the
war
and
i
may
as
well
add
here
for
the
benefit
of
the
curious

making

and
through

yard
she
heard
the
sound
of
voices
in

looking
through

window
saw
the
child
sitting
by
uncle

his

rested
against

and
he
was
gazing
with
an
expression

rough
face
that
beamed

the

produced
by

stones
in
rapid
succession
into
a
pond
of
deep
water
may
be
able
to
form
a

he
interesting
to
note
here
that
in
all
probability
the
word
skedaddle
about
which
there
was
some
controversy
during
the
war
came
from
the
virginia
negro
use
of
skaddle
which
is
a
corruption
of
scatter
the
matter
however
is
hardly
worth
referring

xix
the
fate
of

said
uncle
remus
as
the
little
boy
came
running
into
his
cabin
out
of
the
rain
all
over
the
floor
long
strips
of
wahoo
bark
were
spread
and
these
the
old
man
was
weaving
into
i
sit
down
uncle
remus
said
the
little
boy
well

the

kaze
i

but
i
a
gittin
too
ole
fer
ter

projickin
shuck
collars
for
a
few
minutes
the
old
man
went
on
with
his
work
but
with
a
solemn
air
altogether
unusual
once
or
twice
he
sighed
deeply
and
the
sighs
ended
in
a
prolonged
groan
that
seemed
to
the
little
boy
to
be
the
result
of
the
most
unspeakable
mental
agony
he
knew
by
experience
that
he
had
done
something
which
failed
to
meet
the
approval
of
uncle
remus
and
he
tried
to
remember
what
it
was
so
as
to
frame
an
excuse
but
his
memory
failed
him
he
could
think
of
nothing
he
had
done
calculated
to
stir
uncle
remus
grief
he
was
not
exactly
seized
with
remorse
but
he
was
very
uneasy
presently
uncle
remus
looked
at
him
in
a
sad
and
hopeless
way
and
asked
dat
long
rigmarole
you
bin
tellin
miss
sally

uncle

asked
the
little

uncle

accompanied
the
speech
of
the
bird
with
a
peculiar
whistling
sound
in
his
throat
that
was
a
marvelous
imitation
of
a
sparrow
chirp
and
the
little
boy
clapped

here
uncle
remus
paused
opened
wide
his
mouth
and
closed
it
again
in
a
way
that
told
the
whole
story
did
the
fox
eat
the
bird
all
all
up
asked
the
little
boy
jedge
come
long
nex
day
replied
uncle
remus
en
he
fine
some
fedders
en
fum
dat
word
went
roun
dat
ole
man
squinch
owl
done
kotch
nudder
watzizname
an
atlanta
friend
heard
this
story
in
florida
but
an
alligator
was
substituted
for
the
fox
and
a
little
boy
for
the
rabbit
there
is
another
version
in
which
the
impertinent
gosling
goes
to
tell
the
fox
something
her
mother
has
said
and
is
caught
and
there
may
be
other
versions
i
have
adhered
to
the
middle
georgia
version
which
is
characteristic
enough
it
may
be
well
to
state
that
there
are
different
versions
of
all
the
stories
the
shrewd
narrators
of
the
mythology
of
the
old
plantation
adapting
themselves
with
ready
tact
to
the
years
tastes
and
expectations
of
their
juvenile
audiences
xx
how
rabbit
saved
his
meat
one
time
said
uncle
remus
whetting
his
knife
slowly
and
thoughtfully
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
gazing
reflectively
in
the
fire
one
time
brer
wolf
why
uncle
remus
the
little
boy
broke
in
i
thought
you
said
the
rabbit
scalded
the
wolf
to
death
a
long
time
ago
the
old
man
was
fairly
caught
and
he
knew
it
but
this
made
little
difference
to
him
a
frown
gathered
on
his
usually
serene
brow
as
he
turned
his
gaze
upon
the
child
a
frown
in
which
both
scorn
and
indignation
were
visible
then
all
at
once
he
seemed
to
regain
control
of
himself
the
frown
was
chased
away
by
a
look
of
christian
resignation
dar
now
i
tell
you
he
exclaimed
as
if
addressing
a
witness
concealed
under
the
bed
ai

the

said
the
rabbit
poured
hot
water
on
the
wolf
and
killed
him
said
the
little
boy
the
old
man
pretended
not
to
hear
he
was
engaged
in
searching
among
some
scraps
of
leather
under
his
chair
and
kept
on
talking
to
the
imaginary
person
finally
he
found
and
drew
forth
a
nicely
plaited
with
a
red
snapper
all
waxed
and
knotted
i
wuz
fixin

twel

i
duz
the
child
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
his
lips
began
to
quiver
but
he
said
nothing
whereupon
uncle
remus
immediately
melted
i
to
goodness
he
said
reaching
out
and
taking
the
little
boy
tenderly
by
the
hand

the
little

conquered
him
and
he
had
conquered
uncle
remus
in
pretty
much
the
same
way
before
but
it
was
some
time
before
uncle
remus
would
go
on
with
the
story
he
had
to
be
coaxed
at
last
however
he
settled
himself
back
in

ez

wid
a
fresh
bug
here
the
old
man
paused
and
glanced
at
the
little
boy
but
it
was
evident
that
the
youngster
had
become
so
accustomed
to
the
marvelous
developments
of
uncle
stories
that
the
extraordinary
statement
made
no
unusual
impression
upon
him
therefore
the
old
man
began
again
and
this
time
in
a
louder
and
more
insinuating
tone

the
old
man
shifted
his
position
in
his
chair
and
allowed
his
venerable
head
to
drop
forward
until
his
whole
appearance
was
suggestive
of
the
deepest
dejection
and
this
was
intensified
by
a
groan
that
seemed
to
be
the
result
of
great
mental
agony
finally
he
spoke
but
not
as
addressing
himself

the
little
boy

the
little
boy
made
no
further
attempt
to
justify
his
conduct
he
was
a
very
wise
little
boy
and
he
knew
that
in
uncle
eyes
he
had
been
guilty
of
a
flagrant
violation
of
the
family
code
therefore
instead
of
attempting
to
justify
himself
he
pleaded
guilty
and
promised
that
he
would
never
do
so
any
more
after
this
there
was
a
long
period
of
silence
broken
only
by
the
vigorous
style
in
which
uncle
remus
puffed
away
at
his
pipe
this
was
the
invariable
result
whenever
the
old
man
had
occasion
to
reprimand
the
little
boy
and
the
occasions
were
frequent
he
would
relapse
into
a
dignified
but
stubborn
silence
presently
the
youngster
drew
forth
from
his
pocket
a
long
piece
of
candle
the
sharp
eyes
of
the
old
man
saw
it
at
once
do
you
come
a
tellin
me
dat

he
exclaimed

xxviii
the
end
of
bear
the
next
time
the
little
boy
sought
uncle
remus
out
he
found
the
old
man
unusually
cheerful
and
his
rheumatism
had
ceased
to
trouble
him
and
he
was
even
disposed
to
be
boisterous
he
was
singing
when
the
little
boy
got
near
the
cabin
and
the
child
paused
on
the
outside
to
listen
to
the
vigorous
but
mellow
voice
of
the
old
man
as
it
rose
and
fell
with
the
burden
of
the
curiously
plaintive
song
a
senseless
affair
so
far
as
the
words
were
concerned
but
sung
to
a
melody
almost
thrilling
in
its
sweetness
han
me

hey
my

down

yo
true
lover
gone
down

hey

go
down
de
road
the
quick
ear
of
uncle
remus
however
had
detected
the
presence
of
the
little
boy
and
he
allowed
his
song
to
run
into
a
recitation
of
nonsense
of
which
the
following
if
it
be
rapidly
spoken
will
give
a
faint
idea

all
this
rattled
off
at
a
rapid
rate
and
with
apparent
seriousness
was
calculated
to
puzzle
the
little
boy
and
he
slipped
into
his
accustomed
seat
with
an
expression
of
awed
bewilderment
upon
his
face

the
little
boy
made
no

he
was
in
thorough
sympathy
with
all
the
whims
and
humors
of
the
old
man
and
his
capacity
for
enjoying
them
was
large
enough
to
include
even
those
he
could
not
understand
uncle
remus
was
finishing
an
and
upon
these
occasions
it
was
his
custom
to
allow
the
child
to
hold
one
end
while
he
applied
to
the
other
these
relations
were
pretty
soon
established
to
the
mutual
satisfaction
of
the
parties
most
interested

vague
wavering
shadows

to
the
little

a
chorus
of
lost
and
forgotten
whistlers
the
sound
was
wherever
the
imagination
chose
to
locate
it
to
the
right
to
the
left
in
the
air
on
the
ground
far
away
or
near
at

but
always
dim
and
always
indistinct
something
in
uncle
remus
tone
exactly
fitted
all
these
surroundings
and
the
child
nestled
closer
to
the

the
result
of
this
was
that
uncle
remus
had
to
take
the
little
boy
by
the
hand
and
go
with
him
to
the
big
house
which
the
old
man
was
not
loath
to
do
and
when
the
child
went
to
bed
he
lay
awake
a
long
time
expecting
an
unseemly
visitation
from
some
mysterious
source
it
soothed
him
however
to
hear
the
strong
musical
voice
of
his
sable
patron
not
very
far
away
tenderly
contending
with
a
lusty
tune
and
to
this
accompaniment
the
little
boy
dropped

upon
his
next
visit
to
uncle
remus
the
little
boy
was
exceedingly
anxious
to
know
more
about
witches
but
the
old
man
prudently
refrained
from
exciting
the
youngster
imagination
any
further
in
that
direction
uncle
remus
had
a
board
across

so
fokes
call
dat
dey
tells
me
hit
may
be
wrong
maybe
right
but
dat
i
years
this
story
is
popular
on
the
coast
and
among
the
plantations
and
since
the
publication
of
some
of
the
in
the
newspapers
i
have
received
a
version
of
it
from
a
planter
in
southwest
georgia
but
it
seems
to
me
to
be
an
intruder
among
the
genuine
of
the
negroes
it
is
a
trifle
too
elaborate
nevertheless
it
is
told
upon
the
plantations
with
great
gusto
and
there
are
several
versions
in
circulation
xxxiii
why
the
negro
is
black
one
night
while
the
little
boy
was
watching
uncle
remus
twisting
and
waxing
some
he
made
what
appeared
to
him
to
be
a
very
curious
discovery
he
discovered
that
the
palms
of
the
old
man
hands
were
as
white
as
his
own
and
the
fact
was
such
a
source
of
wonder
that
he
at
last
made
it
the
subject
of
remark
the
response
of
uncle
remus
led
to
the
earnest
recital
of
a
piece
of
unwritten
history
that
must
prove
interesting
to
ethnologists
tooby
sho
de

the
little
boy
laughed
he
thought
uncle
remus
was
making
him
the
victim
of
one
of
his
jokes
but
the
youngster
was
never
more
mistaken
the
old
man
was
serious
nevertheless
he
failed
to
rebuke
the
mirth
of
the
child
appearing
to
be
altogether
engrossed
in
his
work
after
a

a
story
of
the
war
when
miss
theodosia
huntingdon
of
burlington
vermont
concluded
to
come
south
in
she
was
moved
by
three
considerations
in
the
first
place
her
brother
john
huntingdon
had
become
a
citizen
of
georgia
having
astonished
his
acquaintances
by
marrying
a
young
lady
the
male
members
of
whose
family
had
achieved
considerable
distinction
in
the
confederate
army
in
the
second
place
she
was
anxious
to
explore
a
region
which
she
almost
unconsciously
pictured
to
herself
as
remote
and
barbarous
and
in
the
third
place
her
friends
had
persuaded
her
that
to
some
extent
she
was
an
invalid
it
was
in
vain
that
she
argued
with
herself
as
to
the
propriety
of
undertaking
the
journey
alone
and
unprotected
and
she
finally
put
an
end
to
inward
and
outward
doubts
by
informing
herself
and
her
friends
including
john
huntingdon
her
brother
who
was
practicing
law
in
atlanta
that
she
had
decided
to
visit
the
south
when
therefore
on
the
of
october
the
date
is
duly
recorded
in
one
of
miss
theodosia
letters
she
alighted
from
the
cars
in
atlanta
in
the
midst
of
a
great
crowd
she
fully
expected
to
find
her
brother
waiting
to
receive
her
the
bells
of
several
locomotives
were
ringing
a
number
of
trains
were
moving
in
and
out
and
the
porters
and
were
screaming
and
bawling
to
such
an
extent
that
for
several
moments
miss
huntingdon
was
considerably
confused
so
much
so
that
she
paused
in
the
hope
that
her
brother
would
suddenly
appear
and
rescue
her
from
the
smoke
and
dust
and
din
at
that
moment
some
one
touched
her
on
the
arm
and
she
heard
a
strong
voice
exclaim
ai
dish
yer
miss
doshy
turning
miss
theodosia
saw
at
her
side
a
tall
negro
elaborating
the
incident
afterward
to
her
friends
she
was
pleased
to
say
that
the
appearance
of
the
old
man
was
somewhat
picturesque
he
stood
towering
above
her
his
hat
in
one
hand
a
in
the
other
and
an
expectant
smile
lighting
up
his
rugged
face
she
remembered
a
name
her
brother
had
often
used
in
his
letters
and
with
a
woman
tact
she
held
out
her
hand
and
said
is
this
uncle
remus
law
miss
doshy
how
you
know
de
ole
nigger
i
know
you
by
de
faver
but
how
you
know
me
and
then
without
waiting
for
a
reply
miss
sally
she
sick
in
bed
en
mars
john
he
bleedzd
ter
go
in
de
country
en
dey

wuz
you
ai
gun
up
checks
is
you
kaze
i
git
de
trunk
sont
up
by
de
waggin
the
next
moment
uncle
remus
was
elbowing
his
way
unceremoniously
through
the
crowd
and
in
a
very
short
time
seated
in
the
carriage
driven
by
the
old
man
miss
huntingdon
was
whirling
through
the
streets
of
atlanta
in
the
direction
of
her
home
she
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
study
the
old
negro
face
closely
her
natural
curiosity
considerably
sharpened
by
a
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
uncle
remus
had
played
an
important
part
in
her
brother
history
the
result
of
her
observation
must
have
been
satisfactory
for
presently
she
laughed
and
said
uncle
remus
you
have
told
me
how
you
knew
me
in
that
great
crowd
the
old
man
chuckled
and
gave
the
horses
a
gentle
rap
with
the
whip
who
me
i
know
you
by
de
faver
dat

er

down
dar
in
de
this
was
miss
theodosia
introduction
to
uncle
remus
one
sunday
afternoon
a
few
weeks
after
her
arrival
the
family
were
assembled
in
the
piazza
enjoying
the
mild
weather
huntingdon
was
reading
a
newspaper
his
wife
was
crooning
softly
as
she
rocked
the
baby
to
sleep
and
the
little
boy
was
endeavoring
to
show
his
aunt
dosia
the
outlines
of
kennesaw
mountain
through
the
purple
haze
that
hung
like
a
wonderfully
fashioned
curtain
in
the
sky
and
almost
obliterated
the
horizon
while
they
were
thus
engaged
uncle
remus
came
around
the
corner
of
the
house
talking
to
himself
dey
er
too
lazy
ter
wuk
he
was
saying
en
dey
specks
fokes
fer
ter
stan
up
en
um
i
gwine
down
ter
putmon
county
whar
mars
jeems
is
dat
i
agwine
ter
do
what
the
matter
now
uncle
remus
inquired
huntingdon
folding
up
his
newspaper
nuthin
mars
john
deze
yer
sunshine
niggers
dey
begs
my
terbacker
en
borrys

en
hit
done
come
ter
dat
pass
dat
i
gotter
pack
up
en
go
agwine
down
ter
putmon
dat
uncle
remus
was
accustomed
to
make
this
threat
several
times
a
day
but
upon
this
occasion
it
seemed
to
remind
huntingdon
of
something
very
well
he
said
i
come
around
and
help
you
pack
up
but
before
you
go
i
want
you
to
tell
sister
here
how
you
went
to
war
and
fought
for
the
remus
was
a
famous
warrior
he
continued
turning
to
miss
theodosia
he
volunteered
for
one
day
and
commanded
an
army
of
one
you
know
the
story
but
you
have
never
heard
remus
version
uncle
remus
shuffled
around
in
an
awkward
embarrassed
way
scratched
his
head
and
looked
uncomfortable
miss
doshy
ai
got
no
time
fer
ter
set
dar
an
year
de
ole
nigger
run
on
oh
yes
i
have
uncle
remus
exclaimed
the
young
lady
plenty
of
time
the
upshot
of
it
was
that
after
many
ridiculous
protests
uncle
remus
sat
down
on
the
steps
and
proceeded
to
tell
his
story
of
the
war
miss
theodosia
listened
with
great
interest
but
throughout
it
all
she
observed
and
she
was
painfully
conscious
of
the
fact
as
she
afterward
admitted
that
uncle
remus
spoke
from
the
standpoint
of
a
southerner
and
with
the
air
of
one
who
expected
his
hearers
to
thoroughly
sympathize
with
him
said
uncle
remus
addressing
himself
to
miss
theodosia

of
the
cotton
states
and
those
on
the
seaboard
a
difference
that
extends
to
habits
and
opinions
as
well
as
to
dialect
has
given
rise
to
certain
ineradicable
prejudices
which
are
quick
to
display
themselves
whenever
an
opportunity
offers
these
prejudices
were
forcibly
as
well
as
ludicrously
illustrated
in
atlanta
recently
a
gentleman
from
savannah
had
been
spending
the
summer
in
the
mountains
of
north
georgia
and
found
it
convenient
to
take
along
a
this
servant
was
a
very
fine
specimen
of
the
average
coast
negro
sleek
and
consequential
disposed
to
regard
with
undisguised
contempt
everything
and
everybody
not
indigenous
to
the
region
and
he
paraded
around
the
streets
with
quite
a
curious
and
critical
air
espying
uncle
remus
languidly
sunning
himself
on
a
corner

uncle

with
the
toothache
when
uncle

put
in
an
appearance
one
morning
recently
his
friends
knew
he
had
been
in
trouble
he
had
a
red
cotton
handkerchief
tied
under
his
chin
and
the
genial
humor
that
usually
makes
his
aged
face
its
had
given
way
to
an
expression
of
grim
melancholy
the
young
men
about
the
office
were
inclined
to
chaff
him
but
his
look
of
sullen
resignation
remained
unchanged
what
revival
did
you
attend
last
night
inquired
one
what
was
the
color
of
the
mule
that
did
the
hammering
asked
another
i
always
told
the
old
man
that
a
suburban
chicken
coop
would
fall
on
him
remarked
some
one
a
strange
pig
has
been
squealing
in
his
ear
suggested
some
one
else
but
uncle
remus
remained
impassive
he
seemed
to
have
lost
all
interest
in
what
was
going
on
around
him
and
he
sighed
heavily
as
he
seated
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
in
front
of
the
office
finally
some
one
asked
in
a
sympathetic
tone
what
is
the
matter

one
morning
recently
the
first
sight
that
caught
his
eye
was
an
old
negro
man
a
woman
and
two
children
sitting
in
the
shade
near
the
door
of
the
one
of
the
children
was
very
young
and
the
quartet
was
altogether
ragged
and
the
sympathies
of
uncle
remus
were
immediately
aroused
he
approached
the
group
by
forced
marches
and
finally
unburdened
his
curiosity
whar

you
unter
pard
the
old
negro
who
seemed
to
be
rather
suspicious
looked
at
uncle
remus
coolly
and
appeared
to
be
considering
whether
he
should
make
any
reply
finally
however
he
stretched
himself
and

xxi
the
fourth
of
july
uncle
remus
made
his
appearance
recently
with
his
right
arm
in
a
sling
and
his
head
bandaged
to
that
extent
that
it
looked
like
the
stick
made
to
accompany
the
centennial
the
old
man
evidently
expected
an
attack
all
around
for
he
was
unusually
quiet
and
fumbled
in
his
pockets
in
an
embarrassed
manner
he
was
not
mistaken
the
agricultural
editor
was
the
first
to
open
fire
well
you
old
villain
what
have
you
been
up
to
now
it
is
really
singular
remarked
a
commencement
orator
that
not
even
an
ordinary
holiday
a
holiday
it
seems
to
me
that
ought
to
arouse
all
the
latent
instincts
of
patriotism
in
the
bosom
of
american
citizens
can
occur
without
embroiling
some
of
our
most
valuable
citizens
it
is
really
singular
to
me
that
such
a
day
should
be
devoted
by
a
certain
class
of
our
population
to
broils
and
fisticuffs
this
final
moral
sentiment
which
was
altogether
an
impromptu
utterance
and
which
was
delivered
with
the
air
of
one
who
addresses
a
vast
but
invisible
audience
of
young
ladies
in
white
dresses
and
blue
sashes
seemed
to
add
to
the
embarrassment
of
uncle
remus
and
at
the
same
time
to
make
an
explanation
necessary
dey
ai
none
er
you
young
men
never
had
no
fer
