a

no
accurate

ever

fact
which
i
think
disposes
of

claim

science
astronomers
quail
at
the
problem
and
throw
up
their
hands
in

before
the
problem
any

moment
in

is
a
problem
of
at
least
two
billion
bodies
attempts
at
orderly
abstraction
of
manipulable
symbols
from
the
realities
of
history
seem
to
me
doomed
from
the
start
i
can
juggle
mean
curves
and
patent
applications
but
i
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
fit
the
recurring
facial
carbuncles
of
karl
marx
into
my
manipulations
not
even
though
we
know

the
fact
that

to
take
only
these
eleven
were
anything
but
what
they
were
yet
that
is
the
assumption
behind
theories
of
history
which
exclude
the
carbuncles
of
marx
from
their
referents
that
is
to
say
every
theory
of
history
with
which
i
am
familiar
am
i
then
saying
that
history
past
and
future
is
unknowable
that
we
must
blunder
ahead
in
the
dark
without
planning
because
no
plan
can
possibly
be
accurate
in
prediction
and
useful
in
application

am
not
i
am
expressing
my
distaste
for
holders
of
extreme
positions
for
possessors
of
eternal
truths
for
keepers
of
the
flame
keepers
of
the
flame
have
no
trouble
with
the
questions
of
ends
and
means
which
plague
the
rest
of
us
they
are
quite
certain
that
their
ends
are
good
and
that
therefore
choice
of
means
is
a
trivial
matter
the
rest
of
us
far
from
certain
that
we
have
a
general
solution
of
the
body
problem
that
is
history
are
much
more
likely
to
ponder
on
our
means

and
i
charles
orsino
was
learning
the
business
from
the
ground
up
even
though
up
would
never
be
very
high
he
had
in
his
veins
only
a
drop
or
two
of
falcaro
blood
enough
so
that
room
had
to
be
made
for
him
not
enough
for
it
to
be
a
great
dearth
of
room
counting
heavily
on
the
good
will
of
taylor
who
had
taken
a
fancy
to
him
when
he
lost
his
parents
in
the
brookhaven
reactor
explosion
of
he
might
rise
to
a
rather
responsible
position
in
alky
horsewire
callgirl
recruitment
and
retirement
or
whatever
line
he
showed
an
aptitude
for
but
at
one
spring
day
he
was
merely
serving
a
tour
of
duty
as
bagman
attached
to
the
new
york
police
precinct
a
junior
member
of
the
syndic
customarily
handled
that
job
you
could
trust
the
cops
not
to
squeeze
their
customers
and
pocket
the
difference
he
walked
absently
through
the
routine
of
the
shakedown
his
mind
was
on
his
practice
session
of
polo
in
which
he
had
almost
disgraced
himself
good
afternoon
orsino
a
pleasure
to
see
you
again
would
you
like
a
cold
glass
of
beer
while
i
get
the
loot
no
but
thanks
very
much
lefko
i
in
training
you
know
wish
i
could
take
you
up
on
it
seven
phones
is
it
at
ten
dollars
a
phone
that
right
orsino
and
i
be
with
you
as
soon
as
i
lay
off
the
seventh
at
hialeah
all
the
ladies
went
for
a
plater
named
hearthmouse
because
they
thought
the
name
was
cute
and
left
me
with
a
dutch
book
i
wo
be
a
minute
lefko
scuttled
to
a
phone
and
dickered
with
another
bookie
somewhere
while
charles
absently
studied
the
crowd
of
chattering
laughing
horseplayers
mister
orsino
did
you
come
out
to
make
a
monkey
of
yourself
and
waste
my
time
confound
it
sir
you
have
just
fifty
round
to
a
chukker
and
you
must
make
them
count
he
grinned
unhappily
old
gilby
the
pro
could
be
abrasive
when
a
play
disfigured
the
game
he
loved
charles
had
been
sure
benny
grashkin
jeep
would
conk
out
in
a
minute
it
had
been
sputtering
badly
enough
and
that
he
would
have
had
a
scoring
shot
while
benny
changed
mounts
but
gilby
blew
the
whistle
and
was
interested
in
your
logic
confound
it
sir
when
will
you
young
rufflers
learn
that
you
must
crawl
before
you
walk
now
let
me
see
a
team
rush
for
the
goal
and
i
mean
mr
orsino
we
are
orsino
and
just
in
time
there
goes
the
seventh
charles
shook
hands
and
left
amid
screams
of
hearthmouse
hearthmouse
from
the
lady
bettors
watching
the
screen
high
up
in
the
syndic
building
taylor
uncle
frank
to
charles
was
giving
a
terrific
to
a
big
stooped
old
man
thornberry
president
of
the
chase
national
bank
had
pulled
a
butch
and
taylor
was
blazing
mad
about
it
he
snarled
one
more
like
this
thornberry
and
you
are
out
on
your
padded
can
when
a
respectable
member
of
the
syndic
chooses
to
come
to
you
for
a
line
of
credit
you
will
in
the
future
give
it
without
any
quibbling
about
security
you
bankers
seem
to
think
this
is
the
middle
ages
and
that
your
bits
of
paper
still
have
their
old
black
magic
disabuse
yourself
of
the
notion
nobody
except
you
believes
in
it
the
inexorable
laws
of
economics
are
as
dead
as
dagon
and
ishtar
and
for
the
same
reason
no
more
worshippers
you
bankers
ca
shove
anybody
around
any
more
you
just
a
convenience
like
the
banker
in
a
card
game
what
real
now
is
the
syndic
what
real
about
the
syndic
is
its
own
morale
and
the
public
faith
in
it
is
that
thornberry
brokenly
mumbled
something
about
supply
and
demand
taylor
sneered
supply
and
demand
urim
and
thummim
show
me
a
supply
thornberry
show
me
a
oh
hell
i
have
time
to
waste
you
remember
what
i
told
you
and
do
argue
unlimited
credit
to
syndic
members
if
they
overdo
it
rectify
the
situation
now
get
out
and
thornberry
did
with
senile
tears
in
his
eyes
at
mother
maginnis
ould
sod
pub
mother
maginnis
pulled
a
long
face
when
charles
orsino
came
in
it
always
a
pleasure
to
see
you
orsino
but
i
afraid
this
week
it
be
no
pleasure
for
you
to
see
me
she
was
always
roundabout
why
what
do
you
mean
i
always
happy
to
say
hello
to
a
customer
it
the
business
orsino
it
the
business
you
pardon
me
if
i
say
that
i
ca
see
how
to
spare
dollars
from
the
till
not
if
my
life
depended
on
it
i
can
go
to
fifteen
but
so
help
me
charles
looked
grave
graver
than
he
felt
it
happened
every
day
you
realize
maginnis
that
you
letting
the
syndic
down
what
would
the
people
in
syndic
territory
do
for
protection
if
everybody
took
your
attitude
she
looked
sly
i
was
thinking
orsino
that
a
young
man
like
you
must
have
a
way
with
the
girls
by
a
mighty
unsubtle
maneuver
maginnis
daughter
emerged
from
the
back
room
at
that
point
and
began
demurely
mopping
the
bar
and
she
continued
sure
any
young
lady
would
consider
it
an
honor
to
spend
the
evening
with
a
young
gentleman
from
the
syndic
perhaps
charles
said
rapidly
thinking
it
over
he
would
infinitely
rather
spend
the
evening
with
a
girl
than
at
a
shakespeare
revival
as
he
had
planned
but
there
were
drawbacks
in
the
first
place
it
would
be
bribery
in
the
second
place
he
might
fall
for
the
girl
and
wake
up
with
maginnis
for
his
a
fate
too
nauseating
to
contemplate
for
more
than
a
moment
in
the
third
place
he
had
already
bought
the
tickets
for
himself
and
bodyguard
about
the
shakedown
he
said
decisively
call
it
fifteen
this
week
if
you
still
doing
badly
next
week
i
have
to
ask
for
a
look
at
your
books
to
see
whether
a
regular
reduction
is
in
order
she
got
the
hint
and
colored
putting
down
fifteen
dollars
she
said
sure
that
wo
be
necessary
i
expecting
business
to
take
a
turn
for
the
better
it
sure
to
pick
up
good
then
to
show
there
were
no
hard
feelings
he
stayed
for
a
moment
to
ask
how
are
your
husbands
alfie
on
the
road
this
week
and
dinnie
got
the
rheumatism
again
but
he
can
tend
bar
late
when
it
slow
tell
him
to
drop
around
to
the
medical
center
and
mention
my
name
maginnis
maybe
they
can
do
something
for
him
she
glowed
with
thanks
and
he
left
it
was
pleasant
to
be
able
to
do
things
for
nice
people
it
was
pleasant
to
stroll
along
the
sunny
street
acknowledging
tipped
hats
and
friendly
words
that
team
rush
for
the
goal
had
been
a
sorry
mess
but
not
his
fault
quite
vladek
had
loosed
a
premature
burst
from
his
fifty
caliber
at
the
ball
and
sent
it
hurling
off
to
the
right
they
had
braked
and
backed
with
much
grinding
of
gears
to
form
v
again
behind
it
when
gilby
blew
the
whistle
again
a
nervous
youngster
in
the
national
press
service
new
york
drop
was
facing
his
first
crisis
on
the
job
trouble
lights
had
flashed
simultaneously
on
the
kansas
york
york
and
york
trunks
he
stood
paralyzed
his
supervisor
took
it
in
in
a
flash
and
banged
open
the
circuit
to
service
to
the
genial
face
that
appeared
on
the
screen
he
snapped
trace
hialeah
boston
and
kansas
city
in
that
order
micky
micky
said
okay
pal
and
vanished
the
supervisor
turned
to
the
youngster
did
know
what
to
do
he
asked
genially
do
let
it
worry
you
next
time
you
know
you
noticed
the
order
of
priority
yes
the
boy
gulped
it
was
an
accident
that
i
gave
it
to
him
that
way
first
hialeah
because
it
was
the
most
important
we
get
the
bulk
of
our
revenue
from
serving
the
horse
rooms
in
fact
i
understand
we
started
as
a
horse
wire
exclusively
naturally
the
customers
pay
for
it
in
the
long
run
but
they
pay
without
pain
nobody
forcing
them
to
improve
the
breed
right
second
york
trunk
that
while
the
fair
grounds
is
running
up
there
we
do
make
any
profit
on
service
the
rates
are
too
low
but
we
owe
it
to
the
public
that
supports
us
third
kansas
york
that
common
carrier
too
but
with
one
terminal
in
mob
territory
no
reason
why
we
should
knock
ourselves
out
for
regan
and
his
boys
but
after
the
other
two
are
traced
and
closed
we
get
around
to
them
think
you
got
it
straight
now
yes
the
youngster
said
good
just
take
it
easy
the
supervisor
moved
away
to
do
a
job
of
billing
that
did
need
immediate
doing
he
wanted
to
avoid
the
very
appearance
of
nagging
the
boy
he
wondered
too
if
he
really
put
it
over
and
decided
he
had
who
could
after
all
it
took
years
on
the
wires
to
get
the
feel
slowly
your
motivation
changed
you
started
by
wanting
to
make
a
place
for
yourself
and
earn
some
dough
after
years
you
realized
not
with
a
blinding
flash
but
gradually
that
you
were
working
for
quite
another
reason
nice
gang
here
that
treats
you
right
do
let
the
syndic
down
the
customers
pay
for
their
fun
and
by
god
you
see
that
they
get
it
or
bust
a
gut
trying
on
his
way
to
the
precinct
station
house
the
ears
of
charles
orsino
burned
as
he
thought
of
the
withering
lecture
that
had
followed
the
blast
on
gilby
whistle
orsino
is
it
or
is
it
not
your
responsibility
as
team
captain
to
demand
that
a
dangerous
ball
be
taken
out
of
play
and
did
or
did
not
that
last
burst
from
mister
vladek
beat
the
ball
out
of
round
thus
giving
rise
to
a
distinct
possibility
of
dangerous
ricochets
the
old
man
was
right
of
course
but
it
had
been
a
pocked
and
battered
practice
ball
to
start
with
in
practice
sessions
you
could
afford
to
be
fussy
not
with
regulation
inch
armor
steel
balls
selling
for
thirty
dollars
each
at
the
pro
shop
he
walked
between
the
two
green
lamps
of
the
precinct
station
and
dumped
his
bag
on
the
sergeant
desk
immediately
the
sergeant
started
a
tale
of
woe
orsino
i
do
like
to
bother
you
with
the
men
personal
troubles
but
i
wonder
if
you
could
come
through
with
a
hundred
dollar
present
for
a
very
deserving
young
fellow
here
it
patrolman
gibney
seven
years
in
the
old
and
not
a
black
mark
against
him
one
citation
for
shooting
it
out
with
a
burglar
and
another
for
nabbing
a
crook
at
lefko
horse
room
gibney
been
married
for
five
years
and
has
two
of
the
cutest
kids
you
ever
saw
and
you
know
that
takes
money
now
he
wants
to
get
married
again
he
crazy
in
love
with
the
girl
and
his
first
wife
do
mind
she
says
she
can
use
a
helping
hand
around
the
house
and
he
wants
to
do
it
right
with
a
big
wedding
if
he
can
do
it
on
a
hundred
he
welcome
to
it
charles
said
grinning
give
him
my
best
wishes
he
divided
the
pile
of
bills
into
two
orderly
stacks
transferred
a
hundred
dollars
to
one
and
pocketed
the
other
he
dropped
it
off
at
the
syndic
building
had
an
uninteresting
dinner
in
one
of
its
cafeterias
and
went
to
his
furnished
room
downtown
he
read
a
chapter
in
taylor
uncle
frank
latest
book
symbolism
and
could
understand
a
word
he
read
bathed
and
got
out
his
evening
clothes
a
thin
and
attractive
girl
entered
a
room
in
the
syndic
building
arguing
bitterly
with
a
old
man
my
dear
ancestor
she
began
with
exaggerated
patience
it
lee
do
call
me
an
ancestor
makes
me
feel
as
if
i
was
dead
already
you
might
as
well
be
for
all
the
sense
you
talking
all
right
lee
he
looked
wounded
and
brave
oh
i
did
mean
to
hurt
your
feelings
edward
she
studied
his
face
with
eyes
and
her
tone
changed
listen
you
old
devil
you
not
fooling
me
for
a
minute
i
could
hurt
your
feelings
with
the
blunt
edge
of
an
axe
you
not
talking
me
into
anything
just
be
sending
somebody
to
his
death
besides
they
were
both
accidents
she
turned
and
began
to
fiddle
with
a
screen
whose
focus
was
a
large
and
complicated
chair
three
synchronized
projectors
bore
on
the
screen
the
old
man
said
very
softly
and
what
if
they
were
tom
mcgurn
and
bob
were
good
men
none
better
if
the
damn
government
knocking
us
off
one
by
one
something
ought
to
be
done
and
you
seem
to
be
the
only
person
in
a
position
to
do
it
start
a
war
she
said
bitterly
sweep
them
from
the
seas
was
dick
reiner
chanting
that
when
i
was
in
diapers
yes
the
old
man
brooded
and
he
still
chanting
it
now
that
in
whatever
young
ladies
wear
nowadays
promise
me
something
lee
if
there
another
try
will
you
help
us
out
i
am
so
sure
there
wo
be
she
said
that
i
promise
and
god
help
you
edward
if
you
try
to
fake
one
i
told
you
before
and
i
tell
you
now
that
it
almost
certain
death
charles
orsino
studied
himself
in
a
mirror
the
evening
suit
was
new
he
wished
the
gunbelt
was
the
holster
rode
awkwardly
on
his
hip
he
had
got
a
new
outfit
since
his
eighteenth
birthday
and
his
chest
had
filled
out
to
the
last
hole
of
the
buckle
since
then
well
it
would
have
to
wait
the
evening
would
cost
him
enough
as
it
was
five
bodyguards
he
winced
at
the
thought
but
you
had
to
be
seen
at
these
things
and
you
had
to
do
it
right
or
it
did
count
he
fell
into
a
brief
reverie
of
meeting
a
beautiful
beautiful
girl
at
the
theater
a
girl
who
would
think
he
was
interesting
and
handsome
and
a
wonderful
polo
player
a
girl
who
would
happily
turn
out
to
be
in
the
direct
falcaro
line
with
all
sorts
of
powerful
relations
to
speak
up
for
him
someone
said
on
his
room
annunciator
the
limousine
is
here
orsino
i
halloran
your
chief
bodyguard
very
well
halloran
he
said
casually
just
as
he
practiced
it
in
the
bathroom
that
morning
and
rode
down
the
limousine
was
a
beauty
and
the
guards
were
faultlessly
turned
out
one
was
democratic
with
one
chief
guard
and
a
little
less
so
with
the
others
as
halloran
drove
charles
chatted
with
him
about
the
play
which
was
julius
caesar
in
modern
dress
halloran
said
he
heard
it
was
very
good
their
arrival
in
the
lobby
of
the
costello
created
no
sensation
five
bodyguards
was
a
lot
of
bodyguards
even
though
there
seemed
to
be
no
other
syndic
people
there
so
much
for
the
beautiful
falcaro
girl
charles
chatted
with
a
television
director
he
knew
slightly
the
director
explained
to
him
that
the
theater
was
sick
very
sick
that
harry
tremaine
he
played
brutus
made
a
magnificent
stage
picture
but
could
read
lines
by
then
halloran
was
whispering
in
his
ear
that
it
was
time
to
take
their
seats
halloran
was
sweating
like
a
pig
and
charles
did
get
around
to
asking
him
why
charles
took
an
aisle
seat
halloran
was
across
the
aisle
and
the
others
sat
to
his
side
front
and
rear
the
curtain
rose
on
new
york
a
street
the
first
scene
a
timekiller
designed
to
let
fidgeters
subside
and
coughers
finish
their
coughing
was
a
projection
of
times
square
with
a
stylized
suggestion
of
a
public
relations
consultant
office
down
in
one
on
the
apron
when
caesar
entered
orsino
started
and
there
was
a
gratified
murmur
around
the
auditorium
he
was
made
up
as
french
letour
one
of
the
mobsters
from
the
old
days
technically
a
hero
but
one
who
had
sailed
mighty
close
to
the
wind
this
promised
to
be
interesting
peace
ho
caesar
speaks
and
so
to
the
apron
where
the
soothsayer
public
relations
consultant
delivered
the
warning
contemptuously
ignored
by
and
the
spotlight
shifted
to
cassius
and
brutus
for
their
long
foreboding
dialogue
brutus
back
was
to
the
audience
when
it
started
he
gradually
turned
what
means
this
shouting
i
do
fear
the
people
will
choose
caesar
for
their
king
and
you
saw
that
brutus
was
falcaro
old
amadeo
falcaro
himself
with
the
beard
and
hawk
nose
and
eyebrows
well
let
see
now
it
must
be
some
kind
of
tortured
analogy
with
the
treaty
of
las
vegas
when
letour
made
a
strong
bid
to
unite
mob
and
syndic
and
falcaro
had
fought
against
anything
but
a
strictly
military
alliance
charles
felt
kind
of
sore
about
falcaro
not
getting
the
title
role
but
he
had
to
admit
that
tremaine
played
falcaro
as
the
gutsy
magnifico
he
had
been
when
caesar
the
contrast
became
clear
was
a
fidgety
man
the
rest
of
the
conspirators
brought
on
through
act
one
turned
out
to
be
good
fellows
all
fresh
and
hearty
charles
guessed
everything
was
all
right
and
he
wished
he
could
grab
a
nap
but
cassius
was
saying
him
and
his
worth
and
our
great
need
of
him
all
very
loyal
charles
thought
smothering
a
yawn
a
life
for
the
syndic
and
all
that
but
a
version
polite
and
dignified
like
a
pavanne
at
roseland
sometimes
after
say
a
near
miss
on
the
polo
field
he
would
wonder
how
polite
and
dignified
the
great
old
days
actually
had
been
amadeo
falcaro
third
year
purge
must
have
been
an
affair
of
blood
and
guts
two
thousand
shot
in
three
days
the
history
books
said
adding
hastily
that
the
purged
were
unreconstructed
unreconstructable
thugs
whose
usefulness
was
past
who
could
realize
that
the
job
ahead
was
construction
and
organization
and
halloran
was
touching
charles
on
the
shoulder
intermission
in
a
second
sir
they
marched
up
the
aisle
as
the
curtain
fell
to
applause
and
the
rest
of
the
audience
began
to
rise
then
the
impossible
happened
halloran
had
gone
first
charles
was
behind
him
with
the
four
other
guards
hemming
him
in
as
halloran
reached
the
door
to
the
lobby
at
the
top
of
the
aisle
he
turned
to
face
charles
and
performed
an
inexplicable
pantomime
it
was
quite
one
second
before
charles
realized
that
halloran
was
tugging
at
his
gun
stuck
in
the
holster
the
guard
to
the
left
of
charles
softly
said
jesus
and
threw
himself
at
halloran
as
the
chief
guard
gun
came
loose
there
was
a
caliber
roar
muffled
there
was
another
that
crashed
unmuffled
a
yard
from
charles
right
ear
the
two
figures
at
the
head
of
the
aisle
collapsed
limply
and
the
audience
began
to
shriek
somebody
with
a
very
loud
voice
roared
keep
calm
it
all
part
of
the
play
do
get
panicky
part
of
the
play
the
man
who
was
roaring
moved
up
to
the
aisle
door
fell
silent
saw
and
smelled
the
blood
and
fainted
a
woman
began
to
pound
the
guard
on
charles
right
with
her
fists
yelling
what
did
you
do
to
my
husband
you
shot
my
husband
she
meant
the
man
who
had
fainted
charles
peeled
her
off
the
bodyguard
somehow
they
got
into
the
lobby
followed
by
most
of
the
audience
the
three
bodyguards
held
them
at
bay
charles
found
he
was
deaf
in
his
right
ear
and
supposed
it
was
temporary
least
of
his
worries
halloran
had
taken
a
shot
at
him
the
guard
named
weltfisch
had
intercepted
it
the
guard
named
donnel
had
shot
halloran
down
he
said
to
donnel
you
know
halloran
long
donnel
not
taking
his
eyes
from
the
crowd
said
couple
of
years
sir
he
was
just
a
guy
in
the
bodyguard
pool
get
me
out
of
here
orsino
said
to
the
syndic
building
in
the
big
black
car
he
could
almost
forget
the
horror
he
could
hope
that
time
would
erase
it
completely
it
was
like
polo
that
shot
had
been
the
limousine
purred
to
a
halt
before
the
titanic
bulk
of
the
syndic
building
was
checked
and
rolled
on
into
the
unrestricted
entrance
an
elevator
silently
lifted
the
car
and
passengers
past
floors
devoted
to
alcohol
clerical
alcohol
research
and
testing
transport
collections
audit
and
control
cleaning
and
dying
female
recruitment
and
retirement
up
up
up
past
sections
and
charles
had
never
entered
syndic
member
though
he
was
to
an
automatic
stop
at
a
floor
whose
indicator
said
and
public
it
was
only
taylor
would
be
in
and
working
charles
said
wait
here
boys
and
muttered
the
code
phrase
to
the
door
it
sprang
open
taylor
was
dictating
fashion
to
a
mike
he
looked
his
face
turned
up
with
a
frown
as
charles
entered
and
then
the
frown
became
a
beam
of
pleasure
charles
my
boy
sit
down
he
snapped
off
the
machine
uncle
charles
began
it
was
so
kind
of
you
to
drop
in
i
thought
you
be
at
the
theater
i
was
uncle
but
i
working
on
a
revision
for
the
next
edition
of
symbolism
and
you
never
guess
who
inspired
it
i
sure
i
would
uncle
uncle
old
thornberry
president
of
the
chase
national
he
had
the
infernal
gall
to
refuse
a
line
of
credit
to
young
mcgurn
you
believe
it
but
people
used
to
them
to
take
over
their
property
tie
up
their
incomes
virtually
enslave
them
people
it
the
same
way
they
demanded
inexpensive
liquor
tobacco
and
consumer
goods
clean
women
and
a
chance
to
win
a
fortune
and
our
ancestors
obliged
them
our
ancestors
were
sneered
at
in
their
day
you
know
they
were
called
criminals
when
they
distributed
goods
and
services
at
a
price
people
could
afford
to
pay
uncle
hush
boy
i
know
what
you
going
to
say
you
ca
fool
the
people
forever
when
they
had
enough
hounding
and
restriction
they
rose
in
their
might
the
people
demanded
freedom
of
choice
falcaro
and
the
rest
rose
to
lead
them
in
the
syndic
and
the
mob
and
they
drove
the
government
into
the
sea
uncle
frank
from
which
it
still
occasionally
ventures
to
annoy
our
coastal
cities
taylor
commented
he
warmed
to
his
subject
you
should
have
seen
the
old
boy
blubber
the
last
of
the
bankers
and
they
deserved
everything
they
got
they
brought
it
on
themselves
they
had
what
they
called
and
it
worked
for
awhile
until
they
got
to
tinkering
with
it
they
demanded
things
called
protective
tariffs
tax
remissions
subsidies
regulation
regulation
regulation
always
of
the
other
fellow
but
there
were
enough
bankers
on
all
sides
for
everybody
to
be
somebody
else
other
fellow
coercion
snowballed
and
the
government
lost
public
acceptance
they
had
a
thing
called
the
public
debt
which
i
ca
begin
to
explain
to
you
except
to
say
that
it
was
something
written
on
paper
and
that
it
raised
the
cost
of
everything
tremendously
well
believe
me
or
not
they
just
throw
away
the
piece
of
paper
or
scratch
out
the
writing
on
it
they
let
it
ride
until
ordinary
people
could
afford
the
pleasant
things
in
life

a
cautious
periscope
broke

water
off

georgia
at
the
other
end
of
the
periscope
were
captain
van
dellen
of
the
north
american
navy
lean
as
a
hound
and
fat
little
commander
grinnel
you
might
take
her
in
a
little
closer
van
said
grinnel
mildly
the
exercise
wo
do
you
any
lasting
damage
van
dellen
said
grinnel
was
very
very
near
to
a
couple
of
admirals
and
normally
van
dellen
gave
him
the
treatment
in
spite
of
ranking
him
but
this
was
ship
and
no
cloak
and
dagger
artist
from
an
desk
was
telling
him
how
to
con
it
grinnel
smiled
genially
at
the
little
joke
i
could
call
it
a
disguise
he
said
patting
his
paunch
but
you
know
me
too
well
you
have
no
trouble
with
a
sea
like
this
van
dellen
said
strictly
business
he
tried
to
think
of
some
appropriate
phrase
to
recognize
the
danger
grinnel
was
plunging
into
with
no
resources
except
quick
wits
a
trick
ring
and
a
pair
of
guns
but
all
that
bubbled
up
to
the
top
of
his
head
was
thank
god
i
getting
rid
of
this
bastardly
little
sociocrat
he
kill
me
some
day
if
he
gets
a
clean
shot
and
the
chance
of
detection
is
zero
thank
god
i
a
constitutionist
we
do
go
in
for
things
like
that
or
do
we
nobody
ever
tells
me
anything
a
hack
of
a
pigboat
driver
and
this
little
bastard
going
to
be
an
admiral
some
day
but
that
boy
of
mine
be
an
admiral
he
brainy
like
his
mother
grinnel
smiled
and
said
well
this
would
be
it
would
it
eh
van
dellen
asked
oh
i
see
what
you
mean
chuck
he
called
a
sailor
break
out
the
commander
capsules
pass
the
word
to
stand
by
for
ejection
the
commander
was
fitted
puffing
into
the
capsule
he
growled
at
the
storekeeper
you
sure
this
was
just
unsealed
it
feels
sticky
already
a
brash
jayee
said
i
saw
it
unsealed
myself
three
minutes
ago
commander
it
get
stickier
if
we
spend
any
more
time
talking
you
have
he
glanced
at
his
chronometer
seventeen
minutes
now
let
me
snap
you
in
the
commander
huddled
down
after
a
searching
glance
at
the
jayee
face
which
photographed
it
forever
in
his
memory
the
top
snapped
down
some
day
some
happy
day
that
squirt
would
very
much
regret
telling
him
off
he
gave
an
okay
sign
to
van
dellen
who
waved
back
meagerly
and
managed
a
smile
three
crewmen
fitted
the
capsule
into
its
lock
foomf
it
was
through
the
hatch
and
bobbing
on
the
surface
its
color
matched
the
water
automatically
grinnel
waggled
the
lever
that
aimed
it
inshore
and
began
to
turn
the
propellor
crank
he
turned
fast
the
capsule
rudders
crank
flywheel
shaft
and
all
would
dissolve
in
approximately
fifteen
minutes
it
was
his
job
to
be
ashore
when
that
happened
and
ashore
he
be
practically
a
free
agent
with
the
loosest
sort
of
roving
commission

his

became

out
father
ambrosius
gnawed
at
a
bit
of
salt
herring
wiped
his
hands
dug
through
the
litter
in
his
chest
and
found
a
goose
quill
and
a
page
of
parchment
he
scrubbed
vigorously
with
a
sponge
at
the
writing
on
the
parchment
and
was
pleased
to
see
that
it
came
off
nicely
leaving
him
a
clean
surface
to
scribble
his
sermon
notes
on
he
cut
the
quill
and
slit
it
while
waiting
for
the
parchment
to
dry
wondering
idly
what
he
had
erased
it
happened
to
be
the
last
surviving
copy
of
tacitus
vii
to
work
then
the
sermon
was
to
be
preached
on
sexagesima
sunday
a
prelude
to
the
solemn
season
of
lent
father
ambrosius
mind
wandered
in
search
of
a
text

delinquent

now
and
saeculae
unless
sir
baldwin
paid
up
his
delinquent
pew
rent
at
the
moment
sir
baldwin
came
swaggering
into
the
cell
father
ambrosius
rose
courteously
and
said
with
some
insincerity
eh
asked
sir
baldwin
his
silly
blue
eyes
popping
as
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
oh

meant
me
padre

a
bit
of
good
to
chatter
at
me

latin

enough
for
me
what

huntin
stag
padre
and
i
lost
him
after

what
i
want
to
know
is
who
the
right
saint
chap
to
ask
for
help
in
a
pickle
like
that
i
mean
to
say
i
wanted
to
show
the
chaps
some
good
sport
and
we
started
this
beast
and
he
got
clean
away
do
misunderstand
me
padre
they
were
good
chaps
and
they
did
rot
me
about
it
but
that
kind
of
talk
gets
about
and
does
do
one
a
bit
of
good
what
so
you
tell
me
like
a
good
fellow
who
the
right
saint
chap
to
put
the
matter
in
the
best
light
for
me
father
ambrosius
repressed
an
urge
to
grind
his
teeth
took
thought
and
said
hubert
i
believe
is
interested
in
the
stag
hunt
padre
hubert
it
is
hubert
hubert
i
sha
forget
it
because
i
a
cousin
named
hubert
have
seen
him
for
years
poor
old
chap
he
had
the
fistula
lived
on
slops
and
could
sit
his
horse
for
a
day
huntin
poor
old
chap
well
i
off
no
there
another
thing
i
wanted
suppose
this
sunday
you
preach
a
howlin
strong
sermon
against
usury
what
that
chap
in
the
village
the
goldsmith
fellow
has
the
infernal
gall
to
tell
me
i
got
to
give
him
fallowfield
forty
acres
and
he
has
the
infernal
gall
to
tell
me
they
are
mine
any
more
be
a
good
chap
padre
and
sort
of
glare
at
him
from
the
pulpit
a
few
times
to
show
him
who
you
mean
what
usury
a
sin
father
ambrosius
said
cautiously
but
how
does
fallowfield
enter
into
it
sir
baldwin
twiddled
the
drooping
ends
of
his
limp
blond
mustache
with
a
trace
of
embarrassment
fact
is
i
told
the
chap
when
i
borrowed
the
twenty
marks
that
fallowfield
would
stand
as
security
i
ask
you
padre
is
it
my
fault
that
my
tenants
are
a
pack
of
lazy
thieving
saxon
swine
and
i
could
raise
the
money
the
parish
priest
bristled
unnoticeably
he
was
pure
saxon
himself
i
shall
do
what
i
can
he
said
and
sir
baldwin
before
you
go
the
young
man
stopped
in
the
doorway
and
turned
before
you
go
may
i
ask
when
we
see
your
pew
rent
to
say
nothing
of
the
tithe
sir
baldwin
dismissed
it
with
an
airish
wave
of
the
hand
i
thought
i
just
told
you
padre
i
have
a
farthing
to
my
name
and
here
this
chap
in
the
village
telling
me
to
clear
out
of
fallowfield
that
i
got
from
my
father
and
his
father
before
him
so
how
the
devil
excuse
me
can
i
pay
rent
and
tithes
and
peters
pence
and
all
the
other
things
you
priest
chaps
expect
from
a
man
what
he
held
up
his
gauntleted
hand
as
father
ambrosius
started
to
speak
no
padre
not
another
word
about
it
i
know
you
love
to
tell
me
i
wo
go
to
heaven
if
i
act
this
way
i
do
doubt
you
learned
and
all
that
but
i
can
still
tell
you
a
thing
or
two
what
the
fact
is
i
go
to
heaven
you
see
padre
god
a
gentleman
and
he
would
bar
another
gentleman
over
a
trifle
of
money
trouble
that
could
happen
to
any
gentleman
now
would
he
the
fatuous
beam
was
more
than
father
ambrosius
could
bear
his
eyes
fell
sir
baldwin
chirped
and
that
saint
chap
name
was
hubert
i
did
forget
see
not
quite
the
fool
some
people
think
i
am
and
he
was
gone
whistling
a
recheat
father
ambrosius
sat
down
again
and
glared
at
the
parchment
preach
a
sermon
on
usury
for
that
popinjay
well
usury
a
sin
christians
were
supposed
to
lend
to
one
another
in
need
and
not
count
the
cost
or
the
days
but
who
had
ever
heard
of
sir
baldwin
ever
lending
anything
of
course
he
was
lord
of
the
manor
and
protected
you
against
invasion
but
there
did
seem
to
be
any
invasions
anymore
wearily
the
parish
priest
dipped
his
pen
and
scratched
on
the
parchment
ron
xiii
ii
viii
xv
i
whosoever
resisteth
the
power
resisteth
the
ordinance
of
god
owe
no
man
any
thing
we
that
are
strong
ought
to
bear
the
infirmities
of
the
weak
a
text
which
reinforced
by
a
brow
of
thunder
from
the
pulpit
should
make
the
village
goldsmith
think
twice
before
pressing
his
demand
on
sir
baldwin
usury
a
sin
there
was
a
different
knock
on
the
door
frame
the
goldsmith
a
fellow
named
john
stood
there
twisting
his
cap
in
his
big
burn
scarred
hands
yes
my
son
come
in
but
he
scowled
at
the
fellow
involuntarily
he
should
know
better
than
to
succumb
to
the
capital
sin
of
avarice
well
what
is
it
father
the
fellow
said
i
come
to
give
you
this
he
passed
a
soft
leather
purse
to
the
priest
it
clinked
father
ambrosius
emptied
it
on
his
desk
and
stirred
the
broad
silver
coins
wonderingly
with
his
finger
five
marks
and
eleven
silver
pennies
no
more
salt
herring
until
lent
silver
forwarded
to
his
bishop
in
an
amount
that
would
do
credit
to
the
parish
a
gilding
job
for
the
image
of
the
blessed
virgin
perhaps
glass
panes
in
one
or
two
of
the
church
windows
and
then
he
stiffened
and
swept
the
money
back
into
the
purse
you
got
this
by
sin
he
said
flatly
the
sin
of
avarice
worked
in
your
heart
and
you
practiced
the
sin
of
usury
on
your
fellow
christians
do
give
this
money
to
the
church
give
it
back
to
your
victims
father
the
fellow
said
nearly
blubbering
excuse
me
but
you
understand
they
come
to
me
and
come
to
me
they
say
it
all
right
with
them
that
they
hiring
the
money
the
way
you
hire
a
horse
that
make
sense
do
you
think
i
to
become
a
moneylender
no
i
was
an
honest
goldsmith
and
an
honest
goldsmith
ca
help
himself
all
the
money
in
the
village
drifts
somehow
into
his
hands
one
leaves
a
mark
with
you
for
safekeeping
and
pays
you
a
penny
the
year
to
guard
it
another
brings
you
silver
coins
to
make
into
a
basin
and
you
get
to
keep
whatever
coins
are
left
over
and
then
others
come
to
you
and
say
me
have
soandso
mark
to
use
for
a
year
and
then
i
pay
it
back
and
with
it
another
mark
father
they
beg
me
they
say
they
be
ruined
if
i
do
lend
to
them
their
old
parents
will
die
if
they
fee
the
leech
or
their
dead
will
roast
forever
unless
they
can
pay
for
masses
and
what
a
man
to
sin
no
more
the
priest
answered
simply
it
was
no
problem
the
fellow
was
getting
angry
very
well
for
you
to
sit
there
and
say
so
father
but
what
do
you
think
paid
for
the
masses
you
said
for
the
repose
of
goodie
howat
soul
and
how
did
tom
the
thatcher
buy
his
wagon
so
he
could
sell
his
beer
in
glastonbury
at
a
better
price
and
how
did
farmer
major
hire
the
men
from
wealing
to
get
in
his
hay
before
the
great
storm
could
ruin
it
and
a
hundred
things
more
i
tell
you
this
parish
would
be
a
worse
place
without
john
goldsmith
and
he
propose
to
be
pointed
at
any
longer
as
a
black
sinner
i
did
want
to
fall
into
usury
but
i
did
and
i
did
i
found
out
that
those
who
hoist
their
noses
highest
at
the
moneylender
when
they
pass
him
in
the
road
are
the
same
ones
who
beg
the
hardest
when
they
come
to
his
shop
for
a
loan
the
priest
was
stunned
by
the
outburst
john
seemed
honest
the
facts
were
the
facts
can
good
come
out
of
evil
and
there
were
stories
that
his
holiness
the
pope
himself
had
certain
dealings
with
the
longobards
benchers
or
bankers
or
whatever
they
called
themselves
i
must
think
on
this
my
son
he
said
perhaps
i
was
over
hasty
perhaps
in
the
days
of
paul
usury
was
another
thing
entirely
perhaps
what
you
practice
is
not
usury
but
merely
something
that
resembles
it
you
may
leave
this
silver
with
me
when
john
left
father
ambrosius
squeezed
his
eyes
tight
shut
and
pressed
the
knuckles
of
both
hands
to
his
forehead
things
change
under
the
dispensation
of
the
old
testament
men
had
more
wives
than
one
that
was
sinful
now
but
surely
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
were
in
heaven
paul
wrote
his
epistles
to
little
islands
of
christians
surrounded
by
seas
of
pagans
surely
in
those
days
it
was
necessary
for
christians
to
be
bound
closely
together
against
the
common
enemy
whereas
in
these
modern
times
the
ties
could
be
safely
relaxed
a
trifle
how
could
sinning
have
paid
for
the
repose
of
goodie
soul
got
a
better
price
for
brewer
thatcher
ale
and
saved
the
village
hay
crop
the
devil
was
tricky
but
not
tricky
surely
a
few
more
such
tricks
and
the
parish
would
resemble
the
paradise
terrestrial
father
ambrosius
dashed
from
his
study
to
the
altar
of
the
little
stone
church
and
began
furiously
to
turn
the
pages
of
the
huge
lectern
bible
the
love
of
money
is
the
root
of
all
evil
it
burst
on
father
ambrosius
with
a
great
light
that
the
words
of
paul
were
in
reference
not
to
love
of
money
but
to
love
of
money
he
dashed
back
to
his
study
and
his
pen
began
to
squeak
over
the
parchment
obliterating
the
last
dim
trace
of
tacitus
viii
the
sermon
would
be
a
scorcher
all
right
but
it
would
scorch
john
goldsmith
it
would
scorch
sir
baldwin
for
ruthlessly
and
against
the
laws
of
god
and
man
refusing
to
turn
fallowfield
over
to
the
moneylender
there
would
be
growls
of
approval
in
the
church
that
sunday
and
many
black
looks
directed
against
sir
baldwin
for
his
attempt
to
bilk
the
parish
friend
and
benefactor
the
moneylender
and
that
taylor
concluded
chuckling
is
how
power
passes
from
one
pair
of
hands
to
another
and
how
public
acceptance
of
the
change
follows
on
its
heels
a
strange
thing
people
always
think
that
each
exchange
of
power
is
the
last
that
will
ever
take
place
he
seemed
to
be
finished
uncle
orsino
said
somebody
tried
to
kill
me
taylor
stared
at
him
for
a
long
minute
speechless
what
happened
he
finally
asked
i
went
formal
to
the
theater
with
five
bodyguards
the
chief
guard
name
of
halloran
took
a
shot
at
me
one
of
my
boys

in

was

tried
to
kill

clicked
off

board

and
turned
grimly
to
orsino
now
you
he
said
what
have
been
up
to
just
doing
my
job
uncle
orsino
said
uneasily
still
bagman
at
the
yes
fooling
with

lately
certainly
not
the

east

why
are
you
taking

so
heavy
because
you

you
tell
me
about
this

orsino
very
much
a

never
been

knew
why
the

was
being
made
and
did

the

edward

wagged
his
formidable
white
beard
at
the
syndic

around

growled

think
we
dispense

so
on
i
want
to
talk
about
this

a
rumor
a
dubious
report
and
a
note
on
a
man
hobby
you
want
us
to
sweep
the
bastards
from
the
sea
do
you
just
the
way
you
always
have
i
am
not
ashamed
of
my
expressed
attitude
on
the
question
of
the
united
states
government
and
will
defend
it
at
any
proper
time
and
place
shut
the
hell
up
you
two
edward
falcaro
growled
i
trying
to
think
he
thought
for
perhaps
half
a
minute
and
then
looked
up
baffled
has
anybody
got
any
ideas
charles
orsino
cleared
his
throat
amazed
at
his
own
temerity
the
old
man
eyebrows
shot
up
but
he
grudgingly
said
i
guess
you
can
say
something
since
they
thought
you
were
important
enough
to
shoot
orsino
said
maybe
it
some
outfit
over
in
europe
or
asia
edward
falcaro
asked
anybody
know
anything
about
europe
or
asia
jimmy
you
flew
over
once
did
you
to
see
about
anatolian
poppies
when
the
mob
had
trouble
with
mex
labor
jimmy
falcaro
said
creakily
yeah
it
was
a
waste
of
time
they
have
these
little
dirt
farmers
scratching
out
just
enough
food
for
the
family
and
maybe
raising
a
of
poppy
that
there
is
from
the
china
sea
to
the
mediterranean
in
england
frank
you
tell
you
explained
it
to
me
once
taylor
rose
the
forest
come
back
to
england
when
finance
there
lost
its
morale
and
could
hack
its
way
out
of
the
paradoxes
that
was
the
end
when
that
happens
you
got
to
have
a
large
virile
criminal
class
ready
to
take
over
and
do
the
work
of
distribution
and
production
maybe
some
of
you
know
how
the
english
were
the
poor
beggars
had
civilized
all
the
illegality
out
of
the
stock
they
could
do
anything
that
was
respectable
from
sketchy
reports
i
gather
that
england
is
now
forest
and
a
few
hundred
starving
people
one
fellow
says
the
men
still
wear
derbies
and
stagger
to
their
offices
in
the
city
france
is
peasants
drunk
of
the
time
russia
is
peasants
drunk
the
time
germany
well
there
the
criminal
class
was
big
and
virile
the
place
is
a
cemetery
he
shrugged
say
it
somebody
the
mob
gunning
for
us
reiner
jumped
to
his
feet
i
will
support
such
a
hypothesis
he
shrilled
it
is
to
imply
that
a
century
of
peace
has
been
ended
that
our
border
with
our
friend
to
the
west
taylor
intoned
satirically
my
friends
by
a
edward
falcaro
yelled
stop
your
damn
foolishness
frank
taylor
this
is
no
laughing
matter
taylor
snapped
have
you
been
in
mob
territory
lately
i
have
the
old
man
said
he
scowled
how
you
like
it
edward
falcaro
shrugged
irritably
they
have
their
ways
we
have
ours
the
regan
line
is
running
thin
but
we
not
going
to
forget
that
jimmy
regan
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
amadeo
falcaro
in
the
old
days
there
such
a
thing
as
loyalty
taylor
said
there
such
a
thing
as
blindness
he
had
gone
too
far
edward
falcaro
rose
from
his
chair
and
leaned
forward
bracing
himself
on
the
table
he
said
flatly
this
is
a
statement
gentlemen
i
wo
pretend
i
happy
about
the
way
things
are
in
mob
territory
i
wo
pretend
i
think
old
man
regan
is
a
balanced
dependable
person
i
wo
pretend
i
think
the
mob
clients
are
enjoying
anywhere
near
the
service
that
syndic
clients
enjoy
i
perfectly
aware
that
on
our
visits
of
state
to
mob
territory
we
see
pretty
much
what
our
hosts
want
us
to
see
but
i
can
not
believe
that
any
group
which
is
rooted
on
the
principles
of
freedom
and
service
can
have
gone
very
wrong
maybe
i
mistaken
gentlemen
but
i
can
not
believe
that
a
descendant
of
jimmy
regan
would
order
a
descendant
of
amadeo
falcaro
murdered
we
will
consider
every
other
possibility
first
frank
is
that
clear
yes
taylor
said
all
right
edward
falcaro
grunted
now
let
go
about
this
thing
systematically
dick
you
go
right
down
the
line
with
the
charge
that
the
government
responsible
for
these
atrocities
i
hate
to
think
that
myself
if
they
are
we
going
to
have
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
and
trouble
hunting
them
down
and
doing
something
about
it
as
long
as
they
stick
to
a
little
and
a
few
coastal
attacks
i
say
i
really
unhappy
about
them
they
do
do
much
harm
and
they
keep
us
on
our
toes
and
maybe
this
one
is
most
important
they
keep
our
client
memories
of
the
bad
old
days
that
we
delivered
them
from
alive
that
a
great
deal
to
surrender
for
the
doubtful
pleasures
of
a
long
expensive
campaign
if
assassination
in
the
picture
i
suppose
have
to
knock
them
off
but
we
got
to
be
may
i
speak
reiner
asked
icily
the
old
man
nodded
and
his
cigar
i
have
been
called
behind
my
back
naturally
a
fanatic
reiner
said
he
pointedly
did
not
look
anywhere
near
taylor
as
he
spoke
the
word
perhaps
this
is
correct
and
perhaps
fanaticism
is
needed
at
a
time
like
this
let
me
point
out
what
the
government
stands
for
brutal
extirpation
of
gambling
denial
of
life
simple
pleasures
to
the
poor
and
severe
limitation
of
them
to
all
but
the
wealthy
sexual
prudery
viciously
enforced
by
penal
laws
of
appalling
barbarity
endless
regulation
and
coercion
governing
every
waking
minute
of
the
day
that
was
its
record
during
the
days
of
its
power
and
that
would
be
its
record
if
it
returned
to
power
i
fail
to
see
how
this
menace
to
our
liberty
can
be
condoned
by
certain
marginal
benefits
which
are
claimed
to
accrue
from
its
continued
existence
he
faltered
for
a
moment
as
his
face
twisted
with
an
unpleasant
memory
in
a
lower
unhappier
voice
he
went
on
i
i
was
alarmed
the
other
day
by
something
i
overheard
two
small
children
were
laying
bets
at
the
kiddy
counter
of
the
horse
room
i
frequent
and
i
stopped
on
my
way
to
the
window
for
a
moment
to
hear
their
childish
prattle
they
were
doping
the
forms
for
the
sixth
at
hialeah
i
believe
when
one
of
them
digressed
to
say
mommy
play
the
horses
she
thinks
all
the
horse
rooms
should
be
closed
it
wrung
my
heart
gentlemen
to
hear
that
i
wanted
to
take
that
little
boy
aside
and
tell
him
your
mommy
does
have
to
play
the
horses
nobody
has
to
play
the
horses
unless
he
wants
to
but
as
long
as
one
single
person
wants
to
lay
a
bet
on
a
horse
and
another
person
is
willing
to
take
it
nobody
has
the
right
to
say
the
horse
rooms
should
be
closed
naturally
i
did
not
take
the
little
boy
aside
and
tell
him
that
it
would
have
been
an
impractical
approach
to
the
problem
the
approach
is
the
one
i
have
always
advocated
and
still
do
strike
at
the
heart
of
the
infection
destroy
the
remnants
of
government
and
cauterize
the
wound
so
that
it
will
never
again
nor
is
my
language
too
strong
when
i
realize
that
the
mind
of
an
innocent
child
has
been
corrupted
so
that
he
will
prattle
that
the
liberties
of
his
brothers
must
be
infringed
on
that
their
harmless
pleasures
must
be
curtailed
my
blood
runs
cold
and
i
call
it
what
it
is
orsino
had
listened
raptly
to
the
words
and
joined
in
a
burst
of
spontaneous
applause
that
swept
around
the
table
he
had
never
had
a
brush
with
government
himself
and
he
hardly
believed
in
the
existence
of
the
shadowy
terrorist
but
reiner
had
made
it
sound
so
near
and
menacing
but
uncle
frank
was
on
his
feet
we
seem
to
have
strayed
from
the
point
he
said
dryly
for
anybody
who
needs
his
memory
refreshed
state
that
the
point
is
two
assassinations
and
one
near
miss
i
fail
to
see
the
connection
if
any
with
dick
reiner
paranoid
delusions
of
persecution
i
especially
fail
to
see
the
relevance
of
the
word
treason
to
what
us
the
syndic
is
not
a
government
it
must
not
become
enmeshed
in
the
symbols
and
folklore
of
a
government
or
it
will
be
first
chained
and
then
strangled
by
them
the
syndic
is
an
organization
of
high
morale
and
hedonistic
personality
the
fact
that
it
succeeded
the
government
occurred
because
the
government
had
become
an
organization
of
low
morale
and
inflexible
puritanic
personality
i
have
no
illusions
about
the
syndic
lasting
forever
and
i
hope
nobody
else
here
has
naturally
i
want
it
to
last
our
lifetime
my
children
lifetime
and
as
long
after
that
as
i
can
visualize
my
descendants
but
do
think
i
have
any
burning
affection
for
my
unborn
grandchildren
now
if
there
is
anybody
here
who
does
want
it
to
last
that
long
i
suggest
to
him
that
the
quickest
way
to
demoralize
the
syndic
is
to
adopt
dick
proposal
of
a
holy
war
for
a
starter
from
there
we
can
proceed
to
an
internal
heresy
hunt
a
census
excise
taxes
income
taxes
and
wars
of
aggression
now
what
about
getting
back
to
the
assassinations
orsino
shook
his
head
thoroughly
confused
by
now
but
the
confusion
vanished
as
a
girl
entered
the
room
whispered
something
in
the
ear
of
edward
falcaro
and
sat
down
calmly
by
his
side
he
was
the
only
one
who
noticed
her
most
of
the
faces
there
registered
surprise
and
some
indignation
the
syndic
had
a
very
strong
tradition
of
masculinity
edward
falcaro
ignored
the
surprise
and
indignation
he
said
placidly
that
was
very
interesting
frank
what
i
understood
of
it
but
always
interesting
when
i
go
ahead
and
do
something
because
it
the
smart
thing
to
do
and
then
listen
to
you
explain
my
reasons
including
fifty
or
sixty
that
i
more
than
positive
never
crossed
my
mind
there
was
a
laugh
around
the
table
that
charles
orsino
thought
was
unfair
he
knew
edward
falcaro
knew
and
everybody
knew
that
taylor
credited
falcaro
with
sound
intuitive
judgment
rather
than
analytic
power
he
supposed
the
old
man
intuitively
had
decided
a
laugh
was
needed
to
clear
the
air
of
the
quarrel
and
irrelevance
falcaro
went
on
the
way
things
stand
now
gentlemen
we
do
know
very
much
do
we
he
bit
a
fresh
cigar
and
lighted
it
meditatively
from
a
cloud
of
rank
smoke
he
said
so
the
thing
to
do
is
find
out
more
is
it
in
spite
of
the
beard
and
the
cigar
there
was
something
of
a
sly
teasing
child
about
him
so
what
do
you
say
to
slipping
one
of
our
own
people
into
the
government
to
find
out
whether
they
dealing
in
assassination
or
not
charles
orsino
alone
was
naive
enough
to
speak
the
rest
knew
that
the
old
man
had
something
up
his
sleeve
charles
said
you
ca
do
it
sir
they
have
and
drugs
and
all
sorts
of
things
his
voice
died
down
miserably
under
falcaro
smile
and
the
looks
of
irritation
verging
on
disgust
from
the
rest
the
enigmatic
girl
scowled
them
all
charles
thought
sinking
into
his
chair
and
wishing
he
could
sink
into
the
earth
the
young
man
falcaro
said
blandly
speaks
the
truth
no
less
true
for
being
somewhat
familiar
to
us
all
but
what
if
we
have
a
way
to
get
around
the
drugs
and
gentlemen
which
of
you
bold
fellows
would
march
into
the
jaws
of
death
by
joining
the
government
spying
on
them
and
trying
to
report
back
charles
stood
up
prudence
and
timidity
washed
away
by
a
burning
need
to
make
up
for
his
embarrassment
with
a
grandstand
play
i
go
sir
he
said
very
calmly
if
i
get
killed
that
show
then
they
be
good
boy
edward
falcaro
said
briskly
with
a
that
air
the
young
lady
here
will
take
care
of
you
charles
steadily
walked
down
the
long
room
to
the
head
of
the
table
thinking
that
he
must
be
cutting
a
rather
fine
figure
uncle
frank
ruined
his
exit
by
catching
his
sleeve
and
halting
him
as
he
passed
his
seat
good
luck
charles
uncle
frank
whispered
and
for
sake
keep
a
better
guard
up
ca
you
see
the
old
devil
planned
it
this
way
from
the
beginning
uncle
frank
charles
said
suddenly
feeling
quite
sick
as
he
walked
on
the
young
lady
rose
and
opened
the
door
for
him
she
was
graceful
as
a
cat
and
a
conviction
overcame
charles
orsino
that
he
was
the
canary
v
max
wyman
shoved
his
way
through
such
a
roar
of
voices
and
such
a
crush
of
bodies
as
he
had
never
known
before
scratch
sheet

was
bright
as

brighter
atomic

mounted
on

hosed
and
squirted
the

the
roar
of
voices
had
become
insane
max
wyman
held
his
head
hating
it
hating
them
all
trying
to
shut
them
out
half
a
dozen
young
men
against
whom
he
was
jammed
were
tearing
the
clothes
off
a
girl
they
were
laughing
and
she
was
too
making
only
a
pretense
of
defending
herself
it
was
one
of
new
york
mild
winter
nights
wyman
looked
at
the
white
skin
not
knowing
that
his
eyes
gloated
he
yelled
curses
at
her
and
the
young
men
but
nobody
heard
his
young
voice
somebody
thrust
a
bottle
at
him
and
made
mouths
trying
to
yell
happy
new
year
he
grabbed
feverishly
at
the
bottle
and
held
it
to
his
mouth
letting
the
liquor
gurgle
once
twice
three
times
then
the
bottle
was
snatched
away
not
by
the
man
who
had
passed
it
to
him
a
hilarious
fat
woman
plastered
herself
against
wyman
and
kissed
him
clingingly
on
the
mouth
to
his
horror
and
disgust
she
was
torn
away
from
him
by
a
laughing
man
and
turned
willingly
to
kissing
him
instead
two
strapping
girls
jockeyed
wyman
between
them
and
began
to
tear
clothes
off
laughing
at
their
switcheroo
on
the
year
big
gag
he
clawed
out
at
them
hysterically
and
they
stopped
the
laughter
dying
on
their
lips
as
they
saw
his
look
of
terrified
rage
a
sudden
current
in
the
crowd
parted
wyman
from
them
another
bottle
bobbed
on
the
sea
of
humanity
he
clutched
at
it
and
this
time
did
not
drink
he
stuffed
it
hurriedly
under
the
waistband
of
his
shorts
and
kept
a
hand
on
it
as
the
eddy
of
humanity
bore
him
on
to
the
fringes
of
the
roaring
mob
leaders

wyman
was
mashed
up
against
a
girl
who
first
smiled
at
his
young
face
invitingly
and
then
looked
again
get
away
from
me
she
shrieked
pounding
on
his
chest
with
her
small
fists
you
could
hear
individual
voices
now
but
the
crowd
was
still
dense
she
kept
screaming
at
him
and
hitting
him
until
suddenly
scratch
sheet
square
upramp
loomed
and
the
crowd
fizzed
onto
it
like
uncorked
champagne
wyman
and
the
screaming
girl
carried
along
the
moving
plates
underfoot
the
crowd
boiled
onto
the
northbound
strip
relieving
the
crush
the
girl
vanished
whimpering
into
the
mob
wyman
rubbing
his
ear
mechanically
shuffled
with
downcast
eyes
to
the
eastbound
ramp
and
collapsed
onto
a
bench
gliding
by
at
five
miles
per
hour
he
looked
stupidly
at
the
and
strips
but
did
not
dare
step
onto
them
he
had
been
drinking
steadily
for
a
month
he
would
fall
and
the
bottle
would
break
he
lurched
off
the
strip
at
riverside
downramp
nobody
got
off
with
him
riverside
was
a
tangle
of
freightways
over
under
and
on
the
surface
he
worked
there
wyman
picked
his
way
past
throbbing
conveyors
roofed
against
pilferage
under
gurgling
fuel
and
water
and
waste
pipes
around
vast
metal
warehouses
and
storage
tanks
it
was
not
dark
or
idle
in
riverside
hours
was
little
enough
time
to
bring
manhattan
its

of

at

hitched
his

over
the
bottle
and
swayed
in
drunk
enough
to
think
he
could
pretend
he
was
sober
hi
he
said
hoarsely
to
the
shift
foreman
got
jammed
up
in
the
celebration
we
heard
it
clear
over
here
the
foreman
said
looking
at
him
closely
are
you
all
right
max
the
question
enraged
him
he
yelled
had
a
couple
sure
think
drunk
tha
wha
ya

gee
the
foreman
said
wearily
look
max
i
ca
send
you
out
tonight
you
might
get
killed
i
trying
to
be
reasonable
and
i
wish
you
do
as
much
for
me
what
biting
you
boy
nobody
has
anything
against
a
few
drinks
and
a
few
laughs
i
went
on
a
bender
last
month
myself
but
you
get
so
goddammed
i
ca
stand
you
and
neither
can
anybody
else
wyman
spewed
obscenity
at
him
and
tried
to
swing
on
him
he
was
surprised
and
filled
with
when
somebody
caught
his
arm
and
somebody
else
caught
his
other
arm
it
was
dooley
and
weintraub
his
looking
unhappy
and
concerned
lousy
rats
wyman
choked
out
leas
a
man
buddies
c
do
is
up
he
began
to
cry
hating
them
and
then
fell
asleep
on
his
feet
dooley
and
weintraub
eased
him
down
onto
the
floor
the
foreman
mopped
his
head
and
appealed
to
dooley
he
always
like
this
he
had
been
transferred
to
station
only
two
weeks
before
dooley
shrugged
you
might
say
so
he
showed
up
about
three
months
ago
said
he
used
to
be
a
breakdown
man
in
buffalo
on
the
yards
he
knew
the
work
all
right
but
i
never
saw
such
a
mean
kid
never
a
good
word
for
anybody
never
any
fun
booze
booze
booze
this
time
he
really
let
go
weintraub
said
unexpectedly
i
think
he
what
they
used
to
call
an
alcoholic
what
the
hell
that
the
foreman
demanded
i
read
about
it
it
something
they
used
to
have
before
the
syndic
i
read
about
it
things
were
a
lot
different
then
people
picking
on
you
all
the
time
everybody
mad
all
the
time
the
girls
were
scared
to
give
it
away
and
the
boys
were
scared
to
take
it
but
they
did
anyway
and
it
was
kind
of
like
fighting
with
yourself
yourself
the
fighting
wore
some
people
out
so
much
they
just
could
take
it
any
more
instead
of
going
on
benders
for
a
change
of
pace
like
sensible
people
they
boozed
the
time
and
they
had
a
fight
inside
themselves
about
so
they
boozed
harder
he
looked
defensive
at
their
skeptical
faces
i
it
he
insisted
well
the
foreman
said
inconclusively
i
heard
things
used
to
be
pretty
bad
did
these
alcoholers
get
over
it
i
do
know
weintraub
admitted
i
did
read
that
far
hm
i
think
i
better
can
him
the
foreman
was
studying
their
faces
covertly
hoping
to
read
a
reaction
he
did
both
the
men
looked
relieved
yeh
i
think
i
better
can
him
he
can
go
to
the
syndic
for
relief
if
he
has
to
he
does
do
us
much
good
here
put
some
soup
on
and
get
it
down
him
when
he
wakes
up
the
foreman
an
average
kindly
man
hoped
the
soup
would
help
but
at
about
after
two
trouble
calls
in
succession
they
noticed
that
wyman
had
left
leaving
no
word
the
fat
little
man
struggled
out
of
the
new
year
eve
throng
he
had
been
caught
by
accident
commander
grinnel
did
not
go
in
for
celebrations
when
he
realized
that
january
fifteenth
was
now
fifteen
days
away
he
doubted
that
he
would
ever
celebrate
again
it
was
a
job
he
had
to
do
on
the
fifteenth
and
so
far
he
had
not
found
the
other
man
he
rode
the
slidewalk
to
columbus
square
he
had
been
supplied
with
a
minimum
list
of
contacts
one
had
moved
and
in
the
crazily
undisciplined
syndic
territory
it
was
impossible
to
trace
anybody
another
had
died
of
too
much
morphine
another
had
beaten
her
husband
almost
to
death
with
a
chair
leg
and
was
in
custody
awaiting
trial
the
commander
wondered
briefly
and
querulously
why
do
we
always
have
such
unstable
people
here
or
does
that
louse
emory
deliberately
saddle
me
with
them
when
i
on
a
mission
would
put
it
past
him
the
final
contact
on
the
list
was
a
woman
she
be
worthless
for
the
business
of
january
fifteenth
that
called
for
some
physical
strength
some
technical
knowledge
and
a
residual
usefulness
to
the
government
professor
speiser
had
done
some
good
work
here
on
industrial
sabotage
but
taken
away
from
the
scene
of
possible
operations
she
just
be
a
millstone
he
had
his
record
to
think
of
sabotage
if
a
giggling
threesome
had
been
looking
his
way
from
a
bench
across
the
slidewalk
he
would
have
ground
his
teeth
in
recent
weeks
he
had
done
what
he
estimated
as
an
easy
three
million
dollars
worth
of
damage
to
mob
territory
industry
and
the
stupid
fools
had
it
repair
crews
had
rebuilt
the
fallen
walls
mechanics
had
over
the
wrecked
engines
and
replaced
them
troubleshooters
had
troubleshot
the
scores
of
severed
communications
lines
and
fuel
mains
he
had
hung
around
sam
you
see
this
melted
through
like
with
a
little
thermite
bomb
how
in
the
hell
did
a
thing
like
that
happen
i
do
know
i
was
here
let
get
it
fixed
kid
okay
you
think
we
ought
to
report
this
to
somebody
if
you
want
to
i
mention
it
to
larry
but
i
do
see
what
he
can
do
about
it
must
been
some
kids
you
got
ta
put
it
down
as
fair
wear
and
tear
but
boys
will
be
boys
remembering
he
did
grind
his
teeth
but
they
were
at
columbus
square
professor
speiser
lived
in
one
of
the
old
plastic
brick
faculty
houses
her
horsy
face
under
a
curling
net
looked
out
of
the
annunciator
plate
yes
what
is
it
professor
speiser
i
believe
you
know
my
daughter
miss
she
asked
me
to
look
you
up
while
i
was
in
new
york
have
i
come
much
too
late
oh
dear
why
no
i
suppose
not
come
in
mr
freeman
in
her
parlor
she
faced
him
apprehensively
when
she
spoke
she
rolled
out
her
sentences
like
the
lecturer
she
was
freeman
as
i
suppose
you
prefer
me
to
call
you
you
asked
a
moment
ago
whether
you
come
too
late
i
realize
that
the
question
was
but
my
answer
is
quite
serious
you
have
come
too
late
i
have
decided
to
dissociate
myself
from
let
us
say
from
your
daughter
miss
freeman
the
commander
asked
only
is
that
irrevocable
quite
it
would
be
fair
of
me
to
ask
you
to
leave
without
an
explanation
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
give
one
i
realize
now
that
my
friendship
with
miss
freeman
and
the
work
i
did
for
her
stemmed
from
let
us
say
a
certain
vacancy
in
my
life
he
looked
at
a
picture
on
her
desk
of
a
bald
fellow
with
a
pipe
she
followed
his
eyes
and
said
with
a
sort
of
shy
pride
that
is
mordecai
of
the
university
faculty
of
dentistry
like
myself
a
celibate
we
plan
to
marry
the
commander
said
do
you
feel
that
mordecai
might
like
to
meet
my
daughter
no
i
do
not
we
expect
to
have
very
little
time
for
outside
activities
between
our
professional
careers
and
our
personal
lives
please
do
misunderstand
freeman
i
am
still
your
friend
i
always
shall
be
but
somehow
i
no
longer
find
in
myself
an
urgency
to
express
the
friendship
it
seems
like
a
beautiful
dream
and
a
quite
futile
one
i
have
come
to
realize
that
one
can
live
a
full
life
without
miss
freeman
now
it
getting
quite
late
he
smiled
ruefully
and
rose
may
i
wish
you
every
happiness
professor
speiser
he
said
extending
his
hand
she
beamed
with
relief
i
was
so
afraid
you
her
face
went
limp
and
she
stood
swaying
drunkenly
as
the
needle
in
the
ring
popped
her
skin
the
commander
his
face
as
dead
as
hers
disconnected
his
hand
and
sheathed
the
needle
carefully
again
he
drew
one
of
his
guns
shot
her
through
the
heart
and
walked
out
of
the
apartment
old
fool
she
should
have
known
better
max
wyman
stumbled
through
the
tangle
of
riveredge
his
head
a
pot
of
molten
lead
and
his
legs
twitching
under
him
as
he
fled
from
his
shame
dimly
as
if
with
new
eyes
he
saw
that
he
was
not
alone
riveredge
was
technically
uninhabited
then
what
voices
called
guardedly
to
him
from
the
shadows
buddy
buddy
wait
up
a
minute
buddy
did
you
score
did
you
score
he
lurched
on
and
the
voices
became
bolder
the
snaking
conveyors
and
ramps
sliced
out
sectors
of
space
storage
tanks
merged
with
inflow
mains
to
form
sheltered
spots
where
they
met
no
spot
was
without
its
whining
appealing
voice
he
stood
at
last
quivering
leaning
against
a
gigantic
that
supported
a
freightway
a
scrap
sheet
of
corrugated
iron
rested
against
the
bay
of
the
and
the
sheet
quivered
and
fell
outward
an
old
man
voice
said
you
beat
son
come
on
in
he
staggered
a
step
forward
and
collapsed
on
a
pallet
of
rags
as
somebody
carefully
leaned
the
sheet
back
into
place
again
vi
max
wyman
woke
raving
with
the
chuck
horrors
there
was
somebody
there
to
hand
him
candy
bars
sweet
lemonade
lump
sugar
there
was
somebody
to
shove
him
easily
back
into
the
pallet
of
rags
when
he
tried
to
stumble
forth
in
a
hunt
for
booze
on
the
second
day
he
realized
that
it
was
an
old
man
whose
face
looked
gray
and
paralyzed
his
name
was
pendelton
he
said
after
a
week
he
let
max
wyman
take
little
walks
about
their
part
of
riverside
but
not
by
night
we
got
some
savage
people
here
he
said
they
murder
you
for
a
pint
the
women
are
worse
if
one
calls
to
you
do
go
you
wind
up
dumped
through
a
manhole
into
the
hudson
poor
folk
you
for
them
wyman
asked
startled
it
was
a
new
idea
to
him
since
buffalo
he
had
never
been
sorry
for
anybody
something
awful
had
happened
there
some
terrible
betrayal
he
passed
his
bony
hand
across
his
forehead
he
did
want
to
think
about
it
would
i
live
here
if
i
were
asked
him
sometimes
i
can
help
them
there
nobody
else
to
help
them
they
old
and
sick
and
they
do
fit
anywhere
that
why
they
savage
you
young
the
only
young
man
i
ever
seen
in
riveredge
there
so
much
outside
for
the
young
but
when
you
get
old
it
sometimes
throws
you
the
goddammed
syndic
wyman
snarled
full
of
hate
shrugged
maybe
it
too
easy
for
sick
old
people
to
get
booze
they
lose
somebody
they
spent
a
life
with
and
it
throws
them
people
harden
into
a
pattern
they
always
had
fun
they
think
they
always
will
then
half
of
the
pattern
gone
and
they
ca
stand
it
some
of
them
you
got
it
early
what
was
the
ringing
bell
wyman
collapsed
into
the
bay
of
the
as
if
he
been
kicked
in
the
stomach
a
wave
of
intolerable
memory
swept
over
him
a
ringing
bell
a
wobbling
pendulum
a
flashing
light
the
fair
face
of
his
betrayer
the
hateful
one
of
hogan
stirred
together
in
a
hell
brew
nothing
he
said
hoarsely
thinking
that
he
give
his
life
for
enough
booze
to
black
him
out
nothing
you
kept
talking
about
it
said
was
it
real
it
could
have
been
wyman
muttered
there
are
such
things
no
there
was
her
and
that
syndic
and
that
louse
hogan
i
do
want
to
talk
about
it
suit
yourself
he
did
talk
about
it
later
curiously
clouded
though
it
was
the
years
in
buffalo
the
violent
love
affair
with
inge
the
catastrophic
scene
when
he
found
her
with
regan
mobster
the
way
he
felt
turned
the
lifetime
of
faith
in
the
syndic
behind
him
and
the
lifetime
of
a
faith
in
inge
ahead
of
him
both
wrecked
the
booze
the
flight
from
buffalo
to
erie
to
pittsburgh
to
tampa
to
new
york
and
somehow
insistently
the
ringing
bell
the
wobbling
pendulum
and
the
flashing
light
that
kept
intruding
between
episodes
of
reality
listened
patiently
fed
him
hid
him
when
infrequent
patrols
went
by
never
told
him
his
own
story
but
a
bloated
woman
who
lived
with
a
man
in
an
abandoned
storage
tank
did
one
day
her
voice
echoing
from
the
curving
windowless
walls
of
corrugated
plastic
she
said
had
been
an
alky
chemist
reasonably
prosperous
reasonably
happy
reasonably
married
his
wife
was
the
faithful
kind
and
he
was
not
with
unbelievable
slyness
she
had
dulled
the
pain
for
years
with
booze
and
he
had
never
suspected
they
say
she
had
killed
herself
after
one
frightful
debauche
in
riveredge
came
down
to
riveredge
for
the
body
and
returned
after
giving
it
burial
and
drawing
his
savings
from
the
bank
he
had
never
left
riveredge
since
the
grun
that
man
walks
on
the
bloated
woman
mumbled
gets
mad
nev
calls
you
hard
names
give
bottle
if
y
need
it
talk
to
y
if
y
blue
that
man
max
wyman
walked
from
the
storage
tank
sickened
charity
covered
that
creature
and
him
it
was
the
day
he
told
i
getting
out
of
here
the
gray
face
almost
smiled
see
a
man
first
friend
of
yours
somebody
who
heard
about
you
maybe
he
can
do
something
for
you
he
feels
the
way
you
do
about
the
syndic
wyman
clenched
his
teeth
the
pain
still
came
at
the
thought
syndic
hogan
inge
and
betrayal
god
to
be
able
to
hit
back
at
them
the
red
ride
ebbed
suddenly
he
stared
at
and
demanded
why
why
should
you
put
me
in
touch
what
is
this
shrugged
i
do
worry
about
the
syndic
i
worry
about
people
i
been
worrying
about
you
you
a
little
insane
max
like
all
of
us
here
god
damn
you
he
has
max
wyman
paused
a
long
time
and
said
go
on
will
you
he
realized
that
anybody
else
would
have
apologized
but
he
could
and
he
knew
that
knew
he
could
the
old
man
said
a
little
insane
hatred
it
better
out
of
you
than
in
it
better
to
sock
the
man
you
hate
and
stand
a
chance
of
having
him
sock
you
back
than
it
is
just
to
hate
him
and
let
the
hate
gnaw
you
like
a
what
you
got
against
the
syndic
nothing
max
nothing
against
it
and
nothing
for
it
what
i
for
is
people
the
syndic
is
people
you
people
slug
if
you
want
and
they
have
a
chance
to
slug
you
back
maybe
you
pull
down
the
syndic
like
samson
in
the
temple
more
likely
it
crush
you
but
you
be
something
about
it
that
the
great
thing
that
the
thing
people
have
to
learn
or
they
wind
up
in
riveredge
you
crazy
i
told
you
i
was
or
i
would
be
here
the
man
came
at
sunset
he
was
short
and
pudgy
with
a
halo
of
wispy
hair
and
the
coldest
grimmest
eyes
that
wyman
had
ever
seen
he
shook
hands
with
wyman
and
the
young
man
noted
simultaneously
a
sharp
pain
in
his
finger
and
that
the
stranger
wore
an
elaborate
gold
ring
then
the
world
got
hazy
and
confused
he
had
a
sense
that
he
was
being
asked
questions
that
he
was
answering
them
that
it
went
on
for
hours
and
hours
when
things
quite
suddenly
came
into
focus
again
the
pudgy
man
was
saying
i
can
introduce
myself
now
commander
grinnel
of
the
north
american
navy
my
assignment
is
recruiting
the
preliminary
examination
has
satisfied
me
that
you
are
no
plant
and
would
be
a
desirable
citizen
of
the
a

your

said
kill
me
some
syndics
the
commander
stared
at
him
with
those
cold
eyes
he
said
at
last
it
can
probably
be
arranged
come
with
me
they
went
by
train
to
cape
cod
at
midnight
on
january
the
commander
and
wyman
left
their
hotel
room
and
strolled
about
the
streets
the
commander
taped
small
packets
to
the
four
legs
of
the
microwave
relay
tower
that
connected
cape
cod
with
the
continental
press
common
carrier
circuits
and
taped
other
packets
to
the
police
motor
pool
gate
at
the
tower
exploded
and
the
motor
pool
gate
fused
into
an
impassible
puddle
of
molten
metal
simultaneously
fifty
men
in
sweaters
and
caps
appeared
from
nowhere
on
center
street
half
of
them
barricaded
the
street
firing
on
citizens
and
cops
who
came
too
close
the
others
systematically
looted
every
store
between
the
barricade
and
the
beach
blinking
a
flashlight
in
code
the
commander
approached
the
deadline
unmolested
and
was
let
through
with
wyman
at
his
heels
the
goods
the
raiders
the
commander
and
wyman
were
aboard
a
submarine
by
and
under
way
ten
minutes
later
after
commander
grinnel
had
exchanged
congratulations
with
the
sub
commander
he
presented
wyman
a
recruit
normally
i
would
have
bothered
but
he
had
a
rather
special
motivation
he
could
be
very
useful
the
sub
commander
studied
wyman
impersonally
if
he
not
a
plant
i
used
my
ring
if
you
want
to
get
it
over
with
we
can
test
him
and
swear
him
in
now
they
strapped
him
into
a
device
that
recorded
pulse
perspiration
respiration
and
brainwaves
a
sweatered
specialist
came
and
mildly
asked
wyman
questions
about
his
surroundings
while
he
calibrated
the
polygraph
then
came
the
wyman
did
not
fail
to
note
that
the
sub
commander
loosened
his
gun
in
his
holster
when
the
questioning
began

age
and

i
would
have
you
any
reservations
yet
unstated
in
your

no
it
went
on
for
an
hour
the
questions
were
continuously
after
each
of
wyman
firm
answers
the
sweatered
technician
gave
a
satisfied
little
nod
at
last
it
ended
and
he
was
unstrapped
from
the
device
max
was
tired
the
sub
commander
seemed
a
little
awed
as
he
got
a
small
book
and
read
from
it
do
you
max
wyman
solemnly
renounce
all
allegiances
previously
held
by
you
and
pledge
your
allegiance
to
the
north

do
the
young
man
said
fiercely
in
a
remote
corner
of
his
mind
for
the
first
time
in
months
the
bell
ceased
to
ring
the
pendulum

beat
and
the
light
to
flash
charles
orsino
knew
again
who
he
was
and
what
was
his
mission
vii
it
had
begun
when
the
girl
led
him
through
the
conference
room
door
naturally
one
had
misgivings
naturally
one
did
speak
up
but
the
door
far
downstairs
was
terrifying
when
it
yawned
before
you
and
even
more
so
when
it
closed
behind
you
what
is
this
place
he
demanded
at
last
who
are
you
she
said
psychology
lab
it
produced
on
him
the
same
effect
that
alchemy
section
or
division
of
astrology
would
have
on
a
young
man
in
he
repeated
flatly
psychology
lab
if
you
do
want
to
tell
me
very
well
i
volunteered
without
strings
which
should
remind
her
that
he
was
a
sort
of
hero
and
should
be
treated
with
a
certain
amount
of
dignity
and
that
she
could
save
her
corny
jokes
i
meant
it
she
said
fiddling
busily
with
the
locks
of
yet
another
door
i
a
psychologist
i
also
by
the
way
lee
falcaro
since
you
asked
the
old
man
edward
falcaro
line
he
asked
simon
pure
he
my
father
brother
father
down
in
miami
handling
the
tracks
and
gaming
in
general
the
second
big
door
opened
on
a
room
whose
air
had
a
curiously
dead
feel
to
it
sit
down
she
said
indicating
a
very
unorthodox
chair
he
did
and
found
that
the
chair
was
the
most
comfortable
piece
of
furniture
he
had
ever
known
its
contact
with
his
body
was
so
complete
that
it
pressed
nowhere
it
poked
nowhere
the
girl
studied
dials
in
its
back
nevertheless
and
muttered
something
about
adjusting
it
he
protested
nonsense
she
said
decisively
she
sat
down
herself
in
an
ordinary
seat
charles
shifted
uneasily
in
his
chair
to
find
that
it
moved
with
him
still
no
pressure
still
no
poking
you
wondering
she
began
about
the
word
it
has
a
bad
history
and
people
have
given
it
up
as
a
bad
job
it
true
that
there
is
pressure
nowadays
to
study
the
human
mind
people
get
along
in
general
what
they
want
they
get
without
crippling
effort
in
your
uncle
frank
taylor
language
the
syndic
is
an
organization
of
high
morale
and
wide
public
acceptance
in
my
language
the
syndic
is
a
which
does
a
good
job
of
fathering
in
good
times
people
are
introspective
there
is
literally
no
reason
why
my
line
of
the
family
should
have
kept
up
a
tradition
of
experimental
psychology
way
way
back
old
amadeo
falcaro
often
consulted
professor
oscar
sternweiss
of
the
columbia
university
psychology
faculty
he
was
as
much
of
a
dashing
improvisor
as
the
history
books
make
him
out
to
be
eventually
one
of
his
daughters
married
one
of
sternweiss
sons
and
inherited
the
sternweiss
notebooks
and
library
and
apparatus
it
became
an
irrational
custom
to
keep
it
alive
when
each
academic
school
of
psychology
managed
to
prove
that
every
other
school
of
psychology
was
dead
wrong
and
psychology
collapsed
as
a
science
the
family
tradition
was
unaffected
it
stood
outside
the
wrangling
now
you
wondering
what
this
has
to
do
with
trying
to
slip
you
into
the
government
i
am
charles
said
fervently
if
she
been
a
doll
outside
the
syndic
he
would
minutes
ago
have
protested
that
all
this
was
foolish
and
walked
out
since
she
was
not
only
in
the
syndic
but
in
the
falcaro
line
he
had
no
choice
except
to
hear
her
babble
and
walk
out
it
was
all
rot
psychology
id
oversoul
counseling
psychosomatics
rot
from
old
men
everybody
knew
the
government
we
know
uses
deinhibiting
drugs
as
a
first
screening
of
its
recruits
as
an
infallible
second
screening
they
use
a
physiological
based
on
the
fact
that
telling
a
lie
causes
tensions
in
the
liar
body
we
shall
get
around
this
by
slipping
you
in
as
a
young
man
who
hates
the
syndic
for
some
valid
reason
confound
it
you
were
just
telling
me
that
they
ca
be
fooled
we
wo

tear
down

gray
cell
at
a

we
pump
you
full
of
seconal
every
day
for
a
quarter
of
a
year
we
obliterate
your
personality
under
a
new
one
we
bury
charles
orsino
under
a
mountain
of
suggestions
compulsions
and
obsessions
shoveled
at
you
sixteen
hours
a
day
while
you
too
groggy
to
resist
naturally
the
supplanting
personality
will
be
neurotic
but
that
works
in
with
the
mission
he
struggled
with
a
metaphysical
concept
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
but
but
how
will
i
know
i
we
think
we
can
put
a
trigger
on
it
when
you
take
the
government
oath
of
allegiance
you
should
bounce
back
he
did
not
fail
to
note
a
little
twin
groove
between
her
brows
that
appeared
when
she
said
and
he
knew
that
in
a
sense
he
was
nearer
death
now
than
when
halloran
bullet
had
been
intercepted
are
you
staying
with
it
she
asked
simply
various
factors
entered
into
it
life
for
the
as
in
the
children
history
books
that
one
did
loom
very
large
but
multiply
it
by
sounds
like
more
fun
than
and
that
by
is
going
to
raise
my
stock
with
the
and
you
had
something
somehow
under
lee
falcaro
interested
gaze
he
neglected
to
divide
it
by
it
i
staying
with
it
he
said
she
grinned
it

onto

were

doing

after
instinctively
evaluating
the
roll
of

the
ricochet
of
bullets
the
probable
tactics
and
strategy
of
the
opposing
four
they
were
not
geared
to
a
human
being
who
behaved
with
the
blind
ferocity
of
an
inanimate
object
he
just
gawked
at
him
from
the
deck
noting
that
the
man
had
one
hand
on
a
sheath
knife
all
right
buster
the
man
said
contemptuously
apparently
deciding
that
orsino
would
stay
put
just
do
mess
with
the
guard
he
rolled
into
the
bunk
and
gave
a
good
imitation
of
a
man
asleep
until
orsino
worked
his
way
through
the
crowded
compartment
and
up
a
ladder
to
the
deck
there
was
a
heavy
gray
the
submarine
seemed
to
be
planing

washed
the

was
forward
drilling
with
a
the
rasp
of
a
singing
out
the
numbers
mingled
with
the
hiss
and
gurgle
of
the
spray
orsino
leaned
against
the
conning
tower
and
tried
to
comb
his
thoughts
out
clean
and
straight
it
was
easy
he
was
charles
orsino
very
junior
syndic
member
with
all
memories
pertaining
thereto
he
was
also
more
dimly
max
wyman
with

now
able
to
stand

of
wyman
he
could
recall
how
those
memories
had
been
implanted
down
to
the
last
stab
of
the
last
needle
he
thought
some
very
bitter
thoughts
about
lee
falcaro
and
dropped
them
snapping
to
attention
as
commander
grinnel
pulled
himself
through
the
hatch
good
morning
sir
he
said
the
cold
eyes
drilled
him
rest
the
commander
said
we
do
play
it
that
way
on
a
pigboat
i
hear
you
had
some
trouble
about
your
bunk
orsino
shrugged
uncomfortably
somebody
should
have
told
you
the
commander
said
the
boat
full
of
guardsmen
they
have
a
very
high
opinion
of
themselves
which
is
correct
they
carried
off
the
raid
in
good
style
you
do
mess
with
guards
what
are
they
orsino
asked
grinnel
shrugged
the
usual
elite
he
said
loman
gang
he
noted
orsino
blank
look
and
smiled
coldly
loman
president
of
north
america
he
said
on
shore
orsino
hazarded
we
used
to
hear
about
somebody
named
ben
miller
obsolete
information
miller
had
the
marines
behind
him
loman
was
secretary
of
defense
he
beached
the
marines
and
broke
them
up
into
guard
detachments
took
away
their
heavy
weapons
meanwhile
he
built
up
the
guard
very
quietly
which
with
the
secretary
of
information
behind
him
he
could
do
about
two
years
ago
he
struck
the
marines
who
join
the
guard
were
massacred
miller
had
the
sense
to
kill
himself
the
veep
and
the
secretary
of
state
resigned
but
it
did
save
their
necks
loman
assumed
the
presidency
automatically
of
course
and
had
them
shot
they
were
corrupt
as
hell
anyway
they
were
owned
body
and
soul
by
the
southern
bloc
two
seamen
appeared
with
a
folding
cot
followed
by
the
sub
commander
he
was
with
lack
of
sleep
set
it
there
he
told
them
and
sat
heavily
on
the
sagging
canvas
morning
grinnel
he
said
with
an
effort
believe
i
getting
too
old
for
the
pigboats
i
want
sun
and
air
think
you
can
use
your
influence
at
court
to
get
me
a
corvette
he
bared
his
teeth
to
show
it
was
a
joke
grinnel
said
with
a
minimum
smile
if
i
had
any
influence
would
i
catch
the
crap
they
sling
at
me
the
sub
commander
rolled
back
onto
the
cot
and
was
instantly
asleep
a
muscle
twitching
the
left
side
of
his
face
every
few
seconds
grinnel
drew
orsino
to
the
lee
of
the
conning
tower
we
let
him
sleep
he
said
go
tell
that
gun
crew
commander
grinnel
says
they
should
lay
below
orsino
did
the
petty
officer
said
something
exasperated
about
the
gunnery
training
bill
and
orsino
repeated
his
piece
they
secured
the
gun
and
went
below
grinnel
said
with
apparent
irrelevance
you
a
rare
bird
wyman
you
capable
and
you
uncommitted
let
go
below
stick
with
me
he
followed
the
fat
little
commander
into
the
conning
tower
grinnel
told
an
officer
of
some
sort
i
take
the
con
mister
wyman
here
will
take
the
radar
watch
he
gave
orsino
a
look
that
choked
off
his
protests
presumably
grinnel
knew
that
he
was
ignorant
of
radar
the
officer
looking
baffled
said
yes
commander
a
seaman
pulled
his
head
out
of
a
box
and
told
wyman
it
all
yours
stranger
wyman
cautiously
put
his
face
into
the
box
and
was
confronted
by
meaningless
blobs
of
green
numerals
in
the
dark
and
a
couple
of
arrows
to
make
confusion
complete
he
heard
grinnel
say
to
the
helmsman
get
me
a
mug
of
joe
sailor
take
the
wheel
i
pass
the
word
sir
nuts
you
pass
the
word
sailor
go
get
the
coffee
and
i
want
it
now
and
not
when
some
steward
mate
decides
he
ready
to
bring
it
aye
aye
sir
orsino
heard
him
clatter
down
the
ladder
then
his
arm
was
gripped
and
grinnel
voice
muttered
in
his
ear
when
you
hear
me
bitch
about
the
coffee
sing
out
dx
good
and
loud
no
do
stop
looking
repeat
it
orsino
said
his
eyes
crossing
on
double
images
of
the
meaningless
luminous
blobs
aircraft
dx
good
and
loud
when
you
bitch
about
the
coffee
right
do
forget
it
he
heard
the
feet
on
the
ladder
again
coffee
sir
thanks
sailor
a
long
sip
and
then
another
i
always
said
the
pigboats
drink
the
lousiest
joe
in
the
navy
aircraft
dx
orsino
yelled
a
thunderous
alarm
began
to
sound
take
her
down
yelled
commander
grinnel
take
her
down
sir
the
helmsman
echoed
but
sir
the
skipper
orsino
remembered
him
too
then
dead
asleep
in
his
cot
on
the
deck
the
muscle
twitching
the
left
side
of
his
face
every
few
seconds
it
those
were
aircraft
her
down
the
luminous
blobs
and
numbers
and
arrows
swirled
before
orsino
eyes
as
the
trim
of
the
ship
changed
hatches
clanged
to
and
water
thundered
into
the
ballast
tanks
he
staggered
and
caught
himself
as
the
deck
angled
sharply
underfoot
he
knew
what
grinnel
had
meant
by
saying
he
was
uncommitted
and
he
knew
now
that
it
was
no
longer
true
he
thought
for
a
moment
that
he
might
be
sick
into
the
box
but
it
passed
minutes
later
grinnel
was
on
the
mike
his
voice
sounding
metallically
through
the
ship
to
all
hands
to
all
hands
this
is
commander
grinnel
we
lost
the
skipper
in
that
emergency
dive
but
you
and
i
know
that
that
the
way
he
would
have
wanted
it
as
senior
line
officer
aboard
i
assuming
command
for
the
rest
of
the
voyage
we
will
remain
submerged
until
dark
division
officers
report
to
the
wardroom
all
he
tapped
orsino
on
the
shoulder
take
off
he
said
orsino
realized
that
the
green
blobs
clouds
were
they
no
longer
showed
and
recalled
that
radar
did
work
through
water
he
was
in
on
the
wardroom
meeting
and
wandered
rather
forlornly
through
the
ship
incredibly
jammed
as
it
was
with
sleeping
men
men
and
booty
half
a
dozen
times
he
had
to
turn
away
close
questioning
about
his
radar
experience
and
the
appearance
of
the
aircraft
on
the
radar
scope
each
time
he
managed
it
with
the
feeling
that
one
more
question
would
have
cooked
his
goose
the
men
were
sentimental
about
the
skipper
they
had
lost
mostly
they
wondered
how
much
of
a
cut
grinnel
would
allot
them
from
the
booty
of
cape
cod
at
last
the
word
passed
for
wyman
to
report
to
the
captain
cabin
he
did
sweating
after
a
chat
with
a
radar
technician
grinnel
closed
the
door
of
the
minute
cabin
and
smirked
at
him
you
have
trouble
wyman
he
asked
yes
you
have
worse
trouble
if
they
found
out
for
sure
that
you
do
know
radar
i
be
in
the
clear
i
could
tell
them
you
claimed
to
be
a
qualified
radar
man
that
would
make
me
out
to
be
pretty
gullible
but
it
would
make
you
out
to
be
a
murderer
who
backing
you
wyman
who
told
you
to
get
rid
of
the
skipper
quite
right
sir
orsino
said
you
really
got
me
there
glad
you
realize
it
wyman
i
got
you
and
i
can
use
you
it
was
a
great
bit
of
luck
the
skipper
corking
off
on
deck
but
i
always
had
a
talent
for
improvisation
if
you
determined
to
be
a
leader
wyman
nothing
is
more
valuable
do
you
know
i
can
relax
with
you
it
a
rare
feeling
for
once
i
can
be
certain
that
the
man
i
talking
to
is
one
of
loman
stooges
or
one
of
clinch
ferrets
or
anything
else
but
what
he
says
he
is
but
that
beside
the
point
i
have
something
else
to
tell
you
there
are
two
sides
to
working
for
me
wyman
one
of
them
punishment
if
you
get
off
the
track
that
been
made
clear
to
you
the
other
is
reward
if
you
stay
on
i
have
plans
wyman
that
are
they
simply
eclipse
the
wildest
hopes
of
loman
clinch
baggot
and
the
rest
and
yet
they
not
wild
how
you
like
to
be
on
the
inside
when
the
north
american
government
returns
to
the
mainland
orsino
uttered
an
authentic
gasp
and
commander
grinnel
looked
satisfied
ix
the
submarine
docked
at
an
indescribably
lovely
bay
in
the
south
of
ireland
orsino
asked
grinnel
whether
the
irish
did
object
to
this
and
was
met
with
a
blank
stare
it
developed
that
the
irish
consisted
of
a
few
hundred
wild
men
in
the
woods
maybe
a
few
thousand
the
stupid
personnel
could
seem
to
clean
them
out
grinnel
know
anything
about
them
and
he
cared
less
ireland
appeared
to
be
the
naval
base
the
government
proper
was
located
on
iceland
vernal
again
after
a
long
climatic
swing
the
canaries
and
ascencion
were
outposts
orsino
had
learned
enough
on
the
voyage
to
recognize
the
government
for
what
it
was
it
had
happened
before
in
history
uncle
frank
had
pointed
it
out
caribbean
piracy
had
grown
from
very
respectable
origins
had
been
granted
letters
of
marque
and
reprisal
by
warring
governments
which
made
them
a
sort
of
contract
navy
periods
of
peace
had
found
these
privateers
unwilling
to
give
up
their
hard
earned
complicated
profession
and
their
investments
in
it
when
they
could
no
longer
hoist
the
flag
of
england
or
france
or
spain
they
simply
hoisted
the
jolly
roger
and
went
it
alone
confusing
hell
yes
the
famous
captain
kidd
thought
he
was
a
gallant
privateer
and
sailed
trustingly
into
new
york
somewhere
he
had
failed
to
touch
third
base
they
shipped
him
to
london
for
trial
and
hanged
him
as
a
pirate
the
famous
henry
morgan
had
never
been
anything
but
a
pirate
and
a
as
admiral
of
a
private
fleet
he
executed
a
brilliant
amphibious
operation
and
sacked
the
city
of
panama
he
was
knighted
made
governor
of
a
english
island
in
the
west
indies
and
died
loved
and
respected
by
all
charles
orsino
found
himself
a
member
of
a
pirate
band
that
called
itself
the
north
american
government
more
difficult
to
learn
were
the
ins
and
outs
of
pirate
politics
which
were
hampered
with
an
archaic
nomenclature
and
body
of
tradition
commander
grinnel
was
a
sociocrat
which
meant
that
he
was
in
the
same
gang
as
president
loman
the
late
sub
commander
had
been
a
constitutionist
which
meant
that
he
was
allied
with
the
southern
bloc
the
southern
bloc
did
not
consist
of
southerners
at
this
stage
of
the
north
american
government
history
but
of
a
clique
that
tended
to
include
the
engineers
and
maintenance
men
of
the
government
that
had
been
the
reason
for
the
sub
erasure
the
constitutionists
traditionally
commanded
pigboats
and
aircraft
while
surface
vessels
and
the
shore
establishments
were
in
the
hands
of
the
sociocrats
the
fruit
of
some
compromise
commander
grinnel
cheerfully
explained
to
charles
that
there
was
a
naval
officer
primed
and
waiting
to
be
appointed
to
the
command
of
the
sub
the
constitutionist
gang
would
back
him
to
the
hilt
and
the
sociocrats
would
growl
and
finally
assent
if
thereafter
the
constitutionists
ever
counted
on
the
sub
in
a
coup
they
would
be
quickly
disillusioned
there
was
much
voting
forty
years
before
there
had
been
a
bad
deadlock
following
the
death
by
natural
causes
of
president
powell
after
seventeen
years
in
office
an
ad
hoc
bipartisan
conference
called
a
session
of
the
senate
and
the
senate
elected
a
new
president
it
was
little
information
to
be
equipped
with
when
you
walked
out
into
the
brawling
streets
of
new
portsmouth
on
shore
leave
the
town
had
an
improvised
look
which
was
strange
to
orsino
there
was
a
sanitation
reactor
every
hundred
yards
or
so
but
he
mistrusted
the
look
of
the
mains
that
led
to
it
from
the
houses
there
were
house
flies
from
which
he
shied
violently
every
other
shack
on
the
waterfront
was
a
bar
or
a
notch
joint
he
sampled
the
goods
at
one
of
the
former
and
was
shocked
by
the
quality
and
price
he
rolled
out
his
ears
still
ringing
from
the
belt
of
raw
booze
as
half
a
dozen
sweatered
guards
rolled
in
singing
some
esoteric
song
about
their
high
morale
and
even
higher
venereal
rate
a
couple
of
them
looked
at
him
appraisingly
as
though
they
wondered
what
kind
of
a
noise
he
make
if
they
jumped
on
his
stomach
real
hard
and
he
hurried
away
from
them
the
other
entertainment
facilities
of
the
waterfront
were
flatly
ruled
out
by
a
quick
inspection
of
the
wares
he
did
know
what
to
make
of
them
joints
back
in
syndic
territory
if
you
were
a
man
made
sense
you
went
to
learn
the
ropes
or
because
you
were
afraid
of
getting
mixed
up
in
something
intense
when
you
did
want
to
or
because
you
wanted
a
change
or
because
you
were
too
busy
lazy
or
shy
to
chase
skirts
on
your
own
if
you
were
a
woman
and
not
too
particular
a
couple
of
years
in
a
joint
left
you
with
a
considerable
amount
of
money
and
some
interesting
memories
which
you
were
under
no
obligation
to
discuss
with
your
husbands
or
husband
but
the
sloppy
beasts
who
called
to
him
from
the
windows
of
the
joints
here
on
the
waterfront
left
him
puzzled
and
disgusted
he
reflected
strolling
up
washington
street
with
eyes
straight
ahead
that
women
must
be
in
short
supply
if
they
could
make
a
living
or
that
the
male
citizens
of
the
government
had
no
taste
a
whiff
from
one
of
those
questionable
sewer
mains
sent
him
reeling
he
ducked
into
another
saloon
in
and
leaned
groggily
against
the
bar
a
pretty
brunette
demanded
what
you
have
gin
please
he
peeled
a
ten
off
the
roll
grinnel
had
given
him
when
the
girl
poured
his
gin
he
looked
at
her
and
found
her
fair
in
all
innocence
he
asked
her
a
question
as
he
might
have
asked
a
barmaid
back
home
she
could
have
answered
yes
no
maybe
or
what
in
it
for
me
instead
she
called
him
a
lousy
bastard
picked
up
a
beer
mug
and
was
about
to
shatter
it
on
his
head
when
a
hand
caught
her
and
a
voice
warned
hold
it
mabel
this
guy
off
my
ship
he
just
out
of
the
states
he
does
know
any
better
you
know
what
it
like
over
there
mabel
snarled
you
better
wise
him
up
then
friend
he
ca
go
around
talking
like
that
to
decent
women
she
slapped
down
another
glass
poured
gin
and
flounced
down
the
bar
charles
gulped
his
gin
and
turned
shakily
to
his
deliverer
a
little
reactor
specialist
he
had
seen
on
the
sub
once
or
twice
thanks
he
said
feeling
inadequate
maybe
you
better
wise
me
up
all
i
said
was
do
you
the
reactor
man
held
up
his
hand
that
enough
he
said
you
talk
that
way
over
here
unless
you
want
your
scalp
parted
charles
buzzing
a
little
with
the
gin
protested
hotly
but
what
the
harm
all
she
had
to
say
was
no
i
was
going
to
throw
her
down
on
the
floor
it
was
all
very
confusing
a
shrug
i
heard
about
things
in
the
states
wyman
is
it
i
guess
i
did
really
believe
it
you
mean
i
could
go
up
to
any
woman
and
just
ask
her
how
about
it
within
reason
yes
and
they
some
do
some
do
like
here
like
hell
like
here
last
liberty
and
the
reactor
man
told
him
a
long
confusing
story
about
how
he
had
picked
up
this
pig
how
she
had
dangled
it
in
front
of
him
for
one
solid
week
while
he
managed
to
spend
three
hundred
and
dollars
on
her
and
how
finally
she
had
bawled
that
she
could
she
just
hated
herself
but
she
could
do
anything
like
and
bang
went
the
door
in
his
face
leaving
him
to
finish
out
the
evening
in
a
notch
joint
good
god
charles
said
appalled
was
she
out
of
her
mind
no
the
reactor
man
said
glumly
but
i
must
have
been
i
should
of
got
her
drunk
and
raped
her
the
first
night
charles
was
fully
conscious
that
values
were
different
here
choking
down
something
like
nausea
he
asked
carefully
is
there
much
rape
the
little
man
signalled
for
another
gin
and
downed
it
i
guess
so
once
when
i
was
a
kid
a
dame
gave
me
this
line
about
her
cousin
raped
her
when
she
was
little
so
she
was
frigid
i
had
more
ambition
then
so
i
said
this
wo
be
anything
new
to
you
baby
i
popped
her
on
the
button
i
got
to
go
now
charles
said
walking
straight
out
of
the
saloon
he
was
beginning
to
understand
the
sloppy
beasts
in
the
windows
of
the
notch
joint
and
why
men
could
bring
themselves
to
settle
for
nothing
better
he
was
also
overwhelmed
by
a
great
wave
of
home
sickness
the
ugly
pattern
was
beginning
to
emerge
prudery
rape
frigidity
intrigue
for
power
and
assassination
beyond
the
one
hint
grinnel
had
said
nothing
that
affected
syndic
territory
but
nothing
would
be
more
logical
than
for
this
band
of
brigands
to
lust
after
the
riches
of
the
continent
back
of
the
waterfront
were
shipfitting
shops
and
living
quarters
work
was
being
done
by
a
puzzling
combination
of
mechanization
and
musclepower
in
one
open
shed
he
saw
a
turning
a
gunbarrel
out
of
a
forging
the
lathe
was
driven
by
one
of
those
standard
ehrenhaft
rotors
max
wyman
knew
so
well
but
a
vertical
drillpress
next
to
it
orsino
blinked
two
men
sweating
and
panting
were
turning
a
stubborn
vertical
drum
as
tall
as
they
were
and
a
belt
drive
from
the
drum
whirled
the
drill
bit
as
it
sank
into
a
hunk
of
bronze
the
men
were
in
rags
dirty
rags
and
it
came
to
orsino
with
a
stunning
shock
when
he
realized
what
the
dull
clanking
things
were
that
swung
from
their
wrists
they
were
chained
to
the
handles
of
the
wheel
he
walked
on
almost
dazed
comprehending
now
some
cryptic
remarks
that
had
been
passed
aboard
the
sub
no
frog
has
staying
power
give
a
limey
his
beef
once
a
day
and
outsweat
a
frog
yeah
but
you
ca
whip
a
limey
they
just
go
bad
when
you
whip
a
limey
they
just
get
sullen
for
awhile
but
let
me
tell
you
friend
ever
whip
a
spig
you
whip
a
spig
he
wait
twenty
years
if
he
has
to
but
he
you
right
between
the
ribs
if
a
spig
wants
to
be
boiled
i
should
worry
it
had
been
broken
up
in
laughter
could
such
things
be
sixteen
ragged
were
creeping
down
the
road
each
straining
at
a
rope
an
inch
at
a
time
they
were
dragging
a
skid
loaded
with
one
huge
turbine
gear
whose
tiny
herringbone
teeth
caught
the
afternoon
sun
the
government
had
reactors
the
government
had
vehicles
why
this
he
slowly
realized
that
the
government
metal
and
machinery
and
atomic
power
went
into
its
warships
that
there
was
none
left
over
for
consumers
and
the
uses
of
peace
the
government
had
degenerated
into
a
monster
specialized
all
to
teeth
and
claws
and
muscles
to
drive
them
with
the
government
was
now
whatever
it
had
been
a
graceless
humorless
incarnate
ferocity
whatever
lightness
or
joy
survived
was
the
meaningless
vestigial
twitching
of
an
obsolete
organ
somewhere
a
child
began
to
bawl
and
charles
was
surprised
to
feel
a
profound
pity
welling
up
in
him
like
a
sedentary
man
who
after
a
workout
aches
in
muscles
he
never
knew
he
owned
charles
was
discovering
that
he
had
emotions
which
had
never
been
poignantly
evoked
by
the
bland
passage
of
the
hours
in
syndic
territory
poor
little
bastard
he
thought
growing
up
in
this
hellhole
i
know
what
having
slaves
to
kick
around
will
do
to
you
but
i
do
see
how
you
can
grow
up
a
human
being
i
do
know
what
fear
of
love
will
do
to
you
make
you
a
cheat
or
a
graceful
rutting
animal
with
a
choice
only
between
graceless
rutting
violence
and
a
stinking
scuffle
with
a
flabby
and
abstracted
stranger
in
a
strange
unloved
room
we
have
our
guns
to
play
with
and
they
good
toys
but
i
do
know
what
kind
of
monster
you
become
when
they
give
you
a
gun
to
live
with
and
violence
for
a
god
was
he
thought
unhappily
got
to
do
something
about
this
a
man
and
a
woman
were
struggling
in
an
alley
as
he
passed
old
habit
almost
made
him
walk
on
but
this
was
the
playful
business
of
ripping
clothes
as
practiced
during
hilarious
moments
in
mob
territory
it
was
a
grim
and
silent
struggle
the
man
wore
the
sweater
of
the
guards
nevertheless
charles
walked
into
the
alley
and
tore
him
away
from
the
woman
or
rather
he
yanked
at
the
man
arm
and
the
man
in
surprise
let
go
of
the
woman
and
spun
to
face
him
beat
it
charles
said
to
the
woman
not
looking
around
he
saw
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
that
she
was
staying
right
there
the
man
hand
was
on
his
sheath
knife
he
told
charles
get
lost
now
you
do
mess
with
the
guards
charles
felt
his
knees
quivering
which
was
good
he
knew
from
many
a
chukker
of
polo
that
it
meant
that
he
was
strung
to
the
breaking
point
ready
to
explode
into
action
pull
that
knife
he
said
and
the
next
thing
you
know
you
be
eating
it
the
man
face
went
dead
calm
and
he
pulled
the
knife
and
came
in
low
very
fast
the
knife
was
supposed
to
catch
charles
in
the
middle
if
charles
stepped
inside
it
the
man
would
grab
him
in
a
bear
hug
and
knife
him
in
the
back
there
was
only
one
answer
he
caught
the
thick
wrist
from
above
with
his
left
hand
as
the
knife
flashed
toward
his
middle
and
shoved
out
he
felt
the
point
catch
and
slice
his
cuff
the
guardsman
tried
a
furious
and
kick
at
his
crotch
with
his
grip
on
the
charles
toppled
him
into
the
filthy
alley
as
he
stood
and
off
balance
he
fell
on
his
back
floundering
and
for
a
black
moment
charles
thought
his
weight
was
about
to
tear
the
wrist
loose
from
his
grip
the
moment
passed
and
charles
put
his
right
foot
in
the
socket
of
the
guardsman
elbow
reinforced
his
tiring
left
hand
with
his
right
and
leaned
doubling
the
man
forearm
over
the
fulcrum
of
his
boot
the
man
roared
and
dropped
the
knife
it
had
taken
perhaps
five
seconds
charles
said
panting
i
do
want
to
break
your
arm
or
kick
your
head
in
or
anything
like
that
i
just
want
you
to
go
away
and
leave
the
woman
alone
he
was
conscious
of
her
vaguely
hovering
in
the
background
he
thought
angrily
might
at
least
get
his
the
guardsman
said
thickly
you
give
me
the
boot
and
i
swear
to
god
i
find
you
and
cut
you
to
ribbons
if
it
takes
me
the
rest
of
my
life
charles
thought
he
can
tell
himself
he
scared
me
he
let
go
of
the
forearm
straightened
and
took
his
foot
from
the
elbow
stepping
back
the
guardsman
got
up
stiffly
flexing
his
arm
and
stooped
to
pick
up
and
sheath
his
knife
without
taking
his
eyes
off
charles
then
he
spat
in
the
dust
at
charles
feet
yellow
crud
he
said
if
the
goddam
crow
was
worth
it
i
cut
your
heart
out
he
walked
off
down
the
alley
and
charles
followed
him
with
his
eyes
until
he
turned
the
corner
into
the
street
then
he
turned
irritated
that
the
woman
had
not
spoken
she
was
lee
falcaro
lee
he
said
thunderstruck
what
are
you
doing
here
it
was
the
same
face
feature
for
feature
and
between
her
brows
appeared
the
same
double
groove
he
had
seen
before
but
she
did
know
him
you
know
me
she
asked
blankly
is
that
why
you
pulled
that
ape
off
me
i
ought
to
thank
you
but
i
ca
place
you
at
all
i
do
know
many
people
here
i
been
ill
you
know
there
was
a
difference
apparent
now
the
voice
was
a
little
querulous
and
charles
would
have
staked
his
life
that
never
could
lee
falcaro
have
said
in
that
slightly
smug
slightly
proprietary
slightly
tone
i
been
ill
you
know
but
what
are
you
here
damn
it
do
you
know
me
i
charles
orsino
he
realized
then
that
he
had
made
a
horrible
mistake
orsino
she
said
and
then
she
spat
of
the
there
was
black
hatred
in
her
eyes
she
turned
and
raced
down
the
alley
he
stood
there
stupidly
for
almost
a
minute
and
then
ran
after
her
as
far
as
the
alley
mouth
she
was
gone
you
could
run
almost
anywhere
in
new
portsmouth
in
almost
a
minute
a
weedy
little
seaman
wearing
crossed
quills
on
his
cap
was
lounging
against
a
building
he
snickered
at
charles
do
chase
that
one
sailor
he
said
she
is
the
property
of
you
know
who
she
is
the
yeoman
happily
spilled
his
inside
dope
to
the
fleet
gob
lee
bennet
smuggled
over
here
couple
months
ago
by
the
hottest
thing
that
ever
hit
naval
intelligence
very
small
potato
in
the
syndic
knows
all
the
families
who
does
what
who
a
figurehead
and
who
a
worker
terrific
inside
stuff
hates
the
syndic
a
gang
of
did
her
dirt
thanks
charles
said
and
wandered
off
down
the
street
it
was
surprising
he
should
have
it
pride
of
the
falcaro
line
she
would
send
anybody
into
deadly
peril
unless
she
were
ready
to
go
herself
only
somehow
the
trigger
that
would
have
snapped
neurotic
synthetic
lee
bennet
into
lee
falcaro
had
worked
he
wandered
on
aimlessly
wondering
whether
it
would
be
minutes
or
hours
before
he
be
picked
up
and
executed
as
a
spy
part
ii
x
it
took
minutes
only
he
had
headed
back
to
the
waterfront
afraid
to
run
with
some
vague
notion
of
stealing
a
boat
before
he
reached
the
row
of
saloons
and
joints
a
squad
of
eight
tall
men
overtook
him
hold
it
mister
a
sergeant
said
are
you
orsino
no
he
said
hopelessly
that
crazy
woman
began
to
yell
at
me
that
i
was
orsino
but
my
name
wyman
what
this
about
the
other
men
fell
in
beside
and
behind
him
we
stepping
over
to
the
sergeant
said
there
the
son
of
a
bitch
somebody
bawled
suddenly
there
were
a
dozen
sweatered
guardsmen
around
them
their
leader
was
the
thug
orsino
had
beaten
in
a
fair
fight
he
said
silkily
to
the
sergeant
we
want
that
boy
leatherneck
blow
the
sergeant
went
pale
he
wanted
for
questioning
by
the
he
said
stolidly
get
the
marine
the
guardsman
chortled
he
stuck
his
jaw
into
the
sergeant
face
tell
your
squad
to
blow
you
marines
ought
to
know
by
now
that
you
do
mess
with
the
guard
a
very
junior
officer
appeared
what
going
on
here
you
men
he
shrilled
he
was
ignored
as
guardsman
and
marines
measured
one
another
with
their
eyes
i
said
dammit
sergeant
there
was
no
reaction
the
officer
yelled
you
men
may
think
you
can
get
away
with
this
but
by
god
you
wrong
he
strode
away
his
fists
clenched
and
his
face
very
red
orsino
saw
him
stride
through
a
gate
into
a
lot
marked
motor
and
he
felt
a
sudden
wave
of
communal
understanding
that
there
were
only
seconds
to
go
the
sergeant
played
for
time
i
be
glad
to
surrender
the
prisoner
he
started
if
you
have
anything
to
show
in
the
way
of
the
guardsman
kicked
for
the
pit
of
the
sergeant
stomach
he
was
a
sucker
orsino
thought
abstractedly
as
he
saw
the
sergeant
catch
his
foot
dump
him
and
pivot
to
block
another
guardsman
then
he
was
fighting
for
his
life
himself
against
three
bellowing
guardsmen
a
ripping
hammering
noise
filled
the
air
suddenly
like
cold
magic
it
froze
the
milling
mob
where
it
stood
noise
the
jaygee
was
back
this
time
in
a
jeep
with
a
twin
fifty
and
he
was
glaring
down
its
barrels
into
the
crowd
people
were
beginning
to
stream
from
the
saloons
joints
and
shipfitting
shops
the
jaygee
cocked
his
cap
rakishly
over
one
eye
in
he
rasped
and
a
haunting
air
of
familiarity
came
over
orsino
the
waiting
jeep
almost
bucking
in
its
eagerness
to
be
let
loose
orsino
on
the
ground
knees
trembling
with
tension
a
perfect
change
of
mount
scene
in
a
polo
match
he
reacted
automatically
there
was
a
surrealist
flash
of
the
jaygee
face
before
he
clipped
him
into
the
back
of
the
square
little
truck
there
was
another
flash
of
spectators
scrambling
as
he
roared
the
jeep
down
the
road
from
then
on
it
was
just
a
question
of
hanging
onto
the
wheel
with
one
hand
trying
to
secure
the
with
the
other
glancing
back
to
see
if
the
jaygee
was
still
out
avoiding
yapping
dogs
and
pedestrians
staying
on
the
rutted
road
pushing
all
possible
speed
out
of
the
jeep
noting
landmarks
estimating
the
possibility
of
dangerous
pursuit
for
a
polo
player
a
dull
little
practice
session
the
road
such
as
it
was
wound
five
miles
inland
through
scrubby
woodland
and
terminated
at
a
lumber
camp
where
chained
men
in
rags
were
dragging
logs
orsino
back
tracked
a
from
the
camp
and
jolted
overland
in
a
hare
and
hounds
course
at
fifty
per
the
jeep
took
it
for
an
hour
in
the
fading
afternoon
light
and
then
bucked
to
a
halt
orsino
turned
for
an
overdue
check
on
the
jaygee
and
found
him
conscious
but
greenly
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
vehicle
but
he
saw
orsino
staring
and
gamely
struggled
to
his
feet
standing
in
the
truck
bed
you
under
arrest
sailor
he
said
striking
an
officer
abuse
of
government
property
driving
a
government
vehicle
without
a
his
legs
betrayed
him
and
he
sat
down
hard
orsino
thought
very
briefly
of
letting
him
have
a
burst
from
the
and
abandoned
the
idea
he
seemed
to
have
bitched
up
everything
so
far
but
he
was
still
on
a
mission
he
had
a
commissioned
officer
of
the
government
approximately
in
his
power
he
snapped
nonsense
under
arrest
the
jaygee
seemed
to
be
reviewing
rapidly
any
transgressions
he
may
have
committed
and
asked
at
last
cautiously
by
what
authority
i
represent
the
syndic
it
was
a
the
jaygee
stammered
but
you
ca
but
there
is
any
way
but
how
never
mind
how
you
crazy
you
must
be
or
you
would
stop
here
i
do
believe
you
from
the
continent
and
i
do
believe
the
jeep
broken
down
he
was
beginning
to
sound
just
a
little
hysterical
it
ca
break
down
here
we
must
be
more
than
thirty
miles
inland
what
special
about
thirty
miles
inland
the
natives
you
fool
the
natives
again
i
not
worried
about
natives
not
with
a
pair
of
fifties
you
do
understand
the
jaygee
said
forcing
calm
into
his
voice
this
is
the
outback
they
in
charge
here
we
ca
do
a
thing
with
them
they
jump
people
in
the
dark
and
skewer
them
now
fix
this
damn
jeep
and
let
get
rolling
into
a
firing
squad
do
be
silly
lieutenant
i
presume
you
slug
me
while
i
check
the
engine
the
jaygee
was
looking
around
him
my
god
no
he
said
you
may
be
a
gangster
but
he
trailed
off
orsino
stiffened
gangster
was
talk
listen
pirate
he
said
nastily
i
do
believe
the
jaygee
roared
indignantly
and
then
shut
his
mouth
with
a
click
looking
apprehensively
about
the
gesture
was
faked
it
alarmed
orsino
tell
me
about
your
wildmen
he
said
go
to
hell
the
jaygee
said
sulkily
look
you
called
me
a
gangster
first
what
about
these
natives
you
were
trying
to
trick
me
were
you
kiss
my
royal
north
american
eyeball
gangster
do
be
childish
charles
reproved
him
feeling
adult
and
superior
the
jaygee
looked
a
couple
of
years
younger
than
he
he
climbed
out
of
his
seat
and
lifted
the
hood
the
damage
was
trivial
a
shear
pin
in
the
transmission
had
given
way
he
reported
mournfully
cracked
block
the
jeep
through
forever
you
can
get
on
your
way
lieutenant
i
wo
try
to
hold
you
the
jaygee
fumed
you
could
hold
me
if
you
wanted
to
gangster
if
you
think
i
going
to
try
and
hoof
back
to
the
base
alone
in
the
dark
you
crazy
we
sticking
together
two
of
us
may
be
able
to
hold
them
off
for
the
night
in
the
morning
we
see
well
maybe
the
officer
did
there
were
wildmen
in
the
woods
that
did
mean
there
the
jaygee
got
out
and
looked
under
the
hood
uncertainly
it
was
obvious
that
in
the
first
place
he
was
no
mechanic
and
in
the
second
place
he
could
conceive
of
anybody
voluntarily
risking
the
woods
rather
than
the
naval
base
he
said
dismount
that
gun
while
i
get
a
fire
started
yes
sir
charles
said
sardonically
saluting
the
jaygee
absently
returned
the
salute
and
began
to
collect
twigs
orsino
asked
how
do
these
aborigines
of
yours
operate
sneak
up
in
the
dark
they
have
spears
and
a
few
stolen
guns
usually
they
do
have
cartridges
for
them
but
you
ca
count
on
that
but
they
have
witches
orsino
snorted
he
was
getting
very
hungry
indeed
do
you
know
any
of
the
local
plants
we
might
eat
the
jaygee
said
confidently
i
guess
we
can
get
by
on
roots
until
morning
orsino
dubiously
pulled
up
a
shrub
dabbed
clods
off
its
root
and
tasted
it
it
tasted
exactly
like
a
root
he
sighed
and
changed
the
subject
what
do
we
do
with
the
fifties
when
i
get
them
both
off
the
mount
the
jeep
mount
breaks
down
some
damn
way
or
other
into
two
tripods
see
if
you
can
figure
it
out
while
i
get
the
fire
going
the
jaygee
had
a
small
smoky
fire
barely
going
in
twenty
minutes
orsino
was
still
struggling
with
the
jeep
gun
mount
it
came
apart
but
it
could
go
together
again
the
jaygee
strolled
over
at
last
contemptuously
to
lend
a
hand
he
could
make
it
work
either
two
lost
tempers
and
four
split
fingernails
later
it
developed
the
elevating
screw
really
held
the
two
front
legs
on
and
that
you
elevated
by
adjusting
the
rear
tripod
leg
a
hell
of
an
officer
you
are
orsino
sulked
it
began
to
rain
putting
the
fire
out
with
a
hiss
they
wound
up
prone
under
the
jeep
not
on
speaking
terms
each
tending
a
gun
each
presumably
responsible
for
degrees
of
perimeter
charles
was
fairly
dry
except
for
a
trickle
of
icy
water
following
a
contour
that
meandered
to
his
left
knee
after
an
hour
of
nothing
to
be
seen
and
only
the
patter
of
rain
he
heard
a
snore
and
kicked
the
jaygee
the
jaygee
cursed
wearily
and
said
i
guess
we
better
talk
to
keep
awake
not
having
any
trouble
pirate
oh
knock
it
off
where
do
you
get
that
pirate
bit
gangster
you
outlaws
are
you
like
hell
we
are
the
outlaws
you
rebelled
against
the
lawfully
constituted
north
american
government
just
because
you
won
for
the
time
being
does
mean
you
were
right
the
fact
that
we
won
does
mean
that
we
were
right
the
fact
that
your
government
lives
by
raiding
and
scavenging
off
us
means
you
were
wrong
god
the
things
i
seen
since
i
joined
up
with
you
thugs
i
bet
respect
for
the
home
sanctity
of
marriage
sexual
morality
law
and
order
you
never
saw
anything
like
that
back
home
did
you
gangster
he
looked
very
smug
orsino
clenched
his
teeth
somebody
been
telling
you
a
pack
of
lies
he
said
there
just
as
much
home
and
family
life
and
morality
and
order
back
in
syndic
territory
as
there
is
here
and
probably
a
lot
more
bull
i
seen
intelligence
reports
i
know
how
you
people
live
are
you
telling
me
you
do
have
sexual
promiscuity
polygamy
polyandry
open
gambling
uncontrolled
liquor
trade
corruption
and
shakedowns
orsino
squinted
along
the
barrel
of
the
gun
into
the
rain
look
he
said
take
me
as
an
average
young
man
from
syndic
territory
i
know
maybe
a
hundred
people
i
know
just
three
women
and
two
men
who
are
what
you
call
promiscuous
i
know
one
family
with
two
wives
and
one
husband
i
do
really
know
any
people
personally
who
go
in
for
polyandry
but
i
met
three
casually
and
the
rest
are
ordinary
couples
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
just
leaving
out
anybody
under
middle
age
when
you
talk
about
morality
naturally
charles
said
baffled
would
you
the
only
answer
was
a
snort
what
are
bupers
charles
asked
the
jaygee
said
distinctly
bureau
of
personnel
north
american
navy
what
do
you
do
there
what
a
personnel
bureau
do
the
jaygee
said
patiently
we
recruit
classify
assign
promote
and
train
personnel
paperwork
huh
no
wonder
you
do
know
how
to
shoot
or
drive
if
i
did
need
you
to
cover
my
back
i
shove
this
mg
down
your
silly
throat
for
your
information
gangster
all
officers
do
a
tour
of
duty
on
paperwork
before
they
assigned
to
their
permanent
branch
going
into
the
pigboats
why
family
my
father
commands
a
sub
he
captain
van
dellen
god
van
the
sub
commander
grinnel
and
he
had
murdered
the
kid
had
heard
yet
that
his
father
had
been
lost
in
an
emergency
dive
the
rain
ceased
to
fall
the
pattering
drizzle
gave
way
to
irregular
splashing
drops
from
leaves
and
branches
van
dellen
charles
said
there
something
you
ought
to
know
it
keep
the
jaygee
answered
in
a
grim
whisper
the
bolt
of
his
gun
clicked
i
hear
them
out
there
xi
she
felt
the
power
of
the
goddess
working
in
her
but
feebly
dark
so
dark
and
so
tired
how
old
was
she
more
than
eight
hundred
moons
had
waxed
and
waned
above
her
head
since
birth
and
she
had
run
at
the
head
of
her
spearmen
to
the
motor
sounds
a
motor
meant
the
smithymen
from
the
sea
and
you
killed
smithymen
when
you
could
she
let
out
a
short
shrill
chuckle
in
the
dark
there
was
a
rustling
of
branches
one
of
the
spearmen
had
turned
to
stare
at
the
sound
she
knew
his
face
was
worried
tend
to
business
you
fool
she
wheezed
or
by
bridget
his
breath
went
in
with
a
hiss
and
she
chuckled
again
you
had
to
let
them
know
who
was
the
cook
and
who
was
the
potatoes
every
now
and
then
kill
the
fool
not
now
not
when
there
were
smithymen
with
guns
waiting
to
be
taken
the
power
of
the
goddess
worked
stronger
in
her
withered
breast
as
her
rage
grew
at
their
impudence
coming
into
woods
with
their
stinking
metal
there
were
two
of
them
a
grin
slit
her
face
she
had
not
taken
two
smithymen
together
for
thirty
moons
for
all
her
wrinkles
and
creaks
what
a
fine
vessel
she
was
for
the
power
to
be
sure
her
worthless
niece
could
run
and
jump
and
she
had
a
certain
air
but
she
never
be
such
a
vessel
her
sister
the
crone
spat
these
were
degenerate
days
in
the
old
days
the
sister
would
have
been
spitted
when
she
refused
the
ordeal
in
her
youth
the
little
one
now
whatever
her
name
was
she
would
make
a
vessel
for
the
power
when
she
was
gathered
to
the
goddess
if
her
sister
or
her
niece
did
hold
her
head
under
water
too
long
or
have
a
spear
shoved
too
deep
into
her
gut
or
hit
her
on
the
head
with
too
heavy
a
rock
these
were
degenerate
days
she
had
poisoned
her
own
mother
to
become
the
vessel
of
power
the
spearmen
to
her
right
and
left
shifted
uneasily
she
heard
a
faint
mumble
of
the
two
smithymen
talking
let
them
talk
doubtless
they
were
cursing
the
goddess
obscenely
doubtless
that
was
what
the
smithymen
all
did
when
their
mouths
were
not
stuffed
with
food
she
thought
of
the
man
called
kennedy
who
forged
spearheads
and
arrowpoints
for
her
people
he
was
a
strange
one
touched
by
the
goddess
which
proved
her
infinite
power
she
could
touch
and
turn
the
head
of
even
a
smithyman
he
was
a
strange
one
well
now
to
get
on
with
it
she
wished
the
power
were
working
stronger
in
her
she
was
tired
and
could
hardly
see
but
by
the
grace
of
the
goddess
there
would
be
two
new
heads
over
her
holy
hut
come
dawn
she
could
hardly
see
but
the
goddess
would
fail
her
she
quavered
like
a
and
the
spearmen
began
to
slip
forward
through
the
brush
she
was
not
allowed
to
eat
honey
lest
its
sweetness
clash
with
the
power
in
her
but
the
taste
of
power
was
sweeter
than
the
taste
of
honey
with
frightful
suddenness
there
was
an
shriek
and
a
trampling
rush
of
feet
by
sheer
reflex
orsino
clamped
down
on
the
trigger
of
his
fifty
and
his
brain
rocked
at
its
thunder
shadowy
figures
were
blotted
out
by
the
orange
you
supposed
to
fire
neat
spaced
bursts
of
eight
he
told
himself
i
wonder
what
old
gilby
would
say
if
he
could
see
his
star
pupil
burning
out
a
barrel
and
swinging
his
gun
like
a
fire
hose
the
gun
stopped
firing
end
of
the
belt
twenty
fifty
or
a
hundred
rounds
he
did
remember
he
clawed
for
another
belt
and
smoothly
in
the
dark
loaded
again
and
listened
you
all
right
gangster
the
jaygee
said
behind
him
making
him
jump
yes
he
said
will
they
come
back
i
do
know
you
filthy
swine
an
agonized
voice
wheezed
from
the
darkness
me
back
is
broke
you
stinking
lice
the
voice
began
to
sob
they
listened
to
it
in
silence
for
perhaps
a
minute
at
last
he
said
to
the
jaygee
if
the
rest
are
gone
maybe
we
can
at
least
make
him
comfortable
too
risky
the
jaygee
said
after
a
long
pause
the
sobbing
went
on
as
the
excitement
of
the
attack
drained
from
orsino
he
felt
deathly
tired
cramped
and
thirsty
the
thirst
he
could
do
something
about
he
scooped
water
from
the
muddy
runnel
by
his
knee
and
sucked
it
from
his
palms
twice
the
third
time
he
thought
of
the
thirst
that
the
sobbing
creature
out
in
the
dark
must
be
feeling
and
his
hand
would
go
to
his
mouth
i
going
to
get
him
he
whispered
to
the
jaygee
stay
where
you
are
that
an
order
he
did
answer
but
began
to
work
his
cramped
and
aching
body
from
under
the
jeep
the
jaygee
a
couple
of
years
younger
and
lither
than
he
slid
out
first
from
his
own
side
orsino
sighed
and
relaxed
as
he
heard
his
footsteps
cautiously
circle
the
jeep
finish
me
off
the
wounded
man
was
sobbing
for
the
love
of
the
goddess
finish
me
off
you
bitches
bastards
you
broke
me
back
that
was
a
cry
of
savage
delight
there
was
a
strangled
noise
from
the
jaygee
and
then
only
a
soft
deadly
thrashing
noise
from
the
dark
hell
orsino
thought
bitterly
it
was
my
idea
he
snaked
out
from
under
the
jeep
and
raced
through
wet
brush
the
two
of
them
were
a
tangled
knot
of
darkness
rolling
on
the
ground
a
naked
back
came
uppermost
orsino
fell
on
it
and
clawed
at
its
head
he
felt
a
huge
beard
took
two
of
it
and
pulled
as
hard
as
he
could
there
was
a
wild
screech
and
a
flailing
of
arms
the
jaygee
broke
away
and
stood
up
panting
hoarsely
charles
heard
a
sharp
crunch
and
a
snap
and
the
flailing
sweaty
figure
beneath
him
lay
still
back
to
the
guns
the
jaygee
choked
he
swayed
and
orsino
took
him
by
the
arm
on
the
way
back
to
the
jeep
they
stumbled
over
something
that
was
certainly
a
body
orsino
flesh
shrank
from
lying
down
again
in
the
mud
behind
his
gun
but
he
did
shivering
he
heard
the
jaygee
thud
wearily
into
position
what
did
you
do
to
him
he
asked
is
he
dead
kicked
him
the
jaygee
choked
his
head
snapped
back
and
there
was
that
crack
i
guess
he
dead
i
never
heard
of
that
trick
before
i
guess
he
wanted
to
take
one
more
with
him
they
have
a
kind
of
religion
the
jaygee
sounded
as
though
he
was
teetering
on
the
edge
of
breakdown
make
him
mad
intuition
said
to
orsino
he
might
go
howling
off
among
the
trees
unless
he
snaps
out
of
it
it
a
hell
of
way
to
run
an
island
he
said
nastily
you
beggars
were
chased
out
of
north
america
because
you
could
run
it
right
and
now
you
ca
even
control
a
lousy
little
island
for
more
than
five
miles
inland
he
added
with
deliberate
superior
amusement
of
course
they
got
witches
shut
your
mouth
gangster
warning
the
note
of
hysteria
was
still
there
and
then
the
jaygee
said
dully
i
did
mean
that
sorry
you
did
come
out
and
help
me
after
all
surprised
yes
twice
first
time
when
you
wanted
to
go
out
yourself
i
suppose
you
ca
help
being
born
where
you
were
maybe
if
you
came
over
to
us
all
the
way
the
government
would
forgive
and
forget
but
no
i
suppose
not
he
paused
obviously
casting
about
for
a
change
of
subject
he
still
seemed
sublimely
confident
that
they
get
back
to
the
naval
base
with
him
in
charge
of
the
detail
what
ship
did
you
cross
in
atom
sub
orsino
said
he
could
have
bitten
his
tongue
out
that
my
father
pigboat
captain
van
dellen
how
is
he
i
was
going
down
to
the
dock
when
he
dead
orsino
said
flatly
he
was
caught
on
deck
during
an
emergency
dive
the
jaygee
said
nothing
for
a
while
and
then
uttered
an
unconvincing
laugh
of
disbelief
you
lying
he
said
his
crew
never
let
that
happen
they
let
the
ship
be
blown
to
hell
before
they
took
her
down
without
the
skipper
grinnel
had
the
con
he
ordered
the
dive
and
roared
down
the
crew
when
they
wanted
to
get
your
father
inboard
i
sorry
grinnel
the
jaygee
whispered
grinnel
yes
i
know
commander
grinnel
he
he
a
good
officer
he
must
have
done
it
because
he
had
to
tell
me
about
it
please
it
was
more
than
orsino
could
bear
your
father
was
murdered
he
said
harshly
i
know
because
grinnel
put
me
on
radar
watch
and
i
do
know
a
thing
about
reading
a
radarscope
he
told
me
to
sing
out
planes
and
i
did
because
i
did
know
what
the
hell
was
going
on
he
used
that
as
an
excuse
to
while
your
father
was
sleeping
on
deck
your
good
officer
murdered
him
he
heard
the
jaygee
sobbing
hoarsely
at
last
he
asked
orsino
in
a
dry
choked
voice
politics
politics
orsino
said
orsino
jumped
wildly
as
the
jaygee
machine
gun
began
to
roar
a
long
burst
of
twenty
but
he
did
fire
himself
he
knew
that
there
was
no
enemy
out
there
in
the
dark
and
that
the
bullets
were
aimed
only
at
an
absent
phantom
we
got
to
get
to
iceland
the
jaygee
said
at
last
soberly
our
only
chance
iceland
this
is
one
for
the
of
the
constitutionists
the
central
committee
it
a
breach
of
the
freiberg
compromise
it
means
we
call
the
sociocrats
and
if
they
do
make
full
restitution
war
what
do
you
mean
you
and
i
you
the
source
of
the
story
you
the
one
who
be
you
got
him
orsino
told
himself
but
do
be
fool
enough
to
count
on
it
he
been
from
hunger
and
no
sleep
and
the
shock
of
his
father
death
you
helped
him
in
a
death
struggle
and
there
team
spirit
working
on
him
the
guy
covering
my
back
how
can
i
fail
to
trust
him
how
could
i
dare
not
to
trust
him
but
do
be
fool
enough
to
count
on
it
after
he
slept
meanwhile
push
it
for
all
it
worth
what
are
your
plans
he
asked
gravely
we
got
to
slip
out
of
ireland
by
sub
or
plane
the
jaygee
brooded
we
ca
go
to
the
new
portsmouth
or
organizations
sociocrat
and
grinnel
will
have
passed
the
word
to
the
sociocrats
that
you
out
of
control
what
does
that
mean
death
the
jaygee
said
xii
commander
grinnel
after
reporting
formally
had
gone
straight
to
a
joint
it
was
until
midnight
that
he
got
the
word
from
a
friendly
lieutenant
who
had
dropped
into
the
house
what
grinnel
roared
who
is
this
woman
where
is
she
take
me
to
her
at
once
commander
the
lieutenant
said
aghast
i
just
got
here
you
heard
me
mister
at
once
while
grinnel
dressed
he
demanded
particulars
the
lieutenant
dutifully
scoured
his
memory
brought
in
on
some
deal
commander
the
kind
you
usually
run
jacobi
was
in
syndic
territory
on
a
recruiting
sabotage
and
reconnaissance
mission
and
one
of
the
passed
the
girl
on
him
a
real
syndic
member
priceless
and
as
i
said
she
identified
this
fellow
as
charles
orsino
another
syndic
why
are
you
so
interested
if
i
may
ask
the
commander
dearly
wanted
to
give
him
a
grim
you
may
not
but
did
dare
now
was
the
time
to
be
frank
and
open
one
hint
that
he
had
anything
to
hide
or
cover
up
would
put
his
throat
to
the
knife
the
man
my
baby
lieutenant
he
said
either
your
girl
mistaken
or
van
dellen
and
his
polygraph
tech
and
i
were
taken
in
by
a
technique
was
nice
work
he
congratulated
himself
got
in
van
dellen
and
the
tech
maybe
come
to
think
of
it
the
tech
crooked
no
there
was
the
way
wyman
had
responded
perfectly
under
scop
building
was
two
stories
and
an
attic
beginning
to
rot
already
in
the
eternal
irish
damp
we
got
her
on
the
third
floor
commander
the
lieutenant
said
you
get
there
by
a
ladder
in
god
name
why
they
walked
past
the
charge
of
quarters
who
snapped
to
a
guilty
and
belated
attention
and
through
the
deserted
offices
of
the
first
and
second
floors
frankly
we
had
a
little
trouble
hanging
on
to
her
she
runs
away
no
nothing
like
that
not
yet
at
least
marine
and
guard
intelligence
school
have
both
tried
to
snatch
her
from
us
first
with
requisitions
then
with
muscle
we
hope
to
keep
her
until
the
word
gets
to
iceland
then
naturally
be
out
in
the
cold
the
lieutenant
laughed
grinnel
puffing
up
the
ladder
did
not
the
door
and
lock
on
lee
bennet
quarters
were
impressive
the
lieutenant
rapped
are
you
awake
lee
there
an
officer
here
who
wants
to
talk
to
you
come
in
she
said
the
lieutenant
hands
flew
over
the
lock
and
the
door
sprang
open
the
girl
was
sitting
in
the
dark
i
commander
grinnel
my
dear
he
said
after
eight
hours
in
the
joint
he
could
feel
authentically
fatherly
to
her
if
the
time
quite
convenient
it
all
right
she
said
listlessly
what
do
you
want
to
know
the
man
you
identify
as
orsino
it
was
quite
a
shock
to
me
commander
van
dellen
who
died
a
hero
death
only
days
ago
accepted
him
as
authentic
and
so
i
must
admit
did
i
he
passed
both
scop
and
polygraph
i
ca
help
that
she
said
he
came
right
up
to
me
and
told
me
who
he
was
i
recognized
him
of
course
he
a
polo
player
i
seen
him
play
on
long
island
often
enough
the
damned
snob
he
not
much
in
the
syndic
but
he
close
to
taylor
orsino
an
orphan
i
do
know
whether
taylor
actually
adopted
him
or
not
i
think
not
no
possible
mistake
no
possible
mistake
she
began
to
tremble
my
god
commander
do
you
think
i
could
forget
one
of
those
damned
sneering
faces
or
what
those
people
did
to
me
get
the
lie
detector
again
strap
me
into
the
lie
detector
i
insist
on
it
i
wo
be
called
a
liar
do
you
hear
me
get
the
lie
detector
please
the
commander
soothed
i
do
believe
you
my
dear
nobody
could
doubt
your
sincerity
thank
you
for
helping
us
and
good
night
he
backed
out
of
the
room
with
the
lieutenant
as
the
door
closed
he
snapped
at
him
well
mister
the
lieutenant
shrugged
the
lie
detector
always
bears
her
out
stopped
using
it
on
her
we
convinced
that
she
on
our
side
almost
deserving
of
citizenship
come
now
the
commander
said
you
know
better
than
that
behind
the
locked
door
lee
bennet
had
thrown
herself
on
the
bed
she
wished
she
could
cry
but
tears
never
came
not
since
those
three
roistering
drunkards
had
demonstrated
their
virility
as
males
and
their
immunity
as
syndics
on
her
she
could
cry
any
more
illustration
charles
orsino
another
one
of
them
she
hoped
they
caught
him
and
killed
him
slowly
she
knew
all
this
was
true
then
why
did
she
feel
like
a
murderess
why
did
she
think
incessantly
of
suicide
why
why
why
dawn
came
imperceptibly
first
charles
could
discern
the
outline
of
treetops
against
the
sky
and
then
a
little
of
the
terrain
before
him
and
at
last
two
twisted
shadows
that
slowly
became
sprawling
bodies
one
of
them
was
a
woman
mangled
by
slugs
the
other
was
the
body
of
a
bearded
giant
the
one
with
whom
they
had
struggled
in
the
dark
charles
crawled
out
stiffly
the
woman
was
had
been
a
stringy
white
haired
crone
some
animal
skull
was
tied
to
her
pate
with
sinews
as
a
and
she
was
tattooed
with
blue
crescents
the
jaygee
joined
him
standing
over
her
and
said
one
of
their
witches
part
of
the
religion
if
you
can
call
it
that
a
religion
charles
asked
dubiously
made
up
out
of
whole
cloth
no
the
jaygee
said
i
understand
it
an
religion
it
kept
going
underground
until
the
troubles
then
it
flared
up
again
all
over
europe
a
filthy
business
animal
sacrifices
every
new
moon
human
sacrifices
twice
a
year
what
can
you
expect
from
people
like
that
charles
reminded
himself
that
the
jaygee
boiled
recalcitrant
slaves
i
see
what
i
can
do
about
the
jeep
he
said
the
jaygee
sat
down
on
the
wet
grass
what
the
hell
the
use
he
mumbled
wearily
even
if
you
get
it
running
again
even
if
we
get
back
to
the
base
they
be
gunning
for
you
maybe
they
be
gunning
for
me
if
they
killed
my
father
he
tried
to
smile
you
got
any
aces
in
the
hole
gangster
maybe
orsino
said
slowly
what
do
you
know
about
a
woman
named
lee
bennet
works
with
smuggled
over
here
by
the
a
goldmine
of
information
she
a
little
nuts
too
what
have
you
got
on
her
does
she
swing
any
weight
she
a
citizen
no
weight
they
just
using
her
over
at
intelligence
to
fill
out
the
picture
of
the
syndic
and
she
could
be
a
citizen
a
woman
has
to
marry
a
citizen
to
be
naturalized
what
have
you
got
to
do
with
her
for
god
sake
did
you
know
her
on
the
other
side
she
death
to
the
syndic
she
ca
do
anything
for
you
charles
barely
heard
him
that
had
to
be
it
the
trigger
on
lee
falcaro
conditioning
had
to
be
the
oath
of
citizenship
as
it
was
for
his
and
it
had
been
tripped
because
this
pirate
gang
particularly
want
or
need
women
as
citizens
a
small
part
of
the
government
cultural
complex
but
one
that
could
trap
lee
falcaro
forever
in
the
shell
of
her
synthetic
substitute
for
a
personality
yes
scopolamine
yes
but
for
a
woman
no
subsequent
oath
i
ran
into
her
in
new
portsmouth
she
knew
me
from
the
other
side
she
turned
me
in
he
knelt
at
a
puddle
and
drank
thirstily
the
water
eased
hunger
cramps
a
little
i
see
what
i
can
do
with
the
jeep
he
lifted
the
hood
and
stole
a
look
at
the
jaygee
van
dellen
was
dropping
off
to
sleep
on
the
wet
grass
charles
pried
a
shear
pin
from
the
jeep
winch
punched
out
the
shear
pin
that
had
given
way
in
the
transmission
and
replaced
it
it
involved
some
hammering
cracked
block
he
thought
contemptuously
an
officer
and
he
could
tell
whether
the
block
was
cracked
or
not
if
i
ever
get
out
of
this
we
sweep
them
from
the
face
of
the
earth
or
more
likely
just
get
rid
of
their
sociocrats
and
constitutionists
the
rest
are
probably
all
right
except
maybe
for
those
bastards
of
guardsmen
a
bad
lot
hope
they
get
killed
in
the
fighting
the
small
of
his
back
tickled
he
reached
around
to
scratch
it
and
felt
cold
metal
turn
slowly
or
you
be
spitted
like
a
pig
a
bass
voice
growled
he
turned
slowly
the
cold
metal
now
at
his
chest
was
the
blade
of
a
spear
it
was
wielded
by
a
giant
whose
eyes
were
as
cold
as
death
tie
that
one
somebody
said
another
man
jerked
his
wrists
behind
him
and
lashed
them
together
with
cords
hobble
his
feet
it
was
a
woman
voice
a
length
of
cord
or
sinew
was
knotted
to
his
ankles
with
a
foot
or
two
of
play
he
could
walk
but
not
run
the
giant
lowered
his
spear
and
stepped
aside
the
first
thing
charles
saw
was
that
lieutenant
van
dellen
of
the
north
american
navy
had
escaped
forever
from
his
doubts
and
confusions
they
had
skewered
him
to
the
turf
while
he
slept
charles
hoped
he
had
not
felt
the
blow
the
second
thing
he
saw
was
a
supple
and
coltish
girl
of
perhaps
tenderly
removing
the
animal
skull
from
the
head
of
the
slain
witch
and
knotting
it
to
her
own
head
even
to
orsino
numbed
understanding
it
was
clearly
an
act
of
the
highest
significance
it
subtly
changed
the
composition
of
the
group
in
the
little
glade
they
had
been
a
small
mob
until
she
put
on
the
skull
but
the
moment
she
did
they
moved
instinctively
one
a
step
or
two
the
other
merely
turning
a
bit
perhaps
to
orient
on
her
there
was
no
doubt
that
she
was
in
charge
a
witch
orsino
thought
it
kept
going
underground
until
the
troubles
a
filthy
business
human
sacrifices
twice
a
year
she
approached
him
and
like
the
shifting
of
a
kaleidoscope
the
group
fell
into
a
new
pattern
of
which
she
was
still
the
focus
charles
thought
he
had
never
seen
a
face
so
humorlessly
conscious
of
power
the
petty
ruler
of
a
few
barbarians
she
carried
herself
as
though
she
were
empress
of
the
universe
nor
did
a
large
gray
louse
that
crawled
from
her
hairline
across
her
forehead
and
back
again
affect
her
in
the
slightest
she
wore
a
greasy
animal
hide
as
though
it
were
royal
purple
it
added
up
to
either
insanity
or
a
limitless
pretension
to
religious
authority
and
her
eyes
were
not
mad
you
she
said
coldly
what
about
the
jeep
and
the
guns
do
they
go
he
laughed
suddenly
and
idiotically
at
these
words
from
the
mouth
of
a
goddess
a
raised
spear
sobered
him
instantly
yes
he
said
show
my
men
how
she
said
and
squatted
regally
on
the
turf
please
he
said
could
i
have
something
to
eat
first
she
nodded
indifferently
and
one
of
the
men
loped
off
into
the
brush
his
hands
untied
and
his
face
greasy
with
venison
fat
charles
spent
the
daylight
hours
instructing
six
savages
in
the
nomenclature
maintenance
and
operation
of
the
jeep
and
the
machine
gun
they
absorbed
it
with
utter
lack
of
curiosity
they
more
or
less
learned
to
start
and
steer
and
stop
the
jeep
they
more
or
less
learned
to
load
point
and
fire
the
gun
through
the
lessons
the
girl
sat
absolutely
motionless
first
in
shadow
then
in
noon
and
afternoon
sun
and
then
in
shadow
again
but
she
had
been
listening
she
said
at
last
you
are
telling
them
nothing
new
now
is
there
no
more
charles
noted
that
a
spear
was
poised
at
his
ribs
a
great
deal
more
he
said
hastily
it
takes
months
they
can
work
them
now
what
more
is
there
to
learn
well
what
to
do
if
something
goes
wrong
she
said
as
though
speaking
from
vast
experience
when
something
goes
wrong
you
start
over
again
that
is
all
you
can
do
when
i
make
for
the
spear
blades
and
the
does
not
kill
it
is
because
something
went
wrong
a
word
or
a
sign
or
picking
a
plant
at
the
wrong
time
the
only
thing
to
do
is
make
the
poison
again
as
you
grow
in
experience
you
make
fewer
mistakes
that
is
how
it
will
be
with
my
men
when
they
work
the
jeep
and
the
guns
she
nodded
ever
so
slightly
at
one
of
the
men
and
he
took
a
firmer
grip
on
his
spear
death
swooped
low
no
charles
exploded
you
do
understand
this
is
like
anything
you
do
at
all
he
was
sweating
even
in
the
late
afternoon
chill
you
got
to
have
somebody
who
knows
how
to
repair
the
jeep
and
the
gun
if
they
busted
they
busted
and
no
amount
of
starting
over
again
will
make
them
work
she
nodded
and
said
tie
his
hands
we
take
him
with
us
charles
was
torn
between
relief
and
wonder
at
the
way
she
spoke
he
realized
that
he
had
never
literally
seen
any
person
concede
a
point
in
quite
that
fashion
there
had
been
no
hesitation
there
had
been
no
reluctance
in
the
voice
not
a
flicker
of
displeasure
in
the
face
simply
without
forcing
she
had
said
we
take
him
with
us
it
was
as
though
as
though
she
had
the
immediate
past
her
opposition
to
the
idea
nullifying
it
she
was
a
person
who
was
not
at
war
with
herself
in
any
respect
whatever
a
person
who
knew
exactly
who
she
was
and
what
she
was
the
girl
rose
in
a
single
flowing
motion
startling
after
her
day
spent
in
immobility
she
led
the
way
flanked
by
two
of
the
spearmen
the
other
four
followed
in
the
jeep
at
a
crawl
last
of
all
came
charles
and
nobody
had
to
urge
him
in
his
portable
trap
his
hours
would
be
numbered
if
he
got
separated
from
his
captors
stick
with
them
he
told
himself
stumbling
through
the
brush
just
stay
alive
and
you
can
outsmart
these
savages
he
fell
cursed
picked
himself
up
stumbled
on
after
the
growl
of
the
jeep
dawn
brought
them
to
a
collection
of
huts
a
corral
enclosing
a
few
dozen
head
of
wretched
diseased
cattle
a
few
adults
and
a
few
children
the
girl
was
still
and
supple
in
her
movements
her
spearmen
yawned
and
stretched
stiffly
charles
was
a
walking
dead
man
battered
by
countless
trees
and
stumbles
on
the
long
trek
with
red
and
swollen
eyes
he
watched
while
brats
swarmed
over
the
jeep
and
grownups
made
obeisances
to
the
girl
all
but
one
this
was
an
harridan
who
said
to
her
with
cool
insolence
i
see
you
claim
the
power
of
the
goddess
now
my
dear
has
something
happened
to
my
sister
the
guns
killed
a
certain
person
i
put
on
the
skull
you
know
what
i
am
do
not
say
to
be
i
warn
you
once
liar
shrieked
the
harridan
you
killed
her
and
stole
the
skull
patrick
and
bridget
shrivel
your
guts
abaddon
and
lucifer
pierce
your
eyes
an
arena
formed
about
them
as
the
girl
said
coldly
i
warn
you
the
second
time
the
harridan
made
signs
with
her
fingers
glaring
at
her
there
was
a
moan
from
the
watchers
some
turned
aside
and
a
girl
fainted
dead
away
the
girl
with
the
skull
on
her
pate
said
as
though
speaking
from
a
million
years
and
a
million
miles
away
this
is
the
third
warning
there
are
no
more
now
the
worm
is
in
your
backbone
gnawing
now
the
maggots
are
at
your
eyes
devouring
them
your
bowels
turn
to
water
your
heart
pounds
like
the
heart
of
a
bird
soon
it
will
not
beat
at
all
as
the
eerie
whisper
drilled
on
the
watchers
broke
and
ran
holding
their
hands
over
their
ears
but
the
harridan
stood
as
if
rooted
to
the
earth
charles
listened
dully
as
the
curse
was
droned
nor
was
he
surprised
when
the
harridan
fell
blasted
by
it
another
sorceress
aided
it
is
true
by
pentothal
had
months
ago
done
the
same
to
him
the
people
trickled
back
muttering
and
abject
just
stay
alive
and
you
can
outsmart
these
savages
he
repeated
ironically
to
himself
it
had
dawned
on
him
that
these
savages
lived
by
an
obscure
and
complicated
code
harder
to
master
than
the
intricacies
of
the
syndic
or
the
government
a
kick
roused
him
to
his
feet
one
of
the
spearmen
grunted
i
putting
you
with
kennedy
all
right
charles
groaned
you
take
these
cords
off
me
later
he
prodded
charles
to
a
minute
ugly
block
house
of
logs
from
which
came
smoke
and
an
irregular
metallic
clanging
he
cut
the
cords
rolled
great
boulders
away
from
a
and
shoved
him
through
the
place
was
about
six
by
nine
feet
hemmed
in
by
logs
the
light
was
very
bad
and
the
smell
was
too
a
few
loopholes
let
in
some
air
there
was
a
latrine
pit
and
an
open
stone
hearth
and
a
naked
brown
man
with
wild
hair
and
a
beard
rubbing
his
wrists
charles
asked
uncertainly
are
you
kennedy
the
man
looked
up
and
croaked
are
you
from
the
government
yes
charles
said
hope
rekindling
thank
god
they
put
us
together
there
a
jeep
also
a
if
we
play
this
right
the
two
of
us
can
bust
out
he
stopped
disconcerted
kennedy
had
turned
to
the
hearth
and
the
small
fierce
fire
glowing
on
it
and
began
to
pound
a
lump
of
metal
there
were
spear
heads
and
arrow
heads
about
in
various
stages
of
completion
as
well
as
files
and
a
hone
what
the
matter
he
demanded
are
you
interested
of
course
i
interested
kennedy
said
but
we
got
to
begin
at
the
beginning
you
too
his
voice
was
mild
but
reproving
you
right
charles
said
i
guess
you
made
a
try
or
two
yourself
but
now
that
there
are
two
of
us
what
do
you
suggest
can
you
drive
a
jeep
can
you
fire
a
the
man
poked
the
lump
of
metal
into
the
heart
of
the
fire
again
picked
up
a
spear
head
and
began
to
file
an
edge
into
it
get
down
to
essentials
he
suggested
apologetically
what
is
escape
getting
from
an
undesirable
place
to
a
desirable
place
opposing
and
neutralizing
things
or
persons
adverse
to
the
change
of
state
in
the
process
but
i
not
being
specific
am
i
let
say
then
escape
is
getting
from
a
relatively
undesirable
place
to
a
relatively
desirable
place
opposing
and
neutralizing
the
aborigines
he
put
aside
the
file
and
reached
for
the
hone
sleeking
it
along
the
bright
metal
ribbon
of
the
new
edge
he
looked
up
with
a
pleased
smile
and
asked
how
that
for
a
plan
fine
charles
muttered
kennedy
beamed
proudly
as
he
repeated
fine
fine
and
sank
to
the
ground
born
down
by
the
almost
physical
weight
of
his
depression
his
ally
was
stark
mad
xiii
kennedy
turned
out
to
have
been
an
of
the
north
american
navy
captured
two
years
ago
while
too
far
from
the
road
to
new
portsmouth
fed
on
scraps
of
gristle
isolated
from
his
kind
beaten
when
he
failed
to
make
his
daily
task
of
spear
heads
and
arrow
points
he
had
shyly
retreated
into
beautifully
interminable
labyrinths
of
abstraction
now
and
then
charles
orsino
got
a
word
or
two
of
sense
from
him
before
the
rosy
clouds
closed
in
when
attempted
conversation
with
the
lunatic
palled
charles
could
watch
the
aborigines
through
chinks
in
the
palisade
there
were
about
fifty
of
them
there
would
have
been
more
if
they
had
been
given
to
infanticide
for
what
reason
charles
could
not
guess
he
had
been
there
a
week
when
the
boulders
were
rolled
away
one
morning
and
he
was
roughly
called
out
he
said
to
kennedy
before
stooping
to
crawl
through
the
hole
take
it
easy
friend
i
be
back
i
hope
kennedy
looked
up
with
a
puzzled
smile
that
such
a
statement
charles
exactly
what
are
you
implying
the
witch
girl
was
there
flanked
by
spearmen
she
said
abruptly
i
have
been
listening
to
you
why
are
you
untrue
to
your
brothers
he
gawked
the
only
thing
that
seemed
to
fit
was
that
such
a
statement
but
he
did
say
it
answer
one
of
the
spearmen
growled
i
i
do
understand
i
have
no
brothers
your
brothers
in
portsmouth
on
the
sea
whatever
you
call
them
they
are
your
brothers
all
children
of
the
mother
called
government
why
are
you
untrue
to
them
he
began
to
understand
they
are
my
brothers
i
not
a
child
of
the
government
i
a
child
of
another
mother
far
away
called
syndic
she
looked
puzzled
and
almost
human
for
an
instant
then
the
visor
dropped
over
her
face
again
as
she
said
that
is
true
now
you
must
teach
a
certain
person
the
jeep
and
the
guns
teach
her
well
see
that
she
gets
her
hands
on
the
metal
and
into
the
grease
to
a
spearman
she
said
bring
martha
the
spearman
brought
martha
who
was
trying
not
to
cry
she
was
a
child
of
ten
the
witch
girl
abruptly
left
them
her
guards
took
martha
and
bewildered
charles
to
the
edge
of
the
village
where
the
jeep
and
its
mounted
guns
stood
behind
a
silly
little
museum
exhibit
rope
of
vine
feathers
and
bones
were
knotted
into
the
vine
the
spearmen
treated
it
as
though
it
were
a
transmission
line
break
it
one
of
them
said
to
charles
he
did
and
the
spearmen
sighed
with
relief
martha
stopped
scowling
and
stared
the
spearman
said
to
charles
go
ahead
and
teach
her
the
firing
pins
are
out
of
the
guns
and
if
you
try
to
start
the
jeep
you
get
a
spear
through
you
now
teach
her
he
and
the
rest
squatted
on
the
turf
around
the
jeep
the
little
girl
shied
violently
as
he
took
her
hand
and
tried
to
run
away
one
of
the
spearmen
slung
her
back
into
the
circle
she
brushed
against
the
jeep
and
froze
martha
charles
said
patiently
there
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
the
guns
wo
go
off
and
the
jeep
wo
move
i
teach
you
how
to
work
them
so
you
can
kill
everybody
you
do
like
with
the
guns
and
go
faster
than
a
deer
in
the
jeep
he
was
talking
into
empty
air
as
far
as
the
child
was
concerned
she
was
muttering
staring
at
the
arm
that
had
brushed
the
jeep
that
did
it
i
guess
there
goes
the
power
may
the
goddess
blast
her
no
the
out
of
me
now
i
felt
it
go
she
looked
up
at
charles
quite
calmly
and
said
go
on
show
me
all
about
it
do
a
good
job
martha
what
are
you
talking
about
she
was
afraid
of
me
my
sister
so
she
robbing
me
of
the
power
do
you
know
i
guess
not
the
goddess
hates
iron
and
machines
i
had
the
power
of
the
goddess
in
me
but
it
gone
now
i
felt
it
go
now
nobody
be
afraid
of
me
any
more
her
face
contorted
and
she
said
show
me
how
you
work
the
guns
he
taught
her
what
he
could
while
the
circle
of
spearmen
looked
on
and
grinned
cracking
raw
jokes
about
the
child
as
anybody
anywhere
would
about
a
tyrant
deposed
she
pretended
to
ignore
them
grimly
repeating
names
after
him
and
imitating
his
practiced
movements
in
loading
drill
she
was
very
bright
charles
realized
when
he
got
a
chance
he
muttered
i
sorry
about
this
martha
it
is
my
idea
she
whispered
bleakly
i
know
i
liked
you
i
was
sorry
when
the
other
outsider
took
your
dinner
she
began
to
sob
uncontrollably
i
never
see
anything
again
nobody
ever
be
afraid
of
me
again
she
buried
her
face
against
charles
shoulder
he
smoothed
her
tangled
hair
mechanically
and
said
to
the
watching
grinning
circle
look
has
this
gone
far
enough
have
you
got
what
you
wanted
the
headman
stretched
and
spat
guess
so
he
said
come
on
girl
he
yanked
martha
from
the
seat
and
booted
her
toward
the
huts
charles
scrambled
down
just
ahead
of
a
spear
he
let
himself
be
led
back
to
the
smithy
block
house
and
shoved
through
the
crawl
hole
i
was
thinking
about
what
you
said
the
other
day
kennedy
beamed
rasping
a
file
over
an
arrowhead
when
i
said
that
to
change
one
molecule
in
the
past
you
have
to
change
molecule
in
the
past
and
you
said
so
i
figured
that
what
you
were
driving
at
was
kennedy
charles
said
please
shut
up
just
this
once
i
got
to
think
in
what
sense
do
you
mean
that
charles
do
you
mean
that
you
a
rational
animal
and
therefore
that
your
rather
than
is
up
or
i
pick
up
a
rock
and
bust
your
head
in
with
it
charles
roared
he
more
than
half
meant
it
kennedy
hunched
down
before
his
hearth
looking
offended
and
scared
charles
squatted
with
his
head
in
his
hands
have
been
listening
to
repeated
drives
of
the
government
to
wipe
out
the
aborigines
drives
that
never
succeeded
never
see
anything
the
way
the
witch
girl
had
blasted
her
rival
but
that
was
suggestion
but
have
been
listening
to
you
why
are
you
untrue
to
your
brothers
he
said
nothing
like
that
to
anybody
not
to
her
or
poor
kennedy
he
thought
vaguely
of
force
a
fragment
in
his
memory
an
old
superstition
like
the
triad
of
the
psychologists
like
vectors
of
the
mind
exploded
nonsense
but
have
been
listening
to
you
why
are
you
untrue
to
your
brothers
charles
smacked
one
fist
against
the
sand
floor
in
impotent
rage
he
was
going
as
crazy
as
kennedy
did
the
witch
girl
and
martha
have
hereditary
power
he
mocked
himself
savagely
that
such
a
question
neurotic
adolescent
girls
in
farmhouses
he
thought
vaguely
things
that
go
bump
and
crash
and
blooie
and
in
the
night
not
in
electric
lit
city
apartments
not
around
men
and
women
you
take
a
hyperthyroid
virgin
isolate
her
from
power
machinery
and
electric
fields
put
on
the
pressures
that
make
her
feel
alone
and
tense
to
the
bursting
point
and
naturally
enough
something
bursts
a
chamberpot
sails
from
under
the
bed
and
shatters
on
the
skull
of
the
portrait
of
falls
with
a
crash
sure
the
nail
crystallized
and
broke
crystallized
it
neurotic
adolescent
girls
speaking
in
tongues
reading
cards
and
closed
books
screaming
aloud
when
sister
or
mother
dies
in
a
railroad
wreck
fifty
miles
away
of
cancer
a
hundred
miles
away
in
a
bombing
overseas
sometimes
they
made
saints
of
them
sometimes
they
burned
them
burned
them
and
made
saints
of
them
a
hunk
of
venison
came
sailing
through
one
of
the
loopholes
and
flopped
on
the
sand
was
sorry
when
the
other
outsider
took
your
three
days
ago
he
dozed
off
while
kennedy
broiled
the
meat
over
the
hearth
when
he
woke
kennedy
had
gobbled
it
all
and
was
whimpering
with
apprehension
but
he
done
nothing
and
said
nothing
the
man
responsible
he
said
nothing
and
yet
somehow
the
child
knew
about
it
his
days
were
numbered
soon
enough
the
jeep
would
be
out
of
gas
and
the
guns
would
be
out
of
ammo
or
an
unreplaceable
part
lost
or
broken
then
according
to
the
serene
logic
that
ruled
the
witch
girl
he
be
surplus
but
there
was
a
key
to
it
somehow
he
got
up
and
slapped
kennedy
hand
away
from
the
venison
naughty
he
said
and
divided
it
equally
with
a
broad
spearblade
naughty
kennedy
said
morosely
the
the
the
i
plus
the
universe
equal
one
the
if
you
could
transpose
but
you
ca
transpose
silently
they
toasted
their
venison
over
the
fire
it
was
a
moonless
night
with
one
great
planet
jupiter
he
supposed
reigning
over
the
sky
kennedy
slept
muttering
feebly
in
a
corner
the
hearthfire
was
out
it
had
to
be
out
by
dark
the
spearmen
took
no
chance
of
their
trying
to
burn
down
the
place
the
village
had
long
since
gone
to
sleep
campfires
doused
skin
flaps
pulled
to
across
the
door
holes
from
the
corral
one
of
the
spavined
cows
mooed
uneasily
and
then
fell
silent
charles
then
began
the
hardest
job
of
his
life
he
tried
to
think
straight
and
uninterrupted
of
martha
the
little
girl
some
of
the
things
that
interrupted
him
were
the
remembered
smell
of
fried
onions
they
did
have
onions
here
salt
i
wonder
how
the
old
precinct
getting
along
that
fellow
who
wanted
to
get
married
on
a
hundred
dollars
lee
falcaro
damn
her
this
is
damn
foolishness
it
ca
possibly
work
poor
old
kennedy
i
starve
before
i
eat
another
mouthful
of
that
greasy
the
van
dellen
kid
i
wonder
if
i
could
have
saved
him
reiner
right
we
got
to
clean
up
the
government
and
then
try
to
civilize
these
people
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
my
head
i
ca
seem
to
concentrate
that
terrific
play
in
the
finals
my
picture
all
over
town
would
uncle
frank
laugh
at
this
it
was
hopeless
he
sat
bolt
upright
his
eyes
squeezed
tensely
together
trying
to
visualize
the
child
and
call
her
and
it
could
be
done
skittering
images
of
her
zipped
through
his
mind
only
to
be
shoved
aside
it
was
damn
foolishness
anyway
he
unkinked
himself
stretched
and
lay
down
on
the
sand
floor
thinking
bitterly
why
try
you
be
dead
in
a
few
days
or
a
few
weeks
kiss
the
world
back
in
syndic
territory
fat
sloppy
happy
syndic
territory
did
they
know
how
good
they
had
it
he
wished
he
could
tell
them
to
cling
to
their
good
life
but
uncle
frank
said
it
did
do
any
good
to
cling
it
was
a
matter
of
tension
and
relaxation
when
you
stiffen
up
a
way
of
life
and
try
to
fossilize
it
so
it
stay
that
way
forever
then
you
find
you
lost
it
little
martha
would
understand
it
magic
ritual
the
power
of
the
goddess
fear
of
iron
fear
of
the
jeep
vine
enclosure
cursed
no
doubt
what
went
on
in
such
a
mind
could
she
throw
things
like
a
they
did
have
any
more
maybe
it
had
something
to
do
with
electric
fields
or
even
iron
or
were
they
all
phonies
an
upset
adolescent
girl
is
a
hell
of
a
lot
likelier
to
fake
phenomena
that
produce
them
little
martha
had
been
faking
her
despair
though
the
her
sister
was
she
did
fake
her
icy
calm
and
power
martha
be
better
off
without
such
stuff
a
whisper
said
he
muttered
stupidly
my
god
she
heard
me
and
crept
to
the
palisade
through
a
chink
between
the
logs
she
was
just
visible
in
the
starlight
she
whispered
i
thought
i
was
going
to
see
anything
or
hear
anything
ever
again
but
i
sat
up
and
i
heard
you
calling
and
you
said
you
wanted
to
help
me
if
i
help
you
so
i
came
as
fast
as
i
could
without
waking
anybody
up
you
call
me
did
you
yes
i
did
martha
do
you
want
to
get
out
of
here
go
far
away
with
me
you
bet
i
do
going
to
take
the
power
of
the
goddess
out
of
me
and
marry
me
to
dinny
he
stinks
like
a
goat
and
he
has
a
cockeye
and
then
she
kill
all
our
babies
just
tell
me
what
to
do
and
i
do
it
she
sounded
very
grim
and
decided
can
you
roll
the
boulders
away
from
the
hole
there
he
was
thinking
vaguely
of
teleportation
each
boulder
was
a
job
she
said
no
he
snarled
then
why
did
you
bother
to
come
here
do
talk
like
that
to
me
the
child
said
sharply
and
he
remembered
what
she
thought
she
was
sorry
he
said
what
i
came
about
she
said
calmly
was
the
can
you
make
an
like
you
said
back
there
at
the
jeep
what
in
god
name
was
she
talking
about
back
there
she
said
with
exaggerated
patience
you
was
thinking
about
putting
all
the
cartridges
together
and
blowing
up
the
whole
damn
shebang
remember
he
did
vaguely
one
of
a
hundred
schemes
that
had
drifted
through
his
head
i
sure
like
to
see
that
she
said
the
way
got
things
figured
i
almost
just
as
soon
get
exploded
myself
as
not
i
might
blow
up
the
logs
here
and
get
out
he
said
slowly
i
think
you
be
a
mighty
handy
person
to
have
along
too
can
you
get
me
about
a
hundred
of
the
machine
gun
cartridges
they
miss
sneak
me
a
few
at
a
time
i
empty
them
put
them
together
again
and
you
sneak
them
back
she
said
slow
and
troubled
set
the
power
of
the
goddess
to
guard
them
listen
to
me
martha
he
said
i
mean
you
be
doing
it
for
me
and
they
told
me
the
power
of
the
goddess
does
work
on
outsiders
is
that
right
there
was
a
long
pause
and
she
said
at
last
with
a
sigh
i
sure
wish
i
could
see
your
eyes
charles
i
try
it
but
i
damned
if
i
would
if
dinny
did
stink
so
bad
she
slipped
away
and
charles
tried
to
follow
her
with
his
mind
through
the
darkness
to
the
silly
little
rope
of
vine
with
the
feathers
and
bones
knotted
in
it
but
he
could
too
tense
again
kennedy
stirred
and
muttered
complainingly
as
an
icy
small
breeze
cut
through
the
chinks
of
the
palisade
whispering
his
eyes
tuned
to
the
starlight
picked
up
martha
bent
almost
double
creeping
toward
the
she
wore
a
belt
of
cartridges
around
her
neck
like
a
stole
looked
like
about
a
dozen
of
them
he
hastily
scooped
out
a
bowl
of
clean
sand
and
whispered
any
trouble
he
could
see
the
grin
on
her
face
but
knew
it
was
there
it
was
easy
she
bragged
one
bad
minute
and
then
i
checked
with
you
and
it
was
okay
good
kid
pull
the
cartridges
out
of
the
links
the
way
i
showed
you
and
pass
them
through
she
did
it
was
a
tight
squeeze
he
fingered
one
of
the
cartridges
the
bullet
fitted
nicely
into
the
socket
of
an
arrowhead
he
jammed
the
bullet
in
and
wrenched
at
the
arrowhead
with
thumb
and
forefinger
all
he
could
get
onto
it
the
brass
neck
began
to
spread
he
dumped
the
powder
into
his
little
basin
in
the
sand
and
reseated
the
bullet
charles
shifted
hands
on
the
second
cartridge
on
the
third
he
realized
that
he
could
put
the
point
of
the
bullet
on
a
and
press
on
the
neck
with
both
thumbs
it
went
faster
then
in
perhaps
an
hour
he
was
passing
the
cartridges
back
through
the
palisade
time
for
another
load
he
asked
nope
the
girl
said
tomorrow
night
good
kid
she
giggled
it
going
to
be
a
hell
of
a
big
bang
ai
it
charles
xiv
leave
the
fire
alone
charles
said
sharply
to
kennedy
the
little
man
was
going
to
douse
it
for
the
night
there
was
a
flash
of
terrified
sense
they
beat
you
if
the
fire
on
after
dark
they
beat
you
fire
and
dark
are
equal
and
opposite
he
began
to
smile
fire
is
the
negative
of
dark
you
just
change
the
sign
in
effect
rotate
it
through
degrees
but
to
rotate
it
through
degrees
you
have
to
first
rotate
it
through
one
degree
and
to
rotate
it
through
one
degree
you
first
have
to
rotate
it
through
half
a
degree
he
was
beaming
now
having
forgotten
all
about
the
fire
charles
banked
it
with
utmost
care
heaping
a
couple
of
flat
stones
for
a
chimney
that
would
preserve
the
life
of
one
glowing
coal
invisibly
he
stretched
out
on
the
sand
one
hand
on
the
little
heap
beneath
which
five
pounds
of
smokeless
powder
was
buried
kennedy
continued
to
drone
out
his
happily
through
the
chinks
in
the
palisade
a
man
profile
showed
against
the
twilight
shut
up
he
said
kennedy
shivering
rolled
over
and
muttered
to
himself
the
spearman
laughed
and
went
on
charles
hardly
saw
him
his
whole
mind
was
concentrated
on
the
spark
beneath
the
improvised
chimney
he
had
left
such
a
spark
seven
nights
running
only
twice
had
it
lived
more
than
an
hour
tonight
tonight
it
to
last
tonight
was
the
last
night
of
the
monthly
courses
and
during
them
she
lost
or
thought
she
lost
which
was
the
same
thing
the
power
of
the
goddess
primitive
aborigines
he
jeered
silently
at
himself
a
life
time
long
enough
to
learn
the
intricacies
of
their
culture
as
occasional
executions
among
them
for
violating
magical
law
proved
to
the
hilt
his
first
crude
notion
blowing
the
palisade
apart
and
running
like
hell
was
replaced
by
a
complex
escape
plan
hammered
out
in
detail
between
him
and
martha
martha
assured
him
that
the
witch
girl
could
track
him
through
the
dark
by
the
power
of
the
goddess
except
for
four
days
a
month
and
he
believed
it
martha
herself
laid
a
claim
to
keener
second
sight
than
her
sister
because
of
her
virginity
with
martha
to
guide
him
through
the
night
and
the
power
disabled
they
get
a
day
head
start
his
hand
strayed
to
a
pebble
under
which
jerked
venison
was
hidden
and
ready
but
martha
are
you
sure
you
not
not
kidding
yourself
are
you
he
felt
her
grin
on
the
other
side
of
the
palisade
you
sure
wishing
uncle
frank
was
here
so
you
could
ask
him
about
it
do
you
charles
he
sure
was
he
wiped
his
brow
suddenly
clammy
kennedy
could
come
along
one
he
was
responsible
two
he
might
have
to
be
charles
they
were
too
dissimilar
in
build
age
or
coloring
charles
had
a
beard
by
now
that
sufficiently
obscured
his
features
and
two
years
absence
should
have
softened
recollections
of
kennedy
interrogated
charles
could
take
refuge
in
an
imitation
of
kennedy
lunacy
charles
the
one
thing
i
do
get
is
this
lee
dame
she
got
a
spell
on
her
you
do
want
to
mess
with
that
listen
martha
we
to
mess
with
her
it
is
a
spell
exactly
anyway
i
know
how
to
take
it
off
and
then
she
be
on
our
side
can
i
set
off
the
explosion
if
you
let
me
set
off
the
explosion
quit
my
bitching
we
see
he
said
she
chuckled
very
faintly
in
the
dark
okay
she
told
him
if
i
ca
i
ca
he
thought
of
being
married
to
a
woman
who
could
spot
your
smallest
lie
or
reservation
and
shuddered
kennedy
was
snoring
by
now
and
twilight
was
deepening
into
blackness
there
was
a
obscured
by
he
hitched
along
the
sand
and
peered
through
a
chink
at
a
tiny
noise
it
was
the
small
scuffling
feet
of
a
racing
through
the
grass
from
one
morsel
of
food
to
the
next
it
never
reached
it
there
was
a
soft
rush
of
wings
as
a
great
dark
owl
plummeted
to
earth
and
struck
talons
into
the
brown
fur
the
rat
squealed
its
life
away
while
the
owl
lofted
silently
to
a
tree
branch
where
it
stood
on
one
leg
swaying
drunkenly
and
staring
with
huge
yellow
eyes
as
sudden
as
that
it
be
charles
thought
abruptly
weighted
with
despair
a
kid
and
yours
truly
trying
to
outsmart
and
these
wild
men
if
only
the
little
dope
would
let
me
take
the
jeep
but
the
jeep
was
out
she
rationalized
her
retention
of
the
power
even
after
handling
iron
by
persuading
herself
that
she
was
only
acting
for
charles
there
was
some
obscure
precedent
in
a
long
memorized
poem
which
served
her
as
a
of
magic
but
riding
in
the
jeep
was
by
now
she
should
be
stringing
magic
vines
across
some
of
the
huts
and
trails
they
see
when
they
get
torches
and
it
scare
of
course
i
do
know
how
to
do
it
right
but
they
do
know
that
slow
down
if
comes
out
of
her
house
and
maybe
she
wo
she
know
they
do
matter
and
send
the
men
after
us
but
we
be
on
our
way
charles
you
i
ca
set
off
the
explosion
yeah
i
guess
you
are
maybe
i
can
set
off
one
when
we
get
to
new
portsmouth
if
i
can
possibly
arrange
it
she
sighed
i
guess
that
have
to
do
it
was
too
silent
he
could
bear
it
with
feverish
haste
he
uncovered
the
caches
of
powder
and
meat
under
the
sand
was
a
fat
clayey
soil
he
dug
up
of
it
wet
it
with
the
only
liquid
available
and
worked
it
into
paste
he
felt
his
way
to
the
logs
decided
on
for
blasting
dug
out
a
hole
at
their
bases
in
the
clay
after
five
careful
trips
from
the
powder
cache
to
the
hole
the
mine
was
filled
he
covered
it
with
clay
and
laid
on
a
roof
of
flat
stones
from
the
hearth
the
spark
of
fire
still
glowed
and
he
nursed
it
with
twigs
she
was
there
whispering
charles
right
here
everything
set
all
set
let
have
that
explosion
he
took
the
remaining
powder
and
with
minute
care
laid
a
train
across
the
stockade
to
the
mine
he
crouched
into
a
ball
and
flipped
a
burning
twig
onto
the
black
line
that
crossed
the
white
sand
floor
the
blast
seemed
to
wake
up
the
world
kennedy
charged
out
of
sleep
screaming
and
a
million
birds
woke
with
a
squawk
charles
was
conscious
more
of
the
choking
reek
than
the
noise
as
he
scooped
up
the
jerked
venison
and
rushed
through
the
ragged
gap
in
the
wall
a
hand
caught
his
a
small
hand
you
groggy
martha
voice
said
sounding
far
away
come
on
fast
that
was
a
great
she
towed
him
through
the
woods
and
underbrush
fast
as
long
as
he
hung
on
to
her
he
did
stumble
or
run
into
a
tree
once
irrationally
embarrassed
by
his
dependence
on
a
child
he
tried
letting
go
for
a
short
time
very
short
and
was
quickly
battered
into
changing
his
mind
he
thought
dizzily
of
the
spearmen
trying
to
follow
through
the
dark
and
could
almost
laugh
again
their
trek
to
the
coast
was
marked
by
desperate
speed
for
hours
they
stopped
only
to
gnaw
at
their
rations
or
snatch
a
drink
at
a
stream
charles
kept
moving
because
it
was
unendurable
to
let
a
girl
exceed
him
in
stamina
both
of
them
paid
terribly
for
the
murderous
pace
they
kept
the
child
face
became
and
her
eyes
red
her
lips
dried
and
cracked
he
gasped
at
her
as
they
pulled
their
way
up
a
slope
how
do
you
do
it
this
ever
going
to
end
ends
soon
she
croaked
at
him
you
know
we
dodged
three
times
he
could
only
shake
his
head
she
stared
at
him
with
burning
red
eyes
this
ai
hard
she
croaked
you
do
this
with
a
of
poison
hard
you
she
grinned
crookedly
and
chanted
something
he
did
not
understand
moons
times
thirteen
is
the
daughter
age
when
she
drinks
the
three
leagues
times
three
she
must
race
and
rage
down
hills
and
she
added
last
year
prove
i
have
the
power
of
the
goddess
run
climb
with
your
guts
falling
out
this
year
starve
for
a
week
and
run
down
a
deer
of
seven
points
he
had
lost
track
of
days
and
nights
when
they
stood
on
the
brow
of
a
hill
at
dawn
and
looked
over
the
sea
the
girl
gasped
right
now
would
let
them
go
on
she
a
bitch
but
she
no
fool
the
child
fell
in
her
tracks
charles
too
tired
for
panic
slept
too
charles
woke
with
a
wonderful
smell
in
his
nostrils
he
followed
it
hungrily
down
the
reverse
slope
of
the
hill
to
a
grotto
martha
was
crouched
over
a
fire
on
which
rocks
were
heating
beside
it
was
a
bark
pot
smeared
with
clay
as
he
watched
she
lifted
a
rock
with
two
green
sticks
and
rolled
it
into
the
pot
it
boiled
up
and
continued
to
boil
for
an
astonishing
number
of
minutes
that
was
the
source
of
the
smell
breakfast
he
asked
unbelievingly
rabbit
stew
she
said
plenty
of
runways
plenty
of
bark
plenty
of
green
branches
i
made
snares
two
tough
old
bucks
cooking
in
there
for
an
hour
they
chewed
the
meat
from
the
bones
in
silence
she
said
at
last
we
ca
settle
down
here
too
near
to
the
coast
and
if
we
move
further
inland
there
and
others
i
been
thinking
she
spat
a
string
of
tough
meat
out
there
england
work
our
way
around
the
coast
make
a
raft
or
steal
a
canoe
and
cross
the
water
we
could
settle
down
you
ca
have
me
for
three
times
thirteen
moons
yet
or
i
lose
the
power
but
i
guess
we
can
wait
i
heard
about
england
and
the
english
they
have
no
hearts
left
we
can
take
as
many
slaves
as
we
want
they
cry
a
lot
but
they
do
fight
and
none
of
their
women
has
the
power
she
looked
up
anxiously
you
would
want
one
of
their
women
would
you
not
if
you
could
have
somebody
with
the
power
just
by
waiting
for
her
he
looked
down
the
hill
and
said
slowly
you
know
that
not
what
i
had
in
mind
martha
i
have
my
own
place
with
people
far
away
i
want
to
get
back
there
i
thought
i
thought
you
like
it
too
her
face
twisted
he
could
bear
to
go
on
not
in
words
look
into
my
mind
martha
he
said
maybe
you
see
what
it
means
to
me
she
stared
long
and
deep
at
last
she
rose
her
face
inscrutable
and
spat
into
the
fire
think
i
saved
you
for
that
she
asked
and
for
not
me
save
yourself
from
now
on
mister
i
going
to
beat
my
way
south
around
the
coast
england
for
me
and
i
do
want
any
part
of
you
she
strode
off
down
the
hill
gaunt
and
ragged
but
with
arrogance
in
her
swinging
gait
charles
sat
looking
after
her
stupefied
until
she
had
melted
into
the
underbrush
think
i
saved
you
for
that
and
for
she
made
some
kind
of
mistake
he
got
up
stiffly
and
ran
after
her
but
he
could
not
pick
up
an
inch
of
her
trail
charles
slowly
climbed
to
the
grotto
again
and
sat
in
its
shelter
he
spent
the
morning
trying
to
concoct
simple
springs
out
of
bark
strips
and
whippy
branches
he
got
nowhere
the
branches
broke
or
would
bend
far
enough
the
bark
shredded
or
would
hold
a
knot
without
metal
he
could
shape
the
trigger
to
fit
the
bow
so
that
it
would
be
both
sensitive
and
reliable
at
noon
he
drank
enormously
from
a
spring
and
looked
morosely
for
plants
that
might
be
edible
he
decided
on
something
with
a
bulbous
root
for
a
couple
of
hours
after
that
he
propped
rocks
on
sticks
here
and
there
when
he
stepped
back
and
surveyed
them
he
decided
that
any
rabbit
he
caught
with
them
would
be
even
for
a
rabbit
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
do
first
he
felt
a
slight
intestinal
qualm
and
then
a
far
from
slight
nausea
then
the
root
he
had
eaten
took
over
with
drastic
thoroughness
he
collapsed
retching
and
only
after
the
first
spasms
had
passed
was
he
able
to
crawl
to
the
grotto
the
shelter
it
offered
was
mostly
psychological
but
he
had
need
of
that
under
the
ancient
mossy
stones
he
raved
with
delirium
until
dark
sometimes
he
was
back
in
syndic
territory
charles
orsino
of
the
handicap
and
the
flashing
smile
sometimes
he
was
back
in
the
stinking
blockhouse
with
kennedy
spinning
interminable
excruciatingly
boring
strands
of
iridescent
logic
sometimes
he
was
back
in
the
psychology
laboratory
with
the
pendulum
beating
the
light
blinking
the
bell
ringing
and
flooding
him
and
drowning
him
with
lies
sometimes
he
raced
in
panic
down
the
streets
of
new
portsmouth
with
sweatered
guardsmen
pounding
after
him
their
knives
flashing
fire
but
at
last
he
was
in
the
grotto
again
with
martha
sponging
his
head
and
cursing
him
in
a
low
fluent
undertone
for
being
seven
times
seven
kinds
of
fool
she
said
tartly
as
recognition
came
into
his
eyes
yes
for
the
fifth
time
i
back
i
should
be
making
my
way
to
england
and
a
band
of
my
own
but
i
back
and
i
do
know
why
i
heard
you
in
pain
and
i
thought
it
served
you
right
for
not
knowing
deathroot
when
you
see
it
but
i
turned
around
and
came
back
do
go
he
said
hoarsely
she
held
a
bark
cup
to
his
lips
and
made
him
choke
down
some
nauseating
brew
do
worry
she
told
him
bitterly
i
wo
go
i
do
everything
you
want
which
shows
that
i
as
big
a
fool
as
you
are
or
bigger
because
i
know
better
i
help
you
find
her
and
take
the
spell
off
her
and
may
the
goddess
help
me
because
i
ca
help
myself
things
like
sawed
shells
you
call
them
a
pile
of
them
he
looks
at
them
and
he
thinks
they
going
bad
and
they
ought
to
be
used
soon
under
a
wooden
roof
they
are
a
thin
man
with
death
on
his
face
and
hate
in
his
heart
he
wears
blue
and
gold
he
sticks
the
gold
you
call
a
coat
wrist
the
cuff
he
sticks
the
cuff
under
the
nose
of
a
fellow
and
yells
his
hate
out
and
the
fellow
feels
ready
to
strangle
on
blood
it
about
a
boat
that
sank
this
fellow
he
a
fat
little
man
and
he
kills
and
kills
he
kill
the
man
if
he
could
a
picket
boat
steamed
by
the
coast
twice
a
day
north
after
dawn
and
south
before
sunset
they
had
to
watch
out
for
it
it
swept
the
coast
with
powerful
glasses
it
the
man
with
the
bellyache
again
but
now
he
sleepy
cursing
the
skipper
sure
there
nothing
on
the
coast
to
trouble
us
eight
good
men
aboard
and
that
one
bastard
of
a
skipper
sometimes
it
jumped
erratically
like
an
optical
lever
disturbed
by
the
weight
of
a
hair
board
over
the
door
painted
with
a
circle
a
on
its
side
an
line
they
call
it
office
of
intelligent
navels
the
lumber
camp
machine
goes
and
the
place
where
they
cut
metal
like
wood
on
machines
that
spin
around
a
little
fellow
loaded
down
and
chained
fell
on
his
face
he
ca
get
up
his
bowels
are
water
his
muscles
are
stiff
like
dry
branches
and
he
afraid
they
curse
him
they
beat
him
they
take
him
to
a
machine
that
spins
she
sat
bolt
upright
screaming
her
eyes
did
see
charles
he
drew
back
one
hand
and
slammed
it
across
her
cheek
in
a
slap
that
reverberated
like
a
pistol
shot
her
head
rocked
to
the
blow
and
her
eyes
snapped
back
from
she
never
told
charles
what
they
had
done
to
the
sick
slave
in
the
machine
shop
and
he
never
asked
her
without
writing
equipment
for
crutches
charles
doubted
profoundly
that
he
be
able
to
hang
onto
any
of
the
material
she
supplied
he
surprised
himself
his
memory
developed
with
exercise
the
shadowy
ranks
of
the
new
portsmouth
personnel
became
solider
daily
in
his
mind
the
whose
mainspring
was
to
get
by
with
the
smallest
possible
effort
the
little
man
in
intelligence
who
lived
only
for
the
brothels
where
he
selected
older
women
women
who
looked
like
his
mother
the
human
weasel
in
buships
who
was
impotent
in
bed
and
a
lacerating
tyrant
in
the
office
the
admiral
who
knew
he
was
dying
and
hated
his
juniors
proportionately
to
their
youth
and
health
and
this
woman
of
yours
she
ai
at
home
there
she
at
at
home
the
fat
man
the
one
that
kills
he
talking
to
her
but
she
is
yes
she
is
no
she
is
answering
him
talking
about
lee
falcaro
charles
whispered
lee
bennet
the
face
did
change
the
eerie
whisper
went
on
without
interruption
lee
bennet
on
her
lips
lee
falcaro
down
deep
in
her
guts
and
the
face
of
charles
orsino
down
there
too
an
unexpected
pang
went
through
him
he
sorted
and
classified
endlessly
what
he
had
learned
he
formed
and
rejected
a
dozen
plans
at
last
there
was
one
he
could
not
reject
xv
commander
grinnel
was
officer
of
the
day
and
sore
as
a
boil
about
it
was
supposed
to
catch
the
duty
you
risked
your
life
on
missions
let
the
fancy
dans
do
the
drudgery
but
there
he
was
nevertheless
in
the
guard
house
office
with
a
on
his
hip
the
interminable
night
stretching
before
him
and
the
main
guard
snoring
away
outside
he
eased
his
bad
military
conscience
by
reflecting
that
there
anything
to
guard
that
patrolling
the
shore
establishment
was
just
worn
out
tradition
the
ships
and
boats
had
their
own
watch
at
the
very
furthest
stretch
of
the
imagination
a
tarzan
might
sneak
into
town
and
try
to
steal
some
ammo
well
if
he
got
caught
he
got
caught
and
if
he
did
who
know
the
difference
with
the
accounting
as
sloppy
as
it
was
here
they
did
things
differently
in
iceland
they
crept
through
the
midnight
dark
of
new
portsmouth
outskirts
as
before
she
led
with
her
small
hand
lights
flared
on
a
wharf
where
perhaps
a
boat
was
being
serviced
a
slave
screamed
somewhere
under
the
lash
or
worse
here
the
doss
house
martha
whispered
it
was
smack
between
paydays
part
of
the
plan
and
the
house
was
dark
except
for
the
parlor
they
ducked
down
the
alley
that
skirted
it
and
around
the
back
of
bachelor
officer
quarters
the
sentry
if
he
were
going
his
rounds
at
all
would
be
at
the
other
end
of
his
post
when
they
passed
part
of
the
plan
lee
falcaro
was
quartered
alone
in
a
locked
room
of
the
building
martha
had
from
seventy
miles
away
frequently
watched
the
lock
being
opened
and
closed
they
dove
under
the
building
crumbling
porch
two
minutes
before
a
late
crowd
of
drinkers
roared
down
the
street
and
emerged
when
they
were
safely
gone
there
was
a
charge
of
quarters
a
little
yeoman
snoozing
under
a
dim
light
in
the
building
lobby
anybody
else
charles
whispered
edgily
no
just
her
she
asleep
dreaming
about
never
mind
come
on
charles
he
out
the
little
yeoman
did
stir
as
they
passed
him
and
crept
up
the
stairs
lee
falcaro
room
was
part
of
the
attic
finished
off
specially
you
reached
it
by
a
ladder
from
a
office
the
lock
was
an
piccolo
very
rare
in
new
portsmouth
and
presumably
loot
from
the
mainland
charles
fingers
flew
over
it
and
it
flipped
open
silently
but
the
door
squeaked
she
waking
up
martha
hissed
in
the
dark
she
yell
charles
reached
the
bed
in
two
strides
and
clamped
his
hand
over
lee
mouth
only
a
feeble
mmm
came
out
but
the
girl
thrashed
violently
in
his
grip
shut
up
lady
martha
whispered
nobody
going
to
rape
you
there
was
an
astonished
mmm
and
she
subsided
trembling
go
ahead
martha
told
him
she
wo
yell
he
took
his
hand
away
nervously
we
come
to
administer
the
oath
of
citizenship
he
said
the
girl
answered
in
the
querulous
voice
that
was
hardly
hers
you
picked
a
strange
time
for
it
who
are
you
what
all
the
whispering
for
he
improvised
i
commander
lister
just
in
from
iceland
aboard
atom
sub
they
did
tell
you
in
case
it
got
turned
down
but
i
was
sent
for
authorization
to
give
you
citizenship
you
know
how
unusual
it
is
for
a
woman
who
this
child
and
why
did
you
get
me
up
in
the
dead
of
night
he
dipped
deeply
into
martha
probings
of
the
past
week
citizenship
make
the
guard
intelligence
gang
think
twice
before
they
try
to
grab
you
again
naturally
they
try
to
block
us
if
we
administered
the
oath
in
public
ready
dramatic
she
sneered
oh
i
suppose
so
get
it
over
with
do
you
lee
bennet
solemnly
renounce
all
allegiances
previously
held
by
you
and
pledge
your
allegiance
to
the
north
american
government
i
do
she
said
there
was
a
choked
little
cry
from
martha
hell
fire
she
said
like
breaking
a
leg
what
are
you
talking
about
little
girl
lee
asked
coldly
alert
it
all
right
charles
said
wearily
do
you
know
my
voice
orsino
you
turned
me
in
back
there
because
they
do
give
citizenship
to
women
and
so
your
did
get
triggered
off
i
managed
to
break
for
the
woods
a
bunch
of
natives
got
me
i
busted
loose
with
the
help
of
martha
here
among
her
other
talents
the
kid
a
mind
reader
i
remember
the
triggering
shocked
me
out
of
a
year
growth
how
do
you
feel
lee
was
silent
but
martha
answered
in
a
voice
half
puzzled
and
half
contemptuous
she
feels
fine
but
she
crying
am
not
lee
falcaro
gulped
charles
turned
from
her
embarrassed
in
a
voice
that
strove
to
be
normal
he
whispered
to
martha
what
about
the
boat
still
there
she
said
lee
falcaro
said
tremulously
boat
martha
staked
out
a
patrol
speedboat
at
a
wharf
one
guard
aboard
she
watched
it
in
operation
and
i
have
some
time
i
really
think
we
can
grab
it
if
we
get
a
good
they
do
have
anything
based
here
that
catch
up
with
it
if
we
get
a
break
on
the
weather
their
planes
wo
be
able
to
pick
us
up
lee
falcaro
stood
up
dashing
tears
from
her
eyes
then
let
go
she
said
evenly
how
the
that
man
downstairs
martha
still
sleepin
the
way
as
clear
now
as
it
ever
be
they
closed
the
door
behind
them
and
charles
worked
the
lock
the
charge
of
quarters
looked
as
though
he
could
be
roused
by
anything
less
than
an
earthquake
as
they
passed
but
martha
stumbled
on
one
of
the
rotting
steps
after
they
were
outside
the
building
patrick
and
bridget
rot
my
clumsy
feet
off
she
whispered
awake
under
the
porch
charles
said
they
crawled
into
the
dank
space
between
porch
floor
and
ground
martha
kept
up
a
volleyfire
of
maledictions
aimed
at
herself
when
they
stopped
abruptly
charles
knew
it
was
bad
martha
held
up
her
hand
for
silence
and
charles
imagined
in
the
dark
that
he
could
see
the
strained
and
eerie
look
of
her
face
after
a
pause
she
whispered
he
using
the
what
do
you
call
it
you
talk
and
somebody
hears
you
far
away
a
prowler
he
says
to
them
a
wild
man
from
the
woods
the
bitches
bastard
must
have
seen
you
in
your
handsome
suit
of
skin
and
dirt
charles
oh
we
it
may
my
toe
that
stumbled
grow
the
size
of
a
boulder
may
my
cursed
eyes
that
did
see
the
step
fall
out
they
huddled
down
in
the
darkness
and
charles
took
lee
falcaro
hand
reassuringly
it
was
cold
a
moment
later
his
other
hand
was
taken
with
grim
possessiveness
by
the
child
martha
whispered
the
fat
little
man
the
man
who
kills
charles
he
nodded
he
thought
he
had
recognized
grinnel
from
her
picture
and
ten
men
waking
up
charles
do
you
remember
the
way
to
the
wharf
sure
he
said
but
we
net
going
to
get
separated
they
mean
mad
men
she
said
and
the
little
man
is
the
worst
they
heard
the
stomping
feet
and
a
babble
of
voices
and
commander
grinnel
clear
tenor
keep
it
quiet
men
he
may
still
be
in
the
area
the
feet
thundered
over
their
heads
on
the
porch
in
the
barest
of
whispers
martha
said
the
man
that
slept
tells
them
there
was
only
one
and
he
did
see
what
he
was
like
except
for
the
bare
skin
and
the
long
hair
and
the
fat
man
says
they
find
him
and
and
and
says
they
find
him
her
hand
clutched
desperately
and
then
dropped
it
as
the
feet
thudded
overhead
again
grinnel
was
saying
half
of
you
head
up
the
street
and
half
down
check
the
alleys
check
open
window
hell
i
do
have
to
tell
you

we
do
find
the
bastard

the
first
run

have
to
wake
up
the
whole
guard
battalion
and
patrol
the
whole
base
with
them
all
the
goddam
night
so
keep
your
eyes
open

off
remember
the
way
to
the
wharf
charles
martha
said
lady
take
care
of
him
take
good
care
of
him
she
wrenched
her
hand
away
and
darted
out
from
under
the
porch
lee
muttered
some
agonized
monosyllable
charles
started
out
after
the
child
instinctively
and
then
collapsed
weakly
back
onto
the
dirt
they
heard
the
rest
hey

it

by
god

kid
there
was
an
animal
howl
from
martha
throat
that
made
lee
falcaro
shake
hysterically
and
charles
grind
his
fingernails
into
his
palms
grinnel
sergeant
you

tie
your
shirt
around
her
head
and
take
her
into

scuffle
of
feet
and
babbling
voices
get

you
damn
fool
she
bit
my
hand
there
she
goes
and
a
single
emphatic
shot
grinnel
voice
said
into
the
silence
that
followed
that
that
men
did
you
to
shoot
commander
an
aggrieved
guardsman
said
do
blame
me

the
guy

hell
with
that
let

her
in
the
morning

a
cackle
of
harsh
laughter
grinnel
tolerantly
back
to
the
guardhouse
men
and
keep
it
quiet
they
scuffled
off
and
there
was
silence
again
for
long
minutes
charles
said
at
last
we
go
down
to
the
wharf
they
crawled
out
and
looked
for
a
moment
from
the
shelter
of
the
building
at
the
bundle
lying
in
the
road
lee
muttered
grinnel
shut
up
charles
said
he
led
her
down
deserted
alleys
and
around
empty
corners
strictly
according
to
plan
the
speedboat
was
a
craft
at
wharf
eighteen
bobbing
on
the
water
safely
removed
from
other
moored
boats
and
ships
lee
falcaro
let
out
a
small
smothered
shriek
when
she
saw
a
uniformed
sailor
sitting
in
the
cockpit
apparently
staring
directly
at
them
it
all
right
charles
said
he
a
drunk
he
always
out
cold
by
this
time
of
night
smoothly
charles
found
the
rope
locker
cut
lengths
with
the
sailor
own
knife
and
bound
and
gagged
him
the
man
eyes
opened
weary
glazed
and
red
while
this
was
going
on
and
closed
again
help
me
lug
him
ashore
charles
said
lee
falcaro
took
the
legs
and
they
eased
him
onto
the
wharf
they
went
back
into
the
cockpit
this
is
deep
water
charles
said
so
you
have
no
trouble
with
pilotage
you
can
read
a
compass
and
charts
there
an
automatic
dead
reckoner
my
advice
is
just
to
pull
the
moderator
rods
out
point
the
thing
west
pull
the
rods
out
as
far
as
they
go
and
relax
either
they
overtake
you
or
they
wo
she
was
beginning
to
get
the
drift
she
said
nervously
you
talking
as
though
you
not
coming
along
i
not
he
said
playing
the
lock
of
the
arms
rack
the
bar
fell
aside
and
he
pulled
a
pistol
from
its
clamp
he
thought
back
and
remembered
where
the
boat
diminutive
magazine
was
located
broke
the
feeble
lock
and
found
a
box
of
short
fat
heavy
little
cartridges
he
began
to
snap
them
into
the
pistol
magazine
what
do
you
think
you
up
to
lee
falcaro
demanded
appointment
with
commander
grinnel
he
said
he
slid
the
heavy
magazine
into
the
pistol
grip
and
worked
the
slide
to
jack
a
cartridge
into
the
chamber
shall
i
cast
off
for
you
he
asked
do
be
a
fool
she
said
you
sound
like
a
revival
of
a
mickey
spillane
comedy
you
ca
bring
her
back
to
life
and
you
got
a
job
to
do
for
the
syndic
you
do
it
he
said
and
snapped
another
of
the
blunt
fat
little
cartridges
into
the
magazine
she
cast
off
reached
for
the
control
and
pulled
it
hard
gee
he
gasped
you
sink
us
and
dashed
for
the
controls
you
had
seconds
before
the
turned
the
cadmium
rods
withdrew
from
their
slots
the
reactor
seethed
and
sent
boiling
metal
cycling
through
the
turbine
he
slammed
down
manual
levers
that
threw
off
the
fore
and
aft
mooring
lines
spun
the
wheel
bracing
himself
and
saw
lee
falcaro
go
down
to
the
deck
in
a
tangle
the
flying
from
her
hand
and
skidding
across
the
knurled
plastic
planking
but
by
then
the
turbine
was
screaming
an
alarm
to
the
whole
base
and
they
were
cutting
white
water
through
the
gap
in
the
harbor
net
lee
falcaro
got
to
her
feet
i
not
proud
of
myself
she
said
to
him
but
she
told
me
to
take
care
of
you
he
said
grimly
we
could
have
gone
straight
to
the
wharf
without
that
little
layover
to
pick
you
up
take
the
wheel
charles
i
he
snarled
at
her
the
she
did
and
he
went
aft
to
stare
through
the
darkness
the
harbor
lights
were
twinkling
then
his
eyes
misted
so
he
could
not
see
them
at
all
he
did
give
a
damn
if
a
dozen
corvettes
were
already
slicing
the
bay
in
pursuit
he
had
failed
xvi
it
was
a
dank
morning
sometime
during
the
night
the
quill
of
the
dead
reckoner
had
traced
its
fine
red
line
over
the
meridian
roughly
charles
orsino
thought
rubbing
the
sleep
from
his
eyes
but
the
line
was
straight
as
a
string
for
the
last
four
hours
of
their
run
the
damn
girl
must
have
fallen
asleep
on
watch
he
glared
at
her
in
the
bow
and
broke
open
a
ration
blandly
oblivious
to
the
glare
she
said
good
morning
charles
swallowed
a
mouthful
of
chocolate
and
choked
on
it
he
reached
hastily
for
water
and
found
the
tall
plastic
column
of
the
apparatus
empty
damn
it
he
snarled
why
did
you
refill
this
thing
when
you
emptied
it
and
why
did
you
overnight
you
utterly
irresponsible
he
hurled
the
bucket
overside
hauled
it
up
and
slopped
seawater
into
the
apparatus
now
there
be
a
good
twenty
minutes
before
a
drink
accumulated
just
a
minute
she
told
him
steadily
let
straighten
this
out
i
have
had
any
water
on
the
night
watch
so
i
did
have
any
occasion
to
refill
the
tube
you
must
have
taken
the
last
of
the
water
with
your
dinner
and
as
for
the
you
said
we
should
run
a
straightaway
now
and
then
to
mix
it
up
i
decided
that
last
night
was
as
good
a
time
as
any
he
took
a
minute
drink
from
the
reservoir
stalling
there
was
something
yes
he
had
to
refill
the
apparatus
after
his
dinner
ration
and
he
told
her
to
give
it
a
few
hours
of
straightaway
some
night
he
said
formally
you
quite
right
on
both
counts
i
apologize
he
bit
into
a
ration
that
not
good
enough
she
said
i
not
going
to
have
you
tell
me
you
sorry
and
then
go
scowling
and
sulking
about
the
boat
in
fact
i
do
like
your
behavior
at
all
he
said
enormously
angry
you
do
do
you
and
hated
her
the
world
and
himself
for
the
stupid
inadequacy
of
the
comeback
no
i
do
i
seriously
worried
i
afraid
the
conditioning
you
got
did
fall
away
completely
when
they
swore
you
in
you
been
acting
irrationally
and
inconsistently
what
about
you
he
snapped
you
got
conditioned
too
that
right
she
said
that
another
reason
why
you
worrying
me
i
find
impulses
in
myself
that
have
no
business
there
i
simply
seem
to
do
a
better
job
of
controlling
them
than
you
doing
for
instance
we
been
quarreling
and
at
ever
since
you
and
martha
picked
me
up
that
could
be
unless
i
were
contributing
to
the
friction
the
wheel
was
fixed
she
took
a
step
or
two
aft
and
said
professorially
i
never
had
trouble
getting
along
with
people
i
had
differences
of
course
and
at
times
i
allowed
myself
displays
of
temper
when
it
was
necessary
to
assert
myself
but
i
find
that
you
upset
me
that
for
some
reason
or
other
your
opinion
on
a
matter
is
important
to
me
that
if
it
differs
with
mine
there
should
be
a
reconciliation
he
put
down
the
ration
and
said
wonderingly
do
you
know
that
the
way
i
feel
about
you
and
you
think
it
the
conditioning
or
or
something
he
took
a
couple
of
steps
forward
hesitantly
yes
she
said
in
a
rather
tremulous
voice
the
conditioning
or
something
for
instance
you
inhibited
you
have
made
an
indecent
proposition
to
me
not
even
as
a
matter
of
courtesy
not
that
i
care
of
course
but
in
stepping
aft
she
tripped
over
the
water
bucket
and
went
down
to
the
deck
with
a
faint
scream
he
said
here
let
me
help
you
he
picked
her
up
and
did
let
go
thanks
she
said
faintly
the
conditioning
technique
ca
be
called
faulty
but
it
has
inherent
limitations
she
trailed
off
and
he
kissed
her
she
kissed
back
and
said
more
faintly
still
or
it
might
be
the
drugs
we
used
oh
charles
what
you
so
long
he
said
brooding
you
way
out
of
my
class
you
know
i
just
a
bagman
for
the
new
york
police
i
would
even
be
that
if
it
for
uncle
frank
and
you
a
falcaro
it
just
barely
thinkable
that
i
could
make
a
pass
at
you
i
guess
that
held
me
off
and
i
did
want
to
admit
it
so
i
got
mad
at
you
instead
hell
i
could
have
swum
back
to
the
base
and
made
a
damned
fool
of
myself
trying
to
find
grinnel
but
down
inside
i
knew
better
the
kid
we
make
a
psychologist
of
you
yet
she
said
psychologist
why
you
joking
no
it
not
a
joke
you
psychology
darling
you
ca
go
on
playing
polo
forever
you
know
darling
what
was
he
getting
into
old
man
gilby
was
at
sixty
was
he
good
god
was
he
hooked
into
marriage
at
was
she
married
already
did
she
know
or
care
whether
he
was
had
she
been
promiscuous
would
she
continue
to
be
he
never
know
that
was
the
one
thing
you
never
asked
your
only
comfort
if
you
needed
comfort
was
that
she
could
never
dream
of
asking
you
what
went
on
here
let
me
out
it
went
through
his
mind
in
a
single
panicky
flash
and
then
he
said
the
hell
with
it
and
kissed
her
again
she
wanted
to
know
the
hell
with
what
darling
everything
tell
me
about
psychology
i
ca
go
on
playing
polo
forever
it
was
an
hour
before
she
got
around
to
telling
him
about
psychology
the
neglect
has
been
criminal
and
inexplicable
for
about
a
century
it
been
that
psychology
is
a
dead
fallacy
why
all
right
he
said
amiably
playing
with
a
lock
of
her
hair
why
lieberman
she
said
lieberman
of
he
was
one
of
the
topological
psychology
men
do
let
the
lingo
throw
you
charles
it
just
the
name
of
a
system
he
wrote
an
attack
on
the
psychology
school
of
emotions
of
reactions
and
so
on
he
blasted
them
to
bits
by
proving
that
their
constructs
did
correspond
to
the
emotions
and
reactions
of
populations
and
then
came
the
he
tried
the
same
acid
test
on
his
school
constructs
and
found
out
that
they
did
correspond
either
it
did
frighten
him
he
was
a
scientist
he
published
and
then
the
jig
was
up
everybody
from
full
professors
to
undergraduate
students
went
down
the
roster
of
the
schools
of
psychology
and
wrecked
them
so
comprehensively
that
the
field
was
as
dead
as
palmistry
in
twenty
years
the
miracle
is
that
it
happened
before
the
flaws
were
so
glaring
textbooks
of
the
older
kind
solemnly
described
syndromes
psychoses
neuroses
that
simply
be
found
in
the
real
world
and
that
the
way
it
was
all
the
way
down
the
line
so
where
does
that
leave
us
charles
demanded
is
it
or
is
it
a
science
it
is
she
said
simply
lieberman
and
his
followers
went
too
far
it
became
a
kind
of
hysteria
the
experimenters
must
have
been
too
eager
they
misread
results
they
misinterpreted
statistics
they
misunderstood
the
claims
of
a
school
and
knocked
down
not
its
true
claims
but
claims
they
had
set
up
themselves
but
charles
protested
obscurely
embarrassed
at
the
thought
that
man
mind
was
subject
to
scientific
study
not
because
he
knew
the
first
thing
about
it
but
because
knew
psychology
was
phony
she
shrugged
i
ca
help
it
we
were
doing
physiology
of
the
sensory
organs
trying
to
settle
the
oldie
about
focusing
the
eye
and
i
got
to
grubbing
around
the
texts
looking
for
light
in
the
darkness
some
of
it
sounded
so
not
sensible
but
that
i
ran
off
one
of
lieberman
population
checks
and
the
old
boy
had
been
dead
wrong
constructs
correspond
quite
nicely
to
the
actual
way
people
minds
work
i
kept
checking
and
the
schools
that
were
destroyed
as
hopelessly
fallacious
a
century
ago
checked
out
some
closely
and
some
not
so
closely
as
good
descriptions
of
the
way
the
mind
works
some
have
predictive
value
i
used
psychology
algorithms
to
compute
the
conditioning
on
you
and
me
including
the
trigger
release
it
worked
you
see
charles
we
on
the
rim
of
something
tremendous
when
did
this
lieberman
flourish
i
do
have
the
exact
dates
in
my
head
the
breakup
of
the
schools
corresponded
roughly
with
the
lifetime
of
john
g
falcaro
that
it
rather
well
john
succeeded
rafael
who
succeeded
amadeo
falcaro
first
leader
of
the
syndic
in
revolt
under
john
the
freedom
was
enjoyed
the
bulging
were
joyously
emptied
craft
union
rules
went
joyously
out
the
window
and
builders
the
dollar
went
to
an
high
and
there
was
an
number
of
dollars
in
circulation
it
had
been
an
exhuberant
time
still
fondly
remembered
just
the
time
for
rebels
against
a
fusty
scholasticism
to
joyously
smash
old
ways
of
thought
without
too
much
exercise
of
the
conscience
it
all
checked
out
she
started
and
he
got
to
his
feet
a
discomfort
was
becoming
acute
the
speedboat
was
pitching
and
rolling
quite
seriously
for
the
first
time
since
their
escape
dirty
weather
coming
up
he
said
we
been
too
damned
lucky
so
far
he
thought
but
remark
that
there
was
much
to
worry
about
in
the
fact
that
there
seemed
to
have
been
no
pursuit
the
meager
resources
of
the
north
american
navy
would
be
spent
on
chasing
a
single
minor
craft
not
if
the
weather
could
be
counted
on
to
finish
her
off
i
thought
we
were
unsinkable
in
a
way
seal
the
boat
and
she
unsinkable
the
way
a
corked
bottle
is
but
the
boat
made
up
of
a
lot
of
bits
and
pieces
that
go
together
just
so
pound
her
for
a
few
hours
with
waves
and
the
bits
and
pieces
give
way
she
does
sink
but
she
does
steam
or
steer
either
i
wish
the
syndic
had
a
fleet
on
the
atlantic
sorry
she
said
the
nearest
fleet
i
know
of
is
mob
ore
boats
on
the
great
lakes
and
they
are
likely
to
pick
us
up
the
radar
pinged
and
they
flew
to
the
screen
at
degrees
about
eight
miles
he
said
it
ca
be
pursuit
they
could
have
any
reason
at
all
to
circle
around
us
and
come
at
us
from
ahead
he
strained
his
eyes
into
the
west
and
thought
he
could
see
a
black
speck
on
the
gray
lee
falcaro
tried
a
pair
of
binoculars
and
complained
these
things
wo
work
not
on
a
rolling
pitching
platform
they
wo
not
with
an
optical
lever
eight
miles
long
i
do
suppose
this
boat
would
have
a
signal
glass
he
spun
the
wheel
to
they
staggered
and
clung
as
the
bow
whipped
about
searched
and
steadied
on
the
new
course
the
mounting
waves
slammed
them
and
the
rolling
increased
they
hardly
noticed
their
eyes
were
on
the
radarscope
fogged
as
it
was
with
sea
return
they
nevertheless
could
be
sure
after
several
minutes
that
the
object
had
changed
course
to
charles
made
a
flying
guess
at
her
speed
read
their
own
speed
off
and
scribbled
for
a
moment
he
said
nothing
but
spun
the
wheel
to
and
went
back
to
the
radarscope
the
object
changed
course
to
charles
scribbled
again
and
said
at
last
flatly
they
running
collision
courses
on
us
automatically
computed
i
suppose
from
a
radar
we
through
he
spun
the
wheel
to
again
and
studied
the
crawling
green
spark
on
the
radarscope
this
way
we
give
the
longest
run
for
their
money
and
can
pray
for
a
miracle
the
only
way
we
can
use
our
speed
to
outrun
them
is
to
turn
around
and
head
back
into
government
territory
which
is
what
we
want
relax
lee
maybe
if
the
weather
thickens
lose
us
no
not
with
radar
they
sat
together
on
a
bunk
wordlessly
for
hours
while
the
spray
dashed
higher
and
the
boat
shivered
to
hammering
waves
briefly
they
saw
the
pursuer
three
miles
off
low
black
and
ugly
before
fog
closed
in
again
at
nightfall
there
was
the
close
triumphant
roar
of
a
big
reaction
turbine
and
a
light
stabbed
through
the
fog
flooding
the
boat
with
radiance
a
black
hull
loomed
alongside
as
a
roared
at
them
cut
your
engines
and
come
about
into
the
wind
lee
falcaro
read
letters
on
the
black
hull
james
regan
she
turned
to
charles
and
said
wonderingly
an
ore
boat
from
the
mob
great
lakes
fleet
xvii
here
charles
demanded
no
possible
mistake
she
said
stunned
when
you
a
falcaro
you
travel
i
seen
in
duluth
i
seen
in
quebec
i
seen
in
buffalo
the
voice
roared
again
dead
in
the
shroud
of
fog
come
into
the
wind
and
cut
your
engines
or
we
put
a
shell
into
you
charles
turned
the
wheel
and
wound
in
the
moderator
rod
the
boat
pitched
like
a
splinter
on
the
waves
there
was
a
muffled
double
explosion
and
two
grapnels
crunched
into
the
plastic
hull
bow
and
stern
as
the
boat
steadied
sharing
the
inertia
of
the
ore
ship
a
dark
figure
leaped
from
the
eye
of
the
searchlight
to
their
deck
and
another
and
another
hello
jim
lee
falcaro
said
almost
inaudibly
have
met
since
las
vegas
have
we
the
first
boarder
studied
her
cooly
he
was
built
for
football
or
any
other
form
of
mayhem
he
ignored
charles
completely
lee
falcaro
as
advised
do
you
still
think
twenty
reds
means
a
black
is
bound
to
come
up
you
always
were
a
fool
lee
and
now
you
in
real
trouble
what
going
on
mister
charles
snapped
we
syndics
and
i
presume
you
mobsters
do
you
recognize
the
treaty
the
boarder
turned
to
charles
inquiringly
some
confusion
he
said
max
wyman
charles
orsino
or
just
some
wild
man
from
outback
orsino
charles
said
formally
second
cousin
of
edward
falcaro
under
the
guardianship
of
francis
w
taylor
the
boarder
bowed
slightly
james
regan
iv
he
said
no
need
to
list
my
connections
it
would
take
too
long
and
i
feel
no
need
to
justify
myself
to
a
dago
chisler
watch
him
gentlemen
charles
found
his
arms
pinned
by
regan
two
companions
there
was
a
gun
muzzle
in
his
ribs
regan
shouted
to
the
ship
and
a
ladder
was
let
down
lee
falcaro
and
charles
climbed
it
with
guns
at
their
backs
he
said
to
her
who
is
that
lunatic
it
did
not
even
occur
to
him
that
the
young
man
was
who
he
claimed
to
be
the
son
of
the
mob
territory
opposite
number
of
edward
falcaro
he
regan
she
said
and
i
do
know
who
the
lunatic
him
or
me
charles
i
sorry
terribly
sorry
i
got
you
into
this
he
managed
to
smile
i
volunteered
he
said
enough
talk
regan
said
following
them
onto
the
deck
sailors
watched
them
incuriously
and
there
were
a
couple
of
men
with
a
stance
and
swagger
charles
had
come
to
know
guardsmen
he
would
have
staked
his
life
on
it
guardsmen
of
the
north
american
government
navy
aboard
a
mob
territory
ship
and
acting
as
if
they
were
passengers
or
crewmen
regan
smirked
i
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
there
are
no
accomodations
that
are
quite
right
for
you
there
are
storage
compartments
which
are
worse
than
you
deserve
and
there
are
passenger
quarters
which
are
too
good
for
you
i
afraid
it
will
have
to
be
one
of
the
compartments
your
consolation
will
be
that
it
only
a
short
run
to
chicago
chicago
headquarters
for
mob
territory
the
ore
ship
had
been
on
a
return
trip
to
chicago
when
alerted
somehow
by
the
navy
to
intercept
the
fugitives
down
there
one
of
the
men
gestured
briskly
with
a
gun
they
climbed
down
a
ladder
into
a
dark
oily
cavern
fitfully
lit
by
a
flash
in
regan
hand
make
yourselves
comfortable
regan
told
them
if
you
get
a
headache
do
worry
we
were
carrying
some
avgas
on
the
outward
run
the
flash
winked
out
and
a
door
clanged
on
them
i
ca
believe
it
charles
said
that
a
top
mob
man
could
you
be
mistaken
he
groped
in
the
dark
and
found
her
the
place
did
reek
of
gasoline
she
clung
to
him
and
said
hold
me
charles
yes
that
jimmy
regan
that
what
will
become
top
man
in
the
mob
jimmy
a
charmer
at
a
las
vegas
hotel
jimmy
a
gourmet
when
he
orders
at
the
pump
room
and
trying
to
overawe
you
jimmy
plays
polo
too
but
he
crippled
three
of
his
own
because
he
not
very
good
at
it
i
kept
telling
myself
whenever
i
ran
into
him
that
he
was
just
an
accident
the
mob
could
survive
him
but
his
father
acts
funny
there
something
with
them
there
some
they
roll
out
the
carpet
when
you
show
up
but
the
people
around
them
are
afraid
of
them
there
a
story
i
never
believed
but
i
believe
it
now
what
would
happen
if
my
uncle
pulled
out
a
pistol
and
began
screaming
and
shot
a
waiter
jimmy
father
did
it
they
tell
me
and
nothing
happened
except
that
the
waiter
was
dragged
away
and
everybody
said
it
was
a
good
thing
regan
saw
him
reach
for
his
gun
and
shot
him
first
only
the
waiter
did
have
any
gun
i
saw
jimmy
last
three
years
ago
i
have
been
in
mob
territory
since
i
did
like
it
there
now
i
know
why
give
mob
territory
enough
time
and
it
be
like
new
portsmouth
something
went
wrong
with
them
we
have
the
treaty
of
las
vegas
and
a
hundred
years
of
peace
and
there
are
many
people
going
back
and
forth
between
syndic
and
mob
except
for
a
few
like
me
who
have
to
circulate
manners
so
you
pay
duty
calls
and
shut
your
eyes
to
what
they
really
like
is
what
they
like
this
dark
damp
stinking
compartment
and
my
uncle
and
all
the
falcaros
and
you
and
i
we
are
like
them
are
we
we
her
fingers
bit
into
his
arms
she
was
shaking
easy
he
soothed
her
easy
easy
we
all
right
we
be
all
right
i
think
i
got
it
figured
out
this
must
be
some
private
jimmy
gone
in
for
loaded
an
ore
boat
with
avgas
and
ammo
and
ran
it
up
the
seaway
if
anybody
in
syndic
territory
gave
a
damn
they
thought
it
was
a
load
of
ore
for
new
orleans
via
the
atlantic
and
the
gulf
but
jimmy
ran
his
load
to
ireland
or
iceland
a
little
private
flier
of
his
he
would
dare
harm
us
there
the
treaty
and
you
a
falcaro
treaty
she
said
i
tell
you
they
all
in
it
now
that
i
seen
the
government
in
action
i
understand
what
i
saw
in
mob
territory
they
gone
rotten
that
all
they
gone
rotten
the
way
he
treated
you
because
he
thought
you
did
have
his
rank
sometimes
my
sometimes
he
tells
a
person
off
sometimes
he
lets
him
know
he
top
man
in
the
syndic
and
does
propose
to
let
anybody
teach
him
how
to
suck
eggs
but
the
spirit
different
in
the
syndic
it
parent
to
child
in
the
mob
it
master
to
slave
not
based
on
age
not
based
on
achievement
but
based
on
the
accident
of
birth
you
tell
me
a
falcaro
and
that
packs
weight
why
not
because
i
was
born
a
falcaro
but
because
they
let
me
stay
a
falcaro
if
i
had
been
brainy
and
quick
they
have
adopted
me
out
before
i
was
ten
they
do
do
that
in
mob
territory
whatever
chance
sends
a
regan
is
a
regan
then
and
forever
even
if
it
a
paranoid
constitutional
inferior
like
father
even
if
it
a
giggling
pervert
like
jimmy
god
charles
i
scared
at
last
i
know
these
people
and
i
scared
you
have
to
see
chicago
to
know
why
the
lakefront
palaces
finer
than
anything
in
new
york
regan
memorial
plaza
finer
than
scratch
sheet
square
great
gilded
marble
figures
a
hundred
running
yards
of
heroic
frieze
but
the
hovels
you
see
only
by
chance
gray
brick
towers
dating
from
the
third
fire
the
children
with
faces
like
weasels
the
men
with
faces
like
hogs
the
women
with
figures
like
beer
barrels
and
all
of
them
glaring
at
you
when
you
drive
past
as
if
they
could
cut
your
throat
with
joy
i
never
understood
the
look
in
their
eyes
until
now
and
you
never
begin
to
understand
what
i
talking
about
until
you
see
their
eyes
charles
revolted
against
the
idea
it
was
too
gross
to
go
down
it
did
square
with
his
acquired
picture
of
life
in
north
america
and
therefore
lee
falcaro
must
be
somehow
mistaken
or
hysterical
there
he
murmured
stroking
her
hair
we
be
all
right
we
be
all
right
he
tried
to
soothe
her
she
twisted
out
of
his
arms
and
raged
i
be
humored
mad
i
tell
you
dick
reiner
was
right
we
got
to
wipe
out
the
government
but
frank
taylor
was
right
too
we
got
to
blast
the
mob
before
they
blast
us
they
died
and
decayed
into
something
too
horrible
to
bear
if
we
let
them
stay
on
the
continent
with
us
their
stink
will
infect
us
and
poison
us
to
death
we
got
to
do
something
we
got
to
do
something
what
it
stopped
her
cold
after
a
minute
she
uttered
a
shaky
laugh
the
fat
sloppy
happy
syndic
she
said
sitting
around
while
the
wolves
overseas
and
the
maniacs
across
the
mississippi
are
waiting
to
jump
yes
do
what
charles
orsino
was
not
good
at
arguments
or
indeed
at
any
abstract
thinking
he
knew
it
he
knew
the
virtues
that
had
commended
him
to
taylor
were
his
energy
and
an
talent
for
getting
along
with
people
but
something
rang
terribly
false
in
lee
words
that
kind
of
thinking
does
get
you
anywhere
lee
he
said
slowly
i
did
absorb
much
from
uncle
frank
but
i
did
absorb
this
you
run
into
trouble
if
you
make
up
stories
about
the
world
and
then
act
as
if
they
true
the
syndic
is
somebody
sitting
around
the
government
is
wolves
the
mobsters
are
maniacs
and
they
are
waiting
to
jump
on
the
syndic
the
syndic
is
anything
that
jumpable
it
some
people
and
their
morale
and
credit
faith
is
a
beautiful
thing
lee
falcaro
said
bitterly
where
you
get
yours
from
the
people
i
knew
and
worked
with
bookies
sluts
decent
citizens
and
what
about
the
scared
and
unhappy
ones
in
riveredge
that
sow
of
a
woman
in
the
who
smuggled
me
aboard
a
coast
raider
the
neurotics
and
psychotics
i
found
more
and
more
of
when
i
invalidated
the
lieberman
findings
charles
the
north
american
government
did
scare
me
especially
but
the
thought
that
they
lined
up
with
a
continental
power
does
it
scares
me
damnably
because
it
be
three
against
one
against
the
syndic
the
mob
the
government
and
our
own
unbalanced
citizens
uncle
frank
never
let
that
word
citizens
pass
without
a
tirade
we
are
not
a
government
he
always
yelled
we
are
not
a
government
we
must
not
think
like
a
government
we
must
not
think
in
terms
of
duties
and
receipts
and
disbursements
we
must
think
in
terms
of
the
old
loyalties
that
bound
the
syndic
together
uncle
frank
was
sedentary
but
he
had
roused
himself
once
to
the
point
of
wrecking
a
bright
young
man
newly
installed
bookkeeping
system
for
the
medical
center
he
had
used
a
cane
most
enthusiastically
and
then
bellowed
the
next
wise
guy
who
tries
to
sneak
into
this
joint
will
get
them
down
his
throat
what
the
hell
do
we
need
for
either
room
enough
and
doctors
enough
for
the
patients
or
there
is
if
there
is
we
take
care
of
them
if
there
is
we
put
in
an
ambulance
and
take
them
someplace
else
and
if
i
hear
one
goddammed
word
about
he
glared
the
rest
and
strode
out
puffing
and
leaning
on
charles
arm
efficiency
he
growled
in
the
corridor
every
so
often
a
wise
guy
comes
to
me
whimpering
that
people
are
getting
away
with
murder
collections
are
ten
per
cent
below
what
they
ought
to
be
the
falcaro
fund
being
milked
because
fifteen
per
cent
of
the
dough
goes
to
people
who
are
in
need
at
all
eight
per
cent
of
the
people
getting
pensions
are
really
past
sixty
get
efficient
these
people
tell
me
save
money
by
collections
save
money
by
tightening
up
the
fund
rules
save
money
by
a
nice
big
system
so
we
can
check
on
pensioners
yeah
have
people
who
might
be
check
on
collections
instead
and
make
enemies
to
boot
whenever
we
catch
somebody
short
make
the
fund
a
grudging
scrooge
instead
of
an
and
let
people
about
their
chances
of
making
the
fund
instead
of
it
take
care
of
them
if
they
caught
short
set
up
a
vital
statistics
system
from
birth
to
death
with
numbers
and
and
house
registration
and
maybe
the
if
you
forget
to
report
a
change
of
address
you
know
what
wrong
with
the
wise
guys
charles
constipation
and
they
want
to
constipate
the
universe
charles
remembered
his
uncle
restored
to
chuckling
good
humor
by
the
time
he
had
finished
embroidering
his
theory
with
elaborate
scatological
details
the
syndic
will
stand
he
said
to
lee
falcaro
thinking
of
his
uncle
who
knew
what
he
was
doing
thinking
of
edward
falcaro
who
did
the
right
thing
without
knowing
why
thinking
of
his
good
friends
in
the
precinct
the
roaring
happy
crowds
in
scratch
sheet
square
the
men
of
riveredge
breakdown
station
who
had
borne
with
his
sullenness
and
intolerance
simply
because
that
was
the
way
things
were
and
that
was
the
way
you
acted
i
do
know
what
the
mob
up
to
and
i
got
a
shock
from
the
government
and
i
do
deny
that
we
have
a
few
miserable
people
who
ca
seem
to
be
helped
but
you
seen
too
much
of
the
mob
and
government
and
our
abnormals
maybe
you
do
know
as
much
as
you
should
about
our
ordinary
people
anyway
all
we
can
do
is
wait
yes
she
said
all
we
can
do
is
wait
until
chicago
we
have
each
other
xviii
they
were
too
sick
with
gasoline
fumes
to
count
the
passing
hours
or
days
food
was
brought
to
them
from
time
to
time
but
it
tasted
like
avgas
they
could
not
think
for
the
sick
headaches
that
pounded
incessantly
behind
their
eyes
when
lee
developed
vomiting
spasms
that
would
not
stop
charles
orsino
pounded
on
the
bulkhead
with
his
fists
and
yelled
his
voice
thunderous
in
the
metal
compartment
for
an
hour
somebody
came
at
last
regan
the
light
stabbed
charles
eyes
when
he
opened
the
door
trouble
regan
asked
smirking
miss
falcaro
may
be
dying
charles
said
his
own
throat
felt
as
though
it
had
been
gone
over
with
a
cobbler
rasp
i
do
have
to
tell
you
your
life
wo
be
worth
a
dime
if
she
dies
and
it
gets
back
to
syndic
territory
she
got
to
be
moved
and
she
got
to
have
medical
attention
death
threat
from
the
dago
regan
was
amused
i
have
it
on
your
own
testimony
that
the
syndic
is
merely
morale
and
people
and
credit
not
a
formidable
organization
yes
there
was
a
mike
in
here
one
reason
for
your
discomfort
you
be
gratified
to
learn
that
i
thought
most
of
your
conversation
decidedly
dull
however
the
lady
will
be
of
no
use
to
us
dead
and
we
now
in
the
seaway
entering
lake
michigan
i
suppose
it
ca
do
any
harm
to
move
you
two
pick
her
up
will
you
i
let
you
lead
the
way
and
i
remind
you
that
i
may
not
as
the
lady
said
be
a
polo
player
but
i
am
a
high
expert
with
the
handgun
get
moving
charles
did
not
think
he
could
pick
his
own
feet
up
but
the
thought
of
pleading
weakness
to
regan
was
unbearable
he
could
try
staggering
he
got
lee
falcaro
over
his
shoulder
and
through
the
door
regan
courteously
stood
aside
and
murmured
straight
ahead
and
up
the
ramp
i
giving
you
my
own
cabin
we
be
docking
soon
enough
i
make
out
charles
dropped
her
onto
a
sybaritic
bed
in
a
small
but
cabin
regan
whistled
up
a
deckhand
and
a
officer
of
some
sort
who
arrived
with
a
medicine
chest
do
what
you
can
for
her
mister
he
told
the
officer
and
to
the
deckhand
just
watch
them
they
are
to
touch
anything
if
they
give
you
trouble
you
free
to
punch
them
around
a
bit
he
left
whistling
the
officer
fussed
unhappily
over
the
medicine
chest
and
stalled
by
sponging
off
lee
falcaro
face
and
throat
the
deckhand
watched
impassively
he
was
a
and
he
had
spent
days
inhaling
fumes
the
pounding
behind
charles
eyes
seemed
to
be
worsening
with
the
fresher
air
he
collapsed
into
a
seat
and
croaked
with
shut
eyes
while
you
trying
to
figure
out
the
vomiting
can
i
have
a
handful
of
aspirins
eh
nothing
was
said
about
you
you
were
in
number
three
with
her
i
suppose
it
be
all
right
here
he
poured
a
dozen
tablets
into
charles
hand
get
him
some
water
you
the
deckhand
brought
a
glass
of
water
from
the
adjoining
lavatory
and
charles
washed
down
some
of
the
tablets
the
officer
was
reading
a
booklet
worry
written
on
his
face
do
you
know
any
medicine
he
finally
asked
the
ache
was
beginning
to
diffuse
through
charles
head
more
general
now
and
less
excruciating
he
felt
deliciously
sleepy
but
roused
himself
to
answer
some
athletic
trainer
stuff
i
do
know
morphine
curare
the
officer
ruffled
through
the
booklet
nothing
about
vomiting
he
said
but
it
says
curare
for
muscular
cramp
and
i
guess
that
going
on
a
lipoid
suspension
to
release
it
slowly
into
the
bloodstream
and
give
the
irritation
time
to
subside
anyway
i
ca
kill
her
if
i
watch
the
dose
charles
through
eyes
saw
lee
falcaro
arm
reach
behind
the
officer
back
to
his
medicine
chest
the
deckhand
eyes
were
turning
to
the
bed
charles
heaved
himself
to
his
feet
skyrockets
going
off
again
through
his
head
and
started
for
the
lavatory
the
deckhand
grabbed
his
arm
rest
mister
where
do
you
think
you
going
another
glass
of
water
get
it
you
heard
my
orders
charles
subsided
when
he
dared
to
look
again
lee
arm
lay
alongside
her
body
and
the
officer
was
dosages
in
his
booklet
against
a
pressurized
hypodermic
spray
the
officer
sighed
and
addressed
lee
you
wo
even
feel
this
relax
he
read
his
setting
on
the
spray
again
checked
it
again
against
the
booklet
he
touched
the
syringe
to
the
skin
of
lee
arm
and
thumbed
open
the
valve
it
hissed
for
a
moment
and
charles
knew
submicroscopic
particles
of
the
medication
had
been
blasted
under
lee
skin
too
fast
for
nerves
to
register
the
shock
his
glass
of
water
came
and
he
gulped
it
greedily
the
officer
packed
the
pressurized
syringe
away
folded
the
chest
and
said
to
both
of
them
rather
vaguely
that
should
do
it
if
uh
if
anything
happens
or
if
it
does
work
call
me
and
i
try
something
else
morphine
maybe
he
left
and
charles
slumped
in
the
chair
the
pain
ebbing
and
sleep
beginning
to
flow
over
him
not
yet
he
told
himself
she
hooked
something
from
the
chest
he
said
to
the
deckhand
can
i
clean
the
lady
and
myself
up
go
ahead
mister
you
can
use
it
just
do
try
anything
the
man
lounged
in
the
of
the
lavatory
alternately
studying
charles
at
the
and
lee
on
the
bed
charles
took
off
a
heavy
layer
of
oily
grease
from
himself
and
then
took
washing
tissues
to
the
bed
lee
falcaro
spasms
were
tapering
off
as
he
washed
her
she
managed
a
smile
and
an
unmistakable
wink
you
folks
married
the
deckhand
asked
no
charles
said
weakly
she
held
up
her
right
arm
for
the
washing
tissue
as
he
scrubbed
the
hand
he
felt
a
small
cylinder
smoothly
transferred
from
her
palm
to
his
he
slid
it
into
a
pocket
and
finished
the
job
the
officer
popped
in
again
with
a
carton
of
milk
any
better
miss
he
asked
yes
she
whispered
good
try
to
drink
this
immensely
set
up
by
his
success
in
treatment
he
hovered
over
her
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
getting
the
milk
down
a
sip
at
a
time
it
stayed
down
he
left
trailing
a
favorable
prognosis
meanwhile
charles
had
covertly
examined
lee
booty
a
pressurized
syringe
labeled
sulfate
it
was
full
and
ready
he
cracked
off
the
protective
cap
and
waited
his
chance
it
came
when
lee
grimaced
at
him
and
called
the
deckhand
in
a
feeble
murmur
she
continued
to
murmur
so
indistinctly
that
he
bent
over
trying
to
catch
the
words
charles
leaned
forward
and
emptied
the
syringe
at
one
inch
range
into
the
taut
seat
of
the
deckhand
pants
he
scratched
absently
and
said
to
lee
you
have
to
talk
up
lady
then
he
giggled
looked
bewildered
and
collapsed
on
the
floor
staring
coked
to
the
eyebrows
lee
painfully
sat
up
on
the
bed
porthole
she
said
charles
went
to
it
and
struggled
with
the
locking
lugs
it
opened
and
an
alarm
bell
began
to
clang
through
the
ship
he
saw
the
broken
wire
an
alarm
feet
thundered
outside
and
the
glutinous
voice
of
jimmy
regan
was
heard
wait
you
damn
fools
you
in
there
is
everything
all
right
did
they
try
to
pull
something
charles
kept
silent
and
shook
his
head
at
the
girl
he
picked
up
a
chair
and
stood
by
the
door
the
glutinous
voice
again
in
a
mumble
that
did
carry
through
and
the
door
sprang
open
charles
brought
the
chair
down
in
a
murderous
chop
conscious
only
that
it
seemed
curiously
light
there
was
an
impact
and
the
head
fell
it
was
regan
with
a
drawn
gun
it
had
been
regan
his
skull
was
smashed
before
he
knew
it
charles
felt
as
though
he
had
all
the
time
in
the
world
he
picked
up
the
gun
to
a
confused
roar
like
a
sound
track
and
emptied
it
into
the
corridor
it
had
been
a
full
automatic
but
the
fifteen
shots
seemed
as
as
a
ceremonial
salute
regan
in
his
vanity
wore
two
guns
charles
scooped
up
the
other
and
said
to
lee
come
on
he
knew
she
was
following
as
he
raced
down
the
cleared
corridor
and
down
the
ramp
back
to
the
compartment
in
which
they
had
been
locked
red
danger
lights
burned
on
the
walls
charles
flipped
the
pistol
to
as
they
passed
a
bulkhead
with
valves
and
gages
sprouting
from
it
he
turned
and
fired
three
deliberate
shots
into
it
the
last
was
drowned
out
by
a
dull
roar
as
gasoline
fumes
exploded
pipe
fittings
and
fragments
of
plate
whizzed
about
them
like
bullets
as
they
raced
on
somebody
ahead
loomed
yelling
querulously
what
the
hell
was
that
mac
what
blew
where
the
reactor
room
charles
demanded
jamming
the
pistol
into
his
chest
the
man
gulped
and
pointed
take
me
there
fast
now
mac
charles
told
him
in
a
few
incisive
details
where
and
how
he
was
going
to
be
shot
the
man
went
white
and
led
them
down
the
corridor
and
into
the
reactor
room
three
men
with
the
aloof
look
of
reactor
specialists
stared
at
them
as
they
bulled
into
the
spotless
chamber
the
oldest
sniffed
and
what
may
i
ask
are
you
crewmen
doing
in
lee
slammed
the
door
behind
them
and
said
sound
the
radiation
alarm
certainly
not
you
must
be
the
couple
we
the
radiation
she
picked
up
a
pair
of
dividers
from
the
plot
board
and
approached
the
technician
with
murder
on
her
face
he
gaped
until
she
poised
the
needle
points
before
his
eyes
and
repeated
the
radiation
nobody
in
the
room
including
charles
had
the
slightest
doubt
that
the
points
would
sink
into
the
eyeballs
if
he
refused
do
what
she
says
will
he
mumbled
his
eyes
crossing
on
the
dividers
for
god
sake
do
what
she
says
she
crazy
one
of
the
men
moved
very
cautiously
watching
charles
and
the
gun
to
a
red
handle
and
pulled
it
down
a
barrier
rose
to
wall
off
the
chamber
and
the
wail
of
a
standard
radioactivity
warning
began
to
howl
mournfully
through
the
ship
dump
the
reactor
metal
charles
said
his
eyes
searched
for
the
exit
and
found
it
a
breakaway
panel
standard
for
a
hot
lab
a
technician
wailed
we
do
that
we
ca
that
a
million
bucks
of
thorium
with
a
hundred
years
of
life
in
it
have
a
heart
mister
they
crucify
us
they
can
dredge
for
it
charles
said
dump
the
metal
dump
the
metal
lee
said
she
had
moved
the
senior
technician
eyes
were
still
on
the
bright
needle
points
he
was
crying
silently
dump
it
he
said
okay
chief
your
responsibility
remember
dump
it
wailed
the
senior
the
technician
did
something
technical
at
the
control
board
after
a
moment
the
steady
rumbling
of
the
turbines
ceased
and
the
ship
deck
began
to
wallow
underfoot
hit
the
panel
lee
charles
said
she
did
running
he
followed
her
through
the
oval
port
it
was
like
an
diving
bell
welded
to
the
hull
there
were
large
luminous
cleats
for
pulling
yourself
down
through
the
water
under
the
rim
of
the
bell
he
dropped
the
pistol
into
the
water
breathed
deeply
a
couple
of
times
and
began
to
climb
down
there
was
no
sign
of
lee
he
kicked
up
through
the
dark
water
on
a
long
slant
away
from
the
ship
it
might
be
worse
with
a
fire
and
a
alarm
and
a
dead
chief
aboard
the
crew
would
have
things
on
their
mind
besides
looking
for
bobbing
heads
he
broke
the
surface
and
treaded
water
to
make
a
minimum
target
he
did
not
turn
to
the
ship
his
dark
hair
would
be
less
visible
than
his
white
face
and
if
he
was
going
to
get
a
burst
of
bullets
through
either
he
did
want
to
know
about
it
ahead
he
saw
lee
blonde
hair
spread
on
the
water
for
a
moment
and
then
it
vanished
he
breathed
hugely
ducked
and
swam
under
water
toward
it
when
he
rose
next
a
sheet
of
flame
was
lightening
the
sky
and
the
oily
reek
of
burning
hydrocarbons
tainted
the
air
he
dove
again
and
this
time
caught
up
with
lee
her
face
was
and
her
eyes
blank
where
she
was
drawing
her
strength
from
he
could
not
guess
behind
them
the
ship
sent
up
an
oily
plume
and
the
wail
of
the
radioactivity
warning
could
be
faintly
heard
before
them
a
dim
shore
stretched
he
gripped
her
naked
arm
roughened
by
the
march
waters
of
lake
michigan
bent
it
around
his
neck
and
struck
off
for
the
shore
his
lungs
were
bursting
in
his
chest
and
the
world
was
turning
before
his
burning
eyes
he
heaved
his
tired
arm
through
the
water
as
though
each
stroke
would
be
his
last
but
the
last
stroke
by
some
miracle
never
was
the
last
xix
it
had
been
easy
to
get
time
off
from
the
factory
ken
oliver
was
a
little
late
when
he
slid
into
the
waiting
room
of
the
michigan
city
medical
center
a
parabolic
mike
in
the
ceiling
trained
itself
on
the
heat
he
radiated
and
followed
him
across
the
floor
to
a
chair
a
canned
voice
said
state
your
business
please
he
started
a
little
and
said
in
the
general
direction
of
the
mike
ken
oliver
a
figure
man
in
the
blue
department
picasso
oils
and
etching
corporation
latham
sent
me
here
for
what
do
you
call
it
a
biopsy
thank
you
please
be
seated
he
smiled
because
he
was
seated
already
and
picked
up
a
magazine
the
current
copy
of
the
sporting
familiarly
known
as
the
green
sheet
everybody
in
mob
territory
read
it
the
fingers
of
the
blind
spelled
out
its
optimism
and
its
selections
at
hawthorne
in
braille
if
you
were
not
only
blind
but
fingerless
there
was
a
talking
edition
that
read
itself
aloud
to
you
from
tape
he
riffled
through
the
past
performances
and
selections
to
the
articles
this
month
lead
was
god
i
am
dying
of
throat
he
leaned
back
in
the
chair
dizzily
the
waiting
room
becoming
gray
mist
around
him
he
thought
it
could
be
that
all
it
could
be
was
a
little
sore
on
the
back
of
his
throat
no
more
than
that
just
a
little
sore
on
the
back
of
his
throat
he
been
a
fool
to
go
to
latham
the
fees
were
outrageous
and
he
was
behind
always
a
little
behind
on
his
bills
but
cancer
so
much
of
it
around
and
the
drugs
did
seem
to
any
more
but
latham
had
almost
promised
him
it
was
oliver
the
loudspeaker
said
please
go
to
riordan
office
number
ten
riordan
was
younger
than
he
that
was
supposed
to
be
bad
in
a
general
practitioner
good
in
a
specialist
and
riordan
was
a
specialist
pathology
a
young
specialist
good
morning
sit
here
open
your
mouth
wider
than
that
and
relax
your
glottis
is
locked
oliver
could
protest
around
the
taste
of
the
tongue
depressor
there
was
a
sudden
coldness
and
a
metallic
that
startled
him
greatly
then
riordan
took
the
splint
out
of
his
mouth
and
ignored
him
as
he
summoned
somebody
over
his
desk
set
a
young
man
even
younger
than
riordan
came
in
freeze
section
and
stain
this
right
away
the
pathologist
said
handing
him
a
forceps
from
which
a
small
blob
dangled
have
them
send
up
the
rotino
charts
three
hundred
to
nine
hundred
inclusive
he
began
to
fill
out
charts
still
ignoring
oliver
who
sat
and
sweated
bullets
for
ten
minutes
then
he
left
and
was
back
in
five
minutes
more
you
got
it
he
said
shortly
it
operable
and
you
wo
lose
much
tissue
he
scribbled
on
a
sheet
of
paper
and
handed
it
to
oliver
the
painter
numbly
read
anterior
epithelioma
metastases
giant
cells
riordan
was
talking
again
give
this
to
latham
it
my
report
have
him
line
up
a
surgeon
as
to
the
operation
i
say
the
sooner
the
better
unless
you
care
to
lose
your
larynx
that
will
be
fifty
dollars
fifty
dollars
the
painter
said
blankly
but
latham
told
me
he
trailed
off
and
got
out
his
check
book
only
in
the
account
but
he
would
deposit
his
paycheck
today
which
would
bring
it
up
it
was
after
three
so
his
check
would
go
in
today
he
wrote
out
the
slip
slowly
and
carefully
riordan
took
it
read
it
suspiciously
put
it
away
and
said
good
day
mr
oliver
oliver
wandered
from
the
medical
center
into
the
business
heart
of
the
art
colony
the
van
gogh
works
on
the
left
must
have
snagged
the
big
order
from
mexico
their
chimneys
were
going
full
blast
and
the
reek
of
linseed
oil
and
turps
was
strong
in
the
air
but
the
poor
beggars
on
the
line
at
rembrandts
across
the
square
were
out
of
luck
they
been
laid
off
for
a
month
now
with
no
sign
of
a
work
call
yet
somebody
jostled
him
off
the
sidewalk
somebody
in
a
great
hurry
oliver
sighed
the
place
was
getting
more
like
chicago
every
day
he
sometimes
thought
he
had
made
art
his
line
not
because
he
had
any
special
talent
but
because
artists
were
relatively
people
not
so
quick
to
pop
you
in
the
nose
not
such
aggressive
drunks
when
they
drunks
quit
the
stalling
a
thin
cold
voice
inside
him
said
get
over
to
latham
the
man
said
the
sooner
the
better
he
went
over
to
latham
whose
waiting
room
was
crowded
with
irascible
women
after
an
hour
he
got
to
see
the
old
man
and
hand
him
the
slip
latham
said
do
worry
about
a
thing
riordan
a
good
man
if
he
says
it
operable
it
operable
now
we
want
finsen
to
do
the
whittling
with
finsen
operating
you
wo
have
to
worry
about
a
thing
he
a
good
man
his
fee
fifteen
hundred
oh
my
god
oliver
gulped
what
the
matter
have
you
got
it
to
his
surprise
and
terror
oliver
found
himself
giving
latham
a
hysterical
stump
speech
about
how
he
did
have
it
and
who
did
have
it
and
how
could
anybody
get
ahead
with
the
way
prices
were
shooting
up
and
everybody
gouged
you
every
time
you
turned
around
and
yes
that
went
for
doctors
too
and
if
you
did
get
a
couple
of
bucks
in
your
pocket
the
salesmen
heard
about
it
and
battered
at
you
until
you
put
down
an
installment
on
some
piece
of
junk
you
did
want
to
get
them
out
of
your
hair
and
what
the
hell
kind
of
world
was
this
anyway
latham
listened
smiling
and
nodding
with
as
oliver
finally
realized
his
hearing
aid
turned
off
his
voice
ran
down
and
latham
said
briskly
all
right
then
you
just
come
around
when
you
arranged
the
financial
details
and
i
contact
finsen
he
a
good
man
you
have
to
worry
about
a
thing
and
remember
the
sooner
the
better
oliver
slumped
out
of
the
office
and
went
straight
to
the
mob
building
office
of
the
regan
benevolent
fund
an
woman
there
turned
him
down
indignantly
you
should
be
ashamed
of
yourself
trying
to
draw
on
the
fund
when
there
are
people
in
actual
want
who
ca
be
accommodated
no
i
do
want
to
hear
any
more
about
it
if
you
please
there
are
others
waiting
waiting
for
what
the
same
treatment
oliver
realized
with
a
shock
that
he
had
phoned
his
foreman
as
promised
and
it
was
four
minutes
to
five
he
did
a
dance
of
agonized
impatience
outside
a
telephone
booth
occupied
by
a
fat
woman
she
noticed
him
pursed
her
lips
hung
up
and
stayed
in
the
booth
she
began
a
slow
search
of
her
found
coins
and
slowly
dialed
a
new
number
she
gave
him
a
malevolent
grin
as
he
walked
away
crushed
he
had
a
good
job
record
but
that
was
no
way
to
keep
it
good
one
black
mark
another
black
mark
and
one
day
bingo
general
advances
was
open
of
course
through
its
window
you
could
see
handsome
young
men
and
sleek
young
women
just
waiting
to
help
you
whatever
the
fiscal
jam
he
went
in
and
was
whisked
to
a
booth
where
a
blonde
oozed
sympathy
over
him
he
walked
out
with
a
check
for
fifteen
hundred
dollars
after
signing
countless
papers
with
the
creamy
hand
of
the
girl
on
his
to
help
guide
the
pen
what
was
printed
on
the
papers
god
and
general
advances
alone
knew
there
were
men
on
the
line
who
told
him
with
resignation
that
they
had
been
paying
off
to
for
the
better
part
of
their
lives
there
were
men
who
said
bitterly
that
was
owned
by
the
regan
benevolent
fund
which
must
be
a
lie
the
street
was
full
of
people
strangers
who
did
look
like
your
artist
muscle
men
with
the
chicago
style
and
if
anybody
got
one
in
the
gut
too
goddamned
bad
about
it
they
were
peering
into
faces
as
they
passed
he
was
frightened
he
stepped
onto
the
slidewalk
and
hurried
home
hoping
for
temporary
peace
there
but
there
was
no
peace
for
his
frayed
nerves
the
apartment
house
door
opened
obediently
when
he
told
it
regan
but
the
elevator
stood
stupidly
still
when
he
said
seventh
floor
he
spat
bitterly
and
precisely
the
doors
closed
on
him
with
a
faintly
derisive
pneumatic
moan
and
he
was
whisked
up
to
the
eighth
floor
he
walked
down
wearily
and
said
cobalt
blue
to
his
own
door
after
a
furtive
look
up
and
down
the
hall
it
worked
and
he
went
to
his
phone
to
flash
latham
but
did
oliver
sank
instead
into
a
pneumatic
chair
his
hawthorne
electric
stepsaver
door
mike
following
him
with
its
mindless
snout
he
punched
a
button
on
the
chair
and
the
selected
a
random
tape
a
long
pure
melodic
trumpet
line
filled
the
room
it
died
for
two
beats
and
than
the
strings
and
woodwinds
picked
it
up
and
tossed
it
oliver
snapped
off
the
music
sweat
starting
from
his
brow
it
was
the
gershwin
and
he
remembered
how
gershwin
had
died
there
had
been
a
little
nodule
in
his
brain
as
there
was
a
little
nodule
in
oliver
throat
time
the
great
kidder
the
years
drifted
by
suddenly
you
were
running
to
the
medics
for
this
and
that
suddenly
they
told
you
to
have
your
throat
whittled
out
or
die
disgustingly
and
what
did
you
have
to
show
for
it
a
number
a
travel
pass
a
payment
book
from
general
advance
a
bunch
of
junk
you
never
wanted
a
job
that
was
a
heavier
ball
and
chain
than
any
convict
ever
wore
in
the
barbarous
days
of
government
was
this
what
regan
and
falcaro
had
bled
for
he
defrosted
some
hamburger
fried
it
and
ate
it
and
then
went
mechanically
down
to
the
tavern
he
did
like
to
drink
every
night
but
you
had
to
be
one
of
the
boys
or
word
would
get
back
to
the
plant
and
you
might
be
on
your
way
to
another
black
mark
they
were
racing
under
the
lights
at
hawthorne
too
and
he
be
expected
to
put
a
couple
of
bucks
down
he
never
seemed
to
win
nobody
he
knew
ever
seemed
to
win
not
at
the
horses
not
at
the
craps
table
not
at
the
numbers
he
stood
outside
the
saloon
for
a
long
moment
and
then
turned
and
walked
into
the
darkness
away
from
town
possessed
by
impulses
he
did
not
understand
or
want
to
understand
he
had
only
a
vague
hope
that
standing
on
the
dunes
and
looking
out
across
the
dark
lake
might
somehow
soothe
him
in
half
an
hour
he
had
reached
the
deciduous
forest
then
the
pine
then
the
scrubby
brushes
then
the
grasses
then
the
bare
white
sand
and
lying
in
it
he
found
two
people
a
man
so
hard
and
dark
he
seemed
to
be
carved
from
oak
and
a
woman
so
white
and
gaunt
she
seemed
to
be
carved
from
ivory
he
turned
shyly
from
the
woman
are
you
all
right
he
asked
the
man
is
there
anything
i
can
do
the
man
opened
eyes
better
leave
us
alone
he
said
only
get
you
into
trouble
oliver
laughed
hysterically
trouble
he
said
do
think
of
it
the
man
seemed
to
be
measuring
him
with
his
eyes
and
said
at
last
you
better
go
and
not
talk
about
us
we
enemies
of
the
mob
oliver
said
after
a
pause
so
am
i
do
go
away
i
be
back
with
some
clothes
and
food
for
you
and
the
lady
then
i
can
help
you
to
my
place
i
an
enemy
of
the
mob
too
i
just
never
knew
it
until
now
he
started
off
and
then
turned
you
wo
go
away
i
mean
it
i
want
to
help
you
i
ca
seem
to
help
myself
but
perhaps
there
something
the
man
said
tiredly
we
wo
go
away
oliver
hurried
off
there
was
something
mingled
with
the
scent
of
the
pine
forest
tonight
he
was
home
before
he
identified
it
oil
smoke
xx
lee
swore
and
said
i
can
get
up
if
i
want
to
you
stay
in
bed
whether
you
want
to
or
not
charles
told
her
you
a
sick
woman
i
a
very
woman
and
that
means
i
convalescent
ask
anybody
i
go
right
out
into
the
street
and
do
that
darling
she
got
out
of
bed
and
wrapped
oliver
dressing
gown
around
her
hungry
again
she
said
he
be
back
soon
you
left
nothing
but
some
frozen
worms
looks
like
shall
i
defrost
them
please
do
trouble
i
can
wait
window
he
snapped
she
ducked
back
and
swore
again
this
time
at
herself
sorry
she
said
which
will
do
us
a
whole
hell
of
a
lot
of
good
if
somebody
saw
me
and
started
wondering
oliver
came
in
with
packages
lee
kissed
him
and
he
grinned
shyly
trout
he
whispered
she
grabbed
the
packages
and
flew
to
the
kitchenette
the
way
to
lee
falcaro
heart
charles
mused
how
your
throat
ken
no
pain
today
oliver
whispered
latham
says
i
can
talk
as
much
as
i
like
and
i
got
things
to
talk
about
he
opened
his
coat
and
hauled
out
a
flat
package
that
had
been
stuffed
under
his
belt
stolen
from
the
factory
brushes
pens
tubes
of
ink
drawing
instruments
my
friends
you
are
going
to
return
to
syndic
territory
in
style
with
passes
and
permits
galore
lee
returned
trout
frying
she
said
i
heard
that
about
the
passes
are
you
you
can
fake
them
his
face
fell
eight
years
at
the
chicago
art
institute
he
whispered
three
years
at
original
reproductions
eleven
years
at
picasso
oils
and
etchings
where
i
am
now
third
figure
man
in
the
blue
department
i
really
think
i
deserve
your
confidence
ken
we
trust
and
love
you
if
it
were
for
the
difference
in
your
ages
i
marry
you
charles
now
what
about
the
chicagoans
hold
it
the
fish
dinner
was
served
and
cleared
away
before
they
could
get
more
out
of
oliver
his
throat
was
ready
for
more
than
one
job
at
a
time
he
told
them
at
last
things
are
quieting
down
there
are
still
some
strangers
in
town
and
the
road
patrols
are
still
acting
very
but
nobody
been
pulled
in
today
somebody
told
me
on
the
line
that
the
whole
business
is
a
lot
of
foolishness
he
said
the
ship
must
have
been
damaged
by
somebody
stupidity
and
regan
must
have
been
killed
in
a
brawl
everybody
knows
he
was
half
crazy
like
his
father
so
my
friend
figures
they
made
up
the
story
about
two
wild
europeans
to
cover
up
a
mess
i
said
i
thought
there
was
a
lot
in
what
he
said
oliver
laughed
silently
good
man
charles
tried
not
to
act
when
do
you
think
you
can
start
on
the
passes
ken
oliver
face
dropped
a
little
tonight
he
whispered
i
suppose
the
first
couple
of
tries
will
be
any
good
so
let
go
lee
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
we
miss
you
too
she
said
but
do
ever
forget
this
we
coming
back
hell
wo
stop
us
coming
back
oliver
was
arranging
stolen
instruments
on
the
table
you
have
a
big
order
he
whispered
sadly
i
guess
you
are
afraid
of
it
because
you
always
been
rich
and
strong
anything
you
want
to
do
you
think
you
can
do
but
those
government
people
and
after
them
the
mob
maybe
it
would
be
better
if
you
just
let
things
take
their
course
lee
found
out
a
person
can
be
happy
even
here
we
coming
back
lee
said
oliver
took
out
his
own
michigan
travel
permit
as
always
the
sight
of
it
made
charles
wince
americans
under
such
a
yoke
oliver
whispered
i
got
a
good
long
look
today
at
a
michigan
city
buffalo
permit
the
foreman
he
buys
turps
from
carolina
at
buffalo
i
sketched
it
from
memory
as
soon
as
i
got
by
myself
i
do
swear
to
it
not
yet
but
i
have
the
sketch
to
practice
from
and
i
can
get
a
few
more
looks
later
he
pinned
down
the
drawing
paper
licked
a
ruling
pen
and
filled
it
and
began
to
copy
the
border
of
his
own
pass
i
do
suppose
anything
i
can
do
lee
asked
you
can
turn
on
the
audio
oliver
whispered
they
have
it
going
all
the
time
at
the
shop
i
do
feel
right
working
unless
there
some
music
driving
me
out
of
my
mind
lee
turned
on
the
big
hawthorne
electric
set
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
imbecillic
music
filled
the
air
and
oliver
grunted
and
settled
down
lee
and
charles
listened
fingers
entwined
to
half
an
hour
of
slushy
ballads
while
oliver
worked
the
news
period
announcer
came
on
with
some
anesthetic
trial
verdicts
sports
results
and
society
notes
about
which
regan
had
gone
where
then
the
local
mobsters
of
michigan
city
indiana
today
welcomed
maurice
regan
to
their
town
regan
will
assume
direction
of
efforts
to
apprehend
the
two
european
savages
who
murdered
james
regan
iv
last
month
aboard
the
ore
boat
john
in
waters
off
michigan
city
you
probably
remember
that
the
europeans
did
some
damage
to
the
reactor
room
before
they
fled
from
the
ship
how
they
boarded
the
ship
and
their
present
whereabouts
are
mysteries
but
they
probably
wo
be
mysteries
long
maurice
regan
is
to
the
public
but
he
has
built
an
enviable
record
in
the
administration
of
the
chicago
police
department
regan
on
taking
charge
of
the
case
said
this
know
by
traces
found
on
the
dunes
that
they
got
away
we
know
from
the
logs
of
highway
patrols
that
they
did
get
out
of
the
michigan
city
area
the
only
way
to
close
the
books
on
this
matter
fast
is
to
cover
the
city
with
a
comb
naturally
and
unfortunately
this
will
mean
inconvenience
to
many
citizens
i
hope
they
will
bear
with
the
inconveniences
gladly
for
the
sake
of
confining
those
two
savages
in
a
place
where
they
can
no
longer
be
a
menace
i
have
methods
of
my
own
and
there
may
be
complaints
reasonable
suggestions
will
be
needed
but
with
crackpots
i
have
no
patience
the
radio
began
to
spew
more
sports
results
oliver
turned
and
waved
at
it
to
be
silent
i
do
like
that
he
whispered
i
never
heard
of
this
regan
in
the
chicago
police
they
said
he
was
in
the
public
eye
i
was
the
public
i
did
some
posters
for
the
police
and
i
knew
who
was
who
and
that
bit
at
the
end
i
heard
things
like
it
before
the
mob
does
often
admit
it
in
the
wrong
you
know
when
they
try
to
disarm
criticism
in
advance
this
regan
must
be
a
rough
fellow
charles
and
lee
falcaro
looked
at
each
other
in
sudden
fear
we
want
to
hurry
you
ken
she
said
but
it
looks
as
though
you
better
do
a
rush
job
nodding
oliver
bent
over
the
table
maybe
a
week
he
said
hopefully
with
the
finest
pen
he
traced
the
curlicues
an
engraving
lathe
had
evolved
to
make
the
passes
foolproof
odd
he
thought
the
lives
of
these
two
hanging
by
such
a
weak
thing
as
the
twisted
thread
of
color
that
feeds
from
pen
to
paper
and
as
an
afterthought
i
suppose
mine
does
too
oliver
came
back
the
next
day
to
work
with
concentrated
fury
barely
stopping
to
eat
and
not
stopping
to
talk
lee
got
it
out
of
him
but
not
easily
after
being
trapped
in
a
half
dozen
contradictions
about
feeling
well
and
having
a
headache
about
his
throat
being
sore
and
the
pain
having
gone
he
put
down
his
pen
and
whispered
steadily
i
did
want
you
to
worry
friends
but
it
looks
bad
there
is
a
new
crowd
in
town
twenty
couples
have
been
pulled
in
by
them
to
prove
who
they
were
maybe
fifty
people
have
been
pulled
in
for
questioning
what
do
you
know
about
this
what
do
you
know
about
that
and
they
begun
house
searches
anybody
you
do
like
you
tell
the
new
regan
about
him
say
he
sheltering
europeans
and
his
people
pull
them
in
why
everybody
wants
to
know
are
they
pulling
in
couples
who
are
obviously
american
if
they
looking
for
europeans
and
everybody
says
never
seen
anything
like
it
now
i
think
i
better
get
back
to
work
yes
lee
said
i
think
you
had
charles
was
at
the
window
peering
around
the
drawn
blind
look
at
that
he
said
to
lee
she
came
over
a
big
man
on
the
street
below
was
walking
very
methodically
down
the
street
i
will
bet
you
charles
said
that
he
be
back
this
way
in
ten
minutes
or
so
and
so
on
through
the
night
i
wo
take
the
bet
she
said
he
a
sentry
all
right
the
learning
from
their
friends
across
the
water
learning
too
damned
much
they
must
be
all
over
town
they
watched
at
the
window
and
the
sentry
was
back
in
ten
minutes
on
his
fifth
tour
he
stopped
a
young
couple
going
down
the
street
studied
their
faces
drew
a
gun
on
them
and
blew
a
whistle
a
patrol
came
and
took
them
away
the
girl
was
hysterical
at
two
in
the
morning
the
sentry
was
relieved
by
another
just
as
big
and
just
as
dangerous
looking
at
two
in
the
morning
they
were
still
watching
and
oliver
was
still
hunched
over
the
table
tracing
exquisite
filigree
of
color
in
five
days
virtually
without
sleep
oliver
finished
two
michigan
travel
permits
the
apartment
house
next
door
was
hit
by
raiders
while
the
ink
dried
charles
and
lee
falcaro
stood
waiting
grotesquely
armed
with
kitchen
knives
but
it
must
have
been
a
tip
rather
than
part
of
the
search
plan
crawling
nearer
to
their
end
of
town
the
raiders
did
not
hit
their
building
oliver
had
bought
clothes
according
to
lee
instructions
including
two
men
suits
oliver
size
one
she
let
out
for
charles
the
other
she
took
in
for
herself
she
instructed
charles
minutely
in
how
he
was
to
behave
on
the
outside
first
he
roared
with
incredulous
laughter
lee
wise
in
psychology
assured
him
that
she
was
perfectly
serious
oliver
puzzled
by
his
naivete
assured
him
that
such
things
were
not
uncommon
not
at
least
in
mob
territory
charles
then
roared
with
indignation
and
lee
roared
him
down
his
last
broken
protest
was
but
what
i
do
if
somebody
takes
me
up
on
it
she
shrugged
washing
her
hands
of
the
matter
and
went
on
trimming
and
dying
her
hair
it
was
morning
when
she
kissed
oliver
said
to
charles
see
you
at
the
station
do
say
and
walked
from
the
apartment
a
boy
with
a
slight
limp
charles
watched
her
down
the
street
a
cop
turned
to
look
after
her
and
then
went
on
his
way
half
an
hour
later
charles
shook
hands
with
oliver
and
went
out
oliver
did
go
to
work
that
day
he
sat
all
day
at
the
table
drawing
endless
slow
sketches
of
lee
falcaro
head
time
the
great
kidder
he
thought
he
opens
the
door
that
shows
you
in
the
next
room
tables
of
goodies
colorful
and
tasty
men
and
women
around
the
tables
pleasantly
surprised
to
see
you
beckoning
to
you
to
join
the
feast
we
have
roast
beef
if
you
serious
we
have
caviar
if
you
experimental
we
have
baked
alaska
if
you
frivolous
join
the
feast
try
a
little
bit
of
everything
so
you
start
toward
the
door
time
the
great
kidder
pulls
the
rug
from
under
your
feet
and
slams
the
door
while
the
guests
at
the
feast
laugh
their
heads
off
at
your
painful
but
superficial
injuries
oliver
slowly
drew
lee
head
for
the
fifteenth
time
and
wished
he
dared
to
turn
on
the
audio
for
the
news
perhaps
he
thought
the
next
voice
you
hear
will
be
the
cops
at
the
door
xxi
charles
walked
down
the
street
and
ran
immediately
into
a
challenge
from
a
police
sergeant
where
you
from
mister
the
cop
demanded
balanced
and
ready
to
draw
charles
gulped
and
let
lee
falcaro
drilling
take
over
oh
around
sergeant
i
from
around
here
what
you
so
nervous
about
why
sergeant
you
such
an
exciting
type
really
did
anybody
ever
tell
you
you
look
well
in
uniform
the
cop
glared
at
him
and
said
if
i
was
in
uniform
i
hang
one
on
you
sister
and
if
the
force
was
all
out
hunting
the
lunatics
that
killed
regan
i
pull
you
in
for
spitting
on
the
sidewalk
get
to
hell
off
my
beat
and
stay
off
i
not
forgetting
your
face
charles
scurried
on
it
had
worked
it
worked
once
more
with
a
uniformed
policeman
one
of
the
chicago
imports
was
the
third
and
last
he
socked
charles
in
the
jaw
and
sent
him
on
his
way
with
a
kick
in
the
rear
he
had
been
thoroughly
warned
that
it
would
probably
happen
count
on
them
to
that
the
key
to
it
you
make
them
so
eager
to
assert
their
own
virility
that
it
temporarily
bury
their
primary
mission
it
quite
likely
that
one
or
more
pokes
will
be
taken
at
you
all
you
can
do
is
take
them
if
you
get
you
get
through
they
be
cheap
at
the
price
the
sock
in
the
jaw
had
been
very
expert
the
kick
in
the
pants
was
negligible
considering
the
fact
that
it
had
propelled
him
through
the
gate
of
the
michigan
city
transport
terminal
by
the
big
terminal
clock
the
express
was
due
in
fifteen
minutes
its
gleaming
single
rail
as
tall
as
a
man
crossed
the
far
end
of
the
concourse
most
of
the
people
in
the
station
were
probably
safe
geldings
who
could
be
trusted
to
visit
syndic
territory
off
the
leash
and
return
obediently
of
course
and
many
past
with
a
stake
in
the
mob
territory
stronger
than
hope
of
freedom
one
youngster
though
oh
it
was
lee
leaning
against
a
pillar
and
reading
the
green
sheet
who
were
the
cops
in
the
crowd
the
thickset
man
with
restless
eyes
of
course
the
guy
who
kept
moving
and
glancing
into
faces
charles
went
to
the
newsstand
and
put
a
coin
in
the
slot
for
mob
a
short
by
the
same
arrowsmith
hunde
who
had
brightened
and
misinformed
his
youth
nothing
to
it
he
thought
train
comes
in
put
your
money
in
the
turnstile
show
your
permit
to
the
turnstile
eye
get
aboard
and
unless
the
money
is
phony
or
the
pass
is
phony
in
which
case
the
turnstile
locks
and
all
hell
breaks
loose
his
money
was
just
dandy
but
the
permit
now
there
had
been
any
way
to
test
it
against
a
turnstile
template
or
time
to
do
it
if
there
had
been
a
way
was
the
probability
of
boarding
two
to
one
the
probability
abruptly
dropped
to
zero
as
a
round
little
man
flanked
by
two
huge
men
entered
the
station
the
picture
puzzle
fell
into
a
whole
as
the
two
plainclothesmen
circulating
in
the
station
eyed
grinnel
and
nodded
to
him
the
big
one
made
a
gesture
that
was
the
start
of
a
police
salute
grinnel
was
maurice
regan
the
maurice
regan
mysteriously
unknown
to
oliver
who
knew
the
chicago
police
grinnel
was
a
bit
of
a
from
the
north
american
navy
called
in
because
of
his
unique
knowledge
of
charles
orsino
and
lee
falcaro
their
faces
voices
and
behavior
grinnel
was
the
expert
in
combing
the
city
without
any
nonsense
about
rights
and
mouthpieces
grinnel
was
the
expert
who
could
set
up
a
military
interior
guard
of
the
city
grinnel
was
the
specialist
temporarily
invested
with
the
rank
of
a
regan
so
he
could
do
his
job
the
round
little
man
with
the
halo
of
hair
walked
briskly
to
the
turnstile
and
there
stood
at
a
military
parade
rest
with
a
look
of
resignation
on
his
face
how
hard
on
me
it
is
he
seemed
to
be
saying
that
i
have
such
dull
damn
duty
how
hard
that
an
officer
of
my
brilliance
must
do
for
every
train
to
syndic
territory
the
youth
who
was
lee
falcaro
looked
at
him
over
her
green
sheet
and
nodded
before
dipping
into
the
tia
juana
past
performances
again
she
knew
passengers
were
beginning
to
line
up
at
the
turnstile
smoothing
out
their
money
and
fiddling
with
their
permits
in
a
minute
he
and
lee
falcaro
would
have
to
join
the
line
or
stand
conspicuously
on
the
emptying
floor
the
thing
was
dead
for
hours
now
until
the
next
train
and
then
grinnel
headed
across
the
floor
looking
very
impersonal
the
look
of
a
man
going
to
the
men
room
the
station
cops
and
grinnel
two
bruisers
drifted
together
at
the
turnstile
and
began
to
chat
charles
followed
grinnel
wearing
the
same
impersonal
look
and
entered
the
room
almost
on
his
heels
grinnel
saw
him
in
a
mirror
simultaneously
he
half
turned
opened
his
mouth
to
yell
and
whipped
his
hand
into
his
coat
a
single
right
from
charles
crunched
into
the
soft
side
of
his
neck
he
fell
with
his
head
twisted
at
an
odd
angle
blood
began
to
run
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
onto
his
shirt
remember
martha
charles
whispered
down
at
the
body
that
was
for
murder
he
looked
around
the
tiled
room
there
was
a
mop
closet
with
the
door
ajar
and
grinnel
flabby
body
fitted
in
it
charles
walked
from
the
washroom
to
the
line
of
passengers
across
the
floor
it
seemed
to
go
on
for
miles
lee
falcaro
was
no
longer
lounging
against
the
past
he
spotted
her
in
line
still
still
gaping
over
the
magazine
the
monorail
began
to
sing
shrilly
with
the
vibration
of
the
train
braking
a
mile
away
and
the
turnstile
unlocked
light
went
on
there
was
the
usual
number
of
fumblers
the
usual
number
of
please
unfold
your
currency
flashes
lee
carried
through
to
the
end
with
her
slovenly
pose
for
her
the
sign
said
incorrect
denominations
behind
her
a
man
snarled
for
christ
sake
kid
we
all
waiting
on
you
the
cops
only
half
noticed
they
were
talking
when
charles
got
to
the
turnstile
one
of
the
cops
was
saying
maybe
it
something
he
ate
how
like
somebody
to
barge
in
the
rest
was
lost
in
the
clicking
of
the
turnstile
that
let
him
through
he
settled
in
a
very
pneumatic
chair
as
the
train
accelerated
evenly
to
a
speed
of
three
hundred
and
fifty
miles
per
hour
a
sign
in
the
car
said
that
the
next
stop
was
buffalo
and
there
was
lee
lurching
up
the
aisle
against
the
acceleration
she
spotted
him
tossed
the
green
sheet
in
the
air
and
fell
into
his
lap
disgusting
snarled
a
man
across
the
aisle
simply
disgusting
you
have
seen
anything
yet
lee
told
him
and
kissed
charles
on
the
mouth
the
man
choked
i
shall
certainly
report
this
to
the
authorities
when
we
arrive
in
buffalo
mmm
said
lee
preoccupied
do
that
mister
do
that
xxii
i
did
like
his
reaction
charles
told
her
in
the
anteroom
of
taylor
office
i
did
talk
to
him
long
on
the
phone
but
i
like
his
reaction
at
all
he
seemed
to
think
i
was
exaggerating
or
all
wet
or
a
punk
kid
i
can
assure
him
you
not
that
lee
falcaro
said
warmly
call
on
me
any
time
he
gave
her
a
worried
smile
the
door
opened
then
and
they
went
in
uncle
frank
looked
up
we
just
about
written
you
two
off
he
said
what
it
like
bad
charles
said
worse
than
anything
you
imagined
there
an
underground
all
right
and
they
are
practicing
assassination
too
bad
the
old
man
said
we
have
to
shake
up
the
bodyguard
organization
make
de
rigeur
at
all
hours
screen
and
see
that
they
really
know
how
to
shoot
i
hate
to
meddle
but
we
ca
have
the
government
knocking
our
people
off
it
worse
than
that
lee
said
there
a
between
the
government
and
the
mob
we
got
away
from
ireland
aboard
a
speed
boat
and
we
were
picked
up
by
a
mob
lakes
ore
ship
it
had
been
running
gasoline
and
ammunition
to
the
government
jimmy
regan
was
in
charge
of
the
deal
we
jumped
into
lake
michigan
and
made
our
way
back
here
we
were
in
mob
territory
down
among
the
long
enough
to
establish
that
the
mob
and
government
are
hand
in
glove
one
of
these
day
going
to
jump
us
ah
taylor
said
softly
i
thought
so
for
a
long
time
charles
burst
out
then
for
god
sake
uncle
frank
why
have
you
anything
you
do
know
what
it
like
out
there
the
government
a
nightmare
they
have
slaves
and
the
mob
not
much
better
numbers
restrictions
permits
passes
and
they
do
call
it
that
but
they
have
taxes
they
mad
lee
said
quite
mad
and
i
talking
technically
neurotics
and
psychotics
swarm
in
the
streets
of
mob
territory
the
government
naturally
but
the
mob
was
a
shock
we
got
to
get
ready
taylor
every
psychotic
or
severe
neurotic
in
syndic
territory
is
a
potential
agent
of
theirs
do
just
check
off
the
government
darling
charles
said
tensely
they
got
to
be
smashed
they
no
good
to
themselves
or
anybody
else
life
a
burden
there
if
only
they
knew
it
and
they
holding
down
the
natives
by
horrible
cruelty
taylor
leaned
back
and
asked
what
do
you
recommend
charles
said
a
fighting
fleet
and
an
army
lee
said
mass
diagnosis
of
the
unstable
screening
of
severe
cases
and
treatment
where
it
indicated
riveredge
must
be
a
of
agents
taylor
shook
his
head
and
told
them
it
wo
do
charles
was
aghast
it
wo
uncle
frank
what
the
hell
do
you
mean
it
wo
do
did
we
make
it
clear
they
want
to
invade
us
and
loot
us
and
subject
us
it
wo
do
taylor
said
i
choose
the
devil
we
know
a
fighting
fleet
is
out
we
arm
our
merchant
vessels
and
hope
for
the
best
a
army
is
out
we
get
together
of
militia
and
a
roundup
of
the
unstable
is
out
why
lee
demanded
my
people
have
worked
out
perfectly
effective
techniques
let
me
talk
please
i
have
a
feeling
that
it
wo
be
any
good
but
hear
me
out
i
take
your
black
art
first
lee
as
you
know
i
have
played
with
history
to
a
historian
your
work
has
been
very
interesting
the
sequence
was
this
study
of
abnormal
psychology
collapsed
under
lieberman
findings
study
of
abnormal
psychology
revived
by
you
when
you
invalidated
lieberman
findings
i
suggest
that
lieberman
and
his
followers
were
correct
and
that
you
were
correct
i
suggest
that
what
changed
was
the
makeup
of
the
population
that
would
mean
that
before
lieberman
there
were
plenty
of
neurotics
and
psychotics
to
study
that
in
lieberman
time
there
were
so
few
that
earlier
generalizations
were
invalidated
and
that
now
in
our
time
lee
neurotics
and
psychotics
are
among
us
again
in
increasingly
ample
numbers
the
girl
opened
her
mouth
shut
it
again
and
thoughtfully
studied
her
nails
i
will
not
tolerate
taylor
went
on
a
roundup
or
a
registration
or
mass
treatment
or
any
such
violation
of
the
syndic
spirit
charles
exploded
damn
it
this
is
a
matter
of
life
or
death
to
the
syndic
no
charles
nothing
can
be
a
matter
of
life
or
death
to
the
syndic
when
anything
becomes
a
matter
of
life
or
death
to
the
syndic
the
syndic
is
already
dead
its
morale
is
already
disintegrated
its
credit
already
gone
what
is
left
is
not
the
syndic
but
the
syndic
dead
shell
i
am
not
placed
so
that
i
can
say
objectively
now
whether
the
syndic
is
dead
or
alive
i
fear
it
is
dying
the
rising
tide
of
neurotics
is
a
symptom
the
suggestion
from
you
two
who
should
be
imbued
with
the
old
esprit
of
the
syndic
that
we
cower
behind
mercenaries
instead
of
trusting
the
people
who
made
us
that
another
symptom
dick
reiner
rise
to
influence
on
a
policy
of
driving
the
government
from
the
seas
is
another
symptom
i
mentioned
the
devil
we
know
as
my
choice
that
the
status
quo
even
though
i
have
reason
to
fear
it
crumbling
beneath
our
feet
if
it
is
it
may
last
out
our
time
we
shore
it
up
with
armed
merchantmen
and
a
militia
if
the
people
are
with
us
now
as
they
always
have
been
do
it
the
devil
we
do
know
is
what
we
become
if
we
radically
dislocate
syndic
life
and
attitudes
i
ca
back
a
fighting
fleet
i
ca
back
a
regular
army
i
back
any
restrictive
measure
on
the
freedom
of
anybody
but
an
apprehended
criminal
read
history
it
has
taught
me
not
to
meddle
it
has
taught
me
that
no
man
should
think
himself
clever
enough
or
good
enough
to
dare
it
is
the
lesson
history
teaches
us
who
can
know
what
he
doing
when
he
does
even
know
why
he
does
it
bless
the
bright

bless
pharaoh
for

and
damn
him
for

bless

for
restricting

so
the

west
and
damn
the
prostitution

sodomy
and
wars
of
colonization
by
which
they
did
it
bless
the
romans
for
their
strength
to
smash
down
every
wall
that
hemmed
their

or
what
the
consequences
will
be
let
the
social
scientists
play
with
their
theories
if
they
like
fond
of
poetry
myself
the
fact
is
that
they
have
not
so
far
solved
what
i
call
the
problem
with
brilliant
hindsight
some
of
them
tell
us
that
more
than
a
dozen
civilizations
have
gone
down
into
the
darkness
before
us
i

will
not
agitate
for
extermination
of
the
government
and
hegemony

shall
with
fear
and

recommend
