chapter

the
young
man
who
came
to
stay
there
is
a
fertile
stretch
of
flat
lands
in
indiana
where
unagrarian
eastern
travellers
glancing
from
shudder
and
return
their
eyes
to
interior
upholstery
preferring
even
the
swaying
caparisons
of
a
pullman
to
the
monotony
without
the
landscape
lies
interminably
level
bleak
in
winter
a
desolate
plain
of
mud
and
snow
hot
and
dusty
in
summer
in
its
flat
lonesomeness
miles
on
miles
with
not
one
cool
hill
slope
away
from
the
sun
the
persistent
tourist
who
seeks
for
signs
of
man
in
this
sad
expanse
perceives
a
reckless
amount
of
rail
fence
at
intervals
a
large
barn
and
here
and
there
man
himself
incurious
patient
slow
looking
up
from
the
fields
apathetically
as
the
limited
flies
by
widely
separated
from
each
other
are
small
frame
railway
stations
sometimes
with
no
other
building
in
sight
which
indicates
that
somewhere
behind
the
adjacent
woods
a
few
shanties
and
thin
cottages
are
grouped
about
a
couple
of
brick
stores
on
the
station
platforms
there
are
always
two
or
three
wooden
apparently
marked
for
travel
but
they
are
sacred
from
disturbance
and
remain
on
the
platform
forever
possibly
the
right
train
never
comes
along
they
serve
to
enthrone
a
few
station
loafers
who
look
out
from
under
their
at
the
faces
in
the
with
the
languid
scorn
a
permanent
fixture
always
has
for
a
transient
and
the
pity
an
american
feels
for
a
who
does
not
live
in
his
town
now
and
then
the
train
passes
a
town
built
scatteringly
about
a
with
a
mill
or
two
humming
near
the
tracks
this
is
a
and
the
inhabitants
and
the
local
papers
refer
to
it
confidently
as
our
the
heart
of
the
flat
lands
is
a
central
area
called
carlow
county
and
the
of
carlow
is
a
town
unhappily
named
in
honor
of
its
first
settler
william
platt
who
christened
it
with
his
blood
natives
of
this
place
have
sometimes
remarked
easily
that
their
city
had
a
population
of
from
five
to
six
thousand
souls
it
is
easy
to
forgive
them
for
such
statements
civic
pride
is
a
virtue
the
social
and
business
energy
of
plattville
concentrates
on
the
square
here
in
the
gentlemen
are
wont
to
lounge
from
store
to
store
in
their
shirt
sleeves
and
here
stood
the
old
loosely
fenced
in
a
shady
grove
of
maple
and
elm
ellum
called
the
when
the
sun
grew
too
hot
for
the
box
whittlers
in
front
of
the
stores
around
the
square
and
the
occupants
of
the
chairs
in
front
of
the
palace
hotel
on
the
corner
they
would
go
across
and
drape
themselves
over
the
fence
under
the
trees
and
leisurely
carve
there
initials
on
the
top
board
the
farmers
hitched
their
teams
to
the
fence
for
there
were
usually
loafers
energetic
enough
to
shout
whoa
if
the
flies
worried
the
horses
beyond
patience
in
the
yard
amongst
the
weeds
and
tall
unkept
grass
chickens
foraged
all
day
long
the
fence
was
so
low
that
the
most
matronly
hen
flew
over
with
propriety
and
there
were
gaps
that
accommodated
the
passage
of
itinerant
pigs
most
of
the
latter
however
preferred
the
cool
wallows
of
the
less
important
street
corners
here
and
there
a
big
dog
lay
asleep
in
the
middle
of
the
road
knowing
well
that
the
samaritan
in
his
case
would
pass
by
on
the
other
side
only
one
street
attained
to
the
dignity
of
a
name
main
street
which
formed
the
north
side
of
the
square
in
carlow
county
descriptive
location
is
usually
accomplished
by
designating
the
adjacent
as
up
at
bardlocks
down
by
schofields
right
where
hibbards
live
acrost
from
sol
tibbs
or
other
side
of
jones
in
winter
main
street
was
a
series
of
frozen
gorges
land
hummocks
in
fall
and
spring
a
river
of
mud
in
summer
a
continuing
dust
heap
it
was
the
best
street
in
plattville
the
people
lived
happily
and
while
the
world
whirled
on
outside
they
were
content
with
their
own
it
would
have
moved
their
surprise
as
much
as
their
indignation
to
hear
themselves
spoken
of
as
a
secluded
community
for
they
sat
up
all
night
to
hear
the
vote
of
new
york
every
campaign
once
when
the
president
visited
rouen
seventy
miles
away
there
were
only
few
bankrupts
and
not
a
baby
amongst
them
left
in
the
deserted
homes
of
carlow
county
everybody
had
adventures
almost
everybody
saw
the
great
man
and
everybody
was
glad
to
get
back
home
again
it
was
the
longest
journey
some
of
them
ever
set
upon
and
these
elated
as
they
were
over
their
travels
determined
to
think
twice
ere
they
went
that
far
from
home
another
time
on
saturdays
the
farmers
enlivened
the
commercial
atmosphere
of
plattville
and
miss
tibbs
the
postmaster
sister
and
clerk
used
to
make
a
point
of
walking
up
and
down
main
street
as
often
as
possible
to
get
a
thrill
in
the
realization
of
some
poetical
expressions
that
haunted
her
pleasingly
phrases
she
had
employed
frequently
in
her
poems
for
the
carlow
county
when
thirty
or
forty
country
people
were
scattered
along
the
sidewalks
in
front
of
the
stores
on
main
street
she
would
walk
at
nicely
calculated
angles
to
the
different
groups
so
as
to
leave
as
few
gaps
as
possible
between
the
figures
making
them
appear
as
near
a
solid
phalanx
as
she
could
then
she
would
murmur
to
herself
with
the
accent
of
soulful
revel
the
thronged
city
streets
and
within
the
thronged
city
or
where
the
thronging
crowds
were
swarming
and
the
great
cathedral
although
she
had
never
been
beyond
carlow
and
the
bordering
counties
in
her
life
all
her
poems
were
of
city
streets
and
bustling
multitudes
she
was
one
of
those
who
had
been
unable
to
join
the
excursion
to
rouen
when
the
president
was
there
but
she
had
listened
avidly
to
her
friends
descriptions
of
the
crowds
before
that
time
her
muse
had
been
sylvan
speaking
of
of
may
and
hinting
at
thoughts
that
overcame
her
when
she
roved
the
woodlands
thro
but
now
the
inspiration
was
become
decidedly
municipal
and
urban
evidently
reluctant
to
depart
beyond
the
retail
portions
of
a
metropolis
her
verses
beginning
o
my
native
city
bride
of
winding
stream
hibbard
creek
runs
west
of
plattville
except
in
time
of
drought
when
thy
myriad
lights
are
shining
and
thy
faces
like
a
dream
go
flitting
down
thy
sidewalks
when
their
daily
toil
is
done
were
pronounced
at
the
time
of
their
publication
the
best
poem
that
had
ever
appeared
in
the
this
unlucky
newspaper
was
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
every
patriot
of
carlow
county
it
was
a
poor
paper
everybody
knew
it
was
a
poor
paper
it
was
so
poor
that
everybody
admitted
it
was
a
poor
paper
worse
the
neighboring
county
of
amo
possessed
a
better
paper
the
amo
the
carlow
county
herald
was
so
everlastingly
bad
that
plattville
people
bent
their
heads
bitterly
and
admitted
even
to
citizens
of
amo
that
the
gazette
was
the
better
paper
the
herald
was
a
weekly
issued
on
saturday
sometimes
it
hung
fire
over
sunday
and
appeared
monday
evening
in
their
pride
the
carlow
people
supported
the
herald
loyally
and
long
but
finally
subscriptions
began
to
fall
off
and
the
gazette
gained
them
it
came
to
pass
that
the
herald
missed
fire
altogether
for
several
weeks
then
it
came
out
feebly
two
small
advertisements
occupying
the
whole
of
the
fourth
page
it
was
breathing
its
last
the
editor
was
a
gentleman
with
a
goatee
whose
one
surreptitious
eye
betokened
both
indolence
of
disposition
and
a
certain
furtive
shrewdness
he
collected
all
the
outstanding
subscriptions
he
could
on
the
morning
of
the
issue
just
mentioned
and
thoughtfully
neglecting
several
items
on
the
other
side
of
the
ledger
departed
from
plattville
forever
the
same
afternoon
a
young
man
from
the
east
alighted
on
the
platform
of
the
railway
station
north
of
the
town
and
entering
the
rickety
omnibus
that
lingered
there
seeking
whom
it
might
rattle
to
deafness
demanded
to
be
driven
to
the
herald
building
it
did
not
strike
the
driver
that
the
newcomer
was
precisely
a
gay
young
man
when
he
climbed
into
the
omnibus
but
an
hour
later
as
he
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
edifice
he
had
indicated
as
his
destination
depression
seemed
to
have
settled
into
the
marrow
of
his
bones
plattville
was
instantly
alert
to
the
stranger
presence
and
interesting
conjectures
were
hazarded
all
day
long
at
the
back
door
of
martin
emporium
where
all
the
clerks
from
the
stores
around
the
square
came
to
play
checkers
or
look
on
at
the
game
this
was
the
club
during
the
day
in
the
evening
the
club
and
the
game
removed
to
the
drug
book
and
store
on
the
corner
at
supper
the
new
arrival
and
his
probable
purposes
were
discussed
over
every
table
in
the
town
upon
inquiry
he
had
informed
judd
bennett
the
driver
of
the
omnibus
that
he
had
come
to
stay
naturally
such
a
declaration
caused
a
sensation
as
people
did
not
come
to
plattville
to
live
except
through
the
inadvertency
of
being
born
there
in
addition
the
young
man
appearance
and
attire
were
reported
to
be
extraordinary
many
of
the
curious
among
them
most
of
the
marriageable
females
of
the
place
took
occasion
to
pass
and
repass
the
sign
of
the
carlow
county
herald
during
the
evening
meanwhile
the
stranger
was
seated
in
the
dingy
office
upstairs
with
his
head
bowed
low
on
his
arms
twilight
stole
through
the
dirty
and
faded
into
darkness
night
filled
the
room
he
did
not
move
the
young
man
from
the
east
had
bought
the
herald
from
an
agent
had
bought
it
without
ever
having
been
within
a
hundred
miles
of
plattville
he
had
vastly
overpaid
for
it
moreover
the
price
he
had
paid
for
it
was
all
the
money
he
had
in
the
world
the
next
morning
he
went
bitterly
to
work
he
hired
a
compositor
from
rouen
a
young
man
named
parker
who
set
type
all
night
long
and
helped
him
pursue
advertisements
all
day
the
citizens
shook
their
heads
pessimistically
they
had
about
given
up
the
idea
that
the
herald
could
ever
amount
to
anything
and
they
betrayed
an
innocent
but
caustic
doubt
of
ability
in
any
stranger
one
day
the
new
editor
left
a
note
on
his
door
will
return
in
fifteen
rodney
mccune
a
politician
from
the
neighboring
county
of
gaines
happening
to
be
in
plattville
on
an
errand
to
his
henchmen
found
the
note
and
wrote
beneath
the
message
the
scathing
inquiry
why
when
he
discovered
this
addendum
the
editor
smiled
for
the
first
time
since
his
advent
and
reported
the
incident
in
his
next
issue
using
the
rubric
why
has
the
returned
to
life
as
a
text
for
a
rousing
editorial
on
honesty
in
politics
a
subject
of
which
he
already
knew
something
the
political
district
to
which
carlow
belonged
was
governed
by
a
limited
number
of
gentlemen
whose
wealth
was
ever
on
the
increase
and
honesty
in
politics
was
a
startling
conception
to
the
minds
of
the
passive
and
resigned
voters
who
discussed
the
editorial
on
the
street
corners
and
in
the
stores
the
next
week
there
was
another
editorial
personal
and
local
in
its
application
and
thereby
it
became
evident
that
the
new
proprietor
of
the
herald
was
a
theorist
who
believed
in
general
that
a
politician
honor
should
not
be
merely
of
that
middling
healthy
species
known
as
honor
amongst
politicians
and
in
particular
that
rodney
mccune
should
not
receive
the
nomination
of
his
party
for
congress
now
mccune
was
the
undoubted
dictator
of
the
district
and
his
followers
laughed
at
the
stranger
fantastic
onset
but
the
editor
was
not
content
with
the
word
of
print
he
hired
a
horse
and
rode
about
the
country
and
to
his
own
surprise
he
proved
to
be
an
adaptable
young
man
who
enjoyed
exercise
with
a
pitchfork
to
the
farmer
profit
while
the
farmer
talked
he
talked
little
himself
but
after
listening
an
hour
or
so
he
would
drop
a
word
from
the
saddle
as
he
left
and
then
by
some
surprising
wizardry
the
farmer
thinking
over
the
interview
decided
there
was
some
sense
in
what
that
young
fellow
said
and
grew
curious
to
see
what
the
young
fellow
had
further
to
say
in
the
politics
is
the
one
subject
that
goes
to
the
vitals
of
every
rural
american
and
a
hoosier
will
talk
politics
after
he
is
dead
everybody
read
the
campaign
editorials
and
found
them
interesting
although
there
was
no
one
who
did
not
perceive
the
utter
absurdity
of
a
young
stranger
dropping
into
carlow
and
involving
himself
in
a
party
fight
against
the
boss
of
the
district
it
was
entirely
a
party
fight
for
by
grace
of
the
last
gerrymander
the
nomination
carried
with
it
the
certainty
of
election
a
week
before
the
convention
there
came
a
provincial
earthquake
the
news
passed
from
man
to
man
in
whispers
mccune
had
withdrawn
his
name
making
the
hollowest
of
excuses
to
his
cohorts
nothing
was
known
of
the
real
reason
for
his
disordered
retreat
beyond
the
fact
that
he
had
been
in
plattville
on
the
morning
before
his
withdrawal
and
had
issued
from
a
visit
to
the
herald
office
in
a
state
of
palsy
parker
the
rouen
printer
had
been
present
at
the
close
of
the
interview
but
he
held
his
peace
at
the
command
of
his
employer
he
had
been
called
into
the
sanctum
and
had
found
mccune
white
and
shaking
leaning
on
the
desk
parker
said
the
editor
exhibiting
a
bundle
of
papers
he
held
in
his
hand
i
want
you
to
witness
a
verbal
contract
between
mccune
and
myself
these
papers
are
an
affidavit
and
copies
of
some
records
of
a
company
which
obtained
a
charter
while
mr
mccune
was
in
the
state
legislature
they
were
sent
to
me
by
a
man
i
do
not
know
an
anonymous
friend
of
mccune
in
fact
a
friend
he
seems
to
have
lost
on
consideration
of
our
not
printing
these
papers
mccune
agrees
to
retire
from
politics
for
good
you
understand
if
he
ever
lifts
his
head
again
politically
we
publish
them
and
the
courts
will
do
the
rest
now
in
case
anything
should
happen
to
me
something
will
happen
to
you
all
right
broke
out
mccune
you
can
bank
on
that
you
black
come
the
editor
interrupted
not
unpleasantly
why
should
there
be
anything
personal
in
all
this
i
do
recognize
you
as
my
private
enemy
not
at
all
and
i
think
you
are
getting
off
rather
easily
you
you
stay
out
of
politics
and
everything
will
be
comfortable
you
ought
never
to
have
been
in
it
you
see
it
a
mistake
not
to
keep
square
because
in
the
long
run
somebody
is
sure
to
give
you
away
like
the
fellow
who
sent
me
these
you
promise
to
hold
to
a
strictly
private
life
you
a
traitor
to
the
party
groaned
the
other
but
you
only
wait
the
editor
smiled
sadly
wait
nothing
do
threaten
man
go
home
to
your
wife
i
give
you
three
to
one
she
be
glad
you
are
out
of
i
give
you
three
to
one
said
mccune
that
the
white
caps
will
get
you
if
you
stay
in
carlow
you
want
to
look
out
for
yourself
i
tell
you
my
smart
boy
mccune
was
the
answer
let
me
have
your
note
of

glad
you
know
the
sound
of
the
herald
victory
went
over
the
state
the
paper
came
out
regularly
the
townsfolk
bought
it
and
the
farmers
drove

for
it
old

came
back
old

the

county
people

carlow
folk
held
up
their
heads
when
journalism
was
mentioned
presently
the
herald
announced
a
news
connection
with
rouen
and
with
that
and
the
aid
of
patent
insides
began
an
era
of
three
issues
a
week
appearing
on
tuesdays
thursdays
and
saturdays
the
plattville
brass
band
serenaded
the
editor
during
the
second
month
of
the
new
regime
of
the
herald
the
working
force
of
the
paper
received
an
addition
one
night
the
editor
found
some
barroom
loafers
tormenting
a
patriarchal
old
man
who
had
a
magnificent
head
and
a
grand
white
beard
he
had
been
thrown
out
of
a
saloon
and
he
was
drunk
with
the
drunkenness
of
three
weeks
steady
pouring
he
propped
himself
against
a
wall
and
reproved
his
tormentors
in
latin
walking
your
way
fisbee
remarked
the
journalist
hooking
his
arm
into
the
old
man
suppose
we
leave
our
friends
here
and
go
home
fisbee
was
the
one
inhabitant
of
the
town
who
had
an
unknown
past
no
one
knew
more
about
him
than
that
he
had
been
connected
with
a
university
somewhere
and
had
travelled
in
countries
before
he
came
to
plattville
a
glamour
of
romance
was
thrown
about
him
by
the
gossips
to
whom
he
ever
proved
a
fund
of
delightful
speculation
there
was
a
dark
portentous
secret
in
his
life
it
was
agreed
an
opinion
not
too
well
confirmed
by
the
old
man
appearance
his
fine
eyes
had
a
pathetic
habit
of
wandering
to
the
horizon
in
a
questioning
fashion
that
had
a
queer
sort
of
hopelessness
in
it
as
if
his
quest
were
one
for
the
holy
grail
perhaps
and
his
expression
was
mild
vague
and
sad
he
had
a
look
of
race
and
blood
and
yet
at
the
first
glance
one
saw
that
he
was
lost
in
dreams
and
one
guessed
that
the
dreams
would
never
be
of
great
practicability
in
their
application
some
such
impression
of
fisbee
was
probably
what
caused
the
editor
of
the
herald
to
nickname
him
in
his
own
mind
the
white
knight
and
to
conceive
a
strong
if
whimsical
fancy
for
him
old
fisbee
had
come
from
nobody
knew
where
to
plattville
to
teach
and
had
been
principal
of
the
high
school
for
ten
years
instructing
his
pupils
after
a
peculiar
fashion
of
his
own
neglecting
the
ordinary
courses
of
high
school
instruction
to
lecture
on
archaeology
to
the
dumfounded
scholars
growing
year
by
year
more
forgetful
and
absent
lost
in
his
few
books
and
his
own
reflections
until
though
undeniably
a
scholar
he
had
been
discharged
for
incompetency
he
was
old
he
had
no
money
and
no
way
to
make
money
he
could
find
nothing
to
do
the
blow
had
seemed
to
daze
him
for
a
time
then
he
began
to
drop
in
at
the
hotel
bar
where
wilkerson
the
professional
drunkard
favored
him
with
his
society
the
old
man
understood
he
knew
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
he
sold
his
books
in
order
to
continue
his
credit
at
the
palace
bar
and
once
or
twice
unable
to
proceed
to
his
own
dwelling
spent
the
night
in
a
lumber
yard
piloted
thither
by
the
hardier
veteran
wilkerson
the
morning
after
the
editor
took
him
home
fisbee
appeared
at
the
herald
office
in
a
new
hat
and
a
decent
suit
of
black
he
had
received
his
salary
in
advance
his
books
had
been
repurchased
and
he
had
become
the
reportorial
staff
of
the
carlow
county
herald
also
he
was
to
write
various
treatises
for
the
paper
for
the
first
few
evenings
when
he
started
home
from
the
office
his
chief
walked
with
him
chatting
heartily
until
they
had
passed
the
palace
bar
but
fisbee
redemption
was
complete
the
old
man
had
a
daughter
when
she
came
to
plattville
he
told
her
what
the
editor
of
the
herald
had
done
for
him
the
journalist
kept
steadily
at
his
work
and
as
time
went
on
the
bitterness
his
predecessor
swindle
had
left
him
passed
away
but
his
loneliness
and
a
sense
of
defeat
grew
and
deepened
when
the
vistas
of
the
world
had
opened
to
his
first
youth
he
had
not
thought
to
spend
his
life
in
such
a
place
as
plattville
but
he
found
himself
doing
it
and
it
was
no
great
happiness
to
him
that
the
congressional
representative
of
the
district
the
gentleman
whom
the
herald
opposition
to
mccune
had
sent
to
washington
came
to
depend
on
his
influence
for
renomination
nor
did
the
realization
that
the
editor
of
the
carlow
county
herald
had
come
to
be
mccune
successor
as
political
dictator
produce
a
perceptibly
enlivening
effect
on
the
young
man
the
years
drifted
very
slowly
and
to
him
it
seemed
they
went
by
while
he
stood
far
aside
and
could
not
even
see
them
move
he
did
not
consider
the
life
he
led
an
exciting
one
but
the
other
citizens
of
carlow
did
when
he
undertook
a
war
against
the
white
the
natives
were
much
more
afraid
of
the
white
caps
than
he
was
they
knew
more
about
them
and
understood
them
better
than
he
did
chapter
ii
the
strange
lady
it
was
june
from
the
patent
inner
columns
of
the
carlow
county
herald
might
be
gleaned
the
information
enlivened
by
cuts
of
duchesses
that
the
london
season
had
reached
a
high
point
of
gaiety
and
that
although
the
weather
had
grown
inauspiciously
warm
there
was
sufficient
gossip
for
the
thoughtful
to
the
rapt
mind
of
miss
selina
tibbs
came
a
delicious
moment
of
comparison
precisely
the
same
conditions
prevailed
in
plattville
not
unduly
might
miss
selina
lay
this
flattering
unction
to
her
soul
and
well
might
the
herald
declare
that
carlow
events
were
crowding
thick
and
the
congressional
representative
of
the
district
was
to
deliver
a
lecture
at
the
a
circus
was
approaching
the
and
its
glories
would
be
exhibited
rain
or
shine
the
court
had
cleared
up
the
docket
by
sitting
to
unseemly
hours
of
the
night
even
until
ten
one
farmer
witness
had
fallen
asleep
while
deposing
that
he
had
knowed
this
man
hender
some
eighteen
year
and
as
excitements
come
indeed
when
they
do
come
and
it
seldom
rains
but
it
pours
the
identical
afternoon
of
the
lecture
a
strange
lady
descended
from
the
rouen
accommodation
and
was
greeted
on
the
platform
by
the
wealthiest
citizen
of
the
county
judge
briscoe
and
his
daughter
minnie
and
what
stirred
wonder
to
an
itch
almost
beyond
endurance
fisbee
and
they
then
drove
through
town
on
the
way
to
the
briscoe
mansion
all
four
apparently
in
a
fluster
of
pleasure
and
exhilaration
the
strange
lady
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
with
fisbee
on
the
back
seat
judd
bennett
had
had
the
best
stare
at
her
but
as
he
immediately
fell
into
a
dreamy
and
absent
state
little
satisfaction
could
be
got
from
him
merely
an
exasperating
statement
that
the
stranger
seemed
to
have
a
kind
of
new
look
to
her
however
by
means
of
miss
mildy
upton
a
domestic
of
the
briscoe
household
the
community
was
given
something
a
little
more
definite
the
lady
name
was
sherwood
she
lived
in
rouen
and
she
had
known
miss
briscoe
at
the
eastern
school
the
latter
had
attended
to
the
feverish
agitation
of
plattville
three
years
before
but
mildy
confessed
her
inadequacy
in
the
matter
of
fisbee
he
had
driven
up
in
the
buckboard
with
the
others
and
evidently
expected
to
stay
for
supper
tibbs
the
postmaster
it
was
to
the
postoffice
that
miss
upton
brought
her
information
suggested
as
a
possible
explanation
that
the
lady
was
so
learned
that
the
briscoes
had
invited
fisbee
on
the
ground
of
his
being
the
only
person
in
plattville
they
esteemed
wise
enough
to
converse
with
her
but
miss
tibbs
wrecked
her
brother
theory
by
mentioning
the
name
of
fisbee
chief
you
see
solomon
she
sagaciously
observed
if
that
were
true
they
would
have
invited
him
instead
of
fisbee
and
i
wish
they
had
he
is
troubled
with
malaria
and
yet
the
longer
he
lives
here
the
and
he
gets
i
think
the
company
of
a
lovely
stranger
might
be
of
great
cheer
to
his
heart
and
it
will
be
interesting
to
witness
the
meeting
between
them
it
may
be
added
the
poetess
that
they
already
met
on
his
travels
before
he
settled
here
it
may
be
that
they
are
old
friends
or
even
then
what
returned
her
brother
what
is
he
doin
settin
up
in
his
office
all
afternoon
with
ink
on
his
forehead
while
fisbee
goes
out
ridin
with
her
and
stays
for
supper
although
the
problem
of
fisbee
attendance
remained
a
mere
maze
of
hopeless
speculation
mildy
had
been
present
at
the
opening
of
miss
sherwood
trunk
and
here
was
matter
for
the
keen
consideration
of
the
ladies
at
least
thoughtful
conversations
in
regard
to
hats
and
linings
took
place
across
fences
and
on
corners
of
the
square
that
afternoon
and
many
gentlemen
wondered
in
wise
silence
why
their
spouses
were
and
brooded
during
the
evening
meal
at
seven
the
hon
kedge
halloway
of
amo
delivered
himself
of
his
lecture
the
past
and
present
what
we
may
glean
from
them
and
their
influence
on
the
at
seven
the
was
crowded
and
miss
tibbs
seated
on
the
platform
reserved
for
prominent
citizens
viewed
the
expectant
throng
with
rapture
it
is
possible
that
she
would
have
confessed
to
witnessing
a
sea
of
faces
but
it
is
more
probable
that
she
viewed
the
expectant
throng
the
thermometer
stood
at
degrees
and
there
was
a
rustle
of
incessantly
moving
fans
as
row
by
row
their
yellow
sides
twinkled
in
the
light
of
eight
oil
lamps
the
stouter
ladies
wielded
their
fans
with
vigor
there
were
some
very
pretty
faces
in
halloway
audience
but
it
is
a
peculiarity
of
plattville
that
most
of
those
females
who
do
not
incline
to
stoutness
incline
far
in
the
opposite
direction
and
the
lean
ladies
naturally
suffered
less
from
the
temperature
than
their
sisters
the
shorn
lamb
is
cared
for
but
often
there
seems
the
intention
to
impart
a
moral
in
the
refusal
of
providence
to
temper
warm
weather
to
the
old
tom
martin
expressed
a
strong
consciousness
of
such
intention
when
he
observed
to
the
shocked
miss
selina
as
bill
snoddy
the
stoutest
citizen
of
the
county
waddled
abnormally
up
the
aisle
the
almighty
must
be
gittin
a
heap
of
fun
out
of
bill
snoddy
oh
martin
exclaimed
miss
tibbs
fluttering
at
his
irreverence
why
you
would
yourself
miss
seliny
returned
old
tom
martin
always
spoke
in
one
key
never
altering
the
pitch
of
his
high
dry
unctuous
drawl
though
when
his
purpose
was
more
than
ordinarily
humorous
his
voice
assumed
a
shade
of
melancholy
now
and
then
he
meditatively
passed
his
fingers
through
his
gray
beard
which
followed
the
line
of
his
jaw
leaving
his
upper
lip
and
most
of
his
chin
did
you
ever
reason
out
why
folks
laugh
so
much
at
fat
people
he
continued
no
neither
anybody
why
is
it
martin
asked
miss
selina
it
like
the
creator
sayin
there
be
light
he
says
ladies
be
lovely
miss
tibbs
bowed
and
be
honest
sometimes
and
fat
people
be
held
up
to
ridicule
till
they
fall
off
you
ca
tell
why
it
is
it
was
jest
ordained
the
room
was
so
crowded
that
the
juvenile
portion
of
the
assemblage
was
ensconced
in
the
windows
strange
to
say
the
youth
of
plattville
were
not
present
under
protest
as
their
fellows
of
a
metropolis
would
have
been
lectures
being
well
understood
by
the
young
of
great
cities
to
have
instructive
tendencies
the
boys
came
because
they
insisted
upon
coming
it
was
an
event
some
of
them
had
made
sacrifices
to
come
enduring
even
the
agony
next
to
in
suffering
of
having
their
ears
washed
conscious
of
parental
eyes
they
fronted
the
public
with
boyhood
professional
expressionlessness
though
they
communicated
with
each
other
aside
in
a
of
their
own
and
each
group
was
a
of
furtive
gossip
and
sarcastic
comment
seated
in
the
windows
they
kept
out
what
small
breath
of
air
might
otherwise
have
stolen
in
to
comfort
the
audience
their
elders
sat
patiently
dripping
with
perspiration
most
of
the
gentlemen
undergoing
the
unusual
garniture
of
collars
those
who
had
not
cultivated
chin
beards
to
obviate
such
arduous
necessities
of
pomp
and
state
hardly
bearing
up
under
the
added
anxiety
of
cravats
however
they
sat
outwardly
meek
under
the
yoke
nearly
all
of
them
seeking
a
quiet
solace
of
tobacco
not
that
they
smoked
heaven
and
the
gallantry
of
carlow
county
forbid
nor
were
there
anywhere
visible
tokens
of
the
comforting
ministrations
of
nicotine
to
violate
the
eye
of
etiquette
it
is
an
art
of
plattville
suddenly
there
was
a
hum
and
a
stir
and
a
buzz
of
whispering
in
the
room
two
gray
old
men
and
two
pretty
young
women
passed
up
the
aisle
to
the
platform
one
old
man
was
stalwart
and
ruddy
with
a
cordial
eye
and
a
handsome
big
face
the
other
was
bent
and
trembled
slightly
his
face
was
very
white
he
had
a
fine
high
brow
deeply
lined
the
brow
of
a
scholar
and
a
grandly
flowing
white
beard
that
covered
his
chest
the
beard
of
a
patriarch
one
of
the
young
women
was
tall
and
had
the
rosy
cheeks
and
pleasant
eyes
of
her
father
who
preceded
her
the
other
was
the
strange
lady
a
universal
perturbation
followed
her
progress
up
the
aisle
if
she
had
known
it
she
was
small
and
fair
very
daintily
and
beautifully
made
a
pretty
marquise
whose
head
greuze
should
have
painted
columbus
landis
wife
of
the
proprietor
of
the
palace
hotel
conferring
with
a
lady
in
the
next
seat
applied
an
adjective
it
ai
so
much
she
though
she
is
that
but
do
you
notice
she
got
a
kind
of
smart
look
to
her
her
bein
so
teeny
kind
of
makes
it
more
so
somehow
what
stunned
the
gossips
of
the
windows
to
awed
admiration
however
was
the
unconcerned
and
stoical
fashion
in
which
she
wore
a
long
bodkin
straight
through
her
head
it
seemed
a
large
sacrifice
merely
to
make
sure
one
hat
remained
in
place
the
party
took
seats
a
little
to
the
left
and
rear
of
the
table
and
faced
the
audience
the
strange
lady
chatted
gaily
with
the
other
three
apparently
as
unconscious
of
the
multitude
of
eyes
fixed
upon
her
as
the
gazers
were
innocent
of
rude
intent
there
were
pretty
young
women
in
plattville
minnie
briscoe
was
the
prettiest
and
as
the
local
glass
of
fashion
reflected
the
stylishest
but
this
girl
was
different
somehow
in
a
way
the
critics
were
puzzled
to
discover
different
from
the
sparkle
of
her
eyes
and
the
crown
of
her
trim
sailor
hat
to
the
edge
of
her
snowy
duck
skirt
judd
bennett
sighed
a
sigh
that
was
heard
in
every
corner
of
the
room
as
everybody
immediately
turned
to
look
at
him
he
got
up
and
went
out
it
had
long
been
a
jocose
fiction
of
martin
who
was
a
widower
of
thirty
years
standing
that
he
and
the
gifted
authoress
by
his
side
were
in
a
state
of
courtship
now
he
bent
his
rugged
head
toward
her
to
whisper
i
never
thought
to
see
the
day
you
have
a
rival
in
my
affections
miss
seliny
but
yonder
looks
like
it
i
reckon
i
have
to
go
up
to
ben
tinkle
and
buy
that
fancy

twelve
year
or
more

when
she

better
take
warning
and
watch
me
fisbee
wo
have
no
clear
field
from
now
the
stranger
leaned
across
to
speak
to
miss
briscoe
and
her
sleeve
touched
the
left
shoulder
of
the
old
man
with
the
patriarchal
white
beard
a
moment
later
he
put
his
right
hand
to
that
shoulder
and
gently
moved
it
up
and
down
with
a
caressing
motion
over
the
shabby
black
broadcloth
her
garment
had
touched
look
at
that
old
fisbee
exclaimed
martin
affecting
indignation
never
be
half
as
spruced
up
and
wide
awake
in
all
his
life
got
her
to
listen
to
him
on
the
decorations
of
nineveh
it
my
belief
he
was
there
when
it
was
destroyed
well
if
i
ca
cut
him
out
we
get
our
respected
young
friend
of
the
to
do
sh
returned
miss
tibbs
here
he
the
seats
upon
the
platform
were
all
occupied
except
the
two
foremost
ones
in
the
centre
one
on
each
side
of
a
little
table
with
a
lamp
a
pitcher
of
and
a
glass
reserved
for
the
lecturer
and
the
gentleman
who
was
to
introduce
him
steps
were
audible
in
the
hall
and
every
one
turned
to
watch
the
door
where
the
distinguished
pair
now
made
their
appearance
in
a
hush
of
expectation
over
which
the
beating
of
the
fans
alone
prevailed
the
hon
kedge
halloway
was
one
of
the
gleaners
of
the
himself
and
he
marched
into
the
room
unostentatiously
mopping
his
shining
expanse
of
brow
with
a
figured
handkerchief
he
was
a
person
of
solemn
appearance
a
fat
gold
which
curved
across
his
ponderous
front
adding
mysteriously
to
his
gravity
at
his
side
strolled
a
very
tall
thin
rather
stooping
though
rather
shabby
young
man
with
a
sallow
melancholy
face
and
eyes
that
looked
tired
when
they
were
seated
the
orator
looked
over
his
audience
slowly
and
with
an
incomparable
calm
then
as
is
always
done
he
and
the
melancholy
young
man
exchanged
whispers
for
a
few
moments
after
this
there
was
a
pause
at
the
end
of
which
the
latter
rose
and
announced
that
it
was
his
pleasure
and
his
privilege
to
introduce
that
evening
a
gentleman
who
needed
no
introduction
to
that
assemblage
what
citizen
of
carlow
needed
an
introduction
asked
the
speaker
to
the
orator
they
had
applauded
in
the
campaigns
of
the
last
twenty
years
the
statesman
author
of
the
halloway
bill
the
most
honored
citizen
of
the
neighboring
and
flourishing
county
and
city
of
amo
and
the
speaker
would
say
that
if
there
were
one
thing
the
citizens
of
carlow
could
be
held
to
envy
the
citizens
of
amo
it
was
the
honorable
kedge
halloway
the
thinker
to
whose
paper
they
were
about
to
have
the
pleasure
and
improvement
of
listening
the
introduction
was
so
vehemently
applauded
that
had
there
been
present
a
person
connected
with
the
theatrical
profession
he
might
have
been
nervous
for
fear
the
introducer
had
prepared
no
encore
kedge
is
too
smart
to
take
it
all
to
himself
commented
martin
he
knows
it
half
account
of
the
man
that
said
he
was
not
mistaken
halloway
had
learned
a
certain
perceptiveness
on
the
stump
resting
one
hand
upon
his
unfolded
notes
upon
the
table
he
turned
toward
the
melancholy
young
man
who
had
subsided
into
the
small
of
his
back
in
his
chair
and
after
clearing
his
throat
observed
with
sudden
vehemence
that
he
must
thank
his
gifted
friend
for
his
flattering
remarks
but
that
when
he
said
that
carlow
envied
amo
a
halloway
it
must
be
replied
that
amo
grudged
no
glory
to
her
sister
county
of
carlow
but
if
amo
could
find
envy
in
her
heart
it
would
be
because
carlow
possessed
a
paper
so
sterling
so
upright
so
brilliant
so
enterprising
as
the
carlow
county
herald
and
a
journalist
so
talented
so
gifted
so
energetic
so
fearless
as
its
editor
the
gentleman
referred
to
showed
very
faint
appreciation
of
these
ringing
compliments
there
was
a
lamp
on
the
table
beside
him
against
which
to
the
view
of
miss
sherwood
of
rouen
his
face
was
silhouetted
and
very
rarely
had
it
been
her
lot
to
see
a
man
look
less
enthusiastic
under
public
and
favorable
comment
of
himself
she
wondered
if
he
also
remembered
the
muggleton
cricket
match
and
the
subsequent
dinner
oratory
the
lecture
proceeded
the
orator
winged
away
to
soary
heights
with
gestures
so
vigorous
as
to
cause
admiration
for
his
pluck
in
making
use
of
them
on
such
a
night
the
perspiration
streamed
down
his
face
his
neck
grew
purple
and
he
dared
the
very
face
of
apoplexy
binding
his
auditors
with
a
double
spell
it
is
true
that
long
before
the
peroration
the
windows
were
empty
and
the
boys
were
eating
stolen
unripe
fruit
in
the
orchards
of
the
listeners
the
thieves
were
sure
of
an
alibi
the
hon
halloway
reached
a
logical
conclusion
which
convinced
even
the
combative
and
unwilling
that
the
present
depends
largely
upon
the
past
while
the
future
will
be
determined
for
the
most
part
by
the
conditions
of
the
present
the
future
he
cried
leaning
forward
with
an
expression
of
solemn
warning
the
future
is
in
our
own
hands
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
city
of
plattville
is
it
not
so
we
will
find
it
so
turn
it
over
in
your
he
leaned
backward
and
folded
his
hands
benevolently
on
his
stomach
and
said
in
a
searching
whisper
ponder
he
waited
for
them
to
ponder
it
and
little
swanter
the
druggist
and
bookseller
who
prided
himself
on
his
politeness
and
who
was
seated
directly
in
front
scratched
his
head
and
knit
his
brows
to
show
that
he
was
pondering
it
the
stillness
was
intense
the
fans
ceased
to
beat
snoddy
could
be
heard
breathing
dangerously
swanter
was
considering
the
advisability
of
drawing
a
pencil
from
his
pocket
and
figuring
on
it
upon
his
cuff
when
suddenly
with
the
energy
of
a
whirlwind
the
lecturer
threw
out
his
arms
to
their
fullest
extent
and
roared
it
is
a
it
is
carven
on
stone
in
the
gloomy
caverns
of
time
it
is
writ
in
fire
on
the
imperishable
walls
of
fate
after
the
outburst
his
voice
sank
with
startling
rapidity
to
a
tone
of
honeyed
confidence
and
he
wagged
an
inviting
forefinger
at
snoddy
who
opened
his
mouth
shall
we
take
an
example
not
from
the
marvellous
my
friends
let
us
seek
an
illustration
from
the
ordinary
is
that
not
better
one
familiar
to
the
humblest
of
us
one
we
can
all
comprehend
one
from
our
life
one
which
will
interest
even
the
young
yes
the
common
on
a
we
place
a
bit
of
and
contiguous
to
it
a
flower
upon
which
the
happy
insect
likes
to
feed
and
rest
the
little
fly
approaches
see
he
hovers
between
the
two
one
is
a
fatal
trap
an
ambuscade
and
the
other
a
safe
harbor
and
an
innocuous
haven
but
mystery
allures
him
he
poises
undecided
that
is
the
present
that
my
friends
is
the
present
what
will
he
do
what
will
he
do
what

of
the
past
are
whispering

him

clearly
see
the
influence
of
the
past
upon
the
present

to

the

to
the

toothsomely
and

the

is
in

it
alone

away
from
there

warning
does
he
heed

ladies
and
gentlemen
does

ah
no

springs
into
the
air
decides
between
the
two
attractions
one
of
them
so
deadly
to
his
interests
and
upon
the
to
perish
the
future
is
in
his
hands
no
longer
we
must
lie
upon
the
bed
that
we
have
made
nor
can
providence
change
its
unalterable
after
the
tragedy
the
orator
took
a
swallow
of
water
mopped
his
brow
with
the
figured
handkerchief
and
announced
that
a
new
point
herewith
presented
itself
for
consideration
the
audience
sank
back
with
a
gasp
of
release
from
the
strain
of
attention
minnie
briscoe
leaning
back
breathless
like
the
others
became
conscious
that
a
tremor
agitated
her
visitor
miss
sherwood
had
bent
her
head
behind
the
shelter
of
the
judge
broad
shoulders
was
shaking
slightly
and
had
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
what
is
it
helen
whispered
miss
briscoe
anxiously
what
is
it
is
something
the
matter
nothing
nothing
she
dropped
her
hands
from
her
face
her
cheeks
were
deep
crimson
and
she
bit
her
lip
with
determination
oh
but
there
is
why
you
tears
in
your
eyes
are
you
faint
what
is
it
it
is
only
only
miss
sherwood
choked
then
cast
a
swift
glance
at
the
profile
of
the
melancholy
young
man
the
perfectly
dismal
decorum
of
this
gentleman
seemed
to
inspire
her
to
maintain
her
own
gravity
it
is
only
that
it
seemed
such
a
pity
about
that
fly
she
explained
from
where
they
sat
the
journalistic
silhouette
was
plainly
visible
and
both
fisbee
and
miss
sherwood
looked
toward
it
often
the
former
with
the
wistful
apologetic
fidelity
one
sees
in
the
eyes
of
an
old
setter
watching
his
master
when
the
lecture
was
over
many
of
the
audience
pressed
forward
to
shake
the
hon
halloway
hand
tom
martin
hooked
his
arm
in
that
of
the
sallow
gentleman
and
passed
out
with
him
mighty
humanizin
view
kedge
took
of
that
there
insect
remarked
martin
i
do
recollect
i
ever
heard
of
no
mournfuller
error
than
i
noticed
you
spoke
of
halloway
as
a
without
mentioning
what
kind
i
did
know
before
that
you
were
as
cautious
a
man
as
does
your
satire
find
nothing
sacred
martin
returned
the
other
not
even
the
honorable
kedge
halloway
i
would
presume
replied
old
tom
to
make
light
of
the
catastrophe
that
overtook
the
heedless
fly
when
halloway
went
on
to
other
subjects
i
was
so
busy
picturin
the
last
moments
of
that
closin
life
stuck
there
in
the
i
could
listen
to
him
but
there
no
use
dwellin
on
a
sorrow
we
ca
help
look
at
the
moon
it
full
enough
to
cheer
us
they
had
emerged
from
the
and
paused
on
the
street
as
the
stream
of
townsfolk
divided
and
passed
by
them
to
take
different
routes
leading
from
the
square
not
far
away
some
people
were
getting
into
a
buckboard
fisbee
and
miss
sherwood
were
already
on
the
rear
seat
who
with
him
fisbee
asked
judge
briscoe
in
a
low
voice
no
one
he
is
going
directly
to
the
office
is
thursday
one
of
our
days
of
oh
then
it
all
right
climb
in
minnie
we
waiting
for
the
judge
offered
his
hand
to
his
daughter
in
a
moment
father
she
answered
i
going
to
ask
him
to
call
she
said
to
the
other
girl
but
wo
he
miss
briscoe
laughed
he
never
comes
to
see
me
she
walked
over
to
where
martin
and
the
young
man
were
looking
up
at
the
moon
and
addressed
the
journalist
i
been
trying
to
get
a
chance
to
speak
to
you
for
a
week
she
said
offering
him
her
hand
i
wanted
to
tell
you
i
had
a
friend
coming
to
visit
me
wo
you
come
to
see
us
she
the
young
man
bowed
thank
you
he
answered
thank
you
very
much
i
shall
be
very
his
tone
had
the
meaningless
quality
of
perfunctory
courtesy
miss
briscoe
detected
only
the
courtesy
but
the
strange
lady
marked
the
lack
of
intention
in
his
words
do
you
include
me
minnie
inquired
mr
martin
plaintively
try
not
to
be
too
fascinatin
so
as
to
give
our
young
friend
a
show
it
was
love
at
first
sight
with
me
i
give
miss
seliny
warning
soon
as
your
folks
come
in
and
i
got
a
good
look
at
the
as
the
buckboard
drove
away
miss
sherwood
who
had
been
gazing
steadfastly
at
the
two
figures
still
standing
in
the
street
the
tall
ungainly
old
one
and
the
taller
young
one
he
had
not
turned
to
look
at
her
withdrew
her
eyes
from
them
bent
them
seriously
upon
fisbee
and
asked
what
did
you
mean
when
you
said
no
one
was
with
him
that
no
one
was
watching
him
he
answered
watching
him
i
do
yes
he
has
been
shot
at
from
the
woods
at
night
and
the
girl
shivered
but
who
watches
him
the
young
men
of
the
town
he
has
a
habit
of
taking
long
walks
after
dark
and
he
is
heedless
of
all
remonstrance
he
laughs
at
the
idea
of
curtailing
the
limit
of
his
strolls
or
keeping
within
the
town
when
night
has
fallen
so
the
young
men
have
organized
a
guard
for
him
and
every
evening
one
of
them
follows
him
until
he
goes
to
the
office
to
work
for
the
night
it
is
a
different
young
man
every
evening
and
the
watcher
follows
at
a
distance
so
that
he
does
not
but
how
many
people
know
of
this
arrangement
nearly
every
one
in
the
county
except
the
people
though
it
is
not
improbable
that
they
have
discovered
and
has
no
one
told
him
no
it
would
annoy
him
he
would
not
allow
it
to
continue
he
will
not
even
arm
they
follow
and
watch
him
night
after
night
and
every
one
knows
and
no
one
tells
him
oh
i
must
say
cried
the
girl
i
think
these
are
good
the
stalwart
old
man
on
the
front
seat
shook
out
the
reins
and
whined
the
whip
over
his
roans
backs
they
are
the
people
of
your
state
and
mine
miss
sherwood
he
said
in
his
hearty
voice
the
best
people
in
god
world
and
i
not
running
for
congress
either
but
how
about
the
people
father
asked
minnie
we
wipe
them
clean
out
some
day
answered
her
father
possibly
judicially
possibly
surely
judiciously
suggested
miss
sherwood
if
you
care
to
see
what
a
bad
settlement
looks
like
we
drive
through
there
by
daylight
said
briscoe
even
the
doctor
does
insist
on
being
in
that
neighborhood
after
dark
they
are
trying
their
best
to
get
harkless
and
if
they
do
if
they
do
repeated
miss
sherwood
she
clasped
fisbee
hand
gently
his
eyes
shone
and
he
touched
her
fingers
with
a
strange
shy
reverence
you
will
meet
him
he
said
she
laughed
and
pressed
his
hand
i
afraid
not
he
was
even
interested
enough
to
look
at
chapter
iii
lonesomeness
when
the
rusty
hands
of
the
office
clock
marked
four
the
of
the
carlow
county
herald
took
his
hand
out
of
his
hair
wiped
his
pen
on
his
last
notice
from
the
put
on
his
coat
swept
out
the
close
little
entry
and
left
the
sanctum
for
the
bright
june
afternoon
he
chose
the
way
to
the
west
strolling
thoughtfully
out
of
town
by
the
white
hot
deserted
main
street
and
thence
onward
by
the
country
road
into
which
its
proud
of
old
brick
store
buildings
frame
shops
and
thinly
painted
cottages
degenerated
the
sun
was
in
his
face
where
the
road
ran
between
the
summer
fields
lying
waveless
low
gracious
in
promise
but
coming
to
a
wood
of
hickory
and
beech
and
walnut
that
stood
beyond
he
might
turn
his
up
and
hold
his
head
erect
here
the
shade
fell
deep
and
cool
on
the
green
tangle
of
rag
and
iron
weed
and
long
grass
in
the
corners
of
the
snake
fence
although
the
sun
beat
upon
the
road
so
dose
beside
there
was
no
movement
in
the
crisp
young
leaves
overhead
high
in
the
boughs
there
was
a
quick
flirt
of
crimson
where
two
robins
hopped
noiselessly
no
insect
raised
resentment
of
the
lonesomeness
the
late
afternoon
when
the
air
is
quite
still
had
come
yet
there
rested
somewhere
on
the
quiet
day
a
faint
pleasant
woody
smell
it
came
to
the
editor
of
the
herald
as
he
climbed
to
the
top
rail
of
the
fence
for
a
seat
and
he
drew
a
long
deep
breath
to
get
the
elusive
odor
more
luxuriously
and
then
it
was
gone
altogether
a
habit
of
delicacies
he
said
aloud
addressing
the
wide
silence
complainingly
he
drew
a
faded
and
a
brier
pipe
from
his
coat
pocket
and
filled
and
lit
the
pipe
one
taste
and
they
quit
he
finished
gazing
solemnly
upon
the
shining
little
town
down
the
road
he
twirled
the
pouch
mechanically
about
his
finger
and
then
suddenly
regarding
it
patted
it
caressingly
it
had
been
a
giddy
little
bag
long
ago
satin
and
gay
with
embroidery
in
the
colors
of
the
university
and
although
now
it
was
frayed
to
the
verge
of
tatters
it
still
bore
an
air
of
pristine
jauntiness
an
air
of
which
its
owner
in
no
wise
partook
he
looked
from
it
over
the
fields
toward
the
town
in
the
clear
distance
and
sighed
softly
as
he
put
the
pouch
back
in
his
pocket
and
resting
his
arm
on
his
knee
and
his
chin
in
his
hand
sat
blowing
clouds
of
smoke
out
of
the
shade
into
the
sunshine
absently
watching
the
ghostly
shadows
dance
on
the
white
dust
of
the
road
a
little
garter
snake
crept
under
the
fence
beneath
him
and
disappeared
in
the
underbrush
a
rabbit
progressing
timidly
on
his
travels
by
a
series
of
brilliant
dashes
and
halts
came
within
a
few
yards
of
him
sat
up
with
quivering
nose
and
eyes
alight
with
fearful
imaginings
vanished
a
flash
of
fluffy
brown
and
white
shadows
grew
longer
the
brier
pipe
sputtered
feebly
in
depletion
and
was
refilled
a
cricket
chirped
and
heard
answer
there
was
a
woodland
stir
of
breezes
and
the
pair
of
robins
left
the
branches
overhead
in
eager
flight
vacating
before
the
arrival
of
a
great
flock
of
blackbirds
hastening
thither
ere
the
eventide
should
be
upon
them
the
blackbirds
came
chattered
gossiped
quarrelled
and
beat
each
other
with
their
wings
above
the
smoker
sitting
on
the
top
fence
rail
but
he
had
remembered
it
was
commencement
a
thousand
miles
to
the
east
a
company
of
grave
young
gentlemen
sat
in
rows
before
a
central
altar
while
above
them
rose
many
tiers
of
mothers
and
sisters
and
sweethearts
listening
to
the
final
word
he
could
see
it
all
very
clearly
the
lines
of
freshly
shaven
boyish
faces
the
dainty
gowns
the
flowers
and
bright
eyes
above
and
the
light
that
filtered
in
through
stained
glass
to
fall
softly
over
them
all
with
here
and
there
a
vivid
splash
of
color
gothic
shaped
he
could
see
the
throngs
of
loungers
under
the
elms
without
bored
by
the
latin
addresses
and
escaped
to
the
sward
and
breeze
of
the
campus
there
were
the
troops
of
roistering
graduates
trotting
about
arm
in
arm
and
singing
he
heard
the
mandolins
on
the
little
balconies
play
an
old
refrain
and
the
university
cheering
afterward
saw
the
old
professor
he
had
cared
for
most
of
all
with
the
thin
white
hair
straggling
over
his
silken
hood
following
the
band
in
the
sparse
ranks
of
his
class
and
he
saw
his
own
commencement
day
and
the
station
at
the
junction
where
he
stood
the
morning
after
looking
across
the
valley
at
the
old
towers
for
the
last
time
saw
the
broken
groups
of
his
class
standing
upon
the
platform
on
the
other
side
of
the
tracks
waiting
for
the
train
as
he
and
others
waited
for
the
and
they
all
sang
should
auld
acquaintance
be
forgot
and
while
they
looked
across
at
each
other
singing
the
shining
rails
between
them
wavered
and
blurred
as
the
engine
rushed
in
and
separated
them
and
their
lives
thenceforth
he
filled
his
pipe
again
and
spoke
to
the
phantoms
gliding
over
the
dust
seven
years
he
was
occupied
with
the
realization
that
there
had
been
a
man
in
his
class
whose
ambition
needed
no
restraint
his
promise
was
so
complete
in
the
strong
belief
of
the
university
a
belief
he
could
not
help
knowing
and
that
seven
years
to
a
day
from
his
commencement
this
man
was
sitting
on
a
fence
rail
in
indiana
down
the
road
a
buggy
came
creaking
toward
him
gray
with
dust
the
top
canted
permanently
to
one
side
old
and
frayed
like
the
fat
shaggy
gray
mare
that
drew
it
her
unchecked
despondent
head
lowering
before
her
while
her
incongruous
tail
waved
incessantly
like
the
banner
of
a
storming
party
the
editor
did
not
hear
the
flop
of
the
mare
feet
nor
the
sound
of
the
wheels
so
deep
was
his
reverie
till
the
vehicle
was
nearly
opposite
him
the
and
perspiring
driver
drew
rein
and
the
journalist
looked
up
and
waved
a
long
white
hand
to
him
in
greeting
howdy
do
harkless
called
the
man
in
the
buggy
soakin
in
the
weather
he
spoke
in
shouts
though
neither
was
hard
of
hearing
yes
just
soaking
answered
harkless
it
such
a
gypsy
day
how
is
bowlder

givin
good
satisfaction
thankye
and
all
at
home
she
in
town
goin
in
after
her
give
bowlder
my
regards
said
the
journalist
comprehending
the
symbolism
how
is
hartley
the
farmer
honest
face
shaded
over
a
second
he
steady
ever
sence
the
night
you
brought
him
out
home
six
weeks
straight
i
kind
of
bothered
about
it
and
he
wants
to
come
in
town
with
us
and
seems
if
i
had
any
call
to
say
no
i
reckon
he
have
to
take
his
chances
and
us
he
raised
the
reins
and
clucked
to
the
gray
mare
well
she
be
mad
i
ai
there
long
ago
ride
in
with
me
no
i
thank
you
i
walk
in
for
the
sake
of
my
would
encourage
it
much
livin
at
the
palace
hotel
observed
bowlder
sorry
ye
wo
he
gathered
the
loose
ends
of
the
reins
in
his
hands
leaned
far
over
the
dashboard
and
struck
the
mare
a
hearty
thwack
the
tattered
banner
of
tail
jerked
indignantly
but
she
consented
to
move
down
the
road
bowlder
thrust
his
big
head
through
the
behind
him
and
continued
the
conversation
see
the
ai
got
ye
no
not
harkless
laughed
reckon
the
boys
ye
stayed
in
town
after
dark
the
other
called
back
then
as
the
mare
stumbled
into
a
trot
well
come
out
and
see
us
if
ye
kin
spare
time
from
the
the
latter
clause
seemed
to
be
an
afterthought
intended
with
humor
for
bowlder
accompanied
it
with
the
loud
laughter
of
sylvan
timidity
risking
a
joke
harkless
nodded
without
the
least
apprehension
of
his
meaning
and
waved
farewell
as
bowlder
finally
turned
his
attention
to
the
mare
when
the
flop
flop
of
her
hoofs
had
died
out
the
journalist
realized
that
the
day
was
silent
no
longer
it
was
verging
into
evening
he
dropped
from
the
fence
and
turned
his
face
toward
town
and
supper
he
felt
the
light
and
life
about
him
heard
the
clatter
of
the
blackbirds
above
him
heard
the
homing
bees
hum
by
and
saw
the
vista
of
white
road
and
level
landscape
framed
on
two
sides
by
the
branches
of
the
grove
a
vista
of
infinitely
stretching
fields
of
green
lined
here
and
there
with
woodlands
and
flat
to
the
horizon
line
the
village
lying
in
their
lap
no
roll
of
meadow
no
rise
of
pasture
land
relieved
their
serenity
nor
shouldered
up
from
them
to
be
called
a
hill
a
second
great
flock
of
blackbirds
was
settling
down
over
the
plattville
maples
as
they
hung
in
the
fair
dome
of
the
sky
below
the
few
white
clouds
it
occurred
to
harkless
that
some
supping
god
had
inadvertently
peppered
his
custard
and
now
inverted
and
emptied
his
gigantic
blue
dish
upon
the
earth
the
innumerable
little
black
dots
seeming
to
poise
for
a
moment
then
floating
slowly
down
from
the
heights
a
rang
in
the
distance
a
tinkling
coming
small
and
mellow
from
far
away
and
at
the
lonesomeness
of
that
sound
he
heaved
a
long
mournful
sigh
the
next
instant
he
broke
into
laughter
for
another
bell
rang
over
the
fields
the
bell
in
the
square
the
first
four
strokes
were
given
with
mechanical
regularity
the
pride
of
the
custodian
who
operated
the
bell
being
to
produce
the
effect
of
a
bell
such
as
he
had
once
heard
in
the
at
rouen
but
the
fifth
and
sixth
strokes
were
halting
achievements
as
after
four
he
often
lost
count
on
the
strain
of
the
effort
for
precise
imitation
there
was
a
pause
after
the
sixth
then
a
dubious
and
reluctant
stroke
seven
a
longer
pause
followed
by
a
final
ring
with
desperate
decision
eight
harkless
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
twenty
minutes
of
six
as
he
crossed
the
yard
to
the
palace
hotel
he
stopped
to
exchange
a
word
with
the
who
seated
on
the
steps
was
mopping
his
brow
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
schofields
he
said
you
came
in
strong
on
the
last
stroke
what
we
need
here
responded
the
is
more
men
i
ai
kickin

harkless
no
sir
but
we
want
more
men

and
out

best

tom
martin
answered
harkless
it
only
half
the
time
he
means
anything
by
what
he
that
jest
what
i
hate
about
him
returned
the
in
a
tone
of
high
complaint
you
ca
never
tell
which
half
it
is
look
at
him
now
over
in
front
of
the
hotel
martin
was
standing
talking
to
the
row
of
coatless
loungers
who
sat
with
their
chairs
tilted
back
against
the
props
of
the
wooden
awning
that
projected
over
the
sidewalk
their
faces
were
turned
toward
the
and
even
those
lost
in
meditative
whittling
had
looked
up
to
laugh
martin
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
alpaca
coat
his
rusty
silk
hat
tilted
forward
till
the
wide
brim
rested
almost
on
the
bridge
of
his
nose
was
addressing
them
in
his
voice
the
melancholy
whine
of
which
though
not
the
words
penetrated
to
the
steps
the
whose
name
was
henry
schofield
but
who
was
known
as
schofield
henry
popularly
abbreviated
to
schofields
was
moved
to
indignation
look
at
him
he
cried
look
at
him
everlastingly
on
about
my
bell
let
him
talk
jest
let
him
the
supper
gong
boomed
inside
the
hotel
and
harkless
bade
the
as
he
moved
away
the
latter
called
after
him
he
do
disturb
nobody
let
him
talk
who
pays
any
to
him
i
like
to
know
there
was
a
burst
of
laughter
from
the
whittlers
schofields
sat
in
patient
silence
for
a
full
minute
as
one
who
knew
that
no
official
is
too
lofty
to
escape
the
anathemas
of
envy
then
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
shook
his
fist
at
martin
who
was
disappearing
within
the
door
of
the
hotel
go
to
halifax
he
shouted
the
of
the
palace
hotel
was
a
large
airy
apartment
rustling
with
artistically
perforated
and
slashed
pink
paper
that
hung
everywhere
at
this
season
of
the
year
to
lend
festal
effect
as
well
as
to
palliate
the
scourge
of
flies
there
were
six
or
seven
large
tables
all
vacant
except
that
at
which
columbus
landis
the
landlord
sat
with
his
guests
while
his
wife
and
children
ate
in
the
kitchen
by
their
own
preference
transient
trade
was
light
in
plattville
nobody
ever
came
there
except
occasional
commercial
travellers
who
got
out
of
town
the
instant
it
was
possible
and
who
said
awful
things
if
by
the
exigencies
of
the
railway
they
were
left
over
night
behind
the
host
chair
stood
a
girl
in
a
blue
cotton
gown
and
in
her
hand
she
languidly
waved
a
long
instrument
made
of
clustered
strips
of
green
and
white
and
yellow
tissue
paper
fastened
to
a
wooden
wand
with
this
she
amiably
amused
the
flies
except
at
such
times
as
the
conversation
proved
too
interesting
when
she
was
apt
to
rest
it
on
the
shoulder
of
one
of
the
guests
this
happened
each
time
the
editor
of
the
herald
joined
in
the
talk
as
the
men
seated
themselves
they
all
nodded
to
her
and
said
g
evening
harkless
always
called
her
charmion
no
one
knew
why
when
he
came
in
she
moved
around
the
table
to
a
chair
directly
opposite
him
and
held
that
station
throughout
the
meal
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
his
face
martin
noted
this
manoeuvre
it
occurred
regularly
twice
a
day
with
a
stealthy
smile
at
the
girl
and
her
light
skin
flushed
while
her
lip
curled
shrewishly
at
the
old
gentleman
oh
all
right
cynthy
he
whispered
to
her
and
chuckled
aloud
at
her
angry
toss
of
the
head
schofields
seemed
to
be
kind
of
put
out
with
me
this
evening
he
remarked
addressing
himself
to
the
company
he
the
most
ungratefullest
cuss
i
ever
come
up
with
i
was
only
oratin
on
how
proud
the
city
ought
to
be
of
him
he
fairly
keeps
plattville
spirit
on
the
gog
out
was
for
him
there
more
money
laid
on
him
whether
he
strike
over
and
above
the
hour
or
under
and
below
or
whether
he
strike
fifteen
minutes
before
time
or
twenty
after
than
well
sir
we
all
forgit
the
language
if
it
was
for
schofields
bell
to
keep
us
talkin
that
claim
dull
days
think
of
the
talk
he
furnishes
all
over
town
think
what
he
done
to
promote
conversation
now
for
instance
anna
belle
bardlock
got
a
beau
they
say
here
old
tom
tilted
back
in
his
chair
and
turned
an
innocent
eye
upon
a
youth
across
the
table
young
william
todd
who
was
blushing
over
his
and
i
hear
he
a
good
deal
scared
of
anna
belle
and
not
just
what
you
might
call
brash
with
her
they
say
every
sunday
night
he
go
up
to
bardlocks
and
call
on
anna
belle
from
six
till
nine
and
when
he
got
into
his
chair
he
sets
and
looks
at
the
floor
and
the
crayon
portraits
till
about
seven
then
he
opens
his
lips
and
says
schofields
must
be
on
his
way
to
the
by
this
time
and
about
an
hour
later
when
schofields
hits
four
or
five
he
speak
up
again
i
reckon
he
means
eight
towards
nine
they
say
he
skews
around
in
his
chair
and
says
if
he
strike
before
time
or
after
and
anna
belle
answers
out
loud
hope
after
for
politeness
but
in
her
soul
she
says
pray
before
and
then
schofields
hits
her
up
for
eighteen
or
twenty
and
anna
belle
company
reaches
for
his
hat
three
sundays
ago
he
turned
around
before
he
went
out
and
said
you
like
but
never
waited
to
find
out
it
the
same
programme
every
sunday
evening
and
jim
bardlock
says
anna
belle
so
worn
out
you
hardly
know
her
for
the
blithe
creature
she
was
last
year
the
excitement
too
much
for
her
poor
william
todd
bent
his
fiery
face
over
the
table
and
suffered
the
general
snicker
in
helpless
silence
then
there
was
quiet
for
a
space
broken
only
by
the
click
of
knives
against
the
heavy
china
and
the
indolent
rustle
of
cynthia
town
so
still
observed
the
landlord
finally
with
a
complacent
glance
at
the
dessert
course
of
prunes
to
which
his
guests
were
helping
themselves
from
a
central
reservoir
town
so
still
hardly
seems
like
come
round
again
yet
there
some
shore
signs
lately
when
my
shavers
come
honeyin
up
with
pa

todd
taking
occasion
to
prove
himself
recovered
from
confusion
remarked
casually
that
there
was
another
token
of
the
near
approach
of
the
circus
as
ole
wilkerson
was
drunk
again
there
a
man
exclaimed
martin
with
enthusiasm
the
feller
for
money
he
does
his
duty
as
a
citizen
more
on
public
occasions
than
any
man
i
ever
see
wilkerson
celebration
when
there
a
funeral
look
at
the
difference
between
it
and
on
fourth
of
july
why
sir
it
as
melancholy
as
a
and
sympathy
ai
the
word
for
it
when
he
looks
at
the
remains
no
sir
preacher
nor
undertaker
either
ai
as
blue
and
respectful
then

his
circus
spree

into
the
store
this
afternoon
head
up
marchin
like
a
grenadier
and
shootin
his
hand
out
before
his
face
and
drawin
it
back
again
and
hollering
out
ta
ta
why
the
dumbest
man
ever
lived
could
see
in
a
minute
show
and
wilkerson
playin
the
trombone
then
he
snort
and
goggle
like
an
elephant
got
the
biggest
sense
of
appropriateness
of
any
man
in
the
county
wilkerson
has
folks
half
appreciate
as
each
boarder
finished
his
meal
he
raided
the
glass
of
wooden
toothpicks
and
went
away
with
no
standing
on
the
order
of
his
going
but
martin
waited
for
harkless
who
not
having
attended
to
business
so
concisely
as
the
others
was
the
last
to
leave
the
table
and
they
stood
for
a
moment
under
the
awning
outside
lighting
their
cigars
call
on
the
judge
asked
martin
no
said
harkless
why
did
you
see
the
lady
with
minnie
and
the
judge
at
the
lecture
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
that
what
bowlder
meant
i
do
know
what
bowlder
meant
but
i
guess
you
better
go
out
there
young
man
she
might
not
stay
here
chapter
iv
the
walrus
and
the
carpenter
the
briscoe
buckboard
rattled
along
the
elastic
the
roans
setting
a
sharp
pace
as
they
turned
eastward
on
the
pike
toward
home
and
supper
they
make
the
eight
miles
in
of
an
hour
said
the
judge
proudly
he
pointed
ahead
with
his
whip
just
beyond
that
bend
we
pass
through
miss
sherwood
leaned
forward
eagerly
can
we
see
wimby
house
from
here
no
it
on
the
other
side
nearer
town
we
pass
it
later
it
the
only
house
in
this
they
reached
the
turn
of
the
road
and
the
judge
touched
up
his
colts
to
a
sharper
gait
no
need
of
dallying
he
observed
quietly
it
always
makes
me
a
little
sick
just
to
see
the
place
i
hate
to
have
a
they
came
in
sight
of
a
squalid
settlement
built
raggedly
about
a
blacksmith
shop
and
a
saloon
shanties
clustered
near
the
forge
a
few
roofs
scattered
through
the
shiftlessly
cultivated
fields
four
or
five
barns
propped
by
some
sheds
with
gaping
apertures
through
which
the
light
glanced
from
side
to
side
a
squad
of
thin
hogs
now
and
then
worried
by
gaunt
hounds
and
some
hens
groping
about
disconsolately
in
the
mire
a
buggy
with
a
twisted
wheel
settling
into
the
mud
of
the
middle
of
the
road
there
was
always
abundant
mud
here
in
the
dryest
summer
a
lowering
face
sneering
from
a
broken
window
was
forbidding
and
forlorn
enough
by
day
the
thought
of
what
might
issue
from
it
by
night
was
unpleasant
and
the
legends
of
the
together
with
an
unshapen
threat
easily
fancied
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
made
miss
sherwood
shiver
as
though
a
cold
draught
had
crossed
her
it
is
so
sinister
she
exclaimed
and
so
unspeakably
mean
this
is
where
they
live
the
people
who
hate
him
is
it
the
they
are
just
a
lot
of
rowdies
replied
briscoe
you
have
your
rough
corners
in
big
cities
and
i
expect
there
are
mighty
few
parts
of
any
country
that
do
have
their
tough
neighborhoods
only
happens
to
be
worse
than
most
they
choose
to
call
themselves
but
i
guess
it
just
a
name
they
like
to
give
themselves
usually
are
a
vigilance
committee
going
after
rascalities
the
law
does
reach
or
wo
reach
but
these
fellows
are
not
that
kind
they
got
together
to
wipe
out
their
grudges
and
sometimes
they
need
any
grudge
and
let
loose
their
deviltries
just
for
pure
orneriness
setting
haystacks
afire
and
such
like
or
where
a
farmer
had
offended
them
they
would
put
on
their
silly
toggery
and
take
him
out
at
midnight
and
whip
him
and
plunder
his
house
and
chase
the
horses
and
cattle
into
his
corn
maybe
they
say
the
women
went
with
them
on
their
and
he
was
the
first
to
try
to
stop
them
well
you
see
our
folks
are
pretty
briscoe
replied
apologetically
we
sort
of
got
used
to
the
meanness
of
the
it
took
a
stranger
to
stir
things
up
and
he
did
he
sent
eight
of
to
the
penitentiary
some
for
twenty
as
they
passed
the
saloon
a
man
stepped
into
the
doorway
and
looked
at
them
he
was
coatless
and
clad
in
garments
worn
to
the
color
of
dust
his
bare
head
was
curiously
malformed
higher
on
one
side
than
on
the
other
and
though
the
buckboard
passed
rapidly
and
at
a
distance
this
singular
lopsidedness
was
plainly
visible
to
the
occupants
lending
an
ugly
significance
to
his
meagre
yellow
face
he
was
tall
lean
hard
powerfully
built
he
eyed
the
strangers
with
affected
languor
and
then
when
they
had
gone
by
broke
into
sudden
loud
laughter
that
was
bob
skillett
the
worst
of
the
lot
said
the
judge
harkless
sent
his
son
and
one
brother
to
prison
and
it
nearly
broke
his
heart
that
he
could
swear
to
when
they
were
beyond
the
village
and
in
the
open
road
again
miss
sherwood
took
a
deep
breath
i
think
i
breathe
more
freely
she
said
that
was
a
hideous
laugh
he
sent
after
us
i
had
heard
of
places
like
this
before
and
i
do
think
i
care
to
see
many
of
them
as
i
understand
it
is
entirely
vicious
is
it
and
bears
the
same
relation
to
the
country
that
the
slums
do
to
a
city
that
about
it
they
make
their
own
whiskey
i
presume
and
they
have
their
own
fights
amongst
themselves
but
they
settle
themselves
too
and
keep
their
own
counsel
and
hush
it
up
lige
willetts
friend
i
guess
she
told
you
about
lige
well
lige
willetts
will
go
anywhere
when
he
following
a
covey
though
mostly
the
boys
leave
this
part
of
the
country
alone
when
they
hunting
but
lige
got
into
a
thicket
back
of
the
forge
one
morning
and
he
came
on
a
crowd
of
buzzards
quarrelling
over
a
heap
on
the
ground
and
he
got
out
in
a
hurry
he
said
he
was
sure
it
was
a
dog
but
he
ran
almost
all
the
way
to
father
exclaimed
his
daughter
leaning
from
the
back
seat
tell
such
stories
to
helen
she
think
we
horrible
and
frighten
her
well
it
is
exactly
a
lady
story
said
the
judge
he
glanced
at
his
guest
face
and
chuckled
i
guess
we
wo
frighten
her
much
he
went
on
young
lady
i
do
believe
you
be
afraid
of
many
things
would
you
you
do
look
like
it
besides
the
plattville
and
the
have
been
too
scared
to
do
anything
much
except
try
to
get
even
with
the
for
the
last
two
years
ever
since
it
went
for
them
they
laying
for
harkless
partly
for
revenge
and
partly
because
they
dare
do
anything
until
he
out
of
the
the
girl
gave
a
low
cry
with
a
sharp
intake
of
breath
ah
one
grows
tired
of
this
everlasting
american
patience
why
do
the
plattville
people
do
something
before
they
it
just
as
i
say
briscoe
answered
our
folks
are
sort
of
used
to
them
i
expect
we
do
about
all
we
can
the
boys
look
after
him
nights
and
the
main
trouble
is
that
we
ca
make
him
understand
he
ought
to
be
more
afraid
of
them
if
he
lived
here
all
his
life
he
would
be
you
know
there
an
feud
between
the
and
our
folks
goes
way
back
into
pioneer
history
and
mighty
few
know
anything
of
it
old
william
platt
and
the
forefathers
of
the
bardlocks
and
tibbses
and
briscoes
and
schofields
moved
up
here
from
north
carolina
a
good
deal
just
to
get
away
from
some
bad
neighbors
mostly
skilletts
and
johnsons
one
of
the
skilletts
had
killed
old
william
platt
two
sons
but
the
skilletts
and
johnsons
followed
all
the
way
to
indiana
to
join
in
making
the
new
settlement
and
they
shot
platt
at
his
cabin
door
one
night
right
where
the
stands
then
the
other
settlers
drove
them
out
for
good
and
they
went
seven
miles
west
and
set
up
a
still
a
band
of
indians
on
the
way
to
join
the
shawnee
prophet
at
tippecanoe
came
down
on
the
and
the
bought
them
off
with
bad
whiskey
and
sent
them
over
to
plattville
nearly
all
the
plattville
men
were
away
fighting
under
harrison
and
when
they
came
back
there
were
only
a
few
women
and
children
left
they
hid
in
the
woods
the
men
stopped
just
long
enough
to
hear
how
it
was
and
started
for
the
but
the
people
caught
them
in
an
ambush
and
not
many
of
our
folks
got
back
we
really
never
did
get
even
with
them
though
all
the
early
settlers
lived
and
died
still
expecting
to
see
the
day
when
plattville
would
go
over
and
pay
off
the
score
it
the
same
now
as
it
was
then
good
stock
with
us
bad
stock
over
here
and
all
the
country
in
creation
come
and
live
with
when
other
places
get
too
hot
to
hold
them
only
one
or
two
of
us
old
folks
know
what
the
original
trouble
was
about
but
you
ask
a
plattville
man
what
he
thinks
of
the
and
he
be
mighty
apt
to
say
guess
we
all
have
to
go
over
there
some
time
and
wipe
those
hoodlums
out
it
been
coming
to
that
a
long
time
the
work
the
did
has
come
nearer
bringing
us
even
with
than
anything
else
ever
has
queer
too
a
man
only
lived
in
plattville
a
few
years
to
be
settling
such
an
old
score
for
us
they
do
their
best
to
get
him
and
if
they
do
there
be
trouble
of
an
illegal
nature
i
think
our
people
would
go
over
there
again
but
i
expect
there
would
be
any
ambush
this
time
and
the
pioneers
might
rest
easier
in
he
broke
off
suddenly
and
nodded
to
a
little
old
man
in
a
buckboard
who
was
turning
off
from
the
road
into
a
farm
lane
which
led
up
to
a
trim
cottage
with
a
honeysuckle
vine
by
the
door
that
wimby
husband
said
the
judge
in
an
undertone
miss
sherwood
observed
that
mrs
wimby
husband
was
remarkable
for
the
exceeding
plaintiveness
of
his
expression
he
was
a
weazened
blank
little
man
with
a
thin
white
mist
of
neck
whisker
his
coat
was
so
large
for
him
that
the
sleeves
were
rolled
up
from
his
wrists
with
several
turns
and
as
he
climbed
painfully
to
the
ground
to
open
the
gate
of
the
lane
it
needed
no
perspicuous
eye
to
perceive
that
his
trousers
had
been
made
for
a
much
larger
man
for
as
his
uncertain
foot
left
the
step
of
his
vehicle
one
baggy
leg
of
the
garment
fell
down
over
his
foot
completely
concealing
his
boot
and
hanging
some
inches
beneath
a
faintly
vexed
expression
crossed
his
face
as
he
endeavored
to
arrange
the
disorder
but
he
looked
up
and
returned
briscoe
bow
sadly
with
an
air
of
explaining
that
he
was
accustomed
to
trouble
and
that
the
trousers
had
behaved
no
worse
than
he
expected
no
more
inoffensive
or
harmless
figure
than
this
feeble
little
old
man
could
be
imagined
yet
his
was
the
distinction
of
having
received
a
terrible
visit
from
his
neighbors
of
the
wimby
was
a
widow
who
owned
a
comfortable
farm
and
she
had
refused
every
offer
of
the
neighboring
bachelors
to
share
it
however
a
vagabonding
tinker
won
her
heart
and
after
their
marriage
she
continued
to
be
known
as
mrs
wimby
for
so
complete
was
the
insignificance
that
it
extended
to
his
name
which
proved
quite
unrememberable
and
he
was
usually
called
husband
or
more
simply
mr
the
bride
supplied
the
needs
of
his
wardrobe
with
the
garments
of
her
former
husband
and
alleging
this
proceeding
as
the
cause
of
their
anger
the
raiders
clad
as
broke
into
the
farmhouse
one
night
looted
it
tore
the
old
man
from
his
bed
and
compelling
his
wife
who
was
tenderly
devoted
to
him
to
watch
they
lashed
him
with
sapling
shoots
till
he
was
near
to
death
a
little
yellow
cur
that
had
followed
his
master
on
his
wanderings
was
found
licking
the
old
man
wounds
and
they
deluged
the
dog
with
kerosene
and
then
threw
the
poor
animal
upon
a
bonfire
they
had
made
and
danced
around
it
in
heartiest
enjoyment
the
man
recovered
but
that
was
no
palliation
of
the
offense
to
the
mind
of
a
young
man
from
the
east
who
was
besieging
the
county
authorities
for
redress
and
writing
brimstone
and
saltpetre
for
his
paper
the
powers
of
the
county
proving
either
lackadaisical
or
timorous
he
appealed
to
those
of
the
state
and
he
went
every
night
to
sleep
at
a
farmhouse
the
owner
of
which
had
received
a
warning
from
the
and
one
night
it
befell
that
he
was
rewarded
for
the
raiders
attempted
an
entrance
he
and
the
farmer
and
the
sons
beat
off
the
marauders
and
did
a
satisfactory
amount
of
damage
in
return
two
of
the
they
captured
and
bound
and
others
they
recognized
then
the
state
authorities
hearkened
to
the
voice
of
the
herald
and
its
owner
there
were
arrests
and
in
the
course
of
time
there
was
a
trial
every
prisoner
proved
an
alibi
could
have
proved
a
dozen
but
the
editor
of
the
herald
after
virtually
conducting
the
prosecution
went
upon
the
stand
and
swore
to
man
after
man
eight
men
went
to
the
penitentiary
on
his
evidence
five
of
them
for
twenty
years
the
plattville
brass
band
serenaded
the
editor
of
the
herald
again
there
were
no
more
raids
and
the
men
who
were
left
kept
to
their
hovels
appalled
and
shaken
but
as
time
went
by
and
left
them
unmolested
they
recovered
a
measure
of
their
hardiness
and
began
to
think
on
what
they
should
do
to
the
man
who
had
brought
misfortune
and
terror
upon
them
for
a
long
time
he
had
been
publishing
their
threatening
letters
and
warnings
in
a
column
which
he
headed
humor
of
the
harkless
do
understand
the
briscoe
said
to
miss
sherwood
as
they
left
the
wimby
farm
behind
and
then
he
like
most
of
us
hardly
any
of
us
realizes
that
harm
ever
going
to
come
to
harkless
was
anxious
enough
about
other
people
but
the
young
lady
interrupted
him
touching
his
arm
look
she
said
did
you
see
a
child
a
little
girl
ahead
of
us
on
the
road
i
noticed
one
a
minute
ago
but
she
not
there
now
answered
briscoe
there
was
a
child
walking
along
the
road
just
ahead
but
she
turned
and
saw
us
coming
and
she
disappeared
in
the
most
curious
way
she
seemed
to
melt
into
the
weeds
at
the
roadside
across
from
the
the
judge
pulled
in
the
horses
by
the
no
child
here
now
he
said
but
you
right
there
certainly
was
one
just
before
you
the
young
corn
was
low
in
the
fields
and
there
was
no
in
sight
i
very
superstitious
i
am
sure
it
was
an
imp
miss
sherwood
said
an
imp
or
a
very
large
chameleon
she
was
exactly
the
color
of
the
a
imp
said
the
judge
lifting
the
reins
and
in
that
case
we
might
as
well
give
up
i
never
set
up
to
be
a
match
for
those
people
and
the
children
are
as
mean
as
their
fathers
and
when
the
buckboard
had
rattled
on
a
hundred
yards
or
so
a
little
figure
clad
in
a
tattered
cotton
gown
rose
up
from
the
weeds
not
ten
feet
from
where
the
judge
had
drawn
rein
and
continued
its
march
down
the
road
toward
plattville
capering
in
the
dust
and
pursuing
the
buckboard
with
malignant
gestures
till
the
clatter
of
the
horses
was
out
of
hearing
the
vehicle
out
of
sight
something
over
two
hours
later
as
martin
was
putting
things
to
rights
in
his
domain
the
emporium
previous
to
his
departure
for
the
evening
gossip
and
checkers
at
the
he
stumbled
over
something
soft
lying
on
the
floor
behind
a
counter
the
thing
rose
and
would
have
evaded
him
but
he
put
out
his
hands
and
pinioned
it
and
dragged
it
to
the
where
the
light
of
the
fading
day
defined
his
capture
the
capture
shrieked
and
squirmed
and
fought
earnestly
grasped
by
the
shoulder
he
held
a
lean
undersized
girl
of
fourteen
clad
in
one
ragged
cotton
garment
unless
the
coat
of
dust
she
wore
over
all
may
be
esteemed
another
her
cheeks
were
sallow
and
her
brow
was
already
shrewdly
lined
and
her
eyes
were
as
hypocritical
as
they
were
savage
she
was
very
thin
and
little
but
old
tom
brown
face
grew
a
shade
nearer
white
when
the
light
fell
upon
her
you
no
plattville
girl
he
said
sharply
you
lie
cried
the
child
you
lie
i
am
you
leave
me
go
will
you
i
lookin
fer
pap
and
you
a
liar
you
crawled
in
here
to
sleep
after
your
walk
did
you
martin
went
on
you
a
liar
she
screamed
again
look
here
said
martin
slowly
you
go
back
to
and
tell
your
folks
that
if
anything
happens
to
a
hair
of
head
every
shanty
in
your
town
will
burn
and
your
grandfather
and
your
father
and
your
uncles
and
your
brothers
and
your
cousins
and
your
and
your
will
never
have
the
good
luck
to
see
the
penitentiary
reckon
you
can
remember
that
message
but
before
i
let
you
go
to
carry
it
i
guess
you
might
as
well
hand
out
the
paper
they
sent
you
over
here
his
prisoner
fell
into
a
paroxysm
of
rage
and
struck
at
him
i
git
pap
to
kill
ye
she
shrieked
i
don
know
nothin
yer
ner
no
papers
ner

harkels
neither
ner

ole
devil
pap
kill
ye
leave
me
go
leave
me
pap
kill
ye
i
git
him
to
ye
suddenly
her
struggles
ceased
her
eyes
closed
her
tense
little
muscles
relaxed
and
she
drooped
toward
the
floor
the
old
man
shifted
his
grip
to
support
her
and
in
an
instant
she
twisted
out
of
his
hands
and
sprang
out
of
reach
her
eyes
shining
with
triumph
and
venom
mister
she
shrilled
how
that
fer
hi
kill
ye
sunday
you
be
screechin
in
hell
in
a
week
an
we
set
up
an
drink
our
an
laff
martin
pursued
her
lumberingly
but
she
was
agile
as
a
monkey
and
ran
dodging
up
and
down
the
counters
and
mocked
him
singing
gran
mammy
till
at
last
she
tired
of
the
game
and
darted
out
of
the
door
flinging
back
a
hoarse
laugh
at
him
as
she
went
he
followed
but
when
he
reached
the
street
she
was
a
mere
shadow
flitting
under
the
courthouse
trees
he
looked
after
her
forebodingly
then
turned
his
eyes
toward
the
palace
hotel
the
editor
of
the
herald
was
seated
under
the
awning
with
his
chair
tilted
back
against
a
post
gazing
dreamily
at
the
murky
red
afterglow
in
the
west
what
the
use
of
tryin
to
bother
him
with
it
old
tom
asked
himself
he
only
he
noted
that
young
william
todd
sat
near
the
editor
whittling
absently
martin
chuckled
william
turn
he
muttered
well
the
boys
take
mighty
good
care
of
he
locked
the
doors
of
the
emporium
tried
them
and
dropped
the
keys
in
his
pocket
as
he
crossed
the
square
to
the
where
his
cronies
awaited
him
he
turned
again
to
look
at
the
figure
of
the
musing
journalist
i
hope
he
go
out
to
the
judge
he
said
and
shook
his
head
sadly
i
do
reckon
plattville
any
too
spry
for
that
young
man
five
years
he
here
well
it
a
good
thing
for
us
folks
but
i
guess
it
ai
exactly
for
he
kicked
a
stick
out
of
his
way
impatiently
now
where
that
imp
run
to
he
grumbled
the
imp
was
lying
under
the
steps
when
the
sound
of
martin
footsteps
had
passed
away
she
crept
cautiously
from
her
and
stole
through
the
ungroomed
grass
to
the
fence
opposite
the
hotel
here
she
stretched
herself
flat
in
the
weeds
and
took
from
underneath
the
tangled
masses
of
her
hair
where
it
was
tied
with
a
string
a
crumpled
slip
of
greasy
paper
with
this
in
her
fingers
she
lay
peering
under
the
fence
her
fierce
eyes
fixed
unwinkingly
on
harkless
and
the
youth
sitting
near
him
the
street
ran
flat
and
gray
in
the
slowly
gathering
dusk
straight
to
the
western
horizon
where
the
sunset
embers
were
strewn
in
long
streaks
the
maple
trees
were
silhouettes
against
the
pale
rose
and
pearl
tints
of
the
sky
above
and
a
tenderness
seemed
to
tremble
in
the
air
harkless
often
vowed
to
himself
he
would
watch
no
more
sunsets
in
plattville
he
realized
that
their
loveliness
lent
a
too
unhappy
tone
to
the
imaginings
and
introspections
upon
which
he
was
thrown
by
the
loneliness
of
the
environment
and
he
considered
that
he
had
too
much
time
in
which
to
think
about
himself
for
five
years
his
introspections
had
monotonously
hurled
one
word
at
him
failure
failure
failure
he
thought
the
sunsets
were
making
him
morbid
could
he
have
shared
them
that
would
have
been
different
his
long
melancholy
face
grew
longer
and
more
melancholy
in
the
twilight
while
william
todd
patiently
whittled
near
by
plattville
had
often
discussed
the
editor
habit
of
silence
and
martin
had
suggested
that
possibly
the
reason
harkless
was
such
a
quiet
man
was
that
there
was
nobody
for
him
to
talk
to
his
hearers
did
not
agree
for
the
population
of
carlow
county
was
a
thing
of
pride
being
greater
than
that
of
several
bordering
counties
they
did
agree
however
that
harkless
quiet
was
not
unkind
whatever
its
cause
and
that
when
it
was
broken
it
was
usually
broken
to
conspicuous
effect
perhaps
it
was
because
he
wrote
so
much
that
he
hated
to
talk
a
bent
figure
came
slowly
down
the
street
and
william
hailed
it
cheerfully
evening
a
good
evening
todd
answered
the
old
man
pausing
ah
harkless
i
was
looking
for
he
had
not
seemed
to
be
looking
for
anything
beyond
the
boundaries
of
his
own
dreams
but
he
approached
harkless
tugging
nervously
at
some
papers
in
his
pocket
i
have
completed
my
notes
for
our
saturday
edition
it
was
quite
easy
there
is
much
thank
you
fisbee
said
harkless
as
he
took
the
manuscript
have
you
finished
your
paper
on
the
earlier
christian
symbolism
i
hope
the
may
have
the
honor
of
printing
this
was
the
form
they
used
i
shall
be
the
recipient
of
honor
sir
returned
fisbee
your
kind
offer
will
speed
my
work
but
i
fear
harkless
i
very
much
fear
that
your
kindness
alone
prompts
it
for
deeply
as
i
desire
it
i
can
not
truthfully
say
that
my
essays
appear
to
increase
our
he
made
an
odd
troubled
gesture
as
he
went
on
they
do
not
seem
to
read
them
here
harkless
although
martin
assures
me
that
he
carefully
peruses
my
article
on
chaldean
decoration
whenever
he
rearranges
his
exhibition
windows
and
i
bear
in
mind
the
clipping
from
a
rouen
paper
you
showed
me
commenting
generously
upon
the
scholarship
of
the
but
for
fifteen
years
i
have
tried
to
improve
the
art
feeling
in
plattville
and
i
may
say
that
i
have
worked
in
the
face
of
no
small
discouragement
in
fact
there
was
a
slight
quaver
in
fisbee
voice
i
can
not
remember
that
i
ever
received
the
slightest
word
or
token
of
encouragement
till
you
came
harkless
since
then
i
have
labored
with
refreshed
energy
still
i
can
not
claim
that
our
architecture
shows
a
change
for
the
better
and
i
fear
the
engravings
upon
the
walls
of
our
people
exhibit
no
great
progress
in
selection
and
i
i
wish
also
to
say
harkless
if
you
find
it
necessary
to
make
some
alterations
in
the
form
of
my
reportorial
items
for
issue
i
shall
perfectly
understand
remembering
your
explanation
that
journalism
demands
it
harkless
he
plodded
on
a
few
paces
then
turned
irresolutely
what
is
it
fisbee
asked
harkless
fisbee
stood
for
a
moment
as
though
about
to
speak
then
he
smiled
faintly
shook
his
head
and
went
his
way
harkless
stared
after
him
surprised
it
suddenly
struck
him
with
a
feeling
of
irritation
that
if
fisbee
had
spoken
it
would
have
been
to
advise
him
to
call
at
judge
briscoe
he
laughed
impatiently
at
the
notion
and
drawing
his
pencil
and
a
pad
from
his
pocket
proceeded
to
injure
his
eyes
in
the
waning
twilight
by
the
editorial
perusal
of
the
items
his
staff
had
just
left
in
his
hands
when
published
the
manuscript
came
under
a
flaring
heading
bequeathed
by
harkless
predecessor
in
the
chair
of
the
herald
and
the
alteration
of
which
he
felt
plattville
would
refuse
to
sanction
happenings
of
our
below
was
printed
in
smaller
type
improvements
in
the
world
of
business
and
beneath
that
came
the
rubric
also
the
cradle
the
altar
and
the
the
first
of
fisbee
items
was
thus
recorded
it
may
be
noted
that
the
new
of
miller
has
been
put
in
place
we
can
not
but
regret
that
miller
did
not
instruct
the
painter
to
confine
himself
to
a
simpler
method
of
ah
fisbee
murmured
the
editor
reproachfully
that
new
is
almost
the
only
improvement
in
the
world
of
business
plattville
has
seen
this
year
i
wonder
how
many
times
we
have
used
it
from
the
first
is
rumored
in
business
circles
that
herve
miller
contemplates
to
the
exciting
way
and
touches
my
poor
white
knight
are
five
years
of
training
wasted
on
you
sometimes
you
make
me
fear
it
here
is
plattville
panting
for
our
story
of
the
hanging
of
the
sign
and
you
throw
away
the
climax
like
that
he
began
to
write
rapidly
bending
low
over
the
pad
in
the
half
darkness
his
narrative
was
an
amplification
of
the
interesting
information
already
possessed
by
every
inhabitant
that
herve
miller
had
put
up
a
new
sign
after
a
paragraph
of
handsome
description
herve
is
always
enterprising
wrote
the
editor
this
is
a
move
in
the
right
direction
herve
keep
it
he
glanced
over
the
other
items
meditatively
making
alterations
here
and
there
the
last
two
fisbee
had
written
as
follows
there
is
noticeable
in
the
new
and
somewhat
incongruous
portico
erected
by
solomon
tibbs
at
the
residence
of
henry
tibbs
willetts
an
attempt
at
rococo
decoration
which
can
not
fail
to
sadden
the
miss
sherwood
of
rouen
whom
miss
briscoe
knew
at
the
misses
in
new
york
is
a
guest
of
judge
briscoe
fisbee
items
were
written
in
ink
and
there
was
a
blank
space
beneath
the
last
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
something
had
been
scribbled
in
pencil
harkless
tried
vainly
to
decipher
it
but
the
twilight
had
fallen
too
deep
and
the
writing
was
too
faint
so
he
struck
a
match
and
held
it
close
to
the
paper
the
action
betokened
only
a
languid
interest
but
when
he
caught
sight
of
the
first
of
the
four
subscribed
lines
he
sat
up
straight
in
his
chair
with
an
ejaculation
at
the
bottom
of
fisbee
page
was
written
in
a
dainty
feminine
hand
of
a
type
he
had
not
seen
for
years
time
has
come
the
walrus
said
talk
of
many
things
of
shoes
and
ships
and
and
cabbages
and
kings
he
put
the
paper
in
his
pocket
and
set
off
rapidly
down
the
village
street
at
his
departure
william
todd
looked
up
quickly
then
he
got
upon
his
feet
and
quietly
followed
the
editor
in
the
dusk
a
tattered
little
figure
rose
up
from
the
weeds
across
the
way
and
stole
noiselessly
after
william
he
was
in
his
his
waistcoat
unbuttoned
and
loose
on
the
nearest
corner
todd
encountered
a
who
had
been
pacing
up
and
down
in
front
of
a
cottage
crooning
to
a
protestive
baby
held
in
his
arms
he
had
paused
in
his
vigil
to
stare
after
harkless
whereas
he
bound
for
william
inquired
the
man
with
the
baby
briscoes
answered
william
pursuing
his
way
i
reckoned
he
would
be
commented
the
other
turning
to
his
wife
who
sat
on
the
doorstep
i
reckoned
so
when
i
see
that
lady
at
the
lecture
last
the
woman
rose
to
her
feet
hi
bill
todd
she
said
what
you
got
onto
the
back
of
your
vest
william
paused
put
his
hand
behind
him
and
encountered
a
paper
pinned
to
the
dangling
strap
of
his
waistcoat
the
woman
ran
to
him
and
unpinned
the
paper
it
bore
a
writing
they
took
it
to
where
the
yellow
shone
through
the
open
door
and
read
der
sir
foler
harkls
al

harkls
not
got

we
come
in
what
ye
think
william
asked
the
man
with
the
baby
anxiously
but
the
woman
gave
the
youth
a
sharp
push
with
her
hand
they
never
dast
to
do
it
she
cried
never
in
the
world
you
hurry
bill
todd
do
you
leave
him
out
of
your
sight
one
chapter
at
the
pasture
bars
may
have
stings
the
street
upon
which
the
palace
hotel
fronted
formed
the
south
side
of
the
square
and
ran
west
to
the
edge
of
the
town
where
it
turned
to
the
south
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
more
then
bent
to
the
west
again
some
distance
from
this
second
turn
there
stood
fronting
close
on
the
road
a
large
brick
house
the
most
pretentious
mansion
in
carlow
county
and
yet
it
was
a
homelike
place
with
its
walls
embowered
in
masses
of
cool
virginia
creeper
and
a
comfortable
veranda
crossing
the
broad
front
while
half
a
hundred
stalwart
sentinels
of
elm
and
beech
and
poplar
stood
guard
around
it
the
front
walk
was
bordered
by
geraniums
and
hollyhocks
and
honeysuckle
climbed
the
pillars
of
the
porch
behind
the
house
there
was
a
shady
little
orchard
and
back
of
the
orchard
an
very
fragrant
divided
by
a
long
grape
arbor
extended
to
the
shallow
waters
of
a
wandering
creek
and
on
the
bank
a
rustic
seat
was
placed
beneath
the
sycamores
from
the
first
bend
of
the
road
where
it
left
the
town
and
became
after
some
indecision
a
country
highway
called
the
pike
rather
than
a
proud
city
boulevard
a
pathway
led
through
the
fields
to
end
at
some
pasture
bars
opposite
the
brick
house
john
harkless
was
leaning
on
the
pasture
bars
the
stars
were
wan
and
the
full
moon
shone
over
the
fields
meadows
and
woodlands
lay
quiet
under
the
old
sweet
marvel
of
a
june
night
in
the
wide
monotony
of
the
flat
lands
there
sometimes
comes
a
feeling
that
the
whole
earth
is
stretched
out
before
one
it
seemed
to
lie
so
in
the
pathos
of
silent
beauty
all
passive
and
still
yet
breathing
an
antique
message
sad
mysterious
reassuring
but
there
had
come
a
divine
melody
adrift
on
the
air
through
the
open
windows
it
floated
indoors
some
one
struck
a
peal
of
silver
chords
like
a
harp
touched
by
a
lover
and
a
voice
was
lifted
john
harkless
leaned
on
the
pasture
bars
and
listened
with
upraised
head
and
parted
lips
to
thy
chamber
window
roving
love
hath
led
my
the
lord
sent
manna
to
the
children
of
israel
in
the
wilderness
harkless
had
been
five
years
in
plattville
and
a
woman
voice
singing
schubert
serenade
came
to
him
at
last
as
he
stood
by
the
pasture
bars
of
jones
field
and
listened
and
rested
his
dazzled
eyes
on
the
big
white
face
of
the
moon
how
long
had
it
been
since
he
had
heard
a
song
or
any
discourse
of
music
other
than
that
furnished
by
the
plattville
band
not
that
he
had
not
taste
for
a
brass
band
but
music
that
he
loved
always
gave
him
an
ache
of
delight
and
the
twinge
of
reminiscences
of
old
gay
days
gone
forever
his
memory
leaped
to
the
last
day
of
a
june
gone
seven
years
to
a
morning
when
the
little
estuary
waves
twinkled
in
the
bright
sun
about
the
boat
in
which
he
sat
the
trim
launch
that
brought
a
cheery
party
ashore
from
their
schooner
to
the
casino
landing
at
winter
harbor
far
up
on
the
maine
coast
it
was
the
happiest
of
those
last
irresponsible
days
before
he
struck
into
his
work
in
the
world
and
became
a
failure
he
saw
the
picture
as
plainly
as
if
it
were
yesterday
no
reminiscence
had
risen
so
keenly
before
his
eyes
for
years
pretty
van
skuyt
sitting
beside
him
pretty
van
skuyt
and
her
roses
what
had
become
of
her
he
saw
the
crowd
of
friends
waiting
on
the
pier
for
their
arrival
and
the
dozen
or
so
emblazoned
classmates
it
was
in
the
time
of
brilliant
flannels
who
suddenly
sent
up
a
volley
of
college
cheers
in
his
honor
how
plainly
the
dear
old
young
faces
rose
up
before
him
the
men
from
whose
lives
he
had
slipped
dearest
and
jolliest
of
the
faces
was
that
of
tom
meredith
clubmate
classmate
his
closest
friend
the
thin
third
baseman
he
could
see
tom
mouth
opened
at
least
a
yard
it
seemed
such
was
his
frantic
vociferousness
again
and
again
the
cheers
rang
out
harkless
harkless
on
the
end
of
them
in
those
days
everybody
particularly
his
classmates
thought
he
would
be
minister
to
england
in
a
few
years
and
the
orchestra
on
the
casino
porch
was
playing
the
conquering
hero
in
his
honor
and
at
the
behest
of
tom
meredith
he
knew
there
were
other
pretty
ladies
besides
van
skuyt
in
the
from
the
yacht
but
as
they
touched
the
pier
pretty
girls
or
pretty
women
or
jovial
gentlemen
all
were
overlooked
in
the
wild
scramble
the
college
men
made
for
their
hero
they
haled
him
forth
set
him
on
high
bore
him
on
their
shoulders
shouting
skal
to
the
viking
and
carried
him
up
the
wooded
bluff
to
the
casino
he
heard
van
skuyt
say
oh
we
used
to
it
we
put
in
at
several
other
places
where
he
had
friends
he
struggled
manfully
to
be
set
down
but
his
triumphal
procession
swept
on
he
heard
bystanders
telling
each
other
it
that
young
harkless
great
harkless
they
all
so
mad
about
and
while
it
pleased
him
a
little
to
hear
such
things
they
always
made
him
laugh
a
great
deal
he
had
never
understood
his
popularity
he
had
been
chief
editor
of
the
university
daily
and
he
had
done
a
little
in
athletics
and
the
rest
of
his
distinction
lay
in
college
offices
his
mates
had
heaped
upon
him
without
his
being
able
to
comprehend
why
they
did
it
and
yet
somehow
and
in
spite
of
himself
they
had
convinced
him
that
the
world
was
his
oyster
that
it
would
open
for
him
at
a
touch
he
could
not
help
seeing
how
the
freshmen
looked
at
him
how
the
sophomores
jumped
off
the
narrow
campus
walks
to
let
him
pass
he
could
not
help
knowing
that
he
was
the
great
man
of
his
time
so
that
the
great
harkless
came
to
be
one
of
the
traditions
of
the
university
he
remembered
the
wild
progress
they
made
for
him
up
the
slope
that
morning
at
winter
harbor
how
the
people
baked
on
and
laughed
and
clapped
their
hands
but
at
the
veranda
edge
he
had
noticed
a
little
form
disappearing
around
a
corner
of
the
building
a
young
girl
running
away
as
fast
as
she
could
see
there
he
said
as
the
tribe
set
him
down
you
have
frightened
the
and
tom
meredith
stopped
shouting
long
enough
to
answer
it
my
little
cousin
overcome
with
emotion
she
been
counting
the
hours
till
you
came
been
hearing
of
you
from
me
and
others
for
a
good
while
and
has
been
able
to
talk
or
think
of
anything
else
only
fifteen
and
the
crucial
moment
is
too
much
for
her
the
great
harkless
has
arrived
and
she
has
he
remembered
other
incidents
of
his
greatness
of
the
glory
that
now
struck
him
as
rarely
comical
he
hoped
he
had
taken
it
too
seriously
then
in
the
flush
of
his
youth
maybe
after
all
he
had
been
a
boy
but
he
must
have
bottled
up
his
conceit
tightly
enough
or
the
other
boys
would
have
detected
it
and
abhorred
him
he
was
inclined
to
believe
that
he
had
not
been
very
much
set
up
by
the
pomp
they
made
for
him
at
all
events
that
day
at
winter
harbor
had
been
beautiful
full
of
the
laughter
of
friends
and
music
for
there
was
a
musicale
at
the
casino
in
the
afternoon
but
the
present
hour
grew
on
him
as
he
leaned
on
the
pasture
bars
and
suddenly
his
memories
sped
and
the
voice
that
was
singing
serenade
across
the
way
touched
him
with
the
urgent
personal
appeal
that
a
present
beauty
always
had
for
him
it
was
a
soprano
and
without
tremolo
yet
came
to
his
ear
with
a
certain
tremulous
sweetness
it
was
soft
and
slender
but
the
listener
knew
it
could
be
lifted
with
fullness
and
power
if
the
singer
would
it
spoke
only
of
the
song
yet
the
listener
thought
of
the
singer
under
the
moon
thoughts
run
into
dreams
and
he
dreamed
that
the
owner
of
the
voice
she
who
quoted
the
walrus
and
the
carpenter
on
fisbee
notes
was
one
to
laugh
with
you
and
weep
with
you
yet
her
laughter
would
be
tempered
with
sorrow
and
her
tears
with
laughter
when
the
song
was
ended
he
struck
the
rail
he
leaned
upon
a
sharp
blow
with
his
open
hand
there
swept
over
him
a
feeling
that
he
had
stood
precisely
where
he
stood
now
on
such
a
night
a
thousand
years
ago
had
heard
that
voice
and
that
song
had
listened
and
been
moved
by
the
song
and
the
night
just
as
he
was
moved
now
he
had
long
known
himself
for
a
sentimentalist
he
had
almost
given
up
trying
to
cure
himself
and
he
knew
himself
for
a
born
lover
he
had
always
been
in
love
with
some
one
in
his
earlier
youth
his
affections
had
been
so
constantly
inconstant
that
he
finally
came
to
settle
with
his
by
recognizing
in
himself
a
fine
constancy
that
worshipped
one
woman
always
it
was
only
the
shifting
image
of
her
that
changed
somewhere
he
dreamed
whimsically
indulgent
of
the
fancy
yet
mocking
himself
for
it
there
was
a
girl
whom
he
had
never
seen
who
waited
till
he
should
come
she
was
everything
until
he
found
her
he
could
not
help
adoring
others
who
possessed
little
pieces
and
suggestions
of
her
her
brilliancy
her
courage
her
short
upper
lip
like
a
curled
roseleaf
or
her
dear
voice
or
her
pure
profile
he
had
no
recollection
of
any
lady
who
had
quite
her
eyes
he
had
never
passed
a
lovely
stranger
on
the
street
in
the
old
days
without
a
thrill
of
delight
and
warmth
if
he
never
saw
her
again
and
the
vision
only
lasted
the
time
it
takes
a
lady
to
cross
the
sidewalk
from
a
shop
door
to
a
carriage
he
was
always
a
little
in
love
with
her
because
she
bore
about
her
somewhere
as
did
every
pretty
girl
he
ever
saw
a
suggestion
of
the
divinity
one
does
not
pass
lovely
strangers
in
the
streets
of
plattville
miss
briscoe
was
pretty
but
not
at
all
in
the
way
that
harkless
dreamed
for
five
years
the
lover
in
him
that
had
loved
so
often
had
been
starved
of
all
but
dreams
only
at
twilight
and
dusk
in
the
summer
when
strolling
he
caught
sight
of
a
woman
skirt
far
up
the
village
street
in
the
darkness
under
the
cathedral
arch
of
meeting
branches
this
romancer
of
petticoats
could
sigh
a
true
lover
sigh
and
if
he
kept
enough
distance
between
fly
a
yearning
fancy
that
his
lady
wandered
there
ever
since
his
university
days
the
image
of
her
had
been
growing
more
and
more
distinct
he
had
completely
settled
his
mind
as
to
her
appearance
and
her
voice
she
was
tall
almost
too
tall
he
was
sure
of
that
and
out
of
his
consciousness
there
had
grown
a
sweet
and
vivacious
young
face
that
he
knew
was
hers
her
hair
was
with
gold
lustres
he
reveled
in
the
gold
lustres
on
the
proper
theory
that
when
your
fancy
is
painting
a
picture
you
may
as
well
go
in
for
the
whole
thing
and
make
it
sumptuous
and
her
eyes
were
gray
they
were
very
earnest
and
yet
they
sparkled
and
laughed
to
him
companionably
and
sometimes
he
had
smiled
back
upon
her
the
undine
danced
before
him
through
the
lonely
years
on
fair
nights
in
his
walks
and
came
to
sit
by
his
fire
on
winter
evenings
when
he
stared
alone
at
the
embers
and
here
in
plattville
he
heard
a
voice
he
had
waited
for
long
one
that
his
fickle
memory
told
him
he
had
never
heard
before
but
listening
he
knew
better
he
had
heard
it
long
ago
though
when
and
how
he
did
not
know
as
rich
and
true
and
ineffably
tender
as
now
he
threw
a
sop
to
his
common
sense
miss
sherwood
is
a
little
thing
the
image
was
so
surely
tall
with
a
bumpy
forehead
and
spectacles
he
said
to
himself
or
else
a
provincial
young
lady
with
big
eyes
to
pose
at
then
he
felt
the
ridiculousness
of
looking
after
his
common
sense
on
a
moonlight
night
in
june
also
he
knew
that
he
lied
the
song
had
ceased
but
the
musician
lingered
and
the
keys
were
touched
to
plaintive
harmonies
new
to
him
he
had
come
to
plattville
before
cavalleria
rusticana
was
sung
at
rome
and
now
entranced
he
heard
the
intermezzo
for
the
first
time
listening
to
this
he
feared
to
move
lest
he
should
wake
from
a
dream
a
ragged
little
shadow
flitted
down
the
path
behind
him
and
from
a
solitary
standing
like
a
lonely
ghost
in
the
middle
of
the
field
came
the
of
a
screech
owl
twice
it
was
answered
twice
from
a
clump
of
that
grew
in
a
fifty
yards
west
of
the
pasture
bars
then
the
barrel
of
a
squirrel
rifle
issued
lifted
out
of
the
white
and
lay
along
the
fence
the
music
in
the
house
across
the
way
ceased
and
harkless
saw
two
white
dresses
come
out
through
the
long
parlor
windows
to
the
veranda
it
will
be
cooler
out
here
came
the
voice
of
the
singer
clearly
through
the
quiet
what
a
night
john
vaulted
the
bars
and
started
to
cross
the
road
they
saw
him
from
the
veranda
and
miss
briscoe
called
to
him
in
welcome
as
his
tall
figure
stood
out
plainly
in
the
bright
light
against
the
white
dust
a
streak
of
fire
leaped
from
the
and
there
rang
out
the
sharp
report
of
a
rifle
there
were
two
screams
from
the
veranda
one
white
figure
ran
into
the
house
the
other
a
little
one
with
a
gauzy
wrap
streaming
behind
came
flying
out
into
the
moonlight
straight
to
harkless
there
was
a
second
report
the
was
answered
by
a
revolver
william
todd
had
risen
up
apparently
from
nowhere
and
kneeling
by
the
pasture
bars
fired
at
the
flash
of
the
rifle
jump
fer
the
shadder
harkless
he
shouted
he
in
them
elders
and
then
fer
god
sake
comeback
as
he
was
the
editor
dashed
for
the
treacherous
as
fast
as
his
long
legs
could
carry
him
but
before
he
had
taken
six
strides
a
hand
clutched
his
sleeve
and
a
girl
voice
quavered
from
close
behind
him
do
run
like
that
harkless
i
ca
keep
up
he
wheeled
about
and
confronted
a
vision
a
dainty
little
figure
about
five
feet
high
a
flushed
and
lovely
face
hair
and
draperies
disarranged
and
flying
he
stamped
his
foot
with
rage
get
back
in
the
house
he
cried
you
must
go
she
panted
it
the
only
way
to
stop
go
back
to
the
house
he
shouted
savagely
will
you
come
fer
god
sake
cried
william
todd
come
back
keep
out
of
the
he
was
emptying
his
revolver
at
the
clump
of
elder
the
uproar
of
his
firing
blasting
the
night
some
one
screamed
from
the
house
helen
helen
john
seized
the
girl
wrists
roughly
her
gray
eyes
flashed
into
his
defiantly
will
you
go
he
roared
no
he
dropped
her
wrists
caught
her
up
in
his
arms
as
if
she
had
been
a
kitten
and
leaped
into
the
shadow
of
the
trees
that
leaned
over
the
road
from
the
yard
the
rifle
rang
out
again
and
the
little
ball
whistled
venomously
overhead
harkless
ran
along
the
fence
and
turned
in
at
the
gate
a
loose
strand
of
the
girl
hair
blew
across
his
cheek
and
in
the
moon
her
head
shone
with
gold
she
had
hair
and
gray
eyes
and
a
short
upper
lip
like
a
curled
he
set
her
down
on
the
veranda
steps
both
of
them
laughed
wildly
but
you
came
with
me
she
gasped
triumphantly
i
always
thought
you
were
tall
he
answered
and
there
was
afterward
a
time
when
he
had
to
agree
that
this
was
a
somewhat
vague
reply
chapter
vi
june
judge
briscoe
smiled
grimly
and
leaned
on
his
in
the
moonlight
by
the
veranda
he
and
william
todd
had
been
trampling
down
the
and
returning
to
the
house
found
minnie
alone
on
the
porch
safe
he
said
to
his
daughter
who
turned
an
anxious
face
upon
him
they
be
safe
enough
now
and
in
our
maybe
i
ought
to
have
let
them
go
she
returned
nervously
pooh
they
all
right
that
scalawag
to
by
this
time
is
he
william
he
tuck
up
the
fence
like
a
scared
rabbit
todd
responded
looking
into
his
hat
to
avoid
meeting
the
eyes
of
the
lady
i
did
have
no
call
to
toller
and
he
knowed
how
to
run
i
reckon
time
harkless
come
out
the
yard
again
he
was
near
out
o
sight
and
we
see
him
take
across
the
road
to
the
near
up
somebody
else
with
him
then
looked
like
a
kid
must
cut
acrost
the
field
to
join
him
they
fur
enough
towards
home
by
did
miss
helen
shake
hands
with
you
four
or
five
times
asked
briscoe
chuckling
no
why
because
harkless
did
my
hand
aches
and
i
guess
william
does
too
he
nearly
shook
our
arms
off
when
we
told
him
he
been
a
fool
seemed
to
do
him
good
i
told
him
he
ought
to
hire
somebody
to
take
a
shot
at
him
every
morning
before
breakfast
not
that
it
any
joking
matter
the
old
gentleman
finished
thoughtfully
i
should
say
not
said
william
with
a
deep
frown
and
a
jerk
of
his
head
toward
the
rear
of
the
house
jokes
about
it
enough
even
promise
to
carry
a
gun
after
this
said
he
would
know
how
to
use
it
never
shot
one
off
since
he
was
a
boy
on
the
fourth
of
july
this
is
the
third
time
he
shot
at
this
year
but
he
says
the
others
was
at
a
a
what
he
call
it
merely
complimentary
range
briscoe
supplied
he
handed
william
a
cigar
and
bit
the
end
off
another
himself
minnie
you
better
go
in
the
house
and
read
i
expect
unless
you
want
to
go
down
the
creek
and
join
those
she
responded
i
know
when
to
stay
away
i
guess
do
go
and
put
that
terrible
gun
no
said
briscoe
lighting
his
cigar
deliberately
it
all
safe
there
no
question
of
that
but
maybe
william
and
i
better
go
out
and
take
a
smoke
in
the
orchard
as
long
as
they
stay
down
at
the
in
the
garden
shafts
of
white
light
pierced
the
bordering
trees
and
fell
where
june
roses
lifted
their
heads
to
breathe
the
mild
night
breeze
and
here
through
summer
spells
the
editor
of
the
herald
and
the
lady
who
had
run
to
him
at
the
pasture
bars
strolled
down
a
path
trembling
with
shadows
to
where
the
shallow
creek
tinkled
over
the
pebbles
they
walked
slowly
with
an
air
of
being
friends
and
comrades
and
for
some
reason
it
did
not
strike
either
of
them
as
unnatural
or
extraordinary
they
came
to
a
bench
on
the
bank
and
he
made
a
great
fuss
dusting
the
seat
for
her
with
his
black
slouch
hat
then
he
regretted
the
hat
it
was
a
shabby
old
hat
of
a
carlow
county
fashion
it
was
a
long
bench
and
he
seated
himself
rather
remotely
toward
the
end
opposite
her
suddenly
realizing
that
he
had
walked
very
close
to
her
coming
down
the
narrow
garden
path
neither
knew
that
neither
had
spoken
since
they
left
the
veranda
and
it
had
taken
them
a
long
time
to
come
through
the
little
orchard
and
the
garden
she
rested
her
chin
on
her
hand
leaning
forward
and
looking
steadily
at
the
creek
her
laughter
had
quite
gone
her
attitude
seemed
a
little
wistful
and
a
little
sad
he
noted
that
her
hair
curled
over
her
brow
in
a
way
he
had
not
pictured
in
the
lady
of
his
dreams
this
was
so
much
lovelier
he
did
not
care
for
tall
girls
he
had
not
cared
for
them
for
almost
half
an
hour
it
was
so
much
more
beautiful
to
be
dainty
and
small
and
piquant
he
had
no
notion
that
he
was
sighing
in
a
way
that
would
have
put
a
furnace
to
shame
but
he
turned
his
eyes
from
her
because
he
feared
that
if
he
looked
longer
he
might
blurt
out
some
speech
about
her
beauty
his
glance
rested
on
the
bank
but
its
diameter
included
the
edge
of
her
white
skirt
and
the
tip
of
a
little
white
slipper
that
peeped
out
beneath
it
and
he
had
to
look
away
from
that
too
to
keep
from
telling
her
that
he
meant
to
advocate
a
law
compelling
all
women
to
wear
crisp
white
gowns
and
white
slippers
on
moonlight
nights
she
picked
a
long
spear
of
grass
from
the
turf
before
her
twisted
it
absently
in
her
fingers
then
turned
to
him
slowly
her
lips
parted
as
if
to
speak
then
she
turned
away
again
the
action
was
so
odd
and
somehow
as
she
did
it
so
adorable
and
the
preserved
silence
was
such
a
bond
between
them
that
for
his
life
he
could
not
have
helped
moving
up
the
bench
toward
her
what
is
it
he
asked
and
he
spoke
in
a
whisper
he
might
have
used
at
the
bedside
of
a
dying
friend
he
would
not
have
laughed
if
he
had
known
he
did
so
she
twisted
the
spear
of
grass
into
a
little
ball
and
threw
it
at
a
stone
in
the
water
before
she
answered
do
you
know
harkless
you
and
i
have
have
we
did
we
forget
to
be
presented
to
each
other
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
sherwood
in
the
perturbation
of
comedy
i
it
was
melodrama
was
it
she
said
he
laughed
but
she
shook
her
head
comedy
he
answered
except
your
part
of
it
which
you
should
have
done
it
was
not
arranged
in
honor
of
ladies
but
you
must
think
me
a
comedian
truly
i
did
plan
it
my
friend
from
must
be
given
the
credit
of
devising
the
you
divined
it
it
was
a
little
too
picturesque
i
think
i
know
about
please
tell
me
what
you
mean
to
nothing
what
should
i
you
mean
that
you
will
keep
on
letting
them
shoot
at
you
until
they
until
you
she
struck
the
bench
angrily
with
her
hand
there
no
summer
theatre
in
there
not
even
a
church
why
should
they
he
asked
gravely
during
the
long
and
tedious
evenings
it
cheers
the
poor
soul
to
drop
over
here
and
take
a
shot
at
me
it
whiles
away
dull
care
for
him
and
he
has
the
additional
exercise
of
running
all
the
way
ah
she
cried
indignantly
they
told
me
you
always
answered
like
this
well
you
see
the
efforts
have
proved
so
purely
hygienic
for
me
as
a
patriot
i
have
sometimes
felt
extreme
mortification
that
such
bad
marksmanship
should
exist
in
the
county
but
i
console
myself
with
the
thought
that
their
best
shots
are
unhappily
in
the
there
are
many
left
ca
you
understand
that
they
will
organize
again
and
come
in
a
body
as
they
did
before
you
broke
them
up
and
then
if
they
come
on
a
night
when
they
know
you
are
wandering
out
of
town
you
have
not
the
advantage
of
an
intimate
study
of
the
most
exclusive
people
of
the
miss
sherwood
there
are
about
twenty
gentlemen
who
remain
in
that
neighborhood
while
their
relatives
sojourn
under
discipline
if
you
had
the
entree
over
there
you
would
understand
that
these
twenty
could
not
gather
themselves
into
a
company
and
march
the
seven
miles
without
physical
debate
in
the
ranks
they
are
not
precisely
amiable
people
even
amongst
themselves
they
would
quarrel
and
shoot
each
other
to
pieces
long
before
they
got
but
they
worked
in
a
company
never
for
seven
miles
four
miles
was
their
radius
five
would
see
them
all
she
struck
the
bench
again
oh
you
laugh
at
me
you
make
a
joke
of
your
own
life
and
death
and
laugh
at
everything
have
five
years
of
plattville
taught
you
to
do
that
i
laugh
only
at
taking
the
poor
too
seriously
i
laugh
at
your
running
into
fire
to
help
a
i
knew
there
was
any
risk
i
knew
he
had
to
stop
to
load
before
he
shot
he
did
shoot
again
if
i
had
known
you
before
i
his
tone
changed
and
he
spoke
gravely
i
am
at
your
feet
in
worship
of
your
philanthropy
it
so
much
finer
to
risk
your
life
for
a
stranger
than
for
a
that
is
rather
a
man
point
of
view
is
it
you
risked
yours
for
a
man
you
had
never
seen
oh
no
i
saw
you
at
the
lecture
i
heard
you
introduce
the
honorable
then
i
do
understand
your
wishing
to
save
she
smiled
unwillingly
and
turned
her
gray
eyes
upon
him
with
troubled
sunniness
and
under
the
kindness
of
her
regard
he
set
a
watch
upon
his
lips
though
he
knew
it
might
not
avail
him
he
had
driveled
along
respectably
so
far
he
thought
but
he
had
the
sentimental
longings
of
years
starved
of
expression
culminating
in
his
heart
she
continued
to
look
at
him
wistfully
searchingly
gently
then
her
eyes
traveled
over
his
big
frame
from
his
shoes
a
patch
of
moonlight
fell
on
them
they
were
dusty
he
drew
them
under
the
bench
with
a
shudder
to
his
broad
shoulders
he
shook
the
stoop
out
of
them
she
stretched
her
small
hands
toward
him
in
contrast
and
broke
into
the
most
delicious
low
laughter
in
the
world
at
this
sound
he
knew
the
watch
on
his
lips
was
worthless
it
was
a
question
of
minutes
till
he
should
present
himself
to
her
eyes
as
a
sentimental
and
susceptible
imbecile
he
knew
it
he
was
in
wild
spirits
could
you
realize
that
one
of
your
dangers
might
be
a
shaking
she
cried
is
your
seriousness
a
lost
art
her
laughter
ceased
suddenly
ah
no
i
understand
thiers
said
the
french
laugh
always
in
order
not
to
weep
i
have
lived
here
five
years
i
should
laugh
too
if
i
were
look
at
the
moon
he
responded
we
plattvillains
own
that
with
the
best
of
metropolitans
and
for
my
part
i
see
more
of
it
here
you
do
not
appreciate
us
we
have
large
landscapes
in
the
heart
of
the
city
and
what
other
capital
possesses
advantages
like
that
next
winter
the
railway
station
is
to
have
a
new
stove
for
the
heaven
itself
is
one
of
our
suburbs
it
is
so
close
that
all
one
has
to
do
is
to
die
you
insist
upon
my
being
french
you
see
and
i
know
you
are
fond
of
nonsense
how
did
you
happen
to
put
walrus
and
the
carpenter
at
the
bottom
of
a
page
of
fisbee
notes
was
it
how
were
you
sure
it
was
i
in
carlow
county
he
might
have
written
it
fisbee
has
never
in
his
life
read
anything
lighter
than
cuneiform
miss
briscoe
she
does
read
lewis
carroll
and
it
was
not
her
hand
what
made
you
write
it
on
fisbee
manuscript
he
was
with
us
this
afternoon
and
i
teased
him
a
little
about
your
heading
and
the
cradle
the
altar
and
the
tomb
is
it
and
he
said
it
had
always
troubled
him
but
that
you
thought
it
good
so
do
i
he
asked
me
if
i
could
think
of
anything
that
you
might
like
better
to
put
in
place
of
it
and
i
wrote
time
has
come
because
it
was
the
only
thing
i
could
think
of
that
was
as
appropriate
and
as
fetching
as
your
headlines
he
was
perfectly
dear
about
it
he
was
so
serious
he
said
he
feared
it
would
be
acceptable
i
did
notice
that
the
paper
he
handed
me
to
write
on
was
part
of
his
notes
nor
did
he
i
think
afterward
he
put
it
back
in
his
pocket
it
was
a
i
not
so
sure
he
did
not
notice
he
is
very
wise
do
you
know
somehow
i
have
the
impression
that
the
old
fellow
wanted
me
to
meet
how
dear
and
good
of
him
she
spoke
earnestly
and
her
face
was
suffused
with
a
warm
light
there
was
no
doubt
about
her
meaning
what
she
said
it
was
john
answered
unsteadily
he
knew
how
great
was
my
need
of
a
few
moments
companionableness
with
with
no
she
interrupted
i
meant
dear
and
good
to
me
because
i
think
he
was
thinking
of
me
and
it
was
for
my
sake
he
wanted
us
to
it
would
have
been
hard
to
convince
a
woman
if
she
had
overheard
this
speech
that
miss
sherwood
humility
was
not
the
calculated
affectation
of
a
coquette
sometimes
a
man
unsuspicion
is
wiser
and
harkless
knew
that
she
was
not
flirting
with
him
in
addition
he
was
not
a
fatuous
man
he
did
not
extend
the
implication
of
her
words
nearly
so
far
as
she
would
have
had
him
but
i
had
met
you
said
he
long
what
she
cried
and
her
eyes
danced
you
actually
remember
yes
do
you
he
answered
i
stood
in
jones
field
and
heard
you
singing
and
i
remembered
it
was
a
long
time
since
i
had
heard
you
sing
was
a
ruffler
of
flanders
and
fought
for
a
florin
hire
you
were
the
dame
of
my
captain
and
sang
to
my
heart
desire
but
that
is
the
balladist
notion
the
truth
is
that
you
were
a
lady
at
the
court
of
clovis
and
i
was
a
heathen
captive
i
heard
you
sing
a
christian
hymn
and
asked
for
by
a
great
effort
he
managed
to
look
as
if
he
did
not
mean
it
but
she
did
not
seem
with
his
fancy
for
the
surprise
fading
from
her
face
oh
that
was
the
way
you
remembered
she
said
perhaps
it
was
not
that
way
alone
you
wo
despise
me
for
being
mawkish
he
asked
i
have
had
the
chance
for
so
the
night
air
wrapped
them
warmly
and
the
balm
of
the
little
breezes
that
stirred
the
foliage
around
them
was
the
smell
of
damask
roses
from
the
garden
the
creek
tinkled
over
the
pebbles
at
their
feet
and
a
drowsy
bird
by
the
moon
crooned
languorously
in
the
sycamores
the
girl
looked
out
at
the
flashing
water
through
downcast
lashes
is
it
because
it
is
so
transient
that
beauty
is
pathetic
she
said
because
we
can
never
come
back
to
it
in
quite
the
same
way
i
am
a
sentimental
girl
if
you
are
born
so
it
is
never
entirely
teased
out
of
you
is
it
besides
is
all
a
dream
it
is
real
you
know
you
could
be
her
tone
was
gentle
as
a
caress
and
it
made
him
tingle
to
his
how
do
you
know
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
i
just
know
do
you
think
i
very
and
forward
she
said
dreamily
it
was
your
song
i
wanted
to
be
sentimental
about
i
am
like
one
through
long
days
of
toil
only
that
does
quite
apply
nights
devoid
of
ease
but
i
ca
claim
that
one
does
sleep
well
here
it
is
plattville
specialty
like
one
who
heard
in
his
soul
the
music
of
wonderful
melodies
those
blessed
old
lines
she
said
once
a
thing
is
music
or
poetry
all
the
and
elocutionists
in
the
world
can
not
ruin
it
can
they
yes
to
live
here
out
of
the
world
giving
up
the
world
doing
good
and
working
for
others
working
for
a
community
as
you
do
i
am
not
quite
shameless
he
interrupted
smilingly
i
was
given
a
life
sentence
for
incompetency
and
i
served
five
years
of
it
which
have
been
made
much
happier
than
my
no
she
persisted
that
is
your
way
of
talking
of
yourself
i
know
you
would
always
yourself
down
if
one
paid
any
attention
to
it
but
to
give
up
the
world
to
drop
out
of
it
without
regret
to
come
here
and
do
what
you
have
done
and
to
live
the
life
that
must
be
so
desperately
dry
and
dull
for
a
man
of
your
sort
and
yet
to
have
the
kind
of
heart
that
makes
wonderful
melodies
sing
in
itself
oh
she
cried
i
say
that
is
fine
you
do
not
understand
he
returned
sadly
wishing
before
her
to
be
unmercifully
just
to
himself
i
came
here
because
i
could
make
a
living
anywhere
else
and
the
melodies
i
have
known
you
only
one
evening
and
the
melodies
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
took
a
few
steps
toward
the
garden
come
he
said
let
me
take
you
back
let
us
go
before
i
he
finished
with
a
helpless
laugh
she
stood
by
the
bench
one
hand
resting
on
it
she
stood
all
in
the
tremulant
shadow
she
moved
one
step
toward
him
and
a
single
long
sliver
of
light
pierced
the
sycamores
and
fell
upon
her
head
he
gasped
what
was
it
about
the
melodies
she
said
nothing
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
for
this
evening
that
you
have
given
me
i
i
suppose
you
are
leaving
no
one
ever
stays
i
what
about
the
melodies
he
gave
it
up
the
moon
makes
people
insane
he
cried
if
that
is
true
she
returned
then
you
need
not
be
more
afraid
than
i
because
is
plural
what
were
you
saying
about
i
heard
them
in
my
heart
when
i
heard
your
voice
i
knew
that
it
was
you
who
sang
them
there
had
been
singing
them
for
me
so
she
cried
gaily
all
that
debate
about
a
pretty
speech
then
sinking
before
him
in
a
deep
courtesy
i
am
beholden
to
you
she
said
do
you
think
that
no
man
ever
made
a
little
flattery
for
me
before
at
the
edge
of
the
orchard
where
they
could
keep
an
unseen
watch
on
the
garden
and
the
bank
of
the
creek
judge
briscoe
and
todd
were
ensconced
under
an
the
former
still
armed
with
his
when
the
two
young
people
got
up
from
their
bench
the
two
men
rose
hastily
and
then
sauntered
slowly
toward
them
when
they
met
harkless
shook
each
of
them
cordially
by
the
hand
without
seeming
to
know
it
we
were
coming
to
look
for
you
explained
the
judge
william
was
afraid
to
go
home
alone
thought
some
one
might
take
him
for
harkless
and
shoot
him
before
he
got
into
town
can
you
come
out
with
young
willetts
in
the
morning
harkless
he
went
on
and
go
with
the
ladies
to
see
the
parade
and
minnie
wants
you
to
stay
to
dinner
and
go
to
the
show
with
them
in
the
harkless
seized
his
hand
and
shook
it
fervently
and
then
laughed
heartily
as
he
accepted
the
invitation
at
the
gate
miss
sherwood
extended
her
hand
to
him
and
said
politely
and
with
some
flavor
of
mockery
harkless
i
do
not
leave
i
am
very
glad
to
have
met
we
are
going
to
keep
her
all
summer
if

said
minnie
weaving
her
arm
about
her
friend
waist

the
morning
miss
sherwood
he
returned
hilariously
it
has
been
such
a
pleasure
to
meet
you
thank
you
so
much
for
saving
my
life
it
was
very
good
of
you
indeed
yes
in
the
morning
he
shook
hands
with
them
all
again
including
todd
who
was
going
with
him
he
laughed
most
of
the
way
home
and
todd
walked
at
his
side
in
amazement
the
herald
building
was
a
decrepit
frame
structure
on
main
street
it
had
once
been
a
small
warehouse
and
was
now
sadly
in
need
of
paint
closely
adjoining
it
in
a
large
yard
stood
a
low
brick
cottage
over
which
the
second
story
of
the
warehouse
leaned
in
an
effect
of
tipsy
affection
that
had
reminded
harkless
when
he
first
saw
it
of
an
old
book
of
an
inebriated
parent
under
convoy
of
a
devoted
child
the
title
to
these
two
buildings
and
the
blank
yard
had
been
included
in
the
purchase
of
the
herald
and
the
cottage
was
harkless
home
there
was
a
light
burning
upstairs
in
the
herald
office
from
the
street
a
broad
stairway
ran
up
on
the
outside
of
the
building
to
the
second
floor
and
at
the
stairway
railing
john
turned
and
shook
his
companion
warmly
by
the
hand
william
he
said
it
was
plucky
of
you
to
join
in
that
muss
i
sha
forget
i
jest
happened
to
come
along
replied
the
other
drowsily
then
with
a
portentous
yawn
he
asked
ai
ye
goin
to
bed
no
parker
would
allow
well
observed
william
with
another
yawn
which
bade
fair
to
expose
the
veritable
soul
of
him
i
how
ye
stand
it
it
closte
on
eleven
john
went
up
the
steps
singing
aloud
for
we
merry
merry
be
for
we
merry
merry
be
and
stopped
on
the
sagging
platform
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
gave
the
moon
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
and
friendly
laughter
at
that
it
suddenly
struck
him
that
he
was
years
of
age
that
he
had
laughed
a
great
deal
that
evening
that
he
had
laughed
and
laughed
over
things
not
in
the
least
humorous
like
an
excited
schoolboy
making
his
first
formal
call
that
he
had
shaken
hands
with
miss
briscoe
when
he
left
her
as
if
he
should
never
see
her
again
that
he
had
taken
miss
sherwood
hand
twice
in
one
very
temporary
parting
that
he
had
shaken
the
judge
hand
five
times
and
william
four
idiot
he
cried
what
has
happened
to
me
then
he
shook
his
fist
at
the
moon
and
went
in
to
work
he
thought
chapter
vii
morning
some
in
rags
and
some
in
tags
and
some
in
velvet
gowns
the
bright
sun
of
shone
into
harkless
window
and
he
awoke
to
find
himself
smiling
for
a
little
while
he
lay
content
drowsily
wondering
why
he
smiled
only
knowing
that
there
was
something
new
it
was
thus
as
a
boy
he
had
wakened
on
his
birthday
mornings
or
on
christmas
or
on
the
fourth
of
july
drifting
happily
out
of
pleasant
dreams
into
the
consciousness
of
delights
that
had
come
true
yet
lying
only
in
a
cheerful
borderland
leaving
happiness
undefined
the
morning
breeze
was
fluttering
at
his
window
blind
a
honeysuckle
vine
tapped
lightly
on
the
pane
birds
were
trilling
warbling
whistling
from
the
street
came
the
rumbling
of
wagons
merry
cries
of
greeting
and
the
barking
of
dogs
what
was
it
made
him
feel
so
young
and
strong
and
the
breeze
brought
him
the
smell
of
june
roses
fresh
and
sweet
with
dew
and
then
he
knew
why
he
had
come
smiling
from
his
dreams
he
would
go
a
with
that
he
leaped
out
of
bed
and
shouted
loudly
zen
hello
xenophon
in
answer
an
ancient
very
black
darky
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
his
warped
and
wrinkled
visage
showing
under
his
grizzled
hair
like
charred
paper
in
a
fall
of
pine
ashes
he
said
suh
yessuh
done
pump
full
a
few
moments
later
the
colored
man
seated
on
the
front
steps
of
the
cottage
heard
a
mighty
splashing
within
while
the
rafters
rang
with
stentorian
song
he
promised
to
buy
me
a
bunch
o
blue
ribbon
he
promised
to

so
long
at
the
fair
at
the
sound
of
this
complaint
delivered
in
a
manly
voice
the
listener
jaw
dropped
and
his
mouth
opened
and
stayed
open
he
muttered
faintly
well
the
old
triangle
knew
the
music
of
our
tread
how
the
peaceful
seminole
would
tremble
in
his
bed
sang
the

him
suddenly
and

he
said
querulously
what

the
splashing
ceased
but
not
the
voice
which
struck
into
a
noble
marching
chorus

the
colored
man
i

tra

the
length
of
main
street
and
all
the
square
resounded
with
the
rattle
of
vehicles
of
every
kind
since
earliest
dawn
they
had
been
pouring
into
the
village
a
long
procession
on
every
country
road
there
were
great
red
and
blue
farm
wagons
drawn
by
splendid
clydesdales
the
elders
of
the
family
on
the
front
seat
and
on
boards
laid
from
side
to
side
in
front
or
on
chairs
placed
close
behind
while
in
the
deep
beds
back
of
these
children
tumbled
in
the
straw
or
peeped
over
the
sides
and
laughing
eyes
alight
with
blissful
anticipations
there
were
more
pretentious
and
stout
buckboards
loaded
down
with
merrymakers
four
on
a
seat
meant
for
two
there
were
phaetons
and
comfortable
drawn
by
steady
spans
and
now
and
then
mule
teams
bringing
happy
negroes
ready
to
squander
all
on
the
first
georgia
watermelons
and
cider
every
vehicle
contained
heaping
baskets
of
good
things
to
eat
the
previous
night
had
been
a
woeful
bartholomew
for
carlow
chickens
and
underneath
where
the
dogs
paced
faithfully
swung
buckets
and
fodder
for
the
horses
while
colts
innumerable
trotted
dose
to
the
maternal
flanks
viewing
the
world
with
their
big
new
eyes
in
frisky
surprise
here
and
there
the
trim
buggy
of
some
prosperous
son
escorting
his
sweetheart
flashed
along
the
road
the
young
mare
stepping
out
in
pride
of
blood
to
pass
the
line
of
wagons
the
youth
who
held
the
reins
resplendent
in
sunday
best
and
even
better
his
scorched
brown
face
glowing
with
a
fine
belief
in
the
superiority
of
both
his
steed
and
his
lady
the
latter
beaming
out
upon
life
and
rejoicing
in
the
ribbons
on
her
hat
the
ribbon
around
her
waist
the
silk
on
her
hands
and
the
beautiful
red
coral
necklace
about
her
neck
and
the
red
coral
buttons
that
fastened
her
gown
in
the
back
the
air
was
full
of
exhilaration
everybody
was
laughing
and
shouting
and
calling
greetings
for
carlow
county
was
turning
out
and
from
far
and
near
the
country
people
came
nay
from
over
the
county
line
clouds
of
dust
rising
from
every
thoroughfare
and
highway
and
sweeping
into
town
to
herald
their
coming
dibb
zane
the
sprinkling
contractor
had
been
at
work
with
the
town
since
the
morning
stars
were
bright
but
he
might
as
well
have
watered
the
streets
with
his
tears
which
indeed
when
the
farmers
began
to
come
in
bringing
their
cyclones
of
dust
he
drew
nigh
unto
after
a
spell
of
profanity
as
futile
as
his
cart
tief
wie
das
meer
soll
deine
liebe
sein
hummed
the
editor
in
the
cottage
his
song
had
taken
on
a
reflective
tone
as
that
of
one
who
cons
a
problem
or
musically
ponders
which
card
to
play
he
was
kneeling
before
an
old
trunk
in
his
bedchamber
from
one
compartment
he
took
a
neatly
folded
pair
of
duck
trousers
and
a
tweed
coat
from
another
a
straw
hat
with
a
ribbon
of
bright
colors
they
had
lain
in
the
trunk
a
long
time
undisturbed
and
he
examined
them
musingly
he
shook
the
coat
and
brushed
it
then
he
laid
the
garments
upon
his
bed
and
proceeded
to
shave
himself
carefully
after
which
he
donned
the
white
trousers
the
gray
coat
and
rummaging
in
the
trunk
again
found
a
gay
pink
cravat
which
he
fastened
about
his
tall
collar
also
a
resurrection
from
the
trunk
with
a
pearl
pin
after
that
he
had
a
long
solemn
time
arranging
his
hair
with
a
pair
of
brushes
when
at
last
he
was
suited
and
his
dressing
completed
he
sallied
forth
to
breakfast
xenophon
stared
after
him
as
he
went
out
of
the
gate
whistling
heartily
the
old
darky
lifted
his
hands
palms

exclaimed
aloud

along

the
passing
of
the
editor
in
his
cool
equipment
evoked
some
gasps
of
astonishment
and
tibbs
and
his
sister
rushed
from
the
postoffice
to
stare
after
him
he
looks
just
beautiful
solomon
said
miss
tibbs
but
what

a
game
the
catalogue
said
observed
miss
selina
was
it
it
was
a
mighty
pore
investment
the
postmaster
answered
as
harkless
approached
the
hotel
a
decrepit
old
man
in
a
vast
straw
hat
and
a
linen
duster
much
too
large
for
him
came
haltingly
forward
to
meet
him
he
was
wimby
husband
and
as
did
every
one
else
he
spoke
of
his
wife
by
the
name
of
her
former
martial
companion
fer
you
harkless
he
said
in
a
shaking
spindle
of
a
voice
as
plaintive
as
his
pale
little
eyes

roses

he

peaceable
enough
it
the
other
folks
you
got
to
look
out
he
limped
away
the
editor
waved
his
hand
to
him
from
the
door
but
the
old
fellow
shook
his
head
and
made
a
warning
friendly
gesture
with
his
arm
harkless
usually
ate
his
breakfast
alone
as
he
was
the
latest
riser
in
plattville
there
were
days
in
the
winter
when
he
did
not
reach
the
hotel
until
eight
this
morning
he
found
a
bunch
of
white
roses
still
wet
with
dew
and
so
fragrant
that
the
whole
room
was
fresh
and
sweet
with
their
odor
prettily
arranged
in
a
bowl
on
the
table
and
at
his
plate
the
largest
of
all
with
a
pin
through
the
stem
he
looked
up
smilingly
and
nodded
at
the
girl
thank
you
charmion
he
said
that
very
she
turned
even
redder
than
she
always
was
and
answered
nothing
vigorously
darting
her
brush
at
an
imaginary
fly
on
the
cloth
after
several
minutes
she
said
abruptly
you
there
was
a
silence
finally
broken
by
a
long
gasping
sigh
astonished
he
looked
at
the
girl
her
eyes
were
set
unfathomably
upon
his
pink
tie
the
wand
had
dropped
from
her
nerveless
hand
and
she
stood
rapt
and
immovable
she
started
violently
from
her
trance
ai
you
to
finish
your
coffee
she
asked
plying
her
instrument
again
and
bending
over
him
slightly
whispered
say
eph
watts
is
over
there
behind
at
a
table
in
a
far
corner
of
the
room
a
large
gentleman
in
a
brown
frock
coat
was
quietly
eating
his
breakfast
and
reading
the
he
was
of
an
ornate
presence
though
entirely
neat
a
sumptuous
expanse
of
linen
exhibited
itself
between
the
lapels
of
his
waistcoat
and
an
inch
of
bediamonded
breastpin
glittered
there
like
an
on
a
snowy
mountain
side
he
had
a
steady
blue
eye
and
a
dissipated
mustache
this
personage
was
ephraim
watts
who
following
a
calling
more
fashionable
in
the
eighteenth
century
than
in
the
latter
decades
of
the
nineteenth
had
shaken
the
dust
of
carlow
from
his
feet
some
three
years
previously
at
the
strong
request
of
the
authorities
the
herald
had
been
particularly
insistent
upon
his
deportation
and
in
the
local
phrase
harkless
had
run
him
out
of
perhaps
it
was
because
the
herald
opposition
as
the
editor
explained
at
the
time
had
been
merely
moral
and
impersonal
and
the
editor
had
always
confessed
to
a
liking
for
the
unprofessional
qualities
of
watts
that
there
was
but
slight
embarrassment
when
the
two
gentlemen
met
his
breakfast
finished
harkless
went
over
to
the
other
and
extended
his
hand
cynthia
held
her
breath
and
clutched
the
back
of
a
chair
however
watts
made
no
motion
toward
his
hip
pocket
instead
he
rose
flushed
slightly
and
accepted
the
hand
offered
him
i
glad
to
see
you
watts
said
the
journalist
cordially
also
if
you
are
running
with
the
circus
and
calculate
on
doing
business
here
i
have
to
see
that
you
are
fired
out
of
town
before
noon
how
are
you
you
looking
extremely
mr
harkless
answered
watts
i
cherish
no
hard
feelings
and
i
never
said
but
what
you
done
exactly
right
when
i
left
three
years
ago
no
sir
i
not
here
in
a
professional
way
at
all
and
i
do
want
to
be
molested
i
connected
myself
with
an
oil
company
and
i
down
here
to
look
over
the
ground
it
beats
poker
and
hollow
though
there
ai
as
many
chances
in
favor
of
the
dealer
and
in
oil
it
the
farmer
that
gets
the
i
come
back
but
in
an
enterprising
spirit
this
time
to
open
up
a
new
field
and
shed
light
and
money
in
carlow
they
told
me
never
to
show
my
face
here
again
but
if
you
say
i
stay
i
guess
i
stay
i
always
was
sure
there
was
oil
in
the
county
and
i
want
to
prove
it
for
everybody
benefit
is
it
all
right
my
dear
fellow
laughed
the
young

called
after
him
as
he
turned
away
he
nodded
in
reply
and
was
leaving
the
room
when
cynthia
detained
him
by
a
flourish
of
the
say
she
said

always

asked

displeased
i
very
sorry
wo
you
pin
it
on
my
coat
her
face
was
lifted
in
grateful
pleasure
and
she
began
to
pin
the
rose
to
his
lapel
her
hands
were
large
and
red
and
trembled
she
dropped
the
flower
and
saying
huskily
i
do
know
as
i
could
do
it
right
seized
violently
upon
a
pile
of
dishes
and
hurried
from
the
room
harkless
rescued
the
rose
pinned
it
on
his
coat
himself
and
observing
internally
for
the
hundredth
time
that
the
waitress
was
the
queerest
creature
in
the
village
set
forth
gaily
upon
his
holiday
when
he
reached
the
brick
house
on
the
pike
he
discovered
a
gentleman
sunk
in
an
easy
and
contemplative
attitude
in
a
big
chair
behind
the
veranda
railing
at
the
click
of
the
gate
the
lounger
rose
and
disclosed
the
stalwart
figure
and
brown
smiling
handsome
face
of
lige
willetts
an
habitual
devotee
of
minnie
briscoe
and
the
most
eligible
bachelor
of
carlow
the
ladies
will
be
down
right
off
he
said
greeting
the
editor
finery
with
a
perceptible
agitation
and
the
editor
himself
with
a
friendly
shake
of
the
hand
mildy
says
to
wait
out
but
immediately
there
was
a
faint
rustling
within
the
house
the
swish
of
draperies
on
the
stairs
a
delicious
whispering
when
light
feet
descend
tapping
to
hearts
that
beat
an
answer
the
telegraphic
message
we
come
we
come
we
are
near
we
are
near
lige
willetts
stared
at
harkless
he
had
never
thought
the
latter
until
he
saw
him
step
to
the
door
to
take
miss
sherwood
hand
and
say
in
a
strange
low
tense
voice
as
if
he
were
announcing
at
the
least
every
one
in
the
world
except
us
two
died
last
night
it
is
a
solemn
thing
but
i
am
very
they
walked
minnie
and
willetts
a
little
distance
in
front
of
the
others
harkless
could
not
have
told
afterward
whether
they
rode
or
walked
or
floated
on
an
to
the
all
he
knew
distinctly
was
that
a
divinity
in
a
pink
shirt
waist
and
a
hat
that
was
woven
of
gauzy
cloud
by
mocking
fairies
to
make
him
stoop
hideously
to
see
under
it
dwelt
for
the
time
on
earth
and
was
at
his
side
dazzling
him
in
the
morning
sunshine
last
night
the
moon
had
lent
her
a
silvery
glamour
she
had
something
of
the
ethereal
whiteness
of
in
that
watery
light
a
nymph
to
laugh
from
a
sparkling
fountain
at
the
moon
or
as
he
thought
remembering
her
courtesy
for
his
pretty
speech
perhaps
a
little
lady
of
king
louis
court
wandering
down
the
years
from
fontainebleau
and
appearing
to
clumsy
mortals
sometimes
of
a
june
night
when
the
moon
was
in
their
heads
but
she
was
of
the
clearest
color
a
pretty
girl
whose
gray
eyes
twinkled
to
his
in
gay
companionship
he
marked
how
the
sunshine
was
spun
into
the
fair
shadows
of
her
hair
and
seemed
itself
to
catch
a
lustre
rather
than
to
impart
it
and
the
light
of
the
june
day
drifted
through
the
gauzy
hat
touching
her
face
with
a
delicate
and
tender
flush
that
came
and
went
like
the
vibrating
pink
of
early
dawn
she
had
the
divinest
straight
nose
the
faintest
most
alluring
trifle
and
a
dimple
cleft
her
chin
the
deadliest
maelstrom
in
the
world
he
thrilled
through
and
through
he
had
been
only
vaguely
conscious
of
the
dimple
in
the
night
it
was
not
until
he
saw
her
by
daylight
that
he
really
knew
it
was
there
the
village
hummed
with
life
before
them
they
walked
through
shimmering
airs
sweeter
to
breathe
than
nectar
is
to
drink
she
caught
a
butterfly
basking
on
a
jimson
weed
and
before
she
let
it
go
held
it
out
to
him
in
her
hand
it
was
a
white
butterfly
he
asked
which
was
the
butterfly
bravo
she
said
tossing
the
captive
craft
above
their
heads
and
watching
the
small
sails
catch
the
breeze
and
so
you
can
make
little
flatteries
in
the
morning
too
it
is
another
courtesy
you
should
be
having
from
me
if
it
were
for
the
dustiness
of
it
wait
till
we
come
to
the
board
she
had
some
big
pink
roses
at
her
waist
in
the
meantime
he
answered
indicating
these
i
know
very
well
a
lad
that
would
be
blithe
to
accept
a
pretty
token
of
any
lady
high
but
you
have
one
already
a
very
beautiful
she
gave
him
a
genial
glance
from
head
to
foot
half
quizzical
but
so
quick
he
almost
missed
it
and
then
he
was
glad
he
had
found
the
straw
hat
with
the
youthful
ribbon
and
all
his
other
festal
vestures
and
a
very
becoming
flower
a
white
rose
is
she
continued
though
i
am
a
bold
girl
to
be
blarneying
with
a
young
gentleman
i
met
no
longer
ago
than
last
but
why
should
you
blarney
with
a
gentleman
when
you
began
by
saving
his
life
or
rather
when
the
gentleman
had
the
politeness
to
gallop
about
the
county
with
me
tucked
under
his
arm
she
stood
still
and
laughed
softly
but
consummately
and
her
eyes
closed
tight
with
the
mirth
of
it
she
had
taken
one
of
the
roses
from
her
waist
and
as
she
stood
holding
it
by
the
long
stem
its
petals
lightly
pressed
her
lips
you
may
have
it
in
exchange
she
said
he
bent
down
to
her
and
she
began
to
fasten
the
pink
rose
in
place
of
the
white
one
on
his
coat
she
did
not
ask
him
directly
or
indirectly
who
had
put
the
white
one
there
for
him
because
she
knew
by
the
way
it
was
pinned
that
he
had
done
it
himself
who
is
it
that
morning
brings
me
these
lovely
she
burlesqued
as
he
bent
over
her
wimby
he
returned
i
will
point
him
out
to
you
you
must
see
him
and
also
bodeffer
the
oldest
inhabitant
and
will
you
present
them
to
me
no
they
might
talk
to
you
and
take
some
of
my
time
with
you
away
from
her
eyes
sparkled
into
his
for
the
merest
fraction
of
a
second
and
she
laughed
half
mockingly
then
she
dropped
his
lapel
and
they
proceeded
she
did
not
put
the
white
rose
in
her
belt
but
carried
it
the
square
was
heaving
with
a
jostling
goodnatured
happy
and
constantly
increasing
crowd
that
overflowed
on
main
street
in
both
directions
and
the
good
nature
of
this
crowd
was
augmented
in
the
ratio
that
its
size
increased
the
streets
were
a
confusion
of
many
colors
and
eager
faces
filled
every
window
opening
on
main
street
or
the
square
since
nine
all
those
of
the
courthouse
had
been
occupied
and
here
most
of
the
damsels
congregated
to
enjoy
the
spectacle
of
the
parade
and
their
swains
attended
gallantly
posting
themselves
at
coignes
of
less
vantage
behind
the
ladies
some
of
the
faces
that
peeped
from
the
dark
old
windows
were
pretty
and
some
of
them
were
not
pretty
but
nearly
all
of
them
were
and
all
were
pleasant
to
see
because
of
the
good
cheer
they
showed
some
of
the
gallants
affected
the
airy
and
easy
entertaining
the
company
with
badinage
and
repartee
some
were
openly
bashful
now
and
then
one
of
the
latter
after
long
deliberation
constructed
a
laborious
compliment
for
his
inamorata
and
after
advancing
and
propounding
half
of
it
again
retired
into
himself
smit
with
a
blissful
palsy
nearly
all
of
them
conversed
in
tones
that
might
have
indicated
that
they
were
separated
from
each
other
by
an
acre
lot
or
two
here
and
there
along
the
sidewalk
below
a
father
worked
his
way
through
the
throng
a
cherub
on
one
arm
his
coat
borne
with
long
enough
on
the
other
followed
by
a
mother
with
the
other
children
hanging
to
her
skirts
and
tagging
exasperatingly
behind
holding
red
and
blue
toy
balloons
and
delectable
batons
of
peppermint
in
tightly
closed
sadly
sticky
fingers
a
thousand
cries
rent
the
air
the
strolling
mountebanks
and
gypsying
the
peanut
vendors
the
boys
with
fans
for
sale
the
candy
sellers
the
popcorn
peddlers
the
italian
with
the
toy
balloons
that
float
like
a
cluster
of
colored
bubbles
above
the
heads
of
the
crowd
and
the
balloons
that
wail
like
a
baby
the
man
shouting
in
the
shrill
voice
that
reaches
everywhere
and
endures
forever

the

polish

dimly

unalterably
hooked
by
the
arm
to
blushing
maidens
bought
recklessly
of

of

forced
their

to
the

stands
and
there
all
shyly
silently
sipped
the
ambrosia
everywhere
the
hawkers
dinned
and
everywhere
was
heard
the
plaintive
squawk
of

to

all
fer
a
down
the
middle
of
the
street
kept
open
between
the
waiting
crowd
ran
barefoot
boys
many
of
whom
had
not
slept
at
home
but
had
kept
vigil
in
the
night
mists
for
the
coming
of
the
show
and
having
seen
the
muffled
pageant
arrive
swathed
and
with
no
pomp
and
panoply
had
returned
to
town
rioting
through
jewelled
cobwebs
in
the
morning
fields
happy
in
the
pride
of
knowledge
of
what
went
on
behind
the
scenes
or
the
runaways
would
face
a
woodshed
reckoning
with
outraged
ancestry
but
now
they
caracoled
in
the
dust
with
no
thought
of
the
grim
deeds
to
be
done
upon
them
in
the
yard
and
so
sinning
in
the
very
eye
of
the
law
two
swarthy
gentlemen
were
operating
with
some
greasy
walnut
shells
and
a
pea
what
the
fanciful
or
unsophisticated
might
have
been
pleased
to
call
a
game
of
chance
and
the
most
intent
spectator
of
the
group
around
them
was
james
bardlock
the
town
marshal
he
was
simply
and
unofficially
and
earnestly
interested
thus
the
eye
of
justice
may
not
be
said
to
have
winked
upon
the
nefariousness
now
under
its
vision
it
gazed
with
strong
curiosity
an
itch
to
dabble
and
it
must
be
admitted
a
growing
hope
of
profit
the
game
was
so
direct
and
the
player
so
sure
several
countrymen
had
won
small
sums
and
one
a
charmingly
rustic
stranger
with
a
peculiar
accent
he
said
that
him
and
his
goil
should
now
have
a
smoot
old
time
off
his
winninks
though
the
lady
was
not
manifested
had
won
dollars
with
no
trouble
at
all
the
two
operators
seemed
depressed
declaring
the
luck
against
them
and
the
plattville
people
too
brilliant
at
the
game
it
was
wonderful
how
the
young
couples
worked
their
way
through
the
thickest
crowds
never
separating
even
at
the
lemonade
stands
they
drank
holding
the
glasses
in
their
outer
hands
such
are
the
sacrifices
demanded
by
etiquette
but
observing
the
gracious
outpouring
of
fortune
upon
the
rustic
with
the
rare
accent
a
youth
in
a
green
tie
disengaged
his
arm
for
the
first
time
in
two
hours
from
that
of
a
girl
upon
whose
finger
there
shone
a
ring
sumptuous
and
golden
and
conducting
her
to
a
corner
of
the
yard
bade
her
remain
there
until
he
returned
he
had
to
speak
to
hartly
bowlder
he
explained
then
he
plunged
and
excited
into
the
circle
about
the
shell
manipulators
and
offered
to
lay
a
wager

who

edged
slowly
out
of

circle
abashed
and
with
rapidly
whitening
cheeks
he
paused
for
a
moment
outside
slowly
realizing
that
all
his
money
had
gone
in
one
wild
blind
whirl
the
money
he
had
earned
so
hard
and
saved
so
hard
to
make
a
holiday
for
his
sweetheart
and
himself
he
stole
one
glance
around
the
building
to
where
a
patient
figure
waited
for
him
then
he
fled
down
a
side
alley
and
soon
was
out
upon
the
country
road
tramping
soddenly
homeward
through
the
dust
his
chin
sunk
in
his
breast
and
his
hands
clenched
tight
at
his
sides
now
and
then
he
stopped
and
bitterly
hurled
a
stone
at
a
piping
bird
on
a
fence
or
gay
bob
white
in
the
fields
at
noon
the
patient
figure
was
still
waiting
in
the
corner
of
the
yard
meekly
twisting
the
golden
ring
upon
her
finger
but
the
flushed
young
man
who
had
spoken
thickly
to
her
deserter
drew
an
envied
roll
of
bankbills
from
his
pocket
and
began
to
bet
with
tipsy
caution
while
the
circle
about
the
gamblers
watched
with
fervid
interest
especially
bardlock
town
marshal
from
far
up
main
street
came
the
cry
she
she
and
this
announcement
of
the
parade
proving
only
one
of
a
dozen
false
alarms
a
thousand
discussions
took
place
over
silver
timepieces
as
to
when
she
was
really
due
schofields
henry
was
much
appealed
to
as
an
arbiter
in
these
discussions
from
a
sense
of
his
having
a
good
deal
to
do
with
time
in
a
general
sort
of
way
and
thus
schofields
came
to
be
reminded
that
it
was
getting
on
toward
ten
whereas
in
the
excitement
of
festival
he
had
not
yet
struck
nine
this
rushing
forthwith
to
do
he
did
and
in
the
elation
of
the
moment
seven
or
eight
besides
miss
helen
sherwood
was
looking
down
on
the
mass
of
shifting
color
from
a
window
whither
many
an
eye
was
upturned
in
wonder
and
she
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
schofields
emerge
on
the
steps
beneath
her
when
the
bells
had
done
and
heard
the
cheers
led
by
martin
with
which
the
laughing
crowd
greeted
his
appearance
after
the
performance
of
his
feat
she
turned
beamingly
to
harkless
what
a
family
it
is
she
laughed
just
one
big
jolly
family
i
did
know
people
could
be
like
this
until
i
came
to
that
is
the
word
for
it
he
answered
resting
his
hand
on
the
casement
beside
her
i
used
to
think
it
was
desolate
but
that
was
long
he
leaned
from
the
window
to
look
down
in
his
dark
cheek
was
a
glow
carlow
folk
had
never
seen
there
and
somehow
he
seemed
less
thin
and
tired
indeed
he
did
not
seem
tired
at
all
by
far
the
contrary
and
he
carried
himself
upright
when
he
was
not
stooping
to
see
under
the
hat
though
not
as
if
he
thought
about
it
i
believe
they
are
the
best
people
i
know
he
went
on
perhaps
it
is
because
they
have
been
so
kind
to
me
but
they
are
kind
to
each
other
too
kind
good
people
i
know
she
said
nodding
a
flower
on
the
gauzy
hat
set
to
vibrating
in
a
tantalizing
way
i
know
there
are
fat
women
who
rock
and
rock
on
piazzas
by
the
sea
and
they
speak
of
country
people
as
the
classes
how
happy
this
big
family
is
in
not
knowing
it
is
the
lower
classes
we
have
read
nordau
down
here
said
john
old
tom
martin
favorite
work
is
descent
of
man
miss
tibbs
admires
tupper
and
and
some
of
us
possess
the
works
of
roe
and
why
not
yes
what
of
it
she
returned
since
you
escape
nordau
i
think
the
conversation
we
hear
from
the
other
windows
is
as
amusing
and
quite
as
loud
as
most
of
that
i
hear
in
rouen
during
the
winter
and
rouen
you
know
is
just
like
any
other
big
place
nowadays
though
i
suppose
there
are
philadelphians
for
instance
who
would
be
slow
to
believe
a
statement
like
oh
but
they
are
not
all
of
philadelphia
he
left
the
sentence
smilingly
and
yet
somebody
said
further
west
i
travel
the
more
convinced
i
am
the
wise
men
came
from
the
east
yes
he
answered
is
the
important
word
in
it
was
a
girl
from
southeast
cottonbridge
massachusetts
said
helen
who
heard
i
was
from
indiana
and
asked
me
if
i
did
hate
to
live
so
far
away
from
there
was
a
pause
while
she
leaned
out
of
the
window
with
her
face
aside
from
him
then
she
remarked
carelessly
i
met
her
at
winter
do
you
go
to
winter
harbor
he
asked
we
have
gone
there
every
summer
until
this
one
for
years
have
you
friends
who
go
there
i
had
once
there
was
a
classmate
of
mine
from
rouen
what
was
his
name
perhaps
i
know
she
stole
a
glance
at
him
his
face
had
fallen
into
sad
lines
and
he
looked
like
the
man
who
had
come
up
the
aisle
with
the
hon
kedge
halloway
a
few
moments
before
he
had
seemed
another
person
entirely
he
forgotten
me
i
dare
say
i
have
seen
him
for
seven
years
and
that
a
long
time
you
know
besides
he
in
the
world
where
remembering
is
harder
here
in
plattville
we
do
were
you
ever
at
winter
harbor
i
was
once
i
spent
a
very
happy
day
there
long
ago
when
you
must
have
been
a
little
girl
were
you
there
in
listen
she
cried
the
procession
is
coming
look
at
the
crowd
the
parade
had
seized
a
psychological
moment
there
was
a
fanfare
of
trumpets
in
the
east
lines
of
people
rushed
for
the
street
and
as
one
looked
down
on
the
straw
hats
and
sunbonnets
and
many
kinds
of
finer
head
apparel
tossing
forward
they
seemed
like
surf
sweeping
up
the
long
beaches
she
was
coming
at
last
the
boys
whooped
in
the
middle
of
the
street
some
tossed
their
arms
to
heaven
others
expressed
their
emotion
by
somersaults
those
most
deeply
moved
walked
on
their
hands
in
the
distance
one
saw
over
the
heads
of
the
multitude
tossing
banners
and
the
moving
crests
of
triumphal
cars
where
cohorts
were
shining
in
purple
and
she
coming
after
all
the
false
alarms
and
disappointments
she
was
coming
there
was
another
flourish
of
music
immediately
all
the
band
gave
sound
and
then
with
blare
of
brass
and
the
crash
of
drums
the
glory
of
the
parade
burst
upon
plattville
glory
in
the
utmost
the
resistless
impetus
of
the
music
the
flare
of
royal
banners
of
pennons
on
the
breeze
the
smiling
of
beautiful
court
ladies
and
great
silken
nobles
the
swaying
of
howdahs
on
camel
and
elephant
and
the
awesome
shaking
of
the
earth
beneath
the
elephant
feet
and
the
gleam
of
his
small
but
devastating
eye
every
one
declared
he
looked
the
alarmed
snoddy
full
in
the
face
as
he
passed
and
snoddy
felt
not
at
all
reassured
when
tom
martin
severely
hinted
that
it
was
with
the
threatening
glance
of
a
rival
then
the
badinage
of
the
clown
creaking
along
in
his
donkey
cart
the
terrific
recklessness
of
the
spangled
hero
who
was
drawn
by
in
a
cage
with
two
striped
tigers
the
spirit
of
the
prancing
steeds
that
drew
the
rumbling
chariots
and
the
grace
of
the
helmeted
charioteers
the
splendor
of
the
cars
and
the
magnificence
of
the
paintings
with
which
they
were
adorned
the
ecstasy
of
all
this
glittering
shining
gorgeous
pageantry
needed
even
more
than
walking
on
your
hands
to
express
last
of
all
came
the
tooting
calliope
followed
by
swarms
of
boys
as
it
executed
wait
till
the
clouds
roll
by
jennie
with
infinite
dash
and
gusto
when
it
was
gone
miss
sherwood
intent
gaze
relaxed
she
had
been
looking
on
as
eagerly
as
any
child
and
she
turned
to
speak
to
harkless
and
discovered
that
he
was
no
longer
in
the
room
instead
she
found
minnie
and
willetts
whom
he
had
summoned
from
another
window
he
was
called
away
explained
lige
he
thought
he
be
back
before
the
parade
was
over
and
said

it
so
much

inquiringly
minnie
laughed

a
farmer

bowlder

willetts
his
son
hartley
drinking
again

any

but
harkless

anything

tackle
a
sick
man
to
nurse
or
a
tipsy
one
to
handle
and
i
tell
you
willetts
went
on
with
enthusiasm
he
is
at
home
it
beats
me
and
lots
of
people
do
think
college

a
man
any
good
why
the
way
he
cured
old
fis
see
cried
minnie
loudly
pointing
out
of
the
window
look
down
there
something
there
was
a
swirl
in
the
crowd
below
men
were
running
around
a
corner
of
the
and
the
women
and
children
were
harking
after
they
went
so
fast
and
there
were
so
many
of
them
that
immediately
that
whole
portion
of
the
yard
became
a
pushing
tugging
pulling
squirming
jam
of
people
it
on
the
other
side
said
lige
we
can
see
from
the
hall
window
come
quick
before
these
other
folks
fill
it
they
followed
him
across
the
building
and
looked
down
on
an
agitated
swarm
of
faces
five
men
were
standing
on
the
entrance
steps
to
the
door
below
and
the
crowd
was
thickly
massed
beyond
leaving
a
little
semicircle
clear
about
the
steps
those
behind
struggled
to
get
closer
and
leaped
in
the
air
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
what
was
going
on
harkless
stood
alone
on
the
top
step
his
hand
resting
on
the
shoulder
of
the
pale
and
contrite
and
sobered
hartley
in
the
clear
space
jim
bardlock
was
standing
with
sheepishly
hanging
head
and
between
him
and
harkless
were
the
two
gamblers
of
the
walnut
shells
the
journalist
held
in
his
hand
the
implements
of
their
profession
give
it
all
up
he
was
saying
in
his
steady
voice
you
taken
dollars
from
this
boy
hand
it
the
men
began
to
edge
closer
to
the
crowd
giving
little
swift
desperate
searching
looks
from
left
to
right
and
right
to
left
moving
nervously
about
like
weasels
in
a
trap
close
up
there
tight
said
harkless
sharply
do
let
them
ca
we
git
no
square
treatment
here
one
of
the
gamblers
whined
but
his
eyes
blazing
with
rage
belied
the
plaintive
passivity
of
his
tone
we
been
running
no
skin
wy
d
say
we
gotter
give
up
our
own
money
you
gotter
prove
it
was
a
skin
we
risked
our
money
prove
it
come
up
here
eph
watts
friends
the
editor
turned
to
the
crowd
smiling
friends
here
a
man
we
ran
out
of
town
once
because
he
knew
too
much
about
things
of
this
sort
he
come
back
to
us
again
and
he
here
to
stay
he
give
us
an
on
the
shell
it
pretty
simple
remarked
watts
the
best
way
is
to
pick
up
the
ball
with
your
second
finger
and
the
back
part
of
your
thumb
as
you
pretend
to
lay
the
shell
down
over
it
this
he
illustrated
and
showed
several
methods
of
manipulation
with
professional
and
as
he
made
plain
the
easy
swindle
by
which
many
had
been
duped
that
morning
there
arose
an
angry
and
threatening
murmur
you
all
see
said
harkless
raising
his
voice
a
little
what
a
simple
cheat
it
is
and
old
as
pharaoh
yet
a
lot
of
you
stood
around
and
lost
your
own
money
and
stared
like
idiots
and
let
hartley
bowlder
lose
dollars
on
a
shell
racket
and
not
one
of
you
lifted
a
hand
how
hard
did
you
work
for
what
these
two
cheap
crooks
took
from
you
ah
he
cried
it
is
because
you
were
greedy
that
they
robbed
you
so
easily
you
know
it
true
it
when
you
want
to
get
something
for
nothing
that
the
men
steal
the
money
you
sweat
for
and
make
the
farmer
a
laughing
stock
and
jim
bardlock
town
marshal
you
who
confess
that
you
in
the
game
sixty
worth
yourself
his
eyes
were
lit
with
wrath
as
he
raised
his
accusing
hand
and
levelled
it
at
the
unhappy
municipal
the
town
marshal
smiled
uneasily
and
deprecatingly
about
him
and
meeting
only
angry
glances
hearing
only
words
of
condemnation
he
passed
his
hand
unsteadily
over
his
fat
mustache
shifted
from
one
leg
to
the
other
and
back
again
looked
up
looked
down
and
then
an
amiable
and
man
beholding
nothing
but
accusation
and
anger
in
heaven
and
earth
and
wishing
nothing
more
than
to
sink
into
the
waters
under
the
earth
but
having
no
way
of
reaching
them
finding
his
troubles
quite
unbearable
and
unable
to
meet
the
manifold
eye
of
man
he
sought
relief
after
the
unsagacious
fashion
of
a
larger
bird
than
he
his
burly
form
underwent
a
series
of
convulsions
not
unlike
sobs
and
he
shut
his
eyes
tightly
and
held
them
so
presenting
a
picture
of
misery
unequalled
in
the
memory
of
any
spectator
outstretched
hand
began
to
shake
you
he
tried
to
continue
you
a
man
elected
to
there
came
from
the
crowd
the
sound
of
a
sad
voice
drawling
that
a
nice
vest
jim
got
on
but
it
ai
hardly
the
feathers
fitten
for
an
ostrich
is
it
the
editor
gravity
gave
way
he
broke
into
a
ringing
laugh
and
turned
again
to
the
give
up
the
boy
money
step
down
here
and
git
it
said
the
one
who
had
spoken
there
was
a
turbulent
motion
in
the
crowd
and
a
cry
arose
run
out
ride
on
a
rail
tar
and
feathers
run
out
o
town
i
would
long
if
i
were
you
said
harkless
and
his
advice
seemed
good
to
the
a
roll
of
bills
which
he
counted
and
turned
over
to
the
elder
bowlder
was
sullenly
placed
in
his
hand
the
fellow
who
had
not
yet
spoken
clutched
the
journalist
sleeve
with
his
dirty
hand
we
hai
done
wit
youse
he
said
hoarsely
do
belief
it
not
fer
a
minute
see
the
town
marshal
opened
his
eyes
briskly
and
placing
a
hand
on
each
of
the
gamblers
said
i
hereby
do
arrest
your
said
persons
and
declare
you
my
the
cry
rose
again
louder
run
out
string
up
hang
them
hang
them
and
a
forward
rush
was
made
this
way
jim
be
quick
said
harkless
quietly
bending
down
and
jerking
one
of
the
gamblers
up
the
steps
get
through
the
hall
to
the
other
side
and
then
run
them
to
the
no
one
will
stop
you
that
way
watts
and
i
will
hold
this
bardlock
hustled
his
prisoners
through
the
doorway
and
the
crowd
pushed
up
the
steps
while
harkless
struggled
to
keep
the
vestibule
clear
until
watts
got
the
double
doors
closed
stand
back
here
he
cried
it
all
over
be
foolish
the
law
is
good
enough
for
us
stand
back
will
you
he
was
laughing
a
little
shoving
them
back
with
open
hand
and
elbow
when
a
small
compact
group
of
men
suddenly
dashed
up
the
steps
together
and
a
heavy
stick
swung
out
over
their
heads
a
straw
hat
with
a
gay
ribbon
sailed
through
the
air
the
journalist
long
arms
went
out
swiftly
from
his
body
in
several
directions
the
hands
not
open
but
clenched
and
hard
the
next
instant
he
and
watts
stood
alone
on
the
steps
and
a
man
with
a
bleeding
blaspheming
mouth
dropped
his
stick
and
tried
to
lose
himself
in
the
crowd
watts
was
returning
something
he
had
not
used
to
his
prophets
of
israel
exclaimed
william
todd
ruefully
it
was
eph
watts
pistol
did
you
see
harkless
i
was
up
on
them
steps
when
he
begun
i
do
believe
he
needs
as
much
takin
care
of
as
we
was
it
one
of
them
devils
that
knocked
his
hat
off
asked
judd
bennett
i
thought
i
see
bob
skillett
run
up
with
a
harkless
threw
open
the
doors
behind
him
the
hall
was
empty
you
may
come
in
now
he
said
this
is
my
chapter
viii
glad
afternoon
the
girl
by
the
blue
they
walked
slowly
back
along
the
pike
toward
the
brick
house
the
fennel
reached
up
its
dusty
yellow
heads
to
touch
her
skirts
as
she
passed
and
then
drooped
satisfied
against
the
purple
at
the
roadside
in
the
noonday
silence
no
cricket
chirped
nor
locust
raised
its
lorn
monotone
the
tree
shadows
mottled
the
road
with
blue
and
the
level
fields
seemed
to
pant
out
a
dazzling
breath
the
transparent
that
danced
above
the
low
corn
and
green
wheat
he
was
stooping
very
much
as
they
walked
he
wanted
to
be
told
that
he
could
look
at
her
for
a
thousand
years
her
face
was
rarely
and
exquisitely
modelled
but
perhaps
just
now
the
salient
characteristic
of
her
beauty
for
the
salient
characteristic
seemed
to
be
a
different
thing
at
different
times
was
the
coloring
a
delicate
glow
under
the
white
skin
that
bewitched
him
in
its
seeming
a
reflection
of
the
rich
benediction
of
the
noonday
sun
that
blazed
overhead
once
he
had
thought
the
way
to
the
briscoe
homestead
rather
a
long
walk
but
now
the
distance
sped
malignantly
and
strolled
they
never
so
slow
it
was
less
than
a
young
bird
flutter
from
a
with
her
acquiescence
he
rolled
a
cigarette
and
she
began
to
hum
lightly
the
air
of
a
song
a
song
of
an
ineffably
gentle
slow
movement
that
and
a
reference
of
the
morning
and
perhaps
the
smell
of
his
tobacco
mingling
with
the
fragrance
of
her
roses
awoke
again
the
keen
reminiscence
of
the
previous
night
within
him
clearly
outlined
before
him
rose
the
high
green
slopes
and
cool
of
the
coast
of
maine
while
his
old
self
lazily
watched
the
sharp
little
waves
through
lids
the
pale
smoke
of
his
cigarette
blowing
out
under
the
rail
of
a
waxen
deck
where
he
lay
cushioned
and
again
a
woman
pelted
his
face
with
handfuls
of
and
cried
up
lad
and
at
yonder
is
winter
again
he
sat
in
the
casino
breathless
with
pleasure
and
heard
a
young
girl
sing
the
serenade
a
young
girl
who
looked
so
bravely
unconscious
of
the
big
hushed
crowd
that
listened
looked
so
pure
and
bright
and
gentle
and
good
that
he
had
spoken
of
her
as
sir
galahad
little
he
recollected
he
had
been
much
taken
with
this
child
but
he
had
not
thought
of
her
from
that
time
to
this
he
supposed
had
almost
forgotten
her
no
her
face
suddenly
stood
out
to
his
view
as
though
he
saw
her
with
his
physical
eye
a
sweet
and
vivacious
child
face
with
hair
and
gray
eyes
and
a
short
upper
lip
and
the
voice
he
stopped
short
and
struck
his
palms
together
you
are
tom
little
cousin
the
great
harkless
she
answered
and
stretched
out
her
hand
to
him
i
remember
you
is
it
time
ah
but
i
never
forgot
you
he
cried
i
thought
i
had
i
did
know
who
it
was
i
was
remembering
i
thought
it
was
fancy
and
it
was
memory
i
never
forgot
your
voice
singing
and
i
remembered
your
face
too
though
i
thought
i
he
drew
a
deep
breath
was
why
tom
meredith
has
not
forgotten
you
she
said
as
he
paused
would
you
mind
shaking
hands
once
more
he
asked
she
gave
him
her
hand
again
with
all
my
heart
why
i
making
a
record
at
it
thank
they
called
me
galahad
little
sister
all
one
summer
because
the
great
john
harkless
called
me
that
you
danced
with
me
in
the
did
i
ah
she
said
shaking
her
head
you
were
too
busy
being
in
love
with
van
skuyt
to
remember
a
waltz
with
only
me
i
was
allowed
to
meet
you
as
a
reward
for
singing
my
very
best
and
you
you
bowed
with
the
indulgence
of
a
grandfather
and
asked
me
to
like
a
grandfather
how
young
i
was
then
how
time
changes
us
i
afraid
my
conversation
did
not
make
a
great
impression
upon
you
she
continued
but
it
did
i
am
remembering
very
fast
if
you
will
wait
a
moment
i
will
tell
you
some
of
the
things
you
the
girl
laughed
merrily
whenever
she
laughed
he
realized
that
it
was
becoming
terribly
difficult
not
to
tell
her
how
adorable
she
was
i
would
risk
it
if
i
were
you
she
warned
him
because
i
speak
to
you
at
all
i
shut
my
lips
tight
and
trembled
all
over
every
bit
of
the
time
i
was
dancing
with
you
i
did
not
sleep
that
night
because
i
was
so
unhappy
wondering
what
the
great
harkless
would
think
of
me
i
knew
he
thought
me
unutterably
stupid
because
i
talk
to
him
i
wanted
to
send
him
word
that
i
knew
i
had
bored
him
i
could
bear
for
him
not
to
know
that
i
knew
i
had
but
he
was
not
thinking
of
me
in
any
way
he
had
gone
to
sea
again
in
a
big
boat
the
ungrateful
pirate
cruising
with
van
how
time
change
us
said
john
you
are
wrong
though
i
did
think
of
you
i
have
al
yes
she
interrupted
tossing
her
head
in
airy
travesty
of
the
stage
coquette
you
think
so
i
mean
you
say
so
now
away
with
you
and
your
blarneying
and
so
they
went
through
the
warm
noontide
and
little
he
cared
for
the
heat
that
wilted
the
fat
mullein
leaves
and
made
the
barefoot
boy
who
passed
by
skip
gingerly
through
the
burning
dust
with
anguished
mouth
and
watery
eye
little
he
knew
of
the
locust
that
suddenly
whirred
his
mills
of
shrillness
in
the
and
sounded
so
hot
hot
hot
or
those
others
that
railed
at
the
country
quiet
from
the
dim
shade
around
the
brick
house
or
even
the
that
sat
on
the
fence
and
swore
to
them
in
the
face
of
a
sunny
sky
that
they
should
see
rain
ere
the
day
were
done
little
the
young
man
recked
of
what
he
ate
at
judge
briscoe
good
noon
dinner
chicken
wing
and
young
hot
rolls
as
light
as
the
fluff
of
a
summer
cloudlet
and
honey
and
milk
and
flavored
like
spices
of
arabia
and
fragrant
flaky
and
cool
rich
yellow
cream
lige
willetts
was
a
lover
yet
he
said
he
asked
no
better
than
to
just
go
on
eating
that
till
a
sweet
death
overtook
him
but
railroad
sandwiches
and
restaurant
chops
might
have
been
set
before
harkless
for
all
the
difference
it
would
have
made
to
him
at
no
other
time
is
a
man
feeling
of
companionship
with
a
woman
so
strong
as
when
he
sits
at
table
with
at
a
decorated
and
becatered
and
bewaitered
table
but
at
a
homely
appetizing
wholesome
home
table
like
old
judge
briscoe
the
very
essence
of
the
thing
is
domesticity
and
the
implication
is
utter
confidence
and
liking
there
are
few
greater
dangers
for
a
bachelor
an
insinuating
imp
perches
on
his
shoulder
and
softly
tickling
the
bachelor
ear
with
the
feathers
of
an
whispers
pretty
nice
is
it
eh
rather
pleasant
to
have
that
girl
sitting
there
do
you
think
enjoy
having
her
notice
your
was
empty
think
it
exhilarating
to
hand
her
those
rolls
looks
nice
does
she
says
you
rather
prettily
makes
your
lonely
breakfast
seem
mighty
dull
does
it
how
would
you
like
to
have
her
pour
your
coffee
for
you
my
boy
how
would
it
seem
to
have
such
pleasant
company
all
the
rest
of
your
life
pretty
cheerful
eh
when
miss
sherwood
passed
the
editor
the
the
casual
way
she
did
it
entranced
him
in
a
strange
exquisite
wonderment
he
did
not
set
the
dish
down
when
she
put
it
in
his
hand
but
held
it
straight
out
before
him
just
looking
at
it
until
willetts
had
a
dangerous
choking
fit
for
which
minnie
was
very
proud
of
lige
no
one
could
have
suspected
that
it
was
the
veil
of
laughter
when
helen
told
john
he
really
must
squeeze
a
lemon
into
his
iced
tea
he
felt
that
his
one
need
in
life
was
to
catch
her
up
in
his
arms
and
run
away
with
her
not
anywhere
in
particular
but
just
run
and
run
and
run
away
after
dinner
they
went
out
to
the
veranda
and
the
gentlemen
smoked
the
judge
set
his
chair
down
on
the
ground
tilted
back
in
it
with
his
feet
on
the
steps
and
blew
a
wavery
domed
city
up
in
the
air
he
called
it
solid
comfort
he
liked
to
sit
out
from
under
the
porch
roof
he
said
he
wanted
to
see
more
of
the
sky
the
others
moved
their
chairs
down
to
join
him
in
the
celestial
vision
there
had
blown
across
the
heaven
a
feathery
thin
cloud
or
two
but
save
for
these
there
was
nothing
but
glorious
and
tender
brilliant
blue
it
seemed
so
clear
and
close
one
marvelled
the
little
church
spire
in
the
distance
did
not
pierce
it
yet
at
the
same
time
the
eye
ascended
miles
and
miles
into
warm
shimmering
ether
far
away
two
buzzards
swung
slowly
at
anchor
to
the
sun
bright
translucent
cerulean
hue
let
my
wide
wings
drift
on
in
you
said
harkless
pointing
them
out
to
helen
you
seem
to
get
a
good
deal
of
fun
out
of
this
kind
of
weather
observed
lige
as
he
wiped
his
brow
and
shifted
his
chair
out
of
the
sun
i
expect
you
do
get
such
skies
as
this
up
in
rouen
said
the
judge
looking
at
the
girl
from
between
eyelids
it
the
same
indiana
sky
i
think
she
answered
i
guess
maybe
in
the
city
you
do
see
as
much
of
it
or
think
as
much
about
it
yes
they
the
indiana
skies
the
old
man
went
on
skies
as
blue
as
the
eyes
of
children
when
they
smile
at
you
there
are
any
others
anywhere
that
ever
seemed
much
like
them
to
me
they
been
company
for
me
all
my
life
i
do
think
there
are
any
others
half
as
beautiful
and
i
know
there
are
any
as
sociable
they
were
always
he
sighed
gently
and
miss
sherwood
fancied
his
wife
must
have
found
the
indiana
skies
as
lovely
as
he
had
in
the
days
of
long
ago
seems
to
me
they
the
softest
and
bluest
and
kindest
in
the
i
think
they
are
said
helen
and
they
are
more
beautiful
than
the
skies
though
i
doubt
if
many
of
us
hoosiers
realize
it
and
certainly
no
one
else
the
old
man
leaned
over
and
patted
her
hand
harkless
gasped
hoosiers
chuckled
the
judge
you
a
great
hoosier
young
lady
how
much
of
your
life
have
you
spent
in
the
state
hoosiers
but
i
going
to
be
a
good
one
she
answered
gaily
and
if
i
good
enough
when
i
grow
up
maybe
i
be
a
great
the
buckboard
had
been
brought
around
and
the
four
young
people
climbed
in
harkless
driving
before
they
started
the
judge
standing
on
the
in
front
of
the
gate
leaned
over
and
patted
miss
hand
again
harkless
gathered
up
the
reins
you
make
a
great
hoosier
all
right
said
the
old
man
beaming
upon
the
girl
you
need
worry
about
that
i
guess
my
when
he
said
my
dear
harkless
spoke
to
the
horses
wait
said
the
judge
still
holding
the
girl
hand
you
make
a
great
hoosier
some
day
do
fret
you
already
a
very
beautiful
then
he
bent
his
white
head
and
kissed
her
gallantly
john
said
good
afternoon
judge
the
whip
cracked
like
a
and
the
buckboard
dashed
off
in
a
cloud
of
dust
every
once
in
a
while
harkless
the
old
fellow
called
after
them
you
must
remember
to
look
at
the
the
enormous
white
tent
was
filled
with
a
hazy
yellow
light
the
warm
dusty
mellow
light
that
thrills
the
rejoicing
heart
because
it
is
found
nowhere
in
the
world
except
in
the
tents
of
a
circus
the
sunshine
and
sawdust
atmosphere
of
show
day
through
the
entrance
the
crowd
poured
steadily
coming
from
the
absorptions
of
the
tent
to
feast
upon
greater
wonders
passing
around
the
sawdust
ellipse
that
contained
two
rings
to
find
seats
whence
they
might
behold
the
splendors
so
soon
to
be
unfolded
every
one
who
was
not
buying
the
eternal
lemonade
was
eating
something
and
the
faces
of
children
shone
with
gourmand
rapture
indeed
very
often
the
eyes
of
them
were
all
you
saw
in
over
a
huge
apple
or
a
bulky
oblong
of
popcorn
partly
unwrapped
from
its
blue
cover
or
else
it
might
be
a
luscious
pink
crescent
of
watermelon
that
left
its
ravisher
stained
and
dripping
to
the
brow
here
as
in
the
morning
the
hawkers
raised
their
cries
in
unintermittent
shrillness
offering
to
the
musically
inclined
the
happy
evenings
alleged
to
contain
those
treasures
all
the
latest
songs
of
the
day
or
presented
for
the
consideration
of
the
humorous
the
lawrence
lapearl
setting
forth
in
full
the
art
of
comical
entertainment
and
repartee
schofields
henry
bought
two
of
these
no
doubt
on
the
principle
that
two
were
twice
as
instructive
as
one
intending
to
bury
himself
in
study
and
do
battle
with
tom
martin
on
his
own
ground
here
swayed
the
myriad
fans
here
paraded
blushing
youth
and
rosy
maiden
more
relentlessly
than
ever
here
crept
the
octogenarian
bodeffer
shaking
on
cane
and
the
shoulder
of
posterity
here
waddled
snoddy
who
had
hurried
through
the
animal
tent
for
fear
of
meeting
the
elephant
here
marched
sturdy
yeomen
and
stout
wives
here
came
william
todd
and
his
anna
belle
the
good
william
hushed
with
the
embarrassments
of
love
but
looking
out
warily
with
the
white
of
his
eye
for
martin
and
determined
not
to
sit
within
a
hundred
yards
of
him
here
rolled
in
the
orbit
of
habit
the
bacchanal
wilkerson
who
politely
answered
in
kind
all
the
uncouth
roarings
and
guttural
ejaculations
of
jungle
and
fen
that
came
from
the
animal
tent
in
brief
here
came
with
lightest
hearts
the
population
of
carlow
and
part
of
amo
helen
had
found
a
true
word
it
was
a
big
family
jim
bardlock
broadly
smiling
and
rejuvenated
shorn
of
depression
paused
in
front
of
the
reserve
seats
with
bardlock
on
his
arm
and
called
loudly
to
a
gentleman
on
a
tier
about
the
level
of
jim
head
how
are
ye
i
reckon
we
were
a
too
smart
fer
this
morning
huh
five
or
six
hundred
people
every
one
within
hearing
fumed
to
look
at
jim
but
the
gentleman
addressed
was
engaged
in
conversation
with
a
lady
and
did
not
notice
hi
hi
there
harkless
bellowed
jim
informally
the
people
turned
to
look
at
harkless
his
attention
was
arrested
and
his
cheek
grew
red
is
he
asked
a
little
confused
and
a
good
deal
annoyed
i
do
hear
what
ye
say
shouted
jim
putting
his
hand
to
his
ear
is
repeated
the
young
man
i
kill
that
fellow
he
added
to
lige
willetts
some
one
ought
to
have
done
it
long
what
i
what
is
it
i
only
wanted
to
say
me
and
you
certainly
did
fool
these
here
hoosiers
this
morning
huh
hustled
them
two
fellers
through
the
and
nobody
never
thought
to
slip
round
to
the
other
door
and
head
us
off
ha
ha
we
were
jest
a
too
many
fer
huh
from
an
upper
tier
of
seats
the
rusty
length
of
martin
erected
itself
joint
by
joint
like
an
extension
ladder
and
he
peered
down
over
the
gaping
faces
at
the
town
marshal
excuse
me
he
said
sadly
to
those
behind
him
but
his
dry
voice
penetrated
everywhere
i
got
up
to
hear
jim
say
bardlock
joined
in
the
laugh
against
himself
and
proceeded
with
his
wife
to
some
seats
forty
or
fifty
feet
distant
when
he
had
settled
himself
comfortably
he
shouted
over
cheerfully
to
the
unhappy
editor
them
got
it
in
fer
you
ai
that
fool
shet
up
snarled
the
aged
bodeffer
indignantly
he
was
sitting
near
the
young
couple
and
the
expression
of
his
sympathy
was
distinctly
audible
to
them
and
many
others
got
no
more
regards
than
a
brazing
a
feller
with
his
sweetheart
the
both
of
says
they
goin
to
do
fer
you
bleated
bardlock
swear
they
git
their
evens
with
martin
rose
again
do
git
scared
and
leave
town
harkless
he
called
out
jim
protect
vastly
to
the
young
man
relief
the
band
began
to
play
and
the
equestrians
and
equestriennes
capered
out
from
the
for
the
grand
entrance
and
the
performance
commenced
through
the
long
summer
afternoon
it
went
on
wonders
of
horsemanship
and
horsewomanship
exploits
on
wires
tight
and
slack
giddy
tricks
on
the
high
trapeze
feats
of
leaping
and
tumbling
in
the
rings
while
the
tireless
musicians
blatted
inspiringly
through
it
all
only
pausing
long
enough
to
allow
that
uproarious
jester
the
clown
to
ask
the
what
he
would
do
if
a
young
lady
came
up
and
kissed
him
on
the
street
and
to
exploit
his
hilarities
during
the
short
intervals
of
rest
for
the
athletes
when
it
was
over
john
and
helen
found
themselves
in
the
midst
of
a
densely
packed
crowd
and
separated
from
miss
briscoe
and
lige
people
were
pushing
and
shoving
and
he
saw
her
face
grow
pale
he
realized
with
a
pang
of
sympathy
how
helpless
he
would
feel
if
he
were
as
small
as
she
and
at
his
utmost
height
could
only
see
big
suffocating
backs
and
huge
shoulders
pressing
down
from
above
he
was
keeping
them
from
crowding
heavily
upon
her
with
all
his
strength
and
a
royal
feeling
of
protectiveness
came
over
him
she
was
so
little
and
yet
without
the
remotest
hint
of
hardness
she
gave
him
such
a
distinct
impression
of
poise
and
equilibrium
she
seemed
so
able
to
meet
anything
that
might
come
to
understand
it
even
to
laugh
at
it
so
americanly
capable
and
sure
of
the
event
that
in
spite
of
her
pale
cheek
he
could
not
feel
quite
so
protective
as
he
wished
to
feel
he
managed
to
get
her
to
one
of
the
and
placed
her
with
her
back
to
it
then
he
set
one
of
his
own
hands
against
it
over
her
head
braced
himself
and
stood
keeping
a
little
space
about
her
ruggedly
letting
the
crowd
surge
against
him
as
it
would
no
one
should
touch
her
in
rough
carelessness
thank
you
it
was
rather
trying
in
there
she
said
and
looked
up
into
his
eyes
with
a
divine
gratitude
please
do
do
that
he
answered
in
a
low
voice
do
what
look
like
she
not
only
looked
like
that
but
more
so
young
man
young
man
she
said
i
fear
you
wishful
of
turning
a
girl
the
throng
was
thick
around
them
garrulous
and
noisy
but
they
two
were
more
richly
alone
together
to
his
appreciation
than
if
they
stood
on
some
far
satellite
of
mars
he
was
not
to
forget
that
moment
and
he
kept
the
picture
of
her
as
she
leaned
against
the
big
blue
there
in
his
heart
the
clear
gray
eyes
lifted
to
his
the
delicate
face
with
the
color
stealing
back
to
her
cheeks
and
the
brave
little
figure
that
had
run
so
straight
to
him
out
of
the
night
shadows
there
was
something
about
her
and
in
the
moment
that
suddenly
touched
him
with
a
saddening
sweetness
too
keen
to
be
borne
the
finger
of
the
flying
hour
that
could
not
come
again
was
laid
on
his
soul
and
he
felt
the
tears
start
from
his
heart
on
their
journey
to
his
eyes
he
knew
that
he
should
always
remember
that
moment
she
knew
it
too
she
put
her
hand
to
her
cheek
and
turned
away
from
him
a
little
tremulously
both
were
silent
they
had
been
together
since
early
morning
plattville
was
proud
of
him
many
a
friendly
glance
from
the
folk
who
jostled
about
them
favored
his
suit
and
wished
both
of
them
well
and
many
lips
opening
to
speak
to
harkless
in
passing
closed
when
their
owners
more
tactful
than
bardlock
looked
a
second
time
old
tom
martin
still
perched
alone
on
his
high
seat
saw
them
standing
by
the
and
watched
them
from
under
his
rusty
hat
brim
i
reckon
it
three
or
four
thousand
years
since
i
was
young
he
sighed
to
himself
then
pushing
his
hat
still
further
down
over
his
eyes
i
do
believe
i
ort
to
rightly
look
on
at
he
sighed
again
as
he
rose
and
gently
spoke
the
name
of
his
dead
wife
marjie
it
lonesome
sometimes
i
reckon
you
mighty
tired
waitin
for
me
ever
since
yet
maybe
not
ulysses
over
on
your
side
now
and
perhaps
you
got
acquainted
with
him
you
always
thought
a
good
deal
more
of
him
than
you
did
of
do
you
see
that
tall
old
man
up
there
said
helen
nodding
her
head
toward
martin
i
think
i
should
like
to
know
him
i
sure
i
like
that
is
old
tom
i
i
was
sorry
and
ashamed
about
all
that
conspicuousness
and
shouting
it
must
have
been
very
unpleasant
for
you
it
must
have
been
so
for
a
stranger
please
try
to
forgive
me
for
letting
you
in
for
but
i
liked
it
it
was
in
the
family
and
it
was
so
jolly
and
and
that
dear
old
man
was
so
bright
do
you
know
she
said
softly
i
do
think
i
such
a
stranger
i
i
think
i
love
all
these
people
a
great
deal
in
spite
of
having
known
them
only
two
at
that
a
wild
exhilaration
possessed
him
he
wanted
to
shake
hands
with
everybody
in
the
tent
to
tell
them
all
that
he
loved
them
with
his
whole
heart
but
what
was
vastly
more
important
loved
them
a
great
deal
in
spite
of
having
known
them
only
two
days
he
made
the
horses
prance
on
the
homeward
drive
and
once
when
she
told
him
that
she
had
read
a
good
many
of
his
political
columns
in
the
herald
he
ran
them
into
a
fence
after
this
it
occurred
to
him
that
they
were
nearing
their
destination
and
had
come
at
a
perversely
sharp
gait
so
he
held
the
roans
down
to
a
snail
pace
if
it
be
true
that
a
snail
natural
gait
is
not
a
trot
for
the
rest
of
the
way
while
they
talked
of
tom
meredith
and
books
and
music
and
discovered
that
they
differed
widely
about
ibsen
they
found
fisbee
in
the
yard
talking
to
judge
briscoe
as
they
drove
up
and
before
the
horses
had
quite
stopped
helen
leaped
to
the
ground
and
ran
to
the
old
scholar
with
both
her
hands
outstretched
to
him
he
looked
timidly
at
her
and
took
the
hands
she
gave
him
then
he
produced
from
his
pocket
a
yellow
telegraph
envelope
watching
her
anxiously
as
she
received
it
however
she
seemed
to
attach
no
particular
importance
to
it
and
instead
of
opening
it
leaned
toward
him
still
holding
one
of
his
hands
these
awful
old
men
harkless
groaned
inwardly
as
he
handed
the
horses
over
to
the
judge
i
dare
say
kiss
her
but
when
the
editor
and
willetts
had
gone
it
was
helen
who
kissed
fisbee
they
coming
out
to
spend
the
evening
are
they
asked
briscoe
nodding
to
the
young
men
as
they
set
off
down
the
road
lige
has
to
come
whether
he
wants
to
or
not
minnie
laughed
rather
consciously
it
his
turn
to
look
after
i
guess
he
wo
mind
coming
said
the
judge
well
returned
his
daughter
glancing
at
helen
who
stood
apart
reading
the
telegram
to
fisbee
i
know
if
he
follows
harkless
he
get
here
pretty
soon
after
supper
as
soon
as
the
moon
comes
up
the
editor
of
the
herald
was
late
to
his
supper
that
evening
it
was
dusk
when
he
reached
the
hotel
and
for
the
first
time
in
history
a
gentleman
sat
down
to
meat
in
that
house
of
entertainment
in
evening
dress
there
was
no
one
in
the
diningroom
when
he
went
in
the
other
boarders
had
finished
and
it
was
cynthia
evening
out
but
the
landlord
came
and
attended
to
his
guests
wants
himself
and
chatted
with
him
while
he
ate
there
a
picture
of
henry
clay
remarked
landis
in
obvious
relevancy
to
his
companion
attire
there
a
picture
of
henry
clay
somewheres
about
the
house
in
a
coat
governor
ray
spoke
here
in
one
in
early
times
bodeffer
says
except
it
was
higher
built
up
yourn
about
the
collar
and
had
brass
buttons
i
think
ole
man
wimby
was
here
the
landlord
continued
changing
the
subject
he
waited
around
fer
ye
a
good
while
he
mighty
wrought
up
sence
the
trouble
this
morning
an
wanted
to
see
ye
bad
i
do
know
you
seen
it
but
that
feller
knocked
your
hat
off
was
mighty
near
tore
to
pieces
in
the
crowd
before
he
got
away
some
the
boys
him
as
one
the
skillets
and
sicked
the
dogs
on
him
and
he
had
a
pretty
mean
time
of
it
wimby
says
the
folks
be
worse
ever
and
says
he
him
to
stick
close
to
town
says
he
do
anything
to
git
him
now
says
he
anything
i
told
him
you
would
take
no
stock
in
it
but
see
here
do
you
put
nothin
too
mean
fer
them
folks
i
tell
you
harkless
plenty
of
us
are
scared
fer
the
good
fellow
was
so
earnest
that
when
the
editor
meal
was
finished
and
he
would
have
departed
landis
detained
him
almost
by
force
until
the
arrival
of
willetts
who
the
landlord
knew
was
his
allotted
escort
for
the
evening
when
lige
came
wearing
a
new
tie
a
pink
one
he
had
hastened
to
buy
as
soon
as
his
engagements
had
allowed
him
the
opportunity
landis
hissed
a
savage
word
of
reproach
for
his
tardiness
in
his
ear
and
whisperingly
bade
him
not
let
the
other
out
of
reach
that
night
to
which
willetts
replied
with
a
nod
implying
his
trustworthiness
and
the
young
men
set
off
in
the
darkness
harkless
wondered
if
his
costume
were
not
an
injustice
to
his
companion
but
he
did
not
regret
it
he
would
wear
his
best
court
suit
his
laces
and
velvets
for
deference
to
that
lady
it
was
a
painful
thing
to
remember
his
dusty
rustiness
of
the
night
before
the
awful
carlow
cut
of
his
coat
and
his
formless
black
cravat
the
same
felt
hat
he
wore
again
perforce
but
it
was
brushed
brushed
almost
to
holes
in
spots
and
somehow
he
had
added
a
touch
of
shape
to
it
his
was
an
antique
fashions
had
changed
no
doubt
he
did
not
know
possibly
she
would
recognize
its
vintage
but
it
was
a
lige
walked
along
talking
harkless
answering
yes
and
no
at
random
the
air
was
like
champagne
to
him
the
road
under
foot
so
elastic
and
springy
that
he
felt
like
a
thoroughbred
before
a
race
he
wanted
to
lift
his
foot
at
every
step
he
had
so
much
energy
to
spare
in
the
midst
of
a
speech
of
lige
about
the
look
of
the
wheat
he
suddenly
gave
out
a
sigh
so
deep
so
heartfelt
so
vibrant
so
profound
that
willetts
turned
with
astonishment
but
when
his
eye
reached
his
companion
face
harkless
was
smiling
the
editor
extended
his
hand
shake
hands
lige
he
cried
the
moon
peeped
over
the
shoulder
of
an
eastern
wood
and
the
young
men
suddenly
descried
their
long
shadows
stretching
in
front
of
them
harkless
turned
to
look
at
the
silhouetted
town
the
and
roofs
and
the
methodist
church
spire
silvered
at
the
edges
do
you
see
that
town
willetts
he
asked
laying
his
fingers
on
his
companion
sleeve
that
the
best
town
in
the
united
states
i
always
kind
of
thought
you
did
much
like
it
said
the
other
puzzled
seemed
to
me
you
always
sort
of
wished
you
had
settled
a
little
further
on
they
passed
fisbee
he
was
walking
into
the
village
with
his
head
thrown
back
a
strange
thing
for
him
they
gave
him
a
friendly
greeting
and
passed
on
well
it
beats
me
observed
lige
when
the
old
man
was
out
of
hearing
he
there
to
supper
again
he
was
there
all
day
yesterday
and
with
at
the
lecture
and
at
the
deepo
day
before
and
he
looks
like
another
man
and
dressed
up
for
him
to
beat
thunder
what
do
you
expect
makes
him
so
thick
out
there
all
of
a
sudden
i
had
thought
about
it
the
judge
and
he
have
been
friends
a
good
while
have
they
yes
three
or
four
years
but
not
like
this
it
beats
he
all
upset
over
miss
sherwood
i
think
old
enough
to
be
her
grandfather
too
the
old
his
companion
stopped
him
dropping
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
listen
they
were
at
the
corner
of
the
briscoe
picket
fence
and
a
sound
lilted
through
the
stillness
a
touch
on
the
keys
that
harkless
knew
listen
he
whispered
it
was
the
moonlight
sonata
that
helen
was
playing
it
a
pretty
piece
observed
lige
after
a
time
john
could
have
choked
him
but
he
answered
yes
it
is
who
made
it
up
pursued
willetts
foreigner
i
expect
yet
in
some
way
or
another
makes
me
think
of
fishing
down
on
the
wabash
bend
in
vigo
and
camping
out
nights
like
this
it
a
mighty
pretty
country
around
there
especially
at
the
sonata
was
finished
and
then
she
sang
sang
the
angel
as
the
soft
soprano
lifted
and
fell
in
the
modulations
of
that
song
there
was
in
its
timbre
apart
from
the
pure
amber
music
of
it
a
questing
seeking
pathos
and
willetts
felt
the
hand
on
his
shoulder
tighten
and
then
relax
and
as
the
song
ended
he
saw
that
his
companion
eyes
were
shining
and
moist
chapter
ix
night
it
is
bad
luck
to
sing
before
breakfast
there
was
a
lace
of
faint
mists
along
the
creek
and
beyond
when
john
and
helen
reached
their
bench
of
course
they
went
back
there
and
broken
roundelays
were
croaking
from
a
bayou
up
the
stream
where
rakish
frogs
held
carnival
in
resentment
of
the
lonesomeness
the
air
was
still
and
close
hundreds
of
coquetted
with
the
darkness
amongst
the
trees
across
the
water
glinting
from
unexpected
spots
shading
their
little
lanterns
for
a
second
to
glow
again
from
other
shadows
the
sky
was
a
wonderful
olive
green
a
lazy
cloud
drifted
in
it
and
lapped
itself
athwart
the
moon
the
dead
painters
design
the
skies
for
us
each
day
and
night
i
think
helen
said
as
she
dropped
a
little
scarf
from
her
shoulders
and
leaned
back
on
the
bench
it
must
be
the
only
way
to
keep
them
happy
and
busy
there
they
let
them
take
turns
and
those
not
on
duty
probably
float
around
and
they
given
a
good
man
his
turn
said
john
some
quiet
colorist
a
poetic
friendly
soul
no
turner
though
i
think
i
seen
a
turner
sunset
or
two
in
it
was
a
sculptor
sunset
this
evening
did
you
see
it
great
massy
clouds
piled
heap
on
heap
almost
with
violence
i
sure
it
was
michelangelo
the
judge
did
think
it
meant
michelangelo
he
thought
it
meant
michelangelo
gets
a
chance
rather
often
does
he
considering
the
number
of
art
people
there
must
be
over
there
i
believe
i
seen
a
good
many
sunsets
of
his
and
a
few
dawns
too
the
dawns
not
for
a
long
time
i
used
to
see
them
more
frequently
toward
the
close
of
senior
year
when
we
sat
up
all
night
talking
knowing
we
lose
one
another
soon
and
trying
to
hold
on
as
long
as
we
she
turned
to
him
with
a
little
frown
why
have
you
never
let
tom
meredith
know
you
were
living
so
near
him
less
than
a
hundred
miles
when
he
has
always
liked
and
admired
you
above
all
the
rest
of
mankind
i
know
that
he
has
tried
time
and
again
to
hear
of
you
but
the
other
men
wrote
that
they
knew
nothing
that
it
was
thought
you
had
gone
abroad
i
had
heard
of
you
and
so
must
he
have
seen
your
name
in
the
rouen
papers
about
the
and
in
politics
but
he
would
never
dream
of
connecting
the
plattville
harkless
with
harkless
though
did
just
a
little
and
rather
vaguely
i
knew
of
course
when
you
came
into
the
lecture
but
why
have
you
written
to
my
cousin
rouen
seems
a
long
way
from
here
he
answered
quietly
i
only
been
there
once
half
a
day
on
business
except
that
i
never
been
further
away
than
amo
or
gainesville
for
a
convention
or
to
make
a
speech
since
i
came
wicked
she
exclaimed
to
shut
yourself
up
like
this
i
said
it
was
fine
to
drop
out
of
the
world
but
why
have
you
cut
off
your
old
friends
from
you
why
have
you
had
a
relapse
now
and
then
and
come
over
to
hear
ysaye
play
and
melba
sing
or
to
see
mansfield
or
henry
irving
when
we
have
had
them
and
do
you
think
you
been
quite
fair
to
tom
what
right
had
you
to
assume
that
he
had
forgotten
you
oh
i
did
exactly
mean
forgotten
he
said
pulling
a
blade
of
grass
to
and
fro
between
his
fingers
staring
at
it
absently
it
only
that
i
have
dropped
out
of
the
world
you
know
i
kept
track
of
every
one
saw
most
of
my
friends
or
corresponded
now
and
then
for
a
year
or
so
after
i
left
college
but
people
do
miss
you
much
after
a
while
they
rather
expected
me
to
do
a
lot
of
things
in
a
way
you
know
and
i
was
doing
them
i
was
glad
to
get
away
i
always
had
an
itch
for
newspaper
work
and
i
went
on
a
new
york
paper
maybe
it
was
the
wrong
paper
at
least
i
was
fit
for
it
there
was
something
in
the
side
of
life
i
saw
too
not
only
on
the
paper
that
made
me
and
then
the
rush
and
fight
and
scramble
to
be
first
to
beat
the
other
man
probably
i
am
too
squeamish
i
saw
classmates
and
college
friends
diving
into
it
bound
to
come
out
ahead
dear
old
honest
frank
fellows
who
had
been
so
and
kind
and
gay
growing
too
busy
to
meet
and
be
good
to
any
man
who
could
be
good
to
them
asking
more
delicately
the
eternal
question
does
it
get
me
you
might
think
i
with
unkindness
but
it
was
not
so
it
was
the
other
way
more
than
i
deserved
but
the
cruel
competition
the
thousands
fighting
for
places
the
multitude
scrambling
for
each
baton
the
cold
faces
on
the
streets
perhaps
it
all
right
and
good
of
course
it
has
to
but
i
wanted
to
get
out
of
it
though
i
did
want
to
come
that
was
chance
a
new
man
bought
the
paper
i
was
working
for
and
its
policy
changed
many
of
the
same
men
still
wrote
for
it
facing
cheerfully
about
and
advocating
a
tricky
theory
vehement
champions
of
a
set
of
personal
schemers
and
waxy
he
spoke
with
feeling
but
now
as
though
a
trifle
ashamed
of
too
much
seriousness
and
justifiably
afraid
of
talking
like
one
of
his
own
editorials
he
took
a
lighter
tone
i
had
been
taken
on
the
paper
through
a
friend
and
not
through
merit
and
by
the
same
undeserved
kindly
influence
after
a
month
or
so
i
was
set
to
writing
short
political
editorials
and
was
at
it
nearly
two
years
when
the
paper
changed
hands
the
new
proprietor
indicated
that
he
would
be
willing
to
have
me
stay
and
write
the
other
way
i
refused
and
it
became
somewhat
plain
to
me
that
i
was
beginning
to
be
a
failure
a
cousin
of
mine
the
only
relative
i
had
died
in
chicago
and
i
went
to
his
funeral
i
happened
to
hear
of
the
carlow
through
an
agent
there
the
most
eloquent
gentleman
i
ever
met
i
was
younger
and
even
more
thoughtless
than
now
and
i
had
a
little
money
and
i
handed
it
over
for
the
i
wanted
to
run
a
paper
myself
and
to
build
up
a
power
and
then
though
i
only
lived
here
the
first
few
years
of
my
life
and
all
the
rest
of
it
had
been
spent
in
the
east
i
was
born
in
indiana
and
in
a
way
the
thought
of
coming
back
to
a
in
my
native
state
appealed
to
me
i
always
had
a
dim
sort
of
feeling
that
the
people
out
in
these
parts
knew
more
had
more
sense
and
were
less
artificial
i
mean
and
were
kinder
and
tried
less
to
be
somebody
else
than
almost
any
other
people
anywhere
and
i
believe
it
so
it
dull
here
in
carlow
of
course
that
is
it
used
to
be
the
agent
explained
that
i
could
make
the
paper
a
daily
at
once
with
an
enormous
circulation
in
the
country
i
was
very
very
young
then
i
came
here
and
saw
what
i
had
got
possibly
it
is
because
i
am
sensitive
that
i
never
let
tom
know
they
expected
me
to
amount
to
something
but
i
believe
his
welcome
would
be
less
hearty
to
a
failure
he
is
a
good
failure
she
cried
and
clapped
her
hands
and
laughed
i
really
not
very
tragic
about
it
though
i
must
seem
consumed
with
he
returned
smiling
it
is
only
that
i
have
dropped
out
of
the
world
while
tom
is
still
in
dropped
out
of
the
world
she
echoed
impatiently
ca
you
see
you
dropped
into
it
that
you
last
night
i
was
honored
by
your
praise
of
my
graceful
mode
of
quitting
it
and
so
you
wish
me
to
be
consistent
she
retorted
scornfully
what
becomes
of
your
gallantry
when
abide
by
reason
true
enough
equality
is
a
denial
of
and
privilege
is
a
denial
of
equality
i
do
like
that
at
she
turned
a
serious
suddenly
illuminated
face
upon
him
and
spoke
earnestly
it
my
hobby
i
should
tell
you
and
i
very
tired
of
that
nonsense
about
always
sounding
the
personal
note
it
be
sounded
as
we
would
sound
it
and
i
think
we
could
bear
the
loss
of
he
laughed
and
raised
a
protesting
hand
but
no
you
could
it
the
ribbon
of
superiority
in
your
buttonhole
i
know
several
women
who
manage
to
live
without
men
to
open
doors
for
them
and
i
think
i
could
bear
to
let
a
man
pass
before
me
now
and
then
or
wear
his
hat
in
an
office
where
i
happened
to
be
and
i
could
get
my
own
ice
at
a
dance
i
think
possibly
with
even
less
fuss
and
scramble
than
i
sometimes
observed
in
the
young
men
who
have
done
it
for
me
but
you
know
you
would
never
let
us
do
things
for
ourselves
no
matter
what
legal
equality
might
be
declared
even
when
we
get
representation
for
our
taxation
you
will
never
be
able
to
deny
yourselves
giving
us
our
i
hate
being
waited
on
i
rather
do
things
for
she
was
so
earnest
in
her
satire
so
full
of
scorn
and
so
serious
in
her
meaning
and
there
was
such
a
contrast
between
what
she
said
and
her
person
she
looked
so
preeminently
the
pretty
marquise
all
silks
and
softness
the
little
exquisite
so
essentially
to
be
waited
on
and
helped
to
have
cloaks
thrown
over
the
dampness
for
her
to
tread
upon
to
be
run
about
for
he
could
see
half
a
dozen
youths
rushing
about
for
her
ices
for
her
carriage
for
her
chaperone
for
her
wrap
at
dances
that
to
save
his
life
he
could
not
repress
a
chuckle
he
managed
to
make
it
inaudible
however
and
it
was
as
well
that
he
did
i
understand
your
love
of
newspaper
work
she
went
on
less
vehemently
but
not
less
earnestly
i
have
always
wanted
to
do
it
myself
wanted
to
immensely
i
ca
think
of
any
more
fascinating
way
of
earning
one
living
and
i
know
i
could
do
it
why
do
you
make
the
a
daily
to
hear
her
speak
of
earning
one
living
was
too
much
for
him
she
gave
the
impression
of
riches
not
only
for
the
fine
texture
and
fashioning
of
her
garments
but
one
felt
that
luxuries
had
wrapped
her
from
her
birth
he
had
not
had
much
time
to
wonder
what
she
did
in
plattville
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
a
little
odd
that
she
could
plan
to
spend
any
extent
of
time
there
even
if
she
had
liked
minnie
briscoe
at
school
he
felt
that
she
must
have
been
sheltered
and
petted
and
waited
on
all
her
life
one
could
not
help
yearning
to
wait
on
her
he
answered
inarticulately
oh
some
day
in
reply
to
her
question
and
then
burst
into
outright
laughter
i
might
have
known
you
would
take
me
seriously
she
said
with
no
indignation
only
a
sad
wistfulness
i
am
well
used
to
it
i
think
it
is
because
i
am
not
tall
people
take
big
girls
with
more
gravity
big
people
are
nearly
always
listened
listened
to
he
said
and
felt
that
he
must
throw
himself
on
his
knees
before
her
you
ought
to
mind
being
titania
she
was
listened
to
you
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
her
eyes
flashed
do
you
think
personal
comment
is
ever
in
good
taste
she
cried
fiercely
and
in
his
surprise
he
almost
fell
off
the
bench
if
there
is
one
thing
i
can
not
bear
it
is
to
be
told
that
i
am
i
am
not
every
one
who
is
a
giantess
is
i
personalities
i
am
a
great
deal
over
five
feet
a
great
deal
more
than
that
i
please
he
said
i
did
do
say
you
are
sorry
she
interrupted
and
in
spite
of
his
contrition
he
found
her
angry
voice
delicious
it
was
still
so
sweet
hot
with
indignation
but
ringing
not
harsh
do
say
you
did
mean
it
because
you
did
you
ca
unsay
it
you
can
not
alter
it
ah
she
drew
in
her
breath
with
a
sharp
sigh
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
sank
back
upon
the
bench
i
will
not
cry
she
said
not
so
firmly
as
she
thought
she
did
my
blessed
child
he
cried
in
great
distress
and
perturbation
what
have
i
done
i
i
call
me
all
you
like
she
answered
i
do
care
it
that
you
must
think
me
such
an
she
dropped
her
hands
from
her
face
and
shook
the
tears
from
her
eyes
with
a
mournful
laugh
he
saw
that
her
hands
were
clenched
tightly
and
her
lip
trembled
i
will
not
cry
she
said
in
a
low
voice
somebody
ought
to
murder
me
i
ought
to
have
thought
personalities
hideous
do
it
was
i
ought
to
be
shot
ah
please
do
say
that
she
said
shuddering
please
do
not
even
as
a
joke
after
last
but
i
ought
to
be
for
hurting
you
indeed
she
laughed
sadly
again
it
was
that
i
do
care
what
you
call
me
i
am
small
you
try
to
forgive
me
for
being
such
a
baby
i
mean
anything
i
said
i
have
acted
so
badly
since
i
was
a
it
my
fault
all
of
it
i
tired
you
out
and
i
let
you
get
into
that
crush
at
the
circus
he
was
going
on
remorsefully
she
interrupted
i
do
think
i
would
have
missed
the
he
had
a
thrilling
hope
that
she
meant
the
she
looked
as
if
she
meant
that
but
he
dared
not
let
himself
believe
it
no
he
continued
i
have
been
so
madly
happy
in
being
with
you
that
i
fairly
worn
out
your
patience
i
haunted
you
all
day
and
i
have
all
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
she
said
slowly
just
after
you
left
this
afternoon
i
found
that
i
could
not
stay
here
my
people
are
going
abroad
to
dresden
at
once
and
i
must
go
with
them
that
what
almost
made
me
cry
i
leave
he
felt
something
strike
at
his
heart
in
the
sudden
sense
of
dearth
he
had
no
astonishment
that
she
should
betray
such
agitation
over
her
departure
from
a
place
she
had
known
so
little
and
friends
who
certainly
were
not
part
of
her
life
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
resting
his
arm
against
a
sycamore
stood
staring
away
from
her
at
nothing
she
did
not
move
there
was
a
long
silence
he
had
wakened
suddenly
the
skies
had
been
sapphire
the
sward
emerald
plattville
a
camelot
of
romance
to
be
there
enchantment
and
now
like
a
meteor
burned
out
in
a
breath
the
necromancy
fell
away
and
he
gazed
into
desolate
years
the
thought
of
the
square
his
dusty
office
the
bleak
length
of
main
street
as
they
should
appear
gave
him
a
faint
physical
sickness
it
had
all
been
touched
to
beauty
he
had
felt
fit
to
live
and
work
there
a
thousand
years
a
fool
dream
and
the
waking
was
to
emptiness
he
should
die
now
of
hunger
and
thirst
in
that
sahara
he
hoped
the
fates
would
let
it
be
soon
but
he
knew
they
would
not
knew
that
this
was
hysteria
that
in
his
endurance
he
should
plod
on
plod
plod
dustily
on
through
dingy
lonely
years
there
was
a
rumble
of
thunder
far
out
on
the
western
prairie
a
cold
breath
stole
through
the
hot
stillness
and
an
arm
of
vapor
reached
out
between
the
moon
and
the
quiet
earth
darkness
fell
the
man
and
the
girl
kept
silence
between
them
they
might
have
been
two
sad
guardians
of
the
black
little
stream
that
splashed
unseen
at
their
feet
now
and
then
an
echo
of
far
away
lightning
faintly
illumined
them
with
a
green
light
thunder
rolled
nearer
ominously
the
gods
were
driving
their
chariots
over
the
bridge
the
chill
breath
passed
leaving
the
air
again
to
its
hot
inertia
i
did
not
want
to
go
she
said
at
last
with
tears
just
below
the
surface
of
her
voice
i
wanted
to
stay
here
but
he
they
would
i
wanted
to
stay
here
he
said
huskily
not
turning
here
in
rouen
you
mean
in
in
plattville
he
turned
now
astounded
yes
would
you
have
taken
me
on
the
she
rose
and
came
toward
him
i
could
have
supported
myself
here
if
you
would
and
studied
how
newspapers
are
made
i
know
i
could
have
earned
a
wage
we
could
have
made
it
a
he
searched
in
vain
for
a
trace
of
raillery
in
her
voice
there
was
none
she
seemed
to
intend
her
words
to
be
taken
literally
i
do
understand
he
said
i
do
know
what
you
i
mean
that
i
want
to
stay
here
that
i
ought
to
stay
here
that
my
conscience
tells
me
i
should
but
i
ca
and
it
makes
me
very
unhappy
that
was
why
i
acted
so
your
conscience
he
cried
oh
i
know
what
a
jumble
and
puzzle
it
must
seem
to
i
only
know
one
thing
that
you
are
going
away
morning
and
that
i
shall
never
see
you
the
darkness
had
grown
heavy
they
could
not
see
each
other
but
a
wan
glimmer
gave
him
a
fleeting
misty
view
of
her
she
stood
away
from
him
her
hand
to
her
cheek
in
the
uncertain
fashion
of
his
great
moment
of
the
afternoon
her
saw
in
the
flying
picture
that
he
caught
were
adorably
troubled
and
her
hand
trembled
she
had
been
irresistible
in
her
gaiety
but
now
that
a
mysterious
distress
assailed
her
the
reason
for
which
he
had
no
guess
she
was
so
divinely
pathetic
and
seemed
such
a
rich
and
lovely
and
sad
and
happy
thing
to
have
come
into
his
life
only
to
go
out
of
it
and
he
was
so
full
of
the
prophetic
sense
of
loss
of
her
it
seemed
so
much
like
losing
everything
that
he
found
too
much
to
say
to
be
able
to
say
anything
he
tried
to
speak
and
choked
a
little
a
big
drop
of
rain
fell
on
his
bare
head
neither
of
them
noticed
the
weather
or
cared
for
it
they
stood
with
the
renewed
blackness
hanging
like
a
thick
drapery
between
them
can
can
you
tell
me
why
you
think
you
ought
not
to
go
he
whispered
finally
with
a
great
effort
no
not
now
but
i
know
you
would
think
i
am
right
in
wanting
to
stay
she
cried
impulsively
i
know
you
would
if
you
knew
about
it
but
i
ca
i
ca
i
must
go
in
the
i
should
always
think
you
right
he
answered
in
an
unsteady
tone
always
he
went
over
to
the
bench
fumbled
about
for
his
hat
and
picked
it
up
come
he
said
gently
i
am
going
she
stood
quite
motionless
for
a
full
minute
or
longer
then
without
a
word
she
moved
toward
the
house
he
went
to
her
with
hands
extended
to
find
her
and
his
fingers
touched
her
sleeve
then
together
and
silently
they
found
the
and
followed
its
dim
length
in
the
orchard
he
touched
her
sleeve
again
and
led
the
way
as
they
came
out
behind
the
house
she
detained
him
stopping
short
she
shook
his
hand
from
her
arm
she
spoke
in
a
single
breath
as
if
it
were
all
one
word
will
you
tell
me
why
you
go
it
is
not
late
why
do
you
wish
to
leave
me
when
i
shall
not
see
you
again
the
lord
be
good
to
me
he
broke
out
all
his
passion
of
dreams
rushing
to
his
lips
now
that
the
barrier
fell
do
you
see
it
is
because
i
ca
bear
to
let
you
go
i
hoped
to
get
away
without
saying
it
i
want
to
be
alone
i
want
to
be
with
myself
and
try
to
realize
i
did
want
to
make
a
babbling
idiot
of
myself
but
i
am
it
is
because
i
do
want
another
second
of
your
sweetness
to
leave
an
added
pain
when
you
gone
it
is
because
i
do
want
to
hear
your
voice
again
to
have
it
haunt
me
in
the
loneliness
you
will
leave
but
it
useless
useless
i
shall
hear
it
always
just
as
i
shall
always
see
your
face
just
as
i
have
heard
your
voice
and
seen
your
face
these
seven
years
ever
since
i
first
saw
you
a
child
at
winter
harbor
i
forgot
for
a
while
i
thought
it
was
a
girl
i
had
made
up
out
of
my
own
heart
but
it
was
you
you
always
the
impression
i
thought
nothing
of
at
the
time
just
the
merest
touch
on
my
heart
light
as
it
was
grew
and
grew
deeper
until
it
was
there
forever
you
known
me
hours
and
i
understand
what
you
think
of
me
for
speaking
to
you
like
this
if
i
had
known
you
for
years
and
had
waited
and
had
the
right
to
speak
and
keep
your
respect
what
have
i
to
offer
you
i
could
even
take
care
of
you
if
you
went
mad
as
i
and
listened
i
no
excuse
for
this
raving
yes
i
have
he
saw
her
in
another
second
of
lightning
a
sudden
bright
one
her
back
was
turned
to
him
she
had
taken
a
few
startled
steps
from
him
ah
he
cried
you
are
glad
enough
now
to
see
me
go
i
knew
it
i
wanted
to
spare
myself
that
i
tried
not
to
be
a
hysterical
fool
in
your
he
turned
aside
and
his
head
fell
on
his
breast
god
help
me
he
said
what
will
this
place
be
to
me
now
the
breeze
had
risen
it
gathered
force
it
was
a
chill
wind
and
there
rose
a
wailing
on
the
prairie
drops
of
rain
began
to
fall
you
will
not
think
a
question
implied
in
this
he
said
more
composedly
and
with
an
unhappy
laugh
at
himself
i
believe
you
will
not
think
me
capable
of
asking
you
if
you
care
no
she
answered
i
i
do
not
love
ah
was
it
a
question
after
all
i
you
read
me
better
than
i
do
perhaps
but
if
i
asked
i
knew
the
she
made
as
if
to
speak
again
but
words
refused
her
after
a
moment
he
said
very
steadily
i
thank
you
for
the
charity
that
has
given
me
this
little
time
with
you
it
will
always
be
precious
to
me
i
shall
always
be
your
his
steadiness
did
not
carry
him
to
the
end
of
his
sentence
she
started
toward
him
and
stopped
without
his
seeing
her
she
answered
nothing
but
stretched
out
her
hand
to
him
and
then
let
it
fall
quickly
he
said
again
i
shall
go
out
the
orchard
gate
please
tell
them
for
me
wo
you
speak
to
me
he
stood
waiting
while
the
rising
wind
blew
their
garments
about
them
she
leaned
against
the
wall
of
the
house
wo
you
say
and
tell
me
you
can
forget
my
she
did
not
speak
no
he
cried
wildly
since
you
do
forget
it
i
have
spoiled
what
might
have
been
a
pleasant
memory
for
you
and
i
know
it
you
were
already
troubled
and
i
have
added
and
you
wo
forget
it
nor
shall
i
nor
shall
i
do
say
i
can
say
it
for
both
of
us
god
bless
you
and
he
crushed
his
hat
down
over
his
eyes
and
ran
toward
the
orchard
gate
for
a
moment
lightning
flashed
repeatedly
she
saw
him
go
out
the
gate
and
disappear
into
sudden
darkness
he
ran
through
the
field
and
came
out
on
the
road
heaven
and
earth
were
revealed
again
for
a
dazzling
white
second
from
horizon
to
horizon
rolled
clouds
contorted
like
an
illimitable
field
of
inverted
haystacks
and
beneath
them
enormous
volumes
of
pale
vapor
were
tumbling
in
the
west
advancing
eastward
with
sinister
swiftness
she
ran
to
a
little
knoll
at
the
corner
of
the
house
and
saw
him
set
his
face
to
the
storm
she
cried
aloud
to
him
with
all
her
strength
and
would
have
followed
but
the
wind
took
the
words
out
of
her
mouth
and
drove
her
back
cowering
to
the
shelter
of
the
house
out
on
the
road
the
dust
came
lashing
and
stinging
him
like
a
thousand
nettles
it
smothered
him
and
beat
upon
him
so
that
he
covered
his
face
with
his
sleeve
and
fought
into
the
storm
shoulder
foremost
dimly
glad
of
its
rage
scarcely
conscious
of
it
keeping
westward
on
his
way
to
nowhere
west
or
east
south
or
north
it
was
all
one
to
him
the
few
heavy
drops
that
fell
boiling
into
the
dust
ceased
to
come
the
rain
withheld
while
the
rode
on
earth
on
he
went
in
spite
of
them
on
and
on
running
blindly
when
he
could
run
at
all
at
least
the
were
company
he
had
been
so
long
alone
he
could
remember
no
home
that
had
ever
been
his
since
he
was
a
little
child
neither
father
nor
mother
no
one
who
belonged
to
him
or
to
whom
he
belonged
except
one
cousin
an
old
man
who
was
dead
for
a
day
his
dreams
had
found
in
a
girl
eyes
the
precious
thing
that
is
called
home
oh
the
wild
fancy
he
laughed
aloud
there
was
a
startling
answer
a
lance
of
living
fire
hurled
from
the
sky
riving
the
fields
before
his
eyes
while
crash
on
crash
of
artillery
numbed
his
ears
with
that
his
awoke
and
he
looked
about
him
he
was
almost
two
miles
from
town
the
nearest
house
was
the
briscoes
far
down
the
road
he
knew
the
rain
would
come
now
there
was
a
big
oak
near
him
at
the
roadside
he
stepped
under
its
sheltering
branches
and
leaned
against
the
great
trunk
wiping
the
perspiration
and
dust
from
his
face
a
moment
of
stunned
quiet
had
succeeded
the
peal
of
thunder
it
was
followed
by
several
moments
of
incessant
lightning
that
played
along
the
road
and
danced
in
the
fields
from
that
intolerable
brightness
he
turned
his
head
and
saw
standing
against
the
fence
five
feet
away
a
man
leaning
over
the
top
rail
and
looking
at
him
the
same
flash
staggered
brilliantly
before
helen
eyes
as
she
crouched
against
the
back
steps
of
the
brick
house
it
scarred
a
picture
like
a
marine
of
big
waves
the
tossing
tops
of
the
orchard
trees
for
in
the
same
second
the
full
fury
of
the
storm
was
loosed
wind
and
rain
and
hail
it
drove
her
against
the
kitchen
door
with
cruel
force
the
latch
lifted
the
door
blew
open
violently
and
she
struggled
to
close
it
in
vain
the
house
seemed
to
rock
a
lamp
flickered
toward
her
from
the
inner
doorway
and
was
blown
out
helen
helen
came
minnie
voice
anxiously
is
that
you
we
were
coming
to
look
for
you
did
you
get
wet
willetts
threw
his
weight
against
the
door
and
managed
to
close
it
then
minnie
found
her
friend
hand
and
led
her
through
the
dark
hall
to
the
parlor
where
the
judge
sat
placidly
reading
by
a
lige
chuckled
as
they
left
the
kitchen
i
guess
you
did
try
too
hard
to
shut
that
door
harkless
he
said
and
then
when
they
came
into
the
lighted
room
why
where
harkless
he
asked
did
he
come
with
us
from
the
kitchen
no
answered
helen
faintly
he
she
sank
upon
the
sofa
and
drew
her
hand
across
her
eyes
as
if
to
shade
them
from
too
sudden
light
gone
the
judge
dropped
his
book
and
stared
across
the
table
at
the
girl
gone
when
ten
minutes
five
half
an
hour
i
do
know
before
the
storm
oh
the
old
gentleman
appeared
to
be
reassured
probably
he
had
work
to
do
and
wanted
to
get
in
before
the
but
lige
willetts
was
turning
pale
he
swallowed
several
times
with
difficulty
which
way
did
he
go
he
did
come
around
the
house
we
were
out
there
till
the
storm
he
went
by
the
orchard
gate
when
he
got
to
the
road
he
turned
that
she
pointed
to
the
west
he
must
have
been
crazy
exclaimed
the
judge
what
possessed
the
fellow
i
could
stop
him
i
did
know
she
looked
at
her
three
companions
slowly
and
with
growing
terror
from
one
face
to
another
minnie
eyes
were
wide
and
she
had
unconsciously
grasped
lige
arm
the
young
man
was
looking
straight
before
him
the
judge
got
up
and
walked
nervously
back
and
forth
helen
rose
to
her
feet
swiftly
and
went
toward
the
old
man
her
hands
pressed
to
her
bosom
ah
she
cried
out
sharply
i
had
forgotten
you
do
think
they
you
do
think
i
know
what
i
think
lige
broke
in
i
think
i
ought
to
be
hanged
for
letting
him
out
of
my
sight
maybe
it
all
right
maybe
he
turned
and
started
right
back
for
town
and
got
there
but
i
had
no
business
to
leave
him
and
if
i
can
i
catch
up
with
him
he
went
to
the
front
door
and
opening
it
let
in
a
tornado
of
wind
and
flood
of
water
that
beat
him
back
sheets
of
rain
blew
in
horizontally
in
spite
of
the
porch
beyond
briscoe
followed
him
do
be
a
fool
lige
he
said
you
hardly
expect
to
go
out
in
lige
shook
his
head
it
needed
them
both
to
get
the
door
closed
the
young
man
leaned
against
it
and
passed
his
sleeve
across
his
wet
brow
i
had
ought
to
have
left
do
scare
the
girls
whispered
the
other
then
in
a
louder
tone
all
i
afraid
of
is
that
he
get
blown
to
pieces
or
catch
his
death
of
cold
that
all
there
is
to
worry
about
those
scalawags
try
it
again
so
soon
after
last
night
i
not
bothering
about
that
not
at
all
that
need
worry
but
this
morning
pshaw
he
likely
home
and
dry
by
this
time
all
foolishness
do
be
an
old
the
two
men
reentered
the
room
and
found
helen
clinging
to
minnie
hand
on
the
sofa
she
looked
up
at
them
quickly
do
you
think
do
you
what
do
you
her
voice
shook
so
that
she
could
not
go
on
the
judge
pinched
her
cheek
and
patted
it
i
think
he
home
and
dry
but
i
think
he
got
wet
first
that
what
i
think
never
you
fear
a
good
hand
at
taking
care
of
himself
sit
down
lige
you
ca
go
for
a
nor
could
he
it
was
long
before
he
could
venture
out
the
storm
raged
and
roared
without
abatement
it
was
carlow
worst
since
the
old
gentleman
said
they
heard
the
great
limbs
crack
and
break
outside
while
the
thunder
boomed
and
the
wind
ripped
at
the
eaves
till
it
seemed
the
roof
must
go
meanwhile
the
judge
after
some
apology
lit
his
pipe
and
told
long
stories
of
the
storms
of
early
days
and
of
odd
freaks
of
the
wind
he
talked
on
calmly
the
picture
of
repose
and
blew
rings
above
his
head
but
helen
saw
that
one
of
his
big
slippers
beat
an
unceasing
little
tattoo
on
the
carpet
she
sat
with
fixed
eyes
in
silence
holding
minnie
hand
tightly
and
her
face
was
colorless
and
grew
whiter
as
the
slow
hours
dragged
by
every
moment
willetts
became
more
restless
though
assuring
the
ladies
he
had
no
anxiety
regarding
harkless
it
was
only
his
own
dereliction
of
duty
that
he
regretted
the
boys
would
have
the
laugh
on
him
he
said
but
he
visibly
chafed
more
and
more
under
the
stories
and
constantly
rose
to
peer
out
of
the
window
into
the
wrack
and
turmoil
or
uneasily
shifted
in
his
chair
once
or
twice
he
struck
his
hands
together
with
muttered
ejaculations
at
last
there
was
a
lull
in
the
fury
without
and
as
soon
as
it
was
perceptible
he
declared
his
intention
of
making
his
way
into
town
he
had
ought
to
have
went
before
he
declared
apprehensively
and
then
with
immediate
amendment
of
course
he
would
find
the
editor
at
work
in
the
herald
office
there
was
the
slightest
doubt
of
that
he
agreed
with
the
judge
but
he
better
see
about
it
he
would
return
early
in
the
morning
to
bid
miss
sherwood
hoped
she
come
back
some
day
hoped
it
was
her
last
visit
to
plattville
they
gave
him
an
umbrella
and
he
plunged
out
into
the
night
and
as
they
stood
watching
him
for
a
moment
from
the
door
the
old
man
calling
after
him
cheery
and
laughing
messages
to
harkless
they
could
hear
his
feet
slosh
into
the
puddles
and
see
him
fight
with
his
umbrella
when
he
got
out
into
the
road
helen
room
was
over
the
porch
the
windows
facing
north
looking
out
upon
the
pike
and
across
the
fields
beyond
please
do
light
the
lamp
minnie
she
said
when
they
had
gone
upstairs
i
do
need
a
miss
briscoe
was
flitting
about
the
room
hunting
for
matches
in
the
darkness
she
came
to
her
friend
and
laid
a
kind
large
hand
on
helen
eyes
and
the
hand
became
wet
she
drew
helen
head
down
on
her
shoulder
and
sat
beside
her
on
the
bed
sweetheart
you
must
fret
she
soothed
in
motherly
fashion
do
you
worry
dear
he
all
right
it
is
your
fault
dear
they
would
come
on
a
night
like
but
helen
drew
away
and
went
to
the
window
flattening
her
arm
against
the
pane
her
forehead
pressed
against
her
arm
she
had
let
him
go
she
had
let
him
go
alone
she
had
forgotten
the
danger
that
always
beset
him
she
had
been
so
crazy
she
had
seen
nothing
thought
of
nothing
she
had
let
him
go
into
that
and
into
the
storm
alone
who
knew
better
than
she
how
cruel
they
were
she
had
seen
the
fire
leap
from
the
white
blossom
and
heard
the
ball
whistle
the
ball
they
had
meant
for
his
heart
that
good
great
heart
she
had
run
to
him
the
night
before
why
had
she
let
him
go
into
the
unknown
and
the
storm
but
how
could
she
have
stopped
him
how
could
she
have
kept
him
after
what
he
had
said
she
peered
into
the
night
through
distorting
tears
the
wind
had
gone
down
a
little
but
only
a
little
and
the
electrical
flashes
danced
all
around
the
horizon
in
magnificent
display
sometimes
far
away
sometimes
dazingly
near
the
darkness
trebly
deep
between
the
intervals
when
the
long
sweep
of
flat
lands
lay
in
dazzling
clearness
in
the
washed
air
to
the
finest
detail
of
stricken
field
and
heaving
woodland
a
staggering
flame
clove
earth
and
sky
sheets
of
light
came
following
it
and
a
frightful
uproar
shook
the
house
and
rattled
the
casements
but
over
the
crash
of
thunder
minnie
heard
her
friend
loud
scream
and
saw
her
spring
back
from
the
window
with
both
hands
palm
outward
pressed
to
her
face
she
leaped
to
her
and
threw
her
arms
about
her
what
is
it
look
helen
dragged
her
to
the
window
at
the
next
flash
the
fence
beyond
the
meadow
what
was
it
what
was
it
like
the
lightning
flashed
incessantly
helen
tried
to
point
her
hand
only
jerked
from
side
to
side
she
cried
i
see
nothing
but
the
lightning
minnie
answered
breathlessly
oh
the
the
fence
and
in
the
field
what
was
it
she
panted
a
long
line
of
white
horrible
white
what
minnie
turned
from
the
window
and
caught
the
wrist
in
a
fluttering
clasp
minnie
minnie
like
long
white
gowns
and
cowls
crossing
the
helen
released
her
wrist
and
put
both
hands
on
minnie
cheeks
forcing
her
around
to
face
the
pane
you
must
look
you
must
look
she
cried
they
would
do
it
they
would
it
minnie
cried
they
could
come
in
the
storm
they
would
do
it
in
the
pouring
rain
yes
such
things
would
mind
the
rain
she
burst
into
hysterical
laughter
and
minnie
almost
as
unnerved
caught
her
about
the
waist
they
would
mind
the
rain
they
would
fear
a
storm
ha
ha
ha
yes
yes
and
i
let
him
go
i
let
him
go
pressing
close
together
shuddering
clasping
each
other
waists
the
two
girls
peered
out
at
the
flickering
landscape
up
from
the
distant
fence
that
bordered
the
northern
side
of
field
a
pale
pelted
flapping
thing
reared
itself
poised
and
seemed
just
as
the
blackness
came
again
to
drop
to
the
ground
did
you
but
minnie
had
thrown
herself
into
a
chair
with
a
laugh
of
wild
relief
my
darling
girl
she
cried
not
a
line
of
white
things
just
one
jones
old
scarecrow
and
we
saw
it
blown
down
no
no
no
i
saw
the
others
they
were
in
the
field
beyond
i
saw
them
when
i
looked
the
first
time
they
were
nearly
all
on
the
fence
this
time
we
saw
the
last
man
crossing
ah
i
let
him
go
alone
minnie
sprang
up
and
enfolded
her
no
you
dear
imagining
child
you
upset
and
nervous
that
all
the
matter
in
the
world
worry
do
child
it
all
right
harkless
is
home
and
safe
in
bed
long
ago
i
know
that
old
scarecrow
on
the
fence
like
a
book
so
unstrung
you
fancied
the
rest
he
all
right
do
you
bother
the
big
motherly
girl
took
her
companion
in
her
arms
and
rocked
her
back
and
forth
soothingly
and
petted
and
reassured
her
and
then
cried
a
little
with
her
as
a
girl
always
will
with
a
friend
then
she
left
her
for
the
night
with
many
a
cheering
word
and
tender
caress
get
to
sleep
dear
she
called
through
the
door
when
she
had
closed
it
behind
her
you
must
if
you
have
to
go
in
the
morning
it
just
breaks
my
heart
i
do
know
how
we
bear
it
without
you
father
will
miss
you
almost
as
much
as
i
will
do
bother
about
that
old
white
scarecrow
that
all
it
was
dear
dear
answered
a
plaintive
little
voice
helen
hot
cheek
pressed
the
pillow
and
tossed
from
side
to
side
by
and
by
she
turned
the
pillow
over
it
had
grown
wet
the
wind
blew
about
the
eaves
and
blew
itself
out
she
hardly
heard
it
sleep
would
not
come
she
got
up
and
laved
her
burning
eyes
then
she
sat
by
the
window
the
strength
was
spent
at
last
the
rain
grew
lighter
and
lighter
until
there
was
but
the
sound
of
running
water
and
the
drip
drip
on
the
tin
roof
of
the
porch
only
the
thunder
rumbling
in
the
distance
marked
the
storm
course
the
chariots
of
the
gods
rolling
further
and
further
away
till
they
finally
ceased
to
be
heard
altogether
the
clouds
parted
majestically
and
then
between
great
curtains
of
mist
the
was
seen
shining
in
the
east
the
night
was
hushed
and
the
peace
that
falls
before
dawn
was
upon
the
wet
flat
lands
somewhere
in
the
sodden
grass
a
swamped
cricket
chirped
from
an
outlying
flange
of
the
village
a
dog
howl
rose
mournfully
was
answered
by
another
far
away
and
by
another
and
another
the
sonorous
chorus
rose
above
the
village
died
away
and
quiet
fell
again
helen
sat
by
the
window
no
comfort
touching
her
heart
tears
coursed
her
cheeks
no
longer
but
her
eyes
were
wide
and
staring
and
her
lips
parted
for
the
hush
was
broken
by
the
far
clamor
of
the
bell
ringing
in
the
night
it
rang
and
rang
and
rang
and
rang
she
could
not
breathe
she
threw
open
the
window
the
bell
stopped
all
was
quiet
once
more
the
east
was
growing
gray
suddenly
out
of
the
stillness
there
came
the
sound
of
a
horse
galloping
over
a
wet
road
he
was
coming
like
mad
some
one
for
a
doctor
no
the
grew
louder
coming
out
from
the
town
coming
this
way
coming
faster
and
faster
coming
there
was
a
splashing
and
trampling
in
front
of
the
house
and
a
sharp
whoa
in
the
dim
gray
of
first
dawn
she
made
out
a
man
on
a
horse
he
drew
up
at
the
gate
a
window
to
the
right
of
hers
went
screeching
up
she
heard
the
judge
clear
his
throat
before
he
spoke
what
is
it
that
you
is
it
wiley
what
is
it
he
took
a
good
deal
of
time
and
coughed
between
the
sentences
his
voice
was
more
than
ordinarily
quiet
and
it
sounded
husky
what
is
it
wiley
judge
what
time
did
harkless
leave
here
last
night
and
which
way
did
he
go
there
was
a
silence
the
judge
turned
away
from
the
window
minnie
was
standing
just
outside
his
door
it
must
have
been
about
nine
was
it
father
she
called
in
a
shaking
voice
and
you
know
helen
thought
he
went
wiley
the
old
man
leaned
from
the
sill
again
yes
answered
the
man
on
horseback
wiley
he
left
about
nine
just
before
the
storm
they
think
he
went
much
obliged
willetts
is
so
upset
he
is
sure
of
wiley
the
old
man
voice
shook
minnie
began
to
cry
aloud
the
horseman
wheeled
about
and
turned
his
animal
head
toward
town
wiley
wiley
they
have
you
do
think
they
got
him
by
god
judge
said
the
man
on
horseback
i
afraid
they
have
chapter
x
the
bell
the
bell
ringing
in
the
night
no
hesitating
stroke
of
schofields
henry
no
uncertain
touch
was
on
the
rope
a
loud
wild
hurried
clamor
pealing
out
to
wake
the
a
rapid
clang
clang
that
struck
clear
in
to
the
spine
the
bell
had
tolled
for
the
death
of
morton
of
garfield
of
hendricks
had
rung
of
peace
after
the
war
and
after
political
campaigns
but
it
had
rung
as
it
was
ringing
now
only
three
times
once
when
hibbard
mill
burned
once
when
webb
landis
killed
sep
bardlock
and
intrenched
himself
in
the
and
would
not
be
taken
till
he
was
shot
through
and
through
and
once
when
the
rouen
accommodation
was
wrecked
within
twenty
yards
of
the
station
why
was
the
bell
ringing
now
men
and
women
startled
into
wide
wakefulness
groped
to
windows
no
red
mist
hung
over
town
or
country
what
was
it
the
bell
rang
on
its
loud
alarm
beat
increasingly
into
men
hearts
and
quickened
their
throbbing
to
the
rapid
measure
of
its
own
vague
forms
loomed
in
the
gloaming
a
horse
wildly
ridden
splashed
through
the
town
there
were
shouts
voices
called
hoarsely
lamps
began
to
gleam
in
the
windows
people
emerged
from
their
houses
men
slapping
their
braces
on
their
shoulders
as
they
ran
out
of
doors
questions
were
shouted
into
the
dimness
then
the
news
went
over
the
town
it
was
cried
from
yard
to
yard
from
group
to
group
from
gate
to
gate
and
reached
the
furthermost
confines
runners
shouted
it
as
they
sped
by
boys
panted
it
breathless
women
with
loosened
hair
stumbled
into
darkling
chambers
and
faltered
it
out
to
sleepers
pale
girls
clutching
wraps
at
their
throats
whispered
it
across
fences
the
sick
tossing
on
their
hard
beds
heard
it
the
bell
clamored
it
far
and
near
it
spread
over
the
it
flew
over
the
wires
to
distant
cities
the
had
got
harkless
lige
willetts
had
lost
track
of
him
out
near
briscoes
it
was
said
and
had
come
in
at
midnight
seeking
him
he
had
found
parker
the
herald
foreman
and
ross
schofield
the
typesetter
and
bud
tipworthy
the
devil
at
work
in
the
but
no
sign
of
harkless
there
or
in
the
cottage
together
these
had
sought
for
him
and
had
roused
others
who
had
inquired
at
every
house
where
he
might
have
gone
for
shelter
and
they
had
heard
nothing
they
had
watched
for
his
coming
during
the
slackening
of
the
storm
and
he
had
not
come
and
there
was
nowhere
he
could
have
gone
he
was
missing
only
one
thing
could
have
happened
they
had
roused
up
warren
smith
the
prosecutor
the
missing
most
intimate
friend
in
carlow
and
homer
the
sheriff
and
jared
wiley
the
deputy
william
todd
had
rung
the
alarm
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
find
him
after
that
there
would
be
trouble
if
not
before
it
looked
as
if
there
would
be
trouble
before
the
men
tramping
up
to
the
muddy
square
in
their
were
bulgy
about
the
right
hips
and
when
homer
tibbs
joined
lum
landis
at
the
hotel
corner
and
landis
saw
that
homer
was
carrying
a
landis
went
back
for
his
a
hastily
sworn
posse
galloped
out
main
street
women
and
children
ran
into
yards
and
began
to
cry
day
was
coming
and
as
the
light
grew
men
swore
and
savagely
kicked
at
the
palings
of
fences
that
they
passed
in
the
foreglow
of
dawn
they
gathered
in
the
square
and
listened
to
warren
smith
who
made
a
speech
from
the
fence
and
warned
them
to
go
slow
they
answered
him
with
angry
shouts
and
hootings
but
he
made
his
big
voice
heard
and
bade
them
do
nothing
rash
no
facts
were
known
he
said
it
was
far
from
certain
that
harm
had
been
done
and
no
one
knew
that
the
people
had
done
it
even
if
something
had
happened
to
harkless
he
declared
that
he
spoke
in
harkless
name
nothing
could
distress
so
much
as
for
them
to
defy
the
law
to
take
it
out
of
the
proper
hands
justice
would
be
done
yes
it
will
shouted
a
man
below
him
brandishing
the
butt
of
a
whip
above
his
head
and
while
you
jaw
on
about
it
here
he
may
be
tied
up
like
a
dog
in
the
woods
shot
full
of
holes
by
the
men
you
never
lifted
a
finger
to
hender
because
you
want
their
votes
when
you
run
for
circuit
judge
what
are
we
doin
what
the
good
of
listening
to
you
there
was
a
yell
at
this
and
those
who
heard
the
speaker
would
probably
have
started
for
the
without
further
parley
had
not
a
rumor
sprung
up
which
passed
so
rapidly
from
man
to
man
that
within
five
minutes
it
was
being
turbulently
discussed
in
every
portion
of
the
crowd
the
news
came
that
the
two
had
wrenched
a
bar
out
of
a
window
under
cover
of
the
storm
had
broken
jail
and
were
at
large
their
threats
of
the
day
before
were
remembered
now
with
convincing
vividness
they
had
sworn
repeatedly
to
bardlock
and
to
the
sheriff
and
in
the
hearing
of
others
that
they
would
do
for
the
man
who
took
their
money
from
them
and
had
them
arrested
the
prosecuting
attorney
quickly
perceiving
the
value
of
this
complication
in
holding
back
the
mob
that
was
already
forming
called
homer
from
the
crowd
and
made
him
get
up
on
the
fence
and
confess
that
his
prisoners
had
escaped
at
what
time
he
did
not
know
probably
toward
the
beginning
of
the
storm
when
it
was
noisiest
you
see
cried
the
attorney
there
is
nothing
as
yet
of
which
we
can
accuse
the
if
our
friend
has
been
hurt
it
is
much
more
likely
that
these
crooks
did
it
they
escaped
in
time
to
do
it
and
we
all
know
they
were
laying
for
him
you
want
to
be
mighty
careful
homer
is
already
in
telegraphic
communication
with
every
town
around
here
and
we
have
those
men
before
night
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
control
yourselves
a
little
and
go
home
he
could
see
that
his
words
except
those
in
reference
to
returning
home
no
one
was
going
home
made
an
impression
there
rose
a
babble
of
shouting
and
argument
and
swearing
that
grew
continually
louder
and
the
faces
the
lawyer
looked
down
on
were
creased
with
perplexity
and
shadowed
with
an
anger
that
settled
darker
and
darker
ephraim
watts
in
spite
of
all
confusion
clad
as
carefully
as
upon
the
preceding
day
deliberately
climbed
the
fence
and
stood
by
the
lawyer
and
made
a
single
steady
gesture
with
his
hand
he
was
listened
to
at
once
as
his
respect
for
the
law
was
less
notorious
than
his
irreverence
for
it
and
he
had
been
known
in
carlow
as
a
customarily
reckless
man
they
wanted
illegal
and
desperate
advice
and
quieted
down
to
hear
it
he
spoke
in
his
professionally
calm
voice
gentlemen
it
seems
to
me
that
smith
and
ribshaw
nodding
to
the
man
with
the
rawhide
whip
are
both
right
what
good
are
we
doing
here
what
we
want
to
know
is
what
happened
to
harkless
it
looks
just
now
like
the
might
have
done
it
let
find
out
what
they
done
scatter
and
hunt
for
him
as
anything
is
known
for
certain
hibbard
mill
whistle
will
blow
three
times
keep
on
looking
till
it
does
he
finished
with
a
barely
perceptible
scornful
smile
at
the
attorney
we
can
decide
on
what
had
ought
to
be
lay
dark
and
steaming
in
the
sun
that
morning
the
forge
was
silent
the
saloon
locked
up
the
roadway
deserted
even
by
the
pigs
the
broken
old
buggy
stood
rotting
in
the
mud
without
a
single
lean
little
old
man
or
woman
such
were
the
children
of
the
to
play
about
it
the
fields
were
empty
and
the
windows
blank
under
the
baleful
glance
of
the
horsemen
who
galloped
by
at
intervals
muttering
curses
not
always
confining
themselves
to
muttering
them
once
when
the
deputy
sheriff
rode
through
alone
a
tattered
black
hound
more
wolf
than
dog
growling
from
beneath
one
of
the
barns
and
was
jerked
back
into
the
darkness
by
his
tail
with
a
snarl
fiercer
than
his
own
while
a
shone
for
a
second
as
it
swung
for
a
stroke
on
the
head
the
hound
did
not
yelp
or
whine
when
the
blow
fell
he
shut
his
eyes
twice
and
slunk
sullenly
back
to
his
place
the
shanties
might
have
received
a
volley
or
two
from
some
of
the
mounted
bands
exasperated
by
futile
searching
had
not
the
escape
of
homer
prisoners
made
the
guilt
of
the
appear
doubtful
in
the
minds
of
many
as
the
morning
waned
the
advocates
of
the
theory
that
the
gamblers
had
made
away
with
harkless
grew
in
number
there
came
a
telegram
from
the
rouen
chief
of
police
that
he
had
a
clew
to
their
whereabouts
he
thought
they
had
succeeded
in
reaching
rouen
and
it
began
to
be
generally
believed
that
they
had
escaped
by
the
freight
which
had
stopped
to
take
on
some
empty
cars
at
a
a
mile
northwest
of
the
town
across
the
fields
from
the
briscoe
house
toward
noon
a
party
went
out
to
examine
the
railroad
embankment
men
began
to
come
back
into
the
village
for
breakfast
by
twos
and
threes
though
many
kept
on
searching
the
woods
not
feeling
the
need
of
food
or
caring
if
they
did
every
grove
and
clump
of
underbrush
every
thicket
was
ransacked
the
waters
of
the
creek
shallow
for
the
most
part
but
swollen
overnight
were
dragged
at
every
pool
nothing
was
found
there
was
not
a
sign
the
bar
of
the
hotel
was
thronged
all
morning
as
the
returning
citizens
rapidly
made
their
way
thither
and
those
who
had
breakfasted
and
were
going
out
again
paused
for
internal
as
well
as
external
reinforcement
the
landlord
himself
returned
from
a
long
hunt
set
up
his
whiskey
with
a
lavish
hand
he
was
the
best
man
we
had
boys
said
landis
as
he
poured
the
little
glasses
full
we
ort
of
sent
him
to
the
legislative
halls
of
washington
long
ago
he
of
done
us
honor
there
but
we
never
thought
of
doin
anything
fer
him
jest
set
and
let
him
build
up
the
town
and
give
him
empty
thankyes
drink
hearty
gentlemen
he
finished
gloomily
i
do
grudge
no
liquor
except
to
lige
he
was
a
good
man
said
young
william
todd
whose
nose
was
red
not
from
the
whiskey
i
about
give
schofields
henry
drew
his
sleeve
across
his
eyes
he
was
the
only
man
in
this
whole
city
that
did
jab
and
nag
at
me
when
i
done
my
best
he
exclaimed
with
an
increasing
break
in
his
utterance
many
a
good
word
i
had
from
him
when
nobody
in
town
done
nothin
but
laugh
rile
an
badger
me
about
my

the
postmaster

drops
from
his
beard
as
he
set
his
glass
on
the
bar

cried
a
voice
behind
him
turning
they
saw
lige
standing
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
that
led
to
the
street
in
his
hand
he
held
the
bridle
of
the
horse
he
had
ridden
across
the
sidewalk
and
that
now
stood
panting
with
lowered
head
half
through
the
doorway
beside
his
master
lige
was
hatless
splashed
with
mud
from
head
to
foot
his
jaw
was
set
his
teeth
ground
together
his
eyes
burned
under
red
lids
and
his
hair
lay
tossed
and
damp
on
his
brow
i
keep
out
of
no
man
way
he
repeated
hoarsely
i
heard
you
tibbs
but
i
got
too
much
to
do
while
you
loaf
and
gas
and
drink
over
lum
landis
bar
i
got
other
business
than
keeping
out
of
hartley
bowlder
way
i
looking
for
john
harkless
he
was
the
best
man
we
had
in
this
ornery
hole
and
he
was
too
good
for
us
and
so
we
maybe
let
him
get
killed
and
maybe
i
to
blame
but
going
to
find
him
and
if
he
hurt
damn
i
going
to
have
a
hand
on
the
rope
that
lifts
the
men
that
did
it
if
i
have
to
go
to
rouen
to
put
it
there
after
that
i
answer
for
my
fault
not
before
he
threw
himself
on
his
horse
and
was
gone
soon
the
room
was
emptied
as
the
patrons
of
the
bar
returned
to
the
search
and
only
wilkerson
and
the
landlord
remained
the
bar
being
the
professional
office
so
to
speak
of
both
wilkerson
had
a
chair
in
a
corner
where
he
sat
chanting
a
funeral
march
in
a
sepulchral
murmur
allowing
a
parenthetical
to
punctuate
the
dirge
in
place
of
the
drum
whenever
a
batch
of
newcomers
entered
he
rose
to
drink
with
them
and
at
such
times
after
pouring
off
his
liquor
with
a
rich
melancholy
shedding
tears
after
every
swallow
he
would
make
an
exploring
tour
of
the
room
on
his
way
back
to
his
corner
stopping
to
look
under
each
chair
inquiringly
and
ejaculate
why
where
kin
he
be
then
shaking
his
head
he
would
observe
sadly
fine
young
man
he
was
too
fine
young
man
pore
fellow
i
reckon
we
to
git
at
eleven
judge
briscoe
dropped
wearily
from
his
horse
at
his
own
gate
and
said
to
a
wan
girl
who
came
running
down
the
walk
to
meet
him
there
is
nothing
yet
i
sent
the
telegram
to
your
mother
to
helen
turned
away
without
answering
her
face
was
very
white
and
looked
pinched
about
the
mouth
she
went
back
to
where
old
fisbee
sat
on
the
porch
his
white
head
held
between
his
two
hands
he
was
rocking
himself
to
and
fro
she
touched
him
gently
but
he
did
not
look
up
she
spoke
to
him
there
is
anything
yet
he
sent
the
telegram
to
mamma
i
shall
stay
with
you
now
no
matter
what
you
she
sat
beside
him
and
put
her
head
down
on
his
shoulder
and
though
for
a
moment
he
appeared
not
to
notice
it
when
minnie
came
out
on
the
porch
hearing
her
father
at
the
door
the
old
scholar
had
put
his
arm
about
the
girl
and
was
stroking
her
fair
hair
softly
briscoe
glanced
at
them
and
raised
a
warning
finger
to
his
daughter
and
they
went
tiptoeing
into
the
house
where
the
judge
dropped
heavily
upon
a
sofa
with
an
asthmatic
sigh
he
was
worn
and
tired
minnie
stood
before
him
with
a
look
of
pale
inquiry
and
he
shook
his
head
no
use
to
tell
but
i
ca
see
any
hope
he
answered
her
biting
nervously
at
the
end
of
a
cigar
i
expect
you
better
bring
me
some
coffee
in
here
i
could
take
another
step
to
save
me
i
too
old
to
tear
around
the
country
horseback
before
breakfast
like
i
have
did
you
send
her
telegram
minnie
asked
as
he
drank
the
coffee
she
brought
him
she
had
interpreted
coffee
liberally
and
with
the
assistance
of
mildy
upton
whose
subdued
nose
was
frankly
red
and
who
shed
tears
on
the
raspberries
had
prepared
an
appetizing
table
at
his
elbow
yes
responded
the
judge
and
i
glad
she
sent
it
i
talked
the
other
way
yesterday
what
little
i
said
it
is
any
of
our
business
but
i
do
think
any
too
much
of
those
people
somehow
she
thinks
she
belongs
with
fisbee
and
i
guess
she
right
that
young
fellow
must
have
got
along
with
her
pretty
well
and
i
afraid
when
she
gives
up
she
be
pretty
bad
over
it
but
i
guess
we
all
will
terribly
sudden
somehow
though
it
only
what
everybody
half
expected
would
come
only
we
thought
it
would
come
from
over
he
nodded
toward
the
west
but
she
got
to
stay
here
with
us
boarding
at
sol
tibbs
with
that
old
man
wo
do
and
she
no
girl
to
live
in
two
rooms
you
fix
it
up
with
her
you
make
her
she
must
answered
his
daughter
as
she
knelt
beside
him
and
patted
his
coat
and
handed
him
several
things
to
eat
at
the
same
time
mr
fisbee
will
help
me
persuade
her
now
that
she
bound
to
stay
in
spite
of
him
and
the
sherwoods
too
i
think
she
is
perfectly
grand
to
do
it
always
thought
she
was
grand
ever
since
she
took
me
under
her
wing
at
school
when
i
was
terribly
and
frightened
but
she
was
so
sweet
and
kind
she
made
me
forget
she
was
the
pet
of
the
school
too
always
doing
things
for
the
other
girls
for
everybody
looking
out
for
people
simply
heads
and
heads
bigger
than
herself
and
so
recklessly
generous
and
so
funny
about
it
and
always
thoughtful
and
and
pleasant
minnie
was
speaking
sadly
mechanically
but
suddenly
she
broke
off
with
a
quick
sob
sprang
up
and
went
to
the
window
then
turning
cried
out
i
do
believe
it
he
knew
how
to
take
care
of
himself
too
well
have
got
away
from
her
father
shook
his
head
then
why
has
he
turned
up
he
have
gone
home
after
the
storm
if
something
bad
was
the
but
nothing
nothing
bad
could
have
happened
they
found
any
but
why
has
he
come
back
child
well
he
lying
hurt
somewhere
that
then
why
have
they
found
him
i
do
care
she
cried
and
choked
with
the
words
and
tossed
her
dishevelled
hair
from
her
temples
it
is
true
helen
wo
believe
it
why
should
i
it
only
a
few
hours
since
he
was
right
here
in
our
yard
talking
to
us
all
i
wo
believe
it
till
they
searched
every
stick
and
stone
of
and
found
it
was
the
said
the
old
gentleman
pushing
the
table
away
and
relaxing
his
limbs
on
the
sofa
they
probably
did
have
anything
to
do
with
it
we
thought
they
had
at
first
but
about
come
to
believe
it
was
those
two
devils
that
he
had
arrested
not
the
echoed
minnie
and
she
began
to
tremble
violently
have
they
been
out
there
yet
what
use
they
are
out
of
it
and
they
can
thank
god
they
are
they
are
not
she
cried
excitedly
they
did
it
it
was
the
we
saw
them
helen
and
the
judge
got
upon
his
feet
with
an
oath
he
had
not
sworn
for
years
until
that
morning
what
this
he
said
sharply
i
ought
to
have
told
you
before
but
we
were
so
frightened
and
and
you
went
off
in
such
a
rush
after
wiley
was
here
i
never
dreamed
everybody
would
know
it
was
the
that
they
would
of
any
one
else
and
i
looked
for
the
scarecrow
as
soon
as
it
was
light
and
it
was
off
from
where
we
saw
them
and
was
blown
down
at
all
and
helen
saw
them
in
the
field
besides
saw
all
of
them
he
interrupted
her
what
do
you
mean
try
to
tell
me
about
it
quietly
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
she
told
him
breathlessly
while
he
grew
more
and
more
visibly
perturbed
and
uneasy
biting
his
cigar
to
pieces
and
groaning
at
intervals
what
she
and
helen
had
seen
in
the
storm
when
she
finished
he
took
a
few
quick
turns
about
the
room
with
his
hands
thrust
deep
in
his
coat
pockets
and
then
charging
her
to
repeat
the
story
to
no
one
left
the
house
and
forgetting
his
fatigue
rapidly
crossed
the
fields
to
the
point
where
the
bizarre
figures
of
the
night
had
shown
themselves
to
the
two
girls
at
the
window
the
soft
ground
had
been
trampled
by
many
feet
the
pointed
to
the
northeast
he
traced
them
backward
to
the
southwest
through
the
field
and
saw
where
they
had
come
from
near
the
road
going
northeast
then
returning
he
climbed
the
fence
and
followed
them
northward
through
the
next
field
from
there
the
next
beyond
the
road
that
was
a
continuation
of
main
street
stretched
to
the
railroad
embankment
the
track
raggedly
defined
in
trampled
loam
and
muddy
furrow
bent
in
a
direction
which
indicated
that
its
terminus
might
be
the
switch
where
the
empty
cars
had
stood
last
night
waiting
for
the
freight
though
the
fields
had
been
trampled
down
in
many
places
by
the
searching
parties
he
felt
sure
of
the
direction
taken
by
the
men
and
he
perceived
that
the
searchers
had
mistaken
the
tracks
he
followed
for
those
of
earlier
parties
in
the
hunt
on
the
embankment
he
saw
a
number
of
men
walking
west
and
examining
the
ground
on
each
side
and
a
long
line
of
people
following
them
out
from
town
he
stopped
he
held
the
fate
of
in
his
hand
and
he
knew
it
he
knew
that
if
he
spoke
his
evidence
would
damn
the
and
that
it
meant
that
more
than
the
would
be
hurt
for
the
would
fight
if
he
had
believed
that
the
dissemination
of
his
knowledge
could
have
helped
harkless
he
would
have
called
to
the
men
near
him
at
once
but
he
had
no
hope
that
the
young
man
was
alive
they
would
not
have
dragged
him
out
to
their
shanties
wounded
or
as
a
prisoner
such
a
proceeding
would
have
courted
detection
and
also
they
were
not
that
kind
they
had
been
looking
for
him
a
long
time
and
their
one
idea
was
to
kill
him
and
harkless
for
all
his
gentleness
was
the
sort
of
man
briscoe
believed
who
would
have
to
be
killed
before
he
could
be
touched
of
one
thing
the
old
gentleman
was
sure
the
editor
had
not
been
tied
up
and
whipped
while
yet
alive
in
spite
of
his
easy
manners
and
geniality
there
was
a
dignity
in
him
that
would
have
made
him
kill
and
be
killed
before
the
dirty
fingers
of
a
could
have
been
laid
upon
him
in
chastisement
a
great
many
good
americans
of
carlow
who
knew
him
well
always
mistered
him
as
they
would
have
mistered
only
an
untitled
morton
or
hendricks
who
might
have
lived
amongst
them
he
was
the
only
man
the
old
darky
uncle
xenophon
had
ever
addressed
as
marse
since
he
came
to
plattville
thirty
years
ago
briscoe
considered
it
probable
that
a
few
people
were
wearing
bandages
in
the
closed
shanties
over
to
the
west
a
thought
of
the
number
they
had
brought
against
one
man
a
picture
of
the
unequal
struggle
of
the
young
fellow
he
had
liked
so
well
unarmed
and
fighting
hopelessly
in
a
trap
and
a
sense
of
the
cruelty
of
it
made
the
hot
anger
surge
up
in
his
breast
and
he
started
on
again
then
he
stopped
once
more
though
long
retired
from
faithful
service
on
the
bench
he
had
been
all
his
life
a
serious
exponent
of
the
law
and
what
he
went
to
tell
meant
lawlessness
that
no
one
could
hope
to
check
he
knew
the
temper
of
the
people
their
long
suffering
was
at
an
end
and
they
would
go
over
at
last
and
wipe
out
the
it
depended
on
him
if
the
mob
could
be
held
off
over
if
men
minds
could
cool
over
night
the
law
could
strike
and
the
innocent
and
the
hotheaded
be
spared
from
suffering
he
would
wait
he
would
lay
his
information
before
the
sheriff
and
horner
would
go
quietly
with
a
strong
posse
for
he
would
need
a
strong
one
he
began
to
retrace
his
steps
the
men
on
the
embankment
were
walking
slowly
bending
far
over
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
suddenly
one
of
them
stood
erect
and
tossed
his
arms
in
the
air
and
shouted
loudly
other
men
ran
to
him
and
another
far
down
the
track
repeated
the
shout
and
the
gesture
to
another
far
in
his
rear
this
man
took
it
up
and
shouted
and
waved
to
a
fourth
man
and
so
they
passed
the
signal
back
to
town
there
came
almost
immediately
three
long
loud
whistles
from
a
mill
near
the
station
and
the
embankment
grew
black
with
people
pouring
out
from
town
while
the
searchers
came
running
from
the
fields
and
woods
and
underbrush
on
both
sides
of
the
railway
briscoe
paused
for
the
last
time
then
he
began
to
walk
slowly
toward
the
embankment
the
track
lay
level
and
straight
not
dimming
in
the
middle
distances
the
rails
converging
to
points
both
northwest
and
southeast
in
the
air
like
examples
of
perspective
in
a
about
seventy
miles
to
the
west
and
north
lay
rouen
and
in
the
same
direction
nearly
six
miles
from
where
the
signal
was
given
the
track
was
crossed
by
a
road
leading
directly
south
to
the
embankment
had
been
newly
ballasted
with
sand
what
had
been
discovered
was
a
broad
brown
stain
on
the
south
slope
near
the
top
there
were
smaller
stains
above
and
below
none
beyond
it
to
left
or
right
and
there
were
deep
in
the
sand
men
were
examining
the
place
excitedly
talking
and
gesticulating
it
was
lige
willetts
who
had
found
it
his
horse
was
tethered
to
a
fence
near
by
at
the
end
of
a
lane
through
a
cornfield
jared
wiley
the
deputy
was
talking
to
a
group
near
the
stain
explaining
you
see
them
two
must
have
knowed
about
the
freight
and
that
it
was
to
stop
here
to
take
on
the
empty
lumber
cars
i
do
know
how

tom

looked
at
the
brown
stain
and
quickly
turned
away
then
he
went
back
slowly
to
the
village
on
the
way
he
passed
warren
smith
is
it
so
asked
the
lawyer
martin
answered
with
a
dry
throat
he
looked
out
dimly
over
the
sunlit
fields
and
swallowed
once
or
twice
yes
it
so
there
a
good
deal
of
it
there
little
more
than
a
boy
he
the
old
fellow
passed
his
seamy
hand
over
his
eyes
without
concealment
peter

he
added
brokenly
overlook

and
fisbee
and
me
and
all
of
us
old
husks
and
and
he
gulped
suddenly
then
finished
and
act
the
fool
and
take
a
boy
that
the
best
we
had
i
wish
the
almighty
would
take
peter
off
the
gate
he
ai
fit
fer
when
the
attorney
reached
the
spot
where
the
crowd
was
thickest
way
was
made
for
him
the
old
colored
man
xenophon
approached
at
the
same
time
leaning
on
a
hickory
stick
and
bent
very
far
over
one
hand
resting
on
his
hip
as
if
to
ease
a
rusty
joint
the
negro
age
was
an
incentive
to
fable
from
his
appearance
he
might
have
known
the
prophets
and
he
wore
that
hoary
look
of
unearthly
wisdom
many
decades
of
superstitious
experience
sometimes
give
to
members
of
his
race
his
face
so
tortured
with
wrinkles
that
it
might
have
been
made
of
innumerable
black
threads
woven
together
was
a
living
mask
of
the
mystery
of
his
blood
harkless
had
once
said
that
uncle
xenophon
had
visited
heaven
before
swedenborg
and
hell
before
dante
as
he
slowly
limped
over
the
ties
his
eyes
were
bright
and
dry
under
the
solemn
lids
and
though
his
heavy
nostrils
were
unusually
distended
in
the
effort
for
regular
breathing
the
deeply
puckered
lips
beneath
them
were
set
firmly
he
stopped
and
looked
at
the
faces
before
him
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
gentle
and
though
the
tremulousness
of
age
harped
on
the
vocal
strings
it
was
rigidly
controlled

at

still

he

i

but
somehow
he
paused
the

he
cried
they

my

saw
them
crossing
the

in
the
night
saw
them
climb

and
all
a

the

the

saw

several

the

were
coming

they
must
have
been

they
got
him
at

if
there
a

a

rang
out
above
the

followed
the

speech
him
back

he
wo

ridden
his

up
the
embankment
and
the
horse
stood
between
the
rails
there
was
an
angry
roar
from
the
crowd
the
prosecutor
pleaded
and
threatened
unheeded
and
as
for
the
deputy
sheriff
he
declared
his
intention
of
taking
with
him
all
who
wished
to
go
as
his
posse
eph

succeeded
in
making
himself
heard
above
the

the

he
shouted
start

we
want
everybody

we
need

we
want

there
was
a

clang
and

behind

and
a
steam
whistle
shrieked
the
crowd
divided
and
hartley
sorrel
jumped
just
in
time
as
the
westbound
accommodation
rushed
through
on
its
way
to
rouen
from
the
rear
platform
leaned
the
sheriff
horner
waving
his
hands
frantically
as
he
flew
by
but
no
one
understood
or
cared
what
he
said
or
in
the
general
excitement
even
wondered
why
he
was
leaving
the
scene
of
his
duty
at
such
a
time
when
the
train
had
dwindled
to
a
dot
and
disappeared
and
the
noise
of
its
rush
grew
faint
the
bell
was
heard
ringing
and
the
mob
was
piling
into
the
village
to
form
on
the
square
the
judge
stood
alone
on
the
embankment
that
settles
it
he
said
aloud
gloomily
watching
the
last
figures
he
took
off
his
hat
and
pushed
back
the
thick
white
hair
from
his
forehead
nothing
to
do
but
wait

as
well

for

impatiently

horsemen
had
been
galloping
through
sometimes
singly
oftener
in
company
at
the
last
posse
passed
through
on
its
return
to
the
and
after
that
there
was
a
long
complete
silence
while
the
miry
corners
were
undisturbed
by
a
single
no
unkempt
colt
nickered
from
his
musty
stall
the
sparse
young
corn
that
was
used
to
rasp
and
chuckle
greenly
stood
rigid
in
the
fields
up
the
plattville
pike
despairingly
cackled
one
old
hen
with
her
wabbling
sailor
run
smit
with
a
superstitious
horror
of
nothing
in
the
stillness
she
hid
herself
in
the
shadow
underneath
a
rickety
barn
and
her
shrieking
ceased
only
on
the
wimby
farm
were
there
signs
of
life
the
old
lady
who
had
sent
harkless
roses
sat
by
the
window
all
morning
and
wiped
her
eyes
watching
the
horsemen
ride
by
sometimes
they
would
hail
her
and
tell
her
there
was
nothing
yet
about
her
husband
rattled
up
in
a
buckboard
and
got
out
the
late
and
more
authentic
which
he
carefully
cleaned
and
oiled
in
spite
of
its
hammerless
and
quite
useless
condition
sitting
meanwhile
by
the
window
opposite
his
wife
and
often
looking
up
from
his
work
to
shake
his
weak
fist
at
his
neighbors
domiciles
and
creak
decrepit
curses
and
denunciations
but
the
was
ready
it
knew
what
was
coming
now
frightened
desperate
sullen
it
was
ready
the
afternoon
wore
on
and
lengthening
shadows
fell
upon
a
peaceful
one
would
have
said
a
sleeping
country
the
pike
already
dusty
stretched
its
serene
length
between
green
borders
flecked
with
purple
and
yellow
and
white
weedflowers
and
the
tree
shadows
were
not
shade
but
warm
blue
and
lavender
glows
in
the
general
pervasion
of
still
bright
light
the
sky
curving
its
deep
unburnished
penetrable
blue
over
all
with
no
single
drift
of
fleece
upon
it
to
be
reflected
in
the
creek
that
wound
along
past
willow
and
sycamore
a
telegraphy
broke
the
quiet
like
a
volley
of
pistol
shots
but
far
eastward
on
the
pike
there
slowly
developed
a
soft
white
haze
it
grew
denser
and
larger
gradually
it
rolled
nearer
dimly
behind
it
could
be
discerned
a
darker
moving
nucleus
that
extended
far
back
upon
the
road
a
heavy
tremor
began
to
stir
the
air
faint
manifold
sounds
a
waxing
increasing
multitudinous
rumor
the
pike
ascended
a
long
slight
slope
leading
west
up
to
the
from
a
thicket
of
at
the
foot
of
this
slope
was
thrust
the
hard
lean
visage
of
an
undersized
girl
of
fourteen
her
fierce
eyes
examined
the
approaching
cloud
of
dust
intently
a
redness
rose
under
the
burnt
yellow
skin
and
colored
the
wizened
cheeks
they
were
coming
she
stepped
quickly
out
of
the
tangle
and
darted
up
the
road
running
with
the
speed
of
a
fleet
little
terrier
not
opening
her
lips
not
calling
out
but
holding
her
two
thin
hands
high
above
her
head
that
was
all
but
birnam
wood
was
come
to
dunsinane
at
last
and
the
messenger
sped
out
of
the
weeds
in
the
corners
of
the
snake
fence
in
the
upper
part
of
the
rise
silently
lifted
the
heads
of
men
whose
sallowness
became
a
sickish
white
as
the
child
flew
by
the
mob
was
carefully
organized
they
had
taken
their
time
and
had
prepared
everything
deliberately
knowing
that
nothing
could
stop
them
no
one
had
any
thought
of
concealment
it
was
all
as
open
as
the
light
of
day
all
done
in
the
broad
sunshine
nothing
had
been
determined
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
at
the
more
definite
than
that
the
place
was
to
be
wiped
out
that
was
comprehensive
enough
the
details
were
quite
certain
to
occur
they
were

regular

professional
oppressor

unruffled

preserving
peace
between
the
two
young
men
with
perfect
tact
and
they
kept
good
order
and
a
similitude
of
quiet
for
so
many
except
far
to
the
rear
where
old
wilkerson
was
bringing
up
the
tail
of
the
procession
dragging
a
wretched
yellow
dog
by
a
fastened
around
the
poor
cur
protesting
neck
the
knot
carefully
arranged
under
his
right
ear
in
spite
of
every
command
and
protest
wilkerson
had
marched
the
whole
way
uproariously
singing
john

the
sun
was
in
the
west
when
they
came
in
sight
of
the
and
the
cabins
on
the
low
slope
stood
out
angularly
against
the
radiance
beyond
as
they
beheld
the
hated
settlement
the
heretofore
orderly
ranks
showed
a
disposition
to
depart
from
the
steady
advance
and
rush
the

parker

did
in

break
away
and
set

sharp
pace
up

slope

tried
to
call
them
back
what
the
use
your
gettin
killed
he
shouted
why
not
answered
lige
who
like
the
others
was
increasing
his
speed
when
old
wimby
rose
up
suddenly
from
the
roadside
ahead
of
them
and
motioned
them
frantically
to
go
back
they
laid
out
along
the
fence
waitin

warned
them

spread
then
as
suddenly
as
he
had
appeared
he
dropped
down
into
the
weeds
again
lige
and
those
with
him
paused
and
the
whole
body
came
to
a
halt
while
the
leaders
consulted
there
was
a
sound
of
metallic
clicking
and
a
thin
rattle
of
steel
from
far
to
the
rear
came
the
voice
of
old
wilkerson

a
few
near

as
they
stood
waiting
began
to
take
up
the
burden
of
the
song
singing
in
slow
time
like
a
dirge
then
those
further
away
took
it
up
it
spread
reached
the
leaders
they
too
began
to
sing
taking
off
their
hats
as
they
joined
in
and
soon
the
whole
concourse
solemn
earnest
and
uncovered
was
singing
a
thunderous
requiem
for
john
harkless
the
sun
was
swinging
lower
and
the
edges
of
the
world
were
embroidered
with
gold
while
that
deep
volume
of
sound
shook
the
air
the
song
of
a
stern
savage
just
cause
sung
perhaps
as
some
of
the
ancestors
of
these
men
sang
with
hampden
before
the
bristling
walls
of
a
hostile
city
it
had
iron
and
steel
in
it
the
men
lying
on
their
guns
in
the
ambuscade
along
the
fence
heard
the
dirge
rise
and
grow
to
its
mighty
fulness
and
they
shivered
one
of
them
posted
nearest
the
advance
had
his
rifle
carefully
levelled
at
lige
willetts
a
fair
target
in
the
road
when
he
heard
the
singing
he
turned
to
the
man
next
behind
him
and
laughed
harshly
i
reckon
we
see
a
big
jamboree
in
hell
huh
the
huge
murmur
of
the
chorus
expanded
and
gathered
in
rhythmic
strength
and
swelled
to
power
and
rolled
and
thundered
across
the
plain
john
brown
body
lies
in
the
ground
john
brown
body
lies
in
the
ground
john
brown
body
lies
in
the
ground
his
soul
goes
marching
on
glory
glory
hallelujah
glory
glory
hallelujah
glory
glory
hallelujah
his
soul
goes
marching
on
a
gun
spat
from
the
higher
ground
and
willetts
dropped
where
he
stood
but
was
up
again
in
a
second
with
a
red
line
across
his
forehead
where
the
ball
had
grazed
his
temple
then
the
mob
spread
out
like
a
fan
hundreds
of
men
climbing
the
fence
and
beginning
the
advance
through
the
fields
dosing
on
the
ambuscade
from
both
sides
watts
wading
through
the
high
grass
in
the
field
north
of
the
road
perceived
the
barrel
of
a
gun
shining
from
a
bush
some
distance
in
front
of
him
and
although
in
the
same
second
no
weapon
was
seen
in
his
hand
discharged
a
revolver
at
the
bush
behind
the
gun
instantly
ten
or
twelve
men
leaped
from
their
along
the
fences
of
both
fields
and
firing
hurriedly
and
harmlessly
into
the
scattered
ranks
of
the
oncoming
mob
broke
for
the
shelter
of
the
houses
where
their
fellows
were
posted
taken
on
the
flanks
and
from
the
rear
there
was
but
one
thing
for
them
to
do
to
keep
from
being
hemmed
in
and
shot
or
captured
they
excessively
preferred
being
shot
with
a
wild
high
joyous
yell
sounding
like
the
bay
of
young
hounds
breaking
into
view
of
their
quarry
the
plattville
men
followed
the
most
eastward
of
the
debilitated
edifices
of
was
the
saloon
which
bore
the
painted
legends
on
the
west
wall
last
chance
on
the
east
wall
first
next
to
this
and
separated
by
two
or
three
acres
of
weedy
vacancy
from
the
corners
where
the
population
centred
thickest
one
may
so
predicate
of
a
building
which
leaned
in
seven
house
of
robert
skillett
the
proprietor
of
the
saloon
both
buildings
were
shut
up
as
tight
as
their
state
of
repair
permitted
as
they
were
furthest
to
the
east
they
formed
the
nearest
shelter
and
to
them
the
bent
their
flight
though
they
stopped
not
here
but
disappeared
behind
shanty
putting
it
between
them
and
their
pursuers
whose
guns
were
beginning
to
speak
the
fugitives
had
a
good
start
and
being
the
picked
runners
of
the
they
crossed
the
open
weedy
acres
in
safety
and
made
for
their
homes
every
house
had
become
a
fort
and
the
defenders
would
have
to
be
fought
and
torn
out
one
by
one
as
the
guns
sounded
a
woman
in
a
shanty
near
the
forge
began
to
scream
and
kept
on
screaming
on
came
the
farmers
and
the
men
of
plattville
they
took
the
saloon
at
a
run
battered
down
the
crazy
doors
with
a
and
swarmed
inside
like
busy
insects
making
the
place
hum
like
a
hive
but
with
the
hotter
industries
of
destruction
it
was
empty
of
life
as
a
tomb
but
they
beat
and
tore
and
battered
and
broke
and
hammered
and
shattered
like
madmen
they
reduced
the
tawdry
interior
to
a
mere
chaos
and
came
pouring
forth
laden
with
trophies
of
ruin
and
then
there
was
a
charry
smell
in
the
air
and
a
slender
feather
of
smoke
floated
up
from
a
window
at
the
same
time
watts
led
an
assault
on
the
adjoining
house
an
assault
which
came
to
a
sudden
pause
for
from
cracks
in
the
front
wall
a
and
a
snapped
and
banged
and
the
crowd
fell
back
in
disorder
homer
tibbs
had
a
hat
blown
away
full
of
holes
while
watts
solicitously
examined
a
small
aperture
in
the
skirts
of
his
brown
coat
the
house
commanded
the
road
and
the
rush
of
the
mob
into
the
village
was
checked
but
only
for
the
instant
a
rickety
woodshed
which
formed
a
portion
of
the
skillett
mansion
closely
joined
the
last
chance
side
of
the
family
place
of
business
scarcely
had
the
guns
of
the
defenders
sounded
when
with
a
loud
shout
lige
willetts
leaped
from
an
upper
window
on
that
side
of
the
burning
saloon
and
landed
on
the
woodshed
and
immediately
climbing
the
roof
of
the
house
itself
applied
a
fiery
brand
to
the
clapboards
ross
schofield
dropped
on
the
shed
close
behind
him
his
arm
lovingly
enfolding
a
gallon
jug
of
whiskey
which
he
emptied
not
without
evident
regret
upon
the
clapboards
as
lige
fired
them
flames
burst
forth
almost
instantly
and
the
smoke
uniting
with
that
now
rolling
out
of
every
window
of
the
saloon
went
up
to
heaven
in
a
cumbrous
gray
column
as
the
flames
began
to
spread
there
was
a
rapid
fusillade
from
the
rear
of
the
house
and
a
hundred
men
and
more
who
had
kept
on
through
the
fields
to
the
north
assailed
it
from
behind
their
shots
passed
clear
through
the
flimsy
partitions
and
there
was
a
horrid
screeching
like
a
beast
howls
from
within
the
front
door
was
thrown
open
and
a
lean
girl
with
a
in
her
hand
ran
out
in
the
face
of
the
mob
at
sound
of
the
shots
in
the
rear
they
had
begun
to
advance
on
the
house
a
second
time
and
hartley
bowlder
was
the
nearest
man
to
the
girl
with
awful
words
and
shrieking
inconceivably
she
made
straight
at
hartley
and
attacked
him
with
the
knife
she
struck
at
him
again
and
again
and
in
her
anguish
of
hate
and
fear
was
so
extraordinary
a
spectacle
that
she
gained
for
her
companions
the
four
or
five
seconds
they
needed
to
escape
from
the
house
as
she
hurled
herself
alone
at
the
oncoming
torrent
they
sped
from
the
door
unnoticed
sprang
over
the
fence
and
reached
the
open
lots
to
the
west
before
they
were
seen
by
willetts
from
the
roof
do
let
fool
you
he
shouted
look
to
i
your
left
there
they
go
do
let
get
the
were
running
across
the
field
they
were
bob
skillett
and
his
younger
brother
and
skillett
was
badly
damaged
he
seemed
to
be
holding
his
jaw
on
his
face
with
both
hands
the
girl
turned
and
sped
after
them
she
was
over
the
fence
almost
as
soon
as
they
were
and
the
three
ran
in
single
file
the
girl
last
she
was
either
magnificently
sacrificial
and
fearless
or
she
cunningly
calculated
that
the
regulators
would
take
no
chances
of
killing
a
for
she
kept
between
their
guns
and
her
two
companions
trying
to
cover
and
shield
the
latter
with
her
frail
body
shoot
lige
called
watts
if
we
fire
from
here
we
hit
the
girl
shoot
willetts
and
ross
schofield
were
still
standing
on
the
roof
at
the
edge
out
of
the
smoke
and
both
fired
at
the
same
time
the
fugitives
did
not
turn
they
kept
on
running
and
they
had
nearly
reached
the
other
side
of
the
field
when
suddenly
without
any
premonitory
gesture
the
elder
skillett
dropped
flat
on
his
face
the
stood
by
each
other
that
day
for
four
or
five
men
ran
out
of
the
nearest
shanty
into
the
open
lifted
the
prostrate
figure
from
the
ground
and
began
to
carry
it
back
with
them
but
skillett
was
alive
his
curses
were
heard
above
all
other
sounds
lige
and
schofield
fired
again
and
one
of
the
rescuers
staggered
nevertheless
as
the
two
men
slid
down
from
the
roof
the
burdened
were
seen
to
break
into
a
run
and
at
that
with
another
yell
fiercer
wilder
more
joyous
than
the
first
the
plattville
men
followed
the
yell
rang
loudly
in
the
ears
of
old
wilkerson
who
had
remained
back
in
the
road
and
at
the
same
instant
he
heard
another
shout
behind
him
wilkerson
had
not
shared
in
the
attack
but
greatly
preoccupied
with
his
own
histrionic
affairs
was
proceeding
up
the
pike
alone
except
for
the
unhappy
yellow
mongrel
still
dragged
along
by
the
and
alternating
as
was
his
natural
wont
from
one
fence
to
the
other
crouching
behind
every
bush
to
fire
an
imaginary
rifle
at
his
dog
and
then
springing
out
with
triumphant
bellowings
to
fall
prone
upon
the
terrified
animal
it
was
after
one
of
these
victories
that
a
shout
of
warning
was
raised
behind
him
and
wilkerson
by
grace
of
the
god
bacchus
rolling
out
of
the
way
in
time
to
save
his
life
saw
a
horse
dash
by
him
a
big
black
horse
whose
polished
flanks
were
dripping
with
lather
warren
smith
was
the
rider
he
was
waving
a
slip
of
yellow
paper
high
in
the
air
he
rode
up
the
slope
and
drew
rein
beyond
the
burning
buildings
just
ahead
of
those
foremost
in
the
pursuit
he
threw
his
horse
across
the
road
to
oppose
their
progress
rose
in
his
stirrups
and
waved
the
paper
over
his
head
stop
he
roared
give
me
one
minute
stop
he
had
a
grand
voice
and
he
was
known
in
many
parts
of
the
state
for
the
great
bass
roar
with
which
he
startled
his
juries
to
be
heard
at
a
distance
most
men
lift
the
pitch
of
their
voices
smith
lowered
his
an
octave
or
two
and
the
result
was
like
an
earthquake
playing
an
organ
in
a
catacomb
stop
he
thundered
stop
in
answer
one
of
the
flying
turned
and
sent
a
bullet
whistling
close
to
him
the
lawyer
paused
long
enough
to
bow
deeply
in
satirical
response
then
flourishing
the
paper
he
roared
again
stop
a
mistake
i
have
news
stop
i
say
homer
has
got
them
to
make
himself
heard
over
that
tempestuous
advance
was
a
feat
for
him
moreover
whose
counsels
had
so
lately
been
derided
to
interest
the
pursuers
at
such
a
moment
enough
to
make
them
listen
to
find
the
word
was
a
greater
and
by
the
word
and
by
gestures
at
once
vehemently
imperious
and
imploring
to
stop
them
was
still
greater
but
he
did
it
he
had
come
at
just
the
moment
before
the
moment
that
would
have
been
too
late
they
all
heard
him
they
all
knew
too
he
was
not
trying
to
save
the
as
a
matter
of
duty
because
he
had
given
that
up
before
the
mob
left
plattville
indeed
it
was
a
question
if
at
the
last
he
had
not
tacitly
approved
and
no
one
feared
indictments
for
the
day
work
it
would
do
no
harm
to
listen
to
what
he
had
to
say
the
work
could
wait
it
would
keep
for
five
minutes
they
began
to
gather
around
him
excited
flushed
perspiring
and
smelling
of
smoke
hartley
bowlder
won
by
lige
desperation
and
intrepidity
was
helping
the
latter
tie
up
his
head
no
one
else
was
hurt
what
is
it
they
clamored
impatiently
speak
quick
there
was
another
harmless
shot
from
a
fugitive
and
then
the
divining
that
the
diversion
was
in
their
favor
secured
themselves
in
their
decrepit
fastnesses
and
held
their
fire
meanwhile
the
flames
crackled
cheerfully
in
plattville
ears
no
matter
what
the
prosecutor
had
to
say
at
least
the
skillett
saloon
and
homestead
were
gone
and
bob
skillett
and
one
other
would
be
sick
enough
to
be
good
for
a
while

cried
warren
smith
and
rising
in
his
stirrups
again
read
the
missive
in
his

at

it
all
a
mistake
boys
the
lawyer
said
as
he
handed
the
paper
to
watts
and
parker
for
inspection
the
ladies
at
the
were
mistaken
that
all
and
this
proves
it
it
easy
enough
to
understand
they
were
frightened
by
the
storm
and
watching
a
fence
a
away
by
flashes
of
lightning
any
one
would
have
been
confused
and
imagined
all
the
horrors
on
earth
i
do
deny
but
what
i
believed
it
for
a
while
and
i
do
deny
but
the
is
pretty
tough
but
you
done
a
good
deal
here
already
and
saved
in
time
from
a
mistake
that
would
have
turned
out
mighty
bad
this
settles
it
homer
got
a
wire
from
rouen
to
come
over
there
soon
as
they
got
track
of
the
first
man
that
was
when
we
saw
him
on
the
rouen
a
slightly
cracked
voice
yet
a
huskily
tuneful
one
was
lifted
quaveringly
on
the
air
from
the
roadside
where
an
old
man
and
a
yellow
dog
sat
in
the
dust
together
the
latter
reprieved
at
the
last
moment
his
surprised
head
rakishly
garnished
with
a
hasty
wreath
of
daisies

the

of

they
knew
not
how
guilty
knowing
nothing
of
the
fantastic
pendulum
of
opinion
which
swung
by
the
events
of
the
day
had
marked
the
fatal
moment
of
guilt
now
on
others
now
on
them
who
deserved
it
these
natives
and
refugees
conscious
of
atrocity
dumfounded
by
a
miracle
thinking
the
world
gone
mad
hovered
together
in
a
dark
ragged
mass
at
the
crossing
corners
while
the
skeleton
of
the
rotting
buggy
in
the
slough
rose
behind

against
the
face
of

west
they
peered
with
stupified
eyes
through

faintly
through

mournfully
to

chapter
xii
jerry
the
teller
at
midnight
a
small
brougham
stopped
at
the
gates
of
the
city
hospital
in
rouen
a
short
distance
ahead
the
lamps
of
a
cab
drawn
up
at
the
curbing
made
two
dull
orange
sparks
under
the
electric
light
swinging
over
the
street
a
cigarette
described
a
brief
parabola
as
it
was
tossed
from
the
brougham
and
a
short
young
man
jumped
out
and
entered
the
gates
then
paused
and
spoke
to
the
driver
of
the
cab
did
you
bring
barrett
here
yes
sir
answered
the
driver
him
and
two
other
lighting
another
cigarette
from
which
he
drew
but
two
inspirations
before
he
threw
it
away
the
young
man
proceeded
quickly
up
the
walk
as
he
ascended
the
short
flight
of
steps
which
led
to
the
main
doors
he
panted
a
little
in
a
way
which
suggested
that
although
his
white
waistcoat
outlined
an
ellipse
still
respectable
a
crescendo
of
portliness
was
playing
diminuendo
with
his
youth
and
though
his
walk
was
brisk
it
was
not
lively
the
expression
of
his
very
red
face
indicated
that
his
briskness
was
spurred
by
anxiety
and
a
fattish
groan
he
emitted
on
the
top
step
added
the
impression
that
his
comfortable
body
protested
against
the
mental
spur
in
the
hall
he
removed
his
straw
hat
and
presented
a
rotund
and
amiable
head
from
the
top
of
which
his
auburn
hair
seemed
to
retire
with
a
sense
of
defeat
it
fell
back
however
not
in
confusion
but
in
perfect
order
and
the
sparse
pink
mist
left
upon
his
crown
gave
by
a
supreme
effort
an
effect
of
arrangement
so
that
an
imaginative
observer
would
have
declared
that
there
was
a
part
down
the
middle
the
gentleman
plump
face
bore
a
grave
and
troubled
expression
and
gravity
and
trouble
were
patent
in
all
the
lines
of
his
figure
and
in
every
gesture
in
the
way
he
turned
his
head
in
the
uneasy
shifting
of
his
hat
from
one
hand
to
the
other
and
in
his
fanning
himself
with
it
in
a
nervous
fashion
and
in
his
small
blue
eyes
which
did
not
twinkle
behind
his
rimless
glasses
and
looked
unused
to
not
twinkling
his
gravity
clothed
him
like
an
coat
or
possibly
he
might
have
reminded
the
imaginative
observer
just
now
conjured
up
of
a
set
to
turning
its
cylinder
backwards
he
spoke
to
an
attendant
and
was
directed
to
an
office
which
he
entered
without
delay
there
were
five
men
in
the
room
three
of
them
engaged
in
conversation
near
the
door
another
a
young
surgeon
was
writing
at
a
desk
the
fifth
drowsily
nodding
on
a
sofa
the
newcomer
bowed
as
he
entered
mr
barrett
he
said
inquiringly
one
of
the
men
near
the
door
turned
about
yes
sir
he
answered
with
a
stem
disfavor
of
the
applicant
a
disfavor
possibly
a
perquisite
of
his
office
what
wanted
i
think
i
have
met
you
returned
the
other
my
name
is
barrett
probably
did
not
locate
the
meeting
but
the
name
proved
an
open
sesame
to
his
geniality
for
he
melted
at
once
and
saying
of
course
of
course
meredith
did
you
want
a
talk
with
me
clasped
the
young
man
hand
confidentially
in
his
and
with
an
appearance
of
assuring
him
that
whatever
the
atrocity
which
had
occurred
in
the
meredith
household
it
should
be
discreetly
handled
and
hushed
up
indicated
a
disposition
to
conduct
him
toward
a
more
appropriate
apartment
for
the
rehearsal
of
scandal
the
young
man
accepted
the
with
some
resignation
but
rejected
the
suggestion
of
privacy
a
telegram
from
plattville
reached
me
half
an
hour
ago
he
said
i
should
have
had
it
sooner
but
i
have
been
in
the
country
all
the
two
men
who
had
been
talking
with
the
superintendent
turned
quickly
and
stared
at
the
speaker
he
went
on
mr
harkless
was
an
old
and
he
broke
off
with
a
sudden
sharp
choking
and
for
a
moment
was
unable
to
control
an
emotion
that
seemed
for
some
reason
as
surprising
and
unbefitting
in
a
person
of
his
rubicund
presence
as
was
his
gravity
an
astonished
tear
glittered
in
the
corner
of
his
eye
the
grief
of
the
gayer
sorts
of
stout
people
appears
sometimes
to
dumfound
even
themselves
the
young
man
took
off
his
glasses
and
wiped
them
slowly
an
old
and
very
dear
friend
of
he
replaced
the
glasses
insecurely
upon
his
nose
i
telephoned
to
your
headquarters
and
they
said
you
had
come
yes
sir
yes
sir
the
superintendent
of
police
responded
cheerfully
these
two
gentlemen
are
from
plattville
smith
just
got
in
they
mighty
near
had
big
trouble
down
there
but
i
guess
we
settle
things
for
up
here
let
me
make
you
acquainted
with
my
friend
smith
and
my
friend
homer
gentlemen
my
friend
meredith
one
of
our
you
hear
it
from
the
police
gentlemen
added
meredith
perking
up
a
little
i
know
he
nodded
to
the
surgeon
i
suppose
you
have
heard
some
of
the
circumstances
those
that
given
out
said
barrett
i
read
the
account
in
the
evening
paper
i
had
heard
of
harkless
of
carlow
before
but
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
it
was
my
friend
i
had
heard
he
was
abroad
until
i
got
this
telegram
from
a
relative
of
mine
who
happened
to
be
down
well
said
the
superintendent
your
friend
made
a
mighty
good
fight
before
he
gave
up
the
teller
that
the
man
we
got
out
here
so
hacked
up
and
shot
and
battered
his
mother
would
know
him
if
she
wanted
to
at
least
that
what
gay
here
says
we
have
seen
him
because
the
doctors
have
been
at
him
ever
since
he
was
found
and
they
expect
to
do
some
more
tonight
when
we
had
our
interview
with
him
if
he
lives
long
enough
one
of
my
sergeants
found
him
in
the
about
and
sent
him
here
in
the
ambulance
knew
it
was
teller
because
he
was
stowed
away
in
one
of
the
empty
cars
that
came
from
plattville
last
night
and
slattery
that
his
running
mate
the
one
we
caught
with
the
coat
and
hat
gave
in
that
they
beat
their
way
on
that
freight
i
guess
slattery
let
this
one
do
most
of
the
fighting
he
ai
scratched
but
harkless
certainly
made
it
hot
for
the
my
relative
believes
that
harkless
is
still
alive
said
meredith
barrett
permitted
himself
an
indulgent
smile
he
had
the
air
of
having
long
ago
discovered
everything
which
anybody
might
wish
to
know
and
of
knowing
a
great
deal
which
he
held
in
reserve
because
it
was
necessary
to
suppress
many
facts
for
a
purpose
far
beyond
his
comprehension
though
a
very
simple
matter
to
himself
well
hardly
i
expect
he
replied
easily
no
he
hardly
oh
do
say
that
said
meredith
i
afraid
barrett
has
to
say
it
broke
in
warren
smith
we
up
here
to
see
this
fellow
before
he
dies
to
try
and
get
him
to
tell
what
disposal
they
made
of
the
ah
meredith
shivered
i
believe
i
rather
he
said
the
other
than
to
hear
you
say
horner
felt
the
need
of
defending
a
and
came
to
the
rescue
flushing
painfully
it
mighty
bad
i
know
said
the
sheriff
of
carlow
the
shadows
of
his
honest
rough
face
falling
in
a
solemn
pattern
i
reckon
we
hate
to
say
it
as
much
as
you
hate
to
hear
it
and
warren
really
did
get
the
word
out
it
stuck
in
our
throats
all
day
and
i
do
recollect
as
i
heard
a
single
man
say
it
before
i
left
our
city
this
morning
our
folks
thought
a
great
deal
of
him
meredith
i
do
believe
there
any
thinks
more
but
it
come
to
that
now
you
ca
hardly
see
no
chance
left
we
sweating
this
other
man
slattery
but
we
ca
break
him
down
jest
tells
us
to
go
to
the
sheriff
paused
evidently
deterred
by
the
thought
that
were
unbefitting
a
hospital
to
the
other
place
and
shets
his
jaw
up
tight
the
one
up
here
is
called
the
teller
as
barrett
says
his
jerry
the
teller
well
we
told
slattery
that
jerry
had
died
and
left
a
confession
tried
to
make
him
think
there
was
no
hope
fer
him
and
he
might
as
well
up
and
tell
his
share
might
git
off
easier
warned
him
to
look
out
for
a
mob
if
he
did
maybe
and
so
on
but
it
never
bothered
him
at
all
he
nervy
all
right
told
us
to
go
that
is
he
said
it
again
and
swore
the
teller
was
on
his
way
to
chicago
swore
he
seen
him
git
on
the
train
would
say
another
word
tell
he
got
a
lawyer
so
as
it
was
any
use
we
come
up
here
they
reckon
he
come
to
before
he
dies
we
be
glad
to
have
you
go
in
with
us
horner
said
kindly
i
reckon
it
all
the
same
to
he
will
die
will
he
gay
meredith
asked
turning
to
the
surgeon
oh
not
necessarily
the
young
man
replied
yawning
slightly
behind
his
hand
and
too
long
accustomed
to
straightforward
questions
to
be
shocked
at
an
evident
wish
for
a
direct
reply
his
chances
are
better
because
they
hang
him
if
he
gets
well
they
took
the
ball
and
a
good
deal
of
shot
out
of
his
side
and
there
a
lot
more
for
afterwhile
if
he
lasts
he
been
off
the
table
an
hour
and
he
still
that
in
his
favor
is
it
said
meredith
and
extraordinary
too
if
young
dr
gay
perceived
a
slur
in
these
interrogations
he
betrayed
no
exterior
appreciation
of
it
shot
exclaimed
homer
shot
i
knowed
there
a
pistol
used
though
where
they
got
it
beats
me
we
stripped
and
it
was
harkless
he
never
carried
one
but
a
an
attendant
entered
and
spoke
to
the
surgeon
and
gay
rose
wearily
touched
the
drowsy
young
man
on
the
shoulder
and
led
the
way
to
the
door
you
can
come
now
he
said
to
the
others
though
i
doubt
its
being
any
good
to
you
he
they
went
down
a
long
hall
and
up
a
narrow
corridor
then
stepped
softly
into
a
small
quiet
ward
there
was
a
pungent
smell
of
chemicals
in
the
room
the
light
was
low
and
the
dimness
was
imbued
with
a
thick
confused
murmur
incoherent
whisperings
that
came
from
a
cot
in
the
corner
it
was
the
only
cot
in
use
in
the
ward
and
meredith
was
conscious
of
a
terror
that
made
him
dread
to
look
at
it
to
go
near
it
beside
it
a
nurse
sat
silent
and
upon
it
feebly
tossed
the
racked
body
of
him
whom
barrett
had
called
jerry
the
teller
the
head
was
a
shapeless
bundle
so
swathed
it
was
with
bandages
and
cloths
and
what
part
of
the
face
was
visible
was
discolored
and
pigmented
with
drugs
stretched
under
the
white
sheet
the
man
looked
immensely
tall
as
horner
saw
with
vague
misgiving
and
he
lay
in
an
odd
inhuman
fashion
as
though
he
had
been
all
broken
to
pieces
his
attempts
to
move
were
constantly
soothed
by
the
nurse
and
he
as
constantly
renewed
such
attempts
and
one
hand
though
torn
and
bandaged
was
not
to
be
restrained
from
a
wandering
restless
movement
which
meredith
felt
to
be
pathetic
he
had
entered
the
room
with
a
flare
of
hate
for
the
thug
whom
he
had
come
to
see
die
and
who
had
struck
down
the
old
friend
whose
nearness
he
had
never
known
until
it
was
too
late
but
at
first
sight
of
the
broken
figure
he
felt
all
animosity
fall
away
from
him
only
awe
remained
and
a
growing
traitorous
pity
as
he
watched
the
long
white
fingers
of
the
teller
pick
at
the
the
man
was
muttering
rapid
fragments
of
words
and
syllables
somehow
i
feel
a
sense
of
wrong
meredith
whispered
to
gay
i
feel
as
if
i
had
done
the
fellow
to
death
myself
as
if
it
were
all
out
of
gear
i
know
now
how
henry
felt
over
the
great
guisard
my
god
how
tall
he
looks
that
does
seem
to
me
like
a
thug
the
surgeon
nodded
of
course
if
there
a
mistake
to
be
made
you
can
count
on
barrett
and
his
sergeants
to
make
it
i
doubt
if
this
is
their
man
when
they
found
him
what
clothes
he
wore
were
torn
and
stained
but
they
had
been
good
once
especially
the
barrett
bent
over
the
recumbent
figure
see
here
jerry
he
said
i
want
to
talk
to
you
a
little
rouse
up
will
you
i
want
to
talk
to
you
as
a
the
incoherent
muttering
continued
see
here
jerry
repeated
barrett
more
sharply
jerry
rouse
up
will
you
we
do
want
any
fooling
understand
that
jerry
he
dropped
his
hand
on
the
man
shoulder
and
shook
him
slightly
the
teller
uttered
a
short
gasping
cry
let
me
said
gay
and
swiftly
interposed
bending
over
the
cot
he
said
in
a
pleasant
soft
voice
it
all
right
old
man
it
all
right
slattery
wants
to
know
what
you
did
with
that
man
down
at
plattville
when
you
got
through
with
him
he
ca
remember
and
he
thinks
there
was
money
left
on
him
slattery
head
was
hurt
he
remember
he
go
shares
with
you
when
he
gets
it
slattery
going
to
stand
by
you
if
he
can
get
the
the
teller
only
tried
to
move
his
free
hand
to
the
shoulder
barrett
had
shaken
slattery
wants
to
know
repeated
the
surgeon
gently
moving
the
hand
back
upon
the
sheet
he
divvy
up
when
he
gets
it
he
stand
by
you
old
would
you
please
not
mind
whispered
the
teller
faintly
would
you
please
not
mind
if
you
took
care
not
to
brush
against
my
shoulder
again
the
surgeon
drew
back
with
an
exclamation
but
the
teller
whisper
gathered
strength
and
they
heard
him
murmuring
oddly
to
himself
meredith
moved
forward
what
that
he
asked
with
a
startled
gesture
seems
to
be
trying
to
sing
or
something
said
barrett
bending
over
to
listen
the
teller
swung
his
arm
heavily
over
the
side
of
the
cot
the
fingers
never
ceasing
their
painful
twitching
and
gay
leaned
down
and
gently
moved
the
cloths
so
that
the
white
scarred
lips
were
free
they
moved
steadily
they
seemed
to
be
framing
the
semblance
of
an
old
ballad
that
meredith
knew
the
whisper
grew
more
distinct
and
it
became
a
rich
but
broken
voice
and
they
heard
it
singing
like
the
sound
of
some
far
halting
minstrelsy
wave
willows
murmur
waters
golden
sunbeams
smile
earthly
music
can
not
waken
lovely
annie
my
god
cried
tom
meredith
the
bandaged
hand
waved
jauntily
over
the
teller
head
ah
men
he
said
almost
clearly
and
tried
to
lift
himself
on
his
arm
i
tell
you
it
a
grand
eleven
we
have
this
year
there
will
be
little
left
of
anything
that
stands
against
them
did
you
see
jim
romley
ride
over
his
man
this
afternoon
as
the
voice
grew
clearer
the
sheriff
stepped
forward
but
tom
meredith
with
a
loud
exclamation
of
grief
threw
himself
on
his
knees
beside
the
cot
and
seized
the
wandering
fingers
in
his
own
john
he
cried
john
is
it
the
voice
went
on
rapidly
not
heeding
him
ah
you
need
howl
have
been
as
much
use
at
right
as
that
sophomore
well
laugh
away
you
indians
if
it
had
been
for
this
ankle
but
it
seems
to
be
my
chest
that
hurt
and
side
not
that
it
matters
you
know
the
just
as
good
or
better
it
only
my
egotism
yes
it
must
be
the
side
and
chest
and
head
all
over
i
believe
not
that
it
matters
i
try
again
next
year
next
year
i
make
it
a
daily
helen
said
not
that
i
should
call
you
helen
i
mean
miss
miss
fisbee
no
sherwood
but
i
always
thought
helen

the
prettiest
name
in
the
world
you

me
and
please
tell
parker
there

more
copy
and
wo

never

a
good
trade
no
they
ca
come
seven
miles
but
i
finish
skillett
first
i
know
i
know
nearly
all
of
you
now
let
sing
lisle
he
lifted
his
hand
as
if
to
beat
the
time
for
a
chorus
oh
john
john
cried
tom
meredith
and
sobbed
outright
my
boy
my
boy
old
friend
the
cry
of
the
classmate
was
like
that
of
a
mother
for
it
was
his
old
idol
and
hero
who
lay
helpless
and
broken
before
him
the
brougham
lamps
and
the
apathetic
sparks
of
the
cab
gleamed
in
front
of
the
hospital
till
daylight
two
other
pairs
of
lamps
joined
them
in
the
earliest
of
the
small
hours
these
subjoined
to
two
phaetons
from
each
of
which
quickly
descended
a
gentleman
with
a
beard
an
air
of
eminence
and
a
small
ominous
black
box
the
air
of
eminence
was
justified
by
the
haste
with
which
meredith
had
sent
for
them
and
by
their
wide
repute
they
arrived
almost
simultaneously
and
hastily
shook
hands
as
they
made
their
way
to
the
ward
down
the
long
hall
and
up
the
narrow
corridor
they
had
a
short
conversation
with
gay
and
a
word
with
the
nurse
then
turned
the
others
out
of
the
room
by
a
practiced
innuendo
of
manner
they
stayed
a
long
time
in
the
room
without
opening
the
door
meredith
paced
the
hall
alone
sometimes
stopping
to
speak
to
warren
smith
but
the
two
officials
of
peace
sat
together
in
dumb
consternation
and
astonishment
the
sleepy
young
man
relaxed
himself
resignedly
upon
a
bench
in
the
hall
had
returned
to
the
dormance
from
which
he
had
been
roused
the
big
hospital
was
very
still
now
and
then
a
nurse
went
through
the
hall
carrying
something
and
sometimes
a
neat
young
physician
passed
cheerfully
along
looking
as
if
he
had
many
patients
who
were
well
enough
to
testify
to
his
skill
but
sick
enough
to
pay
for
it
outside
through
the
open
front
doors
the
crickets
chirped
meredith
went
out
on
the
steps
and
breathed
the
cool
night
air
a
slender
taint
of
drugs
hung
everywhere
about
the
building
and
the
almost
imperceptible
permeation
sickened
him
it
was
deadly
he
thought
and
imbued
with
a
hideous
portent
of
suffering
that
john
harkless
of
all
men
should
lie
stifled
with
ether
and
bandaged
and
splintered
and
smeared
with
horrible
unguents
while
they
stabbed
and
slashed
and
tortured
him
and
made
an
outrage
and
a
sin
of
that
grand
big
dexterous
body
of
his
meredith
shuddered
the
lights
in
the
little
ward
were
turned
up
and
they
seemed
to
shine
from
a
chamber
of
horrors
while
he
waited
as
a
brother
might
have
waited
outside
the
inquisition
if
indeed
a
brother
would
have
been
allowed
to
wait
outside
the
inquisition
alas
he
had
found
john
harkless
he
had
lost
track
of
him
as
men
sometimes
do
lose
track
of
their
best
beloved
but
it
had
always
been
a
comfort
to
know
that
harkless
somewhere
a
comfort
without
which
he
could
hardly
have
got
along
like
others
he
had
been
waiting
for
john
to
turn
up
on
top
of
course
for
people
would
always
believe
in
him
so
that
he
would
be
shoved
ahead
no
matter
how
much
he
hung
back
himself
but
meredith
had
not
expected
him
to
turn
up
in
indiana
he
had
heard
vaguely
that
harkless
was
abroad
and
he
had
a
general
expectation
that
people
would
hear
of
him
over
there
some
day
with
papers
like
the
times
beseeching
him
to
go
on
missions
and
he
found
him
here
in
his
own
home
a
stranger
alone
and
dying
receiving
what
ministrations
were
reserved
for
jerry
the
teller
but
it
was
helen
sherwood
who
had
found
him
he
wondered
how
much
those
two
had
seen
of
each
other
down
there
in
plattville
if
they
had
liked
each
other
and
harkless
could
have
lived
he
thought
it
might
have
simplified
some
things
for
helen
poor
helen
he
exclaimed
aloud
her
telegram
had
a
ring
even
in
the
barren
four
sentences
he
wondered
how
much
they
had
liked
each
other
perhaps
she
would
wish
to
come
at
once
when
those
fellows
came
out
of
the
room
he
would
send
her
a
word
by
telegraph
when
they
came
out
ah
he
did
not
want
them
to
come
out
he
was
afraid
they
were
an
eternity
why
did
they
come
no
he
hoped
they
would
not
come
just
now
in
a
little
time
in
a
few
minutes
even
he
would
not
dread
a
few
words
so
much
but
he
could
quite
bear
to
be
told
he
had
found
his
friend
only
to
lose
him
the
man
he
had
always
most
needed
wanted
loved
everybody
had
always
cared
for
harkless
wherever
he
went
that
had
always
cared
for
everybody
was
part
of
the
reason
maybe
meredith
remembered
now
hearing
a
man
who
had
spent
a
day
in
plattville
on
business
speak
of
him
they
got
a
young
fellow
down
there
who
be
governor
in
a
few
years
he
a
sort
of
dictator
and
runs
the
party
all
over
that
part
of
the
state
to
suit
his
own
sweet
will
just
by
sheer
personality
and
there
is
a
man
in
that
district
who
would
cheerfully
lie
down
in
the
mud
to
let
him
pass
over
dry
it
that
young
harkless
you
know
owns
the
the
paper
that
downed
mccune
and
smashed
those
imitation
in
carlow
meredith
had
been
momentarily
struck
by
the
coincidence
of
the
name
but
his
notion
of
harkless
was
so
inseparably
connected
with
what
was
to
his
mind
a
handsome
and
more
spacious
certainly
more
illuminated
field
of
action
that
the
idea
that
this
might
be
his
friend
never
entered
his
head
helen
had
said
something
once
he
could
not
remember
what
that
made
him
think
she
had
half
suspected
it
and
he
had
laughed
he
thought
of
the
whimsical
fate
that
had
taken
her
to
plattville
of
the
reason
for
her
going
and
the
old
thought
came
to
him
that
the
world
is
after
all
so
very
small
he
looked
up
at
the
twinkling
stars
they
were
reassuring
and
kind
under
their
benignancy
no
loss
could
befall
no
fate
miscarry
for
in
his
last
thought
he
felt
his
vision
opened
for
the
moment
to
perceive
a
fine
tracery
of
fate
ah
that
would
be
too
beautiful
he
said
and
then
he
shivered
for
his
name
was
spoken
from
within
it
was
soon
plain
to
him
that
he
need
not
have
feared
a
few
words
for
he
did
not
in
the
least
understand
those
with
which
the
eminent
surgeons
favored
him
and
they
at
once
took
their
departure
he
did
understand
however
what
horner
told
him
barrett
warren
smith
and
the
sleepy
young
man
had
reentered
the
ward
and
horner
was
following
but
waited
for
meredith
somehow
the
look
of
the
sheriff
sunday
coat
wrinkling
forlornly
from
his
broad
bent
shoulders
was
both
touching
and
solemn
he
said
simply
he
conscious
and
not
out
of
his
head
they
gone
in
to
take
his
statement
and
they
went
into
the
room
harkless
eyes
were
bandaged
the
lawyer
was
speaking
to
him
and
as
horner
went
awkwardly
toward
the
cot
warren
said
something
indicative
of
the
sheriff
presence
and
the
hand
on
the
sheet
made
a
formless
motion
which
horner
understood
for
he
took
the
pale
fingers
in
his
own
very
gently
and
then
set
them
back
smith
turned
toward
meredith
but
the
latter
made
a
gesture
which
forbade
the
attorney
to
speak
of
him
and
went
to
a
corner
and
sat
down
with
his
head
in
his
hands
the
sleepy
young
man
opened
a
notebook
and
shook
a
stylographic
pen
so
that
the
ink
might
flow
freely
the
lawyer
briefly
and
with
unlegal
agitation
administered
an
oath
to
which
harkless
responded
feebly
and
then
there
was
silence
now
harkless
if
you
please
said
barrett
insinuatingly
if
you
feel
like
telling
us
as
much
as
you
can
about
it
he
answered
in
a
low
rather
indistinct
voice
very
deliberately
pausing
before
almost
every
word
it
was
easy
work
for
the
sleepy
stenographer
i
understand
i
do
want
to
go
off
my
head
again
before
i
finish
of
course
i
know
why
you
want
this
if
it
were
only
for
myself
i
should
tell
you
nothing
because
if
i
am
to
leave
i
should
like
it
better
if
no
one
were
punished
but
that
a
bad
community
over
there
they
are
everlastingly
worrying
our
people
they
have
always
been
a
bother
to
us
and
it
time
it
was
stopped
for
good
i
do
believe
very
much
in
punishment
but
you
ca
do
a
great
deal
of
reforming
with
the
unless
you
catch
them
young
very
young
before
weaned
they
wean
them
on
whiskey
i
think
i
realize
you
need
have
sworn
me
for
me
to
tell
you
homer
and
smith
had
started
at
the
mention
of
the
but
they
subdued
their
ejaculations
while
barrett
looked
as
if
he
had
known
it
of
course
the
room
was
still
save
for
the
dim
voice
and
the
soft
transcribings
of
the
stylographic
pen
i
left
judge
briscoe
and
went
west
on
the
pike
to
a
big
tree
it
rained
and
i
stepped
under
the
tree
for
shelter
there
was
a
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
it
was
bob
skillett
he
was
carrying
his
gown
and
hood
i
suppose
it
was
that
on
his
arm
then
i
saw
two
others
a
little
farther
east
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
i
think
they
had
followed
me
from
the
briscoes
or
near
there
they
had
their
foolish
regalia
on
as
all
the
rest
had
there
was
plenty
of
lightning
to
see
the
two
in
the
road
were
simply
standing
there
in
the
rain
looking
at
me
through
the
in
their
hoods
i
knew
there
were
others
plenty
but
i
thought
they
were
coming
from
behind
me
the
west
i
wanted
to
get
home
the
yard
was
good
enough
for
me
so
i
started
east
toward
town
i
passed
the
two
gentlemen
and
one
fell
down
as
i
went
by
him
but
the
other
fired
a
shot
as
a
signal
and
i
got
his
hood
off
his
face
for
it
i
stopped
long
enough
and
it
was
force
johnson
i
know
him
well
then
i
ran
and
they
followed
a
little
ahead
of
me
i
saw
six
or
eight
of
them
spread
across
the
road
i
knew
i
have
a
time
getting
through
so
i
jumped
the
fence
to
cut
across
the
fields
and
i
lit
in
a
swarm
of
them
it
had
rained
them
just
where
i
jumped
i
set
my
back
to
the
fence
but
one
of
the
fellows
in
the
road
leaned
over
and
smashed
my
head
in
rather
with
the
butt
of
a
gun
i
believe
i
came
out
from
the
fence
and
they
made
a
little
circle
around
me
no
one
said
anything
i
saw
they
had
ropes
and
saplings
and
i
did
want
that
exactly
so
i
went
into
them
i
got
a
good
many
hoods
off
before
it
was
over
and
i
can
swear
to
quite
a
number
besides
those
i
told
he
named
the
men
slowly
and
carefully
then
he
went
on
i
think
they
gave
up
the
notion
of
whipping
we
all
got
into
a
bunch
and
they
could
clear
to
shoot
without
hitting
some
of
their
own
and
there
was
a
lot
of
gouging
and
kicking
one
fellow
nearly
got
my
left
eye
and
i
tried
to
tear
him
apart
and
he
screamed
so
that
i
think
he
was
hurt
once
or
twice
i
thought
i
might
get
away
but
somebody
hammered
me
over
the
head
and
face
again
and
i
got
dizzy
and
then
they
all
jumped
away
from
me
suddenly
and
bob
skillett
stepped
up
and
shot
me
he
waited
for
a
good
flurry
of
lightning
and
i
was
slow
tumbling
down
some
one
else
fired
a
i
think
i
ca
be
sure
about
the
same
time
from
the
side
i
tried
to
get
up
but
i
could
and
then
they
got
together
for
a
consultation
the
man
i
had
hurt
i
did
recognize
him
came
and
looked
at
me
he
was
nursing
himself
all
over
and
groaned
and
i
laughed
i
at
any
rate
my
arm
was
lying
stretched
out
on
the
grass
and
he
stamped
his
heel
into
my
hand
and
after
a
little
of
that
i
quit
feeling
i
not
quite
clear
about
what
happened
afterwards
they
went
away
not
far
i
think
there
an
old
shed
a
near
there
and
i
think
the
storm
drove
them
under
it
to
wait
for
a
slack
it
seemed
a
long
time
sometimes
i
was
conscious
sometimes
i
was
i
thought
i
might
be
drowned
but
i
suppose
the
rain
was
good
for
me
then
i
remember
being
in
motion
being
dragged
and
carried
a
long
way
they
took
me
up
a
steep
short
slope
and
set
me
down
near
the
top
i
knew
that
was
the
railroad
embankment
and
i
thought
they
meant
to
lay
me
across
the
track
but
it
did
occur
to
them
i
suppose
they
are
not
familiar
with
melodrama
and
a
long
time
after
that
i
felt
and
heard
a
great
banging
and
rattling
under
me
and
all
about
me
and
it
came
to
me
that
they
had
disposed
of
me
by
hoisting
me
into
an
empty
the
odd
part
of
it
was
that
the
car
was
empty
for
there
were
two
men
already
in
it
and
i
knew
them
by
what
they
said
to
me
they
were
the
two
who
cheated
hartley
bowlder
and
they
were
vindictive
they
even
seemed
to
be
trying
to
help
me
a
little
though
perhaps
they
were
only
stealing
my
clothes
and
maybe
they
thought
for
them
to
do
anything
unpleasant
would
be
superfluous
i
could
see
that
they
thought
i
was
done
for
and
that
they
had
been
hiding
in
the
car
when
i
was
put
there
i
asked
them
to
try
to
call
the
train
men
for
me
but
they
would
listen
or
else
i
could
make
myself
understood
that
all
the
rest
is
a
blur
i
have
known
anything
more
until
those
surgeons
were
here
please
tell
me
how
long
ago
it
happened
i
shall
not
die
i
think
there
are
a
good
many
things
i
want
to
know
he
moved
restlessly
and
the
nurse
soothed
him
meredith
rose
and
left
the
room
with
a
noiseless
step
he
went
out
to
the
stars
again
and
looked
to
them
to
check
the
storm
of
rage
and
sorrow
that
buffeted
his
bosom
he
understood
lynching
now
the
thing
was
home
to
him
and
his
feeling
was
no
inspiration
of
a
fear
lest
the
law
miscarry
it
was
the
itch
to
get
his
own
hand
on
the
rope
horner
came
out
presently
and
whispered
a
long
broad
profound
curse
upon
the
men
of
the
and
meredith
gratitude
to
him
was
keen
barrett
went
away
soon
after
leaving
the
cab
for
the
gentlemen
from
plattville
meredith
had
a
strange
unreasonable
desire
to
kick
barrett
possibly
for
his
sergeant
sake
warren
smith
sat
in
the
ward
with
the
nurse
and
gay
and
the
room
was
very
quiet
it
was
a
long
vigil
they
were
only
waiting
at
five
he
was
still
alive
just
that
smith
came
out
to
say
meredith
sent
his
driver
with
a
telegram
to
helen
which
would
give
plattville
the
news
that
harkless
was
found
and
was
not
yet
gone
from
them
homer
took
the
cab
and
left
for
the
station
there
was
a
train
and
there
were
things
for
him
to
do
in
carlow
at
noon
meredith
sent
a
second
telegram
to
helen
as
barren
of
detail
as
the
first
he
was
alive
was
a
little
improved
this
telegram
did
not
reach
her
for
she
was
on
the
way
to
rouen
and
half
of
the
population
of
carlow
at
least
so
it
appeared
to
the
unhappy
conductor
of
the
accommodation
was
with
her
they
seemed
to
feel
that
they
could
camp
in
the
hospital
halls
and
corridors
and
they
were
an
incalculable
worry
to
the
authorities
more
came
on
every
train
and
nearly
all
brought
flowers
and
jelly
and
chickens
for
preparing
broth
and
they
insisted
that
the
two
latter
delicacies
be
fed
to
the
patient
at
once
meredith
was
possessed
by
an
unaccountable
responsibility
for
them
all
and
invited
a
great
many
to
stay
at
his
own
house
they
were
still
in
ignorance
of
the
truth
about
the
and
some
of
them
spent
the
day
it
was
sunday
in
planning
an
assault
upon
the
rouen
jail
for
the
purpose
of
lynching
slattery
in
case
harkless
condition
did
not
improve
at
once
those
who
had
heard
his
statement
kept
close
mouths
until
the
story
appeared
in
full
in
the
rouen
papers
on
monday
morning
but
by
that
time
every
member
of
the
was
lodged
in
the
rouen
jail
with
slattery
homer
and
a
heavily
armed
posse
rode
over
to
the
muddy
corners
on
sunday
night
and
the
sheriff
discovered
that
he
might
have
taken
the
skilletts
and
johnsons
and
unarmed
their
nerve
was
gone
they
were
shaken
and
afraid
and
to
employ
a
figure
somewhat
inappropriate
to
their
sullen
glad
surrender
they
fell
upon
his
neck
in
their
relief
at
finding
the
law
touching
them
they
had
no
wish
to
hear
john
brown
body
again
they
wanted
to
get
inside
of
a
strong
jail
and
to
throw
themselves
on
the
mercy
of
the
court
as
soon
as
possible
and
those
whom
harkless
had
not
recognized
delayed
not
to
give
themselves
up
they
did
not
desire
to
remain
in
bob
skillett
force
johnson
and
one
or
two
others
needed
the
care
of
a
physician
badly
and
one
man
was
suffering
from
a
severely
wrenched
back
homer
had
a
train
stopped
at
a
crossing
so
that
his
prisoners
need
not
be
taken
through
plattville
and
he
brought
them
all
safely
to
rouen
had
there
chanced
any
one
to
ride
through
the
deserted
the
next
morning
passing
the
trampled
fields
and
the
charred
ruins
of
the
two
shanties
to
the
east
and
listening
to
the
lamentations
of
the
women
and
children
he
would
have
declared
that
at
last
the
old
score
had
been
paid
and
that
was
wiped
out
the
carlow
folks
were
deeply
impressed
with
the
two
eminent
surgeons
of
whom
some
of
them
had
heard
and
on
tuesday
the
bulletins
marking
considerable
encouragement
most
of
them
decided
to
temporarily
risk
the
editor
of
the
herald
to
such
capable
hands
and
they
returned
quietly
to
their
homes
only
a
few
were
delayed
in
reaching
carlow
by
travelling
to
the
first
station
in
the
opposite
direction
before
they
succeeded
in
planting
themselves
on
the
proper
train
meanwhile
the
object
of
their
solicitude
tossed
and
burned
on
his
bed
of
pain
he
was
delirious
most
of
the
time
and
in
the
intervals
of
found
that
his
desire
to
live
very
strong
at
first
had
disappeared
he
did
not
care
much
about
anything
except
rest
he
wanted
peace
in
his
wanderings
he
was
almost
always
back
in
his
college
days
beholding
them
in
an
unhappy
distorted
fashion
he
would
lie
asprawl
on
the
sward
with
the
others
listening
to
the
seniors
singing
on
the
steps
and
all
at
once
the
old
kindly
faces
would
expand
enormously
and
press
over
him
with
hideous
mouthings
and
an
ugly
senior
in
cap
and
gown
would
stamp
him
and
grind
a
spiked
heel
into
his
hand
then
they
would
toss
him
high
into
air
that
was
all
flames
and
he
would
fall
and
fall
through
the
raging
heat
seeing
the
cool
earth
far
beneath
him
but
never
able
to
get
down
to
it
again
and
then
he
was
driven
miles
and
miles
by
dusky
figures
through
a
rain
of
boiling
water
and
at
other
times
the
whole
universe
was
a
vast
hot
brass
bell
and
it
gave
off
a
huge
continuous
roar
and
hum
while
he
was
a
mere
point
of
consciousness
floating
in
the
exact
centre
of
the
heat
and
sound
waves
and
he
listened
listened
for
years
to
the
awful
brazen
hum
from
which
there
could
be
no
escape
at
the
same
time
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
only
a
freshman
on
the
slippery
roof
of
the
tower
trying
to
steal
the
clapper
of
the
chapel
bell
finally
he
came
to
what
he
would
have
considered
a
lucid
interval
had
it
not
appeared
that
helen
sherwood
was
whispering
to
tom
meredith
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
this
he
knew
to
be
a
fictitious
presentation
of
his
fever
for
was
she
not
by
this
time
away
and
away
for
foreign
lands
and
also
tom
meredith
was
a
slim
young
thing
and
not
the
youth
with
an
undeniable
stomach
and
a
baldish
head
who
by
the
grotesque
necromancy
of
his
hallucinations
assumed
a
preposterous
likeness
to
his
old
friend
he
waved
his
hand
to
the
figures
and
they
vanished
like
figments
of
a
dream
but
all
the
same
the
vision
had
been
realistic
enough
for
the
lady
to
look
exquisitely
pretty
no
one
could
help
wishing
to
stay
in
a
world
which
contained
as
charming
a
picture
as
that
and
then
too
quickly
the
moment
of
clearness
passed
and
he
was
troubled
about
the
herald
beseeching
those
near
him
to
put
copies
of
the
paper
in
his
hands
threatening
angrily
to
believe
they
were
deceiving
him
that
his
paper
had
suspended
if
the
three
issues
of
the
week
were
not
instantly
produced
what
did
they
mean
by
keeping
the
truth
from
him
he
knew
the
herald
had
not
come
out
who
was
there
to
get
it
out
in
his
absence
he
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
and
struggled
to
be
up
and
they
had
hard
work
to
quiet
him
but
the
next
night
meredith
waited
near
his
bedside
haggard
and
dishevelled
harkless
had
been
lying
in
a
long
stupor
suddenly
he
spoke
quite
loudly
and
the
young
surgeon
gay
who
leaned
over
him
remembered
the
words
and
the
tone
all
his
life
away
and
away
across
the
waters
said
john
harkless
she
was
here
once
in
what
is
it
john
whispered
meredith
huskily
you
easier
you
and
john
smiled
a
little
as
if
for
an
instant
his
swathed
eyes
penetrated
the
bandages
and
saw
and
knew
his
old
friend
again
that
same
night
a
friend
of
rodney
mccune
sent
a
telegram
from
rouen
he
is
dying
his
paper
is
dead
your
name
goes
before
convention
in
chapter
xiii
james
fisbee
on
monday
morning
three
men
sat
in
council
in
the
herald
office
that
is
if
staring
out
of
dingy
windows
in
a
demented
silence
may
be
called
sitting
in
council
that
was
what
fisbee
and
parker
and
ross
schofield
were
doing
by
almost
desperate
exertions
these
three
and
bud
tipworthy
had
managed
to
place
before
the
public
the
issues
of
the
paper
for
the
previous
week
unaided
by
their
chief
or
rather
aided
by
long
accounts
of
his
condition
and
the
manner
of
his
mishap
and
in
truth
three
copies
were
at
that
moment
in
the
possession
of
dr
gay
accompanied
by
a
note
from
parker
warning
the
surgeon
to
exhibit
them
to
his
patient
only
as
a
last
resort
as
the
foreman
feared
the
perusal
of
them
might
cause
a
relapse
by
indiscriminate
turns
acting
as
editors
reporters
and
typesetters
and
particularly
the
three
men
had
worried
out
three
issues
and
part
of
the
fourth
to
appear
the
next
morning
was
set
up
but
they
had
come
to
the
end
of
their
string
and
there
were
various
horrid
gaps
yet
to
fill
in
spite
of
a
too
generous
spreading
of
advertisements
bud
tipworthy
had
been
sent
out
to
besiege
miss
tibbs
all
of
whose
recent
buds
of
rhyme
had
been
into
inky
blossom
during
the
week
and
after
a
long
absence
the
youth
returned
with
a
somewhat
abrupt
quatrain
entitled
the
parisians
of
old
which
she
had
produced
while
he
waited
only
four
lines
according
to
the
measure
they
meted
which
was
not
regardful
of
art
less
than
a
drop
in
the
bucket
or
to
preserve
the
figure
a
single
posy
where
they
needed
a
bouquet
bud
went
down
the
rickety
outside
stairs
and
sat
on
the
lowest
step
whistling
wait
till
the
clouds
roll
by
jenny
ross
schofield
descended
to
set
up
the
quatrain
and
fisbee
and
parker
were
left
to
silence
and
troubled
meditation
they
were
seated
on
opposite
sides
of
harkless
desk
sheets
of
blank
lay
before
them
and
they
relaxed
not
their
knit
brows
now
and
then
one
of
them
after
gazing
vacantly
about
the
room
for
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
would
attack
the
sheet
before
him
with
fiercest
energy
then
the
energy
would
taper
off
and
the
paragraph
halt
the
writer
peruse
it
dubiously
then
angrily
tear
off
the
sheet
and
hurl
it
to
the
floor
all
around
them
lay
these
snowballs
of
defeated
journalism
parker
was
a
long
loose
gaunt
gentleman
with
a
peremptory
forehead
and
a
capable
jaw
but
on
the
present
occasion
his
capability
was
baffled
and
swamped
in
the
attempt
to
steer
the
craft
of
his
talent
up
an
unaccustomed
channel
without
a
pilot
i
do
see
as
it
any
use
fisbee
he
said
morosely
after
a
series
of
efforts
that
littered
the
floor
in
every
direction
i
a
born
compositor
and
i
ca
shift
my
trade
i
stood
the
pace
fairly
for
a
week
but
i
have
to
give
up
i
run
plumb
dry
i
only
hope
they
wo
show
him
our
saturday
with
your
three
columns
of
word
of
the
lotus
motive
reprinted
from
february
i
begin
to
sympathize
with
the
boss
because
i
know
what
he
felt
when
i
ballyragged
him
for
copy
yes
sir
i
know
how
it
is
to
be
an
editor
in
a
dead
town
we
must
remember
too
said
his
companion
thoughtfully
there
is
the
thursday
issue
of
this
week
to
be
prepared
almost
at
please
do
mention
that
fisbee
parker
tilted
far
back
in
his
chair
with
his
feet
anchored
under
the
desk
preserving
a
precarious
balance
i
ai
as
grateful
for
my
promotion
to
joint
as
i
might
be
i
a
middling
poor
man
for
the
hour
i
guess
he
remarked
painfully
following
the
peregrinations
of
a
fly
on
his
companion
sleeve
fisbee
twisted
up
another
sheet
and
employed
his
eyes
in
following
the
course
of
a
crack
in
the
plaster
a
slender
black
aperture
which
staggered
across
the
dusty
ceiling
and
down
the
dustier
wall
to
disappear
behind
a
still
dustier
map
of
carlow
county
that
the
trouble
exclaimed
parker
observing
the
other
preoccupation
soon
as
you
get
to
writing
a
line
or
two
that
seems
kind
of
promising
you
begin
to
take
a
morbid
interest
in
that
blamed
crack
it
busted
up
enough
copy
for
me
the
last
eight
days
to
have
filled
her
up
twenty
times
over
i
do
know
as
i
ever
care
to
see
that
crack
again
i
turned
my
back
on
it
but
there
was
any
use
in
that
because
if
a
fly
lights
on
you
i
watch
him
like
a
brother
and
if
there
ai
any
fly
i
caught
a
mania
for
tapping
my
teeth
with
a
pencil
that
is
just
as
to
these
two
gentlemen
thus
disengaged
reentered
after
a
much
longer
absence
than
miss
selina
quatrain
justified
ross
schofield
a
healthy
glow
of
exertion
lending
pleasant
color
to
his
earnest
visage
and
an
almost
visible
laurel
of
success
crowning
his
brows
in
addition
to
this
imaginary
ornament
he
was
horned
with
pencils
over
both
ears
and
held
some
scribbled
sheets
in
his
hand
i
done
a
good
deal
down
there
he
announced
cheerfully
drawing
up
a
chair
to
the
desk
i
thought
up
a
heap
of
things
i
heard
lately
and
they
fill
up
mighty
well
that
there
poem
of
miss
seliny
was
a
kind
of
an
inspiration
to
me
and
i
tried
one
myself
and
it
did
come
hard
at
all
when
i
got
started
once
it
jest
seemed
to
flow
from
me
i
did
set
none
of
it
up
he
added
modestly
but
with
evident
consciousness
of
having
unearthed
genius
in
himself
and
an
elate
foreknowledge
of
the
treat
in
store
for
his
companions
i
thought
ort
to
see
how
you
liked
it
he
offered
the
papers
to
parker
but
the
foreman
shook
his
head
you
read
it
ross
i
said
i
do
believe
i
feel
hearty
enough
read
the
items
first
we
can
bear
the
what
waiting
inquired
schofield
for
the
poem
replied
parker
grimly
with
a
vague
but
not
fleeting
smile
ross
settled
the
sheets
in
order
and
exhibited
tokens
of
that
pleasant
nevousness
incident
to
appearing
before
a
critical
audience
armed
with
literature
whose
merits
should
delight
them
out
of
the
critical
attitude
i
run
across
a
great
scheme
down
there
he
volunteered
amiably
by
way
of
preface
i
described
everything
in
full
in
as
many
words
as
i
could
think
up
it
mighty
filling
and
it
please
the
public
too
it
gives
a
lot
more
information
than
they
git
i
reckon
there
two
sticks
of
jest
them
extry
words
go
on
said
the
foreman
rather
ominously
ross
began
to
read
a
matter
necessitating
a
puckered
brow
and
at
times
an
amount
of
hesitancy
and
ruminating
as
his
results
had
already
cooled
a
little
and
he
found
his
hand
difficult
to
decipher
here
the
first
he
said
large
and
handsome
two
years
and
year
old
jersey
of
frederick
bibshaw
jones
esquire
the
foreman
interrupted
him
every
reader
of
the
will
be
glad
to
know
that
jersey
age
and
color
but
go
frederick
bibshaw
jones
esquire
pursued
his
assistant
with
some
discomfiture
esquire
our
popular
and
you
right
bib
jones
is
a
heavy
swell
said
parker
in
a
breaking
voice
citizen
can
be
daily
seen
wandering
from
the
far
end
of
his
to
the
other
far
end
of
it
exclaimed
parker
the
jersey
no
returned
the
other
meekly
bib
oh
said
parker
is
that
the
end
of
that
item
it
is
you
want
to
get
out
of
plattville
my
friend
it
too
small
for
you
you
go
to
rouen
and
you
be
city
editor
of
the
inside
of
a
week
let
have
schofield
looked
up
blankly
however
he
felt
that
there
was
enough
live
legitimate
news
in
his
other
items
to
redeem
the
somewhat
tame
quality
of
the
first
and
so
after
having
crossed
out
several
of
the
extra
words
which
had
met
so
poor
a
reception
he
proceeded
upton
pigs
broke
out
last
wednesday
and
rooted
up
a
fine
patch
of
garden
truck
hard
luck
whit
hawkins
took
a
drive
yesterday
afternoon
he
had
the
bay
to
his
jee
buggy
has
been
recently
washed
congratulations
jee
there
thrilling
information
shouted
the
foreman
that
touch
the
gentle
reader
to
the
marrow
the
boss
had
to
use
some
pretty
rotten
copy
himself
but
he
never
got
as
low
as
that
but
we
use
it
oh
use
it
if
we
do
get
her
out
he
have
a
but
if
they
show
her
to
him
it
kill
him
if
it
does
and
he
gets
well
he
kill
us
but
we
use
it
ross
do
read
any
more
to
us
though
i
feel
weaker
than
i
did
and
i
was
strong
before
go
down
and
set
it
all
schofield
rejoined
with
an
injured
air
and
yet
hopefully
i
like
to
see
what
you
think
of
the
poetry
it
seemed
all
right
to
me
but
i
reckon
you
ai
ever
the
best
judge
of
your
own
work
shall
i
read
it
the
foreman
only
glanced
at
him
in
silence
and
the
young
man
took
this
for
assent
i
have
made
up
any
name
for
it
the
orphan
boy
stood
on
the
hill
the
wind
blew
cold
and
very
chill
glancing
at
his
auditors
he
was
a
trifle
abashed
to
observe
a
glaze
upon
the
eyes
of
parker
while
a
purple
tide
rose
above
his
and
unnaturally
distended
his
throat
and
temples
with
a
placative
little
laugh
schofield
remarked
i
git
the
swing
to
her
all
right
i
reckon
but
somehow
it
does
sound
so
kind
of
good
as
when
i
was
writing
there
was
no
response
and
he
went
on
hurriedly
there
he
saw
the
little
rill
the
poet
paused
to
say
with
another
amiable
laugh
it
sort
of
hard
to
git
out
of
them
ill
hill
chill
rhymes
once
you
strike
it
runs
on
like
this
little
rill
that
curved
and
spattered
around
the
hill
i
guess
that
all
right
to
use
twice
do
you
reckon
so
the
orphan
he
stood
there
until
the
wind
and
all
gave
him
a
chill
and
he
sickened
that
day
ross
read
no
more
for
the
tall
printer
seemingly
incapable
of
coherent
speech
kicked
the
desk
impotently
threw
his
arms
above
his
head
and
his
companions
confidently
looking
to
see
him
foam
at
the
mouth
lost
his
balance
and
toppled
over
backward
his
extensive
legs
waving
wildly
in
the
air
as
he
struck
the
floor
schofield
fled
parker
made
no
effort
to
rise
but
lay
glaring
at
the
ceiling
breathing
hard
he
remained
in
that
position
for
a
long
time
until
finally
the
glaze
wore
away
from
his
eyes
and
a
more
rational
expression
settled
over
his
features
fisbee
addressed
him
timidly
you
do
think
we
could
reduce
the
size
of
the
sheet
it
would
kill
him
answered
his
prostrate
companion
we
got
to
fill
her
solid
some
way
though
i
give
up
i
do
know
how
how
that
man
has
worked
it
was
genius
he
just
floated
around
the
county
and
soaked
in
items
and
he
wrote
editorials
that
people
read
one
certain
we
ca
do
it
we
ruining
his
paper
for
him
and
when
he
gets
able
to
read
it
hurt
him
bad
mighty
few
knew
how
much
pride
he
had
in
it
has
it
struck
you
that
now
would
be
a
precious
good
time
for
it
to
occur
to
rod
mccune
to
come
out
of
his
hole
suppose
we
go
by
the
board
what
to
stop
him
what
to
stop
him
anyway
who
knows
where
the
boss
put
those
copies
and
affidavits
and
if
we
did
know
would
we
know
the
best
way
to
use
if
we
did
what
to
keep
the
alive
until
mccune
lifts
his
head
and
if
we
do
stop
him
the
county
herald
is
finished
something
got
to
be
done
no
one
realized
this
more
poignantly
than
fisbee
but
no
one
was
less
capable
of
doing
something
of
his
own
initiation
and
although
the
tuesday
issue
was
forthcoming
embarrassingly
pale
in
spots
most
spots
martin
remarked
rather
publicly
that
the
items
were
not
what
you
might
call
stirring
and
that
the
unpatented
pages
put
him
in
mind
of
jones
field
in
winter
with
a
dozen
chunks
of
coal
dropped
in
the
snow
and
his
observations
on
the
later
issues
of
the
week
issues
which
were
put
forth
with
a
suggestion
of
spasm
and
possibly
to
the
permanent
injury
of
parker
health
he
looked
so
thin
were
too
cruelly
unkind
to
be
repeated
here
indeed
fisbee
parker
the
luckless
schofield
and
the
young
tipworthy
may
be
not
untruthfully
likened
to
a
band
of
devoted
mariners
lost
in
the
cold
and
glaring
regions
of
a
journalistic
greenland
limitless
plains
of
empty
white
paper
extending
about
them
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
while
life
depended
upon
their
making
these
terrible
voids
productive
and
they
shrank
appalled
from
the
task
knowing
no
means
to
fertilize
the
barrens
having
no
talent
to
bring
the
still
snows
into
harvests
and
already
the
chill
of
martin
remarks
a
touch
of
the
frost
that
might
wither
them
it
was
fisbee
who
caught
the
first
glimpse
of
a
relief
expedition
clipping
the
rough
seas
on
its
lively
way
to
rescue
them
and
although
his
first
glimpse
of
the
jaunty
pennant
of
the
relieving
vessels
was
over
the
shoulder
of
an
iceberg
nothing
was
surer
than
that
the
craft
was
flying
to
them
with
all
good
and
joyous
speed
the
iceberg
just
mentioned
assumed
by
no
melting
process
one
may
be
sure
the
form
of
a
long
letter
first
postmarked
at
rouen
and
its
latter
substance
was
as
follows
henry
and
i
have
always
believed
you
as
selfish
james
fisbee
as
you
are
and
incapable
she
has
told
us
of
your
of
your
her
to
remain
with
you
how
you
after
you
had
her
to
return
to
us
and
how
her
conscience
told
her
she
should
stay
and
share
your
life
in
spite
of
our
long
care
of
her
but
that
she
yielded
to
your
and
our
entreaty
what
have
you
ever
done
for
her
and
what
have
you
to
offer
her
she
is
our
daughter
and
needless
to
say
we
shall
still
take
care
of
her
for
no
one
believes
you
capable
of
it
even
in
that
miserable
place
and
of
course
in
time
she
will
return
to
her
better
wisdom
her
home
and
her
duty
i
need
scarcely
say
we
have
given
up
the
happy
months
we
had
planned
to
spend
in
dresden
henry
and
i
can
only
stay
at
home
to
pray
that
her
preposterous
mania
will
wear
itself
out
in
short
order
as
she
will
find
herself
unfitted
for
the
ridiculous
task
which
she
insists
upon
attempting
against
the
earnest
wishes
of
us
who
have
been
more
than
father
and
mother
to
her
of
course
she
has
talked
volumes
of
her
affection
for
us
and
of
her
gratitude
which
we
do
not
want
we
only
want
her
to
stay
with
us
please
please
try
to
make
her
come
back
to
us
we
can
not
bear
it
long
if
you
are
a
man
you
will
send
her
to
us
soon
her
excuse
for
not
returning
on
the
day
we
wired
our
intention
to
go
abroad
at
once
and
i
may
as
well
tell
you
now
that
our
intention
to
go
was
formed
in
order
to
bring
affairs
to
a
crisis
and
to
draw
her
away
from
your
influence
we
always
dreaded
her
visit
to
you
and
held
it
off
for
years
her
excuse
was
that
your
best
friend
and
as
i
understand
it
your
patron
had
been
injured
in
some
brawl
in
that
christian
country
of
yours
a
charming
place
to
take
a
girl
like
her
and
she
would
not
leave
you
in
your
until
more
was
known
of
the
man
injuries
and
now
she
insists
and
you
will
know
it
from
her
by
the
next
mail
on
returning
to
plattville
forsooth
because
she
has
been
reading
your
newspaper
and
she
says
she
knows
you
are
in
difficulties
over
it
and
it
is
her
moral
obligation
as
by
some
wild
reasoning
of
her
own
she
considers
herself
responsible
for
your
ruffling
patron
having
been
alone
when
he
was
shot
to
go
down
and
help
i
suppose
he
made
love
to
her
as
all
the
young
men
she
meets
always
do
sooner
or
later
but
i
have
no
fear
of
any
rustic
entanglements
tor
her
she
has
never
been
really
interested
save
in
one
affair
we
are
quite
powerless
we
have
done
everything
but
we
can
not
alter
her
determination
to
edit
your
paper
for
you
naturally
she
knows
nothing
whatever
about
such
work
but
she
says
with
the
air
of
triumphantly
quelching
all
such
argument
that
she
has
talked
a
great
deal
to
macauley
of
the
macauley
is
the
affair
i
have
alluded
to
he
is
what
she
has
meant
when
she
has
said
at
different
times
that
she
was
interested
in
journalism
but
she
is
very
now
she
has
bought
a
typewriter
and
purchased
a
great
number
of
soft
pencils
and
erasers
at
an
art
shop
i
am
only
surprised
that
she
does
not
intend
to
edit
your
miserable
paper
in
she
is
coming
at
once
for
mercy
sake
do
telegraph
her
not
to
your
forbiddings
work
the
wrong
way
our
only
hope
is
that
she
will
find
the
conditions
so
utterly
discouraging
at
the
very
start
that
she
will
give
it
up
and
come
home
if
you
are
a
man
you
will
help
to
make
them
so
she
has
promised
to
stay
with
that
country
girl
with
whom
she
contracted
such
an
incomprehensible
friendship
at
miss
jennings
oh
james
pray
for
grace
to
be
a
man
once
in
your
life
and
send
her
back
to
us
be
a
man
try
to
be
a
man
remember
the
angel
you
killed
remember
all
we
have
done
for
you
and
what
a
return
you
have
made
and
be
a
man
for
the
first
time
try
and
be
a
man
your
unhappy
martha
fisbee
read
the
letter
with
a
great
rising
delight
which
no
sense
of
duty
could
down
indeed
he
perceived
that
his
sense
of
duty
had
ceased
to
conflict
with
the
one
strong
hope
of
his
life
just
as
he
perceived
that
to
be
a
man
according
to
martha
sherwood
was
in
part
to
assist
martha
sherwood
to
have
her
way
in
things
and
for
the
rest
to
be
the
sort
of
man
she
persuaded
herself
she
would
be
were
she
not
a
woman
this
he
had
never
been
able
to
be
by
some
whimsy
of
fate
or
by
a
failure
of
karma
or
perhaps
by
some
triumph
of
kismetic
retribution
james
fisbee
was
born
in
one
of
the
most
and
artless
cities
of
a
practical
and
modern
country
of
parents
and
he
was
born
a
dreamer
of
the
past
he
grew
up
a
student
of
basilican
lore
of
of
persian
frescoes
and
an
ardent
lounger
in
the
somewhat
musty
precincts
of
chaldea
and
byzantium
and
babylon
early
christian
symbolism
a
dispute
over
the
site
of
a
greek
temple
the
derivation
of
the
lotus
column
the
restoration
of
a
gothic
buttress
these
were
the
absorbing
questions
of
his
youth
with
now
and
then
a
lighter
moment
spent
in
analytical
consideration
of
the
decorations
of
mark
the
world
buzzed
along
after
its
own
fashion
not
disturbing
him
and
his
absorptions
permitted
only
a
faint
consciousness
of
the
despair
of
his
relatives
regarding
his
mind
arrived
at
and
a
little
more
he
found
himself
alone
in
the
world
though
for
that
matter
he
had
always
been
alone
and
never
of
the
world
and
there
was
plenty
of
money
for
him
with
various
bankers
who
appeared
to
know
about
looking
after
it
returning
to
the
town
of
his
nativity
after
sundry
expeditions
in
syria
upon
which
he
had
been
accompanied
by
dusky
gentlemen
with
pickaxes
and
curly
muskets
he
met
and
was
married
by
a
lady
who
was
ambitious
and
who
saw
in
him
probably
as
a
fulfilment
of
another
kismetic
punishment
a
power
of
learning
and
a
destined
success
not
long
after
the
birth
of
their
only
child
a
daughter
he
was
called
to
fill
the
chair
of
archaeology
in
a
newly
founded
university
one
of
the
kind
which
a
state
and
a
millionaire
combine
to
purchase
this
one
was
handed
down
off
the
shelf
in
a
more
or
less
chaotic
condition
and
for
a
period
of
years
betrayed
considerable
doubt
as
to
its
own
intentions
undecided
whether
they
were
classical
or
technical
and
in
the
settlement
of
that
doubt
lay
the
secret
of
the
past
of
the
one
man
in
plattville
so
unhappy
as
to
possess
a
past
from
that
settlement
and
his
own
preceding
action
resulted
his
downfall
his
disgrace
with
his
wife
relatives
the
loss
of
his
wife
the
rage
surprise
and
anguish
of
her
sister
martha
and
martha
husband
henry
sherwood
and
the
separation
from
his
little
daughter
which
was
by
far
to
him
the
hardest
to
bear
for
fisbee
in
his
own
way
and
without
consulting
anybody
it
never
occurred
to
him
and
he
was
supposed
often
to
forget
that
he
had
a
wife
and
child
had
informally
turned
over
to
the
university
all
the
money
which
the
banks
had
kindly
taken
care
of
and
had
given
it
to
equip
an
expedition
which
never
expedited
a
new
president
of
the
institution
was
installed
he
talked
to
the
trustees
they
met
and
elected
to
become
modern
and
practical
and
technical
they
abolished
the
course
in
fine
arts
which
abolished
fisbee
connection
with
them
and
they
then
employed
his
money
to
erect
a
building
for
the
mechanical
engineering
department
fisbee
was
left
with
nothing
his
wife
and
her
kinsfolk
exhibited
no
brilliancy
in
holding
a
totally
irresponsible
man
down
to
responsibilities
and
they
made
a
tragedy
of
a
not
surprising
fiasco
fisbee
had
lived
in
her
ambitions
and
she
died
of
heartbreak
over
the
discovery
of
what
manner
of
man
she
had
married
but
before
she
died
she
wisely
provided
for
her
daughter
fisbee
told
parker
the
story
after
his
own
queer
fashion
you
see
parker
he
said
as
they
sat
together
in
the
dust
and
litter
of
the
herald
office
on
sunday
afternoon
you
see
i
admit
that
my
has
always
withheld
her
approbation
from
me
and
possibly
her
disapproval
is
well
founded
i
shall
say
probably
my
wife
had
also
a
considerable
sum
and
this
she
turned
over
to
me
at
the
time
of
our
marriage
though
i
had
no
wish
regarding
it
one
way
or
the
other
when
i
gave
my
money
to
the
university
with
which
i
had
the
honor
to
be
connected
i
added
to
it
the
fund
i
had
received
from
her
as
i
was
the
recipient
of
a
comfortable
salary
as
a
lecturer
in
the
institution
and
had
no
fear
of
not
living
well
and
i
was
greatly
interested
in
providing
that
the
expedition
should
be
perfectly
equipped
expeditions
of
the
magnitude
of
that
which
i
had
planned
are
expensive
i
should
perhaps
inform
you
and
this
one
was
to
carry
on
investigations
regarding
several
important
points
very
elaborately
and
i
am
still
convinced
it
would
have
settled
conclusively
many
vital
questions
concerning
the
derivation
of
the
babylonian
column
as
whether
the
lotus
column
may
be
without
prejudice
said
to
but
at
the
present
moment
i
will
not
enter
into
that
i
fear
i
had
no
great
experience
in
money
matters
for
the
transaction
had
been
almost
entirely
verbal
and
there
was
nothing
to
bind
the
trustees
to
carry
out
my
plans
for
the
expedition
they
were
very
sympathetic
but
what
could
they
do
they
begged
leave
to
inquire
such
an
institution
can
not
give
back
money
once
donated
and
it
was
clearly
out
of
character
for
a
school
of
technology
and
engineering
to
send
savants
to
investigate
the
lotus
i
see
parker
observed
genially
he
listened
with
the
most
ingratiating
attention
knowing
that
he
had
a
rich
sensation
to
set
before
plattville
as
a
dish
before
a
king
for
fisbee
was
no
confidential
communication
the
old
man
might
have
told
a
part
of
his
history
long
ago
but
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
to
talk
about
his
affairs
things
had
a
habit
of
not
occurring
to
fisbee
and
the
efforts
of
the
gossips
to
draw
him
out
always
passed
over
his
serene
and
absent
head
it
was
a
blow
to
my
wife
the
old
man
continued
sadly
and
i
can
not
deny
that
her
reproaches
were
as
vehement
as
her
disappointment
was
he
hurried
over
this
portion
of
his
narrative
with
a
vaguely
troubled
look
but
the
intelligent
parker
read
poor
fisbee
state
of
mind
between
the
sentences
she
never
seemed
to
regard
me
in
the
same
light
again
the
archaeologist
went
on
she
did
not
conceal
from
me
that
she
was
surprised
and
that
she
could
not
look
upon
me
as
a
practical
man
indeed
i
may
say
she
appeared
to
regard
me
with
marked
antipathy
she
sent
for
her
sister
and
begged
her
to
take
our
daughter
and
keep
her
from
me
as
she
did
not
consider
me
practical
will
substitute
for
her
more
embittered
expressions
to
provide
for
a
child
and
instruct
it
in
the
world
ways
my
who
was
childless
consented
to
adopt
the
little
one
on
the
conditions
that
i
renounced
all
claim
and
that
the
child
legally
assumed
her
name
and
should
be
in
all
respects
as
her
own
daughter
and
that
i
consented
to
see
her
but
once
a
year
in
rouen
at
my
home
i
should
have
refused
but
i
my
wife
that
is
she
was
very
pressing
in
her
last
hours
and
they
all
seemed
to
feel
that
i
ought
to
make
amends
all
except
the
little
girl
herself
i
should
say
for
she
possessed
even
as
an
infant
an
exceptional
affection
for
her
father
i
had
nothing
my
salary
was
gone
and
i
was
discomfited
by
the
combined
actions
of
the
trustees
and
my
relatives
so
i
i
gave
her
up
to
them
and
my
wife
passed
away
in
a
more
cheerful
frame
of
mind
i
think
that
is
about
all
one
of
the
instructors
obtained
the
position
here
for
me
which
i
i
finally
lost
and
i
went
to
see
the
little
girl
every
new
year
day
this
year
she
declared
her
intention
of
visiting
but
she
was
persuaded
by
friends
who
were
conversant
with
the
circumstances
to
stay
with
them
where
i
could
be
with
her
almost
as
much
as
at
my
apartment
at
tibbs
she
had
long
since
declared
her
intention
of
some
day
returning
to
live
with
me
and
when
she
came
she
was
strenuous
in
insisting
that
the
day
had
the
old
man
voice
broke
suddenly
as
he
observed
she
has
a
very
beautiful
character
the
foreman
nodded
with
warm
confirmation
i
believe
you
sir
yes
sir
i
saw
her
and
i
guess
she
looks
it
you
take
that
kind
of
a
lady
usually
and
catch
her
in
a
crowd
like
the
one
and
she
help
doing
the
grand
duchess
giving
the
tenants
a
treat
but
not
her
she
did
seem
to
herself
from
some
she
is
a
fine
lady
said
the
other
simply
i
did
not
accept
her
renunciation
though
i
acknowledge
i
forbade
it
with
a
very
poignant
envy
i
could
not
be
the
cause
of
her
giving
up
for
my
sake
her
state
of
ease
and
luxury
for
my
relatives
are
more
than
and
they
made
it
plain
she
must
choose
between
them
and
me
with
the
design
i
think
of
making
it
more
difficult
to
choose
me
and
also
it
seemed
to
me
as
it
did
to
her
that
she
owed
them
nearly
everything
but
she
declared
i
had
lived
alone
so
long
that
she
owed
me
everything
also
she
is
a
beautiful
character
well
said
parker
after
a
pause
the
town
will
be
upside
down
over
this
and
folks
will
be
mighty
glad
to
have
it
explained
about
your
being
out
there
so
much
and
at
the
deepo
and
all
this
and
that
everybody
in
the
place
has
been
wondering
what
in
that
is
he
finished
in
some
confusion
that
is
what
i
started
to
say
was
that
it
wo
be
so
bad
as
it
might
be
having
a
lady
in
the
office
here
i
do
cuss
to
speak
of
and
ross
can
lay
off
on
his
till
the
boss
comes
back
besides
it
our
only
chance
if
she
ca
make
the
hum
we
go
to
the
the
old
man
did
not
seem
to
hear
him
i
forbade
the
renunciation
she
wished
to
make
for
my
sake
he
said
gently
but
i
accept
it
now
for
the
sake
of
our
stricken
friend
for
and
for
the
carlow
completed
the
foreman
the
morning
following
that
upon
which
this
conversation
took
place
the
two
gentlemen
stood
together
on
the
station
platform
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
express
from
rouen
it
was
a
wet
gray
day
the
wide
country
lay
dripping
under
formless
wraps
of
thin
mist
and
a
warm
drizzling
rain
blackened
the
shingles
of
the
station
made
puddles
of
the
unevenly
worn
planks
of
the
platform
and
dampened
the
that
never
went
anywhere
too
thoroughly
for
occupation
by
the
and
ran
in
a
little
crystal
stream
off
fisbee
brown
cotton
umbrella
and
down
back
the
driver
bennett
the
proprietor
of
two
attendant
and
three
or
four
other
worthies
whom
business
or
the
lack
of
it
called
to
that
locality
availed
themselves
of
the
shelter
of
the
but
the
gentlemen
of
the
herald
were
too
agitated
to
be
confined
save
by
the
limits
of
the
horizon
they
had
reached
the
station
half
an
hour
before
train
time
and
consumed
the
interval
in
pacing
the
platform
under
the
cotton
umbrella
addressing
each
other
only
in
monosyllables
those
in
the
gossiped
eagerly
and
for
the
thousandth
time
about
the
late
events
and
the
tremendous
news
concerning
fisbee
judd
bennett
looked
out
through
the
rainy
doorway
at
the
latter
with
reverence
and
a
fine
pride
of
townsmanship
declaring
it
to
be
his
belief
that
fisbee
and
parker
were
waiting
for
her
at
the
present
moment
it
was
a
lady
and
a
bird
of
a
lady
too
else
why
should
cale
parker
be
wearing
a
coat
and
be
otherwise
dooded
and
fixed
up
beyond
any
wedding
judd
and
his
friends
were
somewhat
excited
over
parker
fisbee
was
clad
in
his
best
shabby
black
which
lent
an
air
of
state
to
the
occasion
but
parker
caleb
parker
whose
heart
during
his
five
years
of
residence
in
plattville
had
been
against
all
the
feminine
blandishments
of
the
town
whose
long
lank
face
had
shown
beneath
as
long
and
lanker
locks
of
proverbially
uncombed
hair
he
who
had
for
weeks
conspicuously
affected
a
single
suspender
who
never
even
upon
the
sabbath
day
wore
a
collar
or
blacked
his
shoes
what
aesthetic
leaven
had
entered
his
soul
that
he
donned
not
a
coat
alone
but
also
a
waistcoat
with
checks
and
more
than
a
gleaming
celluloid
collar
and
more
than
that
a
brilliant
blue
tie
what
had
this
iron
youth
to
do
with
a
rising
excitement
at
train
time
and
brilliant
blue
ties
also
it
might
have
been
inquired
if
this
parade
of
fashion
had
no
connection
with
the
simultaneous
action
of
ross
schofield
for
ross
was
at
this
hour
engaged
in
decorating
the
battered
chairs
in
the
herald
editorial
room
with
blue
satin
ribbon
the
purchase
of
which
at
the
dry
goods
emporium
had
been
directed
by
a
sudden
inspiration
of
his
superior
of
the
composing
force
it
was
ross
intention
to
garnish
each
chair
with
an
elaborately
tied
bow
but
as
he
was
no
sailor
and
understood
only
the
intricacies
of
a
he
confined
himself
to
that
species
of
ornamentation
leaving
however
very
long
ends
of
ribbon
hanging
down
after
the
manner
of
the
pendants
of
rosettes
it
scarcely
needs
the
statement
that
his
labors
were
in
honor
of
the
new
of
the
carlow
the
advent
and
the
purposes
of
this
personage
were
as
yet
known
certainly
to
only
those
of
the
herald
and
to
the
briscoes
it
had
been
arranged
however
that
minnie
and
her
father
were
not
to
come
to
the
station
for
the
journalistic
crisis
was
immoderately
pressing
the
herald
was
to
appear
on
the
morrow
and
the
new
editor
wished
to
plunge
directly
and
without
the
briefest
distraction
into
the
paper
difficulties
now
accumulated
into
a
veritable
sea
of
troubles
the
editor
was
to
be
delivered
to
the
briscoes
at
eventide
and
returned
by
them
again
at
dewy
morn
and
this
was
to
be
the
daily
programme
it
had
been
further
and
most
earnestly
stipulated
that
when
the
wounded
proprietor
of
the
ailing
journal
should
be
informed
of
the
addition
to
his
forces
he
was
not
to
know
or
to
have
the
slenderest
hint
of
the
sex
or
identity
of
the
person
in
charge
during
his
absence
it
was
inevitable
that
plattville
already
gaping
to
the
uttermost
would
buzz
voluminously
over
it
before
night
but
judge
briscoe
volunteered
to
prevent
the
buzz
from
reaching
rouen
he
undertook
to
interview
whatever
citizens
should
visit
harkless
or
write
to
him
when
his
illness
permitted
visits
and
letters
and
forewarn
them
of
the
incumbent
desires
the
judge
stayed
at
home
with
his
daughter
who
trilled
about
the
house
for
happiness
and
in
their
place
the
herald
deputation
of
two
had
repaired
to
the
station
to
act
as
a
reception
committee
far
away
the
whistle
of
the
express
was
heard
muffled
to
sweetness
in
the
damp
and
the
drivers
whip
in
hand
came
out
upon
the
platform
and
the
loafers
issued
also
to
stand
under
the
eaves
and
lean
their
backs
against
the
drier
boards
preparing
to
eye
the
travellers
with
languid
raillery
parker
very
nervous
himself
felt
the
old
man
elbow
trembling
against
his
own
as
the
great
engine
reeking
in
the
mist
and
sending
great
clouds
of
white
vapor
up
to
the
sky
rushed
by
them
and
came
to
a
standstill
beyond
the
platform
fisbee
and
the
foreman
made
haste
to
the
nearest
vestibule
and
were
gazing
blankly
at
its
barred
approaches
when
they
heard
a
tremulous
laugh
behind
them
and
an
exclamation
upstairs
and
downstairs
and
in
my
lady
chamber
just
behind
you
turning
quickly
parker
beheld
a
blushing
and
smiling
little
vision
a
vision
with
hair
a
vision
enveloped
in
a
and
with
brown
gloves
from
which
the
handles
of
a
big
brown
travelling
bag
were
let
fall
as
the
vision
disappeared
under
the
cotton
umbrella
while
the
smitten
judd
bennett
reeled
gasping
against
the
station
dearest
the
girl
cried
to
the
old
man
you
were
looking
for
me
between
the
devil
and
deep
sea
the
and
the
smoker
given
up
cigars
and
i
begun
to
study
economy
so
i
did
come
on
there
was
but
this
one
passenger
for
plattville
two
enormous
trunks
thundered
out
of
the
baggage
car
onto
the
truck
and
it
was
the
work
of
no
more
than
a
minute
for
judd
to
hale
them
to
the
top
of
the
omnibus
he
well
wished
to
wear
them
next
his
heart
but
their
dimensions
forbade
the
thought
and
immediately
he
cracked
his
whip
and
drove
off
furiously
through
the
mud
to
deposit
his
freight
at
the
briscoes
parker
fisbee
and
the
new
set
forth
directly
after
in
one
of
the
waiting
the
foreman
in
front
with
the
driver
and
holding
the
big
brown
bag
on
his
knees
in
much
the
same
manner
he
would
have
held
an
alien
yet
respected
infant
chapter
xiv
a
rescue
the
drizzle
and
mist
blew
in
under
the
top
of
the
as
they
drove
rapidly
into
town
and
bright
little
drops
sparkled
on
the
fair
hair
above
the
new
editor
forehead
and
on
the
long
lashes
above
the
new
editor
cheeks
she
shook
these
transient
gems
off
lightly
as
she
paused
in
the
doorway
of
the
office
at
the
top
of
the
rickety
stairway
schofield
had
just
added
the
last
touch
to
his
decorations
and
managed
to
slide
into
his
coat
as
the
party
came
up
the
stairs
and
now
perspiring
proud
embarrassed
he
assumed
an
attitude
at
once
deprecatory
of
his
endeavors
and
pointedly
expectant
of
commendation
for
the
results
he
was
a
modest
youth
and
a
conscious
after
his
first
sight
of
her
as
she
stood
in
the
doorway
it
was
several
days
before
he
could
lift
his
distressed
eyes
under
her
glance
or
indeed
dare
to
avail
himself
of
more
than
a
hasty
and
fluttering
stare
at
her
when
her
back
was
turned
as
she
entered
the
room
he
sidled
along
the
wall
and
laughed
sheepishly
at
nothing
every
chair
in
the
room
was
ornamented
with
one
of
his
blue
rosettes
tied
carefully
and
firmly
to
the
middle
slat
of
each
there
had
been
several
yards
of
ribbon
left
over
and
there
was
a
hard
knot
of
glossy
satin
on
each
of
the
and
on
the
a
blue
band
passing
around
the
stovepipe
imparted
an
antique
rakishness
suggestive
of
the
charioteer
and
a
number
of
streamers
suspended
from
a
hook
in
the
ceiling
encouraged
a
supposition
that
the
employees
of
the
herald
contemplated
the
intricate
festivities
of
may
day
it
needed
no
genius
to
infer
that
these
garnitures
had
not
embellished
the
editorial
chamber
during
harkless
activity
but
on
the
contrary
had
been
put
in
place
that
very
morning
fisbee
had
not
known
of
the
decorations
and
as
his
glance
fell
upon
them
a
faint
look
of
pain
passed
over
his
brow
but
the
girl
examined
the
room
with
a
dancing
eye
and
there
were
both
tears
and
laughter
in
her
heart
how
beautiful
she
cried
how
beautiful
she
crossed
the
room
and
gave
her
hand
to
ross
it
is
schofield
is
it
the
ribbons
are
delightful
i
did
know
harkless
room
was
so
ross
looked
out
of
the
window
and
laughed
as
he
took
her
hand
which
he
shook
with
a
long
up
and
down
motion
but
he
was
set
at
better
ease
by
her
apparent
unrecognition
of
the
fact
that
the
decorations
were
for
her
oh
it
ai
much
i
reckon
he
replied
and
continued
to
look
out
of
the
window
and
laugh
she
went
to
the
desk
and
removed
her
gloves
and
laid
her
over
a
chair
near
by
is
this
harkless
chair
she
asked
and
fisbee
answering
that
it
was
she
looked
gravely
at
it
for
a
moment
passed
her
hand
gently
over
the
back
of
it
and
then
throwing
the
over
another
chair
said
cheerily
do
you
know
i
think
the
first
thing
for
us
to
do
will
be
to
dust
everything
very
you
remember
i
was
confident
she
would
know
precisely
where
to
begin
was
fisbee
earnest
whisper
in
the
willing
ear
of
the
long
foreman
not
an
instant
indecision
was
there
no
siree
replied
the
other
and
as
he
went
down
to
the
to
hunt
for
a
which
he
thought
might
be
found
there
he
collared
bud
tipworthy
who
not
admitted
to
the
conclave
of
his
superiors
was
whistling
on
the
rainy
stairway
you
hustle
and
find
that
dust
brush
we
used
to
have
bud
said
parker
and
presently
as
they
rummaged
in
the
nooks
and
crannies
about
the
machinery
he
melted
to
his
small
assistant
the
paper
is
saved
buddie
saved
by
an
angel
in
light
brown
you
can
tell
it
by
the
look
of
gee
said
bud
schofield
had
come
blushing
to
join
them
say
cale
did
you
notice
the
color
of
her
eyes
yes
they
i
thought
so
too
show
day
and
at
kedge
halloway
lecture
but
say
cale
they
kind
of
changeable
when
she
come
in
upstairs
with
you
and
fisbee
they
were
jest
as
blue
near
matched
the
color
of
our
gee
repeated
tipworthy
when
the
editorial
chamber
had
been
made
so
beat
that
it
almost
glowed
though
it
could
never
be
expected
to
shine
as
did
fisbee
and
caleb
parker
and
ross
schofield
that
morning
the
editor
took
her
seat
at
the
desk
and
looked
over
the
few
items
the
gentlemen
had
already
compiled
for
her
perusal
parker
explained
many
technicalities
peculiar
to
the
carlow
herald
translated
some
phrases
of
the
and
enabled
her
to
grasp
the
amount
of
matter
needed
to
fill
the
morrow
issue
when
parker
finished
the
three
incompetents
sat
watching
the
little
figure
with
the
expression
of
hopeful
and
trusting
terriers
she
knit
her
brow
for
a
second
but
she
did
not
betray
an
instant
indecision
i
think
we
should
have
regular
market
reports
she
announced
thoughtfully
i
am
sure
harkless
would
approve
do
you
think
he
would
she
turned
to
parker
market
reports
fisbee
exclaimed
i
should
never
have
thought
of
market
reports
nor
do
i
imagine
would
either
of
my
my
associates
a
woman
to
conceive
the
idea
of
market
reports
the
editor
blushed
why
who
would
dear
if
not
a
woman
or
a
speculator
and
i
not
a
speculator
and
neither
are
you
and
the
reason
you
did
think
of
them
so
parker
as
there
is
so
much
pressure
and
if
you
do
mind
continuing
to
act
as
reporter
as
well
as
compositor
until
after
and
if
it
is
too
wet
you
must
take
an
umbrella
would
it
be
too
much
bother
if
you
went
around
to
all
the
shops
i
mean
to
all
the
grocers
and
the
butchers
and
that
leather
place
we
passed
the
tannery
and
if
there
one
of
those
places
where
they
bring
cows
would
it
be
too
much
to
ask
you
to
stop
there
and
at
the
if
it
is
too
far
and
at
the
store
and
you
must
take
a
and
sharpened
pencil
and
will
you
price
everything
please
and
jot
down
how
much
things
are
orders
received
the
impetuous
parker
was
departing
on
the
instant
when
she
stopped
him
with
a
little
cry
but
you
have
any
umbrella
and
she
forced
her
own
a
slender
wand
upon
him
it
bore
a
cunningly
wrought
handle
and
its
fabric
was
of
glistening
silk
the
foreman
unable
to
decline
it
thanked
her
awkwardly
and
as
she
turned
to
speak
to
fisbee
bolted
out
of
the
door
and
ran
down
the
steps
without
unfolding
the
umbrella
and
as
he
made
for
martin
emporium
he
buttoned
it
securely
under
his
long
prince
albert
determined
that
not
a
drop
of
water
should
touch
and
ruin
so
delicate
a
thing
thus
he
carried
it
triumphantly
dry
through
the
course
of
his
reportings
of
that
day
when
he
had
gone
the
editor
laid
her
hand
on
fisbee
arm
dear
she
said
do
you
think
you
would
take
cold
if
you
went
over
to
the
hotel
and
made
a
note
of
all
the
arrivals
for
the
last
week
and
the
departures
too
i
noticed
that
harkless
always
filled
two
or
three
sticks
is
it
with
them
and
things
about
them
and
somehow
it
very
nicely
you
must
ask
the
landlord
all
about
them
and
if
there
are
any
we
can
take
up
the
same
amount
of
space
lamenting
the
dull
times
just
as
he
used
to
you
see
i
read
the
faithfully
is
it
a
good
thing
i
always
subscribed
for
it
she
patted
fisbee
cheek
and
laughed
gaily
into
his
mild
vague
old
eyes
it
wo
be
this
scramble
to
up
much
longer
i
have
plans
gentlemen
she
cried
and
before
long
we
will
print
news
and
we
must
buy
matter
instead
of
insides
and
i
had
a
talk
with
the
associated
press
people
in
rouen
but
that
for
afterwhile
and
i
went
to
the
hospital
this
morning
before
i
left
they
would
let
me
see
him
again
but
they
told
me
all
about
him
and
he
better
and
i
got
tom
to
go
to
the
jail
he
was
so
mystified
he
does
know
what
i
wanted
it
for
and
he
saw
some
of
those
beasts
and
i
can
do
a
column
of
description
besides
an
editorial
about
them
and
i
will
be
fierce
enough
to
suit
carlow
you
may
believe
that
and
i
been
talking
to
senator
burns
that
is
listening
to
senator
burns
which
is
much
stupider
and
i
think
i
can
do
an
article
on
national
politics
i
not
very
well
up
on
local
issues
yet
but
i
she
broke
off
suddenly
there
i
think
we
can
get
out
number
without
any
trouble
by
the
time
you
get
back
from
the
hotel
father
i
have
half
my
stuff
written
up
i
mean
take
your
big
umbrella
and
go
dear
and
please
ask
at
the
express
office
if
my
typewriter
has
she
laughed
again
with
sheer
delight
like
a
child
and
ran
to
the
corner
and
got
the
cotton
umbrella
and
placed
it
in
the
old
man
hand
as
he
reached
the
door
she
called
after
him
wait
and
went
to
him
and
knelt
before
him
and
with
the
humblest
proudest
grace
in
the
world
turned
up
his
trousers
to
keep
them
from
the
mud
ross
schofield
had
never
considered
fisbee
a
particularly
sacred
sort
of
person
but
he
did
from
that
moment
the
old
man
made
some
timid
protest
at
his
daughter
action
but
she
answered
the
great
ladies
used
to
buckle
the
chevalier
bayard
spurs
for
him
and
you
a
great
deal
nicer
than
the
chev
have
any
i
do
believe
of
you
have
any
rubbers
and
not
until
both
fisbee
and
schofield
had
promised
to
purchase
overshoes
at
once
and
in
the
meantime
not
to
step
in
any
puddles
would
she
let
her
father
depart
upon
his
errand
he
crossed
the
square
with
the
strangest
jauntiest
step
ever
seen
in
plattville
solomon
tibbs
had
a
warm
argument
with
miss
selina
as
to
his
identity
miss
selina
maintaining
that
the
figure
under
the
big
umbrella
only
the
legs
and
were
visible
to
them
was
that
of
a
stranger
probably
an
englishman
in
the
herald
office
the
editor
turned
smiling
to
the
remaining
vassal
mr
schofield
i
heard
some
talk
in
rouen
of
an
oil
company
that
had
been
formed
to
prospect
for
kerosene
in
carlow
county
do
you
know
anything
about
it
ross
surfeited
with
honor
terror
and
possessed
by
a
sweet
distress
at
finding
himself
with
the
lady
looked
at
the
wall
and
replied
oh
it
that
eph
watts
do
you
know
if
they
have
begun
to
dig
for
it
yet
said
ross
have
they
begun
the
diggings
yet
no
i
think
not
they
got
a
contrapshun
fixed
up
about
three
mile
south
i
do
reckon
they
begun
yet
hardly
they
the
machinery
in
place
i
heard
eph
say
they
begin
to
bore
i
mean
i
meant
to
say
dig
he
stopped
utterly
confused
and
unhappy
and
she
understood
his
manly
purpose
and
knew
him
for
a
gentleman
whom
she
liked
you
must
be
too
much
surprised
she
said
but
in
spite
of
my
ignorance
about
such
things
i
mean
to
devote
a
good
deal
of
space
to
the
oil
company
it
may
come
to
be
of
great
importance
to
carlow
we
wo
go
into
it
in
paper
beyond
an
item
or
so
but
do
you
think
you
could
possibly
find
watts
and
ask
him
for
some
information
as
to
their
progress
and
if
it
would
be
too
much
trouble
for
him
to
call
here
some
time
afternoon
or
the
day
after
i
want
him
to
give
me
an
interview
if
he
will
tell
him
please
he
will
very
greatly
oblige
oh
he
come
all
right
answered
her
companion
quickly
take
tibbs
buggy
and
go
down
there
right
off
eph
wo
lose
no
time
gittin
and
with
this
encouraging
assurance
he
was
flying
forth
when
he
like
the
others
was
detained
by
her
solicitous
care
she
was
a
born
mother
he
protested
that
in
the
buggy
he
would
be
perfectly
sheltered
besides
there
was
another
umbrella
about
the
place
he
to
get
wet
anyway
had
always
loved
rain
the
end
of
it
was
that
he
went
away
in
a
sort
of
tremor
wearing
her
over
his
shoulders
which
garment
as
it
covered
its
owner
completely
when
she
wore
it
hung
almost
to
his
knees
he
darted
around
a
corner
and
there
breathing
deeply
tenderly
removed
it
then
borrowing
paper
and
cord
at
a
neighboring
store
wrapped
it
neatly
and
stole
back
to
the
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
herald
building
and
left
the
package
in
charge
of
bud
tipworthy
mysteriously
charging
him
to
care
for
it
as
for
his
own
life
and
not
to
open
it
but
if
the
lady
so
much
as
set
one
foot
out
of
doors
before
his
return
to
hand
it
to
her
with
the
message
he
borrowed
another
off
left
alone
the
lady
went
to
the
desk
and
stood
for
a
time
looking
gravely
at
harkless
chair
she
touched
it
gently
as
she
had
touched
it
once
before
that
morning
and
then
she
spoke
to
it
as
if
he
were
sitting
there
and
as
she
would
not
have
spoken
had
he
been
sitting
there
you
did
want
gratitude
did
you
she
whispered
with
sad
lips
soon
she
smiled
at
the
blue
ribbons
patted
the
chair
gaily
on
the
back
and
seizing
upon
pencil
and
pad
dashed
into
her
work
with
rare
energy
she
bent
low
over
the
desk
her
pencil
moving
rapidly
and
except
for
a
momentary
interruption
from
tipworthy
she
seemed
not
to
pause
for
breath
certainly
her
pencil
did
not
she
had
covered
many
sheets
when
her
father
returned
and
as
he
came
in
softly
not
to
disturb
her
she
was
so
deeply
engrossed
she
did
not
hear
him
nor
did
she
look
up
when
parker
entered
but
pursued
the
formulation
of
her
ideas
with
the
same
single
purpose
and
abandon
so
the
two
men
sat
and
waited
while
their
chieftainess
wrote
absorbedly
at
last
she
glanced
up
and
made
a
little
startled
exclamation
at
seeing
them
there
and
then
gave
them
cheery
greeting
each
placed
several
scribbled
sheets
before
her
and
she
having
first
assured
herself
that
fisbee
had
bought
his
overshoes
and
having
expressed
a
fear
that
parker
had
found
her
umbrella
too
small
as
he
looked
damp
and
indeed
he
damp
cried
praises
on
their
notes
and
offered
the
reporters
great
applause
it
is
all
so
splendid
she
cried
how
could
you
do
it
so
quickly
and
in
the
rain
too
this
is
exactly
what
we
need
i
done
most
of
the
things
i
mentioned
i
think
and
made
a
draught
of
some
plans
for
hereafter
and
about
that
man
coming
out
for
congress
i
must
tell
you
it
is
my
greatest
hope
that
he
will
we
can
let
it
go
until
he
does
and
then
but
does
it
seem
to
you
that
it
would
be
a
good
notion
for
the
to
have
a
woman
page
feminine
readers
or
interest
to
women
once
a
week
a
woman
page
exclaimed
fisbee
i
could
never
have
thought
of
that
could
you
parker
and
now
she
continued
i
think
that
when
i
gone
over
what
written
and
beat
it
into
better
shape
i
shall
be
ready
for
something
to
eat
is
it
almost
time
for
luncheon
this
simple
and
surely
natural
inquiry
had
a
singular
devastating
effect
upon
her
hearers
they
looked
upon
each
other
with
fallen
jaws
and
complete
stupefaction
the
old
man
began
to
grow
pale
and
parker
glared
about
him
with
a
wild
eye
fortunately
the
editor
was
too
busy
at
her
work
to
notice
their
agitation
she
applied
herself
to
making
alterations
here
and
there
sometimes
frowningly
crossing
out
whole
lines
and
even
paragraphs
sometimes
smiling
and
beaming
at
the
writing
and
as
she
bent
earnestly
over
the
paper
against
the
darkness
of
the
rainy
day
the
glamour
about
her
fair
hair
was
like
a
light
in
the
room
to
the
minds
of
her
two
companions
this
lustre
was
a
gentle
but
unbearable
accusation
and
each
dreaded
the
moment
when
her
work
should
be
finished
with
a
great
dread
there
was
a
small
adjoining
the
office
and
presently
parker
sweating
at
the
brow
walked
in
there
the
old
man
gave
him
a
look
of
despairing
reproach
but
in
a
moment
the
foreman
voice
was
heard
oh
fisbee
can
you
step
here
a
second
yes
indeed
was
fisbee
reply
and
he
fled
guiltily
into
the
and
parker
closed
the
door
they
stood
in
the
clutter
and
lumber
facing
each
other
abjectly
well
we
both
done
anyway
fisbee
remarked
the
foreman
indubitably
parker
the
old
man
answered
it
is
too
never
to
think
a
blame
thing
about
dinner
for
her
parker
continued
remorsefully
and
her
a
lady
that
can
turn
off
copy
like
a
rotary
snowplough
in
a
dakota
blizzard
did
you
see
the
sheets
she
piled
up
on
that
desk
there
is
no
cafe
nothing
in
plattville
that
could
prepare
food
worthy
of
her
groaned
fisbee
nothing
and
we
never
thought
of
it
never
made
a
single
arrangement
never
struck
us
she
did
live
on
keeping
us
dry
and
being
good
i
how
can
i
go
there
and
tell
her
that
lord
she
can
not
go
to
the
hotel
well
i
guess
not
it
ai
fit
for
her
lum
table
is
hard
enough
on
a
strong
man
landis
does
know
a
good
cake
from
a
fiji
missionary
pudding
i
do
expect
pie
is
much
her
style
and
besides
the
palace
hotel
pies
well
the
boss
was
a
mighty
uncomplaining
man
but
i
used
to
notice
his
articles
on
field
drainage
got
kind
of
sour
and
when
they
been
having
more
than
the
regular
allowance
of
pie
for
dinner
she
ca
go
there
anyway
it
no
use
it
after
two
and
the
shuts
off
at
one
i
wonder
what
kind
of
cake
she
likes
i
do
know
said
the
perplexed
fisbee
if
we
ask
her
if
we
could
sort
of
get
it
out
of
her
diplomatically
we
could
telegraph
to
rouen
for
a
good
ha
said
the
other
brightening
up
you
try
it
parker
i
fear
i
have
not
much
skill
in
diplomacy
but
if
you
the
compositor
mouth
drooped
at
the
corners
and
he
interrupted
gloomily
but
it
would
get
here
till
true
it
would
they
fell
into
a
despondent
reverie
with
their
chins
in
their
bosoms
there
came
a
cheerful
voice
from
the
next
room
but
to
them
it
brought
no
cheer
in
their
ears
it
sounded
weak
from
the
need
of
food
and
faint
with
piteous
reproach
father
are
you
coming
to
have
luncheon
with
me
mr
parker
what
are
we
to
do
whispered
the
old
man
hoarsely
is
it
too
far
to
take
her
to
briscoes
in
the
rain
take
her
with
you
to
their
noon
meal
is
long
since
over
and
their
larder
is
not
is
not
father
called
the
girl
she
was
stirring
they
could
hear
her
moving
about
the
room
you
got
to
go
in
and
tell
her
said
the
foreman
desperately
and
together
they
stumbled
into
the
room
a
small
table
at
one
end
of
it
was
laid
with
a
snowy
cloth
and
there
was
a
fragrance
of
tea
and
amidst
various
dainties
one
caught
a
glimpse
of
cold
chicken
and
lettuce
leaves
fisbee
stopped
dumfounded
but
the
foreman
after
stammeringly
declining
an
invitation
to
partake
alleging
that
his
own
meal
awaited
sped
down
to
the
and
seized
upon
bud
tipworthy
with
a
heavy
hand
where
did
all
that
come
from
up
there
leave
go
me
that
all
that
tea
and
chicken
and
salad
and
wafers
all
kinds
of
things
sardines
for
all
i
know
they
come
in
briscoes
buckboard
while
you
was
gone
briscoes
sent
in
a
basket
i
took
up
and
she
set
the
basket
under
the
table
seen
it
if
you
looked
that
and
it
was
unjust
to
cuff
the
perfectly
innocent
and
mystified
bud
and
worse
not
to
tell
him
what
the
punishment
was
for
before
the
day
was
over
system
had
been
introduced
and
the
herald
was
running
on
it
and
all
that
warm
rainy
afternoon
the
editor
and
fisbee
worked
in
the
editorial
rooms
parker
and
bud
and
schofield
after
his
return
with
the
items
and
a
courteous
message
from
ephraim
watts
bent
over
the
forms
downstairs
and
uncle
xenophon
was
cleaning
the
and
scrubbing
the
floor
an
extraordinary
number
of
errands
took
the
various
members
of
the
printing
force
up
to
see
the
literally
to
see
the
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
the
presence
had
not
flown
hard
to
keep
believing
without
the
repeated
testimony
of
sight
that
the
dingy
room
upstairs
was
actually
the
setting
for
their
jewel
and
a
jewel
they
swore
she
was
the
printers
came
down
chuckling
and
gurgling
after
each
interview
it
was
partly
the
thought
that
she
belonged
to
the
herald
paper
once
ross
as
he
cut
down
one
of
the
temporarily
distended
advertisements
looked
up
and
caught
the
foreman
giggling
to
himself
what
in
the
name
of
you
laughin
at
cale
he
asked
what
are
laughing
at
rejoined
the
other
i
dunno
the
day
wore
on
wet
and
dreary
outside
but
all
within
the
herald
bosom
was
snug
and
busy
and
murmurous
with
the
healthy
thrum
of
life
and
prosperity
renewed
toward
six
system
accomplished
the
new
was
deliberating
on
a
policy
as
harkless
would
conceive
a
policy
were
he
there
when
minnie
briscoe
ran
joyously
up
the
stairs
plunged
into
the
room
waterproofed
and
radiant
and
caught
her
friend
in
her
eager
arms
and
put
an
end
to
policy
for
that
day
but
policy
and
labor
did
not
end
at
twilight
every
day
there
were
evenings
as
in
the
time
of
harkless
when
lamps
shone
from
the
upper
windows
of
the
herald
building
for
the
little
editor
worked
hard
and
sometimes
she
worked
late
she
always
worked
early
she
made
some
mistakes
at
first
and
one
or
two
blunders
which
she
took
more
seriously
than
any
one
else
did
but
she
found
a
remedy
for
all
such
results
of
her
inexperience
and
she
developed
experience
she
set
at
her
task
with
the
energy
of
her
youthfulness
and
no
limit
to
her
ambition
and
she
felt
that
harkless
had
prepared
the
way
for
a
wide
expansion
of
the
paper
interests
wider
than
he
knew
she
had
a
belief
that
there
were
possibilities
for
a
country
newspaper
and
she
brought
a
fresh
point
of
view
to
operate
in
a
situation
where
harkless
had
fallen
perhaps
too
much
in
the
rut
and
she
watched
every
chance
with
a
keen
eye
and
looked
ahead
of
her
with
clear
foresight
what
she
waited
and
yearned
for
and
dreaded
was
the
time
when
a
copy
of
the
new
herald
should
be
placed
in
the
trembling
hands
of
the
man
who
lay
in
the
rouen
hospital
then
she
felt
if
he
unaware
of
her
identity
should
place
everything
in
her
hands
unreservedly
that
would
be
a
tribute
to
her
work
and
how
hard
she
would
labor
to
deserve
it
after
a
time
she
began
to
realize
that
as
his
representative
and
the
editor
of
the
herald
she
had
become
a
factor
in
district
politics
it
took
her
breath
but
with
a
gasp
of
delight
for
there
was
something
she
wanted
to
do
above
all
she
brought
a
light
heart
to
her
work
one
evening
in
the
latter
part
of
that
first
week
of
the
new
regime
parker
perceived
bud
tipworthy
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
beckoning
him
silently
to
come
without
what
the
matter
buddie
listen
she
singin
over
her
parker
stepped
outside
on
the
pavement
people
had
stopped
to
listen
they
stood
in
the
shadow
looking
up
with
parted
lips
at
the
open
lighted
windows
whence
came
a
clear
soft
reaching
voice
lifted
in
song
now
it
swelled
louder
unconsciously
now
its
volume
was
more
slender
and
it
melted
liquidly
into
the
night
again
it
trembled
and
rose
and
dwelt
in
the
ear
strong
and
pure
and
hearing
it
you
sighed
with
unknown
longings
it
was
the
angels
bud
tipworthy
sister
cynthia
was
with
him
and
parker
saw
that
she
turned
from
the
window
and
that
she
was
crying
quietly
she
put
her
hand
on
the
boy
shoulder
and
patted
it
with
a
forlorn
gesture
which
to
the
foreman
eye
was
as
graceful
as
it
was
sad
he
moved
closer
to
bud
and
his
big
hand
fell
on
cynthia
brother
other
shoulder
as
he
realized
that
red
hair
could
look
pretty
sometimes
and
he
wondered
why
the
editor
singing
made
cynthy
cry
and
at
the
same
time
he
decided
to
be
mighty
good
to
bud
henceforth
the
spell
of
night
and
song
was
on
him
that
and
something
more
for
it
is
a
strange
inexplicable
fact
that
the
most
practical
chief
ever
known
to
the
herald
had
a
singularly
sentimental
influence
over
her
subordinates
from
the
moment
of
her
arrival
under
harkless
domination
there
had
been
no
more
steadfast
bachelors
in
carlow
than
ross
schofield
and
caleb
parker
and
like
timorous
youths
in
a
graveyard
daring
and
mocking
the
ghosts
in
order
to
assuage
their
own
fears
they
had
so
jibed
and
jeered
at
the
married
state
that
there
was
talk
of
urging
the
minister
to
preach
at
them
but
now
let
it
be
recorded
that
at
the
moment
caleb
laid
his
hand
on
bud
other
shoulder
his
associate
schofield
was
enjoying
a
walk
in
the
far
end
of
town
with
a
widow
and
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
tipworthy
heart
also
was
no
longer
in
his
possession
though
as
it
was
after
eight
the
damsel
of
his
desire
had
probably
long
since
retired
to
her
couch
for
some
faint
light
on
the
cause
of
these
spells
we
must
turn
to
a
comment
made
by
the
invaluable
martin
some
time
afterward
referring
to
the
lady
to
whose
voice
he
was
now
listening
in
silence
which
shows
how
great
the
enthralling
of
her
voice
was
he
said
when
you
saw
her
or
heard
her
or
managed
to
be
around
any
where
she
was
why
if
you
could
git
up
no
hope
of
marryin
you
wanted
to
marry
lige
willetts
riding
idly
by
drew
rein
in
front
of
the
lighted
windows
and
listened
with
the
others
presently
he
leaned
from
his
horse
and
whispered
to
a
man
near
him
i
know
that
do
you
whispered
the
other
yes
he
and
i
heard
her
sing
it
the
night
he
was
so
yes
sir
it
by
is
it
it
a
seraphic
song
continued
lige
no
exclaimed
his
friend
then
shaking
his
head
he
sighed
well
it
mighty
the
song
was
suddenly
woven
into
laughter
in
the
unseen
chamber
and
the
lights
in
the
windows
went
out
and
a
small
lady
and
a
tall
lady
and
a
thin
old
man
all
three
laughing
and
talking
happily
came
down
and
drove
off
in
the
briscoe
buckboard
the
little
crowd
dispersed
quietly
lige
willetts
plucked
to
his
horse
and
cantered
away
to
overtake
the
buckboard
william
todd
took
his
courage
between
his
teeth
and
the
song
ringing
in
his
ears
made
a
desperate
resolve
to
call
upon
miss
bardlock
that
evening
in
spite
of
its
being
a
week
day
and
caleb
parker
gently
and
stammeringly
asked
cynthia
if
she
would
wait
till
he
shut
up
the
shop
and
let
him
walk
home
with
her
and
bud
soon
the
square
was
quiet
as
before
and
there
was
naught
but
peace
under
the
big
stars
of
july
that
day
the
news
had
come
that
harkless
after
weeks
of
alternate
improvement
and
relapse
hazardously
lingering
in
the
borderland
of
shadows
had
passed
the
crucial
point
and
was
convalescent
his
recovery
was
assured
but
from
their
first
word
of
him
from
the
message
that
he
was
found
and
was
alive
none
of
the
people
of
carlow
had
really
doubted
it
they
are
simple
country
people
and
they
know
that
god
is
good
chapter
xv
nettles
two
men
who
have
been
comrades
and
classmates
at
the
alma
mater
of
john
harkless
and
tom
meredith
two
who
have
belonged
to
the
same
dub
and
roomed
in
the
same
entry
who
have
pooled
their
clothes
and
money
in
a
common
stock
for
either
to
draw
on
who
have
shared
the
fortunes
of
athletic
war
triumphing
together
sometimes
with
an
intense
triumphancy
two
men
who
were
once
boys
getting
hazed
together
hazing
in
no
unkindly
fashion
in
their
turn
always
helping
each
other
to
stuff
brains
the
night
before
an
examination
and
to
blow
away
the
suffocating
statistics
like
foam
the
night
after
singing
wrestling
dancing
laughing
succeeding
together
through
the
four
kindest
years
of
life
two
such
brave
companions
meeting
in
the
after
years
are
touchingly
tender
and
caressive
of
each
other
but
the
tenderness
takes
the
shy
united
states
form
of
insulting
epithets
and
the
caresses
are
blows
if
john
harkless
had
been
in
health
uninjured
and
prosperous
tom
meredith
could
no
more
have
thrown
himself
on
his
knees
beside
him
and
called
him
old
friend
than
he
could
have
danced
on
the
one
day
they
thought
the
patient
sleeping
the
nurse
fanned
him
softly
and
meredith
had
stolen
in
and
was
sitting
by
the
cot
one
of
eyes
had
been
freed
of
the
bandage
and
when
tom
came
in
it
was
closed
but
by
and
by
meredith
became
aware
that
the
unbandaged
eye
had
opened
and
that
it
was
suffused
with
a
pathetic
moisture
yet
it
twinkled
with
a
comprehending
light
and
john
knew
that
it
was
his
old
tom
meredith
who
was
sitting
beside
him
with
the
air
of
having
sat
there
very
often
before
but
this
bald
young
man
not
without
elegance
yet
a
prosperous
burgher
for
all
that
was
the
slim
rollicking
broth
of
a
boy
whose
thick
auburn
hair
used
to
make
one
streak
of
flame
as
he
spun
around
the
bases
on
a
home
run
without
doubt
it
was
the
stupendous
fact
wrought
by
the
alchemy
of
seven
years
for
though
seven
years
be
a
mere
breath
in
the
memories
of
the
old
it
is
a
long
transfiguration
to
him
whose
first
youth
is
passing
and
who
finds
unsolicited
additions
accruing
to
some
parts
of
his
being
and
strange
deprivations
in
others
and
upon
whom
the
unhappy
realization
begins
to
be
borne
in
that
his
is
no
particular
case
and
that
he
of
all
the
world
is
not
to
be
spared
but
like
his
forbears
must
inevitably
wriggle
in
the
disguising
crucible
of
time
and
though
men
accept
it
with
apparently
patient
humor
the
first
realization
that
people
do
grow
old
and
that
they
do
it
before
they
have
had
time
to
be
young
is
apt
to
come
like
a
shock
perhaps
not
even
in
the
interminable
months
of
carlow
had
harkless
realized
the
length
of
seven
years
so
keenly
as
he
did
when
he
beheld
his
old
friend
at
his
bedside
how
men
may
be
warped
apart
in
seven
years
especially
in
the
seven
years
between
and
thirty
at
the
latter
age
you
may
return
to
the
inseparable
of
seven
years
before
and
speak
not
the
same
language
you
find
no
heartiness
to
carry
on
with
each
other
after
half
an
hour
not
so
these
classmates
who
had
known
each
other
to
the
bone
ah
yes
it
was
tom
meredith
the
same
lad
in
spite
of
his
masquerade
of
flesh
and
helen
was
right
tom
had
not
forgotten
it
the
old
john
murmured
tremulously
you
go
plumb
to
thunder
answered
meredith
between
gulps
when
he
was
well
enough
they
had
long
talks
and
at
other
times
harkless
lay
by
the
window
and
breathed
deep
of
the
fresh
air
while
meredith
attended
to
his
correspondence
for
him
and
read
the
papers
to
him
but
there
was
one
phenomenon
of
literature
the
convalescent
insisted
upon
observing
for
himself
and
which
he
went
over
again
and
again
to
the
detriment
of
his
single
unswathed
eye
and
this
was
the
carlow
the
first
letter
he
had
read
to
him
was
one
from
fisbee
stating
that
the
crippled
forces
left
in
charge
had
found
themselves
almost
distraught
in
their
efforts
to
carry
on
the
paper
as
their
chief
might
conclude
for
himself
on
perusal
of
the
issues
of
the
first
fortnight
of
his
absence
and
they
had
made
bold
to
avail
themselves
of
the
services
of
a
young
relative
of
the
writer
from
a
distant
city
a
capable
journalist
who
had
no
other
employment
for
the
present
and
who
had
accepted
the
responsibilities
of
the
herald
temporarily
there
followed
a
note
from
parker
announcing
that
fisbee
relative
was
a
bird
and
was
the
kind
to
make
the
herald
hum
they
hoped
harkless
would
approve
of
their
bespeaking
the
new
hand
on
the
sheet
the
paper
must
have
suspended
otherwise
harkless
almost
overcome
by
his
surprise
that
fisbee
possessed
a
relative
dictated
a
hearty
and
grateful
indorsement
of
their
action
and
soon
after
received
a
typewritten
rejoinder
somewhat
complicated
in
the
reading
because
of
the
numerous
type
errors
and
their
corrections
the
missive
was
signed
h
fisbee
in
a
strapping
masculine
hand
that
suggested
six
feet
of
enterprise
and
muscle
spattering
ink
on
its
shirt
sleeves
john
groaned
and
fretted
over
the
writhings
of
the
herald
headless
fortnight
but
perusing
the
issues
produced
under
the
domination
of
fisbee
he
started
now
and
then
and
chuckled
at
some
shrewd
felicities
of
management
or
stared
puzzled
over
an
oddity
but
came
to
a
feeling
of
vast
relief
and
when
the
question
of
fisbee
salary
was
settled
and
the
tenancy
assured
he
sank
into
a
repose
of
mind
fisbee
might
be
an
eccentric
fellow
but
he
knew
his
business
and
apparently
he
knew
something
of
other
business
as
well
for
he
wrote
at
length
concerning
the
carlow
oil
fields
urging
harkless
to
take
shares
in
watts
company
while
the
stock
was
very
low
two
wells
having
been
sunk
without
satisfactory
results
fisbee
explained
with
exceeding
technicality
his
reasons
for
believing
that
the
third
well
would
strike
oil
but
with
his
ease
of
mind
regarding
the
herald
harkless
found
himself
possessed
by
apathy
he
fretted
no
longer
to
get
back
to
plattville
with
the
prospect
of
return
it
seemed
an
emptiness
glared
at
him
from
hollow
sockets
and
the
thought
of
the
dreary
routine
he
must
follow
when
he
went
back
gave
him
the
same
faint
nausea
he
had
felt
the
evening
after
the
circus
and
though
it
was
partly
the
long
sweat
of
anguish
which
had
benumbed
him
his
apathy
was
pierced
at
times
by
a
bodily
horror
of
the
scene
of
his
struggle
at
night
he
faced
the
grotesque
masks
of
the
men
and
the
brutal
odds
again
over
and
over
he
felt
the
blows
and
clapped
his
hand
to
where
the
close
fire
of
bob
skillett
pistol
burned
his
body
and
except
for
the
release
from
pain
he
rejoiced
less
and
less
in
his
recovery
he
remembered
a
tedious
sickness
of
his
childhood
and
how
beautiful
he
had
thought
the
world
when
he
began
to
get
well
how
electric
the
open
air
blowing
in
at
the
window
how
green
the
smile
of
earth
and
how
glorious
to
live
and
see
the
open
day
again
he
had
none
of
that
feeling
now
no
pretty
vision
came
again
near
his
bed
and
he
beheld
his
convalescence
as
a
mistake
he
had
come
to
a
place
in
his
life
why
had
they
not
let
him
jump
what
was
there
left
but
the
weary
plod
plod
and
dust
of
years
he
could
have
gone
back
to
carlow
in
better
spirit
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
few
dazzling
hours
of
companionship
which
had
transformed
it
to
a
paradise
but
gone
left
a
desert
she
by
the
sight
of
her
had
made
him
wish
to
live
and
now
that
he
saw
her
no
more
she
made
him
wish
to
die
how
little
she
had
cared
for
him
since
she
told
him
she
did
not
care
when
he
had
not
meant
to
ask
her
he
was
weary
and
at
last
he
longed
to
find
the
line
of
least
resistance
and
follow
it
he
had
done
hard
things
for
a
long
time
but
now
he
wanted
to
do
something
easy
under
the
new
genius
who
was
already
urging
that
the
paper
should
be
made
a
daily
the
herald
could
get
along
without
him
and
the
would
bother
carlow
no
longer
and
he
thought
that
kedge
halloway
an
honest
man
if
a
dull
one
was
sure
to
be
renominated
for
congress
at
the
district
convention
which
was
to
meet
at
plattville
in
september
these
were
his
responsibilities
and
they
did
not
fret
him
everything
was
all
right
there
was
only
one
thought
which
thrilled
him
his
impression
that
she
had
come
to
the
hospital
to
see
him
was
not
a
delusion
she
had
really
been
there
as
a
humane
christian
person
he
said
to
himself
one
day
he
told
meredith
of
his
vision
and
tom
explained
that
it
was
no
conjuration
of
fever
but
i
thought
she
gone
abroad
said
harkless
staring
they
had
planned
to
answered
his
friend
they
gave
it
up
for
some
reason
uncle
henry
decided
that
he
was
strong
enough
for
the
trip
or
then
is
she
is
she
here
no
helen
is
never
here
in
summer
when
she
came
back
from
plattville
she
went
north
somewhere
to
join
people
she
had
promised
i
meredith
had
as
yet
no
inkling
or
suspicion
that
his
adopted
cousin
had
returned
to
plattville
what
he
told
harkless
was
what
his
aunt
had
told
him
and
he
accepted
it
as
the
truth
sherwood
for
she
was
both
and
sherwood
had
always
considered
fisbee
an
enigmatic
rascal
and
she
regarded
defection
to
him
in
the
light
of
a
family
scandal
to
be
hushed
up
as
well
as
a
scalding
pain
to
be
borne
some
day
the
unkind
would
return
to
her
wisdom
and
her
duty
meanwhile
the
less
known
about
it
the
better
meredith
talked
very
little
to
harkless
of
his
cousin
beyond
lightly
commenting
on
the
pleasure
and
oddity
of
their
meeting
and
telling
him
of
her
friendly
anxiety
about
his
recovery
he
said
she
had
perfect
confidence
from
the
first
that
he
would
recover
harkless
had
said
a
word
or
two
in
his
delirium
and
a
word
or
two
out
of
it
and
these
with
once
a
sudden
brow
of
suffering
and
a
difference
meredith
felt
in
helen
manner
when
they
stood
together
by
the
sick
man
bedside
had
given
the
young
man
a
strong
impression
partly
intuitive
that
in
spite
of
the
short
time
the
two
had
known
each
other
something
had
happened
between
them
at
plattville
and
he
ventured
a
guess
which
was
not
far
from
the
truth
altogether
the
thing
was
fairly
plain
a
sad
lover
is
not
so
hard
to
read
and
meredith
was
sorry
for
they
were
the
two
people
he
liked
best
on
earth
the
young
man
carried
his
gay
presence
daily
to
the
hospital
where
harkless
now
lay
in
a
pleasant
room
of
his
own
and
he
tried
to
keep
his
friend
cheery
which
was
an
easy
matter
on
the
surface
for
the
journalist
turned
ever
a
mask
of
jokes
upon
him
but
it
was
not
hard
for
one
who
liked
him
as
meredith
did
to
see
through
to
the
melancholy
underneath
after
his
one
reference
to
helen
john
was
entirely
silent
of
her
and
meredith
came
to
feel
that
both
would
be
embarrassed
if
occasion
should
rise
and
even
her
name
again
be
mentioned
between
them
he
did
not
speak
of
his
family
connection
with
fisbee
to
the
invalid
for
although
the
connection
was
distant
the
old
man
was
in
a
way
the
family
skeleton
and
meredith
had
a
strong
sense
of
the
decency
of
reserve
in
such
a
matter
there
was
one
thing
fisbee
shame
had
made
the
old
man
unable
not
to
suppress
when
he
told
parker
his
story
the
wraith
of
a
torrid
palate
had
pursued
him
from
his
youth
and
the
days
of
drink
and
despair
from
which
harkless
had
saved
him
were
not
the
first
in
his
life
meredith
wondered
as
much
as
did
harkless
where
fisbee
had
picked
up
the
journalistic
young
relative
who
signed
his
extremely
missives
in
such
a
thundering
hand
it
was
evident
that
the
old
man
was
grateful
to
his
patron
but
it
did
not
occur
to
meredith
that
fisbee
daughter
might
have
an
even
stronger
sense
of
gratitude
one
so
strong
that
she
could
give
all
her
young
strength
to
work
for
the
man
who
had
been
good
to
her
father
there
came
a
day
in
august
when
meredith
took
the
convalescent
from
the
hospital
in
a
victoria
and
installed
him
in
his
own
home
clothes
hung
on
his
big
frame
limply
however
there
was
a
drift
of
light
in
his
eyes
as
they
drove
slowly
through
the
pretty
streets
of
rouen
the
bandages
and
splints
and
drugs
and
swathings
were
all
gone
now
and
his
sole
task
was
to
gather
strength
the
thin
face
was
sallow
no
longer
it
was
the
color
of
evening
shadows
indeed
he
lay
among
the
cushions
seemingly
no
more
than
a
gaunt
shadow
of
the
late
afternoon
looking
old
and
gray
and
weary
they
rolled
along
abusing
each
other
john
sometimes
gratefully
threatening
his
friend
with
violence
the
victoria
passed
a
stone
house
with
wide
lawns
and
an
inhospitable
air
of
wealth
and
importunate
rank
over
the
sward
two
peacocks
swung
ambulating
like
caravals
in
a
green
sea
and
one
expected
a
fine
lady
to
come
smiling
and
glittering
from
the
door
oddly
enough
though
he
had
never
seen
the
place
before
it
struck
harkless
with
a
sense
of
familiarity
who
lives
there
he
asked
abruptly
who
lives
there
on
the
left
why
that
that
is
the
sherwood
place
meredith
answered
in
a
tone
which
sounded
as
if
he
were
not
quite
sure
of
it
but
inclined
to
think
his
information
correct
harkless
relapsed
into
silence
meredith
home
was
a
few
blocks
further
up
the
same
street
a
capacious
house
in
the
western
fashion
of
the
seventies
in
front
on
the
lawn
there
was
a
fountain
with
a
leaping
play
of
water
maples
and
shrubbery
were
everywhere
and
here
and
there
stood
a
stiff
sentinel
of
lombardy
poplar
it
was
all
cool
and
incongruous
and
comfortable
and
on
the
porch
sheltered
from
publicity
by
a
multitude
of
palms
and
flowering
plants
a
negro
appeared
with
a
noble
smile
and
a
more
important
tray
whereon
tinkled
bedewed
glasses
and
a
crystal
pitcher
against
whose
sides
the
ice
clinked
sweetly
there
was
a
complement
of
straws
when
they
had
helped
him
to
an
easy
chair
on
the
porch
harkless
whistled
luxuriously
ah
my
bachelor
he
exclaimed
as
he
selected
a
straw
would
fardels
bear
rejoined
meredith
then
came
to
the
other
a
recollection
of
an
ball
player
on
whom
the
third
strike
had
once
been
called
while
his
eyes
wandered
tenderly
to
the
grandstand
where
the
prettiest
girl
of
that
commencement
week
was
sitting
have
you
forgot
the
princess
he
asked
you
a
dull
old
person
tom
laughed
have
you
discovered
that
they
who
forget
us
and
why
should
they
do
remember
well
anybody
except
just
us
two
i
mean
of
i
a
notion
we
do
the
other
set
his
glass
on
the
tray
and
lit
his
cigarette
yes
when
we
unsuccessful
then
i
think
we
that
may
be
of
course
it
is
if
a
lady
wishes
to
make
an
impression
on
me
that
is
worth
making
let
her
let
me
make
none
on
you
think
it
is
always
our
vanity
analyze
it
as
your
revered
thomas
does
and
you
shall
reach
the
same
conclusion
let
a
girl
reject
you
and
meredith
broke
off
cursing
himself
inwardly
and
rising
cried
gaily
what
profiteth
it
a
man
if
he
gain
the
whole
wisdom
in
regard
to
women
and
loseth
not
his
own
heart
and
neither
of
us
is
lacking
a
heart
though
it
may
be
one
tell
one
self
one
has
to
find
out
about
that
from
some
girl
at
least
i
rather
sure
of
mine
it
difficult
to
give
a
away
it
drugged
on
the
market
i
going
to
bring
out
the
dogs
spending
the
summer
at
home
just
to
give
them
daily
this
explanation
of
his
continued
presence
in
rouen
struck
john
as
quite
as
plausible
as
meredith
more
seriously
alleged
reasons
for
not
joining
his
mother
and
sister
at
winter
harbor
he
possessed
a
mother
and
as
he
explained
he
had
also
sisters
to
satiety
in
point
of
numbers
harkless
knew
that
tom
had
stayed
to
look
after
him
and
he
thought
there
never
was
so
poor
a
peg
as
himself
whereon
to
hang
the
warm
mantle
of
such
a
friendship
he
knew
that
other
mantles
of
affection
and
kindliness
hung
on
that
peg
for
he
had
been
moved
by
the
letters
and
visits
from
carlow
people
and
he
had
heard
the
story
of
their
descent
upon
the
hospital
and
of
the
march
on
the
many
a
good
fellow
too
had
come
to
see
him
during
his
better
days
from
judge
briscoe
openly
tender
and
solicitous
to
the
embarrassed
william
todd
who
fiddled
at
his
hat
and
explained
that
being
as
he
was
in
town
on
business
a
palpable
fiction
he
thought
look
in
to
see
if
they
was
any
word
would
wish
to
be
sent
down
to
our
the
good
will
the
sick
man
had
from
every
one
touched
him
and
made
him
feel
unworthy
and
he
could
see
nothing
he
had
done
to
deserve
it
meredith
could
and
would
not
openly
at
least
have
explained
to
him
that
it
made
not
a
great
deal
of
difference
what
he
did
it
was
what
people
thought
he
was
his
host
helped
him
upstairs
after
dinner
and
showed
him
the
room
prepared
for
his
occupancy
harkless
sank
sighing
with
weakness
into
a
deep
chair
and
meredith
went
to
a
and
stretched
himself
out
for
a
smoke
and
chat
does
it
beat
your
time
he
said
cheerily
to
think
of
become
of
all
the
old
boys
they
turn
up
so
differently
from
what
we
expected
when
they
turn
up
at
all
we
sized
them
up
all
right
so
far
as
character
goes
i
fancy
but
we
could
size
up
the
chances
of
life
take
poor
old
pickle
haines
who
have
dreamed
pickle
would
shoot
himself
over
a
bankruptcy
i
dare
say
that
was
all
of
it
might
have
been
cherchez
la
femme
do
you
think
what
do
you
make
of
case
john
there
was
no
answer
harkless
chair
was
directly
in
front
of
the
and
upon
the
carved
wooden
shelf
amongst
and
little
curios
cotillion
favors
and
the
like
there
were
scattered
a
number
of
photographs
one
of
these
was
that
of
a
girl
who
looked
straight
out
at
you
from
a
filigree
frame
there
was
hardly
a
corner
of
the
room
where
you
could
have
stood
without
her
clear
serious
eyes
seeming
to
rest
upon
yours
cherchez
la
femme
repeated
tom
puffing
unconsciously
pickle
was
a
good
fellow
but
he
had
the
deuce
of
an
eye
for
a
girl
do
you
remember
he
stopped
short
and
saw
the
man
and
the
photograph
looking
at
each
other
too
late
he
unhappily
remembered
that
he
had
meant
and
forgotten
to
take
that
photograph
out
of
the
room
before
he
brought
harkless
in
now
he
would
have
to
leave
it
and
helen
sherwood
was
not
the
sort
of
girl
even
in
a
flat
presentment
to
be
continually
thrown
in
the
face
of
a
man
who
had
lost
her
and
it
always
went
hard
tom
reflected
with
men
who
stretched
vain
hands
to
helen
only
to
lose
her
but
there
was
one
he
thought
whose
outstretched
hands
might
not
prove
so
vain
why
could
she
have
cared
for
john
harkless
deuce
take
the
girl
did
she
want
to
marry
an
emperor
he
looked
at
harkless
and
pitied
him
with
an
almost
tearful
compassion
a
feverish
color
dwelt
in
the
convalescent
cheek
the
apathy
that
had
dulled
his
eyes
was
there
no
longer
instead
they
burned
with
a
steady
fire
the
image
returned
his
unwavering
gaze
with
inscrutable
kindness
you
heard
that
pickle
shot
himself
did
you
meredith
asked
there
was
no
answer
john
did
not
hear
him
do
you
know
that
poor
jeny
haines
killed
himself
last
march
tom
said
sharply
there
was
only
silence
in
the
room
meredith
got
up
and
rattled
some
tongs
in
the
empty
fireplace
but
the
other
did
not
move
or
notice
him
in
any
way
meredith
set
the
tongs
down
and
went
quietly
out
of
the
room
leaving
his
friend
to
that
mysterious
interview
when
he
came
back
after
a
remorseful
cigarette
in
the
yard
harkless
was
still
sitting
motionless
looking
up
at
the
photograph
above
the
they
drove
abroad
every
day
at
first
in
the
victoria
and
as
harkless
strength
began
to
come
back
in
a
cart
of
tom
a
light
trail
of
blue
smoke
floating
back
wherever
the
two
friends
passed
and
though
the
country
editor
grew
stronger
in
the
pleasant
open
city
meredith
felt
that
his
apathy
and
listlessness
only
deepened
and
he
suspected
that
in
harkless
own
room
where
the
photograph
reigned
the
languor
departed
for
the
time
making
way
for
a
destructive
fire
judge
briscoe
paying
a
second
visit
to
rouen
told
tom
in
an
aside
that
their
friend
did
not
seem
to
be
the
same
man
he
was
altered
and
aged
beyond
belief
the
old
gentleman
whispered
sadly
meredith
decided
that
his
guest
needed
enlivening
something
to
take
him
out
of
himself
he
must
be
stirred
up
to
rub
against
people
once
more
and
therefore
one
night
he
made
a
little
company
for
him
two
or
three
apparently
betrothed
very
young
couples
for
whom
it
was
rather
dull
after
they
had
looked
their
fill
of
harkless
it
appeared
that
every
one
was
curious
to
see
him
and
three
or
four
married
young
couples
for
whom
the
entertainment
seemed
rather
diverting
in
an
way
they
had
the
air
of
remembering
that
they
had
forgotten
the
baby
and
three
or
four
bachelors
who
seemed
contented
in
any
place
where
they
were
allowed
to
smoke
and
one
widower
whose
manner
indicated
that
any
occasion
whatever
was
gay
enough
for
him
and
four
or
five
young
women
who
meredith
explained
to
john
were
of
their
host
age
and
had
been
left
over
out
of
the
set
he
grew
up
with
and
for
these
the
modest
party
took
on
a
hilarious
and
chipper
character
it
is
these
girls
that
have
let
the
men
go
by
because
they
did
see
any
good
enough
the
jolly
souls
the
one
widower
remarked
confidentially
been
at
it
a
long
while
and
they
know
how
and
they
as
robins
they
have
more
fun
than
people
who
have
all
of
these
lively
demoiselles
fluttered
about
harkless
with
commiserative
pleasantries
and
in
spite
of
his
protestations
made
him
recline
in
the
biggest
and
deepest
chair
on
the
porch
where
they
surfeited
him
with
kindness
and
grouped
about
him
with
extra
cushions
and
tenderness
for
a
man
who
had
been
injured
no
one
mentioned
the
fact
that
he
had
been
hurt
it
was
not
spoken
of
though
they
wished
mightily
he
would
tell
them
the
story
they
had
read
luridly
in
the
public
prints
they
were
very
good
to
him
one
of
them
in
particular
a
handsome
dark
girl
constituted
herself
at
once
his
cicerone
in
rouen
gossip
and
his
she
sat
by
him
and
saw
that
his
needs
and
his
too
were
supplied
and
oversupplied
she
could
not
let
him
move
and
anticipated
his
least
wish
though
he
was
now
amply
able
to
help
himself
and
she
fanned
him
as
if
he
were
a
dying
consumptive
they
sat
on
meredith
big
porch
in
the
late
twilight
and
ate
a
substantial
refection
and
when
this
was
finished
a
buzz
of
nonsense
rose
from
all
quarters
except
the
remote
corners
where
the
youthful
affianced
ones
had
defensively
stationed
themselves
behind
a
rampart
of
plants
they
having
eaten
had
naught
to
do
and
were
only
waiting
a
decent
hour
for
departure
laughing
voices
passed
up
and
down
the
street
and
mingled
with
the
rhythmic
plashing
of
meredith
fountain
and
beyond
the
shrubberies
and
fence
one
caught
glimpses
of
the
light
dresses
of
women
moving
to
and
fro
and
of
people
sitting
bareheaded
on
neighboring
lawns
to
enjoy
the
twilight
now
and
then
would
pass
with
pipe
and
dog
the
beflanneled
figure
of
an
undergraduate
home
for
vacation
or
a
trio
of
youths
in
knickerbockers
or
a
band
of
young
girls
or
both
trio
and
band
together
and
from
a
cross
street
near
by
came
the
calls
and
laughter
of
romping
children
and
the
pulsating
whirr
of
a
this
sound
harkless
remarked
as
a
ceaseless
accompaniment
to
life
in
rouen
even
in
the
middle
of
the
night
there
was
always
some
unfortunate
cutting
grass
when
the
daylight
was
all
gone
and
the
stars
had
crept
out
strolling
negroes
patrolled
the
sidewalks
thrumming
mandolins
and
guitars
and
others
came
and
went
singing
making
the
night
venetian
the
untrained
joyous
voices
chording
eerily
in
their
sweet
racial
minors
came
on
the
air
sometimes
from
far
away
but
there
swung
out
a
chorus
from
fresh
aryan
throats
in
the
house
south
of
meredith
where
oh
where
are
the
grave
old
seniors
safe
now
in
the
wide
wide
world
does
that
thrill
you

said
meredith
joining
the
group
about
harkless

what

a

on

north
and
soon
a
mixed
chorus
of
girls
and
boys
sang
from
there
o

waiting
waiting
alone

then
a
piano
across
the
street
sounded
the
dearthful
harmonies
of

meredith
flicking
a
spark
over
the
rail

my

said
the
lady
who
had
attached
herself
to
harkless

tapped
tom
shoulder
with
her
fan
and
smiled
graciously
corrective
thank
you

he
answered
gratefully
and
as
i
perhaps
had
better
say
since
otherwise
there
might
be
a
pause
and
i
am
the
host
we
have
a
wide
selection
in

to
what

sawish
scraped
vibration
of
catgut
pathetic
insistent
painstaking
and
painful
beyond
belief
he
is
in
a
terrible
way
said
the
widower
miss
hinsdale
laughed
worse
every
night
the
violinist
is
young
wetherford
swift
she
explained
to
harkless
he
is
very
much
in
love
and
it
does
agree
with
him
he
used
to
be
such
a
pleasant
boy
but
last
winter
he
went
quite
mad
over
helen
sherwood
cousin
our
beauty
you
know
i
am
so
sorry
she
is
here
you
be
interested
in
meeting
her
i
sure
and
he
took
up
the
it
is
said
that
his
family
took
up
chloroform
at
the
same
time
said
the
widower
his
music
is
a
barometer
continued
the
lady
and
by
it
the
neighborhood
nightly
observes
whether
miss
sherwood
has
been
nice
to
him
or
it
is
always
exceedingly
plaintive
explained
another
except
once
rejoined
miss
hinsdale
he
played
jigs
when
she
came
home
from
somewhere
or
other
in
it
was
tosti
me
die
the
very
next
evening
remarked
the
widower
ah
said
one
of
the
bachelors
but
his
joy
was
sadder
for
us
than
his
misery
hear
him
i
think
he
means
it
for
this
dull
town
to
me
observed
another
with
some
rancor
i
would
willingly
make
the
town
sufficiently
exciting
for
him
if
there
were
not
an
ordinance
against
the
hurling
of
missiles
finished
the
widower
the
piano
executing
the
funeral
march
ceased
to
execute
discomfited
by
the
persistent
and
overpowering
violin
the
banjo
and
the
were
given
over
even
the
collegians
music
was
defeated
and
the
neighborhood
was
forced
to
listen
to
the
dauntless
fiddle
but
not
without
protest
for
there
came
an
indignant
spoken
chorus
from
the
quarter
whence
the
college
songs
had
issued
wetherford
put
it
away
come
back
the
violin
played
on
we
all
know
each
other
here
you
see
harkless
miss
hinsdale
smiled
benignantly
they
did
bother
wetherford
swift
said
the
widower
not
that
time
do
you
hear
him
ye
come
back
to
me
douglas
oh
but
it
is
absence
that
is
killing
him
and
his
friends
cried
one
of
the
young
women
it
is
brainard
that
is
a
mistake
said
tom
meredith
as
easily
as
he
could
there
goes
jim
double
quartette
listen
and
you
will
hear
them
try
to
but
the
lady
who
had
mentioned
brainard
macauley
cried
indignantly
you
try
to
change
the
subject
the
moment
it
threatens
to
be
interesting
they
were
together
everywhere
until
the
day
she
went
away
they
danced
and
out
together
through
the
whole
of
one
party
they
drove
every
afternoon
they
took
long
walks
and
he
was
at
the
sherwoods
every
evening
of
her
last
week
in
town
is
a
mistake
i
afraid
it
looks
rather
bleak
for
wetherford
said
the
widower
i
went
up
to
the
office
on
business
one
day
and
there
sat
miss
sherwood
in
macauley
inner
temple
chatting
with
a
reporter
while
brainard
finished
some
helen
is
eccentric
said
the
former
speaker
but
she
not
quite
that
eccentric
unless
they
were
engaged
it
is
well
understood
that
they
will
announce
it
in
the
miss
hinsdale
kindly
explained
to
harkless
that
brainard
macauley
was
the
editor
of
the
rouen
morning
journal
a
very
distinguished
young
man
not
over
and
perfectly
already
a
power
to
be
accounted
with
in
national
politics
he
was
really
a
tremendous
success
and
sure
to
go
far
one
of
those
men
who
are
yet
so
strong
you
know
they
wo
let
the
lightning
hurt
it
really
looked
as
if
helen
sherwood
whom
harkless
really
ought
to
meet
had
actually
been
caught
in
the
toils
at
tet
those
toils
wherein
so
many
luckless
youths
had
lain
enmeshed
for
her
sake
he
must
meet
macauley
too
the
most
interesting
man
in
rouen
after
her
little
portrait
of
him
did
harkless
agree
that
it
looked
really
pretty
dull
for
miss
sherwood
other
lovers
harkless
smiled
and
agreed
that
it
did
indeed
she
felt
a
thrill
of
compassion
for
him
and
her
subsequent
description
of
the
pathos
of
his
smile
was
luminous
she
said
it
was
natural
that
a
man
who
had
been
through
so
much
suffering
from
those
horrible
should
have
a
smile
that
struck
into
your
heart
like
a
knife
despite
all
that
meredith
could
do
and
after
his
notorious
effort
to
shift
the
subject
he
could
do
very
little
the
light
prattle
ran
on
about
helen
sherwood
and
brainard
macauley
tom
abused
himself
for
his
wild
notion
of
cheering
his
visitor
with
these
people
who
had
no
talk
and
who
if
they
drifted
out
of
commonplace
froth
had
no
medium
to
float
them
unless
they
sailed
the
currents
of
local
personality
and
he
mentally
upbraided
them
for
a
set
of
gossiping
ninnies
they
conducted
a
conversation
if
it
could
be
dignified
by
a
name
of
which
no
stranger
could
possibly
partake
and
which
by
a
hideous
coincidence
was
making
his
friend
writhe
figuratively
speaking
for
harkless
sat
like
a
fixed
shadow
he
uttered
scarcely
a
word
the
whole
evening
though
meredith
knew
that
his
guests
would
talk
about
him
enthusiastically
the
next
day
none
the
less
the
journalist
silence
was
enforced
by
the
topics
but
what
expression
and
manner
the
light
allowed
them
to
see
was
friendly
and
receptive
as
though
he
listened
to
brilliant
suggestions
he
had
a
nice
courtesy
and
miss
hinsdale
felt
continually
that
she
was
cleverer
than
usual
this
evening
and
no
one
took
his
silence
to
be
churlish
though
they
all
innocently
wondered
why
he
did
not
talk
more
however
it
was
probable
that
a
man
who
had
been
so
interestingly
and
terribly
shot
would
be
rather
silent
for
a
time
afterward
that
night
when
harkless
had
gone
to
bed
meredith
sat
late
by
his
own
window
calling
himself
names
he
became
aware
of
a
rhomboidal
patch
of
yellow
light
on
a
wall
of
foliage
without
and
saw
that
it
came
from
his
friend
window
after
dubious
consideration
he
knocked
softly
on
the
door
he
went
in
harkless
was
in
bed
and
laughed
faintly
as
meredith
entered
i
i
fearing
you
have
to
let
me
settle
your
gas
bill
tom
i
not
like
i
used
to
be
quite
i
find
since
since
that
business
i
ca
sleep
without
a
light
i
rather
get
the
the
horrors
in
the
incoherently
meredith
made
a
compassionate
exclamation
and
turned
to
go
and
as
he
left
the
room
his
eye
fell
upon
the
the
position
of
the
photographs
had
been
altered
and
the
picture
of
the
girl
who
looked
straight
out
at
you
was
gone
the
mere
rim
of
it
was
visible
behind
the
image
of
an
old
gentleman
with
a
sardonic
mouth
an
hour
later
tom
came
back
and
spoke
through
the
closed
door
boy
do
you
think
you
can
get
to
sleep
now
yes
tom
it
all
right
you
get
to
bed
nothing
troubles
meredith
spent
the
next
day
in
great
tribulation
and
perplexity
he
felt
that
something
had
to
be
done
but
what
to
do
he
did
not
know
he
still
believed
that
a
was
what
harkless
needed
not
the
species
of
that
had
taken
place
last
night
but
a
diversion
which
would
divert
as
they
sat
at
dinner
a
suggestion
came
to
him
and
he
determined
to
follow
it
he
was
called
to
the
telephone
and
a
voice
strange
to
his
ear
murmured
in
a
tone
of
polite
deference
a
lady
wishes
to
know
if
meredith
and
his
visitor
intend
being
present
at
the
this
he
had
received
the
same
inquiry
from
miss
hinsdale
on
her
departure
the
previous
evening
and
had
answered
vaguely
hence
he
now
rejoined
you
are
quite
an
expert
ventriloquist
but
you
do
not
deceive
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
creaked
the
small
articulation
this
is
miss
hinsdale
is
it
no
sir
the
lady
wishes
to
know
if
you
will
kindly
answer
her
tell
her
he
hung
up
the
receiver
and
returned
to
the
table
some
of
clara
hinsdale
play
he
explained
you
made
a
devastating
impression
on
her
boy
you
were
wise
enough
not
to
talk
any
and
she
foolishly
thought
you
were
as
interesting
as
you
looked
we
going
out
to
a
dance
it
given
for
the
devotees
who
stay
here
all
summer
and
swear
rouen
is
always
cool
and
nobody
dances
but
me
and
the
very
young
ones
it
wo
be
so
bad
you
can
smoke
anywhere
and
there
are
little
tables
we
thank
you
tom
you
so
good
to
think
of
it
but
but
what
would
you
mind
going
alone
i
find
it
very
pleasant
sitting
on
your
veranda
or
i
get
a
very
well
if
you
do
want
to
go
i
do
i
have
had
a
dance
for
three
months
and
i
still
addicted
to
it
but
of
course
i
think
i
like
to
harkless
acquiesced
at
once
with
a
cheerful
voice
and
a
lifeless
eye
and
the
good
tom
felt
unaccountably
mean
in
persisting
they
drove
out
into
the
country
through
mists
like
lakes
and
found
themselves
part
of
a
procession
of
twinkling
and
cigar
sparks
shining
above
open
vehicles
winding
along
the
levels
like
a
canoe
fete
on
the
water
in
the
entrance
hall
of
the
they
encountered
miss
hinsdale
very
handsome
large
and
dark
elaborately
beaming
and
bending
toward
them
warmly
who
do
you
think
is
here
she
said
gomez
ventured
meredith
helen
sherwood
she
cried
go
and
present
harkless
before
brainard
macauley
takes
her
away
to
some
chapter
xvi
pretty
marquise
the
two
friends
walked
through
a
sort
of
to
find
her
music
playing
a
swaying
crowd
bright
lights
bright
eyes
pretty
women
a
glimpse
of
dancers
footing
it
over
a
polished
floor
in
a
room
beyond
a
hundred
colors
flashing
and
changing
as
the
groups
shifted
before
the
eye
could
take
in
the
composition
of
the
picture
a
sudden
thrill
of
exhilaration
rioted
in
john
pulses
and
he
trembled
like
a
child
before
the
gay
disclosure
of
a
christmas
tree
meredith
swore
to
himself
that
he
would
not
have
known
him
for
the
man
of
five
minutes
agone
two
small
bright
red
spots
glowed
in
his
cheeks
he
held
himself
erect
with
head
thrown
back
and
shoulders
squared
and
the
idolizing
tom
thought
he
looked
as
a
king
ought
to
look
at
the
acme
of
power
and
dominion
miss
hinsdale
word
in
the
hallway
was
the
geniuses
touch
a
bent
gray
man
of
years
a
word
and
behold
the
great
john
harkless
the
youth
of
elder
days
ripened
to
his
prime
of
wisdom
and
strength
people
made
way
for
them
and
whispered
as
they
passed
it
had
been
years
since
john
harkless
had
been
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
of
butterfly
people
everything
seemed
unreal
or
like
a
ball
in
a
play
presently
the
curtain
would
fall
and
close
the
lights
and
laughter
from
his
view
leaving
only
the
echo
of
music
it
was
like
a
kaleidoscope
for
color
the
bouquets
of
crimson
or
white
or
pink
or
purple
the
profusion
of
pretty
dresses
the
brilliant
tender
fabrics
and
the
handsome
foreshortened
faces
thrown
back
over
white
shoulders
in
laughter
glossy
raven
hair
and
fair
tresses
moving
in
quick
salutations
and
the
whole
gay
shimmer
of
festal
tints
and
rich
artificialities
set
off
against
the
brave
green
of
for
the
walls
were
solidly
adorned
with
forest
branches
with
here
and
there
amongst
them
a
droop
of
beech
leaves
stabbed
in
first
skirmish
with
summer
the
night
was
cool
and
the
air
full
of
flower
smells
while
harp
violin
and
sent
a
through
it
all
they
looked
rapidly
through
several
rooms
and
failed
to
find
her
indoors
and
they
went
outside
not
exchanging
a
word
and
though
harkless
was
a
little
lame
tom
barely
kept
up
with
his
long
stride
on
the
verandas
there
were
fairy
lamps
and
colored
incandescents
over
little
tables
where
people
sat
chatting
she
was
not
there
beyond
was
a
terrace
where
a
myriad
of
oriental
lanterns
outlined
themselves
clearly
in
fantastically
shaped
planes
of
scarlet
and
orange
and
green
against
the
blue
darkness
many
couples
and
groups
were
scattered
over
the
terrace
and
the
young
men
paused
on
the
steps
looking
swiftly
from
group
to
group
she
was
not
there
we
have
looked
in
the
said
tom
looking
at
his
companion
rather
sorrowfully
john
turned
quickly
and
they
reentered
the
house
he
had
parted
from
her
in
the
blackness
of
storm
with
only
the
flicker
of
lightning
to
show
her
to
him
but
it
was
in
a
blaze
of
lights
that
he
saw
her
again
the
dance
was
just
ended
and
she
stood
in
a
wide
doorway
half
surrounded
by
pretty
girls
and
young
men
who
were
greeting
her
he
had
one
full
look
at
her
she
was
leaning
to
them
all
her
arms
full
of
flowers
and
she
seemed
the
radiant
centre
of
all
the
light
and
gaiety
of
the
place
even
meredith
stopped
short
and
exclaimed
upon
her
for
one
never
got
used
to
her
and
he
remembered
that
whenever
he
saw
her
after
absence
the
sense
of
her
beauty
rushed
over
him
anew
and
he
believed
the
feeling
on
this
occasion
was
keener
than
ever
before
for
she
was
prettier
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
no
wonder
he
cried
but
harkless
did
not
understand
as
they
pressed
forward
meredith
perceived
that
they
were
only
two
more
radii
of
a
circle
of
youths
sprung
from
every
direction
as
the
waltz
ended
bearing
down
upon
the
common
focus
to
secure
the
next
dance
harkless
saw
nothing
but
that
she
stood
there
before
him
he
feared
a
little
that
every
one
might
notice
how
he
was
trembling
and
he
was
glad
of
the
many
voices
that
kept
them
from
hearing
his
heart
knock
against
his
ribs
she
saw
him
coming
toward
her
and
nodded
to
him
pleasantly
in
just
the
fashion
in
which
she
was
bowing
to
half
a
dozen
others
and
at
that
a
pang
of
hot
pain
went
through
him
like
an
arrow
an
arrow
poisoned
with
cordial
casual
friendliness
she
extended
her
hand
to
him
and
gave
him
a
smile
that
chilled
him
it
was
so
conventionally
courteous
and
poised
so
nicely
in
the
manner
of
society
he
went
hot
and
cold
fast
enough
then
for
not
less
pleasantly
in
that
manner
did
she
exclaim
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
harkless
so
extremely
glad
and
so
delighted
to
find
you
looking
strong
again
do
tell
me
about
all
our
friends
in
plattville
i
should
like
to
have
a
little
chat
with
you
some
time
so
good
of
you
to
find
me
in
this
and
with
that
she
turned
from
the
poor
fellow
to
meredith
how
do
you
do
cousin
tom
i
saved
the
next
dance
for
then
she
distributed
words
here
and
there
and
everywhere
amongst
the
circle
about
her
pretty
marquise
with
a
vengeance
no
mr
swift
i
shall
not
make
a
card
you
must
come
at
the
beginning
of
a
dance
if
you
want
one
i
can
not
promise
the
next
it
is
quite
impossible
no
i
did
not
go
as
far
north
as
mackinac
how
do
you
do
mr
burlingame
yes
quite
an
age
no
not
the
next
i
am
afraid
nor
the
next
i
not
keeping
a
card
good
evening
baird
no
not
the
next
oh
you
miss
hinsdale
no
mr
swift
it
is
quite
impossible
i
so
sorry
cousin
the
music
is
commencing
this
is
as
she
took
meredith
arm
she
handed
her
flowers
to
a
gentleman
beside
her
with
the
slightest
glance
at
the
recipient
and
the
gesture
and
look
made
her
partner
heartsick
for
his
friend
it
was
so
easy
and
natural
and
with
the
air
of
habit
and
had
so
much
of
the
manner
with
which
a
woman
hands
things
to
a
man
who
partakes
of
her
inner
confidences
tom
knew
that
harkless
divined
the
gesture
as
well
as
the
identity
of
the
gentleman
they
started
away
but
she
paused
and
turned
to
the
latter
mr
macauley
you
must
meet
harkless
we
leave
him
in
your
care
and
you
must
see
that
he
meets
all
the
pretty
girls
you
are
used
to
being
nice
to
distinguished
strangers
you
tom
put
his
arm
about
her
and
whirled
her
away
and
harkless
felt
as
if
a
soft
hand
had
dealt
him
blow
after
blow
in
the
face
was
this
lady
of
little
baffling
forms
and
small
cold
graces
the
girl
who
had
been
his
kind
comrade
the
girl
who
stood
with
him
by
the
blue
she
who
had
run
to
him
to
save
his
life
she
who
walked
at
his
side
along
the
pike
the
contrast
of
these
homely
scenes
made
him
laugh
grimly
was
this
she
who
had
wept
before
him
was
it
she
who
had
been
redolent
of
kindness
so
fragrantly
natural
and
true
was
it
she
who
said
she
loved
all
these
people
very
much
in
spite
of
having
known
them
only
two
days
he
cried
out
upon
himself
for
a
fool
what
was
he
in
her
eyes
but
a
man
who
had
needed
to
be
told
that
she
did
not
love
him
had
he
not
better
and
more
courteously
to
her
have
avoided
the
meeting
which
was
necessarily
an
embarrassment
to
her
but
no
he
must
rush
like
a
mohawk
till
he
found
her
and
forced
her
to
rebuff
him
to
veil
her
kindness
in
little
manners
to
remind
him
that
he
put
himself
in
the
character
of
a
rejected
importunate
she
had
punished
him
enough
perhaps
a
little
too
cruelly
enough
in
leaving
him
with
the
man
to
whom
she
handed
bouquets
as
a
matter
of
course
and
this
man
was
one
whose
success
had
long
been
a
trumpet
at
his
ear
blaring
loudly
of
his
own
failure
in
the
same
career
it
had
been
several
years
since
he
first
heard
of
the
young
editor
of
the
rouen
journal
and
nowadays
almost
everybody
knew
about
brainard
macauley
outwardly
he
was
of
no
unusual
type
an
american
of
affairs
slight
easy
yet
alert
relaxed
yet
sharp
neat
regular
strong
a
quizzical
eye
a
business
chin
an
ambitious
head
with
soft
straight
hair
outlining
a
square
brow
and
though
he
was
of
a
type
he
was
not
commonplace
and
one
knew
at
once
that
he
would
make
a
rattling
fight
to
arrive
where
he
was
going
it
appeared
that
he
had
heard
of
harkless
as
well
as
the
carlow
editor
of
him
they
had
a
few
moments
of
shop
and
he
talked
to
harkless
as
a
brother
craftsman
without
the
offense
of
graciousness
and
spoke
of
his
pleasure
in
the
meeting
and
of
his
relief
at
harkless
recovery
for
aside
from
the
mere
human
feeling
the
party
needed
him
in
carlow
even
if
he
did
not
always
prove
himself
quite
a
vehement
macauley
laughed
but
i
not
doing
my
duty
he
said
presently
i
was
to
present
you
to
the
pretty
ones
only
i
believe
will
you
designate
your
preferred
fashion
of
beauty
we
serve
all
thank
you
the
other
answered
hurriedly
i
met
a
number
last
night
quite
a
number
he
had
seen
them
only
in
dim
lights
however
and
except
miss
hinsdale
and
the
widower
had
not
the
faintest
recognition
of
any
of
them
and
he
cut
them
all
except
those
two
one
after
the
other
before
the
evening
was
over
and
this
was
a
strange
thing
for
a
politician
to
do
but
he
did
it
with
such
an
innocent
eye
that
they
remembered
the
dark
porch
and
forgave
him
shall
we
watch
the
dancing
then
asked
macauley
harkless
was
already
watching
part
of
it
if
you
will
i
have
not
seen
this
sort
for
more
than
five
it
is
always
a
treat
i
think
and
a
constant
proof
that
the
older
school
of
english
caricaturists
did
yes
one
realizes
they
harkless
remembered
tom
meredith
fine
accomplishment
of
dancing
he
had
been
the
most
famous
dancer
of
college
days
and
it
was
in
the
dancer
that
john
best
saw
his
old
friend
again
as
he
had
known
him
the
light
lad
of
the
active
toe
other
couples
flickered
about
the
one
john
watched
couples
that
plodded
couples
that
bobbed
couples
that
galloped
couples
that
slid
but
the
cousins
alone
passed
across
the
glistening
reflections
as
lightly
as
october
leaves
blown
over
the
forest
floor
in
the
midst
of
people
who
danced
with
fixed
glassy
eyes
or
who
frowned
with
determination
to
do
their
duty
or
to
die
and
seemed
to
expect
the
latter
or
who
were
pale
with
the
apprehension
of
collision
or
who
made
visible
their
anxiety
to
breathe
through
the
nose
and
look
pleased
at
the
same
time
these
two
floated
and
smiled
easily
upon
life
three
or
four
steep
steps
made
the
portly
and
meredith
pant
like
an
old
man
but
a
dance
was
a
cooling
draught
to
him
as
for
the
little
marquise
when
she
danced
she
danced
away
with
all
those
luckless
hearts
that
were
not
hers
already
the
orchestra
launched
the
jubilant
measures
of
the
with
a
torrent
of
vivacity
and
the
girl
rhythmic
flight
answered
like
a
sail
taking
the
breeze
there
was
one
heart
she
had
long
since
won
which
answered
her
every
movement
flushed
rapturous
eyes
sparkling
cheeks
aglow
the
small
head
weaving
through
the
throng
like
a
golden
shuttle
ah
did
she
know
how
adorable
she
was
was
tom
right
is
it
the
attainable
unattainable
to
one
man
and
given
to
some
other
that
leaves
a
deeper
mark
upon
him
than
success
at
all
events
the
unattainable
was
now
like
a
hot
sting
in
the
heart
but
yet
a
sting
more
precious
than
a
balm
the
voice
of
brainard
macauley
broke
in
a
white
brow
and
a
long
lash
a
flushing
cheek
and
a
soft
eye
a
voice
that
laughs
and
breaks
and
ripples
in
the
middle
of
a
word
a
girl
you
could
put
in
your
hat
harkless
and
there
you
have
a
strong
man
prone
but
i
congratulate
you
on
the
manner
your
subordinates
operate
the
during
your
absence
i
understand
you
are
making
it
a
macauley
was
staring
at
him
quizzically
and
harkless
puzzled
but
without
resentment
of
the
other
whimsey
could
only
decide
that
the
editor
of
the
rouen
journal
was
an
exceedingly
odd
young
man
all
at
once
he
found
meredith
and
the
girl
herself
beside
him
they
had
stopped
before
the
dance
was
finished
he
had
the
impulse
to
guard
himself
from
new
blows
as
a
boy
throws
up
his
elbow
to
ward
a
buffet
and
although
he
could
not
ward
with
his
elbow
for
his
heart
was
on
his
sleeve
where
he
began
to
believe
that
macauley
had
seen
it
he
remembered
that
he
could
smile
with
as
much
intentional
mechanism
as
any
wornout
rounder
of
afternoons
he
stepped
aside
for
her
and
she
saw
what
she
had
known
but
had
not
seen
before
for
the
thickness
of
the
crowd
and
this
was
that
he
limped
and
leaned
upon
his
stick
do
let
me
thank
you
he
said
with
a
louder
echo
of
her
manner
of
greeting
him
a
little
earlier
it
has
been
such
a
pleasure
to
watch
you
dance
it
is
really
charming
to
meet
you
here
if
i
return
to
plattville
i
shall
surely
remember
to
tell
miss
at
this
she
surprised
him
with
a
sudden
clear
look
in
the
eyes
so
reproachful
so
deep
so
sad
that
he
started
she
took
her
flowers
from
macauley
who
had
the
air
of
understanding
the
significance
of
such
ceremonies
very
well
and
saying
sha
we
all
go
out
on
the
terrace
placed
her
arm
in
harkless
and
conducted
him
and
not
the
others
to
the
most
secluded
corner
of
the
terrace
a
nook
illumined
by
one
japanese
lantern
to
which
spot
it
was
his
belief
that
he
led
her
she
sank
into
a
chair
with
the
look
of
the
girl
who
had
stood
by
the
blue
he
could
only
stare
at
her
amazed
by
her
abrupt
change
to
this
dazzling
if
reproachful
kindness
confused
by
his
good
fortune
you
go
back
to
plattville
she
said
in
a
low
voice
what
do
you
mean
i
do
know
i
been
dull
lately
and
i
thought
i
might
go
somewhere
caught
in
a
witchery
no
lack
of
possession
could
dispel
and
which
the
prospect
of
loss
made
only
stronger
while
it
lasted
he
took
little
thought
of
what
he
said
little
thought
of
anything
but
of
the
gladness
it
was
to
be
with
her
again
else
where
have
you
no
sense
of
responsibility
what
is
to
become
of
your
paper
the
oh
it
will
potter
along
i
but
what
has
become
of
it
in
your
absence
already
has
it
not
deteriorated
very
much
no
he
said
it
better
than
it
ever
was
what
she
cried
with
a
little
gasp
you
so
astounded
at
my
modesty
but
please
tell
me
what
you
mean
she
said
quickly
what
happened
to
it
is
the
rather
a
dull
subject
i
tell
you
how
well
judge
briscoe
looked
when
he
came
to
see
me
or
rather
tell
me
of
your
summer
in
the
no
she
answered
earnestly
do
you
remember
my
telling
you
that
i
am
interested
in
newspaper
work
i
have
even
heard
so
from
others
he
said
with
an
instant
of
dryness
please
tell
me
about
the
it
is
very
simple
your
friend
fisbee
found
a
substitute
a
relative
six
feet
high
with
his
coat
off
a
traction
engine
for
energy
and
a
limited
mail
for
speed
he
writes
me
letters
on
a
type
writer
suffering
from
an
impediment
in
its
speech
and
in
brief
he
is
an
enterprising
idiot
with
a
mania
for
her
face
was
in
the
shadow
you
say
the
idiot
is
enterprising
she
inquired
far
more
enterprising
and
far
less
idiot
than
i
they
are
looking
for
oil
down
there
and
when
he
came
he
knew
less
about
oil
than
a
kindergarten
babe
and
spoke
of
for
kerosene
in
his
first
letter
to
me
but
he
knows
it
all
now
and
writes
long
and
convincing
geological
arguments
if
a
well
comes
in
he
is
prepared
to
get
out
an
extra
perhaps
you
may
understand
what
that
means
in
plattville
with
the
numerous
forces
i
owe
him
everything
even
the
shares
in
the
oil
company
which
he
has
persuaded
me
to
take
and
he
is
going
to
dare
to
make
the
a
daily
do
you
remember
asking
me
why
i
had
never
done
that
it
seemed
rather
a
venture
to
try
to
compete
with
the
rouen
papers
in
offering
state
and
foreign
news
but
this
young
gulliver
has
tacked
onto
the
associated
press
and
means
to
print
a
quarto
that
eight
pages
you
know
once
a
week
saturday
and
a
double
sheet
four
pages
on
other
mornings
the
daily
venture
begins
next
will
it
succeed
oh
no
he
laughed
you
think
not
her
interest
in
this
dull
business
struck
him
as
astonishing
and
yet
in
character
with
her
as
he
had
known
her
in
plattville
then
he
wondered
unhappily
if
she
thought
that
talking
of
the
herald
and
learning
things
about
the
working
of
a
country
newspaper
would
help
her
to
understand
brainard
macauley
why
have
you
let
him
go
on
with
it
she
asked
i
suppose
you
have
encouraged
him
oh
yes
i
encouraged
him
the
creature
recklessness
fascinated
me
a
like
that
is
always
charming
you
think
there
is
no
chance
for
the
creature
succeeding
with
the
daily
none
he
replied
indifferently
you
mentioned
i
think
he
laughed
again
i
believe
him
to
be
the
original
man
once
a
week
he
produces
a
page
wherein
he
presents
to
the
carlow
female
public
three
methods
for
making
currant
jelly
three
receipts
for
the
concoction
of
salads
and
directs
the
ladies
how
to
manufacture
a
pretty
out
of
odd
scraps
in
twenty
minutes
the
astonishing
part
of
it
is
that
he
has
not
yet
been
mobbed
by
the
women
who
have
followed
his
so
you
think
the
daily
is
a
mistake
and
that
your
enterprising
idiot
should
be
mobbed
why
she
seemed
to
be
taking
him
very
seriously
i
think
he
may
be
for
his
page
it
is
all
wrong
you
think
what
could
a
yankee
cousin
of
old
fisbee
know
about
currant
jelly
and
you
know
about
currant
jelly
and
yourself
heaven
defend
the
right
i
do
not
you
are
sure
he
is
six
feet
you
should
see
his
signature
that
leaves
no
doubt
and
also
his
ability
denotes
his
you
believe
that
ability
is
in
proportion
to
height
do
you
not
there
was
a
dangerous
luring
in
her
tone
his
memory
recalled
to
him
that
he
was
treading
on
undermined
ground
so
he
hastened
to
say
in
inverse
then
your
substitute
is
a
failure
i
see
she
said
slowly
what
muffled
illumination
there
was
in
their
nook
fell
upon
his
face
her
back
was
toward
it
so
that
she
was
only
an
outline
to
him
and
he
would
have
been
startled
and
touched
to
the
quick
could
he
have
known
that
her
lip
quivered
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
she
spoke
the
last
words
he
was
happy
as
he
had
not
been
since
his
short
june
day
it
was
enough
to
be
with
her
again
nothing
not
even
brainard
macauley
could
dull
his
delight
and
besides
for
a
few
minutes
he
had
forgotten
brainard
macauley
what
more
could
man
ask
than
to
sit
in
the
gloom
with
her
to
know
that
he
was
near
her
again
for
a
little
while
and
to
talk
about
anything
if
he
talked
at
all
nonsense
and
idle
exaggeration
about
young
fisbee
would
do
as
well
as
another
thing
the
young
gentleman
is
an
exception
he
returned
i
told
you
i
owed
everything
to
him
my
gratitude
will
not
allow
me
to
admit
that
his
ability
is
less
than
his
stature
he
suggested
my
purchase
of
a
quantity
of
watts
oil
stock
when
it
was
knocked
flat
on
its
back
by
two
wells
turning
out
dry
but
if
watts
third
well
comes
in
and
young
fisbee
has
convinced
me
that
it
will
and
if
my
midas
extra
booms
the
stock
and
the
boom
develops
i
shall
oppose
the
income
tax
poor
old
plattville
will
be
full
of
strangers
and
speculators
and
the
will
advocate
vast
improvements
to
impress
the
investor
eye
stagnation
and
picturesqueness
will
flee
together
it
is
the
history
of
the
indiana
town
already
the
is
clamoring
with
henry
you
remember
the
for
main
street
to
be
asphalted
it
will
all
come
the
only
trouble
with
young
fisbee
is
that
he
has
too
much
and
yet
the
daily
will
not
succeed
no
that
too
big
a
jump
unless
my
young
man
expressions
on
the
tariff
command
a
wide
sale
amongst
then
he
is
quite
a
fool
about
political
matters
far
from
it
he
is
highly
ingenious
his
editorials
are
often
the
subtlest
cups
of
flattery
i
ever
sipped
many
of
them
showing
assiduous
study
of
old
files
to
master
the
method
and
notions
of
his
predecessor
but
the
tariff
seems
to
have
got
him
he
is
a
very
masculine
person
except
for
this
one
feminine
quality
for
if
i
may
say
it
without
ungallantry
there
is
a
legend
that
no
woman
has
ever
understood
the
tariff
young
fisbee
must
be
an
extremely
travelled
person
because
the
people
have
made
an
impression
upon
him
which
no
few
encounters
with
them
could
explain
and
he
conceives
the
tariff
to
be
a
law
which
discommodes
a
lady
who
has
been
purchasing
gloves
in
paris
he
thinks
smuggling
the
great
evil
of
the
present
tariff
system
it
is
such
a
temptation
so
insidious
a
of
moral
fibre
his
views
must
edify
she
gave
a
quick
stifled
cry
oh
there
is
a
word
of
truth
in
what
you
say
not
a
word
i
did
not
think
you
could
be
so
cruel
he
bent
forward
peering
at
her
in
astonishment
cruel
you
know
it
is
a
hateful
distortion
an
exaggeration
she
exclaimed
passionately
no
man
living
could
have
so
little
sense
as
you
say
he
has
the
tariff
is
perfectly
plain
to
any
child
when
you
were
in
plattville
you
were
like
this
i
did
know
you
were
unkind
i
i
do
understand
please
miss
hinsdale
has
been
talking
raving
to
me
about
you
you
may
not
know
it
though
i
suppose
you
do
but
you
made
a
conquest
last
night
it
seems
a
little
hard
on
the
poor
young
man
who
is
at
work
for
you
in
plattville
doing
his
best
for
you
plodding
on
through
the
hot
days
and
doing
all
he
knows
how
while
you
sit
listening
to
music
in
the
evenings
with
clara
hinsdale
and
make
a
mock
of
his
work
and
his
trying
to
please
you
but
i
did
mention
him
to
miss
hinsdale
in
fact
i
did
mention
to
miss
hinsdale
what
have
i
done
the
young
man
is
making
his
living
by
his
work
and
my
living
too
for
that
matter
it
only
seems
to
me
that
his
tariff
editorials
are
rather
she
laughed
suddenly
ringingly
of
course
they
are
how
should
i
know
immensely
humorous
and
the
good
creature
knows
nothing
beyond
smuggling
and
the
and
chalk
marks
why
even
ha
ha
ha
even
should
have
known
better
than
that
what
a
little
fool
your
enterprising
idiot
must
be
with
his
and
currant
jelly
and
his
trying
to
make
the
a
daily
it
will
be
a
ludicrous
failure
of
course
no
doubt
he
thought
he
was
being
quite
wise
and
was
pleased
over
his
tariff
editorials
his
funny
funny
editorials
his
best
to
please
you
ha
ha
ha
how
immensely
funny
do
you
know
him
he
asked
abruptly
i
have
not
the
honor
of
the
gentleman
acquaintance
ah
she
rejoined
bitterly
i
see
what
you
mean
it
is
the
old
accusation
is
it
i
am
a
woman
and
i
the
personal
note
i
could
not
resent
a
cruelty
for
the
sake
of
a
man
i
do
not
know
but
let
it
go
my
resentment
is
personal
after
all
since
it
is
against
a
man
i
do
know
he
leaned
toward
her
because
he
could
not
help
it
i
rather
have
resentment
from
you
than
then
i
will
give
you
nothing
she
answered
quickly
you
flout
me
he
cried
that
is
better
than
i
hate
you
most
i
think
she
said
with
a
tremulousness
he
did
not
perceive
when
you
say
you
do
not
care
to
go
back
to
did
i
say
it
it
is
in
every
word
and
it
is
true
you
do
care
to
go
back
yes
it
is
true
i
you
want
to
leave
the
place
where
you
do
good
to
leave
those
people
who
love
you
who
were
ready
to
die
to
avenge
your
hurt
she
exclaimed
vehemently
oh
i
say
that
is
shameful
yes
i
know
he
returned
gravely
i
am
do
say
that
she
cried
do
say
you
are
ashamed
of
it
do
you
suppose
i
do
not
understand
the
dreariness
it
has
been
for
you
you
know
that
i
see
it
is
a
horror
to
you
that
it
brings
back
your
struggle
with
those
beasts
in
the
dark
and
revivifies
all
your
suffering
merely
to
think
of
it
her
turns
and
sudden
contradictions
left
him
tangled
in
a
maze
he
could
not
follow
but
must
sit
helpless
to
keep
pace
with
her
while
the
sheer
happiness
of
being
with
her
tingled
through
his
veins
she
rose
and
took
a
step
aside
then
spoke
again
well
since
you
want
to
leave
carlow
you
shall
since
you
do
not
wish
to
return
you
need
are
you
laughing
at
me
she
leaned
toward
him
and
looked
at
him
steadily
with
her
face
close
to
his
he
was
not
laughing
his
eyes
shone
with
a
deep
fire
in
that
nearness
he
hardly
comprehended
what
she
said
thank
you
for
not
laughing
she
whispered
and
leaned
back
from
him
i
suppose
you
think
my
promises
are
quite
wild
and
they
are
i
do
not
know
what
i
was
talking
about
or
what
i
meant
any
better
than
you
do
you
may
understand
some
day
it
is
all
i
mean
that
it
hurts
one
to
hear
you
say
you
do
not
care
for
she
turned
away
where
it
is
my
turn
to
conclude
the
interview
you
remember
the
last
time
it
was
you
who
she
broke
off
shuddering
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
ah
that
she
exclaimed
i
did
not
think
i
did
not
mean
to
speak
of
that
miserable
miserable
night
and
to
be
harsh
with
you
for
not
caring
to
go
back
to
carlow
your
harshness
he
laughed
a
waft
of
we
must
go
she
said
he
did
not
move
but
sat
staring
at
her
like
a
thirsty
man
drinking
with
an
impulsive
and
pretty
gesture
she
reached
out
her
hand
to
him
her
little
white
glove
trembled
in
the
night
before
his
eyes
and
his
heart
leaped
to
meet
its
sudden
sweet
generosity
his
thin
fingers
closed
over
it
as
he
rose
and
then
that
hand
he
had
likened
to
a
white
butterfly
lay
warm
and
light
and
quiet
in
his
own
and
as
they
had
so
often
stood
together
in
their
short
day
and
their
two
nights
of
the
moon
so
now
again
they
stood
with
a
serenading
silence
between
them
a
plaintive
from
the
house
ran
through
the
blue
woof
of
starlit
air
as
a
thread
through
the
tapestry
of
night
they
heard
the
mellow
croon
of
the
and
the
silver
plaints
of
violins
the
chiming
harp
and
the
triangle
bells
all
woven
into
a
minor
strain
of
that
beat
gently
upon
their
ears
with
such
suggestion
of
the
past
that
as
by
some
witchcraft
of
hearing
they
listened
to
music
made
for
lovers
dancing
and
lovers
listening
a
hundred
years
ago
i
care
for
only
one
thing
in
this
world
he
said
tremulously
have
i
lost
it
i
did
mean
to
ask
you
that
last
night
although
you
answered
have
i
no
chance
is
it
still
the
same
do
i
come
too
late
the
butterfly
fluttered
in
his
hand
and
then
away
she
drew
back
and
looked
at
him
a
moment
there
is
one
thing
you
must
always
understand
she
said
gently
and
that
is
that
a
woman
can
be
grateful
i
give
you
all
the
gratitude
there
is
in
me
and
i
think
i
have
a
great
deal
it
is
all
yours
will
you
always
remember
that
gratitude
what
can
there
you
do
not
understand
now
but
some
day
you
will
i
ask
you
to
remember
that
my
every
act
and
thought
which
bore
reference
to
you
and
there
have
been
many
came
from
the
purest
gratitude
although
you
do
not
see
it
now
will
you
promise
to
believe
it
yes
he
said
simply
for
the
rest
she
paused
for
the
rest
i
do
not
love
he
bowed
his
head
and
did
not
lift
it
do
you
understand
she
asked
i
understand
he
answered
quietly
she
looked
at
him
long
and
then
suddenly
her
hand
to
her
heart
gave
a
little
pitying
tender
cry
and
moved
toward
him
at
this
he
raised
his
head
and
smiled
sadly
no
do
you
mind
he
said
it
all
right
i
was
such
a
cad
the
other
time
i
needed
to
be
told
i
was
so
entirely
silly
about
it
i
could
face
the
others
to
tell
them
and
i
left
you
out
there
to
go
in
to
them
alone
i
realize
for
my
manners
were
all
gone
i
lived
in
a
kind
of
stupor
i
think
for
a
long
time
then
being
with
you
was
like
a
dream
and
the
sudden
waking
was
too
much
for
me
i
been
ashamed
often
since
in
thinking
of
it
and
i
was
well
punished
for
not
taking
you
in
i
thought
only
of
myself
and
i
behaved
like
a
whining
unbalanced
boy
but
i
had
whined
from
the
moment
i
met
you
because
i
was
sickly
with
egoism
and
loneliness
and
i
keeping
you
from
the
dancing
wo
you
let
me
take
you
back
to
the
house
a
commanding
and
querulous
contralto
voice
was
heard
behind
them
and
a
dim
majestic
figure
appeared
under
the
japanese
lantern
helen
the
girl
turned
quickly
yes
may
i
ask
you
to
return
to
the
for
supper
with
me
your
father
has
been
very
much
worried
about
you
we
have
all
been
looking
for
mamma
this
is
how
do
you
do
the
lady
murmured
this
much
so
far
under
her
breath
that
the
words
might
have
been
mistaken
for
anything
else
most
plausibly
perhaps
for
who
cares
if
it
is
nor
further
did
she
acknowledge
john
profound
inclination
frigidity
and
complaint
of
made
a
glamour
in
every
fold
of
her
expensive
garments
she
was
large
and
troubled
and
severe
a
second
figure
emerged
from
behind
her
and
bowed
with
the
suave
dignity
that
belonged
to
brainard
macauley
mr
macauley
has
asked
to
sit
at
our
table
sherwood
said
to
helen

i
beg

once

father

holding
places

she
answered
i
will

i
think
harkless
will
excuse
you
said
the
elder
lady
he
has
an
engagement
meredith
has
been
looking
everywhere
for
him
to
take
miss
hinsdale
out
to
miss
sherwood
said
john
in
a
cheerful
voice
i
thank
you
for
sitting
out
the
dance
with
she
said
and
gave
him
her
hand
i
so
sorry
i
see
you
again
i
am
only
in
rouen
for
this
evening
or
i
should
ask
you
to
come
to
see
me
i
am
leaving
morning
yes
the
three
figures
went
toward
the
bright
lights
of
the
she
was
leaning
on
macauley
arm
and
chatting
gaily
smiling
up
at
him
brightly
john
watched
her
till
she
was
lost
in
the
throng
on
the
veranda
there
in
the
lights
where
waiters
were
arranging
little
tables
every
one
was
talking
and
moving
about
noisily
and
happy
there
was
a
flourish
of
violins
and
then
the
orchestra
swung
into
a
rampant
march
that
pranced
like
uncurbed
cavalry
it
stirred
the
blood
of
old
men
with
militant
bugle
calls
and
blast
of
horns
it
might
have
heralded
the
chariot
of
a
flamboyant
war
god
rioting
out
of
sunrise
plumed
with
youth
some
quite
young
men
on
the
veranda
made
as
if
they
were
restive
horses
champing
at
the
bit
and
heading
a
procession
and
from
a
group
near
by
loud
laughter
pealed
john
harkless
lifted
to
his
face
the
hand
that
had
held
hers
there
was
the
faint
perfume
of
her
glove
he
kissed
his
own
hand
then
he
put
that
hand
and
the
other
to
his
forehead
and
sank
into
her
chair
let
me
get
back
he
said
let
me
get
back
to
plattville
where
i
tom
meredith
came
calling
him
harkless
john
harkless
here
i
am
come
along
boy
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
out
here
all
alone
i
thought
you
were
with
i
thought
some
people
were
with
you
bored
to
death
i
know
but
come
along
and
be
bored
some
more
because
i
promised
to
bring
you
in
for
supper
then
we
go
home
they
saved
a
place
for
you
by
miss
very
well
lad
answered
harkless
and
put
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
thank
the
next
day
he
could
not
leave
his
bed
his
wounds
were
feverish
and
his
weakness
had
returned
meredith
was
shaken
with
remorse
because
he
had
let
him
wander
around
in
the
damp
night
air
with
no
one
to
look
after
him
chapter
xvii
helen
toast
judge
briscoe
was
sitting
out
under
the
afternoon
sky
with
his
chair
tilted
back
and
his
feet
propped
against
the
steps
his
coat
was
off
and
minnie
sat
near
at
hand
sewing
a
button
on
the
garment
for
him
and
she
wore
that
dreamy
glaze
that
comes
over
women
eyes
when
they
sew
for
other
people
from
the
interior
of
the
house
rose
and
fell
the
murmur
of
a
number
of
voices
engaged
in
a
conversation
which
for
a
time
seemed
to
consist
of
dejected
monosyllables
but
presently
the
judge
and
minnie
heard
helen
voice
clear
soft
and
trembling
a
little
with
excitement
she
talked
only
two
or
three
minutes
but
what
she
said
stirred
up
a
great
commotion
all
the
voices
burst
forth
at
once
in
ejaculations
almost
shouts
but
presently
they
were
again
subdued
and
still
except
for
the
single
soft
one
which
held
forth
more
quietly
but
with
a
deeper
agitation
than
any
of
the
others
you
need
try
to
bamboozle
me
said
the
judge
in
a
covert
tone
to
his
daughter
and
with
a
glance
at
the
parlor
window
whence
now
issued
the
rumble
of
warren
smith
basso
i
tell
you
that
girl
would
follow
john
harkless
to
minnie
shook
her
head
mysteriously
and
bit
a
thread
with
a
vague
frown
well
why
not
asked
the
judge
crossly
why
would
she
have
him
then
well
who
knows
he
asked
her
yet
minnie
screamed
derisively
at
the
density
of
man
what
made
him
run
off
that
way
the
night
he
was
hurt
why
did
he
come
back
in
the
house
with
her
pshaw
do
you
suppose
a
woman
understands
meaning
that
you
know
more
about
it
than
i
do
i
presume
grunted
the
old
gentleman
yes
father
she
replied
smiling
benignantly
upon
him
did
she
tell
you
he
asked
abruptly
no
no
i
guess
the
truth
is
that
women
do
know
more
than
men
so
much
as
they
see
more
they
understand
more
without
having
to
read
about
that
the
way
of
it
is
it
he
laughed
well
it
do
make
any
difference
she
have
him
some
no
father
it
only
gratitude
the
judge
snorted
scornfully
girls
do
do
as
much
as
she
done
for
him
out
of
gratitude
what
she
doing
not
only
running
the
for
him
but
making
it
a
daily
and
a
good
daily
at
that
first
time
i
saw
her
i
knew
right
away
she
was
the
smartest
girl
i
ever
laid
eyes
on
i
expect
she
must
have
got
it
from
her
mother
gratitude
pooh
look
how
she
studied
his
interests
and
watched
like
a
cat
for
chances
for
him
in
everything
did
she
get
him
into
eph
watts
company
she
talked
to
watts
and
the
other
fellows
day
after
day
and
drove
around
their
leased
land
with
and
studied
it
up
and
got
on
the
inside
and
made
him
buy
now
if
they
strike
it
and
she
sure
they
will
and
sure
she
knows
when
to
have
faith
in
a
thing
why
they
sell
out
to
the
standard
and
they
can
all
quit
work
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
if
they
want
to
and
harkless
gets
as
much
as
any
without
lifting
a
finger
all
because
he
had
a
little
money
mighty
little
too
laid
up
in
bank
and
a
girl
that
saw
where
to
put
it
she
did
that
for
him
did
she
do
you
see
what
fun
it
been
for
her
returned
minnie
she
been
having
the
best
time
she
ever
had
i
never
knew
any
one
half
so
yes
she
went
up
and
saw
him
at
that
party
and
she
knows
he
still
thinking
about
her
i
should
be
surprised
if
he
asked
her
then
and
that
what
makes
her
so
well
she
could
have
said
because
he
went
back
to
his
bed
the
next
day
and
he
been
there
most
of
the
time
pshaw
he
was
over
his
injuries
and
he
was
weak
and
got
well
she
could
be
so
happy
while
he
sick
if
she
cared
very
much
about
he
not
very
sick
she
happy
because
she
working
for
him
and
she
knows
his
illness
is
serious
he
be
a
well
man
when
she
says
the
word
he
that
what
he
is
i
never
saw
a
man
so
taken
down
with
it
in
my
then
it
is
malaria
minnie
said
with
a
smile
of
some
superiority
you
just
like
your
poor
mother
the
old
gentleman
answered
growing
rather
red
she
never
could
learn
to
argue
what
i
say
is
that
helen
cares
about
him
whether
she
says
she
does
or
not
whether
she
acts
like
it
or
not
or
whether
she
thinks
she
does
or
not
he
added
irascibly
do
you
know
what
she
doing
for
him
not
well
when
they
were
talking
together
at
that
party
he
said
something
that
made
her
think
he
was
anxious
to
get
away
from
plattville
not
to
repeat
this
child
she
told
me
relying
on
my
well
do
you
know
why
she
got
these
men
to
come
here
to
meet
her
warren
smith
and
landis
and
homer
and
boswell
and
young
keating
of
amo
and
tom
martin
and
those
two
fellows
from
gaines
county
something
about
politics
is
it
about
politics
he
echoed
i
should
say
it
is
wait
till
it
done
and
this
evening
i
tell
you
if
you
can
keep
a
minnie
set
her
on
the
steps
oh
i
guess
i
can
keep
a
secret
she
said
but
it
wo
make
any
you
mean
you
said
it
and
you
stick
to
it
that
it
gratitude
till
their
wedding
she
knows
he
gave
her
father
something
to
do
and
helped
him
in
other
ways
when
no
one
else
i
know
all
about
that
she
reproaches
herself
for
having
neglected
fisbee
while
a
stranger
took
care
of
him
and
saved
him
from
starving
and
worse
she
unreasonable
about
it
she
did
know
he
was
in
want
till
long
after
that
just
like
fisbee
to
tell
her
afterwards
he
did
tell
her
how
low
he
got
but
he
hinted
at
it
to
her
and
i
guess
she
understood
i
gathered
that
much
from
him
of
course
she
grateful
but
gratefulness
do
account
for
yes
it
well
i
never
expected
to
have
the
last
word
with
a
well
you
need
said
minnie
i
do
i
never
do
he
retorted
she
did
not
answer
but
hummed
a
little
tune
and
looked
up
at
the
warren
smith
appeared
in
the
doorway
judge
he
said
will
you
step
inside
we
need
briscoe
nodded
and
rose
at
once
as
he
reached
the
door
minnie
said
in
a
piercing
whisper
it
hard
to
be
sure
about
her
but
i
right
it
there
he
replied
chuckling
i
thought
i
should
have
the
last
minnie
began
to
sing
and
the
judge
after
standing
in
the
doorway
till
he
was
again
summoned
from
within
slowly
retired
briscoe
had
persisted
in
his
own
explanation
of
helen
gaiety
nevertheless
he
did
not
question
his
daughter
assumption
that
the
young
lady
was
enjoying
her
career
in
carlow
she
was
free
as
a
bird
to
go
and
come
and
her
duties
and
pleasures
ran
together
in
a
happy
excitement
her
hands
were
full
of
work
but
she
sought
and
increased
new
tasks
and
performed
them
also
she
came
to
carlow
as
unused
to
the
soil
as
was
harkless
on
his
arrival
and
her
educational
equipment
for
the
work
was
far
less
than
his
her
experience
nothing
but
both
were
native
to
the
state
and
the
genius
of
the
american
is
adaptability
and
both
were
sprung
from
pioneers
whose
means
of
life
depended
on
that
quality
there
are
here
and
there
excrescent
individuals
who
through
stock
decadence
or
their
inability
to
comprehend
republican
conditions
are
not
assimilated
by
the
body
of
the
country
but
many
of
these
are
imports
while
some
are
exports
our
agitators
now
and
then
find
themselves
removed
by
the
police
to
institutions
of
routine
while
the
romantic
innocents
who
set
up
crests
in
the
face
of
an
unimpressionable
democracy
are
apt
to
be
lured
by
their
own
curious
ambitions
or
those
of
their
to
spend
a
great
part
of
their
time
in
or
about
the
villas
of
albion
thus
paid
for
its
perfidy
and
although
the
anarchists
and
the
make
a
noise
it
is
enormously
out
of
proportion
to
their
number
which
is
relatively
very
small
and
neither
the
imported
nor
the
exported
article
can
be
taken
as
characteristic
of
our
country
for
the
american
is
one
who
soon
fits
any
place
or
into
any
shaped
hole
in
america
where
you
can
set
him
down
it
may
be
that
without
going
so
far
as
to
suggest
the
halls
of
the
great
and
good
and
rich
one
might
mention
a
number
of
houses
of
entertainment
for
man
and
beast
in
this
country
in
which
martin
of
the
plattville
dry
goods
emporium
would
find
himself
little
at
ease
but
even
in
the
extreme
case
if
martin
were
given
his
choice
of
being
burned
to
death
or
drowned
or
of
spending
a
month
at
the
most
stupendously
embellished
tavern
located
in
our
possessions
and
supposing
him
to
have
chosen
the
third
alternate
it
is
probable
that
he
would
have
grown
almost
accustomed
to
his
surroundings
before
he
died
and
if
he
survived
the
month
we
may
even
fancy
him
really
enjoying
moments
of
conversation
with
the
as
parker
observed
miss
sherwood
did
not
do
the
grand
duchess
giving
the
carlow
tenants
a
treat
she
felt
no
duchess
symptoms
within
herself
and
though
of
course
she
had
various
manners
tucked
away
to
wear
as
one
suits
garments
to
occasions
and
it
was
a
rouen
wherewith
she
chose
to
abash
poor
john
harkless
at
their
meeting
here
in
carlow
she
was
a
woman
of
affairs
lively
shrewd
engaging
capable
she
was
herself
at
least
she
was
that
side
of
herself
and
it
should
be
explained
that
harkless
had
based
his
calumny
regarding
the
tariff
on
a
paragraph
or
two
that
crept
inadvertently
into
an
otherwise
statesmanlike
article
and
that
h
fisbee
understood
the
tariff
as
well
as
any
woman
who
ever
lived
but
the
tariff
inspired
no
more
articles
from
that
pen
rodney
mccune
had
lifted
his
head
and
those
who
had
followed
his
stricken
enemy
felt
that
the
cause
was
lost
without
the
leader
the
old
ring
that
the
herald
had
crushed
was
a
ring
once
more
and
the
heelers
had
rallied
the
boys
were
in
line
the
work
had
been
done
quietly
and
halloway
was
already
beaten
and
beaten
badly
john
harkless
lay
sick
and
rodney
mccune
would
sit
in
congress
for
the
nomination
meant
election
but
one
day
the
harkless
forces
demoralized
broken
almost
hopeless
woke
up
to
find
that
they
had
a
leader
many
of
them
were
content
with
the
belief
that
this
was
a
young
lawyer
named
keating
who
had
risen
up
in
amo
but
keating
himself
had
a
different
impression
helen
was
a
little
nervous
and
very
much
excited
over
the
political
conference
at
judge
briscoe
she
planned
it
with
careful
diplomacy
and
arranged
the
details
with
a
fine
sense
of
the
dramatic
there
was
a
suggestion
she
desired
to
have
made
in
this
meeting
which
she
wished
should
emanate
from
the
amo
and
gaines
county
people
instead
of
proceeding
from
carlow
for
she
thought
it
better
to
make
the
outsiders
believe
her
idea
an
inspiration
of
their
own
so
she
made
a
little
comedy
and
provided
for
briscoe
entrance
at
an
effective
moment
the
judge
was
a
substantial
influence
strong
in
the
councils
of
his
party
when
he
chose
to
be
and
though
of
late
years
he
had
contented
himself
with
voting
at
the
polls
every
one
knew
what
weight
he
carried
when
he
saw
fit
to
bestir
himself
when
he
entered
the
parlor
he
found
the
politicians
in
a
state
of
subdued
excitement
helen
sat
by
the
window
blushing
and
talking
eagerly
to
old
fisbee
one
of
the
gentlemen
from
gaines
county
was
walking
about
the
room
exclaiming
a
glorious
conception
a
glorious
conception
addressing
the
apparently
he
thought
the
conception
his
own
martin
was
tugging
at
his
beard
and
whispering
to
landis
and
homer
and
the
two
amo
men
were
consulting
in
a
corner
but
as
the
judge
came
in
one
of
them
turned
and
said
loudly
the
what
man
am
i
keating
asked
briscoe
cheerily
we
better
explain
i
guess
answered
the
other
and
turning
to
his
compatriot
you
tell
him
well
it
this
way
said
boswell
and
came
at
once
to
an
awkward
pause
turning
aside
sheepishly
and
unable
to
proceed
so
that
the
way
of
it
is
it
said
the
old
gentleman
helen
laughed
cheerfully
and
looked
about
her
with
a
courageous
and
encouraging
eye
it
is
embarrassing
she
said
judge
briscoe
we
are
contemplating
piece
of
the
blackest
treachery
and
chicanery
we
are
going
to
give
halloway
the
the
the
embarrassment
fell
away
and
everybody
began
to
talk
at
once
hold
on
a
minute
said
the
judge
let
get
at
it
straight
what
do
you
want
with
me
i
tell
you
volunteered
keating
you
see
the
boys
are
getting
in
line
again
for
this
convention
they
are
the
old
file
that
used
to
rule
the
roost
before
the
got
too
strong
for
them
and
they
rely
on
harkless
being
sick
to
beat
kedge
halloway
with
that
gaines
county
man
mccune
now
none
of
us
here
want
rod
mccune
i
guess
we
had
trouble
enough
once
with
him
and
his
heelers
and
now
that
harkless
is
down
they
taken
advantage
of
it
to
raise
a
revolution
rod
mccune
for
congress
he
a
swindler
i
hope
miss
sherwood
will
pardon
the
strong
expression
and
everybody
thought
the
had
driven
him
out
of
politics
though
it
never
told
how
it
did
it
but
he
up
on
top
again
now
the
question
is
to
beat
him
we
hold
the
committees
but
the
boys
have
been
fighting
the
committees
call
the
ring
and
never
understood
that
the
would
have
turned
us
down
in
a
second
if
it
thought
we
were
straight
well
we
saw
a
week
ago
that
kedge
halloway
was
going
to
lose
to
mccune
we
figured
it
out
pretty
exactly
and
there
ai
a
ray
of
hope
for
kedge
we
wrote
to
harkless
about
it
and
asked
him
to
come
down
if
been
on
the
ground
last
monday
and
had
begun
to
work
i
do
say
but
what
his
personal
influence
might
have
saved
halloway
but
a
friend
of
his
where
he
staying
answered
the
letter
said
harkless
was
down
with
a
relapse
and
was
very
fretful
and
he
taken
the
liberty
of
reading
the
letter
and
temporarily
suppressing
it
under
doctor
orders
they
were
afraid
he
come
sick
as
he
was
from
a
sense
of
duty
and
asked
us
to
withdraw
the
letter
and
referred
us
to
representative
on
the
so
we
applied
here
to
miss
sherwood
and
that
why
we
had
this
meeting
now
halloway
is
honest
everybody
knows
that
and
i
do
say
but
what
he
been
the
best
available
material
harkless
had
to
send
to
washington
but
he
ai
any
too
bright
martin
interrupted
the
speaker
i
reckon
maybe
you
never
heard
that
lecture
of
his
on
the
past
present
and
future
besides
that
keating
continued
halloway
has
had
it
long
enough
and
he
got
enough
glory
out
of
it
and
except
for
getting
beat
by
rod
mccune
i
believe
he
almost
as
soon
give
it
up
well
we
discussed
all
this
and
that
and
could
come
to
any
conclusion
we
did
want
to
keep
on
with
a
losing
fight
if
there
was
any
way
to
put
up
a
winner
though
of
course
we
all
recognized
that
harkless
would
want
us
to
support
kedge
to
the
death
and
that
what
he
do
if
he
was
on
the
ground
but
miss
sherwood
mentioned
that
she
had
one
note
since
his
last
illness
began
and
he
entrusted
her
and
her
associates
on
the
paper
with
the
entire
policy
and
she
would
take
the
responsibility
for
anything
we
determined
on
smith
said
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
give
up
halloway
and
get
a
man
that
could
beat
mccune
kedge
would
recognize
it
himself
that
that
was
the
only
thing
to
do
and
he
could
retire
gracefully
miss
sherwood
said
she
was
still
more
or
less
a
stranger
and
asked
what
man
we
could
find
who
was
strong
enough
to
do
it
by
popularity
alone
and
who
was
also
a
man
we
wanted
somebody
that
had
worked
a
good
deal
but
had
never
had
any
office
it
was
to
such
a
man
she
could
promise
the
support
as
for
a
time
the
paper
was
being
operated
almost
independently
it
might
be
said
of
harkless
well
i
expect
it
came
to
all
of
us
at
the
same
time
but
it
was
bence
here
that
said
it
bence
was
the
gentleman
who
had
walked
about
saying
a
glorious
conception
and
he
now
thrust
one
hand
into
his
breast
and
extended
the
other
in
a
wide
gesture
and
looked
as
impressive
as
a
very
young
man
with
white
eyebrows
can
look
the
name
of
harkless
he
said
abruptly
the
name
of
harkless
will
sweep
the
convention
like
the
fire
of
a
western
prairie
the
name
of
harkless
will
thunder
over
their
astonished
heads
and
strike
a
peal
of
joy
bells
in
every
home
in
the
district
it
will
in
the
corridors
of
posterity
and
teem
with
prosperity
like
a
mighty
river
the
name
of
harkless
will
reverberate
in
that
convention
hall
and
they
shall
sit
harkless
exclaimed
the
judge
why
did
some
one
think
of
that
long
ago
then
you
approve
asked
keating
yes
i
think
i
do
the
amo
man
shook
hands
with
him
we
swim
out
he
exclaimed
it
will
be
the
same
everywhere
a
lot
of
the
old
crowd
themselves
will
be
swept
along
with
us
when
we
make
our
nomination
people
feel
that
that
business
ought
never
to
have
been
allowed
to
happen
and
they
like
to
make
it
up
to
him
some
way
there
are
just
two
difficulties
halloway
and
harkless
himself
it
a
sure
thing
that
he
would
come
out
against
kedge
and
that
he
refuse
to
let
his
name
be
used
against
him
therefore
we
got
to
keep
it
quiet
from
him
the
whole
thing
has
to
be
worked
quietly
the
mccune
folks
were
quiet
until
they
thought
they
were
sure
we
got
to
be
quieter
still
well
made
out
a
and
a
plan
that
will
operate
added
bence
for
the
name
of
harkless
shall
keating
interrupted
him
energetically
we
explain
it
to
all
the
halloway
delegates
you
see
and
to
all
the
shaky
mccune
people
and
interview
all
the
undecided
ones
the
mccune
crowd
may
see
them
afterwards
but
they
ca
fix
men
in
this
district
against
john
harkless
all
we
got
to
do
is
to
pass
the
word
it
all
kept
quiet
you
understand
we
go
into
the
convention
and
the
names
of
halloway
and
mccune
are
placed
before
it
then
will
come
a
speech
naming
harkless
and
you
want
to
stuff
your
ears
with
cotton
on
the
first
ballot
harkless
gets
the
scattering
vote
that
was
going
to
nominate
mccune
if
we
let
things
run
and
halloway
is
given
every
vote
have
got
if
he
run
against
mccune
alone
it
as
a
compliment
it
will
help
him
see
how
things
were
afterwards
and
on
the
second
ballot
his
vote
goes
to
harkless
there
wo
be
any
hitch
if
we
get
down
to
work
right
off
it
a
mighty
short
campaign
but
we
got
big
chances
of
course
it
ca
be
helped
that
halloway
has
to
be
kept
in
the
dark
he
wo
spend
any
money
it
looks
a
little
underhanded
at
first
glance
said
warren
smith
but
as
miss
sherwood
said
you
got
to
be
a
little
underhanded
sometimes
especially
when
you
dealing
with
as
scrupulous
a
man
as
john
harkless
but
it
a
perfectly
honest
deal
and
it
will
be
all
right
with
him
when
he
finds
it
all
over
and
he
it
a
plain
case
added
boswell
we
want
him
and
we
got
to
have
there
one
danger
keating
continued
kedge
halloway
is
honest
but
i
believe
he
selfish
enough
to
disturb
his
best
friend
deathbed
for
his
own
ends
and
it
not
unlikely
that
he
will
get
nervous
towards
the
last
and
be
telegraphing
harkless
to
have
himself
carried
on
a
cot
to
the
convention
to
save
him
that
would
do
at
all
of
course
and
miss
sherwood
thinks
maybe
there
be
less
danger
if
we
set
the
convention
a
little
ahead
of
the
day
appointed
it
dangerous
because
it
shortens
our
time
but
we
can
fix
it
for
three
days
before
the
day
we
settled
on
and
that
will
bring
it
to
september
what
we
want
of
you
judge
is
to
go
to
the
convention
as
a
delegate
and
make
the
nominating
speech
for
harkless
will
you
do
it
do
it
cried
the
old
man
and
he
struck
the
table
a
resounding
blow
with
his
big
fist
do
it
i
walk
from
here
to
rouen
and
back
again
to
do
it
they
were
all
on
their
feet
at
this
and
they
pressed
forward
to
shake
briscoe
hand
congratulating
him
and
each
other
as
though
they
were
already
victorious
martin
bent
over
helen
and
asked
her
if
she
minded
shaking
hands
with
a
man
who
had
voted
for
shem
at
the
first
election
in
the
ark
i
thought
i
rightly
ort
to
thank
you
for
finishin
off
kedge
halloway
he
added
i
made
up
my
mind
i
never
vote
for
him
again
the
night
he
killed
that
intellectual
insect
of
intellectual
insect
martin
she
asked
puzzled
he
sighed
the
recollection
never
quits
me
i
reckon
i
had
a
restful
night
since
june
maybe
you
do
remember
his
oh
but
i
do
she
laughed
and
i
remember
the
story
of
the
fly
i
never
was
jest
what
you
might
exactly
call
gushin
over
kedge
martin
drawled
he
does
strike
me
as
havin
many
ideas
precisely
he
had
kind
of
a
symptom
of
one
once
that
he
caught
from
harkless
but
it
did
take
it
sloshed
around
in
his
mind
and
never
really
come
out
on
him
i
always
thought
his
brain
was
sort
of
syrupy
harkless
thought
there
was
fruit
in
it
and
i
reckon
there
is
but
some
way
it
never
seems
to
go
on
said
helen
gayly
i
want
to
hear
him
abused
it
helps
me
to
feel
less
mean
about
the
way
we
are
treating
yes
i
slickin
over
my
conscience
too
i
feel
awnrier
about
it
because
he
done
me
a
good
turn
once
in
the
hayes
and
wheeler
campaign
i
went
to
a
meetin
to
hear
him
speak
and
he
got
sick
and
warren
smith
addressed
the
company
well
is
this
all
for
the
present
he
asked
is
everything
settled
wait
a
minute
said
keating
i
like
to
hear
from
the
about
its
policy
if
miss
sherwood
will
tell
yes
indeed
she
answered
it
will
be
very
simple
do
you
think
there
is
only
one
course
to
pursue
we
will
advocate
no
one
very
energetically
but
we
will
print
as
much
of
the
truth
about
mccune
as
we
can
with
delicacy
and
honor
in
this
case
but
as
i
understand
it
the
work
is
almost
all
to
be
done
amongst
the
delegates
we
shall
not
mention
our
plan
at
all
but
but
when
the
convention
is
over
and
he
is
nominated
we
will
get
out
an
extra
and
i
am
so
confident
of
your
success
that
i
tell
you
now
that
the
extra
will
be
ready
the
night
before
the
convention
we
will
contrive
that
harkless
shall
not
receive
his
copy
of
the
paper
containing
the
notice
of
the
change
of
date
and
i
think
the
chance
of
his
seeing
it
in
any
rouen
paper
may
be
avoided
that
is
all
i
thank
you
said
keating
that
is
certainly
the
course
to
every
one
nodded
or
acquiesced
in
words
and
keating
and
bence
came
over
to
helen
and
engaged
her
in
conversation
the
others
began
to
look
about
for
their
hats
vaguely
preparing
to
leave
wait
a
minute
said
the
judge
there
no
train
due
just
and
minnie
appeared
in
the
doorway
with
a
big
pitcher
of
cider
rich
and
sparkling
cold
and
redolent
of
the
orchard
where
it
was
born
behind
miss
briscoe
came
mildy
upton
with
glasses
and
a
fat
shaking
on
a
second
tray
the
judge
passed
his
cigars
around
and
the
gentlemen
took
them
blithely
then
hesitatingly
held
them
in
their
fingers
and
glanced
at
the
ladies
uncertain
of
permission
let
me
get
you
some
matches
helen
said
quickly
and
found
a
box
on
the
table
and
handed
it
to
keating
every
one
sat
beaming
and
fragrant
veils
of
smoke
soon
draped
the
room
why
do
you
call
her
sherwood
boswell
whispered
in
ear
that
her
ai
she
the
daughter
of
that
old
fellow
over
there
by
the
window
ai
her
name
fisbee
no
she
his
daughter
but
her
legal
name
sherwood
she
an
adop
great
scott
i
know
all
about
that
i
like
to
know
if
there
a
man
woman
or
child
in
this
part
of
the
country
that
does
i
guess
it
wo
be
fisbee
or
sherwood
either
very
long
she
can
easy
get
a
new
name
lady
and
if
she
took
a
fancy
to
boswell
why
i
a
bach
i
expect
she
wo
take
a
fancy
to
boswell
very
early
said
keating
they
say
it
will
be
go
returned
boswell
what
do
you
want
to
say
that
for
ca
you
bear
for
anybody
to
be
happy
a
minute
or
two
now
and
then
warren
smith
approached
helen
and
inquired
if
it
would
be
asking
too
much
if
they
petitioned
her
for
some
music
so
she
went
to
the
piano
and
sang
some
darky
songs
for
them
with
a
quaint
suggestion
of
the
dialect
two
or
three
negro
melodies
of
foster
followed
by
some
rollicking
modern
imitations
with
the
movement
and
spirit
of
a
tinshop
falling
down
a
flight
of
stairs
her
audience
listened
in
delight
from
the
first
but
the
latter
songs
quite
overcame
them
with
pleasure
and
admiration
and
before
she
finished
every
head
in
the
room
was
jogging
from
side
to
side
and
forward
and
back
in
time
to
the
music
while
every
foot
shuffled
the
measures
on
the
carpet
when
the
gentlemen
from
out
of
town
discovered
that
it
was
time
to
leave
if
they
meant
to
catch
their
train
helen
called
to
them
to
wait
and
they
gathered
about
her
just
one
second
she
said
and
she
poured
all
the
glasses
full
to
the
brim
then
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
they
made
around
her
she
said
before
you
go
sha
we
pledge
each
other
to
our
success
in
this
good
indiana
cider
that
leaves
our
heads
clear
and
our
arms
strong
if
you
will
then
she
began
to
blush
furiously
and
her
voice
trembled
but
she
lifted
the
glass
high
over
her
head
and
cried
bravely
here
to
candidate
the
big
men
towering
over
her
threw
back
their
heads
and
quaffed
the
gentle
liquor
to
the
last
drop
then
they
sent
up
the
first
shout
of
the
campaign
and
cheered
john
harkless
till
the
rafters
rang
my
friends
said
keating
as
he
and
boswell
and
the
men
from
gaines
drove
away
in
judd
bennett
omnibus
my
friends
here
is
where
i
begin
the
warmest
hustling
i
ever
did
i
want
harkless
everybody
wants
him
it
is
a
glorious
idea
said
bence
the
name
of
harkless
keating
drowned
the
oratory
but
that
is
all
that
little
girl
wants
him
to
go
to
congress
and
that
settles
it
he
that
evening
minnie
and
her
father
were
strolling
up
and
down
the
front
walk
together
between
the
flowered
borders
do
you
give
up
asked
the
judge
give
up
what
no
returned
his
daughter
she
has
told
you
not
yet
she
and
fisbee
left
for
the
office
right
after
those
men
have
you
discovered
what
the
about
politics
she
doing
for
him
is
did
you
understand
what
she
meant
by
candidate
not
did
you
see
her
blush
when
she
proposed
that
toast
yes
so
would
anybody
with
all
those
men
and
their
eyes
hanging
out
on
their
cheeks
pooh
she
got
up
the
whole
show
do
you
know
why
i
only
know
it
politics
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
and
then
leaning
toward
her
he
said
in
a
low
tone
i
tell
you
in
confidence
minnie
sending
him
to
congress
ah
she
cried
triumphantly
if
she
loved
him
she
would
do
would
she
minnie
briscoe
turned
upon
her
sternly
i
do
want
to
hear
any
more
talk
like
that
it
the
way
with
some
papers
to
jibe
at
our
great
institutions
and
you
been
reading
them
that
the
trouble
with
you
the
only
criticism
any
one
has
any
business
making
against
congress
is
that
it
too
good
for
some
of
the
men
we
send
there
congress
is
our
great
virtue
understand
the
congressmen
are
our
i
did
mean
anything
like
that
protested
the
girl
i
have
been
reading
any
papers
except
the
i
meant
why
should
she
send
him
away
if
she
cared
about
him
she
go
with
they
could
both
go
what
would
become
of
the
they
fix
that
easy
enough
there
are
plenty
of
smart
young
fellows
in
rouen
they
could
get
to
run
it
while
they
are
in
mr
harkless
is
sure
to
be
elected
is
he
he
is
if
he
ca
he
get
the
nomination
get
it
nobody
ever
happened
to
think
of
him
for
it
till
it
came
into
head
and
the
only
thing
i
look
to
see
standing
in
the
way
of
it
is
harkless
himself
but
i
expect
we
can
leave
it
to
her
to
manage
and
i
guess
she
will
she
got
more
diplomacy
than
blaine
kedge
halloway
is
up
the
spout
all
right
but
they
want
to
keep
it
quiet
that
why
she
had
them
come
here
instead
of
the
she
would
marry
him
a
minute
sooner
because
he
went
to
congress
said
minnie
thoughtfully
you
giving
up
he
exclaimed
you
know
i
wait
and
see
it
might
no
you
wrong
as
wrong
can
be
i
wish
you
were
do
you
see
you
blind
she
do
all
these
things
for
him
if
she
loved
him
that
the
very
proof
itself
i
suppose
you
well
you
ca
i
tell
you
one
thing
he
returned
if
she
does
the
rest
of
it
wo
amount
to
a
rip
with
john
yes
it
will
nobody
could
help
liking
to
find
himself
as
big
a
man
as
he
be
when
he
comes
back
here
besides
do
you
see
it
her
way
of
making
it
up
to
him
for
not
liking
him
as
much
as
he
wants
give
up
do
you
no
he
cried
with
feeble
violence
i
do
she
find
out
some
things
about
herself
when
she
sees
him
minnie
shook
her
head
there
was
a
sound
of
wheels
the
buckboard
drew
up
at
the
gate
and
helen
returning
from
her
evening
labor
jumped
out
lightly
and
ran
around
to
pat
the
horses
heads
thank
you
so
much
willetts
she
said
to
the
driver
i
know
you
will
handle
the
two
delegates
you
are
to
look
after
as
well
as
you
do
the
judge
team
and
you
ought
to
you
know
because
the
delegates
are
men
you
dears
she
stroked
the
sleek
necks
of
the
colts
and
handed
them
bunches
of
grass
briscoe
came
out
and
let
the
friendly
animals
nose
his
shoulder
as
he
looked
gravely
down
on
the
piquant
face
beside
him
in
the
dusk
young
lady
he
said
go
east
wait
till
we
get
on
to
washington
and
sit
in
the
gallery
and
see
john
harkless
rise
up
in
his
place
and
hear
the
speaker
say
gentleman
from
indiana
i
know
the
chills
would
go
up
and
down
my
spine
and
i
guess
you
feel
pretty
well
paid
for
your
day
work
i
guess
we
all
are
you
tired
helen
asked
minnie
coming
to
her
in
the
darkness
and
clasping
her
waist
tired
no
i
happy
did
you
ever
see
the
stars
so
bright
chapter
xviii
the
treachery
of
fisbee
an
indiana
town
may
lie
asleep
a
long
time
but
there
always
comes
a
day
when
it
wakes
up
and
plattville
had
wakened
in
august
when
the
herald
became
a
daily
and
eph
watts
struck
oil
it
was
then
that
history
began
to
be
made
the
herald
printed
news
and
the
paper
was
sold
every
morning
at
stands
in
all
the
towns
in
that
section
of
the
state
its
circulation
tripled
parker
talked
of
new
presses
two
men
were
added
to
his
staff
and
a
reporter
was
brought
from
rouen
to
join
fisbee
the
herald
boomed
the
people
swarmed
into
town
the
hotel
was
crowded
strangers
became
no
sensation
whatever
a
capitalist
bought
the
whole
north
side
of
the
square
to
erect
new
stores
and
the
carlow
bank
began
the
construction
of
a
new
bank
building
of
bedford
stone
on
main
street
then
it
was
whispered
next
affirmed
that
the
herald
had
succeeded
in
another
of
its
enterprises
and
main
street
was
to
be
asphalted
that
was
the
end
of
the
old
days
of
plattville
there
was
a
man
who
had
laid
the
foundation
upon
which
the
new
plattville
was
to
be
built
he
who
through
the
quiet
labor
of
years
had
stamped
his
spirit
upon
the
people
as
their
own
was
stamped
upon
him
but
he
lay
sick
in
his
friend
house
and
did
not
care
one
day
meredith
found
him
propped
up
in
bed
reading
a
letter
reading
it
listlessly
and
with
a
dull
eye
plattville
yours
of
the
received
every
one
here
is
very
glad
to
know
that
your
health
is
so
far
improved
as
to
admit
of
your
writing
and
it
is
our
strongest
hope
that
you
will
soon
be
completely
recovered
new
subscriptions
are
coming
in
at
a
slightly
advanced
rate
since
my
last
letter
you
will
see
they
are
distributed
over
several
counties
when
you
examine
the
books
on
your
return
and
i
am
glad
to
state
that
with
our
arrangement
for
gainesville
the
is
now
selling
every
morning
at
a
prominent
store
in
all
the
towns
within
the
radius
we
determined
on
our
plan
of
offering
the
daily
with
no
advance
on
the
price
of
the
former
issue
proves
a
success
i
now
propose
making
the
issue
a
quarto
every
day
at
the
same
price
instead
of
once
a
week
i
think
our
experience
warrants
the
experiment
it
is
my
belief
that
our
present
circulation
will
be
increased
forty
per
cent
please
advise
me
if
you
approve
of
course
this
would
mean
a
further
increase
of
our
working
force
and
we
should
have
to
bring
another
man
from
rouen
possibly
two
more
but
i
think
we
need
not
fear
such
enlargements
i
should
tell
you
that
i
have
taken
you
at
your
word
entrusting
me
with
the
entire
charge
of
your
interests
here
and
i
had
the
adjoining
the
office
put
in
shape
and
offered
it
to
the
telegraph
company
for
half
the
rent
they
were
paying
in
their
former
quarters
over
the
they
have
moved
in
and
this
in
addition
to
giving
us
our
despatches
direct
is
a
reduction
of
expense
mr
watts
informs
me
that
the
standard
offer
is
liberal
and
the
terms
are
settled
the
boom
is
not
hollow
it
is
simply
an
awakening
and
the
town
so
long
a
dependent
upon
the
impetus
of
agriculture
or
its
trade
is
developing
a
prosperity
of
its
own
on
other
lines
as
well
strangers
come
every
day
oil
has
lubricated
every
commercial
joint
contracts
have
been
let
for
three
new
brick
business
buildings
to
be
erected
on
the
east
side
of
the
square
the
value
of
your
main
street
frontage
will
have
doubled
by
december
and
possibly
you
may
see
fit
to
tear
away
the
present
building
and
put
up
another
instead
the
investment
might
be
profitable
the
could
find
room
on
the
second
and
third
floors
and
the
first
could
be
let
to
stores
i
regret
that
you
find
your
copy
of
the
paper
for
the
overlooked
in
the
mail
and
that
your
messenger
could
find
none
for
you
at
the
newspaper
offices
in
rouen
schofield
was
given
directions
in
regard
to
supplying
you
with
the
missing
issue
at
once
i
fear
that
you
may
have
had
difficulty
in
deciphering
some
of
my
former
missives
as
i
was
unfamiliar
with
the
typewriter
when
i
took
charge
of
the
however
i
trust
that
you
find
my
later
letters
more
legible
the
mccune
people
are
not
worrying
us
we
are
sure
to
defeat
them
the
papers
you
speak
of
were
found
by
parker
in
your
trunk
and
are
now
in
my
hands
i
send
with
this
a
packet
of
communications
and
press
clippings
indicative
of
the
success
of
the
daily
and
in
regard
to
other
innovations
the
letters
from
women
commendatory
of
our
page
thanking
us
for
various
receipts
strike
me
as
peculiarly
interesting
as
i
admit
that
a
page
is
always
a
difficult
matter
for
a
man
to
handle
without
absurdity
please
do
not
think
i
mean
to
plume
myself
upon
our
various
successes
we
attempted
our
innovations
and
enlargements
at
just
the
right
time
a
time
which
you
had
ripened
by
years
of
work
and
waiting
and
at
the
moment
when
you
had
built
up
the
reputation
of
the
to
its
highest
point
everything
that
has
been
done
is
successful
only
because
you
paved
the
way
and
because
every
one
knows
it
is
your
paper
and
the
people
believe
that
whatever
your
paper
does
is
interesting
and
right
trusting
that
your
recovery
will
be
rapid
i
am
yours
truly
h
harkless
dropped
the
typewritten
sheets
with
a
sigh
i
suppose
i
ought
to
get
well
he
said
wearily
yes
said
meredith
i
think
you
ought
but
you
chock
full
of
malaria
and
fever
and
all
kinds
of
meanness
and
you
to
your
own
troubles
returned
the
other
with
an
imitation
of
liveliness
i
i
do
think
it
interests
me
much
he
said
querulously
he
was
often
querulous
of
late
and
it
frightened
tom
just
tired
i
am
strong
enough
that
is
i
think
i
am
till
i
try
to
move
around
and
then
i
like
a
log
and
a
lethargy
gets
me
that
it
i
do
think
it
malaria
it
lethargy
comes
from
it
the
other
way
with
me
i
be
all
right
if
i
only
could
get
over
this
this
tiredness
let
me
have
that
pencil
and
pad
will
you
please
tom
he
set
the
pad
on
his
knee
and
began
to
write
languidly
rouen
yours
of
the
to
hand
i
entirely
approve
all
arrangements
you
have
made
i
think
you
understand
that
i
wish
you
to
regard
as
in
your
own
hands
you
are
the
editor
of
the
and
have
the
sole
responsibility
for
everything
including
policy
until
after
proper
warning
i
relieve
you
in
person
but
until
that
time
comes
you
must
look
upon
me
as
a
mere
spectator
i
do
not
fear
that
you
will
make
any
mistakes
you
have
done
very
much
better
in
all
matters
than
i
could
have
done
myself
at
present
i
have
only
one
suggestion
i
observe
that
your
editorials
concerning
renomination
are
something
lukewarm
it
is
very
important
that
he
be
renominated
not
altogether
on
account
of
assuring
his
return
to
washington
for
he
is
no
madison
i
fear
but
the
fellow
mccune
must
be
so
beaten
that
his
defeat
will
be
remembered
for
twenty
years
halloway
is
honest
and
clean
at
least
while
mccune
is
corrupt
to
the
bone
he
has
been
bought
and
sold
and
i
am
glad
the
proofs
of
it
are
in
your
hands
as
you
tell
me
parker
found
them
as
directed
in
my
trunk
and
gave
them
to
you
the
papers
you
hold
drove
him
out
of
politics
once
by
the
mere
threat
of
publication
you
should
have
printed
them
last
week
as
i
suggested
do
so
at
once
the
time
is
short
you
have
been
too
gentle
it
has
the
air
of
fearing
to
offend
and
of
catering
as
if
we
were
afraid
of
antagonizing
people
against
us
as
though
we
had
a
personal
stake
in
the
convention
possibly
you
consider
our
subscription
books
as
such
i
do
not
but
if
they
are
go
ahead
twice
as
hard
what
if
it
does
give
the
enemy
a
weapon
in
case
mccune
is
nominated
if
he
is
and
i
begin
to
see
a
danger
of
it
we
will
be
with
the
enemy
i
do
not
carry
my
partisanship
so
far
as
to
help
elect
mccune
to
congress
you
have
been
as
in
your
editorials
as
if
this
were
a
fit
time
for
delicacy
and
the
cheaper
conception
of
party
policy
my
notion
of
party
policy
no
new
one
is
that
the
party
which
considers
the
public
service
before
it
considers
itself
will
thrive
best
in
the
long
run
the
is
a
little
paper
not
so
little
nowadays
after
all
thanks
to
you
but
it
is
an
honest
one
and
it
is
afraid
of
rod
mccune
and
his
friends
he
is
to
be
beaten
understand
if
we
have
to
send
him
to
the
penitentiary
on
an
old
issue
to
do
it
and
if
the
people
wish
to
believe
us
cruel
or
vengeful
let
them
please
let
me
see
as
hearty
a
word
as
you
can
say
for
halloway
also
you
can
write
with
ginger
please
show
some
in
this
matter
my
condition
is
improved
i
am
very
truly
yours
john
when
the
letter
was
concluded
he
handed
it
to
meredith
please
address
that
put
a
on
it
and
send
it
tom
it
should
go
at
once
so
as
to
reach
him
by
h
fisbee
yes
i
believe
it
does
you
good
to
write
boy
said
the
other
as
he
bent
over
him
you
look
more
chirrupy
than
you
have
for
several
it
that
beast
mccune
young
fisbee
is
rather
queer
about
it
and
i
felt
stirred
up
as
i
went
but
even
before
the
sentence
was
finished
the
favor
of
age
and
utter
weariness
returned
and
the
dark
lids
closed
over
his
eyes
they
opened
again
slowly
and
he
took
the
others
hand
and
looked
up
at
him
mournfully
but
as
it
were
his
soul
shone
forth
in
dumb
and
eloquent
thanks
i
i
giving
you
a
jolly
summer
tom
he
said
with
a
quivering
effort
to
smile
do
you
think
i
am
i
do
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
you
old
indian
said
meredith
tenderly
three
days
later
tom
was
rejoiced
by
symptoms
of
invigoration
in
his
patient
a
telegram
came
for
harkless
and
meredith
bringing
it
into
the
sick
room
was
surprised
to
find
the
occupant
sitting
straight
up
on
his
couch
without
the
prop
of
pillows
he
was
reading
the
day
copy
of
the
herald
and
his
face
was
flushed
and
his
brow
stern
what
the
matter
boy
mismanagement
i
hope
said
the
other
in
a
strong
voice
worse
perhaps
it
this
young
fisbee
i
ca
think
what
come
over
the
fellow
i
thought
he
was
a
rescuing
angel
and
he
turning
out
bad
i
swear
it
looks
like
they
been
well
i
wo
say
that
yet
but
he
has
printed
that
mccune
business
i
told
you
of
and
he
had
two
days
there
is
less
than
a
week
before
the
convention
and
he
broke
off
seeing
the
yellow
envelope
in
meredith
hand
is
that
a
telegram
for
me
his
companion
gave
it
to
him
he
tore
it
open
and
read
the
contents
they
were
brief
and
unhappy
ca
you
do
something
ca
you
come
down
it
begins
to
look
the
other
way
k
it
from
halloway
said
john
i
have
got
to
go
what
did
that
doctor
say
he
said
two
weeks
at
the
earliest
or
you
run
into
typhoid
and
complications
from
your
hurts
and
even
pleasanter
things
than
that
i
got
you
here
and
here
you
stay
so
lie
back
and
get
easy
then
give
me
that
pad
and
he
rapidly
dashed
off
a
note
to
fisbee
h
fisbee
editor
herald
you
have
not
acknowledged
my
letter
of
the
september
by
a
note
which
should
have
reached
me
the
following
morning
or
by
the
alteration
in
the
tenor
of
my
columns
which
i
requested
or
by
the
publication
of
the
mccune
papers
which
i
directed
in
this
i
hold
you
grossly
at
fault
if
you
have
a
conscientious
reason
for
refusing
to
carry
out
my
request
it
should
have
been
communicated
to
me
at
once
as
should
the
fact
if
such
be
the
case
that
you
are
a
personal
or
impersonal
if
you
like
friend
of
rodney
mccune
whatever
the
motive
ulterior
or
otherwise
which
prevents
you
from
operating
my
paper
as
i
direct
i
should
have
been
informed
of
it
this
is
a
matter
vital
to
the
interests
of
our
community
and
you
have
hitherto
shown
yourself
too
alert
in
accepting
my
slightest
suggestion
for
me
to
construe
this
failure
as
negligence
negligence
i
might
esteem
as
at
least
honest
and
frank
your
course
has
been
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
you
will
receive
this
letter
by
seven
this
evening
by
special
delivery
you
will
print
the
facts
concerning
mccune
in
morning
paper
i
am
well
aware
of
the
obligations
under
which
your
extreme
efficiency
and
your
thoughtfulness
in
many
matters
have
placed
me
it
is
to
you
i
owe
my
unearned
profits
from
the
transaction
in
oil
and
it
is
to
you
i
owe
the
extraordinary
present
circulation
growth
of
power
and
influence
that
power
is
still
under
my
direction
and
is
an
added
responsibility
which
shall
not
be
misapplied
you
must
forgive
me
if
i
write
too
sharply
you
see
i
have
failed
to
understand
your
silence
and
if
i
wrong
you
i
heartily
ask
your
pardon
in
advance
of
your
explanation
is
it
that
you
are
sorry
for
mccune
it
would
be
a
weak
pity
that
could
keep
you
to
silence
i
warned
him
long
ago
that
the
papers
you
hold
would
be
published
if
he
ever
tried
to
return
to
political
life
and
he
is
deliberately
counting
on
my
physical
weakness
and
absence
let
him
rely
upon
it
i
am
not
so
weak
as
he
thinks
personally
i
can
not
say
that
i
dislike
mccune
i
have
found
him
a
very
entertaining
fellow
it
is
said
he
is
the
best
of
husbands
and
a
friend
to
some
of
his
friends
and
believe
me
i
am
sorry
for
him
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
but
the
is
not
you
need
not
reply
by
letter
issue
answers
for
you
until
i
have
received
a
copy
i
withhold
my
judgment
john
the
morrow
issue
that
fateful
print
on
which
depended
john
opinion
of
fisbee
integrity
contained
an
editorial
addressed
to
the
delegates
of
the
convention
warning
them
to
act
for
the
vital
interest
of
the
community
and
declaring
that
the
opportunity
to
be
given
them
in
the
present
convention
was
a
rare
one
a
singular
piece
of
good
fortune
indeed
they
were
to
have
the
chance
to
vote
for
a
man
who
had
won
the
love
and
respect
of
every
person
in
the
district
one
who
had
suffered
for
his
championship
of
righteousness
one
whom
even
his
few
political
enemies
confessed
they
held
in
personal
affection
and
esteem
one
who
had
been
the
inspiration
of
a
new
era
one
whose
life
had
been
helpfulness
whose
hand
had
reached
out
to
every
struggler
and
unfortunate
a
man
who
had
met
and
faced
danger
for
the
sake
of
others
one
who
lived
under
a
threat
for
years
and
who
had
been
almost
overborne
in
the
fulfilment
of
that
threat
but
who
would
live
to
see
the
sun
shine
on
his
triumph
the
tribute
the
convention
would
bring
him
as
a
gift
from
a
community
that
loved
him
his
name
needed
not
to
be
told
it
was
on
every
lip
that
morning
and
in
every
heart
tom
was
eagerly
watching
his
companion
as
he
read
harkless
fell
back
on
the
pillows
with
a
drawn
face
and
for
a
moment
he
laid
his
thin
hand
over
his
eyes
in
a
gesture
of
intense
pain
what
is
it
meredith
said
quickly
give
me
the
pad
what
is
it
boy
the
other
teeth
snapped
together
what
is
it
he
cried
what
is
it
it
treachery
and
the
worst
i
ever
knew
not
a
word
of
the
accusation
i
demanded
lying
instead
read
that
editorial
there
he
struck
the
page
with
the
back
of
his
hand
and
threw
the
paper
to
meredith
read
that
miserable
lie
who
has
won
the
love
and
respect
of
every
person
in
the
district
who
has
suffered
for
his
championship
of
righteousness
save
the
mark
what
does
it
mean
mean
it
means
mccune
rod
mccune
has
lived
under
a
threat
for
years
threat
i
swore
i
would
print
him
out
of
indiana
if
he
ever
raised
his
head
again
and
he
knew
i
could
overborne
in
the
fulfilment
of
that
threat
it
a
black
scheme
and
i
see
it
now
this
man
came
to
plattville
and
went
on
the
for
nothing
in
the
world
but
this
it
mccune
hand
all
along
he
dare
name
him
even
now
the
coward
the
trick
lies
between
mccune
and
young
fisbee
the
old
man
is
innocent
give
me
the
pad
not
overborne
there
are
three
good
days
to
work
in
and
by
the
gods
of
perdition
if
rod
mccune
sees
congress
it
will
be
in
his
next
incarnation
he
rapidly
scribbled
a
few
lines
on
the
pad
and
threw
the
sheets
to
meredith
get
those
telegrams
to
the
western
union
office
in
a
rush
please

them

a
very
red
face

beat
mccune
john
the
author
of
the
curt
epistles
tossed
restlessly
on
his
couch
but
the
reader
of
them
stared
incredulous
and
dumfounded
uncertain
of
his
command
of
gravity
his
jaw
fell
and
his
open
mouth
might
have
betokened
a
being
smit
to
imbecility
and
haply
he
might
be
for
helen
had
written
him
from
plattville
pledging
his
honor
to
secrecy
with
the
first
words
and
it
was
by
her
command
that
he
had
found
excuses
for
not
supplying
his
patient
with
all
the
papers
which
happened
to
contain
references
to
the
change
of
date
for
the
plattville
convention
and
meredith
had
known
for
some
time
where
james
fisbee
had
found
a
young
relative
to
be
the
savior
of
the
herald
for
his
benefactor
sake
you
mean
you
intend
to
you
discharge
young
fisbee
he
stammered
at
last
yes
let
me
have
the
answers
the
instant
they
come
will
you
tom
then
harkless
turned
his
face
from
the
wall
and
spoke
through
his
teeth
i
mean
to
see
fisbee
before
many
days
i
want
to
talk
to
him
but
though
he
tossed
and
fretted
himself
into
what
the
doctor
pronounced
a
decidedly
improved
state
no
answer
came
to
either
telegram
that
day
or
night
the
next
morning
a
messenger
boy
stumbled
up
the
front
steps
and
handed
the
colored
man
jim
four
yellow
envelopes
night
messages
three
of
them
were
for
harkless
one
was
for
meredith
jim
carried
them
upstairs
left
the
three
with
his
master
guest
then
knocked
on
his
master
door
what
is
it
answered
a
thick
voice
meredith
had
not
yet
risen
a
telegraph
mist
there
was
a
terrific
yawn
slide
it
oh
under
the
meredith
lay
quite
without
motion
for
several
minutes
sleepily
watching
the
yellow
rhomboid
in
the
crevice
it
was
a
hateful
looking
thing
to
come
mixing
in
with
pleasant
dreams
and
insist
upon
being
read
after
a
while
he
climbed
groaningly
out
of
bed
and
read
the
message
with
heavy
eyes
still
half
asleep
he
read
it
twice
before
it
penetrated
suppress
all
newspapers
convention
meets
at
eleven
if
we
succeed
a
delegation
will
come
to
rouen
this
afternoon
they
will
come
tom
rubbed
his
sticky
eyelids
and
shook
his
head
violently
in
a
spartan
effort
to
rouse
himself
but
what
more
effectively
performed
the
task
for
him
were
certain
sounds
issuing
from
harkless
room
across
the
hall
for
some
minutes
meredith
had
been
dully
conscious
of
a
rustle
and
stir
in
the
invalid
chamber
and
he
began
to
realize
that
no
mere
tossing
about
a
bed
would
account
for
a
noise
that
reached
him
across
a
wide
hall
and
through
two
closed
doors
of
thick
walnut
suddenly
he
heard
a
quick
heavy
tread
shod
in
harkless
room
and
a
resounding
bang
as
some
heavy
object
struck
the
floor
the
doctor
was
not
to
come
till
evening
jim
had
gone
who
wore
shoes
in
the
sick
man
room
he
rushed
across
the
hall
in
his
pyjamas
and
threw
open
the
unlocked
door
the
bed
was
disarranged
and
vacant
harkless
fully
dressed
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
hurling
garments
at
a
big
travelling
bag
the
horrified
meredith
stood
for
a
second
bleached
and
speechless
then
he
rushed
upon
his
friend
and
seized
him
with
both
hands
mad
by
heaven

his
companion
slung
a
light
overcoat
unfolded
on
the
overflowing
misshapen
bundle
of
clothes
that
lay
in
the
bag
then
he
jumped
on
the
lid
with
both
feet
and
kicked
the
hasp
into
the
lock
a
very
elegantly
laundered
cuff
and
white
sleeve
dangling
out
from
between
the
fastened
lids

meredith
looked
him
in
the
eyes
in
the
pupils
of
harkless
flared
a
fierce
light
his
cheeks
were
reddened
with
an
angry
healthy
glow
and
his
teeth
were
clenched
till
the
line
of
his
jaw
stood
out
like
that
of
an
embattled
athlete
in
sculpture
his
brow
was
dark
his
chest
was
thrown
out
and
he
took
deep
quick
breaths
his
shoulders
were
squared
and
in
spite
of
his
thinness
they
looked
massy
lethargy
or
malaria
or
both
whatever
were
his
ailments
they
were
gone
he
was
six
feet
of
hot
wrath
and
cold
resolution
tom
said
you
are
going
yes
he
answered
i
am
then
i
will
go
with
thank
you
tom
said
the
other
quietly
meredith
ran
into
his
own
room
pressed
an
electric
button
sprang
out
of
his
pyjamas
like
aphrodite
from
the
white
and
began
to
dive
into
his
clothes
with
a
panting
rapidity
astonishingly
foreign
to
his
desire
jim
appeared
in
the
doorway
the
cart
jim
shouted
his
master
we
want
it
like
lightning
tell
the
cook
to
give
harkless
his
breakfast
in
a
hurry
set
a
cup
of
coffee
on
the
table
by
the
front
door
for
me
run
like
the
deuce
got
to
catch
a
that
will
be
quicker
than
any
cab
he
explained
to
harkless
we
break
the
ordinance
against
fast
driving
getting
down
ten
minutes
later
the
cart
swept
away
from
the
house
at
a
gait
which
pained
the
respectable
neighborhood
the
big
horse
plunged
through
the
air
his
ears
laid
flat
toward
his
tail
the
cart
careened
sickeningly
the
face
of
the
servant
clutching
at
the
rail
in
the
rear
was
smeared
with
pallor
as
they
pirouetted
around
curves
on
one
wheel
to
him
it
seemed
they
skirted
the
corners
and
death
simultaneously
and
the
speed
of
their
going
made
a
strong
wind
in
their
faces
harkless
leaned
forward
can
you
make
it
a
little
faster
tom
he
said
they
dashed
up
to
the
station
amid
the
cries
of
people
flying
to
the
walls
for
safety
the
two
gentlemen
leaped
from
the
cart
bore
down
upon
the
stormed
at
the
agent
and
ran
madly
at
the
gates
flourishing
their
passports
the
official
on
duty
eyed
them
wearily
and
barred
the
way
been
gone
two
minutes
he
remarked
with
a
peaceable
yawn
harkless
stamped
his
foot
on
the
cement
flags
then
he
stood
stock
still
gazing
at
the
empty
tracks
but
meredith
turned
to
him
smiling
wo
it
keep
he
asked
yes
it
will
keep
john
answered
part
of
it
may
have
to
keep
till
election
day
but
some
of
it
i
will
settle
before
night
and
that
he
cried
between
his
teeth
and
that
is
the
part
of
it
in
regard
to
young
fisbee
oh
it
about
fisbee
is
it
yes
it
well
we
might
as
well
go
up
and
see
what
the
doctor
thinks
of
you
there
no
i
do
want
to
see
a
doctor
again
ever
as
long
as
i
live
i
as
well
as
tom
burst
out
laughing
and
clapped
his
companion
lightly
on
the
shoulder
his
eyes
dancing
with
pleasure
upon
my
soul
he
cried
i
believe
you
are
it
against
all
my
tradition
and
i
see
i
am
the
gull
of
poetry
for
i
always
believed
it
to
be
beyond
question
that
this
sort
of
miracle
was
wrought
not
by
rage
but
by
the
tenderer
senti
tom
checked
himself
well
take
a
meredith
said
the
other
turning
to
him
gravely
you
may
think
me
a
fool
if
you
will
and
it
likely
i
am
but
i
do
leave
this
station
except
by
train
i
only
two
days
to
work
in
and
every
minute
lessens
our
chances
to
beat
mccune
and
i
have
to
begin
by
wasting
time
on
a
tussle
with
a
traitor
there
another
train
at
eleven
i
do
take
any
chances
on
missing
that
well
well
laughed
his
friend
pushing
him
toward
a
door
by
a
red
and
white
striped
pillar
we
wait
here
if
you
like
but
at
least
go
in
there
and

a
shave

clean
shop

look
your
best
if
you
are
going
down
to
fight

these
then
and
you
will
understand
said
harkless
and
he
thrust
his
three
telegrams
of
the
morning
into
tom
hand
and
disappeared
into
the
when
he
was
gone
meredith
went
to
the
telegraph
office
in
the
station
and
sent
a
line
over
the
wire
to
helen
keep
your
delegation
at

he
coming
on

then
he
read
the
three
telegrams

given
him
they
were
all
from
plattville

chapter
xix
the
great
harkless
comes
home
the
accommodation
train
wandered
languidly
through
the
early
afternoon
sunshine
stopping
at
every
village
and
almost
every
country
on
the
line
the
engine
at
the
road
crossings
and
now
and
again
at
such
junctures
a
farmer
struggling
with
a
team
of
prancing
horses
would
be
seen
or
it
might
be
a
group
of
school
children
homeward
bound
from
seats
of
learning
at
each
station
when
the
train
came
to
a
some
passenger
hanging
head
and
elbows
out
of
his
window
like
a
quilt
draped
over
a
chair
would
address
a
citizen
on
the
platform
hey
sam
how
miz
bushkirk
she
where
milt
this
afternoon
warshing
the
then
at
the
cry
all
see
you
sunday
over
at
you
make
milt
come
i
be
there
shore
so
there
was
an
impatient
passenger
in
the
smoker
who
found
the
stoppages
at
these
wayside
hamlets
interminable
both
in
frequency
and
in
the
delay
at
each
of
them
and
while
the
dawdling
train
remained
inert
and
the
moments
passed
inactive
his
eyes
dilated
and
his
hand
clenched
till
the
nails
bit
his
palm
then
when
the
trucks
groaned
and
the
wheels
crooned
against
the
rails
once
more
he
sank
back
in
his
seat
with
sighs
of
relief
sometimes
he
would
get
up
and
pace
the
aisle
until
his
companion
reminded
him
that
this
was
not
certain
to
hasten
the
hour
of
their
arrival
at
their
destination
i
know
that
answered
the
other
but
i
got
to
beat
by
the
way
observed
meredith
you
left
your
stick
you
do
think
i
need
a
club
to
face
tom
choked
oh
no
i
was
thinking
of
your
giving
fisbee
a
thrashing
i
meant
to
lean
i
do
want
it
i
got
to
walk
lame
all
my
life
but
i
not
going
to
hobble
on
a
tom
looked
at
him
sadly
for
it
was
true
and
the
might
hug
themselves
in
their
cells
over
the
thought
for
the
rest
of
his
life
john
harkless
was
to
walk
with
just
the
limp
they
themselves
would
have
had
if
as
in
former
days
their
sentence
had
been
to
the
ball
and
chain
the
window
was
open
beside
the
two
young
men
and
the
breeze
swept
in
fresh
from
the
wide
fields
there
was
a
tang
in
the
air
it
soothed
like
a
balm
but
there
was
a
spur
to
energy
and
heartiness
in
its
crispness
the
wholesome
touch
of
fall
john
looked
out
over
the
boundless
aisles
of
corn
that
stood
higher
than
a
tall
man
could
reach
long
waves
rippled
across
them
here
where
the
cry
of
the
brave
had
rung
in
forest
glades
where
the
painted
tribes
had
hastened
were
marshalled
the
tasselled
armies
of
peace
and
beyond
these
where
the
train
ran
between
shadowy
groves
delicate
landscape
vistas
framed
in
branches
opened
closed
and
succeeded
each
other
and
then
the
travellers
were
carried
out
into
the
level
open
again
and
the
intensely
blue
september
skies
ran
down
to
the
low
horizon
meeting
the
tossing
plumes
of
corn
it
takes
a
long
time
for
the
full
beauty
of
the
flat
lands
to
reach
a
man
soul
once
there
nor
hills
nor
sea
nor
growing
fan
leaves
of
palm
shall
suffice
him
it
is
like
the
beauty
in
the
word
it
may
be
that
there
are
people
who
do
not
consider
indiana
a
beautiful
word
but
once
it
rings
true
in
your
ears
it
has
a
richer
sound
than
there
was
a
newness
in
the
atmosphere
that
day
a
bright
invigoration
that
set
the
blood
tingling
the
hot
months
were
done
with
languor
was
routed
autumn
spoke
to
industry
told
of
the
sowing
of
another
harvest
of
the
tawny
shock
of
the
purple
grape
of
the
red
apple
and
called
upon
muscle
and
laughter
breathed
gaiety
into
men
hearts
the
little
stations
hummed
with
bustle
and
noise
big
farm
wagons
rattled
away
and
raced
with
or
omnibus
people
walked
with
quick
steps
the
called
cheerily
to
the
trainmen
and
the
brakemen
laughed
to
rollicking
girls
as
they
left
gainesville
three
children
clad
in
calico
barefoot
and
bareheaded
came
romping
out
of
a
log
cabin
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
waved
their
hands
to
the
passengers
they
climbed
on
the
sagging
gate
in
front
of
their
humble
domain
and
laughed
for
joy
to
see
the
monstrous
caravan
come
clattering
out
of
the
unknown
bearing
the
faces
by
the
smallest
child
a
little
cherubic
whose
cheeks
were
smeared
with
clean
earth
and
the
tracks
of
forgotten
tears
stood
upright
on
a
and
blew
the
most
impudent
of
kisses
to
the
strangers
on
a
journey
beyond
this
they
came
into
a
great
plain
acres
and
acres
of
green
where
the
wheat
had
grown
all
so
flat
one
thought
of
an
enormous
billiard
table
and
now
where
the
railroad
crossed
the
country
roads
they
saw
the
staunch
brown
thistle
sometimes
the
sumach
and
always
the
graceful
slender
tall
proud
bowing
a
head
or
shaking
in
an
agony
of
fright
when
it
stood
too
close
to
the
train
the
fields
like
great
flat
emeralds
set
in
new
metal
were
bordered
with
and
at
sight
of
this
the
heart
leaped
for
the
is
a
symbol
of
stored
granaries
of
ripe
sheaves
of
the
kindness
of
the
season
generously
given
and
abundantly
received
more
it
is
the
token
of
a
land
of
promise
and
of
bounteous
fulfilment
and
the
plant
stains
its
blossom
with
yellow
so
that
when
it
falls
it
pays
tribute
to
the
ground
which
has
nourished
it
from
the
plain
they
passed
again
into
a
thick
wood
where
ruddy
arrows
of
the
sun
glinted
among
the
boughs
and
here
and
there
one
saw
a
courtly
maple
or
royal
oak
wearing
a
gala
mantle
of
crimson
and
pale
brown
gallants
of
the
forest
preparing
early
for
the
october
masquerade
when
they
should
hold
wanton
carnival
before
they
stripped
them
of
their
finery
for
pious
gray
and
when
the
coughing
engine
drew
them
to
the
borders
of
this
wood
they
rolled
out
into
another
rich
plain
of
green
and
corn
and
far
to
the
south
john
harkless
marked
a
winding
procession
of
sycamores
which
he
knew
followed
the
course
of
a
slender
stream
and
the
waters
of
the
stream
flowed
by
a
bank
where
wild
thyme
might
have
grown
and
where
beyond
an
orchard
and
a
a
rustic
bench
was
placed
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
and
the
name
of
the
stream
was
hibbard
creek
here
the
land
lay
flatter
than
elsewhere
the
sky
came
closer
with
a
gentler
benediction
the
breeze
blew
in
laden
with
keener
spices
there
was
the
flavor
of
apples
and
the
smell
of
the
walnut
and
a
hint
of
coming
frost
the
immeasurable
earth
lay
more
patiently
to
await
the
husbandman
and
the
whole
world
seemed
to
extend
flat
in
line
with
the
eye
for
this
was
carlow
county
all
at
once
the
anger
ran
out
of
john
harkless
he
was
a
hard
man
for
anger
to
tarry
with
and
in
place
of
it
a
strong
sense
of
began
to
take
possession
of
him
he
was
going
home
back
to
plattville
where
i
belong
he
had
said
and
he
said
it
again
without
bitterness
for
it
was
the
truth
every
man
cometh
to
his
own
place
in
the
yes
as
one
leaves
a
gay
acquaintance
of
the
playhouse
lobby
for
some
tried
old
friend
so
he
would
wave
the
outer
world
and
come
back
to
the
old
ways
of
carlow
what
though
the
years
were
dusty
he
had
his
friends
and
his
memories
and
his
old
black
brier
pipe
he
had
a
girl
picture
that
he
should
carry
in
his
heart
till
his
last
day
and
if
his
life
was
sadder
it
was
infinitely
richer
for
it
his
winter
fireside
should
be
not
so
lonely
for
her
sake
and
losing
her
he
lost
not
everything
for
he
had
the
rare
blessing
of
having
known
her
and
what
man
could
wish
to
be
healed
of
such
a
hurt
far
better
to
have
had
it
than
to
trot
a
smug
pace
unscathed
he
had
been
a
dullard
he
had
lain
prostrate
in
the
wretchedness
of
his
loss
a
girl
you
could
put
in
your
hat
and
there
you
have
a
strong
man
he
had
been
a
sluggard
weary
of
himself
unfit
to
fight
a
failure
in
life
and
a
failure
in
love
that
was
ended
he
was
tired
of
failing
and
it
was
time
to
succeed
for
a
while
to
accept
the
worst
that
fate
can
deal
and
to
wring
courage
from
it
instead
of
despair
that
is
success
and
it
was
the
success
that
he
would
have
he
would
take
fate
by
the
neck
but
had
it
done
him
unkindness
he
looked
out
over
the
beautiful
monotonous
landscape
and
he
answered
heartily
no
there
was
ignorance
in
man
but
no
unkindness
were
man
utterly
wise
he
were
utterly
kind
the
had
not
known
better
that
was
all
the
unfolding
aisles
of
corn
swam
pleasantly
before
john
eyes
the
earth
hearkened
to
man
wants
and
answered
the
clement
sun
and
summer
rains
hastened
the
fruition
yonder
stood
the
brown
haystack
garnered
to
feed
the
industrious
horse
who
had
earned
his
meed
there
was
the
shelter
for
the
cattle
how
the
orchard
boughs
bent
with
their
burdens
the
big
red
barns
stood
stored
with
the
harvested
wheat
and
beyond
the
tall
trees
rose
against
the
benign
sky
to
feed
the
glance
of
a
dreamer
the
fertile
soil
lay
lavender
and
glossy
in
the
furrow
the
farmhouses
were
warmly
built
and
hale
and
strong
no
winter
blast
should
rage
so
bitterly
as
to
shake
them
or
scatter
the
hospitable
embers
on
the
hearth
for
this
was
carlow
county
and
he
was
coming
home
they
crossed
a
an
old
man
with
a
streaky
gray
was
sitting
on
a
sack
of
oats
in
a
seatless
wagon
waiting
for
the
train
to
pass
harkless
seized
his
companion
excitedly
by
the
elbow
tommy
he
cried
it
kim
fentriss
look
did
you
see
that
old
fellow
i
saw
a
particularly
uninterested
and
uninteresting
gentleman
sitting
on
a
bag
replied
his
friend
why
that
old
kimball
fentriss
he
going
to
town
he
lives
on
the
edge
of
the
can
this
be
true
said
meredith
gravely
i
wonder
said
harkless
thoughtfully
a
few
moments
later
i
wonder
why
he
had
them
changed
who
changed
around
the
team
he
always
used
to
drive
the
bay
on
the
near
side
and
the
sorrel
on
the
and
at
present
rejoined
meredith
i
am
to
understand
that
he
is
driving
the
sorrel
on
the
near
side
and
bay
on
the
off
that
it
returned
the
other
he
must
have
worked
them
like
that
for
some
time
because
they
did
look
uneasy
they
all
right
about
the
train
those
two
i
seen
them
stand
with
their
heads
almost
against
a
fast
freight
see
there
he
pointed
to
a
white
frame
farmhouse
with
green
blinds
that
win
hibbard
we
just
outside
of
beaver
elucidate
beaver
boy
beaver
meredith
your
information
ends
at
home
what
do
you
know
of
your
own
state
if
you
are
ignorant
of
beaver
beaver
is
that
city
of
carlow
county
next
in
importance
and
population
to
tom
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
i
fancy
you
are
right
he
said
i
already
see
five
people
meredith
had
observed
the
change
in
his
companion
mood
he
had
watched
him
closely
all
day
looking
for
a
return
of
his
malady
but
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
in
truth
a
miracle
had
been
wrought
for
the
lethargy
was
gone
and
vigor
seemed
to
increase
in
harkless
with
every
turn
of
the
wheels
that
brought
them
nearer
plattville
and
the
nearer
they
drew
to
plattville
the
higher
the
spirits
of
both
the
young
men
rose
meredith
knew
what
was
happening
there
and
he
began
to
be
a
little
excited
as
he
had
said
there
were
five
people
visible
at
beaver
and
he
wondered
where
they
lived
as
the
only
building
in
sight
was
the
station
and
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
he
walked
out
to
the
vestibule
the
little
station
stood
in
deep
woods
and
brown
leaves
whirled
along
the
platform
one
of
the
five
people
was
an
old
lady
and
she
entered
a
rear
car
the
other
four
were
men
one
of
them
handed
the
conductor
a
telegram
meredith
heard
the
official
say
all
right
decorate
ahead
i
hold
it
five
the
man
sprang
up
the
steps
of
the
smoker
and
looked
in
he
turned
to
meredith
do
you
know
if
that
gentleman
in
the
gray
coat
is
harkless
he
got
his
back
this
way
and
i
do
want
to
go
inside
the
the
air
in
a
smoker
always
gives
me
a
yes
that
the
man
jumped
to
the
platform
all
right
boys
he
said
rip
her
the
doors
of
the
were
thrown
open
and
a
big
bundle
of
colored
stuffs
was
dragged
out
and
hastily
unfolded
one
of
the
men
ran
to
the
further
end
of
the
car
with
a
strip
of
red
white
and
blue
bunting
and
tacked
it
securely
while
another
fastened
the
other
extremity
to
the
railing
of
the
steps
by
meredith
the
two
companions
of
this
pair
performed
the
same
operation
with
another
strip
on
the
other
side
of
the
car
they
ran
similar
strips
of
bunting
along
the
roof
from
end
to
end
so
that
except
for
the
windows
the
car
was
completely
covered
by
the
national
colors
then
they
draped
the
vestibules
with
flags
it
was
all
done
in
a
trice
meredith
heart
was
beating
fast
what
it
all
about
he
asked
picnic
down
the
line
answered
the
man
in
charge
removing
a
tack
from
his
mouth
he
motioned
to
the
conductor
go
the
wheels
began
to
move
the
decorators
remained
on
the
platform
letting
the
train
pass
them
but
meredith
craning
his
neck
from
the
steps
saw
that
they
jumped
on
the
last
car
what
the
celebration
asked
harkless
when
meredith
returned
picnic
down
the
line
said
meredith
nipping
weather
for
a
picnic
a
little
cool
do
you
think
one
of
those
fellows
looked
like
a
friend
of
mine
homer
tibbs
or
as
homer
might
look
if
he
were
in
disgrace
he
had
his
hat
hung
on
his
eyes
and
he
slouched
like
a
thief
in
melodrama
as
he
tacked
up
the
bunting
on
this
side
of
the
he
continued
to
point
out
various
familiar
places
finally
breaking
out
enthusiastically
as
they
drew
nearer
the
town
hello
look
there
beyond
the
grove
yonder
see
that
house
yes
that
the
bowlders
you
got
to
know
the
i
like
the
kindest
people
in
the
world
the
briscoe
house
we
ca
see
because
it
so
shut
in
by
trees
and
besides
it
a
mile
or
so
ahead
of
us

out
there
for
supper
do

briscoe
he

best

judd
bennett
in
the
omnibus
and
you
know
how
a
machine
gun
sounds
i
want
to
go
straight
to
the
office
he
finished
with
a
suddenly
darkening
brow
after
all
there
may
be
some
explanation
meredith
suggested
with
a
little
hesitancy
h
fisbee
might
turn
out
more
honest
than
you
harkless
threw
his
head
back
and
laughed
it
was
the
first
time
meredith
had
heard
him
laugh
since
the
night
of
the
dance
in
the
country
honest
a
man
in
the
pay
of
rodney
mccune
well
we
can
let
it
wait
till
we
get
there
listen
there
the
whistle
that
means
we
getting
near
home
by
heaven
there
an
so
it
and
another
three
five
seven
seven
in
sight
at
once
they
tried
it
three
miles
south
and
failed
but
you
ca
fool
eph
watts
bless
him
i
want
you
to
know
they
were
running
by
the
outlying
houses
of
the
town
amidst
a
thousand
descriptive
exclamations
from
harkless
who
wished
meredith
to
meet
every
one
in
carlow
but
he
came
to
a
pause
in
the
middle
of
a
word
do
you
hear
music
he
asked
abruptly
or
is
it
only
the
rhythm
of
the
ties
it
seems
to
me
there
music
in
the
air
answered
his
companion
been
fancying
i
heard
it
for
a
minute
or
so
there
no
yes
it
a
band
is
it
no
what
would
a
band
the
train
slowed
up
and
stopped
at
a
watertank
two
hundred
yards
east
of
the
station
and
their
uncertainty
was
at
an
end
from
somewhere
down
the
track
came
the
detonating
boom
of
a
cannon
there
was
a
dash
of
brass
and
the
travellers
became
aware
of
a
band
playing
marching
through
meredith
laid
his
hand
on
his
companion
shoulder
john
he
said
john
the
cannon
fired
again
and
there
came
a
cheer
from
three
thousand
throats
the
shouters
all
unseen
the
engine
coughed
and
panted
the
train
rolled
on
and
in
another
minute
it
had
stopped
alongside
the
station
in
the
midst
of
a
riotous
jam
of
happy
people
who
were
waving
flags
and
banners
and
handkerchiefs
and
tossing
their
hats
high
in
the
air
and
shouting
themselves
hoarse
the
band
played
in
dumb
show
it
could
not
hear
itself
play
the
people
came
at
the
smoker
like
a
long
wave
and
warren
smith
briscoe
keating
and
bence
of
gaines
were
swept
ahead
of
it
before
the
train
stopped
they
had
rushed
eagerly
up
the
steps
and
entered
the
car
harkless
was
on
his
feet
and
started
to
meet
them
he
stopped
what
does
it
mean
he
said
and
began
to
grow
pale
is
halloway
did
mccune
have
you
warren
smith
seized
one
of
his
hands
and
briscoe
the
other
what
does
it
mean
cried
warren
it
means
that
you
were
nominated
for
congress
at
five
minutes
after
this
on
the
second
ballot
shouted
the
judge
just
as
young
fisbee
planned
it
weeks
it
was
one
of
the
great
crowds
of
carlow
history
they
had
known
since
morning
that
he
was
coming
home
and
the
gentlemen
of
the
reception
committee
had
some
busy
hours
but
long
before
the
train
arrived
everything
was
ready
homer
tibbs
had
done
his
work
well
at
beaver
and
the
veterans
of
a
battery
carlow
had
sent
out
in
had
placed
their
worn
old
gun
in
position
to
fire
salutes
at
immediately
after
the
nomination
had
been
made
unanimous
the
harkless
clubs
of
carlow
amo
and
gaines
secretly
organized
during
the
quiet
agitation
preceding
the
convention
formed
on
parade
in
the
yard
and
with
the
plattville
band
at
their
head
paraded
the
streets
to
the
station
to
make
sure
of
being
on
hand
when
the
train
arrived
it
was
due
in
a
couple
of
hours
there
they
were
joined
by
an
increasing
number
of
glad
enthusiasts
all
noisy
exhilarated
with
shouting
and
patriotically
happy
as
bence
himself
the
spoiled
child
of
another
county
generously
said
in
a
speech
which
with
no
outrageous
pressure
he
was
induced
to
make
during
the
long
wait
the
favorite
son
of
carlow
is
returning
to
his
lares
and
penates
like
another
cincinnatus
accepting
the
call
of
the
people
and
for
the
first
time
in
sixteen
years
carlow
shall
have
a
representative
to
bear
the
banner
of
this
district
and
the
flaming
torch
of
progress
sweeping
on
to
washington
and
triumph
like
a
speedy
galleon
of
old
and
his
friends
are
here
to
take
his
hand
and
do
him
homage
and
the
number
of
his
friends
is
as
the
number
given
in
the
last
census
of
the
population
of
the
counties
of
this
district
and
indeed
in
this
estimate
the
speaker
seemed
guilty
of
no
great
exaggeration
a
never
intermittent
procession
of
pedestrians
and
vehicles
made
its
way
to
the
station
and
every
wagon
buckboard
buggy
and
had
its
flags
or
bunting
or
streamer
of
ribbons
tied
to
the
whip
the
excitement
increased
as
the
time
grew
shorter
those
on
foot
struggled
for
better
positions
and
the
people
in
wagons
and
carriages
stood
upon
seats
while
the
pedestrians
besieged
them
climbing
on
the
wheels
or
balancing
recklessly
with
feet
on
the
hubs
of
opposite
wagons
everybody
was
bound
to
see
when
the
whistle
announced
the
coming
of
the
train
the
band
began
to
play
the
cannon
fired
horns
blew
and
the
cheering
echoed
and
reechoed
till
vault
resounded
with
the
noise
the
people
of
carlow
were
making
there
was
one
heart
which
almost
stopped
beating
helen
was
standing
on
the
front
seat
of
the
briscoe
buckboard
with
minnie
beside
her
and
at
the
commotion
the
horses
pranced
and
backed
so
that
lige
willetts
ran
to
hold
them
but
she
did
not
notice
the
frightened
roans
nor
did
she
know
that
minnie
clutched
her
round
the
waist
to
keep
her
from
falling
her
eyes
were
fixed
intently
on
the
smoke
of
the
engine
and
her
hand
lifted
to
her
face
in
an
uncertain
tremulous
fashion
as
it
was
one
day
in
a
circus
tent
pressed
against
the
deepest
blush
that
ever
mantled
a
girl
cheek
when
the
train
reached
the
platform
she
saw
briscoe
and
the
others
rush
into
the
car
and
there
ensued
what
was
to
her
an
almost
intolerable
pause
of
expectation
while
the
crowd
besieged
the
windows
of
the
smoker
leaning
up
and
climbing
on
each
other
shoulders
to
catch
the
first
glimpse
of
briscoe
and
a
young
man
a
stranger
to
plattville
came
down
the
steps
laughing
like
boys
and
then
keating
and
bence
and
then
warren
smith
as
the
lawyer
reached
the
platform
he
turned
toward
the
door
of
the
car
and
waved
his
hand
as
in
welcome
here
he
is
boys
he
shouted
welcome
home
at
that
it
was
as
if
all
the
noise
that
had
gone
before
had
been
mere
leakage
of
enthusiasm
a
thousand
horns
blared
deafeningly
the
whistles
of
the
engine
and
of
hibbard
mill
were
added
to
the
din
the
bell
was
pealing
out
a
welcome
and
the
church
bells
were
ringing
the
cannon
thundered
and
then
cheer
on
cheer
shook
the
air
as
john
harkless
came
out
under
the
flags
and
passed
down
the
steps
of
the
car
when
helen
saw
him
over
the
heads
of
the
people
and
through
a
flying
tumult
of
flags
and
hats
and
handkerchiefs
she
gave
one
frightened
glance
about
her
and
jumped
down
from
her
high
perch
and
sank
into
the
back
seat
of
the
buckboard
with
her
burning
face
turned
from
the
station
and
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
she
wanted
to
run
away
as
she
had
run
from
him
the
first
time
she
had
ever
seen
him
then
as
now
he
came
in
triumph
hailed
by
the
plaudits
of
his
fellows
and
now
as
on
that
day
of
her
young
girlhood
he
was
borne
high
over
the
heads
of
the
people
for
minnie
cried
to
her
to
look
they
were
carrying
him
on
their
shoulders
to
his
carriage
she
had
had
only
that
brief
glimpse
of
him
before
he
was
lost
in
the
crowd
that
was
so
glad
to
get
him
back
again
and
so
proud
of
him
but
she
had
seen
that
he
looked
very
white
and
solemn
briscoe
and
tom
meredith
made
their
way
through
the
crowd
and
climbed
into
the
buckboard
all
right
lige
called
the
judge
to
willetts
who
was
at
the
horses
heads
you
go
get
into
line
with
the
boys
they
want
you
we
go
down
on
main
street
to
see
the
parade
he
explained
to
the
ladies
gathering
the
reins
in
his
hand
he
clucked
to
the
roans
and
by
dint
of
backing
and
twisting
and
turning
and
a
hundred
intricate
manoeuvres
accompanied
by
entreaties
and
remonstrances
and
objurgations
addressed
to
the
occupants
of
surrounding
vehicles
he
managed
to
extricate
the
buckboard
from
the
press
and
once
free
the
team
went
down
the
road
toward
main
street
at
a
lively
gait
the
judge
call
to
the
colts
rang
out
cheerily
his
handsome
face
was
one
broad
smile
this
is
a
big
day
for
carlow
he
said
i
do
remember
a
better
day
work
in
twenty
did
you
tell
him
about
halloway
asked
helen
leaning
forward
anxiously
warren
told
him
before
we
left
the
car
answered
briscoe
he
have
declined
on
the
spot
i
expect
if
we
had
made
him
sure
it
was
all
right
with
if
i
understood
what
smith
was
saying
halloway
must
have
behaved
very
well
said
meredith
the
judge
laughed
he
saw
it
was
the
only
way
to
beat
mccune
and
have
given
his
life
and
harkless
too
rather
than
let
mccune
have
why
did
you
stay
with
him
tom
asked
helen
with
halloway
i
do
know
one
forgives
a
generous
hilarity
anything
even
such
quips
as
that
she
retorted
why
did
you
not
stay
with
harkless
that
very
hospitable
of
you
laughed
the
young
man
you
forget
that
i
have
the
felicity
to
sit
at
your
side
judge
briscoe
has
been
kind
enough
to
ask
me
to
review
the
procession
from
his
buckboard
and
to
sup
at
his
house
with
other
distinguished
visitors
and
i
have
but
did
he
wish
you
to
remain
with
him
but
this
second
i
had
the
honor
to
inform
you
that
i
am
here
distinctly
by
his
precisely

miss
sherwood
will
not
believe
that
you
desire
my
presence
if
i
intrude
pray
let
me
he
made
as
if
to
spring
from
the
buckboard
and
the
girl
seized
his
arm
impatiently
you
are
a
pitiful
she
cried
and
for
some
reason
this
speech
made
him
turn
his
glasses
upon
her
gravely
her
lashes
fell
before
his
gaze
and
at
that
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
quickly
no
no
she
faltered
you
must
not
think
it
it
is
you
see
i
there
is
nothing
you
shall
not
dull
the
edge
of
my
hilarity
he
answered
especially
since
so
much
may
be
forgiven
why
did
you
leave
harkless
she
asked
without
raising
her
eyes
my
dear
girl
he
replied
because
for
some
inexplicable
reason
my
lady
cousin
has
not
nominated
me
for
congress
but
instead
has
chosen
to
bestow
that
distinction
upon
another
and
i
may
say
an
unworthier
and
unfitter
man
than
i
and
oddly
enough
the
multitude
were
not
cheering
for
me
the
artillery
was
not
in
action
to
celebrate
me
the
band
was
not
playing
to
do
me
honor
therefore
why
should
i
ride
in
the
midst
of
a
procession
that
knows
me
not
why
should
i
enthrone
me
in
an
open
barouche
a
little
faded
and
possibly
not
quite
secure
as
to
its
springs
but
still
a
barouche
with
four
white
horses
to
draw
it
and
draped
with
silken
flags
both
barouche
and
steeds
since
these
things
were
not
for
me
i
flew
to
your
side
to
dissemble
my
spleen
under
the
licensed
prattle
of
a
then
who
with
him
the
population
of
this
portion
of
our
state
i
take
oh
it
all
right
said
the
judge
leaning
back
to
speak
to
helen
keating
and
smith
and
your
father
are
to
ride
in
the
carriage
with
him
you
need
be
afraid
of
any
of
them
letting
him
know
that
fisbee
is
a
lady
everybody
understands
about
that
of
course
they
know
it
to
be
left
to
you
to
break
it
to
him
how
well
a
girl
has
run
his
the
old
gentleman
chuckled
and
looked
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
at
his
daughter
whose
expression
was
inscrutable
i
cried
helen
tell
him
no
one
must
tell
him
he
need
never
know
briscoe
reached
back
and
patted
her
cheek
how
long
do
you
suppose
he
will
be
here
in
plattville
without
it
leaking
out
but
they
kept
guard
over
him
for
months
and
nobody
told
ah
said
briscoe
but
this
is
no
no
no
she
exclaimed
it
be
kept
from
him
somehow
he
know
it
by
so
you
better
tell
him
this
this
evening
yes
you
have
a
good
i
will
he
coming
to
supper
with
us
he
and
your
father
of
course
and
keating
and
bence
and
boswell
and
smith
and
tom
martin
and
lige
going
to
have
a
big
time
with
you
and
minnie
to
do
the
honors
and
we
all
coming
into
town
afterwards
for
the
fireworks
i
let
him
drive
you
in
the
phaeton
you
have
plenty
of
time
to
talk
it
over
with
him
and
tell
him
all
about
helen
gave
a
little
gasp
never
she
cried
never
the
buckboard
stopped
on
the
herald
corner
and
here
and
along
main
street
the
line
of
vehicles
which
had
followed
it
from
the
station
took
their
places
the
square
was
almost
a
solid
mass
of
bunting
and
the
north
entrance
of
the
had
been
decorated
with
streamers
and
flags
so
as
to
make
it
a
sort
of
stand
hither
the
crowd
was
already
streaming
and
hither
the
procession
made
its
way
at
intervals
the
cannon
boomed
and
schofields
henry
was
winnowing
the
air
with
his
bell
nobody
had
a
better
time
that
day
than
schofields
henry
except
old
wilkerson
who
was
with
the
procession
in
advance
came
the
boys
whooping
and
somersaulting
and
behind
them
rode
a
band
of
mounted
men
sitting
their
horses
like
cavalrymen
led
by
the
sheriff
and
his
deputy
and
jim
bardlock
then
followed
the
harkless
club
of
amo
led
by
boswell
with
the
magnanimous
halloway
himself
marching
in
the
ranks
and
at
sight
of
this
the
people
shouted
like
madmen
but
when
helen
eye
fell
upon
his
fat
rather
unhappy
face
she
felt
a
pang
of
pity
and
unreasoning
remorse
which
warned
her
that
he
who
looks
upon
politics
when
it
is
red
must
steel
his
eyes
to
see
many
a
man
with
the
after
the
men
of
amo
came
the
harkless
club
of
gainesville
bence
in
the
van
with
the
step
of
a
grenadier
there
followed
next
ephraim
watts
bearing
a
light
wand
in
his
hand
and
leading
a
detachment
of
workers
from
the
in
their
stained
blue
overalls
and
blouses
and
after
them
came
martin
and
landis
at
the
head
of
an
organization
recognized
in
the
order
of
procession
printed
in
the
herald
as
the
business
men
of
plattville
they
played
in
such
magnificent
time
that
every
foot
in
all
the
line
came
down
with
the
same
jubilant
plunk
and
lifted
again
with
a
unanimity
as
complete
as
that
of
the
last
vote
the
convention
had
taken
that
day
the
leaders
of
the
procession
set
a
brisk
pace
and
who
could
have
set
any
other
kind
of
a
pace
when
on
parade
to
the
strains
of
such
a
band
playing
such
a
tune
as
a
new
coon
in
town
with
all
its
might
and
main
but
as
the
line
swung
into
the
square
there
came
a
moment
when
the
tune
was
ended
the
musicians
paused
for
breath
and
there
fell
comparative
quiet
amongst
the
ranks
of
business
men
ambled
wilkerson
singing
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
now
he
could
be
heard
distinctly
enough
for
those
near
to
him
to
distinguish
the
melody
with
which
it
was
his
intention
to
favor
the
public
glory
glory
hallelujah
as
we
go
marching
the
words
the
air
that
husky
voice
recalled
to
the
men
of
carlow
another
day
and
another
procession
not
like
this
one
and
the
song
wilkerson
was
singing
is
the
one
song
every
american
knows
and
can
sing
the
leader
of
the
band
caught
the
sound
signalled
to
his
men
twenty
instruments
rose
as
one
to
twenty
mouths
the
rattled
the
big
drum
crashed
the
leader
lifted
his
baton
high
over
his
head
and
music
burst
from
twenty
brazen
throats
glory
glory
hallelujah
instantaneously
the
whole
procession
began
to
sing
the
refrain
and
the
people
in
the
street
and
those
in
the
wagons
and
carriages
and
those
leaning
from
the
windows
joined
with
one
accord
the
ringing
bells
caught
the
time
of
the
song
and
the
upper
air
reverberated
in
the
rhythm
the
harkless
club
of
carlow
wheeled
into
main
street
two
hundred
strong
with
their
banners
and
transparencies
lige
willetts
rode
at
their
head
and
behind
him
strode
young
william
todd
and
parker
and
ross
schofield
and
homer
tibbs
and
hartley
bowlder
and
even
bud
tipworthy
held
a
place
in
the
ranks
through
his
connection
with
the
they
were
all
singing
and
behind
them
helen
saw
the
barouche
and
her
father
and
beside
him
sat
john
harkless
with
his
head
bared
she
glanced
at
briscoe
he
was
standing
on
the
front
seat
with
minnie
beside
him
and
both
were
singing
meredith
had
climbed
upon
the
back
seat
and
was
nervously
fumbling
at
a
cigarette
sing
tom
the
girl
cried
to
him
excitedly
i
should
be
ashamed
not
to
he
answered
and
dropped
the
cigarette
and
began
to
sing
john
brown
body
with
all
his
strength
with
that
she
seized
his
hand
sprang
up
beside
him
and
over
the
swelling
chorus
her
full
soprano
rose
lifted
with
all
the
power
in
her
the
barouche
rolled
into
the
square
and
as
it
passed
harkless
turned
and
bent
a
sudden
gaze
upon
the
group
in
the
buckboard
but
the
western
sun
was
in
his
eyes
and
he
only
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
vague
bright
shape
and
a
dazzle
of
gold
and
he
was
borne
along
and
out
of
view
down
the
singing
street
glory
glory
hallelujah
glory
glory
hallelujah
glory
glory
hallelujah
as
we
go
marching
on
the
barouche
stopped
in
front
of
the
courthouse
and
he
passed
up
a
lane
they
made
for
him
to
the
steps
when
he
turned
to
them
to
speak
they
began
to
cheer
again
and
he
had
to
wait
for
them
to
quiet
down
we
ca
hear
him
from
over
here
said
briscoe
we
too
far
off
meredith
suppose
you
take
the
ladies
closer
in
and
i
stay
with
the
horses
you
want
to
hear
his
he
is
a
great
man
is
he
meredith
said
to
helen
gravely
as
he
handed
her
out
of
the
buckboard
i
been
trying
to
realize
for
the
last
few
minutes
that
he
is
the
same
old
fellow
i
been
treating
so
familiarly
all
day
yes
he
is
a
great
man
she
answered
this
is
only
the
that
true
said
briscoe
who
had
overheard
her
he
go
pretty
far
a
man
that
people
know
is
steady
and
strong
and
can
get
whatever
he
wants
because
a
public
man
can
get
anything
if
people
know
he
safe
and
honest
and
they
can
rely
on
him
for
it
sounds
like
a
simple
matter
but
only
three
or
four
public
men
in
the
country
have
convinced
us
that
they
are
like
that
hurry
along
young
crossing
the
street
they
met
miss
tibbs
she
was
wiping
her
streaming
eyes
with
the
back
of
her
left
hand
and
still
mechanically
waving
her
handkerchief
with
her
right
is
it
beautiful
she
said
not
ceasing
to
flutter
unconsciously
the
little
square
of
cambric
there
was
such
a
throng
that
i
grew
faint
and
had
to
come
away
i
do
mind
your
seeing
me
crying
pretty
near
everybody
cried
when
he
walked
up
to
the
steps
and
we
saw
that
he
was
standing
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
they
could
hear
the
mellow
ring
of
harkless
voice
but
only
fragments
of
the
speech
for
it
was
rather
halting
and
was
not
altogether
clear
in
either
rhetoric
or
delivery
and
bence
could
have
been
a
good
deal
longer
in
saying
what
he
had
to
say
and
a
thousand
times
more
oratorical
nevertheless
there
was
not
a
man
or
woman
present
who
did
not
declare
that
it
was
the
greatest
speech
ever
heard
in
plattville
and
they
really
thought
so
to
such
lengths
are
loyalty
and
friendship
sometimes
carried
in
carlow
and
amo
and
gaines
he
looked
down
upon
the
attentive
earnest
faces
and
into
the
kindly
eyes
of
the
hoosier
country
people
and
as
he
spoke
the
thought
kept
recurring
to
him
that
this
was
the
place
he
had
dreaded
to
come
back
to
that
these
were
the
people
he
had
wished
to
leave
these
who
gave
him
everything
they
had
to
give
and
this
made
it
difficult
to
keep
his
tones
steady
and
his
throat
clear
helen
stood
so
far
from
the
steps
nor
could
she
be
induced
to
penetrate
further
though
they
would
have
made
way
for
her
that
only
fragments
reached
her
but
what
she
heard
she
remembered
i
have
come
home
ordinarily
a
man
needs
to
fall
sick
by
the
wayside
or
to
be
set
upon
by
thieves
in
order
to
realize
that
of
the
world
is
samaritan
and
the
other
tenth
only
too
busy
or
too
ignorant
to
be
down
here
he
realizes
it
with
no
necessity
of
illness
or
wounds
to
bring
it
out
and
if
he
does
get
hurt
you
send
him
to
congress
there
will
be
no
other
in
washington
so
proud
of
what
he
stands
for
as
i
shall
be
to
represent
you
is
to
stand
for
realities
fearlessness
honor
kindness
we
are
people
who
take
what
comes
to
us
and
it
comes
bountifully
we
are
rich
oh
we
are
all
americans
here
this
is
the
place
for
a
man
who
likes
to
live
where
people
are
kind
to
one
another
and
where
they
have
the
way
of
saying
other
places
they
do
seem
to
get
so
much
into
it
as
we
do
and
to
come
home
as
i
have
i
have
come
home
every
one
meant
to
shake
hands
with
him
and
when
the
speech
was
over
those
nearest
swooped
upon
him
cheering
and
waving
and
grasping
at
his
hand
then
a
line
was
formed
and
they
began
to
defile
by
him
as
he
stood
on
the
steps
and
one
by
one
they
came
up
and
gave
him
hearty
greetings
and
passed
on
through
the
and
out
at
the
south
door
tom
meredith
and
minnie
briscoe
came
amongst
the
others
and
tom
said
only
good
old
boy
as
he
squeezed
his
friend
hand
and
then
as
he
went
down
the
hall
wiping
his
glasses
he
asked
minnie
if
she
believed
the
young
man
on
the
steps
had
risen
from
a
sick
bed
that
morning
it
was
when
harkless
climbed
the
stairs
to
the
herald
office
and
his
right
arm
and
hand
were
aching
and
limp
below
him
as
he
reached
the
landing
he
could
see
boys
selling
extras
containing
his
speech
taken
by
the
new
reporter
and
long
accounts
of
the
convention
of
the
nominee
career
and
the
celebration
of
his
the
sales
were
rapid
for
no
one
could
resist
the
opportunity
to
read
in
print
descriptions
of
what
his
eyes
had
beheld
and
his
ears
had
heard
that
day
ross
schofield
was
the
only
person
in
the
editorial
room
and
there
was
nothing
in
his
appearance
which
should
cause
a
man
to
start
and
fall
back
from
the
doorway
but
that
was
what
harkless
did
what
the
matter
harkless
cried
ross
hurrying
forward
fearing
that
the
other
had
been
suddenly
reseized
by
illness
what
are
those
asked
harkless
with
a
gesture
of
his
hand
which
seemed
to
include
the
entire
room
those
repeated
ross
staring
blankly
those
rosettes
these
streamers
that
stovepipe
all
this
blue
ross
turned
pale
ribbon
he
said
inquiringly
ribbon
he
seemed
unable
to
perceive
the
decorations
referred
to
yes
answered
john
these
rosettes
on
the
chairs
that
band
and
oh
ross
exclaimed
that
he
fingered
the
band
on
the
stovepipe
as
if
he
saw
it
for
the
first
time
yes
i
but
what
are
they
for
asked
harkless
touching
one
of
the
streamers
curiously
why
it
it
likely
meant
for
john
picked
up
the
staring
in
complete
amazement
at
the
hard
knot
of
ribbon
with
which
it
was
garnished
they
seem
to
have
been
here
some
they
have
i
reckon
they
almost
due
to
be
called
in
they
up
ever
sence
sence
who
put
them
up

what
for
ross
was
visibly
embarrassed

other

ross

fisbee

he
appreciate
them
well
he
seemed
to
kind
of
like

speak
of
had
ort
to
be
very
hard
to
find
in
carlow
the
committee
was
reckless
enough
to
hire
that
carriage
of
yours
by
the
day
and
keating
and
warren
smith
are
setting
in
it
up
at
the
corner
with
their
feet
on
the
cushions
to
show
they
used
to
ridin
around
with
four
white
horses
every
day
in
the
week
it
waitin
till
you
ready
to
go
out
to
briscoe
it
an
hour
before
supper
time
and
you
can
talk
to
young
fisbee
all
you
want
he
out
as
they
drove
along
the
pike
harkless
three
companions
kept
up
a
conversation
sprightly
beyond
the
mere
exhilaration
of
the
victorious
but
john
sat
almost
silent
and
in
spite
of
their
liveliness
the
others
eyed
him
a
little
anxiously
now
and
then
knowing
that
he
had
been
living
on
excitement
through
a
physically
exhausting
day
and
they
were
fearful
lest
his
nerves
react
and
bring
him
to
a
breakdown
but
the
healthy
flush
of
his
cheek
was
reassuring
he
looked
steady
and
strong
and
they
were
pleased
to
believe
that
the
was
what
he
needed
it
had
been
a
strange
and
beautiful
day
to
him
begun
in
anger
but
the
sun
was
not
to
go
down
upon
his
wrath
for
his
choleric
intention
had
almost
vanished
on
his
homeward
way
and
the
first
words
smith
had
spoken
had
lifted
the
veil
of
young
fisbee
duplicity
had
shown
him
with
what
fine
intelligence
and
supreme
delicacy
and
sympathy
young
fisbee
had
worked
for
him
had
understood
him
and
had
him
if
the
open
assault
on
mccune
had
been
pressed
and
the
damnatory
evidence
published
in
harkless
own
paper
while
harkless
himself
was
a
candidate
and
rival
john
would
have
felt
dishonored
the
mccune
papers
could
have
been
used
for
halloway
benefit
but
not
for
his
own
he
would
not
ride
to
success
on
another
man
ruin
and
young
fisbee
had
understood
and
had
saved
him
it
was
a
point
of
honor
that
many
would
have
held
finicky
and
inconsistent
but
one
which
young
fisbee
had
comprehended
was
vital
to
harkless
and
this
was
the
man
he
had
discharged
like
a
dishonest
servant
the
man
who
had
thrown
what
was
in
carlow
eyes
riches
into
his
lap
the
man
who
had
made
his
paper
and
who
had
made
him
and
saved
him
harkless
wanted
to
see
young
fisbee
as
he
longed
to
see
only
one
other
person
in
the
world
two
singular
things
had
happened
that
day
which
made
his
craving
to
see
helen
almost
unbearable
just
to
rest
his
eyes
upon
her
for
a
little
while
he
could
ask
no
more
and
as
they
passed
along
that
road
every
tree
every
leaf
by
the
wayside
it
seemed
spoke
to
him
and
called
upon
the
dear
memory
of
his
two
walks
with
her
into
town
and
out
of
town
on
he
wondered
if
his
heart
was
to
project
a
wraith
of
her
before
him
whenever
he
was
deeply
moved
for
the
rest
of
his
life
for
twice
he
had
seen
her
whom
he
knew
to
be
so
far
away
she
had
gone
back
to
her
friends
in
the
north
tom
had
said
twice
that
afternoon
he
had
been
momentarily
but
vividly
conscious
of
her
as
a
living
presence
as
he
descended
from
the
car
at
the
station
his
eyes
wandering
out
over
the
tumultuous
crowd
had
caught
and
held
a
picture
for
a
second
a
graceful
arm
upraised
and
a
gloved
hand
pressed
against
a
blushing
cheek
under
a
hat
such
as
is
not
worn
in
carlow
a
little
figure
poised
apparently
in
air
above
the
crowd
about
her
so
for
the
merest
flick
of
time
he
had
seen
her
and
then
to
his
straining
eyes
it
was
as
though
she
were
not
she
had
vanished
and
again
as
his
carriage
reached
the
square
a
feeling
had
come
to
him
that
she
was
near
him
that
she
was
looking
at
him
that
he
should
see
her
when
the
carriage
turned
and
in
the
same
instant
above
the
singing
of
a
multitude
he
heard
her
voice
as
if
there
had
been
no
other
and
once
more
his
dazzled
eyes
beheld
her
for
a
second
she
was
singing
and
as
she
sang
she
leaned
toward
him
from
on
high
with
the
most
ineffable
look
of
tenderness
and
pride
and
affection
he
had
ever
seen
on
a
woman
face
such
a
look
he
thought
as
she
would
wear
if
she
came
to
love
some
archangel
her
love
should
be
no
less
with
all
of
her
heart
and
soul
and
strength
and
so
he
knew
he
had
seen
a
vision
but
it
was
a
cruel
one
to
visit
a
man
who
loved
her
he
had
summoned
his
philosophy
and
his
courage
in
his
interview
with
himself
on
the
way
to
carlow
and
they
had
answered
but
nothing
could
answer
if
his
eyes
were
to
play
him
tricks
and
bring
her
visibly
before
him
and
with
such
an
expression
as
he
had
seen
upon
her
face
it
was
too
real
it
made
his
eyes
yearn
for
the
sight
of
her
with
an
ache
that
was
physical
and
even
at
that
moment
he
saw
far
ahead
of
them
on
the
road
two
figures
standing
in
front
of
the
brick
house
one
was
unmistakable
at
any
distance
it
was
that
of
old
fisbee
and
the
other
was
a
girl
a
light
small
figure
without
a
hat
and
the
low
western
sun
dwelt
on
a
head
that
shone
with
gold
harkless
put
his
hand
over
his
eyes
with
a
pain
that
was
like
the
taste
of
hemlock
in
nectar
sun
in
your
eyes
asked
keating
lifting
his
hat
so
as
to
shield
the
other
face
when
he
looked
again
both
figures
were
gone
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
think
of
the
only
other
person
who
could
absorb
his
attention
at
least
for
a
time
very
soon
he
would
stand
face
to
face
with
the
six
feet
of
brawn
and
intelligence
and
manhood
that
was
young
fisbee
you
are
sure
he
is
there
he
asked
tom
martin
yes
answered
martin
with
no
need
to
inquire
whom
the
editor
meant
i
reckon
he
continued
solemnly
peering
at
the
other
from
under
his
rusty
i
reckon
when
you
see
him
maybe
you
want
to
put
a
kind
of
codicil
to
that
deed
to
the
how
that
martin
why
i
guess
maybe
you
well
wait
till
you
see
i
do
want
to
wait
much
longer
when
i
remember
what
i
owe
him
and
how
i
have
used
him
and
that
i
have
been
here
nearly
three
hours
without
seeing
as
they
neared
the
brick
house
harkless
made
out
through
the
trees
a
retreative
flutter
of
skirts
on
the
porch
and
the
thought
crossed
his
mind
that
minnie
had
flown
indoors
to
give
some
final
directions
toward
the
preparation
of
the
banquet
but
when
the
barouche
halted
at
the
gate
he
was
surprised
to
see
her
waving
to
him
from
the
steps
while
tom
meredith
and
bence
and
boswell
formed
a
little
court
around
her
lige
willetts
rode
up
on
horse
back
at
the
same
moment
and
the
judge
was
waiting
in
front
of
the
gate
harkless
stepped
out
of
the
barouche
and
took
his
hand
i
was
told
young
fisbee
was
young
fisbee
is
here
said
the
judge
where
please
briscoe
want
to
see
him
right
off
i
do
very
you
withdraw
his
discharge
i
expect
now
ah
exclaimed
the
other
i
want
to
make
him
a
present
of
the
if
he
take
he
fumed
to
meredith
who
had
come
to
the
gate
tom
where
is
he
meredith
put
his
hand
on
his
friend
shoulder
and
answered
i
know
god
bless
you
old
fellow
the
truth
is
said
the
judge
as
they
entered
the
gate
that
when
you
drove
up
young
fisbee
ran
into
the
house
minnie
he
turned
but
his
daughter
had
disappeared
however
she
came
to
the
door
a
moment
later
and
shook
her
head
mysteriously
at
her
father
not
in
the
house
she
said
fisbee
came
around
the
corner
of
the
porch
and
went
toward
harkless
fisbee
cried
the
latter
where
is
your
nephew
the
old
man
took
his
hand
in
both
his
own
and
looked
him
between
the
eyes
and
thus
stood
while
there
was
a
long
pause
the
others
watching
them
you
must
not
say
that
i
told
you
he
said
at
last
go
into
the
but
when
harkless
step
crunched
the
garden
path
there
was
no
one
there
asters
were
blooming
in
beds
between
the
green
and
their
hands
were
flung
open
in
wide
surprise
that
he
should
expect
to
find
young
fisbee
there
it
was
just
before
sunset
birds
were
gossiping
in
the
sycamores
on
the
bank
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
near
the
creek
there
were
some
tall
hydrangea
bushes
and
beyond
them
one
broad
shaft
of
the
sun
smote
the
creek
bends
for
a
mile
in
that
flat
land
and
crossed
the
garden
like
a
bright
veil
harkless
passed
the
bushes
and
stepped
out
into
this
gold
brilliance
then
he
uttered
a
cry
and
stopped
helen
was
standing
beside
the
hydrangeas
with
both
hands
against
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
she
had
run
away
as
far
as
she
could
run
there
were
high
fences
extending
down
to
the
creek
on
each
side
and
the
water
was
beyond
he
said
she
did
not
lift
her
eyes
but
began
to
move
away
from
him
with
little
backward
steps
when
she
reached
the
bench
on
the
bank
she
spoke
with
a
quick
intake
of
breath
and
in
a
voice
he
scarcely
heard
it
was
the
merest
whisper
and
her
words
came
so
slowly
that
sometimes
minutes
separated
them
can
you
will
you
keep
me
on
the
keep
you
will
you
let
me
help
he
came
near
her
i
do
understand
is
it
you
you
who
are
here
again
have
you
forgiven
me
you
know
now
why
i
would
resign
you
forgive
my
that
telegram
what
telegram
that
one
that
came
to
you
this
telegram
did
you
send
me
one
it
did
not
come
to
yes
it
but
there
what
was
it
about
it
was
signed
she
said
it
was
signed
she
paused
and
turned
half
way
not
lifting
the
downcast
lashes
her
hand
laid
upon
the
arm
of
the
bench
was
shaking
she
put
it
behind
her
then
her
eyes
were
lifted
a
little
and
though
they
did
not
meet
his
he
saw
them
and
a
strange
frightened
glory
leaped
in
his
heart
her
voice
fell
still
lower
and
two
heavy
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
it
was
signed
she
whispered
it
was
signed
fisbee
he
began
to
tremble
from
head
to
foot
there
was
a
long
silence
she
had
turned
quite
away
from
him
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
as
low
as
hers
and
he
spoke
as
slowly
as
she
had
you
mean
then
it
was
you
you
and
you
have
been
here
all
the
time
all
all
except
the
week
you
were
hurt
and
that
that
one
the
bright
veil
which
wrapped
them
was
drawn
away
and
they
stood
in
the
silent
gathering
dusk
he
tried
to
loosen
his
it
seemed
to
be
choking
him
i
i
ca
i
do
comprehend
it
i
am
trying
to
realize
what
it
it
means
nothing
she
answered
there
was
an
editorial
yesterday
he
said
an
editorial
that
i
thought
was
about
rodney
mccune
did
you
write
it
it
was
about
me
was
it
it
said
it
said
that
i
had
won
the
love
of
every
person
in
carlow
suddenly
she
found
her
voice
do
not
misunderstand
me
she
said
rapidly
i
have
done
the
little
that
i
have
done
out
of
she
faced
him
now
but
without
meeting
his
eyes
i
told
you
remember
that
you
would
understand
some
day
what
i
meant
by
that
and
the
day
has
come
i
owed
you
more
gratitude
than
a
woman
ever
owed
a
man
before
i
think
and
i
would
have
died
to
pay
a
part
of
it
i
set
every
tongue
in
rouen
clacking
at
the
very
start
in
the
merest
amateurish
preparation
for
the
work
macauley
gave
me
that
was
nothing
and
the
rest
has
been
the
happiest
time
in
my
life
i
have
only
pleased
myself
after
all
what
gratitude
did
you
owe
me
what
gratitude
for
what
you
did
for
my
i
have
only
seen
your
father
once
in
my
life
at
your
table
at
the
dance
supper
that
listen
my
father
is
a
gentle
old
man
with
white
hair
and
kind
eyes
you
saw
my
uncle
that
night
he
has
been
as
good
to
me
as
a
father
since
i
was
seven
years
old
and
he
gave
me
his
name
by
law
and
i
lived
with
him
my
father
came
to
see
me
once
a
year
i
never
came
to
see
him
he
always
told
me
everything
was
well
with
him
that
his
life
was
happy
once
he
lost
the
little
he
had
left
to
him
in
the
world
his
only
way
of
making
his
living
he
had
no
friends
he
was
hungry
and
desperate
and
he
wandered
i
was
dancing
and
going
about
wearing
jewels
only
i
did
not
know
all
the
time
the
brave
heart
wrote
me
happy
letters
i
should
have
known
for
there
was
one
who
did
and
who
saved
him
when
at
last
i
came
to
see
my
father
he
told
me
he
had
written
of
his
idol
before
but
it
was
not
till
i
came
that
he
told
it
all
to
me
do
you
know
what
i
felt
while
his
daughter
was
dancing
cotillions
a
stranger
had
taken
his
hand
and
a
sob
rose
in
her
throat
and
checked
her
utterance
for
a
moment
but
she
threw
up
her
head
and
met
his
eyes
proudly
gratitude
harkless
she
cried
i
am
james
fisbee
he
fell
back
from
the
bench
with
a
sharp
exclamation
and
stared
at
her
through
the
gray
twilight
she
went
on
hurriedly
again
not
looking
at
him
when
you
showed
me
that
you
cared
for
me
when
you
told
me
that
you
did
i
do
you
think
i
wanted
to
care
for
you
i
wanted
to
do
something
to
show
you
that
i
could
be
ashamed
of
my
vile
neglect
of
him
something
to
show
you
his
daughter
could
be
grateful
if
i
had
loved
you
what
i
did
would
have
been
for
that
and
i
could
not
have
done
it
and
how
could
i
have
shown
my
gratitude
if
i
had
done
it
for
love
and
it
has
been
such
dear
happy
work
the
little
i
have
done
that
it
seems
after
all
that
i
have
done
it
for
love
of
myself
but
but
when
you
first
told
me
she
broke
off
with
a
strange
fluttering
half
inarticulate
little
laugh
that
was
half
tears
and
then
resumed
in
another
tone
when
you
told
me
you
cared
that
night
that
night
we
were
here
how
could
i
be
sure
it
had
been
only
two
days
you
see
and
even
if
i
could
have
been
sure
of
myself
why
i
could
have
told
you
oh
i
had
so
brazenly
thrown
myself
at
your
head
time
and
again
those
two
days
in
my
my
worship
of
your
goodness
to
my
father
and
my
excitement
in
recognizing
in
his
friend
the
hero
of
my
girlhood
that
you
had
every
right
to
think
i
cared
but
if
but
if
i
had
if
i
had
loved
you
with
my
whole
soul
i
could
not
have
why
no
woman
could
have
i
mean
the
sort
of
girl
i
am
could
have
admitted
it
must
have
denied
it
and
what
i
was
trying
to
do
for
you
when
we
met
in
rouen
was
was
courting
you
you
surely
see
i
could
have
done
it
if
i
had
cared
it
would
have
been
brazen
and
do
you
think
that
then
i
could
have
answered
even
if
i
wanted
to
even
if
i
had
been
sure
of
myself
and
now
her
voice
sank
again
to
a
whisper
and
now
from
the
meadows
across
the
creek
and
over
the
fields
came
a
far
tinkling
of
three
months
ago
at
this
hour
john
harkless
had
listened
to
that
sound
and
its
great
lonesomeness
had
touched
his
heart
like
a
cold
hand
but
now
as
the
mists
were
rising
from
the
water
and
the
small
stars
pierced
the
sky
one
by
one
glinting
down
through
the
dim
immeasurable
blue
distances
he
found
no
loneliness
in
heaven
or
earth
he
leaned
forward
toward
her
the
bench
was
between
them
the
last
light
was
gone
evening
had
fallen
and
now
he
said
she
moved
backward
as
he
leaned
nearer
you
promised
to
remember
on
the
day
you
understood
she
answered
a
little
huskily
that
it
was
all
from
the
purest
and
and
there
is
nothing
else
if
there
were
she
said
and
her
voice
grew
more
and
more
unsteady
if
there
were
ca
you
see
that
what
i
have
done
she
stopped
and
then
suddenly
ah
it
would
have
been
he
looked
up
at
the
little
stars
and
he
heard
the
bells
and
they
struck
into
his
heart
like
a
dirge
he
made
a
singular
gesture
of
abnegation
and
then
dropped
upon
the
bench
with
his
head
bowed
between
his
hands
she
pressed
her
hand
to
her
bosom
watching
him
in
a
startled
fashion
her
eyes
wide
and
her
lips
parted
she
took
a
few
quick
short
steps
toward
the
garden
still
watching
him
over
her
shoulder
you
must
worry
he
said
not
lifting
his
bent
head
i
know
sorry
i
be
all
right
in
a
she
gave
a
hurried
glance
from
right
to
left
and
from
left
to
right
like
one
in
terror
seeking
a
way
of
escape
she
gathered
her
skirts
in
her
hand
as
if
to
run
into
the
garden
but
suddenly
she
turned
and
ran
to
him
ran
to
him
swiftly
with
her
great
love
shining
from
her
eyes
she
sank
upon
her
knees
beside
him
she
threw
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
oh
my
dear
do
you
see
she
whispered
do
you
see
do
you
see
when
they
heard
the
judge
calling
from
the
orchard
they
went
back
through
the
garden
toward
the
house
it
was
dark
the
whitest
asters
were
but
gray
splotches
there
was
no
one
in
the
orchard
briscoe
had
gone
indoors
did
you
know
you
are
to
drive
me
into
town
in
the
phaeton
for
the
fireworks
she
asked
fireworks
yes
the
great
harkless
has
come
even
in
the
darkness
he
could
see
the
look
the
vision
had
given
him
when
the
barouche
turned
into
the
square
she
smiled
upon
him
and
said
all
afternoon
i
was
wishing
i
could
have
been
your
he
clasped
her
hand
more
tightly
this
wonderful
world
he
cried
yesterday

had
a
doctor
a
doctor
to
cure
me
of
they
went
on
a
little
way
we
must
hurry
she
said
i
am
sure
they
have
been
waiting
for
this
was
true
they
had
from
the
came
laughter
and
hearty
voices
and
the
windows
were
bright
with
the
light
of
many
lamps
by
and
by
they
stood
just
outside
the
patch
of
light
that
fell
from
one
of
the
windows
look

they

dear
people

he
answered
