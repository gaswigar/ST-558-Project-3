conclusion
the
fulfilment
of
my
prediction
was
now
at
hand
for
the
result
of
the
battle
of
waterloo
enabled
louis
xviii
to
return
to
his
dominions
as
soon
as
i
heard
of
the
king
departure
from
ghent
i
quitted
hamburg
and
travelled
with
all
possible
haste
in
the
hope
of
reaching
paris
in
time
to
witness
his
majesty
entrance
i
arrived
at
denis
on
the
of
july
and
notwithstanding
the
intrigues
that
were
set
on
foot
i
found
an
immense
number
of
persons
assembled
to
meet
the
king
indeed
the
place
was
so
crowded
that
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
i
could
procure
even
a
little
garret
for
my
lodging
having
resumed
my
uniform
of
a
captain
of
the
national
guard
i
proceeded
immediately
to
the
king
palace
the
salon
was
filled
with
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
had
come
to
congratulate
the
king
on
his
return
at
denis
i
found
my
family
who
not
being
aware
that
i
had
left
hamburg
were
much
surprised
to
see
me
they
informed
me
that
the
parisians
were
all
impatient
for
the
return
of
the
king
a
fact
of
which
i
could
judge
by
the
opposition
manifested
to
the
free
expression
of
public
feeling
paris
having
been
declared
in
a
state
of
blockade
the
gates
were
closed
and
no
one
was
permitted
to
leave
the
capital
particularly
by
the
barriere
de
la
chapelle
it
is
true
that
special
permission
might
be
obtained
and
with
tolerable
ease
by
those
who
wished
to
leave
the
city
but
the
forms
to
be
observed
for
obtaining
the
permission
deterred
the
mass
of
the
people
from
proceeding
to
denis
which
indeed
was
the
sole
object
of
the
regulation
as
it
had
been
resolved
to
force
fouche
and
the
cockade
upon
the
king
it
was
deemed
necessary
to
keep
away
from
his
majesty
all
who
might
persuade
him
to
resist
the
proposed
measures
madame
de
bourrienne
told
me
that
on
her
arrival
at
denis
she
called
upon
hue
and
lefebvre
the
king
physician
who
both
acquainted
her
with
those
fatal
resolutions
those
gentlemen
however
assured
her
that
the
king
would
resolutely
hold
out
against
the
cockade
but
the
nomination
of
the
man
appeared
inevitable
fouche
minister
of
the
police
if
like
don
juan
i
had
seen
a
statue
move
i
could
not
have
been
more
confounded
than
when
i
heard
this
news
i
could
not
credit
it
until
it
was
repeated
to
me
by
different
persons
how
indeed
could
i
think
that
at
the
moment
of
a
reaction
the
king
should
have
entrusted
the
most
important
ministerial
department
to
a
man
to
whose
arrest
he
had
a
hundred
days
before
attached
so
much
consequence
to
a
man
moreover
whom
bonaparte
had
appointed
at
lyons
to
fill
the
same
office
this
was
inconceivable
thus
in
less
than
hours
the
same
man
had
been
entrusted
to
execute
measures
the
most
opposite
and
to
serve
interests
the
most
contradictory
he
was
one
day
the
minister
of
usurpation
and
the
next
the
minister
of
legitimacy
how
can
i
express
what
i
felt
when
fouche
took
the
oath
of
fidelity
to
louis
xviii
when
i
saw
the
king
clasp
in
his
hands
the
hands
of
fouche
i
was
standing
near
de
chateaubriand
whose
feelings
must
have
been
similar
to
mine
to
judge
from
a
passage
in
his
admirable
work
monarchie
selon
la
charte
about
nine
in
the
evening
he
says
i
was
in
one
of
the
royal
antechambers
all
at
once
the
door
opened
and
i
saw
the
president
of
the
council
enter
leaning
on
the
arm
of
the
new
minister
oh
oh
my
unfortunate
master
you
have
proved
that
there
is
no
sacrifice
which
your
people
may
not
expect
from
your
paternal
heart
fouche
was
resolved
to
have
his
restoration
as
well
as
de
talleyrand
who
had
had
his
the
year
before
he
therefore
contrived
to
retard
the
king
entry
into
paris
for
four
days
the
prudent
members
of
the
chamber
of
peers
who
had
taken
no
part
in
the
king
government
in
were
the
first
to
declare
that
it
was
for
the
interest
of
france
to
hasten
his
majesty
entrance
into
paris
in
order
to
prevent
foreigners
from
exercising
a
sort
of
right
of
conquest
in
a
city
which
was
a
prey
to
civil
dissension
and
party
influence
blucher
informed
me
that
the
way
in
which
fouche
contrived
to
delay
the
king
return
greatly
contributed
to
the
pretensions
of
the
foreigners
who
he
confessed
were
very
well
pleased
to
see
the
population
of
paris
divided
in
opinion
and
to
hear
the
alarming
cries
raised
by
the
confederates
of
the
faubourgs
when
the
king
was
already
at
denis
i
know
for
a
fact
that
louis
xviii
wished
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
fouche
and
indignantly
refused
to
appoint
him
when
he
was
first
proposed
but
he
had
so
nobly
served
bonaparte
during
the
hundred
days
that
it
was
necessary
he
should
be
rewarded
fouche
besides
had
gained
the
support
of
a
powerful
party
among
the
emigrants
of
the
faubourg
germain
and
he
possessed
the
art
of
rendering
himself
indispensable
i
have
heard
many
honest
men
say
very
seriously
that
to
him
was
due
the
tranquillity
of
paris
moreover
wellington
was
the
person
by
whose
influence
in
particular
fouche
was
made
one
of
the
counsellors
of
the
king
after
all
the
benefits
which
foreigners
had
conferred
upon
us
fouche
was
indeed
an
acceptable
present
to
france
and
to
the
king
i
was
not
ignorant
of
the
duke
of
wellington
influence
upon
the
affairs
of
the
second
restoration
but
for
a
long
time
i
refused
to
believe
that
his
influence
should
have
outweighed
all
the
serious
considerations
opposed
to
such
a
perfect
anomaly
as
appointing
fouche
the
minister
of
a
bourbon
but
i
was
deceived
france
and
the
king
owed
to
him
introduction
into
the
council
and
i
had
to
thank
him
for
the
impossibility
of
resuming
a
situation
which
i
had
relinquished
for
the
purpose
of
following
the
king
into
belgium
could
i
be
prefect
of
police
under
a
minister
whom
a
short
time
before
i
had
received
orders
to
arrest
but
who
eluded
my
agents
that
was
impossible
the
king
could
not
offer
me
the
place
of
prefect
under
fouche
and
if
he
had
i
could
not
have
accepted
it
i
was
therefore
right
in
not
relying
on
the
assurances
which
had
been
given
me
but
i
confess
that
if
i
had
been
told
to
guess
the
cause
why
they
could
not
be
realised
i
never
should
have
thought
that
cause
would
have
been
the
appointment
of
fouche
as
a
minister
of
the
king
of
france
at
first
therefore
i
was
of
course
quite
forgotten
as
is
the
custom
of
courts
when
a
faithful
subject
refrains
from
taking
part
in
the
intrigues
of
the
moment
i
have
already
frequently
stated
my
opinion
of
the
pretended
talent
of
fouche
but
admitting
his
talent
to
have
been
as
great
as
was
supposed
that
would
have
been
an
additional
reason
for
not
entrusting
the
general
police
of
the
kingdom
to
him
his
principles
and
conduct
were
already
sufficiently
known
no
one
could
be
ignorant
of
the
language
he
held
respecting
the
bourbons
and
in
which
be
indulged
as
freely
after
he
became
the
minister
of
louis
xviii
as
when
he
was
the
minister
of
bonaparte
it
was
universally
known
that
in
his
conversation
the
bourbons
were
the
perpetual
butt
for
his
sarcasms
that
he
never
mentioned
them
but
in
terms
of
disparagement
and
that
he
represented
them
as
unworthy
of
governing
france
everybody
must
have
been
aware
that
fouche
in
his
heart
favoured
a
republic
where
the
part
of
president
might
have
been
assigned
to
him
could
any
one
have
forgotten
the
famous
postscript
he
subjoined
to
a
letter
he
wrote
from
lyons
to
his
worthy
friend
robespierre
to
celebrate
the
fete
of
the
republic
suitably
i
have
ordered
persons
to
be
shot
and
to
this
man
the
most
furious
enemy
of
the
restoration
of
the
monarchy
was
consigned
the
task
of
consolidating
it
for
the
second
time
but
it
would
require
another
claudian
to
describe
this
new
rufinus
fouche
never
regarded
a
benefit
in
any
other
light
than
as
the
means
of
injuring
his
benefactor
the
king
deceived
like
many
other
persons
by
the
reputation
which
fouche
partisans
had
conjured
up
for
him
was
certainly
not
aware
that
fouche
had
always
discharged
the
functions
of
minister
in
his
own
interest
and
never
for
the
interest
of
the
government
which
had
the
weakness
to
entrust
him
with
a
power
always
dangerous
in
his
hands
fouche
had
opinions
but
he
belonged
to
no
party
and
his
political
success
is
explained
by
the
readiness
with
which
he
always
served
the
party
he
knew
must
triumph
and
which
he
himself
overthrew
in
its
turn
he
maintained
himself
in
favour
from
the
days
of
blood
and
terror
until
the
happy
time
of
the
second
restoration
only
by
abandoning
and
sacrificing
those
who
were
attached
to
him
and
it
might
be
said
that
his
ruling
passion
was
the
desire
of
continual
change
no
man
was
ever
characterised
by
greater
levity
or
inconstancy
of
mind
in
all
things
he
looked
only
to
himself
and
to
this
egotism
he
sacrificed
both
subjects
and
governments
such
were
the
secret
causes
of
the
sway
exercised
by
fouche
during
the
convention
the
directory
the
empire
the
usurpation
and
after
the
second
return
of
the
bourbons
he
helped
to
found
and
to
destroy
every
one
of
those
successive
governments
character
is
perfectly
unique
i
know
no
other
man
who
loaded
with
honours
and
almost
escaping
disgrace
has
passed
through
so
many
eventful
periods
and
taken
part
in
so
many
convulsions
and
revolutions
on
the
of
july
the
king
was
told
that
fouche
alone
could
smooth
the
way
for
his
entrance
into
paris
that
he
alone
could
unlock
the
gates
of
the
capital
and
that
he
alone
had
power
to
control
public
opinion
the
reception
given
to
the
king
on
the
following
day
afforded
an
opportunity
of
judging
of
the
truth
of
these
assertions
the
king
presence
was
the
signal
for
a
feeling
of
concord
which
was
manifested
in
a
very
decided
way
i
saw
upon
the
boulevards
and
often
in
company
with
each
other
persons
some
of
whom
had
resumed
the
white
cockade
while
others
still
retained
the
national
colours
and
harmony
was
not
in
the
least
disturbed
by
these
different
badges
having
returned
to
private
life
solely
on
account
of
fouche
presence
in
the
ministry
i
yielded
to
that
consolation
which
is
always
left
to
the
discontented
i
watched
the
extravagance
and
inconsistency
that
were
passing
around
me
and
the
new
follies
which
were
every
day
committed
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
a
rich
and
varied
picture
presented
itself
to
my
observation
the
king
did
not
bring
back
de
blacas
his
majesty
had
yielded
to
prudent
advice
and
on
arriving
at
mons
sent
the
unlucky
minister
as
his
ambassador
to
naples
vengeance
was
talked
of
and
there
were
some
persons
inconsiderate
enough
to
wish
that
advantage
should
be
taken
of
the
presence
of
the
foreigners
in
order
to
make
what
they
termed
an
end
of
the
revolution
as
if
there
were
any
other
means
of
effecting
that
object
than
frankly
adopting
whatever
good
the
revolution
had
produced
the
foreigners
observed
with
satisfaction
the
disposition
of
these
shallow
persons
which
they
thought
might
be
turned
to
their
own
advantage
the
truth
is
that
on
the
second
restoration
our
pretended
allies
proved
themselves
our
enemies
but
for
them
but
for
their
bad
conduct
their
insatiable
exactions
but
for
the
humiliation
that
was
felt
at
seeing
foreign
cannon
planted
in
the
streets
of
paris
and
beneath
the
very
windows
of
the
palace
the
days
which
followed
the
of
july
might
have
been
considered
by
the
royal
family
as
the
season
of
a
festival
every
day
people
thronged
to
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
and
expressed
their
joy
by
singing
and
dancing
under
the
king
windows
this
ebullition
of
feeling
might
perhaps
be
thought
absurd
but
it
at
least
bore
evidence
of
the
pleasure
caused
by
the
return
of
the
bourbons
this
manifestation
of
joy
by
numbers
of
persons
of
both
sexes
most
of
them
belonging
to
the
better
classes
of
society
displeased
fouche
and
he
determined
to
put
a
stop
to
it
wretches
were
hired
to
mingle
with
the
crowd
and
sprinkle
corrosive
liquids
on
the
dresses
of
the
females
some
of
them
were
even
instructed
to
commit
acts
of
indecency
so
that
all
respectable
persons
were
driven
from
the
gardens
through
the
fear
of
being
injured
or
insulted
as
it
was
wished
to
create
disturbance
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
king
and
to
make
him
doubt
the
reality
of
the
sentiments
so
openly
expressed
in
his
favour
the
agents
of
the
police
mingled
the
cry
of
vive
with
that
of
vive
le
roi
and
it
happened
oftener
than
once
that
the
most
respectable
persons
were
arrested
and
charged
by
fouche
infamous
agents
with
having
uttered
seditious
cries
a
friend
of
mine
whose
royalist
opinions
were
well
known
and
whose
father
had
been
massacred
during
the
revolution
told
me
that
while
walking
with
two
ladies
he
heard
some
individuals
near
him
crying
out
vive
this
created
a
great
disturbance
the
sentinel
advanced
to
the
spot
and
those
very
individuals
themselves
had
the
audacity
to
charge
my
friend
with
being
guilty
of
uttering
the
offensive
cry
in
vain
the
bystanders
asserted
the
falsehood
of
the
accusation
he
was
seized
and
dragged
to
the
and
after
being
detained
for
some
hours
he
was
liberated
on
the
application
of
his
friends
by
dint
of
such
wretched
manoeuvres
fouche
triumphed
he
contrived
to
make
it
be
believed
that
he
was
the
only
person
capable
of
preventing
the
disorders
of
which
he
himself
was
the
sole
author
he
got
the
police
of
the
tuileries
under
his
control
the
singing
and
dancing
ceased
and
the
palace
was
the
abode
of
dulness
while
the
king
was
at
denis
he
restored
to
general
dessoles
the
command
of
the
national
guard
the
general
ordered
the
barriers
to
be
immediately
thrown
open
on
the
day
of
his
arrival
in
paris
the
king
determined
as
a
principle
that
the
throne
should
be
surrounded
by
a
privy
council
the
members
of
which
were
to
be
the
princes
and
persons
whom
his
majesty
might
appoint
at
a
future
period
the
king
then
named
his
new
ministry
which
was
thus
composed
prince
talleyrand
peer
of
france
president
of
the
council

but
what
was
most
gratifying
to
the
public
in
the
composition
of
this
new

was
that
de
blacas
who
had
made
himself
so
odious
to
everybody
was
superseded
by
de

whose
name
revived
the
memory
of
a
great
minister
and
who
by
his
excellent
conduct
throughout
the
whole
course
of
his

deserves
to
be
distinguished
as
a
model
of
honour
and

general
satisfaction
was
expressed
on

appointment
of

of

of

in

of

which
during

hundred
days
had
been

made
of

and

i
was

in

of

by
decazes
and
beugnot
followed
ferrand
as
of
the
i
think
it
was
on
the
of
july
that
i
went
to
st
cloud
to
pay
a
visit
of
thanks
to
blucher
i
had
been
informed
that
as
soon
as
he
learned
i
had
a
house
at
st
cloud
he
sent
a
guard
to
protect
it
this
spontaneous
mark
of
attention
was
well
deserving
of
grateful
acknowledgment
especially
at
a
time
when
there
was
so
much
reason
to
complain
of
the
plunder
practised
by
the
prussians
my
visit
to
blucher
presented
to
observation
a
striking
instance
of
the
instability
of
human
greatness
i
found
blucher
residing
like
a
sovereign
in
the
palace
of
st
cloud
where
i
had
lived
so
long
in
the
intimacy
of
napoleon
at
a
period
when
he
dictated
laws
to
the
kings
of
europe
before
he
was
a
monarch
himself
the
english
occupied
st
cloud
after
the
prussians
my
large
house
in
which
the
children
of
the
comte
were
inoculated
was
respected
by
them
but
they
occupied
a
small
home
forming
part
of
the
estate
the
english
officer
who
commanded
the
troops
stationed
a
guard
at
the
large
house
one
morning
we
were
informed
that
the
door
had
been
broken
open
and
a
valuable
stolen
we
complained
to
the
commanding
officer
and
on
the
affair
being
inquired
into
it
was
discovered
that
the
sentinel
himself
had
committed
the
theft
the
man
was
tried
by
a
and
condemned
to
death
a
circumstance
which
as
may
naturally
be
supposed
was
very
distressing
to
us
madame
de
bourrienne
applied
to
the
commanding
officer
for
the
man
pardon
but
could
only
obtain
his
reprieve
the
regiment
departed
some
weeks
after
and
we
could
never
learn
what
was
the
fate
of
the
bourrienne
in
that
cabinet
in
which
napoleon
and
i
had
passed
so
many
busy
hours
and
where
so
many
great
plans
had
their
birth
i
was
received
by
the
man
who
had
been
my
prisoner
at
hamburg
the
prussian
general
immediately
reminded
me
of
the
circumstance
who
could
have
foreseen
said
he
that
after
being
your
prisoner
i
should
become
the
protector
of
your
property
you
treated
me
well
at
hamburg
and
i
have
now
an
opportunity
of
repaying
your
kindness
heaven
knows
what
will
be
the
result
of
all
this
one
thing
however
is
certain
and
that
is
that
the
allies
will
now
make
such
conditions
as
will
banish
all
possibility
of
danger
for
a
long
time
to
come
the
emperor
alexander
does
not
wish
to
make
the
french
people
expiate
too
dearly
the
misfortunes
they
have
caused
us
he
attributes
them
to
napoleon
but
napoleon
can
not
pay
the
expenses
of
the
war
and
they
must
be
paid
by
some
one
it
was
all
very
well
for
once
but
we
can
not
pay
the
expense
of
coming
back
a
second
time
however
added
he
you
will
lose
none
of
your
territory
that
is
a
point
on
which
i
can
give
you
positive
assurance
the
emperor
alexander
has
several
times
repeated
in
my
presence
to
the
king
my
master
honour
the
french
nation
and
i
am
determined
that
it
shall
preserve
its
old
limits
the
above
are
the
very
words
which
blucher
addressed
to
me
profiting
by
the
friendly
sentiments
he
expressed
towards
me
i
took
the
opportunity
of
mentioning
the
complaints
that
were
everywhere
made
of
the
bad
discipline
of
the
troops
under
his
command
what
can
i
do
said
he
i
can
not
be
present
everywhere
but
i
assure
you
that
in
future
and
at
your
recommendation
i
will
severely
punish
any
misconduct
that
may
come
to
my
knowledge
such
was
the
result
of
my
visit
to
blucher
but
in
spite
of
his
promises
his
troops
continued
to
commit
the
most
revolting
excesses
thus
the
prussian
troops
have
left
in
the
neighbourhood
of
paris
recollections
no
less
odious
than
those
produced
by
the
conduct
of
davoust
corps
in
of
this
an
instance
now
occurs
to
my
memory
which
i
will
relate
here
in
the
spring
of
as
i
was
going
to
chevreuse
i
stopped
at
the
petit
bicetre
to
water
my
horse
i
seated
myself
for
a
few
minutes
near
the
door
of
the
inn
and
a
large
dog
belonging
to
the
innkeeper
began
to
bark
and
growl
at
me
his
master
a
old
man
exclaimed
be
quiet
blucher
how
came
you
to
give
your
dog
that
name
said
ah
sir
it
is
the
name
of
a
villain
who
did
a
great
deal
of
mischief
here
last
year
there
is
my
house
they
have
left
scarcely
anything
but
the
four
walls
they
said
they
came
for
our
good
but
let
them
come
back
again
we
will
watch
them
and
spear
them
like
wild
boars
in
the
wood
the
poor
house
certainly
exhibited
traces
of
the
most
atrocious
violence
and
he
shed
tears
as
he
related
to
me
his
disasters
before
the
king
departed
for
ghent
he
had
consented
to
sign
the
contract
of
marriage
between
one
of
my
daughters
and
massieu
de
clerval
though
the
latter
was
at
that
time
only
a
lieutenant
in
the
navy
the
day
appointed
for
the
signature
of
the
contract
happened
to
be
sunday
the
of
march
and
it
may
well
be
imagined
that
in
the
critical
circumstances
in
which
we
then
stood
a
matter
of
so
little
importance
could
scarcely
be
thought
about
in
july
i
renewed
my
request
to
his
majesty
which
gave
rise
to
serious
discussions
in
the
council
of
ceremonies
lest
any
deviation
from
the
laws
of
rigid
etiquette
should
commit
the
fate
of
the
monarchy
it
was
determined
that
the
marriage
contract
of
a
lieutenant
in
the
navy
could
be
signed
only
at
the
petty
levee
however
his
majesty
recollecting
the
promise
he
had
given
me
decided
that
the
signature
should
be
given
at
the
grand
levee
though
all
this
may
appear
exceedingly
ludicrous
yet
i
must
confess
that
the
triumph
over
etiquette
was
very
gratifying
to
me
a
short
time
after
the
king
appointed
me
a
councillor
of
state
a
title
which
i
had
held
under
bonaparte
ever
since
his
installation
at
the
tuileries
though
i
had
never
fulfilled
the
functions
of
the
office
in
the
month
of
august
the
king
having
resolved
to
convoke
a
new
chamber
of
deputies
i
was
appointed
president
of
the
electoral
college
of
the
department
of
the
yonne
as
soon
as
i
was
informed
of
my
nomination
i
waited
on
de
talleyrand
for
my
instructions
but
he
told
me
that
in
conformity
with
the
king
intentions
i
was
to
receive
my
orders
from
the
minister
of
police
i
observed
to
de
talleyrand
that
i
must
decline
seeing
fouche
on
account
of
the
situation
in
which
we
stood
with
reference
to
each
other
go
to
him
go
to
him
said
de
talleyrand
and
be
assured
fouche
will
say
to
you
nothing
on
the
subject
i
felt
great
repugnance
to
see
fouche
and
consequently
i
went
to
him
quite
against
my
inclination
i
naturally
expected
a
very
cold
reception
what
had
passed
between
us
rendered
our
interview
exceedingly
delicate
i
called
on
fouche
at
nine
in
the
morning
and
found
him
alone
and
walking
in
his
garden
he
received
me
as
a
man
might
be
expected
to
receive
an
intimate
friend
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
a
long
time
on
reflection
i
was
not
very
much
surprised
at
this
for
i
was
well
aware
that
fouche
could
make
his
hatred
yield
to
calculation
he
said
not
a
word
about
his
arrest
and
it
may
well
be
supposed
that
i
did
not
seek
to
turn
the
conversation
on
that
subject
i
asked
him
whether
he
had
any
information
to
give
me
respecting
the
elections
of
the
yonne
none
at
all
said
he
get
yourself
nominated
if
you
can
only
use
your
endeavours
to
exclude
general
desfouinaux
anything
else
is
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
what
is
your
objection
to
desfournaux
the
ministry
will
not
have
him
i
was
about
to
depart
when
fouche
called
me
back
saying
why
are
you
in
such
haste
can
not
you
stay
a
few
minutes
longer
he
then
began
to
speak
of
the
first
return
of
the
bourbons
and
asked
me
how
i
could
so
easily
bring
myself
to
act
in
their
favour
he
then
entered
into
details
respecting
the
royal
family
which
i
conceive
it
to
be
my
duty
to
pass
over
in
silence
it
may
be
added
however
that
the
conversation
lasted
a
long
time
and
to
say
the
least
of
it
was
by
no
means
in
favour
of
divine
right
i
conceived
it
to
be
my
duty
to
make
the
king
acquainted
with
this
conversation
and
as
there
was
now
no
comte
de
blacas
to
keep
truth
and
good
advice
from
his
majesty
ear
i
was
on
my
first
solicitation
immediately
admitted
to
the
royal
cabinet
i
cautiously
suppressed
the
most
startling
details
for
had
i
literally
reported
what
fouche
said
louis
xviii
could
not
possibly
have
given
credit
to
it
the
king
thanked
me
for
my
communication
and
i
could
perceive
he
was
convinced
that
by
longer
retaining
fouche
in
office
he
would
become
the
victim
of
the
minister
who
had
been
so
scandalously
forced
upon
him
on
the
of
july
the
disgrace
of
the
duke
of
otranto
speedily
followed
and
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
having
contributed
to
repair
one
of
the
evils
with
which
the
duke
of
wellington
visited
france
fouche
was
so
evidently
a
traitor
to
the
cause
he
feigned
to
serve
and
bonaparte
was
so
convinced
of
this
that
during
the
hundred
days
when
the
ministers
of
the
king
at
ghent
were
enumerated
in
the
presence
of
napoleon
some
one
said
but
where
is
the
minister
of
the
police
parbleu
said
bonaparte
that
is
fouche
it
was
not
the
same
with
carnot
in
spite
of
the
indelible
stain
of
his
vote
if
he
had
served
the
king
his
majesty
could
have
depended
on
him
but
nothing
could
shake
the
firmness
of
his
principles
in
favour
of
liberty
i
learned
from
a
person
who
had
the
opportunity
of
being
well
informed
that
he
would
not
accept
the
post
of
minister
of
the
interior
which
was
offered
to
him
at
the
commencement
of
the
hundred
days
until
he
had
a
conversation
with
bonaparte
to
ascertain
whether
he
had
changed
his
principles
carnot
placed
faith
in
the
fair
promises
of
napoleon
who
deceived
him
as
he
had
deceived
others
soon
after
my
audience
with
the
king
i
set
off
to
discharge
my
duties
in
the
department
of
the
yonne
and
i
obtained
the
honour
of
being
elected
to
represent
my
countrymen
in
the
chamber
of
deputies
my
colleague
was
raudot
a
man
who
in
very
trying
circumstances
had
given
proofs
of
courage
by
boldly
manifesting
his
attachment
to
the
king
government
the
following
are
the
facts
which
i
learned
in
connection
with
this
episode
and
which
i
circulated
as
speedily
as
possible
among
the
electors
of
whom
i
had
the
honour
to
be
president
bonaparte
on
his
way
from
lyons
to
paris
after
his
landing
at
the
gulf
of
juan
stopped
at
avalon
and
immediately
sent
for
the
mayor
raudot
he
instantly
obeyed
the
summons
on
coming
into
napoleon
presence
he
said
what
do
you
want
general
this
appellation
displeased
napoleon
who
nevertheless
put
several
questions
to
raudot
who
was
willing
to
oblige
him
as
a
traveller
but
not
to
serve
him
as
an
emperor
napoleon
having
given
him
some
orders
this
worthy
servant
of
the
king
replied
general
i
can
receive
no
orders
from
you
for
i
acknowledge
no
sovereign
but
the
king
to
whom
i
have
sworn
allegiance
napoleon
then
directed
raudot
in
a
tone
of
severity
to
withdraw
and
i
need
not
add
that
it
was
not
long
before
he
was
dismissed
from
the
mayoralty
of
avalon
the
elections
of
the
yonne
being
over
i
returned
to
paris
where
i
took
part
in
public
affairs
only
as
an
amateur
while
waiting
for
the
opening
of
the
session
i
was
deeply
grieved
to
see
the
government
resort
to
measures
of
severity
to
punish
faults
which
it
would
have
been
better
policy
to
attribute
only
to
the
unfortunate
circumstances
of
the
times
no
consideration
can
ever
make
me
cease
to
regret
the
memory
of
ney
who
was
the
victim
of
the
influence
of
foreigners
their
object
as
blucher
intimated
to
me
at
st
cloud
was
to
disable
france
from
engaging
in
war
for
a
long
time
to
come
and
they
hoped
to
effect
that
object
by
stirring
up
between
the
royal
government
and
the
army
of
the
loire
that
spirit
of
discord
which
the
sacrifice
of
ney
could
not
fail
to
produce
i
have
no
positive
proofs
of
the
fact
but
in
my
opinion
ney
life
was
a
pledge
of
gratitude
which
fouche
thought
he
must
offer
to
the
foreign
influence
which
had
made
him
minister
about
this
time
i
learned
a
fact
which
will
create
no
surprise
as
it
affords
another
proof
of
the
chivalrous
disinterestedness
of
character
when
in
several
marshals
claimed
from
the
allied
powers
their
endowments
in
foreign
countries
madame
moreau
to
whom
the
king
had
given
the
honorary
title
of
la
marechale
and
who
was
the
friend
of
the
duke
of
tarentum
wrote
without
macdonald
knowledge
to
de
blacas
our
ambassador
at
naples
begging
him
to
endeavour
to
preserve
for
the
marshal
the
endowment
which
had
been
given
him
in
the
kingdom
of
naples
as
soon
as
macdonald
was
informed
of
this
circumstance
he
waited
upon
madame
moreau
thanked
her
for
her
kind
intentions
but
at
the
same
time
informed
her
that
he
should
disavow
all
knowledge
of
her
letter
as
the
request
it
contained
was
entirely
averse
to
his
principles
the
marshal
did
in
fact
write
the
following
letter
to
de
blacas
i
hasten
to
inform
you
sir
that
it
was
not
with
my
consent
that
madame
moreau
wrote
to
you
and
i
beg
you
will
take
no
step
that
might
expose
me
to
a
refusal
the
king
of
naples
owes
me
no
recompense
for
having
beaten
his
army
revolutionised
his
kingdom
and
forced
him
to
retire
to
sicily
such
conduct
was
well
worthy
of
the
man
who
was
the
last
to
forsake
napoleon
in
and
the
first
to
rejoin
him
and
that
without
the
desire
of
accepting
any
appointment
in
de
blacas
who
was
himself
much
surprised
at
macdonald
letter
communicated
it
to
the
king
of
naples
whose
answer
deserves
to
be
recorded
it
was
as
follows
if
i
had
not
imposed
a
law
upon
myself
to
acknowledge
none
of
the
french
endowments
the
conduct
of
marshal
macdonald
would
have
induced
me
to
make
an
exception
in
his
favour
it
is
gratifying
to
see
princes
such
scrupulous
observers
of
the
laws
they
make
for
themselves
about
the
end
of
august
as
i
was
walking
on
the
boulevard
des
capucines
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
rapp
whom
i
had
not
seen
for
a
long
time
he
had
just
come
out
of
the
house
of
lagrenee
the
artist
who
was
painting
his
portrait
i
was
on
foot
and
rapp
carriage
was
waiting
so
we
both
stepped
into
it
and
set
off
to
take
a
drive
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
we
had
a
great
deal
to
say
to
each
other
for
we
had
not
met
since
the
great
events
of
the
two
restorations
the
reason
of
this
was
that
in
i
passed
a
part
of
the
year
at
sens
and
since
the
occurrences
of
march
rapp
himself
had
been
absent
from
paris
i
found
him
perfectly
resigned
to
his
change
of
condition
though
indulging
in
a
few
oaths
against
the
foreigners
rapp
was
not
one
of
those
generals
who
betrayed
the
king
on
the
of
march
he
told
me
that
he
remained
at
the
head
of
the
division
which
he
commanded
at
ecouen
under
the
orders
of
the
due
de
berry
and
that
he
did
not
resign
it
to
the
war
minister
until
after
the
king
departure
how
did
napoleon
receive
you
i
inquired
i
waited
till
he
sent
for
me
you
know
what
sort
of
fellow
i
am
i
know
nothing
about
politics
not
i
had
sworn
fidelity
to
the
king
i
know
my
duty
and
i
would
have
fought
against
the
indeed
yes
certainly
i
would
and
i
told
him
so
how
did
you
venture
so
far
to
be
sure
i
told
him
that
my
resolution
was
definite
replied
he
angrily
knew
well
that
you
were
opposed
to
me
if
we
had
come
to
an
action
i
should
have
sought
you
out
on
the
field
of
battle
i
would
have
shown
you
the
medusa
head
would
you
have
dared
to
fire
on
me
doubt
i
replied
parbleu
this
is
too
much
he
said
your
troops
would
not
have
obeyed
you
they
had
preserved
all
their
affection
for
me
could
i
do
resumed
i
abdicated
you
left
france
you
recommended
us
to
serve
the
king
and
then
you
return
besides
i
tell
you
frankly
i
do
not
augur
well
of
what
will
happen
we
shall
have
war
again
france
has
had
enough
of
that
upon
this
continued
rapp
he
assured
me
that
he
had
other
thoughts
that
he
had
no
further
desire
for
war
that
he
wished
to
govern
in
peace
and
devote
himself
solely
to
the
happiness
of
his
people
when
i
hinted
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
foreign
powers
he
said
that
he
had
made
alliances
he
then
spoke
to
me
of
the
king
and
i
said
i
had
been
much
pleased
with
him
indeed
the
king
gave
me
a
very
gratifying
reception
on
my
return
from
kiow
and
i
see
no
reason
why
i
should
complain
when
i
am
so
well
used
during
the
conversation
the
emperor
much
extolled
the
conduct
of
the
duke
of
orleans
he
then
gave
me
some
description
of
his
passage
from
the
isle
of
elba
and
his
journey
to
paris
he
complained
of
being
accused
of
ambition
and
observing
that
i
looked
astonished
and
doubtful
he
continued
i
ambitious
then
and
patting
his
belly
with
both
his
hands
a
man
he
asked
fat
as
i
am
be
ambitious
i
could
not
for
my
soul
help
saying
sire
your
majesty
is
surely
joking
he
pretended
however
to
be
serious
and
after
a
few
moments
noticing
my
decorations
he
began
to
banter
me
about
the
cross
of
louis
and
the
cross
of
the
lily
which
i
still
wore
i
asked
rapp
whether
all
was
true
that
had
been
said
about
the
enthusiasm
which
was
manifested
along
the
whole
of
napoleon
route
from
the
gulf
of
juan
to
paris
ma
foe
he
replied
i
was
not
there
any
more
than
you
but
all
those
who
accompanied
him
have
assured
me
of
the
truth
of
the
details
which
have
been
published
but
i
recollect
having
heard
bertrand
say
that
on
one
occasion
he
was
fearful
for
the
safety
of
the
emperor
in
case
any
assassin
should
have
presented
himself
at
fossard
where
the
emperor
stopped
to
breakfast
on
his
way
to
paris
his
escort
was
so
fatigued
as
to
be
unable
to
follow
so
that
he
was
for
some
time
almost
alone
on
the
road
until
a
squadron
which
was
in
garrison
at
melun
met
him
and
escorted
him
to
fontainebleau
as
to
anything
else
from
all
i
have
heard
the
emperor
was
exposed
to
no
danger
we
then
began
to
talk
of
our
situation
and
the
singular
chances
of
our
fortune
rapp
told
me
how
within
a
few
days
only
he
had
ceased
to
be
one
of
the
discontented
for
the
condition
of
the
generals
who
had
commanded
army
corps
in
the
campaign
of
waterloo
was
very
different
in
from
what
it
had
been
in
i
had
determined
he
said
to
live
a
quiet
life
to
meddle
with
nothing
and
not
even
to
wear
my
uniform
i
had
therefore
since
the
king
return
never
presented
myself
at
court
when
a
week
ago
while
riding
on
horseback
two
or
three
hundred
paces
from
this
spot
i
saw
a
group
of
horsemen
on
the
other
side
of
the
avenue
one
of
whom
galloped
towards
me
i
immediately
recognised
the
duc
de
berry
monseigneur
is
it
you
i
exclaimed
is
my
dear
general
and
since
you
will
not
come
to
us
i
must
come
to
you
will
you
breakfast
with
me
tomorrow
morning
foi
continued
rapp
what
could
i
do
the
tone
of
kindness
in
which
he
gave
this
invitation
quite
charmed
me
i
went
and
i
was
treated
so
well
that
i
shall
go
again
but
i
will
ask
for
nothing
i
only
want
these
prussians
and
english
rascals
out
of
the
way
i
complimented
rapp
on
his
conduct
and
told
him
that
it
was
impossible
that
so
loyal
and
honest
a
man
as
he
should
not
at
some
time
or
other
attract
the
king
notice
i
had
the
happiness
to
see
this
prediction
accomplished
since
that
time
i
regularly
saw
rapp
whenever
we
both
happened
to
be
in
paris
which
was
pretty
often
i
have
already
mentioned
that
in
the
month
of
august
the
king
named
me
councillor
of
state
on
the
of
the
following
month
i
was
appointed
minister
of
state
and
member
of
the
privy
council
i
may
close
these
volumes
by
relating
a
circumstance
very
flattering
to
me
and
connected
with
the
nomination
the
king
had
directed
de
talleyrand
to
present
to
him
in
his
official
character
of
president
of
the
council
of
ministers
a
list
of
the
persons
who
might
be
deemed
suitable
as
members
of
the
privy
council
the
king
having
read
the
list
said
to
his
minister
but
de
talleyrand
i
do
not
see
here
the
names
of
two
of
our
best
friends
bourrienne
and
alexis
de
noailles
sire
i
thought
their
nomination
would
seem
more
flattering
in
coming
directly
from
your
majesty
the
king
then
added
my
name
to
the
list
and
afterwards
that
of
the
comte
alexis
de
noailles
so
that
both
our
names
are
written
in
louis
xviii
own
hand
in
the
original
ordinance
i
have
now
brought
to
a
conclusion
my
narrative
of
the
extraordinary
events
in
which
i
have
taken
part
either
as
a
spectator
or
an
actor
during
the
course
of
a
strangely
diversified
life
of
which
nothing
now
remains
but
recollections
i
discharged
the
functions
of
councillor
of
state
until
at
which
time
an
ordinance
appeared
declaring
those
functions
incompatible
with
the
title
of
minister
of
state

chapter
xii
the
cent
jours
the
extraordinary
rapidity
of
events
during
the
cent
fours
or
hundred
days
of
napoleon
reign
in
and
the
startling
changes
in
the
parts
previously
filled
by
the
chief
personages
make
it
difficult
to
consider
it
as
an
historical
period
it
more
resembles
a
series
of
sudden
theatrical
transformations
only
broken
by
the
great
pause
while
the
nation
waited
for
news
from
the
army
the
first
restoration
of
the
bourbons
had
been
so
unexpected
and
was
so
rapidly
carried
out
that
the
bonapartists
or
indeed
all
france
had
hardly
realized
the
situation
before
napoleon
was
again
in
the
tuileries
and
during
the
cent
jours
both
bonapartists
and
royalists
were
alike
rubbing
their
eyes
asking
whether
they
were
awake
and
wondering
which
was
the
reality
and
which
the
dream
the
empire
or
the
restoration
it
is
both
difficult
and
interesting
to
attempt
to
follow
the
history
of
the
chief
characters
of
the
period
and
the
reader
must
pardon
some
abrupt
transitions
from
person
to
person
and
from
group
to
group
while
the
details
of
some
subsequent
movements
of
the
bonaparte
family
must
be
thrown
in
to
give
a
proper
idea
of
the
strange
revolution
in
their
fortunes
we
may
divide
the
characters
with
which
we
have
to
deal
into
five
groups
the
bonaparte
family
the
marshals
the
statesmen
of
the
empire
the
bourbons
and
the
allied
monarchs
one
figure
and
one
name
will
be
missing
but
if
we
omit
all
account
of
poor
bleeding
mutilated
france
it
is
but
leaving
her
in
the
oblivion
in
which
she
was
left
at
the
time
by
every
one
except
by
napoleon
the
disaster
of
had
rather
dispersed
than
crushed
the
bonaparte
family
and
they
rallied
immediately
on
the
return
from
elba
the
final
fall
of
the
empire
was
total
ruin
to
them
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
of
fontainebleau
which
had
been
meant
to
ensure
a
maintenance
to
them
had
not
been
carried
out
while
napoleon
was
still
a
latent
power
and
after
the
bourbons
were
only
too
happy
to
find
a
reason
for
not
paying
a
debt
they
had
determined
never
to
liquidate
it
was
well
for
any
of
the
bourbons
in
their
days
of
distress
to
receive
the
bounty
of
the
usurper
but
there
was
a
peculiar
pleasure
in
refusing
to
pay
the
price
promised
for
his
immediate
abdication
the
flight
of
the

their
lives
a
bitter
struggle
with
poverty
fortunately
for
them
the
pope
the
king
of
holland
and
the
of
tuscany
were
not
under
heavy
obligations
to
napoleon
and
could
thus
afford
to
give
to
his
family
the
protection
denied
them
by
those
monarchs
who
believed
themselves
bound
to
redeem
their
former
servility
when
napoleon
landed
maria
louisa
was
in
austria
and
she
was
eager
to
assist
in
taking
every
precaution
to
prevent
her
son
the
young
king
of
rome
being
spirited
off
to
join

fortunes
she
had

bad
dream
she
obtained
the
of

where
she
reigned
till
marrying
a

said
the
count
bombellea
and
dying
just
too
soon
to
be
hunted
from
her
duchy
by
the
revolution
of
there
is
something
very
touching
in
most
that
we
know
of
the
poor
young
king
of
rome
from
his
childish
but
strangely
prescient
resistance
to
his
removal
from
paris
to
blois
on
the
approach
of
the
allies
in
to
the
message
of
remembrance
sent
in
after
years
to
the
column
of
the
place
vendome
his
only
friend
in
paris
at
four
years
of
age
meneval
describes
him
as
gentle
but
quick
in
answering
strong
and
with
excellent
health
light
curly
hair
in
ringlets
set
off
a
fresh
face
while
fine
blue
eyes
lit
up
his
regular
features
he
was
precociously
intelligent
and
knew
more
than
most
children
older
than
himself
when
meneval
the
former
secretary
of
his
father
giving
up
his
post
in
austria
with
maria
louisa
as
he
was
about
to
rejoin
napoleon
took
farewell
of
the
prince
in
may
the
poor
little
motherless
child
drew
me
towards
the
window
and
giving
me
a
touching
look
said
in
a
low
tone
monsieur
meva
tell
him
napoleon
that
i
always
love
him
dearly
we
say
motherless
because
maria
louisa
seems
to
have
yielded
up
her
child
at
the
dictates
of
policy
to
be
closely
guarded
as
easily
as
she
gave
up
her
husband
if
wrote
madame
de
montesquiou
his
governess
the
child
had
a
mother
i
would
leave
him
in
her
hands
and
be
happy
but
she
is
nothing
like
a
mother
she
is
more
indifferent
to
his
fate
than
the
most
utter
stranger
in
her
service
his
grandfather
the
emperor
francis
to
do
him
justice
seems
to
have
been
really
kind
to
the
lad
and
while
in
and
in
taking
care
to
deprive
him
of
all
chance
of
his
glorious
inheritance
still
seems
to
have
cared
for
him
personally
and
to
have
been
always
kind
to
him
there
is
no
truth
in
the
story
that
the
austrians
neglected
his
education
and
connived
at
the
ruin
of
his
faculties
both
his
tutor
the
count
maurice
dietrichstein
and
marshal
marmont
who
conversed
with
him
in
agree
in
speaking
highly
of
him
as
full
of
promise
marmont
evidence
being
especially
valuable
as
showing
that
the
austrians
did
not
object
to
the
duke
of
reichstadt
as
he
had
been
created
by
his
grandfather
in
learning
all
be
could
of
his
father
life
from
one
of
the
marshals
in
marment
describes
him
i
recognised
his
father
look
in
him
and
in
that
he
most
resembled
napoleon
his
eyes
not
so
large
as
those
of
napoleon
and
sunk
deeper
in
their
sockets
had
the
same
expression
the
same
fire
the
same
energy
his
forehead
was
like
that
of
his
father
and
so
was
the
lower
part
of
his
face
and
his
chin
then
his
complexion
was
that
of
napoleon
in
his
youth
with
the
same
pallor
and
the
same
colour
of
the
skin
but
all
the
rest
of
his
face
recalled
his
mother
and
the
house
of
austria
he
was
taller
than
napoleon
by
about
three
inches
as
long
as
the
duke
lived
his
name
was
naturally
the
of
the
bonapartes
and
was
mentioned
in
some
of
the
many
conspiracies
against
the
bourbons
in
joseph
bonaparte
tried
to
get
the
sanction
of
the
austrians
to
his
nephew
being
put
forward
as
a
claimant
to
the
throne
of
france
vacant
by
the
flight
of
charles
but
they
held
their
captive
firmly
a
very
interesting
passage
is
given
in
the
of
charles
greville
who
says
that
prince
esterhazy
told
him
a
great
deal
about
the
duke
of
reichstadt
who
if
he
had
lived
would
have
probably
played
a
great
part
in
the
world
he
died
of
a
premature
decay
brought
on
apparently
by
and
his
talents
were
very
conspicuous
he
was
worshipped
the
memory
of
his
father
and
for
that
reason
never
liked
his
mother
his
thoughts
were
incessantly
turned
towards
france
and
when
he
heard
of
the
days
of
july
overthrow
of
charles
x
he
said
why
was
i
not
there
to
take
my
chance
he
evinced
great
affection
and
gratitude
to
his
grandfather
who
while
he
scrupulously
observed
all
his
obligations
towards
louis
philippe
could
not
help
feeling
a
secret
pride
in
the
aspiring
genius
of
napoleon
son
he
was
well
educated
and
day
and
night
pored
over
the
history
of
his
father
glorious
career
he
delighted
in
military
exercises
and
not
only
shone
at
the
head
of
his
regiment
but
had
already
acquired
the
hereditary
art
of
ingratiating
himself
with
the
soldiers
esterhazy
went
on
to
describe
how
the
duke
abandoned
everything
at
a
ball
when
he
met
there
marshals
marmont
and
maison
he
had
no
eyes
or
ears
but
for
them
from
nine
in
the
evening
to
five
the
next
morning
he
devoted
himself
to
these
marshals
there
was
the
true
napoleonic
ring
in
his
answer
to
advice
given
by
marmont
when
the
duke
said
that
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
put
forward
by
the
sovereigns
of
europe
the
son
of
napoleon
should
be
too
great
to
serve
as
an
instrument
and
in
events
of
that
nature
i
wish
not
to
be
an
advanced
guard
but
a
reserve
that
is
to
come
as
a
succour
recalling
great
memories
his
death
in
on
the
of
july
the
anniversary
of
the
battle
of
salamanca
solved
many
questions
metternich
visited
the
duke
on
his
deathbed
it
was
a
heartrending
sight
i
never
remember
to
have
seen
a
more
mournful
picture
of
decay
when
francis
was
told
of
the
death
of
his
grandson
he
answered
i
look
upon
the
duke
death
as
a
blessing
for
him
whether
it
be
detrimental
or
otherwise
to
the
public
good
i
do
not
know
as
for
myself
i
shall
ever
lament
the
loss
of
my
grandson
josephine
was
in
her
grave
at
rueil
when
napoleon
returned
she
had
died
on
the
of
may
at
malmaison
while
the
allies
were
exhibiting
themselves
in
paris
it
seems
hard
that
she
should
not
have
lived
to
enjoy
a
triumph
however
brief
over
her
austrian
rival
she
at
least
said
napoleon
truly
would
never
have
abandoned
me
josephine
daughter
hortense
separated
from
her
husband
louis
bonaparte
and
created
duchess
of
st
leu
by
louis
was
in
paris
much
suspected
by
the
bourbons
but
really
engaged
in
a
lawsuit
with
her
husband
about
the
custody
of
her
sons
she
had
to
go
into
hiding
when
the
news
of
the
landing
arrived
but
her
empty
house
left
unwatched
became
very
useful
for
receiving
the
bonapartists
who
wished
for
a
place
of
concealment
amongst
them
as
we
shall
see
being
of
all
people
fouche
hortense
was
met
by
napoleon
with
some
reproaches
for
accepting
a
title
from
the
bourbons
but
she
did
the
honours
of
the
elysee
for
him
and
it
is
creditable
to
both
of
them
that
braving
the
vile
slanders
about
their
intercourse
she
was
with
him
to
the
end
and
that
one
of
the
last
persons
to
embrace
him
at
malmaison
before
he
started
for
the
coast
was
his
adopted
daughter
the
child
of
his
discarded
wife
presence
in
paris
was
thought
to
be
too
dangerous
by
the
prussian
governor
and
she
was
peremptorily
ordered
to
leave
an
appeal
to
the
emperor
francis
received
a
favourable
answer
but
francis
always
gave
way
where
any
act
against
his
was
in
question
and
she
had
to
start
at
the
shortest
notice
on
a
wandering
life
to
aix
baden
and
constance
till
the
generosity
of
the
small
but
brave
canton
of
thurgau
enabled
her
to
get
a
at
the
chateau
of
arenenberg
in
she
lost
her
second
son
the
eldest
then
surviving
who
died
from
fever
in
a
revolutionary
attempt
ill
which
he
and
his
younger
brother
the
future
napoleon
were
engaged
she
was
able
to
visit
france
incognita
and
even
to
see
louis
philippe
and
his
queen
but
her
presence
in
the
country
was
soon
thought
dangerous
and
she
was
urged
to
leave
in
hortense
last
child
louis
napoleon
made
his
attempt
at
an
at
strasburg
and
was
shipped
off
to
america
by
the
government
she
went
to
france
to
plead
for
him
and
then
worn
out
by
grief
and
anxiety
returned
to
arenenberg
which
her
son
the
future
emperor
only
succeeded
in
reaching
in
time
to
see
her
die
in
october
she
was
laid
with
josephine
at
rueil
hortense
brother
prince
eugene
the
viceroy
of
italy
was
at
vienna
when
napoleon
returned
and
fell
under
the
suspicion
of
the
allies
of
having
informed
the
emperor
of
the
intention
of
removing
him
from
elba
he
was
detained
in
bavaria
by
his
the
king
to
whose
court
he
retired
and
who
in
created
him
duke
of
leuchtenberg
and
prince
of
eichstadt
with
the
protection
of
bavaria
he
actually
succeeded
in
wringing
from
the
bourbons
some
francs
of
the
property
of
his
mother
a
first
attack
of
apoplexy
struck
him
in
and
he
died
from
a
second
in
february
at
munich
his
descendants
have
intermarried
into
the
royal
families
of
portugal
sweden
brazil
russia
wartemberg
his
grandson
now
holds
the
title
of
leuchtenberg
except
louis
an
invalid
all
the
brothers
of
the
emperor
were
around
him
in
the
cent
jours
the
supreme
effort
of
their
family
joseph
had
left
spain
after
vittoria
and
had
remained
in
an
uncomfortable
and
unrecognised
state
near
paris
until
in
he
was
again
employed
and
when
rightly
or
not
he
urged
the
retreat
of
the
regency
from
paris
to
blois
he
then
took
refuge
at
his
chateau
of
prangins
in
the
canton
vaud
in
switzerland
closely
watched
by
the
bourbonists
who
dreaded
danger
from
every
side
except
the
real
point
and
who
preferred
trying
to
hunt
the
bonapartists
from
place
to
place
instead
of
making
their
life
bearable
by
carrying
out
the
engagements
with
them
in
escaping
from
the
arrest
with
which
he
was
threatened
after
having
written
to
urge
murat
to
action
with
fatal
effect
joseph
joined
napoleon
in
paris
and
appeared
at
the
champ
de
mai
sitting
also
in
the
chamber
of
peers
but
as
before
putting
forward
ridiculous
pretensions
as
to
his
inherent
right
to
the
peerage
and
claiming
a
special
seat
in
fact
he
never
could
realise
how
entirely
he
owed
any
position
to
the
brother
he
wished
to
treat
as
an
equal
he
remained
in
paris
during
the
brief
campaign
and
after
waterloo
was
concealed
in
the
house
of
the
swedish
ambassador
where
his
law
the
crown
princess
of
sweden
the
wife
of
bernadotte
was
living
muffling
the
prussian
governor
of
paris
wished
to
arrest
him
but
as
the
governor
could
not
violate
the
domicile
of
an
ambassador
he
had
to
apply
to
the
czar
who
arranged
for
the
escape
of
the
before
the
governor
could
seize
him
joseph
went
to
the
coast
pretty
much
following
the
route
of
napoleon
he
was
arrested
once
at
saintes
but
was
allowed
to
proceed
and
he
met
his
brother
on
the
of
july
at
rochefort
it
is
significant
as
to
the
possibility
of
the
escape
of
napoleon
that
joseph
succeeded
in
getting
on
the
brig
commerce
as
bouchard
and
though
the
ship
was
thrice
searched
by
the
english
he
got
to
new
york
on
the
of
august
where
he
was
mistaken
for
carnot
he
was
well
received
and
taking
the
title
of
comte
de
survilliers
he
first
lived
at
lansdowne
fairmount
park
philadelphia
where
he
afterwards
always
passed
part
of
the
year
while
he
was
in
america
he
also
bought
the
property
of
point
breeze
at
bordentown
on
the
delaware
where
he
built
a
house
with
a
fine
view
of
the
river
this
first
house
was
burnt
down
but
he
erected
another
where
he
lived
in
some
state
and
in
great
comfort
displaying
his
jewels
and
pictures
to
his
admiring
neighbours
and
showing
kindness
to
impecunious
nephews
the
news
of
the
revolution
of
july
in
which
drove
charles
from
the
throne
excited
joseph
hopes
for
the
family
of
which
he
considered
himself
the
regent
and
he
applied
to
metternich
to
get
the
austrian
government
to
allow
or
assist
in
the
placing
his
nephew
the
duke
of
reichstadt
on
the
throne
of
france
austria
would
not
even
answer
in
july
joseph
crossed
to
england
where
he
met
lucien
just
arrived
from
italy
bringing
the
news
of
the
death
of
his
nephew
disappointed
he
stayed
in
england
for
some
time
but
returned
to
america
in
in
he
finally
left
america
and
again
came
to
england
where
he
had
a
paralytic
stroke
and
in
he
went
to
florence
where
he
met
his
wife
after
a
long
separation
joseph
lived
long
enough
to
see
the
two
attempts
of
another
nephew
louis
napoleon
at
strasburg
in
and
at
boulogne
in
which
seem
to
have
been
undertaken
without
his
knowledge
and
to
have
much
surprised
him
he
died
in
florence
in
his
body
was
buried
first
in
santa
croce
florence
but
was
removed
to
the
invalides
in
his
wife
the
had
retired
in
to
frankfort
and
to
brussels
where
she
was
well
received
by
the
king
william
and
where
she
stayed
till
when
she
went
to
florence
dying
there
in
her
monument
is
in
the
cappella
riccardi
santa
croce
florence
lucien
had
retired
to
rome
in
on
the
creation
of
the
empire
and
had
continued
embroiled
with
his
brother
partly
from
his
republican
principles
but
chiefly
from
his
adhering
to
his
marriage
his
second
one
with
madame
jouberthon
a
union
which
napoleon
steadily
refused
to
acknowledge
offering
lucien
anything
a
kingdom
or
the
hand
of
a
queen
if
we
take
lucien
account
if
he
would
only
consent
to
the
annulment
of
the
contract
in
august
affecting
uneasiness
as
napoleon
stretched
his
power
over
rome
lucien
embarked
for
america
but
he
was
captured
by
the
english
and
taken
first
to
malta
and
then
to
england
where
he
passed
the
years
till
in
a
sort
of
honourable
captivity
first
at
ludlow
and
then
at
thorngrove
not
far
from
that
town
in
lucien
was
released
when
he
went
to
rome
where
he
was
welcomed
by
the
kindly
old
pope
who
remembered
the
benefits
conferred
by
napoleon
on
the
church
while
he
forgot
the
injuries
personal
to
himself
and
the
republican
the
brutus
bonaparte
accepted
the
title
of
duke
of
musignano
and
prince
of
canino
in
lucien
joined
his
brother
whom
he
wished
to
abdicate
at
the
champ
de
mai
in
favour
of
the
king
of
rome
placing
his
sword
only
at
the
disposal
of
france
this
step
was
seriously
debated
but
though
it
might
have
placed
the
allies
in
a
more
difficult
position
it
would
certainly
have
been
disregarded
by
them
at
least
unless
some
great
victory
had
given
the
dynasty
firmer
footing
after
waterloo
he
was
in
favour
of
a
dissolution
of
the
chambers
but
napoleon
had
become
hopeless
and
almost
apathetic
while
lucien
himself
from
his
former
connection
with
the
and
brumaire
was
looked
on
with
great
distrust
by
the
chambers
as
indeed
he
was
by
his
brother
advantage
was
taken
of
his
roman
title
to
taunt
him
with
not
being
a
frenchman
and
all
his
efforts
failed
at
the
end
he
fled
and
failing
to
cross
to
england
or
to
get
to
rochefort
he
reached
turin
on
the
of
july
only
to
find
himself
arrested
he
remained
there
till
the
of
september
when
he
was
allowed
to
go
to
rome
there
he
was
interned
and
carefully
watched
indeed
in
the
pope
had
to
intervene
to
prevent
his
removal
to
the
north
of
germany
so
anxious
were
the
allies
as
to
the
safety
of
the
puppet
they
had
put
on
the
throne
of
france
the
death
of
napoleon
in
released
lucien
and
the
bonaparte
family
from
the
constant
surveillance
exercised
over
them
till
then
in
he
bought
a
property
the
croce
del
biacco
near
bologna
the
flight
of
the
elder
branch
of
the
bourbons
from
france
in
raised
his
hopes
and
as
already
said
he
went
to
england
in
to
meet
joseph
and
to
plan
some
step
for
raising
napoleon
ii
to
the
throne
the
news
of
the
death
of
his
nephew
dashed
all
the
hopes
of
the
family
and
after
staying
in
england
for
some
time
he
returned
to
italy
dying
at
viterbo
in
and
being
buried
at
canino
where
also
his
second
wife
lies
lucien
had
a
taste
for
literature
and
was
the
author
of
several
works
which
a
kindly
posterity
will
allow
to
die
louis
bonaparte
had
fled
from
his
kingdom
of
holland
in
after
a
short
reign
of
four
years
disgusted
with
being
expected
to
study
the
interests
of
the
brother
to
whom
he
owed
his
throne
and
with
being
required
to
treat
his
wife
hortense
with
ordinary
consideration
he
had
taken
refuge
in
austria
putting
that
court
in
great
anxiety
how
to
pay
him
the
amount
of
attention
to
be
expected
by
the
brother
of
the
emperor
and
at
the
same
time
the
proper
coldness
napoleon
might
wish
shown
to
a
royal
deserter
thanks
to
the
suggestions
of
metternich
they
seem
to
have
been
successful
in
this
task
taking
the
title
of
comte
de
len
from
an
estate
in
france
louis
went
first
to
toplitz
then
to
gratz
and
in
he
took
refuge
in
switzerland
in
he
went
to
rome
and
then
to
florence
where
the
ferdinand
received
any
of
the
family
who
came
there
with
great
kindness
louis
was
the
least
interesting
of
the
family
and
it
is
difficult
to
excuse
his
absence
from
france
in
after
all
the
present
of
a
kingdom
is
not
such
an
unpardonable
offence
as
to
separate
brothers
for
ever
and
napoleon
seems
to
have
felt
deeply
the
way
in
which
he
was
treated
by
a
brother
to
whom
he
had
acted
as
a
father
still
and
the
natural
selfishness
of
invalids
may
account
for
much
while
his
son
louis
napoleon
was
flying
about
making
his
attempts
on
france
louis
remained
in
the
roman
palace
of
the
french
academy
sunk
in
anxiety
about
his
religious
state
he
disclaimed
his
son
proceedings
but
this
may
have
been
due
to
the
pope
who
sheltered
him
anyhow
it
is
strange
to
mark
the
difference
between
the
father
and
his
two
sons
who
came
of
age
and
who
took
to
revolution
so
kindly
in
louis
was
ill
at
leghorn
when
his
son
escaped
from
ham
where
he
had
been
imprisoned
after
his
boulogne
attempt
passports
were
refused
to
the
son
to
go
from
italy
to
his
father
and
louis
died
alone
on
the
of
july
he
was
buried
at
santa
croce
florence
but
the
body
was
afterwards
removed
to
the
village
church
of
leu
taverny
rebuilt
by
his
son
napoleon
iii
jerome
the
youngest
of
the
whole
family
the
middy
as
napoleon
liked
to
call
him
had
been
placed
in
the
navy
in
which
profession
he
passed
as
having
distinguished
himself
after
leaving
his
admiral
in
rather
a
peculiar
manner
by
attacking
an
english
convoy
and
eventually
escaping
the
english
by
running
into
the
port
of
concarneau
believed
to
be
inaccessible
at
that
time
it
was
an
event
for
a
french
to
reach
home
jerome
had
incurred
the
anger
of
napoleon
by
marrying
a
beautiful
young
lady
of
baltimore
a
mica
paterson
but
more
obedient
than
lucien
he
submitted
to
have
this
marriage
annulled
by
his
brother
and
in
reward
he
received
the
kingdom
of
westphalia
and
the
hand
of
a
daughter
of
the
king
of
wartemberg
the
cleverest
king
in
europe
according
to
napoleon
jerome
is
said
to
have
ruled
rather
more
as
a
heliogabalus
than
a
solomon
but
the
new
kingdom
had
the
advantage
of
starting
with
good
administrators
and
with
the
example
of
the
code
in
jerome
was
given
the
command
of
the
right
wing
of
the
grand
army
in
its
advance
against
russia
but
he
did
not
fulfil
the
expectations
of
his
brother
and
davoust
took
the
command
instead
every
king
feels
himself
a
born
general
whatever
else
they
can
not
do
war
is
an
art
which
comes
with
the
crown
and
jerome
unwilling
to
serve
under
a
mere
marshal
withdrew
in
disgust
in
he
had
the
good
feeling
and
the
good
sense
to
refuse
the
treacherous
offer
of
the
allies
to
allow
him
to
retain
his
kingdom
if
he
joined
them
against
his
brother
a
snare
his
sister
caroline
fell
into
at
naples
on
the
downfall
of
napoleon
jerome
as
the
count
of
gratz
went
to
switzerland
and
then
to
gratz
and
trieste
his

appeared
at

a
true
bonaparte
his
vanity
was
much
hurt
however
by
having
he
a
real
king
to
sit
on
the
back
seat
of
the
carriage
while
his
elder
brother
lucien
a
mere
occupied
a
seat
of
honour

the
side
of

formed
the

was
engaged
in
the
struggle
for

post
whatever
his
failings
may
have
been
he
is
acknowledged
to
have
fought
gallantly
after
the
battle
he
was
given
the
command
of
the
army
by
his
brother
and
was
told
to
cover
the
retreat
to

which
he
reached
on
the
of
june
with
infantry
cavalry
and
two
batteries
which
he
had
rallied
this
be
it
observed
is
a
larger

than
ney
told

chambers
even
grouchy
none
of
whose
men
are
included
could
have
and
jerome
strength
had
swollen
to
infantry
and

when
he
handed
over
the
army
to
soult
at
laon
napoleon
had
intended
to
leave
jerome
with
the
command
of
the
army
but
he
eventually
took
him
to
paris
when
napoleon
left
the
country
jerome
was
assured
by
the
ambassador
of
wurtemberg
that
he
would
find
a
refuge
in
the
dominions
of
his
law
but
when
he
arrived
there
he
was
informed
that
if
he
did
not
wish
to
be
according
to
the
original
intentions
of
the
allies
handed
over
to
the
prussians
and
separated
from
his
wife
he
must
sign
an
engagement
to
remain
in
wurtemberg
under
strict
surveillance
he
was
then
imprisoned
at
guppingen
and
afterwards
at
ellwangen
where
he
was
not
even
allowed
to
write
or
receive
letters
except
through
the
captain
of
the
chateau
part
of
jerome
troubles
came
from
the
conduct
of
his
wife
catherine
who
had
the
idea
that
as
she
had
been
given
in
marriage
by
her
father
to
jerome
as
she
had
lived
for
seven
years
as
his
wife
and
as
she
had
borne
a
child
to
him
she
was
really
his
wife
and
bound
to
remain
with
him
in
his
misfortunes
the
royal
family
of
wurtemberg
however
following
the
illustrious
example
of
that
of
austria
looked
on
her
past
life
as
a
mere
state
of
concubinage
useful
to
the
family
and
to
be
respected
while
her
husband
could
retain
his
kingdom
but
which
should
end
the
moment
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
gained
from
napoleon
or
his
brother
it
was
all
proper
and
decorous
to
retain
the
title
of
king
of
wurtemberg
which
the
former
duke
and
then
elector
had
owed
to
the
exile
of
helena
but
king
frederick
and
still
less
his
son
william
who
succeeded
him
in
could
not
comprehend
catherine
clinging
to
her
husband
when
he
had
lost
his
kingdom
i
was
a
queen
i
am
still
a
wife
and
mother
wrote
the
princess
to
her
disgusted
father
another
complaint
against
this
extraordinary
princess
was
that
she
actually
saw
las
cases
on
his
return
from
helena
and
thus
obtained
news
of
the
exile
after
constant
ill
treatment
jerome
and
his
wife
as
the
count
and
countess
of
montfort
a
rank
the
king
of
wurtemberg
afterwards
raised
to
prince
were
allowed
to
proceed
to
hainburg
near
vienna
then
to
florence
and
later
to
trieste
where
jerome
was
when
his
sister
elisa
died
in
they
were
permitted
to
go
to
rome
and
in
they
went
to
lausanne
where
his
wife
died
the
same
year
jerome
went
to
florence
and
lived
to
see
the
revival
of
the
empire
and
to
once
mare
enjoy
the
rank
of
a
french
prince
he
died
in
at
the
chateau
of
villegenis
in
france
and
was
buried
in
the
invalides
the
mother
of
the
emperor
letitia
in
had
retained
her
title
of
imperatrice
mere
and
had
retired
to
rome
she
then
went
to
elba
in
june
and
stayed
there
with
her
daughter
pauline
until
napoleon
had
sailed
for
france
on
march
she
went
from
elba
to
san
vicenzo
near
leghorn
and
then
to
rome
her
son
sent
a
frigate
for
her
the
which
was
captured
by
the
english
another
vessel
the
brought
her
to
france
and
she
joined
napoleon
in
paris
we
must
have
a
regard
for
this
simple
old
lady
who
was
always
careful
and
saving
only
half
believing
in
the
stability
of
the
empire
and
like
a
true
mother
always
most
attentive
to
the
most
unfortunate
of
her
children
her
life
had
been
full
of
startling
changes
and
it
must
have
been
strange
for
the
woman
who
had
been
hunted
out
of
corsica
flying
from
her
house
just
in
time
to
save
her
life
from
the
adherents
of
paoli
to
find
herself
in
grandeur
in
paris
she
saw
her
son
just
before
he
left
as
she
thought
for
america
and
then
retired
to
the
rinuccini
now
the
at
rome
where
she
died
in
she
had
been
anxious
to
join
napoleon
at
helena
and
had
refused
as
long
as
napoleon
was
alive
to
forgive
her
daughter
caroline
the
wife
of
murat
for
her
abandonment
of
her
brother
she
was
buried
at
albano
letitia
youngest
daughter
the
beautiful
but
frail
pauline
duchess
of
guastalla
married
first
to
general
leclerc
and
then
to
prince
camille
borglle
was
at
nice
when
her
brother
abdicated
in
she
retired
with
her
mother
to
rome
and
in
october
went
to
elba
staying
there
till
napoleon
left
except
when
she
was
sent
to
naples
with
a
message
of
forgiveness
for
murat
there
was
a
characteristic
scene
between
her
and
colonel
campbell
when
the
english
commissioner
arrived
to
find
napoleon
gone
pauline
professed
ignorance
till
the
last
of
her
intentions
and
pressed
the
colonel
hand
to
her
heart
that
lie
might
feel
how
agitated
she
was
she
did
not
appear
to
be
so
says
the
battered
old
colonel
who
seems
to
have
been
proof
against
her
charms
she
then
went
to
rome
and
later
to
pisa
her
health
was
failing
and
unable
to
join
her
brother
in
france
she
sent
him
her
only
means
of
assistance
her
jewels
which
were
captured
at
waterloo
her
offer
to
go
to
helena
repeated
several
times
was
never
accepted
by
napoleon
she
died
in
at
florence
from
consumption
reconciled
to
her
husband
from
whom
she
had
been
separated
since
she
was
buried
at
sta
maria
maggiore
rome
elisa
the
eldest
sister
of
napoleon
the
former
grand
duchess
of
tuscany
which
duchy
she
had
ruled
well
being
a
woman
of
considerable
talent
was
the
first
of
all
to
die
in
she
had
been
forced
to
fly
from
her
government
and
accompanied
by
her
husband
she
had
attempted
to
reach
france
finding
herself
cut
off
by
the
austrians
she
took
shelter
with
augereau
army
and
then
returned
to
italy
she
took
the
title
of
comtesse
de
campignana
and
retired
to
trieste
near
which
town
at
the
chateau
of
sant
andrea
under
a
wearisome
surveillance
she
expired
in
watched
by
her
husband
felix
baeciocchi
and
her
sister
caroline
her
monument
is
in
the
bacciocchi
chapel
in
san
petronio
bologna
caroline
the
wife
of
murat
was
the
only
one
of
the
family
untrue
to
napoleon
very
ambitious
and
forgetting
how
completely
she
owed
her
kingdom
of
naples
to
her
brother
she
had
urged
murat
in
to
separate
from
napoleon
and
still
worse
to
attack
eugene
who
held
the
north
of
italy
against
the
austrians
she
relied
on
the
formal
treaty
with
austria
that
murat
should
retain
his
kingdom
of
naples
and
she
may
also
have
trusted
to
the
good
offices
of
her
former
admirer
metternich
when
the
congress
of
vienna
met
the
french
minister
talleyrand
at
once
began
to
press
for
the
removal
of
murat
a
trifling
treaty
was
not
considered
an
obstacle
to
the
deliverers
of
europe
and
murat
believing
his
fate
sealed
hearing
of
napoleon
landing
and
urged
on
by
a
misleading
letter
from
joseph
bonaparte
at
once
marched
to
attack
the
austrians
he
was
easily
routed
by
the
austrians
under
neipperg
the
future
husband
of
maria
louisa
murat
fled
to
france
and
caroline
first
took
refuge
in
an
english
the
being
promised
a
free
passage
to
england
she
was
however
handed
over
to
the
austrians
who
kept
her
in
confinement
at
hainburg
near
vienna
in
october
murat
landed
in
calabria
in
a
last
wild
attempt
to
recover
his
throne
he
was
arrested
and
immediately
shot
after
his
murder
caroline
taking
the
title
of
countess
of
lipona
an
anagram
of
napoli
was
permitted
to
retire
to
trieste
with
elisa
jerome
and
his
wife
caroline
was
almost
without
means
of
existence
the
neapolitan
bourbons
refusing
even
to
give
up
the
property
she
had
brought
there
she
married
a
general
macdonald
when
hortense
was
buried
at
rueil
caroline
obtained
permission
to
attend
the
sad
ceremony
in
she
went
to
france
to
try
to
obtain
a
pension
and
succeeded
in
getting
one
of
francs
she
died
from
cancer
in
the
stomach
in
and
was
buried
in
the
campo
santo
bologna
cardinal
fesch
the
of
napoleon
the
archbishop
of
lyons
who
had
fallen
into
disgrace
with
napoleon
for
taking
the
side
of
the
pope
and
refusing
to
accept
the
see
of
paris
to
which
he
was
nominated
by
napoleon
had
retired
to
rome
in
where
he
remained
till
the
return
of
napoleon
when
he
went
to
paris
and
accepted
a
peerage
after
waterloo
he
again
sought
the
protection
of
the
pope
and
he
remained
at
rome
till
his
death
in
a
few
days
before
caroline
bonaparte
he
was
buried
in
lorenzo
in
lucina
rome
he
had
for
years
been
a
great
collector
of
pictures
of
which
he
left
a
large
number
to
the
town
of
ajaccio
the
cardinal
buying
at
the
right
time
when
few
men
had
either
enough
leisure
or
money
to
think
of
pictures
got
together
a
most
valuable
collection
this
was
sold
in
at
rome
its
contents
now
form
some
of
the
greatest
treasures
in
the
galleries
of
dudley
house
and
of
the
marquis
of
hertford
now
sir
richard
wallace
in
a
large
collection
there
are
generally
some
daubs
but
it
is
an
amusing
instance
of
party
spirit
to
find
the
value
of
his
pictures
run
down
by
men
who
are
unwilling
to
allow
any
one
connected
with
napoleon
to
have
even
taste
in
art
he
always
refused
the
demands
of
the
restoration
that
he
should
resign
his
see
of
lyons
though
under
louis
philippe
he
offered
to
do
so
and
leave
his
pictures
to
france
if
the
bonaparte
family
were
allowed
to
enter
france
this
was
refused
it
can
hardly
be
denied
that
the
fate
of
the
bonapartes
was
a
hard
one
napoleon
had
been
undisputed
sovereign
of
france
for
fourteen
years
louis
had
been
king
of
holland
for
four
years
jerome
was
king
of
westphalia
for
six
years
caroline
was
queen
of
naples
for
seven
years
if
napoleon
had
forfeited
all
his
rights
by
leaving
elba
after
the
conditions
of
his
abdication
had
been
broken
by
the
allies
still
there
was
no
reason
why
the
terms
stipulated
for
the
other
members
of
the
family
should
not
have
been
carried
out
or
at
least
an
ordinary
income
insured
to
them
with
all
napoleon
faults
he
was
always
ready
to
shower
wealth
on
the
victims
of
his
policy
the
sovereigns
of
the
continent
had
courted
and
intermarried
with
the
bonapartes
in
the
tame
of
that
family
grandeur
there
was
neither
generosity
nor
wisdom
in
treating
them
as
so
many
criminals
the
moment
fortune
had
declared
against
them
the
conduct
of
the
allies
was
not
influenced
simply
by
the
principle
of
legitimacy
for
the
king
of
saxony
only
kept
his
throne
by
the
monarchs
falling
out
over
the
spoil
if
sovereigns
were
to
be
respected
as
of
divine
appointment
it
was
not
well
to
make
their
existence
only
depend
on
the
fate
of
war
nothing
in
the
history
of
the
cent
jours
is
more
strange
than
the
small
part
played
in
it
by
the
marshals
the
very
men
who
are
so
identified
in
our
minds
with
the
emperor
that
we
might
have
expected
to
find
that
brilliant
band
playing
a
most
prominent
part
in
his
last
great
struggle
no
longer
for
mere
victory
but
for
very
existence
in
recording
how
the
guard
came
up
the
fatal
hill
at
waterloo
for
their
last
combat
it
would
seem
but
natural
to
have
to
give
a
long
roll
of
the
old
historic
names
as
leading
or
at
least
accompanying
them
and
the
reader
is
apt
to
ask
where
were
the
men
whose
very
titles
recalled
such
glorious
fields
such
achievements
and
such
rewards
showered
down
by
the
man
who
almost
alone
at
the
end
of
the
day
rode
forward
to
invite
that
death
from
which
it
was
such
cruel
kindness
to
save
him
only
three
marshals
were
in
belgium
in
and
even
of
them
one
did
but
count
his
promotion
from
that
very
year
so
it
is
but
natural
for
french
writers
to
dream
of
what
might
have
been
the
course
of
the
battle
if
murat
plume
had
waved
with
the
cavalry
if
mortier
had
been
with
the
guard
and
if
davoust
or
one
of
his
tried
brethren
had
taken
the
place
of
grouchy
there
is
however
little
real
ground
for
surprise
at
this
absence
of
the
marshals
death
time
and
hardships
had
all
done
their
work
amongst
that
grand
array
of
commanders
some
were
old
men
veterans
of
the
revolutionary
wars
when
first
created
marshals
in
others
such
as
massena
were
now
but
the
wreck
of
themselves
and
even
before
napoleon
had
been
struck
with
the
failing
energy
of
some
of
his
original
companions
indeed
it
might
have
been
better
for
him
if
he
had
in
as
he
half
resolved
cast
away
his
dislike
to
new
faces
and
fought
his
last
desperate
campaigns
with
younger
men
who
still
had
fortunes
to
win
leaving
berthier
to
hunt
at
grosbois
and
the
other
marshals
to
enjoy
their
rest
in
their
splendid
hotels
at
paris
davoust
duke
of
auerstadt
prince
of
eckmuhl
whose
name
should
be
properly
spelt
davout
was
one
of
the
principal
personages
at
the
end
of
the
cent
jours
strict
and
severe
having
his
corps
always
in
good
order
and
displaying
more
character
than
most
of
the
military
men
under
napoleon
one
is
apt
to
believe
that
the
conqueror
at
auerstadt
bade
fair
to
be
the
most
prominent
of
all
the
marshals
in
he
had
returned
from
defending
hamburg
to
find
himself
under
a
cloud
of
accusations
and
the
bourbons
ungenerously
and
unwisely
left
him
undefended
for
acts
which
they
must
have
known
were
part
of
his
duty
as
governor
of
a
besieged
place
at
the
time
he
was
attacked
as
if
his
first
duty
was
not
to
hold
the
place
for
france
but
to
organise
a
system
of
outdoor
relief
for
the
neighbouring
population
and
to
surrender
as
soon
as
he
had
exhausted
the
money
in
the
government
chest
and
the
provisions
in
the
government
stores
sore
and
discontented
practically
proscribed
still
davoust
would
not
join
in
the
too
hasty
enterprise
of
the
brothers
lallemand
who
wished
him
to
lead
the
military
rising
on
the
approach
of
napoleon
but
he
was
with
the
emperor
on
the
day
after
his
arrival
in
paris
davoust
might
have
expected
high
command
in
the
army
but
to
his
annoyance
napoleon
fixed
on
him
as
war
minister
for
several
years
the
war
minister
had
been
little
more
than
a
clerk
and
neither
had
nor
was
expected
to
have
much
influence
with
the
army
napoleon
now
wanted
a
man
of
tried
devotion
and
of
stern
enough
character
to
overawe
the
capital
and
the
restless
spirits
in
the
army
much
against
his
will
davoust
was
therefore
forced
to
content
himself
with
the
organisation
of
the
forces
being
hastily
raised
but
he
chafed
in
his
position
and
it
is
characteristic
of
him
that
napoleon
was
eventually
forced
to
send
him
the
most
formal
orders
before
the
surly
minister
would
carry
out
the
emperor
unlucky
intention
of
giving
a
command
to
bourmont
whom
davoust
strongly
and
rightly
suspected
of
treachery
when
napoleon
left
the
capital
davoust
became
its
governor
and
held
his
post
unmoved
by
the
intrigues
of
the
republicans
and
the
royalists
when
napoleon
returned
from
the
great
disaster
davoust
gave
his
voice
for
the
only
wise
policy
resistance
and
the
prorogation
of
the
factious
chambers
on
the
abdication
of
napoleon
the
provisional
government
necessarily
gave
davoust
the
command
of
the
army
which
was
concentrated
round
paris
if
davoust
had
restricted
himself
less
closely
to
his
duty
as
a
soldier
if
he
had
taken
more
on
himself
with
the
men
he
soon
had
under
him
he
might
have
saved
france
from
much
of
her
subsequent
humiliation
or
at
least
he
might
have
preserved
the
lives
of
ney
and
of
the
brave
men
whom
the
bourbons
afterwards
butchered
outwitted
by
fouche
and
unwilling
to
face
the
hostility
of
the
chambers
davoust
at
last
consented
to
the
capitulation
of
paris
though
he
first
gave
the
prussian
cavalry
a
sharp
lesson
while
many
of
his
comrades
were
engaged
in
the
great
struggle
for
favour
or
safety
the
stern
marshal
gave
up
his
ministry
and
doing
the
last
service
in
his
power
to
france
stopped
all
further
useless
bloodshed
by
withdrawing
the
army
no
easy
task
in
their
then
humour
behind
the
loire
where
he
kept
what
the
royalists
called
the
brigands
of
the
loire
in
subjection
till
relieved
by
macdonald
he
was
the
only
one
of
the
younger
marshals
who
had
not
been
tried
in
spain
and
so
far
he
was
fortunate
but
though
he
was
not
popular
with
the
army
his
character
and
services
seem
to
point
him
out
as
the
most
fit
of
all
the
marshals
for
an
independent
command
had
napoleon
been
successful
in
davoust
was
to
have
received
the
viceroyalty
of
poland
and
he
would
probably
have
left
a
higher
name
in
history
than
the
other
men
placed
by
napoleon
to
rule
over
his
outlying
kingdoms
in
any
case
it
was
fortunate
for
france
and
for
the
allies
that
a
man
of
his
character
ruled
the
army
after
napoleon
abdicated
there
would
otherwise
have
been
wild
work
round
paris
as
it
was
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
and
by
the
force
of
his
authority
and
example
that
davoust
succeeded
in
getting
the
army
to
withdraw
from
the
capital
and
to
gradually
adopt
the
white
cockade
when
superseded
by
macdonald
he
had
done
a
work
no
other
man
could
have
accomplished
he
protested
against
the
proscription
but
it
was
too
late
his
power
had
departed
in
he
was
forgiven
for
his
services
to
france
and
was
made
a
peer
but
he
died
in
only
years
old
among
the
marshals
who
gave
an
active
support
to
napoleon
ney
takes
the
leading
part
in
most
eyes
if
it
were
only
for
his
fate
which
is
too
well
known
for
much
to
be
said
here
concerning
it
in
ney
was
commanding
in
and
was
called
up
to
paris
and
ordered
to
go
to
besancon
to
march
so
as
to
take
napoleon
in
flank
he
started
off
not
improbably
using
the
rough
brags
afterwards
attributed
to
him
as
most
grievous
sins
such
as
that
he
would
bring
back
napoleon
in
an
iron
cage
it
had
been
intended
to
have
sent
the
due
de
berry
the
second
son
of
the
comte
with
ney
and
it
was
most
unfortunate
for
the
marshal
that
this
was
not
done
there
can
be
no
possible
doubt
that
ney
spoke
and
acted
in
good
faith
when
he
left
paris
one
point
alone
seems
decisive
of
this
ney
found
under
him
in
command
as
general
of
division
bourmont
an
officer
of
royalist
opinions
who
had
at
one
time
served
with
the
vendean
insurgents
and
who
afterwards
deserted
napoleon
just
before
waterloo
although
he
had
entreated
to
be
employed
in
the
campaign
not
only
did
ney
leave
bourmont
in
command
but
requiring
another
divisional
general
instead
of
selecting
a
bonapartist
he
urged
lecourbe
to
leave
his
retirement
and
join
him
now
though
lecourbe
was
a
distinguished
general
specially
famed
for
mountain
warfare
witness
his
services
in
among
the
alps
above
lucerne
he
had
been
long
left
unemployed
by
napoleon
on
account
of
his
strong
republican
opinions
and
his
sympathy
with
moreau
these
two
generals
bourmont
and
lecourbe
the
two
arms
of
ney
as
commander
through
whom
alone
he
could
communicate
with
the
troops
he
not
only
kept
with
him
but
consulted
to
the
last
before
he
declared
for
napoleon
this
would
have
been
too
dangerous
a
thing
for
a
tricky
politician
to
have
attempted
as
a
blind
but
ney
was
well
known
to
be
only
too
frank
and
impulsive
had
the
due
de
berry
gone
with
him
had
ney
carried
with
him
such
a
gage
of
the
intention
of
the
bourbons
to
defend
their
throne
it
is
probable
that
he
would
have
behaved
like
macdonald
and
it
is
certain
that
he
would
have
had
no
better
success
the
bonapartists
themselves
dreaded
what
they
called
the
of
ney
it
was
however
thought
better
to
keep
the
due
de
berry
in
safety
ney
found
himself
put
forward
singly
as
it
were
to
oppose
the
man
whom
all
france
was
joining
he
found
as
did
every
officer
sent
on
a
similar
mission
that
the
soldiers
were
simply
waiting
to
meet
napoleon
and
while
the
princes
sought
security
while
the
soldiers
plotted
against
their
leaders
came
the
calls
of
the
emperor
in
the
old
trumpet
tone
the
eagle
was
to
fly
nay
it
was
flying
from
tower
to
tower
and
victory
was
advancing
with
a
rush
was
ney
to
be
the
one
man
to
shoot
down
his
old
leader
could
he
as
he
asked
stop
the
sea
with
his
hands
on
his
trial
his
subordinate
bourmont
who
had
by
that
time
shown
his
devotion
to
the
bourbons
by
sacrificing
his
military
honour
and
deserting
to
the
allies
was
asked
whether
ney
could
have
got
the
soldiers
to
act
against
the
emperor
he
could
only
suggest
that
if
ney
had
taken
a
musket
and
himself
charged
the
men
would
have
followed
his
example
still
said
bourmont
i
would
not
dare
to
affirm
that
he
the
marshal
would
have
won
and
who
was
ney
to
charge
we
know
how
napoleon
approached
the
forces
sent
to
oppose
him
he
showed
himself
alone
in
the
front
of
his
own
troops
was
ney
to
deliberately
kill
his
old
commander
was
any
general
ever
expected
to
undergo
such
a
test
and
can
it
be
believed
that
the
soldiers
who
carried
off
the
reluctant
oudinot
and
chased
the
flying
macdonald
had
such
a
reverence
for
the
rougeot
as
they
called
him
that
they
would
have
stood
by
while
he
committed
this
murder
the
whole
idea
is
absurd
as
ney
himself
said
at
his
trial
they
would
have
pulverized
him
undoubtedly
the
honourable
course
for
ney
would
have
been
to
have
left
his
corps
when
he
lost
control
over
them
but
to
urge
as
was
done
afterwards
that
he
had
acted
on
a
preconceived
scheme
and
that
his
example
had
such
weight
was
only
malicious
falsehood
the
emperor
himself
knew
well
how
little
he
owed
to
the
free
will
of
his
marshal
and
he
soon
had
to
send
him
from
paris
as
ney
sore
at
heart
and
discontented
with
himself
and
with
both
sides
uttered
his
mind
with
his
usual
freedom
ney
was
first
ordered
to
inspect
the
frontier
from
dunkirk
to
bale
and
was
then
allowed
to
go
to
his
home
he
kept
so
aloof
from
napoleon
that
when
he
appeared
on
the
champ
de
mai
the
emperor
affected
surprise
saying
that
he
thought
ney
had
emigrated
at
the
last
moment
marshal
mortier
fell
ney
had
already
been
sent
for
he
hurried
up
buying
mortier
horses
presumably
the
animals
who
died
under
him
at
waterloo
and
reached
the
army
just
in
time
to
be
given
the
command
of
the
left
wing
it
has
been
well
remarked
that
the
very
qualities
which
made
ney
invaluable
for
defence
or
for
the
service
of
a
weighed
against
him
in
such
a
combat
as
quatre
bras
splendid
as
a
corps
leader
he
had
not
the
commander
eye
to
embrace
the
field
and
surmise
the
strength
of
the
enemy
at
a
glance
at
bautzen
in
his
staff
had
been
unable
to
prevent
him
from
leaving
the
route
which
would
have
brought
him
on
the
very
rear
of
the
enemy
because
seeing
the
foe
and
unable
to
resist
the
desire
of
returning
their
fire
he
turned
off
to
engage
immediately
at
quatre
bras
not
seeing
the
force
he
was
engaged
with
believing
he
had
the
whole
english
army
on
his
hands
from
the
first
he
let
himself
at
the
beginning
of
the
day
be
imposed
upon
by
a
mere
screen
of
troops
we
can
not
here
go
into
ney
behaviour
at
waterloo
except
to
point
out
that
too
little
importance
is
generally
given
to
the
fact
of
the
english
cavalry
having
in
a
happy
moment
fallen
on
and
destroyed
the
artillery
which
was
being
brought
up
to
sweep
the
english
squares
at
close
quarters
at
waterloo
as
in
so
many
other
combats
the
account
of
behaviour
more
resembles
that
of
a
homeric
hero
than
of
a
modern
general
to
the
ideal
commander
of
watching
the
fight
at
a
distance
calmly
weighing
its
course
undisturbed
except
by
distant
random
shots
it
is
strange
to
compare
ney
staggering
through
the
gate
of
konigsberg
all
covered
with
blood
smoke
and
snow
musket
in
hand
announcing
himself
as
the
of
france
or
appearing
a
second
achilles
on
the
ramparts
of
smolensko
to
encourage
the
yielding
troops
on
the
glacis
or
amidst
the
flying
troops
at
waterloo
with
uncovered
head
and
broken
sword
black
with
powder
on
foot
his
fifth
horse
killed
under
him
knowing
that
life
honour
and
country
were
lost
still
hoping
against
hope
and
attempting
one
more
last
desperate
rally
if
he
had
died
ah
if
he
had
died
there
what
a
glorious
tomb
might
have
risen
glorious
for
france
as
well
as
for
him
with
the
simple
inscription
the
bravest
of
the
brave
early
on
the
june
a
small
band
of
officers
retreating
from
the
field
found
ney
asleep
at
marchiennes
the
first
repose
he
had
had
for
four
days
and
they
did
not
disturb
him
for
orders
and
indeed
what
order
could
marshal
ney
have
given
the
disaster
of
the
day
the
overwhelming
horror
of
the
flight
of
the
beaten
army
simply
crushed
ney
morally
as
well
as
physically
rising
in
the
chambers
he
denounced
all
attempt
at
further
resistance
he
did
not
know
he
would
not
believe
that
grouchy
was
safe
and
that
the
army
was
fast
rallying
fresh
from
the
field
with
all
its
traces
on
him
the
authority
of
ney
was
too
great
for
the
government
frightened
friends
plotting
royalists
echoed
the
wild
words
of
ney
brave
only
against
physical
dangers
instead
of
dying
on
the
he
had
lived
to
ensure
the
return
of
the
bourbons
the
fall
of
bonaparte
his
own
death
and
the
ruin
of
france
before
his
exception
from
the
amnesty
was
known
ney
left
paris
on
the
of
july
and
went
into
the
country
with
but
little
attempt
at
concealment
and
with
formal
passports
from
fouche
the
capitulation
of
paris
seemed
to
cover
him
and
he
was
so
little
aware
of
the
thirst
of
the
royalists
for
his
blood
that
he
let
his
presence
be
known
by
leaving
about
a
splendid
sabre
presented
to
him
by
the
emperor
on
his
marriage
and
recognised
by
mere
report
by
an
old
soldier
as
belonging
to
ney
or
murat
and
ney
himself
let
into
the
house
the
party
sent
to
arrest
him
on
the
of
august
and
actually
refused
the
offer
of
excelmans
through
whose
troops
he
passed
to
set
him
free
no
one
at
the
time
except
the
wretched
refugees
of
ghent
could
have
suspected
after
the
capitulation
that
there
was
any
special
danger
for
ney
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
see
on
what
principle
the
bourbons
chose
their
victims
or
intended
victims
drouot
for
example
had
never
served
louis
he
had
never
worn
the
white
cockade
he
had
left
france
with
napoleon
for
elba
and
had
served
the
emperor
there
in
he
had
fought
under
his
own
sovereign
after
waterloo
he
had
exerted
all
his
great
influence
the
greater
from
his
position
to
induce
the
guard
to
retire
behind
the
loire
and
to
submit
to
the
bourbons
it
was
because
davoust
so
needed
him
that
drouot
remained
with
the
army
stilt
drouot
was
selected
for
death
but
the
evidence
of
his
position
was
too
strong
to
enable
the
court
to
condemn
him
cambronne
another
selection
had
also
gone
with
napoleon
to
elba
savory
another
selection
had
as
was
eventually
acknowledged
only
joined
napoleon
when
he
was
in
full
possession
of
the
reins
of
government
bertrend
who
was
condemned
while
at
helena
was
in
the
same
position
as
drouot
in
fact
if
any
one
were
to
draw
up
a
list
of
probable
proscriptions
and
compare
it
with
those
of
the
of
july
there
would
probably
be
few
names
common
to
both
except
labedoyere
mouton
duvernet
etc
the
truth
is
that
the
bourbons
and
to
do
them
justice
still
more
the
rancorous
band
of
mediocrities
who
surrounded
them
thirsted
for
blood
even
they
could
feel
the
full
ignominy
of
the
flight
to
ghent
while
they
had
been
chanting
the
glories
of
the
restoration
the
devotion
of
the
people
the
valour
of
the
princes
napoleon
had
landed
the
restoration
had
vanished
like
a
bad
dream
and
the
princes
were
the
first
to
lead
the
way
to
the
frontier
to
protest
that
there
had
been
a
conspiracy
and
that
the
conspirators
must
suffer
was
the
only
possible
cloak
for
the
shame
of
the
royalists
who
could
not
see
that
the
only
conspiracy
was
the
universal
one
of
the
nation
against
the
miserable
men
who
knew
not
how
to
govern
a
people
ney
arrested
on
the
of
august
was
first
brought
before
a
military
court
on
the
of
november
composed
of
marshal
jourdan
president
marshals
massena
augereau
and
mortier
gazan
claparede
and
vilatte
members
moncey
had
refused
to
sit
and
massena
urged
to
the
court
his
own
quarrels
with
ney
in
spain
to
get
rid
of
the
task
but
was
forced
to
remain
defended
by
both
the
berryers
ney
unfortunately
denied
the
jurisdiction
of
the
over
him
as
a
peer
in
all
probability
the
military
court
would
have
acquitted
him
too
glad
at
the
moment
to
be
free
from
the
trial
of
their
old
comrade
not
understanding
the
danger
of
the
proceeding
the
court
by
a
majority
of
five
against
two
declared
themselves
and
on
the
of
november
ney
was
sent
before
the
chamber
of
peers
which
condemned
him
on
the
of
december
to
beg
the
life
of
his
brave
adversary
would
have
been
such
an
obvious
act
of
generosity
on
the
part
of
the
duke
of
wellington
that
we
maybe
pardoned
for
examining
his
reasons
for
not
interfering
first
the
duke
seems
to
have
laid
weight
on
the
fact
that
if
ney
had
believed
the
capitulation
had
covered
him
he
would
not
have
hidden
now
even
before
ney
knew
of
his
exception
from
the
amnesty
to
appear
in
paris
would
have
been
a
foolish
piece
of
bravado
further
the
royalist
reaction
was
in
full
vigour
and
when
the
royalist
mobs
with
the
connivance
of
the
authorities
were
murdering
marshal
brune
and
attacking
any
prominent
adherents
of
napoleon
it
was
hardly
the
time
for
ney
to
travel
in
full
pomp
it
can
not
be
said
that
apart
from
the
capitulation
the
duke
had
no
responsibility
generally
a
government
executing
a
prisoner
may
with
some
force
if
rather
brutally
urge
that
the
fact
of
their
being
able
to
try
and
execute
him
in
itself
shows
their
authority
to
do
so
the
bourbons
could
not
even
use
this
argument
if
the
allies
had
evacuated
france
louis
le
desiree
would
have
ordered
his
carriage
and
have
been
at
the
frontier
before
they
had
reached
it
if
frenchmen
actually
fired
the
shots
which
killed
ney
the
allies
at
least
shared
the
responsibility
with
the
french
government
lastly
it
would
seem
that
the
duke
would
have
asked
for
the
life
of
ney
if
the
king
clever
at
such
small
artifices
had
not
purposely
affected
a
temporary
coldness
to
him
few
men
would
have
been
so
deterred
from
asking
for
the
life
of
a
dog
the
fact
is
the
duke
of
wellington
was
a
great
general
he
was
a
hearted
and
patriotic
statesman
he
had
a
thousand
virtues
but
he
was
never
generous
it
can
not
be
said
that
he
simply
shared
the
feelings
of
his
army
for
there
was
preparation
among
some
of
his
officers
to
enable
ney
to
escape
and
ney
had
to
be
guarded
by
men
of
good
position
disguised
in
the
uniform
of
privates
ney
had
written
to
his
wife
when
he
joined
napoleon
thinking
of
the
little
vexations
the
royalists
loved
to
inflict
on
the
men
who
had
conquered
the
continent
you
will
no
longer
weep
when
you
leave
the
tuileries
the
unfortunate
lady
wept
now
as
she
vainly
sought
some
mercy
for
her
husband
arrested
on
the
of
august
sentenced
on
the
of
december
ney
was
shot
on
the
of
december
and
the
very
manner
of
his
execution
shows
that
in
taking
his
life
there
was
much
more
of
revenge
than
of
justice
if
ney
were
to
be
shot
it
is
obvious
that
it
should
have
been
as
a
high
act
of
justice
if
neither
the
rank
nor
the
services
of
the
criminal
were
to
save
him
his
death
could
not
be
too
formal
too
solemn
too
public
even
an
ordinary
military
execution
is
always
carried
out
with
grave
and
striking
forms
there
is
a
grand
parade
of
the
troops
that
all
may
see
with
their
own
eyes
the
last
act
of
the
law
after
the
execution
the
troops
defile
past
the
body
that
all
may
see
the
criminal
actually
dead
there
was
nothing
of
all
this
in
the
execution
of
ney
a
few
chance
passers
in
the
early
morning
of
the
of
december
saw
a
small
body
of
troops
waiting
by
the
wall
of
the
garden
of
the
luxemburg
a
fiacre
drove
up
out
of
which
got
marshal
ney
in
plain
clothes
himself
surprised
by
the
everyday
aspect
of
the
place
then
when
the
officer
of
the
firing
party
for
such
the
spectators
now
knew
it
to
be
saw
whom
it
was
he
was
to
fire
on
he
became
it
is
said
perfectly
petrified
and
a
peer
one
of
the
judges
of
ney
the
duke
de
la
force
took
his
place
ney
fell
at
the
first
volley
with
six
balls
in
his
breast
three
in
the
head
and
neck
and
one
in
the
arm
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
body
was
removed
plain
michel
ney
as
he
had
said
to
the
secretary
enunciating
his
title
in
reading
his
sentence
plain
michel
ney
soon
to
be
a
little
dust
the
communists
caught
in
the
streets
of
paris
in
died
with
hardly
less
formality
than
was
observed
at
the
of
the
prince
of
the
moskowa
and
duke
of
elchingen
and
the
truth
then
became
plain
the
bourbons
could
not
dared
not
attempt
to
carry
out
the
sentence
of
the
law
with
the
forms
of
the
law
the
government
did
not
venture
to
let
the
troops
or
the
people
face
the
marshal
the
forms
of
the
law
could
not
be
carried
out
the
demands
of
revenge
could
be
and
if
this
be
thought
any
exaggeration
the
proof
of
the
ill
effects
of
this
murder
for
its
form
makes
it
difficult
to
call
it
anything
else
is
ready
to
our
hands
it
was
impossible
to
get
the
public
to
believe
that
ney
had
really
been
killed
in
this
manner
and
nearly
to
this
day
we
have
had
fresh
stories
recurring
of
the
real
ney
being
discovered
in
america
the
deed
however
had
really
been
done
the
marshals
now
knew
that
when
the
princes
fled
they
themselves
must
remain
to
die
for
the
royal
cause
and
louis
had
at
last
succeeded
in
preventing
his
return
to
his
kingdom
amongst
the
baggage
waggons
of
the
allies
from
being
considered
as
a
mere
subject
for
jeers
one
detail
of
the
execution
of
ney
however
we
are
told
nothing
of
we
do
not
know
if
his
widow
like
madame
labedoyere
had
to
pay
three
francs
a
head
to
the
soldiers
of
the
firing
party
which
shot
her
husband
whatever
were
the
faults
of
the
bourbons
they
at
least
carried
out
their
executions
economically
the
statesmen
of
france
distinguished
as
they
were
certainly
did
not
rise
to
a
level
with
the
situation
either
in
or
in
in
it
is
true
they
were
almost
stunned
by
the
crash
of
the
empire
and
little
as
they
foresaw
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
still
less
could
they
have
anticipated
the
extraordinary
follies
which
were
to
be
perpetrated
in
there
was
less
excuse
for
their
helplessness
and
overawed
as
they
were
by
the
mass
of
foes
which
was
pouring
on
them
to
complete
the
disaster
of
waterloo
still
it
is
disappointing
to
find
that
there
was
no
one
to
seize
the
helm
of
power
and
confronting
the
allies
to
stipulate
proper
terms
for
france
and
for
the
brave
men
who
had
fought
for
her
the
steady
davoust
was
there
with
his
men
to
add
weight
to
their
language
and
the
total
helplessness
of
the
older
line
of
the
bourbons
had
been
too
evidently
displayed
to
make
their
return
a
certainty
so
that
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
a
patriot
might
have
saved
france
from
much
of
the
degradation
and
loss
inflicted
on
her
when
once
the
allies
had
again
got
her
at
their
mercy
least
the
bourbons
might
have
been
deprived
of
the
revenge
they
sought
for
in
taking
some
of
the
best
blood
of
france
better
for
ney
and
his
comrades
to
have
fallen
in
a
last
struggle
before
paris
than
to
be
shot
by
frenchmen
emboldened
by
the
presence
of
foreign
troops
talleyrand
the
most
prominent
figure
among
the
statesmen
was
away
his
absence
at
vienna
during
the
first
restoration
was
undoubtedly
the
cause
of
many
of
the
errors
then
committed
his
ability
as
displayed
under
napoleon
has
been
much
exaggerated
for
as
the
duke
of
wellington
said
it
was
easy
enough
to
be
foreign
minister
to
a
government
in
military
possession
of
europe
but
at
least
he
was
above
the
petty
trivialities
and
absurdities
of
the
bourbon
court
on
the
receipt
of
the
news
of
the
landing
of
napoleon
he
really
seems
to
have
believed
that
the
enterprise
would
immediately
end
in
disaster
and
he
pressed
on
the
outlawing
of
the
man
who
had
overwhelmed
him
with
riches
and
who
had
at
the
worst
left
him
when
in
disgrace
in
quiet
possession
of
all
his
wealth
but
as
the
power
of
napoleon
became
more
and
more
displayed
as
perhaps
talleyrand
found
that
the
austrians
were
not
quite
so
firm
as
they
wished
to
be
considered
and
as
he
foresaw
the
possible
chances
of
the
orleans
family
he
became
rather
lukewarm
in
his
attention
to
the
king
to
whom
he
had
recently
been
bewailing
the
hardships
of
his
separation
from
his
loved
monarch
he
suddenly
found
that
after
a
congress
the
first
duty
of
a
diplomatist
was
to
look
after
his
liver
and
carlsbad
offered
an
agreeable
retreat
where
he
could
wait
till
he
might
congratulate
the
winner
in
the
struggle
louis
deeply
resented
this
conduct
of
his
foreign
minister
and
when
talleyrand
at
last
joined
him
with
all
his
doubts
resolved
the
king
took
the
first
opportunity
of
dismissing
him
leaving
the
calm
talleyrand
for
once
stuttering
with
rage
louis
soon
however
found
that
he
was
not
the
free
agent
he
believed
the
allies
did
not
want
to
have
to
again
replace
their
puppet
on
the
throne
and
they
looked
on
talleyrand
and
fouche
as
the
two
necessary
men
talleyrand
was
reinstated
immediately
and
remained
for
some
time
at
the
head
of
the
ministry
he
was
however
not
the
man
for
parliamentary
government
being
too
careless
in
business
and
trying
to
gain
his
ends
more
by
clever
tricks
than
straightforward
measures
as
for
the
state
into
which
he
let
the
government
fall
it
was
happily
characterised
by
beugnot
until
now
said
he
we
have
only
known
three
sorts
of
governments
the
monarchical
the
aristocratic
and
the
republican
now
we
have
invented
a
new
one
which
has
never
been
heard
of
before
paternal
anarchy
in
september
the
elections
to
the
chamber
were
bringing
in
deputies
more
royalist
than
the
king
and
talleyrand
sought
to
gain
popularity
by
throwing
over
fouche
to
his
horror
it
appeared
that
well
contented
with
this
step
the
deputies
next
asked
when
the
former
bishop
was
to
be
dismissed
taking
advantage
of
what
talleyrand
conceived
to
be
a
happy
way
of
eliciting
a
strong
expression
of
royal
support
by
threatening
to
resign
the
king
replaced
him
by
the
duc
de
richelieu
it
was
well
to
cut
jokes
at
the
duke
and
say
that
he
was
the
man
in
france
who
knew
most
of
the
crimea
the
duke
had
been
long
in
the
russian
service
with
the
approval
of
napoleon
but
talleyrand
was
overwhelmed
he
received
the
same
office
at
court
which
he
had
held
under
napoleon
grand
chamberlain
and
afterwards
remained
a
sardonic
spectator
of
events
a
not
unimposing
figure
attending
at
the
court
ceremonials
and
at
the
heavy
dinners
of
the
king
and
probably
lending
a
helping
hand
in
to
oust
charles
from
the
throne
the
monarchy
of
july
sent
him
as
ambassador
to
england
where
he
mixed
in
local
politics
for
example
plotting
against
lord
palmerston
whose
brusque
manners
he
disliked
and
in
he
ended
his
strange
life
with
some
dignity
having
as
one
of
his
eulogists
puts
it
been
faithful
to
every
government
he
had
served
as
long
as
it
was
possible
to
save
them
with
the
darker
side
of
talleyrand
character
we
have
nothing
to
do
here
it
is
sufficient
for
our
purposes
to
say
that
the
part
the
leading
statesman
of
france
took
during
the
cent
tours
was
simply
nil
in
he
had
let
the
reins
slip
through
his
hands
he
could
only
follow
the
king
who
even
refused
to
adopt
his
advice
as
to
the
proper
way
in
which
to
return
to
france
and
though
he
once
more
became
chief
minister
talleyrand
like
louis
owed
his
restoration
in
solely
to
the
allies
the
comte
the
brother
of
the
king
and
later
king
himself
as
charles
was
sent
to
lyons
to
which
place
the
duc
followed
him
and
where
the
two
princes
met
marshal
macdonald
the
marshal
did
all
that
man
could
do
to
keep
the
soldiers
true
to
the
bourbons
but
he
had
to
advise
the
princes
to
return
to
paris
and
he
himself
had
to
fly
for
his
life
when
he
attempted
to
stop
napoleon
in
person
the
duc
was
then
sent
to
the
north
to
hold
lille
where
the
king
intended
to
take
refuge
and
the
comte
remained
with
the
court
the
court
was
very
badly
off
for
money
the
king
and
clarke
duke
of
feltre
the
war
minister
were
the
only
happy
possessors
of
carriages
they
passed
their
time
as
the
abbe
louis
once
bitterly
remarked
in
saying
foolish
things
till
they
had
a
chance
of
doing
them
the
comte
who
probably
wisely
certainly
cautiously
had
refused
to
go
with
de
vitrolles
to
stir
up
the
south
until
he
had
placed
the
king
in
safety
had
ended
by
going
to
ghent
too
while
the
duc
de
berry
was
at
alost
close
by
with
a
tiny
army
composed
of
the
remains
of
the
maison
du
roi
of
which
the
most
was
made
in
reports
the
duc
always
an
object
of
suspicion
to
the
king
had
left
france
with
the
royal
party
but
had
refused
to
stay
in
belgium
as
he
alleged
that
it
was
an
enemy
country
he
crossed
to
england
where
he
remained
greatly
adding
to
the
anxiety
of
louis
by
refusing
to
join
him
the
end
of
these
princes
is
well
known
louis
died
in
leaving
his
throne
to
his
brother
but
charles
only
held
it
till
when
after
the
rising
called
the
three
glorious
days
of
july
he
was
civilly
escorted
from
france
and
took
shelter
in
england
the
due
angouleme
died
without
issue
the
duc
de
berry
was
assassinated
in
but
his
widow
gave
birth
to
a
posthumous
son
the
duc
de
bordeaux
or
to
fervid
royalists
henri
though
better
known
to
us
as
the
comte
de
chambord
who
died
in
without
issue
thus
ending
the
then
eldest
line
of
bourbons
and
transmitting
his
claims
to
the
orleans
family
on
the
fall
of
charles
the
duc
became
king
of
the
french
but
he
was
unseated
by
the
revolution
of
and
died
a
refugee
in
england
as
the
three
princes
of
the
house
of
conde
the
prince
de
conde
his
son
the
duc
de
bourbon
and
his
grandson
the
due
all
died
without
further
male
issue
that
noble
line
is
extinct
when
the
news
of
the
escape
of
napoleon
from
elba
reached
vienna
on
the
of
march
the
three
heads
of
the
allies
the
emperors
of
austria
and
russia
and
the
king
of
prussia
were
still
there
though
it
was
said
that
the
congress
danced
but
did
not
advance
still
a
great
deal
of
work
had
really
been
done
and
the
news
of
napoleon
landing
created
a
fresh
bond
of
union
between
the
allies
which
stopped
all
further
chances
of
disunion
and
enabled
them
to
practically
complete
their
work
by
the
of
june
though
the
treaties
required
cobbling
for
some
years
afterwards
france
austria
and
england
had
snatched
the
greater
part
of
saxony
from
the
jaws
of
prussia
and
alexander
had
been
forced
to
leave
the
king
of
saxony
to
reign
over
half
of
his
former
subjects
without
as
he
wished
sparing
him
the
pain
of
such
a
degradation
by
taking
all
from
him
russia
had
to
be
contented
with
a
large
increase
of
her
polish
dominions
getting
most
of
the
of
westphalia
austria
had
probably
unwisely
withdrawn
from
her
former
outlying
provinces
in
swabia
and
the
netherlands
which
had
before
the
revolution
made
her
necessarily
the
guardian
of
europe
against
france
preferring
to
take
her
gains
in
italy
gains
which
she
has
gradually
lost
in
our
days
while
prussia
by
accepting
the
rhine
provinces
completely
stepped
into
the
former
post
of
austria
indeed
from
the
way
in
which
prussia
was
after
as
it
were
scattered
across
germany
it
was
evident
that
her
fate
must
be
either
to
be
crushed
by
france
or
else
by
annexing
the
states
enclosed
in
her
dominions
to
become
the
predominating
power
in
germany
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
remain
as
she
was
left
the
allies
tightly
bound
france
they
had
no
desire
to
have
again
to
march
on
paris
to
restore
louis
to
the
subjects
who
had
such
unfortunate
objections
to
being
subjected
to
that
desirable
monarch
by
the
second
treaty
of
paris
on
the
of
november
france
was
to
be
occupied
by
an
allied
force
in
military
positions
on
the
frontier
not
to
exceed
men
to
be
taken
from
all
the
allied
armies
under
a
commander
who
was
eventually
the
duke
of
wellington
originally
the
occupation
was
not
to
exceed
five
years
but
in
february
the
army
was
reduced
by
men
of
each
contingent
and
by
the
treaty
of
chapelle
of
october
france
was
evacuated
by
the
of
november
the
three
monarchs
were
probably
not
sorry
to
get
the
congress
over
on
any
terms
alexander
had
had
his
fill
of
displaying
himself
in
the
salons
in
his
favourite
part
of
an
agamemnon
generous
towards
troy
and
he
had
worn
out
his
first
popularity
he
was
stung
by
finding
some
of
his
favourite
plans
boldly
opposed
by
talleyrand
and
by
metternich
and
indeed
was
anxious
to
meet
the
last
in
open
combat
francis
had
required
all
the
firmness
of
what
he
called
his
bohemian
head
to
resist
the
threats
entreaties
and
cajoleries
employed
to
get
him
to
acquiesce
in
the
dethronement
of
the
king
of
saxony
and
the
wiping
out
of
the
saxon
nationality
by
the
very
alliance
which
professed
to
fight
only
for
the
rights
of
nations
and
of
their
lawful
sovereigns
all
three
monarchs
had
again
the
satisfaction
of
entering
paris
but
without
enjoying
the
full
glories
of
our
friends
the
enemies
were
not
so
popular
then
in
france
and
the
spoliation
of
the
louvre
was
not
pleasant
even
to
the
royalists
the
foreign
monarchs
soon
returned
to
their
own
drained
and
impoverished
states
the
emperor
francis
had
afterwards
a
quiet
reign
to
his
death
in
having
only
to
assist
his
minister
in
snuffing
out
the
occasional
flashes
of
a
love
of
freedom
in
germany
the
king
of
prussia
returned
in
a
triumph
well
won
by
his
sturdy
subjects
and
in
the
light
of
his
new
honours
the
countess
von
voss
tells
us
he
was
really
handsome
he
was
now
at
leisure
to
resume
the
discussions
on
uniform
and
the
work
of
fastening
and
unfastening
the
numerous
buttons
of
his
pantaloons
in
which
he
had
been
so
roughly
interrupted
by
jena
the
first
institution
of
the
zollverein
or
commercial
union
with
several
states
gradually
extended
was
a
measure
which
did
much
for
the
unification
of
germany
with
his
brother
sovereigns
he
revisited
paris
at
the
end
of
the
military
occupation
in
remaining
there
longer
than
the
others
because
said
the
parisians
he
had
discovered
an
actor
at
a
small
theatre
who
achieved
the
feat
of
making
him
laugh
he
died
in
his
queen
heartbroken
it
was
said
had
died
in
alexander
was
still
brimming
over
with
the
best
and
most
benevolent
intentions
towards
every
one
the
world
was
to
be
free
happy
and
religious
but
he
had
rather
vague
ideas
as
to
how
his
plans
were
to
be
carried
out
thus
it
is
characteristic
that
when
his
successor
desired
to
have
a
solemn
coronation
as
king
of
poland
it
was
found
that
alexander
had
not
foreseen
the
difficulties
which
were
met
with
in
trying
to
arrange
for
the
coronation
of
a
sovereign
of
the
greek
church
as
king
of
a
roman
catholic
state
the
but
very
misty
holy
alliance
was
one
of
the
few
fruits
of
alexander
visions
his
mind
is
described
as
passing
through
a
regular
series
of
stages
with
each
influence
under
which
he
acted
he
ended
his
life
tired
out
disillusioned
deceived
in
everything
weighed
down
with
regret
obliged
to
crush
the
very
hopes
of
his
people
he
had
encouraged
dying
in
at
taganrog
leaving
his
new
polish
kingdom
to
be
wiped
out
successors
the
minor
sovereigns
require
little
mention
they
retained
any
titles
they
had
received
from
napoleon
while
they
exulted
at
being
free
from
his
heavy
hand
and
sharp
superintendence
each
got
a
share
small
or
great
of
the
spoil
except
the
poor
king
of
denmark
who
being
assured
by
alexander
on
his
departure
that
he
carried
away
all
hearts
answered
yes
but
not
any
souls
the
reintroduction
of
much
that
was
bad
in
the
old
system
one
country
even
going
so
far
as
to
torture
the
steady
attack
on
liberty
and
on
all
liberal
ideas
wurtemberg
being
practically
the
only
state
which
grumbled
at
the
tightening
of
the
reins
so
dear
to
metternich
all
formed
a
fitting
commentary
on
the
proclamations
by
which
the
sovereigns
had
hounded
on
their
people
against
the
man
they
represented
as
the
one
obstacle
to
the
freedom
and
peace
of
europe
in
gloom
and
disenchantment
the
nations
sat
down
to
lick
their
wounds
the
contempt
shown
by
the
monarchs
for
everything
but
the
right
of
conquest
the
manner
in
which
they
treated
the
lands
won
from
napoleon
as
a
gigantic
pool
which
was
to
be
shared
amongst
them
so
many
souls
to
each
their
total
failure
to
fulfil
their
promises
to
their
subjects
of
granting
liberty
all
these
slowly
bore
their
fruits
in
after
years
and
their
effects
are
not
even
yet
exhausted
the
right
of
a
sovereign
to
hold
his
lands
was
now
by
the
public
law
of
europe
to
be
decided
by
his
strength
the
rights
of
the
people
were
treated
as
not
existing
truly
as
our
most
gifted
poetess
has
sung
the
kings
crept
out
the
peoples
sat
at
home
and
finding
the
long
invocated
peace
a
pall
embroidered
with
worn
images
of
rights
divine
too
scant
to
cover
doom
such
as
they
