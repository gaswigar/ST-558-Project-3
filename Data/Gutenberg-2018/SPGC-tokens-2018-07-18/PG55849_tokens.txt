lane
the
bodley
head
preface
conspicuous
among
the
writings
which
influenced
the
great
changes
witnessed
by
the
world
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
were
the
héloise
the
social
the
ou
of
rousseau
at
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
the
advent
of
the
twentieth
century
one
finds
three
books
and
the
works
of
émile
zola
rousseau
foremost
descendant
it
is
too
soon
by
far
to
attempt
to
gauge
the
extent
of
the
influence
which
these
works
may
exercise
but
disseminated
in
french
and
in
many
other
languages
to
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
earth
they
are
works
which
will
certainly
have
to
be
reckoned
with
in
a
social
as
well
as
a
literary
sense
the
writings
of
rousseau
violently
assailed
by
some
enthusiastically
praised
by
others
ended
by
leaving
their
mark
on
the
world
at
large
very
few
may
read
them
nowadays
but
in
certain
essential
respects
their
spirit
pervaded
the
nineteenth
century
and
their
influence
is
not
dead
yet
for
the
influence
which
springs
from
the
eternal
truths
of
nature
can
not
die
as
for
the
critics
who
will
undoubtedly
arise
to
dispute
the
likelihood
of
any
great
influence
being
exercised
by
the
last
writings
of
émile
zola
i
adjourn
them
to
some
twenty
years
hence
rome
was
not
built
in
a
day
many
long
years
elapsed
before
the
spirit
of
rousseau
writings
became
fully
disseminated
and
although
the
world
moves
more
quickly
now
than
it
did
then
time
remains
a
factor
of
the
greatest
importance
moreover
the
future
alone
can
decide
the
fate
of
émile
zola
last
books
for
while
dealing
with
problems
of
the
present
time
they
are
essentially
books
which
appeal
to
the
future
for
their
justification
each
of
those
three
volumes
and
takes
as
its
text
an
existing
state
of
things
and
then
suggests
alterations
and
remedies
which
can
only
be
applied
gradually
long
years
being
required
to
bring
about
any
substantial
result
it
is
known
that
the
series
was
to
have
comprised
a
fourth
and
concluding
volume
which
would
have
been
entitled
and
indeed
the
actual
writing
of
that
volume
would
have
been
begun
on
september
last
if
at
an
early
hour
on
that
very
day
the
hand
of
émile
zola
had
not
been
stayed
for
ever
by
a
tragic
death
which
a
few
precautions
would
undoubtedly
have
prevented
at
an
earlier
stage
it
was
surmised
on
many
sides
i
see
by
the
newspaper
cuttings
before
me
that
this
unwritten
book
would
deal
chiefly
with
the
dreyfus
case
in
which
zola
played
so
commanding
and
a
part
but
that
was
a
mistake
a
misconception
of
his
intentions
though
his
work
would
have
embraced
the
justice
dispensed
in
courts
of
law
his
chief
thought
was
social
justice
equity
as
between
class
and
class
man
and
man
and
thus
the
hand
of
death
at
least
robbed
those
who
are
in
any
way
oppressed
of
a
powerful
statement
of
their
rights
as
for
the
dreyfus
case
it
figures
in
the
present
volume
or
rather
it
serves
as
the
basis
of
one
of
the
narratives
unfolded
in
it
the
dreyfus
case
certainly
revealed
injustice
but
it
even
more
particularly
revealed
falsehood
the
most
unblushing
and
the
most
egregious
mendacity
the
elevation
of
the
and
the
to
the
dignity
of
a
fine
art
the
world
has
known
greater
deeds
of
injustice
than
the
dreyfus
case
but
never
has
it
known
and
may
it
never
again
know
such
a
widespread
exhibition
of
mendacity
both
so
unscrupulous
and
so
persevering
attended
too
by
the
most
amazing
credulity
on
the
part
of
of
the
french
nation
for
small
indeed
at
the
beginning
at
all
events
was
the
heroic
band
which
championed
the
truth
behind
all
the
mendacity
and
credulity
beyond
the
personages
directly
implicated
in
the
case
stood
one
of
the
great
forces
of
the
world
the
roman
catholic
church
of
all
the
ministers
of
that
church
in
france
only
one
raised
his
voice
in
favour
of
the
truth
all
the
others
were
tacitly
or
actively
accomplices
in
the
great
iniquity
and
that
will
explain
much
which
will
be
found
in
émile
zola
last
book
the
horrible
crime
on
which
he
bases
a
part
of
his
narrative
is
not
ascribed
to
any
military
man
in
fact
the
army
scarcely
figures
in
it
is
one
of
the
crimes
springing
from
the
unnatural
lives
led
by
those
who
have
taken
vows
in
the
roman
church
of
which
some
record
will
be
found
in
the
reports
on
criminality
in
france
which
the
keeper
of
the
seals
issues
every
ten
years
many
such
crimes
particularly
those
which
are
not
carried
to
the
point
of
murder
are
more
or
less
hushed
up
the
offenders
being
helped
to
escape
by
their
friends
in
the
church
but
sufficient
cases
have
been
legally
investigated
during
the
last
thirty
years
to
enable
one
to
say
that
the
crime
set
forth
in
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
altogether
exceptional
in
its
nature
the
scene
of
the
book
is
laid
in
the
french
school
world
and
by
the
intriguing
of
clericalist
teachers
the
crime
referred
to
is
imputed
to
a
jew
schoolmaster
forthwith
there
comes
an
explosion
of
that
cruelly
and
cowardly
spurred
on
by
the
roman
church
which
was
the
very
et
of
the
dreyfus
case
on
the
dogmas
of
the
roman
church
and
on
her
teaching
methods
with
the
young
falls
the
entire
responsibility
of
such
fanaticism
and
such
credulity
republican
france
fully
enlightened
respecting
the
church
aims
by
many
circumstances
and
occurrences
the
dreyfus
case
the
treasonable
monarchical
spirit
shown
by
her
officers
when
educated
in
jesuit
colleges
the
whole
nationalist
agitation
and
the
very
educational
exhibits
sent
by
the
religious
orders
to
the
last
great
in
paris
exhibits
which
proved
peremptorily
that
children
were
being
reared
by
brothers
and
sisters
in
hatred
and
contempt
of
the
government
of
the
country
france
is
now
driving
the
church
from
both
the
elementary
and
the
superior
schools
those
who
merely
glance
with
indifference
at
the
paris
letters
and
telegrams
appearing
in
the
newspapers
may
be
told
that
a
great
revolution
is
now
taking
place
in
france
a
revolution
partaking
of
some
of
the
features
of
the
reformation
a
change
such
as
england
for
instance
has
not
witnessed
since
henry
viii
and
james
ii
the
effects
of
that
change
upon
the
world
at
large
may
be
tremendous
rome
knows
it
and
resists
with
the
tenacity
of
despair
but
faith
in
her
dogmas
and
belief
in
her
protestations
have
departed
from
the
great
majority
of
the
french
electorate
and
driven
from
the
schools
unable
in
particular
to
continue
moulding
the
women
by
whom
hitherto
she
has
so
largely
exercised
her
influence
the
church
already
finds
herself
in
sore
straits
at
a
loss
almost
how
to
proceed
by
hook
or
crook
she
will
resist
undoubtedly
to
the
last
gasp
but
with
the
secularisation
of
the
whole
educational
system
it
will
be
difficult
for
her
to
recruit
adherents
in
the
future
and
poison
the
national
life
as
she
did
poison
it
throughout
the
years
of
the
dreyfus
unrest
she
sowed
the
storm
and
now
she
is
reaping
the
whirlwind
besides
the
powerful
of
a
crime
which
is
unfolded
in
the
pages
of
besides
the
discussion
of
political
and
religious
methods
and
prospects
and
the
exposition
of
educational
views
which
will
be
found
in
the
book
it
has
other
very
interesting
features
the
whole
story
of
marc
froment
and
his
struggle
with
his
wife
geneviève
is
admirable
it
has
appealed
to
me
intensely
for
personal
reasons
though
happily
my
home
never
knew
so
fierce
a
conflict
yet
experience
has
taught
me
what
may
happen
when
man
and
woman
do
not
share
the
same
faith
and
how
over
the
most
passionate
love
the
sincerest
affection
there
may
for
that
reason
fall
a
blighting
shadow
difficult
indeed
to
dispel
and
though
marc
froment
at
last
found
his
remedy
as
i
found
mine
living
to
enjoy
long
of
perfect
agreement
with
the
chosen
helpmate
it
is
certain
that
a
difference
of
religious
belief
is
a
most
serious
danger
for
all
who
enter
the
married
state
and
that
it
leads
to
the
greatest
misery
the
absolute
wrecking
of
many
homes
in
the
subject
is
treated
with
admirable
insight
force
and
pathos
and
i
feel
confident
that
this
portion
of
the
book
will
be
read
with
the
keenest
interest
of
the
rest
of
the
work
i
need
hardly
speak
further
for
i
should
merely
be
paraphrasing
things
which
will
be
found
in
it
some
of
the
personages
who
figure
in
its
pages
will
doubtless
be
recognised
nobody
acquainted
with
the
dreyfus
case
can
doubt
i
think
the
identity
of
the
scoundrel
who
served
as
the
basis
of
brother
gorgias
father
crabot
also
is
a
celebrity
and
simon
david
delbos
and
baron
nathan
are
drawn
from
life
there
are
several
striking
scenes
the
discovery
of
the
crime
the
arrest
and
the
first
trial
of
the
jew
schoolmaster
the
parting
of
marc
from
his
wife
and
subsequently
from
his
daughter
louise
the
deaths
of
madame
berthereau
and
madame
duparque
and
the
last
public
appearance
of
the
impudent
gorgias
but
amid
all
the
matter
woven
into
the
narrative
one
never
loses
sight
of
the
chief
theme
the
ignominy
and
even
the
futility
of
falsehood
the
debasing
effects
of
credulity
and
ignorance
the
health
and
power
that
come
from
knowledge
this
being
the
to
truth
which
ends
by
triumphing
over
all
things
let
me
add
that
the
book
is
the
longest
as
well
as
the
last
of
my
dear
master
writings
while
translating
it
i
have
pruned
it
slightly
here
and
there
in
order
to
get
rid
of
sundry
repetitions
in
so
long
a
work
some
repetition
is
perhaps
necessary
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
with
émile
zola
repetition
was
more
or
less
a
method
one
blow
seldom
if
ever
sufficed
him
he
was
bent
on
hammering
his
points
into
his
reader
skull
with
the
last
part
of
i
have
had
some
little
difficulty
the
proofs
from
which
my
translation
has
been
made
containing
some
scarcely
intelligible
passages
as
well
as
various
errors
in
names
and
facts
which
i
have
rectified
as
best
i
could
these
however
are
matters
of
little
moment
and
can
hardly
affect
the
work
as
a
whole
though
of
course
it
is
unfortunate
that
zola
should
not
have
been
spared
to
correct
his
last
proofs
and
now
as
this
is
in
all
likelihood
the
last
occasion
on
which
i
shall
be
privileged
to
present
one
of
his
works
in
an
english
dress
may
i
tender
to
all
whom
my
translations
have
reached
the
hundreds
of
reviewers
and
the
many
thousands
of
readers
in
the
lands
where
the
english
language
is
spoken
my
heartfelt
thanks
for
the
courtesy
the
leniency
the
patience
the
encouragement
the
favour
they
have
shown
to
me
for
several
years
as
i
said
in
a
previous
preface
i
am
conscious
of
many
imperfections
in
these
renderings
of
mine
i
can
only
regret
that
they
should
not
have
been
better
but
like
others
i
have
my
limitations
at
the
same
time
i
may
say
that
i
have
never
undertaken
any
of
these
translations
in
a
perfunctory
or
a
mere
mercantile
spirit
such
as
they
are
they
have
been
to
me
essentially
a
labour
of
love
and
now
that
i
am
about
to
lay
down
my
pen
that
i
see
a
whole
period
of
my
life
closing
i
think
it
only
right
to
express
my
gratitude
to
all
whose
support
has
helped
me
to
accomplish
my
task
of
placing
the
great
bulk
of
émile
zola
writings
within
the
reach
of
those
who
unfortunately
are
unable
to
read
french
my
good
friend
once
remarked
that
it
was
a
great
honour
and
privilege
to
be
if
only
for
one
single
hour
the
spokesman
of
one
generation
i
feel
that
the
great
honour
and
privilege
of
my
life
will
consist
in
having
been
imperfectly
no
doubt
yet
not
i
hope
without
some
fidelity
his
spokesman
for
ten
years
among
many

on
the
previous
evening
that
of
wednesday
marc
froment
the
jonville
schoolmaster
with
geneviève
his
wife
and
louise
his
little
girl
had
arrived
at
maillebois
where
he
was
in
the
habit
of
spending
a
month
of
his
vacation
in
the
company
of
his
wife
grandmother
and
mother
madame
duparque
and
madame
berthereau
ladies
as
folk
called
them
in
the
district
maillebois
which
counted
two
thousand
inhabitants
and
ranked
as
the
chief
place
of
a
canton
was
only
six
miles
distant
from
the
village
of
jonville
and
less
than
four
from
beaumont
the
large
old
university
town
the
first
days
of
august
were
oppressively
hot
that
year
there
had
been
a
frightful
storm
on
the
previous
sunday
during
the
distribution
of
prizes
and
again
that
night
about
two
a
deluge
of
rain
had
fallen
without
however
clearing
the
sky
which
remained
cloudy
lowering
and
oppressively
heavy
the
ladies
who
had
risen
at
six
in
order
to
be
ready
for
seven
mass
were
already
in
their
little
awaiting
the
younger
folk
who
evinced
no
alacrity
to
come
down
four
cups
were
set
out
on
the
white
oilcloth
and
at
last
pélagie
appeared
with
the
small
of
build
and
with
a
large
nose
and
thin
lips
she
had
been
twenty
years
in
madame
duparque
service
and
was
accustomed
to
speak
her
mind
well
said
she
coffee
will
be
quite
cold
but
it
will
not
be
my
fault
when
she
had
returned
grumbling
to
her
kitchen
madame
duparque
also
vented
her
displeasure
is
unbearable
she
said
might
think
that
marc
took
pleasure
in
making
us
late
for
mass
whenever
he
stays
here
madame
berthereau
who
was
more
indulgent
ventured
to
suggest
an
excuse
storm
must
have
prevented
them
from
sleeping
she
replied
i
heard
them
hastening
overhead
just
now
three
and
sixty
years
of
age
very
tall
with
hair
still
very
dark
and
a
frigid
symmetrically
wrinkled
face
severe
eyes
and
a
domineering
nose
madame
duparque
had
long
kept
a
draper
shop
known
by
the
sign
of
guardian
angel
on
the
place
maxence
in
front
of
the
cathedral
of
beaumont
but
after
the
sudden
death
of
her
husband
caused
it
was
said
by
the
collapse
of
a
catholic
she
had
sensibly
disposed
of
the
business
and
retired
with
an
income
of
some
six
thousand
francs
a
year
to
maillebois
where
she
owned
a
little
house
this
had
taken
place
about
twelve
years
previously
and
her
daughter
madame
berthereau
being
also
left
a
widow
had
joined
her
with
her
daughter
geneviève
who
was
then
entering
her
eleventh
year
to
madame
duparque
the
sudden
death
of
her
a
state
revenue
in
whose
future
she
had
foolishly
believed
but
who
died
poor
leaving
his
wife
and
child
on
her
hands
proved
another
bitter
blow
since
that
time
the
two
widows
had
resided
together
in
the
dismal
little
house
at
maillebois
leading
a
confined
almost
claustral
life
limited
in
an
increasing
degree
by
the
most
rigid
religious
practices
nevertheless
madame
berthereau
who
had
been
fondly
adored
by
her
husband
retained
as
a
memento
of
that
awakening
to
love
and
life
an
affectionate
gentleness
of
manner
tall
and
dark
like
her
mother
she
had
a
sorrowful
worn
and
faded
countenance
with
submissive
eyes
and
tired
lips
on
which
occasionally
appeared
her
secret
despair
at
the
thought
of
the
happiness
she
had
lost
it
was
by
one
of
berthereau
friends
salvan
who
after
being
a
schoolmaster
at
beaumont
became
an
inspector
of
elementary
schools
and
subsequently
director
of
the
training
college
that
the
marriage
of
marc
and
geneviève
was
brought
about
he
was
the
berthereau
a
man
did
not
follow
the
observances
of
the
church
but
he
allowed
his
wife
to
do
so
and
with
affectionate
weakness
he
had
even
ended
by
accompanying
her
to
mass
in
a
similarly
affectionate
way
salvan
whose
freedom
of
thought
was
yet
greater
than
his
friend
for
he
relied
exclusively
on
experimental
certainty
was
imprudent
enough
to
foist
marc
into
a
pious
family
without
troubling
himself
about
any
possibility
of
conflict
the
young
people
were
very
fond
of
each
other
and
in
salvan
opinion
they
would
assuredly
arrange
matters
between
them
indeed
during
her
three
years
of
married
life
geneviève
who
had
been
one
of
the
best
pupils
of
the
convent
of
the
visitation
at
beaumont
had
gradually
neglected
her
religious
observances
absorbed
as
she
was
in
her
love
for
her
husband
at
this
madame
duparque
evinced
deep
affliction
although
the
young
woman
in
her
desire
to
please
her
made
it
a
duty
to
follow
her
to
church
whenever
she
stayed
at
maillebois
but
this
was
not
sufficient
for
the
terrible
old
grandmother
who
in
the
first
instance
had
tried
to
prevent
the
marriage
and
who
now
harboured
a
feeling
of
dark
rancour
against
marc
accusing
him
of
robbing
her
of
her
grandchild
soul
quarter
to
seven
she
muttered
as
she
heard
the
neighbouring
church
clock
strike
shall
never
be
ready
then
approaching
the
window
she
glanced
at
the
adjacent
place
des
capucins
the
little
house
was
built
at
a
corner
of
that
square
and
the
rue
de
on
its
ground
floor
to
the
right
and
the
left
of
the
central
passage
were
the
dining
and
drawing
rooms
and
in
the
rear
came
the
kitchen
and
the
scullery
which
looked
into
a
dark
and
mouldy
yard
then
on
the
first
floor
on
the
right
hand
were
two
rooms
set
apart
for
madame
duparque
and
on
the
left
two
others
occupied
by
madame
berthereau
whilst
under
the
tiles
in
front
of
and
some
store
places
were
two
more
little
rooms
which
had
been
furnished
for
geneviève
during
her
girlhood
and
of
which
she
gaily
resumed
possession
whenever
she
now
came
to
maillebois
with
her
husband
but
how
dark
was
the
gloom
how
heavy
the
silence
how
tomblike
the
chill
which
fell
from
the
dim
ceilings
the
rue
de
starting
from
the
apse
of
the
parish
church
of
martin
was
too
narrow
for
vehicular
traffic
twilight
reigned
there
even
at
noontide
the
were
leprous
the
little
were
mossy
the
atmosphere
stank
of
slops
and
on
the
northern
side
the
place
des
capucins
spread
out
treeless
but
darkened
by
the
lofty
front
of
an
old
convent
which
had
been
divided
between
the
capuchins
who
there
had
a
large
and
handsome
chapel
and
the
brothers
of
the
christian
schools
who
had
installed
a
very
prosperous
educational
establishment
in
some
of
the
conventual
dependencies
madame
duparque
remained
for
a
moment
in
contemplation
of
that
deserted
space
across
which
flitted
merely
the
shadowy
figures
of
the
devout
its
priestly
quietude
being
enlivened
at
intervals
only
by
the
children
attending
the
brothers
school
a
bell
rang
slowly
in
the
lifeless
air
and
the
old
lady
was
turning
round
impatiently
when
the
door
of
the
room
opened
and
geneviève
came
in
last
the
grandmother
exclaimed
must
breakfast
quickly
the
first
bell
is
ringing
fair
tall
and
slender
with
splendid
hair
and
a
face
all
life
and
gaiety
inherited
from
her
father
geneviève
childlike
still
though
two
and
twenty
was
laughing
with
a
laugh
which
showed
all
her
white
teeth
but
madame
duparque
on
perceiving
that
she
was
alone
began
to
protest
is
not
marc
ready
following
me
grandmother
he
is
coming
down
with
louise
then
after
kissing
her
silent
mother
geneviève
gave
expression
to
the
amusement
she
felt
at
finding
herself
once
more
as
a
married
woman
in
the
quiet
home
of
her
youth
ah
she
knew
each
of
that
place
des
capucins
she
found
old
friends
in
the
smallest
tufts
of
weeds
and
by
way
of
evincing
amiability
and
gaining
time
she
was
going
into
raptures
over
the
scene
she
viewed
from
the
window
when
all
at
once
on
seeing
two
black
figures
pass
she
recognised
them
there
are
father
philibin
and
brother
fulgence
she
said
can
they
be
going
at
this
early
hour
the
two
clerics
were
slowly
crossing
the
little
square
which
under
the
lowering
sky
the
shadows
of
their
cassocks
seemed
to
fill
father
philibin
forty
years
of
age
and
of
peasant
origin
displayed
square
shoulders
and
a
course
round
freckled
face
with
big
eyes
a
large
mouth
and
strong
jaws
he
was
prefect
of
the
studies
at
the
college
of
valmarie
a
magnificent
property
which
the
jesuits
owned
in
the
environs
of
maillebois
brother
fulgence
likewise
a
man
of
forty
but
little
dark
and
lean
was
the
superior
of
the
three
brothers
with
whom
he
carried
on
the
neighbouring
christian
school
the
son
of
a
servant
girl
and
a
mad
doctor
who
had
died
a
patient
in
a
madhouse
he
was
of
a
nervous
irritable
temperament
with
a
disorderly
overweening
mind
and
it
was
he
who
was
now
speaking
to
his
companion
in
a
very
loud
voice
and
with
sweeping
gestures
prizes
are
to
be
given
at
the
brothers
school
this
afternoon
said
madame
duparque
by
way
of
explanation
philibin
who
is
very
fond
of
our
good
brothers
has
consented
to
preside
at
the
distribution
he
must
have
just
arrived
from
valmarie
and
i
suppose
he
is
going
with
brother
fulgence
to
settle
certain
details
but
she
was
interrupted
for
marc
had
at
last
made
his
appearance
carrying
his
little
louise
who
scarcely
two
years
old
hung
about
his
neck
playing
and
laughing
blissfully
puff
puff
the
young
man
exclaimed
as
he
entered
the
room
we
are
in
the
railway
train
one
ca
come
quicker
than
by
train
eh
shorter
than
his
three
brothers
mathieu
luc
and
jean
marc
froment
had
a
longer
and
a
thinner
face
with
the
lofty
towerlike
family
forehead
greatly
developed
but
his
particular
characteristics
were
his
eyes
and
voice
soft
clear
eyes
which
dived
into
one
soul
and
an
engaging
conquering
voice
which
won
both
mind
and
heart
though
he
wore
moustaches
and
a
slight
beard
one
could
see
his
rather
large
firm
and
kindly
mouth
like
all
the
sons
of
pierre
and
marie
froment
he
had
learned
a
manual
calling
that
of
a
lithographer
and
securing
his
bachelor
degree
when
seventeen
years
of
age
he
had
come
to
beaumont
to
complete
his
apprenticeship
with
the
the
great
firm
which
supplied
maps
and
diagrams
to
almost
every
school
in
france
it
was
at
this
time
that
his
passion
for
teaching
declared
itself
impelling
him
to
enter
the
training
college
of
beaumont
which
he
had
quitted
in
his
twentieth
year
as
an
provided
with
a
superior
certificate
having
subsequently
secured
that
of
teaching
capacity
he
was
when
seven
and
twenty
about
to
be
appointed
schoolmaster
at
jonville
when
he
married
geneviève
berthereau
thanks
to
his
good
friend
salvan
who
introduced
him
to
the
ladies
and
who
was
moved
by
the
sight
of
the
love
which
drew
the
young
folk
together
and
now
for
three
years
past
marc
and
geneviève
though
their
means
were
scanty
and
they
experienced
all
manner
of
pecuniary
straits
and
administrative
worries
had
been
leading
a
delightful
life
of
love
in
their
secluded
village
which
numbered
barely
eight
hundred
souls
footnote

but
the
happy
laughter
of
the
father
and
the
little
girl
did
not
dissipate
the
displeasure
of
madame
duparque
railway
train
is
not
worth
the
coaches
of
my
youth
said
she
let
us
breakfast
quickly
we
shall
never
get
there
she
had
seated
herself
and
was
already
pouring
some
milk
into
the
cups
while
geneviève
placed
little
louise
between
herself
and
her
mother
in
order
to
keep
a
good
watch
over
the
child
marc
who
was
in
a
conciliatory
mood
tried
to
secure
the
old
lady
forgiveness
i
have
delayed
you
eh
he
said
it
is
your
fault
grandmother
one
sleeps
too
soundly
in
your
house
it
is
so
very
quiet
madame
duparque
who
was
hurrying
over
her
breakfast
with
her
nose
in
her
cup
did
not
condescend
to
answer
but
a
pale
smile
appeared
on
the
face
of
madame
berthereau
after
she
had
directed
a
long
look
at
geneviève
who
seemed
so
happy
between
her
husband
and
her
child
and
in
a
low
voice
as
if
speaking
involuntarily
the
younger
widow
murmured
glancing
slowly
around
her
very
quiet
so
quiet
that
one
can
not
even
feel
that
one
is
living
the
same
there
was
some
noise
on
the
square
at
ten
marc
retorted
was
amazed
the
idea
of
a
disturbance
at
night
on
the
place
des
capucins
he
had
blundered
badly
in
his
desire
to
make
the
others
laugh
this
time
it
was
the
grandmother
who
with
an
offended
air
replied
was
the
worshippers
leaving
the
capuchin
chapel
the
offices
of
the
adoration
of
the
holy
sacrament
were
celebrated
yesterday
evening
at
nine
the
brothers
took
with
them
those
of
their
pupils
who
attended
their
first
communion
this
year
and
the
children
were
rather
free
in
talking
and
laughing
as
they
crossed
the
square
but
that
is
far
better
than
the
abominable
pastimes
of
the
children
who
are
brought
up
without
moral
or
religious
guidance
silence
deep
and
embarrassing
fell
immediately
only
the
rattle
of
the
spoons
in
the
cups
was
to
be
heard
that
accusation
of
abominable
pastimes
was
directed
against
marc
school
with
its
system
of
secular
education
but
as
geneviève
turned
on
him
a
little
glance
of
entreaty
he
did
not
lose
his
temper
before
long
he
even
resumed
the
conversation
speaking
to
madame
berthereau
of
his
life
at
jonville
and
also
of
his
pupils
like
a
master
who
was
attached
to
them
and
who
derived
from
them
pleasure
and
satisfaction
three
said
he
had
just
obtained
the
certificate
awarded
for
successful
elementary
studies
but
at
this
moment
the
church
bell
again
rang
out
slowly
sending
a
wail
through
the
heavy
atmosphere
above
the
mournful
deserted
district
last
bell
cried
madame
duparque
said
that
we
should
never
get
there
in
time
she
rose
and
had
already
begun
to
hustle
her
daughter
and
her
granddaughter
who
were
finishing
their
coffee
when
pélagie
the
servant
again
appeared
this
time
trembling
almost
beside
herself
and
with
a
copy
of
petit
in
her
hand
madame
madame
how
horrible
the
newspaper
boy
has
just
told
me
make
haste
the
servant
was
stifling
little
zéphirin
the
schoolmaster
nephew
has
just
been
found
murdered
there
quite
near
in
his
room
madame
strangled
in
his
nightdress
it
is
an
abominable
affair
a
terrible
shudder
swept
through
the
room
even
madame
duparque
quivered
zéphirin
said
she
yes
the
nephew
of
simon
the
jew
schoolmaster
a
child
with
a
pretty
face
but
infirm
for
his
part
the
lad
was
a
catholic
he
went
to
the
brothers
school
and
he
must
have
been
at
the
ceremony
last
night
for
he
took
his
first
communion
lately
but
what
can
you
expect
some
families
are
accursed
marc
had
listened
chilled
and
indignant
and
careless
now
whether
he
gave
offence
or
not
he
answered
i
know
simon
he
was
at
the
training
college
with
me
he
is
only
two
years
older
than
myself
i
know
nobody
with
a
firmer
intellect
a
more
affectionate
heart
he
had
given
shelter
to
that
poor
child
that
catholic
nephew
and
allowed
him
to
attend
the
brothers
school
from
conscientious
scruples
which
are
seldom
found
what
a
frightful
blow
has
fallen
on
him
then
the
young
man
rose
quivering
am
going
to
him
he
added
want
to
hear
everything
i
want
to
sustain
him
in
his
grief
but
madame
duparque
no
longer
listened
she
was
pushing
madame
berthereau
and
geneviève
outside
scarcely
allowing
them
time
to
put
on
their
hats
the
ringing
of
the
last
bell
had
just
ceased
and
the
ladies
hastened
towards
the
church
amidst
the
heavy
silence
of
the
deserted
square
and
marc
after
entrusting
little
louise
to
pélagie
in
his
turn
went
out
the
elementary
schools
of
maillebois
newly
built
and
divided
into
two
pavilions
one
for
boys
and
one
for
girls
stood
on
the
place
de
la
république
in
front
of
the
town
hall
which
was
also
a
new
building
of
corresponding
architecture
and
only
the
high
street
really
a
section
of
the
road
from
beaumont
to
jonville
running
across
the
square
separated
the
two
edifices
which
with
their
chalky
whiteness
were
the
pride
of
the
district
the
high
street
which
the
parish
church
of
martin
likewise
faced
a
little
further
down
was
as
became
a
centre
of
trade
a
populous
thoroughfare
animated
by
the
constant
coming
and
going
of
pedestrians
and
vehicles
but
silence
and
solitude
were
found
again
behind
the
schools
and
weeds
sprouted
there
between
the
little
a
street
the
rue
courte
in
which
one
found
but
the
parsonage
and
a
stationer
shop
kept
by
mesdames
milhomme
connected
the
sleepy
end
of
the
place
de
la
république
with
the
place
des
capucins
in
such
wise
that
marc
had
few
steps
to
take
the
school
playgrounds
faced
the
rue
courte
and
were
separated
by
two
little
gardens
set
apart
for
the
schoolmaster
and
the
schoolmistress
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
boys
pavilion
at
a
corner
of
the
playground
was
a
tiny
room
which
simon
had
been
able
to
give
to
little
zéphirin
on
taking
charge
of
him
the
boy
was
a
nephew
of
his
wife
rachel
lehmann
and
a
grandson
of
the
old
lehmanns
who
were
poor
jew
tailors
dwelling
in
the
rue
du
trou
the
most
wretched
street
of
maillebois
zéphirin
father
daniel
lehmann
a
mechanician
had
contracted
a
with
a
catholic
girl
an
orphan
named
marie
prunier
who
had
been
reared
by
the
sisters
and
was
a
dressmaker
the
young
couple
adored
each
other
and
at
first
their
son
zéphirin
was
not
baptised
nor
indeed
brought
up
in
any
religious
faith
neither
parent
desiring
to
grieve
the
other
by
rearing
the
child
according
to
his
or
her
particular
creed
but
after
the
lapse
of
six
years
a
thunderbolt
fell
daniel
met
with
a
frightful
death
being
caught
and
crushed
to
pieces
in
some
machinery
before
the
very
eyes
of
his
wife
who
had
come
to
the
works
bringing
his
lunch
with
her
and
marie
terrified
by
the
sight
won
back
to
the
religion
of
her
youth
picturing
the
catastrophe
as
the
chastisement
of
heaven
which
thereby
punished
her
for
her
guilt
in
having
loved
a
jew
soon
caused
her
son
to
be
baptised
and
sent
him
to
the
brothers
school
unhappily
through
some
hereditary
taint
or
flaw
the
lad
frame
became
distorted
he
grew
gradually
humpbacked
in
which
misfortune
the
mother
imagined
she
could
trace
the
implacable
wrath
of
god
pursuing
her
relentlessly
because
she
was
unable
to
pluck
from
her
heart
the
fond
memory
of
the
husband
she
had
adored
that
anguish
combined
with
excessive
toil
ended
by
killing
her
about
the
time
when
little
zéphirin
having
reached
his
eleventh
birthday
was
ready
to
take
his
first
communion
it
was
then
that
simon
though
poor
himself
gave
the
boy
shelter
in
order
that
he
might
not
become
a
charge
on
his
wife
relations
at
the
same
time
the
schoolmaster
who
was
tolerant
as
well
as
contented
himself
with
lodging
and
feeding
his
nephew
allowing
him
to
communicate
as
a
catholic
and
to
complete
his
studies
at
the
school
the
little
room
in
which
zéphirin
slept
formerly
a
kind
of
but
tidily
arranged
for
him
had
a
window
opening
almost
on
a
level
with
the
ground
behind
the
school
the
spot
being
the
most
secluded
of
the
square
and
that
morning
about
seven
as
young
mignot
the
who
slept
on
the
first
floor
of
the
building
went
out
he
noticed
that
zéphirin
window
was
wide
open
mignot
was
passionately
fond
of
fishing
and
profiting
by
the
arrival
of
the
vacation
he
was
about
to
start
in
a
straw
hat
and
a
linen
jacket
and
with
his
rod
on
his
shoulder
for
the
banks
of
the
verpille
a
streamlet
which
ran
through
the
industrial
quarter
of
maillebois
a
peasant
by
birth
he
had
entered
the
beaumont
training
college
even
as
he
might
have
entered
a
seminary
in
order
to
escape
the
hard
labour
of
the
fields
fair
with
hair
he
had
a
massive
face
which
gave
him
an
appearance
of
sternness
though
he
was
not
hardhearted
being
indeed
rather
kindly
disposed
but
his
chief
care
was
to
do
nothing
which
might
impede
his
advancement
he
was
five
and
twenty
years
of
age
but
showed
no
haste
to
get
married
waiting
in
that
respect
as
in
others
and
destined
to
become
such
as
circumstances
might
decree
that
morning
he
was
greatly
struck
by
the
sight
of
zéphirin
open
window
although
there
was
nothing
very
extraordinary
in
such
a
thing
for
the
lad
usually
rose
at
an
early
hour
however
the
young
master
drew
near
and
glanced
into
the
room
then
stupefaction
rooted
him
to
the
spot
and
his
horror
found
vent
in
cries
god
the
poor
boy
o
god
god
what
can
have
happened
what
a
terrible
misfortune
the
tiny
room
with
its
light
wall
paper
retained
its
wonted
quietude
its
suggestion
of
happy
boyhood
on
the
table
was
a
coloured
statuette
of
the
virgin
with
a
few
books
and
little
prints
of
a
religious
character
carefully
arranged
and
classified
the
small
white
bed
was
in
no
wise
disarranged
the
lad
had
not
slept
in
it
that
night
the
only
sign
of
disorder
was
an
overturned
chair
but
on
the
rug
beside
the
bed
zéphirin
was
lying
strangled
his
face
livid
his
bare
neck
showing
the
imprint
of
his
murderer
cruel
fingers
his
rent
garment
allowed
a
glimpse
of
his
misshapen
spine
the
hump
that
jutted
out
below
his
left
arm
which
was
thrown
back
across
his
head
in
spite
of
its
bluish
pallor
his
face
retained
its
charm
it
was
the
face
of
a
fair
angel
delicately
girlish
with
blue
eyes
a
slender
nose
and
a
small
sweet
mouth
whose
gentle
laugh
in
happy
hours
had
brought
delightful
dimples
to
the
child
cheeks
but
mignot
quite
beside
himself
did
not
cease
to
cry
his
horror
aloud
god
god
how
frightful
for
god
sake
help
help
come
quickly
then
mademoiselle
rouzaire
the
schoolmistress
who
heard
the
cries
hastened
to
the
spot
she
had
been
paying
an
early
visit
to
her
garden
being
anxious
about
some
lettuces
which
the
stormy
weather
was
helping
to
go
to
seed
she
was
a
woman
of
two
and
thirty
tall
and
strongly
built
with
a
round
freckled
face
big
grey
eyes
pale
lips
and
a
pointed
nose
which
denoted
cunning
and
avaricious
harshness
ugly
though
she
was
her
name
had
been
associated
with
that
of
the
handsome
mauraisin
the
elementary
inspector
whose
support
ensured
her
advancement
moreover
she
was
devoted
to
abbé
quandieu
the
parish
priest
the
capuchins
and
even
the
christian
brothers
and
personally
conducted
her
pupils
to
the
catechism
classes
and
the
church
ceremonies
as
soon
as
she
beheld
the
horrid
sight
she
also
raised
an
outcry
lord
take
pity
on
us
it
is
a
massacre
it
is
the
devil
work
o
god
of
mercy
then
as
mignot
was
about
to
spring
over
the
she
prevented
him
no
do
go
in
one
must
ascertain
one
must
call
as
she
turned
round
as
if
seeking
somebody
she
perceived
father
philibin
and
brother
fulgence
emerging
from
the
rue
courte
on
their
way
from
the
place
des
capucins
across
which
geneviève
had
seen
them
pass
she
recognised
them
and
raised
her
arms
to
heaven
as
if
at
the
sight
of
providence
father
oh
brother
come
come
at
once
the
devil
has
been
here
the
two
clerics
drew
near
and
experienced
a
terrible
shock
but
father
philibin
who
was
energetic
and
of
a
thoughtful
bent
remained
silent
whereas
impulsive
brother
fulgence
ever
prompt
to
throw
himself
forward
burst
into
exclamations
the
poor
child
ah
what
a
horrid
crime
so
gentle
and
so
good
a
lad
the
best
of
our
pupils
so
pious
and
fervent
too
come
we
must
investigate
this
matter
we
can
not
leave
things
as
they
are
this
time
mademoiselle
rouzaire
did
not
dare
to
protest
as
the
brother
sprang
over
the
followed
by
father
philibin
who
having
perceived
a
ball
of
paper
lying
near
the
boy
at
once
picked
it
up
from
fear
or
rather
prudence
the
schoolmistress
did
not
join
the
others
indeed
she
even
detained
mignot
outside
for
another
moment
that
which
the
ministers
of
the
deity
might
venture
to
do
was
not
fit
perhaps
for
mere
teachers
meantime
while
brother
fulgence
bent
over
the
victim
without
touching
him
but
again
raising
tumultuous
exclamations
father
philibin
still
silent
unrolled
the
paper
ball
and
to
all
appearance
examined
it
carefully
he
was
turning
his
back
to
the
window
and
one
could
only
see
the
play
of
his
elbows
without
distinguishing
the
paper
the
rustling
of
which
could
be
heard
this
went
on
for
a
few
moments
and
when
mignot
in
his
turn
sprang
into
the
room
he
saw
that
the
ball
which
father
philibin
had
picked
up
had
been
formed
of
a
newspaper
in
the
midst
of
which
a
narrow
crumpled
and
stained
slip
of
white
paper
appeared
the
jesuit
looked
at
the
and
quietly
and
slowly
remarked
is
a
number
of
petit
dated
yesterday
august
but
the
singular
thing
is
that
crumpled
up
in
it
there
should
be
this
for
a
writing
lesson
just
look
at
it
as
the
slip
had
been
noticed
by
mignot
already
father
philibin
could
not
do
otherwise
than
show
it
but
he
kept
it
between
his
big
fingers
so
that
the
other
only
distinguished
the
words
vous
les
uns
les
one
another
lithographed
in
a
rents
and
stains
made
this
a
mere
rag
of
paper
and
the
gave
it
only
a
brief
glance
for
fresh
exclamations
now
arose
at
the
window
they
came
from
marc
who
had
just
arrived
and
who
was
filled
with
horror
and
indignation
at
the
sight
of
the
poor
little
victim
without
listening
to
the
schoolmistress
explanations
he
brushed
her
aside
and
vaulted
over
the
the
presence
of
the
two
clerics
astonished
him
but
he
learnt
from
mignot
that
he
and
mademoiselle
rouzaire
had
summoned
them
as
they
were
passing
immediately
after
the
discovery
of
the
crime
touch
or
disturb
anything
marc
exclaimed
must
at
once
send
to
the
mayor
and
the
gendarmerie
people
were
collecting
already
and
a
young
man
who
undertook
the
suggested
commission
set
off
at
a
run
while
marc
continued
to
inspect
the
room
in
front
of
the
body
he
saw
brother
fulgence
distracted
with
compassion
with
his
eyes
full
of
tears
like
a
man
of
nervous
temperament
unable
to
control
emotion
marc
was
really
touched
by
the
brother
demeanour
he
himself
shuddered
at
the
sight
of
what
he
beheld
for
the
abominable
nature
of
the
crime
was
quite
evident
and
a
thought
which
was
to
return
later
on
as
a
conviction
suddenly
flitted
through
his
mind
then
left
him
in
such
wise
that
he
was
only
conscious
of
the
presence
of
father
philibin
who
full
of
deep
distressful
calm
still
held
the
newspaper
and
the
for
a
moment
the
jesuit
had
turned
round
as
if
to
look
under
the
bed
then
however
he
had
stepped
back
see
he
said
without
waiting
to
be
questioned
is
what
i
found
on
the
floor
rolled
into
a
ball
which
the
murderer
certainly
tried
to
thrust
into
the
child
mouth
as
a
gag
in
order
to
stifle
his
cries
as
he
did
not
succeed
he
strangled
him
on
this
soiled
by
saliva
one
can
see
the
marks
left
by
the
poor
little
fellow
teeth
the
ball
was
lying
yonder
near
that
leg
of
the
table
is
that
not
so
monsieur
mignot
you
saw
it
quite
so
replied
the
noticed
it
at
once
as
he
drew
near
again
and
examined
the
copy
he
felt
vaguely
surprised
on
noticing
that
the
corner
of
the
slip
of
paper
was
torn
off
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
not
remarked
that
deficiency
when
the
jesuit
had
first
shown
him
the
slip
but
perhaps
it
had
then
been
hidden
by
father
philibin
big
fingers
however
mignot
memory
grew
confused
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
say
whether
that
corner
had
been
torn
away
in
the
first
instance
or
not
marc
however
having
taken
the
slip
from
the
jesuit
was
studying
it
and
expressing
his
thoughts
aloud
yes
it
has
been
bitten
but
it
wo
be
much
of
an
indication
for
such
slips
are
sold
currently
one
can
find
them
everywhere
oh
but
there
is
a
kind
of
flourish
down
here
i
see
some
initialling
which
one
can
not
well
decipher
without
any
haste
father
philibin
stepped
up
to
him
initialling
do
you
think
so
it
seemed
to
me
a
mere
blot
half
effaced
by
saliva
and
by
the
bite
which
pierced
the
slip
close
by
blot
no
these
marks
are
certainly
initials
but
they
are
quite
illegible
then
noticing
that
a
corner
of
the
slip
was
deficient
marc
added
no
doubt
was
done
by
another
bite
have
you
found
the
missing
piece
father
philibin
answered
that
he
had
not
looked
for
it
and
he
again
unfolded
the
newspaper
and
examined
it
carefully
while
mignot
stooping
searched
the
floor
nothing
was
found
besides
the
matter
was
regarded
as
being
of
no
importance
marc
agreed
with
the
two
clerics
that
the
murderer
seized
with
terror
must
have
strangled
the
boy
after
vainly
endeavouring
to
stifle
his
cries
by
stuffing
the
paper
gag
into
his
mouth
the
extraordinary
circumstance
was
that
the
should
have
been
found
rolled
up
with
the
newspaper
the
presence
of
a
number
of
petit
could
be
understood
for
anybody
might
have
one
in
his
pocket
but
whence
had
that
slip
come
how
did
it
happen
to
be
crumpled
almost
kneaded
with
the
newspaper
all
sorts
of
suppositions
were
allowable
and
the
officers
of
the
law
would
have
to
open
an
investigation
in
order
to
discover
the
truth
to
marc
it
seemed
as
if
a
calamitous
gust
had
just
swept
through
the
dim
tragedy
suddenly
steeping
everything
in
horrid
night
he
murmured
involuntarily
is
crime
the
monster
in
the
depths
of
his
dark
pit
meantime
people
continued
to
assemble
before
the
window
on
perceiving
the
throng
the
mesdames
milhomme
who
kept
the
neighbouring
stationery
business
had
hastened
from
their
shop
madame
alexandre
who
was
tall
fair
and
gentle
in
appearance
and
madame
edouard
who
was
also
tall
but
dark
and
somewhat
rough
felt
the
more
concerned
as
victor
the
latter
son
went
to
the
brothers
school
while
sébastien
the
former
boy
attended
simon
thus
they
listened
eagerly
to
mademoiselle
rouzaire
who
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
group
was
giving
various
particulars
pending
the
arrival
of
the
mayor
and
the
gendarmes
went
myself
she
said
that
touching
adoration
of
the
holy
sacrament
at
the
capuchin
chapel
last
evening
and
poor
zéphirin
was
there
with
a
few
schoolfellows
those
who
took
their
first
communion
this
year
he
edified
us
all
he
looked
a
little
angel
son
victor
did
not
go
for
he
is
only
nine
years
old
madame
edouard
answered
did
zéphirin
go
alone
did
nobody
bring
him
back
the
chapel
is
only
a
few
yards
distant
the
schoolmistress
explained
know
that
brother
gorgias
had
orders
to
escort
the
children
whose
parents
could
not
attend
and
whose
homes
are
rather
distant
but
madame
simon
asked
me
to
watch
over
zéphirin
and
it
was
i
who
brought
him
back
he
was
very
gay
he
opened
the
shutters
which
were
simply
pushed
to
and
sprang
into
his
room
through
the
open
window
laughing
and
saying
that
it
was
the
easiest
and
shortest
way
i
stayed
outside
for
a
moment
waiting
until
he
had
lighted
his
candle
marc
drawing
near
had
listened
attentively
time
was
it
he
now
inquired
ten
mademoiselle
rouzaire
replied
martin
clock
was
striking
the
others
shuddered
moved
by
that
account
of
the
lad
springing
so
gaily
into
the
room
where
he
was
to
meet
such
a
tragic
death
and
madame
alexandre
gently
gave
expression
to
a
thought
which
suggested
itself
to
all
was
hardly
prudent
to
let
the
lad
sleep
by
himself
in
this
lonely
room
so
easily
reached
from
the
square
the
shutters
ought
to
have
been
barred
at
night
he
fastened
them
said
mademoiselle
rouzaire
he
do
so
last
night
while
you
were
here
inquired
marc
intervening
once
more
when
i
left
him
to
go
to
my
rooms
he
had
lighted
his
candle
and
was
arranging
some
pictures
on
his
table
with
the
window
wide
open
mignot
the
now
joined
in
the
conversation
window
made
monsieur
simon
anxious
he
said
wished
he
could
have
given
the
lad
another
room
he
often
recommended
him
to
fasten
the
shutters
carefully
but
i
fear
that
the
child
paid
little
heed
the
two
clerics
in
their
turn
had
now
decided
to
quit
the
room
father
philibin
after
laying
the
number
of
petit
and
the
on
the
table
had
ceased
speaking
preferring
to
look
and
listen
and
he
followed
very
attentively
each
word
and
gesture
that
came
from
marc
while
brother
fulgence
for
his
part
continued
to
relieve
himself
with
lamentations
eventually
the
jesuit
who
seemed
to
read
the
young
schoolmaster
thoughts
in
his
eyes
remarked
to
him
you
think
that
some
tramp
some
night
prowler
seeing
the
boy
alone
in
this
room
may
have
got
in
by
the
window
from
prudence
marc
would
express
no
positive
opinion
i
think
nothing
said
he
is
for
the
law
to
seek
and
find
the
murderer
however
the
bed
has
not
been
opened
the
boy
was
certainly
about
to
get
into
it
and
this
seems
to
show
that
the
crime
must
have
been
committed
shortly
after
ten
suppose
that
he
busied
himself
for
half
an
hour
at
the
utmost
with
his
pictures
and
that
he
then
saw
a
stranger
spring
into
his
room
in
that
case
he
would
have
raised
a
cry
which
would
certainly
have
been
heard
you
heard
nothing
did
you
mademoiselle
nothing
the
schoolmistress
replied
myself
went
to
bed
about
ten
the
neighbourhood
was
very
quiet
the
storm
did
not
awaken
me
until
about
one
this
morning
little
of
the
candle
has
been
burnt
mignot
now
observed
murderer
must
have
blown
it
out
as
he
went
off
by
the
window
which
he
left
wide
open
as
i
found
it
just
now
these
remarks
which
lent
some
weight
to
the
theory
of
a
prowler
springing
into
the
room
and
murdering
the
boy
increased
the
embarrassment
of
the
bystanders
all
wished
to
avoid
being
compromised
and
therefore
kept
to
themselves
their
thoughts
respecting
the
impossibilities
or
improbabilities
of
the
theory
which
had
been
propounded
after
a
pause
however
as
the
mayor
and
the
gendarmes
did
not
appear
father
philibin
inquired
not
monsieur
simon
at
maillebois
mignot
who
had
not
recovered
from
the
shock
of
his
discovery
gazed
at
the
jesuit
with
haggard
eyes
to
bring
the
to
his
senses
marc
himself
had
to
express
his
astonishment
simon
is
surely
in
his
rooms
has
he
not
been
told
no
the
assistant
answered
must
have
lost
my
head
monsieur
simon
went
to
attend
a
banquet
at
beaumont
yesterday
evening
but
he
certainly
came
home
during
the
night
his
wife
is
rather
poorly
they
must
be
still
in
bed
it
was
now
already
seven
but
the
stormy
sky
remained
so
dark
and
heavy
that
one
might
have
thought
dawn
was
only
just
appearing
in
that
secluded
corner
of
the
square
however
the
made
up
his
mind
and
ascended
the
stairs
to
fetch
simon
what
a
happy
awakening
it
would
be
for
the
latter
he
muttered
sarcastically
and
what
an
agreeable
commission
for
himself
was
that
which
he
had
to
fulfil
with
his
chief
simon
was
the
younger
son
of
a
jew
clockmaker
of
beaumont
he
had
a
brother
david
who
was
his
elder
by
three
years
when
he
was
fifteen
and
david
eighteen
their
father
ruined
by
lawsuits
succumbed
to
a
sudden
attack
of
apoplexy
and
three
years
later
their
mother
died
in
very
straitened
circumstances
simon
had
then
just
entered
the
training
college
while
david
joined
the
army
the
former
quitting
the
college
at
an
early
age
became
at
dherbecourt
a
large
of
the
district
where
he
remained
nearly
ten
years
there
also
in
his
year
he
married
rachel
lehmann
the
daughter
of
the
little
tailor
of
the
rue
du
trou
who
had
a
fair
number
of
customers
at
maillebois
rachel
a
brunette
with
magnificent
hair
and
large
caressing
eyes
was
very
beautiful
her
husband
adored
her
encompassed
her
with
passionate
worship
two
children
had
been
born
to
them
a
boy
joseph
now
four
and
a
girl
sarah
two
years
of
age
and
simon
duly
provided
with
a
certificate
of
teaching
capacity
was
proud
of
the
fact
that
at
two
and
thirty
he
should
be
schoolmaster
at
maillebois
where
he
had
now
dwelt
a
couple
of
years
for
this
was
an
instance
of
rapid
advancement
marc
though
he
disliked
the
jews
by
reason
of
a
sort
of
hereditary
antipathy
and
distrust
the
causes
of
which
he
had
never
troubled
to
analyse
retained
a
friendly
recollection
of
simon
whom
he
had
known
at
the
training
college
he
declared
him
to
be
extremely
intelligent
a
very
good
teacher
full
of
a
sense
of
duty
but
he
found
him
too
attentive
to
petty
details
too
slavishly
observant
of
regulations
which
he
followed
to
the
very
letter
ever
bending
low
before
discipline
as
if
fearful
of
a
bad
report
and
the
dissatisfaction
of
his
superiors
in
this
marc
traced
the
terror
and
humility
of
the
jewish
race
persecuted
for
so
many
centuries
and
ever
retaining
a
dread
of
outrage
and
iniquity
moreover
simon
had
good
cause
for
prudence
for
his
appointment
at
maillebois
that
clerical
little
town
with
its
powerful
capuchin
community
and
its
brothers
school
had
caused
almost
a
scandal
it
was
only
by
dint
of
correctitude
and
particularly
of
ardent
patriotism
among
his
pupils
such
as
the
glorification
of
france
as
a
military
power
the
foretelling
of
national
glory
and
a
supreme
position
among
the
nations
that
simon
obtained
forgiveness
for
being
a
jew
he
now
suddenly
made
his
appearance
accompanied
by
mignot
short
thin
and
sinewy
he
had
red
hair
and
a
sparse
beard
his
blue
eyes
were
soft
his
mouth
was
well
shaped
his
nose
of
the
racial
type
long
and
slender
yet
his
physiognomy
was
scarcely
prepossessing
it
remained
vague
confused
paltry
and
at
that
moment
he
was
so
terribly
upset
by
the
dreadful
tidings
that
as
he
appeared
before
the
others
staggering
and
stammering
one
might
have
thought
him
intoxicated
god
is
it
possible
he
gasped
villainy
such
monstrosity
but
he
reached
the
window
where
he
remained
like
one
overwhelmed
unable
to
speak
another
word
and
shuddering
from
head
to
foot
his
glance
fixed
meanwhile
on
the
little
victim
those
who
were
present
the
two
clerics
the
lady
stationers
and
the
schoolmasters
watched
him
in
silence
astonished
that
he
did
not
weep
marc
stirred
by
compassion
took
hold
of
his
hands
and
embraced
him
you
must
muster
your
courage
you
need
all
your
strength
he
said
to
him
but
simon
without
listening
turned
to
his
assistant
go
back
to
my
wife
mignot
he
said
do
not
want
her
to
see
this
she
was
very
fond
of
her
nephew
and
she
is
too
poorly
to
be
able
to
bear
such
a
horrible
sight
then
as
the
young
man
went
off
he
continued
in
broken
accents
what
an
awakening
for
once
in
a
while
we
were
lying
late
in
bed
my
poor
rachel
was
still
asleep
and
as
i
did
not
wish
to
disturb
her
i
remained
by
her
side
thinking
of
our
holiday
pleasures
i
roused
her
late
last
night
when
i
came
home
and
she
did
not
get
to
sleep
again
till
three
in
the
morning
for
the
storm
upset
her
time
was
it
when
you
came
home
marc
inquired
twenty
minutes
to
twelve
my
wife
asked
me
the
time
and
i
looked
at
the
clock
this
seemed
to
surprise
mademoiselle
rouzaire
who
remarked
there
is
no
train
from
beaumont
at
that
hour
did
come
back
by
train
simon
explained
banquet
lasted
till
late
i
missed
the
train
and
rather
than
wait
for
the
one
at
midnight
i
decided
to
walk
the
distance
i
was
anxious
to
join
my
wife
father
philibin
still
preserved
silence
and
calmness
but
brother
fulgence
unable
to
restrain
himself
any
longer
began
to
question
simon
minutes
to
twelve
then
the
crime
must
have
been
committed
already
you
saw
nothing
you
heard
nothing
at
all
the
square
was
deserted
the
storm
was
beginning
to
rumble
in
the
distance
i
did
not
meet
a
soul
all
was
quiet
in
the
house
it
did
not
occur
to
you
to
go
to
see
if
poor
zéphirin
had
returned
safely
from
the
chapel
and
if
he
were
sleeping
soundly
did
you
not
pay
him
a
visit
every
evening
he
was
already
a
very
shrewd
little
man
and
we
left
him
as
much
liberty
as
possible
besides
the
place
was
so
quiet
there
was
nothing
to
suggest
any
reason
for
disturbing
his
sleep
i
went
straight
upstairs
to
my
room
making
the
least
possible
noise
i
kissed
my
children
who
were
asleep
then
i
went
to
bed
and
well
pleased
to
find
my
wife
rather
better
i
chatted
with
her
in
an
undertone
father
philibin
nodded
as
if
approvingly
and
then
remarked
everything
can
be
accounted
for
the
bystanders
seemed
convinced
the
theory
of
a
prowler
committing
the
crime
about
ten
entering
and
leaving
the
room
by
the
window
seemed
more
and
more
probable
simon
statement
confirmed
the
information
given
by
mignot
and
mademoiselle
rouzaire
moreover
the
mesdames
milhomme
the
stationers
asserted
that
they
had
seen
an
man
roaming
about
the
square
at
nightfall
are
so
many
rascals
on
the
roads
said
the
jesuit
father
by
way
of
conclusion
must
hope
that
the
police
will
set
hands
on
the
murderer
though
such
a
task
is
not
always
an
easy
one
marc
alone
experienced
a
feeling
of
uncertainty
although
he
had
been
the
first
to
think
it
possible
that
some
stranger
might
have
sprung
on
zéphirin
he
had
gradually
realised
that
there
was
little
probability
of
such
an
occurrence
was
it
not
more
likely
that
the
man
had
been
acquainted
with
the
boy
and
had
at
first
approached
him
as
a
friend
then
however
had
come
the
abominable
impulse
horror
and
murder
strangulation
as
a
last
resource
to
stifle
the
victim
cries
followed
by
flight
amidst
a
gust
of
terror
but
all
this
remained
very
involved
and
after
some
brief
perception
of
its
probability
marc
relapsed
into
darkness
into
the
anxiety
born
of
contradictory
suppositions
he
contented
himself
with
saying
to
simon
by
way
of
calming
him
the
evidence
agrees
the
truth
will
soon
be
made
manifest
at
that
moment
just
as
mignot
returned
after
prevailing
on
madame
simon
to
remain
in
her
room
darras
the
mayor
of
maillebois
arrived
with
three
gendarmes
a
building
contractor
on
the
high
road
to
a
considerable
fortune
darras
was
a
stout
man
of
with
a
fair
round
pinky
face
he
immediately
ordered
the
shutters
to
be
closed
and
placed
two
gendarmes
outside
the
window
while
the
third
entering
the
house
passage
went
to
guard
the
door
of
the
room
which
zéphirin
never
locked
from
this
moment
the
orders
were
that
nothing
should
be
touched
and
that
nobody
should
even
approach
the
scene
of
the
crime
on
hearing
of
it
the
mayor
had
immediately
telegraphed
to
the
public
prosecution
office
at
beaumont
and
the
magistrates
would
surely
arrive
by
the
first
train
father
philibin
and
brother
fulgence
now
spoke
of
having
to
attend
to
various
matters
connected
with
the
distribution
of
prizes
which
was
to
take
place
in
the
afternoon
and
darras
advised
them
to
make
haste
and
then
return
for
said
he
the
procureur
de
la
république
otherwise
the
public
prosecutor
would
certainly
wish
to
question
them
about
the
number
of
petit
and
the
found
near
the
body
so
the
two
clerics
took
their
departure
and
while
the
gendarmes
stationed
on
the
square
outside
the
window
with
difficulty
restrained
the
now
increasing
crowd
which
became
violent
and
raised
threatening
cries
demanding
the
execution
of
the
unknown
murderer
simon
again
went
into
the
building
with
darras
marc
mademoiselle
rouzaire
and
mignot
the
whole
party
waiting
in
a
large
classroom
lighted
by
broad
windows
which
faced
the
playground
it
was
now
eight
and
after
a
sudden
stormy
rainfall
the
sky
cleared
and
the
day
became
a
splendid
one
an
hour
elapsed
before
the
magistrates
arrived
the
procureur
de
la
république
raoul
de
la
bissonnière
came
in
person
accompanied
by
daix
the
investigating
magistrate
both
were
moved
by
the
magnitude
of
the
crime
and
foresaw
a
great
trial
la
bissonnière
a
dapper
little
man
with
a
face
and
whiskers
of
a
correct
legal
cut
was
very
ambitious
not
content
with
his
rapid
advancement
to
the
post
he
held
he
was
only
he
was
ever
on
the
watch
for
some
resounding
case
which
would
launch
him
in
paris
where
thanks
to
his
suppleness
and
address
his
complaisant
respect
for
the
powers
of
the
day
whatever
they
might
be
he
relied
on
securing
a
high
position
on
the
other
hand
daix
tall
and
lean
with
a
face
was
a
type
of
the
punctilious
investigating
magistrate
devoted
to
his
professional
duties
but
he
was
also
of
an
anxious
and
timid
nature
for
his
ugly
but
coquettish
and
extravagant
wife
exasperated
by
the
poverty
of
their
home
terrorised
and
distressed
him
with
her
bitter
reproaches
respecting
his
lack
of
ambition
on
reaching
the
schools
the
legal
functionaries
before
taking
any
evidence
desired
to
visit
the
scene
of
the
crime
simon
and
darras
accompanied
them
to
zéphirin
while
the
others
who
were
soon
joined
by
father
philibin
and
brother
fulgence
waited
in
the
large
classroom
when
the
magistrates
returned
thither
they
had
verified
all
the
material
features
of
the
crime
and
were
acquainted
with
the
various
circumstances
already
known
to
the
others
they
brought
with
them
the
number
of
petit
and
the
to
which
they
seemed
to
attach
extreme
importance
at
once
seating
themselves
at
simon
table
they
examined
those
two
pieces
of
evidence
exchanging
impressions
concerning
them
and
then
showing
the
to
the
two
schoolmasters
simon
and
marc
as
well
as
to
the
schoolmistress
and
the
clerics
but
this
was
only
done
by
way
of
eliciting
some
general
information
for
no
clerk
was
present
to
record
a
formal
interrogatory
those
copies
marc
replied
used
currently
in
all
the
schools
in
the
secular
ones
as
well
as
in
those
of
the
religious
orders
this
was
confirmed
by
brother
fulgence
so
said
he
ones
would
be
found
at
our
school
even
as
there
must
be
some
here
la
bissonnière
however
desired
more
precise
information
do
you
remember
having
placed
this
one
in
the
hands
of
any
of
your
pupils
he
asked
simon
words
love
one
another
must
have
struck
you
copy
was
never
used
here
simon
answered
flatly
you
point
out
monsieur
i
should
have
recollected
it
the
same
question
was
then
addressed
to
brother
fulgence
who
at
first
evinced
some
little
hesitation
have
three
brothers
with
me
brothers
isidore
lazarus
and
gorgias
he
replied
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
avouch
anything
then
in
the
deep
silence
which
was
falling
he
added
no
no
that
copy
was
never
used
at
our
school
for
it
would
have
come
before
me
the
magistrates
did
not
insist
on
the
point
for
the
time
being
they
did
not
wish
the
importance
which
they
attached
to
the
slip
to
become
too
manifest
they
expressed
their
surprise
however
that
the
missing
corner
of
it
had
not
been
found
not
these
slips
sometimes
bear
in
one
corner
a
stamp
of
the
school
to
which
they
belong
daix
inquired
brother
fulgence
had
to
admit
that
it
was
so
but
marc
protested
that
he
had
never
stamped
any
used
in
his
school
me
declared
simon
in
his
tranquil
way
have
some
slips
here
on
which
a
stamp
would
be
found
but
i
stamp
them
down
below
here
perceiving
the
perplexity
of
the
magistrates
father
philibin
hitherto
silent
and
attentive
indulged
in
a
light
laugh
shows
he
said
difficult
it
is
to
arrive
at
the
truth
by
the
way
monsieur
le
procureur
de
la
république
matters
are
much
the
same
with
the
stain
which
you
are
now
examining
one
of
us
fancied
it
to
be
some
initialling
a
kind
of
flourish
but
for
my
part
i
believe
it
to
be
a
blot
which
some
pupil
tried
to
efface
with
his
finger
it
usual
for
the
masters
to
initial
the
asked
daix
brother
fulgence
acknowledged
is
done
at
our
school
no
cried
simon
and
marc
in
unison
never
do
it
in
the
communal
schools
are
mistaken
said
mademoiselle
rouzaire
although
i
do
not
stamp
my
copies
i
have
sometimes
initialled
them
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
la
bissonnière
stopped
the
discussion
for
he
knew
by
experience
what
a
muddle
is
reached
when
one
enters
into
secondary
questions
of
personal
habits
the
the
missing
corner
of
it
the
possible
existence
of
a
stamp
and
a
paraph
would
all
have
to
be
studied
in
the
course
of
the
investigation
for
the
moment
he
now
contented
himself
with
asking
the
witnesses
to
relate
how
the
crime
had
been
discovered
mignot
had
to
say
that
the
open
window
had
attracted
his
attention
and
that
he
had
raised
an
outcry
on
perceiving
the
victim
body
mademoiselle
rouzaire
explained
how
she
had
hastened
to
the
spot
and
how
on
the
previous
evening
she
had
brought
zéphirin
home
from
the
capuchin
chapel
when
he
had
sprung
into
the
room
by
the
window
father
philibin
and
brother
fulgence
in
their
turn
related
how
chance
had
connected
them
with
the
tragedy
in
what
condition
they
had
found
the
room
and
in
what
particular
spot
they
had
discovered
the
paper
gag
which
they
had
merely
unfolded
before
placing
it
on
the
table
finally
marc
indicated
a
few
observations
which
he
had
made
on
his
arrival
subsequent
to
that
of
the
others
la
bissonnière
thereupon
turned
to
simon
and
began
to
question
him
have
told
us
that
you
came
home
at
twenty
minutes
to
twelve
and
that
the
whole
house
then
seemed
to
you
to
be
perfectly
quiet
your
wife
was
asleep
at
this
point
daix
interrupted
his
superior
le
procureur
said
he
it
not
advisable
that
madame
simon
should
be
present
could
she
not
come
down
here
a
moment
la
bissonnière
nodded
assent
and
simon
went
to
fetch
his
wife
who
soon
made
her
appearance
rachel
attired
in
a
plain
morning
wrap
of
unbleached
linen
looked
so
beautiful
as
she
entered
the
room
amidst
the
deep
silence
that
a
little
quiver
of
admiration
and
tender
sympathy
sped
by
hers
was
the
jewish
beauty
in
its
flower
a
delightfully
oval
face
splendid
black
hair
a
gilded
skin
large
caressing
eyes
and
a
red
mouth
with
speckless
dazzling
teeth
and
one
could
tell
that
she
was
all
love
a
trifle
indolent
living
in
seclusion
in
her
home
with
her
husband
and
her
children
like
a
woman
of
the
east
in
her
little
secret
garden
simon
was
about
to
close
the
door
behind
her
when
the
two
children
joseph
and
sarah
four
and
two
years
old
respectively
and
both
of
them
strong
and
flourishing
ran
in
although
they
had
been
forbidden
to
come
downstairs
and
they
sought
refuge
in
the
folds
of
their
wrap
where
the
magistrates
by
a
gesture
intimated
they
might
remain
the
gallant
la
bissonnière
moved
by
the
sight
of
such
great
beauty
imparted
a
accent
to
his
voice
as
he
asked
rachel
a
few
questions
was
twenty
minutes
to
twelve
madame
was
it
not
when
your
husband
came
home
monsieur
he
looked
at
the
clock
and
he
was
in
bed
and
we
were
still
chatting
in
an
undertone
and
with
the
light
out
in
order
that
the
children
might
not
be
roused
when
we
heard
midnight
strike
before
your
husband
arrival
madame
between
ten
and
eleven
did
you
hear
nothing
no
footsteps
nor
talking
no
sounds
of
struggling
nor
stifled
cries
absolutely
nothing
monsieur
i
was
asleep
it
was
my
entry
into
our
room
which
awoke
me
he
had
left
me
feeling
poorly
and
he
was
so
pleased
to
find
me
better
that
he
began
to
laugh
as
he
kissed
me
and
i
made
him
keep
quiet
for
fear
lest
the
others
should
be
disturbed
so
deep
was
the
silence
around
us
ah
how
could
we
have
imagined
that
such
a
frightful
misfortune
had
fallen
on
the
house
she
was
thoroughly
upset
and
tears
coursed
down
her
cheeks
while
she
turned
towards
her
husband
as
if
for
consolation
and
support
and
he
weeping
now
at
the
sight
of
her
grief
and
forgetting
where
he
was
caught
her
passionately
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
with
infinite
tenderness
the
two
children
raised
their
heads
anxiously
there
was
a
moment
of
deep
emotion
and
compassionate
kindliness
in
which
all
participated
was
rather
surprised
at
the
time
because
there
is
no
train
at
that
hour
resumed
madame
simon
of
her
own
accord
when
my
husband
was
in
bed
he
told
me
how
it
happened
simon
explained
could
not
do
otherwise
than
attend
that
banquet
but
when
on
reaching
the
station
at
beaumont
i
saw
the
ten
train
steaming
away
before
my
eyes
i
felt
so
annoyed
that
i
would
not
wait
for
the
train
at
midnight
but
set
out
on
foot
at
once
a
walk
of
less
than
four
miles
is
nothing
to
speak
of
the
night
was
very
beautiful
very
warm
about
one
when
the
storm
burst
i
was
still
talking
softly
to
my
wife
telling
her
how
i
had
spent
my
evening
for
she
could
not
get
to
sleep
again
it
was
that
which
kept
us
late
in
bed
this
morning
ignorant
of
the
dreadful
blow
that
had
fallen
on
us
then
as
rachel
began
to
weep
again
he
once
more
kissed
her
like
a
lover
and
like
a
father
my
darling
calm
yourself
we
loved
the
poor
little
fellow
with
all
our
hearts
and
we
have
no
cause
for
in
this
abominable
catastrophe
that
was
also
the
opinion
of
the
onlookers
darras
the
mayor
professed
great
esteem
for
the
zealous
and
honest
schoolmaster
simon
mignot
and
mademoiselle
rouzaire
although
by
no
means
fond
of
the
jews
shared
the
opinion
that
this
one
at
all
events
strove
by
irreproachable
conduct
to
obtain
forgiveness
for
his
birth
father
philibin
and
brother
fulgence
on
their
side
in
presence
of
the
general
sentiment
of
the
others
affected
neutrality
remaining
apart
and
preserving
silence
while
with
keen
eyes
they
scrutinised
people
and
things
the
magistrates
thrown
back
on
the
theory
of
some
stranger
who
must
have
entered
and
left
the
boy
room
by
the
window
had
to
rest
content
with
this
first
verification
of
the
facts
only
one
point
as
yet
was
clearly
established
the
hour
of
the
crime
which
must
have
been
perpetrated
between
ten
and
eleven
as
for
the
crime
itself
it
remained
engulfed
in
darkness
leaving
the
authorities
who
had
certain
details
to
settle
marc
after
embracing
simon
in
brotherly
fashion
was
desirous
of
going
home
to
lunch
the
scene
between
the
husband
and
the
wife
had
taught
him
nothing
for
he
well
knew
how
tenderly
they
loved
each
other
but
tears
had
come
to
his
eyes
he
had
been
deeply
stirred
by
the
sight
of
such
dolorous
affection
noon
was
about
to
strike
at
martin
church
when
he
again
found
himself
on
the
square
which
was
now
blocked
by
such
an
increasing
crowd
that
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
open
a
way
as
the
news
of
the
crime
spread
folk
arrived
from
all
directions
pressing
towards
the
closed
window
which
the
two
gendarmes
could
hardly
defend
and
the
horribly
exaggerated
accounts
of
the
affair
which
circulated
through
the
crowd
raised
its
indignation
to
fever
heat
and
made
it
growl
wrathfully
marc
had
just
freed
himself
from
the
throng
when
a
priest
approached
him
and
inquired
you
come
from
the
school
monsieur
froment
are
all
these
horrible
things
which
people
are
repeating
true
the
questioner
was
abbé
quandieu
priest
of
martin
the
parish
church
years
old
tall
and
robust
the
abbé
had
a
gentle
kindly
face
with
light
blue
eyes
round
cheeks
and
a
soft
chin
marc
had
met
him
at
madame
duparque
for
he
was
the
old
lady
confessor
and
friend
and
though
the
schoolmaster
was
not
fond
of
priests
he
felt
some
esteem
for
this
one
knowing
that
he
was
tolerant
and
reasonable
possessed
too
of
more
feeling
than
real
mental
ability
in
a
few
words
marc
recounted
the
facts
of
the
case
which
were
already
sufficiently
horrid
poor
monsieur
simon
said
the
priest
compassionately
deeply
grieved
he
must
be
for
he
was
very
much
attached
to
his
nephew
and
behaved
very
well
in
regard
to
him
i
have
had
proof
of
it
this
spontaneous
testimony
pleased
marc
who
remained
conversing
with
the
priest
for
another
minute
but
a
capuchin
father
drew
near
father
théodose
the
superior
of
the
little
community
attached
to
the
neighbouring
chapel
superbly
built
having
also
a
handsome
face
with
large
ardent
eyes
and
a
splendid
dark
beard
which
rendered
him
quite
majestic
father
théodose
was
a
confessor
of
repute
and
a
preacher
of
a
mystical
turn
whose
glowing
accents
attracted
all
the
devout
women
of
maillebois
though
he
was
covertly
waging
war
against
abbé
quandieu
he
affected
in
his
presence
the
deferential
manner
of
a
younger
and
more
humbly
situated
servant
of
providence
he
immediately
gave
expression
to
his
emotion
and
his
grief
for
he
had
noticed
the
poor
child
he
said
at
the
chapel
on
the
previous
evening
so
pious
a
child
he
was
a
little
angel
with
a
cherub
fair
curly
locks
but
marc
did
not
tarry
to
listen
for
the
capuchin
inspired
him
with
unconquerable
distrust
and
antipathy
so
he
turned
his
steps
homeward
but
all
at
once
he
was
again
stopped
this
time
by
a
friendly
tap
on
the
shoulder
férou
are
you
at
maillebois
he
exclaimed
the
man
whom
he
addressed
by
the
name
of
férou
was
schoolmaster
at
le
moreau
a
lonely
hamlet
some
two
and
a
half
miles
from
jonville
the
little
place
had
not
even
a
priest
of
its
own
but
was
looked
after
from
the
religious
standpoint
by
the
jonville
priest
abbé
cognasse
férou
there
led
a
life
of
black
misery
with
his
wife
and
his
children
three
girls
he
was
a
big
fellow
of
thirty
whose
clothes
always
seemed
too
short
for
him
his
dark
hair
bristled
on
his
long
and
bony
head
he
had
a
bumpy
nose
a
wide
mouth
and
a
projecting
chin
and
knew
not
what
to
do
with
his
big
feet
and
his
big
hands
know
very
well
that
my
wife
aunt
keeps
a
grocery
shop
here
he
answered
came
over
to
see
her
but
i
say
what
an
abominable
business
this
is
about
the
poor
little
hunchback
wo
it
just
enable
those
dirty
priests
to
belabour
us
and
say
that
we
pervert
and
poison
the
young
marc
regarded
férou
as
a
very
intelligent
man
whom
a
confined
life
full
of
privations
had
embittered
to
the
point
of
violence
and
inspired
with
ideas
of
revenge
the
virulence
of
the
remark
he
had
just
made
disturbed
marc
who
rejoined
us
i
do
see
what
we
have
to
do
with
it
you
are
a
simpleton
férou
retorted
do
understand
that
species
but
you
will
soon
see
the
good
fathers
and
the
dear
brothers
all
the
black
gowns
hard
at
work
have
they
already
allowed
it
to
be
surmised
that
simon
himself
strangled
his
nephew
at
this
marc
lost
his
temper
férou
hatred
of
the
church
led
him
too
far
are
out
of
your
senses
said
marc
suspects
nobody
for
one
moment
would
dare
to
suspect
simon
all
acknowledge
his
integrity
and
kindliness
even
abbé
quandieu
told
me
a
moment
ago
that
he
had
had
proof
of
his
fatherly
treatment
of
the
poor
victim
férou
lean
and
lanky
figure
was
shaken
by
a
convulsive
laugh
his
hair
seemed
to
bristle
yet
higher
on
his
equine
head
it
too
amusing
he
replied
you
fancy
they
will
restrain
themselves
when
a
dirty
jew
is
in
question
does
a
dirty
jew
deserve
to
have
the
truth
told
about
him
your
friend
quandieu
and
all
the
others
will
say
whatever
may
be
desirable
if
it
is
necessary
that
the
dirty
jew
should
be
found
guilty
thanks
to
the
complicity
of
us
others
the
scamps
who
know
neither
god
nor
country
and
who
corrupt
the
children
of
france
for
that
is
what
the
priests
say
of
us
you
know
it
well
then
as
marc
chilled
to
the
heart
continued
to
protest
férou
resumed
yet
more
vehemently
you
know
what
goes
on
at
le
moreux
i
starve
there
i
treated
with
contempt
pressed
down
even
lower
than
the
wretched
when
abbé
cognasse
comes
over
to
say
mass
he
spit
on
me
if
he
met
me
and
if
i
do
eat
bread
every
day
it
simply
because
i
refused
to
sing
in
the
choir
and
ring
the
church
bell
you
know
abbé
cognasse
yourself
you
have
managed
to
check
him
at
jonville
since
you
contrived
to
get
the
mayor
over
to
your
side
but
none
the
less
you
are
always
at
war
he
would
devour
you
if
you
only
gave
him
the
chance
a
village
schoolmaster
indeed
why
everybody
beast
of
burden
everybody
lackey
a
man
without
caste
an
arrant
failure
and
the
peasants
distrust
him
and
the
priests
would
like
to
burn
him
alive
in
order
to
ensure
the
undivided
reign
of
the
church
catechism
throughout
the
country
he
went
on
bitterly
enumerating
the
sufferings
of
those
damned
ones
as
he
called
the
elementary
teachers
he
himself
a
shepherd
son
successful
at
the
village
school
which
he
had
attended
and
afterwards
a
student
at
the
training
college
which
he
had
quitted
with
excellent
certificates
had
always
suffered
from
lack
of
means
for
in
a
spirit
of
rectitude
after
some
trouble
with
a
shop
girl
at
maillebois
when
he
was
there
he
had
foolishly
married
her
although
she
was
as
poor
as
himself
but
was
marc
any
happier
at
jonville
even
though
his
wife
received
frequent
presents
from
her
grandmother
was
he
not
always
struggling
with
indebtedness
struggling
too
with
the
priest
in
order
to
retain
dignity
and
independence
true
he
was
seconded
by
mademoiselle
mazeline
the
mistress
of
the
girls
school
a
woman
of
firm
sense
with
an
inexhaustible
heart
who
had
helped
him
to
win
over
the
parish
council
and
gradually
the
whole
commune
but
circumstances
had
been
in
his
favour
and
the
example
was
perhaps
unique
in
the
department
on
the
other
hand
the
state
of
affairs
at
maillebois
completed
the
picture
there
on
one
side
one
found
mademoiselle
rouzaire
won
over
to
the
cause
of
the
priests
and
the
monks
learning
to
take
her
pupils
to
church
and
fulfilling
so
well
the
office
of
the
nuns
that
it
had
been
considered
unnecessary
to
install
a
nuns
school
in
the
little
town
then
on
the
other
hand
there
was
that
poor
fellow
simon
an
honest
man
certainly
but
one
who
from
fear
of
being
treated
as
a
dirty
jew
tried
circumspection
with
everybody
allowing
his
nephew
to
be
educated
by
the
dear
brothers
and
bowing
down
to
the
ground
before
all
the
rooks
who
infested
the
country
dirty
jew
cried
férou
with
emphasis
by
way
of
conclusion
is
and
always
will
be
a
dirty
jew
and
to
be
both
a
schoolmaster
and
a
jew
beats
everything
ah
well
you
see
you
see
then
with
impetuous
gestures
which
shook
the
whole
of
his
big
loose
frame
he
took
himself
off
and
mingled
with
the
crowd
marc
had
remained
on
the
kerb
of
the
footway
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
regarding
férou
as
a
for
the
picture
which
he
had
drawn
seemed
to
him
full
of
exaggeration
but
of
what
use
was
it
to
answer
that
poor
fellow
whose
brain
would
soon
be
turned
by
ill
luck
yet
marc
was
haunted
by
what
he
had
heard
and
grew
vaguely
anxious
as
he
resumed
his
walk
towards
the
place
des
capucins
it
was
a
quarter
past
twelve
when
he
reached
the
little
house
and
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
ladies
had
been
awaiting
him
in
the
where
the
table
was
already
laid
this
fresh
delay
had
quite
upset
madame
duparque
she
said
nothing
but
the
brusqueness
with
which
she
sat
down
and
nervously
unfolded
her
napkin
denoted
how
culpable
she
considered
this
lack
of
punctuality
must
apologise
the
young
man
explained
i
had
to
wait
for
the
magistrates
and
there
was
such
a
crowd
on
the
square
afterwards
that
i
could
not
pass
at
this
although
the
grandmother
was
resolved
on
silence
she
could
not
restrain
an
exclamation
hope
that
you
are
not
going
to
busy
yourself
with
that
abominable
affair
marc
merely
answered
certainly
hope
i
have
to
do
so
unless
it
be
as
a
matter
of
duty
when
pélagie
had
served
an
omelet
and
some
slices
of
grilled
mutton
with
mashed
potatoes
the
young
man
related
all
that
he
had
learnt
geneviève
listened
to
his
story
quivering
with
horror
and
pity
while
madame
berthereau
who
was
also
greatly
moved
battled
with
her
tears
and
glanced
furtively
at
madame
duparque
as
if
to
ascertain
how
far
she
might
allow
her
sensibility
to
go
but
the
old
lady
had
relapsed
into
silent
disapproval
of
everything
which
seemed
to
her
contrary
to
her
rule
of
life
she
ate
steadily
and
it
was
only
after
a
time
that
she
remarked
remember
very
well
that
a
child
disappeared
at
beaumont
during
my
youth
it
was
found
under
the
porch
of
maxence
the
body
was
cut
in
quarters
and
there
was
only
the
heart
missing
it
was
said
that
the
jews
required
the
heart
for
the
unleavened
bread
of
their
passover
marc
looked
at
her
in
amazement
are
not
serious
grandmother
you
surely
do
believe
such
a
stupid
and
infamous
charge
she
turned
her
cold
clear
eyes
on
him
and
instead
of
giving
a
direct
answer
she
said
is
simply
an
old
recollection
which
came
back
to
me
of
course
i
accuse
nobody
at
this
pélagie
who
had
just
brought
the
dessert
ventured
to
join
in
the
conversation
with
the
familiarity
of
an
old
servant
is
quite
right
of
madame
to
accuse
nobody
and
others
ought
to
follow
example
the
neighbourhood
has
been
in
a
state
of
revolution
since
this
morning
you
can
have
no
idea
of
the
frightful
stories
which
are
being
told
just
now
too
i
heard
a
workman
say
that
the
brothers
school
ought
to
be
burnt
down
deep
silence
followed
those
words
marc
struck
by
them
made
a
gesture
then
restrained
himself
like
one
who
prefers
to
keep
his
thoughts
to
himself
and
pélagie
continued
will
let
me
go
to
the
distribution
of
prizes
this
afternoon
i
hope
i
do
think
my
nephew
polydor
will
have
a
prize
but
it
would
please
me
to
be
present
those
good
brothers
it
wo
be
a
happy
festival
for
them
falling
on
the
very
day
when
one
of
their
best
pupils
has
been
killed
madame
duparque
nodded
assent
to
the
servant
request
and
the
conversation
was
then
turned
into
another
channel
indeed
the
end
of
the
meal
was
brightened
somewhat
by
the
laughter
of
little
louise
who
gazed
in
astonishment
at
the
grave
faces
of
her
father
and
her
mother
who
usually
smiled
so
brightly
this
led
to
some
relaxation
of
the
tension
and
for
a
moment
they
all
chatted
in
a
cordial
intimate
way
the
distribution
of
prizes
at
the
brothers
school
that
afternoon
roused
great
emotion
never
before
had
the
ceremony
attracted
such
a
throng
true
the
circumstance
that
it
was
presided
over
by
father
philibin
the
prefect
of
the
studies
at
the
college
of
valmarie
made
it
particularly
notable
the
rector
of
that
college
father
crabot
who
was
famous
for
his
society
influence
and
the
powerful
part
he
was
said
to
play
in
contemporary
politics
also
attended
desirous
as
he
was
of
giving
the
brothers
a
public
mark
of
his
esteem
further
there
was
a
reactionary
deputy
of
the
department
count
hector
de
sanglebœuf
the
owner
of
la
désirade
a
splendid
estate
of
the
environs
which
with
a
few
millions
had
formed
the
marriage
portion
of
his
wife
a
daughter
of
baron
nathan
the
great
jew
banker
however
that
which
excited
everybody
and
which
drew
to
the
usually
quiet
and
deserted
place
des
capucins
such
a
feverish
crowd
was
the
monstrous
crime
discovered
in
the
morning
the
murder
of
one
of
the
brothers
pupils
under
the
most
abominable
circumstances
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
murdered
boy
were
present
as
if
only
he
were
there
in
the
shady
courtyard
where
the
platform
was
set
up
beyond
the
serried
rows
of
chairs
while
father
philibin
spoke
in
praise
of
the
school
of
its
director
the
distinguished
brother
fulgence
and
of
his
three
assistants
brothers
isidore
lazarus
and
gorgias
the
haunting
sensation
became
yet
more
intense
when
the
was
read
by
the
a
thin
knotty
man
showing
a
low
harsh
brow
under
his
frizzy
black
hair
a
big
nose
projecting
like
an
eagle
beak
between
his
prominent
and
thin
lips
which
in
parting
revealed
teeth
zéphirin
had
been
the
best
scholar
of
his
class
every
prize
of
which
he
had
won
thus
his
name
recurred
incessantly
and
brother
gorgias
in
his
long
black
cassock
on
which
the
ends
of
his
showed
like
a
splotch
of
white
let
that
name
fall
from
his
lips
in
such
slow
lugubrious
fashion
that
on
each
occasion
a
quiver
of
growing
intensity
sped
through
the
assembled
throng
every
time
the
poor
little
dead
boy
was
called
he
seemed
to
rise
up
to
receive
his
crown
and
his
book
but
alas
crowns
and
books
alike
formed
an
increasing
pile
on
the
table
and
nothing
could
be
more
poignant
than
the
silence
and
the
void
to
which
so
many
prizes
were
cast
the
prizes
of
that
model
pupil
who
had
vanished
so
tragically
and
whose
lamentable
remains
were
lying
only
a
few
doors
away
at
last
the
emotion
of
the
onlookers
became
too
great
to
be
restrained
sobs
burst
forth
while
brother
gorgias
continued
to
call
that
name
with
a
twitching
of
the
habitual
to
him
which
disclosed
some
of
the
teeth
on
the
left
side
of
his
mouth
amid
an
involuntary
grin
suggestive
of
both
scorn
and
cruelty
the
function
ended
amid
general
uneasiness
however
fine
might
be
the
assembly
which
had
hastened
thither
to
exalt
the
brothers
anxiety
increased
disquietude
swept
over
all
as
if
some
menace
had
come
from
afar
but
the
worst
was
the
departure
amid
the
murmurs
and
the
covert
curses
of
numerous
groups
of
artisans
and
peasants
gathered
on
the
square
the
abominable
stories
of
which
pélagie
had
spoken
circulated
through
that
quivering
crowd
a
horrid
story
which
had
been
stifled
the
previous
year
the
story
of
a
brother
whom
his
superiors
had
conjured
away
to
save
him
from
the
assize
court
was
repeated
all
sorts
of
rumours
had
been
current
since
that
time
rumours
of
abominations
of
terrified
children
who
dared
not
speak
out
naturally
there
had
been
much
enlargement
of
those
mysterious
rumours
as
they
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
the
indignation
of
the
folk
assembled
on
the
square
came
from
the
revival
of
them
which
was
prompted
by
the
murder
of
one
of
the
brothers
pupils
accusations
were
already
taking
shape
words
of
vengeance
spread
around
would
the
guilty
one
again
be
allowed
to
escape
would
that
vile
and
bloody
den
never
be
closed
thus
as
the
fine
folk
departed
and
particularly
when
the
robes
of
the
monks
and
the
cassocks
of
the
priests
were
seen
fists
were
stretched
out
and
menaces
of
death
arose
the
whole
of
one
group
of
onlookers
pursuing
with
hisses
fathers
crabot
and
philibin
as
they
hurried
away
pale
and
anxious
while
brother
fulgence
ordered
the
to
be
strongly
bolted
marc
out
of
curiosity
had
watched
the
scene
from
a
window
of
madame
duparque
little
house
and
becoming
keenly
interested
in
it
he
had
even
gone
for
a
moment
to
the
threshold
in
order
that
he
might
see
and
hear
the
better
how
ridiculous
had
been
férou
prophecy
that
the
jew
would
be
saddled
with
the
crime
that
the
rancorous
black
gowns
would
make
a
scapegoat
of
the
secular
schoolmaster
far
from
things
taking
that
course
it
seemed
as
though
they
might
turn
out
very
badly
for
the
good
brothers
the
rising
wrath
of
the
crowd
those
menaces
of
death
indicated
that
matters
might
go
very
far
indeed
that
the
popular
anger
might
spread
from
the
one
guilty
man
to
the
whole
of
his
congregation
and
shake
the
very
church
itself
in
the
region
if
indeed
the
guilty
man
were
one
of
its
ministers
marc
questioned
himself
on
that
point
but
could
form
no
absolute
conviction
indeed
even
suspicion
seemed
to
him
hazardous
and
wrong
the
demeanour
of
father
philibin
and
brother
fulgence
had
appeared
quite
natural
full
of
perfect
tranquillity
and
he
strove
to
be
very
tolerant
and
just
for
fear
lest
he
might
yield
to
his
impulses
as
a
freethinker
delivered
from
belief
in
dogmas
all
was
dark
in
that
terrible
tragedy
and
he
resolved
to
wait
until
he
should
learn
more
but
while
he
stood
there
he
saw
pélagie
returning
in
her
accompanied
by
her
nephew
polydor
souquet
a
lad
of
eleven
who
carried
a
handsomely
bound
book
under
his
arm
the
good
conduct
prize
monsieur
exclaimed
the
servant
proudly
is
even
better
than
a
prize
for
reading
or
writing
is
it
not
the
truth
was
that
polydor
sly
but
torpid
astonished
even
the
brothers
by
his
prodigious
idleness
he
was
a
pale
sturdy
boy
with
very
light
hair
and
a
long
dull
face
the
son
of
a
addicted
to
drink
he
had
lost
his
mother
at
an
early
age
and
lived
chancewise
nowadays
while
his
father
broke
stones
on
the
roads
hating
every
kind
of
work
terrified
particularly
by
the
idea
of
having
to
break
stones
in
his
turn
he
allowed
his
aunt
to
indulge
in
the
dream
of
seeing
him
become
a
brother
invariably
agreeing
with
everything
she
said
and
often
visiting
her
in
her
kitchen
in
the
hope
thereby
of
securing
some
dainty
morsel
pélagie
however
in
spite
of
her
delight
was
affected
by
the
uproar
on
the
square
she
at
last
looked
round
quivering
and
cast
a
glance
of
fury
and
defiance
at
the
crowd
hear
them
monsieur
she
exclaimed
hear
those
anarchists
the
idea
of
it
such
devoted
brothers
who
are
so
fond
of
their
pupils
who
look
after
them
with
such
motherly
care
for
instance
there
polydor
he
lives
with
his
father
on
the
road
to
jonville
nearly
a
mile
away
well
last
night
after
that
ceremony
for
fear
of
a
mishap
brother
gorgias
accompanied
him
to
his
very
door
is
that
not
so
polydor
the
boy
answered
laconically
in
his
husky
voice
folk
insult
and
threaten
the
brothers
the
servant
resumed
wicked
you
can
picture
poor
brother
gorgias
taking
that
long
walk
in
the
dark
night
in
order
that
nothing
might
befall
this
little
man
ah
it
enough
to
disgust
one
of
being
prudent
and
kind
marc
who
had
been
scrutinising
the
boy
was
struck
by
his
resolute
taciturnity
by
the
hypocritical
somnolence
in
which
he
seemed
to
find
a
pleasant
refuge
he
listened
no
further
to
pélagie
to
whose
chatter
he
never
accorded
much
attention
but
on
returning
to
the
little
where
he
had
left
his
wife
reading
while
madame
duparque
and
madame
berthereau
turned
to
their
everlasting
knitting
for
some
religious
charities
he
felt
anxious
for
he
perceived
that
geneviève
had
laid
her
book
aside
and
was
gazing
with
much
emotion
at
the
tumult
on
the
square
she
came
to
him
and
with
an
affectionate
impulse
fraught
with
alarm
looking
extremely
pretty
in
her
agitation
she
almost
threw
herself
upon
his
neck
is
happening
she
asked
they
going
to
fight
he
began
to
reassure
her
and
all
at
once
madame
duparque
raising
her
eyes
from
her
work
sternly
gave
expression
to
her
will
i
hope
that
you
will
not
mix
yourself
up
in
that
horrid
affair
what
madness
it
is
to
suspect
and
insult
the
brothers
god
will
end
by
avenging
his
ministers
ii
marc
was
unable
to
get
to
sleep
that
night
for
he
was
haunted
by
the
events
of
the
day
by
that
monstrous
mysterious
puzzling
crime
thus
while
geneviève
his
wife
reposed
quietly
beside
him
he
dwelt
in
thought
upon
each
incident
of
the
affair
classified
each
detail
striving
to
pierce
the
darkness
and
establish
the
truth
marc
mind
was
one
that
sought
logic
and
light
his
clear
and
firm
judgment
demanded
in
all
things
a
basis
of
certainty
thence
came
his
absolute
passion
for
truth
in
his
eyes
no
rest
of
mind
no
real
happiness
was
possible
without
complete
decisive
certainty
he
was
not
very
learned
but
such
things
as
he
knew
he
wished
to
know
completely
in
order
that
he
might
have
no
doubt
of
the
possession
of
the
truth
experimental
truth
established
for
ever
all
unrest
came
to
an
end
when
doubt
ceased
he
then
fully
recovered
his
spirits
and
to
his
passion
for
the
acquirement
of
truth
was
added
one
for
imparting
it
to
others
for
driving
it
into
the
brains
and
hearts
of
all
his
marvellous
gifts
then
became
manifest
he
brought
with
him
a
methodical
power
which
simplified
classified
illumined
everything
his
quiet
conviction
imposed
itself
on
his
hearers
light
was
shed
on
dim
notions
things
seemed
easy
and
simple
he
instilled
life
into
the
driest
subjects
he
succeeded
in
imparting
a
passionate
interest
even
to
grammar
and
arithmetic
rendering
them
as
interesting
as
stories
to
his
pupils
in
him
one
really
found
the
born
teacher
he
had
discovered
that
he
possessed
that
teaching
gift
at
the
time
when
already
possessed
of
a
bachelor
degree
he
had
come
to
beaumont
to
finish
his
apprenticeship
as
a
lithographic
draughtsman
in
the
establishment
of
entrusted
with
the
execution
of
many
school
diagrams
he
had
exercised
his
ingenuity
in
simplifying
them
creating
perfect
masterpieces
of
clearness
and
precision
which
had
revealed
to
him
his
true
vocation
the
happiness
that
he
found
in
teaching
the
young
it
was
at
establishment
also
that
he
had
first
met
salvan
now
director
of
the
training
college
who
observing
his
bent
had
approved
of
the
course
he
took
in
yielding
to
it
completely
and
becoming
what
he
was
a
humble
elementary
schoolmaster
who
convinced
of
the
noble
usefulness
of
his
duties
was
happy
to
discharge
them
even
in
a
small
and
lonely
village
marc
affection
for
those
whose
narrow
and
slumbering
minds
required
awakening
and
expansion
had
decided
his
career
and
in
the
discharge
of
his
modest
functions
his
passion
for
truth
increased
becoming
a
more
and
more
imperious
craving
it
ended
indeed
by
constituting
the
of
his
health
his
very
life
for
it
was
only
by
satisfying
it
that
he
enjoyed
normal
life
when
it
escaped
him
he
fell
into
anguish
of
spirit
consumed
by
his
desire
to
acquire
and
possess
it
wholly
in
order
that
he
might
communicate
it
to
others
failing
which
he
spent
his
days
in
intolerable
suffering
often
physical
as
well
as
mental
from
this
passion
assuredly
sprang
the
torment
which
kept
marc
awake
that
night
by
the
side
of
his
sleeping
wife
he
suffered
from
his
ignorance
his
failure
to
penetrate
the
truth
respecting
the
murder
of
that
child
he
was
not
confronted
merely
by
an
ignoble
crime
he
divined
behind
it
the
existence
of
dark
and
threatening
depths
some
dim
but
yawning
abyss
would
his
sufferings
continue
then
as
long
as
he
should
not
know
the
truth
which
perchance
he
might
never
know
for
the
shadows
seemed
to
increase
at
each
effort
that
he
made
to
dissipate
them
mastered
by
uncertainty
and
fear
he
ended
by
longing
for
daybreak
in
order
that
he
might
resume
his
investigations
but
his
wife
laughed
lightly
in
her
sleep
some
happy
dream
no
doubt
had
come
to
her
and
then
the
terrible
old
grandmother
seemed
to
rise
up
before
the
young
man
eyes
and
repeat
that
he
must
on
no
account
meddle
in
that
horrible
affair
at
this
the
certainty
of
a
conflict
with
his
wife
relations
appeared
to
him
and
brought
his
hesitation
and
unhappiness
to
a
climax
hitherto
he
had
experienced
no
serious
trouble
with
that
devout
family
whence
he
who
held
no
religious
belief
whatever
had
taken
the
young
girl
who
had
become
his
wife
his
life
companion
he
did
not
carry
tolerance
so
far
as
to
follow
his
wife
to
mass
as
berthereau
had
done
but
he
had
allowed
his
daughter
louise
to
be
baptised
in
order
that
he
might
have
some
peace
with
the
ladies
besides
as
his
wife
in
her
adoration
for
him
had
ceased
to
follow
the
religious
observances
of
her
church
soon
after
the
marriage
no
quarrel
had
yet
arisen
between
them
occasionally
he
remarked
in
geneviève
some
revival
of
her
long
catholic
training
ideas
of
the
absolute
which
clashed
with
his
own
superstitions
which
sent
a
chill
to
his
heart
but
these
were
merely
passing
incidents
he
believed
that
the
love
which
bound
him
to
his
wife
was
strong
enough
to
triumph
over
such
divergencies
for
did
they
not
soon
find
themselves
in
each
other
arms
again
even
when
they
had
momentarily
felt
themselves
to
be
strangers
belonging
to
different
worlds
geneviève
had
been
one
of
the
best
pupils
of
the
sisters
of
the
visitation
she
had
quitted
their
establishment
with
a
superior
certificate
in
such
wise
that
her
first
idea
had
been
to
become
a
teacher
herself
but
there
was
no
place
for
her
at
jonville
where
the
excellent
mademoiselle
mazeline
managed
the
girls
school
without
assistance
and
naturally
enough
she
had
been
unwilling
to
quit
her
husband
then
household
duties
had
taken
possession
of
her
now
also
she
had
to
attend
to
her
little
girl
and
thus
all
thought
of
realising
her
early
desire
was
postponed
perhaps
for
ever
but
did
not
this
very
circumstance
make
their
life
all
happiness
and
perfect
agreement
far
from
the
reach
of
storms
if
from
concern
for
their
future
happiness
the
worthy
salvan
berthereau
faithful
friend
to
whom
the
marriage
was
due
had
for
a
moment
thought
of
trying
to
check
the
irresistible
love
by
which
the
young
people
were
transported
he
must
have
felt
reassured
on
finding
them
still
tenderly
united
after
three
years
of
matrimony
it
was
only
now
while
the
wife
dreamt
happily
in
her
slumber
that
the
husband
for
the
first
time
experienced
anxiety
at
the
thought
of
the
case
of
conscience
before
him
foreseeing
as
he
did
that
a
quarrel
might
well
arise
with
his
wife
relations
and
that
all
sorts
of
unpleasant
consequences
might
ensue
in
his
home
should
he
yield
to
his
imperative
craving
for
truth
at
last
however
he
dozed
off
and
ended
by
sleeping
soundly
in
the
morning
when
his
eyes
opened
to
the
clear
bright
light
he
felt
astonished
at
having
passed
through
such
a
vigil
it
had
assuredly
been
caused
by
the
haunting
influence
of
that
frightful
crime
to
which
as
it
happened
geneviève
still
full
of
emotion
and
pity
was
the
first
to
refer
again
simon
must
be
in
great
distress
she
said
can
not
abandon
him
i
think
that
you
ought
to
see
him
this
morning
and
place
yourself
at
his
disposal
marc
embraced
her
delighted
to
find
her
so
and
brave
grandmother
will
get
angry
again
he
replied
our
life
here
will
become
unbearable
geneviève
laughed
lightly
and
gently
shrugged
her
shoulders
grandmother
would
quarrel
with
the
very
angels
she
retorted
one
does
half
what
she
desires
one
does
quite
enough
this
sally
enlivened
them
both
and
louise
having
awoke
they
spent
a
few
delightful
moments
in
playing
with
her
in
her
little
cot
then
marc
resolved
to
go
out
and
resume
his
inquiry
directly
after
breakfast
while
he
was
dressing
he
thought
the
matter
over
quietly
and
sensibly
he
was
well
acquainted
with
maillebois
and
the
characteristics
of
its
two
thousand
inhabitants
divided
into
petty
petty
shopkeepers
and
workmen
the
latter
some
eight
hundred
in
number
being
distributed
through
the
workshops
of
some
four
or
five
firms
all
of
which
were
prosperous
thanks
to
the
vicinity
of
beaumont
being
nearly
equally
divided
the
two
sections
of
the
population
fought
strenuously
for
authority
and
the
municipal
council
was
a
faithful
picture
of
their
differences
one
half
of
it
being
clerical
and
reactionary
while
the
other
was
republican
and
progressive
as
yet
only
a
very
few
socialists
figured
in
the
population
lost
among
all
the
folk
of
other
views
and
they
were
quite
without
influence
darras
the
mayor
and
building
contractor
was
certainly
a
declared
republican
and
even
made
a
profession
of
but
owing
to
the
almost
equal
strength
of
the
two
parties
in
the
council
it
was
only
by
a
majority
of
two
votes
that
he
rich
and
active
with
about
a
hundred
workpeople
under
his
orders
had
been
preferred
to
philis
a
retired
tilt
and
awning
maker
with
an
income
of
from
ten
to
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
who
led
the
stern
confined
life
of
a
militant
clerical
interested
in
nothing
beyond
the
observance
of
the
narrowest
piety
thus
darras
was
compelled
to
observe
extreme
prudence
for
the
displacement
of
a
few
votes
would
unseat
him
ah
if
there
had
been
only
a
substantial
republican
majority
behind
him
how
bravely
he
would
have
supported
the
cause
of
liberty
truth
and
justice
instead
of
practising
as
he
was
reduced
to
do
the
most
diplomatic
another
thing
known
to
marc
was
the
increasing
power
of
the
clerical
party
which
seemed
likely
to
conquer
the
whole
region
for
ten
years
the
little
community
of
capuchins
established
in
the
old
convent
a
part
of
which
it
had
surrendered
to
the
brothers
of
the
christian
schools
had
carried
on
the
worship
of
antony
of
padua
with
audacity
and
also
with
such
great
success
that
the
profits
were
enormous
while
the
brothers
on
their
side
derived
advantage
from
this
success
which
brought
them
many
pupils
and
thus
increased
the
prosperity
of
the
schools
the
capuchins
worked
their
chapel
as
one
may
work
a
distillery
and
sent
forth
from
it
every
kind
of
moral
poison
the
saint
stood
on
a
golden
altar
ever
decked
with
flowers
and
ablaze
with
lights
collection
boxes
appeared
on
all
sides
and
a
commercial
office
was
permanently
installed
in
the
sacristy
where
the
procession
of
clients
lasted
from
morn
till
night
the
saint
did
not
merely
find
lost
things
his
specialty
in
the
early
days
of
his
he
had
extended
his
business
for
a
few
francs
he
undertook
to
enable
the
dullest
youths
to
pass
their
examinations
to
render
doubtful
business
affairs
excellent
to
exonerate
the
rich
scions
of
patriotic
families
from
military
service
to
say
nothing
of
performing
a
multitude
of
other
equally
genuine
miracles
such
as
healing
the
sick
and
the
maimed
and
according
a
positive
protection
against
ruin
and
death
in
the
last
respect
going
indeed
so
far
as
to
resuscitate
a
young
girl
who
had
expired
two
days
previously
naturally
enough
as
each
new
story
circulated
more
and
more
money
flowed
in
and
the
business
spread
from
the
and
shopkeepers
of
reactionary
maillebois
to
the
workmen
of
republican
maillebois
whom
the
poison
ended
by
infecting
footnote
the
protestant
reader
may
be
informed
that
this
saint
was
a
portuguese
franciscan
famous
for
the
eloquence
of
his
sermons
the
practices
of
which
zola
speaks
are
not
inventions
the
worship
of
antony
has
become
widespread
in
france
of
recent
years
such
is
superstition
it
is
true
that
in
his
sunday
sermons
abbé
quandieu
priest
of
martin
the
parish
church
forcibly
pointed
out
the
danger
of
low
superstition
but
few
people
listened
to
him
possessed
of
a
more
enlightened
faith
than
that
of
many
priests
he
deplored
the
harm
which
the
rapacity
of
the
capuchins
was
doing
to
religion
in
the
first
place
they
were
ruining
him
the
parish
church
was
losing
many
sources
of
revenue
all
the
alms
and
offerings
now
going
to
the
convent
chapel
but
his
grief
came
largely
from
a
higher
cause
he
experienced
the
sorrow
of
an
intelligent
priest
who
was
not
disposed
to
bow
to
rome
in
all
things
but
who
still
believed
in
the
possible
evolution
amid
the
great
modern
democratic
movement
of
an
independent
and
liberal
church
of
france
thus
he
waged
war
against
those
of
the
who
betrayed
the
cause
of
jesus
and
it
was
said
that
monseigneur
bergerot
the
bishop
of
beaumont
shared
his
views
but
this
did
not
prevent
the
capuchins
from
increasing
their
triumphs
subjugating
maillebois
and
transforming
it
into
a
holy
spot
by
dint
of
their
spurious
miracles
marc
also
knew
that
if
monseigneur
bergerot
was
behind
abbé
quandieu
the
capuchins
and
the
brothers
possessed
the
support
of
father
crabot
the
rector
of
the
college
of
valmarie
if
father
philibin
the
prefect
of
the
studies
there
had
presided
at
the
recent
at
the
brothers
school
it
had
been
by
way
of
according
to
the
latter
a
public
mark
of
esteem
and
protection
the
jesuits
had
the
affair
in
hand
as
folk
of
evil
mind
were
wont
to
say
and
simon
the
jew
schoolmaster
found
himself
caught
amid
those
inextricable
quarrels
alone
in
a
region
swept
by
religious
passion
at
a
dangerous
moment
when
the
victory
would
be
won
by
the
most
impudent
hearts
were
perturbed
a
spark
would
suffice
to
fire
and
devastate
all
minds
nevertheless
the
communal
school
had
not
lost
a
pupil
as
yet
its
attendances
and
successes
equalled
those
of
the
brothers
school
and
this
comparative
victory
was
undoubtedly
due
to
the
prudent
skill
displayed
by
simon
who
behaved
cautiously
with
everybody
and
who
moreover
was
supported
openly
by
darras
and
covertly
by
abbé
quandieu
but
the
rivalry
of
the
two
schools
would
undoubtedly
lead
to
the
real
battle
the
decisive
assault
which
must
come
sooner
or
later
for
these
two
schools
could
not
possibly
live
side
by
side
one
must
end
by
devouring
the
other
and
the
church
would
be
unable
to
subsist
should
she
lose
the
privilege
of
teaching
and
enslaving
the
humble
footnote
frequently
referred
to
in
zola
and
as
a
liberal
prelate
at
variance
with
the
that
morning
during
breakfast
with
the
ladies
in
the
dismal
little
marc
already
oppressed
by
his
reflections
felt
his
discomfort
increase
madame
duparque
quietly
related
that
if
polydor
had
secured
a
prize
the
previous
day
he
owed
it
to
a
pious
precaution
taken
by
his
aunt
pélagie
who
had
thoughtfully
given
a
franc
to
antony
of
padua
on
hearing
this
madame
berthereau
nodded
as
if
approvingly
and
even
geneviève
did
not
venture
to
smile
but
seemed
interested
in
the
marvellous
stories
related
by
her
grandmother
the
old
lady
recounted
a
number
of
extraordinary
incidents
how
lives
and
fortunes
had
been
saved
thanks
to
presents
of
two
and
three
francs
bestowed
on
the
saint
by
the
medium
of
the
capuchins
agency
and
one
realised
how
one
little
sum
being
added
to
another
rivers
of
gold
ended
by
flowing
to
their
chapel
like
so
much
tribute
levied
on
public
suffering
and
imbecility
however
that
morning
number
of
petit
printed
during
the
night
had
arrived
and
marc
was
well
pleased
when
at
the
end
of
a
long
article
on
the
crime
of
maillebois
he
found
a
paragraph
containing
a
very
favourable
mention
of
simon
the
schoolmaster
who
was
esteemed
by
everybody
had
received
it
was
said
the
most
touching
assurances
of
sympathy
in
the
great
misfortune
which
had
befallen
him
this
note
had
evidently
been
penned
by
some
correspondent
the
previous
evening
after
the
tumultuous
departure
from
the
distribution
of
prizes
which
had
indicated
in
which
direction
the
wind
was
likely
to
blow
indeed
nobody
could
have
mistaken
the
public
hostility
against
the
brothers
and
all
the
vague
rumours
all
the
horrid
stories
hushed
up
in
the
past
aggravated
that
hostility
in
such
wise
that
one
was
threatened
with
some
abominable
scandal
in
which
the
whole
catholic
and
reactionary
party
might
collapse
thus
marc
was
surprised
at
the
lively
and
even
triumphant
demeanour
of
pélagie
when
she
came
in
to
clear
the
breakfast
table
he
lingered
there
on
purpose
to
draw
her
out
there
good
news
monsieur
said
she
learnt
something
and
no
mistake
when
i
went
on
my
errands
this
morning
i
knew
very
well
that
those
anarchists
who
insulted
the
brothers
yesterday
were
liars
then
she
recounted
all
the
of
the
shops
all
the
gossip
she
had
picked
up
on
the
whilst
going
from
door
to
door
amid
the
oppressive
horror
the
disturbing
mystery
that
had
weighed
upon
the
town
for
four
and
twenty
hours
the
wildest
fancies
had
been
gradually
germinating
it
seemed
as
if
some
poisonous
vegetation
had
sprung
up
during
the
night
at
first
there
were
only
the
vaguest
suppositions
then
explanations
suggested
chancewise
became
certainties
and
doubtful
coincidences
were
transformed
into
irrefutable
proofs
and
a
point
to
be
remarked
was
that
all
these
stealthy
developments
originating
nobody
knew
how
or
where
but
spreading
hour
by
hour
and
diffusing
doubt
and
uneasiness
turned
in
favour
of
the
brothers
and
against
simon
is
quite
certain
you
know
monsieur
said
pélagie
the
schoolmaster
cared
very
little
for
his
nephew
he
him
he
was
seen
doing
so
by
people
who
will
say
it
besides
he
was
vexed
at
not
having
him
in
his
school
he
was
in
no
end
of
a
passion
when
the
lad
took
his
first
communion
he
shook
his
fist
at
him
and
blasphemed
and
at
all
events
it
is
very
extraordinary
that
the
little
angel
should
have
been
killed
only
a
little
while
after
he
had
left
the
holy
table
and
when
god
was
still
within
him
a
pang
came
to
marc
heart
he
listened
to
the
servant
with
stupefaction
do
you
mean
he
at
last
exclaimed
people
accusing
simon
of
having
killed
his
nephew
some
do
scruple
to
think
it
that
story
of
going
to
enjoy
himself
at
beaumont
then
missing
the
train
at
ten
and
coming
back
on
foot
seems
a
strange
one
he
reached
home
at
twenty
minutes
to
twelve
he
says
but
nobody
saw
him
and
he
may
very
well
have
returned
by
train
an
hour
earlier
at
the
very
moment
when
the
crime
was
committed
and
when
it
was
over
he
only
had
to
blow
out
the
candle
and
leave
the
window
wide
open
in
order
to
make
people
suppose
that
the
murderer
had
come
from
outside
at
about
a
quarter
to
eleven
mademoiselle
rouzaire
the
schoolmistress
distinctly
heard
a
sound
of
footsteps
in
the
school
moans
and
calls
too
and
the
opening
and
shutting
of
doors
rouzaire
cried
marc
she
did
not
say
a
word
of
that
in
her
first
evidence
i
was
present
me
monsieur
but
at
the
butcher
just
now
mademoiselle
rouzaire
was
telling
it
to
everybody
and
i
heard
her
the
young
man
quite
aghast
allowed
the
servant
to
continue
mignot
the
also
says
that
he
was
greatly
surprised
at
the
sound
sleep
in
the
morning
and
indeed
it
is
extraordinary
that
one
should
have
to
go
and
awaken
a
man
on
the
day
when
a
murder
is
committed
in
his
house
it
seems
too
that
he
was
the
least
bit
touched
he
merely
trembled
like
a
leaf
when
he
saw
the
little
body
marc
again
wished
to
protest
but
pélagie
in
a
stubborn
malicious
way
went
on
it
was
surely
he
for
a
which
came
from
his
class
was
found
in
the
child
mouth
only
the
master
could
have
had
that
slip
in
his
pocket
is
that
not
so
it
is
said
that
it
was
even
signed
by
him
at
the
greengrocer
too
i
heard
a
lady
say
that
the
police
officials
had
found
a
number
of
similar
slips
in
his
cupboard
this
time
marc
retorted
by
stating
the
facts
speaking
of
the
illegible
initials
on
the
slip
which
simon
declared
had
never
been
in
his
hands
though
as
it
was
of
a
pattern
in
common
use
one
might
have
found
it
in
any
school
however
when
pélagie
declared
that
overwhelming
proofs
had
been
discovered
that
very
morning
during
the
search
made
by
the
officials
in
simon
rooms
the
young
man
began
to
feel
exceedingly
disturbed
and
ceased
to
protest
for
he
realised
that
in
the
frightful
confusion
which
was
spreading
through
people
minds
all
arguments
would
be
futile
see
monsieur
pélagie
continued
can
expect
anything
when
one
has
to
deal
with
a
jew
as
the
milkman
said
to
me
just
now
those
folk
have
no
real
family
ties
no
real
country
they
carry
on
dealings
with
the
devil
they
pillage
people
and
kill
just
for
the
pleasure
of
doing
evil
and
you
may
say
what
you
like
you
wo
prevent
people
from
believing
that
that
jew
needed
a
child
life
for
some
dirty
business
with
the
devil
and
cunningly
waited
till
his
nephew
had
taken
his
first
communion
in
order
that
he
might
pollute
and
murder
him
while
he
was
stainless
and
full
of
perfume
from
the
presence
of
the
host
it
was
the
charge
of
ritual
murder
reappearing
that
haunting
charge
transmitted
through
the
ages
and
reviving
at
each
catastrophe
relentlessly
pursuing
those
hateful
jews
who
poisoned
wells
and
butchered
little
children
on
two
occasions
geneviève
who
suffered
when
she
saw
how
marc
was
quivering
had
felt
desirous
of
interrupting
and
joining
in
his
protests
but
she
had
restrained
herself
from
fear
of
irritating
her
grandmother
who
was
evidently
well
pleased
with
the
servant
gossip
for
she
nodded
approval
of
it
in
fact
madame
duparque
regarded
it
as
a
victory
and
disdaining
to
lecture
her
whom
she
deemed
already
vanquished
she
contented
herself
with
saying
to
the
madame
berthereau
is
just
like
that
dead
child
who
was
found
many
years
ago
in
the
porch
of
maxence
a
woman
in
the
service
of
some
jews
narrowly
escaped
being
sentenced
in
their
place
for
only
a
jew
could
have
been
the
murderer
when
one
frequents
such
folk
one
is
always
exposed
to
the
wrath
of
god
marc
preferred
to
make
no
rejoinder
and
almost
immediately
afterwards
he
went
out
but
his
perturbation
was
extreme
and
a
doubt
came
to
him
could
simon
really
be
guilty
the
suspicion
attacked
him
like
some
evil
fever
contracted
in
a
pernicious
spot
and
he
felt
a
need
of
reflecting
and
recovering
his
equilibrium
before
he
called
upon
his
colleague
so
he
went
off
along
the
deserted
road
to
valmarie
picturing
as
he
walked
all
the
incidents
of
the
previous
day
and
weighing
men
and
things
no
no
simon
could
not
be
reasonably
suspected
certainties
presented
themselves
on
all
sides
first
of
all
such
a
horrible
crime
on
his
part
was
utterly
illogical
impossible
he
was
assuredly
healthy
in
body
and
mind
he
had
no
physiological
flaws
his
gentle
gaiety
denoted
the
regularity
of
his
life
and
he
had
a
wife
of
resplendent
beauty
whom
he
adored
beside
whom
he
lived
in
loving
ecstasy
grateful
to
her
for
the
handsome
children
who
had
sprung
from
their
affection
and
had
become
their
living
love
and
worship
how
was
it
possible
to
imagine
that
such
a
man
had
yielded
to
a
fit
of
abominable
madness
a
few
moments
before
rejoining
his
spouse
and
his
little
children
slumbering
in
their
cots
again
how
simple
and
truthful
on
the
previous
day
had
been
the
accents
of
that
man
who
was
exposed
to
the
scrutiny
of
so
many
enemies
who
loved
his
calling
to
the
point
of
heroism
who
made
the
best
of
his
poverty
without
ever
uttering
a
word
of
complaint
the
account
he
had
given
of
his
evening
had
been
very
clear
his
wife
had
confirmed
his
statements
respecting
the
time
of
his
return
none
of
the
information
that
he
had
furnished
seemed
open
to
doubt
and
if
some
obscure
points
remained
if
that
crumpled
found
with
a
number
of
petit
constituted
an
enigma
as
yet
unravelled
reason
at
least
indicated
that
the
culprit
must
be
sought
elsewhere
for
simon
nature
and
life
the
very
conditions
in
which
he
lived
showed
that
he
could
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
crime
on
that
point
marc
experienced
a
feeling
of
certainty
based
on
reason
on
truth
itself
which
remains
unshakable
when
once
it
is
established
by
observation
and
the
deductions
that
facts
supply
thus
the
young
man
conviction
was
formed
there
were
certain
ascertained
facts
to
which
he
would
bring
everything
else
back
and
although
every
error
and
falsehood
might
be
launched
he
would
brush
all
assertions
aside
if
they
did
not
agree
with
such
truths
as
were
already
known
and
demonstrated
serene
once
more
relieved
of
the
burden
of
his
doubts
marc
returned
to
maillebois
passing
the
railway
station
at
the
moment
when
some
passengers
were
alighting
from
a
train
which
had
just
arrived
among
those
who
emerged
from
the
station
he
perceived
the
elementary
education
inspector
of
the
handsome
mauraisin
as
he
was
called
a
very
dark
foppish
little
man
of
whose
thin
lips
and
whose
chin
were
hidden
by
a
carefully
kept
moustache
and
beard
while
glasses
screened
his
eager
eyes
formerly
a
professor
at
the
beaumont
training
college
mauraisin
belonged
to
that
new
generation
the
who
are
ever
on
the
lookout
for
advancement
and
who
always
place
themselves
on
the
stronger
side
he
it
was
said
had
coveted
the
directorship
of
the
training
college
which
had
fallen
to
salvan
whom
he
pursued
with
covert
hatred
but
very
prudently
for
he
was
aware
of
salvan
great
credit
with
le
barazer
the
academy
inspector
on
whom
he
himself
depended
besides
in
presence
of
the
equality
of
the
forces
which
were
contending
for
supremacy
in
his
mauraisin
in
spite
of
his
personal
preferences
for
the
clericals
the
priests
and
monks
whom
he
regarded
as
clever
had
been
skilful
enough
to
refrain
from
declaring
himself
too
openly
thus
when
marc
perceived
the
elementary
inspector
it
was
allowable
for
him
to
fancy
that
le
barazer
with
whose
good
nature
he
was
acquainted
had
despatched
his
subordinate
to
the
assistance
of
simon
in
the
terrible
catastrophe
which
threatened
to
sweep
the
schoolmaster
of
maillebois
and
his
school
away
footnote
in
matters
of
education
the
french
territory
is
apportioned
among
a
number
of
such
as
those
of
paris
caen
rennes
bordeaux
dijon
which
are
each
governed
by
rectors
and
which
combined
constitute
the
university
of
france
of
which
the
minister
of
public
instruction
for
the
time
being
is
the
the
rectors
communicate
with
him
under
them
in
each
territorial
department
within
their
jurisdiction
they
have
an
who
is
provided
with
a
general
secretary
and
who
in
turn
has
under
him
several
subordinate
inspectors
called
de
primaire
there
is
one
of
these
for
each
into
which
the
departments
are
the
young
man
therefore
hastened
his
steps
desirous
of
paying
his
respects
to
the
inspector
but
all
at
once
an
unexpected
incident
restrained
him
a
cassock
had
emerged
from
a
neighbouring
street
and
he
recognised
in
its
wearer
father
crabot
the
rector
of
the
jesuit
college
of
valmarie
a
tall
man
without
a
white
hair
at
five
and
forty
father
crabot
had
a
broad
and
regular
face
with
a
somewhat
large
nose
amiable
eyes
and
thick
caressing
lips
the
only
failing
with
which
he
was
reproached
was
a
tendency
to
become
a
fashionable
cleric
as
a
result
of
the
many
aristocratic
connections
which
he
was
always
eager
to
form
but
those
connections
simply
increased
the
sphere
of
his
power
and
some
people
said
with
good
reason
that
he
was
the
secret
master
of
the
department
and
that
the
victory
of
the
church
which
was
assuredly
approaching
depended
solely
on
him
marc
felt
surprised
and
disquieted
on
seeing
the
jesuit
at
maillebois
at
that
hour
had
he
quitted
valmarie
very
early
in
the
morning
then
what
urgent
business
what
pressing
visits
had
brought
him
there
whence
had
he
come
whither
was
he
going
distributing
bows
and
smiles
as
he
passed
through
the
streets
full
of
the
fever
born
by
rumour
and
and
all
at
once
marc
saw
father
crabot
stop
at
the
sight
of
mauraisin
and
offer
the
latter
his
hand
with
charming
cordiality
their
conversation
was
not
a
long
one
it
consisted
no
doubt
of
the
usual
commonplaces
but
they
seemed
to
be
on
excellent
terms
as
if
indeed
they
discreetly
understood
each
other
when
the
elementary
inspector
quitted
the
jesuit
he
drew
his
little
figure
erect
evidently
feeling
very
proud
of
that
handshake
which
had
inspired
him
with
an
opinion
a
resolution
which
perhaps
he
had
hitherto
hesitated
to
form
but
father
crabot
going
his
way
also
caught
sight
of
marc
and
recognising
him
from
having
seen
him
at
madame
duparque
where
he
occasionally
condescended
to
call
made
a
great
show
of
doffing
his
hat
by
way
of
salutation
the
young
man
who
stood
on
the
kerb
of
the
footway
was
compelled
to
respond
by
a
similar
act
of
politeness
and
then
watched
the
jesuit
as
the
latter
filling
the
streets
with
the
sweep
of
his
cassock
betook
himself
through
maillebois
which
felt
very
honoured
flattered
and
subjugated
by
his
presence
marc
for
his
part
slowly
resumed
his
walk
towards
the
school
the
current
of
his
thoughts
had
changed
he
was
growing
gloomy
again
as
if
he
were
returning
to
some
contaminated
spot
where
slow
poison
had
diffused
hostility
the
houses
did
not
seem
to
be
the
same
as
on
the
previous
day
and
in
particular
the
faces
of
the
people
appeared
to
have
changed
thus
when
he
reached
simon
rooms
he
was
quite
surprised
to
find
his
friend
quietly
sorting
some
papers
in
the
midst
of
his
family
rachel
was
seated
near
the
window
the
two
children
were
playing
in
a
corner
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
sadness
of
the
parents
one
would
have
thought
that
nothing
unusual
had
occurred
in
the
house
simon
however
stepped
forward
and
pressed
marc
hands
with
keen
emotion
like
one
who
felt
how
friendly
and
bravely
sympathetic
was
the
visit
the
perquisition
early
that
morning
was
at
once
spoken
of
the
police
been
here
marc
inquired
it
was
quite
natural
they
should
come
i
expected
it
of
course
they
found
nothing
and
went
off
with
empty
hands
marc
restrained
a
gesture
of
astonishment
what
had
pélagie
told
him
why
had
people
spread
rumours
of
crushing
proofs
of
the
discovery
among
other
things
of
identical
with
the
one
found
in
the
room
of
the
crime
were
lies
being
told
then
you
see
simon
continued
am
setting
my
papers
in
order
for
they
mixed
them
up
what
a
frightful
affair
my
friend
we
no
longer
know
if
we
exist
then
he
mentioned
that
the
examination
of
remains
was
to
take
place
that
very
day
indeed
they
were
then
expecting
the
medical
officer
of
the
public
prosecution
service
but
doubtless
it
would
only
be
possible
to
bury
the
body
on
the
morrow
my
part
simon
added
you
will
well
understand
i
seem
to
be
living
in
a
nightmare
i
ask
myself
if
such
a
catastrophe
is
possible
i
have
been
thinking
of
nothing
else
since
yesterday
morning
i
am
always
beginning
the
same
story
afresh
my
return
on
foot
so
late
but
in
great
quietude
my
arrival
at
the
house
which
was
fast
asleep
and
then
that
frightful
awakening
in
the
morning
these
remarks
gave
marc
an
opportunity
to
ask
a
few
questions
you
meet
nobody
on
the
road
he
inquired
nobody
see
you
arrive
here
at
the
hour
you
named
no
i
met
nobody
and
i
think
nobody
saw
me
come
in
at
that
late
hour
nobody
is
about
in
maillebois
silence
fell
then
marc
resumed
as
you
did
not
take
the
train
back
you
did
not
use
your
return
ticket
have
you
still
got
it
return
ticket
no
i
was
so
furious
when
i
saw
the
ten
train
going
off
without
me
that
i
threw
the
ticket
away
in
the
station
yard
directly
i
decided
to
return
on
foot
silence
fell
again
and
simon
gazed
fixedly
at
his
friend
saying
do
you
put
these
questions
to
me
marc
affectionately
grasped
his
hands
once
more
and
retained
them
for
a
moment
in
his
own
whilst
resolving
to
warn
him
of
impending
danger
indeed
to
tell
him
everything
regret
he
said
nobody
saw
you
and
i
regret
still
more
that
you
did
not
keep
your
return
ticket
there
are
so
many
fools
and
malicious
folks
about
it
is
being
reported
that
this
morning
the
police
found
overwhelming
proofs
here
copies
of
the
initialled
in
the
same
way
as
the
one
which
formed
part
of
the
gag
mignot
it
seems
is
astonished
that
he
should
have
found
you
so
sound
asleep
yesterday
morning
and
mademoiselle
rouzaire
now
remembers
that
about
a
quarter
to
eleven
on
the
night
of
the
crime
she
heard
voices
and
footsteps
as
if
somebody
were
entering
the
house
very
pale
but
very
calm
simon
smiled
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
that
it
is
it
they
are
suspecting
me
well
i
now
understand
the
expressions
i
have
seen
on
the
faces
of
the
folk
who
have
been
passing
the
school
since
early
this
morning
mignot
who
is
a
good
fellow
at
heart
will
of
course
say
as
everybody
else
says
for
fear
of
compromising
himself
with
a
jew
like
me
as
for
mademoiselle
rouzaire
she
will
sacrifice
me
ten
times
over
if
her
confessor
has
suggested
it
to
her
and
if
she
finds
a
chance
of
advancement
or
merely
additional
consideration
in
such
a
fine
deed
ah
they
are
suspecting
me
are
they
and
the
whole
pack
of
clerical
hounds
has
been
let
loose
he
almost
laughed
as
he
spoke
but
rachel
whose
customary
indolence
seemed
to
have
been
increased
by
her
deep
grief
had
now
suddenly
risen
her
beautiful
countenance
all
aglow
with
dolorous
revolt
you
they
suspect
you
of
such
ignominy
she
exclaimed
who
were
so
kind
and
gentle
when
you
came
home
and
clasped
me
in
your
arms
and
spoke
such
loving
words
to
me
they
must
be
mad
is
it
not
sufficient
that
i
should
speak
the
truth
tell
of
your
return
and
of
the
night
we
spent
together
then
she
flung
herself
upon
his
neck
weeping
and
relapsing
into
the
weakness
of
an
adored
and
caressed
woman
pressing
her
to
his
heart
her
husband
strove
to
reassure
and
calm
her
be
distressed
my
darling
those
stories
are
idiotic
they
stand
on
nothing
i
am
quite
at
ease
the
authorities
may
turn
everything
here
upside
down
they
may
search
all
my
past
life
they
will
find
no
guilt
in
it
i
have
only
to
speak
the
truth
and
do
you
know
nothing
can
stand
against
the
truth
it
is
the
great
the
eternal
victor
then
turning
to
his
friend
he
added
it
not
so
my
good
marc
is
one
not
invincible
when
one
has
truth
on
one
side
if
marc
had
not
been
convinced
already
of
simon
innocence
his
last
doubts
would
have
fled
amid
the
emotion
of
that
scene
yielding
to
an
impulse
of
his
heart
he
embraced
both
husband
and
wife
as
if
giving
himself
to
them
entirely
in
order
to
help
them
in
the
grave
crisis
which
he
foresaw
desirous
as
he
was
of
taking
immediate
action
he
again
spoke
of
the
for
he
felt
that
it
was
the
one
important
piece
of
evidence
on
which
the
elucidation
of
the
whole
affair
must
be
reared
but
how
puzzling
was
that
crumpled
bitten
slip
of
paper
soiled
by
saliva
with
its
initialling
or
its
blot
half
effaced
and
with
one
of
its
corners
carried
away
no
doubt
by
the
victim
teeth
the
very
words
one
another
lithographed
in
a
fine
english
seemed
fraught
with
a
terrible
irony
whence
had
that
slip
come
who
had
brought
it
to
that
room
the
boy
or
his
murderer
and
how
could
one
ascertain
the
truth
when
the
mesdames
milhomme
the
neighbouring
stationers
sold
such
slips
almost
daily
simon
for
his
part
could
only
repeat
that
he
had
never
had
that
particular
one
in
his
school
my
boys
would
say
so
that
copy
never
entered
the
school
never
passed
under
their
eyes
marc
regarded
this
as
valuable
information
they
could
testify
to
that
effect
he
exclaimed
it
is
being
falsely
rumoured
that
the
police
found
similar
copies
in
your
rooms
one
must
the
truth
immediately
call
on
your
pupils
at
their
homes
and
demand
their
evidence
before
anybody
tries
to
tamper
with
their
memory
give
me
the
names
of
a
few
of
them
i
will
take
the
matter
in
hand
and
carry
it
through
this
afternoon
simon
strong
in
the
consciousness
of
his
innocence
at
first
refused
to
do
so
but
eventually
among
his
pupils
parents
he
named
bongard
a
farmer
on
the
road
to
la
désirade
masson
doloir
a
workman
living
in
the
rue
plaisir
and
savin
a
clerk
in
the
rue
fauche
those
three
would
suffice
unless
marc
should
also
like
to
call
on
the
mesdames
milhomme
thus
everything
was
settled
and
marc
went
off
to
lunch
promising
that
he
would
return
in
the
evening
to
acquaint
simon
with
the
result
of
his
inquiries
once
outside
on
the
square
however
he
again
caught
sight
of
handsome
mauraisin
this
time
the
elementary
inspector
was
deep
in
conference
with
mademoiselle
rouzaire
he
was
usually
most
punctilious
and
prudent
with
the
schoolmistresses
in
consequence
of
his
narrow
escape
from
trouble
a
few
years
previously
in
connection
with
a
young
who
had
shrieked
like
a
little
booby
when
he
had
simply
wished
to
kiss
her
malicious
people
said
that
mademoiselle
rouzaire
did
not
shriek
although
she
was
so
ugly
and
that
this
explained
both
the
favourable
reports
she
secured
and
her
prospects
of
rapid
advancement
standing
at
the
gate
of
her
little
garden
she
was
now
speaking
to
mauraisin
with
great
volubility
making
sweeping
gestures
in
the
direction
of
the
boys
school
while
the
inspector
wagging
his
head
listened
to
her
attentively
at
last
they
entered
the
garden
together
gently
closing
the
gate
behind
them
it
was
evident
to
marc
that
the
woman
was
telling
mauraisin
about
the
crime
and
the
sounds
of
footsteps
and
voices
which
she
now
declared
she
had
heard
at
the
thought
of
this
the
quiver
of
the
early
morning
returned
to
marc
he
again
experienced
discomfort
a
discomfort
arising
from
his
hostile
surroundings
from
the
dark
stealthy
plot
which
was
brewing
gathering
like
a
storm
rendering
the
atmosphere
more
and
more
oppressive
singular
indeed
was
the
fashion
in
which
that
elementary
inspector
went
to
the
help
of
a
threatened
master
he
began
by
taking
the
opinions
of
all
the
surrounding
folk
whom
jealousy
or
hatred
inspired
at
two
in
the
afternoon
marc
found
himself
on
the
road
to
la
désirade
just
outside
maillebois
bongard
whose
name
had
been
given
him
by
simon
there
owned
a
little
farm
of
a
few
fields
which
he
cultivated
himself
with
difficulty
securing
as
he
put
it
no
more
than
was
needed
to
provide
daily
bread
marc
luckily
met
him
just
as
he
had
returned
home
with
a
cartload
of
hay
he
was
a
strong
and
stoutish
man
with
round
eyes
and
placid
silent
face
beardless
but
seldom
fresh
shaven
on
her
side
la
bongard
a
long
bony
who
was
also
present
preparing
some
mash
for
her
cow
showed
an
extremely
plain
countenance
outrageously
freckled
with
a
patch
of
colour
on
each
and
an
expression
of
close
reserve
both
looked
suspiciously
at
the
strange
gentleman
whom
they
saw
entering
their
yard
am
the
jonville
schoolmaster
said
marc
have
a
little
boy
who
attends
the
communal
school
at
maillebois
have
you
not
at
that
moment
fernand
the
boy
in
question
who
had
been
playing
on
the
road
ran
up
he
was
a
sturdy
lad
of
nine
years
fashioned
one
might
have
thought
with
a
billhook
and
showing
a
low
brow
and
a
dull
heavy
countenance
he
was
followed
by
his
sister
angèle
a
lass
of
seven
with
a
similarly
massive
but
more
knowing
face
for
in
her
quick
eyes
one
espied
some
dawning
intelligence
which
was
striving
to
escape
from
its
fleshy
prison
she
had
heard
marc
question
and
she
cried
in
a
shrill
voice
go
to
mademoiselle
rouzaire
i
do
fernand
goes
to
monsieur
simon
bongard
had
sent
his
children
to
the
communal
schools
first
because
the
teaching
cost
him
nothing
and
secondly
because
as
a
matter
of
mere
instinct
for
he
had
never
reasoned
the
question
he
was
not
on
the
side
of
the
priests
he
practised
no
religion
and
if
la
bongard
went
to
church
it
was
simply
from
habit
and
by
way
of
diversion
all
that
the
husband
who
was
scarce
able
to
read
or
write
appreciated
in
his
wife
who
was
still
more
ignorant
than
himself
was
her
powers
of
endurance
which
similar
to
those
of
a
beast
of
burden
enabled
her
to
toil
from
morn
till
night
without
complaining
and
the
farmer
showed
little
or
no
anxiety
whether
his
children
made
progress
at
school
as
a
matter
of
fact
little
fernand
was
industrious
and
took
no
end
of
pains
but
could
get
nothing
into
his
head
whereas
little
angèle
who
proved
yet
more
painstaking
and
stubborn
at
last
seemed
likely
to
become
a
passable
pupil
she
was
like
so
much
human
matter
in
the
rough
lately
fashioned
of
clay
and
awaking
to
intelligence
by
a
slow
and
dolorous
effort
am
monsieur
simon
friend
marc
resumed
i
have
come
on
his
behalf
about
what
has
happened
you
have
heard
of
the
crime
have
you
not
most
certainly
they
had
heard
of
it
their
anxious
faces
suddenly
became
impenetrable
in
such
wise
that
one
could
read
on
them
neither
feeling
nor
thought
why
had
that
stranger
come
to
question
them
in
this
fashion
their
ideas
about
things
concerned
nobody
besides
it
was
necessary
to
be
prudent
in
matters
in
which
a
word
too
much
often
suffices
to
bring
about
a
man
sentence
so
marc
continued
should
like
to
know
if
your
little
boy
ever
saw
in
his
class
a
like
this
marc
himself
on
a
slip
of
paper
had
written
the
words
vous
les
uns
les
in
a
fine
of
the
proper
size
having
explained
matters
he
showed
the
paper
to
fernand
who
looked
at
it
in
a
dazed
fashion
for
his
mind
worked
slowly
and
he
did
not
yet
understand
what
was
asked
him
well
at
it
my
little
friend
said
marc
you
ever
see
such
a
copy
at
the
school
but
before
the
lad
had
made
up
his
mind
bongard
in
his
circumspect
manner
intervened
child
does
know
how
can
he
know
and
la
bongard
like
her
husband
shadow
added
of
course
a
child
it
can
never
know
without
listening
to
them
however
marc
insisted
and
placed
the
copy
in
the
hands
of
fernand
who
fearing
that
he
might
be
punished
made
an
effort
and
at
last
responded
monsieur
i
never
saw
it
as
he
spoke
he
raised
his
head
and
his
eyes
met
his
father
which
were
fixed
on
him
so
sternly
that
he
hastened
to
add
stammering
as
he
did
so
all
the
same
i
did
see
it
i
do
know
that
was
all
that
could
be
got
out
of
him
when
marc
pressed
him
his
answers
became
incoherent
while
his
parents
themselves
said
yes
or
no
chancewise
according
to
what
they
deemed
to
be
their
interest
it
was
bongard
prudent
habit
to
jog
his
head
in
approval
of
every
opinion
expressed
by
those
who
spoke
to
him
for
fear
of
compromising
himself
yes
yes
it
was
a
frightful
crime
and
if
the
culprit
should
be
caught
it
would
be
quite
right
to
cut
off
his
head
each
man
to
his
trade
the
gendarmes
knew
theirs
there
were
rascals
everywhere
as
for
the
priests
there
was
some
good
in
them
but
all
the
same
one
had
a
right
to
follow
one
own
ideas
and
at
last
as
marc
could
learn
nothing
positive
he
had
to
take
himself
off
watched
inquisitively
by
the
children
and
pursued
by
the
shrill
voice
of
little
angèle
who
began
chattering
with
her
brother
as
soon
as
the
gentleman
could
no
longer
detect
what
she
said
the
young
man
gave
way
to
some
sad
reflections
as
he
returned
to
maillebois
he
had
just
come
in
contact
with
the
thick
layer
of
human
ignorance
the
huge
blind
deaf
multitude
still
enwrapped
in
the
slumber
of
the
earth
behind
the
bongards
the
whole
mass
of
country
folk
remained
stubbornly
dimly
vegetating
ever
slow
to
awaken
to
a
true
perception
of
things
there
was
a
whole
nation
to
be
educated
if
one
desired
that
it
should
be
born
to
truth
and
justice
but
how
colossal
would
be
the
labour
how
could
it
be
raised
from
the
clay
in
which
it
lingered
how
many
generations
perhaps
would
be
needed
to
free
the
race
from
darkness
even
at
the
present
time
the
vast
majority
of
the
social
body
remained
in
infancy
in
primitive
imbecility
in
the
case
of
bongard
one
descended
to
mere
brute
matter
which
was
incapable
of
being
just
because
it
knew
nothing
and
would
learn
nothing
marc
turned
to
the
left
and
after
crossing
the
high
street
found
himself
in
the
poor
quarter
of
maillebois
various
industrial
establishments
there
polluted
the
waters
of
the
verpille
and
the
sordid
houses
of
the
narrow
streets
were
the
homes
of
many
workpeople
doloir
the
mason
tenanted
four
fairly
large
rooms
on
a
first
floor
over
a
wineshop
in
the
rue
plaisir
marc
imperfectly
informed
respecting
the
address
was
seeking
it
when
he
came
upon
a
party
of
masons
who
had
just
quitted
their
work
to
drink
a
glass
together
at
the
bar
of
the
wineshop
they
were
discussing
the
crime
in
violent
language
jew
capable
of
anything
one
big
fair
fellow
exclaimed
was
one
in
my
regiment
who
was
a
thief
but
that
did
not
prevent
him
from
being
a
corporal
for
a
jew
always
gets
out
of
difficulties
another
mason
short
and
dark
shrugged
his
shoulders
quite
agree
said
he
the
jews
are
not
worth
much
but
all
the
same
the
priests
are
no
better
as
for
the
priests
the
other
retorted
are
good
some
are
bad
at
all
events
the
priests
are
frenchmen
whereas
those
dirty
beasts
the
jews
have
sold
france
to
the
foreigners
twice
already
then
as
his
comrade
somewhat
shaken
in
his
views
asked
him
if
he
had
read
that
in
petit
i
did
he
added
newspapers
give
me
too
much
of
a
headache
but
some
of
my
mates
told
me
and
besides
everybody
knows
it
well
the
others
thereupon
feeling
convinced
became
silent
and
slowly
drained
their
glasses
they
were
just
quitting
the
wineshop
when
marc
approaching
asked
the
tall
fair
one
if
he
knew
where
doloir
the
mason
lived
the
workman
laughed
monsieur
that
me
he
said
live
here
those
are
my
three
windows
the
adventure
quite
enlivened
this
tall
sturdy
fellow
of
somewhat
military
bearing
as
he
laughed
his
big
moustaches
rose
disclosing
his
teeth
which
looked
very
white
in
his
highly
coloured
face
with
large
blue
eyes
could
not
have
asked
anybody
more
likely
to
know
could
you
monsieur
he
continued
do
you
wish
of
me
marc
looked
at
him
with
a
feeling
of
some
sympathy
in
spite
of
the
hateful
words
he
had
heard
doloir
who
had
been
for
several
years
in
the
employment
of
darras
the
mayor
and
building
contractor
was
a
fairly
good
workman
one
who
occasionally
drank
a
drop
too
much
but
who
took
his
pay
home
to
his
wife
regularly
he
certainly
growled
about
the
employers
referred
to
them
as
a
dirty
gang
and
called
himself
a
socialist
though
he
had
only
a
vague
idea
what
socialism
might
be
at
the
same
time
he
had
some
esteem
for
darras
who
while
making
a
great
deal
of
money
tried
to
remain
a
comrade
with
his
men
but
above
everything
else
three
years
of
had
left
an
ineffaceable
mark
on
doloir
he
had
quitted
the
army
in
a
transport
of
delight
at
his
deliverance
freely
cursing
the
disgusting
and
hateful
calling
in
which
one
ceased
to
be
a
man
but
ever
since
that
time
he
had
been
continually
living
his
three
years
service
afresh
not
a
day
passed
but
some
recollection
of
it
came
to
him
with
his
hand
spoilt
as
it
were
by
the
rifle
he
had
carried
he
had
found
his
trowel
heavy
and
had
returned
to
work
in
a
spiritless
fashion
like
one
who
was
no
longer
accustomed
to
toil
but
whose
will
was
broken
and
whose
body
had
become
used
to
long
spells
of
idleness
such
as
those
which
intervened
between
the
hours
of
military
exercise
to
become
once
more
the
excellent
workman
that
he
had
been
previously
was
impossible
besides
he
was
haunted
by
military
matters
to
which
he
was
always
referring
apropos
of
any
subject
that
presented
itself
but
he
chattered
in
a
confused
way
he
had
no
information
he
read
nothing
he
knew
nothing
being
simply
firm
and
stubborn
on
the
patriotic
question
which
to
his
mind
consisted
in
preventing
the
jews
from
handing
france
over
to
the
foreigners
have
two
children
at
the
communal
school
marc
said
to
him
i
have
come
from
the
master
my
friend
simon
for
some
information
but
i
see
that
you
are
hardly
a
friend
of
the
jews
doloir
still
laughed
true
said
he
monsieur
simon
is
a
jew
but
hitherto
i
always
thought
him
a
worthy
man
what
information
do
you
want
monsieur
when
he
learnt
that
the
question
was
merely
one
of
showing
his
children
a
writing
copy
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
they
had
ever
used
it
in
their
class
he
responded
can
be
easier
monsieur
if
it
will
do
you
a
service
come
upstairs
with
me
the
children
must
be
at
home
the
door
was
opened
by
madame
doloir
a
dark
short
but
robust
woman
having
a
serious
energetic
face
with
a
low
brow
frank
eyes
and
a
chin
although
she
was
barely
nine
and
twenty
she
was
already
the
mother
of
three
children
and
it
was
evident
that
she
was
expecting
a
fourth
but
this
did
not
prevent
her
from
being
always
the
first
to
rise
and
the
last
to
go
to
bed
in
the
home
for
she
was
very
industrious
very
thrifty
always
busy
scrubbing
and
cleaning
she
had
quitted
her
employment
as
a
seamstress
about
the
time
of
the
birth
of
her
third
child
and
nowadays
she
only
attended
to
her
home
but
she
did
so
like
a
woman
who
fully
earned
her
bread
gentleman
is
a
friend
of
the
schoolmaster
and
wishes
to
speak
to
the
children
her
husband
explained
to
her
marc
entered
a
very
clean
dining
or
living
room
the
little
kitchen
was
on
the
left
with
its
door
wide
open
in
front
were
the
bedrooms
of
the
parents
and
the
children
charles
the
father
called
auguste
and
charles
one
eight
the
other
six
years
old
hastened
forward
followed
by
their
little
sister
lucille
who
was
four
they
were
handsome
children
in
whom
one
found
the
characteristics
of
the
father
and
the
mother
combined
the
younger
boy
appearing
more
intelligent
than
the
elder
one
and
the
little
girl
a
with
a
soft
laugh
already
looking
quite
pretty
when
marc
however
showed
the
copy
to
the
boys
and
questioned
them
madame
doloir
who
hitherto
had
not
spoken
a
word
hastily
intervened
me
monsieur
but
i
do
not
wish
my
children
to
answer
you
she
said
this
very
politely
without
the
slightest
sign
of
temper
like
a
good
mother
indeed
who
was
merely
fulfilling
her
duty
why
marc
asked
in
his
amazement
because
there
is
no
need
for
us
monsieur
to
meddle
in
an
affair
which
seems
likely
to
turn
out
very
badly
i
have
had
it
dinned
into
my
ears
ever
since
yesterday
morning
and
i
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
it
that
all
then
as
marc
insisted
and
began
to
defend
simon
she
retorted
say
nothing
against
monsieur
simon
the
children
have
never
had
to
complain
of
him
if
he
is
accused
let
him
defend
himself
that
is
his
business
for
my
part
i
have
always
tried
to
prevent
my
husband
from
meddling
in
politics
and
if
he
listens
to
me
he
will
hold
his
tongue
and
take
up
his
trowel
without
paying
any
attention
either
to
the
jews
or
to
the
priests
all
this
at
bottom
is
politics
again
she
never
went
to
church
although
she
had
caused
her
children
to
be
baptised
and
had
decided
to
let
them
take
their
first
communion
those
however
were
things
one
had
to
do
for
the
rest
she
simply
and
instinctively
held
conservative
views
accepting
things
as
they
were
accommodating
herself
to
her
narrow
life
for
she
was
terrified
by
the
thought
of
catastrophes
which
might
diminish
their
daily
bread
with
an
expression
of
stubborn
resolve
she
repeated
do
not
wish
any
of
us
to
be
compromised
those
words
were
decisive
doloir
himself
bowed
to
them
although
he
usually
allowed
his
wife
to
lead
him
he
did
not
like
her
to
exercise
her
power
before
others
but
this
time
he
submitted
did
not
reflect
monsieur
he
said
wife
is
right
it
is
best
for
poor
devils
like
us
to
keep
quiet
one
of
the
men
in
my
regiment
knew
all
sorts
of
things
about
the
captain
ah
they
did
not
stand
on
ceremony
with
him
you
should
have
seen
what
a
number
of
times
he
was
sent
to
the
cells
marc
like
the
husband
had
to
accept
the
position
and
so
renouncing
all
further
inquiry
there
he
merely
said
is
possible
that
the
judicial
authorities
may
ask
your
boys
what
i
desired
to
ask
them
in
that
case
they
will
have
to
answer
good
madame
doloir
answered
quietly
the
judicial
authorities
question
them
we
shall
see
what
they
ought
to
do
they
will
answer
or
not
it
will
all
depend
my
children
are
mine
and
it
is
my
business
marc
withdrew
escorted
by
doloir
who
was
in
a
hurry
to
return
to
his
work
when
they
reached
the
street
the
mason
almost
apologised
his
wife
was
not
always
easy
to
deal
with
he
remarked
but
when
she
said
the
right
thing
it
was
right
and
no
mistake
such
was
marc
discouragement
that
he
now
wondered
whether
it
would
be
worth
his
while
to
carry
the
inquiry
further
by
visiting
savin
the
clerk
in
the
doloirs
home
he
had
not
found
the
same
dense
ignorance
as
at
the
bongards
the
former
were
a
step
higher
in
the
social
scale
and
if
both
husband
and
wife
were
still
virtually
illiterate
they
at
least
came
in
contact
with
other
classes
and
knew
a
little
of
life
but
how
vague
was
still
the
dawn
which
they
typified
how
dim
was
the
groping
through
idiotic
egotism
in
what
disastrous
errors
did
lack
of
solidarity
maintain
the
poor
folk
of
that
class
if
they
were
not
happier
it
was
because
they
were
ignorant
of
every
right
condition
of
civic
life
of
the
necessity
that
others
should
be
happy
in
order
that
one
might
be
happy
oneself
marc
thought
of
that
human
house
the
doors
and
windows
of
which
people
have
striven
to
keep
closed
for
ages
whereas
they
ought
to
be
opened
widely
in
order
to
allow
air
and
warmth
and
light
to
enter
in
torrents
freely
while
he
was
thus
reflecting
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
rue
plaisir
and
reached
the
rue
fauche
where
the
savins
dwelt
he
thereupon
felt
ashamed
of
his
discouragement
so
he
climbed
the
stairs
to
their
flat
and
speedily
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
madame
savin
who
had
hastened
to
answer
his
ring
husband
monsieur
yes
as
it
happens
he
is
at
home
for
he
was
rather
feverish
this
morning
and
could
not
go
to
his
office
please
follow
me
she
was
charming
was
madame
savin
dark
refined
and
gay
with
a
pretty
laugh
and
so
also
though
her
year
was
already
past
that
she
seemed
to
be
the
elder
sister
of
her
four
children
the
firstborn
was
a
girl
hortense
followed
by
twin
boys
achille
and
philippe
and
then
by
another
boy
jules
whom
the
young
mother
was
still
nursing
it
was
said
that
her
husband
was
terribly
jealous
that
he
suspected
her
and
watched
her
ever
full
of
disquietude
although
she
gave
him
no
cause
for
it
a
by
trade
and
an
orphan
she
had
been
sought
by
him
in
marriage
for
her
beauty
sake
after
her
aunt
death
when
she
was
quite
alone
in
the
world
and
on
this
account
she
retained
a
feeling
of
gratitude
towards
him
and
conducted
herself
very
uprightly
like
a
good
wife
and
a
good
mother
just
as
she
was
about
to
usher
marc
into
the
adjoining
room
some
embarrassment
came
over
her
perhaps
she
feared
the
bad
temper
of
her
husband
who
was
ever
ready
to
pick
a
quarrel
and
to
whom
she
preferred
to
yield
for
the
sake
of
domestic
peace
name
am
i
to
give
monsieur
she
asked
marc
told
her
his
name
and
the
object
of
his
visit
whereupon
with
graceful
suppleness
she
glided
away
leaving
the
young
man
in
the
little
which
he
began
to
scrutinise
the
flat
was
composed
of
five
rooms
occupying
the
whole
of
that
floor
of
the
house
savin
a
petty
of
the
revenue
service
clerk
to
the
local
had
to
keep
up
his
rank
which
in
his
opinion
necessitated
a
certain
amount
of
outward
show
thus
his
wife
wore
bonnets
and
he
himself
never
went
out
otherwise
than
in
a
frock
coat
but
how
painful
were
the
straits
of
the
life
which
he
led
behind
that
façade
so
mendaciously
suggestive
of
class
superiority
and
easy
circumstances
the
bitterness
of
his
feelings
came
from
his
consciousness
that
he
was
bound
fast
to
his
humble
duties
that
he
had
no
prospect
whatever
of
advancement
but
was
condemned
for
life
to
toil
and
a
contemptible
salary
which
only
just
saved
him
from
starvation
poor
in
health
and
soured
humble
and
irritable
at
one
and
the
same
time
feeling
as
much
terror
as
rage
in
his
everlasting
anxiety
lest
he
might
displease
his
superiors
he
showed
himself
obsequious
and
cowardly
at
his
office
whilst
at
home
he
terrorised
his
wife
with
his
fits
of
passion
which
suggested
those
of
a
sickly
child
she
smiled
at
them
in
her
pretty
gentle
way
and
after
attending
to
the
children
and
the
household
she
found
a
means
to
work
for
a
firm
at
beaumont
very
delicate
and
work
which
provided
the
family
with
little
luxuries
but
her
husband
vexed
at
heart
such
was
his
pride
would
not
have
it
said
that
his
wife
was
forced
to
work
and
so
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
shut
herself
up
with
her
beads
and
deliver
her
work
by
stealth
for
a
moment
marc
heard
a
sharp
voice
speaking
angrily
then
after
a
gentle
murmur
silence
fell
and
madame
savin
reappeared
follow
me
monsieur
savin
scarcely
rose
from
the
in
which
he
was
nursing
his
attack
of
fever
a
village
schoolmaster
was
of
no
consequence
short
lean
and
puny
quite
bald
already
although
he
was
only
years
old
the
clerk
had
a
poor
cadaverous
countenance
with
slight
tired
features
light
eyes
and
a
very
scanty
beard
of
a
dirty
yellowish
tinge
he
finished
wearing
out
his
old
frock
coats
at
home
and
that
day
the
coloured
scarf
he
had
fastened
about
his
neck
helped
to
make
him
look
like
a
little
old
man
burdened
with
complaints
and
quite
neglectful
of
his
person
wife
tells
me
monsieur
he
said
you
have
called
about
that
abominable
affair
in
which
simon
the
schoolmaster
according
to
some
accounts
is
likely
to
be
compromised
and
my
first
impulse
i
confess
it
was
to
refuse
to
see
you
then
he
stopped
short
for
he
had
just
noticed
on
the
table
some
flowers
which
his
wife
had
been
making
as
she
sat
beside
him
while
he
perused
petit
he
gave
her
a
terrible
glance
which
she
understood
for
she
hastened
to
cover
her
work
with
the
newspaper
do
regard
me
as
a
reactionary
monsieur
savin
resumed
am
a
republican
in
fact
a
very
advanced
republican
i
do
not
hide
it
my
superiors
are
well
aware
of
it
when
one
serves
the
republic
it
is
only
honest
to
be
a
republican
is
it
not
briefly
i
am
on
the
side
of
the
government
for
and
in
all
things
compelled
to
listen
politely
marc
contented
himself
with
nodding
his
assent
views
on
the
religious
question
are
very
simple
savin
continued
priests
ought
to
remain
in
their
own
sphere
i
am
an
as
i
am
a
republican
but
i
hasten
to
add
that
in
my
opinion
a
religion
is
necessary
for
women
and
children
and
that
as
long
as
the
catholic
religion
is
that
of
the
country
why
we
may
as
well
have
that
one
as
another
thus
with
respect
to
my
wife
i
have
made
her
understand
that
it
is
fitting
and
necessary
for
a
woman
of
her
age
and
position
to
follow
the
observances
of
religion
in
order
that
she
may
have
a
rule
and
a
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
she
goes
to
the
capuchins
madame
savin
became
embarrassed
her
face
turned
pink
and
she
cast
down
her
eyes
that
question
of
religious
practices
had
long
been
a
great
source
of
unpleasantness
in
her
home
she
with
all
her
charming
delicacy
her
gentle
upright
heart
had
always
regarded
those
practices
with
repugnance
as
for
her
husband
he
wild
with
jealousy
ever
picking
quarrels
with
her
respecting
what
he
called
her
unfaithfulness
of
thought
looked
upon
confession
and
communion
solely
as
police
measures
moral
curbs
excellently
suited
to
restrain
women
from
descending
the
slope
which
leads
to
betrayal
and
his
wife
had
been
obliged
to
yield
to
him
in
the
matter
and
accept
the
confessor
whom
he
selected
the
bearded
father
théodose
though
with
her
instinct
she
divined
the
latter
to
be
a
man
of
a
horrid
nature
but
if
she
was
wounded
at
heart
and
blushed
with
offended
delicacy
she
none
the
less
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
continued
to
obey
her
husband
for
the
sake
of
domestic
quietude
for
my
children
monsieur
savin
was
now
saying
resources
have
not
enabled
me
to
send
achille
and
philippe
my
twin
sons
to
college
so
naturally
enough
i
have
sent
them
to
the
secular
school
in
accordance
with
my
duty
as
a
functionary
and
a
republican
in
the
same
way
my
daughter
hortense
goes
to
mademoiselle
rouzaire
but
at
bottom
i
am
well
pleased
to
find
that
that
lady
has
religious
sentiments
and
conducts
her
pupils
to
church
for
after
all
such
is
her
duty
and
i
should
complain
if
she
did
not
do
so
boys
always
pull
through
and
yet
if
i
did
not
owe
an
account
of
my
actions
to
my
superiors
would
it
not
have
been
more
advantageous
for
my
sons
if
i
had
sent
them
to
a
church
school
later
in
life
they
would
have
been
helped
on
placed
in
good
situations
supported
whereas
now
they
will
simply
vegetate
as
i
myself
have
vegetated
his
bitter
rancour
was
overflowing
and
seized
with
a
secret
dread
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
priests
you
see
are
the
stronger
and
in
spite
of
everything
one
ought
always
to
be
with
them
a
feeling
of
compassion
came
over
marc
that
poor
puny
trembling
being
driven
desperate
by
mediocrity
of
circumstances
and
foolishness
of
nature
seemed
to
him
in
sore
need
of
pity
foreseeing
the
conclusion
of
all
his
speeches
the
young
man
had
already
risen
so
monsieur
he
said
information
which
i
desired
to
obtain
from
your
children
children
are
not
here
savin
answered
lady
a
neighbour
has
taken
them
for
a
walk
but
even
if
they
were
here
ought
i
to
allow
them
to
answer
you
judge
for
yourself
a
functionary
can
in
no
case
take
sides
and
i
already
have
quite
enough
worries
at
my
office
without
incurring
any
responsibility
in
this
vile
affair
then
as
marc
hastily
bowed
he
added
the
jews
prey
on
our
land
of
france
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
that
monsieur
simon
unless
it
be
that
a
jew
ought
never
to
be
allowed
to
be
a
schoolmaster
i
hope
that
petit
will
start
a
campaign
on
that
subject
liberty
and
justice
for
all
such
ought
to
be
the
watchwords
of
a
good
republican
but
the
country
must
be
put
first
the
country
alone
must
be
considered
when
it
is
in
danger
is
that
not
so
madame
savin
who
since
marc
entry
into
the
room
had
not
spoken
a
word
escorted
the
young
man
to
the
door
of
the
flat
where
while
still
retaining
an
air
of
embarrassment
amid
her
submissiveness
that
of
a
superior
to
her
harsh
master
she
contented
herself
with
smiling
divinely
then
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
marc
encountered
the
children
whom
the
neighbour
was
bringing
home
hortense
the
girl
now
nine
years
old
was
already
a
pretty
and
coquettish
little
person
with
artful
eyes
which
gleamed
with
maliciousness
when
she
did
not
veil
them
with
the
expression
of
hypocritical
piety
which
she
had
learnt
to
acquire
at
mademoiselle
rouzaire
but
marc
was
more
interested
in
the
twin
boys
achille
and
philippe
two
thin
pale
lads
sickly
like
their
father
and
very
unruly
and
sly
for
their
seven
years
they
pushed
their
sister
against
the
banister
and
almost
made
her
fall
and
when
they
had
climbed
the
stairs
and
the
door
of
the
flat
opened
an
infant
wail
was
heard
that
of
little
jules
who
had
awoke
and
was
already
in
the
arms
of
his
mother
eager
for
her
breast
as
marc
walked
down
the
street
he
caught
himself
talking
aloud
so
they
were
all
agreed
from
the
ignorant
peasant
to
the
timid
and
idiotic
clerk
passing
by
way
of
the
brutified
workman
the
spoilt
fruit
of
and
the
salary
system
in
ascending
the
social
scale
one
merely
found
error
aggravated
by
narrow
egotism
and
base
cowardice
men
minds
remained
steeped
in
darkness
the
which
was
nowadays
acquired
without
method
and
which
reposed
on
no
serious
scientific
foundation
led
simply
to
a
poisoning
of
the
brain
to
a
state
of
disquieting
corruption
there
must
be
education
certainly
but
complete
education
whence
hypocrisy
and
falsehood
would
be
banished
education
which
would
free
the
mind
by
acquainting
it
with
truth
in
its
entirety
marc
trembled
at
the
thought
of
the
abyss
of
ignorance
error
and
hatred
which
opened
before
him
what
an
awful
bankruptcy
there
would
be
if
those
folk
were
needed
some
day
for
some
work
of
truth
and
justice
and
those
folk
typified
france
they
were
the
multitude
the
heavy
inert
mass
many
of
them
worthy
people
no
doubt
but
none
the
less
a
mass
of
lead
which
weighed
the
nation
down
to
the
ground
incapable
as
they
were
of
leading
a
better
life
of
becoming
free
just
and
truly
happy
because
they
were
steeped
in
ignorance
and
poison
as
marc
went
slowly
towards
the
school
to
acquaint
his
friend
simon
with
the
sad
result
of
his
visits
he
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
not
yet
called
on
the
mesdames
milhomme
the
stationers
of
the
rue
courte
and
although
he
anticipated
no
better
result
with
them
than
with
the
others
he
resolved
to
fulfil
his
commission
to
the
very
end
the
milhommes
the
ladies
husbands
had
been
two
brothers
born
at
maillebois
edouard
the
elder
had
inherited
a
little
stationery
business
from
an
uncle
and
being
of
a
and
unaspiring
disposition
had
made
a
shift
to
live
on
it
with
his
wife
while
his
younger
more
active
and
ambitious
brother
alexandre
laid
the
foundations
of
a
fortune
while
hurrying
about
the
country
as
a
commercial
traveller
but
death
swooped
down
on
both
the
elder
brother
was
the
first
to
die
as
the
result
of
a
tragic
accident
a
fall
into
a
cellar
the
second
succumbing
six
months
later
to
an
attack
of
pulmonary
congestion
while
he
was
at
the
other
end
of
france
their
widows
remained
one
with
her
humble
shop
the
other
with
a
capital
of
some
twenty
thousand
francs
the
first
savings
on
which
her
husband
had
hoped
to
rear
a
fortune
it
was
to
madame
edouard
a
woman
of
decision
and
diplomatic
skill
that
the
idea
occurred
of
inducing
her
madame
alexandre
to
enter
into
a
partnership
and
invest
her
twenty
thousand
francs
in
the
little
business
at
maillebois
which
might
be
increased
by
selling
books
stationery
and
other
articles
for
the
schools
each
of
the
two
widows
had
a
son
and
from
that
time
forward
the
mesdames
milhomme
as
they
were
called
madame
edouard
with
her
little
victor
and
madame
alexandre
with
her
little
sébastien
had
kept
house
together
living
in
the
close
intimacy
which
their
interests
required
although
their
natures
were
radically
different
madame
edouard
followed
the
observances
of
the
church
but
this
did
not
mean
that
her
faith
was
firm
she
simply
placed
the
requirements
of
her
business
before
everything
else
her
customers
were
chiefly
pious
folk
whom
she
did
not
wish
to
displease
madame
alexandre
on
the
contrary
had
given
up
at
the
time
of
her
marriage
for
her
husband
had
been
a
gay
companion
and
freethinker
and
she
refused
to
take
up
religion
again
it
was
madame
edouard
the
clever
diplomatist
who
ingeniously
indicated
that
these
divergencies
might
become
a
source
of
profit
their
business
was
spreading
their
shop
situated
midway
between
the
brothers
school
and
the
communal
school
supplied
articles
suitable
for
both
lesson
books
copybooks
diagrams
and
drawing
copies
without
speaking
of
pens
pencils
and
similar
things
thus
it
was
decided
that
each
of
the
two
women
should
retain
her
views
and
ways
the
one
with
the
priests
the
other
with
the
freethinkers
in
such
wise
as
to
satisfy
both
sides
and
in
order
that
nobody
might
remain
ignorant
of
the
understanding
sébastien
was
sent
to
the
secular
communal
school
where
simon
the
jew
was
master
while
victor
remained
at
the
brothers
school
matters
being
thus
settled
engineered
with
superior
skill
the
partnership
prospered
and
mesdames
milhomme
now
owned
one
of
the
most
thriving
shops
in
maillebois
marc
on
reaching
the
rue
courte
in
which
there
were
only
two
houses
the
milhommes
and
the
parsonage
slackened
his
steps
and
for
a
moment
examined
the
windows
of
the
stationery
shop
in
which
religious
prints
were
mingled
with
school
pictures
glorifying
the
republic
whilst
illustrated
newspapers
hanging
from
strings
almost
barred
the
doorway
he
was
about
to
enter
when
madame
alexandre
a
tall
and
blonde
whose
face
faded
already
though
she
was
only
thirty
was
still
lighted
by
a
faint
smile
appeared
upon
the
threshold
close
beside
her
was
her
little
sébastien
of
whom
she
was
very
fond
a
child
of
seven
fair
and
gentle
like
his
mother
very
handsome
also
with
blue
eyes
a
delicately
shaped
nose
and
a
mouth
bespeaking
amiability
madame
alexandre
was
acquainted
with
marc
and
she
at
once
referred
to
the
abominable
crime
which
seemed
to
haunt
her
dreadful
monsieur
froment
said
she
think
also
that
it
occurred
so
near
to
us
i
frequently
saw
poor
little
zéphirin
go
by
either
on
his
way
to
school
or
returning
home
and
he
often
came
here
to
buy
copybooks
and
pens
i
can
no
longer
sleep
since
i
saw
him
dead
then
she
spoke
compassionately
of
simon
and
his
grief
she
considered
him
to
be
very
and
upright
particularly
as
he
took
a
great
interest
in
her
little
sébastien
who
was
one
of
his
most
intelligent
and
docile
pupils
whatever
other
people
might
say
she
would
never
be
able
to
think
the
master
capable
of
such
a
frightful
deed
as
that
crime
as
for
the
of
which
people
talked
so
much
nothing
would
have
been
proved
even
if
similar
ones
had
been
found
in
the
school
sell
such
slips
you
know
monsieur
froment
she
continued
i
have
already
searched
through
those
which
we
have
in
stock
it
is
true
that
none
bear
those
particular
words
love
one
another
at
this
moment
sébastien
who
had
been
listening
attentively
raised
his
head
saw
one
like
that
said
he
cousin
victor
brought
one
home
from
the
brothers
school
there
were
those
words
on
it
his
mother
appeared
stupefied
are
you
saying
she
exclaimed
never
mentioned
that
to
me
you
did
not
ask
besides
victor
forbade
me
to
tell
because
forbidden
to
take
the
from
school
where
is
that
one
i
do
know
victor
hid
it
somewhere
so
that
he
might
not
be
scolded
marc
was
following
the
scene
astonished
delighted
his
heart
beating
fast
with
hope
was
the
truth
about
to
come
forth
from
the
mouth
of
that
child
perchance
this
would
prove
the
feeble
ray
which
spreads
little
by
little
until
it
finally
expands
into
a
great
blaze
of
light
and
the
young
man
was
already
putting
precise
and
decisive
questions
to
sébastien
when
madame
edouard
accompanied
by
victor
appeared
upon
the
scene
she
was
returning
from
a
visit
which
she
had
just
made
to
brother
fulgence
under
the
pretext
of
applying
for
the
payment
of
a
stationery
account
taller
than
her
madame
edouard
was
dark
with
a
massive
face
and
a
masculine
appearance
her
gestures
were
quick
her
speech
was
loud
a
good
and
honest
woman
in
her
way
she
would
not
have
wronged
her
partner
of
a
though
she
never
hesitated
to
domineer
over
her
she
indeed
was
the
man
in
the
household
and
the
other
as
a
means
of
defence
only
possessed
her
force
of
inertia
her
very
gentleness
of
which
she
availed
herself
at
times
for
weeks
and
months
together
thereby
often
securing
the
victory
as
for
victor
madame
edouard
son
he
was
a
sturdy
lad
nine
years
of
age
with
a
big
dark
head
and
massive
face
quite
a
contrast
indeed
to
his
cousin
sébastien
directly
madame
edouard
was
apprised
of
the
situation
she
looked
at
her
son
severely
a
copy
you
stole
a
copy
from
the
brothers
and
brought
it
here
victor
had
already
turned
a
glance
of
despair
and
fury
upon
sébastien
no
mamma
he
answered
you
did
for
your
cousin
saw
it
he
does
not
usually
tell
falsehoods
the
boy
ceased
answering
but
he
still
cast
terrible
glances
at
his
cousin
and
the
latter
was
by
no
means
at
his
ease
for
he
well
knew
the
physical
strength
of
his
playmate
and
commonly
represented
the
vanquished
beaten
enemy
whenever
they
had
a
game
at
war
together
under
the
elder
guidance
there
were
endless
noisy
gallops
through
the
house
the
younger
so
gentle
by
nature
letting
himself
be
led
into
them
with
a
kind
of
rapturous
terror
doubt
he
did
not
steal
it
madame
alexandre
observed
indulgently
he
only
brought
it
home
by
mistake
in
order
that
his
cousin
might
the
more
readily
forgive
his
indiscretion
sébastien
at
once
confirmed
this
suggestion
course
it
was
like
that
i
did
not
say
he
stole
it
madame
edouard
having
now
calmed
down
ceased
to
exact
an
immediate
answer
from
victor
who
remained
silent
as
if
stubbornly
resolved
upon
making
no
confession
his
mother
for
her
part
doubtless
reflected
that
it
would
be
scarcely
prudent
to
investigate
the
matter
in
a
stranger
presence
without
weighing
the
gravity
of
the
consequences
she
pictured
herself
taking
one
or
the
other
side
in
the
affair
and
setting
either
the
brothers
school
or
the
communal
school
against
her
thereby
losing
one
set
of
customers
so
after
casting
a
domineering
glance
at
madame
alexandre
she
contented
herself
with
saying
to
her
son
will
do
go
indoors
monsieur
we
will
settle
all
this
by
and
by
just
reflect
and
if
you
do
not
tell
me
the
real
truth
i
shall
know
what
to
do
to
you
then
turning
to
marc
she
added
will
tell
you
what
he
says
monsieur
and
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
he
will
soon
speak
unless
he
desires
such
a
whipping
as
he
is
not
likely
to
forget
marc
could
not
insist
any
further
however
ardent
might
be
his
desire
to
learn
the
whole
truth
immediately
in
order
that
he
might
convey
it
to
simon
like
tidings
of
deliverance
but
he
no
longer
felt
a
doubt
respecting
the
genuineness
of
the
decisive
fact
the
triumphant
proof
which
chance
had
placed
in
his
hands
so
he
at
once
hastened
to
his
friend
to
tell
him
of
his
successive
repulses
with
the
bongards
the
doloirs
and
the
savins
and
of
the
discovery
which
he
made
at
the
milhommes
simon
listened
quietly
showing
no
sign
of
the
delight
which
marc
had
anticipated
ah
there
were
similar
copies
at
the
brothers
school
well
he
was
not
astonished
to
hear
it
for
his
own
part
why
should
he
worry
as
he
was
innocent
thank
you
very
much
for
all
the
trouble
you
have
taken
my
good
friend
he
added
i
fully
understand
the
importance
of
that
child
statement
but
i
can
not
accustom
myself
to
the
idea
that
my
fate
depends
on
what
may
be
said
or
what
may
not
be
said
considering
that
i
am
guilty
of
nothing
to
my
thinking
that
is
as
evident
as
the
sun
in
the
skies
marc
who
felt
quite
enlivened
began
to
laugh
he
now
shared
his
friend
confidence
and
after
they
had
chatted
for
a
moment
he
took
his
leave
but
suddenly
returned
to
ask
handsome
mauraisin
been
to
see
you
i
have
not
seen
him
simon
answered
that
case
my
friend
he
must
have
wished
to
ascertain
the
opinions
of
all
maillebois
before
coming
i
caught
sight
of
him
this
morning
first
with
father
crabot
and
afterwards
with
mademoiselle
rouzaire
while
i
was
running
about
this
afternoon
too
i
fancied
i
saw
him
twice
once
slipping
into
the
ruelle
des
capucins
and
then
as
it
seemed
to
me
on
his
way
to
the
mayor
he
must
have
been
making
inquiries
in
order
to
be
sure
of
taking
the
stronger
side
simon
hitherto
so
calm
made
a
nervous
gesture
for
timid
by
nature
he
regarded
his
superiors
with
respect
and
fear
indeed
his
sole
personal
worry
in
the
catastrophe
was
the
possibility
of
a
great
scandal
which
might
cost
him
his
situation
or
at
least
cause
him
to
be
regarded
very
unfavourably
by
the
officials
of
his
department
and
he
was
about
to
confess
this
apprehension
to
marc
when
as
it
happened
mauraisin
presented
himself
looking
frigid
and
thoughtful
monsieur
simon
i
have
hastened
here
on
account
of
that
horrible
affair
i
am
in
despair
for
the
school
for
all
of
you
and
for
ourselves
it
is
very
serious
very
serious
very
serious
as
he
spoke
the
elementary
inspector
drew
up
his
little
figure
and
his
words
fell
from
his
lips
with
increasing
severity
in
a
formal
way
he
had
shaken
hands
with
marc
knowing
that
le
barazer
the
academy
inspector
his
superior
was
partial
to
the
young
man
but
he
looked
at
him
askance
through
his
glasses
as
if
to
invite
him
to
withdraw
and
marc
could
not
linger
although
it
worried
him
to
leave
simon
alone
with
that
man
on
whom
his
position
depended
and
before
whom
he
now
trembled
he
who
had
shown
so
much
courage
ever
since
the
morning
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
so
marc
went
home
full
of
the
new
impression
that
had
come
to
him
the
covert
hostility
of
that
man
mauraisin
whom
he
divined
to
be
a
traitor
the
evening
spent
with
the
ladies
proved
very
quiet
neither
madame
duparque
nor
madame
berthereau
referred
to
the
crime
and
the
little
house
fell
asleep
peacefully
as
if
nought
of
the
tragedy
in
progress
elsewhere
had
ever
entered
it
marc
had
thought
it
prudent
to
say
nothing
about
his
busy
afternoon
on
going
to
bed
he
contented
himself
with
telling
his
wife
that
he
felt
quite
at
ease
with
reference
to
his
friend
simon
the
news
pleased
geneviève
and
they
then
continued
chatting
until
rather
late
for
in
the
daytime
they
were
never
alone
together
never
able
to
speak
freely
in
such
wise
that
they
seemed
to
be
strangers
when
they
fell
asleep
in
each
other
arms
it
was
as
if
they
had
been
blissfully
reunited
after
a
positive
separation
but
in
the
morning
marc
was
painfully
astonished
to
find
an
abominable
article
against
simon
in
petit
he
remembered
the
paragraph
of
the
previous
day
which
had
expressed
so
much
sympathy
with
the
schoolmaster
and
had
covered
him
with
praise
hours
had
sufficed
to
effect
a
complete
change
and
now
with
a
wonderful
show
of
perfidious
suppositions
and
false
interpretations
of
the
facts
the
jew
was
savagely
sacrificed
plainly
accused
of
the
ignoble
crime
what
could
have
happened
then
what
powerful
influence
could
have
been
at
work
whence
came
that
poisoned
article
drafted
so
carefully
in
order
that
the
jew
might
be
for
ever
condemned
by
the
ignorant
populace
athirst
for
falsehood
that
newspaper
melodrama
with
its
mysterious
intricacies
its
extraordinary
improbabilities
would
prove
marc
felt
it
a
legend
changing
into
truth
positive
truth
from
which
people
henceforth
would
refuse
to
depart
and
when
the
young
man
had
finished
his
perusal
he
again
became
conscious
of
some
secret
working
in
the
gloom
some
immense
work
which
mysterious
forces
had
been
accomplishing
since
the
previous
day
in
order
to
ruin
the
innocent
and
thereby
save
the
unknown
culprit
yet
no
fresh
incident
had
occurred
the
magistrates
had
not
returned
to
maillebois
there
was
still
only
the
gendarmes
guarding
the
chamber
of
the
crime
where
lay
the
remains
of
the
poor
little
victim
awaiting
burial
the
examination
on
the
previous
day
had
merely
confirmed
the
facts
which
were
already
known
after
a
scene
of
horror
zéphirin
had
been
killed
by
strangulation
as
was
indicated
by
the
deep
violet
around
his
neck
it
had
been
settled
that
the
funeral
should
take
place
that
afternoon
and
according
to
report
preparations
were
being
made
to
invest
it
with
avenging
solemnity
the
authorities
were
to
be
present
as
well
as
all
the
marc
whom
anxiety
assailed
once
more
spent
a
gloomy
morning
he
did
not
go
to
see
simon
for
he
thought
it
best
to
do
so
in
the
evening
after
the
funeral
he
contented
himself
with
strolling
through
maillebois
which
he
found
drowsy
as
if
gorged
with
horrors
while
waiting
for
the
promised
spectacle
after
his
walk
the
young
spirits
revived
and
he
was
finishing
lunch
with
the
ladies
amused
by
the
prattle
of
little
louise
who
was
very
lively
that
day
when
pélagie
on
entering
the
room
with
a
fine
plum
tart
found
herself
unable
to
restrain
her
rapturous
delight
madame
she
exclaimed
are
arresting
that
brigand
of
a
jew
at
last
it
none
too
soon
are
arresting
simon
how
do
you
know
it
exclaimed
marc
who
had
turned
very
pale
everybody
says
so
monsieur
the
butcher
across
the
road
has
just
gone
off
to
see
it
marc
flung
down
his
napkin
rose
and
went
out
without
touching
any
tart
the
ladies
were
aghast
deeply
offended
by
such
a
breach
of
good
manners
even
geneviève
seemed
to
be
displeased
is
losing
his
senses
said
madame
duparque
dryly
my
dear
girl
i
warned
you
without
religion
no
happiness
is
possible
when
marc
reached
the
street
he
immediately
realised
that
something
extraordinary
was
taking
place
all
the
shopkeepers
were
at
their
doors
some
people
were
running
while
an
uproar
of
shouts
and
jeers
was
to
be
heard
hastening
his
steps
marc
turned
into
the
rue
courte
and
there
he
at
once
perceived
the
mesdames
milhomme
and
their
children
assembled
on
the
threshold
of
the
stationery
shop
they
also
were
deeply
interested
in
the
great
event
and
marc
then
remembered
that
there
was
some
good
evidence
to
be
obtained
there
of
which
he
had
better
make
sure
immediately
it
true
he
asked
monsieur
simon
being
arrested
yes
monsieur
froment
madame
alexandre
replied
in
her
gentle
way
have
just
seen
the
commissary
pass
it
is
certain
you
know
said
madame
edouard
in
her
turn
looking
him
straight
in
the
face
and
anticipating
the
question
which
she
had
already
read
in
his
eyes
is
quite
certain
that
victor
never
had
that
pretended
i
have
questioned
him
and
i
am
convinced
that
he
is
telling
no
falsehood
the
boy
raised
his
face
with
its
square
chin
and
large
eyes
full
of
quiet
impudence
of
course
i
am
not
telling
a
falsehood
he
said
amazed
chilled
to
the
heart
marc
turned
to
madame
alexandre
what
was
it
your
son
said
madame
he
saw
that
copy
in
his
hands
he
declared
it
the
mother
appeared
ill
at
ease
and
did
not
immediately
answer
her
little
sébastien
had
already
taken
refuge
in
her
skirts
as
if
to
hide
his
face
and
she
with
a
quivering
hand
fondled
his
hair
covered
his
head
anxiously
and
protectingly
doubt
monsieur
froment
she
at
last
responded
saw
it
or
rather
he
fancied
he
saw
it
at
present
he
is
not
very
sure
he
thinks
he
may
have
been
mistaken
and
so
you
see
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
unwilling
to
insist
with
the
women
marc
addressed
himself
to
the
little
boy
it
true
that
you
did
not
see
the
copy
there
is
nothing
so
wicked
as
a
lie
my
child
sébastien
instead
of
answering
pressed
his
face
more
closely
to
his
mother
skirt
and
burst
into
sobs
it
was
evident
that
madame
edouard
like
a
good
trader
who
feared
that
by
taking
any
particular
side
in
the
conflict
she
might
lose
a
part
of
her
custom
had
imposed
her
will
upon
the
others
she
was
as
firm
as
a
rock
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
move
her
however
she
condescended
to
indicate
the
reasons
by
which
she
was
guided
monsieur
froment
she
said
are
against
nobody
you
know
we
need
everybody
help
in
our
business
only
it
must
be
admitted
that
all
the
appearances
are
against
monsieur
simon
take
for
instance
that
train
which
he
says
he
missed
that
return
ticket
which
he
threw
away
in
the
station
yard
that
walk
when
he
met
nobody
besides
mademoiselle
rouzaire
is
positive
that
she
heard
a
noise
about
twenty
minutes
to
eleven
whereas
he
pretends
that
he
did
not
return
till
an
hour
later
explain
too
how
it
happened
that
monsieur
mignot
had
to
go
and
wake
him
when
it
was
nearly
eight
in
the
morning
he
who
is
usually
up
so
early
well
perhaps
he
will
justify
himself
for
his
sake
let
us
hope
so
marc
stopped
her
with
a
gesture
she
was
repeating
what
he
had
read
in
petit
and
he
was
terrified
by
it
he
cast
a
keen
glance
on
both
women
the
one
who
so
resolutely
silenced
her
conscience
the
other
who
trembled
from
head
to
foot
and
he
himself
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
their
sudden
falsehood
which
might
lead
to
such
disastrous
consequences
then
he
left
them
and
hastened
to
simon
a
closed
vehicle
guarded
by
two
officers
was
waiting
at
the
door
the
orders
were
stringent
but
marc
at
last
contrived
to
enter
while
two
other
officers
guarded
simon
in
the
classroom
the
commissary
of
police
who
had
arrived
with
a
warrant
signed
by
investigating
magistrate
daix
conducted
a
fresh
and
very
minute
perquisition
through
the
whole
house
seeking
no
doubt
for
copies
of
the
famous
writing
slip
but
he
found
nothing
and
when
marc
ventured
to
ask
one
of
the
officers
if
a
similar
perquisition
had
taken
place
at
the
school
kept
by
the
brothers
of
the
christian
doctrine
the
man
looked
at
him
in
amazement
a
perquisition
at
the
good
school
what
for
indeed
but
marc
was
already
shrugging
his
shoulders
at
his
own
simplicity
for
even
supposing
that
the
officers
had
gone
to
the
brothers
the
latter
had
been
allowed
ample
time
to
burn
and
destroy
everything
likely
to
compromise
them
the
young
man
had
to
exert
all
his
powers
of
restraint
to
prevent
himself
from
expressing
his
feelings
of
revolt
his
powerlessness
to
demonstrate
the
truth
filled
him
with
despair
for
yet
another
hour
he
had
to
remain
in
the
hall
waiting
for
the
finish
of
the
search
at
last
just
as
the
officers
were
about
to
remove
simon
he
was
able
to
see
him
for
a
moment
madame
simon
and
her
two
children
were
there
also
and
she
flung
herself
sobbing
about
her
neck
while
the
commissary
a
rough
but
not
man
made
a
pretence
of
giving
some
last
orders
there
came
a
most
scene
simon
livid
crushed
by
the
downfall
of
his
life
strove
to
preserve
great
calmness
not
grieve
my
darling
he
said
can
only
be
an
error
an
abominable
error
everything
will
certainly
be
explained
as
soon
as
i
am
interrogated
and
i
shall
soon
return
to
you
but
rachel
sobbed
yet
more
violently
with
a
wild
expression
on
her
face
while
she
raised
the
poor
little
ones
joseph
and
sarah
in
order
that
their
father
might
kiss
them
once
again
yes
the
poor
children
love
them
well
take
good
care
of
them
until
my
return
and
i
beg
you
do
not
weep
so
you
will
deprive
me
of
all
my
courage
he
tore
himself
from
her
clasp
and
then
at
the
sight
of
marc
his
eyes
sparkled
with
infinite
joy
he
quickly
grasped
the
hand
which
the
young
man
offered
him
comrade
thank
you
let
my
brother
david
be
warned
at
once
be
sure
to
tell
him
i
am
innocent
he
will
seek
everywhere
he
will
find
the
culprit
it
is
to
him
that
i
confide
my
honour
and
my
children
easy
replied
marc
with
emotion
will
help
him
but
the
commissary
now
returned
and
put
an
end
to
the
it
was
necessary
that
madame
simon
wild
with
grief
should
be
removed
at
the
moment
when
simon
was
led
away
by
the
two
officers
what
followed
was
monstrous
the
hour
fixed
for
the
funeral
of
little
zéphirin
was
three
and
in
order
to
prevent
any
regrettable
collision
it
had
been
decided
to
arrest
simon
at
one
but
the
perquisition
had
lasted
so
long
that
the
very
thing
which
the
authorities
had
wished
to
prevent
took
place
when
simon
appeared
outside
on
the
little
flight
of
steps
the
square
was
already
crowded
with
people
who
had
come
to
see
the
funeral
procession
and
this
crowd
which
had
gorged
itself
with
the
tales
of
petit
and
which
was
still
stirred
by
the
horror
of
the
crime
raised
angry
shouts
as
soon
as
it
perceived
the
schoolmaster
that
accursed
jew
that
slayer
of
little
children
who
for
his
abominable
witchery
needed
their
virgin
blood
whilst
it
was
yet
sanctified
by
the
presence
of
the
host
that
was
the
legend
never
to
be
destroyed
which
sped
from
mouth
to
mouth
maddening
the
tumultuous
and
menacing
crowd
death
to
death
with
the
murderer
and
sacrilegist
to
death
to
death
with
the
jew
chilled
to
his
bones
paler
and
yet
more
rigid
than
before
simon
from
the
top
of
the
steps
responded
by
a
cry
which
henceforth
came
without
cessation
from
his
lips
as
if
it
were
the
very
voice
of
his
conscience
am
innocent
i
am
innocent
then
rage
transported
the
throng
the
hoots
ascended
tempestuously
a
huge
human
wave
bounded
forward
to
seize
the
accursed
wretch
and
throw
him
down
and
tear
him
into
shreds
death
to
death
with
the
jew
but
the
officers
had
quickly
pushed
simon
into
the
waiting
vehicle
and
the
driver
urged
his
horse
into
a
fast
trot
while
the
prisoner
never
tiring
repeated
his
cry
in
accents
which
rose
above
the
tempest
am
innocent
i
am
innocent
i
am
innocent
all
the
way
down
the
high
street
the
crowd
rushed
howling
louder
and
louder
behind
the
vehicle
and
marc
who
had
remained
in
the
square
dazed
and
full
of
anguish
began
to
think
of
the
other
demonstration
the
indignant
murmurs
the
explosion
of
revolt
which
had
attended
the
end
of
the
at
the
brothers
school
two
days
previously
barely
hours
had
sufficed
for
a
complete
revulsion
of
public
opinion
and
he
was
terrified
by
the
abominable
skill
the
cruel
promptitude
displayed
by
the
mysterious
hands
which
had
gathered
so
much
darkness
together
his
hopes
had
crumbled
he
felt
that
truth
was
obscured
defeated
in
peril
of
death
never
before
had
he
experienced
such
intense
distress
of
mind
but
the
procession
for
little
zéphirin
funeral
was
already
being
formed
marc
saw
the
devout
mademoiselle
rouzaire
bringing
up
the
girls
of
her
class
after
witnessing
simon
calvary
without
making
even
a
gesture
of
sympathy
nor
had
mignot
who
was
surrounded
by
some
of
the
boys
gone
to
press
his
superior
hand
he
stood
there
sullen
and
embarrassed
suffering
no
doubt
from
the
struggle
between
his
good
nature
and
his
interests
at
last
the
procession
started
directing
its
steps
towards
martin
amidst
extraordinary
pomp
again
one
realised
how
carefully
artful
hands
had
organised
everything
in
order
to
move
the
people
excite
its
pity
and
its
desire
for
vengeance
on
either
side
of
the
little
coffin
walked
those
of
zéphirin
who
had
taken
their
first
communion
at
the
same
time
as
himself
next
appeared
darras
the
mayor
attended
by
the
other
authorities
and
acting
as
chief
mourner
then
came
all
the
pupils
of
the
brothers
school
led
by
brother
fulgence
with
his
three
assistants
brothers
isidore
lazarus
and
gorgias
the
important
airs
which
brother
fulgence
gave
himself
were
much
remarked
he
came
went
and
commanded
on
all
sides
going
even
so
far
in
his
agitation
as
to
meddle
with
mademoiselle
rouzaire
pupils
as
though
they
were
under
his
orders
and
several
capuchins
were
also
present
with
their
superior
father
théodose
and
there
were
jesuits
from
the
college
of
valmarie
headed
by
their
rector
father
crabot
together
with
priests
who
had
come
from
all
the
surrounding
districts
such
a
gathering
of
gowns
and
cassocks
indeed
that
the
whole
church
of
the
region
seemed
to
have
been
mobilised
in
order
to
ensure
itself
a
triumph
by
claiming
as
its
own
the
poor
little
body
which
amid
that
splendid
procession
was
now
being
carried
to
the
grave
sobs
burst
forth
along
the
whole
line
of
route
and
furious
cries
resounded
to
the
jews
death
to
the
dirty
jews
a
final
incident
completed
marc
enlightenment
while
with
his
heart
full
of
bitterness
he
continued
to
watch
the
scene
he
caught
sight
of
inspector
mauraisin
who
as
on
the
previous
day
had
come
from
beaumont
to
ascertain
no
doubt
what
might
be
his
best
line
of
conduct
and
when
father
crabot
passed
marc
saw
that
he
and
mauraisin
exchanged
a
smile
and
a
discreet
salutation
like
men
who
understood
each
other
and
regarded
each
other
conduct
with
approval
all
the
monstrous
iniquity
woven
in
the
gloom
during
the
last
two
days
then
appeared
to
marc
under
the
clear
sky
while
the
bells
of
rang
out
in
honour
of
the
poor
little
boy
whose
tragic
fate
was
about
to
be
so
impudently
exploited
but
a
rough
hand
was
laid
on
marc
shoulder
and
some
words
addressed
to
him
in
a
tone
of
bitter
irony
caused
him
to
look
round
what
did
i
tell
you
my
worthy
and
simple
colleague
the
dirty
jew
is
convicted
of
villainy
and
murder
and
while
he
travels
to
beaumont
gaol
all
the
good
brothers
are
triumphing
it
was
férou
who
spoke
férou
the
rebellious
starveling
schoolmaster
looking
more
gawky
than
ever
with
his
hair
all
in
disorder
his
long
bony
head
and
his
big
sneering
mouth
can
they
be
accused
he
continued
the
little
victim
belongs
to
them
to
them
alone
ah
it
certain
that
nobody
will
dare
to
accuse
them
for
all
maillebois
has
seen
them
take
him
to
the
grave
in
grand
procession
the
amusing
thing
is
the
buzzing
of
that
ridiculous
black
fly
that
idiotic
brother
fulgence
who
knocks
up
against
everybody
he
over
zealous
but
you
must
have
also
seen
father
crabot
with
his
shrewd
smile
which
doubtless
hides
no
little
stupidity
whatever
may
be
his
reputation
for
skilfulness
at
all
events
remember
what
i
tell
you
the
cleverest
the
only
really
clever
one
among
them
all
is
certainly
father
philibin
who
pretends
to
look
like
a
big
booby
you
may
search
for
him
but
you
wo
find
him
there
it
was
likely
that
he
would
come
to
maillebois
keeping
himself
in
the
background
and
you
may
be
sure
that
he
doing
some
fine
work
ah
i
do
know
exactly
who
the
culprit
may
be
he
is
certainly
none
of
those
but
he
belongs
to
their
shop
that
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
and
they
will
overturn
everything
rather
than
give
him
up
then
as
marc
still
overcome
remained
silent
merely
nodding
férou
went
on
they
regard
it
as
a
fine
opportunity
to
crush
the
freethinkers
a
communal
schoolmaster
guilty
of
abomination
and
murder
what
a
splendid
they
will
soon
settle
our
hash
rogues
that
we
are
without
god
or
country
yes
death
to
the
traitors
who
sold
themselves
death
to
the
dirty
jews
waving
his
long
arms
férou
went
off
into
the
crowd
as
he
was
wont
to
say
with
his
excessive
jeering
bitterness
it
mattered
little
to
him
at
bottom
whether
he
ended
by
being
burnt
at
the
stake
in
a
shirt
dipped
in
brimstone
or
whether
he
starved
to
death
in
his
wretched
school
at
le
moreux
that
evening
when
after
a
silent
dinner
in
the
ladies
company
marc
found
himself
alone
again
with
geneviève
she
observing
his
despair
lovingly
passed
her
arms
about
him
and
burst
into
tears
he
felt
deeply
moved
for
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
day
as
if
their
bond
of
union
had
been
slightly
shaken
as
if
severance
were
beginning
he
pressed
her
to
his
heart
and
for
a
long
time
they
both
wept
without
exchanging
a
word
at
last
hesitating
somewhat
she
said
to
him
my
dear
marc
i
think
we
should
do
well
to
shorten
our
stay
with
grandmother
we
might
go
away
surprised
by
these
words
he
questioned
her
she
had
enough
of
us
then
were
you
told
to
signify
it
to
me
no
no
on
the
contrary
it
would
grieve
mamma
we
should
have
to
invent
a
pretext
get
somebody
to
send
us
a
telegram
in
that
case
why
should
we
not
spend
our
full
month
here
as
usual
we
have
some
little
differences
together
no
doubt
but
i
complain
for
a
moment
geneviève
remained
embarrassed
she
did
not
dare
to
confess
her
anxiety
at
the
thought
that
something
had
seemed
to
be
detaching
her
from
her
husband
that
evening
in
the
atmosphere
of
devout
hostility
in
which
she
lived
at
her
grandmother
she
had
felt
indeed
as
if
the
ideas
and
feelings
of
her
girlhood
were
returning
and
clashing
with
the
life
which
she
led
as
wife
and
mother
but
all
that
was
merely
the
faint
touch
of
the
past
and
her
gaiety
and
confidence
soon
returned
amid
marc
caresses
near
her
in
the
cradle
she
could
hear
the
gentle
and
regular
breathing
of
her
little
louise
are
right
she
said
us
stay
and
do
your
duty
as
you
understand
it
we
love
each
other
too
well
to
be
otherwise
than
happy
always
iii
from
that
time
forward
in
order
to
avoid
painful
quarrels
nothing
more
was
said
of
the
affaire
simon
in
the
ladies
little
house
at
meals
they
spoke
merely
of
the
fine
weather
as
if
they
were
a
thousand
leagues
from
maillebois
where
the
popular
passions
raged
more
and
more
tempestuously
old
friends
of
thirty
years
standing
and
even
relatives
quarrelling
threatening
one
another
and
exchanging
blows
marc
who
in
the
home
of
geneviève
family
displayed
such
silence
and
lack
of
interest
became
elsewhere
one
of
the
most
ardent
combatants
an
heroic
worker
in
the
cause
of
truth
and
justice
on
the
evening
of
the
day
when
simon
was
arrested
he
had
persuaded
his
colleague
wife
to
seek
an
asylum
with
her
parents
the
lehmanns
those
tailors
who
dwelt
in
a
little
dark
house
of
the
rue
du
trou
it
was
the
school
was
closed
and
besides
mignot
the
remained
to
guard
the
building
that
is
when
he
was
not
fishing
in
the
verpille
moreover
mademoiselle
rouzaire
who
wished
to
take
part
in
the
affair
in
which
her
evidence
was
likely
to
prove
important
had
also
remained
at
her
post
renouncing
on
this
occasion
the
holiday
visit
which
she
usually
paid
to
an
aunt
dwelling
at
a
distance
thus
madame
simon
leaving
her
furniture
behind
in
order
that
folk
might
not
regard
her
departure
as
terrified
flight
and
a
tacit
acknowledgment
of
guilt
had
taken
joseph
and
sarah
to
the
rue
du
trou
with
a
single
trunk
of
clothes
as
if
she
merely
intended
to
stay
with
her
parents
for
a
few
weeks
from
that
moment
marc
visited
the
lehmanns
almost
daily
the
rue
du
trou
which
opened
into
the
rue
du
plaisir
was
one
of
the
most
sordid
streets
of
the
poor
quarter
of
maillebois
and
the
lehmanns
house
was
composed
merely
of
a
dark
shop
and
a
still
darker
shop
parlour
on
the
ground
floor
then
three
rooms
reached
by
a
black
staircase
at
the
very
top
of
which
was
a
spacious
garret
this
last
being
the
only
part
of
the
house
which
the
sunrays
occasionally
entered
the
damp
greenish
shop
parlour
served
as
a
kitchen
and
living
room
rachel
took
possession
of
the
dismal
bedroom
of
her
girlhood
and
the
old
people
contented
themselves
with
one
chamber
the
third
being
given
to
the
children
who
were
also
allowed
the
run
of
the
garret
which
made
them
a
gay
and
spacious
playroom
marc
constantly
felt
surprised
that
such
an
admirable
woman
as
rachel
one
of
so
rare
a
beauty
should
have
sprung
in
such
a
horrid
den
from
needy
parents
weighed
down
by
a
long
heredity
of
anxious
penury
lehmann
her
father
was
at
five
and
fifty
a
jew
of
the
classic
type
short
and
insignificant
with
a
large
nose
blinking
eyes
and
a
thick
grey
beard
which
hid
his
mouth
his
calling
had
distorted
him
he
had
one
shoulder
higher
than
the
other
and
a
kind
of
anxious
discomfort
of
body
was
thus
added
to
his
humility
his
wife
who
plied
her
needle
from
morning
till
night
hid
herself
away
in
his
shadow
being
yet
more
retiring
in
her
humility
and
silent
disquietude
they
led
a
narrow
life
full
of
difficulties
earning
a
scanty
subsistence
by
dint
of
hard
work
for
customers
such
as
the
few
israelites
of
the
region
who
were
in
easy
circumstances
and
certain
christians
who
did
not
spend
much
money
on
their
clothes
the
gold
of
france
with
which
the
jews
were
said
to
gorge
themselves
was
certainly
not
piled
up
there
indeed
a
feeling
of
great
compassion
came
to
one
at
the
sight
of
those
poor
weary
old
people
who
were
ever
trembling
lest
somebody
should
deprive
them
of
the
bread
which
cost
them
so
much
toil
at
the
lehmanns
however
marc
became
acquainted
with
simon
brother
david
whom
a
telegram
had
summoned
on
the
day
of
the
arrest
taller
and
stronger
than
simon
whose
senior
he
was
by
three
years
david
had
a
full
firm
face
with
bright
and
energetic
eyes
after
his
death
he
had
entered
the
army
in
which
he
had
served
for
twelve
years
rising
from
the
ranks
to
a
lieutenancy
and
after
innumerable
struggles
and
rebuffs
being
it
seemed
near
promotion
to
the
rank
of
captain
when
he
suddenly
sent
in
his
papers
lacking
the
courage
to
contend
any
longer
against
the
affronts
to
which
his
comrades
and
superiors
subjected
him
because
he
was
a
jew
this
had
taken
place
some
five
years
before
the
crime
of
maillebois
at
the
time
when
simon
was
about
to
marry
rachel
david
who
remained
a
bachelor
looked
round
him
for
occupation
and
like
a
man
of
initiative
and
energy
embarked
in
an
enterprise
of
which
nobody
had
previously
thought
this
was
the
working
of
some
very
extensive
sand
and
gravel
pits
on
the
estate
of
la
désirade
which
then
still
belonged
to
the
millionaire
banker
baron
nathan
the
latter
taken
with
the
young
man
energy
and
sense
granted
him
a
thirty
years
lease
on
fairly
low
terms
and
thus
david
was
soon
on
the
high
road
to
fortune
for
in
three
years
he
earned
a
hundred
thousand
francs
in
this
enterprise
which
steadily
increased
in
magnitude
and
at
last
absorbed
every
hour
of
his
time
but
on
hearing
of
the
charge
brought
against
his
brother
he
did
not
hesitate
he
placed
his
business
in
the
hands
of
a
foreman
on
whom
he
could
rely
and
hurried
to
maillebois
he
did
not
for
a
moment
doubt
his
brother
innocence
it
was
materially
impossible
he
felt
that
such
a
deed
could
be
the
act
of
such
a
man
the
one
whom
he
knew
best
in
all
the
world
who
was
indeed
the
counterpart
of
himself
but
he
evinced
great
prudence
for
he
desired
to
do
nothing
that
might
harm
his
brother
and
he
knew
too
that
all
jews
were
unpopular
thus
when
marc
in
his
impassioned
way
spoke
to
him
of
his
suspicions
declaring
that
the
real
culprit
must
certainly
be
one
of
the
brothers
of
the
christian
doctrine
david
though
at
heart
of
the
same
opinion
strove
to
calm
his
friend
saying
that
one
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
theory
of
a
prowling
tramp
a
chance
murderer
who
might
have
entered
and
left
by
the
window
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
felt
that
he
would
increase
the
popular
prejudice
against
simon
by
bringing
any
random
charge
against
the
brothers
he
foresaw
too
that
all
efforts
would
be
vain
against
the
coalition
of
the
interested
parties
unless
he
were
possessed
of
decisive
proofs
meantime
in
order
that
simon
might
benefit
by
an
element
of
doubt
would
it
not
be
best
to
revert
to
the
theory
of
that
prowler
which
everybody
had
admitted
as
possible
at
the
moment
of
the
discovery
of
the
crime
it
would
serve
as
an
excellent
basis
for
provisional
operations
whereas
a
campaign
at
that
moment
against
the
and
powerfully
supported
brothers
could
only
turn
against
the
prisoner
david
was
able
to
see
simon
in
the
presence
of
investigating
magistrate
daix
and
by
the
long
which
they
then
exchanged
they
fully
understood
that
each
was
possessed
by
the
same
feelings
later
david
also
saw
his
brother
at
the
prison
and
on
returning
to
the
lehmanns
he
described
simon
as
being
still
in
great
despair
ever
straining
his
mind
in
endeavouring
to
unravel
the
enigma
but
displaying
extraordinary
energy
in
defending
his
honour
and
that
of
his
children
when
david
recounted
all
this
seated
in
the
dim
little
shop
where
marc
also
was
present
the
latter
was
profoundly
stirred
by
the
silent
tears
of
madame
simon
who
looked
so
beautiful
and
dolorous
in
her
like
a
woman
of
weak
loving
nature
cruelly
struck
down
by
destiny
the
lehmanns
also
could
only
sigh
and
display
the
shrinking
despair
of
poor
folk
who
were
resigned
to
contumely
they
still
plied
their
needles
and
though
they
were
convinced
of
their
innocence
they
dared
not
proclaim
it
before
their
customers
for
fear
lest
they
should
aggravate
his
position
and
lose
their
own
means
of
livelihood
the
public
effervescence
at
maillebois
was
unhappily
increasing
and
one
evening
a
band
of
brawlers
smashed
the
shop
windows
it
was
necessary
to
put
up
the
shutters
at
once
then
little
manuscript
notices
were
posted
in
various
parts
of
the
town
calling
upon
patriots
to
assemble
and
burn
down
the
shop
for
some
days
indeed
particularly
one
sunday
after
a
pompous
religious
ceremony
at
the
capuchin
chapel
the
explosion
of
passion
became
so
intense
that
darras
the
mayor
had
to
send
to
beaumont
for
police
deeming
it
necessary
to
have
guards
posted
in
the
rue
du
trou
lest
the
house
of
the
lehmanns
should
be
sacked
from
hour
to
hour
the
affair
expanded
and
grew
more
virulent
becoming
a
social
battlefield
on
which
rival
parties
contended
hotly
magistrate
daix
had
doubtless
received
orders
to
conduct
his
investigations
with
all
possible
speed
in
less
than
a
month
he
interrogated
all
the
witnesses
mignot
mademoiselle
rouzaire
father
philibin
brother
fulgence
several
schoolchildren
and
railway
employés
brother
fulgence
with
his
usual
exuberance
demanded
that
his
three
assistants
brothers
isidore
lazarus
and
gorgias
should
also
be
interrogated
he
likewise
insisted
that
a
search
should
be
made
at
his
school
and
this
was
done
but
naturally
nothing
was
found
daix
thought
it
his
duty
however
to
inquire
minutely
into
the
suggestion
that
the
crime
might
have
been
committed
by
a
tramp
by
his
orders
the
entire
gendarmerie
of
the
department
scoured
the
roads
and
some
fifty
tramps
were
arrested
and
then
released
without
the
slightest
clue
being
arrived
at
in
one
instance
a
pedlar
remained
three
days
under
lock
and
key
but
to
no
purpose
then
daix
setting
aside
the
theory
of
a
prowler
remained
in
presence
of
the
the
one
tangible
piece
of
evidence
at
his
disposal
the
only
thing
on
which
he
could
rear
his
charge
when
this
reached
the
ears
of
marc
and
david
they
became
calm
again
for
it
seemed
to
them
impossible
that
a
serious
accusation
could
be
based
on
that
slip
of
paper
the
importance
of
which
was
so
open
to
discussion
as
david
repeated
although
no
guilty
tramp
had
been
found
the
hypothesis
that
one
existed
or
at
least
an
element
of
doubt
still
remained
and
if
thereto
one
added
the
lack
of
proof
against
simon
the
moral
improbability
of
his
guilt
his
protests
of
innocence
it
was
purely
impossible
for
an
investigating
magistrate
possessed
of
any
conscience
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
the
culprit
a
otherwise
a
decision
that
there
was
no
ground
to
proceed
further
against
the
prisoner
seemed
a
certainty
on
which
one
might
rely
there
came
days
however
when
marc
and
david
who
in
brotherly
fashion
began
to
lose
some
of
their
fine
assurance
bad
rumours
reached
them
the
congregations
were
bestirring
themselves
frantically
father
crabot
was
for
ever
visiting
beaumont
availing
himself
of
his
society
connections
to
dine
with
government
officials
members
of
the
judicial
and
even
the
university
world
as
the
jew
prisoner
seemed
more
and
more
likely
to
secure
release
so
on
all
sides
the
battle
grew
fiercer
at
last
then
it
occurred
to
david
to
endeavour
to
obtain
the
support
of
baron
nathan
the
great
banker
and
former
proprietor
of
la
désirade
who
was
staying
there
as
the
guest
of
his
daughter
the
countess
de
sanglebœuf
whose
marriage
portion
had
consisted
of
that
royal
domain
and
a
sum
of
ten
millions
of
francs
in
hard
cash
thus
one
bright
afternoon
in
august
david
and
marc
who
also
had
a
slight
acquaintance
with
the
baron
set
out
on
foot
for
la
désirade
a
very
pleasant
walk
for
the
distance
from
maillebois
was
not
much
more
than
a
mile
footnote
about
count
hector
de
sanglebœuf
the
last
scion
of
his
house
one
of
the
early
members
of
which
had
been
squire
to
louis
had
found
himself
completely
ruined
when
he
was
only
years
of
age
his
father
had
devoured
the
greater
part
of
the
family
fortune
and
he
himself
had
consumed
the
remnants
after
holding
a
commission
in
the
cuirassiers
he
had
resigned
it
feeling
tired
of
garrison
life
and
for
a
time
he
had
remained
living
with
a
widow
the
marchioness
de
boise
who
was
ten
years
his
senior
and
far
too
intent
on
her
own
comfort
to
marry
him
for
her
penury
added
to
his
own
would
only
have
conduced
to
a
disastrous
future
people
related
that
it
was
this
mistress
who
had
ingeniously
arranged
the
count
marriage
with
baron
nathan
daughter
lia
a
young
person
of
four
and
twenty
very
beautiful
and
all
ablaze
with
millions
nathan
had
negotiated
the
transaction
with
his
eyes
open
knowing
perfectly
well
what
he
gave
and
what
he
was
to
receive
in
exchange
adding
his
daughter
to
the
millions
which
left
his
safe
in
order
that
he
might
have
as
a
count
of
very
old
and
authentic
nobility
which
circumstance
would
open
to
him
the
portals
of
a
sphere
from
which
he
had
been
hitherto
excluded
he
himself
had
lately
acquired
the
title
of
baron
and
he
was
at
last
escaping
from
the
ancient
that
universal
contumely
of
which
the
haunting
thought
made
him
shudder
a
dealer
in
money
he
had
filled
his
cellars
with
gold
and
his
one
frantic
craving
nowadays
like
that
of
the
christian
moneymongers
whose
appetites
were
fully
as
keen
was
to
gratify
his
pride
and
his
instincts
of
domination
to
be
saluted
honoured
and
worshipped
upon
all
sides
and
in
particular
to
be
delivered
from
the
dread
of
being
kicked
and
spat
upon
like
a
mere
dirty
jew
thus
he
quite
enjoyed
staying
with
his
at
la
désirade
deriving
no
little
consideration
from
the
connections
of
his
daughter
the
countess
and
remaining
in
so
small
a
degree
a
jew
that
like
many
other
renegades
of
his
class
he
had
enrolled
himself
among
the
and
professed
the
most
fervent
royalism
and
patriotism
indeed
the
dexterous
smiling
marchioness
de
boise
who
had
derived
from
her
lover
marriage
all
the
profit
she
had
anticipated
for
him
and
for
herself
was
often
obliged
to
moderate
the
baron
ardour
that
marriage
it
should
be
mentioned
had
scarcely
changed
the
position
of
the
marchioness
and
count
hector
the
former
a
beautiful
ripening
blonde
was
doubtless
devoid
of
jealousy
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
besides
being
intelligent
enough
to
combine
such
worldly
enjoyment
as
money
may
procure
with
the
happiness
of
a
long
and
peaceful
besides
she
knew
the
beautiful
lia
to
be
an
admirable
piece
of
statuary
an
idol
full
of
narrow
egotism
who
found
it
blissful
to
be
installed
in
a
sanctuary
where
attendant
worshippers
adored
but
did
not
unduly
tire
her
she
did
not
even
read
for
reading
soon
brought
her
fatigue
she
was
quite
content
to
remain
seated
for
hours
together
in
the
midst
of
general
attentions
with
never
a
thought
for
anybody
but
herself
doubtless
she
did
not
long
remain
ignorant
of
the
real
position
of
the
marchioness
and
her
husband
but
she
dismissed
the
thought
of
it
not
wishing
to
be
worried
and
indeed
she
was
at
last
unable
to
dispense
with
that
caressing
friend
who
was
ever
in
admiration
before
her
and
who
lavished
on
her
such
loving
and
pleasing
expressions
as
pussy
beautiful
darling
dear
treasure
a
more
touching
friendship
was
never
seen
and
the
marchioness
soon
had
her
room
and
her
place
at
table
at
la
désirade
then
another
idea
of
genius
came
to
her
she
undertook
to
convert
lia
to
the
catholic
faith
the
young
wife
was
at
first
terrified
by
the
idea
for
she
feared
that
she
might
be
overwhelmed
with
religious
exercises
and
observances
but
directly
father
crabot
was
brought
into
the
affair
he
with
his
worldly
graciousness
made
the
path
quite
easy
yet
the
countess
was
most
won
over
by
the
enthusiasm
which
her
father
displayed
for
the
idea
it
was
as
if
the
baron
hoped
that
he
would
cleanse
himself
of
some
of
his
own
horrid
jewry
in
the
water
of
the
young
woman
baptism
when
the
ceremony
took
place
it
quite
upset
society
in
beaumont
and
it
was
always
spoken
of
as
a
great
triumph
of
the
church
as
a
final
achievement
the
motherly
marchioness
de
boise
who
directed
the
steps
of
hector
de
sanglebœuf
as
if
he
were
her
big
obedient
child
had
with
the
help
of
his
wife
fortune
caused
him
to
be
elected
as
one
of
the
deputies
of
beaumont
insisting
too
that
he
should
join
the
little
parliamentary
group
of
opportunist
reactionaries
who
gave
out
that
they
had
to
the
republic
for
by
this
course
she
hoped
to
raise
him
to
some
high
political
position
the
amusing
part
of
the
affair
was
that
baron
nathan
who
scarce
freed
from
the
stigma
of
his
jewish
ancestry
had
become
an
uncompromising
royalist
now
found
himself
a
far
more
fervent
partisan
of
the
monarchy
than
his
and
this
in
spite
of
the
descent
from
a
squire
of
louis
the
baron
who
had
found
an
opportunity
for
personal
triumph
in
the
baptism
of
his
daughter
on
which
occasion
he
had
chosen
her
new
name
marie
by
which
he
always
addressed
her
with
a
kind
of
pious
affectation
triumphed
also
in
the
election
of
his
as
deputy
for
he
felt
that
he
might
be
able
to
make
use
of
him
in
the
political
world
but
apart
from
questions
of
interest
he
quite
enjoyed
himself
at
la
désirade
which
was
now
full
of
priests
and
where
all
the
talk
was
about
the
various
pious
works
in
which
the
marchioness
de
boise
associated
her
friend
marie
with
whom
she
became
yet
more
intimate
and
loving
david
and
marc
slackened
their
steps
when
admitted
by
the
of
la
désirade
they
at
last
found
them
selves
in
the
grounds
it
was
a
splendid
and
enjoyable
august
day
and
the
beauty
of
the
great
trees
the
infinite
placidity
of
the
lawns
the
delightful
freshness
of
the
waters
filled
them
with
admiration
a
king
might
have
dwelt
there
at
the
end
of
the
enchanting
avenues
of
verdure
extending
on
all
sides
one
invariably
perceived
the
château
a
sumptuous
renaissance
château
rising
like
of
pinkish
stone
against
the
azure
of
the
sky
and
at
the
sight
of
that
paradise
acquired
by
jew
wealth
at
the
thought
of
the
splendid
fortune
amassed
by
nathan
the
jew
marc
instinctively
recalled
the
gloomy
little
shop
in
the
rue
du
trou
the
dismal
hovel
without
air
or
sunshine
where
lehmann
that
other
jew
had
been
plying
his
needle
for
thirty
years
and
earning
only
enough
to
provide
himself
with
bread
and
ah
how
many
other
jews
there
were
yet
more
wretched
than
he
jews
who
starved
in
filthy
dens
they
were
the
immense
majority
and
their
existence
demonstrated
all
the
idiotic
falsity
of
that
proscription
of
a
race
which
was
charged
with
the
monopolisation
of
all
wealth
when
it
numbered
so
many
poor
so
many
victims
crushed
down
by
the
almightiness
of
money
whether
it
were
jew
or
catholic
or
protestant
as
soon
as
ever
a
french
jew
became
a
great
capitalist
he
bought
a
title
of
baron
married
his
daughter
to
a
count
of
ancient
stock
made
a
pretence
of
showing
himself
more
royalist
than
the
king
and
ended
by
becoming
the
worst
of
renegades
a
fierce
who
not
only
denied
but
helped
to
slaughter
his
kith
and
kin
there
was
really
no
jew
question
at
all
there
was
only
a
capitalist
question
a
question
of
money
heaped
up
in
the
hands
of
a
certain
number
of
gluttons
and
thereby
poisoning
and
rotting
the
world
as
david
and
marc
reached
the
château
they
perceived
baron
nathan
his
daughter
and
his
seated
under
a
large
oak
tree
in
the
company
of
the
marchioness
de
boise
and
a
cleric
in
whom
they
recognised
father
crabot
doubtless
the
rector
of
the
college
of
valmarie
had
been
invited
to
a
quiet
family
lunch
in
neighbourly
fashion
for
a
distance
of
less
than
two
miles
separated
the
two
estates
and
doubtless
also
some
serious
question
had
been
discussed
at
dessert
then
to
enjoy
the
fine
weather
they
had
seated
themselves
in
some
garden
chairs
under
that
oak
and
near
a
marble
basin
into
which
ever
fell
the
crystal
of
a
source
which
an
indelicate
nymph
was
pouring
from
her
urn
on
recognising
the
visitors
who
discreetly
halted
a
short
distance
away
the
baron
came
forward
and
conducted
them
to
some
other
seats
set
out
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
basin
short
and
somewhat
bent
quite
bald
at
fifty
with
a
yellow
face
a
fleshy
nose
and
black
eyes
the
eyes
of
a
bird
of
prey
set
deeply
under
projecting
brows
nathan
had
assumed
for
the
nonce
an
expression
of
grievous
sympathy
as
if
he
were
receiving
folk
in
deep
mourning
who
had
just
lost
a
relative
it
was
plain
that
the
visit
did
not
surprise
him
he
must
have
been
expecting
it
how
i
pity
you
my
poor
david
he
said
have
often
thought
of
you
since
that
misfortune
you
know
how
highly
i
esteem
your
intelligence
enterprise
and
industry
but
what
an
affair
what
an
abominable
affair
your
brother
simon
has
put
on
your
shoulders
he
is
compromising
you
he
is
ruining
you
my
poor
david
and
with
an
impulse
of
sincere
despair
the
baron
raised
his
quivering
hands
and
added
as
if
he
feared
he
might
see
the
persecutions
of
olden
time
begin
afresh
unhappy
man
he
is
compromising
all
of
us
then
david
with
his
quiet
bravery
began
to
plead
his
brother
cause
expressing
his
absolute
conviction
of
his
innocence
enumerating
the
moral
and
material
proofs
which
in
his
estimation
were
irrefutable
while
nathan
curtly
jogged
his
head
yes
it
is
only
natural
the
baron
at
last
replied
believe
him
to
be
innocent
i
myself
still
wish
to
do
so
unfortunately
it
is
not
a
question
of
convincing
me
you
must
convince
the
officers
of
the
law
and
also
the
exasperated
masses
who
are
capable
of
doing
harm
to
all
of
us
if
he
is
not
condemned
no
i
shall
never
forgive
your
brother
for
having
saddled
us
with
such
a
dreadful
affair
then
on
david
explaining
that
he
had
come
to
him
knowing
his
influence
and
relying
on
his
help
to
make
the
truth
manifest
the
baron
became
colder
more
and
more
reserved
and
listened
in
silence
always
showed
me
so
much
kindness
monsieur
le
baron
said
david
as
you
used
to
invite
the
judicial
authorities
of
beaumont
here
i
thought
that
you
might
perhaps
be
able
to
give
me
some
information
for
instance
you
are
acquainted
with
monsieur
daix
the
investigating
magistrate
who
has
the
affair
in
hand
and
who
i
hope
will
soon
stay
further
proceedings
perhaps
you
may
have
some
news
on
that
subject
besides
which
if
a
decision
has
not
yet
been
reached
a
word
from
you
might
prove
valuable
no
nathan
protested
know
nothing
i
desire
to
know
nothing
i
have
no
official
connections
no
influence
besides
my
position
as
a
prevents
me
from
doing
anything
i
should
merely
compromise
myself
without
rendering
you
any
service
but
wait
a
moment
i
will
call
my
marc
had
remained
silent
contenting
himself
with
listening
he
had
accompanied
david
merely
to
give
him
the
support
of
his
presence
as
one
of
simon
colleagues
but
while
he
listened
he
glanced
in
the
direction
of
the
oak
tree
at
the
ladies
sitting
there
countess
marie
as
the
beautiful
lia
was
now
called
and
the
marchioness
de
boise
between
whom
father
crabot
was
reposing
in
a
rustic
armchair
while
count
hector
de
sanglebœuf
who
had
remained
erect
finished
chewing
a
cigar
the
marchioness
still
slim
and
still
pretty
under
her
fair
hair
which
she
powdered
was
expressing
great
anxiety
respecting
a
sunbeam
which
darted
on
the
nape
of
the
countess
neck
and
although
the
beautiful
jewess
indolent
and
superb
declared
that
she
was
in
no
way
inconvenienced
her
friend
lavishing
on
her
all
the
usual
pet
names
pussy
jewel
and
treasure
at
last
compelled
her
to
change
places
the
jesuit
crabot
who
was
evidently
at
his
ease
smiled
at
both
of
them
with
the
air
of
a
very
tolerant
and
meantime
a
strain
came
from
the
crystalline
water
which
the
indelicate
nymph
was
pouring
from
her
urn
into
the
marble
basin
sanglebœuf
on
being
called
by
his
came
forward
slowly
with
a
big
body
and
a
full
and
face
a
low
forehead
and
ruddy
bristling
hair
he
had
eyes
of
a
dim
blue
a
small
flabby
nose
and
a
large
voracious
mouth
by
thick
moustaches
as
soon
as
the
baron
had
told
him
of
the
help
which
david
solicited
he
became
quite
angry
though
he
affected
a
kind
of
military
mix
myself
up
in
that
affair
ah
no
he
exclaimed
must
excuse
me
monsieur
if
i
employ
my
credit
as
a
deputy
in
clearer
and
cleaner
affairs
i
am
quite
willing
to
believe
that
you
personally
are
an
honourable
man
but
you
will
really
have
a
great
deal
to
do
if
you
wish
to
defend
your
brother
besides
as
all
those
who
support
you
say
we
are
the
enemy
why
do
you
apply
to
us
then
turning
his
big
blurred
wrathful
eyes
on
marc
he
began
to
hold
forth
against
the
godless
and
unpatriotic
folk
who
dared
to
insult
the
army
too
young
to
have
fought
in
he
had
merely
served
as
a
garrison
soldier
taking
part
in
no
campaign
whatever
nevertheless
he
had
remained
a
cuirassier
to
his
very
marrow
to
cite
one
of
his
own
expressions
and
he
boasted
that
he
had
set
two
emblems
at
his
bedside
two
emblems
which
summed
up
his
religion
a
crucifix
and
a
flag
his
flag
for
which
unfortunately
for
a
good
many
people
he
had
not
died
you
have
restored
the
cross
to
the
schools
monsieur
he
continued
your
schoolmasters
decide
to
make
christians
and
not
citizens
of
their
pupils
then
and
only
then
will
you
have
any
claim
on
us
should
you
ask
us
to
render
you
a
service
david
pale
and
frigid
allowed
him
to
run
on
without
attempting
any
interruption
it
was
only
when
he
had
finished
that
he
quietly
rejoined
i
have
asked
you
for
nothing
monsieur
it
was
to
monsieur
le
baron
that
i
ventured
to
apply
nathan
fearing
a
scene
then
intervened
and
led
david
and
marc
away
as
if
to
escort
them
through
a
part
of
the
grounds
father
crabot
on
hearing
the
count
loud
voice
had
for
a
moment
raised
his
head
then
had
returned
to
his
worldly
chat
with
his
two
dear
lady
penitents
and
when
sanglebœuf
had
joined
the
others
again
one
could
distinctly
hear
them
laughing
at
the
good
lesson
which
in
their
opinion
had
just
been
administered
to
a
couple
of
dirty
jews
can
you
expect
they
are
all
like
that
said
nathan
to
david
and
marc
lowering
his
voice
when
they
were
some
thirty
paces
distant
summoned
my
in
order
that
you
might
see
for
yourselves
what
are
the
views
of
the
department
i
mean
of
the
upper
classes
the
deputies
functionaries
and
magistrates
and
so
how
could
i
be
of
any
use
to
you
nobody
would
listen
to
me
this
hypocritical
affectation
of
good
nature
in
which
one
detected
a
quiver
of
the
old
hereditary
racial
dread
must
have
seemed
cowardly
even
to
the
baron
himself
for
he
presently
added
they
are
right
i
am
with
them
france
before
everything
else
with
her
glorious
past
and
the
of
her
firm
traditions
we
can
not
hand
her
over
to
the
freemasons
and
the
cosmopolites
and
i
can
not
let
you
go
my
dear
david
without
offering
you
a
word
of
advice
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
affair
you
would
lose
everything
in
it
you
would
be
wrecked
for
ever
your
brother
will
get
out
of
the
mess
by
himself
if
he
is
innocent
those
were
his
last
words
he
shook
hands
with
them
and
quietly
walked
back
while
they
in
silence
quitted
the
grounds
but
on
the
high
road
they
exchanged
glances
almost
of
amusement
however
much
they
might
be
disappointed
for
the
scene
in
which
they
had
participated
seemed
to
them
quite
typical
perfect
of
its
kind
to
the
jews
exclaimed
marc
facetiously
the
dirty
jews
david
responded
in
the
same
jesting
way
tinged
with
bitterness
advised
me
to
forsake
my
brother
and
for
his
part
he
would
not
hesitate
he
has
thrown
his
brothers
over
plenty
of
times
already
and
he
will
do
so
again
i
certainly
must
not
knock
for
help
at
the
doors
of
my
famous
and
powerful
they
shiver
with
fear
several
more
days
now
went
by
and
however
prompt
magistrate
daix
might
have
been
with
his
investigations
he
still
delayed
his
decision
it
was
said
that
he
was
a
prey
to
increasing
perplexity
having
a
very
keen
professional
mind
and
too
much
intelligence
to
have
failed
to
divine
the
truth
but
on
the
other
hand
being
worried
by
public
opinion
and
browbeaten
at
home
by
his
terrible
wife
madame
daix
ugly
coquettish
and
very
pious
indeed
another
of
father
penitents
was
consumed
by
ambition
tortured
by
penurious
circumstances
haunted
by
dreams
of
life
in
paris
finery
and
a
social
position
as
the
outcome
of
some
great
sensational
such
an
was
within
her
reach
now
and
she
never
ceased
repeating
to
her
husband
that
it
would
be
idiotic
not
to
profit
by
the
opportunity
for
if
he
were
so
simple
as
to
release
that
dirty
jew
they
would
end
by
dying
in
a
garret
yet
daix
struggled
honest
still
but
perturbed
and
no
longer
hurrying
clinging
in
fact
to
a
last
hope
that
something
would
happen
to
enable
him
to
reconcile
his
interests
with
his
duty
this
fresh
delay
seemed
of
good
augury
to
marc
who
was
well
aware
of
the
magistrate
torments
but
who
still
remained
optimistically
convinced
that
truth
possessed
an
irresistible
power
to
which
all
ended
by
submitting
since
the
beginning
of
the
affair
he
often
went
to
beaumont
of
a
morning
to
see
his
old
friend
salvan
the
director
of
the
training
college
he
found
him
well
posted
with
information
and
derived
also
a
good
deal
of
faith
and
courage
from
what
he
said
besides
that
college
where
he
had
lived
three
years
full
of
apostolic
enthusiasm
had
remained
dear
to
him
it
stood
on
a
lonely
little
square
at
the
end
of
the
rue
de
la
république
and
when
in
those
vacation
days
he
reached
the
director
quiet
private
room
which
looked
into
a
little
garden
he
felt
himself
in
a
spot
where
peace
and
happy
confidence
prevailed
one
morning
however
when
he
called
he
found
salvan
full
of
grief
and
irritation
at
first
he
had
to
wait
in
the
for
the
director
was
engaged
with
another
visitor
but
the
latter
a
named
doutrequin
a
man
with
a
low
stubborn
brow
broad
cheeks
and
the
expression
of
a
magistrate
conscious
of
the
importance
of
his
functions
soon
quitted
the
private
room
and
marc
bowed
to
him
as
he
passed
then
his
turn
having
come
he
was
astonished
by
the
agitation
of
salvan
who
raising
his
arms
to
the
ceiling
greeted
him
with
the
exclamation
my
friend
you
know
the
abominable
news
do
you
of
medium
height
unassuming
but
energetic
with
a
good
round
face
all
gaiety
and
frankness
salvan
as
a
rule
turned
laughing
eyes
upon
those
to
whom
he
spoke
but
now
his
glance
was
ablaze
with
generous
anger
is
it
marc
inquired
anxiously
so
you
do
not
know
yet
well
my
friend
those
blackguards
have
dared
to
do
it
last
night
daix
signed
an
sending
simon
for
trial
marc
turned
pale
but
remained
silent
while
salvan
pointing
to
a
number
of
petit
which
lay
open
on
his
table
added
who
just
went
out
left
me
that
filthy
rag
which
gives
the
news
and
he
confirmed
its
accuracy
on
the
authority
of
one
of
the
clerks
at
the
palace
of
justice
whom
he
knows
then
taking
up
the
paper
crumpling
it
and
flinging
it
into
a
corner
of
the
room
with
a
gesture
of
disgust
salvan
continued
the
filthy
rag
if
iniquity
becomes
possible
it
is
because
that
paper
poisons
the
poor
and
lowly
with
its
lies
they
are
still
so
ignorant
so
credulous
so
ready
to
believe
the
stories
that
flatter
their
base
passions
and
to
think
that
paper
first
acquired
a
circulation
first
found
its
way
into
all
hands
by
belonging
to
no
party
by
remaining
neutral
by
merely
printing
serial
stories
accounts
of
current
events
and
pleasant
articles
popularising
general
knowledge
by
that
means
in
the
course
of
years
it
became
the
friend
the
oracle
the
daily
pabulum
of
the
and
the
poor
who
can
not
think
for
themselves
but
now
abusing
its
unique
position
its
immense
connection
it
places
itself
in
the
pay
of
the
parties
of
error
and
reaction
makes
money
out
of
every
piece
of
financial
roguery
and
every
underhand
political
plot
it
is
of
secondary
importance
if
lies
and
insults
come
from
the
fighting
journals
which
are
openly
reactionary
they
support
a
faction
they
are
known
and
when
one
reads
them
one
is
prepared
for
what
they
may
say
thus
croix
de
the
church
party
organ
has
started
an
abominable
campaign
against
our
friend
simon
the
jew
schoolmaster
who
poisoned
and
murdered
little
children
as
it
calls
him
but
all
that
has
scarcely
moved
me
when
however
petit
publishes
the
ignoble
and
cowardly
articles
with
which
you
are
acquainted
those
charges
and
slanders
picked
up
in
the
gutter
it
is
a
crime
to
penetrate
among
the
simple
by
affecting
bluff
good
nature
and
then
to
mingle
arsenic
with
every
dish
to
drive
the
masses
to
delirium
and
to
the
most
monstrous
actions
in
order
to
increase
one
sales
i
know
of
no
greater
crime
and
make
no
mistake
if
daix
did
not
stay
further
proceedings
it
was
because
public
opinion
weighed
on
him
poor
wretched
man
that
he
is
afraid
to
be
honest
and
afflicted
too
with
a
wife
who
rots
everything
and
public
opinion
you
know
is
such
as
it
is
made
by
petit
which
is
the
prime
mover
in
the
iniquity
for
it
sows
imbecility
and
cruelty
in
the
minds
of
the
multitude
whence
now
i
fear
we
shall
see
a
detestable
harvest
rise
salvan
sank
into
his
in
front
of
his
with
an
expression
of
despairing
anguish
on
his
countenance
and
silence
fell
while
marc
walked
slowly
to
and
fro
overwhelmed
by
that
recapitulation
of
opinions
which
he
himself
fully
shared
at
last
however
he
stopped
saying
the
same
we
must
come
to
a
decision
and
what
shall
we
do
let
us
suppose
that
this
iniquitous
trial
takes
place
simon
can
not
be
condemned
it
would
be
too
monstrous
and
surely
we
shall
not
remain
with
our
arms
folded
when
this
terrible
blow
falls
on
poor
david
he
will
want
to
act
what
do
you
advise
us
to
do
my
friend
cried
salvan
willingly
i
would
be
the
first
to
act
if
you
could
give
me
the
means
you
readily
understand
do
you
not
that
in
the
person
of
that
unfortunate
simon
it
is
the
secular
schoolmaster
whom
they
are
pursuing
and
whom
they
want
to
crush
they
regard
our
dear
training
school
as
a
nursery
of
godless
unpatriotic
men
and
they
are
eager
to
destroy
it
for
them
i
am
a
kind
of
satan
engendering
atheist
missionaries
to
ruin
whom
has
long
been
their
dream
what
a
triumph
for
the
church
gang
if
one
of
our
former
pupils
should
ascend
the
scaffold
convicted
of
an
infamous
crime
ah
my
dear
college
my
poor
house
which
i
should
like
to
see
so
useful
so
great
so
necessary
for
the
destinies
of
the
country
through
what
a
terrible
time
will
it
now
have
to
pass
all
salvan
ardent
faith
in
the
good
work
he
did
was
manifest
in
his
fervid
words
originally
a
schoolmaster
then
an
elementary
inspector
a
militant
with
a
clear
mind
devoted
to
knowledge
and
progress
he
had
given
himself
on
his
appointment
as
director
of
the
training
college
to
one
sole
mission
that
of
preparing
efficient
schoolmasters
ready
to
champion
experimental
science
and
freed
from
the
bonds
of
rome
men
who
would
at
last
teach
truth
to
the
people
and
make
it
capable
of
practising
liberty
justice
and
peace
therein
lay
the
whole
future
of
the
nation
the
future
indeed
of
all
mankind
shall
all
group
ourselves
around
you
said
marc
quivering
will
not
suffer
you
to
be
stopped
in
your
work
the
most
urgent
and
loftiest
of
all
at
the
present
time
salvan
smiled
sadly
all
my
friend
how
many
are
there
around
me
then
there
is
yourself
and
there
was
also
that
unfortunate
fellow
simon
on
whom
i
greatly
relied
again
there
is
mademoiselle
mazeline
the
schoolmistress
at
your
village
jonville
if
we
had
a
few
dozen
teachers
like
her
we
might
expect
that
the
next
generation
would
at
last
see
women
wives
and
mothers
delivered
from
the
priests
as
for
férou
wretchedness
and
revolt
are
driving
him
crazy
bitterness
of
feeling
is
poisoning
his
mind
and
after
him
comes
the
mere
flock
of
indifferent
egotistical
folk
stagnating
in
the
observance
of
routine
and
having
only
one
concern
that
of
flattering
their
superiors
in
order
to
secure
good
reports
then
too
there
are
the
renegades
those
who
have
gone
over
to
the
enemy
as
for
instance
that
mademoiselle
rouzaire
who
alone
does
the
work
of
ten
nuns
and
who
behaves
so
shamefully
in
the
simon
affair
i
was
forgetting
another
mignot
one
of
our
best
pupils
who
is
certainly
not
a
bad
fellow
but
whose
mind
requires
forming
liable
as
it
is
to
turn
out
good
or
bad
according
to
influence
salvan
was
growing
excited
and
it
was
with
increased
force
that
he
continued
a
case
that
one
may
well
despair
of
is
that
of
doutrequin
whom
you
saw
leaving
me
just
now
a
schoolmaster
himself
he
is
the
son
of
one
in
he
was
fifteen
and
three
years
later
he
entered
the
college
still
shuddering
at
the
thought
of
the
invasion
and
dreaming
of
revenge
at
that
time
considerations
of
patriotism
influenced
the
whole
of
our
educational
system
in
france
the
country
asked
us
merely
for
soldiers
the
army
was
like
a
temple
a
sanctuary
that
army
which
has
remained
waiting
with
arms
grounded
for
thirty
years
and
which
has
devoured
thousands
upon
thousands
of
millions
of
francs
and
thus
we
have
been
turned
into
a
warrior
france
instead
of
becoming
a
france
of
progress
truth
justice
and
peace
such
as
alone
could
have
helped
to
save
the
world
and
now
one
sees
patriotism
changing
doutrequin
once
a
good
republican
a
supporter
of
gambetta
and
still
quite
recently
an
into
an
even
as
it
will
end
by
changing
him
into
a
clerical
altogether
a
few
minutes
ago
he
favoured
me
with
an
extraordinary
speech
an
echo
of
the
articles
in
petit
france
before
everything
else
said
he
it
was
necessary
to
drive
out
the
jews
to
make
a
fundamental
dogma
of
respect
for
the
army
and
to
allow
more
liberty
in
education
by
which
he
meant
to
allow
the
religious
congregations
full
freedom
to
keep
the
masses
ignorant
he
typifies
the
bankruptcy
of
the
earlier
patriotic
republicans
yet
he
is
a
worthy
man
an
excellent
teacher
with
five
assistants
under
him
and
the
school
in
beaumont
two
of
his
sons
are
already
in
other
schools
of
the
department
and
i
know
that
they
share
their
father
views
and
even
exaggerate
them
as
young
men
are
wont
to
do
what
will
become
of
us
if
such
sentiments
should
continue
to
animate
our
elementary
masters
ah
it
is
high
time
to
provide
others
to
send
a
legion
of
men
of
free
intelligence
to
teach
the
people
truth
which
is
the
one
sole
source
of
equity
kindliness
and
happiness
he
spoke
these
last
words
with
such
fervour
that
marc
smiled
my
dear
master
now
i
recognise
you
he
said
are
not
going
to
give
up
the
battle
you
will
end
by
winning
it
for
you
have
truth
on
your
side
salvan
gaily
admitted
that
he
had
previously
given
way
to
a
fit
of
discouragment
the
infamous
proceedings
with
which
simon
was
threatened
had
unnerved
him
he
repeated
asked
me
for
advice
as
to
how
you
should
act
let
us
see
let
us
examine
the
situation
together
there
was
forbes
the
academy
rector
gentle
and
affable
a
very
able
man
of
letters
and
a
very
intelligent
man
also
but
he
was
deep
in
historical
studies
covertly
disdainful
of
the
present
age
and
he
acted
as
a
mere
for
the
intercourse
of
the
minister
of
public
instruction
and
the
university
staff
then
however
came
le
barazer
the
academy
inspector
and
salvan
hope
of
future
victory
was
centred
in
that
sensible
and
courageous
man
who
was
also
a
skilful
politician
the
experience
of
le
barazer
who
was
now
barely
fifty
years
of
age
dated
back
to
the
heroic
days
of
the
republic
when
the
necessity
of
secular
and
compulsory
education
had
imposed
itself
as
the
one
sole
possible
basis
of
a
free
and
just
democracy
a
worker
for
the
good
cause
from
the
very
outset
le
barazer
had
retained
all
his
hatred
of
clericalism
convinced
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
drive
the
priests
from
the
schools
and
to
free
people
minds
from
all
mendacious
superstitions
if
one
desired
that
the
nation
should
be
strong
and
capable
of
acting
in
the
plenitude
of
its
intelligence
but
age
the
obstacles
he
had
encountered
the
ever
tenacious
resistance
of
the
church
had
added
great
prudence
and
tactical
skill
to
his
republican
zeal
footnote
see
nobody
knew
better
than
he
how
to
utilise
the
little
ground
which
he
gained
each
day
and
to
oppose
inertia
to
the
assaults
of
his
adversaries
when
forcible
resistance
was
impossible
he
exerted
the
power
he
held
as
academy
inspector
without
ever
entering
into
a
direct
contest
with
anybody
either
the
prefect
or
the
deputies
or
the
senators
of
the
department
though
on
the
other
hand
he
refused
to
yield
so
long
as
his
views
were
not
adopted
it
was
thanks
to
him
that
salvan
although
violently
attacked
by
the
clerical
faction
was
able
to
continue
his
work
of
regeneration
the
renewing
of
the
of
the
elementary
schoolmasters
and
doubtless
he
alone
could
in
a
measure
defend
simon
against
his
subordinate
inspector
mauraisin
for
that
handsome
gentleman
also
had
to
be
reckoned
with
and
he
was
likely
to
prove
ferocious
a
traitor
to
the
university
cause
and
an
accomplice
of
the
congregations
since
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
church
would
prove
victorious
in
the
affair
and
pay
a
higher
reward
than
the
other
side
for
the
services
rendered
to
it
you
heard
of
his
evidence
salvan
continued
appears
that
he
said
everything
he
could
against
simon
to
daix
to
think
that
the
inspection
of
our
schools
is
confided
to
jesuits
of
his
stamp
it
is
the
same
with
that
fellow
depinvilliers
the
principal
of
the
lycée
of
beaumont
who
attends
mass
at
maxence
every
sunday
with
his
wife
and
his
two
ugly
daughters
opinions
are
free
of
course
but
if
depinvilliers
is
free
to
go
to
mass
he
ought
not
to
be
free
to
hand
one
of
our
establishments
of
secondary
education
over
to
the
jesuits
father
crabot
reigns
at
our
lycée
as
he
reigns
at
the
college
of
valmarie
ah
the
bitter
irony
of
it
when
one
thinks
that
this
secular
lycée
this
republican
lycée
which
i
sometimes
hear
called
the
rival
of
the
jesuit
college
is
in
reality
a
mere
branch
of
it
ah
our
republic
does
fine
work
it
places
its
interests
in
very
trusty
and
loyal
hands
i
can
well
understand
mauraisin
working
for
the
other
side
which
is
ever
active
and
which
pays
its
supporters
well
then
coming
to
the
point
salvan
added
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
will
see
le
barazer
do
not
go
to
him
yourself
it
is
better
that
any
application
should
come
from
me
whom
he
supports
so
bravely
and
it
is
useless
to
hustle
him
he
will
act
at
the
moment
he
thinks
fit
and
with
such
means
as
are
at
his
disposal
he
will
certainly
keep
mauraisin
quiet
if
he
can
render
simon
no
more
direct
service
but
what
i
advise
you
to
do
is
to
see
lemarrois
our
mayor
and
deputy
you
know
him
well
do
you
not
he
was
a
friend
of
berthereau
your
father
he
may
be
useful
to
you
footnote

marc
then
took
leave
and
on
reaching
the
street
decided
to
call
on
lemarrois
at
once
eleven
was
striking
and
he
would
doubtless
find
him
at
home
turning
therefore
into
the
rue
gambetta
a
thoroughfare
running
from
the
lycée
to
the
hôtel
de
ville
and
thus
cutting
beaumont
in
halves
he
made
his
way
to
the
avenue
des
jaffres
the
famous
promenade
of
the
town
which
also
traversed
it
but
from
the
préfecture
to
the
cathedral
in
that
very
avenue
in
the
midst
of
the
aristocratic
quarter
lemarrois
owned
a
luxurious
house
where
his
beautiful
wife
a
parisienne
often
gave
entertainments
wealthy
and
already
of
repute
in
his
profession
he
had
brought
her
from
paris
at
the
time
when
he
had
returned
to
his
native
place
to
practise
there
and
satisfy
his
political
ambition
while
he
was
yet
a
medical
student
he
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
gambetta
with
whom
intimacy
had
followed
for
he
showed
much
enthusiasm
and
firm
republicanism
and
became
indeed
one
of
the
great
man
favourite
disciples
thus
he
was
regarded
at
beaumont
as
a
pillar
of
the
republic
and
not
only
was
he
the
husband
of
an
amiable
wife
but
intelligent
and
he
was
personally
very
popular
with
the
poor
whom
he
attended
gratuitously
his
political
advancement
had
been
rapid
first
he
had
become
municipal
councillor
then
a
departmental
councillor
then
deputy
and
mayor
for
twelve
years
now
he
had
been
installed
in
the
latter
functions
and
was
still
the
uncontested
master
of
the
town
and
the
chief
of
the
departmental
parliamentary
contingent
though
the
latter
included
some
reactionary
deputies
directly
he
saw
marc
enter
his
study
a
spacious
room
furnished
with
chastened
luxury
he
went
towards
him
with
both
hands
outstretched
and
an
expression
of
smiling
sympathy
on
his
face
dark
with
scarcely
a
grey
hair
though
he
was
nearly
fifty
he
had
a
big
head
with
quick
bright
eyes
and
a
profile
fit
for
a
medal
my
good
fellow
i
was
astonished
not
to
see
you
and
i
can
guess
what
motive
has
brought
you
what
an
abominable
business
is
it
not
that
unfortunate
simon
is
innocent
that
is
certain
from
the
frantic
way
in
which
he
is
being
charged
i
am
on
your
side
you
know
on
your
side
with
all
my
heart
pleased
by
this
reception
cheered
at
meeting
a
just
man
marc
quickly
explained
to
him
that
he
came
to
solicit
his
influential
help
there
was
surely
something
to
be
done
one
could
not
allow
an
innocent
man
to
be
tried
and
perhaps
condemned
but
lemarrois
was
already
raising
his
arms
to
heaven
something
no
doubt
no
doubt
said
he
what
can
one
do
against
public
opinion
when
the
whole
department
is
already
stirred
up
as
you
must
know
the
political
situation
is
becoming
more
and
more
difficult
and
the
general
elections
will
take
place
next
may
that
is
in
scarcely
nine
months
time
do
you
not
understand
to
what
extreme
prudence
we
are
reduced
for
we
must
not
expose
the
republic
to
the
risk
of
a
check
he
had
seated
himself
and
his
face
became
anxious
while
toying
with
a
large
he
expressed
his
fears
about
the
agitated
condition
of
the
department
in
which
the
socialists
were
actively
bestirring
themselves
and
gaining
ground
he
did
not
fear
the
election
of
any
of
them
as
yet
for
none
could
command
a
sufficient
majority
but
if
two
reactionaries
one
of
whom
was
sanglebœuf
the
had
been
returned
at
the
last
elections
it
was
by
reason
of
a
diversion
created
by
the
socialists
each
time
that
he
pronounced
that
word
it
was
with
a
kind
of
aggressive
bitterness
in
which
one
could
detect
the
fear
and
anger
of
the
republic
which
now
possessed
power
in
presence
of
the
slow
but
irresistible
use
of
the
socialist
republic
which
wished
to
possess
it
how
can
i
help
you
my
good
fellow
he
continued
am
bound
hand
and
foot
for
we
have
to
reckon
with
public
opinion
i
do
refer
to
myself
i
am
certain
of
but
i
have
to
think
of
my
colleagues
whom
i
must
not
leave
wounded
on
the
battlefield
if
it
were
merely
a
question
of
my
own
seat
i
would
sacrifice
it
at
once
so
as
to
act
solely
in
accordance
with
my
conscience
but
the
republic
is
at
stake
and
we
must
not
allow
it
to
be
defeated
then
he
complained
of
the
prefect
of
the
department
that
handsome
hennebise
who
sported
glasses
and
arranged
his
hair
so
carefully
he
gave
no
help
whatever
for
being
perpetually
afraid
of
getting
into
difficulties
with
his
minister
or
the
jesuits
he
was
careful
to
offend
neither
he
probably
had
secret
leanings
towards
the
priests
and
the
military
set
and
it
would
be
necessary
to
watch
him
while
pursuing
however
a
course
of
diplomacy
and
compromise
similar
to
his
own
said
lemarrois
see
me
in
despair
reduced
to
measure
every
step
and
weigh
every
word
for
the
next
nine
months
under
penalty
of
being
hissed
by
the
readers
of
petit
to
the
great
delight
of
the
clerical
faction
this
simon
affair
falls
on
us
at
a
most
unfavourable
moment
if
the
elections
were
not
so
near
i
would
march
with
you
at
once
then
quite
abruptly
he
usually
so
calm
lost
his
temper
make
matters
worse
simon
not
only
saddles
us
with
this
business
at
a
difficult
moment
but
he
chooses
delbos
as
his
advocate
delbos
the
socialist
who
is
the
of
all
people
frankly
that
is
the
climax
simon
must
be
really
desirous
of
seeing
himself
condemned
marc
had
remained
listening
pained
at
heart
feeling
that
another
of
his
illusions
was
taking
flight
yet
he
knew
lemarrois
to
be
honest
and
he
had
seen
him
give
many
proofs
of
firm
republican
faith
delbos
is
very
talented
the
young
man
answered
if
poor
simon
chose
him
it
was
because
like
all
of
us
he
considered
him
to
be
the
man
of
the
situation
besides
it
is
not
certain
that
another
advocate
would
have
accepted
the
brief
it
is
a
frightful
moment
people
are
becoming
cowards
that
word
must
have
seemed
to
lemarrois
like
a
smack
he
made
a
quick
gesture
but
he
evinced
no
anger
indeed
he
began
to
smile
consider
me
very
cautious
do
you
not
my
young
friend
he
said
you
get
older
you
will
see
that
it
is
not
always
easy
in
politics
to
behave
in
accordance
with
one
own
convictions
but
why
do
you
not
apply
to
my
colleague
marcilly
your
young
deputy
the
favourite
and
the
hope
of
all
the
young
intellectuals
of
the
department
i
have
become
an
old
spent
prudent
hack
that
understood
but
marcilly
whose
mind
is
so
free
and
broad
will
certainly
place
himself
at
your
head
go
to
see
him
go
to
see
him
then
having
escorted
marc
to
the
landing
he
again
pressed
his
hands
promising
that
he
would
help
him
with
all
his
power
when
circumstances
should
permit
it
indeed
thought
marc
why
should
he
not
go
to
marcilly
the
latter
also
lived
in
the
avenue
des
jaffres
and
it
was
not
yet
noon
the
young
schoolmaster
was
entitled
to
call
on
him
as
he
had
acted
very
discreetly
as
one
of
his
electoral
canvassers
being
full
of
enthusiasm
for
a
candidate
who
was
so
sympathetic
and
possessed
of
such
high
literary
culture
born
at
jonville
marcilly
had
distinguished
himself
as
a
pupil
of
the
training
college
and
had
subsequently
held
a
professorship
at
the
faculty
of
beaumont
which
post
he
had
resigned
in
order
to
become
a
parliamentary
candidate
short
fair
and
refined
in
appearance
with
an
amiable
and
face
he
played
havoc
with
women
hearts
and
even
won
the
partiality
of
men
thanks
to
his
rare
skill
in
saying
the
right
word
to
each
and
in
evincing
all
necessary
obligingness
to
the
younger
members
of
the
electorate
he
endeared
himself
by
his
own
comparative
youth
for
he
was
only
and
by
the
happy
and
elegant
form
of
his
speeches
in
which
he
displayed
much
broadness
of
mind
and
knowledge
of
men
and
things
it
was
felt
at
the
time
of
his
election
that
one
would
at
last
have
a
really
young
deputy
on
whom
one
might
rely
he
would
renew
the
science
of
politics
infuse
into
it
the
blood
of
the
rising
generations
and
adorn
it
with
faultless
language
all
the
delightful
bloom
of
sound
literature
indeed
for
three
years
past
marcilly
had
been
acquiring
a
more
and
more
important
position
in
the
chamber
his
credit
constantly
increased
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
was
only
two
and
thirty
he
had
already
been
spoken
of
for
a
ministerial
portfolio
it
was
certain
also
that
if
he
attended
to
his
constituents
affairs
with
untiring
complaisance
he
pushed
on
his
own
still
more
successfully
profiting
by
every
circumstance
to
rise
a
little
higher
but
doing
so
in
such
a
natural
and
easy
way
that
nobody
had
yet
regarded
him
as
a
mere
one
of
those
representatives
of
hot
impatient
youth
eager
for
enjoyment
and
power
in
every
form
his
rooms
were
furnished
and
ornamented
in
a
delicate
style
and
he
received
marc
like
a
comrade
he
spoke
of
simon
too
immediately
in
a
voice
full
of
emotion
saying
how
deeply
he
was
affected
by
the
poor
man
fate
of
course
he
did
not
refuse
to
help
him
he
would
speak
in
his
favour
he
would
see
people
who
might
be
useful
but
whatever
might
be
his
graciousness
he
ended
by
recommending
extreme
prudence
on
account
of
the
proximity
of
the
elections
if
his
manners
were
more
caressing
his
answer
was
much
the
same
as
lemarrois
he
was
secretly
resolved
to
do
nothing
for
fear
of
compromising
the
republican
party
the
two
schools
might
differ
in
outward
appearance
that
of
lemarrois
being
older
and
rougher
in
its
ways
that
of
marcilly
younger
and
more
prodigal
of
compliments
but
both
were
determined
to
abandon
no
shred
of
the
power
they
held
and
now
for
the
first
time
marc
felt
that
marcilly
might
be
merely
an
in
his
flower
resolved
to
follow
his
own
course
and
bear
his
fruit
nevertheless
on
taking
leave
it
became
necessary
to
thank
him
for
with
a
flow
of
gentle
words
the
young
deputy
repeated
that
he
was
at
his
visitor
disposal
and
would
assuredly
give
some
help
marc
was
full
of
fear
and
anxiety
when
he
returned
to
maillebois
that
day
calling
on
the
lehmanns
in
the
afternoon
he
found
the
family
in
desolation
they
had
so
confidently
expected
that
further
proceedings
would
be
abandoned
david
who
was
present
quite
upset
by
the
bad
news
still
tried
to
believe
in
the
possibility
of
some
miracle
which
would
prevent
that
iniquitous
trial
from
taking
place
but
on
the
morrow
things
began
to
move
quickly
the
indictment
chamber
seemed
to
be
in
a
singular
hurry
for
the
case
was
set
down
for
hearing
at
the
earliest
assizes
those
of
october
in
presence
of
the
inevitable
david
with
his
ardent
faith
in
his
brother
innocence
recovered
all
his
courage
all
that
strength
and
firmness
of
mind
which
were
to
make
him
a
hero
the
trial
would
have
to
take
place
it
could
not
be
avoided
but
where
was
the
jury
that
would
dare
to
convict
simon
when
no
proofs
were
forthcoming
the
prisoner
never
varied
in
his
cry
of
innocence
and
the
calmness
with
which
he
waited
the
confidence
in
speedy
release
which
he
expressed
to
his
brother
at
each
visit
greatly
fortified
the
latter
at
the
lehmanns
house
as
the
expectations
of
acquittal
grew
stronger
plans
were
formed
and
madame
simon
talked
of
a
month
rest
which
she
her
husband
and
the
children
would
afterwards
take
in
provence
where
they
had
some
friends
it
was
in
the
midst
of
this
fresh
spell
of
hopefulness
that
david
one
morning
asked
marc
to
go
with
him
to
beaumont
in
order
that
they
might
discuss
the
affair
with
delbos
simon
counsel
the
young
advocate
resided
in
the
rue
fontanier
in
the
popular
trading
quarter
of
the
town
the
son
of
a
peasant
of
the
environs
he
had
studied
law
in
paris
where
for
a
short
time
he
had
frequented
many
young
men
of
socialist
views
but
hitherto
for
lack
of
one
of
those
great
causes
which
class
a
man
he
had
not
bound
himself
to
any
party
in
accepting
a
brief
in
simon
case
that
case
which
made
his
colleagues
of
the
bar
tremble
he
had
decided
his
future
he
studied
it
and
became
impassioned
on
finding
himself
in
presence
of
all
the
public
powers
all
the
forces
of
reaction
which
in
order
to
save
the
old
rotten
framework
of
society
from
destruction
were
coalescing
and
striving
to
ruin
a
poor
and
guiltless
man
and
the
rise
of
militant
socialism
was
at
the
end
of
it
all
the
salvation
of
the
country
by
the
new
force
of
which
the
freed
masses
now
disposed
footnote
a
tribunal
discharging
the
duties
of
a
grand
so
there
is
to
be
a
battle
delbos
exclaimed
gaily
when
he
received
his
visitors
in
his
little
study
littered
with
books
and
papers
i
can
not
tell
if
we
shall
conquer
but
at
all
events
we
shall
do
the
others
some
harm
short
dark
and
wiry
with
eyes
of
fire
and
tongue
of
flame
he
possessed
an
admirable
voice
and
an
extraordinary
gift
of
eloquence
at
once
enthusiastic
logical
and
precise
david
however
was
struck
by
his
apparent
doubt
of
victory
and
repeated
what
he
had
been
saying
for
a
week
past
oh
we
shall
certainly
do
so
where
can
a
jury
be
found
that
would
dare
to
convict
my
brother
without
proofs
delbos
looked
at
him
and
then
began
to
laugh
saying
us
go
down
into
the
street
my
poor
friend
and
the
first
twelve
citizens
we
get
together
will
spit
in
your
face
and
call
you
a
dirty
jew
you
read
petit
and
you
are
ignorant
of
the
beautiful
souls
and
minds
of
your
contemporaries
but
all
allusions
would
be
dangerous
and
culpable
is
that
not
so
monsieur
froment
then
as
marc
spoke
of
the
disappointment
he
had
experienced
when
visiting
influential
persons
delbos
wishing
to
free
his
brother
of
his
erroneous
views
insisted
on
the
subject
no
doubt
they
had
a
friend
in
salvan
but
he
was
sorely
threatened
and
instead
of
defending
others
needed
to
be
defended
himself
then
le
barazer
would
sacrifice
something
to
the
fire
suffering
simon
to
go
to
his
fate
and
reserving
all
his
authority
and
influence
for
the
defence
of
secular
education
next
lemarrois
the
once
incorruptible
republican
was
unknowingly
on
that
path
of
disquietude
which
leads
straight
to
reaction
then
came
marcilly
at
the
mention
of
whose
name
delbos
was
all
afire
no
trust
whatever
was
to
be
placed
in
him
he
had
always
lied
and
he
would
become
a
renegade
and
a
traitor
indeed
one
would
obtain
only
fair
words
from
all
those
folks
nothing
in
the
way
of
deeds
was
to
be
expected
neither
an
act
of
frankness
nor
one
of
courage
having
thus
judged
the
university
men
and
the
politicians
delbos
passed
to
the
judicial
world
he
was
convinced
that
magistrate
daix
had
suspected
the
truth
but
had
set
it
on
one
side
terrified
as
he
was
by
the
perpetual
quarrels
which
his
wife
stirred
up
in
order
to
prevent
him
from
releasing
the
dirty
jew
and
in
acting
as
he
had
done
he
had
surely
experienced
great
perturbation
of
conscience
for
at
bottom
he
was
honest
but
apart
from
him
one
had
to
fear
the
procureur
de
la
république
the
frisky
raoul
de
la
bissonnière
whose
speech
to
the
jury
would
certainly
prove
ferocious
vain
of
his
petty
it
seemed
to
la
bissonnière
great
condescension
on
his
part
to
serve
the
republic
and
he
meant
to
be
rewarded
for
doing
so
by
rapid
advancement
which
he
hastened
as
best
he
could
fawning
on
both
the
government
and
the
congregations
zealous
too
as
a
patriot
and
an
as
for
president
gragnon
in
him
one
would
have
a
jovial
judge
a
hard
drinker
a
keen
sportsman
fond
of
petticoats
addicted
to
witticisms
affecting
brusqueness
not
certainly
sceptical
without
soul
or
faith
and
at
the
mercy
of
the
stronger
side
finally
there
would
be
the
jury
the
composition
of
which
it
was
easy
to
foresee
one
might
expect
a
few
representatives
of
the
manufacturing
and
trading
classes
some
professional
men
clerks
and
retired
officers
and
all
would
have
poisoned
minds
all
would
tremble
for
their
skins
and
yield
to
the
general
dementia
you
see
delbos
concluded
bitterly
brother
forsaken
by
everybody
since
he
so
awkwardly
requires
help
when
fear
respecting
the
result
of
the
elections
paralyses
even
the
friends
of
truth
and
justice
will
have
a
fine
collection
of
stupidity
egotism
and
cowardice
to
judge
him
and
as
david
preserved
dolorous
silence
he
added
we
shall
not
allow
ourselves
to
be
devoured
without
raising
an
outcry
but
i
prefer
to
show
you
things
as
they
are
and
now
let
us
examine
the
position
with
respect
to
the
case
itself
he
could
tell
what
views
would
be
set
forth
by
the
prosecution
pressure
had
been
brought
to
bear
on
the
witnesses
from
all
sides
quite
apart
from
public
opinion
in
the
midst
of
whose
vitiated
atmosphere
they
lived
they
were
certainly
being
worked
upon
by
occult
powers
caught
in
a
skilfully
contrived
skein
of
daily
exhortations
which
dictated
to
them
the
statements
they
were
to
make
mademoiselle
rouzaire
now
declared
peremptorily
that
she
had
heard
simon
come
home
at
a
quarter
to
eleven
on
the
night
of
the
crime
even
mignot
now
fancied
that
he
had
heard
footsteps
and
voices
about
the
same
hour
then
influence
must
have
been
exercised
on
simon
pupils
the
bongard
doloir
savin
and
milhomme
children
with
the
object
of
extracting
from
them
statements
unfavourable
to
the
prisoner
little
sébastien
milhomme
for
instance
had
now
declared
while
sobbing
distressfully
that
he
had
never
seen
his
cousin
victor
with
any
coming
from
the
brothers
school
and
apropos
of
that
affair
people
spoke
of
an
unexpected
visit
that
madame
edouard
milhomme
had
lately
received
from
a
distant
cousin
general
jarousse
who
commanded
the
division
garrisoned
at
beaumont
he
had
never
previously
confessed
his
relationship
to
the
lady
stationer
but
had
suddenly
remembered
it
and
paid
her
that
friendly
call
moreover
the
prosecution
insisted
on
the
failure
of
all
efforts
to
find
any
tramp
who
might
have
committed
the
crime
as
had
been
originally
suspected
it
also
asserted
that
it
had
vainly
sought
any
witness
guard
or
wayfarer
who
had
seen
simon
returning
from
beaumont
to
maillebois
on
foot
on
the
other
hand
it
had
failed
to
establish
that
he
had
returned
by
train
for
no
railway
employé
remembered
having
seen
him
besides
which
several
return
tickets
had
not
been
given
up
on
the
night
of
the
crime
but
it
seemed
that
the
evidence
of
brother
fulgence
and
father
philibin
would
be
very
grave
particularly
that
of
the
latter
who
would
prove
that
the
connected
with
the
crime
had
really
belonged
to
simon
school
and
to
make
things
complete
two
handwriting
experts
of
the
prosecution
masters
badoche
and
trabut
had
declared
that
they
fully
recognised
simon
initials
an
e
and
an
s
intertwined
in
the
faint
and
virtually
illegible
paraph
on
the
slip
thus
one
could
divine
the
form
which
the
of
accusation
or
indictment
would
take
it
would
set
forth
that
simon
lied
and
that
he
had
assuredly
returned
from
beaumont
by
train
and
must
have
reached
his
home
at
the
very
time
when
mademoiselle
rouzaire
declared
that
she
had
heard
him
on
the
other
hand
it
seemed
certain
that
little
zéphirin
after
returning
from
the
capuchin
chapel
at
ten
had
not
gone
to
bed
immediately
but
had
amused
himself
by
arranging
some
religious
pictures
on
his
table
in
such
wise
that
one
might
say
the
crime
had
been
committed
between
a
quarter
to
eleven
and
eleven
it
was
easy
to
picture
the
scene
simon
seeing
a
light
had
entered
his
nephew
room
and
found
him
there
about
to
get
into
bed
arriving
from
a
banquet
heated
by
wine
he
had
yielded
to
a
fit
of
abominable
madness
moreover
he
hated
the
child
he
was
infuriated
by
the
fact
that
he
was
a
catholic
and
thus
it
was
allowable
to
hint
at
the
possibility
of
ritual
crime
at
the
horrible
legend
fixed
in
the
minds
of
the
masses
but
at
all
events
there
certainly
had
been
abomination
and
the
maddened
criminal
after
thrusting
the
first
thing
he
had
at
hand
into
the
victim
mouth
in
order
to
stifle
his
cries
had
lost
his
head
and
frantic
with
terror
had
strangled
the
lad
when
the
improvised
gag
fell
out
and
the
cries
began
afresh
more
terrible
than
ever
it
was
not
so
easy
to
explain
how
it
happened
that
the
number
of
petit
and
the
had
been
mingled
together
doubtless
the
newspaper
had
been
in
simon
pocket
for
the
boy
would
not
have
had
one
in
his
possession
as
for
the
the
prosecution
after
hesitating
slightly
had
adopted
the
view
that
this
also
must
have
been
in
simon
pocket
for
the
report
of
the
handwriting
experts
identifying
the
initials
showed
that
it
belonged
to
him
the
crime
accomplished
the
rest
was
easily
explained
simon
left
the
body
on
the
floor
touched
nothing
in
the
room
but
contented
himself
with
opening
the
window
widely
in
order
to
make
it
appear
that
the
murderer
had
come
from
outside
in
one
respect
he
had
blundered
badly
he
had
not
thought
of
picking
up
and
destroying
the
newspaper
and
the
which
had
rolled
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
this
showed
how
great
had
been
his
perturbation
and
doubtless
he
had
not
immediately
joined
his
wife
as
she
fixed
the
hour
of
his
return
at
twenty
minutes
to
twelve
in
all
probability
he
had
spent
some
time
seated
on
the
stairs
trying
to
recover
his
calmness
the
prosecution
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
charge
madame
simon
with
complicity
nevertheless
it
gave
out
that
she
did
not
tell
the
truth
when
she
spoke
of
the
smiling
quietude
the
gay
affection
displayed
by
her
husband
that
night
and
a
proof
of
her
disregard
for
veracity
was
to
be
found
in
the
evidence
of
mignot
who
was
astonished
that
his
principal
should
have
risen
so
late
the
next
morning
and
who
asserted
that
he
had
found
him
pale
and
shivering
scarce
able
to
walk
when
he
went
to
tell
him
the
dreadful
tidings
mademoiselle
rouzaire
brother
fulgence
and
father
philibin
agreed
that
simon
had
almost
fainted
at
the
sight
of
the
little
body
although
in
other
respects
he
showed
the
most
revolting
dryness
of
heart
and
in
this
again
was
there
not
an
overwhelming
proof
of
culpability
the
wretched
man
guilt
could
be
doubted
by
none
having
thus
explained
the
views
of
the
prosecution
delbos
resumed
moral
impossibilities
are
gross
no
man
of
good
sense
will
think
simon
guilty
and
besides
there
are
several
material
improbabilities
but
this
frightful
tale
is
sufficiently
well
constructed
to
seize
hold
of
the
masses
and
to
become
one
of
those
legendary
fables
which
acquire
the
force
of
truth
our
weakness
proceeds
from
the
fact
that
not
knowing
the
real
story
we
can
not
set
it
up
in
opposition
to
the
legend
now
being
forged
the
theory
of
a
night
prowler
to
which
you
seem
to
cling
can
only
serve
to
cast
a
little
doubt
into
the
minds
of
the
jury
for
there
are
serious
objections
to
it
and
so
whom
can
we
accuse
and
what
shall
my
system
of
defence
be
at
this
marc
hitherto
very
attentive
and
silent
could
not
restrain
himself
from
giving
expression
to
the
conviction
which
had
slowly
gathered
in
his
mind
there
is
no
doubt
at
all
for
me
the
criminal
was
one
of
the
brothers
delbos
well
pleased
with
the
answer
and
signifying
his
approval
by
an
energetic
gesture
then
exclaimed
so
my
own
conviction
is
the
same
the
more
i
study
the
case
the
more
i
am
led
to
that
conclusion
as
being
the
only
one
possible
and
as
david
anxiously
shook
his
head
he
added
i
know
it
seems
to
you
that
your
brother
position
would
be
very
dangerous
if
one
of
those
ignorantines
were
accused
without
decisive
proof
and
you
are
certainly
right
nevertheless
i
have
to
plead
and
the
best
way
to
prove
your
brother
innocence
is
to
demonstrate
who
the
guilty
man
must
be
is
it
not
so
you
will
tell
me
that
the
question
becomes
one
of
ascertaining
who
that
man
is
and
for
that
very
reason
i
wish
to
go
into
the
matter
with
you
thoroughly
the
discussion
continued
and
marc
recapitulated
the
reasons
which
made
him
believe
the
murderer
to
be
one
of
the
brothers
first
the
had
come
from
this
school
that
was
virtually
proved
by
what
had
occurred
at
the
milhommes
then
there
was
the
initialling
of
the
slip
and
the
corner
of
it
which
had
been
torn
away
in
which
clue
the
solution
of
the
enigma
probably
lurked
a
decisive
moral
proof
was
the
extraordinary
zeal
the
congregations
displayed
in
denouncing
simon
they
would
not
have
stirred
up
heaven
and
earth
in
this
fashion
if
they
had
not
found
it
necessary
to
save
some
black
sheep
though
of
course
they
also
hoped
to
crush
the
secular
schools
and
to
insure
the
triumph
of
the
church
moreover
there
were
features
in
the
crime
which
suggested
that
it
could
only
have
been
perpetrated
by
some
sly
cruel
bestial
but
unfortunately
arguments
did
not
suffice
and
marc
was
in
despair
that
his
investigations
had
been
thwarted
by
a
combination
of
obscurity
confusion
and
dread
which
artful
invisible
hands
seemed
to
increase
each
day
interrupted
delbos
suspect
neither
brother
fulgence
nor
father
philibin
eh
no
marc
answered
saw
them
near
the
body
when
the
crime
was
discovered
brother
fulgence
certainly
returned
to
his
school
on
quitting
the
capuchin
chapel
on
the
thursday
evening
besides
though
he
is
vain
and
crazy
i
do
not
think
him
capable
of
such
a
dreadful
deed
as
for
father
philibin
he
did
not
quit
valmerie
that
evening
moreover
he
also
seems
to
me
honest
a
worthy
man
at
bottom
silence
fell
then
marc
with
a
dreamy
expression
in
his
eyes
resumed
something
had
certainly
happened
that
morning
just
as
i
arrived
at
the
school
father
philibin
had
picked
up
the
newspaper
and
the
and
i
now
ask
myself
whether
he
profited
by
that
brief
opportunity
to
tear
off
and
do
away
with
that
corner
of
the
slip
on
which
perhaps
there
may
have
been
some
indication
but
but
mignot
though
he
hesitated
at
first
now
declares
the
corner
must
have
been
missing
when
he
first
saw
the
slip
what
about
the
assistant
brothers
isidore
lazarus
and
gorgias
asked
delbos
david
who
on
his
side
had
prosecuted
unremitting
inquiries
with
admirable
zeal
intelligence
and
patience
shook
his
head
three
have
which
a
dozen
of
their
set
will
establish
in
court
he
replied
and
lazarus
it
seems
returned
to
the
school
from
the
capuchin
chapel
with
their
principal
brother
fulgence
brother
gorgias
for
his
part
saw
a
child
home
but
he
also
had
returned
to
the
school
by
ten
according
to
all
the
members
of
the
staff
and
various
lay
witnesses
friends
of
the
brothers
it
is
true
who
perceived
him
going
in
again
did
marc
intervene
in
his
pensive
manner
his
eyes
wandering
afar
like
those
of
a
man
in
quest
of
truth
brother
gorgias
is
not
to
my
liking
i
thought
of
him
he
said
child
he
escorted
home
was
polydor
the
nephew
of
a
woman
named
pélagie
who
is
cook
to
my
wife
relatives
i
tried
to
question
the
boy
but
he
is
sly
idle
addicted
to
falsehoods
and
i
got
nothing
out
of
him
except
a
little
more
confusion
all
the
same
brother
gorgias
haunts
me
he
is
said
to
be
brutal
sensual
cynical
displaying
excessive
piety
professing
a
stern
uncompromising
exterminating
creed
i
have
been
told
also
that
he
formerly
had
some
connection
with
father
philibin
and
even
with
father
crabot
brother
gorgias
yes
i
certainly
thought
for
a
moment
that
he
might
be
our
man
but
then
i
found
i
had
nothing
to
go
upon
except
suppositions
brother
gorgias
is
not
a
pleasant
customer
declared
david
my
feelings
are
akin
to
yours
but
can
we
denounce
him
when
we
have
only
arguments
to
bring
against
him
no
witness
would
support
us
all
would
stand
up
for
the
brother
and
whitewash
him
in
reply
to
our
impious
charges
delbos
had
listened
attentively
all
events
said
he
can
not
defend
simon
without
carrying
the
battle
into
the
enemy
camp
bear
in
mind
too
that
the
only
help
from
which
you
may
derive
some
advantage
will
perhaps
come
to
you
from
the
church
itself
the
old
quarrel
between
our
bishop
monseigneur
bergerot
and
father
crabot
the
rector
of
valmarie
is
taking
a
very
serious
turn
by
reason
precisely
of
the
simon
affair
my
own
belief
is
that
the
crafty
mind
and
the
invisible
hand
which
seem
to
you
to
be
directing
the
whole
business
are
those
of
father
crabot
i
certainly
do
not
accuse
him
of
the
crime
but
it
is
he
who
is
protecting
the
culprit
and
if
we
attack
him
we
shall
strike
the
head
of
the
band
besides
which
the
bishop
will
be
on
our
side
not
openly
of
course
but
is
not
such
assistance
something
even
if
it
be
secret
a
smile
of
doubt
appeared
on
marc
face
as
if
he
felt
that
one
never
had
the
church
on
one
side
when
human
truth
and
justice
were
at
stake
however
he
likewise
regarded
father
crabot
as
the
enemy
and
to
trace
the
developments
of
the
case
back
to
him
and
to
endeavour
to
destroy
him
was
the
right
course
so
they
spoke
of
father
crabot
and
of
his
past
life
which
a
somewhat
mysterious
legend
poetised
he
was
thought
to
be
the
illegitimate
grandson
of
a
famous
general
a
prince
of
the
first
empire
which
relationship
in
the
estimation
of
patriotic
souls
endued
his
pious
ministry
with
some
of
the
resounding
glory
of
battle
and
conquest
but
the
romantic
circumstances
in
which
he
had
taken
orders
touched
people
more
deeply
at
thirty
years
of
age
he
had
been
a
rich
handsome
gallant
cavalier
on
the
point
of
marrying
a
beautiful
widow
a
duchess
with
a
great
name
and
a
great
fortune
but
brutal
death
had
struck
her
down
in
her
flower
that
blow
as
father
crabot
often
said
had
shown
him
the
bitter
nothingness
of
human
joys
and
cast
him
into
the
arms
of
religion
he
had
gained
thereby
the
tremulous
tenderness
of
all
women
hearts
they
were
well
pleased
indeed
that
he
should
have
sought
a
refuge
in
heaven
for
love
of
the
one
woman
whom
he
had
adored
then
another
legend
that
of
the
foundation
of
the
college
of
valmarie
endeared
him
to
the
devotees
of
the
region
the
valmarie
estate
had
previously
belonged
to
the
old
countess
de
quédeville
who
after
notorious
amours
had
retired
thither
to
sanctify
her
last
years
by
the
practice
of
extreme
piety
her
son
and
having
perished
in
an
accident
while
travelling
she
remained
alone
with
her
grandson
and
sole
heir
gaston
a
boy
of
nine
years
who
was
most
aggressively
turbulent
violent
in
speech
and
wild
in
his
play
not
knowing
how
to
subdue
him
and
not
daring
to
trust
him
to
school
life
the
countess
had
engaged
as
tutor
a
young
jesuit
of
six
and
twenty
father
philibin
whose
manners
suggested
his
peasant
origin
but
who
was
recommended
to
her
for
his
extreme
firmness
he
no
doubt
made
the
countess
acquainted
with
father
crabot
who
was
some
five
or
six
years
his
senior
and
who
was
then
at
the
height
of
his
celebrity
radiant
with
the
halo
of
his
great
passion
and
its
tragic
divine
ending
six
months
later
as
friend
and
confessor
he
reigned
at
valmarie
people
asserting
that
he
was
the
lover
of
the
countess
as
that
turbulent
boy
gaston
seemed
to
disturb
the
happy
quietude
of
the
domain
a
truly
royal
one
with
its
grand
old
trees
its
running
waters
its
great
stretches
of
green
velvet
there
was
at
one
moment
some
thought
of
sending
him
to
the
jesuit
fathers
in
paris
he
climbed
the
loftiest
poplars
for
rooks
nests
took
to
the
river
in
his
clothes
to
fish
for
eels
came
home
in
rags
with
arms
and
legs
bruised
and
his
face
bleeding
giving
his
grandmother
no
rest
whatever
from
anxiety
in
spite
of
father
philibin
reputed
firmness
but
all
at
once
the
situation
was
tragically
altered
gaston
was
drowned
one
day
while
walking
out
under
the
nominal
supervision
of
his
tutor
the
latter
related
that
the
boy
had
fallen
into
a
dangerous
hole
full
of
water
whence
it
had
been
impossible
to
extricate
him
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
a
young
fellow
of
fifteen
georges
plumet
the
son
of
one
of
the
gardeners
and
sometimes
gaston
companion
in
his
escapades
who
had
run
up
on
seeing
the
accident
from
a
distance
the
countess
profoundly
grieved
died
during
the
following
year
bequeathing
valmarie
and
all
her
fortune
to
father
crabot
or
to
be
exact
to
a
petty
clerical
banker
of
beaumont
who
lent
his
name
in
such
matters
with
directions
to
establish
a
jesuit
college
on
the
estate
crabot
for
a
time
had
taken
himself
elsewhere
then
had
returned
with
the
rank
of
rector
and
for
ten
years
now
the
college
had
been
prospering
under
his
control
he
reigned
there
from
his
austere
and
retired
little
cell
whose
walls
were
bare
and
whose
furniture
was
limited
to
a
little
pallet
a
table
and
two
chairs
he
made
the
bed
he
swept
the
floor
himself
and
though
he
heard
the
confessions
of
his
female
penitents
in
the
chapel
it
was
in
that
cell
that
he
listened
to
those
of
the
men
as
if
he
were
proud
of
the
poverty
and
solitude
into
which
he
withdrew
like
some
redoubtable
divinity
leaving
to
father
philibin
the
prefect
of
the
studies
all
usual
daily
intercourse
with
the
pupils
of
the
establishment
but
although
he
rarely
showed
himself
to
them
in
the
he
reserved
to
himself
lavished
attentions
on
his
pupils
relations
particularly
on
the
ladies
and
young
girls
of
the
local
aristocracy
busying
himself
with
the
future
of
his
dear
sons
and
dear
daughters
arranging
their
marriages
insuring
them
good
positions
in
fact
disposing
of
all
those
fine
folk
for
the
greater
glory
of
god
and
of
his
particular
order
and
it
was
thus
that
he
had
become
an
personage
tell
the
truth
delbos
resumed
crabot
strikes
me
as
being
a
mediocrity
whose
entire
strength
proceeds
from
the
stupidity
of
those
among
whom
he
works
i
am
more
distrustful
of
father
philibin
whom
you
think
a
worthy
man
i
am
impressed
by
his
affected
roughness
and
frankness
suspicion
clings
to
his
doings
and
to
crabot
in
the
time
of
the
countess
de
quédeville
such
as
the
drowning
of
that
child
gaston
and
all
the
more
or
less
lawful
manœuvring
to
acquire
the
estate
and
the
fortune
it
happens
that
the
only
witness
of
death
georges
plumet
the
gardener
son
is
precisely
brother
gorgias
for
whom
philibin
assumed
great
affection
and
of
whom
he
made
an
ignorantine
when
of
course
he
changed
his
name
and
now
we
find
those
three
men
together
again
and
the
solution
of
the
present
mystery
is
to
be
found
perhaps
in
that
circumstance
for
if
brother
gorgias
be
guilty
the
efforts
of
the
others
to
save
him
might
be
explained
by
strong
personal
motives
the
existence
of
some
skeleton
in
their
cupboard
and
the
dread
lest
he
should
speak
out
if
he
were
abandoned
unfortunately
as
you
said
just
now
we
can
only
form
suppositions
whereas
we
need
substantial
authentic
facts
however
let
us
keep
on
searching
defence
i
repeat
it
will
only
be
possible
if
i
am
armed
sufficiently
to
be
an
accuser
and
an
avenger
that
conversation
with
delbos
inspirited
david
and
marc
and
even
as
had
been
foreseen
they
tasted
for
a
moment
the
pleasure
of
witnessing
a
quarrel
in
the
clerical
camp
at
the
outset
of
the
affair
abbé
quandieu
the
parish
priest
of
maillebois
had
not
concealed
his
belief
in
the
innocence
of
simon
he
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
accuse
one
of
the
brothers
but
he
allowed
it
to
be
seen
that
he
disapproved
of
the
frantic
campaign
which
the
brothers
and
the
capuchins
were
carrying
on
with
the
object
of
gaining
the
whole
district
for
themselves
for
apart
from
his
own
loss
of
parishioners
it
distressed
him
for
religion
sake
to
see
the
basest
superstitions
triumphing
when
he
found
public
opinion
suddenly
poisoned
with
respect
to
simon
case
he
became
neutral
never
speaking
of
the
affair
but
dreading
in
his
sincere
piety
lest
his
dear
gentle
lord
of
charity
and
love
should
be
slain
and
replaced
by
a
god
of
falsehood
and
iniquity
his
only
consolation
was
that
his
views
coincided
with
those
of
monseigneur
bergerot
the
bishop
who
was
fond
of
him
and
whom
he
often
visited
like
the
priest
himself
the
bishop
was
accused
of
gallicanism
which
simply
meant
that
he
did
not
invariably
bow
to
rome
and
that
the
idolatrous
worship
of
images
and
the
impudent
trafficking
of
those
who
contracted
to
perform
spurious
miracles
were
repugnant
to
his
pure
faith
for
instance
he
observed
with
saddened
eyes
the
invading
tendencies
of
the
maillebois
capuchins
who
so
openly
traded
on
the
shrine
of
antony
of
padua
which
they
had
set
up
in
their
chapel
thus
competing
disloyally
with
the
church
of
martin
where
abbé
quandieu
officiated
the
bishop
anxiety
increased
when
behind
the
capuchins
he
divined
the
presence
of
the
jesuits
all
the
disciplined
troops
of
his
enemy
father
crabot
who
was
always
employing
his
influence
to
thwart
him
and
who
dreamt
of
becoming
master
of
the
diocese
the
bishop
reproached
the
jesuits
with
compelling
god
to
go
to
men
instead
of
forcing
men
to
go
to
god
and
he
also
saw
in
them
the
artisans
of
the
society
compromise
of
the
falling
off
both
in
faith
and
in
observances
which
in
his
opinion
was
destroying
the
church
in
the
simon
affair
on
finding
them
so
intent
upon
ruining
the
unhappy
prisoner
he
became
suspicious
and
studied
the
case
very
carefully
with
abbé
quandieu
who
was
well
informed
he
must
then
have
arrived
at
a
decisive
opinion
perhaps
indeed
he
learnt
who
was
really
the
culprit
but
what
course
could
he
take
how
could
he
give
up
a
member
of
the
religious
orders
without
risk
of
doing
harm
to
religion
he
lacked
the
courage
to
go
as
far
as
that
yet
certainly
his
silence
was
full
of
bitterness
and
he
felt
anxious
as
to
the
consequences
of
the
monstrous
adventure
into
which
others
were
forcing
the
church
which
he
would
have
liked
to
see
all
peace
equity
and
kindliness
thus
monseigneur
bergerot
resignation
was
not
absolute
the
idea
of
abandoning
his
dear
abbé
quandieu
of
allowing
those
whom
he
called
dealers
of
the
temple
to
consummate
his
ruin
was
unbearable
to
him
on
coming
then
to
maillebois
in
the
course
of
a
pastoral
round
of
inspection
he
officiated
personally
in
the
ancient
church
of
martin
and
delivered
an
address
in
which
he
blamed
all
gross
superstition
referring
plainly
to
the
commerce
carried
on
by
the
capuchins
in
their
chapel
which
was
now
driving
as
much
trade
as
a
bazaar
nobody
was
mistaken
as
to
the
bishop
meaning
moreover
everyone
felt
that
the
blow
was
directed
not
only
against
father
théodose
but
against
father
crabot
who
was
behind
him
and
as
monseigneur
ended
by
expressing
the
hope
that
the
church
of
france
would
remain
the
pure
source
of
all
truth
and
justice
the
scandal
became
the
greater
for
in
those
words
an
allusion
to
the
simon
affair
was
detected
and
the
bishop
was
accused
of
casting
the
brothers
of
the
christian
doctrine
to
the
jews
the
and
the
traitors
on
returning
to
his
episcopal
palace
monseigneur
bergerot
must
have
trembled
at
the
thought
of
the
courage
he
had
shown
particularly
as
everything
was
done
to
embitter
his
position
still
more
some
intimates
in
recounting
the
visit
of
thanks
which
abbé
quandieu
paid
him
mentioned
that
the
bishop
and
the
poor
priest
had
wept
together
the
agitation
at
beaumont
increased
as
the
assizes
drew
near
the
indictment
chamber
having
returned
the
papers
in
simon
case
to
the
prosecution
office
the
first
hearing
had
been
fixed
for
monday
october
meantime
the
position
taken
up
by
the
bishop
brought
popular
passions
to
a
climax
he
was
attacked
even
more
violently
by
petit
than
by
croix
de
though
the
latter
journal
was
in
the
hands
of
the
jesuits
the
simonists
had
plucked
up
a
little
courage
at
the
advent
of
his
help
but
the
poisoned
public
opinion
with
fresh
romances
among
others
an
extraordinary
invention
to
the
effect
that
a
jew
syndicate
had
been
formed
to
buy
up
all
the
powers
of
the
world
by
dint
of
millions
and
three
millions
it
was
said
had
gone
to
monseigneur
bergerot
as
his
share
from
that
moment
dementia
and
violence
reigned
throughout
the
town
from
le
mauviot
the
to
the
avenue
des
jaffres
the
aristocratic
quarter
passing
by
way
of
the
rue
fontanier
and
the
adjoining
narrow
streets
where
the
smaller
shopkeepers
congregated
the
contest
became
more
and
more
bitter
the
simonists
who
were
few
in
number
being
crushed
by
the
hordes
of
their
adversaries
on
one
occasion

the
the

was
that
the

and
even
some
of
the
socialist
working
men
either
disinterested
themselves
from
the
contest
or
took
up
positions
against
right
and
truth
then
terror
reigned
cowardice
became
widespread
all
the
social
forces
coalesced
against
the
unhappy
prisoner
the
university
headed
by
forbes
its
rector
did
not
stir
for
fear
of
compromising
itself
the
official
administration
personified
by
prefect
hennebise
had
disinterested
itself
from
the
question
at
the
outset
desirous
as
it
was
of
incurring
no
worries
the
politicians
the
senators
as
well
as
the
deputies
remained
silent
for
fear
they
might
lose
their
seats
if
they
spoke
otherwise
than
the

did
the
church
in
which
the
bishop
had
ceased
to
count
father
crabot
becoming
its
real
chief
demanded
the
setting
up
of
piles
and
stakes
and
the
extermination
of
all
jews
protestants
and
freemasons
the
army
by
the
voice
of
general
jarousse
also
called
for
the
cleansing
of
the
country
and
the
enthronement
of
an
emperor
or
a
king
as
soon
as
all
the
rogues
without

or

should
be
sabred

there
remained
the
judicial
bench
towards
which
every
hope
went
forth

it
not

in
its
hands
the
necessary
the
condemnation
of
the
dirty
jew
by
which
alone
the
salvation
of
france
might
be
assured
thus
gragnon
the
presiding
judge
and
raoul
de
la
bissonnière
the
public
prosecutor
had
become
great
personages
of
whom
nobody
doubted
for
their

as
notorious
as
were
their
desire
for
advancement
and
their
passion
for
popularity
when
the
names
inscribed
on
the
general
roll
of
jurors
for
the
coming
assizes
were
made
public
there
was
a
fresh
outburst
of
violence
and
intrigue
the
most
terrible
pressure
was
brought
to
bear
on
the
persons
who
were
likely
to
serve
so
that
nobody
might
remain
ignorant
of
their
names
and
addresses
petit
printed
them
thus
designating
them
to
the
fury
of
the
crowd
in
the
event
of
their
failing
to
convict
the
prisoner
they
received
anonymous
letters
they
were
upset
by
strange
visitors
they
were
begged
to
think
of
their
wives
and
children
in
the
of
the
avenue

people
amused
themselves
with
elaborate
calculations
passing
in
review
the
more
or
less
certain
opinions
of
each
individual
juror
would
such
a
one
convict
or
would
he
not
the
question
became
a
society
pastime
at
beautiful
madame
lemarrois
house
each
saturday
her
day
nothing
else
was
spoken
of
all
the
ladies
came
générale
jarousse
who
although
lean
ugly
and
dusky
was
said
to
be
abominably
unfaithful
to
the
general
her
husband
présidente
gragnon
who
still
superb
and
languishing
fascinated
the
young
assessors
of
the
public
prosecution
service
préfete
hennebise
who
like
an
artful
and
prudent
parisienne
spoke
little
and
listened
a
great
deal
together
with
the
eager
madame
daix
the
investigating
magistrate
wife
and
at
times
even
madame
de
la
bissonnière
the
prosecutor
spouse
though
she
gentle
and
retiring
in
her
ways
seldom
went
into
society
the
ladies
had
all
attended
a
great
fête
given
at
la
désirade
by
the
sanglebœufs
in
accordance
with
the
advice
of
baron
nathan
who
had
prevailed
on
his
daughter
to
shake
off
her
indolence
and
place
herself
like
others
of
her
sex
at
the
service
of
the
good
cause
the
part
which
women
played
in
the
affair
was
indeed
an
influential
one
they
were
worth
an
army
said
young
deputy
marcilly
who
waiting
to
see
on
which
side
victory
would
rest
comported
himself
as
a
simonist
with
some
and
as
an
with
others
but
a
last
quarrel
maddened
everybody
one
morning
petit
formally
suggested
that
at
least
some
part
of
the
case
should
be
heard
this
idea
had
certainly
not
originated
with
the
newspaper
itself
one
divined
in
it
a
deep
knowledge
of
the
sentiments
of
the
multitude
a
hope
that
mystery
would
make
the
charges
appear
yet
more
monstrous
than
they
were
and
a
desire
for
some
convenient
means
by
which
one
might
subsequently
justify
the
condemnation
of
an
innocent
man
as
for
instance
by
asserting
that
facts
had
come
out
with
which
the
general
public
was
not
acquainted
the
simonists
detected
the
danger
protested
appealed
for
full
light
the
hearing
of
the
whole
case
in
open
court
whereupon
the
fired
with
indignation
shrieked
that
the
appeal
was
scandalous
and
demanded
to
know
whether
the
ears
of
respectable
people
were
to
be
soiled
by
being
compelled
to
listen
to
the
most
abominable
particulars
thus
during
the
last
week
a
furious
raged
in
beaumont
at
last
the
great
day
october
arrived
the
school
term
having
begun
marc
had
been
obliged
to
reinstall
himself
at
jonville
with
geneviève
and
little
louise
whom
madame
duparque
and
madame
berthereau
had
insisted
on
keeping
with
them
throughout
the
whole
vacation
that
year
marc
had
assented
the
more
readily
as
his
sojourn
at
maillebois
permitted
him
to
carry
on
his
investigations
which
alas
led
to
nothing
but
at
the
same
time
he
had
felt
so
uncomfortable
in
the
ladies
house
where
never
a
word
was
said
of
the
great
affair
that
he
was
happy
to
find
himself
once
more
in
his
school
among
his
troop
of
playful
boys
some
of
whom
were
so
dear
to
him
on
the
other
hand
at
his
own
request
he
had
been
cited
as
a
witness
in
the
case
in
order
that
he
might
testify
to
simon
good
character
and
he
awaited
the
trial
with
a
quiver
of
emotion
again
possessed
by
tenacious
reliance
in
truth
and
justice
for
it
seemed
to
him
impossible
that
a
man
could
be
condemned
without
proofs
in
these
days
and
in
france
a
land
of
liberty
and
generosity
when
he
arrived
at
beaumont
on
the
monday
morning
the
town
appeared
to
be
in
a
state
of
siege
most
of
the
troops
were
kept
under
arms
in
their
barracks
but
gendarmes
and
infantrymen
guarded
the
approaches
of
the
palace
of
justice
and
in
order
to
reach
it
marc
had
to
overcome
all
sorts
of
obstacles
although
he
was
duly
provided
with
a
summons
again
he
found
the
staircases
and
passages
likewise
barred
by
troops
the
assize
court
a
new
and
very
spacious
hall
glittered
with
gilding
and
imitation
marble
in
the
crude
light
entering
by
six
large
windows
the
place
was
already
crowded
two
hours
before
the
opening
of
the
proceedings
all
the
fine
folk
of
beaumont
were
assembled
behind
the
judges
armchairs
there
were
ladies
in
full
dress
everywhere
even
on
the
benches
usually
reserved
for
witnesses
and
the
where
only
standing
room
was
provided
was
already
tumultuous
a
picked
throng
was
gathered
there
one
recognised
the
church
beadles
and
the
hired
of
the
streets
with
whom
mingled
some
of
the
ranters
of
the
young
catholic
set
there
was
a
long
delay
and
thus
marc
had
ample
time
to
examine
the
faces
around
him
and
to
realise
amid
what
hostile
passions
the
proceedings
would
take
their
course
the
court
appeared
first
gragnon
and
his
assessors
then
the
procureur
de
la
république
la
bissonnière
the
first
formalities
were
accomplished
rapidly
but
it
was
rumoured
that
a
had
not
been
formed
without
difficulty
several
jurors
on
the
roll
having
applied
to
be
excused
so
great
was
their
dread
of
incurring
any
responsibility
in
simon
case
at
last
the
twelve
chosen
men
entered
the
court
in
a
file
and
took
their
seats
morosely
like
condemned
criminals
there
were
five
shopkeepers
two
manufacturers
two
individuals
living
on
their
means
a
doctor
an
architect
and
a
retired
army
captain
the
architect
a
pious
man
named
jacquin
who
worked
for
the
bishopric
happened
to
be
the
foreman
his
name
having
come
first
at
the
drawing
of
lots
if
the
counsel
for
the
defence
had
not
challenged
him
by
reason
of
his
connections
it
was
because
he
enjoyed
a
reputation
for
loyalty
uprightness
and
honesty
moreover
something
like
disappointment
became
manifest
among
the
on
the
arrival
of
the
jurymen
whose
names
were
repeated
here
and
there
as
each
in
succession
was
identified
some
of
them
appeared
to
be
doubtful
customers
and
there
had
been
hopes
of
a
more
reliable
jury
one
absolutely
determined
to
convict
the
prisoner
deep
silence
fell
then
the
examination
of
simon
began
looking
puny
and
awkward
as
he
entered
the
court
he
had
created
an
unfavourable
impression
but
he
had
drawn
himself
up
and
now
by
reason
of
the
quiet
and
easy
way
in
which
he
answered
the
questions
addressed
to
him
he
appeared
to
be
impudent
gragnon
the
presiding
judge
had
put
on
the
scoffing
air
which
he
assumed
on
great
occasions
while
keeping
his
little
grey
eyes
fixed
upon
the
advocate
maître
delbos
the
anarchist
as
he
called
him
whom
he
had
undertaken
to
suppress
with
a
meantime
he
indulged
in
witticisms
striving
to
provoke
laughter
but
growing
gradually
irritated
by
the
calmness
of
simon
who
as
he
did
not
lie
was
unable
to
contradict
himself
and
thus
give
himself
away
the
judge
therefore
became
insolent
vainly
endeavouring
to
provoke
a
protest
from
delbos
but
the
latter
knowing
his
man
held
his
tongue
and
smiled
on
the
whole
the
first
day
proceedings
while
rejoicing
the
simonists
rendered
the
extremely
anxious
for
the
prisoner
had
clearly
set
forth
the
hour
of
his
return
to
maillebois
and
the
manner
in
which
he
had
immediately
joined
his
wife
without
it
being
possible
for
the
judge
to
produce
a
single
certain
ascertained
fact
in
opposition
to
his
declarations
at
the
rising
of
the
court
when
the
crowd
retired
the
witnesses
for
the
defence
were
hooted
and
there
was
almost
a
fight
on
the
steps
of
the
palace
of
justice
on
the
tuesday
the
hearing
of
the
witnesses
began
amid
a
yet
greater
concourse
of
people
first
came
mignot
whose
statements
were
now
less
assertive
than
they
had
been
during
the
magisterial
inquiry
he
no
longer
spoke
positively
of
the
hour
at
which
he
had
heard
sounds
of
footsteps
and
voices
simple
and
worthy
fellow
as
he
was
at
bottom
he
doubtless
felt
disturbed
when
he
thought
of
the
terrible
consequences
of
such
evidence
as
the
judge
tried
to
extract
from
him
but
mademoiselle
rouzaire
was
pitilessly
precise
she
specified
the
exact
time
a
quarter
to
eleven
adding
even
that
she
had
fully
recognised
simon
voice
and
footfall
then
came
a
long
procession
of
railway
employés
officials
and
mere
wayfarers
whose
evidence
was
taken
to
solve
the
question
whether
the
prisoner
had
travelled
by
the
train
as
the
prosecution
asserted
or
whether
he
had
returned
home
on
foot
as
he
himself
claimed
to
have
done
the
depositions
on
the
subject
were
interminable
full
of
confusion
and
contradictions
the
impression
they
left
however
was
somewhat
favourable
to
the
defence
but
next
came
the
much
awaited
evidence
of
father
philibin
and
brother
fulgence
the
former
which
was
very
brief
proved
a
disappointment
for
the
jesuit
merely
recounted
in
a
few
husky
sentences
how
he
had
found
the
little
body
on
the
floor
near
the
bed
but
brother
fulgence
amused
the
whole
assembly
by
the
vehemence
he
imparted
to
his
narrative
throughout
the
whole
of
which
he
gesticulated
as
wildly
as
a
nevertheless
he
seemed
quite
pleased
with
the
effect
he
produced
from
the
very
outset
of
the
affair
he
had
not
ceased
to
muddle
and
spoil
things
at
last
the
three
assistant
brothers
isidore
lazarus
and
gorgias
who
had
been
specially
cited
by
the
defence
were
called
delbos
allowed
the
two
former
to
retire
after
a
few
insignificant
questions
but
he
rose
and
remained
erect
while
gorgias
was
at
the
bar
that
former
little
peasant
the
son
of
a
gardener
at
valmarie
georges
plumet
as
he
was
called
in
the
days
of
the
countess
de
quédeville
and
now
brother
gorgias
of
the
ignorantine
order
was
a
strong
thin
dark
and
knotty
man
with
a
low
stern
forehead
projecting
and
thick
lips
under
a
big
nose
shaped
like
an
eagle
beak
as
formerly
mentioned
he
was
afflicted
with
a
tic
a
convulsive
twitching
of
his
upper
lip
on
its
left
side
which
thus
disclosed
his
strong
teeth
and
formed
a
kind
of
involuntary
rictus
having
a
violent
and
scoffing
expression
when
he
stepped
forward
in
his
old
black
frock
and
with
his
white
band
of
doubtful
cleanliness
a
quiver
which
had
come
nobody
knew
whence
sped
through
the
assembly
and
immediately
a
duel
with
questions
as
keen
as
sword
thrusts
and
answers
as
cutting
as
parries
began
between
the
advocate
and
the
brother
on
the
subject
of
the
evening
of
the
crime
on
the
time
which
the
witness
had
taken
to
escort
little
polydor
to
his
home
and
the
precise
hour
at
which
he
had
returned
to
the
school
the
public
listened
in
perplexity
failing
to
understand
the
decisive
importance
of
this
examination
for
the
witness
was
a
stranger
to
most
of
the
people
present
as
it
happened
brother
gorgias
in
his
violent
scoffing
way
found
an
answer
for
every
question
produced
proofs
and
established
the
fact
that
at
ten
he
had
been
in
bed
in
his
cell
brothers
isidore
and
lazarus
were
recalled
the
doorkeeper
of
the
brothers
school
was
fetched
together
with
two
inhabitants
of
maillebois
belated
promenaders
and
all
swore
and
confirmed
the
ignorantine
assertions
footnote
those
who
collect
municipal
dues
at
the
gates
or
outskirts
of
french
of
course
this
duel
was
not
fought
without
considerable
intervention
on
the
part
of
president
gragnon
who
thought
the
opportunity
favourable
to
silence
delbos
on
the
ground
that
he
addressed
insulting
questions
to
the
brother
delbos
retorted
by
submitting
and
there
was
quite
a
amidst
which
brother
gorgias
seemed
triumphant
turning
on
the
advocate
sly
glances
of
disdain
as
if
to
imply
that
he
feared
nothing
whatever
protected
as
he
was
by
his
god
of
anger
and
extermination
who
proved
so
terrible
to
infidels
but
if
the
incident
yielded
no
result
that
delbos
could
immediately
put
to
use
it
wrought
great
perturbation
and
some
folk
felt
terribly
alarmed
lest
simon
should
escape
as
the
result
of
such
attempts
to
cast
doubt
into
the
minds
of
the
jurors
that
alarm
must
have
spread
to
the
congregations
for
a
fresh
incident
occurred
after
the
evidence
of
the
handwriting
experts
masters
badoche
and
trabut
who
amidst
general
stupefaction
explained
how
they
detected
simon
initials
an
e
and
an
s
interlaced
in
the
paraph
on
the
when
nobody
else
could
see
them
there
that
was
the
one
document
in
the
case
everything
depended
on
it
thus
the
evidence
of
those
extraordinary
experts
was
extremely
grave
it
meant
the
condemnation
of
simon
it
was
then
that
father
philibin
who
had
followed
the
proceedings
most
attentively
asked
the
judge
permission
to
return
to
the
bar
there
in
a
ringing
voice
he
who
had
first
shown
himself
so
spiritless
and
retiring
recounted
a
brief
story
of
a
certain
letter
he
had
seen
a
letter
written
by
simon
to
a
friend
and
signed
with
the
same
flourishes
and
when
gragnon
pressed
him
asked
for
precise
particulars
the
jesuit
raised
his
hand
towards
the
picture
of
the
crucifixion
above
the
judgment
seat
and
declared
theatrically
that
it
was
a
secret
of
the
confessional
and
that
he
would
say
no
more
thus
the
second
day
proceedings
came
to
an
end
amid
a
paroxysm
of
feverishness
and
tumult
on
the
wednesday
the
question
of
hearing
the
report
on
the
examination
and
the
evidence
of
the
school
children
was
dealt
with
the
presiding
judge
had
the
right
to
take
such
a
course
but
delbos
without
contesting
it
set
forth
all
the
danger
of
wrapping
the
affair
in
mystery
and
submitted
fresh
to
the
effect
that
all
evidence
should
be
heard
in
open
court
none
the
less
gragnon
quietly
pronounced
a
judgment
which
the
numerous
gendarmes
who
were
present
immediately
put
into
execution
by
pushing
the
public
outside
there
was
an
extraordinary
outburst
of
emotion
a
perfect
scramble
followed
by
passionate
discussions
in
the
passages
during
the
two
hours
occupied
by
the
proceedings
the
excitement
kept
on
increasing
frightful
rumours
and
statements
circulated
as
if
what
was
being
said
in
court
filtered
through
the
walls
at
first
the
chatterers
dealt
with
the
report
on
the
examination
discussing
in
turn
every
expression
said
to
be
contained
in
it
and
adding
horrible
particulars
hitherto
unknown
to
anybody
but
absolutely
proving
simon
guilt
then
came
the
evidence
of
the
bongard
doloir
savin
and
milhomme
children
who
were
pictured
saying
things
they
had
never
said
however
people
were
convinced
that
all
had
been
corrupted
and
in
spite
of
delbos
protest
which
indeed
was
regarded
as
a
mere
comedy
it
was
declared
that
the
simonists
themselves
had
desired
proceedings
in
order
to
save
the
secular
school
of
maillebois
from
utter
disgrace
thus
was
not
condemnation
certain
besides
those
who
might
be
disturbed
by
the
lack
of
sufficient
proof
respecting
the
death
of
zéphirin
would
be
told
that
certain
things
had
been
stated
things
they
would
be
unable
to
control
knowing
nothing
of
them
when
the
doors
were
there
came
a
rush
people
swept
in
tumultuously
searching
and
sniffing
for
some
trace
of
the
monstrosities
they
had
imagined
but
during
the
remainder
of
the
sitting
they
heard
little
beyond
the
evidence
of
a
few
witnesses
for
the
defence
witnesses
as
to
character
among
whom
marc
figured
and
who
all
declared
simon
to
be
a
very
kind
and
gentle
man
fondly
attached
to
his
wife
and
children
only
one
witness
attracted
any
attention
this
being
mauraisin
the
elementary
inspector
who
had
felt
greatly
annoyed
by
the
citation
which
delbos
had
intentionally
sent
to
him
at
a
loss
between
his
desire
to
please
the
and
his
fear
of
displeasing
his
immediate
superior
le
barazer
whom
he
knew
to
be
discreetly
a
simonist
mauraisin
was
in
the
first
instance
obliged
to
admit
that
he
had
reported
most
favourably
on
simon
and
his
school
and
subsequently
he
could
only
qualify
those
reports
by
vague
insinuations
respecting
the
prisoner
sly
character
and
the
sectarian
violence
of
his
religious
passions
the
speeches
of
la
bissonnière
and
delbos
occupied
the
court
throughout
the
thursday
and
the
friday
during
the
earlier
proceedings
la
bissonnière
had
intervened
as
little
as
possible
spending
most
of
his
time
in
taking
notes
and
contemplating
his
at
heart
he
was
not
free
from
uneasiness
and
he
must
have
asked
himself
if
he
would
not
do
well
to
relinquish
certain
charges
as
some
of
the
proofs
were
so
very
fragile
thus
his
address
was
rather
spiritless
he
contented
himself
with
pointing
out
the
various
probabilities
of
guilt
and
ended
by
asking
merely
for
the
application
of
the
law
his
speech
had
lasted
barely
two
hours
its
success
was
meagre
and
the
anxiety
of
the
again
became
acute
not
enough
time
was
left
that
day
for
delbos
who
only
finished
his
speech
on
the
morrow
he
began
by
drawing
a
portrait
of
simon
showing
him
in
his
school
esteemed
and
loved
having
an
adorable
wife
and
beautiful
children
at
his
fireside
then
after
setting
forth
the
horrible
and
ignoble
circumstances
of
the
crime
the
advocate
asked
if
such
a
man
could
be
guilty
of
it
he
took
the
proofs
of
the
prosecution
one
by
one
and
demonstrated
their
nothingness
on
the
subject
of
the
and
the
report
of
the
experts
he
waxed
terrible
he
showed
that
the
ownership
of
the
one
document
in
the
case
could
not
be
attributed
to
simon
and
he
exposed
the
arrant
stupidity
of
the
report
drawn
up
by
masters
badoche
and
trabut
he
discussed
and
destroyed
every
item
of
evidence
even
that
which
had
been
taken
thereby
drawing
on
himself
all
the
thunders
of
president
gragnon
quite
a
violent
quarrel
arose
and
indeed
from
that
moment
delbos
spoke
under
the
constant
threat
of
being
arbitrarily
silenced
nevertheless
from
a
defender
he
became
an
accuser
he
cast
before
the
court
the
brothers
and
the
capuchins
and
the
jesuits
also
he
carried
the
case
back
to
father
crabot
in
order
that
he
might
strike
the
chief
of
the
coalition
as
he
desired
to
do
only
a
brother
he
said
could
have
committed
the
crime
and
although
he
did
not
name
brother
gorgias
he
designated
him
he
gave
all
the
reasons
on
which
his
conviction
was
based
he
pointed
out
all
the
underhand
devices
which
had
been
adopted
by
the
other
side
the
formation
of
a
great
clerical
conspiracy
of
which
simon
was
the
victim
and
the
necessity
for
the
plotters
that
an
innocent
man
should
be
condemned
in
order
that
the
real
culprit
might
be
saved
in
conclusion
he
cried
to
the
jury
that
it
was
not
the
murderer
of
little
zéphirin
but
the
secular
schoolmaster
the
jew
whom
they
were
really
asked
to
condemn
the
end
of
his
speech
though
rent
by
the
interruptions
of
the
presiding
judge
and
the
hooting
of
the
audience
was
on
the
whole
regarded
as
an
oratorical
triumph
which
placed
delbos
in
the
front
rank
but
for
which
his
client
no
doubt
would
pay
heavily
la
bissonnière
immediately
rose
to
reply
to
it
his
countenance
assuming
an
expression
of
grief
and
indignation
an
unqualifiable
scandal
had
taken
place
the
counsel
for
the
defence
had
dared
to
accuse
a
brother
without
producing
any
serious
proof
in
support
of
his
monstrous
allegation
he
had
done
worse
he
had
denounced
as
that
brother
accomplices
both
his
superiors
and
other
members
of
the
religious
orders
including
even
one
of
high
personality
before
whom
all
honest
folk
bowed
with
respect
religion
was
outraged
anarchist
passions
were
let
loose
those
who
acknowledged
neither
god
nor
patriotic
feeling
would
fain
precipitate
the
country
into
an
abyss
for
three
hours
la
bissonnière
went
on
denouncing
the
enemies
of
society
in
flowery
language
drawing
his
little
figure
erect
as
if
he
felt
he
were
at
last
rising
to
the
high
destiny
to
which
his
ambition
aspired
as
he
finished
he
became
ironical
he
wished
to
know
if
the
fact
of
being
a
jew
sufficed
to
make
a
man
innocent
and
then
he
asked
the
jury
for
all
its
severity
for
the
head
of
the
wretch
who
had
degraded
and
murdered
a
little
child
frantic
applause
burst
forth
and
delbos
by
his
vehement
rejoinder
full
of
exasperation
only
drew
on
himself
a
fresh
tempest
of
insults
and
threats
it
was
seven
in
the
evening
when
the
jurors
retired
to
consider
their
verdict
as
the
questions
put
to
them
by
the
court
were
few
in
number
it
was
hoped
that
matters
would
be
finished
in
less
than
an
hour
and
that
one
might
then
go
off
to
dine
night
had
fallen
and
the
few
big
lamps
placed
on
the
tables
did
not
suffice
to
illumine
the
great
hall
candles
which
looked
like
church
tapers
had
been
set
up
in
front
of
the
newspaper
reporters
who
were
still
working
the
atmosphere
was
hot
and
murky
but
not
a
lady
quitted
her
seat
the
crowd
stubbornly
remained
there
in
places
according
to
the
play
of
the
lights
which
threw
great
tragic
shadows
around
all
gave
full
rein
to
their
passions
there
was
a
deafening
uproar
of
voices
with
an
agitation
a
seething
and
bubbling
as
in
some
fermenting
vat
the
few
simonists
were
triumphant
they
declared
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
jury
to
convict
and
in
spite
of
the
noisy
applause
bestowed
on
la
bissonnière
reply
the
who
crowded
the
hall
showed
themselves
nervous
trembling
lest
the
expiatory
victim
should
escape
them
it
was
asserted
that
jacquin
the
foreman
of
the
jury
had
spoken
to
somebody
of
the
anguish
he
felt
in
presence
of
the
absolute
lack
of
proofs
and
three
other
jurymen
were
mentioned
as
having
appeared
favourable
to
the
prisoner
acquittal
became
possible
thus
there
was
angry
waiting
waiting
which
lasted
and
lasted
contrary
to
all
previous
expectations
eight
struck
nine
struck
and
still
the
jurors
did
not
return
they
had
been
shut
up
for
two
hours
unable
no
doubt
to
come
to
an
agreement
this
only
increased
the
general
uncertainty
and
although
the
door
of
the
jury
retiring
room
was
carefully
closed
rumours
came
from
it
nobody
knew
how
raising
the
agitation
of
the
ravenous
extenuated
impatient
throng
to
a
climax
all
at
once
it
was
learnt
that
the
foreman
acting
for
himself
and
his
colleagues
had
begged
the
presiding
judge
to
go
to
them
according
to
another
version
it
was
the
judge
who
had
placed
himself
at
their
disposal
insisting
to
see
them
which
seemed
a
scarcely
correct
proceeding
however
the
waiting
began
once
more
long
minutes
went
by
what
could
the
judge
be
doing
with
the
jurors
legally
he
might
only
acquaint
them
with
the
dispositions
of
the
law
should
they
be
ignorant
of
the
consequences
of
their
decision
but
the
delay
which
was
taking
place
appeared
very
long
for
a
simple
explanation
of
that
kind
and
indeed
a
fresh
rumour
suddenly
spread
among
gragnon
intimates
who
did
not
seem
at
all
struck
by
the
enormity
of
such
a
story
it
was
to
the
effect
that
a
document
had
reached
the
judge
after
the
close
of
the
proceedings
and
that
he
had
found
it
absolutely
necessary
to
lay
it
before
the
jurymen
though
the
prisoner
and
his
counsel
were
not
present
however
ten
struck
and
at
last
the
jury
reappeared
then
in
the
anxious
and
suddenly
silent
hall
when
the
judges
had
returned
and
taken
their
seats
their
robes
setting
red
blotches
against
the
background
of
shifting
darkness
architect
jacquin
the
foreman
arose
his
face
distinctly
seen
for
the
light
of
a
lamp
fell
on
it
was
very
pale
and
it
was
in
a
somewhat
weak
voice
that
he
pronounced
the
customary
formula
the
jury
answer
was
to
all
the
questions
but
it
granted
the
admission
of
extenuating
circumstances
illogically
of
course
and
with
the
sole
object
of
avoiding
the
capital
penalty
the
penalty
in
the
circumstances
was
penal
servitude
for
life
and
sentence
was
pronounced
by
president
gragnon
with
the
air
of
a
jolly
dog
and
the
jeering
nasal
accent
habitual
to
him
the
procureur
de
la
république
la
bissonnière
picked
up
his
papers
with
a
quick
gesture
like
a
man
relieved
and
delighted
at
having
secured
his
desire
from
the
audience
frantic
applause
had
risen
immediately
the
loud
baying
of
hungry
hounds
to
whom
the
quarry
was
at
last
flung
it
was
like
the
delirium
of
cannibals
gorging
themselves
with
human
flesh
and
yet
amid
that
tumult
fraught
with
horrid
savagery
above
all
the
ferocious
baying
there
rose
a
cry
simon
unceasing
cry
am
innocent
i
am
innocent
a
loud
and
stubborn
call
which
sowed
truth
in
worthy
hearts
whilst
advocate
delbos
with
tears
springing
to
his
eyes
leant
towards
the
condemned
man
and
embraced
him
like
a
brother
david
who
had
abstained
from
appearing
in
court
in
order
that
he
might
give
no
occasion
for
an
increase
of
hatred
awaited
the
result
at
delbos
rooms
in
the
rue
fontanier
until
ten
he
remained
counting
the
minutes
consumed
by
the
most
torturing
fever
knowing
not
whether
he
ought
to
rejoice
or
despair
at
such
delay
he
continually
went
to
the
window
to
lean
out
and
listen
to
the
sounds
in
the
distance
and
the
very
atmosphere
of
the
street
and
the
exclamations
of
a
few
people
passing
had
already
imparted
to
him
the
fatal
tidings
when
marc
arrived
sobbing
exhausted
and
confirmed
them
salvan
accompanied
marc
salvan
whom
the
young
man
had
met
on
quitting
the
court
and
who
was
also
beside
himself
there
came
an
hour
of
tragic
despair
of
utter
collapse
when
all
that
was
good
and
just
seemed
to
be
engulfed
for
ever
and
when
delbos
after
an
interview
with
simon
whom
he
had
found
stricken
yet
still
erect
arrived
in
his
turn
he
could
only
cast
himself
on
david
neck
and
embrace
him
even
as
he
had
embraced
his
brother
yonder
weep
my
friend
he
cried
is
the
greatest
iniquity
of
the
century
iv
on
his
return
to
jonville
after
the
vacation
that
year
marc
had
found
himself
engaged
in
another
struggle
one
having
no
connection
with
simon
case
his
adversary
abbé
cognasse
the
parish
priest
anxious
to
get
him
into
difficulties
had
decided
to
make
an
effort
to
win
over
the
village
mayor
one
martineau
a
peasant
through
the
latter
wife
beautiful
martineau
as
she
was
called
abbé
cognasse
was
a
terrible
man
tall
lean
and
angular
with
a
determined
chin
and
a
sharp
nose
under
a
low
brow
and
a
thick
mane
of
dark
hair
his
eyes
glowed
with
aggressive
fire
his
knotty
hands
which
he
seldom
washed
seemed
made
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
throttling
those
who
dared
to
resist
him
forty
years
of
age
he
kept
one
servant
palmyre
an
old
maid
of
sixty
who
was
inclined
to
be
humpbacked
and
who
was
yet
more
terrible
than
her
master
so
miserly
and
harsh
indeed
that
she
was
regarded
as
the
terror
of
the
district
the
priest
was
said
to
lead
a
chaste
life
but
he
ate
a
great
deal
and
he
drank
very
copiously
though
without
intoxicating
himself
a
peasant
son
and
therefore
narrow
and
stubborn
in
his
opinions
he
always
insisted
upon
his
rights
and
his
dues
never
foregoing
a
single
copper
of
the
latter
even
when
the
poorest
of
his
parishioners
was
in
question
thus
he
was
very
anxious
to
hold
mayor
martineau
in
his
power
in
order
to
become
the
real
master
of
the
commune
and
thereby
increase
his
own
profits
as
well
as
assure
the
triumph
of
religion
as
for
his
quarrel
with
marc
this
had
arisen
over
a
sum
of
thirty
francs
a
year
which
the
parish
had
arranged
to
pay
the
schoolmaster
for
ringing
the
church
bell
and
which
marc
for
a
time
duly
received
although
he
absolutely
refused
to
put
his
hands
to
the
martineau
was
not
easily
won
over
when
he
found
himself
supported
of
the
same
age
as
the
priest
square
of
face
and
sturdy
of
build
ruddy
and
he
spoke
little
and
evinced
great
caution
he
was
said
to
be
the
wealthiest
cultivator
of
the
commune
and
his
extensive
property
gaining
him
the
favour
of
his
fellow
parishioners
he
had
been
mayor
of
jonville
for
ten
years
past
scarcely
knowing
how
to
read
and
write
he
did
not
care
to
pronounce
openly
between
the
church
and
the
school
he
thought
it
best
to
affect
neutrality
though
he
always
ended
by
siding
with
one
or
the
other
according
whether
he
felt
the
priest
or
the
schoolmaster
to
be
the
stronger
in
the
depths
of
his
heart
he
was
inclined
to
favour
the
latter
for
in
his
veins
coursed
some
of
that
ancient
rancour
which
animates
the
french
peasant
against
the
priest
whom
he
regards
as
an
idle
man
bent
on
enjoying
life
one
indeed
who
does
nothing
and
yet
requires
to
be
paid
and
who
captures
the
wives
and
daughters
of
his
parishioners
in
the
name
of
an
invisible
jealous
and
deity
but
if
martineau
did
not
follow
the
church
observances
he
had
never
opposed
his
without
assistance
for
he
held
that
the
were
extremely
clever
whatever
else
might
be
said
about
them
thus
it
was
largely
because
marc
displayed
so
much
quiet
energy
and
intelligence
that
martineau
had
joined
his
side
allowing
him
to
go
forward
without
pledging
himself
too
much
but
it
occurred
to
abbé
cognasse
to
make
use
of
the
mayor
wife
the
beautiful
martineau
who
although
she
was
not
one
of
his
penitents
attended
church
very
regularly
on
sundays
and
festivals
very
dark
with
large
eyes
a
fresh
mouth
and
a
buxom
figure
she
was
coquettishly
inclined
fond
of
exhibiting
a
new
gown
of
airing
a
lace
cap
of
arraying
herself
in
her
gold
jewellery
her
assiduity
at
mass
was
due
to
that
alone
had
become
her
diversion
there
was
no
other
spot
whither
she
could
repair
in
full
dress
to
show
herself
and
pass
her
neighbours
in
review
indeed
in
that
village
of
less
than
eight
hundred
souls
for
lack
of
any
other
meeting
place
and
occasion
for
ceremony
and
festival
the
damp
little
nave
of
the
church
where
mass
was
so
hastily
celebrated
became
the
the
theatre
the
one
general
parade
and
recreation
ground
of
the
women
who
were
desirous
of
pleasing
those
who
went
thither
were
influenced
very
little
by
faith
their
craving
was
to
wear
their
sunday
finery
and
to
show
themselves
their
mothers
had
done
it
their
daughters
would
do
it
also
it
was
the
general
custom
as
for
madame
martineau
on
being
approached
and
flattered
by
abbé
cognasse
she
endeavoured
to
convince
her
husband
that
the
priest
was
right
in
the
matter
of
the
thirty
francs
but
martineau
sharply
bade
her
hold
her
tongue
and
return
to
her
cows
for
he
belonged
to
the
old
school
and
did
not
allow
women
to
meddle
in
matters
which
concerned
men
in
itself
the
story
of
the
thirty
francs
was
very
simple
ever
since
there
had
been
a
schoolmaster
at
jonville
he
had
been
paid
that
sum
annually
to
ring
the
church
bell
but
marc
being
unwilling
to
do
so
ended
by
persuading
the
parish
council
to
devote
the
money
to
another
purpose
if
the
priest
needed
a
bellringer
he
could
surely
pay
for
one
himself
but
the
old
clock
in
the
church
steeple
was
in
a
sad
condition
constantly
losing
time
and
a
former
clockmaker
dwelling
in
the
vicinity
was
willing
to
repair
it
and
keep
it
in
working
order
for
that
very
sum
of
thirty
francs
a
year
it
was
with
some
little
malice
that
marc
suggested
the
acceptance
of
the
offer
while
the
peasants
reflected
and
sounded
themselves
wondering
whether
their
interests
would
be
best
served
by
having
the
bell
rung
for
mass
or
by
having
a
clock
to
tell
them
the
correct
time
as
for
ensuring
both
services
by
voting
an
additional
thirty
francs
they
never
gave
that
point
a
moment
thought
for
their
policy
was
to
burden
the
parish
with
no
useless
expense
whatever
nevertheless
there
was
a
fine
tussle
in
which
the
influence
of
the
priest
and
that
of
the
schoolmaster
came
into
collision
the
latter
finally
remaining
victorious
in
spite
of
the
maledictions
which
abbé
cognasse
in
his
sermons
heaped
on
the
impious
folk
who
by
silencing
the
bell
wished
to
silence
the
call
of
religion
one
fine
sunday
morning
however
after
a
month
quietude
a
succession
of
furious
peals
resounded
from
the
church
steeple
and
people
then
discovered
that
the
priest
old
servant
the
terrible
palmyre
was
ringing
the
bell
with
all
the
furious
strength
of
her
wiry
little
arms
abbé
cognasse
understood
that
the
mayor
was
escaping
him
and
though
inwardly
aglow
with
anger
he
henceforth
became
prudent
displaying
all
the
flexible
craft
of
his
cloth
then
as
martineau
grew
conscious
of
the
firmness
of
the
hands
to
which
he
had
confided
himself
he
more
and
more
frequently
consulted
marc
who
at
last
felt
that
he
was
master
as
parish
clerk
the
young
man
ended
by
discreetly
guiding
the
council
duly
respecting
the
of
its
members
and
remaining
in
the
background
content
to
inspire
those
peasants
whose
chief
desire
was
for
quietude
and
prosperity
with
intelligence
sense
and
healthy
determination
under
the
young
man
auspices
education
spread
casting
light
upon
all
things
destroying
foolish
superstitions
and
driving
not
only
mental
poverty
but
also
the
poverty
of
homes
away
for
wealth
comes
with
knowledge
never
indeed
had
jonville
made
so
much
progress
it
was
becoming
the
most
prosperous
and
the
happiest
parish
of
the
department
it
must
be
said
that
marc
was
greatly
assisted
in
his
work
by
mademoiselle
mazeline
the
mistress
of
the
girls
school
which
a
wall
alone
separated
from
the
boys
school
where
the
young
man
was
master
short
and
dark
quite
destitute
of
beauty
but
very
charming
with
a
broad
face
a
full
kindly
mouth
fine
black
eyes
glowing
with
tenderness
and
abnegation
beneath
a
lofty
and
bossy
brow
mademoiselle
mazeline
was
all
intelligence
sense
healthy
and
upright
determination
like
one
born
to
educate
and
emancipate
the
little
girls
confided
to
her
she
came
from
that
training
school
of
which
thanks
to
the
heart
and
mind
of
an
illustrious
master
has
already
sent
forth
a
whole
cohort
of
able
pioneers
whose
mission
it
is
to
form
the
wives
and
mothers
of
and
if
at
six
and
twenty
years
of
age
the
young
woman
was
already
mistress
of
a
school
it
was
thanks
to
her
intelligent
superiors
salvan
and
le
barazer
who
were
giving
her
a
trial
in
that
lonely
village
in
order
to
ascertain
if
she
would
turn
out
the
good
work
which
they
awaited
at
heart
they
felt
some
anxiety
on
account
of
her
advanced
opinions
fearing
that
she
might
indispose
her
parents
by
her
views
her
conviction
that
woman
would
only
bring
happiness
to
the
world
when
she
was
at
last
delivered
from
the
priests
but
mademoiselle
mazeline
behaved
with
great
sense
and
good
humour
and
if
she
did
not
take
her
girls
to
mass
she
treated
them
in
such
a
motherly
fashion
taught
them
and
cared
for
them
so
affectionately
that
the
peasants
became
deeply
attached
to
her
thus
she
greatly
helped
marc
in
his
work
by
proving
that
although
one
may
not
go
to
mass
and
although
one
may
set
one
belief
more
particularly
in
human
work
and
conscientiousness
one
may
nevertheless
become
the
most
intelligent
most
upright
and
kindly
woman
in
the
world
but
abbé
cognasse
whatever
his
repulse
at
jonville
fully
revenged
himself
at
le
moreux
a
little
parish
some
two
and
a
half
miles
distant
which
having
no
priest
of
its
own
was
dependent
upon
him
if
however
there
were
less
than
two
hundred
inhabitants
at
le
moreux
and
if
the
village
was
hidden
away
among
the
hills
the
difficult
roads
cutting
it
off
from
frequent
intercourse
with
the
rest
of
the
world
on
the
other
hand
it
was
by
no
means
a
wretched
spot
its
only
poor
family
was
that
of
its
schoolmaster
all
the
others
possessed
fertile
lands
and
lived
with
hardly
a
care
amid
the
sleepy
quietude
of
routine
saleur
the
mayor
a
short
stout
man
with
a
bovine
muzzle
and
little
or
no
neck
had
been
a
grazier
and
had
suddenly
made
a
fortune
by
selling
his
meadow
lands
herds
and
flocks
at
a
high
price
to
a
company
which
wished
to
syndicate
all
the
in
the
department
since
then
he
had
transformed
his
house
into
a
coquettish
villa
and
had
become
a
sending
his
son
honoré
to
the
beaumont
lycée
before
letting
him
go
as
a
student
to
paris
although
the
people
of
moreux
were
jealous
of
saleur
they
reappointed
him
mayor
at
each
election
for
the
reason
that
having
to
do
nothing
for
a
living
he
was
well
able
to
attend
to
the
parish
affairs
he
however
cast
them
upon
the
shoulders
of
férou
the
schoolmaster
who
as
parish
clerk
received
an
annual
salary
of
one
hundred
and
eighty
francs
in
return
for
which
he
had
to
perform
no
little
work
keep
the
registers
draw
up
reports
write
letters
and
attend
to
something
or
other
at
almost
every
moment
saleur
was
dense
and
heavy
crassly
ignorant
scarce
able
to
sign
his
name
and
though
not
harsh
at
bottom
he
treated
férou
as
if
the
latter
were
a
mere
writing
machine
regarding
him
indeed
with
the
quiet
contempt
of
a
man
who
had
needed
nothing
like
so
much
learning
to
make
his
fortune
and
live
at
his
ease
moreover
the
mayor
bore
the
schoolmaster
a
grudge
for
having
quarrelled
with
abbé
cognasse
by
refusing
to
take
his
pupils
to
church
and
sing
as
a
choirman
it
was
not
that
saleur
himself
followed
the
observances
of
the
church
for
it
was
merely
as
a
supporter
of
the
cause
of
order
that
he
went
to
mass
with
his
wife
a
lean
insignificant
woman
who
was
neither
devout
nor
coquettish
but
who
also
regarded
attendance
at
church
on
sundays
as
a
social
duty
thus
saleur
grudge
against
férou
arose
simply
from
the
circumstance
that
the
schoolmaster
rebellious
attitude
aggravated
the
quarrels
which
were
perpetually
occurring
between
the
priest
of
jonville
and
the
inhabitants
of
le
moreux
footnote
about
for
instance
the
latter
complained
that
the
priest
treated
them
with
little
or
no
respect
that
they
only
obtained
from
him
some
scraps
of
masses
bestowed
on
them
like
alms
that
they
were
compelled
to
send
their
children
to
jonville
for
the
catechism
classes
and
the
first
communion
and
that
all
sorts
of
difficulties
were
placed
in
their
way
with
respect
to
weddings
baptisms
and
churchings
whereupon
the
infuriated
abbé
retorted
that
when
folk
wished
to
obtain
favours
from
heaven
their
first
duty
was
to
provide
themselves
with
a
priest
of
their
own
on
weekdays
when
it
was
invariably
closed
the
church
of
le
moreux
looked
like
a
dismal
empty
barn
but
for
half
an
hour
every
sunday
abbé
cognasse
swept
down
on
it
like
a
tempest
feared
by
everybody
and
terrorising
the
parish
with
his
capriciousness
and
his
violence
marc
who
was
acquainted
with
the
situation
could
not
think
of
férou
without
feeling
much
compassionate
sympathy
in
that
village
of
le
moreux
he
the
schoolmaster
alone
was
unable
to
satisfy
his
hunger
the
horrible
misery
which
assails
so
many
poor
schoolmasters
became
in
his
case
most
tragically
acute
he
had
made
his
at
maillebois
as
an
assistant
teacher
with
a
salary
of
nine
hundred
francs
when
he
was
years
of
age
and
now
after
six
years
work
exiled
to
le
moreux
on
account
of
his
bitter
disposition
he
still
only
received
a
thousand
francs
a
year
or
allowing
for
the
amount
deducted
for
the
pension
fund
francs
a
month
that
is
to
say
sous
a
day
yet
he
had
a
wife
and
three
little
girls
to
keep
black
misery
reigned
in
the
damp
old
hovel
which
served
as
a
school
the
food
was
often
such
as
dogs
would
have
scorned
to
touch
the
girls
went
about
shoeless
the
wife
did
not
possess
a
decent
gown
and
indebtedness
was
always
increasing
the
threatening
deadly
indebtedness
in
which
so
many
humble
servants
of
the
state
become
engulfed
while
those
at
the
head
of
affairs
are
often
wickedly
paid
six
times
as
much
as
their
services
deserve
how
great
was
the
courage
the
heroism
which
férou
needed
to
try
to
hide
that
misery
to
remain
erect
in
his
threadbare
to
hold
his
rank
as
a
man
of

had
retained

some
little

to
the

teaching
them
to
read
and
sew
while
he
had
on
his
hands
the
dense
and
malicious
boys
under
all
the
circumstances
was
it
surprising
that
he
sometimes
yielded
to
the
discouragement
which
comes
from
ungrateful
toil
to
the
sudden
rebellion
of
his
suffering
heart
born
poor
he
had
always
suffered
from
poverty
ill
fed
and
ill
clad
and
now
that
he
was
a
monsieur
his
poverty
became
the
more
frightfully
bitter
around
him
he
saw
only
happy
folk
peasants
possessed
of
lands
able
to
eat
their
fill
proud
of
the
they
had
put
by
most
of
them
were
brutish
scarcely
able
to

they
invariably
needed
his
help
when
a
letter
had
to
be
drafted
yet
he
the
only
man
of
intellect
education
and
culture
among
them
often
lacked
a
franc
to
buy
himself
a
couple
of
new
collars
or
to
pay
for
the
repair
of
his
old
shoes
and
the
others
treated
him
as
a
lackey
overwhelmed
him
with
scorn
jeered
at
his
ragged
coat
of
which
at
heart
they
were
jealous
but
the
comparison
which
they
drew
between
him
the
schoolmaster
and
abbé
cognasse
the
priest
was
particularly
unfavourable
to
férou
the
schoolmaster
was
so
poorly
paid
and
so
wretched
he
was
treated
impertinently
by
his
pupils
and
disdainfully
by
their
parents
he
was
destitute
too
of
all
authority
unsupported
by
his
superiors
whereas
the
priest
far
more
liberally
remunerated
receiving
moreover
all
sorts
of
presents
in
addition
to
his
stipend
was
backed
up
by
his
bishop
and
petted
by
the
devout
whilst
as
for
authority
he
spoke
like
one
who
had
only
to
address
himself
to
his
master
to
bring
as
he
pleased
thunder
or
rain
or
sunshine
on
the
crops
thus
although
abbé
cognasse
was
always
quarrelling
with
the
folk
of
le
moreux
and
although
they
had
lost
their
faith
and
had
almost
ceased
to
follow
the
observances
of
religion
he
still
reigned
over
them
and
thus
on
the
other
hand
schoolmaster
férou
tortured
by
his
life
of
indigence
gorged
with
bitterness
turned
into
a
socialist
by
sheer
force
of
circumstances
drew
bad
reports
upon
himself
by
expressing
subversive
views
with
respect
to
that
social
system
which
condemned
him
the
representative
of
intelligence
and
knowledge
to
starve
whilst
all
around
him
stupidity

possessed

only
received
a

made
both

besides
little
presents
in

at

since
the

however
she
had
given
nothing
and
marc
was
almost
relieved
for
the
harsh
words
accompanying
each
of
her
presents
had
often
hurt
his
feelings

how
straitened
did
the

now
become
and
what

were

marc
who

dolorous
ardour
and
nobody
on
seeing
him
at
work
punctually
discharging
each
duty
through
those
first
winter
months
so
hard
to
the
poor
had
any
suspicion
of
the
sombre
grief
the
bitter
despair
which
he
hid
so
jealously
beneath
a
brave
assumption
of
tranquillity
he
had
remained
sorely

ever
since

of

the
wound
dealt
him
by
that
monstrous
iniquity
would
not

in
moments
of

he
lapsed
into
black

often
heard
him
exclaim

i
knew

i
did
not

yes
how
had
it
been
possible
for
such
an
infamous
thing
to
take
place
in
france
the
france
of
the
great
revolution
which
marc
had
regarded
hitherto
as
the
deliverer
and
justiciar
promised
to
the

he
loved
his
country
dearly
for
its
generosity
for
its
independent
courage
for
all
the
noble
and
great
work
which
he
thought
it
was
destined
to
accomplish
and
now
it
allowed
nay
actually
demanded
the
condemnation
of
an
innocent
man
and
it
reverted
to
the
imbecility
the
barbarity
of
ancient
days
had
it
been
changed
had
it
been
poisoned
to
bring
about
that
dementia
grief
and
shame
haunted
him
it
was
as
if
he
himself
had
had
a
share
in
that
crime
and
with
his
eager
passion
for
truth
and
his
craving
to
impose
it
upon
all
he
felt
intolerable
discomfort
when
he
saw
falsehood
triumph
and
found
himself
powerless
to
fight
and
destroy
it
by
shouting
aloud
the
truth
which
he
had
sought
so
zealously
he
lived
through
the
affair
again
he
still
sought
and
sought
without
discovering
anything
more
so
great
was
the
tangle
created
by
invisible
hands
and
after
his
long
hours
of
teaching
such
despair
at
times
came
over
him
in
the
evening
that
geneviève
gently
cast
her
arms
about
him
and
kissed
him
tenderly
desirous
of
giving
him
a
little
comfort
will
make
yourself
ill
my
poor
friend
she
said
think
of
those
sad
things
any
more
tears
came
to
his
eyes
so
deeply
was
he
touched
in
his
turn
he
kissed
her
tenderly
yes
he
answered
are
right
one
must
be
brave
but
how
can
i
help
it
i
can
not
prevent
myself
from
thinking
and
it
is
great
torment
then
smiling
and
raising
a
finger
to
her
lips
she
led
him
to
the
cot
where
little
louise
was
already
fast
asleep
must
only
think
of
our
darling
you
must
say
to
yourself
that
we
are
working
for
her
she
will
be
happy
if
we
are
that
would
be
the
more
sensible
course
but
then
is
not
our
happiness
to
come
from
the
happiness
of
all
geneviève
had
evinced
much
sense
and
affection
throughout
the
affair
she
had
been
grieved
by
the
demeanour
of
her
grandmother
towards
her
husband
to
whom
during
the
last
days
spent
at
maillebois
even
pélagie
with
spiteful
affectation
had
never
spoken
thus
when
the
young
people
had
quitted
the
house
on
the
place
des
capucins
the
parting
had
been
a
very
cold
one
and
since
that
time
geneviève
had
contented
herself
with
calling
on
her
relations
at
long
intervals
by
way
of
avoiding
a
complete
rupture
now
that
she
was
back
at
jonville
she
had
again
ceased
to
attend
mass
for
she
did
not
wish
to
give
abbé
cognasse
any
opportunity
to
approach
her
and
endeavour
to
undermine
her
affection
for
her
husband
evincing
no
interest
in
the
quarrel
between
the
church
and
the
school
she
was
content
to
cling
to
marc
neck
and
like
a
woman
who
has
given
herself
entirely
to
the
loved
one
it
was
in
his
arms
that
she
sought
a
refuge
even
when
heredity
and
the
effects
of
a
catholic
education
prevented
her
from
fully
approving
his
actions
perhaps
in
the
simon
affair
she
did
not
think
as
he
did
but
she
knew
how
loyal
generous
and
just
he
was
and
she
could
not
blame
him
for
acting
according
to
his
conscience
nevertheless
like
a
sensible
woman
she
occasionally
recalled
him
to
prudence
what
would
have
become
of
them
and
their
child
if
he
had
compromised
himself
so
far
as
to
lose
his
position
at
the
same
time
they
loved
each
other
so
much
they
were
still
so
full
of
passion
one
for
the
other
that
no
quarrel
between
them
had
a
chance
of
becoming
serious
the
slightest
disagreement
ended
in
an
embrace
a
great
quiver
and
a
rain
of
ardent
kisses
my
dear
dear
geneviève
when
one
has
given
oneself
one
can
never
take
oneself
back
yes
my
dear
marc
i
am
yours
i
know
how
good
you
are
do
with
me
as
you
please
he
allowed
her
all
freedom
had
she
gone
to
mass
he
would
not
have
tried
to
prevent
her
whatever
might
be
his
own
views
he
wished
to
respect
her
liberty
of
conscience
and
as
christening
was
a
usual
thing
he
had
not
thought
of
opposing
the
baptism
of
little
louise
when
at
times
he
felt
worried
by
the
divergence
of
religious
views
he
asked
himself
if
love
did
not
suffice
as
a
remedy
for
everything
if
one
did
not
always
end
by
agreeing
whatever
catastrophe
might
befall
when
every
evening
there
came
the
closest
union
husband
and
wife
having
but
one
heart
and
one
being
if
the
simon
affair
continued
to
haunt
marc
it
was
because
he
was
unable
to
cease
occupying
himself
with
it
he
had
vowed
that
he
would
never
rest
until
he
should
discover
the
real
culprit
and
he
kept
his
word
influenced
more
by
passion
than
by
strict
duty
on
thursdays
when
his
afternoons
were
free
he
hastened
to
maillebois
to
call
at
the
lehmanns
dark
and
dismal
shop
in
the
rue
du
trou
the
condemnation
of
simon
had
fallen
on
that
wretched
dwelling
like
a
thunderbolt
public
execration
seemed
to
cast
the
convict
family
his
friends
and
even
the
few
acquaintances
who
remained
faithful
to
him
out
of
the
pale
of
humanity
lehmann
and
his
wife
who
evinced
such
wretched
resignation
to
their
lot
were
forsaken
by
their
customers
and
would
have
starved
had
they
not
secured
some
for
parisian
clothiers
but
it
was
particularly
madame
simon
the
mournful
rachel
and
her
little
children
joseph
and
sarah
who
suffered
from
the
savage
hatred
assailing
their
name
it
had
been
impossible
for
the
children
to
return
to
school
the
hooted
them
pelted
them
with
stones
and
one
day
the
little
boy
came
home
with
his
lip
badly
cut
by
a
missile
as
for
the
mother
who
had
assumed
mourning
and
whose
beauty
became
the
more
dazzling
in
the
plain
black
gown
which
she
always
wore
she
spent
her
days
in
weeping
relying
only
on
some
prodigy
for
salvation
alone
among
the
inmates
of
the
desolate
house
amid
the
yielding
grief
of
the
others
did
david
remain
erect
silent
and
active
still
seeking
and
still
hoping
he
had
allotted
to
himself
a
superhuman
task
that
of
saving
and
rehabilitating
his
brother
he
had
sworn
to
him
at
their
last
interview
that
he
would
dedicate
his
life
to
the
work
of
penetrating
the
frightful
mystery
of
discovering
the
real
murderer
and
of
dragging
the
truth
into
the
broad
light
of
day
thus
he
had
definitively
placed
the
working
of
his
sand
and
gravel
pits
in
the
hands
of
a
reliable
manager
knowing
that
if
he
should
lack
money
he
would
from
the
outset
find
his
efforts
crippled
personally
he
devoted
himself
entirely
to
his
search
for
the
truth
ever
following
up
the
slightest
clues
ever
deep
in
the
quest
for
new
facts
if
it
had
been
possible
for
his
zeal
to
weaken
the
letters
from
cayenne
which
his
at
long
intervals
received
from
his
brother
would
have
sufficed
to
inflame
his
courage
simon
departure
his
embarkation
with
other
unhappy
beings
the
awful
voyage
the
arrival
yonder
amid
all
the
horrors
of
the
penal
settlement
those
were
scorching
memories
which
threw
david
into
indescribable
agitation
which
returned
amid
dreadful
shudders
at
each
and
every
hour
and
now
came
letters
doctored
and
amputated
by
the
officials
yet
allowing
one
to
detect
beneath
each
phrase
the
cry
of
one
who
was
enduring
intolerable
torture
the
revolt
of
an
innocent
man
for
ever
brooding
over
his
pretended
crime
and
at
a
loss
to
understand
why
it
was
that
he
should
expiate
another
deed
was
not
madness
at
the
end
of
that
devouring
anguish
simon
alluded
gently
to
the
thieves
and
assassins
his
companions
and
one
could
divine
that
his
hatred
was
directed
against
the
keepers
the
torturers
who
uncontrolled
far
removed
from
the
civilised
world
became
like
the
wild
men
of
primeval
caverns
gloating
over
the
sufferings
they
inflicted
upon
other
men
it
was
a
sphere
of
mire
and
blood
and
one
evening
a
pardoned
convict
recounted
such
horrible
particulars
to
david
in
marc
presence
that
the
two
friends
their
bleeding
hearts
wrung
by
terror
and
compassion
were
stirred
to
furious
protest
and
cried
their
pain
aloud
unfortunately
the
ceaseless
inquiries
which
both
david
and
marc
prosecuted
with
discreet
stubbornness
yielded
no
great
result
they
had
resolved
to
keep
a
watch
on
the
brothers
school
at
maillebois
and
particularly
on
brother
gorgias
whom
they
still
suspected
but
a
month
after
the
trial
all
three
of
the
assistant
brothers
isidore
lazarus
and
gorgias
disappeared
together
being
sent
to
some
other
community
at
the
other
end
of
france
brother
fulgence
the
director
alone
remained
at
maillebois
where
three
new
ignorantines
joined
him
david
and
marc
could
draw
no
positive
conclusions
from
this
incident
for
the
brothers
often
went
from
one
establishment
to
another
besides
as
all
three
assistants
had
been
removed
it
was
impossible
to
tell
to
which
one
of
them
that
removal
was
really
due
so
far
as
maillebois
was
concerned
the
worst
result
of
condemnation
had
been
the
terrible
blow
dealt
to
the
communal
school
from
which
several
families
had
withdrawn
their
children
in
order
to
confide
them
to
the
brothers
who
had
never
previously
known
such
great
prosperity
nowadays
the
victorious
faces
of
priests
monks
and
brothers
were
met
on
all
sides
in
the
town
and
the
new
master
appointed
to
succeed
simon
a
pale
and
puny
little
fellow
named
méchain
seemed
scarcely
the
man
to
resist
that
invading
tide
he
was
said
to
be
consumptive
and
he
certainly
suffered
a
great
deal
from
the
severity
of
the
winter
when
he
left
his
boys
largely
in
the
charge
of
mignot
who
always
at
a
loss
when
he
was
not
guided
now
took
the
advice
of
mademoiselle
rouzaire
she
was
more
than
ever
on
the
side
of
the
clerical
faction
which
at
present
reigned
over
the
region
and
thus
she
persuaded
mignot
to
take
the
boys
to
mass
and
even
set
up
a
large
wooden
crucifix
in
the
classroom
these
things
were
tolerated
in
official
spheres
where
it
was
thought
perhaps
that
they
might
have
a
good
effect
on
certain
families
and
facilitate
the
return
of
children
to
the
communal
school
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
maillebois
was
going
over
to
the
clericals
and
the
crisis
had
become
extremely
serious
marc
desolation
increased
as
he
observed
the
spirit
of
ignorance
enthroned
over
the
region
simon
name
had
become
a
bogie
name
one
could
not
mention
it
without
driving
people
wild
with
rage
and
fear
they
regarded
it
as
an
accursed
name
which
brought
misfortune
a
name
that
summed
up
all
human
iniquity
silence
ought
to
be
observed
no
allusion
however
slight
ought
to
be
made
to
it
for
otherwise
one
might
draw
the
most
dreadful
catastrophes
upon
the
country
a
few
men
of
sensible
upright
minds
had
certainly
felt
greatly
disturbed
since
the
trial
and
had
even
admitted
the
possibility
of
the
condemned
innocence
but
in
presence
of
the
furious
wave
of
public
opinion
they
no
longer
spoke
they
even
advised
their
friends
to
remain
silent
what
would
be
the
use
of
protesting
of
endeavouring
to
secure
justice
why
should
one
expose
oneself
to
utter
ruin
without
rendering
any
practical
help
to
anybody
at
each
indication
furnished
by
circumstances
marc
felt
stupefied
at
finding
everybody
crouching
in
falsehood
and
error
as
in
some
pond
of
filthy
slimy
poisonous
water
on
various
occasions
he
happened
to
meet
bongard
the
farmer
doloir
the
mason
and
savin
the
clerk
and
he
quite
understood
that
all
three
had
been
minded
to
withdraw
their
children
from
the
communal
school
and
send
them
to
the
brothers
and
that
if
they
had
abstained
from
doing
so
it
was
only
from
some
dim
fear
that
they
might
thereby
harm
themselves
with
the
authorities
bongard
who
kept
very
quiet
at
a
loss
whether
to
side
with
the
priests
or
the
government
ended
however
by
relating
that
the
jews
spread
the
cattle
plague
through
the
country
for
his
two
children
had
seen
a
man
throwing
some
white
powder
into
a
well
doloir
on
his
side
talked
of
an
international
jew
syndicate
which
had
been
formed
to
sell
france
to
germany
and
threatened
to
box
the
ears
of
méchain
the
new
schoolmaster
if
his
boys
auguste
and
charles
should
learn
anything
wrong
at
that
communal
school
where
children
were
corrupted
then
savin
became
more
bitter
than
ever
haunted
at
times
by
the
idea
that
if
he
vegetated
it
was
because
he
had
not
joined
the
freemasons
and
at
others
covertly
regretting
that
he
had
not
openly
become
a
partisan
of
the
church
at
one
moment
also
he
declared
the
simon
affair
to
have
been
a
comedy
one
culprit
had
been
sacrificed
to
save
all
the
others
and
to
hide
what
went
on
in
every
school
of
france
whether
it
were
secular
or
religious
thus
to
save
his
children
hortense
achille
and
philippe
from
perdition
he
thought
of
removing
them
from
school
altogether
and
allowing
them
to
grow
up
as
nature
might
direct
marc
listened
to
it
all
feeling
quite
upset
and
at
a
loss
to
understand
how
people
of
any
sense
could
reach
such
a
degree
of
aberration
there
was
something
more
than
innate
ignorance
in
such
mentality
it
had
been
created
by
the
continuous
working
of
all
the
stupid
things
which
were
currently
said
by
the
growth
of
popular
prejudices
through
the
ages
by
the
virus
of
all
the
superstitions
and
legends
which
destroyed
men
reason
and
how
was
purification
possible
how
could
one
cure
those
poor
ailing
intoxicated
people
and
endow
them
with
good
health
intellectually
and
morally
marc
experienced
deep
emotion
one
day
when
he
went
to
buy
a
schoolbook
of
the
mesdames
milhomme
the
stationers
in
the
rue
courte
both
of
them
were
in
the
shop
with
their
sons
madame
alexander
with
sébastien
and
madame
edouard
with
victor
marc
was
served
by
the
latter
lady
who
though
she
seemed
taken
aback
when
he
suddenly
entered
promptly
recovered
her
assurance
and
frowned
with
an
expression
of
harsh
and
egotistical
determination
but
madame
alexandre
had
risen
quivering
and
under
the
pretence
of
making
sébastien
wash
his
hands
she
at
once
led
him
away
marc
was
deeply
stirred
by
that
flight
it
was
a
proof
of
what
he
suspected
the
great
perturbation
that
had
reigned
in
that
home
ever
since
simon
the
innocent
man
had
been
condemned
would
the
truth
ever
come
from
that
little
shop
then
he
knew
not
and
feeling
more
distressed
than
ever
he
withdrew
after
allowing
madame
edouard
to
tell
him
some
extraordinary
tales
by
way
of
masking
her
weakness
an
old
lady
customer
of
hers
she
said
often
dreamt
of
poor
little
zéphirin
simon
victim
who
appeared
to
her
bearing
a
martyr
palm
and
since
the
brothers
school
had
been
suspected
by
the
freethinkers
it
had
been
granted
the
visible
protection
of
heaven
for
on
three
different
occasions
surrounding
buildings
had
been
struck
by
lightning
whereas
the
school
had
remained
unharmed
finally
apropos
of
some
administrative
affair
marc
had
occasion
to
call
on
darras
the
mayor
who
had
always
been
regarded
as
a
simonist
having
openly
displayed
his
sympathy
with
the
prisoner
at
the
time
of
the
trial
but
after
all
he
was
a
functionary
and
did
not
his
position
now
compel
him
to
observe
complete
neutrality
his
discretion
was
increased
by
some
little
cowardice
a
fear
of
coming
into
collision
with
the
majority
of
the
electors
and
of
losing
his
position
of
mayor
of
which
he
was
so
proud
so
when
marc
business
was
settled
and
the
young
man
ventured
to
question
him
he
raised
his
arms
to
the
ceiling
despairingly
he
could
do
nothing
he
was
bound
by
his
position
particularly
as
the
clericals
would
certainly
secure
a
majority
in
the
municipal
council
at
the
next
elections
if
the
population
were
irritated
any
further
that
disastrous
simon
affair
had
given
the
church
a
wonderfully
favourable
battlefield
where
it
gained
the
easiest
victories
over
the
poor
ignorant
multitude
poisoned
with
errors
and
lies
as
long
as
that
blast
of
dementia
should
continue
blowing
one
could
attempt
nothing
one
must
bow
the
head
and
let
the
storm
sweep
on
darras
even
exacted
from
marc
a
promise
that
he
would
not
repeat
what
he
said
to
him
then
he
escorted
him
to
the
door
as
a
proof
of
his
secret
sympathy
and
again
implored
him
to
remain
silent
and
motionless
until
the
advent
of
better
times
when
marc
as
the
result
of
such
incidents
felt
overcome
with
despair
and
disgust
there
was
only
one
spot
where
he
found
any
comfort
that
was
the
private
room
of
salvan
the
director
of
the
beaumont
training
college
he
visited
salvan
frequently
during
the
trying
winter
months
when
his
colleague
férou
was
starving
at
le
moreux
and
contending
against
abbé
cognasse
he
spoke
to
his
friend
of
the
revolting
wretchedness
of
the
poor
schoolmaster
beside
the
prosperity
of
the
priest
and
salvan
admitted
that
such
wretchedness
was
the
cause
of
the
discredit
into
which
the
position
of
elementary
schoolmaster
was
fast
falling
if
students
for
the
training
colleges
were
only
recruited
with
difficulty
it
was
because
the
paltry
stipend
of
sous
a
day
allowed
a
man
when
he
became
a
titular
at
thirty
years
of
age
no
longer
tempted
anybody
the
peasants
sons
who
were
anxious
to
escape
the
plough
and
among
whom
both
the
training
colleges
and
the
seminaries
found
most
of
their
pupils
now
preferred
to
go
to
the
towns
in
search
of
fortune
to
engage
in
commerce
there
and
even
to
become
mere
clerks
it
was
only
exoneration
from
military
service
obtained
by
signing
a
contract
to
follow
the
teaching
profession
for
at
least
ten
years
that
still
induced
some
of
them
to
enter
that
calling
in
which
so
little
money
and
so
few
honours
were
to
be
won
whereas
a
deal
of
worry
and
a
deal
of
scorn
were
to
be
expected
by
all
yet
the
recruiting
of
the
training
colleges
was
the
great
question
on
which
the
education
of
the
country
its
very
strength
and
salvation
depended
with
it
in
importance
was
that
of
the
exact
training
to
be
given
in
those
colleges
to
the
schoolmasters
of
the
future
it
was
necessary
to
animate
them
with
the
flame
of
reason
and
logic
to
warm
their
hearts
with
the
love
of
truth
and
justice
the
recruiting
depended
entirely
on
the
grant
of
higher
remuneration
to
the
profession
such
reasonable
remuneration
as
would
enable
a
schoolmaster
to
lead
a
life
of
quiet
dignity
whilst
as
for
the
training
of
the
future
teachers
an
entirely
new
programme
was
needed
as
salvan
rightly
said
on
the
value
of
the
elementary
master
depended
the
value
of
elementary
education
the
mentality
of
the
poorer
classes
who
formed
the
immense
majority
of
the
community
and
beyond
that
matter
there
was
that
of
the
future
of
france
thus
the
question
became
one
of
life
or
death
for
the
nation
salvan
mission
was
to
prepare
masters
for
the
liberating
work
which
would
be
entrusted
to
them
but
hitherto
it
had
been
impossible
to
create
apostles
such
as
were
needed
men
who
based
themselves
solely
on
experimental
methods
who
rejected
dogmas
and
mendacious
legends
the
whole
huge
fabric
of
error
by
which
the
humble
of
the
world
have
been
held
in
misery
and
bondage
for
ages
the
existing
masters
were
mostly
worthy
folk
republicans
even
quite
capable
of
teaching
reading
writing
arithmetic
and
a
little
history
but
absolutely
incapable
of
forming
citizens
and
men
in
the
disastrous
simon
affair
they
had
been
seen
passing
almost
entirely
to
the
side
of
falsehood
because
they
lacked
reasoning
powers
method
and
logic
they
did
not
know
how
truth
ought
to
be
loved
it
had
sufficed
them
to
hear
that
the
jews
had
sold
france
to
germany
and
at
once
they
had
become
delirious
where
then
ah
where
was
that
sacred
battalion
of
elementary
schoolmasters
which
was
to
have
taught
the
whole
people
of
france
by
the
sole
light
of
certainties
scientifically
established
in
order
that
it
might
be
delivered
from
the
darkness
of
centuries
and
rendered
capable
at
last
of
practising
truth
and
liberty
and
justice
one
morning
marc
received
a
letter
in
which
salvan
begged
him
to
call
at
the
first
opportunity
on
the
following
thursday
afternoon
the
young
man
therefore
repaired
to
beaumont
to
that
training
college
which
he
could
never
enter
without
a
feeling
of
emotion
without
memories
and
hopes
arising
in
his
mind
the
director
was
awaiting
him
in
his
private
room
a
door
of
which
opened
into
a
little
garden
brightened
already
by
the
warm
april
sunshine
dear
friend
said
salvan
is
why
i
sent
for
you
you
are
acquainted
with
the
deplorable
state
of
affairs
at
maillebois
méchain
the
new
master
whose
appointment
in
such
grave
circumstances
was
a
mistake
is
not
badly
disposed
i
even
think
that
he
is
on
our
side
but
he
is
weak
and
in
a
few
months
time
he
has
allowed
himself
to
be
outflanked
moreover
he
is
ill
and
has
applied
for
a
change
of
appointment
wishing
if
possible
to
go
to
the
south
what
we
need
at
maillebois
is
a
master
of
sterling
good
sense
and
strong
will
one
possessed
of
all
the
intelligence
and
energy
necessitated
by
the
present
situation
and
so
there
have
been
thoughts
of
you
me
cried
marc
taken
aback
by
so
sudden
and
unexpected
an
announcement
you
alone
are
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
district
and
the
frightful
crisis
to
which
it
is
now
a
prey
since
the
condemnation
of
poor
simon
the
elementary
school
has
been
so
to
say
accursed
it
loses
pupils
every
month
while
the
brothers
school
tends
to
take
its
place
maillebois
is
now
becoming
a
centre
of
clericalism
low
superstition
and
reactionary
stupidity
which
will
end
by
devouring
everything
if
we
do
not
resist
the
population
is
already
relapsing
into
the
hateful
passions
the
foolish
imaginings
of
nine
hundred
years
ago
and
we
need
an
artisan
of
the
future
a
sower
of
the
good
crop
to
restore
the
communal
school
to
prosperity
so
as
i
said
before
you
were
thought
of
is
it
merely
a
personal
desire
that
you
are
expressing
or
have
you
been
asked
to
consult
me
asked
marc
again
interrupting
salvan
smiled
i
am
a
functionary
of
no
great
importance
i
can
hardly
hope
to
see
all
my
personal
desires
accomplished
the
truth
is
that
i
have
been
requested
to
sound
you
it
is
known
that
i
am
a
friend
of
yours
le
barazer
our
academy
inspector
sent
for
me
last
monday
and
from
our
conversation
sprang
the
idea
of
offering
you
the
maillebois
school
marc
could
not
refrain
from
shrugging
his
shoulders
le
barazer
did
not
behave
very
bravely
in
simon
case
i
am
aware
of
it
salvan
continued
might
have
done
something
but
we
have
to
take
men
as
they
are
one
thing
which
i
can
promise
you
is
that
if
you
do
not
find
him
exactly
on
your
side
hereafter
he
will
at
least
prove
the
hidden
prop
the
inert
substance
on
which
you
may
lean
for
support
without
fear
he
always
ends
by
getting
the
better
of
prefect
hennebise
who
is
so
dreadfully
afraid
of
worries
and
forbes
the
rector
good
man
is
content
to
reign
without
governing
the
dangerous
party
is
that
lay
jesuit
mauraisin
your
elementary
inspector
father
crabot
friend
with
whom
le
barazer
thinks
it
more
politic
to
behave
gently
but
come
surely
the
idea
of
battle
does
not
frighten
you
marc
remained
silent
with
downcast
eyes
absorbed
in
anxious
thoughts
assailed
by
doubt
and
hesitation
then
salvan
who
could
read
his
mind
and
who
moreover
was
acquainted
with
the
drama
of
his
home
life
stepped
forward
and
took
his
hands
saying
with
great
feeling
know
what
i
am
asking
of
you
my
friend
i
was
a
great
friend
of
berthereau
geneviève
father
a
man
with
a
very
free
broad
mind
but
at
the
same
time
a
sentimental
man
who
ended
by
accompanying
his
wife
to
mass
in
order
to
please
her
later
i
acted
as
to
his
daughter
your
wife
and
i
often
visited
the
little
house
on
the
place
des
capucins
where
madame
duparque
already
reigned
so
despotically
over
her
daughter
madame
berthereau
and
over
her
grandchild
geneviève
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
warned
you
more
than
i
did
at
the
time
of
your
marriage
for
there
is
always
some
danger
when
a
man
like
you
marries
a
young
girl
who
ever
since
infancy
has
been
steeped
in
the
most
idolatrous
of
religions
but
so
far
i
have
had
no
great
occasion
for
for
you
are
happy
nevertheless
it
is
quite
true
that
if
you
accept
the
maillebois
appointment
you
will
find
yourself
in
continual
conflict
with
those
ladies
that
is
what
you
are
thinking
of
is
it
not
marc
raised
his
head
i
confess
it
i
fear
for
my
happiness
as
you
know
i
have
no
ambition
to
be
appointed
at
maillebois
would
doubtless
be
desirable
advancement
but
i
am
perfectly
content
with
my
position
at
jonville
where
i
am
delighted
to
have
succeeded
and
to
have
rendered
some
services
to
our
cause
yet
now
you
wish
me
to
quit
that
certainty
and
jeopardise
my
peace
elsewhere
a
pause
followed
then
salvan
gently
asked
you
doubt
affection
no
cried
marc
and
after
another
pause
and
some
little
embarrassment
could
i
doubt
her
loving
as
she
is
so
happy
in
my
arms
but
you
can
have
no
notion
of
the
life
we
led
with
those
ladies
during
the
vacation
while
i
was
busy
with
simon
case
it
became
unbearable
i
was
treated
as
a
stranger
there
even
the
servant
would
not
speak
to
me
and
i
felt
as
if
i
had
been
carried
thousands
of
leagues
away
to
some
other
planet
with
whose
inhabitants
i
had
nothing
in
common
worst
of
all
the
ladies
began
to
spoil
my
geneviève
she
was
relapsing
into
the
ideas
of
her
convent
days
and
she
herself
ended
by
growing
frightened
and
felt
very
happy
when
we
found
ourselves
once
more
in
our
little
nest
at
jonville
he
paused
quivering
and
then
concluded
no
leave
me
where
i
am
i
do
my
duty
there
i
carry
out
a
work
which
i
regard
as
good
it
is
sufficient
for
each
workman
to
bring
his
stone
for
the
edifice
salvan
who
had
been
pacing
the
room
slowly
halted
in
front
of
the
young
man
do
not
wish
you
to
sacrifice
yourself
my
friend
he
said
should
regret
it
all
my
life
if
your
happiness
should
be
compromised
if
the
bitterness
born
of
conflict
should
infect
your
hearth
but
you
are
of
the
metal
out
of
which
heroes
are
wrought
do
not
give
me
an
answer
now
take
a
week
to
think
the
matter
over
come
again
next
thursday
we
will
then
have
another
chat
and
arrive
at
a
decision
marc
returned
to
jonville
that
evening
feeling
very
worried
ought
he
to
silence
his
fears
which
he
scarcely
dared
to
acknowledge
to
himself
and
engage
in
a
struggle
with
his
wife
relations
a
struggle
in
which
all
the
joy
of
his
life
might
be
annihilated
he
had
decided
at
first
that
he
would
have
a
frank
explanation
with
geneviève
but
afterwards
his
courage
failed
him
he
foresaw
only
too
well
that
she
would
simply
tell
him
to
act
in
accordance
with
his
opinions
and
as
his
duty
directed
thus
assailed
by
increasing
anguish
of
mind
discontented
with
himself
the
young
man
did
not
speak
to
his
wife
of
salvan
offer
two
days
went
by
amid
hesitation
and
doubt
and
then
he
ended
by
reviewing
the
situation
and
weighing
the
various
reasons
which
might
induce
him
to
accept
or
refuse
the
maillebois
appointment
he
pictured
the
little
town
there
was
darras
the
mayor
who
although
a
man
and
one
of
advanced
views
no
longer
dared
to
be
openly
just
for
fear
of
losing
his
official
position
and
placing
his
fortune
in
jeopardy
there
were
also
all
the
bongards
the
doloirs
the
savins
the
milhommes
all
those
folk
of
average
intellect
and
morality
who
had
favoured
him
with
such
strange
discourses
in
which
cruelty
was
blended
with
imbecility
while
behind
them
came
the
multitude
a
prey
to
even
more
ridiculous
fancies
and
capable
of
more
immediate
ferocity
the
superstitions
of
savages
prevailed
among
the
masses
their
mentality
was
that
of
a
nation
of
barbarians
adoring
fetiches
setting
its
glory
in
massacre
and
rapine
and
displaying
neither
a
shred
of
tolerance
nor
of
sense
nor
of
kindliness
but
why
did
they
remain
steeped
at
their
ease
as
it
were
in
all
the
dense
filth
of
error
and
falsehood
why
did
they
reject
logic
even
mere
reason
with
a
kind
of
instinctive
hatred
as
if
they
were
terrified
by
everything
that
was
pure
simple
and
clear
and
why
in
the
simon
case
had
they
given
to
the
world
the
extraordinary
and
deplorable
spectacle
of
a
people
paralysed
in
its
sensibility
and
intelligence
determined
neither
to
see
nor
to
understand
but
bent
on
enveloping
itself
in
all
possible
darkness
in
order
that
it
might
be
unable
to
see
and
free
to
clamour
for
death
amid
the
black
night
of
its
superstitions
and
its
prejudices
those
folk
had
assuredly
been
contaminated
poisoned
day
by
day
newspapers
like
petit
and
croix
de
had
poured
forth
the
hateful
beverage
which
corrupts
and
brings
delirium
poor
childish
minds
hearts
deficient
in
courage
all
the
suffering
and
humble
ones
brutified
by
bondage
and
misery
become
an
easy
prey
for
forgers
and
liars
for
those
who
batten
upon
public
credulity
and
ever
since
the
beginning
of
time
every
church
and
empire
and
monarchy
in
the
world
has
only
reigned
over
the
multitude
by
poisoning
it
after
robbing
and
maintaining
it
in
the
terror
and
slavery
of
false
beliefs
but
if
the
people
had
been
poisoned
so
easily
it
must
have
been
because
it
possessed
no
power
of
resistance
poison
moral
poison
acts
particularly
on
the
ignorant
on
those
who
know
nothing
those
who
are
incapable
of
criticising
examining
and
reasoning
thus
beneath
all
the
anguish
iniquity
and
shame
one
found
ignorance
ignorance
the
first
and
the
only
cause
of
mankind
long
calvary
its
slow
and
laborious
ascent
towards
the
light
through
all
the
filth
and
the
crimes
of
history
and
assuredly
if
nations
were
to
be
freed
one
must
go
to
the
root
of
things
that
root
of
ignorance
for
once
again
it
had
been
demonstrated
that
an
ignorant
people
could
not
practise
equity
that
truth
alone
could
endow
it
with
the
power
of
dispensing
justice
at
that
point
of
his
reflections
marc
felt
very
much
astonished
how
came
it
that
the
mentality
of
the
masses
was
no
higher
than
that
of
mere
savages
had
not
the
republic
reigned
for
thirty
years
and
had
not
its
founders
shown
themselves
conscious
of
the
necessities
of
the
times
by
basing
the
state
edifice
on
scholastic
laws
restoring
the
elementary
schools
to
honour
and
strength
and
decreeing
that
education
thenceforth
should
be
gratuitous
compulsory
and
secular
they
must
have
fancied
at
that
time
that
the
good
work
was
virtually
done
that
a
real
democracy
delivered
from
errors
and
falsehoods
would
at
last
sprout
from
the
soil
of
france
but
thirty
years
had
elapsed
and
any
forward
step
that
might
be
achieved
seemed
to
be
cancelled
by
the
slightest
public
disturbance
the
people
of
relapsed
into
the
brutish
degradation
the
dementia
of
the
people
of
yesterday
amidst
a
sudden
return
of
ancestral
darkness
what
had
happened
then
what
covert
resistance
what
subterranean
force
was
it
that
had
thus
paralysed
the
immense
efforts
which
had
been
attempted
to
extricate
all
the
humble
and
suffering
ones
from
their
slavery
and
obscurity
as
marc
put
this
question
to
himself
he
at
once
saw
the
enemy
arise
the
enemy
the
creator
of
ignorance
and
death
the
roman
catholic
church
it
was
that
church
which
with
the
patient
tactics
of
a
tenacious
worker
had
barred
the
roads
and
gradually
seized
on
all
those
poor
dense
minds
which
others
had
tried
to
wrest
from
its
domination
she
had
always
fully
understood
that
she
must
remain
the
master
of
the
educational
system
in
order
that
she
might
create
night
and
falsehood
as
she
listed
if
she
desired
to
keep
the
bodies
and
souls
of
the
masses
in
subjection
thus
it
was
on
the
battlefield
of
the
schools
that
she
had
once
again
waged
hostilities
displaying
marvellous
suppleness
in
her
hypocritical
craft
pretending
even
to
be
republican
and
availing
herself
of
the
laws
of
freedom
to
keep
within
the
prison
house
of
her
dogmas
and
superstitions
the
millions
of
children
whom
those
same
laws
had
been
devised
to
liberate
and
all
those
children
were
young
brains
won
over
to
error
future
soldiers
for
the
religion
of
spoliation
and
cruelty
which
reigned
over
the
hateful
society
of
the
era
the
crafty
old
pope
was
seen
leading
the
campaign
that
turning
movement
which
was
to
drive
the
revolution
from
its
own
land
of
france
and
in
the
name
of
liberty
filch
and
appropriate
all
its
conquests
the
founders
of
the
existing
the
early
republicans
in
presence
of
the
feigned
disarming
of
the
church
had
been
enough
to
regard
themselves
as
victors
to
lapse
into
tranquillity
and
even
to
smile
upon
the
priests
they
celebrated
a
new
spirit
of
concord
and
pacification
the
union
of
all
beliefs
in
one
sole
national
and
patriotic
faith
as
the
republic
was
triumphant
why
should
it
not
welcome
all
its
children
even
those
who
again
and
again
had
tried
to
throttle
it
but
thanks
to
that
benevolent
grandeur
of
views
the
church
went
on
prosecuting
her
subterranean
march
the
congregations
which
had
been
expelled
came
back
one
by
one
the
everlasting
work
of
invasion
and
enthralment
was
pursued
without
an
hour
rest
little
by
little
the
colleges
of
the
jesuits
the
dominicans
and
other
congregations
peopled
the
civil
service
the
magistrature
and
the
army
with
their
pupils
and
creatures
while
the
secular
schools
were
dispossessed
by
those
of
the
brothers
and
sisters
thus
on
suddenly
awaking
with
a
great
start
the
country
had
found
itself
once
more
in
the
hands
of
the
church
the
best
posts
of
its
governmental
organisation
being
held
by
the
church
men
while
its
future
was
pledged
since
the
children
of
the
masses
the
peasants
artisans
and
soldiers
of
were
held
beneath
the
rods
of
the
ignorantines
footnote
this
is
not
an
allusion
to
the
recent
expulsions
of
the
religious
orders
but
to
those
carried
out
a
score
of
years
marc
as
it
happened
witnessed
on
the
sunday
an
extraordinary
spectacle
which
fully
confirmed
his
impressions
he
was
still
deep
in
thought
still
unable
to
make
up
his
mind
to
accept
salvan
offer
and
having
gone
to
maillebois
that
sunday
in
order
to
see
david
he
afterwards
came
upon
a
remarkable
religious
ceremony
which
croix
de
and
petit
had
been
announcing
in
flamboyant
articles
for
a
fortnight
past
in
such
wise
that
all
the
devotees
of
the
region
were
in
a
fever
of
excitement
over
it
the
question
was
one
of
a
superb
reliquary
containing
a
fragment
of
the
skull
of
antony
of
padua
a
perfect
treasure
for
the
purchase
of
which
as
much
as
ten
thousand
francs
it
was
said
had
been
subscribed
by
some
of
the
faithful
who
had
presented
it
to
the
capuchin
chapel
for
the
inauguration
of
the
reliquary
at
the
feet
of
the
statue
of
the
saint
there
was
to
be
a
grand
solemnity
which
monseigneur
begerot
had
consented
to
adorn
with
his
presence
it
was
the
bishop
graciousness
in
this
respect
which
impassioned
everybody
for
none
had
forgotten
how
he
had
formerly
supported
abbé
quandieu
the
parish
priest
against
the
efforts
of
the
capuchins
to
gain
all
the
faithful
and
all
the
money
of
the
region
to
themselves
besides
he
had
always
been
regarded
as
a
thorough
simonist
yet
he
had
now
consented
to
bestow
on
the
capuchins
and
their
trade
a
public
mark
of
his
sympathy
and
it
followed
that
he
must
have
submitted
to
very
powerful
influences
for
it
was
extraordinary
that
after
an
interval
of
only
a
few
months
he
should
give
the
lie
to
all
his
previous
actions
and
resign
himself
to
a
course
which
must
have
been
painful
indeed
to
a
man
of
so
much
culture
and
gentle
good
sense
attracted
by
curiosity
marc
repaired
with
the
crowd
to
the
chapel
where
during
the
next
two
hours
he
beheld
the
strangest
things
possible
the
trade
which
the
maillebois
capuchins
carried
on
with
their
antony
of
padua
had
become
very
considerable
amounting
to
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
francs
every
year
collected
in
little
sums
varying
from
one
franc
to
ten
father
théodose
the
superior
whose
fine
apostolic
head
sent
all
the
lady
devotees
into
raptures
had
proved
himself
to
be
an
inventor
and
manager
of
great
genius
he
had
devised
and
organised
the
democratic
miracle
the
domestic
miracle
such
as
was
within
the
reach
of
the
humblest
purses
at
the
outset
antony
statue
in
the
chapel
had
been
a
somewhat
paltry
one
and
the
saint
had
busied
himself
with
little
else
than
the
finding
of
lost
things
his
specialty
but
after
a
few
successes
of
this
kind
as
money
began
to
flow
in
father
théodose
by
a
stroke
of
genius
extended
the
sphere
of
the
saint
miraculous
action
applying
it
to
all
the
needs
and
desires
of
his
steadily
increasing
customers
the
sick
who
were
afflicted
with
incurable
maladies
those
also
who
merely
suffered
from
head
or
stomach
ache
the
petty
shopkeepers
who
were
in
embarrassed
circumstances
who
lacked
the
money
to
honour
their
acceptances
or
who
did
not
know
how
to
get
rid
of
damaged
goods
the
speculators
who
had
embarked
in
shady
undertakings
and
who
feared
the
loss
of
their
fortunes
and
their
liberty
the
mothers
who
were
in
despair
at
finding
no
husbands
for
their
plain
and
dowerless
daughters
the
poor
devils
out
of
work
who
were
weary
of
seeking
employment
and
who
felt
that
only
a
prodigy
could
enable
them
to
earn
their
bread
the
heirs
who
were
anxious
with
respect
to
the
sentiments
of
an
ailing
grandparent
and
who
desired
the
help
of
heaven
to
ensure
them
a
bequest
the
idle
schoolboys
the
school
girls
all
the
dunces
who
were
certain
to
fail
at
their
examinations
if
providence
did
not
come
to
their
assistance
all
the
sorry
weaklings
destitute
of
will
incapable
of
effort
who
regardless
of
work
and
common
sense
awaited
some
undeserved
success
from
a
superior
power
all
these
might
address
themselves
to
antony
confide
their
case
to
him
and
secure
his
intercession
with
the
deity
the
chances
of
success
in
their
favour
being
six
to
four
according
to
careful
statistics
which
had
been
prepared
so
everything
was
organised
in
a
lavish
way
the
old
statue
was
replaced
by
a
new
one
very
much
larger
and
gilded
far
more
profusely
and
collection
boxes
were
set
up
on
all
sides
collection
boxes
of
a
new
pattern
each
having
two
compartments
one
for
money
gifts
and
the
other
for
letters
which
were
addressed
to
the
saint
and
which
specified
the
nature
of
the
applications
it
was
of
course
allowable
to
give
no
money
but
it
was
remarked
that
the
saint
granted
only
the
prayers
of
those
who
bestowed
at
least
some
small
alms
in
the
result
a
tariff
was
established
based
on
experience
so
father
théodose
asserted
one
franc
and
two
francs
given
being
for
little
favours
five
francs
and
ten
francs
when
one
was
more
ambitiously
inclined
besides
if
the
applicant
did
not
give
enough
the
saint
soon
made
it
known
by
failing
to
intervene
and
it
then
became
necessary
to
double
and
treble
one
alms
those
customers
who
desired
to
delay
payment
until
the
miracle
was
accomplished
ran
the
risk
of
never
securing
a
favour
at
all
moreover
the
saint
retained
all
freedom
of
action
choosing
the
elect
as
he
pleased
and
rendering
accounts
to
none
thus
the
whole
affair
was
a
gamble
a
kind
of
divine
lottery
in
which
one
might
draw
a
good
or
a
bad
number
and
it
was
this
very
circumstance
which
impassioned
the
masses
among
whom
the
gambling
instinct
is
so
keen
they
rushed
upon
the
collection
boxes
and
gave
their
franc
their
two
francs
or
their
five
francs
all
aflame
with
the
hope
that
they
would
perhaps
secure
a
big
prize
some
illicit
and
gain
some
fine
marriage
some
diploma
some
huge
bequest
never
had
there
been
a
more
impudent
attempt
to
brutify
the
public
a
more
shameless
speculation
on
human
stupidity
and
the
instincts
of
idleness
and
covetousness
one
which
destroyed
all
and
spread
broadcast
the
idea
of
achieving
success
by
chance
alone
without
the
slightest
show
of
merit
footnote
zola
account
of
the
worship
of
antony
is
strictly
accurate
can
one
wonder
that
the
government
of
the
republic
should
have
decided
to
expel
from
france
some
of
the
bandits
who
masquerading
under
the
guise
of
monks
initiated
this
colossal
fraud
the
idea
of
it
sprang
from
their
keen
jealousy
of
the
wealth
of
the
assumptionist
fathers
whom
they
found
raking
in
money
at
lourdes
by
the
aid
of
bogus
miracles
they
carried
the
miracle
craze
further
by
diffusing
the
worship
of
antony
throughout
france
preying
on
all
the
credulous
with
the
most
astounding
marc
understood
by
the
feverish
enthusiasm
of
the
groups
around
him
that
the
business
would
spread
still
further
and
contaminate
the
whole
region
thanks
to
that
chiselled
gilded
silver
reliquary
in
which
a
fragment
of
antony
skull
was
enshrined
this
was
father
théodose
last
device
in
response
to
the
competition
which
other
religious
orders
had
started
at
beaumont
with
a
great
swarming
of
statues
and
collection
boxes
in
order
that
the
public
might
try
their
luck
with
other
saints
mistakes
would
now
be
impossible
he
alone
possessed
the
sacred
fragment
of
bone
and
he
alone
would
be
able
to
supply
the
miracle
gamblers
with
the
very
best
chances
of
success
posters
covered
the
walls
of
the
chapel
a
new
prospectus
guaranteed
the
absolute
authenticity
of
the
relic
set
forth
that
the
tariffs
would
not
be
increased
in
spite
of
the
new
advantages
offered
and
carefully
regulated
operations
in
order
that
no
recrimination
might
ensue
between
the
saint
and
his
customers
the
first
thing
however
which
struck
marc
painfully
was
the
presence
of
mademoiselle
rouzaire
who
had
brought
the
girls
of
the
communal
school
to
the
ceremony
as
if
their
attendance
were
a
part
of
the
curriculum
and
he
was
stupefied
when
at
the
head
of
the
girls
he
saw
the
tallest
of
them
carrying
a
religious
banner
of
white
silk
embroidered
with
gold
but
mademoiselle
rouzaire
made
no
secret
of
her
sentiments
whenever
one
of
her
pupils
competed
for
a
certificate
she
sent
her
not
only
to
take
communion
but
to
place
two
francs
in
one
of
antony
collection
boxes
in
order
that
the
deity
might
facilitate
her
examination
when
the
pupil
was
more
stupid
than
usual
she
even
advised
her
to
put
five
francs
into
the
box
as
the
saint
would
assuredly
have
extra
trouble
in
her
case
she
also
made
her
pupils
keep
diaries
in
which
they
had
to
record
their
sins
day
by
day
and
distributed
good
marks
to
them
for
attendance
at
mass
singular
indeed
was
the
secular
communal
school
kept
by
mademoiselle
rouzaire
the
little
girls
ranged
themselves
on
the
left
side
of
the
nave
while
the
little
boys
of
the
brothers
school
installed
themselves
on
the
right
in
the
charge
of
brother
fulgence
who
as
usual
made
no
end
of
fuss
father
crabot
and
father
philibin
who
had
wished
to
honour
the
ceremony
with
their
presence
were
already
in
the
choir
perhaps
they
were
further
desirous
of
enjoying
their
victory
over
monseigneur
bergerot
for
everybody
knew
how
the
rector
of
valmarie
had
helped
to
glorify
the
worship
of
antony
of
padua
in
such
wise
that
it
was
a
triumph
to
have
compelled
the
bishop
to
make
due
amends
for
his
severity
of
language
respecting
superstition
when
monseigneur
bergerot
entered
the
chapel
followed
by
abbé
quandieu
marc
felt
confused
almost
ashamed
for
them
such
dolorous
submission
such
enforced
relinquishment
did
he
detect
beneath
their
grave
pale
countenances
the
young
man
easily
guessed
what
had
happened
how
the
dementia
the
irresistible
onrush
of
the
devout
had
ended
by
sweeping
the
bishop
and
the
priest
from
the
positions
they
had
originally
taken
up
abbé
quandieu
had
long
resisted
unwilling
as
he
was
to
lend
himself
to
what
he
regarded
as
idolatry
but
at
sight
of
the
scandal
occasioned
by
his
demeanour
and
the
solitude
growing
around
him
he
had
been
seized
with
anguish
wondering
if
religion
would
not
suffer
from
his
uncompromising
attitude
and
at
last
resigning
himself
to
the
painful
duty
of
casting
the
holy
mantle
of
his
ministry
over
the
new
and
pestilential
sore
one
day
he
had
carried
the
story
of
his
doubts
his
struggles
his
defeat
to
monseigneur
bergerot
who
like
him
was
vanquished
who
like
him
feared
some
diminution
of
the
power
of
the
church
if
it
should
confess
its
follies
and
its
flaws
and
the
weeping
bishop
had
embraced
the
priest
and
promised
to
attend
the
ceremony
which
was
to
seal
the
reconciliation
with
the
capuchins
and
their
allies
keen
suffering
must
have
come
to
them
from
their
powerlessness
from
their
enforced
cowardice
and
they
must
have
suffered
yet
more
bitterly
at
seeing
their
ideal
soiled
their
faith
made
a
mere
matter
of
barter
ah
that
christianity
so
pure
at
its
advent
a
great
cause
of
brotherhood
and
deliverance
and
even
that
catholicism
which
had
winged
its
flight
so
boldly
and
proved
itself
so
powerful
an
instrument
of
civilisation
in
what
mud
would
both
expire
if
they
must
be
thus
allowed
to
sink
to
the
vilest
trading
to
become
the
prey
of
the
basest
passions
mere
things
to
be
bought
and
sold
instruments
for
the
diffusion
of
brutishness
and
falsehood
worms
were
gathering
in
them
as
in
all
old
things
and
soon
would
come
rottenness
final
decomposition
which
would
leave
nought
save
a
little
dust
and
mouldiness
behind
the
ceremony
proved
a
triumphal
one
a
constellation
of
candles
glittered
around
the
reliquary
which
was
blessed
and
censed
there
were
orisons
and
addresses
and
canticles
chanted
amid
the
mighty
strains
of
the
organ
several
ladies
were
taken
ill
one
of
mademoiselle
rouzaire
little
girls
had
to
be
led
away
so
oppressive
became
the
atmosphere
but
the
delirium
of
the
congregation
reached
a
climax
when

théodose
having
ascended
the

recited
the

convulsed
the

at

fresh
announcement
of

till
at
last
a
clamour
of
satisfied
passion
greeted
the
enumeration
of
each
favour
which
father
théodose
announced
from
the
pulpit
in
a
thundering
voice
it
all
ended
in
an
attack
of
veritable
dementia
the
whole
congregation
rising
and
howling
stretching
forth
convulsive
hands
as
if
to
catch
one
or
another
of
those
great
lottery
prizes
that
rained
down
from
heaven
angered
and
disgusted
marc
was
unable
to
remain
there
any
longer
he
had
seen
father
crabot
await
a
benevolent
smile
from
monseigneur
bergerot
then
hold
with
him
a
friendly
conversation
which
everybody
remarked
meantime
abbé
quandieu
was
smiling
also
though
a
twitch
of
pain
lurked
round
his
lips
the
sacrifice
was
consummated
the
victory
of
the
brothers
and
the
monks
the
triumph
of
the
catholicism
of
idolatry
servitude
and
annihilation
would
prove
complete
the
young
man
felt
stifled
in
that
atmosphere
so
he
left
the
chapel
to
seek
the
sunshine
and
the
pure
air
but
antony
of
padua
pursued
him
even
across
the
square
outside
groups
of
female
devotees
were
chattering
together
even
as
the
women
gamblers
had
chattered
in
the
old
days
while
loitering
near
the
doors
of
the
lottery
offices
for
me
said
one
very
fat
and
doleful
woman
never
have
any
luck
i
never
win
at
any
game
and
perhaps
that
why
antony
does
not
listen
to
me
i
gave
forty
sous
on
three
occasions
once
for
my
goat
which
was
ailing
but
all
the
same
it
died
the
next
time
for
a
ring
i
lost
and
which
i
never
found
and
then
the
third
time
for
some
potatoes
which
were
rotting
but
it
was
no
good
i
could
find
a
buyer
for
them
ah
i
am
really
unlucky
and
no
mistake
are
too
patient
my
dear
a
little
dark
wizened
old
woman
answered
for
me
when
antony
wo
lend
ear
i
make
him
listen
how
my
dear
i
punish
him
for
instance
there
was
that
little
house
of
mine
which
i
could
let
because
people
complain
that
it
too
damp
and
that
children
get
ill
and
die
there
well
i
gave
three
francs
and
then
i
waited
nothing
not
a
sign
of
a
tenant
i
gave
three
francs
a
second
time
and
still
there
was
no
result
that
made
me
cross
and
i
hustled
the
statuette
of
the
saint
which
stands
on
the
chest
of
drawers
in
my
bedroom
as
he
still
did
nothing
for
me
i
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
to
let
him
reflect
he
spent
a
week
like
that
but
still
nothing
came
of
it
for
it
did
not
humiliate
him
sufficiently
i
had
to
think
of
something
else
i
felt
quite
furious
and
i
ended
by
tying
him
to
a
cord
and
lowering
him
into
my
well
head
downwards
ah
my
dear
he
then
understood
that
i
was
bound
to
have
the
last
word
with
him
for
he
had
been
in
the
well
two
hours
when
some
people
called
and
i
let
them
my
little
house
you
pulled
him
out
of
the
well
at
once
i
set
him
on
the
drawers
again
after
wiping
him
quite
clean
and
apologising
to
him
we
are
not
on
bad
terms
together
on
account
of
that
affair
oh
dear
no
only
do
you
see
when
one
has
paid
one
money
one
ought
to
be
energetic
right
my
dear
i
try
i
have
some
worries
with
the
justice
of
the
peace
so
i
will
go
inside
and
give
two
francs
and
if
the
saint
does
help
me
to
win
the
suit
i
will
show
him
my
displeasure
it
my
dear
tie
a
stone
to
his
neck
or
wrap
him
up
in
some
dirty
linen
he
does
like
that
at
all
it
will
make
him
do
the
right
thing
marc
could
not
help
smiling
in
spite
of
his
bitter
feelings
he
continued
listening
and
heard
a
group
of
serious
looking
men
among
whom
he
recognised
philis
the
municipal
councillor
and
clerical
rival
of
mayor
darras
deploring
the
fact
that
not
a
parish
of
the
had
yet
consecrated
itself
to
the
sacred
heart
of
jesus
that
was
another
clever
invention
more
dangerous
still
than
the
base
trafficking
in
antony
of
padua
true
the
poorer
classes
as
yet
remained
indifferent
to
it
as
it
lacked
the
attraction
of
a
miraculous
and
a
gambling
element
none
the
less
there
was
a
grave
peril
in
that
idolatrous
worship
of
the
sacred
heart
a
real
red
bleeding
heart
torn
away
amid
a
last
palpitation
and
portrayed
like
the
heart
of
some
animal
in
a
butcher
shop
the
endeavour
was
to
make
that
gory
picture
the
emblem
of
modern
france
to
print
it
in
purple
to
embroider
it
in
silk
and
gold
on
the
national
flag
so
that
the
whole
country
might
become
a
mere
dependency
of
the
church
which
invented
that
repulsive
fetich
worship
here
again
one
found
the
same
manœuvre
the
same
attempt
to
lay
the
grip
of
priestcraft
on
the
nation
to
win
over
the
multitude
by
means
of
superstition
and
legend
in
the
hope
of
steeping
it
once
more
in
ignorance
and
bondage
and
in
the
case
of
the
sacred
heart
as
in
that
of
antony
of
padua
it
was
particularly
the
jesuits
who
were
at
work
disorganising
the
olden
catholicism
with
their
evil
power
and
reducing
religion
to
a
level
with
the
carnal
practices
of
savage
tribes
marc
hurried
away
he
again
felt
suffocated
he
longed
for
solitude
and
space
geneviève
desirous
of
spending
an
afternoon
with
her
parents
had
accompanied
him
to
maillebois
that
sunday
madame
duparque
being
attacked
by
gout
was
confined
to
her
and
had
been
prevented
therefore
from
attending
the
ceremony
at
the
chapel
as
marc
no
longer
visited
his
wife
relations
he
had
agreed
with
geneviève
that
he
would
meet
her
outside
the
railway
station
in
time
for
the
four
train
it
was
now
scarcely
more
than
three
and
so
he
walked
mechanically
to
the
square
where
the
railway
station
stood
and
sank
upon
a
bench
there
amid
the
solitude
he
was
still
pondering
still
absorbed
in
a
great
decisive
mental
battle
all
at
once
light
flashed
upon
his
mind
the
extraordinary
spectacle
he
had
just
beheld
the
things
he
had
seen
and
heard
filled
him
with
glowing
certainty
if
the
nation
were
passing
through
such
a
frightful
crisis
if
it
were
becoming
divided
into
two
hostile
frances
ready
to
devour
one
another
it
was
simply
because
rome
had
carried
her
battle
into
french
territory
france
was
the
last
great
roman
catholic
power
that
remained
she
alone
still
possessed
the
men
and
the
money
the
strength
needed
to
impose
roman
catholicism
on
the
world
it
was
logical
therefore
that
her
territory
should
have
been
chosen
for
the
supreme
battle
of
rome
who
was
so
frantically
desirous
of
recovering
her
temporal
power
as
that
alone
could
lead
her
to
the
realisation
of
her
ancient
dream
of
universal
domination
thus
all
france
had
become
like
those
frontier
plains
those
fertile
ploughlands
vineyards
and
orchards
where
two
armies
meet
and
contend
to
decide
some
mighty
quarrel
the
crops
are
ravaged
by
cavalry
charges
the
vineyards
and
orchards
are
ripped
open
by
galloping
batteries
of
artillery
shells
blow
up
the
villages
cuts
down
the
trees
and
changes
the
plain
into
a
lifeless
desert
and
in
like
way
the
france
of
is
devastated
and
ruined
by
the
warfare
which
the
church
there
wages
against
the
revolution
an
exterminating
warfare
without
truce
or
mercy
for
the
church
well
understands
that
if
she
does
not
slay
the
revolution
by
which
is
symbolised
the
spirit
of
liberty
and
justice
the
revolution
will
slay
her
thence
comes
the
desperate
struggle
on
every
field
among
every
class
a
struggle
poisoning
every
question
that
arises
fomenting
civil
war
transforming
the
motherland
into
a
field
of
massacre
where
perhaps
only
ruins
will
soon
remain
and
therein
lies
the
mortal
danger
a
certainty
of
death
if
the
church
should
triumph
and
cast
france
once
more
into
the
darkness
and
wretchedness
of
the
past
making
of
her
also
one
of
those
fallen
nations
which
expire
in
the
misery
and
nothingness
with
which
roman
catholicism
has
stricken

the

almost
reverted
to

instead
of

towards

it
was
more
particularly
because
the
jesuits
and
the
other
teaching
orders
had
set
their
grip
on
the

trebling
the
number
of
their
pupils
in
thirty

spreading
their

strive
to
make
them
free
citizens
to
win
back
those
masses
whom
he
saw
weighed
down
by
ignorance
and
falsehood
incapable
of
justice
he
would
go
to
the
children
and
to
the
children
instruct
them
and
little
by
little
create
a
people
of
truth
who
then
alone
would
become
a
people
of
justice
that
was
the
loftiest
duty
the
most
pressing
good
work
that
on
which
depended
the
country
very
salvation
its
strength
and
glory
in
its
liberating
and
mission
through
the
ages
and
through
the
other
nations
and
if
after
three
days
hesitation
and
anguish
at
the
idea
of
imperilling
the
happiness
he
enjoyed
in
geneviève
arms
a
moment
had
sufficed
for
marc
to
arrive
at
that
weighty
decision
was
it
not
that
he
had
also
found
himself
confronted
by
the
serious
problem
of
the
position
of
woman
whom
the
church
had
turned
into
a
mere
stupefied
serf
an
instrument
of
falsity
and
destruction
what
would
they
become
as
wives
and
mothers
those
little
girls
whom
mademoiselle
rouzaire
now
led
to
the
capuchins
when
the
church
had
seized
them
and
held
them
by
their
senses
their
weakness
and
their
sufferings
it
would
never
release
them
it
would
employ
them
as
terrible
engines
of
warfare
to
demolish
men
and
pervert
children
so
long
as
woman
in
her
ancient
contest
with
man
with
respect
to
unjust
laws
and
iniquitous
moral
customs
should
thus
remain
the
property
and
the
weapon
of
the
church
social
happiness
would
remain
impossible
war
would
be
perpetuated
between
the
disunited
sexes
and
woman
would
only
at
last
be
a
free
creature
a
free
companion
for
man
disposing
of
herself
and
of
her
happiness
for
the
happiness
of
her
husband
and
her
child
on
the
day
when
she
should
cease
to
belong
to
the
priest
her
present
master
he
who
disorganised
and
corrupted
her
with
respect
to
marc
himself
was
it
not
an
unacknowledged
fear
the
dread
of
some
drama
which
might
ravage
his
own
household
that
had
made
him
tremble
and
recoil
from
the
prospect
of
doing
his
duty
the
sudden
decision
he
had
taken
might
mean
a
struggle
at
his
own
hearth
the
necessity
of
doing
his
duty
to
those
of
his
own
home
even
though
his
heart
might
bleed
cruelly
the
while
he
knew
that
now
thus
there
was
some
heroism
in
the
course
he
chose
with
all
simplicity
with
all
enthusiasm
for
the
good
work
which
he
hoped
to
prosecute
the
highest
and
the
noblest
in
a
nascent
democracy
is
that
of
the
poor
and
scorned
elementary
schoolmaster
appointed
to
teach
the
humble
to
train
them
to
be
happy
citizens
the
builders
of
the
future
city
of
justice
and
peace
marc
felt
it
was
so
and
he
suddenly
realised
the
exact
sense
of
his
mission
his
apostleship
of
truth
that
fervent
passion
to
acquire
truth
certain
and
positive
then
cry
it
aloud
and
teach
it
to
all
which
had
ever
possessed
him
raising
his
eyes
to
the
railway
station
the
young
man
suddenly
perceived
that
it
was
past
four
the
train
which
he
and
his
wife
were
to
have
taken
had
gone
and
it
would
be
necessary
to
wait
till
six
when
the
next
one
started
almost
immediately
afterwards
he
saw
geneviève
approaching
looking
much
distressed
and
carrying
little
louise
in
her
arms
in
order
to
get
over
the
ground
more
rapidly
my
friend
you
must
forgive
me
i
quite
forgot
the
time
she
exclaimed
detained
me
and
seemed
so
annoyed
by
my
impatience
to
join
you
that
i
ended
by
no
longer
noticing
how
time
slipped
by
she
had
seated
herself
on
the
bench
beside
him
with
louise
on
her
lap
he
smilingly
inclined
his
head
and
kissed
the
child
who
had
raised
her
little
hands
to
pull
his
beard
and
he
quietly
answered
we
will
wait
till
six
my
dear
there
is
nobody
to
interfere
with
us
we
can
remain
here
besides
i
have
something
to
tell
you
but
louise
wanted
to
play
and
stamping
on
her
father
thighs
she
cast
her
arms
about
his
neck
she
been
good
he
asked
she
always
is
at
grandmother
she
afraid
of
being
scolded
but
now
you
see
she
wants
to
have
her
revenge
when
the
young
woman
had
managed
to
reseat
the
child
on
her
lap
again
she
inquired
of
her
husband
is
it
you
want
to
tell
me
which
i
did
not
previously
speak
to
you
about
as
i
had
not
made
up
my
mind
i
am
offered
the
post
of
schoolmaster
here
at
maillebois
and
i
am
going
to
accept
it
what
do
you
think
of
it
she
looked
at
him
in
amazement
at
first
unable
to
reply
and
for
a
moment
in
her
eyes
he
plainly
detected
a
gleam
of
joyous
surprise
followed
however
by
increasing
anxiety
what
do
you
think
of
it
he
repeated
think
my
friend
that
it
is
advancement
such
as
you
did
not
expect
so
soon
only
the
position
will
not
be
an
easy
one
here
amid
such
exasperated
passions
your
opinions
too
being
known
to
everybody
doubt
i
thought
of
that
but
it
would
be
cowardly
to
refuse
the
fight
to
speak
quite
plainly
my
friend
i
very
much
fear
that
if
you
accept
the
post
it
will
lead
to
a
complete
rupture
with
grandmother
with
mother
we
might
still
get
on
but
as
you
know
grandmother
is
intractable
she
will
imagine
that
you
have
come
here
to
do
the
work
of
antichrist
it
means
certain
rupture
a
pause
full
of
embarrassment
followed
then
marc
resumed
you
advise
me
to
refuse
you
also
would
disapprove
of
it
you
would
not
be
pleased
if
i
came
here
she
again
raised
her
eyes
to
his
and
with
an
impulse
of
great
sincerity
replied
of
what
you
do
you
grieve
me
my
friend
why
do
you
say
that
act
as
your
conscience
bids
do
your
duty
as
you
understand
it
you
are
the
only
good
judge
and
whatever
you
do
will
be
well
done
but
though
she
spoke
those
words
he
could
detect
that
her
voice
was
trembling
as
if
with
fear
of
some
unconfessed
peril
which
she
felt
to
be
near
at
hand
there
came
a
fresh
pause
during
which
her
husband
took
hold
of
her
hands
and
caressed
them
lovingly
in
order
to
reassure
her
you
have
quite
made
up
your
mind
she
asked
quite
i
feel
that
i
should
be
acting
wrongly
if
i
acted
otherwise
as
we
still
have
an
hour
and
a
half
to
wait
for
our
train
i
think
we
ought
to
return
to
grandmother
at
once
to
acquaint
her
with
your
decision
i
want
you
to
behave
frankly
with
her
not
as
if
you
were
hiding
things
the
young
woman
was
still
looking
at
her
husband
and
at
that
moment
all
that
he
read
in
her
glance
was
a
great
deal
of
loyalty
mingled
with
a
little
sadness
are
right
my
darling
he
answered
us
go
to
at
once
they
walked
slowly
towards
the
place
des
capucins
delayed
somewhat
by
the
little
legs
of
louise
whom
her
mother
held
by
the
hand
but
the
close
of
that
fine
april
day
was
delightful
and
they
covered
the
short
distance
in
a
kind
of
reverie
without
exchanging
a
word
the
square
had
become
deserted
again
the
ladies
house
seemed
to
be
wrapped
in
its
wonted
somnolence
they
found
madame
duparque
seated
in
the
little
resting
her
ailing
leg
on
a
chair
while
she
knitted
stockings
for
some
charity
madame
berthereau
was
embroidering
near
the
window
greatly
astonished
by
geneviève
return
and
particularly
by
the
presence
of
marc
the
grandmother
dropped
her
knitting
and
without
even
telling
them
to
sit
down
waited
for
them
to
speak
when
marc
had
acquainted
her
with
the
position
the
offer
made
to
him
his
decision
to
accept
it
and
his
desire
to
inform
her
of
it
in
a
deferential
way
she
gave
a
sudden
start
then
shrugged
her
shoulders
it
is
madness
my
boy
said
she
wo
keep
the
appointment
a
month
not
because
you
are
not
the
schoolmaster
we
require
you
are
well
aware
of
the
good
spirit
of
the
district
where
religion
is
securing
such
splendid
triumphs
and
with
your
revolutionary
ideas
your
position
would
be
untenable
you
would
soon
be
at
war
with
the
whole
population
i
should
be
at
war
unfortunately
one
has
to
fight
in
order
to
be
victorious
thereupon
the
old
lady
became
angry
speak
foolishly
she
exclaimed
seems
to
be
no
end
to
your
pride
and
rebellion
against
religion
but
you
are
only
a
grain
of
sand
my
poor
boy
and
i
really
pity
you
when
i
see
you
imagining
yourself
strong
enough
to
conquer
in
a
battle
in
which
both
heaven
and
man
will
annihilate
you
is
not
i
who
am
strong
it
is
reason
it
is
truth
i
know
but
it
is
of
no
consequence
just
listen
to
me
i
will
not
have
you
here
as
schoolmaster
i
am
anxious
for
my
tranquillity
and
honourability
it
would
be
too
much
grief
and
shame
for
me
to
see
our
geneviève
here
in
maillebois
as
the
wife
of
a
man
denying
both
god
and
country
and
scandalising
all
pious
souls
by
his
actions
it
is
madness
i
tell
you
you
will
immediately
refuse
madame
berthereau
sorely
grieved
by
this
sudden
dispute
lowered
her
head
over
her
embroidery
in
order
that
she
might
not
have
to
intervene
geneviève
remained
erect
but
had
become
very
pale
while
little
louise
whose
hand
she
still
held
felt
so
frightened
that
she
hid
her
face
in
the
folds
of
her
mother
skirt
but
marc
was
determined
to
remain
calm
and
without
even
raising
his
voice
he
answered
i
can
not
refuse
i
have
come
to
a
decision
and
i
merely
desired
to
inform
you
of
it
at
this
madame
duparque
although
she
was
scarcely
able
to
move
by
reason
of
her
attack
of
gout
lost
all
as
a
rule
nobody
dared
to
resist
her
and
she
was
exasperated
at
now
finding
herself
confronted
by
such
quiet
determination
a
wave
of
terrible
anger
rose
within
her
and
words
she
would
rather
have
left
unspoken
rushed
from
her
lips
say
everything
she
cried
it
you
are
only
coming
here
in
order
that
you
may
busy
yourself
on
the
spot
with
that
abominable
simon
case
yes
you
are
on
the
side
of
those
ignoble
jews
you
still
think
of
stirring
up
all
that
filth
and
pouncing
upon
some
innocent
to
send
him
yonder
in
the
place
of
the
vile
assassin
who
was
so
justly
condemned
and
that
innocent
you
are
still
stubbornly
seeking
him
among
the
worthiest
of
god
servants
is
that
not
so
confess
it
why
do
you
confess
it
marc
could
not
help
smiling
for
he
fully
understood
that
the
real
cause
of
all
the
anger
with
which
he
was
assailed
was
indeed
the
simon
case
the
dread
lest
he
should
take
it
in
hand
again
and
at
last
discover
the
real
culprit
he
could
divine
that
behind
madame
duparque
there
stood
her
confessor
father
crabot
and
that
the
jesuits
and
their
allies
in
order
to
prevent
him
from
carrying
on
a
campaign
at
maillebois
were
determined
to
tolerate
there
no
schoolmaster
who
was
not
virtually
in
their
hands
certainly
he
answered
in
his
quiet
way
am
still
convinced
of
my
comrade
simon
innocence
and
i
shall
do
everything
i
can
to
demonstrate
it
madame
duparque
in
her
rage
jerked
herself
first
towards
madame
berthereau
and
then
towards
geneviève
hear
him
and
you
say
nothing
our
name
will
be
brought
into
that
campaign
of
ignominy
our
daughter
will
be
seen
in
the
camp
of
the
enemies
of
society
and
religion
come
come
you
who
are
her
mother
ought
to
tell
her
that
such
a
thing
is
out
of
question
that
she
must
prevent
such
infamy
for
the
honour
of
herself
and
that
of
all
of
us
the
old
lady
last
words
were
addressed
to
madame
berthereau
who
utterly
scared
by
the
quarrel
had
now
let
her
embroidery
fall
from
her
hands
for
a
moment
she
remained
silent
for
it
cost
her
an
effort
to
emerge
from
the
gloomy
in
which
she
usually
lived
at
last
making
up
her
mind
she
said
grandmother
is
right
my
girl
your
duty
requires
that
you
should
not
tolerate
actions
in
which
you
would
have
your
share
of
responsibility
before
god
your
husband
will
listen
to
you
if
he
loves
you
indeed
you
are
the
only
one
who
can
speak
to
his
heart
your
father
never
went
against
my
desires
in
matters
of
conscience
geneviève
turned
towards
marc
at
the
same
time
pressing
little
louise
to
her
side
she
was
stirred
to
the
depths
of
her
being
all
her
girlhood
at
the
convent
of
the
visitation
all
her
pious
training
and
education
seemed
to
revive
filling
her
with
vertigo
and
yet
she
repeated
what
she
had
already
said
to
her
husband
is
the
only
good
judge
he
will
do
what
he
deems
to
be
his
duty
despite
her
ailing
leg
madame
duparque
had
managed
to
struggle
to
her
feet
that
your
answer
she
cried
wrathfully
whom
we
brought
up
in
a
christian
manner
you
who
were
well
beloved
by
god
you
already
deny
him
and
live
religionless
like
some
beast
of
the
fields
and
you
choose
satan
without
making
even
an
effort
to
overcome
him
ah
well
your
husband
is
only
the
more
guilty
and
he
shall
be
punished
for
that
also
you
will
be
punished
both
of
you
and
god
curse
shall
extend
even
to
your
child
she
stretched
forth
her
arms
and
stood
there
in
such
a
threatening
posture
that
little
louise
who
was
began
to
sob
marc
quickly
caught
up
the
child
and
pressed
her
to
his
heart
while
she
as
if
eager
for
his
protection
flung
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
geneviève
likewise
drew
near
and
leant
against
the
shoulder
of
the
man
to
whom
she
had
given
her
life
gone
be
gone
all
three
of
you
cried
madame
duparque
to
your
folly
and
your
pride
they
will
work
your
ruin
you
hear
me
geneviève
there
shall
be
no
more
intercourse
between
us
until
you
come
back
here
in
all
humility
for
you
will
come
back
some
day
you
belonged
to
god
too
long
for
it
to
be
otherwise
besides
i
shall
pray
to
him
so
well
that
he
will
know
how
to
win
you
back
entirely
but
now
be
gone
be
gone
i
will
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
torn
by
anguish
her
eyes
full
of
tears
geneviève
looked
at
her
distracted
mother
who
was
weeping
silently
so
heartrending
was
the
scene
that
the
young
woman
again
seemed
to
hesitate
but
marc
gently
took
her
hand
and
led
her
away
madame
duparque
had
already
sunk
into
her
and
the
little
house
relapsed
into
its
frigid
gloom
and
dismal
silence
on
the
following
thursday
marc
repaired
to
beaumont
to
inform
salvan
that
he
accepted
his
offer
and
early
in
may
he
received
the
appointment
quitted
jonville
and
installed
himself
at
maillebois
as
of
the
boys
elementary
school
book
ii
i
one
sunny
morning
in
may
marc
for
the
first
time
took
his
class
at
maillebois
on
the
side
facing
the
square
the
large
schoolroom
had
three
lofty
windows
through
whose
panes
of
ground
glass
streamed
a
gay
white
and
vivid
light
in
front
of
the
master
desk
which
stood
on
a
small
platform
reached
by
three
steps
the
boys
little
double
desks
were
set
out
four
in
each
of
the
eight
rows
loud
laughter
in
fact
quite
an
uproar
burst
forth
when
one
of
the
lads
on
proceeding
to
his
seat
stumbled
and
fell
intentionally
boys
marc
quietly
said
must
behave
yourselves
i
am
not
going
to
punish
you
but
you
will
find
it
more
beneficial
and
pleasant
to
behave
yourselves
with
me
monsieur
mignot
please
call
the
register
marc
had
wished
to
have
mignot
assistance
on
this
first
occasion
and
the
other
demeanour
plainly
indicated
his
hostility
and
the
surprise
he
felt
at
having
as
his
principal
a
man
who
had
compromised
himself
so
greatly
in
the
recent
scandals
mignot
had
even
joined
in
the
laughter
when
one
of
them
had
stumbled
and
fallen
by
way
of
amusing
the
others
however
the
calling
of
the
register
began
doloir
exclaimed
a
lad
in
so
gruff
a
voice
that
the
whole
class
again
exploded
auguste
was
the
mason
elder
son
and
it
was
he
who
had
stumbled
a
few
minutes
previously
nine
years
of
age
he
looked
vigorous
and
intelligent
but
he
was
and
his
pranks
often
revolutionised
the
school
doloir
called
mignot
and
this
time
auguste
brother
two
years
his
junior
answered
in
so
shrill
a
voice
that
the
storm
of
laughter
began
afresh
though
charles
was
of
a
more
refined
and
gentle
nature
than
auguste
he
invariably
seconded
him
but
marc
let
the
matter
pass
he
wished
to
be
patient
and
to
inflict
no
punishments
that
first
day
while
the
calling
of
the
register
proceeded
he
glanced
round
the
large
room
where
he
would
have
to
deal
with
all
those
turbulent
lads
at
jonville
there
had
been
no
such
lavish
provision
of
blackboards
one
behind
his
desk
for
himself
and
two
others
right
and
left
for
the
boys
nor
such
a
display
of
coloured
prints
representing
weights
and
measures
the
mineral
vegetable
and
animal
kingdoms
useful
and
harmful
insects
mushrooms
and
toadstools
without
counting
the
large
and
numerous
maps
there
too
in
a
cabinet
was
a
collection
of
the
bodies
as
well
as
various
instruments
for
the
teaching
of
physics
and
chemistry
but
marc
did
not
find
among
his
new
pupils
the
good
understanding
and
cordiality
which
had
prevailed
among
those
whom
he
had
left
at
jonville
the
neglect
of
his
weak
and
ailing
predecessor
méchain
had
evidently
helped
to
disorganise
the
school
which
after
numbering
nearly
sixty
pupils
could
now
muster
scarcely
forty
thus
its
position
was
sorely
compromised
and
the
hard
task
of
restoring
it
to
prosperity
and
orderliness
lay
before
him
savin
mignot
called
there
was
no
answer
and
he
therefore
repeated
the
name
yet
both
the
savins
the
twin
sons
of
the
clerk
sat
at
one
of
the
double
desks
with
their
heads
lowered
and
a
sly
expression
on
their
faces
though
they
were
only
eight
years
of
age
they
seemed
already
proficient
in
prudent
hypocrisy
and
philippe
savin
mignot
repeated
glancing
at
them
thereupon
making
up
their
minds
they
answered
leisurely
but
in
unison
marc
who
felt
surprised
inquired
why
they
had
previously
remained
silent
but
he
could
obtain
no
answer
from
them
they
looked
at
him
distrustfully
as
if
they
had
to
defend
themselves
from
him
bongard
mignot
continued
again
nobody
answered
fernand
the
peasant
farmer
son
a
sturdy
boy
of
ten
sat
there
huddled
up
leaning
on
his
elbows
with
a
stupefied
expression
on
his
face
he
seemed
to
be
sleeping
with
his
eyes
open
but
one
of
his
schoolfellows
gave
him
a
nudge
and
then
in
a
scared
way
he
shouted
this
time
none
of
the
others
dared
to
laugh
for
they
feared
fists
and
silence
continuing
mignot
was
able
to
call
the
last
name
milhomme
marc
had
already
recognised
madame
alexandre
son
eight
years
of
age
with
a
face
all
gentleness
refinement
and
intelligence
he
sat
at
the
first
desk
on
the
right
hand
and
the
young
man
smiled
at
the
lad
charmed
by
his
candid
eyes
in
which
he
fancied
he
could
detect
the
early
sparkle
of
a
young
mind
such
as
he
desired
to
awaken
sébastien
answered
in
a
clear
gay
voice
which
to
marc
seemed
like
music
compared
with
all
the
full
or
mocking
voices
of
the
others
the
calling
of
the
register
was
finished
and
at
a
sign
from
mignot
all
the
boys
now
rose
for
prayers
since
simon
departure
méchain
had
allowed
prayers
to
be
said
at
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
each
class
yielding
in
this
respect
to
the
stealthy
persuasion
of
mademoiselle
rouzaire
who
citing
her
own
practice
as
an
example
asserted
that
the
fear
of
hell
greatly
helped
to
keep
her
pupils
quiet
moreover
parents
were
pleased
with
the
and
mauraisin
the
elementary
inspector
regarded
it
with
favour
although
it
in
no
wise
figured
in
the
regulations
that
morning
however
marc
swiftly
intervened
saying
in
his
quiet
and
resolute
way
down
boys
you
are
not
here
to
say
prayers
you
may
say
them
at
home
if
your
fathers
and
mothers
desire
it
mignot
nonplussed
looked
at
him
inquisitively
ah
well
he
would
not
exercise
much
authority
at
maillebois
if
he
began
by
suppressing
prayers
marc
fully
understood
the
meaning
of
his
assistant
glance
for
ever
since
his
arrival
in
the
little
town
he
had
been
conscious
of
the
general
feeling
the
conviction
that
he
was
destined
to
encounter
rapid
and
complete
defeat
besides
salvan
had
warned
him
and
had
recommended
extreme
prudence
a
course
of
skilful
tolerance
during
the
first
months
if
marc
after
due
reflection
ventured
to
suppress
prayers
it
was
as
a
first
step
the
result
of
which
would
enable
him
to
feel
his
way
he
would
have
liked
to
remove
the
big
crucifix
which
méchain
exhausted
by
the
pressure
brought
to
bear
on
him
had
allowed
to
be
hung
over
the
blackboard
behind
the
master
desk
but
the
young
man
felt
that
he
could
hardly
do
that
immediately
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
establish
himself
firmly
in
his
position
and
know
his
ground
thoroughly
before
he
engaged
in
a
real
battle
apart
from
the
crucifix
he
was
also
irritated
by
four
glaring
chromolithographs
which
hung
from
the
walls
one
of
them
representing
the
fable
of
geneviève
delivering
paris
another
joan
of
arc
listening
to
the
voices
from
heaven
another
louis
healing
the
sick
by
the
touch
of
his
hands
and
another
napoleon
riding
across
a
battlefield
miracle
and
force
religious
lie
and
military
violence
were
ever
given
as
examples
ever
sown
as
seed
in
the
minds
of
the
children
who
would
become
the
citizens
of
marc
asked
himself
if
all
that
ought
not
to
be
changed
if
education
ought
not
to
be
begun
afresh
at
the
very
beginning
with
lessons
of
truth
and
solidarity
if
one
was
to
create
free
and
intelligent
men
capable
of
practising
justice
the
first
class
was
duly
held
marc
gently
yet
firmly
taking
possession
of
his
post
among
his
new
pupils
whose
curiosity
he
found
tinged
with
rebellion
the
pacific
conquest
of
their
minds
and
hearts
which
the
young
master
desired
to
effect
proceeded
patiently
day
by
day
at
the
outset
he
occasionally
experienced
some
secret
bitterness
for
his
mind
wandered
back
to
the
pupils
the
children
of
his
brain
whom
he
had
left
at
jonville
and
whom
he
knew
to
be
now
in
the
hands
of
one
of
his
former
colleagues
jauffre
with
whose
spirit
of
intrigue
and
thirst
for
immediate
success
he
was
well
acquainted
he
felt
some
remorse
at
the
thought
that
he
had
abandoned
his
work
yonder
to
one
who
would
surely
destroy
it
and
his
only
consolation
lay
in
the
circumstance
that
he
had
taken
up
yet
more
pressing
and
necessary
work
at
maillebois
to
that
work
he
became
more
and
more
passionately
attached
devoting
himself
to
it
with
enthusiastic
faith
as
the
days
flew
by
and
lesson
followed
lesson
on
the
morrow
of
the
general
elections
which
took
place
during
that
month
of
may
quietude
fell
upon
the
region
prior
to
those
elections
silence
and
restraint
with
respect
to
simon
case
had
been
declared
imperative
in
order
that
the
result
of
the
polling
might
not
prove
disastrous
for
the
republic
and
directly
those
elections
were
over
the
new
chamber
of
deputies
being
composed
of
virtually
the
same
men
as
the
previous
one
silence
was
again
declared
to
be
necessary
lest
by
raising
inopportune
questions
one
should
retard
the
realisation
of
promised
reforms
the
truth
was
that
after
all
the
battling
of
the
electoral
campaign
the
successful
candidates
desired
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
victory
in
peace
thus
at
beaumont
neither
lemarrois
nor
marcilly
on
being
was
willing
to
mention
simon
name
although
each
had
promised
to
act
as
soon
as
his
mandate
should
be
renewed
and
he
should
no
longer
have
to
fear
the
blindness
of
universal
suffrage
but
at
present
it
was
held
that
simon
had
been
judged
and
well
judged
in
fact
the
slightest
allusion
to
his
affair
was
deemed
contrary
to
patriotism
naturally
enough
the
same
views
prevailed
at
maillebois
darras
the
mayor
even
begged
marc
in
the
interest
of
the
unhappy
prisoner
and
his
relatives
to
do
nothing
whatever
but
to
wait
for
some
wakening
of
public
opinion
meantime
absolute
forgetfulness
was
effected
perfect
silence
was
enjoined
as
if
there
were
no
simonists
or
left
marc
had
to
resign
himself
to
the
position
particularly
as
he
was
entreated
in
that
sense
by
the
ever
humble
and
anxious
lehmanns
and
even
by
david
who
with
all
his
heroic
tenacity
understood
the
necessity
of
patience
yet
simon
brother
was
now
following
up
a
serious
clue
indirectly
and
without
positive
proof
thereof
he
had
heard
of
the
illegal
communication
which
president
gragnon
had
made
to
the
jury
in
their
retiring
room
prior
to
the
verdict
and
if
he
could
only
establish
the
fact
that
this
communication
had
been
really
made
the
annulment
of
all
the
proceedings
would
necessarily
follow
but
david
was
conscious
of
the
difficulties
of
the
times
and
prosecuted
his
inquiries
with
the
greatest
secrecy
for
fear
of
warning
his
adversaries
marc
though
of
a
more
feverish
spirit
at
last
consented
to
follow
the
same
tactics
and
feign
forgetfulness
thus
the
simon
affair
began
to
slumber
as
if
it
were
ended
and
forgotten
whereas
in
reality
it
remained
the
secret
sore
the
poisoned
incurable
wound
of
which
the
social
body
ever
exposed
to
the
danger
of
some
sudden
and
mortal
outburst
of
delirium
was
dying
for
be
it
remembered
one
single
act
of
injustice
may
suffice
for
a
whole
nation
to
be
stricken
with
dementia
and
slowly
die
in
this
position
of
affairs
marc
for
a
time
was
able
to
devote
himself
entirely
to
his
school
duties
and
he
did
so
with
the
conviction
that
he
was
contributing
to
the
only
work
by
which
iniquity
may
be
destroyed
and
its
renewal
prevented
that
work
which
consists
in
diffusing
knowledge
and
sowing
the
seeds
of
truth
among
the
rising
generations
never
before
had
he
understood
so
fully
the
terrible
difficulties
of
the
task
he
found
himself
utterly
alone
he
felt
that
his
pupils
and
their
parents
his
assistant
mignot
and
his
neighbour
mademoiselle
rouzaire
were
all
against
him
and
the
times
were
disastrous
the
brothers
school
recruited
five
more
pupils
from
the
communal
school
during
marc
first
month
a
blast
of
unpopularity
threatened
to
sweep
the
young
man
away
parents
went
to
the
ignorantines
in
order
to
save
their
children
from
the
abominations
of
that
new
secular
master
who
had
suppressed
prayers
on
the
very
day
he
had
entered
upon
his
functions
thus
brother
fulgence
was
quite
triumphant
he
was
again
assisted
by
brothers
gorgias
and
isidore
who
had
disappeared
for
a
while
after
simon
trial
and
who
now
had
been
recalled
by
way
of
showing
no
doubt
that
the
community
deemed
itself
to
be
above
suspicion
if
brother
lazarus
the
third
assistant
had
not
returned
to
maillebois
with
the
others
the
reason
was
that
he
had
died
during
his
absence
the
others
remained
the
masters
of
the
town
whose
streets
were
always
full
of
cassocks
for
marc
the
worst
was
the
mocking
contempt
with
which
all
those
folk
seemed
to
regard
him
they
did
not
condescend
to
make
any
violent
attack
on
him
they
waited
for
him
to
commit
suicide
by
some
act
of
stupendous
folly
mignot
demeanour
on
the
first
day
had
become
that
of
the
whole
district
as
mademoiselle
rouzaire
said
it
was
expected
that
marc
would
render
his
position
untenable
in
less
than
two
months
the
young
man
detected
the
hopes
of
his
adversaries
by
the
manner
in
which
inspector
mauraisin
spoke
to
him
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
visit
mauraisin
knowing
that
marc
was
covered
by
salvan
and
le
barazer
displayed
a
kind
of
ironical
indulgence
allowing
the
young
man
to
follow
his
own
course
but
watching
stealthily
for
some
serious
blunder
which
would
enable
him
to
apply
for
his
removal
to
another
part
he
said
nothing
about
the
suppression
of
prayers
he
desired
something
more
decisive
an
of
crushing
facts
the
inspector
was
seen
laughing
over
the
matter
with
mademoiselle
rouzaire
one
of
his
favourites
and
from
that
moment
marc
was
surrounded
by
spies
eager
to
denounce
both
his
expressions
of
opinion
and
his
actions
every
time
that
marc
called
upon
salvan
in
search
of
a
little
comfort
his
protector
repeated
to
him
prudent
my
friend
yesterday
le
barazer
received
another
anonymous
letter
denouncing
you
as
a
poisoner
and
a
henchman
of
hell
you
know
that
i
wish
all
success
to
the
good
work
but
i
also
think
that
it
may
be
compromised
by
precipitate
action
as
a
beginning
render
yourself
necessary
bring
back
affluence
to
the
school
get
yourself
liked
at
this
marc
however
bitter
his
feelings
ended
by
smiling
are
right
i
feel
it
is
so
he
answered
is
by
force
of
wisdom
and
affection
that
one
must
conquer
he
geneviève
and
little
louise
were
now
dwelling
in
the
quarters
formerly
allotted
to
simon
the
lodging
was
larger
and
more
comfortable
than
that
of
jonville
there
were
two
bedrooms
and
two
besides
a
kitchen
and
dependencies
and
the
whole
was
very
clean
and
very
bright
full
of
sunshine
and
overlooked
a
fairly
large
garden
in
which
vegetables
and
flowers
grew
but
the
young
couple
furniture
was
scanty
and
since
their
quarrel
with
madame
duparque
it
was
difficult
for
them
to
make
both
ends
meet
for
marc
meagre
salary
was
all
they
had
to
depend
upon
that
salary
now
amounted
to
twelve
hundred
francs
a
year
but
it
really
represented
no
more
than
the
thousand
francs
allowed
at
jonville
for
there
marc
had
also
received
payment
as
parish
clerk
which
post
was
not
to
be
thought
of
at
maillebois
and
how
were
they
to
manage
on
a
hundred
francs
a
month
in
that
little
town
where
living
was
more
expensive
than
in
the
village
how
were
they
to
maintain
some
little
appearance
of
dignity
and
comfort
how
was
marc
to
wear
fairly
respectable
frock
coats
such
as
usage
demanded
it
was
a
grave
problem
the
solution
of
which
required
prodigies
of
thrift
continuous
secret
heroism
in
all
the
petty
details
of
life
they
often
ate
dry
bread
in
order
that
they
might
have
clean
linen
but
in
geneviève
marc
found
a
valuable
an
admirable
helpmate
she
renewed
the
exploits
she
had
accomplished
at
jonville
she
managed
to
provide
for
all
the
requirements
of
the
home
without
allowing
much
of
its
penury
to
be
seen
she
had
to
attend
to
everything
cooking
washing
and
mending
and
louise
was
ever
all
smiles
and
smartness
in
her
little
frocks
if
mignot
according
to
usage
had
taken
his
meals
with
his
principal
the
money
paid
for
his
board
might
have
helped
geneviève
slightly
but
the
young
bachelor
who
had
his
own
quarters
on
the
other
side
of
the
landing
preferred
to
patronise
a
neighbouring
perhaps
in
order
to
mark
his
hostility
and
to
avoid
compromising
himself
by
any
companionship
with
a
man
for
whom
mademoiselle
rouzaire
predicted
the
worst
catastrophes
he
mignot
with
his
paltry
monthly
salary
of
francs
and
centimes
led
the
usual
wretched
life
of
a
young
ill
clad
and
ill
fed
with
no
other
diversion
within
his
reach
than
that
of
fishing
on
thursdays
and
sundays
this
rendered
him
all
the
more
and
distrustful
as
though
indeed
it
were
fault
if
he
partook
of
such
sorry
messes
at
the
yet
geneviève
displayed
solicitude
for
his
welfare
she
offered
to
mend
his
linen
and
one
evening
when
he
was
suffering
from
a
cold
she
hastened
to
make
him
some
as
she
and
her
husband
said
the
young
fellow
was
not
he
was
badly
advised
perhaps
by
showing
him
some
kindness
and
equity
they
might
at
last
win
him
over
to
better
sentiments
footnote
a
little
less
than
that
which
geneviève
dared
not
say
for
fear
of
grieving
marc
was
that
the
home
suffered
particularly
from
the
quarrel
with
madame
duparque
in
former
days
the
grandmother
had
provided
louise
with
clothes
made
presents
and
rendered
assistance
at
difficult
times
now
that
the
young
people
were
at
maillebois
only
a
few
doors
distant
from
the
old
lady
she
might
often
have
helped
them
under
the
circumstances
it
was
very
embarrassing
to
live
so
near
and
to
be
obliged
to
turn
one
head
aside
every
time
one
met
her
on
two
occasions
little
louise
who
being
only
three
years
of
age
could
not
understand
the
situation
held
out
her
arms
and
called
when
the
old
lady
passed
in
such
wise
that
the
fated
reconciliation
ended
by
taking
place
geneviève
on
returning
home
one
day
in
a
state
of
great
emotion
related
that
she
had
yielded
to
circumstances
and
had
embraced
her
grandmother
and
mother
on
meeting
them
on
the
place
des
capucins
where
louise
in
all
innocence
had
run
forward
and
cast
herself
into
their
arms
at
this
confession
marc
in
his
turn
kissed
his
wife
saying
with
a
smile
that
is
all
right
my
darling
for
your
sake
and
louise
i
am
well
pleased
with
the
reconciliation
it
was
bound
to
come
and
if
i
am
on
bad
terms
with
those
ladies
you
surely
imagine
that
i
am
such
a
barbarian
as
to
demand
the
same
of
you
my
friend
geneviève
replied
it
is
very
embarrassing
in
a
family
when
the
wife
visits
a
place
where
her
husband
can
not
go
should
it
be
embarrassing
for
the
sake
of
peace
it
is
best
that
i
should
not
call
on
your
grandmother
again
for
i
can
not
possibly
agree
with
her
but
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
you
and
the
little
one
from
visiting
her
and
your
mother
also
from
time
to
time
geneviève
had
become
grave
her
eyes
fell
and
while
she
reflected
she
quivered
should
have
preferred
not
to
go
to
grandmother
without
you
she
said
feel
firmer
when
we
are
together
but
you
are
right
i
understand
that
it
would
be
painful
for
you
to
accompany
me
and
on
the
other
hand
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
break
off
now
thus
the
question
was
settled
at
first
geneviève
went
but
once
a
week
to
the
little
house
on
the
place
des
capucins
taking
louise
with
her
and
spending
an
hour
there
during
the
school
work
of
marc
who
contented
himself
with
bowing
to
the
ladies
when
he
met
them
and
now
for
a
period
of
two
years
with
infinite
patience
and
good
nature
marc
prosecuted
the
conquest
of
his
pupils
amid
hostile
surroundings
and
innumerable
worries
he
was
a
born
teacher
one
who
knew
how
to
become
a
child
again
in
order
that
children
might
understand
him
and
in
particular
he
strove
to
be
gay
he
willingly
joined
in
his
pupils
play
behaving
as
if
he
were
simply
a
companion
an
elder
brother
and
in
the
school
work
his
strength
lay
in
his
power
to
cast
his
science
aside
to
place
himself
within
the
reach
of
young
and
imperfectly
awakened
minds
by
finding
easy
explanatory
words
suited
to
each
occasion
it
was
as
if
he
himself
were
still
somewhat
ignorant
and
participated
in
the
delight
of
learning
heavily
laden
as
the
curriculum
might
be
what
with
reading
writing
grammar
orthography
composition
arithmetic
history
geography
elementary
science
singing
gymnastics
notions
of
agriculture
manual
work
morals
and
civic
instruction
he
passed
nothing
by
until
the
lads
had
understood
it
all
his
first
efforts
indeed
were
concentrated
on
method
in
order
that
nothing
taught
might
be
lost
but
that
everything
might
be
positively
and
fully
assimilated
ah
how
fervently
did
marc
devote
himself
to
that
sowing
and
cultivation
of
truth
he
strove
to
plan
things
in
such
wise
that
truth
might
impose
itself
on
his
pupils
by
its
own
power
nourish
their
expanding
minds
and
become
both
their
flesh
and
their
brains
and
what
truth
it
was
it
so
happens
that
every
error
claims
to
be
truth
does
not
even
the
roman
catholic
church
though
based
on
absurd
dogmas
pretend
that
it
is
the
sole
truth
thus
marc
began
by
teaching
that
there
is
no
truth
outside
the
pale
of
reason
logic
and
particularly
experiment
when
the
son
of
a
peasant
or
a
workman
is
told
by
his
schoolmaster
that
the
world
is
round
and
revolves
in
space
he
accepts
the
statement
upon
trust
just
as
he
accepts
the
statements
made
to
him
by
the
priest
on
matters
of
religion
at
the
catechism
class
in
order
that
he
may
appreciate
the
difference
experiment
must
show
him
the
scientific
certainty
of
the
former
statement
all
revealed
truth
is
falsehood
experimental
truth
alone
is
accurate
one
entire
eternal
marc
therefore
at
the
outset
found
it
necessary
to
rebut
the
catholic
catechism
by
the
scientific
catechism
he
took
the
world
and
mankind
as
they
were
explained
by
science
and
set
them
forth
in
their
living
reality
and
their
march
towards
a
continual
and
ever
more
and
more
perfect
future
there
was
no
possibility
of
real
amelioration
liberation
and
happiness
otherwise
than
by
truth
that
is
by
knowledge
of
the
conditions
in
which
mankind
exists
and
progresses
all
the
craving
for
knowledge
as
a
means
for
rapid
attainment
to
health
and
peace
bore
within
itself
its
method
of
free
expansion
science
ceasing
to
be
a
dead
letter
and
becoming
a
source
of
life
an
excitant
of
temperament
and
character
marc
as
far
as
possible
left
books
upon
one
side
in
order
to
compel
his
pupils
to
judge
things
for
themselves
they
only
knew
things
well
when
they
had
seen
or
touched
them
he
never
asked
them
to
believe
in
a
phenomenon
until
he
had
proved
its
reality
by
experiment
the
whole
domain
of
unproven
facts
was
set
aside
in
reserve
for
future
investigation
but
he
demonstrated
that
with
the
help
of
the
acquired
truths
mankind
might
already
rear
for
itself
a
large
and
splendid
home
of
security
and
brotherliness
to
see
things
for
oneself
to
convince
oneself
of
what
one
ought
to
believe
to
develop
one
reasoning
powers
and
one
individuality
in
accordance
with
the
reasons
of
existence
and
action
such
were
the
principles
which
governed
marc
teaching
method
the
only
one
by
which
true
men
might
be
created
but
knowledge
was
not
sufficient
a
social
bond
a
spiritual
link
of
perpetual
solidarity
was
required
and
this
marc
found
in
justice
he
had
often
noticed
with
what
a
flash
of
rebellion
a
boy
molested
in
his
rights
would
exclaim
is
fair
indeed
any
act
of
injustice
raises
a
tempest
in
the
depths
of
those
young
minds
and
brings
them
frightful
suffering
this
is
because
the
idea
of
justice
in
them
is
absolute
mark
turned
to
good
use
the
candour
of
equity
the
innate
need
of
truth
and
justice
that
one
finds
in
children
when
life
has
not
yet
inclined
them
to
mendacious
and
iniquitous
compromises
by
way
of
truth
towards
justice
such
was
the
road
along
which
he
strove
to
direct
his
pupils
as
often
as
possible
requiring
them
to
judge
themselves
when
they
happened
to
be
in
fault
if
they
had
told
a
falsehood
he
made
them
admit
the
wrong
they
had
done
both
to
their
schoolfellows
and
to
themselves
if
they
were
disorderly
and
delayed
lessons
he
showed
them
that
they
were
the
first
to
suffer
at
times
a
culprit
spontaneously
admitted
his
offence
thus
earning
forgiveness
emulation
in
equity
ended
by
animating
those
young
people
they
learnt
to
rival
one
another
in
frankness
at
times
of
course
there
was
trouble
conflict
catastrophe
for
all
this
was
only
a
beginning
and
several
generations
of
schoolboys
would
be
needed
for
schools
to
become
the
real
abodes
of
healthy
and
happy
life
marc
however
rejoiced
over
the
slightest
results
that
he
obtained
convinced
as
he
was
that
if
knowledge
were
primarily
essential
for
all
progress
nothing
definitive
with
respect
to
the
happiness
of
mankind
could
be
achieved
without
the
assistance
of
the
spirit
of
justice
why
did
the
class
which
was
the
best
educated
become
rotten
so
soon
was
it
not
by
reason
of
its
iniquities
its
denial
of
justice
its
refusal
to
restore
what
it
had
stolen
to
give
to
the
humble
and
the
suffering
their
legitimate
share
of
the
world
good
things
some
folk
in
condemning
education
cited
the
ignominious
downfall
of
the
as
an
example
and
accused
science
of
producing
a
multitude
of
casteless
individuals
thereby
increasing
the
sum
of
evil
and
tribulation
and
yes
so
long
as
the
passion
for
knowledge
merely
for
its
own
sake
should
become
keener
and
keener
in
a
social
system
which
was
all
falsehood
and
injustice
it
would
only
add
to
existing
ruins
it
was
necessary
that
science
should
tend
towards
justice
and
bring
to
the
future
city
of
fraternity
a
moral
system
of
liberty
and
peace
even
to
be
just
did
not
suffice
marc
also
required
kindliness
and
affection
of
his
pupils
nothing
could
germinate
nothing
could
flower
unless
it
were
by
love
and
for
it
in
the
universal
flame
of
desire
and
union
one
found
the
focus
of
the
world
within
each
human
being
was
implanted
an
imperious
need
to
mingle
with
all
others
and
personal
action
liberty
and
individuality
were
like
the
play
of
different
organs
all
dependent
on
the
universal
being
if
each
individual
man
even
when
isolated
represented
so
much
will
and
power
his
actions
at
all
events
only
began
to
count
when
they
exercised
an
influence
on
the
community
to
love
to
make
oneself
loved
to
make
all
others
love
the
teacher
was
found
entire
in
those
three
propositions
those
three
degrees
of
human
instruction
to
love
marc
loved
his
pupils
with
his
whole
heart
giving
himself
to
them
unreservedly
knowing
full
well
that
one
must
indeed
love
if
one
would
teach
for
only
love
has
the
power
of
touching
and
convincing
to
make
oneself
loved
that
was
a
task
to
which
he
devoted
every
hour
fraternising
with
his
boys
never
seeking
to
make
them
fear
him
but
on
the
contrary
striving
to
win
them
over
by
persuasion
affection
the
of
an
elder
brother
still
growing
up
among
his
juniors
to
make
all
others
love
that
again
was
his
constant
thought
he
was
ever
recalling
the
true
saying
that
the
happiness
of
each
is
compounded
of
the
happiness
of
all
and
he
brought
forward
the
daily
example
of
the
progress
and
pleasure
of
each
boy
when
the
whole
class
had
worked
well
schooling
no
doubt
should
have
as
its
objects
the
culture
of
energy
the
liberation
and
exaltation
of
each
individuality
a
child
must
judge
and
act
by
himself
alone
in
order
that
as
a
man
he
may
yield
the
of
his
personal
value
but
as
marc
put
it
would
not
the
crop
resulting
from
such
intensive
culture
increase
the
common
harvest
of
all
could
a
man
create
true
glory
for
himself
without
contributing
in
one
or
another
form
to
the
happiness
of
others
education
necessarily
tended
to
solidarity
to
the
universal
attraction
which
was
gradually
blending
mankind
into
one
family
and
marc
mind
and
heart
were
set
on
sympathy
and
affection
on
a
joyous
brotherly
school
full
of
sunshine
song
and
laughter
where
happiness
was
taught
where
the
pupils
learnt
to
live
the
life
of
science
truth
and
justice
which
would
come
in
all
its
fulness
when
the
way
for
it
should
have
been
sufficiently
prepared
by
generations
of
children
taught
as
they
ought
to
be
from
the
very
outset
marc
combated
the
system
by
which
violence
terror
and
folly
were
inculcated
in
so
many
children
the
right
of
the
stronger
massacre
carnage
the
devastation
and
razing
of
cities
all
those
things
were
set
before
the
young
glorified
in
books
pictures
and
constant
almost
hourly
lessons
great
was
the
display
of
the
bloody
pages
of
history
the
wars
the
conquests
the
names
of
the
captains
who
had
butchered
their
the
minds
of
children
were
enfevered
by
the
crash
of
arms
by
nightmares
of
slaughter
steeping
the
plains
in
blood
in
the
prize
books
given
to
them
in
the
little
papers
published
for
their
perusal
on
the
very
covers
of
their
copybooks
their
eyes
encountered
the
savagery
of
armies
the
burning
of
fleets
the
everlasting
calamity
of
man
sinking
to
the
level
of
a
wolf
and
when
a
battle
was
not
depicted
there
came
a
miracle
some
absurd
legend
some
source
of
darkness
a
saint
delivering
a
country
by
his
or
her
prayers
an
intervention
of
jesus
or
mary
ensuring
the
ownership
of
the
world
to
the
wealthy
a
churchman
solving
political
and
social
difficulties
by
a
mere
sign
of
the
cross
the
humble
were
invariably
warned
that
they
must
show
obedience
and
resignation
to
impress
it
on
their
minds
in
childhood
hour
stormy
skies
were
shown
them
illumined
by
the
lightning
of
an
irritated
and
cruel
deity
terror
reigned
terror
of
that
deity
terror
too
of
the
devil
a
base
and
hideous
terror
which
seized
on
man
in
his
infancy
and
kept
him
cowering
until
he
reached
the
grave
after
a
life
which
was
all
dense
night
ignorance
and
falsehood
in
that
manner
one
fashioned
only
slaves
flesh
fit
to
serve
the
master
capricious
purposes
and
indeed
that
education
of
blind
faith
and
perpetual
extermination
was
based
on
the
necessity
of
ever
having
soldiers
ready
to
defend
the
established
and
iniquitous
order
of
things
yet
what
an
antiquated
idea
it
was
to
cultivate
human
energy
by
lessons
of
warfare
it
corresponded
with
the
times
when
the
sword
alone
decided
questions
between
nation
and
nation
and
between
kings
and
their
subjects
but
nowadays
if
nations
still
guard
themselves
as
they
do
in
formidable
fashion
full
of
anxious
dread
lest
everything
should
collapse
who
will
dare
to
say
that
victory
will
rest
with
the
warlike
nations
who
on
the
contrary
can
not
see
that
the
triumphant
nation
of
will
be
that
which
defeats
the
others
on
the
economic
field
by
reorganising
the
conditions
of
human
toil
and
by
bringing
more
justice
and
happiness
to
mankind
to
marc
it
seemed
that
the
only
worthy
for
france
was
that
of
completing
the
revolution
and
becoming
the
great
emancipator
the
narrow
doctrine
that
one
sole
purpose
should
be
to
make
soldiers
of
frenchmen
filled
him
with
grief
and
anger
on
the
morrow
of
the
disasters
of
such
a
programme
may
have
had
its
excuse
and
yet
all
the
unrest
of
years
and
years
the
whole
abominable
crisis
of
the
present
times
has
proceeded
from
that
programme
from
having
placed
one
supreme
hope
in
the
army
from
having
abandoned
the
democracy
to
military
leaders
if
it
be
still
necessary
to
guard
oneself
surrounded
as
one
is
by
neighbours
in
arms
it
is
yet
more
necessary
to
become
workers
free
and
just
citizens
such
as
those
to
whom
will
belong
on
the
day
when
france
knows
it
and
wills
it
on
the
day
when
she
becomes
a
nation
freed
from
error
the
empires
around
her
will
crumble
beneath
the
breath
of
truth
and
justice
emanating
from
her
lips
a
breath
which
will
achieve
that
which
can
never
be
accomplished
by
all
her
armies
and
her
guns
nations
awaken
nations
and
on
the
day
when
one
by
one
the
nations
rise
enlightened
instructed
by
example
the
world
will
witness
the
victory
of
peace
the
end
of
war
marc
could
imagine
for
his
country
no
more
splendid
than
that
of
hastening
the
day
when
all
countries
would
mingle
in
one
thus
he
kept
a
strict
watch
over
his
pupils
books
replacing
as
far
as
possible
all
pictures
and
descriptions
of
spurious
miracles
and
bloody
battles
by
others
which
dealt
with
the
truths
of
science
and
the
fruitful
labours
of
mankind
the
one
true
source
of
energy
lies
in
work
for
happiness
sake
in
the
course
of
the
second
year
some
good
results
were
already
manifest
dividing
his
school
into
two
classes
marc
took
charge
of
the
first
composed
of
boys
from
nine
to
thirteen
years
of
age
while
mignot
attended
to
the
second
in
which
the
lads
were
from
six
to
nine
years
old
the
young
principal
also
adopted
the
system
of
appointing
monitors
whence
he
derived
certain
advantages
a
saving
of
time
in
some
matters
and
an
increase
of
emulation
among
his
boys
not
a
moment
was
lost
during
school
hours
yet
he
allowed
the
lads
as
much
independence
as
possible
chatting
with
them
provoking
objections
from
them
and
imposing
nothing
on
them
by
dint
of
authority
desirous
as
he
was
that
all
feeling
of
certainty
should
come
from
their
own
minds
thus
gaiety
prevailed
and
the
lessons
in
which
those
young
minds
passed
from
discovery
to
discovery
were
full
of
attractiveness
on
one
matter
only
did
marc
insist
and
that
was
great
cleanliness
under
his
guidance
the
lads
took
pleasure
in
washing
their
hands
at
the
water
taps
and
the
classroom
windows
were
opened
widely
at
each
interval
between
lessons
as
well
as
afterwards
before
marc
time
it
had
been
the
practice
a
usual
one
in
french
elementary
schools
for
the
boys
to
sweep
the
schoolroom
floor
whereby
they
raised
a
terrible
amount
of
dust
a
redoubtable
means
of
spreading
contagion
but
he
taught
them
to
wash
the
floor
with
sponges
a
duty
which
they
soon
regarded
as
a
pastime
one
sunshiny
day
in
may
two
years
after
marc
appointment
to
maillebois
inspector
mauraisin
paid
the
school
a
surprise
visit
during
the
interval
between
morning
lessons
it
was
in
vain
that
he
had
hitherto
kept
a
watch
on
marc
he
was
disconcerted
by
the
young
prudence
infuriated
by
his
inability
to
send
in
a
bad
report
such
as
would
have
justified
removal
that
clumsy
revolutionary
dreamer
whom
nobody
had
expected
to
see
six
months
in
office
was
becoming
a
perfect
fixture
to
the
amazement
and
scandal
of
all
people
by
devising
that
surprise
visit
however
the
inspector
hoped
to
catch
him
in
fault
as
it
happened
the
boys
had
just
been
washing
the
classroom
floor
and
handsome
little
mauraisin
sprucely
buttoned
up
in
his
frock
coat
raised
a
cry
of
alarm
are
you
flooded
when
marc
explained
that
he
had
replaced
sweeping
by
washing
for
reasons
of
hygiene
the
inspector
shrugged
his
shoulders
novelty
said
he
might
at
least
have
warned
the
administration
besides
all
this
water
can
not
be
healthy
it
must
tend
to
rheumatism
you
will
please
content
yourself
with
the
broom
so
long
as
you
are
not
authorised
to
use
sponges
then
as
the
interval
between
lessons
was
not
quite
over
he
began
to
rummage
everywhere
even
opening
the
cupboards
to
see
if
their
contents
were
in
order
perhaps
he
hoped
to
find
some
bad
books
some
anarchist
pamphlets
at
all
events
he
criticised
everything
laid
stress
on
the
slightest
sign
of
negligence
passing
censure
in
a
loud
voice
in
the
very
midst
of
the
boys
by
way
of
humiliating
marc
in
their
presence
at
last
the
boys
having
resumed
their
seats
the
usual
questioning
began
mauraisin
first
attack
fell
upon
mignot
because
little
charles
doloir
eight
years
of
age
and
therefore
in
the
second
class
was
unable
to
answer
a
question
on
a
subject
which
he
had
not
yet
studied
you
are
behindhand
with
the
programme
said
the
inspector
your
pupils
ought
to
have
reached
that
lesson
two
months
ago
mignot
who
though
he
stood
there
in
a
respectful
attitude
was
plainly
irritated
by
the
other
aggressive
tone
turned
towards
his
principal
it
was
indeed
at
the
latter
that
mauraisin
had
really
aimed
his
remark
and
so
the
young
replied
me
monsieur
it
was
i
who
thought
it
right
to
intervert
certain
parts
of
the
programme
in
order
to
make
some
of
the
lessons
clearer
besides
is
it
not
better
to
attend
less
to
the
exact
order
of
the
lessons
as
given
in
the
books
than
to
their
spirit
in
such
wise
however
that
all
may
be
taught
to
the
boys
in
the
course
of
the
year
mauraisin
affected
great
indignation
you
interfere
with
the
programme
monsieur
you
yourself
decide
what
to
take
of
it
and
what
to
leave
out
you
substitute
your
fancy
for
the
wisdom
of
your
superiors
well
they
shall
know
that
this
class
is
behindhand
then
his
glance
falling
on
the
elder
doloir
auguste
who
was
ten
years
old
he
told
him
to
stand
up
and
began
to
question
him
about
the
reign
of
terror
asking
him
to
name
the
leaders
of
the
period
robespierre
danton
marat
marat
handsome
my
boy
he
inquired
now
auguste
doloir
though
marc
had
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
little
better
behaviour
from
him
was
still
the
rebel
and
trickster
of
the
school
either
from
ignorance
or
roguishness
it
was
hard
to
say
he
now
made
answer
very
handsome
monsieur
his
schoolfellows
vastly
amused
laughed
and
wriggled
on
their
seats
no
my
boy
exclaimed
mauraisin
was
hideous
with
every
vice
and
every
crime
stamped
upon
his
countenance
and
turning
towards
marc
he
added
clumsily
enough
do
not
teach
them
that
marat
was
handsome
i
imagine
monsieur
the
master
answered
with
a
smile
laughter
arose
once
more
and
mignot
had
to
step
between
the
desks
to
restore
order
while
mauraisin
clinging
to
the
subject
of
marat
began
to
refer
to
charlotte
corday
as
luck
would
have
it
he
addressed
himself
to
fernand
bongard
now
a
tall
boy
of
eleven
whom
he
probably
imagined
to
be
one
of
the
most
advanced
pupils
you
big
fellow
yonder
can
you
tell
me
how
marat
died
he
could
not
have
been
more
unlucky
it
was
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
marc
taught
fernand
anything
the
lad
was
not
merely
he
did
not
try
to
learn
and
as
for
the
names
and
dates
of
history
he
was
on
the
worst
possible
terms
with
them
he
rose
with
a
scared
expression
in
his
dilated
eyes
compose
yourself
my
boy
said
mauraisin
not
marat
die
under
peculiar
circumstances
fernand
remained
silent
with
his
mouth
wide
open
but
a
compassionate
schoolfellow
behind
him
whispered
a
bath
whereupon
in
a
very
loud
voice
he
answered
drowned
himself
while
taking
a
bath
this
time
the
laughter
became
delirium
and
mauraisin
flew
into
a
temper
boys
are
really
stupid
he
exclaimed
was
killed
in
his
bath
by
charlotte
corday
a
young
girl
of
nature
who
sacrificed
herself
in
order
to
save
france
from
a
monster
thirsting
for
blood
are
you
taught
nothing
then
as
you
can
not
answer
the
simplest
questions
however
he
interrogated
the
twin
brothers
savin
achille
and
philippe
respecting
the
religious
wars
and
obtained
fairly
satisfactory
answers
from
them
they
were
scarcely
popular
in
the
school
for
not
only
were
they
sly
and
addicted
to
falsehoods
but
they
denounced
those
of
their
schoolfellows
whom
they
saw
in
fault
besides
telling
their
father
of
everything
that
occurred
nevertheless
the
inspector
won
over
by
their
hypocritical
ways
cited
them
as
examples
boys
know
at
least
something
said
he
and
again
addressing
himself
to
philippe
he
inquired
can
you
tell
me
what
one
ought
to
do
to
follow
religion
properly
ought
to
go
to
mass
monsieur
doubt
but
that
is
not
sufficient
one
ought
to
do
everything
that
religion
teaches
you
hear
my
boy
everything
that
religion
teaches
marc
looked
at
mauraisin
in
stupefaction
still
he
did
not
intervene
for
he
guessed
that
the
inspector
in
putting
that
singular
question
had
been
prompted
by
a
desire
to
make
him
compromise
himself
by
some
imprudent
remark
indeed
that
was
so
fully
the
other
object
that
he
continued
aggressively
addressing
himself
this
time
to
sébastien
milhomme
the
little
boy
yonder
with
the
fair
hair
tell
me
what
religion
teaches
sébastien
who
stood
erect
with
an
expression
of
consternation
on
his
face
made
no
answer
he
was
the
best
pupil
of
the
class
with
a
quick
intelligent
mind
and
an
affectionate
and
gentle
disposition
his
inability
to
answer
the
inspector
brought
tears
to
his
eyes
as
he
received
no
lessons
in
religion
he
did
not
even
understand
what
he
was
asked
you
need
not
look
at
me
like
that
you
little
stupid
exclaimed
mauraisin
question
is
clear
enough
but
marc
was
unable
to
restrain
himself
any
longer
the
embarrassment
of
his
best
pupil
to
whom
he
was
growing
extremely
attached
proved
unbearable
to
him
so
he
came
to
his
help
me
monsieur
the
teachings
of
religion
are
contained
in
the
church
catechism
and
the
catechism
is
not
included
in
our
programme
so
how
can
the
lad
answer
you
this
answer
no
doubt
was
what
mauraisin
had
expected
have
no
lessons
to
receive
from
you
monsieur
le
maître
he
responded
feigning
anger
once
more
know
what
i
am
about
there
is
no
properly
conducted
school
in
which
a
child
can
not
give
a
general
answer
to
a
question
about
the
religion
of
his
country
repeat
monsieur
rejoined
marc
in
a
firm
voice
in
which
a
little
rising
anger
became
apparent
repeat
that
it
is
not
for
me
to
teach
the
catechism
you
are
mistaken
you
are
not
at
the
school
of
the
brothers
of
the
christian
doctrine
who
make
the
catechism
the
basis
of
all
their
teaching
you
are
in
a
secular
republican
school
expressly
set
apart
from
all
the
churches
one
where
the
teaching
is
based
solely
on
reason
and
science
if
it
be
necessary
i
shall
appeal
on
the
subject
to
my
superiors
mauraisin
understood
that
he
had
gone
too
far
each
time
that
he
had
endeavoured
to
shake
marc
position
he
had
found
his
superior
academy
inspector
le
barazer
tacitly
passively
supporting
the
young
man
refusing
to
take
any
action
against
him
unless
grave
and
charges
were
brought
forward
moreover
mauraisin
knew
le
opinions
respecting
the
absolute
neutrality
of
the
schools
in
religious
matters
and
so
without
insisting
on
the
subject
he
curtailed
his
inspection
soon
bringing
it
to
an
end
though
not
without
again
indulging
in
criticisms
for
he
was
determined
to
find
nothing
satisfactory
the
boys
themselves
deemed
him
ridiculous
and
covertly
made
merry
over
the
bad
temper
of
that
vain
little
fop
whose
hair
and
beard
were
so
sprucely
kept
when
he
withdrew
mignot
went
so
far
as
to
shrug
his
shoulders
and
whisper
to
marc
shall
have
a
bad
report
but
you
were
quite
right
that
man
is
becoming
altogether
too
stupid
for
some
time
now
mignot
gained
upon
by
marc
firm
yet
gentle
behaviour
had
been
coming
over
to
his
side
it
was
not
that
he
as
yet
shared
his
opinions
in
all
things
for
he
was
still
anxious
respecting
his
own
advancement
but
he
had
a
sound
mind
at
bottom
and
was
gradually
yielding
to
the
other
good
guidance
a
bad
report
marc
repeated
gaily
wo
dare
to
venture
beyond
hypocritical
and
venomous
attacks
ah
do
you
see
him
going
into
mademoiselle
rouzaire
he
with
his
divinity
now
the
worst
is
that
his
behaviour
is
not
dictated
by
principle
but
merely
by
personal
policy
a
desire
to
make
his
way
in
the
world
at
each
inspection
mauraisin
lavished
very
favourable
reports
upon
mademoiselle
rouzaire
she
at
all
events
took
her
girls
to
church
compelled
them
to
recite
the
catechism
in
school
hours
and
allowed
the
inspector
to
question
them
about
religion
as
much
as
he
desired
one
of
her
pupils
little
hortense
savin
who
was
being
prepared
for
her
first
communion
quite
astonished
mauraisin
by
her
extensive
knowledge
of
bible
history
and
if
angèle
bongard
like
her
brother
showed
less
proficiency
in
spite
of
her
painfully
stubborn
efforts
to
learn
on
the
other
hand
lucile
doloir
a
little
lass
six
years
of
age
who
had
joined
the
school
only
recently
gave
promise
of
great
intelligence
and
would
make
later
on
a
very
charming
of
the
virgin
when
morning
lessons
were
over
marc
again
caught
sight
of
mauraisin
whom
mademoiselle
rouzaire
was
escorting
to
the
threshold
of
her
school
they
lingered
there
together
chatting
in
an
intimate
way
and
making
gestures
suggestive
of
great
distress
of
mind
they
were
undoubtedly
deploring
what
went
on
in
the
neighbouring
boys
school
which
was
still
in
the
hands
of
the
disgraceful
master
of
whom
for
two
years
they
had
been
vainly
trying
to
rid
the
town
after
long
expecting
the
sudden
removal
of
marc
maillebois
was
now
growing
accustomed
to
his
presence
at
a
sitting
of
the
municipal
council
mayor
darras
had
even
found
an
opportunity
to
praise
him
and
his
position
had
been
strengthened
recently
by
an
incident
of
considerable
significance
the
return
of
two
boys
who
had
been
previously
transferred
to
the
brothers
school
this
indicated
that
parents
felt
tranquillised
and
were
disposed
to
accept
the
young
man
and
it
was
also
a
check
for
the
congregational
school
hitherto
so
prosperous
and
victorious
was
marc
about
to
succeed
then
in
restoring
the
secular
school
to
honour
by
dint
of
wisdom
and
affection
as
he
had
said
to
salvan
anxiety
must
have
arisen
among
the
ignorantines
and
the
monks
the
whole
clerical
faction
for
the
young
man
suddenly
found
himself
attacked
in
so
singular
a
fashion
that
he
was
quite
surprised
mauraisin
on
calling
upon
the
mayor
and
others
had
left
the
catechism
question
on
one
side
speaking
only
of
marc
new
system
of
washing
the
schoolroom
floor
and
in
this
connection
affecting
much
alarm
for
the
children
health
a
great
controversy
arose
ought
the
floor
to
be
washed
or
ought
it
to
be
swept
before
long
maillebois
was
divided
into
two
camps
which
became
quite
impassioned
and
hurled
all
sorts
of
arguments
at
one
another
the
children
parents
were
consulted
and
savin
the
clerk
denounced
the
washing
system
so
bitterly
that
for
a
moment
it
was
thought
he
would
remove
his
twin
boys
from
the
school
but
marc
carried
the
question
to
a
higher
court
soliciting
the
opinion
of
his
superiors
and
requesting
them
to
appoint
a
commission
of
medical
men
and
hygienists
then
came
a
serious
investigation
and
victory
rested
with
the
washing
system
for
the
master
this
was
quite
a
triumph
the
children
parents
became
more
and
more
disposed
to
support
him
even
savin
with
whom
it
was
so
difficult
to
deal
had
to
retract
and
another
boy
came
back
from
the
brothers
school
which
people
began
to
say
was
horribly
dirty
but
in
spite
of
this
dawning
sympathy
marc
harboured
no
illusions
he
felt
that
years
would
be
necessary
to
free
the
region
from
the
poison
of
clericalism
gaining
a
little
more
ground
every
now
and
then
he
practised
the
greatest
prudence
well
pleased
with
the
result
however
slight
it
might
be
at
the
instance
of
geneviève
he
had
carried
his
desire
for
peace
so
far
as
to
renew
his
intercourse
with
her
relations
this
as
it
happened
took
place
in
connection
with
the
famous
washing
controversy
in
which
contrary
to
custom
the
ladies
shared
his
views
so
now
from
time
to
time
accompanying
his
wife
and
daughter
he
again
visited
the
little
house
on
the
place
des
capucins
the
two
old
ladies
remained
ceremonious
and
carefully
avoided
all
dangerous
subjects
of
conversation
thus
there
was
no
pleasant
intimacy
nevertheless
the
reconciliation
delighted
geneviève
for
it
freed
her
from
the
embarrassment
she
had
felt
when
calling
alone
on
her
grandmother
and
mother
at
present
she
saw
them
almost
daily
and
sometimes
left
louise
with
them
coming
and
going
from
one
house
to
the
other
marc
evincing
no
anxiety
but
feeling
indeed
well
pleased
with
the
gaiety
displayed
by
his
wife
on
whom
the
ladies
again
lavished
caresses
services
and
little
presents
one
sunday
on
going
to
lunch
with
a
friend
at
jonville
marc
by
the
force
of
contrast
suddenly
realised
how
much
ground
he
had
already
gained
at
maillebois
he
had
never
previously
understood
how
decisive
a
schoolmaster
influence
might
prove
whilst
maillebois
was
slowly
reverting
to
justice
health
and
prosperity
he
found
jonville
relapsing
into
darkness
poverty
and
stagnation
it
grieved
him
to
find
that
little
or
nothing
remained
of
the
good
work
he
had
done
there
in
former
years
and
this
was
due
solely
to
the
deplorable
action
of
the
new
schoolmaster
jauffre
who
cared
for
nothing
save
his
own
personal
success
short
dark
quick
and
cunning
with
narrow
prying
eyes
jauffre
owed
his
success
in
life
to
the
priest
of
his
native
village
who
had
taken
him
from
his
father
a
blacksmith
to
teach
him
his
first
lessons
later
on
another
priest
had
enriched
him
by
negotiating
his
marriage
with
a
butcher
daughter
who
was
short
and
dark
like
himself
and
who
brought
him
as
dowry
an
income
of
two
thousand
francs
a
year
jauffre
was
convinced
therefore
that
if
he
desired
to
become
a
personage
he
ought
to
remain
on
the
side
of
the
priests
who
some
day
doubtless
would
provide
him
with
a
splendid
position
the
income
he
owed
to
his
wife
already
rendered
him
respectable
and
his
superiors
treated
him
with
consideration
for
a
man
who
was
not
dependent
on
the
administration
for
his
living
could
hardly
be
hustled
about
as
if
he
were
a
mere
starveling
like
férou
in
the
school
world
as
elsewhere
favours
go
to
the
rich
never
to
the
poor
besides
exaggerated
reports
were
spread
respecting
jauffre
fortune
in
such
wise
that
all
the
peasants
took
off
their
hats
to
him
he
completing
his
conquest
of
them
by
his
greed
for
gain
his
wonderful
skill
in
extracting
as
much
profit
as
possible
from
everybody
and
everything
he
was
not
troubled
with
any
sincere
belief
if
he
were
a
republican
a
good
patriot
and
a
good
catholic
it
was
only
so
far
as
his
interests
required
thus
although
he
called
upon
abbé
cognasse
as
soon
as
he
was
appointed
to
jonville
he
did
not
immediately
hand
the
school
over
to
him
for
he
detected
the
spirit
then
prevalent
in
the
village
but
he
gradually
allowed
the
priest
to
become
by
intentional
relinquishment
of
his
own
privileges
and
by
covert
resistance
to
the
express
desires
of
the
mayor
and
the
parish
council
mayor
martineau
so
strong
and
firm
when
he
had
leant
on
marc
became
quite
lost
on
having
to
contend
against
the
new
schoolmaster
who
soon
became
the
real
ruler
of
the
parish
and
ended
by
relinquishing
his
authority
to
abbé
cognasse
in
such
wise
that
at
the
expiration
of
six
months
jonville
was
in
the
priest
hands
jauffre
line
of
conduct
interested
marc
particularly
because
it
was
a
masterpiece
of
jesuitry
he
obtained
precise
information
about
it
from
the
schoolmistress
mademoiselle
mazeline
on
whom
he
called
she
was
sincerely
grieved
at
being
unable
to
effect
anything
useful
now
that
she
remained
alone
in
a
parish
where
all
was
rotting
she
told
marc
of
the
comedy
played
by
jauffre
in
the
earlier
days
when
mayor
martineau
complained
of
one
or
another
encroachment
on
the
part
of
the
priest
which
the
schoolmaster
himself
had
stealthily
provoked
the
latter
pretended
to
be
as
indignant
as
the
mayor
and
accused
his
wife
madame
jauffre
who
was
very
devout
of
assisting
abbé
cognasse
as
it
happened
the
husband
and
the
wife
were
in
full
agreement
and
had
devised
this
plan
in
order
to
escape
responsibility
and
so
martineau
was
speedily
vanquished
particularly
as
his
coquettish
wife
became
the
great
friend
of
madame
jauffre
who
on
the
strength
of
her
dower
affected
the
manners
of
a
born
lady
before
long
jauffre
began
to
ring
the
bell
for
mass
a
duty
which
marc
had
always
refused
to
discharge
it
brought
in
only
thirty
francs
a
year
but
then
in
opinion
thirty
francs
were
not
to
be
sneezed
at
at
marc
instigation
the
money
had
been
devoted
for
a
time
to
the
repair
of
the
old
church
clock
and
now
the
latter
being
neglected
as
in
former
days
got
out
of
order
once
more
in
such
wise
that
the
peasants
never
again
knew
the
correct
time
for
the
clock
went
by
fits
and
starts
being
one
day
too
fast
and
another
too
slow
as
mademoiselle
mazeline
remarked
with
a
sad
smile
that
clock
was
the
image
of
the
parish
where
nothing
was
now
done
in
accordance
with
sense
and
logic
the
worst
was
that
abbé
cognasse
triumph
extended
to
le
moreux
whose
mayor
saleur
the
impressed
by
the
turn
which
things
were
taking
at
jonville
and
fearing
for
the
fat
life
which
he
led
thanks
to
his
new
wealth
went
back
to
the
church
however
little
he
might
really
like
the
priests
and
it
was
on
that
wretched
rebel
schoolmaster
férou
that
the
effects
of
the
reconciliation
fell
whenever
abbé
cognasse
now
came
to
le
moreux
he
displayed
a
most
insolent
sense
of
victory
and
inflicted
on
the
schoolmaster
all
sorts
of
humiliations
with
which
the
other
had
to
put
up
abandoned
as
he
was
by
the
mayor
and
the
parish
council
never
did
a
poor
man
lead
a
more
rageful
life
possessed
of
a
broad
quick
mind
but
condemned
to
live
among
so
much
ignorance
and
malice
férou
was
impelled
to
the
most
extreme
views
by
his
misery
his
wife
worn
out
by
hard
toil
and
his
three
poor
pale
and
puny
daughters
were
starving
yet
although
indebtedness
was
consuming
his
last
resources
he
did
not
submit
looking
more
of
a
scarecrow
than
ever
in
his
old
whitening
frock
coat
he
evinced
greater
and
greater
bitterness
not
only
refusing
to
take
his
pupils
to
mass
but
even
growling
insults
when
the
priest
went
by
on
sundays
a
catastrophe
was
imminent
dismissal
was
inevitable
and
to
make
matters
worse
as
the
unlucky
man
had
served
only
eight
of
his
ten
years
as
a
teacher
he
would
be
seized
by
the
military
authorities
immediately
after
his
dismissal
what
would
become
of
the
mournful
wife
and
little
girls
when
the
husband
the
father
should
be
lodged
in
some
barracks

on
leaving
jonville
that
day
marc
and
mademoiselle
mazeline
who
accompanied
him
as
far
as
the
railway
station
passed
the
church
at
the
moment
when
vespers
were
ending
palmyre
abbé
terrible
old
servant
stood
on
the
threshold
taking
stock
of
those
who
showed
themselves
good
christians
jauffre
came
out
and
two
of
his
pupils
saluted
him
in
military
fashion
a
mark
of
deference
which
he
exacted
and
which
flattered
his
patriotic
feelings
then
appeared
madame
jauffre
and
madame
martineau
martineau
himself
and
a
stream
of
peasants
of
both
sexes
marc
hastened
his
steps
in
order
to
avoid
recognition
and
an
impulse
to
express
his
grief
aloud
he
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
jonville
was
less
well
kept
than
formerly
signs
of
abandonment
of
a
diminution
of
prosperity
were
already
apparent
but
then
was
not
that
the
law
did
not
intellectual
poverty
engender
material
poverty
filth
and
vermin
have
invaded
every
country
where
roman
catholicism
has
triumphed
wherever
it
has
passed
it
has
proved
a
blast
of
death
striking
the
soil
with
sterility
casting
men
into
idleness
and
imbecility
for
it
is
the
very
negation
of
life
and
it
kills
nations
like
a
slow
but
deadly
poison
marc
felt
relieved
when
on
the
morrow
he
once
more
found
himself
in
his
school
at
maillebois
among
the
children
whose
minds
and
hearts
he
was
striving
to
awaken
doubtless
his
work
progressed
very
slowly
but
the
result
achieved
lent
him
the
strength
to
persevere
unfortunately
the
parents
of
his
boys
gave
him
no
help
his
advance
would
have
been
more
rapid
if
the
lads
had
found
in
their
homes
some
continuance
of
the
principles
inculcated
during
their
school
hours
but
the
contrary
happened
at
times
in
achille
and
philippe
savin
marc
detected
the
sullen
jealous
bitterness
of
their
father
and
he
could
only
endeavour
to
check
their
propensity
for
falsehood
slyness
and
again
though
the
doloirs
were
intelligent
enough
if
they
had
only
been
minded
to
learn
they
showed
little
real
improvement
auguste
was
very
inattentive
and
quarrelsome
and
charles
followed
in
his
elder
brother
footsteps
with
fernand
bongard
the
difficulty
was
different
he
was
exceptionally
obtuse
and
it
was
only
with
an
incredible
amount
of
trouble
that
one
could
make
him
understand
and
remember
the
slightest
thing
yet
there
was
some
improvement
among
the
boys
in
their
since
marc
had
brought
them
under
a
regimen
of
reason
and
truth
besides
the
young
man
did
not
hope
to
change
the
world
with
one
generation
of
schoolboys
the
elementary
master
task
requires
the
greatest
patience
and
abnegation
and
marc
one
desire
was
to
furnish
an
example
by
giving
his
whole
life
to
the
obscure
work
of
preparing
the
future
if
others
would
only
perform
their
duty
one
might
hope
that
in
three
or
four
generations
a
new
liberating
france
might
be
created
such
as
might
emancipate
the
world
and
the
young
man
was
ambitious
of
no
immediate
reward
no
personal
success
though
to
his
great
delight
he
did
receive
a
recompense
for
his
efforts
in
the
satisfaction
which
one
of
his
pupils
little
sébastien
milhomme
gave
him
that
gentle
and
remarkably
intelligent
lad
had
become
passionately
attached
to
truth
not
only
was
he
the
first
of
his
class
but
he
also
displayed
much
sincerity
and
uprightness
at
once
boyishly
and
charmingly
uncompromising
in
character
his
schoolfellows
often
chose
him
as
umpire
in
a
difficulty
and
when
he
had
pronounced
judgment
he
would
not
admit
that
any
should
free
themselves
from
the
effects
of
his
decision
marc
always
felt
happy
when
he
saw
sébastien
at
his
desk
with
his
long
and
somewhat
pensive
face
crowned
by
fair
and
curly
hair
and
lighted
by
fine
blue
eyes
which
fixed
on
the
master
with
an
ardent
desire
to
learn
drank
in
every
lesson
and
it
was
not
only
sébastien
rapid
progress
which
won
marc
heart
he
was
still
fonder
of
the
boy
on
account
of
all
the
good
and
generous
qualities
which
he
divined
in
him
indeed
sébastien
was
an
exquisite
little
nature
which
marc
took
pleasure
in
wakening
one
of
those
in
which
all
the
florescence
of
noble
thoughts
and
noble
deeds
was
beginning
to
bud
a
painful
scene
occurred
one
day
towards
the
close
of
the
afternoon
lessons
fernand
bongard
whom
others
were
fond
of
teasing
on
account
of
his
dense
stupidity
had
discovered
that
the
peak
of
his
cap
had
been
torn
off
forthwith
he
had
burst
into
tears
declaring
that
his
mother
would
surely
beat
him
marc
wished
to
discover
the
author
of
this
malicious
act
but
all
the
boys
laughingly
denied
their
guilt
auguste
doloir
more
impudently
even
than
the
others
though
there
was
reason
to
suspect
that
the
misdeed
was
his
work
and
indeed
as
it
was
proposed
to
keep
the
whole
school
in
after
lessons
until
the
culprit
should
confess
achille
savin
betrayed
auguste
by
pulling
the
peak
of
fernand
cap
out
of
his
pocket
this
gave
marc
an
opportunity
to
denounce
falsehood
and
he
did
so
with
so
much
warmth
that
the
culprit
himself
shed
tears
and
asked
forgiveness
but
sébastien
emotion
was
extraordinary
and
when
the
others
departed
he
lingered
in
the
empty
schoolroom
looking
at
his
master
with
a
desperate
expression
in
his
eyes
you
something
to
say
to
me
my
boy
marc
asked
him
monsieur
sébastien
replied
yet
he
became
silent
his
lips
trembling
and
his
handsome
face
flushing
with
confusion
it
very
difficult
to
say
then
marc
inquired
monsieur
it
a
falsehood
which
i
told
you
and
which
makes
me
feel
very
unhappy
the
young
master
smiled
anticipating
some
peccadillo
some
childishly
exaggerated
scruple
of
conscience
tell
me
the
truth
he
said
will
relieve
you
another
pause
of
some
length
followed
signs
of
a
fresh
mental
battle
became
apparent
in
sébastien
limpid
blue
eyes
and
even
on
his
pure
lips
but
at
last
the
boy
made
up
his
mind
and
said
monsieur
i
told
you
a
falsehood
a
long
time
ago
when
i
was
quite
little
and
ignorant
i
told
you
a
falsehood
by
saying
what
was
not
true
that
i
had
never
seen
my
cousin
victor
with
that
writing
copy
you
remember
monsieur
the
copy
which
people
talked
about
so
much
he
had
given
it
to
me
as
he
did
not
want
to
keep
it
himself
for
he
felt
anxious
about
it
as
he
had
taken
it
from
the
brothers
and
on
that
very
day
when
i
told
you
i
did
not
remember
anything
about
it
i
had
hidden
it
in
a
copybook
of
my
own
marc
listened
thunderstruck
once
more
the
whole
simon
case
seemed
to
arise
before
him
emerging
from
its
apparent
slumber
but
he
did
not
wish
the
lad
to
see
how
deeply
he
was
stirred
by
the
unexpected
shock
and
so
he
asked
him
you
sure
that
you
are
not
again
mistaken
did
the
copy
bear
the
words
vous
les
uns
les
monsieur
there
was
a
paraph
down
below
i
have
taught
you
what
a
paraph
is
have
i
not
monsieur
for
a
moment
marc
relapsed
into
silence
his
heart
was
beating
violently
he
feared
lest
the
cry
which
was
rising
to
his
lips
might
escape
him
then
wishing
to
make
quite
sure
he
continued
why
did
you
keep
silent
till
now
my
lad
and
what
induced
you
to
tell
me
the
truth
this
evening
sébastien
already
relieved
looked
his
master
straight
in
the
face
with
an
expression
of
charming
candour
his
delicate
smile
returned
and
he
explained
the
wakening
of
his
conscience
in
the
simplest
way
if
i
did
not
tell
you
the
truth
sooner
monsieur
it
was
because
i
felt
no
need
of
doing
so
i
no
longer
remembered
that
i
had
told
you
a
falsehood
it
was
so
long
ago
but
one
day
here
you
explained
to
us
how
wrong
it
was
to
tell
falsehoods
and
then
i
remembered
it
and
began
to
feel
worried
afterwards
every
time
you
spoke
of
the
happiness
one
found
in
always
saying
the
truth
i
felt
the
more
worried
because
i
had
not
said
it
to
you
and
it
pained
me
so
i
could
bear
it
any
longer
and
i
had
to
tell
you
emotion
brought
tears
to
marc
eyes
so
his
lessons
were
already
flowering
in
that
little
mind
and
it
was
he
who
garnered
that
first
harvest
a
harvest
of
truth
such
precious
truth
too
which
would
perhaps
enable
him
to
bring
about
a
little
justice
never
had
he
hoped
for
so
prompt
and
so
sweet
a
reward
the
emotion
he
felt
was
exquisite
with
an
impulse
of
tender
affection
he
stooped
and
kissed
the
lad
you
my
little
sébastien
you
have
given
me
great
pleasure
and
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
emotion
had
come
upon
the
boy
also
i
love
you
very
much
monsieur
he
answered
otherwise
i
should
not
have
dared
to
tell
you
everything
marc
resisted
his
desire
to
question
the
boy
fully
for
he
feared
lest
he
might
be
accused
of
having
abused
his
authority
as
master
to
aggravate
the
confession
he
merely
ascertained
that
madame
alexandre
had
taken
the
from
her
son
who
did
not
know
what
she
had
done
with
it
for
she
had
never
again
mentioned
it
to
him
for
the
rest
the
young
man
preferred
to
see
the
mother
she
alone
could
produce
the
slip
if
it
were
still
in
her
possession
and
what
a
precious
document
it
would
prove
for
would
it
not
constitute
the
fact
which
might
enable
simon
family
to
apply
for
the
revision
of
his
iniquitous
trial
on
remaining
alone
marc
felt
full
of
joy
he
wished
it
were
possible
for
him
to
hasten
to
the
lehmanns
immediately
to
tell
them
the
good
news
and
impart
a
little
happiness
to
their
sad
mourning
home
which
was
the
object
of
so
much
popular
execration
at
last
at
last
a
sunray
had
flashed
upon
the
black
night
of
iniquity
going
upstairs
to
join
his
wife
he
cried
to
her
as
he
reached
the
threshold
such
was
his
excitement
his
craving
to
relieve
his
heart
do
you
know
i
now
have
proof
of
simon
innocence
ah
justice
is
wakening
we
shall
be
able
to
go
forward
now
he
had
not
noticed
the
presence
in
a
shadowy
corner
of
madame
duparque
who
since
the
reconciliation
condescended
to
visit
her
granddaughter
occasionally
she
on
hearing
him
gave
a
start
and
exclaimed
in
her
harsh
voice
simon
innocence
do
you
still
persevere
in
your
folly
then
a
proof
indeed
what
proof
do
you
mean
then
after
he
had
related
his
conversation
with
little
milhomme
the
old
lady
again
flew
into
a
temper
evidence
of
a
child
that
of
much
value
he
now
pretends
that
he
formerly
lied
but
what
proof
is
there
that
he
is
not
lying
now
so
the
culprit
would
be
a
brother
eh
oh
speak
your
mind
plainly
acknowledge
it
your
only
object
is
to
accuse
one
of
the
brothers
is
that
not
so
it
is
always
the
same
rageful
impiety
with
you
somewhat
disconcerted
at
having
thus
come
upon
the
old
lady
and
wishing
to
spare
his
wife
the
grief
of
any
fresh
rupture
marc
contented
himself
with
saying
wo
discuss
things
with
you
grandmother
i
merely
wished
to
inform
geneviève
of
some
news
which
was
likely
to
please
her
your
news
does
not
please
her
cried
madame
duparque
at
her
marc
turned
towards
his
wife
who
stood
there
in
the
fading
light
which
fell
from
the
window
and
indeed
to
his
surprise
he
saw
that
she
was
grave
that
her
beautiful
eyes
had
darkened
as
if
the
night
now
slowly
approaching
had
filled
them
with
shadows
it
true
geneviève
he
asked
her
a
work
of
justice
no
longer
please
you
she
did
not
answer
him
at
once
she
had
become
pale
and
embarrassed
as
if
tortured
by
painful
hesitation
and
just
as
he
likewise
feeling
very
uneasy
was
repeating
his
question
she
was
saved
the
distress
of
answering
him
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
madame
alexandre
sébastien
on
returning
home
had
bravely
told
his
mother
of
his
confession
respecting
the
she
had
lacked
the
strength
to
scold
him
for
his
good
action
but
full
of
fear
at
the
thought
that
the
schoolmaster
would
call
question
her
and
demand
the
document
in
the
presence
of
her
terrible
madame
edouard
who
was
so
anxious
for
the
prosperity
of
their
little
stationery
business
she
had
preferred
to
go
to
the
school
and
do
what
she
could
to
bury
the
affair
at
once
yet
now
she
was
there
her
discomfort
became
great
indeed
like
a
gust
of
wind
she
had
darted
out
of
her
shop
hardly
knowing
what
she
would
say
and
at
present
she
remained
stammering
full
of
embarrassment
particularly
as
she
perceived
geneviève
and
madame
duparque
with
marc
whom
she
had
hoped
to
see
privately
alone
froment
she
began
has
just
told
me
yes
of
that
confession
he
thought
fit
to
make
to
you
so
i
deemed
it
best
to
give
you
the
reasons
of
my
conduct
you
understand
do
you
not
all
the
worry
which
such
a
story
would
bring
us
with
the
difficulties
that
already
beset
us
in
our
business
well
the
fact
is
it
true
i
did
have
that
paper
but
it
no
longer
exists
i
destroyed
it
she
breathed
again
as
if
relieved
having
contrived
to
say
what
she
considered
necessary
in
order
to
be
freed
from
trouble
destroyed
it
marc
exclaimed
with
a
pang
madame
alexandre
some
slight
embarrassment
returned
to
her
and
she
once
more
sought
her
words
did
wrong
perhaps
but
think
of
our
position
we
are
two
poor
women
with
nobody
to
assist
us
and
besides
it
was
so
sad
to
have
our
children
mixed
up
in
that
abominable
affair
i
could
not
keep
a
paper
which
prevented
me
from
sleeping
i
burnt
it
she
was
still
quivering
so
perceptibly
that
marc
looked
at
her
as
she
stood
there
tall
and
fair
with
the
gentle
face
of
a
woman
of
loving
nature
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
experiencing
some
secret
torment
for
a
moment
he
felt
suspicious
wondered
if
she
were
lying
and
it
occurred
to
him
to
test
her
sincerity
destroying
that
paper
madame
alexandre
he
said
condemned
an
innocent
man
a
second
time
think
of
all
that
he
is
suffering
yonder
you
would
weep
if
i
read
his
letters
to
you
there
can
be
no
worse
torture
than
his
the
deadly
climate
the
harshness
of
his
keepers
and
above
all
else
the
consciousness
of
his
innocence
and
the
fearful
obscurity
as
to
the
truth
amid
which
he
is
struggling
and
and
what
a
frightful
nightmare
for
you
should
you
remember
that
all
this
is
your
work
she
had
become
quite
white
and
her
hands
moved
involuntarily
as
if
to
ward
off
some
horrible
vision
there
was
kindness
and
weakness
in
her
nature
but
marc
could
not
tell
whether
it
were
a
quiver
of
remorse
or
some
desperate
struggle
that
he
detected
in
her
for
a
moment
as
if
imploring
help
she
stammered
wildly
poor
child
my
poor
child
and
that
child
that
little
sébastien
to
whom
she
was
so
fondly
so
passionately
attached
to
whom
she
would
have
sacrificed
everything
must
have
suddenly
appeared
before
her
and
have
restored
some
little
of
her
strength
you
are
cruel
monsieur
froment
she
said
make
me
terribly
unhappy
but
how
can
it
be
helped
since
it
done
i
can
not
find
that
paper
again
among
the
ashes
you
burnt
it
madame
alexandre
you
are
sure
of
it
i
told
you
so
i
burnt
it
for
fear
lest
my
little
man
should
be
compromised
and
suffer
from
it
all
his
life
she
spoke
those
last
words
in
an
ardent
voice
as
if
with
fierce
resolution
marc
was
convinced
and
made
a
gesture
of
despair
once
again
the
triumph
of
truth
was
delayed
prevented
without
a
word
he
escorted
madame
alexandre
to
the
door
she
again
becoming
all
embarrassment
at
a
loss
indeed
how
to
take
leave
of
the
ladies
who
were
present
bowing
and
stammering
excuses
she
disappeared
and
when
she
was
gone
deep
silence
reigned
in
the
room
neither
geneviève
nor
madame
duparque
had
intervened
both
had
remained
frigid
and
motionless
and
they
still
preserved
silence
while
marc
absorbed
in
his
grief
his
head
bowed
walked
slowly
to
and
fro
at
last
however
madame
duparque
rose
to
take
her
departure
and
on
reaching
the
threshold
she
turned
and
said
woman
is
a
lunatic
her
story
of
a
destroyed
paper
appears
to
me
to
be
a
fairy
tale
which
nobody
would
believe
you
would
do
wrong
to
relate
it
for
it
would
not
help
on
your
affairs
be
sensible
marc
did
not
even
answer
with
a
heavy
tread
he
long
continued
walking
up
and
down
night
had
gathered
round
and
geneviève
lighted
the
lamp
and
when
by
its
pale
glow
she
began
to
lay
the
table
in
silence
her
husband
did
not
even
try
to
confess
her
one
sorrow
was
enough
and
he
did
not
wish
to
hasten
the
advent
of
another
such
as
would
come
should
he
learn
as
he
might
that
she
his
wife
was
no
longer
in
communion
with
him
in
respect
to
many
things
but
during
the
following
days
he
was
haunted
by
madame
duparque
last
words
supposing
indeed
that
he
should
try
to
make
use
of
the
new
fact
which
had
come
to
his
knowledge
what
credit
would
his
statement
obtain
among
the
public
doubtless
he
would
secure
the
testimony
of
sébastien
the
boy
would
repeat
that
he
had
seen
the
which
his
cousin
victor
had
brought
from
the
brothers
school
but
it
would
be
the
testimony
of
a
child
barely
ten
years
old
and
his
mother
would
strive
to
weaken
its
importance
it
was
the
paper
itself
that
ought
to
be
produced
and
the
statement
that
it
had
been
burnt
would
merely
lead
to
the
affair
being
buried
once
again
the
more
marc
reflected
the
more
he
understood
the
necessity
of
waiting
the
new
fact
could
not
be
put
to
use
given
the
conditions
in
which
he
had
discovered
it
and
yet
for
him
how
precious
it
was
how
fertile
in
decisive
proof
it
rendered
his
faith
in
innocence
unshakable
it
confirmed
all
his
deductions
materialised
the
conviction
to
which
reasoning
had
brought
him
one
of
the
brothers
was
the
real
culprit
a
legally
conducted
inquiry
would
soon
have
shown
which
of
them
it
was
yet
the
young
man
again
had
to
resign
himself
to
patience
and
rely
on
the
strength
of
truth
which
was
now
at
last
on
the
march
and
which
would
never
more
be
stopped
until
full
light
should
be
cast
upon
everything
at
the
same
time
marc
anguish
increased
the
torture
of
his
conscience
became
more
tragical
day
by
day
it
was
frightful
to
know
that
an
innocent
man
was
suffering
abominable
martyrdom
in
a
penal
settlement
and
that
the
real
culprit
was
free
near
at
hand
impudent
and
triumphant
still
pursuing
his
vile
work
as
a
corrupter
of
children
and
it
was
still
more
frightful
that
one
should
be
unable
to
cry
all
that
aloud
and
prove
it
confronted
as
one
was
by
the
base
complicity
of
all
the
social
forces
banded
together
by
egotistical
interest
to
perpetuate
the
monstrous
iniquity
marc
no
longer
slept
he
carried
his
secret
with
him
like
a
sharp
goad
which
incessantly
reminded
him
that
it
was
his
duty
to
ensure
justice
never
for
an
hour
did
he
cease
to
think
of
his
mission
and
his
heart
bled
despairingly
because
he
knew
not
what
to
do
to
hasten
its
success
even
at
the
lehmanns
he
said
nothing
of
sébastien
confession
what
good
would
it
have
done
to
give
these
poor
folk
a
vague
uncertain
hope
life
still
treated
them
very
harshly
overwhelmed
them
with
opprobrium
and
grief
grief
for
the
prisoner
yonder
whose
letters
rent
their
hearts
and
whose
name
was
cast
in
their
teeth
as
a
supreme
insult
old
lehmann
trade
had
declined
yet
more
rachel
always
gowned
in
mourning
like
a
widow
distressed
by
the
rapid
growth
of
her
children
who
would
learn
everything
before
long
scarcely
dared
to
go
out
thus
marc
only
confided
in
david
in
whom
glowed
the
stubborn
determination
to
make
everybody
recognise
and
acclaim
his
innocence
at
some
future
time
he
lived
apart
ignored
carefully
avoiding
all
appearance
on
the
scene
but
never
not
for
an
hour
did
he
pause
in
the
task
of
rehabilitation
which
had
become
the
sole
object
of
his
life
he
reflected
studied
followed
clues
which
he
too
often
had
to
abandon
after
a
few
steps
despite
two
years
of
constant
research
he
had
discovered
nothing
decisive
his
suspicion
of
an
illegal
communication
made
by
president
gragnon
to
the
jurors
had
become
a
moral
certainty
only
he
had
failed
in
all
his
efforts
to
procure
proof
and
could
not
tell
how
to
obtain
it
nevertheless
he
was
not
discouraged
he
had
resolved
to
devote
ten
twenty
years
of
his
life
even
to
reach
the
real
culprit
marc
revelation
inspired
him
with
additional
courage
and
patience
he
likewise
held
that
it
was
best
to
keep
sébastien
confession
secret
so
long
as
it
was
not
strengthened
by
some
material
proof
for
the
moment
it
merely
supplied
the
hope
of
an
additional
triumph
and
that
said
david
again
turned
calmly
and
firmly
to
his
investigations
pursuing
them
with
no
haste
but
ever
in
the
same
prudent
continuous
manner
one
morning
before
lessons
began
marc
at
last
made
up
his
mind
to
remove
the
large
crucifix
which
hitherto
he
had
left
hanging
from
the
wall
behind
his
desk
he
had
been
waiting
for
two
years
to
be
sufficiently
master
of
the
situation
before
expressing
in
this
manner
the
independence
of
the
secular
school
such
as
he
understood
and
desired
it
in
matters
of
religion
until
now
he
had
willingly
yielded
to
salvan
prudent
advice
for
he
understood
that
he
must
assure
himself
of
his
position
before
making
it
a
position
of
combat
but
he
now
felt
strong
enough
to
begin
the
battle
had
he
not
restored
prosperity
to
the
communal
school
by
winning
back
to
it
numerous
pupils
who
had
been
transferred
to
the
brothers
had
he
not
gradually
gained
personal
respect
the
affection
of
the
children
the
favour
of
their
parents
besides
he
was
impelled
to
take
action
first
by
his
recent
visit
to
jonville
which
he
had
left
on
the
high
road
to
knowledge
and
which
abbé
cognasse
was
once
more
transforming
into
an
abode
of
darkness
and
secondly
by
all
the
anxiety
and
anger
stirred
up
within
him
by
sébastien
confession
anger
with
the
ignominy
that
he
divined
around
him
in
maillebois
which
was
enslaved
and
poisoned
by
the
clerical
faction
that
morning
then
he
had
already
climbed
upon
a
stool
to
remove
the
crucifix
when
geneviève
holding
little
louise
by
the
hand
entered
the
classroom
to
inform
him
of
her
intention
to
take
the
child
to
spend
the
day
with
her
grandmother
at
the
sight
of
marc
on
the
stool
the
young
woman
was
quite
surprised
are
you
doing
there
she
asked
him
you
see
he
answered
am
taking
down
this
crucifix
which
i
intend
to
give
to
abbé
quandieu
myself
in
order
that
he
may
restore
it
to
the
church
which
it
ought
never
to
have
left
here
help
me
take
it
but
she
did
not
hold
out
her
arms
she
did
not
move
turning
extremely
pale
she
watched
him
as
if
she
were
witnessing
some
forbidden
and
dangerous
deed
which
filled
her
with
fear
and
he
had
to
descend
from
the
stool
unhelped
by
her
encumbered
with
the
big
crucifix
which
he
immediately
locked
up
in
one
of
the
cupboards
would
help
me
he
exclaimed
is
the
matter
do
you
disapprove
of
what
i
have
done
in
spite
of
her
emotion
geneviève
answered
plainly
i
disapprove
of
it
her
answer
amazed
marc
like
her
he
began
to
quiver
it
was
the
first
time
that
she
assumed
such
an
aggressive
and
angry
tone
with
him
he
felt
a
little
shock
a
slight
rending
such
as
presages
rupture
and
he
looked
at
her
with
astonishment
and
anxiety
as
if
he
had
heard
a
voice
he
did
not
know
as
if
a
stranger
had
just
spoken
to
him
you
disapprove
of
what
i
do
was
it
really
you
who
said
that
it
was
i
it
is
wrong
of
you
to
do
what
you
have
done
she
it
was
indeed
for
she
stood
before
him
tall
and
slender
with
her
fair
amiable
face
and
her
glance
gleaming
with
some
of
her
sensual
passion
yes
it
was
she
and
yet
in
the
expression
of
those
large
blue
eyes
there
was
already
something
different
a
shadow
a
little
of
the
mystical
dimness
of
the
and
marc
in
his
astonishment
felt
a
chill
come
to
his
heart
as
he
suddenly
observed
that
change
what
had
happened
then
why
was
she
no
longer
the
same
but
he
recoiled
from
an
immediate
explanation
and
contented
himself
with
adding
even
when
you
did
not
think
perhaps
as
i
did
you
always
told
me
to
act
in
accordance
with
my
conscience
and
that
is
what
i
have
now
done
and
so
your
blame
surprised
me
painfully
we
shall
have
to
talk
of
it
she
did
not
disarm
she
preserved
her
angry
frigidity
of
manner
will
talk
of
it
if
you
so
desire
she
replied
i
am
going
to
take
louise
to
grandmother
who
will
not
bring
her
back
till
this
evening
sudden
enlightenment
dawned
upon
marc
it
was
madame
duparque
who
was
taking
geneviève
from
him
and
who
doubtless
would
take
louise
also
he
had
acted
wrongly
in
disinteresting
himself
from
his
wife
doings
in
allowing
her
and
the
child
to
spend
so
much
time
in
that
pious
house
where
the
dimness
and
atmosphere
of
a
chapel
prevailed
he
had
failed
to
notice
the
stealthy
change
which
had
been
taking
place
in
his
wife
during
the
last
two
years
that
revival
of
her
pious
youth
of
the
indelible
education
of
other
days
which
little
by
little
had
been
bringing
her
back
to
the
dogmas
which
he
imagined
had
been
overcome
by
the
efforts
of
his
intellect
and
the
embrace
of
his
love
as
yet
she
had
not
begun
to
follow
her
religion
again
by
attendance
at
mass
communion
and
confession
but
he
felt
that
she
was
already
parting
from
him
reverting
to
the
past
with
slow
but
certain
steps
each
of
which
would
place
them
farther
and
farther
asunder
we
no
longer
in
agreement
then
my
darling
he
asked
her
sadly
with
great
frankness
she
replied
and
grandmother
was
right
marc
all
the
trouble
has
come
from
that
horrible
affair
since
you
have
been
defending
that
man
who
was
transported
and
who
deserved
his
punishment
misfortune
has
entered
our
home
and
we
shall
end
by
agreeing
no
more
in
anything
he
raised
a
cry
of
despair
it
you
he
repeated
who
speak
like
that
you
are
against
truth
against
justice
now
am
against
the
deluded
and
malicious
ones
whose
evil
passions
attack
religion
they
wish
to
destroy
god
but
even
if
one
quits
the
church
one
should
at
least
respect
its
ministers
who
do
so
much
good
this
time
marc
made
no
rejoinder
a
quarrel
was
out
of
place
at
that
moment
when
he
was
expecting
the
arrival
of
the
boys
but
was
the
evil
so
deep
already
his
grief
arose
chiefly
from
the
fact
that
at
the
root
of
the
dissentiment
parting
him
from
his
wife
he
found
the
simon
affair
the
mission
of
equity
which
he
had
imposed
on
himself
no
concession
in
that
matter
was
possible
on
his
part
and
thus
no
agreement
could
be
arrived
at
for
two
years
past
that
monstrous
affair
had
been
mingled
with
every
incident
it
was
like
a
poisoned
source
which
would
continue
to
rot
both
people
and
things
so
long
as
justice
was
not
done
and
now
his
own
home
was
poisoned
by
it
seeing
that
he
preserved
silence
geneviève
went
towards
the
door
repeating
quietly
i
am
going
to
grandmother
with
louise
marc
thereupon
caught
up
the
child
as
if
anxious
to
kiss
her
would
he
also
allow
that
little
one
the
flesh
of
his
flesh
to
be
taken
from
him
ought
he
not
to
keep
her
in
his
arms
to
save
her
from
imbecile
and
deadly
contagion
for
a
moment
he
looked
at
her
already
at
five
years
of
age
she
showed
signs
of
becoming
tall
and
slender
like
her
mother
her
grandmother
and
her
but
she
lacked
their
pale
fair
hair
and
she
had
the
lofty
brow
of
the
froments
the
brow
that
suggested
an
impregnable
tower
of
sense
and
knowledge
laughing
loudly
she
cast
her
arms
prettily
about
her
father
neck
know
papa
i
will
repeat
my
fable
to
you
when
i
come
home
i
know
it
quite
well
yielding
to
a
sentiment
of
tolerance
marc
for
the
second
time
resolved
that
he
would
have
no
dispute
he
restored
the
little
one
to
her
mother
who
led
her
away
moreover
the
boys
were
now
arriving
and
the
classroom
soon
became
full
but
anxiety
remained
in
the
master
heart
at
the
thought
of
the
struggle
which
he
had
resolved
to
wage
when
he
removed
the
crucifix
from
the
wall
that
struggle
it
was
now
certain
would
reach
his
own
hearth
his
tears
and
the
tears
of
his
loved
ones
would
flow
nevertheless
by
an
heroic
effort
he
mastered
his
suffering
and
summoning
little
sébastien
the
monitor
he
bade
him
watch
over
the
reading
class
while
for
his
part
he
gaily
proceeded
with
some
demonstrations
on
the
blackboard
amidst
the
joyous
brightness
with
which
the
sunshine
flooded
the
schoolroom
ii
three
days
later
in
the
evening
while
marc
was
undressing
in
the
bedroom
geneviève
being
already
in
bed
he
told
her
that
he
had
received
an
urgent
letter
from
salvan
who
wished
to
see
him
on
the
morrow
sunday
doubt
it
is
about
that
crucifix
which
i
removed
from
the
classroom
the
young
man
added
parents
have
complained
it
seems
and
very
likely
there
will
be
a
great
but
i
anticipated
it
geneviève
whose
head
lay
deep
in
her
pillow
returned
no
answer
but
when
marc
was
in
bed
and
the
light
was
extinguished
he
was
delightfully
surprised
to
find
her
casting
her
arms
about
him
and
whispering
in
his
ear
spoke
to
you
harshly
the
other
day
and
true
i
do
think
as
you
do
about
religion
or
about
the
affair
but
i
still
love
you
very
dearly
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
marc
felt
the
more
moved
by
these
words
as
since
the
recent
dispute
his
wife
had
turned
her
back
upon
him
as
though
in
token
of
conjugal
rupture
as
you
are
going
to
have
trouble
she
continued
softly
want
you
to
think
me
angry
one
ideas
may
differ
but
all
the
same
one
may
love
one
another
very
much
is
it
not
so
and
if
you
are
mine
i
am
still
yours
my
dear
dear
husband
on
hearing
her
speak
like
that
he
clasped
her
to
him
with
passionate
eagerness
my
dear
wife
as
long
as
you
love
me
as
long
as
you
are
mine
said
he
shall
fear
nought
of
the
terrible
threats
around
us
she
yielded
to
his
embrace
quivering
transported
by
the
joy
of
love
which
was
essential
to
her
being
and
there
came
a
moment
of
perfect
communion
irresistible
reconciliation
the
good
understanding
of
a
young
couple
united
by
love
is
only
seriously
threatened
when
some
divergency
of
that
love
arises
as
long
as
they
are
swayed
by
passion
one
for
the
other
they
remain
in
agreement
athwart
the
worst
mishaps
he
who
would
part
them
must
first
of
all
destroy
their
mutual
passion
when
marc
gave
geneviève
a
last
kiss
before
both
fell
asleep
he
thought
it
well
to
reassure
her
shall
act
very
prudently
in
this
affair
i
promise
you
said
he
know
too
that
i
am
moderate
and
reasonable
at
bottom
do
as
you
please
she
answered
prettily
i
ask
is
that
you
should
come
back
to
me
and
that
we
should
still
love
each
other
on
the
morrow
the
young
man
repaired
to
beaumont
quite
enlivened
by
his
wife
ardent
affection
he
derived
fresh
courage
from
it
and
thus
it
was
with
a
smiling
face
and
the
demeanour
of
a
combatant
that
he
entered
salvan
private
room
at
the
training
college
but
the
first
words
spoken
by
the
director
after
they
had
shaken
hands
in
a
friendly
way
surprised
and
embarrassed
him
say
my
good
fellow
salvan
began
it
seems
that
you
have
at
last
discovered
the
new
fact
the
proof
of
our
poor
innocence
which
will
enable
one
to
apply
for
the
revision
of
his
trial
marc
who
had
anticipated
an
immediate
explanation
on
the
subject
of
the
crucifix
remained
for
a
moment
silent
wondering
whether
he
ought
to
tell
the
truth
even
to
salvan
at
last
seeking
his
words
he
said
slowly
new
fact
no
i
have
nothing
decisive
as
yet
but
salvan
did
not
notice
his
hesitation
is
what
i
thought
he
rejoined
you
would
have
warned
me
eh
nevertheless
there
is
a
rumour
of
some
discovery
made
by
you
a
document
of
capital
importance
placed
in
your
hands
by
chance
something
like
a
sword
of
damocles
which
you
are
said
to
hold
over
the
heads
of
the
real
culprit
and
his
accomplices
the
whole
clerical
gang
of
the
region
marc
listened
full
of
stupefaction
who
could
have
spoken
how
was
it
that
sébastien
confession
and
his
mother
visit
had
become
known
how
was
it
that
particulars
had
been
spread
abroad
modified
and
exaggerated
as
they
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
the
young
man
suddenly
made
up
his
mind
to
tell
the
truth
to
salvan
he
felt
it
necessary
to
confide
in
that
worthy
and
sensible
friend
and
adviser
on
whom
he
placed
so
much
reliance
so
he
told
him
how
he
knew
that
a
similar
to
the
one
brought
forward
in
evidence
against
simon
had
been
taken
from
the
brothers
school
and
how
it
had
been
destroyed
salvan
who
was
deeply
moved
rose
from
his
chair
was
the
proof
we
needed
he
exclaimed
you
act
rightly
in
remaining
silent
since
we
hold
no
material
evidence
one
must
wait
at
present
however
i
understand
the
disquietude
the
covert
alarm
which
for
some
days
past
i
have
detected
among
our
adversaries
some
words
may
have
escaped
you
or
the
boy
or
his
mother
and
chance
words
often
go
far
or
else
some
mysterious
agency
may
have
placed
the
secret
in
circulation
misrepresenting
the
facts
in
any
case
the
culprit
and
his
accomplices
have
certainly
felt
the
ground
quaking
beneath
them
and
naturally
they
are
alarmed
for
they
will
have
to
defend
their
crime
then
passing
to
the
subject
which
had
prompted
his
urgent
letter
he
resumed
i
wished
to
speak
to
you
of
another
incident
which
everybody
is
talking
about
your
removal
of
that
crucifix
from
your
classroom
you
know
my
views
our
schools
ought
to
be
purely
and
simply
secular
therefore
all
religious
symbols
are
out
of
place
in
them
but
you
can
have
no
idea
of
the
tempest
which
your
action
will
raise
unfortunately
it
is
now
the
interest
of
the
good
brothers
and
their
supporters
the
jesuits
to
ruin
you
absolutely
alarmed
as
they
are
by
the
weapons
which
they
believe
to
be
in
your
hands
by
your
action
in
the
matter
of
the
crucifix
you
have
laid
yourself
open
to
attack
and
so
they
are
naturally
rushing
forward
to
the
onslaught
marc
understood
and
made
a
gesture
of
defiance
like
a
man
fully
prepared
for
battle
have
i
not
acted
prudently
in
accordance
with
your
advice
he
responded
i
not
wait
two
long
years
before
removing
that
cross
which
was
hung
up
after
simon
trial
to
indicate
that
the
clerical
faction
had
virtually
taken
possession
of
the
communal
school
i
have
set
that
poor
school
on
its
legs
again
it
was
suspected
and
discredited
and
i
have
made
it
prosperous
and
free
so
was
it
not
legitimate
that
my
first
independent
act
as
schoolmaster
after
winning
acceptance
and
then
victory
should
be
to
rid
the
school
of
all
emblems
and
restore
it
to
that
neutrality
in
matters
of
religion
from
which
it
ought
never
to
have
departed
salvan
interrupted
him
again
i
do
not
blame
you
you
showed
great
patience
and
tolerance
nevertheless
your
action
has
taken
place
at
a
terrible
moment
and
feeling
alarmed
for
you
i
wished
to
discuss
matters
in
order
to
provide
if
possible
for
all
dangerous
contingencies
they
sat
down
and
talked
at
length
the
political
situation
of
the
department
was
still
very
bad
fresh
elections
had
taken
place
recently
and
the
result
had
been
another
step
in
the
direction
of
clerical
reaction
an
extraordinary
thing
had
happened
lemarrois
the
mayor
of
beaumont
gambetta
former
friend
whose
position
as
deputy
had
been
deemed
unassailable
had
found
himself
obliged
to
submit
to
a
second
ballot
through
the
advent
of
a
socialist
candidate
none
other
than
advocate
delbos
whose
address
at
simon
trial
had
marked
him
out
for
the
support
of
the
revolutionary
and
at
the
second
polling
lemarrois
had
only
won
by
a
majority
of
about
a
thousand
votes
meanwhile
the
royalist
and
catholic
reactionaries
had
gained
a
seat
the
handsome
hector
de
sanglebœuf
having
secured
the
return
of
a
friend
a
general
officer
thanks
to
the
entertainments
which
he
gave
at
la
désirade
and
the
lavish
manner
in
which
he
distributed
jew
gold
derived
from
his
baron
nathan
then
too
in
order
to
secure
the
amiable
marcilly
once
the
hope
of
all
the
young
men
of
culture
had
skilfully
completed
his
evolution
towards
the
welcoming
church
which
was
very
desirous
of
concluding
a
new
pact
with
the
whom
the
progress
of
socialism
terrified
footnote
in
french
elections
when
several
nominees
contest
some
particular
seat
a
candidate
to
be
successful
must
obtain
one
half
one
of
the
total
number
of
votes
recorded
if
no
candidate
secures
that
number
a
second
ballot
ensues
a
fortnight
later
on
the
second
occasion
a
relative
majority
suffices
for
though
it
had
accepted
political
equality
the
indeed
was
unwilling
to
concede
equality
in
the
economic
field
for
it
desired
to
restore
nothing
of
what
it
had
stolen
and
to
resist
the
onslaught
from
below
it
preferred
to
ally
itself
with
its
old
enemies
it
again
began
to
think
that
religion
had
some
good
features
that
it
was
useful
as
a
kind
of
police
institution
a
barrier
which
alone
might
check
the
growing
appetite
of
the
masses
and
as
a
first
step
the
was
gradually
garbing
itself
in
militarism
nationalism
and
all
the
other
hypocritical
disguises
under
which
invading
clericalism
pursued
its
road
the
army
became
merely
the
emblem
of
brute
force
upholding
the
thefts
of
ages
an
impregnable
wall
of
bayonets
within
whose
shelter
property
and
capital
duly
gorged
might
digest
in
security
the
nation
the
country
was
the
of
abuses
and
iniquities
which
it
was
criminal
to
touch
the
monstrous
social
edifice
not
one
beam
of
which
must
be
changed
for
dread
lest
all
should
fall
the
jews
even
as
in
the
middle
ages
served
as
a
pretext
to
instil
fresh
warmth
into
cooling
beliefs
to
exploit
ancestral
hatred
and
sow
the
horrid
seeds
of
civil
war
and
beneath
that
movement
of
reaction
there
was
nought
save
the
stealthy
labour
of
the
church
seeking
to
regain
the
ground
she
had
formerly
lost
when
the
old
world
broke
up
beneath
the
liberating
breath
of
the
french
revolution
it
was
the
revolution
that
the
church
strove
to
kill
by
regaining
ascendency
over
the
which
the
revolution
had
raised
to
power
and
which
had
decided
to
betray
it
in
order
to
retain
that
power
of
which
it
owed
account
to
the
masses
and
the
return
of
the
to
the
bosom
of
the
church
would
lead
to
the
reconquest
of
the
people
for
the
church
vast
design
was
to
subjugate
men
by
the
influence
of
women
and
particularly
to
lay
hold
of
the
children
in
their
schools
and
confine
their
minds
in
the
dim
prison
of
dogmas
if
the
france
of
voltaire
were
again
becoming
the
france
of
rome
it
was
because
the
teaching
congregations
had
set
their
grip
on
the
young
and
the
position
was
becoming
worse
and
worse
the
church
was
already
shrieking
victory
victory
over
the
democracy
victory
over
science
full
of
the
hope
that
she
would
prevent
the
inevitable
the
completion
of
the
revolution
the
junction
of
the
masses
with
the
in
the
seat
of
power
and
the
final
liberation
of
the
entire
people
situation
grows
worse
daily
said
salvan
know
what
a
frantic
campaign
is
being
carried
on
against
our
system
of
elementary
education
last
sunday
at
beaumont
a
priest
went
so
far
as
to
say
in
the
pulpit
that
a
secular
schoolmaster
was
satan
disguised
as
a
pedagogue
fathers
and
mothers
he
cried
you
should
wish
your
children
to
be
dead
rather
than
in
such
hells
as
those
schools
as
for
secondary
education
that
also
is
a
prey
to
clerical
reaction
apart
from
the
prosperity
of
such
congregational
establishments
as
the
college
of
valmarie
where
the
jesuits
finish
poisoning
the
sons
of
the
the
officers
functionaries
and
magistrates
of
the
future
our
lycées
even
remain
in
the
power
of
the
priests
here
at
beaumont
for
instance
the
director
the
devout
depinvilliers
openly
receives
father
crabot
who
is
i
think
the
confessor
of
his
wife
and
daughters
lately
as
he
felt
discontented
with
abbé
leriche
a
worthy
but
very
aged
man
who
had
fallen
asleep
in
his
post
he
secured
a
thoroughly
militant
chaplain
at
the
lycées
no
doubt
religious
exercises
are
optional
but
for
a
boy
to
be
exempted
from
them
a
request
from
his
parents
is
required
and
naturally
the
pupil
about
whom
a
fuss
is
made
in
that
respect
is
badly
noted
set
upon
one
side
and
even
subjected
to
all
sorts
of
petty
persecutions
briefly
after
thirty
years
of
republican
rule
a
century
of
active
free
thought
the
church
still
trains
and
educates
our
children
still
remains
paramount
intent
on
retaining
her
domination
over
the
world
by
moulding
in
the
same
old
moulds
as
formerly
the
men
of
bondage
and
error
that
she
needs
to
govern
on
her
behalf
and
all
the
wretchedness
of
the
times
comes
from
that
cause
what
do
you
advise
me
to
do
my
friend
marc
inquired
acting
as
i
have
done
am
i
to
retreat
certainly
not
perhaps
if
you
had
warned
me
i
might
have
begged
you
to
wait
a
little
longer
but
as
you
have
removed
that
crucifix
you
must
defend
yourself
after
writing
to
you
i
saw
le
barazer
our
academy
inspector
and
i
now
feel
somewhat
easier
in
mind
you
know
him
and
you
are
aware
how
difficult
it
is
to
guess
his
thoughts
yet
i
believe
that
he
is
at
heart
on
our
side
and
i
should
be
greatly
surprised
if
he
were
to
play
into
the
hands
of
our
enemies
but
everything
will
depend
on
you
on
your
power
of
resistance
on
the
firmness
of
the
position
you
have
acquired
at
maillebois
i
foresee
a
frantic
campaign
on
the
part
of
the
brothers
the
capuchins
and
the
jesuits
for
you
are
not
merely
a
secular
schoolmaster
otherwise
an
incarnation
of
satan
but
you
are
particularly
the
defender
of
simon
that
is
the
torchbearer
the
soldier
of
truth
and
justice
whose
light
must
be
extinguished
and
whose
lips
must
be
sealed
in
any
case
be
prudent
and
sensible
and
keep
up
your
courage
salvan
who
had
risen
grasped
the
young
man
hands
and
for
a
moment
they
remained
thus
smiling
as
they
gazed
at
each
other
their
eyes
shining
with
courage
and
faith
least
you
do
not
despair
of
the
final
result
my
friend
my
boy
ah
never
victory
is
certain
i
do
not
know
when
it
will
come
but
it
is
certain
besides
there
is
more
cowardice
and
egotism
than
actual
malice
among
some
of
our
adversaries
how
many
of
our
university
men
are
neither
really
good
nor
really
bad
though
on
striking
an
average
one
finds
perhaps
rather
more
goodness
than
evil
among
them
the
worst
is
that
they
are
functionaries
and
as
such
are
wedded
to
routine
apart
from
which
their
one
concern
is
their
advancement
as
is
natural
forbes
our
rector
harbours
i
fancy
the
contempt
of
a
philosopher
for
these
wretched
times
and
on
that
account
is
content
to
play
the
part
of
a
piece
of
administrative
mechanism
connecting
the
minister
with
the
university
staff
then
too
if
depinvilliers
sets
himself
on
the
side
of
the
church
it
is
merely
because
he
has
two
ugly
daughters
on
his
hands
and
relies
on
father
crabot
to
supply
them
with
rich
husbands
as
for
the
terrible
mauraisin
whom
you
will
do
well
to
beware
of
for
he
has
an
ugly
soul
he
would
like
to
be
in
my
shoes
and
he
would
go
over
to
your
side
if
he
thought
you
in
a
position
to
give
him
my
berth
yes
yes
many
of
them
are
merely
poor
hungry
devils
while
others
are
men
of
weak
intellect
they
will
come
over
to
our
side
and
even
help
us
when
we
have
won
the
battle
he
laughed
indulgently
then
becoming
grave
once
more
he
added
the
good
work
i
do
here
prevents
me
from
despairing
as
you
know
i
hide
myself
away
in
my
little
corner
but
day
by
day
i
strive
to
hasten
the
future
and
things
move
they
move
i
am
very
well
satisfied
with
my
young
men
no
doubt
it
is
still
rather
difficult
to
recruit
students
for
the
profession
appears
so
thankless
so
poorly
paid
leading
to
nothing
but
contumely
and
a
life
of
certain
wretchedness
all
the
same
we
had
more
competitors
than
usual
this
year
it
is
hoped
that
the
chambers
will
end
by
voting
reasonable
salaries
such
as
may
enable
the
humblest
masters
to
live
in
some
little
dignity
and
you
will
see
you
will
see
what
will
happen
when
properly
trained
masters
leave
this
college
and
spread
through
the
villages
and
the
towns
carrying
words
of
deliverance
with
them
destroying
error
superstition
and
falsehood
on
all
sides
like
the
missionaries
of
a
new
humanity
the
church
will
be
vanquished
then
for
it
can
only
subsist
and
triumph
amid
ignorance
and
when
it
is
swept
away
the
whole
nation
will
march
unchecked
towards
solidarity
and
peace
my
old
friend
that
is
the
great
hope
cried
marc
is
what
lends
all
of
us
the
strength
and
cheerfulness
we
need
to
do
our
work
thanks
for
inspiriting
me
i
will
try
to
be
sensible
and
courageous
they
once
more
shook
hands
energetically
and
marc
returned
to
maillebois
where
the
fiercest
battle
war
to
the
knife
awaited
him
there
as
at
beaumont
the
political
situation
had
become
worse
the
last
municipal
elections
following
those
for
the
chamber
of
deputies
had
also
given
disastrous
results
darras
had
found
his
party
in
a
minority
in
the
new
municipal
council
and
philis
the
clerical
councillor
the
leader
of
the
reactionary
cause
had
now
been
elected
mayor
before
everything
else
marc
wished
to
see
darras
in
order
to
ascertain
how
far
the
latter
might
yet
be
able
to
support
him
so
he
presented
himself
one
evening
in
the
comfortable
of
the
handsome
house
which
the
contractor
had
built
himself
darras
as
soon
as
he
perceived
him
raised
his
arms
to
the
ceiling
my
dear
schoolmaster
so
now
you
have
the
whole
pack
at
your
heels
oh
i
shall
be
on
your
side
you
may
rely
on
me
now
that
i
am
beaten
reduced
to
opposition
it
was
difficult
for
me
to
be
always
on
your
side
when
i
was
mayor
for
as
you
know
the
majority
i
disposed
of
was
only
one
of
two
votes
but
even
when
i
had
to
act
contrary
to
your
desires
i
repeated
to
myself
that
you
were
a
thousand
times
right
at
present
we
shall
be
able
to
go
forward
since
the
only
course
open
to
me
is
to
fight
and
try
to
upset
philis
and
take
the
mayoralty
from
him
you
did
quite
right
when
you
removed
that
crucifix
from
the
schoolroom
it
was
there
in
simon
time
and
it
ought
never
to
have
been
there
at
all
marc
made
bold
to
smile
every
time
i
spoke
to
you
of
removing
it
said
he
protested
you
talked
of
the
necessity
of
prudence
of
the
danger
of
frightening
the
children
parents
and
giving
our
adversaries
a
weapon
against
us
i
have
just
admitted
to
you
how
embarrassed
i
was
ah
it
is
by
no
means
easy
to
manage
a
town
like
maillebois
where
the
forces
of
the
different
parties
have
always
balanced
and
where
nobody
has
ever
been
able
to
tell
whether
the
freethinkers
or
the
priests
would
win
the
day
at
this
moment
we
are
certainly
not
in
a
brilliant
position
but
we
must
keep
up
our
courage
we
shall
end
by
giving
them
a
good
licking
which
will
make
us
masters
of
the
town
for
good
certain
replied
marc
delighted
with
the
fine
valour
displayed
by
the
ambitious
contractor
who
at
heart
was
a
worthy
man
continued
darras
philis
wo
dare
to
take
any
serious
step
for
in
his
turn
he
has
only
a
majority
of
two
such
as
rendered
me
so
timid
he
is
condemned
to
mark
time
and
will
live
in
constant
fear
of
some
slight
change
which
may
place
him
in
a
minority
i
know
by
experience
what
that
means
he
made
merry
over
it
in
a
noisy
way
he
harboured
against
philis
the
hatred
of
a
big
and
healthy
man
with
a
sound
stomach
and
a
sound
brain
who
was
chagrined
by
the
sight
of
the
new
mayor
lean
little
figure
dark
hard
face
pointed
nose
and
thin
lips
philis
had
retired
from
business
as
a
tilt
and
awning
maker
at
the
time
of
his
wife
death
and
though
possessed
of
an
income
of
some
ten
thousand
francs
a
year
the
real
origin
of
which
remained
somewhat
obscure
he
lived
in
great
retirement
attended
by
a
single
servant
a
huge
fair
creature
of
whom
evil
tongues
spoke
very
badly
her
master
had
a
daughter
named
octavie
twelve
years
of
age
now
with
the
nuns
of
the
visitation
at
beaumont
and
a
son
raymond
ten
years
old
who
was
a
boarder
at
the
jesuit
college
of
valmarie
pending
the
time
when
he
might
enter
the
military
school
of
cyr
having
thus
rid
himself
of
his
children
the
new
mayor
led
a
close
narrow
life
most
careful
in
all
his
religious
observances
ever
in
conference
with
the
black
frocks
and
really
acting
as
the
executor
of
the
congregations
decisions
his
election
as
mayor
was
sufficient
proof
of
the
acute
stage
which
the
religious
crisis
had
reached
in
that
town
of
maillebois
which
the
struggle
between
the
republic
and
the
church
was
ravaging
so
i
may
go
forward
said
marc
will
support
me
with
the
minority
of
the
council
certainly
cried
darras
be
reasonable
do
give
us
too
big
an
affair
to
deal
with
on
the
very
morrow
the
contest
began
and
apparently
it
was
savin
the
clerk
the
father
of
the
twin
boys
achille
and
philippe
who
was
chosen
to
strike
the
first
blow
at
all
events
on
leaving
his
office
in
the
evening
he
came
to
the
school
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
the
master
know
what
i
am
is
that
not
so
monsieur
froment
said
he
am
a
radical
republican
and
nobody
can
suspect
me
of
conspiring
with
the
priests
nevertheless
on
behalf
of
a
number
of
parents
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
replace
that
crucifix
which
you
removed
for
religion
is
necessary
for
children
as
well
as
for
women
no
priests
in
the
school
i
agree
to
that
but
christ
remember
it
was
the
first
of
republicans
and
revolutionaries
marc
however
desired
to
know
the
names
of
the
other
parents
whom
savin
represented
you
have
not
come
merely
on
your
own
behalf
said
he
you
tell
me
what
families
have
delegated
you
delegated
that
is
not
quite
correct
i
have
seen
doloir
the
mason
and
bongard
the
farmer
and
have
found
that
they
blame
you
as
i
myself
do
only
it
is
always
compromising
to
protest
and
give
signature
is
that
not
so
i
myself
risk
a
good
deal
by
coming
forward
on
account
of
my
superiors
but
the
voice
of
my
conscience
as
the
father
of
a
family
speaks
too
loudly
for
me
to
act
otherwise
how
shall
i
ever
manage
those
two
scapegraces
of
mine
achille
and
philippe
if
you
do
not
frighten
them
a
little
with
fear
of
the
punishment
of
god
and
the
torments
of
hell
look
at
my
big
girl
hortense
who
is
so
good
in
every
respect
and
who
was
admired
by
all
maillebois
when
she
took
her
first
communion
this
year
by
taking
her
to
church
mademoiselle
rouzaire
has
made
her
really
perfect
compare
your
work
with
mademoiselle
rouzaire
compare
my
two
boys
with
my
daughter
by
that
comparison
alone
you
stand
condemned
monsieur
froment
marc
smiled
in
his
quiet
way
the
amiable
hortense
a
pretty
and
precocious
girl
of
thirteen
one
of
mademoiselle
favourites
occasionally
contrived
to
climb
over
the
wall
separating
the
playgrounds
of
the
two
schools
in
order
that
she
might
hide
away
in
corners
with
lads
of
her
own
age
even
as
savin
had
suggested
the
young
man
had
often
compared
his
pupils
from
whom
by
degrees
he
obtained
a
little
more
reason
and
truth
with
the
pupils
of
the
schoolmistress
his
neighbour
the
affectedly
prim
and
gentle
little
girls
who
were
fed
on
clerical
pap
falsehood
and
hypocrisy
and
perturbed
even
secretly
spoilt
by
the
corrupting
influence
of
the
mysterious
marc
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
his
boys
and
those
girls
together
those
girls
who
were
now
reared
and
educated
apart
from
whom
everything
was
hidden
whose
minds
and
whose
senses
were
heated
by
all
the
fires
of
mysticism
they
would
then
have
ceased
to
climb
over
walls
to
go
in
search
of
sin
the
forbidden
fruit
of
damnation
and
delight
yes
only
a
system
of
mixed
schools
could
ensure
the
health
and
strength
of
the
free
and
happy
nation
of
footnote
this
problem
seems
to
have
been
solved
in
the
united
states
where
judging
by
official
reports
the
mingling
of
the
sexes
in
the
schools
is
extensive
thence
i
judge
the
matter
as
an
european
must
have
come
the
very
great
and
distinctly
beneficial
influence
exercised
by
american
women
on
the
national
character
perhaps
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
apart
from
such
incentives
as
a
mere
desire
to
gain
money
the
women
of
the
united
states
have
largely
helped
to
make
their
race
the
most
enterprising
and
progressive
in
the
world
as
for
the
influence
of
mixed
schools
on
morals
americans
have
repeatedly
assured
me
that
it
has
been
the
best
to
savin
however
marc
merely
said
rouzaire
does
her
duty
as
she
understands
it
and
i
do
mine
in
the
same
way
if
families
would
only
help
me
the
good
work
of
training
and
education
would
progress
more
rapidly
at
this
savin
lost
his
temper
lean
and
puny
buttoned
up
in
his
shabby
frock
coat
he
drew
himself
erect
on
his
little
legs
you
insinuate
that
i
give
bad
examples
to
my
children
he
asked
certainly
not
only
everything
that
i
teach
them
here
is
afterwards
contradicted
by
what
they
see
in
the
world
around
them
they
find
truthfulness
regarded
as
dangerous
audacity
and
reason
condemned
as
being
insufficient
incapable
of
forming
honest
men
marc
indeed
was
greatly
grieved
that
he
should
be
thwarted
so
often
by
his
pupils
parents
when
he
dreamt
of
obtaining
from
them
the
necessary
help
to
hasten
the
emancipation
of
the
humble
if
on
leaving
school
every
day
the
children
had
only
found
in
their
homes
some
realisation
of
their
lessons
some
practice
of
the
social
duties
and
rights
in
which
they
were
instructed
how
much
easier
and
swifter
would
have
been
the
march
of
improvement
such
collaboration
was
even
indispensable
the
schoolmaster
could
not
suffice
for
many
things
the
most
delicate
the
most
useful
when
his
pupils
parents
did
not
continue
his
work
in
the
same
spirit
and
complete
it
the
master
and
the
parents
ought
to
have
gone
hand
in
hand
towards
the
same
goal
of
truth
and
justice
and
how
sad
it
was
when
instead
of
obtaining
the
parents
help
the
master
saw
them
destroying
the
little
good
he
effected
unconscious
for
the
most
part
of
what
they
were
doing
yielding
simply
to
the
incoherence
of
their
ideas
and
their
lives
but
savin
was
again
speaking
said
he
will
hang
up
that
cross
again
monsieur
froment
if
you
wish
to
please
us
all
and
live
on
good
terms
with
us
which
is
what
we
desire
for
you
are
not
a
bad
schoolmaster
marc
smiled
again
you
he
said
why
did
not
madame
savin
accompany
you
she
at
any
rate
would
have
been
playing
her
proper
part
for
she
follows
the
observances
of
the
church
i
know
it
is
religious
as
all
respectable
women
ought
to
be
the
clerk
answered
dryly
would
rather
have
her
go
to
mass
than
take
a
lover
he
looked
at
marc
suspiciously
consumed
as
he
was
by
sickly
jealousy
regarding
every
man
as
a
possible
rival
why
did
the
schoolmaster
regret
that
his
wife
had
not
accompanied
him
had
she
not
twice
called
at
the
school
recently
under
the
pretext
of
explaining
to
the
master
why
achille
and
philippe
had
been
absent
on
sundry
occasions
for
some
time
past
he
savin
had
compelled
her
to
confess
regularly
once
a
week
to
father
théodose
the
superior
of
the
capuchins
for
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
the
shame
of
avowal
might
stay
her
in
her
course
along
the
road
to
infidelity
on
her
side
if
in
earlier
times
she
had
followed
the
church
observances
merely
in
order
to
secure
peace
at
home
for
she
was
quite
destitute
of
faith
she
now
repaired
with
some
alacrity
to
the
tribunal
of
penitence
for
like
the
other
young
devotees
who
dreamt
of
father
théodose
she
had
rid
herself
of
earlier
prejudices
and
begun
to
regard
him
as
a
superb
and
most
delightful
man
it
happens
said
marc
with
some
little
maliciousness
in
response
to
savin
declaration
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
madame
savin
last
thursday
she
was
leaving
the
chapel
on
the
place
des
capucins
and
we
had
a
brief
chat
as
all
her
words
to
me
were
most
gracious
i
thought
i
might
express
my
regret
at
not
seeing
her
with
you
the
husband
made
a
doleful
gesture
his
everlasting
suspicions
had
reached
such
a
point
that
he
himself
now
went
to
beaumont
to
deliver
the
bead
work
which
he
allowed
his
wife
to
do
in
secret
in
order
to
add
a
few
indispensable
coppers
to
his
meagre
salary
their
case
was
one
of
hidden
wretchedness
with
all
the
torments
that
make
hells
of
the
homes
of
needy
employés
burdened
with
children
the
embittered
husband
becoming
an
unbearable
despot
and
the
gentle
and
pretty
wife
resigning
herself
in
silence
until
she
at
last
discovers
some
consolation
wife
neither
has
nor
ought
to
have
any
opinion
but
mine
savin
ended
by
declaring
is
in
her
name
as
well
as
my
own
and
in
the
names
of
many
other
parents
i
repeat
it
that
i
have
made
this
application
to
you
it
is
now
for
you
to
decide
if
you
will
act
upon
it
you
will
think
the
matter
over
have
thought
it
over
monsieur
savin
replied
marc
who
had
become
grave
again
removing
that
crucifix
i
understood
fully
what
i
was
going
to
do
and
since
it
is
no
longer
there
i
shall
certainly
not
put
it
up
again
on
the
following
day
a
report
spread
through
maillebois
that
a
deputation
of
parents
fathers
and
mothers
had
called
upon
the
schoolmaster
and
that
there
had
been
a
stormy
explanation
a
frightful
scandal
but
marc
soon
understood
whence
the
attack
had
really
come
for
chance
acquainted
him
with
the
circumstances
which
had
led
to
savin
visit
though
pretty
madame
savin
took
no
real
interest
in
the
affair
absorbed
as
she
was
in
her
desire
for
a
little
more
personal
happiness
she
had
none
the
less
served
as
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
father
théodose
for
it
was
on
being
approached
by
her
on
the
capuchin
behalf
that
her
husband
had
repaired
to
a
secret
interview
with
the
latter
which
interview
had
prompted
him
to
call
on
marc
and
endeavour
to
check
a
state
of
things
which
was
so
prejudicial
to
family
morality
and
good
order
no
crucifixes
in
the
schools
indeed
would
that
not
mean
indiscipline
among
the
boys
and
shamelessness
among
the
girls
and
their
mothers
also
so
the
lean
and
little
savin
the
republican
and
unhinged
by
his
wretched
spoilt
life
and
his
idiotic
jealousy
had
set
forth
to
champion
the
cause
of
virtue
like
an
authoritarian
a
catholic
who
pictured
the
human
paradise
as
a
gaol
in
which
everything
human
ought
to
be
subdued
and
crushed
besides
behind
father
théodose
marc
readily
divined
brother
fulgence
and
his
assistants
brothers
gorgias
and
isidore
who
hated
the
secular
school
more
than
ever
since
it
had
been
taking
pupils
from
them
and
behind
the
brothers
came
fathers
philibin
and
crabot
of
the
college
of
valmarie
those
powerful
personages
whose
skilful
unseen
hands
had
been
directing
the
whole
campaign
ever
since
the
monstrous
simon
affair
the
accomplices
in
that
slumbering
crime
seemed
determined
to
defend
it
by
other
deeds
of
iniquity
at
the
outset
marc
had
guessed
where
the
whole
band
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
was
crouching
but
how
could
one
seize
and
convict
them
if
father
crabot
amiable
and
worldly
still
showed
himself
constantly
among
the
fine
society
of
beaumont
busily
directing
the
steps
of
his
penitents
and
ensuring
the
rapid
fortune
of
his
former
pupils
his
assistant
father
philibin
had
virtually
disappeared
restricting
himself
entirely
so
it
seemed
to
his
absorbing
duties
as
manager
at
valmarie
nothing
transpired
of
the
stealthy
work
which
was
so
ardently
pursued
in
the
darkness
every
moment
being
employed
to
ensure
the
triumph
of
the
good
cause
all
that
marc
himself
could
detect
was
the
espionage
attending
his
own
movements
he
was
tracked
with
priestly
caution
black
figures
were
constantly
prowling
around
him
none
of
his
visits
to
the
lehmanns
none
of
his
conversations
with
david
could
have
remained
unknown
and
as
salvan
had
said
the
others
tracked
him
because
he
was
an
impassioned
soldier
of
truth
and
justice
because
he
was
a
witness
who
already
possessed
certain
proofs
and
whose
avenging
cry
must
be
thrust
back
into
his
throat
even
by
extermination
if
necessary
to
that
task
the
frock
and
cassock
wearers
devoted
themselves
with
increasing
audacity
joined
even
by
poor
abbé
quandieu
who
felt
grieved
at
having
to
place
religion
at
the
service
of
such
iniquitous
work
but
who
resigned
himself
to
it
in
obedience
to
the
behests
of
his
bishop
the
mournful
monseigneur
bergerot
whom
he
visited
every
week
at
beaumont
to
take
his
orders
and
console
him
in
his
defeat
bishop
and
priest
cast
the
cloak
of
their
ministry
over
the
sore
devouring
the
church
whose
respectful
sons
they
were
hiding
meantime
their
tears
and
their
fears
unwilling
to
acknowledge
the
mortal
danger
into
which
they
saw
religion
sinking
one
evening
mignot
on
coming
into
the
school
from
the
playground
said
to
marc
in
a
fury
getting
quite
disgusting
monsieur
i
again
caught
mademoiselle
rouzaire
spying
on
us
from
the
top
of
a
ladder
indeed
whenever
the
schoolmistress
fancied
that
she
would
not
be
detected
she
set
a
ladder
against
the
wall
dividing
the
two
playgrounds
in
order
that
she
might
ascertain
what
was
going
on
in
the
boys
school
and
mignot
accused
her
of
sending
secret
reports
on
the
subject
to
mauraisin
every
week
let
her
pry
marc
answered
gaily
there
is
no
occasion
for
her
to
tire
herself
by
climbing
a
ladder
i
set
the
door
wide
open
for
her
if
she
desires
it
no
not
that
cried
the
assistant
her
keep
her
place
if
she
tries
it
on
again
i
shall
go
round
and
pull
her
down
by
the
legs
marc
to
his
great
satisfaction
was
now
gradually
completing
the
conquest
of
mignot
the
latter
like
a
peasant
son
whose
one
desire
was
to
escape
the
plough
a
man
of
average
mind
and
character
who
like
so
many
others
thought
solely
of
his
immediate
interests
had
always
shown
himself
distrustful
with
simon
indeed
nothing
good
could
come
from
a
jew
and
so
he
had
deemed
it
prudent
to
keep
aloof
from
him
at
the
time
of
the
trial
therefore
though
he
was
sufficiently
honest
to
refrain
from
overwhelming
the
innocent
prisoner
he
had
not
given
the
good
and
truthful
evidence
which
might
have
saved
him
at
a
later
stage
he
had
likewise
placed
himself
on
the
defensive
with
marc
with
whom
he
thought
it
would
be
foolish
to
ally
himself
if
he
desired
advancement
for
nearly
a
whole
year
therefore
he
had
displayed
hostility
taking
his
meals
at
an
grudging
the
help
he
gave
in
the
school
work
and
freely
blaming
his
principal
attitude
at
that
time
indeed
he
had
been
very
thick
with
mademoiselle
rouzaire
and
willing
it
seemed
to
place
himself
at
the
orders
of
the
congregations
but
marc
instead
of
evincing
any
perturbation
had
treated
his
assistant
with
unremitting
kindness
as
if
he
were
desirous
of
giving
him
all
necessary
time
to
reflect
and
understand
that
his
real
interest
lay
on
the
side
of
truth
and
equity
indeed
in
marc
opinion
that
big
calm
young
fellow
whose
only
passion
was
angling
offered
an
interesting
subject
for
experiment
though
he
became
cowardly
when
he
thought
of
the
future
and
was
somewhat
spoilt
by
the
environment
of
ferocious
egotism
in
which
he
found
himself
there
was
nothing
absolutely
evil
in
his
nature
in
fact
he
might
be
made
an
excellent
school
teacher
and
even
a
man
of
most
upright
mind
if
he
were
helped
sustained
by
one
of
energy
and
intelligence
the
idea
of
experimenting
in
that
sense
attracted
marc
who
felt
well
pleased
as
little
by
little
he
gained
the
confidence
and
affection
of
this
wanderer
thereby
proving
the
truth
of
the
axiom
in
which
he
set
all
his
hopes
of
future
deliverance
that
there
is
no
man
even
one
on
the
road
to
perdition
who
may
not
be
made
an
artisan
of
progress
mignot
had
been
won
over
by
the
active
gaiety
the
beneficent
glow
of
truth
and
justice
which
marc
set
around
him
he
now
took
his
meals
with
his
principal
and
had
become
as
it
were
a
member
of
the
family
is
wrong
of
you
not
to
distrust
mademoiselle
rouzaire
he
resumed
have
no
idea
monsieur
of
what
she
is
capable
she
would
betray
you
a
dozen
times
over
in
order
to
obtain
good
reports
from
her
friend
mauraisin
then
being
in
a
confidential
mood
he
related
how
she
had
repeatedly
urged
him
to
listen
at
keyholes
and
report
to
her
he
knew
her
well
she
was
a
terrible
woman
harsh
and
avaricious
despite
all
her
varnish
of
exaggerated
courtesy
and
though
she
was
big
and
bony
with
a
flat
freckled
face
quite
destitute
of
any
charm
she
ended
by
seducing
everybody
as
she
herself
boasted
she
knew
how
to
act
to
the
who
angrily
reproached
her
for
taking
her
girls
so
often
to
church
she
replied
that
she
was
compelled
to
comply
with
the
desires
of
the
parents
under
penalty
of
losing
her
pupils
to
the
clericals
she
gave
the
most
substantial
pledges
convinced
as
she
was
that
they
were
the
stronger
party
and
that
on
their
influence
depended
the
best
appointments
even
in
the
secular
school
world
in
reality
she
was
guided
solely
by
her
own
interests
as
she
understood
them
having
inherited
the
instincts
of
a
petty
trader
from
her
parents
who
had
kept
a
fruiterer
shop
at
beaumont
she
had
not
married
because
she
preferred
to
live
as
she
listed
and
although
she
did
not
carry
on
with
the
priests
as
was
maliciously
rumoured
by
evil
tongues
it
seemed
certain
that
she
had
a
soft
spot
in
her
heart
for
handsome
mauraisin
who
like
the
little
man
he
was
admired
women
built
after
the
fashion
of
gendarmes
again
it
was
not
true
that
she
got
drunk
though
she
was
very
fond
of
sweet
liqueurs
if
she
occasionally
looked
very
red
when
afternoon
lessons
began
it
was
simply
because
she
ate
abundantly
and
her
digestive
organs
were
out
of
order
marc
made
an
indulgent
gesture
does
not
keep
her
school
badly
said
he
only
thing
that
grieves
me
is
the
spirit
of
narrow
pietism
which
she
introduces
into
all
her
teaching
my
boys
and
her
girls
are
separated
by
an
abyss
not
merely
by
a
wall
and
when
they
meet
one
another
later
and
think
of
marrying
they
will
belong
to
different
worlds
but
is
not
that
the
traditional
custom
the
warfare
of
the
sexes
largely
arises
from
it
the
young
man
did
not
mention
the
chief
cause
of
his
rancour
against
mademoiselle
rouzaire
the
reason
which
had
impelled
him
to
keep
aloof
from
her
this
was
her
abominable
conduct
in
simon
case
he
remembered
the
quiet
effrontery
with
which
she
had
played
the
game
of
the
congregations
at
the
trial
at
beaumont
how
she
had
heaped
impudent
falsehoods
on
the
innocent
prisoner
how
she
had
accused
him
of
giving
immoral
and
lessons
to
his
pupils
and
so
intercourse
with
her
since
his
appointment
to
maillebois
had
never
gone
beyond
the
limits
of
strict
politeness
such
as
the
proximity
of
their
homes
required
she
however
having
seen
the
young
man
strengthen
his
position
in
such
wise
that
his
sudden
downfall
could
now
hardly
be
anticipated
had
made
attempts
at
reconciliation
for
in
her
anxiety
to
be
always
on
the
stronger
side
she
was
not
the
woman
to
turn
her
back
on
the
victorious
she
had
manœuvred
particularly
with
the
object
of
ingratiating
herself
with
geneviève
but
the
latter
in
this
matter
had
hitherto
shared
marc
opinions
and
kept
her
at
a
distance
all
events
monsieur
mignot
concluded
advise
you
to
keep
your
eyes
open
if
i
had
listened
to
la
rouzaire
i
should
have
betrayed
you
a
score
of
times
she
never
ceased
questioning
me
about
you
repeating
to
me
that
i
was
a
stupid
and
would
never
succeed
in
getting
into
a
decent
position
but
you
showed
me
great
kindness
and
you
know
what
horrid
things
you
saved
me
from
for
one
soon
listens
to
those
creatures
when
they
promise
you
every
kind
of
success
and
as
i
am
on
this
subject
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
venture
to
give
you
some
advice
you
ought
to
warn
madame
froment
her
what
do
you
mean
yes
i
do
keep
my
eyes
in
my
pockets
for
some
time
past
i
have
seen
la
rouzaire
prowling
around
your
wife
it
is
dear
madame
here
a
smile
or
a
caress
there
all
kinds
of
advances
which
would
make
me
tremble
if
i
were
in
your
shoes
marc
who
felt
greatly
astonished
made
a
pretence
of
smiling
my
wife
has
nothing
to
fear
she
is
warned
said
he
is
difficult
for
her
to
behave
impolitely
with
a
neighbour
particularly
when
one
is
connected
by
similar
duties
mignot
did
not
insist
but
he
shook
his
head
doubtfully
for
his
intercourse
with
the
froments
had
acquainted
him
with
the
secret
drama
which
was
slowly
gathering
in
their
home
however
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
unwilling
to
say
all
he
knew
and
marc
on
his
side
also
became
silent
again
mastered
by
the
covert
dread
the
unacknowledged
weakness
which
assailed
and
paralysed
him
whenever
the
possibility
of
a
struggle
between
geneviève
and
himself
presented
itself
to
his
mind
all
at
once
the
attack
of
the
congregations
which
he
had
been
anticipating
ever
since
his
visit
to
salvan
took
place
the
campaign
began
with
a
virulent
report
from
mauraisin
on
the
subject
of
the
removal
of
the
crucifix
and
the
scandal
caused
among
the
parents
by
that
act
of
religious
intolerance
savin
protest
was
duly
recorded
and
the
doloir
and
bongard
families
were
cited
among
those
who
blamed
the
proceeding
the
incident
was
one
of
exceptional
gravity
according
to
the
inspector
for
it
had
occurred
in
a
town
reputed
for
its
frequent
and
numerously
attended
pilgrimages
a
town
indeed
where
it
was
necessary
for
the
secular
school
to
make
concessions
if
it
was
to
escape
defeat
from
its
congregational
rival
mauraisin
concluded
therefore
in
favour
of
the
removal
of
the
schoolmaster
a
sectarian
of
the
worst
kind
who
had
thus
incautiously
compromised
the
university
cause
and
his
indictment
was
completed
by
the
recital
of
a
number
of
little
facts
the
harvest
of
all
the
daily
espionage
carried
on
by
mademoiselle
rouzaire
whose
docile
little
girls
ever
at
mass
or
at
the
catechism
classes
were
contrasted
with
the
idle
rebellious
unbelieving
lads
trained
by
that
anarchist
master
froment
three
days
later
marc
learnt
that
count
hector
de
sanglebœuf
the
catholic
deputy
accompanied
by
two
of
his
colleagues
had
made
an
application
on
the
subject
to
prefect
hennebise
sanglebœuf
was
evidently
acquainted
with
mauraisin
report
even
if
he
had
not
helped
to
draft
it
in
conjunction
with
his
friend
father
crabot
who
so
frequently
visited
la
désirade
and
the
idea
undoubtedly
was
to
take
that
report
as
a
basis
in
demanding
the
dismissal
of
marc
hennebise
whose
policy
was
to
live
at
peace
with
everybody
and
who
constantly
urged
his
subordinates
to
refrain
from
stirring
up
trouble
must
have
felt
very
worried
by
the
incident
which
might
lead
to
disastrous
complications
the
prefect
feelings
were
with
sanglebœuf
but
it
was
dangerous
to
adhere
publicly
to
the
reactionary
cause
so
while
sympathising
with
the
fiery
deputy
he
explained
that
he
was
not
master
of
the
situation
for
the
law
was
precise
and
prevented
him
from
removing
a
schoolmaster
unless
that
step
were
proposed
to
him
by
academy
inspector
le
barazer
with
some
relief
therefore
the
prefect
referred
the
gentlemen
to
the
inspector
to
whose
office
which
was
also
in
the
préfecture
buildings
they
immediately
repaired
le
barazer
an
who
had
become
a
prudent
diplomatist
listened
to
them
with
a
great
show
of
attentive
deference
he
was
a
man
of
fifty
with
a
broad
face
and
as
yet
scarcely
a
grey
hair
he
had
grown
up
hating
the
empire
and
as
he
regarded
secular
education
as
one
of
the
foundation
stones
of
the
republic
he
pursued
by
all
available
means
the
task
of
crushing
the
congregational
schools
whose
triumph
in
his
estimation
would
have
killed
france
but
experience
had
shown
him
the
danger
of
violent
action
and
he
adhered
to
a
long
meditated
and
prudent
course
which
led
some
extremists
to
regard
him
as
a
very
lukewarm
republican
yet
he
was
associated
with
some
extraordinary
victories
achieved
by
long
years
of
discreet
and
patient
action
at
sanglebœuf
first
words
he
made
a
show
of
disapproving
marc
removal
of
the
crucifix
which
said
he
was
a
useless
demonstration
though
he
pointed
out
that
nothing
in
the
laws
compelled
the
schoolmasters
to
allow
religious
emblems
in
the
schools
it
was
all
a
mere
question
of
usage
and
he
discreetly
allowed
it
to
be
seen
that
this
usage
scarcely
had
his
approval
then
as
sanglebœuf
losing
his
temper
proclaimed
himself
a
defender
of
the
church
and
described
the
schoolmaster
of
maillebois
as
a
shameless
individual
who
had
stirred
up
the
entire
population
against
him
the
inspector
placidly
promised
that
he
would
study
the
question
with
all
the
care
it
deserved
but
sanglebœuf
wished
to
know
if
he
had
not
received
a
report
from
his
subordinate
mauraisin
and
whether
that
report
did
not
suffice
to
show
the
gravity
of
the
evil
the
demoralisation
which
could
only
be
arrested
by
the
immediate
removal
of
the
schoolmaster
at
this
question
le
barazer
feigned
great
surprise
what
report
ah
yes
the
quarterly
report
from
the
elementary
inspector
were
its
contents
known
then
in
any
case
those
reports
were
purely
administrative
and
merely
supplied
certain
elements
of
appreciation
for
the
academy
inspector
whose
duty
it
was
to
make
personal
inquiries
and
thereupon
le
barazer
dismissed
the
gentlemen
after
again
promising
to
take
their
application
into
full
account
a
month
went
by
and
nothing
reached
marc
who
daily
expected
a
summons
to
the
préfecture
le
barazer
was
doubtless
following
his
usual
tactics
in
order
to
gain
time
and
exhaust
the
determination
of
the
other
side
even
as
his
friend
salvan
had
foretold
he
was
covertly
supporting
the
young
schoolmaster
but
it
was
essential
that
the
affair
should
not
be
aggravated
that
increasing
scandal
should
not
compel
his
intervention
for
assuredly
he
would
not
defend
marc
beyond
certain
limits
but
would
end
by
sacrificing
him
if
he
thought
that
course
expedient
in
order
that
the
rest
of
his
slow
and
opportunist
campaign
against
the
congregational
schools
might
not
be
interfered
with
unfortunately
things
went
from
bad
to
worse
at
maillebois
petit
yielding
to
an
inspiration
which
could
be
easily
identified
started
a
vile
campaign
against
marc
as
usual
it
began
with
brief
and
vague
paragraphs
abominations
were
taking
place
in
a
neighbouring
little
town
and
if
necessary
precise
information
would
be
given
then
schoolmaster
froment
was
plainly
named
and
under
the
headline
scandal
of
maillebois
which
was
repeated
almost
daily
the
paper
published
an
extraordinary
collection
of
the
results
of
a
pretended
inquiry
among
the
pupils
and
their
parents
in
which
the
schoolmaster
was
accused
of
the
blackest
crimes
people
were
quite
upset
by
these
revelations
the
good
brothers
and
the
capuchins
helped
to
spread
terror
abroad
and
devotees
never
passed
the
communal
school
without
crossing
themselves
marc
became
conscious
that
he
was
in
great
peril
and
mignot
bravely
began
to
pack
up
his
belongings
feeling
certain
that
he
would
be
swept
away
with
his
principal
whose
side
he
had
taken
meantime
mademoiselle
rouzaire
affected
the
most
victorious
airs
when
she
conducted
her
girls
to
mass
father
théodose
in
his
chapel
and
even
curé
quandieu
in
his
pulpit
at
martin
foretold
the
approaching
restoration
of
god
among
the
infidels
by
which
they
meant
that
the
crucifix
would
be
soon
set
up
again
with
all
solemnity
in
the
secular
school
and
as
a
last
blow
marc
on
meeting
darras
found
him
very
cold
resolved
to
abandon
him
for
fear
of
losing
the
support
of
the
minority
of
the
municipal
council
can
you
expect
my
dear
fellow
said
the
have
gone
too
far
we
can
not
follow
you
at
present
at
all
events
that
blackbeetle
philis
is
watching
me
and
i
should
merely
share
your
fate
which
would
be
useless
in
his
despair
marc
hastened
to
salvan
whom
he
regarded
as
the
only
faithful
supporter
remaining
to
him
and
he
found
him
thoughtful
gloomy
almost
embarrassed
are
going
badly
said
he
barazer
remains
silent
seemingly
anxious
and
such
a
furious
campaign
is
being
waged
around
him
that
i
fear
he
may
abandon
you
perhaps
you
acted
too
hastily
marc
heart
was
wrung
by
a
pang
of
grief
for
he
interpreted
those
last
words
as
signifying
that
even
salvan
abandoned
him
you
as
well
my
master
he
exclaimed
but
salvan
full
of
emotion
caught
hold
of
his
hands
no
my
lad
you
must
not
doubt
me
i
remain
on
your
side
with
all
my
heart
only
you
can
have
no
idea
of
the
difficulties
in
which
all
of
us
have
been
placed
by
your
action
simple
and
logical
though
it
was
this
training
college
is
suspected
denounced
as
a
of
irreligion
depinvilliers
profits
by
it
to
exalt
the
services
which
the
chaplain
of
his
lycée
renders
to
the
cause
of
national
pacification
the
reconcilement
of
all
parties
in
the
bosom
of
the
church
even
our
rector
the
peaceable
forbes
is
full
of
concern
fearing
lest
his
tranquillity
should
be
destroyed
le
barazer
no
doubt
is
skilful
but
does
he
possess
the
necessary
strength
of
resistance
is
to
be
done
then
one
must
wait
i
can
only
repeat
to
you
that
you
must
show
yourself
prudent
and
courageous
for
the
rest
we
must
rely
on
the
force
of
truth
and
justice
during
the
next
two
months
marc
displayed
much
brave
serenity
amid
the
outrages
by
which
he
was
assailed
each
day
as
if
ignorant
of
the
muddy
tide
beating
against
his
door
he
pursued
his
duties
with
wondrous
gaiety
and
uprightness
never
had
he
accomplished
more
important
or
more
useful
work
devoting
himself
to
his
pupils
and
teaching
them
as
much
by
example
as
by
words
how
necessary
it
was
to
continue
working
and
to
retain
one
love
for
truth
and
justice
amid
the
very
worst
events
to
the
filth
the
bitter
insults
flung
at
him
by
his
fellow
townsmen
he
replied
with
gentleness
kindliness
and
sacrifice
he
strove
to
make
the
children
better
than
their
fathers
he
sowed
the
happy
future
in
the
furrows
of
the
hateful
present
he
redeemed
the
crime
of
others
at
the
cost
of
his
own
happiness
it
was
the
thought
of
the
young
ones
around
him
the
duty
of
helping
to
save
them
a
little
more
each
day
from
error
and
falsehood
that
lent
him
so
much
calmness
and
enabled
him
to
await
the
blow
he
expected
with
a
quiet
smile
like
one
who
every
evening
felt
well
satisfied
with
the
work
accomplished
during
the
day
at
last
one
morning
petit
announced
that
the
revocation
of
ignoble
poisoner
of
maillebois
was
signed
on
the
previous
day
marc
had
heard
of
a
fresh
visit
which
the
count
de
sanglebœuf
had
paid
to
the
préfecture
and
he
ceased
to
hope
his
ruin
was
about
to
be
consummated
the
evening
proved
a
very
trying
one
whenever
he
quitted
his
classroom
and
his
boys
with
their
smiling
faces
and
their
fair
and
their
dark
little
pates
were
no
longer
near
to
remind
him
of
the
good
time
coming
he
sank
into
sadness
and
only
after
a
struggle
recovered
the
courage
which
he
needed
for
the
morrow
and
so
that
particular
evening
proved
particularly
bitter
he
thought
of
his
work
destined
to
be
so
brutally
interrupted
of
those
boys
whom
he
had
taught
perhaps
for
the
last
time
and
whom
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
save
they
would
be
taken
from
him
handed
over
to
some
deformer
of
intellect
and
character
and
it
was
the
wreck
of
his
ministry
that
made
his
heart
bleed
he
went
to
bed
in
such
a
gloomy
mood
that
geneviève
gently
silently
cast
her
arms
about
him
as
she
still
did
occasionally
from
an
impulse
of
wifely
affection
are
worried
are
you
not
my
poor
darling
she
whispered
he
did
not
answer
immediately
he
knew
that
she
shared
his
views
less
than
ever
and
he
always
avoided
painful
explanations
in
spite
of
his
secret
remorse
at
allowing
her
to
drift
away
from
him
without
attempting
an
effort
to
make
her
wholly
his
own
indeed
if
he
himself
had
again
ceased
to
call
on
her
mother
and
grandmother
he
lacked
the
courage
to
forbid
her
visits
to
that
icy
little
house
though
he
well
divined
that
their
happiness
was
greatly
endangered
there
each
time
that
geneviève
returned
from
the
place
des
capucins
he
felt
that
she
belonged
to
him
a
little
less
than
before
recently
while
the
whole
clerical
pack
was
barking
at
his
heels
he
had
learnt
that
the
ladies
had
denied
him
on
every
side
blushing
for
their
connection
as
if
it
were
some
unmerited
shame
that
soiled
their
family
do
you
answer
me
dear
geneviève
began
again
you
think
that
i
share
your
sorrow
he
felt
touched
and
returning
her
embrace
replied
i
am
grieved
but
it
is
about
matters
in
which
you
do
not
feel
as
i
do
and
as
i
do
wish
to
reproach
you
what
is
the
use
of
confiding
them
to
you
still
i
may
say
i
fear
that
in
a
few
days
we
shall
be
here
no
longer
is
that
i
shall
certainly
be
sent
elsewhere
if
i
am
not
dismissed
altogether
it
is
all
over
and
we
shall
have
to
go
away
i
know
not
whither
she
raised
a
cry
of
delight
my
dear
so
much
the
better
that
is
the
best
thing
that
can
happen
to
us
he
felt
astonished
for
her
meaning
at
first
escaped
him
and
when
he
questioned
her
she
seemed
somewhat
embarrassed
and
endeavoured
to
recall
her
words
i
say
that
because
of
course
it
would
be
all
the
same
to
me
if
i
did
have
to
go
away
with
you
and
our
louise
one
may
be
happy
anywhere
but
when
he
pressed
her
she
added
if
we
went
elsewhere
we
should
no
longer
be
worried
by
all
the
horrid
things
which
go
on
here
and
which
might
end
by
making
us
quarrel
i
should
be
so
happy
if
we
could
be
alone
in
some
little
nook
where
nobody
would
come
between
us
where
nothing
from
outside
would
try
to
separate
us
oh
let
us
go
away
dear
several
times
already
in
moments
of
affectionate
marc
had
noticed
in
his
wife
that
same
dread
of
rupture
that
desire
that
need
to
remain
wholly
his
it
was
as
if
she
said
to
him
me
on
your
heart
carry
me
away
so
that
none
may
tear
me
from
your
arms
i
feel
that
i
am
being
parted
from
you
a
little
more
each
day
i
shiver
with
the
great
chill
which
comes
over
me
when
i
am
no
longer
in
your
embrace
and
with
his
dread
of
the
inevitable
nothing
could
have
upset
him
more
away
my
love
he
answered
is
not
enough
to
go
away
but
what
joy
you
give
me
and
how
grateful
i
feel
to
you
for
comforting
me
like
that
several
more
days
elapsed
and
still
the
terrible
letter
expected
from
the
préfecture
did
not
arrive
no
doubt
this
was
due
to
the
fact
that
a
fresh
incident
began
to
impassion
the
district
and
divert
public
attention
from
the
secular
school
of
maillebois
for
some
time
past
abbé
cognasse
of
jonville
whose
triumph
was
complete
had
been
meditating
a
great
stroke
striving
to
induce
mayor
martineau
to
allow
the
parish
to
be
consecrated
to
the
sacred
heart
of
jesus
in
all
likelihood
the
idea
had
not
come
from
the
abbé
himself
for
every
thursday
morning
during
the
previous
month
he
had
been
seen
going
to
the
college
of
valmarie
where
he
had
long
conferences
with
father
crabot
and
a
remark
made
by
férou
the
schoolmaster
at
le
moreux
was
circulating
filling
some
folk
with
indignation
and
amusing
others
those
dirty
jesuits
bring
their
bullock
heart
here
i
will
spit
in
their
faces
he
had
said
henceforth
the
worship
of
the
sacred
heart
was
absorbing
the
whole
christian
faith
developing
into
a
new
incarnation
a
new
catholicism
the
sickly
vision
of
a
poor
creature
stricken
with
hysteria
the
sad
and
ardent
marie
alacoque
that
real
gory
heart
half
wrenched
from
an
open
bosom
was
becoming
the
symbol
of
a
baser
faith
degraded
lowered
to
supply
a
need
of
carnal
satisfaction
the
ancient
and
pure
worship
of
an
immaterial
jesus
who
had
risen
on
high
to
join
the
father
seemed
to
have
become
too
delicate
for
modern
souls
lusting
for
terrestrial
enjoyment
and
it
had
been
resolved
to
serve
the
very
flesh
of
jesus
his
heart
of
flesh
to
devotees
by
way
of
daily
sustenance
such
as
superstition
and
brutishness
required
it
was
like
a
premeditated
onslaught
on
human
reason
an
intentional
degradation
of
the
religion
of
former
times
in
order
that
the
mass
of
believers
bowed
beneath
the
weight
of
falsehood
might
become
yet
more
stupefied
and
more
servile
with
the
religion
of
the
sacred
heart
only
tribes
of
idolaters
were
left
fetichists
who
adored
offal
from
a
and
carried
it
on
a
and
all
the
genius
of
the
jesuits
was
found
therein
the
humanisation
of
religion
god
coming
to
man
since
centuries
of
effort
had
failed
to
lead
man
to
god
it
was
necessary
to
give
the
ignorant
multitude
the
only
deity
it
understood
one
made
in
its
own
image
gory
and
dolorous
like
itself
an
idol
of
violent
hues
whose
brutish
materiality
would
complete
the
transformation
of
the
faithful
into
a
herd
of
fat
beasts
fit
for
slaughter
all
conquests
effected
on
reason
are
conquests
effected
on
liberty
and
it
had
become
necessary
to
reduce
france
to
that
savage
worship
of
the
sacred
heart
fit
for
the
aborigines
of
some
undiscovered
continent
in
order
to
hold
it
in
submission
beneath
the
imbecility
of
the
church
dogmas
the
first
attempts
had
been
made
on
the
very
morrow
of
the
great
defeats
amid
the
grief
arising
from
the
loss
of
the
two
provinces
then
already
the
church
had
availed
herself
of
the
public
confusion
to
endeavour
to
consecrate
france
to
the
sacred
heart
france
which
after
being
chastised
so
heavily
by
the
hand
of
god
repented
of
her
sins
and
at
last
on
the
highest
summit
of
that
great
revolutionary
city
of
paris
the
church
had
reared
that
sacred
heart
palpitating
and
gory
red
like
the
hearts
which
one
sees
hanging
from
hooks
in
shops
from
that
summit
it
bled
over
the
entire
land
to
the
farthest
depths
of
the
country
districts
and
if
at
montmartre
it
kindled
the
adoration
of
the
gentility
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
belonging
to
the
administrative
services
the
magistracy
and
the
army
with
what
emotion
must
it
not
infect
the
simple
the
ignorant
and
the
devout
of
the
villages
and
hamlets
it
became
the
national
emblem
of
repentance
of
the
country
in
the
hands
of
the
church
it
was
embroidered
in
the
centre
of
the
tricolor
flag
whose
three
colours
became
mere
symbols
of
the
azure
of
heaven
the
lilies
of
the
virgin
and
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
and
huge
swollen
and
streaming
with
gore
it
hung
thus
like
the
new
deity
of
degenerate
catholicism
offered
to
the
base
superstition
of
enslaved
france
at
first
it
had
been
father
crabot
idea
to
triumph
at
maillebois
the
chief
place
in
the
canton
by
consecrating
that
little
town
to
the
sacred
heart
but
he
had
become
anxious
for
at
maillebois
there
was
a
manufacturing
suburb
inhabited
by
some
hundreds
of
working
men
who
were
beginning
to
send
socialist
representatives
to
the
municipal
council
thus
in
spite
of
the
brothers
and
the
capuchins
he
had
feared
some
sensational
repulse
all
considered
it
was
better
to
act
at
jonville
where
the
ground
appeared
well
prepared
if
successful
there
one
might
always
repeat
the
experiment
on
a
larger
stage
some
other
time
abbé
cognasse
now
reigned
at
jonville
which
schoolmaster
jauffre
had
gradually
handed
over
to
him
jauffre
guiding
principle
was
a
very
simple
one
as
clericalism
was
sweeping
through
the
region
why
should
he
not
allow
it
to
waft
him
to
the
headmastership
of
some
important
school
at
beaumont
thus
after
prompting
his
wife
to
make
advances
to
the
parish
priest
he
himself
had
openly
gone
over
to
the
church
ringing
the
bell
chanting
at
the
offices
taking
his
pupils
to
mass
every
sunday
mayor
martineau
who
following
marc
had
been
an
in
former
times
was
at
first
upset
by
the
new
schoolmaster
doings
but
what
could
he
say
to
a
man
who
was
so
well
off
and
who
explained
so
plausibly
that
it
was
wrong
to
be
against
the
priests
thus
martineau
was
shaken
in
his
ideas
and
allowed
the
other
to
follow
his
course
till
at
last
prompted
thereto
by
the
beautiful
madame
martineau
he
himself
declared
to
the
parish
council
that
it
was
best
to
live
in
agreement
with
the
curé
after
that
a
year
sufficed
for
abbé
cognasse
to
become
the
absolute
master
of
the
parish
his
influence
no
longer
being
counterbalanced
by
that
of
the
schoolmaster
who
indeed
willingly
walked
behind
him
confident
that
he
would
derive
a
handsome
profit
from
his
submissiveness
nevertheless
when
the
idea
of
consecrating
jonville
to
the
sacred
heart
was
propounded
some
dismay
and
resistance
arose
nobody
knew
whence
that
idea
had
come
nobody
could
have
said
by
whom
it
had
been
first
mooted
however
abbé
cognasse
with
his
eager
militant
nature
immediately
made
it
his
business
in
the
hope
of
gaining
great
personal
glory
should
he
be
the
first
priest
of
the
region
to
win
an
entire
parish
over
to
god
he
made
such
a
stir
indeed
that
monseigneur
bergerot
in
despair
at
the
threat
of
a
new
superstition
and
grieved
by
its
base
idolatry
summoned
him
to
beaumont
where
however
after
a
scene
which
proved
it
was
rumoured
both
terrible
and
pathetic
the
bishop
once
again
was
compelled
to
give
way
but
on
two
occasions
the
parish
council
of
jonville
held
tumultuous
meetings
several
members
angrily
desiring
to
know
what
profit
they
would
all
derive
from
the
consecration
of
the
parish
to
the
sacred
heart
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
the
affair
were
condemned
and
buried
but
jauffre
also
made
a
trip
to
beaumont
and
though
nobody
guessed
exactly
what
personage
he
saw
there
he
no
sooner
came
back
than
in
a
gentle
insidious
manner
he
resumed
the
negotiations
with
the
parish
council
the
question
was
what
the
parish
would
gain
by
consecrating
itself
to
the
sacred
heart
well
first
of
all
several
ladies
of
beaumont
promised
presents
to
the
church
a
silver
chalice
an
altar
cloth
some
flower
vases
and
a
big
statue
of
the
saviour
with
a
huge
flaming
bleeding
heart
painted
on
it
then
too
said
jauffre
there
was
talk
of
giving
a
dowry
of
five
hundred
francs
to
the
most
deserving
maiden
of
the
virgin
when
she
married
but
the
council
seemed
to
be
most
impressed
by
the
promise
of
setting
up
a
branch
establishment
of
the
order
of
the
good
shepherd
where
two
hundred
girls
would
work
at
fine
linen
chemises
petticoats
and
knickers
for
some
of
the
great
parisian
shops
the
peasants
at
once
pictured
all
their
daughters
working
for
the
good
sisters
and
speculated
on
the
large
amount
of
money
which
such
an
establishment
would
probably
bring
into
the
district
at
last
it
was
decided
that
the
ceremony
should
take
place
on
june
a
sunday
and
as
abbé
cognasse
pointed
out
never
was
festival
favoured
by
brighter
sunshine
for
three
days
his
servant
the
terrible
palmyre
with
the
help
of
madame
jauffre
and
the
beautiful
madame
martineau
had
been
decorating
the
church
with
evergreens
and
hangings
lent
by
the
inhabitants
the
ladies
of
beaumont
présidente
gragnon
générale
jarousse
préfete
hennebise
and
even
so
it
was
said
madame
lemarrois
the
wife
of
the
radical
mayor
and
deputy
had
presented
the
parish
with
a
superb
tricolor
flag
on
which
the
sacred
heart
was
embroidered
with
the
motto
and
country
and
jauffre
himself
was
to
carry
that
flag
walking
on
the
right
hand
of
the
mayor
of
jonville
an
extraordinary
concourse
of
important
personages
arrived
during
the
morning
many
notabilities
of
beaumont
with
the
ladies
who
had
presented
the
flag
philis
the
mayor
of
maillebois
with
the
clerical
majority
of
his
council
as
well
as
a
shoal
of
cassocks
and
frocks
a
delegated
by
monseigneur
the
bishop
father
théodose
and
other
capuchins
brother
fulgence
and
his
assistant
brothers
father
philibin
and
even
father
crabot
both
of
whom
were
surrounded
and
saluted
with
the
greatest
deference
but
people
noticed
the
absence
of
abbé
quandieu
who
according
to
his
own
account
had
been
laid
up
by
a
violent
attack
of
gout
at
the
last
moment
at
three
in
the
afternoon
a
band
of
music
which
had
come
from
the
chief
town
struck
up
an
heroic
march
on
the
place
de
then
appeared
the
parish
councillors
all
wearing
their
scarves
and
headed
by
mayor
martineau
and
schoolmaster
jauffre
the
latter
of
whom
grasped
the
staff
of
his
flag
with
both
hands
a
halt
ensued
until
the
band
had
finished
playing
a
dense
crowd
of
peasant
families
in
their
sunday
best
and
ladies
in
full
dress
had
gathered
round
waiting
then
all
at
once
the
principal
door
of
the
church
was
thrown
wide
open
and
curé
cognasse
appeared
in
rich
sacerdotal
vestments
followed
by
numerous
members
of
the
clergy
the
many
priests
who
had
hastened
to
jonville
from
surrounding
spots
chants
arose
and
all
the
people
prostrated
themselves
devoutly
during
the
solemn
blessing
of
the
flag
the
pathetic
moment
came
when
mayor
martineau
and
the
members
of
the
council
knelt
beneath
the
folds
of
the
symbolic
standard
which
jauffre
held
slantwise
above
them
in
order
that
one
might
the
better
see
the
gory
heart
embroidered
amid
the
three
colours
and
then
in
a
loud
voice
the
mayor
read
the
deed
officially
consecrating
the
parish
of
jonville
to
that
heart
women
wept
and
men
applauded
a
gust
of
blissful
insanity
arose
into
the
clear
sunlight
above
the
blare
of
the
brass
instruments
and
the
beating
of
the
drums
which
had
again
struck
up
a
triumphal
march
and
the
procession
entered
the
church
the
clergy
the
mayor
and
the
council
still
and
ever
attended
by
the
schoolmaster
and
the
flag
then
came
the
benediction
of
the
holy
sacrament
the
monstrance
glittering
like
a
great
star
on
the
altar
amid
all
the
lighted
candles
while
the
municipality
again
knelt
down
most
devoutly
and
afterwards
abbé
cognasse
began
to
speak
with
fiery
eloquence
exulting
at
the
sight
of
the
representatives
of
civil
authority
sheltering
themselves
beneath
the
banner
of
the
sacred
heart
prostrating
themselves
before
the
holy
sacrament
abdicating
all
pride
and
rebellion
in
the
hands
of
the
deity
relying
on
him
alone
to
govern
and
save
france
did
not
this
signify
the
end
of
impiety
the
church
mistress
of
men
souls
and
bodies
sole
representative
of
power
and
authority
on
earth
ah
she
would
not
long
delay
to
restore
happiness
to
her
eldest
daughter
who
at
last
repented
of
her
errors
submitted
and
sought
nothing
but
salvation
every
parish
would
end
by
following
the
example
of
jonville
the
whole
country
would
give
itself
to
the
sacred
heart
france
would
recover
her
empire
over
the
world
by
the
worship
of
the
national
flag
now
transformed
into
the
flag
of
jesus
cries
of
ecstatic
intoxication
burst
forth
and
the
splendid
ceremony
came
to
an
end
in
the
sacristy
whither
the
council
headed
by
the
mayor
repaired
to
sign
the
deed
on
parchment
which
set
forth
that
the
whole
parish
of
jonville
had
for
ever
consecrated
itself
to
the
divine
heart
the
civil
power
piously
renouncing
its
claims
in
favour
of
the
religious
power
but
when
the
party
quitted
the
church
a
scandalous
scene
occurred
among
the
crowd
was
férou
the
schoolmaster
at
le
moreux
clad
in
a
wretched
tattered
frock
coat
and
looking
more
emaciated
more
ardent
than
ever
he
had
sunk
to
the
worst
tortures
of
indebtedness
he
was
pursued
for
francs
and
half
francs
which
he
had
borrowed
for
he
could
no
longer
obtain
on
credit
the
six
pounds
of
bread
which
he
needed
daily
to
feed
his
exhausted
wife
and
his
three
lean
and
ailing
daughters
even
before
it
was
due
his
paltry
salary
of
a
hundred
francs
a
month
disappeared
in
that
gulf
and
the
little
sum
which
he
received
as
parish
clerk
was
constantly
being
attached
by
creditors
his
growing
and
incurable
misery
had
increased
the
contempt
of
the
peasants
who
were
all
at
their
ease
and
who
looked
askance
at
knowledge
as
it
did
not
even
feed
the
master
appointed
to
teach
it
and
férou
the
only
man
of
intelligence
and
culture
in
that
abode
of
dense
ignorance
grew
more
and
more
exasperated
at
the
thought
that
he
the
man
who
knew
should
be
the
poor
one
whereas
the
ignorant
were
rich
feverish
rebellion
against
such
social
iniquity
came
upon
him
he
was
maddened
by
the
sufferings
of
those
who
were
dear
to
him
and
dreamt
of
destroying
this
abominable
world
by
violence
as
he
stood
there
he
caught
sight
of
saleur
the
mayor
of
le
moreux
who
wishing
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
the
triumphant
abbé
cognasse
had
come
over
to
jonville
arrayed
in
a
fine
new
frock
coat
peace
now
reigned
between
his
parish
and
the
priest
though
the
latter
still
grumbled
at
having
to
walk
several
miles
to
say
mass
for
people
who
might
very
well
have
kept
a
priest
of
their
own
however
all
the
esteem
which
had
departed
from
the
thin
ghastly
penniless
and
deeply
indebted
schoolmaster
had
now
gone
to
the
sturdy
and
flourishing
priest
who
was
so
much
better
off
and
who
turned
every
baptism
wedding
and
burial
into
so
much
money
beaten
as
was
only
natural
in
that
unequal
duel
férou
was
no
longer
able
to
control
his
rage
monsieur
saleur
he
exclaimed
a
carnival
and
no
mistake
are
you
ashamed
to
lend
yourself
to
such
ignominy
though
saleur
was
not
at
heart
with
the
priests
this
remark
vexed
him
he
construed
it
as
an
attack
upon
his
own
position
as
an
enriched
grazier
living
on
his
income
in
a
pretty
house
repainted
and
decorated
at
his
own
expense
so
he
sought
for
dignified
words
of
reprimand
would
do
better
to
keep
quiet
monsieur
férou
the
shame
belongs
to
those
who
ca
even
succeed
sufficiently
to
lead
respectable
lives
irritated
by
this
rejoinder
which
smacked
of
the
low
standard
of
morality
that
brought
him
so
much
suffering
férou
was
about
to
reply
when
his
anger
was
diverted
by
the
sight
of
jauffre
colleague
said
he
it
you
who
carry
their
banner
of
falsehood
and
imbecility
that
a
fine
action
for
an
educator
of
the
lowly
and
humble
ones
of
our
democracy
you
know
very
well
that
the
priest
gain
is
the
schoolmaster
loss
jauffre
like
a
man
who
had
an
income
of
his
own
and
who
moreover
was
well
pleased
with
what
he
had
done
replied
with
compassionate
yet
crushing
contempt
judging
others
my
poor
comrade
you
would
do
well
to
provide
your
daughters
with
shifts
to
hide
their
nakedness
at
this
férou
lost
all
with
his
unkempt
hair
bristling
on
his
head
and
a
savage
gleam
in
his
wild
eyes
he
waved
his
long
arms
and
cried
gang
of
bigots
you
pack
of
jesuits
carry
your
bullock
heart
about
worship
it
eat
it
raw
and
become
if
you
can
even
more
bestial
and
imbecile
than
you
are
already
a
crowd
gathered
around
the
blasphemer
hoots
and
threats
arose
and
things
would
have
turned
out
badly
for
him
if
saleur
like
a
prudent
mayor
alarmed
for
the
good
name
of
his
commune
had
not
extricated
him
from
the
hostile
throng
and
led
him
away
by
the
arm
on
the
morrow
the
incident
was
greatly
exaggerated
on
all
sides
people
talked
of
execrable
sacrilege
indeed
petit
related
that
the
schoolmaster
of
le
moreux
had
spat
on
the
national
flag
of
the
sacred
heart
at
the
very
moment
when
worthy
abbé
cognasse
was
blessing
that
divine
emblem
of
repentant
and
rescued
france
and
in
its
ensuing
number
it
announced
that
the
revocation
of
schoolmaster
férou
was
a
certainty
if
that
were
so
the
consequences
would
be
serious
for
as
férou
had
not
completed
his
term
of
ten
years
duty
as
a
teacher
he
would
have
to
perform
some
years
military
service
and
again
while
he
was
in
barracks
what
would
become
of
his
wife
and
daughters
those
woeful
creatures
for
whom
he
was
already
unable
to
provide
he
gone
would
they
not
utterly
starve
to
death
when
marc
heard
of
what
had
happened
he
went
to
see
salvan
at
beaumont
this
time
the
newspaper
information
was
correct
the
revocation
of
férou
was
about
to
be
signed
le
barazer
was
resolved
on
it
and
as
marc
nevertheless
begged
his
old
friend
to
attempt
some
intervention
the
other
sadly
refused
to
do
so
no
it
would
be
useless
he
said
should
simply
encounter
inflexible
determination
le
barazer
can
not
act
otherwise
at
least
such
is
his
conviction
opportunist
as
he
is
he
finds
in
that
course
a
means
of
ridding
himself
of
the
other
difficulties
of
the
present
time
and
you
must
not
complain
too
much
for
if
his
severity
falls
on
férou
it
is
in
order
that
he
may
spare
you
at
this
marc
burst
into
protest
saying
how
much
he
was
upset
and
grieved
by
such
a
you
are
not
responsible
my
dear
fellow
salvan
replied
is
casting
that
prey
to
the
clericals
because
they
require
one
and
because
he
thus
hopes
to
save
a
good
workman
like
yourself
it
is
a
very
solution
as
somebody
said
to
me
yesterday
ah
how
many
tears
and
how
much
blood
must
necessarily
flow
for
the
slightest
progress
to
be
accomplished
how
many
poor
corpses
must
fill
up
the
ditches
in
order
that
the
heroes
may
pass
on
salvan
forecast
was
fulfilled
to
the
very
letter
two
days
afterwards
férou
was
dismissed
and
rather
than
resign
himself
to
military
service
he
fled
to
belgium
full
of
exasperation
at
the
thought
that
justice
should
be
denied
him
he
hoped
to
find
some
petty
situation
at
brussels
which
would
enable
him
to
send
for
his
wife
and
children
and
make
himself
a
new
home
abroad
he
even
ended
by
declaring
that
he
felt
relieved
at
having
escaped
from
the
university
galleys
and
that
he
now
breathed
freely
like
a
man
who
was
at
last
at
liberty
to
think
and
act
as
he
listed
meantime
his
wife
installed
herself
with
her
three
little
girls
in
two
small
sordid
rooms
at
maillebois
where
with
all
bravery
she
at
once
began
to
ply
her
needle
as
a
seamstress
though
she
found
herself
unable
to
earn
enough
for
daily
bread
marc
visited
her
and
helped
her
as
far
as
he
could
feeling
quite
heartbroken
at
the
sight
of
her
pitiable
wretchedness
and
a
remorseful
feeling
clung
to
him
for
the
affair
of
the
crucifix
appeared
to
be
forgotten
amid
the
keen
emotion
roused
by
the
sacrilege
of
jonville
and
the
revocation
which
had
followed
it
petit
triumphed
noisily
and
the
count
de
sanglebœuf
promenaded
the
town
with
victorious
airs
as
if
his
friends
the
brothers
the
capuchins
and
the
jesuits
had
now
become
the
absolute
masters
of
the
department
and
then
life
followed
its
course
pending
the
time
when
the
struggle
would
begin
again
on
another
field
one
sunday
marc
was
surprised
to
see
his
wife
come
home
carrying
a
have
you
been
to
church
he
asked
her
she
answered
i
have
just
taken
the
communion
he
looked
at
her
turning
pale
the
while
penetrated
by
a
sudden
chill
a
quiver
which
he
strove
to
hide
do
that
now
and
you
did
not
tell
me
of
it
said
he
on
her
side
she
feigned
astonishment
though
according
to
her
wont
she
remained
very
calm
and
gentle
you
of
it
why
she
asked
is
a
matter
of
conscience
i
leave
you
free
to
act
according
to
your
views
so
i
suppose
i
may
act
according
to
mine
doubt
all
the
same
for
the
sake
of
a
good
understanding
between
us
i
should
have
liked
to
have
known
you
know
now
i
do
not
hide
it
as
you
may
see
but
we
shall
none
the
less
remain
good
friends
i
hope
she
added
nothing
more
and
he
lacked
the
strength
to
tell
her
of
all
that
he
felt
seething
within
him
to
provoke
the
explanation
which
he
knew
to
be
imperative
but
the
day
remained
heavy
with
silence
this
time
some
connecting
link
had
certainly
snapped
and
sundered
them
iii
some
months
elapsed
and
day
by
day
marc
found
himself
confronted
by
the
redoubtable
question
why
had
he
married
a
woman
whose
belief
was
contrary
to
his
own
did
not
he
and
geneviève
belong
to
two
hostile
spheres
divided
by
an
abyss
and
would
not
their
disagreement
bring
them
the
most
frightful
torture
some
scientists
were
suggesting
that
when
people
desired
to
marry
they
should
undergo
proper
examination
and
provide
themselves
with
certificates
setting
forth
that
they
were
free
from
all
physical
flaws
the
young
man
for
his
part
felt
convinced
that
all
such
certificates
ought
also
to
state
that
the
holder
heart
and
mind
were
free
from
every
form
of
inherited
or
acquired
imbecility
two
beings
ignorant
one
of
the
other
coming
from
different
worlds
as
it
were
with
contradictory
and
hostile
notions
could
only
torture
and
destroy
each
other
and
yet
how
great
an
excuse
was
at
the
outset
furnished
by
the
imperious
blindness
of
love
and
how
difficult
it
was
to
solve
the
question
in
some
particular
cases
which
were
often
those
instinct
with
most
charm
and
tenderness
marc
did
not
yet
accuse
geneviève
he
merely
dreaded
lest
she
should
become
a
deadly
weapon
in
the
hands
of
those
priests
and
monks
against
whom
he
was
waging
war
as
the
church
had
failed
to
strike
him
down
by
intriguing
with
his
superiors
it
must
now
be
thinking
of
dealing
him
a
blow
in
the
heart
by
destroying
his
domestic
happiness
that
was
essentially
the
device
of
the
jesuits
the
everlasting
manœuvre
of
the
who
helps
on
the
work
of
catholic
domination
in
stealthy
fashion
like
a
worldly
psychologist
well
acquainted
with
the
passions
and
the
means
they
offer
for
triumphing
over
the
human
beast
who
fondled
and
satiated
may
then
be
strangled
to
glide
into
a
home
to
set
oneself
between
husband
and
wife
to
capture
the
latter
and
thereby
destroy
the
man
whom
the
church
wishes
to
get
rid
of
no
easier
and
more
widely
adopted
stratagem
than
this
is
known
to
the
black
whisperers
of
the
confessional
the
church
having
taken
possession
of
woman
has
used
her
as
its
most
powerful
weapon
of
propaganda
and
enthralment
at
the
first
moment
an
obstacle
certainly
arose
was
not
woman
all
shame
and
perdition
a
creature
of
sin
and
terror
before
whom
the
very
saints
trembled
vile
nature
had
set
its
trap
in
her
she
was
the
source
of
life
she
was
life
itself
the
contempt
of
which
was
taught
by
the
church
and
so
for
a
moment
the
latter
denied
a
soul
to
woman
the
creature
from
whom
men
of
purity
fled
to
the
desert
in
danger
of
succumbing
if
the
evening
breeze
wafted
to
them
merely
the
odour
of
her
hair
beauty
and
passion
being
cast
out
of
the
religious
system
she
became
the
mere
embodiment
of
all
that
was
condemned
all
that
was
regarded
as
diabolical
denounced
as
the
craft
of
satan
all
against
which
prayer
mortification
and
strict
and
perpetual
chastity
were
enjoined
and
in
the
desire
to
crush
sexuality
in
woman
the
ideal
woman
was
shown
sexless
and
a
virgin
was
enthroned
as
queen
of
heaven
but
the
church
ended
by
understanding
the
irresistible
sexual
power
of
woman
over
man
and
in
spite
of
its
repugnance
in
spite
of
its
terror
decided
to
employ
it
as
a
means
to
conquer
and
enchain
man
that
great
flock
of
women
weakened
by
an
abasing
system
of
education
terrorised
by
the
fear
of
hell
degraded
to
the
status
of
serfs
by
the
hatred
and
harshness
of
priests
might
serve
as
an
army
and
as
man
was
ceasing
to
believe
and
turning
aside
from
the
altars
an
effort
to
bring
him
back
to
them
might
be
attempted
with
the
help
of
woman
satanic
but
ever
victorious
charm
she
need
only
withhold
herself
from
man
and
he
would
follow
her
to
the
very
foot
of
the
shrines
in
this
no
doubt
there
was
much
immoral
inconsistency
but
had
not
the
church
lost
much
of
its
primitive
sternness
and
had
not
the
jesuits
appeared
upon
the
scene
to
fight
the
great
fight
on
the
new
field
of
casuistry
and
accommodation
with
the
world
from
that
time
then
the
church
handled
woman
more
gently
and
skilfully
than
before
it
still
refused
to
take
her
to
wife
for
it
feared
and
loathed
her
as
the
embodiment
of
sin
but
it
employed
her
to
ensure
its
triumph
its
policy
was
to
keep
her
to
itself
by
stupefying
her
as
formerly
by
holding
her
in
a
state
of
perpetual
mental
infancy
that
much
ensured
it
turned
her
into
a
weapon
of
war
confident
that
it
would
vanquish
incredulous
man
by
setting
pious
woman
before
him
and
in
woman
the
church
always
had
a
witness
at
the
family
hearth
and
was
able
to
exert
its
influence
even
in
the
most
intimate
moments
of
conjugal
life
whenever
it
desired
to
plunge
resisting
men
into
the
worst
despair
thus
at
bottom
woman
still
remained
the
human
animal
and
the
priests
merely
made
use
of
her
in
order
to
ensure
the
triumph
of
their
creed
marc
easily
reconstituted
the
early
phases
of
geneviève
life
in
childhood
the
pleasant
convent
of
the
sisters
of
the
visitation
with
all
sorts
of
devout
attractions
the
evening
prayer
on
one
knees
beside
the
little
white
bed
the
providential
protection
promised
to
those
who
were
obedient
the
lovely
stories
of
christians
saved
from
lions
of
guardian
angels
watching
over
children
and
carrying
the
pure
souls
of
the
to
heaven
such
indeed
as
monsieur
le
curé
related
in
the
dazzling
chapel
afterwards
came
years
of
skilful
preparation
for
the
first
communion
with
the
extraordinary
mysteries
of
the
catechism
enshrouded
in
fearsome
obscurity
for
ever
disturbing
the
reason
and
kindling
all
the
perverse
fever
of
mystical
curiosity
then
in
the
first
troublous
hour
of
maidenhood
the
young
girl
enraptured
with
her
white
gown
her
first
bridal
gown
was
affianced
to
jesus
united
to
the
divine
lover
whose
gentle
sway
she
accepted
for
ever
and
man
might
come
afterwards
he
would
find
himself
forestalled
by
an
influence
which
would
dispute
his
possession
of
her
with
all
the
haunting
force
of
remembrance
again
and
again
throughout
her
life
woman
would
see
the
candles
sparkling
feel
the
incense
filling
her
with
languor
hark
back
to
the
wakening
of
her
senses
amid
the
mysterious
whispering
of
the
confessional
and
the
languishing
rapture
of
the
holy
table
she
would
spend
her
youth
encompassed
by
the
worst
prejudices
nourished
with
the
errors
and
falsehoods
of
ages
and
above
all
things
kept
in
close
captivity
in
order
that
nothing
of
the
real
world
might
reach
her
thus
the
girl
of
sixteen
or
seventeen
on
quitting
the
good
sisters
of
the
visitation
was
a
miracle
of
perversion
and
stultification
one
whose
natural
vision
had
been
dimmed
one
who
knew
nothing
of
herself
nor
of
others
and
who
in
the
part
she
would
play
in
love
and
wifehood
would
bring
apart
from
her
beauty
nought
save
religious
poison
the
evil
ferment
of
every
disorder
and
every
suffering
marc
pictured
geneviève
somewhat
later
in
the
devout
little
house
on
the
place
des
capucins
it
was
there
that
he
had
first
seen
her
in
the
charge
of
her
grandmother
and
mother
the
chief
care
of
whose
vigilant
affection
had
been
to
complete
the
convent
work
by
setting
on
one
side
everything
that
might
have
made
the
girl
a
creature
of
truth
and
reason
it
was
enough
that
she
should
follow
the
church
observances
like
an
obedient
worshipper
she
was
told
that
she
need
take
no
interest
in
other
things
she
was
prepared
for
life
by
being
kept
quite
blind
to
it
some
effort
on
marc
part
was
already
necessary
to
enable
him
to
recall
her
such
as
she
had
been
at
the
time
of
their
first
interviews
delightfully
fair
with
a
refined
and
gentle
face
so
desirable
too
with
the
flush
of
her
youth
the
penetrating
perfume
of
her
blond
beauty
that
he
only
vaguely
remembered
whether
she
had
then
shown
much
intelligence
and
sense
a
gust
of
passion
had
transported
them
both
he
had
felt
that
she
shared
his
flame
for
however
chilling
might
have
been
her
education
she
had
inherited
from
her
father
a
real
craving
for
love
in
matters
of
intellect
she
was
doubtless
no
fool
he
must
have
deemed
her
similar
to
other
young
girls
of
whom
one
knows
nothing
and
certainly
he
had
resolved
to
look
into
all
that
after
their
marriage
but
when
he
now
recalled
their
first
years
at
jonville
he
perceived
how
slight
had
been
his
efforts
to
know
her
better
and
make
her
more
wholly
his
own
they
had
spent
those
years
in
mutual
rapture
in
such
passionate
intoxication
that
they
had
remained
unconscious
even
of
their
moral
differences
she
showed
real
intelligence
in
many
things
and
he
had
not
cared
to
worry
her
about
the
singular
gaps
which
he
had
occasionally
discovered
in
her
understanding
as
she
ceased
to
follow
the
observances
of
the
church
he
imagined
that
he
had
won
her
over
to
his
views
though
he
had
not
even
taken
the
trouble
to
instruct
her
in
them
he
now
suspected
that
there
must
have
been
some
little
cowardice
on
his
part
some
dislike
of
the
bother
of
her
entirely
and
also
some
fear
of
encountering
obstacles
and
spoiling
the
adorable
quietude
of
their
love
indeed
as
their
life
was
all
happiness
why
should
he
have
sought
a
cause
of
strife
particularly
as
he
had
felt
convinced
that
their
great
love
would
suffice
to
ensure
their
good
understanding
whatever
might
arise
but
now
the
crisis
was
at
hand
heavy
with
menace
when
salvan
had
interested
himself
in
the
marriage
he
had
pointed
out
to
marc
that
if
husband
and
wife
were
there
was
always
some
fear
for
the
future
and
to
tranquillise
his
own
conscience
with
respect
to
the
young
man
case
it
had
been
necessary
that
he
should
accept
the
view
adopted
by
marc
that
when
a
young
couple
adored
one
another
it
was
possible
for
the
husband
to
make
his
wife
such
as
he
desired
her
to
be
indeed
when
an
ignorant
young
girl
is
handed
over
to
a
man
whom
she
loves
is
it
not
in
his
power
to
her
in
his
own
image
he
is
her
god
and
may
mould
her
afresh
by
the
sovereign
might
of
love
such
is
the
theory
but
how
often
is
it
put
into
practice
languor
blindness
come
upon
the
man
himself
and
in
marc
case
it
was
only
long
afterwards
that
he
had
realised
how
ignorant
he
had
really
remained
of
geneviève
mind
a
mind
which
awaking
according
to
the
play
of
circumstances
revealed
itself
at
last
as
that
of
an
unknown
antagonistic
woman
the
effects
of
the
warm
bath
of
religiosity
in
which
geneviève
had
grown
up
were
still
there
the
adored
woman
whom
marc
had
imagined
to
be
wholly
his
own
was
possessed
by
the
indelible
indestructible
past
in
which
he
had
no
share
whatever
he
perceived
with
stupefaction
that
they
had
nothing
in
common
that
though
he
had
made
her
wife
and
mother
he
had
in
no
degree
modified
her
brain
fashioned
from
her
cradle
days
by
skilful
hands
ah
how
bitterly
he
now
regretted
that
in
the
first
months
of
their
married
life
he
had
not
striven
to
conquer
the
mind
that
existed
behind
the
charming
face
which
he
had
covered
with
his
kisses
he
ought
not
to
have
abandoned
himself
to
his
happiness
he
ought
to
have
striven
to
the
big
child
who
hung
so
amorously
about
his
neck
as
it
had
been
his
desire
to
make
her
entirely
his
own
why
had
he
not
shown
himself
a
prudent
sensible
man
whose
reason
remained
undisturbed
by
the
joys
of
love
if
he
suffered
now
it
was
by
reason
of
his
vain
illusions
his
idleness
and
his
egotism
in
refraining
from
action
from
the
fear
of
spoiling
the
felicity
of
his
dalliance
but
the
danger
had
now
become
so
serious
that
he
resolved
to
contend
with
it
a
last
excuse
for
avoiding
anything
like
rough
intervention
remained
to
him
respect
for
another
freedom
tolerance
of
whatever
might
be
the
sincere
faith
of
his
life
companion
with
amorous
weakness
he
had
consented
to
a
religious
marriage
and
subsequently
to
the
baptism
of
his
daughter
louise
and
in
the
same
way
he
now
lacked
the
strength
to
forbid
his
wife
attendance
at
mass
communion
and
confession
if
her
belief
lay
in
such
observances
yet
times
had
changed
he
might
have
pleaded
that
at
the
date
of
his
wedding
and
again
at
the
period
of
his
daughter
birth
he
had
been
quite
indifferent
to
church
matters
whereas
things
were
very
different
now
that
he
had
formally
rejected
the
church
and
its
creed
he
had
imposed
a
duty
on
himself
he
ought
to
set
an
example
he
ought
not
to
allow
in
his
own
home
that
which
he
condemned
in
the
homes
of
others
if
he
the
secular
schoolmaster
who
showed
such
marked
hostility
to
the
interference
of
priests
in
the
education
of
the
young
should
suffer
his
wife
to
go
to
mass
and
take
little
louise
with
her
would
he
not
render
himself
liable
to
reproach
nevertheless
he
did
not
feel
that
he
had
the
right
to
prevent
those
things
so
great
was
his
innate
respect
for
liberty
of
conscience
thus
confronted
as
he
was
by
the
imperious
necessity
of
defending
his
happiness
he
perceived
no
other
available
weapons
particularly
in
his
own
home
than
discussion
persuasion
and
the
daily
teaching
of
life
in
all
that
it
has
of
a
logical
and
healthful
nature
that
which
he
ought
to
have
done
at
the
outset
he
must
attempt
now
not
only
in
order
to
win
his
geneviève
over
to
healthy
human
truth
but
also
to
prevent
their
dear
louise
from
following
her
into
the
deadly
errors
of
roman
catholicism
for
the
moment
however
the
case
of
louise
now
seven
years
of
age
seemed
less
urgent
moreover
though
marc
was
convinced
that
a
child
first
impressions
are
the
keenest
and
the
most
tenacious
circumstances
compelled
a
waiting
policy
with
respect
to
his
little
girl
he
had
been
obliged
to
let
her
attend
the
neighbouring
school
where
mademoiselle
rouzaire
was
already
filling
her
mind
with
bible
history
there
were
also
prayers
at
the
beginning
and
at
the
end
of
lessons
sunday
attendance
at
mass
benedictions
and
processions
the
schoolmistress
had
certainly
bowed
assent
with
a
sharp
smile
when
marc
had
exacted
from
her
a
promise
that
his
daughter
should
not
be
required
to
follow
any
religious
exercises
but
the
girl
was
still
so
young
that
it
seemed
ridiculous
to
insist
on
preserving
her
from
contamination
in
this
fashion
besides
which
marc
was
not
always
at
hand
to
make
sure
whether
she
said
prayers
with
the
other
children
or
not
that
which
disgusted
him
with
mademoiselle
rouzaire
was
less
the
clerical
zeal
which
seemed
to
consume
her
than
her
hypocrisy
the
keen
personal
interest
which
guided
all
her
actions
the
woman
lack
of
real
faith
her
mere
exploitation
of
religious
sentimentality
for
her
own
advantage
was
so
apparent
that
even
geneviève
whose
uprightness
still
remained
entire
was
wounded
by
it
and
for
this
reason
had
repulsed
the
other
advances
the
schoolmistress
indeed
wishing
to
worm
her
way
into
marc
home
and
scenting
the
possibility
of
a
drama
there
had
suddenly
manifested
great
friendship
for
her
neighbour
what
delight
and
glory
it
would
be
if
she
could
render
the
church
a
service
in
that
direction
separate
the
wife
from
the
husband
and
strike
the
secular
schoolmaster
down
at
his
own
fireside
she
therefore
showed
herself
very
amiable
and
insinuating
ever
keeping
on
the
watch
behind
the
hoping
for
some
opportunity
which
would
enable
her
to
intervene
and
console
the
persecuted
little
wife
at
times
she
risked
allusions
expressions
of
sympathy
words
of
advice
was
so
sad
when
husband
and
wife
were
not
of
the
same
faith
and
assuredly
one
must
not
wreck
one
soul
so
it
was
best
to
offer
some
gentle
resistance
on
two
occasions
mademoiselle
rouzaire
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
geneviève
shed
tears
but
afterwards
the
young
wife
feeling
very
uneasy
drew
away
from
her
and
avoided
all
further
confidential
chats
that
woman
with
her
build
her
fondness
for
anisette
and
her
chatter
about
the
priests
after
all
were
not
different
from
other
men
and
of
whom
it
was
wrong
to
speak
badly
inspired
her
with
unconquerable
repugnance
thus
repulsed
mademoiselle
rouzaire
felt
her
hatred
for
her
neighbours
increase
and
visited
her
spite
on
little
louise
by
instructing
her
most
carefully
in
religious
matters
in
spite
of
the
paternal
prohibition
if
marc
was
not
seriously
concerned
as
yet
about
his
daughter
he
understood
that
it
was
urgent
he
should
act
in
order
to
prevent
his
beloved
geneviève
from
being
wrested
from
him
it
was
now
plain
to
him
that
her
religious
views
had
revived
at
her
grandmother
house
the
pious
little
home
on
the
place
des
capucins
was
like
a
of
mystical
contagion
where
a
faith
which
had
not
been
extinguished
but
which
had
died
down
amid
the
first
joys
of
human
love
was
bound
to
be
fanned
into
flame
once
more
had
they
remained
at
jonville
in
loving
solitude
he
marc
might
have
sufficed
for
geneviève
yearning
passion
but
at
maillebois
foreign
elements
had
intervened
between
them
that
terrible
simon
case
had
brought
about
the
first
snap
and
then
had
come
its
consequences
the
struggle
between
himself
and
the
congregations
and
the
liberating
mission
which
he
had
undertaken
besides
they
had
no
longer
remained
alone
a
stream
of
people
and
things
now
flowed
between
them
growing
ever
wider
and
wider
and
they
could
already
foresee
the
day
when
they
would
be
utter
strangers
one
to
the
other
at
present
geneviève
met
some
of
marc
bitterest
enemies
at
madame
duparque
the
young
man
learnt
at
last
that
the
terrible
grandmother
after
years
of
humble
solicitation
had
obtained
the
favour
of
being
included
among
father
crabot
penitents
the
rector
of
valmarie
usually
reserved
his
services
as
confessor
for
the
fine
ladies
of
beaumont
and
only
some
very
powerful
reasons
could
have
induced
him
to
confess
that
old
who
socially
was
of
no
account
whatever
and
not
only
did
he
receive
her
at
the
chapel
of
valmarie
but
he
did
her
the
honour
to
repair
to
the
place
des
capucins
whenever
an
attack
of
gout
confined
her
to
her
armchair
he
there
met
other
personages
of
the
cloth
abbé
quandieu
father
théodose
and
brother
fulgence
who
became
partial
to
that
pious
nook
all
shadows
and
silence
that
little
house
where
their
conclaves
it
seemed
might
pass
unperceived
nevertheless
rumours
circulated
some
people
saying
that
the
house
was
indeed
the
clerical
faction
secret
headquarters
the
hidden
laboratory
where
its
most
important
resolutions
were
prepared
yet
how
could
one
seriously
suspect
the
modest
dwelling
of
two
old
ladies
who
certainly
had
every
right
to
receive
their
friends
the
latter
shadows
were
scarcely
seen
pélagie
the
servant
swiftly
and
softly
closed
the
door
upon
them
not
a
face
ever
appeared
at
the
windows
not
a
murmur
filtered
through
the
sleepy
little
façade
everything
was
very
dignified
great
deference
was
shown
for
that
highly
respectable
dwelling
but
marc
regretted
that
he
had
not
gone
there
more
frequently
assuredly
he
had
made
a
great
mistake
in
abandoning
geneviève
to
the
two
old
ladies
allowing
her
to
spend
whole
days
in
their
company
with
little
louise
his
presence
would
have
counteracted
the
contagion
of
that
sphere
had
he
been
there
the
others
would
have
restrained
the
stealthy
attacks
which
as
he
well
realised
they
made
upon
his
ideas
and
his
person
geneviève
as
if
conscious
of
the
danger
with
which
the
peace
of
her
home
was
threatened
occasionally
offered
some
resistance
struggling
to
avoid
hostilities
with
the
husband
whom
she
still
loved
for
instance
on
returning
to
the
observances
of
the
church
she
had
chosen
abbé
quandieu
as
her
confessor
instead
of
father
théodose
whom
madame
duparque
had
sought
to
impose
on
her
the
young
woman
was
conscious
of
the
warlike
ardour
that
lurked
behind
the
capuchin
handsome
face
his
black
beard
and
his
glowing
eyes
which
filled
his
penitents
with
dreams
of
rapture
whereas
the
abbé
was
a
prudent
and
gentle
man
a
fatherly
confessor
whose
frequent
silence
was
full
of
sadness
one
too
in
whom
she
vaguely
divined
a
friend
one
who
suffered
from
the
fratricidal
warfare
of
the
times
and
longed
for
peace
among
all
workers
of
good
will
geneviève
indeed
was
yet
at
a
stage
of
loving
tenderness
when
her
mind
though
gradually
becoming
clouded
still
manifested
some
anxiety
before
it
finally
sank
into
mystical
passion
but
day
by
day
she
was
confronted
by
more
serious
assaults
and
yielded
more
and
more
to
the
disturbing
influence
of
her
relatives
whose
unctuous
gestures
and
caressing
words
slowly
benumbed
her
in
vain
did
marc
now
repair
more
frequently
to
the
place
des
capucins
he
could
no
longer
arrest
the
poison
deadly
work
as
yet
however
there
was
no
attempt
to
enforce
authority
no
brutal
roughness
geneviève
was
merely
enticed
flattered
cajoled
with
gentle
hands
and
no
violent
words
were
spoken
of
her
husband
on
the
contrary
he
was
said
to
be
a
man
deserving
of
all
pity
a
sinner
whose
salvation
was
most
desirable
the
unhappy
being
he
knew
not
what
incalculable
harm
he
was
doing
to
his
country
how
many
souls
he
was
wrecking
sending
to
hell
through
his
obstinate
rebellion
and
pride
then
at
first
vaguely
and
afterwards
more
and
more
plainly
a
desire
was
expressed
in
geneviève
presence
that
she
might
devote
herself
to
the
most
praiseworthy
task
of
converting
that
sinner
redeeming
that
guilty
man
whom
in
her
weakness
she
still
loved
what
joy
and
glory
would
be
hers
if
she
should
lead
him
back
to
religion
arrest
his
rageful
work
of
destruction
save
him
and
thereby
save
his
innocent
victims
from
eternal
damnation
for
several
months
with
infinite
craft
the
young
woman
was
in
this
wise
worked
upon
prepared
for
the
enterprise
expected
of
her
with
the
evident
hope
of
bringing
about
conjugal
rupture
by
fomenting
a
collision
between
the
two
irreconcilable
principles
which
she
and
her
husband
represented
she
a
woman
of
the
past
full
of
the
errors
of
the
ages
he
a
man
of
free
thought
marching
towards
the
future
and
in
time
the
inevitable
developments
appeared
the
conjugal
life
of
marc
and
geneviève
grew
sadder
every
day
that
life
so
gay
and
loving
once
when
their
kisses
had
perpetually
mingled
with
their
merry
laughter
they
had
not
yet
reached
the
quarrelling
stage
but
as
soon
as
they
found
themselves
alone
together
and
unoccupied
they
felt
embarrassed
something
of
which
they
never
spoke
seemed
to
be
growing
up
between
them
chilling
them
more
and
more
prompting
them
to
enmity
on
marc
side
there
was
a
growing
consciousness
that
she
who
was
bound
up
with
every
hour
of
his
life
she
whom
he
embraced
at
night
was
a
woman
foreign
to
him
one
whose
ideas
and
sentiments
he
reprobated
and
on
geneviève
side
there
was
a
similar
feeling
an
exasperating
conviction
that
she
was
regarded
as
an
ignorant
unreasonable
child
one
who
was
still
adored
but
with
a
love
laden
with
much
dolorous
compassion
thus
their
first
wounds
were
imminent
one
night
when
they
were
in
bed
encompassed
by
the
warm
darkness
while
marc
held
geneviève
in
a
mute
embrace
as
if
she
were
some
sulking
child
she
suddenly
burst
into
bitter
sobs
exclaiming
you
love
me
no
longer
longer
love
you
my
darling
he
replied
do
you
say
that
you
loved
me
you
would
not
leave
me
in
such
dreadful
sorrow
you
turn
away
from
me
more
and
more
each
day
you
treat
me
as
if
i
were
some
ailing
creature
sickly
or
insane
nothing
that
i
may
say
seems
of
any
account
to
you
you
shrug
your
shoulders
at
it
ah
i
feel
it
plainly
you
are
growing
more
and
more
impatient
i
am
becoming
a
worry
a
burden
to
you
though
marc
heart
contracted
he
did
not
interrupt
her
for
he
wished
to
learn
everything
she
resumed
for
me
i
can
see
things
quite
plainly
you
take
more
interest
in
the
last
of
your
boys
than
you
do
in
me
when
you
are
downstairs
with
the
boys
in
the
classroom
you
become
impassioned
you
pour
out
your
whole
soul
you
exert
yourself
to
explain
the
slightest
things
to
them
and
laugh
and
play
with
them
like
an
elder
brother
but
directly
you
come
upstairs
you
get
gloomy
again
you
can
think
of
nothing
to
say
to
me
you
look
ill
at
ease
like
a
man
who
worried
by
his
wife
and
tired
of
her
ah
god
god
how
unhappy
i
am
again
she
burst
into
sobs
then
marc
making
up
his
mind
gently
responded
dared
not
tell
you
the
cause
of
my
sadness
darling
but
if
i
suffer
it
is
precisely
because
i
find
in
you
all
that
you
reproach
me
with
you
are
never
with
me
now
you
spend
whole
days
elsewhere
and
when
you
come
home
you
bring
with
you
an
air
of
unreason
and
death
which
ravages
our
poor
home
it
is
you
who
no
longer
speak
to
me
your
mind
is
always
wandering
deep
in
some
dim
dream
even
while
you
are
sewing
or
serving
the
meals
or
attending
to
our
little
louise
it
is
you
who
treat
me
with
indulgent
pity
as
if
i
were
a
guilty
man
perhaps
one
unconscious
of
his
crime
and
it
is
you
who
will
soon
have
ceased
to
love
me
if
you
refuse
to
open
your
eyes
to
a
little
reasonable
truth
but
she
would
not
admit
it
she
interrupted
each
sentence
that
came
from
him
with
protests
full
of
vehemence
and
stupefaction
i
i
it
is
i
whom
you
accuse
i
tell
you
that
you
no
longer
love
me
and
you
dare
to
assert
that
i
am
losing
my
love
for
you
then
casting
aside
all
restraint
revealing
the
innermost
thoughts
that
haunted
her
day
by
day
she
continued
how
happy
are
the
women
whose
husbands
share
their
faith
i
see
some
in
church
who
are
always
accompanied
by
their
husbands
how
delightful
it
must
be
for
husband
and
wife
to
place
themselves
conjointly
in
the
hands
of
god
those
homes
are
blessed
they
indeed
have
but
one
soul
and
there
is
no
felicity
that
heaven
does
not
shower
on
them
marc
could
not
restrain
a
slight
laugh
at
once
very
gentle
and
distressful
now
my
poor
wife
he
said
think
of
trying
to
convert
me
harm
would
there
be
in
that
she
answered
eagerly
you
imagine
i
do
not
love
you
enough
to
feel
frightful
grief
at
the
thought
of
the
deadly
peril
you
are
in
you
do
not
believe
in
future
punishment
you
brave
the
wrath
of
heaven
but
for
my
part
i
pray
heaven
every
day
to
enlighten
you
and
i
would
give
ah
willingly
ten
years
of
my
life
to
be
able
to
open
your
eyes
and
save
you
from
the
terrible
catastrophes
which
threaten
you
ah
if
you
would
only
love
me
and
listen
to
me
and
follow
me
to
the
land
of
eternal
delight
she
trembled
in
his
embrace
she
glowed
with
such
a
fever
of
superhuman
desire
that
he
was
thunderstruck
for
he
had
not
imagined
the
evil
to
be
so
deep
it
was
she
who
catechised
him
now
who
tried
to
win
him
to
her
faith
and
he
felt
ashamed
for
was
she
not
doing
what
he
himself
ought
to
have
done
the
very
first
day
that
is
strive
to
convert
her
to
his
own
views
he
could
not
help
expressing
his
thoughts
aloud
and
unluckily
he
said
is
not
you
yourself
who
is
speaking
you
have
been
given
a
task
full
of
danger
for
the
happiness
of
both
of
us
at
this
she
began
to
lose
her
temper
do
you
wound
me
like
that
she
asked
you
think
i
am
incapable
of
acting
for
myself
from
personal
conviction
and
affection
am
i
senseless
then
so
stupid
and
docile
that
i
can
only
serve
as
an
instrument
besides
even
if
people
who
are
worthy
of
all
respect
and
whose
sacred
character
you
disregard
do
speak
to
me
about
you
in
a
brotherly
way
which
would
surprise
you
ought
you
not
rather
to
be
moved
by
it
ought
you
not
to
yield
to
such
god
who
might
strike
you
down
holds
out
his
arms
to
you
yet
when
he
makes
use
of
me
and
my
love
to
lead
you
back
to
him
you
can
only
jest
and
treat
me
as
if
i
were
a
foolish
little
girl
repeating
a
lesson
ah
we
understand
each
other
no
longer
and
it
is
that
which
grieves
me
so
much
while
she
spoke
he
felt
his
fear
and
desolation
increasing
is
true
he
repeated
slowly
no
longer
understand
one
another
words
no
longer
have
the
same
meaning
for
us
and
every
reproach
that
i
address
to
you
you
address
to
me
which
of
us
will
break
away
from
the
other
which
of
us
loves
the
other
and
works
for
the
happiness
ah
i
am
the
guilty
one
and
i
greatly
fear
that
it
is
too
late
for
me
to
repair
my
fault
i
ought
to
have
taught
you
where
to
find
truth
and
equity
at
these
words
so
suggestive
of
his
profession
her
rebellion
became
complete
for
you
i
am
always
a
foolish
pupil
who
knows
nothing
and
whose
eyes
require
to
be
opened
but
it
is
i
who
know
where
truth
and
justice
are
to
be
found
you
have
not
the
right
to
speak
those
words
the
right
you
have
plunged
into
that
monstrous
error
that
ignoble
simon
affair
in
which
your
hatred
of
the
church
blinds
you
and
urges
you
to
the
worst
iniquity
when
a
man
like
you
goes
so
far
as
to
override
all
truth
and
justice
in
order
to
strike
and
befoul
the
ministers
of
religion
it
is
better
to
believe
that
he
has
lost
his
senses
this
time
marc
reached
the
root
of
the
quarrel
which
geneviève
was
picking
with
him
the
simon
case
lay
beneath
everything
else
it
was
that
alone
which
had
inspired
all
the
discreet
and
skilful
manœuvring
of
which
he
beheld
the
effects
if
his
wife
were
enticed
away
from
him
at
her
relatives
home
if
she
were
employed
as
a
weapon
to
strike
him
a
deadly
blow
it
was
especially
in
order
that
an
artisan
of
truth
a
possible
justiciary
might
be
smitten
in
his
person
it
was
necessary
to
suppress
him
for
his
destruction
alone
could
ensure
the
impunity
of
the
real
culprits
his
voice
trembled
with
deep
grief
as
he
answered
geneviève
this
is
more
serious
there
will
be
an
end
to
our
home
if
we
can
no
longer
agree
on
so
clear
and
so
simple
a
question
are
you
no
longer
on
my
side
then
in
that
painful
affair
certainly
not
think
poor
simon
guilty
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
the
reasons
you
give
for
asserting
his
innocence
repose
on
no
foundation
whatever
i
should
like
you
to
hear
the
persons
whose
purity
of
life
you
dare
to
suspect
and
as
you
fall
into
such
gross
error
respecting
a
case
in
which
everything
is
so
evident
a
case
which
is
settled
beyond
possibility
of
appeal
how
can
i
place
the
slightest
faith
in
your
other
notions
your
fanciful
social
system
in
which
you
begin
by
suppressing
religion
he
had
taken
her
in
his
arms
again
and
was
holding
her
in
a
tight
embrace
ah
she
was
right
their
slowly
increasing
rupture
had
originated
in
their
divergence
of
views
on
that
question
of
truth
and
justice
in
reference
to
which
others
had
managed
to
poison
her
understanding
geneviève
he
said
is
only
one
truth
one
justice
you
must
listen
to
me
and
our
agreement
will
restore
our
peace
no
geneviève
you
must
not
remain
in
such
darkness
when
i
see
light
all
around
me
it
would
mean
separation
forever
no
let
me
be
you
tire
me
i
wo
even
listen
she
wrenched
herself
from
his
embrace
and
turned
her
back
upon
him
he
vainly
sought
to
clasp
her
again
kissing
her
and
whispering
gentle
words
she
would
not
move
she
would
not
even
answer
a
chill
swept
down
on
the
conjugal
couch
and
the
room
seemed
black
as
ink
dolorously
lifeless
as
if
the
misfortune
which
was
coming
had
already
annihilated
everything
from
that
time
forward
geneviève
became
more
nervous
and
much
less
consideration
was
now
shown
for
her
husband
at
her
grandmother
house
he
was
attacked
in
her
presence
in
an
artfully
graduated
manner
as
by
degrees
her
affection
for
him
was
seen
to
decline
little
by
little
he
became
a
public
malefactor
one
of
the
damned
a
slayer
of
the
god
she
worshipped
and
the
rebellion
to
which
she
was
thus
urged
in
her
home
in
bitter
words
in
an
increase
of
discomfort
and
coldness
fresh
quarrels
arose
at
intervals
usually
at
night
when
they
retired
to
rest
for
in
the
daytime
they
saw
little
of
each
other
marc
then
being
busy
with
his
boys
and
geneviève
being
constantly
absent
now
at
church
now
at
her
grandmother
thus
their
life
was
gradually
quite
spoilt
the
young
woman
showed
herself
more
and
more
aggressive
while
her
husband
so
tolerant
by
nature
in
his
turn
ended
by
manifesting
irritation
darling
i
shall
want
you
during
afternoon
lessons
he
said
one
evening
i
ca
come
she
replied
quandieu
will
be
expecting
me
besides
you
need
not
rely
on
me
for
anything
you
help
me
then
i
detest
everything
you
do
damn
yourself
if
you
choose
but
i
have
to
think
of
my
salvation
each
is
to
go
his
own
way
you
please
darling
darling
is
it
you
who
speak
like
that
are
they
going
to
change
your
heart
after
fogging
your
mind
so
now
you
are
altogether
on
the
side
of
the
corrupters
and
poisoners
quiet
be
quiet
you
unhappy
man
it
is
your
work
which
is
all
falsehood
and
poison
you
blaspheme
your
justice
and
your
truth
are
filthy
and
it
is
the
devil
yes
the
devil
who
teaches
those
wretched
children
of
yours
whom
i
no
longer
even
pity
for
they
must
be
stupid
indeed
to
remain
here
poor
darling
how
is
it
possible
that
you
once
so
intelligent
can
say
such
foolish
things
a
man
finds
women
foolish
he
leaves
them
to
themselves
thereupon
in
his
turn
losing
his
temper
marc
indeed
left
her
to
herself
making
no
effort
to
win
her
back
by
a
loving
caress
as
in
former
days
it
often
happened
that
they
were
unable
to
get
to
sleep
they
lay
in
bed
side
by
side
with
their
eyes
wide
open
in
the
darkness
silent
and
motionless
as
if
the
little
space
which
separated
them
had
become
an
abyss
marc
was
particularly
afflicted
by
the
growing
hatred
which
geneviève
manifested
against
his
school
against
the
dear
children
whom
he
so
passionately
strove
to
teach
at
each
fresh
dispute
she
expressed
herself
so
bitterly
that
it
seemed
as
if
she
became
jealous
of
the
little
ones
when
she
saw
him
treat
them
so
affectionately
endeavour
so
zealously
to
make
them
sensible
and
peaceable
at
bottom
indeed
geneviève
quarrel
with
marc
had
no
other
cause
for
she
herself
was
but
a
child
one
of
those
who
needed
to
be
taught
and
freed
but
who
rebelled
and
clung
stubbornly
to
the
errors
of
the
ages
and
in
her
estimation
all
the
affection
which
her
husband
lavished
on
his
boys
was
diverted
from
herself
as
long
as
he
should
busy
himself
with
them
in
such
a
fatherly
fashion
she
would
be
unable
to
conquer
him
carry
him
away
into
the
divine
and
rapturous
stultification
in
which
she
would
fain
have
seen
him
fall
asleep
in
her
arms
the
struggle
at
last
became
concentrated
on
that
one
point
geneviève
no
longer
passed
the
classroom
without
feeling
an
inclination
to
cross
herself
like
one
who
was
utterly
upset
by
the
diabolical
work
accomplished
there
who
was
irritated
by
her
powerlessness
to
wrest
from
such
impious
courses
the
man
whose
bed
she
still
shared
months
even
years
went
by
and
the
battle
between
marc
and
geneviève
grew
fiercer
but
no
imprudent
haste
was
displayed
at
the
home
of
her
relatives
for
the
church
has
all
eternity
before
her
to
achieve
her
ends
besides
leaving
on
one
side
that
vain
marplot
brother
fulgence
father
théodose
and
father
crabot
were
too
skilled
in
the
manipulation
of
souls
to
overlook
the
necessity
of
proceeding
slowly
with
a
woman
of
passionate
nature
whose
mind
was
an
upright
one
when
mysticism
did
not
obscure
and
pervert
it
as
long
as
she
should
love
her
husband
as
long
as
there
should
be
no
conjugal
rupture
the
work
they
had
undertaken
would
not
be
complete
and
it
required
a
long
time
to
uproot
and
extirpate
a
great
love
from
a
woman
heart
and
flesh
in
such
wise
that
it
might
never
grow
again
thus
geneviève
was
left
in
the
hands
of
abbé
quandieu
so
that
he
might
gently
rock
her
to
sleep
before
more
energetic
action
was
attempted
meantime
the
others
contented
themselves
with
watching
her
it
was
a
masterpiece
of
delicate
gradual
but
certain
spell
working
another
affair
helped
to
disturb
marc
home
he
took
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
madame
férou
who
had
installed
herself
with
her
three
daughters
in
a
wretched
lodging
at
maillebois
where
she
had
sought
work
as
a
seamstress
while
awaiting
a
summons
from
her
husband
the
dismissed
schoolmaster
who
had
fled
to
brussels
to
seek
employment
there
but
the
wretched
man
endeavours
had
proved
fruitless
he
had
found
himself
unable
even
to
provide
for
his
own
wants
and
tortured
by
separation
exasperated
by
exile
he
had
lost
his
head
and
returned
to
maillebois
with
the
bravado
of
one
whom
misery
pursues
and
who
can
know
no
worse
misfortune
than
that
already
befalling
him
denounced
on
the
very
next
day
he
was
seized
by
the
military
authorities
as
a
deserter
and
salvan
had
to
intervene
actively
to
save
him
from
being
incorporated
at
once
in
some
disciplinary
company
he
was
now
in
garrison
in
a
little
alpine
town
at
the
other
end
of
france
while
his
wife
and
daughters
scarcely
possessed
of
shelter
and
clothes
often
found
themselves
without
bread
marc
also
had
exerted
himself
on
férou
behalf
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
he
had
then
seen
him
for
a
few
minutes
and
was
unable
to
forget
him
that
poor
big
haggard
fellow
lingered
in
his
mind
like
the
victim
of
social
abomination
doubtless
he
had
made
his
retention
in
office
impossible
even
as
mauraisin
said
but
how
many
excuses
there
were
for
this
shepherd
son
who
had
become
a
schoolmaster
who
had
been
starved
for
years
who
had
been
treated
with
so
much
scorn
on
account
of
his
poverty
who
had
been
cast
to
the
most
extreme
views
by
his
circumstances
he
a
man
of
intelligence
and
learning
who
found
himself
possessing
nothing
knowing
not
one
joy
of
life
whereas
ignorant
brutes
possessed
and
enjoyed
all
around
him
and
the
long
iniquity
had
ended
in
brutal
far
away
from
those
who
were
dear
to
him
and
who
were
perishing
of
misery
it
not
enough
to
goad
one
into
turning
everything
upside
down
he
had
cried
to
marc
at
their
brief
interview
his
eyes
flashing
while
he
waved
his
long
bony
arms
signed
it
true
a
ten
engagement
which
exempted
me
from
if
i
gave
those
ten
years
to
teaching
and
it
true
also
that
i
gave
only
eight
years
as
i
was
revoked
for
having
said
what
i
thought
about
the
revolting
idolatry
but
was
it
i
who
cancelled
my
engagement
and
after
casting
me
brutally
adrift
without
any
means
of
subsistence
is
it
monstrous
to
seize
me
and
claim
payment
of
my
old
debt
to
the
army
in
such
wise
that
my
wife
and
children
must
remain
with
nobody
to
earn
a
living
for
them
the
eight
years
i
spent
in
the
university
penitentiary
where
a
man
who
believes
in
truth
is
allowed
neither
freedom
of
speech
nor
freedom
of
action
were
not
enough
for
them
they
insist
on
robbing
me
of
two
more
years
on
shutting
me
up
in
their
gaol
of
blood
and
iron
and
reducing
me
to
that
life
of
passive
obedience
which
is
the
necessary
apprenticeship
for
devastation
and
massacre
the
mere
thought
of
which
exasperates
me
ah
it
too
much
i
given
them
quite
enough
of
my
life
and
they
will
end
by
maddening
me
if
they
ask
me
for
more
alarmed
at
finding
him
so
excited
marc
tried
to
calm
him
by
promising
to
do
all
he
could
for
his
wife
and
daughters
in
two
years
time
he
would
be
released
and
then
some
position
might
be
found
for
him
and
he
would
be
able
to
begin
his
life
afresh
but
férou
remained
gloomy
and
growled
angry
words
no
i
done
for
i
shall
never
get
through
those
two
years
quietly
they
know
it
well
and
it
to
get
the
chance
of
killing
me
like
a
mad
dog
that
they
are
sending
me
yonder
then
he
inquired
who
had
replaced
him
at
le
moreux
and
on
hearing
that
it
was
a
man
named
chagnat
an
teacher
at
brévannes
a
large
parish
of
the
region
he
began
to
laugh
bitterly
chagnat
a
dusky
little
man
with
a
low
brow
and
retreating
mouth
and
chin
was
the
personification
of
the
perfect
beadle
not
a
hypocrite
like
jauffre
who
made
use
of
religion
as
a
means
to
advancement
but
a
bigot
such
a
dolt
indeed
as
to
believe
in
any
nonsensical
trash
that
fell
from
the
priest
lips
his
wife
a
huge
carroty
creature
was
yet
more
stupid
than
himself
and
férou
bitter
gaiety
increased
when
he
learnt
that
mayor
saleur
had
completely
abdicated
in
favour
of
that
idiot
chagnat
whom
abbé
cognasse
employed
as
a
kind
of
to
rule
the
parish
on
his
behalf
i
told
you
long
ago
said
férou
all
that
dirty
gang
the
priests
the
good
brothers
and
the
good
sisters
would
eat
us
up
and
reign
here
you
would
believe
me
you
declared
that
my
mind
was
diseased
well
now
it
has
come
to
pass
they
are
your
masters
and
you
see
into
what
a
fine
mess
they
will
lead
you
it
disgusts
one
to
be
a
man
a
stray
dog
is
less
to
be
pitied
and
as
for
myself
i
had
quite
enough
of
it
all
i
bring
things
to
an
end
if
they
plague
me
nevertheless
férou
was
sent
off
to
join
his
regiment
and
another
three
months
went
by
the
wretchedness
of
his
unhappy
wife
steadily
increasing
she
once
so
fair
and
pleasant
with
her
bright
and
fresh
round
face
now
looked
twice
as
old
as
she
really
was
aged
betimes
by
hard
toil
and
want
she
still
found
very
little
work
and
spent
an
entire
winter
month
fireless
almost
without
bread
to
make
matters
worse
her
eldest
daughter
fell
ill
with
typhoid
fever
and
lay
perishing
in
the
icy
garret
into
which
the
wind
swept
through
every
chink
in
the
door
and
window
marc
who
in
a
discreet
way
had
already
given
alms
to
the
poor
woman
at
last
begged
his
wife
to
entrust
her
with
some
work
although
geneviève
spoke
of
férou
even
as
those
whom
she
met
at
her
grandmother
house
spoke
of
him
saying
that
he
had
blasphemously
insulted
the
sacred
heart
and
was
a
sacrilegist
she
felt
stirred
by
the
story
of
his
wife
bitter
want
she
said
to
her
husband
needs
a
new
frock
i
have
the
stuff
and
i
will
take
it
to
that
woman
you
for
her
i
will
go
with
you
marc
replied
on
the
following
day
they
repaired
together
to
madame
férou
sordid
lodging
whence
her
landlord
threatened
to
expel
her
as
she
was
in
arrears
with
her
rent
her
eldest
daughter
was
now
near
her
death
and
when
the
froments
arrived
she
herself
and
her
two
younger
girls
were
sobbing
in
heartrending
fashion
amid
the
fearful
disorder
of
the
place
for
a
moment
marc
and
geneviève
remained
standing
there
amazed
and
unable
to
understand
the
situation
have
heard
it
you
have
heard
it
have
you
madame
férou
at
last
exclaimed
it
done
now
they
are
going
to
kill
him
ah
he
guessed
it
he
said
that
those
brigands
would
end
by
having
his
skin
she
went
on
speaking
in
a
disjointed
fashion
amid
her
sobs
and
marc
was
thus
able
to
extract
from
her
the
distressful
story
férou
as
was
inevitable
had
turned
out
a
very
bad
soldier
and
unfavourably
noted
by
his
superiors
treated
with
the
utmost
harshness
as
a
revolutionary
he
had
carried
a
quarrel
with
his
corporal
so
far
as
to
rush
on
the
latter
and
kick
and
pommel
him
for
this
he
had
been
and
they
were
now
about
to
send
him
to
a
military
in
algeria
where
he
would
be
drafted
into
one
of
those
disciplinary
companies
among
which
the
abominable
tortures
of
the
old
ages
are
still
practised
will
never
come
back
they
will
murder
him
his
wife
continued
in
a
fury
wrote
to
bid
me
he
knows
that
he
will
soon
be
killed
and
what
shall
i
do
what
will
become
of
my
poor
children
ah
the
brigands
the
brigands
marc
listened
sorely
grieved
unable
to
think
of
a
word
of
consolation
whereas
geneviève
began
to
show
signs
of
impatience
my
dear
madame
férou
she
exclaimed
should
they
kill
your
husband
the
officers
of
our
army
are
not
in
the
habit
of
killing
their
men
you
increase
your
own
distress
by
your
unjust
thoughts
are
brigands
i
tell
you
the
unhappy
woman
repeated
with
growing
violence
my
poor
férou
starved
for
eight
years
discharging
the
most
ungrateful
duties
and
he
is
taken
for
another
two
years
and
treated
like
a
brute
beast
simply
because
he
spoke
like
a
sensible
man
and
now
what
was
bound
to
happen
has
happened
he
is
sent
to
the
galleys
where
they
end
by
murdering
him
after
dragging
him
from
agony
to
agony
no
no
i
wo
have
it
i
go
and
tell
them
that
they
are
all
a
band
of
brigands
brigands
marc
endeavoured
to
calm
her
he
all
kindliness
and
equity
was
shocked
by
such
excessive
social
iniquity
but
what
could
those
on
whom
it
recoiled
the
wife
and
children
do
crushed
as
they
were
beneath
the
millstone
of
tragic
fate
reasonable
said
he
will
try
to
do
something
we
will
not
forsake
you
but
geneviève
had
become
icy
cold
that
wretched
home
where
the
mother
was
wringing
her
hands
where
the
poor
puny
girls
were
sobbing
and
lamenting
no
longer
inspired
her
with
any
pity
she
no
longer
even
saw
the
eldest
daughter
wrapped
in
the
shreds
of
a
blanket
and
looking
so
ghastly
as
she
gazed
at
the
scene
with
dilated
expressionless
eyes
unable
even
to
weep
such
was
her
weakness
erect
and
rigid
still
carrying
the
little
parcel
formed
of
the
stuff
for
louise
new
frock
the
young
woman
slowly
said
must
place
yourself
in
the
hands
of
god
cease
to
offend
him
for
he
might
punish
you
still
more
a
laugh
of
terrible
scorn
came
from
madame
férou
god
is
too
busy
with
the
rich
to
pay
attention
to
the
poor
she
cried
was
in
his
name
that
we
were
reduced
to
this
misery
it
is
in
his
name
that
they
are
going
to
murder
my
poor
husband
at
this
geneviève
was
carried
away
by
anger
blaspheme
you
deserve
no
help
said
she
you
had
only
shown
a
little
religious
feeling
i
know
persons
who
would
have
helped
you
already
i
ask
you
for
nothing
madame
the
poor
woman
answered
i
know
that
help
has
been
refused
me
because
i
do
not
go
to
confession
even
abbé
quandieu
who
is
so
charitable
does
not
dare
to
include
me
among
his
poor
but
i
am
not
a
hypocrite
i
simply
endeavour
to
earn
my
bread
by
work
then
apply
for
work
to
the
wretched
madmen
who
regard
the
priests
and
the
officers
as
brigands
and
thereupon
geneviève
hurried
away
in
a
passion
carrying
with
her
the
stuff
for
her
daughter
frock
marc
was
obliged
to
follow
her
though
he
quivered
with
indignation
and
halfway
down
the
stairs
he
could
restrain
himself
no
longer
have
just
done
a
bad
action
he
exclaimed
a
god
of
kindness
would
be
charitable
to
all
your
god
of
wrath
and
punishment
is
but
a
monstrous
phantasy
it
is
not
necessary
that
one
should
humble
oneself
to
deserve
assistance
it
is
sufficient
that
one
should
suffer
no
those
who
sin
deserve
their
sufferings
let
them
suffer
if
they
persist
in
impiety
my
duty
is
to
do
nothing
for
them
that
same
evening
when
they
were
alone
the
quarrel
began
afresh
and
marc
on
his
side
for
the
first
time
became
violent
unable
as
he
was
to
forgive
geneviève
lack
of
charity
hitherto
he
had
fancied
that
her
mind
alone
was
threatened
but
was
it
not
evident
now
that
her
heart
also
would
be
spoilt
and
that
night
irreparable
words
were
spoken
husband
and
wife
realised
what
an
abyss
had
been
dug
between
them
by
invisible
hands
then
both
relapsed
into
silence
in
the
black
room
full
of
grief
and
pain
and
on
the
morrow
they
did
not
exchange
a
word
moreover
a
source
of
constant
disputes
one
which
was
bound
to
make
rupture
inevitable
had
now
sprung
up
louise
would
be
soon
ten
years
old
and
the
question
of
sending
her
to
abbé
quandieu
catechism
classes
in
order
that
she
might
be
prepared
for
her
first
communion
presented
itself
marc
after
begging
mademoiselle
rouzaire
to
exempt
his
daughter
from
all
religious
exercises
had
noticed
that
the
schoolmistress
took
no
account
of
his
request
but
crammed
the
child
with
orisons
and
canticles
as
she
did
with
her
other
pupils
but
he
was
obliged
to
close
his
eyes
to
it
for
he
realised
that
the
schoolmistress
was
only
too
anxious
to
have
a
chance
of
appealing
to
geneviève
on
the
subject
in
order
to
create
trouble
in
his
home
when
the
catechism
question
arose
however
he
desired
to
act
firmly
and
watched
for
an
opportunity
to
have
a
decisive
explanation
with
geneviève
that
opportunity
presented
itself
naturally
enough
on
the
day
when
louise
returning
from
her
lessons
said
to
her
mother
in
her
father
presence
mademoiselle
rouzaire
told
me
to
ask
you
to
see
abbé
quandieu
so
that
he
may
put
my
name
down
for
his
catechism
class
right
my
dear
i
will
go
to
see
him
marc
who
was
reading
quickly
raised
his
head
me
my
dear
but
you
will
not
go
to
abbé
quandieu
not
is
simple
enough
i
do
not
wish
louise
to
follow
the
catechism
lessons
because
i
do
not
wish
her
to
make
her
first
communion
geneviève
did
not
immediately
lose
her
temper
but
laughed
as
if
with
ironical
compassion
are
out
of
your
senses
my
friend
said
she
make
her
first
communion
indeed
why
in
that
case
how
would
you
find
a
husband
for
her
what
a
casteless
shameless
position
you
would
give
her
throughout
her
life
besides
you
allowed
her
to
be
baptised
you
allowed
her
to
learn
her
bible
history
and
prayers
so
it
is
illogical
on
your
part
to
forbid
the
catechism
and
the
communion
marc
also
kept
his
temper
for
the
moment
and
answered
quietly
are
right
i
was
weak
and
for
that
very
reason
i
am
resolved
to
be
weak
no
longer
i
showed
all
tolerance
for
your
belief
as
long
as
the
child
remained
quite
young
and
hung
about
your
skirts
a
daughter
it
is
said
ought
to
belong
more
particularly
to
her
mother
and
i
am
willing
that
it
should
be
so
until
the
time
comes
when
the
question
of
the
girl
moral
life
her
whole
future
presents
itself
surely
the
father
then
has
a
right
to
intervene
geneviève
waved
her
hand
impatiently
and
her
voice
began
to
tremble
as
she
answered
wish
louise
to
follow
the
catechism
lessons
you
do
wish
her
to
do
so
if
we
have
equal
rights
over
the
child
we
may
go
on
disputing
for
ever
without
reaching
a
solution
what
i
desire
seems
to
you
idiotic
and
what
you
desire
appears
to
me
abominable
what
i
desire
what
i
desire
my
desire
simply
is
that
my
daughter
shall
not
be
prevented
from
exercising
her
own
free
will
later
on
the
question
now
is
to
profit
by
her
childishness
in
order
to
deform
her
mind
and
heart
poison
her
with
lies
and
render
her
for
ever
incapable
of
becoming
human
and
sensible
and
that
is
what
i
desire
to
prevent
but
i
do
not
wish
to
impose
my
will
on
her
i
simply
wish
to
ensure
her
the
free
exercise
of
her
will
at
a
later
date
how
do
you
provide
for
that
what
is
to
be
done
with
this
big
girl
is
only
necessary
to
let
her
grow
up
and
to
open
her
eyes
to
every
truth
when
she
is
twenty
she
will
decide
who
is
right
you
or
i
and
if
she
should
then
think
it
sensible
and
logical
she
will
revert
to
the
catechism
and
make
her
first
communion
at
this
geneviève
exploded
are
really
mad
you
say
such
absurd
things
before
the
child
that
i
feel
ashamed
of
you
marc
also
lost
patience
my
poor
wife
it
is
your
notions
that
are
absurd
and
i
wo
have
my
child
mind
perverted
with
such
absurdities
quiet
be
quiet
she
cried
do
know
what
you
wrench
from
me
when
you
speak
like
that
yes
you
tear
away
all
my
love
for
you
all
our
happiness
which
i
should
still
like
to
save
but
how
are
we
to
agree
if
words
no
longer
have
the
same
meaning
for
us
if
what
you
declare
to
be
absurd
is
for
me
the
divine
and
the
eternal
and
is
not
your
fine
logic
at
fault
how
can
louise
choose
between
your
ideas
and
mine
if
you
now
prevent
me
from
having
her
instructed
as
i
desire
i
do
not
prevent
you
from
telling
her
whatever
you
wish
but
i
must
be
free
to
take
her
to
the
catechism
class
marc
was
already
weakening
know
the
theory
said
he
child
enlightened
by
both
the
father
and
the
mother
with
the
right
of
choosing
between
their
views
later
on
but
is
that
right
left
intact
when
a
full
course
of
religious
training
aggravating
the
child
long
catholic
heredity
deprives
her
of
all
power
of
thinking
and
acting
freely
the
father
who
is
so
imperfectly
armed
can
do
little
when
he
talks
truth
and
sense
to
a
girl
whose
senses
and
whose
heart
are
disturbed
by
others
and
when
she
has
grown
up
amid
the
pomps
of
the
church
its
terrifying
mysteries
and
its
mystical
absurdities
it
is
too
late
for
her
to
revert
to
a
little
sense
her
mind
has
been
warped
for
ever
you
have
your
right
as
a
father
geneviève
retorted
violently
have
my
right
as
a
mother
you
are
not
going
to
take
my
daughter
from
me
when
she
is
only
ten
years
old
and
still
has
so
much
need
of
me
it
would
be
monstrous
i
am
an
honest
woman
and
i
mean
to
make
louise
an
honest
woman
too
she
shall
go
to
the
catechism
class
and
if
necessary
i
myself
will
take
her
marc
who
had
risen
from
his
chair
made
a
furious
gesture
of
protest
but
he
had
strength
enough
to
restrain
the
violent
the
supreme
words
which
would
have
precipitated
immediate
rupture
what
could
he
say
what
could
he
do
as
usual
he
recoiled
from
the
fearful
prospect
of
seeing
his
home
destroyed
his
happiness
changed
into
hourly
torture
he
still
loved
that
woman
who
showed
herself
so
and
particularly
so
stubborn
there
still
lingered
on
his
lips
the
taste
of
hers
and
he
could
not
forget
he
could
not
obliterate
the
happy
days
of
their
early
married
life
the
powerful
bond
then
formed
between
them
that
child
who
was
the
flesh
of
their
flesh
and
now
the
cause
of
their
quarrels
like
many
others
before
him
he
felt
he
was
driven
into
a
corner
whence
he
could
not
extricate
himself
unless
he
took
to
brutal
courses
tore
the
child
from
her
mother
arms
and
plunged
the
house
into
desolation
and
commotion
every
day
and
there
was
too
much
gentleness
too
much
kindness
in
his
nature
he
lacked
the
cold
energy
that
was
requisite
for
a
struggle
in
which
his
own
heart
and
the
hearts
of
those
he
loved
must
bleed
on
that
field
then
he
was
foredoomed
to
defeat
louise
had
listened
in
silence
without
moving
to
the
dispute
between
her
father
and
mother
for
some
time
past
whenever
she
had
seen
them
thus
at
variance
her
large
brown
eyes
had
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
with
an
expression
of
sad
and
increasing
surprise
papa
she
now
said
amid
the
painful
silence
which
had
fallen
do
you
wish
me
to
go
to
the
catechism
class
she
was
very
tall
for
her
age
and
had
a
calm
and
gentle
face
in
which
the
features
of
the
duparques
and
the
froments
were
blended
though
she
was
still
only
a
child
she
displayed
keen
intelligence
and
a
thirst
for
information
which
constantly
impelled
her
to
ply
her
father
with
questions
and
she
worshipped
him
and
showed
also
great
affection
for
her
mother
who
attended
to
all
her
wants
with
a
kind
of
loving
passion
you
think
papa
she
resumed
if
things
which
are
not
reasonable
are
told
me
at
the
catechism
class
i
shall
accept
them
marc
in
spite
of
his
emotion
could
not
help
smiling
or
not
said
he
must
of
necessity
accept
them
you
will
explain
them
to
me
my
dear
they
are
and
must
remain
unexplainable
you
explain
to
me
everything
i
ask
you
when
i
come
back
from
mademoiselle
rouzaire
and
have
understood
some
lesson
it
is
thanks
to
you
that
i
am
often
the
first
of
my
class
you
came
back
from
abbé
quandieu
there
would
be
nothing
for
me
to
explain
to
you
marc
answered
the
essential
characteristic
of
the
pretended
truths
of
the
catechism
is
that
they
are
not
accessible
to
our
reason
how
funny
for
a
moment
louise
remained
silent
in
meditation
her
glance
wandering
far
away
then
still
with
a
pensive
expression
on
her
face
she
slowly
gave
utterance
to
her
thoughts
funny
when
things
have
been
explained
to
me
and
i
do
understand
them
i
recollect
nothing
about
them
it
is
as
if
they
did
exist
i
close
my
eyes
and
see
nothing
everything
is
black
and
then
however
much
i
may
try
the
last
of
the
class
she
looked
charming
with
her
serious
little
face
well
balanced
as
she
already
was
going
instinctively
towards
all
that
was
good
clear
and
sensible
whenever
an
attempt
was
made
to
force
into
her
head
things
whose
sense
escaped
her
or
which
seemed
to
her
to
be
wrong
she
smiled
in
a
quiet
way
and
passed
them
by
but
geneviève
now
intervened
saying
with
some
irritation
your
father
can
not
explain
the
catechism
to
you
i
will
do
so
at
this
louise
immediately
ran
to
kiss
her
mother
as
if
she
feared
she
had
offended
her
it
mamma
you
will
hear
me
my
lessons
you
know
that
i
always
try
my
best
to
understand
and
turning
towards
her
father
she
gaily
resumed
see
papa
you
may
as
well
let
me
go
to
the
catechism
particularly
as
you
say
yourself
that
one
ought
to
learn
everything
so
that
one
may
be
the
better
able
to
judge
and
choose
then
once
again
marc
gave
way
having
neither
the
strength
nor
the
means
to
act
otherwise
he
reproached
himself
with
his
weakness
but
such
was
his
craving
for
affection
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
be
otherwise
than
weak
when
he
thought
of
his
devastated
home
where
the
struggle
each
day
became
more
painful
the
rupture
was
soon
to
be
precipitated
however
by
a
final
incident
years
had
elapsed
since
marc
arrival
at
maillebois
and
there
had
been
all
sorts
of
changes
among
his
pupils
sébastien
milhomme
his
favourite
now
fifteen
years
of
age
was
by
his
advice
preparing
himself
for
admission
into
the
training
college
of
beaumont
having
secured
his
elementary
certificate
already
in
his
twelfth
year
four
other
boys
had
left
the
school
with
similar
certificates
the
two
doloirs
and
the
twin
savins
auguste
doloir
had
now
embraced
his
father
calling
as
a
mason
while
his
brother
charles
had
been
apprenticed
to
a
locksmith
as
for
savin
he
had
declined
to
follow
marc
advice
and
make
schoolmasters
of
his
sons
for
he
did
not
wish
to
see
them
starve
said
he
in
an
ungrateful
calling
which
everybody
held
in
contempt
so
he
had
proudly
placed
achille
with
a
and
was
looking
about
him
for
some
petty
employment
which
would
suit
philippe
meantime
the
fernand
bongard
had
quietly
returned
to
his
father
farm
to
till
the
ground
having
failed
to
gain
a
certificate
though
in
marc
hands
he
had
acquired
more
understanding
than
his
parents
possessed
as
for
the
girls
who
had
quitted
mademoiselle
rouzaire
angèle
bongard
who
was
more
intelligent
than
her
brother
had
duly
carried
a
certificate
to
the
farm
where
like
the
shrewd
ambitious
young
person
she
was
quite
capable
of
keeping
accounts
she
dreamt
of
improving
her
position
then
hortense
savin
still
without
a
certificate
at
sixteen
years
of
age
had
become
a
very
pretty
brunette
extremely
devout
and
sly
she
had
remained
a
handmaiden
of
the
virgin
and
her
father
dreamt
of
a
fine
marriage
for
her
though
there
were
rumours
of
a
mysterious
seduction
the
consequences
of
which
she
each
day
found
it
more
difficult
to
hide
of
course
several
new
boys
had
come
to
marc
school
replacing
their
elders
there
there
was
another
little
savin
jules
whom
marc
remembered
having
seen
as
an
infant
at
the
time
of
the
simon
case
and
there
was
another
little
doloir
léon
born
subsequent
to
the
affair
and
now
nearly
seven
years
old
later
on
the
children
children
would
be
coming
to
the
school
and
if
marc
were
left
at
his
post
perhaps
he
would
teach
them
also
thus
facilitating
another
step
to
humanity
ever
on
the
march
towards
increase
of
knowledge
but
marc
was
particularly
concerned
about
one
of
his
new
boys
one
whom
he
had
greatly
desired
to
have
at
the
school
this
was
little
joseph
simon
son
who
had
now
almost
completed
his
eleventh
year
for
a
long
time
marc
had
not
dared
to
expose
him
to
the
taunts
and
blows
of
the
other
boys
then
thinking
that
their
passions
had
calmed
down
sufficiently
he
had
made
the
venture
applying
to
madame
simon
and
the
lehmanns
and
promising
them
that
he
would
keep
a
good
watch
over
the
lad
for
three
years
now
he
had
had
joseph
in
the
school
and
after
defending
him
against
all
sorts
of
vexations
had
prevailed
on
the
other
boys
to
treat
him
with
some
good
fellowship
indeed
he
even
made
use
of
the
lad
as
a
living
example
when
seeking
to
inculcate
principles
of
tolerance
dignity
and
kindness
joseph
was
a
very
handsome
boy
in
whom
his
mother
beauty
was
blended
with
his
father
intelligence
and
the
dreadful
story
of
his
father
fate
with
which
it
had
been
necessary
to
acquaint
him
seemed
to
have
ripened
him
before
his
time
usually
grave
and
reserved
he
studied
with
a
sombre
ardour
intent
on
being
always
the
first
of
his
class
as
if
by
that
triumph
to
raise
himself
above
all
outrage
his
dream
his
express
desire
which
marc
encouraged
was
to
become
a
schoolmaster
for
in
this
he
boyishly
pictured
a
kind
of
and
rehabilitation
no
doubt
it
was
joseph
fervour
the
passionate
gravity
of
that
clever
and
handsome
boy
which
the
more
particularly
struck
little
louise
whose
senior
he
was
by
nearly
three
years
at
all
events
she
became
his
great
friend
and
they
were
well
pleased
whenever
they
found
themselves
together
at
times
marc
kept
joseph
after
lessons
and
at
times
also
his
sister
sarah
came
to
fetch
him
then
if
sébastien
milhomme
as
was
sometimes
the
case
happened
to
be
at
marc
a
delightful
hour
was
spent
the
four
children
agreed
so
well
that
they
never
quarrelled
sarah
whom
her
mother
feared
to
confide
to
others
as
she
did
her
boy
was
at
ten
years
of
age
a
most
charming
child
gentle
and
loving
and
sébastien
five
years
her
elder
treated
her
with
the
playful
affection
of
an
elder
brother
geneviève
alone
manifested
violent
displeasure
when
the
four
children
happened
to
meet
in
her
rooms
she
found
in
this
another
cause
for
anger
with
her
husband
why
had
he
brought
those
jews
into
their
home
there
was
no
need
for
her
daughter
to
compromise
herself
by
associating
with
the
children
of
that
horrid
criminal
who
had
been
sent
to
the
galleys
thus
this
also
helped
to
bring
about
quarrels
in
the
home
at
last
came
the
fated
catastrophe
one
evening
when
the
four
young
people
were
playing
together
after
lessons
sébastien
suddenly
felt
ill
he
staggered
as
if
intoxicated
and
marc
had
to
take
him
to
his
mother
on
the
morrow
the
boy
was
unable
to
leave
his
bed
a
terrible
attack
of
typhoid
fever
prostrated
him
and
for
three
weeks
his
life
hung
in
the
balance
it
was
a
frightful
time
for
his
mother
madame
alexandre
who
remained
at
his
bedside
no
longer
setting
foot
in
the
shop
downstairs
moreover
since
the
simon
affair
she
had
gradually
withdrawn
from
it
leaving
her
madame
edouard
to
conduct
the
business
in
accordance
with
their
joint
interests
as
a
matter
of
fact
madame
edouard
who
was
the
man
in
their
partnership
was
designated
for
the
directorship
by
the
triumph
of
the
clerical
party
the
custom
of
the
secular
school
was
sufficiently
insured
by
the
presence
of
madame
alexandre
behind
her
and
for
her
own
part
she
intended
to
increase
her
business
among
the
devotees
of
the
town
with
the
help
of
her
son
victor
who
had
lately
left
the
brothers
school
he
was
now
a
big
youth
of
seventeen
with
a
large
head
a
harsh
face
and
fierce
eyes
he
had
failed
to
secure
an
elementary
certificate
having
always
shown
himself
an
execrable
pupil
and
he
now
dreamt
of
enlisting
and
becoming
a
general
as
in
the
old
days
when
he
had
played
at
war
with
his
cousin
sébastien
taken
him
prisoner
and
pommelled
him
passionately
meantime
as
he
was
not
old
enough
for
soldiering
he
lived
in
idleness
making
his
escape
from
the
shop
as
often
as
possible
for
he
hated
having
to
stand
behind
a
counter
and
sell
paper
and
pens
and
roaming
through
maillebois
in
the
company
of
his
old
schoolfellow
polydor
the
son
of
souquet
the
and
the
nephew
of
pélagie
madame
duparque
servant
polydor
a
pale
and
artful
youth
whose
taste
for
idleness
was
extraordinary
desired
to
become
an
ignorantine
by
way
of
flattering
the
inclinations
of
his
aunt
from
whom
he
thereby
extracted
little
presents
moreover
by
embracing
this
religious
calling
he
would
not
have
to
break
stones
on
the
roads
as
his
father
did
and
in
particular
he
would
escape
the
thought
of
which
quite
horrified
him
though
in
other
respects
victor
and
polydor
had
different
tastes
they
were
in
full
agreement
as
to
the
delight
of
roaming
about
from
morn
till
night
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
to
say
nothing
of
their
goings
on
with
the
little
hussies
of
the
factory
quarter
of
the
town
whom
they
met
in
the
fields
near
the
verpille
in
this
wise
victor
being
always
out
and
about
and
madame
alexandre
remaining
beside
her
son
madame
edouard
since
sébastien
had
fallen
so
seriously
ill
found
herself
quite
without
assistance
in
the
shop
where
she
busied
herself
with
her
customers
and
gaily
counted
up
her
takings
which
were
often
large
marc
went
every
evening
to
ascertain
the
condition
of
his
pupil
and
thus
he
became
a
daily
spectator
of
a
heartrending
drama
the
bitter
grief
of
a
mother
who
saw
death
taking
her
son
a
little
further
from
her
every
hour
that
gentle
fair
madame
alexandre
who
had
loved
her
husband
passionately
had
been
leading
a
cloistered
life
as
it
were
ever
since
his
death
all
her
restrained
passion
going
to
that
son
of
hers
who
was
fair
and
gentle
like
herself
fondled
almost
spoilt
by
that
loving
mother
sébastien
regarded
her
with
a
kind
of
filial
idolatry
as
if
she
were
a
divine
mother
whom
he
could
never
requite
for
all
her
delightful
gifts
they
were
united
by
a
strong
a
powerful
bond
of
tender
affection
one
of
those
infinite
affections
in
which
two
beings
mingle
and
blend
to
such
a
point
that
neither
can
quit
the
other
without
wrenching
away
his
or
her
heart
when
marc
reached
the
little
dark
close
room
over
the
stationery
shop
he
often
found
madame
alexandre
forcing
back
her
tears
and
striving
to
smile
at
her
son
who
lay
there
already
emaciated
and
burning
with
fever
sébastien
are
you
better
the
master
would
ask
no
monsieur
froment
i
no
better
at
all
no
better
at
all
he
could
scarcely
speak
his
voice
was
faint
his
breath
came
short
but
the
shuddering
mother
exclaimed
gaily
listen
to
him
monsieur
froment
he
is
much
better
we
shall
pull
him
through
it
when
however
she
had
escorted
the
schoolmaster
to
the
landing
and
stood
there
with
him
after
closing
the
door
of
the
room
she
broke
down
god
he
is
lost
my
poor
child
is
lost
is
it
not
abominable
so
strong
and
handsome
as
he
was
his
poor
face
is
reduced
to
nothing
he
has
only
his
eyes
left
ah
god
god
i
feel
i
shall
die
with
him
but
she
stifled
her
cries
roughly
wiped
away
her
tears
and
put
on
her
smile
once
more
before
returning
to
the
chamber
of
suffering
where
she
spent
hours
and
hours
without
sleep
without
help
ever
fighting
against
death
one
evening
marc
found
her
sobbing
on
her
knees
beside
the
bed
her
face
close
pressed
to
the
sheets
her
son
could
no
longer
hear
or
see
her
since
the
previous
night
he
had
been
overpowered
by
his
malady
seized
with
delirium
and
now
that
he
had
neither
ears
to
hear
her
nor
eyes
to
see
her
she
abandoned
herself
to
her
frightful
grief
and
cried
it
aloud
child
my
child
what
have
i
done
that
my
child
should
be
stolen
from
me
so
good
a
son
who
was
all
my
heart
as
i
was
his
what
can
i
have
done
then
what
can
i
have
done
she
rose
and
grasping
marc
hands
pressed
them
wildly
me
monsieur
you
who
are
just
said
she
it
not
impossible
to
suffer
so
much
to
be
stricken
like
this
if
one
be
free
from
all
blame
it
would
be
monstrous
to
be
punished
when
one
has
done
no
wrong
is
it
not
so
this
then
can
only
be
an
expiation
and
if
that
were
true
ah
if
i
knew
if
i
knew
it
were
so
she
seemed
a
prey
to
some
horrible
struggle
for
some
days
past
anguish
had
been
making
her
restless
yet
she
did
not
speak
out
that
evening
it
was
only
on
the
morrow
that
on
marc
arrival
she
hastened
towards
him
as
if
carried
away
by
an
eager
desire
to
have
it
all
over
in
the
bed
near
her
lay
sébastien
scarce
able
to
breathe
monsieur
froment
said
she
must
confess
myself
to
you
the
doctor
has
just
left
my
son
is
dying
only
a
prodigy
can
save
him
and
now
my
fault
stifles
me
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
i
who
am
killing
my
son
i
who
am
punished
by
his
death
for
having
made
him
speak
falsely
long
ago
and
for
having
clung
so
stubbornly
to
that
falsehood
later
on
in
order
to
have
peace
and
quietness
in
my
home
when
another
an
innocent
man
was
suffering
the
worst
torture
ah
for
many
many
days
the
struggle
has
been
going
on
within
me
lacerating
my
heart
marc
listened
amazed
not
daring
as
yet
to
give
a
meaning
to
her
words
remember
monsieur
froment
she
resumed
remember
that
unhappy
man
simon
the
schoolmaster
who
was
condemned
for
the
murder
of
little
zéphirin
for
more
than
eight
years
he
has
been
in
penal
servitude
and
you
have
often
told
me
of
all
he
suffered
yonder
horrible
things
which
made
me
feel
quite
ill
i
should
have
liked
to
speak
out
yes
i
swear
it
i
was
often
on
the
point
of
relieving
my
conscience
for
remorse
haunted
me
so
dreadfully
but
cowardice
came
over
me
i
thought
of
my
son
peace
of
all
the
worries
i
should
cause
him
ah
how
stupid
how
foolish
i
was
i
remained
silent
for
the
sake
of
his
happiness
and
now
death
is
taking
him
from
me
taking
him
it
certain
because
i
wrongly
remained
silent
she
paused
gesticulating
wildly
as
if
justice
the
eternal
were
falling
on
her
like
a
thunderbolt
so
monsieur
froment
i
must
relieve
my
mind
perhaps
there
is
still
time
perhaps
justice
will
take
pity
on
me
if
i
repair
my
fault
you
remember
the
writing
slip
and
the
search
which
was
made
for
another
copy
of
it
on
the
day
after
the
crime
sébastien
told
you
that
he
had
seen
one
in
the
hands
of
his
cousin
victor
who
had
brought
it
from
the
brothers
school
and
that
was
true
but
that
same
day
we
were
frightened
to
such
a
point
that
my
compelled
my
son
to
tell
a
falsehood
by
saying
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
a
long
while
afterwards
i
found
that
slip
forgotten
in
an
old
copybook
which
victor
had
given
to
sébastien
and
later
sébastien
who
felt
worried
by
his
falsehood
acknowledged
it
to
you
when
he
came
home
and
told
me
of
his
confession
i
was
filled
with
alarm
and
in
my
turn
i
lied
first
of
all
to
him
saying
in
order
to
quiet
his
scruples
that
the
paper
no
longer
existed
as
i
had
destroyed
it
and
that
assuredly
is
the
for
which
i
am
punished
the
paper
still
exists
i
never
dared
to
burn
it
some
remaining
honesty
restrained
me
and
here
here
it
is
monsieur
froment
rid
me
of
it
rid
me
of
that
abominable
paper
for
it
is
that
which
has
brought
misfortune
and
death
into
the
house
she
hastened
to
a
wardrobe
and
from
under
a
pile
of
linen
she
drew
victor
old
copybook
in
which
the
writing
slip
had
been
slumbering
for
eight
years
past
marc
looked
at
it
thunderstruck
at
last
there
was
the
document
which
he
had
believed
to
be
destroyed
there
was
the
fact
which
he
had
sought
so
long
the
slip
he
held
appeared
to
be
in
all
respects
similar
to
the
one
which
had
figured
at
the
trial
there
were
the
words
vous
les
uns
les
there
was
the
illegible
paraph
recalling
the
one
which
the
experts
had
pretended
to
identify
with
simon
initials
and
it
was
difficult
to
contend
that
the
slip
had
not
come
from
the
brothers
school
for
victor
himself
had
copied
it
in
his
book
a
whole
page
of
which
was
filled
with
the
words
inscribed
on
it
but
all
at
once
marc
was
dazed
there
in
the
corner
of
the
slip
the
corner
missing
in
the
copy
which
had
been
used
in
evidence
at
the
trial
was
an
imprint
quite
plain
and
quite
intact
of
the
stamp
with
which
the
brothers
stamped
everything
belonging
to
their
school
a
sudden
light
was
thus
shed
on
the
affair
somebody
had
torn
away
the
corner
of
the
copy
found
in
zéphirin
room
in
order
to
annihilate
the
stamp
and
put
justice
off
the
scent
quivering
with
excitement
carried
away
by
gratitude
and
sympathy
marc
grasped
the
poor
mother
hands
madame
he
exclaimed
have
done
a
great
and
worthy
action
and
may
death
take
pity
and
restore
your
son
to
you
at
that
moment
they
perceived
that
sébastien
who
had
given
no
sign
of
consciousness
since
the
previous
evening
had
just
opened
his
eyes
and
was
looking
at
them
they
felt
profoundly
stirred
the
ailing
lad
evidently
recognised
marc
but
he
was
not
yet
free
from
delirium
beautiful
sunshine
monsieur
froment
he
stammered
in
a
faint
voice
get
up
and
you
take
me
with
you
i
help
you
to
give
lessons
his
mother
ran
to
him
and
kissed
him
wildly
haste
to
get
well
make
haste
to
get
well
my
boy
neither
of
us
must
ever
more
tell
a
falsehood
we
must
be
always
good
and
just
as
marc
quitted
the
room
he
found
that
madame
edouard
hearing
a
noise
had
come
upstairs
the
door
having
remained
open
she
had
witnessed
the
whole
scene
and
had
seen
him
place
her
son
old
copybook
and
the
slip
in
the
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
she
followed
him
down
the
stairs
in
silence
but
when
they
reached
the
shop
she
stopped
him
saying
am
in
despair
monsieur
froment
you
must
not
judge
us
severely
we
are
only
two
poor
lone
women
and
find
it
difficult
indeed
to
earn
a
little
competence
for
our
old
age
i
do
ask
you
to
give
me
that
paper
back
you
are
going
to
make
use
of
it
and
i
can
not
oppose
you
i
understand
it
fully
only
this
is
a
real
catastrophe
for
us
and
again
do
not
think
me
a
bad
woman
if
i
try
to
save
our
little
business
indeed
she
was
not
a
bad
woman
it
merely
happened
that
she
had
no
faith
no
passion
apart
from
the
prosperity
of
that
humble
stationery
business
she
had
already
reflected
that
if
the
secular
school
should
gain
the
day
it
would
merely
be
necessary
for
her
to
retire
into
the
background
and
allow
madame
alexandre
to
direct
the
shop
nevertheless
this
was
hardly
a
pleasant
prospect
given
her
business
instincts
and
her
fondness
for
domineering
over
others
so
she
strove
to
lighten
the
catastrophe
as
far
as
possible
might
content
yourself
with
utilising
the
slip
without
producing
my
son
copybook
said
she
it
has
just
occurred
to
me
that
you
might
arrange
a
story
and
say
for
instance
that
i
happened
to
find
the
slip
and
gave
it
to
you
that
would
show
us
in
a
suitable
and
we
could
then
openly
pass
over
to
your
side
with
the
certainty
that
you
would
be
victorious
in
spite
of
his
emotion
marc
could
not
refrain
from
smiling
is
i
think
madame
easiest
and
most
honourable
to
tell
the
truth
said
he
will
nevertheless
remain
praiseworthy
at
this
she
seemed
to
feel
somewhat
reassured
she
replied
think
so
of
course
i
ask
nothing
better
than
that
the
truth
should
become
known
if
we
do
not
have
to
suffer
from
it
marc
had
complaisantly
taken
the
copybook
and
the
slip
from
his
pocket
in
order
to
show
her
exactly
what
he
was
carrying
away
and
she
was
telling
him
that
she
fully
recognised
both
book
and
slip
when
all
at
once
her
son
victor
came
in
from
some
escapade
accompanied
by
his
friend
polydor
souquet
while
twisting
about
and
laughing
over
some
prank
known
to
themselves
alone
the
two
young
fellows
glanced
at
the
and
polydor
at
once
expressed
the
liveliest
surprise
he
exclaimed
paper
but
when
marc
quickly
raised
his
head
struck
as
he
was
by
that
exclamation
and
divining
that
a
little
more
of
the
truth
lurked
behind
it
the
youth
reassumed
his
usual
sleepy
hypocritical
expression
and
tried
to
recall
his
words
paper
do
you
know
it
then
marc
asked
him
no
i
said
the
paper
because
because
it
is
a
paper
marc
could
draw
nothing
further
from
him
as
for
victor
he
continued
to
sneer
as
if
he
were
amused
to
find
that
old
affair
cropping
up
once
more
ah
yes
the
which
he
had
brought
home
from
school
one
day
long
ago
and
which
that
little
fool
sébastien
had
made
such
a
fuss
about
but
madame
edouard
still
felt
ashamed
and
when
marc
withdrew
she
accompanied
him
outside
to
beg
him
to
do
all
he
could
to
spare
them
worry
she
had
just
thought
of
general
jarousse
their
cousin
who
would
certainly
not
be
pleased
if
the
affair
were
revived
he
had
formerly
done
them
the
great
honour
to
call
on
them
and
explain
that
when
one
country
might
suffer
from
the
truth
being
made
known
it
was
infinitely
preferable
and
far
more
glorious
to
tell
a
lie
and
if
general
jarousse
should
be
angered
whatever
would
she
do
with
her
son
victor
who
relied
on
his
relative
protection
to
become
a
general
in
his
turn
that
evening
marc
was
to
dine
at
madame
duparque
whither
he
still
repaired
at
times
as
he
was
unwilling
that
geneviève
should
always
go
alone
polydor
exclamation
still
haunted
him
for
he
felt
that
the
truth
lurked
behind
it
and
it
so
happened
that
when
he
reached
the
ladies
house
with
geneviève
and
louise
he
caught
sight
of
the
young
fellow
whispering
eagerly
to
his
aunt
pélagie
in
the
kitchen
moreover
the
ladies
greeting
was
so
frigid
that
marc
divined
in
it
some
threat
during
the
last
few
years
madame
berthereau
geneviève
mother
had
been
declining
visibly
ever
in
an
ailing
state
full
also
of
a
kind
of
despairing
sadness
amid
her
resignation
but
madame
duparque
the
grandmother
though
she
was
now
remained
combative
terrible
implacable
in
her
faith
in
order
that
marc
might
fully
understand
for
what
exceptional
reasons
she
thought
it
right
to
receive
him
she
never
invited
anybody
else
when
he
dined
at
her
house
by
this
course
she
hoped
also
to
make
him
understand
that
his
position
was
that
of
a
pariah
and
that
it
was
impossible
to
ask
honest
folk
to
meet
him
that
evening
then
as
on
previous
occasions
silence
and
embarrassment
reigned
during
the
meal
and
by
the
hostile
demeanour
of
the
others
and
particularly
by
the
brusqueness
of
pélagie
who
served
at
table
marc
became
fully
convinced
that
some
storm
was
about
to
burst
on
him
until
the
dessert
was
served
however
madame
duparque
restrained
herself
like
a
intent
on
playing
her
part
as
mistress
of
the
house
correctly
at
last
when
pélagie
came
in
with
some
apples
and
pears
she
said
to
her
may
keep
your
nephew
to
dinner
i
give
you
permission
the
old
servant
in
her
scolding
aggressive
voice
replied
the
poor
boy
needs
to
recruit
himself
after
the
violence
that
was
done
him
this
afternoon
at
this
marc
suddenly
understood
everything
the
ladies
had
been
made
acquainted
with
his
discovery
of
the
by
polydor
who
for
some
reason
which
remained
obscure
had
hastened
to
tell
everything
to
his
aunt
oh
said
marc
who
could
not
help
laughing
was
it
that
wanted
to
do
violence
to
polydor
was
it
i
by
chance
when
the
dear
boy
ventured
to
bamboozle
me
so
pleasantly
by
feigning
stupidity
at
mesdames
milhommes
this
afternoon
madame
duparque
however
would
not
allow
such
a
serious
matter
to
be
treated
in
that
ironical
fashion
she
proceeded
to
unbosom
herself
without
any
show
of
anger
but
in
that
rigid
cutting
manner
of
hers
which
suffered
no
reply
was
it
possible
that
the
husband
of
her
dear
geneviève
still
thought
of
reviving
the
abominable
affair
of
that
man
simon
that
vile
assassin
who
had
been
so
justly
condemned
who
deserved
no
pity
whatever
and
who
ought
indeed
to
have
been
guillotined
true
there
was
a
monstrous
legend
of
his
innocence
which
folk
hoped
to
make
use
of
in
order
to
shake
religion
and
hand
france
over
to
the
jews
and
now
after
obstinately
searching
among
all
that
filth
marc
pretended
that
he
had
found
the
proof
the
famous
new
fact
which
had
been
announced
so
many
times
already
a
fine
proof
indeed
a
strip
of
paper
which
had
come
nobody
knew
whence
nor
how
the
invention
of
a
pack
of
children
who
either
lied
or
were
mistaken
marc
quietly
answered
was
agreed
that
we
should
not
speak
of
those
matters
any
more
i
have
not
ventured
to
make
the
slightest
allusion
to
them
it
is
you
who
begin
again
but
what
good
can
a
dispute
do
my
conviction
is
absolute
you
know
the
real
culprit
and
you
intend
to
denounce
him
to
justice
asked
the
old
lady
quite
beside
herself
at
this
pélagie
who
was
beginning
to
clear
away
could
not
restrain
herself
any
case
it
is
brother
gorgias
i
can
answer
for
that
she
suddenly
cried
marc
enlightened
by
these
words
turned
towards
her
do
you
say
that
he
asked
on
the
evening
of
the
crime
brother
gorgias
accompanied
my
nephew
polydor
to
his
father
on
the
road
to
jonville
and
got
back
to
the
school
before
eleven
polydor
and
other
witnesses
testified
to
that
at
the
trial
marc
was
still
gazing
fixedly
at
the
old
woman
but
his
mind
was
busy
at
work
that
which
he
had
long
suspected
was
becoming
a
moral
certainty
he
could
picture
the
brother
accompanying
polydor
then
returning
homeward
pausing
before
zéphirin
open
window
and
talking
to
the
boy
at
last
he
climbed
over
the
low
window
bar
the
better
perhaps
to
see
the
pictures
which
the
lad
had
set
out
on
his
table
then
however
came
the
horrid
impulse
abominable
madness
and
the
child
strangled
the
murderer
fled
by
the
window
which
he
still
left
wide
open
it
was
from
his
own
pocket
that
he
had
taken
that
copy
of
petit
to
use
it
as
a
gag
never
noticing
in
his
perturbation
that
the
was
with
the
newspaper
and
on
the
morrow
when
the
crime
was
discovered
it
was
father
philibin
who
finding
himself
unable
to
destroy
the
slip
as
mignot
had
seen
it
had
been
obliged
to
content
himself
with
tearing
away
the
corner
on
which
the
stamp
was
impressed
thus
at
all
events
removing
all
positive
proof
of
the
place
whence
the
slip
had
come
slowly
and
gravely
marc
answered
pélagie
gorgias
is
the
culprit
everything
proves
it
and
i
swear
it
is
so
indignant
protests
arose
around
the
table
madame
duparque
was
stifling
with
indignation
madame
berthereau
whose
mournful
eyes
went
from
her
daughter
to
her
whose
rupture
she
sorely
dreaded
made
a
gesture
of
supreme
despair
and
while
little
louise
who
paid
great
attention
to
her
father
words
remained
there
quietly
never
stirring
geneviève
sprang
to
her
feet
and
quitted
the
table
saying
would
do
better
to
hold
your
tongue
it
will
soon
be
quite
impossible
for
me
to
remain
near
you
you
will
end
by
making
me
hate
you
later
that
same
evening
when
louise
had
gone
to
sleep
and
the
husband
and
the
wife
also
lay
in
bed
there
came
a
moment
of
profound
silence
in
their
dark
room
since
dinner
neither
had
spoken
to
the
other
but
marc
was
always
the
first
to
try
to
make
friends
for
he
could
not
bear
the
suffering
which
their
quarrels
brought
him
now
however
when
he
gently
sought
to
embrace
geneviève
she
nervously
pushed
him
away
quivering
as
if
with
repulsion
let
me
be
hurt
by
her
manner
he
did
not
insist
and
the
silence
fell
heavily
again
at
last
she
resumed
is
one
thing
i
have
not
yet
told
you
i
believe
that
i
am
at
this
full
of
happy
emotion
her
husband
drew
near
to
her
again
anxious
to
press
her
to
his
heart
my
dear
dear
wife
what
good
news
now
we
shall
indeed
belong
to
each
other
once
more
but
she
freed
herself
from
his
clasp
with
even
more
impatience
than
before
as
if
his
presence
near
her
brought
her
real
suffering
no
let
me
be
she
repeated
am
not
well
i
be
able
to
sleep
it
fidgets
me
to
feel
you
stirring
near
me
it
will
be
better
to
have
two
beds
if
things
go
on
like
this
not
another
word
passed
between
them
they
lapsed
into
silence
speaking
neither
of
the
simon
affair
nor
of
the
tidings
which
geneviève
had
so
abruptly
announced
only
the
sound
of
their
heavy
breathing
was
to
be
heard
in
the
dark
and
lifeless
room
neither
was
asleep
but
neither
could
penetrate
the
other
anxious
painful
thoughts
it
was
as
if
they
inhabited
two
different
worlds
parted
by
a
distance
of
many
thousand
leagues
and
vague
sobs
seemed
to
come
from
far
away
from
the
very
depths
of
the
black
and
dolorous
night
bewailing
the
death
of
their
love
iv
after
a
few
days
reflection
marc
made
up
his
mind
and
requested
david
to
meet
him
one
evening
at
the
lehmanns
in
the
rue
du
trou
for
nearly
ten
years
the
lehmanns
had
been
living
in
their
dim
and
damp
little
house
amid
public
execration
when
as
sometimes
happened
bands
of
clericals
and
came
down
and
threatened
the
shop
they
hastily
put
up
the
shutters
and
continued
working
by
the
smoky
light
of
two
lamps
all
their
maillebois
customers
even
their
having
forsaken
them
they
were
dependent
on
the
they
did
for
paris
clothiers
dealing
in
goods
and
that
hard
and
work
kept
old
lehmann
and
his
mournful
wife
bent
on
their
board
for
fourteen
hours
a
day
and
yielded
scarcely
enough
money
to
provide
food
for
themselves
rachel
and
her
children
all
of
whom
were
huddled
there
in
dismal
distress
without
a
joy
or
a
hope
in
life
even
now
after
so
many
years
passing
pedestrians
spat
on
their
doorstep
to
show
how
fully
they
loathed
and
hated
that
filthy
den
whither
so
the
legend
ran
simon
the
murderer
had
brought
zéphirin
blood
while
it
was
still
warm
to
use
it
in
some
vile
deed
of
witchcraft
and
nowadays
to
that
abode
of
intense
wretchedness
and
deep
cloistered
grief
came
simon
letters
briefer
and
more
infrequent
than
formerly
yet
still
and
ever
telling
the
tale
of
the
innocent
man
long
agony
those
letters
alone
had
the
power
of
stirring
rachel
into
life
of
drawing
her
from
the
torpor
and
resignation
in
which
she
spent
most
of
her
days
her
once
beautiful
countenance
was
now
but
a
ruin
ravaged
by
her
tears
she
lived
only
for
her
children
sarah
whom
she
still
kept
beside
her
fearing
to
expose
her
to
the
insults
of
the
malicious
and
joseph
whom
marc
defended
at
the
school
the
dreadful
story
of
their
father
fate
had
long
been
hidden
from
them
but
it
had
been
necessary
to
tell
them
the
truth
at
last
partly
in
order
to
spare
them
much
painful
doubt
and
cogitation
nowadays
whenever
a
letter
arrived
from
the
penal
settlement
yonder
it
was
read
in
their
presence
and
those
bitter
trials
inculcated
virility
of
nature
in
them
and
helped
to
ripen
their
budding
minds
after
each
perusal
their
mother
took
them
in
her
arms
repeating
that
nowhere
under
the
skies
was
there
a
more
honest
a
more
noble
a
man
than
their
father
she
swore
to
them
that
he
was
innocent
she
told
them
of
the
awful
martyrdom
he
endured
she
prophesied
to
them
that
he
would
some
day
be
freed
rehabilitated
and
acclaimed
and
she
asked
them
to
love
and
revere
him
when
that
day
should
dawn
to
encompass
him
with
a
worship
whose
sweetness
might
enable
him
to
forget
his
many
years
of
torture
and
yet
would
the
unhappy
man
live
until
that
day
of
truth
and
justice
it
was
a
miracle
that
he
had
not
succumbed
already
among
the
brutes
who
crucified
him
to
survive
he
had
needed
an
extraordinary
amount
of
moral
energy
the
frigid
power
of
resistance
the
logical
temperament
with
which
nature
had
fortunately
endowed
him
still
his
last
letters
gave
cause
for
increasing
anxiety
he
was
evidently
at
the
end
of
his
strength
quite
overcome
and
rachel
fears
reached
such
a
point
that
without
pausing
to
consult
anybody
she
usually
so
languid
repaired
one
morning
to
la
désirade
to
see
baron
nathan
who
was
then
staying
there
with
the
sanglebœufs
she
took
with
her
the
last
letter
she
had
received
from
her
husband
in
order
to
show
it
to
the
baron
meaning
to
beg
him
triumphant
jew
that
he
was
one
of
the
of
the
world
to
exert
his
great
influence
in
order
to
obtain
a
little
pity
for
the
poor
wretched
crucified
jew
who
was
suffering
yonder
and
she
came
home
in
tears
shuddering
as
if
she
had
just
left
some
dazzling
and
fearsome
place
she
could
hardly
remember
what
had
happened
the
baron
the
bloated
renegade
had
received
her
with
a
stern
countenance
as
if
angered
by
her
audacity
perhaps
it
was
his
daughter
a
frigid
lady
whom
she
had
found
with
him
she
could
not
tell
exactly
how
they
had
got
rid
of
her
but
it
was
with
words
of
refusal
such
as
might
have
been
addressed
to
a
beggar
then
she
had
found
herself
outside
again
by
the
wealth
accumulated
at
that
splendid
abode
of
la
désirade
with
its
sumptuous
its
running
waters
and
its
white
statues
and
since
that
fruitless
attempt
she
had
relapsed
into
the
mournful
waiting
attitude
of
former
days
ever
garbed
in
black
like
a
living
statue
of
mutely
protesting
grief
in
the
midst
of
persecution
the
only
person
on
whom
marc
relied
in
that
home
of
wretchedness
and
suffering
was
david
whose
mind
was
so
clear
whose
heart
was
so
upright
and
so
firm
ever
since
the
condemnation
of
simon
marc
had
seen
him
striving
evincing
neither
impatience
nor
weakness
nor
despair
despite
all
the
difficulties
of
his
task
indeed
faith
remained
entire
he
was
convinced
of
his
brother
innocence
and
felt
certain
that
he
would
some
day
prove
it
he
had
understood
at
the
outset
that
he
would
need
some
money
to
achieve
his
task
and
he
had
arranged
his
life
accordingly
he
outwardly
resumed
the
direction
of
the
sand
and
gravel
pits
which
he
had
leased
from
baron
nathan
in
such
wise
that
everybody
believed
that
he
conducted
the
business
personally
but
in
reality
the
chief
responsibility
fell
upon
his
foreman
who
was
devoted
to
him
and
the
profits
being
handled
prudently
sufficed
for
david
other
work
his
real
mission
the
investigations
which
he
carried
on
so
discreetly
some
people
who
believed
him
to
be
a
miser
accused
him
of
earning
large
sums
of
money
and
yet
giving
no
help
to
his
who
shared
the
wretched
home
of
the
lehmanns
where
incessant
toil
led
only
to
a
life
of
privations
at
one
moment
also
an
attempt
was
made
to
dispossess
david
of
his
sand
and
gravel
pits
the
sanglebœufs
threatening
him
with
an
which
was
evidently
prompted
by
father
crabot
the
jesuit
indeed
was
conscious
of
the
stealthy
underhand
efforts
which
that
silent
but
active
man
was
making
and
would
have
liked
to
drive
him
from
the
district
or
at
least
to
cripple
his
resources
but
david
fortunately
held
a
thirty
years
lease
from
baron
nathan
and
thus
he
was
still
able
to
carry
on
the
business
which
ensured
him
the
money
he
needed
his
principal
efforts
had
been
long
concentrated
on
the
illegal
communication
which
president
gragnon
was
said
to
have
made
to
the
jurors
in
their
retiring
room
when
the
proceedings
in
simon
trial
were
over
after
interminable
inquiries
david
had
collected
enough
information
to
picture
the
scene
in
its
broad
lines
the
jurors
assailed
by
certain
scruples
had
sent
for
the
presiding
judge
in
order
to
question
him
about
the
penalties
their
verdict
might
entail
and
the
judge
in
order
to
silence
their
scruples
had
shown
them
an
old
letter
of
simon
which
had
been
placed
in
his
hands
a
moment
previously
this
letter
an
insignificant
note
to
a
friend
acquired
importance
from
the
fact
that
it
was
followed
by
a
postscript
signed
with
a
paraph
identical
with
the
one
which
figured
on
the
incriminating
this
singular
document
produced
at
the
last
moment
without
the
knowledge
of
the
prisoner
or
his
counsel
had
assuredly
led
to
the
verdict
of
but
how
was
david
to
establish
all
this
how
could
he
induce
one
of
the
jurors
to
testify
to
the
facts
the
revelation
of
which
would
have
brought
about
an
immediate
revision
of
the
proceedings
particularly
if
as
david
felt
convinced
the
postscriptum
of
the
letter
and
its
initialling
were
forgeries
he
had
long
endeavoured
to
act
through
others
on
the
foreman
of
the
jury
architect
jacquin
a
devout
and
very
upright
catholic
and
he
believed
that
he
had
lately
disturbed
that
man
conscience
by
acquainting
him
with
the
illegality
of
the
judge
communication
under
the
circumstances
if
in
addition
he
could
prove
that
the
postscriptum
and
the
paraph
had
been
forged
jacquin
would
speak
out
when
marc
repaired
to
the
rue
du
trou
to
keep
the
appointment
he
had
made
with
david
he
found
the
little
shop
shut
the
house
quite
dark
and
lifeless
the
family
had
prudently
taken
refuge
in
the
back
parlour
where
lehmann
and
his
wife
were
working
by
lamplight
and
it
was
there
that
the
stirring
scene
took
place
in
the
presence
of
the
quivering
rachel
and
her
children
whose
eyes
were
all
ablaze
before
speaking
out
however
marc
wished
to
ascertain
what
point
david
had
now
reached
in
his
investigations
things
are
moving
but
still
very
very
slowly
the
other
answered
is
one
of
those
christians
who
worship
a
deity
of
love
and
equity
at
one
moment
i
felt
alarmed
for
i
discovered
that
father
crabot
was
bringing
the
greatest
pressure
to
bear
on
him
through
every
possible
intermediary
but
i
am
now
easy
on
that
point
jacquin
will
act
only
as
his
conscience
may
direct
the
difficulty
is
to
get
at
the
document
in
order
that
it
may
be
examined
by
experts
did
not
gragnon
destroy
it
marc
inquired
seems
not
having
shown
it
to
the
jurors
he
did
not
dare
to
do
so
but
simply
placed
it
with
the
papers
in
the
case
among
which
it
must
still
be
at
least
such
is
the
conviction
of
delbos
based
on
certain
information
he
has
obtained
thus
the
question
is
to
exhume
it
from
among
the
records
and
it
is
not
easy
to
devise
a
plausible
motive
for
doing
so
nevertheless
we
are
making
progress
and
after
a
pause
david
added
you
my
friend
have
you
any
good
news
good
and
great
news
then
marc
slowly
recounted
all
that
had
happened
sébastien
illness
madame
alexandre
despair
followed
by
her
remorse
and
terror
which
had
prompted
her
to
hand
him
the
duplicate
of
the
on
which
duplicate
one
found
both
the
stamp
of
the
school
and
a
paraph
which
undoubtedly
represented
brother
initials
it
is
said
marc
you
see
is
the
stamp
in
the
very
corner
which
was
torn
away
from
the
copy
found
near
little
zéphirin
body
we
fancied
that
it
might
have
been
bitten
off
by
the
victim
but
father
philibin
at
least
had
time
to
tear
it
off
on
that
point
the
recollections
of
mignot
my
assistant
are
precise
now
look
at
the
paraph
it
is
identical
with
the
other
which
figured
at
the
trial
but
it
is
more
legible
and
one
can
fully
distinguish
brother
gorgias
initials
that
is
an
f
and
a
g
interlaced
which
the
experts
masters
badoche
and
trabut
with
extraordinary
aberration
persisted
in
declaring
to
be
an
l
and
an
s
otherwise
your
initials
my
conviction
is
now
absolute
the
culprit
is
brother
gorgias
and
none
other
footnote
brother
gorgias
frère
gorgias
with
passionate
eagerness
they
all
stared
at
the
narrow
yellow
strip
of
paper
produced
by
marc
and
scrutinised
it
in
the
pale
lamplight
the
old
lehmanns
quitted
their
sewing
and
thrust
their
faces
forward
as
if
reviving
to
life
rachel
had
emerged
from
her
torpor
and
stood
there
quivering
while
the
two
children
joseph
and
sarah
their
eyes
aflame
pushed
one
another
in
order
that
they
might
see
the
better
finally
david
amid
the
deep
silence
of
that
mourning
home
took
the
paper
from
marc
and
examined
it
yes
he
said
conviction
is
the
same
as
yours
what
was
suspected
has
now
become
certain
brother
gorgias
is
the
guilty
man
a
long
discussion
followed
all
the
facts
were
recalled
in
succession
and
united
in
one
sheaf
they
threw
light
on
each
other
and
all
tended
to
the
same
conclusion
apart
from
the
material
proofs
which
were
beginning
to
come
in
there
was
a
moral
certainty
the
demonstration
as
it
were
of
a
mathematical
problem
which
reasoning
sufficed
to
solve
no
doubt
obscurity
still
hung
around
a
few
points
such
as
the
presence
of
the
in
the
brother
pocket
and
the
fate
of
the
corner
on
which
the
stamp
had
been
impressed
but
all
the
rest
seemed
certain
gorgias
returning
home
on
the
night
of
the
crime
chance
bringing
him
before
zéphirin
open
and
lighted
window
temptation
and
afterwards
murder
then
on
the
morrow
chance
likewise
bringing
father
philibin
and
brother
fulgence
on
the
scene
in
such
wise
that
they
became
mixed
up
in
the
tragedy
and
were
forced
to
act
in
order
to
save
one
of
their
fellows
and
how
plainly
did
the
mutilation
of
the
designate
the
culprit
whose
name
was
virtually
proclaimed
also
by
the
fierce
campaign
which
had
ensued
the
great
efforts
which
the
church
had
made
in
order
to
shield
him
and
cause
an
innocent
man
to
be
sentenced
in
his
stead
moreover
each
day
now
brought
fresh
light
and
before
long
the
whole
huge
edifice
of
falsehood
would
crumble
that
is
the
end
of
our
wretchedness
exclaimed
old
lehmann
becoming
quite
gay
will
only
be
necessary
to
show
that
paper
and
simon
will
be
restored
to
us
the
two
children
were
already
dancing
with
delight
repeating
in
blissful
accents
papa
will
come
back
papa
will
come
back
but
david
and
marc
remained
grave
they
knew
how
difficult
and
dangerous
the
situation
still
was
questions
of
the
greatest
weight
and
gravity
had
to
be
settled
how
were
they
to
make
use
of
that
document
what
course
was
to
be
followed
in
applying
for
a
revision
of
the
trial
thus
marc
answered
softly
must
think
it
over
one
must
wait
a
little
longer
at
this
rachel
relapsing
into
tears
stammered
amid
her
sobs
wait
for
what
for
the
poor
man
to
die
yonder
amid
the
torture
of
which
he
complains
once
more
the
dark
little
house
sank
into
mourning
all
felt
that
their
unhappiness
was
not
yet
over
after
their
keen
momentary
delight
came
frightful
anxiety
as
to
what
the
morrow
might
bring
forth
alone
can
guide
us
said
david
by
way
of
conclusion
you
are
willing
marc
we
will
go
to
see
him
on
thursday
so
call
for
me
on
thursday
in
ten
years
advocate
delbos
had
risen
to
a
remarkable
position
at
maillebois
the
simon
affair
that
compromising
case
the
brief
in
which
had
been
prudently
declined
by
all
his
colleagues
and
bravely
accepted
by
himself
had
decided
his
future
at
that
time
he
had
been
merely
a
peasant
son
imbued
with
some
democratic
instincts
and
gifted
with
eloquence
but
while
studying
the
affair
and
gradually
becoming
the
impassioned
defender
of
the
truth
he
had
found
himself
in
presence
of
all
the
forces
coalescing
in
favour
of
falsehood
and
the
maintenance
of
every
social
iniquity
and
this
had
ended
by
making
him
a
militant
socialist
one
who
felt
convinced
that
the
salvation
of
the
country
could
come
solely
from
the
masses
by
degrees
the
whole
revolutionary
party
of
the
town
had
grouped
itself
around
him
and
at
the
last
elections
he
had
forced
a
second
ballot
on
the
radical
lemarrois
who
had
been
deputy
for
twenty
years
and
if
delbos
still
suffered
in
his
immediate
interests
from
the
circumstance
that
he
had
defended
a
jew
charged
with
every
crime
he
was
gradually
rising
to
a
lofty
position
by
the
firmness
of
his
faith
and
the
quiet
valour
of
his
actions
going
forward
to
victory
with
gay
and
virile
confidence
as
soon
as
marc
had
shown
him
the
obtained
from
madame
alexandre
the
advocate
raised
a
loud
cry
of
delight
last
we
hold
them
and
turning
towards
david
he
added
gives
us
a
second
new
fact
the
first
is
the
letter
a
forgery
no
doubt
which
was
illegally
communicated
to
the
jury
we
must
try
to
find
it
among
the
papers
of
the
case
and
the
second
is
this
bearing
the
stamp
of
the
brothers
school
and
a
paraph
which
is
evidently
that
of
brother
gorgias
it
will
i
think
be
easier
and
more
effective
to
use
this
second
proof
what
do
you
advise
me
to
do
asked
david
idea
is
to
write
a
letter
to
the
minister
of
justice
on
behalf
of
my
a
letter
formally
denouncing
brother
gorgias
as
the
perpetrator
of
the
crime
and
applying
for
the
revision
of
my
brother
case
delbos
had
become
thoughtful
again
would
undoubtedly
be
the
correct
course
said
he
it
is
a
delicate
matter
and
we
must
not
act
too
hastily
let
us
return
for
a
moment
to
the
illegal
communication
of
that
letter
which
it
will
be
so
difficult
for
us
to
prove
as
long
as
we
can
not
induce
architect
jacquin
to
relieve
his
conscience
you
remember
father
philibin
evidence
his
vague
allusion
to
a
paper
signed
by
your
brother
with
a
flourish
similar
to
that
on
the
incriminating
a
paper
about
which
he
would
give
no
precise
information
being
bound
said
he
by
confessional
secrecy
well
i
am
convinced
that
he
was
then
alluding
to
the
very
letter
which
was
placed
in
judge
gragnon
hands
at
the
last
moment
for
which
reason
like
you
i
suspect
it
to
be
forged
but
these
are
only
suppositions
theories
and
we
need
proofs
now
if
we
drop
that
matter
and
for
the
time
at
all
events
content
ourselves
with
this
duplicate
copy
of
the
writing
slip
on
which
the
school
stamp
appears
and
on
which
the
initialling
is
much
plainer
we
still
find
ourselves
face
to
face
with
some
puzzling
obscure
points
without
lingering
too
much
over
the
question
how
it
happened
that
such
a
slip
was
in
the
brother
pocket
at
the
moment
of
the
crime
a
point
which
it
is
rather
difficult
to
explain
i
am
very
worried
by
the
disappearance
of
the
corner
on
which
the
school
stamp
must
have
been
impressed
and
i
should
like
to
find
that
corner
before
acting
for
i
can
foresee
all
sorts
of
objections
which
will
be
raised
in
opposition
to
us
in
order
to
throw
the
affair
into
a
muddle
marc
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
find
that
corner
it
would
be
a
wonderful
chance
if
we
should
do
so
we
even
admitted
that
it
might
have
been
torn
away
by
the
victim
teeth
that
is
not
credible
delbos
answered
in
that
case
the
fragment
would
have
been
found
on
the
floor
nothing
was
found
so
the
corner
was
intentionally
torn
off
besides
we
here
detect
the
intervention
of
father
philibin
for
as
you
have
told
me
your
assistant
mignot
remembers
that
at
his
first
glance
the
appeared
to
him
to
be
intact
and
that
he
felt
surprised
when
after
losing
sight
of
it
for
a
moment
he
saw
it
still
in
father
hands
and
mutilated
so
there
is
no
doubt
on
the
point
the
corner
was
torn
away
by
father
philibin
throughout
the
campaign
it
was
he
always
he
who
turned
up
at
decisive
moments
to
save
the
culprit
and
this
is
why
i
should
like
to
have
complete
proof
that
is
to
say
the
little
fragment
of
paper
which
he
carried
away
with
him
at
this
david
in
his
turn
expressed
his
surprise
think
that
he
kept
it
i
think
so
at
all
events
he
may
have
kept
it
philibin
is
a
taciturn
man
extremely
dexterous
however
coarse
and
heavy
he
may
look
he
must
have
preserved
that
fragment
as
a
weapon
for
his
own
defence
as
a
means
of
keeping
a
hold
over
his
accomplices
i
nowadays
suspect
that
influenced
by
some
motive
which
remains
obscure
he
was
the
great
artisan
of
the
iniquity
perhaps
he
was
merely
guided
by
a
spirit
of
fidelity
towards
his
chief
father
crabot
perhaps
there
has
been
some
skeleton
between
them
since
that
suspicious
affair
of
the
donation
of
valmarie
perhaps
too
philibin
was
actuated
simply
by
militant
faith
and
a
desire
to
promote
the
triumph
of
the
church
at
all
events
he
a
terrible
fellow
a
man
of
determination
and
action
by
the
side
of
whom
that
noisy
empty
brother
fulgence
is
merely
a
vain
fool
marc
had
begun
to
ponder
philibin
father
philibin
yes
i
was
altogether
mistaken
about
him
even
after
the
trial
i
still
thought
him
a
worthy
man
a
man
of
upright
nature
even
if
warped
by
his
surroundings
yes
yes
he
was
the
great
culprit
the
artisan
of
forgery
and
falsehood
but
david
again
turned
to
delbos
said
he
philibin
should
have
kept
the
corner
which
he
tore
from
the
slip
you
surely
do
expect
that
he
will
give
it
to
you
if
you
ask
him
for
it
do
you
no
the
advocate
answered
with
a
laugh
before
attempting
anything
decisive
i
should
like
to
reflect
and
ascertain
if
there
is
no
means
of
securing
the
irrefutable
proof
moreover
a
demand
for
the
revision
of
a
case
is
a
very
serious
matter
and
nothing
ought
to
be
left
to
chance
let
me
complete
our
case
if
i
can
give
me
a
few
days
two
or
three
weeks
if
necessary
and
then
we
will
act
on
the
morrow
marc
understood
by
his
wife
manner
that
her
grandmother
had
spoken
out
and
that
the
congregations
from
father
crabot
to
the
humblest
of
the
ignorantines
were
duly
warned
the
affair
suddenly
burst
into
life
again
there
came
increasing
agitation
and
alarm
informed
as
they
were
of
the
discovery
of
the
duplicate
conscious
that
the
innocent
man
family
were
now
on
the
road
to
the
truth
hourly
expecting
to
see
brother
gorgias
denounced
the
guilty
ones
brother
fulgence
father
philibin
and
father
crabot
returned
to
the
fray
striving
to
hide
their
former
crime
by
committing
fresh
ones
they
divined
that
the
masterpiece
of
iniquity
which
they
had
reared
so
laboriously
and
defended
so
fiercely
was
now
in
great
peril
and
yielding
to
that
fatality
whereby
one
lie
inevitably
leads
to
endless
others
they
were
ready
for
the
worst
deeds
in
order
to
save
their
work
from
destruction
besides
it
was
no
mere
question
of
protecting
themselves
the
salvation
of
the
church
would
depend
on
the
battle
if
the
infamous
structure
of
falsehood
should
collapse
would
not
the
congregations
be
buried
beneath
it
the
brothers
school
would
be
ruined
closed
while
the
secular
school
triumphed
the
business
would
be
seriously
damaged
customers
would
desert
them
their
shrine
of
antony
of
padua
would
be
reduced
to
paltry
profits
the
college
of
valmarie
likewise
would
be
threatened
the
jesuits
would
be
forced
to
quit
the
region
which
they
now
educated
under
various
disguises
and
all
religious
influence
would
decline
the
breach
in
the
flanks
of
the
church
would
be
enlarged
and
free
thought
would
clear
the
highway
to
the
future
how
desperate
therefore
was
the
resistance
how
fiercely
did
the
whole
clerical
army
arise
in
order
that
it
might
not
be
compelled
to
cede
aught
of
the
wretched
region
of
error
and
dolour
which
for
ages
it
had
steeped
in
night
before
brother
gorgias
was
even
denounced
his
superiors
felt
it
necessary
to
defend
him
to
cover
him
at
all
costs
to
forestall
the
threatened
attack
by
concocting
a
story
which
might
prove
his
innocence
at
the
first
moment
however
there
was
terrible
confusion
the
brother
was
seen
hurrying
wildly
on
his
long
thin
legs
along
the
streets
of
maillebois
and
the
roads
of
the
neighbourhood
with
his
eagle
beak
set
between
his
projecting
his
deep
black
eyes
with
their
thick
brows
and
his
grimacing
mouth
he
resembled
a
fierce
scoffing
bird
of
prey
in
the
course
of
one
day
he
was
seen
on
the
road
to
valmarie
then
quitting
the
residence
of
philis
the
mayor
of
maillebois
then
alighting
from
a
train
which
had
brought
him
from
beaumont
moreover
both
in
the
town
and
the
surrounding
country
many
cassocks
and
frocks
were
encountered
hurrying
hither
and
thither
thus
testifying
to
a
perfect
panic
it
was
only
on
the
morrow
that
the
meaning
of
the
agitation
was
made
evident
by
an
article
in
petit
announcing
in
violent
language
that
the
whole
simon
affair
was
to
be
revived
by
the
friends
of
the
ignoble
jew
who
were
about
to
agitate
the
region
by
denouncing
a
worthy
member
of
one
of
the
religious
orders
the
holiest
of
men
brother
gorgias
was
not
yet
named
but
from
that
moment
a
fresh
article
appeared
every
day
and
by
degrees
the
version
of
the
affair
which
the
brother
superiors
had
concocted
was
set
out
in
opposition
to
the
version
which
it
was
foreseen
would
be
given
by
david
though
the
latter
had
revealed
it
to
nobody
however
the
desire
of
the
clericals
was
to
wreck
it
beforehand
everything
was
flatly
denied
it
was
impossible
that
brother
gorgias
could
have
paused
before
window
on
the
night
of
the
crime
for
witnesses
had
proved
that
he
had
already
returned
to
the
school
at
ten
besides
the
initialling
on
the
was
not
his
for
the
experts
had
fully
recognised
simon
handwriting
and
everything
could
be
easily
explained
simon
having
procured
a
writing
slip
had
imitated
the
brother
paraph
which
he
had
found
in
one
of
zéphirin
copybooks
then
as
he
knew
that
the
slips
were
stamped
at
the
brothers
school
he
had
torn
off
one
corner
with
diabolical
cunning
in
order
to
create
a
belief
in
some
precaution
taken
by
the
murderer
his
infernal
object
being
to
cast
the
responsibility
of
his
own
crime
on
some
servant
of
god
and
thereby
gratify
the
hatred
of
the
church
which
possessed
him
that
he
was
fated
to
everlasting
damnation
and
this
extravagant
story
repeated
every
day
soon
became
the
of
the
readers
whom
the
newspaper
debased
and
poisoned
with
its
falsehoods
it
should
be
mentioned
however
that
at
the
first
moment
there
was
a
little
uncertainty
and
hesitation
for
other
explanations
had
been
circulated
and
brother
gorgias
himself
appeared
to
have
made
some
curious
statements
formerly
hidden
away
in
the
background
now
suddenly
thrust
into
full
light
this
brother
gorgias
was
an
extraordinary
character
the
countess
de
quédeville
the
former
owner
of
valmarie
had
endeavoured
to
transform
his
father
jean
plumet
a
poacher
into
a
kind
of
gamekeeper
he
the
son
had
never
known
his
mother
a
hussy
who
rambled
about
the
woods
for
she
had
disappeared
soon
after
his
birth
then
his
father
had
been
shot
one
night
by
an
old
fellow
poacher
and
the
boy
at
that
time
twelve
years
old
had
remained
at
valmarie
protected
by
the
countess
and
becoming
the
playfellow
of
her
grandson
gaston
with
the
exact
circumstances
of
whose
death
while
walking
out
with
father
philibin
he
was
doubtless
well
acquainted
as
well
as
with
all
that
had
ensued
when
the
last
of
the
quédevilles
died
and
bequeathed
the
estate
to
father
crabot
the
two
jesuits
had
never
ceased
to
take
an
interest
in
him
and
it
was
thanks
to
them
that
he
had
become
an
ignorantine
in
spite
it
was
said
of
serious
circumstances
which
tended
to
prevent
it
for
these
reasons
certain
folk
suspected
the
existence
of
some
corpse
between
the
two
jesuit
fathers
and
their
compromising
inferior
at
the
same
time
brother
gorgias
was
cited
as
an
admirable
member
of
his
cloth
one
truly
imbued
with
the
holy
spirit
he
possessed
faith
that
sombre
savage
faith
which
pictures
man
as
a
weakling
a
prey
to
perpetual
sin
ruled
by
an
absolute
master
a
deity
of
wrath
and
punishment
that
deity
alone
reigned
it
was
for
the
church
to
visit
his
wrath
upon
the
masses
whose
duty
it
became
to
bow
their
heads
in
servile
submission
until
the
day
of
resurrection
dawned
amid
the
delights
of
the
heavenly
kingdom
he
brother
gorgias
often
sinned
himself
but
he
invariably
confessed
his
transgression
with
a
vehement
show
of
repentance
striking
his
breast
with
both
fists
and
humbling
himself
in
the
mud
then
he
rose
again
absolved
at
rest
displaying
the
provoking
serenity
of
a
pure
conscience
he
had
paid
his
debt
and
he
would
owe
nothing
more
until
the
weakness
of
his
flesh
should
cast
him
into
sin
again
as
a
lad
he
had
roamed
the
woods
growing
up
amid
poaching
and
thieving
and
hiding
himself
away
with
the
little
hussies
of
the
district
later
after
joining
the
ignorantines
he
had
displayed
the
keenest
appetites
showing
himself
a
big
eater
a
hard
drinker
with
inclinations
towards
lubricity
and
violence
but
as
he
said
in
that
humble
scoffing
threatening
way
of
his
to
fathers
philibin
and
crabot
whenever
they
reproached
him
for
some
too
serious
prank
did
not
everybody
sin
did
not
everybody
need
forgiveness
half
amusing
half
alarming
them
he
won
their
pardon
so
sincere
and
stupendous
did
his
remorse
appear
remorse
which
sometimes
impelled
him
to
fast
for
a
week
at
a
stretch
and
to
wear
studded
with
small
sharp
nails
next
to
his
skin
it
was
indeed
on
this
account
that
he
had
been
always
well
noted
by
his
superiors
who
recognised
that
he
possessed
the
genuine
religious
spirit
the
spirit
which
when
his
monkish
vices
ran
riot
atoned
for
them
with
the
avenging
flagellation
of
penitence
now
on
the
revival
of
the
simon
case
brother
gorgias
made
the
mistake
of
saying
too
much
in
the
course
of
his
first
confidential
chats
with
the
writers
of
petit
no
doubt
his
superiors
had
not
yet
expressly
imposed
their
own
version
on
him
and
he
was
too
intelligent
to
be
blind
to
its
exceeding
absurdity
as
another
copy
of
the
writing
slip
one
bearing
his
paraph
had
been
discovered
it
must
have
seemed
to
him
ridiculous
to
deny
that
this
paraph
was
his
writing
all
the
experts
in
the
world
would
never
prevent
full
light
from
being
thrown
on
that
point
thus
he
gave
some
inkling
of
a
version
of
his
own
one
which
was
more
reasonable
than
that
of
his
superiors
and
in
which
a
part
of
the
truth
appeared
for
instance
he
allowed
it
to
be
supposed
that
he
had
indeed
halted
for
a
moment
outside
zéphirin
open
window
on
the
night
of
the
crime
that
he
had
engaged
in
a
friendly
chat
with
the
little
hunchback
and
that
he
had
scolded
him
on
seeing
on
his
table
a
which
he
had
taken
from
the
school
without
permission
next
however
had
come
falsehood
he
gorgias
had
gone
off
the
child
had
closed
his
window
then
simon
must
have
come
and
have
committed
the
horrid
crime
satan
suddenly
inspiring
him
to
make
use
of
the
after
which
he
had
opened
the
window
afresh
in
order
to
let
it
appear
that
the
murderer
had
fled
that
way
but
although
this
version
of
the
affair
was
at
the
first
moment
given
by
the
newspaper
which
declared
that
it
emanated
from
a
most
reliable
source
it
was
on
the
morrow
contradicted
energetically
even
by
brother
gorgias
himself
who
repaired
expressly
to
the
newspaper
office
to
enter
his
protest
he
then
swore
on
the
gospel
that
he
had
gone
straight
home
on
the
evening
of
the
crime
and
that
the
initialling
on
the
was
a
forgery
in
simon
handwriting
even
as
the
experts
had
demonstrated
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
compelled
to
accept
the
concoction
of
his
superiors
in
order
that
he
might
be
backed
up
and
saved
by
them
he
grumbled
over
it
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
impatiently
for
it
seemed
to
him
an
extremely
stupid
version
but
at
the
same
time
he
bowed
to
the
decision
of
the
others
even
though
he
foresaw
that
their
system
of
defence
must
eventually
crumble
to
pieces
at
this
moment
brother
gorgias
with
his
scoffing
impudence
and
his
heroic
mendacity
was
really
superb
but
then
was
not
the
deity
behind
him
was
he
not
lying
in
order
to
save
holy
church
knowing
too
that
absolution
would
wash
away
his
sin
he
even
dreamt
of
the
palms
of
martyrdom
each
pious
act
of
infamy
that
he
perpetrated
would
entitle
him
to
another
joy
in
heaven
from
that
moment
then
he
became
merely
a
docile
instrument
in
the
hands
of
brother
fulgence
behind
whom
father
philibin
was
secretly
acting
under
the
discreet
orders
of
father
crabot
their
tactics
were
to
deny
everything
even
what
was
for
fear
lest
the
smallest
breach
in
the
sacred
wall
of
the
congregations
should
prove
the
beginning
of
inevitable
ruin
and
although
their
absurd
version
of
the
affair
might
seem
idiotic
to
people
possessed
of
logical
minds
it
would
none
the
less
long
remain
the
only
truth
accepted
by
the
mass
of
the
faithful
with
whom
they
could
presume
to
do
anything
knowing
as
they
did
their
boundless
fathomless
credulity
the
clericals
then
having
assumed
the
offensive
without
waiting
for
gorgias
to
be
denounced
brother
fulgence
in
particular
displayed
the
most
intemperate
zeal
at
times
of
great
emotion
his
father
the
mad
doctor
who
had
died
in
an
asylum
seemed
to
revive
in
him
with
his
brain
all
fogged
unhinged
by
vanity
and
ambition
he
yielded
to
the
first
impulse
that
came
to
him
ever
dreaming
of
doing
some
mighty
service
to
the
church
which
would
raise
him
to
the
head
of
his
order
thus
in
the
earlier
stages
of
the
simon
affair
he
had
lost
the
little
which
he
had
previously
shown
for
he
had
hoped
that
the
case
would
yield
him
the
glory
he
coveted
and
now
that
it
was
revived
he
once
more
became
delirious
he
was
constantly
to
be
seen
hurrying
along
the
streets
of
maillebois
little
dark
and
lean
with
the
folds
of
his
gown
flying
about
him
as
if
a
gale
were
carrying
him
away
whenever
he
entered
into
conversation
he
defended
his
school
with
passionate
eagerness
calling
on
heaven
to
witness
the
angelic
purity
of
his
assistants
as
for
the
abominable
rumours
which
had
been
circulated
long
ago
respecting
some
brothers
who
had
been
so
horribly
compromised
that
it
had
been
necessary
to
conjure
them
away
with
the
greatest
speed
all
those
infamous
tales
were
inventions
of
the
devil
in
this
respect
perhaps
however
contrary
to
the
truth
his
vehement
declarations
might
be
brother
fulgence
in
the
first
instance
made
them
in
all
good
faith
for
he
lived
very
much
in
another
world
far
from
mere
reason
but
he
soon
found
himself
caught
beneath
the
millstone
of
falsehood
it
became
necessary
that
he
should
lie
knowingly
and
deliberately
and
he
did
so
at
last
with
a
kind
of
devout
rage
for
the
very
love
of
god
was
he
not
himself
chaste
had
he
not
always
wrestled
against
temptation
that
was
so
and
he
therefore
made
it
his
duty
to
guarantee
the
absolute
chastity
of
his
entire
order
he
answered
for
the
brothers
who
stumbled
by
the
way
he
denied
to
laymen
the
right
of
judging
them
for
the
laymen
belonged
merely
to
the
flock
they
knew
nought
of
the
temple
if
then
brother
gorgias
had
sinned
he
owed
account
of
it
to
god
only
not
to
man
as
a
member
of
a
religious
order
he
had
ceased
to
be
liable
to
human
justice
in
this
way
consumed
by
his
craving
to
thrust
himself
forward
brother
fulgence
went
on
and
on
impelled
by
skilful
and
discreet
hands
which
piled
all
responsibilities
upon
his
shoulders
it
was
not
difficult
to
divine
that
father
philibin
stood
behind
him
in
the
gloom
father
philibin
who
in
his
turn
was
the
instrument
of
father
crabot
but
how
supple
and
how
powerful
a
one
retaining
his
personality
even
amidst
his
obedience
he
willingly
exaggerated
the
characteristics
of
his
peasant
origin
affecting
the
heavy
of
some
son
of
the
soil
yet
he
was
full
of
the
shrewdest
craft
endowed
with
the
patience
needed
for
long
enterprises
which
he
conducted
with
wonderful
dexterity
he
was
always
striving
to
attain
some
mysterious
object
but
he
made
no
stir
he
showed
no
personal
ambition
the
only
joy
he
coveted
was
that
of
seeing
his
work
prosper
supposing
him
to
be
possessed
of
faith
it
must
have
been
a
desire
to
serve
his
superiors
and
the
church
that
impelled
him
to
fight
on
like
an
unknown
unscrupulous
soldier
as
prefect
of
the
studies
at
valmarie
he
there
kept
a
watch
over
everything
busied
himself
with
everything
for
however
massive
his
build
he
was
very
active
mingling
with
the
pupils
of
the
college
playing
with
them
watching
them
studying
them
diving
to
the
very
depths
of
their
souls
ascertaining
everything
he
could
about
their
relatives
and
their
friends
he
possessed
the
master
eye
the
mind
which
stripped
the
brains
and
hearts
of
others
at
times
it
was
said
he
shut
himself
up
with
father
crabot
the
rector
who
affected
to
direct
the
establishment
from
on
high
never
attending
personally
to
the
education
of
the
boys
and
to
him
father
philibin
communicated
his
notes
his
reports
his
many
documents
containing
the
most
complete
and
secret
particulars
about
each
pupil
it
was
asserted
that
father
crabot
who
prudently
made
it
a
principle
to
keep
no
papers
whatever
did
not
approve
of
philibin
practice
of
collecting
and
cataloguing
documents
yet
in
recognition
of
his
great
services
he
let
him
do
so
regarding
himself
meantime
as
the
directing
hand
the
superior
mind
which
made
use
of
the
other
indeed
did
he
not
reign
from
his
austere
little
cell
over
all
the
fine
folk
of
the
department
did
not
the
ladies
whom
he
confessed
the
families
whose
children
were
educated
at
valmarie
belong
to
him
by
virtue
of
the
might
of
his
sacred
ministry
he
flattered
himself
that
it
was
he
who
wove
and
disposed
the
huge
net
in
which
he
hoped
to
capture
one
and
all
when
in
reality
it
was
more
frequently
father
philibin
who
covertly
prepared
the
various
campaigns
and
ensured
victory
in
the
simon
case
in
particular
the
latter
seemed
to
have
been
the
hidden
artisan
who
recoiled
from
no
task
however
dark
and
base
it
might
be
the
politic
man
whom
nothing
could
disgust
who
had
remained
the
friend
of
that
vicious
but
youth
georges
plumet
nowadays
the
terrible
brother
gorgias
following
him
through
life
protecting
him
because
he
was
as
dangerous
as
useful
and
doing
all
that
could
be
done
to
extricate
him
from
that
frightful
affair
the
murder
of
little
zéphirin
in
order
no
doubt
that
he
philibin
himself
might
not
come
to
grief
in
it
in
the
company
of
his
superior
father
crabot
that
glory
of
the
church
now
once
again
maillebois
became
impassioned
though
as
yet
there
were
only
rumours
of
the
criminal
devices
which
the
jews
were
preparing
in
order
to
set
the
devoted
brother
gorgias
that
holy
man
revered
by
the
entire
district
in
the
place
of
that
infamous
scoundrel
simon
extraordinary
efforts
were
made
to
induce
the
school
parents
even
those
whose
children
attended
the
secular
school
to
condemn
the
revival
of
the
affair
people
talked
as
if
the
streets
had
been
mined
by
some
hidden
band
of
scoundrels
the
enemies
of
god
and
france
who
had
resolved
to
blow
up
the
town
as
soon
as
a
certain
signal
should
reach
them
from
abroad
at
a
sitting
of
the
municipal
council
mayor
philis
ventured
to
allude
to
a
vague
danger
threatening
the
locality
and
denounced
the
jews
who
were
secretly
piling
up
millions
for
the
diabolical
work
then
becoming
more
precise
he
condemned
the
impious
doings
of
the
schoolmaster
that
marc
froment
of
whom
he
had
hitherto
failed
to
rid
the
town
but
he
was
still
watching
him
and
this
time
he
hoped
that
he
would
compel
the
academy
inspector
to
show
exemplary
severity
the
successive
versions
which
petit
had
given
of
marc
share
in
the
revival
of
the
affair
had
cast
confusion
into
the
minds
of
many
folk
there
was
certainly
a
question
of
a
document
found
at
the
house
of
mesdames
milhomme
the
stationers
but
some
people
spoke
also
of
another
abominable
forgery
perpetrated
by
simon
and
others
of
a
crushing
document
which
proved
the
complicity
of
father
crabot
the
only
certain
thing
was
that
general
jarousse
had
paid
another
visit
to
his
cousin
madame
edouard
that
poor
relation
whose
existence
he
so
willingly
forgot
one
morning
he
had
been
seen
arriving
and
rushing
into
the
little
shop
whence
he
had
emerged
half
an
hour
later
looking
extremely
red
and
the
result
of
his
tempestuous
intervention
was
that
madame
alexandre
and
her
son
sébastien
now
convalescent
started
on
the
morrow
for
the
south
of
france
while
madame
edouard
continued
to
manage
the
shop
to
the
complete
satisfaction
of
the
clerical
customers
she
ascribed
the
absence
of
her
to
the
latter
maternal
anxiety
for
only
a
sojourn
in
a
warm
climate
would
restore
sébastien
to
health
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
was
quite
ready
to
recall
madame
alexandre
in
the
interests
of
their
business
should
the
secular
school
prove
victorious
in
the
coming
contest
amid
the
rumbling
of
the
great
storm
which
was
rising
marc
endeavoured
to
discharge
his
duties
as
schoolmaster
with
all
correctitude
the
affair
was
now
in
david
hands
and
in
that
respect
he
marc
merely
had
to
wait
until
he
could
assist
him
with
his
evidence
thus
never
had
he
devoted
himself
more
entirely
to
his
pupils
striving
to
inspire
them
with
reason
and
kindliness
for
his
active
share
in
the
reparation
of
one
of
the
most
monstrous
iniquities
of
the
age
had
filled
him
with
greater
fervour
than
ever
for
the
cause
of
human
solidarity
with
geneviève
he
showed
himself
very
affectionate
endeavouring
to
avoid
all
subjects
on
which
they
disagreed
attentive
only
it
seemed
to
those
little
trifles
which
are
yet
of
great
importance
in
one
daily
life
but
whenever
his
wife
returned
from
a
visit
to
her
relations
he
divined
that
she
was
nervous
impatient
more
and
more
exasperated
with
him
her
mind
being
full
of
stories
which
she
had
heard
from
his
enemies
thus
he
could
not
always
avoid
quarrels
which
gradually
became
more
and
more
venomous
and
deadly
one
evening
hostilities
broke
out
on
the
subject
of
that
unhappy
man
férou
tragic
tidings
had
reached
marc
during
the
day
a
sergeant
to
whom
férou
had
behaved
rebelliously
had
shot
him
dead
with
a
revolver
marc
on
going
to
see
the
widow
had
found
her
in
her
wretched
home
weeping
and
begging
death
to
take
her
also
together
with
her
younger
daughters
even
as
it
had
compassionately
taken
the
eldest
one
already
marc
felt
that
férou
frightful
fate
was
the
logical
of
his
career
the
poor
schoolmaster
scorned
embittered
to
the
point
of
rebellion
driven
from
his
post
deserting
in
order
that
he
might
not
have
to
pay
to
the
barracks
the
debt
which
he
had
already
paid
in
part
to
the
school
then
conquered
by
hunger
forcibly
incorporated
in
the
army
when
he
returned
to
succour
his
despairing
wife
and
children
and
ending
like
a
mad
dog
yonder
under
the
flaming
sky
amid
the
torturing
life
of
a
disciplinary
company
at
the
same
time
in
presence
of
the
sobbing
wife
and
her
stupefied
daughters
in
presence
of
those
poor
ragged
waifs
whom
the
iniquity
of
the
social
system
cast
into
the
last
agony
marc
brotherly
and
humane
nature
was
stirred
to
furious
protest
even
in
the
evening
he
had
not
calmed
down
and
forgot
himself
so
far
as
to
speak
of
the
affair
to
geneviève
while
she
was
still
moving
about
their
bedroom
before
withdrawing
to
a
small
adjoining
chamber
where
of
recent
times
she
had
slept
by
herself
you
know
the
news
said
he
sergeant
has
blown
poor
brains
out
in
some
mutiny
in
algeria
i
saw
madame
férou
this
afternoon
she
is
quite
out
of
her
mind
it
was
really
deliberate
premeditated
murder
i
do
know
if
general
jarousse
who
showed
himself
so
harsh
in
férou
case
will
sleep
at
ease
in
any
case
some
of
the
blood
of
that
poor
madman
who
was
turned
into
a
wild
beast
will
cling
to
his
hands
would
be
very
foolish
of
the
general
not
to
sleep
geneviève
quickly
retorted
interpreting
marc
words
as
an
attack
on
her
principles
he
made
a
gesture
of
mingled
sorrow
and
indignation
but
recollecting
the
position
he
regretted
that
he
had
named
the
general
for
the
latter
was
one
of
father
crabot
dearest
penitents
and
at
one
moment
there
had
been
some
thought
of
using
him
for
a
military
a
bonapartist
by
repute
with
a
decorative
corpulent
figure
he
was
very
severe
with
his
men
though
jovial
at
bottom
and
fond
of
the
table
and
wenches
of
course
there
was
no
harm
in
that
but
after
some
negotiations
the
clericals
found
that
he
was
decidedly
too
big
a
fool
for
their
purpose
and
so
he
remained
a
mere
possible
makeshift
for
their
party
though
they
still
treated
him
with
some
consideration
we
first
knew
the
férou
family
at
le
moreux
marc
gently
resumed
were
already
so
poor
so
burdened
with
work
and
worries
in
their
wretched
school
that
i
can
not
think
of
that
unhappy
man
that
master
tracked
and
destroyed
like
a
wolf
without
a
feeling
of
anguish
and
compassion
at
this
geneviève
thoroughly
upset
her
earlier
displeasure
turning
into
a
kind
of
nervous
exasperation
burst
into
tears
yes
i
understand
you
perfectly
i
am
a
heartless
creature
eh
you
began
by
thinking
me
a
fool
and
now
you
believe
i
have
an
evil
heart
how
is
it
possible
for
us
to
continue
loving
one
another
if
you
treat
me
as
though
i
were
a
stupid
and
malicious
woman
astonished
and
grieved
at
having
provoked
such
an
outburst
marc
wished
to
pacify
his
wife
but
she
became
quite
wild
no
it
is
all
over
between
us
as
you
hate
me
more
and
more
each
day
it
is
best
that
we
should
separate
at
once
without
waiting
till
unworthy
things
happen
then
she
rushed
into
the
little
room
where
she
now
slept
and
locked
the
door
with
no
gentle
hand
he
when
he
saw
it
thus
shut
upon
him
remained
in
despair
with
tears
welling
to
his
eyes
hitherto
that
door
had
always
been
left
open
and
though
the
husband
and
wife
had
no
longer
shared
the
same
bed
they
had
remained
in
a
degree
together
able
to
converse
with
one
another
but
now
came
total
separation
henceforth
they
would
live
as
strangers
on
the
following
evenings
geneviève
in
the
same
manner
locked
herself
in
her
room
then
having
acquired
that
habit
she
never
showed
herself
to
marc
until
she
was
fully
dressed
as
the
time
approached
for
the
birth
of
the
child
she
expected
she
displayed
increasing
repugnance
for
the
slightest
caress
the
merest
touch
even
on
the
part
of
her
husband
he
had
ascribed
this
at
first
to
her
state
of
health
but
he
became
surprised
as
her
repulsion
developed
more
and
more
into
hatred
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
advent
of
another
child
ought
to
have
drawn
them
more
closely
together
and
his
anxiety
augmented
for
if
on
the
one
hand
he
was
aware
that
as
long
as
man
and
woman
are
united
by
love
no
rupture
is
possible
for
the
bitterest
quarrels
evaporate
amid
their
kisses
on
the
other
he
knew
that
as
soon
as
virtual
divorce
is
agreed
upon
the
slightest
conflict
may
prove
deadly
beyond
possibility
of
reconciliation
indeed
it
often
happens
when
homes
are
seen
collapsing
in
a
seemingly
inexplicable
manner
that
everything
can
be
traced
back
to
the
severance
of
the
carnal
bond
the
tie
of
passion
as
long
as
geneviève
had
hung
about
his
neck
marc
had
not
feared
the
attempts
which
were
made
to
take
her
from
him
he
knew
that
she
was
his
he
knew
that
no
power
in
the
world
could
conquer
love
but
if
she
ceased
to
regard
him
with
love
and
passion
would
not
the
fierce
efforts
of
his
enemies
at
last
wrest
her
from
him
and
as
day
by
day
he
saw
her
become
colder
and
colder
his
heart
was
wrung
by
increasing
intolerable
anxiety
at
one
moment
some
little
enlightenment
came
to
him
with
respect
to
the
change
in
his
wife
manner
he
learnt
that
she
had
quitted
abbé
quandieu
to
take
as
her
confessor
father
théodose
the
superior
of
the
capuchins
who
so
cleverly
the
miracles
of
antony
of
padua
the
reason
given
for
this
change
was
the
discomfort
the
unappeased
hungry
state
in
which
she
was
left
by
the
ministrations
of
the
priest
of
martin
he
was
now
too
lukewarm
for
her
ardent
faith
whereas
handsome
father
théodose
whose
fervour
was
so
lofty
would
nourish
her
with
the
wholemeal
bread
of
mysticism
which
she
needed
to
satisfy
her
in
reality
it
was
father
crabot
now
sovereign
lord
at
madame
duparque
house
who
had
decided
on
this
change
doubtless
in
order
to
hasten
victory
after
proceeding
with
such
artful
slowness
it
never
occurred
to
marc
to
suspect
geneviève
of
any
base
intrigue
with
the
capuchin
that
man
christlike
in
features
but
of
dark
complexion
whose
large
glowing
eyes
and
frizzy
beard
sent
his
penitents
into
raptures
marc
knew
his
wife
to
be
possessed
of
too
much
loyalty
and
too
much
dignity
both
of
mind
and
body
a
dignity
that
had
never
forsaken
her
even
in
moments
of
the
most
passionate
rapture
but
without
carrying
matters
as
far
as
that
was
it
not
admissible
that
the
growing
influence
of
father
théodose
was
in
part
the
domination
of
a
handsome
man
over
a
woman
who
was
still
young
a
man
too
godlike
in
appearance
and
godlike
claiming
obedience
after
her
pious
conversations
with
father
théodose
after
the
long
hours
she
spent
in
the
confessional
geneviève
returned
to
her
husband
quivering
distracted
such
as
he
had
never
seen
her
when
she
retuned
from
her
visits
to
abbé
quandieu
in
her
intercourse
with
her
new
confessor
she
was
certainly
forming
some
mystical
passion
finding
some
new
food
for
her
craving
nature
perhaps
too
the
monk
availed
himself
of
her
perturbed
state
of
health
to
terrorise
her
indeed
was
not
the
father
of
the
child
she
bore
one
of
the
damned
she
repeatedly
spoke
of
that
child
in
a
despairing
way
as
if
seized
with
a
kind
of
terror
like
one
of
those
mothers
who
dread
lest
they
should
give
birth
to
a
monster
and
if
that
happily
should
not
come
to
pass
how
would
she
protect
the
child
from
surrounding
sin
whither
might
she
carry
her
babe
to
save
it
from
the
contamination
of
its
father
sacrilegious
home
all
this
threw
a
little
light
on
geneviève
rupture
with
marc
a
rupture
in
which
there
might
well
be
remorse
at
the
thought
that
her
child
was
also
the
child
of
an
unbeliever
then
a
vow
that
she
would
never
more
be
the
mother
of
that
unbeliever
children
and
finally
a
perversion
and
exasperation
of
love
which
dreamt
of
finding
satisfaction
henceforth
in
the
of
desire
yet
how
much
still
remained
obscure
and
how
cruelly
did
marc
suffer
as
he
saw
himself
forsaken
by
that
adored
wife
whom
the
church
was
wrenching
from
his
arms
in
order
that
by
torturing
him
it
might
annihilate
him
and
his
work
of
human
liberation
one
day
on
returning
home
after
one
of
her
long
conferences
with
father
théodose
geneviève
who
looked
both
excited
and
exhausted
said
to
louise
who
at
that
moment
came
in
from
school
at
five
you
will
have
to
go
to
confession
at
the
capuchins
if
you
do
not
confess
you
will
no
longer
be
received
at
the
catechism
class
but
marc
resolutely
intervened
while
allowing
louise
to
follow
the
catechism
class
he
had
hitherto
strongly
opposed
her
attendance
at
confession
will
not
go
to
the
capuchins
he
said
firmly
know
my
dear
that
i
have
given
way
on
every
other
point
but
i
will
not
allow
the
child
to
go
to
confession
not
exclaimed
geneviève
still
restraining
herself
can
not
repeat
my
reasons
before
the
child
but
you
know
them
and
i
will
not
allow
my
daughter
mind
to
be
soiled
under
the
pretext
of
absolving
her
of
trivial
faults
which
her
parents
alone
need
know
and
correct
an
explanation
indeed
had
taken
place
between
marc
and
geneviève
on
this
subject
in
his
opinion
it
was
most
loathsome
and
abominable
that
a
little
girl
should
be
initiated
to
the
passions
of
the
flesh
by
a
man
who
by
his
very
vow
of
chastity
might
be
led
to
every
curiosity
and
every
sexual
aberration
for
ten
priests
who
might
be
prudent
it
was
sufficient
there
should
be
one
of
unbalanced
mind
and
then
confession
became
filth
to
which
risk
marc
refused
to
expose
his
daughter
louise
besides
in
that
disturbing
promiscuity
that
secret
colloquy
amid
the
mystical
enervating
atmosphere
and
gloom
of
a
chapel
there
was
not
merely
the
possibility
of
demoralisation
for
a
girl
only
twelve
years
old
an
anxious
age
when
the
senses
begin
to
quicken
there
was
also
a
seizure
of
her
mind
and
person
for
whatever
she
might
become
later
girl
wife
and
mother
she
would
always
remain
the
initiate
of
that
minister
who
by
his
very
questions
had
violated
her
modesty
and
thereby
affianced
her
to
his
jealous
deity
from
that
time
forward
indeed
woman
by
her
avowals
belonged
to
her
confessor
became
his
trembling
obedient
thing
ever
ready
to
do
his
behests
to
serve
in
his
hands
as
an
instrument
of
investigation
and
enthralment
our
daughter
should
be
guilty
of
any
fault
marc
resumed
shall
confess
it
to
you
or
me
whenever
she
feels
a
need
to
do
so
that
will
be
more
logical
and
cleaner
geneviève
shrugged
her
shoulders
like
one
who
deemed
that
solution
to
be
both
blasphemous
and
grotesque
wo
discuss
the
matter
any
further
with
you
she
said
just
tell
me
this
if
you
prevent
louise
from
going
to
confession
how
will
she
be
able
to
go
to
her
first
communion
first
communion
but
is
it
not
settled
that
she
will
wait
till
her
twentieth
birthday
in
order
to
decide
that
question
herself
i
have
let
her
go
to
the
catechism
class
even
as
she
goes
to
her
of
history
and
sciences
that
is
in
order
that
she
may
form
an
opinion
and
decide
later
on
at
this
geneviève
anger
mastered
her
she
turned
towards
her
daughter
you
louise
what
do
you
think
what
do
you
desire
the
child
whose
usually
gay
face
had
become
quite
grave
had
listened
to
her
father
and
mother
in
silence
whenever
such
quarrels
arose
she
endeavoured
to
remain
neutral
from
a
fear
of
embittering
matters
her
intelligent
eyes
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
of
her
parents
as
if
begging
that
they
would
not
make
themselves
unhappy
on
her
account
for
she
was
grieved
indeed
to
find
that
she
was
so
constantly
the
cause
of
their
disputes
but
though
she
showed
great
deference
and
affection
for
her
mother
the
latter
felt
that
she
inclined
towards
her
father
whom
indeed
she
worshipped
and
whose
firm
sense
and
passion
for
truth
and
equity
she
had
inherited
for
a
moment
louise
remained
as
if
undecided
looking
at
her
parents
in
her
usual
affectionate
way
then
she
gently
said
i
think
what
i
wish
mamma
why
i
should
much
like
it
to
be
whatever
you
and
papa
might
agree
upon
but
does
papa
desire
seem
to
you
so
very
unreasonable
why
not
wait
a
little
the
mother
quite
beside
herself
refused
to
listen
any
further
is
not
an
answer
my
girl
she
cried
with
your
father
since
you
can
no
longer
show
me
either
respect
or
obedience
you
will
end
between
you
by
driving
me
from
the
house
then
she
rushed
away
and
shut
herself
up
in
her
little
room
as
she
always
did
nowadays
whenever
she
encountered
the
slightest
opposition
this
was
her
method
of
ending
their
quarrels
and
on
each
occasion
she
seemed
to
draw
farther
and
farther
away
from
her
husband
and
her
child
to
set
more
and
more
space
between
herself
and
the
family
fireside
of
other
days
her
belief
that
attempts
were
being
made
to
influence
her
daughter
in
order
that
the
child
might
cast
off
her
authority
was
strengthened
by
a
fresh
incident
after
long
and
skilful
manœuvring
mademoiselle
rouzaire
had
at
last
secured
the
post
of
first
assistant
teacher
at
beaumont
which
post
she
had
coveted
for
years
inspector
le
barazer
had
yielded
in
the
matter
to
the
pressing
applications
of
the
clerical
deputies
and
senators
at
the
head
of
whom
count
hector
de
sanglebœuf
marched
with
the
noisy
bustling
gait
of
a
great
captain
but
to
compensate
politically
for
this
step
le
barazer
with
his
usual
maliciousness
had
caused
the
vacant
post
at
maillebois
to
be
assigned
to
mademoiselle
mazeline
the
schoolmistress
at
jonville
whose
good
sense
marc
so
greatly
admired
perhaps
also
the
academy
inspector
who
still
covertly
supported
marc
had
desired
to
place
a
friend
beside
him
one
whose
object
would
be
the
same
as
his
own
who
would
not
try
to
thwart
him
at
every
step
as
mademoiselle
rouzaire
had
done
at
all
events
when
mayor
philis
in
the
name
of
the
municipal
council
complained
to
le
barazer
of
this
appointment
which
said
he
would
place
the
little
girls
of
maillebois
in
the
hands
of
an
unbelieving
woman
the
academy
inspector
affected
great
astonishment
what
had
he
not
acted
in
accordance
with
count
hector
de
sanglebœuf
pressing
application
was
it
his
fault
if
owing
to
promotions
among
the
school
staff
a
most
meritorious
person
of
whom
no
parents
had
ever
complained
had
become
entitled
in
due
order
to
the
post
at
maillebois
as
a
matter
of
fact
mademoiselle
mazeline
in
the
town
proved
very
successful
people
were
struck
by
her
gay
serenity
the
maternal
manner
in
which
from
the
very
first
day
she
gained
the
affection
of
her
pupils
all
gentleness
and
zeal
she
directed
her
efforts
in
such
wise
that
her
daughters
as
she
called
them
might
become
worthy
women
wives
and
mothers
but
she
did
not
take
them
to
mass
and
she
suppressed
processions
prayers
and
catechism
lessons
before
long
therefore
a
few
other
mothers
who
belonged
to
the
clerical
faction
like
geneviève
began
to
protest
indeed
though
she
had
no
cause
to
congratulate
herself
on
her
intercourse
with
mademoiselle
rouzaire
whose
intrigues
had
disturbed
her
home
she
now
seemed
to
regret
her
and
spoke
of
the
new
schoolmistress
as
a
most
suspicious
character
who
was
capable
of
the
blackest
enterprises
hear
me
louise
she
said
one
day
mademoiselle
mazeline
should
say
anything
wrong
to
you
you
must
tell
me
i
wo
allow
my
daughter
soul
to
be
stolen
from
me
marc
could
not
refrain
from
intervening
mazeline
stealing
souls
said
he
foolish
when
we
were
at
jonville
you
used
to
admire
her
as
i
did
no
woman
has
a
loftier
mind
or
a
more
tender
heart
naturally
you
back
her
up
geneviève
replied
are
well
fitted
to
understand
each
other
go
and
join
her
hand
our
daughter
over
to
her
since
i
am
no
longer
of
any
account
then
once
again
geneviève
hastened
to
her
room
where
little
louise
had
to
join
her
weep
with
her
and
entreat
her
for
hours
before
she
could
be
induced
to
attend
to
the
home
again
all
at
once
some
almost
incredible
news
reached
maillebois
throwing
the
town
into
no
little
emotion
advocate
delbos
who
had
gone
to
paris
and
addressed
himself
to
some
of
the
government
departments
laying
before
the
officials
the
famous
duplicate
furnished
by
madame
alexandre
had
prevailed
on
them
by
what
high
influence
nobody
knew
to
order
a
perquisition
in
father
philibin
rooms
at
valmarie
the
extraordinary
part
of
the
affair
was
the
speed
with
which
this
perquisition
was
made
the
commissary
of
police
arriving
at
the
college
quite
unexpectedly
then
at
once
examining
the
collection
of
documents
formed
by
the
prefect
of
the
studies
and
in
the
second
portfolio
he
opened
discovering
an
envelope
already
yellow
with
age
which
contained
the
fragment
of
the
torn
off
so
long
ago
there
was
no
question
of
denying
its
authenticity
for
when
placed
in
position
at
the
corner
of
the
mutilated
slip
it
fitted
exactly
it
was
added
that
father
philibin
whom
father
crabot
utterly
upset
by
the
affair
immediately
interrogated
had
made
a
frank
confession
explaining
his
conduct
by
a
kind
of
instinctive
impulse
his
hand
having
acted
before
his
mind
had
time
to
think
so
great
had
been
his
anxiety
on
seeing
the
stamp
of
the
brother
school
upon
the
when
he
found
the
latter
in
zéphirin
room
if
he
had
remained
silent
afterwards
this
was
because
a
careful
study
of
the
affair
had
convinced
him
that
simon
was
indeed
the
culprit
and
had
intentionally
made
use
of
what
was
evidently
a
gross
forgery
in
order
to
injure
religion
thus
father
philibin
gloried
in
his
act
for
by
tearing
off
that
corner
and
afterwards
preserving
silence
he
had
behaved
like
a
hero
who
set
holy
church
high
above
the
justice
of
men
would
not
a
vulgar
accomplice
have
destroyed
the
fragment
as
the
reverend
father
had
preserved
it
could
one
not
understand
that
it
had
been
his
intention
to
all
the
facts
whenever
it
might
become
advisable
to
do
so
such
was
the
language
held
by
some
of
his
partisans
but
there
were
folk
who
attributed
the
preservation
of
the
fragment
to
his
mania
for
keeping
even
the
smallest
scraps
of
paper
and
who
thought
also
that
he
had
wished
to
remain
in
possession
of
a
weapon
which
might
prove
useful
against
others
it
was
said
that
father
crabot
who
for
his
part
destroyed
even
the
cards
which
visitors
left
for
him
was
exasperated
with
his
colleague
and
that
in
his
surprise
and
fury
at
the
first
moment
he
had
cried
i
gave
him
orders
to
burn
everything
and
he
kept
that
in
any
case
on
the
evening
of
the
day
when
the
discovery
was
made
by
the
commissary
father
philibin
against
whom
as
yet
no
warrant
had
been
issued
disappeared
when
pious
souls
anxiously
inquired
what
had
become
of
him
they
were
told
that
father
poirier
the
provincial
of
beaumont
had
decided
to
send
him
to
a
convent
in
italy
to
observe
a
retreat
and
there
as
if
engulfed
he
was
at
once
buried
in
eternal
silence
the
revision
of
simon
case
now
appeared
to
be
inevitable
delbos
sent
for
david
and
marc
in
order
to
decide
in
what
form
the
necessary
application
to
the
minister
of
justice
should
be
made
the
discovery
of
the
corner
of
the
would
alone
suffice
for
the
sentence
of
the
court
of
beaumont
to
be
quashed
and
the
advocate
was
of
opinion
that
they
ought
to
content
themselves
with
this
discovery
and
for
the
time
at
all
events
leave
on
one
side
the
illegal
communication
which
judge
gragnon
had
made
to
the
jurors
moreover
the
circumstances
of
that
communication
now
difficult
of
proof
would
be
brought
to
light
during
the
new
investigations
which
must
ensue
meantime
as
the
truth
in
the
matter
of
the
was
manifest
as
the
report
of
the
handwriting
experts
was
entirely
upset
the
origin
of
the
stamped
and
initialled
slip
constituting
such
a
damaging
element
in
the
case
that
father
philibin
had
practised
dissimulation
and
falsehood
to
conceal
it
the
advocate
considered
it
best
to
assail
brother
gorgias
without
more
ado
when
marc
and
david
quitted
delbos
that
decision
had
been
adopted
and
on
the
morrow
david
addressed
to
the
minister
a
letter
in
which
he
formally
accused
brother
gorgias
of
having
committed
a
heinous
offence
on
little
zéphirin
and
murdered
him
for
which
crimes
his
david
brother
simon
had
been
in
penal
servitude
for
ten
years
emotion
then
reached
a
climax
on
the
day
after
the
discovery
of
the
corner
of
the
among
father
philibin
papers
there
had
come
an
hour
of
lassitude
and
discomfiture
among
the
most
ardent
supporters
of
the
church
this
time
the
battle
really
seemed
to
be
lost
and
petit
even
printed
an
article
in
which
the
conduct
of
the
reverend
jesuit
was
roundly
blamed
but
two
days
later
the
faction
had
recovered
its
and
the
very
same
newspaper
proceeded
to
canonise
theft
and
falsehood
philibin
hero
and
martyr
was
portrayed
amid
a
setting
of
palms
and
with
a
halo
about
his
head
a
legend
likewise
arose
showing
the
reverend
father
in
a
remote
convent
of
the
apennines
surrounded
by
wild
forests
there
wearing
a
next
his
skin
he
prayed
devoutly
both
by
day
and
by
night
and
offered
himself
in
sacrifice
for
the
sins
of
the
world
and
on
the
back
of
the
pious
little
pictures
which
circulated
showing
him
on
his
knees
there
was
a
prayer
by
repeating
which
the
faithful
might
gain
indulgences
the
resounding
accusation
launched
against
brother
gorgias
fully
restored
to
the
clericals
their
rageful
determination
to
attack
and
conquer
convinced
as
they
were
that
the
victory
of
the
jew
would
shake
the
congregations
in
a
terrible
fashion
and
leave
a
gaping
breach
in
the
very
heart
of
the
church
all
the
of
former
days
rose
up
again
more
uncompromising
than
ever
eager
to
conquer
or
to
die
and
the
old
battle
began
afresh
on
every
side
on
one
hand
all
the
men
who
believed
in
truth
and
equity
and
looked
to
the
future
on
the
other
all
the
reactionaries
the
believers
in
authority
who
clung
to
the
past
with
its
god
of
wrath
and
based
salvation
on
priests
and
soldiers
the
municipal
council
of
maillebois
again
quarrelled
about
schoolmaster
froment
families
were
rent
asunder
the
brothers
pupils
and
marc
stoned
one
another
on
the
place
de
la
république
after
lessons
then
too
the
fine
society
of
beaumont
was
utterly
upset
such
was
the
feverish
anxiety
of
all
who
had
participated
in
any
way
in
simon
trial
for
one
man
such
as
salvan
who
rejoiced
with
marc
at
each
successive
interview
how
many
there
were
who
no
longer
slept
o
nights
at
the
thought
that
all
the
iniquity
which
had
been
buried
was
about
to
be
exhumed
fresh
elections
were
impending
and
the
politicians
feared
lest
they
should
be
unseated
lemarrois
the
radical
the
of
beaumont
once
the
town
indispensable
man
was
terrified
by
the
rise
of
delbos
popularity
marcilly
the
amiable
ever
anxious
to
be
on
the
winning
side
floundered
in
uncertainty
no
longer
knowing
which
party
to
support
the
reactionary
senators
and
deputies
headed
by
the
fierce
hector
de
sanglebœuf
resisted
desperately
as
they
saw
the
storm
which
might
sweep
them
away
rising
all
round
in
the
government
world
and
the
university
world
the
anxiety
was
no
less
keen
prefect
hennebise
lamented
that
he
could
not
stifle
the
affair
rector
forbes
losing
his
depth
cast
everything
upon
the
shoulders
of
academy
inspector
le
barazer
who
alone
remained
calm
and
smiling
amid
the
tempest
while
depinvilliers
the
director
of
the
lycée
took
his
daughters
to
mass
despairingly
even
as
one
may
throw
oneself
into
a
river
and
inspector
mauraisin
in
anguish
and
astonishment
at
the
turn
which
things
were
taking
wondered
if
the
time
had
not
come
to
go
over
to
the
freemasons
footnote
the
french
freemasons
are
largely
identified
with
republican
and
but
the
emotion
was
particularly
keen
in
the
judicial
world
for
did
not
a
revision
of
the
former
trial
mean
a
new
trial
directed
against
the
judges
who
had
conducted
the
first
proceedings
and
if
the
papers
in
the
case
should
be
exhumed
and
examined
would
not
terrible
revelations
ensue
investigating
magistrate
daix
that
unlucky
honest
man
who
was
haunted
by
remorse
for
having
yielded
to
his
covetous
ambition
looked
livid
when
he
repaired
in
silence
each
morning
to
his
office
at
the
palace
of
justice
and
if
raoul
de
la
bissonnière
the
dapper
public
prosecutor
made
on
the
contrary
an
excessive
show
of
good
humour
and
ease
of
mind
one
could
divine
that
he
did
so
from
a
torturing
desire
to
prevent
his
fears
from
being
seen
as
for
presiding
judge
gragnon
who
was
the
most
compromised
of
all
he
seemed
to
have
aged
quite
suddenly
his
face
had
become
heavy
his
shoulders
bent
beneath
some
invisible
weight
and
he
dragged
his
big
body
about
with
shuffling
steps
unless
he
noticed
that
he
was
being
watched
when
with
a
suspicious
glance
he
made
an
effort
to
draw
himself
erect
meantime
the
gentlemen
ladies
had
once
more
transformed
their
into
hotbeds
of
intrigue
barter
and
propaganda
and
from
the
to
their
servants
from
the
servants
to
the
tradespeople
from
the
tradespeople
to
the
working
classes
the
whole
population
followed
on
becoming
more
and
more
crazed
amid
the
tempest
which
cast
men
and
things
into
general
dementia
the
sudden
of
father
crabot
whose
tall
and
elegant
figure
and
whose
handsome
gowns
of
fine
cloth
were
so
well
known
at
the
reception
hour
in
the
avenue
des
jaffres
was
much
remarked
he
ceased
to
show
himself
there
and
a
proof
of
excellent
taste
and
profound
piety
was
detected
in
his
desire
for
retreat
and
meditation
of
which
his
friends
spoke
with
devout
emotion
as
father
philibin
also
had
disappeared
the
only
one
of
the
superior
ecclesiastics
who
remained
in
the
front
rank
was
brother
fulgence
who
somehow
always
contrived
to
act
in
a
compromising
way
bestirring
himself
too
much
showing
indeed
such
clumsiness
at
each
step
he
took
that
nasty
rumours
began
to
circulate
among
the
clericals
in
accordance
no
doubt
with
some
order
from
valmarie
to
sacrifice
the
brother
but
the
hero
the
extraordinary
figure
of
the
time
one
that
became
more
and
more
amazing
every
day
was
brother
gorgias
who
met
the
accusation
brought
against
him
with
prodigious
audacity
on
the
very
evening
of
the
day
when
david
letter
denouncing
him
was
made
public
he
hastened
to
the
office
of
petit
to
answer
it
insulting
the
jews
inventing
extraordinary
stories
clothing
true
facts
with
falsehoods
of
genius
fit
to
disturb
the
soundest
minds
he
scoffed
too
asking
if
schoolmasters
were
in
the
habit
of
walking
about
with
in
their
pockets
and
he
denied
everything
both
paraph
and
stamp
explaining
that
simon
who
had
imitated
his
handwriting
might
very
well
have
procured
a
stamp
from
the
school
or
even
have
had
one
made
it
was
idiotic
but
he
nevertheless
proclaimed
this
version
in
such
a
thundering
voice
and
with
such
violent
gestures
that
it
was
accepted
and
became
official
truth
from
that
moment
petit
showed
no
hesitation
it
adopted
the
story
of
the
forged
stamp
as
it
had
adopted
that
of
the
forged
paraph
the
whole
theory
of
abominable
premeditation
on
the
part
of
simon
who
in
committing
his
crime
had
sought
with
infernal
cunning
to
cast
it
upon
a
holy
man
in
order
to
soil
the
church
and
this
imbecile
invention
impassioned
all
the
folk
who
were
brutified
by
centuries
of
catechism
and
bondage
brother
gorgias
rose
to
be
a
martyr
of
the
faith
like
father
philibin
he
could
no
longer
show
himself
without
being
acclaimed
women
kissed
the
hem
of
his
frock
children
asked
him
to
bless
them
while
he
impudent
and
triumphant
harangued
the
crowds
and
indulged
in
the
most
extravagant
mummery
like
a
popular
idol
a
mountebank
before
a
booth
certain
of
applause
yet
behind
all
that
assurance
those
who
were
warned
who
knew
the
truth
detected
the
anxious
distress
of
that
wretched
man
who
was
forced
to
play
a
part
the
folly
and
fragility
of
which
he
was
the
first
to
recognise
and
it
was
evident
that
in
him
one
simply
had
an
actor
on
the
stage
a
tragic
puppet
whose
strings
were
pulled
by
invisible
hands
though
father
crabot
had
hidden
himself
away
humbly
cloistered
himself
in
his
bare
cold
cell
at
valmarie
his
black
shadow
still
passed
across
the
scene
and
one
could
divine
that
his
were
the
dexterous
hands
which
pulled
the
strings
pushed
the
puppets
forward
and
toiled
for
the
triumph
of
the
congregations
amid
the
greatest
commotion
and
despite
the
opposition
of
all
the
coalesced
reactionary
forces
the
minister
of
justice
was
obliged
to
lay
the
application
for
revision
drawn
up
by
david
on
behalf
of
madame
simon
and
her
children
before
the
court
of
cassation
this
was
truth
first
victory
and
for
a
moment
the
clerical
faction
seemed
to
be
overwhelmed
but
on
the
morrow
the
struggle
began
afresh
even
the
court
of
cassation
was
cast
into
the
mud
insulted
every
morning
accused
of
having
sold

during
the
two
months
occupied
by

march
of
inexorable
justice
at

after
memorable
discussions
during
which
several

gave
a
high

of
healthy
and
courageous

superior
to

thunderclap
it
retained
the

declared
that
there
was
ground
for
revision
and
recognised
the
necessity
of
an
investigation
which
it
decided
to
conduct
itself
that
evening
marc
when
afternoon
lessons
were
over
found
himself
alone
in
his
little
garden
in
the
warm
twilight
of
springtime
louise
had
not
yet
come
in
from
school
for
mademoiselle
mazeline
whose
favourite
pupil
she
had
become
sometimes
kept
her
with
her
as
for
geneviève
ever
since
she
had
been
absent
at
her
grandmother
where
indeed
she
now
spent
nearly
all
her
time
and
despite
the
fresh
perfume
which
the
lilacs
shed
in
the
warm
air
marc
as
he
paced
the
garden
paths
was
pursued
by
bitter
torturing
thoughts
of
his
devastated
home
he
had
not
given
way
on
the
subject
of
confession
indeed
his
daughter
had
lately
quitted
the
catechism
class
the
priest
having
refused
to
receive
her
any
longer
if
she
did
not
come
to
him
by
way
of
the
confessional
but
morning
and
evening
alike
marc
had
to
contend
against
the
attacks
of
his
wife
who
was
exasperated
maddened
by
the
idea
that
louise
would
be
damned
and
that
she
herself
would
be
virtually
an
accomplice
in
it
as
she
could
not
find
the
strength
to
take
the
girl
in
her
arms
and
carry
her
to
the
tribunal
of
penitence
she
remembered
her
own
adorable
first
communion
the
loveliest
day
of
her
life
with
her
white
gown
the
incense
the
candles
the
gentle
jesus
to
whom
she
had
so
sweetly
affianced
herself
and
who
had
remained
her
only
real
spouse
the
spouse
of
a
divine
love
the
delights
of
which
she
vowed
it
were
the
only
ones
which
she
would
taste
henceforth
but
was
her
daughter
to
be
robbed
of
such
felicity
degraded
reduced
to
the
level
of
the
beasts
of
the
field
which
knew
no
religion
she
could
not
bear
such
a
thought
but
sought
every
possible
opportunity
to
wring
a
consent
from
her
husband
changing
the
family
hearth
into
a
battlefield
where
the
most
futile
incidents
gave
rise
to
endless
bickering
the
night
was
falling
slowly
and
peacefully
and
marc
on
whom
for
the
moment
a
feeling
of
great
lassitude
had
come
felt
astonished
that
he
should
be
able
to
resist
his
wife
with
a
courage
which
was
cruel
for
her
himself
and
their
daughter
all
his
old
spirit
of
tolerance
came
back
he
had
allowed
his
daughter
to
be
baptised
so
might
he
not
also
allow
her
to
make
her
first
communion
the
reasons
which
his
wife
urged
reasons
to
which
he
had
long
bowed
respect
of
individual
liberty
the
rights
of
a
mother
the
rights
of
conscience
were
not
without
weight
in
a
home
the
mother
necessarily
became
the
educator
and
initiator
particularly
when
girls
were
in
question
to
take
no
account
of
her
ideas
to
oppose
the
desires
of
her
mind
and
heart
meant
surely
the
wrecking
of
the
home
nought
was
left
of
the
bond
of
agreement
which
a
home
requires
to
flourish
all
happiness
was
destroyed
the
parents
and
their
child
lapsed
into
horrible
warfare
that
warfare
from
which
marc
own
home
once
so
united
and
so
sweet
now
suffered
and
thus
while
pacing
the
narrow
paths
of
his
little
garden
across
which
the
shadows
were
spreading
marc
asked
himself
whether
and
in
what
manner
he
might
give
way
again
in
order
to
restore
a
little
peace
and
happiness
a
feeling
of
remorse
tortured
him
for
was
not
his
misfortune
due
to
himself
his
share
of
responsibility
had
become
manifest
to
him
more
than
once
and
he
had
asked
himself
why
on
the
morrow
of
his
marriage
he
had
not
endeavoured
to
win
geneviève
over
to
his
own
belief
at
that
time
amid
the
first
revelation
of
love
she
had
indeed
belonged
to
him
she
had
cast
herself
into
his
arms
with
all
confidence
ready
to
mingle
with
him
in
such
wise
that
they
might
be
of
one
flesh
and
one
mind
he
alone
at
that
unique
hour
of
life
might
have
had
the
power
to
wrest
the
woman
from
the
priest
and
turn
the
child
of
the
ages
bending
beneath
the
dread
of
hell
into
the
conscious
companion
of
his
own
existence
a
companion
whose
mind
would
be
freed
opened
to
truth
and
equity
at
the
time
of
their
earliest
quarrels
geneviève
herself
had
cried
it
to
him
you
suffer
because
we
do
not
think
the
same
it
is
your
own
fault
you
should
have
taught
me
i
am
such
as
i
was
made
and
the
misfortune
is
that
you
did
not
know
how
to
make
me
anew
she
had
got
far
beyond
that
point
now
she
did
not
allow
that
he
could
possibly
influence
her
such
had
become
the
unshakable
pride
of
her
faith
nevertheless
he
bitterly
recalled
his
lost
opportunity
and
deplored
his
egotistical
adoration
during
the
delightful
springtime
of
their
married
life
when
he
had
never
ceased
to
admire
her
beauty
without
a
thought
of
diving
into
her
conscience
and
enlightening
her
true
he
had
not
then
imagined
that
he
would
become
an
artisan
of
truth
such
as
he
was
he
had
accepted
certain
compromises
imagining
that
he
was
strong
enough
to
remain
the
master
indeed
all
his
present
torture
arose
from
his
whilom
masculine
vanity
the
blind
weakness
of
his
early
love
he
knew
that
now
and
as
he
paused
before
a
lilac
bush
whose
flowers
open
since
the
previous
day
were
shedding
a
penetrating
perfume
around
a
sudden
flame
a
renewed
desire
to
fight
and
conquer
arose
within
him
even
if
he
had
formerly
failed
in
his
duty
was
that
a
reason
for
him
to
fail
in
it
now
by
allowing
his
daughter
to
wreck
her
life
in
the
same
way
as
her
mother
had
wrecked
hers
such
remissness
on
his
part
would
be
the
more
unpardonable
as
he
had
taken
on
himself
the
task
of
saving
the
children
of
others
from
the
falsehoods
of
the
centuries
perhaps
it
might
be
allowable
for
some
obscurely
situated
man
to
put
up
with
the
doings
of
a
bigot
wife
who
was
intent
on
crazing
her
daughter
with
foolish
and
dangerous
practices
but
how
could
he
accept
such
a
position
he
who
had
removed
the
crucifix
from
his
classroom
he
whose
teaching
was
strictly
secular
he
who
openly
proclaimed
the
necessity
of
saving
woman
from
the
church
if
one
desired
to
build
the
happy
city
would
not
his
acceptance
of
such
a
position
be
the
fullest
possible
confession
of
impotence
it
would
be
the
denial
and
the
annihilation
of
his
mission
he
would
lose
all
power
all
authority
to
ask
others
to
do
that
which
he
could
or
would
not
do
himself
in
his
own
home
and
what
an
example
of
hypocrisy
and
egotistical
weakness
would
he
not
give
to
his
daughter
who
was
acquainted
with
his
ideas
and
knew
him
to
be
opposed
to
confession
and
communion
would
she
not
wonder
why
he
tolerated
at
home
the
actions
which
he
condemned
when
their
neighbours
were
in
question
would
it
not
seem
to
her
that
he
thought
one
way
and
acted
another
ah
no
no
tolerance
had
become
impossible
he
could
no
longer
give
way
unless
he
desired
to
see
his
work
of
deliverance
crumble
beneath
universal
contempt
once
more
marc
began
to
walk
to
and
fro
under
the
paling
sky
where
the
first
stars
were
beginning
to
twinkle
one
of
the
triumphs
of
the
church
was
that
freethinking
parents
did
not
remove
their
children
from
its
control
bound
as
they
were
by
social
usages
and
fearful
of
scandal
there
was
an
apprehension
among
them
that
they
might
fail
to
start
their
sons
in
life
or
find
husbands
for
their
daughters
if
the
children
did
not
at
least
pass
through
the
formal
routine
of
the
sacraments
so
who
would
begin
who
would
set
the
example
no
doubt
it
would
be
necessary
to
wait
a
very
long
time
for
a
general
change
the
time
which
science
might
require
to
destroy
dogma
as
a
matter
of
usage
even
as
it
had
already
destroyed
it
as
a
matter
of
sense
yet
it
was
the
duty
of
brave
minds
to
set
the
first
examples
examples
which
the
church
dreaded
and
which
nowadays
impelled
it
to
make
so
many
efforts
to
retain
the
support
and
favour
of
women
whom
it
had
so
long
brutalised
treated
as
daughters
of
the
devil
responsible
for
all
the
sins
of
the
world
it
seemed
to
marc
that
the
jesuits
who
by
a
stroke
of
genius
had
resolved
to
adapt
the
deity
to
the
requirements
of
human
passions
were
the
real
artisans
of
the
great
movement
which
had
placed
women
as
instruments
of
political
and
social
conquest
in
the
hands
of
the
priests
the
church
had
cursed
human
love
and
now
it
employed
it
it
had
treated
woman
as
a
monster
of
lewdness
from
whom
it
was
the
duty
of
the
saints
to
flee
yet
now
it
caressed
her
loaded
her
with
flattery
made
her
the
ornament
and
mainstay
of
the
sanctuary
having
resolved
to
exploit
her
power
over
man
indeed
sexuality
flames
among
the
candles
of
the
altars
the
priests
nowadays
accept
it
as
a
means
of
grace
use
it
as
a
trap
in
which
they
hope
to
recapture
and
master
man
does
not
all
the
disunion
the
painful
quarrel
of
contemporary
society
spring
from
the
divorce
existing
between
man
and
woman
the
former
half
freed
the
latter
still
a
serf
a
petted
hallucinated
slave
of
expiring
catholicism
the
problem
lies
in
that
we
men
should
not
leave
the
church
to
profit
by
the
mystical
rapture
in
which
it
steeps
our
daughters
and
our
wives
we
should
wrest
from
it
the
merit
of
the
spurious
deliverance
it
brings
to
them
we
should
deliver
them
really
from
all
their
fancies
and
take
them
from
the
church
to
ourselves
since
indeed
they
are
ours
even
as
we
are
theirs
marc
reflected
that
there
were
three
forces
in
presence
man
woman
and
the
church
and
instead
of
woman
and
the
church
being
arrayed
against
man
it
was
necessary
that
man
and
woman
should
be
arrayed
against
the
church
besides
were
not
man
and
wife
one
neither
could
act
without
the
other
whereas
united
in
flesh
and
in
mind
they
became
invincible
the
very
force
of
life
the
very
embodiment
of
happiness
in
the
midst
of
conquered
nature
and
the
one
sole
true
solution
suddenly
became
manifest
to
marc
woman
must
be
taught
enlightened
she
must
be
set
in
her
rightful
place
as
our
equal
and
our
companion
for
only
the
freed
woman
can
free
man
at
the
moment
when
calmed
and
comforted
marc
was
regaining
the
courage
he
needed
to
continue
fighting
he
heard
geneviève
come
in
and
went
to
join
her
in
the
classroom
where
a
little
vague
light
still
lingered
he
found
her
standing
there
and
though
the
birth
of
the
child
she
expected
was
now
near
at
hand
she
carried
herself
so
upright
in
such
an
aggressive
posture
with
such
brilliant
eyes
that
he
felt
a
supreme
storm
to
be
imminent
are
you
pleased
she
asked
him
curtly
with
what
my
darling
you
do
know
then
so
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
being
the
first
to
give
you
the
great
news
your
heroic
efforts
have
been
successful
the
news
has
just
arrived
by
telegraph
the
court
of
cassation
has
decided
in
favour
of
the
revision
of
the
affair
marc
raised
a
cry
of
intense
joy
unwilling
to
notice
the
tone
of
furious
irony
in
which
geneviève
had
announced
the
triumph
last
so
there
are
some
real
judges
after
all
the
innocent
man
will
suffer
no
longer
but
is
the
news
quite
certain
yes
quite
certain
i
had
it
from
honourable
people
to
whom
it
was
telegraphed
yes
the
abomination
is
complete
and
you
may
well
rejoice
in
geneviève
quivering
bitterness
there
was
an
echo
of
the
violent
scene
which
doubtless
she
had
just
witnessed
at
her
house
whither
some
priest
or
monk
some
friend
of
father
crabot
had
hastened
to
impart
the
tidings
of
the
catastrophe
which
imperilled
religion
but
marc
as
if
determined
not
to
understand
opened
his
arms
to
his
wife
saying
you
i
could
not
have
had
a
messenger
kiss
me
geneviève
brushed
him
aside
with
a
gesture
of
hatred
you
she
cried
because
you
have
been
the
artisan
of
an
infamous
deed
because
this
criminal
victory
over
religion
rejoices
you
it
is
your
country
your
family
yourself
that
you
cast
into
the
mire
in
order
to
save
that
filthy
jew
the
greatest
scoundrel
in
all
the
world
not
say
such
things
replied
marc
in
a
gentle
entreating
way
seeking
to
pacify
her
can
you
repeat
such
monstrous
words
you
who
used
to
be
so
intelligent
and
so
is
it
true
then
that
error
is
so
contagious
that
it
may
obscure
the
soundest
minds
just
think
a
little
you
know
all
simon
is
innocent
and
to
leave
him
still
in
penal
servitude
would
be
frightful
iniquity
a
source
of
social
rottenness
which
would
end
by
destroying
the
nation
no
she
cried
with
a
kind
of
mystical
exaltation
is
guilty
men
of
recognised
holiness
accused
him
and
accuse
him
still
and
to
regard
him
as
innocent
it
would
be
necessary
to
discard
all
faith
in
religion
to
believe
god
himself
capable
of
error
no
no
he
must
stay
at
the
galleys
for
on
the
day
of
his
release
nothing
divine
nothing
that
one
may
revere
would
be
left
on
earth
marc
was
becoming
impatient
can
not
understand
said
he
we
can
disagree
on
so
clear
a
question
of
truth
and
justice
heaven
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
has
there
is
no
truth
or
justice
outside
heaven
that
is
the
gist
of
it
all
that
explains
our
disagreement
and
torture
you
would
still
think
as
i
do
if
you
had
not
set
heaven
between
us
and
you
will
come
back
to
me
on
the
day
when
you
consent
to
live
on
earth
and
show
a
healthy
mind
and
a
sisterly
heart
there
is
only
one
truth
one
justice
such
as
science
establishes
under
the
control
of
human
certainty
and
solidarity
geneviève
was
becoming
exasperated
us
come
to
the
point
once
and
for
all
she
retorted
is
my
religion
that
you
wish
to
destroy
he
cried
is
against
your
roman
catholicism
that
i
fight
against
the
imbecility
of
its
teaching
the
hypocrisy
of
its
practices
the
perversion
of
its
worship
its
deadly
action
on
children
and
women
and
its
social
injuriousness
the
roman
catholic
church
that
is
the
enemy
of
whom
we
must
first
clear
the
path
before
the
social
question
before
the
political
question
comes
the
religious
question
which
bars
everything
we
shall
never
be
able
to
take
a
single
forward
step
unless
we
begin
by
striking
down
that
church
which
corrupts
and
poisons
and
murders
and
understand
me
fully
that
is
the
reason
why
i
am
resolved
not
to
allow
our
louise
to
confess
and
communicate
i
should
feel
that
i
was
not
doing
my
duty
that
i
was
placing
myself
in
contradiction
with
all
my
principles
and
lessons
if
i
were
to
allow
such
things
and
on
the
morrow
i
should
have
to
leave
this
school
and
cease
to
teach
the
children
of
others
for
lack
of
having
both
the
loyalty
and
the
strength
to
guide
my
own
child
towards
truth
the
only
real
and
only
good
truth
thus
i
shall
not
yield
on
the
matter
our
daughter
herself
will
come
to
a
decision
when
she
is
twenty
geneviève
now
quite
beside
herself
was
on
the
point
of
replying
when
louise
came
in
followed
by
mademoiselle
mazeline
who
having
detained
her
after
lessons
wished
to
explain
that
she
had
been
teaching
her
a
difficult
crochet
stitch
short
and
slight
possessed
of
no
beauty
but
extremely
charming
with
her
broad
face
her
large
loving
mouth
and
her
fine
black
eyes
glowing
with
ardent
sympathy
the
schoolmistress
called
from
the
threshold
have
you
no
light
i
want
to
show
you
the
clever
work
of
a
good
little
girl
but
geneviève
without
listening
sternly
called
the
child
to
her
so
it
you
louise
come
here
a
moment
your
father
is
again
torturing
me
about
you
he
is
now
positively
opposed
to
your
making
your
first
communion
well
i
insist
on
your
doing
so
this
year
you
are
twelve
years
old
you
can
delay
the
matter
no
longer
without
causing
a
scandal
but
before
deciding
on
my
course
i
wish
to
know
what
your
own
views
are
tall
as
she
was
already
louise
looked
almost
a
little
woman
showing
a
very
intelligent
face
in
which
her
mother
refined
features
seemed
to
mingle
in
an
expression
of
quiet
good
sense
which
she
had
inherited
from
her
father
with
an
air
of
affectionate
deference
she
answered
views
oh
mamma
i
can
have
none
only
i
thought
it
was
all
settled
as
papa
only
desire
is
that
i
should
wait
till
my
majority
then
i
will
tell
you
my
views
that
how
you
answer
me
unhappy
child
cried
her
mother
whose
irritation
was
increasing
still
wait
when
your
horrible
lessons
are
evidently
corrupting
you
and
robbing
me
more
and
more
of
your
heart
at
this
moment
mademoiselle
mazeline
made
the
mistake
of
intervening
but
she
did
so
like
a
good
soul
who
was
grieved
by
this
quarrel
in
a
home
whose
happiness
in
former
days
had
greatly
touched
her
my
dear
madame
froment
she
said
louise
is
very
fond
of
you
and
what
she
said
just
now
was
very
reasonable
geneviève
turned
violently
towards
the
schoolmistress
to
your
own
affairs
mademoiselle
i
wo
inquire
into
your
share
in
all
this
but
you
would
do
well
to
teach
your
pupils
to
respect
god
and
their
parents
this
is
not
your
home
remember
then
as
the
schoolmistress
withdrew
heavy
at
heart
and
saying
nothing
for
fear
lest
she
might
embitter
the
quarrel
the
mother
again
turned
to
the
girl
to
me
louise
and
you
marc
listen
to
me
also
i
have
had
enough
of
it
i
swear
to
you
that
i
have
had
enough
of
it
that
what
has
occurred
this
evening
what
has
just
been
said
has
filled
the
cup
to
overflowing
you
you
no
longer
have
any
love
for
me
you
torture
me
in
my
faith
and
you
try
to
drive
me
from
the
house
her
daughter
full
of
distress
and
agitation
was
weeping
in
a
corner
of
the
large
dim
room
and
the
heart
of
her
husband
who
stood
there
motionless
bled
as
he
heard
those
supreme
rending
words
both
he
and
the
child
raised
the
same
protest
you
from
the
house
you
do
all
you
can
to
render
it
unbearable
indeed
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
remain
longer
in
a
spot
where
all
is
scandal
error
and
impiety
where
every
word
and
every
gesture
wound
and
shock
me
i
have
been
told
twenty
times
that
it
was
not
a
fit
place
for
me
and
i
will
not
damn
myself
with
you
so
i
am
going
away
returning
whence
i
came
she
cried
those
last
words
aloud
with
extraordinary
vehemence
your
grandmother
eh
exclaimed
marc
my
grandmother
yes
that
is
an
asylum
a
refuge
full
of
sovereign
peace
they
at
least
know
how
to
understand
and
love
me
there
i
ought
never
to
have
quitted
that
pious
home
of
my
youth
there
is
nothing
here
to
detain
either
my
body
or
my
soul
she
went
towards
the
door
with
a
fierce
set
face
but
owing
to
her
condition
with
somewhat
unsteady
steps
louise
was
still
sobbing
violently
but
marc
making
a
last
effort
resolutely
strove
to
bar
the
way
my
turn
he
said
beg
you
to
listen
to
me
you
wish
to
return
whence
you
came
and
i
am
not
surprised
at
it
for
i
know
that
every
effort
has
been
made
there
to
wrest
you
from
me
it
is
a
house
of
mourning
and
vengeance
but
you
are
not
alone
remember
there
is
the
child
you
bear
and
you
can
not
take
it
from
me
in
that
way
to
hand
it
over
to
others
geneviève
was
standing
before
her
husband
who
on
his
side
leant
against
the
door
she
seemed
to
increase
in
stature
to
become
yet
more
resolute
and
stubborn
as
she
cast
in
his
face
these
words
am
going
away
expressly
in
order
to
take
that
child
from
you
and
place
it
beyond
the
reach
of
your
abominable
influence
i
will
not
have
you
make
a
pagan
of
that
child
and
ruin
it
in
mind
and
heart
as
you
have
ruined
this
unhappy
girl
here
it
is
my
child
i
suppose
and
you
surely
mean
to
beat
me
under
pretence
of
keeping
it
come
get
away
from
that
door
and
let
me
go
he
did
not
answer
he
was
making
a
superhuman
effort
to
abstain
from
force
such
as
anger
suggested
for
a
moment
they
looked
at
one
another
in
the
last
faint
gleam
of
the
expiring
light
away
from
that
door
she
repeated
harshly
understand
that
i
have
quite
made
up
my
mind
you
do
not
desire
a
scandal
do
you
you
would
have
nothing
to
gain
by
it
you
would
be
dismissed
and
prevented
from
continuing
what
you
call
your
great
work
the
teaching
of
those
children
whom
you
have
preferred
to
me
and
whom
you
will
turn
into
brigands
with
your
fine
lessons
yes
be
prudent
take
care
of
yourself
for
the
sake
of
your
school
a
school
of
the
damned
and
let
me
return
to
my
god
who
some
day
will
chastise
you
my
poor
wife
he
murmured
in
a
faint
voice
for
her
words
had
wounded
him
to
the
heart
it
is
not
you
yourself
who
speak
it
is
those
wretched
people
who
are
making
use
of
you
as
a
deadly
weapon
against
me
i
recognise
their
words
the
hope
of
a
drama
the
desire
to
see
me
dismissed
my
school
closed
my
work
destroyed
it
is
still
because
i
am
a
witness
a
friend
of
simon
whose
innocence
i
shall
soon
help
to
establish
that
they
wish
to
strike
me
down
is
it
not
and
you
are
right
i
do
not
desire
a
scandal
which
would
please
so
many
people
let
me
go
she
repeated
stubbornly
by
and
by
before
then
i
wish
you
to
know
that
i
still
love
you
love
you
even
more
than
ever
because
you
are
a
poor
sick
child
attacked
by
one
of
those
contagious
fevers
which
it
takes
so
much
time
to
cure
but
i
do
not
despair
for
at
bottom
you
are
a
good
and
healthy
creature
sensible
and
loving
when
you
choose
and
some
day
you
will
awaken
from
your
nightmare
besides
we
have
lived
together
for
nearly
fourteen
years
i
made
you
wife
and
mother
and
even
though
i
neglected
to
you
entirely
the
many
things
which
have
come
to
you
from
me
will
continue
to
assert
themselves
you
will
come
back
to
me
geneviève
she
laughed
with
an
air
of
bravado
do
not
think
so
she
said
will
come
back
to
me
he
repeated
in
a
voice
instinct
with
conviction
you
know
and
understand
the
truth
the
love
you
have
borne
me
will
do
the
rest
and
you
have
a
tender
heart
you
are
not
capable
of
long
injustice
i
have
never
done
you
violence
i
have
constantly
respected
your
wishes
and
now
as
you
wish
it
go
to
your
folly
follow
it
till
it
is
exhausted
as
there
is
no
other
means
of
curing
you
of
it
he
drew
aside
from
the
door
to
make
way
for
her
and
she
for
a
moment
seemed
to
hesitate
amid
the
quivering
gloom
which
was
enshrouding
that
dear
and
home
it
had
become
so
dark
that
marc
could
no
longer
see
her
face
which
had
contracted
while
she
listened
to
him
but
all
at
once
she
made
up
her
mind
exclaiming
in
a
choking
voice
then
louise
lost
amid
the
darkness
sprang
forward
in
her
turn
wishing
to
prevent
her
mother
departure
mamma
mamma
you
can
not
go
away
like
this
we
who
love
you
so
well
we
who
only
want
you
to
be
happy
but
the
door
had
closed
and
the
only
response
was
a
last
distant
cry
half
stifled
by
a
sound
of
rapid
footsteps
then
sobbing
and
staggering
louise
fell
into
her
father
arms
and
sinking
together
upon
one
of
the
forms
of
the
classroom
they
long
remained
there
weeping
together
night
had
completely
fallen
now
nothing
but
the
faint
sound
of
their
sobs
was
to
be
heard
in
the
large
dark
room
the
deep
silence
of
abandonment
and
mourning
filled
the
empty
house
the
wife
the
mother
had
gone
stolen
from
the
husband
and
the
child
in
order
that
they
might
be
tortured
cast
into
despair
before
marc
tearful
eyes
there
rose
the
whole
machination
the
hypocritical
underhand
efforts
of
years
which
now
wrenched
from
him
the
wife
whom
he
adored
in
order
to
weaken
him
and
goad
him
into
some
sudden
rebellion
which
would
sweep
both
his
work
and
himself
away
his
heart
bled
but
he
had
found
the
strength
to
accept
his
torture
and
none
would
ever
know
his
distress
for
none
could
see
him
sobbing
with
his
daughter
in
the
darkness
of
his
deserted
home
like
a
poor
man
who
had
nought
left
him
save
that
child
and
who
was
seized
with
terror
at
the
thought
that
she
likewise
might
be
wrested
from
him
some
day
a
little
later
that
same
evening
as
marc
had
to
conduct
a
course
of
evening
lessons
for
adults
the
four
gas
jets
of
the
classroom
were
lighted
and
students
flocked
in
several
of
his
former
pupils
artisans
and
young
men
of
modest
commercial
pursuits
assiduously
followed
these
courses
of
history
geography
physical
and
natural
science
and
for
an
hour
and
a
half
marc
installed
at
his
desk
spoke
on
very
clearly
contending
with
error
and
conveying
a
little
truth
to
the
minds
of
the
humble
but
all
the
time
frightful
grief
was
consuming
him
his
home
was
pillaged
destroyed
his
love
bewailed
the
lost
wife
whom
he
would
find
no
longer
overhead
in
the
room
once
warm
with
tender
love
and
now
so
cold
nevertheless
like
the
obscure
hero
he
was
he
bravely
pursued
his
work
book
iii
i
directly
the
court
of
cassation
started
on
its
inquiry
david
and
marc
meeting
one
evening
in
the
lehmanns
dark
little
shop
decided
that
it
would
be
best
to
abstain
from
all
agitation
and
remain
in
the
background
now
that
the
idea
of
a
revision
of
the
case
was
accepted
the
family
great
joy
and
hope
had
restored
its
courage
if
the
inquiry
should
be
loyally
conducted
by
the
court
simon
innocence
would
surely
be
recognised
and
acquittal
would
become
certain
so
it
would
suffice
to
remain
wakeful
and
watchful
of
the
march
of
the
affair
without
exhibiting
any
doubt
of
the
conscientiousness
and
equity
of
the
highest
judges
in
the
land
there
was
only
one
thing
which
prevented
the
joy
of
those
poor
people
from
becoming
perfect
the
news
of
simon
health
was
still
far
from
good
and
might
he
not
succumb
over
yonder
before
the
triumph
the
court
had
declared
that
there
were
no
grounds
for
bringing
him
back
to
france
before
its
final
judgment
and
it
seemed
likely
that
the
inquiry
might
last
several
months
in
spite
of
all
this
however
david
remained
full
of
superb
confidence
relying
on
the
wonderful
strength
of
resistance
which
his
brother
had
hitherto
displayed
he
knew
him
and
he
tranquillised
the
others
even
made
them
laugh
by
telling
stories
of
simon
youth
anecdotes
which
showed
him
retiring
within
himself
with
singular
force
of
will
thoughtful
both
of
his
dignity
and
of
the
happiness
of
those
near
to
him
so
the
interview
between
marc
david
and
the
lehmanns
ended
and
they
separated
resolved
to
show
neither
anxiety
nor
impatience
but
to
behave
as
if
the
victory
were
already
won
from
that
time
then
marc
shut
himself
up
in
his
school
attending
to
his
pupils
from
morn
till
night
giving
himself
to
them
with
an
abnegation
a
devotion
which
seemed
to
increase
in
the
midst
of
obstacles
and
suffering
while
he
was
busy
with
them
in
the
classroom
while
he
acted
as
their
big
brother
striving
to
apportion
the
bread
of
knowledge
among
them
he
forgot
some
of
his
torture
he
suffered
less
from
the
wound
in
his
heart
but
in
the
evenings
when
he
found
himself
alone
in
the
home
whence
love
had
fled
he
relapsed
into
frightful
despair
and
wondered
how
it
would
be
possible
for
him
to
continue
living
in
dark
and
chilly
widowerhood
some
little
relief
came
to
him
on
the
return
of
louise
from
mademoiselle
mazeline
and
yet
when
the
lamp
had
been
lighted
for
the
evening
meal
what
long
spells
of
silence
fell
between
the
father
and
the
daughter
each
plunged
into
inconsolable
wretchedness
by
the
departure
of
the
wife
the
mother
whose
desertion
haunted
them
they
tried
to
escape
from
their
pursuing
thoughts
by
talking
of
the
petty
incidents
of
the
day
but
everything
brought
them
back
to
her
they
ended
by
talking
of
her
alone
drawing
their
chairs
together
and
taking
each
other
hands
as
if
to
warm
each
other
in
their
solitude
and
all
their
evenings
ended
in
that
fashion
the
daughter
seated
on
her
father
lap
with
one
arm
around
his
neck
and
both
sobbing
and
quivering
beside
the
smoky
lamp
the
home
was
dead
the
absent
one
had
carried
away
its
life
its
warmth
its
light
yet
marc
did
nothing
to
compel
geneviève
to
return
to
him
indeed
he
did
not
wish
to
be
indebted
in
any
way
to
such
rights
as
it
might
be
possible
for
him
to
enforce
the
idea
of
a
scandal
a
public
dispute
was
odious
to
him
and
not
only
had
he
resolved
that
he
would
not
fall
into
the
trap
set
by
those
who
had
induced
geneviève
to
forsake
him
relying
in
this
connection
on
some
conjugal
drama
which
would
bring
about
his
revocation
but
he
also
set
all
his
hope
in
the
sole
force
of
love
geneviève
would
surely
reflect
and
return
home
in
particular
it
seemed
impossible
that
she
would
keep
her
expected
child
for
herself
alone
as
soon
as
possible
after
its
birth
she
would
bring
it
to
him
since
it
belonged
to
both
of
them
even
if
the
church
had
succeeded
in
perverting
her
as
a
loving
woman
surely
it
would
be
unable
to
kill
her
motherly
feelings
and
as
a
mother
she
would
come
back
and
remain
with
the
child
the
latter
birth
was
near
at
hand
so
there
would
not
be
more
than
a
month
to
wait
by
degrees
after
hoping
for
this
by
way
of
consoling
himself
marc
began
to
regard
it
as
a
certainty
and
like
a
good
fellow
who
did
not
wish
to
part
mother
and
daughter
he
sent
louise
to
spend
thursday
and
sunday
afternoons
with
geneviève
at
madame
duparque
although
that
dark
dank
pious
house
had
already
brought
him
so
much
suffering
perhaps
he
unknowingly
found
some
last
melancholy
satisfaction
in
this
indirect
intercourse
as
well
as
a
means
of
maintaining
a
tie
between
himself
and
the
absent
one
whenever
louise
came
home
after
spending
several
hours
with
her
mother
she
brought
a
little
of
geneviève
with
her
and
on
those
evenings
her
father
kept
her
longer
than
usual
on
his
knees
and
questioned
her
eagerly
longing
for
tidings
even
though
they
might
make
him
suffer
did
you
find
her
my
dear
he
would
ask
she
laugh
a
little
does
she
seem
pleased
did
she
play
with
you
no
father
you
know
very
well
that
she
has
long
ceased
to
play
but
she
still
had
a
little
gaiety
when
she
was
here
and
now
she
looks
sad
and
not
ill
enough
to
remain
in
bed
on
the
contrary
she
can
not
keep
from
moving
about
and
her
hands
are
burning
hot
as
if
she
had
the
fever
what
did
you
do
my
dear
went
to
vespers
as
we
do
every
sunday
then
we
returned
to
grandmamma
for
some
refreshment
there
was
a
monk
there
whom
i
did
not
know
some
missionary
who
told
us
stories
of
savages
then
marc
remained
silent
for
a
moment
full
of
great
bitterness
of
spirit
but
unwilling
to
judge
the
mother
in
the
daughter
presence
or
to
give
the
latter
an
order
to
disobey
her
by
refusing
to
accompany
her
to
church
at
last
he
resumed
gently
did
she
speak
to
you
of
me
my
dear
no
father
nobody
there
speaks
to
me
of
you
and
as
you
told
me
never
to
speak
first
about
you
it
is
just
as
if
you
did
not
exist
the
same
grandmother
is
not
angry
with
you
duparque
hardly
looks
at
me
and
i
prefer
that
for
she
has
such
eyes
that
she
frightens
me
when
she
scolds
but
grandmamma
berthereau
is
very
kind
especially
when
there
is
nobody
there
to
see
her
she
gives
me
sweets
and
takes
me
in
her
arms
and
kisses
me
ever
so
much
berthereau
yes
one
day
even
she
told
me
that
i
ought
to
love
you
very
much
she
is
the
only
one
who
has
ever
spoken
to
me
of
you
marc
again
relapsed
into
silence
for
he
did
not
wish
his
daughter
to
be
initiated
too
soon
into
the
wretchedness
of
life
he
had
always
suspected
that
the
doleful
silent
madame
berthereau
once
so
well
loved
by
her
husband
now
led
a
life
of
agony
beneath
the
bigoted
rule
of
her
mother
that
harsh
madame
duparque
and
he
felt
that
he
might
possibly
have
an
ally
in
the
younger
woman
though
unfortunately
one
whose
spirit
was
so
broken
that
she
might
never
find
the
courage
to
speak
or
act
must
be
very
affectionate
with
grandmamma
berthereau
said
marc
to
louise
by
way
of
conclusion
she
may
not
say
it
i
think
she
is
grieved
as
we
are
and
mind
you
kiss
your
mother
for
both
of
us
she
will
feel
that
i
have
joined
in
your
caress
father
thus
did
the
long
evening
pass
away
bitter
but
quiet
in
the
wrecked
home
whenever
on
a
sunday
the
daughter
returned
with
some
bad
tidings
speaking
for
instance
of
a
sick
headache
or
some
affection
of
the
nerves
from
which
the
mother
now
suffered
the
father
remained
full
of
anxiety
until
the
ensuing
thursday
that
nervous
affection
did
not
surprise
him
he
trembled
lest
his
poor
wife
should
be
consumed
in
the
perverse
and
imbecile
flames
of
mysticism
but
if
on
the
following
thursday
his
daughter
told
him
that
mamma
had
smiled
and
inquired
about
the
little
cat
she
had
left
at
home
he
revived
to
hope
and
laughed
with
satisfaction
and
relief
then
once
again
he
composed
himself
to
await
the
return
of
the
dear
absent
one
who
would
surely
come
back
with
her
babe
at
her
breast
since
geneviève
departure
mademoiselle
mazeline
by
the
force
of
things
had
become
a
an
intimate
for
marc
and
louise
she
brought
the
child
home
almost
every
evening
after
lessons
and
rendered
little
services
in
that
disorganised
home
where
there
was
no
longer
any
housewife
the
dwellings
of
the
schoolmaster
and
the
schoolmistress
almost
touched
one
another
there
was
only
a
little
yard
to
be
crossed
while
in
the
rear
a
gate
facilitated
communication
between
the
two
gardens
thus
the
intercourse
became
closer
particularly
as
marc
felt
great
sympathy
for
mademoiselle
mazeline
whom
he
regarded
as
a
most
courageous
and
excellent
woman
he
had
learnt
to
esteem
her
at
jonville
in
former
times
on
finding
that
she
was
quite
free
from
superstition
and
strove
to
endow
her
pupils
with
solid
minds
and
loving
hearts
and
now
at
maillebois
he
felt
intense
friendship
for
her
so
well
did
she
realise
his
ideal
of
the
educating
initiating
woman
the
only
one
capable
of
liberating
future
society
marc
was
now
thoroughly
convinced
that
no
serious
progress
would
ever
be
effected
if
woman
did
not
accompany
man
and
even
precede
him
on
the
road
to
the
happy
city
and
how
comforting
it
was
to
meet
at
least
one
of
those
pioneers
one
who
was
both
very
intelligent
and
very
all
simplicity
too
accomplishing
her
work
of
salvation
as
if
it
were
one
of
the
natural
functions
of
her
being
thus
mademoiselle
mazeline
became
for
marc
amid
his
torture
a
friend
prized
for
her
serenity
and
gaiety
one
who
imparted
consolation
and
hope
he
was
profoundly
touched
by
the
schoolmistress
sympathy
and
obligingness
she
frequently
spoke
of
geneviève
with
anxious
affection
devising
excuses
for
her
explaining
her
case
like
a
sensible
woman
who
regarded
lack
of
sense
in
others
with
sympathetic
compassion
and
she
particularly
begged
of
marc
that
he
would
not
be
violent
that
he
would
not
behave
like
an
egotistical
and
jealous
master
one
of
those
for
whom
a
wife
is
a
slave
a
thing
handed
over
to
them
by
the
laws
without
doubt
mademoiselle
mazeline
had
much
to
do
with
the
prudence
which
marc
evinced
in
striving
to
remain
patient
and
relying
on
sense
and
love
to
convince
geneviève
and
bring
her
back
to
him
finally
the
schoolmistress
endeavoured
with
so
much
delicacy
to
replace
the
absent
mother
with
louise
that
she
became
as
it
were
the
light
of
that
mournful
home
where
father
and
daughter
shivered
at
the
thought
of
their
abandonment
during
those
first
fine
days
of
the
year
mademoiselle
mazeline
frequently
found
herself
of
an
evening
with
marc
and
louise
in
their
little
garden
behind
the
school
the
schoolmistress
had
merely
to
open
the
gate
of
communication
whose
bolts
were
drawn
back
on
either
side
and
neighbourly
intercourse
followed
indeed
she
somewhat
neglected
her
own
garden
for
the
schoolmaster
where
a
table
and
a
few
chairs
were
set
out
under
some
lilac
bushes
they
jestingly
called
this
spot
wood
as
if
they
had
sought
shelter
under
some
large
oaks
on
a
patch
of
forest
land
then
the
scanty
lawn
was
likened
to
a
great
meadow
the
two
flower
borders
became
royal
and
after
the
hard
work
it
was
pleasant
indeed
to
chat
there
amid
the
quietude
of
twilight
one
evening
louise
who
had
been
reflecting
with
all
a
big
gravity
suddenly
inquired
why
have
you
never
married
at
this
the
schoolmistress
laughed
good
naturedly
my
darling
have
you
never
looked
at
me
she
answered
husband
is
not
easily
found
when
one
has
such
a
big
nose
as
mine
and
no
figure
the
girl
looked
at
her
mistress
with
astonishment
for
never
had
she
thought
her
ugly
true
enough
mademoiselle
mazeline
did
not
possess
a
fine
figure
and
her
nose
was
too
large
her
face
a
broad
one
with
a
bumpy
forehead
and
projecting
cheek
bones
but
her
admirable
eyes
smiled
so
tenderly
that
her
whole
countenance
became
resplendent
with
charm
are
very
pretty
declared
louise
in
a
tone
of
conviction
i
were
a
man
i
should
like
to
marry
you
marc
felt
very
much
amused
while
mademoiselle
mazeline
gave
signs
of
restrained
emotion
tinged
somewhat
with
melancholy
would
seem
that
the
men
have
the
same
taste
as
you
my
dear
said
she
as
she
recovered
her
quiet
gaiety
i
was
between
twenty
and
i
would
willingly
have
married
but
i
met
nobody
who
wished
for
me
and
i
should
not
think
of
marrying
now
when
i
am
six
and
thirty
not
marc
inquired
because
the
time
has
passed
an
humble
elementary
teacher
born
of
poor
parents
hardly
tempts
the
marrying
men
where
can
one
be
found
willing
to
burden
himself
with
a
wife
who
earns
little
who
is
tied
to
heavy
duties
and
compelled
to
live
in
the
depths
of
some
out
of
the
way
region
if
she
is
not
lucky
enough
to
marry
a
schoolmaster
and
share
her
poverty
with
his
she
inevitably
becomes
an
old
maid
i
long
since
gave
up
all
idea
of
marriage
and
i
am
happy
all
the
same
but
she
quickly
added
course
marriage
is
necessary
a
woman
ought
to
marry
for
she
does
not
live
she
does
not
fulfil
her
natural
destiny
unless
she
becomes
wife
and
mother
no
real
health
or
happiness
exists
for
any
human
creature
apart
from
his
or
her
complete
florescence
and
in
teaching
my
girls
i
never
forget
that
they
are
destined
to
have
husbands
and
children
some
day
only
when
one
is
forgotten
sacrificed
as
it
were
one
has
to
arrange
for
oneself
some
little
corner
of
content
thus
i
have
cut
out
for
myself
my
share
of
work
and
i
do
complain
so
much
for
in
spite
of
everything
i
have
succeeded
in
becoming
a
mother
all
the
children
of
others
all
the
dear
little
girls
with
whom
i
busy
myself
from
morning
till
evening
belong
to
me
i
am
not
alone
i
have
a
very
large
family
she
laughed
as
she
thus
referred
to
her
admirable
devotion
in
the
simple
way
of
one
who
seemed
to
feel
that
she
was
under
obligations
to
all
the
pupils
who
consented
to
become
the
children
of
her
mind
and
heart
said
marc
by
way
of
conclusion
life
shows
itself
harsh
to
any
of
us
the
disinherited
one
must
behave
kindly
to
life
that
is
the
only
way
to
prevent
misfortune
on
most
occasions
when
marc
and
mademoiselle
mazeline
met
in
the
little
garden
over
which
the
twilight
stole
their
talk
was
of
geneviève
this
was
particularly
the
case
on
those
evenings
when
louise
after
spending
the
afternoon
at
madame
duparque
returned
with
news
of
her
mother
one
day
she
came
back
in
a
state
of
much
emotion
for
her
mother
whom
she
had
accompanied
to
the
capuchin
chapel
to
witness
some
great
ceremony
in
honour
of
antony
of
padua
had
fainted
away
there
and
had
been
carried
to
madame
duparque
in
a
disquieting
condition
will
end
by
killing
her
cried
marc
despairingly
but
mademoiselle
mazeline
wishing
to
comfort
him
evinced
stubborn
optimism
no
when
all
is
said
your
geneviève
has
only
an
ailing
mind
she
is
physically
healthy
and
strong
some
day
you
see
my
friend
her
intelligence
helped
by
her
heart
will
win
the
victory
and
what
could
you
expect
she
is
paying
for
her
mystical
education
and
training
in
one
of
those
convents
whence
as
long
as
they
remain
unclosed
the
evils
which
assail
women
and
the
disasters
of
married
life
will
always
come
you
must
forgive
her
she
is
not
the
real
culprit
she
suffers
from
the
long
heredity
bequeathed
to
her
by
her
forerunners
possessed
terrorised
and
stupefied
by
the
church
overcome
by
sadness
marc
though
his
daughter
was
present
could
not
restrain
a
low
plaint
a
spontaneous
avowal
for
her
sake
and
mine
it
would
have
been
better
if
we
had
never
married
she
could
not
become
my
helpmate
my
other
self
whom
would
you
have
married
then
the
schoolmistress
inquired
would
you
have
found
a
girl
of
the
middle
class
who
had
not
been
brought
up
under
catholic
rule
possessed
with
error
and
falsehoods
the
wife
you
needed
my
poor
friend
with
your
free
mind
an
artisan
of
the
future
as
you
are
still
remains
to
be
created
perhaps
just
a
few
specimens
exist
but
even
they
are
tainted
by
atavism
and
faulty
education
then
with
a
laugh
she
added
in
her
gentle
yet
resolute
way
you
know
that
i
am
trying
to
form
such
companions
as
may
be
needed
by
the
men
who
have
freed
themselves
from
dogmas
and
who
thirst
for
truth
and
equity
yes
i
am
trying
to
provide
wives
for
the
young
fellows
whom
you
on
your
side
are
training
as
for
yourself
my
friend
you
were
merely
born
too
soon
thus
conversing
the
schoolmaster
and
the
schoolmistress
those
humble
pioneers
of
the
future
social
system
forgot
in
some
measure
the
presence
of
the
big
girl
of
thirteen
who
listened
to
them
in
silence
but
with
her
ears
wide
open
marc
had
discreetly
refrained
from
giving
any
direct
lessons
to
his
daughter
he
contented
himself
with
setting
her
an
example
and
she
loved
him
dearly
because
he
showed
so
much
goodness
of
heart
sincerity
and
equity
the
mind
of
that
big
girl
was
slowly
awakening
to
reason
but
she
did
not
dare
to
intervene
as
yet
in
the
conversation
of
her
father
and
mademoiselle
though
assuredly
she
derived
profit
from
it
even
if
like
other
children
when
their
elders
forget
themselves
so
far
as
to
speak
before
them
of
things
regarded
as
being
above
their
intelligence
she
appeared
neither
to
hear
nor
to
understand
with
her
glance
wandering
away
into
the
falling
night
her
lips
scarcely
stirred
by
a
faint
quiver
she
was
always
learning
classifying
in
her
little
head
all
the
ideas
that
emanated
from
those
two
persons
whom
with
her
mother
were
the
ones
she
loved
best
in
the
world
and
one
day
after
a
conversation
of
the
kind
a
remark
which
escaped
her
as
she
emerged
from
one
of
her
deep
reveries
showed
that
she
had
perfectly
understood
i
marry
said
she
shall
want
a
husband
whose
ideas
are
like
papa
so
that
we
may
discuss
things
and
come
to
an
agreement
and
if
we
both
think
alike
it
will
all
go
well
this
manner
of
resolving
the
problem
greatly
amused
mademoiselle
mazeline
marc
on
his
side
was
moved
for
he
felt
that
some
of
his
own
passion
for
truth
his
clear
firm
mind
was
appearing
in
his
daughter
doubtless
while
a
child
brain
is
yet
dimly
developing
it
is
difficult
to
foretell
what
will
be
the
woman
mature
intellect
yet
marc
thought
he
had
grounds
for
believing
that
louise
would
prove
sensible
and
healthy
free
from
many
errors
and
this
probability
was
very
sweet
to
him
as
if
indeed
he
awaited
from
his
daughter
the
help
the
loving
mediation
which
by
bringing
the
absent
one
back
to
the
home
would
all
the
ties
so
tragically
severed
however
the
news
which
louise
brought
from
the
place
des
capucins
grew
worse
and
worse
as
the
time
for
her
child
birth
drew
near
geneviève
became
more
and
more
gloomy
more
and
more
capricious
and
bad
tempered
in
such
wise
that
at
times
she
even
rejected
her
daughter
caresses
she
had
had
several
more
fainting
fits
and
was
giving
way
it
seemed
to
increasing
religious
exaltation
after
the
fashion
of
those
patients
who
disappointed
by
the
inefficacy
of
certain
drugs
double
and
double
the
dose
until
at
last
they
poison
themselves
thus
one
delightful
evening
while
mademoiselle
mazeline
sat
with
the
others
in
the
flowery
garden
the
news
which
louise
communicated
rendered
the
schoolmistress
so
anxious
that
she
made
a
proposal
to
marc
i
go
to
see
your
wife
my
friend
she
asked
showed
some
affection
for
me
in
former
times
and
perhaps
she
might
listen
to
me
if
i
were
to
talk
sense
to
her
what
would
you
say
to
her
marc
replied
that
her
place
is
beside
you
that
she
still
loves
you
though
she
knows
it
not
that
her
sufferings
are
all
due
to
a
frightful
misunderstanding
and
that
she
will
only
be
cured
when
she
returns
to
you
with
that
dear
child
the
thought
of
whom
is
stifling
her
like
remorse
tears
had
risen
to
the
eyes
of
marc
who
felt
quite
upset
by
the
schoolmistress
words
but
louise
quickly
intervened
no
mademoiselle
she
said
go
to
see
mamma
i
advise
you
not
to
not
my
darling
the
girl
blushed
and
became
greatly
embarrassed
she
knew
not
how
to
explain
in
what
contemptuous
and
hateful
terms
the
schoolmistress
was
spoken
of
at
the
little
house
on
the
place
des
capucins
but
mademoiselle
mazeline
understood
and
like
a
woman
accustomed
to
misrepresentation
she
gently
asked
your
mamma
no
longer
like
me
then
do
you
fear
she
might
receive
me
badly
mamma
does
not
say
much
louise
ended
by
confessing
is
the
others
then
marc
overcoming
his
emotion
resumed
child
is
right
my
friend
your
visit
might
become
painful
and
it
would
probably
have
no
effect
none
the
less
i
thank
you
for
your
kindness
i
know
how
warm
your
heart
is
a
long
spell
of
silence
ensued
the
sky
overhead
was
beautifully
clear
and
quietude
descended
from
the
vast
vault
of
azure
where
the
sun
was
expiring
in
a
roseate
flush
a
few
carnations
a
few
wallflowers
in
the
little
garden
borders
perfumed
the
mild
air
and
nothing
more
was
said
that
evening
by
marc
and
his
friend
as
they
lingered
steeped
in
melancholy
amid
the
delightful
close
of
a
fine
day
the
inevitable
had
duly
come
to
pass
a
week
had
not
elapsed
after
geneviève
departure
from
her
home
before
all
maillebois
was
talking
of
a
scandalous
intrigue
carried
on
publicly
by
the
schoolmaster
and
the
schoolmistress
in
the
daytime
it
was
said
they
constantly
left
their
classrooms
to
join
one
another
and
they
spent
their
evenings
together
in
the
garden
of
the
boys
school
where
they
could
be
plainly
distinguished
from
certain
neighbouring
windows
and
the
abominable
thing
was
the
constant
presence
of
little
louise
who
mingled
with
it
all
the
vilest
reports
speedily
began
to
circulate
pretended
that
they
had
heard
marc
and
mademoiselle
mazeline
singing
and
laughing
over
filthy
songs
then
a
legend
sprang
up
it
being
plainly
established
that
if
geneviève
had
quitted
her
home
it
was
in
a
spirit
of
legitimate
revolt
and
disgust
and
in
order
to
avoid
association
with
that
other
woman
that
godless
creature
who
depraved
the
little
girls
confided
to
her
care
thus
there
was
not
merely
a
question
of
restoring
louise
to
her
mother
in
order
to
save
the
children
of
maillebois
from
perdition
the
schoolmaster
and
the
schoolmistress
must
be
stoned
and
driven
away
some
of
these
rumours
reached
marc
ears
but
he
realising
by
their
imbecile
violence
whence
they
emanated
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
the
congregations
had
not
managed
to
secure
a
scandal
in
connection
with
geneviève
departure
they
were
resuming
their
underhand
work
of
slander
striving
to
embitter
the
new
state
of
things
they
had
failed
to
bring
about
marc
revocation
by
taking
his
wife
from
him
but
perhaps
they
might
succeed
by
accusing
him
of
keeping
a
mistress
moreover
this
would
cast
a
slur
on
the
secular
schools
and
was
dirty
work
well
suited
to
clerics
who
do
not
shrink
from
any
lies
to
ensure
the
triumph
of
religion
since
the
revival
of
the
simon
case
father
crabot
no
doubt
had
been
leading
a
cloistered
life
and
besides
he
seemed
to
occupy
too
high
a
position
to
stoop
to
such
abominable
inventions
but
all
the
cassocks
and
frocks
of
maillebois
were
astir
brothers
and
capuchins
ever
winging
their
flight
like
a
covey
of
black
gowns
over
the
road
to
valmarie
they
returned
looking
very
busy
and
then
in
all
the
confessional
boxes
of
the
region
in
quiet
corners
of
the
chapels
and
in
the
parlours
of
the
convents
came
endless
whispering
with
excited
female
devotees
who
grew
terribly
indignant
at
all
the
horrors
they
heard
thence
those
horrors
spread
in
undertones
and
hints
to
families
tradespeople
and
dependents
yet
if
marc
felt
angry
it
was
only
at
the
thought
that
ignoble
tales
were
surely
being
whispered
to
geneviève
herself
in
order
to
make
their
separation
irrevocable
a
month
elapsed
and
it
seemed
to
marc
that
the
birth
of
the
expected
child
must
be
imminent
after
counting
the
days
with
feverish
longing
he
felt
astonished
at
receiving
no
news
when
one
thursday
morning
pélagie
presented
herself
at
the
school
and
drily
requested
that
mademoiselle
louise
might
not
be
sent
to
see
her
mamma
that
afternoon
then
as
marc
recognising
her
voice
hastened
to
the
door
and
demanded
an
explanation
the
servant
ended
by
informing
him
that
accouchement
had
taken
place
on
the
monday
evening
and
that
she
was
not
at
all
in
a
favourable
state
of
health
that
said
pélagie
took
to
her
heels
feeling
worried
that
she
had
spoken
for
she
had
been
told
to
say
nothing
marc
on
his
side
remained
confounded
what
his
wife
relations
acted
as
if
he
did
not
exist
a
child
was
born
to
him
and
nobody
informed
him
of
it
and
such
rebellion
such
a
need
of
protest
arose
within
him
that
he
at
once
put
on
his
hat
and
repaired
to
the
ladies
house
when
pélagie
opened
the
door
she
almost
choked
thunderstruck
as
she
was
by
his
audacity
but
with
a
wave
of
the
arm
he
brushed
her
aside
and
without
a
word
walked
into
the
little
where
according
to
their
wont
madame
duparque
was
knitting
beside
the
window
while
madame
berthereau
seated
a
little
in
the
rear
slowly
continued
some
embroidery
the
little
room
which
smelt
as
usual
of
dampness
and
mouldiness
seemed
to
be
slumbering
amid
the
deep
silence
and
the
dismal
light
coming
from
the
square
but
the
grandmother
amazed
and
indignant
at
the
sight
of
marc
sprang
abruptly
to
her
feet
you
take
such
a
liberty
as
this
sir
what
do
you
want
why
have
you
come
here
she
cried
the
incredible
violence
of
this
greeting
when
marc
himself
was
swayed
by
such
legitimate
anger
restored
his
calmness
have
come
to
see
my
child
he
answered
was
i
not
warned
the
old
lady
who
had
remained
rigidly
erect
seemed
to
understand
on
her
side
also
that
passion
might
place
her
in
a
position
of
inferiority
had
no
reason
to
warn
you
she
replied
was
waiting
for
geneviève
to
request
me
to
do
so
she
did
not
ask
you
all
at
once
marc
fancied
that
he
understood
the
position
in
the
person
of
his
wife
the
church
had
not
only
striven
to
kill
the
loving
woman
it
had
wished
to
kill
the
mother
also
if
geneviève
on
the
eve
of
her
delivery
had
not
returned
to
him
in
accordance
with
his
hopes
if
she
had
hidden
herself
away
as
if
she
were
ashamed
the
reason
must
be
that
her
child
had
been
imputed
to
her
as
a
crime
in
order
to
keep
her
in
that
house
they
must
have
filled
her
mind
with
fear
and
horror
as
if
she
were
guilty
of
some
sin
for
which
she
would
never
obtain
absolution
unless
she
severed
every
tie
that
had
united
her
to
satan
the
baby
a
boy
marc
asked
a
boy
is
he
i
wish
to
see
and
kiss
him
is
no
longer
here
longer
here
he
was
baptised
yesterday
under
the
name
of
the
blessed
saint
clément
and
has
gone
away
to
be
nursed
that
is
a
crime
marc
cried
with
a
pang
of
grief
is
not
right
to
baptise
a
child
without
its
father
consent
or
to
send
it
away
abduct
it
in
that
fashion
what
geneviève
geneviève
who
nursed
louise
with
such
motherly
delight
is
not
to
nurse
her
little
clément
madame
duparque
still
fully
retaining
her
composure
gave
a
little
grunt
of
satisfaction
pleased
as
she
was
in
her
rancour
to
see
him
suffer
catholic
mother
she
answered
has
the
right
to
have
her
child
baptised
particularly
when
she
has
reason
to
suspect
that
its
salvation
may
be
imperilled
by
its
father
atheism
and
as
for
keeping
the
child
here
there
could
be
no
thought
of
such
a
thing
it
would
have
done
neither
the
child
itself
nor
anybody
any
good
things
were
indeed
such
as
marc
had
fancied
the
child
had
been
regarded
as
the
progeny
of
the
devil
its
birth
had
been
awaited
like
that
of
antichrist
and
it
had
been
necessary
to
baptise
it
and
send
it
away
with
all
speed
in
order
to
avert
the
greatest
misfortunes
later
it
might
be
taken
back
an
attempt
might
be
made
to
consecrate
it
to
the
deity
and
make
a
priest
of
it
in
order
to
appease
the
divine
anger
in
this
wise
the
pious
little
home
of
the
place
des
capucins
would
not
undergo
the
shame
of
sheltering
that
child
its
father
would
not
soil
the
house
by
coming
to
kiss
it
and
as
it
would
not
be
constantly
before
its
mother
eyes
the
latter
would
be
delivered
from
remorseful
thoughts
marc
however
having
by
an
effort
calmed
himself
exclaimed
firmly
wish
to
see
geneviève
with
equal
decision
madame
duparque
replied
can
not
see
her
wish
to
see
geneviève
he
repeated
is
she
upstairs
in
her
old
room
i
shall
know
how
to
find
her
he
was
already
walking
towards
the
door
when
the
grandmother
barred
his
passage
can
not
see
her
it
is
impossible
said
she
do
not
wish
to
kill
her
do
you
the
sight
of
you
would
give
her
the
most
terrible
shock
she
nearly
died
during
her
accouchement
for
two
days
past
she
has
been
pale
as
death
unable
to
speak
at
the
least
feverishness
she
loses
her
senses
the
child
had
to
be
taken
away
without
letting
her
see
it
ah
you
may
be
proud
of
your
work
heaven
chastises
all
whom
you
have
contaminated
then
marc
no
longer
restraining
himself
relieved
his
heart
in
low
and
quivering
words
evil
woman
you
have
grown
old
in
practising
the
dark
cruelty
of
your
deity
and
now
you
seek
to
annihilate
your
posterity
you
will
pursue
the
work
of
withering
your
race
as
long
as
it
retains
in
its
flesh
one
drop
of
blood
one
spark
of
human
kindness
ever
since
her
widowhood
you
have
banished
your
daughter
here
from
life
and
its
sweetness
you
have
deprived
her
of
even
the
strength
to
speak
and
complain
and
if
your
granddaughter
is
dying
upstairs
as
the
result
of
having
been
wrenched
from
her
husband
and
her
child
it
is
also
because
you
agreed
to
it
for
you
alone
served
as
the
instrument
of
the
abominable
authors
of
this
crime
ah
yes
my
poor
my
adored
geneviève
how
many
lies
how
many
frightful
impostures
were
needed
to
take
her
from
me
and
here
she
has
been
so
stupefied
so
perverted
by
black
bigotry
and
senseless
practices
that
she
is
no
longer
woman
nor
wife
nor
mother
her
husband
is
the
devil
whom
she
may
never
see
again
lest
she
should
fall
into
hell
her
babe
is
the
offspring
of
sin
and
she
would
be
in
peril
of
damnation
should
she
give
it
her
breast
well
listen
such
crimes
will
not
be
carried
out
to
the
very
end
life
always
regains
the
upper
hand
it
drives
away
the
darkness
and
its
delirious
nightmares
at
each
fresh
dawn
you
will
be
vanquished
i
am
convinced
of
it
and
i
even
feel
less
horror
than
pity
for
you
wretched
old
woman
that
you
are
without
either
mind
or
heart
madame
duparque
had
listened
preserving
her
usual
expression
of
haughty
severity
and
not
even
attempting
to
interrupt
that
all
she
now
inquired
am
aware
that
you
have
no
feelings
of
respect
as
you
deny
god
how
could
one
expect
you
to
show
any
deference
for
a
grandmother
white
hair
nevertheless
in
order
to
show
you
how
mistaken
you
are
in
accusing
me
of
cloistering
geneviève
i
will
let
you
pass
go
upstairs
to
her
kill
her
at
your
ease
you
alone
will
be
responsible
for
the
fearful
agony
into
which
the
sight
of
you
will
cast
her
as
she
finished
the
old
lady
moved
away
from
the
door
and
returning
to
her
seat
near
the
window
resumed
her
knitting
without
the
slightest
sign
of
emotion
such
as
might
have
made
another
hands
tremble
marc
on
his
side
for
a
moment
remained
motionless
bewildered
at
a
loss
what
to
do
was
it
possible
for
him
to
see
geneviève
talk
to
her
strive
to
convince
her
and
win
her
back
at
such
a
time
as
this
he
realised
how
inopportune
how
perilous
even
such
an
effort
would
be
so
without
a
word
of
adieu
he
slowly
went
towards
the
door
but
a
sudden
thought
made
him
turn
the
child
is
no
longer
here
give
me
the
address
of
the
nurse
he
said
madame
duparque
returned
no
answer
but
continued
to
manipulate
her
knitting
needles
with
her
long
withered
fingers
in
the
same
regular
fashion
as
before
wo
give
me
the
nurse
address
marc
repeated
there
came
a
fresh
pause
and
at
last
the
old
woman
ended
by
saying
is
not
my
business
to
give
it
you
go
and
ask
geneviève
for
it
since
your
idea
is
to
kill
the
poor
child
fury
then
overcame
marc
he
sprang
to
the
window
and
shouted
in
the
grandmother
impassive
face
must
give
me
the
nurse
address
this
moment
at
once
she
however
was
still
silently
braving
him
with
her
clear
eyes
fixed
upon
his
face
when
madame
berthereau
now
utterly
distracted
intervened
at
the
outset
of
the
dispute
she
had
stubbornly
kept
her
head
bent
over
her
embroidery
like
one
who
was
resigned
to
everything
who
had
become
cowardly
and
wished
to
avoid
compromising
herself
for
fear
of
great
personal
worries
but
when
marc
while
reproaching
madame
duparque
with
her
harsh
and
fanatical
tyranny
had
alluded
to
all
that
she
herself
had
suffered
since
her
widowhood
in
that
bigoted
home
she
had
yielded
to
increasing
emotion
to
the
tears
which
long
forced
back
again
rose
from
her
heart
and
almost
choked
her
she
forgot
some
of
her
silent
timidity
after
long
years
she
raised
her
head
once
more
and
became
impassioned
and
when
she
heard
her
mother
refuse
to
give
that
poor
robbed
tortured
man
the
address
of
his
child
nurse
she
at
last
rebelled
and
cried
the
address
aloud
nurse
is
a
madame
delorme
at
dherbecourt
near
valmarie
at
this
suddenly
roused
from
her
rigidity
madame
duparque
sprang
to
her
feet
with
the
nimbleness
of
a
young
woman
waving
her
arm
the
while
as
if
to
strike
down
the
audacious
creature
whom
she
still
treated
as
a
child
though
she
was
more
than
fifty
years
old
allowed
you
to
speak
my
girl
are
you
going
to
relapse
into
your
past
weakness
she
cried
years
of
penitence
powerless
to
efface
the
fault
of
a
wicked
marriage
take
care
sin
is
still
within
you
i
feel
it
is
so
in
spite
of
all
your
apparent
resignation
why
did
you
speak
without
my
orders
for
a
moment
madame
berthereau
who
still
quivered
with
love
and
pity
was
able
to
resist
spoke
said
she
my
heart
bleeds
and
protests
we
have
no
right
to
refuse
marc
the
nurse
address
yes
yes
what
we
have
done
is
abominable
quiet
cried
her
mother
furiously
say
that
it
was
abominable
to
separate
the
wife
from
the
husband
and
then
to
separate
the
child
from
both
never
would
berthereau
my
poor
dead
husband
who
loved
me
so
much
never
would
he
have
allowed
love
to
be
slain
like
that
had
he
been
alive
quiet
be
quiet
erect
looking
taller
than
ever
in
the
vigorous
leanness
of
her
three
and
seventy
years
the
old
woman
repeated
that
cry
in
such
an
imperious
voice
that
her
daughter
seized
with
terror
surrendered
and
again
bent
her
head
over
her
embroidery
and
heavy
silence
fell
while
she
shook
with
a
slight
convulsive
tremor
and
tears
coursed
slowly
down
her
withered
cheeks
which
so
many
other
tears
shed
secretly
had
ravaged
marc
had
been
thunderstruck
by
the
sudden
outburst
of
that
poignant
family
drama
the
existence
of
which
he
hitherto
had
merely
suspected
he
felt
intense
sympathy
for
that
sad
widow
who
for
more
than
ten
years
past
had
been
hebetated
crushed
down
by
maternal
despotism
exercised
in
the
name
of
a
jealous
and
revengeful
god
and
if
the
poor
woman
had
not
defended
his
geneviève
if
she
had
abandoned
her
and
him
to
the
dark
fury
of
the
terrible
grandmother
he
forgave
her
for
her
shuddering
cowardice
on
seeing
how
greatly
she
suffered
herself
but
madame
duparque
had
again
recovered
her
quiet
composure
see
sir
she
said
presence
here
brings
scandal
and
violence
everything
you
touch
becomes
corrupt
your
breath
suffices
to
taint
the
atmosphere
of
the
spot
where
you
are
here
is
my
daughter
who
had
never
ventured
to
raise
her
voice
against
me
but
as
soon
as
you
enter
the
house
she
lapses
into
disobedience
and
insult
go
sir
go
to
your
dirty
work
leave
honest
folk
alone
and
work
for
your
filthy
jew
though
he
will
end
by
rotting
where
he
is
it
is
i
who
predict
it
for
god
will
never
suffer
his
venerable
servants
to
be
defeated
in
spite
of
the
emotion
which
made
him
quiver
marc
could
not
refrain
from
smiling
as
he
heard
those
last
words
you
have
come
to
the
point
he
said
gently
affair
alone
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
is
it
not
so
and
it
is
the
friend
the
defender
of
simon
who
must
be
annihilated
by
dint
of
persecution
and
moral
torture
well
take
heed
of
this
make
no
mistake
sooner
or
later
truth
and
justice
will
win
the
victory
simon
will
some
day
leave
his
prison
and
the
real
culprits
the
liars
the
workers
of
darkness
and
death
will
some
day
be
swept
away
with
their
temples
whence
for
ages
past
they
have
terrorised
and
stupefied
mankind
then
turning
towards
madame
berthereau
who
had
sunk
once
more
into
silent
prostration
he
added
yet
more
gently
i
shall
wait
for
geneviève
tell
her
when
she
is
able
to
understand
you
that
i
am
waiting
for
her
i
shall
wait
as
long
as
she
is
not
restored
to
me
even
if
it
be
only
after
years
she
will
come
back
to
me
i
know
it
suffering
does
not
count
it
is
necessary
to
suffer
a
great
deal
to
win
the
day
and
to
enjoy
at
last
a
little
happiness
then
with
his
heart
lacerated
swollen
with
bitterness
yet
retaining
its
courage
he
withdrew
madame
duparque
had
resumed
her
everlasting
knitting
and
it
seemed
to
marc
that
the
little
house
he
quitted
sank
once
more
into
the
cold
gloom
which
came
to
it
from
the
neighbouring
church
a
month
slipped
away
mark
learnt
that
geneviève
was
slowly
recovering
one
sunday
pélagie
came
for
louise
who
in
the
evening
told
her
father
that
she
had
found
her
mother
looking
very
thin
and
broken
but
able
to
go
downstairs
and
seat
herself
at
table
with
the
others
in
the
little
fresh
hope
then
came
to
marc
the
hope
of
seeing
geneviève
return
to
him
as
soon
as
she
should
be
able
to
walk
from
the
place
des
capucins
to
the
school
assuredly
she
must
have
reflected
her
heart
must
have
awakened
during
her
sufferings
thus
he
started
at
the
slightest
sound
he
heard
imagining
it
was
she
but
the
weeks
went
by
and
the
invisible
hands
which
had
taken
her
from
him
were
doubtless
barricading
the
doors
and
windows
in
order
to
detain
her
yonder
he
then
sank
into
deep
sadness
though
without
losing
his
invincible
faith
his
conviction
that
he
would
yet
conquer
by
force
of
truth
and
love
he
found
consolation
during
those
dark
days
in
going
as
often
as
possible
to
see
his
little
son
clément
at
the
nurse
in
that
pretty
village
of
dherbecourt
which
looked
so
fresh
and
bright
amid
the
meadows
of
the
verpille
among
the
poplar
and
willow
trees
he
there
spent
a
delightfully
comforting
hour
hoping
perhaps
that
some
happy
chance
would
lead
to
a
meeting
with
geneviève
beside
the
dear
cradle
but
she
was
said
to
be
still
too
weak
to
go
to
see
her
son
whom
the
nurse
took
to
her
on
appointed
days
from
that
time
marc
remained
waiting
nearly
a
year
had
elapsed
since
the
court
of
cassation
had
begun
its
inquiry
which
had
been
retarded
by
all
sorts
of
complications
impeded
by
many
obstacles
which
were
incessantly
arising
thanks
to
the
subterranean
craft
of
the
evil
powers
at
the
lehmanns
house
after
the
keen
delight
which
had
welcomed
the
first
judgment
ordering
the
inquiry
despair
was
reappearing
now
that
things
moved
so
slowly
and
the
news
of
simon
was
so
bad
the
court
while
deeming
it
useless
to
have
him
brought
back
to
france
immediately
had
caused
him
to
be
informed
that
it
was
considering
the
revision
of
his
case
but
in
what
state
would
he
return
would
he
not
succumb
to
his
long
sufferings
before
that
constantly
adjourned
return
could
be
effected
even
david
who
was
so
firm
and
brave
now
felt
frightened
and
the
whole
region
suffered
from
that
long
wait
full
of
anguish
it
ravaged
maillebois
like
an
exhausting
crisis
the
prolongation
of
which
kept
all
social
life
in
suspense
and
it
began
to
turn
to
the
advantage
of
the
who
had
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
terrible
discovery
made
at
father
philibin
by
degrees
availing
themselves
of
the
slowness
of
the
proceedings
and
the
false
news
prompted
by
the
very
secrecy
of
the
inquiry
they
again
made
a
show
of
triumphing
and
prophesied
the
certain
and
crushing
overthrow
of
the
simonists
the
lies
and
insults
of
great
occasions
again
found
place
in
the
infamous
articles
of
petit
then
at
a
ceremony
in
honour
of
antony
of
padua
father
théodose
speaking
from
the
pulpit
ventured
to
allude
to
god
approaching
triumph
over
the
accursed
race
of
judas
brother
fulgence
also
was
again
seen
rushing
like
a
whirlwind
along
the
streets
and
across
the
squares
seemingly
very
busy
and
exultant
as
if
indeed
he
were
dragging
the
chariot
of
the
church
behind
him
in
some
triumphal
procession
as
for
brother
gorgias
whom
the
congregations
began
to
consider
a
very
compromising
personage
attempts
were
made
to
cloister
him
as
much
as
possible
though
his
friends
did
not
yet
dare
to
conjure
him
away
into
some
safe
retreat
like
father
philibin
in
this
matter
as
it
happened
brother
gorgias
was
not
an
easy
customer
to
deal
with
he
delighted
to
show
himself
and
astonish
people
by
playing
the
part
of
a
holy
man
who
negotiated
his
salvation
direct
with
heaven
on
two
occasions
he
created
a
scandal
by
boxing
the
ears
of
some
children
who
did
not
preserve
a
sufficiently
sanctimonious
demeanour
on
quitting
the
brothers
school
thus
mayor
philis
who
being
a
punctilious
formalist
was
scared
by
the
other
extraordinary
and
violent
piety
thought
it
his
duty
to
intervene
in
the
very
interests
of
religion
the
question
came
before
the
municipal
council
where
by
the
way
darras
still
in
a
minority
was
now
evincing
the
more
prudence
as
he
did
not
despair
of
becoming
mayor
again
with
a
larger
majority
than
formerly
should
the
simon
case
only
turn
out
well
meantime
he
avoided
all
occasions
of
speaking
of
it
keeping
his
lips
sealed
feeling
very
anxious
whenever
he
saw
the
monks
and
the
priests
again
taking
the
side
of
the
wall
in
maillebois
as
if
it
were
for
ever
their
conquered
possession
but
bad
though
the
news
might
be
marc
forced
himself
to
remain
hopeful
he
was
very
much
encouraged
by
the
brave
fidelity
of
his
assistant
mignot
who
each
day
took
a
larger
share
in
his
life
of
devotion
and
battle
a
singular
moral
phenomenon
had
manifested
itself
in
this
transformation
in
which
one
observed
the
slowly
increasing
influence
of
a
master
over
a
disciple
who
at
first
had
rebelled
then
had
been
won
back
and
gradually
absorbed
in
former
times
nobody
would
have
suspected
there
was
such
heroic
stuff
in
mignot
as
now
began
to
appear
in
the
affair
he
had
behaved
in
a
most
equivocal
manner
helping
on
the
charges
against
simon
and
particularly
endeavouring
to
avoid
everything
compromising
it
had
seemed
as
if
his
only
thoughts
were
of
his
own
advancement
neither
good
nor
bad
he
had
been
liable
at
that
time
to
turn
out
well
or
ill
according
to
circumstances
and
associates
and
marc
had
come
and
had
proved
to
be
the
man
of
intellect
and
will
who
was
to
decide
the
fate
of
that
conscience
embellish
it
and
raise
it
to
a
perception
of
truth
and
justice
the
lesson
shone
forth
luminous
and
positive
example
the
teaching
of
a
hero
sufficed
to
make
other
heroes
arise
from
among
the
vague
dim
masses
of
average
folk
on
two
occasions
during
the
last
ten
years
there
had
been
a
desire
to
appoint
mignot
as
in
a
neighbouring
little
village
but
he
had
declined
the
offer
preferring
to
remain
by
the
side
of
marc
whose
influence
over
him
had
become
so
great
that
he
spoke
of
never
leaving
him
of
remaining
to
the
end
his
faithful
disciple
resolutely
sharing
his
victory
or
defeat
in
the
same
way
after
postponing
in
a
spirit
of
expectant
prudence
the
question
whether
he
would
marry
or
not
he
had
decided
to
remain
a
bachelor
saying
that
it
was
too
late
for
him
to
seek
a
wife
and
that
his
pupils
had
now
become
his
family
besides
did
he
not
take
his
meals
at
marc
where
he
was
greeted
as
a
brother
making
that
home
his
own
and
enjoying
all
the
delights
of
the
nearest
ties
those
which
are
drawn
closer
and
closer
as
by
degrees
one
thinks
and
feels
the
same
as
one
fellow
thus
the
slow
sundering
of
marc
and
geneviève
had
proved
extremely
painful
to
mignot
and
since
geneviève
departure
he
was
in
despair
he
now
again
took
his
meals
at
a
neighbouring
eating
house
in
order
not
to
increase
the
embarrassment
of
that
stricken
home
where
no
housewife
was
left
but
he
gave
proof
of
respectful
affection
for
his
principal
and
endeavoured
to
console
him
if
he
did
not
join
him
and
keep
him
company
every
evening
after
dinner
it
was
from
a
delicate
feeling
of
discretion
an
unwillingness
to
obtrude
himself
when
marc
was
alone
with
his
daughter
he
held
back
also
when
mademoiselle
mazeline
was
there
feeling
that
she
would
prove
more
useful
to
the
forsaken
husband
more
expert
with
her
sisterly
hands
in
assuaging
the
pain
of
his
wounds
and
when
he
saw
marc
plunging
into
the
deepest
melancholy
ready
to
surrender
to
his
sufferings
he
as
yet
knew
of
only
one
way
of
bringing
joy
and
hope
to
his
face
again
which
was
to
reproach
himself
with
his
testimony
at
simon
former
trial
and
vow
that
at
the
coming
one
he
would
publicly
relieve
his
conscience
and
cry
the
truth
aloud
ah
yes
he
would
swear
that
simon
was
innocent
he
was
convinced
of
it
now
that
a
stream
of
light
had
illumined
his
memory
however
the
slow
progress
made
by
the
court
of
cassation
continued
to
encourage
the
in
their
desperate
campaign
and
the
onslaught
of
slander
directed
against
marc
became
fiercer
than
ever
one
morning
a
rumour
spread
through
maillebois
that
he
and
mademoiselle
mazeline
had
been
seen
under
circumstances
which
left
no
doubt
whatever
of
their
guilt
and
ignoble
particulars
were
given
the
inventions
evidently
of
overheated
pious
minds
at
the
same
time
the
story
remained
unreal
for
it
was
impossible
to
find
a
single
witness
and
different
versions
began
to
circulate
contradictory
in
character
though
tending
to
make
the
affair
appear
yet
more
horrible
it
was
mignot
who
feeling
very
anxious
ventured
to
warn
marc
of
the
gravity
of
the
scandal
and
this
time
it
was
not
sufficient
for
the
schoolmaster
to
meet
the
ignominious
charges
of
his
enemies
with
the
haughty
silence
of
disdain
he
spent
a
frightful
day
wrestling
with
his
feelings
his
heart
rent
by
the
fresh
sacrifice
which
his
work
demanded
of
him
when
twilight
came
however
he
had
made
up
his
mind
and
according
to
habit
he
repaired
to
the
little
garden
where
he
spent
such
a
pleasant
and
comforting
hour
every
evening
in
the
company
of
mademoiselle
mazeline
and
as
she
was
already
there
also
looking
very
thoughtful
and
sad
as
she
sat
under
the
lilac
bushes
he
took
a
seat
in
front
of
her
for
a
moment
he
looked
at
her
without
speaking
then
he
said
dear
friend
something
has
happened
which
grieves
me
very
much
and
i
wish
to
relieve
my
heart
before
louise
joins
us
we
can
not
continue
meeting
every
day
as
we
have
done
i
even
think
we
should
do
well
if
we
abstained
in
future
from
all
intercourse
it
is
a
question
of
real
farewell
it
is
necessary
we
should
part
my
friend
she
had
listened
without
giving
any
sign
of
surprise
it
was
as
if
she
had
known
beforehand
what
he
wished
to
say
indeed
in
a
sad
but
courageous
voice
she
answered
my
friend
it
was
for
that
very
farewell
that
i
came
here
this
evening
there
is
no
necessity
for
you
to
urge
me
to
it
for
like
you
i
feel
that
it
is
a
painful
necessity
somebody
has
told
me
everything
in
presence
of
such
infamy
our
only
weapons
are
abnegation
and
renouncement
a
long
interval
of
silence
fell
under
the
broad
calm
sky
where
the
daylight
was
slowly
dying
a
penetrating
odour
came
from
the
wallflowers
while
a
little
freshness
returned
to
the
grass
warmed
by
the
sunshine
and
marc
resumed
in
an
undertone
unfortunate
men
who
live
outside
the
pale
of
simple
nature
and
good
sense
can
in
no
wise
deal
with
man
and
woman
without
imputing
to
them
the
filth
harboured
by
their
own
minds
which
the
idea
of
sin
has
perverted
for
them
woman
is
but
a
whose
contact
corrupts
everything
tenderness
affection
friendship
i
i
had
foreseen
what
has
happened
but
i
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
it
all
unwilling
as
i
was
to
give
them
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
that
i
heeded
their
slanders
but
if
i
myself
can
afford
to
shrug
my
shoulders
there
is
the
question
of
you
my
friend
and
that
of
louise
who
so
i
heard
is
likewise
being
assailed
with
this
mud
thus
they
are
again
victorious
and
will
rejoice
at
having
added
another
great
grief
to
all
the
others
me
it
will
be
the
hardest
of
all
mademoiselle
mazeline
answered
with
much
emotion
shall
not
merely
lose
the
pleasure
of
our
evening
conversations
i
shall
have
the
sorrow
of
feeling
that
i
am
of
no
further
use
to
you
and
have
left
you
yet
more
lonely
and
unhappy
forgive
me
for
that
vain
thought
my
friend
but
it
made
me
so
happy
to
help
you
in
your
work
and
to
fancy
i
gave
you
some
comfort
and
support
and
now
i
shall
never
think
of
you
without
picturing
you
forsaken
alone
even
friendless
ah
there
are
certainly
some
very
detestable
people
in
the
world
marc
made
a
trembling
gesture
which
betrayed
his
grief
was
what
they
wished
to
do
said
he
they
wished
to
isolate
me
and
reduce
me
by
turning
every
affection
around
me
into
a
void
and
i
will
admit
to
you
that
this
is
the
only
wound
which
really
makes
me
suffer
all
the
rest
the
attacks
the
insults
the
threats
spur
me
on
intoxicate
me
with
a
desire
to
become
heroic
but
to
be
struck
in
the
person
of
those
who
belong
to
me
to
see
them
soiled
poisoned
cast
as
victims
among
the
cruelty
and
shame
of
the
struggle
that
is
a
frightful
thing
which
tortures
me
and
makes
me
cowardly
they
have
taken
my
poor
wife
now
they
are
separating
you
from
me
and
i
quite
expect
it
they
will
end
by
carrying
off
my
daughter
mademoiselle
mazeline
whose
eyes
were
filling
with
tears
endeavoured
to
silence
him
care
my
friend
she
said
is
louise
coming
but
he
quickly
retorted
need
not
take
care
i
was
waiting
for
her
she
must
be
told
what
has
been
decided
and
as
the
smiling
girl
came
forward
and
seated
herself
between
them
he
added
darling
in
a
moment
you
must
make
a
little
nosegay
for
mademoiselle
i
want
her
to
have
a
few
of
our
flowers
before
i
bolt
the
door
between
the
two
gardens
the
door
why
father
mademoiselle
must
not
come
here
again
our
friend
is
being
taken
from
us
as
your
mother
was
taken
louise
remained
thoughtful
and
grave
during
the
deep
silence
which
followed
after
looking
at
her
father
she
looked
at
mademoiselle
mazeline
but
she
asked
for
no
explanations
she
seemed
to
understand
all
sorts
of
precocious
thoughts
passed
like
faint
shadows
over
the
pure
and
lofty
brow
which
she
had
inherited
from
her
father
while
loving
distress
softened
her
eyes
will
go
and
make
the
nosegay
she
said
at
last
you
shall
give
it
to
mademoiselle
father
then
while
the
girl
went
seeking
the
freshest
flowers
along
the
borders
the
others
spent
a
few
sad
yet
sweet
minutes
together
they
no
longer
spoke
but
their
thoughts
mingled
in
brotherly
sisterly
fashion
thoughts
which
dwelt
only
on
the
happiness
of
others
the
reconciliation
of
the
sexes
the
education
and
liberation
of
woman
who
in
her
turn
would
liberate
man
and
this
was
human
solidarity
in
all
its
broadness
with
all
the
binding
and
absolute
ties
which
friendship
can
set
between
two
creatures
man
and
woman
apart
from
love
he
was
her
brother
she
was
his
sister
thus
did
they
ponder
and
the
night
which
was
falling
more
and
more
swiftly
over
the
balmy
garden
brought
them
a
restful
freshness
amid
their
sorrow
is
the
nosegay
father
said
louise
approaching
have
tied
it
with
a
bit
of
grass
then
mademoiselle
mazeline
stood
up
and
marc
gave
her
the
nosegay
all
three
next
went
towards
the
door
when
they
reached
it
they
remained
standing
there
still
saying
nothing
but
simply
feeling
happy
at
delaying
their
parting
for
a
moment
at
last
marc
set
the
door
wide
open
and
mademoiselle
mazeline
after
passing
into
her
own
garden
turned
round
and
for
the
last
time
looked
at
marc
whose
daughter
had
cast
her
arms
about
him
while
resting
her
head
against
his
shoulder
my
friend
my
friend
that
was
all
the
door
was
slowly
closed
and
on
either
side
the
bolts
were
gently
pushed
forward
but
they
had
become
rusty
and
raised
a
little
plaintive
cry
which
seemed
very
sad
everything
was
over
blind
hatred
had
slain
something
that
was
good
and
consoling
another
month
elapsed
marc
now
had
only
his
daughter
beside
him
and
he
felt
his
abandonment
and
solitude
increasing
louise
of
course
still
attended
mademoiselle
mazeline
school
and
under
the
inquisitive
eyes
of
the
girls
the
mistress
tried
to
evince
no
preference
for
her
but
to
treat
her
exactly
as
she
treated
the
others
the
child
no
longer
lingered
behind
after
but
hastened
home
to
prepare
her
lessons
beside
her
father
and
if
the
schoolmaster
and
the
schoolmistress
happened
to
meet
they
merely
bowed
to
each
other
refraining
from
any
exchange
of
words
apart
from
such
as
might
be
necessitated
by
their
duties
this
attitude
was
very
much
remarked
and
discussed
in
maillebois
reasonable
people
were
pleased
to
see
they
did
their
best
to
put
an
end
to
the
horrid
reports
which
had
been
circulated
but
the
others
sneered
saying
that
it
was
all
very
well
to
save
appearances
but
this
did
not
prevent
the
lovers
from
meeting
secretly
thus
infamous
reports
again
began
to
circulate
when
marc
heard
of
them
from
mignot
he
sank
into
bitter
discouragement
there
came
hours
when
his
courage
failing
he
asked
of
what
use
it
was
for
him
to
wreck
his
life
and
renounce
every
happiness
if
no
sacrifice
was
to
be
held
in
account
by
the
malicious
never
had
his
solitude
been
so
bitter
so
hard
to
bear
as
soon
as
at
nightfall
he
found
himself
alone
with
louise
in
the
cold
deserted
house
despair
came
over
him
at
the
thought
that
if
he
should
some
day
lose
his
child
nobody
would
be
left
to
love
him
and
warm
his
heart
the
girl
lighted
the
lamp
and
seated
herself
at
her
little
table
saying
i
am
going
to
write
my
history
exercise
before
i
go
to
bed
right
my
darling
work
he
answered
then
amid
the
deep
silence
of
the
empty
house
anguish
came
upon
him
he
could
no
longer
continue
correcting
his
pupils
exercises
but
rose
and
walked
heavily
up
and
down
the
room
in
this
wise
he
long
went
on
tramping
to
and
fro
in
the
gloom
beyond
the
circle
of
light
which
fell
from
the
and
at
times
as
he
passed
behind
his
daughter
he
leant
over
her
and
brusquely
kissed
her
hair
tears
gathering
the
while
in
his
eyes
what
is
the
matter
papa
asked
louise
are
distressing
yourself
again
a
hot
tear
had
fallen
on
her
brow
then
turning
round
she
took
hold
of
her
father
with
her
caressing
arms
and
compelled
him
to
sit
down
near
her
is
not
reasonable
of
you
papa
to
distress
yourself
like
that
when
we
are
alone
she
said
are
so
brave
in
the
daytime
but
one
would
think
you
felt
frightened
in
the
evening
just
as
i
used
to
do
when
i
did
not
like
to
remain
without
a
light
but
as
you
have
work
to
do
you
ought
to
work
he
tried
to
laugh
it
is
you
who
are
now
the
sensible
person
my
darling
said
he
you
are
right
certainly
i
will
get
to
work
again
then
however
as
he
continued
looking
at
her
his
eyes
again
clouded
and
he
once
more
began
to
kiss
her
hair
wildly
distractedly
is
the
matter
what
is
the
matter
she
stammered
deeply
stirred
and
in
her
turn
shedding
tears
do
you
kiss
me
like
that
papa
in
quivering
accents
he
then
confessed
his
terror
acknowledged
how
menacing
he
found
all
the
surrounding
gloom
if
at
least
you
remain
with
me
my
child
if
at
least
they
do
not
rob
me
of
you
as
well
she
could
find
no
answer
to
that
plaint
but
she
caressed
him
and
they
wept
together
at
last
having
succeeded
in
inducing
him
to
turn
to
his
pupils
exercises
she
herself
reverted
to
her
history
lesson
but
when
a
few
minutes
had
elapsed
anxiety
came
on
marc
again
he
was
compelled
to
rise
from
his
chair
and
walk
walk
without
a
pause
one
might
have
thought
he
was
pursuing
his
lost
happiness
athwart
all
the
silence
and
darkness
of
his
wrecked
home
louise
had
lately
completed
her
thirteenth
year
so
that
the
time
when
the
first
communion
is
usually
made
had
quite
come
and
all
the
devotees
of
maillebois
were
indignant
to
see
such
a
big
girl
remaining
religionless
refusing
to
go
to
confession
and
no
longer
even
attending
mass
and
naturally
she
was
compassionately
called
a
victim
crushed
down
beneath
the
brutal
authority
of
her
father
who
by
way
of
sacrilege
it
was
said
made
her
spit
on
the
crucifix
every
morning
and
evening
moreover
mademoiselle
mazeline
assuredly
gave
her
lessons
of
diabolical
depravity
but
was
it
not
a
crime
to
leave
that
poor
girl
soul
in
a
state
of
perdition
in
the
power
of
two
of
the
damned
whose
notorious
misconduct
horrified
every
conscience
thus
there
was
talk
of
energetic
action
of
organising
demonstrations
to
compel
that
unnatural
father
to
restore
the
daughter
to
her
mother
the
pious
woman
whom
he
had
driven
away
by
the
loathsome
baseness
of
his
life
accustomed
as
marc
was
to
insults
he
only
felt
anxious
when
he
thought
of
the
violent
scenes
to
which
louise
must
be
subjected
at
the
house
her
mother
still
in
an
ailing
state
was
content
to
treat
her
coldly
with
silent
sadness
leaving
madame
duparque
to
thunder
in
the
name
of
her
angry
deity
and
quicken
the
infernal
flames
under
satan
cauldrons
ought
not
a
big
girl
already
in
her
fourteenth
year
to
feel
ashamed
of
living
like
a
savage
like
one
of
those
dogs
who
know
nothing
of
religion
and
are
driven
from
the
churches
was
she
not
frightened
by
the
thought
of
the
eternal
chastisement
which
would
fall
on
her
the
boiling
oil
the
iron
forks
the
red
hot
hooks
the
prospect
of
being
lacerated
boiled
and
roasted
during
thousands
after
thousands
of
centuries
when
louise
on
returning
home
in
the
evening
told
marc
of
those
threats
he
shuddered
to
think
that
such
attempts
should
be
made
to
capture
her
conscience
by
fright
and
tried
to
read
her
eyes
in
order
to
ascertain
if
she
were
shaken
she
at
times
seemed
moved
but
then
things
which
were
really
too
abominable
were
told
her
and
in
her
quiet
sensible
way
she
would
remark
is
really
droll
papa
that
the
good
god
should
be
so
spiteful
grandmamma
said
that
if
i
once
missed
going
to
mass
the
devil
would
cut
my
feet
into
little
pieces
through
all
eternity
it
would
be
very
unjust
besides
it
seems
to
me
hardly
possible
after
such
remarks
her
father
felt
a
little
easier
in
mind
unwilling
as
he
was
to
do
any
violence
to
his
daughter
growing
intelligence
he
entered
into
no
direct
discussion
of
the
strange
lessons
which
she
received
at
the
ladies
house
he
contented
himself
with
some
general
teaching
based
on
reason
and
appealing
to
the
child
sense
of
truth
justice
and
kindness
he
was
delighted
by
the
precocious
wakening
of
good
sense
which
he
noticed
in
her
a
craving
for
logic
and
certainty
which
she
must
have
inherited
from
him
it
was
with
joy
that
he
saw
a
woman
with
a
clear
strong
mind
and
a
tender
heart
already
emerging
from
the
weak
girl
who
still
retained
in
many
respects
the
childishness
of
her
years
and
if
he
felt
anxious
it
was
from
a
fear
lest
the
promise
of
a
beautiful
harvest
should
be
destroyed
he
only
recovered
his
calmness
when
the
girl
astonished
him
by
reasoning
things
as
if
she
were
already
a
grown
woman
full
of
sense
i
am
very
polite
you
know
with
grandmamma
she
said
one
day
tell
her
that
if
i
do
not
go
to
confession
or
make
my
first
communion
it
is
because
i
am
waiting
till
i
am
twenty
years
old
as
you
asked
me
to
do
that
seems
to
me
very
reasonable
and
by
keeping
to
that
i
am
very
strong
for
when
one
has
reason
on
one
side
one
is
always
very
strong
is
it
not
so
at
times
too
in
spite
of
her
affection
and
deference
for
her
mother
she
said
with
a
smile
in
a
gentle
jesting
way
remember
papa
that
mamma
said
she
would
explain
the
catechism
to
me
and
i
answered
her
yes
mamma
you
shall
hear
me
my
lessons
you
know
that
i
try
my
best
to
understand
well
as
i
never
understood
anything
at
the
catechism
class
mamma
wished
to
explain
matters
to
me
but
unfortunately
i
still
understand
nothing
whatever
of
it
it
puts
me
into
great
embarrassment
i
feel
afraid
i
may
grieve
her
and
all
i
can
do
is
to
pretend
that
i
suddenly
understand
something
but
i
must
look
very
stupid
for
she
always
interrupts
the
lesson
as
if
she
were
angry
and
calls
me
foolish
the
other
day
when
she
was
talking
of
the
mystery
of
the
incarnation
she
repeated
that
it
was
not
a
question
of
understanding
but
of
believing
and
as
i
unluckily
told
her
that
i
could
not
believe
without
understanding
she
said
that
was
one
of
your
phrases
papa
and
that
the
devil
would
take
both
of
us
oh
i
cried
i
cried
she
smiled
however
as
she
spoke
of
it
and
added
in
a
lower
tone
of
making
me
think
more
as
mamma
does
the
catechism
has
rather
taken
me
away
from
her
ideas
there
are
too
many
things
in
it
that
worry
my
mind
it
is
wrong
of
mamma
to
try
to
force
them
into
my
head
her
father
could
have
kissed
her
was
he
to
have
the
joy
of
finding
in
his
daughter
an
exception
one
of
those
little
minds
that
ripen
early
in
which
sense
seems
to
grow
as
in
some
propitious
soil
other
girls
at
that
troublous
hour
of
maidenhood
are
still
so
childish
and
so
greatly
disturbed
by
the
quiver
which
comes
upon
them
that
they
easily
fall
a
prey
to
fairy
tales
and
mystical
reveries
how
rare
would
be
his
luck
if
his
own
girl
should
escape
the
fate
of
her
companions
whom
the
church
seized
and
conquered
at
a
disturbing
hour
of
life
tall
strong
and
very
healthy
she
was
already
a
young
woman
though
there
were
days
when
she
became
quite
childish
once
more
amusing
herself
with
trifles
saying
silly
things
returning
to
her
doll
with
which
she
held
extraordinary
conversations
and
on
those
days
anxiety
came
back
to
her
father
he
trembled
as
he
observed
that
there
was
still
so
much
puerility
in
her
nature
and
wondered
if
the
others
might
not
yet
steal
her
from
him
and
end
by
obscuring
her
mind
whose
dawn
was
so
limpid
and
so
fresh
yes
papa
what
my
doll
said
just
now
was
very
silly
but
what
can
you
expect
she
not
very
sensible
yet
do
you
hope
to
make
her
sensible
my
darling
scarcely
know
her
head
is
so
hard
with
bible
history
she
does
fairly
well
she
can
recite
that
by
heart
but
with
grammar
and
arithmetic
she
is
a
real
blockhead
then
she
laughed
that
sorry
home
might
be
empty
and
icy
cold
she
none
the
less
filled
it
with
childish
gaiety
as
sonorous
as
but
the
days
went
by
and
with
the
lapse
of
time
louise
became
more
serious
and
thoughtful
on
returning
from
her
thursday
and
sunday
visits
to
her
mother
she
sank
into
long
silent
reveries
of
an
evening
while
she
was
working
beside
the
lamp
she
paused
at
times
to
give
her
father
a
long
look
full
of
sorrowful
affection
and
at
last
came
that
which
was
bound
to
come
it
was
a
warm
evening
and
a
storm
was
threatening
the
heavens
were
heavy
with
a
mass
of
inky
clouds
the
father
and
the
daughter
according
to
their
habit
sat
working
in
the
little
circular
patch
of
light
which
fell
from
the
and
through
the
window
set
wide
open
upon
the
dark
and
slumbering
town
some
moths
flew
in
they
alone
disturbing
the
profound
silence
with
the
slight
quiver
of
their
wings
louise
who
had
spent
the
afternoon
at
the
house
on
the
place
des
capucins
seemed
very
tired
it
was
as
if
her
brow
was
laden
with
some
weighty
thought
leaning
over
her
exercise
paper
she
ceased
writing
and
reflected
and
at
last
making
up
her
mind
to
set
down
her
pen
she
spoke
out
amid
the
deep
mournful
quietude
of
the
house
i
want
to
tell
you
something
which
grieves
me
very
much
i
shall
certainly
cause
you
very
great
great
sorrow
and
that
is
why
i
did
not
have
the
courage
to
tell
you
of
it
before
but
i
have
made
up
my
mind
now
not
to
go
to
bed
before
telling
you
of
what
i
want
to
do
for
it
seems
to
me
so
reasonable
and
necessary
marc
had
immediately
looked
up
a
pang
a
feeling
of
terror
coming
to
his
heart
for
by
the
girl
tremulous
voice
he
guessed
that
the
supreme
disaster
was
at
hand
is
it
my
darling
he
asked
papa
i
have
been
turning
the
matter
over
in
my
head
all
day
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
think
as
i
do
i
ought
to
go
and
live
with
mamma
at
grandmother
marc
thoroughly
upset
began
by
protesting
violently
think
as
you
do
no
no
i
wo
allow
it
i
mean
to
keep
you
here
i
will
prevent
you
from
forsaking
me
papa
she
murmured
distressfully
it
over
only
just
a
little
and
you
will
see
that
i
am
right
but
he
did
not
listen
he
had
risen
and
was
walking
wildly
about
the
dim
room
have
only
you
left
me
and
you
think
of
going
away
my
wife
has
been
taken
from
me
and
now
my
daughter
is
to
be
taken
and
i
am
to
remain
alone
stripped
forsaken
without
an
affection
left
ah
i
felt
that
this
de
was
coming
i
foresaw
that
those
abominable
hands
working
in
the
darkness
would
tear
away
the
last
shred
of
my
heart
but
no
no
this
is
too
much
never
will
i
consent
to
such
a
separation
and
stopping
short
before
his
daughter
he
continued
roughly
you
also
had
your
mind
and
heart
spoilt
that
you
no
longer
love
me
at
each
of
your
visits
to
your
grandmother
i
am
put
on
trial
is
it
not
so
and
infamous
things
are
said
about
me
in
order
to
detach
you
from
me
it
is
a
question
eh
of
saving
you
from
the
damned
and
restoring
you
to
the
good
friends
of
those
ladies
who
will
turn
you
into
a
hypocrite
and
a
lunatic
and
you
listen
to
my
enemies
and
yield
to
their
constant
obsession
by
forsaking
me
louise
in
despair
her
eyes
full
of
tears
raised
her
hands
entreatingly
papa
calm
yourself
she
cried
assure
you
that
you
are
mistaken
mamma
has
never
allowed
anything
evil
to
be
said
about
you
before
me
grandmother
no
doubt
does
not
like
you
and
she
would
often
do
well
to
keep
quiet
when
i
am
there
it
would
be
telling
a
falsehood
to
say
that
she
does
not
do
all
she
can
to
get
me
to
join
mamma
and
live
with
her
but
i
swear
to
you
that
neither
she
nor
any
of
the
others
has
anything
to
do
with
what
i
propose
you
know
very
well
that
i
never
tell
you
stories
it
is
i
myself
who
have
thought
it
all
over
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
our
separation
would
be
a
good
and
sensible
thing
good
thing
that
you
should
forsake
me
why
it
would
kill
me
you
will
understand
and
you
are
so
brave
sit
down
and
listen
to
me
she
gently
compelled
him
to
seat
himself
again
in
front
of
her
and
taking
his
hands
in
hers
caressingly
she
reasoned
with
him
like
a
shrewd
little
woman
at
grandmother
said
she
convinced
that
you
alone
turn
me
away
from
religion
you
weigh
on
me
it
is
said
you
impose
your
ideas
on
me
and
if
i
could
only
escape
from
you
i
should
go
to
confession
and
make
my
first
communion
so
why
should
i
not
prove
to
them
that
they
are
mistaken
i
will
go
and
live
at
grandmother
and
then
they
will
see
for
themselves
they
will
have
to
admit
how
mistaken
they
have
been
for
nothing
will
prevent
me
from
giving
them
always
the
same
answer
i
have
promised
not
to
make
my
first
communion
before
i
am
twenty
in
order
that
the
full
responsibility
of
such
an
action
may
be
mine
only
and
i
shall
keep
my
promise
i
shall
wait
marc
made
a
gesture
of
doubt
poor
child
said
he
do
know
them
they
will
have
broken
down
your
resistance
and
have
conquered
you
in
a
few
weeks
time
you
are
still
only
a
little
girl
in
her
turn
louise
rebelled
it
is
not
nice
of
you
papa
to
think
there
is
so
little
seriousness
in
me
i
am
a
little
girl
it
is
true
but
your
little
girl
and
proud
of
it
she
spoke
those
words
with
such
childish
bravery
that
he
could
not
help
smiling
that
darling
daughter
in
whom
he
every
now
and
again
recognised
himself
in
whom
he
found
thoughtfulness
and
logic
blended
with
passionate
earnestness
warmed
his
heart
he
looked
at
her
and
found
her
very
pretty
and
very
sensible
with
a
face
which
was
both
firm
and
proud
and
bright
eyes
whose
frankness
was
admirable
and
he
continued
listening
while
she
keeping
his
hands
in
her
own
set
forth
the
reasons
which
prompted
her
to
join
her
mother
in
the
devout
little
house
of
the
place
des
capucins
without
any
reference
to
the
frightful
slanders
which
were
current
she
let
him
understand
that
it
would
be
well
for
them
not
to
brave
public
opinion
as
people
said
on
all
sides
that
her
right
place
was
at
the
ladies
house
she
was
willing
to
repair
thither
and
though
she
was
only
thirteen
years
of
age
she
would
certainly
be
its
most
sensible
inmate
folk
would
see
if
the
work
she
did
there
did
not
prove
the
best
matter
my
child
marc
said
at
last
with
an
air
of
great
lassitude
will
never
convince
me
of
the
necessity
of
a
rupture
between
you
and
me
she
felt
that
he
was
weakening
it
is
not
a
rupture
papa
she
exclaimed
have
gone
to
see
mamma
twice
a
week
and
i
shall
come
to
see
you
more
often
than
that
too
besides
do
you
understand
perhaps
mamma
will
listen
to
me
a
little
when
i
am
beside
her
i
shall
speak
to
her
of
you
i
shall
tell
her
how
much
you
still
love
her
how
you
weep
for
her
and
who
knows
she
will
reflect
and
perhaps
i
shall
bring
her
back
to
you
then
the
tears
of
both
began
to
flow
they
gave
way
to
their
emotion
in
each
other
arms
the
father
was
upset
by
the
deep
charm
of
that
daughter
in
whom
so
much
puerility
still
mingled
with
so
much
sense
goodness
and
hopefulness
and
the
girl
yielded
to
her
heart
like
one
ripened
before
her
time
by
things
of
which
she
was
vaguely
conscious
but
which
she
would
have
been
unable
to
explain
then
as
you
please
marc
ended
by
stammering
amid
his
tears
if
i
yield
do
think
that
i
approve
for
my
whole
being
rebels
and
protests
that
was
the
last
evening
they
spent
together
the
warm
night
remained
of
an
inky
blackness
there
seemed
to
be
not
a
breath
of
air
and
not
a
sound
came
through
the
open
window
from
the
resting
town
only
the
silent
moths
flew
in
scorching
themselves
by
contact
with
the
lamp
the
storm
did
not
burst
and
until
very
late
the
father
and
the
daughter
speaking
no
further
remained
one
in
front
of
the
other
seated
at
their
table
as
if
busy
with
their
work
but
simply
happy
at
being
together
yet
a
little
longer
amid
the
peaceful
quietude
how
frightful
however
did
the
following
evening
prove
for
marc
his
daughter
had
left
him
and
he
was
absolutely
alone
in
that
empty
and
dismal
dwelling
after
the
wife
the
child
he
had
nobody
to
love
him
now
all
his
heart
had
been
torn
from
him
bit
by
bit
moreover
in
order
that
he
might
not
even
have
the
consolation
of
friendship
he
had
been
compelled
by
base
slanders
to
cease
all
intercourse
with
the
one
woman
whose
lofty
sisterly
mind
might
have
sustained
him
the
complete
wrecking
of
his
life
of
the
approach
of
which
he
had
long
been
conscious
was
now
effected
the
stealthy
work
of
destruction
performed
by
hateful
invisible
hands
bent
on
undermining
him
and
throwing
him
down
on
the
ruins
of
his
own
work
was
accomplished
and
now
no
doubt
the
others
believed
they
held
him
bleeding
from
a
hundred
wounds
tortured
and
forsaken
strengthless
in
his
blasted
dwelling
that
soiled
and
deserted
home
where
he
was
left
in
agony
and
indeed
on
that
first
evening
of
solitude
he
was
really
a
beaten
man
and
his
enemies
might
well
have
thought
him
at
their
mercy
had
they
been
able
to
see
him
coming
and
going
in
the
pale
twilight
with
a
staggering
gait
like
some
wretched
stricken
beast
seeking
a
shadowy
nook
there
to
lie
down
and
die
the
times
were
in
truth
frightful
the
worst
possible
news
was
current
respecting
the
inquiry
of
the
court
of
cassation
whose
slowness
seemed
to
hide
a
desire
to
bury
the
affair
in
vain
had
marc
hitherto
compelled
himself
to
hope
each
day
his
dread
increased
lest
he
should
hear
of
simon
death
before
the
revision
of
the
case
should
be
an
accomplished
fact
during
that
mournful
time
he
pictured
everything
as
lost
revision
rejected
his
long
efforts
proving
useless
truth
and
justice
finally
slain
an
execrable
social
crime
a
shameful
catastrophe
which
would
engulf
the
whole
country
the
thought
of
it
filled
him
with
a
kind
of
pious
horror
sent
a
chilling
shudder
of
dread
through
his
veins
and
besides
that
public
disaster
there
was
the
disaster
of
his
own
life
which
weighed
upon
him
more
and
more
now
that
louise
was
no
longer
there
moving
his
heart
with
her
charming
ways
inspiriting
him
with
her
precocious
sense
and
courage
he
asked
himself
how
he
could
have
been
mad
enough
to
let
her
go
to
the
house
she
was
but
a
child
she
would
be
conquered
in
a
few
weeks
by
the
church
which
for
ages
past
had
been
victorious
over
woman
she
had
been
taken
from
him
she
would
never
be
restored
to
him
indeed
he
would
never
see
her
more
and
it
was
he
who
had
sent
that
still
defenceless
victim
to
error
his
work
he
himself
and
those
who
belonged
to
him
were
all
annihilated
and
at
the
thought
of
it
he
sank
into
heartrending
despair
eight
struck
and
marc
had
not
yet
found
the
strength
to
seat
himself
and
dine
alone
in
that
room
which
now
had
become
quite
dim
when
he
heard
a
timid
knock
at
the
door
and
great
was
his
astonishment
when
in
came
mignot
who
at
first
found
it
difficult
to
explain
himself
see
monsieur
froment
he
began
you
announced
to
me
this
morning
the
departure
of
your
little
louise
an
idea
came
to
me
and
i
been
turning
it
over
in
my
mind
all
day
so
this
evening
before
going
to
dine
at
the
eating
house
he
paused
seeking
his
words
have
you
dined
yet
mignot
marc
exclaimed
no
monsieur
froment
you
see
my
idea
was
to
come
and
dine
with
you
to
keep
you
company
a
little
but
i
hesitated
and
lost
time
if
it
would
please
you
however
now
that
you
are
alone
i
might
board
with
you
again
two
men
can
always
agree
we
could
do
the
cooking
and
surely
get
through
the
housework
together
are
you
agreeable
it
would
please
me
very
much
a
little
joy
had
returned
to
marc
heart
and
with
a
smile
tinged
with
emotion
he
replied
am
quite
willing
you
are
a
good
fellow
mignot
there
sit
down
we
will
begin
by
dining
together
and
they
dined
face
to
face
the
master
relapsing
the
while
into
his
bitterness
of
spirit
the
assistant
rising
every
now
and
then
very
quietly
to
fetch
a
plate
or
a
piece
of
bread
amid
the
melancholy
calm
of
evening
ii
then
during
the
months
and
months
that
the
inquiry
of
the
court
of
cassation
lasted
marc
again
had
to
shut
himself
up
in
his
school
and
devote
himself
body
and
soul
to
his
task
of
instructing
the
humble
and
rendering
them
more
capable
of
truth
and
justice
among
the
hopes
and
the
despairs
which
continued
to
enfever
him
according
as
the
news
he
heard
proved
good
or
bad
there
was
one
thought
that
haunted
him
more
and
more
long
previously
at
the
very
outset
of
the
affair
he
had
wondered
why
france
all
france
did
not
rise
to
exact
the
release
of
the
innocent
prisoner
one
of
his
dearest
illusions
had
been
his
belief
in
a
generous
france
a
magnanimous
and
just
france
which
many
times
already
had
passionately
espoused
the
cause
of
equity
and
which
would
surely
prove
its
goodness
of
heart
yet
once
again
by
striving
its
utmost
to
repair
the
most
execrable
of
judicial
errors
and
the
painful
surprise
he
had
experienced
on
finding
the
country
so
stolid
and
indifferent
after
the
trial
at
beaumont
now
increased
daily
became
more
and
more
torturing
for
in
the
earlier
stages
of
the
affair
he
had
been
able
to
excuse
it
realising
that
people
were
ignorant
of
the
true
facts
and
poisoned
with
lies
but
now
when
so
much
light
had
been
cast
on
the
affair
so
much
truth
made
manifest
he
could
find
no
possible
explanation
for
such
prolonged
and
such
shameful
slumber
in
iniquity
had
france
been
changed
then
was
it
no
longer
the
liberator
since
it
now
knew
the
truth
why
did
it
not
rise
instead
of
remaining
an
obstacle
a
blind
deaf
multitude
barring
the
road
and
marc
always
returned
in
thought
to
his
when
the
necessity
of
his
humble
work
as
a
schoolmaster
had
become
apparent
to
him
if
france
still
slept
the
heavy
sleep
of
conscienceless
matter
it
was
because
france
did
not
yet
know
enough
a
shudder
came
upon
him
how
many
generations
how
many
centuries
would
be
needed
for
a
people
nourished
with
truth
to
become
capable
of
equity
for
nearly
fifteen
years
he
had
been
endeavouring
to
train
up
just
men
a
generation
had
already
passed
through
his
hands
and
he
asked
himself
what
was
really
the
progress
that
had
been
effected
whenever
he
met
any
of
his
old
pupils
he
chatted
with
them
and
compared
them
both
with
their
parents
who
were
less
freed
from
the
original
clay
and
with
the
boys
who
nowadays
attended
his
school
and
whom
he
hoped
to
free
yet
more
than
their
forerunners
therein
lay
his
great
task
the
mission
he
had
undertaken
at
a
decisive
hour
of
his
life
and
prosecuted
throughout
all
his
sufferings
doubting
its
efficacy
in
occasional
moments
of
weariness
but
on
the
morrow
always
taking
it
up
again
with
renewed
faith
one
bright
august
evening
having
strolled
along
the
road
to
valmarie
as
far
as
bongard
farm
marc
perceived
fernand
his
former
pupil
who
was
returning
home
with
a
scythe
on
his
shoulder
fernand
had
lately
married
lucile
the
daughter
of
doloir
the
mason
he
now
being
and
she
nineteen
years
of
age
they
had
long
been
friends
having
played
together
in
the
old
days
on
leaving
school
and
that
evening
the
young
wife
a
little
blonde
with
a
gentle
smiling
demeanour
was
also
there
seated
in
the
yard
and
mending
some
linen
fernand
are
you
satisfied
is
there
a
good
crop
of
wheat
this
year
marc
inquired
fernand
still
had
a
heavy
face
with
a
hard
and
narrow
brow
and
his
words
came
slowly
as
in
his
childish
days
monsieur
froment
he
replied
can
never
be
satisfied
there
too
much
worry
with
this
wretched
land
it
takes
more
than
it
gives
as
his
father
though
barely
fifty
years
of
age
was
already
heavy
of
limb
tortured
by
rheumatic
pains
fernand
on
finishing
his
term
of
military
service
had
resolved
to
help
him
instead
of
seeking
employment
elsewhere
and
the
struggle
at
the
farm
was
the
same
bitter
one
as
of
old
the
family
living
from
father
to
son
on
the
fields
whence
it
seemed
to
have
sprung
and
toiling
and
moiling
blindly
in
its
stubborn
ignorance
and
neglect
of
progress
no
one
is
never
satisfied
fernand
slowly
resumed
you
are
not
with
things
monsieur
froment
in
spite
of
all
you
know
marc
detected
in
those
words
some
of
the
jeering
contempt
for
knowledge
which
was
to
be
expected
from
a
sleepy
dunce
who
in
his
had
found
it
difficult
to
remember
a
single
lesson
moreover
fernand
remark
embodied
a
prudent
allusion
to
the
events
which
were
upsetting
the
whole
region
and
marc
availed
himself
of
this
circumstance
to
inquire
into
his
former
pupil
views
i
am
always
pleased
when
my
boys
learn
their
lessons
fairly
well
and
do
tell
too
many
stories
he
said
gaily
know
that
very
well
just
remember
besides
i
received
some
good
news
about
the
affair
to
which
i
have
been
attending
so
long
yes
the
innocence
of
my
poor
friend
simon
is
about
to
be
recognised
for
good
at
this
fernand
manifested
great
embarrassment
his
countenance
became
heavier
and
the
light
in
his
eyes
died
away
that
not
what
some
folk
say
he
remarked
do
they
say
then
say
that
the
judges
have
found
out
more
things
about
the
old
schoolmaster
things
are
those
all
sorts
it
seems
at
last
fernand
consented
to
explain
himself
and
started
on
a
ridiculous
yarn
the
jews
said
he
had
given
a
big
sum
of
money
five
millions
of
francs
to
their
simon
in
order
that
he
might
get
a
brother
of
the
christian
doctrine
guillotined
simon
having
failed
in
his
plan
the
five
millions
were
lying
in
a
and
the
jews
were
now
striving
to
get
brother
gorgias
sent
to
the
galleys
even
if
in
doing
so
they
should
drown
france
in
blood
in
order
that
simon
might
return
and
dig
up
the
treasure
the
of
which
was
known
only
to
himself
my
lad
marc
answered
quite
aghast
you
do
believe
such
absurdity
why
not
rejoined
the
young
peasant
who
looked
only
half
awake
because
your
good
sense
ought
to
rebel
against
it
you
know
how
to
read
you
know
how
to
write
and
i
flattered
myself
also
that
i
had
in
some
degree
awakened
your
mind
and
taught
you
how
to
distinguish
between
truth
and
falsehood
come
come
have
you
remembered
anything
of
what
you
learnt
when
you
were
with
me
fernand
waved
his
hand
in
a
tired
careless
way
one
had
to
remember
everything
monsieur
froment
one
would
have
one
head
too
full
he
said
have
only
told
you
what
i
hear
people
saying
everywhere
folks
who
are
far
cleverer
than
i
am
give
their
word
of
honour
that
it
true
besides
i
read
something
like
it
in
petit
the
day
before
yesterday
and
since
it
in
print
there
must
surely
be
some
truth
in
it
marc
made
a
gesture
of
despair
what
he
had
not
overcome
ignorance
more
than
that
after
all
his
years
of
striving
that
young
fellow
remained
the
easiest
prey
for
error
and
falsehood
he
blindly
accepted
the
most
stupid
inventions
he
possessed
neither
the
freedom
of
mind
nor
the
sense
of
logic
necessary
to
enable
him
to
weigh
the
fables
which
he
read
in
his
newspaper
so
great
indeed
was
his
credulity
that
it
seemed
to
disturb
even
his
wife
the
blonde
lucile
said
she
raising
her
eyes
from
her
work
treasure
of
five
millions
that
is
a
great
deal
of
money
though
lucile
had
failed
to
secure
a
certificate
she
had
been
one
of
mademoiselle
rouzaire
passable
pupils
and
her
mind
now
seemed
to
have
awakened
it
was
said
she
was
pious
in
former
days
the
schoolmistress
had
somewhat
proudly
cited
her
as
an
example
on
account
of
the
glib
manner
in
which
she
recited
the
long
gospel
narrative
of
the
passion
without
making
a
single
mistake
but
since
her
marriage
though
one
still
found
in
her
the
sly
submissiveness
and
the
hypocritical
restrictions
of
a
woman
on
whom
the
church
had
set
its
mark
she
had
ceased
to
follow
the
usual
observances
and
she
even
discussed
things
a
little
millions
in
a
marc
repeated
millions
slumbering
there
pending
the
return
of
my
poor
simon
it
madness
but
what
of
all
the
new
documents
that
have
been
discovered
all
the
proofs
against
brother
gorgias
lucile
was
becoming
bolder
with
a
pretty
laugh
she
exclaimed
brother
gorgias
is
worth
much
he
may
well
have
a
weight
on
his
conscience
though
all
the
same
it
would
be
as
well
to
leave
him
quiet
on
account
of
religion
but
i
also
read
the
newspapers
and
they
made
me
reflect
well
concluded
fernand
would
never
finish
if
one
had
to
reflect
after
reading
it
far
better
to
remain
quiet
in
one
corner
marc
was
again
about
to
protest
when
a
sound
of
footsteps
made
him
turn
his
head
and
he
perceived
old
bongard
and
his
wife
who
also
had
just
returned
from
the
fields
with
their
daughter
angèle
bongard
who
had
heard
his
son
last
words
at
once
addressed
himself
to
the
schoolmaster
the
lad
says
is
quite
true
monsieur
froment
it
best
not
to
worry
one
mind
with
reading
so
much
stuff
in
my
time
we
did
not
read
the
papers
at
all
and
we
were
no
worse
off
is
that
so
wife
it
is
declared
la
bongard
energetically
but
angèle
who
in
spite
of
her
hard
nut
had
won
a
certificate
at
mademoiselle
rouzaire
by
force
of
stubbornness
smiled
in
a
knowing
manner
an
inner
light
fighting
its
way
through
dense
matter
occasionally
illumined
the
whole
of
her
face
which
with
its
short
nose
and
large
mouth
remained
at
other
moments
so
dull
and
heavy
in
a
few
weeks
time
angèle
was
to
marry
auguste
doloir
her
lucile
brother
a
big
strapping
fellow
following
like
his
father
the
calling
of
a
mason
and
the
girl
already
indulged
in
ambitious
dreams
for
him
some
start
in
business
on
his
own
account
when
she
should
be
beside
him
to
guide
his
steps
in
response
to
her
father
words
she
quietly
remarked
for
my
part
i
much
prefer
to
know
things
one
can
never
succeed
unless
one
does
everybody
deceives
and
robs
one
you
yourself
mamma
would
have
given
three
too
many
to
the
tinker
yesterday
if
i
had
not
run
through
his
bill
they
all
jogged
their
heads
and
then
marc
in
a
thoughtful
mood
resumed
his
walk
that
farmyard
where
he
had
just
lingered
for
a
few
minutes
had
not
changed
since
the
now
day
of
arrest
when
he
had
entered
it
seeking
for
favourable
evidence
the
bongards
had
remained
the
same
full
of
crass
suspicious
silent
ignorance
like
poor
beings
scarce
raised
from
the
soil
who
ever
trembled
lest
they
should
be
devoured
by
others
bigger
and
stronger
than
themselves
and
the
only
new
element
was
that
supplied
by
the
children
whose
progress
however
was
of
the
slightest
for
if
they
knew
a
little
more
than
their
parents
they
had
been
weakened
by
the
incompleteness
of
their
education
and
had
fallen
into
other
imbecilities
yet
after
all
they
had
taken
a
step
forward
and
the
slightest
step
forward
on
mankind
long
road
must
tend
to
hope
a
few
days
later
marc
repaired
to
doloir
in
order
to
speak
to
him
of
an
idea
which
he
had
at
heart
auguste
and
charles
the
mason
elder
sons
had
formerly
belonged
to
his
school
and
their
younger
brother
léon
had
lately
achieved
great
success
there
having
won
his
certificate
already
in
his
twelfth
year
for
that
very
reason
however
he
was
about
to
quit
the
school
and
his
departure
worried
marc
for
desirous
as
the
latter
was
of
securing
good
recruits
for
the
elementary
education
staff
of
which
salvan
spoke
to
him
at
times
so
anxiously
he
dreamt
of
making
the
lad
a
schoolmaster
on
reaching
the
flat
over
the
wineshop
in
the
rue
plaisir
where
the
mason
still
dwelt
marc
found
madame
doloir
alone
for
the
moment
with
léon
though
the
men
would
soon
be
home
from
work
she
listened
to
the
schoolmaster
very
attentively
in
her
serious
and
somewhat
way
like
a
good
housewife
who
only
thought
of
the
family
interests
and
then
she
answered
monsieur
froment
i
do
think
it
possible
we
shall
have
need
of
léon
we
mean
to
apprentice
him
at
once
where
could
we
find
the
money
to
enable
him
to
continue
his
studies
things
like
that
cost
too
much
even
when
they
cost
nothing
and
turning
to
the
boy
she
added
that
so
a
carpenter
trade
suits
you
best
my
own
father
was
a
carpenter
but
léon
whose
eyes
glittered
was
bold
enough
to
declare
his
preference
no
mamma
said
he
should
be
so
pleased
if
i
could
continue
learning
marc
was
backing
up
the
boy
when
doloir
came
in
accompanied
by
his
elder
sons
auguste
worked
for
the
same
master
as
his
father
and
on
their
way
home
they
had
called
for
charles
who
was
employed
by
a
neighbouring
locksmith
on
learning
what
was
afoot
doloir
quickly
sided
with
his
wife
who
was
regarded
as
the
clever
one
of
the
home
the
maintainer
of
sound
traditions
true
she
was
an
honest
and
a
worthy
woman
but
one
who
clung
stubbornly
to
routine
and
who
showed
much
narrow
egotism
and
her
husband
though
he
put
on
airs
of
bravado
like
an
old
soldier
whose
ideas
had
been
broadened
by
regimental
life
invariably
bowed
to
her
decisions
footnote
in
the
author
proofs
of
the
earlier
part
of
doloir
the
mason
is
said
to
have
a
young
son
named
léon
savin
the
clerk
having
one
called
jules
see
some
confusion
seems
to
have
arisen
subsequently
in
zola
mind
with
respect
to
these
boys
for
in
later
passages
of
the
french
original
the
name
of
jules
is
given
to
doloir
child
and
that
of
léon
to
savin
this
error
would
undoubtedly
have
been
rectified
but
for
zola
sudden
death
in
the
present
translation
jules
has
been
changed
to
léon
and
léon
to
jules
wherever
no
monsieur
froment
he
said
do
think
it
possible
let
us
reason
a
little
marc
answered
patiently
will
undertake
to
prepare
léon
for
the
training
school
there
we
shall
obtain
a
scholarship
for
him
so
it
will
cost
you
absolutely
nothing
what
of
his
food
all
that
time
the
mother
asked
just
one
more
when
there
are
several
at
table
does
not
mean
a
great
expense
one
may
well
risk
a
little
for
a
child
when
he
gives
one
such
bright
hopes
at
this
the
two
elder
brothers
began
to
laugh
like
fellows
who
felt
amused
by
the
proud
yet
anxious
bearing
of
their
junior
say
youngster
so
you
are
to
be
the
great
man
of
the
family
eh
exclaimed
auguste
do
put
on
too
much
side
for
we
won
our
certificates
also
that
sufficed
for
us
we
had
enough
and
to
spare
of
all
the
things
that
one
finds
in
books
for
my
own
part
i
much
prefer
to
temper
my
mortar
and
addressing
the
schoolmaster
auguste
continued
gaily
did
i
worry
you
monsieur
froment
i
could
never
keep
still
there
were
days
i
remember
when
i
revolutionised
the
whole
class
fortunately
charles
was
a
little
more
reasonable
doubt
said
charles
smiling
in
his
turn
i
always
ended
by
following
you
for
i
did
wish
to
be
thought
timid
or
stupid
no
no
responded
auguste
by
way
of
conclusion
were
only
and
idle
and
nowadays
we
offer
you
every
apology
monsieur
froment
and
i
agree
with
you
i
think
that
if
léon
has
a
taste
that
way
he
ought
to
be
helped
on
dash
it
all
one
must
be
on
the
side
of
progress
those
words
gave
much
pleasure
to
marc
who
thought
it
as
well
to
rest
content
with
them
that
day
and
to
postpone
the
task
of
finally
prevailing
over
the
parents
however
continuing
his
conversation
with
auguste
for
a
moment
he
told
him
that
he
had
lately
seen
his
betrothed
angèle
bongard
a
shrewd
little
person
who
seemed
determined
to
make
her
way
in
life
then
seeing
the
young
man
laugh
again
and
look
very
much
flattered
marc
thought
of
pursuing
his
investigations
and
ascertaining
what
might
be
the
views
of
his
former
pupil
on
the
question
which
interested
him
so
deeply
also
saw
fernand
bongard
your
he
said
remember
when
he
was
at
school
with
you
the
brothers
again
became
hilarious
oh
he
had
a
hard
nut
and
no
mistake
said
auguste
and
do
you
know
in
that
unfortunate
simon
affair
fernand
believes
that
a
treasure
of
five
millions
of
francs
given
by
the
jews
is
hidden
away
somewhere
in
readiness
for
the
unhappy
prisoner
whenever
one
may
succeed
in
bringing
him
back
from
the
galleys
and
setting
a
brother
of
the
christian
doctrine
in
his
place
as
these
words
fell
from
marc
lips
madame
doloir
became
very
grave
drawing
her
little
figure
together
and
then
remaining
motionless
while
her
husband
on
his
side
made
a
gesture
of
annoyance
and
muttered
between
his
teeth
another
matter
which
my
wife
rightly
enough
does
not
wish
us
to
meddle
with
but
auguste
who
seemed
very
much
amused
exclaimed
i
know
the
story
of
the
treasure
which
appeared
in
petit
i
not
surprised
at
fernand
swallowing
that
yarn
five
millions
hidden
in
the
ground
it
nonsense
at
this
his
father
looked
vexed
and
emerged
from
his
reserve
treasure
said
he
not
you
are
not
so
clever
as
you
fancy
youngster
you
do
know
what
the
jews
are
capable
of
i
knew
a
corporal
in
my
regiment
who
had
been
a
servant
to
a
jewish
banker
well
every
saturday
he
saw
that
banker
send
casks
full
of
gold
to
germany
all
the
gold
of
france
as
he
used
to
say
we
are
sold
that
quite
certain
but
auguste
who
never
showed
any
great
respect
for
anybody
retorted
no
father
you
must
not
dish
up
the
old
stories
of
your
regiment
i
just
come
back
from
barracks
you
know
and
it
all
too
stupid
you
soon
see
that
for
yourself
my
poor
charles
auguste
indeed
had
lately
finished
his
term
of
military
service
and
charles
in
his
turn
would
have
to
join
the
colours
in
october
for
my
part
auguste
continued
ca
swallow
that
absurd
yarn
of
five
millions
buried
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
and
waiting
to
be
dug
up
on
some
moonlight
night
at
the
same
time
that
does
not
prevent
me
from
thinking
that
one
would
do
well
to
leave
that
man
simon
yonder
without
troubling
one
brains
any
more
about
his
innocence
marc
who
had
felt
pleased
by
the
intelligent
things
said
by
his
former
pupil
was
painfully
surprised
by
that
sudden
conclusion
is
that
he
inquired
simon
is
innocent
just
think
of
the
torture
he
has
undergone
we
should
never
be
able
to
offer
him
sufficient
reparation
innocent
that
remains
to
be
proved
though
i
often
read
what
is
printed
my
mind
only
gets
the
more
fogged
by
it
is
because
you
only
read
falsehoods
said
marc
it
is
now
known
that
the
came
from
the
brothers
school
the
corner
which
was
torn
off
and
which
was
found
at
father
philibin
is
the
proof
of
it
and
the
ridiculous
blunder
which
the
experts
made
is
demonstrated
for
the
paraph
is
certainly
in
the
handwriting
of
brother
gorgias
i
do
know
all
that
auguste
answered
can
i
read
everything
that
is
printed
as
i
said
just
now
the
more
people
try
to
explain
the
affair
to
me
the
less
i
understand
of
it
but
after
all
as
the
experts
and
the
court
formerly
ascribed
the
to
the
prisoner
the
simplest
thing
is
to
believe
that
it
was
really
his
from
that
opinion
auguste
would
not
retreat
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
marc
who
after
imagining
for
a
moment
that
the
young
fellow
possessed
a
free
mind
was
pained
to
discover
that
he
had
such
narrow
views
and
such
a
faint
perception
of
truth
that
is
sufficient
at
last
said
madame
doloir
in
the
authoritative
manner
of
a
prudent
woman
must
excuse
me
monsieur
froment
if
i
ask
you
to
talk
no
more
of
that
affair
here
you
do
as
you
please
on
your
side
and
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
it
only
for
poor
folk
like
ourselves
it
is
best
that
we
should
not
meddle
with
what
does
not
concern
us
it
would
concern
you
madame
if
one
of
your
sons
should
be
taken
and
sent
to
the
galleys
in
spite
of
his
innocence
and
we
are
fighting
remember
to
prevent
such
monstrous
injustice
from
ever
being
repeated
so
monsieur
froment
but
one
of
my
sons
wo
be
taken
for
as
it
happens
i
try
to
get
on
well
with
everybody
even
the
priests
the
priests
are
very
strong
you
see
and
i
would
rather
not
have
them
after
me
thereupon
doloir
was
moved
to
intervene
in
a
patriotic
way
i
do
care
a
curse
about
the
priests
he
exclaimed
a
question
of
defending
the
country
and
the
government
allows
us
to
be
humiliated
by
the
english
also
will
please
to
keep
quiet
his
wife
immediately
retorted
is
best
to
leave
both
the
government
and
the
priests
alone
try
to
get
bread
to
eat
that
will
be
far
better
then
doloir
had
to
bend
his
head
in
spite
of
the
circumstance
that
among
his
mates
he
posed
as
being
a
socialist
though
he
hardly
knew
the
meaning
of
the
word
as
for
auguste
and
charles
though
they
belonged
to
a
generation
they
sided
with
their
mother
almost
spoilt
as
they
were
by
their
too
ignorant
as
yet
to
recognise
the
law
of
human
solidarity
which
demands
that
the
happiness
of
each
should
be
compounded
of
the
happiness
of
all
only
little
léon
with
his
ardent
thirst
for
knowledge
remained
impassioned
full
of
anxiety
also
as
to
the
turn
which
things
were
taking
marc
who
was
sorely
grieved
felt
that
further
discussion
would
be
useless
so
taking
his
departure
he
contented
himself
with
saying
madame
i
will
see
you
again
and
i
hope
to
persuade
you
to
allow
léon
to
continue
his
studies
so
that
he
may
become
a
schoolmaster
so
monsieur
froment
the
mother
answered
remember
it
must
not
cost
us
a
for
in
any
case
we
shall
be
sadly
out
of
pocket
some
bitter
thoughts
came
over
marc
as
he
returned
home
as
in
the
case
of
the
bongards
he
was
reminded
of
the
visit
he
had
made
to
the
doloirs
on
the
day
of
simon
arrest
those
sorry
folk
who
were
condemned
to
a
life
of
excessive
toil
and
who
imagined
they
defended
themselves
by
remaining
in
darkness
and
taking
no
interest
in
what
went
on
around
them
had
in
no
way
changed
they
were
determined
that
they
would
know
nothing
for
fear
lest
knowledge
should
bring
them
increase
of
wretchedness
the
sons
no
doubt
were
rather
more
enlightened
than
the
parents
but
not
enough
to
engage
in
any
work
of
truth
and
if
they
had
begun
to
reason
and
no
longer
believed
in
idiotic
fables
how
much
ground
there
still
remained
for
their
children
to
cover
before
their
minds
should
be
freed
completely
from
error
it
was
grievous
indeed
that
the
march
of
progress
should
be
so
slow
and
yet
it
was
necessary
to
remain
content
if
one
desired
to
retain
enough
courage
to
pursue
the
arduous
task
of
teaching
and
delivering
the
humble
on
another
occasion
a
little
later
marc
happened
to
meet
savin
the
clerk
with
whom
he
had
had
some
unpleasant
quarrels
at
the
time
when
that
embittered
man
twin
sons
achille
and
philippe
had
attended
the
school
savin
had
then
thought
it
good
policy
to
serve
the
church
although
he
publicly
pretended
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
for
he
was
continually
dreading
lest
he
should
offend
his
superiors
however
two
catastrophes
which
fell
upon
him
in
rapid
succession
steeped
him
in
irremediable
bitterness
first
of
all
things
took
a
very
bad
turn
with
his
pretty
daughter
hortense
that
model
pupil
in
whose
ardent
fervour
at
her
first
communion
mademoiselle
rouzaire
had
gloried
but
who
in
reality
was
full
of
precocious
hypocrisy
savin
recognising
the
girl
beauty
had
dreamt
of
marrying
her
to
the
son
of
one
of
his
superiors
but
instead
of
that
he
was
compelled
to
marry
her
to
a
milkman
assistant
who
led
her
astray
then
to
complete
the
clerk
mortification
and
despair
he
discovered
that
his
wife
the
refined
and
marguerite
had
become
unfaithful
to
him
in
spite
of
her
repugnance
he
had
long
compelled
her
to
go
to
confession
and
communion
holding
that
religion
was
a
needful
curb
for
feminine
depravity
but
as
it
happened
her
frequent
attendance
at
the
chapel
of
the
capuchins
whose
superior
father
théodose
was
her
confessor
led
to
her
downfall
for
that
same
holy
man
became
her
lover
the
facts
were
never
exactly
known
for
no
scandal
was
raised
by
savin
who
however
great
his
rage
was
overcome
by
the
irony
of
things
it
was
he
himself
indeed
who
by
his
imbecile
jealousy
had
turned
his
previously
faithful
wife
into
the
path
of
infidelity
but
if
he
raised
no
great
outcry
people
declared
that
he
revenged
himself
terribly
on
the
unhappy
woman
in
the
abominable
hell
which
their
home
had
now
become
having
cause
to
hate
the
priests
and
the
monks
savin
had
drawn
a
trifle
nearer
to
marc
on
the
day
when
they
met
in
the
street
the
clerk
had
just
quitted
his
office
and
was
walking
along
with
a
sour
and
sleepy
face
like
some
old
circus
horse
half
stupefied
by
his
round
of
duties
on
perceiving
the
schoolmaster
he
seemed
to
wake
up
i
am
pleased
to
meet
you
monsieur
froment
he
said
would
be
very
kind
of
you
to
come
as
far
as
my
rooms
for
my
son
philippe
is
causing
me
great
anxiety
by
his
idleness
and
you
are
the
only
person
who
knows
how
to
lecture
him
replied
marc
who
was
always
desirous
of
seeing
and
judging
things
on
reaching
the
dismal
little
lodging
in
the
rue
fauche
they
found
madame
savin
who
still
looked
charming
in
spite
of
her
years
engaged
on
some
bead
flowers
which
had
to
be
delivered
that
same
evening
since
his
misfortune
the
clerk
was
no
longer
ashamed
of
letting
people
see
his
wife
toil
as
if
she
were
a
mere
workwoman
perhaps
indeed
he
hoped
it
would
be
thought
that
she
was
expiating
her
transgression
in
former
times
he
had
evinced
much
pride
in
her
when
she
went
out
wearing
a
lady
bonnet
but
now
she
might
well
put
on
an
apron
and
contribute
to
the
support
of
the
family
he
himself
also
neglected
his
appearance
and
had
given
up
wearing
frock
coats
no
sooner
did
he
enter
the
flat
than
he
became
brutal
taken
possession
of
the
whole
room
as
usual
he
shouted
can
i
ask
monsieur
froment
to
sit
down
gentle
timid
and
somewhat
red
of
face
his
wife
hastened
to
gather
up
her
reels
and
boxes
when
i
work
my
friend
she
said
need
some
room
besides
i
did
not
expect
you
home
so
soon
yes
i
know
you
never
expect
those
words
in
which
perhaps
there
was
some
cruel
allusion
to
what
had
happened
quite
upset
the
unfortunate
woman
one
thing
which
her
husband
did
not
forgive
her
was
her
lover
handsomeness
particularly
as
he
knew
that
he
himself
was
so
puny
and
sickly
and
nothing
enraged
himself
more
than
to
read
his
wife
excuse
in
her
clear
eyes
however
she
now
bent
her
head
and
made
herself
as
small
as
possible
while
she
resumed
her
work
down
monsieur
froment
said
savin
i
was
telling
you
just
now
that
big
fellow
yonder
drives
me
to
despair
he
is
now
nearly
he
has
already
tried
two
or
three
trades
and
all
he
seems
to
be
good
for
is
to
watch
his
mother
work
and
pass
her
the
beads
she
may
require
young
philippe
indeed
was
sitting
in
a
corner
of
the
room
silent
and
motionless
like
one
who
strove
to
keep
in
the
background
madame
savin
amidst
her
humiliation
had
given
him
a
tender
glance
to
which
he
had
responded
by
a
slight
smile
as
if
by
way
of
consolation
one
could
detect
that
he
and
his
mother
were
linked
together
by
some
bond
of
suffering
pale
and
of
poor
health
the
sly
cowardly
and
mendacious
schoolboy
of
former
times
had
become
a
sorry
young
fellow
quite
destitute
it
seemed
of
energy
who
sought
a
refuge
in
his
mother
kindness
of
heart
she
still
so
young
in
appearance
looking
like
an
elder
sister
one
who
also
suffered
and
who
therefore
sympathised
with
him
did
you
not
listen
to
me
marc
exclaimed
in
answer
to
the
clerk
would
have
made
a
schoolmaster
of
him
but
savin
protested
no
indeed
rather
than
that
i
prefer
to
have
him
on
my
hands
to
cram
one
brains
at
school
till
one
is
over
twenty
then
start
at
a
paltry
salary
of
sixty
francs
a
month
and
work
for
more
than
ten
years
before
earning
a
hundred
do
you
call
that
a
profession
a
schoolmaster
indeed
nobody
cares
to
become
one
nowadays
even
the
poorest
peasants
would
rather
break
stones
on
the
highways
i
thought
i
had
persuaded
you
to
let
your
son
jules
enter
the
training
college
marc
rejoined
you
intend
to
make
him
an
elementary
teacher
dear
no
i
put
him
with
an
merchant
barely
sixteen
and
he
is
already
earning
twenty
francs
a
month
he
will
thank
me
for
it
later
on
marc
made
a
gesture
expressive
of
his
regret
he
remembered
having
seen
jules
as
a
babe
in
swaddling
clothes
in
his
mother
arms
later
the
lad
from
his
seventh
to
his
fourteenth
year
had
become
one
of
his
pupils
a
pupil
who
evinced
much
higher
intelligence
than
his
elder
brothers
and
who
inspired
great
hopes
like
the
master
madame
savin
no
doubt
was
worried
that
her
youngest
boy
studies
had
been
cut
short
by
his
father
for
again
raising
her
beautiful
eyes
she
glanced
at
marc
furtively
and
sadly
said
her
husband
to
the
latter
advice
can
you
give
me
and
first
of
all
ca
you
make
that
big
idler
feel
ashamed
of
his
sloth
as
you
were
his
master
perhaps
he
will
listen
to
you
at
that
moment
however
achille
the
other
son
came
in
returning
from
the
office
where
he
was
now
employed
he
had
made
a
start
there
as
an
errand
boy
when
he
was
fifteen
and
though
nearly
seven
years
had
elapsed
he
did
not
yet
earn
enough
to
keep
himself
paler
and
of
even
poorer
blood
than
his
brother
philippe
he
had
remained
a
beardless
stripling
sly
pusillanimous
and
distrustful
as
in
his
ever
ready
to
denounce
a
comrade
in
order
to
escape
personal
punishment
he
seemed
surprised
on
seeing
his
former
master
and
after
bowing
to
him
he
said
doubtless
in
a
spirit
of
malice
do
know
what
there
can
be
in
petit
but
people
are
almost
fighting
for
copies
at
mesdames
milhomme
it
must
certainly
be
something
more
about
that
beastly
affair
marc
already
knew
that
the
paper
contained
a
fresh
rectification
brimful
of
extraordinary
mendacious
impudence
on
the
part
of
brother
gorgias
and
he
decided
to
avail
himself
of
this
opportunity
to
sound
the
young
men
said
he
petit
may
attempt
with
its
stories
of
buried
millions
and
its
superb
denials
of
facts
everybody
is
beginning
to
admit
that
simon
is
innocent
at
this
the
twins
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
achille
in
his
drawling
way
replied
only
imbeciles
believe
in
those
buried
millions
and
it
true
that
they
are
lying
too
much
one
can
see
it
but
what
does
it
all
matter
to
us
what
does
it
matter
to
you
the
schoolmaster
exclaimed
surprised
and
failing
to
understand
what
interest
is
there
for
us
in
that
affair
with
which
we
have
been
plagued
so
long
then
marc
gradually
became
impassioned
poor
lads
i
feel
sorry
for
you
he
said
admit
innocence
do
you
not
yes
it
is
by
no
means
clear
as
yet
but
when
one
has
read
things
attentively
it
does
seem
that
he
may
be
innocent
that
case
do
not
your
feelings
rebel
at
the
idea
that
he
is
in
prison
it
certainly
is
amusing
for
him
achille
admitted
there
are
so
many
other
innocent
people
in
prison
besides
the
officials
may
release
him
for
all
i
care
one
has
quite
enough
worries
of
own
so
why
should
one
spoil
one
life
by
meddling
with
the
troubles
of
others
then
philippe
in
a
more
gentle
voice
expressed
his
opinion
saying
do
bother
about
that
affair
for
it
would
worry
me
too
much
i
can
understand
that
it
would
be
one
duty
to
act
if
one
were
the
master
but
when
one
can
do
nothing
whatever
the
best
way
is
to
ignore
it
all
and
keep
quiet
in
vain
did
marc
censure
the
indifference
the
cowardly
egotism
and
desertion
which
those
words
implied
the
great
voice
the
irresistible
will
of
the
people
said
he
was
compounded
of
individual
protests
the
protests
of
the
humblest
and
the
weakest
nobody
could
claim
exemption
from
his
duty
the
action
of
one
single
isolated
individual
might
suffice
to
modify
destiny
besides
it
was
not
true
to
say
that
only
one
person
fate
was
at
stake
in
the
struggle
all
the
members
of
the
nation
were
jointly
and
severally
interested
for
each
defended
his
own
liberty
by
protecting
that
of
his
fellow
and
then
what
a
splendid
opportunity
it
was
to
accomplish
at
one
stroke
the
work
of
a
century
of
slow
political
and
social
progress
on
one
side
all
the
forces
of
reaction
were
leagued
against
an
unhappy
innocent
man
for
the
sole
purpose
of
keeping
the
old
catholic
and
monarchical
scaffoldings
erect
and
on
the
other
all
who
were
bent
on
ensuring
the
triumph
of
the
future
all
who
believed
in
reason
and
liberty
had
gathered
together
from
the
four
points
of
the
compass
and
united
in
the
name
of
truth
and
justice
and
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
latter
ought
to
suffice
to
throw
the
former
beneath
the
remnants
of
those
old
scaffoldings
which
were
cracking
on
all
sides
the
scope
of
the
affair
had
expanded
it
was
no
longer
merely
the
case
of
a
poor
innocent
man
who
had
been
wrongly
convicted
for
that
man
had
become
the
incarnation
of
the
martyrdom
of
all
mankind
which
must
be
wrested
from
the
prison
of
the
ages
the
release
of
simon
indeed
would
mean
increase
of
freedom
for
the
people
of
france
and
an
acceleration
of
its
march
towards
more
dignity
and
happiness
but
marc
suddenly
lapsed
into
silence
for
he
saw
that
achille
and
philippe
were
looking
at
him
in
bewilderment
their
weak
eyes
blinking
in
their
pale
and
sickly
faces
monsieur
froment
what
all
that
when
you
put
so
many
things
into
the
affair
we
ca
follow
you
that
certain
we
know
nothing
of
those
things
we
can
do
nothing
savin
for
his
part
had
listened
sneering
and
fidgeting
though
unwilling
to
interrupt
now
however
turning
to
the
schoolmaster
he
exploded
that
is
humbug
excuse
me
for
saying
so
monsieur
froment
simon
innocent
well
that
a
matter
on
which
i
have
my
doubts
i
do
conceal
it
i
of
the
same
opinion
as
formerly
and
i
read
nothing
i
would
rather
let
myself
be
killed
than
consent
to
swallow
a
line
of
all
the
trash
that
is
published
and
mind
i
say
that
because
i
like
the
priests
the
dirty
beasts
why
i
wish
a
pestilence
would
sweep
them
all
away
only
when
there
is
a
religion
there
is
one
it
the
same
with
the
army
the
army
is
the
blood
of
france
i
am
a
republican
i
am
now
a
freemason
i
will
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
i
am
a
socialist
in
the
good
sense
of
the
word
but
before
everything
else
i
am
a
frenchman
and
i
wo
have
people
setting
their
hands
on
what
constitutes
the
grandeur
of
my
country
simon
then
is
guilty
everything
proves
it
public
sentiment
the
proofs
submitted
to
the
court
his
condemnation
and
the
ignoble
trafficking
carried
on
by
the
jews
in
order
to
save
him
and
if
by
a
miracle
he
should
not
be
guilty
the
misfortune
for
the
country
would
be
too
great
it
would
be
absolutely
necessary
that
he
should
be
guilty
all
the
same
confronted
by
so
much
blindness
blended
with
so
much
folly
marc
could
only
bow
and
he
was
about
to
withdraw
when
savin
daughter
hortense
made
her
appearance
with
her
little
girl
charlotte
now
nearly
seven
years
of
age
hortense
was
no
longer
the
young
person
of
former
days
compelled
to
marry
her
seducer
the
milkman
assistant
and
lead
with
him
a
hard
and
toilsome
life
of
poverty
she
appeared
faded
and
careworn
savin
moreover
received
her
without
cordiality
full
of
spite
as
he
was
ashamed
of
that
marriage
which
had
mortified
his
pride
only
the
grace
and
keen
intelligence
of
little
charlotte
assuaged
in
some
slight
degree
his
intensely
bitter
feelings
grandpapa
grandmamma
said
the
child
know
i
have
been
first
in
reading
again
and
mademoiselle
mazeline
has
given
me
the
medal
she
was
a
charming
little
girl
and
madame
savin
dropping
her
beads
at
once
took
her
on
her
lap
kissing
her
and
feeling
consoled
and
happy
but
the
child
turning
towards
marc
with
whom
she
was
well
acquainted
resumed
know
i
was
the
first
monsieur
froment
it
fine
it
to
be
the
first
footnote
in
french
elementary
schools
the
child
who
becomes
first
in
his
or
her
class
is
given
a
medal
which
is
worn
pinned
to
jacket
or
frock
should
the
position
be
lost
the
medal
has
to
be
restored
to
the
teacher
who
then
transfers
it
to
the
more
successful
my
dear
said
the
master
is
very
nice
to
be
first
and
i
know
that
you
are
always
very
good
mind
you
must
always
listen
to
mademoiselle
mazeline
because
she
will
make
a
very
clever
and
sensible
little
woman
of
you
one
who
will
be
very
happy
and
who
will
give
a
deal
of
happiness
to
all
her
family
around
her
at
this
savin
again
began
to
growl
happiness
to
all
her
family
indeed
well
that
would
be
something
new
for
neither
the
grandmother
nor
the
mother
had
given
any
happiness
to
him
and
if
mademoiselle
mazeline
should
perform
such
a
miracle
as
to
turn
a
girl
into
something
decent
and
useful
he
would
go
to
tell
mademoiselle
rouzaire
of
it
then
annoyed
at
seeing
his
wife
laugh
brightened
as
she
was
rejuvenated
so
to
say
by
the
companionship
of
the
child
he
bade
her
get
on
with
her
work
speaking
in
so
rough
a
voice
that
as
the
unhappy
woman
again
lowered
her
head
over
her
bead
flowers
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
but
marc
had
now
risen
and
the
clerk
thereupon
reverted
to
the
matter
he
had
at
heart
you
can
give
me
no
advice
about
my
big
idler
philippe
do
you
think
that
through
monsieur
salvan
who
is
the
friend
of
monsieur
le
barazer
you
might
get
him
some
petty
situation
at
the
préfecture
certainly
i
might
try
i
will
speak
to
monsieur
salvan
about
it
i
promise
you
marc
then
withdrew
and
on
reaching
the
street
walked
slowly
his
head
bent
while
he
summed
up
the
results
of
his
visits
to
the
parents
of
his
former
pupils
no
doubt
he
had
found
achille
and
philippe
possessed
of
riper
and
broader
minds
than
auguste
and
charles
the
sons
of
doloir
the
mason
even
as
he
had
found
the
latter
freed
from
the
low
credulity
of
fernand
the
son
of
the
peasant
bongard
but
at
the
savins
he
had
once
again
observed
the
blind
obstinacy
of
the
father
who
had
learnt
nothing
forgotten
nothing
but
still
lingered
in
the
same
old
rut
of
error
whilst
even
the
evolution
of
the
sons
towards
more
reason
and
logic
remained
a
very
slight
one
just
a
little
step
had
been
taken
no
more
and
with
that
marc
had
to
remain
content
he
felt
sad
indeed
when
he
compared
all
his
efforts
during
a
period
of
nearly
fifteen
years
with
the
little
amelioration
which
had
resulted
from
them
and
he
shuddered
as
he
thought
of
the
vast
amount
of
labour
devotion
and
faith
which
would
be
required
throughout
the
humble
world
of
the
elementary
teachers
before
they
would
succeed
in
transforming
the
brutified
soiled
enthralled
lowly
ones
and
suffering
ones
into
free
and
conscious
men
generations
indeed
would
be
necessary
for
that
to
be
effected
the
thought
of
poor
simon
haunted
marc
amid
the
grief
he
felt
at
having
failed
to
raise
a
people
of
truth
and
justice
such
as
would
have
the
strength
of
mind
to
rebel
against
the
old
iniquity
and
repair
it
the
nation
still
refused
to
be
the
noble
generous
and
equitable
nation
in
which
he
had
believed
so
long
and
both
his
mind
and
his
heart
were
pained
for
he
could
not
accustom
himself
to
the
idea
of
a
france
steeped
in
idiotic
fanaticism
then
however
a
bright
vision
flitted
before
his
eyes
he
again
saw
little
charlotte
so
and
so
delighted
at
being
the
first
of
her
class
and
he
began
to
hope
once
more
the
future
belonged
to
the
children
and
might
not
some
of
those
charming
little
ones
take
giant
steps
when
firm
and
upright
minds
should
direct
them
towards
the
light
however
as
marc
drew
near
to
the
school
another
meeting
brought
a
pang
to
his
heart
he
encountered
madame
férou
carrying
a
bundle
some
work
which
she
was
taking
home
with
her
having
lost
her
eldest
children
who
had
succumbed
more
to
want
than
to
disease
she
now
lived
with
her
remaining
girl
in
a
frightful
hovel
where
they
worked
themselves
almost
to
death
without
ever
earning
enough
to
satisfy
their
hunger
as
she
glided
along
the
street
with
downcast
eyes
as
if
ashamed
of
her
poverty
marc
stopped
her
she
was
no
longer
the
plump
and
blonde
with
fleshy
lips
and
large
bright
prominent
eyes
whom
he
had
known
in
past
years
but
a
poor
squat
careworn
woman
aged
before
her
time
madame
férou
he
inquired
the
sewing
prosper
a
little
she
began
to
stammer
then
at
last
regained
some
confidence
things
never
prosper
monsieur
froment
she
said
may
tire
our
eyes
out
but
we
are
lucky
when
we
manage
to
earn
a
day
between
us
what
about
the
application
for
relief
which
you
sent
to
the
préfecture
as
a
schoolmaster
widow
they
never
answered
me
and
when
i
ventured
to
call
there
in
person
i
really
thought
i
should
be
arrested
a
big
dark
man
with
a
fine
beard
asked
me
what
i
meant
by
daring
to
recall
the
memory
of
my
husband
the
deserter
and
anarchist
who
was
condemned
by
and
then
shot
like
a
mad
dog
and
he
frightened
me
so
much
that
i
still
tremble
when
i
think
of
it
then
as
marc
who
was
quivering
remained
silent
the
unhappy
woman
growing
bolder
and
bolder
resumed
heavens
my
poor
férou
a
mad
dog
you
knew
him
when
we
were
at
le
moreux
at
first
he
only
dreamt
of
devotion
fraternity
truth
and
justice
and
it
was
by
dint
of
wretchedness
persecution
and
iniquity
that
they
ended
by
maddening
him
when
he
left
me
never
to
return
he
said
to
me
france
is
done
for
it
has
been
completely
rotted
by
the
priests
poisoned
by
a
filthy
press
plunged
into
such
a
morass
of
ignorance
and
credulity
that
one
will
never
be
able
to
extricate
it
and
you
see
monsieur
froment
he
was
right
no
he
was
right
madame
férou
one
must
never
despair
of
country
but
her
blood
was
now
up
and
she
retorted
tell
you
that
he
right
have
you
any
eyes
to
see
are
not
affairs
shameful
at
le
moreux
where
that
man
chagnat
the
creature
of
the
priests
does
nothing
but
debase
and
stupefy
the
children
to
such
a
point
indeed
that
for
years
past
not
a
single
one
of
them
has
been
able
to
obtain
a
certificate
of
elementary
studies
and
then
monsieur
jauffre
your
successor
does
some
fine
work
at
jonville
in
order
to
please
abbé
cognasse
at
the
rate
they
are
all
going
france
will
have
forgotten
how
to
read
and
write
before
ten
years
are
over
she
drew
herself
up
as
she
spoke
and
consumed
by
hatred
and
rancour
the
rancour
of
a
poor
downtrodden
woman
overcome
by
social
injustice
she
went
on
to
prophesy
hear
me
monsieur
froment
i
tell
you
that
france
is
done
for
nothing
good
nor
just
will
ever
come
from
her
again
she
will
sink
to
the
level
of
all
those
dead
nations
on
whom
catholicism
has
preyed
like
vermin
and
rottenness
then
still
quivering
with
the
excitement
which
had
prompted
that
outburst
and
trembling
at
having
dared
to
say
so
much
she
glided
away
with
humble
and
anxious
mien
returning
to
the
den
of
suffering
where
her
pale
and
silent
daughter
awaited
her
marc
remained
confounded
it
was
as
if
he
had
heard
férou
himself
calling
from
his
grave
crying
aloud
the
bitter
pessimism
the
savage
protest
dictated
by
the
cruel
sufferings
of
his
life
and
making
all
allowance
for
rancorous
exaggeration
there
was
great
truth
in
the
widow
words
chagnat
indeed
was
still
brutifying
le
moreux
and
jauffre
under
the
stubborn
and
sway
of
abbé
cognasse
was
completing
his
deadly
work
at
jonville
in
spite
of
the
covert
rage
he
experienced
at
finding
that
his
services
remained
so
long
unrecognised
when
by
rights
he
ought
to
have
been
appointed
at
once
to
the
headmastership
of
a
school
at
beaumont
and
the
great
work
of
elementary
education
scarcely
made
more
progress
in
any
part
of
the
region
nearly
all
the
schools
of
beaumont
were
still
in
the
power
of
timid
masters
and
mistresses
who
thinking
of
their
advancement
wished
to
remain
on
good
terms
with
the
church
mademoiselle
rouzaire
achieved
great
success
by
her
devout
zeal
while
doutrequin
that
republican
of
the
early
days
whom
patriotic
alarm
had
gradually
cast
into
reaction
remained
though
he
was
now
on
the
retired
list
a
personage
of
great
influence
one
whose
lofty
character
was
cited
to
newcomers
by
way
of
example
how
could
young
teachers
believe
in
the
innocence
of
simon
and
fight
against
the
congregational
schools
when
such
a
man
a
combatant
of
a
friend
of
the
founder
of
the
republic
set
himself
on
the
side
of
the
congregations
in
the
name
of
the
country
threatened
by
the
jews
for
one
mademoiselle
mazeline
who
ever
firmly
inculcated
sense
and
kindliness
for
one
mignot
won
by
example
to
the
good
cause
how
many
cowards
and
traitors
there
were
and
how
very
slowly
did
the
teaching
staff
progress
in
breadth
of
mind
generosity
and
devotion
in
spite
of
the
reinforcements
which
came
to
it
every
year
from
the
training
schools
yet
salvan
persevered
in
his
work
of
regeneration
full
of
ardent
faith
convinced
that
the
humble
schoolmaster
alone
would
save
the
country
from
being
annihilated
by
the
clericals
when
he
himself
should
at
last
possess
a
free
mind
and
the
capacity
to
teach
truth
and
justice
as
salvan
ever
repeated
the
worth
of
the
nation
depended
on
the
worth
of
the
schoolmasters
and
if
the
march
of
progress
was
so
slow
it
was
because
the
work
of
evolution
by
which
good
masters
might
be
produced
had
to
be
spread
over
several
generations
even
as
several
generations
of
pupils
would
be
needed
before
a
just
nation
freed
from
error
and
falsehood
could
spring
into
being
having
reached
that
conclusion
as
the
result
of
his
inquiries
and
the
despairing
call
which
seemed
to
have
come
to
him
from
férou
grave
marc
only
retained
a
feverish
eagerness
to
continue
the
battle
and
increase
his
efforts
for
some
time
past
he
had
been
busying
himself
with
what
were
called
enterprises
established
in
order
to
maintain
a
link
between
the
masters
and
their
former
pupils
whom
the
laws
took
from
them
at
thirteen
years
of
age
friendly
societies
were
being
founded
on
all
sides
and
some
of
the
organisers
dreamt
of
federating
all
those
of
the
same
then
those
of
the
same
department
and
finally
all
similar
societies
in
france
moreover
there
were
patronage
societies
mutual
relief
and
pension
funds
but
marc
with
the
object
he
had
in
view
attached
most
importance
to
the
classes
for
adults
which
he
held
of
an
evening
at
his
school
mademoiselle
mazeline
on
her
side
also
had
set
an
excellent
example
and
won
very
great
success
by
giving
occasional
evening
lessons
in
cookery
family
hygiene
and
home
nursing
to
those
of
her
former
pupils
who
were
now
big
girls
and
such
numbers
of
young
people
applied
to
her
that
she
ended
by
sacrificing
her
sunday
afternoons
in
order
to
instruct
those
who
could
not
conveniently
attend
of
an
evening
it
made
her
so
happy
she
said
to
help
her
girls
to
become
good
wives
and
mothers
able
to
keep
house
and
shed
gaiety
health
and
happiness
around
them
marc
in
the
same
way
opened
his
school
on
three
evenings
every
week
summoned
back
the
boys
who
had
left
him
and
endeavoured
to
complete
their
education
with
respect
to
all
the
practical
questions
of
life
he
sowed
good
seed
in
those
young
brains
unsparingly
saying
to
himself
that
he
would
be
well
rewarded
for
his
pains
if
but
one
grain
out
of
every
hundred
should
germinate
and
bear
fruit
and
he
interested
himself
particularly
in
the
few
pupils
whom
he
induced
to
enter
the
teaching
profession
keeping
them
near
him
and
preparing
them
right
zealously
for
the
preliminary
examinations
at
the
training
college
on
his
side
indeed
he
devoted
his
sunday
afternoons
to
those
private
lessons
and
when
evening
came
he
was
as
delighted
as
if
he
had
been
indulging
in
the
greatest
amusement
one
of
marc
victories
at
this
juncture
was
to
prevail
on
madame
doloir
to
allow
him
to
continue
educating
little
léon
in
order
that
the
boy
might
enter
the
training
college
in
due
course
the
dearest
of
all
marc
former
pupils
sébastien
milhomme
was
there
already
and
sébastien
mother
madame
alexandre
had
on
her
side
returned
to
the
stationery
shop
though
she
discreetly
remained
in
the
background
for
fear
lest
she
might
scare
away
the
clerical
customers
and
salvan
like
marc
had
now
become
very
much
attached
to
sébastien
regarding
him
as
one
of
those
future
missionaries
of
good
tidings
whom
he
desired
to
disseminate
through
the
country
districts
recently
also
at
the
beginning
of
a
new
term
marc
had
experienced
the
satisfaction
of
confiding
to
his
old
friend
yet
another
pupil
none
other
than
joseph
simon
the
innocent
man
son
who
in
spite
of
every
painful
obstacle
had
resolved
to
become
a
schoolmaster
like
his
father
hoping
to
conquer
on
the
very
field
where
the
dear
stricken
prisoner
had
fought
with
so
tragical
a
result
thus
sébastien
and
joseph
had
met
again
each
inspired
with
the
same
zeal
the
same
faith
their
old
bond
of
friendship
tightened
by
yet
closer
sympathy
than
before
and
what
pleasant
hours
they
spent
whenever
an
afternoon
holiday
enabled
them
to
go
to
maillebois
together
to
shake
hands
with
their
former
master
while
things
were
thus
slowly
moving
marc
with
respect
to
his
home
troubles
remained
in
suspense
one
day
despairing
and
the
morrow
reviving
to
hope
in
vain
had
he
relied
on
geneviève
returning
to
him
enlightened
at
last
and
saved
from
the
poison
at
present
he
set
his
only
consolation
in
the
quiet
firmness
of
his
daughter
louise
she
as
she
had
promised
to
do
came
to
see
him
every
thursday
and
sunday
invariably
gay
and
full
of
gentle
resolution
he
dared
not
question
her
about
her
mother
respecting
whom
she
seldom
volunteered
any
information
for
having
no
good
news
to
give
she
doubtless
regarded
the
subject
as
painful
louise
would
now
soon
be
sixteen
and
with
increase
of
age
she
became
the
better
able
to
understand
the
cause
of
their
sufferings
she
would
have
been
pleased
indeed
could
she
have
become
the
mediator
the
healer
the
one
to
place
the
parents
she
loved
so
well
in
each
other
arms
once
more
on
the
days
when
she
detected
extreme
impatient
anguish
in
her
father
glance
she
referred
discreetly
to
the
frightful
situation
which
haunted
them
is
still
very
poorly
she
would
say
is
necessary
to
be
very
careful
and
i
dare
not
as
yet
talk
to
her
as
to
a
friend
but
i
have
hopes
there
are
times
when
she
takes
me
in
her
arms
and
presses
me
to
her
so
tightly
that
i
nearly
suffocate
while
her
eyes
fill
with
tears
at
other
times
it
is
true
she
becomes
harsh
and
unjust
accuses
me
of
not
loving
her
complains
indeed
that
nobody
has
ever
loved
her
you
see
father
one
must
be
very
kind
to
her
for
she
must
suffer
frightfully
thinking
as
she
does
that
she
will
never
more
be
able
to
content
her
heart
then
marc
in
his
excitement
cried
why
does
she
not
come
back
here
i
still
love
her
to
distraction
and
if
she
still
loved
me
we
might
be
so
happy
but
louise
in
a
sorrowful
gentle
caressing
way
placed
her
hand
over
his
mouth
no
papa
do
not
let
us
talk
of
that
i
did
wrong
to
begin
it
can
only
make
us
grieve
the
more
we
must
wait
i
am
now
beside
mamma
and
some
day
she
will
surely
see
that
only
we
two
love
her
she
will
listen
to
me
and
follow
me
at
other
times
the
girl
arrived
at
her
father
with
glittering
eyes
and
a
determined
bearing
as
if
she
had
just
emerged
from
some
contest
marc
noticed
it
and
said
to
her
have
been
disputing
with
your
grandmother
again
you
can
see
it
well
it
true
she
kept
me
for
a
good
hour
this
morning
trying
to
shame
and
terrify
me
about
my
first
communion
she
speaks
to
me
as
if
i
were
the
vilest
of
creatures
describes
to
me
all
the
abominable
tortures
of
hell
and
seems
quite
stupefied
and
scandalised
by
what
she
calls
my
inconceivable
obstinacy
at
this
marc
brightened
up
feeling
somewhat
reassured
he
had
so
greatly
feared
that
his
daughter
might
prove
as
weak
as
other
girls
and
was
happy
to
find
that
she
remained
so
firm
and
even
when
he
was
no
longer
present
to
support
her
but
emotion
came
upon
him
when
he
pictured
her
in
the
midst
of
persistent
attacks
scoldings
and
scenes
which
left
her
no
peace
poor
child
said
he
much
courage
you
need
those
constant
quarrels
must
be
very
painful
to
you
but
she
having
now
quite
recovered
her
composure
answered
smiling
oh
no
papa
i
am
too
respectful
with
grandmamma
to
quarrel
with
her
it
is
she
who
is
always
getting
angry
and
threatening
me
i
listen
to
her
very
deferentially
without
ever
making
the
slightest
interruption
and
when
she
has
quite
finished
after
beginning
two
or
three
times
afresh
i
content
myself
with
saying
very
gently
but
how
can
i
help
it
grandmamma
i
promised
papa
that
i
would
wait
until
i
was
twenty
before
deciding
whether
i
would
make
my
first
communion
or
not
and
as
i
swore
it
i
will
keep
my
word
you
see
i
never
depart
from
that
answer
i
know
it
by
heart
and
repeat
it
without
changing
a
word
that
makes
me
invincible
and
i
sometimes
begin
to
pity
poor
grandmamma
for
she
flies
into
such
a
temper
banging
the
door
in
my
face
as
soon
as
ever
i
begin
that
phrase
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
louise
suffered
from
that
perpetual
warfare
but
on
observing
her
father
delight
she
prettily
cast
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
added
see
you
may
be
quite
easy
i
am
really
your
daughter
nobody
will
ever
make
me
do
anything
when
i
have
decided
that
i
wo
do
it
the
girl
also
had
to
carry
on
a
battle
with
her
grandmother
in
order
to
continue
her
studies
resolved
as
she
was
to
devote
herself
to
the
teaching
profession
in
this
respect
she
fortunately
had
the
support
of
her
mother
who
regarded
the
future
as
being
very
uncertain
by
reason
of
the
increasing
avarice
which
madame
duparque
displayed
towards
her
family
the
old
lady
preferred
to
devote
her
little
fortune
to
pious
works
and
since
giving
an
asylum
to
geneviève
and
her
daughter
she
had
insisted
upon
their
paying
for
their
board
in
this
respect
wishing
to
annoy
marc
who
consequently
had
to
make
his
wife
a
considerable
allowance
out
of
his
meagre
salary
perhaps
madame
duparque
advised
in
this
matter
as
in
others
by
her
good
friends
those
masters
of
intrigue
whose
unseen
hands
pulled
every
string
had
hoped
that
marc
would
respond
by
a
refusal
and
that
a
scandal
would
ensue
but
he
could
live
on
very
little
and
he
consented
immediately
as
if
indeed
he
were
well
pleased
to
remain
the
paterfamilias
the
worker
and
supporter
of
those
who
belonged
to
him
and
although
straitened
circumstances
aggravated
his
solitude
the
meals
he
shared
with
mignot
becoming
extremely
frugal
he
did
not
suffer
for
it
was
sufficient
for
him
to
know
that
geneviève
had
appeared
moved
by
his
willingness
to
provide
for
her
and
that
she
found
in
this
pecuniary
question
a
motive
to
approve
of
louise
resolution
to
pursue
her
studies
in
order
to
ensure
her
future
thus
the
girl
who
had
already
obtained
her
elementary
certificate
continued
to
take
lessons
from
mademoiselle
mazeline
preparing
herself
for
the
superior
certificate
examination
which
circumstance
gave
rise
to
further
disputes
with
madame
duparque
who
was
exasperated
by
all
the
science
which
it
had
become
the
fashion
to
impart
to
young
girls
when
in
her
opinion
the
catechism
ought
to
have
sufficed
them
and
as
louise
always
answered
every
protest
in
her
extremely
deferential
manner
grandmamma
certainly
grandmamma
the
old
lady
grew
more
exasperated
than
ever
and
ended
by
picking
quarrels
with
geneviève
who
losing
patience
occasionally
answered
back
one
day
while
marc
was
listening
to
the
news
his
daughter
gave
him
he
became
quite
astonished
mamma
quarrel
with
grandmother
then
he
inquired
yes
papa
this
was
even
the
second
or
third
time
and
mamma
you
know
does
not
beat
about
the
bush
she
loses
her
temper
at
once
answers
back
in
a
loud
voice
and
then
goes
to
sulk
in
her
room
as
she
used
to
do
here
before
she
left
marc
listened
unwilling
to
give
utterance
to
the
secret
delight
the
hope
which
was
rising
within
him
does
madame
berthereau
take
part
in
these
discussions
he
resumed
grandmamma
berthereau
never
says
anything
she
sides
with
mamma
and
me
i
think
but
she
does
not
dare
to
support
us
openly
for
fear
of
worries
she
looks
very
sad
and
very
ailing
however
months
went
by
and
marc
saw
none
of
his
hopes
fulfilled
it
must
be
said
that
he
observed
great
discretion
in
questioning
his
daughter
for
it
was
repugnant
to
him
to
turn
her
into
a
kind
of
spy
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
himself
informed
of
everything
that
occurred
in
the
dismal
little
house
on
the
place
des
capucins
for
weeks
at
a
time
when
louise
ceased
to
speak
of
her
own
accord
marc
relapsed
into
anxious
ignorance
again
losing
all
hope
of
geneviève
return
his
only
consolation
then
lay
in
his
daughter
presence
beside
him
for
a
few
hours
on
thursdays
and
sundays
on
those
days
also
it
occasionally
happened
that
the
two
chums
of
the
beaumont
training
college
joseph
simon
and
sébastien
milhomme
arrived
at
the
maillebois
school
about
three
and
remained
there
until
six
happy
to
meet
their
friend
louise
who
like
themselves
was
all
aglow
with
youth
and
courage
and
faith
their
long
chats
were
enlivened
by
merry
laughter
which
left
some
gaiety
in
the
mournful
home
throughout
the
ensuing
week
marc
who
felt
comforted
by
these
meetings
at
times
requested
joseph
to
bring
his
sister
sarah
from
the
lehmanns
and
likewise
told
sébastien
that
he
would
be
happy
to
see
his
mother
madame
alexandre
accompany
him
the
schoolmaster
would
have
been
delighted
to
gather
a
number
of
worthy
folk
all
the
forces
of
the
future
around
him
at
those
affectionate
meetings
the
sympathies
of
former
times
revived
acquiring
a
strength
full
of
gentleness
and
gaiety
drawing
sébastien
and
sarah
joseph
and
louise
together
while
the
master
smiling
and
content
to
await
victory
at
the
hands
of
those
who
represented
allowed
good
mother
nature
beneficent
love
to
do
their
work
all
at
once
amidst
the
disheartening
delays
of
the
court
of
cassation
at
a
moment
when
courage
was
forsaking
david
and
marc
they
received
a
letter
from
delbos
acquainting
them
with
some
great
news
and
requesting
them
to
call
on
him
they
did
so
in
all
haste
the
great
news
destined
to
burst
on
beaumont
like
a
thunderclap
was
that
after
a
long
and
cruel
struggle
jacquin
the
diocesan
architect
and
foreman
of
the
jury
which
had
convicted
simon
had
at
last
felt
it
absolutely
necessary
to
relieve
his
conscience
very
pious
attending
confession
and
communion
strict
in
his
faith
and
in
all
respects
an
upright
man
jacquin
had
ended
by
feeling
anxious
with
respect
to
his
salvation
asking
himself
whether
as
he
was
in
possession
of
the
truth
it
was
possible
for
him
to
keep
silent
any
longer
without
incurring
the
risk
of
damnation
it
was
said
that
his
confessor
feeling
extremely
perplexed
not
daring
to
decide
the
question
himself
had
advised
him
to
consult
father
crabot
and
that
if
the
architect
had
remained
silent
several
months
longer
it
was
on
account
of
the
great
pressure
brought
to
bear
on
him
by
the
jesuit
who
in
the
name
of
the
church
political
interests
had
prevented
him
from
speaking
out
if
however
jacquin
was
unable
to
keep
his
terrible
secret
any
longer
it
was
precisely
by
reason
of
the
anguish
he
felt
as
a
christian
one
who
believed
that
the
christ
had
descended
upon
earth
to
ensure
the
triumph
of
truth
and
justice
and
the
knowledge
which
consumed
him
was
that
of
judge
gragnon
illegal
communication
to
the
jury
in
the
simon
case
of
a
document
unknown
either
to
the
prisoner
or
to
his
counsel
summoned
to
the
retiring
room
to
enlighten
the
jurymen
respecting
the
penalty
which
might
attach
to
their
verdict
the
judge
had
shown
them
a
letter
received
by
him
a
moment
previously
a
letter
from
simon
to
a
friend
followed
by
a
postscript
and
a
paraph
which
last
was
similar
to
the
one
on
the
tendered
as
evidence
it
was
to
this
same
letter
and
this
paraph
that
father
philibin
had
alluded
in
his
sensational
evidence
and
now
it
had
been
established
that
if
the
body
of
the
letter
was
indeed
in
simon
handwriting
the
postscript
and
the
paraph
were
assuredly
impudent
forgeries
in
fact
gross
ones
by
which
a
child
even
would
hardly
have
been
deceived
thus
david
and
marc
found
delbos
triumphant
did
i
tell
you
so
he
exclaimed
illegal
communication
is
now
proved
jacquin
has
written
to
the
president
of
the
court
of
cassation
confessing
the
truth
and
asking
to
be
heard
i
knew
that
the
letter
was
among
the
papers
of
the
case
for
gragnon
had
not
dared
to
destroy
it
but
how
difficult
it
was
to
have
it
produced
and
submitted
to
the
examination
of
experts
i
scented
a
forgery
i
felt
that
we
were
confronted
by
some
more
of
the
handiwork
of
that
terrible
father
philibin
ah
that
man
how
heavy
and
common
he
looked
but
the
more
i
fathom
the
affair
the
greater
do
his
talents
his
suppleness
artfulness
and
audacity
appear
he
was
not
content
with
tearing
off
the
stamped
corner
of
the
he
also
falsified
one
of
simon
letters
so
arranging
matters
that
this
letter
might
prevail
over
the
jury
at
the
last
moment
yes
assuredly
that
forgery
was
his
work
however
david
who
had
met
with
so
many
deceptions
retained
some
fears
are
you
sure
he
asked
jacquin
who
is
the
diocesan
architect
and
at
the
mercy
of
the
priests
will
remain
firm
to
the
end
sure
you
do
know
jacquin
he
is
not
at
the
mercy
of
the
priests
he
is
one
of
the
few
christians
who
are
governed
solely
by
their
consciences
some
extraordinary
things
have
been
told
me
respecting
his
interviews
with
father
crabot
at
first
the
jesuit
spoke
in
a
domineering
way
in
the
name
of
his
imperative
deity
who
forgives
and
even
glorifies
the
worst
deeds
when
the
salvation
of
the
church
is
in
question
but
jacquin
answered
back
in
the
name
of
a
good
and
equitable
god
the
god
of
the
innocent
and
the
just
who
tolerates
neither
error
nor
falsehood
nor
crime
i
wish
i
had
been
present
that
battle
between
the
mere
believer
and
the
political
agent
of
a
crumbling
religion
must
have
been
a
fine
spectacle
however
i
have
been
told
that
it
was
the
jesuit
who
ended
by
humbling
himself
and
entreating
jacquin
though
he
failed
to
prevent
him
from
doing
his
duty
the
same
marc
interrupted
took
jacquin
a
very
long
time
to
relieve
his
conscience
no
doubt
i
do
say
that
his
duty
became
manifest
to
him
at
once
for
years
however
he
did
not
know
that
president
communication
was
illegal
almost
all
jurors
are
similarly
situated
they
know
nothing
of
the
law
and
take
as
correct
whatever
the
chief
magistrates
may
say
to
them
when
jacquin
learnt
the
truth
he
hesitated
evidently
and
for
years
and
years
went
about
with
a
burden
on
his
conscience
saying
nothing
however
for
fear
of
scandal
we
shall
never
know
the
sufferings
and
the
struggles
of
that
man
who
went
regularly
to
confession
and
communion
ever
terrified
by
the
thought
that
he
was
perhaps
damning
himself
for
all
eternity
however
i
can
assure
you
that
when
he
became
certain
that
the
document
was
a
forgery
he
no
longer
hesitated
he
resolved
to
speak
out
even
if
by
doing
so
he
should
cause
the
cathedral
of
saint
maxence
to
fall
for
on
no
account
was
he
disposed
to
disregard
what
he
deemed
to
be
his
duty
towards
god
then
delbos
like
a
man
who
after
long
efforts
was
at
last
reaching
his
goal
gaily
summed
up
the
situation
and
david
and
marc
went
off
radiant
with
hope
but
how
great
was
the
commotion
in
beaumont
when
jacquin
letter
to
the
court
of
cassation
his
confession
and
his
offer
of
evidence
became
known
judge
gragnon
hastily
closed
his
doors
refusing
to
answer
the
journalists
who
applied
to
him
wrapping
himself
as
it
were
in
haughty
silence
he
was
no
longer
a
jovial
sarcastic
sportsman
and
pursuer
of
pretty
girls
people
said
that
he
was
quite
overwhelmed
by
the
blow
which
had
thus
fallen
on
him
on
the
eve
of
his
retirement
from
the
bench
at
the
moment
when
he
was
expecting
to
receive
the
collar
of
a
commandership
in
the
legion
of
honour
of
recent
years
his
wife
the
once
beautiful
madame
gragnon
having
passed
the
age
for
reading
poetry
with
general
jarousse
young
officers
had
decided
to
occupy
herself
in
converting
him
pointing
out
to
him
no
doubt
all
the
advantages
of
a
pious
old
age
and
he
followed
her
to
confession
and
communion
giving
a
lofty
example
of
fervent
catholicism
which
explained
the
passionate
zeal
with
which
father
crabot
had
tried
to
prevent
jacquin
from
relieving
his
conscience
the
jesuit
indeed
wished
to
save
gragnon
a
believer
of
great
importance
and
influence
of
whom
the
church
was
very
proud
moreover
the
whole
judicial
world
of
beaumont
sided
with
the
presiding
judge
defending
the
conviction
and
condemnation
of
simon
as
its
own
work
its
masterpiece
which
none
might
touch
without
committing
high
treason
against
the
country
behind
that
fine
assumption
of
indignation
however
there
was
base
shivering
dread
dread
of
the
galleys
dread
lest
the
gendarmes
should
set
their
heavy
hands
some
evening
on
the
black
or
red
robes
furred
with
ermine
whose
wearers
had
imagined
themselves
to
be
above
the
laws
the
handsome
raoul
de
la
bissonnière
was
no
longer
public
prosecutor
at
beaumont
he
had
been
transferred
to
the
neighbouring
appeal
court
of
mornay
where
he
was
growing
embittered
by
his
failure
to
secure
a
post
in
paris
in
spite
of
all
his
suppleness
and
skill
under
every
succeeding
government
on
the
other
hand
investigating
magistrate
daix
had
not
quitted
the
town
where
he
had
been
promoted
to
the
rank
of
counsellor
but
he
was
still
tortured
by
his
terrible
wife
whose
ambition
and
craving
for
luxury
made
his
home
a
hell
it
was
said
that
daix
seized
with
remorse
like
jacquin
was
on
the
point
of
throwing
off
his
acrimonious
authority
and
relating
how
he
had
cowardly
yielded
to
her
representations
and
sent
simon
for
trial
at
the
very
moment
when
from
lack
of
proof
he
was
about
to
stay
further
proceedings
thus
the
palais
de
justice
was
all
agog
swept
by
gusts
of
fear
and
anger
pending
the
advent
of
the
cataclysm
which
would
at
last
annihilate
the
ancient
framework
of
human
justice
the
political
world
of
beaumont
was
no
less
shaken
no
less
distracted
lemarrois
the
deputy
and
mayor
felt
that
the
radical
republican
views
he
had
long
professed
were
losing
their
hold
on
the
electorate
and
that
he
might
be
swept
away
in
this
supreme
crisis
which
was
bringing
the
living
strength
of
the
people
forward
thus
in
the
of
his
intelligent
wife
the
evolution
towards
reactionary
courses
became
more
pronounced
among
those
now
often
seen
there
was
marcilly
once
the
representative
of
the
intellectual
young
men
the
hope
of
the
french
mind
but
now
reduced
to
a
kind
of
political
paralysis
bewildered
by
his
inability
to
detect
in
which
direction
lay
his
personal
interests
and
forced
to
inaction
by
the
haunting
fear
that
if
he
should
act
in
any
particular
way
he
might
not
be
then
another
visitor
was
general
jarousse
who
though
a
mere
cipher
now
showed
himself
aggressive
spurred
on
it
seemed
by
the
perpetual
nagging
of
his
little
dusky
withered
wife
and
prefect
hennebise
also
called
at
times
accompanied
by
the
placid
madame
hennebise
each
desiring
to
live
at
peace
with
everybody
such
being
indeed
the
wish
of
the
government
whose
motto
was
difficulties
only
handshakes
and
smiles
there
was
great
fear
of
elections
as
the
department
was
so
enfevered
by
the
revival
of
the
simon
affair
and
marcilly
and
even
lemarrois
though
they
did
not
own
it
had
resolved
to
ally
themselves
secretly
with
hector
de
sanglebœuf
and
their
other
reactionary
colleagues
in
order
to
overcome
the
socialist
candidates
particularly
delbos
whose
success
would
become
certain
should
he
succeed
in
his
efforts
on
behalf
of
the
innocent
prisoner
all
this
tended
to
the
confusion
which
broke
out
directly
people
heard
of
the
intervention
of
jacquin
by
which
the
revision
of
the
case
was
rendered
inevitable
the
simonists
triumphed
and
for
a
few
days
the
seemed
crushed
nothing
else
was
talked
about
on
the
aristocratic
promenade
of
les
jaffres
and
though
petit
in
order
to
inspirit
its
readers
declared
every
morning
that
the
revision
of
the
case
would
be
refused
by
a
majority
of
two
to
one
the
friends
of
the
church
remained
plunged
in
desolation
for
private
estimates
indicated
quite
a
different
result
meantime
the
delight
shown
among
the
university
men
was
very
temperate
nearly
all
of
them
were
simonists
but
they
had
hoped
in
vain
so
often
that
they
now
scarcely
dared
to
rejoice
rector
forbes
was
relieved
to
think
that
he
would
soon
be
rid
of
the
case
of
that
maillebois
schoolmaster
marc
froment
about
whom
he
was
so
frequently
assailed
by
the
reactionary
forces
in
spite
of
his
desire
to
meddle
with
nothing
forbes
had
been
obliged
to
confer
with
le
barazer
respecting
the
necessity
of
an
execution
and
le
barazer
whose
own
powers
of
resistance
were
exhausted
foresaw
the
moment
when
policy
would
compel
him
to
sacrifice
marc
he
had
even
mentioned
it
to
salvan
who
had
shown
deep
grief
at
the
announcement
when
however
marc
came
to
him
with
the
great
news
that
made
revision
certain
the
man
revived
to
gaiety
and
gave
his
friend
quite
a
triumphal
greeting
he
embraced
him
and
then
told
him
of
the
threatening
danger
from
which
the
favourable
decision
of
the
court
of
cassation
alone
would
save
him
revision
should
not
be
granted
my
dear
fellow
he
said
would
certainly
be
revoked
for
this
time
you
are
deeply
involved
in
the
affair
and
all
the
reactionaries
demand
your
head
however
the
news
you
bring
pleases
me
for
you
are
at
last
victorious
and
our
secular
schools
triumph
need
to
do
so
marc
replied
conquests
over
error
and
ignorance
are
still
so
slight
in
spite
of
all
your
efforts
to
endow
the
region
with
good
masters
a
good
many
lives
will
be
needed
but
no
matter
we
are
marching
on
and
we
shall
reach
the
goal
salvan
responded
with
his
usual
gesture
expressive
of
unshakable
hope
perhaps
the
best
proof
that
marc
was
really
victorious
was
found
by
him
in
the
eager
manner
with
which
handsome
mauraisin
the
elementary
inspector
rushed
towards
him
that
same
day
just
as
he
had
quitted
salvan
my
dear
monsieur
froment
i
am
very
pleased
to
meet
you
the
inspector
exclaimed
see
each
other
so
seldom
apart
from
the
requirements
of
our
duties
since
the
revival
of
the
affair
mortal
anxiety
had
taken
possession
of
mauraisin
who
at
an
earlier
stage
had
openly
sided
with
the
convinced
as
he
then
was
that
the
priests
never
allowed
themselves
to
be
beaten
but
now
if
they
should
lose
the
game
how
would
he
be
able
to
save
himself
the
idea
of
not
being
on
the
winning
side
distressed
him
greatly
though
nobody
was
passing
in
the
street
he
leant
towards
marc
to
whisper
in
his
ear
my
part
you
know
my
dear
froment
i
never
doubted
simon
innocence
i
was
convinced
of
it
at
bottom
only
it
is
so
necessary
for
public
men
like
ourselves
to
remain
prudent
is
that
not
so
for
a
long
time
past
mauraisin
had
been
keeping
his
eye
on
post
hoping
to
secure
it
in
due
course
and
in
view
of
a
possible
triumph
of
the
simonists
he
felt
it
would
be
as
well
to
side
with
them
on
the
eve
of
victory
but
as
that
victory
was
not
yet
quite
certain
he
did
not
wish
to
exhibit
himself
in
their
company
so
he
speedily
took
leave
of
marc
whispering
as
he
pressed
his
hand
for
the
last
time
triumph
will
be
a
triumph
for
all
of
us
on
returning
to
maillebois
marc
perceived
a
change
there
also
darras
the
whom
he
chanced
to
meet
did
not
rest
content
with
bowing
to
him
discreetly
according
to
his
wont
but
stopped
him
in
the
middle
of
the
high
street
and
talked
and
laughed
with
him
for
more
than
ten
minutes
he
darras
had
been
a
simonist
at
the
outset
but
since
he
had
lost
his
position
as
mayor
he
had
put
his
flag
in
his
pocket
and
made
it
a
habit
to
bolt
his
door
before
divulging
what
he
thought
if
therefore
he
now
openly
chatted
with
marc
it
must
have
been
because
simon
acquittal
seemed
to
him
a
certainty
as
it
happened
philis
the
new
mayor
went
by
at
that
moment
gliding
swiftly
over
the
pavement
with
his
head
bent
and
his
eyes
darting
furtive
glances
around
him
this
amused
darras
who
with
a
knowing
look
at
marc
exclaimed
pleases
some
displeases
others
is
it
not
so
monsieur
froment
we
all
have
our
turns
indeed
a
great
change
in
public
opinion
gradually
became
manifest
day
by
day
for
several
weeks
marc
observed
the
increasing
favour
of
the
cause
he
defended
however
the
decisive
importance
of
the
success
already
achieved
became
most
manifest
to
him
when
he
received
a
letter
from
baron
nathan
who
was
again
staying
at
la
désirade
and
who
asked
him
to
call
there
with
respect
to
a
prize
for
the
communal
school
which
he
the
baron
desired
to
found
although
nathan
on
two
or
three
occasions
previously
had
given
a
hundred
francs
or
so
to
be
distributed
in
deposits
among
the
best
pupils
marc
felt
that
the
offer
of
a
prize
at
that
juncture
was
only
a
pretext
so
he
repaired
to
la
désirade
full
of
wonder
and
curiosity
he
had
not
returned
thither
since
the
now
distant
day
when
he
had
accompanied
david
on
his
attempt
to
interest
the
baron
in
the
cause
of
his
accused
and
imprisoned
brother
marc
remembered
the
most
trifling
details
of
that
visit
the
skilful
manner
in
which
the
triumphant
jew
a
king
of
finance
and
the
of
a
sanglebœuf
had
shaken
off
the
poor
jew
on
whom
public
execration
had
fallen
and
now
on
returning
to
la
désirade
marc
found
that
its
majesty
and
beauty
had
increased
recently
a
million
of
francs
had
been
spent
on
new
terraces
and
new
fountains
which
imparted
an
aspect
of
sovereign
grandeur
to
the
parterres
in
front
of
the
château
encompassed
by
plashing
waters
and
a
galaxy
of
marble
nymphs
he
ended
by
reaching
the
steps
where
two
tall
lackeys
in
liveries
of
green
and
gold
were
waiting
on
one
of
them
conducting
him
to
a
little
where
he
was
requested
to
wait
he
remained
alone
for
a
moment
and
heard
a
confused
murmur
of
voices
in
some
neighbouring
room
then
two
doors
were
shut
all
became
quiet
and
finally
baron
nathan
entered
with
outstretched
hand
me
for
having
disturbed
you
my
dear
monsieur
froment
he
said
i
know
how
devoted
you
are
to
your
pupils
and
i
wish
to
double
the
sum
which
i
have
been
giving
you
of
recent
years
you
are
aware
that
my
ideas
are
broad
that
i
desire
to
reward
merit
wherever
it
may
be
found
apart
from
all
political
and
religious
questions
yes
i
make
no
difference
between
the
congregational
and
the
secular
schools
i
am
for
all
france
short
and
somewhat
bent
with
a
yellow
face
a
bald
cranium
and
a
large
nose
resembling
the
beak
of
a
bird
of
prey
nathan
went
on
talking
while
marc
gazed
at
him
the
schoolmaster
knew
that
of
recent
times
the
baron
had
still
further
enriched
himself
by
stealing
a
hundred
millions
of
francs
in
a
colonial
affair
a
deed
of
rapine
the
huge
booty
of
which
he
had
been
obliged
to
share
with
a
catholic
bank
and
he
had
now
plunged
into
fierce
reaction
for
as
new
millions
were
added
to
his
former
ones
he
became
more
and
more
convinced
that
priests
and
soldiers
were
needed
to
enable
him
to
retain
his
wealth
he
was
no
longer
content
with
having
wormed
his
way
through
his
daughter
into
the
ancient
family
of
the
sanglebœufs
he
now
absolutely
denied
his
race
openly
displaying
a
ferocious
showing
himself
a
monarchist
a
militarist
a
respectful
friend
of
those
who
in
olden
time
had
burnt
the
jews
nevertheless
and
this
astonished
marc
nathan
whatever
his
wealth
still
retained
much
of
his
racial
humility
a
dread
of
the
persecutions
which
had
fallen
on
his
ancestors
appeared
in
his
anxious
eyes
as
they
glanced
at
the
doors
as
if
he
wished
to
be
ready
to
slip
under
a
table
at
the
slightest
sign
of
danger
it
is
settled
he
said
after
all
sorts
of
involved
explanations
you
will
dispose
of
these
two
hundred
francs
yourself
as
you
please
for
i
have
perfect
confidence
in
your
sagacity
marc
thanked
him
but
still
failed
to
understand
the
meaning
of
it
all
even
a
politic
desire
to
remain
on
good
terms
with
everybody
a
wish
to
be
among
the
simonists
if
they
should
win
the
battle
did
not
explain
that
flattering
and
useless
appointment
that
reception
at
la
désirade
however
just
as
the
schoolmaster
was
retiring
there
came
an
explanation
baron
nathan
having
accompanied
him
to
the
door
detained
him
there
and
with
a
keen
smile
which
seemed
prompted
by
a
sudden
inspiration
exclaimed
dear
monsieur
froment
i
am
going
to
be
very
indiscreet
when
i
was
informed
of
your
arrival
just
now
i
happened
to
be
with
somebody
an
important
personage
who
exclaimed
monsieur
froment
oh
i
should
be
so
pleased
to
have
a
conversation
with
him
a
cry
from
the
heart
in
fact
the
baron
paused
waiting
a
few
seconds
in
the
hope
that
he
would
be
questioned
then
as
marc
remained
silent
he
laughed
and
said
in
a
jesting
way
would
be
greatly
surprised
if
i
told
you
who
the
personage
was
and
as
the
schoolmaster
still
looked
grave
remaining
on
the
defensive
nathan
blurted
out
everything
was
father
crabot
you
did
not
expect
that
eh
but
he
came
to
lunch
here
this
morning
as
you
may
know
he
honours
my
daughter
with
his
affection
and
is
a
frequent
visitor
here
well
he
expressed
to
me
a
desire
to
have
some
conversation
with
you
setting
aside
all
matters
of
opinion
he
is
a
man
of
the
rarest
merit
why
should
you
refuse
to
see
him
to
this
marc
who
at
last
understood
the
object
of
the
appointment
given
him
and
whose
curiosity
was
more
and
more
aroused
quietly
responded
i
do
refuse
to
see
father
crabot
if
he
has
anything
to
say
to
me
i
will
listen
to
him
willingly
good
very
good
exclaimed
the
baron
delighted
with
the
success
of
his
diplomacy
will
go
to
tell
him
again
the
two
doors
opened
one
after
the
other
and
a
confused
murmur
of
voices
once
more
reached
the
little
then
all
relapsed
into
silence
and
marc
was
left
waiting
for
some
time
having
at
last
drawn
near
to
the
window
he
saw
the
persons
whose
voices
he
had
heard
step
on
to
the
adjoining
terrace
and
he
recognised
hector
de
sanglebœuf
and
his
wife
the
still
beautiful
léa
accompanied
by
their
good
friend
the
marchioness
de
boise
who
though
her
birthday
was
now
past
remained
a
buxom
blonde
the
ruins
of
whose
beauty
were
magnificent
nathan
likewise
appeared
and
one
could
also
divine
that
father
crabot
was
standing
at
the
glass
door
of
the
grand
still
talking
to
his
hosts
who
left
him
in
possession
of
the
apartment
in
order
that
he
might
receive
the
visitor
as
if
he
were
at
home
the
marchioness
de
boise
seemed
particularly
amused
by
the
incident
though
she
had
originally
resolved
to
disappear
as
soon
as
she
should
be
fifty
unwilling
as
she
was
to
impose
too
old
a
mistress
on
hector
she
had
ended
by
making
the
château
her
permanent
home
besides
people
said
that
she
was
still
adorable
so
why
should
she
not
continue
to
ensure
the
happiness
of
the
husband
whose
marriage
she
had
so
wisely
negotiated
and
of
the
wife
whose
tender
friend
she
was
thus
age
might
come
but
happiness
still
reigned
at
la
désirade
amid
its
luxurious
appointments
and
father
crabot
discreet
smiles
and
pious
benisons
as
marc
looked
out
of
the
window
and
observed
the
terrible
sanglebœuf
waving
his
arms
and
shaking
his
carroty
head
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
clerical
champion
with
the
heavy
face
and
the
narrow
stubborn
brow
was
deploring
the
practice
of
so
much
diplomacy
the
honour
which
father
crabot
accorded
to
a
petty
anarchical
schoolmaster
by
thus
receiving
him
sanglebœuf
had
never
once
fought
in
his
cuirassier
days
but
he
always
talked
of
sabring
people
although
the
marchioness
after
securing
his
election
as
a
deputy
had
made
him
rally
to
the
republic
in
accordance
with
the
pope
express
commands
he
still
and
ever
prated
about
his
regiment
and
flew
into
a
passion
whenever
there
was
any
question
of
the
flag
indeed
he
would
have
committed
blunder
upon
blunder
had
it
not
been
for
that
intelligent
marchioness
and
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
she
gave
for
remaining
near
him
again
on
this
occasion
she
had
to
intervene
and
lead
him
and
his
wife
away
walking
slowly
between
them
in
the
direction
of
the
park
and
showing
the
while
much
gaiety
of
mien
and
motherliness
of
manner
towards
both
baron
nathan
however
had
quickly
returned
to
the
grand
the
glass
door
of
which
he
closed
and
almost
immediately
afterwards
marc
heard
himself
called
follow
me
my
dear
monsieur
froment
the
baron
led
him
through
a
then
having
opened
the
door
drew
back
and
ushered
him
in
delighted
it
seemed
with
the
strange
part
he
was
playing
his
body
bowed
in
a
posture
which
again
showed
racial
humility
reviving
in
the
triumphant
king
of
finance
enter
you
are
awaited
nathan
himself
did
not
enter
but
discreetly
closed
the
door
and
disappeared
while
marc
amazed
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
father
crabot
who
stood
in
his
long
black
gown
in
the
centre
of
the
spacious
and
sumptuous
room
hung
with
crimson
and
gold
a
silence
followed
the
jesuit
whose
noble
mien
whose
lofty
and
elegant
carriage
marc
well
remembered
seemed
to
him
to
have
greatly
aged
his
hair
had
whitened
and
his
countenance
was
ravaged
by
all
the
terrible
anxiety
he
had
experienced
for
some
time
past
but
the
caressing
charm
of
his
voice
its
grave
and
captivating
modulations
had
remained
circumstances
have
brought
us
both
to
this
friendly
house
monsieur
said
he
will
perhaps
excuse
me
for
having
prompted
an
interview
which
i
have
long
desired
i
am
aware
of
your
merits
i
can
render
homage
to
all
convictions
when
they
are
sincere
loyal
and
courageous
he
went
on
speaking
in
this
strain
for
some
minutes
heaping
praises
on
his
adversary
as
if
to
daze
him
and
win
him
over
but
the
device
was
too
familiar
and
too
childish
to
influence
marc
who
after
bowing
politely
quietly
awaited
the
rest
striving
even
to
conceal
his
curiosity
for
only
some
very
grave
reason
could
have
induced
such
a
man
as
father
crabot
to
run
the
risk
of
such
an
interview
deplorable
it
is
the
jesuit
at
last
exclaimed
the
misfortunes
of
the
times
should
separate
minds
so
fit
to
understand
each
other
some
of
the
victims
of
our
dissensions
are
really
to
be
pitied
for
instance
there
is
president
gragnon
then
as
a
hasty
gesture
escaped
the
schoolmaster
he
broke
off
in
order
to
interpolate
a
brief
explanation
name
him
he
said
i
know
him
well
he
is
a
penitent
of
mine
a
friend
a
loftier
soul
a
more
upright
and
loyal
heart
could
be
found
nowhere
you
are
aware
of
the
frightful
position
in
which
he
finds
himself
that
charge
of
prevarication
which
means
the
collapse
of
his
entire
judicial
career
he
no
longer
sleeps
you
would
pity
him
if
you
were
to
witness
his
sufferings
footnote
the
word
is
used
in
a
legal
sense
as
signifying
the
betrayal
of
the
interests
of
one
party
in
a
lawsuit
by
collusion
with
the
other

the
french
call
this
at
last
marc
understood
everything
they
wished
to
save
gragnon
who
only
yesterday
had
been
an
son
of
the
church
which
felt
it
would
be
grievously
maimed
if
he
should
be
struck
down
can
understand
his
torment
marc
finally
answered
he
is
paying
the
penalty
of
his
transgression
a
judge
must
know
the
laws
and
the
illegal
communication
of
which
he
was
guilty
had
frightful
consequences
no
i
assure
you
he
acted
in
all
simplicity
the
jesuit
exclaimed
letter
which
he
received
at
the
last
moment
seemed
to
him
without
importance
he
still
had
it
in
his
hand
when
he
was
summoned
to
the
jurymen
retiring
room
and
he
no
longer
remembers
how
it
happened
that
he
showed
it
to
them
marc
gave
a
little
shrug
of
the
shoulders
he
responded
will
only
have
to
tell
that
to
the
new
judges
if
there
should
be
a
new
trial
in
any
case
i
hardly
understand
your
intervention
with
me
i
can
do
nothing
do
not
say
that
monsieur
we
know
how
great
your
power
is
however
modest
your
position
may
seem
to
be
and
that
is
why
i
thought
of
applying
to
you
throughout
this
affair
all
thought
and
action
and
willpower
have
been
centred
in
you
you
are
the
friend
of
the
simon
family
which
will
do
whatever
you
advise
so
come
will
you
not
spare
an
unfortunate
man
whose
ruin
is
by
no
means
indispensable
for
your
cause
father
crabot
joined
his
hands
and
entreated
his
adversary
so
fervently
that
the
latter
again
all
astonishment
wondered
what
could
be
the
real
reason
of
such
a
desperate
appeal
such
clumsy
and
impolitic
insistence
did
the
jesuit
feel
that
the
cause
he
defended
was
lost
did
he
possess
private
information
which
made
him
regard
revision
as
a
certainty
in
any
case
matters
had
come
to
such
a
pass
that
he
was
now
ready
to
leave
something
to
the
fire
in
order
to
save
the
rest
he
abandoned
his
former
creatures
who
were
now
too
deeply
compromised
that
poor
brother
fulgence
had
a
befogged
unbalanced
mind
spoilt
by
excessive
pride
disastrous
consequences
had
attended
his
actions
that
unfortunate
father
philibin
had
always
been
full
of
faith
no
doubt
but
then
there
were
many
gaps
in
his
nature
he
was
deplorably
deficient
in
moral
sense
as
for
the
disastrous
brother
gorgias
father
crabot
cast
him
off
entirely
he
was
one
of
those
adventurous
erring
sons
of
the
church
who
become
its
curse
and
if
the
jesuit
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
admit
the
possible
innocence
of
simon
he
was
at
least
not
far
from
believing
brother
gorgias
capable
of
every
crime
see
my
dear
sir
he
said
do
not
deceive
myself
but
there
are
other
men
whom
it
would
be
really
cruel
to
visit
too
severely
for
mere
errors
help
us
to
save
them
and
we
will
requite
the
service
by
ceasing
to
contend
with
you
in
other
matters
never
had
marc
so
plainly
realised
his
strength
the
very
strength
of
truth
he
answered
engaging
in
quite
a
long
discussion
desirous
as
he
was
of
forming
a
final
opinion
with
respect
to
the
merits
of
father
crabot
and
his
stupefaction
increased
as
he
fathomed
the
extraordinary
poverty
of
argument
the
arrant
clumsiness
too
which
accompanied
the
vanity
of
this
man
accustomed
never
to
be
contradicted
was
this
then
the
profound
diplomatist
whose
crafty
genius
was
feared
by
everybody
and
the
presence
of
whose
hand
was
suspected
in
every
incident
as
if
indeed
he
ruled
the
world
in
this
interview
which
had
been
prepared
so
clumsily
he
showed
himself
a
poor
bewildered
individual
committing
himself
far
more
than
was
necessary
even
incompetent
to
defend
his
faith
against
one
who
was
merely
possessed
of
sense
and
logic
a
mediocrity
that
was
what
he
was
a
mediocrity
with
a
of
social
gifts
which
imposed
on
the
man
in
the
street
his
real
strength
lay
in
the
stupidity
of
his
flock
the
submissiveness
with
which
the
faithful
bent
low
before
his
statements
which
they
regarded
as
being
beyond
discussion
and
marc
ended
by
understanding
that
he
was
confronted
by
a
mere
show
jesuit
one
of
those
who
for
decorative
purposes
were
allowed
by
their
order
to
thrust
themselves
forward
shine
and
charm
while
in
the
rear
other
jesuits
such
for
instance
as
father
poirier
the
provincial
installed
at
rozan
whose
name
was
never
mentioned
directed
everything
like
unknown
sovereign
rulers
hidden
away
in
distant
places
of
retreat
father
crabot
however
was
shrewd
enough
to
understand
at
last
that
he
was
taking
the
wrong
course
with
marc
and
he
thereupon
did
what
he
could
to
recover
his
lost
ground
the
whole
ended
by
an
exchange
of
frigid
courtesies
then
baron
nathan
who
must
have
remained
listening
outside
the
door
reappeared
looking
also
very
discomfited
with
only
one
remaining
anxiety
which
was
to
rid
la
désirade
as
soon
as
possible
of
the
presence
of
that
petty
schoolmaster
who
was
such
a
fool
that
he
could
not
even
understand
his
own
interests
he
escorted
him
to
the
terrace
and
watched
his
departure
and
marc
as
he
went
his
way
among
the
parterres
the
plashing
waters
and
the
marble
nymphs
again
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
marchioness
de
boise
laughing
affectionately
with
her
good
friends
hector
and
léa
as
all
three
strolled
slowly
under
the
foliage
on
the
evening
of
that
same
day
marc
repaired
to
the
rue
du
trou
having
given
david
an
appointment
at
the
lehmanns
he
found
them
all
in
a
state
of
delirious
joy
for
a
telegram
from
a
friend
in
paris
had
just
informed
them
that
the
court
of
cassation
had
at
last
pronounced
an
unanimous
judgment
quashing
the
proceedings
of
beaumont
and
sending
simon
before
the
assize
court
of
rozan
for
marc
this
news
was
like
a
flash
of
light
and
what
he
had
regarded
as
father
crabot
folly
seemed
to
him
more
excusable
than
before
the
jesuit
had
evidently
been
well
informed
that
judgment
had
been
known
to
him
and
revision
becoming
a
certainty
he
had
simply
wished
to
save
those
whom
he
thought
might
still
be
saved
and
now
at
the
lehmanns
all
were
weeping
with
joy
for
the
long
calamity
was
over
wildly
did
joseph
and
sarah
kiss
rachel
their
poor
aged
and
exhausted
mother
both
children
and
wife
were
intoxicated
by
the
thought
of
the
return
of
the
father
the
husband
for
whom
they
had
mourned
and
longed
so
much
outrage
and
torture
were
all
forgotten
for
acquittal
was
now
certain
nobody
doubted
it
either
at
maillebois
or
at
beaumont
and
david
and
marc
those
two
brave
workers
in
the
cause
of
justice
also
embraced
each
other
drawn
together
by
a
great
impulse
of
affection
and
hope
but
as
the
days
went
by
anxiety
arose
once
more
at
the
penal
settlement
yonder
simon
had
fallen
so
dangerously
ill
that
for
a
long
time
yet
it
would
be
impossible
to
bring
him
back
to
france
months
and
months
might
elapse
before
the
new
trial
would
begin
at
rozan
and
thus
all
necessary
time
was
given
to
the
spirit
of
injustice
to
revive
and
spread
once
more
in
the
midst
of
mendacity
and
the
multitude
cowardly
ignorance
iii
during
the
year
which
followed
a
year
full
of
anxiety
uneasiness
and
contention
the
church
made
a
supreme
effort
to
regain
her
power
never
had
her
position
been
more
critical
more
threatened
than
during
that
desperate
battle
by
which
the
duration
of
her
empire
might
be
prolonged
for
a
century
or
perhaps
two
centuries
should
she
win
it
in
order
to
do
so
it
was
necessary
she
should
continue
to
educate
and
train
the
youth
of
france
retain
her
sway
over
children
and
women
and
avail
herself
of
the
ignorance
of
the
humble
in
such
wise
as
to
mould
them
and
make
them
all
error
credulity
and
submissiveness
even
as
she
needed
them
to
be
in
order
to
reign
the
day
when
she
might
be
forbidden
to
teach
when
her
schools
would
be
closed
and
disappear
would
prove
for
her
the
beginning
of
the
end
when
she
would
be
annihilated
amidst
a
new
and
free
people
which
would
have
grown
up
outside
the
pale
of
her
falsehoods
cultivating
an
ideal
of
reason
and
humanity
and
the
hour
was
a
grave
one
that
simon
affair
with
the
expected
return
and
triumph
of
the
innocent
prisoner
might
deal
a
most
terrible
blow
to
the
congregational
schools
by
glorifying
the
secular
ones
meantime
father
crabot
who
wished
to
save
judge
gragnon
was
so
compromised
himself
that
he
had
disappeared
from
society
and
hidden
himself
pale
and
trembling
in
his
lonely
cell
father
philibin
who
had
been
consigned
to
an
italian
convent
was
spending
the
remainder
of
his
days
in
penitence
unless
indeed
he
were
already
dead
brother
fulgence
removed
by
his
superiors
in
punishment
for
the
discredit
which
had
fallen
on
his
school
a
third
of
whose
pupils
had
already
quitted
it
was
said
to
have
fallen
dangerously
ill
in
the
distant
department
whither
he
had
been
sent
finally
brother
gorgias
had
fled
fearing
that
he
might
be
arrested
and
feeling
that
his
principals
were
forsaking
him
willing
to
sacrifice
him
as
an
expiatory
victim
and
this
flight
had
increased
the
anxiety
of
the
defenders
of
the
church
who
lived
only
with
the
thought
of
fighting
a
last
and
merciless
battle
when
the
simon
affair
should
come
before
the
rozan
assize
court
marc
also
while
lamenting
simon
ill
health
which
delayed
his
return
to
france
was
preparing
for
that
same
battle
fully
realising
its
decisive
importance
almost
every
thursday
sometimes
with
david
sometimes
alone
he
repaired
to
beaumont
calling
first
on
delbos
to
whom
he
made
suggestions
and
whom
he
questioned
about
the
slightest
incidents
of
the
week
and
afterwards
he
went
to
see
salvan
who
kept
him
informed
of
the
state
of
public
opinion
every
fluctuation
of
which
set
all
classes
in
the
town
agog
in
this
wise
then
one
thursday
marc
paid
a
visit
to
the
training
college
and
on
quitting
it
went
down
the
avenue
des
jaffres
where
close
to
the
cathedral
of
maxence
he
was
upset
by
a
most
unexpected
meeting
on
one
of
the
deserted
sidewalks
of
the
avenue
at
a
spot
where
scarcely
anybody
was
ever
seen
after
four
he
perceived
geneviève
seated
on
a
bench
and
looking
very
downcast
weary
and
lonely
in
the
cold
shadow
falling
from
the
cathedral
whose
proximity
encouraged
the
moss
to
grow
on
the
trunks
of
the
old
elms
for
a
moment
marc
remained
motionless
quite
thunderstruck
he
had
met
his
wife
in
maillebois
at
long
intervals
but
invariably
in
the
company
of
madame
duparque
and
on
those
occasions
she
had
passed
through
the
streets
with
eyes
on
her
way
no
doubt
to
some
devotional
exercise
this
time
however
they
found
themselves
face
to
face
in
perfect
solitude
parted
by
none
geneviève
had
seen
him
and
was
looking
at
him
with
an
expression
in
which
he
fancied
he
could
detect
great
suffering
and
an
unacknowledged
craving
for
help
thus
he
went
forward
and
even
ventured
to
seat
himself
on
the
same
bench
though
at
some
little
distance
from
her
for
fear
lest
he
should
frighten
her
and
drive
her
away
deep
silence
reigned
it
was
june
and
the
sun
descending
towards
the
horizon
in
a
vast
stretch
of
limpid
sky
transpierced
the
surrounding
foliage
with
slender
golden
darts
while
little
wandering
zephyrs
already
began
to
cool
the
warm
afternoon
atmosphere
and
marc
still
looked
at
his
wife
saying
nothing
but
feeling
deeply
moved
as
he
noticed
that
she
had
grown
thinner
and
paler
as
if
after
a
serious
illness
her
face
crowned
by
splendid
fair
hair
and
with
large
eyes
which
once
had
been
all
passion
and
gaiety
had
not
only
become
emaciated
but
had
acquired
an
expression
of
ardent
anxiety
the
torment
of
a
parching
thirst
which
nothing
could
assuage
her
eyelids
quivered
and
two
tears
which
she
vainly
tried
to
force
back
coursed
down
her
cheeks
then
marc
began
to
speak
in
such
a
way
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
quitted
her
only
the
previous
day
such
indeed
was
his
desire
to
reassure
her
our
little
clément
well
he
asked
she
did
not
answer
immediately
for
she
feared
no
doubt
that
she
might
reveal
the
emotion
which
was
choking
her
the
little
boy
who
had
lately
completed
his
fourth
year
was
no
longer
at
dherbecourt
having
removed
him
from
his
nurse
geneviève
now
kept
him
with
her
in
spite
of
all
her
grandmother
scoldings
is
quite
well
she
said
at
last
in
a
slightly
tremulous
voice
though
on
her
side
also
she
strove
to
affect
a
kind
of
indifferent
quietude
our
louise
marc
resumed
you
satisfied
with
her
she
does
not
comply
with
my
desires
you
have
remained
the
master
of
her
mind
but
she
is
well
behaved
she
studies
and
i
do
not
complain
of
her
silence
fell
again
embarrassment
once
more
stayed
their
tongues
that
allusion
to
their
daughter
first
communion
and
the
terrible
quarrel
which
had
parted
them
had
been
sufficient
yet
the
virulence
of
that
quarrel
was
necessarily
abating
day
by
day
the
girl
herself
having
assumed
all
responsibility
by
her
quiet
resolve
to
await
her
twentieth
year
before
making
any
formal
confession
of
religious
faith
in
her
gentle
way
she
had
exhausted
her
mother
resolution
and
indeed
a
gesture
of
lassitude
had
escaped
the
latter
when
speaking
of
her
as
if
she
had
referred
to
some
happiness
all
hope
of
which
had
fled
a
few
moments
went
by
and
then
marc
gently
ventured
to
put
another
question
to
her
you
my
friend
you
have
been
so
ill
how
are
you
now
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
in
a
hopeless
way
and
was
again
obliged
to
force
back
her
tears
oh
i
have
long
ceased
to
know
how
i
am
but
no
matter
i
resign
myself
to
live
since
god
gives
me
the
strength
to
do
so
so
great
was
marc
distress
so
deeply
was
his
whole
being
stirred
by
a
quiver
of
loving
compassion
at
the
sight
of
such
great
suffering
that
a
cry
of
intense
anxiety
sprang
from
his
lips
my
geneviève
what
ails
you
what
is
your
torment
tell
me
ah
if
i
could
only
console
you
and
cure
you
thus
speaking
he
came
nearer
to
her
on
the
bench
near
enough
indeed
to
touch
the
folds
of
her
gown
but
she
hastily
drew
back
no
we
have
nothing
more
in
common
she
exclaimed
can
no
longer
do
anything
for
me
my
friend
for
we
belong
to
different
worlds
ah
if
i
were
to
tell
you
but
of
what
use
would
it
be
you
would
not
understand
me
nevertheless
she
went
on
speaking
and
in
short
and
feverish
sentences
never
noticing
that
she
was
confessing
herself
she
told
him
of
her
torture
her
daily
increasing
anguish
for
she
had
reached
one
of
those
distressful
hours
when
the
heart
instinctively
opens
and
overflows
she
related
how
unknown
to
madame
duparque
she
had
escaped
that
afternoon
from
maillebois
in
order
to
speak
with
a
famous
missionary
father
athanase
whose
pious
counsels
were
at
that
time
revolutionising
the
pious
folk
of
beaumont
the
missionary
was
merely
sojourning
there
for
a
short
time
but
it
was
said
that
he
had
already
worked
some
marvellous
cures
a
blessing
a
prayer
from
his
lips
having
restored
angelic
calmness
to
the
unappeasable
souls
of
women
who
were
racked
by
their
yearning
for
jesus
and
geneviève
had
just
left
the
neighbouring
cathedral
where
for
two
hours
she
had
remained
in
prayer
after
confessing
to
that
holy
man
her
unquenchable
thirst
for
divine
happiness
but
he
had
merely
absolved
her
for
what
he
called
excess
of
pride
and
human
passion
and
by
way
of
penitence
had
told
her
to
occupy
her
mind
with
humble
duties
such
as
the
care
of
the
poor
and
the
sick
in
vain
afterwards
had
she
striven
to
humble
annihilate
herself
in
the
darkest
the
loneliest
chapel
of
maxence
she
had
not
found
peace
she
had
not
satisfied
her
hunger
she
still
glowed
with
the
same
craving
a
return
for
the
gift
of
her
whole
being
to
the
deity
that
gift
which
she
had
tendered
again
and
again
though
never
once
had
it
brought
real
peace
and
happiness
to
her
flesh
and
her
heart
as
marc
listened
to
what
she
said
he
began
to
suspect
the
truth
and
whatever
might
be
his
sadness
at
seeing
his
geneviève
so
wretched
a
quiver
of
hope
arose
within
him
plainly
enough
neither
abbé
quandieu
nor
even
father
théodose
had
satisfied
the
intense
need
of
love
that
existed
in
her
nature
she
had
known
love
and
she
must
still
love
the
man
the
husband
whom
she
had
quitted
and
who
adored
her
mere
mystical
delights
had
left
her
unsatisfied
and
irritated
she
was
now
but
the
proud
stubborn
daughter
of
catholicism
who
turns
desperately
to
harsher
and
more
frantic
religious
practices
as
to
stronger
stupefacients
in
order
to
numb
the
bitterness
and
rebellion
induced
by
increasing
disillusion
everything
pointed
to
it
the
revival
of
motherliness
in
her
nature
for
she
had
taken
little
clément
back
and
busied
herself
with
him
and
she
even
found
some
consolation
in
louise
who
exercised
a
gentle
healing
influence
over
her
leading
her
back
a
little
more
each
day
towards
the
father
the
husband
then
also
there
were
her
dissensions
with
her
terrible
grandmother
and
her
dawning
dislike
for
the
little
house
on
the
place
des
capucins
where
she
at
last
felt
she
could
no
longer
live
for
its
coldness
silence
and
gloom
were
deathly
and
after
failing
with
abbé
quandieu
and
father
théodose
her
sufferings
had
led
her
to
make
a
supreme
attempt
with
that
powerful
missionary
to
whom
she
had
transferred
her
faith
that
confessor
whom
she
had
hastened
to
consult
in
secret
for
fear
lest
she
might
be
prevented
and
who
by
way
of
relief
had
only
been
able
to
prescribe
practices
which
in
the
circumstances
were
childish
my
geneviève
marc
cried
again
carried
away
losing
all
thought
of
prudence
you
are
thus
beset
thus
tortured
it
is
because
you
lack
our
home
you
are
too
unhappy
come
back
come
back
i
entreat
you
her
pride
bristled
up
however
and
she
answered
no
i
shall
never
go
back
to
you
i
am
not
unhappy
it
is
untrue
i
am
punished
for
having
loved
you
for
having
been
part
of
you
for
having
had
a
share
in
your
crime
grandmother
does
right
to
remind
me
of
it
when
i
am
so
weak
as
to
complain
i
expiate
your
sin
god
strikes
me
to
punish
you
and
it
is
your
poison
which
burns
me
beyond
hope
of
relief
my
poor
wife
all
that
is
monstrous
they
are
driving
you
mad
if
it
is
true
that
i
set
a
new
harvest
in
you
it
is
precisely
on
that
harvest
that
i
rely
to
ensure
our
happiness
some
day
yes
we
became
so
blended
one
with
the
other
that
we
can
never
be
wholly
parted
and
you
will
end
by
returning
to
me
our
children
will
bring
you
back
the
pretended
poison
which
your
foolish
grandmother
talks
about
is
our
love
itself
it
is
working
in
your
heart
and
it
will
bring
you
back
god
would
strike
us
down
both
of
us
she
retorted
drove
me
from
our
home
by
your
blasphemy
if
you
had
really
loved
me
you
would
not
have
taken
my
daughter
from
me
by
refusing
to
let
her
make
her
first
communion
how
can
i
return
to
a
home
of
impiety
where
it
would
not
even
be
allowable
for
me
to
pray
ah
how
wretched
i
am
nobody
nobody
loves
me
and
heaven
itself
will
not
open
she
burst
into
sobs
filled
with
despair
by
that
frightful
cry
of
distress
marc
felt
that
it
would
be
useless
and
cruel
to
torture
her
further
the
hour
for
reunion
had
not
yet
come
silence
fell
between
them
once
more
while
in
the
distance
on
the
avenue
des
jaffres
the
cries
of
some
children
at
play
rose
into
the
limpid
evening
atmosphere
during
their
impassioned
converse
they
had
at
last
drawn
nearer
to
each
other
on
the
lonely
bench
and
now
seated
side
by
side
they
seemed
to
be
reflecting
their
glances
wandering
away
amid
the
golden
dust
of
the
sunset
at
last
marc
spoke
again
as
if
finishing
his
thoughts
aloud
do
not
think
my
friend
that
you
gave
for
a
moment
any
credit
to
the
abominable
charges
with
which
certain
people
wished
to
besmirch
me
of
my
brotherly
intercourse
with
mademoiselle
mazeline
no
geneviève
answered
quickly
know
you
and
i
know
her
do
not
imagine
that
i
have
become
so
foolish
as
to
believe
all
that
has
been
said
to
me
then
with
some
slight
embarrassment
she
continued
is
the
same
with
me
some
people
i
know
it
have
set
me
among
the
flock
which
father
théodose
is
said
to
have
turned
into
a
kind
of
in
the
first
place
i
do
not
admit
that
anything
of
the
kind
exists
father
théodose
is
perhaps
rather
too
proud
of
his
person
but
i
believe
his
faith
to
be
sincere
besides
i
should
have
known
how
to
defend
myself
you
do
not
doubt
it
i
hope
in
spite
of
his
sorrow
marc
could
not
help
smiling
slightly
geneviève
evident
embarrassment
indicated
that
there
had
been
some
audacity
on
the
part
of
the
capuchin
and
that
she
had
checked
it
assuming
this
to
be
the
case
marc
felt
the
better
able
to
understand
why
she
was
so
perturbed
and
embittered
certainly
do
not
doubt
it
he
responded
know
you
as
you
know
me
and
i
am
aware
that
you
are
incapable
of
i
have
no
anxiety
respecting
father
théodose
on
your
account
whatever
another
husband
of
my
acquaintance
may
have
to
say
yet
all
the
same
i
regret
that
you
were
so
badly
advised
as
to
quit
worthy
abbé
quandieu
for
that
handsome
monk
a
fugitive
blush
which
appeared
on
geneviève
cheeks
while
her
husband
was
speaking
told
him
that
he
had
guessed
aright
it
was
not
without
a
profound
knowledge
of
woman
in
her
earlier
years
when
an
may
exist
within
the
penitent
that
father
crabot
had
advised
madame
duparque
to
remove
her
daughter
from
the
charge
of
old
abbé
quandieu
and
place
her
in
that
of
handsome
father
théodose
the
catholic
doctors
are
well
aware
that
love
alone
can
kill
love
and
that
a
woman
who
loves
apart
from
christ
never
wholly
belongs
to
christ
the
return
of
geneviève
to
her
husband
and
her
sin
was
fatal
unless
she
should
cease
to
love
or
rather
unless
she
should
love
elsewhere
but
as
it
happened
father
théodose
was
not
expert
in
analysing
human
nature
he
had
blundered
with
respect
to
the
passionate
yet
loyal
penitent
confided
to
his
hands
and
had
thus
precipitated
the
crisis
provoking
repugnance
and
rebellion
in
that
distracted
suffering
woman
who
without
as
yet
returning
to
sober
reason
saw
the
glorious
mystical
of
the
religion
of
her
childhood
collapse
around
her
well
pleased
with
the
symptoms
which
he
fancied
he
could
detect
marc
asked
somewhat
maliciously
so
father
théodose
is
no
longer
your
confessor
geneviève
turned
her
clear
eyes
upon
him
and
answered
plainly
father
théodose
does
not
suit
me
and
i
have
gone
back
to
abbé
quandieu
who
as
grandmother
rightly
says
lacks
warmth
but
who
quiets
me
at
times
for
he
is
very
kind
for
a
moment
she
seemed
to
ponder
then
in
an
undertone
she
allowed
another
avowal
to
cross
her
lips
the
same
the
dear
man
does
not
know
how
greatly
he
has
increased
the
torment
in
which
i
live
by
what
he
said
to
me
about
that
abominable
affair
she
stopped
short
and
marc
guessing
the
truth
becoming
quite
impassioned
now
that
this
subject
was
broached
continued
simon
affair
eh
abbé
quandieu
believes
simon
to
be
innocent
does
he
not
geneviève
had
cast
her
eyes
towards
the
ground
for
a
moment
she
remained
silent
then
said
very
faintly
he
believes
in
his
innocence
he
told
me
so
with
great
mystery
in
the
choir
of
his
church
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
before
our
lord
who
heard
him
you
yourself
geneviève
tell
me
do
you
now
believe
in
innocence
i
do
not
i
can
not
you
must
remember
that
i
should
never
have
left
you
had
i
believed
him
innocent
for
his
innocence
would
have
meant
the
guilt
of
the
defenders
of
god
you
by
defending
him
charged
god
with
error
and
falsehood
marc
well
remembered
the
circumstances
he
again
saw
his
wife
bring
him
the
news
of
the
revision
growing
exasperated
at
the
sight
of
his
delight
exclaiming
that
there
was
no
truth
or
justice
outside
heaven
and
at
last
fleeing
from
the
house
where
her
faith
was
outraged
and
now
that
she
seemed
to
him
to
be
shaken
he
desired
more
ardently
than
ever
to
convince
her
of
the
truth
for
he
felt
that
he
would
win
her
back
as
soon
as
with
the
triumph
of
truth
her
mind
should
awaken
to
the
necessity
of
justice
once
more
geneviève
my
geneviève
it
is
impossible
that
you
who
are
so
upright
and
so
sincere
whose
mind
is
so
clear
when
the
superstitions
of
your
childhood
do
not
cloud
it
it
is
impossible
that
you
should
believe
such
gross
falsehoods
inform
yourself
read
the
documents
i
am
fully
informed
i
assure
you
my
friend
i
have
read
everything
have
read
all
the
documents
which
have
been
published
all
the
inquiry
of
the
court
of
cassation
yes
i
have
read
everything
that
has
appeared
in
petit
you
know
very
well
that
grandmother
takes
that
paper
every
morning
with
a
violent
gesture
marc
gave
expression
to
his
disgust
and
indignation
well
my
darling
you
are
indeed
fully
informed
the
vile
print
you
speak
of
is
a
sewer
of
poison
which
disseminates
only
filth
and
falsehood
documents
are
falsified
in
it
texts
are
mutilated
and
the
poor
credulous
minds
of
the
poor
and
the
lowly
are
gorged
with
stupid
you
are
simply
poisoned
like
many
other
worthy
folk
footnote
this
is
exactly
what
happened
in
the
dreyfus
case
if
apart
from
all
those
who
hating
dreyfus
as
a
jew
were
resolved
to
regard
him
as
guilty
whatever
might
be
the
evidence
there
are
still
millions
of
frenchmen
who
honestly
retain
a
belief
in
his
culpability
this
is
because
scores
of
french
newspapers
those
owned
or
patronised
by
the
nationalist
party
and
the
roman
catholic
church
deliberately
falsified
and
mutilated
documents
and
evidence
serving
to
their
readers
only
such
particulars
as
tended
to
indicate
the
prisoner
guilt
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
half
of
france
is
still
ignorant
of
the
real
facts
of
the
dreyfus
case
we
are
often
told
that
the
press
has
much
power
for
good
never
was
its
power
for
evil
more
strikingly
exemplified
than
in
that
lamentable
affair
from
the
effects
of
which
france
is
still
she
herself
no
doubt
was
conscious
that
the
folly
and
impudence
of
petit
were
excessive
for
again
she
cast
down
her
eyes
and
looked
distressed
marc
resumed
me
send
you
the
complete
verbatim
report
of
the
court
inquiry
with
the
documents
annexed
to
it
and
promise
me
that
you
will
read
everything
attentively
and
straightforwardly
but
at
this
suggestion
she
vivaciously
raised
her
head
no
send
me
nothing
i
do
not
wish
it
it
is
useless
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
read
anything
he
looked
at
her
again
feeling
discouraged
and
grieved
rather
that
you
wo
read
yes
if
you
prefer
it
that
way
i
wo
read
anything
as
grandmother
says
what
is
the
use
of
it
ought
one
not
always
to
distrust
one
reason
wo
read
anything
because
you
fear
you
might
be
convinced
because
you
already
doubt
the
things
which
only
yesterday
you
regarded
as
certainties
she
interrupted
him
with
a
gesture
of
fatigue
and
unconcern
but
he
continued
the
words
of
abbé
quandieu
pursue
you
you
ask
yourself
with
terror
how
a
holy
priest
can
believe
in
an
innocence
which
if
recognised
would
compel
you
to
curse
all
the
years
of
error
with
which
you
have
tortured
our
poor
home
this
time
she
did
not
even
make
a
gesture
but
it
was
apparent
that
she
had
resolved
to
listen
no
further
for
a
moment
her
glance
remained
fixed
on
the
ground
then
she
slowly
said
not
amuse
yourself
by
increasing
my
sorrow
our
life
has
been
shattered
it
is
all
over
i
should
deem
myself
still
more
guilty
than
now
if
i
were
to
go
back
to
you
and
what
personal
relief
could
it
give
you
to
imagine
that
i
made
a
mistake
and
that
i
have
not
found
my
grandmother
house
to
be
the
home
of
peace
and
faith
in
which
i
thought
i
was
taking
refuge
my
sufferings
would
not
cure
yours
this
as
marc
felt
was
almost
a
confession
an
acknowledgment
of
her
secret
regret
at
having
quitted
him
and
of
the
anxious
doubts
into
which
she
had
sunk
once
more
therefore
he
exclaimed
if
you
are
unhappy
say
it
and
come
back
bring
the
children
with
you
the
house
still
awaits
you
it
would
be
great
joy
great
happiness
but
she
stood
up
and
repeated
like
one
who
obstinately
remains
blind
and
deaf
am
not
unhappy
i
am
being
punished
and
i
will
endure
my
punishment
to
the
end
and
if
you
have
any
pity
for
me
remain
here
do
not
try
to
follow
me
should
you
meet
me
again
too
turn
your
head
away
for
all
is
ended
all
must
be
ended
between
us
then
she
went
off
along
the
deserted
avenue
amid
the
paling
gold
of
the
sunset
her
figure
quite
sombre
tall
and
slim
and
all
that
marc
could
still
see
of
her
beauty
was
her
splendid
fair
hair
which
a
last
sunbeam
irradiated
he
obediently
refrained
from
moving
but
hoping
for
a
last
glance
of
farewell
he
watched
her
as
she
walked
away
she
did
not
turn
however
she
disappeared
from
view
among
the
trees
while
the
evening
wind
now
rising
passed
with
a
chilling
quiver
beneath
the
foliage
when
marc
painfully
rose
to
his
feet
he
was
amazed
to
see
his
good
friend
salvan
standing
before
him
with
a
happy
smile
on
his
lips
my
fine
lover
so
this
is
how
i
catch
you
giving
assignations
in
lonely
corners
i
saw
you
already
some
time
ago
but
remained
watching
for
i
did
not
wish
to
disturb
you
so
this
is
why
you
remained
with
me
such
a
short
time
when
you
called
at
the
college
this
afternoon
master
slyboots
sadly
shaking
his
head
marc
walked
away
beside
his
old
friend
no
he
said
merely
met
by
chance
and
my
heart
is
quite
lacerated
then
he
recounted
the
meeting
and
the
long
conversation
from
which
he
had
just
emerged
feeling
more
convinced
than
ever
that
the
rupture
was
definitive
salvan
who
had
never
consoled
himself
for
having
promoted
a
marriage
which
however
happy
at
the
outset
was
ending
so
badly
and
who
recognised
that
he
had
acted
with
great
imprudence
in
wedding
free
thought
to
the
church
listened
attentively
ceasing
to
smile
yet
looking
fairly
satisfied
that
is
not
so
bad
he
said
at
last
surely
did
not
expect
that
our
poor
geneviève
would
throw
herself
at
your
head
and
entreat
you
to
take
her
back
when
a
woman
leaves
her
husband
to
give
herself
to
god
as
your
wife
did
her
pride
prevents
her
from
acknowledging
in
that
way
the
distress
she
now
feels
at
having
failed
to
find
the
contentment
she
anticipated
none
the
less
in
my
opinion
geneviève
is
passing
through
a
frightful
crisis
which
may
bring
her
back
to
you
at
any
moment
if
truth
should
enlighten
her
she
will
act
at
once
she
has
retained
too
much
sense
to
be
unjust
and
again
becoming
gay
and
animated
salvan
went
on
never
told
you
my
friend
of
the
attempts
i
made
with
madame
duparque
of
recent
years
as
they
resulted
in
nothing
there
was
no
occasion
for
me
to
vaunt
them
to
you
however
when
your
wife
acted
so
inconsiderately
when
she
left
you
i
thought
of
giving
her
a
little
lecture
for
i
was
an
old
friend
of
her
father
and
besides
i
had
been
her
own
guardian
that
circumstance
naturally
gave
me
admittance
to
the
dismal
little
house
on
the
place
des
capucins
but
you
can
have
no
idea
of
the
ferocious
manner
in
which
the
terrible
old
grandmother
received
me
she
would
not
leave
me
alone
with
geneviève
for
a
moment
and
she
interrupted
every
conciliatory
phrase
of
mine
with
imprecations
intended
to
fall
on
you
nevertheless
i
think
i
managed
to
say
what
i
wished
to
say
true
the
poor
child
was
in
no
fit
state
to
listen
to
me
when
catholic
training
revives
the
ravages
which
religious
exaltation
may
cause
in
a
brain
are
frightful
geneviève
for
her
part
appeared
and
healthy
when
you
married
her
but
that
unfortunate
simon
affair
sufficed
to
shatter
all
equilibrium
she
would
not
even
listen
to
me
her
answers
were
so
wild
and
foolish
as
to
make
one
reason
stagger
briefly
i
was
beaten
i
was
not
exactly
turned
out
of
doors
but
after
two
subsequent
attempts
made
at
long
intervals
i
lost
all
hope
of
introducing
a
little
reasonableness
into
that
abode
of
insanity
where
poor
madame
berthereau
in
spite
of
her
sufferings
seemed
the
only
person
who
retained
a
little
good
sense
see
very
well
that
there
is
no
hope
responded
marc
who
remained
very
gloomy
can
not
reclaim
people
when
they
so
stubbornly
persist
in
refusing
to
make
themselves
acquainted
with
the
truth
not
asked
salvan
done
for
that
true
it
would
be
useless
for
me
to
make
any
fresh
attempt
they
would
stop
up
their
eyes
and
ears
beforehand
in
order
to
see
and
hear
nothing
but
remember
that
you
have
the
most
powerful
of
helpers
the
best
of
advocates
the
shrewdest
of
diplomatists
the
most
skilful
of
captains
and
in
fact
the
most
triumphant
of
conquerors
at
work
in
that
house
he
laughed
and
growing
quite
excited
resumed
yes
your
charming
louise
whom
i
very
fond
of
and
whom
i
regard
as
a
prodigy
of
good
sense
and
grace
the
firm
and
yet
gentle
behaviour
of
that
young
girl
ever
since
her
twelfth
year
has
been
that
of
a
heroine
i
know
of
no
loftier
or
more
touching
example
seldom
does
one
meet
with
such
precocious
sense
and
courage
and
she
is
all
deference
and
affection
even
when
she
refuses
to
do
what
her
mother
desires
by
reason
of
her
promise
to
you
respecting
her
first
communion
now
that
she
has
acquired
the
right
to
keep
that
promise
you
should
see
how
prettily
how
sedately
she
manœuvres
to
effect
the
conquest
of
that
house
where
everybody
is
against
her
even
her
grandmother
becomes
tired
of
scolding
but
her
dexterity
is
most
marvellous
with
her
mother
whom
she
encompasses
with
an
active
worship
with
all
sorts
of
attentions
as
if
dealing
with
some
convalescent
patient
whose
physical
and
moral
strength
must
first
of
all
be
restored
in
order
that
she
may
afterwards
return
to
ordinary
life
she
seldom
speaks
to
her
mother
of
you
but
she
accustoms
her
to
live
in
an
atmosphere
which
is
full
of
you
full
of
your
thoughts
and
your
love
she
is
there
like
your
other
self
never
pausing
in
her
endeavours
to
bring
about
the
return
of
the
wife
and
mother
by
reconnecting
the
severed
bond
with
her
own
caressing
hands
and
if
your
wife
returns
to
you
my
friend
it
will
be
the
child
who
will
bring
her
back
the
child
whose
presence
ensures
health
and
peace
in
one
home
marc
listened
feeling
deeply
moved
and
reviving
to
hope
may
it
be
true
said
he
my
poor
geneviève
is
still
very
your
little
healer
do
her
work
salvan
responded
kiss
she
gives
her
mother
every
morning
brings
life
with
it
if
geneviève
suffers
such
torture
it
is
because
life
is
struggling
within
her
and
wresting
her
a
little
more
each
day
from
the
deadly
crisis
in
which
you
nearly
lost
her
as
soon
as
good
mother
nature
triumphs
over
mystical
imbecility
she
and
your
children
will
be
in
your
arms
come
my
friend
be
brave
it
would
be
hard
indeed
if
after
restoring
poor
simon
to
his
family
your
own
domestic
happiness
should
not
be
assured
by
the
triumph
of
truth
and
justice
they
shook
hands
in
brotherly
fashion
and
marc
who
returned
to
maillebois
somewhat
comforted
found
himself
on
the
morrow
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
again
the
flight
of
brother
gorgias
had
had
a
disastrous
effect
in
the
little
town
and
the
great
days
of
the
affair
were
now
beginning
afresh
there
was
not
a
house
whose
inmates
did
not
quarrel
and
fight
over
the
possible
guilt
of
that
terrible
christian
brother
who
in
disappearing
from
the
scene
had
impudently
written
to
petit
to
explain
that
as
his
cowardly
superiors
had
decided
to
abandon
him
to
his
enemies
he
was
about
to
place
himself
in
safety
in
order
that
he
might
be
free
to
defend
himself
when
and
how
he
pleased
a
much
more
important
feature
of
this
letter
was
however
a
revised
statement
which
gorgias
made
in
it
to
account
for
the
presence
of
the
famous
in
the
paper
gag
found
near
zéphirin
body
no
doubt
the
complicated
story
of
a
forgery
invented
by
his
leaders
who
were
unwilling
even
to
admit
that
the
had
come
from
the
school
had
always
been
regarded
by
gorgias
as
idiotic
he
must
have
thought
it
stupid
to
deny
the
origin
of
the
slip
and
the
authenticity
of
the
initialling
although
every
expert
in
the
world
might
ascribe
that
initialling
to
simon
it
would
remain
his
gorgias
handiwork
in
the
estimation
of
all
honest
and
sensible
folk
however
as
his
superiors
had
threatened
to
abandon
him
to
his
own
resources
if
he
did
not
accept
their
version
of
the
affair
he
had
resigned
himself
and
relinquished
his
own
it
was
to
the
latter
that
he
now
reverted
for
since
the
missing
corner
bearing
the
school
stamp
had
been
found
at
father
philibin
he
regarded
his
superiors
version
as
utterly
ridiculous
it
seemed
to
him
absurd
to
pretend
as
the
congregations
did
that
simon
had
procured
a
stamp
or
had
caused
one
to
be
made
with
the
deliberate
intention
of
ruining
the
brothers
school
now
therefore
realising
that
his
supporters
were
on
the
point
of
forsaking
and
sacrificing
him
gorgias
left
them
of
his
own
accord
and
by
way
of
intimidation
revealed
a
part
of
the
truth
his
new
version
which
upset
all
the
credulous
readers
of
petit
was
that
the
had
really
come
from
the
brothers
and
had
been
initialled
by
himself
but
that
zéphirin
had
assuredly
taken
it
home
with
him
from
the
school
even
as
victor
milhomme
had
taken
a
similar
slip
in
spite
of
all
prohibitions
and
that
simon
had
thus
found
it
on
the
table
in
his
victim
room
on
the
night
of
the
abominable
crime
a
fortnight
after
the
appearance
of
this
version
the
newspaper
published
a
fresh
letter
from
brother
gorgias
he
had
taken
refuge
in
italy
he
said
but
he
abstained
from
supplying
his
exact
address
though
he
offered
to
return
and
give
evidence
at
the
approaching
trial
at
rozan
if
he
received
a
formal
guarantee
that
his
liberty
would
not
be
interfered
with
in
this
second
letter
he
still
called
simon
a
loathsome
jew
and
declared
that
he
possessed
overwhelming
proof
of
his
guilt
which
proof
however
he
would
only
divulge
to
the
jury
at
the
assize
court
at
the
same
time
this
did
not
prevent
him
from
referring
to
his
superiors
notably
father
crabot
in
aggressive
and
outrageous
terms
fraught
with
all
the
bitter
violence
of
an
accomplice
once
willingly
accepted
but
now
cast
off
and
sacrificed
how
idiotic
said
he
was
their
story
of
a
forged
school
stamp
what
a
wretched
falsehood
when
the
truth
might
well
be
told
they
were
fools
and
cowards
cowards
especially
for
had
they
not
acted
with
the
vilest
cowardice
in
abandoning
him
gorgias
the
faithful
servant
of
god
after
sacrificing
both
the
heroic
father
philibin
and
the
unhappy
brother
fulgence
of
the
latter
he
only
spoke
in
terms
of
indulgent
contempt
fulgence
said
he
had
been
a
sorry
individual
unhinged
and
full
of
vanity
and
the
others
after
allowing
him
all
freedom
to
compromise
himself
had
got
rid
of
him
by
sending
him
to
some
distant
spot
under
the
pretext
that
he
was
as
for
father
philibin
gorgias
set
him
on
a
pinnacle
called
him
his
friend
a
hero
of
dutifulness
one
who
displayed
passive
obedience
to
his
chiefs
who
on
their
side
employed
him
for
the
dirtiest
work
and
struck
him
down
as
soon
as
it
was
to
their
interest
to
close
his
mouth
and
this
hero
who
was
now
suffering
untold
agony
in
a
convent
among
the
apennines
was
depicted
by
gorgias
as
a
martyr
of
the
faith
even
as
he
had
been
depicted
in
print
with
a
palm
and
a
halo
by
some
of
the
ardent
from
this
point
gorgias
proceeded
to
glorify
himself
with
extraordinary
vehemence
wild
and
splendid
impudence
he
became
superb
he
displayed
such
a
mixture
of
frankness
and
falsehood
energy
and
duplicity
that
if
the
fates
had
been
propitious
this
base
rascal
might
assuredly
have
become
a
great
man
even
as
his
superiors
were
still
pleased
to
admit
he
remained
a
model
cleric
full
of
admirable
exclusive
militant
faith
one
who
assigned
to
the
church
the
royalty
both
of
heaven
and
of
earth
and
who
regarded
himself
as
the
church
soldier
privileged
to
do
everything
in
her
defence
at
the
head
of
the
church
was
the
deity
then
came
his
superiors
and
himself
and
when
he
had
given
an
account
of
his
actions
to
his
superiors
and
the
deity
the
only
thing
left
for
the
rest
of
the
world
was
submission
moreover
his
superiors
were
of
no
account
when
he
deemed
them
to
be
unworthy
in
that
case
he
remained
alone
in
the
presence
of
heaven
thus
on
days
of
confession
when
god
had
absolved
him
he
regarded
himself
as
the
unique
the
one
pure
man
who
owed
no
account
of
his
actions
to
anybody
and
who
was
above
all
human
laws
was
not
this
indeed
the
essential
catholic
doctrine
according
to
which
the
ministers
of
the
faith
are
rightly
amenable
to
the
divine
authority
alone
and
was
it
not
only
a
father
crabot
full
of
social
cowardice
who
could
trouble
himself
about
imbecile
human
justice
and
the
stupid
opinions
of
the
multitude
in
this
second
letter
moreover
brother
gorgias
admitted
with
a
serene
lack
of
shame
that
he
himself
occasionally
sinned
he
then
beat
his
breast
cried
aloud
that
he
was
but
a
wolf
and
a
hog
and
humbly
cast
himself
in
the
dust
at
the
feet
of
god
having
thus
made
atonement
he
became
tranquil
and
continued
to
serve
the
church
in
all
holiness
until
the
clay
of
creation
cast
him
into
sin
again
whereupon
fresh
absolution
became
necessary
but
in
any
case
he
was
at
least
a
loyal
catholic
he
had
the
courage
to
confess
and
the
strength
to
endure
penitence
whereas
all
those
dignitaries
of
the
church
those
superiors
of
the
religious
orders
of
whom
he
complained
so
bitterly
were
liars
and
poltroons
who
trembled
before
the
consequences
of
their
transgressions
who
like
base
hypocrites
concealed
them
or
else
cast
them
upon
others
in
their
terror
of
the
judgment
of
men
at
the
outset
brother
gorgias
passionate
recriminations
had
seemed
to
be
prompted
merely
by
his
anger
at
being
so
brutally
abandoned
after
serving
as
a
docile
instrument
but
at
present
veiled
threats
began
to
mingle
with
his
reproaches
if
he
himself
had
always
paid
for
his
transgressions
like
a
good
christian
there
were
others
he
said
who
had
not
done
so
yet
some
day
assuredly
they
would
be
forced
to
make
atonement
should
they
continue
to
try
the
patience
of
heaven
which
would
well
know
how
to
set
up
an
avenger
a
justiciary
to
proclaim
the
unconfessed
unpunished
crimes
in
saying
this
gorgias
was
evidently
alluding
to
father
crabot
and
the
mysterious
story
of
the
acquisition
of
the
countess
de
quédeville
immense
fortune
that
splendid
domain
of
valmarie
where
the
jesuit
college
had
been
subsequently
established
several
confused
versions
of
that
story
had
been
current
and
certain
particulars
were
now
recalled
the
old
but
still
beautiful
countess
becoming
extremely
pious
and
engaging
father
philibin
then
a
young
man
as
tutor
to
her
grandson
gaston
the
last
of
the
quédevilles
who
was
barely
nine
years
old
next
father
crabot
arriving
at
the
château
and
becoming
the
confessor
the
friend
and
some
even
said
the
lover
of
the
still
beautiful
countess
finally
the
accident
the
death
of
little
gaston
who
had
been
drowned
while
walking
out
with
his
tutor
his
death
allowing
his
grandmother
to
bequeath
the
family
estate
and
fortune
to
father
crabot
through
the
medium
of
a
clerical
banker
of
beaumont
and
it
was
also
remembered
that
among
little
gaston
playmates
there
had
been
a
gamekeeper
son
a
lad
named
georges
plumet
whom
the
jesuits
of
valmarie
subsequently
protected
and
assisted
and
who
was
none
other
than
the
present
brother
gorgias
the
latter
violent
language
and
threatening
manner
recalled
all
those
incidents
and
revived
the
old
suspicion
that
some
dark
deed
might
link
the
gamekeeper
humble
son
to
the
powerful
clerics
who
ruled
the
region
would
that
not
explain
the
protection
which
they
had
so
long
given
him
the
audacious
manner
in
which
they
had
shielded
him
and
at
last
even
made
his
cause
their
own
doubtless
their
first
impulse
had
been
to
save
the
church
but
a
little
later
they
had
done
their
utmost
to
make
that
terrible
ignorantine
appear
innocent
and
if
they
had
now
sacrificed
him
it
must
be
because
they
deemed
it
impossible
to
defend
him
any
longer
perhaps
too
brother
gorgias
only
wished
to
alarm
them
in
order
to
wring
from
them
as
much
money
as
possible
that
he
did
alarm
them
was
certain
one
could
detect
that
they
were
greatly
disturbed
by
the
letters
and
articles
of
that
dreadful
chatterer
who
was
ever
ready
to
beat
his
breast
and
cry
his
sinfulness
and
that
of
others
aloud
moreover
in
spite
of
the
seeming
abandonment
in
which
he
was
left
one
could
divine
that
he
was
still
protected
powerfully
even
if
secretly
while
his
sudden
intervals
of
silence
which
lasted
at
times
for
weeks
plainly
indicated
that
friendly
messages
and
money
had
been
sent
to
him
his
admissions
and
his
threats
quite
upset
the
rank
and
file
of
the
clerical
faction
it
was
horrible
he
profaned
the
temple
he
exposed
the
secrets
of
the
tabernacle
to
the
unhealthy
curiosity
of
unbelievers
nevertheless
a
good
many
devout
folk
remained
attached
to
him
impressed
by
the
uncompromising
faith
with
which
he
bowed
to
god
alone
and
refused
to
recognise
any
of
the
rights
of
human
society
besides
why
should
one
not
accept
his
version
of
the
affair
his
admission
that
he
had
really
initialled
the
that
it
had
been
carried
away
by
zéphirin
and
utilised
by
simon
for
a
diabolical
purpose
this
version
was
less
ridiculous
than
that
of
his
superiors
it
even
supplied
an
excuse
for
what
father
philibin
had
done
for
one
could
picture
the
latter
losing
his
head
and
tearing
off
the
stamped
corner
of
the
slip
in
a
moment
of
blind
zeal
for
the
safety
of
his
holy
mother
the
church
to
tell
the
truth
however
a
far
greater
number
of
laymen
those
who
were
faithful
to
father
crabot
as
well
as
nearly
all
the
priests
and
other
clerics
clung
stubbornly
to
the
jesuits
revised
version
of
the
incident
that
of
simon
forging
the
paraph
and
using
a
false
stamp
it
was
an
absurd
idea
but
the
readers
of
petit
became
all
the
more
impassioned
over
it
for
the
invention
of
a
false
stamp
added
yet
another
glaring
improbability
to
the
affair
every
morning
the
newspaper
repeated
imperturbably
that
material
proofs
existed
of
the
making
of
that
false
stamp
and
that
the
recondemnation
of
simon
by
the
rozan
assize
court
could
no
longer
be
a
matter
of
doubt
for
anybody
the
rallying
word
had
been
passed
round
and
all
people
made
a
show
of
believing
that
the
brothers
school
would
triumph
as
soon
as
the
impious
adversaries
of
the
unfortunate
brother
gorgias
should
be
confounded
the
school
greatly
needed
such
a
victory
for
discredited
as
it
was
by
the
and
unpleasant
discoveries
of
recent
times
it
had
just
lost
two
more
of
its
pupils
only
the
final
overthrow
of
simon
and
his
return
to
the
galleys
could
restore
its
lustre
until
then
it
was
fit
that
brother
successor
should
remain
patiently
in
the
background
while
father
théodose
the
superior
of
the
capuchins
who
also
triumphed
even
when
others
were
being
ruined
skilfully
exploited
the
situation
by
urging
his
devotees
to
make
little
periodical
offerings
such
for
instance
as
two
francs
a
month
to
antony
of
padua
in
order
that
the
saint
might
exert
his
influence
to
keep
the
good
brothers
school
at
maillebois
however
the
most
serious
incident
of
the
turmoil
in
the
town
was
supplied
by
abbé
quandieu
who
had
long
been
regarded
as
a
prudent
simonist
at
that
time
it
had
been
said
that
monseigneur
bergerot
the
bishop
was
behind
him
even
as
father
crabot
was
behind
the
capuchins
and
the
brothers
of
the
christian
doctrine
as
usual
indeed
the
seculars
and
the
regulars
confronted
each
other
the
priests
resenting
the
efforts
which
were
made
by
the
monks
to
divert
all
worship
and
revenue
to
their
own
profit
and
in
this
instance
as
in
fact
in
all
others
the
better
cause
was
that
of
the
priests
whose
conception
of
the
religion
of
christ
was
more
equitable
and
human
than
that
of
the
monks
nevertheless
monseigneur
bergerot
had
been
defeated
and
by
his
advice
abbé
quandieu
had
submitted
and
had
done
penance
by
attending
an
idolatrous
ceremony
at
the
capuchin
chapel
but
all
the
disastrous
disclosures
and
occurrences
of
recent
times
first
father
philibin
shown
guilty
of
perjury
and
forgery
then
brother
fulgence
spirited
away
after
compromising
himself
then
too
brother
gorgias
absconding
and
almost
confessing
his
guilt
had
stirred
the
parish
priest
of
maillebois
to
rebellion
and
revived
his
former
belief
in
simon
innocence
nevertheless
he
would
probably
have
remained
silent
in
a
spirit
of
discipline
if
abbé
cognasse
the
priest
of
jonville
had
not
gone
out
of
his
way
to
allude
to
him
in
a
sermon
saying
that
an
apostate
priest
a
hireling
of
the
jews
a
traitor
to
his
god
and
his
country
was
unhappily
at
the
head
of
a
neighbouring
parish
on
hearing
this
abbé
quandieu
christian
ardour
asserted
itself
he
could
no
longer
control
the
grief
he
felt
at
seeing
dealers
of
the
temple
as
he
called
them
betraying
the
saviour
who
was
all
truth
and
justice
thus
in
his
sermon
on
the
following
sunday
he
spoke
of
certain
baleful
men
who
were
slaying
the
church
by
their
abominable
complicity
with
the
perpetrators
of
the
vilest
crimes
one
may
picture
the
scandal
the
agitation
that
ensued
in
the
clerical
world
particularly
as
it
was
asserted
that
monseigneur
bergerot
was
again
behind
abbé
quandieu
and
was
determined
this
time
that
fanatical
and
malignant
sectarians
should
not
be
allowed
to
compromise
religion
any
further
at
last
while
passion
was
thus
running
riot
the
new
trial
began
before
the
rozan
assize
court
it
had
been
possible
to
bring
simon
back
to
france
though
he
was
still
ailing
imperfectly
cured
as
yet
of
the
exhausting
fevers
which
had
delayed
his
return
for
nearly
a
year
during
the
voyage
it
had
been
feared
that
he
would
not
be
put
ashore
alive
moreover
for
fear
of
disorder
violence
and
outrage
it
had
been
necessary
to
practise
dissimulation
with
respect
to
the
spot
where
he
would
land
and
bring
him
to
rozan
at
night
time
by
roundabout
ways
which
none
suspected
at
present
he
was
in
prison
near
the
palace
of
justice
having
only
a
street
to
cross
in
order
to
appear
before
his
judges
and
pending
that
event
he
was
closely
watched
and
guarded
defended
also
like
the
important
and
disquieting
personage
he
had
become
one
with
whose
fate
that
of
the
whole
nation
was
bound
up
the
first
person
privileged
to
see
him
was
rachel
his
wife
whom
that
reunion
after
so
many
frightful
years
cast
into
wild
emotion
ah
what
an
embrace
they
exchanged
and
how
great
was
the
grief
she
displayed
after
that
visit
so
thin
so
weak
had
she
found
him
so
aged
too
with
his
white
hair
and
he
had
showed
himself
so
strange
ignorant
as
he
still
was
of
the
facts
for
the
brief
communication
by
which
the
court
of
cassation
had
informed
him
of
the
approaching
revision
of
his
case
had
given
no
particulars
it
had
not
surprised
him
to
hear
of
the
revision
he
had
always
felt
that
it
would
some
day
take
place
and
this
conviction
in
spite
of
all
his
tortures
had
lent
him
the
strength
to
live
in
order
that
he
might
once
more
see
his
children
and
give
them
back
a
spotless
name
but
how
dark
was
the
anguish
in
which
he
had
remained
plunged
his
mind
ever
dwelling
on
the
frightful
enigma
of
his
condemnation
which
he
could
not
unravel
his
brother
david
and
advocate
delbos
who
hastened
to
the
prison
ended
by
acquainting
him
with
the
whole
monstrous
affair
the
terrible
war
which
had
been
waged
for
years
respecting
his
case
between
those
perpetual
foes
the
men
of
authoritarian
views
who
defended
the
rotten
edifice
of
the
past
and
the
men
of
free
thought
who
went
towards
the
future
then
only
did
simon
understand
the
truth
and
come
to
regard
his
personal
sufferings
as
mere
incidents
whose
only
importance
arose
from
the
fact
that
they
had
led
to
a
splendid
uprising
in
the
name
of
justice
which
would
benefit
all
mankind
moreover
he
did
not
willingly
speak
of
his
torments
he
had
suffered
less
from
his
companions
the
thieves
and
murderers
around
him
than
from
his
keepers
those
ferocious
brutes
who
were
left
free
to
act
as
they
pleased
and
who
like
disciples
of
the
marquis
de
sade
took
a
voluptuous
delight
in
torturing
and
killing
with
impunity
had
it
not
been
for
the
strength
of
resistance
which
simon
owed
to
racial
heredity
and
his
cold
logical
temperament
he
would
twenty
times
have
provoked
his
custodians
to
shoot
him
dead
and
at
present
he
talked
of
all
those
things
in
a
quiet
way
and
evinced
a
naïve
astonishment
on
being
told
of
the
extraordinary
complications
of
the
drama
of
which
he
was
the
victim
having
secured
a
citation
as
a
witness
marc
obtained
leave
of
absence
and
a
few
days
before
the
trial
began
he
took
up
his
abode
at
rozan
where
he
found
david
and
delbos
already
in
the
thick
of
the
supreme
battle
he
was
surprised
by
the
nervousness
and
anxious
thoughtfulness
of
david
who
was
usually
so
brave
and
calm
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
delbos
as
a
rule
so
gaily
valiant
was
likewise
uneasy
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
for
the
latter
a
very
big
affair
in
which
he
risked
both
his
position
as
an
advocate
and
his
increasing
popularity
as
a
socialist
leader
if
he
should
win
the
case
he
would
doubtless
end
by
beating
lemarrois
at
beaumont
but
unfortunately
all
sorts
of
disquieting
symptoms
were
becoming
manifest
indeed
marc
himself
after
reaching
rozan
full
of
hope
soon
began
to
feel
alarmed
amid
his
new
surroundings
elsewhere
even
at
maillebois
the
acquittal
of
simon
appeared
certain
to
everybody
possessed
of
any
sense
father
crabot
clients
in
their
private
converse
did
not
conceal
the
fact
that
they
felt
their
cause
to
be
greatly
endangered
the
best
news
also
came
from
paris
where
the
ministers
regarded
a
just
as
certain
lulled
into
confidence
as
they
were
by
their
agents
reports
respecting
the
court
and
the
jury
but
the
atmosphere
was
very
different
at
rozan
where
an
odour
of
falsehood
and
treachery
pervaded
the
streets
and
found
its
way
into
the
depths
of
men
souls
this
town
once
the
capital
of
a
province
and
now
greatly
fallen
from
its
former
importance
had
retained
all
its
monarchical
and
religious
faith
all
the
antiquated
fanaticism
of
a
past
age
which
elsewhere
had
disappeared
thus
it
supplied
an
excellent
for
the
congregations
which
absolutely
needed
a
decisive
victory
if
they
were
to
retain
their
teaching
privileges
and
control
the
future
and
never
had
marc
more
fully
realised
how
deeply
rome
was
interested
in
winning
that
battle
never
had
he
more
plainly
detected
that
behind
the
slightest
incidents
of
that
interminable
and
monstrous
affair
there
was
papal
rome
clinging
stubbornly
to
its
dream
of
universal
domination
rome
which
at
every
step
over
the
of
rozan
he
found
at
work
there
whispering
striving
and
conquering
footnote
if
proof
were
wanted
to
show
that
by
rozan
zola
means
rennes
the
fanatical
of
brittany
it
would
be
found
in
the
passage
given
delbos
and
david
advised
him
to
observe
extreme
prudence
they
themselves
were
guarded
by
detectives
for
fear
of
some
ambush
and
he
on
the
very
morrow
of
his
arrival
found
shadowy
forms
hovering
around
him
was
he
not
simon
successor
the
secular
schoolmaster
the
enemy
of
which
the
church
must
rid
itself
if
it
desired
to
triumph
and
the
stealthy
hatred
by
which
marc
felt
himself
to
be
encompassed
the
menace
of
an
evil
blow
in
some
dark
corner
sufficed
to
show
him
that
the
battle
had
sunk
to
the
very
lowest
level
and
that
his
adversaries
were
indeed
those
men
of
blind
bigoted
violence
who
through
the
ages
had
tortured
burnt
and
murdered
their
in
their
mad
dream
of
staying
the
march
of
mankind
that
much
established
marc
understood
the
terror
weighing
on
the
town
the
dismal
aspect
of
its
houses
whose
shutters
remained
closed
as
if
an
epidemic
were
raging
as
a
rule
there
is
little
animation
in
rozan
during
the
summer
and
at
that
moment
the
town
seemed
emptier
than
ever
pedestrians
hastened
their
steps
glancing
anxiously
around
them
as
they
went
their
way
in
the
broad
sunshine
shopkeepers
stood
at
their
windows
inspecting
the
streets
as
if
they
feared
some
massacre
the
selection
of
the
jury
particularly
upset
those
trembling
folk
there
was
much
melancholy
jogging
of
heads
when
the
names
of
the
chosen
jurors
were
made
public
it
was
evidently
considered
a
disaster
to
have
one
among
one
relatives
churchgoers
abounded
among
the
petty
manufacturers
and
tradespeople
of
that
clerical
centre
where
lack
of
religion
was
regarded
as
a
shameful
blot
and
proved
extremely
prejudicial
to
pecuniary
interests
frantic
was
the
pressure
exercised
by
mothers
and
wives
led
by
all
the
priests
abbés
and
monks
of
the
six
parish
churches
and
the
thirty
convents
whose
bells
were
always
ringing
at
beaumont
in
former
times
the
church
had
been
obliged
to
work
with
some
discretion
for
it
had
found
itself
in
the
presence
of
both
an
old
voltairean
and
of
revolutionary
but
there
was
no
need
for
it
to
beat
about
the
bush
in
that
sleepy
city
of
rozan
whose
traditions
were
entirely
pious
the
workmen
wives
went
to
mass
the
women
of
the
middle
class
formed
all
sorts
of
religious
associations
and
thus
a
holy
crusade
began
none
refused
to
help
in
defeating
simon
a
week
before
the
trial
the
whole
town
had
become
a
battlefield
there
was
not
a
house
that
did
not
witness
some
combat
waged
for
the
good
cause
the
wretched
jurors
shut
themselves
up
no
longer
daring
to
go
out
for
strangers
accosted
them
in
the
streets
terrified
them
with
evil
glances
or
passing
words
in
which
there
lurked
a
threat
to
punish
them
in
their
pockets
or
their
persons
if
they
did
not
behave
as
good
catholics
and
the
dirty
jew
marc
was
rendered
yet
more
anxious
by
some
information
he
received
respecting
counsellor
guybaraud
who
was
to
preside
over
the
assize
court
and
procureur
pacart
who
was
to
conduct
the
prosecution
the
first
had
been
a
pupil
of
the
valmarie
jesuits
to
whom
he
owed
his
rapid
promotion
and
had
married
a
very
wealthy
and
very
pious
hunchbacked
girl
whom
he
had
received
from
their
hands
the
latter
an
had
been
vaguely
compromised
in
some
gambling
affair
and
becoming
a
frantic
had
rallied
to
the
church
from
which
he
expected
a
post
in
paris
marc
felt
particularly
distrustful
of
pacart
on
observing
how
insidiously
the
affected
anxiety
respecting
his
attitude
as
if
indeed
they
feared
some
revival
of
his
revolutionary
past
while
they
never
ceased
praising
the
lofty
conscientiousness
of
guybaraud
they
spoke
of
pacart
with
all
sorts
of
reservations
in
order
no
doubt
to
enable
him
to
play
the
heroic
part
of
an
honest
man
overcome
by
the
force
of
truth
on
the
day
when
he
would
have
to
ask
the
jury
for
simon
head
the
very
circumstance
that
the
clericals
went
about
rozan
dolefully
repeating
that
pacart
was
not
on
their
side
made
marc
distrustful
for
information
from
a
good
source
had
acquainted
him
with
the
undoubted
venality
of
this
man
who
was
ready
for
the
vilest
bargaining
in
his
eager
desire
to
regain
a
semblance
of
honour
in
some
high
position
however
the
desperate
and
deadly
battle
became
at
rozan
a
subterranean
one
the
affair
was
not
lightly
prosecuted
in
among
the
smiles
of
ladies
as
at
beaumont
nor
was
there
any
question
of
a
liberal
prelate
like
monseigneur
bergerot
resisting
the
congregations
from
a
dread
lest
the
church
should
be
submerged
and
swept
away
by
the
rising
tide
of
base
superstition
this
time
the
contest
was
carried
on
in
the
darkness
in
which
great
social
crimes
take
their
course
all
that
appeared
on
the
surface
was
some
turbid
ebullition
a
kind
of
terror
sweeping
through
the
streets
as
through
a
city
stricken
with
a
pestilence
and
marc
anguish
arose
particularly
from
that
circumstance
instead
of
again
witnessing
the
resounding
clash
of
simonists
and
as
at
beaumont
he
was
confronted
by
the
stealthy
preparations
for
a
dark
crime
for
which
a
guybaraud
and
a
pacart
were
doubtless
the
necessary
chosen
instruments
every
evening
david
and
delbos
repaired
to
the
large
room
which
marc
had
rented
in
a
lonely
street
and
ardent
friends
of
all
classes
surrounded
them
these
formed
the
little
sacred
phalanx
each
visitor
brought
some
news
contributed
suggestions
and
courage
they
were
determined
that
they
would
not
despair
indeed
after
an
evening
spent
together
they
felt
inspirited
ready
for
fresh
encounters
and
they
were
aware
that
their
enemies
met
in
a
neighbouring
street
at
the
house
of
a
of
judge
gragnon
who
having
been
summoned
as
a
witness
by
the
defence
was
staying
there
receiving
all
the
militant
of
the
town
a
procession
of
frocks
and
gowns
that
slipped
into
the
house
as
soon
as
night
had
fallen
father
crabot
had
slept
there
twice
it
was
said
and
had
then
returned
to
valmarie
where
with
a
great
display
of
humility
he
had
cloistered
himself
in
penitence
suspicious
characters
prowled
about
that
sparsely
populated
district
the
streets
were
not
safe
and
accordingly
when
david
and
delbos
quitted
marc
at
night
their
friends
accompanied
them
home
in
a
band
one
night
a
shot
was
fired
but
the
detectives
though
always
on
the
watch
could
find
nobody
to
arrest
but
the
favourite
weapon
of
the
priests
is
venomous
slander
moral
murder
perpetrated
in
a
cowardly
fashion
in
the
dark
and
delbos
became
the
chosen
victim
on
the
very
day
when
the
trial
was
to
begin
the
number
of
petit
which
reached
rozan
contained
an
abominable
disclosure
full
of
mendacity
a
shamefully
travestied
story
half
a
century
old
about
the
advocate
father
the
elder
delbos
though
of
peasant
stock
had
become
a
goldsmith
in
a
small
way
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
bishop
residence
at
beaumont
and
the
newspaper
charged
him
with
having
made
away
with
certain
sacred
vessels
which
had
been
entrusted
to
him
for
repair
the
truth
was
that
the
goldsmith
robbed
by
a
woman
whom
he
was
unwilling
to
denounce
had
found
himself
obliged
to
pay
the
value
of
the
stolen
goods
there
had
been
no
prosecution
the
affair
had
remained
obscure
but
one
had
to
read
that
filthy
print
to
realise
to
what
depths
of
malevolence
and
ignominy
certain
men
could
descend
that
painful
forgotten
buried
misfortune
of
the
father
was
cast
in
the
face
of
the
son
with
an
abundance
of
spurious
particulars
vile
imaginings
set
forth
in
language
which
was
all
outrage
and
mire
and
the
desecrator
of
the
grave
the
libeller
who
wrote
those
things
had
plainly
obtained
the
documents
he
published
from
the
very
hands
of
father
crabot
to
whom
they
had
been
communicated
no
doubt
by
some
priestly
archivist
it
was
hoped
that
this
unexpected
would
strike
delbos
full
in
the
heart
assassinate
him
morally
discredit
him
as
an
advocate
annihilate
him
to
such
a
point
that
he
would
have
neither
the
strength
to
speak
nor
the
authority
to
gain
a
hearing
in
the
defence
of
simon
however
the
trial
began
one
monday
a
hot
day
in
july
apart
from
gragnon
whom
it
was
intended
to
confront
with
jacquin
the
foreman
of
the
first
jury
several
witnesses
had
been
cited
for
the
defence
mignot
mlle
rouzaire
daix
mauraisin
salvan
sébastien
and
victor
milhomme
polydor
souquet
the
younger
bongards
doloirs
and
savins
were
all
on
the
list
fathers
crabot
and
philibin
brothers
fulgence
and
gorgias
had
also
been
cited
though
it
was
known
that
the
last
three
would
not
appear
on
the
other
side
the
procureur
de
la
république
had
contented
himself
with
recalling
the
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
who
had
given
evidence
at
the
first
trial
and
the
streets
of
rozan
had
at
last
become
animated
with
witnesses
journalists
and
inquisitive
folk
arriving
in
fresh
batches
by
each
succeeding
train
already
at
six
in
the
morning
a
crowd
assembled
near
the
palace
of
justice
eager
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
simon
but
a
considerable
military
force
had
been
set
on
foot
the
street
was
cleared
and
simon
crossed
it
between
two
rows
of
soldiers
set
so
closely
together
that
none
of
the
onlookers
could
distinguish
his
features
it
was
then
eight
that
early
hour
had
been
chosen
in
order
to
avoid
the
oppressive
heat
of
the
afterpart
of
the
day
when
one
would
have
stifled
in
the
the
scene
was
very
different
from
that
presented
by
the
brand
new
of
beaumont
where
a
profusion
of
gilding
had
glittered
in
the
crude
light
that
streamed
in
by
the
lofty
windows
at
rozan
the
assizes
were
held
in
an
ancient
feudal
castle
the
hall
was
small
and
low
panelled
with
old
oak
and
scarcely
lighted
by
the
windows
of
a
few
deep
bays
one
might
have
thought
the
place
to
be
one
of
those
dark
chapels
where
the
inquisition
pronounced
sentence
only
a
few
ladies
could
possibly
be
admitted
and
all
of
them
moreover
wore
sombre
garb
most
of
the
seats
were
occupied
by
the
witnesses
and
even
the
little
usually
allowed
to
the
public
had
to
be
curtailed
the
audience
packed
since
seven
in
that
stern
and
mournful
room
preserved
a
relative
silence
through
which
swept
a
stealthy
quiver
if
the
eyes
of
the
onlookers
remained
ardent
their
gestures
were
restrained
they
had
come
there
for
a
subterranean
execution
a
work
of
suppression
which
had
to
be
accomplished
far
from
the
light
with
the
least
noise
possible
as
soon
as
marc
was
seated
beside
david
who
went
in
with
the
witnesses
he
experienced
a
feeling
of
anguish
a
stifling
sensation
as
if
the
walls
were
about
to
crumble
and
bury
them
he
had
seen
all
eyes
turn
in
their
direction
david
particularly
aroused
great
curiosity
then
marc
felt
moved
for
delbos
had
just
come
in
looking
pale
but
resolute
amid
the
evil
glances
of
most
of
the
spectators
who
were
eager
to
ascertain
if
he
had
been
upset
by
the
infamous
article
which
had
appeared
that
morning
however
the
advocate
as
if
arrayed
in
an
armour
of
valour
and
contempt
remained
for
some
time
standing
there
displaying
only
smiling
strength
and
indifference
marc
then
interested
himself
in
the
jurors
scrutinising
them
as
they
entered
one
by
one
anxious
as
he
was
to
ascertain
to
what
kind
of
men
the
great
task
of
reparation
was
confided
and
he
perceived
the
insignificant
faces
of
various
petty
tradespeople
petty
with
a
chemist
a
veterinary
surgeon
and
two
retired
captains
on
all
those
faces
one
found
an
expression
of
mournful
disquietude
the
signs
of
a
desire
to
hide
internal
perturbation
the
worries
which
had
assailed
those
men
since
their
names
had
become
known
had
pursued
them
to
that
hall
several
had
the
wan
countenances
of
devotees
of
shaven
canting
beadles
while
others
red
and
corpulent
looked
as
if
they
had
doubled
their
usual
ration
of
brandy
that
morning
in
order
to
instil
a
little
courage
into
their
paunches
behind
them
one
could
divine
the
entirety
of
that
old
priestly
and
military
city
with
its
convents
and
its
barracks
and
one
shuddered
to
think
that
those
men
whose
minds
and
consciences
had
been
deformed
stifled
by
their
surroundings
should
be
entrusted
with
such
a
work
of
justice
but
a
buzzing
spread
through
the
hall
and
all
at
once
marc
experienced
the
most
poignant
thrill
of
emotion
he
had
ever
known
he
had
not
seen
simon
since
his
return
and
now
he
suddenly
perceived
him
standing
behind
delbos
and
terrible
was
the
apparition
of
that
bent
and
emaciated
little
man
with
ravaged
features
and
bald
cranium
on
which
only
a
few
scanty
white
locks
remained
what
that
wreck
that
puny
remnant
of
a
man
was
his
old
comrade
whom
he
had
known
so
vivacious
and
refined
if
simon
had
never
possessed
any
great
physical
gifts
if
his
voice
had
been
weak
his
gestures
inelegant
at
least
a
brazier
of
youth
and
faith
had
glowed
within
him
and
the
galleys
had
only
given
back
that
poor
broken
crushed
being
a
mere
shred
of
humanity
in
whom
nought
of
the
past
subsisted
save
two
flaming
eyes
which
alone
proclaimed
the
invincible
will
and
courage
he
preserved
one
recognised
him
only
by
those
eyes
and
they
too
explained
how
he
had
been
able
for
so
many
years
to
resist
suffering
for
their
expression
told
of
the
world
of
fancy
of
pure
ideality
in
which
he
had
always
lived
every
glance
was
turned
upon
him
but
he
did
not
seem
conscious
of
it
such
was
the
power
he
possessed
of
isolating
himself
he
gazed
at
the
assembly
in
an
way
until
at
last
a
smile
of
infinite
tenderness
came
over
his
face
as
he
perceived
his
brother
david
marc
who
sat
beside
the
latter
then
felt
him
tremble
in
every
limb
it
was
a
quarter
past
eight
when
the
usher
call
rang
out
and
the
court
entered
the
assembly
arose
and
then
sat
down
again
marc
who
remembered
the
violence
of
the
spectators
at
beaumont
who
from
growls
had
passed
to
vociferations
was
astonished
by
the
heavy
quietude
preserved
by
the
present
onlookers
though
he
divined
that
they
were
swayed
by
the
same
passions
and
remained
mutely
eager
for
slaughter
as
if
they
were
lying
in
ambush
in
some
sombre
nook
the
sight
of
the
prisoner
had
scarcely
wrung
a
low
murmur
from
them
and
now
while
the
judges
took
their
seats
they
relapsed
into
their
attitude
of
dark
expectancy
again
compared
with
the
rough
and
jovial
gragnon
the
new
presiding
judge
guybaraud
surprised
one
by
his
perfect
courtesy
his
unctuous
gestures
his
insinuating
speech
he
was
a
little
man
whose
manner
was
all
smiles
and
gentleness
but
an
odour
of
the
sacristies
seemed
to
emanate
from
his
person
and
his
grey
eyes
were
as
cold
and
as
cutting
as
steel
nor
was
the
difference
less
remarkable
between
the
former
procureur
de
la
république
the
brilliant
raoul
de
la
bissonnière
and
pacart
the
present
one
who
was
very
long
slender
and
lean
with
a
yellow
baked
face
as
if
he
were
consumed
by
a
desire
to
efface
his
equivocal
past
and
make
a
rapid
fortune
after
the
first
formalities
when
the
jury
had
been
empanelled
an
usher
called
the
names
of
the
witnesses
who
one
by
one
withdrew
marc
like
the
others
had
to
leave
the
hall
then
in
a
leisurely
way
president
guybaraud
began
to
interrogate
simon
putting
his
questions
in
a
tone
of
voice
that
suggested
the
coldness
of
a
blade
handled
with
deadly
skill
and
precision
that
interminable
examination
which
lingered
over
the
slightest
incidents
of
the
old
affair
and
insisted
on
the
charge
which
the
inquiry
of
the
court
of
cassation
had
destroyed
proved
quite
a
surprise
some
clearing
of
the
ground
an
examination
on
the
questions
set
by
the
supreme
jurisdiction
was
all
that
had
been
expected
but
it
at
once
became
evident
that
the
assize
court
of
rozan
did
not
intend
to
take
any
account
of
the
facts
established
by
that
jurisdiction
and
that
the
presiding
judge
meant
to
avail
himself
of
his
discretionary
powers
to
deal
with
the
entire
case
from
the
very
beginning
soon
indeed
by
the
questions
which
he
asked
one
understood
that
nothing
of
the
old
indictment
had
been
relinquished
it
was
again
alleged
that
simon
had
returned
from
beaumont
by
rail
that
he
had
reached
maillebois
at
twenty
minutes
to
eleven
and
that
soon
afterwards
he
had
committed
the
crime
at
this
point
however
the
new
version
of
the
jesuits
necessitated
by
the
discovery
at
father
philibin
was
interpolated
and
the
prisoner
was
accused
of
having
procured
a
of
having
caused
a
false
stamp
to
be
made
and
of
having
forged
on
the
slip
the
initials
of
brother
gorgias
thus
that
childish
story
which
gorgias
himself
had
deemed
so
idiotic
that
he
had
admitted
the
authenticity
of
the
slip
and
the
paraph
was
retained
while
nothing
was
abandoned
of
the
original
charges
a
gross
invention
was
brought
forward
in
support
of
them
and
everything
was
again
based
on
the
famous
report
of
the
experts
masters
badoche
and
trabut
who
clung
to
their
original
statements
in
spite
of
brother
gorgias
formal
admissions
and
the
procureur
de
la
république
as
if
to
leave
no
doubt
of
his
own
views
intervened
in
order
to
extract
precise
statements
from
the
prisoner
with
respect
to
his
denials
on
the
question
of
the
false
stamp
simon
demeanour
during
that
long
examination
was
regarded
as
pitiful
many
of
his
partisans
had
dreamt
of
him
as
a
justiciar
armed
with
the
thunderbolts
of
heaven
and
rising
like
an
avenger
from
the
grave
into
which
he
had
been
thrust
by
iniquitous
hands
and
as
he
answered
politely
in
a
voice
which
still
quivered
feverishly
and
with
none
of
the
outbursts
that
had
been
anticipated
the
disappointment
was
extreme
his
enemies
once
more
began
to
say
that
he
virtually
confessed
his
crime
the
ignominy
of
which
they
found
stamped
upon
his
unprepossessing
countenance
only
at
one
moment
did
he
become
excited
display
any
passionate
fervour
this
was
when
the
judge
spoke
to
him
of
the
false
stamp
of
which
he
heard
for
the
first
time
it
should
be
added
that
no
proof
was
supplied
respecting
that
stamp
the
prosecution
contented
itself
with
relating
that
an
unknown
workman
had
confided
to
a
woman
that
he
had
secretly
done
a
curious
job
for
the
schoolmaster
of
maillebois
confronted
however
by
the
sudden
violence
of
simon
the
judge
did
not
insist
on
the
point
particularly
as
delbos
had
risen
prepared
to
raise
an
and
the
public
prosecutor
merely
added
that
though
they
had
failed
to
find
the
unknown
workman
he
reserved
to
himself
the
right
of
insisting
on
the
serious
probability
of
the
alleged
occurrence
in
the
evening
when
david
related
what
had
occurred
at
that
first
sitting
marc
who
divined
some
fresh
iniquity
felt
a
pang
at
the
heart
assuredly
the
greatest
crime
of
all
was
now
in
preparation
he
was
not
astonished
by
the
calm
and
unobtrusive
bearing
of
simon
who
was
confident
in
the
strength
of
his
innocence
and
incapable
of
an
outward
show
of
emotion
but
he
perfectly
understood
the
bad
effect
which
had
been
produced
while
from
the
aggressive
coldness
of
the
presiding
judge
and
the
importance
the
latter
gave
to
the
most
trivial
matters
already
elucidated
he
derived
a
disastrous
impression
a
that
a
fresh
conviction
was
impending
on
hearing
him
david
from
whom
he
thought
it
wrong
to
hide
his
anxiety
could
only
with
difficulty
restrain
his
tears
for
he
also
had
quitted
the
palace
of
justice
in
despair
full
of
a
dreadful
presentiment
footnote
this
was
a
marked
characteristic
of
the
unfortunate
captain
dreyfus
whose
demeanour
at
the
trial
at
rennes
produced
such
an
unfavourable
impression
on
sundry
foolish
english
correspondents
that
they
veered
round
and
began
to
regard
the
prisoner
as
guilty
quite
irrespective
of
the
evidence
as
one
who
has
witnessed
many
criminal
trials
who
has
been
a
juror
and
the
foreman
of
a
jury
i
feel
that
everything
that
has
been
written
to
my
knowledge
in
english
literature
respecting
the
demeanour
of
an
innocent
man
is
nonsense
and
nothing
however
the
following
days
which
were
entirely
devoted
to
the
hearing
of
evidence
brought
back
some
courage
and
illusion
the
former
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
were
first
examined
and
one
again
beheld
a
procession
of
railway
employés
and
officials
who
contradicted
one
another
on
the
question
whether
simon
on
the
night
of
the
crime
had
returned
to
maillebois
by
train
or
on
foot
marc
who
wished
to
follow
the
case
had
asked
delbos
to
have
him
called
as
soon
as
possible
and
this
being
done
he
gave
evidence
respecting
the
discovery
of
poor
little
zéphirin
body
he
was
then
able
to
seat
himself
once
more
beside
david
who
still
occupied
a
corner
of
the
small
space
allotted
to
the
witnesses
and
thus
marc
was
present
at
the
first
raised
by
the
counsel
for
the
defence
who
had
retained
all
his
bravery
and
in
spite
of
the
cruel
blow
which
had
lately
struck
him
in
the
heart
he
rose
to
demand
the
attendance
of
father
philibin
and
brothers
fulgence
and
gorgias
who
said
he
had
been
duly
cited
but
the
presiding
judge
briefly
explained
that
the
citations
had
reached
neither
father
philibin
nor
brother
gorgias
both
of
whom
no
doubt
were
abroad
though
their
exact
whereabouts
was
not
known
as
for
brother
fulgence
he
was
seriously
ill
and
had
sent
a
medical
certificate
to
that
effect
delbos
insisted
however
with
respect
to
brother
fulgence
and
ended
by
obtaining
a
promise
that
he
should
be
visited
by
a
sworn
medical
man
then
also
the
advocate
was
unwilling
to
content
himself
with
a
letter
in
which
father
crabot
while
urging
his
occupations
his
confessional
duties
as
an
excuse
for
absence
declared
that
he
knew
nothing
whatever
of
the
affair
and
in
spite
of
the
acrimonious
intervention
of
the
procureur
de
la
république
delbos
again
carried
his
point
that
the
court
should
insist
on
the
attendance
of
the
rector
of
valmarie
however
this
first
collision
fomented
anger
and
from
that
moment
conflicts
continually
arose
between
the
judge
and
the
advocate
the
day
sitting
ended
amidst
an
outburst
of
emotion
occasioned
by
the
unexpected
character
of
the
evidence
given
by
mignot
mademoiselle
rouzaire
as
bitter
and
as
positive
as
ever
had
just
reaffirmed
that
at
about
twenty
minutes
to
eleven
she
had
heard
the
footsteps
and
the
voice
of
simon
coming
in
and
speaking
with
zéphirin
which
evidence
had
weighed
so
heavily
on
the
prisoner
at
the
previous
trial
when
mignot
following
her
at
the
bar
retracted
the
whole
of
his
former
statements
in
a
tone
of
wondrous
frankness
and
emotion
he
had
heard
nothing
he
was
now
convinced
of
innocence
and
adduced
the
weightiest
reasons
mademoiselle
rouzaire
was
then
recalled
and
there
came
a
dramatic
confrontation
in
which
the
schoolmistress
ended
by
losing
ground
becoming
embarrassed
in
her
estimate
of
the
hour
and
finding
nothing
to
answer
when
mignot
pointed
out
that
it
was
impossible
to
hear
from
her
room
anything
that
took
place
in
little
zéphirin
marc
was
recalled
to
confirm
demonstration
and
at
the
bar
he
found
himself
for
a
moment
beside
inspector
mauraisin
who
being
asked
for
his
opinion
respecting
the
prisoner
and
the
witnesses
endeavoured
to
get
out
of
his
difficulty
by
indulging
in
extravagant
praise
of
mademoiselle
rouzaire
merits
while
saying
nothing
particular
against
mignot
or
marc
or
even
simon
at
a
loss
as
he
was
to
tell
what
turn
the
case
might
take
the
next
two
sittings
of
the
court
proved
even
better
for
the
defence
the
question
of
hearing
a
part
of
the
evidence
which
had
impassioned
people
at
the
first
trial
was
not
even
put
for
the
presiding
judge
did
not
dare
to
raise
it
it
was
in
public
that
he
interrogated
simon
former
pupils
boys
at
the
time
of
the
crime
but
now
grown
men
for
the
most
part
married
fernand
bongard
auguste
and
charles
doloir
achille
and
philippe
savin
came
in
succession
to
relate
the
little
they
remembered
and
their
statements
were
favourable
to
the
prisoner
rather
than
the
reverse
thus
ended
the
abominable
legend
built
up
by
the
help
of
the
former
proceedings
the
legend
of
horrible
charges
with
which
it
had
been
said
one
could
not
possibly
soil
the
ears
of
an
audience
composed
partially
of
women
however
the
sensational
evidence
of
the
sitting
was
that
given
by
sébastien
and
victor
milhomme
in
accents
of
emotion
sébastien
now
two
and
twenty
years
of
age
explained
the
falsehood
of
his
childhood
the
alarm
of
his
mother
the
suppression
of
the
truth
which
he
and
she
had
expiated
after
prolonged
torture
and
he
stated
the
facts
such
as
they
really
were
how
he
had
seen
a
in
the
hands
of
his
cousin
victor
how
that
slip
had
disappeared
how
it
had
been
found
again
and
given
up
when
his
mother
beside
his
bed
of
sickness
had
deemed
herself
punished
for
her
bad
action
as
for
victor
when
his
turn
came
to
testify
in
order
to
please
his
mother
who
did
not
wish
to
compromise
the
stationery
business
any
further
he
feigned
total
forgetfulness
the
obtuseness
of
a
big
fellow
who
had
no
memory
no
doubt
he
must
have
brought
the
from
the
brothers
school
as
it
had
been
found
but
he
knew
nothing
he
could
say
nothing
further
finally
another
of
the
brothers
former
pupils
polydor
souquet
now
a
servant
in
a
beaumont
convent
appeared
at
the
bar
and
was
questioned
very
pressingly
by
delbos
respecting
the
manner
in
which
brother
gorgias
had
escorted
him
home
on
the
night
of
the
crime
the
incidents
which
had
occurred
on
the
road
the
words
that
had
been
exchanged
and
the
hour
but
all
that
delbos
could
extract
from
polydor
were
some
evasive
answers
and
malicious
glances
promptly
tempered
by
an
affectation
of
stupidity
how
could
one
remember
after
so
many
years
the
witness
asked
the
excuse
was
too
convenient
and
the
procureur
de
la
république
began
to
show
signs
of
anxious
impatience
while
the
onlookers
though
they
failed
to
understand
why
the
advocate
insisted
so
much
with
an
apparently
insignificant
witness
felt
as
it
were
a
quiver
of
the
truth
passing
through
the
atmosphere
the
truth
suspected
but
once
more
taking
flight
people
were
stirred
again
at
the
next
sitting
of
the
court
though
it
began
with
the
interminable
demonstrations
of
the
experts
masters
badoche
and
trabut
who
disregarding
even
the
admissions
of
brother
gorgias
himself
obstinately
refused
to
recognise
his
initials
an
f
and
a
g
in
the
incriminated
paraph
in
which
they
alone
recognised
those
of
simon
an
e
and
an
s
interlaced
but
it
was
true
illegible
for
more
than
three
hours
these
men
piled
argument
upon
argument
demonstration
on
demonstration
calmly
persevering
in
their
lunacy
and
the
marvel
was
that
the
presiding
judge
allowed
them
to
go
on
and
listened
to
them
with
manifest
complacency
while
the
procureur
made
a
show
of
taking
notes
and
asked
the
experts
for
precise
information
on
certain
points
as
if
the
prosecution
still
adopted
their
system
in
presence
of
this
even
reasonable
people
in
the
hall
began
to
hesitate
and
after
all
why
not
for
in
matters
of
handwriting
one
could
never
tell
but
at
the
close
of
the
sitting
an
incident
which
did
not
last
ten
minutes
upset
everybody
clad
in
black
from
head
to
foot
magistrate
daix
who
had
been
cited
by
the
defence
appeared
at
the
bar
he
was
scarcely
years
old
but
he
looked
seventy
thin
and
bent
his
hair
quite
white
his
face
so
emaciated
that
little
of
it
save
the
slender
nose
seemed
to
remain
he
had
lately
lost
his
wife
and
people
talked
of
the
torturing
life
which
that
ugly
coquettish
ambitious
woman
had
led
him
in
her
despair
that
nothing
ever
raised
them
from
their
narrow
circumstances
not
even
the
condemnation
of
that
jew
simon
on
which
she
had
insisted
and
from
which
she
had
hoped
to
derive
so
much
and
now
that
his
wife
was
no
longer
beside
him
daix
timid
and
anxious
painstaking
in
his
profession
an
honest
man
at
heart
had
come
there
to
relieve
his
conscience
distracted
as
he
was
by
the
deeds
which
had
been
wrung
from
his
weakness
his
craving
to
have
peace
at
home
he
did
not
positively
speak
of
all
those
things
he
did
not
even
admit
that
after
his
investigations
he
had
felt
that
the
only
possible
decision
was
an
order
to
stay
further
proceedings
but
he
allowed
delbos
to
question
him
and
when
his
present
opinion
was
asked
he
replied
plainly
that
the
inquiry
of
the
court
of
cassation
had
destroyed
his
work
the
original
indictment
and
that
for
his
own
part
he
now
regarded
simon
as
innocent
then
he
withdrew
amidst
the
silent
stupefaction
of
the
onlookers
the
apparition
of
that
man
in
mourning
garb
the
admissions
made
by
him
in
slow
and
sorrowful
accents
had
stirred
every
heart
that
evening
in
marc
large
room
where
simon
friends
met
after
every
sitting
of
the
court
in
order
to
discuss
matters
delbos
and
david
expressed
keen
satisfaction
a
conviction
that
success
was
almost
certain
now
so
great
apparently
was
the
impression
which
daix
evidence
had
produced
on
the
jury
nevertheless
marc
remained
anxious
he
told
the
others
of
certain
rumours
which
were
circulating
concerning
the
stealthy
doings
of
gragnon
who
had
been
carrying
on
a
subterranean
campaign
ever
since
his
arrival
at
rozan
marc
was
aware
that
even
as
the
friends
of
the
defence
met
in
his
own
room
in
like
way
mysterious
meetings
took
place
every
night
at
gragnon
in
an
adjoining
street
and
there
the
partisans
of
the
prosecution
certainly
decided
on
the
line
they
would
pursue
on
the
morrow
invented
the
answers
which
it
would
be
best
to
give
planned
the
incidents
which
they
felt
ought
to
be
raised
in
particular
preparing
the
evidence
in
accordance
with
the
result
of
the
day
sitting
for
instance
whenever
that
sitting
was
regarded
as
unfavourable
to
the
prosecution
one
might
be
sure
that
there
would
be
some
surprise
detrimental
to
the
prisoner
at
the
outset
of
the
sitting
on
the
morrow
moreover
father
crabot
had
been
again
seen
slipping
into
gragnon
house
several
people
also
declared
that
they
had
seen
young
polydor
souquet
leaving
it
and
others
alleged
that
at
a
very
late
hour
they
had
met
in
the
street
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
who
looked
extremely
like
mademoiselle
rouzaire
and
inspector
mauraisin
but
the
worst
was
some
mysterious
work
which
centred
round
those
jurors
who
were
notoriously
on
the
side
of
the
church
and
of
which
marc
obtained
an
inkling
though
his
informant
could
not
give
him
full
particulars
gragnon
did
not
commit
such
a
blunder
as
to
ask
those
men
to
call
at
his
house
nor
did
he
indeed
address
himself
to
them
personally
but
he
made
others
call
on
them
and
show
them
so
it
was
said
an
irrefutable
proof
of
simon
guilt
a
terrible
document
which
the
most
serious
reasons
prevented
him
from
making
public
though
he
was
resolved
to
employ
it
all
the
same
should
the
defence
drive
him
to
extremities
and
this
information
made
marc
feel
anxious
for
he
scented
some
fresh
abomination
in
it
thus
on
the
evening
of
the
day
when
daix
had
dealt
the
prosecution
such
a
severe
blow
he
predicted
to
his
friends
some
deed
of
retaliation
on
the
enemy
part
some
sample
of
the
thunder
which
gragnon
according
to
his
own
account
had
in
his
pocket
the
following
sitting
of
the
court
was
indeed
one
of
the
gravest
and
most
exciting
jacquin
the
foreman
of
the
first
jury
in
his
turn
came
forward
to
relieve
his
conscience
in
simple
language
he
related
how
president
gragnon
on
being
summoned
by
the
jurors
who
had
wished
to
consult
him
respecting
the
penalty
attaching
to
their
verdict
had
entered
their
room
carrying
a
letter
and
looking
very
much
disturbed
and
he
had
shown
them
that
letter
which
bore
simon
signature
followed
by
a
postscriptum
and
a
paraph
which
last
was
identical
with
the
one
on
the
tendered
as
evidence
several
jurymen
who
had
hesitated
previously
then
declared
themselves
convinced
of
the
prisoner
guilt
he
jacquin
had
retained
no
further
doubts
and
for
the
peace
of
his
conscience
he
had
been
well
pleased
at
thus
acquiring
certainty
at
that
time
he
had
not
known
that
such
a
communication
was
illegal
it
was
only
later
that
he
had
discovered
such
to
be
the
case
and
had
experienced
great
distress
of
mind
until
at
last
the
postscriptum
and
the
paraph
being
recognised
as
forgeries
he
had
resolved
like
a
good
christian
to
make
amends
for
his
involuntary
error
a
shudder
of
awe
sped
through
those
who
heard
him
when
in
his
quiet
way
he
added
a
last
detail
he
had
heard
the
very
voice
of
jesus
telling
him
to
speak
out
one
evening
when
tortured
by
remorse
he
was
kneeling
in
a
dim
chapel
of
maxence
then
gragnon
was
summoned
to
the
bar
and
at
first
tried
the
effect
of
the
rough
frankness
which
he
had
so
often
assumed
in
his
browbeating
judicial
days
he
was
still
fat
though
his
fears
had
made
him
pale
and
striving
to
hide
his
prolonged
anguish
beneath
the
impudence
of
a
he
pretended
that
he
no
longer
remembered
petty
details
and
well
yes
he
believed
he
had
gone
into
the
jurors
room
carrying
the
letter
which
he
had
just
received
he
had
been
upset
by
it
and
had
shown
it
to
the
others
in
a
moment
of
emotion
scarcely
realising
the
nature
of
his
action
and
being
only
desirous
of
establishing
the
truth
he
had
never
regretted
that
communication
so
fully
was
he
convinced
of
the
authenticity
of
the
postscript
and
the
paraph
in
his
opinion
the
assertion
that
they
were
forgeries
remained
to
be
proved
then
as
he
formally
charged
jacquin
with
having
read
the
letter
aloud
to
the
other
jurors
and
of
having
commented
on
it
the
was
recalled
and
a
sharp
dispute
ensued
at
last
gragnon
convicted
the
architect
of
some
error
or
forgetfulness
respecting
the
perusal
of
the
letter
and
thereupon
he
triumphed
while
the
spectators
began
to
hiss
the
honest
witness
who
from
that
moment
was
suspected
of
having
sold
himself
to
the
jews
in
vain
did
delbos
repeatedly
intervene
striving
to
exasperate
gragnon
and
unmask
him
by
forcing
him
to
an
explosion
the
production
of
the
famous
document
which
it
was
said
would
clench
everything
the
who
retained
all
his
and
who
was
satisfied
with
having
escaped
immediate
danger
by
casting
a
doubt
on
his
adversary
veracity
relapsed
into
evasive
answers
it
was
noticed
however
that
one
of
the
jurors
caused
a
question
to
be
put
to
him
a
question
which
nobody
understood
but
which
was
whether
he
did
not
possess
some
knowledge
of
another
document
bearing
on
the
authenticity
of
the
gragnon
answered
enigmatically
that
he
abided
by
his
previous
declarations
and
was
unwilling
to
enter
into
other
matters
however
certain
they
might
be
and
thus
that
sitting
of
the
court
which
at
the
outset
had
seemed
likely
to
ruin
the
prosecution
ended
to
its
advantage
in
marc
room
in
the
evening
simon
friends
again
began
to
despair
the
examination
of
the
witnesses
dragged
on
during
a
few
more
sittings
the
doctor
appointed
to
visit
brother
fulgence
had
returned
with
a
report
that
the
brother
condition
was
very
serious
and
that
it
was
impossible
to
bring
him
to
rozan
in
like
manner
father
crabot
avoided
the
embarrassment
of
attendance
by
feigning
a
sudden
accident
a
severe
sprain
in
vain
did
delbos
make
an
application
for
his
evidence
to
be
taken
by
commission
president
guybaraud
who
at
the
outset
had
shown
himself
so
phlegmatic
now
sabred
everybody
and
everything
in
his
eagerness
to
bring
the
case
to
an
end
he
treated
simon
harshly
as
if
indeed
he
were
already
a
condemned
man
being
emboldened
to
this
course
by
the
singular
calmness
of
the
prisoner
who
still
listened
to
the
witnesses
with
curiosity
and
stupefaction
as
if
the
extraordinary
adventures
of
somebody
else
were
being
recounted
to
him
only
on
two
or
three
occasions
did
some
extremely
mendacious
testimony
prompt
him
to
a
little
rebellion
for
the
most
part
he
contented
himself
with
smiling
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
at
last
pacart
the
procureur
de
la
république
addressed
the
court
tall
and
thin
he
was
addicted
to
long
nervous
gestures
and
affected
an
unadorned
mathematically
precise
kind
of
eloquence
in
presence
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
cassation
his
task
was
not
easy
but
his
tactics
were
very
simple
he
took
no
account
of
that
judgment
he
did
not
once
allude
to
the
long
inquiry
which
had
ended
in
a
decision
to
send
the
affair
for
trial
by
another
assize
court
he
quietly
reverted
to
the
old
indictment
based
himself
on
the
report
of
the
experts
and
accepted
the
revised
account
of
the
holding
that
the
as
well
as
the
initialling
had
been
forged
he
even
spoke
of
that
stamp
in
a
positive
way
as
if
he
held
a
proof
that
it
had
been
forged
but
could
not
produce
it
as
for
brother
gorgias
he
regarded
him
simply
as
an
unfortunate
man
perhaps
mentally
unhinged
assuredly
in
need
and
of
a
passionate
nature
one
who
after
proving
an
undisciplined
and
compromising
son
of
the
church
had
quitted
it
and
sold
himself
to
the
jews
and
pacart
concluded
by
asking
the
jurors
to
put
an
end
to
this
affair
which
was
so
disastrous
for
the
peace
of
the
country
by
saying
once
more
on
which
side
the
culprit
really
was
whether
among
the
anarchists
and
the
cosmopolites
who
sought
to
destroy
all
belief
in
god
and
country
or
among
the
men
upholding
faith
respect
and
tradition
to
whom
for
ages
past
france
had
owed
her
grandeur
then
delbos
spoke
during
two
sittings
eager
and
nervous
endowed
with
passionate
eloquence
he
also
dealt
with
the
affair
from
the
very
beginning
but
he
did
so
in
order
to
destroy
the
allegations
in
the
old
indictment
with
the
help
of
the
arguments
supplied
by
the
court
of
cassation
inquiry
not
one
of
those
allegations
was
worth
anything
it
was
proved
that
simon
had
returned
home
on
foot
on
the
night
of
the
crime
that
he
had
reached
maillebois
at
twenty
minutes
to
twelve
an
hour
after
the
crime
had
been
committed
again
there
was
proof
that
the
had
been
stamped
at
the
brothers
school
and
initialled
by
brother
gorgias
whose
admissions
on
the
subject
were
not
even
necessary
for
counter
experts
in
a
memorable
report
addressed
to
the
court
of
cassation
had
destroyed
the
extraordinary
farrago
of
masters
badoche
and
trabut
then
delbos
turned
to
the
new
story
of
the
forged
stamp
no
proof
of
this
had
been
supplied
nevertheless
he
insisted
on
the
subject
for
he
divined
that
some
supreme
abomination
lurked
beneath
all
that
stealthy
manœuvring
compounded
of
mere
allegation
and
reticence
a
sick
workman
it
was
said
had
told
a
woman
a
vague
story
about
a
stamp
which
he
had
made
for
the
maillebois
schoolmaster
where
was
that
woman
who
was
she
what
was
her
calling
as
nobody
would
or
could
reply
he
delbos
had
a
right
to
conclude
that
this
story
was
one
of
those
absurd
lies
such
as
petit
was
in
the
habit
of
retailing
however
if
he
was
able
to
picture
the
whole
crime
as
it
must
have
taken
place
brother
gorgias
returning
after
he
had
escorted
polydor
home
pausing
before
zéphirin
open
window
finally
entering
the
room
and
at
last
succumbing
to
his
ungovernable
passions
he
admitted
that
there
was
a
gap
in
his
narrative
where
had
gorgias
found
the
for
the
rascal
was
right
when
he
jeeringly
inquired
if
schoolmasters
usually
walked
about
in
the
evening
with
in
their
pockets
undoubtedly
the
number
of
petit
had
been
in
the
pocket
of
his
own
cassock
whence
he
had
taken
it
in
order
to
gag
his
victim
and
the
slip
must
have
been
there
also
but
how
had
that
happened
delbos
suspected
the
truth
and
if
he
had
questioned
polydor
souquet
so
pressingly
it
was
in
order
to
extract
it
from
him
he
had
failed
in
that
endeavour
the
witness
having
met
him
with
an
assumption
of
hypocritical
stupidity
but
after
all
what
did
that
obscure
point
matter
was
not
gorgias
guilt
absolutely
manifest
his
alleged
alibi
was
based
solely
on
a
series
of
false
statements
everything
proved
his
guilt
his
flight
his
the
criminal
efforts
made
to
save
him
and
the
dispersal
of
his
accomplices
father
philibin
hiding
himself
in
some
italian
convent
brother
fulgence
seeking
refuge
at
a
distance
and
shielding
himself
with
a
diplomatic
illness
and
father
crabot
withdrawing
to
his
cell
where
providence
had
visited
him
with
a
very
salutary
sprain
was
it
not
also
in
order
to
save
gorgias
that
president
gragnon
had
illegally
communicated
a
forgery
to
the
first
jurors
as
had
been
proved
by
the
evidence
of
architect
jacquin
amidst
the
accumulation
of
crimes
that
one
alone
ought
to
have
sufficed
to
open
the
eyes
of
the
most
prejudiced
and
delbos
ended
by
depicting
the
frightful
sufferings
experienced
by
simon
the
fifteen
years
of
transportation
which
he
had
endured
amidst
the
most
cruel
physical
and
moral
tortures
while
ever
stubbornly
raising
his
cry
of
innocence
the
advocate
added
that
like
the
procureur
de
la
république
he
also
desired
to
have
the
affair
ended
but
ended
by
an
act
of
justice
which
would
redound
to
the
honour
of
france
for
if
the
innocent
man
should
be
struck
down
again
the
shame
of
france
would
be
indescribable
and
a
future
full
of
incalculable
evils
would
lie
before
her
there
was
no
reply
from
the
prosecution
the
case
was
closed
and
the
jury
at
once
withdrew
to
its
it
was
about
eleven
in
the
morning
and
for
more
than
an
hour
the
spectators
remained
waiting
silent
and
anxious
in
no
wise
resembling
the
audience
at
beaumont
which
had
been
so
tumultuous
and
violent
the
hall
was
very
hot
and
the
atmosphere
seemed
as
heavy
as
lead
there
was
little
conversation
though
occasionally
the
simonists
and
the
glanced
askance
at
one
another
one
might
have
fancied
oneself
in
some
funeral
chamber
where
the
life
or
death
of
a
nation
the
whole
dolorous
question
of
its
future
was
being
decided
at
last
the
jury
reappeared
the
judges
came
in
and
amidst
lugubrious
silence
the
foreman
arose
he
was
a
little
grey
lean
man
a
goldsmith
enjoying
the
custom
of
the
local
clergy
his
shrill
voice
was
distinctly
heard
on
the
question
of
guilt
the
verdict
was
by
a
majority
while
circumstances
were
unanimously
granted
at
beaumont
the
jury
had
been
unanimous
with
respect
to
guilt
and
only
a
small
majority
had
favoured
the
admission
of
extenuating
circumstances
and
now
after
expediting
the
formalities
president
guybaraud
hastily
pronounced
a
sentence
of
ten
years
solitary
confinement
that
done
he
withdrew
and
pacart
the
procureur
de
la
république
followed
him
after
bowing
to
the
jury
as
if
to
thank
them
footnote
at
french
criminal
trials
the
judges
no
longer
sum
up
the
evidence
before
the
verdict
is
given
that
privilege
was
taken
from
them
by
a
special
law
several
years
ago
in
consequence
of
their
scandalous
abuse
of
marc
meantime
had
glanced
at
simon
on
whose
face
he
only
detected
a
kind
of
faint
smile
a
painful
contraction
of
the
lips
delbos
beside
himself
was
clenching
his
fists
david
whose
emotion
was
too
intense
had
not
returned
into
court
but
was
awaiting
the
decision
outside
the
thunderbolt
had
fallen
and
marc
felt
a
deadly
chill
in
every
vein
it
was
a
frigid
horror
the
supreme
iniquity
in
which
just
minds
had
refused
to
believe
the
crime
of
crimes
which
had
seemed
impossible
a
few
hours
earlier
which
reason
had
rejected
had
suddenly
become
a
monstrous
reality
and
there
were
no
ferocious
cries
of
joy
there
was
no
onslaught
like
that
of
cannibals
rushing
to
a
feast
of
blood
as
at
beaumont
though
the
hall
was
full
of
rabid
the
frightful
silence
continued
such
was
the
horror
which
froze
one
and
all
to
their
very
bones
only
a
long
shudder
a
stifled
groan
sped
through
the
throng
and
they
went
out
without
a
word
without
a
push
in
a
dark
stream
like
some
funeral
assembly
choking
with
emotion
stricken
with
fear
and
outside
marc
found
david
sobbing
so
the
church
was
victorious
the
brothers
school
would
revive
to
life
while
the
secular
school
would
again
become
the
of
hell
the
satanic
den
where
children
were
corrupted
both
in
mind
and
body
the
desperate
and
gigantic
effort
made
by
the
congregations
and
by
almost
all
the
clergy
had
again
retarded
their
defeat
which
was
certain
in
the
future
for
years
however
one
would
again
see
the
young
generations
stupefied
by
error
rotted
by
lies
the
forward
march
of
mankind
would
be
hampered
afresh
until
the
day
when
free
thought
invincible
and
still
pursuing
its
course
in
spite
of
everything
should
at
last
deliver
the
people
by
science
which
alone
could
render
it
capable
of
truth
and
equity
on
the
following
evening
when
marc
returned
to
maillebois
exhausted
by
fatigue
and
quite
he
found
a
letter
of
three
lines
awaiting
him
have
read
the
whole
of
the
inquiry
i
have
followed
the
trial
the
most
monstrous
of
crimes
has
been
committed
simon
is
iv
on
the
morrow
a
thursday
marc
who
had
scarcely
slept
that
night
had
just
risen
when
he
received
an
early
visit
from
his
daughter
louise
she
having
heard
of
his
return
had
escaped
for
a
moment
from
her
grandmother
house
and
throwing
her
arms
wildly
about
her
neck
she
exclaimed
father
father
what
a
deal
of
sorrow
you
must
have
had
and
how
pleased
i
am
to
be
able
to
kiss
you
a
big
girl
nowadays
louise
was
fully
acquainted
with
the
simon
affair
and
shared
all
the
faith
all
the
passion
for
justice
displayed
by
that
father
the
master
whose
lofty
mind
was
her
guide
thus
her
cry
was
instinct
with
the
revolt
and
despair
into
which
she
had
been
cast
by
the
monstrous
proceedings
at
rozan
but
on
thus
seeing
her
before
him
and
feeling
her
embrace
marc
thought
of
geneviève
letter
to
which
his
sleeplessness
that
night
had
been
largely
due
your
mother
he
asked
you
know
that
she
has
written
to
me
and
that
she
is
now
on
our
side
yes
father
i
know
it
she
spoke
of
it
to
me
ah
if
i
were
to
tell
you
of
all
the
quarrels
there
were
when
grandmother
saw
mamma
beginning
to
read
everything
procuring
documents
which
had
never
been
in
the
house
before
and
going
out
every
morning
to
buy
the
full
report
of
the
new
trial
grandmother
wanted
to
burn
everything
so
mamma
shut
herself
up
in
her
own
room
and
spent
all
her
time
there
and
i
also
read
everything
mamma
allowed
me
to
do
so
oh
papa
what
a
dreadful
affair
that
poor
man
that
poor
innocent
overwhelmed
by
so
many
cruel
people
if
i
could
i
should
love
you
all
the
more
for
having
loved
and
defended
him
she
again
threw
her
arms
about
her
father
neck
and
kissed
him
with
heartfelt
fervour
and
he
in
spite
of
his
sufferings
began
to
smile
as
if
some
delicious
balm
had
somewhat
calmed
the
smarting
of
his
wounds
and
while
he
smiled
he
pictured
his
wife
and
his
daughter
reading
together
learning
the
truth
and
at
last
returning
to
him
letter
her
dear
letter
he
said
in
an
undertone
consolation
and
hope
it
gave
me
will
not
joy
return
after
so
many
misfortunes
then
he
anxiously
questioned
louise
your
mother
spoke
to
you
of
me
does
she
understand
does
she
regret
our
torments
i
always
felt
that
she
would
come
back
to
me
when
she
knew
the
truth
but
the
girl
prettily
raised
a
finger
to
her
lips
she
in
her
turn
was
smiling
papa
she
said
try
to
make
me
say
what
i
ca
say
yet
i
should
be
telling
a
falsehood
if
i
spoke
positively
our
affairs
are
in
a
good
way
that
is
all
remain
patient
a
little
longer
remain
confident
in
your
daughter
who
tries
to
be
as
reasonable
and
affectionate
as
you
are
then
she
gave
him
some
bad
news
about
madame
berthereau
for
several
years
the
latter
had
been
suffering
from
a
heart
complaint
which
recent
events
seemed
to
have
suddenly
aggravated
madame
fits
of
anger
the
outbursts
with
which
she
made
the
dark
dismal
little
house
shake
at
all
hours
of
the
day
proved
very
prejudicial
to
the
sick
woman
for
they
brought
on
shuddering
and
stifling
fits
which
she
could
hardly
overcome
at
present
in
order
to
escape
those
nervous
frights
she
no
longer
went
down
into
the
little
but
remained
on
a
couch
in
her
gazing
from
morn
till
night
at
the
deserted
place
des
capucins
with
those
poor
melancholy
eyes
of
hers
in
which
one
read
such
keen
regret
for
the
joys
she
had
lost
so
long
ago
we
do
amuse
ourselves
at
all
now
louise
continued
remains
in
her
room
grandmamma
berthereau
in
hers
and
grandmamma
duparque
goes
up
and
down
bangs
the
doors
and
quarrels
with
pélagie
when
she
finds
nobody
to
scold
but
i
do
complain
for
i
shut
myself
up
as
well
and
work
mamma
has
agreed
to
it
you
know
i
shall
go
up
for
admission
to
the
training
school
in
six
months
time
and
i
hope
to
get
in
just
at
that
moment
sébastien
milhomme
who
was
free
that
day
arrived
from
beaumont
all
anxiety
to
embrace
his
former
master
of
whose
return
he
had
heard
and
almost
immediately
afterwards
came
joseph
and
sarah
who
on
behalf
of
their
mother
and
the
lehmanns
whom
the
reconviction
of
simon
had
overwhelmed
wished
to
thank
marc
for
his
heroic
if
vain
efforts
the
brother
and
sister
related
what
a
thunderbolt
had
fallen
on
the
wretched
shop
in
the
rue
du
trou
on
the
previous
evening
when
david
had
telegraphed
the
frightful
tidings
madame
simon
had
preferred
to
await
them
there
with
her
parents
and
her
children
such
great
hostility
had
she
encountered
in
that
clerical
town
of
rozan
where
moreover
her
modest
means
did
not
allow
her
to
live
and
the
mournful
house
was
again
in
tears
acquainted
only
with
the
iniquitous
verdict
and
ignorant
of
what
might
now
happen
all
decision
as
to
the
future
being
postponed
until
the
return
of
david
who
for
the
time
had
remained
near
his
brother
the
eyes
of
joseph
and
sarah
were
still
red
and
swollen
for
they
had
spent
a
tearful
feverish
night
without
a
moment
quiet
rest
and
as
while
speaking
of
their
father
they
again
began
to
sob
sébastien
carried
away
by
his
feelings
kissed
his
good
friend
sarah
while
louise
taking
hold
of
joseph
hands
and
likewise
shedding
tears
naïvely
sought
to
console
him
somewhat
by
speaking
of
her
great
affection
for
him
she
was
seventeen
and
he
twenty
sébastien
was
a
year
or
two
older
and
sarah
was
eighteen
marc
felt
moved
as
he
saw
those
young
folk
there
before
him
quivering
with
youth
intelligence
and
kindliness
and
a
thought
which
had
occurred
to
him
and
brought
him
a
delightful
hope
already
in
the
days
when
he
had
seen
them
playing
as
children
now
returned
might
they
not
indeed
be
predestined
consorts
such
as
would
produce
the
happy
harvest
of
the
future
who
would
bring
broader
hearts
and
more
liberal
minds
to
the
great
work
of
but
although
his
daughter
visit
gave
marc
no
little
comfort
for
the
time
he
became
very
downcast
on
the
ensuing
days
so
distressful
was
the
spectacle
which
his
poor
poisoned
and
dishonoured
country
now
presented
the
crime
of
crimes
had
been
committed
and
france
did
not
rise
against
it
during
the
long
struggle
for
revision
marc
had
already
failed
to
recognise
in
her
the
generous
magnanimous
liberating
and
country
to
which
he
had
dedicated
such
lofty
and
passionate
love
but
never
had
he
thought
it
possible
that
she
would
sink
to
that
base
level
and
become
a
deaf
harsh
sleepy
and
cowardly
france
making
her
bed
in
shame
and
iniquity
how
many
years
and
generations
would
be
needed
to
arouse
her
from
that
abominable
somnolence
for
a
moment
marc
despaired
he
deemed
his
country
lost
it
was
as
if
he
could
hear
férou
maledictions
arising
from
the
grave
doomed
completely
rotted
by
the
priests
poisoned
by
a
filthy
press
sunk
in
such
a
morass
of
ignorance
and
credulity
that
never
would
one
be
able
to
extricate
her
on
the
morrow
of
the
monstrous
verdict
of
rozan
he
had
still
imagined
an
awakening
to
be
possible
he
had
awaited
a
rising
of
upright
consciences
and
healthy
minds
but
none
had
stirred
the
bravest
seemed
to
hide
themselves
away
in
their
corners
and
the
supreme
ignominy
took
its
course
thanks
to
the
universal
imbecility
and
cowardice
as
he
went
about
maillebois
marc
caught
sight
of
darras
who
now
pulled
a
very
long
face
though
he
was
simply
in
despair
at
the
mayoralty
again
escaping
him
owing
to
the
triumph
of
the
clerical
party
then
on
meeting
fernand
bongard
the
doloirs
and
the
savins
his
former
pupils
marc
felt
greatly
distressed
for
he
now
realised
decisively
that
he
had
been
able
to
impart
to
them
little
if
any
social
equity
and
civic
courage
fernand
shrugged
his
shoulders
bent
on
knowing
nothing
the
doloirs
had
again
begun
to
doubt
innocence
while
as
for
the
twin
savins
if
they
remained
convinced
of
it
they
argued
that
they
could
not
effect
a
revolution
by
themselves
and
that
after
all
one
jew
more
or
less
was
a
matter
of
no
importance
terror
reigned
people
hurried
home
resolved
to
compromise
themselves
no
further
things
were
even
worse
at
beaumont
whither
marc
repaired
to
see
if
he
could
not
arouse
some
influential
people
and
persuade
them
to
attempt
a
last
effort
to
have
the
infamous
verdict
set
aside
lemarrois
to
whom
he
thus
ventured
to
apply
seemed
to
take
him
for
a
madman
and
discarding
his
usual
courteous
kindliness
he
plainly
almost
roughly
told
him
that
the
affair
was
ended
and
that
any
attempt
to
revise
it
would
be
insane
for
the
country
was
utterly
sick
and
weary
of
the
whole
business
it
had
become
most
hurtful
as
a
basis
for
political
action
and
if
the
clerical
reactionaries
were
allowed
an
opportunity
to
exploit
it
any
further
the
republic
would
certainly
be
undone
at
the
approaching
elections
the
elections
indeed
that
was
again
the
great
argument
the
only
policy
was
to
bury
the
supreme
iniquity
in
even
deeper
silence
than
after
the
first
trial
there
was
no
need
of
any
understanding
to
that
effect
the
deputies
the
senators
the
prefect
the
officials
all
sank
instinctively
into
perfect
silence
in
the
dread
they
felt
at
the
thought
of
the
twice
condemned
but
innocent
man
and
once
again
former
republicans
and
voltaireans
like
lemarrois
drew
yet
nearer
to
the
church
whose
help
they
thought
they
might
require
to
resist
the
rising
tide
of
socialism
lemarrois
personally
had
been
pleased
to
see
his
adversary
delbos
defeated
at
rozan
and
in
resorting
to
a
cowardly
policy
of
silence
he
was
largely
influenced
by
a
desire
to
let
simon
compromised
champions
drown
themselves
amid
that
general
only
marcilly
retained
his
amiable
smile
he
had
already
held
the
portfolio
of
public
instruction
in
a
radical
ministry
and
felt
certain
of
securing
it
again
some
day
in
a
moderate
one
and
so
convinced
was
he
now
of
the
irresistible
power
of
his
suppleness
and
his
that
alone
amongst
those
to
whom
marc
applied
he
gave
him
a
cordial
greeting
and
without
making
any
express
promise
allowed
him
to
hope
for
everything
should
he
marcilly
return
to
power
for
the
moment
the
congregations
became
triumphant
what
a
relief
it
was
to
think
that
father
crabot
his
accomplices
and
his
creatures
were
saved
judge
gragnon
gave
a
grand
dinner
followed
by
a
reception
to
which
flocked
all
the
members
of
the
judicial
world
with
many
functionaries
and
even
university
men
they
smiled
and
shook
hands
well
pleased
at
finding
themselves
alive
after
incurring
such
serious
danger
every
morning
petit
celebrated
the
victory
of
the
valiant
soldiers
of
god
and
the
country
then
all
at
once
it
became
silent
in
compliance
no
doubt
with
some
hint
received
from
exalted
spheres
the
fact
was
that
amid
all
the
stir
of
victory
everybody
began
to
detect
moral
defeat
fear
of
the
morrow
revived
and
it
was
deemed
prudent
to
divert
people
minds
moreover
the
rozan
jurors
had
now
made
revelations
it
was
known
that
they
had
convicted
simon
merely
by
a
majority
of
seven
to
five
and
that
on
quitting
the
court
they
had
unanimously
signed
a
recommendation
for
pardon
they
could
not
have
confessed
more
plainly
the
mortal
embarrassment
in
which
they
had
been
placed
the
cruel
necessity
of
confirming
the
former
verdict
of
beaumont
even
though
they
retained
little
doubt
of
the
prisoner
innocence
and
the
extraordinary
course
taken
by
that
jury
which
in
the
most
contradictory
way
at
one
moment
condemned
simon
and
at
another
absolved
him
tended
to
make
his
innocence
manifest
to
everybody
a
pardon
was
felt
to
be
so
necessary
and
so
inevitable
that
nobody
was
surprised
when
one
was
signed
a
few
days
later
petit
thought
fit
to
insult
the
dirty
jew
a
last
time
but
even
the
managers
of
that
unprincipled
rag
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
glad
to
be
at
last
delivered
from
the
abominable
part
they
had
played
for
so
many
years
david
was
beset
by
a
final
anguish
a
frightful
struggle
of
conscience
in
connection
with
that
pardon
his
brother
strength
was
quite
spent
fever
consumed
him
he
was
so
exhausted
both
physically
and
morally
that
doubtless
he
would
merely
return
to
prison
to
die
there
and
on
the
other
hand
a
weeping
wife
and
children
awaited
him
still
hoping
that
they
might
save
him
by
dint
of
care
and
love
nevertheless
david
at
first
rejected
the
idea
of
a
pardon
and
before
everything
else
wished
to
consult
marc
delbos
and
the
other
valiant
defenders
of
the
innocent
prisoner
for
he
well
understood
that
even
if
the
pardon
would
not
deprive
simon
of
the
right
of
some
day
establishing
his
innocence
it
would
rob
the
others
of
their
most
powerful
means
of
prosecuting
that
cause
of
justice
to
which
they
had
given
their
lives
but
however
grieved
they
might
be
all
bowed
to
the
suggestion
of
a
pardon
and
david
then
accepted
it
at
the
same
time
it
was
felt
by
marc
and
delbos
that
the
congregations
had
good
reason
to
be
triumphant
for
humanly
the
simon
affair
was
ended
by
that
pardon
in
consequence
of
which
it
would
no
longer
stir
the
multitude
to
a
sense
of
equity
and
generosity
the
question
of
simon
future
was
speedily
settled
it
was
impossible
to
take
him
back
to
maillebois
where
madame
simon
had
decided
to
remain
a
little
longer
with
her
children
joseph
and
sarah
who
were
awaiting
the
reopening
of
the
neighbouring
training
schools
david
once
more
took
everything
on
himself
he
had
long
previously
formed
his
plans
which
were
to
dispose
of
his
sand
and
gravel
pits
and
acquire
a
marble
quarry
in
a
lonely
valley
of
the
pyrenees
an
excellent
affair
which
a
friend
had
recommended
to
him
and
which
he
had
carefully
studied
he
meant
to
remove
simon
thither
taking
him
as
a
partner
and
assuredly
the
mountain
air
and
the
delight
of
active
life
would
restore
his
health
within
six
months
time
as
soon
as
the
installation
should
be
effected
madame
simon
might
rejoin
her
husband
and
even
the
children
might
end
the
vacation
in
their
father
company
all
this
was
carried
into
effect
with
remarkable
precision
and
despatch
simon
was
conjured
away
from
rozan
which
was
still
in
an
agitated
state
and
for
a
time
nobody
even
suspected
that
he
had
been
removed
he
travelled
unrecognised
vanishing
with
david
into
that
lonely
valley
embosomed
amid
lofty
peaks
it
only
became
known
by
a
newspaper
article
that
his
family
had
joined
him
from
that
moment
he
altogether
disappeared
and
people
even
began
to
forget
his
existence
on
the
very
day
when
the
simon
family
found
itself
reunited
in
that
pyrenean
solitude
marc
repaired
to
the
training
college
of
beaumont
whither
an
urgent
letter
from
salvan
had
summoned
him
and
as
soon
as
they
had
shaken
hands
they
began
to
talk
of
the
simons
evoking
the
sweet
and
touching
scene
which
was
being
enacted
far
away
indeed
at
the
other
end
of
france
must
all
take
it
as
our
reward
said
salvan
we
have
not
yet
managed
to
make
the
affair
yield
the
great
social
lesson
and
the
penalties
that
attach
to
it
we
have
at
least
brought
this
happiness
to
pass
we
have
restored
the
poor
martyr
to
his
wife
and
his
children
said
marc
have
been
thinking
of
it
ever
since
this
morning
i
can
picture
them
all
together
smiling
in
peace
under
the
broad
blue
sky
and
for
that
poor
man
so
long
fastened
to
his
chain
what
a
delight
it
must
be
to
be
able
to
walk
about
freely
inhaling
the
freshness
of
the
mountain
springs
the
pure
odours
of
the
plants
and
trees
the
dear
children
too
and
the
dear
wife
how
happy
they
must
feel
to
see
their
dream
realised
to
have
him
beside
them
again
to
take
him
about
like
a
big
child
just
recovering
from
a
severe
illness
and
watch
him
reviving
to
health
and
strength
you
are
right
it
is
our
reward
the
only
one
he
paused
then
added
in
a
lower
voice
with
some
of
the
bitterness
of
a
combatant
who
laments
that
his
weapon
should
have
been
broken
in
his
hand
is
quite
over
a
pardon
was
inevitable
no
doubt
but
it
has
deprived
us
of
all
power
of
action
we
can
only
wait
for
the
crop
of
good
grain
we
have
sown
that
is
if
ever
it
will
sprout
up
in
the
hard
ground
where
we
have
scattered
it
it
will
rise
never
fear
my
friend
salvan
exclaimed
must
never
despair
of
our
poor
great
country
it
may
be
deceived
it
may
deceive
itself
but
it
always
returns
to
truth
and
reason
let
us
rest
satisfied
with
our
work
it
will
bear
fruit
in
the
future
then
after
a
pause
he
continued
in
a
thoughtful
way
i
agree
with
you
that
our
victory
will
not
be
immediate
the
times
are
really
execrable
never
have
we
passed
through
a
more
troublous
and
threatening
period
and
indeed
if
i
asked
you
to
call
it
was
in
order
to
talk
to
you
of
the
present
disquieting
situation
then
he
acquainted
marc
with
what
he
had
learnt
since
the
trial
at
rozan
all
the
recognised
simonists
all
the
brave
men
who
had
become
compromised
in
the
affair
had
found
themselves
exposed
to
the
vengeance
of
the
congregations
the
hatred
of
the
egotistical
and
cowardly
multitude
undoubtedly
they
would
be
made
to
pay
heavily
in
their
interests
and
their
persons
for
the
crime
they
had
committed
by
supporting
the
cause
of
truth
and
justice
you
heard
that
nobody
now
bows
to
delbos
at
the
palace
of
justice
said
salvan
the
cases
confided
to
him
have
been
withdrawn
clients
regard
him
as
being
altogether
too
compromising
he
has
to
begin
his
career
afresh
and
at
the
next
elections
he
will
certainly
be
defeated
again
for
the
affair
has
led
to
disruption
even
in
the
socialist
ranks
for
my
own
part
i
shall
probably
be
dismissed
you
interrupted
marc
in
accents
of
surprise
and
grief
yes
my
friend
you
are
not
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
mauraisin
has
long
coveted
my
post
he
never
manœuvred
otherwise
than
in
order
to
dislodge
me
his
prolonged
flirtation
with
the
church
party
has
been
simply
a
matter
of
tactics
in
order
to
secure
its
support
in
the
hour
of
victory
after
the
inquiry
of
the
court
of
cassation
he
certainly
felt
frightened
and
began
to
say
that
he
had
always
regarded
simon
as
innocent
but
since
simon
was
reconvicted
mauraisin
has
again
been
barking
with
the
clerical
pack
feeling
convinced
that
le
barazer
will
be
compelled
to
dismiss
me
by
the
pressure
brought
to
bear
on
him
by
all
the
victorious
reactionary
forces
it
will
astonish
me
very
much
if
i
am
still
here
when
the
new
term
begins
in
october
marc
again
began
to
express
his
grief
and
moreover
he
refused
to
believe
salvan
he
recalled
all
the
services
which
the
latter
had
rendered
and
set
forth
the
necessity
of
persevering
with
the
great
work
of
saving
france
from
falsehood
and
credulity
can
not
leave
before
your
task
is
accomplished
he
added
remains
so
much
for
you
to
do
although
le
barazer
has
never
spoken
out
plainly
he
has
been
at
heart
on
our
side
and
i
am
sure
that
he
will
never
be
guilty
of
such
a
bad
action
as
to
dismiss
you
salvan
smiled
somewhat
sadly
the
first
place
he
answered
is
indispensable
i
may
disappear
but
others
will
rise
to
continue
the
good
work
we
have
begun
mauraisin
may
take
my
place
but
i
am
convinced
that
he
will
do
no
great
harm
for
he
will
not
retain
it
long
and
he
will
be
forced
to
follow
in
my
footsteps
some
work
you
see
when
once
it
has
been
begun
is
accomplished
by
the
very
force
of
human
evolution
and
remains
independent
of
any
particular
individual
men
but
one
might
think
by
the
way
you
talk
that
you
did
not
know
le
barazer
we
are
personally
of
little
account
in
his
intricate
republican
diplomacy
he
was
on
our
side
that
is
certain
he
would
be
with
us
still
if
we
had
won
the
battle
but
our
defeat
has
placed
him
into
the
greatest
possible
embarrassment
he
really
has
but
one
desire
to
save
his
work
the
system
of
secular
and
compulsory
education
of
which
he
was
one
of
the
creators
thus
as
the
church
has
regained
power
for
the
moment
and
threatens
his
work
he
will
resign
himself
to
necessary
sacrifices
and
temporise
until
he
is
able
to
speak
as
a
master
in
his
turn
such
is
his
nature
and
we
can
not
alter
him
salvan
continued
in
this
strain
enumerating
all
the
influences
which
were
being
brought
to
bear
on
le
barazer
rector
forbes
who
was
so
desirous
of
quietude
and
who
so
greatly
feared
worries
with
the
minister
had
plainly
told
him
that
he
must
satisfy
the
demands
of
the
opposition
deputies
these
at
the
head
of
whom
count
hector
de
sanglebœuf
distinguished
himself
by
his
violence
were
making
every
effort
to
secure
the
dismissal
of
all
the
notorious
simonists
belonging
to
the
civil
and
the
educational
services
and
none
of
the
republican
deputies
not
even
the
radical
lemarrois
moved
indeed
they
consented
to
that
hecatomb
in
order
to
pacify
public
opinion
anxious
as
they
were
to
lose
as
few
electors
as
possible
at
present
also
professors
and
masters
followed
the
example
of
principal
depinvilliers
attending
mass
with
their
wives
and
daughters
every
sunday
then
at
the
lycée
of
beaumont
the
chaplain
reigned
supreme
religious
exercises
were
becoming
compulsory
all
pupils
who
refused
attendance
were
badly
noted
harassed
and
until
no
resource
was
left
them
but
to
comply
or
quit
father
crabot
made
his
hand
felt
at
that
lycée
with
the
same
reactionary
authority
that
he
displayed
in
the
management
of
the
college
of
valmarie
and
the
increasing
audacity
of
the
congregations
was
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
the
jesuit
professors
of
valmarie
now
openly
acknowledged
their
standing
whereas
previously
in
order
to
defeat
the
laws
they
had
outwardly
passed
themselves
off
as
secular
priests
is
how
we
stand
salvan
concluded
to
the
reconviction
of
simon
they
speak
as
masters
and
wring
whatever
they
please
from
the
universal
cowardice
and
imbecility
it
is
already
said
that
mademoiselle
rouzaire
is
to
be
appointed
of
the
chief
girls
school
in
beaumont
jauffre
now
at
jonville
is
also
to
be
appointed
here
it
seems
for
he
has
threatened
to
turn
against
abbé
cognasse
if
there
should
be
any
further
delay
in
rewarding
his
services
finally
doutrequin
once
a
republican
who
has
rallied
to
the
church
from
a
deplorable
aberration
of
patriotism
has
secured
two
suburban
schools
for
his
sons
who
have
made
nationalism
and
their
chief
dogmas
so
that
we
are
now
once
more
in
a
period
of
acute
reaction
the
last
we
shall
witness
i
hope
pending
the
day
when
the
country
will
spit
out
the
poison
which
is
killing
it
and
if
i
am
dismissed
my
friend
you
suspect
it
do
you
not
you
will
be
dismissed
also
marc
smiled
he
now
understood
why
salvan
had
sent
for
him
in
all
haste
i
am
condemned
he
said
i
am
afraid
so
and
i
wished
to
warn
you
of
it
immediately
oh
the
thing
is
not
settled
yet
le
barazer
remains
silent
biding
his
time
as
it
were
and
saying
nothing
of
his
intentions
but
you
can
have
no
idea
of
the
assaults
he
has
to
withstand
particularly
with
respect
to
yourself
naturally
enough
it
is
your
dismissal
that
is
most
urgently
demanded
i
was
talking
to
you
just
now
of
that
big
simpleton
sanglebœuf
that
puppet
whose
strings
are
pulled
by
the
old
marchioness
de
boise
whom
he
drives
to
despair
i
hear
so
clumsily
does
he
execute
the
movements
which
she
directs
well
three
times
already
sanglebœuf
has
bounced
up
to
the
préfecture
to
threaten
le
barazer
with
an
interpellation
in
the
chamber
of
deputies
if
he
does
not
come
to
an
understanding
with
prefect
hennebise
to
annihilate
you
you
would
be
already
dead
i
think
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
arrogance
of
that
ultimatum
but
it
is
possible
for
le
barazer
to
resist
much
longer
my
poor
friend
and
you
must
bear
him
any
malice
remember
all
the
quiet
obstinacy
and
diplomatic
skill
with
which
for
many
years
he
supported
you
he
always
found
some
means
of
saving
you
by
granting
compensations
to
your
adversaries
but
now
it
is
all
over
i
have
not
even
spoken
to
him
about
you
all
efforts
on
your
behalf
would
be
useless
you
must
let
him
act
as
he
pleases
doubtless
he
is
only
delaying
his
decision
in
order
to
devise
something
ingenious
for
he
himself
does
not
like
to
be
defeated
and
he
will
never
relinquish
his
efforts
on
behalf
of
his
work
that
system
of
secular
and
compulsory
education
which
alone
can
give
us
a
new
france
marc
smiled
no
longer
indeed
he
had
become
very
sad
will
be
a
great
blow
he
answered
shall
leave
the
best
of
myself
behind
me
in
that
school
of
maillebois
among
those
dear
lads
whom
i
regard
almost
as
my
own
children
besides
what
shall
i
do
if
my
career
is
thus
brought
to
an
end
i
am
not
competent
to
take
up
any
other
useful
work
and
how
painful
it
will
be
to
see
the
work
i
have
been
doing
interrupted
left
unfinished
at
the
very
moment
when
more
than
ever
truth
has
need
of
sturdy
workers
but
salvan
in
his
turn
bravely
smiled
and
taking
hold
of
hands
said
to
him
do
lose
your
courage
we
shall
surely
find
something
to
do
we
remain
with
our
arms
crossed
then
marc
feeling
comforted
replied
are
right
when
a
man
like
you
is
struck
one
can
follow
him
into
disgrace
without
thought
of
shame
the
future
at
all
events
belongs
to
us
a
few
more
days
went
by
at
maillebois
the
victorious
congregations
were
endeavouring
to
turn
the
situation
to
pecuniary
account
great
efforts
were
made
to
restore
the
former
prosperity
of
the
school
several
families
were
won
over
and
it
seemed
likely
that
at
the
new
term
the
school
would
gain
a
dozen
fresh
pupils
meantime
the
capuchins
showed
extraordinary
audacity
was
it
not
after
all
the
glorious
antony
of
padua
who
had
managed
everything
obtained
everything
from
the
benevolence
of
heaven
indeed
it
could
not
be
denied
it
was
to
him
that
one
owed
the
reconviction
of
simon
thanks
to
the
franc
and
pieces
which
so
many
pious
souls
had
dropped
into
the
saint
while
asking
him
to
bring
about
the
annihilation
of
the
jew
thus
a
fresh
miracle
had
been
performed
never
before
had
the
saint
power
been
manifested
in
so
lofty
a
manner
and
as
a
natural
result
offerings
poured
in
from
all
sides
moreover
father
théodose
encouraged
inspired
by
this
success
conceived
a
masterly
plan
to
reap
another
large
harvest
of
money
by
the
saint
aid
he
launched
an
extraordinary
financial
affair
with
mortgage
bonds
on
paradise
each
bond
being
of
five
francs
value
the
district
was
flooded
with
circulars
and
prospectuses
explaining
the
ingenious
working
of
these
investments
in
celestial
felicity
each
bond
comprised
ten
coupons
of
half
a
franc
representing
good
works
prayers
and
masses
payable
as
interest
here
below
and
redeemable
in
heaven
at
the
cashier
office
of
the
antony
premiums
were
also
offered
in
order
to
attract
subscribers
twenty
bonds
gave
one
a
right
to
a
coloured
statuette
of
the
saint
and
a
hundred
ensured
one
an
annual
mass
finally
the
prospectus
explained
that
the
name
of
antony
bonds
was
given
to
this
scrip
because
it
was
the
saint
who
would
redeem
it
a
hundredfold
in
the
next
world
and
the
announcement
ended
with
these
words
supernatural
guarantees
make
these
bonds
absolutely
safe
no
financial
catastrophe
can
threaten
them
even
the
destruction
of
the
world
at
the
end
of
time
would
leave
them
in
force
or
rather
would
at
once
place
the
holders
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
full
capitalised
interest
footnote
as
some
readers
might
think
this
an
invention
on
part
it
is
as
well
to
mention
that
the
prospectus
referred
to
was
actually
issued
by
a
french
religious
the
success
was
enormous
in
a
few
weeks
time
thousands
of
bonds
had
been
sold
those
devotees
who
were
too
poor
to
buy
a
whole
one
clubbed
together
and
then
divided
the
coupons
credulous
and
suffering
souls
eagerly
risked
their
money
in
this
new
lottery
whose
great
prize
was
to
be
the
realisation
of
a
fondly
eternity
of
happy
life
it
was
certainly
rumoured
that
monseigneur
bergerot
intended
to
prohibit
this
impudent
speculation
which
scandalised
the
more
reasonable
catholics
but
in
the
unpleasant
position
in
which
the
prelate
had
been
placed
by
the
defeat
of
the
simonists
whom
he
was
accused
of
having
stealthily
supported
he
was
doubtless
afraid
to
do
so
though
it
greatly
distressed
him
to
abandon
the
church
to
the
rising
tide
of
superstition
he
had
found
that
he
could
place
little
reliance
on
his
clergy
and
thus
he
had
never
had
the
courage
to
resist
the
congregations
aged
as
he
now
was
he
had
become
weaker
still
only
retaining
enough
strength
to
kneel
and
beg
forgiveness
for
thus
suffering
the
merchants
to
invade
the
temple
but
abbé
quandieu
the
priest
of
martin
could
not
bear
that
desecration
any
longer
all
his
christian
resignation
forsook
him
when
the
bonds
of
antony
made
their
appearance
such
trafficking
was
too
outrageous
and
he
gave
expression
in
the
pulpit
to
his
revolt
as
a
minister
of
christ
his
grief
at
beholding
the
base
downfall
of
that
great
christianity
which
had
renewed
the
world
and
which
so
many
illustrious
minds
had
raised
to
the
purest
summits
of
ideality
then
he
paid
a
last
visit
to
his
bishop
and
friend
monseigneur
bergerot
and
finding
him
unable
to
continue
the
struggle
feeling
too
that
he
himself
was
vanquished
and
paralysed
he
resigned
his
cure
and
withdrew
to
a
little
house
in
the
outskirts
of
maillebois
intending
to
dwell
there
on
a
scanty
income
outside
that
church
whose
policy
of
hatred
and
whose
basely
superstitious
worship
he
could
no
longer
serve
the
capuchins
deemed
the
opportunity
favourable
for
a
fresh
triumph
in
celebration
of
what
father
théodose
styled
the
flight
of
their
former
adversary
by
careful
manœuvring
the
bishop
had
been
induced
to
appoint
a
young
curate
of
the
school
a
creature
of
father
crabot
to
the
parish
of
maillebois
and
the
idea
was
to
bear
a
superb
statue
of
antony
all
red
and
gold
in
solemn
procession
from
the
capuchin
chapel
to
martin
where
it
would
be
set
up
in
great
pomp
this
would
be
the
crowning
consecration
of
the
victory
which
had
been
achieved
the
conquest
of
the
parish
by
the
congregation
the
monks
becoming
its
sovereign
masters
able
to
disseminate
on
every
side
the
idolatrous
worship
by
which
they
hoped
to
bleed
and
abase
the
community
and
turn
it
into
the
ignorant
flock
of
the
days
of
servitude
the
procession
which
took
place
one
warm
day
in
september
with
the
of
all
the
clergy
of
the
district
proved
magnificent
and
was
attended
by
a
great
concourse
of
people
who
repaired
to
maillebois
from
all
points
of
the
department
only
the
place
des
capucins
and
a
short
lane
really
separated
the
chapel
from
the
church
but
a
roundabout
line
of
route
was
selected
they
crossed
the
place
de
la
république
and
marched
along
the
whole
high
street
in
this
wise
promenading
antony
from
one
to
the
other
end
of
the
town
mayor
philis
surrounded
by
the
clerical
majority
of
the
municipal
council
followed
the
painted
statue
which
was
borne
on
a
platform
draped
with
red
velvet
although
it
was
holiday
time
the
whole
of
the
brothers
school
had
been
mobilised
boys
had
been
specially
recruited
dressed
and
provided
with
candles
behind
them
came
the
daughters
of
mary
and
numerous
pious
brotherhoods
sisterhoods
and
other
associations
an
interminable
string
of
devotees
to
say
nothing
of
all
the
nuns
brought
expressly
from
the
beaumont
convents
only
monseigneur
bergerot
was
wanting
as
it
happened
he
had
sent
a
letter
of
regret
having
fallen
ill
two
days
previously
never
before
had
maillebois
been
possessed
by
such
religious
fever
people
knelt
on
the
foot
pavements
men
shed
tears
three
girls
fell
to
the
ground
in
hysterical
fits
and
had
to
be
carried
to
a
shop
in
the
evening
the
benediction
at
martin
amid
the
pealing
of
the
bells
was
quite
dazzling
and
not
a
doubt
remained
surely
the
town
was
now
redeemed
and
forgiven
by
that
grandiose
ceremony
providence
signified
its
willingness
to
wipe
out
for
ever
the
vile
memory
of
simon
the
jew
it
so
happened
that
salvan
came
to
maillebois
that
day
in
order
to
see
madame
berthereau
respecting
whom
he
had
received
some
extremely
disquieting
news
and
he
had
just
quitted
the
little
house
in
the
place
des
capucins
when
he
caught
sight
of
marc
who
on
his
way
home
after
a
visit
to
the
lehmanns
had
found
his
progress
barred
by
the
interminable
procession
they
shook
hands
in
silence
then
for
some
time
were
compelled
to
remain
waiting
when
the
last
of
the
monks
had
gone
by
behind
the
idol
all
ablaze
with
gilding
and
red
paint
they
just
exchanged
a
glance
and
took
a
few
steps
in
silence
was
going
to
call
on
you
said
salvan
at
last
marc
fancied
that
he
had
brought
him
news
of
his
dismissal
it
signed
then
he
inquired
i
to
pack
my
trunks
no
my
friend
le
barazer
has
given
no
signs
of
life
as
yet
he
is
preparing
something
but
our
dismissal
is
certain
you
must
take
a
little
patience
then
ceasing
to
jest
he
added
with
an
expression
of
grief
fact
is
i
heard
that
madame
berthereau
was
at
the
last
stage
and
i
desired
to
see
her
i
have
just
left
her
and
her
end
is
certainly
very
near
came
to
warn
me
of
it
yesterday
evening
marc
replied
should
have
liked
to
call
at
once
as
you
have
done
but
madame
duparque
has
signified
that
she
will
immediately
quit
the
house
if
i
should
dare
to
set
foot
in
it
on
any
pretext
and
though
madame
berthereau
as
i
know
would
like
to
see
me
she
is
afraid
to
give
expression
to
her
desire
for
fear
of
some
scandal
beside
her
ah
my
friend
one
can
never
overcome
the
hatred
of
a
bigot
they
walked
on
again
preserving
silence
at
last
salvan
resumed
madame
duparque
keeps
good
guard
and
for
a
moment
i
thought
that
she
would
not
let
me
go
upstairs
at
all
events
she
did
not
quit
me
she
kept
a
watch
on
everything
i
said
either
to
the
patient
or
your
wife
she
is
certainly
afraid
that
something
may
result
from
the
blow
which
is
about
to
fall
on
the
house
yes
madame
berthereau
her
daughter
is
about
to
escape
from
her
by
death
and
she
fears
perhaps
that
geneviève
her
granddaughter
may
also
free
herself
marc
halted
and
giving
his
friend
a
keen
glance
inquired
you
notice
any
sign
of
that
yes
but
i
did
not
wish
to
mention
it
to
you
for
it
would
distress
me
to
give
you
any
false
hope
but
it
was
in
connection
with
that
procession
that
barefaced
idolatry
which
we
witnessed
just
now
it
appears
that
your
wife
absolutely
refused
to
attend
it
and
that
is
why
i
found
madame
duparque
at
home
she
of
course
was
very
desirous
of
displaying
her
piety
in
the
front
rank
of
all
the
devotees
but
she
feared
that
if
she
should
absent
herself
for
a
single
moment
you
or
some
other
might
get
into
the
house
and
rob
her
of
her
daughter
and
granddaughter
so
she
remained
at
home
and
you
can
imagine
with
what
cold
fury
she
received
me
trying
to
transpierce
me
with
those
eyes
of
hers
which
are
like
rapiers
marc
was
becoming
excited
so
geneviève
refused
to
attend
that
procession
she
understood
its
hurtfulness
its
baseness
and
folly
then
and
she
is
returning
in
some
degree
to
the
healthy
she
used
to
show
doubt
salvan
answered
believe
that
she
felt
particularly
hurt
by
those
ridiculous
mortgage
bonds
on
paradise
ah
what
a
my
friend
never
before
was
human
imbecility
exploited
to
such
a
degree
by
religious
impudence
while
conversing
the
friends
had
slowly
directed
their
steps
towards
the
railway
station
where
salvan
intended
to
take
the
train
in
order
to
return
to
beaumont
he
did
so
and
marc
on
quitting
him
felt
once
again
full
of
hope
as
salvan
had
indeed
suggested
geneviève
in
that
little
house
of
the
place
des
capucins
which
had
become
yet
more
mournful
and
frigid
now
that
death
hovered
over
it
so
threateningly
was
assailed
by
another
crisis
which
was
gradually
transforming
her
at
first
she
had
been
thunderstruck
by
the
revelation
of
the
truth
the
certainty
of
innocence
which
the
perusal
of
all
the
documents
had
brought
her
that
terrible
light
whose
blaze
had
revealed
to
her
the
infamy
of
the
holy
men
whom
she
had
hitherto
accepted
as
the
directors
of
her
conscience
and
her
heart
all
came
from
that
doubt
penetrated
into
her
mind
faith
took
flight
she
could
not
do
otherwise
than
reflect
examine
and
judge
everything
a
feeling
of
disquietude
had
already
come
upon
her
at
the
time
when
she
quitted
father
théodose
and
the
bonds
of
antony
that
base
attempt
to
exploit
the
credulity
of
the
public
had
suddenly
shown
her
his
venality
and
disgusted
her
with
him
moreover
not
only
did
the
monk
character
decline
in
her
estimation
to
the
lowest
level
but
the
worship
he
represented
that
religion
which
had
cast
her
into
transports
of
mystical
desire
likewise
lost
its
semblance
of
holiness
what
must
she
accept
that
unworthy
trafficking
that
idolatrous
superstition
if
she
desired
to
remain
a
practising
catholic
steadfast
in
her
faith
she
had
long
bowed
to
beliefs
and
mysteries
even
when
her
natural
good
sense
had
covertly
protested
against
them
but
there
were
limits
to
everything
she
could
not
countenance
that
flotation
of
shares
in
heaven
she
refused
to
walk
behind
that
antony
bedaubed
with
red
and
gold
and
carried
about
like
a
guy
or
an
advertisement
to
increase
the
multitude
of
subscribers
and
the
revolt
of
her
reason
gathered
additional
strength
when
she
thought
of
the
retirement
of
abbé
quandieu
the
gentle
and
paternal
confessor
to
whom
she
had
returned
when
the
suspicious
ardour
of
father
théodose
had
alarmed
her
if
such
a
man
as
the
abbé
felt
unable
to
abide
in
the
church
such
as
it
had
been
made
by
the
clerical
policy
of
hatred
and
domination
was
it
not
certain
that
all
upright
souls
would
henceforth
find
it
difficult
to
remain
in
it
doubtless
however
geneviève
evolution
would
not
have
been
so
rapid
if
certain
preparatory
work
had
not
been
already
effected
in
her
slowly
and
without
her
knowledge
in
order
that
one
might
fully
understand
those
first
causes
it
was
necessary
to
recall
the
whole
of
her
story
inheriting
much
of
her
father
nature
tender
gay
and
amorous
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
marc
carried
away
by
such
ardent
passion
that
in
order
to
have
that
modest
schoolmaster
as
her
husband
she
was
willing
to
dwell
with
him
almost
in
poverty
in
the
depths
of
a
lonely
village
weary
too
in
her
eighteenth
year
of
the
mournful
life
she
had
led
beside
madame
duparque
the
idea
of
liberty
had
attracted
her
and
for
a
moment
it
had
seemed
as
if
she
had
cast
aside
all
her
pious
training
for
with
her
husband
she
had
displayed
such
youthful
enchantment
that
he
had
been
able
to
think
she
was
wholly
his
moreover
if
any
fears
lurked
within
him
he
had
dismissed
them
setting
himself
to
worship
her
imagining
he
would
be
powerful
enough
to
recast
her
in
his
own
image
and
so
carried
away
by
the
happiness
of
the
hour
that
he
deferred
that
moral
conquest
till
some
other
time
but
her
past
had
revived
and
again
he
had
shown
weakness
delaying
action
under
the
pretext
of
respecting
the
freedom
of
her
conscience
and
allowing
her
to
return
to
religious
observances
all
her
childhood
then
came
back
the
mystical
poison
which
had
not
been
eliminated
from
her
system
asserted
itself
and
the
crisis
which
fatally
assails
the
souls
of
women
nourished
on
errors
and
falsehoods
arrived
her
case
being
aggravated
by
her
frequentation
of
that
bigoted
and
domineering
woman
her
grandmother
then
a
whole
series
of
incidents
the
simon
case
the
postponement
of
louise
first
communion
had
precipitated
the
rupture
between
husband
and
wife
in
geneviève
there
glowed
a
desire
for
the
of
passion
a
hope
of
finding
in
heaven
the
divine
and
boundless
bliss
promised
to
her
formerly
in
her
girlish
days
and
her
love
for
marc
had
simply
become
dimmed
amid
her
dream
of
the
ecstasies
which
the
canticles
celebrate
an
ever
loftier
and
ever
deceptive
delight
but
in
vain
had
others
excited
her
lied
to
her
set
her
against
her
husband
by
promising
to
raise
her
to
the
highest
truth
the
most
perfect
felicity
the
failure
the
defeat
she
ever
encountered
sprang
from
her
abandonment
of
the
only
natural
and
possible
human
happiness
for
never
since
that
time
had
she
been
able
to
content
her
longings
she
had
lived
indeed
amid
increasing
distress
without
either
repose
or
joy
however
stubbornly
she
might
declare
that
she
had
found
felicity
in
her
deceptive
and
empty
chimeras
even
now
she
did
not
confess
in
what
a
void
she
had
ever
remained
after
her
long
prayers
on
the
old
flagstones
of
chapels
her
useless
communions
when
she
had
vainly
hoped
to
feel
the
flesh
and
blood
of
jesus
mingling
with
her
own
in
a
union
of
eternal
rapture
but
good
mother
nature
each
day
was
winning
her
back
restoring
her
a
little
more
to
health
and
human
love
while
the
old
poison
of
mysticism
became
in
an
increasing
degree
eliminated
at
each
successive
defeat
of
religious
imposture
cast
for
a
time
into
great
perturbation
she
strove
to
divert
her
thoughts
to
stupefy
herself
by
stern
and
painful
religious
practices
in
order
that
she
might
not
be
compelled
to
understand
that
her
love
for
marc
had
reawakened
that
she
craved
for
rest
in
his
embrace
in
the
one
sole
eternal
certainty
which
makes
of
husband
and
wife
the
emblems
of
health
and
happiness
but
quarrels
had
broken
out
between
madame
duparque
and
geneviève
and
had
grown
more
and
more
frequent
and
bitter
the
grandmother
felt
that
her
granddaughter
was
escaping
from
her
she
watched
her
closely
made
her
almost
a
prisoner
but
whenever
a
dispute
arose
geneviève
always
had
the
resource
of
shutting
herself
up
in
her
own
room
there
she
could
dwell
upon
her
thoughts
and
she
did
not
answer
even
when
the
terrible
old
woman
came
up
and
hammered
at
the
door
in
this
way
she
secluded
herself
on
two
successive
sundays
refusing
to
accompany
her
grandmother
to
vespers
in
spite
of
both
entreaties
and
threats
madame
duparque
now
years
old
had
become
a
most
uncompromising
bigot
fashioned
in
that
sense
by
a
long
life
of
absolute
servitude
to
the
church
reared
by
a
rigid
mother
she
had
found
no
affection
in
her
husband
whose
mind
had
been
set
on
his
business
for
nearly
five
and
twenty
years
they
had
kept
a
shop
in
front
of
the
cathedral
of
maxence
at
beaumont
a
shop
whose
custom
came
chiefly
from
the
convents
and
the
parsonages
and
it
was
towards
her
thirtieth
year
that
madame
duparque
neglected
by
her
husband
and
too
upright
to
take
a
lover
had
begun
to
devote
herself
more
and
more
to
religious
observances
she
checked
her
passions
she
quieted
them
amid
the
ceremonies
of
the
ritual
the
smell
of
the
incense
the
fervour
of
the
prayers
the
mystical
assignations
she
made
with
the
jesus
depicted
in
pious
prints
having
never
known
the
transports
of
love
she
found
sufficient
consolation
in
the
society
of
priests
and
not
only
did
she
derive
happiness
from
the
unctuous
gestures
and
caressing
words
of
her
confessor
but
even
his
occasional
rigour
his
threats
of
hell
and
all
its
torments
sent
a
delightful
quiver
coursing
through
her
veins
in
blind
belief
and
strict
adherence
to
the
most
rigid
practices
she
found
too
not
only
satisfaction
for
her
deadened
senses
but
the
support
and
governance
she
needed
in
her
weakness
as
a
daughter
of
the
ages
the
church
knows
it
well
it
does
not
conquer
woman
only
by
the
sensuality
of
its
worship
it
makes
her
its
own
by
brutalising
and
terrorising
her
it
treats
her
as
a
slave
habituated
to
harsh
treatment
for
centuries
a
slave
who
ends
by
feeling
a
bitter
delight
in
her
very
servitude
thus
madame
duparque
broken
to
obedience
from
her
cradle
days
was
one
of
the
subjugated
daughters
of
the
church
one
of
those
creatures
whom
it
distrusts
strikes
and
disciplines
turning
them
into
docile
instruments
which
enable
it
to
attack
men
and
conquer
them
in
their
turn
when
after
losing
her
husband
and
liquidating
her
business
madame
duparque
had
installed
herself
at
maillebois
her
one
occupation
her
one
passion
had
become
the
practice
of
that
authoritarian
piety
by
which
she
strove
to
remedy
the
spoiling
of
her
life
and
obtain
compensation
for
all
the
natural
joys
all
the
human
forms
of
happiness
which
she
had
never
known
and
the
roughness
with
which
she
tried
to
impose
her
narrow
chilling
faith
upon
her
granddaughter
geneviève
was
due
in
some
degree
certainly
to
the
regret
she
felt
at
having
never
experienced
the
felicity
of
love
which
she
would
have
liked
to
forbid
her
grandchild
as
if
it
were
indeed
some
unknown
and
perchance
delightful
hell
where
she
herself
would
never
set
foot
but
between
the
grandmother
and
the
granddaughter
there
was
the
doleful
madame
berthereau
she
likewise
seemed
to
be
only
a
devotee
bent
beneath
the
rule
of
the
church
which
had
taken
possession
of
her
from
the
moment
of
her
birth
never
for
a
single
day
had
she
ceased
to
follow
its
observances
with
loving
weakness
her
husband
berthereau
the
freethinker
had
accompanied
her
to
mass
but
she
had
also
known
his
love
the
ardent
passion
with
which
he
had
always
encompassed
her
and
the
recollection
of
it
possessed
her
for
ever
though
many
years
had
elapsed
since
his
death
she
still
belonged
to
him
she
lived
on
that
one
memory
ending
her
days
in
solitude
in
the
arms
of
that
dear
shade
this
explained
her
long
spells
of
silence
the
resigned
retiring
manner
she
preserved
in
the
mournful
little
house
to
which
as
to
a
convent
she
had
withdrawn
with
her
daughter
geneviève
she
had
never
thought
of
marrying
again
she
had
become
a
second
madame
duparque
rigidly
and
meticulously
pious
clad
invariably
in
black
and
showing
a
waxen
countenance
a
cowed
and
crushed
demeanour
under
the
rough
hand
which
weighed
so
heavily
on
the
house
at
the
utmost
a
faint
twinge
of
bitterness
appeared
on
her
tired
lips
and
a
fugitive
gleam
of
rebellion
shone
in
her
submissive
eyes
when
at
times
the
memory
of
her
dead
husband
awakening
within
her
filled
her
amid
the
frigid
empty
life
of
religious
observances
in
which
she
agonised
with
bitter
regret
for
all
the
old
happiness
of
love
and
of
recent
times
only
the
sight
of
her
daughter
geneviève
frightful
torment
that
struggle
of
a
woman
for
whom
priest
and
husband
were
contending
had
been
able
to
draw
her
from
the
shrinking
of
a
recluse
taking
no
interest
in
the
cares
of
worldly
life
and
lend
her
enough
courage
to
face
her
terrible
mother
and
now
madame
berthereau
was
near
her
death
well
pleased
personally
by
the
prospect
of
that
deliverance
nevertheless
as
her
strength
ebbed
away
day
by
day
she
felt
more
and
more
grieved
at
having
to
leave
geneviève
struggling
in
torture
and
at
the
mercy
of
madame
duparque
when
she
herself
was
gone
what
would
become
of
her
poor
daughter
in
that
abode
of
agony
where
she
had
suffered
so
dreadfully
already
to
the
poor
dying
woman
the
thought
of
going
off
like
that
without
doing
anything
saying
anything
that
might
save
her
daughter
and
help
her
to
recover
a
little
health
and
happiness
became
intolerable
it
haunted
her
and
one
evening
when
it
was
still
possible
for
her
to
speak
gently
and
very
slowly
she
mustered
sufficient
courage
to
satisfy
her
heart
it
was
an
evening
in
september
a
mild
and
rainy
one
night
was
at
hand
and
the
little
room
which
with
its
few
old
pieces
of
walnut
furniture
had
an
aspect
of
conventual
simplicity
was
gradually
growing
dim
as
the
sick
woman
could
not
lie
down
for
she
then
at
once
began
to
stifle
she
remained
in
a
sitting
posture
propped
up
by
pillows
on
a
couch
although
she
was
only
her
long
sad
face
crowned
by
snowy
hair
looked
very
aged
indeed
worn
and
blanched
by
the
emptiness
of
her
life
geneviève
sat
near
her
in
an
armchair
and
louise
had
just
come
upstairs
with
a
cup
of
milk
the
only
nourishment
which
the
ailing
woman
could
still
take
a
heavy
silence
was
lulling
the
house
to
sleep
the
last
clang
of
the
bells
of
the
capuchin
chapel
having
just
died
away
in
the
lifeless
atmosphere
of
the
little
deserted
square
daughter
at
last
said
madame
berthereau
in
accents
which
came
from
her
lips
very
faintly
and
slowly
we
are
alone
i
beg
you
to
listen
to
me
for
i
have
various
things
to
tell
you
and
it
is
quite
time
i
should
do
so
geneviève
surprised
and
anxious
as
to
the
effect
which
this
supreme
effort
might
have
on
her
mother
wished
her
to
remain
silent
but
madame
berthereau
made
such
a
resolute
gesture
that
the
young
woman
merely
inquired
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
alone
mother
would
you
like
louise
to
go
away
for
a
moment
madame
berthereau
preserved
silence
she
had
turned
her
face
towards
the
girl
who
tall
and
charming
with
a
lofty
brow
and
frank
eyes
gazed
at
her
in
affectionate
distress
and
the
old
lady
ended
by
murmuring
prefer
louise
to
remain
she
is
seventeen
she
also
ought
to
know
come
and
sit
here
close
beside
me
my
darling
then
the
girl
having
seated
herself
on
a
chair
by
the
side
of
the
couch
madame
berthereau
took
hold
of
her
hands
know
how
sensible
and
brave
you
are
she
said
if
i
have
sometimes
blamed
you
i
none
the
less
acknowledge
how
frank
you
are
do
you
know
now
that
i
am
near
my
last
hour
i
believe
in
nothing
save
kindness
again
she
paused
for
a
moment
reflecting
and
turning
her
eyes
towards
the
open
window
towards
the
paling
sky
as
if
she
were
seeking
her
long
life
of
dejection
and
resignation
in
the
farewell
gleam
of
the
sun
then
her
eyes
came
back
to
her
daughter
at
whom
for
a
while
she
remained
gazing
with
an
expression
of
indescribable
compassion
grieves
me
extremely
my
geneviève
to
leave
you
so
unhappy
she
said
do
not
say
no
i
sometimes
hear
you
sobbing
overhead
at
night
when
you
are
unable
to
sleep
and
i
can
picture
your
wretchedness
the
battle
which
rends
your
heart
for
years
now
you
have
been
suffering
and
i
have
not
had
even
enough
bravery
to
succour
you
hot
tears
gathered
suddenly
in
geneviève
eyes
the
evocation
of
her
sufferings
at
that
tragic
hour
quite
upset
her
i
beg
you
do
not
think
of
me
she
stammered
only
grief
will
be
that
of
losing
you
no
my
girl
each
has
to
go
in
turn
satisfied
or
in
despair
according
to
the
life
which
he
or
she
has
chosen
but
those
who
remain
behind
ought
not
to
persevere
obstinately
in
useless
suffering
when
they
may
still
be
happy
and
joining
her
hands
and
raising
them
with
a
gesture
of
ardent
entreaty
madame
berthereau
added
my
girl
i
beg
you
do
not
remain
a
day
longer
in
this
house
make
haste
take
your
children
and
go
back
to
your
husband
geneviève
did
not
even
have
time
to
answer
a
tall
black
form
was
before
her
for
madame
duparque
had
slipped
noiselessly
into
the
room
always
prowling
about
the
house
haunted
by
an
everlasting
suspicion
of
sin
she
began
to
worry
herself
directly
she
was
at
a
loss
to
tell
where
geneviève
and
louise
might
be
if
they
had
hidden
themselves
did
it
not
follow
that
they
must
be
doing
something
evil
moreover
the
old
woman
never
liked
to
leave
them
long
with
madame
berthereau
for
fear
lest
something
forbidden
should
be
said
that
evening
therefore
she
had
crept
up
the
stairs
as
quietly
as
possible
with
her
ears
on
the
alert
and
hearing
certain
words
she
had
gently
opened
the
door
thus
catching
the
others
flagrante
is
that
you
say
my
daughter
she
demanded
her
rasping
voice
ringing
with
angry
imperiousness
the
sick
woman
pale
already
became
quite
ghastly
at
that
sudden
intervention
while
geneviève
and
louise
remained
thunderstruck
alarmed
also
as
to
what
might
now
happen
is
that
you
say
my
daughter
madame
duparque
repeated
you
not
aware
that
god
can
hear
you
madame
berthereau
had
sunk
back
on
her
pillows
closing
her
eyes
as
if
to
collect
her
courage
she
had
so
greatly
hoped
that
she
might
be
able
to
speak
to
geneviève
alone
and
avoid
a
battle
with
her
redoubtable
mother
all
her
life
long
she
had
avoided
any
such
collision
any
such
struggle
feeling
that
she
would
be
beaten
in
it
but
now
she
had
only
a
few
hours
left
her
to
be
good
and
brave
and
so
she
opened
her
eyes
and
dared
at
last
to
speak
out
god
indeed
hear
me
mother
i
am
doing
my
duty
she
said
have
told
my
daughter
to
take
her
children
and
return
to
her
husband
for
she
will
only
find
real
health
and
happiness
in
the
home
which
she
quitted
so
imprudently
madame
duparque
who
waved
her
arms
violently
had
been
minded
to
interrupt
her
at
the
first
word
she
spoke
but
awed
perhaps
by
the
majesty
of
death
which
was
already
gathering
in
the
room
embarrassed
too
by
the
heartfelt
cry
of
that
poor
enslaved
creature
whose
reason
and
whose
love
were
at
last
freeing
themselves
from
their
shackles
the
terrible
old
lady
allowed
her
daughter
to
finish
her
sentence
a
pause
fraught
with
infinite
anguish
then
followed
between
those
four
women
who
were
thus
gathered
together
and
who
represented
four
generations
of
their
line
there
was
a
certain
family
resemblance
between
them
they
were
all
tall
they
had
long
faces
and
somewhat
prominent
noses
but
madame
duparque
now
eight
and
seventy
and
displaying
a
harsh
jaw
and
rigidly
wrinkled
cheeks
had
grown
lean
and
sallow
in
the
practice
of
narrow
piety
whereas
madame
berthereau
who
had
reached
her
year
showed
more
flesh
and
suppleness
in
spite
of
her
malady
and
still
retained
on
her
livid
face
the
gentleness
bequeathed
by
the
brief
love
which
she
had
tasted
and
which
she
had
ever
mourned
from
those
two
solemn
women
in
their
younger
days
had
sprung
geneviève
fair
and
gay
refined
by
paternal
heredity
loving
and
lovable
and
still
very
charming
at
seven
and
thirty
years
of
age
and
louise
the
last
who
would
soon
be
in
her
eighteenth
year
was
in
her
turn
a
brunette
with
hair
of
a
deep
gilded
brown
inherited
from
her
father
marc
who
had
also
bestowed
on
her
his
broad
forehead
and
his
large
bright
eyes
glowing
with
passion
for
truth
in
like
way
one
detected
among
those
four
women
the
progress
of
moral
evolution
first
there
was
the
a
serf
of
the
church
one
whose
flesh
and
mind
had
been
absolutely
subjugated
who
had
become
a
passive
instrument
of
error
and
domination
next
there
was
the
daughter
who
had
remained
a
practising
and
conquered
catholic
but
who
was
disturbed
tortured
by
her
brief
experience
of
human
happiness
then
came
the
struggling
granddaughter
in
whose
poor
heart
and
mind
catholicism
was
fighting
its
last
battle
who
was
almost
rent
atwain
between
the
mendacious
nothingness
of
her
mystical
education
and
the
living
reality
of
her
wifely
love
and
motherly
tenderness
who
needed
too
all
her
strength
to
free
herself
and
finally
there
was
the
who
was
at
last
freed
who
had
escaped
the
clutch
which
the
priest
sets
upon
women
and
children
and
who
all
youth
and
health
had
reverted
to
happy
nature
to
the
glorious
beneficence
of
the
sunlight
but
in
faint
slow
accents
madame
berthereau
was
repeating
my
geneviève
do
not
remain
here
any
longer
as
soon
as
i
am
gone
go
away
go
as
speedily
as
you
can
my
misfortunes
began
on
the
day
when
i
lost
your
father
he
adored
me
the
only
hours
that
i
ever
really
lived
were
those
that
i
spent
beside
him
and
i
have
often
reproached
myself
for
not
having
then
appreciated
them
more
for
in
my
stupidity
i
was
ignorant
of
their
value
and
i
only
understood
how
delightful
how
unique
they
had
been
when
i
came
here
a
widow
loveless
for
ever
cut
off
from
the
world
ah
the
icy
cold
of
this
house
how
often
has
it
made
me
shiver
ah
the
silence
and
the
gloom
in
which
i
have
gone
on
dying
for
years
not
even
daring
to
open
a
window
to
inhale
a
little
life
so
foolish
and
so
cowardly
i
was
erect
and
motionless
madame
duparque
still
refrained
from
interrupting
her
daughter
but
on
hearing
that
cry
of
dolorous
rebellion
she
could
not
restrain
a
gesture
of
protest
will
not
prevent
you
from
speaking
my
daughter
she
said
when
the
other
paused
if
you
have
a
confession
to
make
it
would
be
better
to
send
for
father
théodose
but
since
you
were
not
wholly
god
why
did
you
seek
refuge
in
this
house
you
knew
very
well
that
here
you
would
find
none
but
god
have
confessed
the
dying
woman
answered
gently
shall
not
go
off
without
receiving
extreme
unction
for
i
belong
to
god
entirely
i
can
only
belong
to
him
now
and
even
if
i
suffered
so
much
from
the
loss
of
my
husband
i
never
regretted
having
come
here
where
else
could
i
have
gone
i
had
no
other
refuge
i
was
too
closely
linked
to
religion
to
attempt
to
seek
other
happiness
even
for
an
instant
thus
i
have
lived
the
life
i
was
bound
to
live
but
my
daughter
in
her
turn
is
suffering
too
cruelly
and
i
will
not
have
her
begin
my
sorry
story
over
again
and
fade
away
in
the
void
in
which
i
have
agonised
for
so
many
years
for
she
is
free
and
she
still
has
a
husband
who
adores
her
you
hear
me
you
hear
me
do
you
not
my
daughter
with
a
gesture
of
tender
entreaty
she
held
out
her
poor
waxen
hands
and
geneviève
fell
upon
her
knees
beside
her
with
big
tears
rolling
down
her
cheeks
so
deeply
was
she
stirred
by
that
extraordinary
scene
that
poignant
awakening
of
love
at
the
very
hour
of
death
i
beg
you
mother
she
said
not
continue
to
grieve
about
my
sufferings
you
rend
my
heart
by
thinking
only
of
me
when
we
are
all
here
with
the
one
desire
to
give
you
a
little
comfort
whereas
you
it
seems
wish
to
go
off
in
despair
increasing
excitement
had
now
gained
possession
of
madame
berthereau
taking
geneviève
head
between
her
hands
she
gazed
into
her
eyes
and
answered
no
listen
to
me
there
is
only
one
thing
that
can
make
me
happy
before
i
leave
you
and
that
is
a
certainty
that
you
will
not
lead
a
life
of
sacrifice
and
torture
as
i
have
done
give
me
that
last
consolation
do
not
let
me
go
without
your
promise
i
shall
repeat
what
i
have
said
as
long
as
i
have
strength
to
do
so
leave
this
house
of
error
and
death
return
to
your
home
your
husband
give
him
back
his
children
love
each
other
with
all
your
strength
life
lies
in
that
and
truth
aye
and
happiness
also
i
beg
you
my
girl
promise
me
swear
to
me
that
you
will
comply
with
my
last
desire
then
as
geneviève
utterly
upset
choking
with
sobs
gave
her
no
answer
madame
berthereau
turned
towards
louise
who
likewise
distracted
was
now
kneeling
at
the
other
side
of
the
couch
me
my
dear
granddaughter
she
said
know
what
your
views
are
i
have
noticed
your
efforts
to
lead
your
mother
home
you
are
a
little
fairy
a
very
sensible
little
person
and
you
have
done
a
great
deal
to
give
a
little
quietness
to
all
four
of
us
your
mother
must
make
me
a
promise
is
it
not
so
tell
her
that
she
will
make
me
very
joyful
indeed
by
promising
me
to
be
happy
louise
had
caught
hold
of
the
poor
woman
hands
and
kissing
them
she
stammered
grandmother
grandmother
how
good
you
are
and
how
i
love
you
mother
will
remember
your
last
wishes
she
will
reflect
and
act
as
her
heart
bids
her
you
may
be
sure
of
it
madame
duparque
meanwhile
had
not
for
a
moment
departed
from
her
rigidity
her
eyes
alone
seemed
to
be
alive
in
her
frigid
wrinkled
face
and
furious
anger
blazed
in
them
while
she
strove
to
restrain
herself
from
any
brutal
action
at
last
she
growled
huskily
quiet
all
three
of
you
you
are
unhappy
infidels
rebelling
against
god
who
will
punish
you
with
the
flames
of
hell
be
quiet
i
tell
you
do
let
me
hear
another
word
am
i
no
longer
mistress
here
you
my
daughter
your
illness
has
impaired
your
mind
i
am
willing
to
grant
it
you
my
granddaughter
have
satan
in
you
and
i
excuse
you
for
having
failed
as
yet
to
drive
him
out
in
spite
of
your
penitence
and
you
my
i
still
hope
that
when
i
am
free
to
correct
you
i
shall
prevent
you
from
going
to
damnation
be
quiet
my
children
i
tell
you
if
it
were
not
for
me
you
would
not
exist
it
is
i
who
command
here
and
you
would
be
guilty
of
yet
another
mortal
sin
if
you
should
not
obey
me
her
stature
seemed
to
have
increased
and
her
voice
had
risen
while
with
fierce
gestures
she
thus
spoke
in
the
name
of
her
deity
of
anger
and
vengeance
but
in
spite
of
her
commands
her
daughter
who
already
felt
freed
from
her
domination
by
the
approach
of
death
was
bold
enough
to
continue
have
been
obeying
for
more
than
twenty
years
mother
i
have
preserved
silence
for
more
than
twenty
years
and
if
my
last
hour
were
not
at
hand
perhaps
i
should
be
so
cowardly
as
to
obey
and
keep
silent
now
but
i
have
gone
through
too
much
all
that
has
tortured
me
all
that
i
have
left
unsaid
would
choke
me
in
my
grave
and
even
there
the
cry
i
have
stifled
so
long
would
rise
from
my
lips
oh
my
daughter
promise
me
promise
me
what
i
ask
then
madame
duparque
beside
herself
exclaimed
in
a
rougher
voice
i
your
grandmother
forbid
you
to
speak
it
was
louise
who
seeing
that
her
mother
was
still
sobbing
waging
a
most
frightful
battle
with
her
face
close
pressed
to
the
blanket
spread
over
the
couch
took
upon
herself
to
answer
in
her
resolute
yet
deferential
way
one
must
be
kind
to
grandmother
who
is
so
ill
mother
also
is
very
ailing
and
it
is
cruel
to
upset
her
like
this
is
it
not
right
that
each
should
act
according
to
her
conscience
thereupon
without
giving
madame
duparque
time
to
intervene
again
geneviève
whose
heart
melted
touched
as
it
was
by
her
courageous
gentleness
raised
her
head
and
kissed
the
dying
woman
with
intense
emotion
mother
you
may
sleep
in
peace
i
will
not
let
you
carry
away
any
bitter
thought
on
my
account
yes
i
promise
you
i
will
remember
your
desire
i
promise
you
i
will
do
all
that
my
love
for
you
may
advise
me
to
do
yes
yes
there
is
only
kindness
there
is
only
love
therein
lies
the
only
truth
then
as
madame
berthereau
exhausted
but
with
a
divine
smile
brightening
her
face
pressed
her
daughter
to
her
bosom
madame
duparque
made
a
last
threatening
gesture
the
twilight
had
now
fallen
and
only
the
pale
gleam
of
the
broad
cloudless
sky
where
the
first
stars
were
shining
lighted
up
the
room
while
the
open
window
admitted
the
deep
silence
that
rose
from
the
deserted
square
broken
only
by
the
laugh
of
a
child
and
as
everything
thus
sank
into
a
quiescence
through
which
swept
the
august
breath
of
coming
death
the
old
woman
who
in
her
obstinacy
would
neither
see
nor
hear
added
these
words
belong
to
me
no
more
neither
daughter
nor
granddaughter
nor
one
impelling
the
other
you
are
all
three
of
you
on
the
road
to
eternal
damnation
go
go
god
casts
you
off
and
i
cast
you
off
also
then
she
departed
shutting
the
door
roughly
behind
her
in
the
dim
quiet
room
the
mother
remained
agonising
between
her
daughter
and
her
granddaughter
all
three
united
in
the
same
embrace
and
for
a
long
long
while
they
continued
weeping
their
tears
full
of
delightful
comfort
as
well
as
bitter
grief
two
days
later
madame
berthereau
died
in
a
very
catholic
spirit
after
receiving
extreme
unction
as
she
had
desired
at
the
church
the
stern
demeanour
of
madame
duparque
clad
in
the
deepest
mourning
was
much
remarked
only
louise
accompanied
her
geneviève
had
been
obliged
to
take
to
her
bed
again
overcome
by
such
a
nervous
shock
that
she
seemed
no
longer
able
to
see
or
hear
for
three
days
longer
she
thus
remained
in
bed
with
her
face
turned
to
the
wall
unwilling
to
answer
anybody
even
her
daughter
she
must
have
suffered
terribly
distressful
moans
escaped
her
fits
of
weeping
shook
her
from
head
to
foot
when
the
grandmother
went
up
to
her
obstinately
remaining
there
lecturing
her
and
pointing
out
the
necessity
of
appeasing
the
divine
anger
the
attacks
became
yet
more
violent
there
were
convulsions
and
shrieks
and
louise
who
wished
her
mother
to
be
spared
any
such
aggravation
of
her
torment
in
the
supreme
struggle
which
was
almost
rending
her
asunder
ended
by
bolting
the
door
and
remaining
there
as
a
sentinel
forbidding
access
to
everybody
on
the
fourth
day
came
the
pélagie
alone
managed
to
force
an
occasional
entry
in
order
to
attend
to
certain
work
sixty
years
of
age
with
a
sullen
face
a
large
nose
and
thin
lips
the
servant
had
become
not
only
very
thin
almost
withered
but
also
insufferable
in
manner
ever
mumbling
sour
words
she
actually
overruled
her
terrible
mistress
and
often
turned
the
whom
the
latter
engaged
to
help
her
into
the
street
madame
duparque
kept
her
however
for
she
was
an
old
retainer
an
old
instrument
who
had
always
been
ready
at
hand
indeed
her
mistress
could
hardly
have
lived
if
she
had
not
had
that
underling
that
serf
beside
her
to
extend
as
it
were
her
domination
over
all
around
she
employed
her
as
a
spy
as
the
executor
of
base
designs
and
in
return
she
herself
belonged
to
her
having
to
put
up
with
all
the
bad
temper
all
the
additional
worry
and
dolefulness
with
which
the
other
filled
the
house
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
after
the
first
breakfast
pélagie
having
gone
upstairs
to
fetch
the
cups
and
plates
hastened
down
again
quite
scared
and
said
to
her
mistress
madame
know
what
is
going
on
up
there
they
are
packing
their
trunks
mother
and
daughter
madame
oh
they
are
making
no
secret
of
it
the
girl
goes
from
one
room
to
the
other
carrying
armfuls
of
linen
if
madame
cares
to
go
up
the
door
is
wide
open
frigidly
without
answering
madame
duparque
went
up
and
she
indeed
found
geneviève
and
louise
actively
engaged
in
packing
two
trunks
as
if
for
immediate
departure
while
little
clément
who
was
scarcely
six
years
old
sat
very
quietly
on
a
chair
watching
the
preparations
the
mother
and
daughter
just
raised
their
heads
when
the
old
lady
entered
then
went
on
with
their
work
again
a
moment
of
silence
followed
finally
madame
duparque
not
a
muscle
of
whose
face
stirred
but
who
seemed
to
become
yet
more
frigid
and
stern
inquired
you
feel
better
then
geneviève
grandmother
i
have
still
some
fever
but
i
shall
never
get
well
if
i
remain
shut
up
here
you
have
decided
to
go
elsewhere
i
see
where
are
you
going
a
quiver
came
over
geneviève
who
once
more
raised
her
head
showing
her
eyes
which
were
still
red
with
weeping
am
going
where
i
promised
my
mother
i
would
go
for
four
days
past
the
struggle
has
been
killing
me
another
pause
ensued
promise
did
not
seem
to
me
a
formal
one
i
regarded
your
words
as
mere
words
of
consolation
said
madame
duparque
at
last
you
are
going
back
to
that
man
you
can
have
very
little
pride
ah
yes
i
know
it
is
by
pride
that
you
have
kept
me
here
so
long
but
i
have
had
plenty
of
pride
many
a
time
though
i
have
wept
all
night
long
i
have
refused
to
admit
my
error
but
now
i
understand
the
stupidity
of
my
pride
the
wretchedness
into
which
i
have
sunk
is
too
great
unhappy
creature
has
neither
prayer
nor
penitence
been
able
to
rid
you
of
the
poison
then
that
poison
is
mastering
you
again
and
it
will
end
by
casting
you
into
eternal
punishment
should
you
relapse
into
your
abominable
sin
poison
are
you
talking
of
grandmother
my
husband
loves
me
and
in
spite
of
everything
i
love
him
still
is
that
poison
i
have
struggled
for
five
years
i
wished
to
give
myself
entirely
to
god
why
did
not
god
fill
the
aching
void
of
my
being
in
which
i
desired
to
receive
him
alone
religion
has
satisfied
me
neither
as
to
wifely
happiness
nor
as
to
motherly
tenderness
and
if
i
am
now
going
back
to
that
happiness
and
tenderness
it
is
because
of
the
downfall
of
that
heaven
in
which
i
have
found
only
deception
and
falsehood
are
blaspheming
my
girl
and
you
will
be
punished
for
it
by
the
most
cruel
sufferings
if
the
poison
which
has
tortured
you
did
not
come
from
satan
it
follows
that
it
must
have
come
from
god
faith
is
forsaking
you
you
are
on
the
high
road
to
negation
to
absolute
perdition
is
true
for
months
now
i
have
believed
a
little
less
each
day
i
did
not
dare
to
confess
it
to
myself
but
amid
all
my
bitterness
of
feeling
something
was
slowly
destroying
the
beliefs
of
my
childhood
and
youth
how
strange
it
was
all
my
childhood
full
of
chimeras
all
my
pious
youth
had
revived
within
me
with
all
the
fine
mysteries
and
ceremonies
of
worship
when
i
first
sought
refuge
here
but
when
i
again
endeavoured
to
plunge
into
the
of
the
mysteries
when
i
strove
to
give
myself
to
jesus
amid
the
chants
and
the
flowers
those
dreams
gradually
faded
became
mere
deceptive
fancies
in
which
nought
of
my
being
found
contentment
yes
the
poison
must
have
been
my
training
the
errors
in
which
i
grew
up
which
brought
me
so
much
suffering
when
they
revived
and
of
which
i
shall
only
be
cured
when
the
evil
ferment
is
completely
eliminated
shall
i
ever
be
cured
i
hardly
know
there
is
still
such
strife
within
me
madame
duparque
was
restraining
herself
for
she
well
understood
that
violence
on
her
part
would
seal
her
rupture
with
the
young
woman
and
the
girl
who
with
the
little
boy
seated
on
his
chair
listening
attentively
without
understanding
were
all
that
remained
of
her
race
thus
she
was
minded
to
make
a
last
effort
and
addressing
herself
to
louise
she
said
my
poor
child
are
the
most
to
be
pitied
and
i
shudder
when
i
think
of
the
pit
of
abomination
into
which
you
are
casting
yourself
if
you
had
made
your
first
communion
all
these
sorrows
would
have
been
spared
us
god
is
punishing
us
for
having
failed
to
overcome
your
impious
resistance
yet
there
is
still
time
and
what
favours
would
you
not
obtain
from
his
infinite
mercy
if
you
would
only
submit
and
approach
the
holy
table
as
a
humble
handmaiden
of
jesus
but
the
girl
responded
gently
revert
to
that
grandmother
you
know
very
well
what
promise
i
gave
my
father
i
can
not
vary
in
my
answer
i
will
come
to
a
decision
when
i
am
twenty
i
shall
then
see
if
i
have
faith
you
unhappy
obstinate
child
if
you
go
back
to
that
man
who
has
wrecked
both
your
mother
life
and
your
own
your
decision
can
be
told
in
advance
you
will
remain
without
any
belief
any
religion
at
all
like
a
mere
beast
of
the
fields
then
as
the
daughter
and
mother
deferentially
preserved
silence
and
even
resumed
their
packing
in
order
to
curtail
a
useless
and
painful
discussion
the
old
lady
gave
expression
to
a
last
desire
if
you
have
both
resolved
to
go
at
least
leave
me
the
little
boy
leave
me
clément
he
will
redeem
your
folly
i
will
bring
him
up
in
the
love
of
god
i
will
make
a
holy
priest
of
him
and
at
least
i
shall
not
be
alone
there
will
be
two
of
us
to
pray
that
the
divine
anger
may
not
fall
upon
you
on
the
terrible
day
of
judgment
but
geneviève
had
sprung
to
her
feet
clément
she
exclaimed
it
is
largely
on
his
account
that
i
am
going
i
no
longer
know
how
to
bring
him
up
i
wish
to
restore
him
to
his
father
in
order
that
we
may
come
to
an
understanding
and
endeavour
to
make
a
man
of
him
no
no
i
am
taking
him
with
me
then
louise
who
also
stepped
forward
added
very
gently
and
respectfully
do
you
say
that
you
will
remain
alone
grandmother
we
do
not
wish
to
forsake
you
we
will
often
come
to
see
you
every
day
if
you
will
allow
us
and
we
will
love
you
well
and
try
to
show
you
how
much
we
desire
to
make
you
happy
madame
duparque
could
restrain
herself
no
longer
the
flood
of
anger
which
she
had
found
it
so
difficult
to
check
flowed
over
and
carried
her
away
with
a
rush
of
furious
words
enough
keep
quiet
i
will
listen
to
you
no
longer
but
you
are
quite
right
pack
your
boxes
and
be
off
be
off
all
three
of
you
i
cast
you
out
go
and
join
that
cursed
man
that
bandit
who
spat
on
god
and
his
ministers
to
endeavour
to
save
that
filthy
jew
who
has
been
twice
condemned
is
innocent
cried
geneviève
in
her
turn
losing
all
restraint
those
who
caused
him
to
be
condemned
are
liars
and
forgers
yes
i
know
it
is
that
affair
which
has
ruined
you
and
is
separating
us
you
imagine
the
jew
to
be
innocent
you
can
no
longer
believe
in
god
but
your
imbecile
justice
is
the
negation
of
divine
authority
and
for
that
reason
all
is
quite
over
between
us
go
go
as
quickly
as
possible
with
your
children
do
soil
this
house
any
longer
do
bring
any
more
thunderbolts
upon
it
you
are
the
sole
cause
of
its
misfortunes
and
mind
do
set
foot
here
again
i
cast
you
off
i
cast
you
off
for
ever
when
once
you
have
crossed
the
threshold
you
need
never
knock
at
the
door
it
will
not
be
opened
to
you
i
have
no
children
left
i
am
alone
in
the
world
and
i
will
live
and
die
alone
as
she
spoke
the
old
woman
nearly
in
her
eightieth
year
drew
up
her
lofty
figure
with
a
fierce
energy
her
voice
was
still
strong
her
gestures
were
commanding
ones
she
cursed
she
punished
she
exterminated
after
the
fashion
of
her
deity
of
wrath
and
death
and
afterwards
she
descended
the
stairs
with
a
pitiless
tread
and
shut
herself
in
her
room
waiting
there
till
the
last
children
of
her
flesh
should
be
gone
for
ever
it
so
happened
that
marc
that
very
same
day
received
a
visit
from
salvan
who
found
him
in
the
large
classroom
which
was
quite
bright
with
the
glow
of
the
september
sunshine
the
vacation
would
come
to
an
end
in
another
ten
days
and
though
marc
hourly
expected
to
be
informed
of
his
dismissal
he
was
consulting
his
books
and
notes
as
if
preparing
for
the
new
school
year
however
by
salvan
grave
if
smiling
demeanour
he
at
once
understood
the
truth
time
it
done
is
it
not
he
exclaimed
yes
it
done
my
friend
quite
a
long
list
of
changes
appointments
and
promotions
prepared
by
le
barazer
has
been
signed
jauffre
will
leave
jonville
and
come
to
beaumont
which
is
fine
advancement
for
him
that
clerical
chagnat
goes
from
le
moreux
to
dherbecourt
which
is
scandalous
when
one
remembers
what
a
brute
the
fellow
is
for
my
part
i
am
simply
pensioned
off
to
make
room
for
mauraisin
who
triumphs
and
you
my
friend
am
dismissed
eh
no
you
have
simply
fallen
into
disgrace
you
are
sent
back
to
jonville
in
the
place
of
jauffre
and
mignot
your
assistant
who
is
compromised
with
you
is
to
take
chagnat
post
at
le
moreux
marc
raised
a
cry
of
happy
surprise
i
am
delighted
salvan
who
had
come
expressly
to
acquaint
him
with
the
news
indulged
in
a
hearty
laugh
is
le
barazer
diplomacy
you
see
that
is
what
he
was
preparing
when
according
to
his
habit
he
endeavoured
to
gain
time
he
has
ended
by
satisfying
that
terrible
sanglebœuf
and
all
the
other
reactionaries
by
appointing
mauraisin
to
succeed
me
and
promoting
jauffre
and
chagnat
and
this
has
enabled
him
to
retain
your
services
and
those
of
mignot
outwardly
he
seems
to
blame
you
but
he
does
not
intend
to
disown
you
entirely
besides
he
is
leaving
mademoiselle
mazeline
here
and
in
your
place
is
appointing
joulic
one
of
my
best
pupils
a
man
of
free
and
healthy
mind
thus
maillebois
jonville
and
le
moreux
will
be
henceforth
provided
with
excellent
masters
ardent
missionaries
of
the
future
that
is
the
position
and
i
tell
you
once
again
nobody
can
alter
le
barazer
one
must
take
him
as
he
is
and
feel
pleased
even
when
what
he
does
is
only
half
of
what
one
would
like
to
see
am
delighted
marc
repeated
was
more
particularly
the
prospect
of
having
to
quit
the
profession
altogether
that
grieved
me
thinking
of
the
new
term
i
felt
sorrowful
all
this
morning
where
could
i
have
gone
what
could
i
have
done
it
will
certainly
pain
me
to
leave
the
boys
here
for
i
am
very
fond
of
them
but
my
consolation
will
be
to
find
others
yonder
to
whom
i
shall
also
become
attached
and
as
for
the
humbleness
of
the
school
what
does
that
matter
if
i
am
able
to
continue
my
and
still
sow
the
seed
which
alone
can
yield
the
harvest
of
truth
and
equity
ah
yes
i
shall
go
back
to
jonville
right
willingly
and
with
fresh
hope
then
he
strode
gaily
about
the
bright
sunshiny
classroom
as
if
again
taking
on
himself
that
teaching
mission
the
relinquishment
of
which
would
have
been
so
hard
to
bear
and
at
last
with
juvenile
ardour
and
delight
he
flung
his
arms
about
salvan
and
embraced
him
at
that
same
moment
mignot
who
also
expecting
dismissal
had
been
seeking
a
situation
for
some
days
past
came
in
worried
at
having
encountered
another
refusal
on
the
part
of
the
manager
of
a
neighbouring
factory
but
when
he
learnt
that
he
was
appointed
to
le
moreux
he
likewise
gave
expression
to
his
joy
moreux
le
moreux
a
real
land
of
savages
said
he
matter
one
will
try
to
civilise
them
a
little
and
we
be
separated
the
distance
is
less
than
three
miles
that
you
know
is
what
pleases
me
most
of
all
but
marc
had
now
calmed
down
and
indeed
sorrow
was
reviving
in
him
dimming
his
eyes
once
more
silence
fell
and
the
others
could
feel
a
quiver
pass
the
quiver
of
hope
deferred
of
a
which
was
ever
keen
how
hard
would
be
the
battle
that
marc
still
had
before
him
how
many
more
tears
must
he
shed
before
he
regained
his
lost
happiness
at
that
thought
he
and
the
others
also
preserved
silence
and
salvan
unable
to
give
his
friends
any
further
comfort
sank
into
a
sorrowful
reverie
as
he
stood
gazing
through
the
large
sunlit
window
which
faced
the
square
outside
but
all
at
once
he
exclaimed
are
you
expecting
somebody
somebody
rejoined
marc
at
a
loss
to
understand
here
comes
a
little
with
some
trunks
on
it
at
that
same
moment
the
door
opened
and
they
turned
round
it
was
geneviève
who
came
in
holding
little
clément
by
the
hand
and
having
louise
also
beside
her
the
surprise
and
the
emotion
were
so
great
that
at
first
nobody
spoke
marc
was
trembling
but
geneviève
in
a
halting
voice
began
at
last
dear
marc
i
have
brought
you
back
your
son
yes
i
give
him
back
to
you
he
belongs
to
you
he
belongs
to
us
both
let
us
try
to
make
a
man
of
him
the
boy
had
stretched
out
his
little
arms
and
the
father
caught
him
up
wildly
and
pressed
him
to
his
heart
while
the
mother
the
wife
continued
i
have
come
back
to
you
with
him
my
good
marc
you
told
me
that
i
should
bring
him
back
and
come
back
myself
it
was
truth
that
first
conquered
me
then
all
that
you
had
set
in
me
germinated
no
doubt
and
i
have
no
pride
left
and
here
i
am
for
i
still
love
you
i
vainly
sought
other
happiness
but
only
your
love
exists
apart
from
us
and
our
children
there
is
only
unreason
and
wretchedness
take
me
back
my
good
marc
i
give
myself
to
you
as
you
give
yourself
to
me
thus
speaking
she
had
slowly
drawn
near
to
her
husband
and
she
was
about
to
cast
her
arms
around
his
neck
when
louise
gay
voice
was
heard
i
and
i
father
i
must
share
in
it
too
you
know
you
must
not
forget
me
indeed
she
must
share
in
it
the
dear
girl
said
geneviève
strove
so
much
to
bring
about
this
happiness
she
showed
such
gentleness
and
skill
then
she
caught
louise
also
in
her
embrace
and
kissed
both
her
and
marc
who
was
already
holding
clément
to
his
heart
all
four
were
at
last
reunited
held
in
the
same
bond
of
flesh
and
love
having
but
one
heart
one
breath
between
them
and
what
a
quiver
of
deep
humanity
of
fruitful
and
healthy
joy
now
filled
that
large
classroom
which
looked
so
bare
and
empty
pending
the
return
of
the
boys
for
the
new
term
big
tears
welled
into
the
eyes
of
salvan
and
mignot
whom
emotion
quite
upset
at
last
marc
was
able
to
speak
and
his
whole
heart
rose
to
his
lips
my
dear
wife
as
you
return
to
me
you
must
at
last
be
cured
i
knew
it
would
be
so
you
turned
to
more
and
more
rigid
religious
practices
as
to
stronger
and
stronger
stupefacients
for
the
purpose
of
sending
your
nature
to
sleep
but
in
spite
of
everything
nature
was
bound
to
eliminate
the
poison
when
at
last
you
again
felt
that
you
were
a
wife
and
a
mother
yes
yes
you
are
right
love
has
delivered
you
you
are
won
from
that
religion
of
error
and
death
from
which
human
society
has
suffered
for
eighteen
centuries
past
but
geneviève
quivered
again
becoming
anxious
and
disturbed
no
no
my
good
marc
do
not
say
that
who
can
tell
if
i
am
really
cured
never
perhaps
shall
i
be
cured
completely
our
louise
will
be
entirely
free
but
the
mark
set
on
me
is
ineffaceable
i
shall
always
be
afraid
of
relapsing
into
those
mystical
dreams
and
if
i
have
come
back
it
is
to
seek
a
refuge
in
your
embrace
and
to
enable
you
to
complete
the
work
that
has
begun
keep
me
perfect
me
try
to
prevent
anything
from
ever
separating
us
again
they
caught
each
other
in
a
tighter
clasp
it
was
as
if
they
were
but
one
even
as
geneviève
had
said
was
not
that
the
great
work
which
needed
to
be
accomplished
the
work
of
taking
woman
from
the
church
and
setting
her
in
her
true
place
as
companion
and
mother
by
the
side
of
man
for
only
the
freed
woman
can
free
man
her
slavery
is
ours
but
all
at
once
louise
who
a
moment
previously
had
disappeared
opened
the
door
again
bringing
with
her
mademoiselle
mazeline
who
entered
breathless
and
smiling
said
the
girl
must
have
a
share
in
our
happiness
if
you
only
knew
how
she
has
loved
me
and
how
kind
and
useful
she
was
here
geneviève
stepped
forward
and
embraced
the
schoolmistress
affectionately
knew
it
she
said
you
my
friend
for
all
you
did
for
us
during
our
long
worries
the
good
woman
laughed
with
tears
in
her
eyes
do
thank
me
my
dear
it
is
i
who
am
grateful
to
you
for
all
the
happiness
you
give
me
salvan
and
mignot
were
also
laughing
now
more
handshakes
were
exchanged
and
as
salvan
amid
the
babel
of
voices
which
burst
forth
informed
the
schoolmistress
of
the
appointments
signed
the
previous
day
geneviève
raised
a
cry
of
joy
we
are
going
back
to
jonville
is
it
really
true
ah
jonville
that
charming
lonely
village
where
we
loved
each
other
so
well
where
we
first
lived
together
so
happily
what
a
good
omen
it
is
that
we
are
going
back
there
to
begin
our
life
afresh
in
affection
and
quietude
maillebois
made
me
feel
nervous
but
jonville
is
hope
and
certainty
renewed
courage
and
infinite
confidence
in
the
future
were
now
upbuoying
marc
filling
him
with
superb
enthusiasm
has
returned
to
us
said
he
we
are
and
even
though
falsehood
iniquity
and
crime
triumphed
eternal
victory
will
be
ours
book
iv
i
when
october
arrived
marc
with
joyous
serenity
repaired
to
jonville
to
take
the
modest
post
of
village
schoolmaster
which
he
had
formerly
occupied
there
great
quietude
had
now
fallen
on
him
new
courage
and
hope
had
followed
the
despair
and
weariness
by
which
he
had
been
prostrated
after
the
monstrous
trial
of
rozan
the
whole
of
one
ideal
is
never
realised
and
marc
almost
reproached
himself
for
having
relied
on
a
splendid
triumph
human
affairs
do
not
progress
by
superb
leaps
and
bounds
glorious
it
was
chimerical
to
imagine
that
justice
would
be
acclaimed
by
millions
of
lips
that
the
innocent
prisoner
would
return
amid
a
great
national
festival
transforming
the
country
into
a
nation
of
brothers
all
progress
the
very
slightest
the
most
legitimate
has
been
won
by
centuries
of
battling
each
forward
step
taken
by
mankind
has
demanded
torrents
of
blood
and
tears
hecatombs
of
victims
sacrificing
themselves
for
the
good
of
future
generations
thus
in
the
eternal
battle
with
the
evil
powers
it
was
unreasonable
to
expect
a
decisive
victory
a
supreme
triumph
such
as
would
fulfil
all
one
hopes
all
one
dream
of
fraternity
and
equity
among
mankind
besides
marc
had
ended
by
perceiving
what
a
considerable
step
had
been
taken
after
all
along
that
road
of
progress
which
is
so
rough
and
deadly
while
one
is
still
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
exposed
to
taunts
and
wounds
one
does
not
always
notice
what
ground
one
gains
one
may
even
think
oneself
defeated
when
one
has
really
made
much
progress
and
drawn
very
near
to
the
goal
in
this
way
if
the
second
condemnation
of
simon
had
at
first
sight
seemed
a
frightful
defeat
it
soon
became
apparent
that
the
moral
victory
of
his
defenders
was
a
great
one
and
there
were
all
sorts
of
gains
a
grouping
of
free
minds
and
generous
hearts
a
broadening
of
human
solidarity
from
one
to
the
other
end
of
the
world
a
sowing
of
truth
and
justice
which
would
end
by
sprouting
up
even
if
the
good
grain
should
require
many
long
winters
to
germinate
in
the
furrows
and
again
it
was
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
the
reactionary
castes
by
dint
of
falsehoods
and
crimes
had
for
a
time
saved
the
rotten
fabric
of
the
past
from
utter
collapse
it
was
none
the
less
cracking
on
all
sides
the
blow
dealt
to
it
had
rent
it
from
top
to
bottom
and
the
blows
of
the
future
would
complete
its
destruction
and
cast
it
down
in
a
litter
of
wretched
remnants
thus
the
only
regret
which
marc
now
experienced
was
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
utilise
that
prodigious
simon
affair
as
an
admirable
lesson
of
things
which
would
have
instructed
the
masses
enlightened
them
like
a
blaze
of
lightning
never
again
perhaps
would
there
be
so
complete
and
decisive
a
case
there
was
the
complicity
of
all
the
powerful
and
all
the
oppressors
banding
themselves
together
to
crush
a
poor
innocent
man
whose
innocence
imperilled
the
compact
of
human
exploitation
which
the
great
ones
of
the
world
had
signed
together
there
were
all
the
averred
crimes
of
the
priests
soldiers
magistrates
and
ministers
who
to
continue
deceiving
the
people
had
piled
the
most
extraordinary
infamies
one
on
another
and
who
had
all
been
caught
lying
and
assassinating
with
no
resource
left
them
but
to
sink
in
an
ocean
of
mud
and
finally
there
had
been
the
division
of
the
country
into
two
camps
on
one
hand
the
old
authoritarian
antiquated
and
condemned
social
order
on
the
other
the
young
society
of
the
future
free
in
mind
already
and
ever
tending
towards
increase
of
truth
equity
and
peace
if
simon
innocence
had
been
recognised
the
reactionary
past
would
have
been
struck
down
at
one
blow
and
the
joyous
future
would
have
appeared
to
the
simplest
whose
eyes
at
last
would
have
been
opened
never
before
would
the
revolutionary
axe
have
sunk
so
deeply
into
the
old
social
edifice
irresistible
enthusiasm
would
have
carried
the
nation
towards
the
future
city
in
a
few
months
the
simon
affair
would
have
done
more
for
the
emancipation
of
the
masses
and
the
reign
of
justice
than
a
hundred
years
of
ardent
politics
and
grief
that
things
should
have
become
so
spoilt
and
should
have
shattered
the
admirable
work
in
their
hands
was
destined
to
abide
in
the
hearts
of
the
combatants
as
long
as
they
might
live
but
life
continued
and
it
was
necessary
to
fight
again
fight
on
for
ever
a
step
had
been
taken
forward
and
other
steps
remained
to
be
taken
duty
demanded
that
day
by
day
whatever
the
bitterness
and
often
the
obscurity
of
life
one
should
again
give
one
blood
and
one
tears
satisfied
with
gaining
ground
inch
by
inch
without
even
the
reward
of
ever
beholding
the
victory
marc
accepted
that
sacrifice
no
longer
hoping
to
see
simon
innocence
recognised
legally
definitively
and
triumphantly
by
the
whole
people
he
felt
it
was
impossible
to
revive
the
affair
amid
the
passions
of
the
moment
for
the
innocent
man
enemies
would
begin
their
atrocious
campaign
again
helped
on
by
the
cowardice
of
the
multitude
it
would
be
necessary
no
doubt
to
wait
for
the
death
of
the
personages
involved
in
the
case
for
some
transformation
of
parties
some
new
phase
of
politics
before
the
government
would
be
bold
enough
to
apply
once
more
to
the
court
of
cassation
and
ask
it
to
efface
that
abominable
page
from
the
history
of
france
such
seemed
to
be
the
conviction
of
even
david
and
simon
who
while
leading
a
sequestered
life
busy
with
their
pyrenean
enterprise
watched
for
favourable
incidents
and
circumstances
but
felt
that
the
situation
tied
their
hands
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
remain
waiting
unless
indeed
they
wished
to
stir
up
another
useless
and
dangerous
onslaught
marc
being
thus
compelled
to
live
in
patience
reverted
to
his
mission
to
the
one
work
on
which
he
set
his
hopes
the
instruction
of
the
humble
the
dissemination
of
truth
by
knowledge
which
alone
could
render
a
nation
capable
of
equity
great
serenity
had
come
to
him
and
he
accepted
the
fact
that
generations
of
pupils
would
be
necessary
to
rouse
france
from
her
numbness
deliver
her
from
the
poisons
with
which
she
had
been
gorged
and
fill
her
with
new
blood
which
would
transform
her
into
the
france
of
his
old
dreams
a
generous
and
nation
never
had
marc
loved
truth
so
passionately
as
he
did
now
in
former
times
he
had
needed
it
even
as
one
needs
the
air
one
breathes
he
had
felt
unable
to
live
without
it
sinking
into
intolerable
anguish
whenever
it
escaped
him
at
present
after
seeing
it
attacked
so
furiously
denied
and
hidden
away
in
the
depths
of
lies
like
a
corpse
which
would
never
revive
he
believed
in
it
still
more
he
felt
that
it
was
irresistible
possessed
of
sufficient
power
to
blow
up
the
world
should
men
again
try
to
bury
it
underground
it
followed
its
road
without
ever
taking
an
hour
rest
it
marched
on
to
its
goal
of
light
and
nothing
would
ever
stop
it
marc
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
ironical
contempt
when
he
beheld
guilty
men
imagining
that
they
had
annihilated
truth
that
it
lay
beneath
their
feet
as
if
it
had
ceased
to
exist
when
the
right
moment
came
truth
would
explode
scatter
them
like
dust
and
shine
forth
serenely
and
radiantly
and
it
was
the
certainty
that
truth
ever
victorious
even
after
the
lapse
of
ages
was
upon
his
side
that
lent
marc
all
necessary
strength
and
composure
to
return
to
his
work
and
wait
cheerfully
for
truth
triumph
even
though
it
might
only
come
after
his
own
lifetime
moreover
the
simon
case
had
imparted
solidity
to
his
convictions
breadth
to
his
faith
he
had
previously
passed
condemnation
on
the
which
was
exhausted
by
the
abuse
of
its
usurped
power
which
from
being
a
liberal
class
had
become
a
reactionary
one
passing
from
free
thought
to
the
basest
clericalism
as
it
had
felt
the
church
to
be
its
natural
ally
in
its
career
of
rapine
and
enjoyment
and
now
he
had
seen
the
french
at
work
he
had
seen
it
full
of
cowardice
and
falsehood
weak
but
tyrannical
denying
all
justice
to
the
innocent
ready
for
every
crime
in
order
that
it
might
not
have
to
part
with
any
of
its
millions
terrified
as
it
was
by
the
gradual
awakening
of
the
masses
who
claimed
their
due
and
finding
that
to
be
even
more
rotten
more
stricken
than
he
had
imagined
he
held
that
it
must
promptly
disappear
if
the
nation
did
not
desire
to
perish
of
incurable
infection
henceforth
salvation
was
only
to
be
found
in
the
masses
in
that
new
force
that
inexhaustible
reservoir
of
men
work
and
energy
marc
felt
that
the
masses
were
ever
rising
like
a
new
rejuvenated
race
bringing
to
social
life
more
power
for
truth
justice
and
happiness
and
this
confirmed
him
in
the
mission
he
had
assumed
that
seemingly
modest
mission
of
a
village
schoolmaster
which
was
in
reality
the
apostolate
of
modern
times
the
only
important
work
that
could
fashion
the
society
of
there
was
no
loftier
duty
than
that
of
striking
down
the
errors
and
impostures
of
the
church
and
setting
in
their
place
truth
as
proclaimed
by
science
and
human
peace
based
upon
knowledge
and
solidarity
the
france
of
the
future
was
growing
up
in
the
rural
districts
in
the
humblest
loneliest
hamlets
and
it
was
there
that
one
must
work
and
conquer
marc
speedily
set
to
work
he
had
to
repair
all
the
harm
which
jauffre
had
caused
by
abandoning
jonville
to
abbé
cognasse
but
during
the
earlier
days
while
marc
and
geneviève
were
settling
down
how
delightful
it
was
for
them
reconciled
as
they
were
and
renewing
the
love
of
youthful
times
to
find
themselves
again
in
the
poor
little
nest
of
long
ago
sixteen
years
had
passed
yet
nothing
seemed
to
be
changed
the
little
school
was
just
the
same
with
its
tiny
lodging
and
its
strip
of
garden
the
walls
had
merely
been
whitewashed
but
the
place
seemed
fairly
clean
thanks
to
a
good
scouring
which
geneviève
superintended
she
was
never
weary
of
summoning
marc
to
remind
him
of
one
thing
and
another
laughing
happily
at
all
that
recalled
the
past
come
and
look
at
the
picture
of
useful
insects
which
you
hung
up
in
the
classroom
it
is
still
there
i
myself
put
up
those
pegs
for
the
boys
hats
in
the
cupboard
yonder
you
find
the
collection
of
solid
bodies
which
you
cut
out
of
beech
wood
marc
hastened
to
her
and
joined
in
her
laughter
and
in
his
turn
he
summoned
her
to
him
upstairs
make
haste
do
you
see
that
date
cut
with
a
knife
in
the
wall
of
the
alcove
do
you
remember
that
i
did
that
the
day
louise
was
born
and
just
recollect
when
we
were
in
bed
we
used
to
look
at
that
crack
in
the
ceiling
and
jest
about
it
saying
that
the
stars
were
watching
and
smiling
at
us
then
as
they
went
through
the
little
garden
they
burst
into
exclamations
look
at
the
old
fig
tree
it
has
changed
a
bit
we
might
have
left
it
only
yesterday
ah
we
had
a
border
of
strawberries
in
the
place
of
that
sorrel
we
shall
have
to
plant
one
again
the
pump
has
been
changed
that
a
blessing
perhaps
we
shall
be
able
to
get
water
with
this
one
why
there
our
seat
our
seat
under
the
creeper
we
must
sit
down
and
kiss
each
other
all
the
young
kisses
of
long
ago
in
a
good
kiss
of
they
felt
moved
to
tears
and
for
an
instant
they
lingered
embracing
amid
that
delightful
renewal
of
their
happiness
great
courage
came
to
them
from
the
sight
of
those
friendly
surroundings
where
they
had
never
shed
a
tear
everything
they
saw
drew
them
more
closely
together
and
seemed
to
promise
them
victory
with
respect
to
their
daughter
louise
a
separation
had
become
necessary
at
the
very
outset
she
had
been
obliged
to
leave
them
for
the
training
school
of
fontenay
to
which
she
had
secured
admission
her
tastes
and
her
love
for
her
father
had
made
her
desirous
of
becoming
a
mere
schoolmistress
even
as
he
was
a
mere
village
schoolmaster
and
marc
and
geneviève
remaining
alone
with
little
clément
saddened
by
their
daughter
departure
though
they
knew
it
to
be
necessary
drew
yet
closer
together
in
order
to
deaden
their
sense
of
that
sudden
void
true
clément
remained
with
them
and
gave
them
occupation
he
was
now
becoming
quite
a
little
man
and
it
was
with
affectionate
solicitude
that
they
watched
over
the
awakening
of
his
faculties
besides
marc
prevailed
on
geneviève
to
undertake
the
management
of
the
adjoining
girls
school
that
is
after
requesting
salvan
to
intervene
with
le
barazer
with
a
view
to
her
appointment
to
the
post
it
will
be
remembered
that
immediately
after
her
convent
days
she
had
obtained
the
necessary
certificates
and
that
if
she
had
not
taken
charge
of
the
girls
school
when
her
husband
was
first
appointed
to
jonville
it
had
been
because
mademoiselle
mazeline
had
then
held
the
post
but
the
advancement
now
given
to
jauffre
and
his
wife
had
left
both
posts
vacant
and
it
seemed
best
that
the
two
schools
should
be
confided
to
marc
and
geneviève
the
husband
taking
the
boys
and
the
wife
the
girls
this
indeed
being
an
arrangement
which
the
authorities
always
preferred
marc
for
his
part
perceived
all
sorts
of
advantages
in
it
the
teaching
would
proceed
on
the
same
lines
in
both
schools
he
would
have
a
devoted
collaborator
who
would
help
instead
of
trying
to
thwart
him
in
his
advance
towards
the
future
and
again
though
geneviève
had
given
him
no
cause
for
anxiety
since
her
return
she
would
find
occupation
for
her
mind
she
would
be
compelled
to
recover
and
exert
her
reason
in
acting
as
a
teacher
a
guardian
of
the
little
maids
who
would
be
the
wives
and
mothers
of
besides
would
not
their
union
be
perfected
would
they
not
be
blended
for
ever
if
with
all
faith
and
all
affection
they
should
share
the
same
blessed
work
of
teaching
the
poor
and
lowly
from
whom
the
felicity
of
the
future
would
spring
when
a
notification
of
the
appointment
arrived
fresh
joy
came
to
them
it
was
as
if
they
now
had
but
one
heart
and
one
brain
but
in
what
a
ruinous
and
uneasy
state
did
marc
now
find
that
village
of
jonville
which
he
had
loved
so
well
he
remembered
his
first
struggles
with
the
terrible
abbé
cognasse
and
how
he
had
triumphed
by
securing
the
support
of
mayor
martineau
that
illiterate
but
sensible
peasant
who
retained
all
a
peasant
racial
antipathy
for
the
priests
those
lazy
fellows
who
lived
well
and
did
nothing
between
them
marc
and
martineau
had
begun
to
secularise
the
parish
the
schoolmaster
no
longer
sang
in
the
choir
no
longer
rang
the
bell
for
mass
no
longer
conducted
his
pupils
to
the
catechism
classes
while
the
mayor
and
the
parish
council
escaped
from
routine
and
favoured
the
evolution
which
gave
the
school
precedence
over
the
church
thanks
to
the
action
marc
brought
to
bear
on
his
boys
and
their
parents
and
the
influence
he
exercised
at
the
parish
offices
where
he
held
the
post
of
secretary
he
had
seen
great
prosperity
set
in
around
him
but
as
soon
as
he
had
been
transferred
to
maillebois
martineau
falling
into
the
hands
of
jauffre
the
man
of
the
congregations
had
speedily
weakened
indeed
he
was
incapable
of
action
when
he
did
not
feel
himself
supported
by
a
resolute
will
racial
prudence
deterred
him
from
expressing
an
opinion
of
his
own
he
sided
with
the
priest
or
with
the
schoolmaster
according
as
one
or
the
other
proved
to
be
the
stronger
thus
while
jauffre
thinking
merely
of
his
own
advancement
chanted
the
litanies
rang
the
bell
and
attended
the
communion
abbé
cognasse
gradually
became
master
of
the
parish
setting
the
mayor
and
the
council
beneath
his
heel
to
the
secret
delight
of
the
beautiful
madame
martineau
who
though
not
piously
inclined
was
very
fond
of
displaying
new
gowns
at
high
mass
on
days
of
festival
never
had
there
been
a
plainer
demonstration
of
the
axiom
to
the
worth
of
the
schoolmaster
such
is
the
worth
of
the
school
and
according
to
the
worth
of
the
school
such
is
the
worth
of
the
parish
in
very
few
years
indeed
the
prosperity
which
had
declared
itself
in
jonville
the
ground
which
had
been
gained
thanks
to
marc
was
lost
the
village
retrograded
its
life
died
away
in
increasing
torpor
after
jauffre
had
delivered
martineau
and
his
into
the
hands
of
the
triumphant
cognasse
in
this
way
sixteen
years
elapsed
bringing
disaster
all
moral
and
intellectual
decline
leads
inevitably
to
material
misery
there
is
no
country
where
the
roman
church
has
reigned
as
absolute
sovereign
that
is
not
now
a
dead
country
ignorance
error
and
base
credulity
render
men
powerless
and
what
can
be
the
use
of
exercising
one
will
acting
and
progressing
if
one
be
a
mere
toy
in
the
hands
of
a
deity
who
plays
with
one
according
to
his
fancy
that
deity
suffices
supplies
the
place
of
everything
at
the
end
of
such
a
religion
of
terrestrial
and
human
nothingness
there
is
but
stupidity
inertia
surrender
into
the
hands
of
providence
mere
routine
in
the
avocations
of
life
idleness
and
want
jauffre
let
his
boys
gorge
themselves
with
bible
history
and
catechism
while
in
their
peasant
families
all
ideas
of
any
improved
system
of
cultivating
the
land
were
regarded
with
increasing
suspicion
they
knew
nothing
of
those
matters
they
would
not
learn
fields
remained
unproductive
crops
were
lost
for
want
of
intelligent
care
then
effort
seemed
excessive
and
useless
and
the
countryside
became
impoverished
deserted
though
above
it
there
still
shone
the
and
fructifying
sun
that
ignored
insulted
god
of
life
the
decline
of
jonville
had
become
yet
more
marked
after
abbé
cognasse
had
prevailed
on
the
weak
martineau
to
allow
the
parish
to
be
dedicated
to
the
sacred
heart
in
a
pompous
and
ceremony
the
peasants
were
still
waiting
for
that
sacred
heart
to
bring
them
the
wondrous
promised
harvests
by
dispelling
the
hailstorms
and
granting
rain
and
fine
weather
in
due
season
by
way
of
result
one
only
found
more
imbecility
weighing
on
the
parish
a
sleepy
waiting
for
divine
intervention
the
slow
agony
of
fanatical
believers
in
whom
all
power
of
initiative
has
been
destroyed
and
who
if
their
deity
did
not
nourish
them
would
let
themselves
starve
rather
than
raise
an
arm
during
the
first
days
that
followed
his
return
marc
on
taking
a
few
country
walks
with
geneviève
felt
quite
distressed
by
all
the
incompetency
and
neglect
he
beheld
the
fields
were
the
roads
scarcely
passable
one
morning
they
went
as
far
as
le
moreux
where
they
found
mignot
installing
himself
in
his
wretched
school
and
feeling
as
grieved
as
they
were
that
the
district
should
have
fallen
into
such
a
deplorable
state
have
no
idea
my
friends
said
he
the
ravages
of
that
terrible
cognasse
he
exercises
some
little
restraint
at
jonville
but
here
in
this
lonely
village
whose
inhabitants
are
too
miserly
to
pay
for
a
priest
of
their
own
he
terrorises
and
sabres
everybody
of
late
years
he
and
his
creature
chagnat
while
reigning
here
virtually
suppressed
the
mayor
saleur
who
felt
flattered
at
being
every
time
but
who
turned
all
the
worries
of
his
office
over
to
his
secretary
chagnat
and
by
way
of
exhibiting
his
person
let
himself
be
taken
to
mass
though
at
heart
he
scarcely
cared
for
the
priests
ah
how
well
i
now
understand
the
torments
of
poor
férou
his
exasperation
and
the
fit
of
lunacy
which
led
to
his
martyrdom
with
a
quivering
gesture
marc
indicated
that
he
was
haunted
by
the
thought
of
that
unhappy
man
struck
down
by
a
yonder
under
the
burning
sun
i
came
in
just
now
he
seemed
to
rise
before
me
famished
having
only
his
scanty
pay
to
provide
for
himself
his
wife
and
his
children
he
endured
untold
agony
at
feeling
that
he
was
the
only
intelligent
the
only
educated
man
among
all
those
ignorant
dolts
living
at
their
ease
who
disdained
him
for
his
poverty
and
feared
him
for
his
attainments
which
humiliated
them
that
explains
too
the
power
acquired
by
chagnat
over
the
mayor
the
latter
one
desire
being
to
live
in
peace
on
his
income
in
the
somnolent
state
of
a
man
whose
appetite
is
satisfied
the
whole
parish
is
like
that
mignot
replied
are
no
poor
and
each
peasant
remains
content
with
what
he
harvests
not
in
a
spirit
of
wisdom
but
from
a
kind
of
egotism
ignorance
and
laziness
if
they
are
perpetually
quarrelling
with
the
priest
it
is
because
they
accuse
him
of
slighting
them
of
not
giving
them
the
masses
and
other
ceremonies
to
which
they
consider
themselves
entitled
thanks
to
chagnat
in
his
time
something
like
an
understanding
was
arrived
at
and
indeed
all
that
was
said
and
done
here
in
honour
of
antony
of
padua
can
hardly
be
pictured
but
the
result
of
chagnat
is
deplorable
i
found
the
school
as
dirty
as
a
cowshed
one
might
have
thought
that
the
chagnats
had
lodged
all
the
cattle
of
the
district
in
it
and
i
had
to
engage
a
woman
to
help
me
to
scour
and
scrape
everything
geneviève
meantime
had
become
dreamy
her
glance
seemed
to
wander
away
to
memories
poor
férou
she
murmured
was
not
always
kind
to
him
and
his
family
that
is
one
of
my
regrets
but
how
can
one
remedy
so
much
suffering
and
disaster
we
have
so
little
power
we
are
still
so
few
there
are
times
when
i
despair
then
suddenly
waking
up
as
it
were
and
smiling
she
nestled
close
to
her
husband
and
resumed
there
do
scold
me
my
dear
i
did
wrong
to
speak
like
that
but
you
must
allow
me
enough
time
to
become
fearless
and
reproachless
as
you
yourself
are
come
it
understood
we
are
going
to
set
to
work
and
we
shall
conquer
thereupon
they
all
became
merry
and
mignot
who
wished
to
escort
his
friends
a
little
way
ended
by
accompanying
them
almost
to
jonville
there
at
the
roadside
stood
a
large
square
building
a
kind
of
factory
the
branch
establishment
of
the
good
shepherd
of
beaumont
which
had
been
promised
at
the
time
of
the
consecration
of
the
parish
to
the
sacred
heart
and
which
had
now
been
working
for
several
years
the
fine
clerical
folk
had
made
a
great
noise
about
the
prosperity
which
such
an
establishment
would
bring
with
it
all
the
daughters
of
the
peasants
would
find
employment
and
become
skilful
workwomen
there
would
be
a
great
improvement
in
their
morality
drones
and
gadabouts
would
be
duly
corrected
and
the
business
might
end
by
endowing
the
district
with
quite
an
industry
the
specialty
of
the
good
shepherd
establishments
was
to
provide
the
big
drapery
shops
of
paris
with
petticoats
knickers
and
chemises
the
finest
most
ornamental
and
most
delicate
feminine
body
linen
at
jonville
under
the
superintendence
of
some
ten
sisters
two
hundred
girls
worked
from
morning
till
night
trying
their
eyes
over
all
that
rich
and
fashionable
underwear
which
was
often
destined
for
strange
festivities
and
those
two
hundred
little
constituted
but
a
tiny
fraction
of
all
the
poor
hirelings
who
were
thus
exploited
for
the
order
had
establishments
from
one
to
the
other
end
of
france
nearly
fifty
thousand
girls
toiled
in
its
workshops
scantily
paid
and
while
they
earned
for
it
millions
of
francs
at
jonville
there
had
been
speedy
disenchantment
none
of
the
fine
promises
had
been
fulfilled
the
establishment
seemed
a
gulf
which
swallowed
up
the
last
energies
of
the
region
the
farms
were
raided
and
their
women
folk
carried
off
the
peasants
could
no
longer
keep
their
daughters
with
them
the
girls
all
dreamt
of
becoming
young
ladies
of
spending
their
days
on
chairs
engaged
in
light
work
but
they
soon
repented
of
their
folly
for
what
with
the
long
hours
of
enforced
immobility
the
exhausting
strain
of
unremitting
application
never
was
there
more
frightful
drudgery
the
stomach
remained
empty
the
head
became
heavy
there
was
no
time
for
sleep
in
summer
and
there
was
no
fire
in
winter
the
place
was
a
where
under
the
pretext
of
practising
charity
of
promoting
morality
woman
was
exploited
in
the
most
frightful
manner
sweated
in
her
flesh
stupefied
in
her
intelligence
turned
into
a
beast
of
burden
from
whom
the
greatest
gain
possible
was
extracted
and
scandals
burst
forth
at
jonville
one
girl
nearly
perished
of
cold
and
starvation
another
became
half
mad
while
another
turned
out
of
doors
penniless
after
years
of
crushing
toil
rebelled
and
threatened
the
good
sisters
with
a
sensational
lawsuit

made
use
of
numerous
incidents
brought
to
light
by
proceedings
in
the
french

and
also
by
the
action
of
the

looked
at

silent
like
a

geneviève
and
mignot
had
listened
thoughtfully
and
a
moment
of
anxious
silence
now
followed
amid
the
evening
quietude
while
the
sunset
cast
a
great
pink
glow
on
the
closed
and
mournful
factory
of
the
good
shepherd
i
myself
seem
to
be
despairing
now
marc
resumed
gaily
are
still
very
powerful
it
is
certain
but
we
have
a
book
on
our
side
the
little
book
of
elementary
knowledge
which
brings
truth
with
it
and
which
will
end
by
for
ever
overcoming
the
falsehoods
they
have
circulated
for
so
many
centuries
all
our
strength
is
in
that
mignot
they
may
accumulate
ruins
here
they
may
lead
poor
ignorant
folk
backward
and
destroy
the
little
good
done
by
us
formerly
but
it
will
suffice
for
us
to
resume
our
efforts
to
bring
about
progress
by
knowledge
and
we
shall
regain
the
lost
ground
and
continue
to
advance
until
we
at
last
reach
the
city
of
solidarity
and
peace
their
of
the
good
shepherd
will
crumble
like
all
others
their
sacred
heart
will
go
whither
all
the
gross
fetiches
of
the
dead
religions
have
gone
you
hear
me
mignot
each
pupil
in
whom
you
instil
a
little
truth
will
be
another
helper
in
the
cause
of
justice
so
to
work
to
work
victory
is
certain
whatever
difficulties
and
sufferings
may
be
encountered
on
the
road
that
cry
of
faith
and
everlasting
hope
rang
out
across
the
quiet
countryside
amid
the
calm
setting
of
the
planet
which
foretold
a
bright
and
mignot
bravely
returned
to
his
task
at
le
moreux
while
marc
and
geneviève
went
homeward
to
begin
their
work
at
jonville
arduous
work
it
was
requiring
much
will
and
patience
for
it
was
necessary
to
free
mayor
martineau
the
parish
council
and
indeed
the
whole
village
from
the
hands
of
the
priest
who
was
determined
not
to
relax
his
hold
on
hearing
of
marc
appointment
abbé
cognasse
instead
of
evincing
any
anger
or
fear
of
the
redoubtable
adversary
who
was
being
sent
to
face
him
had
contented
himself
with
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
affecting
extreme
contempt
he
said
on
all
sides
that
this
beaten
man
this
disgraced
mediocrity
who
had
lost
all
honour
by
his
complicity
in
the
simon
case
would
not
remain
six
months
at
jonville
his
superiors
had
merely
sent
him
there
in
order
to
finish
him
off
not
wishing
to
execute
him
at
one
blow
in
reality
no
doubt
abbé
cognasse
scarcely
felt
at
ease
for
he
knew
the
man
he
had
to
deal
with
a
man
all
calmness
and
strength
derived
from
his
reliance
on
truth
and
that
the
priest
plainly
scented
danger
was
shown
by
the
prudence
and
which
he
himself
strove
to
preserve
for
fear
of
spoiling
everything
if
he
should
yield
to
some
of
his
customary
fits
of
passion
thus
the
unexpected
spectacle
of
a
superbly
diplomatic
abbé
cognasse
who
left
to
providence
the
duty
of
striking
down
the
enemy
was
presented
to
the
village
as
his
servant
palmyre
who
with
increasing
age
had
become
quite
terrible
did
not
possess
sufficient
to
imitate
his
silent
contempt
he
scolded
her
in
public
when
she
ventured
to
declare
that
the
new
schoolmaster
had
stolen
some
consecrated
wafers
from
the
church
at
maillebois
for
the
purpose
of
profaning
them
in
the
presence
of
his
pupils
that
was
not
proved
said
the
abbé
nor
was
there
any
proof
of
the
story
that
hell
had
lent
marc
a
devil
who
on
being
summoned
stepped
out
of
the
wall
and
helped
him
with
his
indoors
however
all
was
agreement
between
the
priest
and
the
servant
who
both
displayed
extraordinary
greed
and
avarice
the
former
picking
up
as
many
masses
as
possible
the
latter
keeping
the
accounts
and
growling
angrily
when
money
did
not
come
in
with
reference
to
marc
then
there
ensued
on
the
abbé
part
a
stealthy
and
venomous
campaign
with
the
object
of
destroying
both
the
master
and
his
school
in
order
that
he
cognasse
might
continue
to
reign
over
the
parish
marc
on
his
side
behaved
as
if
the
church
and
the
priest
did
not
exist
to
win
back
martineau
the
council
and
the
inhabitants
he
contented
himself
with
teaching
the
truth
with
promoting
the
triumph
of
reason
over
ridiculous
dogmas
limiting
himself
strictly
to
his
duties
as
a
master
convinced
as
he
was
that
the
true
and
the
good
would
prove
victorious
when
he
should
have
fashioned
hearts
and
minds
capable
of
will
and
understanding
he
had
necessarily
resumed
the
duties
of
secretary
at
the
parish
office
but
he
there
contented
himself
with
discreetly
advising
martineau
who
at
heart
was
well
pleased
by
his
return
the
mayor
had
already
had
a
quarrel
with
his
wife
respecting
the
chanting
of
mass
which
chanting
abbé
cognasse
had
done
away
with
now
that
jauffre
was
no
longer
there
and
there
was
also
the
ancient
and
everlasting
quarrel
about
the
church
clock
which
would
not
work
the
first
thing
which
showed
that
a
change
had
taken
place
at
jonville
was
the
vote
of
a
sum
of
three
hundred
francs
by
the
council
for
the
purchase
of
a
new
clock
which
was
fixed
to
the
pediment
of
the
parish
offices
this
seemed
a
very
bold
step
to
take
but
it
met
with
the
approval
of
the
villagers
they
would
at
last
know
the
correct
time
which
the
rusty
old
clock
of
the
church
no
longer
gave
however
marc
avoided
any
semblance
of
triumph
he
knew
that
years
would
be
needed
to
regain
all
the
lost
ground
each
day
would
bring
a
little
progress
and
he
patiently
sowed
the
future
convinced
that
those
peasants
would
come
over
to
his
side
when
they
found
in
truth
the
one
sole
source
of
health
prosperity
and
peace
and
now
for
marc
and
geneviève
came
fruitful
years
of
work
and
happiness
he
in
particular
had
never
felt
so
courageous
and
strong
the
loving
return
of
his
wife
and
the
complete
union
which
had
followed
it
brought
him
fresh
power
for
his
life
now
accorded
with
his
work
in
former
times
he
had
greatly
suffered
at
finding
that
while
he
claimed
to
teach
truth
to
others
he
could
not
convince
the
companion
of
his
life
the
wife
he
loved
the
mother
of
his
children
and
he
had
felt
hampered
in
his
task
of
wresting
others
from
error
when
from
weakness
or
powerlessness
he
tolerated
error
in
his
own
home
but
now
he
possessed
irresistible
strength
all
the
authority
which
comes
to
one
from
example
from
the
realisation
of
happiness
at
the
family
hearth
through
perfect
agreement
and
a
common
faith
and
what
healthy
delight
there
was
in
the
prosecution
of
the
same
work
by
the
husband
and
the
wife
acting
in
conjunction
one
with
the
other
and
yet
freely
each
retaining
the
exercise
of
his
or
her
individuality
moments
of
weakness
still
came
occasionally
to
geneviève
but
marc
scarcely
intervened
he
preferred
to
let
her
regret
and
repair
the
errors
arising
from
the
past
of
her
own
accord
every
evening
when
the
boys
and
girls
had
gone
home
the
master
and
the
mistress
found
themselves
together
in
their
little
lodging
and
talked
of
the
children
confided
to
them
taking
account
of
the
work
and
coming
to
an
understanding
respecting
the
work
of
the
morrow
though
without
binding
themselves
to
identical
programmes
geneviève
being
sentimentally
inclined
endeavoured
the
more
particularly
to
make
sincere
and
happy
creatures
of
her
girls
trying
to
free
them
from
the
ancient
slavery
less
by
knowledge
than
by
sense
and
love
for
fear
of
casting
them
into
pride
and
solitude
marc
perhaps
would
have
gone
further
and
have
fed
both
boys
and
girls
on
the
same
knowledge
leaving
life
to
indicate
the
social
of
each
sex
before
long
the
great
regret
experienced
by
himself
and
his
wife
was
that
they
did
not
direct
a
mixed
school
like
mignot
at
le
moreux
whose
population
of
little
more
than
two
hundred
souls
supplied
scarcely
a
dozen
boys
and
as
many
girls
at
jonville
which
numbered
nearly
eight
hundred
inhabitants
the
master
had
some
thirty
boys
under
him
and
the
mistress
some
thirty
girls
had
they
been
united
what
a
fine
class
there
would
have
been
marc
acting
as
director
and
geneviève
as
his
assistant
such
indeed
was
their
idea
had
they
been
in
authority
they
would
no
longer
have
separated
the
girls
from
the
boys
they
would
have
entrusted
all
those
little
folk
to
a
married
couple
a
father
and
a
mother
who
would
have
educated
and
reared
them
one
with
the
other
as
if
they
all
belonged
to
their
own
family
they
held
that
all
sorts
of
advantages
would
result
from
such
a
course
a
more
logical
apprenticeship
of
life
excellent
emulation
more
frank
and
gentle
manners
in
particular
the
adjunction
of
the
wife
to
the
husband
as
an
assistant
seemed
likely
to
prove
fruitful
in
good
results
briefly
they
would
have
liked
to
pull
down
the
wall
which
separated
their
pupils
from
one
another
in
such
wise
as
to
have
had
but
one
school
a
little
miniature
world
in
which
he
would
have
set
his
virility
she
her
tenderness
and
what
good
work
would
they
not
then
have
accomplished
devoting
themselves
entirely
to
those
little
couples
of
the
future
but
the
regulations
had
to
be
observed
and
marc
on
resuming
his
work
pursued
the
methods
that
he
had
followed
at
maillebois
for
fifteen
years
his
class
was
smaller
than
it
had
been
there
and
his
resources
were
more
limited
but
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
being
almost
and
his
action
became
more
direct
and
efficacious
after
all
what
did
it
matter
if
the
number
of
pupils
whom
he
fashioned
into
men
was
only
a
score
or
so
had
each
schoolmaster
in
all
the
little
villages
followed
marc
example
so
as
to
endow
the
nation
with
twenty
just
and
sensible
men
the
result
would
have
sufficed
to
make
france
the
emancipator
of
the
world
another
source
of
contentment
for
marc
was
that
he
secured
almost
complete
liberty
of
action
from
mauraisin
successor
the
new
elementary
inspector
mauroy
to
whom
le
barazer
whose
friend
he
was
had
discreetly
given
special
instructions
the
village
was
so
small
that
marc
doings
could
not
attract
much
attention
and
thus
he
was
able
to
pursue
his
methods
without
any
great
interference
as
a
first
step
he
again
got
rid
of
all
religious
emblems
all
pictures
copybooks
and
books
in
which
the
supernatural
was
shown
triumphant
and
in
which
war
massacre
and
rapine
appeared
as
ideals
of
power
and
beauty
he
considered
that
it
was
a
crime
to
poison
a
lad
brain
with
a
belief
in
miracles
and
to
set
brute
force
assassination
and
theft
in
the
front
rank
as
manly
and
patriotic
duties
such
teaching
could
only
produce
imbecile
inertia
sudden
criminal
frenzy
iniquity
and
wretchedness
marc
dream
on
the
contrary
was
to
set
pictures
of
work
and
peace
before
his
pupils
to
show
sovereign
reason
ruling
the
world
justice
establishing
brotherliness
among
men
the
ancient
violence
of
warlike
ages
being
condemned
and
giving
place
to
agreement
among
all
nations
in
order
that
they
might
arrive
at
the
greatest
possible
happiness
and
having
rid
his
class
of
the
poisonous
ferments
of
the
past
marc
particularly
instructed
his
pupils
in
civic
morality
striving
to
make
each
a
citizen
well
informed
about
his
country
and
able
to
serve
and
love
it
without
setting
it
apart
from
the
rest
of
mankind
marc
held
that
france
ought
no
longer
to
dream
of
conquering
the
world
by
arms
but
rather
by
the
irresistible
force
of
ideas
and
by
setting
an
example
of
so
much
freedom
truth
and
equity
that
she
would
deliver
all
other
countries
and
enjoy
the
glory
of
founding
with
them
the
great
confederation
of
free
and
brotherly
nations
for
the
rest
marc
tried
to
conform
to
the
school
programmes
though
as
they
were
very
heavy
he
occasionally
set
them
aside
experience
had
taught
him
that
learning
was
nothing
if
one
did
not
understand
what
one
learnt
and
if
one
could
not
put
it
to
use
accordingly
without
excluding
books
he
gave
great
development
to
oral
lessons
and
once
again
he
strove
to
rejuvenate
himself
to
share
the
pastimes
of
his
pupils
and
descend
as
it
were
to
their
mental
level
in
such
wise
that
like
them
he
seemed
to
be
learning
seeking
truth
and
making
discoveries
it
was
in
the
fields
also
that
he
explained
to
them
how
the
soil
ought
to
be
cultivated
and
he
took
them
to
carpenters
locksmiths
and
masons
in
order
that
they
might
acquire
correct
ideas
of
manual
work
in
his
opinion
moreover
it
was
fit
that
gymnastics
should
partake
of
the
character
of
amusement
and
thus
playtime
was
largely
devoted
to
bodily
exercise
again
marc
took
on
himself
the
office
of
a
judge
he
requested
his
boys
to
lay
all
their
little
differences
before
him
and
he
strove
to
make
his
decisions
acceptable
to
all
parties
for
not
only
did
he
possess
absolute
faith
in
the
beneficent
power
of
truth
upon
young
minds
but
he
was
also
convinced
of
the
necessity
of
equity
to
content
and
ripen
them
by
truth
and
justice
towards
love
such
was
his
motto
a
boy
to
whom
one
never
tells
a
falsehood
whom
one
treats
invariably
with
justice
becomes
a
friendly
sensible
intelligent
and
healthy
man
and
this
was
why
marc
kept
such
a
careful
watch
over
the
books
which
the
curriculum
compelled
him
to
place
in
the
hands
of
his
pupils
for
he
well
knew
that
the
best
of
them
written
with
the
most
excellent
intentions
were
still
full
of
ancient
falsehoods
the
great
iniquities
consecrated
by
history
if
he
distrusted
phrases
and
words
the
sense
of
which
seemed
likely
to
escape
his
little
peasants
and
endeavoured
to
interpret
them
in
clear
and
simple
language
he
feared
yet
more
the
dangerous
legends
the
errors
of
articles
of
faith
the
abominable
notions
set
forth
in
the
name
of
a
mendacious
religion
and
a
false
patriotism
there
was
often
no
difference
between
the
books
written
by
clerics
for
the
brothers
schools
and
those
which
university
men
prepared
for
the
secular
ones
the
intentional
errors
contained
in
the
former
were
reproduced
in
the
latter
and
it
was
impossible
for
marc
to
refrain
from
intervening
and
refuting
those
errors
by
verbal
explanations
since
it
was
essentially
his
task
to
fight
the
congregational
system
of
teaching
that
source
of
all
falsehood
and
all
misery
for
four
years
marc
and
geneviève
worked
on
modestly
but
efficaciously
silently
accomplishing
as
much
good
as
was
possible
in
their
little
sphere
generations
of
children
followed
one
another
and
to
the
master
and
the
mistress
it
seemed
that
fifty
years
would
have
sufficed
to
rejuvenate
the
world
if
each
child
on
reaching
maturity
had
contributed
to
it
a
little
more
truth
and
justice
four
years
of
effort
had
certainly
not
yielded
a
marked
result
but
many
good
symptoms
were
manifest
the
future
was
already
rising
from
the
fruitful
soil
sown
so
perseveringly
salvan
after
being
pensioned
off
had
ended
by
taking
up
his
abode
at
jonville
in
a
little
house
left
him
by
a
cousin
he
lived
there
like
a
sage
with
just
enough
money
to
provide
for
his
wants
and
indulge
in
the
cultivation
of
a
few
flowers
in
his
garden
under
an
arbour
of
roses
and
clematis
there
was
a
large
stone
table
round
which
on
sundays
he
liked
to
assemble
a
few
friends
former
pupils
of
the
training
college
who
chatted
fraternised
and
indulged
together
in
fine
dreams
salvan
was
the
patriarch
of
the
gathering
which
marc
joined
every
sunday
his
satisfaction
being
complete
whenever
he
there
met
joulic
his
successor
at
maillebois
from
whom
he
obtained
information
about
his
old
school
joulic
was
a
tall
slim
fair
young
man
gentle
yet
energetic
who
had
taken
to
the
teaching
profession
by
taste
and
in
order
to
escape
the
brutifying
office
life
from
which
his
father
a
petty
clerk
had
suffered
one
of
salvan
best
pupils
he
brought
to
his
work
a
mind
liberated
from
all
absurd
dogmas
won
over
entirely
to
experimental
methods
and
thanks
to
a
great
deal
of
shrewdness
and
quiet
firmness
which
had
enabled
him
to
avoid
the
traps
set
for
him
by
the
congregations
he
proved
very
successful
at
maillebois
he
had
lately
married
a
schoolmaster
daughter
a
fair
little
creature
gentle
like
himself
and
this
had
helped
to
make
his
school
an
abode
of
gaiety
and
peace
one
sunday
when
marc
reached
salvan
he
found
joulic
already
chatting
with
the
master
of
the
house
at
the
stone
table
in
the
flowery
arbour
and
they
at
the
sight
of
him
at
once
made
merry
on
my
friend
cried
salvan
joulic
telling
me
that
some
more
boys
have
left
the
brothers
school
at
maillebois
people
say
that
we
are
beaten
but
we
work
on
quietly
and
our
action
spreads
and
triumphs
more
and
more
each
year
joulic
added
is
progressing
at
maillebois
which
once
seemed
to
be
the
rotten
borough
of
clericalism
brother
joachim
fulgence
successor
is
certainly
a
very
clever
man
as
artful
and
as
prudent
as
the
other
was
wild
and
rough
but
he
can
not
overcome
the
distrust
of
the
families
of
the
town
the
turn
which
public
opinion
has
taken
against
the
congregational
schools
where
the
studies
are
indifferent
and
the
morals
doubtful
simon
may
have
been
reconvicted
but
all
the
same
the
ghost
of
gorgias
returns
to
the
spot
which
he
polluted
and
his
very
defenders
are
haunted
by
the
memory
of
his
crime
and
thus
i
recruit
each
boy
who
leaves
the
ignorantines
marc
who
had
now
seated
himself
laughed
and
thanked
his
young
colleague
do
know
how
much
your
news
pleases
me
my
dear
joulic
he
replied
i
quitted
maillebois
i
left
a
part
of
my
heart
there
and
i
felt
worried
as
to
what
might
become
of
the
work
which
i
had
been
pursuing
for
fifteen
years
but
i
have
long
ceased
to
feel
any
anxiety
knowing
my
old
school
to
be
in
such
capable
hands
as
yours
yes
if
some
of
the
poison
which
infected
maillebois
has
been
eliminated
it
is
because
the
pupils
who
quit
you
year
by
year
become
men
of
sense
and
equity
ask
your
old
master
salvan
what
he
thinks
of
you
but
joulic
with
a
gesture
curtailed
marc
praises
no
said
he
am
only
a
pawn
in
the
great
battle
if
i
am
worth
anything
i
owe
it
to
my
training
so
that
the
chief
merit
belongs
to
our
master
besides
i
am
not
alone
at
maillebois
i
derive
the
most
precious
help
i
will
even
say
the
greatest
support
from
mademoiselle
mazeline
she
has
often
consoled
and
encouraged
me
you
can
not
imagine
how
much
moral
energy
that
gentle
and
sensible
woman
possesses
a
large
part
of
our
success
is
due
to
her
for
it
is
she
who
has
gradually
won
family
people
over
to
our
cause
by
turning
out
so
many
good
wives
and
mothers
when
a
woman
personifies
truth
justice
and
love
she
becomes
the
greatest
power
in
the
world
joulic
paused
for
at
that
moment
mignot
made
his
appearance
those
sunday
meetings
brought
delightful
relaxation
to
marc
former
assistant
who
cheerfully
walked
the
two
and
a
half
miles
which
separated
le
moreux
from
jonville
having
caught
joulic
last
words
he
at
once
exclaimed
mademoiselle
mazeline
do
you
know
that
i
wanted
to
marry
her
i
never
mentioned
it
but
i
may
admit
it
now
it
is
all
very
well
to
say
that
she
is
plain
but
at
maillebois
on
seeing
how
good
and
sensible
how
admirable
she
was
i
dreamt
of
her
and
one
day
i
told
her
of
my
idea
you
should
have
seen
how
moved
she
was
grave
yet
smiling
quite
sisterly
she
explained
her
position
to
me
saying
that
she
was
too
old
already
five
and
thirty
just
my
own
age
besides
she
added
her
girls
had
become
her
family
and
she
had
long
renounced
all
idea
of
living
for
herself
yet
i
fancy
that
my
proposal
stirred
up
some
old
regrets
briefly
we
continued
good
friends
and
i
decided
to
remain
a
bachelor
though
this
occasionally
embarrasses
me
at
le
moreux
on
account
of
my
girl
pupils
who
would
be
better
cared
for
by
a
woman
then
he
also
gave
some
good
news
of
the
state
of
feeling
in
his
parish
all
the
crass
ignorance
and
error
which
chagnat
had
voluntarily
allowed
to
accumulate
there
were
beginning
to
disappear
saleur
the
mayor
had
experienced
great
trouble
with
his
son
honoré
whom
he
had
sent
to
the
lycée
of
beaumont
where
he
had
been
stuffed
by
the
chaplain
with
as
much
religious
knowledge
as
he
would
have
acquired
in
a
seminary
in
such
wise
that
after
being
appointed
to
the
management
of
a
little
catholic
bank
in
paris
he
had
come
to
grief
there
by
practices
which
had
nearly
landed
him
in
a
criminal
court
since
then
his
father
the
who
at
heart
had
never
liked
the
priests
never
wearied
of
denouncing
what
he
called
the
black
band
exasperated
as
he
was
by
the
downfall
of
his
son
which
had
quite
upset
his
comfortable
life
as
an
enriched
peasant
and
thus
at
each
fresh
quarrel
with
abbé
cognasse
he
sided
with
schoolmaster
mignot
carrying
the
parish
council
with
him
and
threatening
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
the
church
if
the
priest
should
still
treat
the
inhabitants
as
a
subjugated
flock
indeed
never
before
had
that
lonely
sluggish
village
of
le
moreux
so
freely
granted
admittance
to
the
new
ideas
in
part
this
was
due
to
the
better
position
which
the
schoolmasters
had
secured
of
recent
years
various
laws
had
been
passed
improving
their
circumstances
and
the
lowest
annual
salaries
were
now
fixed
at
twelve
hundred
francs
without
any
deductions
it
had
not
been
necessary
to
wait
long
for
the
result
of
this
change
if
férou
ragged
and
wretched
had
formerly
incurred
the
contempt
of
the
peasantry
on
being
compared
by
them
with
abbé
cognasse
who
waxed
fat
on
and
presents
and
was
therefore
honoured
and
feared
mignot
on
the
contrary
being
able
to
live
in
a
dignified
way
had
risen
to
his
proper
position
that
is
the
first
indeed
in
that
struggle
between
the
church
and
the
school
the
whole
region
was
now
favouring
the
latter
whose
victory
appeared
to
be
certain
footnote
it
is
true
that
such
laws
have
been
passed
but
in
various
respects
they
are
merely
of
a
permissive
character
and
the
financial
circumstances
of
the
french
government
have
hitherto
prevented
the
realisation
of
provisions
favoured
by
the
legislature
several
publications
issued
in
the
autumn
of
since
death
have
shown
this
to
be
the
case
zola
however
in
this
last
section
of
anticipates
rather
than
follows
events
as
will
plainly
appear
in
the
final
chapters
and
as
a
strong
movement
in
favour
of
the
secular
schoolmasters
is
now
following
the
suppression
of
the
congregational
schools
considerable
improvement
in
the
position
will
probably
take
place
before
peasants
are
still
very
ignorant
mignot
continued
can
not
imagine
what
a
sluggish
spot
le
moreux
is
all
numbness
and
routine
the
peasants
have
lands
of
their
own
they
have
never
lacked
bread
and
they
would
submit
to
be
fleeced
as
in
former
times
rather
than
turn
to
anything
novel
and
strange
but
there
is
some
change
all
the
same
i
can
see
it
by
the
way
they
take
off
their
hats
to
me
and
the
more
and
more
preponderating
position
which
the
school
assumes
in
their
estimation
and
by
the
way
this
morning
when
abbé
cognasse
came
over
to
say
mass
there
were
just
three
women
and
a
boy
in
the
church
when
the
abbé
went
off
he
banged
the
vestry
door
behind
him
threatening
that
he
would
come
back
any
more
as
it
was
useless
for
him
to
walk
all
that
distance
for
nobody
marc
began
to
laugh
said
he
heard
that
the
abbé
is
getting
surly
again
at
le
moreux
here
he
still
restrains
himself
and
strives
to
win
the
battle
by
diplomatic
artfulness
particularly
with
the
women
for
his
superiors
have
taught
him
no
doubt
that
one
is
never
beaten
so
long
as
one
has
the
women
on
one
side
i
have
been
told
that
he
frequently
goes
to
valmarie
to
see
father
crabot
and
it
is
surely
there
that
he
acquires
that
unctuous
caressing
way
with
the
ladies
which
surprises
one
so
much
in
a
rough
brutal
man
of
his
stamp
when
he
again
loses
his
temper
as
he
will
some
day
it
will
be
all
over
besides
things
are
quite
satisfactory
at
jonville
we
gain
a
little
ground
every
year
the
parish
is
regaining
prosperity
and
health
in
consequence
of
the
recent
scandals
the
peasants
no
longer
allow
their
daughters
to
work
at
the
factory
of
the
good
shepherd
and
it
seems
that
the
parish
council
martineau
at
the
head
of
it
greatly
regrets
its
imbecility
in
having
allowed
abbé
cognasse
and
jauffre
to
dedicate
jonville
to
the
sacred
heart
i
am
on
the
lookout
for
an
opportunity
to
efface
that
remembrance
and
i
shall
end
by
finding
one
there
came
a
short
pause
then
salvan
who
had
listened
complacently
said
by
way
of
conclusion
in
his
quiet
cheerful
manner
that
is
very
encouraging

jonville
and
le
moreux
are
advancing
towards
those
better
times
for
which
we
have
battled
the
others
thought
they
would
conquer
us
exterminate
us
for
ever
and
indeed
for
months
it
seemed
as
if
we
were
dead
but
now
comes
the
slow
awakening
the
seed
has
germinated
in
the
ground
it
was
sufficient
for
us
to
resume
our
work
in
silence
and
the
good
grain
grows
and
flowers
once
more
and
now
nothing
will
hinder
the
future
harvest
the
fact
is
that
we
have
been
on
the
side
of
truth
which
nothing
can
destroy
nothing
arrest
in
its
splendour
no
doubt
things
are
not
quite
satisfactory
at
beaumont
the
sons
of
doutrequin
that
old
republican
of
the
heroic
times
who
lapsed
into
clericalism
have
obtained
advancement
and
mademoiselle
rouzaire
still
gorges
her
girls
with
bible
history
and
catechism
but
even
public
feeling
at
beaumont
is
beginning
to
change
moreover
mauraisin
has
not
succeeded
at
the
training
college
some
of
the
students
have
told
me
jocularly
that
my
ghost
appears
to
him
there
and
paralyses
him
with
fear
the
fact
is
that
the
impulse
had
been
given
and
he
has
found
it
impossible
to
stop
the
emancipation
of
the
schoolmaster
i
even
hope
that
we
shall
soon
be
rid
of
him
and
a
very
hopeful
symptom
is
that
behind
maillebois
jonville
and
le
moreux
there
are
other
small
towns
and
villages
nearly
all
in
fact
where
the
schoolmaster
is
defeating
the
priest
and
setting
the
secular
school
erect
on
the
ruins
of
the
congregational
school
reason
is
triumphing
and
justice
and
truth
are
slowly
increasing
their
sphere
of
conquest
at
dherbecourt
juilleroy
rouville
and
les
bordes
it
is
a
general
awakening
an
irresistible
movement
carrying
france
towards
her
liberating
mission
it
is
your
work
cried
marc
with
sudden
enthusiasm
is
a
pupil
of
yours
in
each
of
the
localities
you
have
named
they
are
the
children
of
your
heart
and
mind
it
was
you
who
sent
them
as
missionaries
into
lonely
country
districts
to
diffuse
the
new
gospel
of
truth
and
justice
if
people
are
at
last
awaking
returning
to
manly
dignity
becoming
an
equitable
free
and
healthy
democracy
it
is
because
a
generation
of
your
pupils
is
now
installed
in
our
classrooms
instructing
the
young
and
making
true
citizens
of
them
you
are
the
good
workman
you
realised
that
no
progress
is
possible
save
by
reason
and
knowledge
then
joulic
and
mignot
seconded
marc
with
similar
enthusiasm
yes
you
have
been
the
father
we
are
your
children
the
country
will
only
be
worth
what
the
schoolmasters
may
make
it
and
the
schoolmasters
themselves
can
only
be
worth
what
the
training
colleges
have
made
them
salvan
who
seemed
very
moved
protested
with
modest
like
me
my
friends
why
there
are
some
everywhere
there
will
be
plenty
when
they
are
allowed
to
act
le
barazer
helped
me
a
great
deal
by
keeping
me
at
my
post
and
not
tying
me
down
too
much
what
i
did
why
mauraisin
himself
is
almost
obliged
to
do
the
same
for
the
evolution
carries
him
on
the
work
once
begun
never
stops
and
you
see
mauraisin
successor
will
turn
out
even
better
masters
than
those
who
passed
through
my
hands
one
thing
which
delights
me
and
which
you
have
not
mentioned
is
that
nowadays
students
are
recruited
much
more
easily
for
the
training
colleges
what
made
me
most
anxious
in
former
times
was
the
distrust
the
contempt
into
which
the
teaching
profession
had
fallen
unhonoured
as
it
was
but
since
the
salaries
have
been
increased
now
that
real
honour
attaches
to
the
humblest
members
of
the
profession
candidates
arrive
from
all
quarters
so
that
one
is
able
to
pick
and
choose
and
form
an
excellent
staff
and
if
i
have
rendered
any
services
you
may
be
sure
that
on
seeing
my
work
continued
and
fulfilled
i
feel
rewarded
beyond
all
my
hopes
at
present
i
desire
to
remain
a
mere
spectator
of
things
i
applaud
your
efforts
and
live
happily
in
my
little
garden
delighted
to
be
forgotten
by
everybody
excepting
you
my
lads
he
ceased
speaking
and
a
thrill
of
feeling
passed
through
the
others
as
they
sat
there
at
the
large
stone
table
in
the
arbour
balmy
with
the
perfume
of
the
roses
while
from
the
verdant
garden
from
the
whole
stretch
of
country
around
them
infinite
serenity
was
wafted
every
year
since
her
parents
had
removed
to
jonville
louise
had
spent
the
vacation
with
them
her
brother
clément
would
now
soon
be
ten
years
old
and
marc
still
kept
him
in
his
school
giving
him
that
elementary
education
which
he
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
generalised
applied
to
all
the
children
of
the
nation
to
whatever
class
they
might
belong
in
order
that
one
might
have
based
upon
it
in
accordance
with
the
tastes
and
talents
of
the
pupils
a
system
of
general
and
gratuitous
secondary
education
if
his
own
tastes
should
be
shared
by
his
son
he
intended
to
prepare
him
for
the
training
college
of
beaumont
for
the
great
national
work
of
salvation
would
lie
in
the
humble
village
schools
for
many
years
longer
louise
also
had
disinterestedly
set
her
ambition
upon
becoming
an
elementary
teacher
and
indeed
on
quitting
the
school
of
fontenay
with
the
necessary
certificates
she
was
to
her
great
delight
appointed
assistant
to
her
former
and
mistress
mademoiselle
mazeline
at
maillebois
at
that
time
louise
was
nineteen
years
of
age
salvan
had
intervened
with
le
barazer
to
secure
her
appointment
which
passed
virtually
unnoticed
the
times
were
changing
more
and
more
the
period
of
delirium
when
the
mere
names
of
simon
and
froment
had
sufficed
to
raise
a
tempest
was
quite
over
and
this
emboldened
le
barazer
six
months
later
to
appoint
simon
son
joseph
as
assistant
to
joulic
joseph
it
should
be
said
had
made
his
at
dherbecourt
after
quitting
the
training
college
two
years
previously
with
an
excellent
record
as
advancement
his
transfer
to
maillebois
was
of
little
account
but
it
was
a
somewhat
bold
action
to
place
him
in
a
school
where
his
presence
implied
at
least
some
preliminary
rehabilitation
of
his
father
for
a
moment
there
was
a
slight
outcry
the
congregations
tried
to
stir
up
the
parents
of
the
town
but
the
new
assistant
soon
won
their
favour
for
he
behaved
very
discreetly
gently
yet
firmly
in
all
his
intercourse
with
the
children
one
incident
which
at
that
time
plainly
indicated
the
change
in
public
opinion
was
the
little
revolution
that
took
place
at
the
stationery
shop
one
day
madame
edouard
so
long
the
absolute
mistress
of
the
establishment
disappeared
into
the
back
shop
where
madame
alexandre
had
remained
so
many
years
and
madame
alexandre
took
her
place
at
the
counter
and
served
the
customers
nobody
mistook
the
meaning
of
that
revolution
the
customers
were
changing
the
secular
school
was
triumphing
over
its
congregational
rival
and
thus
in
the
interests
of
the
business
madame
edouard
like
a
good
trader
made
way
for
her
it
must
be
said
too
that
madame
edouard
now
had
some
great
worries
with
her
son
victor
who
entering
the
army
after
his
departure
from
the
brothers
school
and
reaching
the
rank
of
sergeant
had
lately
been
compromised
in
a
very
unpleasant
affair
whereas
madame
alexandre
had
every
right
to
be
proud
of
her
son
sébastien
who
had
been
one
of
simon
and
marc
best
pupils
then
joseph
companion
at
the
training
college
and
was
now
for
three
years
past
at
rouville
indeed
all
those
young
folk
sébastien
joseph
and
louise
after
growing
up
together
had
at
last
reached
active
life
bringing
with
them
broad
minds
ripened
early
in
the
midst
of
tears
to
continue
the
work
of
their
elders
a
year
went
by
louise
was
now
twenty
and
repairing
to
jonville
every
sunday
spent
the
day
with
her
parents
she
then
often
met
joseph
and
sébastien
who
had
remained
great
friends
and
were
very
fond
of
visiting
their
former
masters
marc
and
salvan
it
also
frequently
happened
that
joseph
was
accompanied
by
his
sister
sarah
who
was
well
pleased
to
spend
a
day
in
the
open
air
among
her
best
friends
for
three
years
past
she
had
been
residing
with
her
grandparents
the
lehmanns
displaying
so
much
activity
and
skill
that
a
little
prosperity
had
returned
to
the
dismal
shop
in
the
rue
du
trou
customers
had
returned
to
it
and
sarah
retaining
the
connection
formed
with
some
of
the
large
paris
clothiers
had
recruited
several
work
girls
and
banded
them
together
in
a
kind
of
group
madame
lehmann
had
lately
died
however
and
her
husband
now
years
old
lingered
on
with
only
one
regret
which
was
that
his
age
deprived
him
of
all
hope
of
ever
witnessing
rehabilitation
every
year
he
spent
a
week
or
two
with
simon
david
and
rachel
among
the
pyrenees
and
returned
home
well
pleased
to
have
found
them
working
quietly
in
their
lonely
retreat
but
also
very
sad
when
he
realized
that
they
would
know
no
real
happiness
as
long
as
the
monstrous
proceedings
of
rozan
should
remain
unrevised
sarah
had
tried
to
induce
the
old
man
to
stay
with
the
others
in
the
south
but
he
obstinately
returned
to
the
rue
du
trou
under
the
pretence
of
making
himself
useful
there
by
superintending
the
workroom
and
as
it
happened
this
circumstance
enabled
the
girl
to
take
an
occasional
holiday
when
on
accompanying
her
brother
joseph
to
jonville
she
chanced
to
feel
somewhat
tired
the
reunion
of
the
young
people
at
jonville
the
days
they
spent
there
so
gaily
brought
about
the
marriages
at
first
it
was
a
question
of
sébastien
marrying
sarah
which
surprised
nobody
though
it
was
regarded
as
an
indication
of
the
changing
times
that
young
milhomme
should
marry
simon
daughter
not
only
with
the
consent
of
his
mother
but
also
with
the
approval
of
madame
edouard
his
aunt
a
little
later
when
the
wedding
was
postponed
for
a
few
months
in
order
that
it
might
coincide
with
that
of
louise
and
joseph
a
little
excitement
arose
at
maillebois
for
this
time
the
proposed
union
was
one
between
the
condemned
man
son
and
the
daughter
of
his
most
valiant
defender
but
the
idyl
of
their
love
which
was
the
outcome
of
the
old
bitter
battle
and
all
the
heroism
that
had
been
displayed
in
it
touched
many
a
heart
and
even
tended
to
pacify
the
onlookers
though
all
were
curious
to
learn
how
louise
marriage
would
be
regarded
by
her
madame
duparque
who
for
three
years
past
had
not
quitted
her
little
house
on
the
place
des
capucins
and
indeed
the
marriage
was
postponed
for
another
month
in
order
that
madame
duparque
might
come
to
some
decision
respecting
it
though
louise
was
now
twenty
years
old
she
had
not
made
her
first
communion
and
it
had
been
settled
that
only
the
civil
ceremony
should
be
performed
at
her
wedding
with
joseph
as
at
that
of
sébastien
with
sarah
anxious
as
she
was
for
an
interview
with
madame
duparque
the
girl
wrote
her
an
entreating
letter
but
all
in
vain
for
she
did
not
even
receive
an
answer
the
old
lady
door
had
not
been
opened
to
geneviève
and
her
children
since
they
had
returned
to
marc
for
nearly
five
years
now
the
had
clung
to
her
fierce
oath
that
she
would
cast
off
all
her
relatives
and
live
cloistered
alone
with
god
geneviève
touched
by
the
thought
of
that
woman
of
fourscore
years
leading
in
solitude
a
life
of
gloom
and
silence
had
made
a
few
attempts
at
a
but
they
had
been
savagely
obstinately
repulsed
nevertheless
louise
desired
to
make
a
last
attempt
distressed
as
she
was
at
not
having
the
approval
of
all
her
kinsfolk
in
her
happiness
one
evening
then
at
sunset
she
repaired
to
the
little
house
which
was
already
steeped
in
the
dimness
of
twilight
but
to
her
astonishment
on
pulling
the
she
heard
no
sound
it
seemed
as
if
somebody
had
cut
the
wire
gathering
courage
she
then
ventured
to
knock
at
first
lightly
and
then
loudly
and
at
last
she
heard
a
slight
noise
the
board
of
a
little
judas
cut
in
the
door
as
in
the
door
of
a
convent
having
been
pulled
aside
it
you
pélagie
louise
inquired
it
you
answer
me
it
was
only
with
difficulty
after
placing
her
ear
close
to
the
judas
that
she
at
last
heard
the
servant
deadened
and
almost
unrecognisable
voice
away
go
away
pélagie
answered
says
that
you
are
to
go
away
at
once
no
pélagie
i
wo
go
away
louise
promptly
retorted
back
and
tell
grandmother
that
i
shall
not
leave
the
door
until
she
has
come
and
answered
me
herself
the
girl
remained
waiting
for
ten
minutes
or
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
hour
from
time
to
time
she
knocked
again
not
angrily
but
with
respectful
solicitous
persistence
and
all
at
once
the
judas
was
but
this
time
in
a
tempestuous
fashion
and
a
rough
subterranean
voice
called
to
her
have
you
come
here
for
you
wrote
to
me
about
a
fresh
abomination
a
marriage
the
very
shame
of
which
might
well
suffice
to
kill
me
what
is
the
use
of
speaking
of
it
are
you
even
fit
to
marry
have
you
made
your
first
communion
no
eh
you
amused
yourself
with
me
you
were
to
have
made
it
when
you
were
twenty
years
old
but
no
doubt
you
have
decided
that
you
will
never
do
so
so
it
is
useless
for
you
to
come
here
be
off
i
tell
you
i
am
dead
to
you
louise
quite
upset
shuddering
as
if
she
had
felt
an
icy
breath
from
the
grave
sweeping
across
her
cheek
had
barely
time
to
cry
i
will
wait
a
little
longer
i
will
come
back
in
a
month
time
then
the
judas
was
shut
violently
and
the
little
dim
and
silent
house
became
quite
deathly
in
the
darkness
which
had
now
gathered
all
around
during
the
previous
five
years
madame
duparque
had
gradually
relinquished
all
intercourse
with
the
world
at
first
on
the
morrow
of
madame
berthereau
death
and
geneviève
departure
she
had
contented
herself
with
ceasing
to
receive
her
relations
restricting
herself
to
the
society
of
a
few
pious
friends
of
her
own
sex
and
of
the
priests
and
other
clerics
whom
she
had
made
her
familiars
among
these
was
abbé
coquard
who
had
succeeded
abbé
quandieu
at
martin
he
was
a
rigid
man
full
of
a
sombre
faith
and
it
delighted
madame
duparque
to
hear
the
threats
which
he
addressed
to
the
wicked
threats
of
hell
with
its
consuming
flames
its
red
forks
and
its
boiling
oil
thus
morning
and
evening
she
was
seen
repairing
now
to
the
parish
church
now
to
the
capuchin
chapel
in
order
to
attend
the
various
offices
and
ceremonies
but
as
time
went
by
she
went
out
less
and
less
and
at
last
a
day
came
when
she
ceased
to
cross
her
threshold
it
was
as
if
she
were
gradually
sinking
into
gloom
and
silence
burying
herself
by
slow
degrees
one
day
even
the
shutters
of
her
house
which
had
still
been
opened
every
morning
and
closed
at
night
remained
closed
the
façade
becoming
blind
as
it
were
the
house
dead
neither
a
glimmer
nor
a
breath
of
life
emanating
from
it
any
more
one
might
have
thought
that
it
was
abandoned
uninhabited
if
sundry
frocks
and
gowns
had
not
been
seen
slipping
through
the
doorway
at
nightfall
they
were
the
gowns
of
abbé
coquard
father
théodose
and
at
times
so
people
said
father
crabot
who
thus
paid
the
old
lady
friendly
visits
her
little
fortune
now
a
matter
of
two
or
three
thousand
francs
a
year
which
she
had
arranged
to
leave
one
half
to
the
college
of
valmarie
the
other
to
the
capuchin
chapel
hardly
sufficed
to
explain
the
fidelity
of
her
clerical
friends
their
visits
must
also
have
been
due
in
part
to
her
exacting
and
despotic
nature
which
overcame
the
most
powerful
and
in
part
to
their
apprehensions
of
some
deed
of
mystical
madness
of
which
they
knew
her
to
be
capable
it
was
said
too
that
she
had
obtained
an
authorisation
to
hear
mass
and
take
the
communion
at
home
and
this
no
doubt
explained
why
she
no
longer
set
foot
out
of
doors
by
the
force
of
her
piety
she
had
compelled
even
the
deity
to
come
to
her
house
in
order
that
she
might
be
spared
the
affliction
of
going
to
his
for
the
idea
of
seeing
the
streets
and
the
people
in
them
of
again
setting
her
eyes
on
that
abominable
age
in
which
holy
church
was
agonising
had
become
such
torture
to
her
that
she
had
caused
her
shutters
to
be
nailed
in
position
and
every
chink
in
the
woodwork
to
be
stopped
up
in
order
that
no
sound
or
gleam
of
the
world
might
again
reach
her
this
was
the
supreme
crisis
she
spent
her
days
in
prayer
she
was
not
content
with
having
broken
off
all
intercourse
with
her
impious
and
accursed
relations
she
asked
herself
if
her
own
salvation
were
not
in
danger
through
having
incurred
perhaps
some
responsibility
in
the
damnation
of
her
kinsfolk
she
was
haunted
by
a
recollection
of
madame
berthereau
sacrilegious
revolt
on
her
and
believed
that
unhappy
woman
to
be
not
merely
in
purgatory
but
in
hell
then
too
came
the
thought
of
geneviève
whom
the
demon
had
assailed
so
terribly
and
who
had
gone
back
to
her
errors
like
a
dog
to
his
vomit
and
finally
there
was
louise
the
pagan
the
godless
creature
who
had
rejected
even
the
gift
of
the
divine
body
of
jesus
those
two
geneviève
and
louise
belonged
both
in
body
and
in
spirit
to
the
devil
and
if
madame
duparque
caused
masses
to
be
said
and
candles
burnt
for
the
repose
of
her
dead
daughter
soul
she
had
abandoned
those
who
still
lived
to
the
just
wrath
of
her
god
of
anger
and
punishment
but
at
the
same
time
her
anguish
remained
extreme
she
wondered
why
heaven
had
thus
stricken
her
in
her
posterity
and
strove
to
interpret
this
visitation
as
a
terrible
trial
whence
her
own
holiness
would
emerge
dazzling
and
triumphant
the
confined
claustral
life
she
led
entirely
devoted
to
religious
practices
seemed
to
her
to
be
necessary
reparation
for
which
she
would
be
rewarded
by
an
eternity
of
delight
in
this
wise
she
expiated
the
monstrous
sinfulness
of
her
descendants
those
women
guilty
of
free
thought
who
in
three
generations
had
escaped
from
the
church
and
ended
madly
by
putting
their
belief
in
a
religion
of
human
solidarity
thus
wishing
to
redeem
the
apostasy
of
her
grandchildren
madame
duparque
set
all
her
pride
in
humbling
herself
in
living
for
god
alone
in
seeking
to
slay
what
little
womanliness
still
lingered
in
her
for
it
was
from
that
womanliness
that
her
condemned
descendants
had
sprung
so
stern
and
sombre
was
her
ardour
that
she
wearied
the
few
clerics
who
alone
now
linked
her
to
the
world
she
was
conscious
of
the
decline
of
the
church
she
could
detect
the
collapse
of
catholicism
under
the
efforts
of
those
diabolical
times
from
which
she
had
withdrawn
by
way
of
protest
against
satan
victory
as
if
indeed
she
denied
that
victory
by
not
beholding
it
and
in
her
opinion
her
renunciation
her
fancied
martyrdom
might
perhaps
impart
new
vigour
to
the
soldiers
of
religion
she
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
them
as
ardent
as
resolute
as
fierce
as
she
herself
was
encasing
themselves
in
the
rigidity
of
dogmas
carrying
fire
and
sword
into
the
midst
of
the
unbelievers
and
aiding
the
great
exterminator
to
conquer
his
people
by
dint
of
thunderbolts
she
never
felt
satisfied
she
found
father
crabot
father
théodose
even
the
sombre
abbé
coquard
altogether
too
lukewarm
she
accused
them
of
compounding
with
the
hateful
worldly
spirit
of
the
times
and
of
completing
the
ruin
of
the
church
with
their
own
hands
by
adapting
religion
to
the
tastes
of
the
day
she
dictated
their
duty
to
them
preached
a
campaign
of
frankness
and
violence
unhinged
as
she
was
thrown
into
extreme
exaltation
by
her
lonely
life
and
ever
athirst
with
some
supreme
longings
in
spite
of
all
the
penitence
heaped
upon
her
father
crabot
was
the
first
to
grow
tired
of
that
strange
penitent
who
at
years
of
age
treated
herself
so
harshly
and
bore
herself
like
a
despairing
prophetess
whose
uncompromising
catholicism
was
really
a
condemnation
of
the
long
efforts
made
by
his
own
order
to
humanise
the
terrible
deity
of
the
stakes
and
the
massacres
thus
the
jesuit
allowed
long
intervals
to
elapse
between
his
discreet
visits
and
finally
he
altogether
ceased
to
call
being
of
opinion
no
doubt
that
the
legacy
he
had
hoped
to
receive
for
valmarie
would
not
be
sufficient
compensation
for
the
dangers
he
might
incur
with
a
woman
whose
soul
was
ever
in
a
tempest
a
few
months
later
abbé
coquard
likewise
withdrew
not
because
he
had
any
cowardly
fears
of
being
compromised
but
because
each
of
his
discussions
with
the
old
lady
degenerated
into
a
horrible
battle
eager
and
despotic
like
herself
the
abbé
was
bent
on
retaining
all
his
power
and
authority
as
a
priest
and
one
day
when
madame
duparque
began
to
thunder
in
the
name
of
god
reproaching
him
with
inaction
in
such
wise
that
he
appeared
to
be
a
mere
transgressing
sinner
he
became
quite
angry
for
he
declined
to
accept
such
a
reversal
of
their
respective
positions
then
for
nearly
another
year
only
father
théodose
frock
was
to
be
seen
slipping
into
the
little
silent
closed
house
of
the
place
des
capucins
father
théodose
no
doubt
regarded
madame
duparque
little
fortune
as
worth
taking
for
the
times
were
hard
with
poor
antony
of
padua
in
vain
did
the
capuchin
scatter
prospectuses
broadcast
money
did
not
now
flow
into
the
collection
boxes
as
it
had
done
in
the
happy
days
when
by
a
stroke
of
genius
he
had
induced
monseigneur
bergerot
to
bless
one
of
the
saint
bones
in
those
days
the
miracle
lottery
had
put
people
into
quite
a
fever
the
sick
the
idle
and
the
poor
had
all
dreamt
of
winning
happiness
from
heaven
in
return
for
an
investment
of
twenty
sous
whereas
now
that
a
little
sense
and
truth
were
spreading
through
the
district
thanks
to
the
secular
schools
the
base
commerce
of
the
capuchin
chapel
stood
revealed
in
all
its
shameful
imbecility
for
a
time
it
is
true
another
stroke
of
genius
on
the
part
of
father
théodose
the
creation
of
some
wonderful
mortgage
bonds
on
heaven
had
again
stirred
the
souls
of
the
humble
and
the
suffering
who
as
life
below
proved
so
cruel
to
them
hungered
for
felicity
beyond
the
grave
then
during
several
months
the
money
of
dupes
had
flowed
in
all
the
savings
hidden
in
old
stockings
had
been
brought
forth
by
believers
anxious
to
secure
the
chance
of
a
little
peace
in
the
unknown
but
finally
being
confronted
by
growing
incredulity
father
théodose
had
found
it
difficult
to
place
his
remaining
bonds
and
had
thereupon
planned
a
third
stroke
of
genius
this
time
the
invention
of
some
private
reserved
gardens
in
the
fields
of
the
blessed
according
to
him
there
were
to
be
some
delightful
little
nooks
in
eternity
garnished
with
roses
and
lilies
of
the
very
best
varieties
under
foliage
set
out
to
please
the
eyes
and
near
springs
which
would
be
particularly
pure
and
fresh
and
thanks
once
more
to
the
decisive
intervention
of
antony
of
padua
one
might
book
those
little
nooks
in
advance
thereby
ensuring
to
oneself
the
eternal
enjoyment
of
them
naturally
the
booking
was
very
expensive
if
one
desired
something
spacious
and
comfortable
though
there
were
indeed
gardens
at
all
prices
which
varied
in
accordance
with
site
charm
and
proximity
to
the
abodes
of
the
angels
two
old
ladies
it
appeared
had
already
bequeathed
their
fortunes
to
the
capuchins
in
order
that
the
saint
might
reserve
for
them
two
of
the
best
gardens
that
were
still
vacant
one
being
in
the
style
of
an
old
french
park
whereas
the
other
was
more
of
the
type
with
a
maze
and
a
waterfall
and
it
was
also
said
that
madame
duparque
had
in
a
like
way
made
her
choice
this
being
a
golden
grotto
on
the
slope
of
an
azure
mount
among
clumps
of
myrtle
bushes
and
oleanders
father
théodose
then
alone
continued
to
visit
the
old
lady
putting
up
with
her
fits
of
temper
and
returning
to
the
house
even
after
she
had
driven
him
from
it
in
exasperation
at
finding
him
so
lukewarm
and
resigned
to
the
triumph
of
the
church
enemies
and
the
capuchin
had
actually
ended
by
securing
a
in
order
that
he
might
enter
the
house
whenever
he
pleased
instead
of
having
to
ring
the
bell
again
and
again
for
poor
pélagie
had
become
extremely
deaf
it
was
also
at
this
same
moment
that
the
two
women
the
two
recluses
as
they
may
be
called
cut
the
bell
wire
for
of
what
use
was
it
to
retain
that
connecting
link
with
the
outer
world
the
only
living
being
whom
they
now
received
had
a
key
to
admit
himself
and
by
cutting
the
wire
they
were
spared
the
nervous
starts
that
came
upon
them
whenever
they
heard
that
jangling
bell
which
they
did
not
wish
to
answer
pélagie
indeed
had
become
as
fierce
and
as
maniacal
as
her
mistress
she
had
begun
by
curtailing
her
chats
in
the
tradespeople
shops
scarcely
speaking
to
anybody
when
she
went
out
but
gliding
swiftly
past
the
houses
like
a
shadow
next
she
had
decided
to
go
shopping
twice
a
week
only
in
this
wise
condemning
her
mistress
and
herself
to
live
on
stale
bread
and
a
few
vegetables
such
fare
as
might
have
suited
a
pair
of
hermits
in
the
desert
and
now
the
few
tradespeople
came
themselves
to
the
house
at
nightfall
on
saturday
evenings
and
left
their
goods
at
the
doorway
in
a
basket
which
they
found
waiting
for
them
on
the
ensuing
saturday
with
the
money
due
to
them
wrapped
in
a
scrap
of
newspaper
at
the
same
time
pélagie
had
one
great
worry
her
nephew
polydor
who
had
entered
a
beaumont
monastery
in
a
menial
capacity
and
who
came
and
made
frightful
scenes
with
her
whenever
he
wished
to
extort
money
he
alarmed
the
old
woman
to
such
a
degree
that
she
did
not
even
dare
to
leave
him
at
the
door
for
she
felt
sure
that
on
some
pretext
or
other
he
would
collect
a
crowd
and
force
his
way
in
and
when
she
had
admitted
him
she
trembled
still
more
for
she
knew
that
he
was
a
man
to
deal
her
a
nasty
blow
should
she
refuse
to
give
him
a
piece
for
many
long
years
she
had
caressed
the
dream
of
employing
all
her
savings
some
ten
thousand
francs
scraped
together
copper
by
copper
to
procure
some
happiness
in
the
other
world
and
if
the
little
treasure
was
still
carefully
hidden
away
inside
her
palliasse
this
was
because
she
hesitated
as
to
the
best
the
most
efficacious
mode
of
investment
should
she
found
a
perpetual
mass
for
the
repose
of
her
soul
or
should
she
book
one
of
father
théodose
reserved
gardens
a
modest
little
nook
in
heaven
by
the
side
of
her
mistress
lordly
grotto
and
she
was
still
hesitating
in
this
respect
when
misfortune
fell
upon
her
one
night
when
she
had
been
obliged
to
admit
polydor
the
rascal
did
not
murder
her
but
rushed
in
turn
upon
every
article
of
furniture
in
her
garret
finally
ripping
up
the
palliasse
and
fleeing
with
the
ten
thousand
francs
while
pélagie
whom
he
had
thrust
aside
and
who
had
fallen
beside
the
bed
groaned
with
despair
at
seeing
that
bandit
who
was
of
her
own
flesh
and
blood
make
off
with
the
blessed
money
which
antony
of
padua
was
to
have
given
her
back
in
eternal
delight
would
she
be
damned
then
as
she
no
longer
possessed
the
wherewithal
to
speculate
in
the
miraculous
lottery
such
was
the
shock
the
old
woman
experienced
that
two
days
later
she
died
and
it
was
father
théodose
who
found
her
already
stark
and
cold
in
her
bare
and
dirty
garret
to
which
he
climbed
in
his
surprise
and
anxiety
at
discovering
her
nowhere
else
he
was
obliged
to
attend
to
everything
declare
the
death
make
arrangements
for
the
funeral
and
busy
himself
as
to
how
the
last
remaining
inmate
of
the
little
house
would
live
now
that
she
had
nobody
left
to
serve
her
for
several
weeks
past
madame
duparque
whose
legs
had
become
too
feeble
to
support
her
weight
had
taken
to
her
bed
in
which
however
she
remained
in
a
sitting
posture
erect
and
tall
though
withered
little
breath
was
left
her
yet
she
still
seemed
to
reign
despotically
over
that
silent
dark
and
empty
house
whence
she
had
driven
all
her
kith
and
kin
and
where
the
only
creature
the
domestic
animal
whom
she
had
been
willing
to
tolerate
had
just
died
when
father
théodose
on
returning
from
pélagie
funeral
tried
to
ascertain
madame
duparque
intentions
with
respect
to
her
future
mode
of
life
he
could
not
even
extract
an
answer
from
her
greatly
embarrassed
he
insisted
and
offered
to
send
her
a
sister
pointing
out
that
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
attend
to
any
household
duties
as
she
could
not
even
leave
her
bed
but
she
at
once
flew
into
a
temper
growled
like
some
mighty
animal
stricken
unto
death
and
unwilling
to
be
disturbed
in
its
final
hour
vague
charges
gurgled
in
her
throat
they
were
all
cowards
all
traitors
to
their
god
all
egotists
who
abandoned
the
church
in
order
that
the
vaults
might
not
fall
upon
their
heads
thereupon
father
théodose
in
his
turn
growing
exasperated
left
her
deciding
that
he
would
return
the
following
morning
to
see
if
she
had
become
more
reasonable
a
night
and
a
day
elapsed
for
the
superior
of
the
capuchins
was
only
able
to
return
at
dusk
four
and
twenty
hours
later
during
that
night
and
day
then
madame
duparque
remained
alone
absolutely
alone
behind
the
nailed
shutters
the
carefully
closed
doors
and
windows
of
her
dark
room
where
neither
a
sound
nor
a
ray
of
light
from
the
outer
world
penetrated
she
herself
had
willed
it
thus
severing
all
carnal
ties
with
her
relations
withdrawing
from
the
world
in
protest
against
the
hateful
society
of
the
times
in
which
sin
had
proved
triumphant
and
after
giving
herself
wholly
to
the
church
she
had
gradually
become
disgusted
with
its
ministers
those
priests
who
lacked
all
militant
faith
those
monks
who
had
no
heroic
bravery
but
who
were
all
worldly
men
bent
on
personal
enjoyment
thus
she
had
dismissed
them
also
and
now
she
remained
alone
with
her
deity
an
implacable
and
stubborn
deity
who
ruled
with
absolute
exterminating
and
vengeful
power
all
light
and
all
life
had
departed
from
that
cold
dismal
and
house
where
there
only
remained
a
feeble
octogenarian
woman
sitting
up
in
bed
gazing
into
the
black
darkness
and
waiting
for
her
jealous
god
to
carry
her
away
in
order
that
lukewarm
souls
might
have
an
example
of
a
really
pious
end
and
when
father
théodose
presented
himself
at
the
house
at
dusk
he
found
to
his
intense
surprise
that
the
door
would
not
open
that
it
resisted
all
his
efforts
the
key
turned
readily
enough
in
the
lock
and
it
seemed
therefore
that
the
door
must
have
been
bolted
but
who
could
have
bolted
it
there
was
nobody
inside
except
the
ailing
woman
who
could
not
leave
her
bed
the
capuchin
then
made
fresh
attempts
but
in
vain
and
at
last
feeling
frightened
unwilling
to
incur
any
further
responsibility
he
hastened
to
the
town
hall
to
explain
the
matter
to
the
authorities
a
messenger
was
at
once
sent
to
mademoiselle
mazeline
for
louise
and
as
it
happened
marc
and
geneviève
were
there
having
come
over
from
jonville
as
the
news
of
pélagie
death
had
made
them
feel
anxious
a
tragical
business
followed
the
whole
family
repaired
to
the
place
des
capucins
as
the
door
would
not
yield
a
locksmith
was
sent
for
but
he
declared
he
could
do
nothing
for
assuredly
the
bolts
were
fastened
it
therefore
became
necessary
to
send
for
a
mason
who
with
his
pick
unsealed
the
door
hinges
set
in
the
stone
work
at
each
blow
the
silent
house
like
a
closed
vault
and
when
the
door
had
been
torn
down
it
was
with
a
quiver
that
marc
and
geneviève
followed
by
louise
that
family
abode
whence
they
had
been
banished
an
icy
dampness
reigned
there
it
was
only
with
difficulty
that
they
managed
to
light
a
candle
and
upstairs
in
the
bed
they
found
madame
duparque
still
in
a
sitting
posture
propped
up
by
pillows
but
quite
dead
with
a
large
crucifix
between
her
long
thin
shrivelled
hands
in
a
superhuman
effort
she
had
assuredly
found
the
supreme
energy
to
leave
her
bed
crawl
down
the
stairs
and
shoot
the
bolts
in
order
that
no
living
soul
not
even
a
priest
might
disturb
her
in
her
last
communion
with
god
and
then
she
had
crawled
upstairs
again
and
had
died
there
when
father
théodose
saw
her
he
fell
on
his
knees
shuddering
and
stammering
a
prayer
he
was
distraught
for
he
detected
in
that
death
not
merely
the
end
of
a
terrible
old
woman
raised
to
a
fierce
grandeur
as
it
were
by
her
uncompromising
faith
but
also
the
end
of
all
superstitious
and
mendacious
religion
and
marc
in
whose
arms
geneviève
and
louise
had
sought
a
refuge
seemed
to
feel
a
great
gust
sweeping
by
as
though
eternal
life
were
springing
from
that
death
when
the
family
after
leaving
the
funeral
arrangements
to
abbé
coquard
made
a
search
in
the
old
lady
drawers
they
found
nothing
neither
will
nor
securities
of
any
kind
it
could
not
be
said
that
father
théodose
had
purloined
any
property
for
he
had
not
returned
to
the
house
was
it
to
be
assumed
then
that
the
old
lady
had
previously
handed
her
securities
to
him
or
to
another
or
had
she
destroyed
them
unwilling
that
her
relatives
should
benefit
by
her
fortune
the
mystery
was
never
solved
not
a
copper
was
ever
found
only
the
little
house
remained
and
it
was
sold
the
proceeds
being
given
to
the
poor
at
the
request
of
geneviève
who
said
that
in
taking
that
course
she
was
certainly
doing
what
her
grandmother
would
have
desired
in
the
evening
after
returning
from
the
funeral
geneviève
cast
her
arms
round
her
husband
neck
and
made
him
a
frank
confession
you
only
knew
said
she
was
beset
again
when
i
heard
that
grandmother
was
all
alone
so
bravely
and
loftily
adhering
to
her
stubborn
faith
yes
i
asked
myself
if
my
place
were
not
beside
her
and
if
i
had
done
right
in
leaving
her
but
what
can
you
expect
dear
i
shall
never
be
quite
cured
in
the
depths
of
my
being
i
shall
always
retain
a
little
of
my
old
belief
yet
what
a
frightful
death
that
was
and
how
right
you
are
in
asking
that
people
should
live
as
they
ought
to
that
women
should
be
liberated
set
in
their
right
position
as
the
equals
and
companions
of
men
and
that
life
should
partake
of
all
that
is
good
and
true
and
just
a
month
later
the
two
weddings
at
last
took
place
louise
was
married
to
joseph
sarah
to
sébastien
and
in
those
espousals
marc
perceived
a
beginning
of
victory
the
good
crop
sown
with
so
much
difficulty
in
the
midst
of
persecution
and
outrage
was
germinating
and
growing
already
ii
years
went
by
and
marc
continued
his
work
sturdy
yet
at
sixty
years
of
age
and
as
passionately
attached
to
truth
and
justice
as
he
had
been
at
the
outset
of
the
great
struggle
and
one
day
when
he
happened
to
go
to
beaumont
to
call
on
delbos
the
latter
suddenly
said
to
him
the
way
my
dear
fellow
i
have
had
a
strange
encounter
the
other
evening
at
dusk
while
i
was
returning
home
i
noticed
a
man
of
about
your
age
looking
wretched
and
ravaged
walking
ahead
of
me
along
the
avenue
des
jaffres
and
all
at
once
in
the
blaze
of
light
coming
from
the
confectioner
shop
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
gambetta
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
recognised
our
gorgias
our
gorgias
yes
brother
gorgias
not
wearing
an
ignorantine
cassock
but
a
greasy
and
slipping
alongside
the
walls
with
the
suspicious
gait
of
an
emaciated
old
wolf
he
must
have
come
back
secretly
and
must
be
living
in
some
dark
nook
or
other
still
trying
to
frighten
and
exploit
his
old
accomplices
marc
whom
the
announcement
had
greatly
surprised
remained
full
of
doubt
must
have
been
mistaken
said
he
attaches
too
much
value
to
his
skin
to
return
to
beaumont
and
run
the
risk
of
being
sent
to
the
galleys
that
is
whenever
the
discovery
of
a
new
fact
may
enable
us
to
apply
for
the
quashing
of
the
rozan
judgment
is
you
who
are
mistaken
my
friend
delbos
answered
man
has
nothing
more
to
fear
according
to
our
law
of
limitation
there
can
be
no
public
action
in
a
criminal
matter
after
the
expiration
of
ten
years
and
so
even
nowadays
little
zéphirin
murderer
can
walk
the
streets
in
the
daylight
without
any
fear
of
arrest
however
i
may
have
been
deceived
by
a
mere
resemblance
and
in
any
case
the
return
of
gorgias
can
have
no
interest
for
us
for
you
agree
with
me
do
you
not
that
we
can
derive
nothing
useful
from
him
nothing
whatever
he
lied
so
much
at
the
time
of
the
affair
that
if
he
should
say
anything
now
he
would
certainly
lie
again
the
truth
can
never
come
to
us
from
him
in
this
wise
at
long
intervals
marc
called
upon
delbos
in
order
to
chat
with
him
about
that
everlasting
simon
case
which
after
the
lapse
of
so
many
years
still
remained
like
a
cancer
gnawing
at
the
heart
of
the
country
people
might
deny
its
existence
believe
it
to
be
dead
cease
to
speak
of
it
but
nevertheless
it
still
stealthily
prosecuted
its
ravages
like
some
secret
venom
poisoning
life
twice
a
year
david
quitted
his
lonely
retreat
in
the
pyrenees
and
came
to
beaumont
in
order
to
confer
with
delbos
and
marc
for
in
spite
of
the
pardon
granted
to
his
brother
he
had
not
for
an
hour
relinquished
his
hope
of
eventual
acquittal
and
rehabilitation
they
david
delbos
and
marc
were
convinced
that
the
monstrous
verdict
would
be
some
day
set
aside
and
that
the
affair
would
end
by
the
victory
of
the
innocent
but
even
as
in
previous
years
after
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
cassation
they
found
themselves
struggling
amidst
an
intricate
network
of
falsehoods
after
hesitating
for
a
time
as
to
which
scent
they
might
best
follow
they
had
decided
to
investigate
a
second
crime
committed
by
gragnon
a
crime
which
they
had
already
suspected
at
rozan
and
of
which
they
were
now
convinced
gragnon
at
the
time
of
the
rozan
proceedings
had
repeated
his
illegal
communication
trick
on
this
second
occasion
however
he
had
availed
himself
not
of
one
of
simon
letters
with
a
forged
postscript
and
paraph
but
of
a
confession
alleged
to
have
been
written
by
the
workman
who
was
said
to
have
made
a
false
stamp
for
the
maillebois
schoolmaster
this
confession
having
been
handed
it
was
alleged
to
one
of
the
nuns
of
the
beaumont
hospital
by
the
workman
in
question
when
he
was
near
his
death
assuredly
gragnon
had
walked
about
beaumont
with
that
confession
in
his
pocket
speaking
of
it
as
a
thunderbolt
which
he
would
hurl
at
the
simonists
if
they
drove
him
to
extremities
showing
it
also
or
causing
it
to
be
shown
to
certain
members
of
the
jury
those
who
were
pious
and
but
at
the
same
time
affecting
a
keen
desire
to
save
the
holy
nun
to
whom
the
confession
had
been
given
from
being
publicly
mixed
up
in
such
a
scandal
and
this
explained
everything
the
abominable
behaviour
of
the
jury
in
reconvicting
the
innocent
prisoner
became
excusable
those
men
of
average
intelligence
and
honesty
had
been
deceived
like
the
jurors
of
beaumont
and
had
yielded
to
motives
which
had
remained
secret
marc
and
david
well
remembered
that
they
had
heard
some
juryman
ask
certain
questions
which
had
then
seemed
to
them
ridiculous
but
they
now
understood
that
this
juryman
had
referred
to
the
terrible
document
which
gragnon
had
stealthily
hawked
about
and
of
which
it
was
not
prudent
to
speak
plainly
delbos
therefore
busied
himself
with
that
new
fact
that
second
criminal
communication
which
if
proved
would
entail
the
immediate
annulment
of
the
proceedings
at
rozan
but
unfortunately
nothing
could
be
more
difficult
to
prove
and
for
years
delbos
and
his
friends
had
striven
vainly
only
one
hope
remained
to
them
a
juror
a
retired
medical
man
named
beauchamp
had
acquired
a
certainty
that
the
workman
alleged
confession
was
simply
a
gross
forgery
in
a
measure
things
repeated
themselves
as
is
not
infrequently
the
case
in
real
life
beauchamp
being
assailed
by
remorse
like
his
predecessor
architect
jacquin
he
himself
it
is
true
was
not
a
clerical
but
he
had
an
extremely
devout
wife
and
did
not
wish
to
plunge
her
into
desolation
by
relieving
his
conscience
thus
it
was
necessary
to
wait
footnote
it
may
be
held
that
zola
has
perpetrated
an
artistic
blunder
by
introducing
into
his
narrative
a
repetition
so
to
say
of
the
jacquin
episode
but
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
simon
affair
is
based
on
the
dreyfus
case
in
which
there
were
several
repetitions
of
that
character
among
those
who
sat
in
judgment
on
dreyfus
esterhazy
and
picquart
there
were
repeated
instances
of
belated
conscientious
scruples
some
indeed
known
to
the
initiated
but
never
made
public
thus
if
zola
is
inartistic
in
making
two
characters
of
his
story
adopt
virtually
the
same
course
he
is
at
least
true
to
however
as
the
years
went
by
circumstances
became
more
favourable
thanks
to
the
spread
of
secular
education
the
social
evolution
was
being
hastened
and
giving
great
results
all
france
was
being
renewed
a
new
nation
was
coming
from
its
thousands
of
parish
schools
whose
influence
was
to
be
found
beneath
each
fresh
reform
that
was
effected
each
fresh
step
that
was
taken
toward
solidarity
and
peace
things
which
had
seemed
impossible
in
former
times
were
easily
accomplished
now
that
the
nation
was
delivered
from
error
and
falsehood
endowed
with
knowledge
and
force
of
will
thus
at
the
general
elections
which
took
place
in
may
that
year
delbos
at
last
defeated
lemarrois
who
had
been
mayor
of
beaumont
for
so
long
a
period
at
one
time
it
had
seemed
as
if
the
latter
would
never
lose
his
seat
personifying
as
he
did
the
great
mass
of
average
public
opinion
but
the
had
denied
its
revolutionary
past
and
allied
itself
with
the
church
in
order
that
it
might
not
have
to
abandon
any
of
its
usurped
power
it
clung
to
the
privileges
it
had
acquired
and
rather
than
share
its
royalty
or
its
wealth
with
the
masses
it
preferred
to
make
use
of
all
the
old
reactionary
forces
in
order
to
thrust
the
now
awakened
and
enlightened
people
into
servitude
once
more
lemarrois
was
a
typical
example
of
the
republican
who
wishing
to
defend
his
class
sank
into
a
kind
of
involuntary
reaction
and
was
therefore
condemned
and
swept
away
in
the
inevitable
of
that
which
a
hundred
years
of
trafficking
and
enjoyment
had
sufficed
to
rot
it
was
inevitable
that
the
people
should
ascend
to
power
as
soon
as
it
became
conscious
of
its
strength
of
the
inexhaustible
reserve
of
energy
intelligence
and
will
slumbering
within
it
and
it
was
sufficient
that
it
should
be
emancipated
roused
from
the
heavy
sleep
of
ignorance
by
the
schools
in
order
that
it
might
take
its
due
place
and
rejuvenate
the
nation
the
was
now
at
the
point
of
death
and
the
people
would
necessarily
become
the
great
liberating
france
of
and
there
was
so
to
say
an
annunciation
of
all
those
things
in
the
victory
achieved
at
beaumont
by
delbos
the
man
who
had
been
simon
counsel
who
had
been
denied
and
insulted
so
long
at
first
securing
only
a
few
socialist
votes
which
by
degrees
had
become
an
overwhelming
majority
another
proof
of
the
people
accession
to
power
was
to
be
found
in
the
complete
change
which
had
come
over
marcilly
he
had
formerly
figured
in
a
radical
ministry
then
after
the
reconviction
of
simon
he
had
entered
a
moderate
administration
and
now
he
affected
extreme
socialist
principles
and
by
harnessing
himself
to
delbos
triumphal
car
had
managed
to
get
it
is
true
that
the
popular
victory
was
not
complete
throughout
the
department
for
count
hector
de
sanglebœuf
had
also
been
this
time
as
an
uncompromising
reactionary
for
the
usual
phenomenon
of
troublous
times
had
appeared
only
plain
frank
extreme
opinions
finding
support
the
party
vanquished
for
ever
was
the
old
liberal
which
had
become
conservative
from
egotism
and
fright
and
which
lacking
all
strength
and
logic
was
ripe
for
its
fall
and
the
ascending
class
the
great
mass
of
those
who
only
the
day
before
had
been
called
the
disinherited
would
naturally
take
the
place
of
the
after
sweeping
away
the
few
stubborn
defenders
that
remained
to
the
church
but
the
election
of
delbos
was
particularly
notable
as
being
the
first
great
success
achieved
by
one
of
those
rascals
without
god
or
country
one
of
those
traitors
who
had
publicly
declared
simon
to
be
innocent
after
the
monstrous
proceedings
of
rozan
all
the
notable
simonists
had
suffered
in
their
persons
or
their
pockets
for
having
dared
to
desire
truth
and
justice
insult
persecution
summary
dismissal
had
been
heaped
upon
them
there
was
delbos
to
whom
no
client
had
dared
to
confide
his
interests
there
was
salvan
dismissed
compulsorily
retired
there
was
marc
disgraced
sent
to
a
little
village
and
behind
the
leaders
how
many
others
there
were
relations
and
friends
who
for
merely
behaving
in
an
upright
manner
were
assailed
with
worries
and
at
times
even
ruined
full
of
mute
grief
at
the
sight
of
such
aberration
well
understanding
that
all
rebellion
was
useless
the
friends
of
truth
had
simply
turned
to
their
work
awaiting
the
inevitable
hour
when
reason
and
equity
would
triumph
and
that
hour
seemed
to
be
approaching
for
now
delbos
one
of
the
most
deeply
involved
in
the
affair
had
defeated
lemarrois
who
had
long
pursued
a
pusillanimous
policy
refusing
to
take
sides
either
for
or
against
simon
was
not
this
a
proof
that
opinion
had
changed
that
a
great
advance
had
been
effected
moreover
salvan
secured
consolation
for
one
of
his
old
pupils
was
appointed
to
the
directorship
of
the
training
college
after
mauraisin
had
been
virtually
dismissed
for
incapacity
great
was
the
delight
of
the
sage
when
those
tidings
reached
him
not
because
it
pleased
him
to
crow
over
his
vanquished
adversary
but
because
he
at
last
saw
the
continuation
of
his
work
entrusted
to
one
who
was
brave
and
faithful
and
finally
a
day
came
when
le
barazer
who
now
felt
strong
enough
to
repair
former
injustice
sent
for
marc
and
offered
him
the
head
mastership
of
a
school
at
beaumont
such
an
offer
on
the
part
of
that
prudent
diplomatist
the
academy
inspector
was
extremely
significant
and
marc
was
pleased
indeed
nevertheless
he
declined
it
for
he
did
not
wish
to
leave
jonville
where
his
task
was
not
yet
finished
there
were
also
other
precursory
signs
of
the
great
impending
change
in
the
country
prefect
hennebise
had
been
replaced
by
a
very
energetic
and
sensible
functionary
who
had
immediately
demanded
the
revocation
of
depinvilliers
under
whose
management
the
lycée
of
beaumont
had
become
a
kind
of
seminary
rector
forbes
had
been
compelled
to
rouse
himself
from
the
study
of
ancient
history
in

his

owned

house
there
he
was
exasperated
with
the

spirit
which
reigned
in
the
town
and
did
not
wish
to
come
into
contact
with
his
successor

republican
general
whom
some
people
even
declared
to
be
a
socialist
moreover
magistrate
daix
had
met
a
wretched
death
haunted
as
he
was
by
spectres
in
spite
of
his
belated
confession
at
rozan
while
the
former
procureur
de

république
raoul
de

after
having
a
fine
career
in

seemed
likely
to
come
to
grief
there
amidst
the
collapse
of
a
colossal
swindle
which
he
had
in
some
way
befriended

as
a
last
and
excellent
symptom
of
the
times
nobody
now
saluted
gragnon
the
judge
when
thin
and
yellow
he
anxiously
threaded
the
avenue
des
jaffres
hanging
his
head
but
glancing
nervously
to

left
as
if
he
feared
that
somebody

spit
upon
him

he
passed
footnote
all
newspaper
readers
know
that
various
judicial
personages
have
been
compromised
in
recent
french
the
happy
effects
of
free
and
secular
education
which
brought
light
and
health
in
its
train
were
also
manifest
at
maillebois
whither
marc
often
repaired
to
see
his
daughter
louise
who
with
joseph
her
husband
lived
in
the
little
lodging
which
mignot
had
so
long
occupied
at
the
communal
school
maillebois
indeed
was
no
longer
that
intensely
clerical
little
town
where
the
congregations
had
succeeded
in
raising
their
creature
philis
to
the
mayoralty
in
former
times
the
eight
hundred
working
men
of
the
being
divided
among
themselves
could
return
only
a
few
republicans
to
the
municipal
council
in
which
they
were
reduced
to
inaction
but
at
the
recent
elections
the
whole
republican
and
socialist
list
had
passed
by
a
large
majority
in
such
wise
that
darras
defeating
his
rival
philis
had
now
again
become
mayor
and
his
delight
at
returning
to
that
office
whence
the
priests
had
driven
him
was
the
keener
as
he
was
now
supported
by
a
compact
majority
which
would
enable
him
to
act
frankly
instead
of
being
continually
reduced
to
compromises
marc
met
darras
one
day
and
found
him
quite
radiant
i
remember
said
he
did
not
think
me
very
brave
in
former
times
that
poor
simon
i
was
convinced
of
his
innocence
yet
i
refused
to
act
when
you
came
to
me
at
the
municipal
offices
but
how
could
i
help
it
i
had
a
bare
majority
of
two
the
council
constantly
escaped
my
control
and
the
proof
is
that
it
ended
by
overthrowing
me
ah
if
i
had
then
only
had
the
majority
we
now
possess
we
are
the
masters
at
last
and
things
will
move
quickly
i
promise
you
marc
smiled
and
asked
him
what
had
become
of
philis
his
defeated
adversary
oh
he
has
been
greatly
tried
a
certain
person
you
know
whom
i
mean
died
recently
and
so
he
has
had
to
resign
himself
to
living
alone
with
his
daughter
octavie
a
very
pious
young
woman
who
does
not
care
to
marry
his
son
raymond
being
a
naval
officer
is
always
far
away
and
the
house
can
not
be
very
cheerful
unless
indeed
philis
is
already
seeking
consolation
which
may
be
the
case
for
i
saw
a
new
servant
there
the
other
day
yes
quite
a
sturdy
girl
darras
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
for
his
own
part
having
retired
from
business
with
a
handsome
fortune
he
was
living
his
last
years
in
perfect
union
with
his
wife
their
only
regret
being
that
they
had
no
children
marc
resumed
may
now
feel
certain
that
he
will
not
be
worried
any
more
it
is
he
you
know
who
in
spite
of
all
difficulties
transformed
the
town
with
his
school
and
made
your
election
possible
you
were
the
first
great
worker
darras
exclaimed
forget
the
immense
services
which
you
rendered
but
you
may
be
quite
easy
joulic
is
now
safe
from
all
vexations
and
i
will
help
him
as
much
as
i
can
in
his
efforts
to
make
maillebois
free
and
intelligent
besides
your
daughter
louise
and
simon
son
joseph
are
now
in
their
turn
continuing
the
work
of
liberation
you
are
a
knot
of
brave
but
modest
workers
to
whom
we
shall
all
feel
very
grateful
hereafter
then
for
a
moment
they
chatted
about
the
now
distant
times
when
marc
had
been
first
appointed
to
the
maillebois
school
more
than
thirty
years
had
elapsed
and
how
many
were
the
events
that
had
occurred
and
how
many
were
the
children
who
had
passed
through
the
schoolroom
and
carried
some
of
the
new
spirit
into
the
district
around
them
marc
recalled
some
of
his
old
his
first
pupils
fernand
bongard
the
little
peasant
with
the
hard
nut
who
had
married
lucille
doloir
an
intelligent
girl
whom
mademoiselle
rouzaire
had
tried
to
rear
in
sanctimonious
fashion
was
now
the
father
of
a
girl
eleven
years
of
age
named
claire
whom
mademoiselle
mazeline
was
freeing
somewhat
from
clerical
servitude
then
auguste
doloir
the
mason
undisciplined
son
who
had
married
angèle
bongard
an
obstinate
young
woman
of
narrow
ambition
had
a
son
of
fifteen
adrien
a
remarkably
intelligent
youth
whom
joulic
his
master
greatly
praised
charles
doloir
the
locksmith
who
had
been
as
bad
a
pupil
as
his
brother
but
who
had
improved
somewhat
since
his
marriage
with
his
master
daughter
marthe
dupuis
also
had
a
son
marcel
who
was
now
thirteen
and
had
left
the
school
with
excellent
certificates
there
was
also
léon
doloir
who
thanks
to
marc
had
taken
to
the
teaching
profession
and
after
becoming
one
of
salvan
best
students
now
directed
the
school
at
les
bordes
assisted
by
his
wife
juliette
hochard
who
had
quitted
the
training
school
at
fontenay
with
i
against
her
name
that
young
couple
was
all
health
and
good
sense
and
their
life
was
brightened
by
the
presence
of
a
little
urchin
edmond
who
was
sharp
for
his
age
already
knowing
his
letters
thoroughly
then
came
the
twin
savins
first
achille
so
sly
so
addicted
to
falsehoods
as
a
boy
then
placed
with
a
dulled
like
his
father
by
years
of
office
work
and
married
to
a
colleague
sister
virginie
deschamps
a
lean
and
insignificant
by
whom
he
had
a
charming
little
girl
léontine
who
at
eleven
years
of
age
had
just
secured
her
certificate
and
was
one
of
mademoiselle
mazeline
favourite
pupils
then
came
philippe
savin
who
long
remaining
without
employment
had
been
rendered
better
by
a
life
of
hardship
and
was
now
still
a
bachelor
and
manager
of
a
model
farm
being
associated
in
that
enterprise
with
his
younger
brother
jules
the
most
intelligent
of
the
two
who
had
given
himself
to
the
soil
and
married
a
peasant
girl
rosalie
bonin
their
firstborn
pierre
now
six
years
old
having
lately
entered
joulic
school
thus
generation
followed
generation
each
going
towards
increase
of
knowledge
reason
truth
and
justice
and
it
was
assuredly
from
that
constant
evolution
which
education
produced
that
the
happiness
of
the
communities
of
the
future
would
spring
but
marc
was
more
particularly
interested
in
the
home
of
louise
and
joseph
and
in
that
of
his
dearest
pupil
sébastien
milhomme
who
had
married
sarah
that
day
on
quitting
darras
he
repaired
to
the
communal
school
in
order
to
see
his
daughter
mademoiselle
mazeline
now
more
than
sixty
years
of
age
with
a
record
of
forty
years
spent
in
elementary
teaching
had
like
salvan
lately
retired
to
jonville
where
she
now
dwelt
in
a
very
modest
little
house
near
his
beautiful
garden
she
might
still
have
rendered
some
services
in
her
profession
had
not
her
eyesight
failed
her
indeed
she
was
nearly
blind
in
retiring
however
she
at
least
had
the
consolation
of
handing
her
duties
over
to
her
assistant
louise
who
was
appointed
head
mistress
in
her
stead
moreover
a
headmastership
at
beaumont
was
now
being
spoken
of
for
joulic
in
such
wise
that
his
assistant
joseph
might
succeed
him
at
maillebois
and
thus
the
young
couple
would
share
the
school
which
still
the
names
of
simon
and
marc
whose
good
work
they
would
continue
louise
who
was
now
two
and
thirty
had
presented
her
husband
with
a
son
françois
who
at
twelve
years
of
age
was
already
wonderfully
like
his
grandfather
marc
and
the
ambition
of
that
big
boy
with
the
lofty
brow
was
to
enter
the
training
college
like
his
forerunners
for
he
also
wished
to
become
an
elementary
teacher
it
was
a
thursday
marc
found
louise
just
quitting
a
housework
class
which
she
held
once
a
week
outside
the
regulation
hours
joseph
with
his
son
and
some
other
boys
had
gone
on
a
geological
and
botanical
ramble
along
the
banks
of
the
verpille
but
sarah
happened
to
be
with
louise
for
she
was
very
much
attached
to
her
and
always
visited
her
when
she
came
over
from
rouville
where
her
husband
sébastien
was
now
they
had
a
charming
little
girl
thérèse
in
whom
all
the
beauty
of
her
grandmother
rachel
had
reappeared
and
three
times
a
week
sarah
came
from
rouville
to
maillebois
the
journey
by
rail
lasting
barely
ten
minutes
in
order
to
superintend
the
tailoring
business
which
was
still
carried
on
at
old
lehmann
in
the
rue
du
trou
he
was
now
very
old
indeed
more
than
eighty
and
as
it
had
become
difficult
for
sarah
to
superintend
the
establishment
she
thought
of
disposing
of
it
as
soon
as
marc
had
kissed
louise
he
pressed
both
of
sarah
hands
how
is
my
faithful
sébastien
he
asked
is
your
big
girl
thérèse
and
how
are
you
yourself
my
dear
is
in
the
best
of
health
sarah
answered
gaily
grandfather
lehmann
is
as
strong
as
an
in
spite
of
his
advanced
years
and
i
have
had
good
news
from
yonder
you
know
uncle
david
has
written
to
say
that
my
father
has
got
over
the
attacks
of
fever
which
have
been
troubling
him
occasionally
marc
jogged
his
head
gently
yes
his
wound
is
not
altogether
healed
to
restore
him
completely
to
health
one
needs
that
rehabilitation
which
it
is
so
difficult
to
obtain
we
are
advancing
towards
it
however
i
am
still
full
of
hope
for
glorious
times
are
coming
remind
sébastien
that
each
boy
he
makes
a
man
of
will
be
another
worker
in
the
cause
of
truth
and
justice
then
marc
chatted
a
while
with
louise
giving
her
news
of
mademoiselle
mazeline
who
lived
a
very
retired
life
at
jonville
in
the
company
of
birds
and
flowers
and
he
made
his
daughter
promise
to
send
her
son
françois
to
spend
the
sunday
there
for
it
was
a
great
delight
for
his
grandmother
to
have
the
boy
with
her
occasionally
why
not
come
yourself
he
added
joseph
to
come
as
well
we
will
all
call
on
salvan
who
will
be
well
pleased
to
see
such
a
gathering
of
teachers
whose
father
in
a
measure
he
is
and
you
sarah
you
ought
to
come
with
sébastien
and
your
daughter
thérèse
let
it
be
a
general
outing
and
our
pleasure
will
be
complete
come
it
is
understood
eh
till
sunday
then
he
kissed
the
two
young
women
and
hurried
away
for
he
wished
to
catch
the
train
but
he
nearly
missed
it
by
reason
of
a
strange
encounter
which
for
a
moment
delayed
him
he
was
turning
out
of
the
high
street
into
the
avenue
leading
to
the
railway
station
when
he
espied
two
individuals
who
were
disputing
violently
behind
a
clump
of
spindle
trees
one
of
them
who
seemed
to
be
a
man
of
forty
attracted
marc
attention
by
his
long
livid
and
doltish
face
where
was
it
that
he
had
previously
seen
that
stupid
vicious
countenance
all
at
once
he
remembered
that
man
was
certainly
polydor
pélagie
nephew
for
more
than
twenty
years
marc
had
not
met
him
but
he
was
aware
that
he
had
been
dismissed
long
ago
from
the
beaumont
convent
which
he
had
entered
as
a
servant
and
that
he
led
a
chance
existence
among
the
knaves
of
disreputable
neighbourhoods
however
polydor
noticing
and
probably
recognising
the
bystander
who
was
looking
at
him
so
attentively
hastened
to
lead
his
companion
away
and
then
as
marc
glanced
at
the
other
man
he
started
with
surprise
clad
in
a
dirty
looking
both
wretched
and
fierce
polydor
companion
had
the
haggard
countenance
of
an
old
bird
of
prey
surely
he
was
brother
gorgias
marc
at
once
remembered
what
delbos
had
told
him
and
thereupon
wishing
to
arrive
at
a
certainty
he
started
after
the
two
men
who
had
already
turned
into
a
little
side
street
but
though
he
gave
the
street
a
good
look
he
could
see
nobody
polydor
and
the
other
had
disappeared
into
one
of
the
houses
of
suspicious
aspect
which
lined
it
then
marc
again
began
to
doubt
was
it
really
gorgias
whom
he
had
seen
he
was
not
prepared
to
swear
it
he
feared
that
he
had
perhaps
yielded
to
some
fancy
at
present
marc
triumphed
at
jonville
by
degrees
as
healthy
and
reasonable
men
had
emerged
from
his
school
the
mentality
of
the
region
had
improved
and
not
only
was
there
increase
of
knowledge
logic
frankness
and
brotherliness
but
great
material
prosperity
was
appearing
for
a
land
fortune
and
happiness
depend
solely
upon
the
mental
culture
and
the
civic
morality
of
its
inhabitants
again
then
was
abundance
returning
to
clean
and
homes
the
fields
thanks
to
newly
adopted
methods
of
culture
displayed
magnificent
crops
the
countryside
was
once
more
becoming
a
joy
for
the
eyes
in
the
bright
summer
sunshine
and
thus
a
happy
stretch
of
land
was
at
last
advancing
towards
that
perpetual
peace
which
for
centuries
had
been
so
ardently
desired
martineau
the
mayor
followed
by
the
whole
parish
council
now
acted
in
agreement
with
marc
a
series
of
incidents
had
hastened
that
good
understanding
by
which
all
desirable
reforms
were
accelerated
abbé
cognasse
after
for
some
time
restraining
himself
in
accordance
with
the
advice
given
him
at
valmarie
which
was
to
retain
his
influence
over
the
women
for
whoever
possesses
their
support
proves
invincible
had
relapsed
into
his
wonted
violence
incapable
as
he
was
of
long
remaining
patient
and
enraged
too
at
seeing
the
women
gradually
escape
from
him
owing
to
the
ill
grace
with
which
he
sought
to
detain
them
at
last
like
the
vengeful
minister
of
a
ravaging
and
exterminating
deity
he
became
absolutely
brutal
distributing
outrageous
punishment
in
his
wrath
at
the
slightest
offences
one
day
for
instance
he
rubbed
little
moulin
ears
till
they
positively
bled
merely
because
the
lad
had
playfully
pulled
the
skirts
of
the
terrible
palmyre
who
in
her
time
had
administered
smacks
and
whippings
so
freely
another
day
the
abbé
boxed
young
catherine
ears
in
church
because
she
laughed
during
mass
on
seeing
him
blow
his
nose
at
the
altar
and
finally
one
sunday
quite
beside
himself
at
finding
that
the
district
was
escaping
from
his
control
he
actually
launched
a
kick
at
madame
martineau
the
mayoress
imagining
that
she
defied
him
because
she
did
not
make
room
for
him
to
pass
as
quickly
as
he
desired
this
time
it
was
held
that
his
behaviour
exceeded
all
bounds
and
martineau
quite
enraged
cited
him
before
the
tribunal
of
correctional
police
with
the
result
that
the
battle
became
a
furious
one
cognasse
retaliating
with
fresh
acts
of
violence
and
gathering
quite
a
quantity
of
lawsuits
around
him
marc
meanwhile
anxious
to
complete
his
work
in
the
village
had
been
nursing
an
idea
which
he
was
at
last
able
to
carry
into
effect
in
consequence
of
some
new
laws
enacted
by
the
legislature
the
sisters
of
the
good
shepherd
who
carried
on
the
factory
in
which
two
hundred
were
sweated
and
starved
had
been
obliged
to
quit
jonville
and
it
was
a
good
riddance
for
the
district
a
a
shame
the
less
marc
however
persuaded
the
parish
council
to
purchase
the
large
factory
buildings
when
they
were
offered
for
sale
by
auction
his
idea
being
to
modify
and
turn
them
into
a
common
house
in
which
recreation
and
dancing
rooms
a
library
a
museum
and
even
some
free
baths
might
be
gradually
installed
as
by
degrees
the
resources
of
the
parish
increased
in
this
wise
he
dreamt
of
setting
in
full
view
of
the
church
a
kind
of
civic
palace
which
would
become
a
meeting
and
recreation
place
for
the
community
if
the
women
for
years
past
had
only
continued
to
go
to
mass
in
order
to
show
their
new
gowns
and
see
those
of
their
acquaintances
they
would
yet
more
willingly
repair
to
that
cheerful
palace
of
solidarity
where
a
little
healthy
amusement
would
await
them
thus
the
recreation
rooms
were
the
first
inaugurated
and
the
ceremony
gave
rise
to
a
great
popular
demonstration
the
desire
of
the
inhabitants
was
to
efface
and
redeem
that
former
consecration
of
the
parish
to
the
sacred
heart
which
had
filled
the
mayor
and
the
council
with
keen
remorse
ever
since
they
had
recovered
their
senses
martineau
for
his
part
accounted
for
that
proceeding
by
accusing
jauffre
of
having
abandoned
him
to
abbé
cognasse
after
disturbing
his
mind
by
threatening
both
the
parish
and
himself
with
all
sorts
of
misfortunes
if
he
did
not
submit
to
the
church
which
would
always
be
the
most
powerful
of
the
social
forces
martineau
who
now
perceived
that
this
was
not
correct
for
the
church
was
already
being
beaten
and
the
more
the
district
drew
away
from
it
the
more
prosperous
it
became
was
very
desirous
of
setting
himself
on
the
winning
side
like
a
practical
peasant
one
who
talked
little
but
who
always
kept
his
eye
fixed
on
the
main
chance
he
would
therefore
have
liked
some
kind
of
abjuration
some
ceremony
such
as
might
allow
him
to
come
forward
at
the
head
of
the
council
and
restore
the
parish
to
the
worship
of
reason
and
truth
in
order
to
wipe
out
that
former
ceremony
when
it
had
dedicated
itself
to
dementia
and
falsehood
and
it
was
this
desire
which
marc
thought
of
fulfilling
by
arranging
that
the
mayor
and
the
council
should
in
a
fitting
manner
inaugurate
the
recreation
rooms
of
the
new
common
house
in
which
it
was
proposed
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
district
should
meet
every
sunday
to
take
part
in
suitable
civic
festivities
great
preparations
were
made
it
was
arranged
that
the
pupils
of
marc
and
geneviève
should
act
a
little
play
dance
and
sing
an
orchestra
was
soon
recruited
among
the
young
men
of
the
region
maidens
clad
in
white
were
also
to
sing
and
dance
in
honour
of
the
work
of
the
fields
and
the
joys
of
life
indeed
it
was
particularly
life
lived
healthily
and
fully
overflowing
with
duties
and
felicities
that
was
to
be
celebrated
as
the
universal
source
of
strength
and
certainty
and
the
various
games
and
recreations
which
had
been
provided
games
of
skill
and
energy
gymnastic
appliances
with
running
tracks
and
lawns
set
out
in
the
adjoining
grounds
were
to
be
handed
over
to
the
young
folk
who
would
meet
there
every
week
while
shady
nooks
would
be
reserved
for
wives
and
mothers
who
would
be
drawn
together
and
enlivened
by
having
a
a
meeting
place
assigned
to
them
for
the
inaugural
ceremony
the
rooms
were
decorated
with
flowers
and
foliage
and
already
at
an
early
hour
the
inhabitants
of
jonville
clad
in
their
sunday
best
filled
the
village
streets
with
their
mirth
by
marc
desire
and
with
the
consent
of
the
parents
mignot
that
sunday
brought
his
pupils
over
from
le
moreux
in
order
that
they
might
participate
in
the
festivity
he
was
met
by
marc
near
the
church
just
as
old
palmyre
the
door
of
the
edifice
in
a
violent
wrathful
fashion
that
morning
abbé
cognasse
had
said
mass
to
empty
benches
and
it
was
he
who
in
a
fit
of
furious
anger
had
ordered
his
servant
to
close
the
church
nobody
should
enter
it
again
said
he
as
those
impious
people
were
bent
on
offering
sacrifices
to
the
idols
of
human
bestiality
he
himself
had
disappeared
hiding
away
in
the
parsonage
whose
garden
wall
bordered
the
road
leading
to
the
new
common
house
is
the
second
sunday
that
he
has
not
gone
to
le
moreux
mignot
said
to
marc
declares
with
some
truth
that
it
is
not
worth
his
while
to
trudge
so
many
miles
to
say
mass
in
the
presence
of
two
old
women
and
three
little
girls
the
whole
village
has
rebelled
against
him
you
know
since
he
brutally
spanked
little
eugénie
louvard
for
having
put
out
her
tongue
to
him
though
that
is
only
one
of
the
acts
of
violence
in
which
he
has
indulged
since
he
has
felt
himself
to
be
defeated
curiously
enough
it
is
i
who
am
obliged
to
defend
him
now
for
fear
lest
the
indignant
villagers
should
do
him
an
injury
mignot
laughed
and
on
being
questioned
gave
further
particulars
saleur
our
mayor
has
talked
of
bringing
an
action
against
him
and
writing
to
his
bishop
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
i
at
first
had
some
difficulty
in
extricating
le
moreux
from
the
ignorance
and
credulity
in
which
it
was
steeped
by
my
predecessor
chagnat
at
present
i
simply
have
to
let
events
follow
their
course
the
whole
population
is
rallying
around
me
the
school
will
soon
reign
without
a
rival
for
as
the
church
is
being
shut
up
the
battle
is
virtually
over
we
have
not
got
to
that
point
yet
marc
answered
at
jonville
cognasse
will
resist
till
the
last
moment
that
is
as
long
as
he
is
paid
by
the
state
and
imposed
on
us
by
rome
but
i
have
often
thought
that
the
lonely
little
hamlets
like
le
moreux
particularly
when
life
is
easy
there
would
be
the
first
to
free
themselves
from
the
priests
because
the
latter
departure
would
make
virtually
no
alteration
in
their
social
life
when
people
do
like
their
priest
when
they
go
to
church
less
and
less
the
disappearance
of
the
priest
is
witnessed
without
regret
however
marc
and
mignot
could
not
linger
chatting
any
longer
for
the
ceremony
would
soon
begin
so
they
repaired
to
the
common
house
where
their
pupils
had
now
assembled
they
there
found
geneviève
with
salvan
and
mademoiselle
mazeline
both
the
latter
having
emerged
from
their
retirement
to
attend
that
festival
which
was
so
to
say
their
work
the
celebration
of
their
teaching
and
everything
passed
off
in
a
very
simple
fraternal
and
joyous
manner
the
authorities
martineau
wearing
his
scarf
of
office
at
the
head
of
the
council
took
possession
of
that
little
palace
of
the
people
in
the
name
of
the
parish
then
the
schoolchildren
acted
played
and
sang
inaugurating
as
it
were
the
future
of
happy
peace
and
beneficent
work
with
their
healthy
and
innocent
hands
it
was
indeed
youth
it
was
the
children
who
would
overcome
the
last
obstacles
on
the
road
to
the
future
city
of
perfect
solidarity
that
which
the
child
of
had
been
unable
to
do
would
be
done
by
the
child
of
and
when
the
little
ones
had
raised
their
cry
of
hope
the
youths
and
the
maidens
came
forward
displaying
the
promise
of
early
fruitfulness
one
found
too
maturity
and
harvest
in
all
the
assembled
fathers
and
mothers
behind
whom
were
the
old
folk
typifying
the
happy
evening
which
attends
life
when
it
has
been
lived
as
it
should
be
lived
and
all
were
now
acquiring
a
true
consciousness
of
things
setting
their
ideal
no
longer
in
any
mysticism
but
in
the
proper
regulation
of
human
life
which
needed
to
be
all
reason
truth
and
justice
in
order
that
mankind
might
dwell
together
in
peace
brotherliness
and
happiness
henceforth
jonville
would
have
a
meeting
hall
in
that
fraternal
house
where
joy
and
health
would
take
the
place
of
threat
and
punishment
where
enlightenment
would
gladden
the
hearts
of
one
and
all
no
heart
nor
mind
would
be
disturbed
there
by
mystical
impostures
no
shares
in
any
false
paradise
would
be
offered
for
sale
those
who
came
forth
from
that
building
would
be
cheerful
citizens
happy
to
live
for
the
sake
of
the
joy
of
life
and
all
the
cruel
and
grotesque
absurdity
of
dogmas
would
crumble
in
the
presence
of
that
simple
gaiety
that
beneficent
light
the
dancing
lasted
until
the
evening
never
had
the
comely
peasant
women
of
jonville
participated
in
such
a
festival
everybody
noticed
the
radiant
countenance
of
madame
martineau
who
had
remained
one
of
abbé
cognasse
last
worshippers
though
in
reality
she
had
only
gone
to
church
in
order
to
show
off
her
new
gowns
she
wore
a
new
gown
that
day
and
was
delighted
at
being
able
to
display
it
without
any
fear
that
it
might
become
soiled
by
trailing
over
damp
and
dirty
flagstones
again
she
knew
that
she
ran
no
risk
of
being
kicked
if
she
did
not
get
soon
enough
out
of
somebody
way
briefly
in
that
common
house
jonville
would
at
last
have
a
fitting
where
one
and
all
might
freely
meet
and
chat
and
even
indulge
in
a
little
harmless
coquetry
but
it
so
happened
that
an
extraordinary
incident
marked
the
close
of
that
great
day
marc
and
geneviève
were
escorting
their
pupils
homeward
with
mignot
who
also
had
marshalled
his
children
together
and
salvan
and
mademoiselle
mazeline
likewise
figured
in
the
party
which
was
all
gaiety
jest
and
laughter
near
by
too
there
was
madame
martineau
accompanied
by
a
group
of
women
to
whom
she
recounted
the
result
of
the
legal
proceedings
which
her
husband
had
brought
against
the
priest
for
kicking
her
fifteen
witnesses
had
given
evidence
before
the
court
and
after
some
uproarious
proceedings
abbé
cognasse
had
been
sentenced
to
a
fine
of
five
and
twenty
francs
this
being
the
chief
cause
of
the
fury
which
he
had
displayed
for
several
days
past
and
all
at
once
as
madame
martineau
finishing
her
narrative
as
she
passed
the
parsonage
garden
remarked
that
the
fine
was
no
more
than
the
priest
deserved
abbé
cognasse
in
person
popped
his
head
over
the
garden
wall
and
began
to
vociferate
insults
you
vain
hussy
he
cried
lying
thing
how
dare
you
spit
on
god
i
force
your
serpent
tongue
back
into
your
throat
how
was
it
that
the
priest
happened
to
be
there
at
that
particular
moment
nobody
could
tell
perhaps
he
had
been
waiting
behind
the
wall
for
the
return
of
the
villagers
perhaps
he
had
set
a
ladder
in
readiness
in
order
that
he
might
climb
and
look
over
at
all
events
when
he
perceived
la
martineau
in
her
new
gown
surrounded
by
a
number
of
other
sprucely
dressed
women
who
had
deserted
the
church
to
attend
an
impious
ceremony
in
the
devil
house
he
completely
lost
his
head
shameless
creatures
you
make
the
very
angels
weep
he
shouted
cursed
creatures
you
poison
the
whole
district
with
your
filth
but
wait
wait
a
moment
i
will
settle
your
accounts
for
you
without
waiting
for
satan
to
come
and
take
you
and
forthwith
exasperated
as
he
was
at
no
longer
having
even
the
women
with
him
those
unhappy
feared
and
execrated
women
whom
the
church
captures
and
employs
as
its
instruments
he
tore
some
stones
from
the
ruined
coping
of
the
wall
and
flung
them
with
his
lean
dark
hands
at
madame
martineau
and
her
companions
one
for
you
la
mathurine
he
shouted
know
of
your
goings
on
with
your
husband
farm
hands
that
one
for
you
la
durande
you
robbed
your
sister
of
her
share
of
your
father
property
and
here
for
you
la
désirée
you
have
yet
paid
for
the
three
masses
which
i
said
for
the
repose
of
your
child
soul
and
as
for
you
you
la
martineau
who
got
the
judges
to
condemn
god
and
me
here
one
stone
and
two
and
three
yes
wait
a
moment
you
shall
have
a
stone
for
every
one
of
those
five
and
twenty
francs
the
scandal
was
tremendous
two
women
were
struck
and
the
rural
guard
who
had
now
come
up
at
once
began
to
scribble
an
official
report
amidst
the
shouting
and
hooting
abbé
cognasse
suddenly
recovered
his
senses
like
some
deity
threatening
the
world
with
destruction
he
made
a
last
fierce
gesture
then
sprang
down
his
ladder
and
disappeared
like
a
jack
into
his
box
he
had
just
set
another
fine
lawsuit
on
his
shoulders
which
bent
already
beneath
a
pile
of
citations
on
the
following
thursday
marc
repaired
to
maillebois
and
a
fancy
which
had
been
haunting
him
for
some
time
past
was
then
suddenly
changed
into
certainty
while
crossing
the
little
place
des
capucins
his
attention
was
attracted
by
a
man
who
stood
in
front
of
the
brothers
school
gazing
fixedly
at
the
dilapidated
walls
and
marc
immediately
recognised
this
man
to
be
the
one
whom
he
had
perceived
with
polydor
in
the
avenue
leading
to
the
railway
station
a
month
previously
this
time
he
had
no
cause
for
hesitation
he
was
able
to
examine
the
man
at
his
ease
in
the
broad
sunlight
and
he
saw
that
he
was
indeed
brother
gorgias
gorgias
in
old
and
greasy
clothing
with
hollow
cheeks
and
bent
limbs
but
still
easily
recognisable
by
the
large
fierce
beak
which
jutted
out
from
between
his
projecting
thus
delbos
had
not
been
mistaken
gorgias
had
really
returned
and
doubtless
had
been
prowling
about
the
region
for
a
good
many
months
already
the
ignorantine
amid
the
reverie
into
which
he
had
sunk
as
he
stood
on
that
sleepy
and
almost
invariably
deserted
little
square
must
have
become
conscious
of
the
scrutinising
gaze
which
was
being
directed
upon
him
he
slowly
turned
round
and
his
eyes
then
met
those
of
the
man
who
stood
only
a
few
steps
away
and
he
on
his
side
assuredly
recognised
marc
instead
however
of
evincing
any
alarm
instead
of
taking
to
his
heels
as
he
had
done
on
the
first
occasion
he
lingered
there
and
his
old
sneer
that
involuntary
twitching
of
the
lips
which
disclosed
some
of
his
wolfish
teeth
in
a
manner
suggesting
both
contempt
and
cruelty
appeared
upon
his
face
then
pointing
to
the
walls
of
the
brothers
school
he
said
quietly
sight
must
please
you
every
time
you
pass
this
way
eh
monsieur
froment
it
angers
me
i
like
to
set
fire
to
the
shanty
and
burn
the
last
of
those
cowards
in
it
then
as
marc
shuddered
without
replying
thunderstruck
as
he
was
by
the
bandit
audacity
in
addressing
him
gorgias
again
grinned
in
his
silent
evil
way
and
added
you
astonished
that
i
should
confess
myself
to
you
you
no
doubt
were
my
worst
enemy
but
after
all
why
should
i
bear
you
malice
you
owed
me
nothing
you
were
fighting
for
your
own
opinions
the
men
i
hate
and
whom
i
mean
to
pursue
until
my
last
breath
are
my
superiors
my
brothers
in
jesus
christ
all
those
whose
duty
it
was
to
cover
and
save
me
but
who
flung
me
into
the
streets
hoping
i
should
die
of
shame
and
starvation
i
myself
it
may
be
allowed
am
but
a
poor
and
erring
creature
but
it
was
god
whom
those
wretched
cowards
betrayed
and
sold
for
it
is
their
fault
the
fault
of
their
imbecile
weakness
if
the
church
is
now
near
to
defeat
and
if
that
poor
school
yonder
is
already
falling
to
pieces
ah
when
one
remembers
what
a
position
it
held
in
my
time
we
were
the
victors
then
we
had
reduced
your
secular
schools
to
next
to
nothing
but
now
they
are
triumphing
and
will
soon
be
the
only
ones
left
the
thought
of
it
fills
me
with
regret
and
anger
then
as
two
old
women
crossed
the
square
and
a
capuchin
came
out
of
the
neighbouring
chapel
gorgias
after
glancing
anxiously
about
him
added
swiftly
in
an
undertone
to
me
monsieur
froment
for
a
long
time
past
i
have
wished
to
have
a
chat
with
you
if
you
are
willing
i
will
call
on
you
at
jonville
some
day
after
nightfall
then
he
hurried
off
disappearing
before
marc
could
say
a
word
the
schoolmaster
who
was
quite
upset
by
that
meeting
spoke
of
it
to
nobody
excepting
his
wife
who
felt
alarmed
when
she
heard
of
it
they
agreed
that
they
would
not
admit
that
man
if
he
should
venture
to
call
on
them
for
the
visit
he
announced
might
well
prove
to
be
some
machination
of
treachery
and
falsehood
gorgias
had
always
lied
and
he
would
lie
again
so
it
was
absurd
to
expect
from
him
any
useful
new
fact
such
as
had
been
sought
so
long
however
some
months
elapsed
and
the
other
made
no
sign
in
such
wise
that
marc
who
at
the
outset
had
remained
watchful
with
a
view
of
keeping
his
door
shut
gradually
grew
astonished
and
impatient
he
wondered
what
might
be
the
things
which
gorgias
had
wished
to
tell
him
and
a
desire
to
know
them
worried
him
more
and
more
after
all
why
should
he
not
receive
the
scamp
even
if
he
learnt
nothing
useful
from
him
he
would
have
an
opportunity
of
fathoming
his
nature
and
having
come
to
that
conclusion
marc
lived
on
in
suspense
waiting
for
the
visit
which
was
so
long
deferred
at
last
one
winter
evening
when
the
rain
was
pouring
in
torrents
brother
gorgias
presented
himself
clad
in
an
old
cloak
streaming
with
mud
and
water
as
soon
as
he
had
rid
himself
of
that
rag
marc
showed
him
into
his
classroom
which
was
still
warm
for
the
fire
in
the
faïence
stove
was
only
just
dying
out
a
little
oil
lamp
alone
cast
some
light
over
a
portion
of
that
large
and
silent
room
around
which
big
shadows
had
gathered
and
geneviève
trembling
slightly
with
a
vague
fear
of
some
possible
attempt
upon
her
husband
remained
listening
behind
a
door
as
for
brother
gorgias
he
without
any
ado
resumed
the
conversation
interrupted
on
the
place
des
capucins
as
if
it
had
taken
place
that
very
afternoon
know
monsieur
froment
he
began
church
is
dying
because
she
no
longer
possesses
any
priests
resolute
enough
to
support
her
by
fire
and
steel
if
need
be
not
one
of
the
poor
fools
the
whimpering
clowns
of
the
present
day
loves
or
even
knows
the
real
god
he
who
at
once
exterminated
the
nations
that
dared
to
disobey
him
and
who
reigned
over
the
bodies
and
souls
of
men
like
an
absolute
master
ever
armed
with
resistless
thunderbolts
how
can
you
expect
the
world
to
be
different
from
what
it
is
if
the
deity
now
merely
has
poltroons
and
fools
to
speak
in
his
name
then
gorgias
enumerated
his
superiors
his
brothers
in
christ
as
he
called
them
one
by
one
and
a
perfect
massacre
ensued
monseigneur
bergerot
who
had
lately
died
at
the
advanced
age
of
had
never
been
aught
than
a
poor
timid
incoherent
creature
lacking
the
necessary
courage
to
secede
from
rome
and
establish
that
famous
liberal
and
rationalist
church
of
france
which
he
had
dreamt
of
and
which
would
have
been
little
else
than
a
new
protestant
sect
those
lettered
bishops
gifted
with
inquiring
minds
but
destitute
of
all
sturdiness
of
faith
suffered
the
incredulous
masses
to
desert
the
altars
instead
of
flagellating
them
mercilessly
with
the
dread
of
hell
but
most
intense
hatred
was
directed
against
abbé
quandieu
who
still
survived
though
his
eightieth
year
was
past
for
the
ignorantine
the
of
martin
was
a
perjurer
an
apostate
a
bad
priest
who
had
spat
upon
his
own
religion
by
openly
upholding
god
enemies
at
the
time
of
the
simon
case
moreover
he
had
abandoned
his
ministry
and
gone
to
dwell
in
a
little
house
in
a
lonely
neighbourhood
impudently
saying
that
he
was
disgusted
with
the
base
superstition
of
the
last
believers
and
carrying
his
audacity
so
far
as
to
pretend
that
the
monks
whom
he
called
the
traders
of
the
temple
were
demolishers
who
unconsciously
hastened
the
downfall
of
the
church
but
if
there
was
a
demolisher
it
was
he
himself
for
his
desertion
had
served
as
an
argument
to
the
enemies
of
catholicism
surely
indeed
it
was
an
abominable
example
that
he
had
set
forswearing
all
his
past
life
breaking
his
vows
and
preferring
a
sleek
and
shameful
old
age
to
martyrdom
as
for
that
big
lean
stern
abbé
coquart
his
successor
at
martin
however
imposing
the
newcomer
might
look
he
was
in
reality
only
a
fool
marc
had
for
a
while
listened
in
silence
determined
to
offer
no
interruption
but
his
feelings
rebelled
when
he
heard
gorgias
violent
attack
upon
abbé
quandieu
do
not
know
that
priest
he
said
quietly
judgment
is
that
of
an
enemy
blinded
by
spite
as
a
matter
of
fact
abbé
quandieu
was
the
only
priest
of
this
region
who
at
the
outset
understood
what
frightful
harm
the
church
would
do
herself
by
openly
and
passionately
defying
truth
and
justice
she
claims
to
represent
a
deity
of
certainty
and
equity
kindness
and
innocence
she
was
founded
to
exalt
the
suffering
and
the
meek
and
yet
all
at
once
in
order
to
retain
temporal
authority
she
makes
common
cause
with
oppressors
and
liars
and
forgers
it
was
certain
that
the
consequences
would
be
terrible
for
her
as
soon
as
simon
innocence
should
become
manifest
such
conduct
was
suicide
on
the
part
with
her
own
hands
she
prepared
her
condemnation
showing
the
world
that
she
was
no
longer
the
abode
of
the
true
and
the
just
of
everlasting
purity
and
goodness
and
her
expiation
is
only
just
beginning
she
will
slowly
die
of
that
denial
of
justice
which
she
took
upon
herself
and
which
has
become
a
devouring
sore
abbé
quandieu
foresaw
it
and
said
it
it
is
not
true
that
he
fled
from
the
church
in
any
spirit
of
cowardice
he
quitted
his
ministry
bleeding
and
weeping
and
it
is
in
grief
that
he
is
ending
a
life
of
misery
and
bitterness
by
a
rough
gesture
gorgias
signified
that
he
did
not
intend
to
argue
with
his
glowing
eyes
gazing
far
away
into
the
galling
memories
of
his
personal
experiences
he
scarcely
listened
to
marc
impatient
as
he
was
to
continue
his
own
rageful
diatribe
good
i
say
what
i
think
he
resumed
i
do
prevent
you
from
thinking
whatever
you
please
there
are
at
all
events
other
imbeciles
and
cowards
whom
you
wo
defend
for
instance
that
rascal
father
théodose
the
mirror
of
the
devotees
the
thieving
cashier
of
heaven
thereupon
gorgias
assailed
the
superior
of
the
capuchins
with
murderous
fury
he
did
not
blame
the
worship
of
antony
of
padua
on
the
contrary
he
praised
it
he
set
all
his
hopes
in
miracles
he
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
the
whole
world
bringing
money
to
the
shrine
of
the
saint
in
order
that
the
latter
might
persuade
the
deity
to
hurl
his
thunderbolts
upon
the
cities
of
sin
but
father
théodose
was
a
mere
conscienceless
mountebank
who
amassed
money
for
himself
alone
and
gave
no
assistance
whatever
to
the
afflicted
servants
of
god
though
hundreds
of
thousands
of
francs
had
formerly
overflowed
from
his
collection
boxes
he
had
not
devoted
even
an
occasional
piece
to
render
life
a
little
less
hard
than
it
was
to
the
poor
brothers
of
the
christian
doctrine
his
neighbours
and
now
that
the
gifts
he
received
were
dwindling
year
by
year
his
avarice
was
even
greater
he
had
refused
the
smallest
alms
to
him
brother
gorgias
at
a
time
when
he
was
in
the
most
desperate
circumstances
when
indeed
a
piece
might
have
saved
his
life
they
all
abandoned
him
yes
all
not
only
that
lecherous
father
théodose
but
even
the
other
the
great
chief
the
great
culprit
who
was
as
big
a
fool
as
he
was
a
rascal
then
gorgias
blurted
out
the
name
of
father
crabot
which
had
been
burning
his
lips
ah
father
crabot
father
crabot
he
had
worshipped
him
in
former
times
he
had
served
him
on
his
knees
in
respectful
silence
ready
to
carry
his
devotion
to
the
point
of
crime
he
had
then
regarded
him
as
an
able
and
valiant
master
favoured
by
jesus
who
had
promised
him
eternal
victory
in
this
world
by
father
side
he
gorgias
had
thought
himself
protected
from
the
wicked
assured
of
success
in
every
enterprise
even
the
most
dangerous
and
yet
that
venerated
master
to
whom
he
had
dedicated
his
life
that
glorious
father
crabot
now
denied
him
and
left
him
without
shelter
and
without
a
crust
he
did
worse
indeed
he
cast
him
upon
the
waters
as
if
he
were
a
troublesome
accomplice
whose
disappearance
was
desired
besides
had
he
not
always
displayed
the
most
monstrous
egotism
had
he
not
previously
sacrificed
poor
father
philibin
who
had
lately
died
in
the
italian
convent
where
he
had
lingered
virtually
dead
for
many
years
already
father
philibin
had
been
a
hero
a
victim
who
had
invariably
obeyed
his
superior
who
had
carried
devotion
so
far
as
to
take
upon
his
shoulders
all
the
punishment
for
the
deeds
which
had
been
commanded
of
him
and
which
he
had
done
in
silence
yet
another
victim
was
that
hallucinated
brother
fulgence
a
perfect
nincompoop
with
his
excitable
sparrow
brain
but
who
none
the
less
had
not
deserved
to
be
swept
away
into
the
nothingness
in
which
somewhere
or
other
he
was
dying
what
good
purpose
had
been
served
by
all
that
villainy
and
ingratitude
had
it
not
been
as
stupid
as
it
was
cruel
on
father
crabot
part
to
abandon
in
that
fashion
all
his
old
friends
all
the
instruments
of
his
fortune
had
not
his
own
position
been
shaken
by
his
conduct
in
allowing
the
others
to
be
struck
down
and
had
he
never
thought
that
one
of
them
might
at
last
grow
weary
of
it
all
and
rise
up
and
cast
terrible
truths
in
his
face
all
crabot
grand
manners
cried
brother
gorgias
excitedly
all
his
reputation
for
cleverness
and
diplomatic
skill
there
is
rank
stupidity
he
must
be
quite
a
fool
to
treat
me
in
the
way
he
does
but
let
him
take
care
let
him
take
care
or
else
one
of
these
days
before
long
i
shall
speak
out
at
this
marc
who
had
been
listening
with
passionate
interest
made
an
effort
to
hasten
the
other
revelations
out
what
have
you
to
say
then
he
inquired
nothing
there
are
only
some
matters
between
him
and
me
i
shall
tell
them
to
god
alone
in
a
confession
then
reverting
to
his
bitter
catalogue
of
accusations
gorgias
exclaimed
to
finish
there
that
brother
joachim
whom
they
have
set
at
the
head
of
our
school
at
maillebois
in
brother
fulgence
place
joachim
is
another
of
father
crabot
creatures
a
hypocrite
chosen
on
account
of
his
supposed
skill
and
artfulness
one
who
imagines
himself
to
be
a
great
man
because
he
does
not
pull
the
ears
of
the
little
vermin
entrusted
to
him
you
know
the
result
the
school
will
soon
have
to
be
closed
for
lack
of
pupils
if
the
wretched
offspring
of
men
are
to
grow
up
fairly
well
they
must
be
trained
by
kicks
and
blows
as
god
requires
and
if
you
want
my
opinion
there
is
only
one
priest
imbued
with
the
right
spirit
in
the
whole
region
and
that
is
your
abbé
cognasse
he
too
went
to
seek
advice
at
valmarie
and
they
nearly
rotted
him
as
they
rotted
the
others
by
advising
him
to
be
supple
and
crafty
but
he
fortunately
regained
possession
of
himself
it
is
with
stones
that
he
now
pursues
the
enemies
of
the
church
that
is
the
right
course
for
the
real
saints
to
follow
that
is
the
way
in
which
god
when
he
chooses
to
interfere
will
end
by
reconquering
the
world
thus
speaking
gorgias
raised
his
clenched
fists
and
brandished
them
wildly
vehemently
in
that
usually
quiet
classroom
where
the
little
lamp
shed
but
a
faint
glimmer
of
light
then
for
a
moment
came
deep
silence
amid
which
one
only
heard
the
pouring
rain
pattering
on
the
at
all
events
said
marc
with
a
touch
of
irony
seems
to
have
forsaken
and
sacrificed
you
even
as
your
superiors
have
done
brother
gorgias
glanced
at
his
wretched
clothes
and
emaciated
hands
which
testified
to
his
sufferings
is
true
he
answered
has
chastised
me
severely
for
my
transgressions
and
for
those
of
others
i
bow
to
his
will
he
is
working
my
salvation
but
i
do
not
forget
i
do
not
forgive
the
others
for
having
aggravated
my
misery
ah
the
bandits
have
they
not
condemned
me
to
the
most
frightful
existence
ever
since
they
compelled
me
to
quit
maillebois
it
is
in
misery
that
i
have
had
to
come
back
here
to
endeavour
to
wring
from
them
the
crust
of
bread
which
is
my
due
he
was
unwilling
to
say
more
on
that
subject
but
his
tragic
story
could
be
well
divined
by
the
shudder
that
came
over
him
the
shudder
of
a
wild
beast
driven
from
the
woods
by
hunger
the
order
no
doubt
had
sent
him
from
community
to
community
the
poorest
the
most
obscure
until
at
last
it
had
finally
cast
him
out
altogether
as
being
by
far
too
compromising
and
then
he
had
quitted
his
gown
and
rolled
along
the
roads
carrying
with
him
the
stigma
attaching
to
a
disfrocked
cleric
one
would
never
know
through
what
distant
lands
he
had
roamed
what
a
life
of
privation
and
chance
he
had
led
what
unacknowledgeable
adventures
he
had
met
with
what
shameful
vices
he
had
indulged
in
one
could
only
read
a
little
of
all
that
on
the
tanned
skin
of
his
eager
face
in
the
depths
of
his
eyes
which
glowed
with
suffering
and
hatred
the
greater
part
of
his
resources
must
certainly
have
come
from
his
former
confederates
who
had
wished
to
purchase
his
silence
and
keep
him
at
a
distance
every
now
and
again
when
he
had
written
letter
upon
letter
when
he
had
furiously
threatened
crushing
revelations
some
small
sum
had
been
sent
to
him
and
then
for
a
few
months
he
had
been
able
to
prolong
the
wretched
life
he
led
as
a
waif
whom
all
rejected
but
at
last
a
time
had
come
when
he
had
no
longer
received
any
answer
to
his
applications
when
his
letters
and
his
threats
had
remained
without
any
effect
for
his
former
superiors
had
grown
weary
of
his
voracious
demands
and
regarded
him
perhaps
as
being
no
longer
dangerous
after
the
lapse
of
so
many
years
he
himself
was
intelligent
enough
to
understand
that
his
confessions
could
no
longer
have
any
very
serious
consequences
for
his
accomplices
but
might
even
deprive
him
of
his
last
chance
of
extracting
money
from
them
nevertheless
he
had
resolved
to
return
and
prowl
around
maillebois
he
knew
the
code
he
was
aware
that
the
law
of
limitation
covered
him
and
thus
for
long
months
he
had
been
living
in
some
dark
nook
on
the
pieces
which
he
wrung
from
the
fears
of
simon
accusers
who
still
trembled
at
the
thought
of
their
shameful
victory
at
rozan
yet
they
must
again
have
been
growing
weary
of
his
persecution
for
his
bitterness
was
too
great
he
would
never
have
heaped
so
many
insults
upon
them
if
they
had
let
him
dip
his
hands
in
their
purses
the
previous
day
by
way
of
once
more
purchasing
his
silence
marc
readily
understood
the
position
brother
gorgias
only
sprang
out
of
the
suspicious
darkness
in
which
he
concealed
himself
when
he
had
spent
his
money
in
crapulous
debauchery
and
if
he
had
come
to
jonville
that
winter
night
in
the
pouring
rain
it
was
assuredly
because
his
pockets
were
empty
and
because
he
expected
to
derive
some
profit
from
that
visit
but
what
profit
could
it
be
what
motive
lurked
beneath
his
long
and
furious
denunciation
of
the
men
of
whom
according
to
his
own
account
he
had
only
been
a
docile
instrument
you
are
living
at
maillebois
inquired
marc
whose
curiosity
was
fully
awakened
no
not
at
maillebois
i
live
where
i
can
i
thought
i
had
already
seen
you
there
before
meeting
you
on
the
place
des
capucins
you
were
with
one
of
your
former
pupils
polydor
i
fancy
a
faint
smile
appeared
on
brother
gorgias
ravaged
face
said
he
yes
i
was
always
very
fond
of
him
he
was
a
pious
and
discreet
lad
like
myself
he
has
suffered
from
the
maliciousness
of
men
he
has
been
accused
of
all
sorts
of
crimes
cast
out
unjustly
by
people
who
did
not
understand
his
nature
and
i
was
glad
to
meet
him
when
i
returned
here
we
set
our
wretchedness
together
and
consoled
each
other
abandoning
ourselves
to
the
divine
arms
of
our
lord
but
polydor
is
young
and
he
will
end
by
treating
me
as
the
others
have
done
for
a
month
past
i
have
been
looking
for
him
he
has
disappeared
ah
everything
is
going
wrong
there
must
be
an
end
to
it
all
a
raucous
sigh
escaped
him
and
marc
shuddered
for
gorgias
manner
and
tone
as
he
referred
to
polydor
afforded
a
glimpse
of
yet
another
hell
but
there
was
no
time
for
reflection
drawing
nearer
to
the
schoolmaster
the
disfrocked
brother
resumed
listen
to
me
monsieur
froment
i
have
had
enough
of
it
i
have
come
to
tell
you
everything
yes
if
you
will
promise
to
listen
to
me
as
a
priest
would
listen
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
the
real
truth
you
are
the
only
man
to
whom
i
can
make
such
a
confession
without
doing
violence
to
my
dignity
or
pride
for
you
alone
have
always
been
a
disinterested
and
loyal
enemy
so
receive
my
confession
on
the
one
understanding
that
you
will
keep
it
secret
until
i
authorise
you
to
divulge
it
but
marc
hastily
interrupted
him
no
i
will
not
enter
into
such
a
compact
i
have
done
nothing
to
provoke
any
revelations
on
your
part
you
have
come
here
of
your
own
accord
and
you
say
what
you
please
should
you
really
place
the
truth
in
my
hands
i
mean
to
remain
at
liberty
to
make
use
of
it
according
as
my
conscience
may
bid
me
brother
gorgias
scarcely
hesitated
let
it
be
so
it
is
in
your
conscience
that
i
will
confide
said
he
nevertheless
he
did
not
immediately
speak
out
silence
fell
once
more
the
rain
was
still
streaming
down
the
window
panes
and
gusts
of
wind
howled
along
the
deserted
streets
while
the
flame
of
the
little
lamp
began
to
flare
amid
the
vague
shadows
which
hovered
about
the
quiet
room
marc
gradually
growing
uncomfortable
suffering
from
all
the
abominable
memories
which
that
man
presence
aroused
glanced
anxiously
at
the
door
behind
which
geneviève
must
have
remained
had
she
heard
what
had
been
said
if
so
how
uncomfortable
must
the
stirring
up
of
all
that
old
mud
have
made
her
feel
also
at
last
after
long
remaining
silent
as
if
to
impart
yet
more
solemnity
to
his
confession
brother
gorgias
raised
his
hand
towards
the
ceiling
in
a
dramatic
manner
and
after
a
fresh
interval
said
slowly
in
a
rough
voice
is
true
i
confess
it
before
god
i
entered
little
zéphirin
room
on
the
night
of
the
crime
at
this
although
marc
awaited
the
promised
confession
with
a
good
deal
of
scepticism
expecting
to
hear
merely
some
more
falsehoods
he
was
unable
to
overcome
a
great
shudder
a
feeling
of
horror
which
made
him
spring
to
his
feet
but
gorgias
quietly
motioned
him
to
his
chair
again
entered
the
room
said
he
rather
i
leant
from
outside
on
the
at
about
twenty
minutes
past
ten
before
the
crime
and
that
is
what
i
wished
to
tell
you
in
order
to
relieve
my
conscience
on
leaving
the
capuchin
chapel
that
night
i
undertook
to
escort
little
polydor
to
the
cottage
of
his
father
the
on
the
way
to
jonville
for
fear
of
any
mishap
befalling
the
lad
we
left
the
chapel
at
ten
and
if
i
took
ten
minutes
to
escort
polydor
home
and
ten
minutes
to
return
it
must
you
see
have
been
about
twenty
minutes
past
ten
when
i
again
passed
before
the
school
as
i
crossed
the
little
deserted
square
i
was
surprised
to
see
window
lighted
up
and
wide
open
i
drew
near
and
i
saw
the
dear
child
in
his
nightdress
setting
out
some
religious
prints
which
some
of
his
companions
at
the
first
communion
had
given
him
and
i
scolded
him
for
not
having
closed
his
window
for
the
first
might
easily
have
sprung
into
his
room
but
he
laughed
in
his
pretty
way
and
complained
of
feeling
very
hot
it
was
as
you
must
remember
a
close
and
stormy
night
well
i
was
making
him
promise
that
he
would
do
as
i
told
him
and
go
to
bed
as
soon
as
possible
when
among
the
religious
pictures
set
out
on
his
table
i
saw
a
which
had
come
from
my
class
and
which
was
stamped
and
initialled
by
me
it
made
me
angry
to
see
it
there
and
i
reminded
zéphirin
that
the
boys
were
forbidden
to
take
away
anything
belonging
to
the
school
he
turned
very
red
and
tried
to
excuse
himself
saying
that
he
had
taken
the
slip
home
in
order
to
finish
an
exercise
and
he
asked
me
to
leave
the
slip
with
him
promising
to
bring
it
back
the
next
morning
and
restore
it
to
me
then
he
closed
his
window
and
i
went
off
that
is
the
truth
the
whole
truth
i
swear
it
before
god
marc
who
had
how
recovered
his
calmness
gazed
at
gorgias
fixedly
endeavouring
to
conceal
his
impressions
are
quite
sure
that
the
boy
shut
his
window
when
you
went
away
he
asked
shut
it
and
i
heard
him
putting
up
the
you
still
assert
that
simon
was
guilty
for
nobody
could
have
got
in
from
outside
and
you
hold
that
simon
after
the
crime
opened
the
shutters
again
in
order
to
cast
suspicion
on
some
unknown
prowler
it
is
still
my
opinion
that
simon
was
the
culprit
but
there
is
also
this
chance
that
zéphirin
oppressed
by
the
heat
may
have
opened
the
window
again
after
i
had
gone
marc
was
not
deceived
by
that
supposition
which
was
offered
him
as
a
guide
that
might
lead
to
a
new
fact
he
even
shrugged
his
shoulders
feeling
that
as
gorgias
still
accused
another
of
his
crime
his
pretended
confession
had
little
value
at
the
same
time
however
that
medley
of
fact
and
fiction
cast
just
a
little
more
light
on
the
affair
and
this
marc
desired
to
establish
did
you
not
relate
at
the
assizes
what
you
have
now
stated
he
inquired
great
act
of
injustice
might
then
have
been
avoided
i
did
not
relate
it
gorgias
replied
because
i
should
have
compromised
myself
to
no
good
purpose
my
own
innocence
would
have
been
doubted
and
besides
i
was
then
already
convinced
of
simon
guilt
even
as
i
am
now
and
thus
my
silence
was
quite
natural
moreover
i
repeat
it
i
had
seen
the
lying
on
the
table
only
you
now
admit
that
it
came
from
your
school
and
that
you
had
stamped
and
initialled
it
yourself
you
did
not
always
say
that
remember
those
fools
father
crabot
and
the
others
imposed
a
ridiculous
story
on
me
and
to
prop
up
their
senseless
theory
with
the
help
of
their
grotesque
experts
they
afterwards
invented
the
still
more
foolish
idea
of
a
forged
stamp
for
my
part
i
at
once
desired
to
admit
the
authenticity
of
the
which
was
but
i
had
to
bow
to
their
authority
accept
their
ridiculous
inventions
under
penalty
of
being
abandoned
and
sacrificed
you
saw
how
furious
they
became
before
the
trial
at
rozan
when
i
ended
by
acknowledging
that
the
paraph
was
mine
they
wanted
to
save
that
unfortunate
philibin
they
fancied
they
were
clever
enough
to
spare
the
church
even
the
shadow
of
a
suspicion
and
for
that
very
reason
they
do
not
even
now
forgive
me
for
having
ceased
to
repeat
their
lies
then
marc
noticing
that
gorgias
was
gradually
becoming
exasperated
said
as
if
thinking
aloud
and
by
way
of
spurring
him
on
the
same
it
is
very
strange
that
the
should
have
been
on
the
child
table
why
it
often
happened
that
one
of
the
boys
took
a
slip
away
with
him
little
victor
milhomme
had
taken
one
and
it
was
that
very
circumstance
that
made
you
suspect
the
truth
as
to
the
origin
of
the
slip
but
do
you
still
accuse
me
of
being
the
murderer
do
you
still
believe
that
i
walked
about
with
that
slip
in
my
pocket
come
is
it
reasonable
eh
gorgias
spoke
with
such
jeering
aggressive
violence
his
lips
twitching
the
while
with
that
rictus
which
disclosed
his
wolfish
teeth
that
marc
slightly
lost
countenance
in
spite
of
his
conviction
of
the
brother
guilt
that
slip
which
had
come
nobody
knew
whence
had
always
seemed
to
him
a
very
obscure
feature
of
the
affair
even
as
the
ignorantine
constantly
repeated
it
was
scarcely
likely
that
he
had
carried
the
paper
in
his
pocket
that
evening
on
quitting
the
ceremony
at
the
capuchin
chapel
whence
had
it
come
then
how
was
it
that
gorgias
had
found
it
mingled
with
a
copy
of
petit
marc
felt
that
if
he
had
been
able
to
penetrate
that
mystery
the
whole
affair
would
have
been
perfectly
clear
to
conceal
his
perplexity
he
tried
an
argument
was
necessary
for
you
to
have
the
slip
in
your
pocket
said
he
you
have
said
that
you
saw
it
lying
on
the
table
but
brother
gorgias
had
now
risen
either
yielding
to
his
usual
vehemence
or
playing
some
comedy
in
order
to
end
the
interview
which
was
not
taking
the
course
he
desired
black
and
bent
he
walked
up
and
down
the
shadowy
room
gesticulating
wildly
the
table
yes
of
course
i
saw
it
on
the
table
if
i
say
that
it
is
because
i
have
nothing
to
fear
from
such
an
admission
you
suppose
me
to
be
guilty
but
in
that
case
do
you
imagine
i
should
give
you
a
weapon
by
telling
you
where
i
took
the
slip
we
say
it
was
on
the
table
eh
so
it
would
follow
that
i
took
it
up
and
took
a
newspaper
also
out
of
my
pocket
and
crumpled
it
up
with
the
slip
in
order
to
turn
both
into
a
gag
what
an
operation
eh
at
such
a
moment
how
logical
and
simple
it
would
have
been
but
no
no
if
the
newspaper
was
in
my
pocket
the
slip
must
have
been
there
also
prove
that
it
was
for
otherwise
you
have
nothing
substantial
and
decisive
to
go
upon
and
it
was
in
my
pocket
for
i
saw
it
on
the
table
i
swear
it
again
before
god
wildly
savagely
he
drew
near
to
marc
and
cast
in
his
face
those
words
in
which
one
detected
a
kind
of
audacious
provocation
compounded
of
scraps
of
truth
impudently
set
forth
in
the
shape
of
suppositions
falsehoods
that
barely
masked
the
frightful
scene
which
he
must
have
lived
afresh
with
a
frightful
demoniacal
delight
but
marc
cast
into
disturbing
perplexity
feeling
that
he
would
learn
nothing
useful
from
his
visitor
had
also
decided
to
end
the
interview
said
he
should
i
believe
you
you
come
here
and
you
tell
me
a
tale
which
is
the
third
version
you
have
given
of
the
affair
at
the
outset
you
agreed
with
the
prosecution
the
slip
you
said
belonged
to
the
secular
school
you
did
not
initial
it
it
was
simon
who
had
done
so
in
order
to
cast
his
crime
on
you
then
on
the
discovery
of
the
stamped
corner
torn
off
by
father
philibin
you
felt
it
impossible
to
shelter
yourself
any
longer
behind
the
stupid
report
of
the
experts
you
admitted
that
the
initialling
was
your
work
and
that
the
slip
had
come
from
you
at
present
with
what
motive
i
do
not
know
you
make
a
fresh
confession
to
me
you
assert
that
you
saw
little
zéphirin
in
his
room
a
few
minutes
before
the
crime
that
the
was
then
lying
on
his
table
that
you
scolded
him
and
that
he
closed
his
shutters
well
think
it
over
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
regard
this
version
as
final
i
shall
wait
to
hear
the
plain
truth
if
indeed
it
ever
pleases
you
to
tell
it
pausing
in
his
stormy
perambulations
brother
gorgias
drew
up
his
gaunt
and
tragic
figure
his
eyes
were
blazing
an
evil
laugh
distorted
his
face
once
more
for
a
moment
he
remained
silent
then
in
a
jeering
way
he
said
you
choose
monsieur
froment
i
came
here
in
a
friendly
spirit
to
give
you
some
particulars
about
the
affair
which
still
interests
you
as
you
have
not
renounced
the
hope
of
getting
simon
rehabilitated
you
can
make
use
of
those
particulars
i
authorise
you
to
make
them
known
and
i
ask
you
for
no
thanks
for
i
no
longer
expect
any
gratitude
from
men
then
he
wrapped
himself
in
his
ragged
cloak
and
went
off
as
he
had
come
opening
the
doors
himself
and
giving
never
a
glance
behind
outside
the
icy
rain
was
coming
down
in
furious
squalls
the
wind
filled
the
street
with
its
howls
and
gorgias
vanished
like
a
ghost
into
the
depths
of
the
lugubrious
darkness
geneviève
had
now
opened
the
door
behind
which
she
had
remained
listening
stupefied
by
all
she
had
heard
she
let
her
arms
drop
and
for
a
moment
remained
gazing
at
marc
who
likewise
stood
there
motionless
at
a
loss
whether
to
laugh
or
to
feel
angry
is
mad
my
friend
said
geneviève
i
had
been
in
your
place
i
should
not
have
had
the
patience
to
listen
to
him
so
long
he
lies
as
he
has
always
lied
then
as
marc
seemed
inclined
to
take
things
gaily
she
continued
no
it
is
not
at
all
amusing
the
revival
of
all
those
horrid
things
has
made
me
feel
quite
ill
and
anxious
also
for
i
do
not
understand
what
can
have
been
his
purpose
in
coming
here
why
did
he
make
that
pretended
confession
why
did
he
select
you
to
hear
it
i
think
i
know
my
dear
marc
answered
all
probability
father
crabot
and
the
others
no
longer
give
him
a
copper
that
is
apart
from
some
petty
monthly
allowance
which
they
may
have
arranged
to
make
him
and
as
the
rascal
has
a
huge
appetite
he
tries
to
terrify
them
from
time
to
time
in
order
to
extract
some
big
sum
from
them
i
have
had
information
they
have
done
their
utmost
to
induce
him
to
leave
the
region
twice
already
by
filling
his
pockets
they
have
prevailed
on
him
to
do
so
but
as
soon
as
his
pockets
were
empty
he
came
back
they
dare
not
employ
the
police
in
the
affair
otherwise
the
gendarmes
would
have
rid
them
of
him
long
ago
and
so
once
again
as
they
have
refused
to
let
him
have
more
money
he
wishes
to
give
them
a
good
fright
by
threatening
to
tell
me
everything
and
he
has
told
me
just
a
little
truth
mixed
with
a
great
deal
of
falsehood
in
the
hope
that
i
may
speak
of
it
and
that
the
others
in
their
fright
may
pay
him
well
to
prevent
him
from
telling
me
all
the
rest
this
logical
explanation
restored
the
calmness
of
geneviève
who
merely
added
rest
the
full
plain
truth
he
will
never
tell
it
knows
marc
retorted
craving
for
money
is
great
but
there
is
yet
more
hatred
in
his
heart
and
he
is
courageous
he
would
willingly
risk
his
skin
to
revenge
himself
on
those
old
accomplices
who
have
cowardly
forsaken
him
moreover
in
spite
of
all
his
crimes
he
really
belongs
to
his
deity
of
extermination
he
glows
with
a
sombre
devouring
faith
which
would
prompt
him
to
martyrdom
if
he
only
thought
that
he
might
thereby
win
salvation
and
cast
his
enemies
into
the
torments
of
hell
you
try
to
make
any
use
of
what
he
told
you
geneviève
inquired
i
think
not
i
shall
talk
it
over
with
delbos
but
he
i
know
has
resolved
that
he
will
only
move
when
he
has
a
certainty
to
act
upon
ah
poor
simon
i
despair
of
ever
seeing
him
rehabilitated
i
have
become
so
old
all
at
once
however
the
new
fact
awaited
for
so
many
years
became
manifest
and
marc
then
beheld
the
realisation
of
the
most
ardent
desire
of
his
life
delbos
who
placed
no
faith
in
any
help
from
brother
gorgias
had
set
all
his
hopes
on
the
rozan
medical
man
that
beauchamp
a
juror
at
the
second
trial
to
whom
judge
gragnon
was
said
to
have
made
his
second
illegal
communication
and
who
was
reported
to
be
tortured
by
remorse
this
scent
delbos
followed
with
infinite
patience
having
a
watch
kept
upon
the
doctor
who
preserved
silence
in
compliance
with
the
entreaties
of
his
wife
a
very
pious
and
also
sickly
woman
whose
death
would
probably
have
been
hastened
by
any
scandal
all
at
once
indeed
she
died
and
delbos
then
no
longer
doubted
the
success
of
his
enterprise
it
took
him
another
six
months
to
perfect
his
arrangements
he
managed
to
enter
into
direct
relations
with
beauchamp
whom
he
found
all
anxiety
and
indecision
assailed
by
a
variety
of
scruples
but
at
last
the
doctor
made
up
his
mind
to
hand
the
advocate
a
signed
statement
in
which
he
related
how
one
day
a
friend
acting
on
behalf
of
gragnon
had
shown
him
the
pretended
confession
which
a
workman
dying
at
the
beaumont
hospital
was
said
to
have
made
to
one
of
the
sisters
a
confession
in
which
this
man
acknowledged
that
he
had
engraved
a
false
stamp
for
simon
the
maillebois
schoolmaster
and
beauchamp
added
that
this
secret
communication
alone
had
convinced
him
of
the
guilt
of
simon
whom
previously
he
had
been
disposed
to
acquit
for
lack
of
all
serious
proof
having
secured
this
decisive
statement
delbos
did
not
act
precipitately
he
waited
a
little
longer
he
gathered
together
other
documents
which
showed
that
gragnon
had
communicated
his
extravagant
forgery
to
other
jurors
men
of
the
most
amazing
credulity
equally
extraordinary
was
it
to
find
that
the
judge
had
dared
to
repeat
the
trick
of
beaumont
carrying
a
gross
forgery
in
his
pocket
circulating
it
secretly
through
rozan
exploiting
human
imbecility
with
the
most
sovereign
contempt
and
twice
had
the
trick
succeeded
gragnon
on
the
second
occasion
saving
himself
from
the
galleys
by
sheer
criminal
audacity
he
was
now
beyond
the
reach
of
punishment
for
he
had
lately
died
perishing
miserably
quite
withered
away
his
features
furrowed
it
seemed
by
invisible
claws
and
it
was
certainly
his
death
which
had
induced
beauchamp
to
speak
out
marc
and
david
had
long
thought
that
the
simon
affair
would
be
quite
settled
when
the
personages
compromised
in
it
should
have
disappeared
at
present
magistrate
daix
was
also
dead
while
the
former
procureur
de
la
république
raoul
de
la
bissonnière
had
lately
been
retired
with
the
grant
of
a
commandership
of
the
legion
of
honour
then
counsellor
guybaraud
who
had
presided
at
the
assizes
at
rozan
having
been
stricken
with
hemiplegia
was
passing
away
between
his
confessor
and
a
whereas
pacard
the
who
in
spite
of
a
nasty
story
of
cheating
at
cards
had
managed
to
become
a
public
prosecutor
had
quitted
the
magistracy
to
take
up
somewhat
mysterious
duties
at
rome
as
legal
adviser
to
some
of
the
congregations
again
at
beaumont
there
were
great
changes
in
the
political
administrative
clerical
and
teaching
worlds
other
men
had
succeeded
lemarrois
marcilly
hennebise
bergerot
forbes
and
mauraisin
of
the
direct
accomplices
in
the
crime
father
philibin
had
died
far
away
brother
fulgence
had
disappeared
being
also
dead
perhaps
in
such
wise
that
there
only
remained
father
crabot
the
great
chief
but
even
he
had
withdrawn
from
among
the
living
cloistered
it
was
alleged
in
some
lonely
cell
where
he
was
spending
his
last
years
in
great
penitence
and
thus
there
was
quite
a
new
social
atmosphere
politics
had
altogether
changed
men
passions
were
no
longer
the
same
when
delbos
having
at
last
collected
the
weapons
he
desired
brought
the
affair
forward
once
more
with
masterly
energy
of
recent
years
he
had
risen
to
a
position
of
influence
in
the
chamber
of
deputies
so
he
took
his
documents
straight
to
the
minister
of
justice
and
speedily
prevailed
on
him
to
lay
the
new
fact
before
the
court
of
cassation
it
is
true
that
a
debate
on
the
subject
ensued
the
very
next
day
but
the
minister
contented
himself
with
stating
that
the
matter
was
purely
and
simply
a
legal
one
and
that
the
government
could
not
allow
it
to
be
turned
once
more
into
a
political
question
and
then
amid
the
indifference
with
which
this
old
simon
affair
was
now
regarded
a
vote
of
confidence
in
the
government
was
passed
by
a
considerable
majority
as
for
the
court
of
cassation
which
still
smarted
from
the
smack
it
had
received
at
rozan
it
tried
the
case
with
extraordinary
despatch
purely
and
simply
annulling
the
rozan
verdict
without
sending
simon
before
any
other
tribunal
it
was
all
so
to
say
a
mere
formality
in
three
phrases
everything
was
effaced
and
justice
was
done
at
last
thus
then
in
all
simplicity
the
innocence
of
simon
was
recognised
and
proclaimed
amid
the
pure
glow
of
truth
triumphant
after
so
many
years
of
falsehood
and
of
crime
iii
on
the
morrow
of
the
court
judgment
there
came
an
extraordinary
revival
of
emotion
at
maillebois
there
was
no
surprise
for
those
who
now
believed
in
simon
innocence
were
very
numerous
but
the
material
fact
of
that
decisive
legal
rehabilitation
upset
everybody
and
the
same
thought
came
to
men
of
the
most
varied
views
they
approached
one
another
and
they
said
can
no
possible
reparation
be
offered
to
that
unfortunate
man
who
suffered
so
dreadfully
doubtless
neither
money
nor
honours
of
any
kind
could
indemnify
him
for
his
horrible
martyrdom
but
when
a
whole
people
has
been
guilty
of
such
an
abominable
error
when
it
has
turned
a
into
such
a
pitiable
suffering
creature
it
would
be
good
that
it
should
acknowledge
its
fault
and
confer
some
triumph
on
that
man
by
a
great
act
of
frankness
in
which
truth
and
justice
would
find
recognition
from
that
moment
indeed
the
idea
that
reparation
was
necessary
gained
ground
spreading
by
degrees
through
the
entire
region
one
circumstance
touched
every
heart
while
the
court
of
cassation
was
examining
the
documents
respecting
the
illegal
communication
made
at
rozan
old
lehmann
the
tailor
who
had
reached
his
ninetieth
year
lay
dying
in
that
wretched
house
of
the
rue
du
trou
which
had
been
saddened
by
so
many
tears
and
so
much
mourning
his
daughter
rachel
had
hastened
from
her
pyrenean
retreat
in
order
that
she
might
be
beside
him
at
the
last
hour
but
every
morning
by
some
effort
of
will
the
old
man
seemed
to
revive
being
unwilling
to
die
said
he
so
long
as
justice
should
not
have
been
done
to
the
honour
of
his
and
his
grandchildren
and
indeed
it
was
only
on
the
night
of
the
day
when
the
news
of
the
acquittal
reached
him
that
he
at
last
expired
radiant
with
supreme
joy
after
the
funeral
rachel
immediately
rejoined
simon
and
david
in
their
solitude
where
they
intended
to
remain
for
another
four
or
five
years
when
perhaps
they
might
sell
their
marble
quarry
and
liquidate
their
little
fortune
and
it
so
happened
that
the
old
house
of
the
rue
du
trou
was
now
demolished
a
happy
inspiration
coming
to
the
municipal
council
of
maillebois
to
purify
that
sordid
district
of
the
town
by
carrying
a
broad
thoroughfare
through
it
and
laying
out
a
small
for
the
children
sarah
whose
husband
sébastien
had
now
been
appointed
of
one
of
the
beaumont
schools
had
sold
the
tailoring
business
to
a
madame
savin
a
relative
of
those
savins
who
in
former
times
had
pelted
her
brother
joseph
and
herself
with
stones
and
thus
no
trace
remained
of
the
spot
where
the
simon
family
had
wept
so
bitterly
in
the
distant
days
when
each
letter
arriving
from
the
innocent
prisoner
in
the
penal
settlement
yonder
had
brought
them
fresh
torture
trees
now
grew
there
in
the
sunshine
flowers
shed
their
perfume
beside
the
lawns
and
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
from
that
spot
that
spread
the
covert
remorse
of
maillebois
its
desire
to
repair
the
frightful
iniquity
of
the
past
nevertheless
things
slumbered
for
a
long
time
yet
a
period
of
four
years
went
by
during
which
only
individual
suggestions
were
made
no
general
agreement
being
arrived
at
but
generation
was
following
generation
after
the
children
had
come
the
grandchildren
and
then
the
of
those
who
had
persecuted
simon
in
such
wise
that
quite
a
new
population
ended
by
dwelling
in
maillebois
yet
it
was
necessary
for
the
great
evolution
towards
other
social
conditions
to
be
entirely
accomplished
in
order
that
the
seed
which
had
been
sown
should
yield
a
harvest
of
citizens
freed
from
error
and
falsehood
to
whom
one
might
look
for
a
great
manifestation
of
equity
meantime
life
continued
and
the
valiant
workers
whose
task
was
completed
made
way
for
their
children
marc
and
geneviève
now
nearly
seventy
years
old
retired
and
the
jonville
schools
were
entrusted
to
their
son
clément
and
his
wife
charlotte
hortense
savin
daughter
who
like
himself
had
adopted
the
teaching
profession
mignot
on
his
side
had
quitted
le
moreux
and
retired
to
jonville
in
order
to
be
near
marc
and
geneviève
who
dwelt
in
a
small
house
near
their
old
school
thus
the
village
held
quite
a
little
colony
of
the
first
participators
in
the
great
enterprise
for
salvan
and
mademoiselle
mazeline
were
still
alive
enjoying
a
smiling
and
kindly
old
age
then
at
maillebois
the
boys
school
was
in
the
hands
of
joseph
and
the
girls
school
in
those
of
his
wife
louise
he
was
now
she
two
years
younger
and
they
had
a
big
son
françois
who
in
his
year
had
married
his
cousin
thérèse
the
daughter
of
sébastien
and
sarah
by
whom
he
had
a
beautiful
named
rose
now
barely
a
twelvemonth
old
joseph
and
louise
were
bent
on
never
quitting
maillebois
and
they
gently
chaffed
sébastien
and
sarah
respecting
the
honours
which
awaited
them
for
there
was
now
a
question
of
appointing
sébastien
to
the
directorship
of
the
training
college
where
salvan
had
worked
so
well
as
for
françois
and
thérèse
who
by
hereditary
vocation
had
also
adopted
the
scholastic
profession
they
now
dwelt
at
dherbecourt
where
both
had
become
assistant
teachers
and
what
a
swarming
of
the
sowers
of
truth
there
was
on
certain
sundays
when
the
whole
family
assembled
at
jonville
round
the
grandparents
marc
and
geneviève
and
what
fine
bright
health
was
brought
from
beaumont
by
sébastien
and
sarah
from
maillebois
by
joseph
and
louise
from
dherbecourt
by
françois
and
thérèse
who
came
carrying
their
little
rose
while
at
jonville
they
were
met
by
clément
and
charlotte
who
also
had
a
daughter
lucienne
now
a
big
girl
nearly
seven
years
of
age
and
again
what
a
table
had
to
be
laid
for
that
gathering
of
the
four
generations
particularly
when
their
good
friends
salvan
mignot
and
mademoiselle
mazeline
were
willing
to
join
them
to
drink
to
the
defeat
of
ignorance
the
parent
of
every
evil
and
every
form
of
servitude
the
times
of
human
liberation
which
had
been
so
long
in
coming
which
had
been
awaited
so
feverishly
were
now
being
brought
to
pass
by
sudden
evolutions
a
terrible
blow
had
been
dealt
to
the
church
for
the
last
legislature
had
voted
the
complete
separation
of
church
and
state
and
the
millions
formerly
given
to
the
priests
who
had
employed
them
to
perpetuate
among
the
people
both
hatred
of
the
republic
and
such
abasement
as
was
suited
to
a
flock
kept
merely
to
be
sheared
would
now
be
better
employed
in
doubling
the
salaries
of
the
elementary
schoolmasters
thus
the
situation
was
entirely
changed
the
schoolmaster
ceased
to
be
the
poor
devil
the
varlet
whom
the
peasant
regarded
with
so
much
contempt
when
he
thought
of
the
priest
who
waxed
fat
on
surplice
fees
and
the
presents
of
the
devout
the
priest
ceased
to
be
a
functionary
drawing
pay
from
the
state
revenue
supported
both
by
the
prefect
and
by
the
bishop
and
thus
he
lost
the
respect
of
the
they
no
longer
feared
him
he
was
but
a
kind
of
chance
sacristan
dependent
on
a
few
remaining
believers
who
from
time
to
time
paid
him
for
a
mass
again
the
churches
ceased
to
be
state
institutions
and
became
theatres
run
on
commercial
lines
subsisting
on
the
payments
made
by
the
spectators
the
last
admirers
of
the
ceremonies
performed
in
them
it
was
certain
too
that
before
long
many
would
have
to
close
their
doors
business
already
being
so
bad
with
some
that
they
were
threatened
with
bankruptcy
and
nothing
could
be
more
typical
than
the
position
of
that
terrible
abbé
cognasse
whose
outbursts
of
passion
had
so
long
upset
le
moreux
and
jonville
his
numerous
lawsuits
had
remained
famous
one
could
no
longer
count
the
number
of
times
he
had
been
fined
for
pulling
boys
ears
kicking
women
and
flinging
stones
from
his
garden
wall
upon
those
passers
who
declined
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
nevertheless
he
had
retained
his
office
amid
all
the
worries
brought
upon
him
by
the
citations
he
received
for
he
was
virtually
irremovable
and
exercised
a
paid
state
function
when
however
in
consequence
of
the
separation
of
church
and
state
he
suddenly
became
merely
the
representative
of
an
opinion
a
belief
when
he
ceased
to
receive
state
pay
to
impose
that
belief
on
others
he
lapsed
into
such
nothingness
that
people
no
longer
bowed
to
him
in
a
few
months
time
he
found
himself
almost
alone
in
his
church
with
his
old
servant
palmyre
for
however
much
the
latter
might
pull
the
with
her
shrivelled
arms
only
some
five
or
six
women
still
came
to
mass
a
little
later
there
were
but
three
and
finally
only
one
came
she
fortunately
persevered
and
the
abbé
was
pleased
to
be
able
to
celebrate
the
offices
in
her
presence
for
he
feared
lest
he
should
have
the
same
deplorable
experience
at
jonville
as
he
had
encountered
at
le
moreux
during
a
period
of
three
months
he
had
gone
every
sunday
to
the
latter
village
in
order
to
say
mass
without
even
being
able
to
get
a
child
as
server
so
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
take
his
little
clerk
with
him
from
jonville
and
during
those
three
months
nobody
had
come
to
worship
he
had
officiated
in
solitude
in
the
dank
dark
empty
church
naturally
he
had
ended
by
no
longer
returning
thither
and
at
present
the
closed
church
was
rotting
away
and
falling
into
ruins
when
indeed
one
of
the
functions
of
social
life
disappears
the
building
and
the
man
associated
with
it
become
useless
and
likewise
disappear
and
in
spite
of
the
violent
demeanour
which
abbé
cognasse
still
preserved
his
great
dread
was
that
he
might
see
his
last
parishioner
forsake
him
and
his
church
closed
crumbling
away
amidst
an
invading
growth
of
brambles
footnote
it
will
be
understood
that
in
the
above
passage
zola
anticipates
events
but
it
may
be
remarked
that
the
separation
of
church
and
state
in
france
within
a
few
years
has
never
appeared
more
likely
than
it
does
now
at
maillebois
the
separation
of
church
and
state
had
dealt
a
last
blow
to
the
once
prosperous
school
of
the
christian
brothers
victorious
over
the
secular
school
at
the
time
of
the
simon
case
it
had
fallen
into
increasing
disfavour
as
the
truth
had
gradually
become
manifest
but
with
true
clerical
obstinacy
it
had
been
kept
in
existence
even
when
only
four
and
five
pupils
could
be
recruited
for
it
and
the
new
laws
and
the
dispersion
of
the
community
had
been
needed
to
close
its
doors
the
church
was
now
driven
from
the
national
educational
service
henceforth
to
the
sixteen
hundred
thousand
children
whom
year
by
year
the
congregations
had
poisoned
a
system
of
purely
secular
instruction
was
to
be
applied
and
the
reform
had
spread
from
the
primary
to
the
secondary
establishments
even
the
celebrated
college
of
valmarie
already
weakened
by
the
expulsion
of
the
jesuits
was
stricken
unto
death
by
the
great
work
of
renovation
which
was
in
progress
the
principle
of
integral
and
gratuitous
instruction
for
all
citizens
was
beginning
to
prevail
why
should
there
be
two
frances
why
should
there
be
a
lower
class
doomed
to
ignorance
and
an
upper
class
alone
endowed
with
instruction
and
culture
was
not
this
nonsense
was
it
not
a
fault
a
danger
in
a
democracy
all
of
whose
children
should
be
called
upon
to
increase
the
nation
sum
of
intelligence
and
strength
in
the
near
future
all
the
children
of
france
united
in
a
bond
of
brotherliness
would
begin
their
education
in
the
primary
schools
and
would
thence
pass
into
the
secondary
and
the
superior
schools
according
to
their
aptitudes
their
choice
and
their
tastes
this
was
an
urgent
reform
a
great
work
of
salvation
and
glory
the
necessity
of
which
was
plainly
indicated
by
the
great
contemporary
social
movement
that
downfall
of
the
exhausted
and
the
irresistible
rise
of
the
masses
in
whom
quivered
the
energies
of
henceforth
it
was
on
them
one
would
have
to
draw
and
among
them
as
in
some
huge
reservoir
of
accumulated
force
one
would
find
the
men
of
sense
truth
and
equity
who
in
the
name
of
happiness
and
peace
would
build
the
city
of
the
future
but
as
a
first
step
the
bestowal
of
gratuitous
national
education
on
all
the
children
would
finish
killing
off
those
pretended
free
and
voluntary
schools
those
hotbeds
of
clerical
infection
where
the
only
work
accomplished
was
a
work
of
servitude
and
death
and
after
the
brothers
school
of
maillebois
now
empty
and
long
since
virtually
dead
after
the
college
of
valmarie
whose
buildings
and
grounds
were
shortly
to
be
sold
the
last
religious
communities
would
soon
disappear
together
with
all
their
teaching
establishments
their
factories
of
divers
kinds
and
their
princely
domains
which
represented
millions
of
money
filched
from
human
imbecility
and
expended
to
maintain
the
human
flock
in
subjection
under
the
slaughterer
knife
nevertheless
near
the
dismal
brothers
school
of
maillebois
where
the
shutters
were
closed
and
where
spiders
spun
their
webs
in
the
deserted
classrooms
the
capuchin
community
maintained
its
chapel
dedicated
to
antony
whose
painted
and
gilded
statue
still
stood
there
erect
in
a
place
of
honour
but
in
vain
did
father
théodose
now
very
aged
exert
himself
to
invent
some
more
extraordinary
financial
devices
the
zeal
of
the
masses
was
exhausted
and
only
a
few
old
devotees
occasionally
slipped
pieces
into
the
dusty
it
was
rumoured
indeed
that
the
saint
had
lost
his
power
he
could
no
longer
even
find
lost
things
one
day
too
an
old
woman
actually
climbed
upon
a
chair
in
the
chapel
and
slapped
the
cheeks
of
his
statue
because
instead
of
healing
her
sick
goat
he
had
allowed
the
animal
to
die
briefly
thanks
to
public
good
sense
aroused
at
last
by
the
acquirement
of
a
little
knowledge
one
of
the
basest
of
superstitions
was
dying
meantime
at
the
ancient
and
venerable
parish
church
of
martin
abbé
coquard
encountering
much
the
same
experience
as
abbé
cognasse
at
jonville
found
himself
more
and
more
forsaken
in
such
wise
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
soon
officiate
in
the
solitude
and
darkness
of
a
necropolis
unlike
cognasse
however
he
evinced
no
violence
rigid
gloomy
and
silent
he
seemed
to
be
leading
religion
to
the
grave
preserving
the
while
a
sombre
stubbornness
refusing
to
concede
anything
whatever
to
the
impious
men
of
the
age
in
his
distress
he
more
particularly
sought
refuge
in
the
worship
of
the
sacred
heart
decorating
his
church
with
all
the
flags
which
the
neighbouring
parishes
refused
to
keep
large
red
white
and
blue
flags
on
which
huge
gory
hearts
were
embroidered
in
silk
and
gold
one
of
his
altars
too
was
covered
with
other
hearts
of
metal
porcelain
goffered
leather
and
painted
of
all
sizes
were
these
and
one
might
have
thought
them
just
plucked
from
some
bosom
for
they
seemed
to
be
still
warm
to
palpitate
and
shed
tears
of
blood
in
such
wise
that
the
altar
looked
like
some
butcher
gory
stall
but
that
gross
no
longer
touched
the
masses
which
had
learnt
that
a
people
stricken
by
disaster
raises
itself
afresh
by
work
and
reason
and
not
by
penitence
at
the
feet
of
monstrous
idols
as
religions
grow
old
and
sink
into
carnal
and
base
idolatries
they
seem
to
rot
and
fritter
away
in
mouldiness
if
the
roman
church
however
was
thus
at
the
last
gasp
it
was
as
abbé
quandieu
had
said
because
it
had
virtually
committed
suicide
on
the
day
when
it
had
become
an
upholder
of
iniquity
and
falsehood
how
was
it
that
it
had
not
foreseen
that
by
siding
with
liars
and
forgers
it
must
disappear
with
them
and
share
the
shame
of
their
infamy
on
the
inevitable
day
when
the
innocent
and
the
just
would
triumph
in
the
full
sunlight
its
real
master
was
no
longer
the
jesus
of
innocence
of
gentleness
and
charity
it
had
openly
denied
him
driven
him
from
his
temple
and
all
it
retained
was
that
heart
of
flesh
that
barbarous
fetish
with
which
it
hoped
to
influence
the
sick
nerves
of
the
poor
in
spirit
laden
with
years
and
bitterness
abbé
quandieu
had
lately
passed
away
repeating
have
for
the
second
time
condemned
and
crucified
the
lord
the
church
will
die
of
it
and
dying
it
was
moreover
it
was
not
passing
away
alone
the
aristocratic
and
classes
on
which
it
had
vainly
sought
to
lean
were
collapsing
also
all
the
ancient
noble
and
military
forces
even
the
financial
powers
were
collapsing
stricken
with
madness
and
impotence
since
the
reorganisation
of
the
conditions
of
work
had
been
leading
to
an
equitable
distribution
of
the
national
wealth
some
characteristic
incidents
which
occurred
at
la
désirade
showed
what
a
wretched
fate
fell
on
the
whilom
rich
and
powerful
whose
millions
flowed
away
like
water
hector
de
sanglebœuf
lost
his
seat
in
the
chamber
when
the
electorate
enlightened
and
moralised
by
the
new
schools
at
last
rid
itself
of
all
reactionary
and
violent
representatives
but
a
greater
misfortune
was
the
death
of
the
marchioness
de
boise
that
intelligent
and
woman
who
had
so
long
promoted
prosperity
and
peace
at
la
désirade
when
she
was
gone
the
vain
and
foolish
sanglebœuf
went
altogether
wrong
becoming
a
gambler
losing
huge
sums
at
play
and
descending
to
ignoble
amours
with
the
result
that
he
was
one
day
brought
home
beaten
unmercifully
so
battered
indeed
that
three
days
later
he
died
no
complaint
however
being
lodged
with
the
authorities
for
fear
of
all
the
mud
which
would
soil
his
memory
if
the
real
facts
of
his
death
were
brought
to
light
his
wife
the
once
beautiful
and
indolent
léa
the
pious
and
ever
sleepy
marie
of
later
times
then
remained
alone
amid
the
splendours
of
that
large
estate
when
her
father
baron
nathan
the
millionaire
jew
banker
suddenly
died
after
being
confined
by
paralysis
to
his
sumptuous
mansion
in
the
champs
élysées
he
had
long
ceased
to
see
her
and
he
left
her
as
little
as
possible
of
his
fortune
slices
of
which
had
already
gone
to
all
sorts
of
aristocratic
charitable
enterprises
and
even
to
certain
ladies
of
society
who
during
the
final
years
of
his
life
had
procured
him
the
illusion
of
imagining
that
he
had
become
really
one
of
their
set
and
was
quite
cleansed
of
all
his
jewry
however
his
supine
and
indolent
daughter
who
had
never
known
a
passion
in
her
life
not
even
one
for
money
paid
due
honour
to
his
memory
even
ordering
masses
to
be
said
for
his
soul
by
way
of
compelling
heaven
to
admit
him
within
its
precincts
for
as
she
often
repeated
he
had
rendered
quite
enough
services
to
catholicism
to
be
entitled
to
a
place
on
the
deity
right
hand
and
now
having
no
children
léa
led
a
lonely
life
at
la
désirade
which
remained
empty
and
deathly
enclosed
on
every
side
by
walls
and
railings
which
shut
out
the
public
as
if
it
were
some
forbidden
paradise
yet
there
were
rumours
to
the
effect
that
on
the
closing
of
the
college
of
valmarie
the
countess
had
granted
an
asylum
to
her
old
friend
father
crabot
who
had
now
reached
a
very
great
age
his
removal
to
la
désirade
was
said
by
some
to
be
a
mere
change
of
cell
for
in
an
ascetic
spirit
he
was
content
to
occupy
a
little
garret
formerly
assigned
to
a
servant
and
furnished
with
merely
an
iron
bedstead
a
deal
table
and
a
chair
but
he
none
the
less
reigned
over
the
estate
as
if
he
were
its
sovereign
master
the
only
visitors
being
a
few
priests
and
other
clerics
who
came
to
take
counsel
of
him
and
whose
gowns
might
be
seen
occasionally
gliding
between
the
clumps
of
verdure
or
past
the
marble
basins
and
their
plashing
waters
though
his
ninetieth
year
was
past
crabot
ever
a
conqueror
of
women
a
bewitcher
of
pious
souls
repeated
the
triumphant
stroke
of
his
earlier
days
he
had
lost
valmarie
that
royal
gift
which
he
had
owed
to
the
love
of
the
countess
de
quédeville
but
he
won
la
désirade
from
the
good
grace
of
that
léa
whom
he
so
fervently
called
sister
marie
in
jesus
christ
as
manager
and
almoner
he
set
his
hands
on
her
fortune
financing
all
sorts
of
religious
enterprises
and
subscribing
lavishly
to
the
funds
which
the
reactionary
parties
established
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
on
their
desperate
campaign
against
the
republic
and
its
institutions
and
thus
when
the
countess
was
found
dead
on
her
couch
one
evening
looking
as
if
in
her
indolence
she
had
just
fallen
asleep
she
was
ruined
her
millions
had
all
passed
into
the
of
the
black
band
and
there
only
remained
the
estate
of
la
désirade
which
was
willed
to
father
crabot
on
the
one
condition
that
he
should
there
establish
some
such
christian
enterprise
as
he
might
choose
to
select
but
these
were
merely
the
last
convulsions
of
an
expiring
world
all
maillebois
was
now
passing
into
the
hands
of
those
socialists
whom
the
pious
dames
of
other
times
had
pictured
as
bandits
and
footpads
that
whilom
clerical
centre
had
now
gone
so
completely
over
to
the
cause
of
reason
that
not
a
single
reactionary
member
remained
in
its
municipal
council
both
philis
once
the
priests
mayor
and
darras
the
traitors
mayor
were
dead
and
the
latter
who
was
remembered
as
a
man
of
weak
timorous
hesitating
mind
had
been
replaced
by
a
mayor
of
great
good
sense
and
industrious
energy
this
being
jules
savin
the
younger
brother
of
the
twins
those
mediocrities
achille
and
philippe
jules
after
marrying
a
peasant
girl
named
rosalie
bonin
had
worked
most
courageously
in
fifteen
years
establishing
an
admirable
model
farm
which
had
revolutionised
the
agricultural
methods
of
the
region
and
greatly
increased
its
wealth
he
was
now
barely
more
than
forty
years
old
and
rather
stubborn
by
nature
for
he
only
yielded
to
substantial
arguments
which
tended
to
the
general
good
and
it
was
under
his
presidency
that
the
municipal
council
at
last
found
itself
called
upon
to
examine
a
scheme
for
offering
some
public
reparation
to
simon
that
idea
which
had
slumbered
for
a
few
years
and
which
now
awoke
once
more
the
subject
had
frequently
been
mentioned
to
marc
who
indeed
could
never
come
to
maillebois
without
encountering
somebody
who
spoke
to
him
about
it
in
this
respect
he
was
particularly
moved
one
day
when
he
happened
to
meet
adrien
doloir
a
son
of
his
former
pupil
auguste
by
his
wife
angèle
adrien
after
studying
successfully
under
joulic
had
become
an
architect
of
great
merit
and
though
barely
eight
and
twenty
years
of
age
had
been
lately
elected
to
the
municipal
council
of
which
indeed
he
was
the
youngest
member
one
whose
schemes
were
said
to
be
somewhat
bold
though
none
the
less
practical
my
dear
monsieur
froment
how
pleased
i
am
to
meet
you
he
exclaimed
as
he
accosted
marc
so
happens
that
i
wished
to
go
over
to
jonville
to
speak
to
you
like
all
the
young
men
of
the
new
generation
who
loved
and
venerated
marc
as
a
patriarch
as
one
of
the
great
workers
of
the
heroic
times
adrien
addressed
him
most
deferentially
standing
uncovered
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
personally
he
had
only
been
a
pupil
of
marc
for
a
very
brief
period
when
he
was
very
young
indeed
but
his
brother
and
his
uncles
had
all
grown
up
in
the
old
master
class
do
you
desire
of
me
my
dear
lad
inquired
marc
who
felt
both
brightened
and
moved
whenever
he
met
any
of
his
former
boys
or
their
children
it
is
like
this
can
you
tell
me
if
it
is
true
that
the
simon
family
will
soon
return
to
maillebois
it
is
said
that
simon
and
his
brother
david
have
decided
to
quit
the
pyrenees
and
settle
here
again
is
it
true
you
must
be
well
acquainted
with
their
views
is
certainly
their
intention
marc
responded
with
his
pleasant
smile
i
do
not
think
one
can
expect
them
till
next
year
for
though
they
have
found
a
purchaser
for
their
marble
quarry
they
are
to
carry
it
on
for
another
twelvemonth
besides
a
variety
of
matters
will
have
to
be
settled
and
they
themselves
can
not
yet
tell
exactly
how
and
when
they
will
install
themselves
here
if
we
have
only
a
year
before
us
exclaimed
adrien
with
sudden
excitement
shall
barely
have
the
necessary
time
for
the
realisation
of
a
plan
i
have
formed
i
wish
to
submit
it
to
you
before
doing
anything
decisive
what
day
would
be
convenient
for
me
to
call
on
you
at
jonville
marc
who
intended
to
spend
the
day
at
maillebois
with
his
daughter
louise
pointed
out
that
it
would
be
preferable
to
profit
by
this
opportunity
and
adrien
assenting
it
was
eventually
arranged
that
he
should
call
at
the
latter
house
in
the
afternoon
this
house
was
a
pleasant
dwelling
built
by
adrien
himself
on
one
of
the
fields
of
the
farm
which
had
belonged
to
the
old
bongards
in
the
outskirts
of
maillebois
they
had
long
been
dead
and
the
property
had
remained
in
the
hands
of
fernand
the
father
of
claire
to
whom
adrien
was
married
thus
many
memories
arose
in
marc
mind
when
with
a
still
firm
and
brave
step
he
walked
past
the
old
on
his
way
to
the
architect
little
house
had
he
not
repaired
to
that
same
spot
forty
years
previously
on
the
very
day
indeed
of
arrest
with
the
object
of
collecting
information
in
his
favour
in
imagination
marc
again
accosted
bongard
the
stoutly
built
and
peasant
and
his
bony
and
suspicious
wife
and
found
them
both
stubbornly
determined
to
say
nothing
for
fear
lest
they
might
compromise
themselves
he
well
remembered
that
he
had
been
unable
to
extract
anything
from
them
incapable
as
they
were
of
any
act
of
justice
since
they
knew
nothing
and
would
learn
nothing
being
so
to
say
only
so
much
brute
matter
steeped
in
a
thick
layer
of
ignorance
with
a
sigh
marc
passed
on
and
rang
at
the
gate
of
adrien
house
the
young
architect
was
awaiting
him
under
an
old
apple
tree
whose
strong
branches
laden
with
fruit
sheltered
a
few
garden
chairs
and
a
table
master
adrien
exclaimed
an
honour
you
do
me
by
coming
to
sit
here
for
a
little
while
but
i
have
another
favour
to
ask
of
you
you
must
kiss
my
little
georgette
for
it
will
bring
her
good
luck
beside
adrien
was
claire
his
wife
a
smiling
blonde
scarcely
in
her
year
with
a
limpid
face
and
eyes
all
intelligence
and
kindness
it
was
she
who
presented
the
little
girl
a
pretty
child
fair
like
her
mother
and
already
very
knowing
for
her
five
years
must
remember
my
treasure
that
monsieur
froment
has
kissed
you
for
it
will
make
you
glorious
all
your
life
i
know
mamma
i
often
hear
you
talk
of
him
said
georgette
is
as
if
a
little
of
the
sun
came
down
to
see
me
at
this
the
others
began
to
laugh
but
all
at
once
claire
father
and
mother
fernand
bongard
and
his
wife
lucille
made
their
appearance
having
heard
that
the
old
schoolmaster
intended
to
call
and
wishing
to
show
him
some
politeness
although
fernand
with
his
hard
nut
had
been
anything
but
a
satisfactory
pupil
in
bygone
years
marc
was
pleased
to
see
him
once
more
the
farmer
now
near
his
fiftieth
year
still
looked
very
dull
and
heavy
as
if
he
were
scarcely
awake
and
his
manner
remained
an
uneasy
one
fernand
marc
said
to
him
ought
to
be
pleased
this
has
been
a
good
year
for
the
grain
crops
monsieur
froment
there
some
truth
in
that
but
the
never
a
really
good
one
when
things
go
well
in
one
respect
they
go
badly
in
another
and
besides
i
never
had
any
luck
you
know
his
wife
whose
mind
was
sharper
than
his
thereupon
ventured
to
intervene
says
that
monsieur
froment
because
he
always
used
to
be
the
last
of
his
class
and
because
he
imagines
that
a
spell
was
cast
on
him
by
some
gipsy
when
he
was
quite
a
little
child
a
spell
indeed
as
if
there
were
any
sense
in
such
an
idea
it
would
be
different
if
he
believed
in
the
devil
for
there
is
a
devil
sure
enough
mademoiselle
rouzaire
whose
best
pupil
i
was
showed
him
to
me
one
day
a
short
time
before
my
first
communion
then
as
claire
made
merry
over
this
statement
and
even
little
georgette
laughed
very
irreverently
at
the
idea
of
there
being
any
such
thing
as
a
devil
lucille
continued
i
know
that
you
believe
in
nothing
none
of
the
young
folks
of
nowadays
have
any
religious
principles
left
mademoiselle
mazeline
made
women
of
you
all
nevertheless
one
evening
as
i
well
remember
mademoiselle
rouzaire
showed
us
a
shadow
passing
over
the
wall
and
told
us
it
was
the
devil
and
it
was
indeed
adrien
somewhat
embarrassed
by
his
chatter
now
interrupted
her
and
addressed
marc
on
the
subject
of
his
visit
they
had
all
seated
themselves
claire
taking
georgette
on
her
lap
while
her
father
and
mother
kept
a
little
apart
from
the
others
the
former
smoking
his
pipe
and
the
latter
knitting
a
stocking
master
this
is
the
question
said
adrien
young
people
of
the
district
feel
that
great
dishonour
will
rest
on
the
name
of
maillebois
as
long
as
the
town
has
not
repaired
as
well
as
it
can
the
frightful
iniquity
which
it
allowed
and
in
which
indeed
it
became
an
accomplice
when
simon
was
condemned
his
legal
acquittal
does
not
suffice
for
us
the
children
and
grandchildren
of
the
persecutors
it
is
a
duty
to
confess
and
efface
the
transgression
of
our
forerunners
yesterday
evening
at
my
father
house
on
seeing
my
grandfather
and
my
uncles
there
i
again
asked
them
how
was
it
that
you
ever
allowed
such
stupid
and
monstrous
iniquity
when
the
exercise
of
a
little
reason
ought
to
have
sufficed
to
prevent
it
and
as
usual
they
made
vague
gestures
and
answered
that
they
did
not
know
that
they
could
not
know
silence
fell
and
all
eyes
turned
towards
fernand
who
belonged
to
the
incriminated
generations
but
he
likewise
rid
himself
of
the
question
by
taking
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
gesticulating
in
an
embarrassed
way
while
he
remarked
to
be
sure
we
did
know
how
could
we
have
known
my
father
and
mother
could
scarcely
sign
their
names
and
they
were
not
so
imprudent
as
to
meddle
in
their
neighbours
affairs
for
they
might
have
got
punished
for
it
and
though
i
had
learnt
rather
more
than
they
had
i
was
learned
by
any
means
and
so
i
distrusted
the
whole
business
for
a
man
does
not
care
to
risk
his
skin
and
his
money
when
he
feels
he
is
ignorant
to
you
young
men
nowadays
it
seems
very
easy
to
be
brave
and
wise
because
you
been
well
taught
but
i
should
have
liked
to
have
seen
you
as
we
were
with
no
means
of
telling
right
from
wrong
with
our
minds
at
sea
amid
a
lot
of
affairs
in
which
nobody
could
distinguish
anything
certain
true
said
lucille
never
thought
myself
a
fool
but
all
the
same
i
could
not
understand
much
of
that
business
and
i
tried
not
to
think
of
it
for
my
mother
was
always
repeating
that
poor
folk
ought
not
to
meddle
with
the
affairs
of
the
rich
unless
they
wanted
to
get
poorer
still
marc
had
listened
with
silent
gravity
all
the
past
came
back
he
heard
old
bongard
and
his
wife
refuse
to
answer
him
like
the
illiterate
peasants
they
were
whose
one
desire
was
to
continue
toiling
and
moiling
in
quietude
and
he
also
remembered
fernand
demeanour
on
the
morrow
of
the
trial
at
rozan
when
he
had
still
shrugged
his
shoulders
still
persisted
in
his
desire
to
know
nothing
how
many
years
and
what
prolonged
teaching
of
human
reason
and
civic
courage
had
been
needed
before
a
new
generation
had
at
last
opened
its
eyes
to
truth
dared
to
recognise
and
admit
it
and
as
marc
looked
at
fernand
he
began
to
nod
as
if
to
say
that
he
thought
the
farmer
excuses
good
ones
for
he
was
already
inclined
to
forgive
those
persecutors
whose
ignorance
had
been
the
chief
cause
of
their
crime
and
he
ended
by
smiling
at
georgette
in
whom
on
the
other
hand
the
future
seemed
to
be
flowering
as
she
sat
there
with
her
beautiful
eyes
wide
open
and
her
keen
ears
on
the
alert
waiting
one
might
have
thought
for
some
fine
story
so
master
adrien
resumed
plan
is
a
very
simple
one
as
you
are
aware
some
great
improvements
have
been
effected
at
maillebois
lately
with
the
view
of
rendering
the
old
quarter
of
the
town
more
salubrious
an
avenue
has
replaced
those
sewers
the
rue
plaisir
and
the
rue
fauche
while
on
the
site
of
the
filthy
rue
du
trou
is
a
which
the
children
of
the
neighbourhood
fill
with
their
play
and
their
laughter
well
among
the
building
land
in
front
of
that
square
is
the
very
spot
on
which
stood
old
lehmann
wretched
house
that
house
of
mourning
which
our
forerunners
used
to
stone
it
is
my
idea
then
to
propose
to
the
municipal
council
the
erection
of
a
new
house
on
that
site
not
a
palace
but
a
modest
bright
cheerful
dwelling
which
might
be
offered
to
simon
so
that
he
might
end
his
days
in
it
encompassed
by
the
respect
and
affection
of
everybody
the
gift
would
have
no
great
pecuniary
value
it
would
simply
represent
delicate
and
brotherly
homage
tears
had
risen
to
the
eyes
of
marc
who
was
greatly
touched
by
the
kind
thought
thus
bestowed
on
his
old
friend
the
persecuted
innocent
man
you
approve
of
my
idea
inquired
adrien
who
on
his
side
was
stirred
by
the
sight
of
marc
emotion
the
old
schoolmaster
rose
and
embraced
him
my
lad
i
approve
of
it
and
i
owe
you
one
of
the
greatest
joys
of
my
life
you
master
but
that
is
not
everything
wait
a
moment
i
wish
to
show
you
a
plan
of
the
house
which
i
have
already
prepared
for
i
should
like
to
direct
the
work
gratuitously
and
i
feel
certain
that
i
should
find
contractors
and
men
prepared
to
undertake
the
building
at
very
low
rates
he
withdrew
for
a
moment
and
on
returning
with
the
plan
he
spread
it
out
upon
the
under
the
old
apple
tree
and
everybody
approached
and
leant
over
to
examine
it
the
house
such
as
it
had
been
depicted
was
indeed
a
very
simple
but
also
a
very
pleasant
one
two
storeys
high
with
a
white
frontage
and
a
garden
enclosed
by
some
iron
railings
above
the
entrance
a
marble
slab
was
figured
there
to
be
an
inscription
then
marc
inquired
the
house
is
intended
for
one
this
is
what
i
shall
suggest
to
the
council
presented
by
the
town
of
maillebois
to
schoolmaster
simon
in
the
name
of
truth
and
justice
and
in
reparation
for
the
torture
inflicted
on
him
and
the
whole
will
be
signed
the
grandchildren
of
his
persecutors
with
gestures
of
protest
and
anxiety
fernand
and
lucille
glanced
at
their
daughter
claire
surely
that
was
going
too
far
she
must
not
let
her
husband
compromise
himself
to
such
a
point
but
claire
who
was
leaning
lovingly
against
adrien
shoulder
smiled
and
responded
to
the
consternation
of
her
parents
by
saying
helped
to
prepare
the
inscription
monsieur
froment
i
should
like
that
to
be
known
i
will
make
it
known
you
may
depend
on
it
marc
answered
gaily
the
inscription
must
be
accepted
and
first
of
all
there
is
the
question
of
the
house
so
replied
adrien
wished
to
show
you
my
plan
with
the
view
of
securing
your
approval
and
help
the
question
of
the
expense
will
hardly
affect
the
council
i
am
more
apprehensive
of
certain
scruples
some
last
attempts
at
resistance
inspired
by
the
old
spirit
though
the
members
of
the
council
are
nowadays
all
convinced
of
innocence
some
of
them
are
timid
men
who
will
only
yield
to
the
force
of
public
opinion
and
our
mayor
jules
savin
has
said
to
me
truly
enough
that
it
is
essential
the
scheme
should
be
voted
unanimously
on
the
day
it
is
brought
forward
then
as
a
fresh
idea
occurred
to
him
adrien
added
you
know
master
as
you
have
been
good
enough
to
come
so
far
you
ought
to
cap
your
kindness
by
accompanying
me
to
jules
savin
at
once
he
was
a
pupil
of
yours
and
i
feel
certain
that
our
cause
would
make
great
progress
if
you
would
only
have
a
short
chat
with
him
will
do
so
willingly
marc
answered
us
start
i
will
go
wherever
you
like
fernand
and
lucille
protested
no
longer
she
had
returned
to
her
knitting
while
he
pulling
at
his
pipe
relapsed
into
the
indifference
of
a
dullard
unable
to
understand
the
new
times
claire
however
suddenly
had
to
defend
the
plan
from
the
enterprising
hands
of
little
georgette
who
wished
to
appropriate
pretty
picture
then
as
marc
and
adrien
made
ready
to
go
there
came
more
embraces
handshakes
and
laughter
the
farm
of
les
amettes
where
jules
savin
resided
was
on
the
other
side
of
maillebois
and
in
order
to
reach
it
marc
and
the
young
architect
had
to
pass
the
new
for
a
moment
therefore
they
paused
before
the
plot
of
land
on
which
the
architect
proposed
to
build
the
projected
house
see
said
he
the
requirements
for
a
house
will
be
found
united
here
but
he
broke
off
on
seeing
a
stout
and
smiling
man
approach
him
here
uncle
charles
he
exclaimed
say
uncle
when
we
build
the
house
for
simon
the
martyr
which
i
have
told
you
about
you
will
undertake
to
provide
all
the
locksmith
work
at
cost
price
will
you
not
i
do
mind
my
boy
if
it
pleases
you
said
charles
doloir
i
do
it
also
for
your
sake
monsieur
froment
for
it
pains
me
at
times
to
think
of
how
i
used
to
worry
you
charles
after
marrying
marthe
dupuis
his
employer
daughter
had
for
a
long
time
been
managing
the
business
he
had
a
son
named
marcel
who
was
about
the
same
age
as
adrien
and
who
having
married
a
daughter
laure
dumont
had
become
a
contractor
for
house
carpentry
am
going
to
your
father
charles
resumed
addressing
his
nephew
have
an
appointment
with
marcel
about
some
work
come
with
me
for
if
you
build
this
house
you
will
have
some
work
to
give
them
as
well
and
you
will
come
also
monsieur
froment
it
will
please
you
perhaps
to
meet
some
more
of
your
old
pupils
indeed
it
will
marc
answered
gaily
we
shall
be
able
to
settle
the
specifications
specifications
oh
we
have
not
got
to
that
point
yet
adrien
retorted
my
father
is
an
enthusiast
but
no
matter
i
go
to
see
him
auguste
doloir
thanks
to
the
friendly
protection
of
darras
the
former
mayor
had
become
a
building
contractor
in
a
small
way
after
his
father
death
he
had
taken
his
mother
to
live
with
him
and
since
the
demolition
of
the
rue
plaisir
he
had
been
residing
in
the
new
avenue
where
he
occupied
a
ground
floor
flanked
by
a
large
yard
in
which
he
stored
some
of
his
materials
the
lodging
was
very
clean
very
healthy
and
full
of
sunlight
when
marc
found
himself
in
the
bright
face
to
face
with
madame
doloir
the
elder
some
more
memories
of
the
past
returned
to
him
the
old
woman
now
years
old
had
retained
the
demeanour
of
a
good
and
prudent
housewife
one
who
was
instinctively
conservative
and
allowed
neither
her
husband
nor
her
children
to
compromise
themselves
by
dabbling
in
politics
marc
also
recalled
her
husband
doloir
the
mason
that
big
fair
ignorant
fellow
in
his
way
but
spoilt
by
haunted
as
he
was
by
idiotic
notions
of
the
army
being
disorganised
by
those
who
knew
no
country
and
of
france
being
sold
to
the
foreigners
by
the
jews
one
day
unfortunately
he
had
been
brought
home
dead
on
a
stretcher
after
falling
from
a
scaffolding
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
been
drinking
previously
though
madame
doloir
would
not
acknowledge
it
for
she
was
one
of
those
who
never
admit
the
existence
of
family
failings
on
perceiving
marc
she
at
once
said
to
him
monsieur
we
are
no
longer
young
we
are
very
old
acquaintances
indeed
auguste
and
charles
were
not
more
than
eight
and
six
years
old
when
i
first
saw
you
so
madame
i
well
remember
it
i
called
on
you
on
behalf
of
my
colleague
simon
to
ask
you
to
let
your
boys
tell
the
truth
if
they
should
be
questioned
at
this
though
the
case
was
now
such
a
very
old
one
madame
doloir
became
grave
and
suspicious
affair
was
no
concern
of
ours
she
answered
i
acted
rightly
in
refusing
to
let
it
enter
our
home
for
it
did
great
harm
to
many
people
charles
however
perceiving
his
brother
auguste
in
the
yard
with
marcel
ready
for
the
appointment
now
called
him
into
the
room
here
a
moment
i
brought
somebody
to
see
you
besides
your
son
adrien
is
here
and
wants
to
give
us
an
order
auguste
who
was
as
tall
and
sturdy
as
his
father
had
been
pressed
marc
hand
vigorously
monsieur
froment
said
he
often
talk
about
you
charles
and
i
when
we
remember
our
i
was
a
very
bad
pupil
and
i
regretted
it
at
times
yet
i
hope
i
disgraced
you
too
much
and
in
any
case
my
son
adrien
is
becoming
a
man
after
your
own
heart
then
he
added
laughing
know
what
adrien
order
is
yes
indeed
the
house
which
he
wants
to
build
for
your
friend
simon
all
the
same
a
house
is
perhaps
a
good
deal
to
give
to
an
in
spite
of
the
bantering
of
auguste
tone
marc
felt
grieved
by
that
last
remark
you
still
think
simon
guilty
he
inquired
one
time
you
became
convinced
of
his
innocence
but
you
began
to
doubt
it
again
after
that
monstrous
trial
at
rozan
of
course
monsieur
froment
one
feels
impressed
when
a
man
is
found
guilty
by
two
juries
in
succession
but
no
i
no
longer
say
that
he
was
the
culprit
and
besides
at
bottom
it
is
all
one
to
us
we
are
even
quite
willing
that
a
present
should
be
made
to
him
if
by
that
means
the
affair
can
be
brought
to
an
end
once
and
for
all
so
that
we
shall
never
have
it
dinned
into
our
ears
again
is
that
so
brother
correct
responded
charles
those
big
fellows
were
listened
to
we
ourselves
should
be
the
only
real
criminals
on
the
ground
that
we
tolerated
the
injustice
it
vexes
me
there
must
be
an
end
to
it
all
the
two
cousins
adrien
and
marcel
who
took
an
equally
passionate
interest
in
the
affair
laughed
triumphantly
it
is
settled
exclaimed
marcel
as
he
tapped
his
father
on
the
shoulder
will
take
charge
of
the
locksmith
work
uncle
auguste
of
the
masonry
and
i
of
the
timber
work
in
that
way
your
share
in
the
crime
as
you
put
it
will
be
repaired
and
we
will
never
mention
the
matter
to
you
again
we
swear
it
adrien
was
laughing
and
nodding
his
approval
when
old
madame
doloir
who
had
remained
standing
there
stiff
and
silent
intervened
in
her
obstinate
way
and
charles
said
she
nothing
to
repair
it
will
never
be
known
whether
schoolmaster
simon
was
guilty
or
not
we
little
folk
ought
never
to
poke
our
noses
into
affairs
which
only
concern
the
government
and
i
pity
you
boys
yes
both
of
you
adrien
and
marcel
if
you
imagine
that
you
are
strong
enough
to
change
things
you
fancy
that
you
now
know
everything
whereas
you
know
nothing
at
all
for
instance
my
poor
dead
husband
your
grandfather
knew
that
a
general
meeting
of
all
the
jew
millionaires
was
held
in
paris
in
a
subterranean
gallery
near
the
fortifications
every
saturday
when
it
was
decided
what
sums
should
be
paid
to
the
traitors
who
betrayed
france
to
germany
and
he
knew
the
story
to
be
a
true
one
for
it
had
been
told
him
by
his
own
captain
who
vouched
for
it
on
his
honour
marc
gazed
at
the
old
woman
in
wonderment
for
it
was
as
if
he
had
been
carried
forty
years
back
he
recognised
in
her
tale
one
of
those
extraordinary
stories
which
doloir
the
mason
had
picked
up
while
he
was
soldiering
for
their
part
auguste
and
charles
had
listened
to
the
anecdote
in
quite
a
serious
way
without
any
sign
of
embarrassment
for
it
was
amid
similar
imbecilities
that
they
had
spent
their
childhood
but
neither
adrien
nor
marcel
could
refrain
from
smiling
however
great
might
be
their
affectionate
deference
for
their
grandmother
jew
syndicate
in
a
cellar
ah
what
an
idea
grandmother
said
adrien
softly
are
no
more
jews
for
there
will
soon
be
no
more
catholics
the
disappearance
of
the
churches
means
the
end
of
all
religious
warfare
then
as
his
mother
now
came
into
the
room
he
went
to
kiss
her
angèle
bongard
who
had
married
auguste
doloir
when
a
shrewd
young
peasant
girl
had
largely
contributed
to
her
husband
success
though
she
had
no
very
exceptional
gifts
she
now
at
once
asked
for
news
of
her
brother
fernand
her
lucille
and
their
daughter
claire
who
had
married
her
son
then
the
whole
family
became
interested
in
the
latest
addition
to
its
number
this
being
a
named
célestin
to
whom
marcel
wife
had
given
birth
a
fortnight
previously
see
monsieur
froment
remarked
old
madame
doloir
have
become
a
for
the
second
time
after
georgette
has
come
this
little
fellow
célestin
my
younger
son
léon
also
has
a
big
boy
edmond
now
twelve
years
old
but
he
is
only
my
grandson
so
with
him
i
do
seem
to
be
quite
so
old
the
old
woman
was
becoming
amiable
anxious
it
seemed
to
efface
the
recollection
of
her
former
stiffness
for
she
continued
by
the
way
monsieur
froment
we
never
seem
to
agree
but
there
is
one
thing
for
which
i
really
have
to
thank
you
and
that
is
for
having
almost
compelled
me
to
make
léon
a
schoolmaster
i
did
care
for
that
profession
for
it
seemed
to
me
hardly
a
tempting
one
but
you
took
all
sorts
of
pains
you
gave
lessons
to
léon
and
now
though
he
not
yet
forty
he
already
has
a
good
position
she
had
become
indeed
very
proud
of
her
youngest
son
léon
who
had
lately
succeeded
sébastien
milhomme
in
the
headmastership
of
a
school
at
beaumont
sébastien
having
been
appointed
director
of
the
training
college
the
schoolmistress
whom
léon
had
married
juliette
hochard
had
also
been
transferred
to
beaumont
there
taking
the
former
post
of
mademoiselle
rouzaire
and
their
eldest
son
edmond
now
a
pupil
at
the
lycée
was
studying
brilliantly
well
pleased
at
seeing
his
grandmother
so
amiable
with
marc
adrien
kissed
her
and
then
said
jestingly
very
nice
of
you
grandmother
you
are
now
on
monsieur
froment
side
and
do
you
know
on
the
day
when
simon
returns
we
will
choose
you
to
offer
him
a
bouquet
at
the
railway
station
but
she
again
became
grave
and
suspicious
no
not
that
certainly
not
i
do
want
to
get
myself
into
trouble
you
young
men
are
mad
with
your
new
ideas
after
a
merry
adrien
and
marc
at
last
retired
in
order
to
make
their
way
to
jules
savin
the
model
farm
of
les
amettes
spread
over
some
two
hundred
and
fifty
acres
in
the
outskirts
of
maillebois
just
beyond
the
new
district
jules
after
his
death
had
given
a
home
to
his
father
the
former
petty
clerk
who
was
now
years
old
and
he
had
been
obliged
to
do
the
same
for
his
elder
brother
achille
one
of
the
twins
who
after
being
for
many
years
a
clerk
like
his
father
had
been
suddenly
stricken
with
paralysis
philippe
the
other
twin
and
at
one
time
the
partner
of
jules
was
now
dead
it
so
happened
that
marc
had
become
a
connection
of
this
family
by
reason
of
the
marriage
of
his
son
clément
with
charlotte
the
daughter
of
hortense
savin
who
had
died
some
years
previously
but
the
marriage
had
taken
place
somewhat
against
marc
desires
and
thus
while
allowing
clément
all
latitude
to
follow
the
dictates
of
his
heart
he
had
preferred
personally
to
hold
aloof
he
was
too
to
make
charlotte
responsible
for
the
flighty
conduct
of
her
mother
who
after
being
led
astray
in
her
sixteenth
year
and
marrying
her
seducer
had
ended
by
eloping
with
another
lover
meeting
at
last
with
a
wretched
death
in
some
other
part
of
france
and
thus
while
imputing
nothing
to
her
daughter
marc
harboured
certain
prejudices
against
the
savin
family
generally
and
whatever
alacrity
he
had
professed
it
had
been
necessary
for
him
to
do
violence
to
his
feelings
when
adrien
had
begged
him
to
go
to
les
amettes
as
it
happened
jules
was
not
at
home
but
his
return
was
expected
every
moment
in
the
meantime
the
visitors
found
themselves
in
the
presence
of
savin
senior
who
was
watching
over
his
son
achille
in
a
little
where
the
paralysed
man
now
spent
his
life
in
an
armchair
placed
near
the
window
directly
savin
senior
caught
sight
of
marc
he
raised
a
cry
of
surprise
monsieur
froment
said
he
thought
you
were
angry
with
me
well
it
is
kind
of
you
to
call
he
was
still
as
thin
and
as
puny
as
ever
still
racked
too
by
a
dreadful
cough
yet
he
had
contrived
to
survive
his
fresh
pretty
and
plump
wife
whom
indeed
he
had
killed
by
dint
of
daily
vexations
inspired
by
his
bitter
jealousy
marc
quietly
responded
should
i
be
angry
with
you
monsieur
savin
because
our
ideas
have
never
been
the
same
said
the
son
may
have
married
my
granddaughter
but
that
does
not
suffice
to
reconcile
our
opinions
for
instance
you
and
your
friends
are
now
driving
away
all
the
priests
and
monks
which
i
regard
as
very
unfortunate
for
it
will
only
lead
to
an
increase
of
immorality
heaven
knows
that
i
do
like
those
gentry
for
i
am
an
old
republican
a
socialist
yes
a
socialist
monsieur
froment
but
then
women
and
children
need
the
threats
of
religion
to
check
them
from
evil
courses
as
i
have
never
grown
tired
of
saying
an
involuntary
smile
escaped
marc
as
he
listened
religion
a
police
service
said
he
know
your
theory
but
how
can
religion
exercise
any
power
when
people
no
longer
believe
and
there
is
no
longer
any
reason
to
fear
the
priests
longer
a
reason
to
fear
them
cried
savin
heavens
you
are
much
mistaken
i
myself
have
always
been
one
of
their
victims
if
i
had
sided
with
them
do
you
think
that
i
should
have
vegetated
all
my
life
in
a
little
office
and
now
be
a
charge
on
my
son
jules
after
losing
my
wife
who
was
killed
by
all
sorts
of
privations
and
my
son
achille
whom
you
see
here
so
grievously
afflicted
he
again
is
a
victim
of
the
priests
i
ought
to
have
sent
him
to
a
seminary
and
he
would
now
be
a
prefect
or
a
judge
instead
of
having
contracted
all
sorts
of
aches
and
pains
in
a
horrible
office
which
he
left
unable
to
use
either
his
legs
or
his
arms
so
that
now
he
can
not
even
take
a
basin
of
soup
unassisted
the
priests
are
dirty
scamps
is
it
not
so
achille
but
all
the
same
it
is
better
to
have
them
on
one
side
than
against
one
the
cripple
who
had
greeted
his
old
master
with
a
friendly
nod
now
remarked
slowly
his
speech
being
already
impeded
by
paralysis
priests
long
controlled
the
weather
no
doubt
nevertheless
one
is
beginning
to
do
without
them
very
well
then
with
something
like
a
sneer
he
added
so
it
has
become
easy
enough
to
settle
their
account
and
play
the
judge
as
he
spoke
he
looked
at
adrien
for
whom
that
uncomplimentary
allusion
was
doubtless
intended
achille
unfortunate
position
the
death
of
his
wife
and
a
quarrel
which
had
arisen
between
him
and
his
daughter
léontine
who
was
married
to
a
beaumont
ironmonger
had
embittered
his
nature
and
deeming
his
allusion
insufficient
wishing
to
be
more
precise
he
continued
will
remember
monsieur
froment
that
i
told
you
i
was
still
convinced
of
simon
innocence
at
the
time
when
he
was
recondemned
at
rozan
but
what
could
i
do
could
i
have
made
a
revolution
by
myself
no
of
course
not
so
it
was
best
to
remain
silent
nevertheless
i
now
see
a
number
of
young
gentlemen
calling
us
cowards
and
trying
to
give
us
a
lesson
by
raising
triumphal
arches
to
the
martyr
it
is
brave
work
indeed
on
being
challenged
in
this
fashion
adrien
immediately
understood
that
jules
savin
must
have
spoken
of
the
great
plan
and
instead
of
losing
his
temper
he
strove
to
be
very
amiable
and
conciliatory
everybody
is
brave
on
becoming
just
he
replied
know
very
well
monsieur
that
you
were
always
among
the
reasonable
folk
and
i
confess
that
some
members
of
my
own
family
showed
even
greater
blindness
and
obstinacy
than
others
but
the
general
desire
ought
to
be
to
unite
so
that
all
may
mingle
in
the
same
flame
of
solidarity
and
justice
savin
senior
who
had
been
listening
with
an
air
of
stupefaction
now
suddenly
understood
why
marc
and
adrien
were
there
awaiting
the
return
of
his
son
jules
at
the
outset
he
had
attributed
their
visit
to
politeness
only
of
course
you
have
come
about
that
stupid
scheme
for
offering
reparation
said
he
like
those
relatives
you
speak
of
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
business
no
indeed
my
son
jules
will
act
as
he
pleases
of
course
but
that
will
not
prevent
me
from
keeping
my
own
opinion
the
jews
monsieur
the
jews
always
the
jews
adrien
looked
at
him
in
his
turn
full
of
stupefaction
the
jews
indeed
why
did
he
speak
of
the
jews
was
dead
to
such
a
degree
indeed
that
the
new
generation
failed
to
understand
what
was
meant
when
people
accused
the
jews
of
every
crime
as
adrien
had
said
to
his
grandmother
madame
doloir
there
were
no
jews
left
since
only
citizens
freed
from
the
tyranny
of
dogmas
remained
it
was
essentially
the
roman
church
which
had
exploited
in
the
hope
of
thereby
winning
back
the
incredulous
masses
and
had
disappeared
when
that
church
sank
into
the
darkness
of
expiring
religions
marc
had
followed
the
scene
with
great
interest
comparing
the
past
with
the
present
recalling
the
incidents
and
the
words
of
forty
years
ago
the
better
to
discern
the
moral
of
those
of
however
jules
savin
at
last
came
in
accompanied
by
his
son
robert
a
tall
youth
of
sixteen
whom
he
was
already
initiating
into
the
farmwork
and
directly
he
learnt
the
purpose
of
his
visitors
he
appeared
to
be
much
touched
and
addressing
marc
with
great
deference
exclaimed
froment
you
can
not
doubt
my
desire
to
be
agreeable
to
you
we
all
regard
you
nowadays
as
a
just
and
venerable
master
besides
as
my
friend
adrien
must
have
told
you
i
am
in
no
sense
opposed
to
his
plan
on
the
contrary
i
will
employ
all
the
authority
i
possess
to
second
it
for
i
am
entirely
of
his
opinion
maillebois
will
only
regain
its
honour
when
it
has
offered
reparation
for
its
fault
only
i
repeat
it
there
must
be
absolute
unanimity
in
the
municipal
council
i
am
working
in
that
sense
and
i
beg
you
to
do
the
same
then
as
his
father
began
to
sneer
jules
said
to
him
smiling
do
pretend
to
be
so
you
admitted
simon
innocence
to
me
the
other
day
innocence
oh
i
do
dispute
that
i
also
am
innocent
but
nobody
builds
me
a
house
have
mine
jules
retorted
somewhat
roughly
at
bottom
it
was
precisely
that
circumstance
which
hurt
feelings
the
hospitality
he
received
at
his
son
house
the
fate
that
had
befallen
him
of
ending
his
days
peacefully
in
the
home
of
one
who
had
succeeded
by
dint
of
great
personal
efforts
gave
the
lie
to
his
everlasting
recriminations
the
regret
he
was
always
expressing
at
not
having
sided
with
the
priests
in
spite
of
the
hatred
with
which
he
regarded
them
thus
losing
his
temper
he
cried
if
you
choose
you
can
build
a
cathedral
for
your
simon
it
wo
matter
to
me
for
i
shall
stay
at
home
then
achille
who
tortured
by
the
pains
in
his
legs
had
just
raised
a
pitiful
moan
exclaimed
i
shall
stay
at
home
as
well
but
if
i
were
not
nailed
to
this
armchair
i
would
willingly
go
with
you
my
dear
jules
for
i
belong
to
the
generation
which
did
not
perhaps
do
all
its
duty
but
which
was
not
ignorant
of
it
and
is
ready
to
do
it
now
after
those
words
marc
and
adrien
withdrew
delighted
feeling
certain
of
success
and
when
marc
found
himself
alone
again
returning
to
his
daughter
louise
by
way
of
the
broad
thoroughfares
of
the
new
district
he
summed
up
all
he
had
just
seen
and
heard
the
memories
which
at
the
same
time
returned
to
him
enabling
him
to
gauge
the
distance
which
had
been
travelled
during
the
last
forty
years
the
whole
story
of
his
life
his
efforts
and
his
triumph
was
spread
out
and
he
felt
that
he
had
been
right
in
former
days
when
he
had
said
that
if
france
did
not
protest
and
rise
to
do
justice
in
the
simon
case
it
was
because
she
was
steeped
in
too
much
ignorance
because
she
was
debased
and
poisoned
by
religious
imbecility
and
malice
because
she
was
kept
in
childish
superstitions
and
notions
by
a
press
given
over
to
lucre
scandal
and
blackmailing
and
in
the
same
way
a
clear
intuition
had
come
to
him
of
the
only
possible
remedy
instruction
education
which
would
liberate
one
and
all
endow
them
with
solidarity
and
the
intelligent
bravery
of
life
by
killing
falsehood
destroying
error
sweeping
away
the
senseless
dogmas
of
the
church
with
its
hell
its
heaven
and
its
doctrines
of
social
death
that
was
what
marc
had
desired
and
that
indeed
was
the
work
which
was
being
accomplished
the
liberation
of
the
people
by
the
primary
schools
the
rescue
of
all
citizens
from
the
state
of
iniquity
in
which
they
had
been
plunged
in
order
that
they
might
at
last
become
capable
of
truth
and
justice
but
it
was
particularly
a
feeling
of
appeasement
which
now
came
over
marc
only
forgiveness
tolerance
and
kindliness
surged
from
his
heart
in
former
times
he
had
greatly
suffered
and
he
had
often
felt
passionately
angry
with
men
on
seeing
with
what
stupid
cruelty
they
behaved
and
how
obstinately
they
persisted
in
evil
at
present
however
he
could
not
forget
the
words
spoken
by
fernand
bongard
and
achille
savin
they
had
tolerated
injustice
no
doubt
but
as
they
now
said
this
was
because
they
had
not
known
and
because
they
had
not
felt
strong
enough
to
contend
with
that
injustice
the
slumber
of
their
intelligence
could
not
be
imputed
to
the
disinherited
scions
of
ignorance
as
a
crime
and
marc
willingly
forgave
one
and
all
he
no
longer
harboured
any
rancour
even
against
the
obstinate
ones
who
refused
to
open
their
minds
to
facts
he
would
simply
have
liked
the
festival
planned
for
simon
return
to
become
a
festival
of
general
reconciliation
one
in
which
the
whole
of
maillebois
would
embrace
and
mingle
in
brotherly
concord
resolving
to
work
henceforth
for
the
happiness
of
all
on
reaching
louise
quarters
at
the
school
where
geneviève
had
awaited
him
and
where
they
were
to
dine
in
company
with
clément
charlotte
and
lucienne
marc
was
pleased
to
find
that
sébastien
and
sarah
were
also
there
having
just
arrived
from
beaumont
to
share
the
meal
indeed
it
was
a
general
family
gathering
and
several
leaves
had
to
be
added
to
the
table
there
were
marc
and
geneviève
then
clément
and
charlotte
with
their
daughter
lucienne
who
was
already
seven
years
old
then
joseph
simon
and
louise
then
sébastien
milhomme
and
sarah
then
françois
simon
joseph
son
and
thérèse
milhomme
daughter
two
cousins
who
had
married
and
who
were
already
the
parents
of
a
little
named
rose
altogether
they
made
a
dozen
full
of
health
and
appetite
acclamations
arose
when
marc
recounted
his
afternoon
describing
adrien
plan
and
expressing
his
belief
in
its
success
joseph
alone
felt
doubtful
for
he
was
not
convinced
he
said
of
the
favourable
disposition
but
charlotte
immediately
intervened
are
mistaken
she
exclaimed
uncle
jules
is
altogether
on
our
side
we
can
rely
on
him
he
is
the
only
one
of
the
family
who
ever
showed
me
any
kindness
charlotte
it
should
be
said
had
become
dependent
on
her
grandfather
savin
senior
at
the
time
when
her
mother
had
eloped
for
it
had
become
necessary
to
place
her
father
in
an
asylum
on
account
of
the
alcoholism
to
which
he
had
given
way
the
girl
had
then
experienced
much
suffering
being
often
cuffed
and
sparsely
fed
savin
who
seemed
oblivious
of
the
deplorable
result
of
the
pious
hypocrisy
in
which
his
daughter
hortense
had
been
reared
by
mademoiselle
rouzaire
accused
his
grandchild
of
being
an
atheist
a
rebel
full
of
deplorable
ways
which
were
due
to
the
teaching
of
mademoiselle
mazeline
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
charlotte
was
delightful
free
from
all
false
prudery
and
gifted
with
healthy
uprightness
sense
and
tenderness
and
clément
having
married
her
in
spite
of
all
obstacles
they
had
since
lived
together
in
the
happiest
and
the
closest
of
unions
is
right
said
marc
who
also
desired
to
defend
jules
savin
mayor
is
on
our
side
but
the
best
of
all
is
that
among
the
contractors
for
the
house
which
it
is
proposed
to
present
to
simon
there
will
be
the
two
doloirs
auguste
the
mason
and
charles
the
locksmith
besides
which
by
their
ties
of
relationship
even
fernand
bongard
and
achille
savin
will
be
indirectly
concerned
in
it
ah
sébastien
my
friend
who
would
have
thought
that
would
come
to
pass
in
the
days
when
you
and
those
fine
fellows
attended
my
school
at
this
sally
sébastien
milhomme
began
to
laugh
though
his
mood
was
scarcely
a
cheerful
one
for
a
recent
family
loss
a
very
tragical
affair
had
affected
him
painfully
during
the
previous
spring
his
aunt
madame
edouard
had
died
leaving
the
stationery
business
to
her
madame
alexandre
her
son
victor
having
disappeared
she
had
of
recent
years
seemed
to
waste
away
no
longer
attending
to
the
business
in
which
she
had
once
taken
such
a
passionate
interest
and
feeling
indeed
quite
at
sea
amidst
those
new
times
which
she
altogether
failed
to
understand
madame
alexandre
on
remaining
alone
had
continued
carrying
on
the
business
for
she
did
not
wish
to
inconvenience
her
son
sébastien
though
the
latter
position
was
becoming
extremely
good
one
evening
however
victor
suddenly
reappeared
emerging
hungry
and
sordid
from
the
depths
in
which
he
had
been
leading
a
crapulous
life
he
had
heard
of
his
mother
death
and
he
instantly
demanded
that
the
business
should
be
put
up
for
sale
and
the
old
partnership
liquidated
in
order
that
he
might
carry
off
his
share
of
the
proceeds
such
then
was
the
end
of
the
little
shop
in
the
rue
courte
where
many
generations
of
schoolboys
had
purchased
their
copybooks
and
their
pens
for
a
short
time
victor
showed
himself
here
and
there
in
maillebois
leading
a
merry
life
almost
invariably
in
the
company
of
his
old
chum
polydor
souquet
who
had
fallen
to
the
gutter
one
evening
marc
having
to
cross
a
street
of
caught
sight
of
them
with
another
man
whose
black
figure
strikingly
resembled
that
of
brother
gorgias
and
finally
barely
a
week
before
the
family
dinner
given
by
louise
the
police
had
found
a
man
lying
dead
with
his
skull
split
outside
a
haunt
of
debauchery
the
dead
man
was
victor
there
had
evidently
been
some
dim
ignoble
tragedy
which
the
interested
parties
endeavoured
to
hush
up
yes
said
sébastien
in
reply
to
marc
remember
my
schoolfellows
with
a
few
unfortunate
exceptions
they
have
not
turned
out
so
badly
but
in
life
one
is
at
times
exposed
to
certain
poisons
which
prove
pitiless
the
others
did
not
insist
they
preferred
to
inquire
after
his
mother
whom
he
had
now
taken
to
live
with
him
at
the
beaumont
training
college
and
who
still
enjoyed
good
health
in
spite
of
her
great
age
sébastien
new
position
gave
him
a
great
deal
of
occupation
particularly
as
he
desired
to
perfect
the
work
of
his
venerated
master
salvan
he
exclaimed
public
reparation
offered
to
simon
that
glorification
of
a
schoolmaster
will
be
a
great
joy
for
all
of
us
i
want
my
pupils
to
participate
in
it
and
for
that
purpose
i
shall
endeavour
to
obtain
a
day
holiday
for
them
marc
who
had
rejoiced
at
sébastien
appointment
as
if
it
were
a
personal
triumph
at
once
signified
his
approval
so
said
he
we
will
bring
the
old
ones
as
well
salvan
mademoiselle
mazeline
and
mignot
besides
speaking
of
there
is
already
a
fine
battalion
here
present
the
others
began
to
laugh
with
the
exception
of
the
two
children
they
were
indeed
all
teachers
clément
and
charlotte
still
carried
on
the
jonville
schools
joseph
and
louise
had
decided
that
they
would
never
quit
maillebois
sébastien
and
sarah
relied
on
remaining
at
the
beaumont
training
college
until
the
former
reached
the
age
limit
while
as
for
the
younger
couple
françois
and
thérèse
they
had
not
long
been
appointed
to
the
dherbecourt
schools
where
their
parents
had
previously
made
their
françois
in
whom
one
traced
a
likeness
to
his
parents
joseph
and
louise
also
resembled
his
grandfather
marc
for
he
had
much
the
same
lofty
brow
and
bright
eyes
though
the
latter
in
his
case
glowed
with
what
seemed
to
be
a
flame
of
insatiable
desire
in
thérèse
on
the
other
hand
one
found
the
great
beauty
of
her
mother
sarah
softened
quieted
as
it
were
by
the
intellectual
refinement
which
she
had
inherited
from
her
father
sébastien
and
rose
the
young
couple
little
girl
the
last
born
of
the
family
and
as
such
worshipped
by
one
and
all
seemed
to
personify
the
budding
future
the
dinner
proved
delightfully
gay
how
joyful
for
joseph
and
sarah
the
children
of
the
innocent
martyr
tortured
for
so
many
years
was
the
thought
of
the
festival
of
reparation
which
was
now
being
planned
their
own
children
and
their
grandchild
all
that
had
come
from
their
blood
mingled
with
that
of
marc
the
martyr
most
heroic
defender
would
participate
in
that
glorification
four
generations
indeed
would
be
present
to
celebrate
the
truth
and
the
would
be
formed
of
all
the
good
workers
who
having
suffered
for
its
sake
were
entitled
to
share
its
triumph
laughter
and
again
laughter
arose
they
all
drank
to
the
return
of
simon
and
even
when
ten
struck
the
happy
family
continued
to
give
expression
to
its
delight
quite
forgetful
of
the
trains
by
which
some
of
its
members
were
to
return
to
beaumont
and
others
to
jonville
from
that
day
forward
things
moved
with
unexpected
rapidity
adrien
scheme
on
being
laid
before
the
municipal
council
was
voted
unanimously
as
jules
savin
the
mayor
had
desired
nobody
even
thought
of
opposing
the
suggested
inscription
none
of
the
applications
and
pleadings
which
the
promoters
of
the
scheme
had
imagined
necessary
were
required
for
the
idea
to
which
they
gave
expression
already
existed
in
embryo
in
the
minds
of
all
there
was
remorse
for
the
past
uneasiness
at
the
thought
of
the
unhealed
iniquity
and
a
craving
to
repair
it
for
the
sake
of
the
town
honour
everybody
now
felt
that
it
was
impossible
to
be
happy
outside
the
pale
of
civic
solidarity
for
durable
happiness
can
only
come
to
a
people
when
it
is
just
and
so
in
a
few
weeks
time
the
subscription
lists
were
filled
as
the
amount
required
was
a
comparatively
small
one
being
no
more
than
thirty
thousand
francs
for
the
site
of
the
house
was
given
by
the
municipality
people
contented
themselves
with
subscribing
two
three
or
at
the
utmost
five
francs
in
order
that
a
larger
number
of
subscribers
might
participate
the
workmen
of
the
and
the
peasants
of
the
environs
contributed
their
and
their
francs
and
at
the
end
of
march
the
building
was
put
in
hand
for
it
was
desired
that
everything
should
be
in
readiness
the
last
woodwork
in
position
and
the
last
paint
dry
by
the
date
which
simon
had
ended
by
fixing
for
his
return
footnote
in
september
then
the
simple
but
cheerful
house
stood
completed
in
its
pleasant
garden
which
was
faced
by
a
railing
on
the
side
of
the
square
its
owner
might
come
to
take
possession
of
it
when
he
pleased
for
nothing
was
lacking
true
a
drapery
hung
before
the
marble
slab
bearing
an
inscription
over
the
doorway
but
this
inscription
so
far
as
simon
was
concerned
was
to
be
the
great
surprise
and
would
only
be
uncovered
at
the
last
moment
adrien
repaired
to
the
pyrenees
to
plan
the
final
arrangements
with
simon
and
david
and
it
was
then
decided
that
the
former
wife
who
was
in
a
very
weak
state
of
health
should
in
the
first
instance
install
herself
in
the
house
with
the
help
of
her
children
joseph
and
sarah
then
on
the
appointed
day
simon
would
arrive
with
his
brother
david
there
would
be
an
official
reception
at
the
railway
station
and
afterwards
he
would
be
conducted
in
triumph
to
his
new
home
the
gift
of
his
where
his
wife
and
children
would
await
him
at
last
on
the
twentieth
of
september
a
sunday
the
solemnity
was
enacted
amid
radiant
sunshine
and
a
warm
and
pure
atmosphere
the
streets
of
maillebois
were
decorated
with
flags
the
last
flowers
of
the
season
were
scattered
along
the
procession
line
of
route
and
early
in
the
morning
although
the
train
would
only
arrive
at
three
in
the
afternoon
the
population
assembled
out
of
doors
gathering
together
in
a
happy
singing
laughing
multitude
whose
numbers
were
swollen
by
all
the
visitors
who
flocked
in
from
neighbouring
parishes
at
noon
one
could
no
longer
circulate
outside
the
house
on
the
large
new
square
whose
was
invaded
by
the
families
of
the
neighbourhood
there
were
people
too
at
all
the
windows
and
the
very
roadways
were
blocked
by
waves
of
spectators
eager
to
see
and
to
cry
their
passion
for
justice
nothing
could
have
been
grander
or
more
inspiring
marc
and
geneviève
had
arrived
from
jonville
with
clément
charlotte
and
little
lucienne
early
in
the
day
it
was
arranged
that
they
should
await
simon
in
the
garden
of
the
house
grouped
around
madame
simon
her
children
joseph
and
sarah
her
grandchildren
françois
and
thérèse
and
her
little
rose
louise
of
course
was
there
beside
her
husband
joseph
and
sébastien
beside
his
wife
sarah
these
constituted
the
three
generations
which
had
sprung
from
the
blood
of
the
innocent
man
mingled
with
that
of
his
champions
then
also
places
had
been
reserved
for
the
first
defenders
the
survivors
of
the
heroic
days
salvan
mademoiselle
mazeline
and
mignot
as
well
as
for
the
fervent
artisans
of
the
work
of
reparation
the
now
conquered
and
enthusiastic
members
of
the
bongard
doloir
and
savin
families
it
was
rumoured
that
delbos
the
the
hero
of
the
two
trials
who
for
four
years
recently
had
held
the
office
of
minister
of
the
interior
had
gone
to
join
simon
and
david
in
order
to
reach
the
town
in
their
company
only
the
mayor
and
a
deputation
of
the
municipal
council
were
to
meet
the
brothers
at
the
railway
station
and
conduct
them
to
the
house
decked
with
banners
and
garlands
where
the
ceremony
of
presentation
would
take
place
and
there
in
accordance
with
this
programme
marc
remained
waiting
with
the
rest
of
the
family
in
spite
of
all
his
joyous
eagerness
to
embrace
the
triumpher
two
struck
there
was
still
an
hour
to
be
spent
patiently
meanwhile
the
crowd
steadily
increased
marc
having
left
the
garden
to
mingle
with
the
groups
and
hear
what
was
being
said
found
that
the
one
subject
of
conversation
was
that
extraordinary
story
emerging
from
the
past
that
condemnation
of
an
innocent
man
which
had
become
both
abominable
and
inexplicable
in
the
eyes
of
the
new
generations
from
the
younger
folk
a
long
cry
of
indignant
amazement
arose
while
the
old
people
those
who
had
witnessed
the
iniquity
tried
to
defend
themselves
with
vague
gestures
and
shamefaced
explanations
now
that
the
truth
had
become
manifest
in
the
full
sunlight
endowed
with
all
the
force
of
invincible
certainty
the
children
and
the
grandchildren
could
not
understand
how
their
parents
and
grandparents
had
carried
blindness
and
egotism
so
far
as
to
fail
to
fathom
so
simple
an
affair
and
doubtless
many
of
the
older
folk
shared
the
astonishment
of
the
younger
ones
and
were
at
a
loss
to
account
for
the
credulity
into
which
they
had
fallen
that
indeed
was
their
best
answer
to
the
reproaches
they
heard
it
was
necessary
to
have
lived
in
those
times
to
understand
the
power
of
falsehood
over
ignorance
one
old
man
penitently
confessed
his
error
another
related
how
he
had
hissed
simon
on
the
day
of
his
arrest
and
how
he
had
now
been
waiting
two
hours
in
order
to
acclaim
him
anxious
as
he
was
not
to
die
with
his
bad
action
upon
his
conscience
and
a
youth
his
grandson
thereupon
threw
himself
on
the
old
man
neck
and
kissed
him
laughing
with
tears
in
his
eyes
marc
was
delightfully
touched
by
the
scene
and
continued
to
walk
about
looking
and
listening
but
all
at
once
he
stopped
short
he
had
just
recognised
polydor
souquet
clad
in
rags
with
a
ravaged
countenance
as
if
still
under
the
effects
of
a
night
of
intoxication
and
marc
was
thunderstruck
when
by
the
side
of
polydor
he
perceived
brother
gorgias
clad
as
usual
in
black
without
a
sign
of
linen
his
greasy
old
clinging
fast
to
his
dark
hide
he
gorgias
was
not
drunk
silent
and
fierce
of
aspect
erect
in
all
his
tragic
leanness
he
darted
fiery
glances
at
the
crowd
and
marc
could
hear
that
polydor
with
a
drunkard
stupid
obstinacy
was
deriding
him
respecting
the
affair
of
which
everybody
was
talking
around
them
slabbering
and
stammering
the
scamp
went
on
say
old
man
the
you
remember
eh
the
it
was
i
who
sneaked
it
i
had
it
in
my
pocket
and
i
was
stupid
enough
to
give
it
you
back
while
you
were
seeing
me
home
ah
yes
that
wretched
a
sudden
flash
of
light
illumined
marc
mind
he
now
knew
the
whole
truth
the
one
gap
in
the
affair
which
had
still
worried
him
occasionally
was
now
filled
polydor
had
given
the
slip
to
gorgias
and
that
explained
how
it
had
chanced
to
be
in
his
pocket
and
how
it
had
become
mingled
with
a
copy
of
petit
when
terrified
by
his
victim
cries
he
had
hastily
sought
a
handkerchief
a
stopper
of
any
kind
to
use
as
a
gag
you
know
old
man
stammered
polydor
liked
each
other
very
much
and
we
did
tell
our
business
to
other
folk
and
yet
if
i
chattered
what
a
rumpus
there
would
have
been
ah
what
a
face
my
aunt
pélagie
would
have
pulled
in
an
ignoble
state
the
rascal
went
on
jeering
unconscious
it
seemed
of
the
presence
of
the
people
around
him
and
gorgias
who
from
time
to
time
gave
him
a
contemptuous
glance
must
suddenly
have
understood
that
marc
had
heard
the
drunkard
involuntary
confession
for
in
a
low
voice
he
growled
quiet
you
be
quiet
you
rotten
cur
you
stink
of
your
sin
and
mine
you
have
damned
me
again
by
your
ignominy
be
quiet
you
filthy
thing
it
is
i
who
will
speak
yes
i
will
confess
my
fault
in
order
that
god
may
pardon
me
then
addressing
himself
to
marc
who
was
still
lost
in
silent
amazement
he
went
on
heard
him
monsieur
froment
did
you
well
it
necessary
that
all
should
hear
i
have
been
consumed
long
enough
by
a
desire
to
confess
myself
to
men
even
as
i
have
confessed
to
god
in
order
that
my
salvation
may
be
the
more
glorious
and
besides
all
these
people
exasperate
me
they
know
absolutely
nothing
they
keep
on
repeating
my
name
with
execration
as
if
i
were
the
only
culprit
but
wait
a
moment
they
will
see
it
is
not
so
for
i
will
tell
them
everything
then
though
he
was
over
seventy
years
old
he
contrived
to
spring
upon
the
low
wall
supporting
the
garden
railing
of
the
house
where
simon
the
innocent
man
was
soon
to
be
received
in
triumph
and
clinging
with
one
hand
to
that
railing
he
turned
and
faced
his
mighty
audience
during
the
hour
he
had
spent
roaming
through
the
groups
he
had
heard
his
name
fall
from
every
tongue
as
a
name
of
infamy
and
he
had
gradually
been
fired
by
a
sombre
fever
the
bravery
of
a
fine
bandit
who
denies
none
of
his
actions
but
is
ready
to
cast
them
in
the
teeth
of
men
full
of
a
mad
pride
that
he
should
have
dared
to
commit
them
what
caused
him
most
suffering
however
was
that
he
alone
should
be
named
that
all
the
weight
of
the
general
execration
should
be
cast
upon
his
shoulders
for
the
others
his
accomplices
seemed
to
be
quite
forgotten
only
the
previous
day
his
resources
again
being
exhausted
he
had
attempted
to
force
himself
upon
father
crabot
who
was
shut
up
at
the
estate
of
la
désirade
and
he
had
been
flung
out
with
the
alms
of
a
piece
the
very
last
that
would
be
given
him
so
he
had
been
told
and
now
amid
all
the
insulting
words
that
were
levelled
at
him
nobody
shouted
the
name
of
father
crabot
why
as
he
was
ready
to
expiate
his
transgression
why
should
not
father
crabot
expiate
his
also
no
doubt
he
gorgias
would
extract
no
more
pieces
from
that
coward
if
he
were
to
reveal
everything
but
his
hatred
was
now
dearer
to
him
than
money
and
it
would
be
blissful
to
cast
his
enemy
into
the
flames
of
hell
while
he
himself
ascended
to
the
delights
of
paradise
by
virtue
of
the
penance
of
a
public
confession
the
idea
of
which
had
long
haunted
him
thus
an
unexpected
an
extraordinary
scene
began
with
a
violent
sweeping
gesture
gorgias
sought
to
gather
the
crowd
together
and
attract
its
attention
and
in
a
shrill
but
still
powerful
voice
he
called
to
me
listen
to
me
i
will
tell
you
everything
but
at
first
he
was
not
heard
and
he
had
to
raise
the
same
cry
twice
thrice
a
dozen
times
with
increasing
unwearying
energy
by
degrees
he
was
noticed
and
people
became
attentive
and
when
some
of
the
old
folk
had
recognised
him
when
his
name
had
flown
from
mouth
to
mouth
amid
a
quiver
of
horror
a
silence
at
last
fell
from
one
to
the
other
end
of
the
great
square
to
me
listen
to
me
i
will
tell
you
everything
raised
above
the
heads
of
all
the
others
with
the
broad
sunlight
streaming
on
him
he
clung
with
one
hand
to
the
iron
railing
while
with
the
other
he
went
on
making
vehement
gesticulations
as
if
he
were
sabring
the
air
his
threadbare
hung
closely
to
his
withered
knotty
frame
and
with
his
dusky
face
from
which
jutted
the
big
beak
of
a
bird
of
prey
he
looked
quite
terrible
like
some
phantom
of
the
past
whose
eyes
glowed
with
the
flames
of
all
the
abominable
passions
of
long
ago
speak
of
truth
and
justice
he
cried
you
know
nothing
and
you
are
not
just
you
all
fall
upon
me
you
treat
me
as
if
i
were
the
only
culprit
whereas
others
sinned
more
even
than
i
did
i
may
have
been
a
criminal
but
others
accepted
my
crime
hid
it
and
continued
it
wait
a
little
while
you
will
see
that
i
do
lack
the
courage
to
confess
my
sin
but
why
am
i
the
only
one
ready
to
confess
why
is
my
master
my
chief
the
father
crabot
here
also
ready
to
humiliate
himself
and
tell
everything
let
him
come
go
and
fetch
him
from
his
and
let
him
confess
his
sins
before
you
and
do
penitence
beside
me
otherwise
i
shall
speak
out
i
shall
proclaim
his
crime
with
mine
for
though
i
be
the
most
humble
the
most
miserable
of
sinners
god
is
in
me
and
it
is
god
who
demands
expiation
of
him
as
of
me
then
in
the
bitterest
language
he
declared
that
all
his
superiors
father
crabot
at
the
head
of
them
were
but
degenerate
catholics
poltroons
and
enjoyers
of
life
the
church
was
dying
by
reason
of
their
cowardice
their
compromises
with
the
weaknesses
and
the
vanities
of
the
world
it
was
indeed
his
favourite
theory
that
all
true
religious
spirit
had
departed
from
those
monks
those
priests
and
those
bishops
who
ought
to
have
ensured
the
reign
of
jesus
by
fire
and
sword
earth
and
mankind
belonged
to
god
alone
and
god
had
given
them
to
his
church
the
sovereign
delegate
of
his
power
the
church
therefore
possessed
everything
and
held
absolute
dominion
over
everybody
and
everything
to
her
belonged
the
disposal
of
wealth
none
could
be
wealthy
save
by
her
permission
to
her
belonged
even
the
disposal
of
life
for
every
living
man
was
her
subject
whom
she
allowed
to
live
or
suppressed
according
to
the
interests
of
heaven
such
was
the
doctrine
from
which
the
true
saints
had
never
departed
he
a
mere
humble
ignorantine
had
always
practised
and
exalted
that
doctrine
and
his
superiors
though
they
had
wronged
him
in
other
respects
had
always
recognised
in
him
the
rare
merit
of
possessing
the
true
absolute
religious
spirit
whereas
they
themselves
the
crabots
the
philibins
and
the
fulgences
had
ruined
religion
by
their
compromises
their
trickery
with
the
freethinkers
the
jews
the
protestants
and
the
freemasons
like
opportunists
anxious
to
please
they
had
gradually
abandoned
dogmas
and
concealed
the
asperity
of
doctrines
whereas
they
ought
to
have
fought
openly
against
impiety
and
have
slaughtered
and
burnt
all
heretics
he
himself
dreamt
of
seeing
a
huge
sacrificial
pyre
set
up
in
the
midst
of
paris
on
which
he
would
have
cast
the
whole
guilty
nation
in
order
that
the
flames
and
the
stench
from
all
those
millions
of
bodies
might
have
ascended
to
the
glowing
skies
to
rejoice
and
appease
the
deity
and
he
next
exclaimed
soon
as
a
sinner
confesses
and
does
penance
he
is
no
longer
guilty
he
again
recovers
the
grace
of
his
sovereign
master
what
man
is
there
who
never
sins
all
who
are
made
of
flesh
are
liable
to
err
even
like
the
layman
he
who
is
in
holy
orders
and
whom
the
beast
which
is
in
all
men
precipitates
into
crime
has
but
one
obligation
cast
upon
him
that
of
confession
and
if
he
receives
absolution
if
he
expiates
his
sin
with
firm
repentance
he
redeems
himself
he
becomes
again
as
white
as
snow
worthy
to
enter
into
heaven
among
the
roses
and
lilies
of
mary
i
confessed
my
sin
to
father
théodose
who
absolved
me
and
i
owed
nothing
more
to
anybody
since
god
who
ordains
and
knows
all
things
had
pardoned
me
by
the
sacrament
of
one
of
his
ministers
and
in
the
same
way
from
that
day
forward
each
time
that
i
lied
each
time
that
my
superiors
compelled
me
to
lie
i
went
back
to
the
confessional
and
i
washed
my
soul
clean
of
all
the
impurities
with
which
human
fragility
had
soiled
it
alas
i
have
often
and
i
have
greatly
sinned
for
god
in
order
no
doubt
to
try
me
has
allowed
the
devil
to
assail
me
with
all
the
fires
of
hell
but
i
have
battered
my
chest
with
my
fists
i
have
made
my
knees
bleed
by
dragging
them
over
the
flagstones
of
chapels
i
have
paid
and
i
repeat
that
i
owe
nothing
whatever
a
flight
of
archangels
would
bear
me
straight
to
paradise
if
i
should
die
ere
lapsing
again
into
the
original
mire
whence
in
common
with
all
men
i
have
sprung
and
in
particular
i
owe
nothing
to
men
i
have
never
owed
them
anything
my
crime
lies
between
god
and
me
his
servant
but
he
has
forgiven
me
and
so
if
i
speak
here
it
is
because
i
choose
to
do
so
because
i
desire
to
couple
with
the
divine
mercy
the
martyrdom
of
a
last
humiliation
in
order
that
i
may
enter
paradise
in
triumph
a
celestial
joy
which
whatever
my
abjection
i
shall
assuredly
taste
thanks
to
my
penitence
whereas
you
will
never
taste
it
race
of
unbelievers
and
blasphemers
that
you
are
destined
one
and
all
to
the
flames
of
hell
amid
his
sombre
fury
that
transport
of
savage
faith
which
had
raised
him
there
alone
and
impudent
face
to
face
with
the
multitude
gorgias
again
began
to
jeer
and
there
came
to
him
that
habitual
twitching
of
the
lips
which
disclosed
some
of
his
teeth
in
a
grimace
suggestive
of
both
scorn
and
cruelty
polydor
who
for
a
moment
had
seemed
quite
scared
and
had
gazed
at
him
with
dilated
eyes
blurred
by
his
drunkenness
had
now
fallen
beside
the
railing
overcome
by
sleepiness
and
already
snoring
the
crowd
in
horrified
expectancy
of
the
promised
confession
had
hitherto
preserved
silence
but
it
was
now
growing
weary
of
that
long
oration
in
which
it
found
all
the
unconquerable
pride
and
insolence
of
the
churchman
who
deems
himself
and
inviolate
what
did
the
scamp
mean
by
that
speech
why
did
he
not
content
himself
with
stating
the
facts
what
was
the
use
of
such
a
long
preamble
when
a
dozen
words
would
have
sufficed
thus
a
growl
arose
and
a
rush
would
have
swept
gorgias
away
if
marc
now
very
attentive
and
fully
master
of
himself
had
not
stepped
forward
and
with
a
gesture
calmed
the
growing
impatience
and
anger
moreover
gorgias
remained
imperturbable
despite
all
interruptions
he
went
on
repeating
in
the
same
shrill
voice
that
he
alone
was
brave
that
he
alone
was
really
upon
god
side
and
that
the
other
sinners
the
cowards
would
after
all
have
to
pay
for
their
transgressions
since
god
had
set
him
there
to
make
public
confession
on
their
behalf
as
well
as
his
own
this
being
a
supreme
expiation
whence
the
church
compromised
by
her
unworthy
leaders
would
emerge
rejuvenated
and
for
ever
victorious
then
all
at
once
as
if
he
were
a
prey
to
the
wildest
remorse
he
beat
his
chest
violently
with
both
fists
and
cried
in
distressful
tearful
accents
have
sinned
o
god
o
god
do
thou
forgive
me
release
me
from
the
claws
of
the
devil
o
god
that
i
may
yet
bless
thy
holy
name
yes
god
wills
it
listen
to
me
listen
to
me
i
will
tell
you
everything
then
he
laid
himself
bare
as
it
were
before
the
assembled
throng
he
spoke
plainly
of
his
gross
appetites
he
set
forth
that
he
had
been
a
big
eater
a
deep
drinker
and
that
vice
had
dogged
him
from
his
childhood
in
spite
of
all
his
intelligence
he
had
then
refused
to
study
he
had
preferred
to
play
the
truant
to
roam
the
fields
and
hide
in
the
woods
with
little
hussies
his
father
jean
plumet
after
being
a
poacher
had
been
turned
into
a
gamekeeper
by
the
countess
de
quédeville
his
mother
a
hussy
had
disappeared
after
giving
him
birth
he
could
still
picture
his
father
as
he
had
appeared
to
him
lying
on
a
stretcher
in
the
courtyard
at
valmarie
whither
he
had
been
brought
dead
after
two
bullets
had
been
lodged
in
his
chest
by
one
of
his
former
companions
a
poacher
and
subsequently
he
gorgias
had
been
brought
up
with
the
countess
grandson
gaston
an
unmanageable
lad
who
also
refused
to
study
preferring
to
hide
himself
away
with
little
hussies
climb
poplar
trees
for
magpies
nests
and
wade
the
rivers
in
search
of
crawfish
at
that
time
he
gorgias
had
become
acquainted
with
father
philibin
gaston
tutor
and
father
crabot
who
was
then
in
all
his
manly
prime
adored
by
the
old
countess
and
already
the
real
master
of
valmarie
then
with
sudden
abruptness
plainly
and
brutally
gorgias
related
how
gaston
the
grandson
and
heir
had
come
by
his
death
a
death
which
he
had
witnessed
from
a
distance
and
of
which
he
had
kept
the
terrible
secret
for
so
many
years
the
boy
had
been
deliberately
pushed
into
the
river
and
drowned
there
the
misfortune
being
attributed
to
an
accident
in
such
wise
that
a
few
months
later
the
old
countess
finally
bestowed
her
property
upon
father
crabot
striking
his
breast
with
increasing
fury
beside
himself
with
contrition
gorgias
continued
amid
his
sobs
have
sinned
i
have
sinned
o
god
and
my
superiors
have
sinned
still
more
frightfully
than
i
for
it
was
they
o
god
who
ever
set
me
an
evil
example
but
since
i
am
here
to
expiate
their
sins
as
well
as
mine
by
confessing
everything
o
god
perchance
thou
wilt
pardon
them
in
thine
infinite
mercy
even
as
thou
wilt
assuredly
pardon
me
also
but
a
quiver
of
indignant
revolt
now
sped
through
the
crowd
fists
were
raised
and
voices
demanded
vengeance
while
gorgias
resuming
his
narrative
related
that
from
that
time
forward
fathers
crabot
and
philibin
had
never
abandoned
him
linked
to
him
as
they
were
by
a
bond
of
blood
relying
on
him
as
he
relied
on
them
this
was
the
old
pact
which
marc
had
long
suspected
gorgias
being
admitted
to
the
church
and
becoming
an
ignorantine
an
of
the
deity
one
who
both
alarmed
and
enraptured
his
superiors
by
the
wonderful
religious
spirit
which
glowed
in
his
guilty
flesh
again
the
wretched
man
sobbed
aloud
and
all
at
once
he
passed
to
the
horrid
crime
of
which
simon
had
been
accused
little
angel
was
there
o
god
it
is
the
truth
i
had
just
taken
the
other
boy
home
and
i
was
passing
across
the
dark
square
when
i
saw
the
little
angel
in
his
room
which
was
lighted
up
thou
god
knowest
that
i
approached
him
without
evil
intention
simply
out
of
curiosity
and
in
a
fatherly
spirit
in
order
to
scold
him
for
leaving
his
window
open
and
thou
knowest
also
that
for
a
while
i
talked
to
him
as
a
friend
asking
him
to
show
me
the
pictures
on
his
table
sweet
and
pious
pictures
which
were
still
perfumed
by
the
incense
of
the
first
communion
but
why
o
god
why
didst
thou
then
allow
the
devil
to
tempt
me
why
didst
thou
abandon
me
to
the
tempter
who
impelled
me
to
spring
over
the
under
the
pretence
of
taking
a
closer
look
at
the
pictures
though
alas
the
flames
of
hell
were
already
burning
within
me
ah
why
didst
thou
suffer
it
o
god
ah
verily
my
god
thy
ways
are
mysterious
and
terrible
the
throng
had
now
again
relapsed
into
deathly
silence
amid
the
frightful
anguish
which
wrung
every
breast
as
the
ignoble
confession
at
last
took
its
course
not
a
breath
was
heard
horror
spread
over
all
those
motionless
folk
terrified
by
the
thought
of
what
was
coming
and
marc
who
was
very
white
quite
scared
at
seeing
the
truth
rise
before
him
at
last
after
so
many
lies
gazed
fixedly
at
the
wretched
culprit
who
was
gesticulating
frantically
amid
the
sobs
which
choked
him
little
child
he
was
so
pretty
thou
hadst
given
him
o
god
the
fair
and
curly
head
of
a
little
angel
like
the
cherubs
of
pious
paintings
he
seemed
indeed
to
have
but
that
angelic
head
with
two
wings
kill
him
o
god
did
i
have
any
such
horrible
thought
speak
thou
canst
read
my
heart
i
was
so
fond
of
him
i
would
not
have
plucked
a
hair
from
his
head
but
it
is
true
the
fire
of
hell
had
come
upon
me
satan
transported
me
blinded
me
and
the
boy
became
alarmed
he
began
to
call
out
to
call
out
to
call
out
o
god
those
calls
those
calls
i
hear
them
always
always
and
they
madden
me
it
seemed
indeed
as
if
gorgias
were
now
a
prey
to
some
supreme
paroxysm
his
eyes
glowed
like
coals
of
fire
in
his
convulsed
countenance
a
little
foam
appeared
upon
his
twisted
lips
while
his
lean
bent
frame
quivered
from
head
to
foot
with
spasmodic
shocks
and
at
last
a
great
access
of
rage
transported
him
like
one
of
the
damned
whom
the
devil
turns
with
his
fork
over
the
infernal
brazier
he
howled
no
that
not
the
plain
truth
that
again
is
arranged
and
embellished
i
must
tell
all
i
will
tell
all
it
is
at
that
price
only
that
i
shall
taste
the
eternal
delights
of
paradise
what
followed
was
full
of
horror
he
related
everything
in
plain
crude
abominable
language
and
when
he
again
came
to
his
cries
he
recounted
his
cowardly
terror
his
eager
desire
to
conceal
his
crime
for
his
buzzing
ears
already
seemed
to
the
gallop
of
the
gendarmes
pursuing
him
in
wild
despair
he
had
sought
for
something
he
had
searched
his
pocket
and
finding
some
papers
in
it
he
had
stuffed
them
without
foresight
or
method
into
his
victim
mouth
all
eagerness
as
he
was
to
hear
those
terrible
cries
no
more
but
they
had
begun
again
and
he
told
how
he
had
then
murdered
strangled
the
boy
pressing
his
strong
bony
hairy
fingers
like
iron
bands
around
the
child
delicate
neck
and
marking
it
with
deep
dark
furrows
god
he
cried
am
a
hog
i
am
a
murderous
brute
my
limbs
are
stained
with
mire
and
blood
and
i
fled
like
a
wretched
coward
without
an
idea
in
my
head
quite
brutified
and
senseless
leaving
the
window
open
and
thereby
showing
my
stupidity
and
the
innocence
in
which
i
should
have
remained
but
for
the
devil
unforeseen
and
victorious
assault
upon
me
and
now
that
i
have
confessed
everything
to
men
o
god
i
beg
thee
in
reward
for
my
penitence
open
to
me
the
doors
of
heaven
but
the
patience
of
the
crowd
was
now
exhausted
after
the
stupor
which
had
kept
it
chilled
and
mute
there
came
an
outburst
of
extraordinary
violence
a
loud
roar
of
imprecations
rolled
from
one
to
the
other
end
of
the
square
a
huge
wave
gathered
and
bounded
towards
the
railings
towards
the
impudent
wretch
the
monstrous
penitent
who
in
his
religious
dementia
had
thus
dared
to
proclaim
his
crime
in
the
full
sunlight
shouts
arose
death
with
the
scoundrel
to
death
with
the
murderer
to
death
with
the
polluter
and
killer
of
children
and
marc
then
understood
the
terrible
danger
he
pictured
the
crowd
lynching
that
wretched
man
in
its
craving
for
immediate
justice
he
beheld
that
festival
of
kindness
and
solidarity
that
triumph
of
truth
and
equity
soiled
blackened
by
the
summary
execution
of
the
culprit
whose
limbs
would
be
torn
from
him
and
cast
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
so
in
all
haste
he
strove
to
remove
gorgias
from
the
railings
but
he
had
to
contend
with
his
resistance
for
the
obstinate
frantic
scoundrel
desired
to
say
something
more
at
last
helped
by
the
vigorous
arms
of
some
of
the
bystanders
marc
managed
to
carry
him
into
the
garden
the
gate
of
which
was
at
once
shut
the
rescue
was
effected
none
too
soon
for
the
huge
wave
of
the
indignant
crowd
rolled
up
and
burst
against
the
railings
which
fortunately
checked
its
further
progress
as
they
were
new
and
strong
thus
gorgias
was
for
the
moment
out
of
reach
sheltered
by
the
very
house
which
had
been
built
for
the
innocent
man
for
whose
tortures
he
was
responsible
and
such
was
his
obstinacy
that
when
those
who
had
seized
him
released
their
hold
thinking
him
conquered
he
picked
himself
up
and
rushing
back
to
the
railings
hung
to
them
from
inside
and
there
protected
by
the
iron
bars
against
which
the
furious
surging
throng
was
sweeping
he
began
once
more
didst
witness
o
god
my
first
expiation
when
my
superiors
as
foolish
as
they
were
cruel
abandoned
me
on
the
road
to
exile
thou
knowest
to
what
unacknowledgeable
callings
they
reduced
me
what
fresh
and
hateful
transgressions
they
caused
me
to
commit
thou
knowest
their
base
avarice
how
they
refused
me
even
a
crust
of
bread
how
they
refuse
it
still
after
being
my
counsellors
and
accomplices
all
my
life
long
for
thou
wert
always
present
o
god
thou
didst
hear
them
bind
themselves
to
me
thou
knowest
that
after
my
crime
i
did
but
obey
them
and
that
if
i
aggravated
it
by
other
crimes
it
was
only
by
and
for
them
doubtless
the
desire
was
to
save
thy
holy
church
from
scandal
and
i
indeed
would
have
given
my
blood
my
life
but
they
thought
only
of
saving
their
own
skins
and
it
is
that
which
has
enraged
me
and
stirred
me
to
tell
everything
and
now
o
god
that
i
have
been
thy
justiciary
that
i
have
spoken
the
words
of
violence
ordained
by
thee
and
have
cried
aloud
their
unknown
and
unpunished
sins
it
is
for
thee
to
decide
if
thou
wilt
pardon
them
or
strike
them
down
in
thy
wrath
even
before
these
swinish
people
who
pretend
to
forget
thy
name
and
for
the
roasting
of
whose
sacrilegious
limbs
there
will
never
be
room
enough
in
hell
threatening
hoots
interrupted
him
at
every
word
stones
passing
from
hand
to
hand
began
to
fly
around
his
head
the
railings
would
not
have
resisted
much
longer
in
fact
a
last
great
onrush
was
about
to
throw
them
down
when
marc
and
his
assistants
again
managed
to
seize
gorgias
and
carry
him
to
the
end
of
the
garden
behind
the
house
on
that
side
there
was
a
little
gate
conducting
to
a
deserted
lane
and
the
miscreant
was
soon
led
forth
and
then
driven
away
if
however
the
growling
threatening
crowd
suddenly
became
calm
it
was
because
cries
of
joy
and
glorification
arose
above
the
shouts
of
anger
drawing
nearer
every
moment
in
sonorous
waves
along
the
sunlit
avenue
simon
having
been
received
at
the
railway
station
by
a
deputation
of
the
municipal
council
was
arriving
in
a
large
landau
he
and
david
occupying
the
back
seat
while
in
front
of
them
were
advocate
delbos
and
jules
savin
the
mayor
as
the
carriage
slowly
advanced
between
the
serried
crowd
there
came
an
extraordinary
ovation
spurred
to
it
by
the
abominable
scene
which
had
left
everybody
quivering
they
acclaimed
simon
with
the
wildest
enthusiasm
for
his
innocence
and
his
heroism
seemed
to
have
been
rendered
yet
more
glorious
by
the
public
confession
now
made
by
the
real
culprit
the
savage
and
bestial
gorgias
women
wept
and
raised
their
children
to
let
them
see
the
hero
men
rushed
to
unharness
the
horses
and
indeed
they
did
unharness
them
in
such
wise
that
the
landau
was
dragged
to
the
house
by
a
hundred
brave
arms
and
all
along
the
line
of
route
other
flowers
were
flung
from
the
windows
where
handkerchiefs
as
well
as
banners
waved
a
very
beautiful
girl
mounted
the
carriage
step
and
remained
there
like
a
living
statue
of
youth
contributing
the
splendour
of
her
beauty
to
the
martyr
triumph
kisses
were
wafted
words
of
affection
and
glorification
fell
into
the
carriage
with
the
bouquets
which
rained
from
every
side
never
had
people
been
stirred
by
such
intense
emotion
emotion
wrung
from
their
very
vitals
by
the
thought
of
such
a
great
iniquity
emotion
which
seeking
to
bestow
some
supreme
compensation
on
the
victim
found
it
in
the
gift
without
reserve
of
the
hearts
and
love
of
all
glory
to
the
innocent
man
who
had
perished
by
the
people
fault
and
on
whom
the
people
would
never
be
able
to
bestow
sufficient
happiness
glory
to
the
martyr
who
had
suffered
so
greatly
for
unrecognised
and
strangled
truth
and
whose
victory
was
that
of
human
reason
freeing
itself
from
the
bonds
of
error
and
falsehood
and
glory
to
the
schoolmaster
struck
down
in
his
functions
a
victim
of
his
efforts
to
promote
enlightenment
and
now
exalted
the
more
as
he
had
suffered
untold
pain
and
grief
for
each
and
every
particle
of
truth
that
he
had
imparted
to
the
ignorant
and
the
humble
marc
who
stood
on
the
threshold
of
the
house
dizzy
with
happiness
watching
that
triumph
approach
amid
an
explosion
of
fraternity
and
affection
bethought
himself
of
the
day
of
simon
arrest
the
hateful
day
when
a
vehicle
had
carried
him
away
from
maillebois
at
the
moment
of
little
zéphirin
funeral
a
furious
crowd
had
rushed
to
seize
him
roll
him
in
the
mud
and
tear
him
to
pieces
a
horrible
clamour
had
arisen
death
to
death
with
the
assassin
and
sacrilegist
to
death
to
death
with
the
jew
and
the
crowd
had
pursued
the
rolling
wheels
unwilling
to
relinquish
its
prey
while
simon
pale
and
frozen
responded
with
his
ceaseless
cry
am
innocent
i
am
innocent
i
am
innocent
and
now
that
after
long
years
that
innocence
was
manifest
how
striking
was
the
transformation
the
crowd
was
rejuvenated
transfigured
the
children
and
the
grandchildren
of
the
blind
insulters
of
former
days
had
grown
up
in
knowledge
of
truth
and
become
enthusiastic
applauders
striving
by
dint
of
sincerity
and
affection
to
redeem
the
crime
of
their
forerunners
but
the
landau
drew
up
before
the
garden
gate
and
the
emotion
increased
when
simon
was
seen
to
alight
with
the
help
of
his
brother
david
who
had
remained
more
nimble
and
vigorous
emaciated
reduced
to
a
shadow
simon
had
white
hair
and
a
gentle
countenance
softened
by
extreme
age
he
smiled
his
thanks
to
david
and
again
there
were
frantic
acclamations
at
the
sight
of
those
two
brothers
bound
together
by
long
years
of
heroism
the
cheers
continued
when
after
the
mayor
jules
savin
delbos
also
alighted
the
great
delbos
as
the
crowd
called
him
the
hero
of
beaumont
and
rozan
who
had
not
feared
to
speak
the
truth
aloud
in
the
terrible
days
when
it
was
perilous
to
do
so
and
who
ever
since
had
worked
for
the
advent
of
a
just
society
then
as
marc
went
forward
to
meet
simon
and
david
whom
delbos
had
just
joined
the
four
men
found
themselves
together
for
a
moment
on
the
very
threshold
of
the
house
and
at
that
sight
there
came
an
increase
of
enthusiasm
cries
were
raised
and
arms
were
waved
deliriously
as
the
three
heroic
defenders
and
the
innocent
man
whom
they
had
rescued
from
the
worst
of
tortures
were
seen
thus
standing
side
by
side
then
simon
impulsively
cast
himself
on
the
neck
of
marc
who
returned
his
embrace
both
sobbed
and
were
only
able
to
stammer
a
few
words
almost
the
same
as
they
had
stammered
long
ago
on
the
abominable
day
when
they
had
been
parted
you
thank
you
comrade
like
david
you
have
been
to
me
a
brother
a
second
brother
you
saved
my
own
and
my
children
honour
i
merely
helped
david
comrade
the
victory
was
won
by
truth
alone
and
there
are
your
children
of
their
own
accord
they
have
grown
up
in
strength
and
reason
the
whole
family
indeed
was
assembled
amid
the
garden
greenery
four
generations
awaited
the
venerable
old
man
who
triumphed
after
so
many
years
of
suffering
rachel
his
wife
stood
beside
geneviève
the
wife
of
his
dear
good
friend
then
came
those
whose
blood
had
mingled
joseph
and
louise
sarah
and
sébastien
accompanied
by
their
children
françois
and
thérèse
who
were
followed
by
little
rose
the
last
born
of
the
line
clément
and
charlotte
were
also
present
with
lucienne
and
tears
started
from
all
eyes
and
endless
kisses
were
exchanged
but
a
very
fresh
sweet
song
arose
the
children
of
the
boys
and
girls
schools
the
pupils
of
joseph
and
louise
were
singing
a
welcome
to
the
former
schoolmaster
of
maillebois
nothing
could
have
been
more
simple
and
more
touching
than
that
childish
strophe
instinct
with
tenderness
and
suggestive
of
the
happy
future
then
a
lad
stepped
forward
and
offered
simon
a
bouquet
in
the
name
of
the
boys
school

came
the
turn
of
a

in
like
fashion
carried

increase
of

life
bring
as

pursues
its
eternal
task
they
were
now
all
pressing
around
him
introducing
themselves
embracing
him
and
shaking
his
hands
there
were
the
savins
jules
and
his
son

actively

and
all
were
mingled
connected
by
marriages
forming
as
it
were
but
one
great
family
in
such
wise
that
simon
could
hardly
tell
who
was
who
but
his
old
pupils
gave
their
names
and
he
traced
on
their
aged
faces
some
likeness
to
the
boyish
features
of
long
ago
while
embrace
followed
embrace
amid
emotion
and
all
at
once
finding
himself
in
presence
of
salvan
now
very
old
indeed
but
still
showing
a
smiling
countenance
simon
fell
into
his
arms
saying
my
master
i
owe
everything
to
you
it
is
your
work
which
now
triumphs
thanks
to
the
valiant
artisans
of
truth
whom
you
formed
and
sent
out
into
the
world
then
came
the
turn
of
mademoiselle
mazeline
whom
he
kissed
gaily
on
both
cheeks
and
next
that
of
mignot
who
shed
tears
when
simon
had
embraced
him
you
forgiven
me
monsieur
simon
he
asked
you
my
old
friend
mignot
you
have
shown
a
valiant
and
noble
heart
ah
how
delightful
it
is
to
meet
again
like
this
the
ceremony
so
simple
yet
so
grand
was
at
last
drawing
to
a
close
the
house
offered
to
the
innocent
man
that
house
standing
on
the
site
of
the
old
den
of
the
rue
du
trou
smiled
right
gaily
in
the
sunlight
with
its
decorative
garlands
of
flowers
and
foliage
and
all
at
once
the
drapery
which
still
hung
before
the
inscription
above
the
door
was
pulled
aside
and
the
marble
slab
appeared
with
its
inscription
in
vivid
letters
of
gold
by
the
town
of
maillebois
to
schoolmaster
simon
in
the
name
of
truth
and
justice
and
as
reparation
for
the
torture
inflicted
on
him
then
came
the
signature
which
seemed
to
show
forth
in
a
yet
brighter
blaze
grandchildren
of
his
persecutors
and
at
that
sight
from
all
the
great
square
and
from
the
neighbouring
avenue
from
every
window
and
from
every
roof
there
arose
a
last
mighty
acclamation
which
rolled
on
like
thunder
an
acclamation
in
which
all
at
last
united
none
henceforth
daring
to
deny
that
truth
and
justice
had
triumphed
on
the
morrow
petit
published
an
enthusiastic
account
of
the
ceremony
that
once
filthy
print
had
been
quite
transformed
by
the
new
spirit
which
had
raised
its
readers
both
morally
and
intellectually
its
offices
so
long
infected
by
poison
had
been
swept
and
purged
the
press
will
indeed
become
a
most
admirable
instrument
of
education
when
it
is
no
longer
as
now
in
the
hands
of
political
and
financial
bandits
bent
on
debasing
and
plundering
their
readers
and
thus
petit
cleansed
and
rejuvenated
was
beginning
to
render
great
services
contributing
day
by
day
to
increase
of
enlightenment
reason
and
brotherliness
a
few
days
later
a
terrible
storm
one
of
those
september
storms
which
consume
everything
destroyed
the
capuchin
chapel
at
maillebois
that
chapel
was
the
last
religious
edifice
of
the
district
remaining
open
and
several
bigots
still
attended
it
at
jonville
abbé
cognasse
had
lately
been
found
dead
in
his
sacristy
carried
off
by
an
apoplectic
stroke
which
had
followed
one
of
his
violent
fits
of
anger
and
his
church
long
empty
was
now
definitively
closed
at
maillebois
abbé
coquard
no
longer
even
opened
the
doors
of
martin
but
officiated
alone
at
the
altar
unable
as
he
was
to
find
a
server
for
the
mass
thus
the
little
chapel
of
the
capuchins
which
with
its
big
gilded
and
painted
statue
of
antony
of
padua
standing
amid
candles
and
artificial
flowers
retained
to
the
end
its
reputation
as
a
sufficed
for
the
few
folk
who
still
followed
the
observances
of
the
church
that
day
as
it
happened
they
were
celebrating
there
some
festival
connected
with
the
saint
a
ceremony
which
had
attracted
about
a
hundred
of
the
faithful
yielding
to
the
solicitations
of
father
théodose
father
crabot
who
nowadays
remained
shut
up
at
la
désirade
where
he
intended
to
install
some
pious
enterprise
had
decided
to
honour
the
solemnity
with
his
presence
thus
both
were
there
one
officiating
the
other
seated
in
a
velvet
before
the
statue
of
the
great
saint
who
was
implored
to
show
his
miraculous
power
and
obtain
from
god
the
grace
of
some
dreadful
cataclysm
such
as
would
at
once
sweep
away
the
infamous
and
sacrilegious
society
of
the
new
times
and
it
was
then
that
the
storm
burst
forth
a
great
inky
terrifying
cloud
spread
over
maillebois
there
came
flashes
of
lightning
which
seemed
to
show
the
furnaces
of
hell
blazing
in
the
empyrean
and
thunderclaps
which
suggested
salvoes
of
some
giant
artillery
bombarding
the
earth
father
théodose
had
ordered
the
bells
to
be
rung
and
a
loud
and
prolonged
pealing
arose
from
the
chapel
as
if
to
indicate
to
the
deity
that
this
was
his
house
and
should
be
protected
by
him
but
in
lieu
thereof
extermination
came
a
frightful
clap
resounded
the
lightning
struck
the
bells
descended
by
the
rope
and
burst
forth
in
the
nave
with
a
detonation
as
if
the
very
heavens
were
crumbling
father
théodose
fired
as
he
stood
at
the
altar
flamed
there
like
a
torch
the
sacerdotal
vestments
the
sacred
vases
the
very
tabernacle
were
melted
reduced
to
ashes
and
the
great
antony
shivered
to
pieces
fell
upon
the
stricken
father
crabot
of
whom
only
a
bent
and
blackened
skeleton
remained
beneath
all
the
dust
and
as
if
those
two
ministers
of
the
church
were
not
sufficient
sacrifice
five
of
the
devotees
present
were
also
killed
while
the
others
fled
howling
with
terror
eager
to
escape
being
crushed
by
the
vaulted
roof
which
cracked
then
crumbled
in
a
pile
of
remnants
leaving
nought
of
the
cult
intact
footnote
the
real
festival
of
antony
of
padua
falls
on
june
the
stupefaction
was
universal
throughout
maillebois
how
could
the
deity
of
the
holy
roman
and
apostolic
church
have
made
such
a
mistake
the
same
question
had
often
been
asked
in
former
times
each
time
indeed
that
a
church
had
been
struck
and
its
steeple
had
fallen
on
the
priest
and
the
kneeling
worshippers
had
god
desired
then
the
end
of
the
religion
which
had
taken
his
name
or
more
reasonably
was
it
that
no
divine
hand
whatever
guided
the
lightning
and
that
it
was
but
a
natural
force
which
would
prove
a
source
of
happiness
whenever
mankind
should
have
domesticated
it
in
any
case
after
the
calamity
brother
gorgias
suddenly
reappeared
and
was
seen
hurrying
along
the
streets
of
maillebois
crying
aloud
that
god
had
made
no
mistake
it
was
to
him
he
said
that
god
had
hearkened
resolving
to
strike
down
his
imbecile
and
cowardly
superiors
and
thus
give
a
lesson
to
the
whole
church
which
could
only
flourish
anew
by
the
power
of
fire
and
steel
and
a
month
later
gorgias
himself
was
found
his
skull
split
his
body
soiled
with
filth
outside
the
same
suspicious
house
before
which
some
time
previously
a
passer
had
already
found
the
body
of
victor
milhomme
iv
years
and
again
years
elapsed
and
thanks
to
the
generosity
of
life
which
as
marc
had
lived
and
served
it
so
well
wished
it
seemed
to
reward
him
by
keeping
him
and
his
adored
geneviève
erect
like
triumphant
spectators
he
now
over
eighty
still
tasted
the
supreme
joy
of
seeing
his
dreams
fulfilled
yet
more
and
more
generations
continued
to
arise
each
more
freed
more
purified
more
endowed
with
knowledge
than
its
forerunners
in
former
days
there
had
been
two
frances
each
receiving
a
different
education
remaining
ignorant
of
the
other
hating
it
and
contending
with
it
for
the
multitude
of
the
nation
for
the
immense
majority
of
the
country
folk
there
had
only
been
what
was
called
elementary
instruction
reading
writing
a
little
arithmetic
the
rudiments
which
raised
man
just
a
span
above
the
level
of
the
brute
beast
to
the
the
petty
minority
of
the
elect
who
had
seized
all
wealth
and
power
secondary
education
and
superior
education
every
means
of
learning
and
reigning
lay
open
thus
was
perpetuated
the
most
frightful
of
all
social
iniquities
the
poor
and
the
humble
were
kept
down
in
their
ignorance
beneath
a
heavy
tombstone
to
them
it
was
forbidden
to
learn
to
become
men
of
knowledge
power
and
mastery
at
rare
intervals
one
of
them
escaped
and
raised
himself
to
the
highest
rank
but
that
was
the
exception
tolerated
and
cited
with
canting
hypocrisy
as
an
example
all
men
were
equal
it
was
said
and
might
raise
themselves
by
their
own
merits
but
as
a
first
step
by
way
of
preventing
it
the
necessary
instruction
the
enlightenment
due
to
each
and
every
child
of
the
nation
was
withheld
from
the
great
majority
so
intense
indeed
was
the
terror
of
the
great
movement
of
truth
and
justice
which
would
accrue
from
the
diffusion
of
knowledge
a
movement
which
would
sweep
away
the
and
its
monstrous
errors
and
compel
disgorgement
of
the
national
fortune
in
order
that
by
just
labour
the
city
of
solidarity
and
peace
might
be
at
last
established
and
now
a
france
which
soon
would
be
all
one
was
being
constituted
there
would
soon
be
no
upper
class
no
lower
class
those
who
knew
would
cease
to
crush
and
exploit
those
who
did
not
know
in
a
stealthy
fratricidal
warfare
whose
paroxysms
had
often
reddened
the
paving
of
the
streets
with
blood
a
system
of
integral
education
for
one
and
all
was
already
at
work
all
the
children
of
france
had
to
pass
through
the
gratuitous
secular
compulsory
primary
schools
where
experimental
facts
in
lieu
of
grammatical
rules
were
now
the
bases
of
all
education
moreover
the
acquirement
of
knowledge
did
not
suffice
it
was
necessary
one
should
learn
to
love
for
it
was
only
by
love
that
truth
could
prove
fruitful
and
a
process
of
natural
selection
ensued
according
to
the
tastes
aptitudes
and
faculties
of
the
pupils
who
from
the
primary
schools
passed
to
special
schools
arranged
in
accordance
with
requirements
embracing
all
practical
applications
of
knowledge
and
extending
to
the
highest
speculations
of
the
human
mind
the
law
was
that
no
member
of
a
nation
was
privileged
that
each
being
born
into
the
world
was
to
be
welcomed
as
a
possible
force
whose
culture
was
demanded
by
the
national
interests
and
in
this
there
was
not
only
equality
and
equity
but
a
wise
employment
of
the
common
treasure
a
practical
desire
to
lose
nought
that
might
contribute
to
the
power
and
grandeur
of
the
country
and
indeed
what
a
mighty
awakening
there
was
of
all
the
accumulated
energy
which
had
lain
slumbering
in
the
country
districts
and
the
industrial
towns
quite
an
intellectual
florescence
sprang
up
a
new
generation
able
to
act
and
think
supplying
the
sap
which
had
long
been
exhausted
in
the
old
governing
classes
worn
out
by
the
abuse
of
power
genius
arose
daily
from
the
fertile
popular
soil
a
great
epoch
a
renascence
of
mankind
was
impending
integral
instruction
which
the
ruling
had
so
long
opposed
because
it
felt
that
it
would
destroy
the
old
social
order
was
indeed
destroying
it
but
at
the
same
time
it
was
setting
in
its
place
the
fresh
and
magnificent
blossoming
of
all
the
intellectual
and
moral
power
which
would
make
france
the
liberator
the
emancipator
of
the
world
thus
disappeared
the
divided
france
of
former
times
the
france
in
which
there
had
been
two
classes
two
hostile
races
reared
it
might
have
been
thought
in
different
planets
as
if
they
were
destined
never
to
meet
never
to
come
to
an
agreement
the
schoolmasters
also
were
no
longer
herded
in
two
unfriendly
groups
the
one
full
of
humiliation
the
other
full
of
contempt
on
one
side
the
poor
imperfectly
educated
elementary
teachers
scarcely
cleansed
of
the
loam
of
their
native
fields
and
on
the
other
the
professors
of
the
lycées
and
the
special
schools
redolent
of
science
and
literature
the
masters
who
now
taught
the
pupils
of
the
primary
schools
followed
them
through
all
the
stages
of
their
education
it
was
held
that
a
man
needed
as
much
intelligence
and
training
to
be
able
to
awaken
a
mind
impart
first
principles
and
set
him
on
the
right
road
as
to
maintain
him
in
it
and
develop
his
faculties
subsequently
a
rotatory
service
was
organised
teachers
were
easily
recruited
and
worked
right
zealously
now
that
the
profession
had
become
one
of
the
first
of
the
land
well
paid
honoured
and
glorified
the
nation
had
also
understood
it
to
be
necessary
that
the
integral
instruction
it
imparted
should
be
gratuitous
at
all
stages
however
great
might
be
the
cost
for
its
millions
were
not
cast
stupidly
to
the
winds
to
foster
falsehood
and
slaughter
they
helped
to
rear
good
artisans
of
prosperity
and
peace
no
other
harvest
could
be
compared
with
that
each
that
was
expended
helped
to
give
more
intelligence
and
strength
to
the
people
helped
it
to
master
and
the
inanity
of
the
great
reproach
levelled
at
the
general
diffusion
of
knowledge
that
of
casting
rebels
across
the
narrow
limits
of
society
became
plainly
manifest
now
that
those
limits
had
crumbled
as
the
new
society
came
into
being
the
even
as
it
feared
was
bound
to
be
swept
away
as
soon
as
it
no
longer
possessed
a
monopoly
of
knowledge
but
if
in
former
years
each
penniless
and
hungry
peasant
or
artisan
son
who
rose
up
by
the
acquirement
of
knowledge
had
become
a
source
of
embarrassment
and
danger
by
reason
of
his
eagerness
to
carve
for
himself
a
share
of
enjoyment
among
that
of
those
who
enjoyed
already
that
danger
had
now
disappeared
there
could
be
no
more
since
the
classes
themselves
had
ceased
to
exist
and
no
more
rebels
either
since
the
normal
condition
of
life
was
the
ascent
of
one
and
all
towards
more
and
more
culture
in
order
that
the
most
useful
civic
action
might
ensue
thus
education
had
accomplished
its
revolutionary
work
and
it
was
now
the
very
strength
of
the
community
the
power
which
had
both
broadened
and
tightened
the
bond
of
brotherliness
all
being
called
upon
to
work
for
the
happiness
of
all
the
energy
of
none
remaining
ignored
and
lost
that
complete
education
the
culture
of
the
whole
community
which
now
yielded
such
a
magnificent
harvest
had
only
become
possible
on
the
day
when
the
church
had
been
deprived
of
her
teaching
privileges
the
separation
of
church
and
state
and
the
suppression
of
the
budget
of
public
worship
had
freed
the
country
and
enabled
it
to
dower
its
schools
more
liberally
the
priest
ceased
to
be
a
functionary
the
catholic
faith
no
longer
possessed
the
force
of
a
law
those
who
chose
remained
free
to
go
to
church
even
as
to
the
theatre
by
paying
for
their
seats
but
in
the
result
the
churches
gradually
emptied
and
if
this
occurred
it
was
because
they
no
longer
manufactured
worshippers
poor
stupefied
beings
such
as
they
needed
to
fill
their
naves
long
and
terrible
years
had
elapsed
before
it
had
become
possible
to
wrest
the
children
from
the
teachers
of
the
church
those
who
had
poisoned
mankind
through
the
ages
who
had
reigned
over
it
by
falsehood
and
terrorism
from
the
very
first
day
the
church
had
realised
that
she
must
kill
truth
if
she
did
not
wish
it
to
kill
her
and
what
furious
battles
had
followed
what
a
desperate
resistance
she
had
offered
in
order
to
delay
her
inevitable
defeat
the
resplendent
outpouring
of
light
freed
at
last
from
every
hindrance
society
would
soon
be
reduced
to
treating
her
as
one
treated
those
malodorous
fishwives
whose
shops
were
closed
by
the
police
yet
she
the
dogmatic
and
authoritarian
ruler
she
who
imitating
her
deity
strove
to
impose
her
will
on
the
world
by
thunderbolts
impudently
dared
to
invoke
and
claim
liberty
in
order
that
she
might
perpetuate
her
abominable
work
of
debasement
and
servitude
laws
of
social
protection
then
proved
necessary
it
became
imperative
to
deprive
her
legally
of
her
power
by
refusing
to
her
members
the
monks
and
the
priests
the
right
of
teaching
and
then
again
what
an
uproar
followed
what
frantic
attempts
to
plunge
france
into
civil
war
credulous
parents
being
banded
together
while
the
religious
orders
thrust
out
by
the
doorways
once
more
slipped
into
their
dens
by
the
windows
with
the
obstinacy
of
folk
who
relied
on
the
eternal
credulity
which
they
fancied
they
had
sown
in
the
minds
of
men
did
they
not
represent
error
superstition
and
wretched
human
cowardice
and
did
it
not
follow
therefore
that
eternity
was
theirs
but
for
this
to
be
they
had
to
retain
their
hold
upon
the
children
and
by
them
obscure
the
morrow
and
it
happened
that
the
morrow
and
the
children
gradually
escaped
them
and
that
the
time
came
when
the
holy
roman
catholic
church
lay
agonising
beneath
the
crumbling
of
her
idiotic
dogmas
pierced
and
destroyed
by
science
truth
had
conquered
the
schools
given
to
all
had
formed
men
who
knew
and
who
could
exercise
their
will
thus
hardly
a
day
elapsed
without
marc
observing
some
fresh
fortunate
conquest
some
increase
of
reason
and
comfort
he
and
his
wife
geneviève
alone
remained
erect
of
all
the
valiant
generation
which
had
fought
and
suffered
so
much
good
old
salvan
had
been
the
first
to
depart
then
mademoiselle
mazeline
and
mignot
had
followed
him
but
of
all
the
deaths
the
most
painful
for
marc
had
been
those
of
simon
and
david
the
two
brothers
carried
off
one
after
the
other
at
an
interval
of
only
a
few
days
as
if
they
had
been
still
linked
together
by
their
heroic
fraternity
madame
simon
had
preceded
them
all
who
had
participated
in
the
monstrous
affair
were
now
beneath
the
peaceful
soil
lying
there
side
by
side
the
good
and
the
wicked
the
heroes
and
the
criminals
all
plunged
in
eternal
silence
many
of
the
children
and
grandchildren
moreover
had
departed
before
their
parents
for
death
never
paused
in
his
mysterious
work
mowing
down
men
as
he
listed
in
order
to
fertilise
one
or
another
field
whence
other
men
would
spring
at
last
quitting
their
retreat
of
jonville
marc
and
geneviève
had
come
to
reside
again
at
maillebois
where
they
occupied
the
first
floor
of
the
house
presented
to
simon
and
now
belonging
to
his
children
joseph
and
sarah
she
and
her
husband
sébastien
still
resided
at
beaumont
where
the
latter
remained
director
of
the
training
college
but
joseph
afflicted
in
the
legs
almost
infirm
had
been
obliged
to
retire
and
as
his
wife
louise
had
at
the
same
time
quitted
the
maillebois
school
they
were
now
installed
on
the
second
floor
of
the
paternal
house
which
the
family
shared
in
this
fashion
well
pleased
to
be
together
during
the
last
gentle
declining
days
of
life
and
if
they
themselves
had
given
up
teaching
they
at
least
had
the
joy
of
seeing
the
good
work
carried
on
by
their
descendants
for
françois
and
thérèse
had
now
been
appointed
to
the
maillebois
schools
in
which
therefore
three
generations
of
the
family
had
succeeded
one
another
the
delight
of
living
side
by
side
in
close
affection
had
lasted
two
years
when
quite
a
drama
plunged
the
family
into
grief
one
of
those
insensate
passions
which
devastate
a
man
came
upon
françois
then
in
all
the
strength
of
his
two
and
thirty
years
and
hitherto
so
tenderly
attached
to
his
wife
thérèse
he
became
enamoured
of
a
young
woman
of
eight
and
twenty
years
named
colette
roudille
whose
mother
a
very
pious
widow
had
lately
died
colette
father
was
said
to
have
been
théodose
the
capuchin
at
one
time
her
mother
confessor
and
she
certainly
resembled
him
having
a
splendid
head
with
lips
and
eyes
of
fire
the
widow
had
lived
on
a
little
income
upon
which
however
her
son
faustin
twelve
years
older
than
his
sister
had
encroached
to
such
a
degree
that
the
old
woman
had
remained
at
last
with
barely
enough
money
to
buy
bread
however
the
little
clerical
group
all
that
remained
of
the
once
powerful
faction
which
had
ruled
the
district
took
an
interest
in
faustin
and
ended
by
obtaining
a
situation
for
him
for
some
months
then
he
had
been
keeper
of
the
estate
of
la
désirade
which
since
father
crabot
death
had
become
the
subject
of
a
number
of
lawsuits
and
which
some
of
the
neighbouring
localities
proposed
to
purchase
and
turn
into
a
people
palace
and
convalescent
home
even
as
valmarie
had
been
turned
into
an
asylum
where
young
mothers
recovered
their
strength
thus
colette
lived
alone
and
in
all
freedom
at
maillebois
almost
in
front
of
the
school
and
it
was
certain
that
the
glow
of
her
fine
eyes
and
the
smile
of
her
red
lips
had
largely
helped
on
the
passion
which
was
maddening
françois
but
it
happened
that
one
day
thérèse
surprised
them
and
dolorous
anger
came
upon
her
the
more
particularly
as
she
was
not
the
only
one
who
might
suffer
from
her
husband
folly
might
it
not
indeed
prove
a
disaster
for
their
daughter
rose
who
was
now
near
her
twelfth
birthday
at
one
moment
thérèse
appealed
to
her
parents
sébastien
and
sarah
wishing
to
have
their
views
respecting
the
course
she
ought
to
take
she
spoke
of
a
separation
offering
to
restore
freedom
to
the
husband
who
had
ceased
to
love
her
and
who
told
her
lies
but
she
remained
very
calm
firm
and
sensible
in
her
trouble
and
she
soon
understood
that
on
this
occasion
it
was
wise
and
fit
to
forgive
moreover
marc
and
geneviève
afflicted
by
the
rupture
lectured
their
grandson
françois
severely
and
he
evinced
great
sorrow
recognising
that
he
was
in
the
wrong
and
accepting
the
most
violent
reproaches
but
even
while
he
confessed
his
fault
he
unhappily
remained
disturbed
full
of
anguish
with
an
evident
fear
that
his
passion
might
again
overcome
him
never
had
marc
so
cruelly
realised
the
fragility
of
human
happiness
it
was
not
sufficient
then
that
one
should
instruct
men
and
lead
them
towards
justice
by
the
paths
of
truth
it
was
also
necessary
that
passion
should
not
rend
them
and
cast
them
one
against
the
other
like
madmen
marc
had
spent
his
life
fighting
in
order
that
a
little
light
might
extricate
the
children
from
the
dim
gaol
in
which
their
fathers
had
groaned
and
in
giving
more
happiness
to
others
he
thought
he
had
given
it
to
his
own
family
yet
now
at
the
hearth
of
his
grandson
who
had
seemed
quite
freed
from
error
and
very
sensible
another
form
of
suffering
displayed
itself
the
suffering
of
love
with
its
eternal
felicity
and
eternal
torture
it
was
evident
that
one
must
not
be
proud
of
one
knowledge
that
one
must
not
set
all
strength
in
it
it
was
necessary
that
one
should
also
be
prepared
to
suffer
in
one
heart
and
strive
to
make
it
valiant
in
order
that
it
might
bear
up
against
a
rending
which
always
remained
possible
and
again
it
was
wrong
to
think
that
it
was
sufficient
to
do
good
in
order
to
be
sheltered
from
the
blows
of
evil
but
though
marc
said
all
those
things
to
himself
placing
a
very
modest
estimate
on
the
work
he
had
accomplished
he
still
felt
very
sad
as
he
saw
mankind
voluntarily
leaving
some
of
its
flesh
on
all
the
briars
of
its
path
and
lingering
there
as
if
unwilling
to
reach
the
happy
city
the
holidays
arrived
and
all
at
once
françois
disappeared
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
waited
to
be
rid
of
his
pupils
in
order
to
go
off
with
colette
the
shutters
of
whose
windows
facing
the
high
street
remained
closed
wishing
to
stifle
the
scandal
the
family
related
that
as
françois
was
in
poor
health
he
had
gone
with
a
friend
to
take
an
air
cure
abroad
during
the
holidays
a
tacit
understanding
ensued
in
maillebois
everybody
pretended
to
accept
that
explanation
out
of
regard
for
thérèse
the
forsaken
wife
who
was
much
liked
and
respected
but
nobody
really
remained
ignorant
of
the
true
cause
of
her
husband
flight
she
behaved
admirably
in
those
painful
circumstances
hiding
her
tears
preserving
perfect
dignity
in
her
home
in
particular
she
bestowed
increased
tenderness
on
her
daughter
rose
from
whom
unfortunately
she
could
not
hide
the
facts
but
in
whom
she
inculcated
a
continuance
of
respect
for
her
father
in
spite
of
his
bad
conduct
a
month
went
by
and
marc
who
was
deeply
grieved
still
visited
thérèse
every
day
when
one
evening
there
came
a
dramatic
a
horrible
occurrence
rose
having
gone
to
spend
the
afternoon
with
a
little
friend
in
the
neighbourhood
marc
had
found
thérèse
alone
sobbing
in
silence
far
away
from
all
prying
eyes
for
a
long
while
he
strove
to
comfort
her
and
restore
her
to
some
hope
then
at
nightfall
he
was
obliged
to
leave
her
without
having
seen
rose
who
had
remained
apparently
with
her
little
friend
the
evening
was
dark
the
atmosphere
heavy
with
a
threatening
storm
and
as
marc
eager
to
get
home
was
crossing
the
small
dim
square
behind
the
school
into
which
looked
the
window
of
the
room
once
occupied
by
little
zéphirin
he
suddenly
heard
a
confused
noise
of
footsteps
and
calls
is
the
matter
what
is
the
matter
he
exclaimed
as
he
went
forward
he
felt
a
chill
in
his
veins
though
why
it
was
he
could
not
tell
apparently
some
gust
of
terror
coming
from
afar
was
sweeping
by
and
at
last
in
the
faint
light
marc
perceived
a
man
whom
he
recognised
as
a
certain
marsouillier
a
poor
nephew
of
the
deceased
philis
at
one
time
mayor
of
maillebois
marsouillier
now
acted
as
beadle
at
martin
where
since
the
destruction
of
the
capuchin
chapel
a
small
party
of
believers
still
supported
a
priest
is
the
matter
marc
repeated
surprised
to
see
that
the
other
was
gesticulating
and
mumbling
to
himself
marsouillier
in
his
turn
now
recognised
marc
do
know
monsieur
froment
he
stammered
with
a
terrified
air
was
passing
i
had
come
from
the
place
des
capucins
when
all
at
once
i
heard
the
cries
of
a
child
choking
it
seemed
with
fright
and
as
i
hastened
up
i
just
caught
sight
of
a
man
running
away
while
yonder
on
the
ground
lay
that
little
body
then
i
also
began
to
call
marc
himself
now
distinguished
a
pale
and
motionless
form
lying
on
the
ground
and
a
suspicion
came
to
him
was
it
this
man
marsouillier
who
had
the
child
perhaps
so
for
curiously
enough
he
was
holding
something
white
a
handkerchief
that
handkerchief
marc
asked
i
picked
it
up
here
just
now
perhaps
the
man
wanted
to
stifle
the
child
cries
with
it
and
dropped
it
as
he
ran
away
but
marc
no
longer
listened
he
was
leaning
over
the
little
form
upon
the
ground
and
an
exclamation
of
frantic
grief
suddenly
escaped
his
lips
our
little
rose
the
victim
was
indeed
the
pretty
little
girl
who
as
a
babe
in
the
arms
of
her
cousin
lucienne
had
offered
a
bouquet
to
simon
on
the
occasion
of
his
triumph
ten
years
previously
she
had
grown
up
full
of
beauty
and
charm
with
a
bright
dimpled
smiling
face
amid
a
mass
of
fair
and
wavy
tresses
and
the
scene
could
be
easily
pictured
the
child
returning
home
across
that
deserted
square
in
the
falling
night
some
bandit
surprising
her
her
and
flinging
her
there
upon
the
ground
whereupon
hearing
a
sound
of
footsteps
he
had
been
seized
with
terror
and
had
fled
the
child
did
not
stir
she
lay
there
as
if
lifeless
in
her
little
white
frock
figured
with
pink
flowerets
a
holiday
frock
which
her
mother
had
allowed
her
to
wear
for
her
visit
to
her
friend
rose
called
marc
who
was
beside
himself
do
you
not
answer
me
my
darling
speak
say
only
one
word
to
me
only
one
word
he
touched
her
gently
not
daring
as
yet
to
raise
her
from
the
ground
and
talking
to
himself
he
said
has
only
fainted
i
can
tell
that
she
is
breathing
but
i
fear
that
something
is
broken
ah
misfortune
dogs
us
here
again
is
grief
indeed
indescribable
terror
came
upon
him
as
all
the
frightful
past
suddenly
arose
before
his
mind
eye
there
under
that
tragic
window
close
to
that
room
where
the
wretched
gorgias
had
killed
little
zéphirin
he
had
now
found
his
own
his
little
rose
who
was
assuredly
hurt
and
who
in
all
probability
only
owed
her
salvation
to
the
accidental
arrival
of
a
stranger
who
was
it
that
had
brought
about
that
awful
renewal
of
the
past
what
new
and
prolonged
anguish
was
foreboded
by
that
crime
as
if
by
the
glow
of
a
great
lightning
flash
marc
at
that
horrible
moment
saw
all
his
past
life
spread
out
and
lived
all
his
battles
and
all
his
sufferings
anew
marsouillier
however
had
remained
there
with
the
handkerchief
in
his
hand
he
ended
by
slipping
it
into
his
pocket
in
an
embarrassed
way
like
a
man
who
had
not
said
all
he
knew
and
who
devoutly
wished
that
he
had
not
crossed
the
square
that
evening
ought
not
to
leave
her
there
monsieur
froment
he
said
at
last
are
not
strong
enough
to
pick
her
up
if
you
like
i
will
take
her
in
my
arms
and
carry
her
to
her
mamma
as
it
is
close
by
marc
was
compelled
to
accept
the
offer
and
followed
the
sturdy
beadle
who
took
the
child
up
very
gently
without
rousing
her
from
her
fainting
fit
in
this
wise
they
reached
the
mother
door
and
for
her
what
a
shock
it
was
when
she
beheld
her
child
now
her
only
joy
and
comfort
brought
back
to
her
insensible
as
pale
as
death
in
her
bright
frock
and
with
her
beautiful
hair
streaming
loosely
about
her
the
frock
was
in
shreds
a
lock
of
hair
which
had
been
torn
off
was
caught
in
the
lace
collar
and
the
struggle
must
have
been
terrible
for
the
child
wrenched
hands
were
all
bruised
and
her
right
arm
hung
down
so
limply
that
it
was
certainly
broken
thérèse
distracted
beside
herself
repeated
amid
her
choking
sobs
my
little
rose
they
have
killed
my
rose
in
vain
did
marc
point
out
to
her
that
the
child
was
still
breathing
and
that
not
a
drop
of
blood
was
to
be
seen
the
mother
still
repeated
that
her
child
was
dead
but
marsouillier
carried
the
girl
upstairs
and
laid
her
on
a
bed
where
all
at
once
she
suddenly
opened
her
eyes
and
gazed
around
her
with
indescribable
terror
then
shivering
the
while
she
began
to
stammer
mamma
mamma
hide
me
i
am
frightened
thunderstruck
by
her
revival
to
consciousness
thérèse
sank
on
the
bed
beside
her
caught
her
in
her
arms
and
pressed
her
to
her
bosom
so
overcome
by
emotion
that
she
could
no
longer
speak
marc
however
begged
the
assistant
teacher
who
happened
to
be
present
to
go
for
a
doctor
and
then
quite
upset
by
the
mystery
endeavoured
to
fathom
it
at
once
happened
to
you
my
darling
he
inquired
you
tell
us
rose
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
as
if
to
make
sure
who
was
speaking
to
her
and
then
with
haggard
wandering
eyes
peered
into
all
the
dim
corners
of
the
room
i
afraid
i
afraid
grandfather
she
said
he
endeavoured
to
reassure
her
and
inquired
gently
nobody
accompany
you
when
you
left
your
little
friend
did
want
anybody
to
come
the
house
is
so
near
and
we
had
played
so
long
i
was
afraid
i
would
get
home
still
later
so
you
came
back
running
my
darling
eh
and
somebody
sprang
on
you
that
is
what
happened
is
it
not
but
the
terrified
child
again
began
to
tremble
and
did
not
answer
marc
had
to
repeat
his
question
yes
somebody
she
stammered
at
last
marc
waited
till
she
became
calmer
caressing
her
hair
the
while
and
kissing
her
on
the
forehead
see
you
ought
to
tell
us
he
resumed
cried
out
naturally
you
struggled
the
man
wanted
to
close
your
mouth
did
he
not
grandfather
it
was
all
so
quick
he
took
hold
of
my
arms
and
he
twisted
them
round
he
wanted
to
drive
me
out
of
my
senses
and
carry
me
off
on
his
back
it
hurt
me
so
dreadfully
i
thought
i
should
die
and
i
fell
to
the
ground
that
is
all
i
remember
marc
felt
greatly
relieved
he
was
now
convinced
that
nothing
worse
had
happened
particularly
as
marsouillier
on
hearing
the
girl
cries
had
hastened
to
the
spot
and
so
he
asked
but
one
question
more
would
you
be
able
to
recognise
the
man
my
dear
again
rose
quivered
and
her
eyes
became
quite
wild
as
if
some
terrible
vision
was
rising
before
her
then
covering
her
face
with
her
hand
she
relapsed
into
stubborn
silence
as
her
glance
had
already
fallen
on
marsouillier
and
she
had
raised
no
exclamation
on
seeing
him
marc
realised
that
he
had
been
mistaken
when
he
had
suspected
the
beadle
of
the
crime
nevertheless
he
wished
to
question
him
also
for
even
allowing
that
he
had
spoken
the
truth
it
might
be
that
he
had
not
told
the
whole
of
it
saw
the
man
run
away
said
marc
you
be
able
to
recognise
him
i
do
think
so
monsieur
froment
he
passed
me
but
it
was
already
dark
besides
i
was
so
disturbed
and
the
beadle
who
had
not
yet
fully
recovered
his
composure
let
a
further
detail
escape
him
said
something
as
he
passed
i
fancy
he
called
imbecile
imbecile
retorted
marc
who
was
greatly
surprised
should
he
have
said
that
to
you
but
marsouillier
deeply
regretting
that
he
had
added
that
particular
for
he
understood
the
possible
gravity
of
any
admission
on
his
part
endeavoured
to
recall
his
words
ca
be
sure
of
anything
he
said
was
like
a
growl
and
no
no
i
should
not
be
able
to
recognise
him
then
as
marc
asked
him
for
the
handkerchief
he
drew
it
from
his
pocket
with
some
appearance
of
and
laid
it
on
a
table
it
was
a
very
common
kind
of
handkerchief
one
of
those
which
are
embroidered
by
the
gross
with
initials
in
red
thread
this
one
was
marked
with
the
letter
f
and
the
clue
was
a
slight
one
for
dozens
of
similar
handkerchiefs
were
sold
in
the
shops
meantime
thérèse
who
had
again
caught
rose
in
a
gentle
embrace
caressed
her
lovingly
doctor
is
coming
my
treasure
she
said
wo
touch
you
any
more
till
he
is
here
it
wo
be
anything
you
are
not
in
great
pain
are
you
mother
rose
replied
my
arm
burns
me
and
seems
very
heavy
then
in
an
undertone
thérèse
in
her
turn
tried
to
confess
the
girl
for
the
mysteriousness
of
the
assault
had
left
her
very
anxious
but
at
each
fresh
question
rose
evinced
yet
greater
alarm
and
at
last
she
closed
her
eyes
and
buried
her
head
in
the
pillow
so
as
to
see
and
hear
nothing
more
every
time
her
mother
made
a
fresh
attempt
begging
her
to
say
if
she
knew
the
man
and
would
be
able
to
recognise
him
the
child
quivered
dreadfully
but
all
at
once
bursting
into
loud
sobs
quite
beside
herself
almost
delirious
she
told
everything
in
a
loud
distressful
voice
fancying
perhaps
that
she
was
simply
whispering
her
words
in
her
mother
ear
mother
mother
i
am
so
grieved
i
recognised
him
it
was
father
who
was
waiting
there
and
who
threw
himself
upon
me
thérèse
sprang
to
her
feet
in
stupefaction
father
what
is
it
you
say
you
unhappy
child
marc
and
marsouillier
also
had
heard
the
girl
and
the
former
drew
near
to
her
with
a
violent
gesture
of
incredulity
father
it
is
impossible
come
come
my
darling
you
must
have
dreamt
that
no
father
was
waiting
for
me
behind
the
school
and
i
recognised
him
by
his
beard
and
his
hat
he
tried
to
carry
me
away
and
as
i
would
not
let
him
he
twisted
my
arms
and
made
me
fall
she
clung
stubbornly
to
that
account
of
the
affair
though
she
could
supply
little
proof
of
what
she
asserted
for
the
man
had
not
spoken
a
word
to
her
and
she
had
only
noticed
his
beard
and
hat
remembering
nothing
else
not
even
his
features
which
had
been
hidden
by
the
darkness
nevertheless
that
man
was
her
father
she
was
sure
of
it
nothing
could
efface
that
impression
which
if
incorrect
might
be
some
haunting
idea
which
had
sprung
from
the
grief
in
which
she
had
seen
her
mother
plunged
since
the
departure
of
the
unfaithful
françois
is
impossible
it
is
madness
marc
repeated
for
his
reason
rebelled
and
protested
against
such
a
notion
françois
had
wished
to
take
rose
away
he
would
not
have
hurt
her
killed
her
almost
thérèse
also
quietly
displayed
a
feeling
of
perfect
certainty
is
incapable
of
such
an
action
said
she
has
caused
me
a
great
deal
of
grief
but
i
know
him
and
will
defend
him
if
need
be
you
were
mistaken
my
poor
rose
nevertheless
the
unhappy
woman
went
to
look
at
the
handkerchief
which
had
remained
on
the
table
and
she
could
not
restrain
a
nervous
start
for
it
appeared
to
be
one
of
a
dozen
marked
with
a
similar
letter
f
which
she
had
purchased
for
her
husband
of
the
sisters
landois
who
kept
a
drapery
shop
in
the
high
street
on
going
to
a
chest
of
drawers
thérèse
found
ten
similar
handkerchiefs
and
it
was
quite
possible
that
françois
had
taken
two
away
with
him
at
the
time
of
his
flight
however
the
unhappy
wife
strove
to
overcome
her
uneasiness
and
as
firmly
and
as
positively
as
before
she
said
handkerchief
may
belong
to
him
but
it
was
not
he
never
shall
i
think
him
guilty
the
strange
scene
seemed
to
have
stupefied
marsouillier
he
had
remained
on
one
side
at
a
loss
apparently
as
to
how
he
might
quit
those
sorrowing
folk
and
since
he
had
heard
the
child
story
his
eyes
had
been
all
astonishment
the
recognition
of
the
handkerchief
brought
his
dismay
to
a
climax
and
at
last
profiting
by
the
arrival
of
the
doctor
fetched
by
the
assistant
teacher
he
managed
to
slip
away
marc
on
his
side
went
into
the
to
await
the
result
of
the
medical
examination
rose
right
arm
was
indeed
broken
but
there
was
nothing
of
a
disquieting
character
about
the
fracture
and
the
wrenched
wrists
and
a
few
bruises
were
the
only
other
marks
of
violence
which
the
doctor
found
he
indeed
was
most
concerned
respecting
the
result
of
the
nervous
shock
which
the
girl
had
experienced
for
it
had
been
a
violent
one
and
he
only
left
her
an
hour
later
when
he
had
reduced
the
fracture
and
saw
her
overcome
as
it
were
plunged
in
a
heavy
sleep
marc
however
had
meantime
sent
a
message
to
his
wife
and
louise
for
he
feared
that
they
might
be
alarmed
by
his
failure
to
return
home
and
they
hastened
to
the
school
terrified
by
this
frightful
business
which
reminded
them
also
of
the
old
and
abominable
affair
thérèse
having
joined
them
a
kind
of
family
council
was
held
the
door
of
the
bedroom
remaining
open
in
order
that
they
might
at
once
hear
the
injured
girl
if
she
should
wake
up
marc
who
was
quite
feverish
expressed
his
views
at
length
what
possible
reason
could
there
have
been
for
françois
to
commit
such
a
deed
he
might
have
yielded
to
a
transport
of
passion
by
running
away
with
colette
but
he
had
invariably
shown
himself
to
be
a
loving
father
and
his
wife
did
not
even
complain
of
his
manner
towards
herself
for
it
had
remained
outwardly
dignified
almost
deferential
thus
what
motive
could
have
prompted
him
if
he
were
guilty
hidden
away
with
his
mistress
in
some
unknown
retreat
it
could
hardly
be
that
he
had
experienced
a
sudden
craving
to
have
his
daughter
with
him
what
could
he
have
done
with
the
child
she
would
have
been
a
burden
on
him
in
the
life
he
must
be
leading
and
even
supposing
that
he
had
wished
to
strike
a
cruel
blow
at
his
wife
and
reduce
her
to
solitude
without
a
consolation
remaining
to
her
it
was
incredible
that
he
should
have
and
injured
his
daughter
have
left
her
upon
the
ground
senseless
he
would
simply
have
taken
her
away
with
him
thus
in
spite
of
statements
in
spite
of
the
handkerchief
françois
could
not
be
guilty
the
impossibilities
were
too
great
nevertheless
faced
as
he
was
by
this
mysterious
problem
and
the
task
of
again
seeking
the
truth
marc
felt
disturbed
and
anxious
for
he
was
convinced
that
marsouillier
would
relate
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
and
that
all
maillebois
would
be
discussing
the
drama
on
the
morrow
and
as
all
the
appearances
were
against
françois
would
public
opinion
denounce
him
even
as
in
former
days
it
had
denounced
his
grandfather
simon
the
jew
in
that
case
how
could
he
be
defended
what
ought
to
be
done
to
prevent
a
renewal
of
the
monstrous
iniquity
of
long
ago
one
thing
that
tends
to
tranquillise
me
said
marc
at
last
that
the
times
have
changed
we
now
have
to
deal
with
people
who
have
been
freed
and
educated
and
it
will
greatly
surprise
me
if
they
do
not
help
us
to
unravel
the
truth
silence
fell
at
last
in
spite
of
the
little
quiver
which
she
was
unable
to
master
thérèse
exclaimed
energetically
are
right
grandfather
before
everything
else
we
must
establish
the
innocence
of
françois
which
i
can
not
possibly
doubt
whatever
may
be
the
accusations
he
has
made
me
suffer
dreadfully
but
i
will
forget
it
and
you
may
rely
on
me
i
will
help
you
with
all
my
strength
geneviève
and
louise
nodded
their
assent
muttered
the
latter
unhappy
lad
when
he
was
seven
years
old
he
used
to
throw
his
arms
round
me
and
say
little
mother
i
love
you
very
dearly
he
has
a
tender
and
passionate
nature
and
thus
one
must
forgive
him
a
great
deal
is
always
some
resource
when
one
has
to
deal
with
loving
natures
remarked
geneviève
in
her
turn
if
they
become
guilty
of
great
transgressions
love
helps
them
to
repair
them
on
the
morrow
even
as
marc
had
foreseen
all
maillebois
was
in
a
hubbub
people
talked
of
nothing
but
that
assault
of
the
charge
which
the
injured
girl
had
brought
against
her
own
father
of
the
handkerchief
picked
up
by
a
passer
and
recognised
by
the
wife
marsouillier
told
the
story
to
all
who
were
willing
to
listen
to
him
and
he
even
embellished
it
somewhat
making
out
that
he
had
seen
and
done
everything
in
connection
with
the
rescue
he
was
not
a
malicious
man
he
was
simply
vain
and
inclined
to
poltroonery
in
such
wise
that
while
it
flattered
his
feelings
to
become
a
personage
he
remained
secretly
apprehensive
of
great
personal
worries
if
the
affair
should
turn
out
badly
he
was
as
already
mentioned
a
nephew
of
the
pious
philis
and
he
lived
on
his
pay
as
a
beadle
which
pay
was
extremely
small
now
that
only
a
few
believers
provided
for
the
expenses
at
martin
and
it
was
said
that
he
himself
was
not
a
believer
at
all
that
his
views
were
really
very
free
ones
and
that
if
he
thus
ate
the
bread
of
hypocrisy
it
was
simply
because
he
was
unable
to
earn
any
other
however
that
might
be
the
few
remaining
worshippers
who
paid
his
salary
the
last
catholics
of
the
district
who
were
enraged
by
their
defeat
and
the
abandonment
into
which
the
church
was
sinking
at
once
seized
upon
his
adventure
and
resolved
to
exploit
that
scandal
which
had
assuredly
been
vouchsafed
to
them
by
heaven
never
had
they
dared
to
hope
for
such
an
opportunity
to
resume
hostilities
and
they
must
profit
by
the
divine
favour
to
make
a
supreme
effort
thus
black
skirts
were
again
seen
gliding
along
the
streets
of
maillebois
old
ladies
were
again
heard
telling
the
most
extraordinary
stories
some
unknown
person
had
related
that
she
had
seen
françois
on
the
night
of
the
crime
in
the
company
of
two
masked
men
who
were
freemasons
undoubtedly
and
as
everybody
knew
that
the
freemasons
needed
the
blood
of
a
young
girl
for
their
black
mass
it
followed
that
françois
after
some
drawing
of
lots
had
been
chosen
to
provide
the
blood
of
his
daughter
did
that
not
explain
everything
the
sectarian
savage
violence
his
unnatural
ferocity
but
it
happened
that
the
inventors
of
that
idiotic
fable
could
not
find
a
single
newspaper
to
print
it
and
thus
they
had
to
spread
it
by
word
of
mouth
among
the
poorer
folk
when
evening
came
it
had
already
gone
all
round
the
town
and
had
even
reached
jonville
le
moreux
and
other
neighbouring
villages
and
the
seed
of
falsehood
being
sown
the
plotters
only
had
to
wait
for
the
poisonous
crop
which
they
hoped
to
see
arise
from
the
popular
ignorance
but
as
marc
had
said
the
times
had
changed
on
all
sides
people
shrugged
their
shoulders
when
they
heard
that
foolish
story
such
inventions
had
been
all
very
well
in
former
times
when
men
were
children
and
fell
eagerly
on
improbabilities
but
nowadays
people
knew
too
much
and
a
story
of
that
kind
was
not
accepted
without
due
examination
in
the
first
place
it
was
immediately
ascertained
that
françois
did
not
happen
to
be
a
freemason
moreover
nobody
had
seen
him
in
the
town
and
it
seemed
certain
that
he
was
hidden
away
at
a
distance
with
that
girl
colette
who
had
disappeared
from
maillebois
at
the
same
time
as
himself
again
there
were
all
sorts
of
reasons
for
thinking
him
innocent
indeed
the
whole
district
pronounced
the
same
opinion
on
him
as
his
relatives
had
done
he
was
a
man
of
an
amorous
nature
who
might
yield
to
a
passionate
transport
but
he
was
also
a
loving
father
and
as
such
incapable
of
his
own
child
excellent
testimony
came
in
from
all
sides
his
pupils
and
their
parents
praised
his
gentleness
several
neighbours
related
that
in
spite
of
his
errors
he
had
remained
affectionately
attached
to
his
wife
nevertheless
people
were
confronted
by
the
accusations
of
rose
the
disquieting
clue
of
the
handkerchief
the
scene
repeatedly
recounted
by
marsouillier
the
whole
constituting
an
irritating
mystery
a
distressing
problem
for
all
who
were
competent
to
weigh
and
judge
facts
if
indeed
françois
were
not
guilty
however
much
appearances
might
be
against
him
somebody
else
must
be
the
culprit
and
who
could
that
be
and
how
was
he
to
be
discovered
then
while
the
judicial
authorities
were
inquiring
into
the
matter
something
quite
new
was
seen
mere
ordinary
townsfolk
came
forward
quite
voluntarily
to
relate
whatever
they
knew
whatever
they
had
witnessed
felt
or
surmised
now
that
men
minds
were
cultivated
there
was
a
general
desire
for
justice
a
dread
of
any
possible
error
a
bongard
came
to
say
that
on
the
evening
of
the
assault
while
he
was
passing
the
town
hall
he
had
seen
a
man
who
looked
somewhat
scared
and
who
seemed
to
have
run
up
from
the
direction
of
the
place
des
capucins
and
that
man
was
not
françois
then
a
doloir
brought
a
smoker
which
he
had
found
between
two
behind
the
schools
and
he
pointed
out
that
this
box
might
have
fallen
from
the
culprit
pocket
and
that
françois
did
not
smoke
a
savin
also
recounted
that
he
had
overheard
a
conversation
between
two
old
ladies
from
which
he
had
drawn
the
conclusion
that
the
culprit
was
to
be
sought
among
the
acquaintances
of
marsouillier
the
latter
having
let
his
tongue
wag
while
he
was
in
the
company
of
certain
friendly
devotees
but
the
most
intelligent
and
active
helpers
were
the
sisters
landois
who
kept
the
drapery
shop
in
the
high
street
they
had
been
pupils
of
mademoiselle
mazeline
and
indeed
all
the
workers
in
the
cause
of
truth
all
the
voluntary
witnesses
had
passed
through
the
hands
of
the
secular
teachers
marc
joulic
or
joseph
as
for
the
sisters
landois
it
had
occurred
to
them
to
consult
their
books
to
ascertain
the
names
of
the
persons
to
whom
they
had
sold
handkerchiefs
similar
to
the
one
which
the
culprit
had
wished
to
employ
as
a
gag
they
readily
found
françois
name
and
below
it
two
days
later
they
perceived
that
of
faustin
roudille
the
brother
of
the
young
woman
colette
with
whom
françois
had
fled
that
was
the
first
clue
the
first
gleam
of
the
light
which
was
to
spread
and
become
decisive
as
it
happened
this
man
faustin
had
been
without
a
situation
for
the
last
fortnight
after
coming
to
an
agreement
with
the
surrounding
localities
the
town
of
maillebois
had
at
last
purchased
the
magnificent
estate
of
la
désirade
which
it
intended
to
transform
into
a
people
palace
a
convalescent
home
a
public
park
open
to
all
the
workers
of
the
region
instead
of
some
congregation
of
black
frocks
being
installed
in
that
delightful
spot
under
that
royal
verdure
among
those
plashing
waters
and
those
gleaming
marbles
swains
and
their
lassies
young
mothers
and
their
babes
old
folk
desirous
of
repose
would
flock
thither
to
enjoy
the
sweetness
and
splendour
of
the
scene
thus
faustin
the
a
creature
of
the
last
remaining
clericalists
had
quitted
the
estate
and
was
to
be
seen
prowling
about
maillebois
showing
himself
very
bitter
and
aggressive
especially
with
respect
to
his
sister
colette
whose
escapade
said
he
had
dishonoured
him
people
were
somewhat
surprised
by
this
sudden
severity
on
his
part
for
nobody
was
ignorant
of
the
good
understanding
which
had
previously
reigned
between
the
brother
and
the
sister
and
the
frequency
with
which
the
former
had
borrowed
money
from
the
young
woman
when
he
knew
her
to
be
in
funds
had
there
been
a
rupture
then
was
faustin
exasperated
with
colette
because
she
had
taken
herself
off
just
as
he
lost
his
situation
or
was
he
playing
some
comedy
still
remaining
in
agreement
with
his
sister
acquainted
with
her
and
secretly
working
on
her
behalf
these
points
remained
obscure
but
the
discovery
made
by
the
sisters
landois
directed
general
attention
to
faustin
his
actions
and
his
words
a
week
then
sufficed
for
the
inquiry
to
make
considerable
progress
first
of
all
bongard
evidence
was
confirmed
several
people
now
remembered
that
on
the
evening
of
the
assault
they
had
met
faustin
in
the
high
street
looking
agitated
and
turning
round
as
if
he
wished
to
ascertain
what
might
be
taking
place
in
the
direction
of
the
schools
and
it
was
certainly
he
whom
they
had
seen
they
had
positively
recognised
him
then
too
the
found
by
doloir
seemed
to
belong
to
him
at
least
folk
asserted
that
they
had
seen
a
similar
one
in
his
hands
finally
the
conversation
which
savin
had
overheard
and
the
hypothesis
of
an
acquaintance
between
marsouillier
and
the
culprit
received
striking
confirmation
for
the
beadle
and
the
of
la
désirade
had
been
quite
intimate
that
seemed
to
be
the
decisive
fact
the
clue
which
would
lead
to
full
enlightenment
as
marc
who
was
following
the
inquiry
with
impassioned
attention
immediately
understood
thus
he
took
it
upon
himself
to
extract
a
confession
from
marsouillier
he
recalled
the
beadle
strange
manner
when
he
had
found
him
near
rose
after
the
culprit
flight
he
remembered
that
he
had
seemed
embarrassed
and
anxious
disturbed
at
having
to
give
up
the
handkerchief
and
he
particularly
recalled
his
stupefaction
when
rose
had
accused
her
father
and
thérèse
had
produced
some
similar
handkerchiefs
from
her
chest
of
drawers
and
he
was
greatly
struck
by
that
word
which
the
culprit
had
cast
in
the
face
and
which
the
latter
in
his
perturbation
had
repeated
it
was
a
significant
word
it
was
like
a
reproach
hurled
by
a
man
at
a
blundering
friend
whose
inopportune
arrival
on
the
scene
had
spoilt
everything
thus
marc
called
upon
marsouillier
know
my
man
he
said
to
him
gravest
charges
are
being
accumulated
against
faustin
he
will
certainly
be
arrested
this
evening
are
you
not
afraid
of
being
compromised
silent
with
hanging
head
the
beadle
listened
to
an
enumeration
of
the
proofs
own
that
you
recognised
him
marc
added
how
could
i
have
recognised
him
monsieur
froment
said
marsouillier
has
no
beard
and
he
wears
a
cap
whereas
the
man
i
saw
had
a
full
beard
and
a
felt
hat
those
were
points
which
rose
herself
confirmed
and
which
as
yet
remained
unelucidated
he
might
have
got
a
hat
somewhere
and
have
put
on
a
false
beard
marc
suggested
in
any
case
he
spoke
you
yourself
told
me
so
surely
you
must
have
recognised
his
voice
when
he
called
you
an
imbecile
marsouillier
was
already
raising
his
hand
to
contradict
himself
and
swear
that
the
man
had
not
pronounced
a
single
word
but
marc
bright
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
and
as
he
met
their
gaze
his
strength
failed
him
and
then
man
as
he
was
at
bottom
he
grew
disturbed
no
longer
having
the
courage
to
do
a
bad
action
in
some
stupid
spirit
of
vanity
i
have
inquired
into
your
connection
with
faustin
marc
resumed
know
that
you
and
he
often
met
and
that
he
readily
cast
that
expression
imbecile
in
your
face
when
he
found
you
more
scrupulous
than
he
liked
true
marsouillier
admitted
called
me
an
imbecile
and
it
ended
by
being
hardly
pleasant
then
on
being
pressed
exhorted
to
relieve
his
conscience
in
his
own
interest
for
the
authorities
might
believe
him
to
be
an
accomplice
he
ended
by
yielding
to
his
fears
as
much
as
to
his
respect
for
truth
yes
monsieur
froment
i
did
recognise
him
only
he
could
have
called
me
an
imbecile
in
that
voice
i
ca
be
mistaken
he
has
given
me
that
name
too
many
times
and
he
must
merely
have
worn
a
false
beard
as
you
surmise
and
have
pulled
it
off
as
he
ran
away
for
when
some
people
saw
him
at
the
corner
of
the
high
street
he
was
wearing
a
hat
but
he
was
shaven
as
usual
with
no
beard
at
all
marc
felt
delighted
for
this
testimony
would
certainly
prove
decisive
shaking
hands
with
marsouillier
he
said
to
him
i
knew
it
very
well
you
are
a
good
fellow
good
fellow
no
doubt
you
see
monsieur
froment
i
am
an
old
pupil
of
monsieur
joulic
and
when
a
master
has
taught
one
to
love
truth
it
never
goes
away
one
may
wish
to
tell
a
falsehood
but
the
whole
of
one
being
rises
up
in
protest
besides
when
one
knows
how
to
use
one
reason
a
little
it
becomes
impossible
to
credit
the
foolish
things
which
are
put
into
circulation
i
was
very
worried
at
heart
about
this
unhappy
affair
but
then
i
a
very
poor
man
i
have
only
my
post
as
beadle
as
a
means
of
livelihood
and
my
position
compelled
me
to
say
the
same
as
the
old
friends
of
my
uncle
philis
then
marsouillier
paused
and
with
a
gesture
of
despair
big
tears
gathering
the
while
in
his
eyes
he
added
i
done
for
now
i
shall
be
turned
out
of
doors
and
left
to
starve
in
the
streets
but
marc
reassured
him
by
a
positive
promise
to
find
him
some
employment
and
then
he
hastened
away
eager
as
he
was
to
acquaint
thérèse
with
the
result
of
the
interview
that
conclusive
testimony
by
which
françois
was
completely
cleared
for
a
fortnight
past
thérèse
had
remained
nursing
rose
still
feeling
firmly
convinced
of
her
husband
innocence
but
intensely
hurt
at
receiving
no
news
of
him
in
spite
of
the
stir
occasioned
by
the
affair
which
all
the
newspapers
had
recounted
and
since
her
daughter
had
been
recovering
already
able
to
get
up
her
arm
healing
in
a
satisfactory
manner
thérèse
mastered
by
increasing
sorrow
had
remained
mute
quite
overcome
in
her
deserted
home
but
that
very
evening
while
marc
was
gaily
completing
his
account
of
his
conversation
with
marsouillier
she
experienced
a
great
shock
for
françois
suddenly
entered
the
room
and
the
scene
was
a
poignant
one
however
simple
might
be
the
words
that
were
exchanged
did
not
think
me
guilty
thérèse
françois
i
assure
you
morning
in
the
sad
solitude
in
which
i
found
myself
i
was
still
ignorant
of
everything
but
i
happened
to
glance
at
an
old
newspaper
and
then
i
hastened
here
how
is
rose
is
much
better
she
is
there
in
the
bedroom
françois
had
not
dared
to
kiss
his
wife
she
stood
before
him
erect
and
severe
amid
her
emotion
but
marc
who
had
risen
caught
hold
of
his
grandson
hands
guessing
by
his
pallor
his
ravaged
face
which
still
bore
traces
of
his
tears
that
he
had
been
involved
in
some
tragic
drama
tell
me
everything
my
poor
lad
then
françois
in
a
few
quivering
words
and
with
all
sincerity
recounted
his
folly
his
sudden
flight
from
maillebois
on
the
arm
of
that
colette
who
had
maddened
him
their
life
of
seclusion
in
a
lonely
district
of
beaumont
where
they
had
scarcely
quitted
their
room
a
fortnight
cloistered
life
interspersed
with
furious
storms
extravagant
caprices
on
the
part
of
that
passionate
gipsy
reproaches
tears
and
even
blows
then
all
at
once
her
flight
nobody
knew
whither
after
a
last
scene
when
she
had
flung
the
furniture
at
her
lover
head
that
had
happened
three
weeks
previously
and
at
first
he
had
awaited
her
return
then
buried
himself
as
it
were
in
the
seclusion
of
that
lonely
room
full
of
despair
and
remorse
no
longer
knowing
how
to
return
to
maillebois
to
his
wife
whom
he
declared
he
had
never
ceased
to
love
in
spite
of
all
his
folly
while
he
spoke
thérèse
who
was
still
standing
there
had
turned
her
head
aside
and
when
he
had
finished
she
said
is
no
occasion
for
me
to
know
those
things
i
merely
understand
that
you
have
come
back
to
answer
the
charges
brought
against
you
marc
gently
observed
charges
have
now
ceased
to
exist
have
come
back
to
see
rose
françois
on
his
side
declared
i
repeat
that
i
would
have
been
here
the
very
next
day
if
i
had
not
remained
ignorant
of
everything
good
thérèse
rejoined
do
not
prevent
you
from
seeing
your
daughter
she
is
there
you
may
go
in
there
ensued
a
very
singular
scene
which
marc
watched
with
impassioned
interest
rose
was
seated
in
an
armchair
reading
her
injured
arm
hanging
in
a
sling
as
the
door
opened
she
looked
up
and
raised
a
quivering
cry
instinct
it
seemed
both
with
fear
and
with
joy
papa
then
she
rose
and
all
at
once
seemed
stupefied
it
was
you
papa
was
it
the
other
evening
she
cried
man
was
shorter
and
his
beard
was
different
and
she
continued
to
scrutinise
her
father
as
if
she
found
him
otherwise
than
she
had
pictured
him
since
his
flight
since
she
had
watched
her
forsaken
mother
weeping
had
she
pictured
him
as
a
wicked
man
then
squat
of
build
and
with
an
ogre
face
she
now
recognised
the
father
with
the
pleasant
smile
whom
she
adored
and
if
he
had
come
back
it
was
surely
in
order
that
no
more
tears
might
be
shed
in
their
dear
home
but
all
at
once
she
began
to
tremble
at
the
thought
of
the
dreadful
consequences
of
her
error
to
think
i
accused
you
papa
that
i
kept
on
saying
that
the
man
was
you
no
no
it
was
you
i
told
a
story
i
will
explain
it
to
the
gendarmes
if
they
come
to
take
you
she
sank
back
in
the
weeping
bitterly
and
her
father
had
to
take
her
on
his
lap
kiss
her
and
vow
to
her
that
their
sorrows
were
all
over
he
himself
stammered
with
emotion
as
he
spoke
had
he
behaved
so
vilely
then
that
he
had
appeared
a
very
monster
in
the
eyes
of
his
daughter
and
that
she
had
thought
him
capable
of
her
so
dreadfully
thérèse
meantime
while
listening
had
striven
to
remain
impassive
saying
never
a
word
françois
glanced
at
her
anxiously
as
if
to
ascertain
whether
she
would
again
tolerate
his
presence
in
that
home
which
he
had
ravaged
and
marc
noticing
the
severity
of
her
demeanour
her
unwillingness
to
forgive
preferred
to
take
his
grandson
away
with
him
and
provide
him
with
a
lodging
pending
the
advent
of
a
calmer
hour
that
very
evening
the
officers
of
the
law
presented
themselves
at
faustin
dwelling
but
they
did
not
find
the
rascal
there
the
place
was
closed
the
man
had
fled
and
the
search
for
him
failed
he
was
never
taken
people
ended
by
believing
that
he
had
escaped
to
america
his
sister
colette
had
perhaps
accompanied
him
thither
for
although
she
was
sought
she
was
never
seen
again
either
at
maillebois
or
at
beaumont
and
the
whole
affair
remained
very
obscure
one
was
reduced
to
conjectures
had
the
brother
and
sister
been
accomplices
had
colette
in
some
plot
when
she
had
induced
françois
to
carry
her
off
or
had
faustin
merely
wished
to
avail
himself
in
some
mysterious
manner
of
the
situation
which
the
elopement
had
created
but
the
chief
point
of
all
was
whether
there
had
been
some
superior
behind
him
some
man
of
intelligence
and
will
who
had
planned
and
prepared
everything
in
view
of
a
supreme
assault
on
the
new
order
of
things
by
renewing
as
it
were
the
old
simon
affair
all
those
suppositions
were
allowable
given
the
facts
and
in
the
end
nobody
doubted
that
there
had
really
been
some
mysterious
agreement
and
ambush
thus
how
great
was
marc
relief
when
the
authorities
being
convinced
of
faustin
guilt
and
flight
set
the
affair
aside
at
the
first
moment
that
renewal
of
the
old
abominations
that
last
supreme
attempt
to
besmirch
the
secular
schools
had
greatly
disquieted
marc
but
he
was
astonished
at
the
rapidity
with
which
the
truth
had
been
made
manifest
by
public
good
sense
the
appearances
against
françois
had
been
far
greater
than
those
against
simon
in
the
old
days
his
own
daughter
had
accused
him
and
even
if
she
had
retracted
her
words
it
would
simply
have
been
said
that
she
had
yielded
to
family
pressure
in
former
times
no
witnesses
neither
a
bongard
nor
a
doloir
nor
a
savin
would
have
dared
to
come
forward
and
say
what
they
had
heard
or
seen
for
fear
of
compromising
themselves
in
former
times
marsouillier
would
not
have
relieved
his
conscience
firstly
because
he
would
have
felt
no
need
of
doing
so
and
secondly
because
a
powerful
faction
would
have
immediately
risen
to
support
and
glorify
his
original
falsehood
the
congregations
had
then
been
ready
at
hand
poisoning
everything
making
a
dogma
a
cult
of
error
rome
in
her
battle
against
free
thought
had
made
a
savage
use
of
political
parties
maddening
them
hurling
them
one
upon
the
other
in
the
hope
of
some
civil
war
which
by
cutting
the
nation
in
halves
might
render
her
mistress
of
the
majority
the
poor
and
ignorant
and
now
that
rome
was
vanquished
that
the
congregations
were
disappearing
that
not
a
jesuit
would
soon
be
left
to
obscure
men
thoughts
and
pervert
their
actions
human
reason
was
working
freely
the
explanation
of
all
the
good
sense
and
logic
which
marc
had
lately
observed
was
not
to
be
sought
elsewhere
the
simple
fact
was
that
the
people
being
now
educated
and
freed
from
the
errors
of
centuries
were
becoming
capable
of
truth
and
justice
but
amid
the
delight
of
victory
some
anxiety
lingered
in
heart
anxiety
at
the
rupture
which
had
occurred
between
françois
and
thérèse
that
question
of
the
happiness
of
man
and
woman
which
happiness
can
only
spring
from
their
perfect
agreement
marc
did
not
entertain
any
wild
hope
of
being
able
to
kill
the
passions
and
prevent
our
poor
humanity
from
bleeding
beneath
the
spur
of
desire
there
would
always
be
broken
hearts
tortured
and
jealous
flesh
only
might
one
not
hope
that
woman
being
freed
and
raised
to
equality
with
man
would
render
the
sexual
struggle
less
bitter
impart
to
it
some
calm
dignity
already
during
the
recent
scandal
women
had
shown
themselves
the
friends
of
truth
employing
all
their
energy
to
discover
it
they
were
emancipated
from
the
church
they
were
no
longer
possessed
by
base
superstition
and
the
fear
of
hell
they
no
longer
feigned
a
false
humility
before
the
priests
they
were
no
longer
the
servants
who
prostrated
themselves
before
men
the
sex
which
seems
to
acknowledge
its
abjection
and
which
revenges
itself
for
its
enforced
humility
by
rotting
and
disorganising
everything
they
had
ceased
to
act
as
snares
of
voluptuousness
in
accordance
with
the
discreet
advice
of
their
confessors
seeking
to
entrap
men
in
order
to
promote
the
triumph
of
religion
they
had
become
normal
wives
and
mothers
since
they
had
been
wrested
from
that
morbid
falsehood
of
the
divine
spouse
which
had
unhinged
so
many
poor
minds
and
now
was
it
not
their
duty
to
complete
the
great
work
by
exercising
the
rights
they
had
regained
with
great
wisdom
and
kindness
at
last
it
occurred
to
marc
to
assemble
the
whole
family
at
the
school
in
that
large
classroom
where
he
himself
had
taught
and
where
joseph
and
françois
had
taught
after
him
and
there
was
a
certain
solemnity
about
that
meeting
held
one
afternoon
at
the
close
of
september
amid
the
sunshine
which
cast
gentle
beams
on
the
master
desk
the
boys
forms
the
blackboards
and
the
pictures
hanging
from
the
walls
sébastien
and
sarah
came
from
beaumont
clément
and
charlotte
arrived
with
their
daughter
lucienne
from
jonville
and
joseph
warned
some
days
previously
had
returned
from
a
holiday
tour
feeling
very
much
affected
by
all
that
had
occurred
in
his
absence
finally
marc
himself
and
geneviève
accompanied
by
louise
and
joseph
repaired
to
the
rendezvous
taking
françois
with
them
thérèse
and
rose
awaiting
their
arrival
in
the
classroom
altogether
twelve
members
of
the
family
attended
the
gathering
and
at
first
deep
silence
prevailed
dear
thérèse
said
marc
at
last
have
no
wish
to
do
violence
to
your
feelings
we
have
only
come
here
for
a
family
chat
you
have
no
doubt
suffered
in
your
heart
but
you
have
never
known
such
a
great
rending
as
when
husband
and
wife
have
seemed
to
come
from
two
different
worlds
and
have
suddenly
found
themselves
parted
by
such
an
abyss
as
to
suggest
no
likelihood
of
ever
being
united
again
in
former
times
woman
in
the
hands
of
the
church
had
become
an
instrument
of
torture
for
man
who
was
already
freed
ah
how
many
tears
were
shed
in
those
days
how
many
homes
were
broken
up
silence
fell
again
then
geneviève
who
was
deeply
moved
in
her
turn
said
my
dear
marc
i
often
regarded
you
wrongly
i
often
tortured
you
in
the
old
days
and
you
do
right
to
recall
those
evil
years
your
words
can
not
wound
me
now
since
i
have
had
strength
enough
to
overcome
the
poison
but
how
many
women
remained
agonising
in
the
old
dungeon
how
many
homes
perished
in
grief
i
myself
have
never
been
entirely
cured
i
have
always
trembled
with
the
dread
of
being
mastered
once
more
by
long
heredity
and
the
perverting
influence
of
early
education
and
if
i
have
managed
to
remain
erect
it
is
thanks
to
you
your
sturdy
good
sense
and
active
affection
for
all
which
i
thank
you
my
good
marc
happy
tears
had
come
into
her
eyes
and
she
continued
with
increasing
emotion
my
poor
grandmother
my
poor
mother
yes
they
were
to
be
pitied
they
were
so
wretched
assailed
by
destructive
ferments
cast
out
of
their
sex
as
it
were
by
their
voluntary
martyrdom
my
poor
grandmother
was
a
terrible
woman
but
then
she
had
never
known
a
joy
in
life
she
lived
in
perpetual
nothingness
and
thus
why
should
she
not
have
dreamt
of
reducing
others
to
the
same
painful
renunciation
of
everything
which
she
had
imposed
upon
herself
and
my
poor
mother
too
what
a
long
agony
did
she
undergo
from
having
tasted
the
delight
of
being
loved
and
afterwards
from
having
lapsed
for
ever
into
that
religion
of
falsehood
and
death
which
denies
all
the
powers
and
joys
of
life
while
geneviève
spoke
two
shadowy
forms
seemed
to
flit
by
the
vanished
forms
of
madame
duparque
and
madame
berthereau
those
pitiable
disquieting
devotees
of
another
age
one
of
whom
had
belonged
entirely
to
the
ferocious
exterminating
church
while
the
other
of
a
gentler
nature
had
died
in
despair
at
the
thought
that
she
had
never
attempted
to
sever
her
chain
geneviève
eyes
seemed
to
wander
away
after
them
both
she
herself
had
known
the
great
battle
for
it
had
been
waged
around
her
and
within
her
and
it
was
happiness
for
her
to
think
that
she
had
one
day
felt
free
again
and
had
returned
to
life
and
to
health
but
her
eyes
at
last
fell
upon
her
daughter
louise
who
smiled
at
her
very
lovingly
and
then
leant
forward
to
kiss
her
said
louise
were
the
bravest
and
the
most
deserving
for
it
was
you
who
fought
and
suffered
it
is
to
you
we
owe
the
victory
paid
for
with
so
many
tears
i
remember
coming
as
i
did
after
you
it
was
no
great
merit
for
me
to
free
myself
from
the
past
and
if
never
a
quiver
of
error
disturbed
me
it
was
because
i
profited
by
the
terrible
lesson
which
at
one
time
made
all
our
hearts
bleed
in
our
poor
mourning
home
quiet
you
flatterer
replied
geneviève
laughing
and
returning
her
kiss
were
the
child
who
saved
us
whose
strong
and
skilful
little
mind
intervened
so
lovingly
and
triumphed
over
every
obstacle
we
owe
our
peace
to
you
you
were
the
first
free
little
woman
with
enough
intelligence
will
and
resolution
to
set
happiness
on
earth
then
marc
turning
towards
thérèse
explained
were
not
born
my
dear
at
the
time
of
all
those
things
and
you
are
ignorant
of
them
having
come
after
louise
having
never
had
anything
to
do
with
baptism
or
confession
or
communion
you
find
it
easy
and
simple
to
live
freely
beyond
the
pale
of
religious
imposture
and
social
prejudice
with
no
other
bonds
about
you
than
those
of
your
own
reason
and
conscience
but
for
things
to
be
as
they
are
mothers
and
grandmothers
passed
through
frightful
crises
the
worst
follies
the
worst
torments
as
is
the
case
with
all
the
social
questions
the
one
solution
lay
in
education
it
was
necessary
to
impart
knowledge
to
woman
before
setting
her
in
her
legitimate
place
as
the
equal
and
companion
of
man
that
was
the
first
thing
necessary
the
essential
condition
of
human
happiness
for
woman
could
only
free
man
after
being
freed
herself
as
long
as
she
remained
the
priest
servant
and
accomplice
an
instrument
of
reaction
espionage
and
warfare
in
the
home
man
himself
remained
in
chains
incapable
of
all
virile
and
decisive
action
the
strength
of
the
future
will
lie
in
the
absolute
agreement
of
man
and
wife
and
so
my
dear
you
see
how
sad
it
makes
us
that
misfortune
should
again
have
come
into
your
home
there
is
no
abyss
created
by
different
beliefs
between
you
and
françois
you
are
of
the
same
spheres
the
same
education
he
is
not
your
master
by
law
and
custom
as
he
would
have
been
in
the
old
days
you
are
not
his
servant
seeking
an
opportunity
to
revenge
yourself
on
him
for
his
mastery
you
have
the
same
rights
as
he
has
you
can
dispose
of
your
life
as
you
choose
your
joint
peace
and
agreement
are
based
solely
on
reason
logic
and
the
dictates
of
life
itself
which
to
be
lived
in
health
and
all
fulness
requires
the
mating
of
man
and
woman
but
alas
we
see
your
peace
destroyed
by
the
eternal
fragility
of
human
nature
unless
indeed
kindness
of
heart
should
help
you
to
win
it
back
thérèse
had
listened
calm
dignified
and
with
an
expression
of
great
deference
know
all
those
things
grandfather
you
must
not
think
i
have
forgotten
them
said
she
why
has
françois
been
living
with
you
for
some
days
past
he
might
have
remained
here
there
are
two
lodgings
the
schoolmaster
and
the
schoolmistress
and
i
do
not
prevent
him
from
taking
possession
of
the
former
while
i
occupy
the
other
in
that
fashion
he
can
resume
his
duties
when
the
boys
come
back
in
a
few
days
time
we
are
free
as
you
say
and
i
desire
to
remain
free
her
father
and
her
mother
sébastien
and
sarah
then
tried
to
intervene
affectionately
and
geneviève
louise
and
charlotte
indeed
all
the
women
present
smiled
at
her
entreated
her
with
their
glances
but
she
would
listen
to
nothing
she
rejected
their
suggestions
resolutely
though
without
any
anger
has
wounded
me
cruelly
she
said
thought
i
had
quite
ceased
to
love
him
and
i
should
be
telling
you
a
falsehood
if
i
said
that
i
am
now
certain
i
love
him
still
you
can
not
wish
me
to
tell
an
untruth
you
can
not
wish
me
to
resume
life
in
common
with
him
when
it
would
be
cowardice
and
shame
at
this
a
cry
escaped
françois
who
hitherto
had
remained
silent
and
visibly
anxious
i
thérèse
i
still
love
you
he
exclaimed
love
you
as
i
never
loved
you
before
and
if
you
have
suffered
i
think
that
i
now
suffer
even
more
than
you
have
done
she
turned
towards
him
and
said
very
gently
you
speak
the
truth
i
am
willing
to
believe
it
it
is
quite
possible
that
you
still
love
in
spite
of
your
folly
for
amid
all
our
craving
for
reason
our
poor
human
hearts
will
ever
remain
a
source
of
dementia
and
as
you
suffer
so
much
there
are
two
of
us
who
suffer
dreadfully
but
i
can
not
be
your
wife
again
if
i
no
longer
love
you
if
i
no
longer
wish
you
for
my
husband
it
would
be
unworthy
of
us
both
our
ill
in
lieu
of
healing
would
be
poisoned
by
it
the
best
course
for
us
to
follow
is
to
live
as
good
neighbours
good
friends
and
attending
to
our
work
each
free
once
more
i
mamma
cried
rose
whose
eyes
were
full
of
tears
my
darling
you
will
love
us
both
as
you
loved
us
yesterday
and
do
be
anxious
these
are
questions
which
one
only
understands
when
one
is
older
than
you
are
with
a
caressing
gesture
marc
summoned
the
girl
to
him
and
having
seated
her
on
his
knees
he
was
about
to
plead
the
cause
of
françois
once
more
when
thérèse
hastily
forestalled
him
no
grandfather
do
not
insist
i
beg
you
it
is
your
tender
heart
not
your
reason
that
now
wishes
to
speak
if
you
prevailed
over
me
you
might
have
cause
to
repent
it
let
me
be
wise
and
strong
i
know
very
well
that
you
wish
to
spare
us
suffering
ah
let
us
confess
that
suffering
will
be
eternal
it
is
in
us
no
doubt
for
one
of
the
unknown
purposes
of
life
our
poor
hearts
will
always
bleed
we
shall
always
rend
them
in
hours
of
exasperated
passion
in
spite
of
all
the
health
and
all
the
good
sense
that
we
may
succeed
in
acquiring
and
perhaps
that
is
the
necessary
good
for
happiness
a
slight
chilling
quiver
seemed
to
dim
the
bright
sunlight
through
all
there
passed
a
consciousness
of
the
sorrowful
grandeur
of
that
recognition
of
suffering
what
does
it
matter
thérèse
continued
no
fears
grandfather
we
will
be
worthy
and
brave
it
is
nothing
to
suffer
it
is
only
necessary
that
suffering
should
not
make
us
blind
and
wicked
nobody
will
know
that
we
suffer
and
we
will
even
try
to
be
the
better
for
it
more
gentle
to
others
more
desirous
of
assuaging
the
causes
of
grief
which
exist
in
the
world
and
besides
grandfather
do
not
regret
anything
say
to
yourself
that
you
have
done
all
you
possibly
could
do
that
you
have
carried
out
an
admirable
task
which
will
give
us
all
the
happiness
that
reason
can
yield
as
for
the
rest
as
for
sentimental
life
each
with
his
or
her
love
will
settle
that
according
to
personal
circumstances
even
if
it
be
in
tears
leave
us
françois
and
me
leave
us
to
live
and
suffer
even
as
we
choose
for
it
only
concerns
ourselves
it
is
sufficient
that
you
should
have
freed
our
minds
and
made
us
conscious
of
a
world
of
truth
and
justice
and
as
you
have
brought
us
together
here
grandfather
it
shall
not
be
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
a
rupture
of
which
only
françois
and
myself
can
be
the
judges
but
it
shall
be
to
give
us
an
opportunity
to
acclaim
you
to
express
to
you
our
adoration
and
our
gratitude
for
your
work
at
this
they
all
clapped
hands
transported
with
delight
and
the
splendour
of
the
sun
seemed
to
have
returned
and
to
stream
in
a
sheet
of
gold
through
the
lofty
windows
yes
yes
this
was
the
triumph
in
that
very
classroom
where
he
had
fought
so
bravely
where
he
had
given
the
best
of
his
heart
and
his
mind
to
those
who
would
become
the
people
of
the
morrow
children
grandchildren
all
were
his
pupils
and
all
surrounded
him
as
if
he
were
a
very
venerable
and
powerful
patriarch
from
whom
the
happy
future
had
sprung
he
had
kept
rose
who
represented
the
last
generation
in
its
flower
on
his
lap
and
she
had
twined
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
was
covering
his
face
with
kisses
his
daughter
louise
his
son
clément
had
set
themselves
beside
him
with
joseph
and
charlotte
and
sébastien
and
sarah
smiled
at
him
and
stretched
out
their
clasped
hands
while
thérèse
and
françois
drawn
nearer
together
it
seemed
by
their
affection
for
the
august
old
man
seated
themselves
at
his
feet
at
last
marc
deeply
moved
almost
stifled
by
the
caresses
heaped
on
him
said
jestingly
with
a
pleasant
laugh
children
my
children
you
must
not
make
a
god
of
me
you
know
very
well
that
the
churches
are
being
shut
up
i
am
only
a
hard
worker
who
has
finished
his
day
besides
i
do
want
to
triumph
without
my
dear
geneviève
beside
me
he
drew
her
near
taking
her
by
the
arm
and
they
all
kissed
her
as
they
had
kissed
him
in
such
wise
that
the
husband
and
wife
once
parted
then
reconciled
and
from
that
time
commanding
all
possible
happiness
were
conjointly
glorified
in
that
elementary
classroom
among
those
humble
forms
on
which
again
and
again
the
children
all
the
generations
going
towards
the
happy
city
would
take
their
seats
and
that
was
marc
reward
for
all
his
years
of
courage
and
effort
he
saw
his
work
before
him
rome
had
lost
the
battle
france
was
saved
from
death
from
the
dust
and
ruin
in
which
catholic
nations
disappear
one
after
the
other
she
had
been
rid
of
the
clerical
faction
which
had
chosen
her
territory
as
its
battlefield
ravaging
her
fields
poisoning
her
people
striving
to
create
darkness
in
order
to
dominate
the
world
once
more
she
was
no
longer
threatened
with
burial
beneath
the
ashes
of
a
dead
religion
she
had
again
become
her
own
mistress
she
could
go
forward
to
her
destiny
as
a
liberating
and
power
and
if
she
had
conquered
it
was
solely
by
the
means
of
that
primary
education
which
had
extracted
the
humble
the
lowly
ones
of
her
country
districts
from
the
ignorance
of
slaves
from
the
deadly
imbecility
in
which
roman
catholicism
had
maintained
them
for
centuries
some
had
dared
to
say
the
poor
in
spirit
and
from
that
mortal
error
had
sprung
the
misery
of
two
thousand
years
the
legend
of
the
benefits
of
ignorance
now
appeared
like
a
prolonged
social
crime
poverty
dirt
superstition
falsehood
tyranny
woman
exploited
and
held
in
contempt
man
stupefied
and
mastered
every
physical
and
every
moral
ill
were
the
fruits
of
that
ignorance
which
had
been
fostered
intentionally
which
had
served
as
a
system
of
state
politics
and
religious
police
knowledge
alone
would
slay
mendacious
dogmas
disperse
those
who
traded
and
lived
on
them
and
become
the
source
of
wealth
whether
in
respect
to
the
harvests
of
the
soil
or
the
general
florescence
of
the
human
mind
no
happiness
had
never
had
its
abode
in
ignorance
it
lay
in
knowledge
which
will
change
the
frightful
field
of
material
and
moral
wretchedness
into
a
vast
and
fruitful
expanse
whose
