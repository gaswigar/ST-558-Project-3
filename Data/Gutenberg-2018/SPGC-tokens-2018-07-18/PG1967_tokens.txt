i
the
malady
of
the
age
on
a
fine
evening
in
the
month
of
september
a
man
about
thirty
years
of
age
was
leaning
on
the
parapet
of
that
quay
from
which
a
spectator
can
look
up
the
seine
from
the
jardin
des
plantes
to
and
down
along
the
vast
perspective
of
the
river
to
the
louvre
there
is
not
another
point
of
view
to
compare
with
it
in
the
capital
of
ideas
we
feel
ourselves
on
the
as
it
were
of
a
gigantic
vessel
we
dream
of
paris
from
the
days
of
the
romans
to
those
of
the
franks
from
the
normans
to
the
burgundians
the
the
valois
henri
louis
napoleon
and
vestiges
are
before
us
of
all
those
sovereignties
in
monuments
that
recall
their
memory
the
cupola
of
towers
above
the
latin
quarter
behind
us
rises
the
noble
apsis
of
the
cathedral
the
hotel
de
ville
tells
of
revolutions
the
of
the
miseries
of
paris
after
gazing
at
the
splendors
of
the
louvre
we
can
by
taking
two
steps
look
down
upon
the
rags
and
tatters
of
that
ignoble
nest
of
houses
huddling
between
the
quai
de
la
tournelle
and
the
a
foul
spot
which
a
modern
municipality
is
endeavoring
at
the
present
moment
to
remove
in
this
marvellous
scene
presented
still
another
lesson
to
the
eye
between
the
parisian
leaning
on
the
parapet
and
the
cathedral
lay
the
terrain
such
was
the
ancient
name
of
this
barren
spot
still
strewn
with
the
ruins
of
the
archiepiscopal
palace
when
we
contemplate
from
that
quay
so
many
commemorating
scenes
when
the
soul
has
grasped
the
past
as
it
does
the
present
of
this
city
of
paris
then
indeed
religion
seems
to
have
alighted
there
as
if
to
spread
her
hands
above
the
sorrows
of
both
banks
and
extend
her
arms
from
the
faubourg
to
the
faubourg
let
us
hope
that
this
sublime
unity
may
be
completed
by
the
erection
of
an
episcopal
palace
of
the
gothic
order
which
shall
replace
the
formless
buildings
now
standing
between
the
terrain
the
rue
d
arcole
the
cathedral
and
the
quai
de
la
cite
this
spot
the
heart
of
ancient
paris
is
the
loneliest
and
most
melancholy
of
regions
the
waters
of
the
seine
break
there
noisily
the
cathedral
casts
its
shadows
at
the
setting
of
the
sun
we
can
easily
believe
that
serious
thoughts
must
have
filled
the
mind
of
a
man
afflicted
with
a
moral
malady
as
he
leaned
upon
that
parapet
attracted
perhaps
by
the
harmony
between
his
thoughts
and
those
to
which
these
diverse
scenes
gave
birth
he
rested
his
hands
upon
the
coping
and
gave
way
to
a
double
contemplation
of
paris
and
of
himself
the
shadows
deepened
the
lights
shone
out
afar
but
still
he
did
not
move
carried
along
as
he
was
on
the
current
of
a
meditation
such
as
comes
to
many
of
us
big
with
the
future
and
rendered
solemn
by
the
past
after
a
while
he
heard
two
persons
coming
towards
him
whose
voices
had
caught
his
attention
on
the
bridge
which
joins
the
ile
de
la
cite
with
the
quai
de
la
tournelle
these
persons
no
doubt
thought
themselves
alone
and
therefore
spoke
louder
than
they
would
have
done
in
more
frequented
places
the
voices
betrayed
a
discussion
which
apparently
from
the
few
words
that
reached
the
ear
of
the
involuntary
listener
related
to
a
loan
of
money
just
as
the
pair
approached
the
quay
one
of
them
dressed
like
a
working
man
left
the
other
with
a
despairing
gesture
the
other
stopped
and
called
after
him
saying
you
have
not
a
sou
to
pay
your
way
across
the
bridge
take
this
he
added
giving
the
man
a
piece
of
money
and
remember
my
friend
that
god
himself
is
speaking
to
us
when
a
good
thought
comes
into
our
this
last
remark
made
the
dreamer
at
the
parapet
quiver
the
man
who
made
it
little
knew
that
to
use
a
proverbial
expression
he
was
killing
two
birds
with
one
stone
addressing
two
miseries
a
working
life
brought
to
despair
a
suffering
soul
without
a
compass
the
victim
of
what
panurge
s
sheep
call
progress
and
what
in
france
is
called
equality
the
words
simple
in
themselves
became
sublime
from
the
tone
of
him
who
said
them
in
a
voice
that
possesses
a
spell
are
there
not
in
fact
some
calm
and
tender
voices
that
produce
upon
us
the
same
effect
as
a
far
horizon
outlook
by
his
dress
the
dreamer
knew
him
to
be
a
priest
and
he
saw
by
the
last
gleams
of
the
fading
twilight
a
white
august
worn
face
the
sight
of
a
priest
issuing
from
the
beautiful
cathedral
of
in
vienna
bearing
the
extreme
unction
to
a
dying
person
determined
the
celebrated
tragic
author
werner
to
become
a
catholic
almost
the
same
effect
was
produced
upon
the
dreamer
when
he
looked
upon
the
man
who
had
all
unknowing
given
him
comfort
on
the
threatening
horizon
of
his
future
he
saw
a
luminous
space
where
shone
the
blue
of
ether
and
he
followed
that
light
as
the
shepherds
of
the
gospel
followed
the
voices
that
cried
to
them
christ
the
lord
is
born
this
the
man
who
had
said
the
beneficent
words
passed
on
by
the
wall
of
the
cathedral
taking
as
a
result
of
chance
which
often
leads
to
great
results
the
direction
of
the
street
from
which
the
dreamer
came
and
to
which
he
was
now
returning
led
by
the
faults
of
his
life
this
dreamer
was
named
godefroid
whoever
reads
this
history
will
understand
the
reasons
which
lead
the
writer
to
use
the
christian
names
only
of
some
who
are
mentioned
in
it
the
motives
which
led
godefroid
who
lived
in
the
quarter
of
the
antin
to
the
neighborhood
of
at
such
an
hour
were
as
follows
the
son
of
a
retail
shopkeeper
whose
economy
enabled
him
to
lay
by
a
sort
of
fortune
he
was
the
sole
object
of
ambition
to
his
father
and
mother
who
dreamed
of
seeing
him
a
notary
in
paris
for
this
reason
at
the
age
of
seven
he
was
sent
to
an
institution
that
of
the
abbe
liautard
to
be
thrown
among
children
of
distinguished
families
who
during
the
empire
chose
this
school
for
the
education
of
their
sons
in
preference
to
the
lyceums
where
religion
was
too
much
overlooked
social
inequalities
were
not
noticeable
among
schoolmates
but
in
his
studies
being
ended
godefroid
who
was
then
with
a
notary
became
aware
of
the
distance
that
separated
him
from
those
with
whom
he
had
hitherto
lived
on
familiar
terms
obliged
to
go
through
the
law
school
he
there
found
himself
among
a
crowd
of
the
sons
of
the
bourgeoisie
who
without
fortunes
to
inherit
or
hereditary
distinctions
could
look
only
to
their
own
personal
merits
or
to
persistent
toil
the
hopes
that
his
father
and
mother
then
retired
from
business
placed
upon
him
stimulated
the
youth
s
vanity
without
exciting
his
pride
his
parents
lived
simply
like
the
thrifty
dutch
spending
only
one
fourth
of
an
income
of
twelve
thousand
francs
they
intended
their
savings
together
with
half
their
capital
for
the
purchase
of
a
notary
s
practice
for
their
son
subjected
to
the
rule
of
this
domestic
economy
godefroid
found
his
immediate
state
so
disproportioned
to
the
visions
of
himself
and
his
parents
that
he
grew
discouraged
in
some
feeble
natures
discouragement
turns
to
envy
others
in
whom
necessity
will
reflection
stand
in
place
of
talent
march
straight
and
resolutely
in
the
path
traced
out
for
bourgeois
ambitions
godefroid
on
the
contrary
revolted
wished
to
shine
tried
several
brilliant
ways
and
blinded
his
eyes
he
endeavored
to
succeed
but
all
his
efforts
ended
in
proving
the
fact
of
his
own
impotence
admitting
at
last
the
inequality
that
existed
between
his
desires
and
his
capacities
he
began
to
hate
all
social
supremacies
became
a
liberal
and
attempted
to
reach
celebrity
by
writing
a
book
but
he
learned
to
his
cost
to
regard
talent
as
he
did
nobility
having
tried
the
law
the
notariat
and
literature
without
distinguishing
himself
in
any
way
his
mind
now
turned
to
the
magistracy
about
this
time
his
father
died
his
mother
who
contented
herself
in
her
old
age
with
two
thousand
francs
a
year
gave
the
rest
of
the
fortune
to
godefroid
thus
possessed
at
the
age
of
of
ten
thousand
francs
a
year
he
felt
himself
rich
and
he
was
so
relatively
to
the
past
until
then
his
life
had
been
spent
on
acts
without
will
on
wishes
that
were
impotent
now
to
advance
with
the
age
to
act
to
play
a
part
he
resolved
to
enter
some
career
or
find
some
connection
that
should
further
his
fortunes
he
first
thought
of
journalism
which
always
opens
its
arms
to
any
capital
that
may
come
in
its
way
to
be
the
owner
of
a
newspaper
is
to
become
a
personage
at
once
such
a
man
works
intellect
and
has
all
the
gratifications
of
it
and
none
of
the
labor
nothing
is
more
tempting
to
inferior
minds
than
to
be
able
to
rise
in
this
way
on
the
talents
of
others
paris
has
seen
two
or
three
parvenus
of
this
kind
men
whose
success
is
a
disgrace
both
to
the
epoch
and
to
those
who
have
lent
them
their
shoulders
in
this
sphere
godefroid
was
soon
outdone
by
the
brutal
machiavellianism
of
some
or
by
the
lavish
prodigality
of
others
by
the
fortunes
of
ambitious
capitalists
or
by
the
wit
and
shrewdness
of
editors
meantime
he
was
drawn
into
all
the
dissipations
that
arise
from
literary
or
political
life
and
he
yielded
to
the
temptations
incurred
by
journalists
behind
the
scenes
he
soon
found
himself
in
bad
company
but
this
experience
taught
him
that
his
appearance
was
insignificant
that
he
had
one
shoulder
higher
than
the
other
without
the
inequality
being
redeemed
by
either
malignancy
or
kindness
of
nature
such
were
the
truths
these
artists
made
him
feel
small
without
superiority
of
mind
or
settled
purpose
what
chance
was
there
for
a
man
like
that
in
an
age
when
success
in
any
career
demands
that
the
highest
qualities
of
the
mind
be
furthered
by
luck
or
by
tenacity
of
will
which
commands
luck
the
revolution
of
stanched
godefroid
s
wounds
he
had
the
courage
of
hope
which
is
equal
to
that
of
despair
he
obtained
an
appointment
like
other
obscure
journalists
to
a
government
situation
in
the
provinces
where
his
liberal
ideas
conflicting
with
the
necessities
of
the
new
power
made
him
a
troublesome
instrument
bitten
with
liberalism
he
did
not
know
as
cleverer
men
did
how
to
steer
a
course
obedience
to
ministers
he
regarded
as
sacrificing
his
opinions
besides
the
government
seemed
to
him
to
be
disobeying
the
laws
of
its
own
origin
godefroid
declared
for
progress
where
the
object
of
the
government
was
to
maintain
the
he
returned
to
paris
almost
poor
but
faithful
still
to
the
doctrines
of
the
opposition
alarmed
by
the
excesses
of
the
press
more
alarmed
still
by
the
attempted
outrages
of
the
republican
party
he
sought
in
retirement
from
the
world
the
only
life
suitable
for
a
being
whose
faculties
were
incomplete
and
without
sufficient
force
to
bear
up
against
the
rough
jostling
of
political
life
the
struggles
and
sufferings
of
which
confer
no
credit
a
being
too
who
was
wearied
with
his
many
miscarriages
without
friends
for
friendship
demands
either
striking
merits
or
striking
defects
and
yet
possessing
a
sensibility
of
soul
more
dreamy
than
profound
surely
a
retired
life
was
the
course
left
for
a
young
man
whom
pleasure
had
more
than
once
misled
whose
heart
was
already
aged
by
contact
with
a
world
as
restless
as
it
was
disappointing
his
mother
who
was
dying
in
the
peaceful
village
of
auteuil
recalled
her
son
to
live
with
her
partly
to
have
him
near
her
and
partly
to
put
him
in
the
way
of
finding
an
equable
tranquil
happiness
which
might
satisfy
a
soul
like
his
she
had
ended
by
judging
godefroid
finding
him
at
with
of
his
fortune
gone
his
desires
dulled
his
pretended
capacities
extinct
his
activity
dead
his
ambition
humbled
and
his
hatred
against
all
that
reached
legitimate
success
increased
by
his
own
shortcomings
she
tried
to
marry
him
to
an
excellent
young
girl
the
only
daughter
of
a
retired
merchant
a
woman
well
fitted
to
play
the
part
of
guardian
to
the
sickened
soul
of
her
son
but
the
father
had
the
business
spirit
which
never
abandons
an
old
merchant
especially
in
matrimonial
negotiations
and
after
a
year
of
attentions
and
neighborly
intercourse
godefroid
was
not
accepted
in
the
first
place
his
former
career
seemed
to
these
worthy
people
profoundly
immoral
then
during
this
very
year
he
had
made
still
further
inroads
into
his
capital
as
much
to
dazzle
the
parents
as
to
please
the
daughter
this
vanity
excusable
as
it
was
caused
his
final
rejection
by
the
family
who
held
dissipation
of
property
in
holy
horror
and
who
now
discovered
that
in
six
years
godefroid
had
spent
or
lost
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
of
his
capital
this
blow
struck
the
young
man
s
already
wounded
heart
the
more
deeply
because
the
girl
herself
had
no
personal
beauty
but
guided
by
his
mother
in
judging
her
character
he
had
ended
by
recognizing
in
the
woman
he
sought
the
great
value
of
an
earnest
soul
and
the
vast
advantages
of
a
sound
mind
he
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
face
he
had
studied
the
countenance
he
loved
the
voice
the
manners
the
glance
of
that
young
girl
having
cast
on
this
attachment
the
last
stake
of
his
life
the
disappointment
he
endured
was
the
bitterest
of
all
his
mother
died
and
he
found
himself
he
who
had
always
desired
luxury
with
five
thousand
francs
a
year
for
his
whole
fortune
and
with
the
certainty
that
never
in
his
future
life
could
he
repair
any
loss
whatsoever
for
he
felt
himself
incapable
of
the
effort
expressed
in
that
terrible
injunction
to
his
weak
impatient
grief
can
not
easily
be
shaken
off
during
his
mourning
godefroid
tried
the
various
chances
and
distractions
of
paris
he
dined
at
hotes
he
made
acquaintances
heedlessly
he
sought
society
with
no
result
but
that
of
increasing
his
expenditures
walking
along
the
boulevards
he
often
suffered
deeply
at
the
sight
of
a
mother
walking
with
a
marriageable
daughter
a
sight
which
caused
him
as
painful
an
emotion
as
he
formerly
felt
when
a
young
man
passed
him
riding
to
the
bois
or
driving
in
an
elegant
equipage
the
sense
of
his
impotence
told
him
that
he
could
never
hope
for
the
best
of
even
secondary
positions
nor
for
any
easily
won
career
and
he
had
heart
enough
to
feel
constantly
wounded
mind
enough
to
make
in
his
own
breast
the
bitterest
of
elegies
unfitted
to
struggle
against
circumstances
having
an
inward
consciousness
of
superior
faculties
without
the
will
that
could
put
them
in
action
feeling
himself
incomplete
without
force
to
undertake
any
great
thing
without
resistance
against
the
tastes
derived
from
his
earlier
life
his
education
and
his
indolence
he
was
the
victim
of
three
maladies
any
one
of
which
would
be
enough
to
sicken
of
life
a
young
man
long
alienated
from
religious
faith
thus
it
was
that
godefroid
presented
even
to
the
eye
the
face
that
we
meet
so
often
in
paris
that
it
might
be
called
the
type
of
the
parisian
in
it
we
may
see
ambitions
deceived
or
dead
inward
wretchedness
hatred
sleeping
in
the
indolence
of
a
life
passed
in
watching
the
daily
and
external
life
of
paris
apathy
which
seeks
stimulation
lament
without
talent
a
mimicry
of
strength
the
venom
of
past
disappointments
which
excites
to
cynicism
and
spits
upon
all
that
enlarges
and
grows
misconceives
all
necessary
authority
rejoicing
in
its
embarrassments
and
will
not
hold
to
any
social
form
this
parisian
malady
is
to
the
active
and
permanent
impulse
towards
conspiracy
in
persons

weary
of
himself
godefroid
attempted
one
day
to
give
a
meaning
to
his
life
after
meeting
a
former
comrade
who
had
been
the
tortoise
in
the
fable
while
he
in
earlier
days
had
been
the
hare
in
one
of
those
conversations
which
arise
when
schoolmates
meet
again
in
after
years
a
conversation
held
as
they
were
walking
together
in
the
sunshine
on
the
boulevard
des
italiens
he
was
startled
to
learn
the
success
of
a
man
endowed
apparently
with
less
gifts
less
means
less
fortune
than
himself
but
who
had
bent
his
will
each
morning
to
the
purpose
resolved
upon
the
night
before
the
sick
soul
then
determined
to
imitate
that
simple
action
social
existence
is
like
the
soil
his
comrade
had
said
to
him
it
makes
us
a
return
in
proportion
to
our
godefroid
was
in
debt
as
a
first
test
a
first
task
he
resolved
to
live
in
some
retired
place
and
pay
his
debts
from
his
income
to
a
man
accustomed
to
spend
six
thousand
francs
when
he
had
but
five
it
was
no
small
undertaking
to
bring
himself
to
live
on
two
thousand
every
morning
he
studied
advertisements
hoping
to
find
the
offer
of
some
asylum
where
his
expenses
could
be
fixed
where
he
might
have
the
solitude
a
man
wants
when
he
makes
a
return
upon
himself
examines
himself
and
endeavors
to
give
himself
a
vocation
the
manners
and
customs
of
bourgeois
shocked
his
delicacy
sanitariums
seemed
to
him
unhealthy
and
he
was
about
to
fall
back
into
the
fatal
irresolution
of
persons
without
will
when
the
following
advertisement
met
his
eye
to
let
a
small
lodging
for
seventy
francs

inquire
of
millet
grocer
rue
chanoinesse
near
where
all
further
information
can
be
attracted
by
a
certain
kindliness
concealed
beneath
these
words
and
the
air
which
exhaled
from
them
godefroid
had
on
the
afternoon
when
we
found
him
on
the
quay
called
at
four
o
clock
on
the
grocer
who
told
him
that
madame
de
la
chanterie
was
then
dining
and
did
not
receive
any
one
when
at
her
meals
the
lady
he
said
was
visible
in
the
evening
after
seven
o
clock
or
in
the
morning
between
ten
and
twelve
while
speaking
monsieur
millet
examined
godefroid
and
made
him
submit
to
what
magistrates
call
the
first
degree
of
was
monsieur
unmarried
madame
wished
a
person
of
regular
habits
the
gate
was
closed
at
eleven
at
the
latest
monsieur
certainly
seemed
of
an
age
to
suit
madame
de
la
how
old
do
you
think
me
asked
godefroid
about
forty
replied
the
grocer
this
ingenuous
answer
threw
the
young
man
into
a
state
of
misanthropic
gloom
he
went
off
and
dined
at
a
restaurant
on
the
quai
de
la
tournelle
and
afterwards
went
to
the
parapet
to
contemplate
at
the
moment
when
the
fires
of
the
setting
sun
were
rippling
and
breaking
about
the
manifold
buttresses
of
the
apsis
the
young
man
was
floating
between
the
promptings
of
despair
and
the
moving
voice
of
religious
harmonies
sounding
in
the
bell
of
the
cathedral
when
amid
the
shadows
the
silence
the
light
of
the
moon
he
heard
the
words
of
the
priest
though
like
most
of
the
sons
of
our
century
he
was
far
from
religious
his
sensibilities
were
touched
by
those
words
and
he
returned
to
the
rue
chanoinesse
although
he
had
almost
made
up
his
mind
not
to
do
so
the
priest
and
godefroid
were
both
surprised
when
they
entered
together
the
rue
massilon
which
is
opposite
to
the
small
north
portal
of
the
cathedral
and
turned
together
into
the
rue
chanoinesse
at
the
point
where
towards
the
rue
de
la
colombe
it
becomes
the
rue
des
marmousets
when
godefroid
stopped
before
the
arched
portal
of
madame
de
la
chanterie
s
house
the
priest
turned
towards
him
and
examined
him
by
the
light
of
the
hanging
probably
one
of
the
last
to
disappear
from
the
heart
of
old
paris
have
you
come
to
see
madame
de
la
chanterie
monsieur
said
the
priest
yes
replied
godefroid
the
words
i
heard
you
say
to
that
workman
show
me
that
if
you
live
here
this
house
must
be
salutary
for
the
then
you
were
a
witness
of
my
defeat
said
the
priest
raising
the
knocker
of
the
door
for
i
did
not
i
thought
on
the
contrary
it
was
the
workman
who
did
not
succeed
he
demanded
money
alas
replied
the
priest
one
of
the
great
evils
of
revolutions
in
france
is
that
each
offers
a
fresh
premium
to
the
ambitions
of
the
lower
classes
to
get
out
of
his
condition
to
make
his
fortune
which
is
regarded
as
the
only
social
standard
the
throws
himself
into
some
of
those
monstrous
associations
which
if
they
do
not
succeed
ought
to
bring
the
speculators
to
account
before
human
justice
this
is
what
trusts
often
lead
the
porter
opened
a
heavy
door
the
priest
said
to
godefroid
monsieur
has
perhaps
come
about
the
little
suite
of
rooms
yes
the
priest
and
godefroid
then
crossed
a
wide
courtyard
at
the
farther
end
of
which
loomed
darkly
a
tall
house
flanked
by
a
square
tower
which
rose
above
the
roof
and
appeared
to
be
in
a
dilapidated
condition
whoever
knows
the
history
of
paris
knows
that
the
soil
before
and
around
the
cathedral
has
been
so
raised
that
there
is
not
a
vestige
now
of
the
twelve
steps
which
formerly
led
up
to
it
the
base
of
the
columns
of
the
porch
is
on
a
level
with
the
pavement
consequently
what
was
once
the
of
the
house
of
which
we
speak
is
now
its
cellar
a
portico
reached
by
a
few
steps
leads
to
the
entrance
of
the
tower
in
which
a
spiral
stairway
winds
up
round
a
central
shaft
carved
with
a
this
style
which
recalls
the
stairways
of
louis
xii
at
the
chateau
of
blois
dates
from
the
fourteenth
century
struck
by
these
and
other
evidences
of
antiquity
godefroid
could
not
help
saying
with
a
smile
to
the
priest
this
tower
is
not
of
it
sustained
they
say
an
assault
of
the
normans
and
probably
formed
part
of
the
first
palace
of
the
kings
of
paris
but
according
to
actual
tradition
it
was
certainly
the
dwelling
of
the
famous
canon
fulbert
the
uncle
of
as
he
ended
these
words
the
priest
opened
the
door
of
the
apartment
which
appeared
now
to
be
the
of
the
house
but
was
in
reality
towards
both
the
front
and
back
courtyard
for
there
was
a
small
interior
court
on
the
first
floor
in
the
antechamber
a
wearing
a
cambric
cap
with
fluted
frills
for
its
sole
decoration
was
knitting
by
the
light
of
a
little
lamp
she
stuck
her
needles
into
her
hair
held
her
work
in
her
hand
and
rose
to
open
the
door
of
a
salon
which
looked
out
on
the
inner
court
the
dress
of
the
woman
was
somewhat
like
that
of
the
sisters
of
mercy
madame
i
bring
you
a
tenant
said
the
priest
ushering
godefroid
into
the
salon
where
the
latter
saw
three
persons
sitting
in
armchairs
near
madame
de
la
chanterie
these
three
persons
rose
the
mistress
of
the
house
rose
then
when
the
priest
had
drawn
up
another
armchair
for
godefroid
and
when
the
future
tenant
had
seated
himself
in
obedience
to
a
gesture
of
madame
de
la
chanterie
accompanied
by
the
words
be
seated
monsieur
the
man
of
the
boulevards
fancied
himself
at
some
enormous
distance
from
paris
in
lower
brittany
or
the
wilds
of
canada
silence
has
perhaps
its
own
degrees
godefroid
already
penetrated
with
the
silence
of
the
rues
massillon
and
chanoinesse
where
two
carriages
do
not
pass
in
a
month
and
grasped
by
the
silence
of
the
courtyard
and
the
tower
may
have
felt
that
he
had
reached
the
very
heart
of
silence
in
this
still
salon
guarded
by
so
many
old
streets
old
courts
old
walls
this
part
of
the
ile
which
is
called
the
cloister
has
preserved
the
character
of
all
cloisters
it
is
damp
cold
and
monastically
silent
even
at
the
noisiest
hours
of
the
day
it
will
be
remarked
also
that
this
portion
of
the
cite
crowded
between
the
flank
of
and
the
river
faces
the
north
and
is
always
in
the
shadow
of
the
cathedral
the
east
winds
swirl
through
it
unopposed
and
the
fogs
of
the
seine
are
caught
and
retained
by
the
black
walls
of
the
old
metropolitan
church
no
one
will
therefore
be
surprised
at
the
sensations
godefroid
felt
when
he
found
himself
in
this
old
dwelling
in
presence
of
four
silent
human
beings
who
seemed
as
solemn
as
the
things
which
surrounded
them
he
did
not
look
about
him
being
seized
with
curiosity
as
to
madame
de
la
chanterie
whose
name
was
already
a
puzzle
to
him
this
lady
was
evidently
a
person
of
another
epoch
not
to
say
of
another
world
her
face
was
placid
its
tones
both
soft
and
cold
the
nose
aquiline
the
forehead
full
of
sweetness
the
eyes
brown
the
chin
double
and
all
were
framed
in
silvery
white
hair
her
gown
could
only
be
called
by
its
ancient
name
of
fourreau
so
tightly
was
she
sheathed
within
it
after
the
fashion
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
material
a
brown
silk
with
very
fine
and
multiplied
green
lines
seemed
also
of
that
period
the
bodice
which
was
one
with
the
skirt
was
partly
hidden
beneath
a
mantle
of
edged
with
black
lace
and
fastened
on
the
bosom
by
a
brooch
enclosing
a
miniature
her
feet
in
black
velvet
boots
rested
on
a
cushion
madame
de
la
chanterie
like
her
maid
was
knitting
a
stocking
and
she
too
had
a
needle
stuck
through
her
white
curls
beneath
the
lace
of
her
cap
have
you
seen
monsieur
millet
she
said
to
godefroid
in
the
head
voice
peculiar
to
the
dowagers
of
the
faubourg
observing
that
her
visitor
seemed
confused
and
as
if
to
put
the
words
into
his
mouth
yes
i
fear
that
the
apartment
will
scarcely
suit
you
she
said
noticing
the
elegance
and
newness
of
his
clothes
godefroid
was
wearing
polished
leather
boots
yellow
gloves
handsome
studs
and
a
very
pretty
gold
chain
passed
through
the
buttonhole
of
his
waistcoat
of
black
silk
with
blue
flowers
madame
de
la
chanterie
took
a
little
silver
whistle
from
her
pocket
and
blew
it
the
came
manon
my
child
show
this
gentleman
the
apartment
would
you
my
dear
vicar
be
so
kind
as
to
accompany
him
she
said
addressing
the
priest
if
by
chance
she
added
rising
and
again
looking
at
godefroid
the
apartment
suits
you
we
will
talk
of
the
godefroid
bowed
and
went
out
he
heard
the
rattle
of
keys
which
manon
took
from
a
drawer
and
he
saw
her
light
the
candle
in
a
large
brass
candlestick
manon
went
first
without
uttering
a
word
when
godefroid
found
himself
again
on
the
staircase
winding
up
two
flights
he
doubted
the
reality
of
life
he
dreamed
awake
he
saw
with
his
eyes
the
fantastic
world
of
romances
he
had
read
in
his
idle
hours
any
parisian
leaving
as
he
did
the
modern
quarter
with
its
luxury
of
houses
and
furniture
the
glitter
of
its
restaurants
and
theatres
the
tumult
and
movement
of
the
heart
of
paris
would
have
shared
his
feeling
the
candle
carried
by
the
woman
feebly
lighted
the
winding
stair
where
spiders
swung
their
draperies
gray
with
dust
manon
wore
a
petticoat
with
heavy
plaits
of
a
coarse
woollen
stuff
the
bodice
was
square
before
and
square
behind
and
all
her
clothes
seemed
to
hang
together
when
she
reached
the
second
floor
which
it
will
be
remembered
was
actually
the
third
manon
stopped
turned
a
key
in
an
ancient
lock
and
opened
a
door
painted
in
a
coarse
imitation
of
mahogany
this
is
it
she
said
entering
first
was
it
a
miser
was
it
an
artist
dying
in
penury
was
it
a
cynic
to
whom
the
world
was
naught
or
some
religious
soul
detached
from
life
who
had
occupied
this
apartment
that
triple
question
might
well
be
asked
by
one
who
breathed
the
odor
of
that
poverty
who
saw
the
greasy
spots
upon
the
papers
yellow
with
smoke
the
blackened
ceilings
the
dusty
windows
with
their
casement
panes
the
discolored
the
wainscots
layered
with
a
sort
of
sticky
glaze
a
damp
chill
came
from
the
chimneys
with
their
mantels
of
painted
stone
surmounted
by
mirrors
in
panels
of
the
style
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
apartment
was
square
like
the
house
and
looked
out
upon
the
inner
court
which
could
not
now
be
seen
because
of
the
darkness
who
has
lived
here
asked
godefroid
of
the
priest
a
former
councillor
of
the
parliament
a
of
madame
monsieur
de
boisfrelon
after
the
revolution
he
fell
into
dotage
but
he
did
not
die
until
at
the
age
of
madame
could
not
at
first
make
up
her
mind
to
let
his
rooms
to
a
stranger
but
she
finds
she
can
not
afford
to
lose
the
madame
will
have
the
apartment
cleaned
and
furnished
in
a
manner
to
satisfy
monsieur
said
manon
that
will
depend
on
the
arrangement
you
make
with
her
said
the
priest
you
have
here
a
fine
parlor
a
large
and
closet
and
those
little
rooms
in
the
angle
will
make
an
excellent
study
it
is
the
same
arrangement
as
in
my
apartment
below
also
in
the
one
yes
said
manon
monsieur
alain
s
apartment
is
just
like
this
only
his
has
a
view
of
the
i
think
i
had
better
see
the
rooms
by
daylight
said
godefroid
timidly
perhaps
so
said
manon
the
priest
and
godefroid
went
downstairs
leaving
the
woman
to
lock
the
doors
when
they
the
salon
godefroid
who
was
getting
inured
to
the
surroundings
looked
about
him
while
discoursing
with
madame
de
la
chanterie
and
examined
the
persons
and
things
there
present
the
salon
had
curtains
at
its
windows
of
old
red
damask
with
lambrequins
tied
back
at
the
sides
with
silken
cords
the
floor
showed
at
the
edges
of
an
old
tapestry
carpet
too
small
to
cover
the
whole
room
the
woodwork
was
painted
gray
the
plastered
ceiling
divided
in
two
parts
by
a
heavy
beam
which
started
from
the
fireplace
seemed
a
concession
tardily
made
to
luxury
armchairs
with
their
woodwork
painted
white
were
covered
with
tapestry
a
paltry
clock
between
two
candlesticks
decorated
the
beside
madame
de
la
chanterie
was
an
ancient
table
with
spindle
legs
on
which
lay
her
balls
of
worsted
in
a
wicker
basket
a
hydrostatic
lamp
lighted
the
scene
the
four
men
who
were
seated
there
silent
immovable
like
bronze
statues
had
evidently
stopped
their
conversation
with
madame
de
la
chanterie
when
they
heard
the
stranger
returning
they
all
had
cold
discreet
faces
in
keeping
with
the
room
the
house
the
quarter
of
the
town
madame
de
la
chanterie
admitted
the
justice
of
godefroid
s
observations
but
told
him
that
she
did
not
wish
to
make
any
change
until
she
knew
the
intentions
of
her
lodger
or
rather
her
boarder
if
he
would
conform
to
the
customs
of
the
house
he
could
become
her
boarder
but
these
customs
were
widely
different
from
those
of
paris
life
in
the
rue
chanoinesse
was
like
provincial
life
the
lodger
must
always
be
in
by
ten
o
clock
at
night
they
disliked
noise
and
could
have
no
women
or
children
to
break
up
their
customary
habits
an
ecclesiastic
might
conform
to
these
ways
madame
de
la
chanterie
desired
above
all
some
one
of
simple
life
who
would
not
be
exacting
she
could
afford
to
put
only
the
strictest
necessaries
into
the
apartment
monsieur
alain
here
she
designated
one
of
the
four
men
present
was
satisfied
and
she
would
do
for
a
new
tenant
just
as
she
did
for
the
others
i
do
not
think
said
the
priest
that
monsieur
is
inclined
to
enter
our
eh
why
not
said
monsieur
alain
we
are
all
well
off
here
we
have
nothing
to
complain
madame
said
godefroid
rising
i
shall
have
the
honor
of
calling
again
though
he
was
a
young
man
the
four
old
men
and
madame
de
la
chanterie
rose
and
the
vicar
accompanied
him
to
the
portico
a
whistle
sounded
at
that
signal
the
porter
came
with
a
lantern
guided
godefroid
to
the
street
and
closed
behind
him
the
enormous
yellow
door
ponderous
as
that
of
a
prison
and
decorated
with
arabesque
ironwork
of
a
remote
period
that
was
difficult
to
determine
though
godefroid
got
into
a
cabriolet
and
was
soon
rolling
into
the
living
lighted
glowing
regions
of
paris
what
he
had
seen
still
appeared
to
him
a
dream
and
his
impressions
as
he
made
his
way
along
the
boulevard
des
italiens
had
already
the
remoteness
of
a
memory
he
asked
himself
shall
i
find
those
people
there
iii
the
house
of
mongenod
the
next
day
as
godefroid
rose
amid
the
appointments
of
modern
luxury
and
the
choice
appliances
of
english
comfort
he
remembered
the
details
of
his
visit
to
that
cloister
of
and
the
meaning
of
the
things
he
had
seen
there
came
into
his
mind
the
three
unknown
and
silent
men
whose
dress
attitude
and
stillness
acted
powerfully
upon
him
were
no
doubt
boarders
like
the
priest
the
solemnity
of
madame
de
la
chanterie
now
seemed
to
him
a
secret
dignity
with
which
she
bore
some
great
misfortune
but
still
in
spite
of
the
explanations
which
godefroid
gave
himself
he
could
not
help
fancying
there
was
an
air
of
mystery
about
those
sober
figures
he
looked
around
him
and
selected
the
pieces
of
furniture
that
he
would
keep
those
that
were
indispensable
to
him
but
when
he
transported
them
in
thought
to
the
miserable
lodging
in
the
rue
chanoinesse
he
began
to
laugh
at
the
contrast
they
would
make
there
resolving
to
sell
all
and
let
madame
de
la
chanterie
furnish
the
rooms
for
him
he
wanted
a
new
life
and
the
very
sight
of
these
objects
would
remind
him
of
that
which
he
wished
to
forget
in
his
desire
for
transformation
for
he
belonged
to
those
characters
who
spring
at
a
bound
into
the
middle
of
a
situation
instead
of
advancing
as
others
do
step
by
step
he
was
seized
while
he
breakfasted
with
an
idea
he
would
turn
his
whole
property
into
money
pay
his
debts
and
place
the
remainder
of
his
capital
in
the
with
which
his
father
had
done
business
this
house
was
the
firm
of
mongenod
and
company
established
in
or
whose
reputation
for
honesty
and
uprightness
had
never
been
questioned
in
the
midst
of
the
commercial
depravity
which
smirched
more
or
less
all
the
of
paris
in
spite
of
their
immense
wealth
the
houses
of
nucingen
du
tillet
the
keller
brothers
palma
and
company
were
each
regarded
more
or
less
with
secret
disrespect
although
it
is
true
this
disrespect
was
only
whispered
evil
means
had
produced
such
fine
results
such
political
successes
dynastic
principles
covered
so
completely
base
workings
that
no
one
in
thought
of
the
mud
in
which
the
roots
of
these
fine
trees
the
mainstay
of
the
state
were
plunged
nevertheless
there
was
not
a
single
one
of
those
great
bankers
to
whom
the
confidence
expressed
in
the
house
of
mongenod
was
not
a
wound
like
english
houses
the
mongenods
made
no
external
display
of
luxury
they
lived
in
dignified
stillness
satisfied
to
do
their
business
prudently
wisely
and
with
a
stern
uprightness
which
enabled
them
to
carry
it
from
one
end
of
the
globe
to
the
other
the
actual
head
of
the
house
frederic
mongenod
is
the
of
the
vicomte
de
fontaine
therefore
this
numerous
family
is
allied
through
the
baron
de
fontaine
to
monsieur
grossetete
the
brother
of
the
grossetete
and
company
of
limoges
to
the
vandenesses
and
to
planat
de
baudry
another
these
connections
having
procured
for
the
late
mongenod
father
of
the
present
head
of
the
house
many
favors
in
the
financial
operations
under
the
restoration
obtained
for
him
also
the
confidence
of
the
old
whose
property
and
whose
savings
which
were
immense
were
deposited
in
this
bank
far
from
coveting
a
peerage
like
the
kellers
nucingen
and
du
tillet
the
mongenods
kept
away
from
politics
and
only
knew
as
much
about
them
as
their
banking
interests
demanded
the
house
of
mongenod
is
established
in
a
fine
old
mansion
in
the
rue
de
la
victoire
where
madame
mongenod
the
mother
lived
with
her
two
sons
all
three
being
partners
in
the
house
the
share
of
the
vicomtesse
de
fontaine
having
been
bought
out
by
them
on
the
death
of
the
elder
mongenod
in
frederic
mongenod
a
handsome
young
man
about
years
of
age
cold
silent
and
reserved
in
manner
like
a
swiss
and
neat
as
an
englishman
had
acquired
by
intercourse
with
his
father
all
the
qualities
necessary
for
his
difficult
profession
better
educated
than
the
generality
of
bankers
his
studies
had
the
breadth
and
universality
which
characterize
the
polytechnic
training
and
he
had
like
most
bankers
predilections
and
tastes
outside
of
his
business
he
loved
mechanics
and
chemistry
the
second
brother
who
was
ten
years
younger
than
frederic
held
the
same
position
in
the
office
of
his
elder
brother
that
a
head
clerk
holds
in
that
of
a
notary
or
lawyer
frederic
trained
him
as
he
had
himself
been
trained
by
his
father
in
the
variety
of
knowledge
necessary
to
a
true
banker
who
is
to
money
what
a
writer
is
to
ideas
they
must
both
know
all
of
that
with
which
they
have
to
deal
when
godefroid
reached
the
banking
house
and
gave
his
name
he
saw
at
once
the
estimation
in
which
his
father
had
been
held
for
he
was
ushered
through
the
offices
without
delay
to
the
private
of
the
mongenods
this
was
closed
with
a
glass
door
so
that
godefroid
without
any
desire
to
listen
overheard
as
he
approached
it
what
was
being
said
there
madame
your
account
is
balanced
to
sixteen
hundred
thousand
francs
said
the
younger
mongenod
i
do
not
know
what
my
brother
s
intentions
are
he
alone
can
say
whether
an
advance
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
can
be
made
you
must
have
been
imprudent
sixteen
hundred
thousand
francs
should
not
be
entrusted
to
any
do
not
speak
so
loud
louis
said
a
woman
s
voice
your
brother
has
often
told
you
to
speak
in
a
low
voice
there
may
be
some
one
in
the
next
at
this
moment
frederic
mongenod
himself
opened
the
door
of
communication
between
his
private
house
and
the
he
saw
godefroid
and
crossed
the
room
bowing
respectfully
to
the
lady
who
was
conversing
with
his
brother
to
whom
have
i
the
honor
of
speaking
he
said
to
godefroid
as
soon
as
godefroid
gave
his
name
frederic
begged
him
to
be
seated
and
as
the
banker
opened
the
lid
of
his
desk
louis
mongenod
and
the
lady
who
was
no
other
than
madame
de
la
chanterie
rose
and
went
up
to
him
all
three
then
moved
into
the
embrasure
of
a
window
and
talked
in
a
low
voice
with
madame
mongenod
the
mother
who
was
sitting
there
and
to
whom
all
the
affairs
of
the
bank
were
confided
for
over
thirty
years
this
woman
had
given
to
her
husband
first
and
then
to
her
sons
such
proofs
of
business
sagacity
that
she
had
long
been
a
managing
partner
in
the
firm
and
signed
for
it
godefroid
as
he
looked
about
him
noticed
on
a
shelf
certain
boxes
ticketed
with
the
words
de
la
chanterie
and
numbered
to
when
the
conference
was
ended
by
the
banker
saying
to
his
brother
very
good
go
down
to
the
cashier
madame
de
la
chanterie
turned
round
saw
godefroid
checked
a
gesture
of
surprise
and
asked
a
few
questions
of
the
banker
in
a
low
voice
to
which
he
replied
in
a
few
words
spoken
equally
in
a
whisper
madame
de
la
chanterie
now
wore
gray
silk
stockings
and
small
prunella
shoes
her
gown
was
the
same
as
before
but
she
was
wrapped
in
a
venetian
mantua
a
sort
of
cloak
which
was
just
then
returning
into
fashion
on
her
head
was
a
drawn
bonnet
of
green
silk
lined
with
white
silk
of
a
style
called
la
bonne
her
face
was
framed
by
a
cloud
of
lace
she
held
herself
very
erect
in
an
attitude
which
bespoke
if
not
noble
birth
certainly
the
habits
of
an
aristocratic
life
without
the
extreme
affability
of
her
manner
she
might
have
seemed
haughty
she
was
certainly
imposing
it
is
the
will
of
providence
rather
than
mere
chance
that
has
brought
us
here
together
monsieur
she
said
to
godefroid
for
i
had
almost
decided
to
refuse
a
lodger
whose
ways
of
life
seemed
to
me
quite
antipathetic
to
those
of
my
household
but
monsieur
mongenod
has
just
given
me
some
information
about
your
family
which
ah
madame
monsieur
said
godefroid
addressing
both
madame
de
la
chanterie
and
the
banker
i
have
no
longer
a
family
and
i
have
come
here
now
to
ask
some
financial
advice
of
my
father
s
business
advisers
as
to
the
best
method
of
adapting
my
means
to
a
new
way
of
godefroid
then
succinctly
and
in
as
few
words
as
possible
related
his
history
and
expressed
his
desire
to
change
his
existence
formerly
he
said
a
man
in
my
position
would
have
made
himself
a
monk
but
there
are
no
longer
any
religious
go
and
live
with
madame
if
she
is
willing
to
take
you
said
frederic
mongenod
after
exchanging
a
glance
with
madame
de
la
chanterie
and
do
not
sell
out
your
property
leave
it
in
my
hands
give
me
the
exact
amount
of
your
debts
i
will
agree
with
your
creditors
for
payment
at
certain
dates
and
you
can
have
for
yourself
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
francs
a
month
it
will
thus
take
two
years
to
clear
you
during
those
two
years
if
you
take
those
quiet
lodgings
you
will
have
time
to
think
of
a
career
especially
among
the
persons
with
whom
you
will
live
who
are
all
good
here
louis
mongenod
returned
bringing
in
his
hand
a
hundred
notes
of
a
thousand
francs
each
which
he
gave
to
madame
de
la
chanterie
godefroid
offered
his
arm
to
his
future
hostess
and
took
her
down
to
the
which
was
waiting
for
her
i
hope
i
shall
see
you
soon
monsieur
she
said
in
a
cordial
tone
of
voice
at
what
hour
shall
you
be
at
home
madame
he
asked
at
two
o
i
shall
have
time
to
sell
my
furniture
he
said
as
he
bowed
to
her
during
the
short
time
that
madame
de
la
chanterie
s
arm
rested
upon
his
as
they
walked
to
the
carriage
godefroid
could
not
escape
the
glamour
of
the
words
your
account
is
for
sixteen
hundred
thousand
francs
words
said
by
louis
mongenod
to
the
woman
whose
life
was
spent
in
the
depths
of
the
cloisters
of
the
thought
she
must
be
rich
entirely
changed
his
way
of
looking
at
the
matter
how
old
is
she
he
began
to
ask
himself
and
a
vision
of
a
romance
in
the
rue
chanoinesse
came
to
him
she
certainly
has
an
air
of
nobility
can
she
be
concerned
in
some
bank
thought
he
in
our
day
nine
hundred
and
young
men
out
of
a
thousand
in
godefroid
s
position
would
have
had
the
thought
of
marrying
that
woman
a
furniture
dealer
who
also
had
apartments
to
let
paid
about
three
thousand
francs
for
the
articles
godefroid
was
willing
to
sell
and
agreed
to
let
him
keep
them
during
the
few
days
that
were
needed
to
prepare
the
shabby
apartment
in
the
rue
chanoinesse
for
this
lodger
with
a
sick
mind
godefroid
went
there
at
once
and
obtained
from
madame
de
la
chanterie
the
address
of
a
painter
who
for
a
moderate
sum
agreed
to
whiten
the
ceilings
clean
the
windows
paint
the
woodwork
and
stain
the
floors
within
a
week
godefroid
took
the
measure
of
the
rooms
intending
to
put
the
same
carpet
in
all
of
them
a
green
carpet
of
the
cheapest
kind
he
wished
for
the
plainest
uniformity
in
this
retreat
and
madame
de
la
chanterie
approved
of
the
idea
she
calculated
with
manon
s
assistance
the
number
of
yards
of
white
calico
required
for
the
window
curtains
and
also
for
those
of
the
modest
iron
bed
and
she
undertook
to
buy
and
have
them
made
for
a
price
so
moderate
as
to
surprise
godefroid
having
brought
with
him
a
certain
amount
of
furniture
the
whole
cost
of
fitting
up
the
rooms
proved
to
be
not
over
six
hundred
francs
we
lead
here
said
madame
de
la
chanterie
a
christian
life
which
does
not
as
you
know
accord
with
many
superfluities
i
think
you
have
too
many
as
it
in
giving
this
hint
to
her
future
lodger
she
looked
at
a
diamond
which
gleamed
in
the
ring
through
which
godefroid
s
blue
cravat
was
slipped
i
only
speak
of
this
she
added
because
of
the
intention
you
expressed
to
abandon
the
frivolous
life
you
complained
of
to
monsieur
godefroid
looked
at
madame
de
la
chanterie
as
he
listened
to
the
harmonies
of
her
limpid
voice
he
examined
that
face
so
purely
white
resembling
those
of
the
cold
grave
women
of
holland
whom
the
flemish
painters
have
so
wonderfully
reproduced
with
their
smooth
skins
in
which
a
wrinkle
is
impossible
white
and
plump
he
said
to
himself
as
he
walked
away
but
her
hair
is
white
godefroid
like
all
weak
natures
took
readily
to
a
new
life
believing
it
satisfactory
and
he
was
now
quite
eager
to
take
up
his
abode
in
the
rue
chanoinesse
nevertheless
a
prudent
thought
or
if
you
prefer
to
say
so
a
distrustful
thought
occurred
to
him
two
days
before
his
installation
he
went
again
to
see
monsieur
mongenod
to
obtain
some
more
definite
information
about
the
house
he
was
to
enter
during
the
few
moments
he
had
spent
in
his
future
lodgings
overlooking
the
changes
that
were
being
made
in
them
he
had
noticed
the
coming
and
going
of
several
persons
whose
appearance
and
behavior
without
being
exactly
mysterious
excited
a
belief
that
some
secret
occupation
or
profession
was
being
carried
on
in
that
house
at
that
particular
period
there
was
much
talk
of
attempts
by
the
elder
branch
of
the
bourbons
to
recover
the
throne
and
godefroid
suspected
some
conspiracy
when
he
found
himself
in
the
banker
s
held
by
the
scrutinizing
eye
of
frederic
mongenod
while
he
made
his
inquiry
he
felt
ashamed
as
he
saw
a
derisive
smile
on
the
lips
of
the
listener
madame
la
baronne
de
la
chanterie
replied
the
banker
is
one
of
the
most
obscure
persons
in
paris
but
she
is
also
one
of
the
most
honorable
have
you
any
object
in
asking
for
information
godefroid
retreated
into
generalities
he
was
going
to
live
among
strangers
he
naturally
wished
to
know
something
of
those
with
whom
he
should
be
intimately
thrown
but
the
banker
s
smile
became
more
and
more
sarcastic
and
godefroid
more
and
more
embarrassed
was
ashamed
of
the
step
he
had
taken
and
which
bore
no
fruit
for
he
dared
not
continue
his
questions
about
madame
de
la
chanterie
and
her
inmates
iv
farewell
to
the
life
of
the
world
two
days
later
of
a
monday
evening
having
dined
for
the
last
time
at
the
cafe
anglais
and
seen
the
two
first
pieces
at
the
varietes
he
went
at
ten
o
clock
to
sleep
for
the
first
time
in
the
rue
chanoinesse
where
manon
conducted
him
to
his
room
solitude
has
charms
comparable
only
to
those
of
savage
life
which
no
european
has
ever
really
abandoned
after
once
tasting
them
this
may
seem
strange
at
an
epoch
when
every
one
lives
so
much
to
be
seen
of
others
that
all
the
world
concern
themselves
in
their
neighbors
affairs
and
when
private
life
will
soon
be
a
thing
of
the
past
so
bold
and
so
intrusive
are
the
eyes
of
the
press
that
modern
argus
nevertheless
it
is
a
truth
which
rests
on
the
authority
of
the
first
six
christian
centuries
during
which
no
recluse
ever
returned
to
social
life
few
are
the
moral
wounds
that
solitude
will
not
heal
so
at
first
godefroid
was
soothed
by
the
deep
peace
and
absolute
stillness
of
his
new
abode
as
a
weary
traveller
is
relaxed
by
a
bath
the
very
day
after
his
arrival
at
madame
de
la
chanterie
s
he
was
forced
to
examine
himself
under
the
sense
that
he
was
separated
from
all
even
from
paris
though
he
still
lived
in
the
shadow
of
its
cathedral
stripped
of
his
social
vanities
he
was
about
to
have
no
other
witnesses
of
his
acts
than
his
own
conscience
and
the
inmates
of
that
house
he
had
quitted
the
great
of
the
world
to
enter
an
unknown
path
where
was
that
path
to
lead
him
to
to
what
occupation
should
he
now
be
drawn
he
had
been
for
two
hours
absorbed
in
such
reflections
when
manon
the
only
servant
of
the
house
knocked
at
his
door
to
tell
him
that
the
second
breakfast
was
served
and
the
family
were
waiting
for
him
twelve
o
clock
was
striking
the
new
lodger
went
down
at
once
stirred
by
a
wish
to
see
and
judge
the
five
persons
among
whom
his
life
was
in
future
to
be
spent
when
he
entered
the
room
he
found
all
the
inmates
of
the
house
standing
they
were
dressed
precisely
as
they
were
on
the
day
when
he
came
to
make
his
first
inquiries
did
you
sleep
well
asked
madame
de
la
chanterie
so
well
that
i
did
not
wake
up
till
ten
o
clock
replied
godefroid
bowing
to
the
four
men
who
returned
the
bow
with
gravity
we
thought
so
said
an
old
man
named
alain
smiling
manon
spoke
of
a
second
breakfast
said
godefroid
but
i
fear
that
i
have
already
broken
some
rule
at
what
hour
do
you
rise
not
quite
so
early
as
the
old
monks
said
madame
de
la
chanterie
courteously
but
as
early
as
the
six
in
winter
three
in
summer
our
is
ruled
by
that
of
the
sun
we
are
always
asleep
by
nine
in
winter
and
eleven
in
summer
on
rising
we
all
take
a
little
milk
which
comes
from
our
farm
after
saying
our
prayers
except
the
abbe
de
veze
who
says
the
first
mass
at
six
o
clock
in
summer
and
seven
o
clock
in
winter
at
where
these
gentlemen
are
present
daily
as
well
as
your
humble
madame
de
la
chanterie
ended
her
explanation
as
the
five
lodgers
took
their
seats
at
table
the
painted
throughout
in
gray
the
design
of
the
woodwork
being
in
the
style
of
louis
adjoined
the
sort
of
antechamber
in
which
manon
was
usually
stationed
and
it
seemed
to
be
parallel
with
madame
de
la
chanterie
s
bedroom
which
also
opened
into
the
salon
this
room
had
no
other
ornament
than
a
tall
clock
the
furniture
consisted
of
six
chairs
with
oval
backs
covered
with
done
probably
by
madame
de
la
chanterie
s
own
hand
two
buffets
and
a
table
all
of
mahogany
on
which
manon
did
not
lay
a
cloth
for
breakfast
the
breakfast
of
monastic
frugality
was
composed
of
a
small
turbot
with
a
white
sauce
potatoes
a
salad
and
four
dishes
of
fruit
peaches
grapes
strawberries
and
fresh
almonds
also
for
relishes
honey
in
the
comb
as
in
switzerland
radishes
cucumbers
sardines
and
butter
the
whole
served
in
the
china
with
tiny
blue
flowers
and
green
leaves
on
a
white
ground
which
was
no
doubt
a
luxury
in
the
days
of
louis
but
had
now
under
the
growing
demands
of
luxury
come
to
be
regarded
as
common
we
keep
the
fasts
said
monsieur
alain
as
we
go
to
mass
every
morning
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
find
us
blindly
following
all
the
customs
of
the
church
even
the
and
you
shall
begin
by
imitating
us
said
madame
de
la
chanterie
with
a
glance
at
godefroid
whom
she
had
placed
beside
her
of
the
five
persons
present
godefroid
knew
the
names
of
three
madame
de
la
chanterie
the
abbe
de
veze
and
monsieur
alain
he
wished
to
know
those
of
the
other
two
but
they
kept
silence
and
ate
their
food
with
the
attention
which
recluses
appear
to
give
to
every
detail
of
a
meal
does
this
fine
fruit
come
also
from
your
farm
madame
asked
godefroid
yes
monsieur
she
replied
we
have
a
little
model
farm
like
the
government
itself
we
call
it
our
country
house
it
is
twelve
miles
from
here
on
the
road
to
italy
near
it
is
a
property
that
belongs
to
us
all
and
is
to
go
to
the
survivor
said
the
goodman
alain
oh
it
is
not
very
considerable
added
madame
de
la
chanterie
rather
hastily
as
if
she
feared
that
godefroid
might
think
these
remarks
a
bait
there
are
thirty
acres
of
tilled
land
said
one
of
the
two
personages
still
unknown
to
godefroid
six
of
meadow
and
an
enclosure
containing
four
acres
in
which
our
house
which
adjoins
the
farmhouse
but
such
a
property
as
that
said
godefroid
must
be
worth
a
hundred
thousand
oh
we
don
t
get
anything
out
of
it
but
our
provisions
said
the
same
personage
he
was
a
tall
grave
spare
man
with
all
the
appearance
of
having
served
in
the
army
his
white
hair
showed
him
to
be
past
sixty
and
his
face
betrayed
some
violent
grief
controlled
by
religion
the
second
unnamed
person
who
seemed
to
be
something
between
a
master
of
rhetoric
and
a
business
agent
was
of
ordinary
height
plump
but
active
withal
his
face
had
the
jovial
expression
which
characterizes
those
of
lawyers
and
notaries
in
paris
the
dress
of
these
four
personages
revealed
a
neatness
due
to
the
most
scrupulous
personal
care
the
same
hand
and
it
was
that
of
manon
could
be
seen
in
every
detail
their
coats
were
perhaps
ten
years
old
but
they
were
preserved
like
the
coats
of
vicars
by
the
occult
power
of
the
and
the
constant
care
with
which
they
were
worn
these
men
seemed
to
wear
on
their
backs
the
livery
of
a
system
of
life
they
belonged
to
one
thought
their
looks
said
the
same
word
their
faces
breathed
a
gentle
resignation
a
provoking
quietude
is
it
an
indiscretion
madame
said
godefroid
to
ask
the
names
of
these
gentlemen
i
am
ready
to
explain
my
life
can
i
know
as
much
of
theirs
as
custom
will
allow
that
gentleman
said
madame
de
la
chanterie
motioning
to
the
tall
thin
man
is
monsieur
nicolas
he
is
a
colonel
of
gendarmerie
retired
with
the
rank
of
and
this
she
added
looking
towards
the
stout
little
man
is
a
former
councillor
of
the
royal
courts
of
paris
who
retired
from
the
magistracy
in
his
name
is
monsieur
joseph
though
you
have
only
been
with
us
one
day
i
will
tell
you
that
in
the
world
monsieur
nicolas
once
bore
the
name
of
the
marquis
de
montauran
and
monsieur
joseph
that
of
lecamus
baron
de
tresnes
but
for
us
as
for
the
world
those
names
no
longer
exist
these
gentlemen
are
without
heirs
they
only
advance
by
a
little
the
oblivion
which
awaits
their
names
they
are
simply
monsieur
nicolas
and
monsieur
joseph
as
you
will
be
monsieur
as
he
heard
those
names
one
so
celebrated
in
the
annals
of
royalism
by
the
catastrophe
which
put
an
end
to
the
uprising
of
the
chouans
the
other
so
revered
in
the
halls
of
the
old
parliament
of
paris
godefroid
could
not
repress
a
quiver
he
looked
at
these
relics
of
the
grandest
things
of
the
fallen
monarchy
the
and
the
law
and
he
could
see
no
movement
of
the
features
no
change
in
the
countenance
that
revealed
the
presence
of
a
worldly
thought
those
men
no
longer
remembered
or
did
not
choose
to
remember
what
they
had
been
this
was
godefroid
s
first
lesson
each
of
your
names
gentlemen
is
a
whole
history
in
itself
he
said
respectfully
yes
the
history
of
my
time
ruins
replied
monsieur
joseph
you
are
in
good
company
said
monsieur
alain
the
latter
can
be
described
in
a
word
he
was
the
small
bourgeois
of
paris
the
worthy
being
with
a
kindly
face
relieved
by
pure
white
hair
but
made
insipid
by
an
eternal
smile
as
for
the
priest
the
abbe
de
veze
his
presence
said
all
the
priest
who
fulfils
his
mission
is
known
by
the
first
glance
he
gives
you
and
by
the
glance
that
others
who
know
him
give
to
him
that
which
struck
godefroid
most
forcibly
at
first
was
the
profound
respect
which
the
four
lodgers
manifested
for
madame
de
la
chanterie
they
all
seemed
even
the
priest
in
spite
of
the
sacred
character
his
functions
gave
him
to
regard
her
as
a
queen
godefroid
also
noticed
their
sobriety
each
seemed
to
eat
only
for
nourishment
madame
de
la
chanterie
took
as
did
the
rest
a
single
peach
and
half
a
bunch
of
grapes
but
she
told
her
new
lodger
as
she
offered
him
the
various
dishes
not
to
imitate
such
temperance
godefroid
s
curiosity
was
excited
to
the
highest
degree
by
this
first
entrance
on
his
new
life
when
they
returned
to
the
salon
after
breakfast
he
was
left
alone
madame
de
la
chanterie
retired
to
the
embrasure
of
a
window
and
held
a
little
private
council
with
her
four
friends
this
conference
entirely
devoid
of
animation
lasted
half
an
hour
they
spoke
together
in
a
low
voice
exchanging
words
which
each
of
them
appeared
to
have
thought
over
from
time
to
time
monsieur
alain
and
monsieur
joseph
consulted
a
turning
over
its
leaves
see
the
faubourg
said
madame
de
la
chanterie
to
monsieur
joseph
who
left
the
house
that
was
the
only
word
godefroid
distinguished
and
you
the
quarter
she
continued
addressing
monsieur
nicolas
hunt
through
the
faubourg
and
see
if
you
can
find
what
we
want
this
to
the
abbe
de
veze
who
went
away
immediately
and
you
my
dear
alain
she
added
smiling
at
the
latter
make
an
examination
there
those
important
matters
are
all
settled
she
said
returning
to
godefroid
she
seated
herself
in
her
armchair
took
a
little
piece
of
linen
from
the
table
before
her
and
began
to
sew
as
if
she
were
employed
to
do
so
godefroid
lost
in
conjecture
and
still
thinking
of
a
royalist
conspiracy
took
his
landlady
s
remark
as
an
opening
and
he
began
to
study
her
as
he
seated
himself
beside
her
he
was
struck
by
the
singular
dexterity
with
which
she
worked
although
everything
about
her
bespoke
the
great
lady
she
showed
the
dexterity
of
a
workwoman
for
every
one
can
see
at
a
glance
by
certain
manipulations
the
work
of
a
workman
or
an
amateur
you
do
that
said
godefroid
as
if
you
knew
the
alas
she
answered
without
raising
her
head
i
did
know
it
once
out
of
two
large
tears
came
into
her
eyes
and
rolled
down
her
cheeks
to
the
linen
in
her
hand
forgive
me
madame
cried
godefroid
madame
de
chanterie
looked
at
her
new
lodger
and
saw
such
an
expression
of
genuine
regret
upon
his
face
that
she
made
him
a
friendly
sign
after
drying
her
eyes
she
immediately
recovered
the
calmness
that
characterized
her
face
which
was
less
cold
than
chastened
you
are
here
monsieur
godefroid
for
you
know
already
that
we
shall
call
you
by
your
baptized
name
you
are
here
in
the
midst
of
ruins
caused
by
a
great
tempest
we
have
each
been
struck
and
wounded
in
our
hearts
our
family
interests
or
our
fortunes
by
that
whirlwind
of
forty
years
which
overthrew
religion
and
royalty
and
dispersed
the
elements
of
all
that
made
old
france
words
that
seem
quite
harmless
do
sometimes
wound
us
all
and
that
is
why
we
are
so
silent
we
speak
rarely
of
ourselves
we
forget
ourselves
and
we
have
found
a
way
to
substitute
another
life
for
our
lives
it
is
because
after
hearing
your
confidence
at
monsieur
mongenod
s
i
thought
there
seemed
a
likeness
between
your
situation
and
ours
that
i
induced
my
four
friends
to
receive
you
among
us
besides
we
wanted
another
monk
in
our
convent
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
no
one
can
face
solitude
without
some
moral
madame
i
should
be
very
glad
after
hearing
what
you
have
said
if
you
yourself
would
be
the
guide
of
my
you
speak
like
a
man
of
the
world
she
answered
and
are
trying
to
flatter
me
a
woman
of
sixty
my
dear
child
she
went
on
let
me
tell
you
that
you
are
here
among
persons
who
believe
strongly
in
god
who
have
all
felt
his
hand
and
have
yielded
themselves
to
him
almost
as
though
they
were
trappists
have
you
ever
remarked
the
profound
sense
of
safety
in
a
true
priest
when
he
has
given
himself
to
the
lord
when
he
listens
to
his
voice
and
strives
to
make
himself
a
docile
instrument
in
the
hand
of
providence
he
has
no
longer
vanity
or
nothing
of
all
that
which
wounds
continually
the
hearts
of
the
world
his
quietude
is
equal
to
that
of
the
fatalist
his
resignation
does
truly
enable
him
to
bear
all
the
true
priest
such
a
one
as
the
abbe
de
veze
lives
like
a
child
with
its
mother
for
the
church
my
dear
monsieur
godefroid
is
a
good
mother
well
a
man
can
be
a
priest
without
the
tonsure
all
priests
are
not
in
orders
to
vow
one
s
self
to
good
that
is
imitating
a
true
priest
it
is
obedience
to
god
i
am
not
preaching
to
you
i
am
not
trying
to
convert
you
i
am
explaining
our
lives
to
instruct
me
madame
said
godefroid
deeply
impressed
so
that
i
may
not
fail
in
any
of
your
that
would
be
hard
upon
you
you
will
learn
them
by
degrees
never
speak
here
of
your
misfortunes
they
are
slight
compared
to
the
catastrophes
by
which
the
lives
of
those
you
are
now
among
were
while
speaking
thus
madame
de
la
chanterie
drew
her
needle
and
set
her
stitches
with
unbroken
regularity
but
here
she
paused
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
godefroid
she
saw
him
charmed
by
the
penetrating
sweetness
of
her
voice
which
possessed
let
us
say
it
here
an
apostolic
unction
the
sick
soul
contemplated
with
admiration
the
truly
extraordinary
phenomenon
presented
by
this
woman
whose
face
was
now
resplendent
rosy
tints
were
spreading
on
the
waxen
cheeks
her
eyes
shone
the
youthfulness
of
her
soul
changed
the
light
wrinkles
into
gracious
lines
and
all
about
her
solicited
affection
godefroid
in
that
one
moment
measured
the
gulf
that
separated
this
woman
from
common
sentiments
he
saw
her
inaccessible
on
a
peak
to
which
religion
had
led
her
and
he
was
still
too
worldly
not
to
be
keenly
piqued
and
to
long
to
plunge
through
the
gulf
and
up
to
the
summit
on
which
she
stood
and
stand
beside
her
giving
himself
up
to
this
desire
he
related
to
her
all
the
mistakes
of
his
life
and
much
that
he
could
not
tell
at
mongenod
s
where
his
confidences
had
been
confined
to
his
actual
situation
poor
child
that
exclamation
falling
now
and
then
from
madame
de
la
chanterie
s
lips
as
he
went
on
dropped
like
balm
upon
the
heart
of
the
sufferer
what
can
i
substitute
for
so
many
hopes
betrayed
so
much
affection
wasted
he
asked
looking
at
his
hostess
who
had
now
grown
thoughtful
i
came
here
he
resumed
to
reflect
and
choose
a
course
of
action
i
have
lost
my
mother
will
you
replace
her
will
you
she
said
show
a
son
s
obedience
yes
if
you
will
have
the
tenderness
that
commands
i
will
try
she
said
godefroid
put
out
his
hand
to
take
that
of
his
hostess
who
gave
it
to
him
guessing
his
intentions
he
carried
it
respectfully
to
his
lips
madame
de
la
chanterie
s
hand
was
exquisitely
beautiful
without
a
wrinkle
neither
fat
nor
thin
white
enough
to
be
the
envy
of
all
young
women
and
shapely
enough
for
the
model
of
a
sculptor
godefroid
had
already
admired
those
hands
conscious
of
their
harmony
with
the
spell
of
her
voice
and
the
celestial
blue
of
her
glance
wait
a
moment
said
madame
de
la
chanterie
rising
and
going
into
her
own
room
godefroid
was
keenly
excited
he
did
not
know
to
what
class
of
ideas
her
movement
was
to
be
attributed
his
perplexity
did
not
last
long
for
she
presently
returned
with
a
book
in
her
hand
here
my
dear
child
she
said
are
the
prescriptions
of
a
great
physician
of
souls
when
the
things
of
ordinary
life
have
not
given
us
the
happiness
we
expected
of
them
we
must
seek
for
happiness
in
a
higher
life
here
is
the
key
of
a
new
world
read
night
and
morning
a
chapter
of
this
book
but
bring
your
full
attention
to
bear
upon
what
you
read
study
the
words
as
you
would
a
foreign
language
at
the
end
of
a
month
you
will
be
another
man
it
is
now
twenty
years
that
i
have
read
a
chapter
every
day
and
my
three
friends
messieurs
nicolas
alain
and
joseph
would
no
more
fail
in
that
practice
than
they
would
fail
in
getting
up
and
going
to
bed
do
as
they
do
for
love
of
god
for
love
of
me
she
said
with
a
divine
serenity
an
august
confidence
godefroid
turned
over
the
book
and
read
upon
its
back
in
gilt
letters
imitation
of
jesus
christ
the
simplicity
of
this
old
woman
her
youthful
candor
her
certainty
of
doing
a
good
deed
confounded
the
madame
de
la
chanterie
s
face
wore
a
rapturous
expression
and
her
attitude
was
that
of
a
woman
who
was
offering
a
hundred
thousand
francs
to
a
merchant
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
i
have
used
that
volume
she
said
for
years
god
grant
its
touch
may
be
contagious
go
now
and
buy
me
another
copy
for
this
is
the
hour
when
persons
come
here
who
must
not
be
godefroid
bowed
and
went
to
his
room
where
he
flung
the
book
upon
the
table
exclaiming
poor
good
woman
well
so
be
it
the
influence
of
books
the
book
like
all
books
frequently
read
opened
in
a
particular
place
godefroid
sat
down
as
if
to
put
his
ideas
in
order
for
he
had
gone
through
more
emotion
during
this
one
morning
than
he
had
often
done
in
the
agitated
months
of
his
life
but
above
all
his
curiosity
was
keenly
excited
letting
his
eyes
fall
by
chance
as
people
will
when
their
souls
are
launched
in
meditation
they
rested
mechanically
on
the
two
open
pages
of
the
book
almost
unconsciously
he
read
the
following
heading
chapter
xii
the
royal
way
of
the
holy
cross
he
took
up
the
book
a
sentence
of
that
noble
chapter
caught
his
eye
like
a
flash
of
light
he
has
walked
before
thee
bearing
his
cross
he
died
for
thee
that
thou
mightest
bear
thy
cross
and
be
glad
to
die
upon
it
go
where
thou
wilt
seek
what
thou
wilt
never
canst
thou
find
a
nobler
surer
path
than
the
royal
way
of
the
holy
cross
dispose
and
order
all
things
according
to
thy
desires
and
thine
own
judgment
and
still
thou
shalt
find
trials
to
suffer
whether
thou
wilt
or
no
and
so
the
cross
is
there
be
it
pain
of
body
or
pain
of
mind
sometimes
god
will
seem
to
leave
thee
sometimes
men
will
harass
thee
but
far
worse
thou
wilt
find
thyself
a
burden
to
thyself
and
no
remedy
will
deliver
thee
no
consolation
comfort
thee
until
it
pleases
god
to
end
thy
trouble
thou
must
bear
it
for
it
is
god
s
will
that
we
suffer
without
consolation
that
we
may
go
to
him
without
one
backward
look
humble
through
what
a
strange
book
thought
godefroid
turning
over
the
leaves
then
his
eyes
lighted
on
the
following
words
when
thou
hast
reached
the
height
of
finding
all
afflictions
sweet
since
they
have
made
thee
love
the
love
of
jesus
christ
then
know
thyself
happy
for
thou
hast
found
thy
paradise
in
this
annoyed
by
this
simplicity
the
characteristic
of
strength
angry
at
being
foiled
by
a
book
he
closed
the
volume
but
even
then
he
saw
in
letters
of
gold
on
the
green
morocco
cover
the
words
seek
that
which
is
eternal
and
that
only
have
they
found
it
here
he
asked
himself
he
went
out
to
buy
the
handsomest
copy
he
could
find
of
the
imitation
of
jesus
christ
thinking
that
madame
de
la
chanterie
would
wish
to
read
her
chapter
that
night
when
he
reached
the
street
he
stood
a
moment
near
the
door
uncertain
which
way
to
take
and
debating
in
what
direction
he
was
likely
to
find
a
bookseller
as
he
stood
there
he
heard
the
heavy
sound
of
the
massive
closing
two
men
were
leaving
the
hotel
de
la
chanterie
if
the
reader
has
fully
understood
the
character
of
this
old
house
he
will
know
that
it
was
one
of
the
ancient
mansions
of
the
olden
time
manon
herself
when
she
called
godefroid
that
morning
had
asked
him
smiling
how
he
had
slept
in
the
hotel
de
la
chanterie
godefroid
followed
the
two
men
without
the
slightest
intention
of
watching
them
they
took
him
for
an
accidental
passer
and
spoke
in
tones
which
enabled
him
to
hear
distinctly
in
those
lonely
streets
the
two
men
passed
along
the
rue
massillon
beside
the
church
and
crossed
the
open
space
in
front
of
it
well
you
see
old
man
it
is
easy
enough
to
catch
their
sous
say
what
they
want
you
to
say
that
s
but
we
owe
to
whom
to
that
lady
i
d
like
to
see
that
old
body
try
to
get
it
i
d
you
d
pay
well
you
re
right
for
if
i
paid
her
i
d
get
more
another
wouldn
t
it
be
better
to
do
as
they
advise
and
build
up
a
good
business
pooh
but
she
said
she
would
get
some
one
to
lend
us
the
then
we
should
have
to
give
up
the
life
of
well
i
d
rather
i
m
sick
of
it
it
isn
t
being
a
man
at
all
to
be
drunk
half
one
s
yes
but
you
know
the
abbe
turned
his
back
on
old
marin
the
other
day
he
refused
him
because
old
marin
tried
to
swindle
and
nobody
can
succeed
in
that
but
just
then
the
two
men
whose
dress
seemed
to
show
that
they
were
foremen
in
some
workshop
turned
abruptly
round
towards
the
place
maubert
by
the
bridge
of
the
godefroid
stepped
aside
to
let
them
pass
seeing
him
so
close
behind
them
they
looked
rather
anxiously
at
each
other
and
their
faces
expressed
a
regret
for
having
spoken
godefroid
was
the
more
interested
by
this
conversation
because
it
reminded
him
of
the
scene
between
the
abbe
de
veze
and
the
workman
the
day
of
his
first
visit
thinking
over
this
circumstance
he
went
as
far
as
a
bookseller
s
in
the
rue
whence
he
returned
with
a
very
handsome
copy
of
the
finest
edition
published
in
france
of
the
imitation
of
jesus
walking
slowly
back
in
order
that
he
might
arrive
exactly
at
the
dinner
hour
he
recalled
his
own
sensations
during
this
morning
and
he
was
conscious
of
a
new
impulse
in
his
soul
he
was
seized
by
a
sudden
and
deep
curiosity
but
his
curiosity
paled
before
an
inexplicable
desire
he
was
drawn
to
madame
de
la
chanterie
he
felt
the
keenest
desire
to
attach
himself
to
her
to
devote
himself
to
her
to
please
her
to
deserve
her
praise
in
short
he
felt
the
first
emotions
of
platonic
love
he
saw
glimpses
of
the
untold
grandeur
of
that
soul
and
he
longed
to
know
it
in
its
entirety
he
grew
impatient
to
enter
the
inner
lives
of
these
pure
catholics
in
that
small
company
of
faithful
souls
the
majesty
of
practical
religion
was
so
thoroughly
blended
with
all
that
is
most
majestic
in
a
french
woman
that
godefroid
resolved
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
make
himself
accepted
as
a
true
member
of
the
little
body
these
feelings
would
have
been
unnaturally
sudden
in
a
busy
parisian
eagerly
occupied
with
life
but
godefroid
was
as
we
have
seen
in
the
position
of
a
drowning
man
who
catches
at
every
floating
branch
thinking
it
a
solid
stay
and
his
soul
ploughed
and
furrowed
with
trial
was
ready
to
receive
all
seed
he
found
the
four
friends
in
the
salon
and
he
presented
the
book
to
madame
de
la
chanterie
saying
i
did
not
like
to
deprive
you
of
it
god
grant
she
said
smiling
as
she
looked
at
the
magnificent
volume
that
this
may
be
your
last
excess
of
looking
at
the
clothes
of
the
four
men
present
and
observing
how
in
every
particular
they
were
reduced
to
mere
utility
and
neatness
and
seeing
too
how
rigorously
the
same
principle
was
applied
to
all
the
details
of
the
house
godefroid
understood
the
value
of
the
reproach
so
courteously
made
to
him
madame
he
said
the
persons
whom
you
obliged
this
morning
are
scoundrels
i
overheard
without
intending
it
what
they
said
to
each
other
when
they
left
the
house
it
was
full
of
the
basest
they
were
the
two
locksmiths
of
the
rue
mouffetard
said
madame
de
la
chanterie
to
monsieur
nicolas
that
is
your
the
fish
gets
away
more
than
once
before
it
is
caught
said
monsieur
alain
laughing
the
perfect
indifference
of
madame
de
la
chanterie
on
hearing
of
the
immediate
ingratitude
of
persons
to
whom
she
had
no
doubt
given
money
surprised
godefroid
who
became
thoughtful
the
dinner
was
enlivened
by
monsieur
alain
and
monsieur
joseph
but
monsieur
nicolas
remained
quiet
sad
and
cold
he
bore
on
his
features
the
ineffaceable
imprint
of
some
bitter
grief
some
eternal
sorrow
madame
de
la
chanterie
paid
equal
attentions
to
all
godefroid
felt
himself
observed
by
these
persons
whose
prudence
equalled
their
piety
his
vanity
led
him
to
imitate
their
reserve
and
he
measured
his
words
this
first
day
was
much
more
interesting
than
those
which
succeeded
it
godefroid
who
found
himself
set
aside
from
all
the
serious
conferences
was
obliged
during
several
hours
in
mornings
and
evenings
when
he
was
left
wholly
to
himself
to
have
recourse
to
the
imitation
of
jesus
christ
and
he
ended
by
studying
that
book
as
a
man
studies
a
book
when
he
has
but
one
or
is
a
prisoner
a
book
is
then
like
a
woman
with
whom
we
live
in
solitude
we
must
either
hate
or
adore
that
woman
and
in
like
manner
we
must
either
enter
into
the
soul
of
the
author
or
not
read
ten
lines
of
his
book
now
it
is
impossible
not
to
be
impressed
by
the
imitation
of
jesus
christ
which
is
to
dogma
what
action
is
to
thought
catholicism
vibrates
in
it
pulses
breathes
and
lives
body
to
body
with
human
life
the
book
is
a
sure
friend
it
speaks
to
all
passions
all
difficulties
even
worldly
ones
it
solves
all
problems
it
is
more
eloquent
than
any
preacher
for
its
voice
is
your
own
it
is
the
voice
within
your
soul
you
hear
it
with
your
spirit
it
is
in
short
the
gospel
translated
adapted
to
all
ages
the
summit
and
crest
of
all
human
situations
it
is
extraordinary
that
the
church
has
never
canonized
john
gersen
for
the
divine
spirit
evidently
inspired
his
pen
for
godefroid
the
hotel
de
la
chanterie
now
held
a
woman
and
a
book
day
by
day
he
loved
the
woman
more
he
discovered
flowers
buried
beneath
the
snows
of
winter
in
her
heart
he
had
glimpses
of
the
joys
of
a
sacred
friendship
which
religion
permits
on
which
the
angels
smile
a
friendship
which
here
united
these
five
persons
and
against
which
no
evil
could
prevail
this
is
a
sentiment
higher
than
all
others
a
love
of
soul
to
soul
resembling
those
rarest
flowers
born
on
the
highest
peaks
of
earth
a
love
of
which
a
few
examples
are
offered
to
humanity
from
age
to
age
by
which
lovers
are
sometimes
bound
together
in
one
being
and
which
explains
those
faithful
attachments
which
are
otherwise
inexplicable
by
the
laws
of
the
world
it
is
a
bond
without
disappointment
without
misunderstanding
without
vanity
without
strife
without
even
contradictions
so
completely
are
the
moral
natures
blended
into
one
this
sentiment
vast
infinite
born
of
catholic
charity
godefroid
foresaw
with
all
its
joys
at
times
he
could
not
believe
the
spectacle
before
his
eyes
and
he
sought
for
reasons
to
explain
the
sublime
friendship
of
these
five
persons
wondering
in
his
heart
to
find
true
catholics
true
christians
of
the
early
church
in
the
paris
of
vi
the
business
of
the
house
of
chanterie
and
company
within
a
week
after
his
arrival
godefroid
had
seen
such
a
concourse
of
persons
he
had
overheard
fragments
of
conversation
relating
to
so
many
serious
topics
that
he
began
to
perceive
an
enormous
activity
in
the
lives
of
the
five
inmates
of
the
house
he
noticed
that
none
of
them
slept
more
than
five
hours
at
the
most
they
had
all
made
in
some
sort
a
first
day
before
the
second
breakfast
during
that
time
strangers
came
and
went
bringing
or
carrying
away
money
sometimes
in
considerable
sums
a
messenger
from
the
mongenod
often
came
always
very
early
in
the
morning
so
that
his
errand
might
not
interfere
with
the
business
of
the
bank
one
evening
monsieur
mongenod
came
himself
and
godefroid
noticed
that
he
showed
to
monsieur
alain
a
certain
filial
familiarity
added
to
the
profound
respect
which
he
testified
to
the
three
other
lodgers
of
madame
de
la
chanterie
on
that
evening
the
banker
merely
put
a
few
questions
to
godefroid
was
he
comfortable
did
he
intend
to
stay
at
the
same
time
advising
him
to
persevere
in
his
plan
i
need
only
one
thing
to
make
me
contented
said
godefroid
what
is
that
asked
the
banker
an
an
occupation
remarked
the
abbe
de
veze
then
you
have
changed
your
mind
i
thought
you
came
to
our
cloister
for
rest
without
the
prayers
that
enlivened
monasteries
without
the
meditation
which
peopled
the
thebaids
becomes
a
disease
said
monsieur
joseph
sententiously
learn
said
monsieur
mongenod
with
a
smile
you
might
become
in
a
few
months
very
useful
to
my
friends
oh
with
pleasure
cried
godefroid
the
next
day
was
sunday
madame
de
la
chanterie
requested
him
to
give
her
his
arm
to
high
mass
it
is
she
said
the
only
coercion
i
shall
put
upon
you
several
times
during
the
past
week
i
have
wished
to
speak
to
you
of
religion
but
it
did
not
seem
to
me
that
the
time
had
come
you
would
find
plenty
of
occupation
if
you
shared
our
beliefs
for
then
you
would
share
our
labors
as
during
mass
godefroid
noticed
the
fervor
of
messieurs
nicolas
joseph
and
alain
and
as
during
the
last
few
days
he
had
also
noticed
their
superiority
and
intelligence
and
the
vast
extent
of
their
knowledge
he
concluded
when
he
saw
how
they
humbled
themselves
that
the
catholic
religion
had
secrets
which
had
hitherto
escaped
him
after
all
he
said
to
himself
it
is
the
religion
of
bossuet
pascal
racine
louis
raffaelle
ximenes
bayard
du
guesclin
and
how
could
i
weakling
that
i
am
compare
myself
to
those
intellects
those
statesmen
those
poets
those
heroes
if
there
were
not
some
real
instruction
in
these
minor
details
it
would
be
imprudent
to
dwell
upon
them
in
these
days
but
they
are
indispensable
to
the
interests
of
this
history
in
which
the
present
public
will
be
none
too
ready
to
believe
and
which
presents
at
the
outset
a
fact
that
is
almost
ridiculous
namely
the
empire
which
a
woman
of
sixty
obtained
over
a
young
man
disappointed
with
the
world
you
did
not
pray
at
all
said
madame
de
la
chanterie
to
godefroid
as
they
left
the
portal
of
not
for
any
one
not
even
for
the
soul
of
your
godefroid
colored
and
said
nothing
will
you
do
me
the
favor
continued
madame
de
la
chanterie
to
go
to
your
room
and
not
come
into
the
salon
for
an
hour
you
can
meditate
if
you
love
me
on
the
first
chapter
in
the
third
book
of
the
imitation
the
one
entitled
of
inward
godefroid
bowed
stiffly
and
went
to
his
room
the
devil
take
them
he
exclaimed
to
himself
giving
way
to
downright
anger
what
do
they
want
with
me
here
what
is
all
this
traffic
they
are
carrying
on
pooh
all
women
even
pious
ones
are
up
to
the
same
tricks
if
madame
giving
her
the
name
by
which
her
lodgers
spoke
of
her
wants
me
out
of
the
way
it
is
probably
because
they
are
plotting
something
against
with
that
thought
in
his
mind
he
tried
to
look
from
his
window
into
that
of
the
salon
but
the
situation
of
the
rooms
did
not
allow
it
he
went
down
one
flight
and
then
returned
reflecting
that
according
to
the
rigid
principles
of
the
house
he
should
be
dismissed
if
discovered
spying
to
lose
the
respect
of
those
five
persons
seemed
to
him
as
serious
as
public
dishonor
he
waited
three
quarters
of
an
hour
then
he
resolved
to
surprise
madame
de
la
chanterie
and
come
upon
her
suddenly
before
she
expected
him
he
invented
a
lie
to
excuse
himself
saying
that
his
watch
was
wrong
for
which
purpose
he
set
it
on
twenty
minutes
then
he
went
downstairs
making
no
noise
reached
the
door
of
the
salon
and
opened
it
abruptly
he
saw
a
man
still
young
but
already
celebrated
a
poet
whom
he
had
frequently
met
in
society
victor
de
vernisset
on
his
knees
before
madame
de
la
chanterie
and
kissing
the
hem
of
her
dress
if
the
sky
had
fallen
and
shivered
to
atoms
like
glass
as
the
ancients
thought
it
was
godefroid
could
not
have
been
more
astonished
shocking
thoughts
came
into
his
mind
and
then
a
reaction
more
terrible
still
when
before
the
sarcasm
he
was
about
to
utter
had
left
his
lips
he
saw
monsieur
alain
in
a
corner
of
the
room
counting
out
in
an
instant
vernisset
was
on
his
feet
and
the
worthy
alain
looked
thunderstruck
madame
de
la
chanterie
on
her
part
gave
godefroid
a
look
which
petrified
him
for
the
twofold
expression
on
the
face
of
the
visitor
had
not
escaped
him
monsieur
is
one
of
us
she
said
to
the
young
poet
with
a
sign
towards
godefroid
then
you
are
a
happy
man
my
dear
fellow
said
vernisset
you
are
saved
but
madame
he
added
turning
to
madame
de
la
chanterie
if
all
paris
had
seen
me
i
should
rejoice
in
it
nothing
can
ever
mark
my
gratitude
to
you
i
am
yours
forever
i
belong
to
you
utterly
command
me
as
you
will
and
i
obey
i
owe
you
my
life
and
it
is
well
well
young
man
said
the
kind
alain
then
be
wise
be
virtuous
only
but
do
not
attack
religion
in
your
books
moreover
remember
that
you
owe
a
and
he
handed
him
an
envelope
thick
with
the
he
had
counted
out
the
tears
were
in
victor
de
vernisset
s
eyes
he
kissed
madame
de
la
chanterie
s
hand
respectfully
and
went
away
after
shaking
hands
with
monsieur
alain
and
godefroid
you
have
not
obeyed
madame
said
the
goodman
alain
solemnly
with
a
sad
expression
on
his
face
that
godefroid
had
never
before
seen
there
and
that
is
a
great
wrong
if
it
happens
again
we
must
part
this
may
seem
hard
to
you
after
we
had
begun
to
give
you
our
my
dear
alain
said
madame
de
la
chanterie
have
the
kindness
for
my
sake
to
say
no
more
about
this
piece
of
thoughtlessness
we
ought
not
to
ask
too
much
a
new
arrival
who
has
been
spared
great
misfortunes
and
knows
nothing
of
religion
and
who
moreover
has
only
an
excessive
curiosity
about
our
vocation
and
does
not
yet
believe
in
forgive
me
madame
said
godefroid
i
do
desire
from
this
time
forth
to
be
worthy
of
you
i
will
submit
to
any
trial
you
think
necessary
before
initiating
me
into
the
secrets
of
your
work
and
if
the
abbe
de
veze
will
undertake
to
instruct
me
i
will
listen
to
him
soul
and
these
words
made
madame
de
la
chanterie
so
happy
that
a
faint
color
stole
upon
her
cheeks
she
took
godefroid
s
hand
and
pressed
it
then
she
said
with
strange
emotion
it
is
that
evening
after
dinner
visitors
came
in
a
of
the
diocese
of
paris
two
canons
two
former
mayors
of
paris
and
one
of
the
ladies
who
distributed
the
charities
of
no
cards
were
played
but
the
conversation
was
gay
without
being
vapid
a
visit
which
surprised
godefroid
greatly
was
that
of
the
comtesse
de
one
of
the
highest
personages
in
aristocratic
society
whose
salon
was
inaccessible
to
the
bourgeoisie
and
to
parvenus
the
presence
of
this
great
lady
in
madame
de
la
chanterie
s
salon
was
sufficiently
surprising
but
the
manner
in
which
the
two
women
met
and
treated
each
other
seemed
to
godefroid
inexplicable
for
it
showed
the
closest
intimacy
and
a
constant
intercourse
which
gave
madame
de
la
chanterie
an
added
value
in
his
eyes
madame
de
was
gracious
and
affectionate
in
manner
to
the
four
friends
of
her
friend
and
showed
the
utmost
respect
to
monsieur
nicolas
we
may
see
here
how
social
vanities
still
governed
godefroid
for
up
to
this
visit
of
madame
de
he
was
still
undecided
but
he
now
resolved
to
give
himself
up
with
or
without
conviction
to
whatever
madame
de
la
chanterie
and
her
friends
might
exact
of
him
in
order
to
get
affiliated
with
their
order
and
initiated
into
their
secrets
assuring
himself
that
in
that
way
he
should
find
a
career
the
next
day
he
went
to
a
whom
madame
de
la
chanterie
recommended
and
arranged
with
him
the
hours
at
which
they
should
work
together
his
whole
time
was
now
employed
the
abbe
de
veze
instructed
him
in
the
mornings
he
was
two
hours
a
day
with
the
and
he
spent
the
rest
of
his
time
between
breakfast
and
dinner
in
doing
imaginary
commercial
accounts
which
his
master
required
him
to
write
at
home
some
time
passed
thus
during
which
godefroid
felt
the
charm
of
a
life
in
which
each
hour
has
its
own
employment
the
recurrence
of
a
settled
work
at
settled
moments
regularity
of
action
is
the
secret
of
many
a
happy
life
and
it
proves
how
deeply
the
founders
of
religious
orders
had
meditated
on
the
nature
of
man
godefroid
who
had
made
up
his
mind
to
listen
to
the
abbe
de
veze
began
to
have
serious
thoughts
of
a
future
life
and
to
find
how
little
he
knew
of
the
real
gravity
of
religious
questions
moreover
from
day
to
day
madame
de
la
chanterie
with
whom
he
always
remained
for
an
hour
after
the
second
breakfast
allowed
him
to
discover
the
treasures
that
were
in
her
he
knew
then
that
he
never
could
have
imagined
a
so
broad
and
so
complete
a
woman
of
madame
de
la
chanterie
s
apparent
age
no
longer
has
the
pettiness
of
younger
women
she
is
a
friend
who
offers
you
all
feminine
refinements
who
displays
the
graces
the
choice
attractions
which
nature
inspires
in
a
woman
for
man
she
gives
them
and
no
longer
sells
them
such
a
woman
is
either
detestable
or
perfect
for
her
gifts
are
either
not
of
the
flesh
or
they
are
worthless
madame
de
la
chanterie
was
perfect
she
seemed
never
to
have
had
a
youth
her
glance
never
told
of
a
past
godefroid
s
curiosity
was
far
from
being
appeased
by
a
closer
and
more
intimate
knowledge
of
this
sublime
nature
the
discoveries
of
each
succeeding
day
only
redoubled
his
desire
to
learn
the
anterior
life
of
a
woman
whom
he
now
thought
a
saint
had
she
ever
loved
had
she
been
a
wife
a
mother
nothing
about
her
was
characteristic
of
an
old
maid
she
displayed
all
the
graces
of
a
woman
and
an
observer
would
perceive
in
her
robust
health
in
the
extraordinary
phenomena
of
her
physical
preservation
a
divine
life
and
a
species
of
ignorance
of
the
earthly
existence
except
the
gay
and
cheery
goodman
alain
all
these
persons
had
suffered
but
monsieur
nicolas
himself
seemed
to
give
the
palm
of
martyrdom
to
madame
de
la
chanterie
nevertheless
the
memory
of
her
sorrows
was
so
restrained
by
religious
resignation
by
her
secret
avocations
that
she
seemed
to
have
been
always
happy
you
are
the
life
of
your
friends
godefroid
said
to
her
one
day
you
are
the
tie
that
unites
them
the
as
it
were
of
some
great
work
and
as
we
are
all
mortal
i
ask
myself
sometimes
what
your
association
would
become
without
that
is
what
frightens
the
others
but
providence
to
whom
we
owe
our
new
she
said
smiling
will
provide
besides
i
am
on
the
will
your
new
soon
be
allowed
to
work
at
your
business
asked
godefroid
that
depends
on
himself
she
answered
smiling
he
must
be
sincerely
religious
truly
pious
without
the
least
not
concerned
about
the
riches
of
our
house
able
to
rise
above
all
petty
social
considerations
on
the
two
wings
which
god
has
given
what
are
they
singleness
of
mind
and
purity
replied
madame
de
la
chanterie
your
ignorance
shows
that
you
have
neglected
the
reading
of
our
she
added
laughing
at
the
innocent
trick
she
had
played
to
know
if
godefroid
had
read
the
imitation
of
jesus
and
lastly
she
went
on
fill
your
soul
with
saint
paul
s
epistle
upon
charity
when
that
is
done
she
added
with
a
sublime
look
it
will
not
be
you
who
belong
to
us
we
shall
belong
to
you
and
you
will
be
able
to
count
up
greater
riches
than
the
sovereigns
of
this
world
possess
you
will
enjoy
as
we
enjoy
yes
let
me
tell
you
if
you
remember
the
arabian
nights
that
the
treasures
of
aladdin
are
nothing
to
those
we
possess
and
so
for
the
last
year
we
have
not
sufficed
for
our
affairs
and
we
needed
as
you
see
a
while
speaking
she
studied
godefroid
s
face
he
on
his
part
did
not
know
how
to
take
this
extraordinary
confidence
but
as
the
scene
in
the
at
mongenod
s
came
often
to
his
mind
he
hovered
between
doubt
and
belief
ah
you
will
be
very
happy
she
said
godefroid
was
so
consumed
with
curiosity
that
from
this
moment
he
determined
to
break
through
the
reserve
of
one
of
the
four
friends
and
question
him
now
the
one
to
whom
he
felt
the
most
drawn
and
who
seemed
naturally
to
excite
the
sympathies
of
all
classes
was
the
kind
gay
simple
monsieur
alain
by
what
strange
path
could
providence
have
led
a
being
so
guileless
into
this
monastery
without
a
lock
where
recluses
of
both
sexes
lived
beneath
a
rule
in
the
midst
of
paris
in
absolute
freedom
as
though
they
were
guarded
by
the
sternest
of
superiors
what
drama
what
event
had
made
him
leave
his
own
road
in
life
and
take
this
path
among
the
sorrows
of
the
great
city
godefroid
resolved
to
ask
vii
monsieur
alain
tells
his
secrets
one
evening
godefroid
determined
to
pay
a
visit
to
his
neighbor
on
the
floor
above
him
with
the
intention
of
satisfying
a
curiosity
more
excited
by
the
apparent
impossibility
of
a
catastrophe
in
such
an
existence
than
it
would
have
been
under
the
expectation
of
discovering
some
terrible
episode
in
the
life
of
a
corsair
at
the
words
come
in
given
in
answer
to
two
raps
struck
discreetly
on
the
door
godefroid
turned
the
key
which
was
in
the
lock
and
found
monsieur
alain
sitting
by
the
fire
reading
before
he
went
to
bed
his
accustomed
chapter
in
the
imitation
of
jesus
christ
by
the
light
of
two
each
protected
by
a
moveable
green
shade
such
as
use
the
goodman
wore
trousers
and
his
gray
camlet
his
feet
were
at
a
level
with
the
fire
resting
on
a
cushion
done
in
as
were
his
slippers
by
madame
de
la
chanterie
the
fine
head
of
the
old
man
without
other
covering
than
its
crown
of
white
hair
almost
like
that
of
a
monk
stood
out
in
clear
relief
against
the
brown
background
of
an
enormous
armchair
monsieur
alain
gently
laid
his
book
which
was
much
worn
at
the
corners
on
a
little
table
with
twisted
legs
and
signed
to
the
young
man
to
take
another
chair
removing
as
he
did
so
a
pair
of
spectacles
which
were
hanging
on
the
end
of
his
nose
are
you
ill
that
you
have
left
your
room
at
this
hour
he
asked
dear
monsieur
alain
said
godefroid
frankly
i
am
tortured
with
a
curiosity
which
one
word
from
you
will
make
very
harmless
or
very
indiscreet
and
that
explains
clearly
enough
the
spirit
in
which
i
shall
ask
my
oh
oh
and
what
is
your
question
said
the
good
soul
looking
at
the
young
man
with
an
eye
that
was
half
mischievous
what
was
it
that
brought
you
here
to
lead
the
life
that
you
live
here
for
surely
to
accept
the
doctrines
of
such
total
renunciation
of
all
personal
interests
a
man
must
have
been
disgusted
with
the
world
or
else
have
injured
eh
my
dear
lad
replied
the
old
man
letting
a
smile
flicker
on
his
large
lips
which
gave
to
his
rosy
mouth
the
kindliest
expression
that
the
genius
of
a
painter
ever
imagined
can
we
not
be
moved
to
the
deepest
pity
by
the
spectacle
of
human
wretchedness
which
paris
holds
within
her
walls
did
saint
vincent
de
paul
need
the
spur
of
remorse
or
wounded
vanity
to
make
him
devote
himself
to
outcast
children
you
close
my
mouth
for
if
ever
a
soul
resembled
that
of
the
christian
hero
it
is
yours
said
godefroid
in
spite
of
the
hardness
which
age
had
given
to
the
wrinkled
yellow
skin
of
his
face
the
old
man
blushed
for
he
seemed
to
have
provoked
that
comparison
though
any
one
who
knew
his
modesty
would
have
been
certain
he
never
dreamed
of
it
godefroid
was
aware
by
this
time
that
madame
de
la
chanterie
s
inmates
had
no
taste
for
that
sort
of
incense
nevertheless
the
extreme
simplicity
of
the
good
old
soul
was
more
disturbed
by
this
idea
than
a
young
girl
would
have
been
by
an
improper
thought
though
i
am
very
far
indeed
from
saint
vincent
de
paul
morally
said
monsieur
alain
i
think
i
do
resemble
him
godefroid
was
about
to
speak
but
was
stopped
by
a
gesture
of
the
old
man
whose
nose
it
must
be
owned
had
the
tuberous
appearance
of
that
of
the
saint
and
whose
face
a
good
deal
like
that
of
an
old
was
an
exact
duplicate
of
the
broad
common
face
of
the
founder
of
foundling
hospitals
as
for
me
you
are
right
enough
he
went
on
my
vocation
for
our
work
was
brought
about
by
repentance
as
the
result
of
a
a
folly
you
godefroid
exclaimed
softly
the
word
entirely
putting
out
of
his
head
what
he
meant
to
say
ah
dear
me
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
will
seem
i
dare
say
a
trifle
to
you
a
mere
bit
of
nonsense
but
before
the
tribunal
of
conscience
it
was
another
thing
if
you
persist
in
wishing
to
share
our
work
after
hearing
what
i
shall
tell
you
you
will
understand
that
the
power
of
a
sentiment
is
according
to
the
nature
of
souls
and
that
a
matter
which
would
not
in
the
least
trouble
a
strong
mind
may
very
well
torment
the
conscience
of
a
weak
after
a
preface
of
this
kind
the
curiosity
of
the
disciple
of
course
knew
no
bounds
what
could
be
the
crime
of
the
worthy
soul
whom
madame
de
la
chanterie
called
her
the
thought
crossed
godefroid
s
mind
that
a
book
might
be
written
on
it
called
the
sins
of
a
sheep
are
sometimes
quite
ferocious
towards
grass
and
flowers
one
of
the
tenderest
republicans
of
those
days
was
heard
to
assert
that
the
best
of
human
beings
was
cruel
to
something
but
the
kindly
alain
he
who
like
my
uncle
toby
wouldn
t
crush
a
gnat
till
it
had
stung
him
twenty
times
that
sweet
soul
to
have
been
tortured
by
repentance
this
reflection
in
godefroid
s
mind
filled
the
pause
made
by
the
old
man
after
saying
now
listen
to
me
a
pause
he
filled
himself
by
pushing
his
cushion
under
godefroid
s
feet
to
share
it
with
him
i
was
then
about
thirty
years
of
age
he
said
it
was
the
year
if
i
remember
right
a
period
when
young
men
were
forced
to
have
the
experience
of
men
of
sixty
one
morning
a
little
before
my
breakfast
hour
which
was
nine
o
clock
my
old
housekeeper
ushered
in
one
of
the
few
friends
remaining
to
me
after
the
revolution
my
first
word
was
to
ask
him
to
breakfast
my
friend
his
name
was
mongenod
a
fellow
about
years
of
age
accepted
but
he
did
so
in
an
awkward
manner
i
had
not
seen
him
since
mongenod
cried
godefroid
why
that
is
if
you
want
to
know
the
end
before
the
beginning
how
am
i
to
tell
you
my
history
said
the
old
man
smiling
godefroid
made
a
sign
which
promised
absolute
silence
when
mongenod
sat
down
continued
monsieur
alain
i
noticed
that
his
shoes
were
worn
out
his
stockings
had
been
washed
so
often
that
it
was
difficult
to
say
if
they
were
silk
or
not
his
breeches
of
cassimere
were
so
old
that
the
color
had
disappeared
in
spots
and
the
buckles
instead
of
being
of
steel
seemed
to
me
to
be
made
of
common
iron
his
white
flowered
waistcoat
now
yellow
from
long
wearing
also
his
shirt
the
frill
of
which
was
frayed
betrayed
a
horrible
yet
decent
poverty
a
mere
glance
at
his
coat
was
enough
to
convince
me
that
my
friend
had
fallen
into
dire
distress
that
coat
was
in
color
threadbare
at
the
seams
carefully
brushed
though
the
collar
was
greasy
from
pomade
or
powder
and
had
the
white
metal
buttons
now
the
whole
was
so
shabby
that
i
tried
not
to
look
at
it
the
hat
an
opera
hat
of
a
kind
we
then
carried
under
the
arm
and
not
on
the
head
had
seen
many
governments
nevertheless
my
poor
friend
must
have
spent
a
few
sous
at
the
barber
s
for
he
was
neatly
shaved
and
his
hair
gathered
behind
his
head
with
a
comb
and
powdered
carefully
smelt
of
pomade
i
saw
two
chains
hanging
down
on
his
breeches
two
rusty
steel
chains
but
no
appearance
of
a
watch
in
his
pocket
i
tell
you
all
these
details
as
they
come
to
me
said
monsieur
alain
i
seldom
think
of
this
matter
now
but
when
i
do
all
the
particulars
come
vividly
before
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
resumed
it
was
winter
and
mongenod
evidently
had
no
cloak
for
i
noticed
that
several
lumps
of
snow
which
must
have
dropped
from
the
roofs
as
he
walked
along
were
sticking
to
the
collar
of
his
coat
when
he
took
off
his
gloves
and
i
saw
his
right
hand
i
noticed
the
signs
of
labor
and
toilsome
labor
too
now
his
father
the
advocate
of
the
grand
council
had
left
him
some
property
about
five
or
six
thousand
francs
a
year
i
saw
at
once
that
he
had
come
to
me
to
borrow
money
i
had
in
a
secret
two
hundred
louis
d
or
an
enormous
hoard
at
that
time
for
they
were
worth
i
couldn
t
now
tell
you
how
many
hundred
thousand
francs
in
assignats
mongenod
and
i
had
studied
at
the
same
collage
that
of
grassins
and
we
had
met
again
in
the
same
that
of
bordin
a
truly
honest
man
when
you
have
spent
your
boyhood
and
played
your
youthful
pranks
with
the
same
comrade
the
sympathy
between
you
and
him
has
something
sacred
about
it
his
voice
his
glance
stir
certain
chords
in
your
heart
which
only
vibrate
under
the
memories
that
he
brings
back
even
if
you
have
had
cause
of
complaint
against
such
a
comrade
the
rights
of
the
friendship
between
you
can
never
be
effaced
but
there
had
never
been
the
slightest
jar
between
us
two
at
the
death
of
his
father
in
mongenod
was
left
richer
than
i
though
i
had
never
borrowed
money
from
him
i
owed
him
pleasures
which
my
father
s
economy
denied
me
without
my
generous
comrade
i
should
never
had
seen
the
first
representation
of
the
marriage
of
mongenod
was
what
was
called
in
those
days
a
charming
cavalier
he
was
very
gallant
sometimes
i
blamed
him
for
his
facile
way
of
making
intimacies
and
his
too
great
amiability
his
purse
opened
freely
he
lived
in
a
way
he
would
serve
a
man
as
second
having
only
seen
him
twice
good
god
how
you
send
me
back
to
the
days
and
the
ways
of
my
youth
said
the
worthy
man
with
his
cheery
smile
are
you
sorry
said
godefroid
oh
no
and
you
can
judge
by
the
minuteness
with
which
i
am
telling
you
all
this
how
great
a
place
this
event
has
held
in
my
life
mongenod
endowed
with
an
excellent
heart
and
fine
courage
a
trifle
voltairean
was
inclined
to
play
the
nobleman
went
on
monsieur
alain
his
education
at
grassins
where
there
were
many
young
nobles
and
his
various
gallantries
had
given
him
the
polished
manners
and
ways
of
people
of
condition
who
were
then
called
aristocrats
you
can
therefore
imagine
how
great
was
my
surprise
to
see
such
symptoms
of
poverty
in
the
young
and
elegant
mongenod
of
when
my
eyes
left
his
face
and
rested
on
his
garments
but
as
at
that
unhappy
period
of
our
history
some
persons
assumed
a
shabby
exterior
for
safety
and
as
he
might
have
had
some
other
and
sufficient
reasons
for
disguising
himself
i
awaited
an
explanation
although
i
opened
the
way
to
it
what
a
plight
you
are
in
my
dear
mongenod
i
said
accepting
the
pinch
of
snuff
he
offered
me
from
a
copper
and
zinc
sad
indeed
he
answered
i
have
but
one
friend
left
and
that
is
you
i
have
done
all
i
could
to
avoid
appealing
to
you
but
i
must
ask
you
for
a
hundred
louis
the
sum
is
large
i
know
he
went
on
seeing
my
surprise
but
if
you
gave
me
fifty
i
should
be
unable
ever
to
return
them
whereas
with
one
hundred
i
can
seek
my
fortune
in
better
ways
despair
will
inspire
me
to
find
then
you
have
nothing
i
exclaimed
i
have
he
said
brushing
away
a
tear
five
sous
left
of
my
last
piece
of
money
to
come
here
to
you
i
have
had
my
boots
blacked
and
my
face
shaved
i
possess
what
i
have
on
my
back
but
he
added
with
a
gesture
i
owe
my
landlady
a
thousand
francs
in
assignats
and
the
man
i
buy
cold
victuals
from
refused
me
credit
yesterday
i
am
absolutely
without
what
do
you
think
of
doing
enlisting
as
a
soldier
if
you
can
not
help
you
a
soldier
mongenod
i
will
get
myself
killed
or
i
will
be
general
well
i
said
much
moved
eat
your
breakfast
in
peace
i
have
a
hundred
at
that
point
said
the
goodman
interrupting
himself
and
looking
at
godefroid
with
a
shrewd
air
i
thought
it
best
to
tell
him
a
bit
of
a
that
is
all
i
possess
in
the
world
i
said
i
have
been
waiting
for
a
fall
in
the
funds
to
invest
that
money
but
i
will
put
it
in
your
hands
instead
and
you
shall
consider
me
your
partner
i
will
leave
to
your
conscience
the
duty
of
returning
it
to
me
in
due
time
the
conscience
of
an
honest
man
i
said
is
a
better
security
than
the
mongenod
looked
at
me
fixedly
as
i
spoke
and
seemed
to
be
inlaying
my
words
upon
his
heart
he
put
out
his
right
hand
i
laid
my
left
into
it
and
we
held
them
together
i
deeply
moved
and
he
with
two
big
tears
rolling
down
his
cheeks
the
sight
of
those
tears
wrung
my
heart
i
was
more
moved
still
when
mongenod
pulled
out
a
ragged
foulard
handkerchief
to
wipe
them
away
wait
here
i
said
and
i
went
to
my
secret
with
a
heart
as
agitated
as
though
i
had
heard
a
woman
say
she
loved
me
i
came
back
with
two
rolls
of
fifty
louis
each
here
count
he
would
not
count
them
and
he
looked
about
him
for
a
desk
on
which
to
write
he
said
a
proper
receipt
i
positively
refused
to
take
any
paper
if
i
should
die
i
said
my
heirs
would
trouble
you
this
is
to
be
between
well
continued
monsieur
alain
smiling
when
mongenod
found
me
a
good
friend
he
ceased
to
look
as
sad
and
anxious
as
when
he
entered
in
fact
he
became
quite
gay
my
housekeeper
gave
us
some
oysters
white
wine
and
an
omelet
with
broiled
kidneys
and
the
remains
of
a
pate
my
old
mother
had
sent
me
also
some
dessert
coffee
and
liqueur
of
the
iles
mongenod
who
had
been
starving
for
two
days
was
fed
up
we
were
so
interested
in
talking
about
our
life
before
the
revolution
that
we
sat
at
table
till
three
in
the
afternoon
mongenod
told
me
how
he
had
lost
his
fortune
in
the
first
place
his
father
having
invested
the
greater
part
of
his
capital
in
city
loans
when
they
fell
mongenod
lost
two
thirds
of
all
he
had
then
having
sold
his
house
in
the
rue
de
savoie
he
was
forced
to
receive
the
price
in
assignats
after
that
he
took
into
his
head
to
found
a
newspaper
la
sentinelle
that
compelled
him
to
fly
at
the
end
of
six
months
his
hopes
he
said
were
now
fixed
on
the
success
of
a
comic
opera
called
les
when
he
said
that
i
began
to
tremble
mongenod
turned
author
wasting
his
money
on
a
newspaper
living
no
doubt
in
the
theatres
connected
with
singers
at
the
feydeau
with
musicians
and
all
the
queer
people
who
lurk
behind
the
scenes
to
tell
you
the
truth
he
didn
t
seem
my
mongenod
i
trembled
but
how
could
i
take
back
the
hundred
louis
i
saw
each
roll
in
each
pocket
of
his
breeches
like
the
barrels
of
two
pistols
then
continued
monsieur
alain
and
this
time
he
sighed
mongenod
went
away
when
i
was
alone
and
no
longer
in
presence
of
hard
and
cruel
poverty
i
began
in
spite
of
myself
to
reflect
i
was
sobered
mongenod
thought
i
is
perhaps
thoroughly
depraved
he
may
have
been
playing
a
comedy
at
my
his
gaiety
the
moment
i
had
handed
over
to
him
readily
such
a
large
sum
of
money
struck
me
then
as
being
too
like
the
joy
of
the
valets
on
the
stage
when
they
catch
a
geronte
i
ended
where
i
ought
to
have
begun
by
resolving
to
make
some
investigations
as
to
my
friend
mongenod
who
had
given
me
his
address
written
on
the
back
of
a
playing
card
i
did
not
choose
as
a
matter
of
delicacy
to
go
and
see
him
the
next
day
he
might
have
thought
there
was
distrust
in
such
promptness
as
indeed
there
would
have
been
the
second
day
i
had
certain
matters
to
attend
to
which
took
all
my
time
and
it
was
only
at
the
end
of
two
weeks
that
not
seeing
or
hearing
of
mongenod
i
went
one
morning
from
the
where
i
was
then
living
to
the
rue
des
moineaux
where
he
lived
i
found
he
was
living
in
furnished
lodgings
of
the
lowest
class
but
the
landlady
was
a
very
worthy
woman
the
widow
of
a
magistrate
who
had
died
on
the
scaffold
she
was
utterly
ruined
by
the
revolution
and
had
only
a
few
louis
with
which
to
begin
the
hazardous
trade
of
taking
here
monsieur
alain
interrupted
himself
to
explain
i
knew
her
later
he
said
she
then
had
seven
houses
in
and
was
making
quite
a
little
fortune
the
citizen
mongenod
is
not
at
home
the
landlady
said
to
me
but
there
is
some
one
this
remark
excited
my
curiosity
i
went
up
to
the
fifth
story
a
charming
person
opened
the
door
oh
such
a
pretty
young
woman
who
looked
at
me
rather
suspiciously
and
kept
the
door
half
closed
i
am
alain
a
friend
of
mongenod
s
i
said
instantly
the
door
opened
wide
and
i
entered
a
miserable
garret
which
was
nevertheless
kept
with
the
utmost
neatness
the
pretty
young
woman
offered
me
a
chair
before
a
fireplace
where
were
ashes
but
no
fire
at
the
corner
of
which
i
saw
a
common
earthen
it
makes
me
very
happy
monsieur
she
said
taking
my
hand
and
pressing
it
affectionately
to
be
able
to
express
to
you
my
gratitude
you
have
indeed
saved
us
were
it
not
for
you
i
might
never
have
seen
mongenod
again
he
might
yes
he
would
have
thrown
himself
in
the
river
he
was
desperate
when
he
left
me
to
go
and
see
on
examining
this
person
i
was
surprised
to
see
her
head
tied
up
in
a
foulard
and
along
the
temples
a
curious
dark
line
but
i
presently
saw
that
her
head
was
shaved
have
you
been
ill
i
asked
as
i
noticed
this
singularity
she
cast
a
glance
at
a
broken
mirror
in
a
shabby
frame
and
colored
then
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
yes
monsieur
she
said
i
had
horrible
headaches
and
i
was
obliged
to
have
my
hair
cut
off
it
came
to
my
am
i
speaking
to
madame
mongenod
i
asked
yes
monsieur
she
answered
giving
me
a
truly
celestial
look
i
bowed
to
the
poor
little
woman
and
went
away
intending
to
make
the
landlady
tell
me
something
about
them
but
she
was
out
i
was
certain
that
poor
young
woman
had
sold
her
hair
to
buy
bread
i
went
from
there
to
a
wood
merchant
and
ordered
half
a
cord
of
wood
telling
the
cartman
and
the
sawyer
to
take
the
bill
which
i
made
the
dealer
receipt
to
the
name
of
citizen
mongenod
and
give
it
to
the
little
woman
there
ends
the
period
of
what
i
long
called
said
monsieur
alain
clasping
his
hands
and
lifting
them
with
a
look
of
repentance
godefroid
could
not
help
smiling
he
was
as
we
shall
see
greatly
mistaken
in
that
smile
two
days
later
resumed
the
worthy
man
i
met
one
of
those
men
who
are
neither
friends
nor
strangers
with
whom
we
have
relations
from
time
to
time
and
call
acquaintances
a
certain
monsieur
barillaud
who
remarked
accidentally
of
the
peruviens
that
the
author
was
a
friend
of
his
then
you
know
citizen
mongenod
i
said
in
those
days
we
were
obliged
by
law
to
call
each
other
citizen
said
monsieur
alain
to
godefroid
by
way
of
parenthesis
then
he
continued
his
narrative
the
citizen
looked
at
me
exclaiming
i
wish
i
never
had
known
him
for
he
has
several
times
borrowed
money
of
me
and
shown
his
friendship
by
not
returning
it
he
is
a
queer
fellow
and
all
that
but
full
of
illusions
always
an
imagination
on
fire
i
will
do
him
this
justice
he
does
not
mean
to
deceive
but
as
he
deceives
himself
about
everything
he
manages
to
behave
like
a
dishonest
how
much
does
he
owe
you
i
asked
oh
a
good
many
hundred
francs
he
s
a
basket
with
a
hole
in
the
bottom
nobody
knows
where
his
money
goes
perhaps
he
doesn
t
know
has
he
any
resources
well
yes
said
barillaud
laughing
just
now
he
is
talking
of
buying
land
among
the
savages
in
the
united
i
carried
away
with
me
the
drop
of
vinegar
which
casual
gossip
thus
put
into
my
heart
and
it
soured
all
my
feelings
i
went
to
see
my
old
master
in
whose
office
mongenod
and
i
had
studied
law
he
was
now
my
counsel
when
i
told
him
about
my
loan
to
mongenod
and
the
manner
in
which
i
had
acted
what
he
cried
one
of
my
old
clerks
to
behave
in
that
way
you
ought
to
have
put
him
off
till
the
next
day
and
come
to
see
me
you
would
then
have
found
out
that
i
have
forbidden
my
clerks
to
let
mongenod
into
this
office
within
the
last
year
he
has
borrowed
three
hundred
francs
of
me
in
silver
an
enormous
sum
at
present
rates
three
days
before
he
breakfasted
with
you
i
met
him
on
the
street
and
he
gave
such
a
piteous
account
of
his
poverty
that
i
let
him
have
two
if
i
have
been
the
dupe
of
a
clever
comedian
i
said
to
bordin
so
much
the
worse
for
him
not
for
me
but
tell
me
what
to
you
must
try
to
get
from
him
a
written
acknowledgment
for
a
debtor
however
insolvent
he
may
be
may
become
solvent
and
then
he
will
thereupon
bordin
took
from
a
tin
box
a
case
on
which
i
saw
the
name
of
mongenod
he
showed
me
three
receipts
of
a
hundred
francs
each
the
next
time
he
comes
i
shall
have
him
admitted
and
i
shall
make
him
add
the
interest
and
the
two
louis
and
give
me
a
note
for
the
whole
i
shall
at
any
rate
have
things
properly
done
and
be
in
a
position
to
obtain
well
said
i
to
bordin
can
you
have
my
matter
set
right
so
far
as
well
as
yours
for
i
know
you
are
a
good
man
and
what
you
do
will
be
i
have
remained
master
of
my
ground
he
said
but
when
persons
behave
as
you
have
done
they
are
at
the
mercy
of
a
man
who
can
snap
his
fingers
at
them
as
for
me
i
don
t
choose
that
any
man
should
get
the
better
of
me
get
the
better
of
a
former
attorney
to
the
chatelet
every
man
to
whom
a
sum
of
money
is
lent
as
heedlessly
as
you
lent
yours
to
mongenod
ends
after
a
certain
time
by
thinking
that
money
his
own
it
is
no
longer
your
money
it
is
money
you
become
his
creditor
an
inconvenient
unpleasant
person
a
debtor
will
then
try
to
get
rid
of
you
by
some
juggling
with
his
conscience
and
out
of
one
hundred
men
in
his
position
will
do
their
best
never
to
see
or
hear
of
you
then
you
think
only
men
in
a
hundred
are
honest
did
i
say
that
he
replied
smiling
maliciously
the
estimate
is
too
high
monsieur
alain
paused
to
put
the
fire
together
that
done
he
resumed
two
weeks
later
i
received
a
letter
from
bordin
asking
me
to
go
to
his
office
and
get
my
receipt
i
went
i
tried
to
get
fifty
of
your
louis
for
you
he
said
but
the
birds
had
flown
say
to
your
yellow
boys
those
pretty
canaries
are
off
to
other
climes
you
have
had
to
do
with
a
sharper
that
s
what
he
is
he
declared
to
me
that
his
wife
and
had
gone
to
the
united
states
with
sixty
of
your
louis
to
buy
land
that
he
intended
to
follow
for
the
purpose
he
said
of
making
a
fortune
and
paying
his
debts
the
amount
of
which
carefully
drawn
up
he
confided
to
me
requesting
me
to
keep
an
eye
on
what
became
of
his
creditors
here
is
a
list
of
the
items
continued
bordin
showing
me
a
paper
from
which
he
read
the
total
seventeen
thousand
francs
in
coin
a
sum
with
which
a
house
could
be
bought
that
would
bring
in
two
thousand
francs
a
after
replacing
the
list
in
the
case
bordin
gave
me
a
note
for
a
sum
equivalent
to
a
hundred
louis
in
gold
with
a
letter
in
which
mongenod
admitted
having
received
my
hundred
louis
on
which
he
owed
interest
so
now
i
am
all
right
i
said
to
bordin
he
can
not
deny
the
debt
replied
my
old
master
but
where
there
are
no
funds
even
the
king
i
should
say
the
directory
can
t
enforce
i
went
home
believing
that
i
had
been
robbed
in
a
way
intentionally
screened
from
the
law
i
withdrew
my
esteem
from
mongenod
and
resigned
myself
philosophically
if
i
have
dwelt
on
these
details
which
are
so
commonplace
and
seem
so
slight
said
the
worthy
man
looking
at
godefroid
it
is
not
without
good
reason
i
want
to
explain
to
you
how
i
was
led
to
act
as
most
men
act
in
defiance
of
the
rules
which
savages
observe
in
the
smallest
matters
many
persons
would
justify
themselves
by
the
opinion
of
so
excellent
a
man
as
bordin
but
i
know
myself
to
have
been
inexcusable
when
it
comes
to
condemning
one
of
our
fellows
and
withdrawing
our
esteem
from
him
we
should
act
from
our
own
convictions
only
but
have
we
any
right
to
make
our
heart
a
tribunal
before
which
we
arraign
our
neighbor
where
is
the
law
what
is
our
standard
of
judgment
that
which
in
us
is
weakness
may
be
strength
in
our
neighbor
so
many
beings
so
many
different
circumstances
for
every
act
and
there
are
no
two
beings
exactly
alike
in
all
humanity
society
alone
has
the
right
over
its
members
of
repression
as
for
punishment
i
deny
it
that
right
repression
suffices
and
that
besides
brings
with
it
punishment
enough
so
resumed
monsieur
alain
continuing
his
history
having
drawn
from
it
that
noble
teaching
after
listening
to
the
gossip
of
the
parisian
and
relying
on
the
wisdom
of
my
old
master
i
condemned
mongenod
his
play
les
peruviens
was
announced
i
expected
to
receive
a
ticket
from
mongenod
for
the
first
representation
i
established
in
my
own
mind
a
sort
of
claim
on
him
it
seemed
to
me
that
by
reason
of
my
loan
my
friend
was
a
sort
of
vassal
of
mine
who
owed
me
a
number
of
things
besides
the
interest
on
my
money
we
all
think
that
mongenod
not
only
did
not
send
me
a
ticket
but
i
saw
him
from
a
distance
coming
towards
me
in
that
dark
passage
under
the
theatre
feydeau
well
dressed
almost
elegant
he
pretended
not
to
see
me
then
after
he
had
passed
and
i
turned
to
run
after
him
my
debtor
hastily
escaped
through
a
transverse
alley
this
circumstance
greatly
irritated
me
and
the
irritation
instead
of
subsiding
with
time
only
increased
and
for
the
following
reason
some
days
after
this
encounter
i
wrote
to
mongenod
somewhat
in
these
terms
my
friend
you
ought
not
to
think
me
indifferent
to
whatever
happens
to
you
of
good
or
evil
are
you
satisfied
with
the
success
of
les
peruviens
you
forgot
me
of
course
it
was
your
right
to
do
so
for
the
first
representation
at
which
i
should
have
applauded
you
but
nevertheless
i
hope
you
found
a
peru
in
your
peruvians
for
i
have
found
a
use
for
my
funds
and
shall
look
to
you
for
the
payment
of
them
when
the
note
falls
due
your
friend
after
waiting
two
weeks
for
an
answer
i
went
to
the
rue
des
moineaux
the
landlady
told
me
that
the
little
wife
really
did
go
away
with
her
father
at
the
time
when
mongenod
told
bordin
of
their
departure
mongenod
always
left
the
garret
very
early
in
the
morning
and
did
not
return
till
late
at
night
another
two
weeks
i
wrote
again
thus
my
dear
mongenod
i
can
not
find
you
and
you
do
not
reply
to
my
letters
i
do
not
understand
your
conduct
if
i
behaved
thus
to
you
what
would
you
think
of
me
i
did
not
subscribe
the
letter
as
before
your
friend
i
merely
wrote
kind
well
it
was
all
of
no
use
said
monsieur
alain
a
month
went
by
and
i
had
no
news
of
mongenod
les
peruviens
did
not
obtain
the
great
success
on
which
he
counted
i
went
to
the
twentieth
representation
thinking
to
find
him
and
obtain
my
money
the
house
was
less
than
half
full
but
madame
scio
was
very
beautiful
they
told
me
in
the
foyer
that
the
play
would
run
a
few
nights
longer
i
went
seven
different
times
to
mongenod
s
lodging
and
did
not
find
him
each
time
i
left
my
name
with
the
landlady
at
last
i
wrote
again
monsieur
if
you
do
not
wish
to
lose
my
respect
as
you
have
my
friendship
you
will
treat
me
now
as
a
stranger
that
is
to
say
with
politeness
and
you
will
tell
me
when
you
will
be
ready
to
pay
your
note
which
is
now
due
i
shall
act
according
to
your
answer
your
obedient
servant
no
answer
we
were
then
in
one
year
all
but
two
months
had
expired
at
the
end
of
those
two
months
i
went
to
bordin
bordin
took
the
note
had
it
protested
and
sued
mongenod
for
me
meantime
the
disasters
of
the
french
armies
had
produced
such
depreciation
of
the
funds
that
investors
could
buy
a
dividend
on
seven
francs
capital
therefore
for
my
hundred
louis
in
gold
i
might
have
bought
myself
fifteen
hundred
francs
of
income
every
morning
as
i
took
my
coffee
and
read
the
paper
i
said
to
myself
that
cursed
mongenod
if
it
were
not
for
him
i
should
have
three
thousand
francs
a
year
to
live
mongenod
became
my
i
inveighed
against
him
even
as
i
walked
the
streets
bordin
is
there
i
thought
to
myself
bordin
will
put
the
screws
on
and
a
good
thing
my
feelings
turned
to
hatred
and
my
hatred
to
imprecations
i
cursed
the
man
and
i
believed
he
had
every
vice
ah
monsieur
barillaud
was
very
right
thought
i
in
all
he
told
me
monsieur
alain
paused
reflectively
yes
he
said
again
i
thought
him
very
right
in
all
he
told
me
at
last
one
morning
in
came
my
debtor
no
more
embarrassed
than
if
he
didn
t
owe
me
a
sou
when
i
saw
him
i
felt
all
the
shame
he
ought
to
have
felt
i
was
like
a
criminal
taken
in
the
act
i
was
all
upset
the
eighteenth
brumaire
had
just
taken
place
public
affairs
were
doing
well
the
funds
had
gone
up
bonaparte
was
off
to
fight
the
battle
of
marengo
it
is
unfortunate
monsieur
i
said
receiving
mongenod
standing
that
i
owe
your
visit
to
a
sheriff
s
mongenod
took
a
chair
and
sat
down
i
came
to
tell
you
he
said
that
i
am
totally
unable
to
pay
you
made
me
miss
a
fine
investment
before
the
election
of
the
first
consul
an
investment
which
would
have
given
me
a
little
i
know
it
alain
he
said
i
know
it
but
what
is
the
good
of
suing
me
and
crushing
me
with
bills
of
costs
i
have
nothing
with
which
to
pay
anything
lately
i
received
letters
from
my
wife
and
they
have
bought
land
with
the
money
you
lent
me
and
they
send
me
a
list
of
things
they
need
to
improve
it
now
unless
some
one
prevents
it
i
shall
sail
on
a
dutch
vessel
from
flushing
whither
i
have
sent
the
few
things
i
am
taking
out
to
them
bonaparte
has
won
the
battle
of
marengo
peace
will
be
signed
i
may
safely
rejoin
my
family
and
i
have
need
to
for
my
dear
little
wife
is
about
to
give
birth
to
a
and
so
you
have
sacrificed
me
to
your
own
interests
said
i
yes
he
answered
for
i
believed
you
my
at
that
moment
i
felt
myself
inferior
to
mongenod
so
sublime
did
he
seem
to
me
as
he
said
those
grand
words
did
i
not
speak
to
you
frankly
he
said
in
this
very
room
i
came
to
you
alain
as
the
only
person
who
would
really
understand
me
i
told
you
that
fifty
louis
would
be
lost
but
a
hundred
i
could
return
to
you
i
did
not
bind
myself
by
saying
when
for
how
could
i
know
the
time
at
which
my
long
struggle
with
disaster
would
end
you
were
my
last
friend
all
others
even
our
old
master
bordin
despised
me
for
the
very
reason
that
i
borrowed
money
of
them
oh
you
do
not
know
alain
the
dreadful
sensation
which
grips
the
heart
of
an
honest
man
when
in
the
throes
of
poverty
he
goes
to
a
friend
and
asks
him
for
succor
and
all
that
follows
i
hope
you
never
may
know
it
it
is
far
worse
than
the
anguish
of
death
you
have
written
me
letters
which
if
i
had
written
them
to
you
in
a
like
situation
you
would
have
thought
very
odious
you
expected
of
me
that
which
it
was
out
of
my
power
to
do
but
you
are
the
only
person
to
whom
i
shall
try
to
justify
myself
in
spite
of
your
severity
and
though
from
being
a
friend
you
became
a
creditor
on
the
day
when
bordin
asked
for
my
note
on
your
behalf
thus
abrogating
the
generous
compact
you
had
made
with
me
there
on
that
spot
when
we
clasped
hands
and
mingled
our
tears
well
in
spite
of
all
that
i
have
remembered
that
day
and
because
of
it
i
have
come
here
to
say
to
you
you
do
not
know
misery
therefore
do
not
judge
it
i
have
not
had
one
moment
when
i
could
answer
you
would
you
have
wished
me
to
come
here
and
cajole
you
with
words
i
could
not
pay
you
i
did
not
even
have
enough
for
the
bare
necessities
of
those
whose
lives
depended
on
me
my
play
brought
little
a
novice
in
theatrical
ways
i
became
a
prey
to
musicians
actors
journalists
orchestras
to
get
the
means
to
leave
paris
and
join
my
family
and
carry
to
them
the
few
things
they
need
i
have
sold
les
peruviens
outright
to
the
director
with
two
other
pieces
which
i
had
in
my
portfolio
i
start
for
holland
without
a
sou
i
must
reach
flushing
as
best
i
can
my
voyage
is
paid
that
is
all
were
it
not
for
the
pity
of
my
landlady
who
has
confidence
in
me
i
should
have
to
travel
on
foot
with
my
bag
upon
my
back
but
in
spite
of
your
doubts
of
me
i
remembering
that
without
you
i
never
could
have
sent
my
wife
and
to
new
york
am
forever
grateful
to
you
no
monsieur
alain
i
shall
not
forget
that
the
hundred
louis
d
or
you
lent
me
would
have
yielded
you
fifteen
hundred
francs
a
i
desire
to
believe
you
mongenod
i
said
shaken
by
the
tone
in
which
he
made
this
explanation
ah
you
no
longer
say
to
me
he
said
quickly
with
a
tender
glance
my
god
i
shall
quit
france
with
less
regret
if
i
can
leave
one
man
behind
me
in
whose
eyes
i
am
not
half
a
swindler
nor
a
spendthrift
nor
a
man
of
illusions
alain
i
have
loved
an
angel
in
the
midst
of
my
misery
a
man
who
truly
loves
can
not
be
at
those
words
i
stretched
out
my
hand
to
him
he
took
it
and
wrung
it
may
heaven
protect
you
i
said
are
we
still
friends
he
asked
yes
i
replied
it
shall
never
be
that
my
childhood
s
comrade
and
the
friend
of
my
youth
left
me
for
america
under
the
feeling
that
i
was
angry
with
mongenod
kissed
me
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
rushed
monsieur
alain
stopped
in
his
narrative
for
an
instant
and
looked
at
godefroid
i
remember
that
day
with
some
satisfaction
he
said
then
he
resumed
a
week
or
so
later
i
met
bordin
and
told
him
of
that
interview
he
smiled
and
said
i
hope
it
was
not
a
pretty
bit
of
comedy
didn
t
he
ask
for
anything
no
i
answered
well
he
came
to
see
me
the
same
day
i
was
almost
as
touched
as
you
and
he
asked
me
for
means
to
get
food
on
his
journey
well
well
time
will
show
these
remarks
of
bordin
made
me
fear
i
had
foolishly
yielded
to
mistaken
sensibility
nevertheless
i
said
to
myself
he
the
old
lawyer
did
as
i
i
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
explain
to
you
how
i
lost
all
or
nearly
all
my
property
i
had
placed
a
little
in
the
funds
which
gave
me
five
hundred
francs
a
year
all
else
was
gone
i
was
then
years
old
i
obtained
through
the
influence
of
monsieur
bordin
a
place
as
clerk
with
a
salary
of
eight
hundred
francs
in
a
branch
office
of
the
rue
des
augustins
from
that
time
i
lived
very
modestly
i
found
a
small
lodging
in
the
rue
des
marais
on
the
third
floor
two
rooms
and
a
closet
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
francs
a
year
i
dined
at
a
common
for
forty
francs
a
month
i
copied
writings
at
night
ugly
as
i
was
and
poor
i
had
to
renounce
the
and
its
branches
are
under
control
of
the
tr
as
godefroid
heard
this
judgment
which
the
poor
man
passed
upon
himself
with
beautiful
simplicity
and
resignation
he
made
a
movement
which
proved
far
more
than
any
confidence
in
words
could
have
done
the
resemblance
of
their
destinies
and
the
goodman
in
answer
to
that
eloquent
gesture
seemed
to
expect
the
words
that
followed
it
have
you
never
been
loved
asked
godefroid
never
he
said
except
by
madame
who
returns
to
us
all
the
love
we
have
for
her
a
love
which
i
may
call
divine
you
must
be
aware
of
it
we
live
through
her
life
as
she
lives
through
ours
we
have
but
one
soul
among
us
and
such
pleasures
though
they
are
not
physical
are
none
the
less
intense
we
exist
through
our
hearts
ah
my
child
he
continued
when
women
come
to
appreciate
moral
qualities
they
are
indifferent
to
others
and
they
are
then
old
oh
i
have
suffered
deeply
yes
deeply
and
i
in
the
same
way
said
godefroid
under
the
empire
said
the
worthy
man
resuming
his
narrative
the
funds
did
not
always
pay
their
dividends
regularly
it
was
necessary
to
be
prepared
for
suspensions
of
payment
from
to
there
was
scarcely
a
week
that
i
did
not
attribute
my
misfortune
to
mongenod
if
it
were
not
for
mongenod
i
used
to
say
to
myself
i
might
have
married
if
i
had
never
known
him
i
should
not
be
obliged
to
live
in
such
but
then
again
there
were
other
times
when
i
said
perhaps
the
unfortunate
fellow
has
met
with
ill
luck
over
in
at
a
time
when
i
found
my
life
particularly
hard
to
bear
i
wrote
him
a
long
letter
which
i
sent
by
way
of
holland
i
received
no
answer
i
waited
three
years
placing
all
my
hopes
on
that
answer
at
last
i
resigned
myself
to
my
life
to
the
five
hundred
francs
i
received
from
the
funds
i
now
added
twelve
hundred
from
the
for
they
raised
my
salary
and
five
hundred
which
i
obtained
from
monsieur
cesar
birotteau
perfumer
for
keeping
his
books
in
the
evening
thus
not
only
did
i
manage
to
get
along
comfortably
but
i
laid
by
eight
hundred
francs
a
year
at
the
beginning
of
i
invested
nine
thousand
francs
of
my
savings
at
forty
francs
in
the
funds
and
thus
i
was
sure
of
sixteen
hundred
francs
a
year
for
my
old
age
by
that
time
i
had
fifteen
hundred
a
year
from
the
six
hundred
for
my
sixteen
hundred
from
the
funds
in
all
three
thousand
seven
hundred
francs
a
year
i
took
a
lodging
in
the
rue
de
seine
and
lived
a
little
better
my
place
had
brought
me
into
relations
with
many
unfortunates
for
the
last
twelve
years
i
had
known
better
than
any
man
whatsoever
the
misery
of
the
poor
once
or
twice
i
had
been
able
to
do
a
real
service
i
felt
a
vivid
pleasure
when
i
found
that
out
of
ten
persons
relieved
one
or
two
households
had
been
put
on
their
feet
it
came
into
my
mind
that
benevolence
ought
not
to
consist
in
throwing
money
to
those
who
suffered
doing
charity
to
use
that
common
expression
seemed
to
me
too
often
a
premium
offered
to
crime
i
began
to
study
the
question
i
was
then
fifty
years
of
age
and
my
life
was
nearly
over
of
what
good
am
i
thought
i
to
whom
can
i
leave
my
savings
when
i
have
furnished
my
rooms
handsomely
and
found
a
good
cook
and
made
my
life
suitable
in
all
respects
what
then
how
shall
i
employ
my
time
eleven
years
of
revolution
and
fifteen
years
of
poverty
had
as
i
may
say
eaten
up
the
most
precious
parts
of
my
life
used
it
up
in
sterile
toil
for
my
own
individual
preservation
no
man
at
the
age
of
fifty
could
spring
from
that
obscure
repressed
condition
to
a
brilliant
future
but
every
man
could
be
of
use
i
understood
by
this
time
that
watchful
care
and
wise
counsels
have
tenfold
greater
value
than
money
given
for
the
poor
above
all
things
need
a
guide
if
only
in
the
labor
they
do
for
others
for
speculators
are
never
lacking
to
take
advantage
of
them
here
i
saw
before
me
both
an
end
and
an
occupation
not
to
speak
of
the
exquisite
enjoyments
obtained
by
playing
in
a
miniature
way
the
role
of
and
you
play
it
in
a
grand
way
do
you
not
asked
godefroid
eagerly
ah
you
want
to
know
everything
said
the
old
man
no
no
would
you
believe
it
he
continued
after
this
interruption
the
smallness
of
my
means
to
do
the
work
i
now
desired
to
do
brought
back
the
thought
of
mongenod
if
it
were
not
for
mongenod
i
kept
saying
to
myself
i
could
do
so
much
more
if
a
dishonest
man
had
not
deprived
me
of
fifteen
hundred
francs
a
year
i
could
save
this
or
that
poor
excusing
my
own
impotence
by
accusing
another
i
felt
that
the
miseries
of
those
to
whom
i
could
offer
nothing
but
words
of
consolation
were
a
curse
upon
mongenod
that
thought
soothed
my
heart
one
morning
in
january
my
housekeeper
announced
whom
do
you
suppose
mongenod
monsieur
mongenod
and
whom
do
you
think
i
saw
enter
my
room
the
beautiful
young
woman
i
had
once
seen
only
now
she
was
years
old
followed
by
her
three
children
and
mongenod
he
looked
younger
than
when
he
went
away
for
prosperity
and
happiness
do
shed
a
halo
round
their
favorites
thin
pale
yellow
shrivelled
when
i
last
saw
him
he
was
now
plump
sleek
rosy
as
a
prebendary
and
well
dressed
he
flung
himself
into
my
arms
feeling
perhaps
that
i
received
him
coldly
his
first
words
were
friend
i
could
not
come
sooner
the
ocean
was
not
free
to
passenger
ships
till
then
it
took
me
a
year
to
close
up
my
business
and
realize
my
property
i
have
succeeded
my
friend
when
i
received
your
letter
in
i
started
in
a
dutch
vessel
to
bring
you
myself
a
little
fortune
but
the
union
of
holland
with
the
french
empire
caused
the
vessel
to
be
taken
by
the
english
and
sent
to
jamaica
from
which
island
i
escaped
by
mere
chance
when
i
reached
new
york
i
found
i
was
a
victim
to
the
bankruptcy
of
others
in
my
absence
my
poor
charlotte
had
not
been
able
to
protect
herself
against
schemers
i
was
therefore
forced
to
build
up
once
more
the
edifice
of
my
fortunes
however
it
is
all
done
now
and
here
we
are
by
the
way
those
children
are
looking
at
you
you
must
be
aware
that
we
have
often
talked
to
them
of
their
father
s
oh
yes
yes
monsieur
said
the
beautiful
mongenod
we
have
never
passed
a
single
day
without
remembering
you
your
share
has
been
set
aside
in
all
our
affairs
we
have
looked
forward
eagerly
to
the
happiness
we
now
have
in
returning
to
you
your
fortune
not
thinking
for
a
moment
that
the
payment
of
these
just
dues
can
ever
wipe
out
our
debt
of
with
those
words
madame
mongenod
held
out
to
me
that
magnificent
box
you
see
over
there
in
which
were
one
hundred
and
fifty
notes
of
a
thousand
francs
the
old
man
paused
an
instant
as
if
to
dwell
on
that
moment
then
he
went
on
mongenod
looked
at
me
fixedly
and
said
my
poor
alain
you
have
suffered
i
know
but
we
did
divine
your
sufferings
we
did
try
every
means
to
send
the
money
to
you
and
failed
in
every
attempt
you
told
me
you
could
not
marry
that
i
had
prevented
it
but
here
is
our
eldest
daughter
she
has
been
brought
up
in
the
thought
of
becoming
your
wife
and
she
will
have
a
dowry
of
five
hundred
thousand
god
forbid
that
i
should
make
her
miserable
i
cried
hastily
looking
at
the
girl
who
was
as
beautiful
as
her
mother
when
i
first
saw
her
i
drew
her
to
me
to
kiss
her
brow
don
t
be
afraid
my
beautiful
child
i
said
a
man
of
fifty
to
a
girl
of
seventeen
never
and
a
man
as
plain
and
ugly
as
i
am
never
i
cried
monsieur
she
said
my
father
s
benefactor
could
not
be
ugly
for
those
words
said
spontaneously
with
simple
candor
made
me
understand
how
true
was
all
that
mongenod
had
said
i
then
gave
him
my
hand
and
we
embraced
each
other
again
my
friend
i
said
i
have
done
you
wrong
i
have
often
accused
you
cursed
you
had
the
right
to
do
so
alain
he
replied
blushing
you
suffered
and
through
i
took
mongenod
s
note
from
my
desk
and
returned
it
to
him
you
will
all
stay
and
breakfast
with
me
i
hope
i
said
to
the
family
on
condition
that
you
dine
with
us
said
mongenod
we
arrived
yesterday
we
are
going
to
buy
a
house
and
i
mean
to
open
a
banking
business
between
paris
and
north
america
so
as
to
leave
it
to
this
fellow
here
he
added
showing
me
his
eldest
son
who
was
fifteen
years
old
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
together
and
went
to
the
play
for
mongenod
and
his
family
were
actually
hungry
for
the
theatre
the
next
morning
i
placed
the
whole
sum
in
the
funds
and
i
now
had
in
all
about
fifteen
thousand
francs
a
year
this
fortune
enabled
me
to
give
up
at
night
and
also
to
resign
my
place
at
the
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
underling
who
stepped
into
my
shoes
my
friend
died
in
at
the
age
of
after
founding
the
great
of
mongenod
and
company
which
made
enormous
profits
from
the
first
loans
under
the
restoration
his
daughter
to
whom
he
subsequently
gave
a
million
in
dowry
married
the
vicomte
de
fontaine
the
eldest
son
whom
you
know
is
not
yet
married
he
lives
with
his
mother
and
brother
we
obtain
from
them
all
the
sums
we
need
frederic
his
father
gave
him
my
name
in
america
frederic
mongenod
is
at
years
of
age
one
of
the
ablest
and
most
upright
bankers
in
paris
not
very
long
ago
madame
mongenod
admitted
to
me
that
she
had
sold
her
hair
as
i
suspected
for
twelve
francs
to
buy
bread
she
gives
me
now
cords
of
wood
a
year
for
my
poor
people
in
exchange
for
the
half
cord
which
i
once
sent
this
explains
to
me
your
relations
with
the
house
of
mongenod
said
godefroid
and
your
again
the
goodman
looked
at
godefroid
with
a
smile
and
the
same
expression
of
kindly
mischief
oh
go
on
said
godefroid
seeing
from
his
manner
that
he
had
more
to
tell
this
conclusion
my
dear
godefroid
made
the
deepest
impression
on
me
if
the
man
who
had
suffered
so
much
if
my
friend
forgave
my
injustice
i
could
not
forgive
oh
ejaculated
godefroid
i
resolved
to
devote
all
my
superfluous
means
about
ten
thousand
francs
a
year
to
acts
of
intelligent
benevolence
continued
monsieur
alain
tranquilly
about
this
time
it
was
that
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
judge
of
the
lower
civil
court
of
the
seine
named
popinot
whom
we
had
the
great
grief
of
losing
three
years
ago
and
who
practised
for
fifteen
years
an
active
and
most
intelligent
charity
in
the
quartier
it
was
he
with
the
venerable
vicar
of
and
madame
who
first
thought
of
founding
the
work
in
which
we
are
now
and
which
since
has
quietly
done
much
good
this
work
has
found
its
soul
in
madame
de
la
chanterie
for
she
is
truly
the
inspiration
of
this
enterprise
the
vicar
has
known
how
to
make
us
more
religious
than
we
were
at
first
by
showing
us
the
necessity
of
being
virtuous
ourselves
in
order
to
inspire
virtue
in
short
to
preach
by
example
the
farther
we
have
advanced
in
our
work
the
happier
we
have
mutually
found
ourselves
and
so
you
see
it
really
was
the
repentance
i
felt
for
misconceiving
the
heart
of
my
friend
which
gave
me
the
idea
of
devoting
to
the
poor
through
my
own
hands
the
fortune
he
returned
to
me
and
which
i
accepted
without
objecting
to
the
immensity
of
the
sum
returned
in
proportion
to
the
sum
lent
its
destination
justified
my
taking
this
narration
made
quietly
without
assumption
but
with
a
gentle
kindliness
in
accent
look
and
gesture
would
have
inspired
godefroid
to
enter
this
noble
and
sacred
association
if
his
resolution
had
not
already
been
taken
you
know
the
world
very
little
he
said
if
you
have
such
scruples
about
a
matter
that
would
not
weigh
on
any
other
man
s
i
know
only
the
unfortunate
said
monsieur
alain
i
do
not
desire
to
know
a
world
in
which
men
are
so
little
afraid
of
judging
one
another
but
see
it
is
almost
midnight
and
i
still
have
my
chapter
of
the
imitation
of
jesus
christ
to
meditate
upon
godefroid
took
the
old
man
s
hand
and
pressed
it
with
an
expression
of
admiration
can
you
tell
me
madame
de
la
chanterie
s
history
impossible
without
her
consent
replied
monsieur
alain
for
it
is
connected
with
one
of
the
most
terrible
events
of
imperial
policy
it
was
through
my
friend
bordin
that
i
first
knew
madame
he
had
in
his
possession
all
the
secrets
of
that
noble
life
it
was
he
who
if
i
may
say
so
led
me
to
this
i
thank
you
said
godefroid
for
having
told
me
your
life
there
are
many
lessons
in
it
for
do
you
know
what
is
the
moral
of
it
tell
me
said
godefroid
for
perhaps
i
may
see
something
different
in
it
from
what
you
well
it
is
this
that
pleasure
is
an
accident
in
a
christian
s
life
it
is
not
the
aim
of
it
and
this
we
learn
too
what
happens
when
we
turn
to
christianity
asked
godefroid
see
said
the
goodman
he
pointed
with
his
finger
to
some
letters
of
gold
on
a
black
ground
which
the
new
lodger
had
not
observed
for
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
been
in
monsieur
alain
s
room
godefroid
turned
and
read
the
words
transire
benefaciendo
that
is
our
motto
if
you
become
one
of
us
that
will
be
your
only
commission
we
read
that
commission
which
we
have
given
to
ourselves
at
all
times
in
the
morning
when
we
rise
in
the
evening
when
we
lie
down
and
when
we
are
dressing
ah
if
you
did
but
know
what
immense
pleasures
there
are
in
accomplishing
that
motto
such
as
said
godefroid
hoping
for
further
revelations
i
must
tell
you
that
we
are
as
rich
as
baron
de
nucingen
himself
but
the
imitation
of
jesus
christ
forbids
us
to
regard
our
wealth
as
our
own
we
are
only
the
spenders
of
it
and
if
we
had
any
pride
in
being
that
we
should
not
be
worthy
of
dispensing
it
it
would
not
be
it
would
be
inward
enjoyment
for
if
you
say
to
yourself
with
a
swelling
of
the
nostrils
i
play
the
part
of
providence
as
you
might
have
thought
if
you
had
been
in
my
place
this
morning
and
saved
the
future
lives
of
a
whole
family
you
would
become
a
sardanapalus
an
evil
one
none
of
these
gentlemen
living
here
thinks
of
himself
when
he
does
good
all
vanity
all
pride
all
must
be
stripped
off
and
that
is
hard
to
do
yes
very
godefroid
bade
him
and
returned
to
his
own
room
deeply
affected
by
this
narrative
but
his
curiosity
was
more
whetted
than
satisfied
for
the
central
figure
of
the
picture
was
madame
de
la
chanterie
the
history
of
the
life
of
that
woman
became
of
the
utmost
importance
to
him
so
that
he
made
the
obtaining
of
it
the
object
of
his
stay
in
that
house
he
already
perceived
in
this
association
of
five
persons
a
vast
enterprise
of
charity
but
he
thought
far
less
of
that
than
he
did
of
its
heroine
viii
who
she
was
wife
and
mother
the
disciple
passed
many
days
in
observing
more
carefully
than
he
had
hitherto
done
the
rare
persons
among
whom
fate
had
brought
him
and
he
became
the
subject
of
a
moral
phenomenon
which
modern
philosophers
have
despised
possibly
out
of
ignorance
the
sphere
in
which
he
lived
had
a
positive
action
upon
godefroid
the
laws
which
regulate
the
physical
nature
under
relation
to
the
atmospheric
environment
in
which
it
is
developed
rule
also
in
the
moral
nature
hence
it
follows
that
the
assembling
together
of
condemned
prisoners
is
one
of
the
greatest
of
social
crimes
and
also
that
their
isolation
is
an
experiment
of
doubtful
success
condemned
criminals
ought
to
be
in
religious
institutions
surrounded
by
prodigies
of
good
instead
of
being
cast
as
they
are
into
sight
and
knowledge
of
evil
only
the
church
can
be
expected
to
show
an
absolute
devotion
in
this
matter
if
it
sends
missionaries
to
heathen
or
savage
nations
with
how
much
greater
joy
would
it
welcome
the
mission
of
redeeming
the
heathen
of
civilization
for
all
criminals
are
atheists
and
often
without
knowing
they
are
so
godefroid
found
these
five
associated
persons
endowed
with
the
qualities
they
required
in
him
they
were
all
without
pride
without
vanity
truly
humble
and
pious
also
without
any
of
the
pretension
which
constitutes
using
that
word
in
its
worst
sense
these
virtues
were
contagious
he
was
filled
with
a
desire
to
imitate
these
hidden
heroes
and
he
ended
by
passionately
studying
the
book
he
had
begun
by
despising
within
two
weeks
he
reduced
his
views
of
life
to
its
simplest
lines
to
what
it
really
when
we
consider
it
from
the
higher
point
of
view
to
which
the
divine
spirit
leads
us
his
curiosity
worldly
at
first
and
excited
by
many
vulgar
and
material
motives
purified
itself
if
he
did
not
renounce
it
altogether
the
fault
was
not
his
any
one
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
resign
an
interest
in
madame
de
la
chanterie
but
godefroid
showed
without
intending
it
a
discretion
which
was
appreciated
by
these
persons
in
whom
the
divine
spirit
had
developed
a
marvellous
power
of
the
faculties
as
indeed
it
often
does
among
recluses
the
concentration
of
the
moral
forces
no
matter
under
what
system
it
may
be
effected
increases
the
compass
of
them
tenfold
our
friend
is
not
yet
converted
said
the
good
abbe
de
veze
but
he
is
seeking
to
an
unforeseen
circumstance
brought
about
the
revelation
of
madame
de
la
chanterie
s
history
to
godefroid
and
so
fully
was
this
made
to
him
that
the
overpowering
interest
she
excited
in
his
soul
was
completely
satisfied
the
public
mind
was
at
that
time
much
occupied
by
one
of
those
horrible
criminal
trials
which
mark
the
annals
of
our
this
trial
had
gathered
its
chief
interest
from
the
character
of
the
criminals
themselves
whose
audacity
superior
intelligence
in
evil
and
cynical
replies
had
horrified
the
community
it
is
a
matter
worthy
of
remark
that
no
newspaper
ever
found
its
way
into
the
hotel
de
la
chanterie
and
godefroid
only
heard
of
the
rejection
of
the
criminals
appeal
from
his
master
in
for
the
trial
itself
had
taken
place
some
time
before
he
came
to
live
in
his
new
abode
do
you
ever
encounter
he
said
to
his
new
friends
such
atrocious
villains
as
those
men
and
if
you
do
encounter
them
how
do
you
manage
them
in
the
first
place
said
monsieur
nicolas
there
are
no
atrocious
villains
there
are
diseased
natures
to
be
cared
for
in
asylums
but
outside
of
those
rare
medical
cases
we
find
only
persons
who
are
without
religion
or
who
reason
ill
and
the
mission
of
charity
is
to
teach
them
the
right
use
of
reason
to
encourage
the
weak
and
guide
aright
those
who
go
and
said
the
abbe
de
veze
all
is
possible
to
such
teachers
for
god
is
with
if
they
were
to
send
you
those
criminals
you
could
do
nothing
with
them
could
you
asked
godefroid
the
time
would
be
too
short
remarked
monsieur
alain
in
general
said
monsieur
nicolas
persons
turn
over
to
religion
souls
which
have
reached
the
last
stages
of
evil
and
leave
it
no
time
to
do
its
work
the
criminals
of
whom
you
speak
were
men
of
remarkable
vigor
could
they
have
been
within
our
hands
in
time
they
might
have
become
distinguished
men
but
as
soon
as
they
committed
a
murder
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
interfere
they
then
belonged
to
human
that
must
mean
said
godefroid
that
you
are
against
the
penalty
of
death
monsieur
nicolas
rose
hastily
and
left
the
room
do
not
ever
mention
the
penalty
of
death
again
before
monsieur
nicolas
said
monsieur
alain
he
recognized
in
a
criminal
at
whose
execution
he
was
officially
present
his
natural
and
the
son
was
innocent
added
monsieur
joseph
madame
de
la
chanterie
who
had
been
absent
for
a
while
returned
to
the
salon
at
this
moment
but
you
must
admit
said
godefroid
addressing
monsieur
joseph
that
society
can
not
exist
without
the
death
penalty
and
that
those
persons
who
morning
will
have
their
heads
cut
godefroid
felt
his
mouth
suddenly
closed
by
a
vigorous
hand
and
he
saw
the
abbe
leading
away
madame
de
la
chanterie
in
an
almost
fainting
condition
what
have
you
done
monsieur
joseph
said
to
him
take
him
away
alain
he
added
removing
the
hand
with
which
he
had
gagged
godefroid
then
he
followed
the
abbe
de
veze
into
madame
de
la
chanterie
s
room
come
said
monsieur
alain
to
godefroid
you
have
made
it
essential
that
i
should
tell
you
the
secrets
of
madame
s
they
were
presently
sitting
in
the
old
man
s
room
well
said
godefroid
whose
face
showed
plainly
his
regret
for
having
been
the
cause
of
something
which
in
that
peaceful
home
might
be
called
a
catastrophe
i
am
waiting
till
manon
comes
to
reassure
us
replied
the
goodman
listening
to
the
steps
of
the
maid
upon
the
staircase
madame
is
better
said
manon
monsieur
l
abbe
has
deceived
her
as
to
what
was
and
she
looked
at
godefroid
angrily
good
god
cried
the
poor
fellow
in
distress
the
tears
coming
into
his
eyes
come
sit
down
said
monsieur
alain
sitting
down
himself
then
he
made
a
pause
as
if
to
gather
up
his
ideas
i
don
t
know
he
went
on
if
i
have
the
talent
to
worthily
relate
a
life
so
cruelly
tried
you
must
excuse
me
if
the
words
of
so
poor
a
speaker
as
i
are
beneath
the
level
of
its
actions
and
catastrophes
remember
that
it
is
long
since
i
left
school
and
that
i
am
the
child
of
a
century
in
which
men
cared
more
for
thought
than
for
effect
a
prosaic
century
which
knew
only
how
to
call
things
by
their
right
godefroid
made
an
acquiescing
gesture
with
an
expression
of
sincere
admiration
and
said
simply
i
am
you
have
just
had
a
proof
my
young
friend
resumed
the
old
man
that
it
is
impossible
you
should
remain
among
us
without
knowing
at
least
some
of
the
terrible
facts
in
the
life
of
that
saintly
woman
there
are
ideas
and
illusions
and
fatal
words
which
are
completely
interdicted
in
this
house
lest
they
reopen
wounds
in
madame
s
heart
and
cause
a
suffering
which
if
again
renewed
might
kill
good
god
cried
godefroid
what
have
i
done
if
monsieur
joseph
had
not
stopped
the
words
on
your
lips
you
were
about
to
speak
of
that
fatal
instrument
of
death
and
that
would
have
stricken
down
madame
de
la
chanterie
like
a
thunderbolt
it
is
time
you
should
know
all
for
you
will
really
belong
to
us
before
long
we
all
think
so
here
then
is
the
history
of
her
life
madame
de
la
chanterie
he
went
on
after
a
pause
comes
from
one
of
the
first
families
of
lower
normandy
her
maiden
name
was
mademoiselle
de
champignelles
of
the
younger
branch
of
that
house
she
was
destined
to
take
the
veil
unless
she
could
make
a
marriage
which
renounced
on
the
husband
s
side
the
dowry
her
family
could
not
give
her
this
was
frequently
the
case
in
the
families
of
poor
nobles
a
sieur
de
la
chanterie
whose
family
had
fallen
into
obscurity
though
it
dates
from
the
crusade
of
philip
augustus
was
anxious
to
recover
the
rank
and
position
which
this
ancient
lineage
properly
gave
him
in
the
province
of
normandy
this
gentleman
had
doubly
derogated
from
his
rightful
station
for
he
had
amassed
a
fortune
of
nearly
a
million
of
francs
as
purveyor
to
the
armies
of
the
king
at
the
time
of
the
war
in
hanover
the
old
man
had
a
son
and
this
son
presuming
on
his
father
s
wealth
greatly
exaggerated
by
rumor
was
leading
a
life
in
paris
that
greatly
disquieted
his
father
the
word
of
mademoiselle
de
champignelle
s
character
was
well
known
in
the
bessin
that
beautiful
region
of
lower
normandy
near
bayeux
where
the
family
lived
the
old
man
whose
little
estate
of
la
chanterie
was
between
caen
and
often
heard
regrets
expressed
before
him
that
so
perfect
a
young
girl
and
one
so
capable
of
rendering
a
husband
happy
should
be
condemned
to
pass
her
life
in
a
convent
when
on
reflection
he
expressed
a
desire
to
know
more
of
the
young
lady
the
hope
was
held
out
to
him
of
obtaining
the
hand
of
mademoiselle
philiberte
for
his
son
provided
he
would
take
her
without
dowry
he
went
to
bayeux
had
several
interviews
with
the
champignelles
s
family
and
was
completely
won
by
the
noble
qualities
of
the
young
girl
at
sixteen
years
of
age
mademoiselle
de
champignelles
gave
promise
of
what
she
would
ultimately
become
it
was
easy
to
see
in
her
a
living
piety
an
unalterable
good
sense
an
inflexible
uprightness
and
one
of
those
souls
which
never
detach
themselves
from
an
affection
under
any
compulsion
the
old
father
enriched
by
his
extortions
in
the
army
recognized
in
this
charming
girl
a
woman
who
could
restrain
his
son
by
the
power
of
virtue
and
by
the
ascendancy
of
a
nature
that
was
firm
without
rigidity
you
have
seen
her
said
monsieur
alain
pausing
in
his
narrative
and
you
know
that
no
one
can
be
gentler
than
madame
de
la
chanterie
and
also
i
may
tell
you
that
no
one
is
more
confiding
she
has
kept
even
to
her
declining
years
the
candor
and
simplicity
of
innocence
she
has
never
been
willing
to
believe
in
evil
and
the
little
mistrust
you
may
have
noticed
in
her
is
due
only
to
her
terrible
misfortunes
the
old
man
said
monsieur
alain
continuing
agreed
with
the
champignelles
family
to
give
a
receipt
for
the
legal
dower
of
mademoiselle
philiberte
this
was
necessary
in
those
days
but
in
return
the
champignelles
who
were
allied
to
many
of
the
great
families
promised
to
obtain
the
erection
of
the
little
fief
of
la
chanterie
into
a
barony
and
they
kept
their
word
the
aunt
of
the
future
husband
madame
de
boisfrelon
the
widow
of
a
parliamentary
councillor
promised
to
bequeath
her
whole
fortune
to
her
nephew
when
these
arrangements
had
been
completed
by
the
two
families
the
father
sent
for
the
son
at
this
time
the
latter
was
master
of
petitions
to
the
grand
council
he
was
years
of
age
and
had
already
lived
a
life
of
folly
with
all
the
young
seigneurs
of
the
period
in
fact
the
old
purveyor
had
been
forced
more
than
once
to
pay
his
debts
the
poor
father
foreseeing
further
follies
was
only
too
glad
to
make
a
settlement
on
his
of
a
certain
sum
and
he
entailed
the
estate
of
la
chanterie
on
the
heirs
male
of
the
marriage
but
the
revolution
said
monsieur
alain
in
a
parenthesis
made
that
last
precaution
useless
gifted
with
the
beauty
of
an
angel
he
continued
and
with
wonderful
grace
and
agility
in
all
exercises
of
the
body
the
young
master
of
petitions
possessed
the
gift
of
mademoiselle
de
champignelles
became
as
you
can
readily
believe
very
much
in
love
with
her
husband
the
old
man
delighted
with
the
outset
of
the
marriage
and
believing
in
the
reform
of
his
son
sent
the
young
couple
to
paris
all
this
happened
about
the
beginning
of
the
year
nearly
a
whole
year
of
happiness
followed
madame
de
la
chanterie
enjoyed
during
that
time
the
tenderest
care
and
the
most
delicate
attentions
that
a
man
deeply
in
love
can
bestow
upon
a
loving
woman
however
short
it
may
have
been
the
honeymoon
did
shine
into
the
heart
of
that
noble
and
most
unfortunate
woman
you
know
that
in
those
days
women
nursed
their
children
madame
de
la
chanterie
had
a
daughter
that
period
during
which
a
woman
ought
to
be
the
object
of
redoubled
care
and
tenderness
proved
in
this
case
the
beginning
of
untold
miseries
the
master
of
petitions
was
obliged
to
sell
all
the
property
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
to
pay
former
debts
which
he
had
not
acknowledged
to
his
father
and
fresh
losses
at
play
then
the
national
assembly
decreed
the
dissolution
of
the
grand
council
the
parliament
and
all
the
law
offices
so
dearly
bought
the
young
household
increased
by
a
daughter
was
soon
without
other
means
than
those
settled
upon
madame
de
la
chanterie
by
her
in
twenty
months
that
charming
woman
now
only
seventeen
and
a
half
years
old
was
obliged
to
live
she
and
the
child
she
was
nursing
in
an
obscure
quarter
and
by
the
labor
of
her
hands
she
was
then
entirely
abandoned
by
her
husband
who
fell
by
degrees
lower
and
lower
into
the
society
of
women
of
the
worst
kind
never
did
she
reproach
her
husband
never
has
she
allowed
herself
to
blame
him
she
has
sometimes
told
us
how
during
those
wretched
days
she
would
pray
for
her
dear
that
scamp
was
named
henri
said
the
worthy
man
interrupting
himself
we
never
mention
that
name
here
nor
that
of
henriette
i
resume
never
leaving
her
little
room
in
the
rue
de
la
corderie
du
temple
except
to
buy
provisions
or
to
fetch
her
work
madame
de
la
chanterie
contrived
to
get
along
thanks
to
a
hundred
francs
which
her
touched
by
her
goodness
sent
to
her
once
a
month
nevertheless
foreseeing
that
that
resource
might
fail
her
the
poor
young
woman
had
taken
up
the

a
wise
one

then
overthrown

now
one
of
the
most
ferocious
presidents
of

became
the
terror
of

his
passions

turn
after

of

him
to

madame
de

heard
of
this
through
a
letter
of
farewell
which
her
husband
wrote
to
her
instantly
giving
her
little
girl
to
the
care
of

went

the

wretch
was

with
her

were
all
that
she
owned

her
to
make
her
way
into

prison

succeeded
in
saving
her
husband
by
dressing
him
in
her
own
clothes
under
circumstances
almost
identical
with
those
which
sometime
later
were
so
serviceable
to
madame
de
la
valette
she
was
condemned
to
death
but
the
government
was
ashamed
to
carry
out
the
sentence
and
the

tribunal

one
over
which
her
husband
had
formerly
presided

at
her
escape

years
the
poor
woman
saw
her
husband

times
the
first
time
he
stayed
hours
in
the
humble
lodging
of
his
wife
and
carried
away
with
him
all
her
money
having
showered
her
with
marks
of
tenderness
and
made
her
believe
in
his
complete
conversion

not

i

daily

monsieur

an
illness
she
nursed
him

back
into
frightful
profligacy

justice
only
by
again
taking
refuge
with
his

whose
care
he
died
in

cried
the

the

was
a
married
man
two
years
after
his
death
madame
de

discovered
that
a
second
madame
de

existed
widowed
like
herself
and
like
her

found
two

incapable
of

monsieur

uncle
of
madame
de

came
to
paris
his
name
having
been
erased
from
the

and
brought
madame
the
sum
of

hundred
thousand
francs
which
her
the
old
purveyor
had
formerly
entrusted
to
him
for
the
benefit

he
persuaded
the
widow
to
return
to
normandy
where
she
completed
the
education
of

daughter
and
purchased
on
excellent
terms
and
still
by
the
advice
of
her
uncle

monsieur
alain
we
have
not
yet
reached
the
period
of
storms
and
darkness
i
resume
in
after
four
years
of
rest
and
peace
madame
de
la
chanterie
married
her
daughter
to
a
gentleman
of
rank
whose
piety
antecedents
and
fortune
offered
every
guarantee
that
could
be
given
a
man
who
to
use
a
popular
saying
was
after
every
one
s
own
heart
in
the
best
society
of
the
provincial
city
where
madame
and
her
daughter
passed
their
winters
i
should
tell
you
that
this
society
was
composed
of
seven
or
eight
families
belonging
to
the
highest
nobility
in
france
d
esgrignon
troisville
casteran
nouatre
etc
at
the
end
of
eighteen
months
the
baron
deserted
his
wife
and
disappeared
in
paris
where
he
changed
his
name
madame
de
la
chanterie
never
knew
the
causes
of
this
desertion
until
the
lightning
of
a
dreadful
storm
revealed
them
her
daughter
brought
up
with
anxious
care
and
trained
in
the
purest
religious
sentiments
kept
total
silence
as
to
her
troubles
this
lack
of
confidence
in
her
mother
was
a
painful
blow
to
madame
de
la
chanterie
already
she
had
several
times
noticed
in
her
daughter
indications
of
the
reckless
disposition
of
the
father
increased
in
the
daughter
by
an
almost
virile
strength
of
will
the
husband
however
abandoned
his
home
of
his
own
free
will
leaving
his
affairs
in
a
pitiable
condition
madame
de
la
chanterie
is
even
to
this
day
amazed
at
the
catastrophe
which
no
human
foresight
could
have
prevented
the
persons
she
prudently
consulted
before
the
marriage
had
assured
her
that
the
suitor
s
fortune
was
clear
and
sound
and
that
no
mortgages
were
on
his
estate
nevertheless
it
appeared
after
the
husband
s
departure
that
for
ten
years
his
debts
had
exceeded
the
entire
value
of
his
property
everything
was
therefore
sold
and
the
poor
young
wife
now
reduced
to
her
own
means
came
back
to
her
mother
madame
de
la
chanterie
knew
later
that
the
most
honorable
persons
of
the
province
had
vouched
for
her
in
their
own
interests
for
he
owed
them
all
large
sums
of
money
and
they
looked
upon
his
marriage
with
mademoiselle
de
la
chanterie
as
a
means
to
recover
them
there
were
however
other
reasons
for
this
catastrophe
which
you
will
find
later
in
a
confidential
paper
written
for
the
eyes
of
the
emperor
moreover
this
man
had
long
courted
the
of
the
royalist
families
by
his
devotion
to
the
royal
cause
during
the
revolution
he
was
one
of
louis
s
most
active
emissaries
and
had
taken
part
after
in
all
conspiracies
escaping
their
penalties
however
with
such
singular
adroitness
that
he
came
in
the
end
to
be
distrusted
thanked
for
his
services
by
louis
but
completely
set
aside
in
the
royalist
affairs
he
had
returned
to
live
on
his
property
now
much
encumbered
with
debt
these
antecedents
were
then
obscure
the
persons
initiated
into
the
secrets
of
the
royal
closet
kept
silence
about
so
dangerous
a
coadjutor
and
he
was
therefore
received
with
a
species
of
reverence
in
a
city
devoted
to
the
bourbons
where
the
cruellest
deeds
of
the
chouannerie
were
accepted
as
legitimate
warfare
the
d
esgrignons
casterans
the
chevalier
de
valois
in
short
the
whole
aristocracy
and
the
church
opened
their
arms
to
this
royalist
diplomat
and
drew
him
into
their
circle
their
protection
was
encouraged
by
the
desire
of
his
creditors
for
the
payment
of
his
debts
for
three
years
this
man
who
was
a
villain
at
heart
a
pendant
to
the
late
baron
de
la
chanterie
contrived
to
restrain
his
vices
and
assume
the
appearance
of
morality
and
religion
during
the
first
months
of
his
marriage
he
exerted
a
sort
of
spell
over
his
wife
he
tried
to
corrupt
her
mind
by
his
doctrines
if
it
can
be
said
that
atheism
is
a
doctrine
and
by
the
jesting
tone
in
which
he
spoke
of
sacred
principles
from
the
time
of
his
return
to
the
provinces
this
political
manoeuvrer
had
an
intimacy
with
a
young
man
overwhelmed
with
debt
like
himself
but
whose
natural
character
was
as
frank
and
courageous
as
the
baron
s
was
hypocritical
and
base
this
frequent
guest
whose
accomplishments
strong
character
and
adventurous
life
were
calculated
to
influence
a
young
girl
s
mind
was
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
the
husband
to
bring
the
wife
to
adopt
his
theories
never
did
she
let
her
mother
know
the
abyss
into
which
her
fate
had
cast
her
we
may
well
distrust
all
human
prudence
when
we
think
of
the
infinite
precautions
taken
by
madame
de
la
chanterie
in
marrying
her
only
daughter
the
blow
when
it
came
to
a
life
so
devoted
so
pure
so
truly
religious
as
that
of
a
woman
already
tested
by
many
trials
gave
madame
de
la
chanterie
a
distrust
of
herself
which
served
to
isolate
her
from
her
daughter
and
all
the
more
because
her
daughter
in
compensation
for
her
misfortunes
exacted
complete
liberty
ruled
her
mother
and
was
even
at
times
unkind
to
her
wounded
thus
in
all
her
affections
mistaken
in
her
devotion
and
love
for
her
husband
to
whom
she
had
sacrificed
without
a
word
her
happiness
her
fortune
and
her
life
mistaken
in
the
education
exclusively
religious
which
she
had
given
to
her
daughter
mistaken
in
the
confidence
she
had
placed
in
others
in
the
affair
of
her
daughter
s
marriage
and
obtaining
no
justice
from
the
heart
in
which
she
had
sown
none
but
noble
sentiments
she
united
herself
still
more
closely
to
god
as
the
hand
of
trouble
lay
heavy
upon
her
she
was
indeed
almost
a
nun
going
daily
to
church
performing
cloistral
penances
and
practising
economy
that
she
might
have
means
to
help
the
poor
could
there
be
up
to
this
point
a
saintlier
life
or
one
more
tried
than
that
of
this
noble
woman
so
gentle
under
misfortune
so
brave
in
danger
and
always
christian
said
monsieur
alain
appealing
to
godefroid
you
know
madame
now
you
know
if
she
is
wanting
in
sense
judgment
reflection
in
fact
she
has
those
qualities
to
the
highest
degree
well
the
misfortunes
i
have
now
told
you
which
might
be
said
to
make
her
life
surpass
all
others
in
adversity
are
as
nothing
to
those
that
were
still
in
store
for
this
poor
woman
but
now
let
us
concern
ourselves
exclusively
with
madame
de
la
chanterie
s
daughter
said
the
old
man
resuming
his
narrative
at
eighteen
years
of
age
the
period
of
her
marriage
mademoiselle
de
la
chanterie
was
a
young
girl
of
delicate
complexion
brown
in
tone
with
a
brilliant
color
graceful
in
shape
and
very
pretty
above
a
forehead
of
great
beauty
was
a
mass
of
dark
hair
which
harmonized
with
the
brown
eyes
and
the
general
gaiety
of
her
expression
a
certain
daintiness
of
feature
was
misleading
as
to
her
true
character
and
her
almost
virile
decision
she
had
small
hands
and
small
feet
in
fact
there
was
something
fragile
about
her
whole
person
which
excluded
the
idea
of
vigor
and
determination
having
always
lived
beside
her
mother
she
had
a
most
perfect
innocence
of
thought
and
behavior
and
a
really
remarkable
piety
this
young
girl
like
her
mother
was
fanatically
attached
to
the
bourbons
she
was
therefore
a
bitter
enemy
to
the
revolution
and
regarded
the
dominion
of
napoleon
as
a
curse
inflicted
by
providence
upon
france
in
punishment
of
the
crimes
of
the
conformity
of
opinion
on
this
subject
between
madame
de
la
chanterie
and
her
daughter
and
the
daughter
s
suitor
was
one
of
the
determining
reasons
of
the
marriage
the
friend
of
the
husband
had
commanded
a
body
of
chouans
at
the
time
that
hostilities
were
renewed
in
and
it
seems
that
the
baron
s
object
madame
de
la
chanterie
s
was
a
baron
in
fostering
the
intimacy
between
his
wife
and
his
friend
was
to
obtain
through
her
influence
certain
succor
from
that
friend
this
requires
a
few
words
of
explanation
said
monsieur
alain
interrupting
his
narrative
about
an
association
which
in
those
days
made
a
great
deal
of
noise
i
mean
the
every
province
in
the
west
of
france
was
at
that
time
more
or
less
overrun
with
these
brigands
whose
object
was
far
less
pillage
than
a
resurrection
of
the
royalist
warfare
they
profited
so
it
was
said
by
the
great
number
of
refractories
the
name
applied
to
those
who
evaded
the
conscription
which
was
at
that
time
as
you
probably
know
enforced
to
actual
abuse
this
name
applies
to
royalists
who
robbed
the
conveying
government
funds
and
levied
tribute
on
those
who
bought
the
confiscated
property
of
at
the
west
when
the
thermidorian
reaction
began
after
the
fall
of
robespierre
other
companies
of
royalists
chiefly
young
nobles
who
had
not
emigrated
were
formed
at
the
south
and
east
under
various
names
such
as
the
avengers
and
the
company
of
jehu
who
stopped
the
diligences
containing
government
money
which
they
transmitted
to
brittany
and
la
vendee
for
the
support
of
the
royalist
troops
they
regarded
this
as
legitimate
warfare
and
were
scrupulous
not
to
touch
private
property
when
captured
however
they
were
tried
and
executed
as
tr
between
mortagne
and
rennes
and
even
beyond
as
far
as
the
banks
of
the
loire
nocturnal
expeditions
were
organized
which
attacked
especially
in
normandy
the
holders
of
property
bought
from
the
national
domain
these
armed
bands
sent
terror
throughout
those
regions
i
am
not
misleading
you
when
i
ask
you
to
observe
that
in
certain
departments
the
action
of
the
laws
was
for
a
long
time
paralyzed
the
national
domain
was
the
name
given
to
the
confiscated
property
of
the
which
was
sold
from
time
to
time
at
auction
to
the
highest
tr
these
last
echoes
of
the
civil
war
made
much
less
noise
than
you
would
imagine
accustomed
as
we
are
now
to
the
frightful
publicity
given
by
the
press
to
every
trial
even
the
least
important
whether
political
or
individual
the
system
of
the
imperial
government
was
that
of
all
absolute
governments
the
censor
allowed
nothing
to
be
published
in
the
matter
of
politics
except
accomplished
facts
and
those
were
travestied
if
you
will
take
the
trouble
to
look
through
files
of
the
moniteur
and
the
other
newspapers
of
that
time
even
those
of
the
west
you
will
not
find
a
word
about
the
four
or
five
criminal
trials
which
cost
the
lives
of
sixty
or
eighty
the
term
applied
during
the
revolutionary
period
to
the
vendeans
chouans
and
all
those
who
took
up
arms
for
the
house
of
bourbon
was
afterwards
continued
judicially
under
the
empire
against
all
royalists
accused
of
plots
to
some
ardent
and
loyal
natures
the
emperor
and
his
government
were
the
enemy
any
form
of
warfare
against
them
was
legitimate
i
am
only
explaining
to
you
these
opinions
not
justifying
them
now
he
said
after
one
of
those
pauses
which
are
necessary
in
such
long
narratives
if
you
realize
how
these
royalists
ruined
by
the
civil
war
of
were
dominated
by
violent
passions
and
how
some
exceptional
natures
like
that
of
madame
de
la
chanterie
s
and
his
friend
were
eaten
up
with
desires
of
all
kinds
you
may
be
able
to
understand
how
it
was
that
the
acts
of
brigandage
which
their
political
views
justified
when
employed
against
the
government
in
the
service
of
the
good
cause
might
in
some
cases
be
committed
for
personal
ends
the
younger
of
the
two
men
had
been
for
some
time
employed
in
collecting
the
scattered
fragments
of
chouannerie
and
was
holding
them
ready
to
act
at
an
opportune
moment
there
came
a
terrible
crisis
in
the
emperor
s
career
when
shut
up
in
the
island
of
lobau
he
seemed
about
to
give
way
under
the
combined
and
simultaneous
attack
of
england
and
austria
this
was
the
moment
for
the
chouan
uprising
but
just
as
it
was
about
to
take
place
the
victory
of
wagram
rendered
the
conspiracy
in
the
provinces
powerless
this
expectation
of
exciting
civil
war
in
brittany
la
vendee
and
part
of
normandy
coincided
in
time
with
the
final
wreck
of
the
baron
s
fortune
and
this
wreck
coming
at
this
time
led
him
to
undertake
an
expedition
to
capture
funds
of
the
government
which
he
might
apply
to
the
liquidation
of
the
claims
upon
his
property
but
his
wife
and
friend
refused
to
take
part
in
applying
to
private
interests
the
money
taken
by
armed
force
from
the
receiver
s
offices
and
the
couriers
and
of
the
government
money
taken
as
they
thought
justifiably
by
the
rules
of
war
to
pay
the
regiments
of
refractories
and
chouans
and
purchase
the
arms
and
ammunition
with
which
to
equip
them
at
last
after
an
angry
discussion
in
which
the
young
leader
supported
by
the
wife
positively
refused
to
hand
over
to
the
husband
a
portion
of
the
large
sum
of
money
which
the
young
leader
had
seized
for
the
benefit
of
the
royal
armies
from
the
treasury
of
the
west
the
baron
suddenly
and
mysteriously
disappeared
to
avoid
arrest
for
debt
having
no
means
left
by
which
to
ward
it
off
poor
madame
de
la
chanterie
was
wholly
ignorant
of
these
facts
but
even
they
are
nothing
to
the
plot
still
hidden
behind
these
preliminary
facts
it
is
too
late
said
monsieur
alain
looking
at
his
little
clock
to
go
on
with
my
narrative
which
would
take
me
in
any
case
a
long
time
to
finish
in
my
own
words
old
bordin
my
friend
whose
management
of
the
famous
simeuse
case
had
won
him
much
credit
in
the
royalist
party
and
who
pleaded
in
the
criminal
affair
called
that
of
the
chauffeurs
de
mortagne
gave
me
after
i
was
installed
in
this
house
two
legal
papers
relating
to
the
terrible
history
of
madame
de
la
chanterie
and
her
daughter
i
kept
them
because
bordin
died
soon
after
before
i
had
a
chance
to
return
them
you
shall
read
them
you
will
find
the
facts
much
more
succinctly
stated
than
i
could
state
them
those
facts
are
so
numerous
that
i
should
only
lose
myself
in
the
details
and
confuse
them
whereas
in
those
papers
you
have
them
in
a
legal
summary
if
you
come
to
me
i
will
finish
telling
you
all
that
relates
to
madame
de
la
chanterie
for
you
will
then
know
the
general
facts
so
thoroughly
that
i
can
end
the
whole
story
in
a
few
ix
the
legal
statement
monsieur
alain
placed
the
papers
yellowed
by
time
in
godefroid
s
hand
the
latter
bidding
the
old
man
carried
them
off
to
his
room
where
he
read
before
he
slept
the
following
document
the
indictment
court
of
criminal
and
special
justice
for
the
department
of
the
orne
the
to
the
imperial
court
of
caen
appointed
to
fulfil
his
functions
before
the
special
criminal
court
established
by
imperial
decree
under
date
september
and
sitting
at
alencon
states
to
the
imperial
court
the
following
facts
which
have
appeared
under
the
above
procedure
the
plot
of
a
company
of
brigands
evidently
long
planned
with
consummate
care
and
connected
with
a
scheme
for
inciting
the
western
departments
to
revolt
has
shown
itself
in
certain
attempts
against
the
private
property
of
citizens
but
more
especially
in
an
armed
attack
and
robbery
committed
on
the
which
transported
may
the
money
in
the
treasury
at
caen
to
the
treasury
of
france
this
attack
which
recalls
the
deplorable
incidents
of
a
civil
war
now
happily
extinguished
manifests
a
spirit
of
wickedness
which
the
political
passions
of
the
present
day
do
not
justify
let
us
pass
to
the
facts
the
plot
is
complicated
the
details
are
numerous
the
investigation
has
lasted
one
year
but
the
evidence
which
has
followed
the
crime
step
by
step
has
thrown
the
clearest
light
on
its
preparation
execution
and
results
the
conception
of
the
plot
was
formed
by
one
rifoel
calling
himself
chevalier
du
vissard
born
at
the
vissard
district
of
near
ernee
and
a
former
leader
of
the
rebels
this
criminal
whom
the
emperor
and
king
pardoned
at
the
time
of
the
general
pacification
and
who
has
profited
by
the
sovereign
s
magnanimity
to
commit
other
crimes
has
already
paid
on
the
scaffold
the
penalty
of
his
many
misdeeds
but
it
is
necessary
to
recall
some
of
his
actions
because
his
influence
was
great
on
the
guilty
persons
now
before
the
court
and
he
is
closely
connected
with
the
facts
of
his
case
this
dangerous
agitator
concealed
according
to
the
usual
custom
of
the
rebels
under
the
name
of
pierrot
went
from
place
to
place
throughout
the
departments
of
the
west
gathering
together
the
elements
of
rebellion
but
his
chief
resort
was
the
chateau
of
the
residence
of
a
madame
lechantre
and
her
daughter
a
madame
bryond
situated
in
the
district
of
arrondissement
of
mortagne
several
of
the
most
horrible
events
of
the
rebellion
of
are
connected
with
this
strategic
point
here
a
bearer
of
despatches
was
murdered
his
carriage
pillaged
by
the
brigands
under
command
of
a
woman
assisted
by
the
notorious
brigandage
appeared
to
be
endemic
in
that
locality
an
intimacy
which
we
shall
not
attempt
to
characterize
existed
for
more
than
a
year
between
the
woman
bryond
and
the
said
rifoel
it
was
in
this
district
that
an
interview
took
place
in
april
between
rifoel
and
a
certain
boislaurier
a
leader
known
by
the
name
of
august
in
the
baneful
rebellions
of
the
west
who
instigated
the
affair
now
before
the
court
the
somewhat
obscure
point
of
the
relations
between
these
two
leaders
is
cleared
up
by
the
testimony
of
numerous
witnesses
and
also
by
the
judgment
of
the
court
which
condemned
rifoel
from
that
time
boislaurier
had
an
understanding
with
rifoel
and
they
acted
in
concert
they
communicated
to
each
other
at
first
secretly
their
infamous
plans
encouraged
by
the
absence
of
his
imperial
and
royal
majesty
with
the
armies
in
spain
their
scheme
was
to
obtain
possession
of
the
money
of
the
treasury
as
the
fundamental
basis
of
future
operations
some
time
after
this
one
named
dubut
of
caen
sent
an
emissary
to
the
chateau
of
named
hiley
commonly
called
the
laborer
long
known
as
a
highwayman
a
robber
of
diligences
to
give
information
as
to
the
men
who
could
safely
be
relied
upon
it
was
thus
by
means
of
hiley
that
the
plotters
obtained
from
the
beginning
the
of
one
herbomez
otherwise
called
general
hardi
a
former
rebel
of
the
same
stamp
as
rifoel
and
like
him
faithless
to
his
pledges
under
the
amnesty
herbomez
and
hiley
recruited
from
the
surrounding
districts
seven
brigands
whose
names
are
jean
cibot
called
one
of
the
boldest
brigands
of
the
corps
formed
by
montauran
in
the
year
and
a
participator
in
the
attack
upon
the

one
of
the
confederates
of

quiberon
cabot
called

former
huntsman
to
the

refractory
these
confederates
were
lodged
in
three
different
districts
in
the
houses
of
the
following
named
persons
binet
melin
and
laraviniere
innkeepers
or
publicans
and
all
devoted
to
rifoel
the
necessary
arms
were
supplied
by
one
leveille
notary
an
incorrigible
assistant
of
the
brigands
and
their
with
certain
hidden
leaders
also
by
one
felix
courceuil
commonly
called
confesseur
former
surgeon
of
the
rebel
armies
of
la
vendee
both
these
men
are
from
alencon
eleven
muskets
were
hidden
in
a
house
belonging
to
the
sieur
bryond
in
the
faubourg
of
alencon
where
they
were
placed
without
his
knowledge
when
the
sieur
bryond
left
his
wife
to
pursue
the
fatal
course
she
had
chosen
these
muskets
mysteriously
taken
from
the
said
house
were
transported
by
the
woman
bryond
in
her
own
carriage
to
the
chateau
of
it
was
then
that
the
acts
of
brigandage
in
the
department
of
the
orne
and
the
adjacent
departments
took
place
acts
that
amazed
both
the
authorities
and
the
inhabitants
of
those
regions
which
had
long
been
entirely
pacificated
acts
moreover
which
proved
that
these
odious
enemies
of
the
government
and
the
french
empire
were
in
the
secret
of
the
coalition
of
through
communication
with
the
royalist
party
in
foreign
countries
the
notary
leveille
the
woman
bryond
dubut
of
caen
herbomez
of
mayenne
boislaurier
of
mans
and
rifoel
were
therefore
the
heads
of
the
association
which
was
composed
of
certain
guilty
persons
already
condemned
to
death
and
executed
with
rifoel
certain
others
who
are
the
accused
persons
at
present
under
trial
and
a
number
more
who
have
escaped
just
punishment
by
flight
or
by
the
silence
of
their
accomplices
it
was
dubut
who
living
near
caen
notified
the
notary
leveille
when
the
government
money
contained
in
the
local
would
be
despatched
to
the
treasury
we
must
remark
here
that
after
the
time
of
the
removal
of
the
muskets
leveille
who
went
to
see
bruce
grenier
and
cibot
in
the
house
of
melin
found
them
hiding
the
muskets
in
a
shed
on
the
premises
and
himself
assisted
in
the
operation
a
general
rendezvous
was
arranged
to
take
place
at
mortagne
in
the
hotel
de
l
ecu
de
france
all
the
accused
persons
were
present
under
various
disguises
it
was
then
that
leveille
the
woman
bryond
dubut
herbomez
boislaurier
and
hiley
the
ablest
of
the
secondary
accomplices
as
cibot
was
the
boldest
obtained
the
of
one
vauthier
called
a
former
servant
of
the
famous
longuy
and
now
hostler
of
the
hotel
vauthier
agreed
to
notify
the
woman
bryond
of
the
arrival
and
departure
of
the
diligence
bearing
the
government
money
which
always
stopped
for
a
time
at
the
hotel
the
woman
bryond
collected
the
scattered
brigands
at
the
chateau
de
a
few
miles
from
mortagne
where
she
had
lived
with
her
mother
since
the
separation
from
her
husband
the
brigands
with
hiley
at
their
head
stayed
at
the
chateau
for
several
days
the
woman
bryond
assisted
by
her
maid
godard
prepared
with
her
own
hands
the
food
of
these
men
she
had
already
filled
a
loft
with
hay
and
there
the
provisions
were
taken
to
them
while
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
government
money
these
brigands
made
nightly
sorties
from
and
the
whole
region
was
alarmed
by
their
depredations
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
outrages
committed
at
la
sartiniere
at
vonay
and
at
the
chateau
of
were
committed
by
this
band
whose
boldness
equals
their
criminality
though
they
were
able
to
so
terrify
their
victims
that
the
latter
have
kept
silence
and
the
authorities
have
been
unable
to
obtain
any
testimony
from
them
while
thus
putting
under
contribution
those
persons
in
the
neighborhood
who
had
purchased
lands
of
the
national
domain
these
brigands
carefully
explored
the
forest
of
chesnay
which
they
selected
as
the
theatre
of
their
crime
not
far
from
this
forest
is
the
village
of
louvigney
an
inn
is
kept
there
by
the
brothers
chaussard
formerly
on
the
troisville
estate
which
inn
was
made
the
final
rendezvous
of
the
brigands
these
brothers
knew
beforehand
the
part
they
were
to
play
in
the
affair
courceuil
and
boislaurier
had
long
made
overtures
to
them
to
revive
their
hatred
against
the
government
of
our
august
emperor
telling
them
that
among
the
guests
who
would
be
sent
to
them
would
be
certain
men
of
their
acquaintance
the
dreaded
hiley
and
the
not
less
dreaded
cibot
accordingly
on
the
the
seven
bandits
under
hiley
arrived
at
the
inn
of
the
brothers
chaussard
and
there
they
spent
two
days
on
the
hiley
led
off
his
men
saying
they
were
going
to
a
palace
about
nine
miles
distant
and
asking
the
brothers
to
send
provisions
for
them
to
a
certain
fork
in
the
road
not
far
distant
from
the
village
hiley
himself
returned
and
slept
at
the
inn
two
persons
on
horseback
who
were
undoubtedly
rifoel
and
the
woman
bryond
for
it
is
stated
that
this
woman
accompanied
rifoel
on
these
expeditions
on
horseback
and
dressed
as
a
man
arrived
during
the
evening
and
conversed
with
hiley
the
next
day
hiley
wrote
a
letter
to
the
notary
leveille
which
one
of
the
chaussard
brothers
took
to
the
latter
bringing
back
his
answer
two
hours
later
rifoel
and
the
woman
bryond
returned
and
had
an
interview
with
hiley
it
was
then
found
necessary
to
obtain
an
axe
to
open
as
we
shall
see
the
cases
containing
the
money
the
notary
went
with
the
woman
bryond
to
where
they
searched
in
vain
for
an
axe
the
notary
returned
alone
half
way
back
he
met
hiley
to
whom
he
stated
that
they
could
not
obtain
an
axe
hiley
returned
to
the
inn
where
he
ordered
supper
for
ten
persons
seven
of
them
being
the
brigands
who
had
now
returned
fully
armed
hiley
made
them
stack
their
arms
in
the
military
manner
they
then
sat
down
to
table
and
supped
in
haste
hiley
ordered
provisions
prepared
to
take
away
with
him
then
he
took
the
elder
chaussard
aside
and
asked
him
for
an
axe
the
innkeeper
who
if
we
believe
him
was
surprised
refused
to
give
one
courceuil
and
boislaurier
arrived
the
night
wore
on
the
three
men
walked
the
floor
of
their
room
discussing
the
plot
courceuil
called
confesseur
the
most
wily
of
the
party
obtained
an
axe
and
about
two
in
the
morning
they
all
went
away
by
different
paths
every
moment
was
of
value
the
execution
of
the
crime
was
fixed
for
that
night
hiley
courceuil
and
boislaurier
led
and
placed
their
men
hiley
hid
in
ambush
with
minard
cabot
and
bruce
at
the
right
of
the
chesnay
forest
boislaurier
grenier
and
horeau
took
the
centre
courceuil
herbomez
and
lisieux
occupied
the
ravine
to
the
left
of
the
wood
all
these
positions
are
indicated
on
the
drawn
by
the
engineer
of
the
government
which
is
here
subjoined
the
diligence
which
had
left
mortagne
about
one
in
the
morning
was
driven
by
one
rousseau
whose
conduct
proved
so
suspicious
that
his
arrest
was
judged
necessary
the
vehicle
driven
slowly
would
arrive
about
three
o
clock
in
the
forest
of
chesnay
a
single
gendarme
accompanied
the
diligence
which
would
stop
for
breakfast
at
donnery
three
passengers
only
were
making
the
trip
and
were
now
walking
up
the
hill
with
the
gendarme
the
driver
who
had
driven
very
slowly
to
the
bridge
of
chesnay
at
the
entrance
of
the
wood
now
hastened
his
horses
with
a
vigor
and
eagerness
remarked
by
the
passengers
and
turned
into
a
called
the
road
of
senzey
the
carriage
was
thus
out
of
sight
and
the
gendarme
with
the
three
young
men
were
hurrying
to
overtake
it
when
they
heard
a
shout
halt
and
four
shots
were
fired
at
them
the
gendarme
who
was
not
hit
drew
his
sabre
and
rushed
in
the
direction
of
the
vehicle
he
was
stopped
by
four
armed
men
who
fired
at
him
his
eagerness
saved
him
for
he
ran
toward
one
of
the
three
passengers
to
tell
him
to
make
for
chesnay
and
ring
the
tocsin
but
two
brigands
followed
him
and
one
of
them
taking
aim
sent
a
ball
through
his
left
shoulder
which
broke
his
arm
and
he
fell
helpless
the
shouts
and
firing
were
heard
in
donnery
a
corporal
stationed
there
and
one
gendarme
ran
toward
the
sounds
the
firing
of
a
squad
of
men
took
them
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
wood
to
that
where
the
pillage
was
taking
place
the
noise
of
the
firing
prevented
the
corporal
from
hearing
the
cries
of
the
wounded
gendarme
but
he
did
distinguish
a
sound
which
proved
to
be
that
of
an
axe
breaking
and
chopping
into
cases
he
ran
toward
the
sound
meeting
four
armed
bandits
he
called
out
to
them
surrender
villains
they
replied
stay
where
you
are
or
you
are
a
dead
man
the
corporal
sprang
forward
two
shots
were
fired
and
one
struck
him
a
ball
went
through
his
left
leg
and
into
the
flank
of
his
horse
the
brave
man
bathed
in
blood
was
forced
to
give
up
the
unequal
fight
he
shouted
help
the
brigands
are
at
chesnay
but
all
in
vain
the
robbers
masters
of
the
ground
thanks
to
their
numbers
ransacked
the
coach
they
had
gagged
and
bound
the
driver
by
way
of
deception
the
cases
were
opened
the
bags
of
money
were
thrown
out
the
horses
were
unharnessed
and
the
silver
and
gold
loaded
on
their
backs
three
thousand
francs
in
copper
were
rejected
but
a
sum
in
other
coin
of
one
hundred
and
three
thousand
francs
was
safely
carried
off
on
the
four
horses
the
brigands
took
the
road
to
the
hamlet
of
menneville
which
is
close
to
they
stopped
with
their
plunder
at
an
isolated
house
belonging
to
the
chaussard
brothers
where
the
chaussards
uncle
one
bourget
lived
who
was
knowing
to
the
whole
plot
from
its
inception
this
old
man
aided
by
his
wife
welcomed
the
brigands
charged
them
to
make
no
noise
unloaded
the
bags
of
money
and
gave
the
men
something
to
drink
the
wife
performed
the
part
of
sentinel
the
old
man
then
took
the
horses
through
the
wood
returned
them
to
the
driver
unbound
the
latter
and
also
the
young
men
who
had
been
garotted
after
resting
for
a
time
courceuil
hiley
and
boislaurier
paid
their
men
a
paltry
sum
for
their
trouble
and
the
whole
band
departed
leaving
the
plunder
in
charge
of
bourget
when
they
reached
a
lonely
place
called
these
criminals
obeying
the
impulse
which
leads
all
malefactors
into
the
blunders
and
miscalculations
of
crime
threw
their
guns
into
a
this
action
done
by
all
of
them
is
a
proof
of
their
mutual
understanding
struck
with
terror
at
the
boldness
of
their
act
and
even
by
its
success
they
dispersed
the
robbery
now
having
been
committed
with
the
additional
features
of
assault
and
assassination
other
facts
and
other
actors
appear
all
connected
with
the
robbery
itself
and
with
the
disposition
of
the
plunder
rifoel
concealed
in
paris
whence
he
pulled
every
wire
of
the
plot
transmits
to
leveille
an
order
to
send
him
instantly
fifty
thousand
francs
courceuil
knowing
to
all
the
facts
sends
hiley
to
tell
leveille
of
the
success
of
the
attempt
and
say
that
he
will
meet
him
at
mortagne
leveille
goes
there
vauthier
on
whose
fidelity
they
think
they
can
rely
agrees
to
go
to
bourget
the
uncle
of
the
chaussards
in
whose
care
the
money
was
left
and
ask
for
the
booty
the
old
man
tells
vauthier
that
he
must
go
to
his
nephews
who
have
taken
large
sums
to
the
woman
bryond
but
he
orders
him
to
wait
outside
in
the
road
and
brings
him
a
bag
containing
the
small
sum
of
twelve
hundred
francs
which
vauthier
delivers
to
the
woman
lechantre
for
her
daughter
at
leveille
s
request
vauthier
returns
to
bourget
who
this
time
sends
for
his
nephews
the
elder
chaussard
takes
vauthier
to
the
wood
shows
him
a
tree
and
there
they
find
a
bag
of
one
thousand
francs
buried
in
the
earth
leveille
hiley
and
vauthier
make
other
trips
obtaining
only
trifling
sums
compared
with
the
large
sum
known
to
have
been
captured
the
woman
lechantre
receives
these
sums
at
mortagne
and
on
receipt
of
a
letter
from
her
daughter
removes
them
to
where
the
woman
bryond
now
returns
this
is
not
the
moment
to
examine
as
to
whether
the
woman
lechantre
had
any
anterior
knowledge
of
the
plot
it
suffices
here
to
note
that
this
woman
left
mortagne
to
go
to
the
evening
before
the
crime
that
after
the
crime
she
met
her
daughter
on
the
and
they
both
returned
to
mortagne
that
on
the
following
day
leveille
informed
by
hiley
of
the
success
of
the
plot
goes
from
alencon
to
mortagne
and
there
visits
the
two
women
later
he
persuades
them
to
deposit
the
sums
obtained
with
such
difficulty
from
the
chaussards
and
bourget
in
a
house
in
alencon
of
which
we
shall
speak
presently
that
of
the
sieur
pannier
merchant
the
woman
lechantre
writes
to
the
bailiff
at
to
come
and
drive
her
and
her
daughter
by
the
towards
alencon
the
funds
now
in
their
possession
amount
to
twenty
thousand
francs
these
the
girl
godard
puts
into
the
carriage
at
night
the
notary
leveille
had
given
exact
instructions
the
two
women
reach
alencon
and
stop
at
the
house
of
a
confederate
one
louis
chargegrain
in
the
littray
district
despite
all
the
precautions
of
the
notary
who
came
there
to
meet
the
women
witnesses
were
at
hand
who
saw
the
portmanteaux
and
bags
containing
the
money
taken
from
the
carriole
at
the
moment
when
courceuil
and
hiley
disguised
as
women
were
consulting
in
the
square
at
alencon
with
the
sieur
pannier
treasurer
of
the
rebels
since
and
devoted
to
rifoel
as
to
the
best
means
of
conveying
to
rifoel
the
sum
he
asked
for
the
woman
lechantre
became
alarmed
on
hearing
at
the
inn
where
she
stopped
of
the
suspicions
and
arrests
already
made
she
fled
during
the
night
taking
her
daughter
with
her
through
the
byways
and
to
in
order
to
take
refuge
if
necessary
in
certain
prepared
at
the
chateau
de
courceuil
boislaurier
and
his
relation
dubut
clandestinely
changed
two
thousand
francs
in
silver
money
for
gold
and
fled
to
brittany
and
england
on
arriving
at
the
women
lechantre
and
bryond
heard
of
the
arrest
of
bourget
that
of
the
driver
of
the
diligence
and
that
of
the
two
refractories
the
magistrates
and
the
gendarmerie
struck
such
sure
blows
that
it
was
thought
advisable
to
place
the
woman
bryond
beyond
the
reach
of
human
justice
for
she
appears
to
have
been
an
object
of
great
devotion
on
the
part
of
these
criminals
who
were
captivated
by
her
she
left
and
was
hidden
at
first
in
alencon
where
her
followers
deliberated
and
finally
placed
her
in
the
cellar
of
pannier
s
house
here
new
incidents
develop
themselves
after
the
arrest
of
bourget
and
his
wife
the
chaussards
refuse
to
give
up
any
more
of
the
money
declaring
themselves
betrayed
this
unexpected
refusal
was
given
at
a
moment
when
an
urgent
want
of
money
was
felt
among
the
accomplices
if
only
for
the
purposes
of
escape
rifoel
was
always
clamorous
for
money
hiley
cibot
and
leveille
began
to
suspect
the
chaussards
here
comes
in
a
new
incident
which
calls
for
the
rigor
of
the
law
two
gendarmes
detailed
to
discover
the
woman
bryond
succeeded
in
tracking
her
to
pannier
s
there
a
discussion
is
held
and
these
men
unworthy
of
the
trust
reposed
in
them
instead
of
arresting
the
woman
bryond
succumb
to
her
seductions
these
unworthy
soldiers
named
ratel
and
mallet
showed
this
woman
the
utmost
interest
and
offered
to
take
her
to
the
chaussards
and
force
them
to
make
restitution
the
woman
bryond
starts
on
horseback
disguised
as
a
man
accompanied
by
ratel
mallet
and
the
girl
godard
she
makes
the
journey
by
night
she
has
a
conference
alone
with
one
of
the
brothers
chaussard
an
excited
conference
she
is
armed
with
a
pistol
and
threatens
to
blow
out
the
brains
of
her
accomplice
if
he
refuses
the
money
then
he
goes
with
her
into
the
forest
and
they
return
with
a
heavy
bag
of
coin
in
the
bag
are
copper
coins
and
silver
pieces
to
the
amount
of
fifteen
hundred
francs
when
the
woman
bryond
returns
to
alencon
the
accomplices
propose
to
go
in
a
body
to
the
chaussards
house
and
torture
them
until
they
deliver
up
the
whole
sum
when
pannier
hears
of
this
failure
he
is
furious
he
threatens
the
woman
bryond
though
threatening
him
in
return
with
rifoel
s
wrath
is
forced
to
fly
these
facts
rest
on
the
confession
of
ratel
mallet
pitying
the
woman
bryond
s
position
offers
her
an
asylum
then
mallet
and
ratel
accompanied
by
hiley
and
cibot
go
at
night
to
the
brothers
chaussard
this
time
they
find
these
brothers
have
left
the
place
and
have
taken
the
rest
of
the
money
with
them
this
was
the
last
effort
of
the
accomplices
to
recover
the
proceeds
of
the
robbery
it
now
becomes
necessary
to
show
the
exact
part
taken
by
each
of
the
actors
in
this
crime
dubut
boislaurier
herbomez
courceuil
and
hiley
were
the
ringleaders
some
deliberated
and
planned
others
acted
boislaurier
dubut
and
courceuil
all
three
fugitives
from
justice
and
outlawed
are
addicted
to
rebellion
fomenters
of
trouble
implacable
enemies
of
napoleon
the
great
his
victories
his
dynasty
and
his
government
haters
of
our
new
laws
and
of
the
constitution
of
the
empire
herbomez
and
hiley
audaciously
executed
that
which
the
three
former
planned
the
guilt
of
the
seven
instruments
of
the
crime
namely
cibot
lisieux
grenier
bruce
horeau
cabot
and
minard
is
evident
it
appears
from
the
confessions
of
those
of
them
who
are
now
in
the
hands
of
justice
lisieux
died
during
the
investigation
and
bruce
has
fled
the
country
the
conduct
of
rousseau
who
drove
the
coach
marks
him
as
an
accomplice
his
slow
method
of
driving
his
haste
at
the
entrance
of
the
wood
his
persistent
declaration
that
his
head
was
covered
whereas
the
passengers
testify
that
the
leader
of
the
brigands
told
him
to
take
the
handkerchief
off
his
head
and
recognize
them
all
these
facts
are
strong
presumptive
evidence
of
collusion
as
for
the
woman
bryond
and
the
notary
leveille
could
any
be
more
connected
more
continuous
than
theirs
they
repeatedly
furnished
means
for
the
crime
they
were
privy
to
it
and
they
abetted
it
leveille
travelled
constantly
the
woman
bryond
invented
scheme
after
scheme
she
risked
all
even
her
life
to
recover
the
plunder
she
lent
her
house
her
carriage
her
hand
is
seen
in
the
plot
from
the
beginning
she
did
not
dissuade
the
chief
leader
of
all
rifoel
since
executed
although
through
her
guilty
influence
upon
him
she
might
have
done
so
she
made
her
the
girl
godard
an
accomplice
as
for
leveille
he
took
an
active
part
in
the
actual
perpetration
of
the
crime
by
seeking
the
axe
the
brigands
asked
for
the
woman
bourget
vauthier
the
chaussards
pannier
the
woman
lechantre
mallet
and
ratel
all
participated
in
the
crime
in
their
several
degrees
as
did
the
innkeepers
melin
binet
laraviniere
and
chargegrain
bourget
has
died
during
the
investigation
after
making
a
confession
which
removes
all
doubt
as
to
the
part
played
by
vauthier
and
the
woman
bryond
if
he
attempted
to
extenuate
that
of
his
wife
and
his
nephews
chaussard
his
motives
are
easy
to
understand
the
chaussards
knowingly
fed
and
lodged
the
brigands
they
saw
them
armed
they
witnessed
all
their
arrangements
and
knew
the
object
of
them
and
lastly
they
received
the
plunder
which
they
hid
and
as
it
appears
stole
from
their
accomplices
pannier
the
former
treasurer
of
the
rebels
concealed
the
woman
bryond
in
his
house
he
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
accomplices
of
this
crime
which
he
knew
from
its
inception
in
him
certain
mysterious
relations
which
are
still
obscure
took
their
rise
the
authorities
now
have
these
matters
under
investigation
pannier
was
the
right
hand
of
rifoel
the
depositary
of
the
secrets
of
the
party
of
the
west
he
regretted
that
rifoel
introduced
women
into
the
plot
and
confided
in
them
it
was
he
who
received
the
stolen
money
from
the
woman
bryond
and
conveyed
it
to
rifoel
as
for
the
conduct
of
the
two
gendarmes
ratel
and
mallet
it
deserves
the
severest
penalty
of
the
law
they
betrayed
their
duty
one
of
them
foreseeing
his
fate
committed
suicide
but
not
until
he
had
made
important
revelations
the
other
mallet
denies
nothing
his
tacit
admissions
preclude
all
doubt
especially
as
to
the
guilt
of
the
woman
bryond
the
woman
lechantre
in
spite
of
her
constant
denials
was
privy
to
all
the
hypocrisy
of
this
woman
who
attempts
to
shelter
her
assumed
innocence
under
the
mask
of
a
false
piety
has
certain
antecedents
which
prove
her
decision
of
character
and
her
intrepidity
in
extreme
cases
she
alleges
that
she
was
misled
by
her
daughter
and
believed
that
the
plundered
money
belonged
to
the
sieur
bryond
a
common
excuse
if
the
sieur
bryond
had
possessed
any
property
he
would
not
have
left
the
department
on
account
of
his
debts
the
woman
lechantre
claims
that
she
did
not
suspect
a
shameful
theft
because
she
saw
the
proceedings
approved
by
her
ally
boislaurier
but
how
does
she
explain
the
presence
of
rifoel
already
executed
at
the
journeys
to
and
fro
the
relations
of
that
young
man
with
her
daughter
the
stay
of
the
brigands
at
where
they
were
served
by
her
daughter
and
the
girl
godard
she
alleges
sleep
declares
it
to
be
her
practice
to
go
to
bed
at
seven
in
the
evening
and
has
no
answer
to
make
when
the
magistrate
points
out
to
her
that
if
she
rises
as
she
says
she
does
at
dawn
she
must
have
seen
some
signs
of
the
plot
of
the
sojourn
of
so
many
persons
and
of
the
nocturnal
goings
and
comings
of
her
daughter
to
this
she
replies
that
she
was
occupied
in
prayer
this
woman
is
a
mass
of
hypocrisy
lastly
her
journey
on
the
day
of
the
crime
the
care
she
takes
to
carry
her
daughter
to
mortagne
her
conduct
about
the
money
her
precipitate
flight
when
all
is
discovered
the
pains
she
is
at
to
conceal
herself
even
the
circumstances
of
her
arrest
all
go
to
prove
a
complicity
she
has
not
acted
like
a
mother
who
desires
to
save
her
daughter
and
withdraw
her
from
danger
but
like
a
trembling
accomplice
and
her
complicity
is
not
that
of
a
misguided
tenderness
it
is
the
fruit
of
party
spirit
the
inspiration
of
a
hatred
against
the
government
of
his
imperial
and
royal
majesty
misguided
maternal
tenderness
if
that
could
be
fairly
alleged
in
her
defence
would
not
however
excuse
it
and
we
must
not
forget
that
consentment
and
premeditated
is
the
surest
sign
of
guilt
thus
all
the
elements
of
the
crime
and
the
persons
committing
it
are
fully
brought
to
light
we
see
the
madness
of
faction
combining
with
pillage
and
greed
we
see
assassination
advised
by
party
spirit
under
whose
aegis
these
criminals
attempt
to
justify
themselves
for
the
basest
crimes
the
leaders
give
the
signal
for
the
pillage
of
the
public
money
which
money
is
to
be
used
for
their
ulterior
crimes
vile
stipendiaries
do
this
work
for
a
paltry
price
not
recoiling
from
murder
then
the
fomenters
of
rebellion
not
less
guilty
because
their
own
hands
have
neither
robbed
nor
murdered
divide
the
booty
and
dispose
of
it
what
community
can
tolerate
such
outrages
the
law
itself
is
scarcely
rigorous
enough
to
duly
punish
them
it
is
upon
the
above
facts
that
this
court
of
criminal
and
special

is
called
upon
to
decide
whether

this

than

are

more

the
scenes
where
this
drama
had
taken
place
the
forms
and
faces
of
the
accomplices
passed
before
his
eyes
he
pictured
to
himself
not
one
rifoel
but
a
chevalier
du
vissard
a
young
man
something
like
the
fergus
of
walter
scott
a
french
jacobite
he
developed
the
romance
of
an
ardent
young
girl
grossly
deceived
by
an
infamous
husband
a
style
of
romance
then
much
the
fashion
loving
the
young
and
gallant
leader
of
a
rebellion
against
the
empire
giving
herself
body
and
soul
like
another
diana
vernon
to
the
conspiracy
and
then
once
launched
on
that
fatal
incline
unable
to
stop
herself
had
she
rolled
to
the
scaffold
the
young
man
saw
in
his
own
mind
a
whole
world
and
he
peopled
it
he
wandered
in
the
shade
of
those
norman
groves
he
saw
the
breton
hero
and
madame
bryond
among
the
gorse
and
shrubbery
he
inhabited
the
old
chateau
of
he
shared
in
the
diverse
acts
of
all
those
many
personages
picturing
to
himself
the
notary
the
merchant
and
those
bold
chouans
his
mind
conceived
the
state
of
that
wild
country
where
lingered
still
the
memory
of
the
comtes
de
bauvan
de
longuy
the
exploits
of
the
massacre
at
la
vivetiere
the
death
of
the
marquis
de
montauran
of
whose
prowess
madame
de
la
chanterie
had
told
him
this
sort
of
vision
of
things
of
men
of
places
was
rapid
when
he
remembered
that
this
drama
must
relate
to
the
dignified
noble
deeply
religious
old
woman
whose
virtue
was
acting
upon
him
so
powerfully
as
to
be
upon
the
point
of
metamorphosing
him
godefroid
was
seized
with
a
sort
of
terror
and
turned
hastily
to
the
second
document
which
monsieur
alain
had
given
him
this
was
entitled
summary
on
behalf
of
madame
henriette
bryond
des
nee
lechantre
de
la
chanterie
no
longer
any
doubt
murmured
godefroid
we
are
condemned
and
guilty
but
if
ever
the
sovereign
had
reason
to
exercise
his
right
of
clemency
it
is
surely
in
a
case
like
this
here
is
a
young
woman
about
to
become
a
mother
and
condemned
to
death
from
a
prison
cell
with
the
scaffold
before
her
this
woman
will
tell
the
truth
the
trial
before
the
criminal
court
of
alencon
had
as
in
all
cases
where
there
are
many
accused
persons
in
a
conspiracy
inspired
by
certain
portions
which
were
seriously
obscure
the
chancellor
of
his
imperial
and
royal
majesty
knows
now
the
truth
about
the
mysterious
personage
named
le
marchand
whose
presence
in
the
department
of
the
orne
was
not
denied
by
the
government
during
the
trial
but
whom
the
prosecution
did
not
think
proper
to
call
as
witness
and
whom
the
defence
had
neither
the
power
nor
the
opportunity
to
find
that
personage
is
as
the
prosecuting
officer
the
police
of
paris
and
the
chancellor
of
his
imperial
and
royal
majesty
well
know
the
sieur
bryond
des
the
correspondent
since
of
the
comte
de
lille
known
elsewhere
as
the
baron
des
and
on
records
of
the
parisian
police
under
the
name
of
contenson
he
is
notorious
his
youth
and
name
were
degraded
by
vices
so
imperative
an
immorality
so
profound
conduct
so
criminal
that
his
infamous
life
must
have
ended
on
the
scaffold
if
he
had
not
possessed
the
ability
to
play
a
double
part
as
indicated
by
his
names
hereafter
as
his
passions
rule
him
more
and
more
he
will
end
by
falling
to
the
depths
of
infamy
in
spite
of
his
incontestable
ability
and
a
remarkable
mind
when
the
comte
de
lille
became
aware
of
this
man
s
character
he
no
longer
permitted
him
to
take
part
in
the
royalist
councils
or
to
handle
the
money
sent
to
france
he
thus
lost
the
resources
derived
from
these
masters
whose
service
had
been
profitable
to
him
it
was
then
that
he
returned
to
his
country
home
crippled
with
debt
his
traitorous
connection
with
the
intrigues
of
england
and
the
comte
de
lille
won
him
the
confidence
of
the
old
families
attached
to
the
cause
now
vanquished
by
the
genius
of
our
immortal
emperor
he
there
met
one
of
the
former
leaders
of
the
rebellion
with
whom
at
the
time
of
the
expedition
to
quberon
and
later
at
the
time
of
the
last
uprising
of
the
chouans
he
had
held
certain
relations
as
an
envoy
from
england
he
encouraged
the
schemes
of
this
young
agitator
rifoel
who
has
since
paid
with
his
life
on
the
scaffold
for
his
plots
against
the
state
through
him
bryond
was
able
to
penetrate
once
more
into
the
secrets
of
that
party
which
has
misunderstood
both
the
glory
of
the
emperor
napoleon
and
the
true
interests
of
the
nation
united
in
his
august
person
at
the
age
of
this
man
then
known
under
his
true
name
of
des
affecting
a
sincere
piety
professing
the
utmost
devotion
to
the
interests
of
the
comte
de
lille
and
a
reverence
for
the
memory
of
the
insurgents
who
lost
their
lives
at
the
west
disguising
with
great
ability
the
secrets
of
his
exhausted
youth
and
powerfully
protected
by
the
silence
of
creditors
and
by
the
spirit
of
caste
which
exists
among
all
country
this
man
truly
a
whited
sepulchre
was
introduced
as
possessing
every
claim
for
consideration
to
madame
lechantre
who
was
supposed
to
be
the
possessor
of
a
large
fortune
all
parties
conspired
to
promote
a
marriage
between
the
young
henriette
only
daughter
of
madame
lechantre
and
this
protege
of
the
priests
nobles
creditors
each
with
a
different
interest
loyal
in
some
selfish
in
others
blind
for
the
most
part
all
united
in
furthering
the
union
of
bernard
bryond
des
with
henriette
lechantre
the
good
sense
of
the
notary
who
had
charge
of
madame
lechantre
s
affairs
and
perhaps
his
distrust
were
the
actual
cause
of
the
disaster
of
this
young
girl
the
sieur
chesnel
notary
at
alencon
put
the
estate
of
the
sole
property
of
the
bride
under
the
dower
system
reserving
the
right
of
habitation
and
a
modest
income
to
the
mother
the
creditors
who
supposed
from
madame
lechantre
s
orderly
and
frugal
way
of
living
that
she
had
capital
laid
by
were
deceived
in
their
expectations
and
they
then
began
suits
which
revealed
the
precarious
financial
condition
of
bryond
serious
differences
now
arose
between
the
newly
married
pair
and
the
young
wife
had
occasion
to
know
the
depraved
habits
the
political
and
religious
atheism
and
shall
i
say
the
word
the
infamy
of
the
man
to
whom
her
life
had
been
so
fatally
united
bryond
forced
to
let
his
wife
into
the
secret
of
the
royalist
plots
gave
a
home
in
his
house
to
their
chief
agent
rifoel
du
vissard
the
character
of
rifoel
adventurous
brave
generous
exercised
a
charm
on
all
who
came
in
contact
with
him
as
was
abundantly
proved
during
his
trials
before
three
successive
criminal
courts
the
irresistible
influence
the
absolute
empire
he
acquired
over
the
mind
of
a
young
woman
who
saw
herself
suddenly
cast
into
the
abyss
of
a
fatal
marriage
is
but
too
visible
in
this
catastrophe
which
now
brings
her
a
suppliant
to
the
foot
of
the
throne
but
that
which
the
chancellor
of
his
imperial
and
royal
majesty
can
easily
verify
is
the
infamous
encouragement
given
by
bryond
to
this
intimacy
far
from
fulfilling
his
duty
as
guide
and
counsellor
to
a
child
whose
poor
deceived
mother
had
trusted
her
to
him
he
took
pleasure
in
drawing
closer
still
the
bonds
that
united
the
young
henriette
to
the
rebel
leader
the
plan
of
this
odious
being
who
takes
pride
in
despising
all
things
and
considers
nothing
but
the
satisfaction
of
his
passions
admitting
none
of
the
restraints
imposed
by
civil
or
religious
morality
was
as
follows
we
must
first
remark
however
that
such
plotting
was
familiar
to
a
man
who
ever
since
has
played
a
double
part
who
for
eight
years
deceived
the
comte
de
lille
and
his
adherents
and
probably
deceived
at
the
same
time
the
police
of
the
republic
and
the
empire
such
men
belong
only
to
those
who
pay
them
most
bryond
pushed
rifoel
to
crime
he
instigated
the
attacks
of
armed
men
upon
the
bearing
the
moneys
of
the
government
and
the
levying
of
a
heavy
tribute
from
the
purchasers
of
the
national
domain
a
tax
he
enforced
by
means
of
tortures
invented
by
him
which
carried
terror
through
five
departments
he
then
demanded
that
a
sum
of
three
hundred
thousand
francs
derived
from
these
plunderings
be
paid
to
him
for
the
liquidation
of
his
debts
when
he
met
with
resistance
on
the
part
of
his
wife
and
rifoel
and
saw
the
contempt
his
proposal
inspired
in
upright
minds
who
were
acting
only
from
party
spirit
he
determined
to
bring
them
both
under
the
rigor
of
the
law
in
the
next
occasion
of
their
committing
a
crime
he
disappeared
and
returned
to
paris
taking
with
him
all
information
as
to
the
then
condition
of
the
departments
of
the
west
the
brothers
chaussard
and
vauthier
were
as
the
chancellor
knows
bryond
s
correspondents
as
soon
as
the
attack
was
made
on
the
diligence
from
caen
bryond
returned
secretly
and
in
disguise
under
the
name
of
le
marchand
he
put
himself
into
secret
communication
with
the
prefect
and
the
magistrates
what
was
the
result
never
was
any
conspiracy
in
which
a
great
number
of
persons
took
part
so
rapidly
discovered
and
dealt
with
within
six
days
after
the
committal
of
the
crime
all
the
guilty
persons
were
followed
and
watched
with
an
intelligence
which
showed
the
most
accurate
knowledge
of
the
plans
and
of
the
individuals
concerned
in
them
the
immediate
arrest
trial
and
execution
of
rifoel
and
his
accomplices
are
the
proof
of
this
we
repeat
the
chancellor
knows
even
more
than
we
do
on
this
subject
if
ever
a
condemned
person
had
a
right
to
appeal
to
the
sovereign
s
mercy
it
is
henriette
lechantre
though
led
astray
by
love
by
ideas
of
rebellion
which
she
sucked
in
with
the
milk
that
fed
her
she
is
most
certainly
inexcusable
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
but
in
the
eyes
of
the
most
magnanimous
of
emperors
will
not
her
misfortunes
the
infamous
betrayal
of
her
husband
and
a
rash
enthusiasm
plead
for
her
the
greatest
of
all
captains
the
immortal
genius
which
pardoned
the
prince
of
hatzfeldt
and
is
able
to
divine
the
reasons
of
the
heart
will
he
not
admit
the
fatal
power
of
love
invincible
in
youth
which
extenuates
this
crime
great
as
it
was
heads
have
fallen
under
the
blade
of
the
law
only
one
of
the
guilty
persons
is
now
left
and
she
is
a
young
woman
a
minor
not
twenty
years
of
age
will
not
the
emperor
napoleon
the
great
grant
her
life
and
give
her
time
in
which
to
repent
is
not
that
to
share
the
part
of
god
for
henriette
lechantre
wife
of
bryond
des
her
defender
bordin
barrister
of
the
lower
court
of
the
department
of
the
seine
this
dreadful
drama
disturbed
the
little
sleep
that
godefroid
took
he
dreamed
of
that
penalty
of
death
such
as
the
physician
guillotin
has
made
it
with
a
philanthropic
object
through
the
hot
vapors
of
a
nightmare
he
saw
a
young
woman
beautiful
enthusiastic
enduring
the
last
preparations
drawn
in
that
fatal
tumbril
mounting
the
scaffold
and
crying
out
vive
le
roi
eager
to
know
the
whole
godefroid
rose
at
dawn
dressed
and
paced
his
room
then
stood
mechanically
at
his
window
gazing
at
the
sky
while
his
thoughts
reconstructed
this
drama
in
many
volumes
ever
on
that
darksome
background
of
chouans
peasants
country
gentlemen
rebel
leaders
spies
and
officers
of
justice
he
saw
the
vivid
figures
of
the
mother
and
the
daughter
detach
themselves
the
daughter
misleading
the
mother
the
daughter
victim
of
a
monster
victim
too
of
her
passion
for
one
of
those
bold
men
whom
later
we
have
glorified
as
heroes
and
to
whom
even
godefroid
s
imagination
lent
a
likeness
to
the
charettes
and
the
georges
cadoudals
those
giants
of
the
struggle
between
the
republic
and
the
monarchy
as
soon
as
godefroid
heard
the
goodman
alain
stirring
in
the
room
above
him
he
went
there
but
he
had
no
sooner
opened
the
door
than
he
closed
it
and
went
back
to
his
own
apartment
the
old
man
kneeling
by
his
chair
was
saying
his
morning
prayer
the
sight
of
that
whitened
head
bowed
in
an
attitude
of
humble
reverence
reminded
godefroid
of
his
own
forgotten
duties
and
he
prayed
fervently
i
expected
you
said
the
kind
old
man
when
godefroid
entered
his
room
some
fifteen
minutes
later
i
got
up
earlier
than
usual
for
i
felt
sure
you
would
be
madame
henriette
asked
godefroid
with
visible
anxiety
was
madame
s
daughter
replied
monsieur
alain
madame
s
name
is
lechantre
de
la
chanterie
under
the
empire
none
of
the
nobiliary
titles
were
allowed
nor
any
of
the
names
added
to
the
patronymic
or
original
names
therefore
the
baronne
des
was
called
madame
bryond
the
marquis
d
esgrignon
took
his
name
of
carol
citizen
carol
later
he
was
called
the
sieur
carol
the
troisvilles
became
the
sieurs
but
what
happened
did
the
emperor
pardon
her
alas
no
replied
alain
the
unfortunate
little
woman
not
years
old
perished
on
the
scaffold
after
reading
bordin
s
appeal
the
emperor
answered
very
much
in
these
terms
why
be
so
bitter
against
the
spy
a
spy
is
no
longer
a
man
he
ought
not
to
have
feelings
he
is
a
wheel
of
the
machinery
bryond
did
his
duty
if
instruments
of
that
kind
were
not
what
they
are
steel
bars
and
intelligent
only
in
the
service
of
the
power
employing
them
government
would
not
be
possible
the
sentences
of
criminal
courts
must
be
carried
out
or
the
judges
would
cease
to
have
confidence
in
themselves
or
in
me
besides
the
women
of
the
west
must
be
taught
not
to
meddle
in
plots
it
is
precisely
in
the
case
of
a
woman
that
justice
should
not
be
interfered
with
there
is
no
excuse
possible
for
an
attack
on
power
this
was
the
substance
of
what
the
emperor
said
as
bordin
repeated
it
to
me
learning
a
little
later
that
france
and
russia
were
about
to
measure
swords
against
each
other
and
that
the
emperor
was
to
go
two
thousand
miles
from
paris
to
attack
a
vast
and
desert
country
bordin
understood
the
secret
reason
of
the
emperor
s
harshness
to
insure
tranquillity
at
the
west
now
full
of
refractories
napoleon
believed
it
necessary
to
inspire
terror
bordin
could
do
no
but
madame
de
la
chanterie
said
godefroid
madame
de
la
chanterie
was
sentenced
to
twenty
years
imprisonment
replied
alain
as
she
was
already
transferred
to
bicetre
near
rouen
to
undergo
her
punishment
nothing
was
attempted
on
her
behalf
until
every
effort
had
been
made
to
save
henriette
who
had
grown
dearer
than
ever
to
her
mother
during
this
time
of
anxiety
indeed
if
it
had
not
been
for
bordin
s
assurance
that
he
could
obtain
henriette
s
pardon
it
is
doubtful
if
madame
could
have
survived
the
shock
of
the
sentence
when
the
appeal
failed
they
deceived
the
poor
mother
she
saw
her
daughter
once
after
the
execution
of
the
other
prisoners
not
knowing
that
madame
bryond
s
respite
was
due
to
a
false
declaration
of
pregnancy
made
to
gain
time
for
the
ah
i
understand
it
all
now
exclaimed
godefroid
no
my
dear
child
there
are
things
that
no
one
can
imagine
madame
thought
her
daughter
living
for
a
long
how
was
that
when
madame
des
learned
from
bordin
that
her
appeal
was
rejected
and
that
nothing
could
save
her
that
sublime
little
woman
had
the
courage
to
write
twenty
letters
dating
them
month
by
month
after
the
time
of
her
execution
so
as
to
make
her
poor
mother
in
her
prison
believe
she
was
alive
in
those
letters
she
told
of
a
gradual
illness
which
would
end
in
death
they
covered
a
period
of
two
years
madame
de
la
chanterie
was
therefore
prepared
for
the
news
of
her
daughter
s
death
but
she
thought
it
a
natural
one
she
did
not
know
until
that
henriette
had
died
on
the
scaffold
for
two
years
madame
was
herded
among
the
most
depraved
of
her
sex
but
thanks
to
the
urgency
of
the
champignelles
and
the
beauseants
she
was
after
the
second
year
placed
in
a
cell
by
herself
where
she
lived
like
a
cloistered
and
the
others
asked

the
notary
leveille

grenier
horeau
cabot
minard
and

were
condemned
to

and
executed
the
same
day

condemned
to
hard
labor
for
twenty
years
was
branded
and
sent
to
the
galleys
the
chaussards
and

received
the
same
sentence
but
were
pardoned
by
the

and

were
condemned
to
five
years
imprisonment
the
woman
bourget
to
twenty
years
imprisonment
chargegrain
and
rousseau
were
acquitted
those
who
escaped
were
all
condemned
to
death
except
the
girl
godard
who
was
no
other
as
you
have
probably
guessed
than
our
poor
manon
manon
exclaimed
godefroid
oh
you
don
t
know
manon
yet
replied
the
kind
old
alain
that
devoted
creature
condemned
to
twelve
years
imprisonment
gave
herself
up
that
she
might
take
care
of
madame
de
la
chanterie
and
wait
upon
her
our
dear
vicar
was
the
priest
at
mortagne
who
gave
the
last
sacraments
to
the
baronne
des
he
had
the
courage
to
go
with
her
to
the
scaffold
and
to
him
she
gave
her
farewell
kiss
that
courageous
noble
priest
had
also
accompanied
the
chevalier
du
vissard
our
dear
abbe
de
veze
has
therefore
known
all
the
secrets
of
those
i
see
why
his
hair
is
so
white
said
godefroid
alas
yes
said
alain
he
received
from
amedee
du
vissard
a
miniature
of
madame
des
the
only
portrait
of
her
that
exists
therefore
the
abbe
became
almost
sacred
in
madame
de
la
chanterie
s
eyes
when
she
social
when
did
that
happen
asked
godefroid
why
at
the
restoration
of
louis

of
the
chevalier

created

with

madame

to
the
king
you
have
suffered
greatly
for
me
madame
la
baronne
you
have
every
right
to
my
favor
and
gratitude
he
said
to
her
sire
she
replied
your
majesty
has
so
many
sorrows
to
console
that
i
do
not
wish
that
mine
which
is
inconsolable
should
be
a
burden
upon
you
to
live
forgotten
to
mourn
my
daughter
and
do
some
good
that
is
my
life
if
anything
could
soften
my
grief
it
is
the
kindness
of
my
king
it
is
the
pleasure
of
seeing
that
providence
has
not
allowed
our
long
devotion
to
be
and
what
did
louis
xviii
do
asked
godefroid
he
restored
two
hundred
thousand
francs
in
money
to
madame
de
la
chanterie
for
the
estate
of
had
been
sold
to
pay
the
costs
of
the
trial
in
the
decree
of
pardon
issued
for
madame
la
baronne
and
her
servant
the
king
expressed
regret
for
the
suffering
borne
in
his
cause
adding
that
the
zeal
of
his
servants
had
gone
too
far
in
its
methods
of
but
and
this
is
a
horrible
thing
it
will
serve
to
show
you
a
curious
trait
in
the
character
of
that
monarch
he
employed
bryond
in
his
detective
police
throughout
his
oh
kings
kings
cried
godefroid
and
is
the
wretch
still
living
no
the
wretch
as
you
justly
call
him
who
concealed
his
real
name
under
that
of
contenson
died
about
the
close
of
the
year
or
the
beginning
of
in
trying
to
arrest
a
criminal
who
escaped
over
a
roof
he
fell
into
the
street
louis
xviii
shared
napoleon
s
ideas
as
to
spies
and
police
madame
de
la
chanterie
is
a
saint
she
prays
constantly
for
the
soul
of
that
man
and
has
two
masses
said
yearly
for
him
as
i
have
already
told
you
madame
de
la
chanterie
knew
nothing
of
the
dangers
her
daughter
was
incurring
until
the
day
when
the
money
was
carried
to
alencon
nevertheless
she
was
unable
to
establish
her
innocence
although
defended
by
one
of
the
greatest
lawyers
of
that
time
the
president
du
ronceret
and
the
blondet
of
the
court
of
alencon
did
their
best
to
save
our
poor
lady
but
the
influence
of
the
councillor
of
the
imperial
court
who
presided
at
her
trial
before
the
criminal
and
special
court
the
famous
mergi
and
that
of
bourlac
the
was
such
over
the
other
judges
that
they
obtained
her
condemnation
both
bourlac
and
mergi
showed
extraordinary
bitterness
against
mother
and
daughter
they
called
the
baronne
des
the
woman
bryond
and
madame
the
woman
the
names
of
accused
persons
in
those
days
were
all
brought
to
one
republican
level
and
were
sometimes
unrecognizable
the
trial
had
several
very
extraordinary
features
which
i
can
not
now
recall
one
piece
of
audacity
remains
in
my
memory
which
will
serve
to
show
you
what
sort
of
men
those
chouans
were
the
crowd
which
assembled
to
hear
the
trial
was
immense
it
even
filled
the
corridors
and
the
square
before
the
one
morning
after
the
opening
of
the
and
before
the
arrival
of
the
judges
a
famous
chouan
sprang
over
the
balustrade
into
the
middle
of
the
crowd
elbowing
right
and
left
charging
like
a
wild
boar
as
bordin
told
me
through
the
frightened
people
the
guards
and
the
gendarmes
dashed
after
him
and
caught
him
just
as
he
reached
the
square
after
that
the
guards
were
doubled
a
picket
of
gendarmerie
was
stationed
in
the
square
for
they
feared
there
were
chouans
on
the
ground
ready
to
rescue
the
prisoners
as
it
was
three
persons
were
crushed
to
death
on
this
occasion
it
was
afterwards
discovered
that
contenson
neither
my
friend
bordin
nor
i
could
ever
bring
ourselves
to
call
him
the
baron
des
nor
bryond
which
is
the
name
of
an
old
family
it
was
i
say
discovered
that
this
wretch
contenson
had
obtained
sixty
thousand
francs
of
the
stolen
money
from
the
chaussards
he
gave
ten
thousand
to
the
younger
chaussard
whom
he
took
with
him
into
the
detective
police
and
innoculated
with
his
vices
his
other
accomplices
got
nothing
from
him
madame
de
la
chanterie
invested
the
money
restored
to
her
by
the
king
in
the
public
funds
and
bought
this
house
to
please
her
uncle
monsieur
de
boisfrelon
who
gave
her
the
money
for
the
purpose
and
died
in
the
rooms
you
now
occupy
this
tranquil
neighborhood
is
near
the
archbishop
s
palace
where
our
dear
abbe
has
duties
with
the
cardinal
that
was
one
of
the
chief
reasons
why
madame
agreed
to
her
uncle
s
wish
here
in
this
cloistral
life
the
fearful
misfortunes
which
overwhelmed
her
for
years
have
been
brought
to
a
close
now
you
can
understand
the
majesty
the
grandeur
of
this
victim
august
i
venture
to
call
yes
said
godefroid
the
imprint
of
all
the
blows
she
has
received
remains
and
gives
her
something
i
can
scarcely
describe
it
that
is
grand
and
every
wound
every
fresh
blow
has
increased
her
patience
her
resignation
continued
alain
but
if
you
knew
her
as
we
know
her
you
would
see
how
keen
is
her
sensibility
how
active
the
inexhaustible
tenderness
of
her
heart
and
you
would
almost
stand
in
awe
of
the
tears
she
had
shed
and
the
fervent
prayers
she
had
made
to
god
ah
it
was
necessary
to
have
known
as
she
did
a
brief
period
of
happiness
to
bear
up
as
she
has
done
under
such
misfortunes
here
is
a
tender
heart
a
gentle
soul
in
a
steel
body
hardened
by
privations
by
toil
by
her
life
explains
why
hermits
live
so
long
said
godefroid
there
are
days
when
i
ask
myself
what
is
the
meaning
of
a
life
like
hers
can
it
be
that
god
reserves
such
trials
such
cruel
tests
for
those
of
his
creatures
who
are
to
sit
on
the
morrow
of
their
death
at
his
right
hand
said
the
good
alain
quite
unconscious
that
he
was
artlessly
expressing
the
whole
doctrine
of
swedenborg
on
the
angels
and
you
tell
me
said
godefroid
that
in
prison
madame
de
la
chanterie
was
put
with
madame
was
sublime
in
her
prison
said
alain
for
three
whole
years
she
realized
the
story
of
the
vicar
of
wakefield
and
was
able
to
convert
many
of
the
worst
women
about
her
during
her
imprisonment
she
observed
the
habits
and
customs
of
these
women
and
was
seized
with
that
great
pity
for
the
sorrows
of
the
people
which
has
since
filled
her
soul
and
made
her
the
angel
of
parisian
charity
in
that
dreadful
bicetre
of
rouen
she
conceived
the
plan
to
the
realization
of
which
we
are
now
devoted
it
was
she
has
often
told
us
a
delightful
dream
an
angelic
inspiration
in
the
midst
of
hell
though
she
never
thought
she
should
realize
it
when
in
peace
and
quietude
seemed
really
to
return
to
paris
her
dream
came
back
to
her
madame
la
duchesse
d
angouleme
afterwards
the
dauphine
the
duchesse
de
berry
the
archbishop
later
the
chancellor
and
several
pious
persons
contributed
liberally
the
first
necessary
sums
these
funds
have
been
increased
by
the
addition
of
our
own
available
property
from
which
we
take
only
enough
for
our
actual
tears
came
into
godefroid
s
eyes
we
are
the
ministers
of
a
christian
idea
we
belong
body
and
soul
to
its
work
the
spirit
of
which
the
founder
of
which
is
the
baronne
de
la
chanterie
whom
you
hear
us
so
respectfully
call
ah
let
me
belong
to
you
cried
godefroid
stretching
out
his
hands
to
the
kind
old
man
now
you
understand
why
there
are
some
subjects
of
conversation
which
are
never
mentioned
here
nor
even
alluded
to
you
can
now
see
the
obligations
of
delicacy
that
all
who
live
in
this
house
contract
towards
one
who
seems
to
us
a
saint
you
comprehend
do
you
not
the
influence
of
a
woman
made
sacred
by
such
sorrows
who
knows
so
many
things
to
whom
anguish
has
said
its
utmost
word
who
from
each
adversity
has
drawn
instruction
in
whom
all
virtues
have
the
double
strength
of
cruel
trial
and
of
constant
practice
whose
soul
is
spotless
and
without
reproach
whose
motherhood
knew
only
grief
whose
married
love
knew
only
bitterness
on
whom
life
smiled
for
a
brief
time
only
but
for
whom
heaven
reserves
a
palm
the
reward
of
resignation
and
of
under
sorrow
ah
does
she
not
even
triumph
over
job
in
never
murmuring
can
you
wonder
that
her
words
are
so
powerful
her
old
age
so
young
her
soul
so
communicative
her
glance
so
convincing
she
has
obtained
extraordinary
powers
in
dealing
with
sufferers
for
she
has
suffered
all
she
is
the
living
image
of
charity
cried
godefroid
fervently
can
i
ever
be
one
of
you
you
must
first
endure
the
tests
and
above
all
believe
said
the
old
man
gently
so
long
as
you
have
no
faith
so
long
as
you
have
not
absorbed
into
your
heart
and
mind
the
divine
meaning
of
saint
paul
s
epistle
upon
charity
you
can
not
share
our
second
episode
the
initiate
xi
the
police
of
the
good
god
like
evil
good
is
contagious
therefore
when
madame
de
la
chanterie
s
lodger
had
lived
in
that
old
and
silent
house
for
some
months
after
the
worthy
alain
s
last
confidence
which
gave
him
the
deepest
respect
for
the
religious
lives
of
those
among
whom
his
was
cast
he
experienced
that
of
the
soul
which
comes
of
a
regulated
existence
gentle
customs
and
harmony
of
nature
in
those
who
surround
us
at
the
end
of
four
months
during
which
time
godefroid
heard
neither
a
loud
voice
nor
an
argument
he
could
not
remember
that
he
had
ever
been
if
not
as
happy
at
least
as
tranquil
and
contented
he
now
judged
soundly
of
the
world
seeing
it
from
afar
at
last
the
desire
he
had
felt
for
months
to
be
a
sharer
in
the
work
of
these
mysterious
persons
became
a
passion
without
being
great
philosophers
we
can
all
understand
the
force
which
passions
acquire
in
solitude
thus
it
happened
that
one
day
a
day
made
solemn
by
the
power
of
the
spirit
within
him
godefroid
again
went
up
to
see
the
good
old
alain
him
whom
madame
de
la
chanterie
called
her
lamb
the
member
of
the
community
who
seemed
to
godefroid
the
least
imposing
the
most
approachable
member
of
the
fraternity
intending
to
obtain
from
him
some
definite
light
on
the
conditions
of
the
sacred
work
to
which
these
brothers
of
god
were
dedicated
the
allusions
made
to
a
period
of
trial
seemed
to
imply
an
initiation
which
he
was
now
desirous
of
receiving
his
curiosity
had
not
been
satisfied
by
what
the
venerable
old
man
had
already
told
him
as
to
the
causes
which
led
to
the
work
of
madame
de
la
chanterie
he
wanted
to
know
more
for
the
third
time
godefroid
entered
monsieur
alain
s
room
just
as
the
old
man
was
beginning
his
evening
reading
of
the
imitation
of
jesus
this
time
the
kindly
soul
did
not
restrain
a
smile
when
he
saw
the
young
man
and
he
said
at
once
without
allowing
godefroid
to
speak
why
do
you
come
to
me
my
dear
boy
why
not
go
to
madame
i
am
the
most
ignorant
the
most
imperfect
the
least
spiritual
of
our
number
for
the
last
three
days
he
added
with
a
shrewd
little
glance
madame
and
my
other
friends
have
read
your
what
have
they
read
there
asked
godefroid
ah
replied
the
goodman
without
evasion
they
see
in
you
a
rather
artless
desire
to
belong
to
our
little
flock
but
this
sentiment
is
not
yet
an
ardent
vocation
yes
he
continued
replying
to
a
gesture
of
godefroid
s
you
have
more
curiosity
than
fervor
you
are
not
yet
so
detached
from
your
old
ideas
that
you
do
not
look
forward
to
something
adventurous
romantic
as
they
say
in
the
incidents
of
our
godefroid
could
not
keep
himself
from
blushing
you
see
a
likeness
between
our
occupations
and
those
of
the
caliphs
of
the
arabian
nights
and
you
are
thinking
about
the
satisfaction
you
will
have
in
playing
the
part
of
the
good
genii
in
the
tales
of
benevolence
you
are
inventing
ah
my
dear
boy
that
laugh
of
yours
proves
to
me
that
we
were
quite
right
in
that
conjecture
how
do
you
expect
to
conceal
any
feeling
from
persons
whose
business
it
is
to
divine
the
most
hidden
motion
of
souls
the
tricks
of
poverty
the
calculations
of
indigence
honest
spies
the
police
of
the
good
god
old
judges
whose
code
contains
nothing
but
absolutions
doctors
of
suffering
whose
only
remedy
is
oftentimes
the
wise
application
of
money
but
you
see
my
child
we
don
t
wish
to
quarrel
with
the
motives
which
bring
us
a
neophyte
provided
he
will
really
stay
and
become
a
brother
of
the
order
we
shall
judge
you
by
your
work
there
are
two
kinds
of
curiosity
that
of
good
and
that
of
evil
just
at
this
moment
you
have
that
of
good
if
you
should
work
in
our
vineyard
the
juice
of
our
grapes
will
make
you
perpetually
thirsty
for
the
divine
fruit
the
initiation
is
as
in
that
of
all
natural
knowledge
easy
in
appearance
difficult
in
reality
benevolence
is
like
poesy
nothing
is
easier
than
to
catch
the
appearance
of
it
but
here
as
in
parnassus
nothing
contents
us
but
perfection
to
become
one
to
us
you
must
acquire
a
great
knowledge
of
life
and
what
a
life
good
god
parisian
life
which
defies
the
sagacity
of
the
minister
of
police
and
all
his
agents
we
have
to
circumvent
the
perpetual
conspiracy
of
evil
master
it
in
all
its
forms
while
it
changes
so
often
as
to
seem
infinite
charity
in
paris
must
know
as
much
as
vice
just
as
a
policeman
must
know
all
the
tricks
of
thieves
we
must
each
be
frank
and
each
distrustful
we
must
have
quick
perception
and
a
sure
and
rapid
judgment
and
then
my
child
we
are
old
and
getting
older
but
we
are
so
content
with
the
results
we
have
now
obtained
that
we
do
not
want
to
die
without
leaving
successors
in
the
work
if
you
persist
in
your
desire
you
will
be
our
first
pupil
and
all
the
dearer
to
us
on
that
account
there
is
no
risk
for
us
because
god
brought
you
to
us
yours
is
a
good
nature
soured
since
you
have
been
here
the
evil
leaven
has
weakened
the
divine
nature
of
madame
has
acted
upon
yours
yesterday
we
took
counsel
together
and
inasmuch
as
i
have
your
confidence
my
good
brothers
resolved
to
give
me
to
you
as
guardian
and
teacher
does
that
please
you
ah
my
kind
monsieur
alain
your
eloquence
awakens
no
my
child
it
is
not
i
who
speak
well
it
is
things
that
are
eloquent
we
can
be
sure
of
being
great
even
sublime
in
obeying
god
in
imitating
jesus
christ
imitating
him
i
mean
as
much
as
men
are
able
to
do
so
aided
by
this
moment
then
decides
my
life
cried
godefroid
i
feel
within
me
the
fervor
of
a
neophyte
i
wish
to
spend
my
life
in
doing
that
is
the
secret
of
remaining
in
god
replied
alain
have
you
studied
our
motto
means
to
go
beyond
this
world
leaving
benefits
on
our
yes
i
have
understood
it
i
have
put
the
motto
of
the
order
before
my
that
is
well
it
is
a
trifling
action
but
it
counts
for
much
in
my
eyes
and
now
i
have
your
first
affair
your
first
duel
with
misery
prepared
for
you
i
ll
put
your
foot
in
the
stirrup
we
are
about
to
part
yes
i
myself
am
detached
from
the
convent
to
live
for
a
time
in
the
crater
of
a
volcano
i
am
to
be
a
clerk
in
a
great
manufactory
where
the
workmen
are
infected
with
communistic
doctrines
and
dream
of
social
destruction
the
abolishment
of
masters
not
knowing
that
that
would
be
the
death
of
industry
of
commerce
of
manufactures
i
shall
stay
there
goodness
knows
how
long
perhaps
a
year
keeping
the
books
and
paying
the
wages
this
will
give
me
an
entrance
into
a
hundred
or
a
hundred
and
twenty
homes
of
misled
no
doubt
by
poverty
even
before
the
pamphlets
of
the
day
misled
them
but
you
and
i
can
see
each
other
on
sundays
and
we
shall
be
in
the
same
quarter
and
if
you
come
to
the
church
of
du
you
will
find
me
there
any
day
at
seven
when
i
hear
mass
if
you
meet
me
elsewhere
don
t
recognize
me
unless
you
see
me
rub
my
hands
like
a
man
who
is
pleased
at
something
that
is
one
of
our
signs
we
have
a
language
of
signs
like
the
deaf
and
dumb
you
ll
soon
find
out
the
absolute
necessity
of
godefroid
made
a
gesture
which
the
goodman
alain
interpreted
for
he
laughed
and
immediately
went
on
to
say
now
for
your
affair
we
do
not
practise
either
the
benevolence
or
the
philanthropy
that
you
know
about
which
are
really
divided
into
several
branches
all
taken
advantage
of
by
sharpers
in
charity
as
a
business
we
practise
charity
as
our
great
and
sublime
saint
paul
defines
it
for
my
dear
lad
we
think
that
charity
and
charity
alone
which
is
love
can
heal
the
wounds
of
paris
in
our
eyes
misery
of
whatever
kind
poverty
suffering
misfortune
grief
evil
no
matter
how
produced
or
in
what
social
class
they
show
themselves
have
equal
rights
whatever
his
opinions
or
beliefs
an
unhappy
man
is
before
all
else
an
unhappy
man
and
we
ought
not
to
attempt
to
turn
his
face
to
our
holy
mother
church
until
we
have
saved
him
from
despair
or
hunger
moreover
we
ought
to
convert
him
to
goodness
more
by
example
and
by
gentleness
than
by
any
other
means
and
we
believe
that
god
will
specially
help
us
in
this
all
constraint
is
bad
of
the
manifold
parisian
miseries
the
most
difficult
to
discover
and
the
bitterest
is
that
of
worthy
persons
of
the
middle
classes
who
have
fallen
into
poverty
for
they
make
concealment
a
point
of
honor
those
sorrows
my
dear
godefroid
are
to
us
the
object
of
special
solicitude
such
persons
usually
have
intelligence
and
good
hearts
they
return
to
us
sometimes
with
usury
the
sums
that
we
lend
them
such
restitutions
recoup
us
in
the
long
run
for
the
losses
we
occasionally
incur
through
impostors
shiftless
creatures
or
those
whom
misfortunes
have
rendered
stupid
through
such
persons
we
often
obtain
invaluable
help
in
our
investigations
our
work
has
now
become
so
vast
its
details
are
so
multifarious
that
we
no
longer
suffice
of
ourselves
to
carry
it
on
so
for
the
last
year
we
have
a
physician
of
our
own
in
every
arrondissement
in
paris
each
of
us
takes
general
charge
of
four
arrondissements
we
pay
each
physician
three
thousand
francs
a
year
to
take
care
of
our
poor
his
time
belongs
to
us
in
the
first
instance
but
we
do
not
prevent
him
from
attending
other
sick
persons
if
he
can
would
you
believe
that
for
many
months
we
were
unable
to
find
twelve
really
trustworthy
valuable
men
in
spite
of
all
our
own
efforts
and
those
of
our
friends
we
could
not
employ
any
but
men
of
absolute
discreetness
pure
lives
sound
knowledge
experience
active
men
and
lovers
of
doing
good
now
although
there
are
in
paris
some
ten
thousand
individuals
more
or
less
who
would
gladly
do
the
work
we
could
not
find
twelve
to
meet
our
needs
in
a
whole
our
saviour
had
difficulty
in
gathering
his
apostles
and
even
then
a
traitor
and
an
unbeliever
got
among
them
said
godefroid
however
within
the
last
month
all
our
arrondissements
are
provided
with
a
visitor
that
is
the
name
we
give
to
our
physicians
at
the
same
time
the
business
is
increasing
and
we
have
all
redoubled
our
activity
if
i
confide
to
you
these
secrets
of
our
system
it
is
that
you
must
know
the
physician
that
is
the
visitor
of
the
arrondissement
to
which
we
are
about
to
send
you
from
him
all
original
information
about
our
cases
comes
this
visitor
is
named
berton
doctor
berton
he
lives
in
the
rue
d
enfer
and
now
here
are
the
facts
doctor
berton
is
attending
a
lady
whose
disease
puzzles
and
defies
science
that
of
course
is
not
our
concern
but
that
of
the
faculty
our
business
is
to
discover
the
condition
of
the
family
of
this
patient
doctor
berton
suspects
that
their
poverty
is
frightful
and
concealed
with
a
pride
and
determination
which
demand
our
utmost
care
until
now
my
son
i
should
have
found
time
for
this
case
but
the
work
i
am
undertaking
obliges
me
to
find
a
helper
in
my
four
arrondissements
and
you
shall
be
that
helper
this
family
lives
in
the
rue
des
champs
in
a
house
at
the
corner
of
the
boulevard
du
you
will
find
a
room
to
let
in
the
same
house
where
you
can
live
for
a
time
so
as
to
discover
the
truth
about
these
persons
be
sordid
for
yourself
but
as
for
the
money
you
may
think
needed
for
this
case
have
no
uneasiness
i
will
remit
you
such
sums
as
we
may
judge
necessary
after
ourselves
considering
all
the
circumstances
but
remember
that
you
must
study
the
moral
qualities
of
these
unfortunates
their
hearts
the
honorableness
of
their
feelings
those
are
our
guarantees
miserly
we
may
be
for
ourselves
and
generous
to
those
who
suffer
but
we
must
be
prudent
and
even
calculating
for
we
are
dealing
with
the
money
of
the
poor
so
then
morning
you
can
start
think
over
the
power
we
put
in
your
hands
the
brothers
are
with
you
in
ah
cried
godefroid
you
have
given
me
such
a
pleasure
in
the
opportunity
of
doing
good
and
making
myself
worthy
to
belong
to
you
some
day
that
i
shall
not
sleep
one
more
word
my
child
i
told
you
not
to
recognize
me
without
the
signal
the
same
rule
applies
to
the
other
gentlemen
and
to
madame
and
even
to
the
people
you
see
about
this
house
we
are
forced
to
keep
up
an
absolute
incognito
in
all
we
do
this
is
so
necessary
to
our
enterprises
that
we
have
made
a
rule
about
it
we
seek
to
be
ignored
lost
in
this
great
paris
remember
also
my
dear
godefroid
the
spirit
of
our
order
which
is
never
to
appear
as
benefactors
to
play
an
obscure
part
that
of
intermediaries
we
always
present
ourselves
as
the
agent
of
a
pious
saintly
person
in
fact
we
are
working
for
god
so
that
none
of
those
we
deal
with
may
feel
the
obligation
of
gratitude
towards
any
of
us
or
think
we
are
wealthy
persons
true
sincere
humility
not
the
false
humility
of
those
who
seek
thereby
to
be
set
in
the
light
must
inspire
you
and
rule
all
your
thoughts
you
may
indeed
be
glad
when
you
succeed
but
so
long
as
you
feel
within
you
a
sentiment
of
vanity
or
of
pride
you
are
not
worthy
to
do
the
work
of
the
order
we
have
known
two
perfect
men
one
who
was
one
of
our
founders
judge
popinot
the
other
is
revealed
by
his
works
he
is
a
country
doctor
whose
name
is
written
on
the
annals
of
his
canton
that
man
my
dear
godefroid
is
one
of
the
greatest
men
of
our
time
he
brought
a
whole
region
out
of
wretchedness
into
prosperity
out
of
irreligion
into
christianity
out
of
barbarism
into
civilization
the
names
of
those
two
men
are
graven
on
our
hearts
and
we
have
taken
them
as
our
models
we
should
be
happy
indeed
if
we
ourselves
could
some
day
acquire
in
paris
the
influence
that
country
doctor
had
in
his
canton
but
here
the
sore
is
vast
beyond
our
strength
at
present
may
god
preserve
to
us
madame
may
he
send
us
some
young
helpers
like
you
and
perhaps
we
may
yet
leave
behind
us
an
institution
worthy
of
his
divine
religion
and
now
your
initiation
begins
ah
i
chatter
like
a
professor
and
forget
the
essential
thing
here
is
the
address
of
that
family
he
added
giving
godefroid
a
piece
of
paper
i
have
added
the
number
of
berton
s
house
in
the
rue
d
enfer
and
now
go
and
pray
to
god
to
help
the
country
doctor
little
brown
boston
godefroid
took
the
old
man
s
hands
and
pressed
them
tenderly
wishing
him
and
assuring
him
he
would
not
neglect
a
single
point
of
his
advice
all
that
you
have
said
to
me
he
added
is
graven
in
my
memory
the
old
man
smiled
expressing
no
doubts
then
he
rose
to
kneel
in
his
accustomed
place
godefroid
retired
joyful
in
at
last
sharing
the
mysteries
of
that
house
and
in
having
an
occupation
which
feeling
as
he
did
then
was
to
him
an
untold
pleasure
the
next
day
at
breakfast
monsieur
alain
s
place
was
vacant
but
no
one
remarked
upon
it
godefroid
made
no
allusion
to
the
cause
of
his
absence
neither
did
any
one
question
him
as
to
the
mission
the
old
man
had
entrusted
to
him
he
thus
took
his
first
lesson
in
discreetness
nevertheless
after
breakfast
he
did
take
madame
de
la
chanterie
apart
and
told
her
that
he
should
be
absent
for
some
days
that
is
good
my
child
replied
madame
de
la
chanterie
try
to
do
honor
to
your
godfather
who
has
answered
for
you
to
his
godefroid
bade
adieu
to
the
three
remaining
brethren
who
made
him
an
affectionate
bow
by
which
they
seemed
to
bless
his
entrance
upon
a
painful
career
association
one
of
the
greatest
social
forces
and
that
which
made
the
europe
of
the
rests
on
principles
which
since
no
longer
exist
in
france
where
the
individual
has
now
triumphed
over
the
state
association
requires
in
the
first
place
a
that
is
not
understood
in
our
day
also
a
guileless
faith
which
is
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
the
nation
and
lastly
a
discipline
against
which
men
in
these
days
revolt
and
which
the
catholic
religion
alone
can
enforce
the
moment
an
association
is
formed
among
us
each
member
returning
to
his
own
home
from
an
assembly
where
noble
sentiments
have
been
proclaimed
thinks
of
making
his
own
bed
out
of
that
collective
devotion
that
union
of
forces
and
of
milking
to
his
own
profit
the
common
cow
which
not
being
able
to
supply
so
many
individual
demands
dies
exhausted
who
knows
how
many
generous
sentiments
were
blasted
how
many
fruitful
germs
may
have
perished
lost
to
the
nation
through
the
infamous
deceptions
of
the
french
carbonari
the
patriotic
subscriptions
to
the
champ
d
asile
and
other
political
deceptions
which
ought
to
have
been
grand
and
noble
dramas
and
proved
to
be
the
farces
and
the
melodramas
of
police
courts
it
is
the
same
with
industrial
association
as
it
is
with
political
association
love
of
self
is
substituted
for
the
love
of
collective
bodies
the
corporations
and
the
hanse
leagues
of
the
which
we
shall
some
day
are
still
impossible
consequently
the
only
societies
which
actually
exist
are
those
of
religious
bodies
against
whom
a
heavy
war
is
being
made
at
this
moment
for
the
natural
tendency
of
sick
persons
is
to
quarrel
with
remedies
and
often
with
physicians
france
ignores
therefore
no
association
can
live
except
through
religious
sentiment
the
only
sentiment
that
quells
the
rebellions
of
mind
the
calculations
of
ambition
and
greeds
of
all
kinds
the
seekers
of
better
worlds
ignore
the
fact
that
association
has
such
worlds
to
offer
as
he
walked
through
the
streets
godefroid
felt
himself
another
man
whoever
could
have
looked
into
his
being
would
have
admired
the
curious
phenomenon
of
the
communication
of
collective
power
he
was
no
longer
a
mere
man
he
was
a
tenfold
force
knowing
himself
the
representative
of
persons
whose
united
forces
upheld
his
actions
and
walked
beside
him
bearing
that
power
in
his
heart
he
felt
within
him
a
plenitude
of
life
a
noble
might
which
uplifted
him
it
was
as
he
afterwards
said
one
of
the
finest
moments
of
his
whole
existence
he
was
conscious
of
a
new
sense
an
omnipotence
more
sure
than
that
of
despots
moral
power
is
like
thought
limitless
to
live
for
others
he
thought
to
act
with
others
all
as
one
and
act
alone
as
all
together
to
have
for
leader
charity
the
noblest
the
most
living
of
those
ideal
figures
christianity
has
made
for
us
this
is
indeed
to
live
come
come
repress
that
petty
joy
which
father
alain
laughed
at
and
yet
how
singular
it
is
that
in
seeking
to
set
myself
aside
from
life
i
have
found
the
power
i
have
sought
so
long
yes
the
world
of
misery
will
belong
to
me
xii
a
case
to
investigate
godefroid
walked
from
the
cloister
of
to
the
avenue
de
l
observatoire
in
such
a
state
of
exaltation
that
he
never
noticed
the
length
of
the
way
when
he
reached
the
rue
des
champs
at
the
point
where
it
joins
the
rue
de
l
ouest
he
was
amazed
to
find
neither
of
these
streets
being
paved
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
great
in
that
fine
open
quarter
persons
walked
on
planks
laid
down
beside
the
houses
and
along
the
marshy
gardens
or
on
narrow
paths
flanked
on
each
side
by
stagnant
water
which
sometimes
turned
them
into
rivulets
by
dint
of
searching
he
found
the
house
he
wanted
but
he
did
not
reach
it
without
difficulty
it
was
evidently
an
abandoned
factory
the
building
was
narrow
and
the
side
of
it
was
a
long
wall
with
many
windows
and
no
architectural
decoration
whatever
none
of
these
windows
which
were
square
were
on
the
lower
floor
where
there
was
no
opening
but
a
very
miserable
godefroid
supposed
that
the
proprietor
had
turned
the
building
into
a
number
of
small
tenements
to
make
it
profitable
for
a
written
placard
above
the
door
stated
that
there
were
several
rooms
to
godefroid
rang
but
no
one
came
while
he
was
waiting
a
person
who
went
by
pointed
out
to
him
that
the
house
had
another
entrance
on
the
boulevard
where
he
might
get
admittance
godefroid
followed
this
advice
and
saw
at
the
farther
end
of
a
little
garden
which
extended
along
the
boulevard
a
second
door
to
the
house
the
garden
rather
sloped
downward
for
there
was
enough
difference
in
level
between
the
boulevard
and
the
rue
des
champs
to
make
it
a
sort
of
ditch
godefroid
therefore
walked
along
one
of
the
paths
at
the
end
of
which
he
saw
an
old
woman
whose
dilapidated
garments
were
in
keeping
with
the
house
was
it
you
who
rang
at
the
other
door
she
asked
yes
madame
do
you
show
the
lodgings
on
the
woman
s
replying
that
she
did
godefroid
inquired
if
the
other
lodgers
were
quiet
persons
his
occupations
he
said
were
such
that
he
needed
silence
and
peace
he
was
a
bachelor
and
would
be
glad
to
arrange
with
the
portress
to
do
his
housekeeping
on
this
suggestion
the
portress
assumed
a
gracious
manner
monsieur
has
fallen
on
his
feet
in
coming
here
then
she
said
except
on
the
chaumiere
days
the
boulevard
is
as
lonely
as
the
pontine
ah
you
know
the
pontine
marshes
said
godefroid
no
monsieur
i
don
t
but
i
ve
got
an
old
gentleman
upstairs
whose
daughter
seems
to
get
her
living
by
being
ill
and
he
says
that
i
only
repeat
it
the
poor
old
man
will
be
glad
to
know
that
monsieur
likes
quiet
for
a
noisy
neighbor
he
thinks
would
kill
his
daughter
on
the
second
floor
we
have
two
writers
they
don
t
come
in
till
midnight
and
are
off
before
eight
in
the
morning
they
say
they
are
authors
but
i
don
t
know
where
or
when
they
while
speaking
the
portress
was
showing
godefroid
up
one
of
those
horrible
stairways
of
brick
and
wood
so
ill
put
together
that
it
is
hard
to
tell
whether
the
wood
is
trying
to
get
rid
of
the
bricks
or
the
bricks
are
trying
to
get
away
from
the
wood
the
gaps
between
them
were
partly
filled
up
by
what
was
dust
in
summer
and
mud
in
winter
the
walls
of
cracked
and
broken
plaster
presented
to
the
eye
more
inscriptions
than
the
academy
of
has
yet
composed
the
portress
stopped
on
the
first
landing
here
monsieur
are
two
rooms
adjoining
each
other
and
very
clean
which
open
opposite
to
those
of
monsieur
bernard
that
s
the
old
gentleman
i
told
you
of
quite
a
proper
person
he
is
decorated
but
it
seems
he
has
had
misfortunes
for
he
never
wears
his
ribbon
they
formerly
had
a
servant
from
the
provinces
but
they
sent
him
away
about
three
years
ago
and
now
the
young
son
of
the
lady
does
everything
housework
and
godefroid
made
a
gesture
oh
cried
the
portress
don
t
you
be
afraid
they
won
t
say
anything
to
you
they
never
speak
to
any
one
they
came
here
after
the
revolution
of
july
in
i
think
they
re
provincial
folk
ruined
by
the
change
of
government
they
are
proud
i
tell
you
and
dumb
as
fishes
for
three
years
monsieur
i
declare
they
have
not
let
me
do
the
smallest
thing
for
them
for
fear
they
should
have
to
pay
for
it
a
hundred
sous
on
new
year
s
day
that
s
all
i
get
out
of
them
talk
to
me
of
authors
indeed
this
gossip
made
godefroid
hope
he
should
get
some
assistance
out
of
the
woman
who
presently
said
while
praising
the
healthfulness
of
the
two
rooms
she
offered
him
that
she
was
not
a
portress
but
the
confidential
agent
of
the
proprietor
for
whom
she
managed
many
of
the
affairs
of
the
house
you
may
have
confidence
in
me
monsieur
that
you
may
madame
vauthier
it
is
well
known
would
rather
have
nothing
than
a
single
penny
that
ought
to
go
to
madame
vauthier
soon
came
to
terms
with
godefroid
who
would
not
take
the
rooms
unless
he
could
have
them
by
the
single
month
and
furnished
these
miserable
rooms
of
students
and
unlucky
authors
were
rented
furnished
or
unfurnished
as
the
case
might
be
the
vast
garret
which
extended
over
the
whole
building
was
filled
with
such
furniture
but
monsieur
bernard
she
said
had
furnished
his
own
rooms
in
making
madame
vauthier
talk
godefroid
discovered
she
had
intended
to
keep
boarders
in
the
building
but
for
the
last
five
years
had
not
obtained
a
single
lodger
of
that
description
she
lived
herself
on
the
facing
towards
the
boulevard
and
looked
after
the
whole
house
by
the
help
of
a
huge
mastiff
a
stout
and
a
lad
who
blacked
the
boots
took
care
of
the
rooms
and
did
the
errands
these
two
servants
were
like
herself
in
keeping
with
the
poverty
of
the
house
that
of
the
tenants
and
the
wild
and
tangled
look
of
the
garden
both
were
children
abandoned
by
their
parents
to
whom
the
widow
gave
food
for
wages
and
what
food
the
lad
whom
godefroid
caught
a
glimpse
of
wore
a
ragged
blouse
and
list
slippers
instead
of
shoes
and
sabots
when
he
went
out
with
his
tousled
head
looking
like
a
sparrow
when
it
takes
a
bath
and
his
black
hands
he
went
to
measure
wood
at
a
on
the
boulevard
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
the
morning
work
of
the
house
and
after
his
day
s
labor
which
ends
in
at
four
in
the
afternoon
he
returned
to
his
domestic
avocations
he
went
to
the
fountain
of
the
observatoire
for
the
water
used
in
the
house
which
the
widow
supplied
to
the
tenants
together
with
bundles
of
kindling
sawed
and
tied
up
by
him
nepomucene
such
was
the
name
of
the
widow
vauthier
s
slave
brought
the
daily
journal
to
his
mistress
in
summer
the
poor
forsaken
lad
was
a
waiter
in
the
at
the
barrier
and
then
his
mistress
dressed
him
properly
as
for
the
stout
girl
she
cooked
under
direction
of
the
widow
and
helped
her
in
another
department
of
industry
during
the
rest
of
the
day
for
madame
vauthier
had
a
business
she
made
list
shoes
which
were
bought
and
sold
by
pedlers
godefroid
learned
all
these
details
in
about
an
hour
s
time
for
the
widow
took
him
everywhere
and
showed
him
the
whole
building
explaining
its
transformation
into
a
dwelling
until
it
had
been
a
nursery
for
less
for
the
silk
than
to
obtain
what
they
call
the
eggs
eleven
acres
planted
with
mulberries
on
the
plain
of
montrouge
and
three
acres
on
the
rue
de
l
ouest
afterwards
built
over
had
supplied
this
singular
establishment
just
as
the
widow
was
explaining
to
godefroid
how
monsieur
barbet
having
lent
money
to
an
italian
named
fresconi
the
manager
of
the
business
could
recover
his
money
only
by
foreclosing
a
mortgage
on
the
building
and
seizing
the
three
acres
on
the
rue
des
champs
a
tall
spare
old
man
with
hair
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
street
which
leads
into
the
square
of
the
rue
de
l
ouest
ah
here
he
comes
just
in
time
cried
the
vauthier
that
s
your
neighbor
monsieur
bernard
monsieur
bernard
she
called
out
as
soon
as
the
old
man
was
within
hearing
you
won
t
be
alone
any
longer
here
is
a
gentleman
who
has
hired
the
rooms
opposite
to
monsieur
bernard
turned
his
eyes
on
godefroid
with
an
apprehension
it
was
easy
to
fathom
the
look
seemed
to
say
the
misfortune
i
feared
has
come
to
monsieur
he
said
aloud
do
you
intend
to
live
here
yes
monsieur
said
godefroid
honestly
it
is
not
a
resort
for
the
fortunate
of
this
earth
and
it
is
the
least
expensive
place
i
can
find
in
the
quarter
madame
vauthier
does
not
pretend
to
lodge
millionnaires
adieu
for
the
present
my
good
madame
vauthier
and
have
everything
ready
for
me
at
six
o
clock
this
evening
i
shall
return
godefroid
turned
toward
the
square
of
the
rue
de
l
ouest
walking
slowly
for
the
anxiety
depicted
on
the
face
of
the
tall
old
man
made
him
think
that
he
would
follow
him
and
come
to
an
explanation
and
in
fact
after
an
instant
s
hesitation
monsieur
bernard
turned
round
and
retraced
his
steps
so
as
to
overtake
godefroid
the
old
villain
he
ll
prevent
him
from
returning
thought
madame
vauthier
that
s
the
second
time
he
has
played
me
the
same
trick
patience
patience
five
days
hence
he
owes
his
rent
and
if
he
doesn
t
pay
sharp
up
i
ll
turn
him
out
monsieur
barbet
is
a
kind
of
a
tiger
one
mustn
t
offend
and
but
i
would
like
to
know
what
he
s
telling
him
felicite
felicite
you
great
gawk
where
are
you
cried
the
widow
in
her
rasping
brutal
voice
she
had
been
using
her
dulcet
tones
to
godefroid
the
stout
and
ran
out
keep
your
eye
on
things
do
you
hear
me
i
shall
be
back
in
five
and
madame
vauthier
formerly
cook
to
the
publisher
barbet
one
of
the
hardest
lenders
of
money
by
the
week
slipped
along
behind
her
two
tenants
so
as
to
be
able
to
overtake
godefroid
as
soon
as
his
conversation
with
monsieur
bernard
came
to
an
end
monsieur
bernard
walked
slowly
like
a
man
who
is
undecided
or
like
a
debtor
seeking
for
excuses
to
placate
a
creditor
who
has
just
left
him
with
threats
godefroid
though
some
distance
in
front
saw
him
while
pretending
to
look
about
and
examine
the
locality
it
was
not
therefore
till
they
reached
the
middle
of
the
great
alley
of
the
garden
of
the
luxembourg
that
monsieur
bernard
came
up
to
the
young
man
pardon
me
monsieur
said
monsieur
bernard
bowing
to
godefroid
who
returned
his
bow
a
thousand
pardons
for
stopping
you
without
having
the
honor
of
your
acquaintance
but
is
it
really
your
intention
to
take
lodgings
in
that
horrible
house
you
have
just
left
but
monsieur
yes
yes
said
the
old
man
interrupting
godefroid
with
a
gesture
of
authority
i
know
that
you
may
well
ask
me
by
what
right
i
meddle
in
your
affairs
and
presume
to
question
you
hear
me
monsieur
you
are
young
and
i
am
old
i
am
older
than
my
years
and
they
are
people
take
me
for
eighty
age
and
misfortunes
justify
many
things
but
i
will
not
make
a
plea
of
my
whitened
head
i
wish
to
speak
of
yourself
do
you
know
that
this
quarter
in
which
you
propose
to
live
is
deserted
by
eight
o
clock
at
night
and
the
roads
are
full
of
dangers
the
least
of
which
is
robbery
have
you
noticed
those
wide
spaces
not
yet
built
upon
these
fields
these
gardens
you
may
tell
me
that
i
live
here
but
monsieur
i
never
go
out
after
six
o
clock
you
may
also
remind
me
of
the
two
young
men
on
the
second
floor
above
the
apartment
you
are
going
to
take
but
monsieur
those
two
poor
men
of
letters
are
pursued
by
creditors
they
are
in
hiding
they
are
away
in
the
daytime
and
only
return
at
night
they
have
no
reason
to
fear
robbers
or
assassins
besides
they
always
go
together
and
are
armed
i
myself
obtained
permission
from
the
prefecture
of
police
that
they
should
carry
monsieur
said
godefroid
i
am
not
afraid
of
robbers
for
the
same
reasons
that
make
those
gentlemen
invulnerable
and
i
despise
life
so
heartily
that
if
i
were
murdered
by
mistake
i
should
bless
the
murderer
you
do
not
look
to
me
very
unhappy
said
the
old
man
examining
godefroid
i
have
at
the
most
enough
to
get
me
bread
to
live
on
and
i
have
come
to
this
place
monsieur
because
of
its
silent
neighborhood
may
i
ask
you
what
interest
you
have
in
driving
me
away
the
old
man
hesitated
he
saw
madame
vauthier
close
behind
them
godefroid
who
examined
him
attentively
was
astonished
at
the
degree
of
thinness
to
which
grief
perhaps
hunger
perhaps
toil
had
reduced
him
there
were
signs
of
all
those
causes
upon
that
face
where
the
parched
skin
clung
to
the
bones
as
if
it
had
been
burned
by
the
sun
of
africa
the
dome
of
the
forehead
high
and
threatening
overshadowed
a
pair
of
eyes
two
cold
hard
sagacious
penetrating
eyes
like
those
of
savages
surrounded
by
a
black
and
wrinkled
circle
the
large
nose
long
and
very
thin
and
the
prominent
chin
gave
the
old
man
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
mask
popularly
ascribed
to
don
quixote
but
a
wicked
don
quixote
without
illusions
a
terrible
don
quixote
and
yet
the
old
man
in
spite
of
this
general
aspect
of
severity
betrayed
the
weakness
and
timidity
which
indigence
imparts
to
all
unfortunates
these
two
emotions
seemed
to
have
made
crevices
in
that
solidly
constructed
face
which
the
pickaxe
of
poverty
was
daily
enlarging
the
mouth
was
eloquent
and
grave
in
that
feature
don
quixote
was
complicated
with
montesquieu
s
president
his
clothing
was
entirely
of
black
cloth
but
cloth
that
was
white
at
the
seams
the
coat
of
an
cut
and
the
trousers
showed
various
clumsy
darns
the
buttons
had
evidently
just
been
renewed
the
coat
buttoned
to
the
chin
showed
no
linen
and
the
cravat
of
a
rusty
black
hid
the
greater
part
of
a
false
collar
these
clothes
worn
for
many
years
smelt
of
poverty
and
yet
the
lofty
air
of
this
mysterious
old
man
his
gait
the
thought
that
dwelt
on
his
brow
and
was
manifest
in
his
eyes
excluded
the
idea
of
pauperism
an
observer
would
have
hesitated
how
to
class
him
monsieur
bernard
seemed
so
absorbed
that
he
might
have
been
taken
for
a
teacher
employed
in
that
quarter
of
the
city
or
for
some
learned
man
plunged
in
exacting
and
tyrannical
meditation
godefroid
in
any
case
would
have
felt
a
curiosity
which
his
present
mission
of
benevolence
sharpened
into
powerful
interest
monsieur
continued
the
old
man
if
i
were
sure
that
you
are
really
seeking
silence
and
seclusion
i
should
say
take
those
rooms
near
he
raised
his
voice
so
that
madame
vauthier
who
was
now
passing
them
could
hear
him
take
those
rooms
i
am
a
father
monsieur
i
have
only
a
daughter
and
a
grandson
to
enable
me
to
bear
the
miseries
of
life
now
my
daughter
needs
silence
and
absolute
tranquillity
all
those
persons
who
so
far
have
looked
at
the
rooms
you
are
now
considering
have
listened
to
the
reasons
and
the
entreaties
of
a
despairing
father
it
was
indifferent
to
them
whether
they
lived
in
one
house
or
another
of
a
quarter
so
deserted
that
plenty
of
lodgings
can
be
had
for
a
low
price
but
i
see
in
you
a
fixed
determination
and
i
beg
you
monsieur
not
to
deceive
me
do
you
really
desire
a
quiet
life
if
not
i
shall
be
forced
to
move
and
go
beyond
the
barrier
and
the
removal
may
cost
me
my
daughter
s
if
the
man
could
have
wept
the
tears
would
have
covered
his
cheeks
while
he
spoke
as
it
was
they
were
to
use
an
expression
now
become
vulgar
in
his
he
covered
his
forehead
with
his
hand
which
was
nothing
but
bones
and
muscle
what
is
your
daughter
s
illness
asked
godefroid
in
a
persuasive
and
sympathetic
voice
a
terrible
disease
to
which
physicians
give
various
names
but
it
has
in
truth
no
name
my
fortune
is
lost
he
added
with
one
of
those
despairing
gestures
made
only
by
the
wretched
the
little
money
that
i
had
for
in
i
was
cast
from
a
high
position
in
fact
all
that
i
possessed
was
soon
used
by
on
my
daughter
s
illness
her
mother
too
was
ruined
by
it
and
finally
her
husband
the
pension
i
receive
from
the
government
barely
suffices
for
the
actual
necessities
of
my
poor
dear
saintly
child
the
faculty
of
tears
has
left
me
i
have
suffered
tortures
monsieur
i
must
be
granite
not
to
have
died
but
no
god
had
kept
alive
the
father
that
the
child
might
have
a
nurse
a
providence
her
poor
mother
died
of
the
strain
ah
you
have
come
young
man
at
a
moment
when
the
old
tree
that
never
yet
has
bent
feels
the
axe
the
axe
of
poverty
sharpened
by
sorrow
at
his
roots
yes
here
am
i
who
never
complain
talking
to
you
of
this
illness
so
as
to
prevent
you
from
coming
to
the
house
or
if
you
still
persist
to
implore
you
not
to
trouble
our
peace
monsieur
at
this
moment
my
daughter
barks
like
a
dog
day
and
is
she
insane
asked
godefroid
her
mind
is
sound
she
is
a
saint
replied
the
old
man
you
will
presently
think
i
am
mad
when
i
tell
you
all
monsieur
my
only
child
my
daughter
was
born
of
a
mother
in
excellent
health
i
never
in
my
life
loved
but
one
woman
the
one
i
married
i
married
the
daughter
of
one
of
the
bravest
colonels
of
the
imperial
guard
tarlowski
a
pole
formerly
on
the
staff
of
the
emperor
the
functions
that
i
exercised
in
my
high
position
demanded
the
utmost
purity
of
life
and
morals
but
i
have
never
had
room
in
my
heart
for
many
feelings
and
i
faithfully
loved
my
wife
who
deserved
such
love
i
am
a
father
in
like
manner
as
i
was
a
husband
and
that
is
telling
you
all
in
one
word
my
daughter
never
left
her
mother
no
child
has
ever
lived
more
chastely
more
truly
a
christian
life
than
my
dear
daughter
she
was
born
more
than
pretty
she
was
born
most
beautiful
and
her
husband
a
young
man
of
whose
morals
i
was
absolutely
sure
he
was
the
son
of
a
friend
of
mine
the
judge
of
one
of
the
royal
courts
did
not
in
any
way
contribute
to
my
daughter
s
godefroid
and
monsieur
bernard
made
an
involuntary
pause
and
looked
at
each
other
marriage
as
you
know
sometimes
changes
a
young
woman
greatly
resumed
the
old
man
the
first
pregnancy
passed
well
and
produced
a
son
my
grandson
who
now
lives
with
us
the
last
scion
of
two
families
the
second
pregnancy
was
accompanied
by
such
extraordinary
symptoms
that
the
physicians
much
astonished
attributed
them
to
the
caprice
of
phenomena
which
sometimes
manifest
themselves
in
this
state
and
are
recorded
by
physicians
in
the
annals
of
science
my
daughter
gave
birth
to
a
dead
child
in
fact
it
was
twisted
and
smothered
by
internal
movements
the
disease
had
begun
the
pregnancy
counted
for
nothing
perhaps
you
are
a
student
of
medicine
godefroid
made
a
sign
which
answered
as
well
for
affirmation
as
for
negation
after
this
terrible
confinement
resumed
monsieur
bernard
so
terrible
and
laborious
that
it
made
a
violent
impression
on
my
and
began
the
mortal
melancholy
of
which
he
died
my
daughter
two
or
three
months
later
complained
of
a
general
weakness
affecting
particularly
her
feet
which
she
declared
felt
like
cottonwood
this
debility
changed
to
paralysis
and
what
a
paralysis
my
daughter
s
feet
and
legs
can
be
bent
or
twisted
in
any
way
and
she
does
not
feel
it
the
limbs
are
there
apparently
without
blood
or
muscles
or
bones
this
affection
which
is
not
connected
with
anything
known
to
science
spread
to
the
arms
and
hands
and
we
then
supposed
it
to
be
a
disease
of
the
spinal
cord
doctors
and
remedies
only
made
matters
worse
until
at
last
my
poor
daughter
could
not
be
moved
without
dislocating
either
the
shoulders
the
arms
or
the
knees
i
kept
an
admirable
surgeon
almost
constantly
in
the
house
who
with
the
doctor
or
doctors
for
many
came
out
of
interest
in
the
case
replaced
the
dislocated
limbs
sometimes
would
you
believe
it
monsieur
three
and
four
times
a
day
ah
this
disease
has
so
many
forms
that
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
during
the
first
period
of
weakness
before
the
paralysis
began
the
strangest
signs
of
catalepsy
appeared
you
know
what
catalepsy
is
she
remained
for
days
with
her
eyes
wide
open
motionless
in
whatever
position
she
was
when
the
attack
seized
her
the
worst
symptoms
of
that
strange
affection
were
shown
even
those
of
lockjaw
this
phase
of
her
illness
suggested
to
me
the
idea
of
employing
magnetism
and
i
was
about
to
do
so
when
the
paralysis
began
my
daughter
monsieur
has
a
miraculous
her
soul
has
been
the
theatre
of
all
the
wonders
of
somnambulism
just
as
her
body
has
been
that
of
all
godefroid
began
to
ask
himself
if
the
old
man
were
really
sane
so
that
i
continued
monsieur
bernard
paying
no
attention
to
the
expression
in
godefroid
s
eyes
even
i
a
child
of
the
eighteenth
century
fed
on
voltaire
diderot
helvetius
i
a
son
of
the
revolution
who
scoff
at
all
that
antiquity
and
the
tell
us
of
demoniacal
possession
well
monsieur
i
affirm
that
nothing
but
such
possession
can
explain
the
condition
of
my
child
as
a
somnambulist
she
has
never
been
able
to
tell
us
the
cause
of
her
sufferings
she
has
never
perceived
it
and
all
the
remedies
she
has
proposed
when
in
that
state
though
carefully
carried
out
have
done
her
no
good
for
instance
she
wished
to
be
wrapped
in
the
carcass
of
a
freshly
killed
pig
then
she
ordered
us
to
run
the
sharp
points
of
magnets
into
her
legs
and
to
put
hot
on
her
spine
godefroid
looked
at
him
in
amazement
and
then
what
endless
other
troubles
monsieur
her
teeth
fell
out
she
became
deaf
then
dumb
and
then
after
six
months
of
absolute
dumbness
utter
deafness
speech
and
hearing
have
returned
to
her
she
recovered
just
as
capriciously
as
she
had
lost
the
use
of
her
hands
but
her
feet
have
continued
in
the
same
hapless
condition
for
the
last
seven
years
she
has
shown
marked
and
symptoms
of
hydrophobia
not
only
does
the
sight
of
water
the
sound
of
water
the
presence
of
a
glass
or
a
cup
fling
her
at
times
into
a
state
of
fury
but
she
barks
like
a
dog
that
melancholy
bark
or
rather
howl
a
dog
utters
when
he
hears
an
organ
several
times
we
have
thought
her
dying
and
the
priests
had
administered
the
last
sacraments
but
she
has
always
returned
to
life
to
suffer
with
her
full
reason
and
the
most
absolute
clearness
of
mind
for
her
faculties
of
heart
and
soul
are
still
untouched
though
she
has
lived
monsieur
she
has
caused
the
deaths
of
her
mother
and
her
husband
who
have
not
been
able
to
endure
the
suffering
of
such
scenes
alas
monsieur
those
distressing
scenes
are
becoming
worse
all
the
natural
functions
are
perverted
the
faculty
alone
can
explain
the
strange
aberration
of
the
organs
she
was
in
this
state
when
i
brought
her
from
the
provinces
to
paris
in
because
the
two
or
three
distinguished
doctors
to
whom
i
wrote
desplein
bianchon
and
haudry
thought
from
my
letters
that
i
was
telling
them
fables
magnetism
was
then
energetically
denied
by
all
the
schools
of
medicine
and
without
saying
that
they
doubted
either
my
word
or
that
of
the
provincial
doctors
they
said
we
could
not
have
observed
thoroughly
or
else
we
had
been
misled
by
the
exaggeration
which
patients
are
apt
to
indulge
in
but
they
were
forced
to
change
their
minds
when
they
saw
my
daughter
and
it
is
to
the
phenomena
they
then
observed
that
the
great
researches
made
in
these
latter
days
are
owing
for
i
must
tell
you
that
they
class
my
daughter
s
singular
state
as
a
form
of
neurosis
at
the
last
consultation
of
these
gentlemen
they
decided
to
stop
all
medicines
to
let
nature
alone
and
study
it
since
then
i
have
had
but
one
doctor
and
he
is
the
doctor
who
attends
the
poor
of
this
quarter
we
do
nothing
for
her
now
but
alleviate
pain
for
we
know
not
the
cause
of
here
the
old
man
stopped
as
if
overcome
with
his
harrowing
confidence
for
the
last
five
years
he
continued
my
daughter
alternates
between
revivals
and
relapses
but
no
new
phenomena
have
appeared
she
suffers
more
or
less
from
the
varied
nervous
attacks
i
have
briefly
described
to
you
but
the
paralysis
of
the
legs
and
the
derangement
of
the
natural
functions
are
constant
the
poverty
into
which
we
fell
and
which
alas
is
only
increasing
obliged
me
to
leave
the
rooms
that
i
took
in
in
the
faubourg
du
roule
my
daughter
can
not
endure
the
fatigue
of
moving
i
came
near
losing
her
when
i
brought
her
to
paris
and
again
when
i
removed
her
to
this
house
here
my
worst
financial
misfortunes
have
come
upon
me
after
thirty
years
in
the
public
service
i
was
made
to
wait
four
years
before
my
pension
was
granted
i
have
only
received
it
during
the
last
six
months
and
even
then
the
new
government
has
sternly
cut
it
down
to
the
godefroid
made
a
gesture
of
surprise
which
seemed
to
ask
for
a
more
complete
confidence
the
old
man
so
understood
it
for
he
answered
immediately
casting
a
reproachful
glance
to
heaven
i
am
one
of
the
thousand
victims
of
political
reaction
i
conceal
my
name
because
it
is
the
mark
for
many
a
revenge
if
the
lessons
of
experience
were
not
always
wasted
from
one
generation
to
another
i
should
warn
you
young
man
never
to
adopt
the
sternness
of
any
policy
not
that
i
regret
having
done
my
duty
my
conscience
is
perfectly
clear
on
that
score
but
the
powers
of
have
not
that
solidarity
which
formerly
bound
all
governments
together
as
governments
no
matter
how
different
they
might
be
if
they
reward
zealous
agents
it
is
because
they
are
afraid
of
them
the
instrument
they
have
used
no
matter
how
faithful
it
has
been
is
sooner
or
later
cast
aside
you
see
in
me
one
of
the
firmest
supporters
of
the
government
of
the
elder
branch
of
the
bourbons
as
i
was
later
of
the
imperial
power
yet
here
i
am
in
penury
since
i
am
too
proud
to
beg
they
have
never
dreamed
that
i
suffer
untold
misery
five
days
ago
monsieur
the
doctor
who
takes
care
of
my
daughter
or
rather
i
should
say
observes
her
told
me
that
he
was
unable
to
cure
a
disease
the
forms
of
which
varied
perpetually
he
says
that
neurotic
patients
are
the
despair
of
science
for
the
causes
of
their
conditions
are
only
to
be
found
in
some
as
yet
unexplored
system
he
advised
me
to
have
recourse
to
a
physician
who
has
been
called
a
quack
but
he
carefully
pointed
out
that
this
man
was
a
stranger
a
polish
jew
a
refugee
and
that
the
parisian
doctors
were
extremely
jealous
of
certain
wonderful
cures
he
had
made
and
also
of
the
opinion
expressed
by
many
that
he
is
very
learned
and
extremely
able
only
berton
says
he
is
very
exacting
and
overbearing
he
selects
his
patients
and
will
not
allow
an
instant
of
his
time
to
be
wasted
and
he
is
a
communist
his
name
is
halpersohn
my
grandson
has
been
twice
to
find
him
but
he
is
always
too
busy
to
attend
to
him
he
has
not
been
to
see
us
i
fully
understand
why
asked
godefroid
because
my
grandson
who
is
sixteen
years
old
is
even
more
shabbily
dressed
than
i
am
would
you
believe
it
monsieur
i
not
go
to
that
doctor
my
clothes
are
so
out
of
keeping
with
a
man
of
my
age
and
dignity
if
he
saw
the
father
as
shabby
as
i
am
and
the
boy
even
worse
he
might
not
give
my
daughter
the
needful
attention
he
would
treat
us
as
doctors
treat
the
poor
and
think
my
dear
monsieur
that
i
love
my
daughter
for
all
the
suffering
she
has
caused
me
just
as
i
used
to
love
her
for
the
joys
i
had
in
her
she
has
become
angelic
alas
she
is
nothing
now
but
a
soul
a
soul
which
beams
upon
her
son
and
me
the
body
no
longer
exists
she
has
conquered
suffering
think
what
a
spectacle
for
a
father
the
whole
world
to
my
daughter
is
within
the
walls
of
her
room
i
keep
it
filled
with
flowers
for
she
loves
them
she
reads
a
great
deal
and
when
she
has
the
use
of
her
hands
she
works
like
a
fairy
she
has
no
conception
of
the
horrible
poverty
to
which
we
are
reduced
this
makes
our
household
way
of
life
so
strange
so
eccentric
that
we
can
not
admit
visitors
do
you
now
understand
me
monsieur
can
you
not
see
how
impossible
a
neighbor
is
i
should
have
to
ask
for
so
much
forbearance
from
him
that
the
obligation
would
be
too
heavy
besides
i
have
no
time
for
friends
i
educate
my
grandson
and
i
have
so
much
other
work
to
do
that
i
only
sleep
three
or
at
most
four
hours
at
monsieur
said
godefroid
who
had
listened
patiently
observing
the
old
man
with
sorrowful
attention
i
will
be
your
neighbor
and
i
will
help
a
scornful
gesture
even
an
impatient
one
escaped
the
old
man
for
he
was
one
who
believed
in
nothing
good
in
human
nature
i
will
help
you
pursued
godefroid
taking
his
hand
but
in
my
own
way
listen
to
me
what
do
you
mean
to
make
of
your
grandson
he
is
soon
to
enter
the
law
school
i
am
bringing
him
up
to
the
then
he
will
cost
you
six
hundred
francs
a
the
old
man
made
no
reply
i
myself
continued
godefroid
after
a
pause
have
nothing
but
i
may
be
able
to
do
much
i
will
obtain
the
polish
doctor
for
you
and
if
your
daughter
is
curable
she
shall
be
cured
we
will
find
some
way
of
paying
oh
if
my
daughter
be
cured
i
will
make
a
sacrifice
i
can
make
but
once
cried
the
old
man
i
will
sell
the
pear
i
have
kept
for
a
thirsty
you
shall
keep
the
pear
oh
youth
youth
exclaimed
monsieur
bernard
shaking
his
head
adieu
monsieur
or
rather
au
revoir
this
is
the
hour
for
the
library
and
as
my
books
are
all
sold
i
am
obliged
to
go
there
every
day
to
do
my
work
i
shall
bear
in
mind
the
kindness
you
express
but
i
must
wait
and
see
whether
you
will
grant
us
the
consideration
i
must
ask
from
my
neighbor
that
is
all
i
expect
of
yes
monsieur
let
me
be
your
neighbor
for
i
assure
you
barbet
is
not
a
man
to
allow
the
rooms
to
be
long
unrented
and
you
might
have
far
worse
neighbors
than
i
do
not
ask
you
to
believe
in
me
only
to
let
me
be
useful
to
what
object
have
you
said
the
old
man
preparing
to
go
down
the
steps
from
the
cloister
of
the
chartreux
which
leads
from
the
great
alley
of
the
luxembourg
to
the
rue
d
enfer
did
you
never
in
your
public
functions
oblige
any
one
the
old
man
looked
at
godefroid
with
frowning
brows
his
eyes
were
full
of
memories
like
a
man
who
turns
the
leaves
of
his
book
of
life
seeking
for
the
action
to
which
he
owed
this
gratitude
then
he
turned
away
coldly
with
a
bow
full
of
doubt
well
for
a
first
investigation
i
did
not
frighten
him
too
much
thought
godefroid
xiii
further
investigations
godefroid
now
went
to
the
rue
d
enfer
the
address
given
him
by
monsieur
alain
and
there
found
berton
a
cold
grave
man
who
astonished
him
much
by
confirming
all
the
details
given
by
monsieur
bernard
about
his
daughter
s
illness
from
him
godefroid
obtained
the
address
of
halpersohn
this
polish
doctor
since
so
celebrated
then
lived
in
chaillot
rue
marbeuf
in
an
isolated
house
where
he
occupied
the
first
floor
general
romanus
zarnowski
lived
on
the
second
floor
and
the
servants
of
the
two
refugees
inhabited
the
garret
of
this
little
house
which
had
but
two
stories
godefroid
did
not
find
halpersohn
and
was
told
that
he
had
gone
into
the
provinces
sent
for
by
a
rich
patient
he
was
almost
glad
not
to
meet
him
for
in
his
hurry
he
had
forgotten
to
supply
himself
with
money
and
he
now
went
back
to
the
hotel
de
la
chanterie
to
get
some
these
various
trips
and
the
time
consumed
in
dining
at
a
restaurant
in
the
rue
de
l
odeon
brought
godefroid
to
the
hour
when
he
said
he
would
return
and
take
possession
of
his
lodging
on
the
boulevard
du
nothing
could
be
more
forlorn
than
the
manner
in
which
madame
vauthier
had
furnished
the
two
rooms
it
seemed
as
though
the
woman
let
rooms
with
the
express
purpose
that
no
one
should
stay
in
them
evidently
the
bed
chairs
tables
bureau
secretary
curtains
came
from
forced
sales
at
auction
articles
massed
together
in
lots
as
having
no
separate
intrinsic
value
madame
vauthier
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
stood
waiting
for
thanks
she
took
godefroid
s
smile
for
one
of
surprise
there
i
picked
out
for
you
the
very
best
we
have
my
dear
monsieur
godefroid
she
said
with
a
triumphant
air
see
those
pretty
silk
curtains
and
the
mahogany
bedstead
which
hasn
t
got
a
in
it
it
formerly
belonged
to
the
prince
of
wissembourg
when
he
left
his
house
rue
in
i
was
the
from
there
i
went
to
live
as
cook
with
the
present
owner
of
this
godefroid
stopped
the
flux
of
confidences
by
paying
a
month
s
rent
in
advance
and
he
also
gave
in
advance
the
six
francs
he
was
to
pay
madame
vauthier
for
the
care
of
his
rooms
at
that
moment
he
heard
barking
and
if
he
had
not
been
duly
warned
by
monsieur
bernard
he
would
certainly
have
supposed
that
his
neighbor
kept
a
dog
does
that
dog
bark
at
night
he
asked
oh
don
t
be
uneasy
monsieur
you
ll
only
have
one
week
to
stand
those
persons
monsieur
bernard
can
t
pay
his
rent
and
we
are
going
to
put
him
out
they
are
queer
people
i
tell
you
i
have
never
seen
their
dog
that
animal
is
sometimes
months
yes
six
months
at
a
time
without
making
a
sound
you
might
think
they
hadn
t
a
dog
the
beast
never
leaves
the
lady
s
room
there
s
a
sick
lady
in
there
and
very
sick
too
she
s
never
been
out
of
her
room
since
she
came
old
monsieur
bernard
works
hard
and
the
son
too
the
lad
is
a
at
the
school
of
where
he
is
nearly
through
his
philosophy
course
and
only
sixteen
too
that
s
something
to
boast
of
but
the
little
scamp
has
to
work
like
one
possessed
presently
you
ll
hear
them
bring
out
the
plants
they
keep
in
the
lady
s
room
and
carry
in
fresh
ones
they
themselves
the
grandfather
and
the
boy
only
eat
bread
though
they
buy
flowers
and
all
sorts
of
dainties
for
the
lady
she
must
be
very
ill
not
to
leave
her
room
once
since
entering
it
and
if
one
s
to
believe
monsieur
berton
the
doctor
she
ll
never
come
out
except
feet
what
does
this
monsieur
bernard
do
it
seems
he
s
a
learned
man
he
writes
and
goes
about
to
libraries
monsieur
lends
him
money
on
his
monsieur
who
is
he
the
proprietor
of
the
house
monsieur
barbet
the
old
bookseller
he
is
a
norman
who
used
to
sell
green
stuff
in
the
streets
and
afterwards
set
up
a
bookstall
in
on
the
quay
then
he
got
a
little
shop
and
now
he
is
very
rich
he
is
a
kind
of
a
jew
with
a
score
of
trades
he
was
even
a
partner
with
the
italian
who
built
this
barrack
to
lodge
so
this
house
is
a
refuge
for
unfortunate
authors
said
godefroid
is
monsieur
unluckily
one
himself
asked
the
widow
vauthier
i
am
only
just
starting
replied
godefroid
oh
my
dear
monsieur
take
my
advice
and
don
t
go
on
journalist
well
i
won
t
say
anything
against
godefroid
could
not
help
laughing
as
he
bade
to
the
portress
who
thus
all
unconsciously
represented
the
bourgeoisie
as
he
went
to
bed
in
the
horrible
room
floored
with
bricks
that
were
not
even
colored
and
hung
with
a
paper
at
seven
sous
a
roll
godefroid
not
only
regretted
his
little
rooms
in
the
rue
chanoinesse
but
also
the
society
of
madame
de
la
chanterie
he
felt
a
void
in
his
soul
he
had
already
acquired
habits
of
mind
and
could
not
remember
to
have
so
keenly
regretted
anything
in
all
his
former
life
as
this
break
in
his
new
existence
these
thoughts
as
they
pressed
upon
him
had
a
great
effect
upon
his
soul
he
felt
that
no
life
could
compare
in
value
with
the
one
he
sought
to
embrace
and
his
resolution
to
emulate
the
good
old
alain
became
unshakable
without
having
any
vocation
for
the
work
he
had
the
will
to
do
it
the
next
day
godefroid
already
habituated
by
his
new
life
to
rising
early
saw
from
his
window
a
young
man
about
seventeen
years
of
age
dressed
in
a
blouse
who
was
coming
back
no
doubt
from
the
public
fountain
bringing
a
crock
full
of
water
in
each
hand
the
face
of
this
lad
who
was
not
aware
that
he
was
seen
revealed
his
feelings
and
never
had
godefroid
observed
one
so
artless
and
so
melancholy
the
graces
of
youth
were
all
repressed
by
poverty
by
study
by
great
physical
fatigue
monsieur
bernard
s
grandson
was
remarkable
for
a
complexion
of
extreme
whiteness
which
the
contrast
with
his
dark
hair
seemed
to
make
still
whiter
he
made
three
trips
when
he
returned
from
the
last
he
saw
some
men
unloading
a
cord
of
wood
which
godefroid
had
ordered
the
night
before
for
the
winter
of
was
beginning
to
be
felt
snow
had
fallen
slightly
during
the
night
nepomucene
who
had
begun
his
day
by
going
for
the
wood
on
which
madame
vauthier
levied
a
handsome
tribute
spoke
to
the
young
lad
while
waiting
until
the
woodman
had
sawed
enough
for
him
to
carry
upstairs
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
sudden
cold
was
causing
anxiety
to
monsieur
bernard
s
grandson
and
that
the
sight
of
the
wood
as
well
as
that
of
the
threatening
sky
warned
him
that
they
ought
to
be
making
their
own
provision
for
wintry
weather
suddenly
however
as
if
reproaching
himself
for
lost
time
he
seized
his
crocks
and
hastily
entered
the
house
it
was
in
fact
seven
o
clock
the
hour
was
just
ringing
from
the
belfry
of
the
convent
of
the
visitation
and
he
was
due
at
the
college
of
by
eight
as
the
young
lad
entered
the
house
godefroid
went
to
his
door
to
admit
madame
vauthier
who
brought
her
new
lodger
the
wherewithal
to
make
a
fire
and
he
thus
became
the
witness
of
a
scene
which
took
place
on
the
landing
a
neighboring
gardener
who
had
rung
several
times
at
monsieur
bernard
s
door
without
making
any
one
hear
for
the
bell
was
wrapped
in
paper
had
a
rather
rough
dispute
with
the
young
lad
who
now
came
up
with
the
water
demanding
to
be
paid
for
the
flowers
he
had
supplied
as
the
man
raised
his
voice
angrily
monsieur
bernard
appeared
auguste
he
said
to
his
grandson
dress
yourself
it
is
time
for
he
himself
took
the
two
crocks
of
water
carried
them
into
the
first
of
his
rooms
in
which
were
many
pots
of
flowers
and
returned
to
speak
to
the
gardener
carefully
closing
the
door
behind
him
godefroid
s
door
was
open
for
nepomucene
had
begun
his
trips
and
was
stacking
the
wood
in
the
front
room
the
gardener
was
silent
in
presence
of
monsieur
bernard
whose
tall
figure
robed
in
a
violet
silk
buttoned
to
the
throat
gave
him
an
imposing
air
you
might
ask
for
what
is
owing
to
you
without
such
noise
said
monsieur
bernard
be
fair
my
dear
monsieur
said
the
gardener
you
agreed
to
pay
me
every
week
and
it
now
three
months
ten
weeks
since
i
have
had
a
penny
you
owe
me
a
hundred
and
twenty
francs
we
let
out
our
plants
to
rich
people
who
pay
us
when
we
ask
for
the
money
but
this
is
the
fifth
time
i
have
come
to
you
for
it
i
have
my
rent
to
pay
and
the
wages
of
my
men
i
am
not
a
bit
richer
than
you
my
wife
who
supplied
you
with
eggs
and
milk
will
not
come
here
any
more
you
owe
her
thirty
francs
she
does
not
like
to
dun
you
for
she
is
that
she
is
if
i
listened
to
her
i
couldn
t
do
business
at
all
and
so
i
who
am
not
so
soft
you
understand
just
then
auguste
came
out
dressed
in
a
shabby
little
green
coat
with
cloth
trousers
of
the
same
color
a
black
cravat
and
boots
these
clothes
though
carefully
brushed
showed
the
lowest
degree
of
poverty
they
were
all
too
short
and
too
narrow
so
that
the
lad
seemed
likely
to
crack
them
at
every
motion
the
seams
were
white
the
edges
curled
the
buttonholes
torn
in
spite
of
many
mendings
the
whole
presenting
to
the
most
unobservant
eyes
the
stigmas
of
honest
penury
this
livery
contrasted
sadly
with
the
youth
of
the
lad
who
now
disappeared
munching
a
crust
of
stale
bread
with
his
strong
and
handsome
teeth
he
breakfasted
thus
on
his
way
to
the
rue
carrying
his
books
and
papers
under
his
arm
and
wearing
a
little
cap
much
too
small
for
his
head
from
which
stuck
out
a
mass
of
magnificent
black
hair
in
passing
before
his
grandfather
the
lad
had
given
him
rapidly
a
look
of
deep
distress
for
he
knew
him
to
be
in
an
almost
hopeless
difficulty
the
consequences
of
which
might
be
terrible
to
leave
room
for
the
boy
to
pass
the
gardener
had
stepped
back
to
the
sill
of
godefroid
s
door
and
as
at
that
moment
nepomucene
arrived
with
a
quantity
of
wood
the
creditor
was
forced
to
retreat
into
the
room
monsieur
bernard
cried
the
widow
vauthier
do
you
think
monsieur
godefroid
hired
his
rooms
to
have
you
hold
your
meetings
in
them
excuse
me
madame
said
the
gardener
but
there
was
no
room
on
the
i
didn
t
say
that
for
you
monsieur
cartier
said
the
widow
remain
where
you
are
cried
godefroid
addressing
the
gardener
and
you
my
dear
neighbor
he
added
looking
at
monsieur
bernard
who
seemed
insensible
to
the
cruel
insult
if
it
is
convenient
to
you
to
have
an
explanation
with
your
gardener
in
my
room
come
the
old
man
half
stupefied
with
his
troubles
cast
a
look
of
gratitude
on
godefroid
as
for
you
my
dear
madame
vauthier
continued
godefroid
don
t
be
so
rough
with
monsieur
who
is
in
the
first
place
an
old
man
and
one
to
whom
you
owe
the
obligation
of
my
lodging
oh
pooh
said
the
widow
besides
if
poor
people
do
not
help
each
other
who
will
help
them
leave
us
madame
vauthier
i
ll
blow
the
fire
myself
have
the
rest
of
my
wood
put
in
your
cellar
i
am
sure
you
will
take
good
care
of
madame
vauthier
disappeared
for
godefroid
in
telling
her
to
take
care
of
his
wood
had
given
an
opportunity
to
her
greed
come
in
this
way
said
godefroid
offering
chairs
to
both
debtor
and
creditor
the
old
man
conversed
standing
but
the
gardener
sat
down
my
good
monsieur
cartier
went
on
godefroid
rich
people
do
not
pay
as
regularly
as
you
say
they
do
and
you
ought
not
to
dun
a
worthy
man
for
a
few
louis
monsieur
draws
his
pension
every
six
months
and
he
could
not
make
you
an
assignment
of
it
for
such
a
paltry
sum
i
am
willing
to
advance
the
money
if
you
absolutely
insist
on
having
monsieur
bernard
drew
his
pension
two
weeks
ago
and
has
not
paid
me
i
am
sorry
to
trouble
him
of
have
you
furnished
him
with
plants
all
along
yes
monsieur
for
six
years
and
he
has
always
paid
monsieur
bernard
who
was
listening
to
some
sound
in
his
own
rooms
and
paying
no
attention
to
what
was
being
said
now
heard
a
cry
through
the
partitions
and
hurried
away
without
a
word
come
come
my
good
man
said
godefroid
taking
advantage
of
the
old
man
s
absence
bring
some
nice
flowers
your
best
flowers
this
very
morning
and
tell
your
wife
to
send
the
eggs
and
milk
as
usual
i
will
pay
you
this
cartier
looked
oddly
at
godefroid
then
you
must
know
more
than
madame
vauthier
does
she
sent
me
word
to
hurry
if
i
hoped
to
be
paid
he
said
neither
she
nor
i
can
make
out
why
folks
who
eat
nothing
but
bread
and
the
odds
and
ends
of
vegetables
bits
of
carrots
turnips
and
such
things
which
they
get
at
the
of
restaurants
yes
monsieur
i
assure
you
i
came
one
day
on
the
little
fellow
filling
an
old
handbag
well
i
want
to
know
why
such
persons
spend
nearly
forty
francs
a
month
on
flowers
they
say
the
old
man
s
pension
is
only
three
thousand
at
any
rate
said
godefroid
it
is
not
your
business
to
complain
if
they
ruin
themselves
in
that
s
true
monsieur
provided
they
pay
bring
your
bill
to
very
good
monsieur
said
the
gardener
with
a
tinge
of
respect
monsieur
no
doubt
wants
to
see
the
mysterious
my
good
friend
said
godefroid
stiffly
you
forget
yourself
go
home
now
and
bring
fresh
plants
for
those
you
are
to
take
away
if
you
can
also
supply
me
with
good
cream
and
fresh
eggs
i
will
take
them
and
i
will
go
this
morning
and
take
a
look
at
your
it
is
one
of
the
finest
in
paris
monsieur
i
exhibit
at
the
luxembourg
my
garden
which
covers
three
acres
is
on
the
boulevard
behind
the
garden
of
la
very
good
monsieur
cartier
you
are
i
see
much
richer
than
i
have
some
consideration
for
us
therefore
who
knows
how
soon
we
may
have
mutual
need
of
each
other
the
gardener
went
away
much
puzzled
as
to
who
and
what
godefroid
might
be
and
yet
i
was
once
just
like
that
thought
godefroid
blowing
his
fire
what
a
fine
specimen
of
the
bourgeois
of
gossiping
inquisitive
crazy
for
equality
jealous
of
his
customers
furious
at
not
knowing
why
a
poor
sick
woman
stays
in
her
room
without
being
seen
concealing
his
wealth
and
yet
vain
enough
to
betray
it
when
he
thinks
it
will
put
him
above
his
neighbor
that
man
ought
to
be
the
lieutenant
of
his
company
i
dare
say
he
is
with
what
ease
he
plays
the
scene
of
monsieur
dimanche
a
little
more
and
i
should
have
made
a
friend
of
monsieur
the
old
man
broke
into
this
soliloquy
which
proves
how
godefroid
s
ideas
had
changed
in
four
months
excuse
me
neighbor
said
monsieur
bernard
in
a
troubled
voice
i
see
you
have
sent
that
gardener
away
satisfied
for
he
bowed
civilly
to
me
on
the
landing
it
seems
young
man
as
if
providence
had
sent
you
to
me
at
the
very
moment
when
i
was
about
to
succumb
alas
the
hard
talk
of
that
man
must
have
shown
you
many
things
it
is
true
that
i
received
the
payment
of
my
pension
two
weeks
ago
but
i
had
more
pressing
debts
than
his
and
i
was
forced
to
put
aside
my
rent
for
fear
of
being
turned
out
of
the
house
i
have
told
you
the
state
my
daughter
is
in
and
you
have
probably
heard
he
looked
uneasily
at
godefroid
who
made
him
an
affirmative
sign
well
then
you
know
it
would
be
her
death
warrant
for
i
should
then
be
compelled
to
put
her
in
a
hospital
my
grandson
and
i
were
fearing
that
end
this
morning
but
we
do
not
dread
cartier
so
much
as
we
do
the
my
dear
monsieur
bernard
said
godefroid
i
have
plenty
of
wood
take
all
you
ah
said
the
old
man
but
how
can
i
ever
return
such
services
by
accepting
them
without
difficulty
said
godefroid
quickly
and
by
giving
me
your
but
what
are
my
claims
to
so
much
generosity
asked
monsieur
bernard
becoming
once
more
distrustful
ah
my
pride
and
that
of
my
grandson
are
lowered
indeed
he
cried
bitterly
we
are
compelled
to
offer
explanations
to
the
few
creditors
only
two
or
three
whom
we
can
not
pay
the
utterly
unfortunate
have
no
creditors
to
have
them
one
must
needs
present
an
exterior
of
some
show
and
that
we
have
now
lost
but
i
have
not
yet
abdicated
my
my
reason
he
added
as
if
he
were
talking
to
himself
monsieur
replied
godefroid
gravely
the
history
you
gave
me
yesterday
would
touch
even
a
no
no
for
barbet
that
publisher
the
proprietor
of
this
house
is
speculating
on
my
poverty
and
has
sent
the
vauthier
woman
his
former
cook
to
spy
upon
how
can
he
speculate
upon
you
asked
godefroid
i
will
tell
you
later
replied
the
old
man
my
daughter
is
cold
and
since
you
offer
it
i
am
reduced
to
accept
alms
were
it
even
from
my
worst
i
will
carry
in
some
wood
said
godefroid
gathering
up
ten
or
a
dozen
sticks
and
taking
them
into
monsieur
bernard
s
first
room
the
old
man
took
as
many
himself
and
when
he
saw
the
little
provision
safely
deposited
he
could
not
restrain
the
silly
and
even
idiotic
smile
with
which
those
who
are
saved
from
a
mortal
danger
which
has
seemed
to
them
inevitable
express
their
joy
for
terror
still
lingers
in
their
joy
accept
things
from
me
my
dear
monsieur
bernard
without
reluctance
and
when
your
daughter
is
safe
and
you
are
once
more
at
ease
we
will
settle
all
meantime
let
me
act
for
you
i
have
been
to
see
that
polish
doctor
unfortunately
he
is
absent
he
will
not
be
back
for
two
at
this
moment
a
voice
which
seemed
to
godefroid
to
have
and
really
had
a
fresh
melodious
ring
cried
out
papa
papa
on
two
expressive
notes
while
speaking
to
the
old
man
godefroid
had
noticed
that
the
jambs
of
a
door
leading
to
another
room
were
painted
in
a
delicate
manner
altogether
different
from
that
of
the
rest
of
the
lodging
his
curiosity
already
so
keenly
excited
was
now
roused
to
the
highest
pitch
he
was
conscious
that
his
mission
of
benevolence
was
becoming
nothing
more
than
a
pretext
what
he
really
wanted
was
to
see
that
sick
woman
he
refused
to
believe
for
an
instant
that
a
creature
endowed
with
such
a
voice
could
be
an
object
of
repulsion
you
do
indeed
take
too
much
trouble
papa
said
the
voice
why
not
have
more
servants
and
at
your
age
too
good
god
but
you
know
my
dear
vanda
that
the
boy
and
i
can
not
bear
that
any
one
should
wait
upon
you
but
ourselves
those
sentences
which
godefroid
heard
through
the
door
or
rather
divined
for
a
heavy
portiere
on
the
inside
smothered
the
sounds
gave
him
an
inkling
of
the
truth
the
sick
woman
surrounded
by
luxury
was
evidently
kept
in
ignorance
of
the
real
situation
of
her
father
and
son
the
violet
silk
of
monsieur
bernard
the
flowers
his
remarks
to
cartier
had
already
roused
some
suspicion
of
this
in
godefroid
s
mind
the
young
man
stood
still
where
he
was
bewildered
by
this
prodigy
of
paternal
love
the
contrast
such
as
he
imagined
it
between
the
invalid
s
room
and
the
rest
of
that
squalid
place
yes
it
was
bewildering
xiv
how
the
poor
and
helpless
are
preyed
upon
through
the
door
of
a
third
chamber
which
the
old
man
had
left
open
godefroid
beheld
two
cots
of
painted
wood
like
those
of
the
cheapest
each
with
a
straw
bed
and
a
thin
mattress
on
which
there
was
but
one
blanket
a
small
iron
stove
like
those
that
porters
cook
by
near
which
lay
a
few
squares
of
peat
would
alone
have
shown
the
poverty
of
the
household
without
the
help
of
other
details
advancing
a
step
or
two
godefroid
saw
utensils
such
as
the
poorest
persons
use
earthenware
jugs
and
pans
in
which
potatoes
floated
in
dirty
water
two
tables
of
blackened
wood
covered
with
books
and
papers
stood
before
the
windows
that
looked
out
upon
the
rue
des
champs
and
indicated
the
nocturnal
occupations
of
father
and
son
on
each
of
the
tables
was
a
flat
iron
candlestick
such
as
are
used
by
the
very
poor
and
in
them
godefroid
noticed
of
the
kind
that
are
sold
at
eight
to
the
pound
on
a
third
table
glittered
two
forks
and
spoons
and
another
little
spoon
of
together
with
plates
bowls
and
cups
of
sevres
china
and
a
knife
and
fork
in
an
open
case
all
evidently
for
the
service
of
the
sick
woman
the
stove
was
lighted
the
water
in
the
copper
was
steaming
slightly
a
painted
wooden
closet
or
wardrobe
contained
no
doubt
the
linen
and
clothing
of
monsieur
bernard
s
daughter
on
the
old
man
s
bed
godefroid
noticed
that
the
habiliments
he
had
worn
the
night
before
lay
spread
as
a
covering
the
floor
evidently
seldom
swept
looked
like
that
of
a
boy
s
a
loaf
of
bread
from
which
some
slices
had
been
cut
was
on
a
shelf
above
the
table
here
was
poverty
in
its
last
stages
poverty
resolutely
accepted
with
stern
endurance
making
shift
with
the
lowest
and
poorest
means
a
strong
and
sickening
odor
came
from
this
room
which
was
rarely
cleaned
the
antechamber
in
which
godefroid
stood
was
at
any
rate
decent
and
he
suspected
that
it
served
to
conceal
the
horrors
of
the
room
in
which
the
grandfather
and
the
grandson
lived
this
antechamber
hung
with
a
checked
paper
of
scotch
pattern
held
four
walnut
chairs
a
small
table
a
colored
engraving
of
the
emperor
after
horace
vernet
also
portraits
of
louis
charles
and
prince
poniatowski
no
doubt
the
friend
of
monsieur
bernard
s
the
window
was
draped
with
white
calico
curtains
edged
with
red
bands
and
fringe
godefroid
watched
for
nepomucene
and
when
the
latter
made
his
next
trip
with
wood
signed
to
him
to
stack
it
very
gently
in
monsieur
bernard
s
antechamber
then
a
perception
which
proved
some
progress
in
our
initiate
he
closed
the
door
of
the
inner
lair
that
madame
vauthier
s
slave
might
not
see
the
old
man
s
squalor
the
antechamber
was
just
then
encumbered
with
three
filled
with
plants
two
were
oblong
one
round
all
three
were
of
a
species
of
ebony
and
of
great
elegance
even
nepomucene
took
notice
of
them
and
said
as
he
deposited
the
wood
hey
ain
t
they
pretty
they
must
have
cost
a
good
bit
jean
don
t
make
so
much
noise
called
monsieur
bernard
from
his
daughter
s
room
did
you
hear
that
whispered
nepomucene
to
godefroid
he
s
cracked
for
sure
that
old
you
don
t
know
what
you
may
be
at
his
yes
i
do
know
responded
nepomucene
i
shall
be
in
the
the
yes
they
ll
have
made
my
bones
into
charcoal
by
that
time
i
often
see
the
carts
of
the
refineries
coming
to
montsouris
for
charcoal
they
tell
me
they
make
sugar
of
and
he
departed
after
another
load
of
wood
satisfied
with
this
philosophical
reflection
godefroid
discreetly
withdrew
to
his
own
rooms
closing
monsieur
bernard
s
door
behind
him
madame
vauthier
who
during
this
time
had
been
preparing
her
new
lodger
s
breakfast
now
came
up
to
serve
it
attended
by
felicite
godefroid
lost
in
reflection
stared
into
his
fire
he
was
absorbed
in
meditation
on
this
great
misery
which
contained
so
many
different
miseries
and
yet
within
which
he
could
see
the
ineffable
joys
of
the
many
triumphs
of
paternal
and
filial
love
they
were
gems
shining
in
the
blackness
of
the
pit
what
romances
even
those
that
are
most
famous
can
equal
such
realities
he
thought
what
a
life
it
will
be
to
relieve
the
burden
of
such
existences
to
seek
out
causes
and
effects
and
remedy
them
calming
sorrows
helping
good
to
incarnate
one
s
own
being
in
misery
to
familiarize
one
s
self
with
homes
like
that
to
act
out
constantly
in
life
those
dramas
which
move
us
so
in
fiction
i
never
imagined
that
good
could
be
more
interesting
more
piquant
than
is
monsieur
satisfied
with
his
breakfast
asked
madame
vauthier
who
now
with
felicite
s
assistance
brought
the
table
close
to
godefroid
godefroid
then
saw
a
cup
of
excellent
au
with
a
smoking
omelet
fresh
butter
and
little
red
radishes
where
the
devil
did
you
get
those
radishes
he
asked
they
were
given
me
by
monsieur
cartier
answered
madame
vauthier
and
i
make
a
present
of
them
to
and
what
are
you
going
to
ask
me
for
such
a
breakfast
daily
well
now
monsieur
be
fair
i
couldn
t
do
it
for
less
than
thirty
very
good
thirty
sous
then
said
godefroid
but
how
is
it
that
they
ask
me
only
francs
a
month
for
dinner
close
by
here
at
machillot
s
that
is
the
same
price
you
ask
me
for
but
what
a
difference
monsieur
between
preparing
a
dinner
for
fifteen
or
twenty
persons
and
going
out
to
get
you
just
what
you
want
for
breakfast
see
here
there
s
a
roll
eggs
butter
the
cost
of
lighting
a
fire
sugar
milk
coffee
just
think
they
ask
you
sixteen
sous
for
a
cup
of
coffee
alone
on
the
place
de
l
odeon
and
then
you
have
to
give
a
sou
or
two
to
the
waiter
here
you
have
no
trouble
you
can
breakfast
in
very
well
very
well
said
godefroid
without
madame
cartier
who
supplies
me
with
milk
and
eggs
and
herbs
i
couldn
t
manage
it
you
ought
to
go
and
see
their
establishment
monsieur
ha
it
s
fine
they
employ
five
journeymen
gardeners
and
nepomucene
goes
there
in
summer
to
draw
water
for
them
they
hire
him
of
me
as
a
waterer
they
make
lots
of
money
out
of
melons
and
strawberries
it
seems
monsieur
takes
quite
an
interest
in
monsieur
bernard
continued
the
widow
in
dulcet
tones
or
he
wouldn
t
be
responsible
for
his
debts
perhaps
he
doesn
t
know
all
that
family
owes
there
s
the
lady
who
keeps
the
circulating
library
on
the
place
she
is
always
coming
here
after
thirty
francs
they
owe
her
and
she
needs
it
god
knows
that
sick
woman
in
there
she
reads
reads
reads
two
sous
a
volume
makes
thirty
francs
in
three
that
means
a
hundred
volumes
a
month
said
godefroid
ah
there
s
the
old
man
going
now
to
fetch
a
roll
and
cream
for
his
daughter
s
tea
yes
tea
she
lives
on
tea
that
lady
she
drinks
it
twice
a
day
and
twice
a
week
she
has
to
have
sweet
things
oh
she
s
dainty
the
old
man
buys
cakes
and
pates
from
the
pastry
cook
in
the
rue
de
buci
he
don
t
care
what
he
spends
if
it
s
for
her
he
calls
her
his
daughter
it
ain
t
often
that
men
of
his
age
do
for
a
daughter
what
he
does
for
her
he
just
kills
himself
he
and
auguste
too
for
that
woman
monsieur
is
just
like
me
i
d
give
anything
to
see
her
monsieur
berton
says
she
s
a
monster
something
like
those
they
show
for
money
that
s
the
reason
they
ve
come
to
live
here
in
this
lonely
quarter
well
so
monsieur
thinks
of
dining
at
madame
machillot
s
does
he
yes
i
think
of
making
an
arrangement
monsieur
it
isn
t
that
i
want
to
interfere
but
i
must
say
comparing
food
with
food
you
d
do
much
better
to
dine
in
the
rue
de
tournon
you
needn
t
engage
by
the
month
and
you
ll
find
a
better
whereabouts
in
the
rue
de
tournon
at
the
successors
to
madame
giraud
that
s
where
the
gentlemen
upstairs
go
they
are
satisfied
and
more
than
well
i
ll
take
your
advice
and
dine
there
my
dear
monsieur
said
the
woman
emboldened
by
the
which
godefroid
intentionally
assumed
tell
me
seriously
you
are
not
going
to
be
such
a
muff
as
to
pay
monsieur
bernard
s
debts
it
would
really
trouble
me
if
you
did
for
just
reflect
my
kind
monsieur
godefroid
he
s
nearly
seventy
and
after
him
what
then
not
a
penny
of
pension
how
ll
you
get
paid
young
men
are
so
imprudent
do
you
know
that
he
owes
three
thousand
francs
to
whom
inquired
godefroid
oh
to
whom
that
s
not
my
affair
said
the
widow
mysteriously
it
is
enough
that
he
does
owe
them
between
ourselves
i
ll
tell
you
this
somebody
will
soon
be
down
on
him
for
that
money
and
he
can
t
get
a
penny
of
credit
now
in
the
quarter
just
on
that
three
thousand
francs
repeated
godefroid
oh
you
needn
t
be
afraid
i
ll
lend
him
that
if
i
had
three
thousand
francs
to
dispose
of
i
shouldn
t
be
your
lodger
but
i
can
t
bear
to
see
others
suffer
and
just
for
a
hundred
or
so
of
francs
i
sha
n
t
let
my
neighbor
a
man
with
white
hair
too
lack
for
bread
or
wood
why
one
often
loses
as
much
as
that
at
cards
but
three
thousand
francs
good
heavens
what
are
you
thinking
of
madame
vauthier
deceived
by
godefroid
s
apparent
frankness
let
a
smile
of
satisfaction
appear
on
her
specious
face
which
confirmed
all
her
lodger
s
suspicions
godefroid
was
convinced
that
the
old
woman
was
an
accomplice
in
some
plot
that
was
brewing
against
the
unfortunate
old
man
it
is
strange
monsieur
she
went
on
what
fancies
one
takes
into
one
s
head
you
ll
think
me
very
curious
but
yesterday
when
i
saw
you
talking
with
monsieur
bernard
i
said
to
myself
that
you
were
the
clerk
of
some
publisher
for
this
you
know
is
a
publisher
s
quarter
i
once
lodged
the
foreman
of
a
in
the
rue
de
vaugirard
and
his
name
was
the
same
as
yours
what
does
my
business
signify
to
you
interrupted
godefroid
oh
pooh
you
can
tell
me
or
you
needn
t
tell
me
i
shall
know
it
all
the
same
retorted
vauthier
there
s
monsieur
bernard
for
instance
for
eighteen
months
he
concealed
everything
from
me
but
on
the
nineteenth
i
discovered
that
he
had
been
a
magistrate
a
judge
somewhere
or
other
i
forget
where
and
was
writing
a
book
on
law
matters
what
did
he
gain
by
concealing
it
i
ask
you
if
he
had
told
me
i
d
have
said
nothing
about
it
so
there
i
am
not
yet
a
publisher
s
clerk
but
i
expect
to
be
said
godefroid
i
thought
so
exclaimed
madame
vauthier
turning
round
from
the
bed
she
had
been
making
as
a
pretext
for
staying
in
the
room
you
have
come
here
to
cut
the
ground
from
under
the
feet
of
good
man
is
a
man
stop
cried
godefroid
placing
himself
between
the
vauthier
and
the
door
look
here
what
interest
have
you
in
the
matter
gracious
said
the
old
woman
eyeing
godefroid
cautiously
you
re
a
bold
one
she
went
to
the
door
of
the
outer
room
and
bolted
it
then
she
came
back
and
sat
down
on
a
chair
beside
the
fire
on
my
word
of
honor
and
as
sure
as
my
name
is
vauthier
i
took
you
for
a
student
until
i
saw
you
giving
your
wood
to
that
old
bernard
ha
you
re
a
sly
one
and
what
a
i
was
so
certain
you
were
a
ninny
look
here
will
you
guarantee
me
a
thousand
francs
as
sure
as
the
sun
shines
my
old
barbet
and
monsieur
metivier
have
promised
me
five
hundred
to
keep
my
eyes
open
for
they
five
hundred
francs
nonsense
cried
godefroid
i
know
their
ways
two
hundred
is
the
very
most
my
good
woman
and
even
that
is
only
promised
you
can
t
assign
it
but
i
will
say
this
if
you
will
put
me
in
the
way
to
do
the
business
they
want
to
do
with
monsieur
bernard
i
will
pay
you
four
hundred
francs
now
then
how
does
the
matter
stand
they
have
advanced
fifteen
hundred
francs
upon
the
work
said
madame
vauthier
making
no
further
effort
at
deception
and
the
old
man
has
signed
an
acknowledgment
for
three
thousand
they
wouldn
t
do
it
under
a
hundred
per
cent
he
thought
he
could
easily
pay
them
out
of
his
book
but
they
have
arranged
to
get
the
better
of
him
there
it
was
they
who
sent
cartier
here
and
the
other
here
godefroid
gave
the
old
woman
a
glance
of
ironical
intelligence
which
showed
her
that
he
saw
through
the
role
she
was
playing
in
the
interest
of
her
proprietor
her
words
were
in
fact
a
double
illumination
to
godefroid
the
curious
scene
between
himself
and
the
gardener
was
now
explained
well
she
resumed
they
have
got
him
now
where
is
he
to
find
three
thousand
francs
they
intend
to
offer
him
five
hundred
the
day
he
puts
the
first
volume
of
his
book
into
their
hands
and
five
hundred
for
each
succeeding
volume
the
affair
isn
t
in
their
names
they
have
put
it
into
the
hands
of
a
publisher
whom
barbet
set
up
on
the
quai
des
what
that
little
fellow
yes
that
little
morand
who
was
formerly
barbet
s
clerk
it
seems
they
expect
a
good
bit
of
money
out
of
the
there
s
a
good
bit
to
spend
said
godefroid
with
a
significant
grimace
just
then
a
gentle
rap
was
heard
at
the
door
of
the
outer
room
godefroid
glad
of
the
interruption
having
got
all
he
wanted
to
know
out
of
madame
vauthier
went
to
open
it
what
is
said
is
said
madame
vauthier
he
remarked
as
he
did
so
the
visitor
was
monsieur
bernard
ah
monsieur
bernard
cried
the
widow
when
she
saw
him
i
ve
got
a
letter
downstairs
for
the
old
man
followed
her
down
a
few
steps
when
they
were
out
of
hearing
from
godefroid
s
room
she
stopped
no
she
said
i
haven
t
any
letter
i
only
wanted
to
tell
you
to
beware
of
that
young
man
he
belongs
to
a
publishing
that
explains
everything
thought
the
old
man
he
went
back
to
his
neighbor
with
a
very
different
expression
of
countenance
the
look
of
calm
coldness
with
which
monsieur
bernard
now
entered
the
room
contrasted
so
strongly
with
the
frank
and
cordial
air
he
had
worn
not
an
instant
earlier
that
godefroid
was
forcibly
struck
by
it
pardon
me
monsieur
said
the
old
man
stiffly
but
you
have
shown
me
many
favors
and
a
benefactor
creates
certain
rights
in
those
he
godefroid
bowed
i
who
for
the
last
five
years
have
endured
a
passion
like
that
of
our
lord
i
who
for
years
represented
social
welfare
government
public
vengeance
have
as
you
may
well
believe
no
illusions
no
i
have
nothing
left
but
anguish
well
monsieur
i
was
about
to
say
that
your
little
act
in
closing
the
door
of
my
wretched
lair
that
simple
little
thing
was
to
me
the
glass
of
water
bossuet
tells
of
yes
i
did
find
in
my
heart
that
exhausted
heart
which
can
not
weep
just
as
my
withered
body
can
not
sweat
i
did
find
a
last
drop
of
the
elixir
which
makes
us
fancy
in
our
youth
that
all
human
beings
are
noble
and
i
came
to
offer
you
my
hand
i
came
to
bring
you
that
celestial
flower
of
belief
in
good
monsieur
bernard
said
godefroid
remembering
the
kind
old
alain
s
lessons
i
have
done
nothing
to
obtain
your
gratitude
you
are
quite
ah
that
is
frankness
indeed
said
the
former
magistrate
well
it
pleases
me
i
was
about
to
reproach
you
pardon
me
i
now
esteem
you
so
you
are
a
publisher
and
you
have
come
here
to
get
my
work
away
from
barbet
metivier
and
morand
all
is
now
explained
you
are
making
me
advances
in
money
as
they
did
only
you
do
it
with
some
did
madame
vauthier
just
tell
you
that
i
was
employed
by
a
publisher
asked
godefroid
well
then
monsieur
bernard
before
i
can
say
how
much
i
can
over
what
those
other
gentlemen
i
must
know
the
terms
on
which
you
stand
with
that
is
fair
said
monsieur
bernard
who
seemed
rather
pleased
to
find
himself
the
object
of
a
competition
by
which
he
might
profit
do
you
know
what
my
work
is
no
i
only
know
it
is
a
good
enterprise
from
a
business
point
of
it
is
only
nine
my
daughter
has
breakfasted
and
cartier
will
not
bring
the
flowers
for
an
hour
or
more
we
have
time
to
talk
monsieur
monsieur
who
monsieur
godefroid
the
work
in
question
was
projected
by
me
in
at
the
time
when
the
ministry
being
alarmed
by
the
persistent
destruction
of
landed
estates
proposed
that
law
of
primogeniture
which
was
you
will
remember
defeated
i
had
remarked
certain
imperfections
in
our
codes
and
in
the
fundamental
institutions
of
france
our
codes
have
often
been
the
subject
of
important
works
but
those
works
were
all
from
the
point
of
view
of
jurisprudence
no
one
had
even
ventured
to
consider
the
work
of
the
revolution
or
if
you
prefer
it
of
napoleon
as
a
whole
no
one
had
studied
the
spirit
of
those
laws
and
judged
them
in
their
application
that
is
the
main
purpose
of
my
work
it
is
entitled
provisionally
the
spirit
of
the
new
laws
it
includes
organic
laws
as
well
as
codes
all
codes
for
we
have
many
more
than
five
codes
consequently
my
work
is
in
several
volumes
six
in
all
the
last
being
a
volume
of
citations
notes
and
references
it
will
take
me
now
about
three
months
to
finish
it
the
proprietor
of
this
house
a
former
publisher
of
whom
i
made
a
few
inquiries
perceived
scented
i
may
say
the
chance
of
a
speculation
i
in
the
first
instance
thought
only
of
doing
a
service
to
my
country
and
not
of
my
own
profit
well
this
barbet
has
circumvented
me
you
will
ask
me
how
it
was
possible
for
a
publisher
to
get
the
better
of
a
magistrate
a
man
who
knows
the
laws
well
it
was
in
this
way
you
know
my
history
barbet
is
an
usurer
he
has
the
keen
glance
and
the
shrewd
action
of
that
breed
of
men
his
money
was
always
at
my
heels
to
help
me
over
my
worst
needs
strange
to
say
on
the
days
i
was
most
defenceless
against
despair
he
happened
to
no
no
my
dear
monsieur
bernard
said
godefroid
he
had
a
spy
in
madame
vauthier
she
told
him
when
you
needed
money
but
the
terms
the
conditions
tell
them
to
me
he
has
lent
me
from
time
to
time
fifteen
hundred
francs
for
which
i
have
signed
three
notes
of
a
thousand
francs
each
and
those
notes
are
secured
by
a
sort
of
mortgage
on
the
copyright
of
my
book
so
that
i
can
not
sell
my
book
unless
i
pay
off
those
notes
and
the
notes
are
now
protested
he
has
taken
the
matter
into
court
and
obtained
a
judgment
against
me
such
are
the
complications
of
poverty
at
the
lowest
valuation
the
first
edition
of
my
great
work
a
work
representing
ten
years
toil
and
years
experience
is
fully
worth
ten
thousand
francs
well
ten
days
ago
morand
proposed
to
give
me
three
thousand
francs
and
my
notes
cancelled
for
the
entire
rights
in
perpetuity
now
as
it
is
not
possible
for
me
to
refund
the
amount
of
my
notes
and
interest
namely
three
thousand
two
hundred
and
forty
francs
i
must
unless
you
intend
to
step
between
those
usurers
and
me
i
must
yield
to
them
they
are
not
content
with
my
word
of
honor
they
first
obtained
the
notes
then
they
had
them
protested
and
now
i
am
threatened
with
arrest
for
debt
if
i
could
manage
to
pay
them
back
those
scoundrels
would
have
doubled
their
money
if
i
accept
their
terms
they
will
make
a
fortune
out
of
my
book
and
i
shall
get
almost
nothing
one
of
them
is
a
and
god
knows
how
they
may
keep
down
the
costs
of
publication
they
will
have
my
name
and
that
alone
will
sell
ten
thousand
copies
for
but
monsieur
how
could
you
a
former
magistrate
how
could
i
help
it
not
a
friend
not
a
claim
that
i
could
make
and
yet
i
saved
many
heads
if
i
made
some
fall
and
then
my
daughter
my
daughter
whose
nurse
i
am
whose
companion
i
must
be
so
that
i
can
work
but
a
few
hours
snatched
from
sleep
ah
young
man
none
but
the
wretched
can
judge
the
wretched
sometimes
i
think
i
used
to
be
too
stern
to
monsieur
i
do
not
ask
your
name
i
can
not
provide
three
thousand
francs
especially
if
i
pay
halpersohn
and
your
lesser
debts
but
i
will
save
you
if
you
will
promise
me
not
to
part
with
your
book
without
letting
me
know
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
arrange
a
matter
as
important
as
this
without
consulting
others
my
backers
are
powerful
and
i
can
promise
you
success
if
you
in
return
will
promise
me
absolute
secrecy
even
to
your
children
and
keep
your
the
only
success
i
care
for
is
the
recovery
of
my
poor
vanda
for
such
sufferings
as
hers
extinguish
every
other
feeling
in
a
father
s
heart
as
for
fame
what
is
that
to
one
who
sees
an
open
grave
before
him
i
will
come
and
see
you
this
evening
they
expect
halpersohn
at
any
time
and
i
shall
go
there
day
after
day
until
i
find
ah
monsieur
if
you
should
be
the
cause
of
my
daughter
s
recovery
i
would
like
yes
i
would
like
to
give
you
my
work
monsieur
said
godefroid
i
am
not
a
the
old
man
started
with
surprise
i
let
that
old
vauthier
think
so
in
order
to
discover
the
traps
they
were
laying
for
then
who
are
you
godefroid
replied
the
initiate
and
since
you
allow
me
to
offer
you
enough
to
make
the
pot
boil
you
can
call
me
if
you
like
godefroid
de
the
old
man
was
far
too
moved
to
laugh
at
a
joke
he
held
out
his
hand
to
godefroid
and
pressed
that
which
the
young
man
gave
him
in
return
you
wish
to
keep
your
incognito
he
said
looking
at
godefroid
sadly
with
some
uneasiness
if
you
will
allow
well
as
you
will
come
and
you
shall
see
my
daughter
if
her
condition
this
was
evidently
a
great
concession
in
the
eyes
of
the
poor
father
and
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
by
the
look
on
godefroid
s
face
that
it
was
understood
an
hour
later
cartier
returned
with
a
number
of
beautiful
flowering
plants
which
he
placed
himself
in
the
jardinieres
covering
them
with
fresh
moss
godefroid
paid
his
bill
also
that
of
the
circulating
library
which
was
brought
soon
after
books
and
flowers
these
were
the
daily
bread
of
this
poor
invalid
this
tortured
creature
who
was
satisfied
with
so
little
as
he
thought
of
this
family
coiled
by
misfortunes
like
that
of
the
laocoon
sublime
image
of
so
many
lives
godefroid
who
was
now
on
his
way
on
foot
to
the
rue
marbeuf
was
conscious
in
his
heart
of
more
curiosity
than
benevolence
this
sick
woman
surrounded
by
luxury
in
the
midst
of
such
direful
poverty
made
him
forget
the
horrible
details
of
the
strangest
of
all
nervous
disorders
which
is
happily
rare
though
recorded
by
a
few
historians
one
of
our
most
gossiping
chroniclers
tallemant
des
reaux
cites
an
instance
of
it
the
mind
instinctively
pictures
a
woman
as
being
elegant
in
the
midst
of
her
worst
sufferings
and
godefroid
let
himself
dwell
on
the
pleasure
of
entering
that
chamber
where
none
but
the
father
son
and
doctor
had
been
admitted
for
six
years
nevertheless
he
ended
by
blaming
himself
for
his
curiosity
he
even
felt
that
the
sentiment
natural
as
it
was
would
cease
as
he
went
on
exercising
his
beneficent
ministry
from
the
mere
fact
of
seeing
more
distressed
homes
and
many
sorrows
such
agents
do
reach
in
time
a
divine
serenity
which
nothing
surprises
or
confounds
just
as
in
love
we
come
to
the
divine
quietude
of
that
emotion
sure
of
its
strength
sure
of
its
lastingness
through
our
constant
experience
of
its
pains
and
sweetnesses
godefroid
was
told
that
halpersohn
had
returned
during
the
night
but
had
been
obliged
to
go
out
at
once
to
visit
patients
who
were
awaiting
him
the
porter
told
godefroid
to
come
the
next
day
before
nine
o
clock
in
the
morning
remembering
monsieur
alain
s
injunction
to
parsimony
in
his
personal
expenses
godefroid
dined
for
sous
in
the
rue
de
tournon
and
was
rewarded
for
his
abnegation
by
finding
himself
in
the
midst
of
compositors
and
pressmen
he
heard
a
discussion
on
costs
of
manufacturing
and
learned
that
an
edition
of
one
thousand
copies
of
an
octavo
volume
of
forty
sheets
did
not
cost
more
than
thirty
sous
a
copy
in
the
best
style
of
printing
he
resolved
to
ascertain
the
price
at
which
publishers
of
law
books
sold
their
volumes
so
as
to
be
prepared
for
a
discussion
with
the
men
who
held
monsieur
bernard
in
their
clutches
if
he
should
have
to
meet
them
towards
seven
in
the
evening
he
returned
to
the
boulevard
du
by
way
of
the
rue
de
vaugiraud
and
the
rue
de
l
ouest
and
he
saw
then
how
deserted
the
quarter
was
for
he
met
no
one
it
is
true
that
the
cold
was
rigorous
and
the
snow
fell
in
great
flakes
the
wheels
of
the
carriages
making
no
noise
upon
the
pavements
ah
here
you
are
monsieur
said
madame
vauthier
if
i
had
known
you
were
coming
home
so
early
i
would
have
made
your
i
don
t
want
one
said
godefroid
seeing
that
the
widow
followed
him
i
shall
spend
the
evening
in
monsieur
bernard
s
well
well
you
must
be
his
cousin
if
you
are
hand
and
glove
like
that
perhaps
monsieur
will
finish
now
the
little
conversation
we
ah
yes
about
that
four
hundred
francs
look
here
my
good
madame
vauthier
you
are
trying
to
see
which
way
the
cat
jumps
and
you
ll
tumble
yourself
between
two
stools
as
for
me
you
have
betrayed
me
and
made
me
miss
the
whole
now
don
t
think
that
my
dear
monsieur
while
you
breakfast
i
shall
not
breakfast
here
i
am
going
out
like
your
authors
at
godefroid
s
antecedents
his
life
as
a
man
of
the
world
and
a
journalist
served
him
in
this
that
he
felt
quite
sure
unless
he
took
this
tone
that
barbet
s
spy
would
warn
the
old
publisher
of
danger
and
probably
lead
to
active
measures
under
which
monsieur
bernard
would
before
long
be
arrested
whereas
if
he
left
the
trio
of
harpies
to
suppose
that
their
scheme
ran
no
risk
of
defeat
they
would
keep
quiet
but
godefroid
did
not
yet
know
parisian
human
nature
when
embodied
in
a
vauthier
that
woman
resolved
to
have
godefroid
s
money
and
barbet
s
too
she
instantly
ran
off
to
her
proprietor
while
godefroid
changed
his
clothes
in
order
to
present
himself
properly
before
the
daughter
of
monsieur
bernard
xv
an
evening
with
vanda
eight
o
clock
was
striking
from
the
convent
of
the
visitation
the
clock
of
the
quarter
when
the
inquisitive
godefroid
tapped
gently
at
his
neighbor
s
door
auguste
opened
it
as
it
happened
to
be
a
saturday
the
young
lad
had
his
evening
to
himself
godefroid
beheld
him
in
a
little
of
black
velvet
a
blue
silk
cravat
and
black
trousers
but
his
surprise
at
the
youth
s
appearance
so
different
from
that
of
this
outside
life
ceased
as
soon
as
he
had
entered
the
invalid
s
chamber
he
then
understood
the
reason
why
both
father
and
son
were
well
dressed
for
a
moment
the
contrast
between
the
squalor
of
the
other
rooms
as
he
had
seen
them
that
morning
and
the
luxury
of
this
chamber
was
so
great
that
godefroid
was
dazzled
though
habituated
for
years
to
the
luxury
and
elegance
procured
by
wealth
the
walls
of
the
room
were
hung
with
yellow
silk
relieved
by
twisted
fringes
of
a
bright
green
giving
a
gay
and
cheerful
aspect
to
the
chamber
the
cold
tiled
floor
of
which
was
hidden
by
a
moquette
carpet
with
a
white
ground
strewn
with
flowers
the
windows
draped
by
handsome
curtains
lined
with
white
silk
were
like
conservatories
so
full
were
they
of
plants
in
flower
the
blinds
were
lowered
which
prevented
this
luxury
so
rare
in
that
quarter
of
the
town
from
being
seen
from
the
street
the
woodwork
was
painted
in
white
enamel
touched
up
here
and
there
by
a
few
gold
lines
at
the
door
was
a
heavy
portiere
embroidered
by
hand
with
fantastic
foliage
on
a
yellow
ground
so
thick
that
all
sounds
from
without
were
stifled
this
magnificent
curtain
was
made
by
the
sick
woman
herself
who
could
work
when
she
had
the
use
of
her
hands
like
a
fairy
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
and
opposite
to
the
door
was
the
fireplace
with
a
green
velvet
on
which
a
few
extremely
elegant
ornaments
the
last
relics
of
the
opulence
of
two
families
were
arranged
these
consisted
of
a
curious
clock
in
the
shape
of
an
elephant
supporting
on
its
back
a
porcelain
tower
which
was
filled
with
the
choicest
flowers
two
candelabra
in
the
same
style
and
several
precious
chinese
treasures
the
fender
andirons
tongs
and
shovel
were
all
of
the
handsomest
description
the
largest
of
the
was
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
above
it
hung
a
porcelain
chandelier
designed
with
wreaths
of
flowers
the
bed
on
which
the
old
man
s
daughter
lay
was
one
of
those
beautiful
white
and
gold
carved
bedsteads
such
as
were
made
in
the
louis
xv
period
by
the
sick
woman
s
pillow
was
a
very
pretty
marquetry
table
on
which
were
the
various
articles
necessary
to
this
bedridden
life
against
the
wall
was
a
bracket
lamp
with
two
branches
either
of
which
could
be
moved
forward
or
back
by
a
mere
touch
of
the
hand
a
small
table
adapted
to
the
use
of
the
invalid
extended
in
front
of
her
the
bed
covered
with
a
beautiful
counterpane
and
draped
with
curtains
held
back
by
cords
was
heaped
with
books
a
and
articles
of
embroidery
beneath
which
godefroid
would
scarcely
have
distinguished
the
sick
woman
herself
had
it
not
been
for
the
light
of
the
bracket
lamps
there
was
nothing
of
her
to
be
seen
but
a
face
of
extreme
whiteness
browned
around
the
eyes
by
suffering
in
which
shone
eyes
of
fire
its
principal
adornment
being
a
magnificent
mass
of
black
hair
the
numerous
heavy
curls
of
which
carefully
arranged
showed
that
the
dressing
of
those
beautiful
locks
occupied
a
good
part
of
the
invalid
s
morning
this
supposition
was
further
strengthened
by
the
portable
mirror
which
lay
on
the
bed
no
modern
arrangement
for
comfort
was
lacking
even
a
few
which
amused
poor
vanda
proved
that
the
father
s
love
was
almost
fanatical
the
old
man
rose
from
an
elegant
louis
xv
sofa
in
white
and
cold
covered
with
tapestry
and
advanced
to
godefroid
who
would
certainly
not
have
recognized
him
elsewhere
for
that
cold
stern
face
now
wore
the
gay
expression
peculiar
to
old
men
of
the
world
who
retain
the
manners
and
apparent
frivolity
of
the
nobility
about
a
court
his
wadded
violet
gown
was
in
keeping
with
this
luxury
and
he
took
snuff
from
a
gold
box
studded
with
diamonds
here
my
dear
daughter
said
monsieur
bernard
taking
godefroid
by
the
hand
is
the
neighbor
of
whom
i
told
he
signed
to
his
grandson
to
draw
up
one
of
two
armchairs
similar
in
style
to
the
sofa
which
stood
beside
the
fireplace
monsieur
s
name
is
godefroid
and
he
is
full
of
friendly
kindness
for
vanda
made
a
motion
with
her
head
in
answer
to
godefroid
s
low
bow
by
the
very
way
in
which
her
neck
bent
and
then
recovered
itself
godefroid
saw
that
the
whole
physical
life
of
the
invalid
was
in
her
head
the
thin
arms
and
flaccid
hands
lay
on
the
fine
white
linen
of
the
sheets
like
things
not
connected
with
the
body
which
indeed
seemed
to
fill
no
place
at
all
in
the
bed
the
articles
necessary
for
a
sick
person
were
on
shelves
standing
behind
the
bedstead
and
were
concealed
by
a
drawn
curtain
you
are
the
first
person
monsieur
except
my
doctors
who
are
not
men
to
me
whom
i
have
seen
for
six
years
therefore
you
can
not
doubt
the
interest
you
have
excited
in
my
mind
since
my
father
told
me
this
morning
that
you
were
to
pay
me
a
visit
interest
no
it
was
an
unconquerable
curiosity
like
that
of
our
mother
eve
my
father
who
is
so
good
to
me
and
my
son
whom
i
love
so
much
do
certainly
suffice
to
fill
the
desert
of
a
soul
which
is
almost
without
a
body
but
after
all
that
soul
is
still
a
woman
s
i
feel
it
in
the
childish
joy
the
thought
of
your
visit
has
brought
me
you
will
do
me
the
pleasure
to
take
a
cup
of
tea
with
us
i
hope
monsieur
has
promised
to
pass
the
evening
here
said
the
old
man
with
the
air
of
a
millionnaire
receiving
a
guest
auguste
sitting
on
a
tapestried
chair
at
a
marquetry
table
with
brass
trimmings
was
reading
a
book
by
the
light
of
the
candelabra
on
the
chimney
piece
auguste
my
dear
said
his
mother
tell
jean
to
serve
tea
in
an
hour
would
you
believe
it
monsieur
she
added
that
for
six
years
i
have
been
waited
upon
wholly
by
my
father
and
son
and
now
i
really
think
i
could
bear
no
other
attendance
if
they
were
to
fail
me
i
should
die
my
father
will
not
even
allow
jean
a
poor
norman
who
has
served
us
for
thirty
years
to
come
into
my
i
should
think
not
said
the
old
man
quickly
monsieur
knows
him
he
chops
wood
and
brings
it
in
and
cooks
he
wears
dirty
aprons
and
would
soon
spoil
all
this
elegance
in
which
you
take
such
pleasure
this
room
is
really
the
whole
of
life
to
my
poor
daughter
ah
madame
your
father
is
quite
but
why
she
said
if
jean
did
any
damage
to
my
room
my
father
would
restore
yes
my
child
but
remember
you
could
not
leave
it
you
don
t
know
what
parisian
tradesmen
are
they
would
take
three
months
to
renovate
your
room
let
jean
take
care
of
it
no
indeed
how
can
you
think
of
it
auguste
and
i
take
such
precautions
that
we
allow
no
dust
and
so
avoid
all
it
is
a
matter
of
health
not
economy
said
godefroid
your
father
is
i
am
not
complaining
said
vanda
in
a
caressing
voice
that
voice
was
a
concert
of
delightful
sounds
soul
motion
life
itself
were
concentrated
in
the
glance
and
in
the
voice
of
this
woman
for
vanda
had
succeeded
by
study
for
which
time
was
certainly
not
lacking
to
her
in
conquering
the
difficulty
produced
by
the
loss
of
her
teeth
i
have
much
to
make
me
happy
in
the
midst
of
my
sufferings
monsieur
she
said
and
certainly
ample
means
are
a
great
help
in
bearing
trouble
if
we
had
been
poor
i
should
have
died
eighteen
years
ago
but
i
still
live
oh
yes
i
have
many
enjoyments
and
they
are
all
the
greater
because
they
are
perpetually
won
from
death
i
am
afraid
you
will
think
me
quite
garrulous
she
added
smiling
madame
i
should
like
to
listen
to
you
forever
replied
godefroid
i
have
never
heard
a
voice
that
was
comparable
to
yours
it
is
music
rubini
is
not
more
don
t
speak
of
rubini
or
the
opera
said
the
old
man
sadly
that
is
a
pleasure
that
rich
as
i
am
i
can
not
give
to
my
daughter
she
was
once
a
great
musician
and
the
opera
was
her
greatest
forgive
me
said
godefroid
you
will
soon
get
accustomed
to
us
said
the
old
man
yes
and
this
is
the
process
said
the
sick
woman
laughing
when
they
ve
cried
puss
puss
puss
often
enough
you
ll
learn
the
of
our
godefroid
gave
a
rapid
glance
at
monsieur
bernard
who
seeing
the
tears
in
the
eyes
of
his
new
neighbor
seemed
to
be
making
him
a
sign
not
to
undo
the
results
of
the
he
and
his
grandson
had
practised
for
so
many
years
this
sublime
and
perpetual
imposture
proved
by
the
complete
illusion
of
the
sick
woman
produced
on
godefroid
s
mind
the
impression
of
an
alpine
precipice
down
which
two
chamois
hunters
picked
their
way
the
magnificent
gold
enriched
with
diamonds
with
which
the
old
man
carelessly
toyed
as
he
sat
by
his
daughter
s
bedside
was
like
the
stroke
of
genius
which
in
the
work
of
a
great
man
elicits
a
cry
of
admiration
godefroid
looked
at
that
wondering
it
had
not
been
sold
or
found
its
way
to
the
this
evening
monsieur
godefroid
my
daughter
received
the
announcement
of
your
visit
with
such
excitement
that
all
the
curious
symptoms
of
her
malady
which
have
troubled
us
very
much
for
the
last
twelve
days
have
entirely
disappeared
you
can
fancy
how
grateful
i
am
to
and
i
too
said
the
invalid
in
her
caressing
tones
drooping
her
head
with
a
motion
full
of
coquetry
monsieur
is
to
me
a
deputy
from
the
world
since
i
was
twenty
years
old
monsieur
i
have
not
seen
a
salon
or
a
party
or
a
ball
and
i
must
tell
you
that
i
love
dancing
and
adore
the
theatre
especially
the
opera
i
imagine
everything
by
thought
i
read
a
great
deal
and
then
my
father
who
goes
into
society
tells
me
about
social
godefroid
made
an
involuntary
movement
as
if
to
kneel
at
the
old
man
s
feet
yes
when
he
goes
to
the
opera
and
he
often
goes
he
describes
to
me
the
singing
and
tells
me
about
the
dresses
of
the
ladies
oh
i
would
i
were
cured
for
the
sake
of
my
father
who
lives
solely
for
me
as
i
live
by
him
and
for
him
and
then
for
my
son
to
whom
i
would
fain
be
a
real
mother
ah
monsieur
what
blessed
beings
my
old
father
and
my
good
son
are
i
should
also
like
to
recover
so
as
to
hear
lablache
rubini
tamburini
grisi
and
i
but
come
come
my
child
be
calm
if
we
talk
music
we
are
lost
said
the
old
man
smiling
that
smile
which
rejuvenated
his
face
was
evidently
a
perpetual
deception
to
the
sick
woman
yes
yes
i
ll
be
good
said
vanda
with
a
petulant
little
air
but
when
will
you
give
me
an
accordion
the
portable
instrument
then
called
by
that
name
had
just
been
invented
it
could
if
desired
be
placed
at
the
edge
of
a
bedstead
and
only
needed
the
pressure
of
a
foot
to
give
out
the
sounds
of
an
organ
this
instrument
in
its
highest
development
was
equal
to
a
piano
but
the
cost
of
it
was
three
hundred
francs
vanda
who
read
the
newspapers
and
reviews
knew
of
the
existence
of
the
instrument
and
had
wished
for
one
for
the
last
two
months
yes
madame
you
shall
have
one
said
godefroid
after
exchanging
a
look
with
the
old
man
a
friend
of
mine
who
is
just
starting
for
algiers
has
a
fine
instrument
and
i
will
borrow
it
of
him
before
buying
you
had
better
try
one
it
is
possible
that
the
powerful
vibrating
tones
may
be
too
much
for
can
i
have
it
she
said
with
the
wilfulness
of
a
creole
said
monsieur
bernard
that
is
soon
besides
is
ah
she
exclaimed
looking
at
godefroid
who
fancied
he
could
see
a
soul
hovering
in
the
air
as
he
admired
the
ubiquity
of
vanda
s
glances
until
then
godefroid
had
never
known
the
power
of
voice
and
eyes
when
the
whole
of
life
is
put
into
them
the
glance
was
no
longer
a
glance
a
look
it
was
a
flame
or
rather
a
divine
incandescence
a
radiance
communicating
life
and
mind
it
was
thought
made
visible
the
voice
with
its
thousand
intonations
took
the
place
of
motions
gestures
attitudes
the
variations
of
the
complexion
changing
color
like
the
famous
chameleon
made
the
illusion
perhaps
we
should
say
the
mirage
complete
that
suffering
head
lying
on
the
white
pillow
edged
with
laces
was
a
whole
person
in
itself
never
in
his
life
had
godefroid
seen
so
wonderful
a
sight
he
could
scarcely
control
his
emotions
another
wonder
for
all
was
wondrous
in
this
scene
so
full
of
horror
and
yet
of
poesy
was
that
in
those
who
saw
it
soul
alone
existed
this
atmosphere
filled
with
mental
emotions
only
had
a
celestial
influence
those
present
felt
their
bodies
as
little
as
the
sick
woman
felt
hers
they
were
all
mind
as
godefroid
contemplated
that
frail
fragment
of
woman
he
forgot
the
surrounding
elegancies
of
the
room
and
fancied
himself
beneath
the
open
heavens
it
was
not
until
half
an
hour
had
passed
that
he
came
back
to
his
sense
of
things
about
him
he
then
noticed
a
fine
picture
which
the
invalid
asked
him
to
examine
saying
it
was
by
gericault
gericault
she
told
him
came
from
rouen
his
family
were
under
certain
obligations
to
my
father
who
was
president
of
the
court
and
he
showed
his
gratitude
by
painting
that
portrait
of
me
when
i
was
a
girl
of
it
is
a
beautiful
picture
said
godefroid
and
quite
unknown
to
those
who
are
in
search
of
the
rare
works
of
that
to
me
it
is
merely
an
object
of
affection
replied
vanda
i
live
in
my
heart
only
and
it
is
a
beautiful
life
she
added
casting
a
look
at
her
father
in
which
she
seemed
to
put
her
very
soul
ah
monsieur
if
you
only
knew
what
my
father
really
is
who
would
believe
that
the
stern
and
lofty
magistrate
to
whom
the
emperor
was
under
such
obligations
that
he
gave
him
that
and
on
whom
charles
bestowed
as
a
reward
that
sevres
which
you
see
behind
you
who
would
suppose
that
that
rigid
supporter
of
power
and
law
that
learned
jurist
should
have
within
his
heart
of
rock
the
heart
of
a
mother
too
oh
papa
papa
kiss
me
kiss
me
come
the
old
man
rose
leaned
over
the
bed
and
kissed
the
broad
poetic
forehead
of
his
daughter
whose
passionate
excitements
did
not
always
take
the
turn
of
this
tempest
of
affection
then
he
walked
about
the
room
his
slippers
embroidered
by
his
daughter
making
no
noise
what
are
your
occupations
said
vanda
to
godefroid
after
a
pause
madame
i
am
employed
by
pious
persons
to
help
the
ah
what
a
noble
mission
monsieur
she
said
do
you
know
the
thought
of
devoting
myself
to
that
very
work
has
often
come
to
me
but
ah
what
ideas
do
not
come
to
me
she
added
with
a
motion
of
her
head
suffering
is
like
a
torch
which
lights
up
life
if
i
were
ever
to
recover
health
you
should
amuse
yourself
my
child
said
her
father
oh
yes
she
said
i
have
the
desire
but
should
i
then
have
the
faculty
my
son
will
be
i
hope
a
magistrate
worthy
of
his
two
grandfathers
and
he
will
leave
me
what
should
i
do
then
if
god
restores
me
to
life
i
will
dedicate
that
life
to
him
oh
after
giving
you
all
you
need
of
it
she
cried
looking
tenderly
at
her
father
and
son
there
are
moments
my
dear
father
when
the
ideas
of
monsieur
de
maistre
work
within
me
powerfully
and
i
fancy
that
i
am
expiating
see
what
it
is
to
read
too
much
said
the
old
man
evidently
troubled
that
brave
polish
general
my
great
grandfather
took
part
though
very
innocently
in
the
partition
of
well
well
now
it
is
poland
said
monsieur
bernard
how
can
i
help
it
papa
my
sufferings
are
infernal
they
give
me
a
horror
of
life
they
disgust
me
with
myself
well
i
ask
you
have
i
done
anything
to
deserve
them
such
diseases
are
not
a
mere
derangement
of
health
they
are
caused
by
a
perverted
organization
and
sing
that
national
air
your
poor
mother
used
to
sing
monsieur
godefroid
wants
to
hear
it
i
have
told
him
about
your
voice
said
the
old
man
endeavoring
to
distract
her
mind
from
the
current
of
such
thoughts
vanda
began
in
a
low
and
tender
voice
to
sing
a
polish
song
which
held
godefroid
dumb
with
admiration
and
also
with
sadness
this
melody
which
greatly
resembles
the
long
drawn
out
melancholy
airs
of
brittany
is
one
of
those
poems
which
vibrate
in
the
heart
long
after
the
ear
has
heard
them
as
he
listened
godefroid
looked
at
vanda
but
he
could
not
endure
the
ecstatic
glance
of
that
fragment
of
a
woman
partially
insane
and
his
eyes
wandered
to
two
cords
which
hung
one
on
each
side
of
the
canopy
of
the
bed
ah
ha
laughed
vanda
noticing
his
look
do
you
want
to
know
what
those
cords
are
for
vanda
said
her
father
hastily
calm
yourself
my
daughter
see
here
comes
tea
that
monsieur
he
continued
turning
to
godefroid
is
rather
a
costly
affair
my
daughter
can
not
rise
and
therefore
it
is
difficult
to
change
her
sheets
those
cords
are
fastened
to
pulleys
by
slipping
a
square
of
leather
beneath
her
and
drawing
it
up
by
the
four
corners
with
these
pulleys
we
are
able
to
make
her
bed
without
fatigue
to
her
or
to
they
swing
me
cried
vanda
gaily
happily
auguste
now
came
in
with
a
teapot
which
he
placed
on
a
table
together
with
the
sevres
then
he
brought
cakes
and
sandwiches
and
cream
this
sight
diverted
his
mother
s
mind
from
the
nervous
crisis
which
seemed
to
threaten
her
see
vanda
here
is
nathan
s
new
novel
if
you
wake
in
the
night
you
will
have
something
to
oh
delightful
la
perle
de
dol
it
must
be
a
auguste
i
have
something
to
tell
you
i
m
to
have
an
accordion
auguste
looked
up
suddenly
with
a
strange
glance
at
his
grandfather
see
how
he
loves
his
mother
cried
vanda
come
and
kiss
me
my
kitten
no
it
is
not
your
grandfather
you
are
to
thank
but
monsieur
who
is
good
enough
to
lend
me
one
i
am
to
have
it
how
are
they
made
monsieur
godefroid
at
a
sign
from
the
old
man
explained
an
accordion
at
length
while
sipping
the
tea
which
auguste
brought
him
and
which
was
in
truth
exquisite
about
ten
o
clock
he
retired
weary
of
beholding
the
desperate
struggle
of
the
son
and
father
admiring
their
heroism
and
the
daily
hourly
patience
with
which
they
played
their
double
parts
each
equally
exhausting
well
said
monsieur
bernard
who
followed
him
home
you
now
see
monsieur
the
life
i
live
i
am
like
a
thief
on
the
watch
all
the
time
a
word
a
gesture
might
kill
my
daughter
a
mere
gewgaw
less
than
she
is
accustomed
to
seeing
about
her
would
reveal
all
to
that
mind
that
can
penetrate
monsieur
replied
godefroid
on
monday
next
halpersohn
shall
pronounce
upon
your
daughter
he
has
returned
i
myself
doubt
the
possibility
of
any
science
being
able
to
revive
that
oh
i
don
t
expect
that
cried
the
father
all
i
ask
is
that
her
life
be
made
supportable
i
felt
sure
monsieur
of
your
sympathy
and
i
see
that
you
have
indeed
comprehended
everything
ah
there
s
the
attack
coming
on
he
exclaimed
as
the
sound
of
a
cry
came
through
the
partition
she
went
beyond
her
pressing
godefroid
s
hand
the
old
man
hurriedly
returned
to
his
own
rooms
at
eight
o
clock
the
next
morning
godefroid
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
celebrated
polish
doctor
he
was
shown
by
a
footman
to
the
first
floor
of
a
little
house
godefroid
had
been
examining
while
the
porter
was
seeking
and
informing
the
footman
happily
godefroid
s
early
arrival
saved
him
the
annoyance
of
being
kept
waiting
he
was
he
supposed
the
first
comer
from
a
very
plain
and
simple
antechamber
he
passed
into
a
large
study
where
he
saw
an
old
man
in
a
smoking
a
long
pipe
the
of
black
bombazine
shiny
with
use
dated
from
the
period
of
the
polish
emigration
what
can
i
do
for
you
said
the
jewish
doctor
for
i
see
you
are
not
and
he
fixed
on
his
visitor
a
look
which
had
the
inquisitive
piercing
expression
of
the
eyes
of
a
polish
jew
eyes
which
seem
to
have
ears
of
their
own
halpersohn
was
to
godefroid
s
great
astonishment
a
man
of
years
of
age
with
small
and
a
broad
powerful
chest
and
shoulders
there
was
something
oriental
about
the
man
and
his
face
in
its
youth
must
have
been
very
handsome
the
nose
was
hebraic
long
and
curved
like
a
damascus
blade
the
forehead
truly
polish
broad
and
noble
but
creased
like
a
bit
of
crumpled
paper
resembled
that
given
by
the
old
italian
masters
to
saint
joseph
the
eyes
of
a
and
circled
like
those
of
parrots
with
a
gray
and
wrinkled
membrane
expressed
slyness
and
avarice
in
an
eminent
degree
the
mouth
gashed
into
the
face
like
a
wound
added
to
the
already
sinister
expression
of
the
countenance
all
the
sarcasm
of
distrust
that
pale
thin
face
for
halpersohn
s
whole
person
was
remarkably
thin
surmounted
by
gray
hair
ended
in
a
long
and
very
thick
black
beard
slightly
touched
with
white
which
hid
fully
half
the
face
so
that
nothing
was
really
seen
of
it
but
the
forehead
nose
eyes
and
mouth
this
friend
of
the
revolutionist
lelewel
wore
a
black
velvet
cap
which
came
to
a
point
on
the
brow
and
took
a
high
light
worthy
of
the
touch
of
rembrandt
the
question
of
the
physician
who
has
since
become
so
celebrated
as
much
for
his
genius
as
for
his
avarice
caused
some
surprise
in
godefroid
s
mind
and
he
said
to
himself
i
wonder
if
he
takes
me
for
a
the
answer
to
this
mental
question
was
on
the
doctor
s
table
and
fireplace
godefroid
thought
he
was
the
first
to
arrive
he
was
really
the
last
preceding
clients
had
left
large
offerings
behind
them
among
them
godefroid
noticed
piles
of
twenty
and
gold
pieces
and
two
notes
of
a
thousand
francs
each
could
that
be
the
product
of
one
morning
he
doubted
it
and
suspected
the
pole
of
intentional
trickery
perhaps
the
grasping
but
infallible
doctor
took
this
method
of
showing
his
clients
mostly
rich
persons
that
gold
must
be
dropped
into
his
pouch
and
not
buttons
moses
halpersohn
was
undoubtedly
largely
paid
for
he
cured
and
he
cured
precisely
those
desperate
diseases
which
science
declares
incurable
it
is
not
known
in
europe
that
the
slav
races
possess
many
secrets
they
have
a
collection
of
sovereign
remedies
the
fruits
of
their
connection
with
the
chinese
persians
cossacks
turks
and
tartars
certain
peasant
women
in
poland
who
pass
for
witches
cure
insanity
radically
with
the
juice
of
herbs
a
vast
body
of
observation
not
codified
exists
in
poland
on
the
effects
of
certain
plants
and
certain
barks
of
trees
reduced
to
powder
which
are
transmitted
from
father
to
son
and
family
to
family
producing
cures
that
are
almost
miraculous
halpersohn
who
for
five
or
six
years
was
called
a
quack
on
account
of
his
powders
and
herb
medicines
had
the
innate
science
of
a
great
physician
not
only
had
he
studied
much
and
observed
much
but
he
had
travelled
in
every
part
of
germany
russia
persia
and
turkey
whence
he
had
gathered
many
a
traditionary
secret
and
as
he
knew
chemistry
he
became
a
living
volume
of
those
wonderful
recipes
scattered
among
the
wise
women
or
as
the
french
call
them
the
of
every
land
to
which
his
feet
had
gone
following
his
father
a
perambulating
trader
it
must
not
be
thought
that
the
scene
in
the
talisman
where
saladin
cures
the
king
of
england
is
a
fiction
halpersohn
possesses
a
silk
purse
which
he
steeps
in
water
till
the
liquid
is
slightly
colored
certain
fevers
yield
immediately
when
the
patient
has
drunk
the
prescribed
dose
of
it
the
virtue
of
plants
according
to
his
man
is
infinite
and
the
cure
of
the
worst
diseases
possible
nevertheless
he
like
the
rest
of
his
professional
brethren
stops
short
at
certain
incomprehensibilities
halpersohn
approved
of
the
invention
of
homoeopathy
more
on
account
of
its
therapeutics
than
for
its
medical
system
he
was
corresponding
at
this
time
with
hedenius
of
dresden
chelius
of
heidelburg
and
the
celebrated
german
doctors
all
the
while
holding
his
hand
closed
though
it
was
full
of
discoveries
he
wished
for
no
pupils
the
frame
was
in
keeping
with
this
embodiment
of
a
rembrandt
picture
the
study
hung
with
a
paper
imitating
green
velvet
was
shabbily
furnished
with
a
green
divan
the
cover
of
which
was
threadbare
a
green
carpet
was
on
the
floor
a
large
armchair
of
black
leather
intended
for
clients
stood
before
the
window
which
was
draped
with
green
curtains
a
desk
chair
of
roman
shape
made
in
mahogany
and
covered
with
green
morocco
was
the
doctor
s
own
seat
between
the
fireplace
and
the
long
table
at
which
he
wrote
a
common
iron
safe
stood
against
the
wall
and
on
it
was
a
clock
of
viennese
granite
surmounted
by
a
group
in
bronze
representing
cupid
playing
with
death
the
present
of
a
great
german
sculptor
whom
halpersohn
had
doubtless
cured
on
the
was
a
vase
between
two
candlesticks
and
no
other
ornament
on
either
side
of
the
divan
were
of
ebony
holding
plates
and
dishes
and
godefroid
also
noticed
upon
them
two
silver
bowls
glass
decanters
and
napkins
this
simplicity
which
amounted
almost
to
bareness
struck
godefroid
whose
quick
eye
took
it
all
in
as
he
recovered
his
monsieur
i
am
as
you
say
perfectly
well
myself
i
have
come
on
behalf
of
a
woman
to
whom
you
were
asked
to
pay
a
visit
some
time
ago
she
lives
on
the
boulevard
du
ah
yes
the
lady
who
has
sent
her
son
here
several
times
well
monsieur
let
her
come
here
to
come
here
repeated
godefroid
indignantly
monsieur
she
can
not
even
be
moved
from
her
bed
to
a
chair
they
lift
her
with
you
are
not
a
physician
i
suppose
said
the
jewish
doctor
with
a
singular
grimace
which
made
his
face
appear
more
wicked
than
it
really
was
if
the
baron
de
nucingen
sent
word
that
he
was
ill
and
wanted
you
to
visit
him
would
you
reply
let
him
come
here
to
me
i
should
go
to
him
said
the
jew
coldly
spitting
into
a
dutch
pot
made
of
mahogany
and
full
of
sand
you
would
go
said
godefroid
gently
because
the
baron
de
nucingen
has
two
millions
a
year
and
the
rest
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
i
should
well
monsieur
you
must
go
to
the
lady
on
the
boulevard
du
for
the
same
reason
without
possessing
the
fortune
of
the
baron
du
nucingen
i
am
here
to
tell
you
that
you
may
yourself
put
a
price
upon
this
lady
s
cure
or
upon
your
attendance
if
you
fail
i
am
ready
to
pay
it
in
advance
but
perhaps
monsieur
as
you
are
a
polish
refugee
and
i
believe
a
communist
the
lady
s
parentage
may
induce
you
to
make
a
sacrifice
to
poland
she
is
the
granddaughter
of
colonel
tarlowski
the
friend
of
monsieur
you
came
here
to
ask
me
to
cure
that
lady
and
not
to
give
me
advice
in
poland
i
am
a
pole
in
paris
i
am
parisian
every
man
does
good
in
his
own
way
the
greed
with
which
i
am
credited
is
not
without
its
motive
the
wealth
i
am
amassing
has
its
destination
it
is
a
sacred
one
i
sell
health
the
rich
can
afford
to
purchase
it
and
i
make
them
pay
the
poor
have
their
doctors
if
i
had
not
a
purpose
in
view
i
would
not
practise
medicine
i
live
soberly
and
i
spend
my
time
in
rushing
hither
and
thither
my
natural
inclination
is
to
be
lazy
and
i
used
to
be
a
gambler
draw
your
conclusions
young
man
you
are
too
young
still
to
judge
old
godefroid
was
silent
from
what
you
say
went
on
the
doctor
the
lady
in
question
is
the
granddaughter
of
that
imbecile
who
had
no
courage
but
that
of
fighting
and
who
took
part
in
delivering
over
his
country
to
catherine
ii
yes
well
be
at
her
house
monday
next
at
three
o
clock
said
halpersohn
taking
out
a
in
which
he
wrote
a
few
words
you
will
give
me
then
two
hundred
francs
and
if
i
promise
to
cure
the
patient
you
will
give
me
three
thousand
i
am
told
he
added
that
the
lady
has
shrunk
to
almost
monsieur
if
the
most
celebrated
doctors
in
paris
are
to
be
believed
it
is
a
neurotic
case
of
so
extraordinary
a
nature
that
they
denied
the
possibility
of
its
symptoms
until
they
saw
ah
yes
i
remember
now
what
the
young
lad
told
me
godefroid
withdrew
after
bowing
to
the
man
who
seemed
to
him
as
odd
as
he
was
extraordinary
nothing
about
him
indicated
a
physician
not
even
the
study
in
which
the
most
notable
object
was
the
iron
safe
made
by
huret
or
fichet
godefroid
had
just
time
to
get
to
the
passage
vivienne
before
the
shops
closed
for
the
day
and
there
he
bought
a
superb
accordion
which
he
ordered
sent
at
once
to
monsieur
bernard
giving
the
address
xvi
a
lesson
in
charity
from
the
doctor
s
house
godefroid
made
his
way
to
the
rue
chanoinesse
passing
along
the
quai
des
augustins
where
he
hoped
to
find
one
of
the
shops
of
the
open
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
do
so
and
had
a
long
talk
with
a
young
clerk
on
books
of
jurisprudence
when
he
reached
the
rue
chanoinesse
he
found
madame
de
la
chanterie
and
her
friends
just
returning
from
high
mass
in
reply
to
the
look
she
gave
him
godefroid
made
her
a
significant
sign
with
his
head
isn
t
our
dear
father
alain
here
he
said
no
she
replied
not
this
sunday
you
will
not
see
him
till
a
week
from
unless
you
go
where
he
gave
you
madame
said
godefroid
in
a
low
voice
you
know
he
doesn
t
intimidate
me
as
these
gentlemen
do
i
wanted
to
make
my
report
to
him
and
i
oh
you
i
can
tell
you
all
and
i
have
a
great
deal
to
tell
for
my
first
essay
i
have
found
a
most
extraordinary
misfortune
a
cruel
mingling
of
pauperism
and
the
need
for
luxuries
also
scenes
of
a
sublimity
which
surpasses
all
the
inventions
of
our
great
nature
especially
moral
nature
is
always
greater
than
art
just
as
god
is
greater
than
his
creatures
but
come
said
madame
de
la
chanterie
tell
me
the
particulars
of
your
first
trip
into
worlds
unknown
to
monsieur
nicolas
and
monsieur
joseph
for
the
abbe
de
veze
had
remained
a
few
moments
in
left
madame
de
la
chanterie
alone
with
godefroid
who
being
still
under
the
influence
of
the
emotions
he
had
gone
through
the
night
before
related
even
the
smallest
details
of
his
story
with
the
force
and
ardor
and
action
of
a
first
experience
of
such
a
spectacle
and
its
attendant
persons
and
things
his
narrative
had
a
great
success
for
the
calm
and
gentle
madame
de
la
chanterie
wept
accustomed
as
she
was
to
sound
the
depths
of
sorrows
you
did
quite
right
to
send
the
accordion
she
said
i
would
like
to
do
a
great
deal
more
said
godefroid
inasmuch
as
this
family
is
the
first
that
has
shown
me
the
pleasures
of
charity
i
should
like
to
obtain
for
that
splendid
old
man
a
full
return
for
his
great
book
i
don
t
know
if
you
have
confidence
enough
in
my
capacity
to
give
me
the
means
of
undertaking
such
an
affair
from
information
i
have
obtained
it
will
cost
nine
thousand
francs
to
manufacture
an
edition
of
fifteen
hundred
copies
and
their
selling
value
will
be
thousand
francs
but
as
we
should
have
to
pay
off
the
three
thousand
and
some
hundred
francs
due
to
barbet
it
would
be
an
outlay
of
twelve
thousand
francs
to
risk
oh
madame
if
you
only
knew
what
bitter
regrets
i
feel
for
having
dissipated
my
little
fortune
the
spirit
of
charity
has
appeared
to
me
it
fills
me
with
the
ardor
of
an
initiate
i
wish
to
renounce
the
world
i
long
to
embrace
the
life
of
these
gentlemen
and
be
worthy
of
you
many
a
time
during
the
last
two
days
i
have
blessed
the
chance
that
brought
me
to
this
house
i
will
obey
you
in
all
things
until
you
judge
me
fit
to
be
one
of
then
said
madame
de
la
chanterie
after
reflecting
for
a
time
listen
to
me
for
i
have
important
things
to
tell
you
have
been
allured
my
child
by
the
poesy
of
misfortune
yes
misfortunes
are
often
poetical
for
as
i
think
poesy
is
a
certain
effect
on
the
sensibilities
and
sorrows
affect
the
sensibilities
life
is
so
intense
in
grief
yes
madame
i
know
that
i
have
been
gripped
by
the
demon
of
curiosity
but
how
could
i
help
it
i
have
not
yet
acquired
the
habit
of
penetrating
to
the
heart
of
these
great
misfortunes
i
can
not
go
among
them
with
the
calmness
of
your
three
soldiers
of
the
lord
but
let
me
tell
you
it
is
since
i
have
recovered
from
that
first
excitement
that
i
have
chiefly
longed
to
devote
myself
to
your
listen
to
me
my
dear
angel
said
madame
de
la
chanterie
who
uttered
the
last
three
words
with
a
gentle
solemnity
that
touched
the
young
man
strangely
we
have
forbidden
ourselves
absolutely
and
we
do
not
trifle
with
words
here
what
is
forbidden
no
longer
occupies
our
minds
we
have
forbidden
ourselves
to
enter
into
any
speculations
to
print
a
book
for
sale
on
the
chance
of
profit
is
a
matter
of
business
and
any
operation
of
that
kind
would
throw
us
into
all
the
entanglements
of
commerce
certainly
your
scheme
seems
to
me
feasible
even
necessary
but
do
you
think
it
is
the
first
that
has
offered
itself
a
score
of
times
a
hundred
times
we
have
come
upon
just
such
ways
of
saving
families
or
firms
what
would
have
become
of
us
if
we
had
taken
part
in
such
affairs
we
should
be
merchants
no
our
true
partnership
with
misfortune
is
not
to
take
the
work
into
our
own
hands
but
to
help
the
unfortunate
to
work
themselves
before
long
you
will
meet
with
misfortunes
more
bitter
still
than
these
would
you
then
do
the
same
thing
that
is
take
the
burdens
of
those
unfortunates
wholly
on
yourself
you
would
soon
be
overwhelmed
reflect
too
my
dear
child
that
for
the
last
year
even
the
messieurs
mongenod
find
our
accounts
too
heavy
for
them
half
your
time
would
be
taken
up
in
merely
keeping
our
books
we
have
over
two
thousand
debtors
in
paris
and
we
must
keep
the
record
of
their
debts
not
that
we
ask
for
payment
we
simply
wait
we
calculate
that
if
half
the
money
we
expect
is
lost
the
other
half
comes
back
to
us
sometimes
doubled
now
suppose
your
monsieur
bernard
dies
the
twelve
thousand
francs
are
probably
lost
but
if
you
cure
his
daughter
if
his
grandson
is
put
in
the
way
of
succeeding
if
he
comes
some
day
a
magistrate
then
when
the
family
is
prosperous
they
will
remember
the
debt
and
return
the
money
of
the
poor
with
usury
do
you
know
that
more
than
one
family
whom
we
have
rescued
from
poverty
and
put
upon
their
feet
on
the
road
to
prosperity
by
loans
of
money
without
interest
have
laid
aside
a
portion
for
the
poor
and
have
returned
to
us
the
money
loaned
doubled
and
sometimes
tripled
those
are
our
only
speculations
moreover
reflect
that
what
is
now
interesting
you
so
deeply
and
you
ought
to
be
interested
in
it
namely
the
sale
of
this
lawyer
s
book
depends
on
the
value
of
the
work
have
you
read
it
besides
though
the
book
may
be
an
excellent
one
how
many
excellent
books
remain
one
two
three
years
without
obtaining
the
success
they
deserve
alas
how
many
crowns
of
fame
are
laid
upon
a
grave
i
know
that
publishers
have
ways
of
negotiating
and
realizing
profits
which
make
their
business
the
most
hazardous
to
do
with
and
the
most
difficult
to
unravel
of
all
the
trades
of
paris
monsieur
joseph
can
tell
you
of
these
difficulties
inherent
in
the
making
of
books
thus
you
see
we
are
sensible
we
have
experience
of
all
miseries
also
of
all
trades
for
we
have
studied
paris
for
many
years
the
mongenods
have
helped
us
in
this
they
have
been
like
torches
to
us
it
is
through
them
that
we
know
how
the
bank
of
france
holds
the
publishing
business
under
constant
suspicion
although
it
is
one
of
the
most
profitable
trades
it
is
unsound
as
for
the
four
thousand
francs
necessary
to
save
this
noble
family
from
the
horrors
of
penury
for
that
poor
boy
and
his
grandfather
must
be
fed
and
clothed
properly
i
will
give
them
to
you
at
once
there
are
sufferings
miseries
wants
which
we
immediately
relieve
without
hesitation
without
even
asking
whom
we
help
religion
honor
character
are
all
indifferent
to
us
but
when
it
comes
to
lending
money
to
the
poor
to
assist
them
in
any
active
form
of
industry
or
commerce
then
we
require
guarantees
with
all
the
sternness
of
usurers
so
you
must
my
dear
child
limit
your
enthusiasm
for
this
unhappy
family
to
finding
for
the
father
an
honest
publisher
this
concerns
monsieur
joseph
he
knows
lawyers
professors
authors
of
works
on
jurisprudence
i
will
speak
to
him
and
next
sunday
he
will
be
sure
to
have
some
good
advice
to
give
you
don
t
feel
uneasy
some
way
will
certainly
be
found
to
solve
the
difficulty
perhaps
it
would
be
well
however
if
monsieur
joseph
were
to
read
the
lawyer
s
book
if
you
think
it
can
be
done
you
had
better
obtain
the
godefroid
was
amazed
at
the
good
sense
of
this
woman
whom
he
had
thought
controlled
by
the
spirit
of
charity
only
he
took
her
beautiful
hand
and
kissed
it
saying
you
are
good
sense
and
judgment
too
we
must
be
all
that
in
our
business
she
replied
with
the
soft
gaiety
of
a
real
saint
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
and
then
godefroid
exclaimed
two
thousand
debtors
did
you
say
that
madame
two
thousand
accounts
to
keep
why
it
is
immense
oh
i
meant
two
thousand
accounts
which
rely
for
liquidation
as
i
told
you
on
the
delicacy
and
good
feeling
of
our
debtors
but
there
are
fully
three
thousand
other
families
whom
we
help
who
make
us
no
other
return
than
thanks
to
god
this
is
why
we
feel
as
i
told
you
the
necessity
of
keeping
books
ourselves
if
you
prove
to
us
your
discretion
and
capacity
you
shall
be
if
you
like
our
accountant
we
keep
a
a
ledger
a
book
of
current
accounts
and
a
we
have
many
notes
but
we
lose
a
great
deal
of
time
in
looking
them
up
ah
here
are
the
gentlemen
she
added
godefroid
grave
and
thoughtful
took
little
part
in
the
general
conversation
which
now
followed
he
was
stunned
by
the
communication
madame
de
la
chanterie
had
just
made
to
him
in
a
tone
which
implied
that
she
wished
to
reward
his
ardor
five
thousand
families
assisted
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
if
they
were
to
cost
what
i
am
to
spend
on
monsieur
bernard
we
must
have
millions
scattered
through
this
thought
was
the
last
expiring
movement
of
the
spirit
of
the
world
which
had
slowly
and
insensibly
become
extinguished
in
godefroid
on
reflection
he
saw
that
the
united
fortunes
of
madame
de
la
chanterie
messieurs
alain
nicolas
joseph
and
that
of
judge
popinot
the
gifts
obtained
through
the
abbe
de
veze
and
the
assistance
lent
by
the
firm
of
mongenod
must
produce
a
large
capital
and
that
this
capital
increased
during
the
last
dozen
years
by
grateful
returns
from
those
assisted
must
have
grown
like
a
snowball
inasmuch
as
the
charitable
stewards
of
it
spent
so
little
on
themselves
little
by
little
he
began
to
see
clearly
into
this
vast
work
and
his
desire
to
in
it
increased
he
was
preparing
at
nine
o
clock
to
return
on
foot
to
the
boulevard
du
but
madame
de
la
chanterie
fearing
the
solitude
of
that
neighborhood
at
a
late
hour
made
him
take
a
cab
when
he
reached
the
house
godefroid
heard
the
sound
of
an
instrument
though
the
shutters
were
so
carefully
closed
that
not
a
ray
of
light
issued
through
them
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
landing
auguste
who
was
probably
on
the
watch
for
him
opened
the
door
of
monsieur
bernard
s
apartment
and
said
mamma
would
like
to
see
you
and
my
grandfather
offers
you
a
cup
of
when
godefroid
entered
the
patient
seemed
to
him
transfigured
by
the
pleasure
she
felt
in
making
music
her
face
was
radiant
her
eyes
were
sparkling
like
diamonds
i
ought
to
have
waited
to
let
you
hear
the
first
sounds
she
said
to
godefroid
but
i
flung
myself
upon
the
little
organ
as
a
starving
man
flings
himself
on
food
you
have
a
soul
that
comprehends
me
and
i
know
you
will
vanda
made
a
sign
to
her
son
who
placed
himself
in
such
a
way
as
to
press
with
his
foot
the
pedal
which
filled
the
bellows
and
then
the
invalid
whose
fingers
had
for
the
time
recovered
all
their
strength
and
agility
raising
her
eyes
to
heaven
like
saint
cecilia
played
the
prayer
of
moses
in
egypt
which
her
son
had
bought
for
her
and
which
she
had
learned
by
heart
in
a
few
hours
godefroid
recognized
in
her
playing
the
same
quality
as
in
chopin
s
the
soul
was
satisfied
by
divine
sounds
of
which
the
dominant
note
was
that
of
tender
melancholy
monsieur
bernard
had
received
godefroid
with
a
look
that
was
long
a
stranger
to
his
eyes
if
tears
were
not
forever
dried
at
their
source
withered
by
such
scorching
sorrows
that
look
would
have
been
tearful
the
old
man
sat
playing
with
his
and
looking
at
his
daughter
in
silent
ecstasy
madame
said
godefroid
when
the
music
ceased
your
fate
will
be
decided
i
bring
you
good
news
the
celebrated
halpersohn
is
coming
to
see
you
at
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
he
has
promised
added
godefroid
in
a
low
voice
to
monsieur
bernard
to
tell
me
the
exact
the
old
man
rose
and
grasping
godefroid
s
hand
drew
him
to
a
corner
of
the
room
beside
the
fireplace
ah
what
a
night
i
shall
pass
a
definitive
decision
my
daughter
cured
or
doomed
courage
said
godefroid
after
tea
come
out
with
my
child
my
child
don
t
play
any
more
said
the
old
man
you
will
bring
on
an
attack
such
a
strain
upon
your
strength
must
end
in
he
made
auguste
take
away
the
instrument
and
offered
a
cup
of
tea
to
his
daughter
with
the
coaxing
manner
of
a
nurse
quieting
the
petulance
of
a
child
what
is
the
doctor
like
she
asked
her
mind
already
distracted
by
the
prospect
of
seeing
a
new
person
vanda
like
all
prisoners
was
full
of
eager
curiosity
when
the
physical
phenomena
of
her
malady
ceased
they
seemed
to
betake
themselves
to
the
moral
nature
she
conceived
the
strangest
fancies
the
most
violent
caprices
she
insisted
on
seeing
rossini
and
wept
when
her
father
whom
she
believed
to
be
all
powerful
refused
to
fetch
him
godefroid
now
gave
her
a
minute
account
of
the
jewish
doctor
and
his
study
of
which
she
knew
nothing
for
monsieur
bernard
had
cautioned
auguste
not
to
tell
his
mother
of
his
visits
to
halpersohn
so
much
had
he
feared
to
rouse
hopes
in
her
mind
which
might
not
be
realized
vanda
hung
upon
godefroid
s
words
like
one
fascinated
and
she
fell
into
a
sort
of
ecstasy
in
her
passionate
desire
to
see
this
strange
polish
doctor
poland
has
produced
many
singular
mysterious
beings
said
monsieur
bernard
for
instance
besides
this
extraordinary
doctor
we
have
hoene
wronski
the
enlightened
mathematician
the
poet
mickievicz
towianksi
the
mystic
and
chopin
whose
talent
is
supernatural
great
national
convulsions
always
produce
various
species
of
dwarfed
oh
dear
papa
what
a
man
you
are
if
you
would
only
write
down
what
we
hear
you
say
merely
to
amuse
me
you
would
make
your
reputation
fancy
monsieur
my
dear
old
father
invents
wonderful
stories
when
i
have
no
novels
to
read
he
often
puts
me
to
sleep
in
that
way
his
voice
lulls
me
and
he
quiets
my
mind
with
his
wit
who
can
ever
reward
him
auguste
my
child
you
ought
for
my
sake
to
kiss
the
print
of
your
grandfather
s
the
young
man
raised
his
beautiful
moist
eyes
to
his
mother
and
the
look
he
gave
her
full
of
a
compassion
was
a
poem
godefroid
rose
took
the
lad
s
hand
and
pressed
it
god
has
placed
two
angels
beside
you
madame
he
said
yes
i
know
that
and
for
that
reason
i
often
reproach
myself
for
harassing
them
come
my
dear
auguste
and
kiss
your
mother
he
is
a
child
monsieur
of
whom
all
mothers
might
be
proud
pure
as
gold
frank
and
honest
a
soul
without
sin
but
too
passionate
a
soul
alas
like
that
of
his
poor
mother
perhaps
god
has
fastened
me
in
this
bed
to
keep
me
from
the
follies
of
women
who
have
too
much
heart
she
added
smiling
godefroid
replied
with
a
smile
and
a
bow
adieu
monsieur
and
thank
your
friend
for
the
instrument
tell
him
it
makes
the
happiness
of
a
poor
monsieur
said
godefroid
when
they
were
alone
in
the
latter
s
room
i
think
i
may
assure
you
that
you
shall
not
be
robbed
by
that
trio
of
bloodsuckers
i
have
the
necessary
sum
to
free
your
book
but
you
must
first
show
me
your
written
agreement
with
them
and
after
that
in
order
to
do
still
more
for
you
you
must
let
me
have
your
work
to
read
not
i
myself
of
course
i
have
not
knowledge
enough
to
judge
of
it
but
a
former
magistrate
a
lawyer
of
eminence
and
of
perfect
integrity
who
will
undertake
according
to
what
he
thinks
of
the
book
to
find
you
an
honorable
publisher
with
whom
you
can
make
an
equitable
agreement
this
however
i
will
not
insist
upon
meantime
here
are
five
hundred
francs
he
added
giving
a
to
the
stupefied
old
man
to
meet
your
present
needs
i
do
not
ask
for
any
receipt
you
will
be
under
obligations
to
your
own
conscience
only
and
that
conscience
is
not
to
move
you
until
you
have
recovered
a
sufficient
competence
i
undertake
to
pay
who
are
you
then
asked
the
old
man
dropping
into
a
chair
i
myself
replied
godefroid
am
nothing
but
i
serve
powerful
persons
to
whom
your
distress
is
known
and
who
feel
an
interest
in
you
ask
me
nothing
more
about
but
what
induces
them
to
do
this
said
the
old
man
religion
is
it
possible
yes
the
catholic
apostolic
and
roman
ah
do
you
belong
to
the
order
of
jesus
no
monsieur
replied
godefroid
do
not
feel
uneasy
these
persons
have
no
designs
upon
you
except
that
of
helping
you
to
restore
your
family
to
can
philanthropy
be
anything
but
vanity
ah
monsieur
said
godefroid
hastily
do
not
insult
the
virtue
defined
by
saint
paul
sacred
catholic
love
monsieur
bernard
hearing
this
answer
began
to
stride
up
and
down
with
long
steps
i
accept
he
said
suddenly
and
i
have
but
one
way
of
thanking
you
and
that
is
to
offer
you
my
work
the
notes
and
citations
are
unnecessary
to
the
magistrate
you
speak
of
and
i
have
still
two
months
work
to
do
in
arranging
them
for
the
press
i
will
give
you
the
five
volumes
he
added
offering
godefroid
his
hand
can
i
have
made
a
conversion
thought
godefroid
struck
by
the
new
expression
which
he
saw
on
the
old
man
s
face
xvii
halpersohn
the
next
afternoon
at
three
o
clock
a
cabriolet
stopped
before
the
house
and
godefroid
saw
halpersohn
getting
out
of
it
wrapped
in
a
monstrous
pelisse
the
cold
had
strengthened
during
the
night
the
thermometer
marking
ten
degrees
of
it
the
jewish
doctor
examined
with
curious
eyes
though
furtively
the
room
in
which
his
client
of
the
day
before
received
him
and
godefroid
detected
the
suspicious
thought
which
darted
from
his
eyes
like
the
sharp
point
of
a
dagger
this
rapid
conception
of
distrust
gave
godefroid
a
cold
chill
for
he
thought
within
himself
that
such
a
man
would
be
pitiless
in
all
relations
it
is
so
natural
to
suppose
that
genius
is
connected
with
goodness
that
a
strong
sensation
of
disgust
took
possession
of
him
monsieur
he
said
i
see
that
the
simplicity
of
my
room
makes
you
uneasy
therefore
you
need
not
be
surprised
at
my
method
of
proceeding
here
are
your
two
hundred
francs
and
here
too
are
three
notes
of
a
thousand
francs
each
he
added
drawing
from
his
the
money
madame
de
la
chanterie
had
given
him
to
release
monsieur
bernard
s
book
but
in
case
you
still
feel
doubtful
of
my
solvency
i
offer
you
as
reference
mongenod
bankers
rue
de
la
i
know
them
said
halpersohn
putting
the
ten
gold
pieces
into
his
pocket
he
ll
inquire
of
them
thought
godefroid
where
is
the
patient
asked
the
doctor
rising
like
a
man
who
knows
the
value
of
time
this
way
monsieur
said
godefroid
preceding
him
to
show
the
way
the
jew
examined
with
a
shrewd
and
suspicious
eye
the
places
he
passed
through
giving
them
the
keen
rapid
glance
of
a
spy
he
saw
all
the
horrors
of
poverty
through
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
the
grandfather
and
the
grandson
lived
for
unfortunately
monsieur
bernard
had
gone
in
to
change
his
clothes
before
entering
his
daughter
s
room
and
in
his
haste
to
open
the
outer
door
to
the
doctor
he
had
forgotten
to
close
that
of
his
lair
he
bowed
in
a
stately
manner
to
halpersohn
and
opened
the
door
of
his
daughter
s
room
cautiously
vanda
my
child
here
is
the
doctor
he
said
then
he
stood
aside
to
allow
halpersohn
who
kept
on
his
pelisse
to
pass
him
the
jew
was
evidently
surprised
at
the
luxury
of
the
room
which
in
this
quarter
and
more
especially
in
this
house
was
an
anomaly
but
his
surprise
only
lasted
for
an
instant
for
he
had
seen
among
german
and
russian
jews
many
instances
of
the
same
contrast
between
apparent
misery
and
hoarded
wealth
as
he
walked
from
the
door
to
the
bed
he
kept
his
eye
on
the
patient
and
the
moment
he
reached
her
he
said
in
polish
you
are
a
pole
no
i
am
not
my
mother
whom
did
your
grandfather
colonel
tarlowski
marry
a
from
what
province
a
soboleska
of
very
good
monsieur
is
your
father
monsieur
he
said
turning
to
the
old
man
your
wife
is
dead
said
monsieur
bernard
was
she
very
fair
said
halpersohn
showing
a
slight
impatience
at
being
interrupted
here
is
her
portrait
said
monsieur
bernard
unhooking
from
the
wall
a
handsome
frame
which
enclosed
several
fine
miniatures
halpersohn
felt
the
head
and
handled
the
hair
of
the
patient
while
he
looked
at
the
portrait
of
vanda
tarlowska
born
countess
sobolewska
relate
to
me
the
symptoms
of
your
illness
he
said
placing
himself
on
the
sofa
and
looking
fixedly
at
vanda
during
the
twenty
minutes
the
history
given
alternately
by
the
father
and
daughter
lasted
how
old
are
you
ah
good
he
cried
rising
i
will
answer
for
the
cure
mind
i
do
not
say
that
i
can
restore
the
use
of
her
legs
but
cured
of
the
disease
that
she
shall
be
only
i
must
have
her
in
a
private
hospital
under
my
own
but
monsieur
my
daughter
can
not
be
moved
i
will
answer
for
her
said
halpersohn
curtly
but
i
will
answer
for
her
only
on
those
conditions
she
will
have
to
exchange
her
present
malady
for
another
still
more
terrible
which
may
last
a
year
six
months
at
the
very
least
you
may
come
and
see
her
at
the
hospital
since
you
are
her
are
you
certain
of
curing
her
said
monsieur
bernard
certain
repeated
the
jew
madame
has
in
her
body
an
element
a
vitiated
fluid
the
national
disease
and
it
must
be
eliminated
you
must
bring
her
to
me
at
challot
rue
private
hospital
of
doctor
how
can
i
on
a
stretcher
just
as
all
sick
persons
are
carried
to
but
the
removal
will
kill
her
as
he
said
the
word
in
a
curt
tone
he
was
already
at
the
door
godefroid
rejoined
him
on
the
staircase
the
jew
who
was
stifling
with
heat
said
in
his
ear
besides
the
three
thousand
francs
the
cost
will
be
fifteen
francs
a
day
payable
three
months
in
very
good
monsieur
and
continued
godefroid
putting
one
foot
on
the
step
of
the
cabriolet
into
which
the
doctor
had
sprung
you
say
you
will
answer
for
the
cure
i
will
answer
for
it
said
the
jewish
doctor
are
you
in
love
with
the
lady
no
replied
godefroid
you
must
not
repeat
what
i
am
about
to
say
to
you
i
only
say
it
to
prove
to
you
that
i
am
certain
of
a
cure
if
you
are
guilty
of
the
slightest
indiscretion
you
will
kill
godefroid
replied
with
a
gesture
only
for
the
last
seventeen
years
she
has
been
a
victim
to
the
element
in
her
system
called
which
has
produced
all
these
ravages
i
have
seen
more
terrible
cases
than
this
now
i
alone
in
the
present
day
know
how
to
bring
this
disease
to
a
crisis
and
force
it
outward
so
as
to
obtain
a
chance
to
cure
it
for
it
can
not
always
be
cured
you
see
monsieur
that
i
am
disinterested
if
this
lady
were
of
great
importance
a
baronne
de
nucingen
or
any
other
wife
or
daughter
of
a
modern
croesus
this
cure
would
bring
me
one
hundred
two
hundred
thousand
francs
in
short
anything
i
chose
to
ask
for
it
however
it
is
only
a
trifling
loss
to
balzac
s
description
of
does
not
agree
with
that
given
in
english
medical
dictionaries
and
cyclopedias
but
as
the
book
was
written
at
wierschovnia
poland
in
when
he
was
attended
by
a
celebrated
polish
physician
and
as
moreover
he
was
always
so
scrupulously
accurate
in
his
descriptions
it
is
fair
to
suppose
that
he
knew
of
some
form
of
the
disease
other
than
that
given
in
the
books
his
account
probably
applies
to
the
period
before
it
takes
the
visible
form
described
in
the
books
about
conveying
her
bah
she
ll
seem
to
be
dying
but
she
won
t
die
there
s
life
enough
in
her
to
last
a
hundred
years
when
the
disease
is
out
of
her
system
come
jacques
drive
on
quick
rue
de
monsieur
quick
he
said
to
his
man
godefroid
was
left
on
the
boulevard
gazing
stupidly
after
the
cabriolet
who
is
that
queer
man
in
a
bearskin
asked
madame
vauthier
whom
nothing
escaped
is
it
true
what
the
man
in
the
cabriolet
told
me
that
he
is
one
of
the
greatest
doctors
in
paris
what
is
that
to
you
oh
nothing
at
all
she
replied
making
a
face
you
made
a
great
mistake
in
not
putting
yourself
on
my
side
said
godefroid
returning
slowly
to
the
house
you
would
have
made
more
out
of
me
than
you
will
ever
get
from
barbet
and
metivier
from
whom
mark
my
words
you
ll
get
i
am
not
for
them
particularly
said
madame
vauthier
shrugging
her
shoulders
monsieur
barbet
is
my
proprietor
that
s
all
it
required
two
days
persuasion
to
induce
monsieur
bernard
to
separate
from
his
daughter
and
take
her
to
chaillot
godefroid
and
the
old
man
made
the
trip
walking
on
each
side
of
the
litter
canopied
with
blue
and
white
striped
linen
in
which
was
the
dear
patient
partly
bound
to
a
mattress
so
much
did
her
father
dread
the
possible
convulsions
of
a
nervous
attack
they
started
at
three
o
clock
and
reached
their
destination
at
five
just
as
evening
was
coming
on
godefroid
paid
the
sum
demanded
for
three
months
board
in
advance
being
careful
to
obtain
a
receipt
for
the
money
when
he
went
back
to
pay
the
bearers
of
the
litter
he
was
followed
by
monsieur
bernard
who
took
from
beneath
the
mattress
a
bulky
package
carefully
sealed
up
and
gave
it
to
godefroid
one
of
these
men
will
fetch
you
a
cab
said
the
old
man
for
you
can
not
carry
these
four
volumes
under
your
arm
that
is
my
book
give
it
to
your
reader
he
may
keep
it
the
whole
of
the
coming
week
i
shall
stay
at
least
that
time
in
this
quarter
for
i
can
not
leave
my
daughter
in
such
total
abandonment
i
trust
my
grandson
he
can
take
care
of
our
rooms
especially
if
you
keep
an
eye
on
him
if
i
were
what
i
once
was
i
would
ask
you
the
name
of
my
critic
the
former
magistrate
you
spoke
of
there
were
but
few
of
them
whom
i
did
not
oh
there
s
no
mystery
about
it
said
godefroid
interrupting
monsieur
bernard
now
that
you
have
shown
this
entire
confidence
in
trusting
me
with
your
book
i
will
tell
you
that
your
censor
is
the
former
president
lecamus
de
oh
yes
of
the
royal
court
of
paris
take
him
the
book
he
is
one
of
the
noblest
characters
of
the
present
day
he
and
the
late
popinot
a
judge
of
the
lower
court
were
both
worthy
of
the
days
of
the
old
parliaments
all
my
fears
if
i
had
any
are
dissipated
where
does
he
live
i
should
like
to
go
and
thank
him
for
the
trouble
he
is
you
will
find
him
in
the
rue
chanoinesse
under
the
name
of
monsieur
joseph
i
am
going
there
now
where
is
that
agreement
you
made
with
your
swindlers
auguste
will
give
it
to
you
said
the
old
man
the
courtyard
of
the
hospital
a
cab
was
now
brought
up
by
the
porter
and
godefroid
jumped
into
it
promising
the
coachman
a
good
pourboire
if
he
would
get
him
to
the
rue
chanoinesse
in
good
time
for
he
wanted
to
dine
there
half
an
hour
after
vanda
s
departure
three
men
dressed
in
black
whom
madame
vauthier
let
into
the
house
by
the
door
on
the
rue
des
champs
filed
up
the
staircase
accompanied
by
their
female
judas
and
knocked
gently
at
the
door
of
monsieur
bernard
s
lodging
as
it
happened
to
be
a
thursday
auguste
was
at
home
he
opened
the
door
and
the
three
men
glided
in
like
shadows
what
do
you
want
messieurs
asked
the
lad
these
are
the
rooms
of
monsieur
bernard
that
is
monsieur
le
baron
are
they
not
yes
but
what
do
you
want
you
know
very
well
young
man
what
we
want
we
are
informed
that
your
grandfather
has
left
this
house
with
a
covered
litter
that
s
not
surprising
he
had
the
right
to
do
so
but
i
am
the
sheriff
and
i
have
come
to
seize
everything
he
has
left
on
monday
he
received
a
summons
to
pay
three
thousand
francs
with
interest
and
costs
to
monsieur
metivier
under
pain
of
arrest
for
debt
duly
notified
to
him
and
like
an
old
stager
who
is
up
to
the
tricks
of
his
own
trade
he
has
walked
off
just
in
time
however
if
we
can
t
catch
him
his
furniture
hasn
t
taken
wings
you
see
we
know
all
about
it
young
here
are
the
stamped
papers
your
grandpapa
didn
t
choose
to
take
said
madame
vauthier
thrusting
three
writs
into
auguste
s
hand
remain
here
madame
said
the
sheriff
we
shall
make
you
legal
guardian
of
the
property
the
law
gives
you
forty
sous
a
day
and
that
s
not
to
be
sneezed
ha
now
i
shall
see
the
inside
of
that
fine
bedroom
cried
the
vauthier
you
shall
not
go
into
my
mother
s
room
said
the
young
lad
in
a
threatening
voice
springing
between
the
door
and
the
three
men
in
black
at
a
sign
from
the
sheriff
two
of
the
men
seized
auguste
no
resistance
young
man
you
are
not
master
here
said
the
sheriff
we
shall
draw
up
the
and
you
will
sleep
in
hearing
that
dreadful
word
auguste
burst
into
tears
ah
how
fortunate
he
cried
that
mamma
has
gone
it
would
have
killed
a
conference
now
took
place
between
the
sheriff
the
other
men
and
vauthier
by
which
auguste
discovered
although
they
spoke
in
a
low
voice
that
his
grandfather
s
manuscripts
were
what
they
chiefly
wanted
on
that
he
opened
the
door
of
his
mother
s
bedroom
go
in
he
said
but
take
care
to
do
no
injury
you
will
be
paid
then
he
went
off
weeping
into
the
lair
seized
his
grandfather
s
notes
and
stuck
them
into
the
stove
in
which
as
he
knew
very
well
there
was
not
a
spark
of
fire
the
thing
was
done
so
rapidly
that
the
sheriff
a
sly
keen
fellow
worthy
of
his
clients
barbet
and
metivier
found
the
lad
weeping
in
his
chair
when
he
entered
the
wretched
room
after
assuring
himself
that
the
manuscripts
were
not
in
the
antechamber
though
it
is
not
permissible
to
seize
books
or
manuscripts
for
debt
the
bill
of
sale
which
monsieur
bernard
had
made
of
his
work
justified
this
proceeding
it
was
however
easy
to
oppose
various
delays
to
this
seizure
and
monsieur
bernard
had
he
been
there
would
not
have
failed
to
do
so
for
that
reason
the
whole
affair
had
been
conducted
slyly
madame
vauthier
had
not
attempted
to
give
the
writs
to
monsieur
bernard
she
meant
to
have
flung
them
into
the
room
on
entering
behind
the
sheriff
s
men
so
to
give
the
appearance
of
their
being
in
the
old
man
s
possession
the
of
the
seizure
took
an
hour
to
write
down
the
sheriff
omitted
nothing
and
declared
that
the
value
of
the
property
seized
was
sufficient
to
pay
the
debt
as
soon
as
he
and
his
men
had
departed
auguste
took
the
writs
and
rushed
to
the
hospital
to
find
his
grandfather
the
sheriff
having
told
him
that
madame
vauthier
was
now
responsible
under
heavy
penalties
for
the
safety
of
the
property
he
could
leave
the
house
without
fear
of
robbery
the
idea
of
his
grandfather
being
dragged
to
prison
for
debt
drove
the
poor
lad
if
not
exactly
crazy
at
any
rate
as
crazy
as
youth
becomes
under
one
of
those
dangerous
and
fatal
excitements
in
which
all
powers
ferment
at
once
and
lead
as
often
to
evil
actions
as
to
heroic
deeds
when
he
reached
the
rue
the
porter
told
him
that
he
did
not
know
what
had
become
of
the
father
of
the
lady
who
had
arrived
that
afternoon
the
orders
of
monsieur
halpersohn
were
to
admit
no
one
to
see
her
for
the
next
eight
days
under
pain
of
putting
her
life
in
danger
this
answer
brought
auguste
s
exasperation
to
a
crisis
he
returned
to
the
boulevard
du
turning
over
in
his
mind
the
wildest
and
most
extravagant
plans
of
action
he
reached
home
at
eight
o
clock
half
famished
and
so
exhausted
with
hunger
and
distress
that
he
listened
to
madame
vauthier
when
she
asked
him
to
share
her
supper
which
happened
to
be
a
mutton
stew
with
potatoes
the
poor
lad
fell
half
dead
upon
a
chair
in
that
atrocious
woman
s
room
persuaded
by
the
wheedling
and
honeyed
words
of
the
old
vulture
he
replied
to
a
few
questions
about
godefroid
which
she
adroitly
put
to
him
letting
her
discover
that
it
was
really
her
other
lodger
who
was
to
pay
his
grandfather
s
debts
the
next
day
and
also
that
it
was
to
him
they
owed
the
improvement
in
their
condition
during
the
past
week
the
widow
listened
to
these
confidences
with
a
dubious
air
plying
auguste
with
several
glasses
of
wine
meantime
about
ten
o
clock
a
cab
stopped
before
the
house
and
madame
vauthier
looking
out
exclaimed
oh
it
is
monsieur
auguste
at
once
took
the
key
of
his
apartment
and
went
up
to
meet
the
protector
of
his
family
but
he
found
godefroid
s
face
and
manner
so
changed
that
he
hesitated
to
address
him
until
generous
lad
that
he
was
the
thought
of
his
grandfather
s
danger
came
over
him
and
gave
him
courage
xviii
who
monsieur
bernard
was
the
cause
of
this
change
and
of
the
sternness
in
godefroid
s
face
was
an
event
which
had
just
taken
place
in
the
rue
chanoinesse
when
the
initiate
arrived
there
he
found
madame
de
la
chanterie
and
her
friends
assembled
in
the
salon
awaiting
dinner
and
he
instantly
took
monsieur
joseph
apart
to
give
him
the
four
volumes
on
the
spirit
of
modern
monsieur
joseph
took
the
voluminous
manuscript
to
his
room
and
returned
for
dinner
then
after
sharing
in
the
conversation
for
part
of
the
evening
he
went
back
to
his
room
intending
to
begin
the
reading
of
the
book
that
night
godefroid
was
much
astonished
when
manon
came
to
him
soon
after
monsieur
joseph
s
retirement
and
asked
if
he
would
at
once
go
up
and
speak
to
that
gentleman
he
went
up
conducted
by
manon
and
was
unable
to
pay
any
heed
to
the
apartment
which
he
had
never
before
entered
so
amazed
was
he
by
the
agitated
look
and
manner
of
a
man
who
was
usually
calm
and
placid
do
you
know
asked
monsieur
joseph
once
more
a
judge
who
the
author
of
this
work
is
he
is
monsieur
bernard
said
godefroid
i
know
him
only
under
that
name
i
did
not
open
the
true
said
monsieur
joseph
as
if
to
himself
i
broke
the
seals
myself
you
have
not
tried
to
find
out
anything
about
his
antecedents
no
i
only
know
that
he
made
a
with
the
daughter
of
general
tarlowski
that
the
daughter
is
named
after
the
mother
vanda
the
grandson
is
called
auguste
and
i
have
seen
a
portrait
of
monsieur
bernard
in
the
red
robes
of
a
president
of
the
royal
here
read
that
said
monsieur
joseph
pointing
to
the
titlepage
of
the
manuscript
written
probably
in
auguste
s
handwriting
on
the
spirit
of
modern
laws
by
macloud
baron
bourlac
formerly
to
the
royal
court
of
rouen
grand
officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
ha
the
slayer
of
madame
s
daughter
of
the
chevalier
du
vissard
the
man
who
condemned
her
to
twenty
years
imprisonment
said
godefroid
in
a
feeble
voice
his
legs
gave
way
under
him
and
he
dropped
into
a
chair
what
a
beginning
he
muttered
this
matter
my
dear
godefroid
resumed
monsieur
joseph
concerns
us
all
you
have
done
your
part
leave
the
rest
to
us
i
beg
you
to
have
no
more
to
do
with
it
go
and
fetch
the
things
you
have
left
behind
you
don
t
say
a
word
of
all
this
practise
absolute
discretion
tell
the
baron
de
bourlac
to
address
himself
to
me
by
that
time
we
shall
have
decided
how
to
act
under
the
godefroid
left
him
took
a
cab
and
went
back
as
fast
as
he
could
to
the
boulevard
du
filled
with
horror
as
he
remembered
that
indictment
signed
with
bourlac
s
name
the
bloody
drama
ending
on
the
scaffold
and
madame
de
la
chanterie
s
imprisonment
at
bicetre
he
understood
now
the
abandonment
in
which
this
former
another
in
the
public
mind
was
ending
his
days
and
the
true
reasons
for
the
concealment
of
his
name
may
monsieur
joseph
avenge
her
terribly
he
thought
as
he
uttered
the
wish
in
his
own
mind
he
saw
auguste
what
do
you
want
of
me
he
asked
my
good
friend
such
a
dreadful
misfortune
has
overtaken
us
that
i
am
almost
mad
wretches
have
come
here
and
seized
all
my
mother
s
property
and
they
are
going
to
put
my
grandfather
in
prison
but
it
is
not
on
account
of
those
misfortunes
that
i
come
to
implore
you
said
the
lad
with
roman
pride
it
is
to
ask
you
to
do
me
a
service
such
as
people
do
to
those
who
are
condemned
to
go
on
what
is
it
said
godefroid
they
came
here
to
seize
my
grandfather
s
manuscript
and
as
i
think
he
gave
you
the
book
itself
i
want
you
to
take
the
notes
for
madame
vauthier
will
not
let
me
carry
anything
out
of
the
house
put
them
with
the
volumes
and
yes
yes
said
godefroid
go
and
get
them
at
while
the
lad
went
back
to
his
own
rooms
returning
immediately
godefroid
reflected
that
the
poor
child
was
guilty
of
no
crime
and
that
he
ought
not
to
put
despair
into
that
young
heart
by
speaking
of
his
grandfather
and
of
the
punishment
for
his
savage
political
actions
that
had
overtaken
his
old
age
he
therefore
took
the
little
package
with
a
good
grace
what
is
your
mother
s
name
he
asked
my
mother
is
the
baronne
de
mergi
my
father
was
the
son
of
the
president
of
the
royal
court
at
ah
said
godefroid
then
your
grandfather
married
his
daughter
to
the
son
of
the
famous
president
yes
now
my
little
friend
leave
me
said
godefroid
he
went
with
young
mergi
to
the
landing
and
called
to
madame
vauthier
mere
vauthier
he
said
you
can
let
my
rooms
i
shall
not
come
back
any
he
gathered
his
things
together
went
downstairs
and
got
into
the
cab
have
you
given
anything
to
that
gentleman
said
the
vauthier
to
auguste
yes
said
the
young
man
you
re
a
pretty
fellow
that
s
the
agent
of
your
grandfather
s
enemies
he
managed
this
whole
business
and
the
proof
is
that
now
that
the
trick
is
played
he
goes
off
and
isn
t
coming
back
any
more
he
has
just
told
me
i
can
let
his
auguste
flew
to
the
boulevard
and
ran
after
the
cab
shouting
so
loudly
that
he
finally
stopped
it
what
do
you
want
asked
godefroid
my
grandfather
s
tell
them
he
can
get
them
from
monsieur
the
youth
thought
the
words
were
intended
as
a
cruel
joke
he
sat
down
in
the
snow
as
he
saw
the
cab
disappearing
rapidly
presently
he
sprang
up
with
momentary
vigor
returned
to
his
room
and
went
to
bed
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
distress
the
next
morning
when
the
poor
boy
woke
alone
in
that
apartment
so
lately
occupied
by
his
mother
and
grandfather
the
painful
emotions
of
his
cruel
position
filled
his
mind
the
solitude
of
his
home
where
up
to
this
time
every
moment
had
had
its
duty
and
its
occupation
seemed
so
hard
to
bear
that
he
went
down
to
madame
vauthier
to
ask
if
she
had
received
any
news
of
his
grandfather
the
woman
answered
sneeringly
that
he
knew
very
well
or
he
might
know
where
to
find
his
grandfather
the
reason
why
he
had
not
come
in
she
said
was
because
he
had
gone
to
live
at
the
chateau
de
clichy
this
malicious
speech
from
the
woman
who
had
coaxed
and
wheedled
him
the
evening
before
put
the
lad
into
another
frenzy
and
he
rushed
to
the
hospital
once
more
desperate
with
the
idea
that
his
grandfather
was
in
prison
baron
bourlac
had
wandered
all
night
round
the
hospital
where
he
was
refused
entrance
and
round
the
private
residence
of
halpersohn
from
whom
he
wished
naturally
to
obtain
an
explanation
of
such
treatment
the
doctor
did
not
get
home
till
two
in
the
morning
at
one
the
old
man
was
at
his
door
on
being
told
he
was
absent
he
turned
and
walked
about
the
grand
alley
of
the
champs
elysees
until
two
when
he
again
went
to
the
house
the
porter
told
him
that
monsieur
halpersohn
had
returned
gone
to
bed
was
asleep
and
could
not
be
disturbed
the
poor
father
in
despair
wandered
along
the
quay
and
under
the
trees
of
the
waiting
for
daylight
at
nine
o
clock
in
the
morning
he
again
presented
himself
at
the
doctor
s
house
demanding
to
know
the
reason
why
his
daughter
was
thus
virtually
imprisoned
monsieur
replied
the
doctor
to
whose
presence
he
was
admitted
yesterday
i
told
you
i
would
answer
for
your
daughter
s
recovery
but
i
am
responsible
for
her
life
and
you
will
readily
understand
that
i
must
be
the
sovereign
master
in
such
a
case
yesterday
your
daughter
took
a
medicine
intended
to
bring
out
her
disease
the
until
that
horrible
disease
shows
itself
on
the
surface
you
can
not
see
her
i
will
not
allow
excitement
or
any
mistake
of
management
to
carry
off
my
patient
and
your
daughter
if
you
positively
insist
on
seeing
her
i
shall
call
a
consultation
of
three
physicians
so
as
to
relieve
myself
of
responsibility
for
the
patient
may
die
of
the
old
man
worn
out
with
fatigue
dropped
on
a
chair
but
he
rose
immediately
saying
forgive
me
monsieur
i
have
spent
the
night
waiting
for
you
in
dreadful
distress
of
mind
you
can
not
know
to
what
degree
i
love
my
daughter
i
have
nursed
her
for
fifteen
years
hovering
between
life
and
death
and
this
week
of
waiting
is
torture
to
the
baron
left
the
room
staggering
like
a
drunken
man
the
doctor
followed
and
supported
him
by
the
arm
until
he
saw
him
safely
down
the
staircase
an
hour
later
auguste
de
mergi
entered
the
doctor
s
room
on
questioning
the
porter
at
the
hospital
the
unhappy
lad
heard
that
his
grandfather
had
been
refused
an
entrance
and
had
gone
away
to
find
monsieur
halpersohn
who
could
probably
give
information
about
him
as
auguste
entered
the
doctor
s
study
halpersohn
was
breakfasting
on
a
cup
of
chocolate
and
a
glass
of
water
he
did
not
disturb
himself
at
the
young
man
s
entrance
but
went
on
sopping
his
bread
in
the
chocolate
for
he
never
ate
anything
for
breakfast
but
a
small
roll
cut
into
four
strips
with
careful
precision
well
young
man
he
said
glancing
at
vanda
s
son
so
you
have
come
too
to
find
out
about
your
mother
yes
monsieur
replied
auguste
de
mergi
auguste
was
standing
near
the
table
on
which
lay
several
among
a
pile
of
gold
louis
under
the
circumstances
in
which
the
unhappy
boy
was
placed
the
temptation
was
stronger
than
his
principles
solid
as
they
were
he
saw
a
means
of
saving
his
grandfather
and
the
fruits
of
almost
a
lifetime
of
toil
he
yielded
the
fascination
was
rapid
as
thought
and
it
was
justified
to
the
child
s
mind
by
the
idea
of
i
destroy
myself
but
i
save
my
mother
and
my
grandfather
he
thought
under
the
strain
put
upon
his
reason
by
this
criminal
temptation
he
acquired
like
madmen
a
singular
and
momentary
dexterity
halpersohn
an
experienced
observer
had
divined
retrospectively
the
life
of
the
old
man
and
that
of
the
lad
and
of
the
mother
he
felt
or
perceived
the
truth
the
baronne
de
mergi
s
remarks
had
helped
to
unveil
it
to
him
and
the
result
was
a
feeling
of
benevolent
pity
for
his
new
clients
as
for
respect
or
admiration
he
was
incapable
of
those
emotions
well
my
dear
boy
he
replied
familiarly
i
am
taking
care
of
your
mother
and
i
shall
return
her
to
you
young
and
handsome
and
perfectly
well
in
health
here
is
one
of
those
rare
cases
in
which
physicians
take
an
interest
besides
through
her
mother
she
is
a
compatriot
of
mine
you
and
your
grandfather
must
for
two
weeks
have
the
courage
to
keep
away
from
madame
the
baronne
de
ah
if
she
is
a
baroness
you
must
be
a
baron
remarked
halpersohn
at
that
instant
the
theft
was
accomplished
while
the
doctor
was
looking
at
his
sopped
bread
heavy
with
chocolate
auguste
snatched
four
notes
and
put
them
into
his
pocket
as
if
he
were
merely
putting
his
hand
there
by
accident
yes
monsieur
he
replied
i
am
a
baron
and
so
is
my
grandfather
he
was
under
the
you
blush
young
man
there
s
no
need
to
blush
for
being
a
poor
baron
that
s
common
who
told
you
monsieur
that
we
are
poor
your
grandfather
told
me
he
had
spent
the
night
in
the
champs
elysees
and
though
i
know
no
palace
with
half
so
fine
a
ceiling
as
that
of
the
skies
at
two
o
clock
this
morning
i
assure
you
it
was
pretty
cold
in
the
palace
where
your
grandfather
passed
the
night
we
don
t
select
the
star
inn
from
has
my
grandfather
been
here
this
morning
said
auguste
seizing
the
opportunity
to
get
away
i
thank
you
monsieur
and
i
will
call
again
if
you
will
permit
me
to
ask
for
news
of
my
as
soon
as
he
was
in
the
street
the
young
baron
took
a
cab
to
go
as
rapidly
as
he
could
to
the
sheriff
s
office
where
he
paid
his
grandfather
s
debt
the
sheriff
gave
him
the
papers
and
a
receipted
bill
of
costs
and
told
one
of
his
clerks
to
accompany
the
young
man
home
and
relieve
the
legal
guardian
of
her
functions
as
messieurs
barbet
and
metivier
live
in
your
quarter
he
said
i
will
tell
my
young
man
to
carry
the
money
there
and
obtain
the
bill
of
sale
of
the
books
and
return
it
to
auguste
who
did
not
understand
either
the
terms
or
the
formalities
of
the
law
did
exactly
as
he
was
told
he
received
seven
hundred
francs
change
from
the
four
thousand
francs
he
had
stolen
and
went
away
with
the
clerk
he
got
back
into
the
cab
in
a
condition
of
for
the
result
being
now
obtained
remorse
began
he
saw
himself
dishonored
cursed
by
his
grandfather
whose
inflexible
nature
was
to
him
and
he
felt
that
his
mother
would
surely
die
if
she
knew
him
guilty
all
nature
changed
for
him
he
was
hot
he
did
not
see
the
snow
the
houses
looked
like
spectres
flitting
past
him
by
the
time
he
reached
home
the
young
baron
had
decided
on
his
course
which
was
certainly
that
of
an
honest
man
he
went
to
his
mother
s
room
took
the
gold
set
with
diamonds
given
to
his
grandfather
by
the
emperor
and
wrapped
it
in
a
parcel
with
the
seven
hundred
francs
and
the
following
letter
which
required
several
rough
copies
before
it
was
satisfactory
then
he
directed
the
whole
to
doctor
halpersohn
monsieur
the
fruits
of
twenty
years
of
my
grandfather
s
toil
were
about
to
be
seized
by
usurers
who
even
threatened
to
put
him
in
prison
three
thousand
three
hundred
francs
were
enough
to
save
him
seeing
all
that
money
on
your
table
i
could
not
resist
the
happiness
of
freeing
my
grandfather
from
his
danger
i
borrowed
without
your
consent
four
thousand
francs
of
you
but
as
three
thousand
three
hundred
were
all
that
was
necessary
i
send
the
other
seven
hundred
in
money
together
with
a
gold
set
with
diamonds
given
to
my
grandfather
by
the
emperor
the
value
of
which
will
probably
cover
the
whole
sum
in
case
you
do
not
believe
in
the
honor
of
him
who
will
forever
regard
you
as
a
benefactor
i
pray
you
to
keep
silence
about
an
act
which
would
be
quite
unjustifiable
under
other
circumstances
for
by
so
doing
you
will
save
my
grandfather
s
life
just
as
you
are
saving
my
mother
s
life
and
i
shall
be
forever
your
devoted
servant
auguste
de
mergi
about
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
auguste
who
went
himself
as
far
as
the
champs
elysees
sent
the
package
from
there
by
a
street
messenger
to
doctor
halpersohn
s
house
then
he
walked
slowly
homeward
by
the
pont
de
jena
the
invalides
and
the
boulevards
relying
on
halpersohn
s
generosity
the
polish
doctor
had
meanwhile
discovered
the
theft
and
he
instantly
changed
his
opinion
of
his
clients
he
now
thought
the
old
man
had
come
to
rob
him
and
being
unable
to
succeed
had
sent
the
boy
he
doubted
the
rank
they
had
claimed
and
went
straight
to
the
where
he
lodged
a
complaint
requesting
that
the
lad
might
be
arrested
at
once
the
prudence
with
which
the
law
proceeds
seldom
allows
it
to
move
as
rapidly
as
complainants
desire
but
about
three
o
clock
of
that
day
a
commissary
of
police
accompanied
by
agents
who
kept
watch
outside
the
house
was
questioning
madame
vauthier
as
to
her
lodgers
and
the
widow
was
increasing
without
being
aware
of
it
the
suspicions
of
the
policeman
when
nepomucene
saw
the
police
agents
stationed
outside
the
house
he
thought
they
had
come
to
arrest
the
old
man
and
as
he
was
fond
of
monsieur
auguste
he
rushed
to
meet
monsieur
bernard
whom
he
now
saw
on
his
way
home
in
the
avenue
de
l
observatoire
hide
yourself
monsieur
he
cried
the
police
have
come
to
arrest
you
the
sheriff
was
here
yesterday
and
seized
everything
madame
vauthier
didn
t
give
you
the
stamped
papers
and
she
says
you
ll
be
in
clichy
or
there
don
t
you
see
those
policemen
baron
bourlac
immediately
resolved
to
go
straight
to
barbet
the
former
publisher
lived
in
the
rue
d
enfer
and
it
took
him
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
reach
the
house
ah
i
suppose
you
have
come
to
get
that
bill
of
sale
said
barbet
replying
to
the
salutation
of
his
victim
here
it
and
to
baron
bourlac
s
great
astonishment
he
held
out
the
document
which
the
baron
took
saying
i
do
not
didn
t
you
pay
me
said
the
usurer
are
you
paid
yes
your
grandson
took
the
money
to
the
sheriff
this
then
it
is
true
you
made
a
seizure
at
my
house
yesterday
haven
t
you
been
home
for
two
days
asked
barbet
but
an
old
magistrate
ought
to
know
what
a
notification
of
arrest
hearing
that
remark
the
baron
bowed
coldly
to
barbet
and
returned
home
thinking
that
the
policemen
whom
nepomucene
had
pointed
out
must
have
come
for
the
two
impecunious
authors
on
the
upper
floor
he
walked
slowly
lost
in
vague
apprehensions
for
in
spite
of
the
explanation
he
gave
himself
nepomucene
s
words
came
back
and
seemed
to
him
more
and
more
obscure
and
inexplicable
was
it
possible
that
godefroid
had
betrayed
him
xix
vengeance
the
old
man
walked
mechanically
along
the
rue
des
champs
and
entered
the
house
by
the
little
door
which
he
noticed
was
open
there
he
came
suddenly
upon
nepomucene
oh
monsieur
come
quick
they
are
taking
monsieur
auguste
to
prison
they
arrested
him
on
the
boulevard
it
was
he
they
were
looking
for
they
have
examined
the
old
man
bounded
like
a
tiger
rushed
through
the
house
with
the
speed
of
an
arrow
and
reached
the
door
on
the
boulevard
in
time
to
see
his
grandson
getting
into
a
with
three
men
auguste
he
said
what
does
all
this
mean
the
poor
boy
burst
into
tears
and
fainted
away
monsieur
i
am
the
baron
bourlac
formerly
he
said
to
the
commissary
of
police
whose
scarf
now
attracted
his
eye
i
entreat
you
to
explain
all
monsieur
if
you
are
baron
bourlac
two
words
will
be
enough
i
have
just
examined
this
young
man
and
he
admits
what
the
robbery
of
four
thousand
francs
from
doctor
halpersohn
is
that
true
auguste
grandpapa
i
sent
him
as
security
your
diamond
i
did
it
to
save
you
from
going
to
unhappy
boy
what
have
you
done
the
diamonds
are
false
cried
the
baron
i
sold
the
real
ones
three
years
ago
the
commissary
of
police
and
his
agents
looked
at
each
other
that
look
full
of
many
things
was
intercepted
by
baron
bourlac
and
seemed
to
blast
him
monsieur
he
said
to
the
commissary
you
need
not
feel
uneasy
i
shall
go
myself
to
the
prefect
but
you
are
witness
to
the
fact
that
i
kept
my
grandson
ignorant
of
the
loss
of
the
diamonds
do
your
duty
but
i
implore
you
in
the
name
of
humanity
put
that
lad
in
a
cell
by
himself
i
will
go
to
the
prison
to
which
one
are
you
taking
him
are
you
really
baron
bourlac
asked
the
commissary
oh
monsieur
the
fact
is
that
the
municipal
judge
and
i
doubted
if
it
were
possible
that
you
and
your
grandson
could
be
guilty
we
thought
and
the
doctor
too
that
some
scoundrels
had
taken
your
he
took
the
baron
aside
and
added
did
you
go
to
see
doctor
halpersohn
this
morning
yes
your
grandson
went
there
half
an
hour
after
did
he
i
knew
nothing
of
that
i
have
just
returned
home
and
have
not
seen
my
grandson
for
two
the
writs
he
has
shown
me
and
the
examination
explain
everything
said
the
commissary
of
police
i
see
the
cause
of
the
crime
monsieur
i
ought
by
rights
to
arrest
you
as
accomplice
to
your
grandson
for
your
answers
confirm
the
allegations
in
doctor
halpersohn
s
complaint
but
these
papers
which
i
here
return
to
you
holding
out
to
the
old
man
a
bundle
of
papers
do
prove
you
to
be
baron
bourlac
nevertheless
you
must
hold
yourself
ready
to
appear
before
monsieur
marest
the
judge
of
the
municipal
court
who
has
cognizance
of
the
case
as
for
your
grandson
i
will
speak
to
the
du
and
we
will
take
all
the
care
of
him
that
is
due
to
the
grandson
of
a
former
judge
the
victim
no
doubt
of
youthful
error
but
the
complaint
has
been
made
the
delinquent
admits
his
guilt
i
have
drawn
up
the
and
served
the
warrant
of
arrest
i
can
not
go
back
on
that
as
for
the
incarceration
i
will
put
him
in
the
thank
you
monsieur
said
the
unhappy
bourlac
with
the
words
he
fell
rigid
on
the
snow
and
rolled
into
one
of
the
hollows
round
the
trees
of
the
boulevard
the
commissary
of
police
called
for
help
and
nepomucene
ran
up
together
with
madame
vauthier
the
old
man
was
carried
to
his
room
and
madame
vauthier
begged
the
commissary
to
call
on
his
way
in
the
rue
d
enfer
and
send
doctor
berton
as
soon
as
possible
what
is
the
matter
with
my
grandfather
asked
poor
auguste
he
is
out
of
his
head
you
see
what
it
is
to
steal
said
the
vauthier
auguste
made
a
movement
as
though
he
would
dash
out
his
brains
the
two
agents
caught
him
come
young
man
be
calm
said
the
commissary
of
police
you
have
done
wrong
but
it
may
not
be
irreparable
monsieur
will
you
tell
that
woman
my
grandfather
hasn
t
had
anything
to
ear
for
hours
oh
the
poor
things
exclaimed
the
commissary
under
his
breath
he
stopped
the
coach
which
had
started
and
said
a
word
in
the
ear
of
one
of
his
agents
who
got
out
and
ran
to
madame
vauthier
and
then
returned
when
berton
arrived
he
declared
that
monsieur
bernard
he
knew
him
only
under
that
name
had
a
high
fever
of
great
intensity
after
hearing
from
madame
vauthier
all
the
events
which
had
brought
on
this
crisis
related
after
the
manner
of
such
women
he
informed
monsieur
alain
the
next
morning
at
du
of
the
present
state
of
affairs
on
which
monsieur
alain
despatched
a
note
in
pencil
by
a
street
messenger
to
monsieur
joseph
godefroid
had
given
monsieur
joseph
on
his
return
from
the
boulevard
du
the
night
before
the
notes
confided
to
him
by
auguste
and
monsieur
joseph
had
spent
part
of
the
night
in
reading
the
first
volume
of
baron
bourlac
s
work
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
madame
de
la
chanterie
told
her
neophyte
that
he
should
if
his
resolution
still
held
good
be
put
to
work
at
once
godefroid
initiated
by
her
into
the
financial
secrets
of
the
society
worked
steadily
seven
or
eight
hours
a
day
for
several
months
under
the
inspection
of
frederic
mongenod
who
came
every
sunday
to
examine
the
work
and
from
whom
he
received
much
praise
and
encouragement
you
are
he
said
when
the
books
were
all
in
order
and
the
accounts
audited
a
precious
acquisition
to
the
saints
among
whom
you
live
two
or
three
hours
a
day
will
now
suffice
to
keep
the
current
accounts
in
order
and
you
will
have
plenty
of
surplus
time
to
help
the
work
in
other
ways
if
you
still
have
the
vocation
you
showed
for
it
six
months
it
was
now
july
during
the
time
that
had
elapsed
since
his
opening
attempt
on
the
boulevard
du
godefroid
eager
to
prove
himself
worthy
of
his
friends
had
refrained
from
asking
any
question
relating
to
baron
bourlac
not
hearing
a
single
word
on
the
subject
and
finding
no
record
of
any
transaction
concerning
it
in
the
accounts
he
regarded
the
silence
maintained
about
the
enemy
of
madame
de
la
chanterie
and
his
family
either
as
a
test
to
which
he
himself
was
subjected
or
as
a
proof
that
the
friends
of
the
noble
woman
had
in
some
way
avenged
her
some
two
months
after
he
had
left
madame
vauthier
s
lodgings
he
turned
his
steps
when
out
for
a
walk
towards
the
boulevard
du
where
he
came
upon
the
widow
herself
and
asked
for
news
of
the
bernard
family
just
as
if
i
knew
what
has
become
of
them
she
replied
two
days
after
your
departure
for
it
was
you
slyboots
who
got
the
affair
away
from
my
proprietor
some
men
came
here
and
rid
me
of
that
arrogant
old
fool
and
all
his
belongings
bless
me
if
they
didn
t
move
everything
out
within
hours
and
as
close
as
wax
they
were
too
not
a
word
would
they
say
to
me
i
think
he
went
off
to
algiers
with
his
rogue
of
a
grandson
for
nepomucene
who
had
a
fancy
for
that
young
thief
being
no
better
himself
couldn
t
find
him
at
the
conciergerie
i
dare
say
nepomucene
knows
where
he
is
though
for
he
too
has
run
away
that
s
what
it
is
to
bring
up
foundlings
that
s
how
they
reward
you
for
all
your
trouble
leaving
you
in
the
lurch
i
haven
t
yet
been
able
to
get
a
man
in
his
place
and
as
the
quarter
is
looking
up
the
house
is
full
and
i
am
worked
to
godefroid
would
never
have
known
more
about
baron
bourlac
and
his
family
if
it
had
not
been
for
one
of
those
chance
encounters
such
as
often
happens
in
paris
in
the
month
of
september
he
was
walking
down
the
great
avenue
of
the
champs
elysees
thinking
as
he
passed
the
end
of
the
rue
marbeuf
of
halpersohn
i
might
thought
he
go
and
see
him
and
ask
if
he
ever
cured
bourlac
s
daughter
what
a
voice
what
immense
talents
she
had
and
she
wanted
to
consecrate
herself
to
god
when
he
reached
the
godefroid
crossed
it
quickly
on
account
of
the
many
carriages
that
were
passing
rapidly
as
he
reached
the
other
side
in
haste
he
knocked
against
a
young
man
with
a
lady
on
his
arm
take
care
said
the
young
man
are
you
blind
hey
is
it
you
cried
godefroid
recognizing
auguste
de
mergi
auguste
was
so
and
looked
so
dandified
and
handsome
and
so
proud
of
giving
his
arm
to
a
pretty
woman
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
youth
s
voice
and
the
memories
that
were
just
then
in
his
own
mind
he
might
not
have
recognized
him
oh
it
is
our
dear
monsieur
godefroid
said
the
lady
hearing
those
words
in
the
celestial
notes
of
vanda
s
enchanting
voice
godefroid
stopped
short
on
the
spot
where
he
stood
cured
he
exclaimed
for
the
last
ten
days
he
has
allowed
me
to
walk
out
she
replied
who
halpersohn
yes
she
said
why
have
you
not
been
to
see
us
perhaps
it
was
well
you
didn
t
she
added
my
hair
came
off
this
that
you
see
is
a
wig
but
the
doctor
assures
me
it
will
grow
again
oh
how
many
things
we
have
to
tell
each
other
come
and
dine
with
us
oh
your
accordion
oh
monsieur
she
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
i
shall
keep
it
all
my
life
she
went
on
and
my
son
will
preserve
it
as
a
relic
after
me
my
father
has
searched
all
paris
for
you
and
he
is
also
in
search
of
his
unknown
benefactors
he
will
grieve
himself
to
death
if
you
do
not
help
him
to
discover
them
poor
father
he
is
gnawed
by
a
melancholy
i
can
not
always
get
the
better
as
much
attracted
by
that
exquisite
voice
now
rescued
from
the
silence
of
the
grave
as
by
a
burning
curiosity
godefroid
offered
his
arm
to
the
hand
held
out
to
him
by
the
baronne
de
mergi
who
signed
to
her
son
to
precede
them
charging
him
with
a
commission
which
he
seemed
to
understand
i
shall
not
take
you
far
she
said

antin

a
pretty
little

him
halpersohn
adores
him
but
my
father
is
implacable
what
affair
asked
godefroid
ah
i
recognize
your
generosity
cried
vanda
what
a
heart
you
have
your
mother
must
be
proud
of
she
stopped
as
if
a
pain
had
struck
her
heart
i
swear
to
you
that
i
know
nothing
of
the
affair
of
which
you
speak
said
godefroid
it
is
possible
that
you
really
did
not
know
it
said
vanda
and
she
related
naively
in
terms
of
admiration
for
her
son
the
story
of
the
loan
that
he
had
secured
from
the
doctor
we
may
not
speak
of
it
before
baron
bourlac
said
godefroid
tell
me
now
how
your
son
got
out
of
his
well
said
vanda
i
told
you
i
think
that
he
is
now
employed
by
the
who
shows
him
the
greatest
kindness
auguste
was
only
hours
in
the
conciergerie
where
he
was
put
into
the
governor
s
house
the
good
doctor
who
did
not
receive
a
noble
letter
the
boy
wrote
him
till
late
at
night
withdrew
his
complaint
and
through
the
influence
of
a
former
judge
of
the
royal
courts
whom
my
father
has
never
been
able
to
meet
the
was
induced
to
annul
the
proceedings
in
the
court
there
is
no
trace
left
of
the
affair
except
in
my
heart
and
my
son
s
conscience
and
alas
in
his
grandfather
s
mind
from
that
day
he
has
treated
auguste
as
almost
a
stranger
only
yesterday
halpersohn
begged
him
to
forgive
the
boy
but
my
father
who
never
before
refused
me
anything
me
whom
he
loves
so
well
replied
you
are
the
person
robbed
you
can
and
you
ought
to
forgive
but
i
am
responsible
for
the
thief
when
i
was
i
never
you
ll
kill
your
daughter
said
halpersohn
my
father
made
no
reply
and
turned
but
who
helped
you
in
all
this
a
gentleman
whom
we
think
is
employed
to
do
the
queen
s
what
is
he
like
well
he
is
of
medium
height
rather
stout
but
active
with
a
kindly
genial
face
it
was
he
who
found
my
father
ill
of
fever
in
the
house
where
you
knew
us
and
had
him
brought
to
that
in
which
we
now
live
and
just
fancy
as
soon
as
my
father
recovered
was
installed
there
too
in
my
very
own
room
just
as
if
i
had
never
left
it
halpersohn
whom
the
gentleman
captivated
i
am
sure
i
don
t
know
how
then
told
me
all
the
sufferings
my
father
had
endured
ah
when
i
think
of
it
my
father
and
my
son
often
without
bread
to
eat
and
when
with
me
pretending
to
be
rich
even
the
diamonds
in
the
snuff
box
sold
oh
monsieur
godefroid
those
two
beings
are
martyrs
and
so
what
can
i
say
to
my
father
between
him
and
my
son
i
can
take
no
part
i
can
only
make
return
to
them
in
kind
by
suffering
with
them
as
they
once
suffered
with
and
you
say
you
think
that
gentleman
came
from
the
queen
oh
i
am
sure
you
know
him
i
see
it
in
your
face
cried
vanda
now
at
the
door
of
the
house
she
seized
godefroid
by
the
hand
with
the
vigor
of
a
nervous
woman
and
dragged
him
into
a
salon
the
door
of
which
stood
open
papa
she
cried
here
is
monsieur
godefroid
and
i
am
certain
he
knows
our
baron
bourlac
whom
godefroid
now
saw
dressed
in
a
manner
suitable
for
a
man
of
his
rank
and
position
rose
and
came
forward
holding
out
his
hand
to
godefroid
saying
as
he
did
so
i
was
sure
of
godefroid
made
a
gesture
denying
that
he
shared
in
this
noble
vengeance
but
the
former
gave
him
no
chance
to
speak
ah
monsieur
he
said
continuing
providence
could
not
be
more
powerful
love
more
ingenious
motherhood
more
than
your
friends
have
been
for
us
i
bless
the
chance
that
has
brought
you
here
for
monsieur
joseph
has
disappeared
forever
he
has
evaded
all
the
traps
i
set
to
discover
his
true
name
and
residence
here
read
his
last
letter
but
perhaps
you
already
know
godefroid
read
as
follows
monsieur
le
baron
bourlac
the
sums
which
we
have
spent
for
you
under
the
orders
of
a
charitable
lady
amount
to
fifteen
thousand
francs
take
note
of
this
so
that
you
may
return
that
sum
either
yourself
or
through
your
descendants
whenever
the
prosperity
of
your
family
will
admit
of
it
for
that
money
is
the
money
of
the
poor
when
you
or
your
family
are
able
to
make
this
restitution
pay
the
sum
you
owe
into
the
hands
of
mongenod
and
company
bankers
may
god
forgive
you
five
crosses
formed
the
mysterious
signature
of
this
letter
which
godefroid
returned
to
the
baron
the
five
crosses
are
there
he
said
as
if
to
himself
ah
monsieur
said
the
old
man
you
do
know
all
you
were
sent
to
me
by
that
mysterious
lady
tell
me
her
name
her
name
exclaimed
godefroid
her
name
unhappy
man
you
must
not
ask
it
never
seek
to
find
it
out
ah
madame
he
cried
taking
madame
de
mergi
s
hand
tell
your
father
if
he
values
his
peace
of
mind
to
remain
in
his
ignorance
and
make
no
effort
to
discover
the
no
tell
it
said
vanda
well
then
she
who
saved
your
daughter
said
godefroid
looking
at
the
old
man
who
returns
her
to
you
young
and
beautiful
and
fresh
and
happy
who
rescued
her
from
her
coffin
she
who
saved
your
grandson
from
disgrace
and
has
given
you
an
old
age
of
peace
and
honor
he
stopped
short
is
a
woman
whom
you
sent
innocent
to
prison
for
twenty
years
to
whom
as
a
magistrate
you
did
the
foulest
wrong
whose
sanctity
you
insulted
whose
beautiful
daughter
you
tore
from
her
arms
and
condemned
to
the
cruellest
of
all
deaths
for
she
died
on
the
godefroid
seeing
that
vanda
had
fallen
back
half
fainting
on
her
chair
rushed
into
the
corridor
and
from
there
into
the
street
running
at
full
speed
if
you
want
your
pardon
said
baron
bourlac
to
his
grandson
follow
that
man
and
find
out
where
he
auguste
was
off
like
an
arrow
the
next
morning
at
eight
o
clock
baron
bourlac
knocked
at
the
old
yellow
door
in
the
rue
chanoinesse
and
asked
for
madame
de
la
chanterie
the
portress
showed
him
the
portico
happily
it
was
the
breakfast
hour
godefroid
saw
the
baron
through
one
of
the
casements
on
the
stairs
crossing
the
he
had
just
time
to
get
down
into
the
salon
where
the
friends
were
all
assembled
and
to
cry
out
baron
bourlac
is
here
madame
de
la
chanterie

the
name
rose
supported
by
the
abbe
de
veze
she
went
to
her
room
you
shall
not
come
in
tool
of
satan
cried
manon
recognizing
their
former
prosecutor
and
preventing
his
entrance
through
the
door
of
the
salon
have
you
come
to
kill
madame
manon
let
the
gentleman
come
in
said
monsieur
alain
manon
sat
down
on
a
chair
as
if
both
her
legs
had
given
way
at
once
monsieur
said
the
baron
in
an
agitated
voice
recognizing
monsieur
joseph
and
godefroid
and
bowing
to
monsieur
nicolas
mercy
gives
rights
to
those
it
you
owe
us
nothing
monsieur
said
the
good
old
alain
you
owe
everything
to
you
are
saints
and
you
have
the
calmness
of
saints
said
the
former
magistrate
you
will
therefore
listen
to
me
i
know
that
the
vast
benefits
i
have
received
during
the
last
eighteen
months
have
come
from
the
hand
of
a
person
whom
i
grievously
injured
in
doing
my
duty
it
was
fifteen
years
before
i
was
convinced
of
her
innocence
and
that
case
is
the
only
one
gentlemen
for
which
i
feel
any
remorse
as
to
the
exercise
of
my
functions
listen
to
me
i
have
but
a
short
time
to
live
but
i
shall
lose
even
that
poor
remnant
of
a
life
still
so
important
to
my
children
whom
madame
de
la
chanterie
has
saved
unless
she
will
also
grant
me
her
pardon
yes
i
will
stay
there
on
my
knees
on
the
pavement
of
until
she
says
to
me
that
word
i
who
can
not
weep
whom
the
tortures
of
my
child
have
dried
like
stubble

shall
find
tears
within
me

of
madame
de
la
chanterie
s
room
opened
the
abbe
de
veze
glided
in
like
a
shadow
and
said
to
monsieur
joseph
that
voice
is
torturing
ah
she
is
there
exclaimed
the
baron
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
burst
into
tears
crying
out
in
a
voice
in
the
name
of
jesus
dying
on
the
cross
forgive
forgive
me
for
my
daughter
has
suffered
a
thousand
deaths
the
old
man
fell
forward
on
the
floor
so
prone
that
the
agitated
spectators
thought
him
dead
at
that
instant
madame
de
la
chanterie
appeared
like
a
spectre
at
the
door
of
her
room
against
the
frame
of
which
she
supported
herself
in
the
name
of
louis
xvi
and
whom
i
see
on
their
scaffold
in
the
name
of
madame
elisabeth
in
the
name
of
my
daughter
and
of
yours
and
for
jesus
sake

him
