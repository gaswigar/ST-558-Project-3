it
one
thing
to
laugh
at
a
man
because
his
job
is
useless
and
outdated
another
to
depend
on
him
when
it
suddenly
is
the
northland
deep
and
in
a
great
cave
by
an
everburning
fire
the
warrior
sleeps
for
this
is
the
resting
time
the
time
of
peace
and
so
shall
it
be
for
a
thousand
years
and
yet
we
shall
summon
him
again
my
children
when
we
are
sore
in
need
and
out
of
the
north
he
will
come
and
again
and
again
each
time
we
call
out
of
the
dark
and
the
cold
with
the
fire
in
his
hands
he
will
throughout
the
night
thick
clouds
had
been
piling
in
the
north
in
the
morning
it
was
misty
and
cold
by
eight
a
wet
heavy
breeze
had
begun
to
set
in
and
because
the
crops
were
all
down
and
the
winter
planting
done
the
colonists
brewed
hot
coffee
and
remained
inside
the
wind
blew
steadily
icily
from
the
north
it
was
well
below
freezing
when
some
time
after
nine
an
army
ship
landed
in
a
field
near
the
settlement
there
was
still
time
there
were
some
last
brief
moments
in
which
the
colonists
could
act
and
feel
as
they
had
always
done
they
therefore
grumbled
in
annoyance
they
wanted
no
soldiers
here
the
few
who
had
convenient
windows
stared
out
with
distaste
and
a
mild
curiosity
but
no
one
went
out
to
greet
them
after
a
while
a
rather
tall
man
came
out
of
the
ship
and
stood
upon
the
hard
ground
looking
toward
the
village
he
remained
there
waiting
stiffly
his
face
turned
from
the
wind
it
was
a
silly
thing
to
do
he
was
obviously
not
coming
in
either
out
of
pride
or
just
plain
orneriness
well
i
never
a
nice
lady
said
what
he
just
there
for
another
lady
said
and
all
of
them
thought
well
god
knows
what
in
the
mind
of
a
soldier
and
right
away
many
people
concluded
that
he
must
be
drunk
the
seed
of
peace
was
deeply
planted
in
these
people
in
the
children
and
the
women
very
very
deep
and
because
they
had
been
taught
oh
so
carefully
to
hate
war
they
had
also
been
taught
quite
incidentally
to
despise
soldiers
the
lone
man
kept
standing
in
the
freezing
wind
eventually
because
even
a
soldier
can
look
small
and
cold
and
pathetic
bob
rossel
had
to
get
up
out
of
a
nice
warm
bed
and
go
out
in
that
miserable
cold
to
meet
him
the
soldier
saluted
like
most
soldiers
he
was
not
too
neat
and
not
too
clean
and
the
salute
was
sloppy
although
he
was
bigger
than
rossel
he
did
not
seem
bigger
and
because
of
the
cold
there
were
tears
gathering
in
the
ends
of
his
eyes
captain
dylan
sir
his
voice
was
low
and
did
not
carry
i
have
a
message
from
fleet
headquarters
are
you
in
charge
here
rossel
a
small
sober
man
grunted
nobody
in
charge
here
if
you
want
a
spokesman
i
guess
i
do
what
up
the
captain
regarded
him
briefly
out
of
pale
blue
expressionless
eyes
then
he
pulled
an
envelope
from
an
inside
pocket
handed
it
to
rossel
it
was
a
thick
thing
and
rossel
hefted
it
idly
he
was
about
to
ask
again
what
was
it
all
about
when
the
airlock
of
the
hovering
ship
swung
open
creakily
a
beefy
young
man
appeared
unsteadily
in
the
doorway
called
to
dylan
i
go
now
jim
dylan
turned
and
nodded
be
back
for
you
tonight
the
young
man
called
and
then
grinning
he
yelled
catch
and
tossed
down
a
bottle
the
captain
caught
it
and
put
it
unconcernedly
into
his
pocket
while
rossel
stared
in
disgust
a
moment
later
the
airlock
closed
and
the
ship
prepared
to
lift
was
he
rossel
began
angrily
was
that
a
bottle
of
the
soldier
was
looking
at
him
calmly
coldly
he
indicated
the
envelope
in
rossel
hand
you
better
read
that
and
get
moving
we
have
much
time
he
turned
and
walked
toward
the
buildings
and
rossel
had
to
follow
as
rossel
drew
near
the
walls
the
watchers
could
see
his
lips
moving
but
could
not
hear
him
just
then
the
ship
lifted
and
they
turned
to
watch
that
and
followed
it
upward
red
into
the
gray
spongy
clouds
and
the
cold
after
a
while
the
ship
went
out
of
sight
and
nobody
ever
saw
it
again
the
first
contact
man
had
ever
had
with
an
intelligent
alien
race
occurred
out
on
the
perimeter
in
a
small
quiet
place
a
long
way
from
home
late
in
the
year
the
exact
date
remains
unknown
an
alien
force
attacked
and
destroyed
the
colony
at
lupus
the
wreckage
and
the
dead
were
found
by
a
mailship
which
flashed
off
screaming
for
the
army
when
the
army
came
it
found
this
of
the
seventy
registered
colonists
were
dead
the
rest
including
some
women
and
children
were
missing
all
technical
equipment
all
radios
guns
machines
even
books
were
also
missing
the
buildings
had
been
burned
so
were
the
bodies
apparently
the
aliens
had
a
heat
ray
what
else
they
had
nobody
knew
after
a
few
days
of
walking
around
in
the
ash
one
soldier
finally
stumbled
on
something
for
security
reasons
there
was
a
detonator
in
one
of
the
main
buildings
in
case
of
enemy
attack
security
had
provided
a
bomb
to
be
buried
in
the
center
of
each
colony
because
it
was
important
to
blow
a
whole
village
to
hell
and
gone
rather
than
let
a
hostile
alien
learn
vital
facts
about
human
technology
and
body
chemistry
there
was
a
bomb
at
lupus
v
too
and
though
it
had
been
detonated
it
had
not
blown
the
detonating
wire
had
been
cut
in
the
heart
of
the
camp
hidden
from
view
under
twelve
inches
of
earth
the
wire
had
been
dug
up
and
cut
the
army
could
not
understand
it
and
had
no
time
to
try
after
five
hundred
years
of
peace
and
conditioning
the
army
was
small
weak
and
without
respect
therefore
the
army
did
nothing
but
spread
the
news
and
man
began
to
fall
back
in
a
thickening
hastening
stream
he
came
back
from
the
stars
blowing
up
his
homes
behind
him
stunned
and
cursing
most
of
the
colonists
got
out
in
time
a
few
the
farthest
and
loneliest
died
in
fire
before
the
army
ships
could
reach
them
and
the
men
in
those
ships
drinkers
and
gamblers
and
veterans
of
nothing
the
dregs
of
a
society
which
had
grown
beyond
them
were
for
a
long
while
the
only
defense
earth
had
this
was
the
message
captain
dylan
had
brought
come
out
from
earth
with
a
bottle
on
his
hip
an
obscenely
cheerful
expression
upon
his
gaunt
not
too
well
shaven
face
captain
dylan
perched
himself
upon
the
edge
of
a
table
and
listened
one
long
booted
leg
swinging
idly
one
by
one
the
colonists
were
beginning
to
understand
war
is
huge
and
comes
with
great
suddenness
and
always
without
reason
and
there
is
inevitably
a
wait
between
acts
between
the
news
and
the
motion
the
fear
and
the
rage
dylan
waited
these
people
were
taking
it
well
much
better
than
those
in
the
cities
had
taken
it
but
then
these
were
pioneers
dylan
grinned
pioneers
before
you
settle
a
planet
you
boil
it
and
bake
it
and
purge
it
of
all
possible
disease
then
you
step
down
gingerly
and
inflate
your
plastic
houses
which
harden
and
become
warm
and
impregnable
and
send
your
machines
out
to
plant
and
harvest
and
set
up
automatic
factories
to
transmute
dirt
into
coffee
and
without
ever
having
lifted
a
finger
you
have
braved
the
wilderness
hewed
a
home
out
of
the
living
rock
and
become
a
pioneer
dylan
grinned
again
but
at
least
this
was
better
than
the
wailing
of
the
cities
this
dylan
thought
although
he
was
himself
no
fighter
no
man
at
all
by
any
standards
this
he
thought
because
he
was
a
soldier
and
an
outcast
to
every
drunken
man
the
fall
of
the
sober
is
a
happy
thing
he
stirred
restlessly
by
this
time
the
colonists
had
begun
to
realize
that
there
was
much
to
say
and
a
tall
handsome
woman
was
murmuring
distractedly
lupus
lupus
does
that
mean
wolves
or
something
dylan
began
to
wish
they
would
get
moving
these
pioneers
it
was
very
possible
that
the
aliens
would
be
here
soon
and
there
was
no
need
for
discussion
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
and
that
was
to
clear
the
hell
out
quickly
and
without
argument
they
began
to
see
it
but
when
the
fear
had
died
down
the
resentment
came
a
number
of
women
began
to
cluster
around
dylan
and
complain
working
up
their
anger
dylan
said
nothing
then
the
man
rossel
pushed
forward
and
confronted
him
speaking
with
a
vast
annoyance
see
here
soldier
this
is
our
planet
i
mean
to
say
this
is
our
we
demand
some
protection
from
the
fleet
by
god
we
been
paying
the
freight
for
you
boys
all
these
years
and
it
high
time
you
earned
your
keep
we
demand
it
went
on
and
on
while
dylan
looked
at
the
clock
and
waited
he
hoped
that
he
could
end
this
quickly
a
big
gloomy
man
was
in
front
of
him
now
and
giving
him
that
name
of
ancient
contempt
soldier
boy
the
gloomy
man
wanted
to
know
where
the
fleet
was
there
is
no
fleet
there
are
a
few
hundred
old
tubs
that
were
obsolete
before
you
were
born
there
are
four
or
five
new
jobs
for
the
brass
and
the
government
that
all
the
fleet
there
is
dylan
wanted
to
go
on
about
that
to
remind
them
that
nobody
had
wanted
the
army
that
the
fleet
had
grown
smaller
and
smaller
but
this
was
not
the
time
it
was
already
and
the
damned
aliens
might
be
coming
in
right
now
for
all
he
knew
and
all
they
did
was
talk
he
had
realized
a
long
time
ago
that
no
nation
in
the
history
of
earth
had
ever
kept
itself
strong
and
although
peace
was
a
noble
dream
it
was
ended
now
and
it
was
time
to
move
we
better
get
going
he
finally
said
and
there
was
quiet
lieutenant
bossio
has
gone
on
to
your
sister
colony
at
planet
three
of
this
system
he
return
to
pick
me
up
by
nightfall
and
i
instructed
to
have
you
gone
by
then
for
a
long
moment
they
waited
and
then
one
man
abruptly
walked
off
and
the
rest
followed
quickly
in
a
moment
they
were
all
gone
one
or
two
stopped
long
enough
to
complain
about
the
fleet
and
the
big
gloomy
man
said
he
wanted
guns
that
all
and
there
would
nobody
get
him
off
his
planet
when
he
left
dylan
breathed
with
relief
and
went
out
to
check
the
bomb
grateful
for
the
action
most
of
it
had
to
be
done
in
the
open
he
found
a
metal
bar
in
the
radio
shack
and
began
chopping
at
the
frozen
ground
following
the
wire
it
was
the
first
thing
he
had
done
with
his
hands
in
weeks
and
it
felt
fine
dylan
had
been
called
up
out
of
a
bar
he
and
bossio
and
told
what
had
happened
and
in
three
weeks
now
they
had
cleared
four
colonies
this
would
be
the
last
and
the
tension
here
was
beginning
to
get
to
him
after
thirty
years
of
hanging
around
and
playing
like
the
town
drunk
a
man
could
not
be
expected
to
rush
out
and
plug
the
breach
just
like
that
it
would
take
time
he
rested
sweating
took
a
pull
from
the
bottle
on
his
hip
before
they
sent
him
out
on
this
trip
they
had
made
him
a
captain
well
that
was
nice
after
thirty
years
he
was
a
captain
for
thirty
years
he
had
bummed
all
over
the
west
end
of
space
had
scraped
his
way
along
the
outer
edges
of
mankind
had
waited
and
dozed
and
patrolled
and
got
drunk
waiting
always
for
something
to
happen
there
were
a
lot
of
ways
to
pass
the
time
while
you
waited
for
something
to
happen
and
he
had
done
them
all
once
he
had
even
studied
military
tactics
he
could
not
help
smiling
at
that
even
now
damn
it
he
been
green
but
he
been
only
nineteen
when
his
father
died
of
a
hernia
of
a
crazy
fool
thing
like
a
hernia
that
killed
him
just
because
he
worked
too
long
on
a
heavy
planet
and
in
those
days
the
conditioning
out
on
the
rim
was
not
very
strong
they
talked
a
lot
about
guardians
of
the
frontier
and
they
got
him
and
some
other
kids
and
a
doctor
and
now
he
was
a
captain
he
bent
his
back
savagely
digging
at
the
ground
you
wait
and
you
wait
and
the
edge
goes
off
this
thing
he
had
waited
for
all
those
damn
days
was
upon
him
now
and
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
but
say
the
hell
with
it
and
go
home
somewhere
along
the
line
in
some
dark
corner
of
the
bars
or
the
jails
in
one
of
the
million
insults
which
are
reserved
especially
for
peacetime
soldiers
he
had
lost
the
core
of
himself
and
it
did
particularly
matter
that
was
the
point
it
made
no
particular
difference
if
he
never
got
it
back
he
owed
nobody
he
was
tugging
at
the
wire
and
trying
to
think
of
something
pleasant
from
the
old
days
when
the
wire
came
loose
in
his
hands
although
he
had
been
in
his
cynical
way
expecting
it
for
a
moment
it
threw
him
and
he
just
stared
the
end
was
clean
and
bright
the
wire
had
just
been
cut
dylan
sat
for
a
long
while
by
the
radio
shack
holding
the
ends
in
his
hands
he
reached
almost
automatically
for
the
bottle
on
his
hip
and
then
for
the
first
time
he
could
remember
let
it
go
this
was
real
there
was
no
time
for
that
when
rossel
came
up
dylan
was
still
sitting
rossel
was
so
excited
he
did
not
notice
the
wire
listen
soldier
how
many
people
can
your
ship
take
dylan
looked
at
him
vaguely
she
sleeps
two
and
wo
take
off
with
ten
why
his
eyes
bright
and
worried
rossel
leaned
heavily
against
the
shack
we
overloaded
there
are
sixty
of
us
and
our
ship
will
only
take
forty
we
came
out
in
groups
we
never
thought
dylan
dropped
his
eyes
swearing
silently
you
sure
no
baggage
no
iron
rations
you
could
get
ten
more
on
not
a
chance
she
only
a
little
ship
with
one
deck
she
all
we
could
afford
dylan
whistled
he
had
begun
to
feel
it
that
somebody
gon
na
find
out
first
hand
what
them
aliens
look
like
it
was
the
wrong
thing
to
say
and
he
knew
it
all
right
he
said
quickly
still
staring
at
the
wire
we
do
what
we
can
maybe
the
colony
on
three
has
room
i
call
bossio
and
ask
the
colonist
had
begun
to
look
quite
pitifully
at
the
buildings
around
him
and
the
scurrying
people
are
there
any
fleet
ships
within
radio
distance
dylan
shook
his
head
the
fleet
spread
out
kind
of
thin
nowadays
because
the
other
was
leaning
on
him
he
felt
a
great
irritation
but
he
said
as
kindly
as
he
could
we
get
all
out
one
way
or
another
we
wo
leave
anybody
it
was
then
that
rossel
saw
the
wire
thickly
he
asked
what
had
happened
dylan
showed
him
the
two
clean
ends
somebody
dug
it
up
cut
it
then
buried
it
again
and
packed
it
down
real
nice
the
damn
fool
rossel
exploded
who
why
one
of
of
us
of
course
i
know
nobody
ever
liked
sitting
on
a
live
bomb
like
this
but
i
never
you
think
one
of
your
people
did
it
rossel
stared
at
him
is
that
obvious
why
well
they
probably
thought
it
was
too
dangerous
and
silly
too
like
most
government
rules
or
maybe
one
of
the
kids
it
was
then
that
dylan
told
him
about
the
wire
on
lupus
rossel
was
silent
involuntarily
he
glanced
at
the
sky
then
he
said
shakily
maybe
an
animal
dylan
shook
his
head
no
animal
did
that
would
have
buried
it
or
found
it
in
the
first
place
heck
of
a
coincidence
do
you
think
the
wire
at
lupus
was
cut
just
before
an
alien
attack
and
now
this
one
is
cut
too
newly
cut
the
colonist
put
one
hand
to
his
mouth
his
eyes
wide
and
white
so
something
said
dylan
knew
enough
about
this
camp
to
know
that
a
bomb
was
buried
here
and
also
to
know
why
it
was
here
and
that
something
did
want
the
camp
destroyed
and
so
came
right
into
the
center
of
the
camp
traced
the
wire
dug
it
up
and
cut
it
and
then
walked
right
out
again
listen
said
rossel
i
better
go
ask
he
started
away
but
dylan
caught
his
arm
tell
them
to
arm
he
said
and
try
not
to
scare
hell
out
of
them
i
be
with
you
as
soon
as
i
spliced
this
wire
rossel
nodded
and
went
off
running
dylan
knelt
with
the
metal
in
his
hands
he
began
to
feel
that
by
god
he
was
getting
cold
he
realized
that
he
better
go
inside
soon
but
the
wire
had
to
be
spliced
that
was
perhaps
the
most
important
thing
he
could
do
now
splice
the
wire
all
right
he
asked
himself
for
the
thousandth
time
who
cut
it
how
telepathy
could
they
somehow
control
one
of
us
no
if
they
controlled
one
then
they
could
control
all
and
then
there
would
be
no
need
for
an
attack
but
you
do
know
you
do
really
know
were
they
small
little
animals
unlikely
biology
said
that
really
intelligent
life
required
a
sizable
brain
and
you
would
have
to
expect
an
alien
to
be
at
least
as
large
as
a
dog
and
every
form
of
life
on
this
planet
had
been
screened
long
before
a
colony
had
been
allowed
in
if
any
new
animals
had
suddenly
shown
up
rossel
would
certainly
know
about
it
he
would
ask
rossel
he
would
damn
sure
have
to
ask
rossel
he
finished
splicing
the
wire
and
tucked
it
into
the
ground
then
he
straightened
up
and
before
he
went
into
the
radio
shack
he
pulled
out
his
pistol
he
checked
it
primed
it
and
tried
to
remember
the
last
time
he
had
fired
it
he
never
had
he
never
had
fired
a
gun
the
snow
began
falling
near
noon
there
was
nothing
anybody
could
do
but
stand
in
the
silence
and
watch
it
come
down
in
a
white
rushing
wall
and
watch
the
trees
and
the
hills
drown
in
the
whiteness
until
there
was
nothing
on
the
planet
but
the
buildings
and
a
few
warm
lights
and
the
snow
by
one
the
visibility
was
down
to
zero
and
dylan
decided
to
try
to
contact
bossio
again
and
tell
him
to
hurry
but
bossio
still
did
answer
dylan
stared
long
and
thoughtfully
out
the
window
through
the
snow
at
the
gray
shrouded
shapes
of
bushes
and
trees
which
were
beginning
to
become
horrifying
it
must
be
that
bossio
was
still
drunk
maybe
sleeping
it
off
before
making
planetfall
on
three
dylan
held
no
grudge
bossio
was
a
kid
and
alone
it
took
a
special
kind
of
guts
to
take
a
ship
out
into
space
alone
when
things
could
be
waiting
a
young
girl
pink
and
lovely
in
a
thick
fur
jacket
came
into
the
shack
and
told
him
breathlessly
that
her
father
mr
rush
would
like
to
know
if
he
wanted
sentries
posted
dylan
had
thought
about
it
but
he
said
yes
right
away
beginning
to
feel
both
pleased
and
irritated
at
the
same
time
because
now
they
were
coming
to
him
he
pushed
out
into
the
cold
and
went
to
find
rossel
with
the
snow
it
was
bad
enough
but
if
they
were
still
here
when
the
sun
went
down
they
would
have
a
chance
most
of
the
men
were
out
stripping
down
their
ship
and
that
would
take
a
while
he
wondered
why
rossel
had
yet
put
a
call
through
to
three
asking
about
room
on
the
ship
there
the
only
answer
he
could
find
was
that
rossel
knew
that
there
was
no
room
and
he
wanted
to
put
off
the
answer
as
long
as
possible
and
in
a
way
you
could
not
blame
him
rossel
was
in
his
cabin
with
the
big
gloomy
man
who
turned
out
to
be
rush
the
one
who
had
asked
about
sentries
rush
was
methodically
cleaning
an
old
hunting
rifle
rossel
was
surprisingly
full
of
hope
listen
there
a
mail
ship
due
in
been
due
since
yesterday
we
might
get
the
rest
of
the
folks
out
on
that
dylan
shrugged
do
count
on
it
but
they
have
a
contract
the
soldier
grinned
the
big
man
rush
was
paying
no
attention
quite
suddenly
he
said
who
cut
that
wire
cap
dylan
swung
slowly
to
look
at
him
as
far
as
i
can
figure
an
alien
cut
it
rush
shook
his
head
no
ai
been
no
aliens
near
this
camp
and
no
peculiar
animals
either
we
got
a
radar
and
ai
no
unidentified
ships
come
near
not
since
we
first
landed
a
year
ago
he
lifted
the
rifle
and
peered
through
the
bore
one
of
us
did
it
the
man
had
been
thinking
and
he
knew
the
planet
telepathy
asked
dylan
might
be
ca
see
it
you
people
live
too
close
you
notice
right
away
if
one
of
you
was
himself
and
if
they
got
one
why
not
all
rush
calmly
at
least
outwardly
calmly
lit
his
pipe
there
was
a
strength
in
this
man
that
dylan
had
missed
before
do
know
he
said
gruffly
but
these
are
aliens
mister
and
until
i
know
different
i
keepin
an
eye
on
my
neighbor
he
gave
rossel
a
sour
look
and
rossel
stared
back
uncomprehending
then
rossel
jumped
my
god
dylan
moved
to
quiet
him
look
is
there
any
animal
at
all
that
ever
comes
near
here
that
as
large
as
a
dog
after
a
pause
rush
answered
yep
there
one
the
viggle
it
like
a
monkey
but
with
four
legs
biology
cleared
before
we
landed
we
shoot
one
now
and
then
when
they
get
pesky
he
rose
slowly
the
rifle
held
under
his
arm
i
we
might
just
as
well
go
post
them
sentries
dylan
wanted
to
go
on
with
this
but
there
was
nothing
much
else
to
say
rossel
went
with
them
as
far
as
the
radio
shack
with
a
strained
expression
on
his
face
to
put
through
that
call
to
three
when
he
was
gone
rush
asked
dylan
where
you
want
them
sentries
i
got
walt
halloran
and
web
eggers
and
six
others
lined
up
dylan
stopped
and
looked
around
grimly
at
the
circling
wall
of
snow
you
know
the
site
better
than
i
do
post
in
a
ring
on
rises
within
calling
distance
have
check
with
each
other
every
five
minutes
i
go
help
your
people
at
the
ship
the
gloomy
man
nodded
and
fluffed
up
his
collar
nice
day
for
huntin
he
said
and
then
he
was
gone
with
the
snow
quickly
covering
his
footprints
the
alien
lay
wrapped
in
a
thick
electric
cocoon
buried
in
a
wide
warm
room
beneath
the
base
of
a
tree
the
tree
served
him
as
antennae
curiously
he
gazed
into
a
small
and
watched
the
humans
come
he
saw
them
fan
out
eight
of
them
and
sink
down
in
the
snow
he
saw
that
they
were
armed
he
pulsed
thoughtfully
extending
a
part
of
himself
to
absorb
a
spiced
lizard
since
the
morning
when
the
new
ship
had
come
he
had
been
watching
steadily
and
now
it
was
apparent
that
the
humans
were
aware
of
their
danger
undoubtedly
they
were
preparing
to
leave
that
was
unfortunate
the
attack
was
not
scheduled
until
late
that
night
and
he
could
not
of
course
press
the
assault
by
day
but
he
reminded
himself
sternly
the
first
principle
of
and
therefore
he
moved
to
alter
his
plans
a
projection
reached
out
to
dial
several
knobs
on
a
large
box
before
him
and
the
hour
of
assault
was
moved
forward
to
dusk
a
glance
at
the
chronometer
told
him
that
it
was
already
well
into
the
night
on
planet
three
and
that
the
attack
there
had
probably
begun
the
alien
felt
the
first
tenuous
pulsing
of
anticipation
he
lay
quietly
watching
the
small
square
lights
of
windows
against
the
snow
thanking
the
unexplainable
that
matters
had
been
so
devised
that
he
would
not
have
to
venture
out
into
that
miserable
cold
presently
an
alarming
thought
struck
him
these
humans
moved
with
uncommon
speed
for
intelligent
creatures
even
without
devices
it
was
distinctly
possible
that
they
could
be
gone
before
nightfall
he
could
take
no
chance
of
course
he
spun
more
dials
and
pressed
a
single
button
and
lay
back
again
comfortably
warmly
to
watch
the
disabling
of
the
colonists
ship
when
three
did
not
answer
rossel
was
nervously
gazing
at
the
snow
thinking
of
other
things
and
he
called
again
several
moments
later
the
realization
of
what
was
happening
struck
him
like
a
blow
three
had
never
once
failed
to
answer
all
they
had
to
do
when
they
heard
the
signal
buzz
was
go
into
the
radio
shack
and
say
hello
that
was
all
they
had
to
do
he
called
again
and
again
but
nobody
answered
there
was
no
static
and
no
interference
and
he
did
hear
a
thing
he
checked
frenziedly
through
his
own
apparatus
and
tried
again
but
the
air
was
as
dead
as
deep
space
he
raced
out
to
tell
dylan
dylan
accepted
it
he
had
known
none
of
the
people
on
three
and
what
he
felt
now
was
a
much
greater
urgency
to
be
out
of
here
he
said
hopeful
things
to
rossel
and
then
went
out
to
the
ship
and
joined
the
men
in
lightening
her
about
the
ship
at
least
he
knew
something
and
he
was
able
to
tell
them
what
partitions
and
frames
could
go
and
what
would
have
to
stay
or
the
ship
would
never
get
off
the
planet
but
even
stripped
down
it
could
take
them
all
when
he
knew
that
he
realized
that
he
himself
would
have
to
stay
here
for
it
was
only
then
that
he
thought
of
bossio
three
was
dead
bossio
had
gone
down
there
some
time
ago
and
if
three
was
dead
and
bossio
had
not
called
then
the
fact
was
that
bossio
was
gone
too
for
a
long
long
moment
dylan
stood
rooted
in
the
snow
more
than
the
fact
that
he
would
have
to
stay
here
was
the
unspoken
unalterable
knowledge
that
bossio
was
dead
the
one
thing
that
dylan
could
not
accept
bossio
was
the
only
friend
he
had
in
all
this
aimless
universe
bossio
was
all
his
friendship
and
his
trust
he
left
the
ship
blindly
and
went
back
to
the
settlement
now
the
people
were
quiet
and
really
frightened
and
some
of
the
women
were
beginning
to
cry
he
noticed
now
that
they
had
begun
to
look
at
him
with
hope
as
he
passed
and
in
his
own
grief
humanly
he
swore
bossio
a
kid
with
no
parents
no
enemies
no
grudges
bossio
was
already
dead
because
he
had
come
out
here
and
tried
to
help
these
people
people
who
had
kicked
or
ignored
him
all
the
days
of
his
life
and
in
a
short
while
dylan
would
also
stay
behind
and
die
to
save
the
life
of
somebody
he
never
knew
and
who
hours
earlier
would
have
been
ashamed
to
be
found
in
his
company
now
when
it
was
far
far
too
late
they
were
coming
to
the
army
for
help
but
in
the
end
damn
it
he
could
not
hate
these
people
all
they
had
ever
wanted
was
peace
and
even
though
they
had
never
understood
that
the
universe
is
unknowable
and
that
you
must
always
have
big
shoulders
still
they
had
always
sought
only
for
peace
if
peace
leads
to
no
conflict
at
all
and
then
decay
well
that
was
something
that
had
to
be
learned
so
he
could
not
hate
these
people
but
he
could
not
help
them
either
he
turned
from
their
eyes
and
went
into
the
radio
shack
it
had
begun
to
dawn
on
the
women
that
they
might
be
leaving
without
their
husbands
or
sons
and
he
did
not
want
to
see
the
fierce
struggle
that
he
was
sure
would
take
place
he
sat
alone
and
tried
for
the
last
time
to
call
bossio
after
a
while
an
old
woman
found
him
and
offered
him
coffee
it
was
a
very
decent
thing
to
do
to
think
of
him
at
a
time
like
this
and
he
was
so
suddenly
grateful
he
could
only
nod
the
woman
said
that
he
must
be
cold
in
that
thin
army
thing
and
that
she
had
brought
along
a
mackinaw
for
him
she
poured
the
coffee
and
left
him
alone
they
were
thinking
of
him
now
he
knew
because
they
were
thinking
of
everyone
who
had
to
stay
throw
the
dog
a
bone
dammit
do
be
like
that
he
told
himself
he
had
not
had
anything
to
eat
all
day
and
the
coffee
was
warm
and
strong
he
decided
he
might
be
of
some
help
at
the
ship
it
was
stripped
down
now
and
they
were
loading
he
was
startled
to
see
a
great
group
of
them
standing
in
the
snow
removing
their
clothes
then
he
understood
the
clothes
of
forty
people
would
change
the
weight
by
enough
to
get
a
few
more
aboard
there
was
no
fighting
some
of
the
women
were
almost
hysterical
and
a
few
had
refused
to
go
and
were
still
in
their
cabins
but
the
process
was
orderly
children
went
automatically
as
did
the
youngest
husbands
and
all
the
women
the
elders
were
shuffling
around
in
the
snow
waving
their
arms
to
keep
themselves
warm
some
of
them
were
laughing
to
keep
their
spirits
up
in
the
end
the
ship
took
people
rossel
was
one
of
the
ones
that
would
not
be
going
dylan
saw
him
standing
by
the
airlock
holding
his
wife
in
his
arms
his
face
buried
in
her
soft
brown
hair
a
sense
of
great
sympathy
totally
unexpected
rose
up
in
dylan
and
a
little
of
the
lostness
of
thirty
years
went
slipping
away
these
were
his
people
it
was
a
thing
he
had
never
understood
before
because
he
had
never
once
been
among
men
in
great
trouble
he
waited
and
watched
learning
trying
to
digest
this
while
there
was
still
time
then
the
colonists
were
inside
and
the
airlock
closed
but
when
the
ship
tried
to
lift
there
was
a
sharp
burning
smell
she
could
get
off
the
ground
rush
was
sitting
hunched
over
in
the
snow
his
rifle
across
his
knees
he
was
coated
a
thick
white
and
if
he
had
spoken
dylan
would
have
stumbled
over
him
dylan
took
out
his
pistol
and
sat
down
what
happened
rush
asked
lining
burned
out
she
being
repaired
coincidence
dylan
shook
his
head
how
long
it
take
to
fix
four
five
hours
it
be
night
by
then
rush
paused
i
wonder
seems
like
they
want
to
wait
dark
that
what
i
was
figurin
could
be
they
ai
got
much
of
a
force
dylan
shrugged
also
could
mean
they
see
better
at
night
also
could
mean
they
move
slow
also
could
mean
they
want
the
least
number
of
casualties
rush
was
quiet
and
the
snow
fell
softly
on
his
face
on
his
eyebrows
where
it
had
begun
to
gather
at
length
he
said
you
got
any
idea
how
they
got
to
the
ship
dylan
shook
his
head
again
nobody
saw
anything
but
they
were
all
pretty
busy
your
theory
about
it
maybe
being
one
of
us
is
beginning
to
look
pretty
good
the
colonist
took
off
his
gloves
lit
a
cigarette
the
flame
was
strong
and
piercing
and
dylan
moved
to
check
him
but
stopped
it
did
make
much
difference
the
aliens
knew
where
they
were
and
this
is
right
where
we
gon
na
be
he
thought
you
know
he
said
suddenly
speaking
mostly
to
himself
i
been
in
the
army
thirty
years
and
this
is
the
first
time
i
was
ever
in
a
fight
once
in
a
while
we
used
to
chase
smugglers
never
caught
any
their
ships
were
new
used
to
cut
out
after
unlicensed
ships
used
to
do
all
kinds
of
piddling
things
like
that
but
i
never
shot
at
anybody
rush
was
looking
off
into
the
woods
maybe
the
mail
ship
will
come
in
dylan
nodded
they
got
a
franchise
dammit
they
got
to
deliver
as
long
as
they
a
colony
here
when
dylan
did
answer
he
said
almost
appealingly
some
of
those
guys
would
walk
barefoot
through
hell
for
a
buck
maybe
dylan
said
after
all
why
not
let
him
hope
there
were
four
long
hours
left
now
he
began
to
look
down
into
himself
curiously
because
he
himself
was
utterly
without
hope
and
yet
he
was
no
longer
really
afraid
it
was
a
surprising
thing
when
you
looked
at
it
coldly
and
he
guessed
that
after
all
it
was
because
of
the
thirty
years
a
part
of
him
had
waited
for
this
some
crazy
part
of
him
was
ready
even
after
all
this
time
even
excited
about
being
in
a
fight
well
what
the
hell
he
marveled
and
then
he
realized
that
the
rest
of
him
was
awakening
too
and
he
saw
that
this
job
was
really
his
that
he
had
always
been
in
truth
a
soldier
dylan
sat
finding
himself
in
the
snow
once
long
ago
he
had
read
about
some
fool
who
did
want
to
die
in
bed
old
and
feeble
this
character
wanted
to
reach
the
height
of
his
powers
and
then
explode
in
a
grand
way
in
technicolor
the
man
had
said
explode
in
technicolor
it
was
meant
to
be
funny
of
course
but
he
had
always
remembered
it
and
he
realized
now
that
that
was
a
small
part
of
what
he
was
feeling
the
rest
of
it
was
that
he
was
a
soldier
said
a
small
voice
but
he
could
listen
say
cap
rush
was
saying
it
getting
a
mite
chilly
i
understand
you
got
a
bottle
sure
he
said
cheerfully
near
forgot
it
he
pulled
it
out
and
gave
it
to
rush
the
colonist
broke
the
seal
and
drank
saying
to
dylan
one
for
the
road
beneath
them
the
planet
revolved
and
the
night
came
on
they
waited
speaking
briefly
while
the
unseen
sun
went
down
and
faintly
dimly
through
the
snow
they
heard
at
last
the
muffled
beating
of
a
ship
it
passed
overhead
and
they
were
sighting
their
guns
before
they
recognized
it
it
was
the
mailship
they
listened
while
she
settled
in
a
field
by
the
camp
and
rush
was
pounding
dylan
arm
she
will
take
us
all
rush
was
shouting
she
take
us
all
and
dylan
too
was
grinning
and
then
he
saw
a
thing
small
and
shadowy
and
almost
invisible
the
thing
had
come
out
of
the
woods
and
was
moving
toward
them
bobbing
and
shuffling
in
the
silent
snow
dylan
fired
instinctively
because
the
thing
had
four
arms
and
was
coming
right
at
him
he
fired
again
this
time
he
hit
it
and
the
thing
fell
but
almost
immediately
it
was
up
and
lurching
rapidly
back
into
the
trees
it
was
gone
before
dylan
could
fire
again
they
both
lay
flat
in
the
snow
from
the
camp
there
were
now
no
sounds
at
all
for
the
first
time
today
dylan
could
hear
the
snow
fall
did
you
get
a
good
look
rush
grunted
relaxing
should
saved
your
fire
son
looked
like
one
o
them
monkeys
but
there
was
something
wrong
there
was
something
that
dylan
had
heard
in
the
quickness
of
the
moment
which
he
could
not
remember
but
which
was
very
wrong
listen
he
said
suddenly
placing
it
dammit
that
was
no
monkey
easy
i
hit
it
i
hit
it
cold
it
made
a
rush
was
staring
at
him
did
you
hear
dylan
cried
no
your
gun
was
by
my
ear
and
then
dylan
was
up
and
running
hunched
over
across
the
snow
to
where
the
thing
had
fallen
he
had
seen
a
piece
of
it
break
off
when
the
bolt
struck
and
now
in
the
snow
he
picked
up
a
paw
and
brought
it
back
to
rush
he
saw
right
away
there
was
no
blood
the
skin
was
real
and
furry
all
right
but
there
was
no
blood
because
the
bone
was
steel
and
the
muscles
were
springs
and
the
thing
had
been
a
robot
the
alien
rose
up
from
his
cot
whistling
with
annoyance
when
that
ship
had
come
in
his
attention
had
been
distracted
from
one
of
the
robots
and
of
course
the
miserable
thing
had
gone
blundering
right
out
into
the
humans
he
thought
for
a
while
that
the
humans
would
overlook
it
the
seeing
was
poor
and
they
undoubtedly
would
still
think
of
it
as
animal
even
with
its
firing
ports
open
but
then
he
checked
the
robot
and
saw
that
a
piece
was
missing
and
knew
that
the
humans
had
found
it
well
he
thought
unhappily
flowing
into
his
suit
no
chance
now
to
disable
that
other
ship
the
humans
would
never
let
another
animal
near
and
therefore
for
he
was
above
all
a
flexible
being
he
would
proceed
to
another
plan
the
settlement
would
have
to
be
detonated
and
for
that
he
would
have
to
leave
his
own
shelter
and
go
out
in
that
miserable
cold
and
lie
down
in
one
of
his
bunkers
which
was
much
farther
away
no
need
to
risk
blowing
himself
up
with
his
own
bombs
but
still
that
awful
cold
he
dismissed
his
regrets
and
buckled
his
suit
into
place
it
carried
him
up
the
stairs
and
bore
him
out
into
the
snow
after
one
whiff
of
the
cold
he
snapped
his
viewplate
shut
and
immediately
as
he
had
expected
it
began
to
film
with
snow
well
no
matter
he
would
guide
the
unit
by
coordinates
and
it
would
find
the
bunker
itself
no
need
for
caution
now
the
plan
was
nearly
ended
in
spite
of
his
recent
setback
the
alien
lay
back
and
allowed
himself
the
satisfaction
of
a
full
tremble
the
plan
had
worked
very
nearly
to
perfection
as
of
course
it
should
and
he
delighted
in
the
contemplation
of
it
when
the
humans
were
first
detected
in
the
region
of
bootes
much
thought
had
gone
into
the
proper
method
of
learning
their
technology
without
being
discovered
themselves
there
was
little
purpose
in
destroying
the
humans
without
first
learning
from
them
life
was
really
a
remarkable
thing
one
never
knew
what
critical
secrets
a
race
possessed
hence
the
robots
and
it
was
an
extraordinary
plan
an
elegant
plan
the
alien
trembled
again
the
humans
were
moving
outward
toward
the
rim
their
base
was
apparently
somewhere
beyond
centaurus
therefore
a
ring
of
defense
was
thrown
up
on
most
of
the
habitable
worlds
toward
which
the
humans
were
coming
oh
a
delightful
plan
and
the
humans
came
down
one
by
one
and
never
realized
that
there
was
any
defense
at
all
with
a
cleverness
which
was
almost
excruciating
the
aliens
had
carefully
selected
a
number
of
animals
native
to
each
world
and
then
constructed
robot
duplicates
so
simple
then
to
place
the
robots
down
on
a
world
with
a
single
director
then
wait
for
the
humans
to
inhabit
naturally
the
humans
screened
all
the
animals
and
scouted
a
planet
pretty
thoroughly
before
they
set
up
a
colony
naturally
their
snares
and
their
hunters
caught
no
robots
and
never
found
the
alien
director
then
the
humans
relaxed
and
began
to
make
homes
never
realizing
that
in
among
the
animals
which
gamboled
playfully
in
the
trees
there
was
one
which
did
not
gambol
but
watched
never
once
noticing
the
animals
or
the
small
thing
like
a
rabbit
which
was
a
camera
eye
or
the
thing
like
a
rat
which
took
chemical
samples
or
the
thing
like
a
lizard
which
cut
wires
the
alien
rumbled
on
through
the
snow
trembling
so
much
now
with
ecstasy
and
anticipation
that
the
suit
which
bore
him
almost
lost
its
balance
he
very
nearly
fell
over
before
he
stopped
trembling
and
then
he
contained
himself
in
a
little
while
a
very
little
while
there
would
be
time
enough
for
trembling
they
could
been
here
the
sun
went
out
rush
said
and
we
never
would
known
i
wonder
how
much
they
found
out
dylan
said
rush
was
holding
the
paw
pretty
near
everything
i
guess
this
stuff
do
stop
at
monkeys
could
be
any
size
any
kind
look
let
get
down
into
camp
and
tell
dylan
rose
slowly
to
a
kneeling
position
peering
dazedly
out
into
the
far
white
trees
his
mind
was
turning
over
and
over
around
and
around
like
a
roulette
wheel
but
at
the
center
of
his
mind
there
was
one
thought
and
it
was
rising
up
slowly
now
through
the
waste
and
waiting
of
the
years
he
felt
a
vague
surprise
gettin
kind
of
dark
he
said
rush
swore
let
go
let
get
out
of
here
he
tugged
once
at
dylan
arm
and
started
off
on
his
knees
dylan
said
wait
rush
stopped
through
the
snow
he
tried
to
see
dylan
eyes
the
soldier
was
still
looking
into
the
woods
dylan
voice
was
halting
and
almost
inaudible
they
know
everything
about
us
we
do
know
anything
about
them
they
probably
out
there
right
now
a
swarm
of
there
behind
those
trees
for
it
to
get
real
nice
and
dark
he
paused
if
i
could
get
just
one
it
was
totally
unexpected
to
dylan
as
well
as
rush
the
time
for
this
sort
of
thing
was
past
the
age
was
done
and
for
a
long
while
neither
of
them
fully
understood
rush
said
with
exasperation
dylan
shook
his
head
marveling
at
himself
i
be
with
you
in
a
little
while
rush
came
near
and
looked
questioningly
into
his
face
listen
dylan
said
hurriedly
we
only
need
one
if
we
could
just
get
one
back
to
a
lab
we
at
least
have
some
clue
to
what
they
are
this
way
we
do
know
anything
we
ca
just
cut
and
run
he
struggled
with
the
unfamiliar
words
we
got
to
make
a
stand
he
turned
from
rush
and
lay
forward
on
his
belly
in
the
snow
he
could
feel
his
heart
beating
against
the
soft
white
cushion
beneath
him
there
was
no
time
to
look
at
this
calmly
and
he
was
glad
of
that
he
spent
some
time
being
very
much
afraid
of
the
unknown
things
beyond
the
trees
but
even
then
he
realized
that
this
was
the
one
thing
in
his
life
he
had
to
do
it
is
not
a
matter
of
dying
he
thought
but
of
sooner
or
later
a
man
must
do
a
thing
which
justifies
his
life
or
the
life
is
not
worth
living
the
long
cold
line
of
his
existence
had
reached
this
point
here
and
now
in
the
snow
at
this
moment
he
would
go
on
from
here
as
a
man
or
not
at
all
rush
had
sat
down
beside
him
beginning
to
understand
watching
without
words
he
was
an
old
man
like
all
earthmen
he
had
never
fought
with
his
hands
he
had
not
fought
the
land
or
the
tides
or
the
weather
or
any
of
the
million
bitter
sicknesses
which
man
had
grown
up
fighting
and
he
was
beginning
to
realize
that
somewhere
along
the
line
he
had
been
betrayed
now
with
a
dead
paw
of
the
enemy
in
his
hand
he
did
not
feel
like
a
man
and
he
was
ready
to
fight
now
but
it
was
much
too
late
and
he
saw
with
a
vast
leaden
shame
that
he
did
not
know
how
could
not
even
begin
can
i
help
he
said
dylan
shook
his
head
go
back
and
let
them
know
about
the
robots
and
if
the
ship
is
ready
to
leave
before
i
get
back
well
then
good
luck
he
started
to
slither
forward
on
his
belly
but
rush
reached
out
and
grabbed
him
holding
with
one
hand
to
peace
and
gentleness
and
the
soft
days
which
were
ending
listen
he
said
you
do
owe
anybody
dylan
stared
at
him
with
surprise
i
know
he
said
and
then
he
slipped
up
over
the
mound
before
him
and
headed
for
the
trees
now
what
he
needed
was
luck
just
good
plain
old
luck
he
did
know
where
they
were
or
how
many
there
were
or
what
kinds
there
were
and
the
chances
were
good
that
one
of
them
was
watching
him
right
now
well
then
he
needed
some
luck
he
inched
forward
slowly
carefully
watching
the
oncoming
line
of
trees
the
snow
was
falling
on
him
in
big
leafy
flakes
and
that
was
fine
because
the
blackness
of
his
suit
was
much
too
distinct
and
the
more
white
he
was
the
better
even
so
it
was
becoming
quite
dark
by
now
and
he
thought
he
had
a
chance
he
reached
the
first
tree
silently
he
slipped
off
his
heavy
cap
the
visor
got
in
his
way
and
above
all
he
must
be
able
to
see
he
let
the
snow
thicken
on
his
hair
before
he
raised
himself
on
his
elbows
and
looked
outward
there
was
nothing
but
the
snow
and
the
dead
quiet
and
the
stark
white
boles
of
the
trees
he
slid
past
the
first
trunk
to
the
next
moving
forward
on
his
elbows
with
his
pistol
in
his
right
hand
his
elbow
struck
a
rock
and
it
hurt
and
his
face
was
freezing
once
he
rubbed
snow
from
his
eyebrows
then
he
came
through
the
trees
and
lay
down
before
a
slight
rise
thinking
better
to
go
around
than
over
but
if
anything
is
watching
it
is
most
likely
watching
from
above
therefore
go
around
and
come
back
up
from
behind
yes
his
nose
had
begun
to
run
with
great
care
he
crawled
among
some
large
rocks
hoping
against
hope
that
he
would
not
sneeze
why
had
nothing
seen
him
was
something
following
him
now
he
turned
to
look
behind
him
but
it
was
darker
now
and
becoming
difficult
to
see
but
he
would
have
to
look
behind
him
more
often
he
was
moving
down
a
gorge
there
were
large
trees
above
him
and
he
needed
their
shelter
but
he
could
not
risk
slipping
down
the
sides
of
the
gorge
and
far
off
weakly
out
of
the
gray
cold
ahead
he
heard
a
noise
he
lay
face
down
in
the
snow
listening
with
a
slow
thick
shuffle
a
thing
was
moving
through
the
trees
before
him
in
a
moment
he
saw
that
it
was
not
coming
toward
him
he
lifted
his
head
but
saw
nothing
much
more
slowly
now
he
crawled
again
the
thing
was
moving
down
the
left
side
of
the
gorge
ahead
coming
away
from
the
rise
he
had
circled
it
was
moving
without
caution
and
he
worried
that
if
he
did
not
hurry
he
would
lose
it
but
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
stand
up
the
soldier
went
forward
on
his
hands
and
knees
when
his
clothes
hung
down
the
freezing
cold
entered
his
throat
and
shocked
his
body
which
was
sweating
he
shifted
his
gun
to
his
gloved
hand
and
blew
on
the
bare
fingers
of
his
right
still
crawling
when
he
reached
the
other
end
of
the
gorge
he
stood
upright
against
a
rock
wall
and
looked
in
the
direction
of
the
shuffling
thing
he
saw
it
just
as
it
turned
it
was
a
great
black
lump
on
a
platform
the
platform
had
legs
and
the
thing
was
plodding
methodically
upon
a
path
which
would
bring
it
past
him
it
had
come
down
from
the
rise
and
was
rounding
the
gorge
when
dylan
saw
it
it
did
not
see
him
if
he
had
not
ducked
quickly
and
brought
up
his
gun
the
monkey
would
not
have
seen
him
either
but
there
was
no
time
for
regret
the
monkey
was
several
yards
to
the
right
of
the
lump
on
the
platform
when
he
heard
it
start
running
and
he
had
to
look
up
this
time
and
saw
it
leaping
toward
him
over
the
snow
all
right
he
said
to
himself
his
first
shot
took
the
monkey
in
the
head
where
the
eyes
were
as
the
thing
crashed
over
there
was
a
hiss
and
a
stench
and
flame
seared
into
his
shoulder
and
the
side
of
his
face
he
lurched
to
the
side
trying
to
see
his
gun
at
as
the
lump
on
the
platform
spun
toward
him
he
fired
four
times
three
bolts
went
home
in
the
lump
the
fourth
tore
a
leg
off
the
platform
and
the
whole
thing
fell
over
dylan
crawled
painfully
behind
a
rock
his
left
arm
useless
the
silence
had
come
back
again
and
he
waited
but
neither
of
the
alien
things
moved
nothing
else
moved
in
the
woods
around
him
he
turned
his
face
up
to
the
falling
snow
and
let
it
come
soothingly
upon
the
awful
wound
in
his
side
after
a
while
he
looked
out
at
the
monkey
it
had
risen
to
a
sitting
position
but
was
frozen
in
the
motion
of
rising
it
had
ceased
to
function
when
he
hit
the
lump
out
of
the
numbness
and
the
pain
he
felt
a
great
gladness
rising
the
guide
he
had
killed
the
guide
he
would
not
be
cautious
any
more
maybe
some
of
the
other
robots
were
and
dangerous
but
they
could
be
handled
he
went
to
the
lump
stared
at
it
without
feeling
a
black
doughy
bulge
was
swelling
out
through
one
of
the
holes
it
was
too
big
to
carry
but
he
would
have
to
take
something
back
he
went
over
and
took
the
monkey
by
a
stiff
jutting
arm
and
began
dragging
it
back
toward
the
village
now
he
began
to
stumble
it
was
dark
and
he
was
very
tired
but
the
steel
he
had
been
forging
in
his
breast
was
complete
and
the
days
which
were
coming
would
be
days
full
of
living
he
would
walk
with
big
shoulders
and
he
would
not
bother
to
question
because
man
was
not
born
to
live
out
his
days
at
home
by
the
fire
it
was
a
very
big
thing
that
dylan
had
learned
and
he
could
not
express
it
but
he
knew
it
all
the
same
knew
it
beyond
understanding
and
so
he
went
home
to
his
people
one
by
one
increasing
in
the
wee
black
corner
of
space
which
man
had
taken
for
his
own
other
men
were
learning
and
the
snow
fell
and
the
planets
whirled
and
when
it
was
spring
where
dylan
had
fought
men
were
already
leaping
back
out
to
the
stars
