but
finally
i
opened
the
box
gazing
into
the

was
tom
bragdon
goin
to
keep
a
diary
the
water
ghost
of
harrowby
hall
the
trouble
with
harrowby
hall
was
that
it
was
haunted
and
what
was
worse
the
ghost
did
not
content
itself
with
merely
appearing
at
the
bedside
of
the
afflicted
person
who
saw
it
but
persisted
in
remaining
there
for
one
mortal
hour
before
it
would
disappear
it
never
appeared
except
on
christmas
eve
and
then
as
the
clock
was
striking
twelve
in
which
respect
alone
was
it
lacking
in
that
originality
which
in
these
days
is
a
qua
of
success
in
spectral
life
the
owners
of
harrowby
hall
had
done
their
utmost
to
rid
themselves
of
the
damp
and
dewy
lady
who
rose
up
out
of
the
best
bedroom
floor
at
midnight
but
without
avail
they
had
tried
stopping
the
clock
so
that
the
ghost
would
not
know
when
it
was
midnight
but
she
made
her
appearance
just
the
same
with
that
fearful
miasmatic
personality
of
hers
and
there
she
would
stand
until
everything
about
her
was
thoroughly
saturated
then
the
owners
of
harrowby
hall
calked
up
every
crack
in
the
floor
with
the
very
best
quality
of
hemp
and
over
this
was
placed
layers
of
tar
and
canvas
the
walls
were
made
and
the
doors
and
windows
likewise
the
proprietors
having
conceived
the
notion
that
the
unexorcised
lady
would
find
it
difficult
to
leak
into
the
room
after
these
precautions
had
been
taken
but
even
this
did
not
suffice
the
following
christmas
eve
she
appeared
as
promptly
as
before
and
frightened
the
occupant
of
the
room
quite
out
of
his
senses
by
sitting
down
alongside
of
him
and
gazing
with
her
cavernous
blue
eyes
into
his
and
he
noticed
too
that
in
her
long
aqueously
bony
fingers
bits
of
dripping
were
entwined
the
ends
hanging
down
and
these
ends
she
drew
across
his
forehead
until
he
became
like
one
insane
and
then
he
swooned
away
and
was
found
unconscious
in
his
bed
the
next
morning
by
his
host
simply
saturated
with
and
fright
from
the
combined
effects
of
which
he
never
recovered
dying
four
years
later
of
pneumonia
and
nervous
prostration
at
the
age
of
the
next
year
the
master
of
harrowby
hall
decided
not
to
have
the
best
spare
bedroom
opened
at
all
thinking
that
perhaps
the
ghost
thirst
for
making
herself
disagreeable
would
be
satisfied
by
haunting
the
furniture
but
the
plan
was
as
unavailing
as
the
many
that
had
preceded
it
the
ghost
appeared
as
usual
in
the
room
that
is
it
was
supposed
she
did
for
the
hangings
were
dripping
wet
the
next
morning
and
in
the
parlor
below
the
haunted
room
a
great
damp
spot
appeared
on
the
ceiling
finding
no
one
there
she
immediately
set
out
to
learn
the
reason
why
and
she
chose
none
other
to
haunt
than
the
owner
of
the
harrowby
himself
she
found
him
in
his
own
cosey
room
drinking
whiskey
whiskey
undiluted
and
felicitating
himself
upon
having
foiled
her
ghostship
when
all
of
a
sudden
the
curl
went
out
of
his
hair
his
whiskey
bottle
filled
and
overflowed
and
he
was
himself
in
a
condition
similar
to
that
of
a
man
who
has
fallen
into
a
when
he
recovered
from
the
shock
which
was
a
painful
one
he
saw
before
him
the
lady
of
the
cavernous
eyes
and
fingers
the
sight
was
so
unexpected
and
so
terrifying
that
he
fainted
but
immediately
came
to
because
of
the
vast
amount
of
water
in
his
hair
which
trickling
down
over
his
face
restored
his
consciousness
now
it
so
happened
that
the
master
of
harrowby
was
a
brave
man
and
while
he
was
not
particularly
fond
of
interviewing
ghosts
especially
such
quenching
ghosts
as
the
one
before
him
he
was
not
to
be
daunted
by
an
apparition
he
had
paid
the
lady
the
compliment
of
fainting
from
the
effects
of
his
first
surprise
and
now
that
he
had
come
to
he
intended
to
find
out
a
few
things
he
felt
he
had
a
right
to
know
he
would
have
liked
to
put
on
a
dry
suit
of
clothes
first
but
the
apparition
declined
to
leave
him
for
an
instant
until
her
hour
was
up
and
he
was
forced
to
deny
himself
that
pleasure
every
time
he
would
move
she
would
follow
him
with
the
result
that
everything
she
came
in
contact
with
got
a
ducking
in
an
effort
to
warm
himself
up
he
approached
the
fire
an
unfortunate
move
as
it
turned
out
because
it
brought
the
ghost
directly
over
the
fire
which
immediately
was
extinguished
the
whiskey
became
utterly
valueless
as
a
comforter
to
his
chilled
system
because
it
was
by
this
time
diluted
to
a
proportion
of
ninety
per
cent
of
water
the
only
thing
he
could
do
to
ward
off
the
evil
effects
of
his
encounter
he
did
and
that
was
to
swallow
ten
quinine
pills
which
he
managed
to
put
into
his
mouth
before
the
ghost
had
time
to
interfere
having
done
this
he
turned
with
some
asperity
to
the
ghost
and
said
far
be
it
from
me
to
be
impolite
to
a
woman
madam
but
i
hanged
if
it
would
please
me
better
if
you
stop
these
infernal
visits
of
yours
to
this
house
go
sit
out
on
the
lake
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
soak
the
if
you
wish
but
do
not
i
implore
you
come
into
a
gentleman
house
and
saturate
him
and
his
possessions
in
this
way
it
is
damned
disagreeable
henry
hartwick
oglethorpe
said
the
ghost
in
a
gurgling
voice
you
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
madam
returned
the
unhappy
householder
i
wish
that
remark
were
strictly
truthful
i
was
talking
about
you
it
would
be
shillings
and
pence
nay
pounds
in
my
pocket
madam
if
i
did
not
know
you
that
is
a
bit
of
specious
nonsense
returned
the
ghost
throwing
a
quart
of
indignation
into
the
face
of
the
master
of
harrowby
it
may
rank
high
as
repartee
but
as
a
comment
upon
my
statement
that
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
talking
about
it
savors
of
irrelevant
impertinence
you
do
not
know
that
i
am
compelled
to
haunt
this
place
year
after
year
by
inexorable
fate
it
is
no
pleasure
to
me
to
enter
this
house
and
ruin
and
mildew
everything
i
touch
i
never
aspired
to
be
a
but
it
is
my
doom
do
you
know
who
i
am
no
i
do
returned
the
master
of
harrowby
i
should
say
you
were
the
lady
of
the
lake
or
little
sallie
waters
you
are
a
witty
man
for
your
years
said
the
ghost
well
my
humor
is
drier
than
yours
ever
will
be
returned
the
master
no
doubt
i
never
dry
i
am
the
water
ghost
of
harrowby
hall
and
dryness
is
a
quality
entirely
beyond
my
wildest
hope
i
have
been
the
incumbent
of
this
highly
unpleasant
office
for
two
hundred
years
how
the
deuce
did
you
ever
come
to
get
elected
asked
the
master
through
a
suicide
replied
the
spectre
i
am
the
ghost
of
that
fair
maiden
whose
picture
hangs
over
the
in
the
i
should
have
been
your
if
i
had
lived
henry
hartwick
oglethorpe
for
i
was
the
own
sister
of
your
but
what
induced
you
to
get
this
house
into
such
a
predicament
i
was
not
to
blame
sir
returned
the
lady
it
was
my
father
fault
he
it
was
who
built
harrowby
hall
and
the
haunted
chamber
was
to
have
been
mine
my
father
had
it
furnished
in
pink
and
yellow
knowing
well
that
blue
and
gray
formed
the
only
combination
of
color
i
could
tolerate
he
did
it
merely
to
spite
me
and
with
what
i
deem
a
proper
spirit
i
declined
to
live
in
the
room
whereupon
my
father
said
i
could
live
there
or
on
the
lawn
he
did
care
which
that
night
i
ran
from
the
house
and
jumped
over
the
cliff
into
the
sea
that
was
rash
said
the
master
of
harrowby
so
i
heard
returned
the
ghost
if
i
had
known
what
the
consequences
were
to
be
i
should
not
have
jumped
but
i
really
never
realized
what
i
was
doing
until
after
i
was
drowned
i
had
been
drowned
a
week
when
a
came
to
me
and
informed
me
that
i
was
to
be
one
of
her
followers
forever
afterwards
adding
that
it
should
be
my
doom
to
haunt
harrowby
hall
for
one
hour
every
christmas
eve
throughout
the
rest
of
eternity
i
was
to
haunt
that
room
on
such
christmas
eves
as
i
found
it
inhabited
and
if
it
should
turn
out
not
to
be
inhabited
i
was
and
am
to
spend
the
allotted
hour
with
the
head
of
the
house
i
sell
the
place
that
you
can
not
do
for
it
is
also
required
of
me
that
i
shall
appear
as
the
deeds
are
to
be
delivered
to
any
purchaser
and
divulge
to
him
the
awful
secret
of
the
house
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
on
every
christmas
eve
that
i
do
happen
to
have
somebody
in
that
you
are
going
to
haunt
me
wherever
i
may
be
ruining
my
whiskey
taking
all
the
curl
out
of
my
hair
extinguishing
my
fire
and
soaking
me
through
to
the
skin
demanded
the
master
you
have
stated
the
case
oglethorpe
and
what
is
more
said
the
water
ghost
it
does
make
the
slightest
difference
where
you
are
if
i
find
that
room
empty
wherever
you
may
be
i
shall
douse
you
with
my
spectral
pres
here
the
clock
struck
one
and
immediately
the
apparition
faded
away
it
was
perhaps
more
of
a
trickle
than
a
fade
but
as
a
disappearance
it
was
complete
by
george
and
his
dragon
ejaculated
the
master
of
harrowby
wringing
his
hands
it
is
guineas
to
buns
that
next
christmas
there
an
occupant
of
the
spare
room
or
i
spend
the
night
in
a
but
the
master
of
harrowby
would
have
lost
his
wager
had
there
been
any
one
there
to
take
him
up
for
when
christmas
eve
came
again
he
was
in
his
grave
never
having
recovered
from
the
cold
contracted
that
awful
night
harrowby
hall
was
closed
and
the
heir
to
the
estate
was
in
london
where
to
him
in
his
chambers
came
the
same
experience
that
his
father
had
gone
through
saving
only
that
being
younger
and
stronger
he
survived
the
shock
everything
in
his
rooms
was
ruined
his
clocks
were
rusted
in
the
works
a
fine
collection
of
drawings
was
entirely
obliterated
by
the
onslaught
of
the
water
ghost
and
what
was
worse
the
apartments
below
his
were
drenched
with
the
water
soaking
through
the
floors
a
damage
for
which
he
was
compelled
to
pay
and
which
resulted
in
his
being
requested
by
his
landlady
to
vacate
the
premises
immediately
the
story
of
the
visitation
inflicted
upon
his
family
had
gone
abroad
and
no
one
could
be
got
to
invite
him
out
to
any
function
save
afternoon
teas
and
receptions
fathers
of
daughters
declined
to
permit
him
to
remain
in
their
houses
later
than
eight
at
night
not
knowing
but
that
some
emergency
might
arise
in
the
supernatural
world
which
would
require
the
unexpected
appearance
of
the
water
ghost
in
this
on
nights
other
than
christmas
eve
and
before
the
mystic
hour
when
weary
churchyards
ignoring
the
rules
which
are
supposed
to
govern
polite
society
begin
to
yawn
nor
would
the
maids
themselves
have
aught
to
do
with
him
fearing
the
destruction
by
the
sudden
incursion
of
aqueous
femininity
of
the
costumes
which
they
held
most
dear
so
the
heir
of
harrowby
hall
resolved
as
his
ancestors
for
several
generations
before
him
had
resolved
that
something
must
be
done
his
first
thought
was
to
make
one
of
his
servants
occupy
the
haunted
room
at
the
crucial
moment
but
in
this
he
failed
because
the
servants
themselves
knew
the
history
of
that
room
and
rebelled
none
of
his
friends
would
consent
to
sacrifice
their
personal
comfort
to
his
nor
was
there
to
be
found
in
all
england
a
man
so
poor
as
to
be
willing
to
occupy
the
doomed
chamber
on
christmas
eve
for
pay
then
the
thought
came
to
the
heir
to
have
the
fireplace
in
the
room
enlarged
so
that
he
might
evaporate
the
ghost
at
its
first
appearance
and
he
was
felicitating
himself
upon
the
ingenuity
of
his
plan
when
he
remembered
what
his
father
had
told
him
how
that
no
fire
could
withstand
the
lady
extremely
contagious
dampness
and
then
he
bethought
him
of
these
he
remembered
could
lie
hundreds
of
feet
deep
in
water
and
still
retain
sufficient
heat
to
drive
the
water
away
in
vapor
and
as
a
result
of
this
thought
the
haunted
room
was
heated
by
steam
to
a
withering
degree
and
the
heir
for
six
months
attended
daily
the
turkish
baths
so
that
when
christmas
eve
came
he
could
himself
withstand
the
awful
temperature
of
the
room
the
scheme
was
only
partially
successful
the
water
ghost
appeared
at
the
specified
time
and
found
the
heir
of
harrowby
prepared
but
hot
as
the
room
was
it
shortened
her
visit
by
no
more
than
five
minutes
in
the
hour
during
which
time
the
nervous
system
of
the
young
master
was
wellnigh
shattered
and
the
room
itself
was
cracked
and
warped
to
an
extent
which
required
the
outlay
of
a
large
sum
of
money
to
remedy
and
worse
than
this
as
the
last
drop
of
the
water
ghost
was
slowly
sizzling
itself
out
on
the
floor
she
whispered
to
her
conqueror
that
his
scheme
would
avail
him
nothing
because
there
was
still
water
in
great
plenty
where
she
came
from
and
that
next
year
would
find
her
rehabilitated
and
as
exasperatingly
saturating
as
ever
it
was
then
that
the
natural
action
of
the
mind
in
going
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
suggested
to
the
ingenious
heir
of
harrowby
the
means
by
which
the
water
ghost
was
ultimately
conquered
and
happiness
once
more
came
within
the
grasp
of
the
house
of
oglethorpe
the
heir
provided
himself
with
a
warm
suit
of
fur
donning
this
with
the
furry
side
in
he
placed
over
it
a
rubber
garment
tightfitting
which
he
wore
just
as
a
woman
wears
a
jersey
on
top
of
this
he
placed
another
set
of
this
suit
made
of
wool
and
over
this
was
a
second
rubber
garment
like
the
first
upon
his
head
he
placed
a
light
and
comfortable
diving
helmet
and
so
clad
on
the
following
christmas
eve
he
awaited
the
coming
of
his
tormentor
it
was
a
bitterly
cold
night
that
brought
to
a
close
this
day
of
december
the
air
outside
was
still
but
the
temperature
was
below
zero
within
all
was
quiet
the
servants
of
harrowby
hall
awaiting
with
beating
hearts
the
outcome
of
their
master
campaign
against
his
supernatural
visitor
the
master
himself
was
lying
on
the
bed
in
the
haunted
room
clad
as
has
already
been
indicated
and
then
the
clock
clanged
out
the
hour
of
twelve
there
was
a
sudden
banging
of
doors
a
blast
of
cold
air
swept
through
the
halls
the
door
leading
into
the
haunted
chamber
flew
open
a
splash
was
heard
and
the
water
ghost
was
seen
standing
at
the
side
of
the
heir
of
harrowby
from
whose
outer
dress
there
streamed
rivulets
of
water
but
whose
own
person
deep
down
under
the
various
garments
he
wore
was
as
dry
and
as
warm
as
he
could
have
wished
ha
said
the
young
master
of
harrowby
i
glad
to
see
you
you
are
the
most
original
man
i
met
if
that
is
true
returned
the
ghost
may
i
ask
where
did
you
get
that
hat
certainly
madam
returned
the
master
courteously
it
is
a
little
portable
observatory
i
had
made
for
just
such
emergencies
as
this
but
tell
me
is
it
true
that
you
are
doomed
to
follow
me
about
for
one
mortal
hour
to
stand
where
i
stand
to
sit
where
i
sit
that
is
my
delectable
fate
returned
the
lady
we
go
out
on
the
lake
said
the
master
starting
up
you
ca
get
rid
of
me
that
way
returned
the
ghost
the
water
swallow
me
up
in
fact
it
will
just
add
to
my
present
bulk
nevertheless
said
the
master
firmly
we
will
go
out
on
the
lake
but
my
dear
sir
returned
the
ghost
with
a
pale
reluctance
it
is
fearfully
cold
out
there
you
will
be
frozen
hard
before
you
been
out
ten
minutes
oh
no
i
not
replied
the
master
i
am
very
warmly
dressed
come
this
last
in
a
tone
of
command
that
made
the
ghost
ripple
and
they
started
they
had
not
gone
far
before
the
water
ghost
showed
signs
of
distress
you
walk
too
slowly
she
said
i
am
nearly
frozen
my
knees
are
so
stiff
now
i
can
hardly
move
i
beseech
you
to
accelerate
your
step
i
should
like
to
oblige
a
lady
returned
the
master
courteously
but
my
clothes
are
rather
heavy
and
a
hundred
yards
an
hour
is
about
my
speed
indeed
i
think
we
would
better
sit
down
here
on
this
snowdrift
and
talk
matters
over
do
not
do
not
do
so
i
beg
cried
the
ghost
let
me
move
on
i
feel
myself
growing
rigid
as
it
is
if
we
stop
here
i
shall
be
frozen
stiff
that
madam
said
the
master
slowly
and
seating
himself
on
an
that
is
why
i
have
brought
you
here
we
have
been
on
this
spot
just
ten
minutes
we
have
fifty
more
take
your
time
about
it
madam
but
freeze
that
is
all
i
ask
of
you
i
can
not
move
my
right
leg
now
cried
the
ghost
in
despair
and
my
overskirt
is
a
solid
sheet
of
ice
oh
good
kind
oglethorpe
light
a
fire
and
let
me
go
free
from
these
icy
fetters
never
madam
it
can
not
be
i
have
you
at
last
alas
cried
the
ghost
a
tear
trickling
down
her
frozen
cheek
help
me
i
beg
i
congeal
congeal
madam
congeal
returned
oglethorpe
coldly
you
have
drenched
me
and
mine
for
two
hundred
and
three
years
madam
you
have
had
your
last
drench
ah
but
i
shall
thaw
out
again
and
then
you
see
instead
of
the
comfortably
tepid
genial
ghost
i
have
been
in
my
past
sir
i
shall
be
cried
the
lady
threateningly
no
you
wo
either
returned
oglethorpe
for
when
you
are
frozen
quite
stiff
i
shall
send
you
to
a
warehouse
and
there
shall
you
remain
an
icy
work
of
art
forever
more
but
warehouses
burn
so
they
do
but
this
warehouse
can
not
burn
it
is
made
of
asbestos
and
surrounding
it
are
walls
and
within
those
walls
the
temperature
is
now
and
shall
forever
be
degrees
below
the
zero
point
low
enough
to
make
an
icicle
of
any
flame
in
this
world
or
the
next
the
master
added
with
an
chuckle
for
the
last
time
let
me
beseech
you
i
would
go
on
my
knees
to
you
oglethorpe
were
they
not
already
frozen
i
beg
of
you
do
not
doo
here
even
the
words
froze
on
the
water
ghost
lips
and
the
clock
struck
one
there
was
a
momentary
tremor
throughout
the
form
and
the
moon
coming
out
from
behind
a
cloud
shone
down
on
the
rigid
figure
of
a
beautiful
woman
sculptured
in
clear
transparent
ice
there
stood
the
ghost
of
harrowby
hall
conquered
by
the
cold
a
prisoner
for
all
time
the
heir
of
harrowby
had
won
at
last
and
in
a
large
storage
house
in
london
stands
the
frigid
form
of
one
who
will
never
again
flood
the
house
of
oglethorpe
with
woe
and
as
for
the
heir
of
harrowby
his
success
in
coping
with
a
ghost
has
made
him
famous
a
fame
that
still
lingers
about
him
although
his
victory
took
place
some
twenty
years
ago
and
so
far
from
being
unpopular
with
the
fair
sex
as
he
was
when
we
first
knew
him
he
has
not
only
been
married
twice
but
is
to
lead
a
third
bride
to
the
altar
before
the
year
is
out
the
spectre
cook
of
bangletop
i
for
the
purposes
of
this
bit
of
history
bangletop
hall
stands
upon
a
grassy
knoll
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
dee
about
eighteen
miles
from
the
quaint
old
city
of
chester
it
does
not
in
reality
stand
there
nor
has
it
ever
done
so
but
consideration
for
the
interests
of
the
living
compels
me
to
conceal
its
exact
location
and
so
to
befog
the
public
as
to
its
whereabouts
that
its
identity
may
never
be
revealed
to
its
disadvantage
it
is
a
rentable
property
and
were
it
known
that
it
has
had
a
mystery
connected
with
it
of
so
deep
dark
and
eerie
a
nature
as
that
about
to
be
related
i
fear
that
its
usefulness
save
as
an
accessory
to
romance
would
be
seriously
impaired
and
that
as
an
investment
it
would
become
practically
worthless
the
hall
is
a
fair
specimen
of
the
architecture
which
prevailed
at
the
time
of
edward
the
confessor
that
is
to
say
the
main
portion
of
the
structure
erected
in
edward
time
by
the
first
baron
bangletop
has
that
square
substantial
stony
aspect
which
to
the
eye
versed
in
architecture
identifies
it
at
once
as
a
product
of
that
enlightened
era
later
owners
the
successive
barons
bangletop
have
added
to
its
original
dimensions
putting
queen
anne
wings
here
elizabethan
ells
there
and
an
facade
on
the
river
front
a
wisconsin
water
tower
connected
with
the
main
building
by
a
low
gothic
alleyway
stands
to
the
south
while
toward
the
east
is
a
greek
chapel
used
by
the
present
occupant
as
a
for
his
wife
trunks
she
having
lately
returned
from
paris
with
a
wardrobe
calculated
to
last
through
the
first
half
of
the
coming
london
season
altogether
bangletop
hall
is
an
impressive
structure
and
at
first
sight
gives
rise
to
various
emotions
in
the
aesthetic
breast
some
cavil
others
admire
one
leading
architect
of
berlin
travelled
all
the
way
from
his
german
home
to
bangletop
hall
to
show
that
famous
structure
to
his
son
a
student
in
the
profession
which
his
father
adorned
to
whom
he
is
said
to
have
observed
that
architecturally
bangletop
hall
was
cosmopolitan
and
omniperiodic
and
therefore
a
liberal
education
to
all
who
should
come
to
study
and
master
its
details
in
short
bangletop
hall
was
an
to
young
architects
and
showed
them
at
a
glance
that
which
they
should
ever
strive
to
avoid
strange
to
say
for
quite
two
centuries
had
bangletop
hall
remained
without
a
tenant
and
for
nearly
years
it
had
been
in
the
market
for
rent
the
barons
father
and
son
for
many
generations
having
found
it
impossible
to
dwell
within
its
walls
and
for
a
very
good
reason
no
cook
could
ever
be
induced
to
live
at
bangletop
for
a
longer
period
than
two
weeks
why
the
queens
of
the
kitchen
invariably
took
what
is
commonly
known
as
french
leave
no
occupant
could
ever
learn
because
male
or
female
the
departed
domestics
never
returned
to
tell
and
even
had
they
done
so
the
pride
of
the
bangletops
would
not
have
permitted
them
to
listen
to
the
explanation
the
bangletop
escutcheon
was
clear
of
blots
no
suspicion
even
of
a
conversational
blemish
appearing
thereon
and
it
was
always
a
matter
of
extreme
satisfaction
to
the
family
that
no
one
of
its
scions
since
the
title
was
created
had
ever
been
known
to
speak
directly
to
any
one
of
lesser
rank
than
himself
communication
with
inferiors
being
always
had
through
the
medium
of
a
private
secretary
himself
a
baron
or
better
in
reduced
circumstances
the
first
cook
to
leave
bangletop
under
circumstances
of
a
gallic
nature
that
is
without
known
cause
wages
or
luggage
had
been
employed
by
fitzherbert
alexander
seventeenth
baron
of
bangletop
through
charles
mortimor
de
herbert
baron
peddlington
formerly
of
peddlington
manor
at
his
private
secretary
a
handsome
old
gentleman
of
who
had
been
deprived
of
his
estates
by
the
crown
in
because
he
was
suspected
of
having
inspired
a
comic
broadside
published
in
those
troublous
days
and
directed
against
charles
the
first
which
had
set
all
london
in
a
roar
this
broadside
one
of
very
few
which
are
not
preserved
in
the
british
museum
and
a
greater
tribute
to
its
rarity
could
not
be
devised
was
called
a
good
suggestion
as
to
ye
proper
use
of
ye
chinne
whisker
and
consisted
of
a
few
lines
of
doggerel
printed
beneath
a
caricature
of
the
king
with
the
crown
hanging
from
his
goatee
reading
as
follows
king
doth
sporte
a
gallous
grey
goatee
uponne
ye
chinne
where
every
one
may
see
and
since
ye
monarch
head
too
small
to
holde
with
comfort
to
himselfe
ye
crowne
of
gold
why
not
enwax
and
hooke
ye
goatee
rare
and
lette
ye
british
crown
hang
down
from
there
illustration
whether
or
no
the
baron
of
peddlington
was
guilty
of
this
traitorous
effusion
no
one
not
even
the
king
could
ever
really
make
up
his
mind
the
charge
was
never
fully
proven
nor
was
de
herbert
ever
able
to
refute
it
successfully
although
he
made
frantic
efforts
to
do
so
the
king
eminently
just
in
such
matters
gave
the
baron
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
inflicted
only
half
the
penalty
prescribed
confiscating
his
estates
and
letting
him
keep
his
head
and
liberty
de
herbert
family
begged
the
crown
to
reverse
the
sentence
permitting
them
to
keep
the
estates
the
king
taking
their
uncle
head
in
lieu
thereof
he
being
unmarried
and
having
no
children
who
would
mourn
his
loss
but
charles
was
poor
rather
than
vindictive
at
this
period
and
preferring
to
adopt
the
other
course
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
the
petitioners
this
was
probably
one
of
the
earliest
factors
in
the
decadence
of
literature
as
a
pastime
for
men
of
high
station
de
herbert
would
have
starved
had
it
not
been
for
his
old
friend
baron
bangletop
who
offered
him
the
post
of
private
secretary
lately
made
vacant
by
the
death
of
the
duke
of
algeria
who
had
been
the
incumbent
of
that
office
for
ten
years
and
in
a
short
time
the
baron
of
peddlington
was
in
full
charge
of
the
domestic
arrangements
of
his
friend
it
was
far
from
easy
the
work
that
devolved
upon
him
he
was
a
proud
haughty
man
used
to
luxury
of
every
sort
to
whom
contact
with
those
who
serve
was
truly
distasteful
to
whom
the
necessity
of
himself
serving
was
most
galling
but
he
had
the
manliness
to
face
the
hardships
fate
had
put
upon
him
particularly
when
he
realized
that
baron
bangletop
attitude
towards
servants
was
such
that
he
could
with
impunity
impose
on
the
latter
seven
indignities
for
every
one
that
was
imposed
on
him
misery
loves
company
particularly
when
she
is
herself
the
hostess
and
can
give
generously
of
her
stores
to
others
desiring
to
retrieve
his
fallen
fortunes
the
baron
of
peddlington
offered
large
salaries
to
those
whom
he
employed
to
serve
in
the
bangletop
menage
and
on
payday
through
an
ingenious
system
of
fines
managed
to
retain
almost
per
cent
of
the
funds
for
his
own
use
of
this
baron
bangletop
of
course
could
know
nothing
he
was
aware
that
under
de
herbert
the
running
expenses
of
his
household
were
nearly
twice
what
they
had
been
under
the
dusky
duke
of
algeria
but
he
also
observed
that
repairs
to
the
property
for
which
the
late
duke
had
annually
paid
out
several
thousands
of
pounds
sterling
with
very
little
to
show
for
it
now
cost
him
as
many
hundreds
with
no
fewer
tangible
results
so
he
winked
his
eye
the
only
unaristocratic
habit
he
had
and
said
nothing
the
revenue
was
large
enough
he
had
been
known
to
say
to
support
himself
and
all
his
relatives
in
state
with
enough
left
over
to
satisfy
even
ali
baba
and
the
forty
thieves
had
he
foreseen
the
results
of
his
complacency
in
financial
matters
i
doubt
if
he
would
have
persisted
therein
for
some
ten
years
under
de
herbert
management
everything
went
smoothly
and
expensively
for
the
bangletop
hall
people
and
then
there
came
a
change
the
baron
bangletop
rang
for
his
breakfast
one
morning
and
his
breakfast
was
not
the
cook
had
disappeared
whither
or
why
she
had
gone
the
private
secretary
professed
to
be
unable
to
say
that
she
could
easily
be
replaced
he
was
certain
equally
certain
was
it
that
baron
bangletop
stormed
and
raved
for
two
hours
ate
a
cold
breakfast
a
thing
he
never
had
been
known
to
do
before
and
then
departed
for
london
to
dine
at
the
club
until
peddlington
had
secured
a
successor
to
the
departed
cook
which
the
private
secretary
succeeded
in
doing
within
three
days
the
baron
was
informed
of
his
manager
success
and
at
the
end
of
a
week
returned
to
bangletop
hall
arriving
there
late
on
a
saturday
night
hungry
as
a
bear
and
not
too
amiable
the
king
having
negotiated
a
forcible
loan
with
him
during
his
sojourn
in
the
metropolis
welcome
to
bangletop
baron
said
de
herbert
uneasily
as
his
employer
alighted
from
his
coach
blast
your
welcome
and
serve
the
dinner
returned
the
baron
with
a
somewhat
ill
grace
at
this
the
private
secretary
seemed
much
embarrassed
ahem
he
said
i
be
very
glad
to
have
the
dinner
served
my
dear
baron
but
the
fact
is
i
er
i
have
been
unable
to
provide
anything
but
canned
lobster
and
apples
illustration
what
in
the
name
of
chaucer
does
this
mean
roared
bangletop
who
was
a
great
admirer
of
the
father
of
english
poetry
chiefly
because
as
he
was
wont
to
say
chaucer
showed
that
a
bad
speller
could
be
a
great
man
which
was
a
condition
of
affairs
exactly
suited
to
his
mind
since
in
the
science
of
orthography
he
was
weak
like
most
of
the
aristocrats
of
his
day
i
thought
you
sent
me
word
you
had
a
cook
yes
baron
i
did
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
sir
she
left
us
last
night
or
rather
early
this
morning
another
one
of
your
beautiful
parisian
exits
i
presume
sneered
the
baron
tapping
the
floor
angrily
with
his
toe
well
yes
somewhat
so
only
she
got
her
money
first
money
shrieked
the
baron
money
why
in
liverpool
did
she
get
her
money
what
did
we
owe
her
money
for
rent
no
baron
for
services
she
cooked
three
dinners
well
you
pay
the
bill
out
of
your
perquisites
that
all
she
done
no
cooking
for
me
and
she
gets
no
pay
from
me
why
do
you
think
she
left
she
said
never
mind
what
she
said
sir
cried
bangletop
cutting
de
herbert
short
when
i
am
interested
in
the
of
cooks
i
let
you
know
what
i
wish
to
hear
is
what
do
think
was
the
cause
of
her
leaving
i
have
no
opinion
on
the
subject
replied
the
private
secretary
with
becoming
dignity
i
only
know
that
at
four
this
morning
she
knocked
at
my
door
and
demanded
her
wages
for
four
days
and
vowed
stay
no
longer
in
the
house
and
why
pray
did
you
not
inform
me
of
the
fact
instead
of
having
me
travel
away
down
here
from
london
queried
bangletop
you
forget
baron
replied
de
herbert
with
a
deprecatory
gesture
you
forget
that
there
is
no
system
of
telegraphy
by
which
you
could
be
reached
i
may
be
poor
sir
but
i
just
as
much
of
a
baron
as
you
are
and
i
will
take
the
liberty
of
saying
right
here
in
what
would
be
the
shadow
of
your
beard
if
you
had
one
sir
that
a
man
who
insists
on
receiving
cable
messages
when
no
such
things
exist
is
rather
rushing
business
pardon
my
haste
peddlington
old
chap
returned
the
baron
softening
you
are
quite
right
my
desire
was
unreasonable
but
i
swear
to
you
by
all
my
ancestral
bangletops
that
i
am
hungry
as
a
pit
full
of
bears
and
if
there
one
thing
i
ca
eat
it
is
lobster
and
apples
ca
you
scare
up
a
snack
of
bread
and
cheese
and
a
little
cold
larded
fillet
if
you
supply
the
fillet
i
provide
the
cold
at
this
sally
the
baron
of
peddlington
laughed
and
the
quarrel
was
over
but
none
the
less
the
master
of
bangletop
went
to
bed
hungry
nor
could
he
do
any
better
in
the
morning
at
the
butler
had
not
been
trained
to
cook
and
the
coachman
art
had
once
been
tried
on
a
boiled
egg
which
no
one
had
been
able
to
open
much
less
eat
and
as
it
was
the
sunday
off
there
was
absolutely
no
one
in
the
house
who
could
prepare
a
meal
the
baron
of
bangletop
had
a
sort
of
sneaking
notion
that
if
there
were
nobody
around
he
could
have
managed
the
spit
or
gridiron
himself
but
of
course
in
view
of
his
position
he
could
not
make
the
attempt
and
so
he
once
more
returned
to
london
and
vowed
never
to
set
his
foot
within
the
walls
of
bangletop
hall
again
until
his
ancestral
home
was
provided
with
a
cook
and
riveted
to
her
position
and
bangletop
hall
from
that
time
was
as
a
place
deserted
the
baron
never
returned
because
he
could
not
return
without
violating
his
oath
for
de
herbert
was
not
able
to
obtain
a
cook
for
the
bangletop
cuisine
who
would
stay
nor
was
any
one
able
to
discover
why
cook
after
cook
came
stayed
a
day
a
week
and
one
or
two
held
on
for
two
weeks
but
never
longer
their
course
was
invariably
the
same
they
would
leave
without
notice
nor
could
any
inducement
be
offered
which
would
persuade
them
to
remain
the
baron
of
peddlington
became
first
then
deaf
and
then
insane
in
his
search
for
a
permanent
cook
landing
finally
in
an
asylum
where
he
died
four
years
after
the
demise
of
his
employer
in
london
of
softening
of
the
brain
his
last
words
were
why
did
you
leave
your
last
place
illustration
and
so
time
went
on
barons
of
bangletop
were
born
educated
and
died
dynasties
rose
and
fell
but
bangletop
hall
remained
uninhabited
although
it
was
not
until
that
the
family
gave
up
all
hopes
of
being
able
to
use
their
ancestral
home
tremendous
alterations
as
i
have
already
hinted
were
made
the
drainage
was
carefully
inspected
and
a
special
apartment
connected
with
the
kitchen
finished
in
hardwood
handsomely
decorated
and
hung
with
rich
tapestries
was
provided
for
the
cook
in
the
vain
hope
that
she
might
be
induced
permanently
to
occupy
her
position
the
queen
anne
wing
and
elizabethan
ell
were
constructed
the
latter
to
provide
and
for
the
probable
cousins
of
possible
culinary
queens
and
many
there
were
who
accepted
the
office
with
alacrity
throwing
it
up
with
still
greater
alacrity
before
the
usual
fortnight
passed
then
the
bangletops
saw
clearly
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
live
there
and
moving
away
the
house
was
announced
to
be
for
rent
with
all
modern
improvements
conveniently
located
spacious
grounds
especially
adapted
to
the
use
of
those
who
do
their
own
cooking
the
last
clause
of
the
announcement
puzzled
a
great
many
people
who
went
to
see
the
mansion
for
no
other
reason
than
to
ascertain
just
what
the
announcement
meant
and
the
line
which
was
inserted
in
a
pure
spirit
of
facetious
bravado
was
probably
the
cause
of
the
mansion
quickly
renting
as
hardly
a
month
had
passed
before
it
was
leased
for
one
year
by
a
retired
london
brewer
whose
wife
curiosity
had
been
so
excited
by
the
strange
wording
of
the
advertisement
that
she
travelled
out
to
bangletop
to
gratify
it
fell
in
love
with
the
place
and
insisted
upon
her
husband
taking
it
for
a
season
the
luck
of
the
brewer
and
his
wife
was
no
better
than
that
of
the
bangletops
their
cooks
and
they
had
fourteen
during
their
stay
there
fled
after
an
average
service
of
four
days
apiece
and
later
the
tenants
themselves
were
forced
to
give
up
and
return
to
london
where
they
told
their
friends
that
the
was
which
might
have
filled
the
bangletops
with
concern
had
they
heard
of
it
they
did
not
hear
of
it
however
for
they
and
their
friends
did
not
know
the
brewer
and
the
brewer
friends
and
as
for
complaining
to
the
bangletop
agent
in
the
matter
the
worthy
thought
he
would
better
not
do
that
because
he
had
hopes
of
being
knighted
some
day
and
he
did
not
wish
to
antagonize
so
illustrious
a
family
as
the
bangletops
by
running
down
their
famous
hall
an
antagonism
which
might
materially
affect
the
chances
of
himself
and
his
good
wife
when
they
came
to
knock
at
the
doors
of
london
society
the
lease
was
allowed
to
run
its
course
the
rent
was
paid
when
due
and
at
the
end
of
the
stipulated
term
bangletop
hall
was
once
more
on
the
lists
as
for
rent
ii
for
fourscore
years
and
ten
did
the
same
hard
fortune
pursue
the
owners
of
bangletop
additions
to
the
property
were
made
immediately
upon
request
of
possible
lessees
the
greek
chapel
was
constructed
in
at
the
mere
suggestion
of
a
hellenic
prince
who
came
to
england
to
write
a
history
of
the
american
rebellion
finding
the
information
in
back
files
of
british
newspapers
exactly
suited
to
the
purposes
of
picturesque
narrative
and
no
more
misleading
than
most
history
bangletop
was
retired
far
from
the
gadding
crowd
as
the
prince
put
it
and
therefore
just
the
place
in
which
a
historian
of
the
romantic
school
might
produce
his
without
disturbance
the
only
objection
being
that
there
was
no
place
whither
the
eminently
christian
sojourner
could
go
to
worship
according
to
his
faith
he
being
a
communicant
in
the
greek
church
this
defect
baron
bangletop
immediately
remedied
by
erecting
and
endowing
the
chapel
and
his
youngest
son
having
been
found
too
delicate
morally
for
the
army
was
appointed
to
the
living
and
placed
in
charge
of
the
chapel
having
first
embraced
with
considerable
ardor
the
faith
upon
which
the
soul
of
the
princely
tenant
was
wont
to
feed
all
of
these
improvements
chapel
priest
the
latter
change
of
faith
and
all
the
bangletop
agent
put
at
the
exceedingly
low
sum
of
guineas
per
annum
and
board
for
the
priest
an
offer
which
the
prince
at
once
accepted
stipulating
however
that
the
lease
should
be
terminable
at
any
time
he
or
his
landlord
should
see
fit
against
this
the
agent
fought
nobly
but
without
avail
the
prince
had
heard
rumors
about
the
cooks
of
bangletop
and
he
was
wary
finally
the
stipulation
was
accepted
by
the
baron
with
what
result
the
reader
need
hardly
be
told
the
prince
stayed
two
weeks
listened
to
one
sermon
in
classic
university
greek
by
the
youthful
bangletop
was
deserted
by
his
cook
and
moved
away
after
the
departure
of
the
prince
the
estate
was
neglected
for
nearly
years
the
owner
having
made
up
his
mind
that
the
case
was
hopeless
at
the
end
of
that
period
there
came
from
the
united
states
a
wealthy
shoemaker
hankinson
terwilliger
by
name
chief
owner
of
the
terwilliger
shoe
company
limited
of
soleton
massachusetts
and
to
him
was
leased
bangletop
hall
with
all
its
rights
and
appurtenances
for
a
term
of
five
years
terwilliger
was
the
first
applicant
for
the
hall
as
a
dwelling
to
whom
the
agent
at
the
instance
of
the
baron
spoke
in
a
spirit
of
absolute
candor
the
baron
was
well
on
in
years
and
he
did
not
feel
like
getting
into
trouble
with
a
yankee
so
he
said
at
his
time
of
life
the
hall
had
been
a
thorn
in
his
flesh
all
his
days
and
he
did
care
if
it
was
never
occupied
and
therefore
he
wished
nothing
concealed
from
a
prospective
tenant
it
was
the
agent
candor
more
than
anything
else
that
induced
terwilliger
to
close
with
him
for
the
term
of
five
years
he
suspected
that
the
bangletops
did
not
want
him
for
a
tenant
and
from
the
moment
that
notion
entered
his
head
he
was
resolved
that
he
would
be
a
tenant
i
as
good
a
man
as
any
baron
that
ever
lived
he
said
and
if
it
pleases
hankinson
terwilliger
to
live
in
a
baronial
hall
a
baronial
hall
is
where
hankinson
terwilliger
puts
up
we
certainly
have
none
of
the
feeling
which
your
words
seem
to
attribute
to
us
my
dear
sir
the
agent
had
answered
baron
bangletop
would
feel
highly
honored
to
have
so
distinguished
a
sojourner
in
england
as
yourself
occupy
his
estate
but
he
does
not
wish
you
to
take
it
without
fully
understanding
the
circumstances
desirable
as
bangletop
hall
is
it
seems
fated
to
be
unoccupied
because
it
is
thought
to
be
haunted
or
something
of
that
sort
the
effect
of
which
is
to
drive
away
cooks
and
without
cooks
life
is
hardly
an
ideal
terwilliger
laughed
ghosts
and
me
are
not
afraid
of
each
other
he
said
haunt
i
say
and
as
for
cooks
has
had
a
liberal
education
for
nothing
we
could
live
if
all
the
cooks
in
creation
were
to
go
off
in
a
whiff
we
have
daughters
too
we
have
good
smart
american
girls
who
can
adorn
a
palace
or
grace
a
hut
on
demand
not
afraid
of
poverty
and
able
to
take
care
of
good
round
dollars
they
can
play
the
piano
all
the
morning
and
cook
dinner
all
the
afternoon
if
they
called
on
to
do
it
so
your
difficulties
ai
my
difficulties
i
take
the
hall
at
your
figures
term
five
years
and
if
the
come
down
and
spend
a
month
with
us
at
any
time
i
do
care
when
show
him
what
a
big
lap
luxury
can
get
up
when
she
tries
and
so
it
happened
the
new
york
papers
announced
that
hankinson
terwilliger
terwilliger
the
misses
terwilliger
and
master
hankinson
terwilliger
of
soleton
massachusetts
had
plunged
into
the
dizzy
whirl
of
english
society
and
that
the
sole
of
the
shoe
now
trod
the
baronial
halls
of
the
bangletops
later
it
was
announced
that
the
misses
terwilliger
of
bangletop
hall
had
been
presented
to
the
queen
that
the
terwilligers
had
entertained
the
prince
of
wales
at
bangletop
in
fact
the
terwilligers
became
an
important
factor
in
the
letters
of
all
foreign
correspondents
of
american
papers
for
the
president
of
the
terwilliger
shoe
company
of
soleton
massachusetts
limited
was
now
in
full
possession
of
the
historic
mansion
and
was
living
up
to
his
surroundings
for
a
time
everything
was
plain
sailing
for
the
americans
at
bangletop
the
dire
forebodings
of
the
agent
did
not
seem
to
be
fulfilled
and
terwilliger
was
beginning
to
feel
aggrieved
he
had
hired
a
house
with
a
ghost
and
he
wanted
the
use
of
it
but
when
he
reflected
upon
the
consequences
below
stairs
he
held
his
peace
he
was
not
so
sure
after
he
had
stayed
at
bangletop
awhile
and
had
had
his
daughters
presented
to
the
queen
that
he
could
be
so
independent
of
cooks
as
he
had
at
first
supposed
several
times
he
had
hinted
rather
broadly
that
some
of
the
old
new
england
homemade
would
be
most
pleasing
to
his
palate
but
since
the
prince
had
spent
an
afternoon
on
the
lawn
of
bangletop
the
young
ladies
seemed
deeply
pained
at
the
mere
mention
of
their
accomplishments
in
the
line
of
griddles
and
batter
nor
could
terwilliger
after
having
tasted
the
joys
of
aristocratic
life
bring
herself
to
don
the
apron
which
so
became
her
portly
person
in
the
early
american
days
and
prepare
for
her
lord
and
master
one
of
those
delicious
platters
of
poached
eggs
and
breakfast
bacon
the
mere
memory
of
which
made
his
mouth
water
in
short
palatial
surroundings
had
too
obviously
destroyed
in
his
wife
and
daughters
all
that
capacity
for
happiness
in
a
hovel
of
which
terwilliger
had
been
so
proud
and
concerning
which
he
had
so
eloquently
spoken
to
baron
bangletop
agent
and
he
now
found
himself
in
the
position
of
damocles
the
hall
was
leased
for
a
term
entertainment
had
been
provided
for
the
county
with
lavish
hand
but
success
was
dependent
entirely
upon
his
ability
to
keep
a
cook
his
family
having
departed
from
their
republican
principles
and
the
history
of
the
house
was
dead
against
a
successful
issue
so
he
decided
that
after
all
it
was
better
that
the
ghost
should
be
allowed
to
remain
quiescent
and
he
uttered
no
word
of
complaint
it
was
just
as
well
too
that
terwilliger
held
his
peace
and
refrained
from
addressing
a
complaining
missive
to
the
agent
of
bangletop
hall
for
before
a
message
of
that
nature
could
have
reached
the
person
addressed
its
contents
would
have
been
misleading
for
at
a
quarter
after
midnight
on
the
morning
of
the
date
set
for
the
first
of
a
series
of
grand
banquets
to
the
county
folk
there
came
from
the
kitchen
of
bangletop
hall
a
quick
succession
of
shrieks
that
sent
the
three
misses
terwilliger
into
hysterics
and
caused
hankinson
terwilliger
sole
remaining
lock
to
stand
erect
terwilliger
did
not
hear
the
shrieks
owing
to
a
lately
acquired
habit
of
hearing
nothing
that
proceeded
from
below
stairs
the
first
impulse
of
terwilliger
was
to
dive
down
under
the
bedclothes
and
endeavor
to
drown
the
fearful
sound
by
his
own
labored
breathing
but
he
never
yielded
to
first
impulses
so
he
awaited
the
second
which
came
simultaneously
with
a
second
series
of
shrieks
and
a
cry
for
help
in
the
unmistakable
voice
of
the
cook
a
lady
who
had
followed
the
terwilliger
fortunes
ever
since
the
terwilligers
began
to
have
fortunes
and
whose
first
capacity
in
the
family
had
been
the
dual
one
of
mistress
of
the
kitchen
and
confidante
of
madame
the
second
impulse
was
to
arise
in
his
might
put
on
a
stout
pair
of
the
terwilliger
brogans
the
strongest
shoe
made
having
been
especially
devised
for
the
british
infantry
in
the
soudan
and
garments
suitable
to
the
occasion
namely
a
mackintosh
and
pair
of
broadcloth
trousers
and
go
to
the
rescue
of
the
distressed
domestic
this
hankinson
terwilliger
at
once
proceeded
to
do
arming
himself
with
a
pair
of
murmuring
on
the
way
below
a
soft
prayer
the
only
one
he
knew
and
which
with
singular
inappropriateness
on
this
occasion
began
with
the
words
now
i
lay
me
down
to
sleep
what
the
matter
judson
queried
terwilliger
drowsily
as
she
opened
her
eyes
and
saw
her
husband
preparing
for
the
fray
she
no
longer
called
him
hankinson
not
because
she
did
not
think
it
a
good
name
nor
was
it
less
euphonious
to
her
ear
than
judson
but
judson
was
terwilliger
middle
name
and
middle
names
were
quite
the
thing
she
had
observed
in
the
best
circles
it
was
doubtless
due
to
this
discovery
that
her
visiting
cards
had
been
engraved
to
read
the
hyphen
presumably
being
a
typographical
error
for
which
the
engraver
was
responsible
illustration
matter
enough
growled
hankinson
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
that
jackass
of
a
ghost
is
on
duty
at
the
word
ghost
a
shriek
pervaded
the
atmosphere
and
terwilliger
forgetting
her
social
position
for
a
moment
groaned
oh
hank
and
swooned
away
and
then
the
president
of
the
terwilliger
shoe
company
of
soleton
massachusetts
limited
descended
to
the
kitchen
across
the
sill
of
the
kitchen
door
lay
the
culinary
treasure
whose
lobster
croquettes
the
prince
of
wales
had
likened
unto
a
dream
of
lucullus
within
the
kitchen
were
signs
of
disorder
chairs
were
upset
the
table
was
lying
flat
on
its
back
with
its
four
legs
held
rigidly
up
in
the
air
the
kitchen
library
consisting
of
a
copy
of
antoinette
a
novel
bearing
the
title
lucy
or
the
who
became
a
and
soups
by
one
who
lay
strewn
about
the
room
the
sadly
torn
and
disfigured
forever
with
batter
even
to
the
unpractised
eye
it
was
evident
that
something
had
happened
and
terwilliger
felt
a
cold
chill
mounting
his
spine
three
sections
at
a
time
whether
it
was
the
chill
or
his
concern
for
the
prostrate
cook
that
was
responsible
or
not
i
can
not
say
but
for
some
cause
or
other
terwilliger
immediately
got
down
on
his
knees
in
which
position
he
gazed
fearfully
about
him
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
timidly
remarked
cook
there
was
no
answer
mary
i
say
cook
he
whispered
what
the
deuce
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
illustration
a
low
moan
was
all
that
came
from
the
cook
nor
would
hankinson
have
listened
to
more
had
there
been
more
to
hear
for
simultaneously
with
the
moan
he
became
uncomfortably
conscious
of
a
presence
in
trying
to
describe
it
afterwards
hankinson
said
that
at
first
he
thought
a
cold
draught
from
a
dank
cavern
filled
with
a
million
eels
and
a
rattlesnake
or
two
thrown
in
for
luck
was
blowing
over
him
and
he
avowed
that
it
was
anything
but
pleasant
and
then
it
seemed
to
change
into
a
mist
drawn
largely
from
a
stagnant
pool
in
a
malarial
country
floating
through
which
were
great
quantities
of
finely
chopped
wet
hair
and
an
indescribable
atmosphere
of
something
the
chief
quality
of
which
was
a
sort
of
stale
clamminess
that
was
awful
in
its
intensity
i
glad
terwilliger
murmured
to
himself
that
i
ai
one
of
those
delicately
reared
nobles
if
i
had
anything
less
than
a
regular
republican
constitution
i
die
of
fright
and
then
his
natural
grit
came
to
his
rescue
and
it
was
well
it
did
for
the
presence
had
assumed
shape
and
now
sat
on
the
in
the
form
of
a
hag
glaring
at
him
from
out
of
the
depths
of
her
unfathomable
eyes
in
which
despite
their
deadly
greenness
there
lurked
a
tinge
of
red
caused
by
small
specks
of
that
hue
semioccasionally
seen
floating
across
her
dilated
pupils
you
are
the
bangletop
ghost
i
presume
said
terwilliger
rising
and
standing
near
the
fire
to
thaw
out
his
system
the
spectre
made
no
reply
but
pointed
to
the
door
yes
terwilliger
said
as
if
answering
a
question
that
the
way
out
madame
it
a
beautiful
exit
too
just
try
it
knows
the
wi
out
returned
the
spectre
rising
and
approaching
the
tenant
of
bangletop
whose
solitary
lock
also
rose
being
too
polite
to
remain
seated
while
the
ghost
walked
also
knows
the
wi
in
judson
terwilliger
that
very
evident
madame
and
between
you
and
me
i
wish
you
did
returned
hankinson
somewhat
relieved
to
hear
the
ghost
talk
even
if
her
voice
did
sound
like
the
roar
of
a
with
a
bad
case
of
grip
i
may
say
to
you
that
aside
from
a
certain
uncanny
satisfaction
which
i
feel
at
being
permitted
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
to
gaze
upon
the
linaments
of
a
real
live
misty
musty
spook
i
regard
your
coming
here
as
an
invasion
of
the
sacred
rights
of
privacy
which
is
as
you
might
say
illustration
hinvaision
retorted
the
ghost
snapping
her
fingers
in
his
face
with
such
effect
that
his
chin
dropped
until
terwilliger
began
to
fear
it
might
never
resume
its
normal
position
hinvaision
like
to
know
the
hinvaider
occupied
these
for
hover
two
years
then
it
time
you
moved
unless
perchance
you
are
the
ghost
of
a
mediaeval
porker
hankinson
said
his
calmness
returning
now
that
he
had
succeeded
in
plastering
his
lock
across
the
top
of
his
otherwise
bald
head
of
course
if
you
are
a
spook
of
that
kind
you
want
the
earth
and
maybe
you
get
it
no
porker
returned
the
spectre
simply
the
shide
of
a
poor
abused
cook
which
is
hafter
revenge
ah
ejaculated
terwilliger
raising
his
eyebrows
this
is
getting
interesting

spook

a
grievance

returned
terwilliger
with
a
smile
i
bet
you
are
an
old
fraud
of
a
modern
ghost
here
he
discharged
all
six
chambers
of
his
pistol
into
the
body
of
the
spectre
no
taikers
retorted
the
ghost
as
the
bullets
whistled
through
her
chest
and
struck
deep
into
the
wall
on
the
other
side
of
the
kitchen
that
a
noisy
gun
you

that

sent
off
with
three
months

the
ghost

then
replied
terwilliger
with
hinterest
compound
hinterest
at
six
per
for
two
and
thirty
years
said
the
ghost
phew
whistled
terwilliger
have
you
any
idea
how
much
money
that
is
certingly
replied
the
ghost
hit
just
pounds
shillings
pence
when
gets
that
flies
huntil
i
gets
it
stys
an
i
say
said
terwilliger
have
you
been
chumming
with
an
italian
ghost
named
shylock
over
on
the
other
shore
shylock
said
the
ghost
no
never
the
naime
perhaps
stoppin
at
the
hother
place
very
likely
said
terwilliger
he
is
an
eminent
saint
alongside
of
you
but
i
say
now
mrs
spook
or
whatever
your
name
is
this
is
rubbing
it
in
to
try
to
collect
as
much
money
as
that
particularly
from
me
who
was
to
blame
in
any
way
and
on
whom
you
have
the
spook
of
a
claim
very
sorry
for
you
terwilliger
said
the
ghost
but
my
vow
must
be
kept
sacrid
but
why
do
you
come
down
on
the
bangletops
up
in
london
and
squeeze
it
out
of
them
car
bound
to
this
an
that
hall
there
is
about
it
car
find
a
better
wy
to
ly
them
baingletops
low
than
by
attachin
of
their
hincome
hand
the
rent
of
this
is
the
honly
bit
of
hincome
within
my
reach
but
i
leased
the
place
for
five
years
said
terwilliger
in
despair
and
i
paid
the
rent
in
advance
car
it
returned
the
ghost
hif
you
did
that
hit
your
own
fault
i
would
have
done
it
except
to
advertise
my
shoe
business
said
terwilliger
ruefully
the
items
in
the
papers
at
home
that
arise
from
my
occupancy
of
this
house
together
with
the
social
cinch
it
gives
me
are
worth
the
money
but
i
hanged
if
it
worth
my
while
to
pay
back
salaries
to
every
grasping
apparition
that
chooses
to
rise
up
out
of
the
moat
and
dip
his
or
her
clammy
hand
into
my
surplus
the
shoe
trade
is
a
blooming
big
thing
but
the
profits
are
big
enough
to
divide
with
tramp
ghosts
your
tone
is
very
terwilliger
but
it
do
haffeck
me
do
care
pys
the
money
an
got
you
into
this
scripe
you
done
that
yourself
hon
the
other
sir
showed
you
to
get
out
of
it
well
perhaps
you
right
returned
hankinson
i
ca
say
i
blame
you
for
not
perjuring
yourself
particularly
since
you
been
dead
long
enough
to
have
discovered
what
the
probable
consequences
would
be
but
i
do
wish
there
was
some
other
way
out
of
it
could
pay
you
all
that
money
without
losing
a
controlling
interest
in
the
shoe
company
and
that
hardly
worth
my
while
now
is
it
no
terwilliger
hit
is
not
i
have
a
scheme
said
hankinson
after
a
moment
or
two
of
deep
thought
why
do
you
go
back
to
the
spirit
world
and
expose
the
bangletops
there
they
have
spooks
have
they
yes
replied
the
ghost
sadly
but
the
spirit
world
his
as
bad
as
this
the
spook
of
a
cook
car
reach
the
spook
of
a
baron
there
hany
more
than
a
can
reach
a
markis
tried
that
when
the
baron
died
and
came
over
to
the
hother
world
but
spook
flunkies
on
to
tell
me
was
hout
drivin
with
the
ghost
of
william
the
conqueror
and
the
shide
of
solomon
knew
was
but
what
could
do
it
was
a
mean
game
of
bluff
said
terwilliger
i
suppose
though
if
you
were
the
shade
of
a
duchess
you
could
simply
knock
bangletop
silly
yes
and
the
baron
of
peddlington
too
was
the
private
secretary
as
said
the
big
h
said
terwilliger
meditatively
would
you
er
would
you
consent
to
retire
from
this
haunting
business
of
yours
and
give
me
a
receipt
for
that
bill
for
wages
interest
and
all
if
i
had
you
made
over
into
the
spook
of
a
duchess
revenge
is
sweet
you
know
and
there
are
some
revenges
that
are
simply
a
thousand
times
more
balmy
than
riches
would
ejaculated
the
ghost
rising
and
looking
at
the
clock
would
she
repeated
well
rather
if
could
enter
spook
society
as
a
duchess
you
can
wager
a
year
hincome
them
bangletops
would
be
hin
it
good
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
are
a
spook
of
spirit
if
you
had
veins
i
believe
there
be
sporting
blood
in
them
thainks
said
the
ghost
dryly
but
can
it
hever
be
did
leave
that
to
me
terwilliger
answered
we
call
a
truce
for
two
weeks
at
the
end
of
which
time
you
must
come
back
here
and
we
settle
on
the
final
arrangements
keep
your
own
counsel
in
the
matter
and
breathe
a
word
about
your
intentions
to
anybody
above
all
keep
sober
no
cannibal
retorted
the
ghost
who
said
you
were
asked
terwilliger
you
intimated
as
much
said
the
ghost
with
a
smile
you
said
as
i
must
keep
sober
and
could
i
do
hotherwise
hunless
i
swallered
some
spirits
terwilliger
laughed
he
thought
it
was
a
pretty
good
joke
for
a
ghost
especially
a
cook
ghost
and
then
having
agreed
on
the
hour
of
midnight
one
fortnight
thence
for
the
next
meeting
they
shook
hands
and
parted
what
was
it
hankinson
asked
terwilliger
as
her
husband
crawled
back
into
bed
burglars
not
a
burglar
returned
hankinson
nothing
but
a
ghost
a
poor
old
female
ghost
ghost
cried
terwilliger
trembling
with
fright
in
this
house
yes
my
dear
haunted
us
by
mistake
that
all
belongs
to
another
place
entirely
got
a
little
befogged
and
came
here
without
intending
to
that
all
when
she
found
out
her
mistake
she
apologized
and
left
illustration
what
did
she
have
on
asked
terwilliger
with
a
sigh
of
relief
but
the
president
of
the
shoe
company
of
soleton
massachusetts
limited
said
nothing
he
had
dropped
off
into
a
profound
slumber
iii
for
the
next
two
weeks
terwilliger
lived
in
a
state
of
preoccupation
that
worried
his
wife
and
daughters
to
a
very
considerable
extent
they
were
afraid
that
something
had
happened
or
was
about
to
happen
in
connection
with
the
shoe
corporation
and
this
deprived
them
of
sleep
particularly
the
elder
miss
terwilliger
who
had
danced
four
times
at
a
recent
ball
with
an
impecunious
young
earl
whom
she
suspected
of
having
intentions
ariadne
was
in
a
state
of
grave
apprehension
because
she
knew
that
much
as
the
earl
might
love
her
it
would
be
difficult
for
them
to
marry
on
his
income
which
was
literally
too
small
to
keep
the
roof
over
his
head
in
decent
repair
but
it
was
not
business
troubles
that
occupied
every
sleeping
and
waking
thought
of
hankinson
judson
terwilliger
his
mind
was
now
set
upon
the
hardest
problem
it
had
ever
had
to
cope
with
that
problem
being
how
to
so
ennoble
the
spectre
cook
of
bangletop
that
she
might
outrank
the
ancestors
of
his
landlord
in
the
other
world
the
shady
world
he
called
it
the
living
cook
had
been
induced
to
remain
partly
by
threats
and
partly
by
promises
of
increased
pay
the
threats
consisting
largely
of
expressions
of
determination
to
leave
her
in
england
thousands
of
miles
from
her
home
in
massachusetts
deserted
and
forlorn
the
poor
woman
being
insufficiently
provided
with
funds
to
get
back
to
america
and
holding
in
her
veins
a
strain
of
celtic
blood
quite
large
enough
to
make
the
idea
of
remaining
an
outcast
in
england
absolutely
intolerable
to
her
at
the
end
of
seven
days
terwilliger
was
seemingly
as
far
from
the
solution
of
his
problem
as
ever
and
at
the
grand
fete
given
by
himself
and
wife
on
the
afternoon
of
the
seventh
day
of
his
trial
to
the
earl
of
mugley
the
one
in
whom
ariadne
was
interested
he
seemed
almost
rude
to
his
guests
which
the
latter
overlooked
taking
it
for
the
american
way
of
entertaining
it
is
very
hard
for
a
shoemaker
to
entertain
earls
dukes
and
the
plainest
kind
of
lords
under
ordinary
circumstances
but
when
in
addition
to
the
duties
of
host
the
maker
of
soles
has
to
think
out
a
recipe
for
the
making
of
an
aristocrat
out
of
a
deceased
plebe
a
polite
manner
is
hardly
to
be
expected
terwilliger
manner
remained
of
the
kind
to
be
expected
under
the
circumstances
neither
better
nor
worse
until
the
flunky
at
the
door
announced
in
stentorian
tones
the
hearl
of
mugley
the
hearl
of
mugley
seemed
to
be
the
open
sesame
to
the
door
betwixt
terwilliger
and
success
simultaneously
with
the
entrance
of
the
earl
the
solution
of
his
problem
flashed
across
the
mind
of
the
master
of
bangletop
and
his
affronting
demeanor
his
preoccupation
and
all
disappeared
in
an
instant
indeed
so
elegantly
enthusiastic
was
his
reception
of
the
earl
that
lady
maud
sniffles
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
whispered
in
the
ear
of
the
hon
miss
pottleton
that
creditors
were
in
luck
to
which
the
hon
miss
pottleton
whose
smiles
upon
the
nobleman
had
been
returned
unopened
curved
her
upper
lip
spitefully
and
replied
that
they
were
indeed
but
she
did
envy
ariadne
that
pompous
little
error
of
nature
the
earl
howdy
do
earl
said
terwilliger
glad
to
see
you
looking
so
well
how
your
mamma
the
countess
is
in
her
usual
state
of
health
terwilliger
returned
the
earl
ai
she
coming
this
afternoon
i
really
ca
say
answered
mugley
i
asked
her
if
she
was
coming
and
all
she
did
was
to
call
for
her
salts
she
a
little
given
to
and
the
slightest
shock
rather
upsets
her
and
then
the
earl
turned
on
his
heel
and
sought
out
the
fair
ariadne
while
terwilliger
excusing
himself
left
the
assemblage
and
went
directly
to
his
private
office
in
the
crypt
of
the
greek
chapel
arrived
there
he
seated
himself
at
his
desk
and
wrote
the
following
formal
card
which
he
put
in
an
envelope
and
addressed
to
the
earl
of
mugley
illustration
if
the
earl
of
mugley
will
call
at
the
private
office
of
judson
terwilliger
at
once
he
will
not
only
greatly
oblige
judson
terwilliger
but
may
also
hear
of
something
to
his
advantage
the
card
written
terwilliger
summoned
an
attendant
ordered
a
quantity
of
liqueurs
whiskey
sherry
port
and
lemon
squash
for
two
to
be
brought
to
the
office
and
then
sent
his
communication
to
the
earl
now
the
earl
was
a
great
stickler
for
etiquette
and
he
did
not
at
all
like
the
idea
of
one
in
his
position
waiting
upon
one
of
rank
or
lack
of
rank
and
at
first
thought
he
was
inclined
to
ignore
the
request
of
his
host
but
a
combination
of
circumstances
served
to
change
his
resolution
he
so
seldom
heard
anything
to
his
advantage
that
for
mere
novelty
sake
he
thought
he
would
do
as
he
was
asked
but
the
question
of
his
dignity
rose
up
again
and
shoving
the
note
into
his
pocket
he
tried
to
forget
it
after
five
minutes
he
found
he
could
not
forget
it
and
putting
his
hand
into
the
pocket
for
the
missive
meaning
to
give
it
a
second
reading
he
drew
out
another
paper
by
mistake
which
was
in
brief
a
reminder
from
a
firm
of
london
lawyers
that
he
owed
certain
clients
of
theirs
a
few
thousands
of
pounds
for
the
clothing
that
had
adorned
his
back
for
the
last
two
years
and
stating
that
proceedings
would
be
begun
if
at
the
expiration
of
three
months
the
account
was
not
paid
in
full
the
reminder
settled
it
the
earl
of
mugley
graciously
concluded
to
grant
judson
terwilliger
an
audience
in
the
private
office
under
the
greek
chapel
sit
down
earl
and
have
a
cream
de
mint
with
me
said
terwilliger
as
the
earl
four
minutes
later
entered
the
apartment
thanks
returned
the
earl
beautiful
color
that
he
added
pleasantly
smacking
his
lips
with
satisfaction
as
the
soft
green
fluid
disappeared
from
the
glass
into
his
inner
earl
fine
said
terwilliger
little
unripe
perhaps
but
pleasant
to
the
eye
i
prefer
the
hue
of
the
maraschino
myself
just
taste
that
maraschino
earl
it
dollars
a
case
you
wanted
to
see
me
about
some
matter
of
interest
to
both
of
us
i
believe
terwilliger
said
the
earl
declining
the
proffered
maraschino
well
yes
returned
terwilliger
more
of
interest
to
you
perhaps
than
to
me
the
fact
is
earl
i
taken
quite
a
shine
to
you
so
much
of
a
one
in
fact
that
i
looked
you
up
at
a
commercial
agency
and
terwilliger
never
does
that
unless
he
mightily
interested
in
a
man
i
er
i
hope
you
are
not
to
be
prejudiced
against
me
the
earl
said
uneasily
by
er
by
what
those
cads
of
tradesmen
say
about
me
not
a
bit
returned
terwilliger
not
a
bit
in
fact
what
discovered
has
prejudiced
me
in
your
favor
you
are
just
the
man
i
been
looking
for
for
some
days
i
wanted
a
man
with
three
a
blood
and
three
z
finances
for
a
week
now
and
from
what
i
gather
from
burke
and
bradstreet
you
fill
the
bill
you
owe
pretty
much
everybody
from
your
tailor
to
the
collector
of
pew
rents
at
your
church
eh
i
been
unfortunate
in
financial
matters
returned
the
earl
but
i
have
left
the
family
name
untarnished
so
i
believe
earl
that
what
i
admire
about
you
some
men
with
your
debts
would
be
driven
to
drink
or
other
pastimes
of
a
more
or
less
tarnishing
nature
and
i
admire
you
for
the
admirable
restraint
you
have
put
upon
yourself
you
owe
i
am
told
about
thousand
pounds
my
secretary
has
the
figures
i
believe
said
the
earl
slightly
bored
well
we
say
thirty
thousand
in
round
figures
now
what
hope
have
you
of
ever
paying
that
sum
off
none
unless
i
er
well
unless
i
should
be
fortunate
enough
to
secure
a
rich
wife
precisely
that
is
exactly
what
i
thought
rejoined
terwilliger
marriage
is
your
only
asset
and
as
yet
that
is
hardly
negotiable
now
i
have
called
you
here
this
afternoon
to
make
a
proposition
to
you
if
you
will
marry
according
to
my
wishes
i
will
give
you
an
income
of
five
thousand
pounds
a
year
for
the
next
five
years
i
do
quite
understand
you
the
earl
replied
in
a
disappointed
tone
it
was
evident
that
five
thousand
pounds
per
annum
was
too
small
a
figure
for
his
tastes
i
think
i
was
quite
plain
said
terwilliger
and
he
repeated
his
offer
i
certainly
admire
the
lady
very
much
said
the
earl
but
the
settlement
of
income
seems
very
small
terwilliger
opened
his
eyes
wide
with
astonishment
oh
you
admire
the
lady
eh
he
said
well
there
is
no
accounting
for
tastes
you
surprise
me
slightly
said
the
earl
in
response
to
this
remark
the
lady
is
certainly
worthy
of
any
man
admiration
she
is
refined
cultivated
beautiful
and
ahem
said
terwilliger
may
i
ask
my
dear
earl
to
whom
you
refer
to
ariadne
of
course
i
thought
your
course
somewhat
unusual
but
we
do
not
pretend
to
comprehend
you
americans
over
here
your
proposition
is
that
i
shall
marry
ariadne
i
hesitate
to
place
on
record
what
terwilliger
said
in
answer
to
this
statement
it
was
forcible
rather
than
polite
and
the
earl
from
that
moment
adopted
a
new
simile
for
degrees
of
profanity
substituting
to
swear
like
an
american
for
the
old
forms
having
to
do
with
pirates
and
troopers
the
string
of
expletives
was
about
five
minutes
in
length
at
the
end
of
which
time
terwilliger
managed
to
say
no
such
d
proposition
ever
entered
my
mind
i
want
you
to
marry
a
cold
misty
musty
spectre
nothing
more
or
less
and
i
tell
you
why
and
then
he
proceeded
to
tell
the
earl
of
mugley
all
that
he
knew
of
the
history
of
bangletop
hall
concluding
with
a
narration
of
his
experiences
with
the
ghost
cook
my
rent
here
he
said
in
conclusion
is
five
thousand
pounds
per
annum
the
advertising
i
get
out
of
the
fact
of
my
being
here
and
swelling
it
with
you
nabobs
is
worth
thousand
pounds
a
year
and
willing
to
pay
in
good
hard
cash
twenty
per
cent
of
that
amount
rather
than
be
forced
to
give
up
now
here
your
chance
to
get
an
income
without
an
encumbrance
and
stave
off
your
creditors
marry
the
spook
so
that
she
can
go
back
to
the
spirit
land
a
countess
and
make
it
hot
for
the
bangletops
and
do
be
so
allfired
proud
she
be
disappointed
enough
i
can
tell
you
when
i
inform
her
that
an
earl
was
the
best
i
could
do
the
promised
duke
not
being
within
reach
if
she
says
earls
are
drugs
in
the
market
i
wo
be
able
to
deny
it
and
after
all
my
lad
a
good
cook
is
a
greater
blessing
in
this
world
than
any
earl
that
ever
lived
and
a
blamed
sight
rarer
illustration
your
proposition
is
absolutely
ridiculous
terwilliger
replied
the
earl
i
look
well
marrying
a
draught
from
a
dark
cavern
as
you
call
it
now
would
i
to
say
nothing
of
the
impossibility
of
a
mugley
marrying
a
cook
i
can
not
entertain
the
proposition
you
find
you
ca
entertain
anything
if
you
do
watch
out
fumed
terwilliger
in
return
i
not
so
sure
about
that
replied
the
earl
haughtily
sipping
his
lemon
squash
i
fancy
miss
ariadne
is
not
entirely
indifferent
to
me
well
you
might
just
as
well
understand
on
this
day
of
july
as
any
other
time
that
my
daughter
ariadne
never
becomes
the
earless
of
mugley
said
terwilliger
in
a
tone
of
exasperation
not
even
when
her
father
considers
the
commercial
value
of
such
an
alliance
for
his
daughter
retorted
the
earl
shaking
his
finger
in
terwilliger
face
not
even
when
the
president
of
the
shoe
company
of
soleton
massachusetts
limited
considers
the
advertising
sure
to
result
from
a
marriage
between
his
house
and
that
of
mugley
with
presents
from
her
majesty
the
queen
the
duke
of
york
acting
as
best
man
and
telegrams
of
congratulation
from
the
crowned
heads
of
europe
pouring
in
at
the
rate
of
two
an
hour
for
half
as
many
hours
as
there
are
thrones
terwilliger
turned
pale
the
picture
painted
by
the
earl
was
terribly
alluring
he
hesitated
he
was
lost
mugley
he
whispered
hoarsely
mugley
i
have
wronged
you
i
thought
you
were
a
i
see
you
love
her
take
her
my
boy
and
pass
me
the
brandy
certainly
terwilliger
replied
the
earl
affably
and
then
if
you
no
objection
you
may
pass
it
back
and
i
join
you
in
a
thimbleful
myself
and
then
the
two
men
drank
each
other
health
in
silence
which
was
prolonged
for
at
least
five
minutes
during
which
time
the
earl
and
his
host
both
appeared
to
be
immersed
in
deep
thought
come
said
terwilliger
at
last
let
us
go
back
to
the
or
they
miss
us
and
you
might
speak
of
that
little
matter
to
ariadne
it
help
the
fall
trade
to
have
the
engagement
announced
i
will
terwilliger
returned
the
earl
as
they
started
to
leave
the
room
but
i
say
elect
he
whispered
catching
terwilliger
coat
sleeve
and
drawing
him
back
into
the
office
for
an
instant
you
could
let
me
have
five
pounds
on
account
this
evening
could
you
two
minutes
later
terwilliger
and
the
earl
appeared
in
the
the
former
looking
haggard
and
worn
his
eyes
feverishly
bright
and
his
manner
betraying
the
presence
of
disturbing
elements
in
his
nerve
centres
the
latter
smiling
more
affably
than
was
consistent
with
his
title
and
jingling
a
number
of
gold
coins
in
his
pocket
which
his
intimate
friend
and
old
college
chum
lord
dufferton
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
marvelled
at
greatly
for
he
knew
well
that
upon
the
earl
arrival
at
bangletop
hall
an
hour
before
his
pockets
were
as
empty
as
a
head
iv
terwilliger
time
was
almost
up
the
hour
for
his
interview
with
the
spectre
cook
of
bangletop
was
hardly
hours
distant
and
he
was
wellnigh
distracted
no
solution
of
the
problem
seemed
possible
since
the
earl
had
so
peremptorily
declined
to
fall
in
with
his
plan
he
was
glad
the
earl
had
done
so
for
otherwise
he
would
have
been
denied
the
tremendous
satisfaction
which
the
consummation
of
an
alliance
between
his
own
and
one
of
the
oldest
and
noblest
houses
of
england
was
about
to
give
him
not
to
mention
the
commercial
phase
of
the
situation
which
had
been
so
potent
a
factor
in
bringing
the
engagement
about
for
ariadne
had
said
yes
to
the
earl
that
same
night
and
the
betrothal
was
shortly
to
be
announced
it
would
have
been
announced
at
once
only
the
earl
felt
that
he
should
break
the
news
himself
first
to
his
mother
the
countess
an
operation
which
he
dreaded
and
for
which
he
believed
some
eight
or
ten
weeks
of
time
were
necessary
what
is
the
matter
judson
terwilliger
asked
finally
her
husband
was
growing
so
careworn
of
aspect
nothing
my
dear
nothing
but
there
is
something
judson
and
as
your
wife
i
demand
to
know
what
it
is
perhaps
i
can
help
you
and
then
terwilliger
broke
down
and
told
the
whole
story
to
terwilliger
omitting
no
detail
stopping
only
to
bring
that
worthy
lady
to
on
the
or
more
occasions
when
her
emotions
were
too
strong
for
her
nerves
causing
her
to
swoon
when
he
had
quite
done
she
looked
him
reproachfully
in
the
eye
and
said
that
if
he
had
told
her
the
truth
instead
of
deceiving
her
on
the
night
of
the
spectral
visitation
he
might
have
been
spared
all
his
trouble
for
you
know
judson
she
said
i
have
made
a
study
of
the
art
of
acquiring
titles
since
i
read
the
story
of
the
girl
who
started
in
life
as
an
innkeeper
daughter
and
died
a
duchess
by
elizabeth
harley
hicks
of
salem
and
realized
how
one
might
be
lowly
born
and
yet
rise
to
lofty
heights
it
has
been
my
dearest
wish
that
my
girls
might
become
noblewomen
and
at
times
judson
i
have
even
hoped
that
you
might
yet
become
a
duke
great
scott
ejaculated
terwilliger
that
would
be
awful
hankinson
duke
of
terwilliger
why
molly
i
never
be
able
to
hold
up
my
head
in
shoe
circles
with
a
name
on
me
like
that
illustration
is
there
nothing
in
the
world
but
shoes
judson
asked
his
wife
seriously
you
find
shoes
are
the
foundation
upon
which
society
stands
chuckled
terwilliger
in
return
you
are
never
serious
returned
terwilliger
but
now
you
must
be
you
are
coping
with
the
supernatural
now
i
have
discovered
continued
the
lady
that
there
are
three
methods
by
which
titles
are
acquired
birth
marriage
and
purchase
you
forget
the
fourth
achievement
suggested
terwilliger
not
these
days
judson
it
used
to
be
so
but
it
is
not
so
now
now
the
spectre
has
birth
we
ca
get
any
living
duke
to
marry
her
dead
dukes
are
hard
to
find
so
there
nothing
to
do
but
to
buy
her
a
title
but
where
in
italy
you
can
get
by
the
dozen
every
grinder
in
america
grinds
away
in
the
hope
of
going
back
to
italy
and
purchasing
a
title
why
ca
you
do
the
same
me
me
grind
a
in
america
cried
hankinson
no
no
purchase
a
dukedom
i
do
want
a
dukedom
i
want
a
duchessdom
that
all
right
buy
the
title
give
it
to
the
cook
and
let
her
marry
some
spectre
of
her
own
rank
she
can
give
him
the
title
and
there
you
are
good
scheme
cried
terwilliger
but
i
say
molly
do
you
think
it
would
be
better
to
get
her
to
bring
the
spectre
over
here
and
have
me
give
him
the
title
and
then
let
him
marry
her
here
no
i
do
if
you
give
it
to
him
first
the
chances
are
he
would
go
back
on
his
bargain
he
say
that
being
a
duke
he
could
marry
a
cook
you
have
a
large
mind
molly
said
terwilliger
i
know
men
snapped
terwilliger
and
so
it
happened
hankinson
judson
terwilliger
applied
by
wire
to
the
authorities
in
rome
for
all
right
title
and
interest
in
one
dukedom
free
from
encumbrances
irrevocable
and
duly
witnessed
by
the
proper
dignitaries
of
the
italian
government
and
at
the
second
interview
with
the
spectre
cook
of
bangletop
he
was
able
to
show
her
a
cablegram
received
from
the
eternal
city
stating
that
the
papers
would
be
sent
upon
receipt
of
the
applicant
check
for
one
hundred
lire
much
his
that
asked
the
ghost
one
hundred
lire
returned
terwilliger
repeating
the
sum
to
gain
time
to
think
he
was
himself
surprised
at
the
cheapness
of
the
duchy
and
he
was
afraid
that
if
the
ghost
knew
its
real
value
she
would
decline
to
take
it
one
hundred
lire
why
that
about
dollars
pounds
they
charge
high
for
their
titles
he
added
blushing
slightly
pretty
returned
the
ghost
but
car
be
a
duke
ye
know
i
manidge
that
hankinson
explained
his
wife
scheme
to
the
spectre
that
helegant
said
she
loved
a
butler
o
the
bangletops
for
nigh
hon
to
two
years
but
or
hother
he
kep
shy
me
this
fix
but
say
terwilliger
his
one
o

dukes
as
good
as

every
bit
said
terwilliger
a

a

the
world
over
do
you
know
the
lines
of
burns

a
duke
for
a
that
never
of
replied
the
ghost
well
you
look
him
up
when
you
get
settled
down
at
home
he
was
a
smart
man
here
and
if
his
ghost
does
him
justice
you
be
mighty
glad
to
know
him
terwilliger
answered
and
thus
was
bangletop
hall
delivered
of
its
uncanny
visitor
the
ducal
appointment
entitling
its
owner
to
call
himself
duke
of
cavalcadi
was
received
in
due
time
and
handed
over
to
the
curse
of
the
kitchen
who
immediately
disappeared
and
permanently
from
the
haunts
that
had
known
her
for
so
long
and
so
disadvantageously
bangletop
hall
is
now
the
home
of
a
happy
family
to
whom
all
are
devoted
and
from
whose
no
cook
has
ever
been
known
to
depart
save
for
natural
causes
despite
all
that
has
gone
before
illustration
ariadne
has
become
countess
of
mugley
and
terwilliger
is
content
with
her
judson
whom
however
she
occasionally
calls
duke
of
cavalcadi
claiming
that
he
is
the
representative
of
that
ancient
and
noble
family
on
earth
as
for
judson
he
always
smiles
when
his
wife
calls
him
duke
but
denies
the
titular
impeachment
for
he
is
on
good
terms
with
his
landlord
whose
admiration
for
his
tenant
wholly
unexpected
ability
to
retain
his
cook
causes
him
to
regard
him
as
a
supernatural
being
and
therefore
worthy
of
a
bangletop
regard
all
of
which
terwilliger
says
to
terwilliger
might
not
be
so
my
dear
were
i
really
the
duke
for
i
honestly
believe
that
if
there
is
a
feud
of
long
standing
anywhere
in
the
universe
it
is
between
the
noble
families
of
bangletop
and
cavalcadi
over
on
the
other
shore
the
speck
on
the
lens
talking
about
inventions
said
the
oculist
as
he
very
dexterously
pocketed
two
of
the
pool
balls
the
handsome
ringer
more
familiarly
known
as
the
fifteen
ball
and
the
white
ball
itself
thereby
adding
somewhat
to
the
minus
side
of
his
string
talking
about
inventions
i
had
a
curious
experience
last
august
it
was
an
experience
which
was
not
only
interesting
from
an
inventive
point
of
view
but
it
had
likewise
a
moral
which
will
become
more
or
less
obvious
as
i
unfold
the
story
you
know
i
rented
and
occupied
a
place
in
yonkers
last
summer
it
was
situated
on
the
high
lands
to
the
north
of
the
city
a
little
this
side
of
greystone
overlooking
that
magnificent
stream
the
hudson
the
beauties
of
which
so
few
of
the
residents
along
its
banks
really
appreciate
it
was
a
comfortable
spot
with
a
few
trees
about
it
a
garden
large
enough
to
raise
a
tomato
or
two
for
a
salad
and
a
lawn
which
was
a
cure
for
sore
eyes
its
soft
sheeny
surface
affording
a
most
restful
object
upon
which
to
feast
the
tired
optic
i
believe
it
was
that
lawn
that
first
attracted
me
as
i
drove
by
the
place
with
a
patient
i
had
in
tow
it
was
just
after
a
heavy
shower
and
the
sun
breaking
through
the
clouds
and
lighting
up
the
grass
gave
to
it
a
glistening
golden
greenness
that
to
my
eyes
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
bits
of
color
i
had
seen
in
a
long
time
for
a
summer
of
that
i
said
to
myself
little
thinking
that
the
beginning
of
a
summer
thereof
to
fall
to
my
lot
before
many
days
for
on
may
i
signed
papers
which
made
me
to
all
intents
and
purposes
proprietor
of
the
place
for
the
ensuing
six
months
at
one
corner
of
the
grounds
stood
i
should
say
a
dozen
the
spreading
branches
of
which
seemed
to
form
a
roof
for
a
sort
of
enchanted
bower
in
which
you
may
be
sure
i
passed
many
of
my
leisure
hours
swinging
idly
in
a
hammock
the
cool
breezes
from
the
hudson
concerning
which
so
many
people
are
sceptical
but
which
nevertheless
exist
bringing
delight
to
the
ear
and
nostril
as
well
as
to
the
brow
which
is
so
fashionable
in
the
neighborhood
of
new
york
in
the
summer
making
the
leaves
rustle
in
a
tuneful
sort
of
fashion
and
laden
heavily
with
the
sweet
odors
of
many
a
garden
close
over
which
they
passed
before
they
got
to
me
put
that
in
rhyme
doctor
and
there
your
poem
said
the
lieutenant
as
he
made
a
combination
scratch
involving
every
ball
on
the
table
i
do
it
said
the
doctor
and
then
i
have
it
printed
as
appendix
j
to
the
third
edition
of
my
work
on
astigmatisms
and
how
to
acquire
but
to
get
back
to
my
story
he
continued
i
was
lying
there
in
my
hammock
one
afternoon
trying
to
take
a
census
of
the
butterflies
in
sight
when
i
thought
i
heard
some
one
back
of
me
call
me
by
name
instantly
the
butterfly
census
was
forgotten
and
i
was
on
the
alert
but
whether
there
was
something
the
matter
with
my
eyes
or
not
i
do
not
know
despite
all
my
alertness
there
was
a
soul
in
sight
that
i
could
see
of
course
i
was
slightly
mystified
at
first
and
then
i
attributed
the
interruption
either
to
imagination
or
to
some
whose
voice
wafted
on
the
breeze
might
have
reached
my
ears
i
threw
myself
back
into
the
hammock
once
more
and
was
just
about
dozing
off
to
the
lullaby
sung
by
a
bee
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
rustling
leaves
when
i
again
heard
my
name
distinctly
spoken
this
time
there
was
no
mistake
about
it
for
as
i
sprang
to
my
feet
and
looked
about
i
saw
coming
towards
me
a
man
of
unpleasantly
cadaverous
aspect
whose
years
i
should
judge
were
at
least
eighty
in
number
his
beard
was
so
long
and
scant
that
to
keep
the
breezes
from
blowing
it
about
to
his
discomfort
he
had
tucked
the
ends
of
it
into
his
vest
pocket
his
eyes
black
as
coals
were
piercing
as
gimlets
their
sharpness
equalled
by
nothing
that
i
had
ever
seen
excepting
perhaps
the
point
of
this
same
person
nose
which
was
long
and
thin
suggesting
a
razor
with
a
bowie
point
his
slight
body
was
clad
in
sombre
garb
and
at
first
glance
he
appeared
to
me
so
disquietingly
like
a
visitor
from
the
supernatural
world
that
i
shuddered
but
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
all
gentleness
and
whatever
of
fear
i
had
experienced
was
in
a
moment
dissipated
are
doctor
carey
he
said
in
a
timid
sort
of
fashion
i
replied
am
what
can
i
do
for
you
distinguished
oculist
he
added
as
if
not
hearing
my
question
i
a
sort
of
notorious
i
answered
my
modesty
preventing
my
entire
acquiescence
in
his
manner
of
putting
it
he
smiled
pleasantly
as
i
said
this
and
then
drew
out
of
his
pocket
a
small
tin
box
which
until
he
opened
it
i
supposed
contained
a
one
of
those
folding
tin
cups
carey
said
he
sitting
down
in
the
hammock
which
i
had
vacated
and
toying
with
the
tin
box
a
proceeding
that
was
so
extraordinarily
cool
that
it
made
me
shiver
have
been
looking
for
you
for
just
mortal
years
me
i
returned
as
nonchalantly
as
i
could
considering
the
fact
that
i
was
beginning
to
be
annoyed
me
but
that
statement
seems
to
indicate
that
i
was
born
famous
which
i
inclined
to
doubt
inasmuch
as
i
am
not
yet
fifty
years
old
i
can
not
understand
how
it
has
come
to
pass
that
you
have
been
looking
for
me
for
years
my
statement
was
correct
said
he
have
been
looking
for
you
for
years
but
not
for
you
as
you
this
made
me
laugh
although
it
added
slightly
to
my
nervousness
which
was
now
beginning
to
return
to
have
a
man
with
a
tin
box
in
his
hand
tell
me
he
had
been
looking
for
me
for
thirteen
years
longer
than
i
had
lived
and
then
to
have
him
add
that
it
was
not
however
me
as
myself
that
he
wanted
was
amusing
in
a
sense
and
yet
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
it
would
be
a
relief
to
know
that
the
tin
box
did
hold
a
and
not
dynamite
seem
to
speak
english
i
said
in
answer
to
this
remark
i
have
always
thought
i
understood
that
language
pretty
well
but
excuse
me
if
i
say
that
i
do
see
your
point
is
it
that
great
men
are
so
frequently
obtuse
he
said
languidly
giving
the
ground
such
a
push
with
his
toe
that
it
set
the
hammock
swinging
furiously
i
say
that
i
have
searched
for
you
all
these
years
but
not
for
you
as
you
i
mean
not
for
you
as
carey
not
for
you
as
an
individual
but
for
you
as
the
possessor
of
a
very
rare
eye
on
i
said
feebly
and
rubbed
my
forehead
thinking
perhaps
my
brains
had
got
into
a
tangle
and
were
responsible
for
this
extraordinary
affair
is
the
peculiar
quality
which
makes
my
eye
so
rare
is
only
one
pair
of
eyes
like
them
in
the
world
that
i
know
of
said
the
stranger
i
have
visited
all
lands
in
search
of
them
and
experimented
with
all
kinds
of
eyes
i
am
the
proud
possessor
of
that
pair
i
queried
becoming
slightly
more
interested
you
said
he
and
i
together
possess
that
pair
however
and
i
i
cried
said
he
left
eye
and
my
right
have
the
honor
of
being
the
only
two
unique
eyes
in
the
world
queer
too
i
observed
a
mixture
of
sarcasm
and
flippancy
in
my
tones
i
fear
mean
twonique
do
you
the
old
gentleman
drew
himself
up
with
dignity
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
and
remarked
that
if
i
intended
to
be
flippant
he
would
leave
me
of
course
i
would
not
hear
of
this
now
that
my
curiosity
had
been
aroused
and
so
i
apologized
mention
it
he
said
my
dear
doctor
you
can
not
imagine
my
sensations
when
i
found
your
eye
yesterday
you
found
it
yesterday
did
you
i
put
in
he
said
street
was
on
street
yesterday
i
replied
really
i
was
not
conscious
of
the
loss
of
my
eye
said
you
had
lost
it
said
my
visitor
only
said
i
had
found
it
i
mean
by
that
that
i
found
it
as
columbus
found
america
america
was
not
necessarily
lost
before
it
was
found
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
passing
through
the
street
as
you
left
your
club
i
glanced
into
your
face
as
i
passed
caught
sight
of
your
eye
and
my
heart
stood
still
there
at
last
was
that
for
which
i
had
so
long
and
so
earnestly
searched
and
so
overcome
was
i
with
joy
at
my
discovery
that
i
seemed
to
lose
all
power
of
speech
of
locomotion
or
of
sane
thought
and
not
until
you
had
passed
entirely
out
of
sight
did
i
return
really
to
my
senses
then
i
rushed
madly
into
the
i
had
seen
you
leave
a
few
moments
before
described
you
to
the
man
at
the
door
learned
your
name
and
address
and
well
here
i
am
what
does
all
this
extraordinary
nonsense
lead
up
to
i
asked
do
you
intend
to
do
about
my
eye
do
you
wish
to
borrow
it
buy
it
or
steal
it
carey
said
my
visitor
sadly
shall
not
live
very
long
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
another
summer
will
find
me
in
my
grave
and
i
do
not
want
to
die
without
imparting
to
the
world
the
news
of
a
marvellous
discovery
i
have
made
the
details
of
a
wonderful
invention
that
i
have
not
only
conceived
but
have
actually
put
into
working
order
an
unknown
man
too
old
to
be
able
to
refute
the
charge
of
senility
were
any
one
disposed
to
question
the
value
of
my
statements
could
announce
to
the
world
my
great
discovery
a
thousand
times
a
day
and
very
properly
the
world
would
decline
to
believe
in
me
the
world
would
cry
humbug
and
i
should
have
been
unable
had
i
failed
to
find
you
to
convince
the
world
that
i
was
not
a
humbug
with
the
discovery
of
your
eye
all
that
is
changed
i
shall
have
an
ally
in
you
and
that
is
valuable
for
the
reason
that
your
statements
whatever
they
may
be
will
always
be
entitled
to
and
will
receive
respectful
attention
here
in
this
box
is
my
invention
i
shall
let
you
discover
its
marvellous
power
for
yourself
hoping
that
when
you
have
discovered
its
power
you
will
tell
the
world
of
it
and
of
its
inventor
with
that
said
the
doctor
the
old
fellow
handed
me
the
tin
box
which
i
opened
with
considerable
misgivings
as
to
possible
results
there
was
no
explosion
however
the
cover
came
off
easily
enough
and
on
the
inside
was
a
curiously
shaped
telescope
not
a
as
i
had
at
first
surmised
it
a
telescope
is
it
i
said
what
did
you
suppose
it
was
he
asked
had
an
idea
i
replied
not
exactly
truthfully
it
ca
be
good
for
much
in
this
shape
i
added
for
as
i
pulled
the
parts
out
and
got
it
to
its
full
length
i
found
that
each
section
was
curved
and
that
the
whole
formed
an
arc
which
though
scarcely
perceptible
nevertheless
should
it
seemed
to
me
have
interfered
with
the
utility
of
the
instrument
the
point
i
want
you
to
establish
one
way
or
the
other
said
my
visitor
getting
up
out
of
the
hammock
and
pacing
nervously
up
and
down
the
lawn
my
eye
that
telescope
is
a
marvel
and
is
the
result
of
years
of
experiment
it
fulfils
my
expectations
and
if
your
eye
is
what
i
think
it
is
i
shall
at
last
have
found
another
to
whom
it
will
appear
the
treasure
it
appears
to
me
to
be
you
have
a
tower
on
your
house
i
see
let
us
go
up
on
the
roof
of
the
tower
and
test
the
glass
then
we
shall
see
if
i
claim
too
much
for
it
the
earnestness
of
the
old
gentleman
interested
me
hugely
and
i
led
the
way
through
the
garden
to
the
house
up
the
tower
stairs
to
the
roof
and
then
standing
there
looking
across
the
river
at
the
palisades
looming
up
like
a
huge
fortress
before
me
i
put
the
telescope
to
my
eye
see
absolutely
nothing
i
said
after
vainly
trying
to
fathom
the
depths
of
the
instrument
began
the
old
gentleman
and
then
he
laughed
nervously
are
using
the
wrong
eye
try
the
other
one
it
is
your
left
eye
that
has
the
power
to
show
the
virtues
of
this
glass
i
obeyed
his
order
and
then
a
most
singular
thing
happened
strange
sights
met
my
gaze
at
first
i
could
see
nothing
but
the
palisades
opposite
me
but
in
an
instant
my
horizon
seemed
to
broaden
the
vista
through
the
telescope
deepened
and
before
i
knew
it
my
sight
was
speeding
now
through
a
beautiful
country
over
fields
hills
and
valleys
then
on
through
great
cities
out
to
and
over
a
broad
gently
undulating
stretch
which
i
at
once
recognized
as
the
prairie
lands
of
the
west
in
a
minute
more
i
began
to
catch
the
idea
of
this
wonderful
glass
for
i
now
saw
rising
up
before
me
the
wonderful
beauties
of
the
yosemite
and
then
like
a
flash
of
the
lightning
my
vision
passed
over
the
sierra
nevada
range
my
eye
swept
down
upon
san
francisco
and
was
soon
speeding
over
the
waters
of
the
pacific
two
minutes
later
i
saw
the
strange
pagodas
of
the
chinese
rising
before
me
sweeping
my
glass
to
the
north
bleak
siberia
met
my
gaze
then
to
the
south
i
saw
india
her
jungles
her
waste
places
not
long
after
a
most
awful
sight
met
my
gaze
i
saw
a
huge
ship
at
the
moment
of
foundering
in
the
indian
ocean
horrified
i
turned
my
glass
again
to
the
north
and
the
minarets
of
stamboul
rose
up
before
me
then
the
dome
of
peter
at
rome
then
paris
then
london
then
the
atlantic
ocean
i
levelled
my
glass
due
west
and
finally
i
could
see
nothing
but
one
small
black
speck
as
like
to
a
fleck
of
dust
as
to
anything
else
on
the
lens
at
the
other
end
with
a
movement
of
my
hand
i
tried
to
wipe
it
off
but
it
still
remained
and
in
answer
to
a
chuckle
at
my
side
i
put
the
glass
down
is
the
most
extraordinary
thing
i
ever
saw
i
said
it
is
said
the
other
can
almost
see
around
the
world
with
it
i
cried
breathless
nearly
with
enthusiasm
can
quite
said
the
inventor
calmly
i
said
claim
too
much
my
friend
is
true
said
he
you
notice
a
speck
on
the
glass
i
am
sure
you
did
for
you
tried
to
remove
it
said
i
did
but
what
of
it
what
does
that
signify
proves
what
i
said
he
answered
did
see
all
the
way
around
the
world
with
that
glass
the
black
spot
on
the
lens
that
you
thought
was
a
piece
of
dust
was
the
back
of
your
own
head
my
boy
the
back
of
my
head
is
bigger
than
that
i
said
it
is
he
responded
you
must
make
some
allowance
for
perspective
the
back
of
your
head
is
a
trifle
less
than
thousand
miles
from
the
end
of
your
nose
the
way
you
were
looking
at
it
you
mean
to
say
began
the
lieutenant
as
the
doctor
paused
to
chalk
his
cue
never
mind
what
i
mean
to
say
said
the
doctor
reflect
upon
what
i
have
said
but
the
man
and
the
telescope
what
became
of
them
asked
the
lieutenant
i
was
about
to
tell
you
that
the
old
fellow
who
had
made
this
marvellous
glass
which
to
two
eyes
that
he
knew
of
and
to
only
two
would
work
as
was
desired
feeling
that
he
was
about
to
die
had
come
to
me
to
offer
the
glass
for
sale
on
two
considerations
one
was
a
consideration
of
the
other
was
that
i
would
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
discover
a
possible
third
person
younger
than
myself
with
an
eye
similar
to
those
we
had
to
whom
at
my
death
the
glass
should
be
transmitted
exacting
from
him
the
promise
that
he
too
would
see
that
it
was
passed
along
in
the
same
manner
into
the
hands
of
posterity
i
was
also
to
acquaint
the
world
with
the
story
of
the
glass
and
the
name
of
its
inventor
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
and
you
of
course
accepted
i
did
said
the
doctor
but
having
no
money
in
my
pocket
i
went
down
into
the
house
to
borrow
it
of
my
wife
and
upon
my
return
to
the
roof
found
no
trace
of
the
glass
the
old
man
or
the
roof
either
what
cried
the
lieutenant
are
you
crazy
no
smiled
the
doctor
not
at
all
for
the
moment
i
reached
the
roof
of
the
house
i
opened
my
eyes
and
found
myself
still
swinging
in
the
hammock
under
the
trees
and
the
moral
queried
the
lieutenant
you
promised
a
moral
or
i
should
not
have
listened
always
have
money
in
your
pocket
replied
the
doctor
pocketing
the
last
ball
and
putting
up
his
cue
then
you
are
not
apt
to
lose
great
bargains
such
as
i
lost
for
the
want
of
it
a
good
idea
returned
the
lieutenant
and
you
live
up
to
it
i
suppose
i
do
returned
the
oculist
tapping
his
pocket
significantly
always
then
said
the
lieutenant
earnestly
i
wish
you
lend
me
a
tenner
for
really
doctor
i
have
gone
clean
broke
a
midnight
visitor
i
do
not
assert
that
what
i
am
about
to
relate
is
in
all
its
particulars
absolutely
true
not
understand
me
that
it
is
not
true
but
i
do
not
feel
that
i
care
to
make
an
assertion
that
is
more
than
likely
to
be
received
by
a
sceptical
age
with
sneers
of
incredulity
i
will
content
myself
with
a
simple
narration
of
the
events
of
that
evening
the
memory
of
which
is
so
indelibly
impressed
upon
my
mind
and
which
were
i
able
to
do
so
i
should
forget
without
any
sentiments
of
regret
whatsoever
the
affair
happened
on
the
night
before
i
fell
ill
of
typhoid
fever
and
is
about
the
sole
remaining
remembrance
of
that
immediate
period
left
to
me
briefly
the
story
is
as
follows
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
i
was
overworked
in
the
practice
of
my
profession
it
was
early
in
march
and
i
was
preparing
my
contributions
for
the
coming
christmas
issues
of
the
periodicals
for
which
i
write
i
had
accepted
the
highly
honorable
position
of
entertainment
committeeman
at
one
of
the
small
clubs
to
which
i
belonged
i
accepted
the
office
supposing
that
the
duties
connected
with
it
were
easy
of
performance
and
with
absolutely
no
notion
that
the
faith
of
my
in
my
judgment
was
so
strong
that
they
would
ultimately
manifest
a
desire
to
leave
the
whole
programme
for
the
club
diversion
in
my
hands
this
however
they
did
and
when
the
month
of
march
assumed
command
of
the
calendar
i
found
myself
utterly
fagged
out
and
at
my
wits
end
to
know
what
style
of
entertainment
to
provide
for
the
club
meeting
to
be
held
on
the
evening
of
the
of
that
month
i
had
provided
already
an
unusually
taking
variety
of
evenings
of
which
one
in
particular
called
the
martyrs
night
in
which
living
authors
writhed
through
selections
from
their
own
works
while
an
inhuman
audience
every
man
of
whom
had
suffered
even
as
the
victims
then
suffered
sat
on
tenscore
of
puffing
the
smoke
of
score
of
free
cigars
into
their
faces
and
gloating
over
their
misery
was
extremely
successful
and
had
gained
for
me
among
my
professional
brethren
the
enviable
title
of
machiavelli
junior
this
performance
in
fact
was
the
one
now
uppermost
in
the
minds
of
the
club
members
having
been
the
most
recent
of
the
series
and
it
had
been
prophesied
by
many
men
whose
judgment
was
unassailable
that
no
man
not
even
i
could
ever
conceive
of
anything
that
could
surpass
it
disposed
at
first
to
question
the
accuracy
of
a
prophecy
to
the
effect
that
i
was
like
most
others
of
my
kind
possessed
of
limitations
i
came
finally
to
believe
that
perhaps
after
all
these
male
cassandras
with
whom
i
was
thrown
were
right
indeed
the
more
i
racked
my
brains
to
think
of
something
better
than
the
martyrs
night
the
more
i
became
convinced
that
in
that
achievement
i
had
reached
the
zenith
of
my
powers
the
thing
for
me
to
do
now
was
to
hook
myself
securely
on
to
the
zenith
and
stay
there
but
how
to
do
it
that
was
the
question
which
drove
sleep
from
my
eyes
and
deprived
me
for
a
period
of
six
weeks
of
my
reason
my
hair
departing
immediately
upon
the
restoration
thereof
a
not
uncommon
of
typhoid
illustration
it
was
a
typical
march
night
this
one
upon
which
the
extraordinary
incident
about
to
be
related
took
place
it
was
the
kind
of
night
that
novelists
use
when
they
are
handling
a
mystery
that
in
the
abstract
would
amount
to
nothing
but
which
in
the
concrete
of
a
bit
of
wild
weird
and
windy
nocturnalism
sends
the
reader
into
hysterics
it
may
be
i
shall
not
attempt
to
deny
it
that
had
it
happened
upon
another
kind
of
an
evening
a
soft
mild
balmy
june
evening
for
instance
my
own
experience
would
have
seemed
less
worthy
of
preservation
in
the
amber
of
publicity
but
of
that
the
reader
must
judge
for
himself
the
fact
alone
remains
that
upon
the
night
when
my
uncanny
visitor
appeared
the
weather
department
was
apparently
engaged
in
getting
rid
of
its
remnants
there
was
a
large
percentage
of
withering
blast
in
the
general
of
the
evening
there
were
rain
and
snow
which
alternated
in
pattering
upon
my
and
whitening
the
apology
for
a
wold
that
stands
three
blocks
from
my
flat
on
madison
square
the
wind
whistled
as
it
always
does
upon
occasions
of
this
sort
and
from
all
corners
of
my
apartment
after
the
usual
fashion
there
seemed
to
come
sounds
of
a
supernatural
order
the
effect
of
which
was
to
send
cold
chills
off
on
their
regular
trips
up
and
down
the
spine
of
their
victim
in
this
instance
myself
i
wish
that
at
the
time
the
hackneyed
quality
of
these
sensations
had
appealed
to
me
that
it
did
not
do
so
was
shown
by
the
highly
nervous
state
in
which
i
found
myself
as
my
clock
struck
eleven
if
i
could
only
have
realized
at
that
hour
that
these
symptoms
were
the
same
old
threadbare
premonitions
of
the
appearance
of
a
supernatural
being
i
should
have
left
the
house
and
gone
to
the
club
and
so
have
avoided
the
visitation
then
imminent
had
i
done
this
i
should
doubtless
also
have
escaped
the
typhoid
since
the
doctors
attributed
that
misfortune
to
the
shock
of
my
experience
which
in
my
then
wearied
state
i
was
unable
to
sustain
and
what
the
escape
of
typhoid
would
have
meant
to
me
only
those
who
have
seen
the
bills
of
my
physician
and
druggist
for
services
rendered
and
prescriptions
compounded
are
aware
that
my
mind
unconsciously
took
thought
of
spirits
was
shown
by
the
fact
that
when
the
first
chill
came
upon
me
i
arose
and
poured
out
for
myself
a
stiff
bumper
of
old
reserve
rye
which
i
immediately
swallowed
but
beyond
this
i
did
not
go
i
simply
sat
there
before
my
fire
and
cudgelled
my
brains
for
an
idea
whereby
my
at
the
gutenberg
club
might
be
amused
how
long
i
sat
there
i
do
not
know
it
may
have
been
ten
minutes
it
may
have
been
an
hour
i
was
barely
conscious
of
the
passing
of
time
but
i
do
know
that
the
clock
in
the
dutch
reformed
church
steeple
at
street
and
fifth
avenue
was
clanging
out
the
first
stroke
of
the
hour
of
midnight
when
my
rang
theretofore
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
word
the
tintinnabulation
of
my
had
been
invariably
pleasing
unto
me
i
am
fond
of
company
and
company
alone
was
betokened
by
its
ringing
since
my
creditors
gratify
their
passion
for
interviews
at
my
office
if
perchance
they
happen
to
find
me
there
but
on
this
occasion
i
could
not
at
the
moment
tell
why
its
clanging
seemed
the
very
essence
of
discord
it
jangled
with
my
nervous
system
and
as
it
ceased
i
was
conscious
of
a
feeling
of
irritability
which
is
utterly
at
variance
with
my
nature
outside
of
business
hours
in
the
office
for
the
sake
of
discipline
i
frequently
adopt
a
querulous
manner
finding
it
necessary
in
dealing
with
but
the
moment
i
leave
shop
behind
me
i
become
a
different
individual
entirely
and
have
been
called
a
moteless
sunbeam
by
those
who
have
seen
only
that
side
of
my
character
this
must
be
regarded
as
a
confidential
communication
since
i
am
at
present
engaged
in
preparing
a
edition
of
the
philosophical
works
of
schopenhauer
in
words
of
one
syllable
and
were
it
known
that
the
publisher
had
intrusted
the
magnificent
pessimism
of
that
illustrious
juggler
of
words
and
theories
to
a
moteless
sunbeam
it
might
seriously
interfere
with
the
sale
of
the
work
and
i
may
say
too
that
this
request
that
my
confidence
be
respected
is
entirely
disinterested
inasmuch
as
i
declined
to
do
the
work
on
the
royalty
plan
insisting
upon
the
payment
of
a
lump
sum
considerably
in
advance
but
to
return
i
heard
the
bell
ring
with
a
sense
of
profound
disgust
i
did
not
wish
to
see
anybody
my
whiskey
was
low
my
quinine
pills
few
in
number
my
chills
alone
were
present
in
a
profusion
bordering
upon
ostentation
i
pretend
not
to
hear
it
i
said
to
myself
resuming
my
work
of
gazing
at
the
flickering
light
of
my
fire
which
was
the
only
light
in
the
room
went
the
bell
as
if
in
answer
to
my
resolve
confound
the
luck
i
cried
jumping
from
my
chair
and
going
to
the
door
with
the
intention
of
opening
it
an
intention
however
which
was
speedily
abandoned
for
as
i
approached
it
a
sickly
fear
came
over
me
a
sensation
i
had
never
before
known
seemed
to
take
hold
of
my
being
and
instead
of
opening
the
door
i
pushed
the
bolt
to
make
it
the
more
secure
illustration
there
a
hint
for
you
whoever
you
are
i
cried
do
you
hear
that
bolt
slide
you
i
added
tremulously
for
from
the
other
side
there
came
no
reply
only
a
more
violent
ringing
of
the
bell
see
here
i
called
out
as
loudly
as
i
could
who
are
you
anyhow
what
do
you
want
there
was
no
answer
except
from
the
bell
which
began
again
too
cheap
to
steal
i
called
again
if
you
want
wire
go
buy
it
do
try
to
pull
mine
out
it
is
mine
anyhow
it
belongs
to
the
house
still
there
was
no
reply
only
the
clanging
of
the
bell
and
then
my
curiosity
overcame
my
fear
and
with
a
quick
movement
i
threw
open
the
door
are
you
satisfied
now
i
said
angrily
but
i
addressed
an
empty
vestibule
there
was
absolutely
no
one
there
and
then
i
sat
down
on
the
mat
and
laughed
i
never
was
so
glad
to
see
no
one
in
my
life
but
my
laugh
was
what
made
that
bell
ring
i
suddenly
asked
myself
and
then
the
feeling
of
fear
came
upon
me
again
i
gathered
my
somewhat
shattered
self
together
sprang
to
my
feet
slammed
the
door
with
such
force
that
the
corridors
echoed
to
the
sound
slid
the
bolt
once
more
turned
the
key
moved
a
heavy
chair
in
front
of
it
and
then
fled
like
a
frightened
hare
to
the
sideboard
in
my
there
i
grasped
the
decanter
holding
my
whiskey
seized
a
glass
from
the
shelf
and
started
to
pour
out
the
usual
dram
when
the
glass
fell
from
my
hand
and
was
shivered
into
a
thousand
pieces
on
the
hardwood
floor
for
as
i
poured
i
glanced
through
the
open
door
and
there
in
my
sanctum
the
flicker
of
a
random
flame
divulged
the
form
of
a
being
the
eyes
of
whom
seemed
fixed
on
mine
piercing
me
through
and
through
to
say
that
i
was
petrified
but
dimly
expresses
the
situation
i
was
granitized
and
so
i
remained
until
by
a
more
luminous
flicker
from
the
burning
wood
i
perceived
that
the
being
wore
a
flaring
red
necktie
he
is
human
i
thought
and
with
the
thought
the
tension
on
my
nervous
system
relaxed
and
i
was
able
to
feel
a
sufficiently
sense
of
indignation
to
demand
an
explanation
this
is
a
mighty
cool
proceeding
on
your
part
i
said
leaving
the
sideboard
and
walking
into
the
sanctum
illustration
yes
he
replied
in
a
tone
that
made
me
jump
it
was
so
extremely
sepulchral
a
tone
that
seemed
as
if
it
might
have
been
acquired
in
a
damp
corner
of
some
cave
off
the
earth
but
it
a
cool
evening
i
wonder
that
a
man
of
your
coolness
does
hire
himself
out
to
some
refrigerating
company
i
remarked
with
a
sneer
which
would
have
delighted
the
soul
of
cassius
himself
i
have
thought
of
it
returned
the
being
calmly
but
never
went
any
further
proprietors
have
always
outbid
the
refrigerating
people
and
they
in
turn
have
been
laid
low
by
millionaires
who
have
hired
me
on
occasion
to
freeze
out
people
they
did
like
but
who
have
persisted
in
calling
i
must
confess
though
my
dear
hiram
that
you
are
not
much
warmer
yourself
this
greeting
is
hardly
what
i
expected
well
if
you
want
to
make
me
warmer
i
retorted
hotly
just
keep
on
calling
me
hiram
how
the
deuce
did
you
know
of
that
blot
on
my
escutcheon
anyhow
i
added
for
hiram
was
one
of
the
crimes
of
my
family
that
i
had
tried
to
conceal
my
parents
having
fastened
the
name
of
hiram
spencer
carrington
upon
me
at
baptism
for
no
reason
other
than
that
my
rich
bachelor
uncle
who
subsequently
failed
and
became
a
charge
upon
me
was
so
named
i
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
church
when
you
were
baptized
returned
the
visitor
and
as
you
were
an
interesting
baby
i
have
kept
an
eye
on
you
ever
since
of
course
i
knew
that
you
discarded
hiram
as
soon
as
you
got
old
enough
to
put
away
childish
things
and
since
the
failure
of
your
uncle
i
have
been
aware
that
you
desired
to
be
known
as
spencer
carrington
but
to
me
you
are
always
have
been
and
always
will
be
hiram
well
do
give
it
away
i
pleaded
i
hope
to
be
famous
some
day
and
if
the
american
newspaper
paragrapher
ever
got
hold
of
the
fact
that
once
in
my
life
i
was
hiram
i
have
to
hiram
to
let
me
alone
that
a
bad
joke
hiram
said
the
visitor
and
for
that
reason
i
like
it
though
i
do
laugh
there
is
no
danger
of
your
becoming
famous
if
you
stick
to
humor
of
that
sort
well
i
like
to
know
i
put
in
my
anger
returning
i
like
to
know
who
in
brindisi
you
are
what
in
cairo
you
want
and
what
in
the
name
of
the
seventeen
hinges
of
the
gates
of
singapore
you
are
doing
here
at
this
time
of
night
when
you
were
a
baby
hiram
you
had
blue
eyes
said
my
visitor
bonny
blue
eyes
as
the
poet
says
what
of
it
i
asked
this
replied
my
visitor
if
you
have
them
now
you
can
very
easily
see
what
i
am
doing
here
am
sitting
down
and
talking
to
oh
are
you
i
said
with
fine
scorn
i
had
not
observed
that
the
fact
is
my
eyes
were
so
weakened
by
the
brilliance
of
that
necktie
of
yours
that
i
doubt
i
could
see
anything
not
even
one
of
my
own
jokes
it
a
scorcher
that
tie
of
yours
in
fact
i
never
saw
anything
so
red
in
my
life
i
do
not
see
why
you
complain
of
my
tie
said
the
visitor
your
own
is
just
as
bad
blue
is
never
so
withering
as
red
i
retorted
at
the
same
time
caressing
the
scarf
i
wore
perhaps
not
but
ah
if
you
will
look
in
the
glass
hiram
you
will
observe
that
your
point
is
not
well
taken
said
my
calmly
i
acted
upon
the
suggestion
and
looked
upon
my
reflection
in
the
glass
lighting
a
match
to
facilitate
the
operation
i
was
horrified
to
observe
that
my
beautiful
blue
tie
of
which
i
was
so
proud
had
in
some
manner
changed
and
was
now
of
the
same
aggressive
hue
as
was
that
of
my
visitor
red
even
as
a
brick
is
red
to
grasp
it
firmly
in
my
hands
and
tear
it
from
my
neck
was
the
work
of
a
moment
and
then
in
a
spirit
of
rage
i
turned
upon
my
companion
see
here
i
cried
i
had
quite
enough
of
you
i
ca
make
you
out
and
i
ca
say
that
i
want
to
you
know
where
the
door
is
you
will
oblige
me
by
putting
it
to
its
proper
use
illustration
sit
down
hiram
said
he
and
do
be
foolish
and
ungrateful
you
are
behaving
in
a
most
extraordinary
fashion
destroying
your
clothing
and
acting
like
a
madman
generally
what
was
the
use
of
ripping
up
a
handsome
tie
like
that
i
despise
loud
hues
red
is
a
jockey
color
i
answered
but
you
did
not
destroy
the
red
tie
said
he
with
a
smile
you
tore
up
your
blue
one
look
there
it
is
on
the
floor
the
red
one
you
still
have
on
investigation
showed
the
truth
of
my
visitor
assertion
that
flaunting
streamer
of
anarchy
still
made
my
neck
infamous
and
before
me
on
the
floor
an
almost
unrecognizable
mass
of
shreds
lay
my
cherished
cerulean
tie
the
revelation
stunned
me
tears
came
into
my
eyes
and
trickling
down
over
my
cheeks
fairly
hissed
with
the
feverish
heat
of
my
flesh
my
muscles
relaxed
and
i
fell
limp
into
my
chair
you
need
stimulant
said
my
visitor
kindly
go
take
a
drop
of
your
old
reserve
and
then
come
back
here
to
me
i
something
to
say
to
you
will
you
join
me
i
asked
faintly
no
returned
the
visitor
i
am
so
fond
of
whiskey
that
i
never
molest
it
that
act
which
is
your
stimulant
is
death
to
the
rye
never
realized
that
did
you
no
i
never
did
i
said
meekly
and
yet
you
claim
to
love
it
bah
he
said
and
then
i
obeyed
his
command
drained
my
glass
to
the
dregs
and
returned
what
is
your
mission
i
asked
when
i
had
made
myself
as
comfortable
as
was
possible
under
the
circumstances
to
relieve
you
of
your
woes
he
said
you
are
a
homoeopath
i
observe
said
i
with
a
sneer
you
are
a
homoeopath
in
theory
and
an
allopath
in
practice
i
am
not
usually
unintelligent
said
he
i
fail
to
comprehend
your
meaning
perhaps
you
express
yourself
badly
i
wish
you
express
yourself
for
i
retorted
hotly
what
i
mean
is
you
believe
in
the
business
but
you
prescribe
large
doses
i
do
believe
troubles
like
mine
can
be
cured
on
your
plan
a
man
ca
get
rid
of
his
stock
by
adding
to
it
illustration
ah
i
see
you
think
i
have
added
to
your
troubles
i
do
think
so
i
answered
with
a
fond
glance
at
my
ruined
tie
i
know
so
well
wait
until
i
have
laid
my
plan
before
you
and
see
if
you
change
your
mind
said
my
visitor
significantly
all
right
i
said
proceed
only
hurry
i
go
to
bed
early
as
a
rule
and
it
getting
quite
early
now
it
only
one
said
the
visitor
ignoring
the
sarcasm
but
i
will
hasten
as
i
several
other
calls
to
make
before
breakfast
are
you
a
milkman
i
asked
you
are
flippant
he
replied
but
hiram
he
added
i
have
come
here
to
aid
you
in
spite
of
your
unworthiness
you
want
to
know
what
to
provide
for
your
club
night
on
the
you
want
something
that
will
knock
the
night
silly
not
exactly
that
i
replied
i
do
want
anything
so
abominably
good
as
to
make
all
the
other
things
i
have
done
seem
failures
that
is
not
good
business
would
you
like
to
be
hailed
as
the
discoverer
of
genius
would
you
like
to
be
the
responsible
agent
for
the
greatest
exhibition
of
skill
in
a
certain
direction
ever
seen
would
you
like
to
become
the
most
famous
the
world
has
ever
known
now
i
said
forgetting
my
dignity
under
the
enthusiasm
with
which
i
was
inspired
by
my
visitor
words
and
infected
more
or
less
with
his
undoubtedly
magnetite
spirit
now
you
shouting
i
thought
so
hiram
i
thought
so
and
that
why
i
am
here
i
saw
you
on
wall
street
and
read
your
difficulty
at
once
in
your
eyes
and
i
resolved
to
help
you
i
am
a
magician
and
one
or
two
little
things
have
happened
of
late
to
make
me
wish
to
prestidigitate
in
public
i
knew
you
were
after
a
show
of
some
kind
and
i
come
to
offer
you
my
services
oh
pshaw
i
said
the
members
of
the
gutenberg
club
are
men
of
brains
not
children
card
tricks
are
hackneyed
and
shows
pall
illustration
do
they
indeed
said
the
visitor
well
mine
wo
if
you
believe
it
i
prove
to
you
what
i
can
do
i
have
no
paraphernalia
i
said
well
i
have
said
he
and
as
he
spoke
a
pack
of
cards
seemed
to
grow
out
of
my
hands
i
must
have
turned
pale
at
this
unexpected
happening
for
my
visitor
smiled
and
said
do
be
frightened
that
only
one
of
my
tricks
now
choose
a
card
he
added
and
when
you
have
done
so
toss
the
pack
in
the
air
do
tell
me
what
the
card
is
it
alone
will
fall
to
the
floor
nonsense
said
i
it
impossible
do
as
i
tell
you
i
did
as
he
told
me
to
a
degree
only
i
tossed
the
cards
in
the
air
without
choosing
one
although
i
made
a
feint
of
doing
so
a
card
fell
back
to
the
floor
they
every
one
disappeared
from
view
in
the
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
heavy
chair
i
had
rolled
in
front
of
the
door
i
think
i
should
have
fled
how
that
for
a
trick
asked
my
visitor
i
said
nothing
for
the
very
good
reason
that
my
words
stuck
in
my
throat
give
me
a
little
de
will
you
please
said
he
after
a
moment
pause
i
have
a
drop
in
the
house
i
said
relieved
to
think
that
this
wonderful
being
could
come
down
to
anything
so
earthly
pshaw
hiram
he
ejaculated
apparently
in
disgust
do
be
mean
and
above
all
do
lie
why
man
you
got
a
bottle
full
of
it
in
your
hand
do
you
want
it
all
he
was
right
where
it
came
from
i
do
not
know
but
beyond
question
the
graceful
bottle
was
in
my
right
hand
and
my
left
held
a
of
exquisite
form
say
i
gasped
as
soon
as
i
was
able
to
collect
my
thoughts
what
are
your
terms
wait
a
moment
he
answered
let
me
do
a
little
before
we
arrange
preliminaries
i
have
much
of
a
mind
to
read
tonight
i
answered
wildly
illustration
you
right
there
said
he
it
like
a
dime
novel
that
mind
of
yours
but
i
do
the
best
i
can
with
it
suppose
you
think
of
your
favorite
poem
and
after
turning
it
over
in
your
mind
carefully
for
a
few
minutes
select
two
lines
from
it
concealing
them
of
course
from
me
and
i
will
tell
you
what
they
are
now
my
favorite
poem
i
regret
to
say
is
lewis
carroll
jabberwock
a
fact
i
was
ashamed
to
confess
to
an
utter
stranger
so
i
tried
to
deceive
him
by
thinking
of
some
other
lines
the
effort
was
hardly
successful
for
the
only
other
lines
i
could
call
to
mind
at
the
moment
were
from
rudyard
kipling
rhyme
the
post
that
fitted
and
which
ran
year
by
year
in
pious
patience
vengeful
boffin
sits
waiting
for
the
sleary
babies
to
develop
sleary
fits
humph
ejaculated
my
visitor
you
a
great
hiram
you
are
and
then
rising
from
his
chair
and
walking
to
my
poet
corner
the
magician
selected
two
volumes
there
said
he
handing
me
the
you
find
the
lines
you
tried
to
fool
me
with
at
the
foot
of
page
thirteen
look
i
looked
and
there
lay
that
vile
sleary
sentiment
in
all
the
majesty
of
type
staring
me
in
the
eyes
and
here
added
my
visitor
opening
in
the
here
is
the
poem
that
to
your
mind
holds
all
the
philosophy
of
life
to
my
arms
my
beamish
boy
he
chortled
in
his
joy
i
blushed
and
trembled
blushed
that
he
should
discover
the
weakness
of
my
taste
trembled
at
his
power
i
do
blame
you
for
coloring
said
the
magician
but
i
thought
you
said
the
gutenberg
was
made
up
of
men
of
brains
do
you
think
you
could
stay
on
the
rolls
a
month
if
they
were
aware
that
your
poetic
ideals
are
summed
up
in
the
and
fits
my
taste
might
be
far
worse
i
answered
illustration
yes
it
might
you
might
have
stooped
to
liking
some
of
your
own
verses
i
ought
really
to
congratulate
you
i
suppose
retorted
the
visitor
with
a
sneering
laugh
this
roused
my
ire
again
who
are
you
anyhow
that
you
come
here
and
take
me
to
task
i
demanded
angrily
i
like
anything
i
please
and
without
asking
your
permission
if
i
cared
more
for
the
than
i
do
for
shakespeare
i
would
be
accountable
to
you
and
that
all
there
is
about
it
never
mind
who
i
am
said
the
visitor
suffice
to
say
that
i
am
myself
you
know
my
name
soon
enough
in
fact
you
will
pronounce
it
involuntarily
the
first
thing
when
you
wake
in
the
morning
and
then
here
he
shook
his
head
ominously
and
i
felt
myself
grow
rigid
with
fright
in
my
chair
now
for
the
final
trick
he
said
after
a
moment
pause
think
of
where
you
would
most
like
to
be
at
this
moment
and
i
exert
my
power
to
put
you
there
only
close
your
eyes
first
i
closed
my
eyes
and
wished
when
i
opened
them
i
was
in
the
of
the
gutenberg
club
with
perkins
and
tompson
for
heaven
sake
spencer
they
said
in
surprise
where
did
you
drop
in
from
why
man
you
are
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
what
a
necktie
take
it
off
grab
hold
of
me
boys
and
hold
me
fast
i
pleaded
falling
on
my
knees
in
terror
if
you
do
i
believe
i
die
the
idea
of
returning
to
my
sanctum
was
intolerably
dreadful
to
me
ha
ha
laughed
the
magician
for
even
as
i
spoke
to
perkins
and
tompson
i
found
myself
seated
opposite
my
infernal
visitor
in
my
room
once
more
they
could
keep
you
an
instant
with
me
summoning
you
back
his
laughter
was
terrible
his
frown
was
pleasanter
and
i
felt
myself
gradually
losing
control
of
my
senses
go
i
cried
leave
me
or
you
will
have
the
crime
of
murder
on
your
conscience
i
have
no
con
he
began
but
i
heard
no
more
that
is
the
last
i
remember
of
that
fearful
night
i
must
have
fainted
and
then
have
fallen
into
a
deep
slumber
illustration
when
i
waked
it
was
morning
and
i
was
alone
but
undressed
and
in
bed
unconscionably
weak
and
surrounded
by
medicine
bottles
of
many
kinds
the
clock
on
the
mantle
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
indicated
that
it
was
after
ten
beelzebub
i
cried
taking
note
of
the
hour
i
an
engagement
with
barlow
at
nine
and
then
a
woman
who
i
afterwards
learned
was
a
professional
nurse
entered
the
room
and
within
an
hour
i
realized
two
facts
one
was
that
i
had
lain
ill
for
many
days
and
that
my
engagement
with
barlow
was
now
for
six
weeks
unfulfilled
the
other
that
my
midnight
visitor
was
none
other
than
and
yet
i
do
know
his
tricks
certainly
were
worthy
of
that
individual
but
perkins
and
tompson
assert
that
i
never
entered
the
club
that
night
and
surely
if
my
visitor
was
beelzebub
himself
he
would
not
have
omitted
so
important
a
factor
of
success
as
my
actual
presence
in
the
on
that
occasion
would
have
been
and
besides
he
was
altogether
too
cool
to
have
come
from
his
reputed
residence
altogether
i
think
the
episode
most
unaccountable
particularly
when
i
reflect
that
while
no
trace
of
my
visitor
was
discoverable
in
my
room
the
next
morning
as
my
nurse
tells
me
my
blue
necktie
was
in
reality
found
upon
the
floor
crushed
and
torn
into
a
shapeless
bundle
of
frayed
rags
as
for
the
club
entertainment
i
am
told
that
despite
my
absence
it
was
a
wonderful
success
redeemed
from
failure
the
treasurer
of
the
club
said
by
the
voluntary
services
of
a
guest
who
secured
admittance
on
one
of
my
cards
and
who
executed
some
tricks
that
made
the
members
tremble
and
whose
feats
performed
on
the
butler
not
only
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
resign
his
office
but
disclosed
to
the
house
committee
the
whereabouts
of
several
cases
of
rare
wines
that
had
mysteriously
disappeared
a
quicksilver
cassandra
it
was
altogether
queer
and
jingleberry
to
this
day
does
not
entirely
understand
it
he
had
examined
his
heart
as
carefully
as
he
knew
how
and
had
arrived
at
the
entirely
reasonable
conclusion
that
he
was
in
love
he
had
every
symptom
of
that
malady
when
miss
marian
chapman
was
within
range
of
his
vision
there
was
room
for
no
one
else
there
he
suffered
from
that
peculiar
optical
condition
which
enabled
him
to
see
but
one
thing
at
a
time
when
she
was
present
and
she
was
that
one
thing
which
was
probably
the
reason
why
in
his
mind
eye
she
was
the
only
woman
in
the
world
for
marian
was
ever
present
before
jingleberry
mental
optic
he
had
also
examined
as
thoroughly
as
he
could
in
hypothesis
the
heart
of
this
only
woman
and
he
had
or
thought
he
had
which
amounts
to
the
same
thing
reason
to
believe
that
she
reciprocated
his
affection
she
certainly
seemed
glad
always
when
he
was
about
she
called
him
by
his
first
name
and
sometimes
quarrelled
with
him
as
she
quarrelled
with
no
one
else
and
if
that
was
a
sign
of
love
in
woman
then
jingleberry
had
studied
the
sex
all
his
years
and
they
were
for
nothing
in
short
marian
behaved
so
like
a
sister
to
him
that
jingleberry
knowing
how
dreams
and
women
go
by
contraries
was
absolutely
sure
that
a
sister
was
just
the
reverse
from
that
relationship
which
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
was
willing
to
assume
towards
him
and
he
was
happy
in
consequence
believing
this
it
was
not
at
all
strange
that
he
should
make
up
his
mind
to
propose
marriage
to
her
though
like
many
other
men
he
was
somewhat
in
coming
to
the
point
four
times
had
he
called
upon
marian
for
the
sole
purpose
of
asking
her
to
become
his
wife
and
four
times
had
he
led
up
to
the
point
and
then
talked
about
something
else
what
quality
it
is
in
man
that
makes
a
coward
of
him
in
the
presence
of
one
he
considers
his
dearest
friend
is
not
within
the
province
of
this
narrative
to
determine
but
jingleberry
had
it
in
its
most
virulent
form
he
had
often
got
so
far
along
in
his
proposal
as
marian
er
will
you
will
you
and
there
he
had
as
often
stopped
contenting
himself
with
such
commonplace
conclusions
as
go
to
the
matinee
with
me
or
ask
your
father
for
me
if
he
thinks
the
stock
market
is
likely
to
strengthen
soon
and
other
amazing
substitutes
for
the
words
he
so
ardently
desired
yet
feared
to
utter
but
this
afternoon
the
one
upon
which
the
extraordinary
events
about
to
be
narrated
took
place
jingleberry
had
called
resolved
not
to
be
balked
in
his
determination
to
learn
his
fate
he
had
come
to
propose
and
propose
he
would
his
confidence
in
a
successful
termination
to
his
suit
had
been
reinforced
that
very
morning
by
the
receipt
of
a
note
from
miss
chapman
asking
him
to
dine
with
her
parents
and
herself
that
evening
and
to
accompany
them
after
dinner
to
the
opera
surely
that
meant
a
great
deal
and
jingleberry
conceived
that
the
time
was
ripe
for
a
blushing
yes
to
his
question
so
he
was
here
in
the
chapman
parlor
waiting
for
the
young
lady
to
come
down
and
become
the
recipient
of
the
interesting
interrogatory
as
it
is
called
in
some
sections
of
massachusetts
i
ask
her
the
first
thing
said
jingleberry
buttoning
up
his
prince
albert
as
though
to
impart
a
possibly
needed
stiffening
to
his
backbone
she
will
say
yes
and
then
i
shall
enjoy
the
dinner
and
the
opera
so
much
the
more
ahem
i
wonder
if
i
am
pale
i
feel
sort
of
um
there
a
mirror
that
will
tell
jingleberry
walked
to
the
mirror
an
oval
mirror
such
as
was
very
much
the
vogue
fifty
years
ago
for
which
reason
alone
no
doubt
it
was
now
admitted
to
the
parlor
of
the
house
of
chapman
blessed
things
these
mirrors
said
jingleberry
gazing
at
the
reflection
of
his
face
so
reassuring
i
not
at
all
pale
quite
the
contrary
red
as
a
sunset
good
omen
that
the
sun
is
setting
on
my
bachelor
days
and
my
scarf
is
crooked
ah
the
ejaculation
was
one
of
pleasure
for
pictured
in
the
mirror
jingleberry
saw
the
form
of
marian
entering
the
room
through
the
portieres
how
do
you
do
marian
been
admiring
myself
in
the
glass
he
said
turning
to
greet
her
i
er
here
he
stopped
as
well
he
might
for
he
addressed
no
one
miss
chapman
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
dear
me
said
jingleberry
rubbing
his
eyes
in
astonishment
how
extraordinary
i
surely
thought
i
saw
her
why
i
did
see
her
that
is
i
saw
her
reflection
in
the
gla
ha
ha
she
caught
me
gazing
at
myself
there
and
has
hidden
he
walked
to
the
door
and
drew
the
portiere
aside
and
looked
into
the
hall
there
was
no
one
there
he
searched
every
corner
of
the
hall
and
of
the
at
its
end
and
then
returned
to
the
parlor
but
it
was
still
empty
and
then
occurred
the
most
strangely
unaccountable
event
in
his
life
as
he
looked
about
the
parlor
he
for
the
second
time
found
himself
before
the
mirror
but
the
reflection
therein
though
it
was
of
himself
was
of
himself
with
his
back
turned
to
his
real
self
as
he
stood
gazing
amazedly
into
the
glass
and
besides
this
although
jingleberry
was
alone
in
the
real
parlor
the
reflection
of
the
dainty
room
showed
that
there
he
was
not
so
for
seated
in
her
accustomed
graceful
attitude
in
the
reflected
was
nothing
less
than
the
counterfeit
presentment
of
marian
chapman
herself
it
was
a
wonder
jingleberry
eyes
did
not
fall
out
of
his
head
he
stared
so
what
a
situation
it
was
to
be
sure
to
stand
there
and
see
in
the
glass
a
scene
which
as
far
as
he
could
observe
had
no
basis
in
reality
and
how
interesting
it
was
for
jingleberry
to
watch
himself
going
through
the
form
of
chatting
pleasantly
there
in
the
mirror
depths
with
the
woman
he
loved
it
almost
made
him
jealous
though
the
reflected
jingleberry
was
so
entirely
independent
of
the
real
jingleberry
the
jealousy
soon
gave
way
to
consternation
for
to
the
wondering
suitor
the
independent
reflection
was
beginning
to
do
that
for
which
he
himself
had
come
in
other
words
there
was
a
proposal
going
on
there
in
the
glass
and
jingleberry
enjoyed
the
novel
sensation
of
seeing
how
he
himself
would
look
when
passing
through
a
similar
ordeal
altogether
however
it
was
not
as
pleasing
as
most
novelties
are
for
there
were
distinct
signs
in
the
face
of
the
mirrored
marian
that
the
mirrored
jingleberry
words
were
distasteful
to
her
and
that
the
proposition
he
was
making
was
not
one
she
could
entertain
under
any
circumstances
she
kept
shaking
her
head
and
the
more
she
shook
it
the
more
the
glazed
jingleberry
seemed
to
implore
her
to
be
his
finally
jingleberry
saw
his
quicksilver
counterpart
fall
upon
his
knees
before
marian
of
the
glass
and
hold
out
his
arms
and
hands
towards
her
in
an
attitude
of
prayerful
despair
whereupon
the
girl
sprang
to
her
feet
stamped
her
left
foot
furiously
upon
the
floor
and
pointed
the
unwelcome
lover
to
the
door
jingleberry
was
fairly
staggered
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
so
extraordinary
a
freak
of
nature
surely
it
must
be
prophetic
fate
was
kind
enough
to
warn
him
in
advance
no
doubt
otherwise
it
was
a
trick
and
why
should
she
stoop
to
play
so
paltry
a
trick
as
that
upon
him
surely
fate
would
not
be
so
petty
no
it
was
a
warning
the
mirror
had
been
so
affected
by
some
supernatural
agency
that
it
divined
and
reflected
that
which
was
to
be
instead
of
confining
itself
to
what
jingleberry
called
simultaneity
it
led
instead
of
following
or
acting
coincidently
with
the
reality
and
it
was
the
part
of
wisdom
he
thought
for
him
to
yield
to
its
suggestion
and
retreat
and
as
he
thought
this
he
heard
a
soft
sweet
voice
behind
him
i
hope
you
have
got
tired
of
waiting
tom
it
said
and
turning
jingleberry
saw
the
unquestionably
real
marian
standing
in
the
doorway
no
he
answered
shortly
i
i
have
had
a
pleasant
very
entertaining
ten
minutes
but
i
i
must
hurry
along
marian
he
added
i
only
came
to
tell
you
that
i
have
a
frightful
headache
and
er
i
ca
very
well
manage
to
come
to
dinner
or
go
to
the
opera
with
you
why
tom
pouted
marian
i
am
awfully
disappointed
i
had
counted
on
you
and
now
my
whole
evening
will
be
spoiled
do
you
think
you
can
rest
a
little
while
and
then
come
well
i
i
want
to
marian
said
jingleberry
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
i
really
am
afraid
i
am
going
to
be
ill
i
had
such
a
strange
experience
this
afternoon
i
tell
me
what
it
was
suggested
marian
sympathetically
and
jingleberry
did
tell
her
what
it
was
he
told
her
the
whole
story
from
beginning
to
end
what
he
had
come
for
how
he
had
happened
to
look
in
the
mirror
and
what
he
saw
there
and
marian
listened
attentively
to
every
word
he
said
she
laughed
once
or
twice
and
when
he
had
done
she
reminded
him
that
mirrors
have
a
habit
of
reversing
everything
and
somehow
or
other
jingleberry
headache
went
and
and
well
everything
went
the
ghost
club
an
unfortunate
episode
in
the
life
of
no
number
was
at
the
time
when
i
received
the
details
of
this
story
from
his
lips
a
stalwart
man
of
swart
of
hue
of
pleasing
address
and
altogether
the
last
person
one
would
take
for
a
convict
serving
a
term
for
the
only
outer
symptoms
of
his
actual
condition
were
the
striped
suit
he
wore
the
style
and
cut
of
which
are
still
in
vogue
at
sing
sing
prison
and
the
closely
cropped
hair
which
showed
off
the
distinctly
intellectual
lines
of
his
head
to
great
advantage
he
was
engaged
in
making
shoes
when
i
first
saw
him
and
so
impressed
was
i
with
the
contrast
between
his
really
refined
features
and
grace
of
manner
and
those
of
his
companions
that
i
asked
my
guide
who
he
was
and
what
were
the
circumstances
which
had
brought
him
to
sing
sing
illustration
he
pegs
shoes
like
a
gentleman
i
said
yes
returned
the
keeper
he
werry
troublesome
that
way
he
thinks
he
too
good
for
his
position
we
ca
never
do
nothing
with
the
boots
he
makes
why
do
you
keep
him
at
work
in
the
shoe
department
i
queried
we
have
got
no
work
to
be
done
in
his
special
line
so
we
have
to
put
him
at
whatever
we
can
he
pegs
shoes
less
badly
than
he
does
anything
else
what
was
his
special
line
he
was
a
gentleman
of
leisure
travellin
for
his
health
afore
he
got
into
the
toils
o
the
law
his
real
name
is
marmaduke
fitztappington
de
wolfe
of
warwickshire
he
landed
in
this
country
of
a
tuesday
took
to
collectin
souvenir
spoons
of
a
friday
was
jugged
the
same
day
tried
convicted
and
there
he
sets
in
for
two
years
more
how
interesting
i
said
was
the
evidence
against
him
conclusive
extremely
a
spoons
was
found
on
his
person
he
pleaded
guilty
i
suppose
not
him
he
claimed
to
be
as
innocent
as
a
babe
told
a
story
about
havin
been
deluded
by
spirits
but
the
judge
and
jury
was
to
be
fooled
they
gave
him
every
chance
too
he
even
cabled
himself
the
judge
did
to
warwickshire
at
his
own
expense
to
see
if
the
man
was
an
impostor
but
he
never
got
no
reply
there
was
them
as
said
there
was
no
such
place
as
in
warwickshire
but
they
never
proved
it
i
should
like
very
much
to
interview
him
said
i
it
ca
be
done
sir
said
my
guide
the
rules
is
very
strict
you
could
er
arrange
an
interview
for
me
i
asked
jingling
a
bunch
of
keys
in
my
pocket
he
must
have
recognized
the
sound
for
he
colored
and
gruffly
replied
i
has
me
orders
and
i
obeys
just
er
add
this
to
the
pension
fund
i
put
in
handing
him
a
bill
an
interview
is
impossible
eh
illustration
i
did
say
impossible
he
answered
with
a
grateful
smile
i
said
against
the
rules
but
we
has
been
known
to
make
exceptions
i
think
i
can
fix
you
up
suffice
it
to
say
that
he
did
fix
me
up
and
that
two
hours
later
and
i
sat
down
together
in
the
cell
of
the
former
a
not
too
commodious
stall
and
had
a
pleasant
chat
in
the
course
of
which
he
told
me
the
story
of
his
life
which
as
i
had
surmised
was
to
me
at
least
exceedingly
interesting
and
easily
worth
twice
the
amount
of
my
contribution
to
the
pension
fund
under
the
management
of
my
guide
of
the
morning
my
real
name
said
the
unfortunate
convict
as
you
may
already
have
guessed
is
not
that
is
an
alias
forced
upon
me
by
the
state
authorities
my
name
is
really
austin
merton
surrennes
ahem
i
said
then
my
guide
erred
this
morning
when
he
told
me
that
in
reality
you
were
marmaduke
fitztappington
de
wolfe
of
warwickshire
number
laughed
long
and
loud
of
course
he
erred
you
do
suppose
that
i
would
give
the
authorities
my
real
name
do
you
why
man
i
am
a
nephew
i
have
an
aged
uncle
a
rich
millionaire
uncle
whose
heart
and
will
it
would
break
were
he
to
hear
of
my
present
plight
both
the
heart
and
will
are
in
my
favor
hence
my
tender
solicitude
for
him
i
am
innocent
of
course
convicts
always
are
you
know
but
that
would
make
any
difference
he
die
of
mortification
just
the
same
it
one
of
our
family
traits
that
so
i
gave
a
false
name
to
the
authorities
and
secretly
informed
my
uncle
that
i
was
about
to
set
out
for
a
walking
trip
across
the
great
american
desert
requesting
him
not
to
worry
if
he
did
not
hear
from
me
for
a
number
of
years
america
being
in
a
state
of
to
which
mails
outside
of
certain
districts
are
entirely
unknown
my
uncle
being
an
englishman
and
a
conservative
gentleman
addicted
more
to
reading
than
to
travel
accepts
the
information
as
veracious
and
suspects
nothing
and
when
i
am
liberated
i
shall
return
to
him
and
at
his
death
shall
become
a
conservative
man
of
wealth
myself
see
but
if
you
are
innocent
and
he
rich
and
influential
why
did
you
not
appeal
to
him
to
save
you
i
asked
because
i
was
afraid
that
he
like
the
rest
of
the
world
would
decline
to
believe
my
defence
sighed
it
was
a
good
defence
if
the
judge
had
only
known
it
and
i
proud
of
it
but
ineffectual
i
put
in
and
so
not
good
alas
yes
this
is
an
incredulous
age
people
particularly
judges
are
practical
men
of
affairs
my
defence
was
suited
more
for
an
age
of
mystical
tendencies
why
will
you
believe
it
sir
my
own
lawyer
the
man
to
whom
i
paid
eighteen
dollars
and
cents
for
championing
my
cause
told
me
the
defence
was
rubbish
devoid
even
of
literary
merit
what
chance
could
a
man
have
if
his
lawyer
even
believe
in
him
none
i
answered
sadly
and
you
had
no
chance
at
all
though
innocent
yes
i
had
one
and
i
chose
not
to
take
it
i
might
have
proved
myself
compos
but
that
involved
my
making
a
fool
of
myself
in
public
before
a
jury
and
i
have
too
much
dignity
for
that
i
can
tell
you
i
told
my
lawyer
that
i
should
prefer
a
felon
cell
to
the
richly
furnished
flat
of
a
wealthy
lunatic
to
which
he
replied
all
is
lost
and
so
it
was
i
read
my
defence
in
court
the
judge
laughed
the
jury
whispered
and
i
was
convicted
instanter
of
stealing
spoons
when
murder
itself
was
no
further
from
my
thoughts
than
theft
but
they
tell
me
you
were
caught
said
i
were
not
a
spoons
found
upon
your
person
in
my
hand
returned
the
prisoner
the
spoons
were
in
my
hand
when
i
was
arrested
and
they
were
seen
there
by
the
owner
by
the
police
and
by
the
usual
crowd
of
small
boys
that
congregate
at
such
embarrassing
moments
springing
up
out
of
sidewalks
dropping
down
from
the
heavens
swarming
in
from
everywhere
i
had
no
idea
there
were
so
many
small
boys
in
the
world
until
i
was
arrested
and
found
myself
the
cynosure
of
a
million
or
more
innocent
blue
eyes
illustration
were
they
all
i
queried
thinking
the
point
interesting
from
a
scientific
point
of
view
hoping
to
discover
that
curiosity
of
a
morbid
character
was
always
found
in
connection
with
eyes
of
a
specified
hue
oh
no
i
fancy
not
returned
my
host
but
to
a
man
with
a
load
of
another
fellow
spoons
in
his
possession
and
a
pair
of
handcuffs
on
his
wrists
everything
looks
blue
i
do
doubt
it
i
replied
but
er
just
how
now
could
you
defend
yourself
when
every
bit
of
evidence
and
you
will
excuse
me
for
saying
so
conclusive
evidence
at
that
pointed
to
your
guilt
the
spoons
were
a
gift
he
answered
but
the
owner
denied
that
i
know
it
that
where
the
beastly
part
of
it
all
came
in
they
were
not
given
to
me
by
the
owner
but
by
a
lot
of
mean
ghosts
number
anger
as
he
spoke
these
words
was
terrible
to
witness
and
as
he
strode
up
and
down
the
floor
of
his
cell
and
dashed
his
arms
right
and
left
i
wished
for
a
moment
that
i
was
elsewhere
i
should
not
have
flown
however
even
had
the
cell
door
been
open
and
my
way
clear
for
his
suggestion
of
a
supernatural
agency
in
connection
with
his
crime
whetted
my
curiosity
until
it
was
more
keen
than
ever
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
hear
the
story
to
the
end
if
i
had
to
commit
a
crime
and
get
myself
sentenced
to
confinement
in
that
prison
for
life
to
do
so
fortunately
extreme
measures
of
this
nature
were
unnecessary
for
after
a
few
moments
surrennes
calmed
down
and
seating
himself
beside
me
on
the
cot
drained
his
to
the
dregs
and
began
excuse
me
for
not
offering
you
a
drink
he
said
but
the
wine
they
serve
here
while
moist
is
hardly
what
a
connoisseur
would
choose
except
for
bathing
purposes
and
i
compliment
you
by
assuming
that
you
do
not
wish
to
taste
it
thank
you
i
said
i
do
not
like
to
take
water
straight
exactly
i
always
dilute
it
in
fact
with
a
little
of
this
here
i
extracted
a
small
flask
from
my
pocket
and
handed
it
to
him
ah
he
said
smacking
his
lips
as
he
took
a
long
pull
at
its
contents
that
puts
spirit
into
a
man
yes
it
does
i
replied
ruefully
as
i
noted
that
he
had
left
me
very
little
but
the
flask
but
i
do
think
it
was
necessary
for
you
to
deprive
me
of
all
mine
no
that
is
you
ca
appreciate
the
necessity
unless
you
er
you
have
suffered
in
your
life
as
i
am
suffering
you
were
never
sent
up
yourself
i
gave
him
a
glance
which
was
all
indignation
i
guess
not
i
said
i
have
led
a
life
that
is
above
reproach
good
he
replied
and
what
a
satisfaction
that
is
eh
i
do
believe
i
be
able
to
stand
this
jail
life
if
it
was
for
my
conscience
which
is
as
clear
and
clean
as
it
would
be
if
i
never
used
it
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
your
defence
was
i
asked
certainly
not
said
he
cheerfully
i
be
very
glad
to
give
it
to
you
but
you
must
remember
one
thing
it
is
copyrighted
fire
ahead
i
said
with
a
smile
i
respect
your
copyright
give
you
a
royalty
on
what
i
get
for
the
story
very
good
he
answered
it
was
like
this
to
begin
i
must
tell
you
that
when
i
was
a
boy
preparing
for
college
i
had
for
a
chum
a
brilliant
fellow
named
hawley
hicks
concerning
whose
future
various
prophecies
had
been
made
his
mother
often
asserted
that
he
would
be
a
great
poet
his
father
thought
he
was
born
to
be
a
great
general
our
at
the
scarberry
institute
for
young
gentlemen
prophesied
the
gallows
they
were
all
wrong
though
for
myself
i
think
that
if
he
had
lived
long
enough
almost
any
one
of
the
prophecies
might
have
come
true
the
trouble
was
that
hawley
died
at
the
age
of
fifteen
years
elapsed
i
was
graduated
with
high
honors
at
brazenose
lived
a
life
of
elegant
leisure
and
at
the
age
of
broke
down
in
health
that
was
about
a
year
ago
my
uncle
whose
heir
and
constant
companion
i
was
gave
me
a
liberal
allowance
and
sent
me
off
to
travel
i
came
to
america
landed
in
new
york
early
in
september
and
set
about
winning
back
the
color
which
had
departed
from
my
cheeks
by
an
assiduous
devotion
to
such
pleasures
as
new
york
affords
two
days
after
my
arrival
i
set
out
for
an
airing
at
coney
island
leaving
my
hotel
at
four
in
the
afternoon
on
my
way
down
broadway
i
was
suddenly
startled
at
hearing
my
name
spoken
from
behind
me
and
appalled
on
turning
to
see
standing
with
outstretched
hands
no
less
a
person
than
my
defunct
chum
hawley
hicks
illustration
impossible
said
i
exactly
my
remark
returned
number
to
which
i
added
hicks
it
ca
be
you
it
is
me
he
replied
and
then
i
was
convinced
for
hawley
never
was
good
on
his
grammar
i
looked
at
him
a
minute
and
then
i
said
hawley
i
thought
you
were
dead
am
he
answered
why
should
a
little
thing
like
that
stand
between
friends
should
hawley
i
answered
meekly
it
condemnedly
unusual
you
know
for
a
man
to
associate
even
with
his
best
friends
fifteen
years
after
they
died
and
been
buried
you
mean
to
say
austin
that
just
because
i
was
weak
enough
once
to
succumb
to
a
bad
cold
you
the
dearest
friend
of
my
youth
the
closest
companion
of
my
the
partner
of
my
childish
joys
intend
to
go
back
on
me
here
in
a
strange
city
i
answered
huskily
a
bit
of
it
my
letter
of
credit
my
room
at
the
hotel
my
dress
suit
even
my
ticket
to
coney
island
are
at
your
disposal
but
i
think
the
partner
of
your
childish
joys
ought
first
to
be
let
in
on
the
of
this
enterprise
and
informed
how
the
deuce
you
manage
to
turn
up
in
new
york
fifteen
years
subsequent
to
your
obsequies
is
new
york
the
hereafter
for
boys
of
your
kind
or
is
this
some
freak
of
my
imagination
that
was
an
eminently
proper
question
i
put
in
just
to
show
that
while
the
story
i
was
hearing
terrified
me
i
was
not
altogether
speechless
it
was
indeed
said
and
hawley
recognized
it
as
such
for
he
replied
at
once
said
he
imagination
is
all
right
and
new
york
is
neither
heaven
nor
the
other
place
the
fact
is
i
spooking
and
i
can
tell
you
austin
it
just
about
the
finest
kind
of
work
there
is
if
you
could
manage
to
shuffle
off
your
mortal
coil
and
get
in
with
a
lot
of
ghosts
the
way
i
have
you
be
playing
in
great
luck
for
the
hint
hawley
i
said
with
a
grateful
smile
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
not
find
that
life
is
entirely
bad
i
get
my
three
meals
a
day
keep
my
pocket
full
of
coin
and
sleep
eight
hours
every
night
on
a
couch
that
could
be
more
desirable
if
it
were
studded
with
jewels
and
had
mineral
springs
your
mortal
ignorance
austin
he
retorted
lived
long
enough
to
appreciate
the
necessity
of
being
ignorant
but
your
style
of
existence
is
really
not
to
be
mentioned
in
the
same
cycle
with
mine
you
talk
about
three
meals
a
day
as
if
that
were
an
ideal
you
forget
that
with
the
eating
your
labor
is
just
begun
those
meals
have
to
be
digested
every
one
of
and
if
you
could
only
understand
it
it
would
appall
you
to
see
what
a
fearful
wear
and
tear
that
act
of
digestion
is
in
my
life
you
are
feasting
all
the
time
but
with
no
need
for
digestion
you
speak
of
money
in
your
pockets
well
i
have
none
yet
am
i
the
richer
of
the
two
i
do
need
money
the
world
is
mine
if
i
chose
to
i
could
pour
the
contents
of
that
jeweller
window
into
your
lap
in
five
seconds
but
the
gems
delight
my
eye
quite
as
well
where
they
are
and
as
for
travel
austin
of
which
you
have
always
been
fond
the
spectral
method
beats
all
just
watch
me
i
watched
him
as
well
as
i
could
for
a
minute
said
and
then
he
disappeared
in
another
minute
he
was
before
me
again
i
said
suppose
you
been
around
the
block
in
that
time
eh
he
roared
with
laughter
the
block
he
ejaculated
have
done
the
continent
of
europe
taken
a
run
through
china
haunted
the
emperor
of
japan
and
sailed
around
the
horn
since
i
left
you
a
minute
ago
illustration
he
was
a
truthful
boy
in
spite
of
his
peculiarities
hawley
was
said
surrennes
quietly
so
i
had
to
believe
what
he
said
he
abhorred
lies
that
was
pretty
fast
travelling
though
said
i
he
make
a
fine
that
so
i
wish
i
suggested
it
to
him
smiled
my
host
but
i
can
tell
you
sir
i
was
astonished
i
said
always
were
a
fast
youth
but
i
never
thought
you
would
develop
into
this
i
wonder
not
out
of
breath
after
such
a
journey
point
my
dear
austin
in
favor
of
my
mode
of
existence
we
spooks
have
no
breath
to
begin
with
consequently
to
get
out
of
it
is
no
deprivation
but
i
say
he
added
are
you
bound
coney
island
to
see
the
sights
i
replied
you
join
me
i
he
replied
island
is
tame
when
i
first
joined
the
spectre
band
it
seemed
to
me
that
nothing
could
delight
me
more
than
an
eternal
round
of
gayety
like
that
but
austin
i
have
changed
i
have
developed
a
good
deal
since
you
and
i
were
parted
at
the
grave
should
say
you
had
i
answered
doubt
if
many
of
your
old
friends
would
know
you
seem
to
have
had
difficulty
in
so
doing
yourself
austin
he
replied
regretfully
see
here
old
chap
give
up
coney
island
and
spend
the
evening
with
me
at
the
club
you
have
a
good
time
i
can
assure
you
club
i
said
do
mean
to
say
you
visions
have
a
club
do
indeed
the
ghost
club
is
the
most
flourishing
association
of
choice
spirits
in
the
world
we
have
rooms
in
every
city
in
creation
and
the
finest
part
of
it
is
there
are
no
dues
to
be
paid
the
membership
list
holds
some
of
the
finest
names
in
history
shakespeare
milton
chaucer
napoleon
bonaparte
caesar
george
washington
mozart
frederick
the
great
marc
antony
cassius
was
on
caesar
account
galileo
confucius
illustration
admit
the
chinese
eh
i
queried
always
he
replied
con
was
such
a
good
fellow
they
had
the
heart
to
keep
him
out
but
you
see
austin
what
a
lot
of
fine
fellows
there
are
in
it
it
a
magnificent
list
and
i
should
say
they
made
a
pretty
interesting
set
of
fellows
to
hear
talk
i
put
in
rather
hawley
replied
wish
you
could
have
heard
a
debate
between
shakespeare
and
caesar
on
the
resolution
the
pen
is
mightier
than
the
sword
it
was
immense
should
think
it
might
have
been
i
said
won
sword
party
they
were
the
best
fighters
though
on
the
merits
of
the
argument
shakespeare
was
ahead
i
thought
i
stand
a
chance
of
seeing
spooks
like
that
i
think
give
up
coney
island
and
go
with
you
i
said
replied
hawley
just
the
kind
of
a
chance
you
do
stand
they
all
be
there
and
as
this
is
ladies
day
you
might
meet
lucretia
borgia
cleopatra
and
a
few
other
feminine
apparitions
of
considerable
note
settles
it
i
am
yours
for
the
rest
of
the
day
i
said
and
so
we
adjourned
to
the
rooms
of
the
ghost
club
these
rooms
were
in
a
beautiful
house
on
fifth
avenue
the
number
of
the
house
you
will
find
on
consulting
the
court
records
i
have
forgotten
it
it
was
a
large
broad
structure
and
must
have
been
over
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
depth
such
fittings
i
never
saw
before
everything
was
in
the
height
of
luxury
and
i
am
quite
certain
that
among
beings
to
whom
money
is
a
measure
of
possibility
no
such
magnificence
is
attainable
the
paintings
on
the
walls
were
by
the
most
famous
artists
of
our
own
and
other
days
the
rugs
on
the
superbly
polished
floors
were
worth
fortunes
not
only
for
their
exquisite
beauty
but
also
for
their
extreme
rarity
in
keeping
with
these
were
the
furniture
and
in
short
my
dear
sir
i
had
never
dreamed
of
anything
so
dazzlingly
so
superbly
magnificent
as
that
apartment
into
which
i
was
ushered
by
the
ghost
of
my
quondam
friend
hawley
hicks
illustration
at
first
i
was
speechless
with
wonder
which
seemed
to
amuse
hicks
very
much
fine
eh
he
said
with
a
short
laugh
i
replied
in
a
moment
that
you
can
get
along
without
money
and
that
all
the
resources
of
the
world
are
at
your
disposal
it
is
not
more
than
half
bad
have
you
a
library
i
was
always
fond
of
books
explained
in
parenthesis
to
me
and
so
was
quite
anxious
to
see
what
the
club
of
ghosts
could
show
in
the
way
of
literary
treasures
imagine
my
surprise
when
hawley
informed
me
that
the
club
had
no
collection
of
the
sort
to
appeal
to
the
bibliophile
he
answered
have
no
library
strange
i
said
a
club
to
which
men
like
shakespeare
milton
edgar
allan
poe
and
other
deceased
literati
belong
should
be
deficient
in
that
respect
at
all
said
he
should
we
want
books
when
we
have
the
men
themselves
to
tell
their
tales
to
us
would
you
give
a
rap
to
possess
a
set
of
shakespeare
if
william
himself
would
sit
down
and
rattle
off
the
whole
business
to
you
any
time
you
chose
to
ask
him
to
do
it
would
you
follow
scott
printed
narratives
through
their
devious
and
tedious
periods
if
sir
walter
in
spirit
would
come
to
you
on
demand
and
tell
you
all
the
old
stories
over
again
in
a
tenth
part
of
the
time
it
would
take
you
to
read
the
introduction
to
one
of
them
fancy
not
i
said
you
in
such
luck
am
said
hawley
personally
i
never
send
for
scott
or
shakespeare
i
prefer
something
lighter
than
either
douglas
jerrold
or
marryat
but
best
of
all
i
like
to
sit
down
and
hear
noah
swap
animal
stories
with
davy
crockett
noah
the
brightest
man
of
his
age
in
the
club
adam
kind
of
slow
about
solomon
i
asked
more
to
be
flippant
than
with
any
desire
for
information
i
was
much
amused
to
hear
hawley
speak
of
these
great
spirits
as
if
he
and
they
were
chums
of
long
standing
illustration
has
resigned
from
the
club
he
said
with
a
sad
sigh
was
a
good
fellow
solomon
was
but
he
thought
he
knew
it
all
until
old
doctor
johnson
got
hold
of
him
and
then
he
knuckled
under
it
rather
rough
for
a
man
to
get
firmly
established
in
his
belief
that
he
is
the
wisest
creature
going
and
then
after
a
couple
of
thousand
years
have
an
englishman
come
along
and
tell
him
things
he
never
knew
before
especially
the
way
sam
johnson
delivers
himself
of
his
opinions
johnson
never
cared
whom
he
hurt
you
know
and
when
he
got
after
solomon
he
did
it
with
all
his
might
i
wonder
if
boswell
was
there
i
ventured
interrupting
in
his
extraordinary
narrative
for
an
instant
yes
he
was
there
returned
the
prisoner
i
met
him
later
in
the
evening
but
he
is
the
spook
he
might
be
he
never
had
much
spirit
anyhow
and
when
he
died
he
had
to
leave
his
nose
behind
him
and
that
settled
him
of
course
i
answered
boswell
with
no
nose
to
stick
into
other
people
affairs
would
have
been
like
with
desdemona
left
out
but
go
on
what
did
you
do
next
well
resumed
after
i
looked
about
me
and
drunk
my
fill
of
the
magnificence
on
every
hand
hawley
took
me
into
the
and
introduced
me
to
mozart
and
wagner
and
a
few
other
great
composers
in
response
to
my
request
wagner
played
an
impromptu
version
of
bell
on
the
organ
it
was
great
not
much
like
bell
of
course
more
like
a
collision
between
a
cyclone
and
a
simoom
in
a
mining
camp
in
fact
but
nevertheless
marvellous
i
tried
to
remember
it
afterwards
and
jotted
down
a
few
notes
but
i
found
the
first
bar
took
up
seven
sheets
of
and
so
gave
it
up
then
mozart
tried
his
hand
on
a
banjo
for
my
amusement
mendelssohn
sang
a
of
his
songs
without
words
and
then
gottschalk
played
one
of
poe
weird
stories
on
the
piano
then
carlyle
came
in
and
hawley
introduced
me
to
him
he
was
a
gruff
old
gentleman
and
seemingly
anxious
to
have
froude
become
an
eligible
and
i
judged
from
the
rather
fierce
manner
in
which
he
handled
a
club
he
had
in
his
hand
that
there
were
one
or
two
other
men
of
prominence
still
living
he
was
anxious
to
meet
dickens
too
was
desirous
of
a
interview
with
certain
of
his
at
present
purely
mortal
critics
and
between
you
and
me
if
the
wink
that
bacon
gave
shakespeare
when
i
spoke
of
ignatius
donnelly
meant
anything
the
famous
cryptogrammarian
will
do
well
to
drink
a
bottle
of
the
elixir
of
life
every
morning
before
breakfast
and
stave
off
dissolution
as
long
as
he
can
there
no
getting
around
the
fact
sir
surrennes
added
with
a
significant
shake
of
the
head
that
the
present
leaders
of
literary
thought
with
critical
tendencies
are
going
to
have
the
hardest
kind
of
a
time
when
they
cross
the
river
and
apply
for
admission
to
the
ghost
club
do
ask
for
any
better
fun
than
that
of
watching
from
a
safe
distance
the
initiation
ceremonies
of
the
next
dozen
who
go
over
and
as
an
englishman
sir
who
thoroughly
believes
in
and
admires
lord
wolseley
if
i
were
out
of
jail
and
able
to
do
it
i
write
him
a
letter
and
warn
him
that
he
would
better
revise
his
estimates
of
certain
famous
soldiers
no
longer
living
if
he
desires
to
find
rest
in
that
mysterious
other
world
whither
he
must
eventually
betake
himself
they
got
their
swords
sharpened
for
him
and
he
discover
an
instance
when
he
gets
over
there
in
which
the
sword
is
mightier
than
the
pen
illustration
after
that
hawley
took
me
and
introduced
me
to
the
spirit
of
napoleon
bonaparte
with
whom
i
passed
about
minutes
talking
over
his
victories
and
defeats
he
told
me
he
never
could
understand
how
a
man
like
wellington
came
to
defeat
him
at
waterloo
and
added
that
he
had
sounded
the
iron
duke
on
the
subject
and
found
him
equally
ignorant
so
the
afternoon
and
evening
passed
i
met
quite
a
number
of
famous
ladies
catherine
marie
louise
josephine
queen
elizabeth
and
others
talked
architecture
with
queen
anne
and
was
surprised
to
learn
that
she
never
saw
a
queen
anne
cottage
i
took
peg
woffington
down
to
supper
and
altogether
had
a
fine
time
of
it
illustration
but
my
dear
surrennes
i
put
in
at
this
point
i
fail
to
see
what
this
has
to
do
with
your
defence
in
your
trial
for
stealing
spoons
i
am
coming
to
that
said
sadly
i
dwell
on
the
moments
passed
at
the
club
because
they
were
the
happiest
of
my
life
and
am
loath
to
speak
of
what
followed
but
i
suppose
i
must
it
was
all
due
to
queen
isabella
that
i
got
into
trouble
peg
woffington
presented
me
to
queen
isabella
in
the
and
while
her
majesty
and
i
were
talking
i
spoke
of
how
beautiful
everything
in
the
club
was
and
admired
especially
a
old
spanish
spoons
upon
the
when
i
had
done
this
the
queen
called
to
ferdinand
who
was
chatting
with
columbus
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
to
come
to
her
which
he
did
with
alacrity
i
was
presented
to
the
king
and
then
my
troubles
began
surrennes
admires
our
spoons
ferdinand
said
the
queen
the
king
smiled
and
turning
to
me
observed
they
are
yours
er
waiter
just
do
these
spoons
up
and
give
them
to
mr
surrennes
of
course
said
i
protested
against
this
whereupon
the
king
looked
displeased
is
a
rule
of
our
club
sir
as
well
as
an
old
spanish
custom
for
us
to
present
to
our
guests
anything
that
they
may
happen
openly
to
admire
you
are
surely
sufficiently
well
acquainted
with
the
etiquette
of
club
life
to
know
that
guests
may
not
with
propriety
decline
to
be
governed
by
the
regulations
of
the
club
whose
hospitality
they
are
enjoying
certainly
am
aware
of
that
my
dear
king
i
replied
of
course
i
accept
the
spoons
with
exceeding
deep
gratitude
my
remonstrance
was
prompted
solely
by
my
desire
to
explain
to
you
that
i
was
unaware
of
any
such
regulation
and
to
assure
you
that
when
i
ventured
to
inform
your
good
wife
that
the
spoons
had
excited
my
sincerest
admiration
i
was
not
hinting
that
it
would
please
me
greatly
to
be
accounted
their
possessor
courtly
speech
sir
returned
the
king
with
a
low
bow
ample
assurance
of
your
sincerity
and
i
beg
that
you
will
put
the
spoons
in
your
pocket
and
say
no
more
they
are
yours
illustration
i
thanked
the
great
spaniard
and
said
no
more
pocketing
the
spoons
with
no
little
exultation
because
having
always
been
a
lover
of
the
quaint
and
beautiful
i
was
glad
to
possess
such
treasures
though
i
must
confess
to
some
misgivings
as
to
the
possibility
of
their
being
unreal
shortly
after
this
episode
i
looked
at
my
watch
and
discovered
that
it
was
getting
well
on
towards
eleven
and
i
sought
out
hawley
for
the
purpose
of
thanking
him
for
a
delightful
evening
and
of
taking
my
leave
i
met
him
in
the
hall
talking
to
euripides
on
the
subject
of
the
amateur
stage
in
the
united
states
what
they
said
i
did
not
stop
to
hear
but
offering
my
hand
to
hawley
informed
him
of
my
intention
to
depart
old
chap
he
said
affectionately
glad
you
came
always
a
pleasure
to
see
you
and
i
hope
we
may
meet
again
some
time
soon
and
then
catching
sight
of
my
bundle
he
asked
have
you
there
i
informed
him
of
the
episode
in
the
and
fancied
i
perceived
a
look
of
annoyance
on
his
countenance
did
want
to
take
them
hawley
i
said
ferdinand
insisted
it
all
right
returned
hawley
i
sorry
you
better
get
along
home
with
them
as
quickly
as
you
can
and
say
nothing
and
above
all
do
try
to
sell
them
why
i
asked
much
prefer
to
leave
them
here
if
there
is
any
question
of
the
propriety
of
my
here
continued
hawley
seemed
to
grow
impatient
for
he
stamped
his
foot
angrily
and
bade
me
go
at
once
or
there
might
be
trouble
i
proceeded
to
obey
him
and
left
the
house
instanter
slamming
the
door
somewhat
angrily
behind
me
hawley
unceremonious
way
of
speeding
his
parting
guest
did
not
seem
to
me
to
be
exactly
what
i
had
a
right
to
expect
at
the
time
i
see
now
what
his
object
was
and
acquit
him
of
any
intention
to
be
rude
though
i
must
say
if
i
ever
catch
him
again
wring
an
explanation
from
him
for
having
introduced
me
into
such
bad
company
as
i
walked
down
the
steps
said
the
chimes
of
the
neighboring
church
were
clanging
out
the
hour
of
eleven
i
stopped
on
the
last
step
to
look
for
a
possible
when
a
portly
gentleman
accompanied
by
a
lady
started
to
mount
the
stoop
the
man
eyed
me
narrowly
for
a
moment
and
then
sending
the
lady
up
the
steps
he
turned
to
me
and
said
are
you
doing
here
just
left
the
club
i
answered
all
right
i
was
hawley
hicks
guest
whose
ghost
are
you
the
deuce
are
you
talking
about
he
asked
rather
gruffly
much
to
my
surprise
and
discomfort
tried
to
give
you
a
civil
answer
to
your
question
i
returned
indignantly
guess
you
crazy
or
a
thief
he
rejoined
here
friend
i
put
in
rather
impressively
remember
one
thing
you
are
talking
to
a
gentleman
and
i
do
take
remarks
of
that
sort
from
anybody
spook
or
otherwise
i
do
care
if
you
are
the
ghost
of
the
emperor
nero
if
you
give
me
any
more
of
your
impudence
dissipate
you
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
universe
see
then
he
grabbed
me
and
shouted
for
the
police
and
i
was
painfully
surprised
to
find
that
instead
of
coping
with
a
mysterious
being
from
another
world
i
had
two
hundred
and
ten
pounds
of
flesh
and
blood
to
handle
the
populace
began
to
gather
the
million
and
a
half
of
small
boys
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
mostly
street
gamins
owing
to
the
lateness
of
the
hour
sprang
up
from
all
about
us
drivers
attracted
by
the
noise
of
our
altercation
drew
up
to
the
sidewalk
to
watch
developments
and
then
after
the
usual
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
the
emissary
of
justice
appeared
dthis
he
asked
have
detected
this
man
leaving
my
house
in
a
suspicious
manner
said
my
adversary
have
reason
to
suspect
him
of
thieving
house
i
ejaculated
with
fine
scorn
got
you
there
this
is
the
house
of
the
new
york
branch
of
the
ghost
club
if
you
want
it
proved
i
added
turning
to
the
policeman
the
bell
and
ask
dthat
a
fair
prophosition
observed
the
policeman
the
motion
siconded
come
now
cried
my
captor
this
nonsense
or
i
report
you
to
the
department
this
is
my
house
and
has
been
for
twenty
years
i

if

i
replied
course
i
go
i
have
nothing
to

you
see
added
to
me
in
parenthesis
the
thought
suddenly
flashed
across
my
mind
that
if
all
was
as
my
captor
said
if
the
house
was
really
his
and
not
the
ghost
club
and
if
the
whole
thing
was
only
my
fancy
the
spoons
themselves
would
turn
out
to
be
entirely
fanciful
so
i
was
all
right
or
at
least
i
thought
i
was
so
we
trotted
along
to
the
police
station
on
the
way
i
told
the
policeman
the
whole
story
which
impressed
him
so
that
he
crossed
himself
a
times
and
uttered
numerous
ejaculatory
prayers
dthe
shaints

others
of

he
said
his
voice
trembling
with
emotion
and
then
he
whispered
in
my
ear
belave

to
be

but
av
yez
ai
for
the
love
of
dan
oi

yez
illustration
old
fellow
i
replied
i
am
innocent
of
as
i
can
prove
alas
sighed
the
convict
it
was
not
to
be
so
when
i
arrived
at
the
i
was
dumfounded
to
learn
that
the
spoons
were
all
too
real
i
told
my
story
to
the
sergeant
and
pointed
to
the
monogram
on
the
spoons
as
evidence
that
my
story
was
correct
but
even
that
told
against
me
for
the
alleged
owner
initials
were
his
name
i
withhold
and
the
monogram
only
served
to
substantiate
his
claim
to
the
spoons
worst
of
all
he
claimed
that
he
had
been
robbed
on
several
occasions
before
this
and
by
midnight
i
found
myself
locked
up
in
a
dirty
cell
to
await
trial
i
got
a
lawyer
and
as
i
said
before
even
he
declined
to
believe
my
story
and
suggested
the
insanity
dodge
of
course
i
would
agree
to
that
i
tried
to
get
him
to
subpoena
ferdinand
and
isabella
and
euripides
and
hawley
hicks
in
my
behalf
and
all
he
do
was
to
sit
there
and
shake
his
head
at
me
then
i
suggested
going
up
to
the
metropolitan
some
fearful
night
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
and
try
to
serve
papers
on
wagner
spook
all
of
which
he
treated
as
unworthy
of
a
consideration
then
i
was
tried
convicted
and
sentenced
to
live
in
this
beastly
hole
but
i
have
one
strong
hope
to
buoy
me
up
and
if
that
is
realized
i
be
free
morning
what
is
that
i
asked
why
he
answered
with
a
sigh
as
the
bell
rang
summoning
him
to
his
supper
why
the
whole
horrid
business
has
been
so
weird
and
uncanny
that
i
beginning
to
believe
it
all
a
dream
if
it
is
why
i
wake
up
and
find
myself
at
home
in
bed
that
all
i
clung
to
that
hope
for
nearly
a
year
now
but
it
getting
weaker
every
minute
yes
i
answered
rising
and
shaking
him
by
the
hand
in
parting
that
a
mighty
forlorn
hope
because
i
pretty
wide
awake
myself
at
this
moment
and
ca
be
a
part
of
your
dream
the
great
pity
is
you
did
try
the
insanity
dodge
tut
he
answered
that
is
the
last
resource
of
a
weak
mind
a
psychical
prank
i
willis
had
met
miss
hollister
but
once
and
that
for
a
certain
purpose
was
sufficient
he
was
smitten
she
represented
in
every
way
his
ideal
although
until
he
had
met
her
his
ideal
had
been
something
radically
different
she
was
not
at
all
junoesque
and
the
maiden
of
his
dreams
had
been
decidedly
so
she
had
auburn
hair
which
hitherto
willis
had
detested
indeed
if
the
same
hirsute
wealth
had
adorned
some
other
woman
head
willis
would
have
called
it
red
this
shows
how
completely
he
was
smitten
she
changed
his
point
of
view
entirely
she
shattered
his
old
ideal
and
set
herself
up
in
its
stead
and
she
did
most
of
it
with
a
smile
there
was
something
however
about
miss
hollister
eyes
that
contributed
to
the
smiting
of
willis
heart
they
were
great
round
lustrous
orbs
and
deep
so
deep
were
they
and
so
penetrating
that
willis
affections
were
away
beyond
their
own
depth
the
moment
miss
hollister
eyes
looked
into
his
and
at
the
same
time
he
had
a
dim
and
slightly
uncomfortable
notion
that
she
could
read
every
thought
his
mind
held
within
its
folds
or
rather
that
she
could
see
how
utterly
devoid
of
thought
that
mind
was
upon
this
ecstatic
occasion
for
willis
brain
was
set
all
agog
by
the
sensations
of
the
moment
by
jove
he
said
to
himself
afterwards
for
willis
wise
man
that
he
could
be
on
occasions
was
his
own
confidant
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
by
jove
i
believe
she
can
peer
into
my
very
soul
and
if
she
can
my
hopes
are
blasted
for
she
must
be
able
to
see
that
a
soul
like
mine
is
no
more
worthy
to
become
the
affinity
of
one
like
hers
than
a
mountain
rill
can
hope
to
rival
the
amazon
nevertheless
willis
did
hope
something
may
turn
up
and
perhaps
perhaps
i
can
devise
some
scheme
by
means
of
which
my
imperfections
can
be
hidden
from
her
maybe
i
can
put
stained
glass
over
the
windows
of
my
soul
and
keep
her
from
looking
through
them
at
my
shortcomings
smoked
glasses
perhaps
and
why
not
if
smoked
glasses
can
be
used
by
mortals
gazing
at
the
sun
why
may
they
not
be
used
by
me
when
gazing
into
those
scarcely
less
glorious
orbs
of
hers
alas
for
willis
the
fates
were
against
him
a
tribe
of
fates
were
in
league
to
blast
his
chances
of
success
forever
and
this
was
how
it
happened
willis
had
occasion
one
afternoon
to
come
up
town
early
at
the
corner
of
broadway
and
astor
place
he
entered
a
madison
avenue
car
paid
his
fare
and
sat
down
in
one
of
the
corner
seats
at
the
rear
end
of
the
car
his
mind
was
as
usual
intent
upon
the
glorious
miss
hollister
surely
no
one
who
had
once
met
her
could
do
otherwise
than
think
of
her
constantly
he
reflected
and
the
reflection
made
him
a
bit
jealous
what
business
had
others
to
think
of
her
impertinent
grovelling
mortals
no
man
was
good
enough
to
do
that
no
not
even
himself
but
he
could
change
he
could
at
least
try
to
be
worthy
of
thinking
about
her
and
he
knew
of
no
other
man
who
could
he
like
to
catch
any
one
else
doing
so
little
as
mentioning
her
name
impertinent
grovelling
mortals
he
repeated
and
then
the
car
stopped
at
seventeenth
street
and
who
should
step
on
board
but
miss
hollister
herself
the
idea
thought
willis
by
jove
there
she
is
on
a
too
how
atrocious
one
might
as
well
expect
to
see
minerva
driving
in
a
grocer
wagon
as
miss
hollister
in
a
miserable
untactful
world
to
compel
minerva
to
ride
in
a
or
rather
miss
hollister
to
ride
in
a
grocer
car
absurdest
of
absurdities
here
he
raised
his
hat
for
miss
hollister
had
bowed
sweetly
to
him
as
she
passed
on
to
the
far
end
of
the
car
where
she
stood
hanging
on
to
a
strap
i
wonder
why
she
does
sit
down
thought
willis
for
as
he
looked
about
the
car
he
observed
that
with
the
exception
of
the
one
he
occupied
all
the
seats
were
vacant
in
fact
the
only
persons
on
board
were
miss
hollister
the
driver
the
conductor
and
himself
i
think
i
go
speak
to
her
he
thought
and
then
he
thought
again
no
i
better
not
she
saw
me
when
she
entered
and
if
she
had
wished
to
speak
to
me
she
would
have
sat
down
here
beside
me
or
opposite
me
perhaps
i
shall
show
myself
worthy
of
her
by
not
thrusting
my
presence
upon
her
but
i
wonder
why
she
stands
she
looks
tired
enough
here
miss
hollister
indulged
in
a
very
singular
performance
she
bowed
her
head
slightly
at
some
one
apparently
on
the
sidewalk
willis
thought
murmured
something
the
purport
of
which
willis
could
not
catch
and
sat
down
in
the
middle
of
the
seat
on
the
other
side
of
the
car
looking
very
much
annoyed
in
fact
almost
unamiable
willis
was
more
mystified
than
ever
but
his
mystification
was
as
nothing
compared
to
his
anxiety
when
on
reaching
street
miss
hollister
rose
and
sweeping
by
him
without
a
sign
of
recognition
left
the
car
cut
by
thunder
ejaculated
willis
in
consternation
and
why
i
wonder
most
incomprehensible
affair
can
she
be
a
woman
of
whims
with
eyes
like
those
never
impossible
and
yet
what
else
can
be
the
matter
try
as
he
might
willis
could
not
solve
the
problem
it
was
utterly
past
solution
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
i
find
out
and
i
find
out
like
a
brave
man
he
said
after
racking
his
brains
for
an
hour
or
two
in
a
vain
endeavor
to
get
at
the
cause
of
miss
hollister
cut
i
call
upon
her
and
ask
her
he
was
true
to
his
first
purpose
but
not
to
his
second
he
called
but
he
did
not
ask
her
for
miss
hollister
did
not
give
him
the
chance
to
do
so
upon
receiving
his
card
she
sent
down
word
that
she
was
out
two
days
later
meeting
him
face
to
face
upon
the
street
she
gazed
coldly
at
him
and
cut
him
once
more
six
months
later
her
engagement
to
a
boston
man
was
announced
and
in
the
autumn
following
miss
hollister
of
new
york
became
barrows
of
boston
there
were
cards
but
willis
did
not
receive
one
of
them
the
cut
was
indeed
complete
and
final
but
why
that
had
now
become
one
of
the
great
problems
of
willis
life
what
had
he
done
to
be
so
badly
treated
ii
a
year
passed
by
and
willis
recovered
from
the
dreadful
blow
to
his
hopes
but
he
often
puzzled
over
miss
hollister
singular
behavior
towards
him
he
had
placed
the
matter
before
several
of
his
friends
and
with
the
exception
of
one
of
them
none
was
more
capable
of
solving
his
problem
than
he
this
one
had
heard
from
his
wife
a
school
friend
and
intimate
acquaintance
of
miss
hollister
now
barrows
that
ideal
had
once
expressed
herself
to
the
effect
that
she
had
admired
willis
very
much
until
she
had
discovered
that
he
was
not
always
as
courteous
as
he
should
be
courteous
not
as
courteous
as
i
should
be
retorted
willis
when
have
i
ever
been
anything
else
why
my
dear
bronson
he
added
you
know
what
my
attitude
towards
womankind
as
well
as
mankind
has
always
been
if
there
is
a
creature
in
the
world
whose
politeness
is
his
weakness
i
am
that
creature
i
the
most
courteous
man
living
when
i
play
poker
in
my
own
rooms
i
lose
money
because
i
made
it
a
rule
never
to
beat
my
guests
in
cards
or
anything
else
that
is
politeness
said
bronson
that
idiocy
it
proves
my
point
retorted
willis
i
polite
to
the
verge
of
insanity
not
as
courteous
as
i
should
be
great
scott
what
did
i
ever
do
or
say
to
give
her
that
idea
i
do
know
bronson
replied
better
ask
her
maybe
you
overdid
your
politeness
overdone
courtesy
is
often
worse
than
boorishness
you
may
have
been
so
polite
on
some
occasion
that
you
made
miss
hollister
think
you
considered
her
an
inferior
person
you
know
what
the
poet
insinuated
sorosis
holds
no
fury
like
a
woman
condescended
to
by
a
man
i
half
a
mind
to
write
to
barrows
and
ask
her
what
i
did
said
willis
that
would
be
lovely
said
bronson
barrows
would
be
pleased
true
i
never
thought
of
that
replied
willis
you
are
not
a
thoughtful
thinker
said
bronson
dryly
if
i
were
you
i
bide
my
time
and
some
day
you
may
get
an
explanation
stranger
things
have
happened
and
my
wife
tells
me
that
the
barrowses
are
to
spend
the
coming
winter
in
new
york
you
meet
them
out
somewhere
no
doubt
no
i
shall
decline
to
go
where
they
are
no
woman
shall
cut
me
a
second
time
not
even
barrows
said
willis
firmly
good
stand
by
your
colors
said
bronson
with
an
amused
smile
a
week
or
two
later
willis
received
an
invitation
from
and
bronson
to
dine
with
them
informally
i
have
some
very
clever
friends
i
want
you
to
meet
she
wrote
so
be
sure
to
come
willis
went
the
clever
friends
were
and
barrows
and
to
the
surprise
of
willis
he
was
received
most
effusively
by
the
quondam
miss
hollister
why
willis
she
said
extending
her
hand
to
him
how
delightful
to
see
you
again
thank
you
said
willis
in
some
confusion
i
er
i
am
sure
it
is
a
very
pleasant
surprise
for
me
i
er
had
no
idea
nor
i
returned
barrows
and
really
i
should
have
been
a
little
embarrassed
i
think
had
i
known
you
were
to
be
here
i
ha
ha
it
so
very
absurd
that
i
almost
hesitate
to
speak
of
it
but
i
feel
i
must
treated
you
very
badly
indeed
said
willis
with
a
smile
how
pray
well
it
was
my
fault
really
returned
barrows
but
do
you
remember
a
little
over
a
year
ago
my
riding
on
a
a
madison
avenue
car
with
you
h
said
willis
with
an
affectation
of
reflection
let
me
see
ah
yes
i
think
i
do
we
were
the
only
ones
on
board
i
believe
and
ah
here
barrows
laughed
outright
you
thought
we
were
the
only
ones
on
board
but
we
were
the
car
was
crowded
she
said
then
i
do
remember
it
said
willis
the
only
time
i
ever
rode
on
a
with
you
to
my
knowledge
was
i
know
this
was
the
occasion
interrupted
barrows
you
sat
in
a
corner
at
the
rear
end
of
the
car
when
i
entered
and
i
was
very
much
put
out
with
you
because
it
remained
for
a
stranger
whom
i
had
often
seen
and
to
whom
i
had
for
reasons
unknown
even
to
myself
taken
a
deep
aversion
to
offer
me
his
seat
and
what
is
more
compel
me
to
take
it
i
do
understand
said
willis
we
were
alone
on
the
car
to
your
eyes
we
were
although
at
the
time
i
did
not
know
it
to
my
eyes
when
i
boarded
it
the
car
was
occupied
by
enough
people
to
fill
all
the
seats
you
returned
my
bow
as
i
entered
but
did
not
offer
me
your
seat
the
stranger
did
and
while
i
tried
to
decline
it
i
was
unable
to
do
so
he
was
a
man
of
about
my
own
age
and
he
had
a
most
remarkable
pair
of
eyes
there
was
no
resisting
them
his
offer
was
a
command
and
as
i
rode
along
and
thought
of
your
sitting
motionless
at
the
end
of
the
car
compelling
me
to
stand
and
being
indirectly
responsible
for
my
acceptance
of
courtesies
from
a
total
and
disagreeable
stranger
i
became
so
very
indignant
with
you
that
i
passed
you
without
recognition
as
soon
as
i
could
summon
up
courage
to
leave
i
could
not
understand
why
you
who
had
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
soul
of
politeness
should
upon
this
occasion
have
failed
to
do
not
what
i
should
exact
from
any
man
but
what
i
had
reason
to
expect
of
you
but
barrows
remonstrated
willis
why
should
i
give
up
a
seat
to
a
lady
when
there
were
twenty
other
seats
unoccupied
on
the
same
car
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
why
you
should
replied
barrows
but
it
was
not
until
last
winter
that
i
discovered
the
trick
that
had
been
put
upon
us
ah
said
willis
trick
yes
said
barrows
it
was
a
trick
the
car
was
empty
to
your
eyes
but
crowded
to
mine
with
the
astral
bodies
of
the
members
of
the
boston
theosophical
society
roared
willis
it
is
just
as
i
have
said
replied
barrows
with
a
silvery
laugh
they
are
all
great
friends
of
my
husband
and
one
night
last
winter
he
dined
them
at
our
house
and
who
do
you
suppose
walked
in
first
madame
blavatsky
ghost
suggested
willis
with
a
grin
not
quite
returned
barrows
but
the
horrible
stranger
of
the
and
do
you
know
he
recalled
the
whole
thing
to
my
mind
assuring
me
that
he
and
the
others
had
projected
their
astral
bodies
over
to
new
york
for
a
week
and
had
a
magnificent
time
unperceived
by
all
save
myself
who
was
unconsciously
psychic
and
so
able
to
perceive
them
in
their
invisible
forms
it
was
a
mean
trick
on
me
barrows
said
willis
ruefully
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
sufficiently
from
his
surprise
to
speak
oh
no
she
replied
with
a
repetition
of
her
charming
laugh
which
rearoused
in
willis
breast
all
the
regrets
of
a
lost
cause
they
intend
it
especially
for
you
anyhow
well
said
willis
i
think
they
did
they
were
friends
of
your
husband
and
they
wanted
to
ruin
me
ruin
you
and
why
should
the
friends
of
barrows
have
wished
to
do
that
asked
barrows
in
astonishment
because
began
willis
slowly
and
softly
because
they
probably
knew
that
from
the
moment
i
met
you
i
but
that
is
a
story
with
a
disagreeable
climax
barrows
so
i
shall
not
tell
it
how
do
you
like
boston
the
literary
remains
of
thomas
bragdon
i
was
much
pained
one
morning
last
winter
on
picking
up
a
copy
of
the
to
note
therein
the
announcement
of
the
death
of
my
friend
tom
bragdon
from
a
sudden
attack
of
la
grippe
the
news
stunned
me
it
was
like
a
clap
of
thunder
out
of
a
clear
sky
for
i
had
not
even
heard
that
tom
was
ill
indeed
we
had
parted
not
more
than
four
days
previously
after
a
luncheon
together
at
which
it
was
i
who
was
the
object
of
his
sympathy
because
a
severe
cold
prevented
my
enjoyment
of
the
whitebait
the
fillet
the
cigar
and
indeed
of
everything
not
even
excepting
bragdon
conversation
which
upon
that
occasion
should
have
seemed
more
than
usually
enlivening
since
he
was
in
one
of
his
most
exuberant
moods
his
last
words
to
me
were
take
care
of
yourself
phil
i
should
hate
to
have
you
die
for
force
of
habit
is
so
strong
with
me
that
i
shall
forever
continue
to
lunch
with
none
but
you
ordering
two
portions
of
everything
which
i
am
sure
i
could
not
eat
and
how
wasteful
that
would
be
and
now
he
had
passed
over
the
threshold
into
the
valley
and
i
was
left
to
mourn
i
had
known
bragdon
as
a
successful
commission
merchant
for
some
ten
or
fifteen
years
during
which
period
of
time
we
had
been
more
or
less
intimate
particularly
so
in
the
last
five
years
of
his
life
when
we
were
drawn
more
closely
together
i
attracted
by
the
absolute
genuineness
of
his
character
his
delightful
fancy
and
to
my
mind
wonderful
originality
for
i
never
knew
another
like
him
he
possibly
by
the
fact
that
i
was
one
of
the
very
few
who
could
entirely
understand
him
could
sympathize
with
his
peculiarities
which
were
many
and
was
always
ready
to
enter
into
any
one
of
his
odd
moods
and
with
quite
as
much
spirit
as
he
himself
should
display
it
was
an
ideal
friendship
illustration
it
had
been
our
custom
every
summer
to
take
what
bragdon
called
spirit
trips
together
that
is
to
say
generally
in
the
early
spring
bragdon
and
i
would
choose
some
corner
of
the
world
for
exploration
we
would
each
read
all
the
literature
that
we
could
find
concerning
the
chosen
locality
saturate
our
minds
with
the
spirit
atmosphere
and
history
of
the
place
and
then
in
august
boarding
a
small
boat
belonging
to
bragdon
we
would
cruise
about
the
long
island
sound
or
sail
up
and
down
the
hudson
river
for
a
week
where
tabooing
all
other
subjects
we
would
tell
each
other
all
that
we
had
been
able
to
discover
concerning
the
place
we
had
decided
upon
for
our
imaginary
visit
in
this
way
we
became
tolerably
familiar
with
several
places
of
interest
which
neither
of
us
had
ever
visited
and
which
in
my
case
financial
limitations
and
in
bragdon
lack
of
time
were
likely
always
to
prevent
our
seeing
as
i
remember
the
matter
this
plan
was
bragdon
own
and
its
first
suggestion
by
him
was
received
by
me
with
a
smile
of
derision
but
the
quaintness
of
the
idea
in
time
won
me
over
and
after
the
first
trial
when
we
made
a
spirit
trip
to
beloochistan
i
was
so
fascinated
by
my
experience
that
i
eagerly
looked
forward
to
a
second
in
the
series
and
was
always
thereafter
only
too
glad
to
bear
my
share
of
the
trouble
and
expense
of
our
annual
journeyings
in
this
manner
we
had
practically
circumnavigated
this
world
and
one
or
two
of
the
planets
for
content
as
we
were
to
visit
unseen
countries
in
spirit
only
we
were
never
hampered
by
the
ordinary
limitations
of
travel
and
where
books
failed
to
supply
us
with
information
the
imagination
was
called
into
play
the
universe
was
open
to
us
at
the
expense
of
a
captain
for
our
sharpie
canned
provisions
for
a
week
and
a
moderate
consumption
of
gray
matter
in
the
conjuring
up
of
scenes
with
which
neither
ourselves
nor
others
were
familiar
the
trips
were
refreshing
always
and
in
the
case
of
our
spirit
journey
through
italy
which
at
that
time
neither
of
us
had
visited
but
which
i
have
since
had
the
to
see
in
the
fulness
of
her
beauty
i
found
it
to
be
far
more
delightful
than
the
reality
illustration
we
go
in
said
bragdon
when
he
proposed
the
italian
tour
by
the
gothard
route
the
description
of
which
i
will
prepare
in
detail
myself
you
can
take
the
lakes
rounding
up
with
como
i
will
follow
with
the
trip
from
como
to
milan
and
milan
shall
be
my
care
you
can
do
verona
and
padua
i
venice
then
we
can
both
try
our
hands
at
rome
and
naples
in
the
latter
place
to
save
time
i
will
take
pompeii
you
capri
thence
we
can
hark
back
to
rome
thence
to
pisa
genoa
and
turin
giving
a
day
to
siena
and
some
of
the
quaint
etruscan
towns
passing
out
by
the
mont
cenis
route
from
turin
to
geneva
if
you
choose
you
can
take
a
run
along
the
riviera
and
visit
monte
carlo
for
my
own
part
though
i
prefer
not
to
do
that
because
it
brings
a
sensational
element
into
the
trip
which
i
do
particularly
care
for
you
have
to
gamble
and
if
your
imagination
is
to
have
full
play
you
ought
to
lose
all
your
money
contemplate
suicide
and
all
that
i
do
think
the
results
would
be
worth
the
mental
strain
you
have
to
go
through
and
i
certainly
should
not
enjoy
hearing
about
it
the
rest
of
the
trip
though
we
can
do
easily
in
five
days
which
will
leave
us
two
for
fishing
if
we
feel
so
disposed
they
say
the
are
biting
like
the
devil
this
year
i
regret
now
that
we
did
not
include
a
stenographer
among
the
necessaries
of
our
spirit
trips
for
as
i
look
back
upon
that
italian
tour
it
was
well
worthy
of
preservation
in
book
form
particularly
contributions
which
were
so
delightfully
imaginative
that
i
can
not
but
rejoice
that
he
did
not
live
to
visit
the
scenes
of
which
he
so
eloquently
spoke
to
me
upon
that
occasion
the
reality
i
fear
would
have
been
a
sore
disappointment
to
him
particularly
in
relation
to
venice
concerning
which
his
notions
were
vaguely
suggestive
of
an
earthly
floating
paradise
illustration
ah
philip
he
said
as
we
cast
anchor
one
night
in
a
little
inlet
near
milford
connecticut
i
shall
never
forget
venice
this
he
added
waving
his
hand
over
the
silvery
surface
of
the
moonlit
water
this
reminds
me
of
it
all
is
so
still
so
romantic
so
beautiful
i
arrived
late
at
night
and
my
first
sensations
were
those
of
a
man
who
has
entered
a
city
of
the
dead
the
bustle
the
noise
and
clatter
of
a
great
city
were
absent
nothing
was
there
but
the
massive
buildings
rising
up
out
of
the
still
peaceful
waters
like
gigantic
tombs
and
as
my
gondolier
guided
the
sombre
black
craft
to
which
i
had
confided
my
safety
and
that
of
my
valise
gliding
in
and
out
along
those
dark
unlit
streams
a
great
wave
of
melancholy
swept
over
me
and
then
passing
from
the
minor
streets
into
the
grand
canal
the
melancholy
was
dispelled
by
the
brilliant
scene
that
met
my
eyes
great
floods
of
light
coming
from
everywhere
the
brilliance
of
each
ray
by
its
reflection
in
the
silent
river
over
which
i
was
speeding
it
was
like
a
glimpse
of
paradise
and
when
i
reached
my
palace
i
was
loath
to
leave
the
gondola
for
i
really
felt
as
though
i
could
glide
along
in
that
way
through
all
eternity
you
lived
in
a
palace
in
venice
i
asked
somewhat
amused
at
the
magnificence
of
this
imaginary
tour
certainly
why
not
he
replied
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
staying
in
a
hotel
phil
in
venice
venice
is
of
a
past
age
when
hotels
were
not
and
to
be
thoroughly
with
my
surroundings
i
took
up
my
abode
in
a
palace
as
i
have
said
it
was
on
one
of
the
side
streets
to
be
sure
but
it
was
yet
a
palace
and
a
beautiful
one
and
that
street
it
was
a
rivulet
of
beauty
in
which
could
be
seen
myriads
of
fish
at
play
which
as
the
gondola
passed
to
and
fro
would
flirt
into
hiding
until
the
intruder
had
passed
out
of
sight
in
the
grand
canal
after
which
they
would
come
slowly
back
again
to
render
the
silver
waters
almost
golden
with
their
brilliance
were
you
rather
extravagant
tom
i
asked
palaces
are
costly
are
they
not
oh
no
he
replied
with
as
much
gravity
as
though
he
had
really
taken
the
trip
and
was
imparting
information
to
a
seeker
after
knowledge
it
was
not
extravagant
when
you
consider
that
anything
in
venice
in
the
way
of
a
habitable
house
is
called
a
palace
and
that
there
are
no
servants
to
be
tipped
that
your
lights
candles
all
cost
you
first
price
only
and
not
the
profit
of
the
landlord
plus
that
of
the
concierge
plus
that
of
the
maid
plus
several
other
small
but
aggravatingly
augmentative
sums
which
make
your
hotel
bills
seem
like
highway
robbery
no
living
in
a
palace
on
the
whole
is
cheaper
than
living
in
a
hotel
incidentals
are
less
numerous
and
not
so
costly
and
then
you
are
so
independent
mine
was
a
particularly
handsome
structure
i
believe
i
have
a
picture
of
it
here
here
bragdon
fumbled
in
his
satchel
for
a
moment
and
then
dragged
forth
a
small
unmounted
photograph
of
a
venetian
street
scene
and
pointing
out
an
ornate
structure
at
the
left
of
the
picture
assured
me
that
that
was
his
palace
though
he
had
forgotten
the
name
of
it
he
said
let
me
say
parenthetically
that
i
think
our
foreign
trips
will
have
a
far
greater
if
we
heighten
the
illusion
with
a
few
photographs
do
you
they
cost
about
a
quarter
apiece
at
blank
in
street
a
good
idea
that
i
answered
amused
at
the
thoroughness
with
which
bragdon
was
doing
venice
we
can
remember
what
we
have
seen
so
very
much
more
easily
yes
bragdon
said
and
besides
they
keep
us
from
exaggeration
and
then
he
went
on
to
tell
me
of
his
month
in
venice
how
he
chartered
a
gondola
for
the
whole
of
his
stay
there
from
a
handsome
romantic
venetian
youth
whose
name
was
on
a
card
tom
had
had
printed
for
the
occasion
reading
giuseppe
zocco
gondolas
at
all
hours
cor
grand
canal
and
garibaldi
giuseppe
was
a
character
bragdon
said
one
of
the
remnants
of
a
age
he
could
sing
like
a
bird
and
at
night
he
used
to
bring
his
friends
around
to
the
front
of
my
palace
and
hitch
up
to
one
of
the
piles
that
were
driven
beside
my
doorstep
and
there
they
sing
their
soft
italian
melodies
for
me
by
the
hour
it
was
better
than
italian
opera
and
only
cost
me
ten
dollars
for
the
whole
season
and
did
this
giuseppe
speak
english
tom
i
queried
or
did
you
speak
italian
i
am
curious
to
know
how
you
got
on
together
in
a
conversational
sense
illustration
that
is
a
point
my
dear
phil
bragdon
replied
that
i
have
never
decided
i
have
looked
at
it
from
every
point
of
view
and
it
has
baffled
me
i
have
asked
myself
the
question
which
would
be
the
more
likely
that
giuseppe
should
speak
english
or
that
i
should
speak
italian
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
the
latter
would
be
the
better
way
for
all
things
considered
an
american
is
more
likely
to
be
familiar
with
the
italian
tongue
than
a
venetian
with
the
english
on
the
other
hand
we
want
our
accounts
of
these
trips
to
seem
truthful
and
you
that
i
am
not
familiar
with
italian
and
we
do
not
either
of
us
know
that
a
possible
zocco
would
not
be
a
fluent
speaker
of
english
to
be
honest
with
you
i
will
say
that
i
had
hoped
you
would
not
ask
the
question
well
i
answered
i
withdraw
it
as
this
is
only
a
spirit
trip
we
can
each
decide
the
point
as
it
seems
best
to
us
i
think
that
is
the
proper
plan
he
said
and
then
proceeding
with
his
story
he
described
to
me
the
marvellous
paintings
that
adorned
the
walls
of
his
palace
how
he
had
tried
to
propel
a
gondola
himself
and
got
a
fall
into
the
deliciously
tepid
waters
of
the
canal
as
he
called
them
for
his
pains
and
it
seemed
very
real
so
minute
were
the
details
into
which
he
entered
but
the
height
of
bragdon
realism
in
telling
his
story
of
venice
was
reached
when
diving
down
into
the
innermost
recesses
of
his
vest
pocket
he
brought
forth
a
silver
filigree
effigy
of
a
gondola
which
he
handed
me
with
the
statement
that
it
was
for
me
i
got
that
in
the
plaza
of
marc
i
had
visited
the
cathedral
inspected
the
mosaic
flooring
taken
a
run
to
the
top
of
the
campanile
fed
the
pigeons
and
was
just
about
returning
to
the
palace
when
i
thought
of
you
phil
getting
ready
to
do
rome
with
me
and
i
thought
to
myself
a
dear
fellow
he
is
and
as
i
thought
that
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
like
you
to
know
i
had
you
in
mind
at
the
time
and
so
i
stopped
in
one
of
those
brilliant
little
shops
on
the
plaza
where
they
keep
everything
they
have
in
the
windows
and
bought
that
it
is
much
old
fellow
but
it
for
remembrance
sake
i
took
it
from
him
and
pressed
his
hand
affectionately
and
for
a
moment
as
the
little
sharpie
rose
and
fell
with
the
rising
and
falling
of
the
slight
undulating
waves
made
by
the
passing
up
to
anchorage
of
a
small
i
almost
believed
that
tom
had
been
to
venice
i
still
treasure
the
little
filigree
gondola
nor
did
i
when
some
years
later
i
visited
venice
see
there
anything
for
which
i
would
have
exchanged
that
sweet
token
of
remembrance
bragdon
as
will
already
have
been
surmised
by
you
who
read
was
more
of
a
humorist
than
anything
else
but
the
enthusiasm
of
his
humor
its
absolute
spontaneity
and
kindliness
gave
it
at
times
a
semblance
to
what
might
pass
for
true
poetry
he
was
by
disposition
a
thoroughly
sweet
spirit
and
when
i
realized
that
he
had
gone
before
and
that
the
trips
he
and
i
had
looked
forward
to
with
such
almost
boyish
delight
year
by
year
were
never
more
to
be
had
my
eyes
grew
wet
and
for
a
time
i
was
disconsolate
and
yet
one
week
later
i
was
laughing
heartily
at
bragdon
he
had
appointed
me
it
was
found
when
his
will
was
read
his
literary
executor
i
fairly
roared
with
mirth
to
think
of
bragdon
having
a
literary
executor
for
imaginative
and
humorous
as
he
undoubtedly
was
he
had
been
so
thoroughly
identified
in
my
mind
with
the
produce
business
that
i
could
scarcely
bring
myself
to
think
of
him
in
the
light
of
a
literary
person
indeed
he
had
always
seemed
to
me
to
have
an
intolerance
of
literature
i
had
taken
but
half
of
a
spirit
trip
with
him
when
i
discovered
that
he
relied
more
upon
his
own
imagination
for
facts
of
interest
than
upon
what
could
be
derived
from
books
he
showed
this
trait
no
more
strongly
than
when
we
came
upon
this
same
italian
tour
of
which
i
have
already
written
at
some
length
to
do
rome
together
for
i
then
discovered
how
imaginary
indeed
the
trips
were
from
his
point
of
view
what
seemed
to
him
as
proper
to
be
was
and
neither
history
nor
considerations
of
locality
ever
interfered
with
the
things
being
as
he
desired
them
to
be
had
it
been
otherwise
he
never
would
have
endeavored
to
make
me
believe
that
he
had
stood
upon
the
very
spot
in
the
colosseum
where
caesar
addressed
the
roman
mob
in
impassioned
words
exhorting
them
to
resist
the
encroachment
upon
their
liberties
of
the
pope
at
first
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
late
friend
was
indulging
in
a
posthumous
joke
and
i
paid
his
memory
the
compliment
of
seeing
the
point
but
when
some
days
later
i
received
a
note
from
his
executors
stating
that
they
had
found
in
the
of
bragdon
house
a
large
full
of
papers
and
books
upon
the
cover
of
which
was
tacked
a
card
bearing
my
address
i
began
to
wonder
whether
or
not
after
all
the
imagination
of
my
dead
friend
had
really
led
him
to
believe
that
he
possessed
literary
ability
i
immediately
sent
word
to
the
executors
to
have
the
box
forwarded
to
me
by
express
and
awaited
its
coming
with
no
little
interest
and
it
must
be
confessed
with
some
anxiety
for
i
am
apt
to
be
depressed
by
the
literary
lucubrations
of
those
of
my
friends
who
devoid
of
the
literary
quality
do
yet
persist
in
writing
and
for
as
long
a
time
as
i
had
known
bragdon
i
had
never
experienced
through
him
any
sensations
save
those
of
exhilaration
and
i
greatly
feared
a
posthumous
breaking
of
the
spell
poet
in
feeling
as
i
thought
him
i
could
hardly
imagine
a
poem
written
by
my
friend
and
while
i
had
little
doubt
that
i
could
live
through
the
reading
of
a
novel
or
short
prose
sketch
from
his
pen
i
was
apprehensive
as
to
the
effect
of
a
possible
bit
of
verse
it
seemed
to
me
in
short
that
a
poem
by
bragdon
while
it
might
easily
show
the
poet
fancy
could
not
fail
to
show
also
the
clumsiness
of
touch
his
charm
was
the
spontaneity
of
his
spoken
words
his
enthusiastic
personality
disarming
all
criticism
what
the
labored
productions
of
his
fancy
might
prove
to
be
i
hardly
dared
think
it
was
this
dread
that
induced
me
upon
receipt
of
the
box
appalling
in
its
bulk
and
unpleasantly
suggestive
of
the
departure
to
other
worlds
of
the
original
consignor
since
it
was
long
and
deep
like
the
outer
oaken
covering
of
a
casket
to
delay
opening
it
for
some
days
but
finally
i
nerved
myself
up
to
the
duty
that
had
devolved
upon
me
and
opened
the
box
illustration
it
was
full
to
overflowing
with
printed
books
in
fine
bindings
short
tales
in
bragdon
familiar
hand
in
manuscripts
almost
without
number
three
containing
the
told
me
that
which
i
most
dreaded
to
find
poems
of
thomas
and
dedicated
to
his
dearest
friend
myself
i
had
no
heart
to
read
beyond
the
dedication
that
night
but
devoted
all
my
time
to
getting
the
contents
of
the
box
into
my
library
having
done
which
i
felt
it
absolutely
essential
to
my
happiness
to
put
on
my
coat
and
though
the
night
was
stormy
to
rush
out
into
the
air
i
think
i
should
have
suffocated
in
an
open
field
with
those
literary
remains
of
thomas
bragdon
heaped
about
me
that
night
on
my
return
i
went
immediately
to
bed
feeling
by
no
means
in
the
mood
to
read
poems
of
thomas
i
tossed
about
through
the
night
sleeping
little
and
in
the
morning
rose
up
unrefreshed
and
set
about
the
examination
of
the
papers
and
books
intrusted
to
my
care
by
my
departed
friend
and
oh
the
stuff
i
found
there
if
i
was
depressed
at
starting
in
i
was
stupefied
when
it
was
all
over
for
the
collection
was
mystifying
to
the
point
that
it
stunned
in
the
first
place
on
opening
volume
of
the
of
thomas
the
first
thing
to
greet
my
eyes
were
these
lines
constancy
often
have
i
heard
it
said
that
her
lips
are
little
heed
i
what
they
say
i
have
seen
as
red
as
they
ere
she
smiled
on
other
men
real
rubies
were
they
then
but
now
her
lips
are
coy
and
cold
to
mine
they
reply
and
yet
i
cease
not
to
behold
the
in
her
eye
her
very
frowns
are
fairer
far
than
smiles
of
other
maidens
are
as
i
read
i
was
conscious
of
having
seen
the
lines
somewhere
before
and
yet
i
could
not
place
them
for
the
moment
they
certainly
possessed
merit
so
much
so
in
fact
that
i
marvelled
to
think
of
their
being
bragdon
i
turned
the
leaves
further
and
discovered
this
disappointment
come
to
me
o
ye
children
for
i
hear
you
at
your
play
and
the
questions
that
perplexed
me
have
vanished
quite
away
the
poem
of
the
universe
nor
rhythm
has
nor
rhyme
some
god
recites
the
wondrous
song
a
stanza
at
a
time
i
dwell
not
now
on
what
may
be
night
shadows
the
scene
but
still
my
fancy
wanders
free
through
that
which
might
have
been
two
stanzas
in
the
poem
the
first
and
the
last
reminded
me
as
did
the
lines
on
constancy
of
something
i
had
read
before
in
a
moment
i
had
placed
the
first
as
the
opening
lines
of
longfellow
children
and
a
search
through
my
books
showed
that
the
concluding
verse
was
taken
bodily
from
peacock
exquisite
little
poem
castles
in
the
air
despairing
to
solve
the
problem
that
now
confronted
me
which
was
in
brief
what
bragdon
meant
by
bodily
lifting
stanzas
from
the
poets
and
making
them
over
into
mosaics
of
his
own
i
turned
from
the
poems
and
cast
my
eyes
over
some
of
the
bound
volumes
in
the
box
the
first
of
these
to
come
to
hand
was
a
copy
of
bound
in
tree
calf
the
sole
lettering
on
the
book
being
on
the
back
as
follows
hamlet
bragdon
new
york
this
i
deemed
a
harmless
bit
of
vanity
and
not
necessarily
misleading
since
many
collectors
of
books
see
fit
to
have
their
own
names
emblazoned
on
the
backs
of
their
literary
treasures
but
pray
imagine
my
horror
upon
opening
the
volume
to
discover
that
the
name
of
william
shakespeare
had
been
erased
from
the
and
that
of
thomas
bragdon
so
carefully
inserted
that
except
to
a
practised
eye
none
would
ever
know
that
the
page
was
not
as
it
had
always
been
i
must
confess
to
some
mirth
when
i
read
that
hamlet
prince
of
denmark
a
tragedy
by
thomas
bragdon
esquire
the
conceit
was
well
worthy
of
my
late
friend
in
one
of
his
most
fanciful
moods
in
other
volumes
the
same
substitution
had
been
made
so
that
to
one
not
versed
in
literature
it
would
have
seemed
as
though
thomas
bragdon
esquire
had
been
the
author
not
only
of
but
also
of
and
many
other
famous
works
and
i
am
not
sure
but
that
the
great
problem
concerning
the
junius
letters
was
here
solved
to
the
satisfaction
of
bragdon
if
not
to
my
own
there
were
but
two
exceptions
in
the
box
to
the
rule
of
substituting
the
name
of
bragdon
for
that
of
the
actual
author
one
of
these
was
an
old
testament
on
the
of
which
bragdon
had
written
to
my
dear
friend
bragdon
and
signed
the
author
i
think
i
should
have
laughed
for
hours
over
this
delightful
reminder
of
my
late
friend
power
of
imagination
had
not
the
second
exception
come
almost
immediately
to
hand
a
copy
of
milton
which
i
recognized
at
once
as
one
i
had
sent
tom
at
christmas
two
years
before
his
death
and
on
the
of
which
i
had
written
to
thomas
bragdon
with
the
love
of
his
faithfully
philip
marsden
this
was
indeed
a
commonplace
enough
inscription
but
it
gathered
unexpected
force
when
i
turned
over
a
leaf
and
my
eyes
rested
on
the
title
where
bragdon
love
of
substitutes
had
led
him
to
put
my
name
where
milton
had
been
the
discovery
was
too
much
for
my
equanimity
i
was
thoroughly
disconcerted
almost
angry
and
i
felt
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
there
had
been
vagaries
in
bragdon
character
with
which
i
could
not
entirely
sympathize
but
in
justice
to
myself
it
must
be
said
these
sentiments
were
induced
by
first
thoughts
only
certainly
there
could
be
but
one
way
in
which
bragdon
substitution
of
my
name
for
milton
could
prove
injurious
or
offensive
to
me
who
was
his
friend
and
that
was
by
his
putting
that
copy
out
before
the
world
to
be
circulated
at
random
which
avenue
to
my
discomfiture
he
had
effectually
closed
by
leaving
the
book
in
my
hands
to
do
with
it
whatsoever
i
pleased
second
thoughts
showed
me
that
it
was
only
a
fear
of
what
the
outsider
might
think
that
was
responsible
for
my
temporary
disloyalty
to
my
departed
comrade
memory
and
then
when
i
remembered
how
thoroughly
we
twain
had
despised
the
outsider
i
was
so
ashamed
of
my
aberration
that
i
immediately
renewed
my
allegiance
to
the
late
king
tom
so
heartily
in
fact
that
my
emotions
wellnigh
overcame
me
and
i
found
it
best
to
seek
distractions
in
the
outer
world
i
put
on
my
hat
and
took
a
long
walk
along
the
riverside
drive
the
crisp
air
of
the
winter
night
proving
a
tonic
to
my
disturbed
system
it
was
after
midnight
when
i
returned
to
my
apartment
in
a
tolerably
comfortable
frame
of
mind
and
yet
as
i
opened
the
door
to
my
study
i
was
filled
with
a
vague
apprehension
of
what
i
could
not
determine
but
which
events
soon
justified
for
as
i
closed
the
door
behind
me
and
turned
up
the
light
over
my
table
i
became
conscious
of
a
pair
of
eyes
fixed
upon
me
nervously
whirling
about
in
my
chair
and
glancing
over
towards
my
fireplace
i
was
for
a
moment
transfixed
with
terror
for
there
leaning
against
the
mantel
and
gazing
sadly
into
the
fire
was
tom
bragdon
himself
the
man
whom
but
a
short
time
before
i
had
seen
lowered
into
his
grave
illustration
tom
i
cried
springing
to
my
feet
and
rushing
towards
him
tom
what
does
this
mean
why
have
you
come
back
from
the
spirit
world
to
to
haunt
me
as
i
spoke
he
raised
his
head
slowly
until
his
eyes
rested
full
upon
my
own
whereupon
he
vanished
all
save
those
eyes
which
remained
fixed
upon
mine
and
filled
with
the
soft
affectionate
glow
i
had
so
often
seen
in
them
in
life
tom
i
cried
again
holding
out
my
hand
towards
him
in
a
beseeching
fashion
come
back
explain
this
dreadful
mystery
if
you
do
not
wish
me
to
lose
my
senses
and
then
the
eyes
faded
from
my
sight
and
i
was
alone
again
horrified
by
my
experience
i
rushed
from
the
study
into
my
bedroom
where
i
threw
myself
groaning
upon
my
couch
to
collect
my
scattered
senses
was
of
difficult
performance
and
when
finally
my
agitated
nerves
did
begin
to
assume
a
moderately
normal
state
they
were
set
adrift
once
more
by
voice
which
was
unmistakably
plain
bidding
me
to
come
back
to
him
there
in
the
study
fearful
as
i
was
of
the
results
i
could
not
but
obey
and
i
rose
tremblingly
from
my
bed
and
tottered
back
to
my
desk
to
see
bragdon
sitting
opposite
my
usual
place
just
as
he
had
so
often
done
when
in
the
flesh
phil
he
said
in
a
moment
do
be
afraid
i
could
hurt
you
if
i
would
and
you
know
or
if
you
do
know
you
ought
to
know
that
to
promote
your
welfare
has
always
been
the
supremest
of
my
desires
i
have
returned
to
you
here
to
explain
my
motive
in
making
the
alterations
in
those
books
and
to
account
for
the
peculiarities
of
those
verses
we
have
known
each
other
my
dear
boy
how
many
years
fifteen
tom
i
said
my
voice
husky
with
emotion
yes
fifteen
years
and
fifteen
happy
years
phil
happy
years
to
me
to
whom
the
friendship
of
one
who
understood
me
was
the
dearest
of
many
dear
possessions
from
the
moment
i
met
you
i
felt
i
had
at
last
a
friend
one
to
whom
my
very
self
might
be
confided
and
who
would
through
all
time
and
under
all
circumstances
prove
true
to
that
trust
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
were
my
soul
twin
phil
and
as
the
years
passed
on
and
we
grew
closer
to
each
other
when
the
rough
corners
of
my
nature
adapted
themselves
to
the
curves
of
yours
i
almost
began
to
think
that
we
were
but
one
soul
united
in
all
things
spiritual
two
only
in
matters
material
i
never
spoke
of
it
to
you
i
thought
of
it
in
communion
with
myself
i
never
thought
it
necessary
to
speak
of
it
to
you
for
i
was
satisfied
that
you
knew
i
did
not
realize
until
until
that
night
a
fortnight
since
when
almost
without
warning
i
found
myself
on
the
threshold
of
the
dark
valley
that
perhaps
i
was
mistaken
i
missed
you
and
so
sudden
was
the
attack
and
so
swiftly
did
the
heralds
of
death
intrude
upon
me
that
i
had
no
time
to
summon
you
as
i
wished
and
as
i
lay
there
upon
my
bed
to
the
watchers
unconscious
it
came
to
me
like
a
dash
of
cold
water
in
my
face
that
after
all
we
were
not
one
but
in
reality
two
for
had
we
been
one
you
would
have
known
of
the
perilous
estate
of
your
other
self
and
would
have
been
with
me
at
the
last
and
phil
the
realization
that
chilled
my
very
soul
that
showed
me
that
what
i
most
dearly
loved
to
believe
was
founded
in
unreality
reconciled
me
to
the
journey
i
was
about
to
take
into
other
worlds
for
i
knew
that
should
i
recover
life
could
never
seem
quite
the
same
to
me
here
bragdon
or
his
spirit
stopped
speaking
for
a
moment
and
i
tried
to
say
something
but
could
not
i
know
how
you
feel
phil
said
he
noticing
my
discomfiture
for
though
you
are
not
so
much
a
part
of
me
that
you
thoroughly
comprehend
me
i
have
become
so
much
a
part
of
you
that
your
innermost
thoughts
are
as
plain
to
me
as
though
they
were
mine
but
let
me
finish
i
realized
when
i
lay
ill
and
about
to
die
that
i
had
permitted
my
theory
of
happiness
to
obscure
my
perception
of
the
actual
as
you
know
my
whole
life
has
been
given
over
to
imagination
all
save
that
portion
of
my
existence
which
i
shall
not
dignify
by
calling
life
when
i
was
forced
by
circumstances
to
bring
myself
down
to
realities
i
did
not
live
whilst
in
commercial
pursuits
it
was
only
when
i
could
leave
business
behind
and
travel
in
fancy
wheresoever
i
wished
that
i
was
happy
and
in
those
moments
phil
i
was
full
of
aspiration
to
do
those
things
for
which
nature
had
not
fitted
me
and
to
the
extent
that
i
recognized
my
inability
to
do
those
things
i
failed
to
be
content
i
should
have
liked
to
be
a
great
writer
a
poet
a
great
dramatist
a
novelist
a
little
of
everything
in
the
literary
world
i
should
have
liked
to
know
shakespeare
to
have
been
the
friend
of
milton
and
when
i
came
out
of
my
dreams
it
made
me
unhappy
to
think
that
such
i
never
could
be
until
one
day
this
idea
came
to
me
all
the
happiness
of
life
is
bound
up
in
the
pretend
games
which
we
learn
in
childhood
and
no
harm
results
to
any
one
if
i
can
imagine
myself
off
with
my
friend
phil
marsden
in
the
lakes
of
england
and
scotland
in
the
african
jungle
in
the
moon
anywhere
and
enter
so
far
into
the
spirit
of
the
trips
as
to
feel
that
they
are
real
and
not
imagination
why
may
i
not
in
fancy
be
all
these
things
that
i
so
aspire
to
be
why
may
not
the
plays
of
shakespeare
become
the
plays
of
thomas
bragdon
why
may
not
the
poems
of
milton
become
the
poems
of
my
dearest
closest
friend
phil
marsden
what
is
to
prevent
my
achieving
the
highest
position
in
letters
art
politics
science
anything
in
imagination
i
acted
upon
the
thought
and
i
found
the
plan
worked
admirably
up
to
a
certain
point
it
was
easy
to
fancy
myself
the
author
of
until
i
took
my
copy
of
that
work
in
hand
to
read
and
then
it
would
shock
and
bring
me
back
to
earth
again
to
see
the
name
of
another
on
the
my
solution
of
this
vexatious
complication
was
soon
found
surely
thought
i
it
can
harm
no
one
if
i
choose
in
behalf
of
my
own
conceit
to
substitute
my
name
for
that
of
shakespeare
and
i
did
so
the
illusion
was
complete
indeed
it
became
no
illusion
for
my
eyes
did
not
deceive
me
i
saw
what
existed
the
of
by
thomas
bragdon
i
carried
the
plan
further
and
where
i
found
a
piece
of
literature
that
i
admired
there
i
made
the
substitution
of
my
name
for
that
of
the
real
author
and
in
the
case
of
that
delightful
copy
of
milton
you
gave
me
phil
it
pleased
me
to
believe
that
it
was
presented
to
me
by
the
author
only
the
inscription
on
the
made
it
necessary
for
me
to
foist
upon
you
the
burden
or
distinction
of
authorship
then
as
i
lived
on
in
my
imaginary
paradise
it
struck
me
that
for
one
who
had
done
such
great
things
in
letters
i
was
doing
precious
little
writing
and
i
bethought
me
of
a
plan
which
a
dreadful
reality
made
all
the
more
pleasing
i
looked
into
literature
to
a
slight
extent
and
i
perceived
at
once
that
originality
is
no
longer
possible
the
great
thoughts
have
been
thought
the
great
truths
have
been
grasped
and
made
clear
the
great
poems
have
been
written
i
saw
that
the
literature
of
is
either
an
echo
of
the
past
or
a
combination
of
the
ideas
of
many
in
the
productions
of
the
individual
and
upon
that
basis
i
worked
my
poems
are
combinations
i
have
taken
a
stanza
from
one
poet
and
combining
it
with
a
stanza
from
another
have
made
the
resulting
poem
my
own
and
in
so
far
as
i
have
made
no
effort
to
profit
thereby
i
have
been
clear
in
my
conscience
no
one
has
been
deceived
but
myself
though
i
saw
with
some
regret
this
evening
when
you
read
my
lines
that
you
were
puzzled
by
them
i
had
believed
that
you
understood
me
sufficiently
to
comprehend
them
here
my
ghostly
visitor
paused
a
moment
and
sighed
i
felt
as
though
some
explanation
of
my
lack
of
comprehension
early
in
the
evening
was
necessary
and
so
i
said
i
should
have
understood
you
tom
and
i
do
now
but
i
have
not
the
strength
of
imagination
that
you
have
you
are
wrong
there
phil
said
he
you
have
every
bit
as
strong
an
imagination
as
i
but
you
do
not
keep
it
in
form
you
do
not
exercise
it
enough
how
have
you
developed
your
muscles
by
constant
exercise
the
imagination
needs
to
be
kept
in
play
quite
as
much
as
the
muscles
if
we
do
not
wish
it
to
become
flabby
as
the
muscles
become
when
neglected
that
your
imagination
is
a
strong
one
is
shown
by
my
presence
before
you
in
reality
phil
i
am
lying
out
there
in
greenwood
cold
in
my
grave
your
imagination
places
me
here
and
as
applied
to
my
books
the
play
of
by
thomas
bragdon
and
my
poems
they
will
also
demonstrate
to
you
the
strength
of
your
fancy
if
you
will
show
them
say
to
your
janitor
morning
try
it
phil
and
see
but
this
is
only
a
part
my
boy
of
what
i
have
come
here
to
say
to
you
i
am
here
in
the
main
to
show
you
that
throughout
all
eternity
happiness
may
be
ours
if
we
but
take
advantage
of
our
fancy
do
you
take
delight
in
my
society
imagine
me
present
phil
and
i
will
be
present
there
need
be
no
death
for
us
there
need
be
no
separation
throughout
all
the
years
to
come
if
you
but
exercise
your
fancy
in
life
and
when
life
on
this
earth
ends
then
shall
we
be
reunited
according
to
nature
laws
phil
it
is
late
and
while
i
could
sit
here
and
talk
forever
without
weariness
you
who
have
yet
to
put
off
your
mortal
limitations
will
be
worn
out
if
i
remain
longer
we
shook
hands
affectionately
and
bragdon
vanished
as
unceremoniously
as
he
had
appeared
for
an
hour
after
his
departure
i
sat
reflecting
over
the
strange
events
of
the
evening
and
finally
worn
out
in
body
and
mind
dropped
off
into
sleep
when
i
awakened
it
was
late
in
the
forenoon
and
i
was
surprised
when
i
recalled
all
that
i
had
gone
through
to
feel
a
sense
of
exhilaration
i
was
certainly
thoroughly
rested
and
cares
which
had
weighed
rather
heavily
on
me
in
the
past
now
seemed
light
and
inconsiderable
my
apartments
never
looked
so
attractive
and
on
my
table
to
my
utter
surprise
and
delight
i
saw
several
objects
of
art
notably
a
bary
bronze
that
it
had
been
one
of
my
most
cherished
hopes
to
possess
where
they
came
from
i
singularly
enough
did
not
care
to
discover
suffice
it
to
say
that
they
have
remained
there
ever
since
nor
have
i
been
at
all
curious
to
know
to
whose
generosity
i
owe
them
though
when
that
afternoon
i
followed
bragdon
advice
and
showed
his
book
of
poems
and
the
volume
of
to
the
janitor
a
vague
notion
as
to
how
matters
really
stood
entered
my
mind
the
janitor
cast
his
eye
over
the
book
of
poems
when
i
asked
what
he
thought
of
it
nothin
much
he
said
you
goin
to
keep
a
diary
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
illustration
why
when
i
sees
people
with
handsome
blank
books
like
that
i
allus
supposes
that
their
object
indeed
and
yet
perhaps
he
was
not
wrong
i
did
not
question
it
but
handed
him
the
bragdon
read
that
page
aloud
to
me
i
said
indicating
the
and
turning
my
back
upon
him
almost
dreading
to
hear
him
speak
certainly
if
you
wish
it
but
are
you
feeling
well
this
morning
mr
marsden
very
i
replied
shortly
go
on
and
read
hamlet
prince
of
denmark
he
read
in
a
halting
sort
of
fashion
yes
yes
and
what
else
i
cried
impatiently
a
tragedy
by
william
shak
that
was
enough
for
me
i
understood
tom
and
at
last
i
understood
myself
i
grasped
the
book
from
the
janitor
hands
rather
roughly
i
fear
and
bade
him
begone
the
happiest
period
of
my
life
has
elapsed
since
then
i
understand
that
some
of
my
friends
profess
to
believe
me
queer
but
i
do
not
care
i
am
content
the
world
is
practically
mine
and
bragdon
and
i
are
always
together
the
end
