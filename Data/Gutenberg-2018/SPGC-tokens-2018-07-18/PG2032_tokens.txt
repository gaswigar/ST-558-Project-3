martin
pippin
in
the
apple
orchard
by
eleanor
farjeon
foreword
i
have
been
asked
to
introduce
miss
farjeon
to
the
american
public
and
although
i
believe
that
introductions
of
this
kind
often
do
more
harm
than
good
i
have
consented
in
this
case
because
the
instance
is
rare
enough
to
justify
an
exception
if
miss
farjeon
had
been
a
promising
young
novelist
either
of
the
realistic
or
the
romantic
school
i
should
not
have
dared
to
express
an
opinion
on
her
work
even
if
i
had
believed
that
she
had
greater
gifts
than
the
other
promising
young
novelists
who
appear
in
the
course
of
each
decade
but
she
has
a
far
rarer
gift
than
any
of
those
that
go
to
the
making
of
a
successful
novelist
she
is
one
of
the
few
who
can
conceive
and
tell
a
the
only
one
to
my
knowledge
with
the
just
possible
exceptions
of
james
stephens
and
walter
de
la
mare
in
my
own
generation
she
has
in
fact
the
true
gift
of
fancy
it
has
already
been
displayed
in
her
verse
a
form
in
which
it
is
far
commoner
than
in
prose
but
martin
pippin
is
her
first
book
in
this
kind
i
am
afraid
to
say
too
much
about
it
for
fear
of
prejudicing
both
the
reviewers
and
the
general
public
my
taste
may
not
be
theirs
and
in
this
matter
there
is
no
opportunity
for
argument
let
me
therefore
do
no
more
than
tell
the
story
of
how
the
manuscript
affected
me
i
was
a
little
overworked
i
had
been
reading
a
great
number
of
manuscripts
in
the
preceding
weeks
and
the
mere
sight
of
typescript
was
a
burden
to
me
but
before
i
had
read
five
pages
of
martin
pippin
i
had
forgotten
that
it
was
a
manuscript
submitted
for
my
judgment
i
had
forgotten
who
i
was
and
where
i
lived
i
was
transported
into
a
world
of
sunlight
of
gay
inconsequence
of
emotional
surprise
a
world
of
poetry
delight
and
humor
and
i
lived
and
took
my
joy
in
that
rare
world
until
all
too
soon
my
reading
was
done
my
most
earnest
wish
is
that
there
may
be
many
minds
and
imaginations
among
the
american
people
who
will
be
able
to
share
that
pleasure
with
me
for
every
one
who
finds
delight
in
this
book
i
can
claim
as
a
kindred
spirit

introduction
in
adversane
in
sussex
they
still
sing
the
song
of
the
lady
any
fine
evening
in
the
streets
or
in
the
meadows
you
may
come
upon
a
band
of
children
playing
the
old
game
that
is
their
heritage
though
few
of
them
know
its
origin
or
even
that
it
had
one
it
is
to
them
as
the
daisies
in
the
grass
and
the
stars
in
the
sky
of
these
things
and
such
as
these
they
ask
no
questions
but
there
you
will
still
find
one
child
who
takes
the
part
of
the
emperor
daughter
and
another
who
is
the
wandering
singer
and
the
remaining
group
there
should
be
no
more
than
six
in
it
becomes
the
lady
the
lady
the
lady
of
the
three
parts
of
the
game
often
there
are
more
than
six
in
the
group
for
the
true
number
of
the
damsels
who
guarded
their
fellow
in
her
prison
is
as
forgotten
as
their
names
joscelyn
jane
and
jennifer
jessica
joyce
and
joan
forgotten
too
the
name
of
gillian
the
lovely
captive
and
the
wandering
singer
is
to
them
but
the
wandering
singer
not
martin
pippin
the
minstrel
worse
and
worse
he
is
even
presumed
to
be
the
captive
sweetheart
who
wheedles
the
flower
the
ring
and
the
out
of
the
strict
virgins
for
his
own
purposes
and
flies
with
her
at
last
in
his
shallop
across
the
sea
to
live
with
her
happily
ever
after
but
this
is
a
fallacy
martin
pippin
never
wheedled
anything
out
of
anybody
for
his
own
purposes
in
fact
he
had
none
of
his
own
on
this
adventure
he
was
about
the
business
of
young
robin
rue
there
are
further
discrepancies
for
the
emperor
daughter
was
not
an
emperor
daughter
but
a
farmer
nor
was
the
sea
the
sea
but
a
duckpond
nor
but
let
us
begin
with
the
children
version
as
they
sing
and
dance
it
on
summer
days
and
evenings
in
adversane
the
of
the
lady
the
emperor
daughter
sits
weeping
in
her
tower
around
her
with
their
backs
to
her
stand
six
maids
in
a
ring
with
joined
hands
they
are
in
green
dresses
the
wandering
singer
approaches
them
with
his
lute
the
wandering
singer
lady
lady
my
lady
may
i
come
into
your
orchard
lady
for
the
leaf

lady
lady
my
fair
lady
o
my

the
ladies
you
may
not
come
into
our
orchard
singer
because
we
must
guard
the
emperor
daughter
who
hides
in
her
hair
at
the
windows
there
with
her
thoughts
a
thousand
leagues
over
the
water
singer
singer
wandering

o

but
will
you
not
hear
an

the
and
you
shall
dance
on
the
lawn
so
shady
lady

my
fair

o
my

the
ladies
o
if
you
play
us
an
alba
singer
how
can
that
harm
the
emperor
daughter
no
word
would
she
say
though
we
danced
all
day
with
her
thoughts
a
thousand
leagues
over
the
water
singer
singer
wandering
singer
o
my
singer
the
wandering
singer
but
if
i
play
you
an
alba
lady
get
me
a
boon
from
the
emperor
daughter
the
flower
from
her
hair
for
my
heart
to
wear
though
hers
be
a
thousand
leagues
over
the
water
lady
lady
my
fair
lady
o
my
lady
the
ladies
they
give
him
the
flower
from
the
hair
of
the
emperor
daughter
and
sing
now
you
may
play
us
an
alba
singer
a
dance
of
dawn
for
a
lady
for
the
leaf
is
now
on
the
and
the
sun
is
high
and
the
lawn
is
shady
singer
singer
wandering
singer
o
my
singer
the
wandering
singer
plays
on
his
lute
and
the
ladies
break
their
ranks
and
dance
the
singer
steals
up
behind
the
emperor
daughter
who
uncovers
her
face
and
sings
the
emperor
daughter
mother
mother
my
fair
dead
mother
they
have
stolen
the
flower
from
your
weeping
daughter
the
wandering
singer
o
dry
your
eyes
you
shall
have
this
other
when
yours
is
a
thousand
leagues
over
the
water
daughter
daughter
my
sweet
daughter
love
is
not
far
my
daughter
the
singer
then
drops
a
second
flower
into
the
lap
of
the
child
in
the
middle
and
goes
away
and
this
ends
the
first
part
of
the
game
the
emperor
daughter
is
not
yet
released
for
the
key
of
her
tower
is
understood
to
be
still
in
the
keeping
of
the
dancing
children
very
likely
it
is
by
this
and
mothers
are
calling
from
windows
and
gates
and
the
children
must
run
home
to
their
warm
and
their
cool
sheets
but
if
time
is
still
to
spare
the
second
part
of
the
game
is
played
like
this
the
dancers
once
more
encircle
their
weeping
comrade
and
now
they
are
gowned
in
white
and
pink
they
will
indicate
these
changes
perhaps
by
colored
ribbons
or
by
any
flower
in
its
season
or
by
imagining
themselves
first
in
green
and
then
in
rose
which
is
really
the
best
way
of
all
well
then
the
ladies
in
gowns
of
white
and
stand
around
the
emperor
daughter
weeping
in
her
tower
to
them
once
more
comes

wandering
singer
with
his
lute

daughter
the
third
part
of
the
game
is
seldom
played
if
it
is
not
or
or
or
by
this
time
at
all
events
the
players
have
grown
weary
of
the
game
which
is
tiresomely
long
and
most
likely
they
will
decide
to
play
something
else
such
as
bertha
gentle
lady
or
the
busy
lass
or
gypsy
gypsy
raggetty
loon
or
the
crock
of
gold
or
wayland
shoe
me
my
mare
which
are
all
good
games
in
their
way
though
not
like
the
lady
native
to
adversane
but
i
did
once
have
the
luck
to
hear
and
see
the
lady
played
in
entirety
the
children
had
been
granted
leave
to
play
just
one
more
game
before
and
of
course
they
chose
the
longest
and
played
it
without
missing
a
syllable
the
ladies
in
yellow
dresses
stand
again
in
a
ring
about
the
emperor
daughter
and
are
for
the
last
time
accosted
by

his
lute

guard

key

once
more
the
singer
plays
and
the
ladies
dance
but
one
by
one
they
fall
asleep
to
the
drowsy
music
and
then
the
singer
steps
into
the
ring
and
unlocks
the
tower
and
kisses
the
emperor
daughter
they
have
the
end
of
the
game
to
themselves
lover
lover
own
true
lover
has
opened
a
way
for
the
emperor
daughter
the
dawn
is
the
goal
and

dark
the
cover
as
we
sail
a
thousand
leagues
over

water
lover
lover
my
dear
lover
o
my
own
true
lover
the
wandering
singer
and
the
emperor

float
a
thousand
leagues
in
his
shallop
and
live
happily
ever
after
i
do
know
what
becomes
of
the
ladies
children
in
they
go
you
see
the
treatment
is
a
trifle
fanciful
but
romance
gathers
round
an
old
story
like
lichen
on
an
old
branch
and
the
story
of
martin
pippin
in
the
is
so
old
now
some
say
a
year
old
some
say
even
two
how
can
the
children
be
expected
to
remember
but
here
the
truth
of
it
martin
pippin
in
the
prologue
part
i
one
morning
in
april
martin
pippin
walked
in
the
meadows
near
adversane
and
there
he
saw
a
young
fellow
sowing
a
field
with
oats
broadcast
so
pleasant
a
sight
was
enough
to
arrest
martin
for
an
hour
though
less
important
things
such
as
making
his
living
could
not
occupy
him
for
a
minute
so
he
leaned
upon
the
gate
and
presently
noticed
that
for
every
handful
he
scattered
the
young
man
shed
as
many
tears
as
seeds
and
now
and
then
he
stopped
his
sowing
altogether
and
putting
his
face
between
his
hands
sobbed
bitterly
when
this
had
happened
three
or
four
times
martin
hailed
the
youth
who
was
then
fairly
close
to
the
gate
young
master
said
he
the
baker
of
this
crop
will
want
no
salt
to
his
baking
and
that
flat
the
young
man
dropped
his
hands
and
turned
his
brown
and
countenance
upon
the
minstrel
he
was
so
young
a
man
that
he
wanted
his
beard
they
who
taste
of
my
sorrow
he
replied
will
have
no
stomach
for
bread
and
with
that
he
fell
anew
to
his
sowing
and
sighing
and
passed
up
the
field
when
he
came
down
again
martin
observed
it
must
be
a
very
bitter
sorrow
that
will
put
a
man
off
his
dinner
it
is
the
bitterest
said
the
youth
and
went
his
way
at
his
next
coming
martin
inquired
what
is
the
name
of
your
sorrow
love
said
the
youth
by
now
he
was
somewhat
distant
from
the
gate
when
he
came
abreast
of
it
and
martin
pippin
did
not
catch
the
word
so
he
called
louder
what
love
shouted
the
youth
his
voice
cracked
on
it
he
appeared
slightly
annoyed
martin
chewed
a
grass
and
watched
him
up
and
down
the
meadow
at
the
right
moment
he
bellowed
i
was
never
yet
put
off
my
feed
by
love
then
roared
the
youth
you
have
never
loved
at
this
martin
jumped
over
the
gate
and
ran
along
the
furrow
behind
the
boy
i
have
loved
he
vowed
as
many
times
as
i
have
tuned
then
said
the
youth
not
turning
his
head
you
have
never
loved
in
vain
always
thank
god
said
martin
fervently
the
youth
whose
name
was
robin
rue
suddenly
dropped
all
his
seed
in
one
heap
flung
up
his
arms
and
alas
he
cried
oh
gillian
gillian
and
began
to
sob
more
heavily
than
ever
tell
me
your
trouble
said
the
minstrel
kindly
sir
said
the
youth
i
do
not
know
your
name
and
your
clothes
are
very
tattered
but
you
are
the
first
who
has
cared
whether
or
no
my
heart
should
break
since
my
lovely
gillian
was
locked
with
six
keys
into
her
father
and
six
young
milkmaids
sworn
virgins
and
all
to
keep
the
keys
the
thirsty
said
martin
make
little
of
padlocks
when
within
a
rope
length
of
water
but
sir
continued
the
youth
earnestly
this
is
set
in
the
midst
of
an
enclosed
in
a
hawthorn
hedge
full
six
feet
high
and
no
entrance
thereto
but
one
small
green
wicket
bolted
on
the
inner
side
indeed
said
martin
and
worse
to
come
the
length
of
the
hedge
there
is
a
great
duckpond
nine
yards
broad
and
three
wild
ducks
swimming
on
it
alas
he
cried
i
shall
never
see
my
lovely
girl
again
love
is
a
mighty
power
said
martin
pippin
but
there
are
doubtless
things
it
can
not
do
i
ask
so
little
sighed
robin
rue
only
to
send
her
a
primrose
for
her
and
have
again
whatever
flower
she
wears
there
now
would
this
really
content
you
said
martin
pippin
i
would
then
consent
to
live
swore
robin
rue
long
enough
at
all
events
to
make
an
end
of
my
sowing
well
that
would
be
something
said
martin
cheerfully
for
fields
must
not
go
fallow
that
are
appointed
to
bear
direct
me
to
your
gillian
it
is
useless
robin
said
for
even
if
you
could
cross
the
duckpond
and
evade
the
ducks
and
compass
the
green
gate
my
father
milkmaids
are
not
to
be
come
over
by
any
man
and
they
watch
the
day
and
night
yet
direct
me
to
the
orchard
repeated
martin
pippin
and
thrummed
his
lute
a
little
oh
sir
said
robin
anxiously
i
must
warn
you
that
it
is
a
long
and
weary
way
it
may
be
as
much
as
two
mile
by
the
road
and
he
looked
disconsolately
at
the
minstrel
as
though
in
fear
that
he
would
be
discouraged
from
the
adventure
it
can
but
be
attempted
answered
martin
and
now
tell
me
only
whether
i
go
north
or
south
as
the
road
runs
gillman
the
farmer
her
father
said
robin
rue
has
moreover
a
very
big
stick
heaven
help
us
cried
martin
and
took
to
his
heels
that
ends
it
sighed
the
sorry
lover
at
least
let
us
make
a
beginning
quoth
martin
pippin
he
leaped
the
gate
mocked
at
a
cuckoo
plucked
a
primrose
and
went
singing
up
the
road
robin
rue
resumed
his
sowing
and
his
tears
maids
said
joscelyn
what
is
this
coming
across
the
duckpond
it
is
a
man
said
little
joan
the
six
girls
came
running
and
crowding
to
the
wicket
standing
and
peeping
between
each
other
sunbonnets
their
sunbonnets
and
their
gowns
were
as
green
as
is
he
coming
on
a
raft
asked
jessica
who
stood
behind
no
said
jane
he
is
coming
on
his
two
feet
he
has
taken
off
his
shoes
but
i
fear
his
breeches
will
suffer
he
is
giving
bread
to
the
ducks
said
jennifer
he
has
a
lute
on
his
back
said
joyce
man
cried
joscelyn
who
was
the
tallest
and
the
sternest
of
the
milkmaids
go
away
at
once
martin
pippin
was
by
now
within
of
the
green
gate
he
looked
with
pleasure
at
the
six
virgins
fluttering
in
their
green
gowns
and
peeping
and
under
their
green
bonnets
beyond
them
he
saw
the
forbidden
orchard
with
and
primrose
daffodil
and
celandine
silver
windflower
and
sweet
violets
blue
and
white
spangling
the
gay
grass
the
twisted
were
in
young
leaf
go
away
cried
all
the
milkmaids
in
a
breath
go
away
my
green
maidens
said
martin
may
i
not
come
into
your
orchard
the
sun
is
up
and
the
shadow
lies
fresh
on
the
grass
let
me
in
to
rest
a
little
dear
maidens
if
maidens
indeed
you
be
and
not
six
leaflets
blown
from
the
you
can
not
come
in
said
joscelyn
because
we
are
guarding
our
master
daughter
who
sits
yonder
weeping
in
the
that
is
a
noble
and
a
tender
duty
said
martin
from
what
do
you
guard
her
the
milkmaids
looked
primly
at
one
another
and
little
joan
said
it
is
a
secret
martin
i
will
ask
no
more
and
what
do
you
do
all
day
long
joyce
nothing
and
it
is
very
dull
martin
it
must
be
still
duller
for
your
master
daughter
joan
oh
no
she
has
her
thoughts
to
play
with
martin
and
what
of
your
thoughts
joscelyn
we
have
no
thoughts
i
should
think
not
indeed
martin
i
beg
your
pardon
but
since
you
find
the
hours
so
tedious
will
you
not
let
me
sing
and
play
to
you
upon
my
lute
i
will
sing
you
a
song
for
a
spring
morning
and
you
shall
dance
in
the
grass
like
any
leaf
in
the
wind
jane
i
think
there
can
be
no
harm
in
that
jessica
it
ca
matter
a
straw
to
gillian
joyce
she
would
not
look
up
from
her
thoughts
though
we
footed
it
all
day
joscelyn
so
long
as
he
is
on
one
side
of
the
gate
jennifer
and
we
on
the
other
i
love
to
dance
said
little
joan
man
cried
the
milkmaids
in
a
breath
play
and
sing
to
us
oh
maidens
answered
martin
merrily
every
tune
deserves
its
fee
but
do
look
so
troubled
my
hire
shall
be
of
the
lightest
let
me
see
you
shall
fetch
me
the
flower
from
the
hair
of
your
little
mistress
who
sits
weeping
on
the
coping
with
her
face
hidden
in
her
shining
locks
at
this
the
milkmaids
clapped
their
hands
and
little
joan
running
to
the
with
a
touch
like
thistledown
drew
from
the
yellow
hair
a
yellow
primrose
she
brought
it
to
the
gate
and
laid
it
in
martin
hand
now
you
will
play
for
us
wo
you
said
she
a
dance
for
a
when
the
leaves
dance
on
the
then
martin
tuned
his
lute
and
played
and
sang
as
follows
while
the
girls
took
hands
and
danced
in
a
green
chain
among
the
twisty
trees
the
green
leaf
dances
now
the
green
leaf
dances
now
the
green
leaf
with
its
tilted
wings
dances
on
the
bough
and
every
rustling
air
says
i
caught
you
caught
you
leaf
with
tilted
wings
caught
you
in
a
snare
whose
snare
spring
that
bound
you
to
the
bough
where
you
dance
now
dance
but
can
not
fly
for
all
your
tilted
wings
pointing
to
the
sky
where
like
martins
you
would
dart
but
for
spring
delicious
art
that
caught
you
to
the
bough
caught
yet
left
you
free
to
dance
if
not
to
fly
oh
see
as
you
are
dancing
now
dancing
on
the
bough
dancing
on
the
bough
dancing
with
your
tilted
wings
on
the
now
as
martin
sang
and
the
milkmaids
danced
it
seemed
that
gillian
in
her
prison
heard
and
saw
nothing
except
the
music
and
the
movement
of
her
sorrows
but
presently
she
raised
her
hand
and
touched
her
and
then
she
lifted
up
the
fairest
face
martin
had
ever
seen
so
that
he
needs
must
see
it
nearer
and
he
took
the
green
gate
in
one
stride
and
the
green
dancers
never
observed
him
then
tender
mouth
parted
like
an
opening
and
oh
mother
mother
she
said
if
you
had
only
lived
they
would
not
have
stolen
the
flower
from
my
hair
while
i
sat
weeping
above
her
head
a
whispering
voice
made
answer
oh
daughter
daughter
dry
your
sweet
eyes
you
shall
wear
this
other
flower
when
yours
is
gone
over
the
duckpond
to
adversane
and
lo
a
second
primrose
dropped
out
of
the
skies
into
her
lap
and
that
day
the
lovely
gillian
wept
no
more
part
ii
it
happened
that
on
an
afternoon
in
may
martin
pippin
passed
again
through
adversane
and
as
he
passed
he
thought
now
certainly
i
have
been
here
before
but
he
could
not
remember
when
or
how
for
a
full
month
had
run
under
the
bridges
of
time
since
then
and
man
memory
is
not
infinite
but
in
walking
by
a
certain
garden
he
heard
a
sound
of
sobbing
and
curiosity
of
which
he
was
largely
made
caused
him
to
climb
the
old
brick
wall
that
he
might
discover
the
cause
what
he
saw
from
his
perch
was
a
garden
laid
out
in
neat
plots
between
grassy
walks
edged
with
double
daisies
red
white
and
pink
or
bordered
with
sweet
herbs
or
with
lavender
and
wallflower
and
here
and
there
were
cordons
of
apple
plum
and
cherry
and
in
a
sunny
corner
a
clump
of
flowering
currant
heavy
with
humming
bees
and
against
the
inner
walls
flat
stretched
their
long
straight
lines
like
whereon
a
lovely
melody
was
written
in
notes
of
snow
and
in
the
midst
of
all
this
stood
a
very
young
man
with
a
face
as
brown
as
a
berry
he
was
spraying
the
cordons
with
but
whenever
he
filled
his
syringe
he
wept
so
many
tears
above
the
bucket
that
it
was
always
full
to
the
brim
when
he
had
watched
this
happen
several
times
martin
hailed
the
young
man
young
master
said
martin
the
eater
of
your
plums
will
need
sugar
thereto
and
that
flat
the
young
man
turned
his
eyes
upward
there
is
not
sugar
enough
in
all
the
world
he
answered
to
sweeten
the
fruits
that
are
watered
by
my
sorrows
then
here
is
a
waste
of
good
quassia
said
martin
and
i
think
your
name
is
robin
rue
it
is
said
robin
and
you
are
martin
pippin
to
whom
i
owe
more
than
to
any
man
living
but
the
primrose
you
brought
me
is
dead
this
days
and
what
of
your
gillian
alas
how
can
i
tell
what
of
her
she
is
where
she
was
and
i
am
here
where
i
am
what
will
become
of
me
there
are
riddles
without
answers
observed
martin
i
can
answer
this
one
i
shall
fall
into
a
decline
and
die
and
yet
i
ask
no
more
than
to
send
her
a
ring
to
wear
on
her
finger
and
have
her
ring
to
wear
on
mine
would
this
satisfy
you
asked
martin
i
could
then
cling
to
life
said
robin
rue
long
enough
at
least
to
finish
my
spraying
we
may
praise
god
as
much
for
small
mercies
said
martin
pleasantly
as
for
great
ones
and
trees
must
not
be
blighted
that
were
appointed
to
fruit
so
saying
he
unstraddled
his
legs
and
dropped
into
the
road
tickled
an
armadillo
with
his
toe
twirled
the
silver
ring
on
his
finger
and
went
away
singing
maidens
said
joscelyn
here
is
that
man
come
again
maids
memories
are
longer
than
men
at
all
events
the
milkmaids
knew
instantly
to
whom
she
referred
although
nearly
a
month
had
passed
since
his
coming
has
he
his
lute
with
him
asked
little
joan
he
has
and
he
is
giving
cake
to
the
ducks
they
take
it
from
his
hand
man
go
away
immediately
martin
pippin
propped
his
elbows
on
the
little
gate
and
looked
smiling
into
the
orchard
all
pink
and
white
blossom
the
trees
that
had
been
longest
in
bloom
were
white
cascades
of
flower
others
there
were
flushed
like
the
cheek
of
a
sleeping
child
and
some
were
still
studded
with
buds
the
grass
was
high
and
full
of
spotted
orchis
and
tall
wild
parsley
spread
its
nets
of
lace
almost
abreast
of
the
lowest
boughs
of
blossom
so
that
the
milkmaids
stood
embraced
in
meeting
flowers
in
the
orchard
growth
all
gowned
in
pink
lawn
with
loose
white
sleeves
and
their
faces
flushed
it
may
have
been
with
the
pink
linings
to
their
white
bonnets
or
with
the
evening
rose
in
the
west
or
with
i
know
not
what
go
away
they
cried
at
the
intruder
go
away
my
maidens
said
martin
will
you
not
let
me
into
your
orchard
for
the
stars
are
rising
with
the
dew
and
the
hour
is
at
peace
let
me
in
to
rest
dear
maidens
if
maidens
indeed
you
be
and
not
six
blossoms
fallen
from
the
you
can
not
come
in
said
joscelyn
lest
you
are
the
bearer
of
a
word
to
our
master
daughter
who
sits
weeping
in
the
from
whom
should
i
bear
her
a
word
asked
martin
pippin
in
great
amazement
the
milkmaids
cast
down
their
eyes
and
little
joan
said
it
is
a
secret
martin
i
will
inquire
no
further
but
shall
i
not
play
a
little
on
my
lute
it
is
as
good
an
hour
for
song
and
dance
as
any
other
and
i
will
make
a
tune
for
a
sunny
may
evening
and
you
shall
sway
among
the
grasses
like
any
flower
on
the
bough
jane
in
my
opinion
that
can
hurt
nobody
jessica
gillian
would
care
two
pins
joyce
she
would
utter
no
word
though
we
tripped
it
for
a
week
joscelyn
so
long
as
he
keeps
to
his
side
of
the
hedge
jennifer
and
we
to
ours
oh
i
do
love
to
dance
cried
little
joan
man
they
commanded
him
as
one
voice
play
and
sing
to
us
instantly
my
pretty
ones
laughed
martin
pippin
songs
are
as
light
as
air
but
worth
more
than
pearls
and
diamonds
what
will
you
give
me
for
my
song
wait
now
i
have
it
you
shall
fetch
me
the
ring
from
the
finger
of
your
little
mistress
who
sits
hidden
beneath
the
fountain
of
her
own
bright
tresses
the
milkmaids
at
these
words
nodded
gayly
and
little
joan
to
the
and
slipped
the
ring
from
gillian
finger
as
lightly
as
a
daisy
may
be
slipped
from
its
fellow
on
the
chain
then
she
ran
with
it
to
the
gate
and
martin
held
up
his
little
finger
and
she
put
it
on
saying
now
you
will
keep
your
promise
singer
and
play
a
dance
for
a
may
evening
when
the
blossom
blows
for
happiness
on
the
so
martin
pippin
tuned
his
lute
and
sang
what
follows
while
the
girls
floated
in
ones
and
twos
among
the
orchard
grass
what
saw
i
fairy
ships
rocking
with
pink
sails
and
white
smoothly
as
swans
on
a
river
of
light
saw
i
no
it
was
rosy
and
fair
softly
obeying
the
nod
of
the
air
i
saw
what
saw
i
white
clouds
at
eventide
blown
to
and
fro
lightly
as
bubbles
the
cherubim
blow
saw
i
no
it
was
pretty
girls
gowned
like
a
flower
blown
in
a
ring
round
their
own
i
saw
or
was
it
my
dream
my
dream
only
who
knows
as
frail
as
a
snowflake
as
flushed
as
a
rose
i
saw
what
saw
i
martin
sang
and
the
milkmaids
danced
and
gillian
in
her
prison
only
heard
the
dropping
of
her
tears
and
only
saw
the
rainbow
prisms
on
her
lashes
but
presently
she
laid
her
cheek
against
her
hand
and
missed
a
touch
she
knew
and
on
that
revealed
her
lovely
face
so
full
of
woe
that
martin
needs
must
comfort
her
or
weep
himself
and
the
dancers
took
no
heed
when
he
made
one
step
across
the
gate
and
went
under
the
trees
to
the
oh
mother
mother
sighed
gillian
if
you
had
only
lived
they
would
never
have
stolen
the
ring
from
my
finger
while
i
sat
heartsick
above
her
head
a
whispering
voice
replied
oh
daughter
daughter
mend
your
dear
heart
you
shall
wear
this
other
ring
when
yours
is
gone
over
the
duckpond
to
adversane
oh
wonder
out
of
the
very
heavens
fell
a
silver
ring
into
her
bosom
and
if
that
night
gillian
slept
not
neither
wept
she
part
iii
in
the
beginning
of
the
first
week
in
september
martin
pippin
came
once
more
to
adversane
and
he
said
to
himself
when
he
saw
it
now
this
is
the
prettiest
hamlet
i
ever
had
the
luck
to
light
on
in
my
wanderings
and
if
chance
or
fortune
will
i
shall
some
day
come
this
way
again
while
he
was
thinking
these
thoughts
his
ears
were
assailed
by
groans
and
sighs
so
that
he
wet
his
finger
and
held
it
up
to
find
which
way
the
wind
blew
on
this
burning
day
of
blue
and
gold
but
no
wind
coming
he
sought
some
other
agency
for
these
gusts
and
discovered
it
in
a
where
was
a
young
fellow
stooking
sheaves
a
very
young
fellow
he
was
turned
copper
by
the
sun
and
as
he
stooked
he
heaved
such
sighs
that
for
every
shock
he
stooked
two
tumbled
at
his
feet
when
martin
had
seen
this
happen
more
than
once
he
called
aloud
to
the
harvester
young
master
said
martin
the
mill
that
grinds
your
grain
will
need
no
wind
to
its
sails
and
that
flat
the
young
man
looked
up
from
his
labors
to
reply
there
are
no
in
all
the
world
said
he
strong
enough
to
grind
the
grain
of
my
grief
then
i
would
save
these
gales
till
they
may
be
put
to
more
use
remarked
martin
and
if
i
remember
rightly
you
wear
a
lady
ring
on
your
little
finger
though
i
can
not
remember
her
name
or
yours
her
heavenly
name
is
gillian
said
the
youth
and
mine
is
robin
rue
and
are
you
wedded
yet
asked
martin
wedded
he
cried
have
you
forgotten
that
she
is
locked
with
six
keys
inside
her
father
but
this
was
long
ago
said
martin
is
she
there
yet
she
is
said
robin
rue
and
here
am
i
well
all
states
must
end
some
time
said
martin
pippin
even
life
sighed
robin
and
therefore
before
the
month
is
out
i
shall
wilt
and
be
laid
in
the
earth
that
would
be
a
pity
said
martin
can
nothing
save
you
nothing
but
the
keys
to
her
prison
and
they
are
in
the
keeping
of
them
that
will
not
give
them
up
i
remember
said
martin
six
milkmaids
with
hearts
of
flint
cried
robin
sparks
may
be
struck
from
flint
said
martin
in
his
inconsequential
way
but
tell
me
if
gillian
prison
were
indeed
unlocked
would
all
be
well
with
you
for
ever
oh
said
robin
rue
if
her
prison
were
unlocked
and
the
prisoner
in
these
arms
this
wheat
should
be
flour
for
a
it
is
the
best
of
all
cakes
said
martin
pippin
and
the
grain
that
is
destined
thereto
must
not
rot
in
the
husk
with
these
words
he
strolled
out
of
the
cornfield
gathered
a
harebell
rang
it
so
loudly
in
the
ear
of
a
passing
rabbit
that
it
is
said
never
to
have
stopped
running
till
it
found
itself
in
france
and
went
up
the
road
humming
and
thrumming
his
lute
on
the
road
he
met
a
gypsy
maids
said
joscelyn
somebody
is
at
the
gate
the
milkmaids
who
were
eating
apples
came
clustering
about
her
instantly
is
it
a
man
asked
little
joan
pausing
between
her
bites
no
thank
all
our
stars
said
joscelyn
it
is
a
gypsy
the
milkmaids
withdrew
their
fears
allayed
joan
bit
her
apple
and
said
it
puckers
my
mouth
joyce

sour
jessica

joscelyn
severely

pretty

crouched
in
the
oh
gypsy
cried
joscelyn
have
you
among
your
charms
one
that
will
make
a
maid
fall
out
of
love
nay
nay
said
the
gypsy
growing
suddenly
grave
that
is
a
charm
takes
more
black
art
than
i
am
mistress
of
i
know
indeed
of
but
one
remedy
is
the
case
so
bad
she
has
been
shut
into
the
to
cure
her
of
loving
said
joscelyn
and
in
six
months
she
has
scarcely
ceased
to
weep
and
has
never
uttered
a
word
if
you
know
the
physic
that
shall
heal
her
of
her
foolishness
i
pray
you
tell
us
of
it
for
it
is
extremely
dull
in
this
orchard
with
nothing
to
do
except
watch
the
changes
of
the
and
meanwhile
the
farmstead
lacks
water
and
milk
there
being
no
entry
to
the
well
nor
maids
to
milk
the
cows
daily
comes
old
gillman
to
tell
us
how
from
morning
till
night
he
is
forced
to
drink
cider
and
ale
and
so
the
farm
goes
to
rack
and
ruin
and
all
because
he
has
a
lovesick
daughter
what
is
your
remedy
he
would
give
you
gold
and
silver
for
it
i
do
not
know
if
it
can
be
bought
said
the
gypsy
i
do
not
even
know
if
it
exists
but
when
a
maid
broods
too
much
on
her
own
the
like
weapons
only
will
vanquish
her
thoughts
nothing
but
a
new
will
overcome
her
broodings
and
where
the
case
is
obstinate
one
only
will
not
suffice
you
say
she
has
pined
upon
her
love
six
months
let
her
be
told
six
tales
which
no
woman
ever
heard
before
and
i
think
she
will
be
cured
these
will
so
work
in
her
that
little
by
little
her
own
case
will
be
obliterated
from
her
blood
but
for
my
part
i
doubt
whether
there
be
six
untold
left
on
earth
and
if
there
be
i
know
not
who
keeps
them
buttoned
under
his
jacket
alas
cried
joscelyn
then
we
must
stay
here
for
ever
until
we
die
it
looks
very
like
it
said
the
gypsy
and
my
wares
are
a
penny
apiece
so
saying
she
collected
her
moneys
and
withdrew
and
for
all
i
know
was
never
seen
again
by
man
woman
or
child
my
maidens
said
martin
pippin
leaning
on
the
gate
in
the
bright
night
may
i
come
into
your
orchard
as
he
addressed
them
he
gazed
with
delight
at
the
enclosure
by
the
light
of
the
queen
moon
now
at
her
full
in
heaven
he
saw
that
the
orchard
grass
was
clipped
and
patterned
with
small
clover
but
against
the
hedges
rose
wild
banks
of
and
yarrow
and
the
jolly
ragwort
and
briony
with
its
leaf
and
berry
as
red
as
made
a
bower
above
them
all
and
all
the
were
decked
with
little
golden
moons
hanging
in
clusters
on
the
drooping
boughs
and
glimmering
in
the
recesses
of
the
leaves
under
each
tree
a
ring
of
windfalls
lay
in
the
grass
but
prettiest
sight
of
all
was
the
ring
of
girls
in
yellow
gowns
and
caps
that
lay
around
the
midmost
like
fallen
fruit
dear
maidens
pleaded
the
minstrel
let
me
come
in
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
six
milkmaids
rose
up
in
the
grass
like
golden
fountains
and
fountains
indeed
they
were
for
their
eyes
were
running
over
with
tears
we
did
not
hear
you
coming
said
little
joan
go
away
at
once
commanded
joscelyn
then
all
the
girls
cried
go
away
together
my
maidens
said
martin
pippin
i
entreat
you
to
let
me
in
for
the
moon
is
up
and
it
is
time
to
be
sleeping
or
waking
in
sweet
company
so
i
beseech
you
to
admit
me
dear
maidens
if
maidens
in
truth
you
be
and
not
six
apples
bobbed
off
their
stems
you
may
not
come
in
said
joscelyn
in
case
you
should
release
our
master
daughter
who
sits
in
the
pining
to
follow
her
heart
why
whither
would
she
follow
it
asked
martin
much
surprised
the
milkmaids
turned
their
faces
away
and
little
joan
murmured
it
is
a
secret
martin
i
will
put
chains
on
my
thoughts
but
shall
i
not
sing
you
a
tune
you
may
dance
to
i
will
make
you
a
song
for
an
august
night
when
the
moon
rocks
her
way
up
and
down
the
cradle
of
the
sky
and
you
shall
rock
on
earth
like
any
apple
on
the
twig
jane
for
my
part
i
see
nothing
against
it
jessica
gillian
wo
care
little
apples
joyce
she
would
not
hear
though
we
danced
the
round
of
the
year
joscelyn
so
long
as
he
does
not
come
in
jennifer
or
we
go
out
oh
let
us
dance
do
let
us
dance
cried
little
joan
man
they
importuned
him
in
a
single
breath
play
for
us
and
sing
for
us
as
quickly
as
you
can
sweet
ones
said
martin
pippin
shaking
his
head
songs
must
be
paid
for
and
yet
i
do
not
know
what
to
ask
you
some
trifle
in
kind
it
should
be
why
now
i
have
it
if
i
give
you
the
keys
to
the
dance
give
me
the
keys
to
your
little
mistress
that
i
may
keep
her
secure
from
following
her
heart
like
a
bird
of
passage
whither
it
no
business
of
mine
to
ask
at
this
request
made
so
gayly
and
so
carelessly
the
girls
all
looked
at
one
another
in
consternation
then
joscelyn
drew
herself
up
to
full
height
and
pointing
with
her
arm
straight
across
the
duckpond
she
cried
minstrel
begone
and
the
six
girls
turning
their
backs
upon
him
moved
away
into
the
shadows
of
the
moon
sighed
martin
pippin
how
a
fool
may
trip
and
never
know
it
till
his
nose
hits
the
earth
i
will
sing
to
you
for
nothing
but
the
girls
did
not
answer
then
martin
touched
his
lute
and
sang
as
follows
so
softly
and
sweetly
that
they
not
regarding
hardly
knew
the
sound
of
his
song
from
the
scent
of
the
ungathered
apples
over
their
heads
toss
me
your
golden
ball
laughing
maid
lovely
maid

laughing
maid
toss
me

and
not
let
it
fall
boy
run
away
with
you
i
will
not
play
with

this

toss

golden

lovely

laughing
maid
toss
me

i
wheel

i
whirl

i
twist

and
twirl

till

at

made
for
a
girl
and
a
boy
there
was
no
sound
or
movement
from
the
girls
in
the
shadows
farewell
then
said
martin
i
must
carry
my
tunes
and
tales
elsewhere
like
pebbles
from
a
catapult
the
milkmaids
shot
to
the
gate
tales
cried
jessica
do
you
know
tales
exclaimed
jennifer
what
kind
of
tales
demanded
jane
panted
joyce
six
of
them
urged
little
joan
a
thousand
said
martin
pippin
joscelyn
hand
lay
on
the
bolt
man
she
said
come
in
she
opened
the
wicket
and
martin
pippin
walked
into
the
apple
orchard
prelude
to
the
first
tale
and
now
said
martin
pippin
what
exactly
do
you
require
of
me
if
you
please
said
little
joan
you
are
to
tell
us
a
that
has
never
been
told
before
but
we
have
reason
to
fear
added
jane
that
there
is
no
such
story
left
in
all
the
world
there
you
are
wrong
said
martin
for
on
the
contrary
no
has
ever
been
told
twice
i
never
heard
any
tale
of
lovers
that
did
not
seem
to
me
as
new
as
the
world
on
its
first
morning
i
am
glad
you
have
a
taste
for
we
have
not
said
joscelyn
very
quickly
no
indeed
cried
her
five
fellows
then
shall
it
be
some
other
kind
of
tale
no
other
kind
will
do
said
joscelyn
still
more
quickly
we
must
all
bear
our
burdens
said
martin
so
let
us
make
ourselves
as
happy
as
we
can
in
an
and
when
the
tale
becomes
too
little
to
your
taste
you
shall
munch
apples
and
forget
it
will
you
sit
in
the
swing
asked
jennifer
pointing
to
the
midmost
which
was
the
largest
in
the
orchard
and
had
a
little
swing
hanging
from
a
long
upper
limb
close
to
the
a
branch
of
which
indeed
brushed
its
mossed
stood
the
it
had
a
round
wall
of
old
red
bricks
growing
green
with
time
and
a
pillar
of
oak
rose
up
at
each
point
of
the
compass
to
support
the
pent
between
the
south
and
west
pillars
was
a
green
door
held
by
a
rusty
chain
and
a
padlock
with
six
keyholes
the
little
circular
court
within
was
flagged
and
three
rings
of
worn
steps
led
to
the
and
the
green
wooden
bucket
inverted
on
the
coping
between
the
cracks
of
the
flags
sprang
grass
and
centaury
and
even
a
trail
of
mallow
sprawled
over
the
steps
where
gillian
lay
in
tears
as
though
to
wreathe
her
head
with
its
striped
blooms
what
luck
you
have
said
martin
not
only
to
live
in
an
orchard
but
to
have
a
swing
to
swing
in
it
is
our
one
diversion
said
joyce
except
when
you
come
to
play
to
us
it
is
delightful
to
swing
said
little
joan
invitingly
so
it
is
agreed
martin
and
i
beg
you
to
sit
in
the
swing
while
i
sit
on
this
bough
and
when
i
see
your
eyelids
growing
heavy
with
my
tale
i
will
start
the
rope
and
rouse
you
thus
so
saying
he
lifted
the
littlest
milkmaid
lightly
into
her
perch
and
gave
her
so
vigorous
a
push
that
she
cried
out
with
delight
as
at
one
moment
the
point
of
her
shoe
cleared
the
door
of
the
and
at
the
next
her
heels
were
up
among
the
apples
then
martin
ensconced
himself
upon
a
lower
limb
of
the
tree
which
had
a
mossy
cushion
against
the
trunk
as
though
nature
or
time
had
designed
it
for
a
teller
of
tales
the
milkmaids
sprang
quickly
into
other
branches
around
him
shaking
a
hail
of
sweet
apples
about
his
head
what
he
could
he
caught
and
dropped
into
the
swinger
lap
whence
from
time
to
time
he
helped
himself
and
she
did
likewise
begin
said
joscelyn
a
thought
has
occurred
to
me
said
martin
pippin
and
it
is
that
my
tale
may
disturb
your
master
daughter
we
desire
it
to
said
joscelyn
looking
down
on
the
and
the
yellow
head
of
gillian
the
fear
is
rather
that
you
may
not
arouse
her
attention
so
i
hope
that
when
you
speak
you
will
speak
clearly
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
we
have
heard
that
nothing
but
six
will
wash
from
her
mind
the
image
of
of
whom
inquired
martin
as
she
paused
it
does
not
matter
whom
said
joscelyn
but
i
think
the
time
is
ripe
to
confess
to
you
that
the
silly
damsel
is
in
love
the
world
is
so
full
of
wonders
said
martin
pippin
that
one
ceases
to
be
surprised
at
almost
anything
is
love
then
said
little
joan
so
rare
a
thing
in
the
world
the
rarest
of
all
things
answered
martin
looking
gravely
into
her
eyes
it
is
as
rare
as
flowers
in
spring
i
am
glad
of
that
said
joan
while
joscelyn
objected
but
nothing
is
commoner
do
you
think
so
said
martin
perhaps
you
are
right
yet
spring
after
spring
the
flowers
quicken
my
heart
as
though
i
were
perceiving
them
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
yes
even
the
very
commonest
of
them
what
do
you
call
the
commonest
asked
jessica
could
any
be
commoner
said
martin
than
yet
i
think
he
has
touched
many
a
heart
in
his
day
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
weeper
in
the
martin
pippin
tried
his
lute
and
sang
this
song
run
by
the
wall
robin
run
by
the
wall
you
might
hear
a
secret
a
lady
once
let
fall
if
you
hear
her
secret
tell
it
in
my
ear
and
i
whisper
you
another
for
her
to
overhear
the
weeper
stirred
very
slightly
the
song
makes
little
sense
said
joscelyn
and
would
make
none
at
all
if
you
called
this
flower
by
its
right
name
of
let
us
do
so
said
martin
readily
and
then
the
nonsense
will
run
this
way
as
easily
as
that
hide
in
the
hedge
jack
hide
in
the
hedge
you
might
catch
a
letter
dropped
over
the
edge
if
you
catch
her
letter
slip
it
in
my
hand
and
i
write
another
that
she
understand
as
he
concluded
gillian
lifted
up
her
head
and
putting
her
hair
from
her
face
gazed
over
the
duckpond
beyond
the
green
wicket
the
lady
said
joscelyn
with
some
impatience
who
understand
the
letter
must
outdo
me
in
wits
for
i
find
no
understanding
whatever
in
your
silly
song
however
it
seems
to
have
brought
our
daughter
out
of
her
lethargy
and
the
moment
is
favorable
to
your
tale
therefore
without
further
ado
i
beg
you
to
begin
i
will
said
martin
and
on
my
part
entreat
your
forbearance
while
i
relate
to
you
the
story
of
the
king
barn
the
king
barn
there
was
once
dear
maidens
a
king
in
sussex
of
whose
kingdom
and
possessions
nothing
remained
but
a
single
barn
and
a
change
of
linen
it
was
no
fault
of
his
he
was
a
very
young
king
when
he
came
into
his
heritage
and
it
was
already
dwindled
to
these
proportions
once
his
fathers
had
owned
a
beautiful
city
on
the
banks
of
the
adur
and
all
the
lands
to
the
north
and
the
west
were
theirs
for
a
matter
of
several
miles
indeed
including
many
strange
things
that
were
on
them
such
as
the
wapping
thorp
the
huddle
stone
the
bush
hovel
where
a
wise
woman
lived
and
the
guess
gate
likewise
those
two
communities
known
as
the
doves
and
the
hawking
sopers
whose
ways
of
life
were
as
opposite
as
the
poles
the
doves
were
simple
men
and
religious
but
the
hawking
sopers
were
indeed
a
wild
and
rowdy
crew
and
it
is
said
that
the
king
father
had
hunted
and
drunk
with
them
until
his
estates
were
gambled
away
and
his
affairs
decayed
of
neglect
and
nothing
was
left
at
last
but
the
solitary
barn
which
marked
the
northern
boundary
of
his
possessions
and
here
when
his
father
was
dead
our
young
king
sat
on
a
tussock
of
hay
with
his
golden
crown
on
his
head
and
his
golden
scepter
in
his
hand
and
ate
bread
and
cheese
thrice
a
day
throwing
the
rind
to
the
rats
and
the
crumbs
to
the
swallows
his
name
was
william
and
beyond
the
rats
and
the
swallows
he
had
no
other
company
than
a
nag
called
pepper
whom
he
fed
daily
from
the
tussock
he
sat
on
but
at
the
end
of
a
week
he
said
it
is
a
dull
life
what
should
a
king
do
in
a
barn
so
saying
he
pulled
the
last
handful
of
hay
from
under
him
rising
up
quickly
before
he
had
time
to
fall
down
and
gave
it
to
his
nag
and
next
he
tied
up
his
scepter
and
crown
with
his
change
of
linen
in
a
blue
handkerchief
and
last
he
fetched
a
rope
and
a
sack
and
put
them
on
pepper
for
bridle
and
saddle
and
rode
out
of
the
barn
leaving
the
door
to
swing
let
us
go
south
pepper
said
he
for
it
is
warmer
to
ride
into
the
sun
than
away
from
it
and
so
we
shall
visit
my
father
lands
that
might
have
been
mine
south
they
went
with
the
great
downs
ahead
of
them
and
who
knew
what
beyond
and
first
they
came
to
the
hawking
sopers
who
when
they
saw
william
approaching
tumbled
out
of
their
dwelling
with
a
great
racket
crying
to
him
to
come
and
drink
and
play
with
them
not
i
said
he
for
so
i
should
lose
my
barn
to
you
and
such
as
it
is
it
is
a
shelter
and
my
only
one
but
tell
me
if
you
can
what
should
a
king
do
in
a
barn
he
should
dance
in
it
said
they
and
went
laughing
and
singing
back
to
their
cups
what
sort
of
advice
is
this
pepper
said
the
king
shall
we
try
elsewhere
the
nag
whinnied
with
unusual
vehemence
and
the
king
taking
this
for
yea
and
not
observing
that
she
limped
as
she
went
rode
on
to
the
doves
the
gentle
brothers
who
spent
their
days
in
pious
works
and
their
nights
in
meditation
between
the
twelve
hours
of
twilight
and
dawn
they
were
pledged
not
to
utter
speech
but
the
king
arriving
there
at
noon
they
welcomed
him
with
kind
words
and
offered
him
a
bowl
of
rice
and
milk
he
thanked
them
and
when
he
had
eaten
and
drink
put
to
them
his
riddle
what
should
a
king
do
in
a
barn
they
answered
he
should
pray
in
it
this
may
be
good
advice
said
the
king
pepper
should
we
go
further
the
little
nag
whinnied
till
her
sides
shook
which
the
king
took
as
before
to
be
an
affirmative
however
because
it
was
sunday
he
remained
with
the
doves
a
day
and
a
night
and
during
such
time
as
their
lips
were
not
sealed
they
urged
him
to
become
one
of
them
and
found
a
new
settlement
of
brothers
in
his
barn
he
spent
his
night
in
reflection
but
by
morning
had
come
to
no
decision
to
what
better
use
could
you
dedicate
it
asked
the
chief
brother
who
was
known
as
the
ringdove
because
he
was
the
leader
none
that
i
can
think
of
said
the
king
but
i
fear
i
am
not
good
enough
when
you
have
passed
our
initiation
said
the
ringdove
you
will
be
is
it
difficult
asked
william
no
it
is
very
easy
and
can
be
accomplished
within
a
month
you
have
only
to
ride
south
till
you
come
to
the
hills
on
the
highest
of
which
you
will
see
a
ring
of
under
the
hills
lies
the
little
village
of
washington
and
there
you
may
dwell
in
comfort
through
the
week
but
on
each
of
the
four
saturdays
of
the
lunar
month
you
must
mount
the
hill
at
sunset
and
keep
a
vigil
among
the
beeches
till
sunrise
and
you
must
see
that
these
saturdays
occur
on
the
fourth
quarters
of
the
moon
once
when
she
is
in
her
crescent
once
at
the
half
again
at
the
full
and
lastly
when
she
is
waning
and
is
this
all
said
william
it
sounds
very
simple
not
quite
all
but
the
rest
is
nearly
as
simple
you
have
but
to
observe
four
rules
first
to
tell
no
living
soul
of
your
resolve
during
the
month
of
initiation
second
to
keep
your
vigil
always
between
the
two
great
beeches
in
the
middle
of
the
ring
third
to
issue
forth
at
midnight
and
immerse
your
head
in
the
dewpond
which
lies
on
the
hilltop
to
the
west
and
having
done
so
to
return
to
your
watch
between
the
trees
and
fourth
to
make
no
utterance
on
any
account
whatever
from
sunset
to
sunrise
suppose
i
should
sneeze
inquired
the
king
anxiously
there
no
supposing
about
it
said
the
ringdove
sneezing
seeing
that
your
head
will
be
extremely
wet
is
practically
inevitable
but
the
rule
applies
only
to
such
utterance
as
lies
within
human
control
when
the
fourth
vigil
has
been
successfully
accomplished
return
to
us
for
a
blessing
and
the
gray
robe
of
our
order
but
how
asked
the
king
during
my
vigils
shall
i
know
when
midnight
is
due
in
the
third
quarter
after
eleven
a
bird
sings
at
the
beginning
of
its
song
go
forth
from
the
ring
and
at
the
ending
plunge
your
head
into
the
pond
for
on
these
nights
the
bird
sings
ceaselessly
for
fifteen
minutes
but
stops
at
the
very
moment
of
midnight
and
is
this
really
all
this
is
all
how
easy
it
is
to
become
good
said
william
cheerfully
i
will
begin
at
once
so
impatient
was
he
to
become
a
brother
dove
but
here
martin
pippin
broke
off
abruptly
and
catching
the
rope
of
the
swing
in
his
left
hand
he
gave
it
a
great
lurch
joan
oh
oh
oh
martin
i
perceive
mistress
joan
that
you
lose
interest
in
my
story
your
mouth
droops
joan
oh
no
oh
no
it
is
only
it
is
a
very
nice
story
but
martin
what
can
not
be
said
aloud
can
frequently
be
whispered
he
leaned
his
ear
close
to
her
mouth
and
very
shyly
she
whispered
into
it
joan
whispering
very
shyly
why
must
the
young
king
join
a
brotherhood
i
thought
this
was
to
be
a
love
story
martin
smiled
and
chose
an
apple
from
her
lap
keep
this
for
me
said
he
until
i
ask
for
it
and
if
you
are
not
then
satisfied
neither
will
i
be
so
impatient
resumed
martin
was
the
king
to
enter
the
brotherhood
that
he
abandoned
his
idea
of
visiting
the
huddle
stone
and
the
wapping
thorp
which
would
have
taken
him
out
of
his
course
and
without
even
waiting
to
break
his
fast
leaped
on
to
pepper
back
and
turned
her
head
southwest
towards
the
hills
and
in
his
eagerness
he
failed
to
remark
how
pepper
stumbled
at
every
second
step
before
he
had
gone
a
mile
he
came
to
the
guess
gate
of
the
guess
gate
as
you
may
know
all
men
ask
a
question
in
passing
through
and
in
the
of
the
gate
it
creaks
an
answer
so
nothing
more
natural
than
that
the
king
having
flung
the
gate
open
should
cry
aloud
once
more
gate
gate
what
should
a
king
do
in
a
barn
now
at
last
thought
he
i
shall
be
told
whether
to
dance
or
to
pray
in
it
and
he
stood
listening
eagerly
as
the
gate
hung
an
instant
on
its
outward
journey
and
then
began
to
creak
home
he
should
rule
in
it
he
should
rule
in
it
he
should
squeaked
the
guess
gate
and
then
latch
clicked
and
it
was
silent
this
disconcerted
william
now
i
am
worse
off
than
ever
he
sighed
pray
pepper
can
this
advice
be
bettered
as
usual
when
he
questioned
her
the
nag
pricked
up
her
ears
and
whinnied
so
violently
that
he
nearly
fell
off
her
back
nevertheless
he
kept
pepper
head
in
a
beeline
for
chanctonbury
never
noticing
how
very
ill
she
was
going
and
presently
crossed
the
great
high
road
beyond
which
lay
the
bush
hovel
the
wise
woman
was
at
home
from
afar
the
king
saw
her
sitting
outside
the
hovel
mending
her
broom
with
a
withe
from
the
bush
here
if
anywhere
rejoiced
william
i
shall
learn
the
truth
he
dismounted
and
approached
the
old
woman
cap
in
hand
wise
woman
he
said
respectfully
you
know
most
things
but
do
you
know
this
whether
a
king
should
dance
or
pray
or
rule
in
his
barn
he
should
do
all
three
young
man
said
the
wise
woman
but
exclaimed
william
i
busy
snapped
the
wise
woman
you
men
will
always
be
chattering
as
though
pots
need
never
be
stewed
nor
cobwebs
swept
so
saying
she
went
into
the
hovel
and
slammed
the
door
pepper
said
the
poor
king
i
am
at
my
wits
ends
go
where
yours
lead
you
at
this
pepper
whinnied
in
a
perfect
frenzy
of
delight
and
the
king
had
to
clasp
both
arms
round
her
neck
to
avoid
tumbling
off
now
the
little
nag
preferred
roads
to
beelines
over
copses
and
ditches
and
she
turned
back
and
ambled
along
the
highway
so
very
lamely
that
it
became
impossible
even
for
her
preoccupied
rider
not
to
perceive
that
she
had
cast
all
her
four
shoes
poor
beast
he
cried
dismayed
how
has
this
happened
and
where
oh
pepper
how
could
you
be
so
careless
i
have
not
a
penny
in
my
purse
to
buy
you
new
shoes
my
poor
pepper
do
you
not
remember
where
you
lost
them
the
little
nag
licked
her
master
hand
for
he
had
dismounted
to
examine
her
trouble
and
looked
at
him
with
great
eyes
full
of
affection
and
then
she
flung
up
her
head
and
whinnied
louder
than
ever
the
sound
of
it
was
like
nothing
so
much
as
laughter
then
she
went
on
hobbling
as
best
she
could
and
the
king
walked
by
her
side
with
his
hand
on
her
neck
in
this
way
they
came
to
a
small
village
and
here
the
nag
turned
up
a
and
halted
outside
the
blacksmith
forge
the
smith
lad
stood
within
clinking
at
the
anvil
the
smuttiest
lad
smith
ever
had
lad
cried
the
king
the
lad
looked
up
from
his
work
and
came
at
once
to
the
door
wiping
his
hands
upon
his
leather
apron
where
am
i
asked
the
king
in
the
village
of
washington
said
the
lad
what
under
the
ring
cried
the
king
yes
sir
said
the
lad
a
blessing
on
you
said
the
king
joyfully
and
clapped
his
hand
on
the
lad
shoulder
pepper
you
have
solved
the
problem
and
led
me
to
my
destiny
is
pepper
your
nag
name
asked
the
blacksmith
lad
it
is
said
the
king
her
only
one
then
she
has
one
more
name
than
she
has
shoes
said
the
lad
how
came
she
to
lose
them
i
did
notice
confessed
the
king
you
must
have
been
thinking
very
deeply
remarked
the
lad
are
you
in
love
i
am
not
quite
said
the
king
i
see
do
you
want
your
nag
shod
i
do
but
i
have
spent
my
last
penny
earn
another
then
said
the
lad
i
did
not
even
earn
the
last
one
said
the
king
shamefacedly
i
have
never
worked
in
my
life
why
where
have
you
lived
exclaimed
the
lad
in
a
barn
but
one
works
in
a
barn
stop
cried
the
king
putting
his
fingers
in
his
ears
one
prays
in
a
barn
very
likely
said
the
lad
looking
at
him
curiously
are
you
going
to
pray
in
one
yes
said
the
king
when
is
the
new
moon
next
saturday
hurrah
cried
the
king
that
settles
it
but
what
monday
sir
alas
sighed
william
wondering
how
he
should
make
shift
to
live
for
five
days
i
do
know
what
you
mean
sir
said
the
lad
i
would
tell
you
my
meaning
said
the
king
but
am
pledged
not
to
then
the
lad
said
let
it
pass
i
have
a
proposal
to
make
my
father
is
dead
and
for
two
years
i
have
worked
the
forge
now
i
am
willing
to
teach
you
to
shoe
your
nag
with
four
good
shoes
and
strong
if
you
will
meanwhile
blow
the
bellows
for
whatever
other
jobs
come
to
the
forge
and
if
the
shoes
are
not
done
by
you
shall
have
a
meal
thrown
in
the
king
looked
at
the
lad
kindly
i
shall
blow
your
bellows
very
badly
he
said
and
shoe
my
nag
still
worse
said
the
lad
you
learn
in
time
not
before
i
hope
said
the
king
for
i
am
very
hungry
you
look
hungry
said
the
lad
it
a
bargain
then
the
king
held
out
his
hand
but
the
lad
suddenly
whipped
his
behind
his
back
it
so
dirty
sir
he
said
give
it
me
all
the
same
said
the
king
and
they
clasped
hands
the
rest
of
that
morning
the
king
spent
in
blowing
the
bellows
and
by
not
so
much
as
the
first
of
pepper
hoofs
was
shod
for
a
great
deal
of
business
came
into
the
forge
and
there
was
no
time
for
a
lesson
so
the
king
and
the
lad
took
their
meal
together
and
the
king
was
by
this
time
nearly
as
black
as
his
master
he
would
have
washed
himself
but
the
lad
said
it
was
no
matter
he
himself
having
no
time
to
wash
from
week
end
to
week
end
in
the
afternoon
they
changed
places
and
the
king
stood
at
the
anvil
and
the
lad
at
the
bellows
he
was
a
good
teacher
but
the
king
made
a
poor
job
of
it
by
nightfall
he
had
produced
shoes
resembling
all
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
excepting
u
and
when
at
last
he
submitted
to
the
lad
a
shoe
like
nothing
so
much
as
a
drunken
s
his
master
shrugged
and
said
zeal
is
praiseworthy
within
its
limits
but
the
best
of
smiths
does
not
attempt
to
make
two
shoes
at
once
let
us
sup
they
supped
and
afterwards
the
lad
showed
the
king
a
small
bedroom
as
neat
as
a
new
pin
i
shall
sully
the
sheets
said
william
and
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
fetch
the
kettle
which
is
on
the
boil
as
you
please
said
the
lad
and
took
himself
off
in
the
morning
the
king
came
clean
to
breakfast
but
the
lad
was
as
black
as
he
had
been
tuesday
passed
as
monday
had
passed
now
william
took
the
bellows
marveling
at
his
youthful
master
deftness
and
now
the
lad
blew
groaning
at
his
pupil
clumsiness
by
nightfall
however
he
had
achieved
a
shoe
faintly
recognizable
as
such
for
a
second
time
the
king
washed
himself
and
slept
again
in
the
little
trim
chamber
but
the
lad
in
the
morning
resembled
midnight
in
this
way
the
week
went
by
the
king
heart
beating
a
little
faster
each
morning
as
saturday
approached
and
he
wondered
by
what
ruse
he
could
explain
his
absence
without
creating
suspicion
or
breaking
his
pledge
on
saturday
morning
the
lad
said
to
the
king
this
is
a
you
must
make
your
shoe
this
morning
or
not
at
all
it
is
my
custom
at
one
to
close
the
forge
and
go
to
visit
my
i
will
be
work
again
on
monday
till
when
you
must
shift
for
yourself
the
king
could
hardly
believe
his
luck
in
having
matters
so
well
settled
and
he
spent
the
morning
so
diligently
that
by
noon
he
had
produced
a
shoe
which
if
not
that
of
a
was
at
least
adaptable
to
the
purpose
for
which
it
had
been
fashioned
the
lad
examined
it
and
said
reluctantly
it
will
do
and
proceeded
to
show
the
king
how
to
fasten
it
to
pepper
hoof
why
said
the
king
having
the
nag
off
forefoot
in
his
hand
here
a
stone
in
it
small
wonder
she
limped
it
is
a
stone
said
the
lad
extracting
it
it
is
a
ruby
and
he
exhibited
to
the
king
a
ruby
of
such
a
glowing
red
that
it
was
as
though
the
souls
of
all
the
grapes
of
burgundy
had
been
pressed
to
create
it
you
are
a
rich
man
now
said
the
lad
quietly
and
can
live
as
you
will
but
william
closed
the
lad
fingers
over
the
stone
keep
it
he
said
for
you
have
filled
me
for
a
week
and
i
have
paid
you
with
nothing
but
my
breath
as
you
please
said
the
lad
carelessly
and
tossing
the
stone
upon
a
shelf
locked
up
the
forge
now
i
am
going
to
my
there
a
cake
in
the
larder
so
saying
he
strolled
away
and
the
king
was
left
to
his
own
devices
these
consisted
in
bathing
himself
from
head
to
foot
till
his
body
was
as
pure
without
as
he
desired
his
heart
to
be
within
and
in
donning
his
fresh
suit
of
linen
he
would
not
break
his
fast
but
waited
trembling
and
eager
till
an
hour
before
sundown
and
then
at
last
he
set
forth
to
mount
the
great
hill
with
the
sacred
crown
of
trees
upon
its
crest
when
at
last
he
stood
upon
the
boundary
of
the
ring
his
heart
sprang
for
joy
in
his
breast
and
his
breath
nearly
failed
him
with
amazement
at
the
beauty
of
the
world
which
lay
outspread
for
leagues
below
him
oh
lovely
earth
he
cried
aloud
never
till
now
have
i
known
what
beauty
i
lived
in
how
is
it
that
we
can
not
see
the
wonder
of
our
surroundings
until
we
gaze
upon
them
from
afar
but
if
you
look
so
fair
from
the
hilltops
what
must
you
appear
from
the
very
sky
and
lost
in
delight
he
turned
his
eyes
upward
and
was
recalled
to
his
senses
by
the
sight
of
the
sinking
sun
lovely
one
how
nearly
you
have
betrayed
me
he
said
and
smiling
waved
his
hand
to
the
dear
earth
sealed
up
his
lips
and
entered
the
ring
and
here
between
two
midmost
beeches
he
knelt
down
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
prayed
the
spirits
of
that
place
to
make
him
worthy
the
hours
passed
quarter
by
quarter
and
the
king
stayed
motionless
like
one
in
a
dream
presently
however
the
dream
was
faintly
shaken
by
a
little
lirrup
of
sound
as
light
as
rain
dropping
from
leaves
above
a
pool
again
and
again
the
sweet
round
notes
fell
on
the
meditations
of
the
king
and
he
remembered
with
entrancement
that
this
was
the
tender
signal
by
which
he
was
summoned
to
the
pond
so
rising
silently
he
wandered
through
the
trees
and
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
soft
dim
turf
lest
some
new
beauty
should
tempt
him
to
speech
he
went
across
the
open
hill
the
pond
here
he
knelt
down
again
listening
to
the
childlike
bird
until
at
last
the
young
piping
ceased
with
a
joyous
chuckle
and
at
that
instant
reflected
in
the
pond
he
saw
the
silver
star
that
watches
the
invisible
young
moon
and
dipped
his
head
oh
my
dear
maids
when
he
lifted
it
again
all
wet
and
bewildered
he
saw
upon
the
opposite
border
of
the
pond
a
figure
the
white
figure
of
a
woman
a
girl
a
child
he
could
not
tell
for
she
lay
three
parts
in
the
shadowy
water
with
her
back
towards
him
and
his
gaze
and
senses
swam
but
in
that
faint
starlight
one
bare
and
lovely
arm
as
white
as
the
crescent
moon
was
clear
to
him
upcurved
to
her
shadowy
hair
so
she
reclined
and
so
he
knelt
both
motionless
and
his
heart
trembled
even
as
it
had
trembled
at
the
bird
song
with
a
wish
to
go
near
to
her
or
at
least
to
whisper
to
her
across
the
water
indeed
he
was
on
the
point
of
doing
so
when
a
sudden
contraction
seized
him
his
eyes
closed
in
a
delicious
agony
and
he
sneezed
once
vigorously
and
in
that
moment
of
shattering
blackness
he
recalled
his
vow
and
rising
turned
his
back
upon
the
vision
and
groped
his
way
again
to
the
shelter
of
the
trees
here
he
remained
till
dawn
in
meditation
but
as
to
the
nature
of
his
meditations
i
am
dear
maidens
ignorant
nor
do
i
know
in
what
restless
wise
he
passed
his
sunday
it
is
enough
to
know
that
on
monday
when
he
went
into
the
forge
he
found
the
lad
already
at
work
and
if
he
had
been
at
their
parting
he
was
no
less
so
at
their
meeting
he
appeared
to
be
out
of
humor
and
for
some
time
regarded
his
apprentice
with
dissatisfaction
but
only
remarked
at
last
you
look
fatigued
my
sleep
was
broken
with
dreams
said
the
king
i
am
sorry
if
i
am
late
let
me
to
my
shoeing
since
saturday
ended
in
success
i
suppose
i
shall
now
finish
the
business
without
more
ado
he
was
however
too
hopeful
as
it
appeared
for
though
he
managed
to
fashion
a
shoe
which
was
in
his
eyes
the
equal
of
the
other
the
lad
was
captious
and
would
not
commend
it
i
should
be
an
ill
craftmaster
said
he
if
i
let
you
rest
content
on
what
you
have
already
done
i
made
such
a
shoe
as
this
on
my
thirteenth
birthday
and
my
father
only
praise
was
you
must
do
better
yet
so
particular
was
the
young
smith
that
william
spent
the
whole
of
another
week
in
endeavoring
to
please
him
this
might
have
chafed
the
king
but
that
it
agreed
entirely
with
his
desires
to
remain
in
that
place
sleeping
and
eating
at
no
cost
to
himself
and
working
so
strenuously
that
his
hands
grew
almost
as
hard
as
the
metal
he
worked
in
for
the
lad
now
began
to
entrust
him
with
small
jobs
of
various
sorts
although
in
the
matter
of
the
second
shoe
he
refused
to
be
satisfied
when
saturday
came
however
the
king
contrived
a
shoe
so
much
superior
to
any
he
had
yet
made
that
the
lad
examining
it
was
compelled
to
say
it
is
better
than
the
other
then
pepper
who
always
stood
in
a
noose
beside
the
door
awaiting
her
moment
lifted
up
her
near
forefoot
of
her
own
accord
and
the
king
took
it
in
his
hand
how
odd
he
exclaimed
a
moment
later
the
nag
has
a
stone
in
this
foot
also
it
is
not
strange
that
she
went
so
it
is
not
a
stone
said
the
lad
it
is
a
pearl
and
he
held
out
to
the
king
a
pearl
of
such
a
shining
purity
that
it
was
as
though
it
had
been
rounded
within
the
spirit
of
a
saint
this
makes
you
a
rich
man
said
the
lad
moodily
and
you
can
journey
whither
you
please
but
the
king
shook
his
head
keep
it
he
said
for
you
have
lodged
me
for
a
week
and
i
have
given
you
only
the
clumsy
service
of
my
hands
very
well
said
the
lad
simply
and
put
the
pearl
in
his
pocket
my
is
expecting
me
there
a
cake
in
the
larder
so
saying
he
walked
off
and
the
king
was
left
alone
as
before
he
bathed
himself
and
changed
his
linen
and
left
the
contents
of
the
larder
untouched
and
an
hour
before
sunset
he
climbed
the
hill
for
the
second
time
and
presently
stood
panting
on
the
edge
of
the
ring
and
again
a
pang
of
wonder
that
was
akin
to
pain
shot
through
his
heart
at
the
loveliness
of
the
world
below
him
beautiful
earth
he
cried
once
more
how
fair
and
dear
you
are
become
to
me
in
your
remoteness
but
oh
if
you
appear
so
beautiful
from
this
summit
what
must
you
appear
from
the
summit
of
the
clouds
and
he
glanced
from
the
earth
to
the
sky
and
saw
the
sun
running
down
his
airy
hill
dear
temptress
he
said
how
cunningly
you
would
snare
me
from
my
purpose
and
he
kissed
his
hand
to
her
thrice
sealed
up
his
lips
and
entered
the
ring
between
the
two
tall
beeches
he
knelt
down
and
drowned
the
following
hours
in
thought
and
prayer
till
that
deep
lake
of
meditation
was
divided
by
the
sound
of
singing
as
though
a
shoal
of
silver
fishes
swam
and
leaped
upon
its
surface
putting
all
quietness
to
flight
and
troubling
its
waters
with
a
million
lovelinesses
for
now
it
was
as
though
the
bird
enchanting
song
came
partly
from
within
and
partly
from
without
and
if
the
fall
of
its
music
shattered
his
dream
like
falling
fish
certain
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
fish
had
first
leaped
from
his
own
heart
out
of
whose
unsuspected
caves
darted
a
shoal
of
nameless
longings
he
too
leaped
up
and
darted
through
the
trees
and
with
head
bent
down
for
fear
of
he
knew
not
what
made
his
way
to
the
pond
here
he
knelt
again
drinking
in
the
tremulous
song
of
the
bird
as
tremulous
as
youth
and
maidenhood
until
at
last
it
ceased
with
a
sweet
uncompleted
cry
of
longing
and
at
that
instant
in
the
mirror
of
the
pond
he
saw
the
uncompleted
disc
of
the
and
dipped
his
head
ah
wonder
when
he
lifted
it
again
dazzled
and
dripping
he
saw
across
the
pond
a
figure
rising
from
the
water
the
figure
as
he
could
now
perceive
in
the
fuller
light
of
a
girl
clear
to
the
waist
her
face
was
half
turned
from
him
and
her
hair
flowed
half
to
him
and
half
away
but
within
that
cloudy
setting
gleamed
the
lines
of
her
lovely
neck
and
one
white
shoulder
and
one
moonlit
breast
whose
undercurve
appeared
to
float
upon
the
pond
like
the
petal
of
a
waterlily
so
he
knelt
on
his
side
and
she
on
hers
both
motionless
and
he
heart
leaped
even
as
it
had
leaped
at
the
bird
song
with
a
longing
to
kneel
beside
and
even
touch
that
loveliness
or
if
he
could
not
at
least
to
call
to
her
across
the
pond
so
that
he
would
turn
and
reveal
to
him
what
still
was
hidden
he
was
in
fact
about
to
do
so
when
suddenly
his
senses
were
overwhelmed
with
a
sweet
anguish
darkness
fell
on
him
and
from
its
very
core
he
sneezed
twice
violently
this
interruption
of
the
previous
spell
was
sufficient
to
bring
him
to
a
realization
of
his
peril
and
rising
hastily
he
ran
back
to
the
ring
where
he
remained
till
morning
but
to
what
pious
thoughts
he
then
committed
himself
i
can
not
tell
you
neither
in
what
feverish
fashion
he
got
through
sunday
on
monday
morning
when
he
arrived
at
the
forge
he
found
the
lad
at
work
before
him
and
ebony
was
not
blacker
than
his
face
he
glanced
at
the
king
with
some
show
of
temper
but
only
said
you
look
worn
out
i
have
had
bad
dreams
said
the
king
excuse
me
for
being
behind
my
time
i
will
try
to
make
up
for
it
by
wasting
no
more
and
fashioning
instantly
two
shoes
as
good
as
that
i
made
on
saturday
but
though
he
handled
his
tools
with
more
dexterity
than
he
had
yet
exhibited
the
lad
petulantly
pushed
aside
the
first
shoe
he
made
which
to
the
king
appeared
to
be
if
anything
superior
to
the
one
he
had
made
on
saturday
the
lad
however
quickly
explained
himself
saying
a
who
intends
to
make
his
apprentice
his
equal
will
not
let
him
rest
at
the
halfway
house
i
made
a
shoe
like
this
when
i
was
fourteen
and
all
my
father
said
was
i
have
hopes
of
you
so
for
yet
another
week
the
king
nose
was
kept
to
the
grindstone
and
it
would
have
irritated
most
men
to
find
their
good
work
repeatedly
condemned
but
william
was
as
you
may
have
observed
singularly
besides
which
he
desired
nothing
so
much
as
to
remain
where
he
was
and
for
another
five
days
he
slept
and
ate
and
worked
until
the
muscles
of
his
arms
began
to
swell
and
he
swung
the
hammer
with
as
much
ease
as
his
master
who
now
left
a
great
part
of
the
work
entirely
in
his
hands
although
in
this
matter
of
the
third
shoe
he
refused
to
be
satisfied
nevertheless
on
saturday
morning
the
king
making
a
last
effort
before
the
forge
was
shut
submitted
a
shoe
so
far
beyond
anything
he
had
yet
achieved
that
the
lad
could
not
but
say
this
is
a
good
shoe
and
pepper
seeing
them
coming
lifted
her
off
to
be
shod
now
as
i
live
cried
the
king
another
stone
and
how
she
contrived
to
hobble
so
far
is
a
miracle
it
is
a
stone
said
the
lad
it
is
a
diamond
and
he
presented
to
the
king
a
diamond
of
such
triumphant
brilliance
that
it
might
have
been
conceived
of
the
ambitions
of
the
mightiest
monarch
of
the
earth
you
now
own
surpassing
wealth
said
the
lad
dejectedly
and
you
have
no
more
need
to
work
but
william
would
not
even
touch
the
stone
keep
it
he
said
for
you
have
befriended
me
for
a
week
and
i
have
given
you
only
the
strength
of
my
arms
let
it
be
so
said
the
lad
gently
and
put
the
diamond
in
his
belt
i
must
not
keep
my
waiting
there
a
cake
in
the
larder
so
saying
he
went
his
way
and
the
king
went
his
which
as
you
may
surmise
was
to
the
bath
and
his
clean
clothes
he
did
not
go
into
the
larder
and
an
hour
before
sunset
made
the
ascent
of
the
hill
and
for
the
third
time
stood
like
a
conqueror
upon
the
crest
and
as
he
gazed
over
the
lands
below
his
heart
throbbed
with
a
passion
for
the
earth
that
was
half
agony
and
half
love
unless
indeed
it
was
the
whole
agony
of
love
most
beautiful
earth
he
cried
aloud
only
as
you
recede
from
me
do
i
realize
how
necessary
it
is
for
me
to
possess
you
how
is
it
that
when
i
possess
you
i
know
you
not
as
i
know
you
now
but
oh
if
you
are
so
wonderful
from
these
great
hills
what
must
you
be
from
the
greater
hills
of
air
and
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
sun
descending
in
the
west
sweet
earth
he
sighed
you
would
hold
me
when
i
should
be
gone
and
never
remind
me
that
the
moment
to
depart
is
due
and
he
stretched
out
his
arms
to
her
sealed
up
his
lips
and
went
into
the
ring
once
more
he
knelt
between
the
giant
beeches
and
sank
all
thoughts
in
pious
contemplation
till
suddenly
those
still
waters
were
convulsed
as
though
with
stormy
currents
and
a
wild
song
beat
through
his
breast
so
that
he
could
not
believe
it
was
the
bird
singing
from
a
short
distance
it
was
as
though
the
storm
of
music
broke
from
his
singing
heart
yes
from
his
own
heart
singing
for
some
unexpressed
fulfillment
he
was
barely
conscious
of
going
through
the
trees
with
eyes
shut
tight
against
the
outer
world
but
soon
he
was
kneeling
at
the
brink
of
the
pond
while
the
surge
of
joy
and
pain
in
the
song
broke
on
his
spirit
like
waves
upon
a
shore
or
love
upon
a
man
and
a
woman
washed
back
towered
up
and
broke
on
him
again
at
last
on
one
full
glorious
phrase
it
ceased
and
at
that
instant
deep
in
the
pond
he
saw
the
full
orb
of
the
moon
and
dipped
his
head
oh
when
he
lifted
it
startled
and
illuminated
he
saw
on
the
further
side
of
the
pond
a
woman
standing
the
moonlight
bathed
her
form
from
head
to
foot
her
hair
was
thrown
behind
her
and
she
stood
facing
him
so
that
in
the
cold
clear
light
he
could
see
her
fully
revealed
her
strong
tender
face
her
strong
soft
body
her
strong
slim
legs
her
strong
and
lovely
arms
as
white
as
mayblossom
she
was
and
beauty
went
forth
from
her
like
fragrance
from
the
shaken
bough
so
he
knelt
on
his
side
and
she
stood
on
hers
both
motionless
but
gazing
into
each
other
eyes
and
his
heart
broke
even
as
it
had
broken
at
the
song
with
a
passion
to
take
her
in
his
arms
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
alone
would
mend
its
breaking
or
if
he
might
not
do
this
at
least
to
send
his
need
of
her
in
a
great
cry
across
the
pond
and
as
his
passion
grew
she
slowly
lifted
her
arms
and
opened
them
to
him
as
though
to
bid
him
enter
and
her
lips
parted
and
she
cried
out
as
though
she
were
uttering
the
cry
of
his
own
soul
beloved
all
the
joy
and
the
pain
fulfilled
of
the
bird
song
were
gathered
in
that
word
glorified
he
leaped
up
his
whole
being
answering
the
cry
of
hers
but
before
his
lips
could
translate
it
he
was
gripped
by
a
mighty
agony
and
sneeze
after
sneeze
shook
all
his
senses
so
that
he
was
utterly
helpless
when
he
was
able
to
look
up
again
he
saw
the
woman
moving
towards
him
round
the
pond
and
suddenly
he
clapped
his
hands
over
his
eyes
and
fled
towards
the
ring
as
though
pursued
by
demons
here
he
passed
the
remainder
of
the
night
but
in
what
sort
of
prayers
i
leave
you
to
imagine
as
also
amid
what
ravings
he
passed
his
sunday
on
monday
the
lad
was
again
before
him
at
the
forge
and
a
crow
wing
had
looked
milky
beside
his
face
he
did
not
raise
his
eyes
as
the
king
came
in
but
said
you
look
very
he
said
it
furiously
i
have
had
nightmares
said
the
king
pardon
me
if
you
can
i
will
get
to
work
and
make
my
final
shoe
but
though
he
now
had
little
more
to
learn
in
his
craft
the
lad
when
the
shoe
was
made
picked
it
up
in
his
pincers
and
flung
it
to
the
other
end
of
the
forge
yet
the
king
now
knew
enough
to
know
that
few
smiths
could
have
made
its
equal
so
he
looked
surprised
at
which
the
lad
controlling
himself
said
when
i
pass
your
fourth
shoe
you
will
need
no
more
masters
i
forged
a
shoe
like
that
one
yonder
when
i
was
fifteen
and
my
father
said
of
it
you
will
make
a
smith
one
day
and
on
neither
tuesday
nor
wednesday
nor
thursday
nor
friday
could
the
king
succeed
in
pleasing
the
lad
the
better
his
shoes
the
angrier
grew
his
young
master
that
they
were
not
good
enough
yet
between
these
gusts
of
temper
he
was
gentle
and
remorseful
and
once
the
king
saw
tears
in
his
eyes
and
another
time
the
lad
came
humbly
to
ask
for
pardon
then
william
laughed
and
put
out
his
hand
but
as
once
before
the
lad
slipped
his
behind
his
back
and
said
it
is
so
dirty
friend
and
this
time
he
would
not
let
william
take
it
so
the
king
was
forced
instead
to
lay
his
arm
about
the
lad
shoulder
and
press
it
tenderly
but
the
lad
made
no
response
and
only
stood
hanging
his
head
until
the
king
removed
his
arm
all
the
same
when
next
the
king
made
a
shoe
he
was
full
of
rage
and
stamped
on
it
and
ran
out
of
the
forge
which
surprised
the
king
all
the
more
because
it
was
so
excellent
a
shoe
yet
he
was
secretly
glad
of
its
rejection
for
he
felt
it
would
break
his
heart
to
go
away
from
that
place
and
he
could
think
of
no
good
cause
for
remaining
once
pepper
was
shod
so
there
he
stayed
eating
sleeping
and
working
while
the
thews
of
his
back
became
as
strong
under
the
smooth
skin
as
the
thews
of
a
under
the
smooth
bark
and
his
craft
was
such
that
the
lad
at
last
left
the
whole
of
the
work
of
the
forge
in
his
charge
for
there
was
nothing
he
could
not
do
surpassingly
well
and
this
the
lad
admitted
save
only
in
the
case
of
the
fourth
shoe
but
on
saturday
just
before
the
king
set
to
and
made
a
shoe
so
fine
that
when
the
lad
saw
it
he
said
quietly
i
could
not
make
a
better
had
he
not
said
so
he
must
have
lied
or
proved
that
he
did
know
a
masterpiece
when
he
saw
it
and
he
too
good
a
craftsman
for
that
besides
being
honest
pepper
instantly
lifted
up
her
near
upon
my
word
exclaimed
the
king
the
world
is
full
of
stones
and
pepper
has
found
them
all
the
wonder
is
that
she
did
not
fall
down
on
the
road
this
is
not
a
stone
said
the
lad
it
is
an
opal
and
he
displayed
an
opal
of
such
marvelous
changeability
such
milk
and
fire
shot
with
such
shifting
rainbows
that
it
was
as
though
it
had
had
birth
of
all
the
moods
of
all
the
women
of
all
time
this
enriches
you
for
life
said
the
lad
gloomily
and
now
you
are
free
of
masters
for
ever
but
william
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
keep
it
he
said
for
this
week
you
have
given
me
love
and
i
have
given
you
nothing
but
the
sinews
of
my
body
the
lad
looked
at
him
and
said
i
have
given
you
hard
words
and
fits
of
temper
and
much
injustice
have
you
said
william
i
remember
only
your
tenderness
and
your
tears
so
keep
the
opal
in
love
name
the
lad
tried
to
answer
but
could
not
and
he
slipped
the
opal
under
his
shirt
then
he
faltered
my
and
still
he
could
not
speak
but
he
made
a
third
effort
and
said
there
is
a
cake
in
the
larder
and
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
away
quickly
and
the
king
looked
after
him
till
he
was
out
of
sight
and
then
very
slowly
went
to
his
bath
and
his
fresh
linen
but
he
left
the
cake
where
it
was
and
he
sat
by
the
door
of
the
forge
with
his
face
in
his
hands
until
the
length
of
his
shadow
warned
him
that
he
must
go
and
he
rose
and
went
for
the
last
time
up
the
hill
but
with
a
sinking
heart
and
when
he
stood
on
the
top
and
gazed
upon
the
beauty
of
the
earth
he
had
left
below
in
his
breast
was
the
ache
of
loss
and
longing
for
one
he
had
loved
and
with
his
eyes
he
tried
to
draw
that
beauty
into
himself
but
the
void
in
him
remained
unfulfilled
yet
never
had
her
beauty
been
so
great
beloved
and
lovely
earth
he
whispered
why
do
you
appear
most
fair
and
most
desirable
now
that
i
am
about
to
lose
you
why
when
i
had
you
did
you
not
hold
me
by
force
and
tell
me
what
you
were
only
now
i
discover
you
from
but
oh
in
what
way
should
i
discover
you
from
heaven
itself
and
he
looked
upward
and
lo
a
blurred
sun
shone
upon
him
swimming
to
its
rest
farewell
dear
earth
said
the
king
since
you
can
not
mount
to
me
and
i
may
not
descend
to
you
and
he
knelt
upon
the
turf
and
laid
his
cheek
and
forehead
to
it
and
then
he
rose
sealed
up
his
lips
and
passed
into
the
ring
between
the
two
tall
beeches
he
sank
down
and
all
sense
and
thought
and
consciousness
sank
with
him
as
though
his
being
had
become
a
dead
forgotten
lake
hidden
in
a
lifeless
wood
where
birds
sang
not
nor
rain
fell
nor
fishes
played
nor
currents
moved
below
the
stagnant
waters
but
presently
a
wind
seemed
to
wail
among
the
trees
and
the
sound
of
it
traveled
over
the
king
senses
stirred
them
and
passed
but
only
to
return
again
moan
over
him
and
trail
away
and
so
it
kept
coming
and
going
till
first
he
heard
then
listened
to
and
at
last
realized
the
haunting
signal
of
the
bird
and
he
went
forth
into
the
open
night
his
eyes
wide
apart
but
seeing
nothing
until
he
stumbled
at
the
pond
and
crouched
beside
it
the
bird
grew
fainter
and
fainter
and
presently
the
sound
like
a
ghost
at
dawn
ceased
to
exist
and
at
that
instant
under
the
pond
he
beheld
the
lessening
circle
of
the
moon
and
dipped
his
head
alas
when
he
lifted
it
shivering
and
stunned
he
saw
the
form
he
longed
to
see
on
the
other
side
of
the
pond
but
not
as
he
had
longed
to
see
it
gazing
at
him
with
the
love
and
glory
of
seven
nights
ago
now
she
stood
on
the
turf
half
turned
from
him
and
the
wave
of
her
hair
blew
to
and
fro
like
a
cloud
now
revealing
her
white
side
now
concealing
it
and
he
looked
but
she
would
not
look
so
he
knelt
on
his
side
and
she
remained
on
hers
both
motionless
and
suddenly
the
impulse
to
sneeze
arose
within
him
and
at
that
instant
she
began
to
move
not
towards
him
as
before
but
away
from
him
downhill
at
that
he
could
bear
no
more
and
quelling
the
impulse
with
a
mighty
effort
he
got
upon
his
feet
crying
beloved
stay
beloved
stay
beloved
and
he
staggered
round
the
pound
as
quickly
as
his
shaking
knees
would
let
him
but
quicker
still
she
slid
away
and
when
he
came
where
she
had
been
the
place
was
as
empty
as
the
sky
in
its
moonless
season
he
called
and
ran
about
and
called
again
but
he
got
no
answer
nor
found
what
he
sought
all
that
night
he
spent
in
calling
and
running
to
and
fro
what
he
did
on
sunday
you
may
know
and
i
may
know
but
he
did
not
on
sunday
night
he
stayed
beside
the
pond
but
whatever
his
hopes
were
they
received
no
fulfillment
on
monday
night
he
was
there
again
and
on
tuesday
and
on
wednesday
and
between
the
mornings
and
the
nights
he
went
from
hill
to
hill
seeking
her
who
came
to
bathe
in
the
lake
there
was
not
a
hill
within
a
day
march
that
did
not
know
him
from
duncton
to
mount
harry
but
on
none
of
them
he
found
the
woman
how
he
lived
is
a
puzzle
perhaps
upon
wild
raspberries
after
the
sun
had
set
on
chanctonbury
on
saturday
night
he
came
exhausted
to
the
ring
again
and
stood
on
that
high
hill
gazing
earthward
but
there
was
no
light
above
or
below
and
he
said
i
have
lost
all
for
the
earth
is
swallowed
in
blackness
and
the
woman
has
disappeared
into
space
and
i
myself
have
cast
away
my
spiritual
initiation
i
will
sit
by
the
pond
till
midnight
and
if
the
bird
sings
then
i
will
still
hope
but
if
it
does
not
i
will
dip
my
head
in
the
water
and
not
lift
it
again
so
he
went
and
lay
down
by
the
pond
in
the
darkness
and
the
hours
wore
away
but
as
the
time
of
the
bird
song
drew
near
he
clasped
his
hands
and
prayed
but
the
bird
did
not
sing
and
when
he
judged
that
midnight
was
come
he
got
upon
his
knees
and
prepared
to
put
his
head
under
the
water
and
as
he
did
so
he
saw
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
pond
the
feeble
light
of
a
lantern
he
could
not
see
who
held
it
because
even
as
he
looked
the
bearer
blew
out
the
light
but
in
that
moment
it
appeared
to
him
that
she
was
as
black
as
the
night
itself
so
for
awhile
he
knelt
upon
his
side
and
she
remained
on
hers
both
trembling
but
at
last
the
king
dreading
to
startle
her
away
rose
softly
and
went
round
the
pond
to
where
he
had
seen
her
he
said
into
the
night
in
a
shaking
voice
i
can
not
see
you
if
you
are
there
give
me
your
hand
and
out
of
the
night
a
shaking
voice
replied
it
is
so
dirty
beloved
then
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
felt
how
she
trembled
and
he
held
her
closely
to
him
to
still
her
whispering
you
are
my
lad
yes
she
said
in
a
low
voice
but
wait
and
she
slipped
out
of
his
embrace
and
he
heard
her
enter
the
pond
and
she
stayed
there
as
it
seemed
to
him
a
lifetime
but
presently
she
rose
up
and
even
in
that
black
night
the
whiteness
of
her
body
was
visible
to
him
and
she
came
to
him
as
she
was
and
laid
her
head
on
his
breast
and
said
i
am
your
woman
i
want
my
apple
said
martin
pippin

this
be
the
end
but
tell
us
what
they
did
next
women
will
be
women
observed
martin
and
to
the
end
of
time
prefer
unessentials
to
the
essential
but
i
will
endeavor
to
satisfy
you
on
the
points
you
name
in
the
morning
william
said
to
his
beloved
now
tell
me
something
of
yourself
how
come
you
to
be
so
masterful
a
smith
why
do
you
live
as
a
black
lad
all
the
week
and
turn
only
into
a
white
woman
on
saturdays
have
you
really
got
a
and
where
does
she
live
how
old
are
you
why
were
you
so
hard
to
please
about
the
shoeing
of
pepper
and
why
the
better
my
shoes
the
worse
your
temper
why
did
you
run
away
from
me
a
week
ago
why
did
you
never
tell
me
who
you
were
why
have
you
tormented
me
for
a
whole
month
what
is
your
name
trust
a
man
to
ask
questions
said
his
beloved
laughing
and
blushing
is
it
not
enough
that
i
am
your
beloved
more
than
enough
yet
not
nearly
enough
said
the
king
for
there
is
nothing
of
yourself
which
you
must
not
tell
me
in
time
from
the
moment
when
you
first
stole
barley
sugar
behind
your
father
back
down
to
that
in
which
you
first
loved
me
then
i
had
best
begin
at
once
she
smiled
or
a
lifetime
will
not
be
long
enough
i
am
eighteen
years
old
and
my
name
is
viola
i
was
born
in
falmer
and
my
father
was
the
best
smith
in
all
sussex
and
because
he
had
no
other
child
he
made
me
his
and
in
time
as
you
know
taught
me
his
trade
but
he
was
as
you
also
know
a
stern
master
and
it
was
not
until
on
my
sixteenth
birthday
i
forged
a
shoe
the
equal
of
your
last
that
he
said
i
could
not
make
a
better
and
so
saying
he
died
now
i
had
no
other
relative
in
all
the
world
except
my
the
wise
woman
of
the
bush
hovel
and
her
i
had
never
seen
but
i
thought
i
could
not
do
better
in
my
extremity
than
go
to
her
for
counsel
so
shouldering
my
father
tools
i
journeyed
west
until
i
came
to
her
place
and
found
her
trying
to
break
in
a
new
that
was
still
too
green
and
full
of
sap
to
be
easily
mastered
and
she
was
in
a
very
bad
temper
good
day
i
said
i
am
your
viola
i
have
no
more
use
for
great
nieces
she
snapped
than
for
little
ones
and
she
continued
to
tussle
with
the
broomstick
and
took
no
further
notice
of
me
then
i
went
into
the
hovel
where
a
fire
burned
on
the
hearth
and
i
took
out
my
tools
and
fashioned
a
bit
on
the
hob
and
when
it
was
ready
i
took
it
to
her
and
said
this
will
teach
it
its
manners
and
she
put
the
bit
on
the
broom
which
became
as
docile
as
a
lamb
said
she
it
appears
that
i
told
you
a
lie
this
morning
what
can
i
do
for
you
tell
me
if
you
please
how
i
am
to
live
now
that
my
father
is
dead
there
is
no
need
to
tell
you
said
she
you
have
your
living
at
your
fingers
ends
but
women
can
not
be
smiths
said
i
then
become
a
lad
said
she
and
ply
your
trade
where
none
knows
you
and
lest
men
should
suspect
you
by
your
face
which
fools
though
they
be
they
might
easily
do
let
it
be
so
sooted
from
week
end
to
week
end
that
none
can
discover
what
you
look
like
and
if
any
one
remarks
on
it
put
it
down
to
your
trade
but
i
said
i
could
not
bear
to
go
dirty
from
end
to
week
end
if
you
will
be
so
particular
she
said
take
a
bath
every
saturday
night
and
spend
your
sundays
with
me
as
fair
as
when
you
were
a
babe
and
before
you
go
to
work
again
on
monday
you
shall
once
more
conceal
your
fairness
past
all
men
penetration
but
dear
i
pleaded
it
may
be
that
the
day
will
come
when
i
might
not
wish
and
here
dear
maidens
viola
faltered
and
william
put
his
arm
about
her
a
little
tighter
because
it
was
there
already
and
said
what
might
you
not
wish
beloved
and
she
murmured
to
be
concealed
past
one
man
penetration
and
my
said
i
need
not
worry
because
though
men
she
said
were
fools
there
was
one
time
in
every
life
when
he
was
quick
enough
to
penetrate
all
obscurities
whether
it
were
a
layer
of
soot
or
a
night
without
a
moon
and
she
hid
her
face
on
the
king
shoulder
and
he
tried
to
kiss
her
but
could
not
make
her
look
up
until
he
said
or
even
a
woman
waywardness
then
she
looked
up
of
her
own
accord
and
kissed
him
in
this
way
she
resumed
it
became
my
custom
on
each
saturday
after
closing
the
forge
to
come
here
with
my
woman
raiment
and
wait
in
a
hollow
until
night
had
fallen
and
make
myself
clean
of
the
blackness
for
i
dared
not
do
this
by
daylight
or
be
seen
going
forth
from
my
forge
in
my
proper
person
but
why
did
you
choose
to
bathe
at
midnight
asked
the
king
she
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
and
then
said
hurriedly
i
did
not
choose
to
bathe
at
midnight
until
a
month
for
the
rest
she
resumed
i
was
hard
to
please
in
the
matter
of
the
shoes
because
i
knew
that
when
they
were
finished
you
would
ride
away
and
therefore
the
more
you
improved
the
crosser
i
became
and
if
i
have
tormented
you
for
a
month
it
was
because
you
tormented
me
by
refusing
to
speak
when
you
saw
me
here
in
spite
of
your
hateful
vow
and
you
would
not
even
look
at
my
cake
in
the
larder
women
are
strange
said
the
king
how
do
you
know
i
did
not
look
at
the
cake
i
do
know
she
said
as
hurriedly
as
before
and
if
i
would
not
tell
you
who
i
was
it
was
because
i
could
not
bear
on
the
other
hand
to
extort
from
you
a
love
you
seemed
so
reluctant
to
endure
until
indeed
it
became
of
its
own
accord
too
strong
even
for
the
purpose
which
brought
you
every
week
to
the
ring
for
i
knew
that
purpose
since
all
dwellers
in
washington
know
why
men
go
up
the
hill
with
the
new
moon
but
when
my
love
did
become
too
strong
for
my
vow
and
opened
my
lips
at
last
said
the
king
why
did
you
run
away
viola
said
had
you
not
run
away
the
week
before
and
now
i
have
answered
all
your
questions
no
said
the
king
not
all
you
have
told
me
yet
when
you
first
loved
me
viola
smiled
and
said
i
first
stole
barley
sugar
when
my
father
said
this
is
for
the
other
little
girl
over
the
way
and
i
first
loved
you
when
seeing
you
had
been
too
to
know
that
pepper
had
cast
her
shoes
i
feared
you
were
in
love
but
that
was
three
minutes
after
we
met
cried
the
king
was
it
as
much
as
that
said
she
now
after
awhile
viola
said
let
us
get
down
to
the
world
again
we
can
not
stay
here
for
ever
why
not
said
the
king
however
they
walked
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
stood
together
gazing
awhile
over
the
sunlit
earth
that
had
never
been
so
beautiful
to
either
of
them
for
their
sight
was
with
love
and
all
things
were
changed
now
i
know
how
she
looks
from
heaven
said
the
king
and
that
is
like
heaven
itself
let
us
go
for
i
think
she
will
still
look
so
at
our
coming
seeing
that
we
carry
heaven
with
us
so
they
went
downhill
to
the
forge
and
there
viola
said
to
her
lover
i
can
stay
no
longer
in
this
place
where
all
men
have
known
me
as
a
lad
and
besides
a
woman
home
is
where
her
husband
lives
but
i
live
only
in
a
barn
said
william
the
king
then
i
will
live
there
with
you
said
viola
and
from
this
very
night
but
first
i
will
shoe
pepper
anew
for
she
is
so
unequally
shod
that
she
might
spill
us
on
the
road
and
that
she
may
be
shod
worthily
of
herself
and
of
us
give
me
what
you
have
tied
up
in
your
blue
handkerchief
the
king
fetched
his
handkerchief
and
unknotted
it
and
gave
her
his
crown
and
scepter
and
she
set
him
at
the
bellows
and
made
three
golden
shoes
and
shod
the
nag
on
her
two
and
her
off
but
when
she
looked
at
the
near
which
the
king
had
shod
last
of
all
she
said
i
could
not
make
a
better
and
therefore
like
his
father
the
lad
must
shut
his
smithy
for
he
is
dead
then
she
put
the
three
shoes
she
had
removed
into
a
bag
with
some
other
trifles
and
while
she
did
so
the
king
took
what
remained
of
the
gold
and
made
it
into
two
rings
this
done
they
got
on
to
back
and
with
her
three
shoes
of
gold
and
one
of
iron
she
bore
them
the
way
the
king
had
come
when
they
passed
the
bush
hovel
they
saw
the
wise
woman
currying
her
broomstick
and
viola
cried
give
us
a
blessing
said
the
wise
woman
how
can
i
give
you
what
you
already
have
but
i
will
give
you
this
and
she
held
out
a
horseshoe
good
gracious
said
the
king
this
was
once
pepper
it
was
said
the
wise
woman
in
her
merriment
at
hearing
you
ask
a
silly
question
she
cast
it
outside
my
door
a
little
further
on
they
came
to
the
guess
gate
but
when
the
king
dismounting
swung
it
open
it
grated
on
something
in
the
road
he
stooped
and
lifted
a
horseshoe
wonder
of
wonders
exclaimed
the
king
this
also
was
pepper
what
shall
we
do
with
it
hang
it
up
hang
it
up
hang
creaked
the
gate
and
clicked
home
in
due
course
they
reached
the
doves
and
at
the
sound
of
hoofs
the
brothers
flocked
out
to
meet
them
is
all
well
cried
the
ringdove
seeing
the
king
only
and
have
you
returned
to
us
for
the
final
blessing
i
have
replied
the
king
for
i
bring
my
bride
behind
me
and
now
you
must
make
us
one
the
gentle
brothers
rejoicing
at
the
sight
of
their
happiness
and
their
beauty
led
them
in
and
there
they
were
wedded
the
doves
offered
them
to
eat
but
the
king
was
impatient
to
reach
his
barn
by
nightfall
so
they
got
again
on
pepper
back
and
as
they
were
about
to
leave
the
ringdove
said
i
have
something
of
yours
which
is
in
itself
a
thing
of
no
moment
yet
because
it
is
of
good
augury
take
it
with
you
and
he
gave
the
king
pepper
third
shoe
thank
you
said
the
king
i
will
hang
it
over
my
barn
door
now
he
urged
pepper
to
her
full
speed
and
they
went
at
a
gallop
past
the
hawking
sopers
who
hearing
the
clatter
came
running
into
the
road
stay
gallopers
stay
they
cried
and
make
merry
with
us
we
can
not
called
the
king
for
we
are
newly
married
good
luck
to
you
then
shouted
the
sopers
and
with
huzzas
and
laughter
flung
something
after
them
viola
stretched
out
her
hand
and
caught
it
in
and
it
was
a
horseshoe
the
tale
is
complete
she
laughed
and
now
you
know
where
pepper
picked
up
her
stones
soon
after
the
king
said
here
is
my
barn
and
he
sprang
down
and
lifted
his
bride
from
the
nag
back
and
brought
her
in
it
is
a
poor
place
he
said
gently
but
it
is
all
i
have
what
can
i
do
for
you
in
such
a
home
i
will
tell
you
said
viola
and
putting
her
hand
into
her
left
pocket
she
drew
out
the
ruby
winking
with
the
wine
of
mirth
you
can
dance
in
it
and
suddenly
they
caught
each
other
by
the
hands
and
went
capering
and
laughing
round
the
barn
like
children
hurrah
cried
william
now
i
know
what
a
king
should
do
in
a
barn
but
he
should
do
more
than
dance
in
it
said
viola
and
putting
her
hand
into
her
right
pocket
she
gave
him
the
pearl
as
pure
as
a
prayer
beloved
he
should
pray
in
it
too
and
william
looked
at
her
and
knelt
and
she
knelt
by
him
and
in
silence
they
prayed
the
same
prayer
side
by
side
then
william
rose
and
said
simply
now
i
know
but
she
knelt
still
and
took
from
her
girdle
the
diamond
as
bright
as
power
and
she
put
it
in
his
hand
saying
very
low
oh
my
dear
king
but
he
should
also
rule
in
it
and
she
kissed
his
hand
but
the
king
lifted
her
very
quickly
so
that
she
stood
equal
with
his
heart
and
embracing
her
he
said
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
you
beloved
what
will
a
queen
do
in
a
barn
the
same
as
a
king
she
whispered
and
drew
from
her
bosom
the
opal
as
lovely
and
as
variable
as
the
human
spirit
with
the
other
three
stones
you
may
if
you
will
buy
back
your
father
kingdom
but
this
which
contains
all
qualities
in
one
let
us
keep
for
ever
for
our
children
and
theirs
that
they
may
know
there
is
nothing
a
king
and
a
queen
may
not
do
in
a
barn
or
a
man
and
a
woman
anywhere
but
the
best
thing
they
can
do
is
to
work
in
it
then
going
out
she
came
back
with
the
bag
which
she
had
slung
on
pepper
back
and
took
from
it
her
father
tools
in
three
weeks
you
learned
all
i
learned
in
three
years
said
she
when
i
shod
pepper
this
morning
i
did
my
last
job
as
a
smith
for
now
i
shall
have
other
work
to
do
but
you
whether
you
choose
to
get
your
father
lands
again
or
no
i
pray
to
work
in
the
trade
i
have
given
you
for
i
have
made
you
the
very
king
of
smiths
and
all
men
should
do
the
thing
they
can
do
best
so
take
the
hammer
and
nail
up
the
horseshoes
over
the
door
while
i
get
supper
for
you
look
as
hungry
as
i
feel
but
there
nothing
to
eat
said
the
king
ruefully
however
he
went
outside
and
over
the
door
he
hung
as
many
shoes
as
there
are
nails
in
one
the
four
pepper
had
cast
on
the
road
and
the
three
he
had
first
made
for
her
as
he
drove
the
last
nail
home
viola
called
supper
is
ready
and
the
king
went
into
the
barn
and
saw
a
wedding
cake
and
now
if
you
please
mistress
joan
i
have
earned
my
apple
first
interlude
now
there
was
a
great
munching
of
apples
in
the
tree
for
to
tell
the
truth
during
the
latter
part
of
the
story
this
business
had
been
suspended
and
between
bites
the
milkmaids
discussed
the
merits
of
what
they
had
just
heard
jessica
what
is
your
opinion
of
this
tale
jane
jane
it
surprised
me
more
than
anything
for
who
could
have
suspected
that
the
lad
was
a
woman
martin
lads
are
to
be
suspected
of
any
mischief
mistress
jane
joscelyn
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
master
pippin
that
we
are
acquainted
with
the
habits
of
lads
martin
i
suppose
nothing
but
did
the
story
please
you
joscelyn
as
a
story
it
was
well
enough
to
pass
an
hour
i
would
be
willing
to
learn
whether
the
king
regained
his
kingdom
or
no
martin
i
think
he
did
since
you
may
go
to
this
day
to
the
little
city
on
the
banks
of
the
adur
which
is
after
his
barn
but
i
doubt
whether
he
lived
there
or
anywhere
but
in
the
barn
where
he
and
his
beloved
began
their
life
of
work
and
prayer
and
mirth
and
and
died
as
happily
as
they
had
lived
joan
i
am
glad
they
lived
happily
i
was
afraid
the
tale
would
end
unhappily
joyce
and
so
was
i
for
when
the
king
roamed
the
hills
for
a
whole
week
without
success
i
began
to
fear
he
would
never
find
the
woman
again
jennifer
i
for
my
part
feared
lest
he
should
not
open
his
lips
during
the
fourth
vigil
and
so
must
become
a
dove
for
the
remainder
of
his
days
jane
it
was
but
by
the
grace
of
a
moment
he
did
not
drown
himself
in
the
pond
jessica
or
what
if
by
some
unlucky
chance
he
had
never
come
to
the
forge
at
all
martin
in
any
of
these
events
i
grant
you
the
tale
must
have
ended
in
disaster
and
this
is
the
special
wonder
of
that
though
they
may
end
unhappily
in
a
thousand
ways
and
happily
in
only
one
yet
that
one
will
vanquish
the
thousand
as
often
as
the
desires
of
lovers
run
in
tandem
but
there
is
one
accident
you
have
left
out
of
count
and
it
is
the
worst
i
know
of
in
the
path
of
happy
endings
all
the
milkmaids
what
is
it
martin
suppose
the
lovely
viola
had
been
a
sworn
virgin
and
a
hater
of
men
there
was
silence
in
the
joscelyn
she
would
have
been
none
the
worse
for
that
singer
and
the
tale
would
have
been
none
the
less
a
tale
which
is
all
we
look
for
from
you
this
talk
of
happy
endings
is
silly
talk
the
king
might
have
sought
the
woman
in
vain
or
kept
his
vow
or
drowned
himself
or
ridden
to
the
confines
of
kent
for
aught
i
care
joyce
or
jennifer
or
jessica
or
jane
or
martin
i
am
silenced
tales
are
but
tales
and
not
worth
speculation
and
see
the
moon
is
gone
to
sleep
behind
a
cloud
which
shows
us
nothing
save
the
rainbow
of
her
dreams
it
is
time
we
did
as
she
does
like
in
august
the
milkmaids
slid
from
their
leafy
heaven
and
dropped
to
the
grass
and
here
they
pillowed
their
heads
on
their
soft
arms
and
soon
were
breathing
the
breath
of
sleep
but
little
joan
sat
on
in
the
swing
now
all
this
while
she
had
kept
between
her
hands
the
promised
apple
turning
and
turning
it
like
one
in
doubt
and
presently
martin
looked
aside
at
her
with
a
smile
and
held
his
open
palm
to
receive
his
reward
and
first
she
glanced
at
him
and
then
at
the
sleepers
and
last
she
tossed
the
apple
lightly
in
the
air
but
by
some
mishap
she
tossed
it
too
high
and
it
made
an
arc
clean
over
the
tree
and
fell
in
a
distant
corner
by
the
hedge
so
she
ran
quickly
to
recover
it
for
him
and
he
ran
likewise
and
they
stooped
and
rose
together
she
with
the
apple
in
her
hands
he
with
his
hands
on
hers
at
which
she
blushed
a
little
but
held
fast
to
the
fruit
what
said
martin
pippin
am
i
never
to
have
my
apple
she
answered
softly
only
when
i
am
satisfied
as
you
promised
and
are
you
not
what
have
i
left
undone
joan
please
master
pippin
what
did
the
young
king
look
like
martin
fool
that
i
am
to
leave
these
vital
things
untold
i
shall
avoid
this
error
in
future
he
was
more
than
middle
tall
and
broad
in
the
shoulders
and
he
had
eyes
and
a
fresh
color
and
a
kind
and
merry
look
and
dark
brown
hair
that
was
not
always
as
sleek
as
he
wished
it
to
be
joan
oh
martin
with
this
further
oddity
that
above
the
nape
of
his
neck
was
a
whitish
tuft
which
though
he
took
great
pains
to
conceal
it
continually
obtruded
through
the
darker
hair
like
the
cottontail
on
the
back
of
a
rabbit
joan
oh
oh
and
she
became
as
red
as
a
cherry
martin
may
i
have
my
apple
joan
but
had
not
he
a
mustache
martin
he
fondly
believed
so
joan
with
unexpected
fire
it
was
a
big
and
beautiful
mustache
martin
fervently
there
was
never
a
king
of
twenty
years
with
one
so
big
and
beautiful
she
gave
him
the
apple
martin
thank
you
will
you
because
i
have
answered
many
questions
now
answer
one
joan
yes
martin
then
tell
me
this
what
is
your
quarrel
with
men
joan
oh
master
pippin
they
say
that
one
and
one
make
two
martin
is
this
possible
good
heavens
are
men
such
numskulls
when
they
have
but
to
go
to
the
littlest
woman
on
earth
to
learn
what
you
and
i
well
know
that
one
and
one
make
one
and
sometimes
three
or
four
or
even
but
never
two
fie
upon
these
men
joan
i
am
glad
you
think
i
am
in
the
right
but
how
obstinate
they
are
martin
as
obstinate
as
children
and
should
be
birched
as
roundly
joan
oh
but
you
would
not
birch
children
martin
you
are
right
again
they
should
be
coaxed
joan
yes
no
i
mean
good
night
dear
singer
martin
good
night
dear
milkmaid
sleep
sweetly
among
your
comrades
who
are
wiser
than
we
being
so
indifferent
to
happy
endings
that
they
would
never
unpadlock
sorrow
though
they
had
the
key
in
their
keeping
then
he
took
her
hands
in
one
of
his
and
put
his
other
hand
very
gently
under
her
chin
and
lifted
it
till
he
could
look
into
her
face
and
he
said
give
me
the
key
to
gillian
prison
little
joan
because
you
love
happy
endings
joan
dear
martin
i
can
not
give
you
the
key
martin
why
not
joan
because
i
stuck
it
inside
your
apple
so
he
kissed
her
and
they
parted
and
lay
down
and
slept
she
among
her
comrades
under
the
and
he
under
the
briony
in
the
hedge
and
the
moon
came
out
of
her
dream
and
watched
theirs
with
morning
came
a
hoarse
voice
calling
along
the
hedge
maids
maids
maids
up
sprang
the
milkmaids
rubbing
their
eyes
and
stretching
their
arms
and
up
sprang
martin
likewise
and
seeing
him
joscelyn
was
stricken
with
dismay
it
is
old
gillman
our
master
she
whispered
come
with
bread
and
questions
quick
singer
quick
into
the
hollow
russet
before
he
reaches
the
hole
in
the
hedge
swiftly
the
milkmaids
hustled
martin
into
the
russet
tree
and
concealed
him
at
the
very
moment
when
the
farmer
was
come
to
the
peephole
filling
it
with
his
round
red
face
and
broad
gray
fringe
of
whiskers
like
the
winter
sun
on
a
sky
that
is
going
to
snow
good
morrow
maids
quoth
old
gillman
good
morrow
master
said
they
is
my
daughter
come
to
her
mind
yet
no
master
said
little
joan
but
i
begin
to
have
hopes
that
she
may
if
she
do
not
groaned
gillman
i
know
not
what
will
happen
to
the
farmstead
for
it
is
six
months
now
since
i
tasted
water
and
how
can
a
man
follow
his
business
who
is
fuddled
day
and
night
with
barley
wine
life
is
full
of
hardships
of
which
daughters
are
the
greatest
gillian
he
cried
when
will
ye
come
into
your
senses
and
out
of
the
but
gillian
took
no
more
heed
of
him
than
of
the
quacking
of
the
drake
on
the
duckpond
well
here
is
your
bread
said
gillman
and
he
thrust
a
basket
with
seven
loaves
in
it
through
the
gap
and
may
bring
better
tidings
one
moment
dear
master
entreated
little
joan
tell
me
please
how
nancy
my
jersey
fares
pines
for
you
pines
for
you
maid
though
charles
does
his
best
by
her
but
it
is
as
though
she
had
taken
a
vow
to
let
down
no
milk
till
you
come
again
rack
and
ruin
rack
and
ruin
and
the
old
man
retreated
as
he
had
come
muttering
rack
and
ruin
the
length
of
the
hedge
the
maids
then
set
about
preparing
breakfast
which
was
simplicity
itself
being
bread
and
apples
than
which
no
breakfast
could
be
sweeter
there
was
a
loaf
for
each
maid
and
one
over
for
gillian
which
they
set
upon
the
wall
of
the
taking
away
yesterday
loaf
untouched
and
stale
does
she
never
eat
asked
martin
she
has
scarcely
broken
bread
in
six
months
said
joscelyn
and
what
she
lives
on
besides
her
thoughts
we
do
not
know
thoughts
are
a
fast
or
a
feast
according
to
their
nature
said
martin
so
let
us
feed
the
ducks
who
have
none
they
broke
the
stale
bread
into
fragments
and
when
the
ducks
had
made
a
meal
returned
to
their
own
and
of
two
loaves
made
seven
parts
that
martin
might
have
his
share
and
to
this
they
added
apples
according
to
their
fancies
red
or
russet
green
or
golden
after
breakfast
at
martin
suggestion
they
made
little
boats
of
twigs
and
leaves
and
sailed
them
on
the
duckpond
where
they
met
with
many
adventures
and
calamities
from
driftweed
small
breezes
and
the
curiosity
of
the
ducks
and
before
they
were
aware
of
it
the
dinner
hour
was
upon
them
when
they
divided
two
more
loaves
as
before
and
ate
apples
at
will
then
martin
taking
a
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
proposed
a
game
of
and
the
girls
delighted
counter
to
find
the
blindman
and
joyce
was
he
so
martin
tied
the
handkerchief
over
her
eyes
can
you
see
asked
martin
of
course
i
ca
see
said
joyce
promise
said
martin
i
hope
master
pippin
said
jane
reprovingly
that
you
can
take
a
girl
word
for
it
i
sure
i
hope
i
can
said
martin
and
turned
joyce
round
three
times
and
ran
for
his
life
and
joyce
caught
jane
on
the
spot
and
guessed
her
immediately
then
jane
was
blindfolded
and
she
was
so
particular
about
not
seeing
that
it
was
quite
ten
minutes
before
she
caught
jennifer
but
she
knew
who
she
was
by
the
feel
of
her
gown
and
jennifer
caught
joscelyn
and
guessed
her
by
her
girdle
and
joscelyn
caught
jessica
and
guessed
her
by
the
darn
in
her
sleeve
and
jessica
caught
joan
and
guessed
her
by
her
ribbon
and
joan
caught
martin
and
guessed
him
by
his
difference
so
then
martin
was
blindman
and
it
seemed
as
though
he
would
never
have
eyes
again
for
though
he
caught
all
the
girls
one
after
another
he
could
guess
which
was
which
and
gave
jane
nose
to
jessica
and
jessica
hands
to
joscelyn
and
joscelyn
chin
to
joyce
and
hair
to
jennifer
and
jennifer
eyebrows
to
joan
but
when
he
caught
joan
he
guessed
her
at
once
by
her
littleness
in
due
course
the
change
of
light
told
them
it
was
and
with
great
surprise
they
ate
the
last
two
loaves
to
the
sweet
accompaniment
of
the
apples
i
would
never
have
supposed
said
joscelyn
as
they
gathered
under
the
central
tree
at
the
close
of
the
meal
that
a
day
could
pass
so
quickly
bait
time
with
a
diversion
said
martin
and
he
will
run
like
a
donkey
after
a
dangled
carrot
it
has
nearly
been
the
happiest
day
of
my
life
said
joyce
with
a
sly
glance
at
martin
and
why
not
quite
said
he
because
it
lacked
a
story
singer
she
said
demurely
what
can
be
rectified
said
martin
must
be
and
the
day
is
not
yet
departed
but
still
lingers
like
a
listener
on
the
threshold
of
night
so
set
the
swing
in
motion
dear
mistress
joyce
and
to
its
measure
i
will
endeavor
to
swing
my
thoughts
which
have
till
now
been
laggards
with
these
words
he
set
joyce
in
the
swing
and
himself
upon
the
branch
beside
it
as
before
and
the
other
milkmaids
climbed
into
their
perches
rustling
the
fruit
down
from
the
shaken
boughs
and
he
made
of
joyce
lap
a
basket
for
the
harvest
and
he
and
each
of
the
maids
chose
an
apple
as
though
supper
had
not
been
we
are
listening
said
joscelyn
from
above
not
all
of
you
said
martin
and
he
looked
up
at
joscelyn
alert
on
her
branch
and
down
at
gillian
prone
on
the
steps
you
are
here
for
no
other
purpose
said
joscelyn
than
to
make
them
listen
that
will
not
i
would
not
have
you
think
we
desire
to
listen
i
think
nothing
but
that
you
are
the
prey
of
circumstances
said
martin
constrained
like
flowers
to
bear
witness
to
that
which
is
against
all
nature
what
do
you
mean
by
that
said
joscelyn
flowers
are
nature
itself
so
men
have
agreed
replied
martin
yet
who
but
men
have
compelled
them
repeatedly
to
assert
such
unnaturalnesses
as
that
foxes
wear
gloves
and
cuckoos
shoes
out
on
the
pretty
fibbers
please
do
not
be
angry
with
the
flowers
said
joan
how
could
i
be
said
martin
the
flowers
must
always
be
forgiven
because
their
inconsistencies
lie
always
at
men
doors
besides
who
does
not
love
then
martin
kicked
his
heels
against
the
tree
and
sang
idly
when
cuckoos
fly
in
shoes
and
foxes
run
in
gloves
then
butterflies
wo
go
in
twos
and
boys
will
leave
their
loves
a
silly
song
said
joscelyn
martin
if
you
say
so
for
my
part
i
can
never
tell
the
difference
between
silliness
and
sense
jane
then
how
can
a
good
song
be
told
from
a
bad
you
must
go
by
something
martin
i
go
by
the
sound
but
since
mistress
joscelyn
pronounces
my
song
silly
i
can
only
suppose
she
has
seen
cuckoos
flying
in
shoes
joscelyn
you
are
always
supposing
nonsense
who
ever
heard
of
cuckoos
flying
in
shoes
jane
or
of
foxes
running
in
gloves
joan
or
of
butterflies
going
in
ones
martin
or
of
boys
joscelyn
i
have
frequently
seen
butterflies
going
in
ones
foolish
joan
and
the
argument
was
not
against
butterflies
but
cuckoos
martin
and
their
shoes
please
dear
mistress
joan
do
not
look
so
downcast
nor
you
dear
mistress
joscelyn
so
vexed
let
us
see
if
we
can
not
turn
a
more
sensible
song
upon
this
theme
and
he
sang
cuckoo
shoes
are
cuckoos
shoes
they
shoes
which
cuckoos
never
don
and
cuckoo
nests
are
cuckoos
nests
but
other
birds
for
a
moment
gone
and
nothing
that
the
cuckoo
has
but
he
does
make
a
mock
upon
for
even
when
the
cuckoo
sings
he
only
says
what
is
true
when
happy
lovers
first
swore
oaths
an
artful
cuckoo
called
and
flew
yes
and
when
lovers
weep
like
dew
the
teasing
cuckoo
laughs
cuckoo
what
need
for
tears
cuckoo
cuckoo
as
martin
ended
gillian
raised
herself
upon
an
elbow
and
looked
no
more
into
the
green
grass
but
across
the
green
duckpond
the
second
song
seems
to
me
as
irrelevant
as
the
first
said
joscelyn
but
i
observe
that
you
cuckooed
so
loudly
as
to
startle
our
mistress
out
of
her
inattention
so
if
you
mean
to
tell
us
another
story
by
all
means
tell
it
now
not
that
i
care
except
for
our
extremity
it
is
my
only
object
to
ease
it
said
martin
so
bear
with
me
as
well
as
you
may
during
the
recital
of
young
gerard
young
gerard
there
was
once
dear
maidens
a
shepherd
who
kept
his
master
sheep
on
amberley
mount
his
name
was
gerard
and
he
was
always
called
young
gerard
to
distinguish
him
from
the
other
shepherd
who
was
known
as
old
gerard
yet
was
not
as
you
might
suppose
his
father
their
master
was
the
lord
of
combe
ivy
that
lay
in
the
southern
valleys
of
the
hills
toward
the
sea
he
owned
the
grazing
on
the
whole
circle
of
the
downs
between
the
two
great
roads
on
amberley
and
perry
and
wepham
and
blackpatch
and
cockhill
and
highdown
and
barnsfarm
and
sullington
and
chantry
but
the
two
gerards
lived
together
in
the
great
shed
behind
the
copse
between
rackham
hill
and
kithurst
and
the
way
they
came
to
do
so
was
this
one
night
in
april
when
old
gerard
gray
beard
was
still
brown
the
door
of
the
shed
was
pushed
open
letting
in
not
only
the
winds
of
spring
but
a
woman
wrapped
in
a
green
cloak
with
a
lining
of
and
a
border
of
silver
flowers
and
golden
cherries
in
one
hand
she
swung
a
crystal
lantern
set
in
a
silver
frame
but
it
had
no
light
in
it
and
in
the
other
she
held
a
small
slip
of
a
but
it
had
no
bloom
on
it
her
dress
was
white
or
had
been
for
the
skirts
of
it
and
her
mantle
were
draggled
and
sodden
and
her
green
shoes
stained
and
torn
and
her
long
fair
hair
lay
limp
and
dank
upon
her
mantle
whose
hood
had
fallen
away
and
the
shadows
round
her
blue
eyes
were
as
black
as
pools
under
hedgerows
thawing
after
a
frost
and
her
lovely
face
was
as
white
as
the
snowbanks
they
bed
in
behind
her
came
another
woman
in
a
duffle
cloak
a
crone
with
eyes
as
black
as
sloes
and
a
skin
as
brown
as
beechnuts
and
unkempt
hair
like
the
fireless
smoke
of
old
man
beard
straying
where
it
will
on
the
november
woodsides
she
too
was
wet
and
soiled
but
full
of
life
where
the
young
one
seemed
full
of
death
the
shepherd
looked
at
this
strange
pair
and
said
surlily
what
want
ye
shelter
replied
the
crone
she
pushed
the
lady
who
never
spoke
into
the
shed
and
took
from
her
shoulders
the
wet
mantle
and
from
her
hands
the
lantern
and
the
tree
and
led
her
to
the
shepherd
bed
and
laid
her
down
then
she
spread
the
mantle
over
the
shepherd
bench
and
lie
there
said
she
till
love
warms
ye
next
she
hung
the
lantern
up
on
a
nail
in
the
wall
and
swing
there
said
she
till
love
lights
ye
last
she
took
the
shepherd
trowel
and
went
outside
the
shed
and
set
the
beside
the
door
and
she
said
grow
there
till
love
blossoms
ye
after
this
she
came
inside
and
sat
down
at
the
bedhead
gerard
the
shepherd
who
had
watched
her
proceedings
without
word
or
gesture
said
to
himself
they
come
through
the
floods
he
looked
across
at
the
women
and
raised
his
voice
to
ask
did
ye
come
through
the
floods
the
lady
moaned
a
little
and
the
crone
said
let
her
be
and
go
to
sleep
what
does
it
matter
where
we
came
from
by
night
by
daybreak
we
shall
both
of
us
be
gone
no
matter
whither
the
shepherd
said
no
more
for
though
he
was
both
curious
and
he
had
not
the
courage
to
disturb
the
lady
knowing
by
the
richness
of
her
attire
that
she
was
of
the
quality
and
the
iron
of
serfdom
was
driven
deep
into
his
soul
so
he
went
to
sleep
on
his
stool
as
he
had
been
bidden
but
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
was
awakened
by
a
gusty
wind
and
the
banging
of
his
door
and
he
started
up
rubbing
his
knuckles
in
his
eyes
saying
i
been
dreaming
of
strange
women
but
was
it
a
dream
or
no
he
peered
about
the
shed
and
the
crone
had
vanished
utterly
but
the
lady
still
lay
on
his
bed
and
when
he
went
over
to
look
at
her
she
was
dead
but
beside
her
lay
a
newborn
child
that
opened
its
eyes
and
wailed
at
him
then
the
shepherd
ran
to
his
open
door
and
stared
into
the
blowing
night
but
there
were
no
more
signs
of
the
crone
without
than
there
were
within
so
he
fastened
the
latch
and
came
back
to
the
bedside
and
examined
the
but
at
this
point
martin
pippin
interrupted
himself
and
seizing
the
rope
of
the
swing
set
it
rocking
violently
joyce
i
shall
fall
i
shall
fall
martin
then
you
will
be
no
worse
off
than
i
who
have
fallen
already
for
i
see
you
do
not
like
my
story
joyce
what
makes
you
say
so
martin
till
now
you
listened
with
all
your
ears
but
a
moment
ago
you
turned
away
your
head
a
moment
too
late
to
hide
the
disappointment
in
your
eyes
joyce
it
is
true
i
am
disappointed
because
the
beautiful
lady
is
dead
and
how
can
a
be
if
half
the
lovers
are
dead
martin
dear
mistress
joyce
what
has
love
to
do
with
death
love
and
death
are
strangers
and
speak
in
different
tongues
women
may
die
and
men
may
die
but
lovers
are
ignorant
of
mortality
joyce
pouting
that
may
be
singer
but
lovers
are
also
a
man
and
a
woman
and
the
woman
is
dead
and
the
ended
before
we
have
even
heard
it
you
should
not
have
let
the
woman
die
what
sort
of
is
this
now
the
woman
is
dead
martin
are
not
more
nests
than
one
built
in
a
give
me
i
pray
you
two
hairs
of
your
head
she
plucked
two
and
gave
them
to
him
turning
her
pouting
to
laughing
one
of
them
martin
coiled
and
held
before
his
lips
and
blew
on
it
there
it
flies
said
he
and
gave
her
back
the
second
hair
hold
fast
by
this
and
keep
it
from
its
fellow
with
all
your
might
for
to
part
true
mates
baffles
the
forces
of
the
universe
and
when
you
give
me
this
second
hair
again
i
swear
i
will
send
it
where
it
will
find
its
fellow
but
i
will
never
ask
for
it
until
my
story
ended
you
say
to
me
i
am
content
examining
the
child
repeated
martin
the
shepherd
discovered
it
to
be
a
lusty
and
this
rejoiced
him
so
that
while
the
baby
wept
he
laughed
aloud
it
is
better
to
weep
for
something
than
for
nothing
said
he
and
to
laugh
for
something
likewise
tears
are
for
serfs
and
laughter
is
for
freedmen
for
he
had
conceived
the
plan
of
selling
the
child
to
his
master
the
lord
of
combe
ivy
and
buying
his
freedom
with
the
purchase
money
so
in
the
morning
he
carried
the
body
of
the
lady
into
the
heart
of
the
copse
and
there
he
dug
a
grave
and
laid
her
in
it
in
her
white
gown
and
afterwards
he
went
up
hill
and
down
dale
to
his
master
and
said
he
had
a
man
for
sale
the
lord
of
combe
ivy
who
was
a
jovial
lord
and
a
bachelor
laughed
at
the
tale
he
had
to
tell
but
being
always
of
the
humor
for
a
jest
he
paid
the
shepherd
a
gold
piece
for
the
child
and
promised
him
another
each
midnight
on
the
anniversary
of
its
birth
but
on
the
anniversary
he
said
the
shepherd
was
to
bring
back
the
gold
pieces
he
had
received
and
instead
of
adding
another
to
them
he
would
take
them
again
and
make
the
serf
a
freedman
and
the
child
his
serf
for
said
the
lord
of
combe
ivy
an
infant
is
a
poor
deal
for
a
man
in
his
prime
as
you
are
but
a
youth
come
to
manhood
is
a
good
exchange
for
a
graybeard
as
you
will
be
therefore
rear
this
babe
as
you
please
and
if
he
live
to
manhood
so
much
the
better
for
you
but
if
he
die
first
it
all
one
to
me
the
shepherd
had
hoped
for
a
better
bargain
but
he
must
needs
be
content
with
seeing
liberty
at
a
distance
so
he
returned
to
his
shed
on
the
hills
and
made
a
leather
purse
to
keep
his
in
and
hung
it
round
his
neck
touching
it
fifty
times
a
day
under
his
shirt
to
be
sure
it
was
still
there
and
presently
he
sought
among
his
ewes
one
who
had
borne
her
young
saying
you
shall
mother
two
instead
of
one
and
the
baby
sucked
the
ewe
like
her
very
lamb
and
thrived
upon
the
milk
and
the
shepherd
called
the
child
gerard
after
himself
since
he
said
it
is
as
good
a
name
for
a
shepherd
as
another
and
from
that
time
they
became
the
young
and
old
gerards
to
all
who
knew
them
so
the
young
gerard
grew
up
and
as
he
grew
the
grew
likewise
but
in
the
strangest
fashion
for
though
it
flourished
past
all
expectation
it
never
put
forth
either
leaf
or
blossom
this
bitterly
vexed
old
gerard
who
had
hoped
in
time
for
fruit
and
the
frustration
of
his
hopes
became
to
him
a
cause
of
grievance
against
the
boy
a
further
grudge
was
that
by
no
manner
of
means
could
he
succeed
in
lighting
any
wick
or
candle
in
the
silver
lantern
of
which
he
desired
to
make
use
but
if
your
tree
and
your
lantern
wo
work
said
he
it
no
reason
why
you
should
so
he
put
young
gerard
to
work
first
as
sheepboy
to
his
own
flock
but
later
the
boy
had
a
flock
of
his
own
there
was
no
love
lost
between
these
two
and
kicks
and
curses
were
the
young
one
fare
for
he
was
often
idle
and
often
a
truant
and
none
was
held
responsible
for
him
except
the
old
shepherd
who
was
selling
him
year
by
year
to
their
master
because
of
what
depended
on
him
old
gerard
was
constrained
to
show
him
some
sort
of
care
when
he
would
liever
have
wrung
his
neck
the
boy
fits
exasperated
the
man
whether
he
was
cutting
strange
capers
and
laughing
without
reason
as
he
frequently
did
or
sitting
a
whole
evening
in
a
morose
dream
staring
at
the
fire
or
at
the
stars
and
saying
never
a
word
the
coloring
was
as
mingled
as
his
moods
a
blend
of
light
and
dark
black
hair
brown
skin
blue
eyes
and
golden
lashes
a
very
odd
anomaly
martin
what
is
it
mistress
joyce
joyce
i
said
nothing
master
pippin
martin
i
thought
i
heard
you
sigh
joyce
i
did
not
you
did
not
martin
my
imagination
exceeds
all
bounds
because
of
their
mutual
dislike
when
the
boy
was
put
in
charge
of
his
own
sheep
the
two
shepherds
spent
their
days
apart
the
old
gerard
grazed
his
flock
to
the
east
as
far
as
chantry
but
the
young
gerard
grazed
his
flock
to
the
west
as
far
as
amberley
whose
lovely
dome
was
dearer
to
him
than
all
the
other
hills
of
sussex
and
here
he
would
sit
all
day
watching
the
stalk
over
the
face
of
the
downs
or
slipping
along
the
land
below
him
with
the
sun
running
swiftly
after
like
a
carpet
of
light
unrolling
itself
upon
a
dusky
floor
and
in
the
evening
he
watched
the
smoke
going
up
from
the
tiny
cottages
till
it
was
almost
dark
and
a
hundred
tiny
lights
were
lit
in
a
hundred
tiny
windows
sometimes
on
his
rare
holidays
and
on
other
days
too
he
ran
away
to
the
wildbrooks
to
watch
the
herons
or
to
find
in
the
the
tallest
kingcups
in
the
whole
world
and
the
myriad
treasures
of
the
river
the
giant
comfrey
purple
and
white
meadowsweet
john
wort
purple
willowherb
and
the
others
or
whatever
number
else
you
please
that
go
to
make
a
myriad
he
came
to
know
more
about
the
ways
of
the
wildbrooks
than
any
other
lad
of
those
parts
and
one
day
he
rediscovered
the
lost
causeway
that
can
be
traveled
even
in
the
floods
when
the
land
lies
under
a
lake
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
he
kept
this
like
many
other
things
a
secret
but
he
had
one
more
precious
still
for
as
he
lay
and
watched
the
play
of
sun
and
shadow
on
the
plains
he
fancied
a
world
of
strange
places
he
had
known
somewhere
beyond
the
veils
of
light
and
mist
that
hung
between
his
vision
and
the
distance
and
he
fell
into
a
frequent
dream
of
tunes
and
laughter
and
sunlit
boughs
in
blossom
and
dancing
under
the
boughs
or
of
fires
burning
in
the
open
night
and
a
wilder
singing
and
dancing
in
the
starlight
and
often
when
his
body
was
lying
on
the
round
hill
or
by
the
smoky
hearth
his
thoughts
were
running
with
lithe
boys
as
strong
and
careless
as
he
was
or
playing
with
lovely
girls
with
flowing
hair
sometimes
these
people
were
fair
and
and
in
light
and
lovely
clothing
and
at
others
they
were
dark
with
eyes
of
mischief
and
clad
in
the
gayest
rags
and
sometimes
they
came
to
him
in
a
mingled
company
made
one
by
their
careless
hearts
one
evening
in
april
on
the
twelfth
anniversary
when
young
gerard
came
to
gather
his
flock
a
lamb
was
missing
so
to
escape
a
scolding
he
waited
awhile
on
the
hills
till
old
gerard
should
be
gone
about
his
business
what
this
was
young
gerard
did
not
know
he
only
knew
that
each
year
on
this
night
the
old
shepherd
left
him
to
his
own
devices
and
returned
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
not
therefore
until
he
judged
that
the
master
must
have
left
the
hut
did
the
boy
fold
his
sheep
and
this
done
he
ran
out
on
the
hills
again
seeking
the
lost
lamb
for
careless
though
he
was
he
cared
for
his
sheep
as
he
did
for
all
things
that
ran
on
legs
or
flew
on
wings
so
he
went
swinging
his
lantern
under
the
stars
singing
and
whistling
and
smelling
the
spring
now
and
then
he
paused
and
bleated
like
a
ewe
and
presently
a
small
whimper
answered
his
signal
my
lost
lamb
crying
on
the
hills
said
young
gerard
he
called
again
but
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
other
stopped
and
for
a
moment
he
stood
quite
still
listening
and
perplexed
where
are
you
my
lamb
said
he
here
said
a
little
frightened
voice
behind
a
bush
he
laughed
aloud
and
went
forward
and
soon
discovered
a
tiny
girl
cowering
under
a
thorn
when
she
saw
him
she
ran
quickly
and
grasped
his
sleeve
and
hid
her
face
in
it
and
wept
she
was
small
for
her
years
which
were
not
more
than
eight
young
gerard
who
was
big
for
his
picked
her
up
and
looked
at
her
kindly
and
curiously
what
is
it
you
little
thing
said
he
i
got
lost
said
the
child
shyly
through
her
tears
well
now
you
found
said
young
gerard
so
do
cry
any
more
yes
but
i
hungry
sobbed
the
child
then
come
with
me
will
you
where
to
to
a
feast
in
a
palace
oh
yes
she
said
young
gerard
set
her
on
his
shoulder
and
went
back
the
way
he
had
come
till
the
dark
shape
of
his
wretched
shed
stood
big
between
them
and
the
sky
is
this
your
palace
said
the
child
that
it
said
young
gerard
i
did
know
palaces
had
cracks
in
the
walls
said
she
this
one
has
explained
young
gerard
because
it
so
old
and
she
was
satisfied
then
she
asked
what
is
that
funny
tree
by
the
door
it
a
my
father
have
flowers
on
them
said
she
this
one
has
said
young
gerard
because
it
not
old
enough
one
day
will
it
be
she
asked
one
day
he
said
and
that
contented
her
he
then
carried
her
into
the
shed
and
she
looked
around
eagerly
to
see
what
a
palace
might
be
like
inside
and
it
was
full
of
flickering
lights
and
shadows
and
the
scent
of
burning
wood
and
she
did
not
see
how
poor
and
dirty
the
room
was
for
the
firelight
gleamed
upon
a
mass
of
golden
fruit
and
silver
bloom
embroidered
on
the
covering
of
the
settle
by
the
hearth
and
sparkled
against
a
silver
and
crystal
lantern
hanging
in
the
chimney
and
between
the
cracks
on
the
walls
young
gerard
had
stuck
wands
of
gold
and
silver
palm
and
branches
of
snowy
blackthorn
and
on
the
floor
was
a
dish
full
of
celandine
and
daisies
and
a
broken
jar
of
small
wild
daffodils
and
the
child
knew
that
all
these
things
were
the
treasures
of
queens
and
kings
why
do
you
have
that
she
asked
pointing
to
the
crystal
lantern
as
young
gerard
set
down
his
horn
one
because
i
ca
light
it
said
he
let
me
light
it
she
begged
so
he
fetched
it
from
its
nail
and
thrust
a
pine
twig
in
the
fire
and
gave
her
the
torch
but
in
vain
she
tried
to
light
the
wick
which
always
spluttered
and
went
out
again
so
seeing
her
disappointment
young
gerard
hung
the
lantern
up
saying
firelight
is
prettier
and
he
set
her
by
the
fire
and
filled
her
lap
with
cones
and
dry
leaves
and
dead
bracken
to
burn
and
make
crackle
and
turn
into
fiery
ferns
and
she
was
pleased
then
he
looked
about
and
found
his
own
wooden
cup
and
went
away
and
came
back
with
the
cup
full
of
milk
set
on
a
platter
heaped
with
primroses
and
when
he
brought
it
to
her
she
looked
at
it
with
shining
eyes
and
asked
is
this
the
feast
that
it
said
young
gerard
and
she
drank
it
eagerly
and
while
she
drank
young
gerard
fetched
a
pipe
and
began
to
whistle
tunes
on
it
as
mad
as
any
thrush
and
the
child
began
to
laugh
and
jumped
up
spilling
her
leaves
and
primroses
and
danced
between
the
fitful
lights
and
shadows
as
though
she
were
now
a
shadow
taken
shape
and
now
a
flame
whenever
he
paused
she
cried
oh
let
me
dance
do
stop
let
me
go
on
dancing
until
at
the
same
moment
she
dropped
panting
on
the
hearth
and
he
flung
his
pipe
behind
him
and
fell
on
his
back
with
his
heels
in
the
air
crying
pouf
think
i
the
four
quarters
of
heaven
in
my
lungs
or
what
but
as
though
to
prove
he
had
yet
a
capful
of
wind
under
his
ribs
he
suddenly
began
to
sing
a
song
she
never
heard
before
and
it
went
like
this
i
looked
before
me
and
behind
i
looked
beyond
the
sun
and
wind
beyond
the
rainbow
and
the
snow
and
saw
a
land
i
used
to
know
the
floods
rolled
up
to
keep
me
still
a
captive
on
my
heavenly
hill
and
on
their
bright
and
dangerous
glass
was
written
boy
you
shall
not
pass
i
laughed
aloud
you
shining
seas
i
run
away
the
day
i
please
i
am
not
winged
like
any
plover
yet
i
a
way
shall
take
me
over
i
am
not
finned
like
any
bream
yet
i
can
cross
you
lake
and
stream
and
i
my
hidden
land
shall
find
that
lies
beyond
the
sun
and
wind
past
drowned
grass
and
drowning
trees
i
run
away
the
day
i
please
i
run
like
one
whom
nothing
harms
with
my
bonny
in
my
arms
what
does
that
mean
asked
the
child
i
sure
i
do
know
said
young
gerard
he
kicked
at
the
dying
log
on
the
hearth
and
sent
a
fountain
of
sparks
up
the
chimney
the
child
threw
a
dry
leaf
and
saw
it
shrivel
and
young
gerard
stirred
the
white
ash
and
blew
up
the
embers
and
held
a
fan
of
bracken
to
them
till
the
fire
ran
up
its
veins
like
life
in
the
veins
of
a
man
and
the
frond
that
had
already
lived
and
died
became
a
gleaming
spirit
and
then
it
too
fell
in
ashes
among
the
ash
then
young
gerard
took
a
handful
of
twigs
and
branches
and
began
to
build
upon
the
ash
a
castle
of
many
sorts
of
wood
and
the
child
helped
him
laying
hazel
on
his
beech
and
fir
upon
his
oak
and
often
before
their
turret
was
quite
reared
a
spark
would
catch
at
the
dry
fringes
of
the
fir
or
the
brown
oakleaves
and
one
twig
or
another
would
vanish
from
the
castle
how
quickly
wood
burns
said
the
child
that
the
lovely
part
of
it
said
young
gerard
the
fire
is
always
changing
and
doing
different
things
with
it
and
they
watched
the
fire
together
and
smelled
its
smoke
that
had
as
many
smells
as
there
were
sorts
of
wood
sometimes
it
was
like
roast
coffee
and
sometimes
like
roast
chestnuts
and
sometimes
like
incense
and
they
saw
the
lichen
on
old
stumps
crinkle
into
golden
ferns
or
fire
run
up
a
dead
tail
of
creeper
in
a
red
s
and
vanish
in
like
an
indian
boy
climbing
a
rope
or
crawl
right
through
the
middle
of
a
making
hieroglyphics
that
glowed
and
faded
between
the
gray
scales
of
the
bark
and
then
suddenly
it
caught
the
whole
scaffolding
of
their
castle
and
blazed
up
through
the
fir
and
oak
and
spiny
thorns
and
dead
leaves
and
the
bits
of
old
bark
all
over
rot
and
the
young
sprigs
almost
budding
and
hissing
with
sap
and
for
one
moment
they
saw
all
the
skeleton
and
soul
of
the
castle
without
its
body
before
it
fell
in
the
child
sighed
a
little
and
yawned
a
little
and
said
how
nice
it
is
to
live
in
a
palace
who
lives
here
with
you
my
friends
said
young
gerard
poking
at
the
log
with
a
bit
of
stick
what
are
your
friends
like
she
asked
him
rubbing
her
knuckles
in
her
eyes
he
was
silent
for
a
little
stirring
up
sparks
and
smoke
then
he
answered
they
are
gay
in
their
hearts
and
they
dressed
in
bright
clothes
and
they
come
with
singing
and
dancing
who
else
lives
in
your
palace
with
you
she
asked
drowsily
you
do
said
young
gerard
the
child
head
dropped
against
his
shoulder
and
she
said
my
dorothea
but
my
father
calls
me
thea
and
he
is
the
lord
of
combe
ivy
and
she
fell
fast
asleep
for
a
little
while
young
gerard
held
and
watched
her
in
the
firelight
and
then
he
rose
and
wrapped
her
in
the
old
embroidered
mantle
on
the
settle
and
went
out
and
as
a
goat
he
carried
her
over
the
dark
hills
by
the
tracks
he
knew
for
roads
there
were
none
and
his
arms
ached
with
his
burden
but
he
would
not
wake
her
till
they
stood
at
her
father
gates
then
he
shook
her
gently
and
set
her
down
and
she
clung
to
him
a
little
dazed
trying
to
remember
this
is
combe
ivy
he
whispered
you
must
go
in
alone
will
you
come
again
one
day
said
thea
one
day
there
be
flowers
on
my
said
young
gerard
do
forget
no
i
wo
she
said
he
returned
through
the
night
up
hill
and
down
dale
but
did
not
go
back
to
the
shed
until
he
had
recovered
his
lamb
by
then
it
was
almost
dawn
and
he
found
his
master
awake
and
cursing
he
had
feared
the
boy
had
made
off
and
he
had
had
curt
treatment
at
combe
ivy
which
was
in
a
stir
about
the
loss
of
the
little
daughter
young
gerard
showed
the
lamb
as
his
excuse
nevertheless
the
old
shepherd
leathered
the
young
one
soundly
as
he
did
six
days
in
seven
after
this
when
young
gerard
sat
dreaming
on
the
hills
he
dreamed
not
only
of
his
happy
land
and
laughing
friends
but
of
the
next
coming
of
little
thea
but
combe
ivy
was
far
away
and
the
months
passed
and
the
years
and
she
did
not
come
again
meanwhile
young
gerard
and
his
tree
grew
apace
and
the
limbs
of
the
boy
became
longer
and
stronger
and
the
branches
of
the
tree
spread
up
to
the
roof
and
even
began
to
thrust
their
way
through
the
holes
in
the
wall
but
the
boy
life
save
for
his
dreaming
was
as
friendless
as
the
tree
was
flowerless
and
of
a
tree
dreaming
who
shall
speak
meanwhile
old
gerard
thrashed
and
rated
him
and
reckoned
his
gold
pieces
and
counted
the
years
that
still
lay
between
him
and
his
freedom
at
last
came
another
april
bringing
its
hour
for
as
he
sat
on
the
mount
in
the
early
morning
when
he
was
in
his
seventeenth
year
young
gerard
saw
a
slender
girl
running
over
the
turf
and
laughing
in
the
sunlight
sometimes
stopping
to
watch
a
bird
flying
or
stooping
to
pluck
one
of
the
tiny
at
her
feet
so
she
came
with
a
dancing
step
to
the
top
of
the
mount
and
then
she
saw
him
and
her
glee
left
her
and
shyness
took
its
place
but
a
little
pride
in
her
prevented
her
from
turning
away
and
she
still
came
forward
until
she
stood
beside
him
and
said
good
morning
shepherd
is
it
true
that
in
april
the
country
north
of
the
hills
is
filled
with
lakes
yes
sometimes
mistress
thea
said
young
gerard
she
looked
at
him
with
surprise
and
said
you
must
be
one
of
my
father
shepherds
but
i
do
not
remember
seeing
you
at
combe
ivy
i
was
only
once
near
combe
ivy
said
young
gerard
when
i
took
you
there
five
years
ago
the
night
you
were
lost
on
these
hills
oh
i
remember
she
said
with
a
faint
smile
how
they
did
scold
me
is
your
in
flower
yet
shepherd
no
mistress
said
young
gerard
i
want
to
see
it
she
said
suddenly
young
gerard
left
his
flock
to
the
dog
and
walked
with
her
along
the
hillbrow
i
have
run
away
she
told
him
as
they
went
i
had
to
get
up
very
early
while
they
were
asleep
i
shall
be
scolded
again
but
travelers
come
who
talk
of
the
lakes
and
i
wanted
to
see
them
and
to
swim
in
them
i
would
do
that
said
young
gerard
hiding
a
smile
dangerous
to
swim
in
the
april
floods
and
it
would
be
rather
cold
what
lies
beyond
she
asked
i
not
able
to
know
said
young
gerard
some
day
i
mean
to
know
shepherd
yes
mistress
he
said
you
be
free
to
she
looked
at
him
quickly
and
reddened
a
little
it
might
have
been
from
shame
or
pity
young
gerard
did
not
know
which
and
her
shyness
once
more
enveloped
her
it
always
came
over
her
unexpectedly
taking
her
breath
away
like
a
breaking
wave
so
she
said
no
more
and
they
walked
together
she
looking
at
the
ground
he
at
the
soft
brown
hair
blowing
over
the
curve
of
her
young
cheek
she
was
fine
and
delicate
in
every
line
and
in
her
color
and
in
the
touch
of
her
too
young
gerard
knew
he
wanted
to
touch
her
cheek
with
his
finger
as
he
would
have
touched
the
petal
of
a
flower
her
neck
the
back
of
it
especially
was
one
of
the
loveliest
bits
of
her
like
a
primrose
stalk
he
fell
a
step
behind
so
that
he
could
look
at
it
they
did
not
speak
as
they
went
he
did
not
want
to
and
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
when
they
reached
the
shed
she
lingered
a
moment
by
the
tree
tracing
a
bare
branch
with
her
finger
and
he
waited
content
till
she
should
speak
or
act
to
watch
her
at
last
she
said
with
her
faint
smile
i
am
very
thirsty
then
he
went
into
the
shed
and
came
out
with
his
wooden
cup
filled
with
milk
she
drank
and
said
thank
you
shepherd
how
pretty
the
violets
are
in
your
copse
would
you
like
some
he
asked
not
now
she
said
perhaps
another
day
i
must
go
now
she
gave
him
back
his
cup
and
went
away
slowly
at
first
but
when
she
was
at
some
distance
he
saw
her
begin
to
run
like
a
fawn
she
did
not
come
again
that
spring
and
so
the
stark
lives
of
the
boy
and
the
tree
went
forward
for
another
year
but
one
evening
in
the
following
april
when
the
green
was
quivering
on
wood
and
hedgerow
he
came
to
the
door
of
the
shed
and
saw
her
bending
like
a
flower
at
the
edge
of
the
copse
filling
her
little
basket
and
singing
to
herself
she
looked
up
soon
and
said
good
evening
shepherd
how
does
your
as
usual
mistress
thea
so
i
see
what
a
lazy
tree
it
is
have
you
some
milk
for
me
he
brought
her
his
cup
and
she
drank
of
it
for
the
third
time
and
left
him
before
he
had
had
time
to
realize
that
she
had
come
and
gone
but
only
how
greatly
her
delicate
beauty
had
increased
in
the
last
year
however
before
the
summer
was
over
she
came
again
to
swim
in
the
river
she
told
him
as
she
passed
him
on
the
hills
without
lingering
and
in
the
autumn
she
came
to
gather
blackberries
and
he
showed
her
the
best
place
to
find
them
any
of
these
things
she
might
have
done
as
easily
nearer
combe
ivy
but
it
seemed
she
must
always
offer
him
some
reason
for
her
small
truancies
whether
to
gather
berries
or
flowers
or
to
swim
in
the
river
he
knew
that
her
chief
delight
lay
in
escaping
from
her
father
manor
winter
closed
her
visits
but
young
gerard
was
as
patient
as
the
earth
and
did
not
begin
to
look
for
her
till
april
as
surely
as
it
brought
leaves
to
the
trees
and
flowers
to
the
grass
it
would
he
knew
bring
his
little
mistress
question
half
shy
half
smiling
is
your
in
blossom
shepherd
and
later
her
request
smiling
and
shy
for
milk
they
seldom
exchanged
more
than
a
few
words
at
any
time
sometimes
they
did
not
speak
at
all
for
he
who
was
her
father
servant
never
spoke
first
and
she
growing
in
years
and
loveliness
grew
also
in
timidity
so
that
it
seemed
to
cost
her
more
and
more
to
address
her
greeting
or
her
question
even
to
her
father
servant
the
sweet
quick
reddening
of
her
cheek
was
one
of
young
gerard
chief
remembrances
of
her
but
after
a
while
when
they
met
by
those
sly
chances
which
she
could
control
and
he
could
not
and
when
she
did
not
speak
but
glanced
and
hesitated
and
passed
on
or
glanced
and
passed
without
hesitation
or
passed
without
a
glance
he
came
to
know
that
she
would
not
mind
if
he
arose
and
walked
with
her
if
he
could
control
the
pretext
which
she
could
not
and
he
did
so
quietly
having
always
something
to
show
her
he
showed
her
his
most
secret
nests
and
his
greatest
treasures
of
flowers
his
because
he
loved
them
so
much
he
would
have
been
jealous
of
showing
these
things
to
any
one
but
her
in
a
great
in
the
valley
he
had
once
shown
her
kingcups
making
sheets
of
gold
enameled
with
every
green
grass
ever
seen
in
spring
thousands
of
kingcups
and
a
myriad
of
milkmaids
in
between
dancing
attendance
in
all
their
faint
shades
of
and
when
a
breeze
blew
this
world
of
milkmaids
swayed
and
curtsied
above
the
daughters
in
their
glory
then
gerard
and
thea
looked
at
each
other
smiling
because
the
same
delight
was
in
each
and
soon
she
looked
away
again
at
the
gentle
maids
and
the
royal
ladies
but
he
looked
still
at
her
who
was
both
to
him
in
silence
he
showed
her
what
he
loved
but
you
must
not
suppose
that
she
came
frequently
to
those
hills
she
was
to
be
seen
no
more
often
than
you
will
see
a
kingfisher
when
you
watch
for
it
under
a
willow
yet
because
in
the
season
of
kingfishers
you
know
you
may
see
one
flash
at
any
instant
so
to
young
gerard
each
day
of
spring
and
summer
was
an
expectancy
and
this
it
was
that
kept
his
lift
alight
this
and
his
young
troop
of
friends
in
a
land
of
fruit
in
blossom
and
a
sky
in
stars
for
men
dear
maids
live
by
the
daily
bread
of
their
dreams
on
realizations
they
would
starve
at
last
came
the
winter
that
preceded
young
gerard
year
with
the
stripping
of
the
boughs
he
stripped
his
heart
of
all
thoughts
of
seeing
her
again
till
the
green
of
the
coming
year
the
snows
came
and
he
tended
his
sheep
and
counted
his
memories
and
old
gerard
tended
his
sheep
and
counted
his
coins
the
count
was
full
now
and
he
dreamed
of
april
and
the
freeing
of
his
body
young
gerard
also
dreamed
of
april
and
the
freeing
of
his
heart
and
under
the
ice
that
bound
the
flooded
meadows
doubtless
the
earth
dreamed
of
the
freeing
of
her
waters
and
the
blooming
of
the
land
the
snows
and
the
frosts
lasted
late
that
year
as
though
the
winter
would
never
be
done
and
to
the
two
gerards
the
days
crawled
like
snails
but
in
time
march
blew
himself
off
the
face
of
the
earth
and
april
dawned
and
the
swollen
river
went
rushing
to
the
sea
above
the
banks
it
had
drowned
with
its
wild
overflow
and
as
old
gerard
began
to
mark
the
days
off
on
a
tally
young
gerard
began
to
listen
on
the
hills
when
the
day
came
whose
midnight
was
to
make
the
old
man
a
freedman
thea
had
not
appeared
on
the
morning
of
this
day
as
the
two
shepherds
stood
outside
their
shed
before
they
separated
with
their
flocks
their
ears
were
accosted
with
shoutings
and
halloos
on
the
other
side
of
the
copse
and
soon
they
saw
coming
through
the
trees
a
man
in
gay
attire
he
had
a
scalloped
jerkin
of
orange
leather
and
his
shoes
and
cap
were
of
the
same
but
his
sleeves
and
hose
and
feather
were
of
a
vivid
green
like
nothing
in
nature
he
looked
garish
in
the
sun
seeing
the
shepherds
he
took
off
his
cap
and
solemnly
thanked
heaven
for
having
after
all
created
something
besides
hills
and
valleys
for
said
he
after
being
lost
among
them
i
know
not
how
many
hours
with
no
other
company
than
my
own
shadow
i
had
begun
to
doubt
whether
i
was
not
the
only
man
on
earth
and
my
name
adam
a
curse
of
all
lords
who
do
not
live
by
highroads
where
are
you
bound
for
master
asked
old
gerard
combe
ivy
said
the
stranger
and
the
wedding
old
gerard
nodded
as
one
little
surprised
but
to
young
gerard
this
mention
of
a
wedding
at
combe
ivy
came
as
news
it
did
not
stir
him
much
however
for
he
was
not
curious
about
the
doings
of
the
master
and
the
house
he
never
saw
all
that
concerned
him
was
that
at
least
he
must
cease
to
listen
on
the
hills
since
his
young
mistress
would
be
at
the
wedding
with
the
others
old
gerard
said
to
the
stranger
keep
the
straight
track
to
the
south
till
you
come
under
wepham
then
follow
the
valley
to
the
east
and
so
you
be
in
time
for
the
feasting
master
that
certain
said
the
stranger
for
the
lord
of
combe
ivy
and
the
rough
master
of
coates
have
had
no
peers
at
junketing
since
gay
street
lost
its
lord
and
the
feast
is
like
to
go
on
till
midnight
with
that
he
went
on
his
way
and
old
gerard
followed
him
with
his
eyes
muttering
would
i
also
were
there
but
for
you
he
said
turning
on
the
young
man
with
a
sudden
snarl
i
should
be
had
ye
not
come
a
day
too
late
i
be
a
freedman
instead
of
and
junketing
at
the
wedding
with
the
rest
young
gerard
did
not
understand
him
he
was
not
in
the
habit
of
questioning
the
old
man
and
if
he
had
would
not
have
expected
answers
but
certain
words
of
the
stranger
had
pricked
his
attention
and
now
he
said
where
is
gay
street
far
away
over
the
stor
and
the
chill
growled
old
gerard
it
a
jolly
name
maybe
but
they
say
it
a
sorry
place
now
that
it
lacks
its
lord
what
became
of
him
how
should
i
know
what
can
a
man
know
who
lives
all
his
life
on
a
hill
with
pewits
for
gossips
you
know
more
than
i
said
young
gerard
indolently
you
know
a
wedding
down
yonder
who
the
rough
master
of
coates
the
bridegroom
young
you
a
tongue
in
your
head
why
do
they
call
him
the
rough
master
because
that
what
he
is
and
so
are
his
people
as
rough
as
furze
on
a
common
they
say
have
you
any
more
questions
yes
said
young
gerard
who
is
the
bride
who
should
the
bride
be
combe
ivy
mother
she
dead
said
young
gerard
his
daughter
then
scoffed
old
gerard
young
gerard
stared
at
him
get
about
your
business
shouted
the
old
shepherd
with
sudden
wrath
why
do
ye
stare
so
you
not
drunk
ah
down
yonder
they
be
getting
drunk
without
me
enough
of
your
idling
and
staring
he
raised
his
staff
but
young
gerard
thrust
it
aside
so
violently
that
he
staggered
and
the
boy
went
away
to
his
sheep
and
they
met
no
more
till
evening
the
whole
of
that
day
young
gerard
sat
on
the
mount
not
looking
as
usual
to
the
busy
north
dreaming
of
the
unknown
land
beyond
the
water
but
over
the
silent
slopes
and
valleys
of
the
south
whose
peoples
were
only
birds
and
foxes
and
rabbits
and
whose
only
cities
were
built
of
lights
and
shadows
somewhere
beyond
them
was
combe
ivy
and
little
thea
getting
married
to
the
rough
master
of
coates
in
the
midst
of
feasting
and
singing
and
dancing
he
thought
of
her
dancing
over
the
downs
for
joy
of
being
free
he
thought
of
her
singing
to
herself
as
she
gathered
flowers
in
his
copse
and
he
thought
of
her
feasting
on
wild
berries
he
had
helped
her
to
find
that
also
was
a
feasting
and
singing
and
dancing
all
day
long
his
thoughts
ran
she
will
not
come
any
more
in
the
mornings
to
bathe
in
the
river
over
the
hill
she
will
not
come
with
her
little
basket
to
gather
flowers
and
berries
she
will
not
stop
and
ask
for
a
cup
of
milk
or
say
let
me
see
the
young
lambs
or
say
is
your
in
flower
yet
shepherd
she
will
not
ask
me
with
her
eyes
to
come
with
her
oh
she
will
not
ask
me
by
turning
her
eyes
away
with
her
little
head
bent
you
you
rough
master
of
coates
what
are
you
like
what
are
you
like
in
the
evening
when
he
gathered
his
sheep
one
was
missing
he
had
to
take
the
flock
back
without
it
old
gerard
was
furious
with
him
it
seemed
as
though
on
this
last
night
that
separated
him
from
the
long
fulfillment
of
his
hopes
he
must
be
more
furious
than
he
had
ever
been
before
he
was
furious
at
being
thwarted
of
the
fun
in
the
valley
furious
at
the
loss
of
the
lamb
most
furious
at
young
indifference
to
his
fury
he
told
the
boy
he
must
search
on
the
hills
and
young
gerard
only
sat
down
by
the
side
of
the
shed
and
looked
to
the
south
and
made
no
answer
so
he
went
himself
leaving
the
boy
to
prepare
the
mess
for
supper
for
he
feared
that
if
he
went
to
combe
ivy
that
night
with
a
bad
tale
to
tell
his
master
for
a
whim
might
say
that
a
young
sheep
was
a
fair
deal
for
an
old
shepherd
and
take
his
gold
and
keep
him
a
bondman
still
for
the
lord
of
combe
ivy
lived
by
his
whimsies
but
old
gerard
could
not
find
the
lost
sheep
and
when
he
came
back
the
boy
was
where
he
had
left
him
looking
over
the
darkening
hills
is
the
mess
ready
said
old
gerard
no
said
young
gerard
why
not
because
i
forgot
old
gerard
slashed
at
him
with
a
rope
he
had
taken
in
case
of
need
that
will
make
you
remember
no
said
young
gerard
why
not
young
gerard
said
you
beat
me
too
often
i
can
not
remember
all
the
reasons
then
said
old
gerard
full
of
wrath
i
will
beat
you
out
of
all
reason
and
he
began
to
thrash
young
gerard
will
all
his
might
talking
between
the
blows
have
you
been
the
curse
of
my
life
for
years
snarled
he
can
i
trust
you
can
i
leave
you
would
the
sheep
get
their
straw
would
the
lambs
be
brought
alive
into
the
world
bah
for
all
you
care
the
sheep
would
go
cold
and
their
young
would
die
and
down
yonder
they
are
getting
drunk
without
me
old
shepherd
said
a
voice
behind
him
the
angry
man
panting
with
his
rage
and
the
exertion
of
his
blows
paused
and
turned
near
the
corner
of
the
shed
he
saw
a
woman
in
a
duffle
cloak
standing
or
rather
stooping
on
her
crutch
she
was
so
ancient
that
it
seemed
as
though
death
himself
must
have
forgotten
her
but
her
eyes
in
their
wrinkled
sockets
were
as
piercing
as
thorns
old
gerard
staring
at
them
felt
as
though
his
own
eyes
were
pricked
where
have
i
seen
you
before
hag
he
said
have
you
ever
seen
me
before
asked
the
old
woman
i
thought
so
i
thought
so
he
fumbled
with
his
memory
then
it
must
have
been
when
we
went
courting
in
april
years
ago
said
the
old
woman
dryly
but
you
lads
remember
me
better
than
i
do
you
can
i
sleep
by
your
hearth
where
are
you
going
to
asked
old
gerard
half
grinning
half
sour
where
i
be
welcome
said
she
you
not
welcome
here
but
there
nothing
to
steal
you
may
sleep
by
the
hearth
thank
you
shepherd
said
the
crone
for
your
courtesy
why
were
you
beating
the
boy
because
he
one
that
wo
work
is
he
your
slave
he
my
master
slave
but
he
idle
i
am
not
idle
said
young
gerard
the
year
round
i
busy
long
before
dawn
and
long
after
dark
then
why
are
you
idle
sneered
old
gerard
of
all
the
days
in
the
year
i
something
else
to
think
of
said
the
boy
you
see
said
the
old
man
to
the
crone
well
said
she
a
boy
can
not
always
be
working
a
boy
will
sometimes
be
dreaming
life
is
all
labor
shepherd
what
else
is
it
said
old
gerard
joy
ho
ho
ho
went
old
gerard
and
power
ho
ho
ho
and
triumph
not
for
serfs
said
old
gerard
for
serfs
and
lords
she
said
ho
ho
ho
you
were
young
once
said
the
crone
old
gerard
said
what
if
i
was
good
night
said
the
crone
and
she
went
into
the
shed
the
shepherds
looked
after
her
the
old
one
stupidly
the
young
one
with
lighted
eyes
will
you
get
supper
growled
old
gerard
no
said
young
gerard
i
wo
i
want
no
supper
put
down
that
rope
i
am
taller
and
stronger
than
you
and
why
i
let
you
go
on
beating
me
so
long
i
do
know
unless
it
is
that
you
began
to
beat
me
when
you
were
taller
and
stronger
than
i
if
you
want
any
supper
get
it
yourself
old
gerard
turned
red
and
purple
the
boy
mad
he
gasped
do
you
know
what
happens
to
servants
who
defy
their
masters
yes
said
young
gerard
then
they
lords
and
he
too
went
into
the
shed
try
that
on
combe
ivy
bawled
old
gerard
and
see
what
you
get
for
it
i
thank
fortune
i
be
quit
of
you
tomorrow
what
that
in
the
valley
he
muttered
and
stared
down
the
hill
away
in
the
hollows
and
shadows
he
saw
splashes
of
moving
light
and
heard
snatches
of
song
and
laughter
but
the
movements
and
sounds
were
still
so
distant
that
they
seemed
to
be
only
those
of
ghosts
and
echoes
nearer
they
came
and
nearer
and
now
in
the
night
he
could
discern
a
great
rabble
stumbling
among
the
dips
and
rises
of
the
hills
they
heading
this
way
said
old
gerard
why
tis
the
he
said
amazed
if
it
not
witchcraft
but
why
are
they
coming
here
hola
hola
hola
shouted
a
tipsy
voice
hard
by
here
dribblings
from
the
wineskin
said
old
gerard
and
up
the
track
struggled
a
drunken
man
waving
a
torch
above
his
head
it
was
the
guest
whom
he
had
directed
in
the
morning
hola
he
shouted
again
on
seeing
old
gerard
well
racketer
said
the
shepherd
with
a
chuckle
shall
a
man
not
racket
at
another
man
wedding
he
cried
let
some
one
be
jolly
say
i
the
bridegroom
said
old
gerard
ha
ha
laughed
the
other
the
bridegroom
he
was
first
in
high
feather
and
last
in
the
sulks
the
bride
then
ha
ha
ha
ha
during
the
toasts
he
tried
to
kiss
her
would
she
she
would
hark
said
old
gerard
here
they
come
the
sound
of
rollicking
increased
as
the
rout
drew
nearer
he
taking
her
home
across
the
river
said
the
guest
i
would
be
she
there
she
sat
her
pretty
face
fixed
and
frozen
but
a
fright
in
her
that
shook
her
whole
body
you
could
see
it
shake
and
we
drank
how
we
drank
to
the
bride
and
the
groom
and
their
daughters
and
sons
to
the
sire
and
the
priest
and
the
ring
and
the
bed
to
the
kiss
and
the
quarrel
to
love
which
is
one
thing
and
marriage
which
is
another
lord
how
we
drank
but
she
drank
nothing
and
for
all
her
terror
the
rough
could
do
no
more
with
her
than
with
a
stone
something
in
her
turned
him
cold
every
time
suddenly
up
he
gets
we
have
no
more
of
this
he
says
we
go
combe
ivy
would
have
had
them
stay
but
she
where
she
used
to
lord
it
here
says
rough
i
take
her
where
i
lord
it
and
teach
her
who
master
and
he
pushes
down
his
chair
and
takes
her
hand
and
pulls
her
away
and
out
we
tumble
after
him
combe
ivy
cries
to
him
to
wait
for
the
horses
but
no
we
foot
it
says
he
up
hill
and
down
dale
as
the
crow
flies
and
if
she
hates
me
now
without
a
cause
i
swear
she
love
me
with
one
at
the
end
of
the
dance
we
dancing
them
as
far
as
the
wildbrooks
on
side
they
may
dance
for
themselves
here
they
come
dancing
dance
you
cried
the
guest
and
whirled
his
torch
like
a
madman
and
as
he
whirled
and
staggered
up
the
hill
came
the
as
tipsy
as
he
was
a
motley
procession
waving
torches
and
garlands
winecups
flagons
colored
napkins
shouting
and
singing
and
beating
on
trenchers
and
salvers
on
anything
that
they
could
snatch
from
the
table
as
they
quitted
it
they
came
in
all
their
bravery
in
doublets
of
silk
and
blue
in
scarlet
leather
and
green
velvet
in
purple
slashed
with
silver
and
crimson
fringed
with
bronze
but
their
vests
were
unlaced
their
hose
sagged
and
silk
and
velvet
and
leather
were
stained
bright
or
dark
with
wine
some
had
stuck
leaves
and
flowers
in
their
hair
others
had
tied
their
forelocks
with
ribbons
like
horses
on
a
holiday
and
one
had
torn
his
yellow
mantle
in
two
and
capered
in
advance
waving
the
halves
in
either
hand
like
monstrous
banners
or
the
flapping
wings
of
some
golden
bird
of
prey
in
the
midst
of
them
pressing
forward
and
pressed
on
by
the
riot
behind
was
the
rough
master
of
coates
and
with
him
always
hanging
a
little
away
and
shrinking
under
her
veil
thea
whose
right
wrist
he
grasped
in
his
left
hand
breathless
she
was
among
the
breathless
rabble
who
gaining
the
hilltop
seized
each
other
suddenly
and
broke
into
antics
shaking
their
napkins
and
rattling
on
their
plates
their
voices
were
hoarse
with
laughter
and
drink
and
their
faces
flushed
with
it
only
among
those
red
and
swollen
faces
the
bridegroom
in
the
flare
of
the
torches
looked
as
black
as
the
bride
looked
white
the
night
about
the
pair
was
one
great
din
and
flutter
then
in
a
trice
the
dancers
all
lost
breath
and
the
dance
parted
as
they
staggered
aside
and
at
the
door
of
the
shed
young
gerard
stood
and
gazed
through
the
broken
revel
at
little
thea
and
she
stood
gazing
at
him
and
behind
and
above
him
along
the
walls
of
the
hut
and
over
the
doorway
and
making
lovely
the
very
roof
she
saw
a
cloud
of
snowwhite
blossom
somebody
cried
here
a
boy
he
shall
dance
too
boy
is
there
drink
within
the
others
took
up
the
clamor
drink
bring
us
something
to
drink
the
red
grape
cried
one
the
yellow
grape
cried
another
the
sap
of
the
apple
the
juice
of
the
pear
ale
the
spirit
that
burns
bring
us
drink
they
cried
in
a
breath
will
you
have
milk
said
young
gerard
at
this
the
company
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
they
laughed
till
they
rocked
but
when
they
were
silent
little
thea
spoke
she
said
in
a
faint
clear
voice
i
would
like
a
cup
of
milk
young
gerard
went
into
the
hut
and
came
out
with
his
wooden
cup
filled
with
milk
and
brought
it
to
her
and
she
drank
none
spoke
or
moved
while
she
drank
but
when
she
gave
him
the
cup
again
one
of
the
crew
said
chuckling
now
she
has
drunk
now
she
merrier
try
her
again
rough
try
her
on
milk
again
the
night
reeled
with
their
laughter
they
surrounded
the
wedded
pair
crying
kiss
her
kiss
her
kiss
her
then
the
rough
master
of
coates
pulled
her
round
to
him
dark
with
anger
and
tried
to
kiss
her
but
she
turned
sharply
in
his
arms
bending
her
head
away
and
despite
his
force
and
though
he
was
a
man
and
she
little
more
than
a
child
he
could
not
make
her
mouth
meet
his
and
the
laughter
of
the
guests
rose
higher
and
infuriated
him
then
he
who
had
spoken
before
said
by
hymen
the
bride
should
kiss
something
if
the
lord
not
good
enough
let
her
kiss
the
churl
at
this
the
revelers
wild
with
delight
beat
on
their
trenchers
and
shouted
ay
let
her
and
suddenly
they
surged
in
parting
thea
from
the
rough
while
some
pulled
him
back
others
dragged
young
gerard
forward
till
he
stood
where
the
bridegroom
had
stood
and
in
that
seething
throng
of
mockery
he
felt
her
clinging
helplessly
to
him
and
his
arm
went
round
her
kiss
him
kiss
him
kiss
him
cried
the
guests
she
looked
up
pitifully
at
him
and
he
bent
his
head
and
she
heard
him
whisper
my
in
flower
she
whispered
yes
and
they
kissed
each
other
then
the
tumult
of
laughter
passed
all
bounds
so
that
it
was
a
wonder
if
it
was
not
heard
at
combe
ivy
and
the
guests
clashed
their
trenchers
one
against
another
and
whirled
their
torches
till
the
sparks
flew
yelling
the
bride
kiss
ha
ha
the
bride
kiss
but
the
rough
master
of
coates
had
had
enough
snarling
like
a
mad
dog
he
thrust
his
way
through
the
crowd
on
one
side
as
old
gerard
seeing
his
purpose
thrust
through
on
the
other
and
both
at
the
same
instant
fell
on
the
boy
the
one
with
his
scabbard
the
other
with
his
staff
kisses
will
ye
cried
the
rough
master
of
coates
here
kisses
for
ye
ha
ha
cried
the
guests
more
kisses
more
kisses
for
him
that
kissed
the
bride
and
then
they
all
struck
him
at
once
kicking
and
beating
him
without
mercy
till
he
lay
prone
on
the
earth
when
he
had
fallen
the
rough
shouted
away
to
the
wildbrooks
away
and
he
seized
thea
in
his
arms
and
rushed
along
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
all
the
company
followed
in
a
confusion
and
were
swallowed
up
in
the
night
but
young
gerard
raised
himself
a
little
and
groaned
the
wildbrooks
are
they
going
to
the
wildbrooks
ay
and
over
the
wildbrooks
said
old
gerard
but
they
in
flood
gasped
young
gerard
they
never
cross
it
in
the
spring
floods
they
manage
it
somehow
the
rough
did
you
see
his
eyes
when
you
ho
ho
he
cross
it
somehow
he
ca
the
boy
muttered
the
april
tide
too
strong
he
will
drown
in
the
flood
and
she
said
old
gerard
perhaps
she
will
swim
on
the
flood
said
young
gerard
faintly
and
he
sighed
and
sank
back
on
the
earth
ay
you
be
sore
chuckled
the
old
man
you
had
your
salve
before
you
had
your
drubbing
lie
there
i
must
be
gone
on
business
he
took
up
his
staff
and
went
down
the
hill
for
the
last
time
to
combe
ivy
to
purchase
his
freedom
but
young
gerard
lay
with
his
face
pressed
to
the
turf
and
that
was
the
bridegroom
he
said
and
shook
where
he
lay
young
shepherd
said
a
voice
beside
him
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
hooded
crone
come
out
of
the
hut
why
do
you
water
the
earth
said
she
have
not
the
rains
done
their
work
what
work
dame
you
as
fine
a
cherry
in
flower
said
she
as
ever
blossomed
in
gay
street
in
the
season
of
singing
and
dancing
singing
and
dancing
he
cried
his
voice
choking
and
he
sprang
up
despite
his
pains
do
speak
to
me
dame
of
singing
and
dancing
you
old
like
the
withered
branch
of
a
tree
but
did
you
not
see
with
your
old
eyes
and
hear
with
your
old
ears
did
you
not
see
her
come
up
the
green
hillside
with
singing
and
dancing
oh
yes
my
cherry
in
flower
like
a
crown
for
a
bride
and
the
spring
is
all
in
movement
and
the
birds
are
all
in
song
and
she
she
came
up
the
hillside
with
singing
and
dancing
i
saw
said
the
crone
and
i
heard
i
not
so
old
young
shepherd
that
i
do
not
remember
the
curse
of
youth
what
that
he
said
moodily
to
bear
the
soul
of
a
master
in
the
body
of
a
slave
said
she
to
be
a
flower
in
a
sealed
bud
the
moon
in
a
cloud
water
locked
in
ice
spring
in
the
womb
of
the
year
love
that
does
not
know
itself
but
when
it
does
know
said
young
gerard
slowly
oh
when
it
knows
said
she
then
the
flower
of
the
fruit
will
leap
through
the
bud
and
the
moon
will
leap
like
a
lamb
on
the
hills
of
the
sky
and
april
will
leap
in
the
veins
of
the
year
and
the
river
will
leap
with
the
fury
of
spring
and
the
headlong
heart
will
cry
in
the
body
of
youth
i
will
not
be
a
slave
but
i
will
be
the
lord
of
life
because
because
said
young
gerard
because
i
will
young
gerard
said
nothing
and
they
sat
together
in
a
long
silence
in
the
darkness
and
time
went
by
filling
the
sky
with
stars
now
as
they
sat
the
hilltop
once
more
began
to
waver
with
shadows
and
voices
but
this
time
the
shadows
came
on
heavy
feet
and
weary
and
the
voices
were
forlorn
one
feebly
cried
hola
and
round
the
belt
of
trees
straggled
the
rout
that
had
left
them
an
hour
or
so
earlier
but
now
they
were
sodden
and
dejected
draggled
and
woebegone
as
sorry
a
spectacle
as
so
many
drowned
rats
fire
moaned
one
fire
fire
who
burning
said
young
gerard
and
got
quickly
on
his
feet
but
he
did
not
see
the
two
he
looked
for
none
burning
fool
but
many
are
drowning
do
we
not
look
like
drowned
men
how
shall
we
ever
get
back
to
combe
ivy
and
warmth
and
drink
and
comforts
would
we
were
burning
what
has
happened
the
boy
demanded
we
went
in
search
of
the
ferry
he
said
but
the
ferry
was
drowned
too
we
could
find
the
ferry
said
a
second
no
mumbled
a
third
the
river
had
drunk
it
up
where
there
were
paths
there
are
brooks
and
where
there
were
meadows
lakes
the
miserable
crew
broke
out
into
plaints
and
questions
have
you
no
fire
have
you
no
food
no
coverings
none
said
young
gerard
where
is
the
bride
have
you
do
drink
where
is
the
bride
the
groom
stumbled
said
one
let
us
to
combe
ivy
in
name
there
be
drink
there
he
staggered
down
the
hill
and
his
fellows
made
after
him
but
young
gerard
sprang
upon
one
and
gripped
him
by
the
shoulder
and
shook
him
and
for
the
third
time
cried
where
is
the
bride
in
the
water
he
answered
heavily
because
there
was
no
wine
then
he
dragged
himself
out
of
the
boy
grasp
and
fell
down
the
hill
after
his
companions
young
gerard
stood
for
one
instant
listening
and
holding
his
breath
suddenly
he
said
my
lost
lamb
crying
on
the
hills
he
ran
into
the
shed
and
looked
about
and
snatched
from
the
settle
the
green
and
cherry
cloak
and
from
the
wall
the
crystal
and
silver
lantern
he
struck
a
spark
from
a
flint
and
lit
the
wick
it
burned
brightly
and
steadily
then
he
ran
out
of
the
shed
the
old
woman
rose
up
in
his
path
that
a
good
light
said
she
and
a
warm
cloak
do
stop
me
said
young
gerard
and
ran
on
she
nodded
and
as
he
vanished
in
one
direction
she
vanished
in
the
other
he
had
not
run
far
when
he
saw
one
more
shadow
on
the
hills
and
it
came
with
faltering
steps
and
a
trembling
sobbing
breath
and
he
held
up
his
lantern
and
the
light
fell
on
thea
shivering
in
her
wet
veil
as
the
flame
struck
her
eyes
she
sighed
oh
i
ca
see
the
way
i
ca
see
young
gerard
hurried
to
her
and
said
come
this
way
and
he
took
her
hand
but
she
snatched
it
quickly
from
him
go
man
she
said
do
touch
me
go
do
be
frightened
of
me
said
young
gerard
gently
then
she
looked
at
him
and
whispered
oh
it
is
you
shepherd
i
was
trying
to
find
you
i
cold
young
gerard
wrapped
the
cloak
about
her
and
said
come
with
me
make
you
a
fire
he
took
her
back
to
the
shed
but
she
did
not
go
in
she
crouched
on
the
ground
under
the
young
gerard
moved
about
collecting
brushwood
they
scarcely
looked
at
each
other
but
once
when
he
passed
her
he
said
you
shivering
it
because
i
so
wet
said
thea
did
you
fall
in
the
water
she
nodded
the
floods
were
so
strong
it
a
bad
night
for
swimming
said
young
gerard
yes
shepherd
she
then
said
again
yes
he
could
tell
by
her
voice
that
she
was
smiling
faintly
he
glanced
at
her
and
saw
her
looking
at
him
both
smiled
a
little
and
glanced
away
again
he
began
to
pile
his
brushwood
for
the
fire
after
a
short
pause
she
said
timidly
are
you
sore
shepherd
no
i
feel
nothing
said
he
they
beat
you
very
hard
i
did
not
feel
their
blows
how
could
you
not
feel
them
she
said
in
a
low
voice
he
looked
at
her
again
and
again
their
eyes
met
and
again
parted
quickly
now
i
strike
a
spark
said
young
gerard
and
you
be
warm
soon
he
kindled
his
fire
the
branches
crackled
and
burned
and
she
knelt
beside
the
blaze
and
held
her
hands
to
it
i
was
never
here
by
night
before
she
said
yes
once
said
young
gerard
you
often
came
did
you
to
gather
flowers
in
the
morning
and
to
swim
in
the
river
at
noon
but
once
before
you
were
here
in
the
night
was
i
said
she
he
dropped
a
handful
of
cones
into
her
lap
throwing
the
last
on
the
fire
she
threw
another
after
it
and
smiled
as
it
crackled
i
remember
she
said
thank
you
shepherd
you
were
always
kind
and
found
me
the
things
i
wanted
and
gave
me
your
cup
to
drink
of
drink
of
it
now
no
one
he
said
ever
again
he
went
and
fetched
the
cup
and
gave
it
to
her
burn
that
too
said
young
gerard
thea
put
it
into
the
fire
and
trembled
when
it
was
burned
she
asked
very
low
will
you
be
lonely
i
have
my
sheep
and
my
thoughts
yes
said
thea
and
stars
when
the
sheep
are
folded
the
stars
are
good
to
be
with
too
good
to
see
and
not
be
seen
by
he
said
how
do
you
know
they
do
see
you
she
asked
shyly
one
shepherd
on
a
hill
is
much
for
the
eye
of
a
star
he
may
watch
them
unwatched
while
they
come
and
go
in
their
months
sometimes
there
are
any
and
sometimes
not
more
than
one
pricking
the
sky
near
the
moon
but
look
the
sky
like
a
tree
with
full
branches
thea
looked
up
and
said
with
a
child
laugh
break
me
a
branch
i
want
jacob
ladder
for
that
smiled
young
gerard
then
shake
the
tree
and
bring
them
down
she
insisted
here
come
your
stars
said
young
gerard
suddenly
she
was
enveloped
in
a
falling
shower
white
and
heavenly
the
stars
she
cried
oh
what
is
it
my
it
in
flower
said
young
gerard
and
his
voice
trembled
she
looked
up
quickly
and
saw
that
he
was
standing
beside
her
shaking
the
tree
above
her
head
and
now
their
eyes
met
and
did
not
separate
he
put
out
his
hand
and
broke
a
branch
from
the
tree
and
offered
it
to
her
she
took
it
from
him
slowly
as
though
she
were
in
a
dream
and
laid
it
in
her
lap
and
put
her
face
in
her
hands
and
began
to
cry
young
gerard
whispered
why
are
you
crying
thea
said
oh
my
wedding
my
wedding
only
last
year
i
thought
of
the
night
of
my
wedding
and
how
it
would
be
it
was
not
with
torchlight
and
shouting
and
wine
but
moonlight
and
silence
and
the
scent
of
wild
blossoms
and
now
i
know
that
it
was
not
the
night
of
my
wedding
i
dreamed
of
what
did
you
dream
of
asked
young
gerard
the
night
of
my
first
love
thea
said
young
gerard
and
he
knelt
beside
her
and
my
love
first
kiss
oh
thea
said
young
gerard
and
he
took
her
hands
why
did
you
not
feel
their
blows
she
said
i
felt
them
their
arms
went
round
each
other
and
for
the
second
time
that
night
they
kissed
young
gerard
said
i
always
wondered
if
this
would
happen
and
thea
answered
i
did
know
it
would
be
you
did
you
did
you
he
whispered
stroking
her
head
wondering
at
himself
doing
what
he
had
so
often
dreamed
of
doing
oh
she
faltered
sometimes
i
thought
it
might
be
you
darling
thea
thea
when
i
came
over
the
mount
to
swim
in
the
river
and
saw
you
in
the
distance
among
your
sheep
there
was
a
swifter
river
running
through
all
my
body
when
i
came
every
april
to
ask
for
your
what
did
it
matter
to
me
that
it
was
not
in
bloom
for
all
my
heart
was
wild
with
bloom
oh
gerard
my
lover
oh
thea
my
love
what

i
give
you
thea
i
a
shepherd

the
lord
of
the
earth
and
you
gave
me
its
flowers
and
its
birds
and
its
secret
waters
what
more
could
you
give
me
you
a
shepherd
and
my
lord

wild
white
bloom
of
its
that

to
the
branches
in

heart

give

bower
of

carpet

in
all
april
lovely
and
wild
enough
for
you
your
bridal
night
my
lady
and
my
darling
and
in
a
great
fit
of
joy
he
broke
branch
after
branch
from
the
tree
as
she
sat
at
its
foot
and
set
them
about
her
and
filled
her
arms
to
overflowing
and
crowned
her
with
blossoms
and
shook
the
bloom
under
her
feet
till
her
shy
happy
face
paling
and
reddening
by
turns
looked
out
from
a
world
of
flowers
and
she
cried
between
laughing
and
weeping
oh
gerard
oh
you
drowning
me
it
the
april
floods
shouted
young
gerard
and
i
must
drown
with
you
thea
thea
thea
and
he
cast
himself
down
beside
her
and
clasped
her
amid
all
the
blossoming
and
with
his
head
on
her
shoulder
kissed
and
kissed
her
till
he
was
breathless
and
she
as
pale
as
the
flowers
that
smothered
their
kisses
and
then
suddenly
he
folded
her
in
the
green
mantle
blossoms
and
all
and
sprang
up
and
lifted
her
to
his
breast
till
she
lay
like
a
child
in
the
arms
of
its
mother
and
he
picked
up
the
lantern
and
said
now
we
will
go
away
for
ever
where
are
we
going
she
whispered
with
shining
eyes
to
the
wildbrooks
he
said
to
drown
in
the
floods
together
she
closed
her
eyes
there
a
way
through
all
floods
said
young
gerard
and
he
ran
with
her
over
the
hills
with
all
his
speed
and
old
gerard
returned
to
a
hut
as
empty
as
it
had
been
years
ago
and
they
say
that
combe
ivy
having
never
set
eyes
on
the
boy
in
his
life
swore
that
the
shepherd
tale
had
been
a
fiction
from
first
to
last
and
kept
him
a
serf
to
the
end
of
his
days
what
a
night
of
stars
it
is
said
martin
pippin
stretching
his
arms
good
heavens
master
pippin
cried
joyce
what
a
moment
to
mention
it
it
is
worth
mentioning
said
martin
at
all
moments
when
it
is
so
i
would
not
think
of
mentioning
it
in
the
middle
of
a
snowstorm
you
should
as
little
think
of
mentioning
it
said
joyce
in
the
middle
of
a
story
but
i
am
at
the
end
of
my
story
mistress
joyce
joscelyn
preposterous
oh

can
you
say
so
i
am
ashamed
of
you
martin

mistress
joscelyn
i
thank
you
in
charity

for
being
that
for
me
which
i
have
never
yet
succeeded
in
being
for
myself
joscelyn
what
are
you
not
ashamed
to
offer
us
a
broken
gift
your
story
is
like
a
cracked
pitcher
with
half
the
milk
leaked
out
what
was
the
secret
of
the
lantern
the
cloak
and
the
joyce
who
was
the
lovely
lady
his
mother
and
who
the
old
crone

was
the
end
of
the
rough
master
of
coates
jessica

not
the
lovers
drown
in
the
floods
jane
and

they
did
not
what
became
of
them
please
said
little
joan

why
young
gerard

dreams
oh
please
tell

what
happened
women

is
for
trifles
said
martin
i
have
offered
you
my
cake
and
you
wish
only
to
pick
off
the
nuts
and
the
cherries
no
said
joan
we
wish
you
to
put
them
on
do
you
not
love
nuts
and
cherries
on
a
cake
more
than
anything
said
martin
a
long
while
ago
dear
maidens
there
were
lords
in
gay
street
and
up
and
down
the
street
the
bloomed
in
spring
as
they
bloomed
nowhere
else
in
sussex
and
under
the
trees
sang
and
danced
the
loveliest
lads
and
lasses
in
all
england
with
hearts
like
children
and
on
all
their
holiday
clothes
they
worked
the
leaf
and
branch
and
flower
and
fruit
of
the
cherry
and
they
never
wore
anything
else
but
their
holiday
clothes
because
in
gay
street
it
was
always
holidays
and
a
long
while
ago
there
were
gypsies
on
nyetimber
common
the
merriest
gypsies
in
the
southlands
with
the
gayest
tatters
and
the
brightest
eyes
and
the
maddest
hearts
for
they
were
also
makers
of
lanterns
when
they
were
anything
else
but
what
all
gypsies
are
and
once
the
son
of
a
gypsy
king
loved
the
daughter
of
a
lord
of
gay
street
and
she
loved
him
and
because
of
this
there
was
wrath
in
gay
street
and
scorn
on
nyetimber
and
all
things
were
done
to
keep
the
lovers
apart
but
they
who
attempt
this
might
more
profitably
chase
wild
geese
so
one
night
in
april
they
were
taken
under
one
of
her
father
own
wild
cherries
by
the
light
of
one
of
his
father
own
lanterns
and
it
was
her
father
and
his
father
who
found
them
as
they
had
missed
them
in
the
same
moment
and
were
come
hunting
for
sweethearts
by
night
with
their
people
behind
them
then
the
lord
of
gay
street
pronounced
a
curse
of
banishment
on
his
own
daughter
that
she
must
go
far
away
beyond
the
country
of
the
floods
and
another
on
his
own
tree
that
it
might
never
blossom
more
and
there
and
then
it
withered
and
the
gypsy
king
pronounced
as
dark
a
curse
of
banishment
on
his
own
son
and
a
second
on
his
own
lantern
that
it
might
never
more
give
light
and
there
and
then
it
went
out
then
from
the
crowd
of
gypsies
came
the
oldest
of
them
all
who
was
the
king
and
she
looked
from
the
angry
parents
to
the
unhappy
lovers
and
said
you
can
blight
the
tree
and
make
the
lantern
dark
nevertheless
you
can
not
extinguish
the
flower
and
the
light
of
love
and
till
these
things
lift
the
curse
and
are
seen
again
united
among
you
there
will
be
no
lords
in
gay
street
nor
kings
on
nyetimber
and
she
broke
a
shoot
from
the
cherry
and
picked
up
the
lantern
and
gave
them
to
the
lady
and
her
lover
and
then
she
took
them
one
by
each
hand
and
went
away
and
the
lord
of
gay
street
and
the
gypsy
king
died
soon
after
without
heirs
and
the
joy
went
out
of
the
hearts
of
both
peoples
and
they
dressed
in
sad
colors
for
years
but
the
three
traveled
south
through
the
country
of
the
floods
and
on
the
way
the
king
son
was
drowned
as
others
had
been
before
him
and
after
him
the
rough
master
of
coates
but
the
crone
brought
the
lady
safely
through
and
how
she
was
at
once
delivered
of
her
son
and
her
sorrow
dear
maidens
you
know
and
for
years
the
crone
was
seen
no
more
and
then
of
a
sudden
she
at
daybreak
and
bade
her
people
put
on
their
bright
apparel
because
their
king
was
coming
with
a
young
queen
and
after
this
she
led
them
to
gay
street
where
she
bade
the
folk
to
don
their
holiday
attire
because
their
lord
was
on
his
way
with
a
fair
lady
and
all
those
girls
and
boys
the
dark
and
the
light
felt
the
child
of
joy
in
their
hearts
again
and
they
went
in
the
morning
with
singing
and
dancing
to
welcome
the
comers
under
the
i
entreat
you
now
mistress
joyce
for
the
second
hair
from
your
head
second
interlude
the
milkmaids
put
their
forgotten
apples
to
their
mouths
and
the
chatter
began
to
run
out
of
them
like
juice
from
bitten
fruit
jessica
what
did
you
think
of
this
story
jane
jane
i
did
not
know
what
to
think
jessica
until
the
very
conclusion
and
then
i
was
too
amazed
to
think
anything
for
who
would
have
imagined
the
young
shepherd
to
be
in
reality
a
lord
martin
few
of
us
are
what
we
seem
mistress
jane
even
are
on
for
the
other
days
in
the
year
they
pretend
to
be
and
i
have
actually
known
men
who
appeared
to
be
haters
of
women
when
they
secretly
loved
them
most
tenderly
joscelyn
it
does
not
surprise
me
to
hear
this
i
have
always
understood
men
to
be
composed
of
caprices
martin
they
are
composed
of
nothing
else
i
see
you
know
them
through
and
through
joscelyn
i
do
not
know
anything
at
all
about
them
we
do
not
study
what
does
not
interest
us
martin
i
hope
mistress
joscelyn
you
found
my
story
worthy
of
study
joscelyn
it
served
its
turn
might
one
by
going
to
rackham
hill
see
this
same
and
this
same
shed
martin
alas
no
the
shed
rotted
with
time
and
weather
and
bit
by
bit
its
sides
were
rebuilt
with
stone
and
the
old
gerard
chopped
down
in
a
fury
and
made
firewood
of
it
but
it
too
had
served
its
turn
for
as
every
man
life
and
perhaps
but
you
must
answer
for
this
every
woman
life
awaits
the
hour
of
blossoming
that
makes
it
immortal
so
this
tree
passed
in
a
single
night
from
sterility
to
immortality
and
it
mattered
as
little
if
its
body
were
burned
the
next
day
as
it
would
have
mattered
had
gerard
and
thea
gone
down
through
the
waters
that
night
instead
of
many
years
later
after
a
of
great
joy
and
delight
joyce
i
am
glad
of
that
there
were
moments
when
i
feared
it
would
not
be
so
jennifer
i
too
for
how
could
it
be
otherwise
seeing
that
he
was
a
shepherd
and
she
a
lord
daughter
jessica
and
when
it
was
related
how
she
was
to
wed
the
rough
master
of
coates
my
hopes
were
dashed
entirely
jane
and
when
they
beat
young
gerard
i
was
perfectly
certain
he
was
dead
joan
i
rather
fancied
the
tale
would
end
happily
all
the
same
martin
i
fancied
so
too
for
though
any
of
these
accidents
would
have
marred
the
ending
love
is
a
divinity
above
all
accidents
and
guards
his
own
with
extraordinary
obstinacy
nothing
could
have
thwarted
him
of
his
way
but
one
thing
five
of
the
milkmaids
oh
what
martin
had
thea
been
one
of
those
who
are
not
interested
in
the
study
of
men
nobody
said
anything
in
the
joscelyn
she
need
not
have
been
condemned
to
unhappiness
on
that
account
singer
and
what
does
the
happiness
or
unhappiness
of
an
idle
story
weigh
whether
she
wedded
another
or
whether
they
were
parted
by
whatever
cause
such
as
her
superior
station
or
even
his
death
all
one
to
me
jennifer
and
me
jessica
and
me
jane
and
me
martin
the
tale
is
judged
let
it
go
hang
for
a
cloud
has
dropped
over
of
the
moon
like
the
eyelid
of
a
girl
who
still
peeps
through
her
lashes
but
will
soon
fall
asleep
for
weariness
i
have
made
her
lids
as
heavy
as
yours
with
my
poor
story
let
us
all
sleep
and
forget
it
so
the
girls
lay
down
in
the
grass
and
slept
but
joyce
went
on
swinging
and
every
time
she
swayed
past
him
she
looked
at
martin
and
her
lips
opened
and
shut
again
nothing
having
escaped
them
but
a
very
little
laughter
the
tenth
time
this
happened
martin
said
what
keeps
your
lashes
open
mistress
joyce
when
your
comrades
lie
tangled
on
their
cheeks
is
it
the
same
thing
that
opens
your
lips
and
peeps
through
the
doorway
and
runs
away
again
must
my
lashes
shut
because
others
do
said
joyce
may
not
lashes
have
whims
of
their
own
nothing
is
more
whimsical
said
martin
pippin
i
have
known
for
instance
lashes
that
will
be
golden
though
the
hair
of
the
head
be
dark
it
is
a
silly
trick
i
do
dislike
such
lashes
said
joyce
that
is
i
think
i
should
not
if
ever
i
saw
them
martin
perhaps
you
are
right
i
should
love
them
in
a
woman
joyce
i
never
saw
them
in
a
woman
martin
in
a
man
they
would
be
regrettable
joyce
then
why
did
you
give
them
to
young
gerard
martin
did
i
it
was
pure
carelessness
let
us
change
the
color
of
his
lashes
joyce
no
no
i
will
not
have
them
changed
i
would
not
for
the
world
martin
dear
mistress
joyce
if
i
had
the
world
to
offer
you
i
would
sit
by
the
road
and
break
it
with
a
pickax
rather
than
change
a
single
eyelash
in
young
gerard
lids
since
you
love
them
joyce
oh
did
i
say
so
martin
did
you
mistress
joyce
when
you
laugh
i
am
ready
to
forgive
you
all
your
debts
joyce
why
what
do
i
owe
you
martin
an
eyelash
joyce
i
am
sure
i
do
not
martin
no
then
a
hair
of
some
sort
how
will
you
be
able
to
sleep
with
a
hair
on
your
conscience
for
your
own
sake
lift
that
crowbar
joyce
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
fear
to
redeem
my
promise
lest
you
are
unable
to
redeem
yours
martin
which
was
joyce
to
blow
it
to
its
fellow
who
is
now
wandering
in
the
night
like
thistledown
martin
i
will
do
it
nevertheless
joyce
it
is
easier
promised
than
proved
but
here
is
the
hair
martin
are
you
certain
it
is
the
same
hair
joyce
i
kept
it
wound
round
my
finger
martin
i
know
no
better
way
of
keeping
a
hair
so
here
it
goes
and
he
held
the
hair
to
his
lips
and
blew
on
it
martin
a
blessing
on
it
it
will
soon
be
wedded
joyce
i
have
your
word
on
it
martin
you
shall
have
your
eyes
on
it
if
you
will
tell
me
one
thing
joyce
is
it
a
little
thing
martin
it
as
trifling
as
a
hair
i
wish
only
to
know
why
you
have
fallen
out
with
men
joyce
for
the
best
of
reasons
why
master
pippin
they
say
the
world
is
round
martin
heaven
preserve
us
was
ever
so
giddy
a
statement
round
why
the
world
as
full
of
edges
as
the
dealings
of
men
and
women
in
which
you
can
scarcely
go
a
day
march
without
reaching
the
end
of
all
things
and
tumbling
into
heaven
i
tell
you
i
have
traveled
the
world
more
than
any
man
living
and
it
takes
me
all
my
time
to
keep
from
falling
off
the
brink
round
the
world
is
one
great
precipice
joyce
i
said
so
i
said
so
i
know
i
was
right
i
should
like
to
tell
them
so
martin
were
you
only
able
to
go
out
of
the
orchard
you
would
be
free
to
tell
them
so
they
are
such
fools
these
men
joyce
not
in
all
matters
master
pippin
but
certainly
in
this
they
are
good
at
some
things
martin
for
my
part
i
ca
think
what
joyce
they
whitewash
cowsheds
beautifully
martin
who
would
whitewash
is
such
beautiful
stuff
no
let
us
be
done
with
these
men
and
go
to
bed
good
night
dear
milkmaid
joyce
ah
but
singer
you
have
not
yet
proved
your
fable
of
the
two
hairs
which
you
swore
were
as
hard
to
keep
apart
as
the
two
lovers
in
your
tale
whom
love
guarded
against
accidents
said
martin
and
he
held
out
to
her
the
third
finger
of
his
left
hand
and
wound
at
its
base
were
the
two
hairs
in
a
ring
as
fine
as
a
cobweb
she
took
his
finger
between
two
of
hers
and
laughed
and
examined
it
and
laughed
again
you
have
been
playing
the
god
of
love
to
my
hairs
said
joyce
somebody
must
protect
those
that
can
not
or
will
not
be
kind
to
themselves
said
martin
and
then
his
other
fingers
closed
quickly
on
her
hand
and
he
said
dear
mistress
joyce
help
me
to
play
the
god
of
love
to
gillian
and
give
me
your
key
to
the
because
there
were
moments
when
you
feared
my
tale
would
end
unhappily
she
pulled
her
hand
away
and
began
to
swing
rapidly
without
answering
but
presently
she
exclaimed
oh
oh
it
has
dropped
what
what
said
martin
anxiously
but
she
only
cried
again
oh
my
heart
it
has
dropped
under
the
swing
in
love
name
said
martin
let
me
recover
your
heart
he
groped
in
the
grass
and
found
what
she
had
dropped
and
then
was
obliged
to
fall
flat
on
his
back
to
escape
her
feet
as
she
swung
well
any
time
a
time
for
laughing
said
martin
crawling
forth
and
getting
on
his
knees
here
the
key
to
your
heart
laughing
joyce
oh
martin
how
can
i
take
it
with
my
hands
on
the
ropes
then
i
lay
it
on
your
lap
oh
martin
how
do
you
expect
it
to
stay
there
while
i
swing
then
you
must
stop
swinging
oh
martin
i
will
never
stop
swinging
as
long
as
i
live
then
what
must
i
do
with
this
key
oh
martin
why
do
you
bother
me
so
about
an
old
key
ca
you
see
i
busy
oh
joyce
when
you
laugh
i
must
i
must
yes
i
must
and
he
caught
her
two
little
feet
in
his
hands
as
she
next
flew
by
and
kissed
each
one
upon
the
instep
then
he
ran
to
his
bed
under
the
hedge
and
she
sat
where
she
was
till
her
laughing
turned
to
smiling
and
her
smiling
to
sleeping
maids
maids
maids
it
was
morning
to
your
master
pippin
urged
joscelyn
it
our
master
come
again
martin
concealed
himself
with
speed
and
an
instant
later
the
burly
face
peered
through
the
gap
in
the
hedge
good
morrow
maids
good
morrow
master
has
my
daughter
stopped
weeping
yet
no
master
said
joyce
but
i
begin
to
think
that
she
will
before
long
a
little
longer
will
be
too
long
moaned
gillman
for
my
purse

running
dry
with
these
droughty
times
and
i

am
foiled
of

water
and
milk
who
would
have
daughters
when
he
might
have
sons
gillian
he
cried
when
will
ye
learn
that
old
heads
are
wiser
than
young
ones
but
gillian
paid
no
more
attention
to
him
than
to
the
cawing
rooks
in
the
elms
in
the
oatfield
take
your
bread
maids
said
gillman
and
heaven
send

grace
just
an
instant
master
said
joyce
i
would
like
to
know
if
blossom
my
shorthorn
is
well
as
well
as
a
child
without
its
mother
maid
though
michael
has
turned
nurse
to
her
but
she
seems
sworn
to
hold
back
her
milk
till
you
come
again
rack
and
ruin
nothing
but
rack
and
ruin
and
off
he
went
then
breakfast
was
prepared
as
on
the
previous
day
and
gillian
stale
loaf
was
broken
for
the
ducks
but
joscelyn
pointed
out
that
one
of
the
had
been
pulled
off
in
the
night
your
stories
master
pippin
are
doing
their
work
said
she
i
begin
to
think
so
said
martin
cheerfully
and
then
they
fell
to
on
their
own
white
loaves
and
sweet
apples
when
they
had
breakfasted
martin
observed
that
he
could
make
better
and
longer
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
and
his
statement
was
by
six
voices
at
once
for
girls
fingers
said
these
voices
had
been
especially
fashioned
by
nature
for
the
making
of
martin
challenged
them
to
prove
this
and
they
plucked
lapfuls
of
the
small
white
daisies
with
big
yellow
eyes
and
threaded
chains
of
great
length
and
hung
them
about
each
other
necks
and
so
deft
and
dainty
was
their
touch
that
the
chains
never
broke
in
the
making
or
what
is
still
more
delicate
a
matter
in
the
hanging
but
martin
chains
always
broke
before
he
had
joined
the
last
daisy
to
the
first
and
the
girls
jeered
at
him
for
having
no
necklace
to
match
their
necklaces
of
pearls
and
gold
and
for
failing
so
contemptibly
in
his
boast
and
he
appeared
so
abashed
by
their
jeers
that
little
joan
relented
and
made
a
longer
chain
than
any
that
had
been
made
yet
and
hung
it
round
his
neck
at
which
he
was
merry
again
and
confessed
himself
beaten
and
the
girls
became
very
gracious
being
in
their
triumph
even
more
pleased
with
him
than
with
themselves
which
was
a
great
deal
and
by
then
it
was
after
dinner
martin
proposed
that
as
they
had
sat
all
the
morning
they
should
run
all
the
afternoon
so
they
played
touchwood
and
martin
was
he
but
an
orchard
is
so
full
of
wood
that
he
had
a
hard
job
of
it
and
he
observed
that
jennifer
had
very
little
daring
and
scarcely
ever
lifted
her
finger
from
the
wood
as
she
ran
from
one
tree
to
another
and
that
jane
had
no
daring
at
all
and
never
even
left
her
tree
and
that
joscelyn
was
extremely
daring
when
it
was
safe
to
be
so
and
that
jessica
was
daring
enough
to
tweak
him
and
run
away
while
joyce
was
more
daring
still
for
she
tweaked
him
and
did
not
run
as
for
little
joan
she
puzzled
him
most
of
all
for
half
the
time
she
outdid
them
all
in
daring
and
then
she
was
uncatchable
slipping
through
his
very
fingers
like
a
ray
of
sunlight
a
child
tries
to
hold
but
the
other
half
of
the
time
she
was
timidity
itself
and
crept
from
tree
to
tree
and
if
he
were
near
became
like
a
little
frightened
rabbit
forgetting
or
being
through
fear
unable
to
touch
safety
and
then
she
was
snared
more
easily
than
any
by
supper
however
every
maid
had
been
he
but
jane
for
no
man
can
catch
what
does
run
how
the
time
has
flown
said
joscelyn
when
they
were
all
seated
about
the
middle
tree
after
the
meal
it
makes
such
a
difference
said
jennifer
when
there
something
to
do
we
never
used
to
have
anything
to
do
till
master
pippin
came
and
now
life
is
all
games
and
stories
the
games
said
joscelyn
are
well
enough
shall
we
said
martin
forego
the
stories
oh
master
pippin
said
jennifer
anxiously
we
surely
are
to
have
a
story
unless
we
are
to
remain
here
for
ever
said
martin
i
fear
we
must
but
for
my
part
i
am
quite
happy
here
are
not
you
mistress
joscelyn
your
questions
are
idle
said
she
you
know
very
well
that
we
can
not
escape
a
story
you
see
mistress
jennifer
said
martin
let
us
resign
ourselves
therefore
and
for
your
better
diversion
please
sit
in
the
swing
and
when
the
story
is
tedious
you
will
have
a
remedy
at
hand
so
saying
he
put
jennifer
on
the
seat
and
her
hands
on
the
ropes
and
the
five
other
girls
climbed
into
the
tree
while
he
took
the
bough
that
had
become
his
own
and
all
provided
themselves
with
apples
begin
said
joscelyn
a
said
martin
as
much
as
any
other
craftsman
needs
his
instruments
of
which
his
auditors
are
the
chief
and
of
these
i
lack
one
and
he
fixed
his
eyes
of
the
weeper
in
the
you
have
six
already
said
joscelyn
the
seventh
you
must
acquire
as
you
proceed
so
begin
without
the
vital
tool
cried
martin
as
well
might
you
bid
madam
toad
to
spin
flax
without
her
distaff
what
folly
is
this
said
joscelyn
toads
do
spin
do
they
said
martin
much
astonished
i
thought
they
did
what
then
is
toadflax
do
the
wildflowers
not
know
and
still
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
gillian
he
thrummed
and
sang
toad
toad
old
toad
what
are
you
spinning
seven
hanks
of
yellow
flax
into
linen
what
will
you
do
with
it
then
toad
pray
make
shifts
for
seven
brides
against
their
suppose
a
one
of
them
refuses
to
be
wed
then
she
shall
not
see
the
jewel
i
wear
in
my
head
as
he
concluded
gillian
raised
herself
on
her
two
elbows
and
with
her
chin
on
her
palms
gazed
steadily
over
the
duckpond
joscelyn
why
seven
martin
is
it
not
as
good
a
number
as
another
jennifer
what
is
the
jewel
like
in
the
toad
head
master
pippin
martin
how
can
i
say
mistress
jennifer
there
but
one
way
of
knowing
according
to
the
song
and
like
a
fool
i
refused
it
jennifer
i
wish
i
knew
martin
the
way
lies
open
to
all
joscelyn
these
are
silly
legends
jennifer
it
is
as
little
likely
that
there
are
jewels
in
toads
heads
as
that
toads
spin
flax
but
master
pippin
pins
his
faith
to
any
nonsense
martin
true
mistress
joscelyn
my
faith
cries
for
and
he
who
pins
his
faith
to
is
like
to
get
a
cramp
in
it
therefore
since
women
as
i
hear
tell
have
ceased
to
spin
shifts
i
am
obliged
to
believe
that
these
things
are
spun
by
toads
because
brides
there
must
be
though
the
wells
should
run
dry
joscelyn
i
do
not
see
the
connection
however
it
is
obvious
that
the
bad
logic
of
your
song
has
aroused
even
gillian
attention
so
for
mercy
sake
make
short
work
of
your
tale
before
it
flags
again
martin
i
will
follow
your
advice
and
do
you
follow
me
with
your
best
attention
while
i
turn
the
wheel
of
the
mill
of
dreams
the
mill
of
dreams
there
was
once
dear
maidens
a
girl
who
lived
in
a
mill
on
the
sidlesham
marshes
but
in
those
days
the
marshlands
were
meadowlands
with
streams
running
in
from
the
coast
so
that
their
water
was
brackish
and
salt
and
sometimes
the
girl
dipped
her
finger
in
the
water
and
sucked
it
and
tasted
the
sea
and
the
taste
made
storms
rise
in
her
heart
her
name
was
helen
the
was
a
gaunt
and
gloomy
building
of
stone
as
gray
as
sleep
weatherstained
with
dreams
it
had
fine
proportions
and
looked
like
a
noble
prison
and
in
fact
if
a
prison
is
the
lockhouse
of
secrets
it
was
one
the
great
millstones
ground
day
and
night
and
what
the
world
sent
in
as
corn
it
got
back
as
flour
and
as
to
the
secrets
of
the
grinding
it
asked
no
questions
because
to
the
world
results
are
everything
it
understands
death
better
than
sorrow
marriage
better
than
love
and
birth
better
than
creation
and
the
millstones
of
joy
and
pain
grinding
dreams
into
bread
it
seldom
hears
but
helen
heard
them
and
they
were
all
the
knowledge
she
had
of
life
for
if
the
mill
was
a
prison
of
dreams
it
was
her
prison
too
her
father
the
miller
was
a
harsh
man
and
dark
he
was
dark
within
and
without
her
mother
was
dead
she
did
not
remember
her
as
she
grew
up
she
did
little
by
little
the
work
of
the
big
place
she
was
her
father
servant
and
he
kept
her
as
close
to
her
work
as
he
kept
his
millstones
to
theirs
he
was
morose
and
welcomed
no
company
gayety
he
hated
helen
knew
no
songs
for
she
had
heard
none
from
morning
till
night
she
worked
for
her
father
when
she
had
done
all
her
other
work
she
spun
flax
into
linen
for
shirts
and
gowns
and
wool
for
stockings
and
vests
if
she
went
outside
the
it
was
only
for
a
few
steps
for
a
few
moments
she
was
two
miles
from
the
sea
but
she
had
never
seen
it
but
she
tasted
the
salt
water
and
smelt
the
salt
wind
like
all
things
that
grow
up
away
from
the
light
she
was
pale
her
oval
face
was
like
ivory
and
her
lips
instead
of
being
scarlet
had
the
tender
red
of
after
the
unfolding
of
the
bright
bud
her
hair
was
black
and
smooth
and
heavy
and
lay
on
either
side
of
her
face
like
a
starling
wings
her
eyes
too
were
as
black
as
midnight
and
sometimes
like
midnight
they
were
deep
and
sightless
but
when
she
was
neither
working
nor
spinning
she
would
steal
away
to
the
millstones
and
stand
there
watching
and
listening
and
then
there
were
two
stars
in
the
midnight
she
came
away
from
those
stolen
times
powdered
with
flour
her
black
hair
and
her
brows
and
lashes
her
old
blue
gown
her
rough
hands
and
fair
neck
and
her
white
face
all
that
was
dark
and
pale
in
her
was
merged
in
a
mist
and
seen
only
through
the
clinging
dust
of
the
millstones
she
would
try
to
wipe
off
all
the
evidences
of
her
secret
occasions
but
her
father
generally
knew
had
he
known
by
nothing
else
he
need
only
have
looked
at
her
eyes
before
they
lost
their
starlight
one
day
when
she
was
seventeen
years
old
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
nobody
ever
knocked
her
father
was
the
only
man
who
came
in
and
went
out
the
mill
stood
solitary
in
those
days
the
face
of
the
country
has
since
been
changed
by
man
and
god
but
at
that
time
there
were
no
habitations
in
sight
at
regular
times
the
peasants
brought
their
grain
and
fetched
their
meal
but
the
miller
kept
his
daughter
away
from
his
custom
he
never
said
why
doubtless
at
the
back
of
his
mind
was
the
thought
of
losing
what
was
useful
to
him
most
parents
have
their
ways
of
trying
to
keep
their
children
in
some
it
is
this
way
in
others
that
not
many
learn
to
keep
them
by
letting
them
go
so
when
the
knock
came
at
the
door
it
was
the
strangest
thing
that
had
ever
happened
in
helen
life
she
ran
to
the
door
and
stood
with
her
hand
on
the
heavy
wooden
bar
that
fell
across
it
into
a
great
socket
her
heart
beat
fast
before
we
know
a
thing
it
is
a
thousand
things
only
one
thing
would
be
there
when
she
lifted
the
bar
but
as
she
stood
with
her
hand
upon
it
a
host
of
presences
hovered
on
the
other
side
a
knight
in
armor
a
king
in
his
gold
crown
a
god
in
the
guise
of
a
beggar
an
angel
with
a
sword
a
dragon
even
a
woman
to
be
her
friend
her
mother
a
child
would
it
be
better
not
to
open
thought
helen
for
then
she
would
never
know
yes
then
she
could
run
to
her
millstones
and
fling
them
her
thoughts
in
the
husk
and
listen
listen
while
they
ground
them
into
dreams
what
knowledge
would
be
better
than
that
what
would
she
lose
by
opening
the
door
but
she
had
to
open
the
door
outside
on
the
stones
stood
a
common
lad
he
might
have
been
three
years
older
than
she
he
had
a
cap
with
a
hole
in
it
in
his
hand
and
a
shabby
jersey
that
left
his
brown
neck
bare
he
was
whistling
when
she
lifted
the
bar
but
he
stopped
as
the
door
fell
back
and
gave
helen
a
quick
and
careless
look
can
i
have
a
bit
of
bread
he
asked
helen
stared
at
him
without
answering
she
was
so
unused
to
people
that
her
mind
had
to
be
summoned
from
a
world
of
ghosts
before
she
could
hear
and
utter
real
words
the
boy
waited
for
her
to
speak
but
as
she
did
not
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turned
away
whistling
his
tune
then
she
understood
that
he
was
going
and
she
ran
after
him
quickly
and
touched
his
sleeve
he
turned
again
expecting
her
to
speak
but
she
was
still
dumb
thought
better
of
it
he
said
helen
said
slowly
why
did
you
ask
me
for
bread
why
he
looked
her
up
and
down
to
mend
my
boots
with
of
course
she
looked
at
his
boots
you
silly
thing
grinned
the
boy
a
faint
color
came
under
her
skin
i
sorry
for
being
stupid
i
suppose
you
hungry
as
a
hunter
but
there
no
call
to
trouble
you
i
be
where
i
can
get
bread
and
meat
too
in
forty
minutes
child
no
said
helen
please
do
go
i
like
to
give
you
some
bread
oh
all
right
said
the
boy
what
frightened
you
did
you
think
i
was
a
scamp
i
was
frightened
said
helen
do
tell
me
mocked
the
boy
you
could
get
a
word
out
i
was
frightened
you
thought
i
was
a
bad
lot
you
do
know
i
not
one
now
helen
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
turned
away
quickly
i
get
you
your
bread
she
said
you
are
a
silly
are
you
said
the
boy
as
she
disappeared
before
long
she
came
back
with
half
a
loaf
in
one
hand
and
something
in
the
other
which
she
kept
behind
her
back
thanks
said
the
boy
taking
the
bit
of
loaf
what
else
have
you
got
there
it
something
better
than
bread
said
helen
slowly
well
let
have
a
look
at
it
she
took
her
hand
from
behind
her
and
offered
him
seven
ears
of
wheat
they
were
heavy
with
grain
and
bowed
on
their
ripe
stems
is
this
what
you
call
better
than
bread
he
asked
it
is
better
oh
all
right
i
eat
it
though
not
all
at
once
no
said
helen
keep
it
till
you
hungry
the
grains
go
quite
a
long
way
when
you
hungry
i
eat
one
a
year
said
the
boy
and
then
they
go
so
far
they
outlast
me
my
lifetime
yes
said
helen
but
the
bread
will
be
gone
in
forty
minutes
and
then
you
be
where
you
can
get
meat
you
funny
thing
said
the
boy
puzzled
because
she
never
smiled
where
can
you
get
meat
she
asked
in
a
boat
fishing
for
rabbits
but
she
took
no
notice
of
the
rabbits
she
said
eagerly
a
boat
are
you
going
in
a
boat
yes
are
you
a
sailor
you
hit
it
you
seen
the
sea
you
been
on
the
sea
sailors
do
that
oh
dear
no
said
the
boy
we
sail
three
times
round
the
duckpond
and
come
home
for
tea
helen
hung
her
head
the
boy
put
his
hand
up
to
his
mouth
and
watched
her
over
it
well
he
said
presently
i
must
get
along
to
pagham
he
stuck
the
little
sheaf
of
wheat
through
the
hole
in
his
cap
and
it
bobbed
like
a
plume
over
his
ear
then
he
felt
in
his
pocket
and
after
some
fumbling
got
hold
of
what
he
wanted
and
pulled
it
out
here
you
are
child
he
said
and
thank
you
again
he
put
his
present
into
her
hand
and
swung
off
whistling
he
turned
once
to
wave
to
her
and
the
corn
in
his
cap
nodded
with
its
weight
and
his
light
gait
she
stood
gazing
till
he
was
out
of
sight
and
then
she
looked
at
what
he
had
given
her
it
was
a
shell
she
had
heard
of
shells
of
course
but
she
had
never
seen
one
yet
she
knew
this
was
no
english
shell
it
was
as
large
as
the
top
of
a
teacup
but
more
oval
than
round
over
its
surface
like
pearl
rippled
waves
of
and
under
a
luster
that
was
like
golden
moonlight
on
the
ocean
she
could
not
define
or
trace
the
waves
of
color
they
flowed
in
and
out
of
each
other
with
interchangeable
movement
one
half
of
the
outer
rim
which
was
transparently
thin
and
curled
like
the
fantastic
edge
of
a
surf
wave
was
flecked
with
a
faint
play
of
rose
and
cream
and
silver
that
melted
imperceptibly
into
the
moonlit
sea
when
she
turned
the
shell
over
she
found
that
she
could
not
see
its
heart
the
side
of
the
shell
curled
under
like
a
smooth
billow
and
then
broke
into
a
world
of
caves
and
caves
within
caves
whose
final
secret
she
could
not
discover
but
within
and
within
the
color
grew
deeper
and
deeper
bottomless
blues
and
unfathomable
greens
shot
with
such
gleams
of
light
as
made
her
heart
throb
for
they
were
like
the
gleams
that
shoot
through
our
dreams
the
light
that
just
eludes
us
when
we
wake
she
went
into
the
mill
trembling
from
head
to
foot
she
was
not
conscious
of
moving
but
she
found
herself
presently
standing
by
the
grinding
stones
with
sound
rushing
through
her
and
white
dust
whirling
round
her
she
gazed
and
gazed
into
the
labyrinth
of
the
shell
as
though
she
must
see
to
its
very
core
but
she
could
not
so
she
unfastened
her
blue
gown
and
laid
the
shell
against
her
young
heart
it
was
for
the
first
time
of
so
many
times
that
i
know
not
whether
when
twenty
years
later
she
did
it
for
the
last
time
they
outnumbered
the
silver
hairs
among
her
black
ones
and
the
silver
by
then
were
uncountable
yet
on
the
day
when
helen
began
her
twenty
years
of
lonely
listening
but
having
said
this
martin
pippin
grasped
the
rope
just
above
jennifer
hand
and
pulled
it
with
such
force
that
the
swing
instead
of
swinging
back
and
forth
as
a
swing
should
reeled
sideways
so
that
the
swinger
had
much
ado
to
keep
her
seat
jennifer
heaven
help
me
martin
heaven
help
me
i
need
its
help
more
sorely
than
you
do
jennifer
oh
you
should
be
punished
not
helped
martin
i
have
been
punished
and
the
punished
require
help
more
than
censure
or
scorn
or
anger
or
any
other
form
of
righteousness
jennifer
who
has
punished
you
and
for
what
martin
you
mistress
jennifer
for
my
bad
story
jennifer
i
do
not
remember
doing
so
the
story
is
only
begun
i
am
sure
it
will
be
a
very
good
story
martin
now
you
are
compassionate
because
i
need
comfort
but
the
truth
is
that
good
or
bad
you
care
no
more
for
my
story
for
i
saw
a
tear
of
vexation
come
into
your
eye
jennifer
it
was
not
vexation
not
exactly
vexation
and
doubtless
helen
will
have
experiences
which
we
shall
all
be
glad
to
hear
but
all
the
same
i
wish
martin
you
wish
jennifer
that
she
was
not
going
to
grow
old
in
her
loneliness
because
all
lovers
are
young
martin
you
have
spoken
the
most
beautiful
of
all
truths
does
the
grass
grow
high
enough
by
the
swing
for
you
to
pluck
me
two
blades
jennifer
i
think
so
yes
what
do
you
want
with
them
martin
i
want
but
one
of
them
now
you
shall
only
give
me
the
other
if
at
the
end
of
my
tale
you
agree
that
its
lovers
are
as
green
as
this
blade
and
that
on
the
day
resumed
martin
when
helen
began
her
lonely
listening
of
heart
and
ears
betwixt
the
seashell
and
the
millstones
of
her
dreams
there
was
not
dear
mistress
jennifer
a
silver
thread
in
her
black
locks
to
vex
you
with
for
a
girl
of
seventeen
is
but
a
child
yet
old
enough
to
begin
spinning
the
stuff
of
the
spirit
my
boy
oh
how
strange
it
was
your
coming
like
that
so
suddenly
before
i
opened
the
door
i
stood
there
guessing
and
how
could
i
have
guessed
this
did
you
guess
too
on
the
other
side
no
not
much
i
thought
it
might
be
a
cross
old
woman
what
did
you
guess
oh
such
stupid
things
kings
and
knights
and
even
women
and
it
was
you
and
it
was
you
suppose
i
been
a
cross
old
woman
suppose
i
been
a
king
and
you
were
just
my
boy
and
you
my
sulky
girl
oh
i
was
sulky
oh
did
you
understand
how
could
i
speak
to
you
i
could
hear
you
i
could
see
you
even
can
you
see
me
now
she
was
lying
with
her
cheek
against
his
heart
and
she
turned
her
face
suddenly
inwards
because
she
saw
him
bend
his
head
and
the
sweetness
of
his
first
kiss
was
going
to
be
more
than
she
could
bear
why
do
you
look
up
you
silly
child
why
do
you
look
at
me
dear
how
can
i
yet
can
i
ever
it
so
hard
looking
in
a
person
eyes
but
i
am
looking
at
you
i
am
though
you
ca
see
me
then
tell
me
what
color
my
eyes
are
they
and
your
hair
is
dark
red
a
sort
of
chestnut
but
a
little
redder
and
rough
over
your
forehead
and
your
nose
is
all
over
freckles
with
very
very
snub
martin
heaven
help
you
mistress
jennifer
jennifer
master
pippin
martin
were
you
not
about
to
fall
again
jennifer
martin
i
see
you
are
as
firm
as
a
rock
how
could
i
have
been
so
deceived
he
shook
her
a
little
in
his
arms
saying
how
rude
you
are
to
my
nose
i
wish
you
look
up
no
not
yet
presently
but
you
did
you
look
at
me
did
you
see
me
look
when
as
soon
as
you
opened
the
door
what
did
you
see
the
loveliest
thing
i
ever
seen
i
not
really
am
i
i
used
to
dream
about
you
at
night
on
my
watches
i
made
you
up
out
of
bits
of
the
night
white
moonlight
black
clouds
and
stars
sometimes
i
would
take
the
last
cloud
of
sunset
for
your
lips
and
the
wind
when
it
was
gentle
for
your
voice
and
the
movements
of
the
sea
for
your
movements
and
the
rise
and
fall
of
it
for
your
breathing
and
the
lap
of
it
against
the
boat
for
your
kisses
oh
child
look
up
she
looked
up
what
your
name
helen
i
ca
hear
you
helen

it

trying
to

oh
why
did
you
tell
me
boy
oh
child
why
did
you
tell
me
is
my
bread
sweet
to
you
the
sweetest
i
ever
ate
i
ate
it
slowly
and
took
each
bit
from
your
hand
i
kept
one
crust
and
my
corn
oh
your
corn
that
is
everlasting
you
have
sown
your
seed
i
have
eaten
a
grain
and
it
bore
its
harvest
one
by
one
i
shall
eat
them
and
every
grain
will
bear
its
full
harvest
you
have
replenished
the
unknown
earth
with
fields
of
golden
corn
and
set
me
walking
there
for
ever
and
you
have
thrown
golden
light
upon
strange
waters
and
set
me
floating
there
for
ever
oh
you
on
my
earth
and
i
on
your
ocean
how
shall
we
meet
your
corn
is
my
waters
my
waters
are
your
corn
they
move
on
one
wave
oh
child
we
are
borne
on
it
together
for
ever
but
how
you
teased
me
i
could
help
it
you
and
your
boats
and
your
duckponds
it
was
such
fun
you
were
so
serious
it
was
so
easy
to
tease
you
why
did
you
put
your
hand
over
your
mouth
to
keep
myself
from
laughing
at
me
kissing
you
you
looked
so
sorry
because
sailors
only
sail
round
duckponds
when
you
thought
they
always
sailed
out
by
the
west
and
home
by
the
east
you
believed
the
duckponds
i
did
really
for
a
moment
i
felt
so
stupid
you
blushed
oh
did
i
a
very
little
like
the
inside
of
a
shell
i
always
tease
you
to
make
you
blush
like
that
do
you
ever
smile
or
laugh
child
you
might
teach
me
to
i
have
had
the
sort
of
life
that
makes
one
smile
and
laugh
oh
but
i
could
i
could
smile
and
laugh
for
you
if
you
wished
i
could
do
anything
you
wanted
i
could
be
anything
you
wanted
shall
i
make
something
of
you
what
shall
it
be
i
do
care
so
long
as
it
is
yours
oh
make
something
of
me
been
lonely
always
i
do
want
to
be
any
more
i
want
to
be
able
to
come
to
you
when
i
please
not
only
because
i
need
so
much
to
come
but
because
you
need
me
to
come
can
you
make
me
sure
that
you
need
me
when
no
one
has
ever
needed
you
how
can
you
believe
oh
no
no
do
look
sorry
i
do
believe
it
and
will
you
always
stand
with
me
here
in
the
loneliness
that
has
been
so
dark
then
it
wo
be
dark
any
more
why
do
two
people
make
light
one
alone
only
wanders
and
holds
out
her
hand
and
finds
no
one
nothing
sometimes
not
even
herself
will
you
be
with
me
always
always
why
because
i
love
you
no
said
helen
but
because
i
love
you
tell
me
were
you
frightened
of
you
when
i
saw
you
at
the
door
yes
were
you
oh
my
boy
but
did
you
think
i
might
be
a
scamp
i
did
think
about
it
at
all
it
would
have
made
any
difference
then
why
were
you
as
mum
as
a
fish
oh
my
boy
why
why
why
if
you
were
frightened
of
course
you
were
frightened
no
no
i
was
i
told
you
i
was
why
do
you
believe
me
oh
you
laughing
at
me
again
you
blushing
again
it
so
easy
to
make
me
ashamed
when
i
been
silly
of
course
you
know
now
why
i
could
speak
you
know
what
took
my
words
away
you
know
then
how
could
i
know
how
could
i
dream
it
would
be
as
quick
for
you
as
for
me
one
can
dream
anything
oh
what
is
it
child
for
she
had
caught
at
her
heart
dreams
and
not
truth
oh
are
you
here
am
i
where
are
you
where
are
you
hold
me
hold
me
fast
do
let
it
be
just
empty
dreams
hush
hush
my
dear
dreams
are
empty
dreams
are
as
near
the
truth
as
we
can
come
what
greater
truth
can
you
ever
have
than
this
for
as
men
and
women
dream
they
drop
one
by
one
the
veils
between
them
and
the
mystery
but
when
they
meet
they
are
shrouded
in
the
veils
again
and
though
they
long
to
strip
them
off
they
can
not
and
each
sees
of
each
but
dimly
the
truth
which
in
their
dreams
was
as
clear
as
light
oh
child
it
not
our
dreams
that
are
our
illusions
no
she
whispered
but
still
it
is
not
enough
not
quite
enough
for
the
beloved
that
they
shall
dream
apart
and
find
their
truths
apart
in
life
too
they
must
touch
and
find
the
mystery
together
though
it
be
only
for
one
eternal
instant
touch
me
not
only
in
my
dreams
but
in
life
turn
life
itself
into
the
dream
at
last
oh
hold
me
fast
my
boy
my
boy
hush
hush
child
i
holding
you
you
wept
oh
did
you
see
i
turned
my
head
away
why
did
you
weep
because
you
thought
i
had
misjudged
you
then
i
misjudged
you
but
i
did
not
weep
for
that
would
you
if
i
misjudged
you
it
would
not
be
so
hard
to
bear
and
you
went
away
with
tears
and
brought
me
the
corn
of
your
mill
and
you
took
it
with
smiles
and
gave
me
the
shell
of
your
seas
your
corn
rustled
through
my
head
your
shell
whispers
at
my
heart
you
shall
always
hear
it
whispering
there
it
will
tell
you
what
i
can
never
tell
you
or
only
tell
you
in
other
ways
of
your
life
on
the
sea
of
the
countries
over
the
water
of
storms
and
islands
and
flashing
birds
and
strange
bright
flowers
of
all
the
lands
and
life
i
never
seen
and
dream
of
all
wrong
will
it
tell
me
those
things
of
your
life
that
i
do
know
yes
perhaps
but
i
could
tell
you
of
that
life
of
what
other
life
will
it
tell
me
of
my
life
that
you
do
know
is
there
one
look
in
your
own
heart
i
am
looking
and
listen
yes
what
do
you
hear
oh
boy
the
whispering
of
your
shell
oh
child
the
rustling
of
your
corn
oh
maids
the
grinding
of
the
millstones
this
is
only
a
little
part
of
what
she
heard
but
if
i
told
you
the
whole
we
should
rise
from
the
story
for
every
day
she
carried
her
boy
shell
to
the
grinding
stones
and
stood
there
while
it
spoke
against
her
heart
and
at
other
times
of
the
day
it
lay
in
her
pocket
while
she
swept
and
cooked
and
spun
and
she
saw
shadows
of
her
in
the
cobwebs
and
the
rising
steam
and
heard
echos
of
them
in
her
singing
kettle
and
her
singing
wheel
and
at
night
it
lay
on
her
pillow
against
her
ear
and
the
voice
of
the
waters
went
through
her
sleep
so
the
years
slipped
one
by
one
and
she
grew
from
a
girl
into
a
young
woman
and
presently
passed
out
of
her
youth
but
her
eyes
and
her
heart
were
still
those
of
a
girl
for
life
had
touched
them
with
nothing
but
a
girl
dream
and
it
is
not
time
that
leaves
its
traces
on
the
spirit
whatever
it
may
do
to
the
body
her
father
meanwhile
grew
harder
and
more
tyrannical
with
years
there
was
little
for
him
to
fear
now
that
any
man
would
come
to
take
her
from
him
but
the
habit
of
the
oppressor
was
on
him
and
of
the
oppressed
on
her
and
when
this
has
been
many
years
established
it
is
hard
for
either
to
realize
that
to
escape
the
oppressed
has
only
to
open
the
door
and
go
yet
helen
if
she
had
ever
thought
of
escape
into
another
world
and
life
would
not
have
desired
it
for
in
leaving
her
millstones
she
would
have
lost
a
world
whose
boundaries
she
had
never
touched
and
a
life
whose
sweetness
she
had
never
exhausted
and
she
would
have
lost
her
clue
to
knowledge
of
him
who
was
to
her
always
the
boy
in
the
old
jersey
who
had
knocked
at
her
door
so
many
years
ago
once
he
was
shipwrecked
the
waters
had
sucked
her
under
twice
already
when
her
helpless
hands
hit
against
some
floating
substance
on
the
waves
she
could
not
have
grasped
it
by
herself
for
her
strength
was
gone
but
a
hand
gripped
her
in
the
darkness
and
dragged
her
almost
insensible
to
safety
for
a
long
while
she
lay
inert
across
the
knees
of
her
rescuer
consciousness
was
at
its
very
boundary
she
knew
that
in
some
dim
distance
strong
hands
were
chafing
a
wet
and
frozen
body
but
whose
hands
whose
body
presently
it
was
lifted
to
the
shelter
of
strong
arms
and
now
she
was
conscious
of
her
own
but
it
was
like
a
heart
beating
in
air
not
in
a
body
then
warmth
and
breath
began
to
fall
like
garments
about
this
bodiless
heart
and
they
were
indeed
not
her
own
warmth
and
breath
but
these
things
given
to
her
by
another
the
warmth
was
that
of
his
own
body
where
he
had
laid
her
cold
hands
and
breast
to
take
what
heat
there
was
in
him
and
the
breath
was
of
his
own
lungs
putting
life
into
hers
through
their
two
mouths
opened
her
eyes
it
was
dark
the
darkness
she
had
come
out
of
was
bright
beside
this
pitchy
night
and
her
struggle
back
to
life
less
painful
than
the
fierce
labor
of
the
wind
and
waves
their
frail
precarious
craft
was
in
ceaseless
peril
his
left
arm
held
her
like
a
vice
but
for
greater
safety
he
had
bound
a
rope
round
their
two
bodies
and
the
small
mast
of
their
craft
with
his
right
arm
he
clasped
the
mast
low
down
and
his
right
hand
came
round
to
grip
her
shaking
knees
in
this
close
hold
she
lay
a
long
while
without
speaking
then
she
said
faintly
is
it
my
boy
yes
child
did
you
know
i
wanted
to
hear
you
say
it
how
long
have
you
been
in
danger
i
do
know
some
hours
i
thought
you
would
never
come
to
yourself
i
tried
to
come
to
you
i
ca
swim
the
sea
brought
you
to
me
you
were
nearly
drowned
you
slipped
me
once
if
you
had
again
what
would
you
have
done
jumped
in
i
could
have
stayed
on
here
without
you
ah
but
you
must
ever
do
that
promise
promise
for
then
lose
me
for
ever
promise
i
promise
but
there
no
for
ever
of
that
sort
there
no
losing
each
other
whatever
happens
you
know
that
do
you
yes
i
do
know
when
people
love
they
find
each
other
for
ever
but
i
do
want
you
to
die
and
i
do
want
to
die
yet
but
if
it
is
it
will
be
together
will
it
be
do
you
think
i
do
know
dear
the
storm
breaking
up
over
there
but
that
not
the
only
danger
but
nothing
matters
nothing
matters
at
all
while
i
with
you
she
lay
heavily
against
him
her
eyes
closed
and
she
shook
violently
child
you
shuddering
you
as
cold
as
ice
he
put
his
hand
upon
her
chilly
bosom
and
hugged
her
more
fiercely
to
his
own
with
a
sudden
movement
of
despair
and
anger
at
the
little
he
could
do
he
slipped
his
arms
from
his
jacket
and
stripping
open
his
shirt
pulled
her
to
him
his
jacket
around
them
both
tying
it
tightly
about
their
bodies
by
the
empty
sleeves
she
felt
his
lips
on
her
hair
and
heard
him
whisper
you
not
frightened
of
me
are
you
child
you
never
will
be
will
you
she
shook
her
head
and
whispered
i
never
have
been
sleep
if
you
can
dear
i
try
so
closely
was
she
held
by
his
coat
and
his
arms
so
near
she
lay
to
his
beloved
heart
that
she
knew
no
longer
what
part
of
that
union
was
herself
they
were
one
body
and
one
spirit
her
shivering
grew
less
and
with
her
lips
pressed
to
his
neck
she
fell
asleep
it
was
noon
the
hemisphere
of
the
sky
was
an
unbroken
blue
washed
with
a
silver
glare
she
could
not
look
up
the
sea
was
no
longer
wild
but
it
was
not
smooth
it
was
a
dancing
sea
and
every
small
wave
rippled
with
crested
rainbows
a
flight
of
gulls
wheeled
and
screamed
over
their
heads
their
movements
were
so
swift
that
the
seemed
to
be
filled
with
visible
lines
described
by
their
flight
silver
lines
that
gleamed
and
melted
on
transparent
space
like
curved
lightnings
oh
look
oh
look
cried
helen
he
smiled
but
he
was
not
watching
the
gulls
yes
you
never
seen
that
have
you
child
his
eyes
searched
the
distance
but
you
are
looking
what
are
you
looking
at
nothing
i
ca
see
what
i
looking
for
but
the
gulls
might
mean
land
or
icebergs
or
a
ship
i
do
want
land
or
a
ship
or
even
icebergs
said
helen
suddenly
he
looked
at
her
with
the
fleeting
look
that
had
been
her
first
impression
of
him
why
not
why
do
you
i
so
happy
where
i
am
that
all
very
well
said
her
boy
with
his
eyes
on
the
distance
for
awhile
she
lay
enjoying
the
warmth
of
the
sun
watching
the
gulls
sliding
down
the
unseen
slopes
of
the
air
presently
high
up
she
saw
one
hover
and
pause
settling
on
nothingness
by
the
swift
almost
imperceptible
beat
of
its
wings
and
suddenly
it
dropped
like
a
stone
upon
a
wave
and
darted
up
again
so
quickly
that
she
could
not
follow
what
had
happened
what
is
it
doing
she
asked
fishing
said
the
boy
it
wanted
its
dinner
so
do
i
said
helen
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
packet
wrapped
in
oilskin
there
was
biscuit
in
it
he
gave
some
to
her
bit
by
bit
though
it
was
soft
and
dull
she
was
glad
of
it
but
soon
she
drew
away
from
the
hand
that
fed
her
what
the
matter
he
asked
you
must
have
some
too
that
all
right
i
not
greedy
like
you
birds
i
not
a
bird
and
i
not
greedy
being
hungry
not
being
greedy
i
be
greedy
if
i
ate
while
you
hungry
i
not
hungry
then
neither
am
i
to
satisfy
her
he
ate
a
biscuit
soon
after
she
began
to
feel
thirst
but
she
dared
not
ask
for
water
she
knew
he
had
none
he
looked
at
her
lying
pale
in
his
arms
and
said
with
a
smile
that
was
not
like
a
real
smile
it
a
pity
about
the
icebergs
she
smiled
and
nodded
and
lay
still
in
the
heat
watching
the
gulls
and
thinking
of
ice
some
of
the
birds
settled
on
the
raft
one
sat
on
the
mast
another
hovered
at
her
knee
picking
at
crumbs
they
played
in
the
sun
rising
and
falling
and
turned
in
her
vision
into
a
whirl
of
snowflakes
enormous
snowflakes
began
to
dream
of
snow
and
her
lips
parted
in
the
hope
that
some
might
fall
upon
her
tongue
presently
she
ceased
to
dream
of
snow
boy
looked
down
at
her
closed
lids
and
at
her
cheeks
as
white
as
the
breasts
of
the
gulls
he
could
not
bear
to
look
long
and
returned
to
his
distances
it
was
night
again
the
circle
of
the
sea
was
as
smooth
as
silk
pale
light
played
over
it
like
dreams
and
ghosts
the
sky
was
a
crowded
arc
of
stars
millions
of
stars
she
had
never
seen
or
imagined
so
many
they
glittered
glittered
restlessly
in
an
ecstasy
that
caught
her
spirit
she
too
was
filled
with
millions
of
stars
through
her
senses
they
flashed
and
glittered
a
delirium
of
stars
in
heaven
and
her
heart
my
boy
yes
child
do
you
see
the
stars
yes
child
do
you
feel
them
yes
oh
ca
we
die
now
she
felt
him
move
stiffly
there
a
ship
i
certain
of
it
now
certain
oh
if
it
were
day
the
stars
went
on
dazzling
she
did
not
understand
about
the
ship
time
moved
forward
or
stood
still
for
her
the
night
was
timeless
it
was
eternity
but
things
were
happening
outside
in
time
and
space
by
what
means
they
had
been
seen
or
had
attracted
attention
she
did
not
know
but
the
floating
dreamlight
and
the
shivering
starlight
on
the
sea
were
broken
by
a
dark
movement
on
the
waveless
waters
a
boat
was
coming
for
some
time
there
had
been
shouting
and
calling
in
strange
voices
one
of
them
her
boy
but
once
again
she
hovered
on
the
dim
verge
of
consciousness
she
had
flown
from
the
body
he
was
painfully
unbinding
from
his
own
what
he
had
suffered
in
holding
it
there
so
long
she
never
knew
from
leagues
away
she
heard
him
whispering
child
can
you
help
yourself
a
little
and
now
for
an
instant
her
soul
her
body
and
looked
at
him
through
the
soft
midnight
of
her
eyes
and
he
saw
in
them
such
starlight
as
never
was
in
sky
or
on
sea
kiss
me
said
helen
he
kissed
her
with
a
great
effort
she
lifted
herself
and
stood
upright
on
the
raft
swaying
a
little
and
holding
by
the
mast
the
boat
was
still
a
little
distant
my
boy
child
do
jump
you
promised
not
to
you
promised
but
i
ca
come
with
you
now
you
must
let
me
go
he
looked
at
her
and
saw
she
was
in
a
fever
he
made
a
desperate
clutch
at
her
blue
gown
but
he
was
not
quick
enough
keep
your
promise
she
cried
and
disappeared
in
the
dreamlit
waters
she
disappeared
like
a
dream
without
a
sound
as
she
sank
she
heard
him
calling
her
by
the
only
name
he
knew
when
she
was
her
father
died
now
she
was
free
to
go
where
she
pleased
but
she
did
not
go
anywhere
ever
since
as
a
child
she
had
first
tasted
salt
water
she
had
longed
to
travel
and
see
other
lands
what
held
her
now
was
it
that
her
longing
had
been
satisfied
that
she
had
a
host
of
memories
of
great
mountains
and
golden
shores
of
jungles
and
strange
cities
of
the
coast
of
islands
lost
in
seas
of
sapphire
and
emerald
of
caravans
and
towers
of
ivory
of
haunted
caverns
and
deserted
temples
where
a
child
always
with
her
darling
boy
she
had
had
such
adventures
as
would
have
filled
a
hundred
earthly
lives
they
had
built
huts
in
uninhabited
places
or
made
a
twisted
bower
of
strong
green
creepers
and
lived
their
primitive
paradisal
life
wanting
nothing
but
each
other
sometimes
through
accidents
and
illness
they
had
nursed
each
other
with
such
unwearied
tenderness
that
death
himself
had
to
withdraw
defeated
by
love
once
on
a
ship
there
had
been
mutiny
and
she
alone
stood
by
him
against
a
throng
once
savages
had
captured
her
and
he
outwitting
them
had
rescued
her
riding
through
leagues
of
and
forest
holding
her
before
him
on
the
saddle
in
nearly
all
these
adventures
it
was
as
though
they
had
met
for
the
first
time
and
were
struck
anew
with
the
dumb
wonder
of
first
love
and
the
strange
shy
sweetness
of
wooing
and
confession
yet
they
were
but
playing
above
truth
for
the
knowledge
was
always
between
them
that
they
were
bound
immortally
by
a
love
which
having
no
end
seemed
also
to
have
had
no
beginning
they
quarreled
sometimes
this
was
playing
too
she
put
now
herself
now
him
in
the
wrong
and
either
reconciliation
was
sweet
but
it
was
she
who
was
oftenest
at
fault
his
forgiveness
was
so
dear
to
her
and
still
this
was
but
playing
at
it
when
all
these
adventures
and
pretenses
were
done
they
stood
heart
to
heart
and
out
of
their
only
meeting
in
life
built
up
eternal
truth
and
told
each
other
they
told
it
inexhaustibly
and
so
when
her
father
left
her
free
to
go
helen
lived
on
still
in
the
mill
of
dreams
and
kept
her
millstones
grinding
two
years
went
by
and
her
hard
gray
lonely
life
laid
its
hand
on
her
hair
and
her
countenance
her
father
had
worn
her
out
before
her
time
it
was
only
invisible
grain
in
the
mill
now
the
peasants
came
no
longer
with
their
corn
she
had
enough
to
live
on
and
her
long
seclusion
unfitted
her
for
strange
men
in
the
mill
and
people
she
must
talk
to
and
so
long
was
the
habit
of
the
recluse
on
her
that
though
her
soul
flew
leagues
her
body
never
wandered
more
than
a
few
hundred
yards
from
her
home
some
who
had
heard
of
her
and
had
glimpses
of
her
spoke
to
her
when
they
met
but
they
could
make
no
headway
with
this
sweet
shy
silent
woman
yet
children
and
boys
and
girls
felt
drawn
to
her
it
was
the
dream
in
her
eyes
that
stirred
the
love
in
their
hearts
though
they
knew
it
no
more
than
the
soup
in
the
pipkin
knows
why
it
bubbles
and
boils
for
it
can
not
see
the
fire
but
to
them
she
did
not
seem
old
her
strength
and
eagerness
were
still
upon
her
and
that
silver
needlework
with
which
time
broiders
all
men
had
in
her
its
special
beauty
setting
her
aloof
in
the
unabandoned
dream
which
the
young
so
often
desert
as
their
youth
deserts
them
those
of
her
age
seeing
that
unyouthful
gleam
of
her
hair
combined
with
the
dream
of
her
eyes
felt
as
though
they
could
not
touch
her
for
no
man
can
break
another
web
he
can
only
break
his
own
and
these
had
torn
their
films
to
tatters
long
ago
and
shouldered
their
way
through
the
smudgy
rents
and
no
more
walked
where
she
walked
but
very
young
people
knew
the
places
she
walked
in
and
saw
her
clearly
for
they
walked
there
too
though
they
were
growing
up
and
she
was
growing
old
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
there
was
a
storm
it
lasted
three
days
without
stopping
such
fury
of
rain
and
thunder
she
had
never
heard
the
gaunt
rooms
of
the
mill
were
steeped
in
gloom
except
when
lightning
stared
through
the
flat
windows
or
split
into
fierce
cracks
on
the
dingy
glass
those
three
days
she
spent
by
outside
the
world
seemed
to
lie
under
a
dark
doom
on
the
third
morning
she
woke
early
she
had
had
restless
nights
but
now
and
then
slept
heavily
and
out
of
one
dull
slumber
she
awakened
to
the
certainty
that
something
strange
had
happened
the
storm
had
lulled
at
last
through
her
window
set
high
in
the
wall
she
could
see
the
dead
light
of
a
blank
gray
dawn
she
had
seen
other
eyeless
mornings
on
her
windowpane
but
this
was
different
the
air
in
her
room
was
different
something
unknown
had
been
taken
from
or
added
to
it
as
she
lay
there
wondering
but
not
yet
willing
to
discover
the
flat
light
at
the
window
was
blocked
out
a
seagull
beat
against
it
with
its
wings
and
settled
on
the
sill
the
flutter
and
the
settling
of
the
bird
overcame
her
it
was
as
though
reality
were
more
than
she
could
bear
the
birds
of
memory
and
pain
flew
through
her
heart
she
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
the
gull
did
not
move
it
was
broken
and
exhausted
by
the
storm
and
beyond
it
she
looked
down
upon
the
sea
yes
it
was
true
the
sea
itself
washed
at
the
walls
of
the
mill
she
did
not
understand
these
waters
she
knew
them
in
vision
not
in
reality
she
cried
out
sharply
and
threw
the
window
up
the
draggled
bird
fluttered
in
and
sank
on
the
floor
a
blew
in
with
it
the
bird
wings
shivered
on
her
feet
and
the
wind
on
her
bosom
she
stared
over
the
land
swallowed
up
in
the
sea
wreckage
of
all
sorts
tossed
and
floated
on
it
fences
and
broken
gates
and
branches
of
trees
and
fragments
of
boats
and
nets
and
bits
of
cork
and
grass
and
flowers
and
seaweed
she
thought
what
did
she
think
she
thought
she
must
be
dreaming
she
felt
like
one
drowning
where
could
she
find
a
shore
she
hurried
to
the
bed
and
got
her
shell
its
touch
on
her
heart
was
her
first
safety
in
her
nightgown
as
she
was
she
ran
with
her
naked
feet
through
the
dim
passages
until
she
stood
beside
the
grinding
stones
child
child
child
where
are
you
my
boy
where
are
you
are
you
coming
must
i
lose
you
after
all
this
oh
come
but
tell
me
where
you
are
in
a
few
hours
i
should
have
been
with
you
a
few
hours
after
many
years
oh
boy
for
pity
tell
me
where
to
find
you
you
are
there
waiting
for
me
are
you
child
i
know
you
are
always
known
you
were
what
would
you
have
said
to
me
when
you
opened
the
door
in
your
blue
gown
oh
but
say
only
where
you
are
my
boy
do
you
know
what
i
should
have
said
i
should
have
said
anything
i
should
have
kissed
you
oh
let
me
come
to
you
and
you
shall
kiss
me
but
she
listened
in
vain
she
went
back
to
her
room
the
gull
was
still
on
the
floor
its
wing
was
broken
her
actions
from
this
moment
were
mechanical
she
did
what
she
did
without
will
first
she
bound
the
broken
wing
and
fetched
bread
and
water
for
the
wounded
bird
then
she
dressed
herself
and
went
out
of
the
mill
she
had
a
rope
in
her
hands
the
water
was
not
all
around
the
mill
strips
and
stretches
of
land
were
still
unflooded
or
only
thinly
covered
but
the
face
of
the
earth
had
been
altered
by
one
of
those
great
inland
swoops
of
the
sea
that
have
for
centuries
changed
and
the
point
of
sussex
advancing
receding
shifting
the
making
new
shores
restoring
old
fields
wedding
the
soil
with
the
sand
helen
walked
where
she
could
she
had
no
choice
of
ways
she
kept
by
the
edge
of
the
water
and
went
into
land
a
bank
of
rotting
grasses
and
dry
reeds
which
the
waves
had
left
uncovered
rose
from
the
marshes
she
mounted
it
and
beheld
the
unnatural
sea
on
either
hand
here
and
there
in
the
desolate
water
mounds
of
grass
lifted
themselves
like
drifting
islands
trees
stricken
or
still
in
leaf
reared
from
the
unfamiliar
element
many
of
those
which
were
leafless
had
put
on
a
strange
greenness
for
their
boughs
dripped
with
seaweed
over
the
floods
which
were
littered
with
such
flotsam
as
she
had
seen
from
her
window
flew
and
crying
and
cheeping
there
was
no
other
presence
in
that
desolation
except
her
own
and
then
at
last
her
commanded
feet
stood
still
and
her
will
came
back
to
her
for
she
saw
what
she
had
come
to
find
he
was
hanging
as
though
it
had
caught
him
in
a
snare
in
a
tree
standing
solitary
in
the
middle
of
a
wide
waste
of
water
he
was
hanging
there
like
a
dead
man
she
could
distinguish
his
dark
red
hair
and
his
blue
jersey
she
paused
to
think
what
to
do
she
could
swim
she
would
not
have
hesitated
to
try
but
she
wanted
to
save
him
she
looked
about
and
saw
among
the
bits
of
stuff
washing
against
the
foot
of
the
bank
a
large
dismembered
it
bobbed
back
and
forth
among
the
hollow
reeds
she
thought
it
would
serve
her
if
she
had
an
oar
she
went
in
search
of
one
and
found
a
broken
plank
cast
up
among
the
tangled
growth
of
the
bank
when
she
had
secured
it
she
fastened
one
end
of
her
rope
around
the
stump
of
an
old
pollard
squatting
on
the
bank
like
a
sturdy
gnome
and
the
other
end
she
knotted
around
herself
then
gathering
all
the
middle
of
the
rope
into
a
coil
and
using
her
plank
as
a
prop
she
let
herself
down
the
bank
and
slid
shuddering
into
the
water
but
she
had
her
now
with
some
difficulty
she
scrambled
on
to
it
and
paddled
her
way
into
the
open
water
it
was
not
really
a
great
distance
to
his
tree
but
to
her
it
seemed
immeasurable
she
was
unskillful
and
her
awkwardness
often
put
her
into
danger
but
her
will
made
her
do
what
she
otherwise
might
not
have
done
presently
she
was
under
the
branches
of
the
tree
she
pulled
herself
up
to
a
limb
beside
him
and
looked
at
him
and
it
was
not
he
it
was
not
her
boy
it
was
a
man
rough
and
weatherbeaten
but
pallid
under
his
his
hair
was
grizzled
and
his
face
was
rough
with
a
growth
of
grizzled
hair
his
whole
body
lurched
heavily
and
helplessly
in
a
fork
of
the
tree
and
one
arm
hung
limp
his
eyes
were
but
they
were
not
quite
shut
he
was
not
unconscious
and
under
the
drooping
lids
he
was
watching
her
for
a
few
minutes
they
sat
gazing
at
each
other
in
silence
she
had
her
breath
to
get
she
thought
it
would
never
come
back
the
man
spoke
first
well
you
made
a
job
of
it
he
said
she
did
answer
but
you
do
know
much
about
the
water
do
you
i
never
seen
the
sea
till
said
helen
slowly
he
laughed
a
little
i
expect
you
seen
enough
of
it
but
where
do
you
live
then
that
you
never
seen
the
sea
in
the
middle
of
the
earth
no
said
helen
i
live
in
a
mill
his
eyelids
flickered
do
you
yes
of
course
you
do
i
might
have
guessed
it
how
should
you
guess
it
by
your
blue
dress
said
the
man
then
he
fainted
she
sat
there
miserably
waiting
ready
to
prop
him
if
he
fell
she
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
before
very
long
he
opened
his
eyes
did
i
go
off
again
he
asked
she
nodded
yes
well
it
time
to
be
making
a
move
i
dare
say
i
can
now
here
what
your
name
helen
well
helen
we
better
put
that
rope
to
some
use
will
that
tree
at
the
other
end
hold
yes
then
just
you
untie
yourself
and
we
get
aboard
and
haul
ourselves
home
she
unfastened
the
rope
from
her
body
and
helped
him
down
to
her
makeshift
boat
you
take
the
paddle
he
said
my
arm
damaged
but
i
can
pull
on
the
rope
with
the
other
are
you
sure
are
you
all
right
what
your
name
yes
i
can
manage
my
name
peter
this
would
have
been
a
lark
thirty
years
ago
would
it
it
rather
a
lark
now
she
nodded
vaguely
wondering
what
she
would
do
if
he
fell
off
the
log
in
suppose
you
faint
again
do
look
for
trouble
said
the
man
push
off
now
pulling
and
paddling
they
got
to
the
bank
he
took
her
up
it
and
she
saw
by
his
movements
that
he
was
very
feeble
he
leaned
on
her
as
they
went
back
to
the
mill
they
walked
without
speaking
when
they
reached
the
door
peter
said
it
twenty
years
since
i
was
here
but
i
expect
you
do
remember
oh
yes
said
helen
i
remember
do
you
now
said
peter
it
funny
you
should
remember
and
with
that
he
did
faint
again
and
this
time
when
he
recovered
he
was
in
a
fever
his
was
gone
she
put
him
to
bed
and
nursed
him
she
sat
day
and
night
in
his
room
doing
by
instinct
what
was
right
and
needful
at
first
he
lay
either
unconscious
or
delirious
she
listened
to
his
incoherent
speech
in
a
sort
of
agony
as
though
it
might
contain
some
clue
to
a
riddle
and
sat
with
her
passionate
eyes
brooding
on
his
countenance
as
though
in
that
too
might
lie
the
answer
but
if
there
was
one
neither
his
words
nor
his
face
revealed
it
when
he
wakes
she
whispered
to
herself
he
tell
me
how
can
there
be
barriers
between
us
any
more
after
three
days
he
came
to
himself
she
was
sitting
by
the
window
preparing
for
her
spindle
she
bent
over
her
task
using
the
last
of
the
light
which
fell
upon
her
head
she
did
not
know
that
he
was
conscious
or
had
been
watching
her
until
he
spoke
your
hair
used
to
be
quite
brown
did
it
he
said
she
started
and
turned
to
him
and
a
faint
flush
stained
her
cheeks
ah
you
not
pleased
said
peter
with
a
slight
grin
none
of
us
like
getting
old
do
we
helen
put
by
the
question
you
yourself
again
doing
my
best
said
he
how
long
is
it
three
days
as
much
as
that
i
could
have
sworn
it
was
only
yesterday
well
time
passes
he
said
no
more
and
fell
into
a
doze
helen
was
as
grateful
for
this
as
she
could
have
been
for
anything
just
then
she
could
have
gone
on
talking
she
was
stunned
with
misgivings
how
could
he
ever
have
thought
her
hair
was
brown
could
he
see
even
now
that
it
had
once
been
as
black
as
jet
she
put
her
hand
up
to
her
head
and
unpinned
a
coil
of
her
heavy
hair
and
spread
it
over
her
breast
and
looked
at
it
yes
the
silver
was
there
too
much
and
too
soon
but
there
was
less
silver
than
black
it
was
still
time
stitchery
not
his
fabric
the
man
who
was
not
her
boy
need
never
have
seen
her
before
to
know
that
once
her
hair
had
been
black
this
was
worse
than
forgetfulness
in
him
it
was
misremembrance
she
pulled
at
the
silver
hairs
passionately
as
though
she
would
pluck
them
out
and
make
him
see
her
as
she
had
been
but
soon
she
stopped
her
futile
effort
to
uncount
the
years
i
am
foolish
she
whispered
to
herself
and
coiled
her
lock
again
and
bound
it
in
its
place
there
are
other
ways
of
making
him
remember
presently
when
he
wakes
again
i
will
talk
to
him
i
will
remind
him
of
everything
yes
and
i
tell
him
everything
i
wo
be
afraid
she
waited
with
longing
his
next
consciousness
but
to
her
woe
she
found
herself
defeated
while
he
slept
she
was
able
as
when
he
had
been
delirious
or
absent
to
create
the
occasion
and
the
talk
between
them
she
dropped
all
fears
and
in
frank
tenderness
brought
him
her
twenty
years
of
dreams
and
in
her
thought
he
accepted
and
answered
them
but
when
he
woke
and
spoke
to
her
from
the
bed
she
knew
at
once
that
the
man
who
lay
there
was
not
the
man
with
whom
she
had
been
speaking
his
personality
fenced
with
hers
it
had
barriers
she
could
not
pass
she
dared
not
try
for
dread
of
his
indifference
or
his
smiles
what
made
you
stick
on
in
this
place
he
asked
her
i
do
know
said
helen
places
hold
one
do
they
none
ever
held
me
i
could
have
been
content
to
stay
the
best
half
of
my
life
in
one
spot
but
i
suppose
women
are
different
you
speak
as
though
all
women
were
the
same
are
they
i
thought
they
might
be
i
do
know
much
about
them
said
peter
rubbing
his
chin
rough
as
a
porcupine
are
i
you
must
have
thought
me
a
savage
when
you
found
me
stuck
in
that
tree
like
a
sloth
what
did
you
think
she
looked
at
him
longing
to
tell
him
what
she
had
thought
she
longed
to
tell
him
of
the
boy
she
had
expected
to
find
in
the
tree
she
longed
to
tell
him
how
the
finding
had
shocked
her
by
bringing
home
to
her
her
loss
not
of
the
boy
but
of
something
in
that
moment
still
more
precious
to
her
because
she
longed
to
tell
him
she
had
so
swiftly
rediscovered
the
lost
boy
not
in
his
face
but
in
his
glance
not
in
his
words
but
in
the
tones
of
his
voice
but
when
she
looked
at
him
and
saw
him
leaning
on
his
elbow
waiting
for
her
answer
with
his
lids
and
the
on
his
lips
she
answered
only
i
was
thinking
how
to
get
you
back
to
the
bank
was
that
it
well
you
managed
it
i
never
thanked
you
have
i
do
said
helen
with
a
quick
breath
and
looked
out
of
the
window
he
waited
for
a
few
moments
and
then
said
i
a
bad
hand
at
thanking
i
ca
help
being
a
savage
you
know
i
not
fit
for
women
company
i
do
look
so
rough
when
i
trimmed
i
do
want
to
be
thanked
said
helen
controlling
her
voice
and
added
with
a
faint
smile
no
one
looks
his
best
when
he
wait
till
i
well
grinned
peter
and
see
if
i
not
fit
to
walk
you
out
o
sundays
he
lay
back
on
his
pillow
and
whistled
a
snatch
of
tune
her
heart
almost
stopped
beating
because
it
was
the
tune
he
had
whistled
at
the
door
twenty
years
ago
for
a
moment
she
thought
she
could
speak
to
him
as
she
wished
but
desire
choked
her
power
to
choose
her
words
so
many
rushed
through
her
brain
that
she
had
to
pause
seeking
which
of
them
to
utter
and
that
long
pause
in
which
she
really
seemed
to
have
uttered
them
all
aloud
checked
the
impulse
but
surely
he
had
heard
her
no
for
she
had
not
spoken
yet
and
before
she
could
make
the
effort
he
had
stopped
whistling
and
when
she
looked
at
him
to
speak
he
was
fumbling
restlessly
about
his
pillow
what
is
it
she
asked
something
i
had
where
my
clothes
she
brought
them
to
him
and
he
searched
them
till
he
had
found
among
them
a
small
metal
box
which
he
thrust
under
the
pillow
and
then
he
lay
back
as
though
too
tired
to
notice
her
so
her
impulse
died
in
her
unacted
on
and
during
the
next
four
days
it
was
always
so
a
dozen
times
in
their
talks
she
tried
to
come
near
him
and
could
not
was
it
because
he
would
not
let
her
or
because
the
thing
she
wished
to
find
in
him
was
not
really
there
sometimes
by
his
manner
only
and
sometimes
by
his
words
he
baffled
her
when
she
attempted
to
approach
him
and
the
attempt
had
been
so
painful
to
conceive
and
its
was
such
agony
to
her
he
would
talk
frequently
of
the
time
when
he
would
be
making
tracks
again
where
to
asked
helen
i
leave
it
to
chance
i
always
have
i
never
made
plans
or
very
seldom
and
i
not
often
twice
in
the
same
place
you
look
tired
sorry
to
be
a
bother
to
you
but
it
be
for
the
last
time
most
likely
go
and
lie
down
i
do
want
to
said
helen
under
her
breath
and
in
her
thoughts
she
was
crying
the
last
time
then
it
must
be
soon
soon
i
make
you
listen
to
me
now
i
want
to
sleep
said
peter
she
left
the
room
tears
of
helplessness
and
misery
filled
her
eyes
she
was
almost
angry
with
him
but
more
angry
with
herself
but
her
was
mixed
with
shame
she
was
ashamed
that
he
made
her
feel
so
much
while
he
felt
nothing
did
he
feel
nothing
it
my
stupidity
that
keeps
us
apart
she
whispered
i
will
break
through
it
as
quickly
as
she
had
left
him
she
returned
and
stood
by
the
bed
he
was
lying
with
his
hand
pressed
over
his
eyes
when
he
was
conscious
of
her
being
there
his
hand
fell
and
his
keen
eyes
shot
into
hers
his
brows
contracted
you
nuisance
he
muttered
and
hid
his
eyes
again
she
turned
and
left
him
when
she
got
outside
the
door
she
leaned
against
it
and
shook
from
head
to
foot
she
hovered
on
the
brink
of
her
delusions
and
felt
as
though
she
would
soon
crash
into
a
precipice
she
longed
for
him
to
go
before
she
fell
yes
she
began
to
long
for
the
time
when
he
should
go
and
end
this
pain
and
leave
her
to
the
old
strange
life
that
had
been
so
sweet
his
living
presence
killed
it
after
that
third
day
she
had
had
no
more
fears
for
his
safety
and
he
was
strong
and
rallied
quickly
the
gull
too
was
saved
he
saved
it
it
had
drooped
and
sickened
with
her
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
on
the
fourth
day
as
he
was
so
much
better
she
brought
it
to
him
he
reset
its
wing
and
kept
it
by
him
making
it
his
patient
and
his
playfellow
it
thrived
at
once
and
grew
tame
to
his
hand
he
fondled
and
talked
to
it
like
a
lover
she
would
watch
him
silently
with
her
smoldering
eyes
as
he
fed
and
caressed
the
bird
and
jabbered
to
it
in
scraps
of
a
dozen
foreign
tongues
his
tenderness
smote
her
heart
you
not
very
fond
of
birds
he
said
to
her
once
when
she
had
been
sitting
in
one
of
her
silences
while
he
played
with
his
pet
the
words
question
or
statement
filled
her
with
anger
she
would
not
trust
herself
to
protest
or
deny
i
do
know
much
about
them
she
said
that
a
pity
said
peter
coolly
the
more
you
know
em
the
more
you
have
to
love
em
yet
you
could
love
them
for
all
sorts
of
things
without
knowing
them
i
have
thought
she
said
nothing
for
their
beauty
now
that
worth
loving
look
at
this
one
you
a
beauty
all
right
are
you
my
pretty
not
many
girls
to
match
you
he
paused
and
ran
his
finger
down
the
bird
throat
and
breast
perhaps
you
do
think
she
beautiful
he
said
to
helen
yes
she
beautiful
said
helen
with
a
difficulty
that
sounded
like
reluctance
ah
you
do
think
so
you
ought
to
see
her
flying
you
shall
some
day
when
her
hurt
mended
she
fly
i
let
her
go
perhaps
she
wo
go
said
helen
oh
yes
she
will
how
can
she
stop
in
a
place
like
this
this
is
no
air
for
her
she
must
fly
in
her
own
you
be
sorry
to
see
her
go
said
helen
to
see
her
free
no
not
a
bit
i
want
her
to
fly
why
should
i
keep
her
i
not
let
her
keep
me
i
hate
her
for
it
why
should
i
make
her
hate
me
perhaps
she
would
said
helen
in
a
low
voice
oh
i
expect
she
would
ungrateful
little
beggar
i
saved
her
life
and
she
ought
to
know
she
belongs
to
me
so
she
might
stay
out
of
gratitude
but
she
come
to
hate
me
for
it
all
the
same
not
at
first
after
a
bit
because
we
change
bound
to
are
we
perhaps
i
know
i
do
we
can
none
of
us
stay
what
we
were
you
have
either
you
have
much
to
go
by
said
helen
seven
minutes
at
the
door
was
it
this
time
it
been
seven
days
yes
it
a
long
time
for
me
said
peter
it
not
much
out
of
a
lifetime
no
but
suppose
it
were
more
than
seven
days
helen
looked
at
him
and
said
slowly
it
will
be
wo
it
you
be
able
to
go
no
said
peter
not
or
next
day
perhaps
perhaps
i
be
able
to
go
for
the
rest
of
my
life
this
time
helen
looked
at
him
and
said
nothing
peter
stroked
his
bird
and
whistled
his
tune
and
stopped
abruptly
and
said
will
you
marry
me
helen
i
rather
die
said
helen
and
she
got
up
and
went
out
of
the
room
oh
the
green
grass
chuckled
martin
like
a
bird
nobody
asked
her
you
to
begin
a
song
master
pippin
quavered
jennifer
it
was
not
the
beginning
of
a
song
mistress
jennifer
it
was
the
epilogue
of
a
story
but
the
epilogue
comes
at
the
end
of
a
story
said
jennifer
and
has
my
story
come
to
its
end
said
martin
joscelyn
ridiculous
oh
dear
there
no
bearing
with
you
how
can
this
be
the
end
how
can
it
be
with
him
on
one
side
of
the
door
and
her
on
the
other
joyce
and
her
heart
breaking
you
must
make
an
end
of
that
jennifer
and
you
must
tell
us
the
end
of
the
shell
jessica
and
of
the
millstones
jane
what
did
he
have
in
his
box
please
said
little
joan
tell
us
whether
she
ever
found
her
boy
again
oh
please
tell
us
the
end
of
her
dreams
do
these
things
matter
said
martin
has
he
asked
her
to
marry
him
but
she
said
no
said
jennifer
with
tears
in
her
eyes
did
she
said
martin
who
said
so
master
pippin
said
joscelyn
and
her
voice
shook
with
the
agitation
of
her
anger
tell
us
immediately
the
things
we
want
to
know
when
i
wonder
said
martin
will
women
cease
to
want
to
know
little
things
more
than
big
ones
however
i
suppose
they
must
be
indulged
in
little
things
lest
lest
said
little
joan
there
is
such
a
thing
said
martin
as
playing
for
safety
well
then
my
dear
maids
when
helen
ran
out
of
his
room
she
went
to
her
own
and
she
threw
herself
on
the
bed
and
sobbed
without
weeping
because
everything
in
her
life
seemed
to
have
been
taken
away
from
her
she
lay
there
for
a
long
time
and
when
she
moved
at
last
her
head
was
so
heavy
that
she
took
the
pins
from
her
hair
to
relieve
herself
of
its
weight
but
still
the
pain
weighed
on
her
forehead
which
burned
on
her
cold
fingers
when
she
pressed
them
over
her
eyes
trying
to
think
and
find
some
gleam
of
hope
among
her
despairing
thoughts
and
then
she
remembered
that
one
thing
at
least
was
left
her
her
shell
during
his
illness
she
had
never
carried
it
to
the
millstones
it
was
as
though
his
being
there
had
been
the
only
answer
to
her
daily
dreams
an
answer
that
had
failed
them
all
the
time
but
now
in
spite
of
him
she
would
try
to
find
the
old
answers
again
so
she
went
once
more
to
the
millstones
with
her
shell
and
when
she
got
there
she
held
it
so
tightly
to
her
heart
that
it
marked
her
skin
and
the
millstones
had
nothing
to
say
for
the
first
time
they
refused
to
grind
her
corn
then
helen
knew
that
she
really
had
nothing
left
and
that
the
of
the
man
had
robbed
her
of
her
boy
and
of
the
child
she
had
been
nothing
was
left
but
the
man
and
woman
who
had
lost
their
youth
and
the
man
had
nothing
to
give
the
woman
nothing
but
gratitude
and
disillusion
and
now
a
still
bitterer
thought
came
to
her
the
thought
that
the
boy
had
had
nothing
to
give
the
girl
for
twenty
years
it
had
been
the
girl
illusion
the
storms
in
her
heart
broke
out
she
put
her
face
in
her
hands
and
wept
like
wild
rain
on
the
sea
she
wept
so
violently
that
between
her
passion
and
the
speechless
grinding
of
the
stones
she
did
not
hear
him
coming
she
only
knew
he
was
there
when
he
put
his
arm
round
her
what
is
it
you
silly
thing
said
peter
she
looked
up
at
him
through
her
hair
that
fell
like
a
girl
in
soft
masses
on
either
side
of
her
face
there
was
a
change
in
him
but
she
did
know
then
what
it
was
he
had
got
into
his
clothes
and
made
himself
kempt
his
beard
was
no
longer
rough
though
his
hair
was
still
unruly
across
his
forehead
and
under
it
his
eyes
looked
into
hers
his
face
was
rather
pale
and
he
was
a
little
unsteady
in
his
weakness
but
the
look
in
his
eyes
was
the
only
thing
she
saw
it
unlocked
her
speech
at
last
oh
why
did
you
come
back
she
cried
why
did
you
come
back
if
you
had
never
come
i
should
have
kept
my
dream
to
the
end
of
my
life
but
now
even
when
you
go
i
shall
never
get
it
again
you
have
destroyed
what
was
not
there
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
still
keeping
his
arm
round
her
then
he
said
look
what
here
and
he
opened
his
hand
and
showed
her
his
metal
box
without
its
lid
in
it
were
the
mummies
of
seven
ears
of
corn
some
were
only
husks
but
some
had
grain
in
them
still
she
stared
at
them
through
her
tears
and
drew
from
her
breast
her
hand
with
the
shell
in
it
suddenly
her
mouth
quivered
and
she
cried
passionately
what
the
use
and
she
snatched
the
old
corn
from
him
and
flung
it
to
the
millstones
with
her
shell
and
the
millstones
ground
them
to
eternal
atoms
my
boy
my
boy
it
was
you
over
there
in
the
tree
oh
child
you
came
at
last
in
your
blue
gown
why
did
you
call
to
me
i
no
breath
i
was
spent
and
i
knew
you
seen
me
and
would
do
your
best
i
never
forget
that
sight
of
you
in
the
tree
with
your
old
jersey
and
your
hair
as
red
as
ever
i
shall
always
see
your
free
young
figure
standing
on
the
high
bank
against
the
sky
oh
i
was
desperate
i
wondered
what
you
do
i
knew
you
do
something
i
thought
i
never
get
across
the
water
do
you
know
what
i
thought
as
i
saw
you
coming
so
bravely
and
so
badly
i
thought
i
teach
her
to
swim
one
day
shall
i
child
i
ca
swim
without
you
my
boy
she
whispered
but
you
pretended
not
to
know
me
i
could
help
it
it
was
such
fun
how
could
you
make
fun
of
me
then
i
always
shall
you
know
oh
yes
she
said
do
always
what
did
you
think
when
you
saw
me
in
the
tree
what
did
you
see
when
you
got
there
not
what
you
expected
no
i
saw
twenty
years
come
flying
upon
me
twenty
years
i
forgotten
all
about
because
for
me
it
has
always
been
twenty
years
ago
and
you
expected
to
see
a
boy
and
you
saw
a
grizzled
man
no
said
helen
her
eyes
shining
with
tears
i
expected
to
see
a
boy
and
i
saw
a
woman
i
seen
her
ever
since
i
only
seen
her
once
said
peter
i
saw
her
rise
up
from
the
water
and
sit
in
my
tree
and
when
she
spoke
and
looked
at
me
it
was
a
child
he
put
his
hand
over
her
wet
eyes
you
must
stop
seeing
her
child
he
said
when
i
told
you
my
name
were
you
disappointed
no
it
the
loveliest
name
in
the
world
you
said
it
at
once
i
had
to
i
wanted
to
say
it
for
twenty
years
but
i
say
it
often
helen
wo
you
no
child
now
and
then
for
a
treat
she
looked
up
at
him
oh
you
can
smile
can
you
you
were
to
teach
me
that
too
yes
i
a
lot
to
teach
you
have
i
i
yet
to
teach
you
to
say
my
name
have
you
you
never
said
it
once
i
said
it
a
thousand
times
you
never
let
me
hear
you
have
i
let
me
hear
you
peter
say
it
again
peter
peter
peter
again
my
boy
when
we
got
back
to
the
the
last
of
the
twenty
years
that
had
been
melting
faster
and
faster
melted
away
for
ever
and
you
and
i
were
standing
there
as
we
stood
then
and
i
wanted
to
kiss
your
mouth
as
i
wanted
to
then
oh
why
did
you
both
times
shall
i
now
for
both
times
oh
oh
that
for
a
hundred
times
think
of
all
the
times
i
wanted
to
and
been
without
you
you
never
been
without
me
i
know
that
how
often
i
came
to
the
mill
did
you
come
to
the
mill
as
often
as
i
ate
your
grain
did
you
know
i
know
how
often
your
sea
brought
me
to
you
did
it
and
oh
my
boy
at
last
the
sea
brought
you
to
me
and
the
mill
he
said
where
has
that
brought
us
i
thought
perhaps
you
die
i
could
have
died
so
close
on
finding
you
i
was
fighting
the
demons
all
the
time
fighting
my
way
through
to
you
and
at
last
i
opened
my
eyes
and
saw
you
again
your
black
hair
edged
with
light
against
the
window
my
black
hair
you
mean
my
brown
hair
do
you
oh
were
you
cross
i
loved
you
for
being
cross
i
was
cross
why
will
you
keep
on
saying
i
things
i
not
you
were
so
cross
that
you
pretended
our
twenty
years
were
sixty
i
never
said
anything
about
twenty
years
or
sixty
you
did
though
sixty
why
in
sixty
years
we
have
been
very
nearly
old
so
to
punish
you
i
pretended
to
go
to
sleep
and
i
saw
you
take
your
hair
down
it
was
so
beautiful
you
seen
the
threads
spiders
spin
on
blackened
furze
that
gypsies
have
set
fire
to
your
hair
was
like
that
you
were
angry
with
those
lovely
lines
of
silver
and
you
wanted
to
get
rid
of
them
i
nearly
called
to
you
to
stop
hurting
what
i
loved
so
much
but
you
stopped
of
yourself
as
though
you
had
heard
me
before
i
called
i
was
ashamed
of
myself
whispered
helen
i
was
ashamed
of
trying
to
be
again
what
i
was
the
only
other
time
you
saw
me
you
never
stopped
being
that
child
said
peter
you
knew
did
you
why
it
was
i
had
stayed
on
at
the
mill
you
knew
what
it
was
that
held
me
and
why
i
could
never
leave
it
yes
i
knew
it
held
you
because
it
held
me
too
i
wondered
if
tell
me
that
i
longed
to
but
i
could
i
never
been
able
to
tell
you
things
and
i
never
shall
oh
child
do
look
so
troubled
you
always
told
me
things
and
always
will
do
you
think
it
with
our
tongues
we
tell
each
other
things
what
can
words
ever
tell
they
only
circle
round
the
truth
like
birds
flying
in
the
sun
the
light
bathes
their
flight
yet
they
are
millions
of
miles
away
from
the
light
they
fly
in
we
listen
to
each
other
words
but
we
watch
each
other
eyes
some
people
their
eyes
peter
some
people
helen
ca
shut
their
eyes
at
all
your
eyes
will
never
stop
telling
me
things
and
the
strangest
thing
about
them
is
that
looking
into
them
is
like
being
able
to
see
in
the
dark
they
are
darkness
not
light
and
in
darkness
dreams
are
born
when
i
look
into
your
eyes
i
go
into
your
dream
i
shall
never
shut
my
eyes
again
she
whispered
i
will
keep
you
in
my
dream
for
ever
women
are
all
the
same
peter
are
they
and
yet
they
are
well
i
give
it
up
did
you
know
no
i
told
you
the
truth
that
time
i
not
had
very
much
to
do
with
women
then
i
something
to
teach
you
peter
i
do
know
what
you
can
prove
said
peter
one
woman
by
herself
ca
prove
a
difference
ca
she
said
helen
and
laughed
and
cried
at
once
but
why
did
you
call
me
a
nuisance
you
were
one
you
are
one
you
leave
a
man
no
peace
you
like
the
sea
you
full
of
storms
are
you
not
only
storms
i
know
but
the
sea
would
be
the
sea
without
her
storms
one
of
her
ways
of
holding
us
too
and
there
are
more
storms
in
her
than
ever
break
i
see
them
in
you
big
ones
and
little
ones
brooding
then
you
a
nuisance
you
always
will
be
wo
you
not
to
wreck
you
you
wo
do
that
or
if
you
do
i
can
survive
shipwreck
i
know
how
do
you
know
i
nearly
gave
up
once
but
the
thought
of
you
stopped
me
i
wanted
to
come
back
i
always
meant
to
so
i
held
on
i
know
how
do
you
know
i
never
told
you
did
i
oh
peter
the
things
we
have
to
tell
each
other
the
times
you
thought
you
were
alone
the
times
i
thought
i
was
you
had
a
life
you
never
dreamed
of
and
i
another
life
that
was
not
in
my
dreams
you
saved
me
from
death
more
than
once
said
peter
you
done
more
than
that
said
helen
you
given
me
the
only
life
i
had
but
a
thing
does
belong
to
you
because
you
saved
its
life
or
given
it
life
it
only
belongs
to
you
because
you
love
it
i
know
you
belong
to
me
but
you
only
know
if
i
belong
to
you
that
not
true
now
you
do
know
and
i
know
yes
and
we
know
that
as
that
belonging
has
nothing
to
do
with
death
it
ca
have
anything
either
to
do
with
the
saving
or
even
the
giving
of
life
so
you
must
never
thank
me
or
i
you
there
are
no
thanks
in
love
and
that
was
why
i
could
bear
your
asking
me
to
marry
you
i
thought
you
were
thanking
me
when
you
played
with
the
seagull
yes
how
you
loved
it
yes
i
looked
to
see
how
you
felt
when
you
loved
a
thing
i
wanted
so
much
to
be
the
seagull
in
your
hands
when
i
touched
it
i
was
touching
you
she
put
his
hand
to
her
breast
and
whispered
i
love
birds
he
smiled
i
knew
you
loved
them
and
best
free
all
birds
must
fly
in
their
own
air
yes
she
said
but
their
freedom
only
means
their
power
to
choose
what
air
they
fly
in
and
every
choice
is
a
cage
too
i
shall
leave
the
door
open
child
i
shall
never
fly
out
said
helen
you
talked
of
going
away
yes
but
not
from
you
am
i
to
go
with
you
always
following
chance
and
making
no
plans
will
you
you
are
the
only
plan
i
ever
made
will
you
leave
everything
else
but
me
to
chance
perhaps
it
will
lead
us
all
over
the
earth
and
perhaps
after
all
we
shall
not
go
very
far
but
i
never
could
see
ahead
except
one
thing
what
was
it
the
and
you
in
your
old
blue
gown
and
for
seven
days
stopped
seeing
that
i
have
it
to
steer
by
will
you
chance
it
must
you
be
playing
with
meanings
even
in
dreams
do
you
know
do
you
know
that
for
a
woman
who
loves
and
is
not
sure
that
she
is
loved
her
days
and
nights
are
all
chances
every
minute
she
lives
is
a
chance
it
might
be
it
might
not
be
oh
those
ghosts
of
joy
and
pain
they
are
almost
too
much
to
bear
for
the
joy
is
pure
joy
or
the
pain
pure
pain
and
she
can
not
come
to
rest
in
either
of
them
sometimes
the
joy
is
nearly
as
great
as
though
she
knew
yet
at
the
instant
she
tries
to
take
it
it
looks
at
her
with
the
eyes
of
doubt
and
she
trembles
and
dare
not
take
it
yet
and
sometimes
the
pain
is
all
but
the
death
she
foresees
yet
even
as
she
submits
to
it
it
lays
upon
her
heart
the
finger
of
hope
and
then
she
trembles
again
because
she
need
not
take
it
yet
those
are
her
chances
peter
but
when
she
knows
that
her
beloved
is
her
lover
life
may
do
what
it
will
with
her
but
she
is
beyond
its
chances
for
ever
your
corn
you
kept
my
corn
till
it
should
bear
and
your
shell
there
you
kept
my
shell
till
it
should
speak
and
now
oh
see
these
things
that
have
held
our
dreams
for
twenty
years
the
life
is
threshed
from
them
for
ever
they
are
only
husks
they
can
hold
our
dreams
no
more
oh
i
ca
go
on
dreaming
by
myself
i
ca
it
no
use
i
thought
my
heart
had
learned
to
bear
its
dream
alone
but
the
time
comes
when
love
in
its
beauty
is
too
near
to
pain
there
is
more
love
than
the
single
heart
can
bear
my
boy
helen
do
suffer
so
oh
child
what
are
you
doing
letting
my
dear
dreams
go
it
no
use
peter
the
millstones
took
them
and
crushed
them
she
uttered
a
sharp
cry
his
arm
tightened
round
her
what
is
it
child
she
heard
him
say
she
looked
at
him
bewildered
and
saw
that
he
too
was
dazed
she
looked
into
the
eyes
of
a
boy
of
twenty
she
said
in
a
voice
of
wonder
oh
my
boy
as
he
felt
her
soft
hair
such
a
fuss
about
an
empty
shell
and
a
bit
of
dead
wheat
she
hid
her
face
on
his
jersey
you
are
a
silly
are
you
said
peter
i
wish
you
look
up
helen
looked
up
and
they
kissed
each
other
for
the
first
time
i
defy
you
now
mistress
jennifer
to
prove
that
your
grassblade
is
greener
than
mine
third
interlude
the
girls
now
turned
their
attention
to
their
neglected
apples
varying
this
more
serious
business
with
comments
on
the
story
that
had
just
been
related
jessica
i
should
be
glad
to
know
jane
what
you
make
of
this
matter
jane
indeed
jessica
it
is
difficult
to
make
anything
at
all
of
matter
so
bewildering
for
who
could
have
divined
reality
to
be
the
illusion
and
dreams
the
truth
so
that
by
the
light
of
their
dreams
the
lovers
in
this
tale
mistook
each
other
for
that
which
they
were
not
martin
who
indeed
mistress
jane
save
students
of
human
nature
like
yourselves
who
have
doubtless
long
ago
observed
how
men
and
women
begin
by
filling
a
dim
dream
with
a
golden
thing
such
as
youth
and
end
by
putting
a
shining
dream
into
a
gray
thing
such
as
age
and
in
the
end
it
is
all
one
and
lovers
will
see
to
the
last
in
each
other
that
which
they
loved
at
the
first
since
things
are
only
what
we
dream
them
to
be
as
you
have
of
course
also
observed
joscelyn
we
have
observed
nothing
of
the
sort
and
if
we
dreamed
at
all
we
would
dream
of
things
exactly
as
they
are
and
never
dream
of
mistaking
age
for
youth
but
we
do
not
dream
women
are
not
given
to
dreams
martin
they
are
the
fortunate
sex
men
are
such
incurable
dreamers
that
they
even
dream
women
to
be
worse
preys
of
the
delusive
habit
than
themselves
but
i
trust
you
found
my
story
sufficiently
to
keep
you
so
joscelyn
it
did
not
make
me
yawn
is
this
mill
still
to
be
found
on
the
sidlesham
marshes
martin
it
is
where
it
was
but
what
sort
of
gold
it
grinds
now
whether
corn
or
dreams
or
nothing
i
can
not
say
yet
such
is
the
power
of
what
has
been
that
i
think
were
the
stones
set
in
motion
any
right
listener
might
hear
what
helen
and
peter
once
heard
and
even
more
for
they
would
hear
the
tale
of
those
lovers
journeys
over
the
changing
waters
and
their
return
time
and
again
to
the
unchanging
plot
of
earth
that
kept
their
secrets
until
in
the
end
they
were
together
delivered
up
to
the
millstones
which
thresh
the
immortal
grain
from
its
mortal
husk
but
this
was
after
long
years
of
gladness
and
a
life
kept
young
by
the
child
which
each
was
always
in
the
other
heart
jennifer
oh
i
am
glad
they
were
glad
do
you
know
i
had
begun
to
think
they
would
not
be
jessica
it
was
exactly
so
with
me
for
suppose
peter
had
never
returned
or
when
he
did
she
had
found
him
dead
in
the
tree
jane
and
even
after
he
returned
and
recovered
how
nearly
they
were
removed
from
ever
understanding
each
other
joan
oh
no
jane
once
they
came
together
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
the
understanding
as
soon
as
peter
came
back
i
felt
sure
it
would
be
all
right
joyce
and
i
too
all
along
was
convinced
the
tale
must
end
happily
martin
strange
so
was
i
for
love
in
his
daily
labors
is
as
swift
in
averting
the
nature
of
perils
as
he
is
deft
in
diverting
the
causes
of
misunderstanding
i
know
in
fact
of
but
one
thing
that
would
have
foiled
him
four
of
the
milkmaids
what
then
martin
had
helen
not
been
given
to
dreams
not
a
word
was
said
in
the
joscelyn
it
would
have
done
her
no
harm
had
she
not
been
singer
nor
would
your
story
have
suffered
being
like
all
stories
a
thing
as
important
as
thistledown
in
either
event
though
peter
had
perished
or
misunderstood
her
for
ever
it
would
not
have
concerned
me
a
whit
or
even
in
both
events
jessica
nor
me
jane
nor
me
martin
then
farewell
my
story
a
thing
as
important
as
thistledown
is
as
unimportantly
dismissed
and
yonder
in
heaven
the
moon
sulks
at
us
through
a
cloud
with
a
quarter
of
her
eye
reproaching
us
for
our
chatter
it
destroys
our
own
no
less
than
hers
to
dream
is
forbidden
but
at
least
let
us
sleep
one
by
one
the
milkmaids
settled
in
the
grass
and
covered
their
faces
with
their
hands
and
went
to
sleep
but
jennifer
remained
where
she
was
she
sat
with
downcast
eyes
softly
drawing
the
grassblade
through
and
through
her
fingers
and
the
swing
swayed
a
little
like
a
branch
moving
in
an
imperceptible
wind
and
her
breast
heaved
a
little
as
though
stirred
with
inaudible
sighs
she
sat
so
long
like
that
that
martin
knew
she
had
forgotten
he
was
beside
her
and
he
quietly
put
out
his
hand
to
draw
the
grassblade
from
hers
but
before
he
had
even
touched
it
he
felt
something
fall
upon
his
palm
that
was
not
rain
or
dew
dear
mistress
jennifer
said
martin
gently
why
do
you
weep
she
shook
her
head
since
there
are
times
when
the
voice
plays
a
girl
false
and
will
not
serve
her
is
it
said
martin
because
the
grass
is
not
green
enough
she
nodded
pray
let
me
judge
entreated
martin
and
took
the
grassblade
from
her
fingers
whereupon
she
put
her
face
into
her
two
hands
whispering
master
pippin
master
pippin
oh
master
pippin
let
me
judge
said
martin
again
but
in
a
whisper
too
then
jennifer
took
her
hands
from
her
wet
face
and
looked
at
him
with
her
wet
eyes
and
said
with
great
braveness
and
much
faltering
i
will
be
nineteen
in
november
at
this
martin
looked
very
grave
and
he
got
down
from
the
tree
and
walked
to
the
end
of
the
orchard
full
of
thought
but
when
he
turned
there
he
found
that
she
had
stolen
after
him
and
was
standing
near
him
hanging
her
head
yet
watching
him
with
deep
anxiety
jennifer
it
is
old
is
it
martin
too
old
for
what
jennifer
i
i
i
do
know
martin
it
is
of
course
extremely
old
there
are
things
you
will
never
be
able
to
do
again
because
you
are
so
old
jennifer
sobbed
martin
you
are
too
old
to
be
rocked
in
a
cradle
you
are
too
old
to
write
pothooks
and
hangers
and
too
old
alas
to
steal
pickles
and
jam
when
the
house
is
abed
yet
there
are
still
a
few
things
you
might
do
if
jennifer
oh
if
martin
if
you
could
find
a
friend
as
old
as
yourself
or
even
a
little
older
to
help
you
jennifer
but
think
how
old
h
h
h
the
friend
would
have
to
be
martin
what
would
that
matter
for
all
grass
is
green
enough
if
it
not
near
grass
that
looks
greener
jennifer
oh
is
this
true
martin
it
is
indeed
and
i
believe
too
that
were
your
friend
hair
red
enough
and
your
friend
freckled
nose
snub
enough
since
youth
resides
long
in
these
qualities
you
might
even
with
such
a
companion
begin
once
more
to
steal
pickles
and
jam
by
night
to
learn
your
pothooks
and
hangers
and
even
in
time
to
be
rocked
asleep
by
a
cradle
jennifer
master
pippin
martin
they
look
quite
green
do
they
and
he
laid
the
two
blades
side
by
side
on
her
palm
and
jennifer
whose
voice
once
more
would
not
serve
her
nodded
and
put
the
two
blades
in
her
pocket
then
martin
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
very
carefully
dried
her
eyes
and
cheeks
saying
as
he
did
so
now
that
i
have
explained
this
to
your
satisfaction
wo
you
please
explain
something
to
mine
jennifer
i
will
if
i
can
martin
then
explain
what
it
is
you
have
against
men
jennifer
i
do
know
how
to
tell
you
it
is
so
terrible
martin
i
will
try
to
bear
it
jennifer
they
say
women
can
not
can
not
martin
can
not
jennifer
keep
secrets
martin
men
say
so
jennifer
yes
martin
men
say
so
jennifer
they
do
they
do
martin
men
oh
jupiter
if
this
were
true
but
it
is
not
these
men
would
be
blabbing
the
greatest
of
secrets
in
saying
so
if
i
had
a
secret
but
i
have
not
do
you
think
i
would
trust
it
to
a
man
not
i
what
does
a
man
do
with
a
secret
forgets
it
throws
it
behind
him
into
some
empty
chamber
of
his
brain
and
lets
the
cobwebs
smother
it
buries
it
in
some
deserted
corner
of
his
heart
and
lets
the
weeds
grow
over
it
is
this
keeping
a
secret
would
you
keep
a
garden
or
a
baby
so
i
will
a
thousand
times
sooner
give
my
secret
to
a
woman
she
will
tend
it
and
cherish
it
laugh
and
cry
with
it
dress
it
in
a
new
dress
every
day
and
dandle
it
in
the
world
eye
for
joy
and
pride
in
it
nay
she
will
bid
the
whole
world
come
into
her
nursery
to
admire
the
pretty
secret
she
keeps
so
well
and
under
her
charge
a
little
secret
will
grow
into
a
big
one
with
a
hundred
charms
and
additions
it
had
not
when
i
confided
it
to
her
so
that
i
shall
hardly
know
it
again
when
i
ask
for
it
so
beautiful
so
important
so
mysterious
will
it
have
become
in
the
woman
care
oh
believe
me
mistress
jennifer
it
is
women
who
keep
secrets
and
men
who
neglect
them
jennifer
if
i
had
only
thought
of
these
things
to
say
but
i
am
not
clever
at
argument
like
men
martin
i
suspect
these
clever
arguers
they
can
always
find
the
right
thing
to
say
even
if
they
are
in
the
wrong
women
are
not
to
be
blamed
for
washing
their
hands
of
them
for
ever
jennifer
i
know
yet
i
can
not
help
wondering
who
bakes
them
gingerbread
for
sunday
martin
let
them
go
without
they
do
not
deserve
gingerbread
jennifer
i
know
i
know
but
they
like
it
so
much
and
it
is
nice
making
it
too
martin
then
i
suppose
it
will
have
to
be
made
till
the
last
of
sundays
what
a
bother
it
all
is
jennifer
i
know
good
night
dear
master
pippin
martin
dear
milkmaid
good
night
there
lie
your
fellows
careless
of
the
color
of
the
grass
they
lie
on
and
of
the
years
that
lie
on
them
they
have
forsworn
the
baking
of
cakes
the
eating
of
which
begets
dreams
to
which
women
are
not
given
go
lie
with
them
and
be
if
you
can
as
careless
and
dreamless
as
they
are
and
then
seeing
the
tears
refilling
her
eyes
he
hastily
pulled
out
his
handkerchief
again
and
wiped
them
as
they
fell
saying
but
if
you
can
not
if
you
can
not
do
cry
so
fast
if
you
can
not
then
give
me
your
key
dear
jennifer
please
dry
up
to
gillian
because
you
were
glad
that
my
tale
ended
gladly
and
also
because
all
lovers
no
matter
of
what
age
are
green
enough
and
chiefly
because
my
handkerchief
sopping
then
jennifer
caught
his
hands
in
hers
and
whispered
oh
martin
are
they
all
lovers
are
they
green
enough
god
help
them
yes
said
martin
pippin
she
dropped
his
hands
leaving
her
key
in
them
and
looked
up
at
him
with
wet
lashes
but
happiness
behind
them
so
he
stooped
and
kissed
the
last
tears
from
her
eyes
since
his
handkerchief
had
become
quite
useless
for
the
purpose
and
she
stole
back
to
her
place
and
he
lay
down
in
his
and
jennifer
dreamed
that
she
was
baking
gingerbread
and
martin
that
he
was
eating
it
maids
maids
maids
it
was
old
gillman
on
the
heels
of
dawn
a
pest
on
him
and
all
farmers
groaned
martin
who
would
harvest
men
slumbers
as
soon
as
they
sown
get
into
hiding
commanded
joscelyn
i
will
not
budge
said
martin
i
am
going
to
sleep
again
for
at
that
moment
i
had
a
lion
in
one
hand
and
a
unicorn
in
the
other
will
you
conceal
yourself
whispered
joscelyn
with
as
much
fury
as
a
whisper
can
compass
and
the
lion
had
comfits
in
his
crown
and
the
unicorn
a
gilded
horn
and
both
were
so
sticky
and
spicy
and
sweet
joscelyn
flung
herself
upon
her
knees
before
him
spreading
her
yellow
skirts
which
barely
concealed
him
as
old
gillman
thrust
his
head
through
the
hawthorn
gap
good
morrow
maids
he
that
i
knew
not
dear
mistress
joscelyn
murmured
martin
which
to
bite
first
good
morrow
master
cried
the
milkmaids
loudly
and
they
fluttered
their
petticoats
like
sunshine
between
the
man
at
the
hedge
and
the
man
in
the
grass
is
my
daughter
any
merrier
this
morning
no
master
said
jennifer
yet
i
think
i
see
smiles
on
their
way
if
they
lag
much
longer
muttered
the
farmer
they
be
on
the
wrong
side
of
her
mouth
when
they
do
come
for
what
sort
of
a
home
will
she
return
to
a
pothouse
and
what
sort
of
a
father
a
drunkard
and
the
fault
hers
that
deprives
him
of
the
drink
he
loved
in
his
sober
days
gillian
he
exclaimed
when
will
ye
give
up
this
child
whim
to
learn
by
experience
and
take
an
old
man
word
for
it
but
gillian
was
as
deaf
to
him
as
to
the
cock
crowing
in
the
barnyard
come
fetch
your
portion
said
old
gillman
to
the
milkmaids
since
there
no
help
for
it
and
good
day
to
ye
and
a
better
morrow
wait
a
bit
master
entreated
jennifer
and
tell
me
if
daisy
my
lincoln
red
lacks
for
anything
for
nothing
that
tom
can
help
her
to
maid
but
she
lacks
you
and
lacking
you
her
milk
so
that
being
a
cow
she
may
be
said
to
lack
everything
and
so
do
i
and
the
men
and
the
farm
ruin
our
portion
nothing
but
rack
and
ruin
saying
which
he
departed
to
breakfast
said
martin
cheerfully
suppose
you
been
seen
scolded
joscelyn
then
our
tales
would
have
been
at
an
end
said
martin
would
this
have
distressed
you
the
sooner
they
ended
the
better
said
joscelyn
if
you
can
do
nothing
but
babble
of
sticky
unicorns
it
was
fresh
from
the
oven
explained
martin
meekly
i
wish
we
could
have
gingerbread
for
breakfast
instead
of
bread
do
not
be
sure
said
joscelyn
severely
that
you
will
get
even
bread
i
am
in
your
hands
said
martin
but
please
be
kinder
to
the
ducks
joscelyn
all
of
a
fluster
then
put
new
bread
in
the
place
of
gillian
old
but
her
annoyance
was
turned
to
pleasure
when
she
discovered
that
the
little
round
top
of
yesterday
loaf
had
entirely
disappeared
upon
my
word
cried
she
the
cure
is
taking
effect
i
believe
you
are
right
said
martin
how
sorry
the
ducks
will
be
they
quickly
fed
the
ducks
and
then
themselves
and
martin
received
his
usual
share
joscelyn
having
so
far
relented
that
she
even
advised
him
as
to
the
best
tree
for
apples
in
the
whole
orchard
after
breakfast
martin
found
six
pair
of
eyes
fixed
so
earnestly
upon
him
that
he
began
to
laugh
why
do
you
laugh
asked
little
joan
because
of
my
thoughts
said
he
so
she
took
a
new
penny
from
her
pocket
and
gave
it
to
him
i
was
thinking
said
martin
how
strange
it
is
that
girls
are
all
so
exactly
alike
oh
cried
six
different
voices
in
a
single
key
of
indignation
what
a
fib
said
joyce
i
am
like
nobody
but
me
nor
am
cried
all
the
others
in
a
breath
yet
a
moment
ago
said
martin
you
mistress
joyce
were
wondering
with
all
your
might
what
diversion
i
had
hit
upon
for
this
morning
and
so
were
jane
and
jessica
and
jennifer
and
joan
and
joscelyn
i
was
not
cried
six
voices
at
once
what
none
of
you
said
martin
did
i
not
say
so
and
they
were
very
provoked
not
knowing
what
to
answer
for
fear
it
might
be
on
the
tip
of
her
neighbor
tongue
so
they
said
nothing
at
all
and
with
one
accord
tossed
their
heads
and
turned
their
backs
on
him
and
martin
laughed
leaving
them
to
guess
why
on
which
greatly
put
out
every
girl
without
even
consulting
one
another
they
decided
to
have
nothing
further
to
do
with
him
and
each
girl
went
and
sat
under
a
different
and
began
to
do
her
hair
heigho
said
martin
then
this
morning
i
must
divert
myself
and
he
began
to
spin
his
golden
penny
in
the
sun
sometimes
spinning
it
very
dexterously
from
his
elbow
and
never
letting
it
fall
but
the
girls
would
look
or
if
they
did
it
was
through
stray
bits
of
their
hair
when
they
could
not
be
suspected
of
looking
i
shall
certainly
lose
this
penny
communed
martin
with
himself
quite
audibly
if
somebody
does
not
lend
me
a
purse
to
keep
it
in
but
nobody
offered
him
one
so
he
plucked
a
blade
of
shepherd
purse
from
the
grass
soliloquizing
now
had
i
been
a
shepherd
or
had
the
shepherd
name
been
martin
here
was
my
purse
to
my
hand
and
then
having
saved
my
riches
i
might
have
got
married
yet
i
never
was
a
shepherd
nor
ever
knew
a
shepherd
of
my
name
and
a
penny
is
in
any
case
a
great
deal
too
much
money
for
a
man
to
marry
on
be
he
a
shepherd
or
no
for
it
is
always
best
to
marry
on
from
which
a
penny
is
three
times
removed
then
he
went
on
spinning
his
penny
in
the
air
again
humming
to
himself
a
song
of
no
value
which
so
far
as
the
girls
could
tell
for
the
hair
over
their
ears
went
as
follows
if
i
should
be
so
lucky
as
a
farthing
for
to
find
i
would
spend
the
farthing
according
to
my
mind
but
i
beat
it
and
i
bend
it
and
i
break
it
into
two
and
give
one
half
to
a
shepherd
and
the
other
half
to
you
and
as
for
both
your
fortunes
i
wish
you
nothing
worse
than
that
your
half
and
his
half
should
lie
in
the
shepherd
purse
at
the
end
of
the
song
he
spun
the
penny
so
high
that
it
fell
into
the
and
endeavoring
to
catch
it
he
flung
the
spire
of
after
it
and
so
lost
both
and
nobody
took
the
least
notice
of
his
song
or
his
loss
then
martin
said
who
cares
and
took
a
new
clay
pipe
and
a
little
packet
from
his
pocket
and
he
wandered
about
the
orchard
till
he
had
found
an
old
tin
pannikin
and
he
scooped
up
some
water
from
the
duckpond
and
made
a
lather
in
it
with
the
soap
in
the
packet
and
sat
on
the
gate
and
blew
bubbles
the
first
bubble
in
the
pipe
was
always
crystal
and
sometimes
had
a
jewel
hanging
from
it
which
made
it
fall
to
the
earth
and
the
second
was
tinged
with
color
and
the
third
gleamed
like
sunset
or
like
peacocks
wings
or
rainbows
or
opals
all
the
colors
of
earth
and
heaven
chased
each
other
on
their
surfaces
in
all
the
swift
and
changing
shapes
that
tobacco
smoke
plays
at
on
the
air
but
of
all
their
colors
they
take
the
deepest
glow
of
one
or
two
and
now
martin
would
blow
a
world
of
flame
and
orange
through
the
trees
or
one
of
blue
and
gold
or
another
of
green
and
rose
and
as
he
might
have
watched
his
dreams
he
watched
the
bubbles
float
away
and
break
but
one
of
the
loveliest
at
last
sailed
over
the
and
between
the
ropes
of
the
swing
and
among
the
boughs
miraculously
escaping
all
perils
and
over
the
hedge
where
a
small
wind
bore
it
up
and
up
out
of
sight
and
martin
who
had
been
looking
after
it
with
a
rapt
gaze
sighed
oh
and
six
other
ohs
echoed
his
then
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
six
milkmaids
standing
quite
close
to
him
full
of
hesitation
and
longing
so
he
took
six
more
pipes
from
his
pockets
and
soon
the
air
was
glistening
with
bubbles
big
and
little
sometimes
they
blew
the
bubbles
very
quickly
shaking
the
tiny
globes
as
fast
as
they
could
from
the
bowl
till
the
air
was
filled
with
a
treasure
of
opals
and
diamonds
and
moonstones
and
pearls
as
though
the
king
of
the
east
had
emptied
his
casket
there
and
sometimes
they
blew
steadily
and
with
care
endeavoring
to
create
the
best
and
biggest
bubble
of
all
but
generally
they
blew
an
instant
too
long
and
the
bubble
burst
before
it
left
the
pipe
whenever
a
great
sphere
was
launched
the
blower
cried
in
ecstasy
oh
look
at
mine
and
her
comrades
merely
glancing
cried
in
equal
ecstasy
yes
but
see
mine
and
each
had
a
moment
delight
in
the
others
bubbles
but
everlasting
joy
in
her
own
and
was
secretly
certain
that
of
all
the
bubbles
hers
were
the
biggest
and
brightest
the
biggest
and
brightest
of
all
was
really
blown
by
little
joan
as
martin
in
a
whisper
assured
her
he
whispered
the
same
thing
however
to
each
of
her
friends
and
for
one
truth
told
five
lies
sometimes
they
played
together
taking
their
bubbles
delicately
from
one
pipe
to
another
and
sometimes
blew
their
bubbles
side
by
side
till
they
united
and
made
their
venture
into
the
world
like
man
and
wife
and
often
they
put
all
their
pipes
at
once
into
the
pannikin
and
blew
in
the
water
rearing
a
great
palace
of
crystal
hemispheres
that
rose
until
it
hit
their
chins
and
cheeks
and
the
tips
of
their
noses
and
broke
on
them
leaving
on
their
fair
skin
a
trace
of
glistening
foam
and
as
the
six
laughing
faces
bent
over
the
pannikin
on
his
knees
martin
observed
that
joscelyn
hair
was
coiled
like
two
great
lovely
roses
over
her
ears
and
that
joyce
was
in
clusters
of
ringlets
and
that
jane
was
folded
close
and
smooth
and
shining
round
her
small
head
and
that
jessica
was
tucked
under
like
a
boy
while
jennifer
lay
in
a
soft
knot
on
her
neck
but
little
joan
was
hanging
still
in
its
plaits
over
her
shoulders
and
one
thick
plait
was
half
undone
and
the
loose
hair
got
in
her
own
and
everybody
way
and
was
such
a
nuisance
that
martin
was
obliged
at
last
to
gather
it
in
his
hand
and
hold
it
aside
for
the
sake
of
the
and
when
they
lifted
their
heads
he
was
looking
at
them
so
gravely
that
joyce
laughed
and
jessica
eyes
were
a
question
and
jane
looked
demure
and
jennifer
astonished
and
joscelyn
extremely
composed
and
indifferent
and
little
joan
blushed
to
cover
her
blushing
she
offered
him
another
penny
i
was
thinking
said
martin
how
strange
it
is
that
girls
are
so
absolutely
different
then
six
demure
shadows
appeared
at
the
very
corners
of
their
mouths
and
they
rose
from
their
knees
and
said
with
one
accord
it
must
be
and
it
was
bread
is
a
good
thing
said
martin
twirling
a
buttercup
as
he
swallowed
his
last
crumb
but
i
also
like
butter
do
not
you
mistress
joscelyn
it
depends
on
who
makes
it
said
she
there
is
butter
and
butter
i
believe
said
martin
that
you
do
not
like
butter
at
all
i
do
not
like
other
people
butter
said
joscelyn
let
us
be
sure
said
martin
and
he
twirled
his
buttercup
under
her
chin
fie
mistress
joscelyn
he
cried
what
a
golden
chin
i
never
saw
any
one
so
fond
of
butter
in
all
my
days
is
it
very
gold
asked
joscelyn
and
ran
to
the
duckpond
to
look
but
could
see
because
she
was
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
gate
do
i
like
butter
cried
jessica
do
i
cried
jennifer
do
i
cried
joyce
do
i
cried
jane
oh
do
i
cried
joan
we
soon
find
out
said
martin
and
put
buttercups
under
all
their
chins
turn
by
turn
and
they
all
liked
butter
exceedingly
do
you
like
butter
master
pippin
asked
little
joan
try
me
said
he
and
six
buttercups
were
simultaneously
presented
to
his
chin
and
it
was
discovered
that
he
liked
butter
the
best
of
them
all
then
every
girl
had
to
prove
it
on
every
other
girl
and
again
on
martin
one
at
a
time
and
he
on
them
again
and
in
this
delicious
pastime
the
afternoon
wore
by
and
evening
fell
and
they
came
to
dinner
supper
was
scarcely
ended
indeed
her
mouth
was
still
full
when
jessica
looking
straight
at
martin
said
i
dying
to
swing
i
never
saved
a
lady
life
easier
said
martin
and
in
one
moment
she
found
herself
where
she
wished
to
be
and
in
the
next
saw
him
close
beside
her
on
the
the
five
other
girls
went
to
their
own
branches
as
naturally
as
hens
to
the
roost
joscelyn
inspected
them
like
a
captain
marshalling
his
men
and
when
each
was
armed
with
an
apple
she
said
we
are
ready
now
master
pippin
i
wish
i
were
too
said
he
but
my
tale
has
taken
a
fit
of
the
shivers
on
the
threshold
like
an
unexpected
guest
who
doubts
his
welcome
are
we
not
all
bidding
it
in
said
joscelyn
impatiently
yes
like
sweet
daughters
of
the
house
said
martin
but
what
of
the
mistress
and
he
looked
across
at
gillian
by
the
well
but
she
looked
only
into
the
grass
and
her
thoughts
let
the
daughters
do
to
begin
with
said
joscelyn
and
make
it
your
business
to
stay
till
the
mistress
shall
appear
that
might
be
to
outstay
my
welcome
said
martin
and
then
her
appearance
would
be
my
discomfiture
for
a
hostess
has
according
to
her
guests
as
many
kinds
of
face
as
a
wildflower
according
to
its
counties
names
some
kinds
have
only
one
name
said
jessica
plucking
a
stalk
crowned
with
flowers
as
fine
as
spray
what
would
you
call
this
but
cow
parsley
if
i
were
in
anglia
said
martin
i
would
call
it
queen
lace
that
a
pretty
name
said
jessica
pretty
enough
to
sing
about
said
martin
and
looking
carelessly
at
the
he
thrummed
his
lute
and
sang
the
queen
netted
lace
on
the
first
april
day
the
queen
wore
her
lace
in
the
first
week
of
may
the
queen
soiled
her
lace
ere
may
was
out
again
so
the
queen
washed
her
lace
in
the
first
june
rain
the
queen
bleached
her
lace
on
the
first
of
july
she
spread
it
in
the
orchard
and
left
it
there
to
dry
but
on
the
first
of
august
it
was
in
its
place
because
my
sweetheart
picked
it
up
and
hung
it
her
face
she
laughed
at
me
she
blushed
at
me
with
such
a
pretty
grace
that
i
kissed
her
in
september
through
the
queen
own
lace
at
the
end
of
the
song
gillian
sat
up
in
the
grass
and
looked
with
all
her
heart
over
the
duckpond
joscelyn
i
find
your
songs
singularly
lacking
in
point
singer
martin
you
surprise
me
mistress
joscelyn
the
kiss
was
the
point
joscelyn
it
is
like
you
to
think
so
it
is
just
like
you
to
think
a
a
a
martin
kiss
joscelyn
sufficient
conclusion
to
any
circumstances
martin
is
it
joscelyn
my
goodness
you
might
as
soon
ask
is
a
peardrop
sufficient
for
a
body
dinner
martin
it
would
suffice
me
i
love
peardrops
but
then
i
am
a
man
women
doubtless
need
more
substance
being
in
themselves
more
insubstantial
now
as
to
your
quarrel
with
my
song
joscelyn
it
is
of
no
consequence
you
raise
expectations
which
you
do
not
fulfill
but
it
is
not
of
the
least
consequence
martin
dear
mistress
joscelyn
my
only
desire
is
to
please
you
we
will
not
conclude
on
a
kiss
you
shall
fulfill
your
own
expectations
joscelyn
mine
i
have
no
expectations
whatever
martin
but
i
have
disappointed
you
what
shall
i
do
with
my
sweetheart
shall
she
be
whipped
for
her
theft
shall
she
be
shut
in
a
dungeon
shall
she
be
thrown
before
elephants
choose
your
conclusion
joan
but
master
pippin
why
must
the
poor
sweetheart
be
punished
i
am
sure
joscelyn
never
wished
her
to
be
punished
there
are
other
conclusions
martin
dunderhead
that
i
am
i
ca
think
of
any
what
mistress
joscelyn
was
the
conclusion
you
expected
joscelyn
i
tell
you
i
expected
none
joan
why
master
pippin
i
should
have
fancied
that
seeing
the
dear
sweetheart
had
hung
the
veil
over
her
face
she
might
martin
yes
joan
be
expected
martin
yes
joan
to
be
about
to
be
joscelyn
i
am
sick
to
death
of
this
silly
sweetheart
and
since
our
mistress
appears
to
be
listening
with
both
her
ears
it
would
be
more
to
the
point
to
begin
whatever
story
you
propose
to
relate
and
be
done
with
it
martin
you
are
always
right
therefore
add
your
ears
to
hers
while
i
tell
you
the
tale
of
open
winkins
open
winkins
there
were
once
dear
maidens
five
lords
in
the
east
of
sussex
who
owned
between
them
a
single
burgh
for
they
were
brothers
their
names
were
lionel
and
hugh
and
heriot
and
ambrose
and
hobb
lionel
was
ten
years
of
age
and
hobb
was
there
being
exactly
three
years
all
but
a
month
between
the
birthdays
of
the
brothers
and
lionel
had
a
merry
spirit
and
hugh
great
courage
and
daring
and
heriot
had
beauty
past
any
man
share
and
ambrose
had
a
wise
mind
but
hobb
had
nothing
at
all
for
the
world
praise
for
he
only
had
a
loving
heart
which
he
spent
upon
his
brothers
and
his
garden
and
since
love
begets
love
they
all
loved
him
dearly
and
leaned
heavily
on
his
affection
though
neither
they
nor
any
man
looked
up
to
him
because
he
was
a
lord
although
he
was
the
eldest
and
in
his
quiet
way
administered
the
affairs
of
the
burgh
and
of
the
people
of
alfriston
under
the
burgh
it
was
ambrose
who
was
always
thinking
of
new
schemes
for
improvement
and
heriot
who
undertook
the
festivities
as
for
the
younger
boys
they
kept
the
old
place
alive
with
their
youth
and
spirits
and
it
was
evident
that
later
on
hugh
would
win
honor
to
the
burgh
in
battle
and
adventure
and
lionel
would
draw
the
world
thither
with
his
charm
but
hobb
to
whom
they
all
brought
their
shapeless
dreams
since
sympathy
helps
us
to
create
bodies
for
the
things
which
begin
their
existence
as
souls
hobb
differed
from
the
four
others
not
only
in
his
name
but
in
his
plain
appearance
and
simple
tastes
and
all
these
things
as
well
as
his
tender
heart
he
got
from
his
mother
who
was
the
only
daughter
of
a
gardener
of
alfriston
the
gardener
to
whom
she
was
the
very
apple
of
his
eye
had
kept
her
privately
in
a
place
on
a
hill
fearing
lest
in
her
youth
and
inexperience
she
should
fall
to
the
lot
of
some
man
not
worthy
of
her
for
her
knew
or
believed
that
a
young
girl
of
her
sweetness
and
tenderness
and
devotedness
of
disposition
would
by
her
sweetness
attract
a
lover
too
early
and
by
her
tenderness
respond
to
him
too
readily
and
by
her
devotedness
follow
him
too
blindly
before
she
had
time
to
know
herself
or
men
and
he
also
knew
or
believed
that
first
love
is
as
often
a
as
the
star
for
which
all
young
things
take
it
five
days
in
the
week
he
tended
the
gardens
of
alfriston
the
sixth
he
gave
to
the
lord
of
the
burgh
that
lay
among
the
hills
and
the
seventh
he
kept
for
his
daughter
on
the
hill
a
few
miles
distant
which
was
afterwards
known
as
hobb
hawth
she
on
her
part
spent
her
week
in
endeavoring
to
grow
a
perfect
rose
of
a
certain
golden
species
and
her
heart
was
given
wholly
to
her
father
and
her
flower
and
he
watched
her
efforts
with
interest
and
advice
and
for
the
first
she
thanked
him
but
of
the
second
took
no
heed
for
said
she
this
is
my
garden
father
and
my
rose
and
i
will
grow
it
in
my
own
way
or
not
at
all
have
you
not
had
a
lifetime
of
gardens
and
roses
which
you
have
brought
to
perfection
and
would
you
let
any
man
take
your
own
upon
his
shoulders
even
your
own
mistakes
and
shoulder
at
last
the
praise
after
the
blame
then
hobb
her
father
laughed
at
her
indulgently
and
said
nay
not
any
man
yet
once
i
let
a
woman
and
without
her
aid
i
would
never
have
brought
my
rarest
and
dearest
flower
to
perfection
so
if
i
should
let
a
woman
help
me
why
not
you
a
man
was
the
woman
your
mother
said
she
and
her
father
was
silent
then
a
day
came
when
he
trudged
up
and
down
the
hills
from
alfriston
and
standing
at
the
gate
of
her
garden
saw
his
child
in
the
arms
of
a
stranger
and
her
face
as
it
lay
against
his
heart
seemed
to
her
father
also
to
be
the
face
of
a
stranger
and
not
of
his
child
he
recognized
in
the
stranger
the
lord
of
the
burgh
and
he
saw
that
what
he
had
feared
had
come
to
pass
and
that
his
daughter
heart
would
be
no
more
divided
between
her
father
and
her
flower
for
it
was
given
whole
to
the
lover
who
had
first
assailed
it
hobb
came
into
the
garden
and
they
looked
up
as
the
gate
clicked
and
their
faces
grew
as
red
as
though
one
had
caught
the
reflection
from
the
other
but
both
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
and
his
daughter
pointing
to
her
bush
said
father
my
rose
is
grown
at
last
and
he
saw
that
the
bush
was
crowned
with
a
glorious
golden
bloom
perfect
in
every
detail
then
it
was
the
turn
of
the
lord
of
the
burgh
and
he
said
sir
i
ask
leave
to
rob
your
garden
of
its
rose
do
robbers
ask
leave
said
hobb
and
he
shook
his
head
adding
nay
when
the
thief
and
the
theft
are
in
collusion
what
say
is
left
to
the
owner
of
the
treasure
yet
i
do
not
like
this
sir
have
you
considered
that
she
is
a
gardener
child
daughter
have
you
considered
that
he
is
a
lord
and
neither
of
them
had
considered
these
questions
and
they
did
not
propose
to
do
so
then
hobb
shook
his
head
again
and
said
i
will
not
waste
words
i
know
when
a
plant
can
drink
no
more
water
and
though
you
pretend
to
ask
my
leave
i
know
that
you
are
prepared
to
dispense
with
it
but
by
way
of
consent
i
will
say
this
whatever
you
may
call
your
other
sons
you
shall
call
your
first
hobb
to
remind
you
of
what
you
will
not
consider
for
my
daughter
when
she
is
a
lord
wife
will
none
the
less
still
be
a
daughter
and
your
children
will
be
grafted
of
two
stocks
and
if
this
seems
to
you
a
hard
condition
then
kiss
and
bid
farewell
and
they
both
laughed
with
joy
at
the
lightness
of
the
condition
but
the
gardener
did
not
laugh
and
so
the
lord
of
the
burgh
married
the
gardener
daughter
and
they
called
their
first
son
hobb
he
was
born
on
a
first
of
august
and
months
later
ambrose
was
born
on
the
first
of
july
and
in
due
course
heriot
in
june
and
hugh
in
may
and
lionel
in
april
and
the
lord
loving
his
sons
equally
made
them
equal
possessors
of
the
burgh
when
in
time
it
should
pass
out
of
his
hands
which
since
men
are
mortal
presently
came
to
pass
and
there
were
five
lords
instead
of
one
it
happened
on
a
roaring
night
of
march
when
the
wind
was
blustering
over
the
barren
ocean
of
the
east
downs
and
lionel
was
still
a
boy
of
ten
but
soon
to
be
eleven
that
the
five
brothers
sat
clustered
about
the
great
hearth
in
the
hall
roasting
apples
and
talking
of
this
and
that
but
their
talk
was
fitful
and
had
long
pauses
in
which
they
listened
to
the
gusty
night
which
had
so
much
more
to
say
than
they
and
after
one
of
the
silences
lionel
shuddered
slightly
and
drawing
his
little
stool
close
to
hobb
he
said
it
sounds
like
witches
hobb
put
his
big
hand
round
the
child
head
and
face
and
lionel
pressed
his
cheek
against
his
brother
knee
or
lions
said
hugh
jumping
up
and
running
to
the
window
where
he
flattened
his
nose
to
stare
into
the
night
i
wish
it
were
lions
coming
over
the
downs
what
would
you
do
with
them
said
hobb
smiling
broadly
fight
them
said
hugh
and
chain
them
up
i
should
like
to
have
lions
instead
of
dogs
a
red
lion
and
a
white
one
i
never
heard
tell
of
lions
of
those
colors
said
hobb
but
perhaps
ambrose
has
with
all
his
reading
not
i
said
ambrose
but
i
have
read
half
the
books
yet
the
wind
still
knows
more
than
i
and
it
may
be
that
he
knows
where
red
and
white
lions
are
to
be
found
for
he
knows
everything
and
has
seen
everything
murmured
heriot
watching
a
lovely
flame
of
blue
and
green
that
flickered
among
the
red
and
gold
on
the
hearth
and
has
been
everywhere
muttered
hugh
if
i
could
find
and
catch
him
i
ask
him
for
a
red
and
a
white
lion
i
rather
have
peacocks
said
heriot
his
eyes
on
the
fire
what
would
you
choose
ambrose
asked
hobb
nothing
said
he
but
it
the
hardest
of
all
things
to
have
and
i
doubt
if
i
get
it
but
what
business
have
we
to
be
choosing
presents
that
is
lionel
right
before
ours
for
is
his
birthday
next
month
what
will
you
ask
of
the
wind
for
your
birthday
lal
then
lionel
who
was
getting
very
drowsy
smiled
a
sleepy
smile
and
said
i
like
a
farm
of
my
own
in
the
downs
a
very
little
farm
with
pink
pigs
and
black
cocks
and
white
donkeys
and
chestnut
horses
no
bigger
than
grasshoppers
and
mice
and
a
very
little
well
as
big
as
my
mug
to
draw
up
my
water
from
and
a
little
green
paddock
the
size
of
my
and
another
of
yellow
corn
and
another
of
crimson
trefoil
and
i
would
have
a
blue
no
larger
than
hobb
shoe
and
a
haystack
half
as
big
as
a
and
a
duckpond
that
i
could
cover
with
my
platter
and
i
live
there
and
play
with
it
all
day
long
if
only
i
knew
where
the
wind
lives
and
could
ask
him
how
to
get
it
do
start
till
jested
ambrose
you
too
sleepy
to
find
the
way
then
he
turned
to
his
book
and
hugh
was
still
at
the
window
and
heriot
gazing
into
the
fire
and
as
he
felt
the
child
head
droop
in
his
hand
hobb
picked
him
up
in
his
arms
and
carried
him
to
bed
and
he
alone
of
all
those
brothers
had
made
no
choice
nor
had
they
thought
to
ask
him
so
accustomed
were
they
to
see
him
jog
along
without
the
desires
that
lead
men
to
their
goals
such
as
ambrose
thirst
for
knowledge
and
heriot
passion
for
beauty
and
hugh
lust
for
adventure
and
lionel
pursuit
of
delight
and
yet
unknown
to
them
all
he
had
a
heartfelt
wish
which
among
other
things
he
had
inherited
from
his
mother
for
on
a
height
west
of
the
burgh
he
had
made
a
garden
where
like
her
he
labored
to
produce
a
perfect
golden
rose
but
so
far
luck
was
against
him
though
his
height
which
was
therefore
spoken
of
as
the
gardener
hill
bloomed
with
the
loveliest
flowers
of
all
sorts
imaginable
but
year
by
year
his
rose
was
attacked
by
a
special
pest
the
nature
of
which
he
had
not
succeeded
in
discovering
yet
his
patience
was
inexhaustible
and
his
brothers
who
sometimes
came
to
his
garden
when
they
needed
a
listener
for
their
achieved
or
unachieved
ambitions
never
suspected
that
he
too
had
an
ambition
he
had
not
realized
for
they
saw
only
a
lovely
garden
of
his
creating
where
wisdom
beauty
adventure
and
delight
were
made
equally
welcome
by
the
gardener
now
on
the
march
day
following
the
night
of
the
brothers
windy
talk
but
suddenly
martin
with
a
nimble
movement
stood
upright
on
his
bough
and
grasping
that
to
which
the
swing
was
attached
shook
it
with
such
frenzy
that
a
tempest
seemed
to
pass
through
the
tree
and
the
girls
shrieked
and
clung
to
the
trunk
and
leaves
and
apples
flew
in
all
directions
and
jessica
between
clutching
at
her
ropes
and
letting
go
to
ward
off
the
cannonade
of
fruit
gasped
in
a
tumult
of
laughter
and
indignation
jessica
have
you
gone
mad
master
pippin
have
you
gone
mad
martin
mad
mistress
jessica
stark
staring
mad
march
hares
are
pet
rabbits
to
me
jessica
sit
down
this
instant
do
you
hear
this
instant
better
what
fun
it
was
aha
you
thought
you
could
shake
me
off
but
you
did
are
you
still
mad
martin
melancholy
mad
since
you
will
not
let
me
rave
jessica
you
are
the
less
dangerous
but
i
hate
you
to
be
melancholy
martin
it
is
no
one
fault
but
yours
how
can
i
be
jolly
when
my
story
upsets
you
jessica
how
do
you
know
it
upsets
me
martin
you
put
out
your
tongue
at
me
jessica
did
i
martin
yes
without
reason
so
what
could
i
do
but
whistle
mine
to
the
winds
jessica
you
were
too
hasty
for
i
had
my
reason
martin
if
it
was
a
good
one
i
whistle
mine
back
again
jessica
it
was
this
that
no
man
in
a
should
be
wiser
or
braver
or
more
beautiful
or
more
happy
than
the
hero
or
how
can
he
be
the
hero
yet
i
am
sure
hobb
is
the
hero
and
none
of
the
others
because
he
is
the
only
one
old
enough
to
be
married
martin
ambrose
in
nineteen
and
will
very
soon
be
twenty
jessica
what
nineteen
or
even
twenty
in
a
man
fie
a
man
not
a
man
till
he
comes
of
age
and
the
hero
not
ambrose
for
all
his
wisdom
though
wisdom
becomes
a
hero
nor
heriot
for
all
his
beauty
though
a
hero
should
be
beautiful
nor
hugh
who
will
one
day
be
brave
enough
for
any
hero
though
now
he
but
a
boy
nor
the
happy
lionel
who
is
only
a
child
yet
i
love
a
gay
hero
it
none
of
these
full
though
they
be
of
the
qualities
of
heroes
and
here
is
your
hobb
with
nothing
to
show
but
a
fondness
for
roses
martin
you
deserve
to
be
stood
in
a
corner
for
that
nothing
mistress
jessica
your
reason
was
such
a
bad
one
that
i
see
i
must
return
to
sense
if
only
to
teach
you
a
little
of
it
did
i
not
say
hobb
had
a
loving
heart
jessica
but
he
was
plain
and
simple
and
patient
and
contented
are
these
things
for
a
hero
martin
mistress
jessica
i
will
ask
you
a
riddle
what
is
it
oh
but
first
i
take
it
you
love
jessica
who
does
martin
what
is
it
then
you
love
in
an
is
it
the
dancing
of
the
leaves
in
the
wind
is
it
the
boldness
of
the
boughs
or
perhaps
the
loveliness
of
the
flower
in
spring
or
again
the
fruit
that
ripens
of
the
flower
amongst
the
leaves
on
the
boughs
what
is
it
you
love
in
an
jessica
all
riddles
are
traps
i
must
consider
before
i
answer
martin
you
shall
consider
until
the
conclusion
of
my
story
and
not
till
you
are
satisfied
that
many
things
can
be
contained
in
one
will
i
require
your
solution
and
as
for
traps
it
is
always
the
solver
of
riddles
who
lays
his
own
trap
by
looking
all
round
the
question
and
never
straight
at
it
put
on
your
i
beg
while
i
go
on
babbling
on
the
march
day
following
the
brothers
talk
continued
martin
lionel
was
missing
it
was
some
time
before
his
absence
was
noticed
for
hobb
was
in
his
distant
garden
and
ambrose
among
his
books
and
heriot
had
ridden
north
to
the
to
buy
stuff
for
a
jerkin
and
hugh
had
run
south
to
the
sea
to
watch
the
ships
so
lionel
was
left
to
his
own
devices
and
what
they
were
none
tried
to
guess
till
evening
when
the
brothers
met
again
and
he
was
not
there
then
there
was
hue
and
cry
among
the
hills
but
to
no
purpose
the
child
had
vanished
like
a
cloud
and
the
month
wore
by
and
their
hearts
grew
heavier
day
by
day
it
was
in
the
last
week
of
march
that
hugh
one
morning
came
to
his
brothers
and
said
i
am
going
away
and
i
will
not
come
back
until
i
have
found
lionel
for
i
ca
rest
none
of
us
can
do
that
said
ambrose
and
we
have
searched
and
sent
messengers
everywhere
you
are
too
young
to
go
alone
i
am
nearly
fourteen
said
hugh
and
stronger
than
heriot
and
even
than
you
ambrose
and
i
can
take
care
of
myself
and
lionel
too
there
are
more
ways
than
one
to
seek
and
i
go
my
way
while
you
go
yours
but
i
will
find
him
or
die
and
he
looked
with
defiance
at
ambrose
and
then
turned
to
hobb
and
said
doggedly
i
going
hobb
hobb
who
himself
sought
the
hills
unwearingly
day
after
day
and
then
sat
up
three
parts
of
the
night
attending
to
the
duties
of
the
burgh
said
go
and
god
bless
you
and
hugh
mouth
grew
less
set
and
he
kissed
his
brothers
and
put
his
knife
in
his
belt
and
took
food
in
his
wallet
and
walked
out
of
the
burgh
he
followed
the
to
the
north
and
had
walked
less
than
when
the
wind
took
his
cap
and
blew
it
into
the
middle
of
a
pond
where
it
lay
soddening
out
of
reach
so
he
took
off
his
shoes
and
walked
into
the
pond
to
fetch
it
out
stirring
up
the
yellow
mud
in
thick
soft
clouds
but
as
he
stooped
to
grab
his
cap
something
else
stirred
the
mud
in
the
middle
and
a
body
heaved
itself
sluggishly
into
view
at
first
hugh
thought
it
must
be
the
body
of
a
sheep
that
had
tumbled
into
the
water
but
to
his
amazement
the
sulky
head
of
an
old
man
appeared
he
was
barely
distinguishable
from
the
mud
out
of
which
he
had
risen
drat
the
boys
said
the
muddy
man
will
they
never
be
done
with
disturbing
the
newts
and
me
drat
em
i
say
who
are
you
demanded
hugh
staring
with
all
his
might
jerry
i
am
and
this
is
my
pond
why
ca
you
leave
me
in
peace
the
wind
took
my
cap
said
hugh
finding
keepings
said
the
muddy
man
taking
the
cap
himself
and
windfalls
on
this
water
is
mine
so
i
keep
your
cap
and
it
the
second
wind
brought
me
this
march
and
if
you
in
want
of
another
you
best
go
to
where
wind
lives
and
ask
him
for
it
like
one
but
he
said
he
ask
for
a
toy
farm
instead
a
toy
farm
shouted
hugh
go
away
and
do
deafen
a
body
said
jerry
and
prepared
to
sink
again
but
hugh
caught
him
by
the
hair
and
said
fiercely
keep
my
cap
if
you
like
but
i
wo
let
you
go
until
you
tell
me
where
my
brother
went
your
brother
was
it
growled
the
muddy
man
he
went
to
high
and
over
dancing
like
a
sunbeam
what
high
and
over
where
wind
lives
where
that
find
out
mumbled
the
muddy
man
and
he
wriggled
himself
out
of
hugh
clutch
and
buried
himself
like
a
monstrous
newt
in
the
mud
and
though
hugh
groped
and
fumbled
he
could
not
feel
a
trace
of
him
but
said
he
there
at
least
a
name
to
go
on
and
he
got
out
of
the
pond
and
went
in
search
of
high
and
over
and
his
brothers
waited
in
vain
for
his
return
and
the
heaviness
of
four
hearts
was
now
divided
between
three
and
doubled
because
of
another
brother
lost
but
on
the
first
of
april
which
was
lionel
birthday
lionel
came
back
or
rather
hobb
found
him
in
a
valley
north
of
his
garden
hill
when
he
was
wandering
on
one
of
his
forlorn
searches
and
when
he
found
him
hobb
could
not
believe
his
eyes
for
the
child
was
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
prettiest
plaything
in
the
world
it
was
a
tiny
farm
covering
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
acre
with
minute
barns
and
yards
and
stables
and
pigmy
livestock
in
the
little
pastures
and
crops
in
the
little
meadows
and
smoke
came
from
the
tiny
chimney
of
the
farmhouse
and
lionel
was
drawing
water
from
a
well
in
a
bucket
the
size
of
a
thimble
and
all
the
colors
were
so
bright
and
painted
that
the
little
farmstead
seemed
to
have
been
conceived
of
the
gayest
mind
on
earth
but
through
his
amazement
hobb
had
no
thought
except
for
the
child
and
he
ran
calling
him
by
his
name
but
lionel
never
looked
up
and
then
hobb
lifted
him
in
his
arms
and
embraced
him
closely
but
the
child
did
not
respond
then
hobb
looked
at
him
anxiously
and
was
so
shocked
that
he
forgot
the
strange
blithe
little
farm
entirely
for
lionel
was
as
wan
and
wasted
as
though
he
had
been
through
a
fever
and
his
rosy
face
was
white
and
his
merry
eyes
were
melancholy
and
suddenly
as
hobb
clasped
him
he
flung
his
arms
round
his
big
brother
neck
and
buried
his
face
in
his
bosom
and
wept
bitterly
then
hobb
tried
to
soothe
and
comfort
him
asking
him
little
questions
in
a
coaxing
voice
where
has
the
child
been
why
did
he
run
away
and
leave
us
where
did
he
get
this
pretty
wonderful
toy
is
he
hurt
or
hungry
does
he
remember
it
is
his
birthday
there
will
be
presents
for
him
at
the
burgh
and
a
cake
for
tea
did
hugh
bring
him
home
has
he
seen
hugh
lal
lal
where
is
hugh
but
lionel
answered
none
of
these
questions
he
only
sobbed
and
sobbed
and
suddenly
slipped
out
of
hobb
arms
and
began
to
play
once
more
with
his
farm
while
the
tears
ran
down
his
thin
cheeks
presently
he
let
hobb
take
him
home
and
there
heriot
and
ambrose
rejoiced
and
sorrowed
over
him
for
he
would
scarcely
speak
or
eat
and
only
shook
his
head
at
their
questions
at
hugh
name
his
tears
flowed
twice
as
fast
but
he
would
tell
them
nothing
of
him
very
soon
hobb
carried
him
to
bed
and
in
undressing
him
noticed
that
he
had
no
shirt
this
too
lionel
would
not
explain
and
hobb
ceased
troubling
him
with
talk
and
knelt
and
prayed
by
him
and
laid
him
down
to
sleep
hoping
that
in
the
morning
he
would
be
better
but
morning
brought
no
change
lionel
from
that
day
was
given
up
to
grief
each
morning
he
went
dejectedly
to
play
with
his
marvelous
toy
in
the
valley
but
how
he
came
by
it
he
would
not
say
towards
the
end
of
april
heriot
came
to
hobb
and
ambrose
and
said
i
can
not
bear
this
lionel
is
home
and
we
are
none
the
better
for
it
and
hugh
is
gone
and
we
are
all
the
worse
hugh
is
capable
of
looking
after
himself
yet
perhaps
danger
has
befallen
him
and
even
if
not
he
will
roam
the
country
fruitlessly
for
months
and
it
may
be
years
since
lionel
is
restored
and
he
does
not
know
it
the
burgh
can
spare
me
better
than
it
can
you
and
i
will
ride
abroad
and
see
if
i
can
find
him
and
return
in
seven
days
whether
or
no
so
they
embraced
him
and
he
departed
but
at
the
end
of
seven
days
he
did
not
appear
and
ambrose
and
hobb
were
dismayed
at
his
vanishing
like
the
others
and
so
heavy
a
gloom
descended
on
the
burgh
that
each
could
scarcely
have
endured
it
without
the
other
and
every
day
they
went
forth
in
search
of
hugh
and
heriot
or
of
traces
of
them
but
found
none
then
it
happened
that
on
the
first
of
may
which
was
hugh
birthday
hobb
wandering
further
north
than
usual
to
the
brow
of
the
great
ridge
east
of
the
ouse
heard
a
wild
roaring
and
bellowing
on
the
downs
or
rather
it
was
two
separate
roarings
as
you
may
sometimes
hear
two
separate
storms
thundering
at
once
over
two
ranges
of
hills
and
in
astonishment
he
went
first
to
beddingham
and
there
bound
by
an
iron
chain
to
a
stake
beside
a
pond
he
found
a
mighty
lion
as
white
as
a
young
lamb
but
he
had
not
a
lamb
meekness
for
he
ramped
and
raved
in
a
great
circle
around
the
stake
and
his
open
throat
set
in
his
shaggy
mane
looked
like
the
red
sun
seen
upon
white
mist
hobb
rubbed
his
eyes
and
turned
towards
ilford
where
the
second
roaring
sought
to
outdo
the
first
and
there
beside
another
pond
he
found
another
stake
and
chain
and
a
lion
exactly
similar
except
that
he
was
as
red
as
a
rose
but
he
had
not
a
rose
sweetness
for
he
snarled
and
leaped
with
fury
at
the
end
of
his
chain
and
his
flashing
teeth
under
his
red
muzzle
looked
like
the
blossom
of
the
scarlet
runner
and
then
turning
about
for
an
explanation
of
these
wonders
hobb
saw
what
drove
them
from
his
mind
the
figure
of
hugh
crouched
in
a
little
hollow
and
shaking
like
a
leaf
hobb
ran
towards
him
with
a
shout
and
at
the
shout
hugh
leaped
to
his
feet
with
the
eyes
of
a
hunted
hare
and
looked
on
all
sides
as
though
seeking
where
to
hide
but
hobb
was
soon
beside
him
with
his
arm
round
the
boy
shoulder
and
gazing
earnestly
into
his
face
why
lad
said
he
do
you
not
know
me
again
hugh
stole
a
glance
at
him
and
suddenly
smiled
and
nodded
and
tried
to
answer
but
could
not
for
the
chattering
of
his
teeth
and
he
clung
hard
to
his
brother
side
and
shuddered
from
head
to
foot
are
you
ill
hugh
hobb
asked
him
bewildered
at
the
boy
unlikeness
to
himself
no
hobb
said
hugh
but
need
we
stay
here
now
why
no
said
hobb
gently
we
will
go
when
you
like
where
do
these
beasts
come
from
hugh
set
his
lips
and
began
to
move
away
hobb
went
beside
him
and
said
lionel
is
home
but
heriot
is
lost
have
you
seen
heriot
hugh
hesitated
and
then
stammered
no
i
have
not
seen
him
and
hobb
knew
that
he
had
lied
hugh
who
had
always
been
as
fearless
of
the
truth
as
of
anything
else
so
after
that
he
asked
no
more
fearing
to
get
another
lie
for
an
answer
and
he
led
hugh
home
supporting
him
with
his
arm
for
he
was
full
of
fits
and
starts
and
shiverings
if
a
lump
of
chalk
rolled
under
his
shoe
he
blanched
and
cried
that
and
once
when
a
ran
across
the
path
he
swooned
then
hobb
opening
his
tunic
at
the
neck
saw
that
nothing
was
between
it
and
his
body
for
he
like
lionel
was
without
his
shirt
they
got
back
to
the
burgh
and
hobb
found
ambrose
and
told
him
how
it
was
and
ambrose
came
to
hugh
and
talked
with
him
and
turned
away
with
knitted
brows
for
here
was
a
puzzle
not
dealt
with
in
his
books
and
may
went
by
in
miserable
fashion
with
lionel
spending
the
days
in
playing
mournfully
beside
his
farm
and
hugh
in
cowering
abjectly
between
his
lions
and
sometimes
ambrose
and
hobb
after
searching
for
heriot
or
news
of
him
or
spending
their
spirits
in
endeavoring
to
hearten
their
two
brothers
or
to
elicit
from
them
something
that
should
give
them
the
key
to
the
mystery
would
meet
in
where
seemed
to
be
the
only
peace
and
loveliness
left
upon
earth
and
hobb
would
weed
and
tend
his
neglected
flowers
and
they
bloomed
for
him
as
though
they
knew
he
loved
them
as
indeed
they
did
only
his
golden
would
not
flourish
but
this
small
sorrow
was
unguessed
by
ambrose
one
evening
as
they
sat
in
the
garden
in
the
last
week
of
may
ambrose
said
to
his
brother
i
have
been
thinking
hobb
that
at
all
costs
heriot
must
be
found
and
not
for
his
own
sake
only
he
is
younger
than
we
and
nearer
in
spirit
to
the
boys
and
he
may
be
able
to
help
them
as
we
can
not
for
if
this
goes
on
hugh
will
die
of
his
fears
and
lionel
of
his
melancholy
you
must
stay
and
administer
our
affairs
as
usual
and
look
after
the
boys
and
i
will
go
further
afield
in
search
of
heriot
hobb
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
he
sighed
and
said
no
good
has
come
of
these
seekings
our
lads
returned
of
themselves
as
heriot
may
and
their
return
was
worse
than
anything
we
feared
of
their
absence
as
if
he
come
back
i
pray
heriot
will
not
be
and
for
you
ambrose
but
then
he
paused
not
saying
what
was
in
his
mind
and
ambrose
said
do
not
be
afraid
for
me
these
boys
are
young
and
i
am
older
than
my
years
and
though
i
can
not
face
danger
with
a
stouter
heart
than
our
brothers
i
can
perhaps
see
into
it
a
little
further
than
they
and
foresight
is
sometimes
a
still
better
tool
than
courage
then
he
took
hobb
hand
in
his
and
they
gripped
with
the
grip
of
men
who
love
each
other
and
ambrose
went
out
of
the
garden
and
hobb
was
left
alone
for
hugh
and
lionel
were
companions
to
none
but
themselves
but
on
the
first
of
june
hobb
coming
to
the
gate
of
his
garden
saw
with
surprise
a
peacock
strutting
on
the
hillbrow
his
fan
spread
in
the
sun
a
luster
of
green
and
blue
and
gold
and
behind
him
was
another
and
further
south
three
more
so
hobb
went
out
to
look
at
them
and
found
not
five
but
fifty
peacocks
sweeping
the
downs
with
their
heavy
trains
or
opening
and
shutting
them
like
gigantic
magical
flowers
following
the
throng
of
birds
he
came
shortly
to
a
barn
already
known
to
him
but
he
had
never
seen
it
as
he
saw
it
now
for
the
roof
was
crowded
with
peacocks
and
peacocks
strayed
in
flocks
within
and
without
and
sitting
in
the
doorway
was
heriot
the
sight
of
whom
so
overjoyed
his
brother
that
hobb
forgot
the
thousand
peacocks
in
the
one
man
and
he
made
speed
to
greet
him
but
within
a
few
yards
halted
full
of
doubt
for
was
this
heriot
he
had
heriot
air
and
attitude
yet
the
grace
was
gone
from
his
body
and
heriot
features
surely
but
the
beauty
had
melted
away
like
morning
dew
and
his
dress
which
had
always
been
orderly
and
beautiful
was
neglected
so
that
under
the
jerkin
hobb
saw
that
he
was
shirtless
yet
after
the
first
moment
shock
he
knew
this
gaunt
and
ugly
youth
was
heriot
and
heriot
seeing
his
coming
hung
his
head
and
made
a
shamed
movement
of
retreat
into
the
shadow
of
the
barn
but
hobb
hurried
to
him
and
took
him
by
the
shoulders
and
beheld
him
with
the
eyes
of
love
which
always
find
its
object
beautiful
then
the
flush
faded
from
haggard
cheeks
and
he
looked
as
full
at
hobb
as
hobb
at
him
and
as
at
the
steadfast
meeting
of
eyes
men
see
no
longer
the
physical
appearance
but
for
an
eternal
instance
the
appearance
of
the
soul
these
brothers
knew
that
they
were
to
each
other
what
they
had
always
been
and
heriot
saw
that
hobb
was
full
of
questions
and
he
laid
his
hand
over
hobb
mouth
and
said
hobb
do
not
ask
me
anything
for
i
can
tell
you
nothing
neither
of
yourself
nor
of
ambrose
said
hobb
nothing
repeated
heriot
so
hobb
left
his
questions
unspoken
and
as
they
went
home
together
told
heriot
of
hugh
return
and
what
had
happened
to
him
and
heriot
heard
it
without
comment
and
in
the
evening
when
lionel
and
hugh
returned
they
had
nothing
to
say
to
heriot
nor
he
to
them
and
it
seemed
to
hobb
that
this
was
because
these
three
everything
was
understood
it
was
a
lonely
june
for
hobb
with
his
eldest
brother
away
and
the
three
others
spending
all
their
days
beside
their
strange
possessions
which
brought
them
no
tittle
of
joy
and
had
it
not
been
for
his
garden
he
would
have
felt
utterly
bereft
yet
here
too
failure
sat
heavily
on
his
heart
for
an
many
a
night
he
saw
upon
his
bush
a
bud
that
promised
perfection
to
come
and
in
the
morning
it
hung
dead
and
rotten
on
its
stem
so
the
month
wore
on
and
hobb
began
to
feel
that
the
burgh
where
now
his
brothers
only
came
to
sleep
was
a
dead
shell
too
desolate
to
inhabit
if
ambrose
did
not
soon
return
and
he
was
impelled
to
go
in
search
of
him
yet
decided
to
remain
until
ambrose
birthday
had
dawned
for
had
not
their
birthdays
brought
his
three
youngest
brothers
home
and
it
might
be
so
with
ambrose
and
so
it
was
for
on
the
first
of
july
before
going
to
his
garden
he
stayed
at
heriot
barn
to
try
to
induce
him
to
leave
his
peacocks
for
once
and
spend
the
day
with
him
in
search
of
ambrose
but
heriot
who
was
feeding
his
fowl
never
looked
up
and
said
sadly
what
need
to
seek
ambrose
ambrose
has
returned
have
you
seen
him
cried
hobb
joyfully
early
this
morning
said
heriot
where
down
yonder
in
poverty
bottom
said
heriot
pointing
south
of
his
barn
to
a
hollow
that
went
by
that
name
for
there
was
a
dismal
habitation
that
had
fallen
into
decay
a
skeleton
of
a
hut
with
only
two
rotting
walls
and
a
riddled
thatch
for
a
roof
and
it
was
worse
than
no
habitation
at
all
for
what
might
have
been
a
green
and
lovely
vale
was
made
desolate
and
rank
with
disused
things
rusting
among
the
lumber
of
bricks
and
nettles
it
was
enough
to
have
been
there
once
never
to
go
again
and
hobb
had
been
there
once
but
now
at
heriot
tidings
he
ran
down
the
hill
a
second
time
as
though
it
led
to
paradise
calling
ambrose
as
he
went
and
getting
no
answer
he
began
to
fear
that
either
heriot
was
mistaken
or
ambrose
had
gone
away
his
fears
were
unfounded
for
coming
to
the
bottom
he
found
ambrose
yet
he
had
to
look
twice
to
make
sure
it
was
he
for
he
was
dressed
only
in
rags
and
less
in
rags
than
nakedness
and
his
skin
was
dirty
and
his
hair
unkempt
he
was
stooping
about
the
ground
gathering
flints
dropped
through
and
a
small
trail
of
them
marked
his
passage
over
the
rank
grass
hobb
strode
towards
him
with
dread
in
his
bosom
and
laid
his
hand
on
ambrose
wild
head
saying
his
name
again
and
at
this
his
brother
looked
up
and
eyed
him
childishly
and
said
who
is
ambrose
and
then
the
dread
in
hobb
took
a
definite
shape
and
he
saw
with
horror
that
ambrose
had
lost
his
wits
at
that
knowledge
and
the
sight
of
his
neglected
body
and
pitiful
foolish
smile
hobb
turned
away
and
sobbed
but
ambrose
with
a
little
random
laugh
continued
to
drop
flints
in
his
bottomless
bucket
and
no
word
of
hobb
could
win
him
from
that
place
then
hobb
went
back
to
the
burgh
alone
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
thought
he
thought
of
the
evil
which
had
fallen
upon
his
house
the
nature
of
which
was
past
his
brothers
telling
and
far
beyond
his
guessing
and
he
said
to
himself
i
have
done
the
best
i
could
in
governing
the
affairs
of
the
burgh
and
of
our
people
since
the
others
were
younger
than
i
but
i
see
i
have
been
selfish
keeping
safety
for
my
portion
while
they
went
into
danger
and
now
there
is
none
to
set
this
evil
right
but
i
and
if
i
can
i
must
follow
the
way
they
went
and
do
better
than
they
at
the
end
of
it
and
if
i
fail
as
how
should
i
succeed
where
they
have
not
and
if
like
them
i
too
must
suffer
the
dreadful
loss
of
a
part
of
myself
let
it
be
so
and
i
shall
at
least
fare
as
they
have
fared
and
we
will
share
an
equal
fate
though
what
i
have
to
lose
i
know
not
to
match
their
bright
and
noble
qualities
then
he
called
his
steward
and
gave
all
the
affairs
of
the
burgh
into
his
hands
and
bade
him
have
an
eye
to
his
brothers
as
far
as
possible
and
to
consult
heriot
in
any
need
since
he
was
the
only
one
who
could
in
the
least
be
relied
on
and
then
he
walked
out
of
the
burgh
as
he
was
and
went
where
his
feet
took
him
he
had
not
been
walking
when
a
sudden
blast
of
wind
tore
the
cap
from
his
head
and
blew
it
into
the
very
middle
of
a
pond
now
the
pond
was
exceedingly
muddy
and
as
it
seemed
to
hobb
rather
deep
and
he
was
wondering
whether
his
old
cap
were
worth
wading
for
and
had
almost
decided
to
abandon
it
when
he
saw
a
skinny
yellow
arm
like
a
frog
leg
stretch
up
through
the
water
and
a
hand
that
dripped
with
slime
grope
for
his
cap
with
three
strides
he
was
in
the
pond
and
he
caught
the
cap
and
the
hand
together
in
his
fist
the
hand
writhed
in
his
but
hobb
was
too
strong
for
it
and
with
a
mighty
tug
he
dragged
first
the
shoulder
and
then
the
head
belonging
to
the
hand
into
view
they
were
the
shoulder
and
head
of
the
muddy
man
whom
you
dear
maidens
have
seen
once
before
in
this
tale
but
whom
hobb
had
never
seen
till
then
and
jerry
said
drat
these
losers
of
caps
will
they
never
be
done
with
disturbing
the
newts
and
me
tis
the
fifth
in
a
summer
and
first
there
one
with
a
step
like
a
wagtail
and
next
there
one
as
bold
as
a
hawk
and
after
him
one
as
comely
as
a
wild
swan
and
last
was
one
as
wise
as
an
owl
and
now
there
this
one
with
nothing
particular
to
him
but
he
grips
as
hard
as
all
the
rest
rolled
into
one
drat
these
then
hobb
who
for
all
his
surprise
to
begin
with
and
his
increase
of
excitement
as
the
muddy
creature
spoke
had
never
slackened
his
grasp
said
old
man
you
are
welcome
to
my
cap
if
you
will
tell
me
what
happened
to
the
wearers
of
the
four
other
caps
after
they
left
you
how
do
i
know
what
happened
to
em
growled
the
muddy
man
for
they
all
went
to
high
and
over
and
after
that
twas
nobody
business
but
wind
who
lives
there
where
high
and
over
said
hobb
find
out
said
the
muddy
man
and
gave
a
wriggle
that
did
him
no
good
i
will
said
hobb
for
you
shall
tell
me
and
he
looked
so
sternly
at
the
muddy
man
that
jerry
cringed
moaning
i
thought
by
his
voice
twas
a
turtle
but
i
see
by
his
eye
tis
an
eagle
if
you
must
know
you
must
and
south
of
cradle
hill
that
south
of
pinchem
that
south
of
hobb
hawth
that
south
of
the
burgh
that
south
of
this
pond
is
where
high
and
over
is
and
i
thank
you
to
let
me
go
nevertheless
when
hobb
released
him
jerry
forgot
the
thanks
and
disappeared
into
the
mud
taking
the
cap
with
him
but
hobb
did
not
care
for
his
thanks
he
hurried
south
as
fast
as
his
feet
would
carry
him
going
by
the
places
he
knew
and
then
by
those
he
did
not
till
he
came
at
nightfall
to
high
and
over
and
on
high
and
over
a
great
wind
was
blowing
from
all
the
four
quarters
of
heaven
at
once
and
hobb
was
caught
up
in
the
crossways
of
the
wind
and
turned
about
and
about
till
he
was
dizzy
and
all
his
thoughts
were
churning
in
his
brain
so
that
he
could
not
tell
one
from
the
other
and
at
the
very
crisis
of
the
churning
a
voice
in
the
wind
from
the
north
roared
in
his
ear
what
do
you
want
that
you
lack
and
a
voice
from
the
south
murmured
what
is
the
wish
of
your
heart
and
a
voice
from
the
west
sighed
what
is
it
that
life
has
not
given
you
and
a
voice
from
the
east
shrieked
what
will
you
have
and
lose
yourself
to
have
and
hobb
forgot
his
brothers
and
why
he
was
there
he
forgot
everything
but
the
dream
of
his
soul
which
had
been
churned
uppermost
in
that
turmoil
and
he
cried
aloud
a
golden
rose
then
the
four
voices
together
roared
and
murmured
and
sighed
and
shrieked
open
winkins
open
winkins
open
winkins
open
winkins
and
the
tumult
ceased
with
a
shock
and
the
shock
of
silence
overwhelmed
hobb
with
sickness
and
darkness
and
his
senses
deserted
him
as
he
became
unconscious
he
seemed
to
be
not
falling
to
earth
but
rising
in
the
air
when
he
opened
his
eyes
he
was
lying
on
his
back
in
a
strange
world
a
world
of
trees
whose
noble
trunks
rose
up
as
though
they
were
columns
of
the
sky
but
their
heaven
was
a
green
one
shutting
out
daylight
yet
enclosing
a
luminous
haunted
air
of
its
own
such
forests
were
unknown
in
hobb
open
barren
land
and
this
alone
would
have
made
his
coming
to
his
senses
appear
rather
to
be
a
coming
away
from
them
but
he
scarcely
noticed
his
surroundings
he
was
only
vaguely
aware
of
them
as
the
strange
and
beautiful
setting
of
the
strangest
and
most
beautiful
thing
he
had
ever
seen
for
he
was
looking
into
the
eyes
of
the
loveliest
woman
in
the
world
she
was
bending
above
him
tall
and
slim
and
supple
her
perfect
body
clad
in
a
deep
black
gown
the
hem
and
bosom
of
which
were
embroidered
with
celandines
and
it
had
a
golden
belt
and
was
lined
with
gold
as
he
could
see
when
the
loose
sleeves
fell
open
on
her
round
and
slender
arms
and
the
bodice
of
the
gown
hung
a
little
away
from
her
stooping
body
and
was
embroidered
inside
as
well
as
outside
with
celandines
which
made
reflections
on
her
white
neck
as
they
will
on
a
pure
pool
where
they
lean
to
watch
their
april
loveliness
her
skin
was
as
creamy
as
the
petals
of
a
burnet
rose
and
her
eyes
were
the
color
of
and
her
hair
was
as
soft
as
spun
silk
and
fell
in
two
great
shining
waves
of
the
purest
gold
over
her
bosom
as
she
bent
above
him
and
lay
on
the
earth
like
golden
grass
on
green
water
a
tress
of
the
hair
had
flowed
across
his
hand
and
about
her
small
fine
head
it
was
bound
with
a
black
fillet
a
narrow
coil
so
sleek
and
glossy
that
it
was
touched
with
silver
lights
and
this
intense
blackness
made
the
gold
of
her
head
more
dazzling
and
hobb
lay
there
bewildered
under
the
spell
of
her
loveliness
asking
nothing
but
to
lie
and
gaze
at
it
for
ever
but
presently
as
he
did
not
move
she
did
sinking
upon
her
knees
and
stooping
closer
so
that
her
breast
nearly
rested
on
his
own
and
she
put
her
white
hand
softly
on
his
forehead
and
the
smoke
of
her
eyes
was
washed
with
tears
that
did
not
fall
and
she
said
in
a
tremulous
voice
that
fell
on
his
ears
like
music
heard
in
a
dream
oh
stranger
if
you
are
not
dying
speak
and
move
then
hobb
raised
himself
slowly
on
his
elbow
and
as
she
did
not
stir
their
faces
were
brought
very
close
together
and
not
for
an
instant
had
they
taken
their
eyes
from
each
other
and
he
said
in
a
low
voice
not
knowing
either
his
voice
or
his
own
words
i
am
not
dying
but
i
think
i
must
be
dead
and
suddenly
the
woman
broke
into
a
rain
of
tears
and
she
sank
into
his
arms
with
her
own
about
his
neck
and
she
wept
upon
his
heart
as
though
her
own
were
breaking
after
a
few
moments
she
lifted
her
head
and
hobb
bent
his
to
meet
her
quivering
mouth
but
before
his
lips
touched
hers
she
tore
herself
from
his
hold
and
fled
away
through
the
trees
hobb
leaped
to
his
feet
and
scarcely
knowing
what
he
said
cried
love
do
be
afraid
and
he
made
no
attempt
to
follow
her
but
stood
where
he
was
he
saw
her
halt
in
the
distance
and
turn
and
hesitate
and
struggle
with
herself
as
to
her
coming
or
going
at
last
she
decided
for
the
former
and
came
slowly
between
the
pillars
of
the
trees
until
she
stood
but
a
few
paces
from
him
with
lowered
lids
and
she
said
sweetly
forgive
me
stranger
but
i
found
you
here
like
one
dead
and
when
you
opened
your
eyes
the
fear
was
still
on
me
and
when
you
moved
and
spoke
the
relief
was
too
great
and
i
forgot
myself
and
did
what
i
did
then
hobb
said
gently
but
with
his
heart
beating
on
his
ribs
as
fast
as
a
swallow
wings
beat
the
air
i
thought
you
did
what
you
did
because
at
that
moment
you
knew
and
i
knew
also
that
it
was
your
right
for
ever
to
weep
and
to
laugh
on
my
heart
and
mine
to
bear
for
ever
your
laughing
and
weeping
but
if
it
was
not
with
you
as
with
me
say
so
and
i
will
go
away
and
not
trouble
you
or
your
strange
woods
again
then
the
woman
came
quickly
to
him
and
seized
his
hands
saying
half
agitated
half
commanding
it
was
with
me
as
with
you
and
you
shall
stay
with
me
for
ever
in
these
woods
and
i
will
give
you
the
desire
of
your
life
and
what
shall
i
give
you
said
hobb
whatever
is
nearest
to
yourself
she
whispered
the
dearest
treasure
of
your
soul
and
she
looked
at
him
with
eyes
full
of
passions
which
he
could
not
fathom
but
among
them
he
saw
terror
and
with
great
tenderness
he
drew
her
once
more
to
his
heart
putting
his
strong
and
steady
arms
around
her
like
a
shield
and
he
said
love
whose
name
i
do
not
know
what
is
nearer
to
myself
than
you
what
dearer
treasure
has
my
soul
than
you
if
i
am
to
give
you
this
it
is
yourself
i
must
give
you
and
i
will
restore
to
you
whatever
it
is
that
you
have
lost
through
the
agony
of
your
soul
be
at
peace
my
love
whose
name
i
do
not
know
and
holding
her
closely
to
him
he
bent
his
head
and
kissed
her
lips
and
a
great
shudder
passed
through
her
and
then
she
lay
still
in
his
arms
with
her
strange
eyes
and
slow
tears
welling
between
the
lids
and
hanging
on
her
cheeks
like
the
rain
on
the
rose
and
she
let
him
quiet
her
with
his
big
hands
that
were
so
used
to
care
for
flowers
presently
she
lifted
his
right
hand
to
her
mouth
and
kissed
it
before
he
could
prevent
her
next
she
drew
herself
a
little
away
from
him
hanging
back
in
his
arms
and
gazing
into
his
face
as
though
her
soul
were
all
a
question
and
his
was
the
answer
that
she
could
not
wholly
read
and
last
she
broke
away
from
him
with
a
strange
laugh
that
ended
on
a
sob
hobb
said
will
you
not
tell
me
what
makes
you
unhappy
i
have
no
unhappiness
she
answered
and
quenched
her
sob
with
a
smile
as
strange
as
her
laugh
my
foolish
lover
are
you
amazed
that
when
her
hour
comes
a
woman
knows
not
whether
she
is
happy
or
unhappy
oh
when
joy
is
so
great
that
it
has
come
full
circle
with
pain
what
wonder
that
laughter
and
weeping
are
one
and
hobb
believed
her
for
ever
since
he
had
opened
his
eyes
upon
her
he
had
felt
in
his
own
heart
more
joy
than
he
could
bear
and
he
knew
that
for
this
there
is
no
remedy
except
to
find
a
second
heart
to
help
in
the
bearing
and
he
knew
it
was
the
same
with
her
but
now
he
saw
that
she
was
free
for
awhile
from
the
excess
of
joy
and
indeed
these
respites
must
happen
even
to
lovers
for
their
own
sakes
lest
they
sink
beneath
the
heavenly
burden
of
their
hearts
and
her
smile
was
like
the
diver
rise
from
his
enchanted
deeps
to
take
again
the
common
breath
of
man
and
hobb
also
smiled
and
said
come
now
and
tell
me
your
name
for
though
love
needs
none
for
its
object
i
think
the
name
itself
is
eager
to
be
made
known
and
loved
beyond
all
other
names
for
love
sake
as
i
love
yours
whatever
it
be
my
name
she
said
is
margaret
it
is
an
easy
name
to
love
said
hobb
for
its
own
sake
and
what
is
yours
asked
she
and
hobb
smile
broadened
as
he
answered
try
to
love
it
for
my
sake
for
it
is
hobb
yet
it
is
as
fitting
to
me
who
am
as
plain
as
my
name
as
your
lovely
name
is
fitting
to
you
she
cast
a
quick
sly
look
at
him
and
said
if
love
knows
not
how
to
distinguish
between
joy
and
pain
since
all
that
comes
from
the
heart
of
love
is
joy
neither
can
it
tell
the
plain
from
the
beautiful
since
all
that
comes
under
the
eye
of
love
is
beauty
and
i
will
find
all
things
beautiful
in
my
lover
from
his
name
to
the
mole
on
his
cheek
for
i
know
now
dear
maidens
whether
in
describing
him
i
had
mentioned
this
peculiarity
of
hobb
jessica
you
had
described
him
at
all
martin
well
now
the
omission
is
remedied
jessica
oh
fie
as
though
it
were
enough
to
say
the
man
had
a
mole
on
his
left
cheek
martin
dear
mistress
jessica
did
i
say
it
was
his
left
cheek
jessica
why
why
where
else
would
it
be
martin
nowhere
else
on
my
honor
it
was
his
left
cheek
then
hobb
said
to
margaret
what
place
is
this
it
is
called
open
winkins
said
she
and
at
the
name
he
started
to
his
feet
remembering
much
that
he
had
forgotten
she
looked
at
him
anxiously
and
cajolingly
and
said
you
are
not
going
away
but
he
hardly
heard
her
question
margaret
he
said
i
have
come
from
a
place
that
may
be
far
or
near
for
i
do
not
know
how
i
came
but
i
think
it
must
be
far
since
i
never
saw
this
forest
or
even
heard
of
it
till
a
moment
before
my
coming
but
i
am
seeking
a
clue
to
a
trouble
that
has
come
upon
me
this
year
and
i
think
the
clue
may
be
here
and
now
tell
me
have
you
in
these
last
four
months
seen
in
these
woods
anything
of
your
people
that
are
my
brothers
a
child
that
once
was
merry
and
a
boy
that
once
was
brave
and
a
youth
that
once
was
beautiful
and
a
young
man
that
once
was
wise
have
these
ever
been
to
open
winkins
margaret
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
and
said
if
they
have
i
have
not
seen
them
here
and
i
think
they
could
not
have
been
here
without
my
knowledge
for
no
one
lives
here
but
i
and
i
live
nowhere
else
hobb
sighed
and
said
i
had
hoped
otherwise
for
dear
i
can
not
rest
until
i
have
helped
them
then
he
told
her
as
much
as
he
knew
of
his
four
brothers
and
her
face
clouded
as
he
spoke
and
her
eyes
looked
hurt
and
angry
by
turns
and
her
beautiful
mouth
turned
sulky
so
then
hobb
put
his
arm
round
her
and
said
do
not
be
too
troubled
for
i
know
i
shall
presently
find
the
cause
and
cure
of
these
boys
ills
but
margaret
pushed
his
arm
away
and
rose
restlessly
to
her
feet
and
paced
up
and
down
muttering
what
do
i
care
for
these
boys
it
is
not
for
them
i
am
troubled
but
for
myself
and
you
for
us
said
hobb
how
can
trouble
touch
us
who
love
each
other
at
this
margaret
threw
herself
on
the
grass
beside
him
and
laid
her
head
against
his
knee
and
drew
his
hands
to
her
pressing
them
against
her
eyes
and
lips
and
throat
and
bosom
as
though
she
would
never
let
them
go
and
through
her
kisses
she
whispered
passionately
do
you
love
me
do
you
truly
love
me
oh
if
you
love
me
do
not
go
away
immediately
for
i
have
only
just
found
you
but
your
brothers
have
had
you
all
their
lives
and
presently
you
shall
go
where
you
please
for
their
sakes
but
now
stay
a
little
in
this
wood
for
mine
stay
a
month
with
me
only
a
month
oh
my
heart
is
a
month
much
to
ask
when
you
and
i
found
each
other
but
an
hour
ago
for
this
time
of
love
will
never
come
again
and
whatever
other
times
there
are
to
follow
if
you
go
now
you
will
be
shutting
your
eyes
upon
the
lovely
dawn
just
as
the
sun
is
rising
through
the
colors
and
when
you
return
you
will
return
perhaps
to
love
but
you
will
have
missed
the
dawn
for
ever
and
then
she
lifted
her
prone
body
a
little
higher
until
it
rested
once
more
in
the
curve
of
his
arm
against
his
heart
and
she
lay
with
her
white
face
upturned
to
his
and
her
dark
soft
eyes
full
of
passion
and
pleading
and
she
put
up
her
fingers
to
caress
his
cheek
and
whispered
give
me
my
little
month
oh
my
heart
and
at
the
end
of
it
i
will
give
you
your
soul
desire
and
not
hobb
or
any
man
could
have
resisted
her
so
he
promised
to
remain
with
her
in
open
winkins
and
not
to
go
further
on
his
quest
till
the
next
moon
and
indeed
with
all
time
before
and
behind
him
it
did
not
seem
much
to
promise
nor
did
he
think
it
could
hurt
his
brothers
case
but
the
kernel
of
it
was
that
he
longed
to
make
the
promise
and
could
not
do
otherwise
than
make
the
promise
and
so
in
short
he
made
the
promise
then
margaret
led
him
to
two
small
lodges
on
the
skirts
of
the
forest
they
were
made
of
round
logs
with
moss
and
lichen
still
upon
them
and
they
were
overgrown
with
the
loveliest
growths
of
summer
with
blackberry
blossoms
a
wonderful
ghostly
white
spread
over
the
bushes
like
fairies
linen
out
to
dry
and
wild
roses
more
than
were
in
any
other
lovers
forest
on
earth
and
the
maddest
sweetest
confusion
of
honeysuckle
you
ever
saw
within
the
rooms
were
strewn
with
green
rushes
and
hung
with
green
cloths
on
which
margaret
had
embroidered
all
the
flowers
and
berries
in
their
seasons
from
the
first
small
violets
blue
and
white
to
the
last
with
their
orange
hearts
splitting
their
rosy
rinds
and
there
was
nothing
else
under
each
roof
but
a
round
for
a
stool
and
a
coffer
of
carved
oak
with
metal
locks
and
a
low
mattress
stuffed
with
picked
from
the
thorns
and
pillows
filled
with
thistledown
and
each
couch
had
a
green
covering
worked
with
waterlily
leaves
and
white
and
golden
lilies
these
are
the
pilleygreen
lodges
said
she
and
one
is
mine
and
one
is
yours
and
when
we
want
cover
we
will
find
it
here
but
when
we
do
not
we
will
eat
and
sleep
in
the
open
and
so
the
whole
of
that
july
hobb
dwelt
in
the
pilleygreen
lodges
in
open
winkins
with
his
love
margaret
and
by
the
month
end
they
had
not
done
their
talking
for
did
not
a
young
lifetime
lie
behind
them
and
did
they
not
foresee
a
longer
life
ahead
and
between
lovers
must
not
all
be
told
and
dreamed
upon
and
beyond
these
lives
in
time
which
were
theirs
in
any
case
had
not
love
opened
to
them
a
timeless
life
of
which
inexhaustible
dreams
were
to
be
exchanged
not
always
by
words
though
indeed
by
their
mouths
and
by
the
speech
of
their
hands
and
arms
and
eyes
hobb
told
her
all
there
was
to
tell
of
the
burgh
and
his
life
with
his
brothers
both
before
and
after
their
tragedies
but
he
did
not
often
speak
of
them
for
it
was
a
tale
she
hated
to
hear
and
sometimes
she
wept
so
bitterly
that
he
had
ado
to
comfort
her
and
sometimes
was
so
angry
that
he
could
hardly
conciliate
her
but
such
was
his
own
gentleness
that
her
caprices
could
withstand
it
no
more
than
the
shifting
clouds
the
sun
and
margaret
told
him
of
herself
but
her
tale
was
short
and
simple
that
her
parents
had
died
in
the
forest
when
she
was
young
and
that
she
had
lived
there
all
her
life
working
with
her
needle
twice
yearly
taking
her
work
to
the
cathedral
town
to
sell
and
with
the
proceeds
buying
what
she
needed
and
other
cloths
and
silk
and
gold
with
which
to
work
she
opened
the
coffer
in
lodge
and
showed
him
what
she
did
veils
that
she
had
embroidered
with
cobwebs
hung
with
dew
so
that
you
feared
to
touch
them
lest
you
should
destroy
the
cobweb
and
disperse
the
dew
and
girdles
with
flowers
so
that
you
thought
spring
self
on
a
warm
day
had
loosed
the
girdle
from
her
middle
and
lost
it
and
gowns
worked
like
the
feathers
of
a
bird
some
like
the
plumage
on
the
breast
and
others
like
a
jay
wing
and
there
was
a
pair
of
blue
skippers
so
embroidered
that
they
appeared
and
disappeared
beneath
a
flowing
skirt
with
reeds
and
sallows
rising
from
a
hem
of
water
you
thought
you
had
seen
kingfishers
and
there
were
tunics
overlaid
with
dragonflies
wings
and
their
delicate
jointed
bodies
of
green
and
and
blue
and
caps
all
gay
with
autumn
berries
scarlet
and
haws
and
the
bright
briony
and
spindle
with
its
twofold
gayety
and
one
cap
was
all
of
wild
clematis
with
the
vine
of
the
traveler
joy
twined
round
the
brim
and
the
cloud
of
the
old
man
beard
upon
the
crown
and
hobb
said
it
is
magic
who
taught
you
to
do
this
and
margaret
said
open
winkins
early
in
their
talks
he
told
her
of
his
garden
and
of
the
golden
rose
he
tried
to
grow
there
and
of
his
failures
and
margaret
knew
by
his
voice
and
his
eyes
more
than
by
his
words
that
this
was
the
wish
of
his
heart
and
she
smiled
and
said
now
i
know
with
what
i
must
redeem
my
promise
yet
i
think
i
shall
be
jealous
of
your
golden
rose
and
hobb
lifting
a
wave
of
her
glittering
hair
and
making
a
rose
of
it
between
his
fingers
asked
how
can
you
be
jealous
of
yourself
yet
i
think
i
am
said
she
again
for
it
was
something
of
myself
you
promised
to
give
me
presently
and
i
would
rather
have
something
of
you
they
are
the
same
thing
said
hobb
and
he
twisted
up
the
great
rose
of
her
hair
till
it
lay
beside
her
temple
under
the
ebony
fillet
and
as
his
hand
touched
the
fillet
he
looked
puzzled
and
he
ran
his
finger
round
its
shining
blackness
and
exclaimed
but
this
too
is
hair
margaret
laughed
her
strange
laugh
and
said
yes
my
own
hair
you
discoverer
of
open
secrets
and
putting
up
her
hands
she
unbound
the
fillet
and
it
fell
a
slender
coil
of
black
amongst
the
golden
flood
of
her
head
like
a
serpent
gliding
down
the
sunglade
on
a
river
why
is
it
like
that
said
hobb
simply
with
one
of
her
quick
changes
margaret
frowned
and
answered
why
is
the
black
yew
set
with
little
lamps
why
does
a
black
cloud
have
an
edge
of
light
why
does
a
blackbird
have
white
feathers
in
his
body
must
things
be
all
dark
or
all
light
and
she
stamped
her
foot
and
turned
hastily
away
and
began
to
do
up
her
hair
with
trembling
hands
and
hobb
came
behind
her
and
kissed
the
top
of
her
head
she
turned
on
him
half
angrily
half
smiling
saying
no
for
you
do
not
like
my
black
lock
and
hobb
said
very
gravely
i
will
find
all
things
beautiful
in
my
beloved
from
her
black
lock
to
her
blacker
temper
margaret
shot
a
swift
look
at
him
and
saw
that
he
was
laughing
at
her
with
an
echo
of
her
own
words
and
she
flung
her
arms
about
him
laughing
too
oh
hobb
said
she
you
pluck
out
my
black
temper
by
the
roots
so
with
teasing
and
talking
and
quarreling
and
kissing
and
love
july
came
near
its
close
and
as
love
discovers
or
creates
all
miracles
in
what
it
loves
hobb
for
pure
joy
grew
light
of
spirit
and
laughed
and
played
with
his
beloved
till
she
knew
not
whether
she
had
given
her
heart
to
a
child
or
a
man
and
again
when
the
happiness
that
was
in
his
soul
shone
through
his
eyes
he
was
so
transfigured
that
gazing
on
his
beauty
she
knew
not
whether
she
had
received
the
heart
of
a
man
or
a
god
and
the
truth
was
that
at
this
time
hobb
was
all
three
since
love
dear
maidens
commands
a
region
that
extends
beyond
birth
and
death
and
includes
all
that
is
mortal
in
all
that
is
eternal
and
as
for
margaret
she
was
all
things
by
turns
sometimes
as
gay
as
sunbeams
so
that
hobb
could
scarcely
follow
her
dancing
spirit
but
could
only
sun
himself
in
the
delight
of
it
and
sometimes
she
was
full
of
folly
and
daring
and
made
him
climb
with
her
the
highest
trees
and
drop
great
distances
from
bough
to
bough
mocking
at
all
his
fears
for
her
though
he
had
none
for
himself
and
sometimes
when
he
was
downcast
as
happened
now
and
then
for
thinking
on
his
brothers
she
forgot
her
jealousy
in
tenderness
of
his
sorrow
and
made
him
lean
his
head
upon
her
breast
and
talked
to
him
low
as
a
mother
to
her
baby
words
that
perhaps
were
only
words
of
comfort
yet
seemed
to
him
infinite
wisdom
as
the
child
believes
of
its
tender
speech
and
at
all
times
she
was
lovelier
than
his
dreams
of
her
not
once
in
this
month
did
hobb
go
out
of
the
forest
which
was
confined
on
the
north
and
by
big
roads
running
to
the
world
and
on
all
other
sides
by
sloped
of
downland
but
whenever
in
their
wanderings
they
arrived
at
any
of
these
boundaries
margaret
turned
him
back
and
said
i
do
not
love
the
open
come
away
but
on
the
last
day
of
the
month
they
came
upon
a
very
narrow
neck
of
the
treeless
down
a
green
ride
carved
between
their
wood
and
a
dark
plantation
that
lay
beyond
so
close
as
to
be
almost
a
part
of
open
winkins
but
for
that
one
little
channel
of
space
and
hobb
pointed
to
it
and
said
that
a
strange
place
let
us
go
there
no
said
margaret
but
is
it
not
our
own
wood
how
can
you
think
so
she
said
petulantly
do
you
not
see
how
black
it
is
in
there
how
can
you
want
to
go
there
come
away
what
is
it
called
asked
hobb
the
red
copse
said
she
why
asked
hobb
i
do
know
said
she
have
you
never
been
there
asked
hobb
no
never
i
do
like
it
it
frightens
me
and
she
clung
to
him
like
a
child
oh
come
away
she
was
trembling
so
that
he
turned
instantly
and
they
went
back
to
the
pilleygreen
lodges
getting
wild
raspberries
for
supper
on
the
way
and
after
supper
they
sang
songs
one
against
the
other
each
sweeter
than
the
last
and
told
stories
by
turns
outdoing
each
other
in
fancy
and
invention
and
at
last
went
happily
to
bed
but
hobb
could
not
sleep
for
in
the
night
a
wind
came
up
and
blew
four
times
round
his
lodge
shaking
it
once
on
every
wall
and
it
stirred
in
him
the
memory
of
high
and
over
and
with
the
memory
misgivings
that
he
could
not
name
and
he
rose
restlessly
from
his
couch
and
went
out
under
the
troubled
moon
for
a
windy
rack
of
clouds
was
blowing
over
the
sky
but
through
it
she
often
poured
her
amber
light
and
by
it
hobb
saw
that
margaret
door
was
blowing
on
its
hinges
he
called
her
softly
but
he
got
no
answer
and
then
he
called
more
loudly
but
still
she
did
not
answer
she
can
not
be
sleeping
through
this
said
hobb
to
himself
and
with
an
uneasy
heart
he
stood
beside
the
door
and
looked
into
the
lodge
and
she
was
not
there
and
the
couch
had
not
been
slept
on
but
on
it
lay
her
empty
dress
its
gold
and
black
all
tumbled
in
a
heap
and
on
top
of
it
was
an
embroidered
smock
and
something
in
the
smock
attracted
him
so
that
he
went
quickly
forward
to
examine
it
and
he
saw
that
it
was
heriot
shirt
that
had
been
cut
and
changed
and
worked
all
over
with
peacocks
feathers
and
he
stood
staring
at
it
astounded
and
aghast
recovering
himself
he
turned
to
leave
the
lodge
but
stumbled
on
the
open
coffer
hanging
out
of
which
was
a
second
smock
and
this
one
had
two
lions
worked
on
the
back
and
front
and
one
was
red
and
the
other
white
and
the
smock
had
been
hugh
shirt
then
hobb
fell
on
the
coffer
and
searched
its
contents
till
he
had
found
lionel
little
shirt
fashioned
into
a
linen
vest
with
a
tiny
border
of
fantastic
animals
dancing
round
it
pink
pigs
and
black
cocks
and
white
donkeys
and
chestnut
horses
and
last
of
all
he
found
the
shirt
of
ambrose
tattered
and
frayed
and
every
tatter
was
worked
at
the
edge
with
a
different
hue
and
here
and
there
small
mocking
patches
of
color
had
been
stitched
above
the
holes
and
at
each
discovery
the
light
in
hobb
eyes
grew
calmer
and
the
beat
of
his
heart
more
steady
and
he
walked
out
of
the
pilleygreen
lodge
and
as
straight
as
his
feet
would
carry
him
across
open
winkins
and
the
green
ride
and
into
the
red
copse
as
he
went
he
shut
down
the
dread
in
his
heart
of
what
he
should
find
there
for
said
hobb
to
himself
i
shall
need
more
courage
now
than
i
have
ever
had
it
was
black
in
the
red
copse
with
a
blackness
blacker
than
night
and
the
wild
races
of
moonlight
that
splashed
the
floors
of
open
winkins
were
here
unseen
but
a
line
of
ruddy
fireflies
made
a
track
on
the
blackness
and
hobb
going
as
softly
as
he
might
followed
in
their
wake
just
before
the
middle
of
the
copse
they
stopped
and
flew
away
and
one
by
one
as
each
reached
the
point
deserted
by
its
leader
darted
back
as
though
unable
to
penetrate
with
its
tiny
fire
the
fearful
shadows
that
lay
just
ahead
but
hobb
went
where
the
fireflies
could
not
go
and
he
found
a
dark
silent
hollow
in
the
wood
where
neither
moon
nor
sun
could
ever
come
and
at
the
bottom
of
it
a
long
straggling
pool
with
a
surface
as
black
as
ebony
and
mud
and
slime
below
here
toads
and
bats
and
owls
and
nightjars
had
come
to
drink
with
rats
and
stoats
who
left
their
footprints
in
the
mud
and
on
the
ground
and
bushes
hobb
saw
slugs
and
snails
woodlice
beetles
and
spiders
and
creeping
things
without
number
the
gloom
of
the
place
was
awful
and
turned
the
rank
foliage
of
trees
and
shrubs
black
in
perpetual
twilight
but
what
hobb
saw
he
saw
by
a
light
that
had
no
place
in
heaven
for
kneeling
beside
the
pool
was
his
love
margaret
her
naked
body
crouched
and
bowed
among
the
creatures
of
the
mud
and
her
two
waves
of
gold
were
flung
behind
her
like
a
smooth
mantle
but
the
one
black
lock
was
drawn
forward
over
her
head
and
she
was
dipping
and
dipping
it
into
the
dank
waters
and
every
time
she
drew
the
dripping
lock
from
its
stagnant
bath
it
glimmered
with
an
unearthly
phosphorescence
that
shed
a
ghostly
light
upon
the
hollow
and
all
that
it
contained
and
at
each
dipping
the
lock
of
hair
came
out
blacker
than
before
at
last
she
was
done
and
she
slowly
squeezed
the
water
from
her
unnatural
tress
and
laid
it
back
in
its
place
among
the
gold
and
then
she
stretched
her
arms
and
sighed
so
heavily
that
the
crawling
creatures
by
the
pool
were
startled
but
less
started
than
she
when
lifting
her
head
she
saw
the
eyes
of
hobb
looking
down
on
her
and
such
terror
came
into
her
own
eyes
that
the
look
rang
on
his
heart
as
though
it
had
been
a
cry
yet
not
a
sound
issued
between
her
lips
and
he
said
to
himself
now
i
need
more
wisdom
than
i
have
ever
had
and
he
continued
to
look
steadily
at
her
with
eyes
that
she
could
not
read
and
presently
he
spoke
we
have
some
promises
to
redeem
he
said
and
we
will
redeem
them
now
you
promised
me
my
perfect
golden
rose
and
this
night
i
am
going
out
of
open
winkins
and
back
to
my
own
burgh
and
since
i
now
know
something
of
your
power
of
gifts
i
shall
find
the
rose
upon
my
hill
and
in
exchange
for
it
i
will
keep
my
word
and
give
you
back
yourself
but
there
is
something
more
than
this
and
he
went
a
little
apart
and
soon
came
back
to
her
with
his
jerkin
undone
and
his
shirt
in
his
hand
you
have
my
brothers
shirts
and
here
is
mine
he
said
when
i
am
gone
you
shall
return
to
open
winkins
and
spend
the
hours
in
taking
out
the
work
you
have
put
into
their
shirts
and
in
the
morning
when
i
meet
them
at
the
burgh
i
shall
know
if
you
have
done
this
but
in
exchange
for
theirs
i
give
you
mine
to
do
with
as
you
will
and
the
only
other
thing
i
ask
of
you
is
this
that
when
you
have
taken
out
the
work
in
their
shirts
you
will
spend
the
day
in
making
a
white
garment
for
the
lady
who
will
one
day
be
my
wife
and
whatever
other
embroidery
you
put
upon
it
let
it
bear
on
the
left
breast
a
golden
rose
and
night
if
all
is
well
at
the
burgh
i
will
come
here
for
the
last
time
and
fetch
it
from
you
then
hobb
laid
his
shirt
beside
her
on
the
ground
and
turned
and
went
away
and
she
had
not
even
tried
to
speak
to
him
when
hobb
got
out
of
the
red
copse
he
presently
found
a
road
and
followed
it
hoping
for
the
best
after
awhile
he
saw
a
tramp
asleep
in
a
ditch
and
woke
him
and
asked
him
the
way
to
the
burgh
of
the
five
lords
but
the
tramp
had
never
heard
of
it
so
then
hobb
asked
the
way
to
firle
and
the
tramp
said
that
another
matter
for
sussex
tramps
know
all
the
beacons
of
the
downs
and
he
told
him
to
go
east
which
hobb
did
walking
without
rest
through
the
night
and
dawn
and
day
here
and
there
getting
a
lift
that
helped
him
forward
and
in
his
heart
he
carried
hope
like
a
lovely
flower
but
under
it
a
quick
pain
like
a
reptile
sting
that
felt
to
him
like
death
and
he
would
not
give
way
to
the
pain
but
went
as
fast
and
as
steadily
as
he
could
and
at
last
with
strained
eyes
and
aching
feet
and
limbs
he
could
scarcely
drag
for
weariness
and
the
dust
of
many
miles
upon
his
shoes
and
clothes
he
came
to
his
own
bare
country
and
the
burgh
he
rested
heavily
on
the
gate
and
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
lionel
on
the
steps
laughing
and
playing
with
a
litter
of
young
puppies
and
the
next
was
hugh
climbing
the
castle
wall
to
get
an
arrow
that
had
lodged
in
a
high
chink
and
out
of
a
window
leaned
heriot
in
all
his
young
beauty
picking
sweet
clusters
of
the
roses
that
climbed
to
his
room
and
in
the
doorway
sat
ambrose
with
a
book
on
his
knee
but
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
gate
and
when
he
saw
hobb
standing
there
he
came
quickly
down
the
steps
calling
to
the
others
lionel
hugh
heriot
our
brother
has
come
home
and
lionel
rushed
through
the
puppies
and
hugh
dropped
bodily
from
the
wall
and
heriot
leaped
through
the
window
and
the
four
boys
clung
to
hobb
and
kissed
him
and
wrung
his
hands
and
seemed
as
they
would
fight
for
very
possession
of
him
and
hobb
with
his
arms
about
the
younger
boys
and
heriot
hand
in
his
leaned
his
forehead
on
ambrose
cheek
and
ambrose
felt
his
face
grow
wet
with
tears
then
ambrose
looked
at
him
with
apprehension
and
said
in
a
low
voice
hobb
what
have
you
lost
and
hobb
understood
him
and
he
answered
in
a
voice
as
low
my
heart
but
i
have
found
my
four
brothers
they
took
him
in
and
prepared
a
bath
and
fresh
clothes
for
him
and
a
meal
was
ready
when
he
was
refreshed
he
came
among
them
steady
and
calm
again
and
the
three
youngest
had
nothing
but
rejoicing
for
him
and
he
saw
that
all
memory
of
what
had
happened
had
been
washed
from
them
but
with
ambrose
it
was
different
for
he
who
had
had
his
very
mind
effaced
in
recovering
his
mind
remembered
all
and
after
the
meal
he
took
hobb
aside
and
said
tell
me
what
has
happened
to
you
then
hobb
said
some
things
happen
which
are
between
two
people
only
and
they
can
never
be
told
and
what
has
passed
in
this
last
month
dear
ambrose
is
only
for
her
knowledge
and
mine
but
as
to
what
is
going
to
happen
i
do
not
yet
know
after
a
moment
silence
ambrose
said
tell
me
this
at
least
has
she
given
you
a
gift
she
has
given
me
you
again
said
hobb
that
is
different
said
ambrose
she
has
given
us
ourselves
again
and
our
power
to
pursue
the
destiny
of
our
natures
but
no
man
is
another
man
destiny
and
it
was
our
error
to
barter
our
own
powers
to
another
in
exchange
for
the
small
goals
our
natures
desired
and
so
we
lost
a
treasure
for
a
trifle
for
every
man
power
is
greater
than
the
thing
he
achieves
by
it
but
what
has
she
given
you
in
exchange
for
what
she
has
taken
from
you
and
as
he
spoke
he
looked
into
gentle
eyes
and
thought
that
if
he
had
lost
his
heart
it
was
a
loss
that
had
somehow
multiplied
his
possession
of
it
what
has
she
given
you
he
said
again
i
shall
not
know
said
hobb
until
i
have
been
to
my
garden
and
i
must
go
alone
and
afterwards
ambrose
i
must
ride
away
for
another
night
and
day
but
then
i
will
return
to
the
burgh
for
ever
so
he
got
his
horse
and
went
to
the
gardener
hill
and
his
garden
was
blazing
with
flowers
like
a
joyous
welcome
but
when
he
approached
the
bush
on
which
his
heart
was
set
he
saw
a
great
gold
bloom
upon
it
that
startled
him
with
its
beauty
until
coming
closer
he
perceived
that
all
the
petals
were
rotten
at
the
heart
and
coiled
in
the
center
was
a
small
black
snake
he
plucked
the
rose
from
its
stem
and
as
he
looked
at
it
his
face
grew
bright
and
he
suddenly
laughed
aloud
for
joy
and
he
ran
out
of
the
garden
and
got
on
his
horse
and
rode
with
all
his
speed
to
open
winkins
when
he
got
there
the
moon
had
risen
over
the
pilleygreen
lodges
and
margaret
sat
at
the
door
of
her
lodge
in
the
moonlight
putting
the
last
stitches
into
her
work
but
when
she
saw
him
coming
she
broke
her
thread
and
rose
and
averted
her
head
then
hobb
dismounted
and
came
and
stood
beside
her
and
saw
that
in
some
way
she
was
changed
from
the
woman
he
knew
margaret
still
not
turning
to
him
muttered
do
not
look
at
me
please
for
i
am
ugly
and
unhappy
and
afraid
and
nearly
mad
and
here
are
your
brothers
shirts
she
gave
him
the
four
shirts
restored
to
themselves
he
took
them
silently
and
here
continued
margaret
is
her
and
hobb
took
it
from
her
and
saw
that
out
of
his
own
shirt
washed
and
bleached
she
had
made
a
lovely
garment
and
round
it
from
the
hem
upward
ran
a
climbing
briar
of
exquisite
delicacy
and
with
a
beautiful
design
of
spines
and
leaves
but
the
only
flower
upon
it
was
a
golden
rose
worked
on
the
heart
of
the
smock
in
her
own
gold
hair
and
hobb
took
it
from
her
and
again
said
nothing
then
margaret
with
a
great
cry
as
though
her
heart
were
breaking
gasped
go
go
quickly
i
have
done
what
you
wanted
go
yes
dear
said
hobb
but
you
must
come
with
me
she
turned
then
whispering
how
can
i
go
with
you
what
do
you
mean
and
she
looked
in
his
eyes
and
saw
in
them
such
infinite
compassion
and
tenderness
that
she
was
overwhelmed
and
swayed
where
she
stood
and
then
his
arms
which
she
had
never
expected
to
feel
again
closed
round
her
body
and
she
lay
helplessly
against
him
and
heard
him
say
love
margaret
you
are
my
only
love
and
you
worked
the
for
yourself
oh
margaret
did
you
think
i
had
another
love
she
looked
at
him
blankly
as
though
she
could
not
understand
and
her
face
was
full
of
wonder
and
joy
and
fright
and
she
hung
away
from
him
sobbing
no
no
no
i
can
not
i
must
not
i
am
not
good
enough
which
of
us
is
good
enough
said
hobb
so
then
we
must
all
come
to
love
for
help
and
she
cried
again
in
an
agony
no
no
no
there
is
evil
in
me
and
i
lived
alone
and
had
nothing
nothing
that
ever
lasted
for
i
was
born
on
high
and
over
in
the
crossways
of
the
winds
and
they
were
the
godfathers
of
my
birth
and
all
my
life
they
have
blown
things
to
and
from
me
and
i
tried
to
keep
what
they
blew
me
and
i
gave
their
hearts
desire
to
all
comers
and
took
in
exchange
the
best
they
could
give
me
for
i
thought
that
if
it
was
fair
for
them
to
take
it
was
fair
for
me
to
take
too
but
nothing
that
i
took
mattered
longer
than
a
week
or
a
day
or
an
hour
neither
laughter
nor
courage
nor
beauty
nor
wisdom
all
all
were
unstable
till
the
winds
blew
me
you
and
as
i
looked
at
you
lying
there
unconscious
something
i
knew
not
what
seemed
different
from
anything
i
had
ever
known
but
when
you
opened
your
eyes
i
knew
what
it
was
and
my
heart
seemed
to
fly
from
my
body
and
i
longed
as
i
had
never
longed
with
the
others
to
give
you
your
soul
desire
and
i
have
tried
and
tried
and
i
could
not
i
could
not
give
you
anything
at
all
but
every
hour
of
the
day
and
night
i
seemed
to
be
taking
from
you
and
yet
what
you
had
to
give
me
was
never
exhausted
and
the
evil
in
me
often
fought
against
you
when
i
dreaded
your
knowing
the
truth
about
me
and
would
have
lied
my
soul
away
to
keep
you
from
knowing
it
and
when
i
was
jealous
of
your
love
for
your
brothers
so
again
and
again
i
failed
when
i
should
have
thought
of
nothing
but
that
you
loved
me
as
i
loved
you
for
did
i
not
know
of
my
own
love
that
it
could
never
give
you
cause
to
be
jealous
nor
would
ever
shrink
from
any
truth
it
might
know
of
you
but
now
but
now
oh
my
heart
had
i
known
when
you
spoke
last
night
of
your
bride
that
i
was
she
i
will
never
be
she
i
was
not
good
enough
i
fought
myself
in
vain
and
she
drooped
in
his
arms
nearly
fainting
love
margaret
said
hobb
and
the
tears
ran
down
his
face
i
will
fight
for
you
yes
and
you
will
fight
for
me
and
if
you
have
sacrificed
joy
and
courage
and
beauty
and
wisdom
for
my
sake
i
will
give
them
all
to
you
again
and
yet
you
must
also
give
them
to
me
for
they
are
things
in
which
without
you
i
am
wanting
but
together
we
can
make
them
and
when
i
went
to
my
garden
this
morning
i
thanked
god
that
my
rose
was
not
perfect
and
that
you
had
not
taken
my
heart
as
you
had
taken
joy
and
courage
and
beauty
and
wisdom
as
a
penalty
for
a
gift
their
desires
you
could
give
them
and
take
their
best
in
payment
but
mine
you
could
not
give
me
in
the
same
way
for
in
love
there
are
no
penalties
and
no
payments
and
what
is
given
is
indistinguishable
from
what
is
received
and
he
bent
his
head
and
kissed
her
long
and
deeply
and
in
that
kiss
neither
knew
themselves
or
even
each
other
but
something
beyond
all
consciousness
that
was
both
of
them
presently
hobb
said
now
let
us
go
away
from
open
winkins
together
and
i
will
take
you
to
the
burgh
but
you
must
go
as
my
bride
and
margaret
pale
as
death
from
that
long
kiss
withdrew
herself
very
slowly
from
his
arms
and
her
dark
eyes
looked
strange
in
the
moonlight
as
he
had
never
seen
them
and
more
beautiful
with
a
beauty
beyond
beauty
and
deep
joy
too
was
in
them
and
an
infinite
wisdom
and
a
strength
of
courage
that
seemed
more
than
courage
wisdom
and
joy
for
they
had
come
from
the
very
fountain
of
all
these
things
and
very
slowly
with
that
unfading
look
she
took
off
her
black
gown
and
put
on
the
white
she
had
made
and
as
soon
as
she
had
put
it
on
she
fell
dead
at
his
feet
i
think
said
martin
pippin
that
you
have
now
had
plenty
of
time
mistress
jessica
to
ponder
my
riddle
your
riddle
exclaimed
jessica
but
good
heavens
bother
your
riddle
get
on
with
the
story
how
can
i
get
on
with
it
said
martin
it
got
there
joscelyn
no
no
no
oh
it
impossible
oh
i
ca
bear
it
oh
how
angry
i
am
with
you
martin
dear
mistress
joscelyn
why
are
you
so
agitated
joscelyn
i
i
am
not
at
all
agitated
i
am
quite
collected
i
only
wish
you
were
as
collected
for
i
think
you
must
be
out
of
your
wits
how
dare
you
leave
this
story
where
it
is
how
dare
you
martin
dear
dear
mistress
joscelyn
what
more
is
there
to
be
told
joscelyn
i
do
not
care
what
more
is
to
be
told
only
some
of
it
must
be
you
must
bring
that
girl
instantly
to
life
joyce
of
course
you
must
and
explain
why
she
died
though
she
die
jennifer
no
indeed
and
if
it
had
to
do
with
her
black
hair
you
must
pluck
it
out
by
the
roots
jessica
yes
indeed
and
you
must
do
something
about
the
horrible
pool
in
the
red
copse
for
perhaps
that
is
what
killed
her
jane
oh
it
is
too
dreadful
not
to
have
a
story
with
a
wedding
in
it
and
little
joan
leaned
out
of
her
branch
and
took
martin
hand
in
hers
and
looked
at
him
pleadingly
and
said
nothing
will
women
never
let
a
man
make
a
thing
in
his
own
way
said
martin
will
they
always
be
adding
and
changing
this
detail
and
that
for
what
a
detail
is
death
once
lovers
have
kissed
however
not
less
than
yourselves
my
silly
dears
was
hobb
overwhelmed
by
that
of
his
love
margaret
and
he
fell
on
his
knees
beside
her
and
took
her
in
his
arms
and
put
his
hand
over
the
rose
on
her
heart
that
had
ceased
to
beat
suddenly
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
hand
had
been
stung
and
he
drew
it
away
quickly
his
eyes
on
the
golden
rose
and
where
she
had
left
it
just
incomplete
at
his
coming
he
saw
a
speck
a
light
broke
over
him
swiftly
and
one
by
one
he
broke
the
strands
at
the
rose
heart
and
under
it
revealed
a
small
black
snake
and
as
the
rose
had
been
done
from
her
own
gold
locks
so
the
snake
had
been
done
from
the
one
black
lock
in
the
gold
then
at
last
hobb
understood
why
she
had
cried
she
was
not
good
enough
to
be
his
bride
for
she
had
fought
in
vain
her
last
dark
impulse
to
prepare
death
for
the
woman
who
should
wear
the
and
he
understood
too
the
meaning
of
her
last
wonderful
look
as
she
took
the
death
upon
herself
and
he
loved
her
both
for
her
fault
and
her
redemption
of
it
more
than
he
had
ever
thought
that
he
could
love
her
for
he
had
believed
that
in
their
kiss
love
had
reached
its
uttermost
but
love
has
no
uttermost
as
the
stars
have
no
number
and
the
sea
no
rest
now
at
first
hobb
thought
to
pluck
the
serpent
from
her
breast
but
then
he
said
of
what
use
to
destroy
the
children
of
evil
it
is
evil
itself
we
must
destroy
at
the
roots
and
very
carefully
he
undid
her
beautiful
hair
and
laid
its
two
gold
waves
on
either
side
but
the
slim
black
tress
he
gathered
up
in
his
hand
until
he
held
every
hair
of
it
and
one
by
one
he
plucked
them
from
her
head
and
every
time
he
plucked
a
hair
the
pain
that
had
been
under
his
heart
stabbed
him
with
a
sting
that
seemed
like
death
and
with
each
sting
the
mortal
agony
grew
more
acute
till
it
was
as
though
the
powers
of
evil
were
spitting
burning
venom
on
that
steadfast
heart
to
wither
it
before
it
could
frustrate
them
but
he
did
not
falter
once
and
as
he
plucked
the
last
hair
out
margaret
opened
her
eyes
then
all
pain
leapt
like
a
winged
snake
from
his
heart
and
he
forgot
everything
but
the
joy
and
wonder
in
her
eyes
as
she
lay
looking
up
at
him
and
said
what
has
happened
to
me
and
what
have
you
done
and
she
saw
the
tress
in
his
hand
and
understood
and
she
kissed
the
hand
that
had
plucked
the
evil
from
her
then
her
smoky
eyes
shining
with
tears
but
a
smile
on
her
pale
lips
she
said
come
and
we
will
drown
that
hair
for
ever
so
they
went
across
open
winkins
and
over
the
way
that
led
to
the
red
copse
and
as
they
pushed
and
scrambled
through
the
bushes
what
do
you
think
they
saw
first
a
shimmering
light
round
the
edge
of
the
pool
and
then
a
sheet
of
the
largest
whitest
purest
blooms
that
ever
were
and
they
stood
there
on
their
tall
straight
stems
of
tender
green
in
hundreds
and
hundreds
guarding
and
sanctifying
the
place
it
was
like
a
dark
cathedral
with
white
lilies
on
the
high
altar
and
they
saw
a
cock
blackbird
wetting
his
whistle
at
the
pool
and
heard
two
others
and
a
green
woodpecker
chuckling
in
the
trees
close
by
and
they
had
no
eyes
for
slimy
goblin
things
even
if
there
were
any
and
i
do
believe
there
were
they
bound
the
black
tress
about
a
stone
and
it
sank
among
the
reflections
of
the
daisies
in
the
water
there
to
be
purified
for
ever
and
the
next
day
he
put
her
behind
him
on
his
horse
and
they
rode
to
the
garden
on
the
eastern
hills
and
found
on
his
bush
a
single
perfect
rose
and
as
she
had
given
it
to
him
hobb
straightway
plucked
and
gave
it
to
her
for
that
is
the
only
way
to
possess
a
gift
and
then
they
went
together
to
the
burgh
and
very
soon
after
there
was
a
wedding
i
am
now
all
impatience
mistress
jessica
to
hear
you
solve
my
riddle
fourth
interlude
like
contented
mice
the
milkmaids
began
once
more
to
nibble
at
their
apples
and
simultaneously
nibbled
at
the
story
jessica
do
pray
jane
let
us
hear
what
conclusions
you
draw
from
all
this
jane
i
confess
jessica
i
am
all
at
sea
the
good
and
the
evil
were
so
confused
in
this
tale
that
even
now
i
can
scarcely
distinguish
between
black
and
gold
for
had
margaret
not
done
ill
who
would
have
discovered
how
well
hobb
could
do
yet
who
would
wish
her
or
any
woman
to
do
ill
even
for
the
proof
of
his
or
any
man
good
martin
true
mistress
jane
yet
women
are
so
strangely
constructed
that
they
have
in
them
darkness
as
well
as
light
though
it
be
but
a
little
curtain
hung
across
the
sun
and
love
is
the
hand
that
takes
the
curtain
down
a
stronger
hand
than
fear
which
hung
it
up
for
all
the
ill
that
is
in
us
comes
from
fear
and
all
the
good
from
love
and
where
there
is
fear
to
combat
love
is
life
warrior
but
where
there
is
no
fear
he
is
life
priest
and
his
prayer
is
even
stronger
than
his
sword
but
men
always
less
aware
of
prayers
than
of
blows
recognize
him
chiefly
when
he
is
in
arms
and
so
are
deluded
into
thinking
that
love
depends
on
fear
to
prove
his
force
but
this
is
a
fallacy
love
force
is
independent
for
how
can
what
is
immortal
depend
on
what
is
mortal
yet
human
beings
must
by
the
very
fact
of
being
alive
at
all
partake
of
both
qualities
and
strongly
opposed
as
we
shall
find
the
complexing
elements
of
light
and
darkness
in
a
woman
still
more
strongly
opposed
shall
we
discover
them
in
a
man
as
i
presume
i
have
no
need
to
tell
you
joscelyn
you
presume
too
much
the
elements
that
go
to
make
a
man
are
not
to
our
taste
martin
my
story
i
hope
was
so
joscelyn
to
some
extent
and
this
pool
in
the
red
copse
is
it
hard
to
find
martin
neither
harder
nor
easier
than
all
fairies
secrets
and
at
certain
times
in
summer
when
the
wood
is
altogether
lovely
with
centaury
and
purple
loosestrife
you
can
hardly
miss
the
pool
for
the
fairies
that
flock
there
joyce
what
dresses
do
they
wear
martin
the
most
beautiful
in
the
world
the
dresses
of
white
admirals
and
red
and
fritillaries
and
fritillaries
and
large
whites
and
small
whites
and
marbled
whites
and
whites
and
ringlets
and
azure
blues
and
painted
ladies
and
meadow
browns
and
they
go
there
for
a
feast
day
in
honor
of
some
saint
of
the
fairies
church
which
hobb
and
margaret
also
attended
once
yearly
on
each
first
of
august
bringing
a
golden
rose
to
lay
upon
the
altars
of
the
pool
and
the
year
in
which
they
brought
it
no
more
two
sulphurs
with
dresses
like
sunlight
on
a
came
with
the
rest
to
the
feast
because
not
once
in
all
their
years
of
marriage
had
the
perfect
rose
been
lacking
jessica
it
relieves
me
to
hear
that
for
i
had
dreaded
lest
their
rose
was
blighted
for
ever
jane
and
i
too
jessica
especially
when
she
died
at
his
feet
joan
and
yet
jane
she
did
not
really
die
and
somehow
i
was
sure
she
would
live
joyce
yes
i
was
confident
that
hobb
would
be
as
happy
as
he
deserved
to
be
jennifer
i
do
not
know
why
but
even
at
the
worst
i
could
not
imagine
a
ending
in
tears
martin
neither
could
i
since
love
spear
is
for
woe
and
his
shield
for
joy
why
i
know
of
but
one
thing
that
could
have
lost
him
that
battle
three
of
the
milkmaids
what
thing
martin
had
the
elements
that
go
to
make
a
man
not
been
to
taste
conversation
ceased
in
the
joscelyn
her
taste
would
have
been
the
more
commendable
singer
and
your
tale
might
have
been
the
better
worth
listening
to
but
since
tales
have
nothing
in
common
with
truth
it
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
whether
hobb
rose
suffered
perpetual
blight
or
not
jane
and
to
me
martin
then
let
the
tale
wilt
since
indifference
is
a
blight
no
story
can
suffer
and
live
and
see
overhead
the
moon
hangs
undecided
under
a
cloud
one
half
of
her
lovely
body
unveiled
the
other
half
draped
in
a
ghostly
garment
lit
from
within
by
the
beauties
she
still
keeps
concealed
like
a
maid
for
her
pillow
turned
motionless
on
the
brink
of
her
couch
by
the
oncoming
dreams
to
which
she
so
soon
will
wholly
yield
herself
let
us
not
linger
for
her
chamber
is
sacred
and
we
too
have
dreams
that
await
our
like
a
flock
of
clouds
at
sundown
the
milkmaids
made
a
golden
group
upon
the
grass
and
soon
by
their
breathing
had
sunk
into
their
slumbers
all
but
jessica
who
instead
of
following
their
example
pushed
the
ground
with
her
foot
to
keep
herself
in
motion
and
as
she
swung
she
bit
a
strand
of
her
hair
and
knitted
her
brows
and
martin
amused
himself
watching
her
and
presently
as
she
swung
she
plucked
a
leaf
from
the
and
looked
at
it
and
let
it
go
and
then
she
snapped
off
a
twig
and
flung
it
after
the
leaf
and
next
she
caught
at
an
apple
and
tossed
it
after
the
twig
well
said
martin
pippin
do
be
in
such
a
hurry
said
jessica
she
got
off
the
swing
and
walked
round
the
tree
touching
it
here
and
there
and
all
of
a
sudden
she
threw
an
arm
up
into
the
branches
and
leaned
the
whole
weight
of
her
body
against
the
trunk
and
began
to
whistle
give
it
up
said
martin
pippin
stupid
said
jessica
i
guessed
it
impossible
said
martin
nobody
ever
guesses
riddles
riddles
were
only
invented
to
be
given
up
because
the
pleasure
of
not
being
guessed
is
so
much
greater
than
the
pleasure
of
having
guessed
do
give
it
up
and
let
me
tell
you
the
answer
even
if
you
know
the
answer
please
please
give
it
up
for
i
am
dying
to
tell
it
you
i
shall
never
have
saved
a
young
man
life
easier
said
jessica
and
as
you
saved
mine
before
the
story
i
suppose
i
ought
to
save
yours
after
it
how
often
by
the
way
have
you
saved
a
lady
life
as
often
as
she
thought
herself
in
danger
of
losing
it
said
martin
it
happens
every
other
minute
with
ladies
who
are
always
dying
to
have
or
to
do
or
to
know
this
thing
or
that
i
hope
said
jessica
i
shall
not
die
before
i
know
everything
there
is
to
know
what
a
small
wish
said
martin
have
you
a
bigger
one
yes
said
he
to
know
everything
there
is
not
to
know
jessica
oh
but
those
are
the
only
things
i
do
know
martin
it
is
a
knowledge
common
to
women
jessica
how
do
you
know
martin
i
sure
i
do
know
jessica
i
do
think
master
pippin
that
you
know
a
great
deal
about
women
and
she
put
out
her
tongue
at
him
martin
take
care
i
know
nothing
at
all
about
women
jessica
why
yet
you
pretend
to
tell
martin
because
if
you
do
that
i
ca
answer
for
the
consequences
it
is
only
by
women
help
that
i
tell
them
at
all
jessica
i
not
afraid
of
consequences
i
not
afraid
of
anything
who
helped
you
tell
this
one
martin
your
courage
will
have
to
be
tested
you
did
jessica
did
i
how
martin
because
what
you
love
in
an
is
not
the
leaf
or
the
flower
or
the
bough
or
the
fruit
it
is
the
which
is
all
of
the
things
and
everything
besides
for
it
is
the
roots
and
the
rind
and
the
sap
it
is
motion
and
rest
and
color
and
shape
and
scent
and
the
shadows
on
the
earth
and
the
lights
in
the
air
and
still
i
have
not
said
what
the
tree
is
that
you
love
for
thought
i
should
recapitulate
it
through
the
four
seasons
i
should
only
be
telling
you
those
parts
none
of
which
is
what
you
love
in
an
for
no
one
can
love
the
part
more
than
the
whole
till
love
can
be
measured
in
and
who
can
measure
fountains
that
the
answer
mistress
jessica
i
knew
you
have
to
give
it
up
take
care
child
take
care
jessica
i
wo
take
care
i
knew
the
answer
all
the
time
martin
then
you
know
what
your
has
to
do
with
my
story
jessica
yes
i
suppose
so
martin
please
tell
me
jessica
no
martin
but
i
give
it
up
jessica
no
martin
that
not
fair
people
who
give
it
up
must
always
be
told
in
triumph
if
not
in
pity
jessica
i
tell
martin
you
do
know
jessica
i
box
your
ears
martin
if
you
do
jessica
quarreling
silly
martin
who
began
it
jessica
you
did
men
always
do
martin
always
what
was
the
beginning
of
your
quarrel
with
men
jessica
they
say
girls
ca
throw
straight
martin
silly
asses
i
like
to
see
them
throw
as
straight
as
girls
did
you
ever
watch
them
at
it
men
can
throw
straight
in
one
direction
only
but
watch
a
girl
she
throw
straight
all
round
the
compass
why
a
man
will
throw
straight
at
the
moon
and
miss
it
by
the
eighth
of
an
inch
but
a
girl
will
throw
at
the
sun
and
hit
the
moon
as
straight
as
a
die
i
never
saw
a
girl
throw
yet
without
straightway
finding
some
mark
or
other
jessica
yes
but
you
ca
convince
a
man
till
he
hit
martin
hit
him
then
jessica
it
did
convince
him
he
said
i
missed
and
he
said
he
had
hi
he
was
convinced
martin
did
he
really
say
that
these
men
can
no
more
talk
straight
than
throw
straight
can
you
talk
straight
jessica
jessica
yes
martin
martin
then
tell
me
what
your
has
to
do
with
my
story
jessica
bother
all
right
because
wisdom
and
beauty
and
courage
and
laughter
can
all
be
measured
in
and
any
or
all
of
these
things
can
be
dipped
out
of
a
fountain
you
thought
i
did
know
but
i
do
know
martin
take
care
where
did
you
get
all
this
knowledge
jessica
and
that
was
why
margaret
could
take
what
she
took
from
lionel
and
hugh
and
heriot
and
ambrose
because
it
was
something
measurable
yes
because
even
a
gay
spirit
can
be
sad
at
times
and
a
strong
nerve
weak
and
a
beautiful
face
ugly
and
a
clever
brain
dull
but
when
it
came
to
taking
what
hobb
had
she
could
take
and
take
without
exhausting
it
and
give
and
give
and
always
have
something
left
to
give
because
that
was
measurable
and
the
tree
is
the
tree
and
love
is
never
anything
else
but
love
martin
oh
jessica
who
has
been
your
schoolmaster
jessica
and
so
when
she
threw
away
her
four
pints
what
did
it
matter
any
more
than
when
the
tree
loses
its
leaves
or
its
flowers
or
snaps
a
twig
or
drops
its
apples
for
though
nobody
else
thought
them
lovely
or
clever
or
witty
or
splendid
she
and
hobb
were
so
to
each
other
for
ever
and
ever
because
martin
because
jessica
it
does
matter
i
told
you
enough
and
you
thought
i
could
tell
you
anything
and
i
simply
hated
saying
it
but
you
thought
i
could
throw
straight
and
i
can
and
your
riddle
was
as
simple
as
pie
martin
look
out
i
tell
you
you
have
thrown
as
straight
as
a
die
and
now
i
will
ask
you
a
straight
question
will
you
give
me
your
key
to
gillian
prison
jessica
yes
martin
because
you
dreaded
lest
hobb
rose
was
blighted
for
ever
jessica
no
because
it
a
shame
she
should
be
there
at
all
and
she
gave
him
the
key
martin
you
honest
dear
jessica
you
thought
i
was
going
to
beg
the
question
did
you
martin
martin
put
in
your
tongue
or
jessica
or
what
martin
you
know
what
jessica
i
do
know
what
martin
then
you
must
take
the
consequences
and
she
took
the
consequences
on
both
cheeks
jessica
oh
oh
if
i
had
guessed
you
meant
that
do
you
suppose
for
a
moment
that
i
would
have
martin
you
dishonest
dear
jessica
i
do
know
what
you
mean
martin
how
crooked
girls
throw
she
boxed
his
ears
heartily
and
ran
to
her
comrades
when
she
was
perfectly
safe
she
turned
round
and
put
out
her
tongue
at
him
then
they
both
lay
down
and
went
to
sleep
martin
was
wakened
by
water
squeezed
on
his
eyelids
he
looked
up
and
saw
joscelyn
wringing
out
her
little
handkerchief
in
the
pannikin
let
us
have
no
nonsense
this
morning
said
she
i
like
that
mumbled
martin
what
this
but
nonsense
he
sat
up
drying
his
face
on
his
sleeve
what
a
silly
trick
he
said
rubbish
said
joscelyn
our
master
is
due
and
yesterday
you
overslept
yourself
and
were
troublesome
go
to
your
tree
this
instant
i
shall
go
when
i
choose
said
martin
maids
maids
maids
this
instant
said
joscelyn
and
dipped
her
handkerchief
in
the
pannikin
martin
crawled
into
the
tree
is
a
dog
got
into
the
orchard
maids
said
old
gillman
looking
through
the
hedge
what
an
idea
master
said
joscelyn
i
thought
i
seed
one
wagging
his
tail
in
the
grass
the
girls
burst
out
laughing
they
laughed
till
the
apples
shook
and
old
gillman
laughed
too
because
laughter
is
catching
and
then
he
stopped
laughing
and
said
is
an
echo
got
into
the
orchard
and
the
startled
girls
laughed
louder
than
ever
and
they
grew
red
in
the
face
and
tears
stood
in
their
eyes
and
joscelyn
had
to
go
and
lean
against
the
russet
tree
where
she
stood
frowning
like
a
stepmother
tis
well
to
be
laughing
said
old
gillman
but
have
ye
heard
my
daughter
laughing
yet
no
master
said
jessica
but
i
should
wonder
if
it
happened
any
day
any
day
may
be
no
day
groaned
gillman
and
though
it
were
some
day
as
like
as
not
i
not
be
here
to
see
the
day
for
i
drinking
myself
into
my
grave
as
parson
warned
me
yesternight
coming
for
my
receipt
for
mulled
beer
gillian
he
implored
when
will
ye
think
better
of
it
and
save
an
old
man
life
but
for
all
the
notice
she
took
of
him
he
might
have
been
the
dog
barking
in
his
kennel
bitter
bread
for
me
maids
and
sweet
bread
for
you
said
the
farmer
passing
the
loaves
through
the
gap
tis
plain
fare
for
all
these
days
may
the
morrow
bring
cake
oh
master
please
called
jessica
i
would
like
to
know
how
clover
the
aberdeen
gets
on
without
me
gets
on
as
best
she
can
with
oliver
said
gillman
though
that
fretty
at
times
tis
as
well
for
him
she
polled
yet
all
he
says
is
patience
but
i
say
will
patience
keep
us
all
from
rack
and
ruin
and
he
went
away
shaking
his
head
why
did
you
laugh
stormed
joscelyn
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
earshot
how
could
i
help
it
pleaded
martin
when
the
old
man
laughed
because
you
laughed
and
you
laughed
for
another
reason
had
i
a
third
reason
to
laugh
but
how
you
glared
at
me
i
am
sorry
i
laughed
let
us
have
breakfast
you
think
of
nothing
but
mealtimes
said
joscelyn
crossly
and
she
carried
gillian
bread
to
the
where
she
discovered
only
the
little
round
top
of
yesterday
loaf
for
every
crumb
of
the
bigger
half
had
been
eaten
so
joscelyn
came
away
all
smiles
tossing
the
ball
of
bread
in
the
air
and
saying
as
she
caught
it
i
do
believe
gillian
is
forgetting
her
sorrow
i
am
certain
of
it
agreed
martin
clapping
his
hands
and
she
flung
the
top
of
the
loaf
to
his
right
and
he
made
a
great
leap
to
the
left
and
caught
it
and
then
he
threw
it
to
jessica
who
tossed
it
to
joan
who
sent
it
to
joyce
who
whirled
it
to
jennifer
who
spun
it
to
jane
who
missed
it
and
all
the
girls
ran
to
pick
it
up
first
but
martin
with
a
dexterous
kick
landed
it
in
the
duckpond
where
the
drake
got
it
and
he
and
the
ducks
squabbled
over
it
during
the
next
hour
while
martin
and
the
milkmaids
breakfasted
on
bread
and
apples
with
no
squabbling
and
great
good
spirits
and
after
breakfast
martin
lay
on
his
back
chewing
a
grassblade
and
counting
the
florets
on
another
whispering
to
himself
as
he
plucked
them
one
by
one
and
the
girls
watched
him
he
did
it
several
times
with
several
blades
of
grass
and
always
looked
disappointed
at
the
end
wo
it
come
right
asked
little
joan
wo
what
come
right
said
martin
oh
i
know
what
you
doing
said
little
joan
and
she
too
plucked
a
blade
and
began
to
count
tinker
tailor
soldier
sailor
i
sure
i
was
said
martin
tailor
indeed
well
something
like
that
said
joan
nothing
at
all
like
that
oh
mistress
joan
a
tailor
why
even
if
i
were
a
maid
like
yourselves
do
you
think
i
give
fate
the
chance
to
set
me
on
my
husband
for
the
rest
of
my
life
what
would
you
do
then
if
you
were
a
maid
asked
joyce
if
i
were
a
said
martin
i
should
choose
the
most
delightful
husbands
in
the
city
streets
and
plucking
a
fresh
blade
he
counted
aloud
singer
ringer
chimneysweep
lamplighter
king
singer
ringer
chimneysweep
there
mistress
joyce
said
martin
pippin
i
should
marry
a
sweep
and
sit
in
the
tall
chimneys
and
see
stars
by
daylight
oh
let
me
try
cried
joyce
and
let
me
cried
five
other
voices
at
once
so
he
chose
each
girl
a
blade
and
she
counted
her
fate
on
it
with
martin
to
prompt
her
and
jessica
got
the
and
vowed
she
saw
orion
belt
round
the
sun
and
jennifer
got
the
lamplighter
and
looked
sorrowful
for
she
too
wished
to
see
stars
in
the
morning
but
martin
consoled
her
by
saying
that
she
would
make
the
dark
to
shine
and
set
whispering
lights
in
the
fog
when
men
had
none
other
to
see
by
and
joyce
got
the
and
martin
told
her
that
wherever
she
went
men
women
and
children
would
run
to
their
snowy
doorsteps
for
she
would
be
as
welcome
as
swallows
in
spring
and
jane
got
the
and
martin
said
an
angel
must
have
blessed
her
birth
since
she
was
to
live
and
die
with
the
peals
of
heaven
in
her
ears
and
joscelyn
got
the
what
about
master
pippin
asked
joscelyn
nothing
at
all
about
said
martin
they
a
poor
lot
i
sorry
for
you
and
joscelyn
threw
her
stripped
blade
away
saying
it
only
a
silly
game
but
little
joan
got
the
king
and
she
looked
at
martin
and
he
smiled
at
her
and
had
no
need
to
say
anything
because
a
king
is
a
king
and
suddenly
every
girl
must
needs
grow
out
of
sorts
with
her
fate
and
find
other
blades
to
count
until
each
one
had
achieved
a
king
to
her
satisfaction
all
but
joscelyn
who
said
she
did
care
you
are
quite
right
said
martin
because
none
of
this
applies
to
any
of
you
these
are
and
you
are
and
he
plucked
a
new
blade
reciting
mower
reaper
poacher
keeper
cowman
thatcher
plowman
herd
how
dull
said
jessica
these
are
men
for
every
day
so
is
a
husband
said
martin
and
to
your
who
no
longer
see
romance
in
a
chimneysweep
your
poacher
a
pirate
and
your
shepherd
a
poet
could
you
not
find
it
in
your
heart
mistress
jessica
to
put
up
with
a
thatcher
that
enough
of
husbands
said
jessica
then
what
of
houses
said
martin
where
shall
we
live
when
wed
a
thatch
in
a
ship
hatch
an
inn
a
castle
a
brown
paper
parcel
stuff
and
nonsense
said
joscelyn
for
the
sake
of
the
rime
begged
martin
but
the
girls
were
not
interested
in
houses
yet
the
rest
of
the
morning
they
went
searching
the
orchard
for
the
grass
of
fortune
and
not
telling
but
once
martin
coming
behind
jessica
distinctly
heard
her
murmur
thatcher
and
smile
and
at
another
time
he
saw
joyce
deliberately
count
her
blade
before
beginning
and
nip
off
a
floret
and
then
begin
and
the
end
was
plowman
and
presently
little
joan
came
and
knelt
beside
him
where
he
sat
counting
on
his
own
behalf
and
said
timidly
martin
yes
dear
said
martin
absentmindedly
oh
martin
is
it
very
wicked
to
poach
the
best
men
all
do
it
said
martin
oh
please
what
are
you
counting
you
swear
you
wo
tell
said
martin
with
a
at
her
she
shook
her
head
and
he
pulled
at
his
grass
whispering
jennifer
jessica
jane
joan
joyce
joscelyn
gillian
and
the
last
one
said
little
joan
with
a
rosy
face
for
he
had
paused
at
the
eighth
sh
said
martin
and
stuck
his
blade
behind
his
ear
and
called
dinner
so
they
came
to
dinner
have
you
not
found
said
martin
that
after
thinking
all
the
morning
it
is
necessary
to
jump
all
the
afternoon
and
he
got
the
ropes
of
the
swing
and
began
to
skip
with
great
clumsiness
always
failing
before
ten
and
catching
the
cord
round
his
ankles
at
which
the
girls
plied
him
with
derision
and
said
they
would
show
him
how
and
jane
showed
him
how
to
skip
forwards
and
jessica
how
to
skip
backwards
and
jennifer
how
to
skip
with
both
feet
and
stay
in
one
spot
and
joyce
how
to
skip
on
either
foot
on
a
run
and
joscelyn
showed
him
how
to
skip
with
the
rope
crossed
and
uncrossed
by
turns
but
little
joan
showed
him
how
to
skip
so
high
and
so
lightly
that
she
could
whirl
the
rope
twice
under
her
feet
before
they
came
down
to
earth
like
birds
and
then
the
girls
took
the
ropes
by
turns
ringing
the
changes
on
all
these
ways
of
skipping
or
two
of
them
would
turn
a
rope
for
the
others
while
they
skipped
the
games
of
their
grandmothers
cross
the
bible
all
in
together
lady
lady
drop
your
purse
and
cinderella
lost
her
shoe
or
they
turned
two
ropes
at
once
for
the
double
dutch
and
martin
took
his
run
with
the
rest
and
at
first
he
did
very
badly
but
as
the
day
wore
on
improved
until
by
evening
he
was
whirling
the
rope
three
times
under
his
feet
that
glanced
against
each
other
in
like
the
knife
and
the
steel
and
the
girls
clapped
their
hands
because
they
could
help
it
and
joan
said
breathlessly
how
quick
you
are
it
took
me
ten
days
to
do
that
and
martin
answered
breathlessly
how
quick
you
were
it
took
me
ten
years
are
you
ever
honest
about
anything
master
pippin
said
joscelyn
petulantly
three
times
a
day
said
martin
i
am
honestly
hungry
so
they
had
supper
supper
done
they
clustered
as
usual
about
the
tree
and
martin
looked
inquiringly
from
jane
to
joscelyn
and
from
joscelyn
to
jane
and
joscelyn
expression
was
one
of
uncontrolled
indifference
and
jane
expression
was
one
of
bridled
excitement
so
martin
ignored
joscelyn
and
asked
jane
what
she
was
thinking
about
a
great
number
of
things
master
pippin
said
she
there
is
always
so
much
to
think
about
is
there
said
martin
oh
surely
you
know
there
is
how
could
you
tell
stories
else
i
never
think
when
i
tell
stories
said
martin
i
give
them
a
push
and
let
them
swing
oh
but
said
jane
it
is
very
dangerous
to
speak
without
thinking
one
might
say
anything
one
does
agreed
martin
and
then
anything
happens
but
people
who
think
before
speaking
often
end
by
saying
nothing
and
so
nothing
happens
perhaps
it
as
well
said
joyce
slyly
yet
the
world
must
go
round
mistress
joyce
and
swings
were
made
to
swing
do
you
think
mistress
jane
if
you
sat
in
the
swing
i
should
think
twice
or
even
once
before
giving
it
a
push
jane
considered
this
and
then
said
gravely
i
think
master
pippin
you
would
have
to
think
at
least
once
before
pushing
the
swing
because
it
is
there
what
a
wise
little
milkmaid
you
are
said
martin
looking
about
for
the
yes
said
jessica
jane
is
wiser
than
any
of
us
she
is
extremely
wise
i
wonder
you
had
noticed
it
oh
but
i
had
said
martin
earnestly
fixing
the
swinging
ropes
to
their
places
there
mistress
jane
let
me
help
you
in
and
i
will
give
you
a
push
he
offered
her
his
hand
respectfully
and
jane
took
it
saying
i
like
swinging
very
high
i
will
think
before
i
push
said
martin
and
when
she
was
settled
with
her
skirts
in
order
and
her
little
feet
tucked
back
he
rocked
the
swing
so
gently
that
not
an
apple
fell
nor
a
milkmaid
slipped
clambering
to
her
place
and
martin
leaned
back
in
his
and
shut
his
eyes
we
are
waiting
observed
joscelyn
overhead
so
am
i
sighed
martin
for
what
for
a
push
but
you
not
swinging
neither
my
story
and
it
will
take
seven
pair
of
arms
to
set
it
going
and
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
gillian
in
her
sorrow
but
she
did
not
lift
her
face
here
six
to
start
the
motion
of
themselves
said
joscelyn
and
it
only
remains
to
you
to
attract
the
seventh
it
were
easier
said
martin
to
unlock
saint
peter
gates
with
cowslips
i
was
not
talking
of
impossibilities
master
pippin
said
joscelyn
why
neither
was
i
said
martin
for
did
you
never
hear
that
cowslips
among
all
the
golden
flowers
of
spring
are
the
keys
of
heaven
and
sending
a
little
chime
from
his
lute
across
the
he
sang
she
lost
the
keys
of
heaven
walking
in
a
shadow
sighing
for
her
lad
o
she
lost
her
keys
of
heaven
she
saw
the
boys
and
girls
who
flocked
beyond
the
gates
all
barred
and
locked
and
oh
sighed
she
the
locks
are
seven
betwixt
me
and
my
lad
o
and
i
have
lost
my
keys
of
heaven
walking
in
a
shadow
she
found
the
keys
of
heaven
all
in
a
may
meadow
singing
for
her
lad
o
she
found
her
keys
of
heaven
she
found
them
made
of
cowslip
gold
springing
and
oh
sang
she
ere
fall
of
even
shall
i
not
be
wed
o
for
i
have
found
my
keys
of
heaven
all
in
a
may
meadow
by
the
end
of
the
song
gillian
was
kneeling
upright
among
the
mallows
and
with
her
hands
clasped
under
her
chin
was
gazing
across
the
duckpond
well
well
exclaimed
joscelyn
cowslips
may
or
may
not
have
the
power
to
unlock
the
heavenly
gates
but
there
no
denying
that
a
very
silly
song
has
unlocked
our
mistress
lethargy
so
i
advise
you
to
seize
the
occasion
to
swing
your
tale
on
its
way
then
here
goes
said
martin
and
i
only
pray
you
to
set
your
sympathies
also
in
motion
while
i
endeavor
to
keep
them
going
with
the
story
of
proud
rosalind
and
the
proud
rosalind
and
the
there
was
once
dear
maidens
a
who
lived
by
the
ferry
at
bury
and
nobody
knew
where
he
came
from
for
the
chief
of
his
trades
he
was
an
armorer
for
it
was
in
the
times
when
men
thought
danger
could
only
be
faced
and
honor
won
in
a
case
of
steel
not
having
learned
that
either
against
danger
or
for
honor
the
naked
heart
is
the
fittest
wear
so
this
man
whose
name
was
harding
kept
his
fires
going
for
men
needs
and
women
too
for
besides
making
and
mending
swords
and
knives
and
greaves
for
the
one
he
would
also
make
brooches
and
buckles
and
chains
for
the
other
and
tools
for
the
peasants
they
sometimes
called
him
the
red
smith
in
person
harding
was
ruddy
though
his
fairness
differed
from
the
fairness
of
the
natives
and
his
speech
was
not
wholly
their
speech
he
was
a
man
of
mighty
brawn
and
stature
his
eyes
gleamed
like
blue
ice
seen
under
a
fierce
sun
the
hair
of
his
head
and
his
beard
glittered
like
red
gold
and
the
finer
hair
on
his
great
arms
and
breast
overlaid
with
an
amber
sheen
the
of
his
skin
he
seemed
a
man
made
to
move
the
mountains
of
the
world
yet
truth
to
tell
he
was
a
most
indifferent
smith
martin
are
you
not
quite
comfortable
mistress
jane
jane
i
am
perfectly
comfortable
thank
you
master
pippin
martin
i
fancied
you
were
a
trifle
unsettled
jane
no
indeed
what
would
unsettle
me
martin
i
have
the
ghost
of
a
notion
i
have
heard
gossips
tell
but
it
has
since
been
forgotten
or
discredited
that
this
part
of
the
river
was
then
known
as
ferry
for
this
it
was
said
was
one
of
the
several
places
in
england
where
the
spirit
lurked
of
wayland
the
smith
who
was
the
cunningest
worker
in
metal
ever
told
of
in
song
or
story
and
he
had
come
overseas
from
the
north
where
men
worshiped
him
as
a
god
no
one
in
bury
had
ever
seen
the
shape
of
wayland
but
all
believed
in
him
devoutly
for
this
was
told
of
him
and
truly
that
any
one
coming
to
the
ferry
with
an
unshod
steed
had
only
to
lay
a
penny
on
the
ground
and
cry
aloud
wayland
smith
shoe
me
my
horse
and
so
withdraw
and
on
coming
again
he
would
find
his
horse
shod
with
a
craft
unknown
to
human
hands
and
his
penny
gone
and
nobody
thought
of
attributing
to
harding
the
work
of
wayland
partly
because
no
human
smith
would
have
worked
for
so
mean
a
fee
as
was
accepted
by
the
god
and
chiefly
because
the
quality
of
the
workmanship
of
the
man
and
the
god
was
as
dissimilar
as
that
of
clay
and
gold
besides
his
trade
in
metal
harding
also
plied
the
ferry
and
then
men
would
speak
of
him
as
the
red
boatman
but
he
could
not
be
depended
on
for
he
was
often
absent
his
boat
was
of
a
curious
shape
not
like
any
other
boat
seen
on
the
arun
its
prow
was
curved
like
a
bird
beak
and
when
folk
wished
to
go
across
to
the
amberley
flats
that
lie
under
the
splendid
shell
which
was
once
a
castle
harding
would
carry
them
if
he
was
there
and
neither
too
busy
nor
too
surly
and
when
they
asked
the
fee
he
always
said
when
i
work
in
metal
i
take
metal
but
for
that
which
flows
i
take
only
that
which
flows
so
give
me
whatever
you
have
heart
to
give
as
long
as
it
is
not
coin
and
they
gave
him
willingly
anything
they
had
a
flower
or
an
egg
or
a
bird
feather
a
child
once
gave
him
her
curl
and
a
man
his
hand
and
when
he
was
neither
in
his
workshop
or
his
boat
he
hunted
on
the
hills
but
this
was
a
trade
he
put
to
no
man
service
harding
hunted
only
for
himself
and
because
he
served
his
own
pleasure
more
passionately
than
he
served
others
and
was
oftener
seen
with
his
bow
than
with
hammer
or
oar
he
was
chiefly
known
as
the
red
hunter
often
in
the
late
of
the
year
he
would
be
away
on
the
great
hills
of
bury
and
bignor
and
houghton
and
rewell
with
their
burning
on
their
sides
and
in
their
hollows
and
their
rolling
shoulders
lifted
out
of
those
autumn
fires
to
meet
in
freedom
the
freedom
of
the
clouds
it
was
on
one
of
his
huntings
he
came
on
the
this
pool
had
for
long
been
a
legend
in
the
neighborhood
and
it
was
said
that
whoever
had
courage
to
seek
it
in
the
hour
before
midnight
on
midsummer
eve
and
thrice
utter
her
wish
aloud
would
surely
have
that
wish
granted
within
the
year
but
with
time
it
had
become
a
lost
secret
perhaps
because
its
ancient
reputation
as
the
haunt
of
goblin
things
had
long
since
sapped
the
courage
of
the
maidens
of
those
parts
and
only
remembered
how
that
once
their
grandmothers
had
tried
their
fortunes
there
and
its
whereabouts
had
been
forgotten
but
one
september
harding
saw
a
on
great
down
there
were
wild
deer
on
the
hills
then
but
such
a
calf
he
had
never
seen
before
so
he
stalked
it
over
madehurst
and
rewell
and
followed
it
into
the
thick
of
rewell
wood
and
when
it
led
him
to
its
he
knew
that
he
had
discovered
one
more
secret
of
the
hills
and
that
this
somber
mere
wherein
strange
waters
bubbled
in
whispers
could
be
no
other
than
the
lost
the
young
calf
might
have
been
its
magic
guard
to
harding
it
was
a
discovery
more
precious
than
the
mere
for
all
that
it
was
of
the
first
year
with
its
prickets
only
showing
where
its
antlers
would
branch
in
time
it
was
of
a
breed
so
fine
and
a
build
so
noble
that
its
matchless
noon
could
already
be
foretold
from
its
matchless
dawn
and
added
to
all
its
strength
and
grace
and
beauty
was
this
last
marvel
that
though
it
was
of
the
tribe
of
the
red
deer
its
skin
was
as
white
and
speckless
as
falling
snow
watching
it
the
red
smith
said
to
himself
not
yet
my
quarry
you
are
of
king
stock
and
if
after
the
sixth
year
you
show
twelve
points
you
shall
be
for
me
but
first
my
you
shall
get
your
growth
and
he
came
away
and
told
no
man
of
the
calf
or
of
the
pool
and
in
the
second
year
he
watched
for
it
by
the
mere
and
saw
it
come
to
drink
no
longer
a
calf
but
a
lovely
brocket
with
its
brow
antlers
making
its
first
two
points
and
in
the
third
year
he
watched
for
it
again
no
brocket
now
but
a
splendid
spayade
which
to
its
brows
had
added
its
shooting
bays
and
in
the
fourth
year
the
spayade
had
become
a
proud
young
staggarde
with
its
trays
above
its
bays
and
in
the
fifth
year
the
staggarde
was
a
stag
crowned
with
the
exquisite
twin
crowns
of
its
crockets
surmounting
tray
and
bay
and
brow
and
harding
lying
hidden
gloried
in
it
thinking
all
your
points
now
but
two
my
quarry
and
next
year
you
shall
add
the
beam
to
the
crown
and
i
will
hunt
my
hart
now
at
the
time
when
harding
first
saw
the
calf
and
the
ruin
of
the
castle
across
the
ferry
was
only
a
ruin
not
fit
for
habitation
it
was
nevertheless
inhabited
by
the
proud
rosalind
who
dwelt
there
without
kith
or
kin
and
if
time
had
crumbled
the
castle
to
its
last
nobility
so
that
all
that
was
strong
and
beautiful
in
it
was
preserved
and
as
it
were
exposed
in
nakedness
to
the
eyes
of
men
so
in
her
who
was
the
ruins
of
her
family
was
preserved
and
exposed
all
that
had
been
most
noble
strong
and
beautiful
in
her
race
she
was
as
poor
as
she
was
friendless
but
her
pride
outmatched
both
these
things
so
great
was
her
pride
that
she
learned
to
endure
shame
for
the
sake
of
it
she
had
a
tall
straight
figure
that
was
both
strong
and
graceful
and
she
carried
herself
like
a
tree
her
hair
was
neither
bronze
nor
gold
nor
copper
yet
seemed
to
be
an
alloy
of
all
the
precious
mines
of
the
turning
year
the
vigorous
dusky
gold
of
november
elms
the
rust
of
dead
bracken
made
living
by
heavy
rains
the
color
of
beechmast
drenched
with
sunlight
after
frost
and
all
the
layers
of
glory
on
the
boughs
before
it
fell
when
it
needed
neither
sun
nor
dew
to
make
it
glow
all
these
could
be
seen
in
different
lights
upon
her
heavy
hair
which
when
unbound
hung
as
low
as
her
knees
her
thick
brows
were
dark
gold
and
her
fearless
eyes
dark
gray
with
gold
gleams
in
them
they
may
have
been
reflections
from
her
lashes
or
even
from
her
skin
which
had
upon
it
the
bloom
of
a
golden
plum
dim
ages
since
her
fathers
had
been
kings
in
sussex
gradually
their
estate
had
diminished
but
with
the
lessening
of
their
worldly
possessions
they
burnished
the
brighter
the
possession
of
their
honor
and
bred
the
care
of
it
in
their
children
jealously
so
it
came
to
pass
that
rosalind
who
possessed
less
than
any
serf
or
yeoman
in
the
countryside
trod
among
these
as
though
she
were
a
queen
dreaming
of
a
degree
which
she
had
never
known
ignored
or
shrugged
at
by
those
whom
she
accounted
her
equals
insulted
or
gibed
at
by
those
she
thought
her
inferiors
for
the
dwellers
in
the
neighboring
hamlets
to
whom
the
story
of
her
fathers
was
only
a
legend
saw
in
her
just
a
shabby
girl
less
worthy
than
themselves
because
much
poorer
whose
pride
and
very
beauty
aroused
their
mockery
and
wrath
they
did
not
dispute
her
possession
of
the
castle
for
what
to
them
were
four
vast
roofless
walls
enclosing
a
square
of
greensward
underfoot
and
another
of
blue
air
overhead
and
pierced
with
doorless
doorways
and
windowless
casements
that
let
in
all
the
lights
of
all
the
quarters
of
the
sky
what
to
them
were
these
traces
of
old
chambers
etched
on
the
surface
of
the
old
gray
stone
these
fragments
of
lovely
arches
that
were
but
channels
for
the
winds
in
the
thick
of
the
great
towered
gateway
one
little
room
remained
above
the
arch
and
here
the
maiden
slept
and
all
her
company
was
the
ghosts
of
her
race
she
saw
them
feasting
in
the
halls
of
the
air
and
moving
on
the
courtyard
of
the
grass
at
night
in
the
galleries
of
the
stars
she
heard
their
singing
and
often
looking
through
the
empty
windows
over
the
flats
to
which
the
great
west
wall
dropped
down
she
saw
them
ride
in
cavalcade
out
of
the
sunset
from
battle
or
hunt
or
tourney
but
the
peasants
who
did
not
know
what
she
saw
and
heard
preferred
their
snug
squalor
to
this
shivering
nobility
and
despised
the
girl
who
in
a
fallen
fortress
defended
her
life
from
theirs
at
first
she
had
kept
her
distance
with
a
kind
of
graciousness
but
one
day
in
her
sixteenth
year
a
certain
boor
met
her
under
the
castle
wall
as
she
was
returning
with
sticks
for
kindling
and
was
struck
by
her
free
and
noble
carriage
for
though
she
was
little
more
than
a
child
through
all
her
rags
she
shone
with
the
grace
and
splendor
not
only
of
her
race
but
of
the
wild
life
she
lived
on
the
hills
when
she
was
not
in
her
ruins
she
was
as
strong
and
fine
as
a
young
hind
and
could
run
like
any
deer
upon
the
downs
and
climb
like
any
squirrel
and
the
peasant
seeing
as
though
for
the
first
time
her
untamed
beauty
on
an
impulse
offered
to
kiss
her
and
make
her
his
woman
rosalind
stared
at
him
like
one
aroused
from
sleep
with
a
rude
blow
the
color
flamed
in
her
cheek
you
to
accost
so
one
of
my
blood
she
cried
mongrel
go
back
to
your
kennel
the
lout
gaped
between
rage
and
mortification
and
muttering
made
a
step
towards
her
but
suddenly
seeming
to
think
better
of
it
stumbled
away
then
rosalind
lifting
her
glowing
face
as
beautiful
as
sunset
with
its
double
flush
rose
under
gold
saw
harding
the
red
hunter
gazing
at
her
some
business
had
brought
him
over
the
ferry
and
on
his
road
he
had
lit
upon
the
suit
and
its
rejection
rosalind
her
spirit
chafed
with
what
had
passed
returned
his
gaze
haughtily
but
he
maintained
his
steadfast
look
as
though
he
had
been
hewn
out
of
stone
and
presently
impatient
and
disdainful
she
turned
away
then
and
instantly
harding
pursued
his
way
in
silence
and
rosalind
grew
somehow
aware
that
he
had
determined
to
stand
at
gaze
until
her
eyes
were
lowered
thereupon
she
classed
his
presumption
with
that
of
the
other
who
had
dared
address
her
and
hated
him
for
taking
part
against
her
near
as
their
dwellings
were
divided
only
by
the
river
and
a
breadth
of
their
intercourse
had
always
been
of
the
slightest
for
harding
possessed
a
reserve
as
great
as
her
own
but
from
this
hour
their
intercourse
ceased
entirely
the
boor
the
tale
of
her
overweening
pride
through
the
hamlet
and
when
next
she
appeared
there
she
was
greeted
with
derision
this
is
she
that
holds
herself
unfit
to
mate
with
an
honest
man
cried
some
and
others
nay
do
but
see
the
silken
gown
of
the
great
lady
rosalind
see
the
fine
jewels
of
her
she
thinks
she
outshines
the
queen
of
bramber
self
scoffed
a
woman
and
a
man
demanded
what
blood
good
enough
to
mix
with
hers
if
ours
be
not
a
king
flashed
rosalind
and
even
as
she
spoke
the
jeering
throng
parted
to
let
one
by
that
elbowed
his
way
among
them
and
a
second
time
she
saw
the
red
hunter
come
to
halt
and
fix
her
before
all
the
people
now
this
time
she
vowed
silently
you
may
gaze
till
night
fall
and
day
rise
again
red
man
if
you
think
to
lower
my
eyes
in
the
presence
of
these
so
she
stood
and
looked
him
in
the
face
like
a
queen
all
her
spirit
nerving
her
and
the
people
knew
it
to
be
battle
between
them
harding
great
arms
were
folded
across
his
breast
and
on
his
countenance
was
no
expressiveness
at
all
but
a
strange
light
grew
and
brightened
in
his
eyes
till
little
by
little
all
else
was
blurred
and
hazy
in
the
girl
sight
and
blue
fire
seemed
to
lap
her
from
her
tawny
hair
to
her
bare
feet
then
she
knew
nothing
except
that
she
must
look
away
or
burn
and
her
eyes
fell
harding
walked
past
her
as
he
had
done
before
and
not
till
he
was
out
of
hearing
did
the
bystanders
begin
their
cruelty
a
king
blood
for
the
lady
that
droops
to
a
common
smith
cried
they
she
shall
swing
his
hammer
for
a
scepter
cried
they
shall
sit
on
anvil
for
a
throne
cried
they
shall
queen
it
in
a
leathern
apron
o
sundays
cried
they
rosalind
fled
amid
their
howls
of
laughter
she
hated
them
all
and
far
beyond
them
all
she
hated
him
who
had
lowered
her
head
in
their
sight
it
was
after
this
that
the
proud
rosalind
but
here
without
even
trouble
to
finish
his
sentence
martin
pippin
suddenly
thrust
with
his
foot
at
the
seat
of
the
swing
nearly
dislodging
jane
with
the
action
who
screamed
and
clutched
first
at
the
ropes
and
next
at
the
branches
as
she
went
up
and
last
of
all
at
martin
as
she
came
down
she
clutched
him
so
piteously
that
in
pure
pity
he
clutched
her
and
lifting
her
bodily
out
of
her
peril
set
her
on
his
knee
martin
with
great
concern
are
you
better
mistress
jane
jane
where
are
your
manners
master
pippin
martin
my
mother
mislaid
them
before
i
was
born
but
are
you
better
now
jane
i
am
not
sure
i
was
very
much
upset
martin
so
was
jane
it
was
all
your
doing
martin
i
could
have
sworn
it
was
half
yours
jane
who
disturbed
the
swing
pray
martin
every
effect
proceeds
from
its
cause
the
swing
was
disturbed
because
i
was
disturbed
jane
every
cause
once
had
its
effect
what
effected
your
disturbance
master
pippin
martin
yours
mistress
jane
jane
mine
martin
confess
that
you
were
disturbed
jane
yes
and
with
good
cause
martin
i
ca
doubt
it
yet
that
was
the
mischief
i
could
find
no
logical
cause
for
your
disturbance
and
an
illogical
world
proceeds
from
confusion
to
chaos
for
want
of
a
little
logic
my
foot
and
your
swing
passed
out
of
control
jane
the
logic
had
only
to
be
asked
for
and
it
would
have
been
forthcoming
martin
is
it
too
late
to
ask
jane
it
is
never
too
late
to
be
reasonable
but
why
am
i
sitting
on
why
am
i
sitting
here
martin
for
the
best
of
reasons
you
are
sitting
where
you
are
sitting
because
the
swing
is
so
disturbed
please
teach
me
to
be
reasonable
dear
mistress
jane
why
were
you
disturbed
jane
very
well
i
was
naturally
greatly
disturbed
to
learn
that
your
heroine
hated
your
hero
because
it
is
your
errand
to
relate
and
i
can
not
see
the
connection
between
love
and
hate
could
two
things
more
antagonistic
conclude
in
union
martin
yes
jane
what
martin
a
button
and
buttonhole
for
one
is
something
and
the
other
nothing
and
what
in
the
very
nature
of
things
could
be
more
antagonistic
than
these
so
saying
he
tore
a
button
from
his
shirt
and
put
it
into
her
hand
do
drop
it
said
martin
because
i
have
another
and
besides
every
prefers
its
own
button
yet
i
will
never
ask
you
to
them
until
my
tale
proves
to
your
satisfaction
that
out
of
antagonisms
unions
can
spring
very
well
said
jane
and
she
took
out
of
her
pocket
a
neat
little
housewife
and
put
the
button
carefully
inside
it
then
she
said
the
swing
is
quite
still
now
but
are
you
sure
you
feel
better
said
martin
yes
thank
you
said
jane
it
was
after
this
said
martin
that
the
proud
rosalind
became
known
by
her
title
it
was
fastened
on
her
in
derision
and
when
she
heard
it
she
set
her
lips
and
thought
what
they
speak
in
mockery
shall
be
the
truth
and
the
more
men
sought
to
shame
her
the
prouder
she
bore
herself
she
ceased
all
commerce
with
them
from
this
time
so
for
five
years
she
lived
in
great
loneliness
and
want
but
gradually
she
came
to
know
that
even
this
existence
of
friendless
want
was
not
to
be
life
but
a
continual
for
she
had
no
resources
and
was
put
to
bitter
shifts
if
she
would
live
hunger
nosed
at
her
door
and
she
had
need
of
her
pride
to
clothe
her
for
the
more
she
went
wan
and
naked
the
more
men
mocked
her
to
see
her
hold
herself
so
high
and
out
of
their
hearts
she
shut
that
charity
which
she
would
never
have
endured
of
them
if
she
had
gone
kneeling
to
their
doors
with
pitiful
hands
saying
i
starve
not
having
wherewithal
to
eat
i
perish
not
having
wherewithal
to
cover
me
they
would
perhaps
have
fed
and
clothed
her
aglow
with
but
they
were
not
prompt
with
the
charity
which
warms
the
object
only
and
not
the
donor
and
she
on
her
part
tried
to
appear
as
though
she
needed
nothing
at
their
hands
one
evening
when
the
woods
were
in
full
leaf
and
summer
on
the
edge
of
its
zenith
proud
rosalind
walked
among
the
trees
seeking
green
herbs
for
soup
she
had
wandered
far
afield
because
there
were
no
woods
near
the
castle
standing
on
its
high
ground
above
the
open
flats
and
the
river
beyond
but
gazing
over
the
water
she
could
see
the
groves
and
crests
upon
the
hills
where
some
sustenance
was
the
swift
way
was
over
the
river
but
there
was
no
boat
to
serve
her
except
harding
and
this
was
a
service
she
had
never
asked
of
old
and
lately
would
rather
have
died
than
ask
so
she
took
daily
to
the
winding
roads
that
led
to
a
distant
bridge
and
the
hills
with
their
forests
this
day
her
need
was
at
its
sorest
when
she
had
gathered
a
meager
crop
she
sat
down
under
a
tree
and
began
to
sort
out
the
herbs
upon
her
knees
one
tender
leaf
she
could
not
resist
taking
between
her
teeth
that
had
had
so
little
else
of
late
to
bite
on
and
as
she
did
so
coarse
laughter
broke
upon
her
it
was
her
rude
suitor
who
had
chanced
across
her
path
and
he
mocked
at
her
crying
this
is
the
proud
rosalind
that
will
not
eat
at
an
honest
man
board
choosing
rather
to
dine
after
the
high
fashion
of
the
kine
and
asses
then
from
his
pouch
he
snatched
a
crust
of
bread
and
flung
it
to
her
and
said
proud
rosalind
will
you
stoop
for
your
supper
she
rose
letting
the
precious
herbs
drop
from
her
lap
and
she
trod
them
into
the
earth
as
weeds
gathered
at
hazard
so
that
the
putting
of
the
leaf
between
her
lips
might
wear
an
idle
aspect
and
then
she
walked
away
with
her
head
very
high
but
she
was
nearly
desperate
at
leaving
them
there
and
when
she
was
alone
her
pain
of
hunger
increased
beyond
all
bounds
and
she
sat
down
on
the
limb
of
a
great
beech
and
leaned
her
brow
against
his
mighty
body
and
shut
her
eyes
while
the
light
changed
in
the
sky
and
presently
the
leaves
of
the
forest
were
lit
by
the
moon
instead
of
the
sun
and
the
spaces
in
the
top
boughs
were
dark
blue
instead
of
saffron
and
the
small
clouds
were
no
longer
fragments
of
amber
but
bits
of
mottled
pearl
seen
through
but
rosalind
witnessed
none
of
these
slow
changes
and
when
after
a
great
while
she
lifted
her
faint
head
she
saw
only
that
the
day
was
changed
to
night
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
touched
with
moonlight
a
motionless
white
stag
stood
watching
her
it
was
a
hart
of
the
sixth
year
and
stood
already
higher
than
any
hart
of
the
twelfth
full
five
foot
high
it
stood
and
its
grand
soft
shining
flanks
seemed
to
be
molded
of
marble
for
their
grandeur
and
silk
for
their
smoothness
and
moonlight
for
their
sheen
its
new
antlers
were
branching
towards
their
yearly
strength
and
the
crowns
rose
proudly
from
the
beam
that
was
their
last
perfection
the
eyes
of
the
girl
and
the
beast
met
full
and
neither
wavered
the
hart
came
to
her
noiselessly
and
laid
its
muzzle
on
her
hair
and
when
she
put
her
hand
on
its
pure
side
it
arched
its
noble
neck
and
licked
her
cheek
then
stepping
as
proudly
and
as
delicately
as
rosalind
self
it
moved
on
through
the
trees
and
she
followed
it
the
forest
changed
from
beech
to
pine
and
fir
it
deepened
and
grew
strange
to
her
she
did
not
know
it
and
the
light
of
the
sky
turned
here
from
silver
to
gray
and
she
felt
about
her
the
stir
of
unseen
things
but
she
looked
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
but
followed
the
hart
that
went
before
her
it
brought
her
at
last
to
its
own
and
as
soon
as
she
saw
it
old
rumors
gathered
themselves
into
a
truth
and
she
knew
that
this
was
the
lost
and
she
remembered
that
this
night
was
midsummer
eve
and
by
the
position
of
the
ghostly
moon
she
saw
it
was
close
on
midnight
so
she
knelt
down
by
the
edge
of
the
mere
and
stretched
her
hands
above
it
the
palms
to
the
stars
and
in
a
low
clear
voice
she
made
her
prayer
whatever
spirit
dwells
under
these
waters
said
she
i
know
not
whether
you
are
a
power
for
good
or
ill
but
if
it
is
true
that
you
will
answer
in
this
hour
the
need
of
any
that
calls
on
you
oh
spirit
my
need
is
very
great
hunger
is
bitter
in
my
body
and
my
strength
is
nearly
wasted
a
hind
cast
me
his
crust
and
five
hours
i
have
battled
with
myself
not
to
creep
back
to
the
place
where
it
still
lies
and
eat
of
that
vile
bread
i
do
not
fear
to
die
but
i
fear
to
die
of
my
hunger
lest
they
sneer
at
the
last
of
my
race
brought
low
to
so
mean
a
death
neither
will
i
die
by
my
own
act
lest
they
think
my
courage
broken
by
these
breaking
days
on
my
knees
said
she
i
beseech
you
to
send
me
in
some
wise
a
little
money
if
it
be
but
a
handful
of
pennies
now
and
then
throughout
the
year
so
that
i
may
keep
my
head
unbowed
or
if
this
is
too
much
to
ask
and
even
of
you
the
asking
is
not
easy
then
send
some
high
and
sudden
accident
of
death
to
blot
me
out
before
i
grow
too
humble
and
the
lofty
spirits
of
my
fathers
deny
one
whose
spirit
ends
as
lowly
as
their
dust
death
or
life
i
beg
of
you
and
i
care
not
which
you
send
then
clasping
her
hands
tightly
she
called
twice
more
her
plea
across
the
mere
spirit
of
these
waters
grant
me
life
or
death
oh
spirit
grant
me
life
or
death
there
was
a
stir
in
the
forest
as
she
made
an
end
and
she
remained
stock
still
waiting
and
wondering
but
though
she
knelt
there
till
the
moon
had
crossed
the
bar
of
midnight
nothing
happened
then
the
white
hart
which
had
lain
beside
the
water
while
she
prayed
rose
silently
and
drank
and
when
it
was
satisfied
laid
once
more
its
muzzle
on
her
hair
and
licked
her
cheek
again
and
moved
away
not
a
twig
snapped
under
its
slender
stepping
its
whiteness
was
soon
covered
by
the
blackness
faint
and
exhausted
rosalind
arose
she
dragged
herself
through
the
wood
and
presently
found
the
broad
road
that
curled
down
the
deserted
hill
and
over
the
bridge
and
at
last
by
a
branching
lane
to
her
ruined
dwelling
the
door
of
her
tower
creaked
desolately
to
and
fro
a
little
open
as
she
had
left
it
she
pushed
it
further
ajar
and
stumbled
in
and
up
the
narrow
stair
but
the
pale
moonlight
entered
her
chamber
with
her
silvering
the
oaken
stump
that
was
her
table
and
there
where
there
had
been
nothing
she
beheld
two
little
heaps
of
copper
coins
the
gold
year
waned
and
the
next
passed
from
white
to
green
and
in
the
gold
harding
began
to
hunt
his
hart
and
by
the
green
had
not
succeeded
in
bringing
it
to
bay
twice
he
had
seen
it
at
a
distance
on
the
hills
and
once
had
started
it
from
cover
in
coombe
wood
and
followed
it
through
the
denture
and
stammers
great
bottom
and
gumber
earthem
wood
and
long
down
nore
hill
and
little
down
and
at
punchbowl
green
he
lost
it
he
did
not
care
a
long
chase
had
whetted
him
and
he
had
waited
so
long
that
he
was
willing
to
wait
another
year
and
if
need
were
two
or
three
for
his
royal
quarry
he
knew
it
must
be
his
at
last
and
he
loved
it
the
more
for
the
speed
and
strength
and
cunning
with
which
it
defied
him
it
had
a
secret
lair
he
could
never
discover
but
one
day
that
secret
too
should
be
his
own
meanwhile
his
blood
was
heated
and
the
red
hunter
dreamed
of
the
hart
and
of
one
other
thing
and
while
he
dreamed
proud
rosalind
grew
glad
and
strong
on
her
miraculous
dole
of
money
that
was
always
to
her
hand
when
she
had
need
of
it
fear
went
out
of
her
life
for
she
knew
certainly
now
that
she
was
in
the
keeping
of
unseen
powers
and
would
not
lack
again
and
little
by
little
she
too
began
to
build
a
dream
out
of
her
pride
for
she
thought
i
am
all
my
fathers
house
and
there
will
be
no
honor
to
it
more
except
that
which
can
come
through
me
and
whenever
tales
went
about
of
the
fame
of
the
fair
young
queen
of
bramber
castle
and
the
crowning
of
her
name
in
this
tourney
and
in
that
or
of
the
great
lords
and
princes
that
would
have
died
for
one
smile
of
her
yet
her
smiles
came
easily
and
her
kisses
too
men
said
rosalind
knit
her
brows
and
her
longing
grew
a
little
stronger
and
she
thought
if
arrows
and
steel
might
once
flash
lightnings
about
my
father
daughter
and
cleave
the
shadows
that
have
hung
their
webs
about
my
fathers
hearth
she
now
began
to
put
by
a
little
hoard
of
pennies
for
she
meant
to
buy
flax
to
spin
the
finest
of
linen
for
her
body
and
purple
for
sleeves
for
her
arms
and
scarlet
leather
for
shoes
for
her
feet
and
gold
for
a
fillet
for
her
head
and
so
attired
at
last
as
became
her
birth
one
day
to
attend
a
tourney
where
perhaps
some
knight
would
fight
his
battle
in
her
name
and
she
had
no
other
thought
in
this
than
glory
to
her
dead
race
but
her
precious
store
mounted
slowly
and
she
had
laid
by
nothing
but
the
money
for
the
fine
linen
for
her
robe
when
a
thing
happened
that
shattered
her
last
foothold
among
men
for
suddenly
all
the
countryside
was
alive
with
a
strange
rumor
some
one
had
seen
a
hart
upon
the
hills
a
hart
of
twelve
points
fit
for
royal
hunting
kings
will
hunt
no
lesser
game
than
this
but
this
of
all
harts
was
surely
born
to
be
hunted
only
by
a
maiden
queen
for
said
the
rumor
it
was
as
white
as
snow
such
a
hart
had
never
before
been
heard
of
and
at
first
the
tale
of
it
was
not
believed
but
the
tale
was
repeated
from
mouth
to
mouth
until
at
last
all
men
swore
to
it
and
all
winds
carried
it
and
amongst
others
some
wind
of
the
downs
bore
it
across
the
land
from
arun
to
adur
and
so
it
reached
the
ears
of
queen
maudlin
of
bramber
then
she
a
creature
of
quick
whims
who
was
sated
with
the
easy
conquests
of
her
beauty
yet
eager
always
for
triumphs
to
cap
triumphs
devised
a
journey
from
adur
to
arun
and
a
great
summer
season
of
revelry
to
end
in
an
autumn
chase
and
said
she
we
will
have
joustings
and
dancings
in
beauty
honor
but
she
whose
knight
at
the
end
of
all
brings
her
the
antlers
of
the
hart
shall
be
known
for
ever
in
sussex
as
the
queen
of
beauty
since
once
i
have
hunted
it
the
hart
will
be
for
this
as
perhaps
you
know
dear
maidens
is
the
degree
of
any
hart
that
has
been
chased
by
royalty
however
before
the
festival
was
undertaken
the
queen
of
bramber
must
needs
know
if
the
arun
could
show
any
habitation
worthy
of
her
and
her
messengers
went
and
came
with
a
tale
of
a
noble
castle
fallen
into
ruins
but
with
its
walls
intact
and
a
sward
within
so
smooth
and
fair
that
it
seemed
only
to
await
the
coming
of
archers
and
dancers
so
the
queen
called
a
legion
of
workmen
and
bade
them
go
there
and
build
a
dwelling
in
one
part
of
the
green
court
for
her
to
stay
in
with
her
company
and
see
it
be
done
by
midsummer
said
she
castles
madam
said
the
head
workman
are
not
built
in
a
month
or
even
in
two
then
for
a
frolic
we
be
commoners
said
the
queen
and
you
shall
build
on
the
sward
not
a
castle
but
a
farm
so
the
workmen
hurried
away
and
set
to
work
and
by
june
they
had
raised
within
the
castle
walls
the
most
beautiful
farmhouse
in
sussex
and
over
the
door
made
a
room
fit
for
a
queen
but
alas
for
proud
rosalind
when
the
men
first
came
she
confronted
them
angrily
and
commanded
them
to
depart
from
her
fathers
halls
and
the
head
workman
looked
at
the
ruin
and
her
rags
and
said
what
halls
girl
and
where
are
these
fathers
and
who
are
you
and
bade
his
men
get
about
the
work
and
rosalind
was
helpless
the
men
from
the
adur
asked
the
people
of
the
arun
about
her
and
what
rights
she
had
to
be
where
she
was
and
they
being
unfriendly
to
her
said
none
she
is
a
beggar
with
a
bee
in
her
bonnet
and
thinks
she
was
once
a
queen
because
her
housing
was
once
a
castle
she
has
been
suffered
to
stay
as
long
as
it
was
unwanted
but
since
your
queen
wants
it
now
let
her
go
and
they
came
in
a
body
to
drive
her
forth
but
they
got
there
too
late
the
proud
rosalind
had
abandoned
her
conquered
stronghold
and
where
she
lived
from
this
time
nobody
knew
she
was
still
seen
on
the
roads
and
hills
now
and
again
and
once
as
she
passed
through
bury
on
the
women
by
the
river
called
to
her
where
do
you
live
now
proud
rosalind
instead
of
in
a
castle
and
rosalind
glanced
down
at
the
kneeling
women
and
said
in
her
clear
voice
i
live
in
a
castle
nobler
than
bramber
or
even
than
amberley
i
live
in
the
mightiest
castle
in
sussex
and
queen
maudlin
herself
could
not
build
such
another
to
live
in
then
you
doubtless
be
making
her
a
great
entertainment
there
proud
rosalind
scoffed
the
washers
i
entertain
none
but
the
kings
of
the
earth
there
said
rosalind
and
she
made
to
walk
on
why
then
mocked
they
you
best
seek
one
out
to
hunt
the
white
hart
in
your
name
this
autumn
and
crown
you
queen
over
young
maudlin
proud
rosalind
and
rosalind
stopped
and
looked
at
them
longing
to
say
the
white
hart
what
do
you
mean
yet
for
all
her
longing
to
know
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
ask
anything
of
them
but
as
though
her
thoughts
had
taken
voice
of
themselves
she
heard
the
sharp
questions
uttered
aloud
what
white
hart
chatterers
of
what
hunt
are
you
talking
and
there
in
stood
harding
in
his
boat
keeping
it
steady
with
the
great
pole
of
the
oar
why
red
boatman
said
they
did
you
not
know
that
the
queen
of
bramber
was
coming
to
make
merry
at
amberley
ay
said
harding
and
that
our
proud
lady
rosalind
having
it
seems
found
a
grander
castle
to
live
in
has
given
hers
up
to
young
maudlin
harding
glanced
to
and
from
the
scornful
tawny
girl
and
said
well
well
red
boatman
on
midsummer
eve
the
queen
comes
with
her
court
and
on
midsummer
day
there
will
be
a
great
tourney
to
open
the
revels
that
will
last
so
they
say
all
through
summer
but
the
end
of
it
all
is
to
be
a
great
chase
for
a
white
hart
of
twelve
points
has
been
seen
on
the
hills
and
the
queen
will
hunt
it
in
autumn
till
some
lucky
lord
kneels
at
her
feet
with
its
antlers
and
him
they
say
she
marry
then
harding
once
more
looked
at
rosalind
over
the
water
and
she
flung
back
a
look
at
him
and
each
was
surprised
to
see
dismay
on
the
brow
and
harding
thought
is
she
angry
because
she
is
not
the
queen
of
the
chase
and
rosalind
would
he
be
the
lord
who
kneels
to
queen
maudlin
but
neither
knew
that
the
trouble
in
each
was
really
because
their
precious
secret
was
now
public
and
the
white
hart
endangered
and
rosalind
thought
was
it
shall
be
no
queen
quarry
and
harding
it
shall
be
no
man
but
mine
then
harding
plied
his
way
to
the
ferry
and
rosalind
went
hers
to
none
knew
where
though
some
had
tried
vainly
to
track
her
in
due
course
june
passed
its
middle
and
the
queen
rode
under
the
downs
from
bramber
to
amberley
and
early
on
midsummer
eve
while
her
servants
made
busy
about
the
coming
festival
queen
maudlin
went
over
the
fields
to
the
waterside
and
lay
in
the
grass
looking
to
bury
and
teased
some
seven
of
her
court
each
of
whom
had
sworn
to
bring
her
the
crown
of
beauty
at
his
sword
point
on
the
morrow
her
four
maidens
were
with
her
all
maids
of
great
loveliness
there
was
linoret
who
was
like
morning
dew
on
grass
in
spring
and
clarimond
queenly
as
day
at
its
noon
and
damarel
like
a
rose
grown
languorous
of
its
own
grace
and
amelys
mysterious
as
the
spirit
of
dusk
with
dreams
in
its
hair
but
maudlin
was
the
pale
gold
wonder
of
the
dawn
a
creature
of
ethereal
light
a
vision
of
melting
stars
and
wakening
flowers
and
she
delighted
in
making
seem
cheap
the
palpable
prettiness
of
this
or
too
robust
the
fuller
beauty
of
that
or
dim
and
dull
the
elusive
charm
of
she
would
have
scorned
to
set
her
beauty
to
compete
with
those
who
were
not
beautiful
even
as
a
proved
knight
would
scorn
to
joust
with
an
unskilled
boor
so
now
amongst
her
beautiful
attendants
knowing
that
in
their
midst
her
greater
beauty
shone
forth
a
diamond
among
crystals
she
laughed
at
her
seven
lovers
and
her
four
friends
laughed
with
her
you
do
well
queen
maudlin
to
make
merry
said
one
of
the
knights
for
i
know
none
that
gains
so
much
service
for
so
little
portion
what
will
you
give
victor
what
will
victor
think
his
due
said
she
the
seven
said
in
a
breath
a
kiss
and
the
five
laughed
louder
than
ever
then
maudlin
said
for
so
great
an
honor
as
victory
i
should
feel
ashamed
to
bestow
a
thing
of
such
little
worth
do
you
call
that
thing
a
little
worth
said
one
which
to
us
were
more
than
a
star
plucked
out
of
heaven
the
thing
it
is
true
said
maudlin
has
two
values
those
who
are
make
it
a
thing
of
naught
those
from
whom
it
is
render
it
priceless
but
sirs
you
are
all
too
eager
i
could
scatter
you
baubles
by
the
hour
and
leave
you
still
desiring
but
if
ever
i
wooed
reluctance
to
receive
at
last
my
solitary
favor
i
should
know
i
was
bestowing
a
jewel
when
did
maudlin
ever
meet
reluctance
sighed
one
the
youngest
a
long
shadow
fell
upon
her
where
she
lay
in
the
grass
and
she
looked
up
to
see
the
great
form
of
harding
passing
at
a
little
distance
who
is
that
said
she
it
must
be
he
they
call
the
red
smith
said
damarel
idly
he
looks
a
rough
silent
creature
remarked
amelys
and
clarimond
added
in
loud
and
insolent
tones
he
knows
little
enough
of
kissings
i
would
wager
this
clasp
it
one
i
a
fancy
for
said
young
queen
maudlin
red
smith
called
she
harding
turned
at
the
sweet
sound
of
her
voice
and
came
and
stood
beside
her
among
the
group
of
girls
and
knights
have
you
come
from
my
castle
said
she
smiling
up
at
him
with
her
eyes
ay
he
answered
what
drew
you
there
big
man
my
the
red
smith
stared
down
at
her
light
alluring
loveliness
do
not
draw
me
what
metal
then
gold
maudlin
tossed
him
a
yellow
disc
from
her
purse
he
let
it
fall
and
lie
no
nor
gold
his
eyes
traveled
over
her
gleaming
locks
the
things
you
name
are
too
cheap
said
he
maudlin
smiled
a
little
and
raised
herself
till
she
stood
fair
and
slender
as
high
as
his
shoulder
what
thing
draws
you
red
smith
steel
and
he
showed
her
a
fine
lacking
its
hilt
i
was
sent
for
to
mend
this
against
the
morrow
i
know
that
blade
said
maudlin
it
was
snapped
in
my
cause
have
you
the
hilt
too
in
my
pouch
said
harding
his
hand
upon
it
hers
touched
his
fingers
delicately
i
will
see
it
he
brushed
her
hand
aside
and
unbuttoned
his
pouch
but
as
he
drew
out
the
hilt
of
the
broken
sword
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
that
within
which
held
her
startled
gaze
what
jewels
are
those
she
asked
quickly
old
relics
harding
said
with
sudden
gruffness
show
them
to
me
reluctantly
he
obeyed
and
brought
forth
a
ring
a
circlet
and
a
girdle
of
surpassing
workmanship
wrought
in
gold
with
emeralds
a
cry
of
wonder
went
up
from
all
the
maidens
there
something
else
said
maudlin
and
without
waiting
thrust
her
hand
into
the
bottom
of
the
pouch
and
drew
out
a
mesh
of
silver
it
was
so
fine
that
it
could
be
held
and
hidden
in
her
two
hands
yet
when
it
fell
apart
it
was
a
garment
as
supple
as
rich
silk
the
four
maids
touched
it
softly
and
looked
their
longings
are
these
your
handicraft
said
maudlin
mine
harding
uttered
a
short
laugh
not
i
or
any
man
can
make
such
things
you
are
right
said
maudlin
wayland
self
might
acknowledge
them
smith
i
will
buy
them
of
you
you
can
not
give
me
my
price
gold
i
know
does
not
tempt
you
she
smiled
and
came
close
beside
him
then
do
not
offer
it
shall
it
be
steel
harding
eyes
swept
her
beauty
not
from
queen
maudlin
true
my
bid
is
costlier
name
it
a
kiss
from
my
mouth
at
the
sound
of
his
laughter
the
rose
flowed
into
her
cheek
what
a
bauble
for
my
jewel
lady
he
said
harshly
do
the
women
of
this
land
hold
themselves
so
light
in
mine
men
carve
their
kisses
with
the
sword
hark
ye
young
queen
set
a
better
value
on
that
red
mouth
if
you
continue
to
have
it
valued
i
could
have
you
whipped
for
this
said
maudlin
i
do
not
think
so
harding
answered
and
stepped
down
the
into
his
waiting
boat
i
keep
my
clasp
said
clarimond
seven
men
sprang
hotly
to
their
feet
what
your
will
queen
nothing
said
maudlin
slowly
as
she
watched
him
row
over
the
water
let
the
smith
go
this
test
was
between
him
and
me
and
no
business
else
well
he
is
of
a
temper
to
come
through
fire
unmelted
she
flashed
a
smile
upon
the
seven
that
made
them
tremble
but
he
is
a
mannerless
churl
we
will
not
think
of
him
which
among
you
would
spurn
my
kiss
she
offered
her
mouth
in
turn
and
seven
flames
passed
over
its
scarlet
maudlin
laughed
a
little
and
beckoned
her
watching
maids
well
she
said
taking
the
path
to
the
castle
he
that
had
had
strength
to
refuse
me
might
have
worn
my
favor
and
for
ever
and
meanwhile
by
the
further
came
rosalind
with
mushrooms
in
her
skirt
and
as
she
walked
by
the
water
in
the
evening
she
looked
across
to
her
lost
and
touched
the
pennies
in
her
pouch
and
dreamed
while
the
sun
dressed
the
running
flood
in
his
royalest
colors
linen
and
purple
and
scarlet
and
gold
mused
she
and
so
i
might
sit
there
among
the
rest
but
linen
and
purple
she
said
in
scorn
what
should
they
profit
my
fathers
house
it
is
no
silken
daughter
we
lack
but
a
son
of
steel
and
as
she
pondered
a
shadow
crossed
her
and
out
of
his
boat
stepped
harding
new
from
his
encounter
with
the
queen
he
did
not
glance
at
her
nor
she
at
him
but
the
gleam
of
the
broken
weapon
he
carried
cut
for
a
single
instant
across
her
sight
and
her
hands
hungered
for
it
a
sword
thought
she
ay
but
an
arm
to
wield
the
sword
nay
if
i
had
the
sword
it
may
be
i
could
find
an
arm
to
wield
it
she
dropped
her
chin
on
her
breast
and
brooded
on
the
vanishing
shape
of
the
red
smith
if
i
had
been
my
fathers
son
oh
cried
she
shaken
with
new
dreams
what
would
i
not
give
to
the
man
who
would
strike
a
blow
for
our
house
then
she
recalled
what
day
it
was
a
year
of
miracles
and
changes
had
sped
over
her
life
if
she
desired
new
miracles
this
was
the
night
to
ask
them
so
close
on
midnight
proud
rosalind
once
more
crept
up
to
rewell
wood
and
on
its
beechen
skirts
the
white
hart
came
to
her
it
came
now
as
to
a
friend
not
to
a
stranger
and
she
threw
her
arm
over
its
neck
and
they
walked
together
as
they
walked
it
lowered
its
noble
antlers
so
cunningly
that
not
a
twig
snapped
from
the
boughs
and
its
antlers
were
as
beautiful
as
the
boughs
with
their
branches
and
twigs
and
to
each
crown
it
had
added
not
one
but
two
more
crockets
so
that
now
its
points
were
sixteen
safe
under
its
guard
the
maiden
ventured
into
the
mysteries
of
the
hour
and
when
they
came
to
the
mere
the
hart
lay
down
and
she
knelt
beside
it
with
her
brow
on
its
soft
panting
neck
and
thought
awhile
how
she
would
shape
her
wish
and
feeling
the
strength
of
its
sinews
she
said
aloud
oh
champion
among
stags
were
there
a
champion
among
men
to
match
you
i
think
even
i
could
love
him
yet
love
is
not
my
prayer
i
do
not
pray
for
myself
and
then
she
stood
upright
and
stretched
her
hands
towards
the
water
and
said
again
less
in
supplication
than
command
spirit
you
hear
i
do
not
pray
for
myself
of
old
it
may
be
maidens
often
came
in
sport
or
fear
to
make
a
pastime
of
their
oh
spirit
of
love
i
ask
nothing
for
myself
but
if
you
will
send
me
a
man
to
strike
one
blow
in
my
name
that
is
my
name
he
may
have
of
me
what
he
will
never
so
proudly
yet
had
the
proud
rosalind
held
herself
as
when
she
lifted
her
radiant
face
to
the
moon
and
sent
her
low
clear
call
thrice
over
the
mystic
waters
gloriously
she
stood
with
arms
extended
as
though
she
would
give
welcome
to
any
hero
stepping
through
the
night
to
consummate
her
wish
but
none
came
only
the
subdued
rustling
that
had
stirred
the
woods
a
year
ago
whispered
out
of
the
dark
and
died
to
silence
the
arms
of
the
proud
rosalind
dropped
to
her
sides
is
the
time
not
yet
said
she
and
will
it
never
be
why
then
let
me
belong
for
ever
to
the
champion
that
strikes
for
me
in
the
lists
a
sorry
champion
said
she
a
wan
smile
yet
i
will
hold
me
bound
to
him
according
to
my
vow
but
first
i
must
win
him
a
sword
then
she
kissed
the
white
hart
between
the
eyes
and
said
go
where
you
will
i
shall
be
gone
till
daylight
and
it
rose
up
to
run
the
moonlit
hills
and
she
went
down
through
the
trees
and
left
the
to
its
unruffled
peace
straight
down
towards
sleeping
bury
rosalind
went
full
of
her
purpose
and
after
an
hour
passed
through
the
silent
village
her
errand
was
not
wholly
easy
to
her
but
she
thought
i
do
not
go
to
ask
favors
but
plain
dealings
and
it
must
be
done
secretly
or
not
at
all
as
she
came
near
the
ferry
a
red
glow
broke
on
her
vision
does
the
water
burn
she
said
and
quickened
her
steps
to
her
surprise
she
saw
that
harding
forge
was
busy
the
light
she
had
seen
sprang
from
it
she
had
expected
to
find
it
locked
and
silent
but
now
the
little
space
it
held
in
the
night
was
lit
with
fire
and
resounded
with
the
stroke
of
the
red
smith
hammer
proud
rosalind
stood
fast
as
though
he
were
fashioning
a
spell
to
chain
her
eyes
and
so
he
was
for
he
hammered
on
a
sword
he
did
not
turn
his
head
at
her
approach
but
when
at
last
she
stood
beside
his
door
and
did
not
move
away
he
spoke
to
her
you
walk
late
said
he
may
not
people
walk
late
said
she
as
well
as
work
late
without
answering
he
set
himself
to
his
task
again
and
heeded
her
no
more
smith
she
cried
imperiously
what
then
i
came
to
speak
with
you
even
so
she
barely
heard
the
words
for
the
din
of
his
great
hammer
you
are
unmannerly
smith
speak
then
said
he
dropping
his
tools
and
never
forget
maid
that
it
is
not
i
invited
this
encounter
at
that
she
cried
out
hotly
does
not
your
shop
invite
trade
ay
but
what
that
to
you
my
only
purpose
in
talking
with
you
she
said
in
a
flame
of
wrath
i
require
what
you
have
but
i
would
rather
buy
it
of
any
man
than
you
what
do
you
require
that
she
pointed
to
the
sword
i
can
not
sell
it
it
is
a
young
knight
blade
i
am
mending
against
the
jousting
have
you
no
other
you
can
not
give
me
my
price
said
the
red
smith
she
took
from
her
girdle
the
little
purse
containing
all
her
store
do
you
think
i
am
here
to
bargain
there
more
than
your
price
however
much
it
be
said
harding
it
is
too
little
then
say
no
more
that
i
can
not
buy
of
you
but
rather
that
you
will
not
sell
to
me
and
yet
that
is
as
the
proud
rosalind
shall
please
she
flushed
deeply
and
as
though
in
shame
of
seeming
ashamed
said
firmly
no
smith
it
is
not
in
my
hands
for
i
have
offered
you
every
penny
i
possess
i
do
not
ask
for
pence
harding
left
his
anvil
and
stepped
outside
and
stood
close
gazing
hard
upon
her
face
you
have
a
thing
i
will
take
in
exchange
for
my
sword
a
very
simple
thing
women
part
with
it
most
lightly
i
have
learned
the
loveliest
hold
it
cheap
at
the
price
of
a
golden
gawd
how
easily
then
will
you
barter
it
for
an
inch
or
so
of
steel
what
need
of
so
many
words
she
said
with
a
scornful
lip
that
quivered
in
her
own
despite
at
his
nearness
name
the
thing
you
want
a
kiss
from
your
mouth
proud
rosalind
it
was
as
though
the
request
had
turned
her
into
ice
when
she
could
speak
she
said
smith
for
your
inch
of
steel
you
have
asked
what
i
would
not
part
with
to
ransom
my
soul
she
turned
and
left
him
and
harding
went
back
to
his
work
and
laughed
softly
in
his
beard
dream
on
my
gold
queen
up
yonder
said
he
and
blew
on
his
waning
fires
you
are
not
the
metal
i
work
in
said
he
and
the
river
rang
again
to
his
hammer
on
the
steel
but
rosalind
went
rapidly
down
to
the
waterside
saying
in
her
heart
now
i
will
see
whether
i
can
not
get
me
a
lordlier
weapon
of
a
better
craftsman
than
you
and
at
my
own
price
red
smith
and
when
she
had
come
to
the
ferry
she
laid
her
full
purse
on
the
bank
and
cried
softly
into
the
night
wayland
smith
give
me
a
sword
and
then
she
went
away
for
awhile
and
paced
the
fields
till
the
first
light
glimmered
on
the
east
and
not
daring
to
wait
longer
for
fear
of
encountering
early
risers
she
turned
back
to
the
ferry
and
there
shining
in
the
dawn
she
found
such
a
blade
as
made
the
father
in
her
soul
exult
in
all
its
glorious
fashioning
and
splendid
temper
the
hand
of
the
god
was
manifest
and
in
the
grass
beside
it
lay
her
purse
of
its
full
store
lightened
by
one
now
to
this
tale
of
legends
revived
and
then
forgotten
gossips
tales
of
and
harts
and
a
god
who
worked
in
the
dark
we
must
begin
to
add
the
legend
of
the
rusty
knight
it
lasted
little
longer
than
the
three
months
of
that
strange
summer
of
sports
within
the
of
amberley
it
was
at
the
jousting
on
midsummer
day
that
he
first
was
seen
the
lists
were
open
and
the
roll
of
knights
had
answered
to
their
names
and
cried
in
all
men
ears
their
praises
and
nine
in
ten
cried
maudlin
and
as
the
last
knight
spoke
there
suddenly
stood
in
the
great
gateway
an
unknown
man
with
his
vizard
closed
and
his
coming
was
greeted
with
a
roar
of
laughter
for
he
was
clothed
from
head
to
foot
in
antique
arms
battered
and
rusted
like
old
pots
and
pans
that
have
seen
a
twelvemonths
weather
in
a
ditch
out
of
the
merriment
occasioned
by
his
appearance
certain
of
the
spectators
began
to
cry
a
champion
a
champion
and
others
nudged
with
their
elbows
chuckling
it
is
the
queen
jester
but
the
newcomer
stood
his
ground
unflinchingly
and
when
he
could
be
heard
cried
fiercely
they
who
call
me
jester
shall
find
they
jest
before
their
time
i
claim
by
my
kingly
birth
to
take
part
in
this
day
fray
and
men
shall
meet
me
to
their
rue
by
what
name
shall
we
know
you
he
was
asked
you
shall
call
me
the
knight
of
the
royal
heart
he
said
and
whose
cause
do
you
serve
hers
whose
beauty
outshines
the
beauty
in
the
gallery
said
he
hers
who
was
mistress
here
and
wrongly
ousted
the
most
peerless
lady
of
sussex
proud
rosalind
with
that
the
stranger
drew
forth
and
flourished
a
blade
of
so
surpassing
a
kind
that
the
knights
in
whom
scorn
had
vanquished
mirth
found
envy
vanquishing
scorn
as
for
the
ladies
they
had
ceased
to
smile
at
the
mention
of
rosalind
whom
none
had
seen
though
all
had
heard
of
the
girl
who
had
been
turned
from
her
ruin
at
maudlin
whim
and
that
this
ragged
lady
should
be
vaunted
over
their
heads
was
an
insult
only
equaled
by
the
presence
among
their
shining
champions
of
the
rusty
knight
for
by
this
name
only
was
he
spoken
thereafter
now
you
may
think
that
the
imperious
stranger
who
warned
his
opponents
against
laughing
before
their
time
might
well
have
been
warned
against
crowing
before
his
and
alas
it
transpired
that
he
crowed
not
as
the
cock
crows
who
knows
the
sun
will
rise
for
at
the
first
clash
he
fell
almost
unnoticed
and
when
the
combatants
disengaged
he
had
disappeared
he
was
a
subject
for
much
mirth
that
evening
though
the
men
rankled
for
his
sword
and
the
women
for
a
sight
of
his
lady
but
from
this
day
there
was
not
a
jousting
held
in
maudlin
revels
at
which
the
rusty
knight
did
not
appear
and
none
from
which
he
bore
away
the
crown
the
procedure
was
always
the
same
at
the
last
instant
he
appeared
in
his
ignominious
arms
and
stung
the
mockers
to
silence
by
the
glory
of
his
sword
and
his
undaunted
proclamation
of
his
lady
so
ardent
was
his
manner
that
it
was
difficult
not
to
believe
him
a
conqueror
among
men
and
her
the
loveliest
of
women
until
the
fray
began
when
he
was
instantly
overcome
and
in
the
confusion
managed
to
escape
he
was
so
cunning
in
this
that
though
traps
were
laid
to
catch
him
he
was
never
traced
by
degrees
he
became
instead
of
a
joke
a
thorn
in
the
flesh
it
was
the
women
now
who
itched
to
see
his
face
and
the
men
who
desired
to
find
out
the
proud
rosalind
for
by
his
repeated
assertion
her
beauty
came
to
be
believed
in
and
if
the
ladies
still
spoke
slightingly
of
her
the
lords
in
their
thoughts
did
not
but
the
summer
drew
to
its
close
without
unraveling
the
mystery
the
rusty
knight
was
never
followed
nor
the
proud
rosalind
found
and
now
they
were
on
the
eve
of
a
different
hunting
for
now
all
the
days
were
to
be
given
up
to
the
pursuit
of
the
rumored
hart
whom
none
had
yet
beheld
and
queen
maudlin
said
for
a
month
we
will
hunt
by
day
and
dance
by
night
and
if
by
that
time
no
man
can
boast
of
bringing
the
hart
to
bay
and
no
woman
of
owning
his
antlers
we
will
acknowledge
ourselves
outwitted
and
so
go
back
to
adur
and
it
may
prove
that
we
have
been
brought
to
arun
by
an
idle
tale
to
hunt
a
myth
but
be
that
as
it
may
see
to
your
bowstrings
for
we
ride
forth
and
the
men
laid
by
their
swords
and
filled
their
quivers
and
in
the
midnight
rosalind
came
once
more
from
her
secret
lair
to
bury
and
laying
her
purse
by
the
ferry
called
softly
wayland
smith
give
me
a
bow
and
in
the
dawn
before
people
were
astir
she
found
a
bow
the
unlike
of
any
fashioned
by
mortal
craft
and
a
quiverful
of
true
arrows
and
for
these
the
god
had
taken
his
penny
fee
on
a
lovely
day
of
autumn
the
chase
began
and
the
red
deer
and
the
red
fox
started
from
their
covers
and
the
small
rabbits
stopped
their
on
the
steep
warrens
of
the
downs
and
fled
into
their
burrows
and
birds
whirred
up
in
screaming
coveys
and
the
kestrel
hovered
high
and
motionless
on
the
watch
there
was
game
in
plenty
and
many
men
were
tempted
and
forgot
the
prize
they
sought
the
hunt
separated
some
going
this
way
and
some
that
and
in
the
evening
all
met
again
in
amberley
and
some
had
game
to
show
and
some
had
none
and
one
had
seen
the
hart
when
he
said
so
a
cry
went
up
from
the
company
and
they
pressed
round
to
hear
his
tale
and
it
was
a
strange
one
for
said
he
where
great
down
clothes
itself
with
the
north
wood
i
saw
a
flash
against
the
dark
of
the
trees
and
out
of
them
bounded
the
very
hart
taller
than
any
hart
i
ever
dreamed
of
and
as
the
tale
has
told
as
pure
as
snow
and
the
crockets
spring
from
its
crowns
like
rays
from
a
summer
cloud
i
could
not
count
them
but
its
points
are
more
than
twelve
when
it
saw
me
it
stood
motionless
and
trembling
with
joy
i
fitted
my
arrow
to
the
string
but
even
as
i
did
so
out
of
the
trees
ran
another
creature
as
strange
as
the
white
hart
it
was
none
other
than
the
rusty
knight
i
knew
him
by
his
battered
vizard
which
was
closed
but
for
the
rest
he
wore
now
not
rust
but
rags
a
tattered
jerkin
in
place
of
battered
mail
yet
in
his
hands
was
a
bow
which
among
weapons
could
only
be
matched
by
his
sword
he
took
his
stand
beside
the
hart
and
cried
in
that
angry
voice
we
have
all
heard
these
crowns
grow
only
to
the
glory
of
the
proud
rosalind
the
most
peerless
daughter
of
sussex
and
no
woman
but
she
shall
ever
boast
of
them
and
before
i
could
move
or
answer
for
surprise
he
had
set
his
arrow
to
his
bow
and
drawn
the
string
back
to
his
shoulder
and
let
fly
it
was
well
i
did
not
start
aside
or
it
might
have
hit
me
for
i
never
saw
an
arrow
fly
so
wild
of
its
mark
but
the
whole
circumstance
amazed
me
too
much
for
quick
action
and
before
i
could
come
up
and
chastise
this
unskillful
archer
or
even
aim
at
the
prize
which
stood
beside
him
he
and
the
hart
had
plunged
through
the
wood
again
the
man
running
swiftfoot
as
the
beast
and
when
i
followed
i
could
not
find
them
and
unhappily
my
dogs
were
astray
the
strange
tale
stung
the
tempers
of
all
listeners
both
men
and
women
well
now
laughed
maudlin
it
has
at
least
been
seen
that
the
hart
is
the
whitest
of
harts
but
it
has
not
yet
been
seen
fumed
clarimond
that
this
rosalind
is
the
most
beautiful
of
women
nor
have
we
seen
said
the
knight
who
told
the
tale
who
it
is
that
insults
our
manhood
with
valiant
words
and
no
deeds
to
prove
them
yet
with
such
a
sword
and
such
a
bow
a
man
might
prove
anything
the
next
day
all
rode
forth
on
fire
with
eagerness
and
at
the
end
of
it
another
knight
brought
back
the
selfsame
tale
he
sword
that
in
the
tattered
archer
was
no
harm
at
all
but
his
arrogance
since
he
was
clearly
incapable
of
hitting
where
he
aimed
but
his
very
presence
and
his
swift
escape
running
beside
the
hart
made
failure
seem
double
for
the
derision
he
excited
recoiled
on
the
deriders
who
could
not
bring
this
contemptible
foe
to
book
after
that
day
many
saw
him
sometimes
at
a
great
distance
sometimes
near
enough
to
be
lashed
by
his
insolent
tongue
he
always
kept
beside
the
coveted
quarry
as
though
to
guard
it
and
ran
when
it
ran
with
incredible
speed
but
once
when
he
flagged
after
a
longer
chase
than
usual
he
had
been
seen
to
leap
on
its
back
and
so
they
escaped
together
from
dawn
to
dusk
through
that
bright
month
of
autumn
the
man
and
the
hart
were
hunted
in
vain
and
in
all
that
while
their
lair
was
never
discovered
it
was
now
taken
for
granted
that
where
one
would
be
the
other
would
be
and
in
all
likelihood
proud
rosalind
also
at
last
the
final
day
of
the
month
and
the
chase
arrived
and
maudlin
spoke
to
her
mortified
company
among
them
all
she
was
the
only
one
who
laughed
now
for
her
nature
was
like
that
of
running
water
reflecting
all
things
retaining
none
she
could
never
retain
her
disappointments
longer
than
a
day
or
her
affections
either
sirs
and
dames
said
she
i
see
by
your
clouded
faces
it
is
time
we
departed
but
we
will
depart
as
we
came
in
the
sun
if
this
day
bring
no
more
fruit
than
its
fellows
neither
victory
to
a
lord
nor
sovereignty
to
his
lady
we
will
hold
the
mightiest
tourney
of
the
year
and
he
who
wins
the
crown
shall
give
it
to
his
love
and
she
shall
be
called
for
ever
the
fairest
of
sussex
but
for
that
if
her
lord
desire
it
she
shall
wed
him
yes
though
it
be
myself
she
shall
and
at
this
the
hearts
of
nine
men
in
ten
leapt
in
their
breasts
for
longing
of
her
and
in
the
tenth
for
longing
of
linoret
or
clarimond
or
damarel
or
amelys
and
all
went
to
the
chase
thinking
as
much
of
the
morrow
as
of
the
day
it
was
the
day
when
the
forests
burned
their
brightest
the
earth
was
fuller
of
color
than
in
the
painted
spring
the
hedgerows
were
hung
with
brilliant
berries
in
wreaths
and
clusters
luminous
briony
and
honeysuckle
and
the
ebony
gloss
of
the
privet
making
more
vivid
the
bright
red
of
the
hips
and
the
dark
red
of
the
haws
the
smooth
flat
meadows
and
smooth
round
sides
of
the
downs
were
not
greener
in
june
nor
in
that
crystal
air
did
the
river
ever
run
bluer
than
under
that
blue
sky
the
elms
were
getting
already
their
dusky
gold
and
the
beeches
their
brighter
reds
and
golds
and
coppers
where
they
were
young
and
in
thin
leaf
the
watered
them
to
transparent
pinks
and
lemons
as
bright
though
not
as
burning
as
the
massed
colors
of
the
older
trees
that
day
there
was
magic
on
the
western
hills
for
those
who
could
see
it
and
trees
that
were
not
trees
so
rosalind
who
like
all
the
world
was
early
abroad
though
not
with
all
the
world
saw
a
silver
cloud
pretending
to
be
white
flowers
upon
a
hawthorn
never
in
spring
sunlight
had
the
bush
shone
whiter
but
when
maudlin
rode
by
later
she
saw
not
a
cloud
in
flower
but
a
flowerless
tree
dressed
with
the
whiteness
of
wild
clematis
its
tendrils
shining
through
their
own
mist
then
rosalind
saw
a
sunset
pretending
to
be
a
scattering
flecks
of
red
and
yellow
light
upon
the
ground
till
the
grass
threw
up
a
reflection
of
the
tree
as
a
cloud
in
the
east
will
reflect
another
in
the
west
but
when
maudlin
came
riding
the
spots
of
light
upon
the
ground
were
little
pointed
leaves
and
the
sunset
a
little
tree
as
round
as
a
clipped
yew
mottled
like
an
artist
palette
with
every
shade
from
primrose
to
orange
and
from
rose
to
crimson
and
last
in
a
green
glade
under
a
steep
hollow
overhung
with
ash
rosalind
saw
a
fairy
pretending
to
be
a
silver
birch
turned
golden
for
her
leaves
hung
like
the
shaking
water
of
a
sunlit
fountain
and
she
stood
alone
in
the
very
middle
of
the
glade
as
though
on
for
a
dance
and
all
the
green
trees
that
had
retreated
from
her
seemed
ready
to
break
into
music
so
that
rosalind
held
her
breath
lest
she
should
shatter
the
moment
and
the
magic
and
stayed
where
she
was
but
an
hour
afterwards
maudlin
riding
the
chalky
ledge
on
the
height
looked
down
on
that
same
sight
and
uttered
a
sharp
cry
for
she
saw
no
fairy
but
a
little
yellowing
birch
and
under
it
the
hart
with
the
rusty
knight
beside
him
then
all
the
company
with
her
echoed
the
cry
and
the
forest
was
filled
with
the
round
sounds
of
horns
and
belling
hounds
and
while
in
great
excitement
men
sought
a
way
down
into
the
steep
glen
the
hart
and
his
ragged
guard
had
started
up
and
vanished
through
the
underworld
of
trees
the
hue
and
cry
was
taken
up
not
one
or
two
but
fifty
had
now
seen
the
quarry
and
panted
for
the
glory
of
the
prize
and
so
near
the
very
beginning
of
the
day
the
chase
began
the
scent
was
found
and
lost
and
found
again
the
stag
swam
the
river
twice
once
at
south
stoke
and
once
at
houghton
bridge
and
the
man
swam
with
it
and
then
keeping
over
the
fields
they
ran
up
coombe
and
went
west
and
north
over
bignor
hill
and
farm
hill
through
the
kennels
and
tegleaze
they
were
sighted
on
lamb
lea
and
lost
in
charlton
they
were
seen
again
on
heyshott
and
vanished
in
herringdean
copse
they
crossed
the
last
in
sussex
and
ran
over
linch
down
and
treyford
nearly
into
hampshire
and
there
the
quarry
turned
and
tried
to
double
home
by
winden
wood
and
cotworth
down
the
marvel
was
that
the
rusty
knight
was
always
with
it
sometimes
beside
it
often
on
its
back
and
even
when
he
bestrode
it
it
flew
over
the
green
hills
like
a
white
sail
driven
by
a
wind
at
sea
or
a
cloud
flying
the
skies
when
it
doubled
it
had
shaken
off
the
greater
part
of
the
hunt
but
through
wellhanger
and
over
levin
some
followed
it
still
in
the
woods
of
malecomb
only
the
seven
knights
who
most
loved
maudlin
remained
staunch
and
they
were
spurred
by
hope
because
when
they
now
sighted
it
it
seemed
as
though
the
hart
began
to
tire
and
its
rider
drooped
their
own
steeds
panted
and
their
dogs
tongues
lolled
but
over
the
dells
and
rises
woods
and
fields
they
still
pressed
on
exulting
that
they
of
all
the
hunt
remained
to
bring
the
weary
gallant
thing
to
bay
once
more
they
were
in
the
home
country
and
the
day
was
drawing
to
a
glorious
close
in
the
great
woods
of
rewell
the
hart
tried
to
confuse
the
scent
and
conceal
itself
with
its
spent
comrade
but
it
was
too
late
for
it
too
was
nearly
spent
yet
it
plunged
forward
to
the
ridge
of
arundel
with
its
high
fret
of
trees
like
filled
with
the
music
of
the
evening
sky
and
here
again
among
the
dipping
valleys
the
quarry
sought
to
shake
off
the
pursuit
but
as
vainly
as
before
in
that
exhausted
close
for
hunters
and
hunted
the
first
had
triumph
to
spur
the
last
of
their
strength
and
the
second
despair
to
eke
out
theirs
at
whiteways
the
hart
struck
down
through
a
secret
dip
into
the
loveliest
hidden
valley
of
all
the
downs
and
descending
after
it
the
knights
saw
suddenly
before
them
a
great
curve
of
the
steely
river
lying
under
the
sunset
like
a
scimitar
dyed
with
blood
and
in
a
last
desperate
effort
the
hart
swerved
round
a
narrow
footway
by
the
river
and
disappeared
the
knights
followed
shouting
with
their
baying
dogs
and
the
next
instant
were
struck
mute
with
astonishment
for
the
narrow
wooded
path
by
the
water
suddenly
swung
open
into
a
towering
of
dazzling
cliffs
uprising
like
the
loftiest
castle
upon
earth
such
castles
as
heaven
builds
of
gigantic
clouds
to
scatter
their
solid
piles
with
a
wind
again
but
only
the
hurricanes
of
the
first
day
or
the
last
could
bring
this
mighty
pile
to
dissolution
the
forefront
of
the
vast
theater
was
a
perfect
sward
lying
above
the
water
like
a
green
beyond
and
around
it
small
hills
and
dells
rose
and
fell
in
waves
until
they
reached
the
brink
of
the
great
cliffs
at
the
further
point
of
the
the
narrow
way
by
the
river
began
again
and
steep
woods
came
down
to
the
water
cutting
off
the
north
and
somewhere
hidden
in
the
hemisphere
of
little
hills
the
hart
was
hidden
without
a
path
of
escape
the
men
sprang
from
their
horses
and
followed
the
barking
dogs
across
the
sward
at
the
end
of
it
they
turned
up
a
neck
of
grass
that
coiled
about
a
hollow
like
the
rim
of
a
cup
it
led
to
a
little
plateau
ringed
with
bushes
and
smelling
sweet
of
thyme
at
first
it
seemed
as
though
there
were
no
other
ingress
but
the
dogs
nosed
on
and
pointed
to
an
opening
through
the
thick
growth
on
the
left
and
disappeared
with
hoarse
wild
barks
and
yelps
and
their
masters
made
to
follow
but
at
the
same
instant
they
heard
a
voice
come
from
the
bushes
a
voice
well
known
to
them
but
now
it
was
exhausted
of
its
power
though
not
of
its
anger
this
quarry
and
this
place
it
cried
are
sacred
to
the
proud
rosalind
and
in
her
name
i
warn
you
trespassers
that
you
proceed
at
your
peril
at
this
the
seven
knights
burst
into
laughter
and
one
cried
why
then
it
seems
we
have
brought
the
lady
to
bay
with
the
hart
a
double
quarry
friends
come
for
the
dogs
are
full
of
music
now
and
we
must
see
the
kill
as
they
moved
forward
an
arrow
sped
far
above
their
heads
then
a
second
man
cried
we
could
shoot
into
the
dark
more
surely
than
this
clumsy
marksman
out
of
it
let
us
shoot
among
the
trees
and
give
him
his
deserts
and
after
that
let
nothing
hold
us
from
the
dogs
for
their
voices
turn
the
blood
in
me
to
fire
so
each
man
plucked
an
arrow
from
his
quiver
and
as
he
fitted
it
lo
with
incredible
swiftness
seven
arrows
shot
through
the
air
and
one
by
one
each
arrow
split
in
two
a
the
men
looked
at
their
broken
bows
amazed
and
as
they
looked
at
each
other
the
dogs
stopped
baying
one
by
one
one
of
the
knights
said
breathing
heavily
this
must
be
seen
to
the
man
who
could
shoot
like
this
has
been
playing
with
us
since
midsummer
let
us
come
in
and
call
him
to
account
and
make
him
show
us
his
proud
rosalind
they
made
a
single
movement
towards
the
opening
at
the
same
moment
there
was
a
great
movement
behind
it
and
they
came
face
to
face
with
the
it
stood
at
bay
its
terrible
antlers
lowered
its
eyes
were
as
red
as
rubies
and
the
seven
weaponless
men
stood
rooted
there
and
one
said
where
are
the
dogs
but
they
knew
the
dogs
were
dead
so
they
turned
and
went
out
of
that
place
and
found
their
horses
and
rode
away
and
when
they
had
gone
the
hart
too
turned
again
and
went
slowly
down
a
little
slipping
path
through
the
bushes
and
came
to
the
very
inmost
chamber
of
its
castle
a
round
and
roofless
shrine
walled
half
by
the
cliffs
and
half
by
woods
within
on
the
grass
lay
the
dead
hounds
each
pierced
by
an
arrow
and
on
a
bowlder
near
them
sat
the
rusty
knight
with
drooping
head
and
body
regarding
them
through
the
vizard
he
was
too
weary
to
raise
he
was
exhausted
past
bearing
himself
the
hart
lay
down
beside
him
as
exhausted
as
he
but
a
sound
in
the
forest
that
thickly
clothed
the
cliff
made
both
look
up
and
down
between
the
trees
almost
from
the
height
of
the
cliff
climbed
harding
the
red
hunter
bow
in
hand
he
strode
across
the
little
space
that
divided
them
still
and
stood
over
the
rusty
knight
and
the
white
and
both
might
have
been
petrified
for
neither
stirred
after
a
little
harding
began
to
speak
are
you
satisfied
rusty
knight
said
he
with
what
you
have
done
in
proud
rosalind
honor
the
rusty
knight
did
not
answer
did
ever
lady
have
a
sorrier
champion
harding
laughed
roughly
she
would
have
beggared
herself
to
get
you
a
sword
and
she
got
you
a
sword
the
like
of
which
no
knight
ever
had
before
and
how
have
you
used
it
all
through
a
summer
you
have
brought
laughter
upon
her
she
would
have
beggared
herself
again
to
get
you
a
bow
that
only
a
god
was
worthy
to
draw
and
how
have
you
drawn
it
for
a
month
you
have
drawn
it
to
scorn
of
her
and
of
you
you
have
cried
her
praises
only
to
forfeit
them
you
have
vaunted
her
beauty
and
never
crowned
it
and
what
have
you
got
for
it
the
rusty
knight
was
as
dumb
as
the
dead
harding
stepped
closer
shall
i
tell
you
rusty
knight
what
you
have
got
for
it
last
midsummer
eve
by
the
the
proud
rosalind
forswore
love
if
heaven
would
send
her
a
man
to
strike
a
blow
in
her
name
for
her
fathers
sake
she
did
not
say
what
sort
of
man
or
what
sort
of
blow
she
asked
in
her
simplicity
only
that
a
blow
should
be
struck
and
like
a
woman
she
was
ready
to
find
it
enough
and
in
gratitude
repay
it
with
that
which
could
only
in
honor
be
exchanged
for
what
honored
her
yet
i
myself
heard
her
swear
to
hold
herself
bound
to
the
sorry
champion
who
should
strike
for
her
in
the
tourney
and
you
struck
and
fell
did
you
tell
her
you
fell
when
you
came
to
her
crownless
and
how
did
she
crown
you
for
your
fall
rusty
knight
the
knight
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stood
quivering
that
moves
you
said
harding
but
i
will
move
you
more
the
proud
rosalind
is
not
your
woman
she
is
mine
she
was
mine
from
the
moment
her
eyes
fell
she
was
only
a
child
then
but
i
knew
she
was
mine
as
surely
as
i
knew
this
hart
was
mine
and
no
other
when
first
i
saw
it
as
a
calf
drink
at
its
pool
but
i
was
patient
and
waited
till
he
my
calf
should
become
a
king
and
she
my
heifer
a
queen
and
i
am
her
man
because
i
am
of
king
stock
in
my
own
land
and
she
of
stock
in
hers
and
i
am
her
man
because
for
a
year
i
have
kept
her
without
her
knowledge
with
the
pence
i
earned
by
my
sweat
that
were
earned
for
a
different
purpose
and
i
am
her
man
because
the
hart
you
have
defended
so
ill
and
hampered
for
a
month
was
saved
by
my
arrows
not
yours
it
was
my
arrows
slew
the
hounds
from
the
top
of
the
cliff
it
was
my
arrows
split
the
bows
of
the
seven
knights
and
it
is
my
arrow
now
that
will
kill
the
white
hart
that
in
all
men
sight
i
may
give
her
the
antlers
and
hear
my
proud
rosalind
called
queen
among
women
and
as
he
spoke
harding
drew
back
suddenly
and
fitted
a
shaft
to
his
string
as
though
he
would
shoot
the
hart
where
it
lay
but
the
rusty
knight
sprang
forward
and
caught
his
hands
crying
not
my
hart
you
shall
not
shoot
my
hart
and
he
tore
off
his
casque
and
the
great
tawny
mantle
of
rosalind
hair
fell
over
her
rags
and
her
face
was
on
fire
and
her
bosom
heaving
and
she
sank
down
murmuring
i
beg
you
to
spare
my
hart
but
harding
uttering
a
great
laugh
of
pride
and
joy
caught
her
up
before
she
could
kneel
saying
not
even
to
me
my
proud
rosalind
and
without
even
kissing
her
lips
he
put
her
from
him
and
knelt
before
her
and
kissed
her
feet
will
you
be
so
good
mistress
jane
said
martin
as
to
sew
on
my
button
i
will
not
knot
my
thread
master
pippin
said
jane
till
you
have
snapped
yours
it
is
snapped
said
martin
the
story
is
done
joscelyn
it
is
too
much
it
is
too
much
you
do
it
on
purpose
martin
oh
mistress
joscelyn
i
never
do
anything
on
purpose
and
therefore
i
am
always
doing
either
too
much
or
too
little
but
in
what
have
i
exceeded
my
story
i
am
sorry
if
it
is
too
long
joscelyn
it
was
too
short
and
you
are
quibbling
martin
i
but
never
mind
what
more
can
i
say
it
is
a
fault
i
know
but
as
soon
as
my
lovers
understand
each
other
i
can
see
no
further
joscelyn
there
are
a
thousand
things
more
you
can
say
who
this
harding
was
for
one
joyce
and
what
he
meant
by
saying
his
pennies
had
kept
her
for
another
jennifer
and
for
what
other
purpose
he
had
intended
them
jessica
and
you
must
describe
all
that
happened
at
the
last
tourney
jane
and
what
about
the
ring
and
the
girdle
and
the
circlet
and
the
silver
gown
i
would
so
like
to
know
said
little
joan
if
harding
and
rosalind
lived
happily
ever
after
please
wo
you
tell
us
how
it
all
ended
will
women
never
see
what
lies
under
their
noses
groaned
martin
will
they
always
stare
over
a
wall
and
if
they
not
tall
enough
to
try
to
stare
through
it
will
they
only
know
that
a
thing
has
come
to
its
end
when
they
see
it
making
a
new
beginning
why
after
the
first
kiss
all
tales
start
afresh
though
they
start
on
the
second
which
is
as
different
from
the
first
as
a
garden
rose
from
a
wild
one
here
have
i
galloped
you
to
a
conclusion
and
now
you
would
set
me
ambling
again
then
make
up
your
mind
to
it
said
joscelyn
and
amble
dear
heaven
went
on
martin
i
begin
to
believe
that
when
a
woman
is
being
kissed
she
does
even
notice
it
for
thinking
how
sweet
it
will
be
when
he
kisses
me
next
tuesday
fortnight
then
get
on
to
tuesday
fortnight
scolded
joscelyn
if
that
be
the
end
the
end
indeed
said
martin
on
tuesday
fortnight
at
the
very
instant
the
slippery
creature
is
thinking
how
delicious
it
was
when
he
kissed
me
two
weeks
ago
last
saturday
there
no
end
with
a
woman
either
backwards
or
forwards
for
goodness
sake
cried
joscelyn
stop
grumbling
and
get
on
with
it
there
no
end
to
a
man
grumbling
either
said
martin
but
get
on
with
it
the
tale
that
harding
had
to
tell
proud
rosalind
was
a
long
one
but
i
will
make
as
short
of
it
as
i
can
he
told
her
how
in
his
own
country
he
was
sprung
of
the
race
of
volundr
who
was
a
god
and
a
king
and
a
smith
all
in
one
but
he
had
been
and
banished
and
had
since
haunted
england
where
men
knew
him
as
wayland
and
he
did
miracles
but
in
his
own
northern
land
his
strain
continued
until
harding
father
a
king
himself
was
like
his
ancestor
defeated
and
banished
and
crossed
the
water
with
his
young
son
and
a
chest
of
relics
of
old
wayland
work
a
ring
a
girdle
a
crown
and
a
silver
robe
a
sword
and
bow
which
rosalind
knew
already
and
other
things
as
well
and
the
boy
grew
up
filled
with
the
ancient
wrongs
of
his
ancestor
and
he
went
about
the
country
seeking
wayland
haunts
and
wherever
he
found
them
he
found
a
mossy
legend
neglected
and
unproved
of
how
the
god
worked
or
had
worked
for
any
man
pence
and
put
his
divine
craft
to
laborers
service
and
as
in
rosalind
the
dream
had
grown
of
building
up
her
fathers
honor
again
so
harding
had
from
boyhood
nursed
his
dream
of
establishing
that
of
the
god
and
he
who
had
inherited
his
ancestor
craft
in
metal
coming
at
last
through
sussex
settled
at
bury
where
the
legend
lay
on
its
and
he
set
up
his
shop
by
the
ferry
so
that
he
might
doctor
it
and
there
he
did
his
work
in
two
ways
for
as
the
red
smith
he
did
such
work
as
might
be
done
better
by
a
hundred
men
but
as
wayland
he
did
what
could
only
have
been
done
better
by
the
god
and
the
toll
he
collected
for
that
work
he
saved
till
he
should
have
enough
to
build
the
god
a
shrine
and
leaving
this
visible
evidence
behind
him
he
meant
to
depart
to
his
own
land
and
let
the
faith
in
wayland
wax
of
itself
and
then
harding
told
rosalind
how
he
had
first
seen
the
hart
when
it
was
a
calf
six
years
before
at
midsummer
and
how
it
had
led
him
to
the
and
he
had
marked
it
for
his
own
and
how
in
the
same
year
he
had
first
noticed
rosalind
a
girl
not
yet
sixteen
and
for
the
fire
of
kings
in
her
that
all
her
poverty
could
not
extinguish
chosen
her
for
his
mate
and
year
by
year
said
harding
i
watched
to
see
whether
the
direst
want
could
bring
you
to
humbleness
and
saw
you
only
grow
in
nobleness
and
year
by
year
i
lay
in
wait
for
my
quarry
each
midsummer
eve
beside
the
and
saw
it
grow
in
kingliness
and
last
year
as
you
know
i
saw
you
come
to
the
pool
beside
the
hart
and
heard
you
make
your
high
prayer
for
life
or
death
and
if
i
had
not
been
able
to
give
you
the
life
i
would
have
given
you
the
death
you
prayed
for
but
i
went
before
you
and
going
by
the
ferry
put
my
old
god
money
in
your
room
before
you
could
be
there
and
from
time
to
time
i
robbed
his
store
to
keep
you
but
when
in
spring
they
drove
you
from
the
castle
i
did
not
know
where
to
find
you
and
i
hunted
for
your
lair
as
i
hunted
for
the
hart
and
never
knew
they
were
the
same
then
this
year
came
the
again
and
lying
hidden
i
heard
you
cry
for
a
man
to
strike
for
you
and
i
was
tempted
then
to
reveal
myself
and
make
you
know
to
what
man
you
were
committed
but
i
decided
that
i
would
wait
and
strike
for
you
in
the
tourney
and
come
to
you
for
the
first
time
with
a
crown
and
so
i
went
back
to
the
ferry
and
set
to
work
and
to
my
amazement
you
followed
me
and
for
the
first
time
of
your
own
will
addressed
me
i
wondered
whether
you
had
come
to
be
humble
before
your
time
and
if
you
had
been
i
would
have
let
you
go
for
ever
but
when
you
spoke
with
scorn
as
to
a
servant
who
had
once
forgotten
himself
so
far
as
to
play
the
man
to
you
i
laughed
in
my
heart
and
prized
your
scorn
more
dearly
than
your
favor
and
said
to
myself
she
shall
know
me
for
her
man
but
when
you
went
down
to
the
water
and
made
your
demand
of
wayland
for
his
sake
and
yours
i
was
ready
to
give
you
a
weapon
worthy
of
your
steel
so
i
gave
you
the
god
own
sword
and
waited
to
see
what
use
you
would
make
of
it
and
you
made
as
ill
an
use
as
after
you
made
of
the
god
bow
and
while
men
spoke
betwixt
wrath
and
mockery
of
the
rusty
knight
i
loved
more
dearly
that
champion
who
was
doing
so
ill
so
bravely
for
a
championless
lady
then
harding
looked
her
steadily
in
the
eyes
and
though
her
face
was
all
on
fire
again
as
he
alone
had
power
to
make
it
she
did
not
flinch
from
his
gaze
and
he
took
her
hand
and
said
no
man
has
ever
struck
a
blow
for
you
yet
proud
rosalind
but
the
rusty
knight
will
strike
for
you
and
as
there
was
no
marksman
so
there
shall
be
no
swordsman
who
can
match
him
and
when
he
has
won
the
crown
of
sussex
for
you
you
shall
redeem
your
pledge
of
the
and
give
him
what
he
will
till
then
be
free
and
he
dropped
her
hand
again
and
let
her
go
she
turned
and
went
quickly
into
the
bushes
and
soon
she
came
out
bearing
the
miserable
arms
of
the
rusty
knight
and
the
glorious
sword
these
are
all
that
were
in
my
fathers
castle
for
many
years
she
said
and
i
took
them
when
i
went
away
and
the
white
hart
brought
me
to
his
own
castle
but
though
these
are
big
for
me
they
will
be
small
for
you
and
harding
looked
at
them
and
laughed
his
short
laugh
the
casque
alone
will
serve
he
said
by
that
and
the
sword
men
shall
know
me
i
have
my
own
arms
else
and
i
will
take
on
myself
the
shame
of
this
ludicrous
casque
and
redeem
it
in
your
name
and
you
shall
have
these
in
exchange
and
he
handed
her
his
pouch
and
bade
her
what
to
do
in
the
morning
and
went
away
he
still
had
not
kissed
her
mouth
nor
had
she
offered
it
now
there
is
very
little
left
to
tell
on
the
morrow
when
the
roll
of
knights
had
been
called
all
eyes
instinctively
turned
to
the
great
gateway
by
which
the
rusty
knight
had
always
come
at
the
last
moment
and
as
they
looked
they
saw
whom
they
expected
but
not
what
they
expected
for
though
his
head
was
hidden
in
the
rusty
casque
and
though
he
held
the
sword
which
all
men
covet
he
was
clad
from
neck
to
foot
in
arms
and
mail
so
marvelously
chased
and
inwrought
with
red
gold
that
his
whole
body
shone
ruddy
in
the
sunshaft
and
men
and
women
dazzled
and
confused
wondered
what
trick
of
light
made
him
appear
more
tall
and
broad
than
they
remembered
him
so
that
he
seemed
to
dwarf
all
other
men
the
murmur
and
the
doubt
went
round
is
it
the
rusty
knight
then
in
a
voice
of
thunder
he
replied
ay
if
you
will
it
is
the
rusty
knight
or
the
red
knight
or
the
knight
of
the
royal
heart
or
of
the
but
by
any
name
the
knight
of
the
proud
rosalind
who
is
the
proudest
and
most
peerless
of
all
the
maids
of
sussex
as
this
day
work
shall
prove
and
none
laughed
the
joust
began
and
before
the
rusty
knight
the
rest
went
down
like
corn
beaten
by
hail
and
all
men
marveled
at
him
and
all
women
likewise
and
the
young
queen
maudlin
of
bramber
a
prey
to
her
whims
loved
him
as
long
as
the
tourney
lasted
and
when
it
was
ended
and
he
alone
stood
upright
she
rose
in
her
seat
and
held
out
to
him
the
crown
of
gold
and
flowers
upon
a
silken
pillow
crying
you
have
won
this
you
unknown
unseen
champion
and
it
is
your
right
to
give
it
where
you
will
and
none
will
dispute
her
supremacy
in
beauty
for
ever
and
as
he
strode
and
knelt
to
receive
the
crown
she
added
quickly
and
i
know
not
whether
the
promise
has
reached
your
ears
which
yesterday
was
made
that
she
who
accepts
the
crown
is
to
wed
the
victor
although
he
choose
the
queen
herself
to
wear
it
and
she
smiled
down
at
him
like
morning
smiling
out
of
the
sky
and
her
beauty
was
such
as
to
make
a
man
forget
all
other
beauty
and
all
resolutions
but
harding
took
the
crown
from
her
and
touched
her
hand
with
the
rusty
brow
of
his
casque
and
said
a
queen
will
wear
it
for
my
lady
fathers
were
once
kings
of
amberley
then
maudlin
stamped
her
foot
as
a
butterfly
might
and
cried
where
is
this
lady
whom
you
keep
as
hidden
as
your
face
and
harding
rose
and
turned
towards
the
gateway
and
all
turned
with
him
and
into
the
arch
rode
rosalind
on
the
white
hart
and
she
was
clothed
from
her
neck
to
the
soles
of
her
naked
feet
in
a
sheath
of
silver
that
seemed
molded
to
her
lovely
body
and
about
her
waist
a
golden
girdle
hung
set
with
green
stones
and
from
her
finger
a
great
emerald
shot
green
fire
and
on
her
head
a
golden
fillet
lay
in
the
likeness
of
leaves
with
clusters
of
gleaming
green
berries
that
were
other
emeralds
and
under
it
her
glory
of
hair
fell
like
liquid
metal
down
her
back
and
over
the
hart
neck
as
low
as
her
silver
hem
and
the
hart
with
its
splendid
antlers
stood
motionless
and
proud
as
though
it
knew
it
carried
a
young
queen
but
indeed
men
wondered
whether
it
were
not
a
young
goddess
and
so
for
a
very
few
moments
this
carven
vision
of
gold
and
silver
and
ivory
and
molten
bronze
and
copper
and
green
jewels
stood
in
their
gaze
and
then
harding
bore
the
crown
to
her
and
knelt
and
stood
up
again
and
crowned
her
before
them
all
and
laying
his
hand
upon
the
white
hart
neck
moved
away
with
it
and
its
beautiful
rider
through
the
gateway
and
no
one
moved
or
spoke
or
tried
to
stop
them
but
by
the
footway
over
the
they
went
and
at
the
river
edge
found
harding
broad
flat
boat
with
the
bird
beak
and
harding
said
will
you
come
over
the
ferry
with
me
proud
rosalind
and
rosalind
answered
what
is
your
fee
red
boatman
then
harding
answered
for
that
which
flows
i
take
only
that
which
flows
and
rosalind
stooping
of
her
own
accord
from
the
white
hart
back
kissed
him
i
shall
be
very
uncomfortable
mistress
jane
till
you
have
sewed
on
my
button
fifth
interlude
the
milkmaids
had
not
thought
of
their
apples
for
the
last
hour
but
now
remembering
them
they
fell
to
refreshing
their
tongues
with
the
sweet
flavors
of
fruit
and
talk
jessica
i
can
not
rest
jane
till
you
have
pronounced
upon
this
story
jane
i
never
found
pronouncement
harder
jessica
for
who
can
pronounce
upon
anything
but
a
plain
truth
or
a
plain
falsehood
and
i
am
too
confused
to
extricate
either
from
such
a
of
magic
as
came
to
pass
without
the
help
of
any
real
magician
martin
oh
mistress
jane
are
you
sure
of
that
did
not
wishes
come
true
and
can
there
be
magic
without
a
magician
jane
her
wishes
came
true
i
know
both
by
the
pool
and
by
the
ferry
but
that
the
pool
and
the
ferry
were
supernatural
remains
unproved
because
in
both
cases
her
wishes
were
brought
about
by
a
man
and
if
there
was
any
other
magician
at
all
you
never
showed
him
to
us
martin
dear
mistress
jane
where
were
your
eyes
i
showed
you
the
greatest
of
all
the
magicians
that
give
ear
to
the
wishes
of
women
and
when
it
is
necessary
to
bring
them
about
he
puts
his
power
on
a
man
and
the
man
makes
them
come
true
which
is
a
magic
you
must
often
have
noticed
in
men
though
you
may
never
have
known
the
magician
name
joscelyn
we
have
never
noticed
any
magic
whatever
in
men
and
we
want
to
know
the
magician
name
we
do
believe
in
anything
so
silly
as
magic
martin
i
hope
mistress
joscelyn
there
were
moments
in
my
story
not
too
silly
to
be
believed
in
joscelyn
silliness
in
stories
is
more
or
less
excusable
since
they
are
not
even
supposed
to
be
believed
and
is
there
still
a
on
rewell
and
a
ferry
at
bury
martin
the
ferry
is
there
but
harding
hammer
is
silent
and
where
his
shop
stood
is
a
little
cottage
where
children
live
who
dabble
in
summer
on
the
and
their
mother
will
run
from
her
washing
or
cooking
to
take
you
over
the
water
for
the
same
fee
that
wayland
asked
for
shoeing
a
poor
man
donkey
or
making
a
rich
man
sword
and
this
is
the
only
miracle
men
call
for
from
those
banks
and
if
ever
you
tried
to
take
a
boat
across
the
bury
currents
you
would
not
only
believe
in
miracles
but
pray
for
one
while
your
boat
turned
in
like
a
so
there
no
doubt
that
the
is
a
witch
but
as
for
the
it
is
as
lost
as
it
was
before
the
white
hart
led
two
lovers
to
discover
it
at
separate
times
and
having
brought
them
together
passed
with
them
and
its
secret
out
of
men
knowledge
for
neither
it
nor
harding
nor
rosalind
was
seen
again
in
sussex
after
that
day
and
yet
i
can
tell
you
this
much
of
their
fortunes
that
whatever
befell
them
wherever
they
wandered
he
was
a
king
and
she
a
queen
in
the
sight
of
the
whole
world
which
to
all
lovers
consists
of
one
woman
and
one
man
and
their
lives
were
crowned
lives
and
they
carried
their
crown
with
them
even
when
they
came
in
the
same
hour
to
exchange
one
life
for
another
but
this
was
only
a
long
and
cloudless
reign
on
earth
jane
well
it
is
a
satisfaction
to
know
that
for
at
certain
times
your
story
seemed
so
overshadowed
with
clouds
that
i
was
filled
with
doubts
joan
oh
but
jane
even
when
we
walk
in
the
thickest
clouds
on
the
downs
we
are
certain
that
presently
some
light
will
melt
them
or
some
wind
blow
them
away
joyce
yes
it
never
once
occurred
to
me
to
doubt
the
end
of
the
story
jennifer
nor
to
me
and
so
the
clouds
only
kept
one
in
a
delicious
palpitation
at
which
one
could
secretly
smile
without
having
to
stop
trembling
jessica
was
it
possible
jane
that
you
could
be
deceived
as
to
the
conclusion
of
this
why
even
i
saw
joy
coming
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
martin
and
i
with
love
for
its
bearer
for
that
magician
who
touches
the
plainest
things
with
a
radiance
makes
plain
girls
and
boys
look
queens
and
kings
and
plain
staves
flowering
branches
of
joy
and
in
this
case
i
can
think
of
only
one
catastrophe
that
could
have
obscured
or
distorted
that
vision
two
of
the
milkmaids
what
catastrophe
pray
martin
if
rosalind
had
refused
to
believe
in
anything
so
silly
as
magic
the
silence
of
the
seven
sleepers
hung
over
the
joscelyn
then
she
would
have
proved
herself
a
girl
of
sense
singer
and
your
tale
would
have
gained
in
virtue
as
it
stands
i
should
not
have
grieved
though
the
clouds
had
never
been
dispersed
from
so
foolish
a
medley
of
magic
and
martin
so
be
it
if
it
must
be
so
we
will
push
back
our
lovers
into
their
obscurities
and
praise
night
for
the
round
moon
above
us
who
has
pushed
three
parts
of
her
circle
clear
of
all
obstacles
and
awaits
only
some
movement
of
heaven
to
blow
the
last
remnant
of
cloud
from
her
happy
soul
and
because
more
of
her
is
now
in
the
light
than
in
the
dark
she
knows
it
is
only
a
question
of
time
but
the
last
hours
of
waiting
are
always
the
longest
and
we
like
herself
can
do
no
better
than
spend
them
in
dreams
where
if
we
are
lucky
we
shall
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
angels
of
truth
like
the
last
five
leaves
blown
from
an
autumn
branch
the
milkmaids
fluttered
from
the
and
couched
their
sleepy
heads
on
their
tired
arms
and
went
each
by
herself
into
her
particular
dream
where
if
she
found
company
or
not
she
never
told
but
jane
sat
prim
and
thoughtful
with
her
elbow
in
her
hand
and
her
finger
making
a
dimple
in
her
cheek
considering
deeply
and
presently
martin
began
to
cough
a
little
and
then
a
little
more
and
finally
so
troublesomely
that
she
was
obliged
to
lay
her
profound
thoughts
aside
to
attend
to
him
with
a
little
frown
was
even
euclid
impervious
to
midges
have
you
taken
cold
master
pippin
said
jane
i
afraid
so
he
confessed
humbly
for
we
all
know
that
when
we
catch
cold
the
grievance
is
not
ours
but
our
nurse
how
did
it
happen
demanded
jane
rightly
affronted
have
you
been
getting
your
feet
wet
in
the
duckpond
again
the
trouble
lies
higher
murmured
martin
and
held
his
shirt
together
at
the
throat
jane
looked
at
him
and
colored
and
said
that
is
the
merest
pretense
it
was
only
one
button
and
it
is
a
very
warm
night
i
think
you
must
be
mistaken
about
your
cold
perhaps
i
am
said
martin
hopefully
and
you
only
coughed
and
coughed
and
kept
on
coughing
continued
jane
because
i
had
forgotten
all
about
you
and
was
thinking
of
something
quite
different
it
is
almost
impossible
to
deceive
you
said
martin
oh
master
pippin
said
jane
earnestly
since
i
turned
seventeen
i
have
seen
into
people
motives
so
clearly
that
i
often
wish
i
did
not
but
i
can
not
help
it
martin
you
poor
darling
jane
you
must
not
say
that
word
to
me
master
pippin
martin
it
was
very
wrong
of
me
the
word
slipped
out
by
mistake
i
meant
to
say
clever
not
poor
jane
did
you
i
see
oh
but
martin
please
do
be
modest
we
must
always
stand
by
the
truth
do
you
think
jane
above
all
things
martin
how
long
did
it
take
you
to
discover
my
paltry
ruse
how
long
did
you
hear
me
coughing
jane
from
the
very
beginning
martin
and
can
you
think
of
two
things
at
once
jane
of
course
not
martin
no
i
wish
two
was
the
least
number
of
things
i
ever
think
of
at
once
mine
an
untidy
way
of
thinking
still
now
we
know
where
we
are
what
were
you
thinking
about
me
so
earnestly
when
i
was
coughing
and
you
had
forgotten
all
about
me
jane
i
i
i
was
thinking
about
you
at
all
and
she
got
down
from
the
swing
and
walked
away
martin
now
we
do
know
where
we
are
and
he
got
down
from
the
branch
and
walked
after
her
martin
please
mistress
jane
are
you
in
a
temper
jane
i
am
never
in
a
temper
martin
hurrah
jane
being
in
a
temper
is
silly
it
is
normal
and
it
clouds
people
judgments
martin
so
do
lots
of
things
do
they
like
leapfrog
and
mad
bulls
and
rum
punch
and
very
full
moons
and
love
jane
all
these
things
are
as
you
say
abnormal
and
i
have
no
more
use
for
them
than
i
have
for
tempers
but
being
disheartened
being
in
a
temper
and
i
am
always
disheartened
when
people
argue
badly
and
above
all
men
who
i
find
can
never
keep
to
the
point
although
they
say
martin
what
do
they
say
jane
that
girls
ca
martin
began
to
cough
again
and
jane
looked
at
him
closely
and
martin
apologized
and
said
it
was
that
tickle
in
his
throat
and
jane
said
gravely
do
you
think
i
ca
see
through
you
come
along
do
and
opened
her
housewife
and
put
on
her
thimble
and
threaded
her
needle
and
got
out
the
button
and
made
martin
stand
in
a
patch
of
moonlight
and
stood
herself
in
front
of
him
and
took
the
neck
of
his
shirt
deftly
between
her
left
finger
and
thumb
and
began
to
stitch
and
martin
looking
down
on
the
top
of
her
smooth
little
head
which
was
all
he
could
see
of
her
said
anxiously
you
wo
prick
me
will
you
and
jane
answered
i
try
not
to
but
it
is
very
awkward
because
to
get
behind
the
button
she
had
to
lean
her
right
elbow
on
his
shoulder
and
stand
a
little
on
tiptoe
so
that
martin
had
good
cause
to
be
frightened
but
after
several
stitches
he
realized
that
he
was
in
safe
hands
and
drew
a
big
breath
of
relief
which
made
jane
look
up
rather
too
hastily
and
down
more
hastily
still
so
that
her
hand
shook
and
the
needle
slipped
and
martin
said
ow
and
clutched
the
hand
with
the
needle
and
held
it
tightly
just
where
it
was
and
jane
got
flustered
and
said
i
so
sorry
martin
why
should
you
be
you
proved
your
point
if
i
knew
any
man
that
could
stick
to
his
so
well
and
drive
it
home
so
truly
i
would
excuse
him
for
ever
from
politics
and
the
law
and
bid
him
sit
at
home
with
his
minding
the
world
business
in
its
cradle
it
is
only
because
men
can
not
stick
to
the
point
that
life
puts
them
off
with
the
little
jobs
which
shift
and
change
color
with
every
generation
but
the
great
point
of
life
which
never
changes
was
given
from
the
first
into
woman
keeping
because
as
all
the
divine
powers
of
reason
knew
only
she
could
be
trusted
to
stick
to
it
i
should
be
glad
to
have
your
opinion
jane
as
to
whether
this
is
true
or
not
jane
yes
martin
i
am
convinced
it
is
true
martin
then
let
the
men
as
much
as
they
like
and
so
as
long
as
the
cradle
is
there
to
be
minded
we
shall
have
proved
that
out
of
two
differences
unions
can
spring
my
buttonhole
feels
empty
what
about
my
button
jane
i
was
just
about
to
break
off
the
thread
when
you
martin
when
i
what
jane
sighed
martin
was
it
a
sigh
did
i
sigh
how
unreasonable
of
me
what
was
i
sighing
for
do
you
know
jane
of
course
i
know
martin
will
you
tell
me
jane
that
enough
and
she
tried
to
break
off
the
thread
martin
ah
but
you
must
keep
your
wisdom
to
yourself
give
me
the
key
dear
jane
jane
the
key
martin
because
how
else
can
the
clouds
which
overshadow
our
stories
be
cleared
away
how
else
can
we
allay
our
doubts
and
our
confusions
and
our
sorrows
if
you
who
are
wise
and
see
motives
so
clearly
will
not
give
us
the
key
why
did
i
sigh
jane
and
why
does
gillian
sigh
and
oh
jane
why
are
you
sighing
do
you
know
jane
of
course
i
know
martin
and
wo
you
give
me
the
key
jane
that
quite
enough
and
this
time
she
broke
off
the
thread
and
she
put
the
needle
in
and
out
of
the
pinked
flannel
in
her
housewife
and
she
tucked
the
thimble
in
its
place
and
then
she
felt
in
a
little
pocket
where
something
clinked
against
her
scissors
and
martin
watched
her
and
she
took
it
out
and
put
it
in
his
hand
and
his
hand
tightened
again
over
hers
and
he
said
gravely
is
it
a
needle
no
it
is
not
said
jane
primly
but
it
very
much
to
the
point
oh
you
wise
woman
whispered
martin
and
jane
colored
with
satisfaction
because
she
was
turned
seventeen
what
would
poor
men
do
without
your
help
then
he
kissed
very
respectfully
the
hand
that
had
pricked
him
on
the
back
and
on
the
palm
and
on
the
four
fingers
and
thumb
and
on
the
wrist
and
then
he
began
looking
for
a
new
place
but
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
jane
had
taken
her
hand
and
herself
away
saying
good
night
very
politely
as
she
went
so
he
lay
down
to
dream
that
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
made
up
his
mind
but
jane
whose
mind
was
always
made
up
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
dreamed
otherwise
it
happened
that
by
some
imprudence
martin
had
laid
himself
down
exactly
under
the
gap
in
the
hedge
and
when
old
gillman
came
along
the
other
side
crying
maids
in
the
morning
the
careless
fellow
had
no
time
to
retreat
across
the
open
to
safe
cover
so
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
conceal
himself
under
the
very
nose
of
danger
and
roll
into
the
ditch
which
he
hurriedly
did
while
the
milkmaids
ran
here
and
there
like
yellow
chickens
frightened
by
a
hawk
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
they
at
last
clustered
above
him
about
the
gap
filling
it
so
with
their
pretty
faces
that
the
farmer
found
room
for
not
so
much
as
an
eyelash
when
he
arrived
with
his
bread
and
it
was
for
all
the
world
as
though
the
hedge
forgetting
it
was
autumn
had
broken
out
at
that
particular
spot
into
may
so
that
even
old
gillman
had
no
fault
to
find
with
the
arrangement
all
astir
my
maids
said
he
yes
master
yes
they
answered
breathlessly
all
but
joscelyn
who
cried
oh
oh
oh
and
bit
her
lip
hard
and
stood
suddenly
on
one
foot
what
amiss
with
ye
asked
gillman
nothing
master
said
she
very
red
in
the
face
a
nettle
stung
my
ankle
well
i
not
weep
for
t
said
gillman
indeed
i
not
weeping
cried
joscelyn
loudly
then
it
did
but
tickle
ye
i
doubt
said
gillman
slyly
to
master
i
am
not
blushing
protested
joscelyn
the
sun
on
my
face
and
in
my
eyes
do
you
see
i
would
he
were
on
my
daughter
then
said
gillman
does
gillian
still
sit
in
her
own
shadow
yes
master
answered
jane
but
i
think
she
will
be
in
the
light
very
shortly
if
she
be
not
groaned
gillman
it
a
shadow
she
find
instead
of
a
father
when
she
comes
back
to
the
farmstead
for
who
can
sow
wild
oats
at
my
time
o
life
and
not
show
it
at
last
in
his
frame
yet
i
was
a
stout
man
once
take
heart
master
urged
joyce
eyeing
his
waistcoat
but
he
shook
his
head
do
be
deceived
maid
drink
makes
neither
flesh
nor
gristle
only
inflation
gillian
he
shouted
when
will
ye
make
the
best
of
a
bad
job
and
a
solid
man
of
your
dad
again
but
the
donkey
braying
in
its
paddock
got
as
much
answer
as
he
well
it
lean
days
for
all
maids
said
gillman
and
doled
out
the
loaves
from
his
basket
and
you
must
suffer
even
as
i
yet
another
day
may
see
us
grow
fat
and
he
turned
his
basket
upside
down
on
his
head
and
moved
away
excuse
me
master
said
jane
but
is
nellie
my
little
dexter
kerry
doing
nicely
as
nicely
as
she
ever
does
with
any
man
said
gillman
which
is
to
kick
john
twice
a
day
mornings
and
evenings
he
say
he
getting
used
to
it
and
will
miss
it
when
you
come
back
to
manage
her
but
before
that
happens
i
misdoubt
we
all
be
plunged
in
rack
and
ruin
and
he
departed
making
his
usual
i
getting
fond
of
old
gillman
said
martin
sitting
up
and
picking
dead
leaves
out
of
his
hair
i
like
his
hawker
cry
of
maids
maids
maids
for
all
the
world
as
though
he
had
pretty
girls
to
sell
and
i
like
the
way
he
groans
regrets
over
his
empty
basket
as
he
goes
away
but
if
i
had
those
wares
for
market
i
ask
such
unfair
prices
for
them
that
i
never
be
out
of
stock
what
an
unfair
price
for
a
pretty
girl
master
pippin
asked
jessica
it
varies
said
martin
joan
i
not
sell
for
less
than
an
apple
or
joyce
for
a
hair
i
might
accept
a
blade
of
grass
for
jennifer
and
be
tempted
by
a
button
for
jane
you
jessica
i
rate
as
high
as
a
saucy
answer
simple
fees
all
laughed
joyce
not
so
simple
said
martin
for
it
must
be
the
right
apple
and
the
particular
hair
only
one
of
all
the
in
the
world
will
do
and
it
must
be
a
certain
button
or
none
also
there
are
answers
and
answers
in
that
case
said
jessica
i
afraid
you
got
us
all
on
your
hands
for
ever
but
at
what
price
would
you
sell
joscelyn
at
nothing
less
said
martin
than
a
yellow
joscelyn
stamped
her
left
foot
so
furiously
that
her
shoe
came
off
and
little
joan
anxious
to
restore
peace
ran
and
picked
it
up
for
her
and
said
why
joscelyn
you
lost
your
lace
where
can
it
be
but
joscelyn
only
looked
angrier
still
and
went
without
answering
to
set
gillian
bread
by
the
where
she
found
nothing
whatever
but
a
little
crust
of
yesterday
loaf
and
surprised
out
of
her
vexation
she
ran
back
again
exclaiming
look
look
as
surely
as
gillian
is
finding
her
appetite
i
think
she
is
losing
her
grief
the
argument
is
as
absolute
said
martin
as
that
if
we
do
not
soon
breakfast
my
appetite
will
become
my
grief
but
those
miserable
ducks
and
he
snatched
the
crust
from
joscelyn
hand
and
flung
it
mightily
into
the
pond
where
the
drake
gobbled
it
whole
and
the
ducks
got
nothing
and
the
girls
cried
what
a
shame
and
burst
out
laughing
all
but
joscelyn
who
said
under
her
breath
to
martin
give
it
back
at
once
but
he
did
seem
to
hear
her
and
raced
the
others
gayly
to
the
tree
where
they
always
picnicked
and
they
all
fell
to
in
such
good
spirits
that
joscelyn
looked
from
one
to
another
very
doubtfully
and
suddenly
felt
left
out
in
the
cold
and
she
came
slowly
and
sat
down
not
quite
in
the
circle
and
kept
her
left
foot
under
her
all
the
time
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
jennifer
sighed
i
wish
it
were
what
a
greedy
wish
said
martin
and
then
said
she
i
wish
it
were
why
said
he
because
it
would
be
nearer
said
jennifer
pensively
do
you
want
it
to
be
so
much
asked
martin
and
five
of
the
milkmaids
cried
oh
yes
that
better
than
wanting
it
to
be
yesterday
said
martin
yet
always
so
pleased
with
that
i
never
want
it
to
be
either
and
as
for
old
time
i
read
him
by
a
dial
which
makes
it
any
hour
i
choose
what
dial
that
asked
joyce
and
martin
looked
about
for
a
dandelion
clock
and
having
found
one
blew
it
all
away
with
a
single
puff
and
cried
one
and
then
jennifer
got
a
second
puff
and
blew
on
it
so
carefully
that
she
was
able
to
say
seven
and
and
then
all
the
girls
hastened
to
get
clocks
of
their
own
and
make
their
favorite
time
when
i
ca
make
it
come
right
confided
little
joan
to
martin
i
pull
them
off
and
say
six
in
the
morning
it
a
very
good
way
agreed
martin
and
six
in
the
morning
is
a
very
good
hour
except
for
lazy
is
it
nancy
always
looked
for
me
at
six
of
a
summer
morning
said
little
joan
yes
said
martin
milkmaids
must
always
turn
their
cows
in
before
the
dew
dry
and
carters
their
horses
sometimes
they
get
so
mixed
in
the
lane
said
joan
i
am
sure
they
do
said
martin
how
glad
your
cows
will
be
to
see
you
all
again
are
you
certain
we
shall
be
out
of
the
orchard
master
pippin
asked
jane
heaven
help
us
otherwise
said
he
for
i
but
one
tale
left
in
my
quiver
and
if
it
does
not
make
an
end
of
the
job
here
we
must
stay
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
puffing
time
away
in
gossamer
then
jessica
blowing
cried
four
come
in
to
tea
and
joyce
said
twelve
baste
the
goose
in
the
oven
three
change
your
frock
said
jane
eight
postman
knock
said
jennifer
ten
to
bed
to
bed
cried
jessica
again
nine
let
me
run
down
the
lane
for
a
moment
first
begged
little
joan
then
martin
blew
eighteen
and
said
it
was
six
tomorrow
morning
and
all
the
girls
clapped
their
hands
for
joy
all
except
joscelyn
who
sat
quite
by
herself
in
a
corner
of
the
orchard
and
neither
blew
nor
listened
and
so
they
continued
to
change
the
hour
and
the
occupation
now
washing
now
wringing
now
drying
now
milking
now
baking
now
mending
now
cooking
their
meal
now
eating
it
now
strolling
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
now
going
to
market
on
till
by
dinner
they
had
filled
the
morning
with
a
week
of
hours
and
the
air
with
downy
seedlings
as
exquisite
as
crystals
of
frost
at
dinner
the
maids
ate
very
little
and
jessica
said
i
think
getting
tired
of
bread
and
apples
said
martin
one
never
gets
tired
of
apples
said
jessica
but
i
would
like
to
have
them
roasted
for
a
change
with
cream
or
in
a
dumpling
with
brown
sugar
and
instead
of
bread
i
would
like
what
would
i
give
for
a
bowl
of
curds
and
whey
exclaimed
joyce
fruit
salad
and
custard
is
nice
sighed
jennifer
i
could
fancy
a
lemon
cheesecake
observed
jane
or
a
jam
tart
i
should
like
said
little
joan
the
best
of
all
so
it
is
said
martin
you
always
have
to
suck
your
fingers
afterwards
said
joan
that
why
said
martin
quince
jelly
is
good
too
and
treacle
because
if
you
quick
you
can
write
your
name
in
it
and
picked
walnuts
and
mushrooms
and
strawberries
and
green
salad
and
eggs
and
cherries
are
ripping
especially
in
earrings
and
macaroons
and
cheesestraws
and
gingerbread
and
stop
stop
stop
stop
stop
cried
the
milkmaids
i
can
hardly
bear
it
myself
said
martin
let
play
so
the
maids
rolled
up
a
log
from
one
part
of
the
orchard
and
martin
got
a
plank
from
another
part
because
the
orchard
was
full
of
all
manner
of
things
as
well
as
girls
and
apples
and
he
straddled
one
end
and
said
who
first
and
jessica
straddled
the
other
as
quick
as
a
boy
and
went
up
with
a
whoop
but
joyce
who
presently
turned
her
off
sat
sideways
as
gay
and
graceful
as
a
lady
in
a
circus
and
jennifer
crouched
a
little
and
clung
rather
hard
with
her
hands
but
laughed
bravely
all
the
time
and
jane
thought
she
would
and
then
she
thought
she
would
and
squeaked
when
she
went
up
and
fell
off
when
she
came
down
so
that
martin
tumbled
too
and
apologized
to
her
earnestly
for
his
clumsiness
and
while
he
rubbed
his
elbows
she
said
it
matter
at
all
but
little
joan
took
off
her
shoes
and
with
her
hands
behind
her
head
stood
on
the
end
of
the
as
lightly
as
a
sunray
standing
on
a
wave
and
she
looked
up
and
down
at
martin
half
shyly
because
she
was
afraid
she
was
showing
off
and
half
smiling
because
she
was
happy
as
a
bird
and
joscelyn
would
play
then
the
girls
told
martin
he
had
more
than
his
share
and
made
him
get
off
and
struggled
for
possession
of
the
like
kings
of
the
castle
and
martin
strolled
up
to
joscelyn
and
said
persuasively
it
such
fun
but
joscelyn
only
frowned
and
answered
give
it
back
to
me
and
martin
did
seem
to
understand
her
and
returned
to
the
and
suggested
three
a
side
and
he
would
look
after
jane
very
carefully
so
he
and
jane
and
jennifer
got
on
one
end
and
jessica
joyce
and
joan
sat
on
the
other
and
screaming
and
laughing
they
tossed
like
a
boat
on
a
choppy
sea
until
jessica
without
any
warning
jumped
off
her
perch
in
and
destroyed
the
balance
and
down
they
all
came
laughing
and
screaming
more
than
ever
but
jane
reproved
jessica
for
her
trick
and
said
nobody
would
believe
her
another
time
and
that
it
was
a
bad
thing
to
destroy
confidence
in
you
and
jessica
wiped
her
hot
face
on
her
sleeve
and
said
she
was
awfully
sorry
because
she
admired
jane
more
than
anybody
else
in
the
world
then
martin
looked
at
the
sun
and
said
barely
time
to
get
tidy
for
supper
so
the
milkmaids
ran
off
to
smooth
their
hair
and
their
kerchiefs
and
do
up
ribbons
and
buttons
or
whatever
else
was
necessary
and
came
fresh
and
rosy
to
their
meal
of
which
not
one
of
them
could
touch
a
morsel
she
declared
dear
dear
dear
said
martin
anxiously
what
the
matter
with
you
all
but
they
really
did
know
they
just
were
hungry
so
please
would
he
tell
them
a
story
this
will
never
do
said
martin
i
shall
have
you
ill
on
my
hands
an
apple
apiece
or
no
story
at
this
dreadful
threat
joan
plucked
the
nearest
apple
she
could
find
which
was
luckily
a
cox
pippin
must
i
eat
it
all
martin
she
asked
and
joscelyn
looked
at
her
quickly
with
that
doubtful
look
which
had
been
growing
on
her
all
day
all
but
the
skin
said
martin
kindly
and
taking
the
apple
from
her
he
peeled
it
cleverly
from
bud
to
stem
and
handed
her
back
nothing
but
the
peel
and
she
twirled
the
peel
three
times
round
her
head
and
dropped
it
in
the
grass
behind
her
what
is
it
what
is
it
cried
the
milkmaids
crowding
it
a
c
said
martin
and
he
gave
joan
her
apple
and
she
ate
it
then
joyce
came
to
martin
with
a
beauty
of
bath
and
he
peeled
it
as
he
had
joan
and
withheld
the
fruit
until
she
had
performed
her
rite
and
her
letter
was
jennifer
brought
a
worcester
pearmain
and
threw
a
and
jessica
chose
a
curlytail
and
made
a
perfect
o
and
jane
who
preferred
a
russet
threw
her
own
initial
and
martin
said
seriously
you
to
be
an
old
maid
jane
and
joscelyn
looked
at
him
and
jane
replied
i
do
see
that
at
all
there
are
lots
of
lots
of
j
martin
and
joscelyn
looked
at
her
then
martin
turned
inquiringly
to
joscelyn
and
she
said
i
do
want
one
no
stories
then
said
martin
as
firm
as
nurse
at
bedtime
and
she
shook
her
shoulders
impatiently
but
he
himself
picked
her
a
king
of
pippins
the
biggest
and
reddest
in
the
orchard
and
peeled
it
like
the
rest
and
gave
her
the
peel
and
very
crossly
she
jerked
it
thrice
round
her
head
so
that
it
broke
into
three
bits
and
they
fell
on
the
grass
in
the
shape
of
an
agitated
and
martin
gave
her
also
her
pippin
but
what
about
your
own
supper
said
little
joan
and
martin
glancing
from
one
to
another
gathered
a
cox
a
beauty
a
pearmain
a
curlytail
a
russet
and
a
king
of
pippins
and
he
peeled
and
ate
them
one
after
another
and
then
one
after
another
whirled
the
parings
and
every
one
of
the
parings
was
a
j
then
while
martin
stood
looking
down
at
the
six
j
among
the
and
the
milkmaids
looked
anywhere
else
and
said
nothing
little
joan
slipped
away
and
came
back
with
the
smallest
prettiest
and
rosiest
lady
apple
in
gillman
orchard
and
said
softly
this
one
for
you
so
martin
pared
it
slenderly
and
the
peel
lay
in
his
hand
like
a
ribbon
of
silk
shot
with
gold
and
he
coiled
it
lightly
three
times
round
his
head
and
dropped
it
over
his
left
shoulder
and
as
suddenly
as
bubbles
sucked
into
the
heart
of
a
little
whirlpool
the
milkmaids
ran
to
get
a
look
at
the
letter
but
martin
looked
first
and
when
the
ring
of
girls
stood
round
about
him
he
put
his
foot
quickly
on
the
and
rubbed
it
into
the
grass
and
without
even
tasting
it
he
tossed
his
little
lady
apple
right
over
the
wicket
and
beyond
the
duckpond
and
for
all
the
girls
could
see
to
adversane
then
jane
and
jessica
and
jennifer
and
joyce
and
little
joan
as
by
a
single
instinct
each
climbed
to
a
bough
of
the
center
and
left
the
swing
empty
and
martin
sat
on
his
own
bough
and
waited
for
joscelyn
and
very
slowly
she
came
and
sat
on
the
swing
and
said
without
looking
at
him
we
all
ready
now
all
said
martin
and
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
where
it
made
no
difference
most
of
us
anyhow
said
joscelyn
and
whoever
is
ready
is
nearly
ready
yet
most
is
not
all
and
nearly
is
not
quite
said
martin
and
would
you
be
satisfied
if
i
could
only
tell
you
most
of
my
story
and
was
obliged
to
break
off
when
it
was
nearly
done
alas
with
me
it
must
be
the
whole
or
nothing
and
i
can
not
make
a
beginning
unless
i
can
see
the
end
all
beginnings
must
have
endings
said
joscelyn
so
begin
at
once
and
the
end
will
follow
of
itself
yet
suppose
it
were
some
other
end
than
i
set
out
for
said
martin
there
no
telling
with
these
endings
that
go
of
themselves
we
mean
one
thing
but
they
mistake
our
meaning
and
show
us
another
like
the
simple
maid
who
was
sent
to
fetch
her
lady
slippers
and
her
smock
and
brought
the
wrong
ones
she
must
have
been
some
ignorant
maid
from
a
town
said
jane
if
she
did
not
know
and
when
she
saw
them
it
was
either
her
mistake
or
her
lady
said
martin
carelessly
you
shall
judge
which
and
he
tuned
his
lute
and
still
looking
at
the
sang
the
lady
sat
in
a
flood
of
tears
all
of
her
sweet
eyes
shedding
the
paths
of
sorrow
are
the
paths
that
i
be
treading
so
she
sent
her
lass
for
her
slippers
of
black
but
the
careless
lass
came
running
back
with
slippers
as
bright
as
fairy
gold
or
noonday
light
that
were
heeled
and
soled
to
dance
in
at
a
wedding
the
lady
sat
in
a
storm
of
sighs
raised
by
her
own
must
i
in
the
churchyard
lie
because
love
is
an
urchin
so
she
sent
her
lass
for
her
sable
frock
but
the
silly
lass
brought
a
silken
smock
so
fair
to
be
seen
with
a
rosy
shade
and
a
lavender
sheen
that
was
only
made
for
a
bride
to
come
from
church
in
now
as
martin
sang
gillian
got
first
on
her
elbow
and
then
on
her
knees
and
last
upright
on
her
two
feet
and
her
face
was
turned
full
on
the
duckpond
and
her
eyes
gazed
as
though
she
could
see
more
and
further
than
any
other
woman
in
the
world
and
her
two
hands
held
her
heart
as
though
but
for
this
it
must
follow
her
eyes
and
be
lost
to
her
for
ever
so
far
as
i
can
see
said
joscelyn
there
nothing
to
choose
between
the
foolishness
of
the
maid
and
that
of
the
mistress
but
since
gillian
appears
to
have
risen
to
some
sense
in
it
for
goodness
sake
before
she
sinks
back
on
her
own
folly
tell
us
your
tale
and
be
done
with
it
it
is
ready
now
said
martin
from
start
to
finish
glass
is
not
clearer
nor
daylight
plainer
to
me
than
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
and
if
you
will
listen
for
a
very
few
instants
you
shall
see
as
certainly
as
i
the
ending
of
the
imprisoned
princess
the
imprisoned
princess
there
was
once
dear
maidens
a
princess
who
was
kept
on
an
island
joscelyn
there
are
no
islands
in
sussex
martin
this
did
happen
in
sussex
joscelyn
but
i
thought
it
was
a
true
story
martin
it
is
the
only
true
story
of
them
all
she
was
kept
on
the
island
locked
up
in
a
tower
for
the
best
of
all
the
reasons
in
the
world
she
had
fallen
in
love
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
father
squire
so
the
king
banished
him
for
ever
and
locked
up
his
daughter
in
a
tower
on
an
island
and
had
it
guarded
by
six
gorgons
joscelyn
it
not
a
true
story
martin
it
is
a
true
story
if
you
do
say
so
at
the
end
i
give
you
joscelyn
what
i
do
want
you
to
give
me
anything
martin
all
right
then
joscelyn
what
will
you
give
me
martin
a
yellow
by
six
gorgons
repeated
martin
who
had
the
sharpest
claws
and
the
snakiest
hair
of
any
gorgons
there
ever
were
and
their
faces
joscelyn
leave
their
faces
alone
martin
you
being
a
perfect
nuisance
joscelyn
i
simply
hate
this
story
martin
tell
it
yourself
then
joscelyn
what
about
their
faces
their
faces
said
martin
were
as
beautiful
as
day
and
night
and
the
four
seasons
of
the
year
they
were
so
beautiful
that
i
must
stop
talking
about
them
or
i
shall
never
talk
about
anything
else
so
better
talk
about
the
young
squire
who
was
a
great
deal
less
interesting
except
for
one
thing
that
he
was
in
love
which
is
a
big
advantage
to
have
over
gorgons
who
never
are
the
only
other
noteworthy
thing
about
him
was
that
his
voice
was
breaking
because
he
was
merely
fifteen
years
old
he
was
just
a
sort
of
odd
boy
about
the
king
court
martin
mistress
joscelyn
if
you
keep
on
wiggling
so
much
you
get
a
nasty
tumble
kindly
sit
still
and
let
me
get
on
this
is
a
very
long
story
one
morning
in
april
this
squire
sat
down
at
the
end
of
the
world
and
he
sobbed
and
he
sighed
like
any
poor
soul
and
a
sort
of
wandering
fellow
who
was
going
by
had
enough
curiosity
to
stop
and
ask
him
what
was
the
matter
and
the
squire
told
him
and
added
that
his
heart
was
breaking
for
longing
of
the
flower
that
his
lady
wore
in
her
hair
so
this
fellow
said
is
that
all
and
he
got
into
his
boat
which
had
a
painted
prow
and
a
light
green
pennon
and
a
gilded
sail
and
called
itself
the
golden
truant
and
he
sailed
away
a
thousand
leagues
over
the
water
till
he
came
to
the
island
where
the
princess
was
imprisoned
and
the
six
gorgons
came
hissing
to
the
shore
and
asked
him
what
he
wanted
and
he
said
he
wanted
nothing
but
to
play
and
sing
to
them
so
they
let
him
and
while
he
did
so
they
danced
and
forgot
and
he
ran
to
the
tower
and
found
the
princess
with
her
beautiful
head
bowed
on
the
windowsill
behind
the
bars
weeping
like
january
rain
and
he
climbed
up
the
wall
and
took
from
her
hair
the
flower
as
she
wept
in
exchange
for
another
which
which
the
squire
had
sent
her
and
she
whispered
a
word
of
sorrow
and
he
another
of
comfort
and
came
away
and
the
gorgons
suspected
nothing
except
perhaps
the
littlest
gorgon
and
she
looked
the
other
way
so
in
the
summer
the
squire
told
the
wanderer
that
he
would
surely
die
unless
he
had
his
lady
ring
to
kiss
and
the
fellow
went
again
to
the
island
the
gorgons
were
not
sorry
to
see
him
and
were
willing
to
dance
while
he
played
and
sang
as
before
and
as
before
he
took
advantage
of
their
pleasure
and
stole
the
gold
ring
from
the
princess
hand
as
she
lay
in
tears
behind
her
bars
but
in
place
of
the
gold
ring
he
left
a
silver
one
which
had
belonged
to
to
the
squire
and
the
voice
of
her
despair
spoke
through
her
tears
and
he
answered
it
as
best
he
could
with
the
voice
of
hope
and
went
away
as
before
leaving
the
gorgons
dancing
then
in
the
autumn
the
squire
said
to
the
wanderer
who
can
live
on
flowers
and
rings
if
you
do
not
get
me
my
lady
herself
let
me
lie
in
my
grave
so
the
wanderer
set
sail
for
the
third
time
though
he
knew
that
the
dangers
and
difficulties
of
this
last
adventure
were
supreme
and
once
more
he
landed
on
the
island
of
the
imprisoned
princess
and
this
time
the
gorgons
even
appeared
a
little
pleased
to
see
him
and
let
him
stay
with
them
six
days
and
nights
telling
them
stories
and
singing
them
songs
and
inventing
games
to
keep
them
amused
for
he
was
very
sorry
for
them
joscelyn
why
why
why
martin
because
he
discovered
that
they
were
even
unhappier
than
the
princess
in
her
tower
joscelyn
it
is
true
it
is
true
martin
look
out
you
losing
your
slipper
of
course
the
gorgons
were
unhappier
than
the
princess
she
was
only
parted
from
her
lover
but
they
were
parted
from
love
itself
but
as
the
week
wore
on
miracles
happened
for
every
night
one
of
the
gorgons
turned
into
the
beautiful
girl
she
used
to
be
before
the
goddess
of
reason
infuriated
with
the
irrational
god
who
bestows
on
girls
their
quite
unreasonable
loveliness
had
made
her
what
she
was
and
night
by
night
the
wanderer
rubbed
his
eyes
and
wondered
if
he
had
been
dreaming
for
the
guardians
of
the
tower
no
longer
hissed
but
sighed
at
love
and
instead
of
claws
for
the
destructions
of
lovers
had
beautiful
kind
hands
that
longed
to
help
them
until
on
the
sixth
night
only
one
remained
this
fellow
enemy
but
alas
she
was
the
strongest
and
fiercest
of
them
all
joscelyn
how
dare
you
and
her
case
said
martin
was
hopeless
because
she
alone
of
them
all
had
never
known
what
love
was
and
so
had
nothing
to
be
restored
to
joscelyn
how
dare
you
and
without
her
said
martin
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
she
had
always
had
the
others
under
her
thumb
and
by
this
time
she
had
the
wanderer
in
exactly
the
same
place
and
so
and
so
and
so
here
is
your
mistress
joscelyn
and
i
am
sorry
the
want
of
it
has
been
such
an
inconvenience
to
you
all
day
so
that
you
could
not
make
merry
with
us
but
i
must
forfeit
it
now
for
the
story
is
ended
and
i
think
you
must
own
it
is
true
joscelyn
i
wo
take
it
the
story
is
not
true
the
story
is
not
ended
finish
it
at
once
none
of
the
others
ended
like
this
martin
the
others
were
true
joscelyn
i
do
care
you
are
to
say
what
happened
to
the
gorgons
joyce
and
to
the
squire
jennifer
and
to
the
princess
jessica
and
what
she
looked
like
jane
and
what
happened
to
the
king
please
martin
said
little
joan
please
do
let
the
story
come
to
an
end
before
we
know
what
happened
to
the
wanderer
i
tired
of
telling
stories
said
martin
and
i
never
tell
another
as
long
as
i
live
but
i
suppose
i
must
add
the
trimmings
to
this
one
or
i
shall
get
no
peace
all
these
things
dear
maidens
are
very
quickly
told
except
what
the
princess
looked
like
for
that
is
impossible
no
man
ever
knew
he
never
got
further
than
her
eyes
and
then
he
was
drowned
but
what
does
it
matter
how
she
looked
she
died
a
thousand
years
ago
of
a
broken
heart
and
her
squire
hearing
of
her
death
died
too
a
thousand
leagues
away
and
the
king
her
father
expired
of
remorse
and
his
country
went
to
rack
and
ruin
and
the
five
kind
gorgons
had
to
pay
the
penalty
of
their
regained
humanity
and
wilted
into
their
maiden
graves
only
the
sixth
gorgon
lived
on
for
ever
and
ever
i
dare
not
think
of
her
solitary
eternity
but
as
for
the
wanderer
he
is
of
no
importance
a
little
while
he
still
went
wandering
singing
these
lovers
sorrows
to
the
world
and
what
became
of
him
i
never
knew
that
the
end
and
now
dear
mistress
joscelyn
let
me
lace
up
your
shoe
joscelyn
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
burst
out
crying
postlude
part
i
there
was
consternation
in
the
all
the
milkmaids
came
tumbling
from
their
perches
to
run
and
comfort
their
weeping
comrade
and
as
they
passed
martin
joyce
cried
it
a
shame
and
jennifer
murmured
how
could
you
and
jessica
exclaimed
you
brute
and
jane
said
i
surprised
at
you
and
even
little
joan
shook
her
head
at
him
and
while
all
the
others
fondled
joscelyn
and
petted
and
consoled
her
took
her
hand
and
held
it
very
tight
but
with
her
other
hand
she
took
martin
and
held
it
just
as
tight
and
looked
a
little
anxious
with
tears
in
her
blue
eyes
yet
she
looked
a
little
smiling
too
and
there
were
tears
also
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
milkmaids
because
the
story
had
ended
so
badly
and
because
they
did
not
in
the
least
know
what
was
going
to
happen
and
because
a
man
had
made
one
of
them
cry
and
martin
suddenly
realized
that
all
these
girls
were
against
him
as
much
as
though
it
were
six
months
ago
and
he
swung
his
feet
and
looked
as
though
he
did
care
so
that
joan
knew
he
was
feeling
rather
sheepish
inside
and
held
his
hand
a
little
tighter
then
joscelyn
who
had
the
loveliest
brown
as
joan
had
the
loveliest
blue
eyes
in
england
lifted
her
young
head
and
looked
at
martin
so
defiantly
through
her
tears
that
he
knew
she
had
given
up
the
game
at
last
and
he
pressed
joan
hand
for
all
he
was
worth
and
began
to
look
ashamed
of
himself
so
that
joan
knew
he
had
stopped
feeling
sheepish
in
the
least
and
joscelyn
in
a
voice
that
shook
like
said
i
do
want
it
to
end
like
that
martin
dear
mistress
joscelyn
is
it
my
fault
i
promised
you
the
truth
and
with
your
help
i
have
told
it
joscelyn
how
dare
you
say
it
with
my
help
if
i
had
my
way
martin
you
shall
have
it
we
will
leave
the
end
of
the
story
in
your
hands
joscelyn
i
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
it
martin
then
i
afraid
it
your
fault
joscelyn
that
what
a
man
always
says
martin
did
he
joscelyn
yes
he
did
he
said
it
was
eve
fault
martin
so
it
was
joscelyn
how
dare
you
martin
he
said
nothing
but
the
truth
and
what
did
you
say
joscelyn
i
said
it
was
adam
fault
martin
so
it
was
you
said
nothing
but
the
truth
joscelyn
how
could
it
be
two
people
fault
martin
how
could
it
be
anything
else
oh
joscelyn
there
are
two
things
in
this
world
that
one
person
alone
can
not
bring
to
perfection
and
one
of
them
is
a
fault
it
takes
two
people
to
make
a
perfect
fault
eve
tempted
adam
and
adam
was
jolly
glad
to
get
tempted
if
he
was
half
as
sensible
as
he
ought
to
have
been
and
eve
knew
it
and
adam
let
her
know
it
and
if
after
that
she
had
not
tempted
him
he
would
never
have
forgiven
her
when
it
came
to
they
understood
each
other
perfectly
and
between
them
they
made
the
most
perfect
fault
in
the
world
joscelyn
after
a
very
long
pause
you
said
there
were
two
things
martin
two
things
joscelyn
that
one
person
alone
ca
bring
to
perfection
martin
did
i
joscelyn
what
is
the
other
thing
martin
love
is
it
joscelyn
how
dare
you
ask
me
martin
i
dare
ask
more
than
that
joscelyn
how
old
are
you
joscelyn
i
tell
you
martin
joscelyn
you
are
the
tallest
of
the
milkmaids
but
you
help
that
how
old
are
you
joscelyn
mind
your
own
business
martin
joscelyn
the
first
three
times
i
saw
you
you
had
your
hair
down
your
back
but
ever
since
i
told
you
my
first
story
you
have
done
it
up
like
beautiful
dark
flowers
on
each
side
of
your
head
and
it
is
my
belief
that
you
have
no
business
to
have
it
up
at
all
joscelyn
very
angrily
how
dare
you
of
course
i
have
am
i
not
nearly
sixteen
martin
nearly
joscelyn
well
next
june
martin
oh
hebe
it
worse
than
i
thought
how
dare
i
you
how
dare
you
have
us
all
under
your
thumb
how
dare
you
play
the
gorgon
to
gillian
how
dare
you
cry
your
eyes
out
because
my
lovers
had
an
unhappy
ending
go
back
to
your
what
does
sixteen
next
june
know
about
adam
what
does
sixteen
next
june
know
about
love
joscelyn
everything
how
dare
you
everything
martin
am
i
to
believe
you
then
by
all
you
know
you
baby
give
me
the
sixth
key
of
the
and
he
took
from
his
pocket
the
five
keys
he
already
had
and
held
out
his
hand
for
the
last
one
joscelyn
eyes
grew
bigger
and
bigger
and
the
doubt
that
had
troubled
her
all
day
became
a
certainty
as
she
looked
from
the
keys
to
her
comrades
who
all
got
very
red
and
hung
their
heads
why
did
you
give
them
up
demanded
joscelyn
because
martin
answered
for
them
they
know
everything
about
love
but
then
they
are
all
more
than
sixteen
years
of
age
and
capable
of
making
the
right
sort
of
ending
which
is
so
impossible
to
children
like
you
and
me
then
joscelyn
looked
as
old
as
she
could
and
said
not
so
impossible
master
pippin
if
if
but
all
of
a
sudden
she
began
to
laugh
it
was
the
first
time
martin
had
ever
heard
her
laugh
or
her
comrades
for
six
months
their
faces
cleared
like
magic
and
they
all
clapped
their
hands
and
ran
away
and
martin
got
down
from
his
bough
because
when
joscelyn
laughed
she
did
look
more
than
fourteen
if
what
joscelyn
he
said
if
you
stolen
the
right
martin
said
she
and
she
stuck
out
her
right
foot
with
its
yellow
slipper
then
martin
knelt
down
and
instead
of
lacing
the
left
shoe
unlaced
the
right
one
and
inside
the
yellow
slipper
found
the
sixth
key
just
under
the
instep
is
that
the
right
ending
said
joscelyn
and
martin
held
the
little
foot
in
his
hands
rubbing
it
gently
and
said
compassionately
it
must
have
been
dreadfully
uncomfortable
it
was
sometimes
said
joscelyn
did
it
hurt
asked
martin
beginning
to
lace
up
her
shoes
for
her
now
and
then
said
joscelyn
it
was
an
awfully
kiddish
place
to
hide
it
in
said
martin
finishing
and
as
he
looked
up
joscelyn
laughed
again
rubbing
her
cheeks
with
the
back
of
her
hand
and
for
all
the
great
growing
girl
that
she
was
looked
no
more
than
twelve
so
he
slid
under
the
swing
and
stood
up
behind
her
and
kissed
her
on
the
back
of
the
neck
where
babies
are
kissed
then
all
the
milkmaids
came
back
again
part
ii
to
every
girl
martin
handed
her
key
this
is
your
business
said
he
and
first
joan
and
next
joyce
and
then
jennifer
and
then
jessica
and
then
jane
and
last
of
all
joscelyn
put
her
key
into
its
lock
and
turned
and
not
one
of
the
keys
would
turn
they
bit
their
lips
and
held
their
breath
and
turned
and
turned
in
vain
this
is
dreadful
said
martin
are
you
sure
the
keys
are
in
the
right
keyholes
they
all
fit
said
little
joan
let
me
try
said
martin
and
he
tried
one
after
another
and
then
tried
each
key
singly
in
each
lock
but
without
result
jane
said
i
expect
they
gone
rusty
and
jessica
said
that
must
be
it
and
jennifer
turned
pale
and
said
then
gillian
can
never
get
out
of
the
or
we
out
of
the
orchard
and
martin
sat
down
in
the
swing
and
thought
and
thought
as
he
thought
he
began
to
swing
a
little
and
then
a
little
more
and
suddenly
he
cried
push
me
and
the
six
girls
came
behind
him
and
pushed
with
all
their
strength
up
he
went
with
his
legs
pointed
as
straight
as
an
arrow
and
back
he
flew
and
up
again
the
third
time
the
swing
flew
clean
over
the
and
as
true
as
a
diving
gannet
martin
dropped
from
into
the
little
court
and
stood
face
to
face
with
gillian
part
iii
she
was
not
weeping
she
was
bathed
in
blushes
and
laughter
she
held
out
her
hands
to
him
and
martin
took
them
she
had
golden
hair
of
lights
and
shadows
like
a
wheatfield
that
fell
in
two
thick
plaits
over
her
white
gown
and
she
had
gray
eyes
where
smiles
met
you
like
an
invitation
but
you
had
to
learn
later
that
they
were
really
a
little
guard
set
between
you
and
her
inward
tenderness
and
that
her
gayety
like
a
led
you
into
the
flowery
of
her
spirit
where
fairies
played
but
not
to
the
heart
of
it
where
angels
dwelled
few
succeeded
in
surprising
her
behind
her
bright
shield
but
sometimes
when
she
was
thinking
it
fell
aside
and
what
men
saw
then
took
their
breath
from
them
for
it
was
as
though
they
were
falling
through
endless
wells
of
infinite
sweetness
and
afterwards
they
could
have
told
you
nothing
further
of
her
loveliness
when
they
got
as
far
as
her
eyes
they
were
drowned
her
features
the
curves
of
her
cheeks
and
lips
and
chin
and
delicate
nostrils
were
as
as
the
edge
of
a
petal
and
her
skin
had
the
freshness
of
dew
the
sight
of
her
brought
the
same
sense
of
delight
as
the
sight
of
a
meadow
of
cowslips
as
sweet
and
sunny
a
scent
breathed
out
from
her
beauty
but
all
this
martin
only
felt
without
seeing
for
he
was
drowned
gillian
i
suppose
was
thinking
so
they
held
each
other
hands
and
looked
at
each
other
presently
martin
said
it
time
now
gillian
and
you
can
go
yes
martin
said
gillian
how
shall
i
go
as
i
came
said
he
before
i
go
said
she
i
am
going
to
ask
you
a
question
you
have
asked
my
friends
a
lot
of
questions
these
six
nights
which
they
have
answered
frankly
and
you
have
twisted
their
answers
round
your
little
finger
now
you
must
answer
my
question
as
frankly
and
what
will
you
do
asked
martin
i
wo
twist
your
answer
said
gillian
gently
i
take
it
for
what
it
is
worth
you
have
been
laughing
up
your
sleeve
a
little
at
my
friends
because
having
a
quarrel
with
men
they
were
sworn
to
live
single
but
you
live
single
too
tell
me
if
you
please
what
is
your
quarrel
with
girls
martin
dropped
her
hands
until
he
held
each
by
the
little
finger
only
and
then
he
answered
that
they
are
so
much
too
good
for
us
gillian
thank
you
martin
said
gillian
taking
her
hands
away
and
now
please
ask
them
to
send
over
the
swing
for
it
is
time
for
me
to
go
to
adversane
and
as
she
spoke
the
light
played
over
her
eyes
again
and
floated
him
up
to
the
surface
of
things
where
he
could
swim
without
drowning
he
saw
now
the
flowers
of
her
loveliness
but
no
longer
the
deeps
of
those
gray
pools
where
the
light
shimmered
between
herself
and
him
so
he
turned
and
climbed
to
the
pent
roof
of
the
and
looked
towards
the
group
of
shadows
clustered
under
the
around
the
swing
and
they
understood
and
launched
it
through
the
air
and
he
caught
it
as
it
came
and
gillian
in
a
moment
was
up
beside
him
are
you
ready
said
martin
yes
she
answered
getting
on
the
swing
thank
you
and
thank
you
for
everything
thank
you
for
coming
three
times
this
year
thank
you
for
the
stories
thank
you
for
giving
their
happiness
again
to
my
darling
friends
thank
you
for
all
the
songs
thank
you
for
drying
my
tears
are
they
all
dried
up
said
martin
all
said
gillian
if
they
were
not
said
he
you
shall
find
growing
along
the
roadside
and
the
herbman
himself
in
adversane
and
holding
the
swing
fast
as
he
sat
on
the
roof
martin
sang
her
his
last
song
not
very
loud
but
so
clearly
that
the
shadows
under
the
heard
every
note
and
syllable
good
morrow
good
morrow
dear
herbman
robert
good
morrow
sweet
sir
good
morrow
oh
sell
me
a
herb
good
robert
good
robert
to
cure
a
young
maid
of
her
sorrow
and
hath
her
sorrow
a
name
sweet
sir
no
lovelier
name
or
purer
with
its
root
in
her
heart
and
its
flower
in
her
eyes
yet
sell
me
a
herb
shall
cure
her
oh
touch
with
this
rosy
herb
of
spring
both
heart
and
eyes
when
she
sleeping
and
joy
will
come
out
of
her
sorrowing
and
laughter
out
of
her
weeping
martin
gillian
i
want
to
ask
you
a
lot
more
questions
martin
off
you
go
cried
he
and
let
the
swing
fly
back
it
came
martin
why
did
jump
when
you
clear
called
martin
but
back
it
came
why
did
the
young
squire
in
the
story
jump
this
time
and
back
it
come
to
fetch
her
himself
martin
jump
shouted
martin
and
shut
his
eyes
and
put
his
hands
over
his
ears
but
it
was
no
use
again
and
again
he
felt
the
rush
of
air
and
questions
falling
through
it
like
about
his
head
martin
what
was
the
name
on
the
eighth
floret
of
grass
martin
what
was
the
letter
you
threw
with
the
martin
why
is
my
silver
ring
all
chased
with
little
apples
martin
do
you
do
you
do
you
shall
i
never
be
rid
of
this
swing
cried
martin
jump
you
nuisance
jump
when
i
tell
you
and
she
jumped
and
was
caught
and
kissed
among
the
shadows
gillian
gillian
gillian
gillian
gillian
dear
gillian
and
then
like
a
golden
wave
and
she
the
foam
they
bore
her
over
the
moonlit
grass
to
the
green
wicket
and
they
threw
it
open
and
she
went
like
a
skipping
stone
across
the
duckpond
and
over
the
fields
to
adversane
when
she
had
vanished
martin
slid
down
the
roof
walked
across
to
the
coping
put
one
leg
over
and
stepped
out
of
the
part
iv
the
six
milkmaids
were
waiting
for
him
in
the
no
joscelyn
was
in
the
swing
and
so
said
martin
sitting
down
on
the
bough
on
the
sixth
night
the
sixth
gorgon
also
became
a
maiden
as
lovely
as
her
fellows
and
gave
the
wanderer
the
sixth
key
to
the
tower
and
they
let
out
the
princess
and
set
her
in
the
golden
truant
and
she
sailed
away
to
her
squire
a
thousand
leagues
over
the
water
and
everybody
lived
happily
ever
after
what
a
beautiful
story
said
jane
and
they
all
thought
so
too
i
knew
from
the
first
said
joscelyn
that
it
would
have
a
happy
ending
and
so
did
i
said
joyce
and
i
said
jennifer
and
i
said
jessica
and
i
said
jane
and
and
i
said
little
joan
the
verdict
is
passed
said
martin
and
look
over
our
heads
hangs
the
moon
as
round
and
beautiful
as
a
penny
balloon
with
an
eye
as
wide
awake
as
a
child
at
six
in
the
morning
if
she
will
not
go
to
sleep
in
heaven
why
on
earth
should
we
let
have
a
party
the
girls
looked
at
one
another
in
amazement
and
delight
a
party
oh
cried
they
but
who
will
give
it
i
will
said
martin
and
who
will
come
to
it
whoever
luck
sends
us
said
martin
but
we
begin
with
ourselves
joan
and
joyce
and
jennifer
and
jessica
and
jane
and
joscelyn
will
you
come
to
my
party
in
the
yes
thank
you
martin
cried
they
and
ran
away
to
change
but
the
only
change
possible
was
to
take
the
kerchiefs
off
their
white
necks
and
the
shoes
and
stockings
off
their
little
feet
and
let
down
their
pretty
hair
so
they
did
these
things
and
made
wreaths
for
one
another
and
posies
for
their
yellow
dresses
and
it
is
time
for
you
to
know
that
jennifer
dress
was
primrose
and
jane
cowslip
yellow
and
that
joyce
looked
like
buttercups
and
jessica
like
marigolds
and
joscelyn
was
the
glory
of
the
kingcups
that
rise
like
magic
golden
isles
above
the
amberley
floods
in
may
but
little
joan
had
not
been
able
to
decide
between
the
two
yellows
that
go
to
make
wild
daffodils
so
she
had
them
both
under
their
flowerlike
skirts
their
white
ankles
and
rosy
heels
moved
as
lightly
as
windflowers
swaying
in
the
grass
and
just
when
they
were
ready
they
heard
martin
pippin
lute
under
the
so
they
came
to
the
party
dancing
round
and
round
the
tree
they
danced
in
the
moonlight
till
they
were
out
of
breath
but
when
they
could
dance
no
more
they
stood
stock
still
and
stared
without
speaking
for
spread
under
the
trees
was
such
a
feast
as
they
had
not
seen
for
months
and
months
in
the
middle
was
a
great
heap
of
apples
red
and
brown
and
green
and
gold
but
besides
these
was
a
dish
of
roasted
apples
and
another
of
apple
dumplings
and
between
them
a
bowl
of
brown
sugar
and
a
full
pitcher
of
cream
the
cream
had
spilled
and
you
could
see
where
martin
had
run
his
finger
up
the
round
of
the
pitcher
to
its
lip
where
one
drip
lingered
still
near
these
there
was
a
of
the
sort
our
grannies
make
it
is
of
these
cakes
we
say
that
twenty
men
could
not
put
their
arms
round
them
there
were
nuts
in
it
too
and
spices
and
there
was
a
big
basin
of
curds
and
whey
and
a
bigger
one
of
fruit
salad
and
another
of
custard
and
plates
of
jam
tarts
and
lemon
cheesecakes
and
cheesestraws
and
macaroons
and
gingerbread
in
cakes
and
also
in
figures
of
girls
and
boys
with
caraway
comfits
for
eyes
and
a
unicorn
and
a
lion
with
gilded
horn
and
crown
and
pots
of
honey
and
quince
jelly
and
treacle
and
mushrooms
and
pickled
walnuts
and
green
salads
even
ringdaly
did
not
provide
a
bigger
feast
when
he
married
ringdaly
for
there
were
also
all
the
best
sorts
of
sweets
in
the
world
on
a
string
and
twisted
and
and
peardrops
and
licorice
and
turkish
delight
and
pink
and
white
sugar
mice
besides
these
there
was
sherbet
not
to
drink
of
course
but
to
dip
your
finger
in
there
were
a
good
many
other
things
but
these
were
what
the
milkmaids
took
in
at
a
glance
oh
cried
six
voices
at
once
where
did
they
come
from
through
the
gap
said
martin
but
who
brought
them
do
ask
me
said
martin
at
first
the
girls
were
rather
shy
you
ca
help
that
at
parties
but
as
they
ate
and
you
know
what
each
ate
first
they
got
more
and
more
at
their
ease
and
by
the
time
they
were
licking
their
sticky
fingers
were
in
the
mood
for
any
game
so
they
played
all
the
best
games
there
are
such
as
cobbler
cobbler
joscelyn
shoe
and
hunt
the
thimble
jane
thimble
and
mulberry
bush
and
oranges
and
lemons
and
nuts
in
may
and
in
nuts
in
may
martin
insisted
on
being
a
side
all
by
himself
and
one
after
another
he
fetched
each
girl
away
from
her
side
to
his
and
joan
came
like
a
bird
and
joyce
pretended
to
struggle
and
jennifer
had
no
fight
in
her
at
all
and
jessica
really
tried
and
jane
did
like
it
because
it
was
undignified
and
so
rough
but
when
joscelyn
turn
came
to
be
fetched
as
she
stood
all
alone
on
her
side
deserted
by
her
supporters
she
put
her
hands
behind
her
back
and
jumped
over
the
handkerchief
of
her
own
accord
and
walked
up
to
martin
and
said
all
right
you
won
for
when
it
comes
to
fetching
away
it
is
a
game
that
boys
are
better
at
than
girls
in
that
case
said
martin
it
time
for
and
he
sat
down
on
the
swing
and
shut
his
eyes
at
the
same
moment
the
moon
went
behind
a
cloud
and
as
he
waited
a
light
drop
fell
on
martin
cheek
and
another
and
another
like
the
silent
weeping
of
a
girl
so
that
he
could
help
opening
his
eyes
quickly
and
looking
by
instinct
toward
the
empty
it
was
still
empty
for
wherever
the
girls
had
hidden
themselves
it
was
not
there
then
through
the
shadowed
raining
orchard
a
low
voice
called
cuckoo
and
cuckoo
cuckoo
called
another
and
softly
clearly
laughingly
mockingly
defiantly
teasingly
sweetly
caressingly
cuckoo
cuckoo
cuckoo
they
called
on
every
side
martin
stood
up
and
stole
among
the
trees
at
first
he
went
quietly
but
soon
he
ran
and
darted
and
never
a
girl
could
he
find
for
this
after
all
is
the
game
that
girls
are
better
at
than
boys
and
when
it
comes
to
hiding
if
they
will
not
be
found
they
will
not
and
if
they
will
they
will
but
their
will
was
not
for
martin
pippin
through
the
pattering
moonless
orchard
he
hunted
them
in
vain
and
the
place
was
full
of
slipping
shadows
and
whispers
and
every
now
and
then
those
cuckooing
milkmaids
called
him
sometimes
at
a
distance
sometimes
at
his
very
ear
but
he
could
not
catch
a
single
one
and
now
it
seemed
to
martin
that
there
were
more
of
these
elusive
shadows
than
he
could
have
believed
and
whisperings
that
needed
accounting
for
for
once
he
heard
somebody
whisper
oh
you
were
right
the
world
is
flat
for
six
months
it
been
as
flat
as
a
pancake
and
a
second
voice
whispered
then
i
was
wrong
for
pancakes
are
round
and
martin
said
to
himself
that
joyce
but
the
first
voice
he
recognize
and
then
followed
a
sound
that
was
not
exactly
a
whisper
yet
not
exactly
unlike
one
and
martin
darted
towards
it
but
touched
only
air
and
again
he
heard
a
mysterious
voice
whisper
how
could
you
keep
yourself
so
secret
all
these
months
i
could
have
however
can
girls
keep
secrets
so
long
and
the
answer
was
they
ca
keep
them
a
single
instant
if
you
come
and
ask
them
but
you
did
come
what
a
fool
i
was
whispered
the
first
voice
but
whose
martin
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
imagine
yet
he
was
sure
that
the
other
was
jennifer
and
again
he
heard
that
misleading
sound
which
seemed
to
be
something
yet
when
he
sought
it
was
nothing
and
now
he
heard
another
unknown
whisperer
say
you
should
have
seen
my
drills
in
the
wheatfield
last
april
how
the
drill
did
wobble
why
i
was
that
upset
any
girl
could
have
thrown
straighter
than
i
drilled
that
wheat
and
a
second
whisperer
replied
it
must
have
been
a
sight
then
for
girls
throw
crookeder
than
swallows
fly
this
was
surely
jessica
but
who
was
the
first
speaker
he
was
as
strange
to
martin
as
another
one
who
whispered
it
was
the
silence
got
on
my
nerves
most
it
was
having
nobody
to
listen
to
of
an
evening
of
course
there
were
the
lads
but
they
never
talk
to
the
point
i
often
fear
whispered
a
second
voice
that
i
talk
too
much
at
random
good
lord
you
could
if
you
talked
for
ever
each
of
these
two
cases
ended
as
the
first
two
had
ended
and
for
martin
in
as
little
result
he
hastened
to
another
part
of
the
orchard
where
the
whispers
were
falling
fast
and
fierce
it
was
adam
fault
after
all
no
found
out
that
it
was
eve
fault
but
i
been
looking
it
up
and
i
been
thinking
it
over
rubbish
it
was
adam
fault
it
was
not
adam
fault
what
can
a
stupid
little
boy
know
about
it
i
a
month
older
than
you
are
i
do
care
if
you
are
it
was
fault
well
do
make
a
fuss
if
it
was
was
it
stuff
was
it
oh
all
right
if
you
like
it
was
eve
fault
an
apple
for
you
said
joscelyn
quite
distinctly
oh
ripping
but
i
rather
have
a
run
martin
was
just
too
late
rather
have
a
what
said
martin
to
himself
he
was
beginning
to
feel
lonely
his
hair
was
wet
with
rain
he
seen
a
milkmaid
for
an
hour
he
prowled
low
in
the
grass
hoping
to
catch
one
unawares
in
the
swing
he
saw
a
shadow
or
was
it
two
shadows
it
looked
like
one
and
yet
one
half
of
the
shadow
whispered
do
you
like
my
new
corduroys
ever
so
much
whispered
the
other
half
i
rather
bucked
about
them
myself
whispered
the
first
half
or
ought
i
to
say
about
it
i
think
it
them
said
the
second
half
the
first
half
reflected
it
might
be
either
one
thing
or
two
but
arithmetic
a
nuisance
i
never
was
good
at
it
the
second
half
confessed
i
always
have
to
guess
at
it
myself
i
only
really
sure
of
one
bit
which
bit
that
whispered
the
first
half
and
the
second
half
whispered
that
one
and
one
make
two
oh
you
darling
of
course
they
do
and
never
did
and
never
will
well
i
do
really
mind
said
little
joan
and
then
there
was
a
pause
in
which
the
two
shadows
were
certainly
one
until
the
second
half
whispered
oh
oh
you
shaved
it
off
and
this
delighted
the
first
half
beyond
all
bounds
because
even
in
the
circumstances
it
was
clever
of
the
second
half
to
have
noticed
it
but
martin
could
bear
no
more
he
sprang
forward
crying
joan
and
he
grasped
the
empty
swing
and
round
the
orchard
he
flew
his
hands
before
him
calling
now
joyce
now
jane
now
jessica
jennifer
joscelyn
and
again
joan
joan
joan
and
all
his
answer
was
rustlings
and
shadows
and
whispers
and
faint
laughter
like
echoes
and
empty
air
all
of
a
sudden
the
light
rain
stopped
and
the
moon
came
out
of
her
cloud
and
martin
found
himself
standing
beside
the
and
nobody
near
him
he
gazed
all
around
at
the
familiar
things
the
the
swing
the
green
wicket
the
broken
feast
in
the
grass
and
then
at
the
far
end
of
the
orchard
he
saw
an
unfamiliar
thing
it
was
a
double
ladder
arched
over
the
hawthorn
and
up
the
ladder
like
a
golden
shaft
of
the
moon
went
six
quick
girls
and
ahead
of
each
her
lad
and
on
the
topmost
rung
each
took
his
milkmaid
by
the
hand
and
vanished
over
the
hedge
martin
pippin
was
left
alone
in
the
is
not
important
but
their
names
were
michael
tom
oliver
john
henry
and
charles
and
michael
had
dark
hair
and
light
lashes
and
tom
freckles
and
a
and
oliver
a
mole
on
his
left
cheek
and
john
fine
hair
on
his
bronzed
skin
and
henry
was
merely
the
boy
whose
voice
was
breaking
so
he
imagined
that
it
was
he
alone
who
ran
the
farm
but
charles
was
a
dear
he
had
a
tuft
of
white
hair
at
the
back
of
his
dark
head
like
the
of
a
rabbit
and
as
well
as
corduroy
breeches
he
wore
a
waistcoat
and
he
was
a
great
nuisance
to
gamekeepers
who
called
him
a
poacher
whereas
all
he
did
was
to
let
the
rabbits
out
of
the
snares
when
it
was
kind
to
and
destroy
the
snares
and
he
used
the
bring
which
other
people
call
snapdragons
of
the
loveliest
colors
to
plant
in
the
little
garden
known
as
joan
corner
i
should
like
to
tell
you
more
about
charles
but
there
is
time
because
i
am
fond
of
him
if
i
had
been
i
should
have
let
him
have
joan
epilogue
at
cockcrow
came
the
call
which
in
that
orchard
was
now
as
familiar
as
the
rooster
maids
maids
maids
martin
pippin
was
leaning
over
the
green
wicket
throwing
jam
tarts
to
the
ducks
because
in
the
gillian
had
not
left
so
much
as
a
crumb
but
when
he
heard
old
gillman
voice
he
flicked
a
at
the
drake
getting
it
very
accurately
on
the
bill
and
walked
across
to
the
gap
good
morning
master
said
martin
cheerfully
pray
how
does
lemon
joscelyn
sussex
fare
old
gillman
put
down
his
loaves
with
great
deliberation
and
spent
a
few
minutes
taking
martin
in
then
he
answered
there
scant
milk
to
a
sussex
and
allus
will
be
and
if
there
was
not
there
be
none
to
joscelyn
lemon
and
if
there
was
it
would
take
more
than
henry
to
draw
it
and
so
that
you
is
it
that
me
said
martin
pippin
well
said
old
gillman
i
spent
the
best
of
six
mornings
trying
not
to
see
ye
and
has
my
daughter
taken
the
right
road
yet
yes
master
said
martin
she
has
taken
the
road
to
adversane
which
she
spent
the
best
of
six
months
trying
not
to
see
said
old
gillman
women
a
nuisance
allus
for
taking
the
long
cut
round
i
known
many
a
short
cut
said
martin
to
end
in
a
blind
alley
well
well
so
long
as
they
gets
there
grunted
gillman
and
this
here
a
pair
of
steps
said
martin
what
for
said
gillman
milkmaids
and
milkmen
said
martin
so
they
maids
have
cut
too
have
they
it
was
a
full
moon
you
see
i
dessay
but
if
they
gone
by
the
stile
they
could
have
hopped
it
in
the
dark
six
months
agone
said
old
gillman
and
he
got
over
the
stile
which
was
the
other
way
into
the
orchard
and
has
not
been
mentioned
till
now
and
came
and
clapped
martin
on
the
shoulder
women
more
trouble
said
he
than
they
worth
they
plenty
of
trouble
said
martin
i
never
discovered
yet
what
they
worth
we
not
talk
of
em
more
come
up
to
the
house
for
a
drink
boy
said
old
gillman
martin
said
pleasantly
you
can
drink
milk
now
master
to
your
heart
content
or
even
water
and
he
walked
over
to
the
and
pointed
invitingly
to
the
bucket
old
gillman
followed
him
with
one
eye
open
it
too
late
for
that
boy
when
you
turned
toper
for
six
months
after
sixty
sober
years
it
take
you
another
six
to
drop
the
habit
that
what
these
daughters
do
for
their
dads
but
we
not
talk
of
em
he
stood
beside
martin
and
stared
down
at
the
padlock
how
did
the
pretty
go
in
the
swing
like
a
swift
why
not
through
the
gate
like
a
gal
the
keys
would
turn
which
way
the
right
way
you
should
ha
tried
em
the
wrong
way
boy
that
would
have
locked
it
said
martin
azactly
said
old
gillman
and
slipped
the
padlock
from
the
staple
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
come
along
up
now
martin
followed
him
through
the
orchard
and
the
paddock
and
the
garden
and
the
farmyard
to
the
house
he
noticed
that
everything
was
in
the
pink
of
condition
but
as
he
passed
the
stables
he
heard
the
cows
lowing
badly
the
was
a
big
one
it
had
all
the
things
that
go
to
make
the
best
such
as
red
bricks
and
heavy
beams
and
a
deep
hearth
with
a
great
fire
on
it
and
settles
inside
from
which
one
could
look
up
at
the
to
the
sky
and
clay
pipes
and
spills
alongside
and
a
muller
for
wine
or
beer
and
hams
and
sides
of
bacon
and
strings
on
onions
and
bunches
of
herbs
much
pewter
and
a
copper
and
brass
candlesticks
and
a
grandfather
clock
a
cherrywood
dresser
and
wheelback
chairs
polished
with
age
and
a
great
scrubbed
oaken
table
to
seat
a
planed
from
a
single
mighty
plank
it
was
as
clean
as
everything
else
in
that
good
room
but
all
the
scrubbing
would
not
efface
the
circular
stains
wherever
men
had
sat
and
drunk
and
that
was
all
the
way
round
and
in
the
middle
there
were
mugs
and
a
toby
jug
upon
it
now
old
gillman
filled
two
of
the
mugs
and
lifted
one
to
martin
and
martin
echoed
the
action
like
a
and
they
toasted
each
other
in
good
audit
ale
well
said
old
gillman
stuffing
his
pipe
it
been
a
peaceful
time
and
now
us
must
just
see
how
things
go
they
look
shipshape
enough
at
the
moment

martin

old
gillman
shaking
his
head
that

old
gillman
refilled
his
mug

gillman

old
gillman
and
puffed
at
his
pipe

call
her

for
she

said
martin
if

make
up

said
old
gillman
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
turn
em
out

and
crop
till
they
learned
what
they
wanted
and
robin
into
the
bargain
he
no

martin

his
all
along
o

says
the
river
haunted
by
spirits
and
a
mystery
at
the
end
of
it
which
none

ever
come
back
from
and
no
man
dares
hazard
so
dark
and
dangerous
an
adventure
even
for
love
of
the
rose
that

a
pride
to

curtain
while
he
told
men
my
wishes
and
you
be
the
only
one
of
them
all
as
is
willing
to
do
a
difficult
thing

idle
whim

jumps
and

up
her
mouth
gillman
filled
his
mug
martin
filled
his
well
said
he
a
man
must
take
his
bull
by
the
horns
and
did
you
ever
succeed
in
finding
the
murray
river
wi
a
child
help
it
can
only
be
found
by
a
child
help
tis
the
child
river
of
all
sussex
any
child
can
help
you
to
it
yes
said
martin
and
all
children
know
it
old
gillman
put
down
his
mug
do
you
know
it
boy
i
live
by
it
said
martin
pippin
when
i
live
anywhere
do
children
play
in
it
still
asked
gillman
none
but
children
said
martin
pippin
and
above
all
the
child
which
boys
and
girls
are
always
rediscovering
in
each
other
hearts
even
when
they
turned
gray
in
other
folks
sight
and
at
the
end
of
it
is
a
mystery
she
were
a
child
to
the
end
said
old
gillman
a
fair
nuisance
so
she
were
and
jill
takes
after
her
well
she
off
your
hands
anyhow
said
martin
getting
up
she
to
be
some
other
body
nuisance
now
and
your
maids
have
come
back
to
their
milking
ah
have
they
grunted
gillman
the
lads
did
it
better
and
they
cooked
better
and
they
cleaned
better
there
is
nothing
men
can
not
do
better
than
women
i
know
it
said
martin
pippin
but
it
would
be
unkind
to
let
on
then
we
wash
our
hands
of
em
but
do
go
boy
said
old
gillman
talking
of
sloe
gin
martin
sat
down
again
they
talked
of
sloe
gin
for
a
very
long
time
they
did
not
agree
about
it
they
got
out
some
bottles
to
see
if
they
could
not
manage
to
agree
martin
thought
one
bottle
had
enough
in
it
so
they
put
in
some
more
and
old
gillman
thought
another
bottle
had
enough
gin
in
it
so
they
also
put
in
some
more
but
they
could
get
it
right
though
they
tried
and
tried
old
gillman
thought
it
should
be
filtered
drop
by
drop
seventy
times
through
seven
hundred
sheets
of
but
martin
thought
seven
hundred
times
through
seventy
sheets
was
better
and
martin
thought
it
should
then
be
kept
for
seven
thousand
years
but
old
gillman
thought
seven
years
sufficient
but
neither
of
these
points
had
ever
been
really
proved
and
was
not
that
day
after
this
as
they
could
reach
an
agreement
they
changed
the
subject
to
rum
punch
and
argued
a
good
deal
as
to
the
right
quantities
of
lemon
and
sugar
and
nutmeg
and
whether
it
was
or
was
not
improved
by
the
addition
of
brandy
and
how
much
and
an
orange
or
so
and
how
many
and
a
tangerine
if
you
had
it
and
a
tot
of
gin
if
you
had
it
left
yet
in
this
case
too
the
most
repeated
practice
proved
as
inadequate
as
the
most
confirmed
theory
so
after
a
bit
old
gillman
said
this
is
child
play
boy
after
all
there
but
one
drink
for
kings
and
men
give
us
a
song
over
our
cup
and
i
sing
along
o
ye
right
said
martin
if
you
can
fetch
me
the
only
cup
worthy
to
sing
over
what
cup
that
boy
what
but
a
kingcup
said
martin
a
king
once
drank
from
this
said
gillman
fetching
down
a
goblet
as
golden
as
ale
he
looked
like
a
shepherd
and
had
a
fold
just
across
the
road
but
he
was
a
king
for
all
that
so
strike
up
after
me
then
said
martin
and
they
pushed
the
cup
between
them
and
the
song
too
martin
what
shall
we
drink
of
when
we
sup
gillman
what
d
say

the
king

what

after
this
i
really
do
know
for
i
was
not
there
though
i
should
like
to
have
been
i
only
know
that
when
martin
pippin
stepped
out
of
gillman
farm
with
his
lute
on
his
back
old
gillman
was
fast
asleep
on
the
settle
but
martin
had
never
been
wider
awake
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
there
was
no
sign
of
human
life
anywhere
in
their
stables
the
cows
were
lowing
very
badly
oh
maids
maids
maids
sighed
martin
pippin
rack
and
ruin
my
dears
rack
and
ruin
and
he
fetched
the
milkpails
and
went
into
the
stalls
and
did
the
milkmaids
business
for
them
and
joyce
blossom
and
daisy
and
jessica
clover
stood
as
still
for
him
as
they
stand
in
the
shade
of
the
willows
on
midsummer
day
and
jane
nellie
whisked
her
tail
over
his
mouth
but
seemed
sorry
afterwards
and
joscelyn
lemon
kicked
the
bucket
and
would
not
let
down
her
milk
till
he
sang
to
her
and
then
she
gave
in
but
little
joan
little
jersey
nancy
with
her
soft
dark
eyes
and
soft
dun
sides
and
slender
legs
like
a
deer
licked
his
cheek
and
this
was
martin
you
milkmaids
in
the
hedgerows
get
up
and
milk
your
kine
the
satin
lords
and
ladies
are
all
dressed
up
so
fine
but
if
you
do
not
skim
and
churn
how
can
they
dine
get
up
you
idle
milkmaids
and
call
in
your
kine
you
milkmaids
in
the
hedgerows
you
lazy
lovely
crew
get
up
and
churn
the
buttercups
and
skim
the
milkweed
do
but
the
milkmaids
in
their
country
prints
and
faces
washed
with
dew
they
laughed
at
lords
and
ladies
and
sang
cuckoo
cuckoo
and
if
you
know
their
reason
i
not
so
wise
as
you
when
he
had
done
martin
carried
the
pails
to
the
dairy
and
turned
his
back
on
gillman
for
his
business
there
was
ended
so
he
went
out
at
the
gate
and
lifted
his
face
to
the
downs
it
was
a
lovely
evening
half
the
sky
was
clear
and
blue
and
the
other
half
full
of
silky
gold
clouds
they
wanted
to
be
heavy
and
wet
but
the
sun
was
having
such
fun
on
the
edge
of
the
downs
somewhere
about
duncton
that
they
had
to
be
gold
in
spite
of
themselves
conclusion
one
evening
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
in
september
martin
pippin
walked
along
the
roman
road
to
adversane
and
as
he
approached
he
said
to
himself
there
are
many
sweet
corners
in
sussex
but
few
sweeter
than
this
and
i
thank
my
stars
that
i
have
been
led
to
see
it
once
in
my
life
while
he
was
thanking
his
stars
which
were
already
in
the
sky
waiting
for
the
light
to
go
out
and
give
them
a
chance
he
heard
the
sound
of
weeping
it
came
from
the
malthouse
which
is
the
most
beautiful
building
in
sussex
so
persistent
was
it
that
after
he
had
listened
to
it
for
six
minutes
it
seemed
to
martin
that
he
had
been
listening
to
it
for
six
months
and
for
one
moment
he
believed
himself
to
be
sitting
in
an
orchard
with
his
eyes
shut
and
warm
tears
from
heaven
falling
on
his
face
but
knowing
himself
to
be
too
much
given
to
fancies
he
decided
to
lay
those
ghosts
by
investigation
and
he
went
up
to
the
malthouse
and
looked
inside
there
he
found
a
young
man
flooring
the
barley
as
he
turned
and
it
with
his
spade
he
wept
so
copiously
above
it
that
he
was
frequently
obliged
to
pause
and
wipe
away
his
tears
with
his
arm
for
he
could
no
longer
see
the
barley
he
was
spreading
when
the
maltster
had
interrupted
himself
thus
for
the
third
occasion
martin
pippin
concluded
that
it
was
time
to
address
him
young
master
said
martin
the
bitters
that
are
brewed
from
your
barley
will
need
no
adulterating
behind
the
bar
and
that
flat
the
maltster
leaned
on
his
spade
to
reply
there
are
no
waters
in
all
the
world
said
he
plentiful
enough
to
adulterate
the
bitterness
of
my
despair
then
i
would
preserve
these
rivers
for
better
sport
said
martin
and
if
memory
plays
me
no
tricks
your
name
was
once
robin
rue
and
rue
it
will
be
to
my
last
hour
said
robin
for
a
man
can
no
more
escape
from
his
name
than
from
his
nature
men
observed
martin
have
been
in
this
respect
worse
served
than
women
and
when
will
gillian
gillman
change
her
name
no
sooner
than
i
sighed
robin
rue
a
maid
she
must
die
as
i
a
bachelor
and
if
she
do
not
outlive
me
we
shall
both
be
buried
before
christmas
heaven
forbid
exclaimed
martin
and
stepping
into
the
malthouse
he
offered
robin
six
keys
how
will
these
help
us
said
robin
rue
they
are
the
keys
of
your
lady
said
martin
pippin
and
how
i
have
outpaced
her
i
can
not
imagine
for
she
was
on
the
road
to
you
twenty
hours
ago
this
is
no
news
said
robin
there
she
is
and
he
turned
his
face
to
the
dark
of
the
malthouse
and
there
sitting
on
a
barrel
with
a
slice
of
the
sunset
falling
through
a
slit
on
her
hair
was
gillian
in
love
name
cried
martin
pippin
putting
his
hands
to
his
head
what
more
do
you
want
a
husband
worthy
of
her
moaned
robin
rue
and
how
can
i
suppose
that
i
am
he
oh
that
i
were
only
good
enough
for
her
oh
that
she
could
be
happily
mated
as
after
all
her
sorrows
she
deserves
to
be
then
martin
looked
down
at
the
patch
on
his
shoe
saying
and
tell
me
now
if
you
knew
gillian
happily
wed
would
you
ask
nothing
more
of
life
oh
sir
cried
robin
rue
if
i
knew
any
man
who
could
give
her
all
i
can
not
i
would
contrive
at
least
to
live
long
enough
to
drown
my
sorrows
in
the
beer
brewed
from
this
barley
it
is
a
solace
said
martin
that
must
be
denied
to
no
man
it
seems
that
i
must
help
you
out
to
the
last
and
if
you
will
take
one
glance
out
of
doors
you
will
see
that
the
is
over
robin
rue
looked
out
of
doors
saw
by
the
sun
that
it
was
so
put
down
his
spade
and
went
home
to
supper
gillian
said
martin
pippin
the
squire
did
not
come
himself
to
fetch
her
away
because
he
was
a
young
fool
there
was
no
eighth
floret
on
the
so
the
rime
stayed
at
the
seventh
the
letter
i
threw
with
the
was
a
there
are
apples
all
round
your
silver
ring
because
it
was
once
my
ring
i
do
you
dear
i
do
i
do
and
now
i
have
answered
your
many
questions
answer
me
one
why
did
you
sit
six
months
in
the
weeping
for
love
oh
martin
said
gillian
softly
could
you
tell
my
friends
so
much
they
did
not
know
and
not
know
this
girls
do
not
weep
for
love
they
weep
for
want
of
it
and
she
lifted
her
heavenly
eyes
and
out
of
the
last
of
the
sunlight
looked
at
him
without
thinking
and
martin
like
a
drowning
man
catching
at
straws
caught
her
plaits
one
in
either
hand
and
drawing
himself
to
her
by
them
whispered
do
girls
do
that
but
they
are
so
much
too
good
for
us
gillian
i
know
they
are
whispered
gillian
but
if
all
men
were
like
robin
rue
what
would
become
of
us
must
we
be
punished
for
what
we
help
and
she
put
her
little
finger
on
his
mouth
and
he
kissed
it
then
martin
himself
sat
down
on
the
barrel
where
there
was
only
room
for
one
but
it
was
martin
who
sat
on
it
and
after
a
while
he
said
you
might
think
it
but
i
have
got
a
cottage
and
there
is
nothing
whatever
in
it
but
a
table
which
i
made
myself
and
i
think
that
is
enough
to
begin
with
on
the
way
to
it
we
shall
pass
hardham
where
in
the
priory
ruins
lives
a
hermit
who
is
sometimes
in
the
mood
beyond
hardham
is
the
sunken
bed
of
the
old
canal
that
is
a
secret
not
known
to
everybody
all
flowering
reeds
and
plants
that
love
water
grow
there
and
you
have
to
push
your
way
between
trees
under
which
grass
and
nettles
in
their
season
grow
taller
than
children
but
at
other
times
when
the
bloom
with
gray
and
golden
bees
the
way
is
clear
beyond
this
presently
is
a
little
glade
the
loveliest
in
sussex
in
spring
it
is
patterned
with
primroses
and
windflowers
shake
their
fragile
bells
and
show
their
silver
stars
above
them
some
are
pure
and
colorless
like
maidens
who
know
nothing
of
love
and
others
are
faintly
stained
with
streaks
of
so
exquisite
is
the
beauty
of
these
earthly
flowers
that
it
is
like
a
heavenly
dream
but
it
is
a
dream
come
true
and
you
will
never
pass
it
in
april
without
longing
to
turn
aside
and
kneeling
among
all
that
pallid
gold
and
silver
offer
up
a
prayer
to
the
fairies
and
i
shall
always
kneel
there
with
you
but
beyond
this
is
a
land
of
bracken
and
undiscovered
forests
that
hides
a
special
secret
and
you
may
run
round
it
on
all
sides
within
fifty
yards
yet
never
find
it
unless
you
happen
to
light
upon
a
land
where
grass
springs
under
your
feet
among
deep
and
blackberry
branches
scramble
on
the
ground
from
the
flowery
sides
the
lane
is
called
shelley
lane
for
a
reason
too
beautiful
to
be
told
since
all
the
most
beautiful
reasons
in
the
world
are
kept
secrets
and
this
is
why
dear
gillian
the
world
never
knows
and
can
not
for
the
life
of
it
imagine
what
this
man
sees
in
that
maid
and
that
maid
in
this
man
the
world
can
not
think
why
they
fell
in
love
with
each
other
but
they
have
their
reason
their
beautiful
secret
that
never
gets
told
to
more
than
one
person
and
what
they
see
in
each
other
is
what
they
show
to
each
other
and
it
is
the
truth
only
they
kept
it
hidden
in
their
hearts
until
the
time
came
and
though
you
and
i
may
never
know
why
this
lane
is
called
shelley
to
us
both
it
will
always
be
the
greenest
lane
in
sussex
because
it
leads
to
the
special
secret
i
spoke
of
at
the
end
of
it
is
an
old
gate
clambered
with
blue
periwinkle
and
the
gate
opens
into
a
garden
in
the
midst
of
the
forest
a
garden
so
gay
and
so
scented
so
full
of
butterflies
and
bees
and
and
with
on
them
that
it
might
be
eden
grown
tiny
the
garden
runs
down
a
slope
and
is
divided
from
a
wild
meadow
by
a
brook
crossed
by
a
plank
fringed
with
young
hazel
and
alder
and
at
the
right
time
with
primroses
behind
the
meadow
in
a
glimpse
of
the
distance
full
of
soft
blue
shadows
and
pale
yellow
lights
lie
the
lovely
sides
of
the
downs
rounded
and
dimpled
like
human
beings
dimpled
like
babies
rounded
like
women
the
flow
of
their
lines
is
like
the
breathing
of
a
sleeper
you
can
almost
see
the
tranquil
heaving
of
a
bosom
all
about
and
around
the
garden
are
the
trees
of
the
forest
crouched
in
one
of
the
hollows
is
my
cottage
with
the
table
in
it
and
the
brook
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
is
the
murray
river
gillian
looked
up
from
his
shoulder
i
always
meant
to
find
that
some
day
she
said
with
some
one
to
help
me
i
help
you
said
martin
do
children
play
there
now
children
with
names
as
lovely
as
sylvia
who
are
even
lovelier
than
their
names
they
are
the
only
spirits
who
haunt
it
and
at
the
source
of
it
is
a
mystery
so
beautiful
that
one
day
when
you
and
i
have
discovered
it
together
we
shall
never
come
back
again
but
this
will
be
after
long
years
of
gladness
and
a
life
kept
always
young
not
only
by
our
children
but
by
the
child
which
each
will
continually
rediscover
in
the
other
heart
what
is
this
you
are
telling
me
whispered
gillian
hiding
her
face
again
the
seventh
story
i
glad
it
ends
happily
said
gillian
but
somehow
all
the
time
i
thought
it
would
i
rather
thought
so
too
said
martin
pippin
for
what
does
furniture
matter
as
long
as
sussex
grows
bedstraw
for
ladies
to
sleep
on
and
tuning
his
lute
he
sang
her
his
very
last
song
my
lady
lie
between
linen
my
lady
lie
upon
down
she
shall
not
have
blankets
to
cover
her
feet
or
a
pillow
put
under
her
crown
but
my
lady
shall
lie
on
the
sweetest
of
beds
that
ever
a
lady
saw
for
my
lady
my
beautiful
lady
my
lady
shall
lie
upon
straw
strew
the
sweet
white
straw
he
said
strew
the
straw
for
my
lady
bed
two
ells
wide
from
foot
to
head
strew
my
lady
bedstraw
my
lady
sleep
in
a
castle
my
lady
sleep
in
a
hall
she
shall
not
be
sheltered
away
from
the
stars
by
curtain
or
casement
or
wall
but
my
lady
shall
sleep
in
the
grassiest
mead
that
ever
a
lady
saw
where
my
lady
my
beautiful
lady
my
lady
shall
lie
upon
straw
strew
the
warm
white
straw
said
he
my
arms
shall
all
her
shelter
be
her
and
her
own
strew
my
lady
bedstraw
when
he
had
done
martin
said
will
you
go
traveling
gillian
and
gillian
answered
with
joy
martin
but
before
i
go
traveling
i
will
sing
to
you
and
taking
the
lute
from
him
she
sang
him
her
very
first
song
i
saw
an
old
man
by
the
wayside
sit
down
with
his
crutch
to
rest
like
the
smoke
of
an
angry
kettle
was
the
beard
puffed
over
his
breast
but
when
i
tugged
at
the
old
man
beard
he
turned
to
a
beardless
boy
and
the
boy
and
myself
went
traveling
traveling
wild
with
joy
with
eyes
that
twinkled
and
hearts
that
danced
and
feet
that
skipped
as
they
ran
now
welcome
you
blithe
young
traveler
and
fare
you
well
old
man
when
she
had
done
martin
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
on
the
mouth
and
on
the
eyes
and
on
both
cheeks
and
on
her
two
hands
and
on
the
back
of
the
neck
where
babies
are
kissed
and
standing
her
up
on
the
barrel
and
himself
on
the
ground
he
kissed
her
feet
one
after
the
other
then
he
cried
jump
lass
jump
when
i
tell
you
and
gillian
jumped
and
as
happy
as
children
they
ran
out
of
the
malthouse
and
down
the
road
to
hardham
overhead
the
sun
was
running
away
from
the
clouds
with
all
his
might
and
they
were
trying
to
catch
hold
of
him
one
by
one
in
vain
for
he
rolled
through
their
soft
grasp
leaving
their
hands
bright
with
