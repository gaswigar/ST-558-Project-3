nobody
dog
yes
here
he
comes
again
look
at
him
whose
dog
is
he
we
are
sitting
around
the
little
of
the
savannah
steamer
in
that
languid
state
of
endurance
which
befalls
voyagers
when
though
the
sky
is
clear
and
the
heavens
blue
and
the
sea
calm
as
a
there
is
yet
that
gentle
treacherous
sliding
rise
and
fall
denominated
a
reader
do
you
remember
it
of
all
deceitful
demons
of
the
deep
this
same
smooth
slippery
cheating
is
the
most
diabolic
because
you
see
he
is
a
imp
an
underhanded
unfair
swindling
scamp
who
takes
from
you
all
the
glory
of
endurance
fair
to
the
eye
plausible
as
possible
he
says
to
you
what
the
matter
what
can
you
ask
brighter
than
this
sky
smoother
than
this
sea
more
glossy
and
calm
than
these
rippling
waves
how
fortunate
that
you
have
such
an
exceptionally
smooth
voyage
and
yet
look
around
the
circle
of
pale
faces
fixed
in
that
grim
expression
of
endurance
the
hands
belonging
to
them
resolutely
clasping
lemons
those
looks
of
unutterable
repressed
disgust
and
endurance
are
these
people
seasick
oh
no
of
course
not
of
course
says
the
slippery
plausible
demon
these
people
ca
be
sick
in
this
delightful
weather
and
with
this
delightful
smooth
sea
but
here
comes
the
dog
now
slowly
drooping
from
one
to
another
the
most
and
dejected
of
all
possible
dogs
not
a
dog
either
not
without
signs
about
him
of
good
dog
blood
we
say
one
to
another
as
we
languidly
review
his
points
his
hair
is
fine
and
curly
he
has
what
might
be
a
fine
tail
were
it
not
drooping
in
such
abject
dejection
and
discouragement
evidently
this
is
a
dog
that
has
seen
better
days
a
dog
that
has
belonged
to
somebody
and
taken
kindly
to
petting
his
long
nose
and
great
limpid
eyes
have
a
suggestion
of
blood
about
them
he
comes
and
seats
himself
opposite
and
gazes
at
you
with
a
pitiful
wistful
intense
gaze
as
much
as
to
say
oh
you
know
where
he
is
and
how
came
i
here
poor
miserable
dog
that
i
am
he
walks
in
a
feeble
discouraged
way
to
the
and
sniffs
at
the
salt
water
that
spatters
there
gives
one
lick
and
stops
and
comes
and
sits
quietly
down
again
it
no
go
poor
fellow
he
thirsty
says
one
and
the
professor
albeit
not
the
most
nimble
of
men
climbs
carefully
down
the
for
a
tumbler
of
water
brings
it
up
and
places
it
before
him
eagerly
he
laps
it
all
up
and
then
with
the
confiding
glance
of
a
dog
not
unused
to
kindness
looks
as
if
he
would
like
more
another
of
the
party
fills
his
tumbler
and
he
drinks
that
why
poor
fellow
see
how
thirsty
he
was
i
wonder
whose
dog
he
is
somebody
ought
to
see
to
this
dog
are
comments
passing
round
among
the
ladies
who
begin
throwing
him
bits
of
biscuit
which
he
snaps
up
eagerly
he
hungry
too
only
see
how
hungry
he
is
nobody
feeds
this
dog
whom
does
he
belong
to
one
of
the
ship
stewards
passing
throws
in
a
remark
that
seasick
that
what
the
matter
with
him
it
wo
do
to
feed
that
dog
it
wo
it
make
terrible
work
evidently
some
stray
dog
that
has
come
aboard
the
steamer
by
accident
looking
for
a
lost
master
perhaps
and
now
here
he
is
alone
and
forlorn
nobody
dog
one
of
the
company
a
gentle
young
girl
begins
stroking
his
rough
dusty
hair
which
though
fine
and
capable
of
a
gloss
if
well
kept
now
is
full
of
sticks
and
straws
an
unseemly
patch
of
tar
disfigures
his
coat
on
one
side
which
seems
to
worry
him
for
he
bites
at
it
now
and
then
aimlessly
then
looks
up
with
a
hopeless
appealing
glance
as
much
as
to
say
i
know
i
am
looking
like
a
fright
but
i
ca
help
it
where
is
he
and
where
am
i
and
what
does
it
all
mean
but
the
caresses
of
the
lady
inspire
him
with
a
new
idea
he
will
be
nobody
dog
no
longer
he
will
choose
a
mistress
from
that
moment
he
is
like
a
shadow
to
the
lady
he
follows
her
steps
everywhere
mournful
patient
with
drooping
tail
and
bowed
head
as
a
dog
not
sure
of
his
position
but
humbly
determined
to
have
a
mistress
if
dogged
faith
and
persistency
can
compass
it
she
walks
the
deck
and
tick
tick
pitapat
go
the
four
little
paws
after
her
she
stops
he
stops
and
looks
wistful
whenever
and
wherever
she
sits
down
he
goes
and
sits
at
her
feet
and
looks
up
at
her
with
eyes
of
unutterable
entreaty
the
stewards
passing
through
the
give
him
now
and
then
a
professional
kick
and
he
sneaks
out
of
one
door
only
to
walk
quietly
round
a
corner
and
in
at
the
other
and
place
himself
at
her
feet
her
party
laugh
and
rally
her
on
her
attractions
she
now
and
then
pats
and
caresses
and
pities
him
and
gives
him
morsels
of
biscuit
out
of
her
stores
evidently
she
belongs
to
the
band
of
in
the
tedious
dulness
of
the
voyage
the
dog
becomes
a
topic
and
his
devotion
to
the
lady
an
engrossment
we
call
for
his
name
the
stewards
call
him
jack
but
he
seems
to
run
about
as
well
for
one
name
as
another
and
it
is
proposed
to
call
him
barnes
from
the
name
of
the
boat
we
are
on
the
suggestion
drops
from
want
of
energy
in
our
very
demoralized
company
to
carry
it
not
that
we
are
seasick
one
of
us
oh
no
grimly
upright
always
at
table
and
eating
our
three
meals
a
day
who
dares
intimate
that
we
are
sick
perish
the
thought
it
is
only
a
dizzy
headachy
dulness
with
an
utter
disgust
for
every
thing
in
general
that
creeps
over
us
and
mournful
face
reflects
but
too
truly
our
own
internal
troubles
but
at
last
here
we
are
at
savannah
and
the
scriven
house
and
the
obliging
waiters
rush
out
and
take
us
in
and
do
for
us
with
the
most
exhaustive
attention
here
let
us
remark
on
the
differences
in
hotels
in
some
you
are
waited
on
sourly
in
some
grudgingly
in
some
carelessly
in
some
with
insolent
negligence
at
the
scriven
house
you
are
received
like
friends
every
thing
is
at
your
hand
and
the
head
waiter
arranges
all
as
benignantly
as
if
he
were
really
delighted
to
make
you
comfortable
so
we
had
a
golden
time
at
the
scriven
house
where
there
is
every
thing
to
make
the
wayfarer
enjoy
himself
poor
jack
was
overlooked
in
the
bustle
of
the
steamer
and
the
last
agonies
of
getting
landed
we
supposed
we
had
lost
sight
of
him
forever
but
lo
when
the
lady
was
crossing
the
hall
to
her
room
a
dog
desperate
and
dusty
fought
his
way
through
the
ranks
of
waiters
to
get
to
her
it
is
our
dog
put
him
out
gently
do
hurt
him
said
the
young
lady
father
but
jack
was
desperate
and
fought
for
his
mistress
and
bit
the
waiter
that
ejected
him
and
of
course
got
kicked
with
emphasis
into
the
street
the
next
morning
one
of
our
party
looking
out
of
the
window
saw
jack
watching
slyly
outside
of
the
hotel
evidently
he
was
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
cast
himself
at
the
feet
of
his
chosen
protectress
if
i
can
only
see
her
all
will
yet
be
right
he
says
to
himself
we
left
savannah
in
the
cars
that
afternoon
and
the
last
we
heard
of
jack
he
had
been
seen
following
the
carriage
of
his
elected
mistress
in
a
drive
to
bonaventure
what
was
the
end
of
the
poor
dog
romance
we
have
never
heard
whether
he
is
now
blessed
in
being
somebody
dog
petted
cared
for
caressed
or
whether
he
roves
the
world
as
dog
with
no
rights
to
life
liberty
or
pursuit
of
happiness
we
have
no
means
of
knowing
but
the
measureless
depth
of
dumb
sorrow
want
woe
entreaty
that
there
are
in
a
wandering
dog
eyes
is
something
that
always
speaks
much
to
us
dogs
in
particular
which
seem
to
leave
their
own
kind
to
join
themselves
to
man
and
only
feel
their
own
being
complete
when
they
have
formed
a
human
friendship
it
seems
like
the
ancient
legends
of
those
incomplete
natures
a
little
below
humanity
that
needed
a
human
intimacy
to
develop
them
how
much
dogs
suffer
mentally
is
a
thing
they
have
no
words
to
say
but
there
is
no
sorrow
deeper
than
that
in
the
eyes
of
a
homeless
friendless
masterless
dog
we
rejoice
therefore
to
learn
that
one
portion
of
the
twenty
thousand
dollars
which
the
ladies
of
boston
have
raised
for
our
dumb
animals
is
about
to
be
used
in
keeping
a
for
stray
dogs
let
no
one
sneer
at
this
if
among
the
five
sparrows
sold
for
two
farthings
not
one
is
forgotten
by
our
father
certainly
it
becomes
us
not
to
forget
the
poor
dumb
companions
of
our
mortal
journey
capable
with
us
of
love
and
its
sorrows
of
faithfulness
and
devotion
there
is
we
are
told
a
dog
who
haunts
the
station
at
revere
daily
looking
for
the
return
of
a
master
he
last
saw
there
and
who
alas
will
never
return
there
are
many
times
and
oft
dogs
strayed
from
families
accustomed
to
kindness
and
petting
who
have
lost
all
they
love
and
have
none
to
care
for
them
to
give
such
a
refuge
till
they
find
old
masters
or
new
seems
only
a
part
of
christian
civilization
the
more
christ
spirit
prevails
the
more
we
feel
for
all
that
can
feel
and
suffer
the
poor
brute
struggles
and
suffers
with
us
companion
of
our
mysterious
travel
in
this
lower
world
and
who
has
told
us
that
he
may
not
make
a
step
upward
in
the
beyond
for
our
own
part
we
like
that
part
of
the
poor
indian
faith
that
thinks
admitted
to
yon
equal
sky
his
faithful
dog
shall
bear
him
company
so
much
for
poor
jack
now
for
savannah
it
is
the
prettiest
of
southern
cities
laid
out
in
squares
planted
with
fine
trees
and
with
a
series
of
little
parks
intersecting
each
street
so
that
one
can
walk
on
fine
walks
under
trees
quite
through
the
city
down
to
a
larger
park
at
the
end
of
all
here
there
is
a
fountain
whose
charming
sculpture
reminds
one
of
those
in
the
south
of
france
a
belt
of
violets
encircles
it
and
a
garden
of
flowers
shut
in
by
an
evergreen
hedge
surrounds
the
whole
it
is
like
a
little
bit
of
paris
and
strikes
one
refreshingly
who
has
left
new
york
two
days
before
in
a
whirling
the
thing
that
every
stranger
in
savannah
goes
to
see
as
a
matter
of
course
is
bonaventure
this
is
an
ancient
and
picturesque
estate
some
miles
from
the
city
which
has
for
years
been
used
as
a
cemetery
how
shall
we
give
a
person
who
has
never
seen
or
gray
moss
an
idea
of
it
solemn
avenues
of
these
gigantic
trees
with
their
narrow
evergreen
leaves
their
gnarled
contorted
branches
feathered
with
ferns
and
parasitic
plants
and
draped
with
long
swaying
draperies
of
this
gray
moss
impress
one
singularly
the
effect
is
solemn
and
unearthly
and
the
distant
tombs
urns
and
obelisks
gleaming
here
and
there
among
the
shadows
make
it
more
impressive
beneath
the
trees
large
clumps
of
palmetto
with
their
waving
green
fans
give
a
tropical
suggestion
to
the
scene
while
yellow
jessamine
wreathe
and
clamber
from
tree
to
tree
or
weave
mats
of
yellow
blossoms
along
the
ground
it
seems
a
labyrinth
of
fairy
grottoes
and
is
in
its
whole
impression
something
so
unique
that
no
one
should
on
any
account
miss
of
seeing
it
savannah
is
so
pleasant
a
city
and
the
hotels
there
are
so
well
kept
that
many
find
it
far
enough
south
for
all
their
purposes
and
spend
the
winter
there
but
we
are
bound
farther
towards
the
equator
and
so
here
we
ponder
the
question
of
our
onward
journey
a
railroad
with
pullman
takes
one
in
one
night
from
savannah
to
jacksonville
then
there
is
a
steamboat
that
takes
one
round
by
the
open
sea
and
up
through
the
mouth
of
the
john
river
to
jacksonville
any
one
who
has
come
to
see
scenery
should
choose
this
route
the
entrance
of
the
john
from
the
ocean
is
one
of
the
most
singular
and
impressive
passages
of
scenery
that
we
ever
passed
through
in
fine
weather
the
sight
is
magnificent
besides
this
a
smaller
boat
takes
passengers
to
jacksonville
by
what
is
called
the
inside
passage
a
circuitous
course
through
the
network
of
islands
that
lines
the
shore
this
course
also
offers
a
great
deal
of
curious
interest
to
one
new
to
southern
scenery
and
has
attractions
for
those
who
dread
the
sea
by
any
of
these
courses

are

thirty

about

a
sort

that
is

the
is
in
our
view
the
best
worthy
to
represent
the
tree
of
life
of
any
that
grows
on
our
earth
it
is
the
fairest
the
noblest
the
most
generous
it
is
the
most
upspringing
and
abundant
of
all
trees
which
the
lord
god
caused
to
grow
eastward
in

its
wood
is

and
hard

tough
fit
to
sustain
the
immense
weight
of
its
fruitage
real
good
ripe
oranges
are
very
heavy
and
the
generosity
of
the
tree
inclines
it
to
fruit

clusters
we
counted

a
cluster
of
eighteen
hanging
low
and
weighing
down
the
limb
but
this
large
and
many
larger
than
this
which
are
parts
of
one
orchard
are
comparatively
recent
growths
in
every
one
of
them
was
killed
even
with
the
ground
then
they
started
up
with
the
genuine
pluck
of
a
which
never
says
die
and
began
to
grow
again
nobody
pruned
them
or
helped
them
or
cared
much
about
them
any
way
and
you
can
see
trees
that
have
grown
up
in
four
five
and
six
trunks
just
as
the
suckers
sprung
up
from
the
roots
then
when
they
had
made
some
progress
came
the
and
nearly
killed
them
down
again
the
owners
of
the
land
discouraged
broke
down
the
fences
and
moved
off
and
for
a
while
the
land
was
left
an
open
common
where
wild
cattle
browsed
and
rubbed
themselves
on
the
trees
but
still
in
spite
of
all
they
have
held
on
their
way
rejoicing
till
now
they
are
the
beautiful
creatures
they
are
truly
we
may
call
them
trees
of
the
lord
full
of
sap
and
greenness
full
of
lessons
of
perseverance
to
us
who
get
frosted
down
and
cut
off
time
and
time
again
in
our
lives
let
us
hope
in
the
lord
and
be
up
and
at
it
again
it
is
certainly
quite
necessary
to
have
some
such
example
before
our
eyes
in
struggling
to
found
a
colony
here
we
had
such
a
hard
time
getting
our
church
and
schoolhouse
for
in
these
primitive
regions
one
building
must
do
for
both
there
were
infinite
negotiations
and
cases
to
go
through
before
a
site
could
be
bought
with
a
clear
title
and
the
freedman
bureau
would
put
us
up
a
building
where
school
could
be
taught
on
and
worship
held
on
sundays
but
at
last
it
was
done
and
a
neat
pleasant
little
place
it
was
we
had
a
little
mason
and
hamlin
missionary
organ
which
we
used
to
carry
over
on
sundays
and
a
cloth
which
converted
the
master
desk
of
into
the
minister
pulpit
and
as
we
had
minister
organist
and
choir
all
in
our
own
family
we
were
sure
of
them
at
all
events
and
finally
a
good
congregation
was
being
gathered
on
a
school
for
whites
and
blacks
was
taught
until
the
mismanagement
of
the
had
used
up
the
sum
devoted
to
common
schools
and
left
us
without
a
teacher
for
a
year
but
this
fall
our
friend
who
had
accepted
the
situation
of
county
overseer
of
schools
had
just
completed
arrangements
to
open
again
both
the
white
and
the
black
schools
when
lo
in
one
night
our
poor
little
schoolhouse
was
burned
to
the
ground
with
our
mason
and
hamlin
organ
in
it
latterly
it
had
been
found
inconvenient
to
carry
it
backward
and
forward
and
so
it
had
been
left
locked
in
a
closet
and
met
a
fiery
doom
we
do
not
suppose
any
malicious
incendiarism
there
appears
evidence
that
some
strolling
loafers
had
gotten
in
to
spend
the
night
and
probably
been
careless
of
their
fire
the
southern
pine
is
inflammable
as
so
much
pitch
and
will
almost
light
with
the
scratch
of
a
match
well
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
imitate
the
pluck
of
the
which
we
immediately
did
our
neighborhood
had
increased
by
three
or
four
families
and
a
meeting
was
immediately
held
and
each
one
pledged
himself
to
raise
a
certain
sum
we
feel
the
want
of
it
more
for
the
schoolhouse
than
even
for
the
church
we
go
on
with
our
sunday
services
at
each
other
houses
but
alas
for
the
poor
children
black
and
white
growing
up
so
fast
who
have
been
kept
out
of
school
now
a
year
and
who
are
losing
these
best
months
for
study
to
see
people
who
are
willing
and
anxious
to
be
taught
growing
up
in
ignorance
is
the
sorest
sight
that
can
afflict
one
and
we
count
the
days
until
we
shall
have
our
church
and
schoolhouse
again
but
meanwhile
mandarin
presents
to
our
eyes
a
marvellously
improved
aspect
two
or
three
large
handsome
houses
are
built
up
in
our
immediate
neighborhood
your
old
collaborator
of
the
christian
union
has
a
most
fascinating
place
a
short
distance
from
us
commanding
a
noble
sweep
of
view
up
and
down
the
river
on
our
right
hand
two
gentlemen
from
newark
have
taken
each
a
lot
and
the
gables
of
the
house
of
one
of
them
overlook
the
bravely
from
the
river
this
southern
pine
unpainted
makes
a
rich
soft
color
for
a
house
being
merely
oiled
it
turns
a
soft
golden
brown
which
harmonizes
charmingly
with
the
landscape
how
cold
is
it
here
we
ask
ourselves
a
dozen
times
a
day
what
season
is
it
we
say
this
spring
this
summer
and
speak
of
our
northern
life
as
last
winter
there
are
cold
nights
and
occasionally
white
frosts
but
the
degree
of
cold
may
be
judged
from
the
fact
that
the
calla
ethiopica
goes
on
budding
and
blossoming
out
of
doors
that
la
marque
roses
have
not
lost
their
leaves
and
have
long
young
shoots
on
them
and
that
our
handmaiden
a
pretty
young
mulattress
occasionally
brings
to
us
a
whole
dish
of
roses
and
buds
which
her
devoted
has
brought
her
from
some
back
cottage
in
the
we
have
also
eaten
the
last
tomatoes
from
the
old
vines
since
we
came
but
a
pretty
severe
frost
has
nipped
them
as
well
as
cut
off
a
promising
lot
of
young
peas
just
coming
into
pod
but
the
will
still
grow
along
and
we
shall
have
others
soon
we
eat
radishes
out
of
the
ground
and
lettuce
now
and
then
a
little
nipped
by
the
frost
and
we
get
long
sprays
of
yellow
jessamine
just
beginning
to
blossom
in
the
woods
yes
it
is
spring
though
still
it
is
cold
enough
to
make
our
good
bright
fire
a
to
the
family
it
is
good
to
keep
fire
in
a
country
where
it
is
considered
a
great
point
to
get
rid
of
wood
one
piles
and
heaps
up
with
a
genial
cheer
when
one
thinks
the
more
you
burn
the
better
it
only
costs
what
you
pay
for
cutting
and
hauling
we
begin
to
find
our
usual
number
of
letters
wanting
to
know
all
this
that
and
the
other
about
florida
all
in
good
time
friends
come
down
here
once
and
use
your
own
eyes
and
you
will
know
more
than
we
can
teach
you
till
when
adieu
illustration
the
wrong
side
of
the
tapestry
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
full
half
of
the
tourists
and
travellers
that
come
to
florida
return
intensely
disappointed
and
even
disgusted
why
evidently
because
florida
like
a
piece
of
embroidery
has
two
sides
to
it
one
side
all
and
thrums
without
order
or
position
and
the
other
side
showing
flowers
and
arabesques
and
brilliant
coloring
both
these
sides
exist
both
are
undeniable
undisputed
facts
not
only
in
the
case
of
florida
but
of
every
place
and
thing
under
the
sun
there
is
a
right
side
and
a
wrong
side
to
every
thing
now
tourists
and
travellers
generally
come
with
their
heads
full
of
certain
romantic
ideas
of
waving
palms
flowers
and
fruit
all
bursting
forth
in
tropical
abundance
and
in
consequence
they
go
through
florida
with
disappointment
at
every
step
if
the
banks
of
the
john
were
covered
with
if
they
blossomed
every
month
in
the
year
if
they
were
always
loaded
with
fruit
if
and
bananas
grew
wild
if
the
flowers
hung
in
festoons
from
tree
to
tree
if
the
ground
were
enamelled
with
them
all
winter
long
so
that
you
saw
nothing
else
then
they
would
begin
to
be
satisfied
but
in
point
of
fact
they
find
in
approaching
florida
a
dead
sandy
level
with
patches
behind
them
of
rough
coarse
grass
and
tall
whose
tops
are
so
far
in
the
air
that
they
seem
to
cast
no
shade
and
a
little
scrubby
underbrush
the
few
houses
to
be
seen
along
the
railroad
are
the
forlornest
of
huts
the
cattle
that
stray
about
are
thin
and
and
look
as
if
they
were
in
the
last
tottering
stages
of
starvation
then
again
winter
in
a
region
has
a
peculiar
desolate
untidiness
from
the
fact
that
there
is
none
of
that
clearing
of
the
trees
and
shrubs
which
the
sharp
frosts
of
the
northern
regions
occasion
here
the
leaves
many
of
them
though
they
have
lost
their
beauty
spent
their
strength
and
run
their
course
do
not
fall
thoroughly
and
cleanly
but
hang
on
in
ragged
patches
waiting
to
be
pushed
off
by
the
swelling
buds
of
next
year
in
new
england
nature
is
an
smart
decisive
that
has
her
times
and
seasons
and
brings
up
her
ends
of
life
with
a
positive
jerk
she
will
have
no
when
her
time
comes
she
clears
off
the
gardens
and
forests
thoroughly
and
once
for
all
and
they
are
clean
then
she
freezes
the
ground
solid
as
iron
and
then
she
covers
all
up
with
a
nice
pure
of
snow
and
seals
matters
up
as
a
good
housewife
does
her
jelly
tumblers
under
covers
there
you
are
fast
and
cleanly
if
you
have
not
got
ready
for
it
so
much
the
worse
for
you
if
your
tender
roots
are
not
taken
up
your
cellar
banked
your
doors
listed
she
ca
help
it
it
your
own
lookout
not
hers
but
nature
down
here
is
an
easy
demoralized
indulgent
old
grandmother
who
has
no
particular
time
for
any
thing
and
does
every
thing
when
she
happens
to
feel
like
it
is
it
winter
or
is
it
is
the
question
that
is
likely
often
to
occur
in
the
settling
month
of
december
when
everybody
up
north
has
put
away
summer
clothes
and
put
all
their
establishments
under
consequently
on
arriving
in
time
the
first
thing
that
strikes
the
eye
is
the
ragged
untidy
look
of
the
foliage
and
shrubbery
about
of
the
trees
are
deciduous
and
stand
entirely
bare
of
leaves
the
rest
are
evergreen
which
by
this
time
having
come
through
the
fierce
heats
of
summer
have
acquired
a
seared
and
dusky
hue
different
from
the
vivid
brightness
of
early
spring
in
the
garden
you
see
all
the
proceedings
which
mark
the
indefinite
boundaries
of
the
season
the
have
lost
about
half
their
green
leaves
some
varieties
however
in
this
climate
seem
to
be
partly
evergreen
the
la
marque
and
the
crimson
rose
sometimes
called
louis
philippe
seem
to
keep
their
last
year
foliage
till
spring
pushes
it
off
with
new
leaves
once
in
a
while
however
nature
like
a
grandmother
in
a
fret
comes
down
on
you
with
a
most
unexpected
snub
you
have
a
cold
spell
an
actual
frost
during
the
five
years
in
which
we
have
made
this
our
winter
residence
there
have
twice
been
frosts
severe
enough
to
spoil
the
though
not
materially
injuring
the
trees
this
present
winter
has
been
generally
a
colder
one
than
usual
but
there
have
been
no
hurtful
frosts
but
one
great
cause
of
disgust
and
provocation
of
tourists
in
florida
is
the
occurrence
of
these
cold
snaps
it
is
really
amusing
to
see
how
people
accustomed
to
the
tight
freezes
the
drifting
snow
wreaths
the
stinging
rain
hail
and
snow
of
the
northern
winter
will
when
the
thermometer
goes
down
to
or
and
a
white
frost
is
seen
out
of
doors
they
are
perfectly
outraged
weather
if
this
is
your
florida
winter
deliver
me
all
the
while
they
could
walk
out
any
day
into
the
woods
as
we
have
done
and
gather
eight
or
ten
varieties
of
flowers
blooming
in
the
open
air
and
eat
radishes
and
lettuce
and
peas
grown
in
the
garden
well
it
is
to
be
confessed
that
the
cold
of
warm
climates
always
has
a
peculiarly
aggravating
effect
on
the
mind
a
warm
region
is
just
like
some
people
who
get
such
a
character
for
good
temper
that
they
never
can
indulge
themselves
even
in
an
earnest
disclaimer
without
everybody
crying
out
upon
them
what
puts
you
in
such
a
passion
so
nature
if
she
generally
sets
up
for
amiability
during
the
winter
months
can
not
be
allowed
a
little
tiff
now
and
then
a
white
frost
a
cold
without
being
considered
a
monster
it
is
to
be
confessed
that
the
chill
of
warm
climates
when
they
are
chilly
is
peculiar
and
travellers
should
prepare
for
it
not
only
in
mind
but
in
wardrobe
by
carrying
a
plenty
of
warm
clothing
and
above
all
an
inestimable
bottle
which
they
can
fill
with
hot
water
to
dissipate
the
chill
at
night
an
experience
of
four
winters
leads
us
to
keep
on
about
the
usual
winter
clothing
until
march
or
april
the
first
day
after
our
arrival
to
be
sure
we
put
away
all
our
furs
as
things
of
the
past
but
we
keep
abundance
of
warm
shawls
and
above
all
wear
the
usual
flannels
till
late
in
the
spring
invalids
seeking
a
home
here
should
be
particularly
careful
to
secure
rooms
in
which
there
can
be
a
fire
it
is
quite
as
necessary
as
at
the
north
and
with
this
comfort
the
cold
spells
few
in
number
as
they
are
can
be
easily
passed
by
our
great
feature
in
the
northern
landscape
which
one
never
fails
to
miss
and
regret
here
is
the
grass
the
of
the
land
is
an
expression
that
often
comes
over
one
the
peculiar
sandy
soil
is
very
difficult
to
arrange
in
any
tidy
fashion
you
can
not
make
beds
or
alleys
of
it
it
all
runs
together
like
a
place
where
hens
have
been
scratching
and
consequently
it
is
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
to
have
ornamental
grounds
at
the
north
the
process
of
making
a
new
place
appear
neat
and
inviting
is
very
rapid
one
season
of
and
the
thing
is
done
here
however
it
is
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
to
get
turf
of
any
sort
to
growing
the
bermuda
grass
and
a
certain
coarse
turf
are
the
only
kind
that
can
stand
the
summer
heat
and
these
never
have
the
beauty
of
northern
grass
now
we
have
spent
anxious
hours
and
much
labor
over
a
little
plot
in
our
which
we
seeded
with
white
clover
and
which
for
a
time
was
green
and
lovely
to
behold
but
alas
the
scripture
was
too
strikingly
verified
when
the
sun
shineth
on
it
with
a
burning
heat
it
withereth
the
grass
and
the
grace
of
the
fashion
of
it
perisheth
the
fact
is
that
people
can
not
come
to
heartily
like
florida
till
they
certain
deficiencies
as
the
necessary
shadow
to
certain
excellences
if
you
want
to
live
in
an
you
must
give
up
wanting
to
live
surrounded
by
green
grass
when
we
get
to
the
new
heaven
and
the
new
earth
then
we
shall
have
it
all
right
there
we
shall
have
a
climate
at
once
cool
and
bracing
yet
hot
enough
to
mature
oranges
and
our
trees
of
life
shall
bear
twelve
manner
of
fruit
and
yield
a
new
one
every
month
out
of
juicy
meadows
green
as
emerald
enamelled
with
every
kind
of
flower
shall
grow
our
golden
blossoming
and
fruiting
together
as
now
they
do
there
shall
be
no
mosquitoes
or
gnats
or
or
snakes
and
best
of
all
there
shall
be
no
fretful
people
everybody
shall
be
like
a
instrument
all
sounding
in
accord
and
never
a
semitone
out
of
the
way
meanwhile
we
caution
everybody
coming
to
florida
do
hope
for
too
much
because
you
hear
that
roses
and
callas
blossom
in
the
open
air
all
winter
and
flowers
abound
in
the
woods
do
expect
to
find
an
eternal
summer
prepare
yourself
to
see
a
great
deal
that
looks
rough
and
desolate
and
coarse
prepare
yourself
for
some
chilly
days
and
nights
and
whatever
else
you
neglect
to
bring
with
you
bring
the
resolution
strong
and
solid
always
to
make
the
best
of
things
for
ourselves
we
are
getting
reconciled
to
a
sort
of
wild
picnicky
kind
of
life
this
general
which
florida
inculcates
if
we
painted
her
we
should
not
represent
her
as
a
neat
trim
damsel
with
starched
linen
cuffs
and
collar
she
would
be
a
brunette
dark
but
comely
with
gorgeous
tissues
a
general
disarray
and
dazzle
and
with
a
sort
of
jolly
untidiness
free
easy
and
joyous
the
great
charm
after
all
of
this
life
is
its
outdoorness
to
be
able
to
spend
your
winter
out
of
doors
even
though
some
days
be
cold
to
be
able
to
sit
with
windows
open
to
hear
birds
daily
to
eat
fruit
from
trees
and
pick
flowers
from
hedges
all
winter
long
is
about
the
whole
of
the
story
this
you
can
do
and
this
is
why
florida
is
life
and
health
to
the
invalid
we
get
every
year
quantities
of
letters
from
persons
of
small
fortunes
asking
our
advice
whether
they
had
better
move
to
florida
for
our
part
we
never
advise
people
to
anywhere
as
a
general
rule
it
is
the
person
who
feels
the
inconveniences
of
a
present
position
so
as
to
want
to
move
who
will
feel
the
inconvenience
of
a
future
one
florida
has
a
lovely
winter
but
it
has
also
three
formidable
summer
months
july
august
and
september
when
the
heat
is
excessive
and
the
liabilities
of
new
settlers
to
sickness
so
great
that
we
should
never
wish
to
take
the
responsibility
of
bringing
anybody
here
it
is
true
that
a
very
comfortable
number
of
people
do
live
through
them
but
still
it
is
not
a
joke
by
any
means
to
move
to
a
new
country
the
first
colony
in
new
england
lost
just
half
its
members
in
the
first
six
months
the
rich
around
cincinnati
proved
graves
to
many
a
family
before
they
were
brought
under
cultivation
but
florida
is
peculiarly
adapted
to
the
needs
of
people
who
can
afford
two
houses
and
want
a
refuge
from
the
drain
that
winter
makes
on
the
health
as
people
now
have
at
nahant
or
rye
so
they
might
at
a
small
expense
have
in
florida
and
come
here
and
be
at
home
that
is
the
great
charm
to
be
at
home
a
house
here
can
be
simple
and
inexpensive
and
yet
very
charming
already
around
us
a
pretty
group
of
is
rising
and
we
look
forward
to
the
time
when
there
shall
be
many
more
when
all
along
the
shore
of
the
john
cottages
and
villas
shall
look
out
from
the
green
trees
illustration
a
letter
to
the
girls
mandarin
yes
the
girls
let
me
see
who
are
they
i
mean
nellie
and
mary
and
emily
and
charlotte
and
gracie
and
susie
and
carry
and
kitty
and
you
of
every
pretty
name
my
charming
little
pussy
willow
friends
dear
souls
all
i
bless
your
bright
eyes
and
fancy
you
about
me
as
a
sort
of
inspiration
to
my
writing
i
could
wish
you
were
every
one
here
do
you
wish
that
the
arabian
nights
were
true
and
that
there
were
really
little
square
bits
of
enchanted
carpet
on
which
one
has
only
to
sit
down
and
pronounce
two
cabalistic
words
and
away
one
goes
through
the
air
sailing
off
on
visits
then
girls
would
we
have
a
nice
wide
bit
of
carpet
and
would
we
have
the
whole
bright
flock
of
you
come
fluttering
down
together
to
play
croquet
with
us
under
the
this
afternoon
and
while
you
were
waiting
for
your
turns
to
come
you
should
reach
up
and
pull
down
a
bough
and
help
yourselves
to
oranges
or
you
should
join
a
party
now
going
out
into
the
to
gather
yellow
jessamine
is
and
as
the
yellow
jessamine
is
in
all
its
glory
the
girls
here
are
sending
little
boxes
of
it
north
to
their
various
friends
through
the
mail
they
have
just
been
bringing
in
long
wreaths
and
clusters
of
it
for
me
to
look
at
and
are
consulting
how
to
pack
it
then
this
afternoon
when
we
have
done
croquet
it
is
proposed
that
we
form
a
party
to
visit
aunt
katy
who
lives
about
two
miles
away
in
the
over
on
julington
as
the
people
here
say
on
julington
means
on
a
branch
of
the
named
julington
creek
although
it
is
as
wide
as
the
connecticut
river
at
hartford
we
put
the
oldest
mule
to
an
old
wagon
and
walk
and
ride
alternately
some
of
us
riding
one
way
and
some
the
other
the
old
mule
named
fly
is
a
ancient
patriarch
who
having
worked
all
his
days
without
seeing
any
particular
use
in
it
is
now
getting
rather
misanthropic
in
his
old
age
and
obstinately
determined
not
to
put
one
foot
before
the
other
one
bit
faster
than
he
is
actually
forced
to
do
only
the
most
vigorous
urging
can
get
him
to
step
out
of
a
walk
although
we
are
told
that
the
rogue
has
a
very
fair
trot
at
his
command
if
any
of
the
darky
tribe
are
behind
him
he
never
thinks
of
doing
any
thing
but
pricking
up
his
ears
and
trotting
at
a
decent
pace
but
when
only
girls
and
women
are
to
the
fore
down
flop
his
ears
down
goes
his
head
and
he
creeps
obstinately
along
in
the
aforementioned
contemplative
manner
looking
for
all
the
world
like
a
very
rough
dilapidated
old
in
a
state
of
locomotion
well
i
do
blame
him
poor
brute
life
i
suppose
is
as
much
a
mystery
to
him
as
to
the
philosophers
and
he
has
never
been
able
to
settle
what
it
is
all
about
this
fuss
of
being
harnessed
periodically
to
impertinent
carts
and
driven
here
and
there
for
no
valuable
purpose
that
he
can
see
such
as
he
is
fly
is
the
absolute
property
of
the
girls
and
women
being
past
and
though
he
never
willingly
does
any
thing
but
walk
yet
his
walk
is
considerably
faster
than
that
of
even
the
most
agile
of
us
and
he
is
by
many
degrees
better
than
nothing
he
is
admitted
on
all
hands
to
be
a
beast
and
will
certainly
never
run
away
with
any
of
us
as
to
the
choice
of
excursions
there
are
several
one
to
our
neighbor
bowens
to
see
where
we
can
watch
the
whole
process
from
the
grinding
of
the
cane
through
the
various
vats
and
boilers
till
at
last
we
see
the
perfected
sugar
in
fine
bright
crystals
in
the
we
are
hospitably
treated
to
saucers
of
lovely
sirup
just
on
the
point
of
crystallization
liquid
which
of
course
we
do
not
turn
away
from
then
again
we
can
go
down
the
banks
of
the
river
to
where
our
neighbor
duncan
has
cleared
up
a
little
spot
in
what
used
to
be
virgin
forest
and
where
now
a
cosey
little
cottage
is
beginning
to
peep
through
its
many
windows
upon
the
here
a
bright
little
baby
a
real
little
florida
flower
has
lately
opened
a
pair
of
lovely
eyes
and
is
growing
daily
in
grace
and
favor
in
front
of
this
cottage
spared
from
the
forest
are
three
great
stately
magnolias
such
trees
as
you
never
saw
their
leaves
resemble
those
of
the
tree
large
and
of
a
glossy
varnished
green
they
are
evergreen
and
in
may
are
covered
with
great
white
blossoms
something
like
and
with
very
much
the
same
odor
the
trees
at
the
north
called
magnolias
give
no
idea
whatever
of
what
these
are
they
are
giants
among
flowers
seem
worthy
to
be
trees
of
heaven
then
there
are
all
sorts
of
things
to
be
got
out
of
the
woods
there
are
to
be
pressed
and
dried
and
made
into
fans
there
is
the
long
which
can
be
sewed
into
mats
baskets
and
various
little
fancy
articles
by
busy
fingers
every
day
brings
something
to
explore
the
woods
for
not
a
day
in
winter
passes
that
you
can
not
bring
home
a
reasonable
little
nosegay
of
flowers
many
of
the
flowers
here
do
not
have
their
seasons
but
seem
to
bloom
the
year
round
so
that
all
the
time
you
are
sure
of
finding
something
the
woods
now
are
full
of
bright
delicate
ferns
that
no
frosts
have
touched
and
that
spring
and
grow
perennially
the
book
of
nature
here
is
never
shut
and
clasped
with
ice
and
snow
as
at
the
north
and
of
course
we
spend
about
half
our
time
in
the
open
air
the
last
sensation
of
our
circle
is
our
we
do
not
approve
of
putting
free
birds
in
cages
but
aunt
katy
brought
to
one
of
our
party
such
a
beautiful
fellow
so
brilliant
a
red
with
such
a
smart
black
crest
on
his
head
and
such
a
long
flashing
red
tail
that
we
resist
the
desire
to
keep
him
a
little
while
just
to
look
at
him
aunt
katy
insisted
that
he
would
take
it
to
heart
that
he
would
be
tame
in
a
few
days
and
eat
out
of
our
hands
in
short
she
insisted
that
he
would
consider
himself
a
fortunate
bird
to
belong
to
us
aunt
katy
you
must
know
is
a
nice
old
lady
we
use
that
term
with
a
meaning
for
though
black
as
the
tents
of
kedar
she
is
a
perfect
lady
in
her
manners
she
was
born
and
brought
up
and
has
always
lived
in
this
neighborhood
and
knows
every
bird
in
the
forest
as
familiarly
as
if
they
were
all
her
own
chickens
and
she
has
great
skill
in
getting
them
to
come
to
her
to
be
caught
well
our
was
named
phoebus
of
a
kind
that
audubon
calls
a
and
a
fine
large
roomy
cage
was
got
down
for
him
which
was
of
old
tenanted
by
a
very
merry
and
rackety
and
then
the
question
arose
what
shall
we
do
with
him
for
you
see
girls
having
a
soft
place
in
our
heart
for
all
pets
instead
of
drowning
some
of
our
kittens
in
the
fall
as
reasonable
people
should
we
were
seduced
by
their
gambols
and
their
prettiness
to
let
them
all
grow
up
together
and
the
result
is
that
we
have
now
in
our
domestic
retinue
four
adult
cats
of
most
formidable
proportions
these
be
the
generations
of
our
cats
first
liz
the
mother
second
peter
her
oldest
son
third
anna
and
lucinda
her
daughters
peter
is
a
particularly
martial
combative
obnoxious
beast
very
fluffy
and
fussy
with
great
yellow
eyes
and
a
most
resounding
sonorous
voice
there
is
an
immense
deal
of
cat
in
peter
he
is
concentrated
cathood
a
nugget
of
pure
cat
and
in
fact
we
are
all
a
little
in
awe
of
him
he
rules
his
mother
and
sisters
as
if
he
had
never
heard
of
susan
anthony
and
stanton
liz
anna
and
lucinda
are
also
cats
with
capital
stomachs
now
comes
the
problem
the
moment
the
was
let
into
his
cage
there
was
an
instant
whisk
of
tails
and
a
glare
of
great
yellow
eyes
and
a
sharpening
of
that
marked
a
situation
the
scripture
tells
us
a
time
is
coming
when
the
lion
shall
lie
down
with
the
lamb
but
that
time
has
come
in
florida
peter
is
a
regular
heathen
and
has
the
remotest
idea
of
the
millennium
he
has
much
of
the
lion
in
him
but
he
never
could
lie
down
peaceably
with
the
lamb
unless
indeed
the
lamb
were
inside
of
him
when
he
would
sleep
upon
him
without
a
twinge
of
conscience
unmistakably
we
could
see
in
his
eyes
that
he
considered
phoebus
as
caught
for
his
breakfast
and
he
sat
licking
his
chops
inquiringly
as
who
should
ask
when
will
the
cloth
be
laid
and
things
be
ready
now
the
party
to
whom
the
was
given
is
also
the
the
guide
philosopher
and
friend
of
the
cats
it
is
she
who
examines
the
plates
after
each
meal
and
treasures
fragments
which
she
cuts
up
and
prepares
for
their
repast
with
commendable
regularity
it
is
she
who
presides
and
keeps
order
at
and
forasmuch
as
peter
on
account
of
his
masculine
strength
and
rapacity
is
apt
to
get
the
better
of
his
mother
and
sisters
she
picks
him
up
and
bears
him
growling
from
the
board
when
he
has
demolished
his
own
portion
and
is
proceeding
to
eat
up
theirs
imagine
now
the
cares
of
a
woman
with
four
cats
and
a
bird
on
her
mind
phoebus
had
to
be
carefully
pinned
up
in
a
blanket
the
first
night
then
the
cage
was
swung
by
strong
cords
from
the
roof
of
the
veranda
the
next
morning
peter
was
found
perched
on
top
of
it
glaring
fiendishly
the
cage
was
moved
along
and
peter
scaled
a
pillar
and
stationed
himself
at
the
side
to
be
sure
he
could
get
the
bird
as
the
slats
were
too
close
for
his
paw
to
go
through
but
poor
phoebus
seemed
wild
with
terror
was
it
for
this
he
left
his
native
wilds
to
be
exposed
in
a
prison
to
glaring
hyenas
and
tigers
the
cats
were
admonished
chastised
scat
through
all
the
moods
and
tenses
though
their
patroness
still
serves
out
their
commons
regularly
determined
that
they
shall
not
have
the
apology
of
empty
stomachs
phoebus
is
evidently
a
philosopher
a
bird
of
strong
sense
having
found
after
two
or
three
days
trial
that
the
cats
ca
get
him
having
clusters
of
the
most
delicious
rice
dangling
from
the
roof
of
his
cage
and
fine
crisp
lettuce
verdantly
inviting
through
the
bars
he
seems
to
have
accepted
the
situation
and
when
nobody
is
in
the
veranda
he
uplifts
his
voice
in
song
what
cheer
what
cheer
he
says
together
with
many
little
twitters
and
gurgles
for
which
we
have
no
musical
notes
aunt
katy
promises
to
bring
him
a
little
wife
before
long
and
if
that
be
given
him
what
shall
hinder
him
from
being
happy
as
april
comes
in
they
shall
build
their
nest
in
the
cage
and
give
us
a
flock
of
little
well
girls
we
are
making
a
long
letter
and
this
must
do
for
this
week
illustration
a
and
a
ride
in
it
monday
dear
girls
would
you
like
to
get
into
that
little
white
yacht
that
lies
dancing
and
courtesying
on
the
blue
waters
of
the
john
this
pleasant
monday
morning
it
is
a
day
of
days
spring
has
come
down
with
all
her
smiles
and
roses
in
one
hour
the
great
blue
sheet
of
water
shimmers
and
glitters
like
so
much
liquid
and
now
the
word
comes
in
from
our
neighbor
the
owner
of
the
would
you
like
to
go
sailing
of
course
we
should
that
is
exactly
what
we
want
and
forthwith
there
is
a
running
and
a
mustering
of
the
clans
and
a
flapping
of
broad
and
parties
from
all
the
three
houses
file
down
and
present
themselves
as
candidates
for
pleasure
a
great
basket
of
oranges
is
hoisted
in
and
the
white
sails
spread
and
with
youth
at
the
prow
and
pleasure
at
the
helm
away
we
go
the
breezes
blowing
manfully
at
our
sails
the
river
is
about
five
miles
from
shore
to
shore
and
we
have
known
it
of
old
for
a
most
enticing
and
tricksy
customer
it
gently
wooes
and
seduces
you
it
starts
you
out
with
all
manner
of
zephyrs
until
you
get
into
the
very
middle
two
miles
from
land
on
either
side
when
down
goes
your
limp
sail
and
the
breeze
is
off
on
some
other
errand
and
you
are
left
to
your
reflections
not
immediately
did
this
happen
to
us
however
though
when
we
came
to
the
middle
of
the
river
our
course
was
slow
enough
to
give
plenty
of
opportunity
to
discuss
the
basket
of
oranges
we
settle
it
among
us
that
we
will
cross
to
lake
this
name
is
given
to
a
wide
bayou
which
the
river
makes
running
up
into
the
forest
for
a
track
of
about
nine
miles
it
is
a
famous
fishing
and
hunting
region
and
a
favorite
and
chosen
abode
of
the
alligators
at
the
farther
end
of
it
are
said
to
be
swamps
where
they
have
their
lairs
and
lay
their
eggs
and
hatch
out
charming
young
alligators
just
at
the
opening
where
the
river
puts
into
this
lake
are
the
nets
of
the
who
supply
the
jacksonville
market
with
that
delicious
article
we
are
minded
to
go
over
and
fill
our
before
they
go
now
we
near
the
opposite
shore
of
the
river
we
see
the
great
tuft
of
spanish
oaks
which
marks
the
house
of
the
old
macintosh
plantation
once
the
palmiest
in
florida
this
demesne
had
nine
thousand
acres
of
land
including
in
it
the
doctor
lake
and
the
islands
therein
with
all
the
store
of
swamps
and
forests
and
alligators
nests
groves
and
it
was
a
sort
of
pride
of
territory
that
animated
these
old
aboriginal
planters
for
of
the
whole
nine
thousand
acres
which
formed
the
estate
only
about
five
hundred
ever
were
cleared
and
subject
to
cultivation
one
of
these
days
we
are
projecting
to
spend
a
day
picnicking
on
this
old
plantation
now
deserted
and
decaying
and
then
we
can
tell
you
many
curious
things
in
its
history
but
now
we
are
coming
close
alongside
the
we
find
no
fishermen
to
traffic
with
discerning
a
rude
hut
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
bayou
we
make
for
that
expecting
there
to
find
them
we
hail
a
boy
who
lies
idly
in
a
boat
by
the
shore
halloo
my
fine
fellow
can
you
tell
us
where
the
people
are
that
tend
that
net
do
know
is
the
reply
that
comes
over
the
water
can
you
sell
us
any
fish
got
a
couple
o
trout
bring
along
and
away
we
go
rippling
before
the
breeze
while
the
boy
with
the
graceful
deliberation
which
marks
the
movements
of
the
native
population
prepares
to
come
after
us
i
do
believe
he
understood
said
one
oh
yes
he
only
taking
his
time
as
they
all
do
down
here
he
be
along
in
the
course
of
the
forenoon
at
last
he
comes
alongside
and
shows
a
couple
of
great
fish
which
look
more
like
incipient
cod
or
haddock
than
trout
such
as
they
are
however
we
conclude
a
bargain
for
them
and
away
goes
our
boy
with
fifty
cents
in
his
pocket
what
he
can
want
of
fifty
cents
in
a
hut
on
the
other
side
of
doctor
lake
is
a
question
can
he
trade
with
alligators
but
he
has
a
boat
and
we
foresee
that
that
boat
will
make
a
voyage
across
to
the
grocery
on
the
opposite
point
where
whiskey
pork
and
flour
are
sold
meanwhile
we
looked
at
the
little
rude
hut
again
it
was
monday
morning
and
a
string
of
clothes
was
fluttering
on
a
line
and
a
good
many
little
garments
among
them
there
is
a
mother
then
and
a
family
of
children
growing
up
we
noticed
the
sheen
of
three
or
four
probably
wild
ones
about
the
house
now
we
go
rippling
up
the
bayou
close
along
by
the
shore
the
land
is
swampy
and
the
forests
glister
with
the
shining
varnished
leaves
of
the
magnolias
and
we
saw
far
within
the
waving
green
fans
of
the
the
and
were
just
bursting
into
leaf
with
that
dazzling
green
of
early
spring
which
is
almost
metallic
in
brilliancy
the
maples
were
throwing
out
keys
larger
and
than
the
maples
of
the
north
there
is
a
whir
of
wings
and
along
the
opposite
shore
of
the
bayou
the
file
in
long
platoons
now
and
then
a
with
his
long
neck
and
legs
varies
the
scene
there
swoops
down
a
and
we
see
him
bearing
aloft
a
silvery
fish
wriggling
and
twisting
in
his
grasp
we
were
struck
with
the
similarity
of
our
tastes
he
was
fond
of
shad
so
were
we
he
had
a
wriggling
fish
in
his
claws
and
we
had
a
couple
flapping
and
bouncing
in
the
basket
over
which
we
were
gloating
there
was
but
one
point
of
difference
he
undoubtedly
would
eat
his
fish
raw
whereas
we
were
planning
to
have
ours
cut
in
slices
and
fried
with
salt
pork
otherwise
the
and
we
were
out
on
the
same
errand
with
the
same
results
yet
at
first
view
i
must
confess
when
we
saw
him
rise
with
a
wriggling
fish
in
his
claws
he
struck
us
as
a
monster
it
seemed
a
savage
proceeding
and
we
pitied
the
struggling
fish
while
ours
were
yet
flapping
in
the
basket
this
is
far
from
pleasant
to
contemplate
every
thing
seems
to
be
in
for
it
it
is
catch
who
catch
can
through
all
the
animal
kingdom
till
it
comes
up
to
man
and
he
eats
the
whole
choosing
or
refusing
as
suits
his
taste
one
wonders
why
there
was
not
a
superior
order
of
beings
made
to
eat
us
mosquitoes
and
get
now
and
then
a
nip
to
be
sure
but
there
is
nobody
provided
to
make
a
square
meal
of
us
as
we
do
on
a
wild
turkey
for
example
but
speaking
of
eating
and
discussing
fried
fish
and
salt
pork
aroused
harrowing
reflections
in
our
company
we
found
ourselves
at
one
in
the
middle
of
doctor
lake
with
the
at
least
five
miles
away
and
it
was
agreed
that
it
was
time
to
put
about
the
had
suggested
and
now
came
the
beauty
of
the
proceeding
we
drove
merrily
out
of
doctors
lake
into
the
beautiful
blue
middle
of
the
john
and
there
the
zephyrs
gayly
whispered
friends
and
when
you
get
ashore
let
us
know
the
river
was
like
a
molten
the
sun
staring
steadfastly
down
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
get
out
the
oars
and
pull
strong
and
steady
and
so
we
do
it
is
the
old
trick
of
this
john
whereby
muscular
development
is
promoted
first
two
gentlemen
row
then
a
lady
takes
one
oar
and
we
work
our
way
along
to
the
shore
but
it
is
full
four
before
we
get
there
as
we
approach
we
pass
brisk
little
daisy
who
is
out
alone
in
her
boat
with
her
and
doll
she
has
been
rowing
down
to
make
a
morning
call
on
bessie
and
is
now
returning
off
on
the
end
of
the
wharf
we
see
the
whole
family
watching
for
our
return
the
professor
white
beard
and
red
fez
cap
make
a
striking
point
in
the
tableau
our
little
friend
bob
and
even
baby
and
mamma
are
on
the
point
of
observation
it
is
past
four
dinner
long
over
and
they
have
all
been
wondering
what
has
got
us
we
walk
straight
up
to
the
house
with
but
one
idea
dinner
we
cease
to
blame
the
being
in
a
condition
fully
to
enter
into
his
feelings
a
little
more
and
we
could
eat
fish
as
he
does
without
roasting
doubtless
he
and
and
the
little
may
have
been
discussing
us
over
their
savory
meal
but
we
find
little
to
say
till
dinner
is
despatched
the
last
hour
on
board
the
boat
had
been
devoted
to
a
course
of
reflections
on
our
folly
in
starting
out
without
luncheon
and
to
planning
a
more
advised
excursion
up
julington
creek
with
all
the
proper
paraphernalia
a
for
making
coffee
an
embankment
of
diversified
with
cakes
crackers
and
cheese
this
it
is
understood
is
to
come
off
morning
feb
such
was
to
have
been
my
programme
but
alas
this
morning
though
the
day
rose
bright
and
clear
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
the
river
has
looked
all
day
like
a
sheet
of
glass
there
is
a
drowsy
hazy
calm
over
every
thing
all
our
windows
and
doors
are
open
and
every
sound
seems
to
be
ringingly
distinct
the
chatter
and
laughing
of
the
children
god
bless
who
are
all
day
long
frolicking
on
the
end
of
the
wharf
or
rowing
about
in
the
boats
the
leisurely
chip
chip
of
the
men
who
are
busy
in
mending
the
steamboat
wharf
the
hammer
of
the
carpenters
on
the
yet
unfinished
part
of
our
neighbor
house
the
scream
of
the
jays
in
the
all
blend
in
a
sort
of
dreamy
indistinctness
is
one
of
the
two
days
of
our
week
the
day
of
the
arrival
of
the
mail
you
who
have
a
driblet
two
or
three
times
a
day
from
the
mail
can
not
conceive
the
interest
that
gathers
around
these
two
weekly
arrivals
the
whole
forenoon
is
taken
up
with
it
we
sit
on
the
veranda
and
watch
the
far
down
the
river
a
mere
white
speck
as
she
passes
through
the
wooded
opening
above
jacksonville
she
grows
larger
and
larger
as
she
comes
sailing
up
like
a
great
white
stately
swan
first
on
the
farther
side
of
the
river
till
she
comes
to
landing
and
then
turning
her
white
breast
full
toward
mandarin
wharf
she
comes
ploughing
across
freighted
with
all
our
hopes
and
fears
then
follows
the
rush
for
our
mail
then
the
distribution
after
which
all
depart
to
their
several
apartments
with
their
letters
then
follow
readings
to
each
other
general
tidings
and
greetings
and
when
the
letters
are
all
read
twice
over
and
thoroughly
discussed
come
the
papers
tuesday
is
the
christian
union
day
as
well
as
the
day
for
about
a
dozen
other
papers
and
the
professor
is
seen
henceforward
with
bursting
pockets
like
a
very
large
carnation
bursting
its
calyx
he
is
a
walking
mass
of
papers
the
afternoon
has
been
devoted
to
reflection
gossiping
and
various
expeditions
and
have
gone
boating
with
and
come
home
on
the
edge
of
the
evening
with
the
animating
news
that
they
have
seen
the
two
first
alligators
of
the
season
that
shows
that
warm
weather
is
to
be
expected
for
your
alligator
is
a
delicate
beast
and
never
comes
out
when
there
is
the
least
danger
of
catching
cold
another
party
have
been
driving
fly
through
the
woods
to
julington
creek
and
come
back
reporting
that
they
have
seen
an
owl
the
professor
gives
report
of
having
seen
two
veritable
and
a
blue
crane
news
which
touches
us
all
tenderly
for
we
have
as
yet
had
not
a
turkey
to
our
festive
board
we
ourselves
have
been
having
a
quiet
game
of
croquet
out
under
the
playing
till
we
could
see
the
wickets
no
longer
so
goes
our
day
breezy
and
full
of
variety
your
world
union
is
seen
in
perspective
far
off
and
hazy
like
the
opposite
shores
of
the
river
nevertheless
this
is
the
place
to
papers
and
books
for
every
thing
that
sweeps
into
this
quiet
bay
is
long
and
quietly
considered
we
shall
have
something
anon
to
say
as
to
how
you
all
look
in
the
blue
perspective
of
distance
meanwhile
we
must
tell
the
girls
that
phoebus
has
wholly
accommodated
himself
to
his
situation
and
wakes
us
mornings
with
his
singing
what
cheer
what
cheer
he
says
whether
he
alludes
to
the
four
cats
or
to
his
large
cage
or
to
his
own
internal
determination
like
mark
tapley
to
be
jolly
is
evident
last
week
aunt
katy
brought
a
mate
for
him
which
was
christened
luna
she
was
a
pretty
creature
smaller
less
brilliant
but
gracefully
shaped
and
with
a
nice
crest
on
her
head
we
regret
to
say
that
she
lived
only
a
few
hours
being
found
dead
in
the
cage
in
the
morning
a
day
or
two
since
great
sympathy
was
expressed
for
phoebus
in
view
of
the
matrimonial
happiness
of
a
pair
of
who
came
to
survey
our
yellow
jessamine
with
a
view
to
setting
up
housekeeping
there
would
not
the
view
of
freedom
and
wedded
joys
depress
his
spirits
not
a
bit
of
it
he
is
evidently
cut
out
for
a
jolly
bachelor
and
as
long
as
he
has
fine
chambers
and
a
plenty
of
rough
rice
what
cares
he
for
family
life
the
heartless
fellow
piped
up
what
cheer
what
cheer
the
very
day
that
he
got
his
cage
to
himself
is
this
peculiar
a
lady
at
our
table
has
stated
it
as
a
universal
fact
that
as
soon
as
a
man
wife
dies
he
immediately
gets
a
new
suit
of
clothes
well
why
should
he
nothing
conduces
more
to
cheerfulness
on
the
whole
we
think
phoebus
is
a
pattern
bird
ask
the
author
of
my
summer
in
a
garden
if
he
ca
condense
his
account
of
calvin
virtues
into
a
tract
to
be
distributed
among
our
cats
peter
is
such
a
hardened
sinner
a
little
calvinism
might
operate
well
on
him
illustration
picnicking
up
julington
mandarin
this
day
of
february
is
a
day
made
on
purpose
for
a
a
day
that
comes
only
once
in
four
years
certainly
ought
to
be
good
for
something
and
this
is
as
good
a
day
for
picnicking
up
julington
as
if
it
had
been
bespoken
four
years
ahead
a
bright
sun
a
blue
sky
a
fresh
strong
breeze
upon
the
water
these
are
contributions
art
contributes
two
trim
little
white
yachts
the
nelly
and
the
bessie
and
three
down
we
all
troop
to
the
landing
with
our
and
baskets
of
oranges
and
out
flutter
the
sails
and
away
we
go
no
danger
of
being
left
in
the
lurch
in
the
middle
of
the
river
there
is
all
the
breeze
one
wants
and
a
little
more
than
the
timorous
love
and
we
go
rippling
and
racing
through
the
water
in
merry
style
the
spray
flies
so
that
we
need
our
and
blankets
but
the
more
the
merrier
we
sweep
gallantly
first
by
the
cottage
of
your
whilom
editor
in
the
union
and
get
a
friendly
salute
and
then
flutter
by
d
cottage
and
wave
our
handkerchiefs
and
get
salutes
in
return
now
we
round
the
point
and
julington
opens
her
wide
blue
arms
to
receive
us
we
pass
by
neighbor
h
and
again
wave
our
handkerchiefs
and
get
answering
salutes
we
run
up
to
the
wharf
to
secure
another
boat
and
oarsman
in
the
person
of
neighbor
p
and
away
we
fly
up
julington
a
creek
it
is
called
but
fully
as
wide
as
the
connecticut
at
hartford
and
wooded
to
the
water
on
either
side
by
these
glorious
florida
forests
it
is
a
late
backward
spring
for
florida
and
so
these
forests
are
behindhand
with
their
foliage
yet
so
largely
do
they
consist
of
bright
polished
evergreen
trees
that
the
eye
scarcely
feels
the
need
of
the
deciduous
foliage
on
which
the
bright
misty
green
of
spring
lies
like
an
uncertain
vapor
there
is
a
large
admixture
in
the
picture
of
the
cool
tints
of
the
gray
moss
which
drapes
every
tree
and
hangs
in
long
pendent
streamers
waving
in
the
wind
the
shores
of
the
creek
now
begin
to
be
lined
on
either
side
with
tracts
of
a
which
the
natives
call
bonnets
the
blossom
is
like
that
of
our
yellow
but
the
leaves
are
very
broad
and
beautiful
as
they
float
like
green
islands
on
the
blue
waters
here
and
there
even
in
the
centre
of
the
creek
are
patches
of
them
intermingled
with
quantities
of
the
a
floating
plant
which
abounds
in
these
tracts
along
the
edges
of
these
patches
are
the
favorite
haunts
of
the
fish
who
delight
to
find
shelter
among
the
green
leaves
so
the
yachts
come
to
anchor
and
the
party
divides
into
the
three
and
prepares
to
proceed
to
business
we
have
some
bustle
in
distributing
our
stove
and
and
to
the
different
boats
as
we
are
to
row
far
up
stream
and
when
we
have
caught
our
dinner
land
and
cook
it
i
sit
in
the
bow
and
being
good
for
nothing
in
the
make
myself
of
service
by
holding
the
french
in
my
lap
the
being
at
my
feet
on
one
side
the
stove
on
the
other
and
the
in
full
view
in
front
i
consider
myself
as
in
a
sense
at
housekeeping
meanwhile
the
are
produced
the
lines
thrown
and
the
professional
fishermen
and
fisherwomen
become
all
absorbed
in
their
business
we
row
slowly
along
the
bobbing
undulating
field
of
broad
green
and
i
deliver
myself
to
speculations
on
nature
the
roots
of
these
of
the
size
of
a
man
arm
often
lie
floating
for
yards
on
the
surface
and
with
their
scaly
joints
look
like
black
serpents
the
ribbed
and
shining
leaves
as
they
float
out
upon
the
water
are
very
graceful
one
is
struck
with
a
general
similarity
in
the
plant
and
animal
growths
in
these
regions
the
element
of
grotesqueness
seems
largely
to
enter
into
it
roots
of
plants
become
scaly
contorted
and
lie
in
convolutions
like
the
coils
of
a
serpent
such
are
the
whose
roots
lie
in
scaly
folds
along
the
ground
catching
into
the
earth
by
strong
rootlets
and
then
rising
up
here
and
there
into
tall
waving
green
fans
whose
graceful
beauty
in
the
depths
of
these
forests
one
is
never
tired
of
admiring
amid
this
and
convoluted
jungle
of
scaly
roots
how
natural
to
find
the
scaly
alligator
looking
like
an
animated
form
of
the
grotesque
vegetable
world
around
sluggish
unwieldy
he
seems
a
animal
coming
up
from
a
plant
perhaps
a
link
from
plant
to
animal
in
memory
perhaps
of
a
previous
woodland
life
he
fills
his
stomach
with
and
bits
of
board
wherever
he
can
find
one
to
chew
it
is
his
way
of
taking
tobacco
i
have
been
with
a
hunter
who
dissected
one
of
these
creatures
and
seen
him
take
from
his
stomach
a
mass
of
mingled
with
bits
of
brick
worn
smooth
as
if
the
digestive
fluids
had
somewhat
corroded
them
the
fore
leg
and
paw
of
the
alligator
has
a
pitiful
and
rather
shocking
resemblance
to
a
black
human
hand
and
the
muscular
power
is
so
great
that
in
case
of
the
particular
alligator
i
speak
of
even
after
his
head
was
taken
off
when
the
incision
was
made
into
the
pectoral
muscle
for
the
purpose
of
skinning
this
black
hand
and
arm
rose
up
and
gave
the
operator
quite
a
formidable
push
in
the
chest
we
hope
to
see
some
of
these
creatures
out
but
none
appear
the
infrequency
of
their
appearance
marks
the
lateness
and
backwardness
of
our
spring
there
a
cry
of
victory
is
heard
from
the
forward
boat
and
mademoiselle
nelly
is
seen
energetically
working
her
elbows
a
scuffle
ensues
and
the
captive
has
a
free
berth
on
a
boat
without
charge
for
we
shout
like
people
who
are
getting
hungry
as
in
truth
we
are
and
now
elsie
starts
in
our
boat
and
all
is
commotion
till
a
fine
blue
bream
spotted
with
black
is
landed
next
a
large
black
trout
with
his
wide
yellow
mouth
comes
up
unwillingly
from
the
crystal
flood
we
pity
them
but
what
are
we
to
do
it
is
a
question
between
dinner
and
dinner
these
fish
out
marketing
on
their
own
account
darted
at
our
hook
expecting
to
catch
another
fish
we
catch
them
and
instead
of
eating
they
are
eaten
after
all
the
instinct
of
hunting
and
catching
something
is
as
strong
in
the
human
breast
as
in
that
of
cat
or
tiger
and
we
all
share
the
exultation
which
sends
a
shout
from
boat
to
boat
as
a
new
acquisition
is
added
to
our
prospective
and
now
right
in
front
of
us
looms
up
from
the
depth
of
a
group
of
pines
and
magnolias
a
white
skeleton
of
a
tree
with
gnarled
arms
bleached
by
years
of
wind
and
sun
swathed
with
long
waving
folds
of
gray
moss
on
the
very
of
this
proudly
above
all
possibility
of
capture
a
nest
is
built
full
eighty
feet
in
the
air
and
about
the
size
of
a
built
like
an
old
marauding
baron
stronghold
in
the
middle
ages
in
inaccessible
fastnesses
lined
within
and
swathed
without
with
gray
moss
it
is
a
splendid
post
of
observation
we
can
see
the
white
head
and
shoulders
of
the
bird
perched
upon
her
nest
and
already
they
perceive
us
the
pair
rise
and
clap
their
wings
and
discourse
to
each
other
with
loud
shrill
cries
perhaps
of
indignation
that
we
who
have
houses
to
dwell
in
and
beef
and
chickens
to
eat
should
come
up
and
invade
their
the
i
beg
his
pardon
the
for
i
can
see
that
he
is
a
bird
of
no
mean
size
and
proportions
has
as
good
a
right
to
think
that
the
river
and
the
fish
were
made
for
him
as
we
and
better
too
because
the
creator
has
endowed
him
with
wonderful
eyesight
which
enables
him
from
the
top
of
a
tree
eighty
feet
high
to
search
the
depths
of
the
river
mark
his
prey
and
dive
down
with
unerring
certainty
to
it
he
has
his
charter
in
his
eyes
his
beak
his
claws
and
doubtless
he
has
a
right
to
remonstrate
when
we
who
have
neither
eyes
beaks
nor
claws
adapted
to
the
purpose
manage
to
smuggle
away
his
dinner
thankful
are
we
that
no
mighty
hunter
is
aboard
and
that
the
atrocity
of
shooting
a
bird
on
her
nest
will
not
be
perpetrated
here
we
are
a
harmless
company
and
mean
so
well
by
them
that
they
really
might
allow
us
one
dinner
out
of
their
larder
we
have
rowed
as
far
up
julington
as
is
expedient
considering
that
we
have
to
row
down
again
and
so
we
land
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
our
fortress
greatly
to
his
discontent
wild
piercing
cries
come
to
us
now
and
then
from
the
heights
of
the
eyry
but
we
unmoved
proceed
with
our
do
you
want
to
know
the
best
way
in
the
world
of
cooking
fish
then
listen
the
fish
are
taken
to
the
river
by
one
and
simply
washed
of
their
superfluous
internals
though
by
no
means
scaled
a
moment
prepares
them
for
the
fire
meanwhile
a
broad
hole
has
been
dug
in
the
smooth
white
sand
and
a
fire
of
dry
light
wood
is
merrily
crackling
therein
the
is
set
the
filled
and
put
on
to
boil
when
we
disperse
to
examine
the
one
or
two
parties
take
to
the
boats
and
skim
a
little
distance
up
stream
where
was
a
grove
of
youthful
the
is
essentially
a
different
variety
from
the
tree
in
moist
rich
land
the
shrub
rears
a
high
head
and
looks
as
if
it
were
trying
to
become
a
tree
but
it
never
does
it
the
leaf
also
is
essentially
different
the
is
three
or
four
yards
long
curiously
plaited
and
folded
in
the
centre
of
both
palmetto
and
palm
is
the
bud
from
whence
all
future
leaves
spring
rising
like
a
green
spike
this
bud
is
in
great
request
for
and
all
manner
of
and
it
was
for
these
buds
that
our
was
going
a
venturesome
boy
by
climbing
a
neighboring
tree
and
jumping
into
the
palm
can
succeed
in
securing
this
prize
though
at
some
risk
of
life
and
limb
our
party
returned
with
two
about
two
yards
long
and
one
or
two
of
the
long
graceful
leaves
but
now
the
fire
has
burned
low
and
the
is
thoroughly
heated
bring
me
says
the
presiding
cook
any
quantity
of
those
great
broad
and
forth
impetuous
rush
the
youth
and
cool
and
dripping
are
forthcoming
wherewith
we
the
hole
in
the
sand
then
heads
and
points
compactly
folded
go
in
a
line
of
fish
and
are
covered
down
green
and
comfortable
with
a
double
blanket
of
dripping
then
with
a
flat
board
for
our
shovel
we
rake
back
first
the
hot
sand
and
then
the
coals
and
brands
yet
remaining
of
the
fire
watches
are
looked
at
and
it
is
agreed
by
old
hands
experienced
in
that
half
an
hour
shall
be
given
to
complete
our
dinner
meanwhile
the
steaming
calls
for
coffee
and
the
french
receives
its
fragrant
store
while
the
from
his
high
tower
of
observation
interjects
plaintive
notes
of
remonstrance
i
fancy
him
some
hoarse
old
moralist
gifted
with
uncomfortable
forever
shrieking
down
protests
on
the
ways
of
the
thoughtless
children
of
men
what
are
we
doing
to
those
good
fish
of
his
which
he
could
prepare
for
the
table
in
much
shorter
order
an
old
hunter
who
has
sometimes
explored
the
ground
under
the
nest
says
that
bushels
of
may
be
found
there
neatly
picked
testifying
to
the
excellent
appetite
which
prevails
in
those
and
to
the
efficiency
of
the
plan
of
eating
fish
we
wander
abroad
and
find
great
blue
and
white
violets
and
along
the
river
brink
and
we
take
advantage
of
the
not
very
dense
shade
of
a
pine
to
set
out
the
contents
of
our
eggs
cakes
in
tempting
variety
jellies
and
fruits
make
their
appearance
in
a
miscellaneous
sort
of
way
and
now
comes
the
great
operation
of
getting
out
our
fish
without
shovel
other
than
a
bit
of
inflammable
the
thing
presents
evident
difficulties
but
it
must
be
done
and
done
it
is
a
platter
is
improvised
of
two
large
the
fire
is
raked
off
and
the
fish
emerge
from
their
somewhat
the
worse
as
to
external
appearance
but
we
bear
them
off
to
the
feast
in
the
trial
process
we
find
that
the
whole
external
part
of
the
fish
scales
skin
and
fins
comes
off
leaving
the
meat
white
and
pure
and
deliciously
juicy
a
bit
well
salted
and
peppered
is
forthwith
transferred
to
each
plate
and
all
agree
that
never
fish
was
better
and
sweeter
then
coffee
is
served
round
and
we
feast
and
are
merry
when
the
meal
is
over
we
arrange
our
table
for
the
benefit
of
the
the
fragments
of
fish
yet
remaining
bits
of
bread
and
cake
and
cheese
are
all
systematically
arranged
for
him
to
take
his
luncheon
after
we
are
gone
bergh
himself
could
not
ask
more
exemplary
conduct
for
now
the
westering
sun
warns
us
that
it
is
time
to
be
spreading
our
sails
homeward
and
well
pleased
all
we
disperse
ourselves
into
our
respective
boats
to
fish
again
as
we
pass
the
on
the
shore
the
sport
engages
every
one
on
board
except
myself
who
sitting
in
the
end
of
the
boat
have
leisure
to
observe
the
wonderful
beauty
of
the
sky
the
shadows
of
the
in
the
water
and
the
glorious
trees
one
magnolia
i
saw
that
deserved
to
be
called
an
archangel
among
the
sons
of
the
forest
full
a
hundred
feet
high
it
stood
with
a
trunk
rising
straight
round
and
branchless
for
full
fifty
feet
and
crowned
with
a
glorious
head
of
rich
dark
shining
leaves
when
its
awake
what
a
glory
will
it
become
all
alone
out
there
in
the
silent
forest
with
only
god
to
see
no
let
us
believe
with
milton
that
millions
of
spiritual
creatures
walk
the
earth
unseen
both
when
we
wake
and
when
we
sleep
and
the
great
may
spring
and
flower
for
them
the
fishing
luck
still
continues
and
the
prospects
for
a
breakfast
morning
are
bright
one
great
fellow
however
makes
off
with
hook
spoon
and
all
and
we
see
him
floundering
among
the
with
it
in
his
mouth
vastly
dissatisfied
with
his
acquisition
like
many
a
poor
fellow
in
the
world
fishing
he
has
snapped
at
a
fine
bait
and
got
a
sharp
hook
for
his
pains
now
we
come
back
to
the
yachts
and
the
fishing
is
over
the
sun
is
just
going
down
as
we
raise
our
white
sails
and
away
for
the
broad
shining
expanse
of
the
john
in
a
moment
the
singers
of
our
party
break
forth
into
song
and
glee
and
catches
roll
over
the
water
from
one
yacht
to
the
other
as
we
race
along
neck
and
neck
the
evening
wind
rises
fresh
and
fair
and
we
sweep
down
the
beautiful
coast
great
bars
of
opal
and
lie
across
the
western
sky
the
blue
waves
turn
rosy
and
ripple
and
sparkle
with
the
evening
light
as
we
fly
along
on
the
distant
wharf
we
see
all
the
watching
for
us
as
we
come
to
land
after
the
most
successful
picnic
that
heart
could
conceive
each
fisherwoman
has
her
fish
to
exhibit
and
her
exploits
to
recount
and
there
is
a
plentiful
in
each
of
the
houses
so
goes
the
of
february
on
the

illustration
magnolia
mandarin
march
magnolia
is
a
name
suggestive
of
beauty
and
for
once
the
name
does
not
belie
the
fact
the
there
is
about
the
pleasantest
winter
resort
in
florida
we
have
been
passing
a
day
and
night
there
as
guest
of
some
friends
and
find
a
company
of
about
seventy
people
enjoying
themselves
after
the
usual
fashions
of
summer
the
house
is
situated
on
a
little
eminence
and
commands
a
fine
sweep
of
view
both
up
and
down
the
river
in
the
usual
fashion
of
southern
life
it
is
surrounded
with
wide
verandas
where
the
guests
pass
most
of
their
time
the
ladies
chatting
and
working
embroidery
the
gentlemen
reading
newspapers
and
smoking
the
amusements
are
boating
and
fishing
parties
of
longer
or
shorter
duration
rides
and
walks
along
the
shore
or
croquet
on
a
fine
shady
in
a
grove
back
of
the
house
we
tried
them
all
first
we
went
in
a
about
a
couple
of
miles
up
a
little
creek
the
shore
on
either
side
was
ruffled
with
the
green
with
here
and
there
a
golden
blossom
the
which
were
large
and
lofty
were
almost
entirely
of
the
deciduous
kind
which
was
just
bursting
into
leaf
and
the
effect
was
very
curious
and
peculiar
one
has
often
remarked
what
a
misty
effect
the
first
buddings
of
foliage
have
here
there
was
a
mist
of
many
colors
pink
crimson
yellow
and
vivid
green
the
hues
of
the
young
leaves
or
of
the
different
tags
and
keys
of
the
different
species
of
trees
here
and
there
a
wild
plum
sheeted
in
brilliant
white
varied
the
tableau
we
rowed
up
to
shore
drew
down
a
branch
and
filled
the
laps
of
the
ladies
with
sprays
of
white
flowers
the
sun
beat
down
upon
us
with
the
power
of
august
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
fresh
breeze
that
blew
up
from
the
creek
we
should
have
found
it
very
oppressive
we
returned
just
in
time
to
rest
for
dinner
the
is
spacious
and
cheerful
and
the
company
are
seated
at
small
tables
forming
social
groups
and
parties
the
fare
was
about
the
same
as
would
be
found
in
a
at
the
north
the
house
is
furnished
throughout
in
a
very
agreeable
style
and
an
invalid
could
nowhere
in
florida
have
more
comforts
it
is
more
than
full
and
constantly
obliged
to
turn
away
applicants
and
we
understand
that
families
are
now
waiting
at
green
cove
for
places
to
be
vacated
here
we
are
told
that
it
is
in
contemplation
another
season
to
put
up
several
cottages
to
be
rented
to
families
who
will
board
at
the
hotel
at
present
there
is
connected
with
the
establishment
one
house
and
a
cottage
where
some
of
the
guests
have
their
rooms
and
as
the
weather
is
so
generally
mild
even
invalids
find
no
objection
to
walking
to
their
meals
the
house
is
a
respectable
structure
and
being
away
from
the
main
building
is
preferred
by
some
who
feel
the
need
of
more
entire
quiet
sitting
on
the
front
steps
in
the
warm
afternoon
sunshine
and
looking
across
to
the
distant
hazy
shores
miles
away
one
could
fancy
one
self
in
italy
an
illusion
which
the
great
clumps
of
aloes
and
the
tall
green
yuccas
and
the
help
to
carry
out
groups
of
ladies
were
seated
here
and
there
under
trees
reading
working
and
chatting
we
were
called
off
by
the
of
a
the
is
under
the
shade
of
a
fine
grove
of
which
with
their
swaying
drapery
of
white
moss
form
a
graceful
shade
and
shelter
we
shared
the
honor
of
gaining
a
victory
or
two
under
the
banner
of
a
doctor
of
divinity
accustomed
we
believe
to
winning
laurels
on
quite
other
fields
in
the
good
city
of
new
york
it
has
been
our
general
experience
however
that
a
man
good
for
any
thing
else
is
commonly
a
good
we
would
notify
your
that
if
ever
he
plays
a
game
against
c
he
will
find
a
foeman
worthy
of
his
steel
in
the
evening
the
whole
company
gathered
in
the
parlors
made
cheerful
by
blazing
there
were
and
charades
and
games
to
pass
the
time
withal
and
all
bore
testimony
to
the
very
sociable
and
agreeable
manner
in
which
life
moved
on
in
their
circle
magnolia
is
about
of
a
mile
from
springs
where
are
two
or
three
large
there
is
a
very
pleasant
shady
walk
through
the
woods
from
one
place
to
the
other
and
the
mail
comes
every
day
to
green
cove
and
is
sent
for
from
the
magnolia
house
in
a
daily
morning
carriage
it
is
one
of
the
amusements
of
the
guests
to
ride
over
on
these
occasions
for
a
little
morning
gossip
and
shopping
as
magnolia
being
quite
sequestered
does
not
present
the
opportunity
to
chaffer
even
for
a
stick
of
candy
of
course
fair
ones
that
have
been
accustomed
to
the
periodical
excitement
of
a
would
sink
into
atrophy
without
an
opportunity
to
spend
something
what
they
can
buy
at
green
cove
is
a
matter
of
indifference
it
is
the
burning
of
money
in
idle
purses
that
injures
the
nervous
system
there
are
no
on
this
side
of
the
river
the
about
the
house
are
entirely
of
the
wild
kind
and
for
merely
ornamental
purposes
no
tree
more
beautiful
could
be
devised
its
vivid
green
the
deep
of
its
clusters
of
fruit
and
the
exuberance
with
which
it
blossoms
all
go
to
recommend
it
formerly
there
were
extensive
with
thousands
of
bearing
trees
on
this
side
of
the
river
the
frost
of
killed
the
trees
and
they
have
never
been
reset
oranges
are
not
therefore
either
cheap
or
plenty
at
magnolia
or
green
cove
nothing
shows
more
strikingly
the
want
of
enterprise
that
has
characterized
this
country
than
this
seedling
oranges
planted
the
very
next
day
after
the
great
frost
would
have
been
in
bearing
ten
years
after
and
would
ere
now
have
yielded
barrels
and
barrels
of
fruit
and
the
trees
would
have
grown
and
taken
care
of
themselves
one
would
have
thought
so
very
simple
and
easy
a
measure
would
have
been
adopted
at
eleven
the
next
morning
we
took
steamer
for
mandarin
and
went
skimming
along
the
shores
watching
the
amid
the
green
of
the
forest
we
stopped
at
hibernia
a
pleasant
on
an
island
called
fleming
after
a
rich
fleming
who
formerly
had
a
handsome
plantation
there
there
is
a
fine
embowered
in
trees
and
with
shaded
verandas
where
about
forty
boarders
are
yearly
accommodated
we
have
heard
this
resort
very
highly
praised
as
a
quiet
spot
where
the
accommodations
are
homelike
and
comfortable
it
is
kept
by
the
widow
of
the
former
proprietor
and
we
are
told
that
guests
who
once
go
there
return
year
after
year
there
is
something
certainly
very
peaceful
and
attractive
about
its
surroundings
but
now
our
boat
is
once
more
drawing
up
to
the
wharf
at
mandarin
and
we
must
defer
much
that
we
have
to
say
till
next
week
phoebus
we
are
happy
to
say
to
our
girl
correspondents
is
bright
and
happy
and
in
excellent
voice
all
day
long
at
intervals
we
can
hear
him
from
the
back
veranda
shouting
what
cheer
what
cheer
or
sometimes
abbreviating
it
as
cheer
cheer
cheer
since
we
have
been
writing
one
of
those
characteristic
changes
have
come
up
to
which
this
latitude
is
subject
the
sun
was
shining
the
river
blue
the
windows
open
and
the
family
reading
writing
and
working
on
the
veranda
when
suddenly
comes
a
frown
of
nature
a
black
scowl
in
the
horizon
up
flies
the
wind
the
waves
are
all
the
blinds
bang
the
windows
rattle
every
one
runs
to
shut
every
thing
and
for
a
few
moments
it
blows
as
if
it
would
take
house
and
all
away
down
drop
oranges
in
a
golden
shower
here
there
and
everywhere
the
lightning
flashes
thunder
cracks
and
rattles
and
rolls
and
the
big
torrents
of
rain
come
pouring
down
but
in
the
phoebus
between
each
clap
persists
in
shouting
what
cheer
what
cheer
like
a
woman
in
a
passion
nature
ends
all
this
with
a
burst
of
tears
and
it
is
raining
now
tenderly
and
plaintively
as
if
bemoaning
itself
well
we
would
have
missed
the
sight
if
we
had
been
asked
and
we
have
picked
up
a
bushel
of
oranges
that
otherwise
somebody
must
have
climbed
the
trees
for
meanwhile
the
mail
is
closing
illustration
yellow
jessamines
mandarin
march
they
talk
about
florida
being
the
land
of
flowers
i
sure
see
where
the
flowers
are
the
speaker
was
a
trim
young
lady
with
pretty
boots
attired
in
all
those
charming
mysteries
behind
and
before
and
up
and
down
that
make
the
daughter
of
eve
look
like
some
bright
strange
tropical
bird
she
had
come
to
see
florida
that
is
to
take
board
at
the
james
she
had
provided
herself
with
half
a
dozen
different
an
cane
tipped
with
an
alligator
tooth
together
with
an
assortment
of
cranes
wings
and
pink
curlews
feathers
and
talked
of
florida
with
the
assured
air
of
a
connoisseur
she
had
been
on
the
boat
up
to
enterprise
she
had
crossed
at
tekoi
over
to
augustine
and
come
back
to
the
james
and
was
now
prepared
to
speak
as
one
having
authority
and
she
was
sure
she
did
not
see
why
it
was
called
a
land
of
flowers
had
seen
any
but
my
dear
creature
have
you
ever
been
where
they
grow
have
you
walked
in
the
woods
walked
in
the
woods
gracious
me
of
course
not
who
could
walk
in
sand
half
up
to
one
ankles
i
tried
once
and
the
sand
got
into
my
boots
and
soiled
my
stockings
besides
i
afraid
of
snakes
then
my
dear
you
will
never
be
a
judge
on
the
question
whether
florida
is
or
is
not
a
land
of
flowers
whoever
would
judge
on
that
question
must
make
up
her
mind
to
good
long
tramps
in
the
woods
must
wear
stout
boots
with
or
better
still
high
boots
so
equipped
and
with
eyes
open
to
see
what
is
to
be
seen
you
will
be
prepared
to
explore
those
wild
glades
and
mysterious
shadows
where
nature
beauties
marvels
and
mysteries
are
wrought
the
venus
of
these
woods
is
only
unveiled
in
their
deepest
solitudes
for
ourselves
we
claim
to
have
experience
in
this
matter
of
flowers
having
always
observed
them
in
all
lands
we
were
impressed
more
by
the
of
italy
than
by
any
thing
else
there
yes
more
than
by
the
the
statues
the
old
ruins
the
sight
of
the
green
lawns
of
the
pamfili
doria
all
bubbling
up
in
little
anemones
the
cool
dells
where
we
picked
great
violets
the
damp
mossy
shadows
in
the
quirinal
gardens
where
cyclamen
grow
in
crimson
clouds
amid
a
crush
of
precious
old
marbles
and
antiques
the
lovely
flowers
unnamed
of
botany
but
which
we
should
call
a
sort
of
glorified
daisies
that
we
gathered
in
the
shadowy
dells
near
castle
gandolpho
these
have
a
freshness
in
our
memory
that
will
last
when
the
memory
of
all
the
stun
images
of
the
vatican
has
passed
away
in
our
mind
eye
we
have
compared
florida
with
italy
often
and
asked
if
it
can
equal
it
the
flowers
here
are
not
the
same
it
is
true
the
blue
violets
are
not
fragrant
we
do
not
find
the
anemones
nor
the
cyclamen
both
can
be
planted
out
here
and
will
grow
readily
but
they
are
not
flowers
not
indigenous
well
then
are
there
others
to
compensate
we
should
say
so
the
yellow
jessamine
itself
in
its
wild
grace
with
its
breath
its
profuse
abundance
is
more
than
a
substitute
for
the
anemones
of
italy
if
you
will
venture
to
walk
a
little
way
in
the
sand
beyond
our
we
will
show
you
a
this
morning
such
as
chiswick
or
the
crystal
palace
can
not
equal
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
we
walk
and
then
we
turn
in
to
what
is
called
here
an
which
is
being
interpreted
a
grove
of
with
an
underbrush
of
cedar
holly
and
various
an
effort
has
been
made
to
clear
up
this
hammock
the
larger
trees
have
some
of
them
been
cut
down
but
not
removed
the
work
of
clearing
was
abandoned
and
the
place
being
left
to
nature
she
proceeded
to
improve
and
beautify
it
after
a
fashion
of
her
own
the
yellow
jessamine
which
before
grew
under
the
shadow
of
the
trees
now
exultant
in
the
sunshine
which
was
let
in
upon
it
has
made
a
triumphant
and
abounding
growth
such
as
we
never
saw
anywhere
else
it
is
the
very
ariel
of
flowers
the
tricksy
sprite
full
of
life
and
grace
and
sweetness
and
it
seems
to
take
a
capricious
pleasure
in
rambling
everywhere
and
masquerading
in
the
foliage
of
every
kind
of
tree
now
its
yellow
bells
twinkle
down
like
stars
from
the
prickly
foliage
of
the
holly
where
it
has
taken
full
possession
turning
the
solemn
old
evergreen
into
a
blossoming
garland
now
sure
enough
looking
up
full
sixty
feet
into
yonder
we
see
it
peeping
down
at
us
in
long
festoons
mingling
with
the
swaying
crapy
streamers
of
the
gray
moss
yonder
a
little
has
been
so
completely
possessed
and
beflowered
that
it
shows
a
head
of
blossoms
as
round
as
an
in
may
you
look
below
and
jessamine
is
trailing
all
over
the
ground
weaving
and
matting
with
its
golden
buds
and
open
bells
peeping
up
at
you
from
the
and
here
is
a
tree
overthrown
and
raising
its
gaunt
knotted
branches
in
air
veiled
with
soft
mossy
drapery
the
jessamine
springs
upon
it
for
a
trellis
it
weaves
over
and
under
and
around
it
throws
off
long
sprays
and
streamers
with
two
golden
buds
at
the
axil
of
every
green
leaf
and
fluttering
out
against
the
blue
of
the
sky
its
multiform
sprays
twist
and
knot
and
tie
themselves
in
wonderful
intricacies
and
still
where
every
green
leaf
starts
is
a
yellow
the
beauty
of
these
buds
is
peculiar
they
have
little
sculptured
grooves
and
the
whole
looks
as
if
it
might
have
been
carved
of
fairy
chrysolite
for
a
lady
our
little
brown
chambermaid
wears
them
dangling
in
her
ears
and
a
very
pretty
picture
she
makes
with
them
frank
looks
admiringly
after
her
as
she
trips
by
with
them
shaking
and
twinkling
to
his
confusion
as
he
forgets
for
a
moment
to
saw
wood
and
looks
longingly
after
her
no
use
frank
trust
her
not
she
is
fooling
thee
her
smiles
are
all
for
beaux
but
still
she
wears
yellow
jessamine
in
her
crapy
hair
and
orders
frank
to
bring
her
wreaths
and
sprays
of
it
whenever
she
wants
it
and
frank
obeys
female
sovereignty
the
world
over
in
this
same
hammock
are
certain
tall
graceful
shrubs
belonging
as
we
fancy
to
the
tribe
but
which
the
floridians
call
sparkleberry
it
is
the
most
beautiful
white
ornamental
shrub
we
have
ever
seen
imagine
a
shrub
with
vivid
green
foliage
hanging
profusely
with
wreaths
of
and
you
have
as
near
as
possible
an
idea
of
the
sparkleberry
it
is
only
in
bud
now
being
a
little
later
than
the
jessamine
and
coming
into
its
glory
when
the
jessamine
is
passing
away
the
regular
employment
now
of
every
afternoon
is
to
go
out
in
the
with
old
fly
into
the
woods
it
is
as
lovely
an
as
heart
could
wish
the
sky
is
so
blue
the
air
so
balmy
and
at
every
step
there
is
something
new
to
admire
the
of
the
first
leaves
and
tags
and
of
the
deciduous
trees
has
a
vividness
and
brilliancy
peculiar
to
these
regions
the
we
have
been
describing
as
the
haunt
of
yellow
jessamine
is
as
picturesque
and
beautiful
a
as
an
artist
could
desire
there
are
tall
dark
cedars
in
which
the
gray
films
of
the
long
moss
have
a
peculiarly
light
and
airy
appearance
there
is
the
majestic
dome
of
the
southern
pine
rising
high
over
all
the
other
trees
as
in
italy
the
its
leaves
are
from
twelve
to
eighteen
inches
long
and
the
swaying
of
such
pines
makes
a
worth
listening
to
the
is
throwing
out
its
bright
young
leaves
of
a
green
and
the
whose
leaves
are
falling
now
is
bursting
into
little
velvety
tags
premonitory
of
new
foliage
four
species
of
oaks
we
notice
the
the
and
a
species
of
which
they
call
the
oak
are
all
evergreens
and
have
narrow
smooth
leaves
then
there
are
what
are
familiarly
called
a
deciduous
oak
which
bears
a
large
indented
leaf
of
a
character
resembling
our
northern
ones
besides
these
the
with
its
curiously
knobbed
and
pointed
branches
and
its
graceful
feathery
leaves
forms
a
feature
in
the
scene
underneath
great
clumps
of
are
throwing
out
their
queer
buds
to
be
in
turn
followed
by
bright
yellow
blossoms
to
an
uninstructed
eye
the
in
which
we
ride
look
like
a
flat
monotonous
scene
the
pines
rise
seventy
eighty
and
a
hundred
feet
in
the
air
so
that
their
tops
are
far
above
and
cast
no
shade
this
is
a
consideration
of
value
however
for
a
winter
ride
for
one
enjoys
the
calm
sunshine
even
in
days
when
high
winds
are
prevailing
along
the
the
depth
of
these
is
calm
sunny
and
still
and
one
can
always
have
a
pleasant
walk
there
when
the
hotter
months
come
on
the
and
have
thick
new
foliage
and
the
and
hickory
and
trees
throw
out
their
shade
to
shelter
the
traveller
every
mile
or
two
our
path
is
traversed
by
a
brook
on
its
way
to
the
john
the
natives
here
call
a
brook
a
branch
and
a
branch
is
no
small
circumstance
since
all
the
finest
trees
and
shrubbery
grow
upon
its
banks
you
can
look
through
the
high
open
pillars
of
the
and
watch
the
course
of
a
branch
half
a
mile
from
you
by
the
gorgeous
vegetation
of
the
trees
which
line
its
shores
we
jog
along
in
our
admiring
every
thing
as
we
go
we
are
constantly
exclaiming
at
something
and
tempted
to
get
out
to
gather
flowers
here
and
there
through
the
long
come
perfect
gushes
of
blue
and
white
violets
the
blue
violets
are
large
and
of
necessity
are
obliged
to
put
forth
very
long
stems
to
get
above
the
coarse
matted
grass
the
white
are
very
fragrant
and
perfectly
whiten
the
ground
in
some
moist
places
there
is
a
large
fragrant
kind
very
scarce
and
rare
but
of
which
we
have
secured
several
roots
we
are
going
this
afternoon
to
the
second
branch
after
azaleas
we
stop
at
a
little
distance
when
its
wall
of
glossy
verdure
rises
up
before
us
there
is
no
accomplishment
of
a
mule
in
which
fly
is
better
versed
than
stopping
and
standing
still
we
fancy
that
we
hear
him
in
his
inner
consciousness
making
a
merit
of
it
as
we
all
do
of
our
pet
virtues
he
is
none
of
your
frisky
fellows
always
wanting
to
be
going
and
endangering
everybody
that
wants
to
get
in
or
out
with
prances
and
curvets
not
he
he
is
a
beast
that
may
be
trusted
to
stand
for
any
length
of
time
without
an
attempt
at
motion
catch
running
away
so
we
leave
fly
and
determine
to
explore
the
branch
the
short
palmettoes
here
are
grown
to
the
height
of
fifteen
feet
their
roots
look
like
great
scaly
serpents
which
after
knotting
and
convoluting
a
while
suddenly
raise
their
crests
high
in
air
and
burst
forth
into
a
graceful
crest
of
waving
green
fans
these
waving
clumps
of
leaves
are
the
first
and
peculiar
feature
of
the
foliage
along
the
shore
here
clumps
of
pale
pink
azaleas
grow
high
up
and
fill
the
air
with
sweetness
it
is
for
azaleas
we
are
come
and
so
we
tread
our
way
cautiously
cautiously
because
we
have
heard
tales
of
the
fearful
gnome
said
to
infest
damp
places
and
banks
of
rivers
in
all
our
floridian
rambles
we
never
yet
have
got
sight
of
this
creature
though
we
have
explored
all
the
moist
places
and
sedgy
swampy
dells
where
azaleas
and
blue
iris
and
white
lilies
grow
but
the
tradition
that
such
things
are
inspires
a
wholesome
care
never
to
set
a
foot
down
without
looking
exactly
where
it
goes
the
branch
we
find
is
lighted
up
in
many
places
by
the
white
showy
blossoms
of
the
dogwood
of
which
also
we
gather
great
store
we
pile
in
flowers
azalea
and
dogwood
till
our
wagon
is
full
and
then
proceed
with
a
trowel
to
take
up
many
nameless
beauties
there
is
one
which
grows
on
a
high
slender
stalk
resembling
in
its
form
a
primrose
that
has
the
purest
and
intensest
yellow
that
we
ever
saw
in
a
flower
there
is
a
purple
variety
of
the
same
species
that
grows
in
the
same
neighborhoods
we
have
made
a
bed
of
these
woodland
beauties
at
the
roots
of
our
great
oak
so
that
they
may
finish
their
growth
and
seed
if
possible
under
our
own
eye
by
the
by
we
take
this
occasion
to
tell
the
lady
who
writes
to
beg
of
us
to
send
her
some
seeds
or
roots
of
florida
plants
or
flowers
that
we
have
put
her
letter
on
file
and
perhaps
some
day
may
find
something
to
send
her
any
one
who
loves
flowers
touches
a
kindred
spot
in
our
heart
the
difficulty
with
all
these
flowers
and
roots
sent
north
is
that
they
need
the
heat
of
this
climate
to
bring
them
to
perfection
still
there
is
no
saying
what
a
real
may
do
in
coaxing
along
exotics
the
run
we
have
been
exploring
has
we
are
told
in
the
season
of
them
beautiful
blue
wisteria
climbing
from
branch
to
branch
it
does
not
come
till
after
the
yellow
jessamine
is
gone
the
and
a
species
of
also
grow
here
and
in
a
little
time
will
be
in
full
flower
one
of
our
party
called
us
into
the
run
and
bade
us
admire
a
beautiful
shrub
some
fifteen
feet
high
whose
curious
leaves
were
shining
with
that
glossy
polish
which
gives
such
brilliance
its
leaves
were
of
waxen
thickness
its
habit
of
growth
peculiarly
graceful
and
our
colored
handmaiden
who
knows
the
habits
of
every
plant
in
our
vicinity
tells
us
that
it
bears
a
white
sweet
blossom
some
weeks
later
we
mentally
resolve
to
appropriate
this
fair
daphne
of
the
woods
on
the
first
opportunity
when
hands
can
be
spared
to
take
it
up
and
transport
it
but
now
the
sun
falls
west
and
we
plod
homeward
if
you
want
to
see
a
new
and
peculiar
beauty
watch
a
golden
sunset
through
a
grove
draperied
with
gray
moss
the
swaying
filmy
bands
turn
golden
and
and
the
long
swaying
avenues
are
like
a
scene
in
fairyland
we
come
home
and
disembark
our
treasures
our
house
looks
like
a
perfect
every
available
vase
and
jar
is
full
dogwood
azaleas
blue
iris
wreaths
of
yellow
jessamine
blue
and
white
violets
and
the
golden
unknown
which
we
christen
primroses
the
daily
sorting
of
the
vases
is
no
small
charge
but
there
is
a
hand
to
that
department
which
never
neglects
and
so
we
breathe
their
air
and
refresh
our
eyes
with
their
beauty
daily
your
cold
northern
hold
back
our
spring
the
appear
but
hang
back
they
are
three
weeks
later
than
usual
our
letters
tell
us
frightful
stories
of
thermometers
no
end
of
the
way
below
zero
when
you
have
a
we
have
a
cold
rain
so
you
must
keep
bright
lookout
on
your
ways
up
there
or
we
shall
get
no
we
have
received
several
letters
containing
questions
about
florida
it
is
our
intention
to
devote
our
next
paper
to
answering
these
we
are
perfectly
ready
to
answer
any
number
of
inquiries
so
long
as
we
can
lump
them
all
together
and
answer
them
through
the
christian
union
one
class
of
letters
however
we
can
not
too
thankfully
remember
those
who
have
read
our
papers
with
so
much
of
sympathy
as
to
send
in
contributions
to
our
church
here
have
done
us
great
good
we
have
now
a
sum
contributed
with
which
we
hope
soon
to
replace
our
loss
and
now
as
the
mail
is
closing
we
must
close
we
wish
you
could
see
a
gigantic
bouquet
that
s
has
just
brought
in
from
the
hummock
a
little
about
five
feet
high
whose
spreading
top
is
all
a
golden
mass
of
bloom
with
yellow
jessamine
he
has
cut
down
and
borne
home
in
triumph
what
an
adornment
would
this
be
for
one
of
the
gigantic
japanese
vases
that
figure
in
what
would
such
a
bouquet
sell
for
illustration
florida
for
invalids
we
find
an
aggrieved
feeling
in
the
minds
of
the
floridian
public
in
view
of
a
letter
in
the
independent
by
headed
as
above
and
we
have
been
urgently
requested
to
say
something
on
the
other
view
of
the
question
little
did
we
suppose
when
we
met
our
good
friend
at
magnolia
apparently
in
the
height
of
spirits
the
life
of
the
establishment
and
head
promoter
of
all
sorts
of
hilarity
that
under
all
this
delightful
cheerfulness
he
was
contending
with
such
dreary
experiences
as
his
article
in
the
independent
would
lead
one
to
suppose
really
any
one
who
should
know
the
doctor
only
from
that
article
might
mistake
him
for
a
wretched
hypochondriac
whereas
we
saw
him
and
heard
of
him
by
universal
repute
at
magnolia
as
one
of
the
cheeriest
and
sunniest
of
the
inmates
taking
every
thing
by
the
smoothest
handle
and
not
only
looking
on
the
bright
side
himself
but
making
everybody
else
do
the
same
imagine
therefore
our
utter
astonishment
at
finding
our
buoyant
doctor
summing
up
his
florida
experience
in
such
paragraphs
as
these
from
what
i
have
observed
i
should
think
florida
was
water
and
the
other
tenth
swamp
many
are
deceived
by
the
milder
climate
here
and
down
they
come
to
die
the
mildness
too
is
exaggerated
yesterday
morning
the
thermometer
was
at
degrees
outside
our
winter
overcoats
were
necessary
and
great
roared
within
now
and
then
the
thermometer
reaches
eighty
degrees
at
but
that
very
night
you
may
have
frost
another
fact
of
florida
is
malaria
how
could
it
be
otherwise
souse
manhattan
island
two
feet
deep
in
fresh
water
and
would
the
price
of
quinine
rise
i
have
no
objection
to
the
term
south
it
is
a
pretty
alliteration
but
i
object
to
its
application
to
georgia
and
florida
in
february
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
me
last
friday
night
we
were
riding
two
hundred
and
sixty
miles
through
a
swamp
okefinokee
of
the
geographies
i
was
clad
in
full
winter
suit
with
heavy
russian
overcoat
but
a
careful
comparison
of
the
incidents
in
his
letter
solves
the
mystery
the
letter
was
written
in
an
early
date
in
the
floridian
experience
and
before
he
had
had
an
opportunity
of
experiencing
the
benefit
which
he
subsequently
reaped
from
it
we
perceive
by
the
reference
to
last
friday
night
and
the
ride
through
okefinokee
swamp
that
the
doctor
was
then
fresh
from
the
north
and
undergoing
that
process
of
disenchantment
which
many
northern
travellers
experience
particularly
those
who
come
by
railroad
the
most
ardent
friends
of
florida
must
admit
that
this
railroad
is
by
no
means
a
prepossessing
approach
to
the
land
of
promise
and
the
midnight
cold
upon
it
is
something
likely
to
be
had
in
remembrance
when
we
crossed
it
however
we
had
a
stove
which
was
a
small
imitation
of
nebuchadnezzar
furnace
to
keep
us
in
heart
otherwise
there
is
a
great
deal
of
truth
in
our
friend
allegations
as
we
have
elsewhere
remarked
every
place
like
a
bit
of
tapestry
has
its
right
side
and
its
wrong
side
and
both
are
true
and
real
the
wrong
side
with
its
tags
and
rags
and
seams
and
knots
and
thrums
of
worsted
and
the
right
side
with
its
pretty
picture
it
is
true
as
the
doctor
says
that
some
invalids
do
come
here
expose
themselves
imprudently
and
die
people
do
die
in
florida
if
they
use
the
means
quite
as
successfully
as
in
new
york
it
is
true
that
sometimes
the
thermometer
stands
at
seventy
at
noon
and
that
the
nights
are
much
cooler
it
is
true
we
have
sometimes
severe
frosts
in
florida
it
is
true
we
have
malaria
it
is
true
that
there
are
swamps
in
florida
and
it
is
quite
apt
to
be
true
that
if
a
man
rides
a
hundred
miles
through
a
swamp
at
night
he
will
feel
pretty
chilly
all
these
are
undeniable
truths
we
never
pretended
that
florida
was
the
kingdom
of
heaven
or
the
land
where
they
shall
no
more
say
i
am
sick
it
is
quite
the
reverse
people
this
very
winter
have
in
our
neighborhood
had
severe
attacks
of
pneumonia
and
undoubtedly
many
have
come
to
florida
seeking
health
and
have
not
found
it
yet
on
the
other
hand
there
are
now
living
in
florida
many
old
established
citizens
and
who
came
here
ten
twenty
and
thirty
years
ago
given
over
in
consumption
who
have
here
for
years
enjoyed
a
happy
and
vigorous
life
in
spite
of
okefinokee
swamp
and
the
malaria
undoubtedly
the
country
would
be
much
better
to
live
in
if
there
were
no
swamps
and
no
malaria
and
so
also
new
england
would
be
better
to
live
in
if
there
were
not
six
months
winter
and
three
more
months
of
cold
weather
there
as
to
malaria
it
is
not
necessary
to
souse
manhattan
island
under
water
to
get
that
in
and
around
new
york
the
new
lands
in
new
york
will
give
you
chills
and
fever
quite
as
well
as
florida
you
can
find
malarial
fevers
almost
anywhere
in
the
towns
between
new
york
and
new
haven
and
it
is
notorious
that
many
estates
in
the
vicinity
of
new
york
and
philadelphia
sell
cheap
on
that
very
account
because
they
are
almost
as
malarious
as
some
italian
villas
florida
is
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
yet
although
it
has
its
share
of
that
malaria
which
attends
the
development
of
land
in
a
new
country
but
the
malarial
fevers
here
are
of
a
mild
type
and
easily
managed
and
they
are
generally
confined
to
the
fall
months
the
situation
of
florida
surrounded
by
the
sea
and
the
free
sweep
of
winds
across
it
temper
the
air
and
blow
away
malarious
gases
in
regard
to
consumptives
and
all
other
invalids
the
influence
of
a
floridian
climate
depends
very
much
on
the
nature
of
the
case
and
the
constitution
of
the
individual
if
persons
suffer
constitutionally
from
cold
if
they
are
bright
and
well
only
in
hot
weather
if
the
winter
chills
and
benumbs
them
till
in
the
spring
they
are
in
the
condition
of
a
plant
alive
to
be
sure
but
with
every
leaf
gone
then
these
persons
may
be
quite
sure
that
they
will
be
the
better
for
a
winter
in
florida
and
better
still
if
they
can
take
up
their
abode
there
but
if
on
the
contrary
persons
are
debilitated
and
wretched
during
hot
weather
and
if
cool
weather
braces
them
and
gives
them
vigor
and
life
then
such
evidently
have
no
call
to
florida
and
should
be
booked
for
minnesota
or
some
other
dry
cold
climate
there
are
consumptives
belonging
to
both
these
classes
of
constitution
and
the
coming
of
one
of
the
wrong
kind
to
florida
is
of
no
use
to
himself
and
is
sure
to
bring
discredit
on
the
country
a
little
good
common
sense
and
reflection
will
settle
that
matter
again
there
is
a
form
of
what
passes
for
consumption
which
is
after
all
some
modification
of
and
so
far
as
we
have
heard
or
observed
florida
is
no
place
for
these
cases
the
diseases
here
are
of
the
bilious
type
and
those
who
have
are
apt
to
grow
worse
rather
than
better
but
there
are
classes
of
persons
on
whom
the
climate
of
florida
acts
like
a
charm
there
are
certain
dyspeptics
who
require
a
great
deal
of
open
life
they
are
in
comfortable
health
during
those
months
when
they
can
spend
half
their
time
in
the
open
air
they
have
no
particular
disease
but
they
have
no
great
reserved
strength
and
can
not
battle
with
severe
weather
they
can
not
go
out
in
snow
or
wind
or
on
chilly
stormy
days
without
risking
more
harm
than
they
get
good
such
in
our
northern
climate
are
kept
close
prisoners
for
six
months
from
december
to
may
they
are
shut
in
to
houses
or
stoves
the
winter
is
one
long
struggle
to
keep
themselves
up
for
want
of
the
exercise
which
sustains
them
in
summer
appetite
and
sleep
both
fail
them
they
have
restless
nights
and
bad
digestion
and
look
anxiously
to
the
end
of
winter
as
the
only
relief
for
such
how
slowly
it
drags
they
watch
the
almanac
the
sun
crosses
the
line
the
days
grow
a
minute
longer
spring
will
come
by
and
by
but
by
what
cruel
irony
was
the
month
of
march
ever
called
spring
march
which
piles
and
on
backs
almost
broken
by
endurance
the
long
agony
of
march
and
april
is
the
with
many
a
delicate
person
who
has
borne
pretty
well
the
regular
winter
said
one
who
did
much
work
i
bear
it
pretty
well
through
december
i
do
so
much
mind
january
february
tires
me
a
little
but
i
face
it
bravely
but
by
march
i
begin
to
say
if
this
do
stop
pretty
soon
shall
i
ca
get
much
farther
but
our
heaviest
and
most
savage
cold
are
often
reserved
for
march
and
to
many
an
invalid
it
has
given
the
final
thrust
it
is
the
last
straw
that
breaks
the
camel
back
but
after
march
in
new
england
comes
april
utterly
untrustworthy
and
with
no
assured
life
for
a
delicate
person
as
to
the
month
of
may
the
poet
cowper
has
a
lively
poem
ridiculing
the
poets
who
have
made
the
charms
of
may
the
subject
of
their
songs
mother
nature
is
represented
as
thus
addressing
them
you
have
thus
combined
she
said
favorite
nymph
to
slight
adorning
may
that
peevish
maid
with
june
undoubted
right
the
minx
cursed
for
your
folly
sake
shall
prove
herself
a
shrew
shall
make
your
scribbling
fingers
ache
and
bite
your
noses
blue
which
she
generally
does
so
it
is
not
really
till
june
that
persons
or
persons
of
impaired
vigor
really
feel
themselves
out
of
prison
they
have
then
about
five
months
at
most
in
which
they
can
live
an
life
before
the
close
on
them
again
now
the
persons
who
would
be
most
benefited
by
coming
to
florida
are
not
the
desperately
diseased
the
confirmed
consumptives
but
those
of
such
impaired
physical
vigor
that
they
are
in
danger
of
becoming
so
an
ounce
of
prevention
here
is
worth
many
pounds
of
cure
it
is
too
often
the
case
that
the
care
and
expense
that
might
have
prevented
disease
from
settling
are
spent
in
vain
after
it
has
once
fastened
sad
it
is
indeed
to
see
the
wan
and
wasted
faces
and
hear
the
hollow
of
those
who
have
been
brought
here
too
late
yet
in
hundreds
of
instances
yes
in
thousands
where
one
more
severe
northern
winter
would
have
fastened
disease
on
the
vitals
a
winter
in
a
southern
climate
has
broken
the
spell
the
climate
of
florida
is
also
of
peculiar
advantage
in
all
diseases
attended
by
nervous
excitability
the
air
is
peculiarly
soothing
and
tranquillizing
it
is
the
veritable
paradise
full
of
quiet
and
repose
we
have
known
cases
where
the
sleeplessness
of
years
has
given
way
under
this
balmy
influence
to
the
most
childlike
habit
of
slumber
for
debility
and
the
complaints
that
spring
from
debility
florida
is
not
so
good
a
refuge
perhaps
as
some
more
northern
point
like
aiken
the
air
here
is
soothing
but
not
particularly
bracing
it
builds
up
and
strengthens
not
by
any
tonic
effect
in
itself
so
much
as
by
the
opportunity
for
constant
life
and
exercise
which
it
affords
for
children
the
climate
can
not
be
too
much
praised
in
our
little
neighborhood
are
seven
about
as
lively
youngsters
as
could
often
be
met
with
and
the
winter
has
been
one
long
there
has
not
been
a
cough
nor
a
cold
nor
an
ailment
of
any
kind
and
scarce
an
anxiety
all
day
long
we
hear
their
running
and
racing
down
to
the
in
the
boats
which
they
manage
as
dexterously
as
little
fishing
catching
crabs
or
off
after
flowers
in
the
woods
with
no
trouble
of
hail
sleet
or
wet
feet
truly
it
is
a
child
eden
and
they
grow
and
thrive
accordingly
now
as
to
malaria
that
is
a
word
requiring
consideration
to
those
who
expect
to
make
florida
a
permanent
home
but
having
no
terrors
for
those
who
come
to
spend
winters
merely
there
is
no
malaria
in
winter
and
c
may
be
consoled
in
reflecting
that
frost
always
destroys
it
so
that
when
the
thermometer
is
as
he
says
at
degrees
there
is
no
danger
even
though
one
be
in
the
same
state
with
forty
swamps
in
fact
for
ourselves
we
prefer
a
cool
winter
such
as
this
has
been
an
winter
when
it
is
warm
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
one
can
enjoy
a
bright
fire
on
the
hearth
morning
and
night
is
the
most
favorable
to
exercise
and
to
health
but
merely
to
come
to
florida
and
idle
away
time
at
the
james
or
the
augustine
hotel
taking
no
regular
exercise
and
having
no
employment
for
mind
or
body
is
no
way
to
improve
by
being
here
it
is
because
the
climate
gives
opportunity
of
exercise
that
it
is
so
favorable
but
if
one
neglects
all
these
opportunities
he
may
gain
very
little
it
can
not
be
too
often
impressed
on
strangers
coming
here
that
what
cold
there
is
will
be
more
keenly
felt
than
in
a
northern
climate
persons
should
vary
their
clothing
carefully
to
the
varying
temperature
and
be
quite
as
careful
to
go
warmly
clad
as
in
colder
states
in
our
houses
at
the
north
we
generally
wear
thick
woollen
dresses
and
and
keep
up
a
temperature
of
from
seventy
to
eighty
degrees
in
the
south
we
move
in
a
much
lower
temperature
and
have
only
the
open
fire
upon
the
hearth
it
is
therefore
important
to
go
warmly
clad
and
particularly
to
keep
on
flannels
until
the
warm
weather
of
april
becomes
a
settled
thing
in
regard
to
the
healthfulness
of
florida
some
things
are
to
be
borne
in
mind
in
a
state
that
has
the
reputation
of
being
an
asylum
many
desperate
cases
necessarily
take
refuge
and
of
course
many
die
yet
notwithstanding
the
loss
from
these
causes
the
census
of
showed
that
the
number
of
deaths
from
pulmonary
complaints
is
less
to
the
population
than
in
any
state
of
the
union
in
massachusetts
the
rate
is
one
in
two
hundred
and
in
california
one
in
seven
hundred
and
in
florida
one
in
fourteen
hundred
and
lawson
of
the
army
in
his
report
asserts
that
the
ratio
of
deaths
to
the
number
of
cases
of
remittent
fevers
has
been
much
less
among
the
troops
serving
in
florida
than
in
other
portions
of
the
united
states
in
the
middle
division
the
proportion
is
one
death
to
cases
of
fever
in
the
northern
one
to
in
texas
one
to
in
california
one
in
a
hundred
and
while
in
florida
it
is
one
in
two
hundred
and
such
statistics
as
these
are
more
reliable
than
the
limited
observation
of
any
one
individual
in
regard
to
sudden
changes
of
climate
florida
is
certainly
not
in
all
parts
ideally
perfect
there
are
at
times
great
and
sudden
changes
there
but
not
by
any
means
as
much
so
as
in
most
other
states
of
the
union
sudden
changes
from
heat
to
cold
are
the
besetting
sin
of
this
fallen
world
it
is
the
staple
subject
for
grumbling
among
the
invalids
who
visit
italy
and
in
fact
it
is
probably
one
of
the
consequences
of
adam
fall
which
we
are
not
to
be
rid
of
till
we
get
to
the
land
of
pure
delight
it
may
however
comfort
the
hearts
of
visitors
to
florida
to
know
that
if
the
climate
here
is
not
in
this
respect
just
what
they
would
have
it
it
is
about
the
best
there
is
going
all
this
will
be
made
quite
clear
to
any
one
who
will
study
the
tables
of
observations
on
temperature
contained
in
the
guide
to
florida
where
they
can
see
an
accurate
account
of
the
range
of
the
thermometer
for
five
successive
years
as
compared
with
that
in
other
states
one
thing
can
not
be
too
often
reiterated
to
people
who
come
to
florida
and
that
is
that
they
must
not
expect
at
once
to
leave
behind
them
all
sickness
sorrow
pain
inconvenience
of
any
kind
and
to
enter
at
once
on
the
rest
of
paradise
the
happiness
after
all
will
have
to
be
comparative
and
the
inconveniences
are
to
be
borne
by
reflecting
how
much
greater
inconveniences
are
avoided
for
instance
when
we
have
a
damp
drizzling
down
here
we
must
reflect
that
at
the
north
it
is
a
driving
when
it
is
brisk
cold
weather
here
it
is
an
intolerable
freeze
there
the
shadow
and
reflection
of
all
important
changes
at
the
north
travel
down
to
us
in
time
the
exceptionally
cold
winter
at
the
north
has
put
our
season
here
back
a
month
behind
its
usual
the
storms
travel
downward
coming
to
us
generally
a
little
later
and
in
a
modified
form
we
can
not
better
illustrate
this
than
by
two
experiences
this
year
easter
morning
we
were
waked
by
and
it
was
a
most
heavenly
morning
we
walked
out
in
the
calm
dewy
freshness
to
gather
flowers
to
dress
our
house
the
only
church
we
have
now
in
which
to
hold
services
in
the
low
near
our
home
is
a
perfect
field
of
blue
iris
whose
bending
leaves
were
all
beaded
with
dew
and
we
walked
in
among
them
admiring
the
wonderful
vividness
of
their
coloring
and
gathering
the
choicest
to
fill
a
large
vase
then
we
cut
verbenas
white
scarlet
and
crimson
and
myrtle
callas
and
roses
while
already
on
our
tables
were
vases
of
yellow
jessamine
gathered
the
night
before
the
blue
john
lay
in
misty
bands
of
light
and
shade
in
the
distance
and
the
and
were
singing
a
loud
now
for
the
north
a
friend
in
hartford
writes
i
was
awaked
by
the
patter
of
snow
and
sleet
on
the
not
a
creature
could
go
out
to
church
the
storm
was
so
severe
even
the
irish
were
obliged
to
keep
housed
with
all
we
could
do
with
a
furnace
and
stove
we
could
not
get
the
temperature
of
our
house
above
degrees
in
the
latter
part
of
the
day
we
at
mandarin
had
some
rough
chilling
winds
which
were
the
remains
of
the
northern
easter
storm
but
we
were
wise
enough
to
rejoice
in
the
good
we
had
instead
of
fretting
at
the
shadow
of
evil
illustration
swamps
and
march
after
a
cold
damp
rainy
week
we
have
suddenly
had
dropped
upon
us
a
balmy
warm
summer
day
thermometer
at
eighty
and
every
thing
out
of
doors
growing
so
fast
that
you
may
see
and
hear
it
grow
the
swampy
belt
of
land
in
front
of
the
house
is
now
bursting
forth
in
clouds
of
blue
iris
of
every
shade
from
the
palest
and
faintest
to
the
most
vivid
tint
the
there
are
covered
with
buds
and
the
are
lovely
with
their
vivid
little
feathers
of
verdure
this
swamp
is
one
of
those
crooks
in
our
lot
which
occasions
a
conflict
of
spirit
it
is
a
glorious
bewildering
impropriety
the
trees
and
shrubs
in
it
grow
as
if
they
were
possessed
and
there
is
scarcely
a
month
in
the
year
that
it
does
not
flame
forth
in
some
new
blossom
it
is
a
perpetual
where
creepers
run
and
tangle
where
nature
has
raptures
and
frenzies
of
growth
and
conducts
herself
like
a
crazy
drunken
but
beautiful
but
what
to
do
with
it
is
not
clear
the
river
rises
and
falls
in
it
and
under
all
that
tangle
of
foliage
lies
a
foul
sink
of
the
blackest
mud
the
black
unsavory
are
said
and
believed
to
have
their
lair
in
those
jungles
where
foot
of
man
cares
not
to
tread
gigantic
bulrushes
grow
up
clumps
of
high
willows
elms
maples
cypresses
magnolia
glauca
make
brave
show
of
foliage
below
the
blue
the
lily
the
blue
iris
blossoming
tufts
of
elder
together
with
strange
flowers
of
names
unspoken
make
a
goodly
fellowship
the
birds
herd
there
in
droves
glance
like
gems
through
the
boughs
and
sparrows
and
jays
babble
and
jargon
there
in
the
green
labyrinths
made
by
the
tangling
vines
we
muse
over
it
meanwhile
enjoying
the
visible
of
spring
in
its
foliage
the
maples
have
great
red
leaves
curling
with
their
own
rapid
growth
the
elms
feather
out
into
graceful
plumes
and
the
cypress
as
we
said
before
most
brilliant
of
all
spring
greens
puts
forth
its
fairy
foliage
verily
it
is
the
most
gorgeous
of
improprieties
this
swamp
and
we
will
let
it
alone
this
year
also
and
see
what
will
come
of
it
there
are
suggestions
of
ditching
and
draining
and
what
not
that
shall
convert
the
wild
into
a
steady
orderly
member
of
society
we
shall
see
spring
is
a
glory
anywhere
but
as
you
approach
the
tropics
there
is
a
vivid
brilliancy
a
burning
tone
to
the
coloring
that
is
peculiar
we
are
struck
with
the
beauty
of
the
we
believe
they
belong
to
the
smilax
family
and
the
kinds
that
prevail
here
are
evergreen
and
have
leaves
within
a
day
or
two
these
glossy
vines
have
thrown
out
trembling
red
sprays
shining
with
newness
with
long
tendrils
waving
in
the
air
the
vigor
of
a
red
young
shoot
that
seems
to
spring
out
in
an
hour
has
something
delightful
in
it
yellow
jessamine
alas
is
fading
the
ground
is
strewn
with
trumpets
as
if
the
elves
had
had
a
concert
and
thrown
down
their
instruments
and
fled
now
the
vines
throw
out
young
shoots
half
a
yard
long
and
infinite
in
number
and
jessamine
goes
on
to
possess
and
clothe
new
regions
which
next
february
shall
be
yellow
with
flowers
farewell
for
this
year
sweet
medea
of
the
woods
with
thy
golden
fleece
of
blossoms
why
couldst
thou
not
stay
with
us
through
the
year
emerson
says
quaintly
seventy
salads
measure
the
life
of
a
man
the
things
whether
of
flower
or
fruit
that
we
can
have
but
once
a
year
mark
off
our
lives
a
lover
might
thus
tell
the
age
of
his
seventeen
times
had
the
jessamine
blossomed
since
she
came
into
the
world
the
time
of
the
bloom
of
the
jessamine
is
about
two
months
in
the
middle
of
january
when
we
came
down
it
was
barely
budded
the
of
march
and
it
is
past
but
not
to
give
all
our
time
to
flowers
we
must
now
fulfil
our
promise
to
answer
letters
and
give
practical
information
a
gentleman
propounds
to
us
the
following
inquiry
apart
from
the
danger
from
frosts
what
is
the
prospect
of
certainty
in
the
is
it
a
steady
one
we
have
made
diligent
inquiry
from
old
experienced
cultivators
and
from
those
who
have
collected
the
traditions
of
and
the
result
seems
to
be
that
apart
from
the
danger
of
frost
the
is
the
most
steady
and
certain
of
any
known
fruit
in
regard
to
our
own
grove
consisting
of
a
hundred
and
fifteen
trees
on
an
acre
and
a
half
of
ground
we
find
that
there
has
been
an
average
crop
matured
of
sixty
thousand
a
year
for
each
of
the
five
years
we
have
had
it
two
years
the
crop
was
lost
through
sudden
frost
coming
after
it
was
fully
perfected
but
these
two
years
are
the
only
ones
since
when
a
crop
has
been
lost
or
damaged
through
frost
our
friend
inquires
with
regard
to
the
this
was
an
epidemic
which
prevailed
some
fifteen
or
twenty
years
ago
destroying
the
as
the
did
the
it
was
a
variety
of
the
but
nothing
has
been
seen
of
it
in
an
epidemic
form
for
many
years
and
growers
now
have
no
apprehensions
from
this
source
the
wonderful
vital
and
productive
power
of
the
would
not
be
marvelled
at
could
one
examine
its
roots
the
ground
all
through
our
grove
is
a
dense
mat
or
sponge
of
fine
yellow
roots
which
appear
like
a
network
on
the
least
displacing
of
the
sand
every
ramification
has
its
feeder
and
sucks
up
food
for
the
tree
with
avidity
the
consequence
is
that
people
who
have
an
must
be
contented
with
that
and
not
try
to
raise
flowers
but
nevertheless
we
do
try
because
we
ca
help
it
but
every
fertilizer
that
we
put
upon
our
roses
and
is
immediately
rushed
after
by
these
hungry
yellow
at
the
root
of
our
great
we
wanted
a
little
pet
colony
of
flowers
and
had
muck
and
manure
placed
there
to
prepare
for
them
in
digging
there
lately
we
found
every
particle
of
muck
and
manure
netted
round
with
the
fine
embracing
fibres
from
the
ten
feet
off
the
consequence
is
that
our
roses
grow
slowly
and
our
is
not
a
success
oleanders
pomegranates
and
manage
however
to
stand
their
ground
any
strong
plant
does
better
than
more
delicate
flowers
as
people
who
will
insist
upon
their
rights
and
fight
for
them
do
best
in
the
great
scramble
of
life
but
what
a
bouquet
of
sweets
is
an
merely
as
a
it
is
worth
having
if
for
nothing
else
we
call
the
time
of
their
budding
the
week
of
pearls
how
beautiful
how
almost
miraculous
the
of
these
pearls
to
gem
the
green
leaves
the
fragrance
has
a
stimulating
effect
on
our
nerves
a
sort
of
dreamy
intoxication
the
air
now
is
full
of
it
under
the
trees
the
white
drift
bearing
perfume
but
not
to
lose
our
way
in
poetic
raptures
we
return
to
statistics
drawn
from
a
recent
conversation
with
our
practical
neighbor
he
has
three
trees
in
his
grounds
which
this
year
have
each
borne
five
thousand
oranges
he
says
that
he
has
never
failed
of
a
steady
crop
from
any
cause
except
in
the
first
of
the
two
years
named
and
in
that
case
it
is
to
be
remembered
the
fruit
was
perfected
and
only
lost
by
not
being
gathered
he
stated
that
he
had
had
reports
from
two
men
whom
he
named
who
had
each
gathered
ten
thousand
from
a
single
tree
he
appeared
to
think
it
a
credible
story
though
a
very
remarkable
yield
the
orange
can
be
got
from
seed
our
neighbor
trees
the
largest
and
finest
in
mandarin
are
seedlings
like
ours
they
were
frozen
down
in
and
subsequently
almost
destroyed
by
the
but
now
they
are
stately
majestic
trees
of
wonderful
beauty
the
orange
follows
the
quality
of
the
seed
and
needs
no
budding
and
in
our
region
this
mode
of
getting
the
trees
is
universally
preferred
fruit
may
be
expected
from
the
seed
in
six
years
when
high
cultivation
is
practised
a
cultivator
in
our
neighborhood
saw
a
dozen
trees
with
an
average
of
three
hundred
oranges
on
each
at
seven
years
from
the
seed
young
seedling
plants
of
three
years
growth
can
be
bought
in
the
nurseries
on
the
john
river
our
young
folks
have
been
thrown
into
a
state
of
great
excitement
this
afternoon
by
the
introduction
among
them
of
two
live
alligators
our
friend
p
went
for
them
to
the
lair
of
the
old
alligator
which
he
describes
as
a
hole
in
the
bank
where
the
eggs
are
laid
hundreds
of
little
alligators
were
crawling
in
and
out
the
parents
letting
them
shift
for
themselves
they
feed
upon
small
fish
our
young
snapped
in
a
very
suggestive
manner
at
a
stick
offered
to
him
and
gave
an
energetic
squeak
we
pointed
out
to
the
children
that
if
it
were
their
finger
or
toe
that
was
in
the
stick
place
the
consequences
might
be
serious
after
all
we
have
small
sympathy
with
capturing
these
poor
monsters
we
shall
have
some
nice
tales
to
tell
of
them
anon
meanwhile
our
paper
must
end
here
illustration
april
our
palmetto
correspondence
increases
daily
our
mail
comes
only
twice
a
week
and
as
the
result
of
the
two
last
mails
we
find
fifteen
letters
propounding
various
inquiries
about
florida
now
it
would
be
a
most
delightful
thing
to
be
on
sociable
terms
with
all
the
world
and
we
would
be
glad
to
reply
to
each
one
of
these
letters
many
of
them
are
sprightly
and
amusing
all
are
written
in
good
faith
containing
most
natural
and
rational
inquiries
but
let
any
one
attempt
the
task
of
writing
fifteen
letters
on
one
subject
and
he
will
soon
find
that
it
is
rather
more
than
can
be
done
by
one
who
expects
to
do
any
thing
else
some
of
the
inquiries
however
we
may
as
well
dispose
of
in
the
beginning
of
this
letter
and
first
as
to
the
little
boy
who
has
lost
his
cat
and
wishes
to
know
if
we
can
not
spare
peter
to
take
her
place
alas
we
have
a
tale
of
sadness
to
unfold
when
we
began
our
we
were
the
embarrassed
possessor
of
four
thrifty
cats
now
every
one
of
them
has
passed
to
the
land
of
shades
and
we
are
absolutely
peter
we
regret
to
say
was
killed
in
consequence
of
being
mistaken
for
a
rabbit
one
moonlight
night
by
an
enterprising
young
sportsman
annie
was
unfortunately
drowned
and
fell
victim
to
some
similar
hallucination
of
the
young
who
destroyed
peter
in
short
only
our
old
family
remained
but
as
she
had
a
fine
litter
of
kittens
there
was
hope
that
the
line
would
be
continued
we
established
her
sumptuously
in
a
box
in
the
with
her
nurslings
but
as
cruel
fate
would
have
it
a
marauding
dog
came
smelling
about
and
a
fight
ensued
in
which
puss
was
broken
or
to
speak
quite
literally
chewed
up
wounded
and
bleeding
but
plucky
to
the
last
she
drove
off
the
dog
with
a
predestined
scratched
face
and
taking
up
her
kittens
one
by
one
in
her
mouth
traversed
a
long
veranda
jumped
through
a
window
into
the
of
one
of
her
mistresses
and
deposited
her
nurslings
under
the
bed
all
agreed
that
a
cat
of
such
spirit
and
gallantry
had
shown
that
she
ought
to
vote
by
her
ability
to
fight
and
that
she
was
at
least
worthy
of
distinguished
attention
so
the
next
day
the
whole
family
sat
in
council
on
the
case
chloroform
was
administered
and
while
puss
was
insensible
a
promising
young
naturalist
set
and
bandaged
the
limb
but
alas
without
avail
the
weather
was
hot
and
the
sufferings
of
the
poor
creature
soon
became
such
that
we
were
thankful
that
we
had
the
power
by
a
swift
and
painless
death
to
put
an
end
to
them
so
a
sent
puss
to
the
land
where
the
good
cats
go
and
the
motherless
kitties
found
peace
under
the
blue
waters
of
the
john
the
undoubtedly
held
up
their
pearled
wrists
and
took
them
in
and
doubtless
made
blessed
pets
of
them
so
that
is
the
end
of
all
our
cats
phoebus
rejoices
now
for
there
is
none
to
molest
or
make
him
afraid
his
songs
increase
daily
in
variety
he
pipes
and
whistles
occasionally
breaks
forth
into
a
litany
that
sounds
like
pray
do
pray
do
pray
do
then
suddenly
changing
the
stop
he
shouts
de
deevil
de
deevil
de
deevil
but
as
he
is
otherwise
a
bird
of
the
most
correct
habits
it
can
not
be
supposed
that
any
profanity
is
intended
this
morning
being
sunday
he
called
beecher
beecher
beecher
very
volubly
he
evidently
is
a
progressive
bird
and
for
aught
we
know
may
yet
express
himself
on
some
of
the
questions
of
the
day
the
next
letter
on
our
file
wants
to
know
the
prices
of
board
at
springs
magnolia
and
hibernia
the
prices
at
these
places
vary
all
the
way
from
twelve
to
dollars
per
week
according
to
accommodations
the
higher
prices
are
in
larger
hotels
and
the
smaller
in
private
the
florida
guide
says
board
can
be
obtained
in
jacksonville
in
private
families
at
from
eight
to
ten
dollars
per
week
there
are
three
more
letters
asking
questions
about
the
culture
of
the
orange
to
which
the
writers
will
find
answers
so
far
as
we
can
give
them
when
we
come
to
speak
of
the
up
the
river
a
lady
writes
to
ask
if
we
know
any
way
of
preserving
figs
practically
we
know
nothing
about
the
having
never
been
here
when
they
were
ripe
our
friends
tell
us
that
they
are
not
successful
in
preserving
them
in
cans
they
make
a
delicious
though
rather
luscious
preserve
done
in
the
ordinary
way
like
peaches
but
we
will
give
our
inquiring
friend
the
benefit
of
a
piece
of
information
communicated
to
us
by
an
old
native
floridian
who
professed
to
have
raised
and
prepared
figs
as
fine
as
those
in
turkey
his
receipt
was
as
follows
prepare
a
lye
from
the
ashes
of
the
have
a
kettle
of
this
kept
boiling
hot
over
the
fire
throw
in
the
figs
and
let
them
remain
two
minutes
skim
them
out
and
drain
them
on
a
sieve
and
afterwards
dry
in
the
sun
such
was
his
receipt
which
we
have
never
tried
probably
any
other
strong
lye
would
answer
as
well
as
that
from
the
as
to
those
who
have
asked
for
flowers
from
florida
we
wish
it
were
in
our
power
to
grant
their
requests
but
these
frail
beauties
are
not
transferable
we
in
our
colony
have
taxed
the
resources
of
our
postal
arrangements
to
carry
to
our
friends
small
specimens
but
with
no
very
encouraging
results
we
have
just
been
making
the
or
tour
up
the
john
to
enterprise
across
to
augustine
and
back
which
is
necessary
to
constitute
one
an
accomplished
floridian
and
it
had
been
our
intention
to
devote
this
letter
to
that
trip
but
there
is
so
much
to
say
there
are
so
many
wonders
and
marvels
to
be
described
that
we
must
give
it
a
letter
by
itself
no
dreamland
on
earth
can
be
more
unearthly
in
its
beauty
and
glory
than
the
john
in
april
tourists
for
the
most
part
see
it
only
in
winter
when
half
its
gorgeous
forests
stand
bare
of
leaves
and
go
home
never
dreaming
what
it
would
be
like
in
its
so
do
we
in
our
darkness
judge
the
shores
of
the
river
of
this
mortal
life
up
which
we
sail
ofttimes
disappointed
and
complaining
we
are
seeing
all
things
in
winter
and
not
as
they
will
be
when
god
shall
wipe
away
all
tears
and
bring
about
the
new
heavens
and
new
earth
of
which
every
spring
is
a
symbol
and
a
prophecy
the
flowers
and
leaves
of
last
year
vanish
for
a
season
but
they
come
back
fresher
and
fairer
than
ever
this
bright
morning
we
looked
from
the
roof
of
our
veranda
and
our
neighbor
were
glowing
like
a
great
crimson
cloud
and
we
said
there
the
oleanders
have
come
back
no
northern
ideas
can
give
the
glory
of
these
trees
as
they
raise
their
heads
in
this
their
native
land
and
seem
to
be
covered
with
great
crimson
roses
the
poor
stunted
bushes
of
northern
greenhouses
are
as
much
like
it
as
our
stunted
virtues
and
poor
enjoyments
shall
be
like
the
bloom
and
radiance
of
god
paradise
hereafter
in
april
they
begin
to
bloom
and
they
bloom
on
till
november
language
can
not
do
justice
to
the
radiance
the
brightness
the
celestial
calm
and
glory
of
these
spring
days
there
is
an
assurance
of
perpetuity
in
them
you
do
not
say
as
at
the
north
that
a
fine
day
is
a
and
expect
a
week
of
storms
to
pay
for
it
day
after
day
passes
in
brightness
morning
after
morning
you
wake
to
see
the
same
sunshine
gilding
the
tops
of
the
and
hear
the
same
concert
of
birds
all
the
stand
in
perfected
glory
and
the
leaves
have
sprung
forth
with
such
rapidity
and
elastic
vigor
as
gives
the
foliage
a
wondrous
brightness
the
oaks
trees
which
for
some
reason
or
other
are
apt
to
be
spoken
of
as
of
small
account
have
now
put
forth
their
large
leaves
we
say
this
because
it
is
the
only
one
of
the
oak
species
here
that
at
all
resembles
the
oaks
we
have
been
accustomed
to
see
the
are
all
burst
out
in
white
fringes
of
blossom
and
the
silver
bells
of
the
are
now
in
their
perfection
under
foot
a
whole
tribe
of
new
flowers
have
come
in
place
of
the
departed
violets
the
or
of
the
north
grows
in
the
woods
in
dense
mats
and
is
now
white
with
its
little
starry
blossoms
certain
nameless
little
golden
balls
of
flowers
twinkle
in
the
grass
and
leaves
like
small
constellations
we
call
them
for
lack
of
botanic
language
our
party
the
other
night
made
an
expedition
to
the
second
branch
and
brought
home
long
vines
of
purple
wisteria
red
and
some
sprays
of
white
blossoms
unknown
to
us
so
that
our
house
still
is
a
spring
is
as
much
a
pomp
and
a
glory
here
as
in
northern
states
for
although
the
winter
is
far
more
endurable
and
preserves
far
more
beauty
yet
the
outburst
of
vividness
and
vigor
when
the
sun
begins
to
wax
powerful
is
even
greater
and
more
marked
than
at
the
north
the
roses
are
now
in
perfection
ours
have
not
thriven
as
they
might
have
done
were
it
not
for
the
but
still
they
give
us
every
morning
with
our
breakfast
a
comforting
assortment
la
marque
giant
of
battles
hermosa
a
little
cluster
rose
and
a
dozen
more
have
brightened
our
repast
this
is
the
land
to
raise
roses
however
and
we
mean
yet
to
have
a
at
a
safe
distance
from
any
and
see
what
will
come
of
it
here
are
no
slugs
or
or
caterpillars
to
make
a
burden
and
a
vexation
finally
as
we
have
had
so
many
letters
asking
information
of
us
we
wish
somebody
who
is
wise
enough
would
write
one
and
give
us
some
on
a
certain
point
one
of
our
has
become
an
invalid
the
case
may
be
stated
as
follows
early
in
the
season
in
looking
over
the
grove
found
this
tree
then
loaded
with
fruit
dropping
its
leaves
the
leaves
curling
or
as
they
say
here
rolling
as
is
the
fashion
of
when
suffering
from
drought
immediately
he
took
all
the
fruit
from
the
tree
pruned
it
dug
about
the
roots
and
examined
them
to
find
something
to
account
for
this
for
a
while
by
careful
tending
the
tree
seemed
to
be
coming
to
itself
but
when
the
came
round
half
its
leaves
fell
and
it
burst
into
blossoms
on
every
spray
and
twig
in
the
most
preternatural
manner
it
reminded
us
of
some
poor
dear
women
who
when
they
lose
their
health
seem
resolved
to
kill
themselves
in
abundant
good
works
it
was
really
blossoming
to
death
now
we
ask
any
wise
what
is
this
disease
and
how
is
it
to
be
treated
we
have
treated
it
by
cutting
off
all
the
blossoms
cutting
back
the
branches
watering
with
water
in
which
guano
and
lime
have
been
dissolved
and
the
patient
looks
a
little
better
a
negro
workman
testified
that
a
tree
in
a
similar
state
had
been
brought
back
by
these
means
can
any
give
any
light
on
this
subject
illustration
magnolia
week
april
it
is
vain
to
propose
and
announce
subjects
from
week
to
week
one
must
write
what
one
is
thinking
of
when
the
mind
is
full
of
one
thing
why
go
about
to
write
on
another
the
past
week
we
have
been
engrossed
by
magnolias
on
monday
our
friend
d
armed
and
equipped
with
ascended
the
glistening
battlements
of
the
great
forest
palaces
fronting
his
cottage
and
bore
thence
the
white
princesses
just
bursting
into
bud
and
brought
them
down
to
us
forthwith
all
else
was
given
up
for
who
would
take
the
portrait
of
the
white
lady
must
hurry
for
like
many
queens
of
earth
there
is
but
a
step
between
perfected
beauty
and
decay
a
moment
between
beauty
and
ashes
we
bore
them
to
our
chamber
and
before
morning
the
whole
room
was
filled
with
the
intoxicating
dreamy
fragrance
and
lo
while
we
slept
the
pearly
hinges
had
revolved
noiselessly
and
the
bud
that
we
left
the
evening
before
had
become
a
great
and
glorious
flower
to
descend
to
particulars
imagine
a
thick
peony
of
the
largest
size
just
revealing
in
its
centre
an
cone
of
the
size
of
a
walnut
around
it
like
a
circlet
of
emeralds
were
the
new
green
leaves
contrasting
in
their
vivid
freshness
with
the
solid
brilliancy
of
the
old
foliage
the
leaves
of
the
magnolia
are
in
themselves
beauty
enough
without
the
flower
we
used
to
gather
them
in
a
sort
of
rapture
before
we
ever
saw
the
blossom
but
all
we
can
say
of
the
flower
is
that
it
is
worthy
of
them
we
sat
down
before
this
queen
of
flowers
and
worked
assiduously
at
her
portrait
we
had
besides
the
full
blossom
one
bud
of
the
size
and
shape
of
a
large
egg
which
we
despaired
of
seeing
opened
but
proposed
to
paint
as
it
was
the
second
morning
our
green
egg
began
to
turn
forth
a
silver
lining
and
as
we
worked
we
could
see
it
slowly
opening
before
us
silvery
and
pearly
were
the
pure
tips
while
the
outside
was
of
a
creamy
yellow
melting
into
green
two
days
we
kept
faithful
watch
and
ward
at
the
shrine
but
lo
on
the
morning
of
the
third
our
beautiful
fairy
had
changed
in
the
night
to
an
ugly
brownie
the
petals
so
waxen
fair
the
night
before
had
become
of
a
mahogany
color
and
a
breeze
passing
by
swept
them
dishonored
in
showers
on
the
floor
the
history
of
that
magnolia
was
finished
we
had
seen
it
unfold
and
die
our
pearly
bud
however
went
on
waxing
and
opening
till
its
day
came
for
full
perfection
the
third
day
our
friend
again
brought
in
a
glorious
bouquet
no
ordinary
would
hold
it
it
required
a
heavy
stone
jar
and
a
gallon
of
water
but
we
filled
the
recess
of
our
franklin
stove
with
the
beauties
and
the
whole
house
was
scented
with
their
perfume
then
we
thought
of
the
great
lonely
swamps
and
everglades
where
thousands
of
these
beauties
are
now
bursting
into
flower
with
no
earthly
eye
to
behold
them
the
old
german
legends
of
female
spirits
inhabiting
trees
recurred
to
us
our
magnolia
would
make
a
beautiful
libussa
a
flower
is
commonly
thought
the
emblem
of
a
woman
and
a
woman
is
generally
thought
of
as
something
sweet
clinging
tender
and
perishable
but
there
are
women
flowers
that
correspond
to
the
forest
magnolia
high
and
strong
with
a
great
hold
of
root
and
a
great
spread
of
branches
and
whose
pulsations
of
heart
and
emotion
come
forth
like
these
silver
lilies
that
illuminate
the
green
shadows
of
the
yesterday
our
friend
the
rev
m
called
and
invited
us
to
go
with
him
to
visit
his
place
situated
at
the
mouth
of
julington
just
where
it
flows
into
the
john
our
obliging
neighbor
immediately
proposed
to
take
the
whole
party
in
his
an
impromptu
picnic
was
proclaimed
through
the
house
every
one
dropped
the
work
in
hand
and
flew
to
spreading
sandwiches
oranges
were
gathered
packed
and
the
train
filed
out
from
the
two
houses
the
breeze
was
fresh
and
fair
and
away
we
flew
here
on
the
john
a
is
more
to
the
purpose
in
the
present
state
of
our
than
any
and
the
delight
of
sailing
is
something
infinitely
above
any
other
locomotion
on
this
great
beautiful
river
you
go
drifting
like
a
feather
or
a
cloud
while
the
green
fragrant
shores
form
a
picture
as
you
pass
yesterday
as
we
were
sailing
we
met
a
little
green
floating
island
which
seemed
to
have
started
out
on
its
own
account
and
gone
to
seek
its
fortune
we
saw
it
at
first
in
the
distance
a
small
undulating
spot
of
vivid
green
our
little
craft
was
steered
right
alongside
so
that
we
could
minutely
observe
it
was
some
square
yards
of
bonnet
and
other
which
it
would
seem
had
concluded
to
colonize
and
go
out
to
see
the
world
in
company
we
watched
them
as
they
went
nodding
and
tilting
off
over
the
blue
waters
and
wondered
where
they
would
bring
up
but
now
we
are
at
the
mouth
of
julington
and
running
across
to
a
point
of
land
on
the
other
side
our
boat
comes
to
anchor
under
a
grove
of
which
lean
over
the
water
they
are
not
yet
fully
in
blossom
one
bud
and
one
flower
appear
on
a
low
branch
overhanging
the
river
and
are
marked
to
be
gathered
when
we
return
we
go
up
and
begin
strolling
along
the
shore
the
extends
along
the
edge
of
the
water
for
half
a
mile
very
few
flowers
are
yet
developed
but
the
trees
themselves
in
the
vivid
contrast
of
the
new
leaves
with
the
old
are
beauty
enough
out
of
the
centre
of
the
spike
of
last
year
solemn
green
comes
the
most
vivid
varnished
cluster
of
fresh
young
leaves
and
from
the
centre
of
this
brilliant
cluster
comes
the
the
magnolia
being
an
evergreen
obeys
in
its
mode
of
growth
the
law
which
governs
all
evergreens
when
the
new
shoots
come
out
the
fall
off
this
produces
in
the
magnolia
a
effect
of
color
as
we
looked
up
in
the
grove
each
spike
had
first
the
young
green
leaves
below
those
the
dark
heavy
ones
and
below
those
still
the
decaying
ones
preparing
to
fall
these
change
with
all
the
rich
colors
of
decaying
leaves
some
are
of
a
pure
brilliant
yellow
others
yellow
mottled
and
spotted
with
green
others
take
a
tawny
orange
and
again
a
faded
brown
the
afternoon
sun
shining
through
this
grove
gave
all
these
effects
of
color
in
full
brightness
the
trees
as
yet
had
but
here
and
there
a
blossom
each
shoot
had
its
bud
for
the
most
part
no
larger
than
a
walnut
the
most
advanced
were
of
the
size
of
an
egg
of
white
tinted
with
green
beneath
the
trees
the
ground
was
thickly
strewn
with
the
golden
brown
and
mottled
leaves
which
were
ever
and
anon
sailing
down
as
the
wind
swayed
them
numbers
of
little
seedling
magnolias
were
springing
up
everywhere
about
us
and
we
easily
pulled
up
from
the
loose
yielding
soil
quite
a
number
of
them
wrapping
their
roots
in
the
gray
moss
which
always
lies
at
hand
for
the
place
had
many
native
wild
which
had
been
cut
off
and
budded
with
the
sweet
orange
and
were
making
vigorous
growth
under
the
shade
of
the
high
m
had
set
out
young
orange
and
lemon
trees
through
quite
an
extent
of
the
forest
he
told
us
that
he
had
two
thousand
plants
thus
growing
it
is
becoming
a
favorite
idea
with
here
that
the
tropical
fruits
are
less
likely
to
be
injured
by
frosts
and
make
a
more
rapid
and
sure
growth
under
the
protecting
shadow
of
the
wild
orange
is
found
frequently
growing
in
this
way
and
they
take
counsel
of
nature
in
this
respect
after
wandering
a
while
in
the
wood
we
picnicked
under
a
spreading
with
the
breeze
from
the
river
drawing
gratefully
across
us
our
dinner
over
m
took
us
through
his
plantations
of
grapes
peaches
and
all
other
good
things
black
hamburg
grapes
grafted
upon
the
root
of
the
native
vine
had
made
luxuriant
growth
and
were
setting
full
of
grapes
there
were
shoots
of
this
year
growth
full
six
and
seven
feet
in
length
in
the
were
trees
covered
with
young
peaches
which
m
told
us
were
only
three
years
from
the
seed
all
the
garden
vegetables
were
there
in
fine
order
and
the
appeared
to
be
in
full
maturity
it
is
now
five
years
since
m
bought
and
began
to
clear
this
place
then
a
dense
forest
at
first
the
of
the
sun
on
the
decaying
vegetation
and
the
upturning
of
the
soil
made
the
place
unhealthy
and
it
was
found
necessary
to
remove
the
family
now
the
work
is
done
the
place
cleared
and
he
says
as
healthy
as
any
other
m
is
an
enthusiastic
horticulturist
and
florist
and
is
about
to
enrich
the
place
with
a
of
some
thousands
of
choice
varieties
these
places
in
florida
must
not
in
any
wise
be
compared
with
the
finished
ones
of
northern
states
they
are
spots
torn
out
of
the
very
heart
of
the
forest
and
where
nature
is
rebelling
daily
and
rushing
with
all
her
might
back
again
into
the
wild
freedom
from
which
she
has
been
a
moment
led
captive
but
a
day
is
coming
when
they
will
be
wonderfully
beautiful
and
productive
we
had
one
adventure
in
conquering
and
killing
a
about
seven
feet
in
length
he
had
no
fangs
and
m
told
us
belonged
to
a
perfectly
respectable
and
harmless
family
whose
only
vice
is
they
are
called
in
consequence
of
the
partiality
they
show
for
young
chickens
which
they
swallow
feathers
and
all
with
good
digestion
and
relish
he
informed
us
that
they
were
vigorous
ratters
and
better
than
either
terrier
or
cat
for
keeping
barns
clear
of
rats
and
that
for
this
purpose
they
were
often
cherished
in
granaries
as
they
will
follow
the
rats
to
retreats
where
cats
can
not
go
imagine
the
feelings
of
a
rat
when
this
dreadful
visitor
comes
like
grim
death
into
his
in
regard
to
snakes
in
general
the
chance
of
meeting
hurtful
ones
in
florida
is
much
less
than
in
many
other
states
m
who
in
the
way
of
his
mission
has
ridden
all
through
florida
never
yet
met
a
rattlesnake
or
was
endangered
by
any
venomous
serpent
perhaps
the
yearly
burnings
of
the
grass
which
have
been
practised
so
long
in
florida
have
had
some
effect
in
checking
the
increase
of
serpents
by
destroying
their
eggs
as
the
afternoon
sun
waxed
low
we
sought
our
yacht
again
and
came
back
with
two
and
several
buds
this
week
too
the
woods
are
full
of
the
blossoms
of
the
our
neighbor
c
has
bought
the
beautiful
where
he
is
preparing
to
build
a
house
walking
over
to
see
the
spot
the
other
evening
we
found
a
jungle
of
netted
around
on
the
ground
and
clinging
to
bush
and
tree
another
neighbor
also
brought
us
in
some
branches
of
a
called
the
indian
pipe
which
eclipses
the
sparkleberry
like
that
it
seems
to
be
a
glorified
variety
of
high
huckleberry
or
blueberry
it
has
the
greatest
profusion
of
waxen
white
bells
fringing
every
twig
and
as
we
have
been
with
floral
displays
we
had
a
new
sensation
when
it
was
brought
into
the
house
thus
goes
the
floral
procession
in
april
in
the
in
the
gardens
the
oleanders
pink
white
and
deep
crimson
are
beginning
their
long
season
of
bloom
the
scarlet
pomegranate
with
its
vivid
sparks
of
color
shines
through
the
leaves
we
are
sorry
for
all
those
who
write
to
beg
that
we
will
send
by
mail
a
specimen
of
this
or
that
flower
our
experience
has
shown
us
that
in
that
way
they
are
transferable
would
arrive
dark
and
dreadful
and
it
is
far
better
to
view
the
flowers
ever
fresh
and
blooming
through
imagination
than
to
receive
a
desolate
faded
crumpled
remnant
by
mail
illustration
buying
land
in
florida
may
we
have
before
us
a
neat
little
pile
of
what
we
call
palmetto
letters
responses
to
our
papers
from
all
states
in
the
union
our
knowledge
of
geography
has
really
been
quite
brightened
by
the
effort
to
find
out
where
all
our
correspondents
are
living
nothing
could
more
mark
the
exceptional
severity
of
the
recent
winter
than
the
bursts
of
enthusiasm
with
which
the
tidings
of
flowers
and
freedom
in
florida
have
come
to
those
struggling
through
and
in
the
more
ungenial
parts
of
our
union
florida
seems
to
have
risen
before
their
vision
as
the
hymn
sings
of
better
shores
on
jordan
stormy
banks
i
stand
and
cast
a
wistful
eye
to
canaan
fair
and
happy
land
consequently
the
letters
of
inquiry
have
come
in
showers
what
is
the
price
of
land
where
shall
we
go
how
shall
we
get
there
we
have
before
advertised
you
o
beloved
unknown
who
write
that
your
letters
are
welcome
ofttimes
cheering
amusing
and
undeniably
nice
letters
yet
we
can
not
pledge
ourselves
to
answer
except
in
the
gross
and
through
the
christian
union
the
last
inquiry
is
from
three
brothers
who
want
to
settle
and
have
homes
together
at
the
south
they
ask
is
there
government
land
that
can
be
had
in
florida
yes
there
is
a
plenty
of
it
yet
as
florida
is
the
oldest
settled
state
in
the
union
and
has
always
been
a
sort
of
bone
for
which
adventurers
have
wrangled
the
best
land
in
it
has
been
probably
taken
up
we
do
not
profess
to
be
and
we
speak
only
for
the
tract
of
land
lying
on
the
john
river
between
mandarin
and
jacksonville
when
we
say
that
there
are
thousands
of
acres
of
good
land
near
to
a
market
near
to
a
great
river
on
which
three
or
four
steamboats
are
daily
plying
that
can
be
had
for
five
dollars
per
acre
and
for
even
less
than
that
fine
handsome
in
the
neighborhood
of
jacksonville
are
rising
in
value
commanding
much
higher
prices
than
the
mere
productive
value
of
the
land
in
other
words
men
pay
for
advantages
for
society
for
facilities
afforded
by
settlements
now
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
are
seriously
thinking
of
coming
to
florida
we
have
taken
some
pains
to
get
the
practical
experience
of
men
who
are
now
working
the
land
as
to
what
it
will
do
on
the
of
may
we
accepted
the
invitation
of
hardee
to
visit
his
pioneer
nursery
now
in
the
fourth
year
of
its
existence
hardee
is
an
enthusiast
in
his
business
and
it
is
a
department
where
we
are
delighted
to
see
enthusiasm
the
close
of
the
war
found
him
as
he
said
miserably
poor
but
brave
and
undiscouraged
he
retained
his
former
slaves
as
free
laborers
took
a
tract
of
land
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
jacksonville
put
up
a
house
cleared
planted
ploughed
and
digged
and
in
the
course
of
four
years
results
are
beginning
to
tell
handsomely
as
they
always
do
for
energy
and
industry
he
showed
us
through
his
grounds
where
every
thing
was
growing
at
the
rate
things
do
grow
here
in
the
month
of
may
two
things
hardee
seems
to
have
demonstrated
first
that
may
be
a
success
in
florida
and
second
that
certain
varieties
of
northern
apples
and
pears
may
be
raised
here
we
arrived
in
florida
in
the
middle
of
january
and
one
of
the
party
who
spent
a
night
at
the
james
was
surprised
by
seeing
a
peck
of
fresh
ripe
strawberries
brought
in
they
were
from
hardee
nursery
and
grown
in
the
open
air
and
he
informed
us
that
they
had
during
all
the
winter
a
daily
supply
of
the
fruit
sufficient
for
a
large
family
and
a
considerable
overplus
for
the
market
the
month
of
may
however
is
the
height
of
the
season
and
they
were
picking
they
informed
us
at
the
rate
of
eighty
quarts
per
day
in
regard
to
apples
and
pears
hardee
method
is
to
graft
them
upon
the
native
hawthorn
and
the
results
are
really
quite
wonderful
hardee
was
so
complaisant
as
to
cut
and
present
to
us
a
handsome
cluster
of
red
astrachan
apples
about
the
size
of
large
hickory
nuts
the
result
of
the
second
year
from
the
graft
several
varieties
of
pears
had
made
a
truly
astonishing
growth
and
promise
to
fruit
in
time
abundantly
a
large
presented
a
show
of
peaches
some
of
the
size
of
a
butternut
and
some
of
a
walnut
concerning
one
which
he
called
the
japan
peach
he
had
sanguine
hope
of
ripe
fruit
in
ten
days
we
were
not
absolute
in
the
faith
as
to
the
exact
date
but
believe
that
there
will
undoubtedly
be
ripe
peaches
there
before
the
month
of
may
is
out
hardee
is
particularly
in
favor
of
cultivating
fruit
in
ground
most
of
these
growths
we
speak
of
were
under
the
shade
of
large
but
when
he
took
us
into
the
wild
forest
and
showed
us
peach
orange
and
lemon
trees
set
to
struggle
for
existence
on
the
same
footing
and
with
only
the
same
advantages
as
the
wild
denizens
of
the
forest
we
rather
demurred
was
not
this
pushing
theory
to
extremes
time
will
show
hardee
has
two
or
three
native
seedling
peaches
grown
in
florida
of
which
he
speaks
highly
thompson
golden
free
which
commences
ripening
in
june
and
continues
till
the
first
of
august
the
cracker
cart
very
large
weighing
sometimes
thirteen
ounces
the
cling
yellow
and
the
japan
very
small
and
sweet
ripening
in
may
besides
these
hardee
has
experimented
largely
in
vines
in
which
he
gives
preference
to
the
isabella
hartford
prolific
and
concord
he
is
also
giving
attention
to
roses
and
ornamental
shrubbery
what
makes
the
inception
of
such
nurseries
as
hardee
a
matter
of
congratulation
is
that
they
furnish
to
purchasers
things
that
have
been
proved
suited
to
the
climate
and
soil
of
florida
roses
and
grapes
sent
from
the
north
bring
here
the
habit
of
their
northern
growth
which
often
makes
them
worthless
with
a
singular
stubbornness
they
adhere
to
the
times
and
seasons
to
which
they
have
been
accustomed
farther
north
we
set
a
of
some
four
hundred
trees
which
we
obtained
from
a
nursery
in
georgia
we
suspect
now
that
having
a
press
of
orders
our
nurseryman
simply
sent
us
a
packet
of
trees
from
some
northern
nursery
the
consequence
is
that
year
after
year
when
all
nature
about
them
is
bursting
into
leaf
and
blossom
when
peaches
of
good
size
gem
the
boughs
of
florida
trees
our
stands
sullen
and
leafless
nor
will
it
start
bud
or
blossom
till
the
time
for
peaches
to
start
in
new
york
the
same
has
been
our
trouble
with
some
fine
varieties
of
roses
which
we
took
from
our
northern
grounds
as
yet
they
are
hardly
worth
the
ground
they
occupy
and
whether
they
ever
will
do
any
thing
is
a
matter
of
doubt
meanwhile
we
have
only
to
ride
a
little
way
into
the
to
see
around
many
a
rustic
cabin
a
perfect
blaze
of
crimson
roses
and
cluster
roses
foaming
over
the
fences
in
cascades
of
flowers
these
are
florida
roses
born
and
bred
and
this
is
the
way
they
do
with
not
one
tithe
of
the
work
and
care
that
we
have
expended
on
our
poor
northern
exiles
hardee
therefore
in
attempting
the
pioneer
nursery
of
florida
is
doing
a
good
thing
for
every
and
we
wish
him
all
success
as
a
parting
present
we
received
a
fine
summer
squash
which
for
the
first
of
may
one
must
admit
is
good
growth
and
now
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
may
want
to
take
up
land
in
florida
we
shall
give
the
experience
of
some
friends
and
neighbors
of
ours
who
have
carried
through
about
as
thorough
and
an
experiment
as
any
and
we
give
it
from
memoranda
which
they
have
kindly
furnished
in
the
hope
of
being
of
use
to
other
settlers
illustration
our
experience
in
crops
a
few
years
ago
three
brothers
farmers
from
vermont
exhausted
by
the
long
hard
winters
there
came
to
florida
to
try
an
experiment
they
bought
two
hundred
and
acres
in
the
vicinity
of
mandarin
at
one
dollar
per
acre
it
was
that
had
been
cut
over
twice
for
timber
and
was
now
considered
of
no
further
value
by
its
possessor
who
threw
it
into
the
hands
of
a
to
make
what
he
could
of
it
it
was
the
very
cheapest
kind
of
florida
land
of
this
land
they
cleared
only
acres
the
fencing
cost
two
hundred
dollars
they
put
up
a
large
unplastered
house
with
piazzas
to
both
floors
at
a
cost
of
about
a
thousand
dollars
the
additional
outlay
was
on
two
mules
and
a
pair
of
oxen
estimated
at
four
hundred
dollars
the
last
year
they
put
up
a
and
establishment
at
a
cost
of
five
hundred
dollars
an
a
vineyard
and
a
are
all
included
in
the
programme
of
these
operators
and
are
all
well
under
way
but
these
are
later
results
it
is
not
safe
to
calculate
on
an
under
ten
years
or
on
a
vineyard
or
under
four
or
five
we
have
permission
to

a

none

but
those

did
so
well
as
to
put
us
in
good
humor
with

and
induce
us
to
plant
for
this

every

pretty
good

twenty

irish

we
have
found
these
on
light
soil
with
only
moderate
fertilizing
an
unprofitable
crop
at

but
on

land
with
very
heavy

decidedly
profitable
at

than

may
be
extraordinarily
profitable

pretty
sure
we
have
not
done
much
with
peas
but
a
neighbor
of
ours
prefers
them
to
cabbages
he
gets
about
three
dollars
per
bushel
as
a
general
summary
our
friend
adds
for
two
years
in
succession
we
have
found
our
leading
handsomely
remunerative
the
net
returns
look
well
compared
with
those
of
successful
gardening
near
new
york
cabbages
raised
here
during
the
fall
and
winter
without
any
protection
bear
as
good
price
as
do
the
spring
cabbages
which
are
raised
in
at
the
north
and
early
cucumbers
grown
in
the
open
air
have
been
worth
as
much
to
us
as
to
northern
gardeners
who
have
grown
them
in
the
secret
of
our
success
is
an
open
one
but
we
ourselves
do
not
yet
come
up
to
our
mark
and
reduce
our
preaching
to
practice
we
have
hardly
made
a
good
beginning
in
high
manuring
we
did
not
understand
at
first
as
we
now
do
the
difference
between
ordinary
crops
and
vegetables
and
fruits
good
corn
may
be
raised
on
poor
land
at
the
rate
of
five
or
ten
bushels
to
the
acre
but
on
a
hundred
acres
of
land
scarcely
a
single
handsome
cabbage
can
be
grown
so
with
cucumbers
they
will
neither
be
early
nor
fit
for
market
if
raised
on
ordinary
land
with
ordinary
culture
most
of
the
in
florida
so
far
as
we
know
it
can
not
but
prove
disastrous
and
visionaries
hold
forth
that
great
crops
may
be
expected
from
insignificant
outlays
and
so
they
decoy
the
credulous
to
their
ruin
to
undertake
raising
vegetables
in
florida
with
these
ideas
of
low
culture
is
to
embark
in
a
leaky
and
ship
if
one
is
unwilling
to
expend
for
manure
alone
upon
a
single
acre
in
one
year
enough
to
buy
a
hundred
acres
of
new
land
let
him
give
a
wide
berth
to
such
expenditures
have
to
be
met
at
the
north
and
there
is
no
getting
round
it
at
the
south
yet
one
can
economize
here
as
one
can
not
at
the
north
the
whole
culture
of
an
early
can
go
on
in
connection
with
the
later
crop
of
before
our
cabbages
were
off
the
ground
this
spring
we
had
our
between
them
and
we
never
before
prepared
the
ground
and
planted
the
cane
so
easily
on
another
field
we
have
the
eight
feet
apart
and
tomatoes
and
intervening
we
have
suffered
much
for
lack
of
proper
drainage
we
have
actually
lost
enough
from
water
standing
upon
crops
to
have
underdrained
the
whole
enclosure
we
undertook
to
till
more
acres
than
we
could
do
justice
to
in
farming
the
of
is
the
root
of
all
evil
so
much
for
our
friend
experiences
we
consider
this
experiment
a
most
valuable
one
for
all
who
contemplate
buying
land
and
settling
in
florida
it
is
an
experiment
in
which
untiring
industry
patience
and
economy
have
been
brought
into
exercise
it
has
been
tried
on
the
very
cheapest
land
in
florida
and
its
results
are
most
instructive
must
be
the
immediate
source
of
support
and
therefore
this
experiment
is
exactly
in
point
this
will
show
that
the
land
is
the
least
of
the
expense
in
starting
a
farm
and
that
it
is
best
in
the
first
instance
to
spend
little
for
land
and
much
for
the
culture
of
it
thousands
of
people
pour
down
into
florida
to
winter
and
must
be
fed
the
jacksonville
market
and
the
markets
of
all
the
different
boarding
establishments
on
the
river
need
ample
supplies
and
there
is
no
fear
that
there
will
not
be
a
ready
sale
for
all
that
could
be
raised
our
friends
are
willing
to
make
a
free
contribution
of
their
own
failures
and
mistakes
for
the
good
of
those
who
come
after
it
shows
that
a
new
country
must
be
and
tried
before
success
is
attained
by
settling
in
the
vicinity
of
successful
planters

shorten
the
painful
paths
of
experience

which

to
shoot
up
as
by
magic
hearing
filling
the

from

we
feel
a
sort
of
tropical
exultation
as
if
great
succulent
shoots
of
passion
or
poetry
might
spring
up
within
us
from

were
a

little
vibrating
bells
they
iterate
and
reiterate
one
sweet

answer
from

they
chatter
and
mock
at
each
other
with
airy
defiance
and
sometimes
it
seems
as
if
the
very
air
broke
into
rollicking
a
naturalist
who
like
thoreau
has
sojourned
for
months
in
the
florida
forests
to
study
and
observe
nature
has
told
us
that
no

be
got
till
the
hot

then
the

him
our
own
phoebus

his
cage
is
hung
on
the
shady
side
of
the
veranda
hangs
sulky
and
silent
but
put
him
in
the
full
blaze
of
the
sun
and
while
the
thermometer
is
going
up
to
the
nineties
he
rackets
in
a
perfectly
crazy
abandon
of
bird
babblement
singing
all
he
ever
heard
before
and
trying
his
bill
at
new
notes
and
as
a
climax
ending
each
outburst
with
a
purr
of
satisfaction
like
an
overgrown
cat
several
pairs
of
family
have
their
nests
somewhere
in
our
and
there
is
no
end
of
amusement
in
watching
their
dainty
evolutions
sometimes
for
an
hour
at
a
time
one
of
them
perched
high
and
dry
on
a
topmost
twig
where
he
gets
the
full
blaze
of
the
sun
will
make
the
air
ring
with
so
many
notes
and
noises
that
it
would
seem
as
if
he
were
forty
birds
instead
of
one
then
again
you
will
see
him
stealing
silently
about
as
if
on
some
mysterious
mission
perching
here
and
there
with
a
peculiar
nervous
jerk
of
his
long
tail
and
a
silent
little
lift
of
his
wings
as
if
he
were
fanning
himself
what
this
motion
is
for
we
have
never
been
able
to
determine
our
plantation
at
present
is
entirely
given
over
to
the
domestic
affairs
of
the
dozens
of
whom
have
built
their
nests
in
the
green
inaccessible
fastnesses
of
the
and
been
rearing
families
in
security
now
however
the
young
birds
are
to
be
taught
to
fly
and
the
air
resounds
with
the
bustle
and
chatter
of
the
operation
take
for
example
one
scene
which
is
going
on
as
we
write
down
on
the
little
wharf
which
passes
through
the
swamp
in
front
of
our
house
three
or
four
juvenile
are
running
up
and
down
like
chickens
uttering
plaintive
cries
of
distress
on
either
side
perched
on
a
tall
dry
sit
papa
and
mamma
chattering
scolding
exhorting
and
coaxing
the
little
ones

from
side
to
side
and
say
in
plaintive
squeaks
i
ca
i
dare
as
plain
as
birds
can
say
it
there
now
they
spread
their
little
wings
and
oh
joy
they
find
to
their
delight
that
they
do
not
fall
they
exult
in
the
possession
of
a
sense
of
existence
as
we
look
at
this
pantomime
graver
thoughts
come
over
us
and
we
think
how
poor
timid
little
souls
moan
and
hang
back
and
tremble
when
the
time
comes
to
leave
this
nest
of
earth
and
trust
themselves
to
the
free
air
of
the
world
they
were
made
for
as
the
little
bird
moans
and
cries
end
in
delight
and
rapture
in
finding
himself
in
a
new
glorious
free
life
so
just
beyond
the
dark
step
of
death
will
come
a
buoyant
exulting
sense
of
new
existence
our
life
here
is
in
intimate
communion
with
their
singing
all
day
comes
in
bursts
and
snatches
and
one
awakes
to
a
sort
of
wondering
consciousness
of
the
many
airy
dialects
with
which
the
blue
heavens
are
filled
at
night
a
whippoorwill
or
two
perched
in
the
make

plaintive
and
familiar
music
when
the
nights
are
hot
and
the
moon
bright
the
burst
into
gushes
of
song
at
any
hour
at
midnight
we
have
risen
to
listen
to
them
birds
are
as
plenty
about
us
as
chickens
in
a
barnyard
and
one
wonders
at
their
incessant
activity
and
motion
and
studies
what
their
quaint
little
fanciful
ways
may
mean
half
inclined
to
say
with
cowper
but
i
whatever
powers
were
mine
would
cheerfully
those
gifts
resign
for
such
a
pair
of
wings
as
thine
and
such
a
head
between
speaking
of
birds
reminds
us
of
a
little
pastoral
which
is
being
enacted
in
the
neighborhood
of
augustine
a
young
man
from
massachusetts
driven
to
seek
health
in
a
milder
climate
has
bought
a
spot
of
land
for
a
in
the
neighborhood
of
augustine
we
visited
his
place
and
found
him
and
his
mother
in
a
neat
little
cottage
adorned
only
with
grasses
and
flowers
picked
in
the
wild
woods
and
living
in
perfect
familiarity
with
the
birds
which
they
have
learned
to
call
in
from
the
neighboring
forests
it
has
become
one
of
the
fashionable
amusements
in
the
season
for
strangers
to
drive
out
to
this
cottage
and
see
the
birds
fed
at
a
cry
from
the
inmates
of
the
cottage
the
and
will
come
in
flocks
settle
on
their
shoulders
eat
out
of
their
hands
or
out
of
the
hands
of
any
one
who
chooses
to
hold
food
to
them
when
we
drove
out
however
the
birds
were
mostly
dispersed
about
their
domestic
affairs
this
being
the
nesting
season
moreover
the
ample
supply
of
fresh
wild
berries
in
the
woods
makes
them
less
anxious
for
such
dry
food
as
contented
them
in
winter
only
one
pet
had
established
himself
in
a
neighboring
tree
and
came
at
their
call
pic
sat
aloft
switching
his
long
tail
with
a
jerky
air
of
indifference
like
an
when
raisins
were
thrown
up
he
caught
them
once
or
twice
but
at
last
with
an
evident
declared
that
it
was
no
go
and
he
did
care
for
raisins
ungrateful
pic
next
winter
eager
and
hungry
he
will
be
grateful
and
so
with
all
the
rest
of
them
one
of
the
charms
of
may
not
to
be
forgotten
is
the
blossoming
of
the
great
cape
jessamine
that
stands
at
the
end
of
the
veranda
which
has
certainly
had
as
many
as
three
or
four
hundred
great
white
fragrant
flowers
at
once
as
near
as
possible
this
is
the
most
perfect
of
flowers
it
is
as
pure
as
the
white
camellia
with
the
added
gift
of
exquisite
perfume
it
is
a
camellia
with
a
soul
its
leaves
are
of
most
brilliant
varnished
green
its
buds
are
lovely
and
its
expanded
flower
is
of
a
thick
waxen
texture
and
as
large
as
a
large
camellia
we
have
sat
moonlight
nights
at
the
end
of
the
veranda
and
enjoyed
it
it
wraps
one
in
an
atmosphere
of
perfume
only
one
fault
has
this
bush
it
blossoms
only
once
a
season
not
like
the
oleander
for
months
one
feels
a
sense
of
hurry
to
enjoy
and
appropriate
a
bloom
so
rare
that
lasts
only
a
few
weeks
here
in
florida
flowers
form
a
large
item
of
thought
and
conversation
wherever
one
goes
and
the
reason
of
it
is
the
transcendent
beauty
and
variety
that
are
here
presented
we
have
just
returned
from
augustine
and
seen
some
gardens
where
wealth
and
leisure
have
expended
themselves
on
flowers
and
in
our
next
chapter
we
will
tell
of
some
of
these
beauties

with
us
during
the
third

rose
to

and
as
we
had
received
an
invitation
from
a
friend
to
visit
augustine
which
is
the
newport
of
florida
we
thought
it
a
good
time
to
go
seaward
so
on
a
pleasant
morning
we
embarked
on
the
handsome
boat
florence
which
has
taken
so
many
up
the
river
and
thus
secured
all
the
breeze
that
was
to
be
had
the
florence
is
used
expressly
for
a
river
plying
every
day
between
jacksonville
and
pilatka
it
is
long
and
airy
and
nicely
furnished
and
one
could
not
imagine
a
more
delightful
conveyance
in
hot
weather
one
could
not
be
more
sure
of
cool
breezes
than
when
sailing
up
and
down
perpetually
in
the
florence

destiny
however
landed
us
in
the
very
meridian

day

of
a
shed
and
a
and
a
little
shanty
where
to
those
who
require
refreshments
are
served
on
landing
we
found
that
we
must
pay
for
the
pleasure
and
coolness
of
coming
up
river
in
the
florence
by
waiting
two
or
three
mortal
hours
till
the
starlight
arrived
for
the
would
not
start
till
the
full
complement
of
passengers
was
secured
we
had
a
good
opportunity
then
of
testing
what
the
heat
of
a
florida
sun
might
be
untempered
by
and
orange
shades
and
unalleviated
by
and
the
lesson
was
an
impressive
one
the
railroad
across
to
augustine
is
made
of
wooden
rails
and
the
cars
are
drawn
by
horses
there
was
one
handsome
car
like
those
used
on
the
the
others
were
the
roughest
things
imaginable
travellers
have
usually
spoken
of
this
road
with
execration
for
its
slowness
and
roughness
but
over
this
such
as
it
was
all
the
rank
and
fashion
of
our
the
last
winter
have
been
pouring
in
unbroken
daily
streams
in
the
height
of
the
season
when
the
cars
were
crowded
four
hours
were
said
to
be
consumed
in
performing
this
fifteen
miles
we
however
did
it
in
about
two
to
us
this
bit
of
ride
through
the
florida
woods
is
such
a
source
of
interest
and
pleasure
that
we
do
not
mind
the
slowness
of
it
and
should
regret
being
whisked
by
at
we
have
come
over
it
three
times
and
each
time
the
varieties
of
shrubs
and
flowers
grasses
and
curious
leaves
were
a
study
and
delight
long
reaches
of
green
moist
land
form
perfect
whose
variety
of
bloom
changes
with
every
month
the
woods
hang
full
of
beautiful
climbing
plants
the
coral
honeysuckle
and
the
red
bignonia
were
in
season
now
through
glimpses
and
openings
here
and
there
we
could
see
into
forests
of
wild
and
raised
their
scaly
trunks
and
gigantic
green
fans
the
passengers
could
not
help
admiring
the
flowers
and
as
there
were
many
stops
and
pauses
and
as
the
gait
of
the
horses
was
never
rapid
it
was
quite
easy
for
the
gentlemen
to
gather
and
bring
in
specimens
of
all
the
beauties
and
the
flowers
formed
the
main
staple
of
the
conversation
they
were
so
very
bright
and
gay
and
varied
that
even
the
most
unobserving
could
not
but
notice
them
augustine
stands
on
a
flat
sandy
level
encompassed
for
miles
and
miles
by
what
is
called
scrub
a
mixture
of
low
palmettoes
and
bushes
of
various
descriptions
its
history
carries
one
back
almost
to
the
middle
ages
for
instance
menendez
who
figured
as
commandant
in
its
early
day
was
afterwards
appointed
to
command
the
spanish
armada
away
back
in
the
times
of
queen
elizabeth
but
owing
to
the
state
of
his
health
he
did
not
accept
the
position
in
the
year
elizabeth
then
being
at
war
with
spain
her
admiral
sir
francis
drake
bombarded
augustine
and
took
it
helping
himself
among
other
things
to
seven
brass
cannon
two
thousand
pounds
in
money
and
other
booty
in
it
was
taken
and
plundered
by
buccaneers
in
besieged
by
the
people
of
the
carolinas
in
besieged
again
by
oglethorpe
of
georgia
so
we
see
that
this
part
of
our
country
at
least
does
not
lie
open
to
the
imputation
so
often
cast
upon
america
of
having
no
historic
associations
though
like
a
great
deal
of
the
world
history
it
is
written
in
letters
of
blood
and
fire
whoever
would
know
let
him
read
parkman
pioneers
of
france
under
the
article
huguenots
in
florida
and
he
will
see
how
the
first
spanish
governor
menendez
thought
he
did
god
service
when
he
butchered
in
cold
blood
hundreds
of
starving
shipwrecked
huguenots
who
threw
themselves
on
his
mercy
and
to
whom
he
had
extended
pledges
of
shelter
and
protection
a
whose
ship
is
stationed
in
matanzas
inlet
told
me
that
the
tradition
is
that
the
place
is
still
haunted
by
the
unquiet
ghosts
of
the
dead
an
old
negro
came
to
him
earnestly
declaring
that
he
had
heard
often
at
midnight
shrieks
and
moans
and
sounds
as
of
expostulation
and
earnest
cries
in
some
foreign
language
at
that
place
and
that
several
white
people
whom
he
had
taken
to
the
spot
had
heard
the
same
on
inquiring
of
his
men
capt
h
could
find
none
who
had
heard
the
noises
although
in
digging
in
the
sands
human
bones
were
often
disinterred
but
surely
by
all
laws
of
demonology
here
is
where
there
ought
to
be
the
materials
for
a
here
where
there
has
been
such
crime
cruelty
treachery
terror
fear
and
agony
we
might
fancy
mourning
shades
wandering
in
unrest
shades
of
the
murderers
forever
deploring
their
crime
and
cruelty
the
aspect
of
augustine
is
quaint
and
strange
in
harmony
with
its
romantic
history
it
has
no
pretensions
to
architectural
richness
or
beauty
and
yet
it
is
impressive
from
its
unlikeness
to
any
thing
else
in
america
it
is
as
if
some
little
old
spanish
town
with
its
fort
and
gateway
and
moorish
had
broken
loose
floated
over
here
and
got
stranded
on
a
here
you
see
the
and
black
gowns
of
priests
the
convent
with
gliding
figures
of
nuns
and
in
the
narrow
crooked
streets
meet
people
with
great
spanish
eyes
and
hair
the
current
of
life
here
has
the
indolent
dreamy
stillness
that
characterizes
life
in
old
spain
in
spain
when
you
ask
a
man
to
do
any
thing
instead
of
answering
as
we
do
in
a
minute
the
invariable
reply
is
in
an
hour
and
the
growth
and
progress
of
augustine
have
been
according
there
it
stands
alone
isolated
connected
by
no
good
roads
or
navigation
with
the
busy
living
world
before
augustine
was
a
bower
of
almost
every
house
looked
forth
from
these
encircling
shades
the
frost
came
and
withered
all
and
in
very
few
cases
did
it
seem
to
come
into
the
heads
of
the
inhabitants
to
try
again
the
are
now
the
exception
not
the
rule
and
yet
for
thirty
years
it
has
been
quite
possible
to
have
them
as
the
only
seaport
city
of
any
size
in
florida
augustine
has
many
attractions
those
who
must
choose
a
southern
home
and
who
are
so
situated
that
they
must
remain
through
the
whole
summer
in
the
home
of
their
choice
could
not
do
better
than
to
choose
augustine
it
is
comparatively
free
from
malarial
fevers
and
the
tempers
the
oppressive
heats
of
summer
so
that
they
are
quite
endurable
can
be
practised
in
suitable
but
the
sharks
make
open
dangerous
if
one
comes
expecting
a
fine
view
of
the
open
ocean
however
one
will
be
disappointed
for
anastasia
island
a
long
low
stretches
its
barren
line
across
the
whole
view
giving
only
so
much
as
can
be
afforded
by
the
arm
of
the
sea
about
two
miles
wide
which
washes
the
town
little
as
this
may
seem
of
the
ocean
the
town
lies
so
flat
and
low
that
in
stormy
weather
the
waves
used
to
be
driven
up
into
it
so
as
to
threaten
its
destruction
a
of
solid
granite
masonry
was
deemed
necessary
to
secure
its
safety
and
has
been
erected
by
the
government
this
wall
affords
a
favorite
promenade
to
the
inhabitants
who
there
enjoy
good
footing
and
what
much
interested
us
in
augustine
was
to
see
the
results
of
such
wealth
and
care
as
are
expended
at
the
north
on
gardening
being
brought
to
bear
upon
gardens
in
this
region
as
yet
all
that
we
have
seen
in
florida
has
been
the
beginning
of
industrial
experiments
where
utility
has
been
the
only
thing
consulted
and
where
there
has
been
neither
time
nor
money
to
seek
the
ornamental
along
the
you
can
see
hundreds
of
places
torn
from
the
forest
yet
showing
the
unrotted
stumps
of
the
trees
the
house
standing
in
a
glare
of
loose
white
sand
in
which
one
sinks
over
shoes
at
every
step
if
there
be
a
and
wherever
there
is
a
woman
there
will
be
its
prospects
in
the
loose
sliding
sands
appear
discouraging
boards
and
are
necessary
to
make
any
kind
of
boundaries
and
a
man
who
has
to
cut
down
a
forest
dig
a
well
build
a
house
plant
an
and
meanwhile
raise
enough
to
pay
his
way
has
small
time
for
the
graces
but
here
in
augustine
are
some
families
of
wealth
and
leisure
driven
to
seek
such
a
who
amuse
themselves
during
their
stay
in
making
that
home
charming
and
the
results
are
encouraging
in
the
first
place
the
slippery
has
been
caught
and
confined
under
green
the
grass
problem
has
been
an
earnest
study
with
us
ever
since
we
came
here
what
grass
will
bear
a
steady
blaze
of
the
sun
for
six
months
with
the
thermometer
at
a
hundred
and
thirty
or
forty
is
a
question
it
is
perfectly
easy
as
we
have
proved
by
experiment
to
raise
flattering
of
white
clover
and
even
of
the
during
the
cool
charming
months
of
january
february
and
march
but
their
history
will
be
summed
up
in
the
scriptural
account
which
to
day
is
and
is
cast
into
the
oven
as
soon
as
may
begins
the
chances
of
an
enduring
sod
for
ornamental
purposes
are
confined
to
two
varieties
the
broad
and
the
narrow
leafed
bermuda
grasses
these
have
roots
that
run
either
to
the
centre
of
the
earth
or
far
enough
in
that
direction
for
practical
purposes
and
are
besides
endowed
with
the
faculty
of
throwing
out
roots
at
every
joint
so
that
they
spread
rapidly
the
kind
is
what
is
principally
employed
in
augustine
and
we
have
seen
gardens
where
it
is
cut
into
borders
and
where
the
and
have
been
made
of
it
to
admirable
advantage
a
surface
of
green
in
this
climate
is
doubly
precious
to
the
eye
we
were
visiting
in
a
house
which
is
a
model
for
a
hot
climate
a
wide
cool
hall
runs
through
the
centre
and
wide
verandas
both
above
and
below
go
around
the
whole
four
sides
from
these
we
could
look
down
at
our
leisure
into
the
foliage
of
a
row
of
magnolia
grandiflora
now
in
blossom
ivy
honeysuckles
manrundia
and
a
host
of
other
make
a
bower
of
these
outside
corridors
of
the
house
the
blossom
almost
daily
in
shaded
spots
and
beds
of
fragrant
blue
violets
are
never
without
flowers
among
the
ornamental
shrubbery
we
noticed
the
chaparral
a
thorny
tree
with
clusters
of
yellow
blossoms
and
long
drooping
peculiar
leaves
resembling
in
effect
the
acacia
the
banana
has
a
value
simply
as
an
plant
quite
apart
from
the
consideration
of
its
fruit
which
one
can
buy
perhaps
better
than
one
can
raise
in
this
part
of
florida
but
it
is
glorious
when
the
thermometer
is
going
up
into
the
hundreds
to
see
the
great
fresh
broad
cool
leaves
of
the
leaping
into
life
and
seeming
to
joy
in
existence
in
groups
of
different
sizes
they
form
most
beautiful
and
effective
shrubbery
the
secret
of
gardening
well
here
is
to
get
things
that
love
the
sun
plants
that
come
originally
from
hot
regions
and
that
rejoice
the
hotter
it
grows
are
those
to
be
sought
for
the
has
many
beautiful
specimens
in
the
gardens
of
augustine
a
at
near
view
is
as
quaint
and
peculiar
a
specimen
of
nature
as
one
can
imagine
its
trunk
seems
built
up
of
great
scales
in
which
ferns
and
vines
root
themselves
and
twine
and
ramble
and
hang
in
festoons
above
the
leaves
thirty
feet
long
fall
in
a
feathery
arch
and
in
the
centre
like
the
waters
of
a
fountain
shoot
up
bright
yellow
drooping
branches
that
look
like
coral
these
are
the
the
fruit
in
this
climate
does
not
ripen
so
as
to
be
good
for
any
thing
one
gentleman
showed
me
a
young
palm
now
six
feet
high
which
he
had
raised
from
a
seed
of
the
common
shop
date
planted
four
years
ago
in
this
same
garden
he
showed
me
enormous
which
he
had
formed
by
budding
the
finest
of
the
bourbon
roses
in
the
native
florida
rose
the
growth
in
three
years
had
been
incredible
and
these
trees
are
an
fountain
of
fresh
roses
there
is
a
in
augustine
in
a
little
garden
which
all
the
go
to
see
it
is
a
tree
with
a
trunk
about
the
size
of
an
ordinary
man
arm
and
is
said
to
have
had
a
thousand
roses
on
it
at
a
time
half
that
number
will
answer
our
purpose
and
we
will
set
it
down
at
that
and
are
pests
unheard
of
here
the
rose
grows
as
in
its
native
home
one
very
pretty
feature
of
the
houses
here
struck
me
agreeably
there
is
oftentimes
a
sort
of
shaded
walk
under
half
the
house
opening
upon
the
garden
you
go
up
a
dusty
street
and
stand
at
a
door
which
you
expect
will
open
into
a
hall
it
opens
and
a
garden
full
of
flowers
and
trees
meets
your
view
the
surprise
is
delightful
in
one
garden
that
we
visited
we
saw
a
in
bud
the
stalk
was
nineteen
feet
high
and
the
blossoms
seemed
to
promise
to
be
similar
to
those
of
the
yucca
the
leaves
are
like
the
aloe
only
longer
and
twisted
and
contorted
in
a
strange
weird
fashion
on
the
whole
it
looked
as
if
it
might
have
been
one
of
the
strange
plants
in
rappicini
garden
in
padua
the
society
in
augustine
though
not
extensive
is
very
delightful
we
met
and
were
introduced
to
some
very
cultivated
agreeable
people
there
is
a
fair
prospect
that
the
city
will
soon
be
united
by
railroad
to
jacksonville
which
will
greatly
add
to
the
facility
and
convenience
of
living
there
we
recrossed
the
railroad
at
tekoi
on
our
way
home
in
company
with
a
party
of
gentlemen
who
are
investigating
that
road
with
a
view
of
putting
capital
into
it
and
so
getting
it
into
active
running
order
one
of
them
informed
me
that
he
was
also
going
to
indian
river
to
explore
in
view
of
the
projected
plan
to
unite
it
with
the
by
means
of
a
canal
very
sensibly
he
remarked
that
in
order
to
really
make
up
one
mind
about
florida
one
should
see
it
in
summer
to
which
we
heartily
assented
by
all
these
means
this
beautiful
country
is
being
laid
open
and
made
accessible
and
inhabitable
as
a
home
and
refuge
for
those
who
need
it
on
the
steamboat
coming
back
we
met
the
florida
thoreau
of
whom
we
before
spoke
a
devoted
enthusiastic
lover
of
nature
as
she
reveals
herself
in
the
most
secluded
everglades
and
forests
he
supports
himself
and
pays
the
expenses
of
his
tours
by
selling
the
curiosities
of
nature
which
he
obtains
to
the
crowd
of
eager
visitors
who
throng
the
hotels
in
winter
the
feathers
of
the
pink
curlew
the
heron
the
crane
the
teeth
of
alligators
the
skins
of
deer
panther
and
are
among
his
trophies
he
asserted
with
vehemence
that
there
were
varieties
of
birds
in
florida
unknown
as
yet
to
any
collection
of
natural
history
he
excited
us
greatly
by
speaking
of
a
pair
of
pet
pink
curlews
which
had
been
tamed
also
of
a
stork
with
epaulet
on
each
shoulder
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
everglades
he
was
going
to
spend
the
whole
summer
alone
in
these
regions
or
only
with
indian
guides
and
seemed
cheerful
and
enthusiastic
he
should
find
plenty
of
cocoanuts
and
would
never
need
to
have
a
fever
if
he
would
eat
daily
of
the
wild
oranges
which
abound
if
one
only
could
go
in
spirit
and
not
in
flesh
one
would
like
to
follow
him
into
the
everglades
the
tropical
forests
of
florida
contain
visions
and
wonders
of
growth
and
glory
never
yet
revealed
to
the
eye
of
the
common
traveller
and
which
he
who
sees
must
risk
much
to
explore
our
best
wishes
go
with
our
enthusiast
may
he
live
to
tell
us
what
he
sees
illustration
our
neighbor
over
the
way
mandarin
may
our
neighbor
over
the
way
is
not
to
be
sure
quite
so
near
or
so
observable
as
if
one
lived
on
fifth
avenue
or
broadway
between
us
and
his
cottage
lie
five
good
miles
of
molten
silver
in
the
shape
of
the
john
river
outspread
this
morning
in
all
its
quivering
sheen
glancing
dimpling
and
sparkling
dotted
with
and
occasionally
ploughed
by
steamboats
gliding
like
white
swans
back
and
forth
across
the
distance
far
over
on
the
other
side
where
the
wooded
shores
melt
into
pearly
blue
outlines
gleams
out
in
the
morning
sun
a
white
glimmering
spot
about
as
big
as
a
ninepence
which
shows
us
where
his
cottage
stands
thither
we
are
going
to
make
a
morning
visit
our
is
now
approaching
the
little
wharf
front
of
our
house
and
we
sally
forth
equipped
with
our
for
the
middle
of
may
here
is
like
the
middle
of
august
at
the
north
the
or
rather
omnibus
is
a
little
thimble
of
a
steamer
built
for
pleasuring
on
the
john
called
the
mary
draper
she
is
a
tiny
shell
of
a
thing
but
with
a
nice
pretty
cabin
and
capable
of
carrying
comfortably
thirty
or
forty
passengers
during
the
height
of
the
the
mary
draper
is
let
out
to
parties
of
tourists
who
choose
thus
at
their
leisure
to
explore
the
river
sailing
landing
rambling
exploring
hunting
fishing
and
perhaps
inevitably
flirting
among
the
flowery
nooks
and
of
the
shore
we
have
seen
her
many
a
time
coming
gayly
back
from
an
excursion
with
the
voice
of
singing
and
laugh
of
youths
and
maidens
resounding
from
her
deck
and
like
some
fabled
bark
from
the
fairy
isles
but
now
in
the
middle
of
may
the
tourists
are
few
and
so
the
mary
draper
has
been
turned
into
a
sort
of
plying
up
and
down
the
river
to
serve
the
needs
and
convenience
of
the
permanent
inhabitants
a
flag
shown
upon
our
wharf
brings
her
in
at
our
need
and
we
step
gayly
on
board
to
be
carried
across
to
our
neighbors
we
take
our
seats
at
the
shaded
end
of
the
boat
and
watch
the
retreating
shore
with
its
gigantic
rising
like
a
dome
above
the
its
clouds
of
pink
that
seem
every
week
to
blossom
fuller
than
the
last
and
for
a
little
moment
we
can
catch
the
glimmer
of
the
great
cape
that
bends
beneath
the
weight
of
flowers
at
the
end
of
our
veranda
our
little
cottage
looks
like
a
rabbit
nest
beside
the
monster
oaks
that
shade
it
but
it
is
cosey
to
see
them
all
out
on
the
low
veranda
the
professor
with
his
newspapers
the
ladies
with
their
worsteds
and
baskets
in
fact
the
whole
of
our
large
family
all
reading
writing
working
in
the
shady
covert
of
the
from
time
to
time
a
handkerchief
is
waved
on
their
part
and
the
signal
returned
on
ours
and
they
follow
our
receding
motions
with
a
spyglass
our
life
is
so
still
and
lonely
here
that
even
so
small
an
event
as
our
crossing
the
river
for
a
visit
is
but
after
a
little
our
craft
melts
off
into
the
distance
the
mary
draper
looks
to
our
friends
no
larger
than
a
and
the
trees
of
the
other
side
loom
up
strong
and
tall
in
our
eyes
and
grow
clearer
and
clearer
while
our
home
with
its
great
and
its
has
all
melted
into
a
soft
woolly
haze
of
distance
our
next
neighbor
great
whitewashed
barn
is
the
only
sign
of
habitation
remaining
and
that
flashes
out
a
mere
shining
speck
in
the
distance
now
the
boat
comes
up
to
wharf
and
he
is
there
to
meet
and
welcome
us
one
essential
to
every
on
the
john
is
this
accessory
of
a
wharf
and
boathouse
the
river
is
for
a
greater
or
less
distance
from
the
shore
too
shallow
to
admit
the
approach
of
steamboats
and
wharves
of
fifty
or
a
hundred
feet
in
length
are
needed
to
enable
passengers
to
land
the
bottom
of
the
river
is
of
hard
sparkling
white
sand
into
which
spiles
are
easily
driven
and
the
building
and
of
such
a
wharf
is
a
trifling
trouble
and
expense
in
a
land
where
lumber
is
so
plentiful
our
friend
is
like
many
other
old
floridian
residents
originally
from
the
north
in
early
youth
he
came
to
florida
a
condemned
and
doomed
consumptive
recovered
his
health
and
has
lived
a
long
and
happy
life
here
and
acquired
a
handsome
property
he
owns
extensive
tracts
of
rich
and
beautiful
land
on
the
west
bank
of
the
john
between
it
and
jacksonville
destined
as
that
city
grows
and
extends
to
become
of
increasing
value
his
wife
like
himself
originally
of
northern
origin
has
become
perfectly
acclimated
and
naturalized
by
years
residence
at
the
south
and
is
to
all
intents
and
purposes
a
southern
woman
they
live
all
the
year
upon
their
place
those
who
formerly
were
their
slaves
settled
peaceably
around
them
as
free
laborers
still
looking
up
to
them
for
advice
depending
on
them
for
aid
and
rendering
to
them
the
willing
services
of
freemen
their
house
is
a
simple
white
cottage
situated
so
as
to
command
a
noble
view
of
the
river
a
long
avenue
of
young
leads
up
from
the
river
to
the
house
the
ground
is
covered
with
a
smooth
even
turf
of
bermuda
grass
the
only
kind
that
will
endure
the
burning
glare
of
the
tropical
summer
the
walls
of
the
house
are
covered
with
roses
now
in
full
bloom
la
marque
and
many
another
kind
throw
out
their
splendid
clusters
and
fill
the
air
with
fragrance
we
find
and
her
family
on
the
veranda
the
usual
in
a
southern
house
the
house
is
the
seat
of
hospitality
every
room
in
it
sure
to
be
full
if
not
with
the
members
of
the
family
proper
then
with
guests
from
jacksonville
who
find
in
this
high
breezy
situation
a
charming
retreat
from
the
heat
of
the
city
one
feature
is
characteristic
of
southern
houses
so
far
as
we
have
seen
the
ladies
are
enthusiastic
and
the
veranda
is
lined
round
with
an
array
of
boxes
in
which
gardening
experiments
are
carried
on
rare
plants
slips
choice
seedlings
are
here
nurtured
and
cared
for
in
fact
the
burning
power
of
the
tropical
sun
and
the
scalding
fine
white
sand
is
such
that
to
put
a
tender
plant
or
slip
into
it
seems
in
the
words
of
scripture
like
casting
it
into
the
oven
and
so
there
is
everywhere
more
or
less
of
this
the
cottage
was
all
in
summer
array
the
carpets
taken
up
and
packed
away
leaving
the
smooth
yellow
pine
floors
clean
and
cool
as
the
french
parquets
the
plan
of
the
cottage
is
the
very
common
one
of
southern
houses
a
wide
clear
hall
furnished
as
a
opening
on
a
veranda
on
either
end
goes
through
the
house
and
all
the
other
rooms
open
upon
it
we
sat
chatting
first
on
the
veranda
and
as
the
sun
grew
hotter
retreated
inward
to
the
hall
and
discussed
flowers
farm
and
dairy
on
the
east
bank
of
the
john
where
our
own
residence
is
immediately
around
mandarin
the
pasturage
is
poor
and
the
cattle
diminutive
and
half
starved
knowing
that
our
neighbor
was
an
old
resident
and
enthusiastic
and
breeder
we
came
to
him
for
knowledge
on
these
subjects
has
received
a
great
share
of
attention
from
the
larger
planters
of
florida
the
small
breed
of
wild
native
florida
cattle
has
been
crossed
and
improved
by
foreign
stock
imported
at
great
expense
the
brahmin
cattle
of
india
as
coming
from
a
tropical
region
were
thought
specially
adapted
to
the
floridian
climate
and
have
thriven
well
here
by
crossing
these
with
the
durham
and
ayrshire
and
the
native
cattle
fine
varieties
of
animals
have
been
obtained
showed
me
a
list
of
fifty
of
his
finest
cows
each
one
of
which
has
its
distinguishing
name
and
with
whose
pedigree
and
peculiarities
he
seemed
well
acquainted
in
rearing
the
floridian
system
has
always
been
to
make
every
thing
subservient
to
the
increase
of
the
herd
the
calf
is
allowed
to
run
with
the
cow
and
the
supply
of
milk
for
the
human
being
is
only
what
is
over
and
above
the
wants
of
the
calf
the
usual
mode
of
milking
is
to
leave
the
calf
sucking
on
one
side
while
the
milker
sits
on
the
other
and
gets
his
portion
it
is
an
opinion
fixed
as
fate
in
the
mind
of
every
negro
that
to
kill
a
calf
would
be
the
death
of
the
mother
and
that
if
you
separate
the
calf
from
the
mother
her
milk
will
dry
up
fresh
veal
is
a
delicacy
unheard
of
and
once
when
we
suggested
a
to
a
strapping
ethiopian
she
appeared
as
much
shocked
as
if
we
had
proposed
to
fricassee
a
baby
however
expressed
his
conviction
that
the
northern
method
of
taking
off
the
calf
and
securing
the
cow
milk
could
be
practised
with
success
and
had
been
in
one
or
two
cases
the
yield
of
milk
of
some
of
the
best
blood
cows
was
quite
equal
to
that
of
northern
milkers
and
might
be
kept
up
by
good
feeding
as
a
rule
however
depend
for
their
supply
of
milk
more
on
the
number
of
their
herd
than
the
quantity
given
by
each
the
expenses
of
raising
are
not
heavy
where
there
is
a
wide
expanse
of
good
for
them
to
range
in
and
no
necessity
for
shelters
of
any
kind
through
the
year
spoke
of
the
as
being
a
real
and
valuable
species
of
pasturage
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
the
flats
and
shallows
along
by
the
shore
are
covered
with
a
very
tender
and
nutritious
of
which
cattle
are
very
fond
it
is
a
curious
sight
to
see
whole
herds
of
cows
browsing
in
the
water
as
one
may
do
every
day
along
the
course
of
this
river
the
subject
of
came
up
and
at
our
request
led
the
way
to
hers
it
is
built
out
under
a
dense
shade
of
trees
in
an
airy
situation
with
double
walls
like
an
the
sight
of
the
snowy
shelves
set
round
with
pans
on
which
a
rich
golden
cream
was
forming
was
a
sufficient
testimony
that
there
could
be
beautiful
dairies
in
florida
notwithstanding
its
tropical
heats
the
butter
is
made
every
morning
at
an
early
hour
and
we
had
an
opportunity
of
tasting
it
at
the
like
the
best
butter
of
france
and
england
it
is
sweet
and
pure
like
solidified
cream
and
as
different
as
can
be
from
the
hard
salty
mass
which
most
generally
passes
for
butter
among
us
the
buttermilk
of
a
daily
churning
is
also
sweet
and
rich
a
delicious
nourishing
drink
and
an
excellent
adjuvant
in
the
making
of
various
cakes
and
other
household
delicacies
our
friend
experience
satisfied
us
that
there
was
no
earthly
reason
in
the
climate
or
surroundings
of
florida
why
milk
and
butter
should
be
the
scarce
and
expensive
luxuries
they
are
now
what
one
private
gentleman
can
do
simply
for
his
own
comfort
and
that
of
his
family
we
should
think
might
be
repeated
on
a
larger
scale
by
somebody
in
the
neighborhood
of
jacksonville
as
a
money
speculation
along
the
western
bank
of
this
river
are
hundreds
of
tracts
of
good
grazing
land
where
cattle
might
be
pastured
at
small
expense
where
the
products
of
a
dairy
on
a
large
scale
would
meet
a
ready
and
certain
sale
at
present
the
hotels
and
are
supplied
with
condensed
milk
and
butter
imported
from
the
north
and
yet
land
is
cheap
here
labor
is
reasonable
the
climate
genial
requiring
no
outlay
for
shelter
and
comparatively
little
necessity
of
storing
food
for
winter
fine
breeds
of
animals
of
improved
stock
exist
already
and
can
be
indefinitely
increased
and
we
wonder
that
nobody
is
to
be
found
to
improve
the
opportunity
to
run
a
stock
and
dairy
farm
which
shall
supply
the
hotels
and
of
jacksonville
after
visiting
the
dairy
we
sauntered
about
looking
at
the
where
different
breeds
of
hens
turkeys
had
each
their
allotted
station
four
or
five
big
dogs
hounds
and
pointers
trotted
round
with
us
or
rollicked
with
a
party
of
grandchildren
assisted
by
the
addition
of
a
band
of
giggling
little
negroes
as
in
the
old
times
the
servants
of
the
family
have
their
little
houses
back
of
the
premises
and
the
is
carried
on
outside
the
propensity
at
the
south
is
to
multiply
little
buildings
at
the
north
where
there
is
a
winter
to
be
calculated
on
the
tactics
of
living
are
different
the
effort
is
to
gather
all
the
needs
and
wants
of
life
under
one
roof
to
be
warmed
and
kept
in
order
at
small
expense
in
the
south
where
is
cheap
and
building
is
a
slight
matter
there
is
a
separate
little
building
for
every
thing
and
the
back
part
of
an
estate
looks
like
an
eruption
of
little
houses
there
is
a
a
a
a
besides
a
house
for
each
of
the
leading
servants
making
quite
a
village
our
dinner
was
a
bountiful
display
of
the
luxuries
of
a
southern
farm
fowl
choicely
cooked
fish
from
the
river
with
such
a
tempting
variety
of
early
vegetables
as
seemed
to
make
it
impossible
to
do
justice
to
all
offered
us
a
fine
sparkling
wine
made
of
the
juice
of
the
in
color
it
resembled
the
finest
sherry
and
was
much
like
it
in
flavor
we
could
not
help
thinking
as
we
refused
dainty
after
dainty
from
mere
inability
to
take
more
of
the
thoughtless
way
in
which
it
is
often
said
that
there
can
be
nothing
fit
to
eat
got
in
florida
family
is
supplied
with
food
almost
entirely
from
the
products
of
his
own
farm
he
has
the
nicest
of
fed
beef
nice
tender
pork
poultry
of
all
sorts
besides
the
resources
of
an
ample
dairy
he
raises
and
makes
his
own
sirup
he
has
corn
and
all
northern
vegetables
in
perfection
peaches
grapes
of
finest
quality
besides
the
strictly
tropical
fruits
and
all
that
he
has
any
other
farmer
might
also
have
with
the
same
care
after
dinner
we
walked
out
to
look
at
the
grapes
which
hung
in
profuse
clusters
just
beginning
to
ripen
on
the
vines
on
our
way
we
stopped
to
admire
a
great
which
seemed
to
make
hesperian
fables
true
it
was
about
thirty
feet
in
height
and
with
branches
that
drooped
to
the
ground
weighed
down
at
the
same
time
with
great
golden
balls
of
fruit
and
wreaths
of
pearly
buds
and
blossoms
every
stage
of
fruit
from
the
tiny
green
ball
of
a
month
growth
to
the
perfected
orange
were
here
all
the
processes
of
life
going
on
together
in
joyous
unity
the
tree
exemplified
what
an
could
become
when
fully
fed
when
its
almost
boundless
capacity
for
digesting
nutriment
meets
a
full
supply
and
it
certainly
stood
one
of
the
most
royal
of
trees
its
leaves
were
large
broad
and
of
that
glossy
varnished
green
peculiar
to
the
orange
and
its
young
shoots
looked
like
burnished
gold
the
orange
is
much
prized
by
some
the
pulp
is
sweet
with
a
certain
spicy
flavor
but
the
rind
and
all
the
inner
membranes
that
contain
the
fruit
are
bitter
as
quinine
itself
it
is
held
to
be
healthy
to
eat
of
both
as
the
acid
and
the
bitter
are
held
to
be
alike
correctives
of
the
bilious
tendencies
of
the
climate
but
the
afternoon
sun
was
casting
the
shadows
the
other
way
and
the
little
buzzing
mary
draper
was
seen
puffing
in
the
distance
on
her
way
back
from
jacksonville
and
we
walked
leisurely
down
the
avenues
to
the
wharf
our
hands
full
of
roses
and
oriental
jessamine
and
many
pleasant
memories
of
our
neighbors
over
the
way
and
now
in
relation
to
the
general
subject
of
farming
in
florida
our
own
region
east
of
the
john
river
is
properly
a
little
sandy
belt
of
land
about
eighteen
miles
wide
washed
by
the
atlantic
ocean
on
one
side
and
the
john
river
on
the
other
it
is
not
by
any
means
so
well
adapted
to
or
general
farming
as
the
western
side
of
the
river
its
principal
value
is
in
and
it
will
appear
by
a
voyage
up
the
river
that
all
the
finest
old
and
all
the
new
are
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
river
the
presence
on
either
side
of
two
great
bodies
of
water
produces
a
more
moist
and
equable
climate
and
less
liability
to
frosts
in
the
great
freeze
of
the
of
the
west
bank
were
killed
beyond

we
will
close
this
chapter
with
an
extract
from
a
letter
of
a
northern
emigrant
recently
settled
at
newport
on
the
north
part
of
appalachicola
bay
i
have
been
haying
this
month
in
fact
i
had
mowed
my
a
square
of
two
acres
from
time
to
time
all
summer
but
this
month
a
field
of
two
acres
had
a
heavy
burden
of
grass
with
intermixed
in
some
parts
of
the
field
there
certainly
would
be
at
the
rate
of
three
tons
to
the
acre
the
whole
field
would
average
one
ton
to
the
acre
so
i
went
at
it
with
a
good
northern
scythe
and
mowed
every
morning
an
hour
or
two
the
hay
was
perfectly
cured
by
five
same
day
and
put
in
barn
the
land
being
in
ridges
made
mowing
difficult
next
year
i
mean
to
lay
that
land
down
to
grass
taking
out
stumps
and
making
smooth
sowing
rye
and
clover
i
shall
plough
it
now
as
soon
as
the
hay
is
all
made
and
sow
the
rye
and
clover
immediately
i
have
five
cows
that
give
milk
and
four
that
should
come
in
soon
these
with
their
calves
i
shall
feed
through
the
months
when
the
grass
is
poor
i
have
also
a
yoke
of
oxen
and
four
young
steers
with
trim
the
mule
i
have
already
in
the
barn
three
to
four
tons
of
hay
and
and
two
acres
of
cured
to
be
used
as
hay
i
hope
to
have
five
hundred
bushels
of
which
for
stock
are
equal
to
corn
i
made
a
hundred
and
ten
bushels
of
corn
to
the
acre
my
cane
is
doing
moderately
well
hope
to
have
all
the
seed
i
want
to
plant
fourteen
acres
next
year
bananas
thrive
beautifully
shall
have
fifty
offsets
to
set
out
this
winter
also
three
or
four
thousand
oranges
all
and
fair
all
these
facts
go
to
show
that
while
florida
can
not
compete
with
the
northern
and
western
states
as
a
state
yet
there
are
other
advantages
in
her
climate
and
productions
which
make
feasible
and
profitable
the
disadvantages
of
her
burning
climate
may
to
a
degree
be
evaded
and
overcome
by
the
application
of
the
same
patient
industry
and
ingenuity
which
rendered
fruitful
the
iron
soil
and
freezing
climate
of
the
states
illustration
the
grand
tour
up
river
the
john
is
the
grand
through
some
of
the
most
beautiful
portions
of
florida
and
tourists
safely
seated
at
ease
on
the
decks
of
steamers
can
penetrate
into
the
mysteries
and
wonders
of
unbroken
tropical
forests
during
the
season
boats
continually
run
from
jacksonville
to
enterprise
and
back
again
the
round
trip
being
made
for
a
moderate
sum
and
giving
in
a
very
easy
and
comparatively
inexpensive
manner
as
much
of
the
peculiar
scenery
as
mere
tourists
care
to
see
on
returning
a
digression
is
often
made
at
tekoi
where
passengers
cross
a
of
fifteen
miles
to
augustine
thus
rendering
their
survey
of
east
florida
more
complete
in
fact
what
may
be
seen
and
known
of
the
state
in
such
a
trip
is
about
all
that
the
majority
of
tourists
see
and
know
the
great
majority
also
perform
this
trip
and
see
this
region
in
the
dead
of
winter
when
certainly
of
the
glorious
forests
upon
the
shore
are
bare
of
leaves
it
is
true
that
the
great
number
of
here
make
the
shores
at
all
times
quite
different
from
those
of
a
northern
climate
yet
the
difference
between
spring
and
winter
is
as
great
here
as
there
our
party
were
resolute
in
declining
all
invitations
to
join
parties
in
january
february
and
march
being
determined
to
wait
till
the
new
spring
foliage
was
in
its
glory
when
the
were
beginning
to
blossom
we
were
ready
and
took
passage
a
joyous
party
of
eight
or
ten
individuals
on
the
steamer
darlington
commanded
by
capt
broch
and
as
is
often
asserted
by
commodore
rose
this
latter
in
this
day
of
woman
rights
is
no
mean
example
of
female
energy
and
vigor
she
is
stewardess
of
the
boat
and
magnifies
her
office
she
is
a
colored
woman
once
a
slave
owned
by
capt
broch
but
emancipated
as
the
story
goes
for
her
courage
and
presence
of
mind
in
saving
his
life
in
a
steamboat
disaster
rose
is
short
and
thick
weighing
some
two
or
three
hundred
with
a
brown
complexion
and
a
pleasing
face
and
fine
eyes
her
voice
like
that
of
most
colored
women
is
soft
and
her
manner
of
speaking
pleasing
all
this
however
relates
to
her
demeanor
when
making
the
agreeable
to
passengers
in
other
circumstances
doubtless
she
can
speak
louder
and
with
considerable
more
emphasis
and
show
in
short
those
martial
attributes
which
have
won
for
her
the
appellation
of
the
commodore
it
is
asserted
that
the
whole
charge
of
provisioning
and
running
the
boat
and
all
its
internal
arrangements
vests
in
madam
rose
and
that
nobody
can
get
ahead
of
her
in
a
bargain
or
resist
her
will
in
an
arrangement
she
knows
every
inch
of
the
river
every
house
every
plantation
along
shore
its
former
or
present
occupants
and
history
and
is
always
ready
with
an
answer
to
a
question
the
arrangement
and
keeping
of
the
boat
do
honor
to
her
nowhere
in
florida
does
the
guest
sit
at
a
more
table
our
desserts
and
pastry
were
really
for
the
wilderness
something
quite
astonishing
the
john
river
below
pilatka
has
few
distinguishing
features
to
mark
it
out
from
other
great
rivers
it
is
so
wide
that
the
foliage
of
the
shores
can
not
be
definitely
made
out
and
the
tourist
here
expecting
his
and
his
magnolias
and
is
disappointed
by
sailing
in
what
seems
a
great
lake
where
the
shores
are
off
in
the
distance
too
far
to
make
out
any
thing
in
particular
but
after
leaving
pilatka
the
river
grows
narrower
the
overhanging
banks
approach
nearer
and
the
foliage
becomes
more
decidedly
tropical
in
its
character
our
boat
after
touching
as
usual
at
hibernia
magnolia
and
green
cove
brought
up
at
pilatka
late
in
the
afternoon
made
but
a
short
stop
and
was
on
her
way
again
it
was
the
first
part
of
may
and
the
forests
were
in
that
fulness
of
leafy
perfection
which
they
attain
in
the
month
of
june
at
the
north
but
there
is
a
peculiar
vivid
brilliancy
about
the
green
of
the
new
here
which
we
never
saw
elsewhere
it
is
a
brilliancy
like
some
of
the
new
french
greens
now
so
much
in
vogue
and
reminding
one
of
the
metallic
brightness
of
birds
and
insects
in
the
woods
the
cypress
is
a
singular
and
beautiful
feature
it
attains
to
a
great
age
and
immense
size
the
trunk
and
branches
of
an
old
cypress
are
smooth
and
white
as
ivory
while
its
light
feathery
foliage
is
of
the
most
dazzling
and
rising
as
it
often
does
amid
clumps
of
dark
varnished
evergreens
bay
and
magnolia
and
myrtle
it
has
a
singular
and
beautiful
effect
the
long
swaying
draperies
of
the
gray
moss
interpose
everywhere
their
wavering
outlines
and
pearl
tints
amid
the
brightness
and
bloom
of
the
forest
giving
to
its
deep
recesses
the
mystery
of
grottoes
hung
with
fanciful
vegetable
stalactites
the
appears
in
all
stages
from
its
earliest
growth
when
it
looks
like
a
fountain
of
great
green
bursting
from
the
earth
to
its
perfect
shape
when
sixty
or
seventy
feet
in
height
it
rears
its
fan
crown
high
in
air
the
oldest
trees
may
be
known
by
a
perfectly
smooth
trunk
all
traces
of
the
scaly
formation
by
which
it
has
built
itself
up
in
ring
after
ring
of
leaves
being
obliterated
but
younger
trees
thirty
or
forty
feet
in
height
often
show
a
trunk
which
seems
to
present
a
regular
of
the
remaining
scales
from
whence
the
old
leaves
have
decayed
and
dropped
away
these
scaly
trunks
are
often
full
of
ferns
wild
flowers
and
vines
which
hang
in
fantastic
draperies
down
their
sides
and
form
leafy
and
flowery
pillars
the
as
they
are
called
are
often
miles
in
extent
along
the
banks
of
the
rivers
the
tops
of
the
palms
rise
up
round
in
the
distance
as
so
many
and
seeming
to
rise
one
above
another
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
we
have
never
been
so
fortunate
as
to
be
able
to
explore
one
of
these
the
boat
sails
with
a
provoking
quickness
by
many
a
scene
that
one
longs
to
dwell
upon
study
and
investigate
we
have
been
told
however
by
hunters
that
they
afford
admirable
being
generally
high
and
dry
with
a
flooring
of
clean
white
sand
their
broad
leaves
are
a
perfect
protection
from
rain
and
dew
and
the
effect
of
the
glare
of
the
campfires
and
on
the
tall
pillars
and
waving
canopy
overhead
is
said
to
be
perfectly
magical
the
most
unromantic
and
least
impressible
speak
of
it
with
enthusiasm
in
going
up
the
river
darkness
overtook
us
shortly
after
leaving
pilatka
we
sat
in
a
golden
twilight
and
saw
the
shores
every
moment
becoming
more
beautiful
but
when
the
twilight
faded
and
there
was
no
moon
we
sought
the
repose
of
our
cabin
it
was
sultry
as
august
although
only
the
first
part
of
may
and
our
younger
and
sprightlier
members
who
were
on
the
less
breezy
side
of
the
boat
after
fruitlessly
trying
to
sleep
arose
and
dressed
themselves
and
sat
all
night
on
deck
by
this
means
they
saw
a
sight
worth
seeing
and
one
which
we
should
have
watched
all
night
to
see
the
boat
course
at
night
is
through
narrows
of
the
river
where
we
could
hear
the
crashing
and
crackling
of
bushes
and
trees
and
sometimes
a
violent
thud
as
the
boat
in
turning
a
winding
struck
against
the
bank
on
the
forward
part
two
great
braziers
were
kept
filled
with
blazing
resinous
to
guide
the
pilot
in
the
path
of
the
boat
the
effect
of
this
glare
of
red
light
as
the
steamer
passed
through
the
palmetto
hummocks
and
grottoes
of
the
forest
was
something
that
must
have
been
indescribably
weird
and
beautiful
and
our
young
friends
made
us
suitably
regret
that
our
more
airy
had
lost
us
this
experience
in
the
morning
we
woke
at
enterprise
having
come
through
all
the
most
beautiful
and
characteristic
part
of
the
way
by
night
enterprise
is
some
hundred
and
thirty
miles
south
of
our
in
mandarin
and
of
course
that
much
nearer
the
tropical
regions
we
had
planned
excursions
explorations
picnics
in
the
woods
and
a
visit
to
the
beautiful
spring
in
the
neighborhood
but
learned
with
chagrin
that
the
boat
made
so
short
a
stay
that
none
of
these
things
were
possible
the
only
thing
that
appears
to
the
naked
eye
of
a
steamboat
traveller
in
enterprise
is
a
large
hotel
down
upon
the
landing
said
by
those
who
have
tested
it
to
be
one
of
the
best
kept
hotels
in
florida
the
aspect
of
the
shore
just
there
is
no
way
picturesque
or
inviting
but
has
more
that
forlorn
ragged
desolate
air
that
new
settlements
on
the
river
are
apt
to
have
the
wild
untouched
banks
are
beautiful
but
the
new
settlements
generally
succeed
in
destroying
all
nature
beauty
and
give
you
only
leafless
girdled
trees
blackened
stumps
and
naked
white
sand
in
return
turning
our
boat
homeward
we
sailed
in
clear
morning
light
back
through
the
charming
scenery
which
we
had
slept
through
the
night
before
it
is
the
most
wild
enchanting
sail
conceivable
the
river
sometimes
narrows
so
that
the
boat
brushes
under
overhanging
branches
and
then
widens
into
beautiful
lakes
dotted
with
wooded
islands
groves
cypress
pine
bay
and
magnolia
form
an
interchanging
picture
vines
hang
festooned
from
tree
to
tree
wild
flowers
tempt
the
eye
on
the
near
banks
and
one
is
constantly
longing
for
the
boat
to
delay
here
or
there
but
on
goes
her
steady
course
the
pictured
scene
around
constantly
changing
every
now
and
then
the
woods
break
away
for
a
little
space
and
one
sees
orange
and
banana
orchards
and
houses
evidently
newly
built
at
many
points
the
boat
landed
and
put
off
kegs
of
nails
hoes
ploughs
provisions
groceries
some
few
old
plantations
were
passed
whose
name
and
history
seemed
familiar
to
madam
rose
but
by
far
the
greater
number
were
new
settlements
with
orchards
of
quite
young
trees
which
will
require
three
or
four
more
years
to
bring
into
bearing
the
greater
number
of
and
settlements
were
on
the
eastern
shore
of
the
river
which
for
the
reasons
we
have
spoken
of
is
better
adapted
to
the
culture
of
fruit
one
annoyance
on
board
the
boat
was
the
constant
and
pertinacious
firing
kept
up
by
that
class
of
men
who
think
that
the
chief
end
of
man
is
to
shoot
something
now
we
can
put
up
with
good
earnest
hunting
or
fishing
done
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
for
man
food
or
even
the
fur
and
feathers
that
hit
his
fancy
and
taste
but
we
detest
indiscriminate
and
purposeless
maiming
and
killing
of
happy
animals
who
have
but
one
life
to
live
and
for
whom
the
agony
of
broken
bones
or
torn
flesh
is
a
helpless
hopeless
pain
unrelieved
by
any
of
the
resources
which
enable
us
to
endure
a
parcel
of
hulking
fellows
sit
on
the
deck
of
a
boat
and
pass
through
the
sweetest
paradise
god
ever
made
without
one
idea
of
its
loveliness
one
gentle
sympathizing
thought
of
the
animal
happiness
with
which
the
creator
has
filled
these
recesses
all
the
way
along
is
a
constant
fusillade
upon
every
living
thing
that
shows
itself
on
the
bank
now
a
bird
is
hit
and
hangs
head
downward
with
a
broken
wing
and
a
coarse
laugh
choruses
the
deed
now
an
alligator
is
struck
and
the
applause
is
greater
we
once
saw
a
harmless
young
alligator
whose
dying
struggles
as
he
threw
out
his
poor
little
black
paws
piteously
like
human
hands
seemed
to
be
vastly
diverting
to
these
cultivated
individuals
they
wanted
nothing
of
him
except
to
see
how
he
would
act
when
he
was
hit
dying
agonies
are
so
very
amusing
now
and
then
these
sons
of
nimrod
in
their
zeal
put
in
peril
the
nerves
if
not
lives
of
passengers
one
such
actually
fired
at
an
alligator
right
across
a
crowd
of
ladies
many
of
them
invalids
and
persisted
in
so
firing
a
second
time
after
having
been
requested
to
desist
if
the
object
were
merely
to
show
the
skill
of
the
marksman
why
not
practise
upon
inanimate
objects
an
old
log
looks
much
like
an
alligator
why
not
practise
on
an
old
log
it
requires
as
much
skill
to
hit
a
branch
as
the
bird
singing
on
it
why
not
practise
on
the
branch
but
no
it
must
be
something
that
and
can
suffer
something
that
loves
life
and
must
lose
it
certainly
this
is
an
inherent
savagery
difficult
to
account
for
killing
for
killing
sake
belongs
not
even
to
the
tiger
the
tiger
kills
for
food
man
for
amusement
at
evening
we
were
again
at
pilatka
when
the
great
question
was
discussed
would
we
or
would
we
not
take
the
tour
up
the
okalewaha
to
see
the
enchanted
wonders
of
the
silver
spring
the
okalewaha
boat
lay
at
the
landing
and
we
went
to
look
at
it
the
okalewaha
is
a
deep
narrow
stream
by
the
by
emptying
into
the
john
with
a
course
as
crooked
as
apollo
ram
horn
and
a
boat
has
been
constructed
for
the
express
purpose
of
this
passage
the
aspect
of
this
same
boat
on
a
hot
night
was
not
inspiriting
it
was
low
long
and
narrow
its
sides
were
rubbed
glassy
smooth
or
torn
and
creased
by
the
friction
of
the
bushes
and
trees
it
had
pushed
through
it
was
without
glass
windows
which
would
be
of
no
use
in
such
navigation
and
in
place
thereof
furnished
with
strong
shutters
to
close
the
we
looked
at
this
same
thing
as
it
lay
like
a
gigantic
coffin
in
the
twilight
and
thought
even
the
silver
spring
would
not
pay
for
being
immured
there
and
turned
away
a
more
inviting
project
was
to
step
into
a
and
be
taken
in
the
golden
twilight
over
to
harte
which
is
said
with
reason
we
believe
to
be
the
finest
in
florida
we
landed
in
the
twilight
in
this
grove
of
six
hundred
beautiful
in
as
high
condition
as
the
best
culture
could
make
them
the
is
known
by
the
glossy
deep
green
of
its
foliage
as
a
declining
tree
is
by
the
yellow
tinge
of
its
leaves
these
trees
looked
as
if
each
leaf
if
broken
would
spurt
with
juice
piles
of
and
shell
banks
prepared
as
for
the
orchard
were
lying
everywhere
about
mingling
not
agreeably
with
the
odor
of
we
thought
to
ourselves
that
if
the
must
be
fed
upon
putrefying
fish
we
should
prefer
not
to
have
a
house
in
it
the
employee
who
has
charge
of
the
orchard
lives
in
a
cottage
in
the
edge
of
it
a
large
has
recently
been
built
there
and
the
experiments
of
harte
seem
to
demonstrate
that
even
if
there
occur
severe
frosts
in
the
early
winter
there
is
no
sort
of
need
therefore
of
losing
the
his
agent
showed
us
oranges
round
and
fair
that
had
been
kept
three
months
in
moss
in
this
and
looking
as
fresh
and
glossy
as
those
upon
the
trees
this
if
proved
by
experience
always
possible
does
away
with
the
only
uncertainty
relating
to
the
undoubtedly
the
fruit
is
far
better
to
continue
all
winter
on
the
trees
and
be
gathered
from
time
to
time
as
wanted
as
has
always
been
the
practice
in
florida
but
with
and
moss
it
will
be
possible
in
case
of
a
threatened
fall
of
temperature
to
secure
the
crop
the
oranges
that
come
to
us
from
malaga
and
sicily
are
green
as
grass
when
gathered
and
packed
and
ripen
as
much
as
they
do
ripen
on
the
voyage
over
we
should
suppose
the
oranges
of
florida
might
be
gathered
much
nearer
ripe
in
the
fall
ripen
in
the
house
or
on
the
way
and
still
be
far
better
than
any
from
the
foreign
market
on
this
point
are
now
instituting
experiments
which
we
trust
will
make
this
delicious
crop
certain
as
it
is
abundant
sailing
back
across
the
water
we
landed
and
were
conveyed
to
the
winter
of
a
brooklyn
gentleman
who
is
with
great
enthusiasm
cultivating
a
place
there
it
was
almost
dark
and
we
could
only
hear
of
his
gardens
and
grounds
and
improvements
not
see
them
in
the
morning
before
the
boat
left
the
landing
he
took
us
a
hasty
drive
around
the
streets
of
the
little
village
it
is
an
unusually
pretty
place
for
a
florida
settlement
one
reason
for
this
is
that
the
streets
and
vacant
lots
are
covered
with
a
fine
green
turf
which
at
a
distance
looks
like
our
grass
it
is
a
mixture
of
bermuda
grass
with
a
variety
of
herbage
and
has
just
as
good
general
effect
as
if
it
were
the
best
there
are
several
fine
residences
in
and
around
pilatka
mostly
of
northern
settlers
the
town
has
eight
stores
which
do
a
business
for
all
the
surrounding
country
for
miles
it
has
two
large
hotels
several
two
churches
two
steam
and
is
the
headquarters
for
the
steamboats
of
the
upper
john
and
its
tributaries
four
or
five
steamers
from
different
quarters
are
often
stopping
at
its
wharf
at
a
time
the
dictator
and
city
point
from
charleston
run
to
this
place
outside
by
the
ocean
passage
and
entering
the
mouth
of
the
john
stop
at
jacksonville
by
the
way
the
nick
king
and
lizzie
baker
in
like
manner
make
what
is
called
the
inside
trip
skimming
through
the
network
of
islands
that
line
the
coast
and
bringing
up
at
the
same
points
then
there
are
the
continually
plying
between
jacksonville
and
this
place
and
the
small
boats
that
run
weekly
to
the
ocklawaha
all
these
make
pilatka
a
busy
lively
and
important
place
with
pilatka
the
interest
of
our
finished
with
springs
magnolia
hibernia
at
all
of
which
we
touched
on
our
way
back
we
were
already
familiar
and
the
best
sight
of
all
was
the
cottage
under
the
oaks
to
which
we
gladly
returned
illustration
old

and
the

the
little
wharf
at
mandarin
is
a
tiny
abutment
into
the
great
blue
sea
of
the
john
waters
five
miles
in
width
the
opposite
shores
gleam
out
blue
in
the
vanishing
distance
and
the
small
wharf
is
built
so
far
out
that
one
feels
there
as
in
a
boat
at
sea
here
trundled
down
on
the
truck
along
a
descending
come
the
goods
which
at
this
point
await
shipment
on
some
of
the
many
steamboats
which
ply
back
and
forth
upon
the
river
and
here
are
landed
by
almost
every
steamer
goods
and
chattels

the
many
families
which
are

shadows
of

in

are
scarce
a
dozen
houses
all
told
but
far
back
for
a
radius
of
ten
or
fifteen
miles
are
scattered
farmhouses
whence
come
tributes
of
produce
to
this
point
hundreds
of
barrels
of
oranges
boxes
of
tomatoes
and
early
vegetables
grapes
peaches
and
pomegranates
here
pause
on
their
way
to
the
jacksonville
market
one
morning
as
the
professor
and
i
were
enjoying
our
morning
stroll
on
the
little
wharf
an
unusual
sight
met
our
eye
a
bale
of
cotton
long
and
large
pressed
hard
and
solid
as
iron
and
done
up
and
sewed
in
a
wholly
workmanlike
manner
that
excited
our
surprise
it
was
the
first
time
since
we
had
been
in
mandarin
a
space
of
some
four
or
five
years
that
we
had
ever
seen
a
bale
of
cotton
on
that
wharf
yet
the
whole
soil
of
east
florida
is
especially
adapted
not
only
to
the
raising
of
cotton
but
of
the
peculiar
long
staple
cotton
which
commands
the
very
highest
but
for
two
or
three
years
past
the
annual
ravages
of
the
had
been
so
discouraging
that
the
culture
of
cotton
had
been
abandoned
in
despair
whence
then
had
come
that
most
artistic
bale
of
cotton
so
well
pressed
so
trim
and
tidy
and
got
up
altogether
in
so
superior
a
style
standing
by
it
on
the
wharf
was
an
aged
negro
misshapen
and
almost
deformed
he
was
thin
and
bony
and
his
head
and
beard
were
grizzled
with
age
he
was
black
as
night
itself
and
but
for
a
glittering
intellectual
eye
he
might
have
been
taken
for
a
big
baboon
the
missing
link
of
darwin
to
him
spoke
the
professor
giving
a
punch
with
his
cane
upon
the
solid
bale
why
this
is
splendid
cotton
where
did
it
come
from
who
raised
it
raise
it
sah
me
dis
yer
boy
pointing
to
a
black
man
beside
him
we
raise
it
where
oh
out
a
piece
a
lounging
white
man
never
wanting
on
a
wharf
here
interposed
oh
this
is
old
cudjo
he
lives
up
julington
he
an
honest
old
fellow
now
we
had
heard
of
this
settlement
up
julington
some
two
or
three
years
before
a
party
of
negroes
from
south
carolina
and
georgia
had
been
induced
to
come
into
florida
and
take
up
a
tract
of
government
land
some
white
man
in
whom
they
all
put
confidence
had
undertaken
for
them
the
task
of
getting
their
respective
allotments
surveyed
and
entered
for
them
so
that
they
should
have
a
solid
basis
of
land
to
work
upon
here
then
they
settled
down
and
finding
accidentally
that
a
small
central
lot
was
not
enclosed
in
any
of
the
allotments
they
took
it
as
an
indication
that
was
to
be
their
church
and
accordingly
erected
there
a
where
they
could
hold
those
weekly
which
often
seem
with
the
negroes
to
take
the
place
of
all
other
recreations
the
neighboring
farmers
were
not
particularly
well
disposed
towards
the
little
colony
the
native
floridian
farmer
is
a
quiet
peaceable
being
not
at
all
disposed
to
infringe
the
rights
of
others
and
mainly
anxious
for
peace
and
quietness
but
they
supposed
that
a
stampede
of
negroes
from
georgia
and
carolina
meant
trouble
for
them
meant
depredations
upon
their
cattle
and
poultry
and
regarded
it
with
no
friendly
eye
yet
nevertheless
they
made
no
demonstration
against
it
under
these
circumstances
the
new
colony
had
gone
to
work
with
untiring
industry
they
had
built
and
barns
they
had
split
rails
and
fenced
in
their
land
they
had
planted
they
had
cleared
acres
of
the
and
any
one
that
ever
has
seen
what
it
is
to
clear
up
an
acre
of
will
best
appreciate
the
meaning
of
that
toil
only
those
black
men
with
sinews
of
steel
and
nerves
of
wire
men
who
grow
stronger
and
more
vigorous
under
those
burning
suns
that
wither
the
white
men
are
competent
to
the
task
but
old
cudjo
had
at
last
brought
his
land
from
the
wild
embrace
of
the
snaky
to
the
point
of
bearing
a
bale
of
cotton
like
the
one
on
the
wharf
he
had
subdued
the
savage
earth
brought
her
under
and
made
her
tributary
to
his
will
and
demonstrated
what
the
soil
of
east
florida
might
could
and
would
do
the
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
and
yet
this
morning
he
stood
by
his
cotton
drooping
and
dispossessed
the
white
man
that
had
engaged
to
take
up
land
for
these
colonists
had
done
his
work
in
such
a
slovenly
imperfect
manner
that
another
settler
a
foreigner
had
taken
up
a
tract
which
passed
right
through
old
cudjo
farm
and
taken
the
land
on
which
he
had
spent
four
years
of
hard
work
taken
his
and
barn
and
young
trees
and
the
very
piece
that
he
had
just
brought
to
bearing
that
bale
of
cotton
and
there
he
stood
by
it
mournful
and
patient
it
was
only
a
continuation
of
what
he
had
always
experienced
always
oppressed
always
robbed
and
cheated
old
cudjo
was
making
the
best
of
it
in
trying
to
ship
his
bale
of
cotton
which
was
all
that
was
left
of
four
years
toil
what
said
the
professor
to
him
are
you
the
old
man
that
has
been
turned
out
by
that
foreigner
yes
sah
he
said
his
little
black
eyes
kindling
and
quivering
from
head
to
foot
with
excitement
he
take
ebry
ebry
my
house
i
built
myself
my
fences
and
rails
i
split
myself
he
take
all
there
is
always
some
bitter
spot
in
a
great
loss
that
is
sorer
than
the
rest
those
rails
evidently
cut
cudjo
to
the
heart
the
rails
kept
coming
in
in
his
narrative
as
the
utter
and
unbearable
aggravation
of
injustice
i
split
myself
sah
rails
and
he
take
all
and
wo
he
allow
you
any
thing
no
sah
he
wo
me
he
say
along
wid
you
know
dis
yer
land
mine
i
tell
him
know
old
cudjo
but
de
lord
know
him
and
by
by
when
de
angel
gabriel
come
and
put
one
foot
on
de
sea
and
on
de
land
and
blow
de
trumpet
he
blow
once
for
old
cudjo
you
mind
now
this
was
not
merely
spoken
but
acted
the
old
black
kindled
and
stepped
off
in
pantomime
he
put
as
it
were
one
foot
on
the
sea
and
the
other
on
the
land
he
raised
his
cane
trumpetwise
to
his
mouth
it
was
all
as
vivid
as
reality
to
him
none
of
the
images
of
the
bible
are
more
frequent
favorite
and
operative
among
the
black
race
than
this
you
hear
it
over
and
over
in
every
it
is
sung
in
wild
chorus
in
many
a
spiritual
the
great
angel
gabriel
the
trumpet
the
mighty
pomp
of
a
last
judgment
has
been
the
appeal
of
thousands
of
wronged
crushed
despairing
hearts
through
ages
of
oppression
faith
in
god
justice
faith
in
a
final
triumph
of
right
over
wrong
a
practical
faith
such
had
been
the
attainment
of
this
poor
old
deformed
black
that
and
his
bale
of
cotton
were
all
he
had
to
show
for
a
life
labor
he
had
learned
two
things
in
his
work
and
faith
he
had
learned
the
power
of
practical
industry
in
things
possible
to
man
he
had
learned
the
sublimer
power
of
faith
in
god
for
things
impossible
well
of
course
we
were
indignant
enough
about
poor
old
cudjo
but
we
feared
that
the
distant
appeal
of
the
angel
and
the
last
trump
was
all
that
remained
to
him
and
to
our
lesser
faith
that
seemed
a
long
way
to
look
for
justice
but
redress
was
nearer
than
we
imagined
old
cudjo
patient
industry
and
honest
work
had
wrought
favor
among
his
white
neighbors
he
had
lived
down
the
prejudice
with
which
the
settlement
had
first
been
regarded
for
among
quiet
honest
people
like
the
floridians
it
is
quite
possible
to
live
down
prejudice
a
neighboring
justice
of
the
peace
happened
to
have
an
acquaintance
in
washington
from
this
very
district
acquainted
with
all
the
land
and
he
wrote
to
this
man
an
account
of
the
case
and
he
interested
himself
for
old
cudjo
he
went
to
the
to
investigate
the
matter
he
found
that
in
both
cases
certain
formalities
necessary
to
constitute
a
legal
entrance
had
been
omitted
and
he
fulfilled
for
old
cudjo
these
formalities
thus
settling
his
title
and
moreover
he
sent
legal
papers
by
which
the
sheriff
of
the
county
was
enabled
to
do
him
justice
and
so
old
cudjo
was
in
his
rights
the
professor
met
him
sparkling
and
jubilant
on
the
wharf
once
more
well
cudjo
angel
blew
for
you
quicker
than
you
expected
he
laughed
all
over
ye

yes
massa
then
with
his
usual
histrionic
vigor
he
acted
over
the
scene
de
sheriff
he
come

illustration
the
laborers
of
the
south
who
shall
do
the
work
for
us
is
the
inquiry
in
this
new
state
where
there
are
marshes
to
be
drained
forests
to
be
cut
down
to
be
grubbed
up
and
all
under
the
torrid
heats
of
a
tropical
sun
chinese
say
some
swedes
say
others
germans
others
but
let
us
look
at
the
facts
before
our
face
and
eyes
the
thermometer
for
these
three
days
past
has
risen
over
ninety
every
day
no
white
man
that
we
know
of
dares
stay
in
the
fields
later
than
ten
then
he
retires
under
shade
to
take
some
other
and
work
the
fine
white
sand
is
blistering
hot
one
might
fancy
that
an
egg
would
cook
as
on
mt
vesuvius
by
simply
burying
it
in
the
sand
yet
the
black
laborers
whom
we
leave
in
the
field
pursue
their
toil
if
any
thing
more
actively
more
cheerfully
than
during
the
cooler
months
the
sun
awakes
all
their
vigor
and
all
their
boundless
jollity
when
their
nooning
time
comes
they
sit
down
not
in
the
shade
but
in
some
good
hot
place
in
the
sand
and
eat
their
lunch
and
then
stretch
out
hot
and
comfortable
to
take
their
noon
siesta
with
the
full
glare
of
the
sun
upon
them
down
in
the
near
our
house
we
have
watched
old
simon
as
from
hour
to
hour
he
drove
his
wheelbarrow
heavy
with
blocks
of
muck
up
a
steep
bank
and
deposited
it
why
simon
we
say
how
you
work
so
this
hot
weather
the
question
provokes
an
explosion
of
laughter
yah
hah
ho
ho
ho
misse

be
hot
dat
so
ho
ho
ho
how
you
work
so
i
ca
even
think

such
hard
work
under
such
a
sun
dat
so
ho
ho
ladies
ca
no
dey
ca
bless
you
and
simon
trundles
off
with
his
barrow
chuckling
in
his
might
comes
up
with
another
load
throws
it
down
and
chuckles
again
a
little
laugh
goes
a
great
way
with
simon
for
a
boiling
spring
of
animal
content
is
ever
welling
up
within
one
tremendously
hot
day
we
remember
our
steamer
stopping
at
fernandina
owing
to
the
state
of
the
tide
the
wharf
was
eight
or
ten
feet
above
the
boat
and
the
plank
made
a
steep
inclined
plane
down
which
a
mountain
of
multifarious
freight
was
to
be
shipped
on
our
boat
a
gang
of
negroes
great
brawny
muscular
fellows
seemed
to
make
a
perfect
frolic
of
this
job
which
under
such
a
sun
would
have
threatened
sunstroke
to
any
white
man
how
they
ran
and
shouted
and
jabbered
and
sweated
their
shirts
through
as
one
after
another
received
on
their
shoulders
great
bags
of
or
boxes
and
bales
and
ran
down
the
steep
plane
with
them
into
the
boat
at
last
a
low
squat
giant
of
a
fellow
with
the
limbs
and
muscles
of
a
great
placed
himself
in
front
of
a
large
truck
and
made
his
fellows
pile
it
high
with
then
holding
back
with
a
prodigious
force
he
took
the
load
steadily
down
the
steep
plane
till
within
a
little
of
the
bottom
when
he
dashed
suddenly
forward
and
landed
it
half
across
the
boat
this
feat
of
gigantic
strength
he
repeated
again
and
again
running
up
each
time
apparently
as
fresh
as
if
nothing
had
happened
shouting
laughing
drinking
quarts
of
water
and
sweating
like
a
never
was
harder
work
done
in
a
more
jolly
spirit
now
when
one
sees
such
sights
as
these
one
may
be
pardoned
for
thinking
that
the
negro
is
the
natural
laborer
of
tropical
regions
he
is
immensely
strong
he
thrives
and
flourishes
physically
under
a
temperature
that
exposes
a
white
man
to
disease
and
death
the
malarial
fevers
that
bear
so
hard
on
the
white
race
have
far
less
effect
on
the
negro
it
is
rare
that
they
have
what
are
called
here
the
shakes
and
they
increase
and
multiply
and
bear
healthy
children
in
situations
where
the
white
race
deteriorate
and
grow
sickly
on
this
point
we
had
an
interesting
conversation
with
a
captain
employed
in
the
government
coast
survey
the
duties
of
this
survey
involve
much
hard
labor
exposure
to
the
fiercest
extremes
of
tropical
temperature
and
sojourning
and
travelling
in
swamps
and
lagoons
often
most
deadly
to
the
white
race
for
this
reason
he
manned
his
vessel
with
a
crew
composed
entirely
of
negroes
and
he
informed
us
that
the
result
had
been
perfectly
satisfactory
the
negro
constitution
enabled
them
to
undergo
with
less
suffering
and
danger
the
severe
exposure
and
toils
of
the
enterprise
and
the
gayety
and
good
nature
which
belonged
to
the
race
made
their
toils
seem
to
sit
lighter
upon
them
than
upon
a
given
number
of
white
men
he
had
known
them
after
a
day
of
heavy
exposure
travelling
through
mud
and
swamps
and
cutting
which
wounds
like
a
knife
to
sit
down
at
evening
and
sing
songs
and
play
on
the
banjo
laugh
and
tell
stories
in
the
very
best
of
spirits
he
furthermore
valued
them
for
their
docility
and
perfect
subjection
to
discipline
he
announced
strict
rules
forbidding
all
drunkenness
and
profanity
and
he
never
found
a
difficulty
in
enforcing
these
rules
their
obedience
and
submission
were
perfect
when
this
gentleman
was
laid
up
with
an
attack
of
fever
in
augustine
his
room
was
beset
by
anxious
negro
mammies
relations
of
his
men
bringing
fruits
flowers
and
delicacies
of
their
compounding
for
the
captain
those
who
understand
and
know
how
to
treat
the
negroes
seldom
have
reason
to
complain
of
their
ingratitude
but
it
is
said
by
northern
men
who
come
down
with
northern
habits
of
labor
that
the
negro
is
inefficient
as
a
laborer
it
is
to
be
conceded
that
the
influence
of
climate
and
constitution
and
the
past
benumbing
influences
of
slavery
do
make
the
habits
of
southern
laborers
very
different
from
the
habits
of
northern
men
accustomed
by
the
shortness
of
summer
and
the
length
of
winter
to
set
the
utmost
value
on
their
in
the
south
where
growth
goes
on
all
the
year
round
there
really
is
no
need
of
that
intense
driving
energy
and
vigilance
in
the
use
of
time
that
are
needed
in
the
short
summers
of
the
north
an
equal
amount
can
be
done
with
less
labor
but
the
northern
man
when
he
first
arrives
before
he
has
proved
the
climate
looks
with
impatient
scorn
on
what
seems
to
him
the
slow
style
in
which
both
black
and
white
move
on
it
takes
an
attack
of
malarial
fever
or
two
to
teach
him
that
he
can
not
labor
the
day
through
under
a
tropical
sun
as
he
can
in
the
mountains
of
new
hampshire
after
a
shake
or
two
of
this
kind
he
comes
to
be
thankful
if
he
can
hire
cudjo
or
pompey
to
plough
and
hoe
in
his
fields
through
the
blazing
hours
even
though
they
do
not
plough
and
hoe
with
all
the
alacrity
of
northern
farmers
it
is
also
well
understood
that
in
taking
negro
laborers
we
have
to
take
men
and
women
who
have
been
educated
under
a
system
the
very
worst
possible
for
making
good
efficient
careful
or
honest
laborers
take
any
set
of
white
men
and
put
them
for
two
or
three
generations
under
the
same
system
of
work
without
wages
forbid
them
legal
marriage
and
secure
family
ties
and
we
will
venture
to
predict
that
they
would
come
out
of
the
ordeal
a
much
worse
set
than
the
southern
laborers
are
we
have
had
in
our
own
personal
experience
pretty
large
opportunities
of
observation
immediately
after
the
war
two
young
men
hired
the
mackintosh
plantation
opposite
to
mandarin
on
the
west
bank
of
the
john
river
it
was
in
old
times
the
model
plantation
of
florida
employing
seven
hundred
negroes
raising
sugar
rice
cotton
there
was
upon
it
a
whole
village
of
comfortable
negro
houses
as
well
built
and
comfortable
as
those
of
any
of
the
white
small
farmers
around
there
was
a
planter
house
a
schoolhouse
with
chambers
for
the
accommodation
of
a
teacher
who
was
to
instruct
the
planter
children
there
were
barns
and
a
and
storehouse
a
a
milk
and
dairy
house
an
oven
and
a
kitchen
each
separate
buildings
there
were
some
two
or
three
hundred
acres
of
cleared
land
fit
for
the
raising
of
cotton
this
whole
estate
had
been
hired
by
these
young
men
on
the
principle
of
sharing
half
the
profits
with
the
owner
after
they
had
carried
it
on
one
year
some
near
relatives
became
partners
and
then
we
were
frequent
visitors
there
about
thirty
laboring
families
were
employed
upon
the
place
these
were
from
different
more
northern
states
who
had
drifted
downward
after
the
emancipation
act
to
try
the
new
luxury
of
being
free
to
choose
their
own
situation
and
seek
their
own
fortune
some
were
from
georgia
some
from
south
and
some
from
north
carolina
and
some
from
new
orleans
in
fact
the
of
slavery
washed
together
in
the
tide
of
emancipation
such
as
they
were
they
were
a
fair
specimen
of
the
southern
negro
as
slavery
had
made
and
left
him
the
system
pursued
with
them
was
not
either
patronizing
or
sentimental
the
object
was
to
put
them
at
once
on
the
ground
of
free
white
men
and
women
and
to
make
their
labor
profitable
to
their
employers
they
were
taught
the
nature
of
a
contract
and
their
agreements
with
their
employers
were
all
drawn
up
in
writing
and
explained
to
them
the
terms
were
a
certain
monthly
sum
of
money
rations
for
the
month
rent
of
cottage
and
privileges
of
milk
from
the
dairy
one
of
the
most
efficient
and
intelligent
was
appointed
to
be
foreman
of
the
plantation
and
he
performed
the
work
of
old
performed
by
a
driver
he
divided
the
hands
into
gangs
appointed
their
places
in
the
field
settled
any
difficulties
between
them
and
in
fact
was
an
overseer
of
the
detail
like
all
uneducated
people
the
negroes
are
great
conservatives
they
clung
to
the
old
ways
of
working
to
the
gang
the
driver
and
the
old
field
arrangements
even
where
one
would
have
thought
another
course
easier
and
wiser
in
the
dim
gray
of
the
morning
mose
blew
his
horn
and
all
turned
out
and
worked
their
two
or
three
hours
without
breakfast
and
then
came
back
to
their
cabins
to
have
made
and
pork
fried
and
breakfast
prepared
we
suggested
that
the
manner
of
an
early
breakfast
would
be
more
to
the
purpose
but
were
met
by
the
difficulty
nay
almost
impossibility
of
making
the
negroes
work
in
any
but
the
routine
to
which
they
had
been
accustomed
but
in
this
routine
they
worked
honestly
cheerfully
and
with
a
will
they
had
the
fruits
of
their
labors
constantly
in
hand
in
the
form
either
of
rations
or
wages
and
there
appeared
to
be
much
sober
content
therewith
on
inquiry
it
was
found
that
though
living
in
all
respectability
in
families
the
parties
were
many
of
them
not
legally
married
and
an
attempt
was
made
to
induce
them
to
enter
into
holy
orders
but
the
men
seemed
to
regard
this
as
the
imposing
of
a
yoke
beyond
what
they
could
bear
mose
said
he
had
one
wife
in
virginny
and
one
in
carliny
and
how
did
he
know
which
of
he
should
like
best
mandy
on
the
female
side
objected
that
she
could
not
be
married
yet
for
want
of
a
white
lace
veil
which
she
seemed
to
consider
essential
to
the
ceremony
the
survey
of
mandy
in
her
stuff
gown
and
boots
with
her
man
hat
on
following
the
mule
with
the
plough
brought
rather
ludicrous
emotions
in
connection
with
this
want
of
a
white
veil
nevertheless
the
legal
marriages
were
few
among
them
they
lived
faithfully
in
their
respective
family
relations
and
they
did
their
work
on
the
whole
effectively
and
cheerfully
their
only
amusement
after
working
all
day
seemed
to
be
getting
together
and
holding
singing
and
prayer
meetings
which
they
often
did
to
a
late
hour
of
the
night
we
used
to
sit
and
hear
them
after
ten
or
eleven
singing
and
praying
and
exhorting
with
the
greatest
apparent
fervor
there
were
one
or
two
of
what
are
called
preachers
among
them
men
with
a
natural
talent
for
stringing
words
together
and
with
fine
voices
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
we
once
sat
outside
when
one
of
these
meetings
was
going
on
to
hear
what
it
was
like
the
exhortation
seemed
to
consist
in
a
string
of
words
and
phrases
images
borrowed
from
scripture
scraps
of
hymns
and
now
and
then
a
morsel
that
seemed
like
a
tradition
about
the
virgin
mary
and
jesus
the
most
prominent
image
however
was
that
of
the
angel
and
the
blowing
of
the
last
trumpet
at
intervals
amid
the
flying
cloud
of
images
and
words
came
round
something
about
gabriel
and
the
last
trump
somewhat
as
follows
and
he
will
say
gabriel
blow
your
trump
take
it
cool
and
easy
cool
and
easy
gabriel
dey
all
bound
for
to
come
this
idea
of
taking
even
the
blowing
of
the
last
trump
cool
and
easy
seemed
to
be
so
like
the
general
negro
style
of
attending
to
things
that
it
struck
me
as
quite
refreshing
as
to
singing
the
most
doleful
words
with
the
most
lugubrious
melodies
seemed
to
be
in
favor
hark
from
the
tombs
a
doleful
sound
was
a
special
favorite
with
eyes
shut
and
mouth
open
they
would
pour
out
a
perfect
storm
of
melody
on
poor
old
watts
hymn
mispronouncing
every
word
till
the
old
doctor
himself
could
not
have
told
whether
they
were
singing
english
or
timbuctoo
yet
all
this
was
done
with
a
fervor
and
earnest
solemnity
that
seemed
to
show
that
found
something
in
it
whether
we
could
or
not
who
shall
say
a
good
old
mammy
we
used
to
know
found
great
refreshment
in
a
hymn
the
chorus
of
which
was
bust
the
bonds
of
dust
and
thunder
bring
salvation
from
on
high
undoubtedly
the
words
suggested
to
her
very
different
ideas
from
what
they
did
to
us
for
she
obstinately
refused
to
have
them
exchanged
for
good
english
but
when
the
enlightened
wise
liberal
and
refined
for
generations
have
found
edification
and
spiritual
profit
from
a
service
chanted
in
an
unknown
tongue
who
shall
say
that
the
poor
negroes
of
our
plantation
did
not
derive
real
spiritual
benefit
from
their
night
services
it
was
at
least
an
aspiration
a
reaching
and
longing
for
something
above
animal
and
physical
good
a
recognition
of
god
and
immortality
and
a
future
beyond
this
earth
vague
and
indefinite
though
it
were
as
to
the
women
they
were
all
of
the
class
born
and
bred
as
they
were
many
of
them
as
strong
as
men
could
plough
and
chop
and
cleave
with
the
best
and
were
held
to
be
among
the
best
but
in
all
household
affairs
they
were
as
rough
and
unskilled
as
might
be
expected
to
mix
meal
water
and
salt
into
a
and
to
fry
salt
pork
or
ham
or
chicken
was
the
extent
of
their
knowledge
of
cooking
and
as
to
sewing
it
is
a
fortunate
thing
that
the
mild
climate
requires
very
slight
covering
all
of
them
practised
rudely
cutting
fitting
and
making
of
garments
to
cover
their
children
but
we
could
see
how
hard
was
their
task
after
working
all
day
in
the
field
to
come
home
and
get
the
meals
and
then
after
that
have
the
family
sewing
to
do
in
our
view
woman
never
was
made
to
do
the
work
which
supports
the
family
and
if
she
do
it
the
family
suffers
more
for
want
of
the
mother
vitality
expended
in
work
than
it
gains
in
the
wages
she
receives
some
of
the
brightest
and
most
intelligent
negro
men
begin
to
see
this
and
to
remove
their
wives
from
but
on
the
plantation
as
we
saw
it
the
absence
of
the
mother
all
day
from
home
was
the
destruction
of
any
or
improvement
yet
with
all
this
the
poor
things
many
of
them
showed
a
most
affecting
eagerness
to
be
taught
to
read
and
write
we
carried
down
and
distributed
a
stock
of
among
them
which
they
eagerly
accepted
and
treasured
with
a
sort
of
superstitious
veneration
and
sundays
and
evenings
after
work
certain
of
them
would
appear
with
them
in
hand
and
earnestly
beg
to
be
taught
alas
we
never
felt
so
truly
what
the
loss
and
wrong
is
of
being
deprived
of
early
education
as
when
we
saw
how
hard
how
almost
hopeless
is
the
task
of
acquisition
in
mature
life
when
we
saw
the
sweat
start
upon
these
black
faces
as
our
pupils
puzzled
and
blundered
over
the
strange
cabalistic
forms
of
the
letters
we
felt
a
discouraged
pity
what
a
dreadful
piece
of
work
the
reading
of
the
english
language
is
which
of
us
would
not
be
discouraged
beginning
the
alphabet
at
forty
after
we
left
the
same
scholars
were
wont
to
surround
one
of
the
remaining
ladies
sometimes
the
evening
would
be
so
hot
and
oppressive
she
would
beg
to
be
excused
o
misse
but
two
of
us
will
fan
you
all
the
time
and
misse
could
not
but
yield
to
the
plea
one
of
the
most
dreaded
characters
on
the
place
was
the
and
cook
minnah
she
had
been
a
in
north
carolina
and
worked
at
cutting
down
trees
grubbing
land
and
mauling
rails
she
was
a
tall
lank
woman
with
a
pair
of
arms
like
and
a
tongue
that
never
hesitated
to
speak
her
mind
to
high
or
low
democracy
never
assumes
a
more
rampant
form
than
in
some
of
these
old
negresses
who
would
say
their
screed
to
the
king
on
his
throne
if
they
died
for
it
the
next
minute
accordingly
minnah
back
was
all
marked
and
scored
with
the
tyrant
answers
to
free
speech
her
old
master
was
accustomed
to
reply
to
her
unpleasant
observations
by
stretching
her
over
a
log
staking
down
her
hands
and
feet
and
flaying
her
alive
as
a
most
convincing
style
of
argument
for
all
that
minnah
was
neither
broken
nor
humbled
she
still
asserted
her
rights
as
a
human
being
to
talk
to
any
other
human
being
as
seemed
to
her
good
and
proper
and
many
an
amusing
specimen
of
this
she
gave
us
minnah
had
learned
to
do
up
gentlemen
shirts
passably
to
iron
and
to
cook
after
a
certain
fashion
to
make
butter
and
do
some
other
household
tasks
and
so
before
the
wives
of
the
gentlemen
arrived
on
the
place
she
had
been
selected
as
a
sort
of
general
housekeeper
and
manager
in
doors
and
as
we
arrived
on
the
ground
first
we
found
minnah
in
full
command
the
only
female
presence
in
the
house
it
was
at
the
close
of
a
day
in
may
corresponding
to
our
august
that
f
and
baby
and
myself
with
sundry
bales
of
furniture
and
household
stuff
arrived
at
the
place
we
dropped
down
in
a
lazy
little
which
had
lain
half
the
day
becalmed
with
the
blue
hazy
shores
on
either
side
melting
into
indefinite
distance
and
cast
anchor
far
out
in
the
stream
and
had
to
be
rowed
in
a
smaller
boat
to
the
long
wharf
that
stretched
far
out
into
the
waters
thence
in
the
thickening
twilight
we
ascended
passed
through
the
belt
of
that
overhung
the
shore
and
crossed
the
wide
fields
of
fine
white
sand
devoted
to
the
raising
of
cotton
the
planter
house
was
a
cottage
far
in
the
distance
rising
up
under
the
shelter
of
a
lofty
tuft
of
spanish
oaks
never
shall
we
forget
the
impression
of
weird
and
almost
ludicrous
dreariness
which
took
possession
of
us
as
f
and
myself
sat
down
in
the
wide
veranda
of
the
cottage
to
wait
for
the
gentlemen
who
had
gone
down
to
assist
in
landing
our
trunks
and
furniture
the
black
laborers
were
coming
up
from
the
field
and
as
one
and
another
passed
by
they
seemed
blacker
stranger
and
more
dismal
than
any
thing
we
had
ever
seen
the
women
wore
men
hats
and
boots
and
had
the
gait
and
stride
of
men
but
now
and
then
an
old
hooped
petticoat
or
some
thin
bedraggled
garment
that
had
once
been
fine
told
the
tale
of
sex
and
had
a
wofully
funny
effect
as
we
sat
waiting
minnah
loomed
up
upon
us
in
the
twilight
veranda
like
a
gaunt
libyan
sibyl
walking
round
and
round
surveying
us
with
apparent
curiosity
and
responding
to
all
our
inquiries
as
to
who
and
what
she
was
by
a
peculiarly
uncanny
chuckle
it
appeared
to
amuse
her
extremely
that
f
had
gone
off
and
left
the
pantry
locked
up
so
that
she
could
not
get
us
any
supper
we
being
faint
and
almost
famished
with
our
day
sail
the
sight
of
a
white
baby
dressed
in
delicate
white
robes
with
lace
and
embroidery
also
appeared
greatly
to
excite
her
and
she
stalked
round
and
round
with
a
curious
simmer
of
giggle
appearing
and
disappearing
at
uncertain
intervals
like
a
black
sprite
during
the
mortal
hour
and
a
half
that
it
cost
our
friends
to
land
the
goods
from
the
vessel
after
a
while
some
supper
was
got
for
us
in
a
wide
desolate
apartment
fitted
up
with
a
small
in
the
corner
never
shall
we
forget
the
experience
of
endeavoring
to
improvise
a
the
next
morning
for
breakfast
we
went
into
the
room
and
found
the
table
standing
just
as
we
had
left
it
the
night
before
not
a
dish
washed
not
a
thing
done
in
the
way
of
clearing
on
inquiry
for
minnah
she
was
gone
out
to
milking
it
appeared
that
there
were
sixteen
cows
to
be
milked
before
her
return
a
little
colored
girl
stood
ready
to
wait
on
us
with
ample
good
nature
lizzie
said
we
have
you
oh
yes
and
she
brought
it
just
as
the
corn
had
been
ground
with
the
bran
unsifted
a
sieve
lizzie
it
was
brought
a
clean
pan
lizzie
quick
all
right
said
lizzie
let
me
get
a
pail
of
water
the
water
was
to
be
drawn
from
a
deep
well
in
the
yard
that
done
lizzie
took
a
pan
went
out
the
door
produced
a
small
bit
of
rag
and
rinsed
the
pan
dashing
the
contents
upon
the
sand
lizzie
have
you
any
no
no
towels
no
do
you
always
wash
dishes
this
way
yes
well
then
wash
this
spoon
and
these
two
lizzie
and
zealous
as
the
day
is
long
bent
over
her
pail
and
slopped
and
scrubbed
with
her
bit
of
rag
now
for
a
pan
of
sour
milk
said
we
it
was
brought
with
saleratus
and
other
condiments
and
the
cake
was
made
but
on
examination
the
flues
of
the
little
were
so
choked
with
the
resinous
soot
of
the
which
had
been
used
in
it
that
it
would
scarcely
draw
at
all
and
the
baking
did
not
progress
as
in
our
nice
stuart
stove
in
our
northern
home
still
the
whole
experience
was
so
weirdly
original
that
considering
this
was
only
a
picnic
excursion
we
rather
enjoyed
it
when
we
came
to
unpack
china
and
crockery
and
carpets
bureau
and
bedsteads
and
minnah
excitement
knew
no
bounds
evidently
she
considered
these
articles
remnants
of
our
northern
home
as
the
height
of
splendor
when
our
upper
chamber
was
matted
and
furnished
with
white
curtains
and
shades
and
bed
chairs
and
minnah
came
in
to
look
and
her
delight
was
boundless
dear
me
o
lord
o
lord
she
exclaimed
turning
round
and
round
dese
yer
northern
ladies
they
hes
every
thing
and
they
does
every
thing
more
especially
was
she
taken
with
the
pictures
we
hung
on
the
walls
before
one
of
these
raphael
madonna
of
the
veil
minnah
knelt
down
in
a
kind
of
ecstatic
trance
and
thus
delivered
herself
o
good
lord
if
there
ai
de
good
man
when
he
was
a
baby
how
harmless
he
lies
there
so
innocent
and
here
we
be
we
wicked
sinners
turning
our
backs
on
him
and
going
to
the
old
boy
o
lord
o
lord
we
ought
to
be
better
than
we
be
we
sartin
ought
this
invocation
came
forth
with
streaming
tears
in
the
most
natural
way
in
the
world
and
minnah
seemed
for
the
time
being
perfectly
subdued
it
is
only
one
of
many
instances
we
have
seen
of
the
overpowering
influence
of
works
of
art
on
the
impressible
nervous
system
of
the
negro
but
it
is
one
thing
to
have
an
amusing
and
picturesque
specimen
of
a
human
being
as
minnah
certainly
was
and
another
to
make
one
useful
in
the
traces
of
domestic
life
as
the
first
white
ladies
upon
the
ground
f
and
myself
had
the
task
of
organizing
this
barbaric
household
and
of
bringing
it
into
the
forms
of
civilized
life
we
commenced
with
the
washing
before
the
time
of
our
coming
it
had
been
customary
for
the
gentlemen
to
give
their
washing
into
the
hands
of
minnah
or
judy
to
be
done
at
such
times
and
in
such
form
and
manner
as
best
suited
them
the
manner
which
suit
them
best
was
to
put
all
the
articles
to
soak
indefinitely
in
soapsuds
till
such
time
as
to
them
seemed
good
on
being
pressed
for
some
particular
article
and
roundly
scolded
by
any
of
the
proprietors
they
would
get
up
a
shirt
a
pair
of
drawers
a
collar
or
two
with
abundant
promises
for
the
rest
when
they
had
time
the
helpless
male
individuals
of
the
establishments
had
no
refuge
from
the
feminine
ruses
and
expedients
and
the
fifty
incontrovertible
reasons
which
were
always
on
hand
to
prove
to
them
that
things
could
be
done
no
other
way
than
just
as
they
were
done
and
in
fact
found
it
easier
to
get
their
washing
back
again
by
blandishments
than
by
bullying
we
ladies
announced
a
regular
and
endeavored
to
explain
it
to
our
kitchen
cabinet
our
staff
consisting
of
minnah
and
judy
detailed
for
judy
was
a
fat
lazy
crafty
negress
the
florida
wife
of
the
foreman
mose
and
devoted
to
his
will
and
pleasure
in
hopes
to
supplant
the
virginny
and
carliny
wives
judy
said
yes
to
every
thing
we
proposed
but
minnah
was
kinky
and
argumentative
but
finally
when
we
represented
to
her
that
the
proposed
arrangement
was
customary
in
good
northern
society
she
gave
her
assent
we
first
proceeded
to
make
a
barrel
of
soda
in
a
great
iron
which
stood
out
under
the
and
which
had
formerly
been
used
for
evaporating
sugar
minnah
took
the
greatest
interest
in
the
operation
and
when
the
soap
was
finished
took
the
boiling
liquid
in
pailfuls
setting
them
on
the
top
of
her
head
and
marching
off
to
the
barrel
in
the
house
with
them
without
ever
lifting
a
finger
we
screamed
after
her
in
horror
minnah
minnah
if
that
should
fall
it
would
kill
you
a
laugh
of
barbaric
exultation
was
the
only
response
as
she
actually
persisted
in
carrying
pailful
after
pailful
of
scalding
soap
on
her
head
till
all
was
disposed
of
the
next
day
the
washing
was
all
brought
out
under
the
trees
and
sorted
f
and
myself
presiding
and
soon
minnah
and
judy
were
briskly
engaged
at
their
respective
tubs
for
half
an
hour
all
went
merry
as
a
judy
was
about
half
through
her
first
tubful
when
mose
came
back
from
his
morning
turn
in
the
fields
and
summoned
her
to
come
home
and
get
his
breakfast
with
judy
very
leisurely
and
promiscuous
habits
of
doing
business
this
took
her
away
for
half
the
forenoon
meanwhile
minnah
murmured
excessively
at
being
left
alone
and
more
especially
at
the
continuous
nature
of
the
task
such
a
heap
of
clothes
to
be
washed
in
one
it
was
a
mountain
of
labor
in
minnah
imagination
and
it
took
all
our
eloquence
and
our
constant
presence
to
keep
her
in
good
humor
we
kept
at
minnah
as
the
only
means
of
keeping
her
at
her
work
but
after
all
it
was
no
bad
picnic
to
spend
a
day
in
the
open
air
in
the
golden
of
florida
the
birds
were
singing
from
every
covert
the
air
was
perfectly
intoxicating
in
its
dreamy
softness
and
so
we
spread
a
camp
for
the
baby
who
was
surrounded
by
a
retinue
of
little
giggling
adoring
negroes
and
gave
ourselves
up
to
the
amusement
of
the
scene
our
encampment
was
under
the
broad
leaves
of
a
group
of
and
we
hung
our
clothes
to
dry
on
the
sharp
thorns
of
a
gigantic
clump
of
yucca
gloriosa
which
made
an
admirable
by
night
with
chuckling
admiration
minnah
surveyed
a
great
basketful
of
clean
clothes
all
done
in
one
day
the
next
day
came
the
lesson
on
ironing
and
the
only
means
of
securing
minnah
and
judy
to
constant
work
at
the
was
the
exercise
of
our
own
individual
powers
of
entertainment
and
conversation
we
had
our
own
table
and
ironed
with
them
and
all
went
well
till
judy
remembered
she
had
preparations
for
mose
dinner
and
deserted
minnah
kept
up
some
time
longer
till
finally
when
we
went
in
the
next
room
on
an
errand
she
improved
the
opportunity
to
desert
on
returning
we
saw
minnah
place
vacant
a
shirt
lying
drying
on
the
table
searching
and
calling
we
at
last
discovered
her
far
in
the
distance
smoking
her
pipe
and
lolling
tranquilly
over
the
fence
of
a
small
enclosure
where
were
sixteen
calves
shut
up
together
so
that
maternal
longings
might
bring
the
cow
mothers
home
to
them
at
night
why
minnah
what
are
you
doing
we
said
as
we
came
up
breathless
laws
missis
i
wanted
to
feed
my
calves
i
jest
happened
to
think
o
and
forthwith
she
turned
started
to
the
barn
and
came
back
with
a
perfect
on
her
head
then
crossing
the
fence
into
the
enclosure
she
proceeded
to
make
division
of
the
same
among
the
calves
who
tumultuously
surrounded
her
she
patted
one
and
cuffed
another
and
labored
in
a
most
maternal
style
to
make
them
share
their
commons
equally
laughing
in
full
content
of
heart
and
appearing
to
have
forgotten
her
and
all
about
it
it
was
in
vain
to
talk
she
was
tired
ironing
did
anybody
ever
hear
of
doing
up
all
one
things
in
a
day
besides
she
wanted
to
see
her
calves
she
felt
just
like
it
and
minnah
planted
her
elbows
on
the
fence
and
gazed
and
smoked
and
laughed
and
talked
to
her
calves
till
we
were
quite
provoked
yet
we
could
not
help
laughing
in
fact
long
before
that
day
was
done
we
were
out
of
breath
used
up
and
exhausted
with
the
strain
of
getting
the
work
out
of
minnah
it
was
the
more
tantalizing
as
she
do
with
a
fair
amount
of
skill
any
thing
she
pleased
and
could
easily
have
done
the
whole
in
a
day
had
she
chosen
it
is
true
she
was
droll
enough
in
a
literary
and
artistic
view
to
make
one
fortune
in
a
magazine
or
story
but
when
one
had
a
house
to
manage
a
practical
humorist
is
less
in
point
than
in
some
other
places
the
fact
was
minnah
like
all
other
women
bred
to
the
fields
abominated
housework
like
a
man
she
could
do
here
and
there
and
by
fits
and
starts
and
snatches
but
to
go
on
in
any
thing
like
a
regular
domestic
routine
was
simply
disgusting
in
her
eyes
so
after
a
short
period
of
struggle
it
was
agreed
that
minnah
was
to
go
back
to
where
she
was
one
of
the
most
valuable
hands
and
a
trained
was
hired
from
jacksonville
minnah
returned
to
the
field
with
enthusiasm
we
heard
her
swinging
her
long
arms
and
shouting
to
her
gang
come
on
den
boys
and
gals
for
the
fields
i
was
born
i
was
raised
i
was
fairly
begot
in
de
fields
and
i
do
want
none
o
your
housework
in
time
we
obtained
a
cook
from
jacksonville
trained
accomplished
neat
who
made
beautiful
bread
biscuit
and
rolls
and
was
a
comfort
to
our
souls
but
this
phoenix
was
soon
called
for
by
the
wants
of
the
time
and
was
worth
more
than
we
could
give
and
went
from
us
to
enjoy
forty
dollars
per
month
as
cook
in
a
hotel
such
has
been
the
good
fortune
of
all
the
since
emancipation
they
command
their
own
price
the
untrained
plantation
hands
and
their
children
are
and
will
be
just
what
may
make
them
the
education
which
comes
to
them
from
the
state
from
being
freemen
and
voters
able
to
make
contracts
choose
locations
and
pursue
their
own
course
like
other
men
is
a
great
deal
and
it
is
operating
constantly
and
efficaciously
we
give
the
judgment
of
a
practical
farmer
accustomed
to
hire
laborers
at
the
north
and
the
south
and
as
a
result
of
five
years
experiment
on
this
subject
he
says
that
the
negro
laborer
looked
is
as
good
as
any
that
can
be
hired
at
the
north
in
some
respects
they
are
better
as
a
class
they
are
more
obedient
better
natured
more
joyous
and
easily
satisfied
the
question
as
to
whether
on
the
whole
the
negroes
are
valuable
members
of
society
and
increasing
the
material
wealth
of
the
state
is
best
answered
by
the
returns
of
the
freedman
savings
and
trust
company
an
institution
under
the
patronage
of
government
the
report
of
this
institution
for
the
year
is
before
us
and
from
this
it
appears
that
negro
laborers
in
the
different
southern
states
have
deposited
with
this
trust
company
this
year
the
sum
of
million
two
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
four
hundred
and
dollars
the
report
also
shows
that
year
by
year
the
amount
deposited
has
increased
thus
in
it
was
only
in
it
was
three
million
odd
in
it
was
seven
million
and
odd
in
twelve
million
and
odd
in
nineteen
million
and
odd
these
results
are
conclusive
to
the
fact
that
as
a
body
the
southern
laborers
are
a
thrifty
industrious
advancing
set
and
such
as
they
are
proved
by
the
large
evidence
of
these
figures
such
we
have
observed
them
in
our
more
limited
experience
our
negro
laborers
with
all
the
inevitable
defects
of
imperfect
training
ignorance
and
the
negligent
habits
induced
by
slavery
have
still
been
as
a
whole
satisfactory
laborers
they
keep
their
contracts
do
their
work
and
save
their
earnings
we
could
point
to
more
than
one
black
family
about
us
steadily
growing
up
to
competence
by
industry
and
saving
all
that
is
wanted
to
supply
the
south
with
a
set
of
the
most
desirable
skilled
laborers
is
simply
education
the
negro
children
are
bright
they
can
be
taught
any
thing
and
if
the
whites
who
can
not
bear
tropical
suns
and
fierce
extremes
neglect
to
educate
a
docile
race
who
both
can
and
will
bear
it
for
them
they
throw
away
their
best
chance
of
success
in
a
most
foolish
manner
no
community
that
properly
and
carefully
educates
the
negro
children
now
growing
up
need
complain
of
having
an
idle
thriftless
dishonest
population
about
them
common
schools
ought
to
prevent
that
the
teaching
in
the
common
schools
ought
to
be
largely
industrial
and
do
what
it
can
to
prepare
the
children
to
get
a
living
by
doing
something
well
practical
sewing
cutting
and
fitting
for
girls
and
the
general
principles
of
agriculture
for
boys
might
be
taught
with
advantage
the
negroes
are
largely
accused
of
being
thievish
and
dishonest
we
should
expect
that
they
would
be
so
we
should
imagine
that
to
labor
without
wages
for
generations
in
a
state
of
childish
dependence
would
so
confuse
every
idea
of
right
and
wrong
that
the
negro
would
be
a
hopeless
thief
our
own
experience
however
is
due
in
justice
to
those
we
have
known
on
the
first
plantation
as
we
have
said
were
about
thirty
families
from
all
the
different
southern
states
it
might
be
supposed
that
they
were
a
fair
sample
now
as
to
facts
it
was
the
habit
of
the
family
to
go
to
bed
nights
and
leave
the
house
doors
unlocked
and
often
standing
wide
open
the
keys
that
locked
the
provisions
hung
up
in
a
very
accessible
place
and
yet
no
robbery
was
ever
committed
we
used
to
set
the
over
night
and
leave
it
with
all
the
silver
upon
it
yet
lost
nothing
in
our
own
apartment
we
put
our
rings
and
pins
on
our
as
had
been
our
habit
we
had
bits
of
bright
calico
and
ribbons
and
other
attractive
articles
lying
about
and
the
girl
that
did
the
was
usually
followed
by
a
tribe
of
little
curious
observing
negroes
and
yet
we
never
missed
so
much
as
a
shred
of
calico
neither
was
this
because
they
did
not
want
them
for
the
gift
of
a
strip
of
calico
or
ribbon
would
throw
them
into
raptures
it
was
simply
that
they
did
not
steal
again
nothing
is
more
common
when
we
visit
at
the
north
than
to
have
the
complaint
made
that
fruit
is
stolen
out
of
gardens
we
have
had
people
tell
us
that
the
vexation
of
having
fruit
carried
off
was
so
great
that
it
took
away
all
the
pleasure
of
a
garden
now
no
fruit
is
more
beautiful
more
tempting
than
the
orange
we
live
in
an
surrounded
by
negroes
and
yet
never
have
any
trouble
of
this
kind
we
have
often
seen
bags
of
fine
oranges
lying
all
night
under
the
trees
and
yet
never
have
we
met
with
any
perceptible
loss
certainly
it
is
due
to
the
negroes
that
we
have
known
to
say
that
they
are
above
the
average
of
many
in
the
lower
classes
at
the
north
for
honesty
we
have
spoken
now
for
the
average
negro
what
we
have
said
is
by
no
means
the
best
that
can
with
truth
be
said
of
the
finer
specimens
among
them
we
know
some
whose
dignity
of
character
delicacy
good
principle
and
generosity
are
admirable
and
more
to
be
admired
because
these
fine
traits
have
come
up
under
the
most
adverse
circumstances
in
leaving
this
subject
we
have
only
to
repeat
our
conviction
that
the
prosperity
of
the
more
southern
states
must
depend
in
a
large
degree
on
the
right
treatment
and
education
of
the
negro
population
