impersonation
by

first
published
the
great
impersonation
chapter
i
the
trouble
from
which
great
events
were
to
come
began
when
everard
dominey
who
had
been
fighting
his
way
through
the
scrub
for
the
last
three
quarters
of
an
hour
towards
those
thin
spiral
wisps
of
smoke
urged
his
pony
to
a
last
despairing
effort
and
came
crashing
through
the
great
oleander
shrub
to
pitch
forward
on
his
head
in
the
little
clearing
it
developed
the
next
morning
when
he
found
himself
for
the
first
time
for
many
months
on
the
truckle
bed
between
linen
sheets
with
a
cool
roof
between
him
and
the
relentless
sun
he
raised
himself
a
little
in
the
bed
where
the
mischief
am
i
he
demanded
a
black
boy
seated
in
the
entrance
of
the
banda
rose
to
his
feet
mumbled
something
and
disappeared
in
a
few
moments
the
tall
slim
figure
of
a
european
in
spotless
white
riding
clothes
stooped
down
and
came
over
to
dominey
side
you
are
better
he
enquired
politely
yes
i
am
was
the
somewhat
brusque
rejoinder
where
the
mischief
am
i
and
who
are
you
the
newcomer
manner
stiffened
he
was
a
person
of
dignified
carriage
and
his
tone
conveyed
some
measure
of
rebuke
you
are
within
half
a
mile
of
the
iriwarri
river
if
you
know
where
that
is
he
replied
about
miles
southeast
of
the
darawaga
the
devil
then
i
am
in
german
east
africa
without
a
and
you
are
german
i
have
that
dominey
whistled
softly
awfully
sorry
to
have
intruded
he
said
i
left
marlinstein
two
and
a
half
months
ago
with
twenty
boys
and
plenty
of
stores
we
were
doing
a
big
trek
after
lions
i
took
some
new
askaris
in
and
they
made
trouble
looted
the
stores
one
night
and
there
was
the
devil
to
pay
i
was
obliged
to
shoot
one
or
two
and
the
rest
deserted
they
took
my
compass
damn
them
and
i
nearly
a
hundred
miles
out
of
my
bearings
you
could
give
me
a
drink
could
you
with
pleasure
if
the
doctor
approves
was
the
courteous
answer
here
jan
the
boy
sprang
up
listened
to
a
word
or
two
of
brief
command
in
his
own
language
and
disappeared
through
the
hanging
grass
which
led
into
another
hut
the
two
men
exchanged
glances
of
rather
more
than
ordinary
interest
then
dominey
laughed
i
know
what
you
thinking
he
said
it
gave
me
quite
a
start
when
you
came
in
we
devilishly
alike
are
we
there
is
a
very
strong
likeness
between
us
the
other
admitted
dominey
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
studied
his
host
the
likeness
was
clear
enough
although
the
advantage
was
all
in
favour
of
the
man
who
stood
by
the
side
of
the
camp
bedstead
with
folded
arms
everard
dominey
for
the
first
years
of
his
life
had
lived
as
an
ordinary
young
englishman
of
his
position
eton
oxford
a
few
years
in
the
army
a
few
years
about
town
during
which
he
had
succeeded
in
making
a
still
more
hopeless
muddle
of
his
already
encumbered
estates
a
few
months
of
tragedy
and
then
a
blank
afterwards
ten
years
at
first
in
the
cities
then
in
the
dark
places
of
africa
years
of
which
no
man
knew
anything
the
everard
dominey
of
ten
years
ago
had
been
without
a
doubt
the
finely
shaped
features
remained
but
the
eyes
had
lost
their
lustre
his
figure
its
elasticity
his
mouth
its
firmness
he
had
the
look
of
a
man
run
prematurely
to
seed
wasted
by
fevers
and
dissipation
not
so
his
present
companion
his
features
were
as
finely
shaped
cast
in
an
even
stronger
though
similar
mould
his
eyes
were
bright
and
full
of
fire
his
mouth
and
chin
firm
bespeaking
a
man
of
deeds
his
tall
figure
lithe
and
supple
he
had
the
air
of
being
in
perfect
health
in
perfect
mental
and
physical
condition
a
man
who
lived
with
dignity
and
some
measure
of
content
notwithstanding
the
slight
gravity
of
his
expression
yes
the
englishman
muttered
there
no
doubt
about
the
likeness
though
i
suppose
i
should
look
more
like
you
than
i
do
if
i
taken
care
of
myself
but
i
have
that
the
devil
of
it
i
gone
the
other
way
tried
to
chuck
my
life
away
and
pretty
nearly
succeeded
the
dried
grasses
were
thrust
on
one
side
and
the
doctor
entered
a
little
round
man
also
clad
in
immaculate
white
with
hair
and
thick
spectacles
his
countryman
pointed
towards
the
bed
will
you
examine
our
patient
herr
doctor
and
prescribe
for
him
what
is
necessary
he
has
asked
for
drink
let
him
have
wine
or
whatever
is
good
for
him
if
he
is
well
enough
he
will
join
our
evening
meal
i
present
my
excuses
i
have
a
despatch
to
the
man
on
the
couch
turned
his
head
and
watched
the
departing
figure
with
a
shade
of
envy
in
his
eyes
what
is
my
preserver
name
he
asked
the
doctor
the
latter
looked
as
though
the
questions
were
irreverent
it
is
his
excellency
the
baron
leopold
von
all
that
dominey
muttered
is
he
the
governor
or
something
of
that
sort
he
is
military
commandant
of
the
colony
the
doctor
replied
he
has
also
a
special
mission
damned
fellow
for
a
german
dominey
remarked
with
unthinking
insolence
the
doctor
was
unmoved
he
was
feeling
his
patient
pulse
he
concluded
his
examination
a
few
minutes
later
you
have
drunk
much
whisky
lately
so
he
asked
i
do
know
what
the
devil
it
got
to
do
with
you
was
the
curt
reply
but
i
drink
whisky
whenever
i
can
get
it
who
would
in
this
pestilential
climate
the
doctor
shook
his
head
the
climate
is
good
as
he
is
treated
he
declared
his
excellency
drinks
nothing
but
light
wine
and
seltzer
water
he
has
been
here
for
five
years
not
only
here
but
in
the
swamps
and
he
has
not
been
ill
one
well
i
have
been
at
death
door
a
dozen
times
the
englishman
rejoined
a
little
recklessly
and
i
do
much
mind
when
i
hand
in
my
checks
but
until
that
time
comes
i
shall
drink
whisky
whenever
i
can
get
the
cook
is
preparing
you
some
luncheon
the
doctor
announced
and
it
will
do
you
good
to
eat
i
can
not
give
you
whisky
at
this
moment
but
you
can
have
some
hock
and
seltzer
with
bay
send
it
along
was
the
enthusiastic
reply
what
a
constitution
i
must
have
doctor
the
smell
of
that
cooking
outside
is
making
me
your
constitution
is
still
sound
if
you
would
only
respect
it
was
the
comforting
assurance
anything
been
heard
of
the
rest
of
my
party
dominey
enquired
some
bodies
of
askaris
have
been
washed
up
from
the
river
the
doctor
informed
him
and
two
of
your
ponies
have
been
eaten
by
lions
you
will
excuse
i
have
the
wounds
of
a
native
to
dress
who
was
bitten
last
night
by
a
the
traveller
left
alone
lay
still
in
the
hut
and
his
thoughts
wandered
backwards
he
looked
out
over
the
bare
scrubby
stretch
of
land
which
had
been
cleared
for
this
encampment
to
the
mass
of
bush
and
flowering
shrubs
beyond
mysterious
and
impenetrable
save
for
that
rough
elephant
track
along
which
he
had
travelled
to
the
river
blue
as
the
sky
above
and
to
the
mountains
fading
into
mist
beyond
the
face
of
his
host
had
carried
him
back
into
the
past
puzzled
reminiscence
tugged
at
the
strings
of
memory
it
came
to
him
later
on
at
dinner
time
when
they
three
the
commandant
the
doctor
and
himself
sat
at
a
little
table
arranged
just
outside
the
hut
that
they
might
catch
the
faint
breeze
from
the
mountains
herald
of
the
darkness
native
servants
beat
the
air
around
them
with
bamboo
fans
to
keep
off
the
insects
and
the
air
was
faint
almost
to
noxiousness
with
the
perfume
of
some
sickly
exotic
shrub
why
you
devinter
he
exclaimed
suddenly
sigismund
devinter
you
were
at
eton
with
me
horrock
house
in
the
and
magdalen
afterwards
number
five
in
the
and
why
the
devil
did
the
doctor
here
tell
me
that
your
name
was
von
ragastein
because
it
happens
to
be
the
truth
was
the
somewhat
measured
reply
devinter
is
my
family
name
and
the
one
by
which
i
was
known
when
in
england
when
i
succeeded
to
the
barony
and
estates
at
my
uncle
death
however
i
was
compelled
to
also
take
the
well
it
a
small
world
dominey
exclaimed
what
brought
you
out
here
really
lions
or
elephants
you
mean
to
say
that
you
taken
up
this
sort
of
political
business
just
for
its
own
sake
not
for
sport
entirely
so
i
do
not
use
a
sporting
rifle
once
a
month
except
for
necessity
i
came
to
africa
for
different
dominey
drank
deep
of
his
hock
and
seltzer
and
leaned
back
watching
the
fireflies
rise
above
the
grass
above
the
stumpy
clumps
of
shrub
and
hang
like
miniature
stars
in
the
clear
violet
air
what
a
world
he
soliloquised
siggy
devinter
baron
von
ragastein
out
here
slaving
for
god
knows
what
drilling
niggers
to
fight
god
knows
whom
a
political
machine
i
suppose
future
of
german
africa
eh
you
were
always
proud
of
your
country
my
country
is
a
country
to
be
proud
of
was
the
solemn
reply
well
you
in
earnest
anyhow
dominey
continued
in
earnest
about
something
and
i
well
it
finished
with
me
it
would
have
been
finished
last
night
if
i
had
seen
the
smoke
from
your
fires
and
i
do
much
care
that
the
trouble
i
go
blundering
on
i
suppose
the
end
will
come
somehow
sometime
can
i
have
some
rum
or
whisky
devinter
i
mean
von
ragastein
your
excellency
or
whatever
i
ought
to
say
you
see
those
wreaths
of
mist
down
by
the
river
they
mean
malaria
for
me
unless
i
have
i
have
something
better
than
either
von
ragastein
replied
you
shall
give
me
your
opinion
of
the
orderly
who
stood
behind
his
master
chair
received
a
whispered
order
disappeared
into
the
commissariat
hut
and
came
back
presently
with
a
bottle
at
the
sight
of
which
the
englishman
gasped
napoleon
he
exclaimed
just
a
few
bottles
i
had
sent
to
me
his
host
explained
i
am
delighted
to
offer
it
to
some
one
who
will
appreciate
by
jove
there
no
mistake
about
that
dominey
declared
rolling
it
around
in
his
glass
what
a
world
i
had
eaten
for
thirty
hours
when
i
rolled
up
here
last
night
and
drunk
nothing
but
filthy
water
for
days
fricassee
of
chicken
white
bread
cabinet
hock
and
napoleon
brandy
and
again
well
who
knows
when
do
you
move
on
von
ragastein
not
for
several
what
the
mischief
do
you
find
to
do
so
far
from
headquarters
if
you
do
shoot
lions
or
elephants
his
guest
asked
curiously
if
you
really
wish
to
know
von
ragastein
replied
i
am
annoying
your
political
agents
immensely
by
moving
from
place
to
place
collecting
natives
for
but
what
do
you
want
to
drill
them
for
dominey
persisted
i
heard
some
time
ago
that
you
have
four
times
as
many
natives
under
arms
as
we
have
you
do
want
an
army
here
you
not
likely
to
quarrel
with
us
or
the
it
is
our
custom
von
ragastein
declared
a
little
didactically
in
germany
and
wherever
we
germans
go
to
be
prepared
not
only
for
what
is
likely
to
happen
but
for
what
might
possibly
a
war
in
my
younger
days
when
i
was
in
the
army
dominey
mused
might
have
made
a
man
of
surely
you
had
your
chance
out
here
dominey
shook
his
head
my
battalion
never
left
the
country
he
said
we
were
shut
up
in
ireland
all
the
time
that
was
the
reason
i
chucked
the
army
when
i
was
really
only
a
later
on
they
dragged
their
chairs
a
little
farther
out
into
the
darkness
smoking
cigars
and
drinking
some
rather
wonderful
coffee
the
doctor
had
gone
off
to
see
a
patient
and
von
ragastein
was
thoughtful
their
guest
on
the
other
hand
continued
to
be
reminiscently
discursive
our
meeting
he
observed
lazily
stretching
out
his
hand
for
his
glass
should
be
full
of
interest
to
the
psychologist
here
we
are
brought
together
by
some
miraculous
chance
to
spend
one
night
of
our
lives
in
an
african
jungle
two
human
beings
of
the
same
age
brought
up
together
thousands
of
miles
away
jogging
on
towards
the
eternal
blackness
along
lines
as
far
apart
as
the
mind
can
your
eyes
are
fixed
von
ragastein
murmured
upon
that
very
blackness
behind
which
the
sun
will
rise
at
dawn
you
will
see
it
come
up
from
behind
the
mountains
in
that
precise
spot
like
a
new
and
blazing
do
put
me
off
with
allegories
his
companion
objected
petulantly
the
eternal
blackness
exists
surely
enough
even
if
my
metaphor
is
faulty
i
am
disposed
to
be
philosophical
let
me
ramble
on
here
am
i
an
idler
in
my
boyhood
a
harmless
in
my
youth
till
i
ran
up
against
tragedy
and
since
then
a
drifter
a
drifter
with
a
slowly
growing
vice
lolling
through
life
with
no
definite
purpose
with
no
definite
hope
or
wish
except
he
went
on
a
little
drowsily
that
i
think
i
like
to
be
buried
somewhere
near
the
base
of
those
mountains
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
from
behind
which
you
say
the
sun
comes
up
every
morning
like
a
world
on
you
talk
foolishly
von
ragastein
protested
if
there
has
been
tragedy
in
your
life
you
have
time
to
get
over
it
you
are
not
yet
forty
years
then
i
turn
and
consider
you
dominey
continued
ignoring
altogether
his
friend
remark
you
are
only
my
age
and
you
look
ten
years
younger
your
muscles
are
hard
your
eyes
are
as
bright
as
they
were
in
your
school
days
you
carry
yourself
like
a
man
with
a
purpose
you
rise
at
five
every
morning
the
doctor
tells
me
and
you
return
here
worn
out
at
dusk
you
spend
every
moment
of
your
time
drilling
those
filthy
blacks
when
you
are
not
doing
that
you
are
prospecting
supervising
reports
home
trying
to
make
the
best
of
your
few
millions
of
acres
of
fever
swamps
the
doctor
worships
you
but
who
else
knows
what
do
you
do
it
for
my
friend
because
it
is
my
duty
was
the
calm
reply
duty
but
why
ca
you
do
your
duty
in
your
own
country
and
live
a
man
life
and
hold
the
hands
of
white
men
and
look
into
the
eyes
of
white
women
i
go
where
i
am
needed
most
von
ragastein
answered
i
do
not
enjoy
drilling
natives
i
do
not
enjoy
passing
the
years
as
an
outcast
from
the
ordinary
joys
of
human
life
but
i
follow
my
and
i
my
dominey
laughed
mockingly
the
whole
thing
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
you
may
be
a
dull
dog
you
always
were
on
the
serious
side
but
you
a
man
of
principle
i
a
the
difference
between
us
von
ragastein
pronounced
is
something
which
is
inculcated
into
the
youth
of
our
country
and
which
is
not
inculcated
into
yours
in
england
with
a
little
money
a
little
birth
your
young
men
expect
to
find
the
world
a
playground
for
sport
a
garden
for
loves
the
mightiest
german
noble
who
ever
lived
has
his
work
to
do
it
is
work
which
makes
fibre
which
gives
balance
to
dominey
sighed
his
cigar
dearly
prized
though
it
had
been
was
cold
between
his
fingers
in
that
perfumed
darkness
illuminated
only
by
the
faint
gleam
of
the
shaded
lamp
behind
his
face
seemed
suddenly
white
and
old
his
host
leaned
towards
him
and
spoke
for
the
first
time
in
the
kindlier
tones
of
their
youth
you
hinted
at
tragedy
my
friend
you
are
not
alone
tragedy
also
has
entered
my
life
perhaps
if
things
had
been
otherwise
i
should
have
found
work
in
more
joyous
places
but
sorrow
came
to
me
and
i
am
a
quick
flash
of
sympathy
lit
up
dominey
face
we
met
trouble
in
a
different
fashion
he
groaned
chapter
ii
dominey
slept
till
late
the
following
morning
and
when
he
woke
at
last
from
a
long
dreamless
slumber
he
was
conscious
of
a
curious
quietness
in
the
camp
the
doctor
who
came
in
to
see
him
explained
it
immediately
after
his
morning
greeting
his
excellency
he
announced
has
received
important
despatches
from
home
he
has
gone
to
meet
an
envoy
from
he
will
be
away
for
three
days
he
desired
that
you
would
remain
his
guest
until
his
very
good
of
him
dominey
murmured
is
there
any
european
news
i
do
not
know
was
the
stolid
reply
his
excellency
desired
me
to
inform
you
that
if
you
cared
for
a
short
trip
along
the
banks
of
the
river
southward
there
are
a
dozen
boys
left
and
some
ponies
there
are
plenty
of
lion
and
rhino
may
be
met
with
at
one
or
two
places
which
the
natives
know
dominey
bathed
and
dressed
sipped
his
excellent
coffee
and
lounged
about
the
place
in
uncertain
mood
he
unburdened
himself
to
the
doctor
as
they
drank
tea
together
late
in
the
afternoon
i
am
not
in
the
least
keen
on
hunting
he
confessed
and
i
feel
like
a
horrible
sponge
but
all
the
same
i
have
a
queer
sort
of
feeling
that
i
like
to
see
von
ragastein
again
your
silent
chief
rather
fascinates
me
herr
doctor
he
is
a
man
he
has
something
which
i
have
he
is
a
great
man
the
doctor
declared
enthusiastically
what
he
sets
his
mind
to
do
he
i
suppose
i
might
have
been
like
that
dominey
sighed
if
i
had
had
an
incentive
have
you
noticed
the
likeness
between
us
herr
doctor
the
latter
nodded
i
noticed
it
from
the
first
moment
of
your
arrival
he
assented
you
are
very
much
alike
yet
very
different
the
resemblance
must
have
been
still
more
remarkable
in
your
youth
time
has
dealt
with
your
features
according
to
your
well
you
need
rub
it
in
dominey
protested
irritably
i
am
rubbing
nothing
in
the
doctor
replied
with
unruffled
calm
i
speak
the
truth
if
you
had
been
possessed
of
the
same
moral
stamina
as
his
excellency
you
might
have
preserved
your
health
and
the
things
that
count
you
might
have
been
as
useful
to
your
country
as
he
is
to
i
suppose
i
am
pretty
rocky
your
constitution
has
been
abused
you
still
however
have
much
vitality
if
you
cared
to
exercise
for
a
few
months
you
would
be
a
different
you
must
excuse
i
have
dominey
spent
three
restless
days
even
the
sight
of
a
herd
of
elephants
in
the
river
and
that
strange
fierce
chorus
of
night
sounds
as
beasts
of
prey
crept
noiselessly
around
the
camp
failed
to
move
him
for
the
moment
his
love
of
sport
his
last
hold
upon
the
world
of
real
things
seemed
dead
what
did
it
matter
the
killing
of
an
animal
more
or
less
his
mind
was
fixed
uneasily
upon
the
past
searching
always
for
something
which
he
failed
to
discover
at
dawn
he
watched
for
that
strangely
wonderful
transforming
birth
of
the
day
and
at
night
he
sat
outside
the
banda
waiting
till
the
mountains
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
had
lost
shape
and
faded
into
the
violet
darkness
his
conversation
with
von
ragastein
had
unsettled
him
without
knowing
definitely
why
he
wanted
him
back
again
memories
that
had
long
since
ceased
to
torture
were
finding
their
way
once
more
into
his
brain
on
the
first
day
he
had
striven
to
rid
himself
of
them
in
the
usual
fashion
doctor
you
got
some
whisky
have
you
he
asked
the
doctor
nodded
there
is
a
case
somewhere
to
be
found
he
admitted
his
excellency
told
me
that
i
was
to
refuse
you
nothing
but
he
advises
you
to
drink
only
the
white
wine
until
his
he
really
left
that
message
precisely
as
i
have
delivered
the
desire
for
whisky
passed
came
again
but
was
beaten
back
returned
in
the
night
so
that
he
sat
up
with
the
sweat
pouring
down
his
face
and
his
tongue
parched
he
drank
lithia
water
instead
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
von
ragastein
rode
into
the
camp
his
clothes
were
torn
and
drenched
with
the
black
mud
of
the
swamps
dust
and
dirt
were
thick
upon
his
face
his
pony
almost
collapsed
as
he
swung
himself
off
nevertheless
he
paused
to
greet
his
guest
with
punctilious
courtesy
and
there
was
a
gleam
of
real
satisfaction
in
his
eyes
as
the
two
men
shook
hands
i
am
glad
that
you
are
still
here
he
said
heartily
excuse
me
while
i
bathe
and
change
we
will
dine
a
little
earlier
so
far
i
have
not
eaten
a
long
trek
dominey
asked
curiously
i
have
trekked
far
was
the
quiet
reply
at
dinner
time
von
ragastein
was
once
more
himself
immaculate
in
white
duck
with
clean
linen
shaved
and
with
little
left
of
his
fatigue
there
was
something
different
in
his
manner
however
some
change
which
puzzled
dominey
he
was
at
once
more
attentive
to
his
guest
yet
further
removed
from
him
in
spirit
and
sympathy
he
kept
the
conversation
with
curious
insistence
upon
incidents
of
their
school
and
college
days
upon
the
subject
of
dominey
friends
and
relations
and
the
later
episodes
of
his
life
dominey
felt
himself
all
the
time
encouraged
to
talk
about
his
earlier
life
and
all
the
time
he
was
conscious
that
for
some
reason
or
other
his
host
closest
and
most
minute
attention
was
being
given
to
his
slightest
word
champagne
had
been
served
and
served
freely
and
dominey
up
to
the
very
gates
of
that
one
secret
chamber
talked
volubly
and
without
reserve
after
the
meal
was
over
their
chairs
were
dragged
as
before
into
the
open
the
silent
orderly
produced
even
larger
cigars
and
dominey
found
his
glass
filled
once
more
with
the
wonderful
brandy
the
doctor
had
left
them
to
visit
the
native
camp
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
and
the
orderly
was
busy
inside
clearing
the
table
only
the
black
shapes
of
the
servants
were
dimly
visible
as
they
twirled
their
fans
and
overhead
the
gleaming
stars
they
were
alone
i
been
talking
an
awful
lot
of
rot
about
myself
dominey
said
tell
me
a
little
about
your
career
now
and
your
life
in
germany
before
you
came
out
here
von
ragastein
made
no
immediate
reply
and
a
curious
silence
ebbed
and
flowed
between
the
two
men
every
now
and
then
a
star
shot
across
the
sky
the
red
rim
of
the
moon
rose
a
little
higher
from
behind
the
mountains
the
bush
stillness
always
the
most
mysterious
of
silences
seemed
gradually
to
become
charged
with
unvoiced
passion
soon
the
animals
began
to
call
around
them
creeping
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
fire
which
burned
at
the
end
of
the
open
space
my
friend
von
ragastein
said
at
last
speaking
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
spent
much
time
in
deliberation
you
speak
to
me
of
germany
of
my
homeland
perhaps
you
have
guessed
that
it
is
not
duty
alone
which
has
brought
me
here
to
these
wild
places
i
too
left
behind
me
a
dominey
quick
impulse
of
sympathy
was
smothered
by
the
stern
almost
harsh
repression
of
the
other
manner
the
words
seemed
to
have
been
torn
from
his
throat
there
was
no
spark
of
tenderness
or
regret
in
his
set
face
since
the
day
of
my
banishment
he
went
on
no
word
of
this
matter
has
passed
my
lips
it
is
not
weakness
which
assails
me
but
a
desire
to
yield
to
the
strange
arm
of
coincidence
you
and
i
schoolmates
and
college
friends
though
sons
of
a
different
country
meet
here
in
the
wilderness
each
with
the
iron
in
our
souls
i
shall
tell
you
the
thing
which
happened
to
me
and
you
shall
speak
to
me
of
your
own
i
can
not
dominey
groaned
but
you
will
was
the
stern
reply
an
hour
passed
and
the
voices
of
the
two
men
had
ceased
the
howling
of
the
animals
had
lessened
with
the
paling
of
the
fires
and
a
slow
melancholy
ripple
of
breeze
was
passing
through
the
bush
and
lapping
the
surface
of
the
river
it
was
von
ragastein
who
broke
through
what
might
almost
have
seemed
a
trance
he
rose
to
his
feet
vanished
inside
the
banda
and
reappeared
a
moment
or
two
later
with
two
tumblers
one
he
set
down
in
the
space
provided
for
it
in
the
arm
of
his
guest
chair
i
break
what
has
become
a
rule
with
me
he
announced
i
shall
drink
a
whisky
and
soda
i
shall
drink
to
the
new
things
that
may
yet
come
to
both
of
you
are
giving
up
your
work
here
dominey
asked
curiously
i
am
part
of
a
great
machine
was
the
somewhat
evasive
reply
i
have
nothing
to
do
but
a
flicker
of
passion
distorted
dominey
face
flamed
for
a
moment
in
his
tone
are
you
content
to
live
and
die
like
this
he
demanded
do
you
want
to
get
back
to
where
a
different
sort
of
sun
will
warm
your
heart
and
fill
your
pulses
this
primitive
world
is
in
its
way
colossal
but
it
is
human
it
is
a
life
for
humans
we
want
streets
von
ragastein
you
and
i
we
want
the
tide
of
people
flowing
around
us
the
roar
of
wheels
and
the
hum
of
human
voices
curse
these
animals
if
i
live
in
this
country
much
longer
i
shall
go
on
all
you
yield
too
much
to
environment
his
companion
observed
in
the
life
of
the
cities
you
would
be
a
no
city
nor
any
civilised
country
will
ever
claim
me
again
dominey
sighed
i
should
never
have
the
courage
to
face
what
might
von
ragastein
rose
to
his
feet
the
dim
outline
of
his
erect
form
was
in
a
way
majestic
he
seemed
to
tower
over
the
man
who
lounged
in
the
chair
before
him
finish
your
whisky
and
soda
to
our
next
meeting
friend
of
my
school
days
he
begged
before
you
awake
i
shall
be
so
soon
by
night
von
ragastein
replied
i
must
be
on
the
other
side
of
those
mountains
this
must
be
our
dominey
was
querulous
almost
pathetic
he
had
a
sudden
hatred
of
solitude
i
must
trek
westward
myself
directly
he
protested
or
eastward
or
northward
it
does
so
much
matter
ca
we
travel
together
von
ragastein
shook
his
head
i
travel
officially
and
i
must
travel
alone
he
replied
as
for
yourself
they
will
be
breaking
up
here
but
they
will
lend
you
an
escort
and
put
you
in
the
direction
you
wish
to
take
this
alas
is
as
much
as
i
can
do
for
you
for
us
it
must
be
well
i
ca
force
myself
upon
you
dominey
said
a
little
wistfully
it
seems
strange
though
to
meet
right
out
here
far
away
even
from
the
of
life
just
to
shake
hands
and
pass
on
i
am
sick
to
death
of
niggers
and
it
is
fate
von
ragastein
decided
where
i
go
i
must
go
alone
farewell
dear
friend
we
will
drink
the
toast
we
drank
our
last
night
in
your
rooms
at
magdalen
that
sanscrit
man
translated
it
for
us
each
find
what
he
seeks
we
must
follow
our
dominey
laughed
a
little
bitterly
he
pointed
to
a
light
glowing
fitfully
in
the
bush
my
he
muttered
recklessly
leading
where
i
shall
follow
into
the
swamps
a
few
minutes
later
dominey
threw
himself
upon
his
couch
curiously
and
unaccountably
drowsy
von
ragastein
who
had
come
in
to
wish
him
good
night
stood
looking
down
at
him
for
several
moments
with
significant
intentness
then
satisfied
that
his
guest
really
slept
he
turned
and
passed
through
the
hanging
curtain
of
dried
grasses
into
the
next
banda
where
the
doctor
still
fully
dressed
was
awaiting
him
they
spoke
together
in
german
and
with
lowered
voices
von
ragastein
had
lost
something
of
his
imperturbability
everything
progresses
according
to
my
orders
he
demanded
everything
excellency
the
boys
are
being
loaded
and
a
runner
has
gone
on
to
wadihuan
for
ponies
to
be
they
know
that
i
wish
to
start
at
dawn
all
will
be
prepared
von
ragastein
laid
his
hand
upon
the
doctor
shoulder
come
outside
schmidt
he
said
i
have
something
to
tell
you
of
my
the
two
men
seated
themselves
in
the
long
wicker
chairs
the
doctor
in
an
attitude
of
strict
attention
von
ragastein
turned
his
head
and
listened
from
dominey
quarters
came
the
sound
of
deep
and
regular
breathing
i
have
formed
a
great
plan
schmidt
von
ragastein
proceeded
you
know
what
news
has
come
to
me
from
berlin
your
excellency
has
told
me
a
little
the
doctor
reminded
him
the
day
arrives
von
ragastein
pronounced
his
voice
shaking
with
deep
emotion
he
paused
a
moment
in
thought
and
continued
the
time
even
the
month
is
fixed
i
am
recalled
from
here
to
take
the
place
for
which
i
was
destined
you
know
what
that
place
is
you
know
why
i
was
sent
to
an
english
public
school
and
college
i
can
i
am
to
take
up
my
residence
in
england
i
am
to
have
a
special
mission
i
am
to
find
a
place
for
myself
there
as
an
englishman
the
means
are
left
to
my
ingenuity
listen
schmidt
a
great
idea
has
come
to
the
doctor
lit
a
cigar
i
listen
von
ragastein
rose
to
his
feet
not
content
with
the
sound
of
that
regular
breathing
he
made
his
way
to
the
opening
of
the
banda
and
gazed
in
at
dominey
slumbering
form
then
he
returned
it
is
something
which
you
do
not
wish
the
englishman
to
hear
the
doctor
asked
it
we
speak
in
languages
was
the
cautious
reply
happen
to
be
that
man
only
accomplishment
he
can
speak
german
as
fluently
as
you
or
i
that
however
is
of
no
consequence
he
sleeps
and
he
will
continue
to
sleep
i
mixed
him
a
sleeping
draught
with
his
whisky
and
ah
the
doctor
grunted
my
principal
need
in
england
is
an
identity
von
ragastein
pointed
out
i
have
made
up
my
mind
i
shall
take
this
englishman
i
shall
return
to
england
as
sir
everard
so
there
is
a
remarkable
likeness
between
us
and
dominey
has
not
seen
an
englishman
who
knows
him
for
eight
or
ten
years
any
school
or
college
friends
whom
i
may
encounter
i
shall
be
able
to
satisfy
i
have
stayed
at
dominey
i
know
dominey
relatives
he
has
babbled
for
hours
telling
me
many
things
that
it
is
well
for
me
to
what
about
his
near
relatives
he
has
none
nearer
than
no
wife
von
ragastein
paused
and
turned
his
head
the
deep
breathing
inside
the
banda
had
certainly
ceased
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
stealing
uneasily
to
the
opening
gazed
down
upon
his
guest
outstretched
form
to
all
appearance
dominey
still
slept
deeply
after
a
moment
or
two
watch
von
ragastein
returned
to
his
place
therein
lies
his
tragedy
he
confided
dropping
his
voice
a
little
lower
she
is
insane
insane
it
seems
through
a
shock
for
which
he
was
responsible
she
might
have
been
the
only
stumbling
block
and
she
is
as
though
she
did
not
it
is
a
great
scheme
the
doctor
murmured
enthusiastically
it
is
a
wonderful
one
that
great
and
unrevealed
power
schmidt
which
watches
over
our
country
and
which
will
make
her
mistress
of
the
world
must
have
guided
this
man
to
us
my
position
in
england
will
be
unique
as
sir
everard
dominey
i
shall
be
able
to
penetrate
into
the
inner
circles
of
society
perhaps
even
of
political
life
i
shall
be
able
if
necessary
to
remain
in
england
even
after
the
storm
supposing
the
doctor
suggested
this
man
dominey
should
return
to
england
von
ragastein
turned
his
head
and
looked
towards
his
questioner
he
must
not
he
pronounced
so
the
doctor
murmured
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
dominey
with
a
couple
of
boys
for
escort
and
his
rifle
slung
across
his
shoulder
rode
into
the
bush
along
the
way
he
had
come
the
little
fat
doctor
stood
and
watched
him
waving
his
hat
until
he
was
out
of
sight
then
he
called
to
the
orderly
heinrich
he
said
you
are
sure
that
the
herr
englishman
has
the
whisky
the
water
bottles
are
filled
with
nothing
else
herr
doctor
the
man
replied
there
is
no
water
or
soda
water
in
the
pack
not
one
drop
herr
how
much
food
one
day
the
beef
is
salt
it
is
very
salt
herr
and
the
compass
it
is
ten
degrees
the
boys
have
their
orders
they
understand
perfectly
herr
doctor
if
the
englishman
does
not
drink
they
will
take
him
at
midnight
to
where
his
excellency
will
be
encamped
at
the
bend
of
the
blue
the
doctor
sighed
he
was
not
at
heart
an
unkindly
man
i
think
he
murmured
it
will
be
better
for
the
englishman

john

mangan
of

inn
gazed
at
the
card
which
a
junior
clerk
had
just
presented
in
blank
astonishment
an
astonishment
which
became
speedily
blended
with
dismay
good
god
do
you
see
this
harrison
he
exclaimed
passing
it
over
to
his
manager
with
whom
he
had
been
in
consultation
dominey
sir
everard
dominey
back
here
in
england
the
head
clerk
glanced
at
the
narrow
piece
of
pasteboard
and
sighed
i
afraid
you
will
find
him
rather
a
troublesome
client
sir
he
remarked
his
employer
frowned
of
course
i
shall
he
answered
testily
there
is
an
extra
penny
to
be
had
out
of
the
estates
you
know
that
harrison
the
last
two
quarters
allowance
which
we
sent
to
africa
came
out
of
the
timber
why
the
mischief
did
he
stay
where
he
was
what
shall
i
tell
the
gentleman
sir
the
boy
enquired
oh
show
him
in
mangan
directed
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
see
him
sooner
or
later
i
finish
these
affidavits
after
lunch
the
solicitor
composed
his
features
to
welcome
a
client
who
however
troublesome
his
affairs
had
become
still
represented
a
family
who
had
been
valued
patrons
of
the
firm
for
several
generations
he
was
prepared
to
greet
a
and
degenerate
individual
looking
older
than
his
years
instead
he
found
himself
extending
his
hand
to
one
of
the
best
turned
out
and
handsomest
men
who
had
ever
crossed
the
threshold
of
his
not
very
inviting
office
for
a
moment
he
stared
at
his
visitor
speechless
then
certain
points
of
familiarity
the
nose
the
rather
grey
eyes
presented
themselves
this
surprise
enabled
him
to
infuse
a
little
real
heartiness
into
his
welcome
my
dear
sir
everard
he
exclaimed
this
is
a
most
unexpected
pleasure
most
unexpected
such
a
pity
too
that
we
only
posted
a
draft
for
your
allowance
a
few
days
ago
dear
me
you
forgive
my
saying
so
how
well
you
look
dominey
smiled
as
he
accepted
an
easy
chair
africa
a
wonderful
country
mangan
he
remarked
with
just
that
faint
note
of
patronage
in
his
tone
which
took
his
listener
back
to
the
days
of
his
present
client
father
it
pardon
my
remarking
it
has
done
wonderful
things
for
you
sir
everard
let
me
see
it
must
be
eleven
years
since
we
sir
everard
tapped
the
toes
of
his
carefully
polished
brown
shoes
with
the
end
of
his
walking
stick
i
left
london
he
murmured
reminiscently
in
april
nineteen
hundred
and
two
yes
eleven
years
mangan
it
seems
queer
to
find
myself
in
london
again
as
i
dare
say
you
can
precisely
the
lawyer
murmured
i
was
just
wondering
i
think
that
last
remittance
we
sent
to
you
could
be
stopped
i
have
no
doubt
you
will
be
glad
of
a
little
ready
money
he
added
with
a
confident
smile
thanks
i
do
think
i
need
any
just
at
present
was
the
amazing
answer
we
talk
about
financial
affairs
a
little
later
mangan
metaphorically
pinched
himself
he
had
known
his
present
client
even
during
his
school
days
had
received
a
great
many
visits
from
him
at
different
times
and
could
not
remember
one
in
which
the
question
of
finance
had
been
dismissed
in
so
casual
a
manner
i
trust
he
observed
chiefly
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
that
you
are
thinking
of
settling
down
here
for
a
time
now
i
have
finished
with
africa
if
that
is
what
you
mean
was
the
somewhat
grave
reply
as
to
settling
down
here
well
that
depends
a
little
upon
what
you
have
to
tell
the
lawyer
nodded
i
think
he
said
that
you
may
make
yourself
quite
easy
as
regards
the
matter
of
roger
unthank
nothing
has
ever
been
heard
of
him
since
the
day
you
left
his
body
has
not
been
found
nor
any
trace
of
there
was
a
brief
silence
the
lawyer
looked
hard
at
dominey
and
dominey
searchingly
back
again
at
the
lawyer
and
lady
dominey
the
former
asked
at
length
her
ladyship
condition
is
i
believe
unchanged
was
the
somewhat
guarded
reply
if
the
circumstances
are
favourable
dominey
continued
after
another
moment
pause
i
think
it
very
likely
that
i
may
decide
to
settle
down
at
dominey
the
lawyer
appeared
doubtful
i
am
afraid
he
said
you
will
be
very
disappointed
in
the
condition
of
the
estate
sir
everard
as
i
have
repeatedly
told
you
in
our
correspondence
the
rent
roll
after
deducting
your
settlement
upon
lady
dominey
has
at
no
time
reached
the
interest
on
the
mortgages
and
we
have
had
to
make
up
the
difference
and
send
you
your
allowance
out
of
the
proceeds
of
the
outlying
that
is
a
pity
dominey
replied
with
a
frown
i
ought
perhaps
to
have
taken
you
more
into
my
confidence
by
the
by
he
added
when
er
about
when
did
you
receive
my
last
letter
your
last
letter
mangan
repeated
we
have
not
had
the
privilege
of
hearing
from
you
sir
everard
for
over
four
years
the
only
intimation
we
had
that
our
payments
had
reached
you
was
the
exceedingly
prompt
debit
of
the
south
african
i
have
certainly
been
to
blame
this
unexpected
visitor
confessed
on
the
other
hand
i
have
been
very
much
absorbed
if
you
have
happened
to
hear
any
south
african
gossip
lately
mangan
i
suppose
it
will
be
a
surprise
to
you
to
hear
that
i
have
been
making
a
good
deal
of
making
money
the
lawyer
gasped
you
making
money
sir
everard
i
thought
you
be
surprised
dominey
observed
coolly
however
that
neither
here
nor
there
the
business
object
of
my
visit
to
you
this
morning
is
to
ask
you
to
make
arrangements
as
quickly
as
possible
for
paying
off
the
mortgages
on
the
dominey

than

and

instead
of
saying
god
bless
my

he
exclaimed
great
scott
dropped
a
very
eyeglass
from
his
left
eye
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
i
have
had
three
or
four
years
of
good
luck
his
client
continued
i
have
made
money
in
gold
mines
in
diamond
mines
and
in
land
i
am
afraid
that
if
i
had
stayed
out
another
year
i
should
have
descended
altogether
to
the
commonplace
and
come
back
a
my
heartiest
congratulations
mangan
found
breath
to
murmur
you
forgive
my
being
so
astonished
but
you
are
the
first
dominey
i
ever
knew
who
has
ever
made
a
penny
of
money
in
any
sort
of
way
and
from
what
i
remember
of
you
in
england
i
sure
you
forgive
my
being
so
frank
i
should
never
have
expected
you
to
have
even
attempted
such
a
dominey
smiled
well
he
said
if
you
inquire
at
the
united
bank
of
africa
you
will
find
that
i
have
a
credit
balance
there
of
something
over
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
then
i
have
also
well
let
us
say
a
trifle
more
invested
in
mines
do
me
the
favour
of
lunching
with
me
mangan
and
although
africa
will
never
be
a
favourite
topic
of
conversation
with
me
i
will
tell
you
about
some
of
my
the
solicitor
groped
around
for
his
hat
i
will
send
the
boy
for
a
taxi
he
faltered
i
have
a
car
outside
this
astonishing
client
told
him
before
we
leave
could
you
instruct
your
clerk
to
have
a
list
of
the
dominey
mortgages
made
out
with
the
terminable
dates
and
redemption
values
i
will
leave
instructions
mangan
promised
i
think
that
the
total
amount
is
under
eighty
thousand
dominey
sauntered
through
the
office
an
object
of
much
interest
to
the
little
staff
of
clerks
the
lawyer
joined
him
on
the
pavement
in
a
few
minutes
where
shall
we
lunch
dominey
asked
i
afraid
my
clubs
are
a
little
out
of
date
i
am
staying
at
the
the
carlton
grill
room
is
quite
excellent
mangan
suggested
they
are
keeping
me
a
table
until
one
dominey
replied
we
will
lunch
there
by
all
they
drove
off
together
the
returned
traveller
gazing
all
the
time
out
of
the
window
into
the
crowded
streets
the
lawyer
a
little
thoughtful
while
i
think
of
it
sir
everard
the
latter
said
as
they
drew
near
their
destination
i
should
be
glad
of
a
short
conversation
with
you
before
you
go
down
to
with
regard
to
anything
in
particular
with
regard
to
lady
dominey
the
lawyer
told
him
a
little
gravely
a
shadow
rested
on
his
companion
face
is
her
ladyship
very
much
changed
physically
she
is
in
excellent
health
i
believe
mentally
i
believe
that
there
is
no
change
she
has
unfortunately
the
same
rather
violent
prejudice
which
i
am
afraid
influenced
your
departure
from
in
plain
words
dominey
said
bitterly
she
has
sworn
to
take
my
life
if
ever
i
sleep
under
the
same
she
will
need
i
am
afraid
to
be
strictly
watched
the
lawyer
answered
evasively
still
i
think
you
ought
to
be
told
that
time
does
not
seem
to
have
lessened
her
tragical
she
regards
me
still
as
the
murderer
of
roger
unthank
dominey
asked
in
a
measured
tone
i
am
afraid
she
and
i
suppose
that
every
one
else
has
the
same
idea
the
mystery
mangan
admitted
has
never
been
cleared
up
it
is
well
known
you
see
that
you
fought
in
the
park
and
that
you
staggered
home
almost
senseless
roger
unthank
has
never
been
seen
from
that
day
to
if
i
had
killed
him
dominey
pointed
out
why
was
his
body
not
found
the
lawyer
shook
his
head
there
are
all
sorts
of
theories
of
course
he
said
but
for
one
superstition
you
may
as
well
be
prepared
there
is
scarcely
a
man
or
a
woman
for
miles
around
dominey
who
does
believe
that
the
ghost
of
roger
unthank
still
haunts
the
black
wood
near
where
you
let
us
be
quite
clear
about
this
dominey
insisted
if
the
body
should
ever
be
found
am
i
liable
after
all
these
years
to
be
indicted
for
manslaughter
i
think
you
may
make
your
mind
quite
at
ease
the
lawyer
assured
him
in
the
first
place
i
do
think
you
would
ever
be
and
in
the
second
there
is
a
human
being
in
that
part
of
norfolk
would
ever
believe
that
the
body
of
man
or
beast
left
within
the
shadow
of
the
black
wood
would
ever
be
seen
or
heard
of
again

on
their
way
into

grill
room

for
a
few
minutes
in
the
small
reception
room
chatting
with
some
acquaintances
whilst
his
host
having
spoken
to
the
and
ordered
a
cocktail
from
a
passing
waiter
stood
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
watching
the
inflow
of

and
women
with
all
that
interest
which
one
might
be
supposed
to
feel
in
one

after
a
prolonged
absence
he
had
moved
a
little
to
one
side
to
allow
a
party
of
young
people
to
make
their
way
through
the
crowded
chamber
when
he
was
conscious
of
a
woman
standing
alone
on
the
topmost
of
the
three
thickly
carpeted
stairs
their
eyes
met
and
hers
which
had
been
wandering
around
the
room
as
though
in
search
of
some
acquaintance
seemed
instantly
and
fervently
held
to
the
few
loungers
about
the
room
ignorant
of
any
special
significance
in
that
studied
contemplation
of
the
man

the
part

the
woman
their
two
personalities
presented
an
agreeable
almost
a
fascinating
study
dominey
was
six
feet
two
in
height
and
had
to
its
fullest
extent
the
natural
distinction
of
his
class
together
with
the
half
military
half
athletic
bearing
which
seemed
to
have
been
so
marvellously
restored
to
him
his
complexion
was
no
more
than
becomingly
tanned
his
slight
moustache
trimmed
very
close
to
the
upper
lip
was
of
the
same
ruddy
brown
shade
as
his
sleekly
brushed
hair
the
woman
who
had
commenced
now
to
move
slowly
towards
him
save
that
her
cheeks
at
that
moment
at
any
rate
were
almost
unnaturally
pale
was
of
the
same
colouring
her
hair
gleamed
beneath
her
black
hat
she
was
tall
a
grecian
type
of
figure
large
without
being
coarse
majestic
though
still
young
she
carried
a
little
dog
under
one
arm
and
a
plain
black
silk
bag
on
which
was
a
coronet
in
platinum
and
diamonds
in
the
other
hand
the
who
presided
over
the
room
watching
her
approach
bowed
with
more
than
his
usual
urbanity
her
eyes
however
were
still
fixed
upon
the
person
who
had
engaged
so
large
a
share
of
her
attention
she
came
towards
him

lips

little
parted

faltered

why
did
you
not
let
me
know
dominey
bowed
very
slightly
his
words
seemed
to
have
a
cut
and
dried
flavour
i
am
so
sorry
he
replied
but
i
fear
that
you
make
a
mistake
my
name
is
not
she
stood
quite
still
looking
at
him
with
the
air
of
not
having
heard
a
word
of
his
polite
disclaimer
in
london
of
all
places
she
murmured
tell
me
what
does
it
mean
i
can
only
repeat
madam
he
said
that
to
my
very
great
regret
i
have
not
the
honour
of
your
she

puzzled
but
absolutely
unconvinced

mean
to
deny
that
you
are

asked
incredulously
you
do
not
know
me
madam
he
answered
it
is
not
my
great
pleasure
my
name
is
dominey
everard
she
seemed
for
a
moment
to
be
struggling
with
some
embarrassment
which
approached
emotion
then
she
laid
her
fingers
upon
his
sleeve
and
drew
him
to
a
more
retired
corner
of
the
little
apartment
leopold
she
whispered
nothing
can
make
it
wrong
or
indiscreet
for
you
to
visit
me
my
address
is
belgrave
square
i
desire
to
see
you
at
seven
but
my
dear
lady
dominey
began
her
eyes
suddenly
glowed
with
a
new
light
i
will
not
be
trifled
with
she
insisted
if
you
wish
to
succeed
in
whatever
scheme
you
have
on
hand
you
must
not
make
an
enemy
of
me
i
shall
expect
you
at
seven
she
passed
away
from
him
into
the
restaurant
mangan
now
freed
from
his
friends
rejoined
his
host
and
the
two
men
took
their
places
at
the
side
table
to
which
they
were
ushered
with
many
signs
of
attention
was
that
the
princess
eiderstrom
with
whom
you
were
talking
the
solicitor
asked
curiously
a
lady
addressed
me
by
mistake
dominey
explained
she
mistook
me
curiously
enough
for
a
man
who
used
to
be
called
my
double
at
oxford
sigismund
devinter
he
was
then
although
i
think
he
came
into
a
title
later
the
princess
is
quite
a
famous
personage

remarked
one
of
the
richest
widows
in
europe
her
husband
was
killed
in
a
duel
some
six
or
seven
years
dominey
ordered
the
luncheon
with
care
slipping
into
a
word
or
two
of
german
once
to
assist
the
waiter
who
spoke
english
with
difficulty
his
companion
smiled
i
see
that
you
have
not
forgotten
your
languages
out
there
in
the
i
had
no
chance
to

answered
i
spent
five
years
on
the
borders
of
german
east
africa
and
i
traded
with
some
of
the
fellows
there
by
the
by
mangan
enquired
what
sort
of
terms
are
we
on
with
the
germans
out
there
excellent
i
should
think
was
the
careless
reply
i
never
had
any
of
course
the
lawyer
continued
this
will
all
be
new
to
you
but
during
the
last
few
years
englishmen
have
become
divided
into
two
classes
the
people
who
believe
that
the
germans
wish
to
go
to
war
and
crush
us
and
those
who
then
since
my
return
the
number
of
the
has
been
increased
by
i
am
amongst
the
doubtfuls
myself
mangan
remarked
all
the
same
i
ca
quite
see
what
germany
wants
with
such
an
immense
army
and
why
she
is
continually
adding
to
her
dominey
paused
for
a
moment
to
discuss
the
matter
of
a
sauce
with
the
head
waiter
he
returned
to
the
subject
a
few
minutes
later
on
however
of
course
he
pointed
out
my
opinions
can
only
come
from
a
study
of
the
newspapers
and
from
conversations
with
such
germans
as
i
have
met
out
in
africa
but
so
far
as
her
army
is
concerned
i
should
have
said
that
russia
and
france
were
responsible
for
that
and
the
more
powerful
it
is
the
less
chance
of
any
european
conflagration
russia
might
at
any
time
come
to
the
conclusion
that
a
war
is
her
only
salvation
against
a
revolution
and
you
know
the
feeling
in
france
about
as
well
as
i
do
the
germans
themselves
say
that
there
is
more
interest
in
military
matters
and
more
progress
being
made
in
russia
than
ever
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
are
right
agreed
mangan
it
is
a
matter
which
is
being
a
great
deal
discussed
just
now
however
let
us
speak
of
your
personal
plans
what
do
you
intend
to
do
for
the
next
few
weeks
say
have
you
been
to
see
any
of
your
relatives
yet
not
one
dominey
replied
i
am
afraid
that
i
am
not
altogether
keen
about
making
mangan
coughed
you
must
remember
that
during
the
period
of
your
last
residence
in
london
he
said
you
were
in
a
state
of
chronic
impecuniosity
no
doubt
that
rather
affected
the
attitude
of
some
of
those
who
would
otherwise
have
been
more
i
should
be
perfectly
content
never
to
see
one
of
them
again
declared
dominey
with
perfect
truth
that
of
course
is
impossible
the
lawyer
protested
you
must
go
and
see
the
duchess
at
any
rate
she
was
always
your
the
duchess
was
always
very
kind
to
me
dominey
admitted
doubtfully
but
i
am
afraid
she
was
rather
fed
up
before
i
left
mangan
smiled
he
was
enjoying
a
very
excellent
lunch
which
it
seemed
hard
to
believe
was
ordered
by
a
man
just
home
from
the
wilds
of
africa
and
he
thoroughly
enjoyed
talking
about
duchesses
her
grace
he
began
well
the
lawyer
had
paused
with
his
eyes
glued
upon
the
couple
at
a
neighbouring
table
he
leaned
across
towards
his
companion
the
duchess
herself
sir
everard
just
behind
you
with
lord
this
place
must
certainly
be
the
rendezvous
of
all
the
world
dominey
declared
as
he
held
out
his
hand
to
a
man
who
had
approached
their
table
seaman
my
friend
welcome
let
me
introduce
you
to
my
friend
and
legal
adviser
mangan
mr
seaman
was
a
short
fat
man
immaculately
dressed
in
most
conventional
morning
attire
he
was
almost
bald
except
for
a
little
tuft
on
either
side
and
a
few
long
fair
hairs
carefully
brushed
back
over
a
shining
scalp
his
face
was
extraordinarily
round
except
towards
his
chin
where
it
came
to
a
point
his
eyes
bright
and
keen
his
mouth
the
mouth
of
a
professional
humourist
he
shook
hands
with
the
lawyer
with
an
which
was
scarcely
english
within
the
space
of
half
an
hour
dominey
continued
i
find
a
princess
who
desires
to
claim
my
acquaintance
a
cousin
he
dropped
his
voice
a
little
who
lunches
only
a
few
tables
away
and
the
man
of
whom
i
have
seen
the
most
during
the
last
ten
years
amidst
scenes
a
little
different
from
these
eh
seaman
seaman
accepted
the
chair
which
the
waiter
had
brought
and
sat
down
the
lawyer
was
immediately
interested
do
i
understand
then
he
asked
addressing
the
newcomer
that
you
knew
sir
everard
in
africa
seaman
beamed
knew
him
he
repeated
and
with
the
first
words
of
his
speech
the
fact
of
his
foreign
nationality
was
established
there
was
no
one
of
whom
i
knew
so
much
we
did
business
together
a
great
deal
of
business
and
when
we
were
not
partners
sir
everard
generally
got
the
best
of
dominey
laughed
luck
generally
comes
to
a
man
either
early
or
late
in
life
my
luck
came
late
i
think
seaman
that
you
must
have
been
my
mascot
nothing
went
wrong
with
me
during
the
years
that
we
did
business
seaman
was
a
little
excited
he
brushed
upright
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
one
of
those
little
tufts
of
hair
left
on
the
side
of
his
head
and
he
laid
his
plump
fingers
upon
the
lawyer
shoulder
mr
mangan
he
said
you
listen
to
me
i
sell
this
man
the
controlling
interests
in
a
mine
shares
which
i
have
held
for
four
and
a
half
years
and
never
drew
a
penny
dividend
i
sell
them
to
him
i
say
at
par
well
i
need
the
money
and
it
seems
to
me
that
i
had
given
the
shares
a
fair
chance
within
five
weeks
five
weeks
sir
he
repeated
struggling
to
attune
his
voice
to
his
civilised
surroundings
those
shares
had
gone
from
par
to
fourteen
and
a
half
they
stand
at
twenty
he
gave
me
five
thousand
pounds
for
those
shares
he
could
walk
into
your
stock
market
and
sell
them
for
one
hundred
thousand
that
is
the
way
money
is
made
in
africa
mangan
where
innocents
like
me
are
to
be
found
every
dominey
poured
out
a
glass
of
wine
and
passed
it
to
their
visitor
come
he
said
we
all
have
our
ups
and
downs
africa
owes
you
nothing
i
have
done
well
in
my
small
way
seaman
admitted
fingering
the
stem
of
his
wineglass
but
where
i
have
had
to
plod
sir
everard
here
has
stood
and
commanded
fate
to
pour
her
treasures
into
his
the
lawyer
was
listening
with
a
curious
interest
and
pleasure
to
this
half
bantering
conversation
he
found
an
opportunity
now
to
intervene
so
you
two
were
really
friends
in
africa
he
remarked
with
a
queer
and
almost
inexplicable
sense
of
relief
if
sir
everard
permits
our
association
to
be
so
called
seaman
replied
we
have
done
business
together
in
the
great
cities
in
johannesburg
and
pretoria
in
kimberley
and
cape
town
and
we
have
prospected
together
in
the
wild
places
we
have
trekked
the
veldt
and
been
lost
to
the
world
for
many
months
at
a
time
we
have
seen
the
real
wonders
of
africa
together
as
well
as
her
tawdry
and
you
too
mangan
asked
have
you
retired
seaman
smile
was
almost
beatific
the
same
deal
he
said
which
brought
sir
everard
fortune
to
wonderful
figures
brought
me
that
modest
sum
which
i
had
sworn
to
reach
before
i
returned
to
england
it
is
true
i
have
retired
from
it
is
now
that
i
take
up
again
my
real
life
if
you
are
going
to
talk
about
your
hobby
dominey
observed
you
had
better
order
them
to
serve
your
lunch
i
had
finished
my
lunch
before
you
came
in
his
friend
replied
i
drink
another
glass
of
wine
with
you
perhaps
afterwards
a
liqueur
who
can
say
in
this
climate
one
is
favoured
one
can
drink
freely
sir
everard
and
i
mangan
have
been
in
places
where
thirst
is
a
thing
to
be
struggled
against
where
for
months
a
little
weak
brandy
and
water
was
our
chief
tell
me
about
this
hobby
the
lawyer
enquired
dominey
intervened
promptly
i
protest
if
he
begins
to
talk
of
that
he
be
here
all
the
seaman
held
out
his
hands
and
rolled
his
head
from
side
to
side
but
i
am
not
so
unreasonable
he
objected
just
one
word
so
very
well
then
he
proceeded
quickly
with
the
air
of
one
fearing
interruption
this
must
be
clear
to
you
mangan
i
am
a
german
by
birth
naturalised
in
england
for
the
sake
of
my
business
loving
germany
grateful
to
england
one
third
of
my
life
i
have
lived
in
berlin
one
third
at
forest
hill
here
in
london
and
in
the
city
one
third
in
africa
i
have
watched
the
growth
of
commercial
rivalries
and
jealousies
between
the
two
nations
there
is
no
need
for
them
they
might
lead
to
worse
things
i
would
brush
them
all
away
my
aim
is
to
encourage
a
league
for
the
promotion
of
more
cordial
social
and
business
relations
between
the
people
of
great
britain
and
the
people
of
the
german
empire
there
have
i
wasted
much
of
your
time
can
i
not
speak
of
my
hobby
without
a
flood
of
words
conciseness
itself
mangan
admitted
and
i
compliment
you
most
heartily
upon
your
scheme
if
you
can
get
the
right
people
into
it
it
should
prove
a
most
valuable
in
germany
i
have
the
right
people
all
germans
who
live
for
their
country
and
feel
for
their
country
loathe
the
thought
of
war
we
want
peace
we
want
friends
and
to
speak
as
man
to
man
he
concluded
tapping
the
lawyer
upon
the
coat
sleeve
england
is
our
best
i
wish
one
could
believe
the
latter
remarked
that
yours
was
the
popular
voice
in
your
seaman
rose
reluctantly
to
his
feet
at
two
he
announced
glancing
at
his
watch
i
have
an
appointment
with
a
woollen
manufacturer
from
bradford
i
hope
to
get
him
to
join
my
he
bowed
ceremoniously
to
the
lawyer
nodded
to
dominey
with
the
familiarity
of
an
old
friend
and
made
his
bustling
way
out
of
the
room
a
sound
business
man
i
should
think
was
the
former
comment
i
wish
him
luck
with
his
league
you
yourself
sir
everard
will
need
to
develop
some
new
interests
why
not
politics
i
really
expect
to
find
life
a
little
difficult
at
first
admitted
dominey
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
i
have
lost
many
of
the
tastes
of
my
youth
and
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
my
friends
over
here
will
call
me
colonial
i
ca
fancy
myself
doing
nothing
down
in
norfolk
all
the
rest
of
my
days
perhaps
i
shall
go
into
you
must
forgive
my
saying
his
companion
declared
impulsively
that
i
never
knew
ten
years
make
such
a
difference
in
a
man
in
my
the
colonies
dominey
pronounced
are
a
kill
or
cure
sort
of
business
you
either
take
your
drubbing
and
come
out
a
stronger
man
or
you
go
under
i
had
the
very
narrowest
escape
from
going
under
myself
but
i
just
pulled
together
in
time
i
would
have
been
without
my
hard
times
for
anything
in
the
if
you
will
permit
me
mangan
said
with
an
inherited
pomposity
on
our
first
meeting
under
the
new
conditions
i
should
like
to
offer
you
my
hearty
congratulations
not
only
upon
what
you
have
accomplished
but
upon
what
you
have
and
also
i
hope
dominey
rejoined
smiling
a
little
seriously
and
with
a
curious
glint
in
his
eyes
upon
what
i
may
yet
the
duchess
and
her
companion
had
risen
to
their
feet
and
the
former
on
her
way
out
recognising
her
solicitor
paused
graciously
how
do
you
do
mangan
she
said
i
hope
you
are
looking
after
those
troublesome
tenants
of
mine
in
leicestershire
we
shall
make
our
report
in
due
course
duchess
mangan
assured
her
will
you
permit
me
he
added
to
bring
back
to
your
memory
a
relative
who
has
just
returned
from
abroad
sir
everard
dominey
dominey
had
risen
to
his
feet
a
moment
previously
and
now
extended
his
hand
the
duchess
who
was
a
tall
graceful
woman
with
masses
of
fair
hair
only
faintly
interspersed
with
grey
very
fine
brown
eyes
the
complexion
of
a
girl
and
to
quite
her
own
confession
the
manners
of
a
kitchen
maid
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
without
any
response
sir
everard
dominey
she
repeated
everard
ridiculous
dominey
extended
hand
was
at
once
withdrawn
and
the
tentative
smile
faded
from
his
lips
the
lawyer
plunged
into
the
breach
i
can
assure
your
grace
he
insisted
earnestly
that
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
about
sir
everard
identity
he
only
returned
from
africa
during
the
last
few
the
duchess
incredulity
remained
wholly
but
ministered
to
by
her
natural
obstinacy
i
simply
can
not
bring
myself
to
believe
it
she
declared
come
challenge
you
when
did
we
meet
last
at
worcester
house
was
the
prompt
reply
i
came
to
say
to
the
duchess
was
a
little
staggered
her
eyes
softened
a
faint
smile
played
at
the
corners
of
her
lips
she
was
suddenly
a
very
attractive
looking
woman
you
came
to
say
she
repeated
and
i
am
to
take
that
as
a
challenge
dominey
asked
standing
very
upright
and
looking
her
in
the
eyes
as
you
you
were
a
little
kinder
to
me
he
continued
than
you
are
you
gave
me
this
he
added
drawing
a
small
picture
from
his
pocketbook
and
you
permitted
for
heaven
sake
put
that
thing
away
she
cried
and
do
say
another
word
there
my
nephew
omar
paying
his
bill
almost
within
earshot
come
and
see
me
at
three
this
afternoon
and
do
be
a
minute
late
and
omar
she
went
on
turning
to
the
young
man
who
stood
now
by
her
side
this
is
a
connection
of
yours
sir
everard
dominey
he
is
a
terrible
person
but
do
shake
hands
with
him
and
come
along
i
am
half
an
hour
late
for
my
dressmaker
lord
omar
chuckled
vaguely
then
shook
hands
with
his
relative
nodded
affably
to
the
lawyer
and
followed
his
aunt
out
of
the
room
mangan
expression
was
beatific
sir
everard
he
exclaimed
god
bless
you
if
ever
a
woman
got
what
she
deserved
i
seen
a
duchess
blush
first
time
in
my
life
chapter
v
worcester
house
was
one
of
those
residences
set
down
apparently
for
no
reason
whatever
in
the
middle
of
regent
park
it
had
been
acquired
by
a
former
duke
at
the
instigation
of
the
regent
who
was
his
intimate
friend
and
retained
by
later
generations
in
mute
protest
against
the
disfiguring
edifices
which
had
made
a
millionaire
highway
of
park
lane
dominey
who
was
first
scrutinised
by
an
individual
in
buff
waistcoat
and
silk
hat
at
the
porter
lodge
was
interviewed
by
a
in
the
great
stone
hall
conducted
through
an
extraordinarily
victorian
by
another
myrmidon
in
a
buff
waistcoat
and
finally
ushered
into
a
tiny
little
boudoir
leading
out
of
a
larger
apartment
and
terminating
in
a
conservatory
filled
with
exotics
the
duchess
who
was
reclining
in
an
held
out
her
hand
which
her
visitor
raised
to
his
lips
she
motioned
him
to
a
seat
by
her
side
and
once
more
scrutinised
him
with
unabashed
intentness
there
something
wrong
about
you
you
know
she
declared
that
seems
very
unfortunate
he
rejoined
when
i
return
to
find
you
wholly
not
bad
she
remarked
critically
all
the
same
i
have
changed
i
am
not
in
the
least
in
love
with
you
any
it
was
the
fear
of
that
change
in
you
he
sighed
which
kept
me
for
so
long
in
the
furthest
corners
of
the
she
looked
at
him
with
a
severity
which
was
obviously
assumed
look
here
she
said
it
is
better
for
us
to
have
a
perfectly
clear
understanding
upon
one
point
i
know
the
exact
position
of
your
affairs
and
i
know
too
that
the
two
hundred
a
year
which
your
lawyer
has
been
sending
out
to
you
came
partly
out
of
a
few
old
trees
and
partly
out
of
his
own
pocket
how
you
are
going
to
live
over
here
i
can
not
imagine
but
it
is
the
least
use
expecting
henry
to
do
a
thing
for
you
the
poor
man
has
scarcely
enough
pocket
money
to
pay
his
travelling
expenses
when
he
goes
lecturing
dominey
repeated
what
happened
to
poor
henry
my
husband
is
an
exceedingly
conscientious
man
was
the
dignified
reply
he
goes
from
town
to
town
with
lord
roberts
and
a
secretary
lecturing
on
national
dear
henry
was
always
a
little
cranky
was
he
dominey
observed
let
me
put
your
mind
at
rest
on
that
other
matter
though
caroline
i
can
assure
you
that
i
have
come
back
to
england
not
to
borrow
money
but
to
spend
his
cousin
shook
her
head
mournfully
and
a
few
minutes
ago
i
was
nearly
observing
that
you
had
lost
your
sense
of
humour
i
am
in
earnest
he
persisted
africa
has
turned
out
to
be
my
eldorado
quite
unexpectedly
i
must
admit
i
came
in
for
a
considerable
sum
of
money
towards
the
end
of
my
stay
there
i
am
paying
off
the
mortgages
at
dominey
at
once
and
i
want
henry
to
jot
down
on
paper
at
once
those
few
amounts
he
was
good
enough
to
lend
me
in
the
old
caroline
duchess
of
worcester
sat
perfectly
still
for
a
moment
with
her
mouth
open
a
condition
which
was
entirely
natural
but
unbecoming
and
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
really
are
everard
dominey
she
exclaimed
the
weight
of
evidence
is
rather
that
way
he
murmured
he
moved
his
chair
deliberately
a
little
nearer
took
her
hand
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
her
face
was
perilously
near
to
his
she
drew
a
little
back
and
too
abruptly
my
dear
everard
she
whispered
henry
is
in
the
house
besides
yes
i
suppose
you
must
be
everard
just
now
there
was
something
in
your
eyes
exactly
like
his
but
you
are
so
stiff
have
you
been
drilling
out
there
or
anything
he
shook
his
head
one
spends
half
one
time
in
the
and
you
are
really
well
off
she
asked
again
wonderingly
if
i
had
stayed
there
another
year
he
replied
and
been
able
to
marry
a
dutch
jewess
i
should
have
qualified
for
park
she
sighed
it
too
wonderful
henry
will
love
having
his
money
and
you
she
looked
positively
distressed
you
lost
all
your
manners
she
complained
you
make
love
like
a
garden
rake
you
should
have
leaned
towards
me
with
a
quiver
in
your
voice
when
you
said
those
last
two
words
and
instead
of
that
you
look
as
though
you
were
sitting
at
attention
with
a
positive
glint
of
steel
in
your
one
sees
a
woman
once
in
a
blue
moon
out
there
he
pleaded
she
shook
her
head
you
changed
it
was
a
sixth
sense
with
you
to
make
love
in
exactly
the
right
tone
to
say
exactly
the
right
thing
in
the
right
i
shall
pick
it
up
he
declared
hopefully
with
a
little
she
made
a
little
grimace
you
wo
want
an
old
woman
like
me
to
assist
you
everard
you
have
the
town
at
your
feet
you
be
able
to
frivol
with
musical
comedy
flirt
with
our
married
beauties
or
i
sorry
everard
i
you
forgot
what
he
asked
steadfastly
i
forgot
the
tragedy
which
finally
drove
you
abroad
i
forgot
your
marriage
is
there
any
change
in
your
wife
not
much
i
am
and
mangan
he
thinks
that
you
are
safe
over
here
she
looked
at
him
earnestly
perhaps
she
had
never
admitted
even
to
herself
how
fond
she
had
been
of
this
scapegrace
cousin
you
find
that
no
one
will
have
a
word
to
say
against
you
she
told
him
now
that
you
are
wealthy
and
regenerate
they
forget
everything
you
want
them
to
when
will
you
come
and
dine
here
and
meet
all
your
relatives
whenever
you
are
kind
enough
to
ask
me
he
answered
i
thought
of
going
down
to
dominey
she
looked
at
him
with
a
new
thing
in
her
eyes
something
of
fear
something
too
of
admiration
but
your
wife
she
is
there
i
believe
he
said
i
can
not
help
it
i
have
been
an
exile
from
my
home
long
do
go
she
begged
suddenly
why
not
be
brave
and
have
her
removed
i
know
how
you
are
but
you
have
your
future
and
your
career
to
consider
for
her
sake
too
you
ought
not
to
give
her
the
opportunity
dominey
could
never
make
up
his
mind
whether
the
interruption
which
came
at
that
moment
was
welcome
or
otherwise
caroline
suddenly
broke
off
in
her
speech
and
glanced
warningly
towards
the
larger
room
a
tall
man
dressed
in
clothes
and
wearing
a
had
lifted
the
curtains
he
addressed
the
duchess
in
a
thin
reedy
voice
my
dear
caroline
he
began
ah
you
must
forgive
me
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
engaged
we
will
not
stay
but
i
should
like
to
present
to
you
a
young
friend
of
mine
who
is
going
to
help
me
at
the
meeting
this
do
bring
him
in
his
wife
replied
her
voice
once
more
attuned
to
its
natural
drawl
and
i
have
a
surprise
for
you
too
henry
a
very
great
surprise
i
think
you
will
find
it
dominey
rose
to
his
feet
a
tall
commanding
figure
and
stood
waiting
the
approach
of
the
newcomer
the
duke
advanced
looking
at
him
enquiringly
a
young
man
very
obviously
a
soldier
in
mufti
was
hovering
in
the
background
i
must
plead
guilty
to
the
surprise
the
duke
confessed
courteously
there
is
something
exceedingly
familiar
about
your
face
sir
but
i
can
not
remember
having
had
the
privilege
of
meeting
you
see
caroline
observed
i
am
not
the
only
one
everard
who
did
not
accept
you
upon
a
glance
this
is
everard
dominey
henry
returned
from
foreign
exile
and
regenerated
in
every
sense
of
the
how
do
you
do
dominey
said
holding
out
his
hand
i
seem
to
be
rather
a
surprise
to
every
one
but
i
hope
you
have
quite
forgotten
god
bless
my
soul
the
duke
exclaimed
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
really
everard
dominey
i
am
he
beyond
a
doubt
was
the
calm
assurance
most
amazing
the
duke
declared
as
he
shook
hands
most
amazing
i
never
saw
such
a
change
in
my
life
yes
yes
i
see
same
complexion
of
course
nose
and
eyes
yes
yes
but
you
seem
taller
and
you
carry
yourself
like
a
soldier
dear
dear
me
africa
has
done
wonderfully
by
you
delighted
my
dear
everard
delighted
you
be
more
delighted
still
when
you
hear
the
rest
of
the
news
his
wife
remarked
drily
in
the
meantime
do
present
your
precisely
so
the
duke
acquiesced
turning
to
the
young
man
in
the
background
most
sorry
my
dear
captain
bartram
the
unexpected
return
of
a
connection
of
my
wife
must
be
my
apology
for
this
lapse
of
manners
let
me
present
you
to
the
duchess
captain
bartram
is
just
back
from
germany
my
dear
and
is
an
enthusiastic
supporter
of
our
sir
everard
caroline
shook
hands
kindly
with
her
husband
protege
and
dominey
exchanged
a
solemn
handshake
with
him
you
too
are
one
of
those
then
captain
bartram
who
are
convinced
that
germany
has
evil
designs
upon
us
the
former
said
smiling
i
have
just
returned
from
germany
after
twelve
months
stay
there
the
young
soldier
replied
i
went
with
an
open
mind
i
have
come
back
convinced
that
we
shall
be
at
war
with
germany
within
a
couple
of
the
duke
nodded
vigorously
our
young
friend
is
right
he
declared
three
times
a
week
for
many
months
i
have
been
drumming
the
fact
into
the
handful
of
englishmen
who
have
deigned
to
come
to
our
meetings
i
have
made
myself
a
nuisance
to
the
house
of
lords
and
the
press
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
realise
how
hard
it
is
to
make
an
englishman
reflect
so
long
as
he
is
making
money
and
having
a
good
you
are
just
back
from
africa
everard
within
a
week
did
you
see
anything
of
the
germans
out
there
were
you
anywhere
near
their
colony
i
have
been
in
touch
with
them
for
some
years
dominey
replied
most
interesting
his
questioner
exclaimed
you
may
be
of
service
to
us
everard
you
may
indeed
now
tell
me
is
it
true
that
they
have
secret
agents
out
there
trying
to
provoke
unsettlement
and
disquiet
amongst
the
boers
is
it
true
that
they
apprehend
a
war
with
england
before
very
long
and
are
determined
to
stir
up
the
colony
against
us
i
am
very
sorry
dominey
replied
but
i
am
not
a
politician
in
any
shape
or
form
all
the
germans
whom
i
have
met
out
there
seem
a
most
peaceful
race
of
men
and
there
does
seem
to
be
the
slightest
discontent
amongst
the
boers
or
any
one
the
duke
face
fell
this
is
very
the
only
people
who
seem
to
have
any
cause
for
discontent
dominey
continued
are
the
english
settlers
i
did
commence
to
do
any
good
myself
there
till
a
few
years
ago
but
i
have
heard
some
queer
stories
about
the
way
our
own
people
were
treated
after
the
what
you
say
about
south
africa
sir
everard
the
young
soldier
remarked
is
naturally
interesting
but
i
am
bound
to
say
that
it
is
in
direct
opposition
to
all
i
have
and
i
the
duke
echoed
fervently
i
have
lived
there
for
the
last
eleven
years
dominey
continued
and
although
i
spent
the
earlier
part
of
that
time
trekking
after
big
game
lately
i
am
bound
to
confess
that
every
thought
and
energy
i
possess
have
been
centered
upon
for
that
reason
perhaps
my
observations
may
have
been
at
fault
i
shall
claim
the
privilege
of
coming
to
one
of
your
first
meetings
duke
and
of
trying
to
understand
this
his
august
connection
blinked
at
him
a
little
curiously
for
a
moment
behind
his
glasses
my
dear
everard
he
said
forgive
my
remarking
it
but
i
find
you
more
changed
than
i
could
have
believed
everard
is
changed
in
more
ways
than
one
his
wife
observed
with
faint
irony
dominey
who
had
risen
to
leave
bent
over
her
hand
what
about
my
dinner
party
sir
she
added
as
soon
as
i
return
from
norfolk
he
replied
dominey
hall
will
really
find
you
she
asked
a
little
curiously
most
certainly
there
was
again
that
little
flutter
of
fear
in
her
eyes
followed
by
a
momentary
flash
of
admiration
dominey
shook
hands
gravely
with
his
host
and
nodded
to
bertram
the
servant
whom
the
duchess
had
summoned
stood
holding
the
curtains
on
one
side
i
shall
hope
to
see
you
again
shortly
duke
dominey
said
as
he
completed
his
there
is
a
little
matter
of
business
to
be
adjusted
between
us
you
will
probably
hear
from
mangan
in
a
day
or
the
duke
gazed
after
the
retreating
figure
of
this
very
amazing
visitor
when
the
curtains
had
fallen
he
turned
to
his
wife
a
little
matter
of
business
he
repeated
i
hope
you
have
explained
to
everard
my
dear
that
although
of
course
we
are
very
glad
to
see
him
back
again
it
is
absolutely
hopeless
for
him
to
look
to
me
for
any
financial
assistance
at
the
present
caroline
smiled
everard
was
alluding
to
the
money
he
already
owes
you
she
explained
he
intends
to
repay
it
at
once
he
is
also
paying
off
the
dominey
mortgages
he
has
apparently
made
a
fortune
in
the
duke
collapsed
into
an
everard
pay
his
debts
he
exclaimed
everard
dominey
pay
off
the
mortgages
that
is
what
i
understand
his
wife
acquiesced
the
duke
clutched
at
the
last
refuge
of
a
weak
but
obstinate
man
his
mouth
came
together
like
a
there
something
wrong
about
it
somewhere
he
declared
chapter
vi
dominey
spent
a
very
impatient
hour
that
evening
in
his
at
the
carlton
waiting
for
seaman
it
was
not
until
nearly
seven
that
the
latter
appeared
are
you
aware
dominey
asked
him
that
i
am
expected
to
call
upon
the
princess
eiderstrom
at
seven
i
have
your
word
for
it
seaman
replied
but
i
see
no
tragedy
in
the
situation
the
princess
is
a
woman
of
sense
and
a
woman
of
political
insight
while
i
can
not
recommend
you
to
take
her
entirely
into
your
confidence
i
still
think
that
a
middle
course
can
be
judiciously
rubbish
dominey
exclaimed
as
leopold
von
ragastein
the
princess
has
indisputable
claims
upon
me
and
my
liberty
claims
which
would
altogether
interfere
with
the
career
of
everard
with
methodical
neatness
seaman
laid
his
hat
gloves
and
walking
stick
upon
the
sideboard
he
then
looked
into
the
connecting
bedroom
closed
and
fastened
the
door
and
extended
himself
in
an
sit
opposite
to
me
my
friend
he
said
we
will
talk
dominey
obeyed
a
little
sullenly
his
companion
however
ignored
his
demeanour
now
my
friend
he
said
beating
upon
the
palm
of
one
hand
with
the
forefinger
of
his
other
i
am
a
man
of
commerce
and
i
do
things
in
a
business
way
let
us
take
stock
of
our
position
three
months
ago
this
very
week
we
met
by
appointment
at
a
certain
hotel
in
cape
only
three
months
dominey
muttered
we
were
unknown
to
one
another
seaman
continued
i
had
only
heard
of
the
baron
von
ragastein
as
a
devoted
german
citizen
and
patriot
engaged
in
an
important
enterprise
in
east
africa
by
special
intercession
of
the
kaiser
on
account
of
a
certain
unfortunate
happening
in
i
killed
a
man
in
a
duel
dominey
said
slowly
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
his
companion
it
was
not
an
unforgivable
there
are
duels
and
duels
a
fight
between
two
young
men
in
defence
of
the
honour
of
or
to
gain
the
favour
of
a
young
lady
in
their
own
station
of
life
has
never
been
against
the
conventions
of
the
court
on
the
other
hand
to
become
the
lover
of
the
wife
of
one
of
the
greatest
nobles
in
hungary
and
to
secure
possession
by
killing
the
husband
in
the
duel
which
his
honour
makes
a
necessity
is
looked
upon
very
i
had
no
wish
to
kill
the
prince
dominey
protested
nor
was
it
at
my
desire
that
we
met
at
all
the
prince
fought
like
a
madman
and
slipped
after
a
wild
lunge
on
to
the
point
of
my
stationary
let
that
pass
seaman
said
i
am
not
of
your
order
and
i
probably
do
not
understand
the
etiquette
of
these
matters
i
simply
look
upon
you
as
a
culprit
in
the
eyes
of
our
master
and
i
feel
that
he
has
a
right
to
demand
from
you
much
in
the
way
of
personal
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
dominey
demanded
what
more
he
would
have
i
have
spent
weary
years
in
a
godless
and
country
raising
up
for
our
arms
a
great
troop
of
natives
i
have
undertaken
other
political
commissions
in
the
colony
which
may
bear
fruit
i
am
to
take
up
the
work
for
which
i
was
originally
intended
for
which
i
was
given
an
english
education
i
am
to
repair
to
england
and
under
such
identity
as
i
might
assume
after
consultation
with
you
at
cape
town
i
am
to
render
myself
so
far
as
possible
a
in
that
country
i
do
not
wait
for
our
meeting
i
see
a
great
chance
and
i
make
use
of
it
i
transform
myself
into
an
english
country
gentleman
and
i
think
you
will
admit
that
i
have
done
so
with
great
all
that
you
say
is
granted
seaman
agreed
you
met
me
at
cape
town
in
your
new
identity
and
you
certainly
seemed
to
wear
it
wonderfully
you
have
made
it
uncommonly
expensive
but
we
do
not
grudge
i
could
not
return
home
to
a
domain
dominey
pointed
out
i
should
have
held
no
place
whatever
in
english
social
life
and
i
should
have
received
no
welcome
from
those
with
whom
i
imagine
you
desire
me
to
stand
again
i
make
no
complaints
seaman
declared
there
is
no
bottom
to
our
purse
nor
any
stint
neither
must
there
be
any
stint
to
our
loyalty
he
added
gravely
in
this
instance
dominey
protested
it
is
not
a
matter
of
loyalty
everard
dominey
can
not
throw
himself
at
the
feet
of
the
princess
eiderstrom
to
be
one
of
the
most
passionate
women
in
europe
whilst
her
love
affair
with
leopold
von
ragastein
is
still
remembered
remember
that
the
question
of
our
identities
might
crop
up
any
day
we
were
friends
over
here
in
england
at
school
and
at
college
and
there
are
many
who
still
remember
the
likeness
between
us
perfectly
though
i
may
play
my
part
here
and
there
there
may
be
doubts
there
will
be
doubts
no
longer
if
i
am
to
be
dragged
at
the
chariot
wheels
of
the
seaman
was
silent
for
a
moment
there
is
reason
in
what
you
say
he
admitted
presently
it
is
for
a
few
months
only
what
is
your
proposition
that
you
see
the
princess
in
my
place
at
once
dominey
suggested
eagerly
point
out
to
her
that
for
the
present
for
political
reasons
i
am
and
must
remain
everard
dominey
to
her
as
to
the
rest
of
the
world
let
her
be
content
with
such
measure
of
friendship
and
admiration
as
sir
everard
dominey
might
reasonably
offer
to
a
beautiful
woman
whom
he
met
for
the
first
time
and
i
am
entirely
and
with
all
my
heart
at
her
service
but
let
her
remember
that
even
between
us
two
in
the
solitude
of
her
room
as
in
the
where
we
might
meet
it
can
be
everard
dominey
only
until
my
mission
is
ended
you
think
perhaps
that
i
lay
unnecessary
stress
upon
this
i
do
not
i
know
the
princess
and
i
know
seaman
glanced
at
the
clock
at
what
hour
was
your
appointment
it
was
not
an
appointment
it
was
a
command
dominey
replied
i
was
told
to
be
at
belgrave
square
at
seven
i
will
have
an
understanding
with
the
princess
promised
seaman
as
he
took
up
his
hat
dine
with
me
downstairs
at
eight
on
my
dominey
descending
about
an
hour
later
found
his
friend
seaman
already
established
at
a
small
table
set
in
one
of
the
recesses
of
the
grill
room
he
was
welcomed
with
a
little
wave
of
the
hand
and
cocktails
were
at
once
ordered
i
have
done
your
errand
seaman
announced
since
my
visit
i
am
bound
to
admit
that
i
realise
a
little
more
fully
your
you
probably
had
not
met
the
princess
before
i
had
not
i
must
confess
that
i
found
her
a
lady
of
somewhat
overpowering
temperament
i
fancy
my
young
friend
seaman
continued
with
a
twitch
at
the
corner
of
his
lips
that
somewhere
about
august
next
year
you
will
find
your
hands
august
next
year
can
take
care
of
itself
was
the
cool
reply
in
the
meantime
seaman
continued
the
princess
understands
the
situation
and
is
i
think
impressed
she
will
at
any
rate
do
nothing
rash
you
and
she
will
meet
within
the
course
of
the
next
few
hours
but
on
reasonable
terms
to
proceed
as
i
drove
back
here
after
my
interview
with
the
princess
i
decided
that
it
was
time
you
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
person
who
is
chiefly
responsible
for
your
presence
terniloff
precisely
you
have
maintained
my
young
friend
seaman
went
on
after
a
brief
pause
during
which
one
waiter
had
brought
their
cocktails
and
another
received
their
order
for
dinner
a
very
discreet
and
laudable
silence
with
regard
to
those
further
instructions
which
were
promised
to
you
immediately
you
should
arrive
in
london
those
instructions
will
never
be
committed
to
writing
they
are
seaman
touched
his
forehead
and
drained
the
remaining
contents
of
his
glass
my
instructions
are
to
trust
you
absolutely
dominey
observed
and
until
the
greater
events
stir
to
concentrate
the
greater
part
of
my
energies
in
leading
the
natural
life
of
the
man
whose
name
and
place
i
have
quite
so
seaman
acquiesced
he
glanced
around
the
room
for
a
moment
or
two
as
though
interested
in
the
people
satisfied
at
last
that
there
was
no
chance
of
being
overheard
he
continued
the
first
idea
you
have
to
get
out
of
your
head
my
dear
friend
if
it
is
there
is
that
you
are
a
spy
you
are
nothing
of
the
sort
you
are
not
connected
with
our
remarkably
perfect
system
of
espionage
in
the
slightest
degree
you
are
a
free
agent
in
all
that
you
may
choose
to
say
or
do
you
can
believe
in
germany
or
fear
her
whichever
you
like
you
can
join
your
cousin
husband
in
his
crusade
for
national
service
or
you
can
join
me
in
my
efforts
to
cement
the
bonds
of
friendship
and
affection
between
the
citizens
of
the
two
countries
we
really
do
not
care
in
the
least
choose
your
own
part
give
yourself
thoroughly
into
the
life
of
sir
everard
dominey
baronet
of
dominey
hall
norfolk
and
pursue
exactly
the
course
which
you
think
sir
everard
himself
would
be
likely
to
this
dominey
admitted
is
very
it
is
common
sense
was
the
prompt
reply
with
all
your
ability
you
could
not
in
six
months
time
appreciably
affect
the
position
either
way
therefore
we
choose
to
have
you
concentrate
the
whole
of
your
energies
upon
one
task
and
one
task
only
if
there
is
anything
of
the
spy
about
your
mission
here
it
is
not
england
or
the
english
which
are
to
engage
your
attention
we
require
you
to
concentrate
wholly
and
entirely
upon
dominey
was
startled
terniloff
he
repeated
i
expected
to
work
with
him
but
empty
your
mind
of
all
preconceived
ideas
seaman
enjoined
what
your
duties
are
with
regard
to
terniloff
will
grow
upon
you
gradually
as
the
situation
as
yet
dominey
remarked
i
have
not
even
made
his
i
was
on
the
point
of
telling
you
earlier
in
our
conversation
that
i
have
made
an
appointment
for
you
to
see
him
at
eleven
at
the
embassy
you
will
go
to
him
at
that
hour
remember
you
know
nothing
you
are
waiting
for
instructions
let
speech
remain
with
him
alone
be
particularly
careful
not
to
drop
him
a
hint
of
your
knowledge
of
what
is
coming
you
will
find
him
absolutely
satisfied
with
the
situation
absolutely
content
take
care
not
to
disturb
him
he
is
a
missioner
of
peace
so
are
i
begin
to
understand
dominey
said
thoughtfully
you
shall
understand
everything
when
the
time
comes
for
you
to
take
a
hand
seaman
promised
and
do
not
in
your
zeal
forget
my
friend
that
your
utility
to
our
great
cause
will
depend
largely
upon
your
being
able
to
establish
and
maintain
your
position
as
an
english
gentleman
so
far
all
has
gone
well
perfectly
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
dominey
replied
you
must
remember
though
that
there
is
your
end
to
keep
up
berlin
will
be
receiving
frantic
messages
from
east
africa
as
to
my
disappearance
not
even
my
immediate
associates
were
in
the
that
is
all
understood
seaman
assured
his
companion
a
little
doctor
named
schmidt
has
spent
many
marks
of
the
government
money
in
frantic
cables
you
must
have
endeared
yourself
to
he
was
a
very
faithful
he
has
been
a
very
troublesome
friend
it
seems
that
the
natives
got
their
stories
rather
mixed
up
concerning
your
namesake
who
apparently
died
in
the
bush
and
schmidt
continually
emphasised
your
promise
to
let
him
hear
from
cape
town
however
all
this
has
been
dealt
with
satisfactorily
the
only
real
dangers
are
over
here
and
so
far
you
seem
to
have
encountered
the
principal
i
have
at
any
rate
been
accepted
dominey
declared
by
my
nearest
living
relative
and
incidentally
i
have
discovered
the
one
person
in
england
who
knows
what
is
in
store
for
seaman
was
momentarily
anxious
whom
do
you
mean
the
duke
of
worcester
my
cousin
husband
of
whom
you
were
speaking
just
the
little
man
face
relaxed
he
reminds
me
of
the
geese
who
saved
the
capitol
he
said
a
brainless
man
obsessed
with
one
idea
it
is
queer
how
often
these
fanatics
discover
the
truth
that
reminds
me
he
added
taking
a
small
memorandum
book
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
glancing
it
through
his
grace
has
a
meeting
at
the
holborn
town
hall
i
shall
make
one
of
my
usual
if
he
has
so
small
a
following
why
do
you
leave
him
alone
dominey
enquired
there
are
others
associated
with
him
was
the
placid
reply
who
are
not
so
insignificant
besides
when
i
interrupt
i
advertise
my
own
little
these
we
english
are
strange
people
dominey
remarked
glancing
around
the
room
after
a
brief
but
thoughtful
pause
we
advertise
and
boast
about
our
colossal
wealth
and
yet
we
are
incapable
of
the
slightest
in
order
to
preserve
it
one
would
have
imagined
that
our
philosophers
our
historians
would
warn
us
in
irresistible
terms
by
unanswerable
scientific
deduction
of
what
was
my
compliments
to
your
pronouns
seaman
murmured
with
a
little
bow
apropos
of
what
you
were
saying
you
will
never
make
an
englishman
i
beg
your
pardon
one
of
your
countrymen
realise
anything
unpleasant
he
prefers
to
keep
his
head
comfortably
down
in
the
sand
but
to
leave
generalities
when
do
you
think
of
going
to
norfolk
within
the
next
few
days
dominey
replied
i
shall
breathe
more
freely
when
you
are
securely
established
there
his
companion
declared
great
things
wait
upon
your
complete
acceptance
in
the
country
as
well
as
in
town
as
sir
everard
dominey
you
are
sure
that
you
perfectly
understand
your
position
there
as
regards
your
er
domestic
affairs
i
understand
all
that
is
necessary
was
the
somewhat
stiff
reply
all
that
is
necessary
is
not
enough
seaman
rejoined
irritably
i
thought
that
you
had
wormed
the
whole
story
out
of
that
drunken
englishman
he
told
me
most
of
it
there
were
just
one
or
two
points
which
lay
beyond
the
limits
where
questioning
was
seaman
frowned
angrily
in
other
words
he
complained
you
remembered
that
you
were
a
gentleman
and
not
that
you
were
a
the
englishman
of
a
certain
order
dominey
pronounced
even
though
he
be
degenerate
has
a
certain
obstinacy
generally
connected
with
one
particular
thing
which
nothing
can
break
we
talked
together
on
that
last
night
until
morning
we
drank
wine
and
brandy
i
tore
the
story
of
my
own
exile
from
my
breast
and
laid
it
bare
before
him
yet
i
knew
all
the
time
as
i
know
now
that
he
kept
something
there
was
a
brief
pause
during
the
last
few
minutes
a
certain
tension
had
crept
in
between
the
two
men
with
it
their
personal
characteristics
seemed
to
have
become
intensified
dominey
was
more
than
ever
the
aristocrat
seaman
the
plebian
schemer
unabashed
and
desperately
in
earnest
he
leaned
presently
a
little
way
across
the
table
his
eyes
had
narrowed
but
they
were
as
bright
as
steel
his
teeth
were
more
prominent
than
usual
you
should
have
dragged
it
from
his
throat
he
insisted
it
is
not
your
duty
to
nurse
fine
personal
feelings
heart
and
soul
you
stand
pledged
to
great
things
i
can
not
at
this
moment
give
you
any
idea
what
you
may
not
mean
to
us
after
the
trouble
has
come
if
you
are
able
to
play
your
part
still
in
this
country
as
everard
dominey
of
dominey
hall
i
know
well
enough
that
the
sense
of
personal
honour
amongst
the
prussian
aristocracy
is
the
finest
in
the
world
and
yet
there
is
not
a
single
man
of
your
order
who
should
not
be
prepared
to
lie
or
cheat
for
his
country
sake
you
must
fall
into
line
with
your
fellows
once
more
it
is
not
only
your
task
with
regard
to
terniloff
which
makes
your
recognition
as
everard
dominey
so
important
to
us
it
is
the
things
which
are
to
come
come
enough
of
this
subject
i
know
that
you
understand
we
grow
too
serious
how
shall
you
spend
your
evening
until
eleven
remember
you
did
not
leave
england
an
anchorite
sir
everard
you
must
have
your
amusements
why
not
try
a
music
hall
my
mind
is
too
full
of
other
things
dominey
objected
then
come
with
me
to
holborn
the
little
man
suggested
it
will
amuse
you
we
will
part
at
the
door
and
you
shall
sit
at
the
back
of
the
hall
out
of
sight
you
shall
hear
the
haunting
eloquence
of
your
you
shall
hear
him
trying
to
warn
the
men
and
women
of
england
of
the
danger
awaiting
them
from
the
great
and
rapacious
german
nation
what
do
you
say
i
will
come
dominey
replied
in
spiritless
fashion
it
will
be
better
than
a
music
hall
at
any
rate
i
am
not
at
all
sure
seaman
that
the
hardest
part
of
my
task
over
here
will
not
be
this
necessity
for
his
companion
struck
the
table
gently
but
impatiently
with
his
clenched
fist
man
you
are
young
he
exclaimed
you
are
like
the
rest
of
us
you
carry
your
life
in
your
hands
do
nourish
past
griefs
cast
the
memory
of
them
away
there
nothing
which
narrows
a
man
more
than
morbidness
you
have
a
past
which
may
sometimes
bring
the
ghosts
around
you
but
remember
the
sin
was
not
wholly
yours
and
there
is
an
atonement
which
in
measured
fashion
you
may
commence
whenever
you
please
i
have
said
enough
about
that
greatness
and
gaiety
go
hand
in
hand
there
you
see
i
was
a
philosopher
before
i
became
a
professor
of
propaganda
good
you
smile
that
is
something
gained
at
any
rate
now
we
will
take
a
taxicab
to
holborn
and
i
will
show
you
something
really
at
the
entrance
to
the
town
hall
the
two
men
at
seaman
instigation
parted
making
their
way
inside
by
different
doors
dominey
found
a
retired
seat
under
a
balcony
where
he
was
unlikely
to
be
recognised
from
the
platform
seaman
on
the
other
hand
took
up
a
more
prominent
position
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
front
rows
of
benches
the
meeting
was
by
no
means
overcrowded
there
were
rows
of
empty
benches
a
good
many
young
couples
who
seemed
to
have
come
in
for
shelter
from
the
inclement
night
a
few
sturdy
tradesmen
who
had
come
because
it
seemed
to
be
the
respectable
thing
to
do
a
few
genuinely
interested
and
here
and
there
although
they
were
decidedly
in
the
minority
a
sprinkling
of
enthusiasts
on
the
platform
was
the
duke
with
civic
dignitaries
on
either
side
of
him
a
distinguished
soldier
a
member
of
parliament
a
or
so
of
nondescript
residents
from
the
neighbourhood
and
captain
bartram
the
meeting
was
on
the
point
of
commencement
as
dominey
settled
down
in
his
corner
first
of
all
the
duke
rose
and
in
a
few
hackneyed
but
earnest
sentences
introduced
his
young
friend
captain
bartram
the
latter
who
sprang
at
once
into
the
middle
of
his
subject
was
nervous
and
more
than
a
little
bitter
he
explained
that
he
had
resigned
his
commission
and
was
therefore
free
to
speak
his
mind
he
spoke
of
enormous
military
preparations
in
germany
and
a
general
air
of
tense
expectation
against
whom
were
these
preparations
without
an
earthly
doubt
against
greatest
rival
whose
millions
of
young
men
even
in
this
hour
of
danger
preferred
playing
or
watching
football
or
cricket
on
saturday
afternoons
to
realising
their
duty
the
conclusion
of
an
but
earnest
speech
was
punctuated
by
the
furtive
entrance
into
the
hall
of
a
small
boy
selling
evening
newspapers
and
there
was
a
temporary
diversion
from
any
interest
in
the
proceedings
on
the
part
of
the
younger
portion
of
the
audience
whilst
they
satisfied
themselves
as
to
the
result
of
various
cup
ties
the
member
of
parliament
then
descended
upon
them
in
a
whirlwind
of
oratory
and
in
his
best
house
of
commons
style
he
spoke
of
black
clouds
and
of
the
cold
breeze
that
went
before
the
coming
thunderstorm
he
pointed
to
the
collapse
of
every
great
nation
throughout
history
who
had
neglected
the
arts
of
he
appealed
to
the
youth
of
the
nation
to
prepare
themselves
to
guard
their
womenkind
their
homes
the
sacred
soil
of
their
country
and
at
that
point
was
interrupted
by
a
drowsy
member
of
the
audience
with
stentorian
lungs
who
seemed
just
at
that
moment
to
have
waked
up
what
about
the
navy
the
orator
swept
upon
the
interrupter
in
his

he
declared
could
be
trusted
at
all
times
to

its

it
could
not

would
the
young
man
who
had
just
interrupted
do
his
and
enroll
his
name
for
drill
and

that
evening
and
so

who
was
suffering
from
a
cold
fired
off
a
few
husky
sentences
only
to
the
tune
of
rounds
of
applause
the
proceedings
were
wound
up
by
the
duke
who
was
obviously
with
the
exception
of
the
distinguished
soldier
much
more
in
earnest
than
any
of
them
and
secured
upon
the
whole
a
respectful
attention
he
brought
in
a
few
historical
allusions
pleaded
for
a
greater
spirit
of
earnestness
and
citizenship
amongst
the

appealed
even
to
the
women
to
develop
their

sat
down
amidst
a
little
burst
of
quite
enthusiastic
the
vote
of
thanks
to
the
chairman
was
on
the
point
of
being
proposed
when
mr
seaman
standing
up
in
his
place
appealed
to
the
chairman
for
permission
to
say
a
few
words
the
duke
who
had
had
some
experience
with
mr
seaman
before
looked
at
him
severely
but
the
smile
with
which
mr
seaman
looked
around
upon
the
audience
was
so
and
attractive
that
he
had
no
alternative
but
to
assent
seaman
scrambled
up
the
steps
on
to
the
platform
coughed
apologetically
bowed
to
the
duke
and
took
possession
of
the
meeting
after
a
word
or
two
of
compliment
to
the
chairman
he
made
his
confession
he
was
a
german
citizen
he
was
indeed
one
of
that
bloodthirsty
race
some
laughter
he
was
also
and
it
was
his
excuse
for
standing
there
the
founder
and
secretary
of
a
league
doubtless
well
known
to
them
a
league
for
promoting
more
friendly
relations
between
the
business
men
of
germany
and
england
some
of
the
remarks
which
he
had
heard
that
evening
had
pained
him
deeply
business
often
took
him
to
germany
and
as
a
german
he
would
be
doing
less
than
his
duty
if
he
did
not
stand
up
there
and
tell
them
that
the
average
german
loved
the
englishman
like
a
brother
that
the
object
of
his
life
was
to
come
into
greater
kinship
with
him
that
germany
even
at
that
moment
was
standing
with
hand
outstretched
to
her
relatives
across
the
north
sea
begging
for
a
deeper
sympathy
begging
for
a
larger
understanding
applause
from
the
audience
murmurs
of
dissent
from
the
platform
and
as
to
those
military
preparations
of
which
they
had
heard
so
much
with
a
severe
glance
at
captain
bartram
let
them
glance
for
one
moment
at
the
frontiers
of
germany
let
them
realise
that
eastwards
germany
was
being
continually
pressed
by
an
ancient
and
historic
foe
of
enormous
strength
he
would
not
waste
their
time
telling
them
of
the
political
difficulties
which
germany
had
had
to
face
during
the
last
generation
he
would
simply
tell
them
this
great
truth
the
foe
for
whom
germany
was
obliged
to
make
these
great
military
preparations
was
russia
if
ever
they
were
used
it
would
be
against
russia
and
at
in
his
humble
way
he
was
striving
for
the
betterment
of
relations
between
the
dearly
beloved
country
of
his
birth
and
the
equally
beloved
country
of
his
adoption
such
meetings
as
these
instituted
as
it
seemed
to
him
for
the
propagation
of
unfair
and
unjustified
suspicions
were
one
of
the
greatest
difficulties
in
his
way
he
could
not
for
a
moment
doubt
that
these
gentlemen
upon
the
platform
were
patriots
they
would
prove
it
more
profitably
both
to
themselves
and
their
country
if
they
abandoned
their
present
prejudiced
and
harmful
campaign
and
became
patrons
of
his
society
seaman
little
bow
to
the
chairman
was
tolerant
a
little
wistful
the
duke
few
words
prefaced
by
an
indignant
protest
against
the
intrusion
of
a
german
propagandist
into
an
english
patriotic
meeting
did
nothing
to
undo
the
effect
produced
by
this
undesired
stranger
when
the
meeting
broke
up
it
was
doubtful
whether
a
single
adherent
had
been
gained
to
the
cause
of
national
service
the
duke
went
home
full
of
wrath
and
seaman
chuckled
with
genuine
merriment
as
he
stepped
into
the
taxi
which
dominey
had
secured
at
the
corner
of
the
street
i
promised
you
entertainment
he
observed
confess
that
i
have
kept
my
dominey
smiled
enigmatically
you
certainly
succeeded
in
making
fools
of
a
number
of
respectable
and
the
miracle
of
it
extends
further
seaman
agreed
in
its
small
way
is
a
supreme
example
of
the
transcendental
follies
of
democracy
england
is
being
slowly
choked
and
strangled
with
too
much
liberty
she
is
like
a
child
being
overfed
with
jam
imagine
in
our
dear
country
an
englishman
being
allowed
to
mount
the
platform
and
spout
undisturbed
english
propaganda
in
deadly
opposition
to
german
interests
the
liberty
of
the
englishman
is
like
the
cuckoo
in
his
political
nest
countries
must
be
governed
they
can
not
govern
themselves
the
time
of
war
will
prove
all
yet
in
any
great
crisis
of
a
nation
history
dominey
queried
surely
there
is
safety
in
a
multitude
of
counsellors
there
would
be
always
a
multitude
of
counsellors
seaman
replied
in
germany
as
in
england
the
trouble
for
this
country
is
that
they
would
be
all
expressed
publicly
and
in
the
press
each
view
would
have
its
adherents
and
the
government
be
split
up
into
factions
in
germany
the
real
destinies
of
the
country
are
decided
in
secret
there
are
counsellors
there
too
earnest
and
wise
counsellors
but
no
one
knows
their
varying
views
all
that
one
learns
is
the
result
spoken
through
the
lips
of
the
kaiser
spoken
once
and
for
dominey
was
showing
signs
of
a
rare
interest
in
his
conversation
his
eyes
were
bright
his
usually
impassive
features
seemed
to
have
become
more
mobile
and
strained
he
laid
his
hand
on
seaman
arm
listen
he
said
we
are
in
london
alone
in
a
taxicab
secure
against
any
possible
eavesdropping
you
preach
the
advantage
of
our
country
do
you
really
believe
that
the
kaiser
is
the
man
for
the
task
which
is
coming
seaman
narrow
eyes
glittered
he
looked
at
his
companion
in
satisfaction
his
forehead
was
puckered
his
eternal
smile
gone
he
was
the
man
of
intellect
so
you
are
waking
up
from
the
lethargy
of
africa
my
friend
he
exclaimed
you
are
beginning
to
think
as
you
ask
me
so
shall
i
answer
the
kaiser
is
a
vain
bombastic
dreamer
the
greatest
egotist
who
ever
lived
with
a
diseased
personality
a
ceaseless
craving
for
the
limelight
but
he
has
also
the
genius
for
government
i
mean
this
he
is
a
splendid
medium
for
the
expression
of
the
brain
power
of
his
counsellors
their
words
will
pass
through
his
personality
and
he
will
believe
them
his
what
is
more
they
will
sound
like
his
he
will
see
himself
the
knight
in
shining
armour
all
europe
will
bow
down
before
this
caesar
and
no
one
except
we
who
are
behind
will
realise
the
ass
head
there
is
no
one
else
in
this
world
whom
i
have
ever
met
so
well
fitted
to
lead
our
great
nation
on
to
the
destiny
she
and
now
my
friend
if
you
like
we
will
speak
of
these
matters
again
you
have
other
things
to
think
about
you
are
going
into
the
great
places
where
i
never
penetrate
you
have
an
hour
to
change
and
prepare
at
eleven
the
prince
von
terniloff
will
expect
chapter
vii
there
had
been
a
dinner
party
and
a
very
small
reception
afterwards
at
the
great
embassy
in
carlton
house
terrace
the
ambassador
prince
terniloff
was
bidding
farewell
to
his
wife
cousin
the
princess
eiderstrom
the
last
of
his
guests
she
drew
him
on
one
side
for
a
moment
your
excellency
she
said
i
have
been
hoping
for
a
word
with
you
all
the
and
i
with
you
dear
stephanie
he
answered
it
is
very
early
let
us
sit
down
for
a
he
led
her
towards
a
settee
but
she
shook
her
head
you
have
an
appointment
at
eleven
she
said
i
wish
you
to
keep
you
know
then
i
lunched
at
the
carleton
grill
room
in
the
i
came
face
to
face
with
leopold
von
the
ambassador
made
no
remark
it
seemed
to
be
his
wish
to
hear
first
all
that
his
companion
had
to
say
after
a
moment
pause
she
continued
i
spoke
to
him
and
he
denied
himself
to
me
i
think
that
those
were
the
most
terrible
seconds
of
my
life
i
have
never
suffered
more
i
shall
never
suffer
so
much
it
was
most
unfortunate
the
prince
murmured
sympathetically
this
evening
she
went
on
i
received
a
visit
from
a
man
whom
i
took
at
first
to
be
an
insignificant
member
of
the
german
bourgeoisie
i
learnt
something
of
his
true
position
later
he
came
to
me
to
explain
that
leopold
was
engaged
in
this
country
on
secret
service
that
he
was
passing
under
the
name
which
he
gave
me
sir
everard
dominey
an
english
baronet
long
lost
in
africa
you
know
of
this
i
know
that
i
am
receiving
a
visit
from
sir
everard
he
is
to
work
under
your
auspices
by
no
means
the
prince
rejoined
warmly
i
am
not
favourably
inclined
towards
this
network
of
espionage
the
school
of
diplomacy
in
which
i
have
been
brought
up
tries
to
work
without
such
ignoble
one
realises
that
she
said
leopold
is
coming
however
to
pay
his
respects
to
he
is
waiting
for
me
now
in
my
study
the
ambassador
asserted
you
will
do
me
the
service
of
conveying
to
him
a
message
from
me
she
continued
this
man
seaman
pointed
out
to
me
the
unwisdom
of
any
association
between
myself
and
leopold
under
present
conditions
i
listened
to
all
that
he
had
to
say
i
reserved
my
decision
i
have
now
considered
the
matter
i
will
compromise
with
necessity
i
will
be
content
with
the
acquaintance
of
sir
everard
dominey
but
that
i
will
for
myself
the
ambassador
reflected
i
do
not
even
know
what
von
ragastein
mission
over
here
is
but
if
in
berlin
they
decide
that
for
the
more
complete
preservation
of
his
incognito
association
between
you
and
him
is
undesirable
she
laid
her
fingers
upon
his
arm
stop
she
ordered
i
am
not
of
berlin
i
am
not
a
german
i
am
not
even
an
austrian
i
am
hungarian
and
though
i
am
willing
to
study
your
interests
i
am
not
willing
to
place
them
before
my
own
life
i
make
terms
but
i
do
not
surrender
those
terms
i
will
discuss
with
leopold
ah
be
kind
to
me
she
went
on
with
a
sudden
change
of
voice
since
these
few
minutes
at
midday
i
have
lived
in
a
dream
only
one
thing
can
quiet
me
i
must
speak
to
him
i
must
decide
with
him
what
i
will
do
you
will
help
an
acquaintance
between
you
and
sir
everard
dominey
he
admitted
is
certainly
a
perfectly
natural
look
at
me
she
begged
he
turned
and
looked
into
her
face
underneath
her
beautiful
eyes
were
dark
lines
there
was
something
pitiful
about
the
curve
of
her
mouth
he
remembered
that
although
she
had
carried
herself
throughout
the
evening
with
all
the
dignity
which
was
second
nature
to
her
he
had
overheard
more
than
one
sympathetic
comment
upon
her
appearance
i
can
see
that
you
are
suffering
he
remarked
kindly
my
eyes
are
hot
and
inside
i
am
on
fire
she
continued
i
must
speak
to
leopold
freda
has
asked
me
to
stay
and
talk
to
her
for
an
hour
my
car
waits
arrange
that
he
drives
me
home
oh
believe
me
dear
friend
i
am
a
very
human
woman
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
to
be
gained
by
treating
me
as
though
i
were
of
wood
or
stone
i
can
see
him
without
observation
if
you
refuse
i
shall
take
other
means
i
will
make
no
promises
i
will
not
even
promise
that
i
will
not
call
out
before
him
in
the
streets
that
he
is
a
liar
that
his
life
is
a
lie
i
will
call
him
leopold
von
ragastein
hush
he
begged
her
stephanie
you
are
nervous
i
have
not
yet
answered
your
you
consent
i
consent
he
promised
after
our
interview
i
shall
bring
the
young
man
to
freda
room
and
present
him
you
will
be
there
he
can
offer
you
his
she
suddenly
stooped
and
kissed
his
hand
an
immense
relief
was
in
her
face
now
i
will
keep
you
no
longer
freda
is
waiting
for
the
ambassador
strolled
thoughtfully
away
into
his
own
den
at
the
back
of
the
house
where
dominey
was
waiting
for
him
i
am
glad
to
see
you
the
former
said
holding
out
his
hand
for
five
minutes
i
desire
to
talk
to
your
real
self
after
that
for
the
rest
of
your
time
in
england
i
will
respect
your
new
dominey
bowed
in
silence
his
host
pointed
to
the
sideboard
come
he
continued
there
are
cigars
and
cigarettes
at
your
elbow
whisky
and
soda
on
the
sideboard
make
yourself
at
home
in
that
chair
there
africa
has
really
changed
you
very
little
do
you
remember
our
previous
meeting
in
saxony
i
remember
it
perfectly
your
his
majesty
knew
how
to
keep
court
in
those
days
the
ambassador
went
on
one
was
tempted
to
believe
oneself
at
an
english
country
party
however
that
much
of
the
past
you
know
of
course
that
i
entirely
disapprove
of
your
present
position
here
i
gathered
as
much
your
we
will
have
no
reserves
with
one
another
the
prince
declared
lighting
a
cigar
i
know
quite
well
that
you
form
part
of
a
network
of
espionage
in
this
country
which
i
consider
wholly
unnecessary
that
is
simply
a
question
of
method
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
are
here
with
the
same
object
as
i
am
the
object
which
the
kaiser
has
declared
to
me
with
his
own
lips
is
nearest
to
his
heart
to
cement
the
bonds
of
friendship
between
germany
and
you
believe
sir
that
that
is
possible
i
am
convinced
of
it
was
the
earnest
reply
i
do
not
know
what
the
exact
nature
of
your
work
over
here
is
to
be
but
i
am
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
of
putting
before
you
my
convictions
i
believe
that
in
berlin
the
character
of
some
of
the
leading
statesmen
here
has
been
misunderstood
and
misrepresented
i
find
on
all
sides
of
me
an
earnest
and
sincere
desire
for
peace
i
have
convinced
myself
that
there
is
not
a
single
statesman
in
this
country
who
is
desirous
of
war
with
dominey
was
listening
intently
with
the
air
of
one
who
hears
unexpected
things
but
your
excellency
he
ventured
what
about
the
matter
from
our
point
of
view
there
are
a
great
many
in
our
country
whom
you
and
i
know
of
who
look
forward
to
a
war
with
england
as
inevitable
germany
must
become
we
all
believe
the
greatest
empire
in
the
world
she
must
climb
there
as
one
of
our
friends
once
said
with
her
foot
upon
the
neck
of
the
british
you
are
out
of
date
the
ambassador
declared
earnestly
i
see
now
why
they
sent
you
to
me
those
days
have
passed
there
is
room
in
the
world
for
great
britain
and
for
germany
the
disintegration
of
russia
in
the
near
future
is
a
certainty
it
is
eastward
that
we
must
look
for
any
great
extension
of
these
things
have
been
decided
absolutely
they
form
the
soul
of
my
mission
here
my
mandate
is
one
of
peace
and
the
more
i
see
of
english
statesmen
and
the
more
i
understand
the
british
outlook
the
more
sanguine
i
am
as
to
the
success
of
my
efforts
this
is
why
all
this
outside
espionage
with
which
seaman
is
so
largely
concerned
seems
to
me
at
times
unwise
and
and
my
own
mission
dominey
enquired
its
nature
the
prince
replied
is
not
as
yet
divulged
but
if
as
i
have
been
given
to
understand
it
is
to
become
closely
connected
with
my
own
then
i
am
very
sure
you
will
presently
find
that
its
text
also
is
dominey
rose
to
his
feet
prepared
to
take
his
leave
these
matters
will
be
solved
for
us
he
murmured
there
is
just
one
word
more
on
a
somewhat
more
private
matter
terniloff
said
in
an
altered
tone
the
princess
eiderstrom
is
in
this
house
waiting
for
a
word
with
you
our
friend
seaman
has
been
with
her
this
evening
i
understand
that
she
is
content
to
subscribe
to
the
present
situation
she
makes
one
condition
and
that
she
insists
upon
it
that
i
present
sir
everard
the
latter
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
his
perturbation
i
need
scarcely
point
out
to
you
sir
he
protested
that
any
association
between
the
princess
and
myself
is
likely
to
largely
increase
the
difficulties
of
my
position
the
ambassador
sighed
i
quite
appreciate
that
he
admitted
both
seaman
and
i
have
endeavoured
to
reason
with
her
but
as
you
are
doubtless
aware
the
princess
is
a
woman
of
very
strong
will
she
is
also
very
powerfully
placed
here
and
it
is
the
urgent
desire
of
the
court
at
berlin
to
placate
in
every
way
the
hungarian
nobility
you
will
understand
of
course
that
i
speak
from
a
political
point
of
view
only
i
can
not
ignore
the
fact
of
your
unfortunate
relations
with
the
late
prince
but
in
considering
the
present
position
you
will
i
am
sure
remember
the
greater
his
visitor
was
silent
for
a
moment
you
say
that
the
princess
is
waiting
here
she
is
with
my
wife
and
asks
for
your
escort
home
my
wife
also
looks
forward
to
the
pleasure
of
renewing
her
acquaintance
with
i
shall
accept
your
excellency
guidance
in
the
matter
dominey
decided
the
princess
terniloff
was
a
woman
of
world
culture
an
artist
and
still
an
extremely
attractive
woman
she
received
the
visitor
whom
her
husband
brought
to
her
in
a
very
charming
little
room
furnished
after
the
style
of
the
simplest
french
period
and
she
did
her
best
to
relieve
the
strain
of
what
she
understood
must
be
a
somewhat
trying
moment
we
are
delighted
to
welcome
you
to
london
sir
everard
dominey
she
said
taking
his
hand
and
i
hope
that
we
shall
often
see
you
here
i
want
to
present
you
to
my
cousin
who
is
interested
in
you
i
must
tell
you
frankly
because
of
your
likeness
to
a
very
dear
friend
of
hers
stephanie
this
is
sir
everard
dominey
the
princess
stephanie
who
was
seated
upon
the
couch
from
which
her
cousin
had
just
risen
held
out
her
hand
to
dominey
who
made
her
a
very
low
and
formal
bow
her
gown
was
of
unrelieved
black
wonderful
diamonds
flashed
around
her
neck
and
she
wore
also
a
tiara
fashioned
after
the
hungarian
style
a
little
low
on
her
forehead
her
manner
and
tone
still
indicated
some
measure
of
rebellion
against
the
situation
you
have
forgiven
me
for
my
insistence
this
morning
she
asked
it
was
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
you
were
not
indeed
the
person
for
whom
i
mistook
other
people
have
spoken
to
me
of
the
likeness
dominey
replied
it
is
a
matter
of
regret
to
me
that
i
can
claim
to
be
no
more
than
a
simple
norfolk
without
any
previous
experience
of
european
courts
without
any
at
your
german
is
wonderfully
pure
for
an
untravelled
languages
were
the
sole
accomplishment
i
brought
away
from
my
misspent
school
you
are
not
going
to
bury
yourself
in
norfolk
sir
everard
the
princess
terniloff
enquired
norfolk
is
very
near
london
these
days
dominey
replied
and
i
have
experienced
more
than
my
share
of
solitude
during
the
last
few
years
i
hope
to
spend
a
portion
of
my
time
you
must
dine
with
us
one
night
the
princess
insisted
and
tell
us
about
africa
my
husband
would
be
so
you
are
very
stephanie
rose
slowly
to
her
feet
leaned
gracefully
over
and
kissed
her
hostess
on
both
cheeks
and
submitted
her
hand
to
the
prince
who
raised
it
to
his
lips
then
she
turned
to
dominey
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
see
me
home
she
asked
afterwards
my
car
can
take
you
on
wherever
you
choose
to
i
shall
be
very
happy
dominey
assented
he
too
made
his
farewells
a
servant
in
the
hall
handed
him
his
hat
and
coat
and
he
took
his
place
in
the
car
by
stephanie
side
she
touched
the
electric
switch
as
they
glided
off
the
car
was
in
darkness
i
think
she
murmured
that
i
could
not
have
borne
another
moment
of
this
juggling
with
words
leopold
we
are
alone
he
caught
the
flash
of
her
jewels
the
soft
brilliance
of
her
eyes
as
she
leaned
towards
him
his
voice
sounded
even
to
himself
harsh
and
strident
you
mistake
princess
my
name
is
not
leopold
i
am
everard
oh
i
know
that
you
are
very
obstinate
she
said
softly
very
obstinate
and
very
devoted
to
your
marvellous
country
but
you
have
a
soul
leopold
you
know
that
there
are
human
duties
as
great
as
any
your
country
ever
imposed
upon
you
you
know
what
i
look
for
from
you
what
i
must
find
from
you
or
go
down
into
hell
ashamed
and
he
felt
his
throat
suddenly
dry
listen
he
muttered
until
the
hour
strikes
i
must
remain
to
you
as
to
the
world
alone
or
in
a
crowd
everard
dominey
there
is
one
way
and
one
way
only
of
carrying
through
my
appointed
she
gave
a
little
hysterical
sob
wait
she
begged
i
will
answer
you
in
a
moment
give
me
your
he
opened
the
fingers
which
he
had
kept
clenched
together
and
he
felt
the
hot
grip
of
her
hand
holding
his
passionately
drawing
it
toward
her
until
the
fingers
of
her
other
hand
too
fell
upon
it
so
she
sat
for
several
moments
leopold
she
continued
presently
i
understand
you
are
afraid
that
i
shall
betray
our
love
you
have
reason
i
am
full
of
impulses
and
passion
as
you
know
but
i
have
restraint
what
we
are
to
one
another
when
we
are
alone
no
soul
in
this
world
need
know
i
will
be
careful
i
swear
it
i
will
never
even
look
at
you
as
though
my
heart
ached
for
your
notice
when
we
are
in
the
presence
of
other
people
you
shall
come
and
see
me
as
seldom
as
you
wish
i
will
receive
you
only
as
often
as
you
say
but
do
treat
me
like
this
tell
me
you
have
come
back
throw
off
this
hideous
mask
if
it
be
only
for
a
he
sat
quite
still
although
her
hands
were
tearing
at
his
her
lips
and
eyes
beseeching
him
whatever
may
come
afterwards
he
pronounced
inexorably
until
the
time
arrives
i
am
everard
dominey
i
can
not
take
advantage
of
your
feelings
for
leopold
von
ragastein
he
is
not
here
he
is
in
africa
perhaps
some
day
he
will
come
back
to
you
and
be
all
that
you
she
flung
his
hands
away
he
felt
her
eyes
burning
into
his
this
time
with
something
more
like
furious
curiosity
let
me
look
at
you
she
cried
let
me
be
sure
is
this
just
some
ghastly
change
or
are
you
an
imposter
my
heart
is
growing
chilled
are
you
the
man
i
have
waited
for
all
these
years
are
you
the
man
to
whom
i
have
given
my
lips
for
whose
sake
i
offered
up
my
reputation
as
a
sacrifice
the
man
who
slew
my
husband
and
left
me
i
was
exiled
he
reminded
her
his
own
voice
shaking
with
emotion
you
know
that
so
far
as
other
things
are
concerned
i
am
exiled
now
i
am
working
out
my
she
leaned
back
in
her
seat
with
an
air
of
exhaustion
her
eyes
closed
then
the
car
drove
in
through
some
iron
gates
and
stopped
in
front
of
her
door
which
was
immediately
opened
a
footman
hurried
out
she
turned
to
dominey
you
will
not
enter
she
pleaded
for
a
short
time
if
you
will
permit
me
to
pay
you
a
visit
it
will
give
me
great
pleasure
he
answered
formally
i
will
call
if
i
may
on
my
return
from
she
gave
him
her
hand
with
a
sad
smile
let
my
people
take
you
wherever
you
want
to
go
she
invited
and
remember
she
added
dropping
her
voice
i
do
not
admit
defeat
this
is
not
the
last
word
between
she
disappeared
in
some
state
escorted
through
the
great
front
door
of
one
of
london
few
palaces
by
an
attractive
and
footman
in
the
livery
of
her
house
dominey
drove
back
to
the
carlton
where
in
the
lounge
he
found
the
band
playing
crowds
still
sitting
around
amongst
whom
seaman
was
conspicuous
in
his
neat
dinner
clothes
and
with
his
cherubic
air
of
inviting
attention
from
prospective
new
acquaintances
he
greeted
dominey
enthusiastically
come
he
exclaimed
i
am
weary
of
solitude
i
have
seen
scarcely
a
face
that
i
recognise
my
tongue
is
parched
with
inaction
i
like
to
talk
and
there
has
been
no
one
to
talk
to
i
might
as
well
have
opened
up
my
little
house
in
forest
i
talk
to
you
if
you
like
dominey
promised
a
little
grimly
glancing
at
the
clock
and
hastily
ordering
a
whisky
and
soda
i
will
begin
by
telling
you
this
he
added
lowering
his
tone
i
have
discovered
the
greatest
danger
i
shall
have
to
face
during
my
what
is
that
a
woman
the
princess
seaman
lit
one
of
his
inevitable
cigars
and
threw
one
of
his
short
fat
legs
over
the
other
he
gazed
for
a
moment
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
at
his
small
foot
neatly
encased
in
court
shoes
you
surprise
me
he
confessed
i
have
considered
the
matter
i
can
not
see
any
great
then
you
must
be
closing
your
eyes
to
it
willfully
dominey
retorted
or
else
you
are
wholly
ignorant
of
the
princess
temperament
and
i
believe
i
appreciate
both
seaman
replied
but
i
still
do
not
see
any
peculiar
difficulty
in
the
situation
as
an
english
nobleman
you
have
a
perfect
right
to
enjoy
the
friendship
of
the
princess
and
i
thought
you
were
a
man
of
sentiment
dominey
scoffed
i
thought
you
understood
a
little
of
human
nature
stephanie
eiderstrom
is
hungarian
born
and
bred
even
race
has
never
taught
her
you
do
seriously
suppose
that
after
all
these
years
after
all
she
has
suffered
and
she
has
suffered
she
is
going
to
be
content
with
an
emasculated
form
of
friendship
i
talk
to
you
without
reserve
seaman
she
has
made
it
very
plain
that
she
is
going
to
be
content
with
nothing
of
the
what
takes
place
between
you
in
private
seaman
began
rubbish
his
companion
interrupted
the
princess
is
an
impulsive
a
passionate
a
distinctly
primitive
woman
with
a
good
deal
of
the
wild
animal
in
her
still
plots
or
political
necessities
are
not
likely
to
count
a
snap
of
the
fingers
with
but
surely
seaman
protested
she
must
understand
that
your
country
has
claimed
you
for
a
great
work
dominey
shook
his
head
she
is
not
a
german
he
pointed
out
on
the
contrary
like
a
great
many
other
hungarians
i
think
she
rather
dislikes
germany
and
germans
her
only
concern
is
the
personal
question
between
us
she
considers
that
every
moment
of
the
rest
of
my
life
should
be
devoted
to
perhaps
it
is
as
well
seaman
remarked
that
you
have
arranged
to
go
down
to
dominey
i
will
think
out
a
scheme
something
must
be
done
to
pacify
the
lights
were
being
put
out
the
two
men
rose
a
little
unwillingly
dominey
felt
singularly
indisposed
for
sleep
but
anxious
at
the
same
time
to
get
rid
of
his
companion
they
strolled
into
the
darkened
hall
of
the
hotel
together
i
will
deal
with
the
matter
for
you
as
well
as
i
can
seaman
promised
to
my
mind
your
greatest
difficulty
will
be
encountered
you
know
what
you
have
to
deal
with
down
at
dominey
face
was
very
set
and
grave
i
am
prepared
he
said
seaman
still
hesitated
do
you
remember
he
asked
that
when
we
talked
over
your
plans
at
cape
town
you
showed
me
a
picture
of
of
lady
dominey
i
may
i
have
one
more
look
at
it
dominey
with
fingers
that
trembled
a
little
drew
from
the
breast
pocket
of
his
coat
a
leather
case
and
from
that
a
worn
picture
the
two
men
looked
at
it
side
by
side
beneath
one
of
the
electric
standards
which
had
been
left
burning
the
face
was
the
face
of
a
girl
almost
a
child
and
the
great
eyes
seemed
filled
with
a
queer
appealing
light
there
was
something
of
the
same
suggestion
to
be
found
in
the
lips
a
certain
helplessness
an
appeal
for
love
and
protection
to
some
stronger
being
seaman
turned
away
with
a
little
grunt
and
commented
permitting
myself
to
reassume
for
a
moment
or
two
the
ordinary
sentiments
of
an
ordinary
human
being
i
would
sooner
have
a
dozen
of
your
princesses
to
deal
with
than
the
original
of
that
chapter
viii
your
ancestral
home
mangan
observed
as
the
car
turned
the
first
bend
in
the
avenue
and
dominey
hall
came
into
sight
damned
fine
house
too
his
companion
made
no
reply
a
storm
had
come
up
during
the
last
few
minutes
and
as
though
he
felt
the
cold
he
had
dragged
his
hat
over
his
eyes
and
turned
his
coat
collar
up
to
his
ears
the
house
with
its
great
double
front
was
now
clearly
visible
the
elizabethan
red
brick
outline
that
faced
the
park
southwards
and
the
grim
and
back
which
confronted
the
marshes
and
the
sea
mangan
continued
to
make
amiable
conversation
we
have
kept
the
old
place
weathertight
somehow
or
other
he
said
and
i
do
think
you
miss
the
timber
much
we
taken
it
as
far
as
possible
from
the
outlying
any
from
the
black
wood
dominey
asked
without
turning
his
head
not
a
stump
he
replied
and
for
a
very
excellent
reason
not
one
of
the
woodmen
would
ever
go
near
the
the
superstition
remains
then
the
villagers
are
absolutely
rabid
about
it
there
are
at
least
a
dozen
who
declare
that
they
have
seen
the
ghost
of
roger
unthank
and
a
score
or
more
who
will
swear
by
all
that
is
holy
that
they
have
heard
his
call
at
does
he
still
select
the
park
and
the
terrace
outside
the
house
for
his
midnight
perambulations
dominey
enquired
the
lawyer
hesitated
the
idea
is
i
believe
he
said
that
the
ghost
makes
his
way
out
from
the
wood
and
sits
on
the
terrace
underneath
lady
dominey
window
all
bunkum
of
course
but
i
can
assure
you
that
every
servant
and
caretaker
we
had
there
has
given
notice
within
a
month
that
is
the
sole
reason
why
i
have
ventured
to
recommend
long
ago
that
you
should
get
rid
of
she
is
still
in
attendance
upon
lady
dominey
then
simply
because
we
could
get
any
one
else
to
stay
there
the
lawyer
explained
and
her
ladyship
positively
declines
to
leave
the
hall
between
ourselves
i
think
it
time
a
change
was
made
we
have
a
chat
after
dinner
if
you
no
you
see
we
left
all
the
trees
in
the
park
he
went
on
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
beautiful
place
this
in
the
springtime
i
was
down
last
may
for
a
night
and
i
never
saw
such
buttercups
in
my
life
the
cows
here
were
almost
up
to
their
knees
in
pasture
and
the
bluebells
in
the
home
woods
were
wonderful
the
whole
of
the
little
painting
colony
down
at
flankney
turned
themselves
loose
upon
the
place
last
some
of
the
old
wall
is
down
i
see
dominey
remarked
with
a
frown
as
he
gazed
towards
the
enclosed
kitchen
garden
mangan
was
momentarily
surprised
that
wall
has
been
down
to
my
knowledge
for
twenty
years
he
reminded
his
companion
dominey
nodded
i
had
forgotten
he
muttered
we
wrote
you
by
the
by
the
lawyer
continued
suggesting
the
sale
of
one
or
two
of
the
pictures
to
form
a
fund
for
repairs
but
thank
goodness
you
did
reply
we
have
some
workpeople
here
as
soon
as
you
decided
what
you
like
done
i
afraid
he
added
as
they
turned
in
through
some
iron
gates
and
entered
the
last
sweep
in
front
of
the
house
you
wo
find
many
familiar
faces
to
welcome
you
there
loveybond
the
gardener
whom
you
would
scarcely
remember
and
middleton
the
head
keeper
who
has
really
been
a
godsend
so
far
as
the
game
is
concerned
no
one
at
all
indoors
except
the
car
drew
up
at
that
moment
in
front
of
the
great
porch
there
was
nothing
in
the
shape
of
a
reception
they
had
even
to
ring
the
bell
before
the
door
was
opened
by
a
manservant
sent
down
a
few
days
previously
from
town
in
the
background
wearing
a
brown
velveteen
coat
with
breeches
and
leggings
of
corduroy
stood
an
elderly
man
with
white
side
whiskers
and
skin
as
brown
as
a
piece
of
parchment
leaning
heavily
upon
a
long
ash
stick
half
a
dozen
maidservants
new
importations
were
visible
in
the
background
and
a
second
man
was
taking
possession
of
the
luggage
mangan
took
charge
of
the
proceedings
middleton
he
said
resting
his
hand
upon
the
old
man
shoulder
here
your
master
come
back
again
sir
everard
was
very
pleased
to
hear
that
you
were
still
here
and
you
the
old
man
grasped
the
hand
which
dominey
stretched
out
with
both
of
his
i
right
glad
you
back
again
squire
he
said
looking
at
him
with
curious
intentness
and
yet
the
words
of
welcome
stick
in
my
sorry
you
feel
like
that
about
it
middleton
dominey
said
pleasantly
what
is
the
trouble
about
my
coming
back
that
no
trouble
squire
the
old
man
replied
that
a
joy
leastways
to
us
it
what
it
may
turn
out
to
be
for
you
which
makes
one
hold
back
dominey
drew
himself
more
than
ever
erect
a
commanding
figure
in
the
little
group
you
will
feel
better
about
it
when
we
have
had
a
day
or
two
with
the
pheasants
middleton
he
said
reassuringly
you
have
not
changed
much
loveybond
he
added
turning
to
the
man
who
had
fallen
a
little
into
the
background
very
stiff
and
uncomfortable
in
his
sunday
clothes
i
thankee
squire
the
latter
replied
a
little
awkwardly
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
towards
his
forehead
i
ca
say
the
same
for
you
sir
them
furrin
parts
has
filled
you
out
and
hardened
you
i
take
the
liberty
of
saying
that
i
should
never
have
recognised
you
sir
and
that
this
is
parkins
mangan
went
on
pushing
his
way
once
more
into
the
foreground
the
butler
whom
i
engaged
in
london
and
there
was
a
queer
and
instantaneous
silence
the
little
group
of
maidservants
who
had
been
exchanging
whispered
confidences
as
to
their
new
master
appearance
were
suddenly
dumb
all
eyes
were
turned
in
one
direction
a
woman
whose
advent
had
been
unperceived
but
who
had
evidently
issued
from
one
of
the
recesses
of
the
hall
stood
suddenly
before
them
all
she
was
as
thin
as
a
lath
dressed
in
severe
black
with
grey
hair
brushed
back
from
her
head
and
not
even
a
white
collar
at
her
neck
her
face
was
long
and
narrow
her
features
curiously
large
her
eyes
filled
with
anger
she
spoke
very
slowly
but
with
some
trace
in
her
intonation
of
a
dialect
there
no
place
in
this
house
for
you
everard
dominey
she
said
standing
in
front
of
him
as
though
to
bar
his
progress
i
wrote
last
night
to
stop
you
but
you
shown
indecent
haste
in
coming
no
place
here
for
a
murderer
get
back
where
you
came
from
back
to
your
my
good
woman
mangan
gasped
this
is
really
too
much
i
not
come
to
bandy
words
with
lawyers
the
woman
retorted
come
to
speak
to
him
can
you
face
me
everard
dominey
you
who
murdered
my
son
and
made
a
madwoman
of
your
wife
the
lawyer
would
have
answered
her
but
dominey
waved
him
aside
mrs
unthank
he
said
sternly
return
to
your
duties
at
once
and
understand
that
this
house
is
mine
to
enter
or
leave
when
i
she
was
speechless
for
a
moment
amazed
at
the
firmness
of
his
words
the
house
may
be
yours
sir
everard
dominey
she
said
threateningly
but
there
one
part
of
it
at
least
in
which
you
wo
dare
to
show
you
forget
yourself
woman
he
replied
coldly
be
so
good
as
to
return
to
your
mistress
at
once
announce
my
coming
and
say
that
i
wait
only
for
her
permission
before
presenting
myself
in
her
the
woman
laughed
unpleasantly
horribly
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
dominey
curiously
those
are
brave
words
she
said
you
come
back
a
harder
man
let
me
look
at
she
moved
a
foot
or
two
to
where
the
light
was
better
very
slowly
a
frown
developed
upon
her
forehead
the
longer
she
looked
the
less
assured
she
became
there
are
things
in
your
face
i
miss
she
muttered
mangan
was
glad
of
an
opportunity
of
asserting
himself
the
fact
is
scarcely
important
unthank
he
said
angrily
if
you
will
allow
me
to
give
you
a
word
of
advice
you
will
treat
your
master
with
the
respect
to
which
his
position
here
entitles
once
more
the
woman
blazed
up
respect
what
respect
have
i
for
the
murderer
of
my
son
respect
well
if
he
stays
here
against
my
bidding
perhaps
her
ladyship
will
show
him
what
respect
she
turned
around
and
disappeared
every
one
began
bustling
about
the
luggage
and
talking
at
once
mangan
took
his
patron
arm
and
led
him
across
the
hall
my
dear
sir
everard
he
said
anxiously
i
am
most
distressed
that
this
should
have
occurred
i
thought
that
the
woman
would
probably
be
sullen
but
i
had
no
idea
that
she
would
dare
to
attempt
such
an
outrageous
she
is
still
i
presume
the
only
companion
whom
lady
dominey
will
tolerate
dominey
enquired
with
a
sigh
i
fear
so
the
lawyer
admitted
nevertheless
we
must
see
doctor
harrison
in
the
morning
it
must
be
understood
distinctly
that
if
she
is
suffered
to
remain
she
adopts
an
entirely
different
attitude
i
never
heard
anything
so
preposterous
in
all
my
life
i
shall
pay
her
a
visit
myself
after
you
will
feel
quite
at
home
here
in
the
library
sir
everard
mangan
went
on
throwing
open
the
door
of
a
very
fine
apartment
on
the
seaward
side
of
the
house
grand
view
from
these
windows
especially
since
we
had
a
few
of
the
trees
cut
down
i
see
that
parkins
has
set
out
the
sherry
cocktails
i
afraid
are
an
institution
you
will
have
to
inaugurate
down
here
you
be
grateful
to
me
when
i
tell
you
one
thing
sir
everard
we
been
hard
pressed
more
than
once
but
we
have
sold
a
single
bottle
of
wine
out
of
the
dominey
accepted
the
glass
of
sherry
which
the
lawyer
had
poured
out
but
made
no
movement
towards
drinking
it
he
seemed
during
the
last
few
minutes
to
have
been
wrapped
in
a
brown
study
mangan
he
asked
a
little
abruptly
is
it
the
popular
belief
down
here
that
i
killed
roger
unthank
the
lawyer
set
down
the
decanter
and
coughed
a
plain
answer
dominey
insisted
mangan
adapted
himself
to
the
situation
he
was
beginning
to
understand
his
client
i
am
perfectly
certain
sir
everard
he
confessed
that
there
a
soul
in
these
parts
who
is
convinced
of
it
they
believe
that
there
was
a
fight
and
that
you
had
the
best
of
forgive
me
dominey
continued
if
i
seem
to
ask
unnecessary
questions
remember
that
i
spent
the
first
portion
of
my
exile
in
africa
in
a
very
determined
effort
to
blot
out
the
memory
of
everything
that
had
happened
to
me
earlier
in
life
so
that
is
the
popular
belief
the
popular
belief
seems
to
match
fairly
well
with
the
facts
mangan
declared
wielding
the
decanter
again
in
view
of
his
more
reasonable
manner
at
the
time
of
your
unfortunate
visit
to
the
hall
miss
felbrigg
was
living
practically
alone
at
the
vicarage
after
her
uncle
sudden
death
there
with
unthank
as
housekeeper
roger
unthank
infatuation
for
her
was
patent
to
the
whole
neighbourhood
and
a
source
of
great
annoyance
in
miss
felbrigg
i
am
convinced
that
at
no
time
did
lady
dominey
give
the
young
man
the
slightest
has
any
one
ever
believed
the
contrary
dominey
demanded
not
a
soul
was
the
emphatic
reply
nevertheless
when
you
came
down
fell
in
love
with
miss
felbrigg
and
carried
her
off
every
one
felt
that
there
would
be
roger
unthank
was
a
lunatic
dominey
pronounced
deliberately
his
behaviour
from
the
first
was
the
behaviour
of
a
the
eugene
aram
type
of
village
schoolmaster
gradually
drifting
into
positive
insanity
mangan
acquiesced
so
far
every
one
is
agreed
the
mystery
began
when
he
came
back
from
his
holidays
and
heard
the
the
sequel
was
perfectly
simple
dominey
observed
we
met
at
the
north
end
of
the
black
wood
one
evening
and
he
attacked
me
like
a
madman
i
suppose
i
had
to
some
extent
the
best
of
it
but
when
i
got
back
to
the
hall
my
arm
was
broken
i
was
covered
with
blood
and
half
unconscious
by
some
cruel
stroke
of
fortune
almost
the
first
person
i
saw
was
lady
dominey
the
shock
was
too
much
for
her
she
fainted
and
and
has
never
been
quite
herself
since
the
lawyer
concluded
most
tragic
the
cruel
part
of
it
was
dominey
went
on
standing
before
the
window
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
that
my
wife
from
that
moment
developed
a
homicidal
mania
against
me
i
who
had
fought
in
the
most
absolute
that
was
what
drove
me
out
of
the
country
mangan
not
the
fear
of
being
arrested
for
having
caused
the
death
of
roger
unthank
i
have
stood
my
trial
for
that
at
any
moment
it
was
the
other
thing
that
broke
me
quite
so
mangan
murmured
sympathetically
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
were
perfectly
safe
from
arrest
as
it
happened
the
body
of
roger
unthank
has
never
been
found
from
that
day
to
if
it
had
you
must
have
been
charged
with
either
murder
or
dominey
abandoned
his
post
at
the
window
and
raised
his
glass
of
sherry
to
his
lips
the
tragical
side
of
these
reminiscences
seemed
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
to
have
passed
i
suppose
he
remarked
it
was
the
disappearance
of
the
body
which
has
given
rise
to
all
this
talk
as
to
his
spirit
still
inhabiting
the
black
without
a
doubt
the
lawyer
acquiesced
the
place
had
a
bad
name
already
as
you
know
as
it
is
i
do
suppose
there
a
villager
here
would
cross
the
park
in
that
direction
after
dominey
glanced
at
his
watch
and
led
the
way
from
the
room
after
dinner
he
promised
i
tell
you
a
few
west
african
superstitions
which
will
make
our
local
one
seem
chapter
ix
i
certainly
offer
you
my
heartiest
congratulations
upon
your
cellars
sir
everard
his
guest
said
as
he
sipped
his
third
glass
of
port
that
evening
this
is
the
finest
glass
of
seventy
i
drunk
for
a
long
time
and
this
new
fellow
i
sent
you
down
parkins
tells
me
any
quantity
of
it
has
had
a
pretty
long
rest
dominey
observed
i
was
looking
through
the
before
dinner
the
lawyer
went
on
and
i
see
that
you
still
have
and
and
a
small
quantity
of
two
older
vintages
something
ought
to
be
done
about
we
will
try
one
of
them
night
dominey
suggested
we
might
spend
half
an
hour
or
so
in
the
cellars
if
we
have
any
time
to
and
another
half
an
hour
mangan
said
gravely
i
should
like
to
spend
in
interviewing
unthank
apart
from
any
other
question
i
do
not
for
one
moment
believe
that
she
is
the
proper
person
to
be
entrusted
with
the
care
of
lady
dominey
i
made
up
my
mind
to
speak
to
you
on
this
subject
sir
everard
as
soon
as
we
had
arrived
mrs
unthank
was
old
felbrigg
housekeeper
and
my
wife
nurse
when
she
was
a
child
dominey
reminded
his
companion
whatever
her
faults
may
be
i
believe
she
is
devoted
to
lady
she
may
be
devoted
to
your
wife
the
lawyer
admitted
but
i
am
convinced
that
she
is
your
enemy
the
situation
does
seem
to
me
to
be
consistent
unthank
is
firmly
convinced
that
whether
in
fair
fight
or
not
you
killed
her
son
lady
dominey
believes
that
too
and
it
was
the
sight
of
you
after
the
fight
that
sent
her
insane
i
can
not
but
believe
that
it
would
be
far
better
for
lady
dominey
to
have
some
one
with
her
unconnected
with
this
unfortunate
chapter
of
your
we
will
consult
doctor
harrison
dominey
said
i
am
very
glad
you
came
down
with
me
mangan
he
went
on
after
a
hesitation
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
get
back
into
the
atmosphere
of
those
days
i
even
find
it
hard
sometimes
he
added
with
a
curious
little
glance
across
the
table
to
believe
that
i
am
the
same
not
so
hard
as
i
have
done
more
than
once
mangan
confessed
tell
me
exactly
in
what
respects
you
consider
me
changed
dominey
insisted
you
seem
to
have
lost
a
certain
pliability
or
perhaps
i
ought
to
call
it
looseness
of
disposition
he
admitted
there
are
many
things
connected
with
the
past
which
i
find
it
almost
impossible
to
associate
with
you
for
a
trifling
instance
he
went
on
with
a
slight
smile
inclining
his
head
towards
his
host
untasted
glass
you
do
drink
port
like
any
dominey
i
ever
i
afraid
that
i
never
acquired
the
taste
for
port
dominey
observed
the
lawyer
gazed
at
him
with
raised
eyebrows
not
acquired
the
taste
for
port
he
repeated
blankly
i
should
have
said
reacquired
dominey
hastened
to
explain
you
see
in
the
bush
we
drank
a
simply
frightful
amount
of
spirits
and
that
vitiates
the
taste
for
all
the
lawyer
glanced
enviously
at
his
host
fine
bronzed
complexion
and
clear
eyes
you
have
the
appearance
of
ever
having
drunk
anything
sir
everard
he
observed
frankly
one
finds
it
hard
to
believe
the
stories
that
were
going
about
ten
or
fifteen
years
the
dominey
constitution
i
suppose
the
new
butler
entered
the
room
noiselessly
and
came
to
his
chair
i
have
served
coffee
in
the
library
sir
he
announced
mr
middleton
the
gamekeeper
has
just
called
and
asks
if
he
could
have
a
word
with
you
before
he
goes
to
bed
sir
he
seems
in
a
very
nervous
and
uneasy
he
can
come
to
the
library
at
once
dominey
directed
that
is
if
you
are
ready
for
your
coffee
indeed
i
am
the
lawyer
assented
rising
a
great
treat
that
wine
one
thing
the
london
restaurants
ca
give
us
port
should
never
be
drunk
away
from
the
place
where
it
was
laid
the
two
men
made
their
way
across
the
very
fine
hall
the
walls
of
which
had
suffered
a
little
through
lack
of
heating
into
the
library
and
seated
themselves
in
before
the
blazing
log
fire
parkins
silently
served
them
with
coffee
and
brandy
he
had
scarcely
left
the
room
before
there
was
a
timid
knock
and
middleton
made
his
somewhat
hesitating
entrance
come
in
and
close
the
door
dominey
directed
what
is
it
middleton
parkins
says
you
wish
to
speak
to
the
man
came
hesitatingly
forward
he
was
obviously
distressed
and
uneasy
and
found
speech
difficult
his
face
glistened
with
the
rain
which
had
found
its
way
too
in
long
streaks
down
his
velveteen
coat
his
white
hair
was
and
disarranged
bad
night
dominey
remarked
it
to
save
its
being
a
worse
one
that
i
here
squire
the
old
man
replied
hoarsely
i
come
to
ask
you
a
favour
and
to
beg
you
to
grant
it
for
your
own
sake
you
not
sleep
in
the
oak
room
and
why
not
dominey
asked
it
next
her
well
the
old
man
was
obviously
perturbed
but
his
master
as
though
of
a
purpose
refused
to
help
him
he
glanced
at
mangan
and
mumbled
to
himself
say
exactly
what
you
wish
to
middleton
dominey
invited
mr
mangan
and
his
father
and
grandfather
have
been
solicitors
to
the
estate
for
a
great
many
years
they
know
all
our
family
i
ca
get
rightly
into
touch
with
you
squire
and
that
a
fact
middleton
went
on
despairingly
the
shape
of
you
seems
larger
and
your
voice
harder
i
do
seem
to
be
so
near
to
you
as
i
wished
to
say
what
in
my
i
have
had
a
rough
time
middleton
dominey
reminded
him
no
wonder
i
have
changed
never
mind
speak
to
me
just
as
man
to
it
was
i
who
first
met
you
squire
the
old
man
went
on
when
you
tottered
home
that
night
across
the
park
with
your
arm
hanging
helplessly
by
your
side
and
the
blood
streaming
down
your
face
and
clothes
and
the
red
light
in
your
eyes
murderous
fire
they
called
it
i
heard
her
ladyship
go
into
hysterics
i
saw
her
laugh
and
sob
like
a
maniac
and
god
help
us
that
what
she
been
ever
the
two
men
were
silent
middleton
had
raised
his
voice
speaking
with
fierce
excitement
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
only
paused
for
breath
he
had
more
to
say
i
was
by
your
side
squire
he
went
on
when
her
ladyship
caught
up
the
knife
and
ran
at
you
and
as
you
well
know
it
was
i
seizing
her
from
behind
that
saved
a
double
tragedy
that
night
and
it
was
i
who
went
for
the
doctor
the
next
morning
when
she
stolen
into
your
room
in
the
night
and
missed
your
throat
by
a
bare
inch
i
heard
her
call
to
you
heard
her
threat
it
was
a
madwoman
threat
squire
but
her
ladyship
is
a
madwoman
at
this
moment
and
with
a
knife
in
her
hand
you
never
be
safe
in
this
we
must
see
dominey
said
quietly
that
she
is
not
allowed
to
get
possession
of
any
aye
make
sure
of
that
middleton
scoffed
with
mother
unthank
by
her
side
her
ladyship
mad
because
of
the
horror
of
that
night
but
mother
unthank
is
mad
with
hate
and
there
is
a
week
passes
the
old
man
went
on
his
voice
dropping
lower
and
his
eyes
burning
that
roger
unthank
spirit
do
come
and
howl
for
your
blood
beneath
their
window
if
you
stay
here
this
night
squire
come
over
and
sleep
in
the
little
room
they
got
ready
for
you
on
the
other
side
of
the
mangan
had
lost
his
smooth
appearance
his
face
was
rumpled
and
his
coffee
was
growing
cold
this
was
a
very
different
thing
from
the
vague
letters
and
rumours
which
had
reached
him
from
time
to
time
and
which
he
had
put
out
of
his
mind
with
all
the
contempt
of
the
materialist
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
warn
me
middleton
dominey
said
but
i
can
lock
my
door
can
i
not
lock
the
door
of
the
oak
room
was
the
scornful
reply
and
what
good
would
that
do
you
know
well
enough
that
the
wall
double
on
three
sides
and
there
are
more
secret
entrances
than
even
i
know
of
the
oak
room
not
for
you
this
night
squire
it
hoping
to
get
you
there
that
keeping
them
tell
us
what
you
mean
middleton
the
lawyer
asked
with
indifference
when
you
spoke
of
the
howling
of
roger
unthank
spirit
the
old
man
turned
patiently
around
just
that
sir
he
replied
it
round
the
house
most
weeks
except
for
me
odd
nights
and
unthank
there
been
scarcely
a
servant
would
sleep
in
the
hall
for
years
some
of
the
maids
they
do
come
up
from
the
village
but
back
they
go
before
nightfall
and
until
morning
there
is
a
living
soul
would
cross
the
path
no
not
for
a
hundred
a
howl
you
call
it
mangan
observed
that
mostly
like
a
dog
that
hurt
itself
middleton
explained
equably
like
a
dog
that
is
with
a
touch
of
human
in
its
throat
as
we
all
heard
in
our
time
sir
you
hear
it
yourself
sir
maybe
or
you
heard
it
then
middleton
his
master
asked
why
surely
sir
the
old
man
replied
in
surprise
most
weeks
for
the
last
ten
have
you
ever
got
up
and
gone
out
to
see
what
it
was
the
old
man
shook
his
head
but
i
knew
right
well
what
that
was
sir
he
said
and
i
not
one
for
looking
on
spirits
spirits
there
are
that
walk
this
world
as
we
well
know
and
the
spirit
of
roger
unthank
walks
from
between
the
black
wood
and
those
windows
come
every
week
of
the
year
but
i
not
for
looking
at
him
there
evil
comes
of
that
i
turn
over
in
my
bed
and
i
stop
my
ears
but
i
never
yet
raised
a
tell
me
middleton
dominey
asked
is
lady
dominey
terrified
at
these
er
visitations
that
i
ca
rightly
say
sir
her
ladyship
always
sweet
and
gentle
with
kind
words
on
her
lips
for
every
one
but
there
the
terror
there
in
her
eyes
that
was
lit
that
night
when
you
staggered
into
the
hall
squire
and
i
never
seen
it
properly
quenched
yet
so
to
speak
she
carries
fear
with
her
but
whether
it
the
fear
of
seeing
you
again
or
the
fear
of
roger
unthank
spirit
i
could
not
dominey
seemed
suddenly
to
become
possessed
of
a
strange
desire
to
thrust
the
whole
subject
away
he
dismissed
the
old
man
kindly
but
a
little
abruptly
accompanying
him
to
the
corridor
which
led
to
the
servants
quarters
and
talking
all
the
time
about
the
pheasants
when
he
returned
he
found
that
his
guest
had
emptied
his
second
glass
of
brandy
and
was
surreptitiously
mopping
his
forehead
that
the
latter
remarked
is
the
class
of
old
retainer
who
lives
too
long
if
i
were
a
dominey
of
the
middle
ages
i
think
a
stone
around
his
neck
and
the
deepest
well
would
be
the
sensible
way
of
dealing
with
him
he
made
me
feel
positively
i
noticed
it
dominey
remarked
with
a
faint
smile
i
not
going
to
pretend
that
it
was
a
pleasant
conversation
i
heard
some
ghost
stories
mangan
went
on
but
a
spook
that
comes
and
howls
once
a
week
for
ten
years
takes
some
dominey
poured
himself
out
a
glass
of
brandy
with
a
steady
hand
you
been
neglecting
things
here
mangan
he
complained
you
ought
to
have
come
down
and
exorcised
that
ghost
we
shall
have
those
smart
maidservants
of
yours
off
i
suppose
unless
you
and
i
can
get
a
little
in
mangan
began
to
feel
more
comfortable
the
brandy
and
the
warmth
of
the
burning
logs
were
creeping
into
his
system
by
the
by
sir
everard
he
enquired
a
little
later
on
where
are
you
going
to
sleep
dominey
stretched
himself
out
composedly
there
is
obviously
only
one
place
for
me
he
replied
i
disappoint
any
one
i
shall
sleep
in
the
oak
chapter
x
for
the
first
few
tangled
moments
of
nightmare
slowly
developing
into
a
live
horror
dominey
fancied
himself
back
in
africa
with
the
hand
of
an
enemy
upon
his
throat
then
a
rush
of
awakened
memories
the
silence
of
the
great
house
the
mysterious
rustling
of
the
heavy
hangings
around
the
black
oak
on
which
he
lay
the
faint
pricking
of
something
deadly
at
his
throat
these
things
rolled
back
the
curtain
of
unreality
brought
him
acute
and
painful
consciousness
of
a
situation
almost
appalling
he
opened
his
eyes
and
although
a
brave
and
callous
man
he
lay
still
paralysed
with
the
fear
which
forbids
motion
the
dim
light
of
a
candle
recently
lit
flashed
upon
the
dagger
held
at
his
throat
he
gazed
at
the
thin
line
of
gleaming
steel
fascinated
already
his
skin
had
been
broken
a
few
drops
of
blood
were
upon
the
collar
of
his
pyjamas
the
hand
which
held
that
deadly
assailing
weapon
small
slim
very
feminine
curving
from
somewhere
behind
the
bed
curtain
belonged
to
some
unseen
person
he
tried
to
shrink
farther
back
upon
the
pillow
the
hand
followed
him
displaying
glimpses
now
of
a
soft
arm
he
lay
quite
still
the
muscles
of
his
right
arm
growing
tenser
as
he
prepared
for
a
snatch
at
those
cruel
fingers
then
a
voice
came
a
slow
feminine
and
rather
wonderful
voice
if
you
move
it
said
you
will
die
remain
quite
dominey
was
fully
conscious
now
his
brain
at
work
calculating
his
chances
with
all
the
cunning
of
the
trained
hunter
who
seeks
to
avoid
death
reluctantly
he
was
compelled
to
realise
that
no
movement
of
his
could
be
quick
enough
to
prevent
the
driving
of
that
thin
stiletto
into
his
throat
if
his
hidden
assailant
should
keep
her
word
so
he
lay
still
why
do
you
want
to
kill
me
he
asked
a
little
tensely
there
was
no
reply
yet
somehow
he
knew
that
he
was
being
watched
ever
so
slightly
those
curtains
around
which
the
arm
had
come
were
being
parted
through
the
chink
some
one
was
looking
at
him
the
thought
came
that
he
might
call
out
for
help
and
once
more
his
unseen
enemy
read
his
thought
you
must
be
very
quiet
the
voice
said
that
voice
which
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
believe
was
not
the
voice
of
a
child
if
you
even
speak
above
a
whisper
it
will
be
the
end
i
wish
to
look
at
a
little
wider
the
crack
opened
and
then
he
began
to
feel
hope
the
hand
which
held
the
stiletto
was
shaking
he
heard
something
which
sounded
like
quick
breathing
from
behind
the
curtains
the
breathing
of
a
woman
astonished
or
terrified
and
then
so
suddenly
that
for
several
seconds
he
could
not
move
or
take
advantage
of
the
circumstance
the
hand
with
its
cruel
weapon
was
withdrawn
around
the
curtain
and
a
woman
began
to
laugh
softly
at
first
and
then
with
a
little
hysterical
sob
thrusting
its
way
through
that
incongruous
note
of
mirth
he
lay
upon
the
bed
as
though
mesmerised
finding
at
his
first
effort
that
his
limbs
refused
their
office
as
might
the
limbs
of
one
lying
under
the
thrall
of
a
nightmare
the
laugh
died
away
there
was
a
sound
like
a
scraping
upon
the
wall
the
candle
was
suddenly
blown
out
then
his
nerve
began
to
return
and
with
it
his
control
over
his
limbs
he
crawled
to
the
side
of
the
bed
remote
from
the
curtains
stole
to
the
little
table
on
which
he
had
left
his
revolver
and
an
electric
torch
snatched
at
them
and
with
the
former
in
his
right
hand
flashed
a
little
orb
of
light
into
the
shadows
of
the
great
apartment
once
more
something
like
terror
seized
him
the
figure
which
had
been
standing
by
the
side
of
his
bed
had
vanished
there
was
no
hiding
place
in
view
every
inch
of
the
room
was
lit
up
by
the
powerful
torch
he
carried
and
save
for
himself
the
room
was
empty
the
first
moment
of
realisation
was
chill
and
unnerving
then
the
slight
smarting
of
the
wound
at
his
throat
became
convincing
proof
to
him
that
there
was
nothing
supernatural
about
this
visit
he
lit
up
of
the
candles
distributed
about
the
place
and
laid
down
his
torch
he
was
ashamed
to
find
that
his
forehead
was
dripping
with
perspiration
one
of
the
secret
passages
of
course
he
muttered
to
himself
stooping
for
a
moment
to
examine
the
locked
folding
doors
which
separated
his
room
from
the
adjoining
one
perhaps
when
one
reflects
i
have
run
unnecessary
dominey
was
standing
at
the
window
looking
out
at
the
tumbled
grey
waters
of
the
north
sea
when
parkins
brought
him
hot
water
and
tea
in
the
morning
he
thrust
his
feet
into
slippers
and
held
out
his
arms
for
a
find
out
where
the
nearest
bathroom
is
parkins
he
ordered
and
prepare
it
i
have
quite
forgotten
my
way
about
very
good
the
man
was
motionless
for
a
moment
staring
at
the
blood
on
his
master
pyjamas
dominey
glanced
down
at
it
and
turned
the
up
to
his
throat
i
had
a
slight
accident
this
morning
he
remarked
carelessly
any
ghost
alarms
last
light
none
that
i
heard
of
sir
the
man
replied
i
am
afraid
we
should
have
difficulty
in
keeping
the
young
women
from
london
if
they
heard
what
i
heard
the
night
of
my
very
terrible
was
it
dominey
asked
with
a
smile
parkins
expression
remained
immovable
there
was
in
his
tone
however
a
mute
protest
against
his
master
levity
the
cries
were
the
most
terrible
i
have
ever
heard
sir
he
said
i
am
not
a
nervous
person
but
i
found
them
most
human
or
animal
a
mixture
of
both
i
should
say
you
should
camp
out
for
the
night
on
the
skirts
of
an
african
forest
dominey
remarked
there
you
get
a
whole
orchestra
of
wild
animals
every
one
of
them
trying
to
freeze
your
blood
i
was
out
in
south
africa
during
the
boer
war
sir
parkins
replied
and
i
went
big
game
hunting
with
my
master
afterwards
i
do
not
think
that
any
animal
was
ever
born
in
africa
with
so
terrifying
a
cry
as
we
heard
the
night
before
we
must
look
into
the
matter
dominey
muttered
i
have
already
prepared
a
bath
sir
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
the
man
announced
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
show
you
the
dominey
when
he
descended
about
an
hour
later
found
his
guest
awaiting
him
in
the
smaller
which
looked
out
eastwards
towards
the
sea
a
lofty
apartment
with
great
windows
and
with
an
air
of
faded
splendour
which
came
from
the
tapestries
hanging
in
places
from
the
wall
mangan
had
contrary
to
his
expectations
slept
well
and
was
in
excellent
spirits
the
row
of
silver
dishes
upon
the
sideboard
inspired
him
with
an
added
cheerfulness
so
there
were
no
ghosts
walking
last
night
he
remarked
as
he
took
his
place
at
the
table
wonderful
thing
this
absolute
quiet
is
after
london
give
you
my
word
i
never
heard
a
sound
from
the
moment
my
head
touched
the
pillow
until
i
woke
a
short
while
dominey
returned
from
the
sideboard
carrying
also
a
plate
i
had
a
pretty
useful
night
rest
myself
he
observed
mangan
raised
his
eyeglass
and
gazed
at
his
host
throat
cut
yourself
he
queried
razor
slipped
dominey
told
him
you
get
out
of
the
use
of
those
things
in
you
managed
to
give
yourself
a
nasty
gash
mangan
observed
curiously
parkins
is
going
to
send
up
for
a
new
set
of
safety
razors
for
me
dominey
announced
about
our
plans
for
the
day
i
ordered
the
car
for
this
afternoon
if
that
suits
you
we
can
look
around
the
place
quietly
this
morning
johnson
is
sleeping
over
at
a
farmhouse
near
here
we
shall
pick
him
up
en
route
and
i
have
told
lees
the
bailiff
to
come
with
us
mangan
nodded
his
approval
upon
my
word
he
confessed
it
will
be
a
joy
to
me
to
go
and
see
some
of
these
fellows
without
having
to
put
off
about
repairs
and
that
sort
of
thing
johnson
has
had
the
worst
of
it
poor
chap
but
there
are
one
or
two
of
them
took
it
into
their
heads
to
come
up
to
london
and
worry
me
at
the
i
intend
that
there
shall
be
no
more
dissatisfaction
amongst
my
mangan
set
off
for
another
prowl
towards
the
sideboard
satisfied
tenants
you
never
will
get
in
norfolk
he
declared
i
must
admit
though
that
some
of
them
have
had
cause
to
grumble
lately
there
a
fellow
round
by
wells
who
farms
nearly
eight
hundred
acres
he
broke
off
in
his
speech
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
not
an
ordinary
knock
at
all
but
a
measured
deliberate
tapping
three
times
repeated
come
in
dominey
called
out
unthank
entered
severer
more
unattractive
than
ever
in
the
hard
morning
light
she
came
to
the
end
of
the
table
facing
the
place
where
dominey
was
seated
good
morning
unthank
he
said
she
ignored
the
greeting
i
am
the
bearer
of
a
message
she
announced
pray
deliver
it
dominey
replied
her
ladyship
would
be
glad
for
you
to
visit
her
in
her
apartment
at
dominey
leaned
back
in
his
chair
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
face
of
the
woman
whose
antagonism
to
himself
was
so
apparent
she
stood
in
the
path
of
a
long
gleam
of
morning
sunlight
the
wrinkles
in
her
face
her
hard
mouth
her
cold
steely
eyes
were
all
clearly
revealed
i
am
not
at
all
sure
he
said
with
a
purpose
in
the
words
that
any
further
meeting
between
lady
dominey
and
myself
is
at
present
if
he
had
thought
to
disturb
this
messenger
by
his
suggestion
he
was
disappointed
her
ladyship
desires
me
to
assure
you
she
added
with
a
note
of
contempt
in
her
tone
that
you
need
be
under
no
dominey
admitted
defeat
and
poured
himself
out
some
more
coffee
neither
of
the
two
noticed
that
his
fingers
were
trembling
her
ladyship
is
very
considerate
he
said
kindly
say
that
i
shall
follow
you
in
a
few
dominey
following
within
a
very
few
minutes
of
his
summons
was
ushered
into
an
apartment
large
and
sombrely
elegant
an
apartment
of
faded
white
and
gold
walls
of
chandeliers
glittering
with
lustres
of
louise
quinze
furniture
shabby
but
priceless
to
his
surprise
although
he
scarcely
noticed
it
at
the
time
unthank
promptly
disappeared
he
was
from
the
first
left
alone
with
the
woman
whom
he
had
come
to
visit
she
was
sitting
up
on
her
couch
and
watching
his
approach
a
woman
surely
only
a
child
with
pale
cheeks
large
anxious
eyes
and
masses
of
brown
hair
brushed
back
from
her
forehead
after
all
was
he
indeed
a
strong
man
vowed
to
great
things
there
was
a
queer
feeling
in
his
throat
almost
a
mist
before
his
eyes
she
seemed
so
fragile
so
utterly
sweetly
pathetic
and
all
the
time
there
was
the
strange
light
or
was
it
want
of
light
in
those
haunting
eyes
his
speech
of
greeting
was
never
spoken
so
you
have
come
to
see
me
everard
she
said
in
a
broken
tone
you
are
very
he
possessed
himself
of
her
hand
the
hand
which
a
few
hours
ago
had
held
a
dagger
to
his
throat
and
kissed
the
waxenlike
fingers
it
fell
to
her
side
like
a
lifeless
thing
then
she
raised
it
and
began
rubbing
softly
at
the
place
where
his
lips
had
fallen
i
have
come
to
see
you
at
your
bidding
he
replied
and
for
my
pleasure
she
murmured
with
a
ghastly
little
smile
you
have
learnt
to
control
your
words
everard
you
have
slept
here
and
you
live
i
have
broken
my
word
i
wonder
why
because
he
pleaded
i
have
not
deserved
that
you
should
seek
my
that
sounds
strangely
she
reflected
does
it
say
somewhere
in
the
bible
life
for
a
life
you
killed
roger
i
have
killed
other
men
since
in
dominey
told
her
sometimes
it
comes
to
a
man
that
he
must
slay
or
be
slain
it
was
roger
unthank
i
shall
not
talk
about
him
any
longer
she
decided
quite
calmly
the
night
before
last
his
spirit
was
calling
to
me
below
my
window
he
wants
me
to
go
down
into
hell
and
live
with
him
the
very
thought
is
come
dominey
said
we
shall
speak
of
other
things
you
must
tell
me
what
presents
i
can
buy
you
i
have
come
back
from
africa
presents
for
a
single
wonderful
moment
hers
was
the
face
of
a
child
who
had
been
offered
toys
her
smile
of
anticipation
was
delightful
her
eyes
had
lost
that
strange
vacancy
then
before
he
could
say
another
word
it
all
came
back
again
listen
to
me
she
said
this
is
important
i
have
sent
for
you
because
i
do
not
understand
why
quite
suddenly
last
night
after
i
had
made
up
my
mind
i
lost
the
desire
to
kill
you
it
is
gone
now
i
am
not
sure
about
myself
any
longer
draw
your
chair
nearer
to
mine
or
no
come
to
my
side
here
at
the
other
end
of
the
she
moved
her
skirts
to
make
room
for
him
when
he
sat
down
he
felt
a
strange
trembling
through
all
his
limbs
perhaps
she
went
on
i
shall
break
my
oath
indeed
i
have
already
broken
it
let
me
look
at
you
my
husband
it
is
a
strange
thing
to
own
after
all
these
years
a
dominey
felt
as
though
he
were
breathing
an
atmosphere
of
turgid
and
poisoned
sweetness
there
was
a
flavour
of
unreality
about
the
whole
situation
the
room
this
child
woman
her
beauty
her
deliberate
halting
speech
and
the
strange
things
she
said
you
find
me
changed
he
asked
you
are
very
wonderfully
changed
you
look
stronger
you
are
perhaps
yet
there
is
something
gone
from
your
face
which
i
thought
one
never
you
he
said
cautiously
are
more
beautiful
than
ever
she
laughed
a
little
drearily
of
what
use
has
my
beauty
been
to
me
everard
since
you
came
to
my
little
cottage
and
loved
me
and
made
me
love
you
and
took
me
away
from
dour
roger
do
you
remember
the
school
chidden
used
to
call
him
dour
roger
but
that
does
not
matter
do
you
know
everard
that
since
you
left
me
my
feet
have
not
passed
outside
these
gardens
that
can
be
altered
when
you
wish
he
said
quickly
you
can
visit
where
you
will
you
can
have
a
even
a
house
in
town
i
shall
bring
some
wonderful
doctors
here
and
they
will
make
you
quite
strong
her
large
eyes
were
lifted
almost
piteously
to
his
but
how
can
i
leave
here
she
asked
plaintively
every
week
sometimes
oftener
he
calls
to
me
if
i
went
away
his
spirit
would
break
loose
and
follow
me
i
must
be
here
to
wave
my
hand
then
he
goes
dominey
was
conscious
once
more
of
that
strange
and
most
unexpected
fit
of
emotion
he
was
unrecognisable
even
to
himself
never
before
in
his
life
had
his
heart
beaten
as
it
was
beating
now
his
eyes
too
were
hot
he
had
travelled
around
the
word
in
search
of
new
things
only
to
find
them
in
this
strange
faded
chamber
side
by
side
with
this
suffering
woman
nevertheless
he
said
quietly
we
must
send
you
some
place
where
the
people
are
kinder
and
where
life
is
pleasanter
perhaps
you
love
music
and
to
see
beautiful
pictures
i
think
that
we
must
try
and
keep
you
from
she
sighed
in
a
perplexed
fashion
i
wish
that
i
could
get
it
out
of
my
blood
that
i
want
to
kill
you
then
you
could
take
me
right
away
other
married
people
have
lived
together
and
hated
each
other
why
should
we
we
may
forget
even
to
dominey
staggered
to
his
feet
walked
to
a
window
threw
it
open
and
leaned
out
for
a
moment
then
he
closed
it
and
came
back
this
new
element
in
the
situation
had
been
a
shock
to
him
all
the
time
she
was
watching
him
composedly
well
she
asked
with
a
strange
little
smile
what
do
you
say
would
you
like
to
hold
as
a
wife
the
hand
which
frightened
you
so
last
night
she
held
it
out
to
him
soft
and
warm
her
fingers
even
returned
the
pressure
of
his
she
looked
at
him
pleasantly
and
once
more
he
felt
like
a
man
who
has
wandered
into
a
strange
country
and
has
lost
his
bearings
i
want
you
so
much
to
be
happy
he
said
hoarsely
but
you
are
not
strong
yet
rosamund
we
can
not
decide
anything
in
a
how
surprised
you
are
to
find
that
i
am
willing
to
be
nice
to
you
she
murmured
but
why
not
you
can
not
know
why
i
have
so
suddenly
changed
my
mind
about
you
and
i
have
changed
it
i
have
seen
the
truth
these
few
minutes
there
is
a
reason
everard
why
i
should
not
kill
what
is
it
he
demanded
she
shook
her
head
with
all
the
joy
of
a
child
who
keeps
a
secret
you
are
clever
she
said
i
will
leave
you
to
find
it
out
i
am
excited
now
and
i
want
you
to
go
away
for
a
little
time
please
send
unthank
to
the
prospect
of
release
was
a
strange
relief
mingled
still
more
strangely
with
regret
he
lingered
over
her
hand
if
you
walk
in
your
sleep
then
he
begged
you
will
leave
your
dagger
behind
i
have
told
you
she
answered
as
though
surprised
that
i
have
abandoned
my
intention
i
shall
not
kill
you
even
though
i
may
walk
in
my
sleep
and
sometimes
the
nights
are
so
long
it
will
not
be
your
death
i
chapter
xi
dominey
left
the
room
like
a
man
in
a
dream
descended
the
stairs
to
his
own
part
of
the
house
caught
up
a
hat
and
stick
and
strode
out
into
the
sea
mist
which
was
fast
enveloping
the
gardens
there
was
all
the
chill
of
the
north
pole
in
that
cloud
of
vapour
but
nevertheless
his
forehead
remained
hot
his
pulses
burning
he
passed
out
of
the
postern
gate
which
led
from
the
walled
garden
on
to
a
broad
marsh
with
dikes
running
here
and
there
and
lapping
tongues
of
sea
water
creeping
in
with
the
tide
he
made
his
way
seaward
with
uncertain
steps
until
he
reached
a
rough
and
stony
road
here
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
looked
about
him
and
then
turned
back
at
right
angles
soon
he
came
to
a
little
village
a
village
of
ancient
cottages
with
seasoned
tiles
trim
little
patches
of
garden
a
church
embowered
with
tall
elm
trees
a
triangular
green
at
the
on
one
side
a
low
thatched
building
the
dominey
arms
on
another
an
ancient
square
stone
house
on
which
was
a
brass
plate
he
went
over
and
read
the
name
rang
the
bell
and
asked
the
trim
maidservant
who
answered
it
for
the
doctor
presently
a
man
of
youthful
presented
himself
in
the
surgery
and
bowed
dominey
was
for
a
moment
at
a
loss
i
came
to
see
doctor
harrison
he
ventured
doctor
harrison
retired
from
practice
some
years
ago
was
the
courteous
reply
i
am
his
nephew
my
name
is
i
understood
that
doctor
harrison
was
still
in
the
neighbourhood
dominey
said
my
name
is
dominey
sir
everard
i
guessed
as
much
the
other
replied
my
uncle
lives
with
me
here
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
he
was
hoping
that
you
would
come
and
see
him
he
retains
one
patient
only
doctor
stillwell
added
in
a
graver
tone
you
can
imagine
who
that
would
his
caller
bowed
lady
dominey
i
the
young
doctor
opened
the
door
and
motioned
to
his
guest
to
precede
him
my
uncle
has
his
own
little
apartment
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
he
said
you
must
let
me
take
you
to
they
moved
across
the
pleasant
white
stone
hall
into
a
small
apartment
with
french
windows
leading
out
to
a
flagged
terrace
and
tennis
lawn
an
elderly
man
with
face
grey
hair
and
of
somewhat
serious
aspect
looked
around
from
the
window
before
which
he
was
standing
examining
a
case
of
fishing
flies
uncle
i
have
brought
an
old
friend
in
to
see
you
his
nephew
announced
the
doctor
glanced
expectantly
at
dominey
half
moved
forward
as
though
to
greet
him
then
checked
himself
and
shook
his
head
doubtfully
you
certainly
remind
me
very
much
of
an
old
friend
sir
he
said
but
i
can
see
now
that
you
are
not
he
i
do
not
believe
that
i
have
ever
seen
you
before
in
my
there
was
a
moment
somewhat
tense
silence
then
dominey
advanced
a
little
stiffly
and
held
out
his
hand
come
doctor
he
said
i
can
scarcely
have
changed
as
much
as
all
that
even
these
years
of
strenuous
life
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
i
am
speaking
to
everard
dominey
the
doctor
interposed
without
a
doubt
the
doctor
shook
hands
coolly
his
was
certainly
not
the
enthusiastic
welcome
of
an
old
family
attendant
to
the
representative
of
a
great
family
i
should
certainly
never
have
recognised
you
he
confessed
my
presence
here
is
nevertheless
indisputable
dominey
continued
still
attracted
by
your
old
pastime
i
see
doctor
i
have
only
taken
up
fly
fishing
the
other
replied
drily
since
i
gave
up
there
was
another
somewhat
awkward
pause
which
the
younger
man
endeavoured
to
bridge
over
fishing
shooting
golf
he
said
i
really
do
know
what
we
poor
medical
practitioners
would
do
in
the
country
without
i
shall
remind
you
of
that
later
dominey
observed
i
am
told
that
the
shooting
is
one
of
the
only
glories
that
has
not
passed
away
from
i
shall
look
forward
to
the
reminder
was
the
prompt
response
his
uncle
who
had
been
bending
once
more
over
the
case
of
flies
turned
abruptly
around
arthur
he
said
addressing
his
nephew
you
had
better
start
on
your
round
i
dare
say
sir
everard
would
like
to
speak
to
me
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
certainly
dominey
admitted
but
only
professionally
there
is
no
necessity
i
am
late
already
if
you
will
excuse
me
doctor
stillwell
interrupted
i
will
be
getting
on
you
must
excuse
my
uncle
sir
everard
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
drawing
him
a
little
towards
the
door
if
his
manners
are
a
little
gruff
he
is
devoted
to
lady
dominey
and
i
sometimes
think
that
he
broods
over
her
case
too
dominey
nodded
and
turned
back
into
the
room
to
find
the
doctor
his
hands
in
his
breeches
pockets
eyeing
him
steadfastly
i
find
it
very
hard
to
believe
he
said
a
little
curtly
that
you
are
really
everard
i
am
afraid
you
will
have
to
accept
me
as
a
fact
your
present
appearance
the
old
man
continued
eyeing
him
appraisingly
does
not
in
any
way
bear
out
the
description
i
had
of
you
some
years
ago
i
was
told
that
you
had
become
a
the
world
is
full
of
liars
dominey
said
equably
you
appear
to
have
met
with
one
at
you
have
not
even
the
doctor
persisted
the
appearance
of
a
man
who
has
been
used
to
excesses
of
any
good
old
stock
ours
his
visitor
observed
carelessly
plenty
of
men
behind
my
you
have
also
gained
courage
since
the
days
when
you
fled
from
england
you
slept
at
the
hall
last
night
where
else
i
also
if
you
want
to
know
occupied
my
own
bedchamber
with
results
dominey
added
throwing
his
head
a
little
back
to
display
the
scar
on
his
throat
altogether
that
just
your
luck
the
doctor
declared
you
no
right
to
have
gone
there
without
seeing
me
no
right
after
all
that
has
passed
to
have
even
approached
your
you
seem
rather
a
martinet
as
regards
my
domestic
affairs
dominey
observed
that
because
i
know
your
history
was
the
blunt
reply
uninvited
dominey
seated
himself
in
an
you
were
never
my
friend
doctor
he
said
let
me
suggest
that
we
conduct
this
conversation
on
a
purely
professional
i
was
never
your
friend
came
the
retort
because
i
have
known
you
always
as
a
selfish
brute
because
you
were
married
to
the
sweetest
woman
on
god
earth
gave
up
none
of
your
bad
habits
frightened
her
into
insanity
by
reeling
home
with
another
man
blood
on
your
hands
and
then
stayed
away
for
over
ten
years
instead
of
making
an
effort
to
repair
the
mischief
you
had
this
observed
dominey
is
history
dished
up
in
a
somewhat
partial
fashion
i
repeat
my
suggestion
that
we
confine
our
conversation
to
the
this
is
my
house
the
other
rejoined
and
you
came
to
see
me
i
shall
say
exactly
what
i
like
to
you
and
if
you
do
like
it
you
can
get
out
if
it
were
for
lady
dominey
sake
you
should
have
passed
this
then
for
her
sake
dominey
suggested
in
a
softer
tone
ca
you
forget
how
thoroughly
you
disapprove
of
me
i
am
here
now
with
only
one
object
i
want
you
to
point
out
to
me
any
way
in
which
we
can
work
together
for
the
improvement
of
my
wife
there
can
be
no
question
of
a
partnership
between
you
refuse
to
help
my
help
is
worth
a
snap
of
the
fingers
i
have
done
all
i
can
for
her
physically
she
is
a
perfectly
sound
woman
the
rest
depends
upon
you
and
you
alone
and
i
am
not
very
hopeful
about
upon
me
dominey
repeated
a
little
taken
aback
fidelity
the
doctor
grunted
is
second
nature
with
all
good
women
lady
dominey
is
a
good
woman
and
she
is
no
exception
to
the
rule
her
brain
is
starved
because
her
heart
is
aching
for
love
if
she
could
believe
in
your
repentance
and
reform
if
any
atonement
for
the
past
were
possible
and
were
generously
offered
i
can
not
tell
what
the
result
might
be
they
tell
me
that
you
are
a
rich
man
now
although
heaven
knows
when
one
considers
what
a
lazy
selfish
fellow
you
were
that
sounds
like
a
miracle
you
could
have
the
great
specialists
down
they
could
help
but
it
might
salve
your
conscience
to
pay
them
a
few
hundred
would
you
meet
them
dominey
asked
anxiously
tell
me
whom
to
send
for
pooh
those
days
are
finished
with
me
was
the
curt
reply
i
would
meet
none
of
them
i
am
a
doctor
no
longer
i
have
become
a
villager
i
go
to
see
lady
dominey
as
an
old
give
me
your
advice
dominey
begged
is
it
of
any
use
sending
for
specialists
just
for
the
present
none
at
and
what
about
that
horrible
woman
unthank
part
of
your
task
if
you
are
really
going
to
take
it
up
she
stands
between
your
wife
and
the
then
why
have
you
suffered
her
to
remain
there
all
those
years
dominey
demanded
for
one
thing
because
there
has
been
no
one
to
replace
her
the
doctor
replied
and
for
another
because
lady
dominey
believing
that
you
slew
her
son
has
some
fantastic
idea
of
giving
her
a
home
and
shelter
as
a
kind
of
you
think
there
is
no
affection
between
the
two
dominey
asked
not
a
scrap
was
the
blunt
reply
except
that
lady
dominey
is
of
so
sweet
and
gentle
a
nature
the
doctor
paused
abruptly
his
visitor
fingers
had
strayed
across
his
throat
that
a
different
matter
the
former
continued
fiercely
that
just
where
the
weak
spot
in
her
brain
remains
if
you
ask
me
i
believe
pandered
to
by
unthank
come
to
think
of
it
he
went
on
the
domineys
were
never
cowards
if
you
got
your
courage
back
send
unthank
away
sleep
with
your
doors
wide
open
if
a
single
night
passes
without
lady
dominey
coming
to
your
room
with
a
knife
in
her
hand
she
will
be
cured
in
time
of
that
mania
at
any
rate
dare
you
do
that
dominey
hesitation
was
palpable
also
his
agitation
the
doctor
grinned
contemptuously
still
afraid
he
scoffed
not
in
the
way
you
imagine
his
visitor
replied
my
wife
has
already
promised
to
make
no
further
attempt
upon
my
well
you
can
cure
her
if
you
want
to
the
doctor
declared
and
if
you
do
you
will
have
the
sweetest
companion
for
life
any
man
could
have
but
you
have
to
give
up
the
idea
of
town
houses
and
racing
and
yachting
and
grouse
moors
in
scotland
and
all
those
sort
of
things
i
suppose
you
been
looking
forward
to
you
have
for
some
time
at
any
rate
to
give
every
moment
of
your
time
to
your
dominey
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
for
the
next
few
months
he
said
that
would
be
impossible
the
doctor
repeated
the
word
seemed
to
roll
it
round
in
his
mouth
with
a
sort
of
wondering
scorn
i
am
not
quite
the
idler
i
used
to
be
dominey
explained
frowning
nowadays
you
can
not
make
money
without
assuming
responsibilities
i
am
clearing
off
the
whole
of
the
mortgages
upon
the
dominey
estates
within
the
next
few
how
you
spend
your
time
is
your
affair
not
mine
the
doctor
muttered
all
i
say
about
the
matter
is
that
your
wife
cure
if
ever
it
comes
to
pass
is
in
your
hands
and
now
come
over
to
me
here
in
the
light
of
this
window
i
want
to
look
at
dominey
obeyed
with
a
little
shrug
of
the
shoulders
there
was
no
sunshine
but
the
white
north
light
was
in
its
way
searching
it
showed
the
sprinkling
of
grey
in
his
hair
the
suspicion
of
it
in
his
closely
trimmed
moustache
but
it
could
find
no
weak
spot
in
his
steady
eyes
in
the
tan
of
his
hard
manly
complexion
or
even
in
the
set
of
his
somewhat
arrogant
lips
the
old
doctor
took
up
his
box
of
flies
again
and
jerked
his
head
towards
the
door
you
are
a
miracle
he
said
and
i
hate
miracles
i
come
and
see
lady
dominey
in
a
day
or
chapter
xii
dominey
spent
a
curiously
placid
and
to
those
with
whom
he
was
brought
into
contact
an
entirely
satisfactory
afternoon
with
mangan
by
his
side
murmuring
amiable
platitudes
and
johnson
his
agent
opposite
revelling
in
the
unusual
situation
of
a
satisfied
landlord
and
delighted
tenants
he
made
practically
the
entire
round
of
the
dominey
estates
they
reached
home
late
but
dominey
although
he
seemed
to
be
living
in
another
world
was
not
neglectful
of
the
claims
of
hospitality
probably
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
johnson
and
lees
the
bailiff
watched
the
opening
of
a
magnum
of
champagne
johnson
cleared
his
throat
as
he
raised
his
glass
it
is
only
on
my
own
account
sir
everard
he
said
that
i
drink
your
hearty
good
health
i
have
your
tenants
too
in
my
mind
had
a
rough
time
some
of
them
and
they
stood
it
like
white
men
so
here
from
them
and
me
to
you
sir
and
may
we
see
plenty
of
you
in
these
lees
associated
himself
with
these
sentiments
and
the
glasses
were
speedily
emptied
and
filled
again
i
suppose
you
know
sir
everard
the
agent
observed
that
what
promised
to
do
will
cost
a
matter
of
ten
to
fifteen
thousand
dominey
nodded
before
i
go
to
bed
he
said
i
shall
send
a
cheque
for
twenty
thousand
pounds
to
the
estate
account
at
your
bank
at
wells
the
money
is
there
waiting
put
aside
for
just
that
one
purpose
and
well
you
may
just
as
well
have
agent
and
bailiff
leaned
back
in
the
tonneau
of
their
half
an
hour
later
with
immense
cigars
in
their
mouths
and
a
pleasant
rippling
warmth
in
their
veins
they
had
the
sense
of
having
drifted
into
fairyland
their
philosophy
however
met
the
situation
it
a
fair
miracle
lees
declared
a
modern
romance
johnson
who
read
novels
murmured
hello
here
a
visitor
for
the
hall
he
added
as
a
car
swept
by
them
gent
too
lees
remarked
the
gent
was
otto
seaman
who
presented
himself
at
the
hall
with
a
small
and
a
great
many
apologies
found
myself
in
norwich
sir
everard
he
explained
i
have
done
business
there
all
my
life
and
one
of
my
customers
needed
looking
after
i
finished
early
and
when
i
found
that
i
was
only
thirty
miles
off
you
i
could
resist
having
a
run
across
if
it
is
in
any
way
inconvenient
to
put
me
up
for
the
night
say
so
my
dear
fellow
dominey
interrupted
there
are
a
score
of
rooms
ready
all
that
we
need
is
to
light
a
fire
and
an
will
do
the
rest
you
remember
mangan
the
two
men
shook
hands
and
seaman
accepted
a
little
refreshment
after
his
drive
he
lingered
behind
for
a
moment
after
the
dressing
bell
had
rung
what
time
is
that
fellow
going
he
asked
nine
morning
dominey
replied
not
a
word
until
then
seaman
whispered
back
i
must
not
seem
to
be
hanging
after
you
too
much
i
really
did
not
want
to
come
but
the
matter
is
we
can
send
mangan
to
bed
early
dominey
suggested
i
am
the
early
bird
myself
was
the
weary
reply
i
was
up
all
last
night
morning
will
dinner
that
night
was
a
pleasant
and
social
meal
mangan
especially
was
uplifted
everything
to
do
with
the
domineys
for
the
last
fifteen
years
had
reeked
of
poverty
he
had
really
had
a
hard
struggle
to
make
both
ends
meet
there
had
been
disagreeable
interviews
with
angry
tenants
formal
interviews
with
dissatisfied
mortgagees
and
remarkably
little
profit
at
the
end
of
the
year
to
set
against
these
disagreeable
episodes
the
new
situation
was
almost
beatific
the
concluding
touch
perhaps
was
in
parkins
congratulatory
whisper
as
he
set
a
couple
of
decanters
upon
the
table
i
have
found
a
bin
of
cockburn
sir
he
announced
including
the
lawyer
in
his
confidential
whisper
i
thought
you
might
like
to
try
a
couple
of
bottles
as
mangan
seems
rather
a
connoisseur
sir
the
corks
appear
to
be
in
excellent
after
this
mangan
sighed
it
will
be
hard
to
get
back
to
the
austere
life
of
a
pall
mall
club
seaman
very
early
in
the
evening
pleaded
an
extraordinary
sleepiness
and
retired
leaving
his
host
and
mangan
alone
over
the
port
dominey
although
an
attentive
host
seemed
a
little
abstracted
even
mangan
who
was
not
an
observant
man
was
conscious
that
a
certain
hardness
almost
arrogance
of
speech
and
manner
seemed
temporarily
to
have
left
his
patron
i
ca
tell
you
sir
everard
he
said
as
he
sipped
his
first
glass
of
wine
what
a
pleasure
it
is
to
me
to
see
as
it
were
this
recrudescence
of
an
old
family
if
i
might
be
allowed
to
say
so
only
one
thing
necessary
to
round
the
whole
business
off
as
it
and
that
dominey
asked
unthinkingly
the
return
of
lady
dominey
to
health
i
was
one
of
the
few
you
may
remember
privileged
to
make
her
acquaintance
at
the
time
of
your
i
paid
a
visit
this
morning
dominey
said
to
the
doctor
who
has
been
in
attendance
upon
her
since
her
marriage
he
agrees
with
me
that
there
is
no
reason
why
lady
dominey
should
not
in
course
of
time
be
restored
to
perfect
i
take
the
liberty
of
finishing
my
glass
to
that
hope
sir
everard
the
lawyer
murmured
both
glasses
were
set
down
empty
only
the
stem
of
dominey
was
snapped
in
two
mangan
expressed
his
polite
regrets
this
old
glass
he
murmured
looking
at
his
own
admiringly
becomes
very
dominey
did
not
answer
his
brain
had
served
him
a
strange
trick
in
the
shadows
of
the
room
he
had
fancied
that
he
could
see
stephanie
eiderstrom
holding
out
her
arms
calling
to
him
to
fulfill
the
pledges
of
long
ago
and
behind
her
have
you
ever
been
in
love
mangan
dominey
asked
his
companion
i
sir
well
i
not
sure
the
man
of
the
world
replied
a
little
startled
by
the
abruptness
of
the
question
it
an
way
of
looking
at
things
now
is
it
dominey
relapsed
into
thoughtfulness
i
suppose
so
he
admitted
that
night
a
storm
rolled
up
from
somewhere
across
that
grey
waste
of
waters
a
storm
heralded
by
a
wind
which
came
booming
over
the
marshes
shaking
the
latticed
windows
of
dominey
place
shrieking
and
wailing
amongst
its
chimneys
and
around
its
many
corners
black
clouds
leaned
over
the
land
and
drenching
streams
of
rain
dashed
against
the
sashes
of
the
windows
dominey
lit
the
tall
candles
in
his
bedroom
fastened
a
around
him
threw
himself
into
an
and
fixing
an
electric
reading
lamp
by
his
side
tried
to
read
very
soon
the
book
slipped
from
his
fingers
he
became
suddenly
tense
and
watchful
his
eyes
counted
one
by
one
the
panels
in
the
wall
by
the
side
of
the
bed
the
familiar
click
was
twice
repeated
for
a
moment
a
dark
space
appeared
then
a
woman
stooping
low
glided
into
the
room
she
came
slowly
towards
him
drawn
like
a
moth
towards
that
semicircle
of
candle
her
hair
hung
down
her
back
like
a
girl
and
the
white
which
floated
diaphanously
about
her
was
unexpectedly
reminiscent
of
bond
street
you
are
not
afraid
she
asked
anxiously
see
i
have
nothing
in
my
hands
i
almost
think
that
the
desire
has
gone
you
remember
the
little
stiletto
i
had
last
night
i
threw
it
into
the
well
unthank
was
very
angry
with
i
am
not
afraid
he
assured
her
but
ah
but
you
will
not
scold
me
she
begged
it
is
the
storm
which
terrifies
he
drew
a
low
chair
for
her
into
the
little
circle
of
light
and
arranged
some
cushions
as
she
sank
into
it
she
suddenly
looked
up
at
him
and
smiled
a
smile
of
rare
and
wonderful
beauty
dominey
felt
for
a
moment
something
like
the
stab
of
a
knife
at
his
heart
sit
here
and
rest
he
invited
there
is
nothing
to
in
my
heart
i
know
that
she
answered
simply
these
storms
are
part
of
our
lives
they
come
with
birth
and
they
shake
the
world
when
death
seizes
us
one
should
not
be
afraid
but
i
have
been
so
ill
everard
shall
i
call
you
everard
still
why
not
he
asked
because
you
are
not
like
everard
to
me
any
more
she
told
him
because
something
has
gone
from
you
and
something
has
come
to
you
you
are
not
the
same
man
what
is
it
had
you
troubles
in
africa
did
you
learn
what
life
was
like
out
there
he
sat
looking
at
her
for
a
moment
leaning
back
in
his
chair
which
he
had
pushed
a
few
feet
into
the
shadows
her
hair
was
glossy
and
splendid
and
against
it
her
skin
seemed
whiter
and
more
delicate
than
ever
her
eyes
were
lustrous
but
plaintive
and
with
something
of
the
child
fear
of
harm
in
them
she
looked
very
young
and
very
fragile
to
have
been
swayed
through
the
years
by
an
evil
passion
i
learnt
many
things
there
rosamund
he
told
her
quietly
i
learnt
a
little
of
the
difference
between
right
doing
and
wrongdoing
i
learnt
too
that
all
the
passions
of
life
burn
themselves
out
save
one
she
twisted
the
girdle
of
her
in
her
fingers
for
a
moment
his
last
speech
seemed
to
have
been
outside
the
orbit
of
her
comprehension
or
interest
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
me
any
more
everard
she
said
a
little
pathetically
i
have
no
fear
of
you
he
answered
then
why
do
you
bring
your
chair
forward
and
come
and
sit
a
little
nearer
to
me
she
asked
raising
her
eyes
do
you
hear
the
wind
how
it
shrieks
at
us
oh
i
am
afraid
he
moved
forward
to
her
side
and
took
her
hand
gently
in
his
her
fingers
responded
at
once
to
his
pressure
when
he
spoke
he
scarcely
recognised
his
own
voice
it
seemed
to
him
thick
and
choked
the
wind
shall
not
hurt
you
or
anything
else
he
promised
i
have
come
back
to
take
care
of
she
sighed
smiled
like
a
tired
child
and
her
eyes
closed
as
her
head
fell
farther
back
amongst
the
cushions
stay
just
like
that
please
she
begged
something
quite
new
is
coming
to
me
i
am
resting
it
is
the
sweetest
rest
i
ever
felt
move
everard
let
my
fingers
stay
in
yours
the
candles
burned
down
in
their
sockets
the
wind
rose
to
greater
furies
and
died
away
only
as
the
dawn
broke
through
the
storm
clouds
a
pale
light
stole
into
the
room
still
the
woman
slept
and
still
her
fingers
seemed
to
keep
their
clutch
upon
his
hand
her
breathing
was
all
the
time
soft
and
regular
her
silky
black
eyelashes
lay
motionless
upon
her
pale
cheeks
her
mouth
a
very
perfectly
shaped
mouth
rested
in
quiet
lines
somehow
he
realised
that
about
this
slumber
there
was
a
new
thing
with
hot
eyes
and
aching
limbs
he
sat
through
the
night
dream
after
dream
rose
up
and
passed
away
before
that
little
background
of
tapestried
wall
when
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
the
same
smile
parted
her
lips
as
the
smile
which
had
come
there
when
she
had
passed
away
to
sleep
i
am
so
rested
she
murmured
i
feel
so
well
i
have
had
dreams
beautiful
the
fire
had
burned
out
and
the
room
was
chilly
you
must
go
back
to
your
own
room
now
he
said
very
slowly
her
fingers
relaxed
she
held
out
her
arms
carry
me
she
begged
i
am
only
half
awake
i
want
to
sleep
he
lifted
her
up
her
fingers
closed
around
his
neck
her
head
fell
back
with
a
little
sigh
of
content
he
tried
the
folding
doors
and
finding
some
difficulty
in
opening
them
carried
her
out
into
the
corridor
into
her
own
room
and
laid
her
upon
the
untouched
bed
you
are
quite
comfortable
he
asked
quite
she
murmured
drowsily
kiss
me
her
hands
drew
his
face
down
his
lips
rested
upon
her
forehead
then
he
drew
the
bedclothes
over
her
and
fled
chapter

there
was
a
cloud
on
seaman
face
as
muffled
up
in
their
overcoats
he
and
his
host
walked
up
and
down
the
terrace
the
next
morning
after
the
departure
of
mangan
he
disclosed
his
mind
a
little
abruptly
in
a
few
minutes
he
said
i
shall
come
to
the
great
purpose
of
my
visit
i
have
great
and
wonderful
news
for
you
but
it
will
the
time
for
action
has
arrived
dominey
asked
curiously
i
hope
you
will
remember
that
as
yet
i
am
scarcely
established
it
is
with
regard
to
your
establishment
here
seaman
explained
drily
that
i
desire
to
say
a
word
we
have
seen
much
of
one
another
since
we
met
in
cape
town
the
passion
and
purpose
of
my
life
you
have
been
able
to
judge
of
those
interludes
which
are
necessary
to
a
human
being
unless
his
system
is
to
fall
to
pieces
as
dry
dust
you
have
also
seen
something
i
trust
you
will
not
misunderstand
me
when
i
say
that
apart
from
the
necessities
of
my
work
i
am
a
man
of
i
am
prepared
to
admit
it
dominey
murmured
a
little
idly
you
have
undertaken
a
great
enterprise
it
was
without
a
doubt
a
miraculous
piece
of
fortune
which
brought
the
englishman
dominey
to
your
camp
just
at
the
moment
when
you
received
your
orders
from
headquarters
your
plan
has
met
with
every
encouragement
from
us
you
will
be
placed
in
a
unique
position
to
achieve
your
final
purpose
now
mark
my
words
and
do
not
misunderstand
me
the
very
keynote
of
our
progress
is
ruthlessness
to
take
even
a
single
step
forward
towards
the
achievement
of
that
purpose
is
worth
the
sacrifice
of
all
the
scruples
and
delicacies
conceivable
but
when
a
certain
course
of
action
is
without
profit
to
our
purpose
i
see
ugliness
in
it
it
distresses
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
dominey
demanded
i
sleep
with
one
ear
open
seaman
replied
well
i
saw
you
leave
your
room
early
this
morning
seaman
continued
carrying
lady
dominey
in
your
there
were
little
streaks
of
pallor
underneath
the
tan
in
face
his
eyes
were
like
glittering
metal
it
was
only
when
he
had
breathed
once
or
twice
quickly
that
he
could
command
his
voice
what
concern
is
this
of
yours
he
demanded
seaman
gripped
his
companion
arm
look
here
he
said
we
are
too
closely
allied
for
bluff
i
am
here
to
help
you
fill
the
shoes
of
another
man
so
far
as
regards
his
estates
his
position
and
character
which
by
the
by
you
are
rehabilitating
i
will
go
further
i
will
admit
that
it
is
not
my
concern
to
interfere
in
any
ordinary
amour
you
might
undertake
but
i
shall
tell
you
this
my
friend
to
your
face
that
to
deceive
a
lady
of
weak
intellect
however
beautiful
to
make
use
of
your
position
as
her
supposed
husband
is
not
save
in
the
vital
interests
of
his
country
the
action
of
a
prussian
dominey
passion
seemed
to
have
burned
itself
out
without
expression
he
showed
not
the
slightest
resentment
at
his
companion
words
have
no
fear
seaman
he
enjoined
him
the
situation
is
delicate
but
i
can
deal
with
it
as
a
man
of
you
relieve
me
seaman
confessed
you
must
admit
that
the
spectacle
of
last
night
was
calculated
to
inspire
me
with
i
respect
you
for
your
plain
words
dominey
declared
the
fact
is
that
lady
dominey
was
frightened
of
the
storm
last
night
and
found
her
way
into
my
room
you
may
be
sure
that
i
treated
her
with
all
the
respect
and
sympathy
which
our
positions
lady
dominey
seaman
remarked
meditatively
seems
to
be
curiously
falsifying
certain
in
what
way
the
common
impression
in
the
neighbourhood
here
is
that
she
is
a
maniac
chiefly
upon
one
subject
her
detestation
of
you
she
has
been
known
to
take
an
oath
that
you
should
die
if
you
slept
in
this
house
again
you
naturally
being
a
brave
man
ignored
all
this
yet
in
the
morning
after
your
first
night
here
there
was
blood
upon
your
night
dominey
eyebrows
were
slowly
raised
you
are
well
served
here
he
observed
with
involuntary
sarcasm
that
for
your
own
sake
as
well
as
ours
is
necessary
was
the
terse
reply
to
continue
people
of
unsound
mind
are
remarkably
tenacious
of
their
ideas
there
was
certainly
nothing
of
the
murderess
in
her
demeanour
towards
you
last
night
can
not
you
see
that
a
too
friendly
attitude
on
her
part
might
become
fatal
to
our
schemes
in
what
way
if
ever
your
identity
is
doubted
seaman
explained
the
probability
of
which
is
i
must
confess
becoming
less
every
day
the
fact
that
lady
dominey
seems
to
have
so
soon
forgotten
all
her
enmity
towards
you
would
be
strong
presumptive
evidence
that
you
are
not
the
man
you
claim
to
ingenious
dominey
assented
and
very
possible
all
this
time
however
we
speak
on
what
you
yourself
admit
to
be
a
side
you
are
right
seaman
confessed
very
well
then
listen
a
great
moment
has
arrived
for
you
my
explain
if
you
i
shall
do
so
you
have
seen
proof
during
the
last
few
days
that
you
have
an
organisation
behind
you
to
whom
money
is
dross
it
is
the
same
in
diplomacy
as
in
war
germany
will
pay
the
price
for
what
she
intends
to
achieve
ninety
thousand
pounds
was
yesterday
passed
to
the
credit
of
your
account
for
the
extinction
of
certain
mortgages
in
a
few
or
a
few
years
time
some
distant
dominey
will
benefit
to
that
extent
we
can
not
recover
the
money
it
is
just
an
item
in
our
day
by
day
it
was
certainly
a
magnificent
way
of
establishing
me
dominey
admitted
magnificent
but
safest
in
the
long
run
seaman
declared
if
you
had
returned
a
poor
man
everybody
hand
would
have
been
against
you
suspicions
now
absolutely
unkindled
might
have
been
formed
and
more
important
perhaps
than
either
you
would
not
have
been
able
to
take
your
place
in
society
which
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
furtherance
of
our
is
it
not
almost
time
dominey
enquired
that
the
way
was
made
a
little
clearer
for
me
that
would
have
been
my
task
this
morning
seaman
replied
but
for
the
news
i
bring
in
passing
however
let
me
promise
you
this
you
will
never
be
asked
to
stoop
to
the
crooked
ways
of
the
ordinary
spy
we
want
you
for
a
different
and
the
news
what
must
be
the
greatest
desire
in
your
heart
seaman
said
solemnly
is
to
be
granted
the
kaiser
has
expressed
a
desire
to
see
you
to
give
you
his
instructions
in
dominey
stopped
short
upon
the
terrace
he
withdrew
his
arm
from
his
companion
and
stared
at
him
blankly
the
kaiser
he
exclaimed
you
mean
that
i
am
to
go
to
germany
we
shall
start
at
once
seaman
replied
personally
i
do
not
consider
the
proceeding
discreet
or
necessary
it
has
been
decided
upon
however
without
consulting
i
consider
it
suicidal
dominey
protested
what
explanation
can
i
possibly
make
for
going
to
germany
of
all
countries
in
the
world
before
i
have
had
time
to
settle
down
here
that
of
itself
will
not
be
difficult
his
companion
pointed
out
many
of
the
mines
in
which
a
share
has
been
bought
in
your
name
are
being
run
with
german
capital
it
is
easy
to
imagine
that
a
crisis
has
arisen
in
the
management
of
one
of
them
we
require
the
votes
of
our
fellow
shareholders
you
need
not
trouble
your
head
about
that
and
think
of
the
wonder
of
it
if
only
for
a
single
day
your
sentence
of
banishment
is
lifted
you
will
breathe
the
air
of
the
fatherland
once
it
will
be
wonderful
dominey
muttered
it
will
be
for
you
seaman
promised
a
breath
of
the
things
that
are
to
come
and
now
action
how
i
love
action
that
my
friend
and
your
it
was
arranged
that
the
two
men
should
leave
during
the
morning
for
norwich
by
and
thence
to
harwich
dominey
having
changed
into
travelling
clothes
sent
a
messenger
for
unthank
who
came
to
him
presently
in
his
study
he
held
out
a
chair
to
her
which
she
declined
however
to
take
mrs
unthank
he
said
i
should
like
to
know
why
you
have
been
content
to
remain
my
wife
attendant
for
the
last
ten
years
unthank
was
startled
by
the
suddenness
of
the
attack
lady
dominey
has
needed
me
she
answered
after
a
moment
pause
do
you
consider
he
asked
that
you
have
been
the
best
possible
companion
for
her
she
has
never
been
willing
to
accept
any
other
the
woman
replied
are
you
very
devoted
to
my
wife
he
enquired
unthank
grim
and
fierce
though
she
was
and
appeared
to
be
was
obviously
disconcerted
by
dominey
line
of
questions
if
i
were
she
demanded
should
i
have
been
here
all
these
years
i
scarcely
see
he
continued
what
particular
claim
my
wife
has
had
upon
you
i
understand
moreover
that
you
are
one
of
those
who
firmly
believe
that
i
killed
your
son
is
this
attendance
upon
my
wife
a
christian
act
then
the
returning
of
good
for
evil
exactly
what
do
you
want
to
say
to
me
sir
everard
she
asked
harshly
i
wish
to
say
this
dominey
replied
that
i
am
determined
to
bring
about
my
wife
restoration
to
health
for
that
reason
i
am
going
to
have
specialists
down
here
and
above
all
things
to
change
for
a
time
her
place
of
residence
my
own
feeling
is
that
she
will
stand
a
much
better
chance
of
recovery
without
your
you
would
dare
to
send
me
away
the
woman
demanded
that
is
my
intention
dominey
confessed
i
have
not
spoken
to
lady
dominey
yet
but
i
hope
that
very
soon
my
influence
over
her
will
be
such
that
she
will
be
content
to
obey
my
wishes
i
look
upon
your
future
from
the
financial
point
of
view
as
my
care
i
shall
settle
upon
you
the
sum
of
three
hundred
pounds
a
the
woman
showed
her
first
sign
of
weakness
she
began
to
shake
there
was
a
curious
look
of
fear
in
her
eyes
i
ca
leave
this
place
sir
everard
she
cried
i
must
stay
here
why
he
demanded
lady
dominey
could
do
without
me
she
answered
sullenly
that
he
replied
is
for
her
to
decide
personally
from
enquiries
i
have
made
i
believe
that
you
have
encouraged
in
her
that
ridiculous
superstition
about
the
ghost
of
your
son
i
also
believe
that
you
have
kept
alive
in
her
that
spirit
of
unreasonable
hatred
which
she
has
felt
towards
unreasonable
you
call
it
the
woman
almost
shouted
you
who
came
home
to
her
with
the
blood
on
your
hands
of
the
man
whom
if
only
you
had
kept
away
she
might
one
day
have
loved
unreasonable
you
call
it
i
have
finished
what
i
had
to
say
unthank
dominey
declared
i
am
compelled
by
important
business
to
leave
here
for
two
or
three
days
on
my
return
i
shall
embark
upon
the
changes
with
which
i
have
acquainted
you
in
the
meantime
he
added
watching
a
curious
change
in
the
woman
expression
i
have
written
this
morning
to
doctor
harrison
asking
him
to
come
up
this
afternoon
and
to
keep
lady
dominey
under
his
personal
observation
until
my
she
stood
quite
still
looking
at
him
then
she
came
a
little
nearer
and
leaned
forward
as
though
studying
his
face
eleven
years
she
muttered
do
change
many
men
but
i
never
knew
a
man
made
out
of
a
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
you
dominey
replied
except
to
let
you
know
that
i
am
coming
to
see
my
wife
in
the
space
of
a
few
the
was
already
sounding
below
when
dominey
was
admitted
to
his
wife
apartment
she
was
dressed
in
a
loose
gown
of
a
warm
crimson
colour
and
she
had
the
air
of
one
awaiting
his
arrival
expectantly
the
passion
of
hatred
seemed
to
have
passed
from
her
pale
face
and
from
the
depths
of
her
strangely
soft
eyes
she
held
out
her
hands
towards
him
her
brows
were
a
little
puckered
the
disappointment
of
a
child
lurked
in
her
manner
you
are
going
away
she
murmured
in
a
very
few
moments
he
told
her
i
have
been
waiting
to
see
you
for
an
she
made
a
grimace
it
was
unthank
i
think
that
she
hid
my
things
on
purpose
i
was
so
anxious
to
see
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
unthank
he
said
should
you
be
very
unhappy
if
i
sent
her
away
and
found
some
one
younger
and
kinder
to
be
your
companion
the
idea
seemed
to
be
outside
the
bounds
of
her
comprehension
mrs
unthank
would
never
go
she
declared
she
stays
here
to
listen
to
the
voice
all
night
long
sometimes
she
waits
and
listens
and
it
does
come
then
she
hears
it
and
she
is
and
you
he
asked
i
am
afraid
she
confessed
but
then
you
see
i
am
not
very
you
are
not
fond
of
unthank
he
enquired
anxiously
i
do
think
so
she
answered
in
a
perplexed
tone
i
think
i
am
very
much
afraid
of
her
but
it
is
no
use
everard
she
would
never
go
when
i
return
dominey
said
we
shall
she
took
his
arm
and
linked
her
hands
through
it
i
am
so
sorry
that
you
are
going
she
murmured
i
hope
you
will
soon
come
back
will
you
come
back
my
husband
dominey
nails
cut
into
the
flesh
of
his
clenched
hands
i
will
come
back
within
three
days
he
promised
do
you
know
she
went
on
confidentially
something
has
come
into
my
mind
lately
i
spoke
about
it
yesterday
but
i
did
not
tell
you
what
it
was
you
need
never
be
afraid
of
me
any
more
i
what
do
you
understand
he
demanded
huskily
the
knowledge
must
have
come
to
me
she
went
on
dropping
her
voice
a
little
and
whispering
almost
in
his
ear
at
the
very
moment
when
my
dagger
rested
upon
your
throat
when
i
suddenly
felt
the
desire
to
kill
die
away
you
are
very
like
him
sometimes
but
you
are
not
everard
you
are
not
my
husband
at
all
you
are
another
dominey
gave
a
little
gasp
they
both
turned
towards
the
door
unthank
was
standing
there
her
gaunt
hard
face
lit
up
with
a
gleam
of
something
which
was
like
triumph
her
eyes
glittering
her
lips
as
though
involuntarily
repeated
her
mistress
last
words
another
man
chapter
xiv
there
were
times
during
their
rapid
journey
when
seaman
studying
his
companion
became
thoughtful
dominey
seemed
indeed
to
have
passed
beyond
the
boundaries
of
any
ordinary
reserve
to
have
become
like
a
man
immeshed
in
the
toils
of
a
past
so
absorbing
that
he
moved
as
though
in
a
dream
speaking
only
when
necessary
and
comporting
himself
generally
like
one
to
whom
all
externals
have
lost
significance
as
they
embarked
upon
the
final
stage
of
their
travels

said
it

replied
to

in
germany
again
for
many
the
past
still
bites
the
train
sped
on
through
long
chains
of
hills
out
into
a
stretch
of
flat
country
into
forests
of
pines
in
the
midst
of
which
were
great
cleared
spaces
where
notwithstanding
the
closely
drawn
windows
the
resinous
odour
from
the
fallen
trunks
seemed
to
permeate
the
compartment
presently
they
slackened
speed
seaman
glanced
at
his
watch
and
rose
prepare
yourself
my
friend
he
said

descend
in
a
few

glanced
out
of
the
window
but
where
are

he
enquired
within
five
minutes
of
our
but
there
is
not
a
house
in
sight
dominey
remarked
wonderingly

will
be
received
on

private
train
seaman
announced
the
kaiser
with
his
staff
is
making
one
of
his
military
tours
we
are
honoured
by
being
permitted
to
travel
back
with
him
as
far
as
the
belgian
they
had
come
to
a
standstill
now
a
bearded
and
uniformed
official
threw
open
the
door
of
their
compartment
and
they
stepped
on
to
the
narrow
wooden
platform
of
a
small
station
which
seemed
to
have
been
recently
built
of
fresh
pine
planks
the
train
immediately
they
had
alighted
passed
on
their
journey
was
over
a
brief
conversation
was
carried
on
between
seaman
and
the
official
during
which
dominey
took
curious
note
of
his
surroundings
around
the
station
half
hidden
in
some
places
by
the
trees
and
shrubs
was
drawn
a
complete
cordon
of
soldiers
who
seemed
to
have
recently
disembarked
from
a
military
train
which
stood
upon
a
siding
in
the
middle
of
it
was
a
solitary
saloon
carriage
painted
black
with
much
gold
ornamentation
and
having
emblazoned
upon
the
central
panel
the
royal
arms
of
germany
seaman
when
he
had
finished
his
conversation
took
dominey
by
the
arm
and
led
him
across
the
line
towards
it
an
officer
received
them
at
the
steps
and
bowed
punctiliously
to
dominey
at
whom
he
gazed
with
much
interest
his
majesty
will
receive
you
at
once
he
announced
follow
they
boarded
the
train
and
passed
along
a
richly
carpeted
corridor
their
guide
paused
and
pointed
to
a
small
where
several
men
were
seated
herr
seaman
will
find
friends
there
he
said
his
imperial
majesty
will
receive
him
for
a
few
minutes
later
the
baron
von
ragastein
will
come
this
dominey
was
ushered
now
into
the
main
saloon
his
guide
motioned
him
to
remain
near
the
entrance
and
himself
advancing
a
few
paces
stood
at
the
salute
before
a
seated
figure
who
was
bending
over
a
map
which
a
man
in
the
uniform
of
a
general
had
unrolled
before
him
the
kaiser
glanced
up
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
whispered
something
in
the
general
ear
the
latter
clicked
his
heels
together
and
retired
the
kaiser
beckoned
dominey
to
advance
the
baron
von
ragastein
your
majesty
the
young
officer
murmured
dominey
stood
at
attention
for
a
moment
and
bowed
a
little
awkwardly
the
kaiser
smiled
it
pleases
me
he
said
to
see
a
german
officer
ill
at
ease
without
his
uniform
count
you
will
leave
us
baron
von
ragastein
be
sir
everard
dominey
at
your
service
majesty
dominey
replied
as
he
took
the
chair
to
which
his
august
host
pointed
thorough
in
all
things
i
see
the
latter
observed
sit
there
and
be
at
your
ease
good
reports
have
reached
me
of
your
work
in
i
did
my
best
to
execute
your
majesty
will
dominey
ventured
you
did
so
well
the
kaiser
pronounced
that
my
counsellors
were
unanimous
in
advising
your
withdrawal
to
what
will
shortly
become
the
great
centre
of
interest
from
the
moment
of
receiving
our
commands
you
appear
to
have
displayed
initiative
i
gather
that
your
personation
of
this
english
baronet
has
been
successfully
carried
through
up
to
the
present
your
important
though
your
work
in
africa
was
the
kaiser
continued
your
present
task
is
a
far
greater
one
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
for
these
few
minutes
without
reserve
first
though
drink
a
toast
with
from
a
mahogany
stand
at
his
elbow
the
kaiser
drew
out
a
bottle
of
moselle
filled
two
very
beautiful
glasses
passed
one
to
his
companion
and
raised
the
other
to
the
fatherland
he
said
to
the
fatherland
dominey
repeated
they
set
down
their
glasses
empty
the
kaiser
threw
back
the
grey
military
cloak
which
he
was
wearing
displaying
a
long
row
of
medals
and
decorations
his
fingers
still
toyed
with
the
stem
of
his
wineglass
he
seemed
for
a
moment
to
lose
himself
in
thought
his
hard
and
somewhat
cruel
mouth
was
tightly
closed
there
was
a
slight
frown
upon
his
forehead
he
was
sitting
upright
taking
no
advantage
of
the
cushioned
back
of
his
his
eyes
a
little
screwed
up
the
frown
deepening
for
quite
five
minutes
there
was
complete
silence
one
might
have
gathered
that
turning
aside
from
great
matters
he
had
been
devoting
himself
entirely
to
the
scheme
in
which
dominey
was
concerned
von
ragastein
he
said
at
last
i
have
sent
for
you
to
have
a
few
words
concerning
your
habitation
in
england
i
wish
you
to
receive
your
impressions
of
your
mission
from
my
own
your
majesty
does
me
great
honour
dominey
murmured
i
wish
you
to
consider
yourself
the
kaiser
continued
as
entirely
removed
from
the
limits
the
authority
and
the
duties
of
my
espionage
system
from
you
i
look
for
other
things
i
desire
you
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
your
assumed
position
as
a
typical
english
country
gentleman
i
desire
you
to
study
the
labour
question
the
irish
question
the
progress
of
this
national
service
scheme
and
other
social
movements
of
which
you
will
receive
notice
in
due
time
i
desire
a
list
compiled
of
those
writers
who
in
the
reviews
or
by
means
of
fiction
are
encouraging
the
suspicions
which
i
am
inclined
to
fancy
england
has
begun
to
entertain
towards
the
fatherland
these
things
are
all
on
the
fringe
of
your
real
mission
that
i
believe
our
admirable
friend
seaman
has
already
confided
to
you
it
is
to
seek
the
friendship
if
possible
the
intimacy
of
prince
the
kaiser
paused
and
once
more
his
eyes
wandered
to
the
landscape
which
rolled
away
from
the
windows
of
the
car
they
were
certainly
not
the
eyes
of
a
dreamer
and
yet
in
those
moments
they
seemed
filled
with
brooding
pictures
the
princess
has
already
received
me
graciously
dominey
confided
terniloff
is
the
dove
of
peace
the
kaiser
pronounced
he
carries
the
sprig
of
olive
in
his
mouth
my
statesmen
and
counsellors
would
have
sent
to
london
an
ambassador
with
sterner
qualities
i
preferred
not
terniloff
is
the
man
to
gull
fools
because
he
is
a
fool
himself
he
is
a
fit
ambassador
for
a
country
which
has
not
the
wit
to
arm
itself
on
land
as
well
as
by
sea
when
it
sees
a
nation
mightier
more
cultured
more
splendidly
led
than
its
own
creeping
closer
every
the
english
appear
to
put
their
whole
trust
in
their
navy
your
majesty
dominey
observed
tentatively
the
eyes
of
his
companion
flashed
his
lips
curled
contemptuously
fools
he
exclaimed
of
what
use
will
their
navy
be
when
my
sword
is
once
drawn
when
i
hold
the
coast
towns
of
calais
and
boulogne
when
my
cannon
command
the
straits
of
dover
the
days
of
insular
nations
are
passed
passed
as
surely
as
the
days
of
england
arrogant
supremacy
upon
the
the
kaiser
refilled
his
glass
and
dominey
in
some
months
time
von
ragastein
he
continued
you
will
understand
why
you
have
been
enjoined
to
become
the
friend
and
companion
of
terniloff
you
will
understand
your
mission
a
little
more
clearly
than
you
do
now
its
exact
nature
waits
upon
developments
you
can
at
all
times
trust
dominey
bowed
and
remained
silent
his
companion
continued
after
another
brief
spell
of
silent
brooding
von
ragastein
he
said
my
decree
of
banishment
against
you
was
a
just
one
the
morals
of
my
people
are
as
sacred
to
me
as
my
oath
to
win
for
them
a
mightier
empire
you
first
of
all
betrayed
the
wife
of
one
of
the
most
influential
noblemen
of
a
state
allied
to
my
own
and
then
in
the
duel
that
followed
you
slew
it
was
an
accident
your
majesty
dominey
pleaded
i
had
no
intention
of
even
wounding
the
the
kaiser
frowned
all
manner
of
excuses
were
loathsome
to
him
the
accident
should
have
happened
the
other
way
he
rejoined
sharply
i
should
have
lost
a
valuable
servant
but
it
was
your
life
which
was
forfeit
and
not
his
still
they
tell
me
that
your
work
in
africa
was
well
and
thoroughly
done
i
give
you
this
one
great
chance
of
rehabilitation
if
your
work
in
england
commends
itself
to
me
the
sentence
of
exile
under
which
you
suffer
shall
be
your
majesty
is
too
good
dominey
murmured
the
work
for
its
own
sake
will
command
my
every
effort
even
without
the
hope
of
that
the
kaiser
said
is
well
spoken
it
is
the
spirit
i
believe
with
which
every
son
of
my
empire
regards
the
future
i
think
that
they
too
more
especially
those
who
surround
my
person
have
felt
something
of
that
divine
message
which
has
come
to
me
for
many
years
i
have
for
the
sake
of
my
people
willed
peace
now
that
the
time
draws
near
when
heaven
has
shown
me
another
duty
i
have
no
fear
but
that
every
loyal
german
will
bow
his
head
before
the
lightnings
which
will
play
around
my
sword
and
share
with
me
the
iron
will
to
wield
it

stiffly
and
backed
down
the

the
kaiser
was
already
bending
once
more
over
the
map
seaman
who
was
waiting
outside
the
door
of
the
anteroom
called
him
in
and
introduced
him
to
several
members
of
the
suite
one
a
young
man
with
a
fixed
monocle
scars
upon
his
face
and
a
queer
carriage

at

little
strangely

met
some
years
ago
in
munich
baron
he
remarked
i

no

replied
stiffly

orders
of
my
imperial

i
wipe
from
my
mind
every
episode
or
reminiscence
of
my
former

knitted

stiffly
and
took
his

with
the
others

already
started

gazed
thoughtfully
out
of
the
window
seaman
who
was
waiting
about
for
his
audience
patted
him
on
the
arm
dear

he
said

that

not

off
when

sentence
of

against

will
be
annulled
you
will
have
expiated
that
crime
which
believe
me
although
i
do
not
venture
to
claim
a
place
amongst
them
none
of
your
friends

ever
regarded

light

a
smiling
steward

made
his
appearance
and
served
them
with

in
tall
glasses
the
senior
officer
there
who
had
now
seated
himself
opposite
to
dominey
raised
his
glass
and
bowed
to
the
baron

said

hoch
chapter
xv
sir
everard
dominey
baronet
the
latest
and
most
popular
recruit
to
norfolk
sporting
society
stood
one
afternoon
some
months
after
his
return
from
germany
at
the
corner
of
the
long
wood
which
stretched
from
the
ridge
of
hills
behind
almost
to
the
kitchen
gardens
of
the
hall
at
a
reasonable
distance
on
his
left
four
other
guns
were
posted
on
one
side
of
him
stood
middleton
leaning
on
his
ash
stick
and
listening
to
the
approach
of
the
beaters
on
the
other
seaman
curiously
out
of
place
in
his
dark
grey
suit
and
bowler
hat
the
old
keeper
whom
time
seemed
to
have
cured
of
all
his
apprehensions
was
softly
garrulous
and
very
happy
that
do
seem
right
to
have
a
squire
dominey
at
this
corner
he
observed
watching
a
high
cock
pheasant
come
crashing
down
over
their
heads
i
mind
when
the
squire
your
father
sir
gave
up
this
corner
one
day
to
lord
wendermere
whom
folks
called
one
of
the
finest
pheasant
shots
in
england
and
though
they
streamed
over
his
head
like
starlings
he
nowt
but
a
few
cripples
to
show
for
his
morning
come
out
with
a
bit
of
a
twist
from
the
left
do
they
dominey
remarked
repeating
his
late
exploit
they
do
that
sir
the
old
man
assented
and
no
one
but
a
dominey
seems
to
have
learnt
the
knack
of
dealing
with
them
proper
that
foreign
prince
so
they
say
is
well
on
to
his
birds
but
i
would
trust
him
at
this
the
old
man
moved
off
a
few
paces
to
some
higher
ground
to
watch
the
progress
of
the
beaters
through
the
wood
seaman
turned
to
his
companion
and
there
was
a
note
of
genuine
admiration
in
his
tone
my
friend
he
declared
you
are
a
miracle
you
seem
to
have
developed
the
dominey
touch
even
in
killing
you
must
remember
that
i
have
shot
higher
ones
in
hungary
was
the
easy
reply
i
am
not
a
sportsman
seaman
admitted
i
do
not
understand
sport
but
i
do
know
this
there
is
an
old
man
who
has
lived
on
this
land
since
the
day
of
his
birth
who
has
watched
you
shoot
reverently
and
finds
even
the
way
you
hold
your
gun
that
twist
of
the
birds
dominey
explained
is
simply
a
local
superstition
the
wood
ends
on
the
slant
and
they
seem
to
be
flying
more
to
the
left
than
they
really
seaman
gazed
steadfastly
for
a
moment
along
the
side
of
the
wood
her
grace
is
coming
he
said
she
seems
to
share
the
duke
dislike
of
me
and
she
is
too
great
a
lady
to
conceal
her
feelings
just
one
word
before
i
go
the
princess
eiderstrom
arrives
this
dominey
frowned
then
warned
by
the
keeper
shout
turned
around
and
killed
a
hare
my
friend
he
said
with
a
certain
note
of
challenge
in
his
tone
i
am
not
certain
that
you
have
told
me
all
that
you
know
concerning
the
princess
seaman
was
thoughtful
for
a
brief
space
of
time
you
are
right
he
admitted
i
have
not
it
is
a
fault
which
i
will
repair
he
strolled
away
to
the
next
stand
where
mangan
was
displaying
an
altogether
different
standard
of
proficiency
the
duchess
came
up
to
dominey
a
few
minutes
later
i
told
henry
i
should
stop
with
him
another
moment
she
declared
he
has
fired
off
about
forty
cartridges
and
wounded
one
henry
is
not
keen
dominey
remarked
although
i
think
you
are
a
little
hard
on
him
are
you
not
i
saw
him
bring
down
a
nice
cock
just
now
so
far
as
regards
the
birds
it
really
does
not
matter
they
are
all
going
the
duchess
was
very
smartly
tailored
in
clothes
of
brown
leather
mixture
she
wore
thick
shoes
and
gaiters
and
a
small
hat
she
was
looking
very
well
but
a
little
annoyed
i
hear
she
said
that
stephanie
is
coming
dominey
nodded
and
seemed
for
a
moment
intent
on
watching
the
flight
of
a
pigeon
which
kept
tantalisingly
out
of
range
she
is
coming
down
for
a
few
days
he
assented
i
am
afraid
that
she
will
be
bored
to
where
did
you
become
so
friendly
with
her
his
cousin
asked
curiously
the
first
time
we
ever
met
dominey
replied
was
in
the
carlton
grill
room
a
few
days
after
i
landed
in
england
she
mistook
me
for
some
one
else
and
we
parted
with
the
usual
apologies
i
met
her
the
same
night
at
carlton
house
terrace
she
is
related
to
the
terniloffs
and
we
came
across
one
another
pretty
often
after
that
during
the
short
time
i
was
in
yes
the
duchess
murmured
meditatively
that
is
another
of
the
little
surprises
you
seem
to
have
all
ready
dished
up
for
us
how
on
earth
did
you
become
so
friendly
with
the
german
ambassador
dominey
smiled
tolerantly
really
he
replied
there
is
not
anything
so
very
extraordinary
about
it
is
there
mr
seaman
my
partner
in
one
or
two
mining
enterprises
took
me
to
call
upon
him
he
is
very
interested
in
east
africa
politically
and
as
a
sportsman
our
conversations
seemed
to
interest
him
and
led
to
a
certain
intimacy
of
which
i
may
say
that
i
am
proud
i
have
the
greatest
respect
and
liking
for
the
so
have
i
caroline
agreed
i
think
he
charming
henry
declares
that
he
must
be
either
a
fool
or
a
henry
is
blinded
by
prejudice
dominey
declared
a
little
impatiently
he
can
not
imagine
a
german
who
feasts
with
any
one
else
but
the
do
get
annoyed
dear
she
begged
resting
her
fingers
for
a
moment
upon
his
coat
sleeve
i
admire
the
prince
immensely
he
is
absolutely
the
only
german
i
ever
met
whom
one
felt
instinctively
to
be
a
now
what
are
you
smiling
at
dominey
turned
a
perfectly
serious
face
towards
her
not
guilty
he
pleaded
i
saw
you
it
was
just
a
quaint
thought
you
are
rather
sweeping
are
you
not
caroline
i
generally
right
she
to
return
to
the
subject
of
well
do
you
know
whom
she
mistook
you
for
in
the
carlton
grill
room
tell
me
he
answered
evasively
she
mistook
you
for
a
baron
leopold
von
ragastein
caroline
continued
drily
von
ragastein
was
her
lover
in
hungary
he
fought
a
duel
with
her
husband
and
killed
him
the
kaiser
was
furious
and
banished
him
to
east
dominey
picked
up
his
and
handed
his
gun
to
middleton
the
beaters
were
through
the
wood
yes
i
remember
now
he
said
she
addressed
me
as
i
still
do
see
why
it
was
necessary
to
invite
her
here
his
companion
observed
a
little
petulantly
she
may
call
you
leopold
again
if
she
does
i
shall
be
deaf
dominey
promised
but
seriously
she
is
a
cousin
of
the
princess
terniloff
and
the
two
women
are
devoted
to
one
another
the
princess
hates
shooting
parties
so
i
thought
they
could
entertain
one
bosh
stephanie
will
monopolise
you
all
the
time
that
what
coming
you
are
not
suggesting
that
she
intends
seriously
to
put
me
in
the
place
of
my
double
dominey
asked
with
mock
alarm
oh
i
should
wonder
and
she
an
extraordinarily
attractive
woman
i
full
of
complaints
everard
there
that
other
horrible
little
man
seaman
you
know
that
the
very
sight
of
him
makes
henry
furious
i
am
quite
sure
that
he
never
expected
to
sit
down
at
the
same
table
with
i
am
really
sorry
about
that
dominey
assured
her
but
you
see
his
excellency
takes
a
great
interest
in
him
on
account
of
this
friendship
league
of
which
seaman
is
secretary
and
he
particularly
asked
to
have
him
well
you
must
admit
that
the
situation
is
a
little
awkward
for
henry
she
complained
next
to
lord
roberts
henry
is
practically
the
leader
of
the
national
service
movement
here
he
hates
germany
and
distrusts
every
german
he
ever
met
and
in
a
small
house
party
like
this
we
meet
the
german
ambassador
and
a
man
who
is
working
hard
to
lull
to
sleep
the
very
sentiments
which
henry
is
endeavouring
to
it
sounds
very
pathetic
dominey
admitted
with
a
smile
but
even
henry
likes
terniloff
and
after
all
it
is
stimulating
to
meet
opponents
of
course
he
likes
terniloff
caroline
assented
but
he
hates
the
things
he
stands
for
however
i
have
forgiven
you
everything
if
only
stephanie
were
coming
that
woman
is
really
beginning
to
irritate
me
she
always
seems
to
be
making
mysterious
references
to
some
sentimental
past
in
which
you
both
are
concerned
and
for
which
there
can
be
no
foundation
at
all
except
your
supposed
likeness
to
her
exiled
lover
why
you
never
met
her
until
that
day
at
the
carlton
she
was
a
complete
stranger
to
me
dominey
asserted
then
all
i
can
say
is
that
you
have
been
unusually
rapid
if
managed
to
create
a
past
in
something
under
three
months
caroline
pronounced
suspiciously
i
call
her
coming
here
a
most
proceeding
especially
as
this
is
practically
a
bachelor
they
had
arrived
at
the
next
stand
and
conversation
was
temporarily
suspended
a
flight
of
wild
duck
were
put
out
from
a
pool
in
the
wood
and
for
a
few
minutes
every
one
was
busy
middleton
watched
his
master
with
unabated
approval
you
most
as
good
as
the
old
squire
with
them
high
duck
sir
everard
he
said
that
true
very
few
can
touch
when
coming
out
nigh
to
the
pheasants
they
ca
believe
in
the
speed
of
do
you
think
sir
everard
shoots
as
well
as
he
did
before
he
went
to
africa
caroline
asked
middleton
touched
his
hat
and
turned
to
seaman
who
was
standing
in
the
background
better
your
grace
he
answered
as
i
was
saying
to
this
gentleman
here
early
this
morning
he
cooler
like
and
swings
more
level
have
known
his
touch
on
a
gun
anywhere
there
was
a
glint
of
admiration
in
seaman
eyes
the
beaters
came
through
the
wood
and
the
little
party
of
guns
gossiped
together
while
the
game
was
collected
terniloff
his
usual
pallor
chased
away
by
the
bracing
wind
and
the
pleasure
of
the
sport
was
affable
and
even
loquacious
he
had
great
estates
of
his
own
in
saxony
and
was
explaining
to
the
duke
his
manner
of
shooting
them
middleton
glanced
at
his
watch
there
another
hour
good
light
sir
he
said
would
you
care
about
a
partridge
drive
or
should
we
do
through
the
home
copse
if
i
might
make
a
suggestion
terniloff
observed
diffidently
most
of
the
pheasants
went
into
that
wood
just
across
the
there
was
a
moment
rather
curious
silence
dominey
had
turned
and
was
looking
towards
the
wood
in
question
as
though
fascinated
by
its
almost
blackness
and
density
middleton
had
dropped
some
game
he
was
carrying
and
was
muttering
to
himself
we
call
that
the
black
wood
dominey
said
calmly
and
i
am
rather
afraid
that
the
pheasants
who
find
their
way
there
claim
sanctuary
what
do
you
think
middleton
the
old
man
turned
his
head
slowly
and
looked
at
his
master
somehow
or
other
every
scrap
of
colour
seemed
to
have
faded
out
of
his
bronzed
face
his
eyes
were
filled
with
that
vague
horror
of
the
supernatural
common
amongst
the
peasant
folk
of
various
localities
his
voice
shook
the
old
fear
was
back
again
you
would
put
the
beaters
in
there
squire
he
faltered
not
that
there
one
of
them
would
have
we
stumbled
up
against
a
local
superstition
the
duke
enquired
that
not
altogether
local
your
grace
middleton
replied
as
the
squire
himself
will
tell
you
i
doubt
whether
there
a
beater
in
all
norfolk
would
go
through
the
black
wood
if
you
paid
him
red
gold
for
here
you
he
turned
to
the
beaters
who
were
standing
waiting
for
instructions
a
few
yards
away
there
were
a
dozen
of
them
stalwart
men
for
the
most
part
clad
in
rough
smocks
and
breeches
and
carrying
thick
sticks
there
one
of
the
gentlemen
here
middleton
announced
addressing
them
who
wants
to
know
if
you
go
through
the
black
wood
of
dominey
for
a
sovereign
apiece
watch
their
faces
your
now
then
lads
there
was
no
possibility
of
any
mistake
the
very
suggestion
seemed
to
have
taken
the
healthy
sunburn
from
their
cheeks
they
fumbled
with
their
sticks
uneasily
one
of
them
touched
his
hat
and
spoke
to
dominey
i
one
as
seen
it
sir
as
well
as
heard
he
said
i
sooner
give
up
my
farm
than
go
nigh
the
caroline
suddenly
passed
her
arm
through
dominey
there
was
a
note
of
distress
in
her
tone
henry
you
an
idiot
she
exclaimed
it
was
my
fault
everard
so
sorry
just
for
one
moment
i
had
forgotten
i
ought
to
have
stopped
henry
at
once
the
poor
man
has
no
dominey
arm
responded
for
a
moment
to
the
pressure
of
her
fingers
then
he
turned
to
the
beaters
well
no
one
is
going
to
ask
you
to
go
to
the
black
wood
he
promised
get
round
to
the
back
of
hunt
stubbles
and
bring
them
into
the
roots
and
then
over
into
the
park
we
will
line
the
park
fence
how
is
that
middleton
the
keeper
touched
his
hat
and
stepped
briskly
off
i
just
have
a
walk
with
them
myself
sir
he
said
them
birds
do
break
at
fuller
corner
i
see
if
i
can
flank
them
you
know
where
to
put
the
guns
dominey
nodded
one
and
all
the
beaters
were
walking
with
most
unaccustomed
speed
towards
their
destination
their
backs
were
towards
the
black
wood
terniloff
came
up
to
his
host
have
i
by
chance
been
terribly
tactless
he
asked
dominey
shook
his
head
you
asked
a
perfectly
natural
question
prince
he
replied
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
know
the
truth
near
that
wood
occurred
the
tragedy
which
drove
me
from
england
for
so
many
i
am
deeply
grieved
the
prince
began
it
is
false
sentiment
to
avoid
allusions
to
it
dominey
interrupted
i
was
attacked
there
one
night
by
a
man
who
had
some
cause
for
offence
against
me
we
fought
and
i
reached
home
in
a
somewhat
alarming
state
my
condition
terrified
my
wife
so
much
that
she
has
been
an
invalid
ever
since
but
here
is
the
point
which
has
given
birth
to
all
these
superstitions
and
which
made
me
for
many
years
a
suspected
person
the
man
with
whom
i
fought
has
never
been
seen
terniloff
was
at
once
too
fascinated
by
the
story
and
puzzled
by
his
host
manner
of
telling
it
to
maintain
his
apologetic
attitude
never
seen
since
he
repeated
my
own
memory
as
to
the
end
of
our
fight
is
uncertain
dominey
continued
my
impression
is
that
i
left
my
assailant
unconscious
upon
the
then
it
is
his
ghost
i
imagine
who
haunts
the
black
wood
dominey
shook
himself
as
one
who
would
get
rid
of
an
unwholesome
thought
the
wood
itself
prince
he
explained
as
they
walked
along
is
a
noisome
place
there
are
quagmires
even
in
the
middle
of
it
where
a
man
may
sink
in
and
be
never
heard
of
again
every
sort
of
vermin
abounds
there
every
unclean
insect
and
bird
are
to
be
found
in
the
thickets
i
suppose
the
character
of
the
place
has
encouraged
the
local
superstition
in
which
every
one
of
those
men
firmly
they
absolutely
believe
the
place
to
be
haunted
then
the
superstition
goes
further
dominey
continued
our
locals
say
that
somewhere
in
the
heart
of
the
wood
where
i
believe
that
no
human
being
for
many
years
has
dared
to
penetrate
there
is
living
in
the
spiritual
sense
some
sort
of
a
demon
who
comes
out
only
at
night
and
howls
underneath
my
has
any
one
ever
seen
it
one
or
two
of
the
villagers
to
the
best
of
my
belief
no
one
else
dominey
replied
terniloff
seemed
on
the
point
of
asking
more
questions
but
the
duke
touched
him
on
the
arm
and
drew
him
to
one
side
as
though
to
call
his
attention
to
the
sea
fogs
which
were
rolling
up
from
the
marshes
prince
he
whispered
the
details
of
that
story
are
inextricably
mixed
up
with
the
insanity
of
lady
dominey
i
am
sure
you
the
prince
a
diplomatist
to
his
fingertips
appeared
shocked
although
a
furtive
smile
still
lingered
upon
his
lips
i
regret
my
faux
pas
most
deeply
he
murmured
sir
everard
he
went
on
you
promised
to
tell
me
of
some
of
your
days
with
a
shotgun
in
south
africa
is
there
a
bird
there
which
corresponds
with
your
partridges
dominey
smiled
if
you
can
kill
the
partridges
which
middleton
is
going
to
send
over
in
the
next
ten
minutes
he
said
you
could
shoot
anything
of
the
sort
that
comes
along
in
east
africa
with
a
catapult
if
you
will
stand
just
a
few
paces
there
to
the
left
henry
terniloff
by
the
gate
stillwell
up
by
the
corner
mangan
next
eddy
next
and
i
shall
be
just
beyond
towards
the
oak
clump
will
you
walk
with
me
caroline
his
cousin
took
his
arm
as
they
walked
off
and
pressed
it
everard
i
congratulate
you
she
said
you
have
conquered
your
nerve
absolutely
you
did
a
simple
and
a
fine
thing
to
tell
the
whole
story
why
you
were
almost
i
could
even
have
imagined
you
were
telling
it
about
some
one
her
host
smiled
enigmatically
curious
that
it
should
have
struck
you
like
that
he
remarked
do
you
know
when
i
was
telling
it
i
had
the
same
do
you
mind
crouching
down
a
little
now
i
am
going
to
blow
the
chapter
xvi
even
in
the
great
of
dominey
hall
the
mahogany
table
which
was
its
great
glory
was
stretched
that
evening
to
its
extreme
capacity
besides
the
house
party
which
included
the
right
honourable
gerald
watson
a
recently
appointed
cabinet
minister
there
were
several
guests
from
the
neighbourhood
the
lord
lieutenant
of
the
county
and
other
notabilities
caroline
with
the
lord
lieutenant
on
one
side
of
her
and
terniloff
on
the
other
played
the
part
of
hostess
adequately
but
without
enthusiasm
her
eyes
seldom
left
for
long
the
other
end
of
the
table
where
stephanie
at
dominey
left
hand
with
her
crown
of
exquisitely
coiffured
hair
her
marvellous
jewellery
her
languorous
grace
of
manner
seemed
more
like
one
of
the
beauties
of
an
ancient
venetian
court
than
a
modern
hungarian
princess
gowned
in
the
rue
de
la
paix
conversation
remained
chiefly
local
and
concerned
the
day
sport
and
kindred
topics
it
was
not
until
towards
the
close
of
the
meal
that
the
duke
succeeded
in
launching
his
favourite
bubble
i
trust
everard
he
said
raising
his
voice
a
little
as
he
turned
towards
his
host
that
you
make
a
point
of
inculcating
the
principles
of
national
service
into
your
tenantry
dominey
reply
was
a
little
dubious
i
am
afraid
they
do
not
take
to
the
idea
very
kindly
in
this
part
of
the
world
he
confessed
purely
agricultural
districts
are
always
a
little
it
is
your
duty
as
a
landowner
the
duke
insisted
to
alter
their
point
of
view
there
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
he
added
looking
belligerently
over
the
top
of
his
at
seaman
who
was
seated
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
that
before
long
we
shall
find
ourselves
and
in
a
shocking
state
of
unpreparedness
mind
you
at
war
with
lady
maddeley
the
wife
of
the
lord
lieutenant
who
sat
at
his
side
seemed
a
little
startled
she
was
probably
one
of
the
only
people
present
who
was
not
aware
of
the
duke
foible
do
you
really
think
so
she
asked
the
germans
seem
such
civilised
people
so
peaceful
and
domestic
in
their
home
life
and
that
sort
of
the
duke
groaned
he
glanced
down
the
table
to
be
sure
that
prince
terniloff
was
out
of
hearing
my
dear
lady
maddeley
he
declared
germany
is
not
governed
like
england
when
the
war
comes
the
people
will
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
a
great
many
of
them
will
be
just
as
surprised
as
you
will
be
but
they
will
fight
all
the
seaman
who
had
kept
silence
during
the
last
few
moments
with
great
difficulty
now
took
up
the
duke
challenge
permit
me
to
assure
you
madam
he
said
bowing
across
the
table
that
the
war
with
germany
of
which
the
duke
is
so
afraid
will
never
come
i
speak
with
some
amount
of
knowledge
because
i
am
a
german
by
birth
although
naturalised
in
this
country
i
have
as
many
and
as
dear
friends
in
berlin
as
in
london
and
with
the
exception
of
my
recent
absence
in
africa
where
i
had
the
pleasure
to
meet
our
host
i
spent
a
great
part
of
my
time
going
back
and
forth
between
the
two
capitals
i
have
also
the
honour
to
be
the
secretary
of
a
society
for
the
promotion
of
a
better
understanding
between
the
citizens
of
germany
and
rubbish
the
duke
exclaimed
the
germans
do
want
a
better
understanding
they
only
want
to
fool
us
into
believing
that
they
seaman
looked
a
little
pained
he
stuck
to
his
guns
however
his
grace
and
i
he
observed
are
old
opponents
on
this
we
are
indeed
the
duke
agreed
you
may
be
an
honest
man
mr
seaman
but
you
are
a
very
ignorant
one
upon
this
particular
you
are
probably
both
right
in
your
way
dominey
intervened
very
much
in
the
manner
of
a
host
making
his
usual
effort
to
smooth
over
two
widely
divergent
points
of
view
there
is
no
doubt
a
war
party
in
germany
and
a
peace
party
statesmen
who
place
economic
progress
first
and
others
who
are
tainted
with
a
purely
military
lust
for
conquest
in
this
country
it
is
very
hard
for
us
to
strike
a
balance
between
the
seaman
beamed
his
thanks
upon
his
host
i
have
friends
he
said
impressively
in
the
very
highest
circles
of
germany
who
are
continually
encouraging
my
work
here
and
i
have
received
the
benediction
of
the
kaiser
himself
upon
my
efforts
to
promote
a
better
feeling
in
this
country
and
if
you
will
forgive
my
saying
so
duke
it
is
such
and
statements
as
you
are
constantly
making
about
my
country
which
is
the
only
bar
to
a
better
understanding
between
i
have
my
views
the
duke
snapped
and
they
have
become
convictions
i
shall
continue
to
express
them
at
all
times
and
with
all
the
eloquence
at
my
the
ambassador
to
whom
portions
of
this
conversation
had
now
become
audible
leaned
a
little
forward
in
his
place
let
me
speak
first
as
a
private
individual
he
begged
and
express
my
opinion
that
war
between
our
two
countries
would
be
simply
race
suicide
an
indescribable
and
an
abominable
crime
then
i
will
remember
what
i
represent
over
here
and
i
will
venture
to
add
in
my
ambassadorial
capacity
that
i
come
with
an
absolute
and
heartfelt
mandate
of
peace
my
task
over
here
is
to
secure
and
ensure
caroline
flashed
a
warning
glance
at
her
husband
how
nice
of
you
to
be
so
frank
prince
she
said
the
duke
sometimes
forgets
in
the
pursuit
of
his
hobby
that
a
private
dinner
table
is
not
a
platform
i
insist
upon
it
that
we
discuss
something
of
more
genuine
there
is
a
more
vital
subject
in
the
world
the
duke
declared
resigning
himself
however
to
silence
we
will
speak
the
ambassador
suggested
of
the
way
in
which
our
host
brought
down
those
tall
you
will
tell
me
perhaps
seaman
suggested
to
the
lady
to
his
right
how
you
english
women
have
been
able
to
secure
for
yourselves
so
much
more
liberty
than
our
german
wives
enjoy
later
on
stephanie
whispered
to
her
host
with
a
little
tremble
in
her
voice
i
have
a
surprise
for
after
dinner
dominey
guests
passed
naturally
enough
to
the
relaxations
which
each
preferred
there
were
two
bridge
tables
terniloff
and
the
cabinet
minister
played
billiards
and
seaman
with
a
touch
which
amazed
every
one
drew
strange
music
from
the
yellow
keys
of
the
grand
piano
in
the
stephanie
and
her
host
made
a
slow
progress
through
the
hall
and
picture
gallery
for
some
time
their
conversation
was
engaged
solely
with
the
objects
to
which
dominey
drew
his
companion
attention
when
they
had
passed
out
of
possible
hearing
however
of
any
of
the
other
guests
fingers
tightened
upon
her
companion
arm
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
alone
she
said
without
the
possibility
of
any
one
dominey
hesitated
and
looked
behind
your
guests
are
well
occupied
she
continued
a
little
impatiently
and
in
any
case
i
am
one
of
them
i
claim
your
dominey
threw
open
the
door
of
the
library
and
turned
on
a
couple
of
the
electric
lights
she
made
her
way
to
the
great
open
fireplace
on
which
a
log
was
burning
looked
down
into
the
shadows
of
the
room
and
back
again
at
her
host
face
for
one
moment
she
begged
turn
on
all
the
lights
i
wish
to
be
sure
that
we
are
dominey
did
as
he
was
bidden
the
furthermost
corners
of
the
room
with
its
many
wings
of
shelves
were
illuminated
she
nodded
now
turn
them
all
out
again
except
this
one
she
directed
and
wheel
me
up
an
no
i
choose
this
settee
please
seat
yourself
by
my
is
this
going
to
be
serious
he
asked
with
some
slight
disquietude
serious
but
wonderful
she
murmured
lifting
her
eyes
to
his
will
you
please
listen
to
me
leopold
she
was
half
curled
up
in
a
corner
of
the
settee
her
head
resting
slightly
upon
her
long
fingers
her
brown
eyes
steadily
fixed
upon
her
companion
there
was
an
atmosphere
about
her
of
serious
yet
of
tender
things
dominey
face
seemed
to
fall
into
more
rigid
lines
as
he
realised
the
appeal
of
her
eyes
leopold
she
began
i
left
this
country
a
few
weeks
ago
feeling
that
you
were
a
brute
determined
never
to
see
you
again
half
inclined
to
expose
you
before
i
went
as
an
impostor
and
a
charlatan
germany
means
little
to
me
and
a
patriotism
which
took
no
account
of
human
obligations
left
me
absolutely
unresponsive
i
meant
to
go
home
and
never
to
return
to
london
my
heart
was
bruised
and
i
was
very
she
paused
but
her
companion
made
no
sign
she
paused
for
so
long
however
that
speech
became
necessary
you
are
speaking
princess
he
said
calmly
to
one
who
is
not
present
my
name
is
no
longer
she
laughed
at
him
with
a
curious
mixture
of
tenderness
and
bitterness
my
friend
she
continued
i
am
terrified
to
think
besides
your
name
how
much
of
humanity
you
have
lost
in
your
new
identity
to
proceed
it
suited
my
convenience
to
remain
for
a
few
days
in
berlin
and
i
was
therefore
compelled
to
present
myself
at
potsdam
there
i
received
a
great
surprise
wilhelm
spoke
to
me
of
you
and
though
alas
my
heart
is
still
bruised
he
helped
me
to
is
this
wise
he
asked
a
little
desperately
she
ignored
his
words
i
was
taken
back
into
favour
at
court
she
went
on
for
that
i
owe
to
you
my
thanks
wilhelm
was
much
impressed
by
your
recent
visit
to
him
and
by
the
way
in
which
you
have
established
yourself
here
he
spoke
also
with
warm
commendation
of
your
labours
in
africa
which
he
seemed
to
appreciate
all
the
more
as
you
were
sent
there
an
exile
he
asked
me
leopold
she
added
dropping
her
voice
a
little
if
my
feelings
towards
you
remained
dominey
face
remained
unrelaxed
persistently
he
refused
the
challenge
of
her
eyes
i
told
him
the
truth
she
proceeded
i
told
him
how
it
all
began
and
how
it
must
last
with
me
to
the
end
we
spoke
even
of
the
duel
i
told
him
what
both
your
seconds
had
explained
to
me
that
turn
of
the
wrist
conrad
wild
lunge
how
he
literally
threw
himself
upon
the
point
of
your
sword
wilhelm
understands
and
forgives
and
he
has
sent
you
this
she
drew
a
small
grey
envelope
from
her
pocket
on
the
seal
were
the
imperial
hohenzollern
arms
she
passed
it
to
him
leopold
she
whispered
please
read
he
shook
his
head
although
he
accepted
the
letter
with
reluctant
fingers
read
the
superscription
she
directed
he
obeyed
her
it
was
addressed
in
a
strange
straggling
handwriting
to
everard
dominey
he
broke
the
seal
unwillingly
and
drew
out
the
letter
it
was
dated
barely
a
fortnight
back
there
was
neither
beginning
or
ending
just
a
couple
of
sentences
scrawled
across
the
thick
notepaper
it
is
my
will
that
you
offer
your
hand
in
marriage
to
the
princess
stephanie
of
eiderstrom
your
union
shall
be
blessed
by
the
church
and
approved
by
my
court
dominey
sat
as
a
man
enthralled
with
silence
she
watched
him
not
on
your
knees
yet
she
asked
with
faint
but
somewhat
resentful
irony
can
it
be
leopold
that
you
have
lost
your
love
for
me
you
have
changed
so
much
and
in
so
many
ways
has
the
love
gone
even
to
himself
his
voice
sounded
harsh
and
unnatural
his
words
instinct
with
the
graceless
cruelty
of
a
clown
this
is
not
practical
he
declared
think
i
am
as
i
have
been
addressed
here
and
as
i
must
remain
yet
for
months
to
come
everard
dominey
an
englishman
and
the
owner
of
this
house
the
husband
of
lady
where
is
your
reputed
wife
stephanie
demanded
frowning
in
the
nursing
home
where
she
has
been
for
the
last
few
months
he
replied
she
has
already
practically
recovered
she
can
not
remain
there
much
you
must
insist
upon
it
that
she
i
ask
you
to
consider
the
suspicions
which
would
be
excited
by
such
a
course
dominey
pleaded
earnestly
and
further
can
you
explain
to
me
in
what
way
i
having
already
according
to
belief
of
everybody
another
wife
living
can
take
advantage
of
this
mandate
she
looked
at
him
wonderingly
you
make
difficulties
you
sit
there
like
the
cold
englishman
whose
place
you
are
taking
you
whose
tears
have
fallen
before
now
upon
my
hand
whose
lips
you
speak
of
one
who
is
dead
dominey
interrupted
dead
until
the
coming
of
great
events
may
bring
him
to
life
again
until
that
time
your
lover
must
be
then
her
anger
blazed
out
she
spoke
incoherently
passionately
dragged
his
face
down
to
hers
and
clenched
her
fist
the
next
moment
as
though
she
would
have
struck
it
she
broke
down
with
a
storm
of
tears
not
so
hard
not
so
hard
leopold
she
implored
oh
yours
is
a
great
task
and
you
must
carry
it
through
to
the
end
but
we
have
his
permission
there
can
be
found
a
way
we
could
be
married
secretly
at
least
your
lips
your
arms
my
heart
is
starved
he
rose
to
his
feet
her
arms
were
still
twined
about
his
neck
her
lips
hungry
for
his
kisses
her
eyes
shining
up
into
his
have
pity
on
me
stephanie
he
begged
until
our
time
has
come
there
is
dishonour
even
in
a
single
kiss
wait
for
the
day
the
day
you
know
she
unwound
her
arms
and
shivered
slightly
her
hurt
eyes
regarded
him
wonderingly
leopold
she
faltered
what
has
changed
you
like
this
what
has
dried
up
all
the
passion
in
you
you
are
a
different
man
let
me
look
at
she
caught
him
by
the
shoulders
dragged
him
underneath
the
electric
globe
and
stood
there
gazing
into
his
face
the
great
log
upon
the
hearth
was
spluttering
and
fizzing
through
the
closed
door
came
the
faint
wave
of
conversation
and
laughter
from
outside
her
breathing
was
uneven
her
eyes
were
seeking
to
rend
the
mask
from
his
face
can
you
have
learnt
to
care
for
any
one
else
she
muttered
there
were
no
women
in
africa
this
rosamund
dominey
your
reputed
wife
they
tell
me
that
she
is
beautiful
that
you
have
been
kindness
itself
to
her
that
her
health
has
improved
since
your
coming
that
she
adores
you
you
would
dare
no
he
interrupted
i
should
not
then
what
are
you
looking
at
she
demanded
tell
me
that
her
eyes
were
following
the
shadowed
picture
which
had
passed
out
of
the
room
he
saw
once
more
the
slight
girlish
form
the
light
in
those
pleading
dark
eyes
the
tremulous
lips
the
whole
sweet
appeal
for
safety
from
a
frightened
child
to
him
the
strong
man
he
felt
the
clinging
touch
of
those
soft
fingers
laid
upon
his
the
sweetness
of
those
marvellously
awakened
emotions
so
cruelly
and
drearily
stifled
through
a
cycle
of
years
the
woman
passion
by
his
side
seemed
suddenly
tawdry
and
unreal
the
seeking
of
her
lips
for
his
something
horrible
his
back
was
towards
the
door
and
it
was
her
cry
of
angry
dismay
which
first
apprised
him
of
a
welcome
intruder
he
swung
around
to
find
seaman
standing
upon
the
threshold
seaman
to
him
a
very
angel
of
deliverance
i
am
indeed
sorry
to
intrude
sir
everard
the
newcomer
declared
with
a
shade
of
genuine
concern
on
his
round
face
something
has
happened
which
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
at
once
can
you
spare
me
a
moment
the
princess
swept
past
them
without
a
word
of
farewell
or
a
backward
glance
she
had
the
carriage
and
the
air
of
an
insulted
queen
a
shade
of
deeper
trouble
came
into
seaman
face
as
he
stepped
respectfully
to
one
side
what
is
it
that
has
happened
dominey
demanded
lady
dominey
has
returned
was
the
quiet
reply
chapter
xvii
it
seemed
to
dominey
that
he
had
never
seen
anything
more
pathetic
than
that
eager
glance
half
of
hope
half
of
apprehension
flashed
upon
him
from
the
strange
tired
eyes
of
the
woman
who
was
standing
before
the
log
fire
in
a
little
recess
of
the
main
hall
by
her
side
stood
a
pleasant
friendly
looking
person
in
the
uniform
of
a
nurse
a
yard
or
two
behind
a
maid
carrying
a
jewel
case
rosamund
who
had
thrown
back
her
veil
had
been
standing
with
her
foot
upon
the
fender
her
whole
expression
changed
as
dominey
came
hastily
towards
her
with
outstretched
hands
my
dear
child
he
exclaimed
welcome
home
welcome
she
repeated
with
a
glad
catch
in
her
throat
you
mean
it
with
a
of
which
he
gave
no
sign
he
touched
the
lips
which
were
raised
so
eagerly
to
his
as
tenderly
and
reverently
as
though
this
were
some
strange
child
committed
to
his
care
of
course
i
mean
it
he
answered
heartily
but
what
possessed
you
to
come
without
giving
us
notice
how
was
this
nurse
her
ladyship
has
had
no
sleep
for
two
nights
the
latter
replied
she
has
been
so
much
better
that
we
dreaded
the
thought
of
a
relapse
so
coulson
our
matron
thought
it
best
to
let
her
have
her
own
way
about
coming
instead
of
telegraphing
to
you
unfortunately
we
telegraphed
to
doctor
harrison
and
i
believe
he
is
is
it
very
wrong
of
me
rosamund
asked
clinging
to
dominey
arm
i
had
a
sudden
feeling
that
i
must
get
back
here
i
wanted
to
see
you
again
every
one
has
been
so
sweet
and
kind
at
falmouth
especially
nurse
alice
here
but
they
were
quite
the
same
thing
you
are
not
angry
these
people
who
are
staying
here
will
not
mind
of
course
not
he
assured
her
cheerfully
they
will
be
your
guests
you
must
make
friends
with
them
there
was
a
very
beautiful
woman
she
said
timidly
with
red
hair
who
passed
by
just
now
she
looked
very
angry
that
was
not
because
i
have
come
why
should
it
be
he
answered
you
have
a
right
here
a
better
right
than
any
she
drew
a
long
sigh
of
contentment
oh
but
this
is
wonderful
she
cried
and
you
dear
i
shall
call
you
everard
may
i
you
look
just
as
i
hoped
you
might
will
you
take
me
upstairs
please
nurse
you
can
follow
she
leaned
heavily
on
his
arm
and
even
loitered
on
the
way
but
her
steps
grew
lighter
as
they
approached
her
own
apartment
finally
as
they
reached
the
corridor
she
broke
away
from
him
and
tripped
on
with
the
gaiety
almost
of
a
child
to
the
door
of
her
room
then
came
a
little
cry
of
disappointment
as
she
flung
open
the
door
several
maids
were
there
busy
with
a
refractory
fire
and
removing
the
covers
from
the
furniture
but
the
room
was
half
full
of
smoke
and
entirely
unprepared
oh
how
miserable
she
exclaimed
everard
what
shall
i
do
he
threw
open
the
door
of
his
own
apartment
a
bright
fire
was
burning
in
the
grate
the
room
was
warm
and
comfortable
she
threw
herself
with
a
little
cry
of
delight
into
the
huge
chesterfield
drawn
up
to
the
edge
of
the
hearthrug
i
can
stay
here
everard
ca
i
until
you
come
up
to
bed
she
pleaded
and
then
you
can
sit
and
talk
to
me
and
tell
me
who
is
here
and
all
about
the
people
you
have
no
idea
how
much
better
i
am
all
my
music
has
come
back
to
me
and
they
say
that
i
play
bridge
ever
so
well
i
shall
love
to
help
you
the
maid
was
slowly
unfastening
her
mistress
boots
rosamund
held
up
her
foot
for
him
to
feel
see
how
cold
i
am
she
complained
please
rub
it
i
am
going
to
have
some
supper
up
here
with
nurse
will
one
of
you
maids
please
go
down
and
see
about
it
what
a
lot
of
nice
new
things
you
have
everard
she
added
looking
around
and
that
picture
of
me
from
the
on
the
table
she
cried
her
eyes
suddenly
soft
with
joy
you
dear
thing
what
made
you
bring
that
up
i
wanted
to
have
it
here
he
told
her
i
not
so
nice
as
that
now
she
sighed
a
little
wistfully
do
not
believe
it
he
answered
you
have
not
changed
in
the
least
you
will
be
still
when
you
have
been
here
for
a
few
she
looked
at
him
almost
shyly
tenderly
yet
still
with
that
gleam
of
aloofness
in
her
eyes
i
think
she
murmured
i
shall
be
just
what
you
want
me
to
be
i
think
you
could
make
me
just
what
you
want
be
very
kind
to
me
please
she
begged
stretching
her
arms
out
to
him
i
suppose
it
is
because
i
have
been
ill
so
long
but
i
feel
so
helpless
and
i
love
your
strength
and
i
want
you
to
take
care
of
me
your
own
hands
are
quite
cold
she
added
anxiously
you
look
pale
too
you
not
ill
everard
i
am
very
well
he
assured
her
struggling
to
keep
his
voice
steady
forgive
me
now
wo
you
if
i
hurry
away
there
are
guests
here
rather
important
guests
you
must
come
and
see
them
and
help
you
and
help
dominey
made
his
escape
and
went
reeling
down
the
corridor
at
the
top
of
the
great
quadrangular
landing
he
stopped
and
stood
with
eyes
for
several
moments
from
downstairs
he
could
hear
the
sound
of
pleasantly
raised
voices
the
music
of
a
piano
in
the
distance
the
click
of
billiard
balls
he
waited
until
he
had
regained
his
then
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
descending
he
saw
seaman
mounting
the
stairs
at
a
gesture
he
waited
for
him
waited
until
he
came
and
taking
him
by
the
arm
led
him
to
a
great
settee
in
a
dark
corner
seaman
had
lost
his
usual
blitheness
the
smile
played
no
longer
about
his
lips
where
is
lady
dominey
he
asked
in
my
room
waiting
until
her
own
is
seaman
manner
was
unusually
grave
my
friend
he
said
you
know
very
well
that
when
we
walk
in
the
great
paths
of
life
i
am
unscrupulous
in
those
other
hours
alas
i
have
a
weakness
i
love
well
dominey
muttered
i
will
admit
the
other
continued
that
you
are
placed
in
a
delicate
and
trying
position
lady
dominey
seems
disposed
to
offer
to
you
the
affection
which
notwithstanding
their
troubles
together
she
doubtless
felt
for
her
husband
i
risk
your
anger
my
friend
but
i
warn
you
to
be
very
careful
how
you
encourage
a
light
flashed
in
dominey
eyes
for
the
moment
angry
words
seemed
to
tremble
upon
his
lips
seaman
manner
however
was
very
gentle
he
courted
no
offence
if
you
were
to
take
advantage
of
your
position
with
with
any
other
i
would
shrug
my
shoulders
and
stand
on
one
side
but
this
mad
englishman
wife
or
rather
his
widow
has
been
mentally
she
is
still
just
as
she
is
i
watched
her
as
she
passed
through
the
hall
with
you
just
now
she
turns
to
you
for
love
as
a
flower
to
the
sun
after
a
long
spell
of
cold
wet
weather
von
ragastein
you
are
a
man
of
honour
you
must
find
means
to
deal
with
this
situation
however
difficult
it
may
dominey
had
recovered
from
his
first
wave
of
weakness
his
words
excited
no
sentiment
of
anger
he
was
conscious
even
of
regarding
him
with
a
greater
feeling
of
kindness
than
ever
before
my
friend
he
said
you
have
shown
me
that
you
are
conscious
of
one
dilemma
in
which
i
find
myself
placed
and
which
i
confess
is
exercising
me
to
the
utmost
let
me
now
advise
you
of
another
the
princess
eiderstrom
has
brought
me
an
autograph
letter
from
the
kaiser
commanding
me
to
marry
the
situation
seaman
declared
grimly
but
for
its
serious
side
would
provide
all
the
elements
for
a
palais
royal
farce
for
the
present
however
you
have
duties
below
i
have
said
the
words
which
were
thumping
against
the
walls
of
my
their
descent
was
opportune
some
of
the
local
guests
were
preparing
to
make
their
departure
and
dominey
was
in
time
to
receive
their
adieux
they
all
left
messages
for
lady
dominey
spoke
of
a
speedy
visit
to
her
and
expressed
themselves
as
delighted
to
hear
of
her
return
and
recovery
as
the
last
car
rolled
away
caroline
took
her
host
arm
and
led
him
to
a
chimney
seat
by
the
huge
log
fire
in
the
inner
hall
my
dear
everard
she
said
you
really
are
a
very
terrible
exactly
why
he
demanded
your
devotion
to
my
sex
she
continued
is
flattering
but
far
too
catholic
your
return
to
england
appears
to
have
done
what
we
understood
to
be
impossible
restored
your
wife
reason
a
hungarian
princess
has
pursued
you
down
here
and
has
now
gone
to
her
room
in
a
tantrum
because
you
left
her
side
for
a
few
minutes
to
welcome
your
wife
and
there
remains
our
own
sentimental
little
flirtation
a
broken
and
alas
a
discarded
thing
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
everard
that
you
are
a
very
bad
you
are
distressing
me
terribly
dominey
confessed
but
all
the
same
after
a
somewhat
agitated
evening
i
must
admit
that
i
find
it
pleasant
to
talk
with
some
one
who
is
not
wielding
the
lightnings
may
i
have
a
whisky
and
soda
bring
me
one
too
please
caroline
begged
i
fear
that
it
will
seriously
impair
the
note
which
i
had
intended
to
strike
in
our
conversation
but
i
am
thirsty
and
a
handful
of
those
turkish
cigarettes
too
you
can
devote
yourself
to
me
with
a
perfectly
clear
conscience
your
most
distinguished
guest
has
found
a
task
after
his
own
heart
he
has
got
henry
in
a
corner
of
the
and
is
trying
to
convince
him
of
what
i
am
sure
the
dear
man
really
believes
himself
that
germany
intentions
towards
england
are
of
a
particularly
nature
your
right
honourable
guest
has
gone
to
bed
and
eddy
pelham
is
playing
billiards
with
mangan
every
one
is
happy
you
can
devote
yourself
to
soothing
my
wounded
vanity
to
say
nothing
of
my
broken
always
gibing
at
me
dominey
grumbled
not
always
she
answered
quietly
raising
her
eyes
for
a
moment
there
was
a
time
everard
before
that
terrible
tragedy
the
last
time
you
stayed
at
dunratter
when
i
did
when
on
the
contrary
you
were
sweetness
itself
he
reflected
she
sighed
reminiscently
that
was
a
wonderful
month
she
murmured
i
think
it
was
then
for
the
first
time
that
i
saw
traces
of
something
in
you
which
i
suppose
accounts
for
your
being
what
you
are
you
think
that
i
have
changed
then
she
looked
him
in
the
eyes
i
sometimes
find
it
difficult
to
believe
she
admitted
that
you
are
the
same
he
turned
away
to
reach
for
his
whisky
and
soda
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
he
asked
why
to
begin
with
then
she
commented
you
have
become
almost
a
precisian
in
your
speech
you
used
to
be
rather
slangy
at
what
else
you
used
always
to
clip
your
final
shocking
habit
he
murmured
i
cured
myself
of
that
by
reading
aloud
in
the
bush
go
on
please
you
carry
yourself
so
much
more
stiffly
sometimes
you
have
the
air
of
being
surprised
that
you
are
not
in
trifles
all
these
things
he
declared
now
for
something
serious
the
serious
things
are
pretty
good
she
admitted
you
used
to
drink
whiskys
and
sodas
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
quite
as
much
wine
as
was
good
for
you
at
dinner
time
now
although
you
are
a
wonderful
host
you
scarcely
take
anything
you
should
see
me
at
the
port
he
told
her
when
you
ladies
are
well
out
of
the
way
some
more
of
the
good
please
all
your
best
qualities
seem
to
have
come
to
the
surface
she
went
on
and
i
think
that
the
way
you
have
come
back
and
faced
it
all
is
simply
wonderful
tell
me
if
that
man
body
should
be
discovered
after
all
these
years
would
you
be
charged
with
manslaughter
he
shook
his
head
i
do
not
think
so
well
did
you
kill
roger
unthank
a
portion
of
the
burning
log
fell
on
to
the
hearth
then
there
was
silence
they
heard
the
click
of
the
billiard
balls
in
the
adjoining
room
dominey
leaned
forward
and
with
a
pair
of
small
tongs
replaced
the
burning
wood
upon
the
fire
suddenly
he
felt
his
hands
clasped
by
his
companion
everard
dear
she
said
i
am
so
sorry
you
came
to
me
a
little
tired
did
you
i
think
that
you
needed
sympathy
and
here
i
am
asking
you
once
more
that
horrible
question
forget
it
please
talk
to
me
like
your
old
dear
self
tell
me
about
rosamund
return
is
she
really
recovered
do
you
think
i
saw
her
only
for
a
few
minutes
dominey
replied
but
she
seemed
to
me
absolutely
better
i
must
say
that
the
weekly
reports
i
have
received
from
the
nursing
home
quite
prepared
me
for
a
great
improvement
she
is
very
frail
and
her
eyes
still
have
that
restless
look
but
she
talks
quite
what
about
that
horrible
woman
i
have
pensioned
unthank
to
my
surprise
i
hear
that
she
is
still
living
in
the
and
your
ghost
not
a
single
howl
all
the
time
that
rosamund
has
been
there
is
one
thing
more
caroline
began
hesitatingly
that
one
thing
lacked
forever
the
clothing
of
words
there
came
a
curious
almost
a
dramatic
interruption
through
the
silence
of
the
hall
there
pealed
the
summons
of
the
great
bell
which
hung
over
the
front
door
dominey
glanced
at
the
clock
in
amazement
midnight
he
exclaimed
who
on
earth
can
be
coming
here
at
this
time
of
night
instinctively
they
both
rose
to
their
feet
a
manservant
had
turned
the
great
key
drawn
the
bolts
and
opened
the
door
with
difficulty
little
flakes
of
snow
and
a
gust
of
icy
wind
swept
into
the
hall
and
following
them
the
figure
of
a
man
white
from
head
to
foot
his
hair
tossed
with
the
wind
almost
unrecognisable
after
his
struggle
why
doctor
harrison
dominey
cried
taking
a
quick
step
forward
what
brings
you
here
at
this
time
of
night
the
doctor
leaned
upon
his
stick
for
a
moment
he
was
out
of
breath
and
the
melting
snow
was
pouring
from
his
clothes
on
to
the
oak
floor
they
relieved
him
of
his
coat
and
dragged
him
towards
the
fire
i
must
apologise
for
disturbing
you
at
such
an
hour
he
said
as
he
took
the
tumbler
which
dominey
pressed
into
his
hand
i
have
only
just
received
lady
dominey
telegram
i
had
to
see
you
at
chapter
xviii
the
doctor
with
his
usual
bluntness
did
not
hesitate
to
make
it
known
that
this
unusual
visit
was
of
a
private
nature
caroline
promptly
withdrew
and
the
two
men
were
left
alone
in
the
great
hall
the
lights
in
the
and
were
extinguished
every
one
in
the
house
except
a
few
servants
had
retired
sir
everard
the
doctor
began
this
return
of
lady
dominey
has
taken
me
altogether
by
surprise
i
had
intended
morning
to
discuss
the
situation
with
i
am
most
anxious
to
hear
your
report
dominey
said
my
report
is
good
was
the
confident
answer
although
i
would
not
have
allowed
her
to
have
left
the
nursing
home
so
suddenly
had
i
known
there
was
nothing
to
keep
her
there
lady
dominey
except
for
one
hallucination
is
in
perfect
health
mentally
and
and
this
one
hallucination
that
you
are
not
her
dominey
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
laughed
a
little
unnaturally
can
a
person
be
perfectly
sane
he
asked
and
yet
be
subject
to
an
hallucination
which
must
make
the
whole
of
her
surroundings
seem
unreal
lady
dominey
is
perfectly
sane
the
doctor
answered
bluntly
and
as
for
that
hallucination
it
is
up
to
you
to
dispel
perhaps
you
can
give
me
some
advice
dominey
suggested
i
can
and
i
am
going
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
the
doctor
replied
to
begin
with
then
there
are
certain
obvious
changes
in
you
which
might
well
minister
to
lady
dominey
hallucination
for
instance
you
have
been
in
england
now
some
eight
months
during
which
time
you
have
revealed
an
entirely
new
personality
you
seem
to
have
got
rid
of
every
one
of
your
bad
habits
you
drink
moderately
as
a
gentleman
should
you
have
subdued
your
violent
temper
and
you
have
collected
around
you
where
your
personality
could
be
the
only
inducement
friends
of
distinction
and
interest
this
is
not
at
all
what
one
expected
from
the
everard
dominey
who
scuttled
out
of
england
a
dozen
years
you
are
excusing
my
wife
dominey
remarked
she
needs
no
excuses
was
the
brusque
reply
she
has
been
a
and
faithful
woman
suffering
from
a
cruel
illness
brought
on
to
take
the
kindest
view
if
it
through
your
clumsiness
and
lack
of
discretion
like
all
good
women
forgiveness
is
second
nature
to
her
it
has
now
become
her
wish
to
take
her
proper
place
in
but
if
her
hallucination
continues
dominey
asked
if
she
seriously
doubts
that
i
am
indeed
her
husband
how
can
she
do
that
that
is
the
problem
you
and
i
have
to
face
the
doctor
said
sternly
the
fact
that
your
wife
has
been
willing
to
return
here
to
you
whilst
still
subject
to
that
hallucination
is
a
view
of
the
matter
which
i
can
neither
discuss
nor
understand
i
am
here
though
to
lay
a
charge
upon
you
you
have
to
remember
that
your
wife
needs
still
one
step
towards
a
perfect
recovery
and
until
that
step
has
been
surmounted
you
have
a
very
difficult
but
imperative
dominey
set
his
teeth
for
a
moment
he
felt
the
doctor
keen
grey
eyes
glowing
from
under
his
shaggy
eyebrows
as
he
leaned
forward
his
hands
upon
his
knees
you
mean
dominey
suggested
quietly
that
until
that
hallucination
has
passed
we
must
remain
upon
the
same
terms
as
we
have
done
since
my
arrival
you
got
it
the
doctor
assented
it
a
position
but
we
got
to
deal
with
it
or
rather
you
have
i
can
assure
you
he
went
on
that
all
her
other
delusions
have
gone
she
speaks
of
the
ghost
of
roger
unthank
of
the
cries
in
the
night
of
his
mysterious
death
as
parts
of
a
painful
past
she
is
quite
conscious
of
her
several
attempts
upon
your
life
and
bitterly
regrets
them
now
we
come
to
the
real
danger
she
appears
to
be
possessed
of
a
passionate
devotion
towards
you
whilst
still
believing
that
you
are
not
her
dominey
pushed
his
chair
back
from
the
fire
as
though
he
felt
the
heat
his
eyes
seemed
glued
upon
the
doctor
i
do
not
pretend
the
latter
continued
gravely
to
account
for
that
but
it
is
my
duty
to
warn
you
sir
everard
that
that
devotion
may
lead
her
to
great
lengths
lady
dominey
is
naturally
of
an
exceedingly
affectionate
disposition
and
this
return
to
a
stronger
condition
of
physical
health
and
a
fuller
share
of
human
feelings
has
probably
reawakened
all
those
tendencies
which
her
growing
fondness
for
you
and
your
position
as
her
reputed
husband
make
perfectly
natural
i
warn
you
sir
everard
that
you
may
find
your
position
an
exceedingly
difficult
one
but
difficult
though
it
may
be
there
is
a
plain
duty
before
you
keep
and
encourage
your
wife
affection
if
you
can
but
let
it
be
a
charge
upon
you
that
whilst
the
hallucination
remains
that
affection
must
never
pass
certain
bounds
lady
dominey
is
a
good
and
sweet
woman
if
she
woke
up
one
morning
with
that
hallucination
still
in
her
mind
and
any
sense
of
guilt
on
her
conscience
all
our
labours
for
these
last
months
might
well
be
wasted
and
she
herself
might
very
possibly
end
her
days
in
a
doctor
dominey
said
firmly
i
appreciate
every
word
you
say
you
can
rely
upon
the
doctor
looked
at
him
i
believe
i
can
he
admitted
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
am
glad
of
there
is
just
one
more
phase
of
the
position
dominey
went
on
after
a
pause
supposing
this
hallucination
of
hers
should
pass
supposing
she
should
suddenly
become
convinced
that
i
am
her
husband
in
that
case
the
doctor
replied
earnestly
the
position
would
be
exactly
reversed
and
it
would
be
just
as
important
for
you
not
to
check
the
affection
which
she
might
offer
to
you
as
it
would
be
in
the
other
case
for
you
not
to
accept
it
the
moment
she
realises
with
her
present
predispositions
that
you
really
are
her
lawful
husband
that
moment
will
be
the
beginning
of
a
new
life
for
somehow
they
both
seemed
to
feel
that
the
last
words
had
been
spoken
after
a
brief
pause
the
doctor
helped
himself
to
a
farewell
drink
filled
his
pipe
and
stood
up
the
car
which
dominey
had
ordered
from
the
garage
was
already
standing
at
the
door
it
was
curious
how
both
of
them
seemed
disinclined
to
refer
again
even
indirectly
to
the
subject
which
they
had
been
discussing
very
good
of
you
to
send
me
back
the
doctor
said
gruffly
i
started
out
all
right
but
it
was
a
drear
walk
across
the
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
for
coming
dominey
replied
with
obvious
sincerity
you
will
come
and
have
a
look
at
the
patient
in
a
day
or
two
i
stroll
across
as
soon
as
you
got
rid
of
some
of
this
houseful
the
doctor
promised
good
night
the
two
men
parted
and
curiously
enough
dominey
was
conscious
that
with
those
few
awkward
words
of
farewell
some
part
of
the
incipient
antagonism
between
them
had
been
buried
left
to
himself
he
wandered
for
some
moments
up
and
down
the
great
dimly
lit
hall
a
strange
restlessness
seemed
to
have
fastened
itself
upon
him
he
stood
for
a
time
by
the
dying
fire
watching
the
grey
ashes
stirred
uneasily
by
the
wind
which
howled
down
the
chimney
then
he
strolled
to
a
different
part
of
the
hall
and
one
by
one
he
turned
on
by
means
of
the
electric
switches
the
newly
installed
lights
which
hung
above
the
sombre
oil
pictures
upon
the
wall
he
looked
into
the
faces
of
some
of
these
dead
domineys
trying
to
recall
what
he
had
heard
of
their
history
and
dwelling
longest
upon
a
gallant
of
the
stuart
epoch
whose
misdeeds
had
supplied
material
for
every
intimate
chronicler
of
those
days
when
at
last
the
sight
of
a
sleepy
manservant
hovering
in
the
background
forced
his
steps
upstairs
he
still
lingered
for
a
few
moments
in
the
corridor
and
turned
the
handle
of
his
bedroom
door
with
almost
reluctant
fingers
his
heart
gave
a
great
jump
as
he
realised
that
there
was
some
one
there
he
stood
for
a
moment
upon
the
threshold
then
laughed
shortly
to
himself
at
his
foolish
imagining
it
was
his
servant
who
was
patiently
awaiting
his
arrival
you
can
go
to
bed
dickens
he
directed
i
shall
not
want
you
again
we
shoot
in
the
the
man
silently
took
his
leave
and
dominey
commenced
his
preparations
for
bed
he
was
in
no
humour
for
sleep
however
and
still
attired
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
he
wrapped
a
around
him
drew
a
reading
lamp
to
his
side
and
threw
himself
into
an
a
book
in
his
hand
it
was
some
time
before
he
realised
that
the
volume
was
upside
down
and
even
when
he
had
righted
it
the
words
he
saw
had
no
meaning
for
him
all
the
time
a
queer
procession
of
women
faces
was
passing
before
his
eyes
caroline
with
her
wholly
sentimental
stephanie
with
her
voluptuous
figure
and
eyes
and
then
blotting
the
others
utterly
out
of
his
thoughts
and
memory
rosamund
with
all
the
sweetness
of
life
shining
out
of
her
eager
face
he
saw
her
as
she
had
come
to
him
last
with
that
little
unspoken
cry
upon
her
tremulous
lips
and
the
haunting
appeal
in
her
soft
eyes
all
other
memories
faded
away
they
were
as
though
they
had
never
been
those
dreary
years
of
exile
in
africa
the
day
by
day
tension
of
his
precarious
life
were
absolutely
forgotten
his
heart
was
calling
all
the
time
for
an
unknown
boon
he
felt
himself
immeshed
in
a
world
of
cobwebs
of
weakness
more
potent
than
all
his
boasted
strength
then
he
suddenly
felt
that
the
madness
which
he
had
begun
to
fear
had
really
come
it
was
the
thing
for
which
he
longed
yet
dreaded
most
the
faint
click
the
soft
withdrawal
of
the
panel
actually
pushed
back
by
a
pair
of
white
hands
rosamund
herself
was
there
her
eyes
shone
at
him
mystically
wonderfully
her
lips
were
parted
in
a
delightful
smile
a
smile
in
which
there
was
a
spice
of
girlish
mischief
she
turned
for
a
moment
to
close
the
panel
then
she
came
towards
him
with
her
finger
upraised
i
can
not
sleep
she
said
softly
do
you
mind
my
coming
for
a
few
minutes
of
course
not
he
answered
come
and
sit
she
curled
up
in
his
just
for
a
moment
she
murmured
contentedly
give
me
your
hands
dear
but
how
cold
you
must
come
nearer
to
the
fire
he
sat
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
and
she
stroked
his
head
with
her
hands
you
were
not
afraid
then
she
asked
when
you
saw
me
come
through
the
panel
i
should
never
be
afraid
of
any
harm
that
you
might
bring
me
dear
he
assured
her
because
all
that
foolishness
is
really
gone
she
continued
eagerly
i
know
that
whatever
happened
to
poor
roger
it
was
not
you
who
killed
him
even
if
i
heard
his
ghost
calling
again
i
should
have
no
fear
i
ca
think
why
i
ever
wanted
to
hurt
you
everard
i
am
sure
that
i
always
loved
his
arm
went
very
softly
around
her
she
responded
to
his
embrace
without
hesitation
her
cheek
rested
upon
his
shoulder
he
felt
the
warmth
of
her
arm
through
her
white
why
do
you
doubt
any
longer
then
he
asked
hoarsely
that
i
am
your
husband
she
sighed
ah
but
i
know
you
are
not
she
answered
is
it
wrong
of
me
to
feel
what
i
do
for
you
i
wonder
you
are
so
like
yet
so
unlike
him
he
is
dead
he
died
in
africa
is
it
strange
that
i
should
know
it
but
i
do
but
who
am
i
then
he
whispered
she
looked
at
him
pitifully
i
do
not
know
she
confessed
but
you
are
kind
to
me
and
when
i
feel
you
are
near
i
am
happy
it
is
because
i
wanted
to
see
you
that
i
would
not
stay
any
longer
at
the
nursing
home
that
must
mean
that
i
am
very
fond
of
you
are
not
afraid
he
asked
to
be
here
alone
with
me
she
put
her
other
arm
around
his
neck
and
drew
his
face
down
i
am
not
afraid
she
assured
him
i
am
happy
but
dear
what
is
the
matter
a
moment
ago
you
were
cold
now
your
head
is
wet
your
hands
are
burning
are
you
not
happy
because
i
am
here
her
lips
were
seeking
his
his
own
touched
them
for
a
moment
then
he
kissed
her
on
both
cheeks
she
made
a
little
grimace
i
am
afraid
she
said
that
you
are
not
really
fond
of
ca
you
believe
he
asked
hoarsely
that
i
am
really
everard
your
husband
look
at
me
ca
you
feel
that
you
have
loved
me
before
she
shook
her
head
a
little
sadly
no
you
are
not
everard
she
sighed
but
she
added
her
eyes
lighting
up
you
bring
me
love
and
happiness
and
life
and
a
few
seconds
before
dominey
felt
from
his
soul
that
he
would
have
welcomed
an
earthquake
a
thunderbolt
the
crumbling
of
the
floor
beneath
his
feet
to
have
been
spared
the
torture
of
her
sweet
importunities
yet
nothing
so
horrible
as
this
interruption
which
really
came
could
ever
have
presented
itself
before
his
mind
half
in
his
arms
with
her
head
thrown
back
listening
he
too
horrified
convulsed
for
a
moment
even
with
real
physical
fear
they
heard
the
silence
of
the
night
broken
by
that
one
awful
cry
the
cry
of
a
man
soul
in
torment
imprisoned
in
the
jaws
of
a
beast
they
listened
to
it
together
until
its
echoes
died
away
then
what
was
perhaps
the
most
astonishing
thing
of
all
she
nodded
her
head
slowly
unperturbed
unterrified
you
see
she
said
i
must
go
back
he
will
not
let
me
stay
here
he
must
think
that
you
are
everard
it
is
only
i
who
know
that
you
are
she
slipped
from
the
chair
kissed
him
and
walking
quite
firmly
across
the
floor
touched
the
spring
and
passed
through
the
panel
even
then
she
turned
around
and
waved
a
little
to
him
there
was
no
sign
of
fear
in
her
face
only
a
little
dumb
disappointment
the
panel
glided
to
and
shut
out
the
vision
of
her
dominey
held
his
head
like
a
man
who
fears
madness
chapter
xix
dawn
the
next
morning
was
heralded
by
only
a
thin
line
of
red
parting
the
masses
of
snow
clouds
which
still
hung
low
down
in
the
east
the
wind
had
dropped
and
there
was
something
ghostly
about
the
still
twilight
as
dominey
issued
from
the
back
regions
and
made
his
way
through
the
untrodden
snow
round
to
the
side
of
the
house
underneath
rosamund
window
a
little
exclamation
broke
from
his
lips
as
he
stood
there
from
the
terraced
walks
down
the
steps
and
straight
across
the
park
to
the
corner
of
the
black
wood
were
fresh
tracks
the
cry
had
been
no
fantasy
somebody
or
something
had
passed
from
the
black
wood
and
back
again
to
this
spot
in
the
night
dominey
curiously
excited
by
his
discovery
examined
the
footmarks
eagerly
then
followed
them
to
the
corner
of
the
wood
here
and
there
they
puzzled
him
they
were
neither
like
human
footsteps
nor
the
track
of
any
known
animal
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
they
seemed
to
vanish
into
the
heart
of
a
great
mass
of
brambles
from
which
here
and
there
the
snow
had
been
shaken
off
there
was
no
sign
of
any
pathway
if
ever
there
had
been
one
the
neglect
of
years
had
obliterated
it
bracken
brambles
shrubs
and
bushes
had
grown
up
and
degenerated
only
to
be
succeeded
by
a
ranker
and
more
dense
form
of
undergrowth
many
of
the
trees
although
they
were
still
plentiful
had
been
blown
down
and
left
to
rot
on
the
ground
the
place
was
silent
except
for
the
slow
drip
of
falling
snow
from
the
drooping
leaves
he
took
one
more
cautious
step
forward
and
found
himself
slowly
sinking
black
mud
was
oozing
up
through
the
snow
where
he
had
set
his
feet
he
was
just
able
to
scramble
back
picking
his
way
with
great
caution
he
commenced
a
leisurely
perambulation
of
the
whole
of
the
outside
of
the
wood
heggs
the
junior
keeper
an
hour
or
so
later
went
over
the
gun
rack
once
more
tapped
the
empty
cases
and
turned
towards
middleton
who
was
sitting
in
a
chair
before
the
fire
smoking
his
pipe
i
ca
find
master
number
two
gun
middleton
he
announced
that
look
again
lad
the
old
keeper
directed
removing
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
the
master
was
shooting
with
it
yesterday
look
amongst
those
loose
at
the
far
end
of
the
rack
it
must
be
somewhere
well
that
is
the
young
man
replied
obstinately
the
door
of
the
room
was
suddenly
opened
and
dominey
entered
with
the
missing
gun
under
his
arm
middleton
rose
to
his
feet
at
once
and
laid
down
his
pipe
surprise
kept
him
temporarily
silent
i
want
you
to
come
this
way
with
me
for
a
moment
his
master
ordered
the
keeper
took
up
his
hat
and
stick
and
followed
dominey
led
him
to
where
the
tracks
had
halted
on
the
gravel
outside
rosamund
window
and
pointed
across
to
the
black
wood
what
do
you
make
of
those
he
enquired
middleton
did
not
hesitate
he
shook
his
head
gravely
was
anything
heard
last
night
sir
there
was
an
infernal
yell
underneath
this
that
was
the
spirit
of
roger
unthank
for
sure
middleton
pronounced
with
a
little
shudder
when
he
do
come
out
of
that
wood
he
do
spirits
his
master
pointed
out
do
not
leave
tracks
like
that
middleton
considered
the
matter
they
do
say
hereabout
he
confided
that
the
spirit
of
roger
unthank
have
been
taken
possession
of
by
some
sort
of
great
animal
and
that
it
do
come
here
now
and
then
to
be
by
whom
dominey
enquired
patiently
why
by
mrs
unthank
has
not
been
in
this
house
for
many
months
from
the
day
she
left
until
last
night
so
far
as
i
can
gather
nothing
has
been
heard
of
this
ghost
or
beast
or
whatever
it
that
do
seem
queer
surely
middleton
admitted
dominey
followed
the
tracks
with
his
eyes
to
the
wood
and
back
again
middleton
he
said
i
am
learning
something
about
spirits
it
seems
that
they
not
only
make
tracks
but
they
require
feeding
perhaps
if
that
is
so
they
can
feel
a
charge
of
shot
inside
the
old
man
seemed
for
a
moment
to
stiffen
with
slow
horror
you
would
shoot
at
it
squire
he
gasped
i
should
have
done
so
this
morning
if
i
had
had
a
chance
dominey
replied
when
the
weather
is
a
little
drier
i
am
going
to
make
my
way
into
that
wood
middleton
with
a
rifle
under
my
then
as
god
above
you
never
come
out
squire
was
the
solemn
reply
we
will
see
dominey
muttered
i
have
hacked
my
way
through
some
queer
country
in
there
nowt
like
this
wood
in
the
world
sir
the
old
man
asserted
doggedly
the
bottom
rotten
from
end
to
end
and
the
top
all
poisonous
the
birds
die
there
on
the
trees
it
chockful
of
reptiles
and
unclean
things
with
green
and
purple
fungi
two
feet
high
with
poison
in
the
very
sniff
of
them
the
man
who
enters
that
wood
goes
to
his
nevertheless
dominey
said
firmly
within
a
very
short
time
i
am
going
to
solve
the
mystery
of
this
nocturnal
they
returned
to
the
house
side
by
side
just
before
they
entered
dominey
turned
to
his
companion
middleton
he
said
you
keep
up
the
good
old
customs
i
suppose
and
spend
half
an
hour
at
the
arms
now
and
then
most
every
night
of
my
life
sir
the
old
man
replied
from
eight
till
nine
i
a
man
of
regular
habits
and
that
do
seem
right
to
me
that
with
the
work
done
right
and
proper
a
man
should
have
his
that
is
right
john
dominey
assented
next
time
you
are
there
forget
to
mention
that
i
am
going
to
have
that
wood
looked
through
i
should
like
it
to
get
about
you
understand
that
fair
flummox
the
folk
was
the
doubtful
reply
but
i
let
know
squire
there
be
a
rare
bit
of
talk
i
can
promise
you
dominey
handed
over
his
gun
went
to
his
room
bathed
and
changed
and
descended
for
breakfast
there
was
a
sudden
hush
as
he
entered
which
he
very
well
understood
every
one
began
to
talk
about
the
prospect
of
the
day
sport
dominey
helped
himself
from
the
sideboard
and
took
his
place
at
the
table
i
hope
he
said
that
our
very
latest
thing
in
ghosts
did
not
disturb
we
all
seem
to
have
heard
the
same
thing
the
cabinet
minister
observed
with
interest
a
most
appalling
and
unearthly
cry
i
have
lately
joined
every
society
connected
with
spooks
and
find
them
a
fascinating
if
you
want
to
investigate
dominey
observed
as
he
helped
himself
to
coffee
you
can
bring
out
a
revolver
and
prowl
about
with
me
one
night
from
the
time
when
i
was
a
kid
before
i
went
to
eton
up
till
when
i
left
here
for
africa
we
had
a
series
of
highly
respectable
and
ghosts
who
were
a
credit
to
the
family
and
of
whom
we
were
somewhat
proud
this
latest
spook
however
is
something
quite
outside
the
has
he
a
history
watson
asked
with
interest
i
am
informed
dominey
replied
that
he
is
the
spirit
of
a
schoolmaster
who
once
lived
here
and
for
whose
departure
from
the
world
i
am
supposed
to
be
responsible
such
a
spook
is
neither
a
credit
nor
a
comfort
to
the
their
host
spoke
with
such
an
absolute
absence
of
emotion
that
every
one
was
conscious
of
a
curious
reluctance
to
abandon
a
subject
full
of
such
fascinating
possibilities
terniloff
was
the
only
one
however
who
made
a
suggestion
we
might
have
a
battue
in
the
wood
he
proposed
i
am
not
sure
dominey
told
them
that
the
character
of
the
wood
is
not
more
interesting
than
the
ghost
who
is
supposed
to
dwell
in
it
you
remember
how
terrified
the
beaters
were
yesterday
at
the
bare
suggestion
of
entering
it
for
generations
it
has
been
held
unclean
it
is
certainly
most
unsafe
i
went
in
over
my
knees
on
the
outskirts
of
it
this
morning
shall
we
say
ten
in
the
gun
room
seaman
followed
his
host
out
of
the
room
my
friend
he
said
you
must
not
allow
these
local
circumstances
to
occupy
too
large
a
share
of
your
thoughts
it
is
true
that
these
are
the
days
of
your
relaxation
still
there
is
the
princess
for
you
to
think
of
after
all
she
has
us
in
her
power
the
merest
whisper
in
downing
street
and
behold
catastrophe
dominey
took
his
friend
arm
look
here
seaman
he
rejoined
it
easy
enough
to
say
there
is
the
princess
to
be
considered
but
will
you
kindly
tell
me
what
on
earth
more
i
can
do
to
make
her
see
the
position
necessity
demands
that
i
should
be
on
the
best
of
terms
with
lady
dominey
and
i
should
not
make
myself
in
any
way
conspicuous
with
the
i
am
not
sure
seaman
reflected
that
the
terms
you
are
on
with
lady
dominey
matter
very
much
to
any
one
so
far
as
regards
the
princess
she
is
an
impulsive
and
passionate
person
but
she
is
also
and
a
diplomatist
i
see
no
reason
why
you
should
not
marry
her
secretly
in
london
in
the
name
of
everard
dominey
and
have
the
ceremony
repeated
under
your
rightful
name
later
they
had
paused
to
help
themselves
to
cigarettes
which
were
displayed
with
a
cabinet
of
cigars
on
a
round
table
in
the
hall
dominey
waited
for
a
moment
before
he
answered
has
the
princess
confided
to
you
that
that
is
her
wish
he
asked
something
of
the
sort
seaman
acknowledged
she
wishes
the
suggestion
however
to
come
from
and
your
advice
seaman
blew
out
a
little
cloud
of
cigar
smoke
my
friend
he
confessed
i
am
a
little
afraid
of
the
princess
i
ask
you
no
questions
as
to
your
own
feelings
with
regard
to
her
i
take
it
for
granted
that
as
a
man
of
honour
it
will
be
your
duty
to
offer
her
your
hand
in
marriage
sooner
or
later
i
see
no
harm
in
anticipating
a
few
months
if
by
that
means
we
can
pacify
her
terniloff
would
arrange
it
at
the
embassy
he
is
devoted
to
her
and
it
will
strengthen
your
position
with
dominey
turned
away
towards
the
stairs
we
will
discuss
this
again
before
we
leave
he
said
gloomily
dominey
was
admitted
at
once
by
her
maid
into
his
wife
rosamund
in
a
charming
morning
robe
of
pale
blue
lined
with
grey
fur
had
just
finished
breakfast
she
held
out
her
hands
to
him
with
a
delighted
little
cry
of
welcome
how
nice
of
you
to
come
everard
she
exclaimed
i
was
hoping
i
should
see
you
for
a
moment
before
you
went
he
raised
her
fingers
to
his
lips
and
sat
down
by
her
side
she
seemed
entirely
delighted
by
his
presence
and
he
felt
instinctively
that
she
was
quite
unaffected
by
the
event
of
the
night
before
you
slept
well
he
enquired
perfectly
she
answered
he
tackled
the
subject
bravely
as
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
on
every
opportunity
you
do
not
lie
awake
thinking
of
our
nocturnal
visitor
then
not
for
one
moment
you
see
she
went
on
conversationally
if
you
were
really
everard
then
i
might
be
frightened
for
some
day
or
other
i
feel
that
if
everard
comes
here
the
spirit
of
roger
unthank
will
do
him
some
sort
of
why
he
asked
you
do
know
about
these
things
of
course
she
went
on
but
roger
unthank
was
in
love
with
me
although
i
had
scarcely
ever
spoken
to
him
before
i
married
everard
i
think
i
told
you
that
much
yesterday
i
after
i
was
married
the
poor
man
nearly
went
out
of
his
mind
he
gave
up
his
work
and
used
to
haunt
the
park
here
one
evening
everard
caught
him
and
they
fought
and
roger
unthank
was
never
seen
again
i
think
that
any
one
around
here
would
tell
you
she
went
on
dropping
her
voice
a
little
that
everard
killed
roger
and
threw
him
into
one
of
those
swampy
places
near
the
black
wood
where
a
body
sinks
and
sinks
and
nothing
is
ever
seen
of
it
i
do
not
believe
he
did
anything
of
the
sort
dominey
declared
oh
i
do
know
she
replied
doubtfully
everard
had
a
terrible
temper
and
that
night
he
came
home
covered
with
blood
looking
awful
it
was
the
night
when
i
was
taken
well
no
more
tragedies
he
insisted
i
have
come
up
to
remind
you
that
we
have
guests
here
when
are
you
coming
down
to
see
them
she
laughed
like
a
child
you
say
just
as
though
you
were
really
my
husband
she
declared
you
must
not
tell
any
one
else
of
your
fancy
he
warned
her
she
acquiesced
at
once
oh
i
quite
understand
she
assured
him
i
shall
be
very
very
careful
and
everard
you
have
such
clever
guests
not
at
all
the
sort
of
people
my
everard
would
have
had
here
and
i
have
been
out
of
the
world
for
so
long
that
i
am
afraid
i
be
able
to
talk
to
them
nurse
alice
is
tremendously
impressed
i
am
sure
i
should
be
terrified
to
sit
at
the
end
of
the
table
and
caroline
will
hate
not
being
hostess
any
longer
let
me
come
down
at
and
after
dinner
and
slip
into
things
gradually
you
can
easily
say
that
i
am
still
an
invalid
though
of
course
i
not
at
you
shall
do
exactly
as
you
choose
he
promised
as
he
took
his
leave
so
when
the
shooting
party
tramped
into
the
hall
that
afternoon
a
little
weary
but
flushed
with
exercise
and
the
pleasure
of
the
sport
they
found
seated
in
a
corner
of
the
room
behind
the
great
round
table
upon
which
tea
was
set
out
a
rather
pale
but
extraordinarily
childlike
and
fascinating
woman
with
large
sweet
eyes
which
seemed
to
be
begging
for
their
protection
and
sympathy
as
she
rose
hesitatingly
to
her
feet
dominey
was
by
her
side
in
a
moment
and
his
first
few
words
of
introduction
brought
every
one
around
her
she
said
very
little
but
what
she
said
was
delightfully
natural
and
gracious
it
has
been
so
kind
of
you
she
said
to
caroline
to
help
my
husband
entertain
his
guests
i
am
very
much
better
but
i
have
been
ill
for
so
long
that
i
have
forgotten
a
great
many
things
and
i
should
be
a
very
poor
hostess
but
i
want
to
make
tea
for
you
please
and
i
want
you
all
to
tell
me
how
many
pheasants
you
have
terniloff
seated
himself
on
the
settee
by
her
side
i
am
going
to
help
you
in
this
complicated
task
he
declared
i
am
sure
those
sugar
tongs
are
too
heavy
for
you
to
wield
she
laughed
at
him
gaily
but
i
am
not
really
delicate
at
all
she
assured
him
i
have
had
a
very
bad
illness
but
i
am
quite
strong
then
i
will
find
some
other
excuse
for
sitting
here
he
said
i
will
tell
you
all
about
the
high
pheasants
your
husband
killed
and
about
the
woodcock
he
brought
down
after
we
had
all
missed
i
shall
love
to
hear
about
that
she
assented
how
much
sugar
please
and
will
you
pass
those
hot
muffins
to
the
princess
and
please
touch
that
bell
i
shall
want
more
hot
water
i
expect
you
are
all
very
thirsty
i
am
so
glad
to
be
here
with
chapter
xx
arm
in
arm
prince
terniloff
and
his
host
climbed
the
slope
at
the
back
of
a
long
fir
plantation
towards
the
little
beflagged
sticks
which
indicated
their
stand
there
was
not
a
human
being
in
sight
for
the
rest
of
the
guns
had
chosen
a
steeper
but
somewhat
less
circuitous
route
von
ragastein
the
ambassador
said
i
am
going
to
give
myself
the
luxury
of
calling
you
by
your
name
you
know
my
one
weakness
a
weakness
which
in
my
younger
days
very
nearly
drove
me
out
of
diplomacy
i
detest
espionage
in
every
shape
and
form
even
where
it
is
necessary
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
my
young
friend
he
went
on
i
think
your
position
ridiculous
i
have
sent
a
private
despatch
to
potsdam
in
which
i
have
expressed
that
so
far
dominey
remarked
i
have
not
been
my
dear
young
friend
the
prince
continued
you
have
not
been
overworked
because
there
has
been
no
legitimate
work
for
you
to
do
there
will
be
none
there
could
be
no
possible
advantage
accruing
from
your
labours
here
to
compensate
for
the
very
bad
effect
which
the
discovery
of
your
true
name
and
position
would
have
in
the
english
i
must
ask
you
to
remember
dominey
begged
that
i
am
here
as
a
blind
servant
of
the
fatherland
i
simply
obey
i
will
grant
that
freely
the
prince
consented
but
to
continue
i
am
now
at
the
end
of
my
first
year
in
this
country
i
feel
able
to
congratulate
myself
upon
a
certain
measure
of
success
from
that
part
of
the
cabinet
with
whom
i
have
had
to
do
i
have
received
nothing
but
encouragement
in
my
efforts
to
promote
a
better
understanding
between
our
two
the
sky
certainly
seems
clear
enough
just
now
agreed
dominey
i
have
convinced
myself
the
prince
said
emphatically
that
there
is
a
genuine
and
solid
desire
for
peace
with
germany
existing
in
downing
street
in
every
argument
i
have
had
in
every
concession
i
have
asked
for
i
have
been
met
with
a
sincere
desire
to
foster
the
growing
friendship
between
our
countries
i
am
proud
of
my
work
here
von
ragastein
i
believe
that
i
have
brought
germany
and
england
nearer
together
than
they
have
been
since
the
days
of
the
boer
you
are
sure
sir
dominey
asked
that
you
are
not
confusing
personal
popularity
with
national
sentiment
i
am
sure
of
it
the
ambassador
answered
gravely
such
popularity
as
i
may
have
achieved
here
has
been
due
to
an
appreciation
of
the
more
healthy
state
of
world
politics
now
existing
it
has
been
my
great
pleasure
to
trace
the
result
of
my
work
in
a
manuscript
of
memoirs
which
some
day
when
peace
is
firmly
established
between
our
two
countries
i
shall
cause
to
be
published
i
have
put
on
record
there
evidences
of
the
really
genuine
sentiment
in
favour
of
peace
which
i
have
found
amongst
the
present
i
should
esteem
it
an
immense
privilege
dominey
said
to
be
given
a
private
reading
of
these
that
may
be
arranged
was
the
suave
reply
in
the
meantime
von
ragastein
i
want
you
to
reconsider
your
position
my
position
is
not
voluntary
dominey
repeated
i
am
acting
under
precisely
the
other
acquiesced
but
matters
have
changed
very
much
during
the
last
six
months
even
at
the
risk
of
offending
france
england
is
showing
wonderful
pliability
with
regard
to
our
claims
in
morocco
every
prospect
of
disagreement
between
our
two
countries
upon
any
vital
matter
has
now
unless
dominey
said
thoughtfully
the
desire
for
war
should
come
not
from
downing
street
but
from
we
serve
an
honourable
master
terniloff
declared
sternly
and
he
has
shown
me
his
mind
his
will
is
for
peace
and
for
the
great
triumphs
to
which
our
country
is
already
entitled
by
reason
of
her
supremacy
in
industry
in
commerce
in
character
and
in
genius
these
are
the
weapons
which
will
make
germany
the
greatest
power
in
the
world
no
empire
has
ever
hewn
its
way
to
permanent
glory
by
the
sword
alone
we
have
reached
our
stations
i
see
come
to
me
after
this
drive
is
finished
my
host
all
that
i
have
said
so
far
has
been
by
way
of
the
weather
had
turned
drier
the
snow
was
crisp
and
a
little
party
of
women
from
the
hall
reached
the
guns
before
the
beaters
were
through
the
wood
caroline
and
stephanie
both
took
their
places
by
dominey
side
the
former
however
after
a
few
minutes
passed
on
to
terniloff
stand
stephanie
and
dominey
were
alone
for
the
first
time
since
their
stormy
interview
in
the
library
has
maurice
been
talking
to
you
she
asked
a
little
abruptly
his
excellency
and
i
are
to
tell
you
the
truth
dominey
confessed
in
the
midst
of
a
most
interesting
has
he
spoken
to
you
about
me
your
name
has
not
yet
been
she
made
a
little
grimace
in
her
wonderful
furs
and
russian
turban
hat
she
made
a
rather
striking
picture
against
the
background
of
snow
an
interesting
conversation
in
which
my
name
has
not
been
mentioned
she
repeated
satirically
i
think
you
were
coming
into
it
before
very
long
dominey
assured
her
his
excellency
warned
me
that
all
he
had
said
so
far
was
merely
the
prelude
to
a
matter
of
larger
stephanie
smiled
dear
maurice
is
so
diplomatic
she
murmured
i
am
perfectly
certain
he
is
going
to
begin
by
remonstrating
you
for
your
shocking
treatment
of
their
conversation
was
interrupted
for
a
few
minutes
by
the
sport
dominey
called
the
faithful
middleton
to
his
side
for
a
further
supply
of
cartridges
stephanie
bided
her
time
which
came
when
the
beaters
at
last
emerged
from
the
wood
shocking
stephanie
repeated
reverting
to
their
conversation
is
the
mildest
word
in
my
vocabulary
which
i
can
apply
to
your
treatment
of
me
honestly
leopold
i
feel
bruised
all
over
inside
my
pride
is
it
is
because
you
look
at
the
matter
only
from
a
feminine
point
of
view
dominey
persisted
and
you
she
answered
in
a
low
tone
once
the
fondest
and
the
most
passionate
of
lovers
only
from
a
political
one
you
think
a
great
deal
of
your
country
leopold
have
i
no
claims
upon
you
upon
everard
dominey
none
he
insisted
when
the
time
comes
and
leopold
von
ragastein
can
claim
all
that
is
his
right
believe
me
you
will
have
no
cause
to
complain
of
coldness
or
dilatoriness
he
will
have
only
one
thought
only
one
hope
to
end
the
torture
of
these
years
of
separation
as
speedily
as
may
the
strained
look
passed
from
her
face
her
tone
became
more
natural
but
dear
she
pleaded
there
is
no
need
to
wait
your
sovereign
gives
you
permission
your
political
chief
will
more
than
endorse
i
am
on
the
spot
dominey
replied
and
believe
me
i
know
what
is
safest
and
best
i
can
not
live
as
two
men
and
keep
my
face
steadfast
to
the
world
the
prince
however
has
not
spoken
to
me
yet
i
will
hear
what
he
has
to
stephanie
turned
a
little
haughtily
away
you
are
putting
me
in
the
position
of
a
supplicant
she
exclaimed
we
must
have
an
the
little
party
moved
on
all
together
to
another
cover
rosamund
had
joined
them
and
hung
on
to
dominey
arm
with
delight
the
brisk
walk
across
the
park
had
brought
colour
to
her
cheeks
she
walked
with
all
the
free
and
vigorous
grace
of
a
healthy
woman
dominey
found
himself
watching
her
as
she
deserted
him
a
little
later
on
to
stand
by
terniloff
side
with
a
little
thrill
of
tangled
emotions
he
felt
a
touch
on
his
arm
stephanie
who
was
passing
with
another
of
the
guns
paused
to
whisper
in
his
ear
there
might
be
a
greater
danger
one
that
has
evaded
even
your
cautious
mind
in
overplaying
your
part
dominey
was
taken
possession
of
by
caroline
on
their
walk
to
the
next
stand
she
planted
herself
on
a
shooting
stick
by
his
side
and
commenced
to
take
him
roundly
to
task
my
dear
everard
she
said
you
are
one
of
the
most
wonderful
examples
of
the
reformed
rake
i
ever
met
you
have
even
acquired
respectability
for
heaven
sake
do
disappoint
us
all
i
seem
to
be
rather
good
at
that
dominey
observed
a
little
drearily
well
you
are
the
master
of
your
own
actions
are
you
not
she
asked
what
i
want
to
say
in
plain
words
is
do
go
and
make
a
fool
of
yourself
with
i
have
not
the
least
intention
of
doing
anything
of
the
well
she
has
mark
my
words
everard
i
know
that
woman
she
is
clever
and
brilliant
and
anything
else
you
like
but
for
some
reason
or
other
she
has
set
her
mind
upon
you
she
looks
at
dear
little
rosamund
as
though
she
had
a
right
to
exist
do
look
so
sorry
for
yourself
you
must
have
encouraged
dominey
was
silent
fortunately
the
exigencies
of
the
next
few
minutes
demanded
it
his
cousin
waited
patiently
until
there
came
a
pause
in
the
shooting
now
let
me
hear
what
you
have
to
say
for
yourself
sir
so
far
as
i
can
see
you
been
quite
sweet
to
your
wife
and
she
adores
you
if
you
want
to
have
an
affair
with
the
princess
do
begin
it
here
have
your
wife
ill
again
if
you
make
her
my
dear
caroline
there
will
be
no
affair
between
stephanie
and
me
of
that
you
may
rest
you
mean
to
say
that
this
is
altogether
on
her
side
then
caroline
persisted
you
exaggerate
her
demeanour
he
replied
but
even
if
what
you
suggest
were
true
oh
i
do
want
a
lot
of
protestations
she
interrupted
i
am
not
saying
that
you
encourage
her
much
because
i
do
believe
you
do
all
i
want
to
point
out
is
that
having
really
brought
your
wife
back
almost
to
health
you
must
be
extraordinarily
and
wonderfully
careful
if
you
want
to
talk
nonsense
with
stephanie
do
it
in
belgrave
dominey
was
watching
the
gyrations
of
a
falling
pheasant
his
left
hand
was
stretched
out
towards
the
cartridge
bag
which
caroline
was
holding
he
clasped
her
fingers
for
a
moment
before
he
helped
himself
you
are
rather
a
dear
he
said
i
would
not
do
anything
to
hurt
rosamund
for
the
if
you
ca
get
rid
of
your
old
tricks
altogether
and
must
flirt
she
remarked
well
i
always
somewhere
about
rosamund
would
mind
me
because
there
are
a
few
grey
hairs
in
my
sandy
and
here
comes
your
man
across
the
park
looks
as
though
he
had
a
message
for
you
so
long
as
nothing
has
happened
to
your
cook
i
feel
that
i
could
face
ill
tidings
with
dominey
found
himself
watching
with
fixed
eyes
the
approach
of
his
rather
manservant
through
the
snow
parkins
was
not
dressed
for
such
an
enterprise
nor
did
he
seem
in
any
way
to
relish
it
his
was
the
stern
march
of
duty
and
curiously
enough
dominey
felt
from
the
moment
he
caught
sight
of
him
that
he
was
in
some
respects
a
messenger
of
fate
yet
the
message
which
he
delivered
when
at
last
he
reached
his
master
side
was
in
no
way
alarming
a
person
of
the
name
of
miller
has
arrived
here
sir
he
announced
from
norwich
he
is
i
understand
a
foreigner
of
some
sort
who
has
recently
landed
in
this
country
i
found
it
a
little
difficult
to
understand
him
but
her
highness
maid
conversed
with
him
in
german
and
i
understand
that
he
either
is
or
brings
you
a
message
from
a
certain
doctor
schmidt
with
whom
you
were
acquainted
in
the
warning
whistle
blew
at
that
moment
and
dominey
swung
round
and
stood
at
attention
his
behaviour
was
perfectly
normal
he
let
a
hen
pheasant
pass
over
his
head
and
brought
down
a
cock
from
very
nearly
the
limit
distance
he
reloaded
before
he
turned
to
parkins
is
this
person
in
a
hurry
he
said
by
no
means
sir
the
man
replied
i
told
him
that
you
would
not
be
back
until
three
or
four
and
he
is
quite
content
to
dominey
nodded
look
after
him
yourself
then
parkins
he
directed
we
shall
not
be
shooting
late
very
likely
i
will
send
mr
seaman
back
to
talk
to
the
man
raised
his
hat
respectfully
and
turned
back
towards
the
house
caroline
was
watching
her
companion
curiously
do
you
find
many
of
your
acquaintances
in
africa
look
you
up
everard
she
asked
except
for
seaman
dominey
replied
looking
through
the
barrels
of
his
gun
who
really
does
not
count
because
we
crossed
together
this
is
my
first
visitor
from
the
land
of
fortune
i
expect
there
will
be
plenty
of
them
by
and
by
though
colonials
have
a
wonderful
habit
of
sticking
to
one
chapter
xxi
there
was
nothing
in
the
least
alarming
about
the
appearance
of
ludwig
miller
he
had
been
exceedingly
well
entertained
in
the
private
and
had
the
air
of
having
done
full
justice
to
the
hospitality
which
had
been
offered
him
he
rose
to
his
feet
at
entrance
and
stood
at
attention
but
for
some
slight
indications
of
military
training
he
would
have
passed
anywhere
as
a
highly
respectable
retired
tradesman
sir
everard
dominey
he
enquired
dominey
nodded
assent
that
is
my
name
have
i
seen
you
before
the
man
shook
his
head
i
am
a
cousin
of
doctor
schmidt
i
arrived
in
the
colony
from
rhodesia
after
your
excellency
had
and
how
is
the
doctor
my
cousin
is
as
always
busy
but
in
excellent
health
was
the
reply
he
sends
his
respectful
compliments
and
his
good
wishes
also
this
with
a
little
flourish
the
man
produced
an
envelope
inscribed
to
sir
everard
dominey
baronet
dominey
hall
in
the
county
of
norfolk
england
dominey
broke
the
seal
just
as
seaman
entered
a
messenger
here
from
doctor
schmidt
an
acquaintance
of
mine
in
east
africa
he
announced
mr
seaman
came
home
from
south
africa
with
me
he
explained
to
his
visitor
the
two
men
looked
steadily
into
each
other
eyes
dominey
watched
them
fascinated
neither
betrayed
himself
by
even
the
fall
of
an
eyelid
yet
dominey
his
perceptive
powers
at
their
very
keenest
in
this
moment
which
instinct
told
him
was
one
of
crisis
felt
the
unspoken
unbetokened
recognition
which
passed
between
them
some
commonplace
remark
was
uttered
and
responded
to
dominey
read
the
few
lines
which
seemed
to
take
him
back
for
a
moment
to
another
world
honoured
and
honourable
sir
i
send
you
my
heartiest
and
most
respectful
greeting
of
the
progress
of
all
matters
here
you
will
learn
from
another
source
i
recommend
to
your
notice
and
kindness
my
cousin
the
bearer
of
this
letter
ludwig
miller
he
will
lay
before
you
certain
circumstances
of
which
it
is
advisable
for
you
to
have
knowledge
you
may
speak
freely
with
him
he
is
in
all
respects
to
be
trusted
karl
signed
your
cousin
is
a
little
mysterious
dominey
remarked
as
he
passed
the
letter
to
seaman
come
what
about
these
circumstances
ludwig
miller
looked
around
the
little
room
and
then
at
seaman
dominey
affected
to
misunderstand
his
hesitation
our
friend
here
knows
everything
he
declared
you
can
speak
to
him
as
to
the
man
began
as
one
who
has
a
story
to
tell
my
errand
here
is
to
warn
you
he
said
that
the
englishman
whom
you
left
for
dead
at
big
bend
on
the
banks
of
the
blue
river
has
been
heard
of
in
another
part
of
dominey
shook
his
head
incredulously
i
hope
you
have
not
come
all
this
way
to
tell
me
that
the
man
was
my
cousin
himself
miller
continued
was
hard
to
convince
the
man
left
his
encampment
with
whisky
enough
to
kill
him
thirst
enough
to
drink
it
all
and
no
so
i
found
him
dominey
assented
deserted
by
his
boys
and
raving
to
silence
him
forever
was
a
child
the
task
however
was
unperformed
the
other
persisted
from
three
places
in
the
colony
he
has
been
heard
of
struggling
to
make
his
way
to
the
does
he
call
himself
by
his
own
name
dominey
asked
he
does
not
miller
admitted
my
cousin
however
desired
me
to
point
out
to
you
the
fact
that
in
any
case
he
would
probably
be
shy
of
doing
so
he
is
behaving
in
an
absurd
manner
he
is
in
a
very
weakly
state
and
without
a
doubt
he
is
to
some
degree
insane
nevertheless
the
fact
remains
that
he
is
in
the
colony
or
was
three
months
ago
and
that
if
he
succeeds
in
reaching
the
coast
you
may
at
any
time
be
surprised
by
a
visit
from
him
here
i
am
sent
to
warn
you
in
order
that
you
may
take
whatever
steps
may
be
necessary
and
not
be
placed
at
a
disadvantage
if
he
should
this
is
queer
news
you
have
brought
us
miller
seaman
said
thoughtfully
it
is
news
which
greatly
disturbed
doctor
schmidt
the
man
replied
he
has
had
the
natives
up
one
after
another
for
nothing
can
shake
their
if
we
believed
it
seaman
continued
this
other
european
if
he
had
business
in
this
direction
might
walk
in
here
at
any
it
was
to
warn
you
of
that
possibility
that
i
am
how
much
do
you
know
personally
seaman
asked
of
the
existent
circumstances
the
man
shook
his
head
vaguely
i
know
nothing
he
admitted
i
went
out
to
east
africa
some
years
ago
and
i
have
been
a
trader
in
mozambique
in
a
small
way
i
supplied
outfits
for
officers
and
hospitals
and
sportsmen
now
and
then
i
have
to
return
to
europe
to
buy
fresh
stock
doctor
schmidt
knew
that
and
he
came
to
see
me
just
before
i
sailed
he
first
thought
of
writing
a
very
long
letter
afterwards
he
changed
his
mind
he
wrote
only
these
few
lines
i
brought
but
he
told
me
those
other
you
have
remembered
all
that
he
told
you
dominey
asked
i
can
think
of
nothing
else
was
the
reply
after
a
moment
pause
the
whole
affair
has
been
a
great
worry
to
doctor
schmidt
there
are
things
connected
with
it
which
he
has
never
understood
things
connected
with
it
which
he
has
always
found
hence
your
presence
here
johann
wolff
seaman
asked
in
an
altered
tone
the
visitor
expression
remained
unchanged
except
for
the
faint
surprise
which
shone
out
of
his
blue
eyes
johann
wolff
he
repeated
that
is
not
my
name
i
am
ludwig
miller
and
i
know
nothing
of
this
matter
beyond
what
i
have
told
you
i
am
just
a
once
in
vienna
and
twice
in
cracow
my
friend
we
have
met
seaman
reminded
him
softly
but
very
insistently
the
other
shook
his
head
gently
a
mistake
i
have
been
in
vienna
once
many
years
ago
but
cracow
you
have
no
idea
with
whom
you
are
talking
herr
seaman
was
the
name
i
it
is
a
very
good
name
seaman
scoffed
look
here
and
he
undid
his
coat
and
waistcoat
and
displayed
a
plain
vest
of
chamois
leather
attached
to
the
side
of
it
was
a
bronze
decoration
with
lettering
and
a
number

stared
at
it
blankly
and
shook

head

seaman
continued
dropping
his
voice
his
listener
shook
his
head
and
smiled
with
the
puzzled
ignorance
of
a
child
the
gentleman
mistakes
me
for
some
one
else
he
replied
i
know
nothing
of
these
seaman
sat
and
studied
this
obstinate
visitor
for
several
minutes
without
speaking
his
finger
tips
pressed
together
his
eyebrows
gently
contracted
his
endured
this
scrutiny
without
flinching
calm
phlegmatic
the
very
prototype
of
the
bourgeois
german
of
the
tradesman
class
do
you
propose
dominey
enquired
to
stay
in
these
parts
long
one
or
two
days
a
week
perhaps
was
the
indifferent
answer
i
have
a
cousin
in
norwich
who
makes
toys
i
love
the
english
country
i
spend
my
holiday
here
just
so
seaman
muttered
grimly
the
english
country
under
a
foot
of
snow
so
you
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
me
johann
wolff
i
have
executed
my
mission
to
his
excellency
was
the
apologetic
reply
i
am
sorry
to
have
caused
displeasure
to
you
herr
the
latter
rose
to
his
feet
dominey
had
already
turned
towards
the
door
you
will
spend
the
night
here
of
course
miller
he
invited
i
dare
say
mr
seaman
would
like
to
have
another
talk
with
you
in
the
i
shall
gladly
spend
the
night
here
your
excellency
was
the
polite
reply
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
anything
to
say
however
which
would
interest
your
you
are
making
a
great
mistake
wolff
seaman
declared
angrily
i
am
your
superior
in
the
service
and
your
attitude
towards
me
is
if
the
gentleman
would
only
believe
the
culprit
begged
that
he
is
mistaking
me
for
some
one
else
there
was
trouble
in
seaman
face
as
the
two
men
made
their
way
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
trouble
in
his
tone
as
he
answered
his
companion
query
what
do
you
think
of
that
fellow
and
his
visit
i
do
not
know
what
to
think
but
there
is
a
great
deal
that
i
know
seaman
replied
gravely
the
man
is
a
spy
a
favourite
in
the
wilhelmstrasse
and
only
made
use
of
on
important
occasions
his
name
is
wolff
johann
and
this
story
of
his
you
ought
to
be
the
best
judge
of
i
am
dominey
assented
confidently
without
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
i
threw
the
body
of
the
man
i
killed
into
the
blue
river
and
watched
it
then
the
story
is
a
fake
seaman
decided
for
some
reason
or
other
we
have
come
under
the
suspicion
of
our
own
secret
seaman
as
they
emerged
into
the
hall
was
summoned
imperiously
to
her
side
by
the
princess
eiderstrom
dominey
disappeared
for
a
moment
and
returned
presently
having
discarded
some
of
his
soaked
shooting
garments
he
was
followed
by
his
valet
bearing
a
note
upon
a
silver
tray
from
the
person
in
parkins
room
to
mr
seaman
sir
the
man
announced
in
a
low
tone
dominey
took
it
from
the
salver
with
a
little
nod
then
he
turned
to
where
the
youngest
and
most
frivolous
of
his
guests
were
in
the
act
of
rising
from
the
tea
table
a
game
of
pills
eddy
he
proposed
they
tell
me
that
pool
is
one
of
your
greatest
i
pretty
useful
the
young
man
confessed
with
a
satisfied
chuckle
give
you
a
black
at
snooker
what
dominey
took
his
arm
and
led
him
into
the
you
will
give
me
nothing
young
fellow
he
replied
set
them
up
and
i
will
show
you
how
i
made
a
living
for
two
months
at
johannesberg
chapter
xxii
the
evening
at
dominey
hall
was
practically
a
repetition
of
the
previous
one
with
a
different
set
of
guests
from
the
outer
world
after
dinner
dominey
was
absent
for
a
few
minutes
and
returned
with
rosamund
upon
his
arm
she
received
the
congratulations
of
her
neighbours
charmingly
and
a
little
court
soon
gathered
around
her
doctor
harrison
who
had
been
dining
remained
upon
the
outskirts
listening
to
her
and
at
times
almost
brilliant
chatter
with
grave
and
watchful
interest
dominey
satisfied
that
she
was
being
entertained
obeyed
gestured
behest
and
strolled
with
him
to
a
distant
corner
of
the
hall
let
me
now
my
dear
host
the
prince
began
with
some
eagerness
in
his
tone
continue
and
i
trust
conclude
the
conversation
to
which
all
that
i
said
this
morning
was
merely
the
i
am
entirely
at
your
service
murmured
his
host
i
have
tried
to
make
you
understand
that
from
my
own
point
of
view
and
i
am
in
a
position
to
know
something
the
fear
of
war
between
this
country
and
our
own
has
passed
england
is
willing
to
make
all
reasonable
sacrifices
to
ensure
peace
she
wants
peace
she
intends
peace
therefore
there
will
be
peace
therefore
i
maintain
my
young
friend
it
is
far
better
for
you
to
disappear
at
once
from
this
false
i
am
scarcely
my
own
master
dominey
replied
you
yourself
must
know
that
i
am
here
as
a
servant
under
join
your
protests
with
mine
the
prince
suggested
i
will
make
a
report
directly
i
get
back
to
london
to
my
mind
the
matter
is
urgent
if
anything
should
lead
to
the
discovery
of
your
false
position
in
this
country
the
friendship
between
us
which
has
become
a
real
pleasure
to
me
must
seriously
undermine
my
own
dominey
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
was
standing
on
the
hearthrug
in
front
of
a
fire
of
blazing
logs
the
ambassador
was
sitting
with
crossed
legs
in
a
comfortable
smoking
one
of
the
long
thin
cigars
which
were
his
particular
fancy
your
excellency
dominey
said
there
is
just
one
fallacy
in
all
that
you
have
a
fallacy
you
have
come
to
the
absolute
conclusion
dominey
continued
that
because
england
wants
peace
there
will
be
peace
i
am
of
seaman
mind
i
believe
in
the
ultimate
power
of
the
military
party
of
germany
i
believe
that
in
time
they
will
thrust
their
will
upon
the
kaiser
if
he
is
not
at
the
present
moment
secretly
in
league
with
them
therefore
i
believe
that
there
will
be
if
i
shared
that
belief
with
you
my
friend
the
ambassador
said
quietly
i
should
consider
my
position
here
one
of
dishonour
my
mandate
is
for
peace
and
my
charge
is
from
the
kaiser
stephanie
with
the
air
of
one
a
little
weary
of
the
conversation
broke
away
from
a
distant
group
and
came
towards
them
her
beautiful
eyes
seemed
tired
she
moved
listlessly
and
she
even
spoke
with
less
than
her
usual
assurance
am
i
disturbing
a
serious
conversation
she
asked
send
me
away
if
i
his
excellency
and
i
dominey
observed
have
reached
a
in
our
argument
the
blank
wall
of
but
fundamental
then
i
shall
claim
you
for
a
while
stephanie
declared
taking
dominey
arm
lady
dominey
has
attracted
all
the
men
to
her
circle
and
i
am
the
prince
bowed
i
deny
the
he
said
but
i
yield
our
host
i
shall
seek
my
opponent
at
he
turned
away
and
stephanie
sank
into
his
vacant
place
so
you
and
my
cousin
she
remarked
as
she
made
room
for
dominey
to
sit
by
her
side
have
come
to
a
not
an
unfriendly
one
her
host
assured
her
that
i
am
sure
of
maurice
seems
indeed
to
have
taken
a
wonderful
liking
to
you
i
can
not
remember
that
you
ever
met
before
except
for
that
day
or
two
in
saxony
that
is
so
the
first
time
i
exchanged
any
intimate
conversation
with
the
prince
was
in
london
i
have
the
utmost
respect
and
regard
for
him
but
i
can
not
help
feeling
that
the
pleasant
intimacy
to
which
he
has
admitted
me
is
to
a
large
extent
owing
to
the
desire
of
our
friends
in
berlin
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
have
never
met
any
one
of
any
nation
whose
character
i
admire
maurice
lives
his
life
loftily
he
is
one
of
the
few
great
aristocrats
i
have
met
who
carries
his
nobility
of
birth
into
his
simplest
thought
and
action
there
is
just
one
thing
she
added
which
would
break
his
and
that
the
subject
upon
which
you
two
disagree
a
war
between
germany
and
this
the
prince
is
an
idealist
dominey
said
sometimes
i
wonder
why
he
was
sent
here
why
they
did
not
send
some
one
of
a
more
intriguing
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
you
agree
with
that
great
frenchman
she
observed
that
no
ambassador
can
remain
a
gentleman
well
i
have
never
been
a
diplomat
so
i
can
not
say
dominey
replied
you
have
many
qualifications
i
should
think
she
observed
cuttingly
such
as
you
are
absolutely
callous
absolutely
without
heart
or
sympathy
where
your
work
is
i
do
not
admit
it
he
protested
i
go
back
to
london
she
continued
a
very
miserable
and
unhappy
woman
i
take
with
me
the
letter
which
should
have
brought
me
happiness
the
love
for
which
i
have
sacrificed
my
life
has
failed
me
not
even
the
whip
of
a
royal
command
not
even
all
that
i
have
to
offer
can
give
me
even
five
seconds
of
all
that
i
have
pleaded
for
dominey
reminded
her
earnestly
is
and
what
delay
do
you
think
she
asked
with
a
sudden
note
of
passion
in
her
tone
would
the
leopold
von
ragastein
of
six
years
ago
have
pleaded
for
delay
he
found
words
then
which
would
have
melted
an
iceberg
he
found
words
the
memory
of
which
comes
to
me
sometimes
in
the
night
and
which
mock
me
he
had
no
country
then
save
the
paradise
where
lovers
walk
no
ruler
but
a
queen
and
i
was
she
and
now
dominey
felt
a
strange
pang
of
distress
she
saw
the
unusual
softening
in
his
face
and
her
eyes
lit
up
just
for
a
moment
she
broke
off
you
were
like
leopold
as
a
rule
you
know
you
are
not
like
him
i
think
that
you
left
him
somewhere
in
africa
and
came
home
in
his
believe
that
for
a
little
time
dominey
begged
earnestly
what
if
it
were
true
she
asked
abruptly
there
are
times
when
i
do
not
recognise
you
there
are
words
leopold
used
to
use
which
i
have
never
heard
from
your
lips
is
not
west
africa
the
sorcerer
paradise
perhaps
you
are
an
imposter
and
the
man
i
love
is
there
still
in
trouble
perhaps
you
play
the
part
of
everard
dominey
like
a
very
king
of
actors
perhaps
before
you
came
here
you
played
the
part
of
leopold
you
are
not
my
leopold
love
can
not
die
as
you
would
have
me
now
he
said
coolly
you
are
coming
round
to
my
way
of
thinking
i
have
been
assuring
you
from
the
very
first
moment
we
met
at
the
carlton
that
i
was
not
your
leopold
that
i
was
everard
i
shall
put
you
to
the
test
she
exclaimed
suddenly
rising
to
her
feet
your
arm
if
you
she
led
him
across
the
hall
to
where
little
groups
of
people
were
gossiping
playing
bridge
and
seaman
the
center
of
a
little
group
of
gullible
amateur
speculators
was
lecturing
on
mines
they
stopped
to
say
a
word
or
two
here
and
there
but
stephanie
fingers
never
left
her
companion
arm
they
passed
down
a
corridor
hung
with
a
collection
of
wonderful
sporting
prints
in
which
she
affected
some
interest
into
a
small
gallery
which
led
into
the
ballroom
here
they
were
alone
she
laid
her
hands
upon
his
shoulders
and
looked
up
into
his
eyes
her
lips
drew
nearer
to
his
kiss
me
upon
the
lips
leopold
she
ordered
there
is
no
leopold
here
he
replied
you
yourself
have
said
she
came
a
little
nearer
upon
the
lips
she
whispered
he
held
her
stooped
down
and
their
lips
met
then
she
stood
apart
from
him
her
eyes
were
for
a
moment
closed
her
hands
were
extended
as
though
to
prevent
any
chance
of
his
approaching
her
again
now
i
know
the
truth
she
muttered
dominey
found
an
opportunity
to
draw
seaman
away
from
his
little
group
of
friends
my
friend
he
said
trouble
anything
more
from
schmidt
supposed
emissary
seaman
asked
quickly
no
i
am
going
to
keep
away
from
him
this
evening
and
i
advise
you
to
do
the
same
the
trouble
is
with
the
with
the
princess
declared
seaman
i
think
you
have
blundered
i
quite
appreciate
your
general
principles
of
behaving
internally
and
externally
as
though
you
were
the
person
whom
you
pretend
to
be
it
is
the
very
essence
of
all
successful
espionage
but
you
should
know
when
to
make
exceptions
i
see
grave
objections
myself
to
your
obeying
the
kaiser
behest
on
the
other
hand
i
see
no
objection
whatever
to
your
treating
the
princess
in
a
more
human
manner
to
your
visiting
her
in
london
and
giving
her
more
ardent
proofs
of
your
continued
if
i
once
begin
look
here
seaman
interrupted
the
princess
is
a
woman
of
the
world
she
knows
what
she
is
doing
and
there
is
a
definite
tie
between
you
i
tell
you
frankly
that
i
could
not
bear
to
see
you
playing
the
idiot
for
a
moment
with
lady
dominey
but
with
the
princess
scruples
do
enter
into
the
question
at
all
you
should
by
no
means
make
an
enemy
of
well
i
have
done
it
dominey
acknowledged
she
has
gone
off
to
bed
now
and
she
is
leaving
early
morning
she
thinks
i
have
borrowed
some
west
african
magic
that
i
have
left
her
lover
soul
out
there
and
come
home
in
his
well
if
she
does
seaman
declared
you
are
out
of
your
am
i
dominey
replied
gloomily
first
of
all
she
may
do
a
lot
of
mischief
before
she
goes
and
then
supposing
by
any
thousand
to
one
chance
the
story
of
this
cousin
of
schmidt
should
be
true
and
she
should
find
dominey
out
there
still
alive
the
princess
is
not
of
german
birth
you
know
she
cares
nothing
for
germany
future
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
like
a
great
many
hungarians
she
prefers
england
they
say
that
an
englishman
has
as
many
lives
as
a
cat
supposing
that
chap
dominey
did
come
to
life
again
and
she
brings
him
home
you
say
yourself
that
you
do
not
mean
to
make
much
use
of
me
until
after
the
war
has
started
in
the
parlance
of
this
country
of
idioms
that
will
rather
upset
the
apple
cart
will
it
not
has
the
princess
a
suite
of
rooms
here
seaman
enquired
over
in
the
west
wing
good
idea
you
go
and
see
what
you
can
do
with
her
she
will
not
think
of
going
to
bed
at
this
time
of
seaman
nodded
leave
it
to
me
he
directed
you
go
out
and
play
the
dominey
played
the
host
first
and
then
the
husband
rosamund
welcomed
him
with
a
little
cry
of
pleasure
i
have
been
enjoying
myself
so
much
everard
she
exclaimed
everybody
has
been
so
kind
and
mangan
has
taught
me
a
new
and
now
i
think
doctor
harrison
intervened
a
little
gruffly
time
to
knock
off
for
the
she
turned
very
sweetly
to
everard
will
you
take
me
upstairs
she
begged
i
have
been
hoping
so
much
that
you
would
come
before
doctor
harrison
sent
me
i
should
have
been
very
disappointed
if
i
had
been
too
late
dominey
assured
her
now
say
good
night
to
why
you
talk
to
me
as
though
i
were
a
child
she
laughed
well
everybody
then
you
see
my
stern
husband
is
taking
me
off
when
are
you
coming
to
see
me
doctor
harrison
nothing
to
see
you
for
was
the
gruff
reply
you
are
as
well
as
any
woman
just
a
little
unsympathetic
is
he
she
complained
to
dominey
please
take
me
through
the
hall
so
that
i
can
say
to
every
one
else
is
the
princess
eiderstrom
there
i
am
afraid
that
she
has
gone
to
bed
dominey
answered
as
they
passed
out
of
the
room
she
said
something
about
a
she
is
very
beautiful
rosamund
said
wistfully
i
wish
she
looked
as
though
she
liked
me
a
little
more
is
she
very
fond
of
you
everard
i
think
that
i
am
rather
in
her
bad
books
just
at
present
dominey
confessed
i
wonder
i
am
very
observant
and
i
have
seen
her
looking
at
you
sometimes
of
course
rosamund
went
on
as
i
am
not
really
your
wife
and
you
are
not
really
my
husband
it
is
very
stupid
of
me
to
feel
jealous
is
it
everard
not
a
bit
he
answered
if
i
am
not
your
husband
i
will
not
be
anybody
i
love
you
to
say
that
she
admitted
with
a
little
sigh
but
it
seems
wrong
somewhere
look
how
cross
the
duchess
looks
some
one
must
have
played
the
wrong
rosamund
farewells
were
not
easily
made
terniloff
especially
seemed
reluctant
to
let
her
go
she
excused
herself
gracefully
however
promising
to
sit
up
a
little
later
the
next
evening
dominey
led
the
way
upstairs
curiously
gratified
at
her
lingering
progress
he
took
her
to
the
door
of
her
room
and
looked
in
the
nurse
was
sitting
in
an
reading
and
the
maid
was
sewing
in
the
background
well
you
look
very
comfortable
here
he
declared
cheerfully
pray
do
not
move
rosamund
held
his
hands
as
though
reluctant
to
let
him
go
then
she
drew
his
face
down
and
kissed
him
yes
she
said
a
little
plaintively
it
very
everard
yes
dear
she
drew
his
head
down
and
whispered
in
his
ear
may
i
come
in
and
say
good
night
for
two
minutes
he
smiled
a
wonderfully
kind
smile
but
shook
his
head
not
dear
he
replied
the
prince
loves
to
sit
up
late
and
i
shall
be
downstairs
with
him
besides
that
bully
of
a
doctor
of
yours
insists
upon
ten
hours
she
sighed
like
a
disappointed
child
very
she
paused
for
a
moment
to
listen
was
that
a
car
she
asked
some
of
our
guests
going
early
i
dare
say
he
replied
as
he
turned
away
chapter
xxiii
seaman
did
not
at
once
start
on
his
mission
to
the
princess
he
made
his
way
instead
to
the
servants
quarters
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
butler
there
was
no
reply
he
tried
the
handle
in
vain
the
door
was
locked
a
tall
man
in
sombre
black
came
out
from
an
adjoining
apartment
you
are
looking
for
the
person
who
arrived
this
evening
from
abroad
sir
he
enquired
i
am
seaman
replied
has
he
locked
himself
in
he
has
left
the
hall
sir
left
seaman
repeated
do
you
mean
gone
away
for
good
apparently
sir
i
do
not
understand
his
language
myself
but
i
believe
he
considered
his
reception
here
for
some
reason
or
other
unfavourable
he
took
advantage
of
the
car
which
went
down
to
the
station
for
the
evening
papers
and
caught
the
last
seaman
was
silent
for
a
moment
the
news
was
a
shock
to
him
what
is
your
position
here
he
asked
his
informant
my
name
is
reynolds
sir
was
the
respectful
reply
i
am
can
you
tell
me
why
if
this
man
has
left
the
door
here
is
locked
mr

reynolds
good
night
sir
seaman
passed
back
again
to
the
crowded
hall
and
exchanged
a
few
remarks
here
and
there
and
made
his
way
up
the
southern
flight
of
stairs
toward
the
west
wing
stephanie
consented
without
hesitation
to
receive
him
she
was
seated
in
front
of
the
fire
reading
a
novel
in
a
boudoir
opening
out
of
her
bedroom
princess
seaman
declared
with
a
low
bow
we
are
in
despair
at
your
she
put
down
her
book
i
have
been
insulted
in
this
house
she
said
i
leave
seaman
shook
his
head
reproachfully
your
highness
he
continued
believe
me
i
do
not
wish
to
presume
upon
my
position
i
am
only
a
german
tradesman
admitted
to
the
circles
like
these
for
reasons
connected
solely
with
the
welfare
of
my
country
yet
i
know
much
as
it
happens
of
the
truth
of
this
matter
the
matter
which
is
causing
you
distress
i
beg
you
to
reconsider
your
decision
our
friend
here
is
i
think
needlessly
hard
upon
himself
so
much
the
greater
will
be
his
reward
when
the
end
comes
so
much
the
greater
will
be
the
rapture
with
which
he
will
throw
himself
on
his
knees
before
has
he
sent
you
to
reason
with
me
not
directly
i
am
to
a
certain
extent
however
his
in
this
enterprise
i
brought
him
from
africa
i
have
watched
over
him
from
the
start
two
brains
are
better
than
one
i
try
to
show
him
where
to
avoid
mistakes
i
try
to
point
out
the
paths
of
danger
and
of
i
should
imagine
sir
everard
finds
you
useful
she
remarked
calmly
i
hope
he
it
has
doubtless
occurred
to
you
she
continued
that
our
friend
has
accommodated
himself
wonderfully
to
english
life
and
customs
you
must
remember
that
he
was
educated
here
nevertheless
his
aptitude
has
been
one
might
almost
call
it
supernatural
she
agreed
tell
me
mr
seaman
you
seem
to
have
been
completely
successful
in
the
installation
of
our
friend
here
as
sir
everard
what
is
going
to
be
his
real
value
to
you
what
work
will
he
do
we
are
keeping
him
for
the
big
things
you
have
seen
our
gracious
master
lately
he
added
hesitatingly
i
know
what
is
at
the
back
of
your
mind
she
replied
yes
before
the
summer
is
over
i
am
to
pack
up
my
trunks
and
fly
i
it
is
when
that
time
comes
seaman
said
impressively
that
we
expect
sir
everard
dominey
the
typical
english
country
gentleman
of
whose
loyalty
there
has
never
been
a
word
of
doubt
to
be
of
use
to
us
most
of
our
present
helpers
will
be
under
suspicion
the
authorised
staff
of
our
secret
service
can
only
work
underneath
you
can
see
for
yourself
the
advantage
we
gain
in
having
a
confidential
correspondent
who
can
day
by
day
reflect
the
changing
psychology
of
the
british
mind
in
all
its
phases
we
have
quite
enough
of
the
other
sort
of
help
arranged
for
plans
of
ships
aerodromes
and
harbours
sailings
of
convoys
calling
up
of
soldiers
all
these
are
the
a
b
c
of
our
secret
service
profession
we
shall
never
ask
our
friend
here
for
a
single
fact
but
from
his
town
house
in
berkeley
square
the
host
of
cabinet
ministers
of
soldiers
of
the
best
brains
of
the
country
our
fingers
will
never
leave
the
pulse
of
britain
day
by
day
stephanie
threw
herself
back
in
her
and
clasped
her
hands
behind
her
head
these
things
you
are
expecting
from
our
present
host
we
are
and
we
expect
to
get
them
i
have
watched
him
day
by
day
my
confidence
in
him
has
stephanie
was
silent
she
sat
looking
into
the
fire
seaman
keenly
observant
as
always
realised
the
change
in
her
yet
found
something
of
mystery
in
her
new
detachment
of
manner
your
highness
he
urged
i
am
not
here
to
speak
on
behalf
of
the
man
who
at
heart
is
i
know
your
lover
he
will
plead
his
own
cause
when
the
time
comes
but
i
am
here
to
plead
for
patience
i
am
here
to
implore
you
to
take
no
rash
step
to
do
nothing
which
might
imperil
in
any
way
his
position
here
i
stand
outside
the
gates
of
the
world
which
your
sex
can
make
a
paradise
i
am
no
judge
of
the
things
that
happen
there
but
in
your
heart
i
feel
there
is
bitterness
because
the
man
for
whom
you
care
has
chosen
to
place
his
country
first
i
implore
your
patience
princess
i
implore
you
to
believe
what
i
know
so
well
that
it
is
the
sternest
sense
of
duty
only
which
is
the
foundation
of
leopold
von
ragastein
obdurate
what
are
you
afraid
that
i
shall
do
she
asked
curiously
i
am
afraid
of
nothing
indirectly
then
answer
me
i
am
afraid
he
admitted
frankly
that
in
some
corner
of
the
world
if
not
in
this
country
you
might
whisper
a
word
a
scoffing
or
an
angry
sentence
which
would
make
people
wonder
what
grudge
you
had
against
a
simple
norfolk
baronet
i
would
not
like
that
word
to
be
spoken
in
the
presence
of
any
one
who
knew
your
history
and
realised
the
rather
amazing
likeness
between
sir
everard
dominey
and
baron
leopold
von
i
see
stephanie
murmured
a
faint
smile
parting
her
lips
well
mr
seaman
i
do
not
think
that
you
need
have
many
fears
what
i
shall
carry
away
with
me
in
my
heart
is
not
for
you
or
any
man
to
know
in
a
few
days
i
shall
leave
this
you
are
going
back
to
berlin
to
hungary
she
shook
her
head
beckoned
her
maid
to
open
the
door
and
held
out
her
hand
in
token
of
dismissal
i
am
going
to
take
a
sea
voyage
she
announced
i
shall
go
to
the
morrow
was
a
day
of
mild
surprises
eddy
pelham
empty
place
was
the
first
to
attract
notice
towards
the
end
of
breakfast
time
where
the
pink
and
white
immaculate
the
right
honourable
gentleman
asked
i
miss
my
morning
wonder
as
to
how
he
tied
his
gone
dominey
replied
looking
round
from
the
sideboard
gone
every
one
repeated
i
should
think
such
a
thing
has
never
happened
to
him
before
dominey
observed
he
was
wanted
in
fancy
any
one
wanting
eddy
for
any
serious
purpose
caroline
murmured
fancy
any
one
wanting
him
badly
enough
to
drag
him
out
of
bed
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
a
telephone
call
and
send
him
up
to
town
by
the
breakfast
train
from
norwich
their
host
continued
i
thought
we
had
started
a
new
ghost
when
he
came
into
my
room
in
a
purple
and
broke
the
who
wanted
him
the
duke
enquired
his
tailor
business
of
importance
was
his
pretext
dominey
replied
there
was
a
little
ripple
of
laughter
does
eddy
do
anything
for
a
living
caroline
asked
yawning
mr
pelham
is
a
director
of
the
chelsea
motor
works
mangan
told
them
he
received
a
small
legacy
last
year
and
his
favourite
taxicab
man
was
the
first
to
know
about
you
not
suggesting
she
exclaimed
that
it
is
business
of
that
sort
which
has
taken
eddy
away
i
should
think
it
most
improbable
mangan
confessed
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
asked
me
the
other
day
if
i
knew
where
their
premises
we
shall
miss
him
she
acknowledged
it
was
quite
one
of
the
events
of
the
day
to
see
his
costume
after
his
bridge
was
reasonably
good
the
duke
commented
he
shot
rather
well
the
last
two
days
mangan
remarked
and
he
had
told
me
confidentially
caroline
concluded
that
he
was
going
to
wear
brown
now
i
think
eddy
would
have
looked
nice
in
the
missing
young
man
requiem
was
finished
by
the
arrival
of
the
local
morning
papers
a
few
moments
later
dominey
rose
and
left
the
room
seaman
who
had
been
unusually
silent
followed
him
my
friend
he
confided
i
do
not
know
whether
you
have
heard
but
there
was
a
curious
disappearance
from
the
hall
last
whose
dominey
asked
pausing
in
the
act
of
selecting
a
cigarette
our
friend
miller
or
wolff
doctor
schmidt
emissary
seaman
announced
has
disappeared
dominey
repeated
i
suppose
he
is
having
a
prowl
round
i
have
left
it
to
you
to
make
more
careful
enquiries
seaman
replied
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
i
made
up
my
mind
last
night
to
interview
him
once
more
and
try
to
fathom
his
very
mysterious
behaviour
i
found
the
door
of
your
butler
locked
and
a
very
civil
fellow
pelham
valet
he
turned
out
to
be
told
me
that
he
had
left
in
the
car
which
went
for
the
evening
i
will
go
and
make
some
enquiries
dominey
decided
after
a
puzzled
consideration
if
you
please
seaman
acquiesced
the
affair
disconcerts
me
because
i
do
not
understand
it
when
there
is
a
thing
which
i
do
not
understand
i
am
dominey
vanished
into
the
nether
regions
spent
half
an
hour
with
rosamund
and
saw
nothing
of
his
disturbed
guest
again
until
they
were
walking
to
the
first
wood
they
had
a
moment
together
after
dominey
had
pointed
out
the
stands
well
seaman
enquired
our
friend
dominey
announced
apparently
made
up
his
mind
to
go
quite
suddenly
a
bed
was
arranged
for
him
or
rather
it
is
always
there
in
a
small
apartment
opening
out
of
the
butler
room
on
the
ground
floor
he
said
nothing
about
leaving
until
he
saw
parkins
preparing
to
go
down
to
the
station
with
the
chauffeur
then
he
insisted
upon
accompanying
him
and
when
he
found
there
was
a
train
to
norwich
he
simply
bade
them
both
good
night
he
left
no
message
whatever
for
either
you
or
seaman
was
thoughtful
there
is
no
doubt
he
said
that
his
departure
was
indicative
of
a
certain
distrust
in
us
he
came
to
find
out
something
and
i
suppose
he
found
it
out
i
envy
you
your
composure
my
friend
we
live
on
the
brink
of
a
volcano
and
you
shoot
we
will
try
a
partridge
for
a
change
dominey
observed
swinging
round
as
a
single
frenchman
with
a
dull
whiz
crossed
the
hedge
behind
them
and
fell
a
little
distance
away
a
crumpled
heap
of
feathers
neat
i
think
he
added
turning
to
his
companion
marvellous
seaman
replied
with
faint
sarcasm
i
envy
your
i
can
not
take
this
matter
very
seriously
dominey
acknowledged
the
fellow
seemed
to
me
quite
my
anxieties
have
also
been
aroused
in
another
direction
seaman
confided
any
other
trouble
looming
dominey
asked
you
will
find
yourself
minus
another
guest
when
you
return
this
the
princess
the
princess
seaman
assented
i
did
my
best
with
her
last
night
but
i
found
her
in
a
most
peculiar
frame
of
mind
we
are
to
be
relieved
of
any
anxiety
concerning
her
for
some
time
however
she
has
decided
to
take
a
sea
where
to
africa
dominey
paused
in
the
act
of
inserting
a
cartridge
into
his
gun
he
turned
slowly
around
and
looked
into
his
companion
expressionless
face
why
the
mischief
is
she
going
out
there
he
asked
i
can
no
more
tell
you
that
seaman
replied
than
why
johann
wolff
was
sent
over
here
to
spy
upon
our
perfect
work
i
am
most
unhappy
my
friend
the
things
which
i
understand
however
threatening
they
are
i
do
not
fear
things
which
i
do
not
understand
oppress
dominey
laughed
quietly
come
he
said
there
is
nothing
here
which
seriously
threatens
our
position
the
princess
is
angry
but
she
is
not
likely
to
give
us
away
this
man
wolff
could
make
no
adverse
report
about
either
of
us
we
are
doing
our
job
and
doing
it
well
let
our
clear
consciences
console
that
is
well
seaman
replied
but
i
feel
uneasy
i
must
not
stay
here
longer
too
intimate
an
association
between
you
and
me
is
well
i
think
i
can
be
trusted
dominey
observed
even
if
i
am
to
be
left
in
every
respect
except
as
regards
the
princess
seaman
admitted
your
deportment
has
been
most
except
as
regards
the
princess
dominey
repeated
irritably
really
my
friend
i
can
not
understand
your
point
of
view
in
this
matter
you
could
not
expect
me
to
mix
up
a
secret
honeymoon
with
my
present
commitments
there
might
surely
have
been
some
middle
way
seaman
persisted
you
show
so
much
tact
in
other
you
do
not
know
the
princess
dominey
muttered
rosamund
joined
them
for
luncheon
bringing
news
of
stephanie
sudden
departure
with
notes
and
messages
for
everybody
caroline
made
a
little
grimace
at
her
host
you
in
trouble
she
whispered
in
his
ear
all
the
same
i
approve
i
like
stephanie
but
she
is
an
exceedingly
dangerous
i
wonder
whether
she
is
dominey
mused
i
think
men
have
generally
found
her
so
caroline
replied
she
had
one
wonderful
love
affair
which
ended
as
you
know
in
her
husband
being
killed
in
a
duel
and
her
lover
being
banished
from
the
country
still
she
not
quite
the
sort
of
woman
to
be
content
with
a
banished
lover
i
fancied
i
noticed
distinct
signs
of
her
being
willing
to
replace
him
whilst
she
has
been
down
here
i
feel
as
though
a
blight
had
settled
upon
my
house
party
dominey
remarked
with
bland
irrelevancy
first
eddy
then
ludwig
miller
and
now
and
who
on
earth
was
ludwig
miller
after
all
caroline
enquired
he
was
a
fat
german
who
brought
me
messages
from
old
friends
in
africa
he
had
no
luggage
but
a
walking
stick
and
he
seems
to
have
upset
the
male
part
of
my
domestics
last
night
by
accepting
a
bed
and
then
disappearing
with
the
plate
not
a
thing
missing
parkins
spent
an
agonised
half
hour
counting
everything
ludwig
appears
to
be
one
of
those
unsolved
mysteries
which
go
to
make
up
an
imperfect
well
we
had
a
jolly
time
caroline
said
reminiscently
henry
and
i
are
off
and
i
suppose
the
others
i
must
say
on
the
whole
i
am
delighted
with
our
you
are
very
gracious
dominey
murmured
i
came
perhaps
expecting
to
see
a
little
more
of
you
she
went
on
deliberately
but
there
is
a
very
great
compensation
for
my
disappointment
i
think
your
wife
everard
is
worth
taking
trouble
about
she
is
perfectly
sweet
and
her
manners
are
most
i
am
very
glad
you
think
that
he
said
warmly
she
looked
away
from
him
everard
she
sighed
i
believe
you
are
in
love
with
your
there
was
a
strange
almost
a
terrible
mixture
of
expressions
in
his
face
as
he
answered
a
certain
fear
a
certain
fondness
a
certain
almost
desperate
resignation
even
his
voice
as
a
rule
so
slow
and
measured
shook
with
an
emotion
which
amazed
his
companion
i
believe
i
am
he
muttered
i
am
afraid
of
my
feelings
for
her
it
may
bring
even
another
tragedy
down
upon
do
talk
rubbish
caroline
exclaimed
what
tragedy
could
come
between
you
now
you
recovered
your
balance
you
are
a
strong
steadfast
person
just
fitted
to
be
the
protector
of
anything
so
sweet
and
charming
as
rosamund
tragedy
indeed
why
do
you
take
her
down
to
the
south
of
france
everard
and
have
your
honeymoon
all
over
again
i
ca
do
that
just
she
studied
him
curiously
there
were
times
when
he
seemed
wholly
incomprehensible
to
her
are
you
still
worried
about
that
unthank
affair
she
asked
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
there
is
still
an
aftermath
to
our
troubles
he
told
her
one
cloud
which
leans
over
us
i
shall
clear
it
up
in
time
but
other
things
may
happen
you
take
yourself
very
seriously
everard
she
observed
looking
at
him
with
a
puzzled
expression
one
would
think
that
there
was
a
side
of
your
life
and
a
very
important
one
which
you
kept
entirely
to
yourself
why
do
you
have
that
funny
little
man
seaman
always
round
with
you
you
not
being
blackmailed
or
anything
are
you
on
the
contrary
he
told
her
seaman
was
the
first
founder
of
my
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
have
made
a
little
money
once
or
twice
on
the
stock
exchange
she
remarked
but
i
did
have
to
carry
my
broker
about
in
my
pocket
seaman
is
a
little
fellow
and
he
loves
companionship
he
will
drift
away
presently
and
one
wo
see
anything
of
him
for
henry
began
to
wonder
she
concluded
drily
whether
you
were
going
to
stand
for
parliament
on
the
alliance
dominey
laughed
as
he
caught
middleton
reproachful
eye
in
the
doorway
of
the
farmer
kitchen
in
which
they
were
hunching
he
gave
the
signal
to
rise
i
have
had
some
thoughts
of
parliament
he
admitted
but
well
henry
need
not
chapter
xxiv
the
next
morning
saw
the
of
dominey
carefully
arranged
shooting
party
the
prince
took
his
host
arm
and
led
him
to
one
side
for
a
few
moments
as
the
cars
were
being
loaded
up
his
first
few
words
were
of
formal
thanks
he
spoke
then
more
intimately
von
ragastein
he
said
i
desire
to
refer
back
for
a
moment
to
our
conversation
the
other
dominey
shook
his
head
and
glanced
behind
i
know
only
one
name
here
dominey
then
i
will
confess
that
you
play
and
carry
the
part
through
perfectly
i
have
known
english
gentlemen
all
my
life
and
you
have
the
trick
of
the
thing
but
listen
i
have
already
told
you
of
my
disapproval
of
this
scheme
in
which
you
are
the
central
it
is
understood
dominey
assented
that
the
prince
continued
is
a
personal
matter
what
i
am
now
going
to
say
to
you
is
official
i
had
despatches
from
berlin
last
night
they
concern
dominey
seemed
to
stiffen
a
little
well
i
am
given
to
understand
the
ambassador
continued
that
you
practically
exist
only
in
the
event
of
that
catastrophe
which
i
for
one
can
not
foresee
i
am
assured
that
if
your
exposé
should
take
place
at
any
time
your
personation
will
be
regarded
as
a
private
enterprise
and
there
is
nothing
whatever
to
connect
you
with
any
political
up
to
the
present
that
is
absolutely
so
dominey
agreed
i
am
further
advised
to
look
upon
you
as
my
unnamed
and
unsuspected
successor
here
in
the
event
of
war
for
that
reason
i
am
begged
to
inaugurate
terms
of
intimacy
with
you
to
treat
you
with
the
utmost
confidence
and
if
the
black
end
should
come
to
leave
in
your
hands
all
such
unfulfilled
work
as
can
be
continued
in
secrecy
and
silence
i
perhaps
express
myself
in
a
somewhat
confused
i
understand
perfectly
dominey
replied
the
authorities
have
changed
their
first
idea
as
to
my
presence
here
they
want
to
keep
every
shadow
of
suspicion
away
from
me
so
that
in
the
event
of
war
i
shall
have
an
absolutely
unique
position
an
unsuspected
yet
fervently
patriotic
german
living
hand
in
glove
with
the
upper
classes
of
english
society
one
can
well
imagine
that
there
would
be
work
for
our
understanding
is
mutual
terniloff
declared
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
therefore
is
that
i
hope
you
will
soon
follow
us
to
london
and
give
me
the
opportunity
of
offering
you
the
constant
hospitality
of
carlton
house
you
are
very
kind
prince
dominey
said
my
instructions
are
as
soon
as
i
have
consolidated
my
position
here
an
event
which
i
fancy
i
may
consider
attained
to
establish
myself
in
london
and
to
await
orders
i
trust
that
amongst
other
things
you
will
then
permit
me
to
examine
the
memoirs
you
spoke
of
the
other
naturally
and
with
the
utmost
pleasure
the
ambassador
assented
they
are
a
faithful
record
of
my
interviews
and
negotiations
with
certain
ministers
here
and
they
reflect
a
desire
and
intention
for
peace
which
will
i
think
amaze
you
i
venture
now
upon
a
somewhat
delicate
question
he
continued
changing
the
subject
of
their
conversation
abruptly
as
they
turned
back
along
the
terrace
lady
dominey
will
accompany
you
of
that
i
am
not
sure
dominey
replied
thoughtfully
i
have
noticed
prince
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
say
so
your
chivalrous
regard
for
that
lady
you
will
permit
me
to
assure
you
that
in
the
peculiar
position
in
which
i
am
placed
i
shall
never
forget
that
she
is
the
wife
of
everard
terniloff
shook
hands
heartily
i
wanted
to
hear
that
from
you
he
admitted
you
i
felt
instinctively
were
different
but
there
are
many
men
of
our
race
who
are
willing
enough
to
sacrifice
a
woman
without
the
slightest
scruple
either
for
their
passions
or
their
policy
i
find
lady
dominey
she
will
never
lack
a
protector
in
me
dominey
declared
there
were
more
farewells
and
soon
after
the
little
procession
of
cars
drove
off
rosamund
herself
was
on
the
terrace
bidding
all
her
guests
farewell
she
clung
to
dominey
arm
when
at
last
they
turned
back
into
the
empty
hall
what
dear
people
they
were
everard
she
exclaimed
i
only
wish
that
i
had
seen
more
of
them
the
duchess
was
perfectly
charming
to
me
and
i
never
knew
any
one
with
such
delightful
manners
as
prince
terniloff
are
you
going
to
miss
them
very
much
dear
not
a
bit
he
answered
i
think
i
shall
take
a
gun
now
and
stroll
down
the
meadows
and
across
the
rough
ground
will
you
come
with
me
or
will
you
put
on
one
of
your
pretty
gowns
and
entertain
me
downstairs
at
luncheon
it
is
a
very
long
time
since
we
had
a
meal
alone
she
shook
her
head
a
little
sadly
we
never
have
had
she
answered
you
know
that
everard
and
alas
i
know
it
but
we
are
going
on
pretending
are
we
he
raised
her
fingers
to
his
lips
and
kissed
them
you
shall
pretend
all
that
you
like
dear
rosamund
he
promised
and
i
will
be
the
shadow
of
your
desires
no
no
tears
he
added
quickly
as
she
turned
away
remember
there
is
nothing
but
happiness
for
you
now
whoever
i
am
or
am
not
that
is
my
one
aim
in
she
clutched
at
his
hand
passionately
and
suddenly
as
though
finding
it
insufficient
twined
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
kissed
him
let
me
come
with
you
she
begged
i
ca
bear
to
let
you
go
i
be
very
quiet
will
you
wait
ten
minutes
for
me
of
course
he
answered
he
strolled
down
towards
the
gun
room
stood
by
the
fire
for
a
moment
and
then
wandered
out
into
the
courtyard
where
middleton
and
a
couple
of
beaters
were
waiting
for
him
with
the
dogs
he
had
scarcely
taken
a
step
towards
them
however
when
he
stopped
short
to
his
amazement
seaman
was
there
standing
a
little
on
one
side
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
windows
of
the
servants
quarters
hullo
my
friend
he
exclaimed
why
i
thought
you
went
by
the
early
train
from
thursford
station
missed
it
by
two
minutes
seaman
replied
with
a
glance
towards
the
beaters
i
knew
all
the
cars
were
full
for
the
eleven
so
i
thought
i
wait
till
the
and
where
have
you
been
to
for
the
last
few
hours
then
seaman
had
reached
his
side
now
and
was
out
of
earshot
of
the
others
trying
to
solve
the
mystery
of
johann
wolff
sudden
departure
last
night
come
and
walk
down
the
avenue
with
me
a
short
a
very
short
distance
then
i
am
expecting
lady
they
passed
through
the
thin
iron
gates
and
paced
along
one
of
the
back
entrances
to
the
hall
do
not
think
me
indiscreet
seaman
began
i
returned
without
the
knowledge
of
any
one
and
i
kept
out
of
the
way
until
they
had
all
gone
it
is
what
i
told
you
before
things
which
i
do
not
understand
depress
me
and
behold
i
have
found
proof
this
morning
of
a
further
significance
in
wolff
sudden
proceed
dominey
begged
i
learned
this
morning
entirely
by
accident
that
pelham
servant
was
either
mistaken
or
willfully
deceived
me
wolff
did
not
accompany
your
butler
to
the
and
how
did
you
find
that
out
dominey
demanded
it
is
immaterial
what
is
material
is
that
there
is
a
sort
of
conspiracy
amongst
the
servants
here
to
conceal
the
manner
of
his
leaving
do
not
interrupt
me
i
beg
early
this
morning
there
was
a
fresh
fall
of
snow
which
has
now
disappeared
outside
the
window
of
the
room
which
i
found
locked
were
the
marks
of
footsteps
and
the
tracks
of
a
small
and
what
do
you
gather
from
all
this
dominey
asked
i
gather
that
wolff
must
have
had
friends
in
the
neighbourhood
seaman
replied
or
else
well
my
last
supposition
sounds
absurd
seaman
confessed
but
the
whole
matter
is
so
incomprehensible
that
i
was
going
to
say
or
else
he
was
forcibly
dominey
laughed
softly
wolff
would
scarcely
have
been
an
easy
man
to
abduct
would
he
he
remarked
even
if
we
could
hit
upon
any
plausible
reason
for
such
a
thing
as
a
matter
of
fact
seaman
he
concluded
turning
on
his
heel
a
little
abruptly
as
he
saw
rosamund
standing
in
the
avenue
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
treat
this
johann
wolff
business
seriously
granted
that
the
man
was
a
spy
well
let
him
get
on
with
it
we
are
doing
our
job
here
in
the
most
perfect
and
praiseworthy
fashion
we
neither
of
us
have
the
ghost
of
a
secret
to
hide
from
his
in
a
sense
that
is
true
seaman
admitted
well
then
cheer
up
dominey
enjoined
take
a
little
walk
with
us
and
we
will
see
whether
parkins
can
not
find
us
a
bottle
of
that
old
burgundy
for
lunch
how
does
that
sound
if
you
will
excuse
me
from
taking
the
walk
seaman
begged
i
would
like
to
remain
here
until
your
you
are
more
likely
to
do
harm
dominey
reminded
him
and
set
the
servants
talking
if
you
show
too
much
interest
in
this
i
shall
be
careful
seaman
promised
but
there
are
certain
things
which
i
can
not
help
i
work
always
from
instinct
and
my
instinct
is
never
wrong
i
will
ask
no
more
questions
of
your
servants
but
i
know
that
there
is
something
mysterious
about
the
sudden
departure
of
johann
dominey
and
rosamund
returned
about
one
to
find
a
note
from
seaman
which
the
former
tore
open
as
his
companion
stood
warming
her
feet
in
front
of
the
fire
there
were
only
a
few
lines
i
am
following
an
idea
it
takes
me
to
london
let
us
meet
there
within
a
few
days
has
he
really
gone
rosamund
asked
back
to
she
laughed
happily
then
we
shall
lunch
after
all
delightful
i
have
my
wish
there
was
a
sudden
glow
in
dominey
face
a
glow
which
was
instantly
suppressed
shall
i
ever
have
mine
he
asked
with
a
queer
little
break
in
his
voice
chapter
xxv
terniloff
and
dominey
one
morning
about
six
months
later
lounged
underneath
a
great
elm
tree
at
ranelagh
having
iced
drinks
after
a
round
of
golf
several
millions
of
perspiring
englishmen
were
at
the
same
moment
studying
with
dazed
wonder
the
headlines
in
the
midday
papers
i
suppose
the
ambassador
remarked
as
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
an
air
of
lazy
content
that
i
am
being
accused
of
fiddling
while
rome
every
one
has
certainly
not
your
confidence
in
the
situation
dominey
rejoined
calmly
there
is
no
one
else
who
knows
quite
so
much
terniloff
reminded
him
dominey
sipped
his
drink
for
a
moment
or
two
in
silence
have
you
the
latest
news
of
the
russian
mobilisation
he
asked
they
had
some
startling
figures
in
the
city
this
the
prince
waved
his
hand
my
faith
is
not
founded
on
these
extraneous
incidents
he
replied
if
russia
mobilises
it
is
for
defence
no
nation
in
the
world
would
dream
of
attacking
germany
nor
has
germany
the
slightest
intention
of
imperilling
her
coming
supremacy
amongst
the
nations
by
such
crude
methods
as
military
enterprise
servia
must
be
punished
naturally
but
to
that
in
principle
every
nation
in
europe
is
agreed
we
shall
not
permit
austria
to
overstep
the
you
are
at
least
consistent
prince
dominey
remarked
terniloff
smiled
that
is
because
i
have
been
taken
behind
the
scenes
he
said
i
have
been
shown
as
is
the
privilege
of
ambassadors
the
mind
of
our
rulers
you
my
friend
he
went
on
spent
your
youth
amongst
the
military
faction
you
think
that
you
are
the
most
important
people
in
germany
well
you
are
not
the
kaiser
has
willed
it
otherwise
i
had
yesterday
a
most
extraordinary
cable
from
dominey
ceased
swinging
his
putter
carelessly
over
the
head
of
a
daisy
and
turned
his
head
to
listen
is
she
on
the
way
home
she
is
due
in
southampton
at
any
moment
now
she
wants
to
know
where
she
can
see
me
immediately
upon
her
arrival
as
she
has
information
of
the
utmost
importance
to
give
did
she
ever
tell
you
the
reason
for
her
journey
to
africa
she
was
most
mysterious
about
it
if
such
an
idea
had
had
any
logical
outcome
i
should
have
surmised
that
she
was
going
there
to
seek
information
as
to
your
she
gave
seaman
the
same
idea
dominey
observed
i
scarcely
see
what
she
has
to
gain
in
africa
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
went
on
my
life
would
bear
the
strictest
the
whole
affair
is
singularly
foolish
the
prince
declared
still
i
am
not
sure
that
you
have
been
altogether
wise
even
accepting
your
position
i
see
no
reason
why
you
should
not
have
obeyed
the
behest
my
experience
of
your
society
here
is
that
love
affairs
between
men
and
women
moving
in
the
same
circles
are
not
that
dominey
urged
is
when
they
are
all
tarred
with
the
same
brush
my
behaviour
towards
lady
dominey
has
been
culpable
enough
as
it
is
to
have
placed
her
in
the
position
of
a
neglected
wife
would
have
been
indefensible
further
it
might
have
affected
the
position
which
it
is
in
the
interests
of
my
work
that
i
should
maintain
an
old
subject
the
ambassador
sighed
best
not
rediscussed
behold
our
womenkind
rosamund
and
the
princess
had
issued
from
the
house
and
the
two
men
hastened
to
meet
them
the
latter
looked
charming
exquisitely
gowned
and
stately
in
appearance
by
her
side
rosamund
dressed
with
the
same
success
but
in
younger
fashion
seemed
almost
like
a
child
they
passed
into
the
luncheon
room
crowded
with
many
little
parties
of
distinguished
and
interesting
people
brilliant
with
the
red
livery
of
the
waiters
the
profusion
of
flowers
all
that
nameless
elegance
which
had
made
the
place
society
most
popular
rendezvous
the
women
as
they
settled
into
their
places
asked
a
question
which
was
on
the
lips
of
a
great
many
english
people
of
that
day
is
there
any
news
terniloff
perhaps
felt
that
he
was
the
cynosure
of
many
eager
and
anxious
eyes
he
smiled
as
he
answered
none
if
there
were
i
am
convinced
that
it
would
be
good
i
have
been
allowed
to
play
out
my
titanic
struggle
against
sir
everard
without
i
suppose
the
next
important
question
is
to
whether
it
is
to
be
peace
or
war
is
how
did
you
play
the
princess
asked
i
surpassed
myself
her
husband
replied
but
of
course
no
ordinary
human
golfer
is
of
any
account
against
dominey
he
plays
far
too
well
for
any
ger
the
ambassador
broke
off
and
paused
while
he
helped
himself
to
mayonnaise
for
any
german
to
play
against
he
concluded
luncheon
was
a
very
pleasant
meal
and
a
good
many
people
noticed
the
vivacity
of
the
beautiful
lady
dominey
whose
picture
was
beginning
to
appear
in
the
illustrated
papers
afterwards
they
drank
coffee
and
sipped
liqueurs
under
the
great
elm
tree
on
the
lawn
listening
to
the
music
and
congratulating
themselves
upon
having
made
their
escape
from
london
in
the
panorama
of
women
and
men
the
monotony
of
which
was
varied
here
and
there
by
the
passing
of
a
diplomatist
or
a
frenchman
scrupulously
attired
in
morning
clothes
were
many
familiar
faces
caroline
and
a
little
group
of
friends
waved
to
them
from
the
terrace
eddy
pelham
in
immaculate
white
and
a
long
tennis
coat
with
dark
blue
edgings
paused
to
speak
to
them
on
his
way
to
the
courts
how
is
the
motor
business
eddy
dominey
asked
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
so
so
i
not
quite
so
keen
as
i
was
to
tell
you
the
truth
the
young
man
confided
glancing
around
and
lowering
his
voice
so
that
no
one
should
share
the
momentous
information
i
was
lucky
enough
to
pick
up
a
small
share
in
jere
moore
racing
stable
at
newmarket
the
other
day
i
fancy
i
know
a
little
more
about
than
i
do
about
the
inside
of
motors
what
i
should
think
very
possibly
that
you
are
right
dominey
assented
as
the
young
man
passed
on
with
a
farewell
salute
terniloff
looked
after
him
curiously
it
is
the
type
of
young
man
that
he
declared
which
we
can
not
understand
what
would
happen
to
him
in
the
event
of
a
war
in
the
event
of
his
being
called
upon
say
either
to
fight
or
do
some
work
of
national
importance
for
his
country
i
expect
he
would
do
it
dominey
replied
he
would
do
it
pluckily
and
badly
he
is
a
type
of
the
young
englishman
and
entirely
undisciplined
they
expect
and
their
country
expects
for
them
that
in
the
case
of
emergency
pluck
would
take
the
place
of
the
right
honourable
gerald
watson
stood
upon
the
steps
talking
to
the
wife
of
the
italian
ambassador
she
left
him
presently
and
he
came
strolling
down
the
lawn
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
his
eyes
seeming
to
see
out
past
the
golf
links
there
goes
a
man
terniloff
murmured
whom
lately
i
have
found
changed
when
i
first
came
here
he
met
me
quite
openly
i
believe
even
now
he
is
sincerely
desirous
of
peace
and
amicable
relations
between
our
two
countries
and
yet
something
has
fallen
between
us
i
can
not
tell
what
it
is
i
can
not
tell
even
of
what
nature
it
is
but
i
have
an
instinct
for
people
attitude
towards
me
and
the
english
are
the
worst
race
in
the
world
at
hiding
their
feelings
has
watson
i
wonder
come
under
the
spell
of
your
connection
the
duke
of
worcester
he
seemed
so
friendly
with
both
of
us
down
in
their
womenkind
left
them
at
that
moment
to
talk
to
some
acquaintances
seated
a
short
distance
way
watson
passing
within
a
few
yards
of
them
was
brought
to
a
standstill
by
dominey
greeting
they
talked
for
a
moment
or
two
upon
idle
subjects
your
news
i
trust
continues
favourable
the
ambassador
remarked
observing
the
etiquette
which
required
him
to
be
the
first
to
leave
the
realms
of
ordinary
conversation
it
is
a
little
negative
in
quality
the
other
answered
after
a
moment
hesitation
i
am
summoned
to
downing
street
again
at
six
i
have
already
confided
the
result
of
my
morning
despatches
to
the
prime
minister
terniloff
observed
i
went
through
them
before
i
came
down
here
was
the
somewhat
doubtful
reply
you
will
have
appreciated
i
hope
their
genuinely
pacific
tone
terniloff
asked
anxiously
his
interlocutor
bowed
and
then
drew
himself
up
it
was
obvious
that
the
strain
of
the
last
few
days
was
telling
upon
him
there
were
lines
about
his
mouth
and
his
eyes
spoke
of
sleepless
nights
words
are
idle
things
to
deal
with
at
a
time
like
this
he
said
one
thing
however
i
will
venture
to
say
to
you
prince
here
and
under
these
circumstances
there
will
be
no
war
unless
it
be
the
will
of
your
terniloff
was
for
a
moment
unusually
pale
it
was
an
episode
of
unrecorded
history
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
raised
his
hat
there
will
be
no
war
he
said
solemnly
the
cabinet
minister
passed
on
with
a
lighter
step
dominey
more
clearly
than
ever
before
understood
the
subtle
policy
which
had
chosen
for
his
great
position
a
man
as
chivalrous
and
faithful
and
yet
as
as
terniloff
he
looked
after
the
retreating
figure
of
the
cabinet
minister
with
a
slight
smile
at
the
corner
of
his
lips
in
a
time
like
this
he
remarked
significantly
one
begins
to
understand
why
one
of
our
great
writers
was
it
bernhardi
i
wonder
has
written
that
no
island
could
ever
breed
a
race
of
the
seas
which
engirdle
this
island
the
ambassador
said
thoughtfully
have
brought
the
english
great
weal
as
they
may
bring
to
her
much
woe
the
brain
of
the
diplomat
has
its
parallel
of
insincerity
in
the
people
whose
interests
he
seems
to
guard
i
believe
in
the
honesty
of
the
english
politicians
i
have
placed
that
belief
on
record
in
the
small
volume
of
memoirs
which
i
shall
presently
entrust
to
you
but
we
talk
too
seriously
for
a
summer
afternoon
let
us
illustrate
to
the
world
our
opinion
of
the
political
situation
and
play
another
nine
holes
at
dominey
rose
willingly
to
his
feet
and
the
two
men
strolled
away
towards
the
first
tee
by
the
by
terniloff
asked
what
of
our
cheerful
little
friend
seaman
he
ought
to
be
busy
just
curiously
enough
he
is
returning
from
germany
dominey
announced
i
expect
him
at
berkeley
square
he
is
coming
direct
to
chapter
xxvi
these
were
days
to
all
dwellers
in
london
of
vivid
impressions
of
poignant
memories
reasserting
themselves
afterwards
with
a
curious
sense
of
unreality
as
though
belonging
to
another
set
of
days
and
another
world
dominey
long
remembered
his
dinner
that
evening
in
the
sombre
handsomely
furnished
of
his
town
house
in
berkeley
square
although
it
lacked
the
splendid
proportions
of
the
banqueting
hall
at
dominey
it
was
still
a
fine
apartment
furnished
in
the
georgian
period
with
some
notable
pictures
upon
the
walls
and
with
a
wonderful
ceiling
and
fireplace
dominey
and
rosamund
dined
alone
and
though
the
table
had
been
reduced
to
its
smallest
proportions
the
space
between
them
was
yet
considerable
as
soon
as
parkins
had
gravely
put
the
port
upon
the
table
rosamund
rose
to
her
feet
and
instead
of
leaving
the
room
pointed
for
the
servant
to
place
a
chair
for
her
by
dominey
side
i
shall
be
like
your
men
friends
everard
she
declared
when
the
ladies
have
left
and
draw
up
to
your
side
now
what
do
we
do
tell
stories
i
promise
you
that
i
will
be
a
wonderful
first
of
all
you
drink
half
a
glass
of
this
port
he
declared
filling
her
glass
then
you
peel
me
one
of
those
peaches
and
we
divide
it
after
which
we
listen
for
a
ring
at
the
bell
i
expect
a
a
visitor
not
a
social
one
he
assured
her
a
matter
of
business
which
i
fear
will
take
me
from
you
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
so
let
us
make
the
most
of
the
time
until
he
she
commenced
her
task
with
the
peach
talking
to
him
all
the
time
a
little
gravely
a
sweet
and
picturesque
picture
of
a
graceful
and
very
desirable
woman
her
delicate
shape
and
artistic
fragility
more
than
ever
accentuated
by
the
sombreness
of
the
background
do
you
know
everard
she
said
i
am
so
happy
in
london
here
with
you
and
i
feel
all
the
time
so
strong
and
well
i
can
read
and
understand
the
books
which
were
a
maze
of
print
to
me
before
i
can
see
the
things
in
the
pictures
and
feel
the
thrill
of
the
music
which
seemed
to
come
to
me
somehow
before
all
dislocated
and
discordant
you
understand
dear
of
course
he
answered
gravely
i
do
not
wonder
she
went
on
that
doctor
harrison
is
proud
of
me
for
a
patient
but
there
are
many
times
when
i
feel
a
dull
pain
in
my
heart
because
i
know
that
whatever
he
or
anybody
else
might
say
i
am
not
quite
rosamund
dear
he
protested
ah
but
do
interrupt
she
insisted
depositing
his
share
of
the
peach
upon
his
plate
how
can
i
be
cured
when
all
the
time
there
is
the
problem
of
you
the
problem
which
i
am
just
as
far
off
solving
as
ever
i
was
often
i
find
myself
comparing
you
with
the
everard
whom
i
do
i
fail
so
often
to
come
up
to
his
standard
he
asked
you
never
fail
she
answered
looking
at
him
with
brimming
eyes
of
course
he
was
very
much
more
affectionate
she
went
on
after
a
moment
pause
his
kisses
were
not
like
yours
and
he
was
far
fonder
of
having
me
with
him
then
on
the
other
hand
often
when
i
wanted
him
he
was
not
there
he
did
wild
things
mad
things
he
seemed
to
forget
me
altogether
it
was
that
she
went
on
that
was
so
terrible
it
was
that
which
made
me
so
nervous
i
think
that
i
should
even
have
been
able
to
stand
those
awful
moments
when
he
came
back
to
me
covered
with
blood
and
reeling
if
it
had
not
been
that
i
was
already
almost
a
wreck
you
know
he
killed
roger
unthank
that
night
that
is
why
he
was
never
able
to
come
why
do
you
talk
of
these
things
rosamund
dominey
begged
i
must
dear
she
insisted
laying
her
fingers
upon
his
hand
and
looking
at
him
curiously
i
must
even
though
i
see
how
they
distress
you
it
is
wonderful
that
you
should
mind
so
much
everard
but
you
do
and
i
love
you
for
mind
he
groaned
mind
you
are
so
like
him
and
yet
so
different
she
went
on
meditatively
you
drink
so
little
wine
you
are
always
so
so
serious
you
live
as
though
you
had
a
life
around
you
of
which
others
knew
nothing
the
everard
i
remember
would
never
have
cared
about
being
a
magistrate
or
going
into
parliament
he
would
have
spent
his
time
racing
or
yachting
hunting
or
shooting
as
the
fancy
took
him
and
yet
and
yet
what
dominey
asked
a
little
hoarsely
i
think
he
loved
me
better
than
you
she
said
very
sadly
why
he
demanded
i
can
not
tell
you
she
answered
with
her
eyes
upon
her
plate
but
i
think
that
he
dominey
walked
suddenly
to
the
window
and
leaned
out
there
were
drops
of
moisture
upon
his
forehead
he
felt
the
fierce
need
of
air
when
he
came
back
she
was
still
sitting
there
still
looking
down
i
have
spoken
to
doctor
harrison
about
it
she
went
on
her
voice
scarcely
audible
he
told
me
that
you
probably
loved
more
than
you
dared
to
show
because
someday
the
real
everard
might
come
that
is
quite
true
he
reminded
her
softly
he
may
come
back
at
any
she
gripped
his
hand
her
voice
shook
with
passion
she
leaned
towards
him
her
other
arm
stole
around
his
neck
but
i
do
want
him
to
come
back
she
cried
i
want
you
dominey
sat
for
a
moment
motionless
like
a
figure
of
stone
through
the
windows
came
the
raucous
cry
of
a
newsboy
breaking
the
stillness
of
the
summer
evening
and
then
another
and
sharper
interruption
the
stopping
of
a
taxicab
outside
the
firm
insistent
ringing
of
the
front
doorbell
recollection
came
to
dominey
and
a
great
strength
the
fire
which
had
leaped
up
within
him
was
thrust
back
his
response
to
her
wave
of
passion
was
infinitely
tender
dear
rosamund
he
said
that
front
doorbell
summons
me
to
rather
an
important
interview
will
you
please
trust
in
me
a
little
while
longer
believe
me
i
am
not
in
any
way
cold
i
am
not
indifferent
there
is
something
which
you
will
have
to
be
told
something
with
which
i
never
reckoned
something
which
is
beginning
to
weigh
upon
me
night
and
day
trust
me
rosamund
and
wait
she
sank
back
into
her
chair
with
a
piquant
and
yet
pathetic
little
grimace
you
tell
me
always
to
wait
she
complained
i
will
be
patient
but
you
shall
tell
me
this
you
are
so
kind
to
me
you
make
or
mar
my
life
you
must
care
a
little
please
he
was
standing
up
now
he
kissed
her
hands
fondly
his
voice
had
all
the
old
ring
in
it
more
than
for
any
woman
on
earth
dear
rosamund
seaman
in
a
light
grey
suit
a
panama
and
a
white
beflowered
tie
had
lost
something
of
the
placid
urbanity
of
a
few
months
ago
he
was
hot
and
tired
with
travel
there
were
new
lines
in
his
face
and
a
queer
expression
of
anxiety
about
his
eyes
at
the
corners
of
which
little
wrinkles
had
begun
to
appear
he
responded
to
dominey
welcome
with
a
fervour
which
was
almost
feverish
scrutinised
him
closely
as
though
expecting
to
find
some
change
and
finally
sank
into
an
with
a
little
gesture
of
relief
he
had
been
carrying
a
small
brown
despatch
case
which
he
laid
on
the
carpet
by
his
side
you
have
news
dominey
asked
yes
was
the
momentous
reply
i
have
dominey
rang
the
bell
he
had
already
surmised
from
the
and
coats
in
the
hall
that
his
visitor
had
come
direct
from
the
station
what
will
you
have
he
enquired
a
bottle
of
hock
with
seltzer
water
and
ice
if
you
have
it
seaman
replied
also
a
plate
of
cold
meat
but
it
must
be
served
here
and
afterwards
the
biggest
cigar
you
have
i
have
indeed
news
news
disturbing
news
magnificent
news
dominey
gave
some
orders
to
the
servant
who
answered
his
summons
for
a
few
moments
they
spoke
trivialities
of
the
journey
when
everything
was
served
however
and
the
door
closed
seaman
could
wait
no
longer
his
appetite
his
thirst
his
speech
seemed
all
stimulated
to
swift
action
we
are
of
the
same
temperament
he
said
that
i
know
we
will
speak
first
of
what
is
more
than
disturbing
a
little
terrifying
the
mystery
of
johann
wolff
has
been
the
man
who
came
to
us
with
messages
from
schmidt
in
south
africa
dominey
asked
i
had
almost
forgotten
about
the
same
what
was
at
the
back
of
his
visit
to
us
that
night
i
can
not
even
now
imagine
neither
is
it
clear
why
he
held
aloof
from
me
who
am
his
superior
in
practically
the
same
service
there
we
are
from
the
commencement
confronted
with
a
very
singular
happening
but
scarcely
so
singular
as
the
denouement
wolff
vanished
from
your
house
that
night
into
an
english
it
seems
incredible
dominey
declared
bluntly
it
is
nevertheless
true
seaman
insisted
no
member
of
our
service
is
allowed
to
remain
more
than
one
month
without
communicating
his
existence
and
whereabouts
to
headquarters
no
word
has
been
received
from
wolff
since
that
night
in
january
on
the
other
hand
indirect
information
has
reached
us
that
he
is
in
durance
over
but
such
a
thing
is
against
the
law
unheard
of
dominey
protested
no
country
can
keep
the
citizen
of
another
country
in
prison
without
formulating
a
definite
charge
or
bringing
him
up
for
seaman
smiled
grimly
that
all
very
well
in
any
ordinary
case
he
said
wolff
has
been
a
marked
man
for
years
though
wilhelmstrasse
would
soon
make
fuss
enough
if
it
were
of
any
use
but
it
would
not
be
there
are
one
or
two
englishmen
in
german
prisons
at
the
present
moment
concerning
whose
welfare
the
english
foreign
office
has
not
even
thought
it
worth
while
to
enquire
what
troubles
me
more
than
the
actual
fact
of
disappearance
is
the
mystery
of
his
visit
to
you
and
his
apprehension
practically
on
the
they
must
have
tracked
him
down
there
dominey
remarked
yes
but
they
could
thrust
a
pair
of
tongs
into
your
extract
johann
wolff
and
set
him
down
inside
norwich
castle
or
whatever
prison
he
may
be
in
seaman
objected
however
the
most
disquieting
feature
about
wolff
is
that
it
introduces
something
we
do
understand
for
the
rest
we
have
many
men
as
good
and
better
and
the
time
for
their
utility
is
past
you
are
our
great
hope
now
it
is
to
be
then
seaman
took
a
long
and
ecstatic
draught
of
his
hock
and
seltzer
it
is
to
be
he
declared
solemnly
there
was
never
any
doubt
about
it
if
russia
ceases
to
mobilise
if
every
statesman
in
servia
crawls
to
vienna
with
a
rope
around
his
neck
the
result
would
still
be
the
same
the
word
has
gone
out
the
whole
of
germany
is
like
a
vast
military
camp
it
comes
exactly
twelve
months
before
the
final
day
fixed
by
our
great
authorities
but
the
opportunity
is
too
great
too
wonderful
for
hesitation
by
the
end
of
august
we
shall
be
in
you
bring
news
indeed
dominey
murmured
standing
for
a
moment
by
the
opened
window
i
have
been
received
with
favour
in
the
very
loftiest
circles
seaman
continued
you
and
i
both
stand
high
in
the
list
of
those
to
whom
great
rewards
shall
come
his
majesty
approves
altogether
of
your
reluctance
to
avail
yourself
of
his
permission
to
wed
the
princess
eiderstrom
ragastein
has
decided
well
he
declared
are
not
the
days
for
marriage
or
giving
in
marriage
these
the
most
momentous
days
the
world
has
ever
known
the
days
when
an
empire
shall
spring
into
being
the
mightiest
since
the
continents
fell
into
shape
and
the
stars
looked
down
upon
this
present
world
those
are
the
words
of
the
all
highest
in
his
eyes
the
greatest
of
all
attributes
is
singleness
of
purpose
you
followed
your
own
purpose
contrary
to
my
advice
contrary
to
terniloff
you
will
gain
by
seaman
finished
his
meal
in
due
course
and
the
tray
was
removed
soon
the
two
men
were
alone
again
seaman
puffing
out
dense
volumes
of
smoke
gripping
his
cigar
between
his
teeth
brandishing
it
sometimes
in
his
hand
to
give
effect
to
his
words
a
little
of
his
marvellous
caution
seemed
to
have
deserted
him
for
the
first
time
he
spoke
directly
to
his
companion
von
ragastein
he
said
it
is
a
great
country
ours
it
is
a
wonderful
empire
we
shall
build
i
am
on
fire
with
the
mighty
things
i
have
a
list
of
instructions
for
you
many
details
they
can
wait
we
will
talk
of
our
future
our
great
and
glorious
destiny
as
the
mightiest
nation
who
has
ever
earned
for
herself
the
right
to
govern
the
world
you
would
think
that
in
germany
there
was
excitement
there
is
none
the
task
of
every
one
is
allotted
their
work
made
clear
to
them
like
a
mighty
piece
of
gigantic
machinery
we
move
towards
war
every
regiment
knows
its
station
every
battery
commander
knows
his
positions
every
general
knows
his
exact
line
of
attack
rations
clothing
hospitals
every
unit
of
which
you
can
think
has
its
movements
calculated
out
for
it
to
the
last
and
the
final
result
dominey
asked
is
that
also
calculated
seaman
with
trembling
fingers
unlocked
the
little
despatch
box
which
stood
by
his
side
and
took
from
it
jealously
a
sheet
of
parchment
you
my
friend
he
said
are
one
of
the
first
to
gaze
upon
this
this
will
show
you
the
dream
of
our
kaiser
this
will
show
you
the
framework
of
the
empire
that
is
to
he
laid
out
a
map
upon
the
table
the
two
men
bent
over
it
it
was
a
map
of
europe
in
which
england
a
diminished
france
spain
portugal
and
italy
were
painted
in
dark
blue
for
the
rest
the
whole
of
the
space
included
between
two
lines
one
from
hamburg
to
athens
the
other
from
finland
to
the
black
sea
was
painted
a
deep
scarlet
with
here
and
there
portions
of
it
in
slightly
lighter
colouring
seaman
laid
his
palm
upon
the
map
there
lies
our
future
empire
he
said
solemnly
and
impressively
explain
it
to
me
dominey
begged
broadly
speaking
everything
between
those
two
lines
belongs
to
the
new
german
empire
poland
courland
lithuania
and
the
ukraine
will
possess
a
certain
degree
of
autonomous
government
which
will
practically
amount
to
nothing
asia
is
there
at
our
feet
no
longer
will
great
britain
control
the
supplies
of
the
world
raw
materials
of
every
description
will
be
ours
leather
tallow
wheat
oil
fats
timber
they
are
all
there
for
us
to
draw
upon
and
for
wealth
india
and
china
what
more
could
you
have
my
friend
you
take
my
breath
away
but
what
about
austria
seaman
grin
was
almost
sardonic
austria
he
said
must
already
feel
her
doom
creeping
upon
her
there
is
no
room
in
middle
europe
for
two
empires
and
the
house
of
hapsburg
must
fall
before
the
house
of
hohenzollern
austria
body
and
soul
must
become
part
of
the
german
empire
then
further
down
mark
you
roumania
must
become
a
vassal
state
or
be
conquered
bulgaria
is
already
ours
turkey
with
constantinople
is
pledged
greece
will
either
join
us
or
be
wiped
out
servia
will
be
blotted
from
the
map
probably
also
montenegro
these
countries
which
are
painted
in
fainter
red
like
turkey
bulgaria
and
greece
become
vassal
states
to
be
absorbed
one
by
one
as
opportunity
presents
dominey
finger
strayed
northward
belgium
he
observed
has
belgium
we
shall
occupy
and
enslave
seaman
replied
our
line
of
advance
into
france
lies
that
way
and
we
need
her
ports
to
dominate
the
thames
holland
and
the
scandinavian
countries
as
you
observe
are
left
in
the
lighter
shade
of
red
if
an
opportunity
occurs
holland
and
denmark
may
be
incited
to
take
the
field
against
us
if
they
do
so
it
means
absorption
if
they
remain
as
they
probably
will
scared
neutrals
they
will
none
the
less
be
our
vassal
states
when
the
last
gun
has
been
and
norway
and
sweden
seaman
looked
down
at
the
map
and
smiled
look
at
them
he
said
they
lie
at
our
mercy
norway
has
her
western
seaboard
and
there
might
always
be
the
question
of
british
aid
so
far
as
she
is
concerned
but
sweden
is
ours
body
and
soul
more
than
any
other
of
these
vassal
states
it
is
our
master
plan
to
bring
her
into
complete
subjection
we
need
her
lusty
manhood
the
finest
cannon
food
in
the
world
for
later
wars
if
indeed
such
a
thing
should
be
she
has
timber
and
minerals
which
we
also
need
but
there
it
is
enough
first
of
all
men
in
this
country
my
friend
you
von
ragastein
have
gazed
upon
this
picture
of
the
this
is
marvellously
conceived
dominey
muttered
but
what
of
russia
with
her
millions
how
is
it
that
we
propose
notwithstanding
her
countless
millions
of
men
to
help
ourselves
to
her
richest
provinces
to
drive
a
way
through
the
heart
of
her
empire
this
seaman
replied
is
where
genius
steps
in
russia
has
been
ripe
for
a
revolution
any
time
for
the
last
fifteen
years
we
have
secret
agents
now
in
every
city
and
country
place
and
throughout
the
army
we
shall
teach
russia
how
to
make
herself
a
free
dominey
shivered
a
little
with
an
almost
involuntary
repulsion
for
the
second
time
that
almost
grin
on
seaman
face
revolted
him
and
what
of
my
own
work
seaman
helped
himself
to
a
liqueur
he
was
as
a
rule
a
moderate
man
but
this
was
the
third
time
he
had
replenished
his
glass
since
his
hasty
meal
my
brain
is
weary
friend
he
admitted
passing
his
hand
over
his
forehead
i
have
a
great
fatigue
the
thoughts
jump
about
this
last
week
has
been
one
of
fierce
excitements
everything
almost
your
daily
life
has
been
planned
we
shall
go
over
it
within
a
day
or
so
meanwhile
remember
this
it
is
our
great
aim
to
keep
england
out
of
the
terniloff
is
right
then
after
all
dominey
exclaimed
seaman
laughed
scornfully
if
we
want
england
out
of
the
war
he
pointed
out
it
is
not
that
we
desire
her
friendship
it
is
that
we
may
crush
her
the
more
easily
when
calais
boulogne
and
havre
are
in
our
hands
that
will
be
in
three
months
time
then
perhaps
our
attitude
towards
england
may
change
a
little
now
i
dominey
folded
up
the
map
with
reluctance
his
companion
shook
his
head
it
was
curious
that
he
too
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
upon
the
same
day
addressed
his
host
differently
baron
von
ragastein
he
said
there
are
six
of
those
maps
in
existence
that
one
is
for
you
lock
it
away
and
guard
it
as
though
it
were
your
greatest
treasure
on
earth
but
when
you
are
alone
bring
it
out
and
study
it
it
shall
be
your
inspiration
it
shall
lighten
your
moments
of
depression
give
you
courage
when
you
are
in
danger
it
shall
fill
your
mind
with
pride
and
wonder
it
is
dominey
folded
it
carefully
up
crossed
the
room
unlocked
a
little
safe
and
deposited
it
therein
i
shall
guard
it
according
to
your
behest
as
my
greatest
treasure
he
assured
his
departing
guest
with
a
fervour
which
surprised
even
himself
chapter
xxvii
there
was
something
dramatic
in
the
most
lurid
sense
of
the
word
about
the
brief
telephone
message
which
dominey
received
not
so
many
hours
later
from
carlton
house
terrace
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
moving
through
the
streets
still
familiar
yet
already
curiously
changed
men
and
women
were
going
about
their
business
as
usual
but
an
air
of
stupefaction
was
everywhere
apparent
practically
every
loiterer
was
studying
a
newspaper
every
chance
acquaintance
had
stopped
to
confer
with
his
fellows
war
alternately
the
joke
and
bogey
of
the
conversationalist
stretched
her
grey
hands
over
the
sunlit
city
even
the
felt
a
thrill
of
apprehension
at
the
thought
of
the
horrors
that
were
to
come
in
a
day
or
two
all
this
was
to
be
changed
people
went
about
then
counting
the
russian
millions
the
steamroller
fetish
was
to
be
evolved
the
most
peaceful
stockbroker
or
shopkeeper
who
had
never
even
been
to
a
review
in
his
life
could
make
calculations
of
man
power
with
a
stump
of
pencil
on
the
back
of
an
old
envelope
which
would
convince
the
greatest
pessimist
that
germany
and
austria
were
outnumbered
by
at
least
three
to
one
but
on
this
particular
morning
people
were
too
stunned
for
calculations
the
incredible
had
happened
the
war
the
nightmare
of
the
nervous
the
derision
of
the
optimist
had
actually
materialised
the
years
of
peace
and
plenty
had
suddenly
come
to
an
end
black
tragedy
leaned
over
the
land
dominey
avoiding
acquaintances
as
far
as
possible
his
own
mind
in
a
curious
turmoil
passed
down
james
street
and
along
pall
mall
and
presented
himself
at
carlton
house
terrace
externally
the
great
white
building
with
its
rows
of
flower
boxes
showed
no
signs
of
undue
perturbation
inside
however
the
anteroom
was
crowded
with
callers
and
it
was
only
by
the
intervention
of
terniloff
private
secretary
who
was
awaiting
him
that
dominey
was
able
to
reach
the
inner
sanctum
where
the
ambassador
was
busy
dictating
letters
he
broke
off
immediately
his
visitor
was
announced
and
dismissed
every
one
including
his
secretaries
then
he
locked
the
door
von
ragastein
he
groaned
i
am
a
broken
man
dominey
grasped
his
hand
sympathetically
terniloff
seemed
to
have
aged
years
even
in
the
last
few
hours
i
sent
for
you
he
continued
to
say
farewell
to
say
farewell
and
make
a
confession
you
were
right
and
i
was
wrong
it
would
have
been
better
if
i
had
remained
and
played
the
country
farmer
on
my
estates
i
was
never
shrewd
enough
to
see
until
now
that
i
have
been
made
the
of
the
very
men
whose
policy
i
always
his
visitor
still
remained
silent
there
was
so
little
that
he
could
say
i
have
worked
for
peace
terniloff
went
on
believing
that
my
country
wanted
peace
i
have
worked
for
peace
with
honourable
men
who
were
just
as
anxious
as
i
was
to
secure
it
but
all
the
time
those
for
whom
i
laboured
were
making
faces
behind
my
back
i
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
their
tool
i
know
now
that
nothing
in
this
world
could
have
hindered
what
is
every
one
will
at
least
realise
dominey
reminded
him
that
you
did
your
best
for
that
is
one
reason
why
i
sent
for
you
was
the
agitated
reply
not
long
ago
i
spoke
of
a
little
volume
a
diary
which
i
have
been
keeping
of
my
work
in
this
country
i
promised
to
show
it
to
you
you
have
asked
me
for
it
several
times
lately
i
am
going
to
show
it
to
you
now
it
is
written
up
to
yesterday
it
will
tell
you
of
all
my
efforts
and
how
they
were
foiled
it
is
an
absolutely
faithful
narrative
of
my
work
here
and
the
english
response
to
the
prince
crossed
the
room
unlocked
one
of
the
smaller
safes
which
stood
against
the
side
of
the
wall
withdrew
a
volume
the
size
of
a
small
portfolio
and
returned
to
dominey
i
beg
you
he
said
earnestly
to
read
this
with
the
utmost
care
and
to
await
my
instructions
with
regard
to
it
you
can
judge
no
doubt
he
went
on
a
little
bitterly
why
i
give
it
into
your
keeping
even
the
embassy
here
is
not
free
from
our
own
spies
and
the
existence
of
these
memoirs
is
known
the
moment
i
reach
germany
their
fate
is
assured
i
am
a
german
and
a
patriot
although
my
heart
is
bitter
against
those
who
are
bringing
this
blot
upon
our
country
for
that
reason
these
memoirs
must
be
kept
in
a
safe
place
until
i
see
a
good
use
for
you
mean
if
the
governing
party
in
german
should
change
precisely
they
would
then
form
at
once
my
justification
and
place
english
diplomacy
in
such
a
light
before
the
saner
portion
of
my
fellow
countrymen
that
an
honourable
peace
might
be
rendered
possible
study
them
carefully
von
ragastein
perhaps
even
your
own
allegiance
to
the
party
you
serve
may
waver
for
a
moment
as
you
i
serve
no
party
dominey
said
quietly
only
my
terniloff
sighed
alas
there
is
no
time
for
us
to
enter
into
one
of
our
old
arguments
on
the
ethics
of
government
i
must
send
you
away
von
ragastein
you
have
a
terrible
task
before
you
i
am
bound
to
wish
you
godspeed
for
myself
i
shall
not
raise
my
head
again
until
i
have
left
there
is
no
other
commission
dominey
asked
no
other
way
in
which
i
can
serve
you
none
terniloff
answered
sadly
i
am
permitted
to
suffer
no
inconveniences
my
departure
is
arranged
for
as
though
i
were
royalty
yet
believe
me
my
friend
every
act
of
courtesy
and
generosity
which
i
receive
in
these
moments
bites
into
my
heart
farewell
dominey
found
a
taxicab
in
pall
mall
and
drove
back
to
berkeley
square
he
found
rosamund
with
a
little
troop
of
dogs
just
entering
the
gardens
and
crossed
to
her
side
dear
he
asked
taking
her
arm
would
you
mind
very
much
coming
down
to
norfolk
for
a
few
days
with
you
she
asked
quickly
yes
i
want
to
be
in
retreat
for
a
short
time
there
are
one
or
two
things
i
must
settle
before
i
take
up
some
fresh
i
should
love
it
she
declared
enthusiastically
london
is
getting
so
hot
and
every
one
is
so
i
shall
order
the
touring
car
at
three
dominey
told
her
we
shall
get
home
about
nine
parkins
and
your
maid
can
go
down
by
train
does
that
suit
you
delightfully
he
took
her
arm
and
they
paced
slowly
along
the
hot
walk
rosamund
dear
he
said
the
time
has
come
which
many
people
have
been
dreading
we
are
at
i
know
she
murmured
you
and
i
have
had
quite
a
happy
time
together
these
last
few
months
he
went
on
even
though
there
is
still
that
black
cloud
between
us
i
have
tried
to
treat
you
as
kindly
and
tenderly
as
though
i
were
really
your
husband
and
you
were
indeed
my
you
not
going
away
she
cried
startled
i
could
bear
that
no
one
could
ever
be
so
sweet
as
you
have
been
to
dear
he
said
i
want
you
to
think
of
your
husband
of
everard
he
was
a
soldier
once
for
a
short
time
was
he
not
what
do
you
think
he
would
have
done
now
that
this
terrible
war
has
come
he
would
have
done
what
you
will
do
she
answered
with
the
slightest
possible
tremor
in
her
tone
he
would
have
become
a
soldier
again
he
would
have
fought
for
his
and
so
must
i
fight
for
my
country
he
declared
that
is
why
i
must
leave
you
for
an
hour
now
while
i
make
some
calls
i
shall
be
back
to
luncheon
directly
afterwards
we
must
start
i
have
many
things
to
arrange
first
though
life
is
not
going
to
be
very
easy
for
the
next
few
she
held
on
to
his
arm
she
seemed
curiously
reluctant
to
let
him
go
everard
she
said
when
we
are
at
dominey
shall
i
be
able
to
see
doctor
harrison
of
course
he
assured
her
there
is
something
i
want
to
say
to
him
she
confided
something
i
want
to
ask
you
too
are
you
the
same
person
everard
when
you
are
in
town
as
when
you
are
in
the
country
he
was
a
little
taken
aback
at
her
question
asked
too
with
such
almost
plaintive
seriousness
the
very
aberration
it
suggested
seemed
altogether
denied
by
her
appearance
she
was
wearing
a
dress
of
black
and
white
muslin
a
large
black
hat
paris
shoes
her
stockings
her
gloves
all
the
trifling
details
of
her
toilette
were
carefully
chosen
and
her
clothes
themselves
gracefully
and
naturally
worn
socially
too
she
had
been
amazingly
successful
only
the
week
before
caroline
had
come
to
him
with
a
little
shrug
of
the
shoulders
i
have
been
trying
to
be
kind
to
rosamund
she
said
and
finding
out
instead
how
unnecessary
it
is
she
is
quite
the
most
popular
of
the
younger
married
women
in
our
set
you
do
deserve
such
luck
you
know
the
proverb
about
the
old
roue
he
had
replied
his
mind
had
wandered
for
a
moment
he
realised
rosamund
question
with
a
little
start
the
same
person
dear
he
repeated
i
think
so
do
i
seem
so
to
you
she
shook
her
head
i
am
not
sure
she
answered
a
little
mysteriously
you
see
in
the
country
i
still
remember
sometimes
that
awful
night
when
i
so
nearly
lost
my
reason
i
have
never
seen
you
as
you
looked
that
you
would
rather
not
go
back
perhaps
that
is
the
strange
part
of
it
she
replied
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
i
want
so
much
to
do
there
an
empty
taxi
dear
she
added
as
they
reached
the
gate
i
shall
go
in
and
tell
justine
about
the
chapter
xxviii
within
the
course
of
the
next
few
days
a
strange
rumour
spread
through
dominey
and
the
district
from
the
farm
labourer
to
the
farmer
from
the
school
children
to
their
homes
from
the
village
to
the
neighbouring
hamlets
a
gang
of
woodmen
from
a
neighbouring
county
with
an
engine
and
all
the
machinery
of
their
craft
had
started
to
work
razing
to
the
ground
everything
in
the
shape
of
tree
or
shrub
at
the
north
end
of
the
black
wood
the
matter
of
the
war
was
promptly
forgotten
before
the
second
day
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
place
had
paid
an
awed
visit
to
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
had
listened
to
the
whirr
of
machinery
had
gazed
upon
the
great
bridge
of
planks
leading
into
the
wood
had
peered
in
the
hope
of
some
strange
discovery
into
the
tents
of
the
men
who
were
camping
out
the
men
themselves
were
not
communicative
and
the
first
time
the
foreman
had
been
known
to
open
his
mouth
was
when
dominey
walked
down
to
discuss
progress
on
the
morning
after
his
arrival
it
a
dirty
bit
of
work
sir
he
confided
i
do
know
as
i
ever
came
across
a
bit
of
woodland
as
was
so
utterly
hopelessly
rotten
why
the
wood
crumbles
when
you
touch
it
and
the
men
have
to
be
within
reach
of
one
another
the
whole
of
the
time
though
we
a
matter
of
five
hundred
planks
down
come
across
anything
unusual
yet
we
ai
come
across
anything
that
is
unusual
so
far
sir
my
men
are
all
wearing
extra
leggings
to
keep
them
from
being
bitten
by
them
adders
as
long
as
my
arm
some
of
and
there
fungus
there
which
when
you
touch
it
sends
out
a
smell
enough
to
make
a
man
faint
we
killed
a
cat
the
first
day
as
big
and
as
fierce
as
a
young
tigress
it
a
queer
job
how
long
will
it
take
matter
of
three
weeks
sir
and
when
we
got
the
timber
out
you
be
well
advised
to
burn
it
it
not
worth
a
snap
of
the
begging
your
pardon
sir
the
man
went
on
the
old
lady
in
the
distance
there
hangs
about
the
whole
of
the
time
some
of
my
men
are
half
scared
of
dominey
swung
around
on
a
mound
a
little
distance
away
in
the
park
rachael
unthank
was
standing
in
her
rusty
black
clothes
unrelieved
by
any
trace
of
colour
her
white
cheeks
and
strange
eyes
even
in
the
morning
light
she
was
a
repellent
figure
dominey
strolled
across
to
her
you
see
unthank
he
began
she
interrupted
him
her
skinny
hand
was
stretched
out
towards
the
wood
what
are
those
men
doing
sir
everard
dominey
she
demanded
what
is
your
will
with
the
wood
i
am
carrying
out
a
determination
i
came
to
in
the
winter
dominey
replied
those
men
are
going
to
cut
and
hew
their
way
from
one
end
of
the
black
wood
to
the
other
until
not
a
tree
or
a
bush
remains
upright
as
they
cut
they
burn
afterwards
i
shall
have
it
drained
we
may
live
to
see
a
field
of
corn
there
you
will
dare
to
do
this
she
asked
hoarsely
will
you
dare
to
tell
me
why
i
should
not
unthank
she
relapsed
into
silence
and
dominey
passed
on
but
that
night
as
rosamund
and
he
were
lingering
over
their
dessert
enjoying
the
strange
quiet
and
the
wonderful
breeze
which
crept
in
at
the
open
window
parkins
announced
a
visitor
mrs
unthank
is
in
the
library
sir
he
announced
she
would
be
glad
if
you
could
spare
her
five
rosamund
shivered
slightly
but
nodded
as
dominey
glanced
towards
her
enquiringly
do
let
me
see
her
please
she
begged
you
must
go
of
everard
yes
dear
i
know
what
you
are
doing
out
there
although
you
have
never
said
a
word
to
me
about
it
she
continued
with
an
odd
little
note
of
passion
in
her
tone
do
let
her
persuade
you
to
stop
let
them
cut
and
burn
and
hew
till
there
is
room
for
a
mouse
to
hide
you
promise
i
promise
he
answered
unthank
was
making
every
effort
to
keep
under
control
her
fierce
discomposure
she
rose
as
dominey
entered
the
room
and
dropped
an
curtsey
well
unthank
he
enquired
what
can
i
do
for
you
it
about
the
wood
again
sir
she
confessed
i
ca
bear
it
all
night
long
i
seem
to
hear
those
axes
and
the
calling
of
the
what
is
your
objection
unthank
to
the
destruction
of
the
black
wood
dominey
asked
bluntly
it
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
noisome
its
very
presence
there
after
all
that
she
has
suffered
is
a
menace
to
lady
dominey
nerves
i
am
determined
to
sweep
it
from
the
face
of
the
the
forced
respect
was
already
beginning
to
disappear
from
her
manner
there
evil
will
come
to
you
if
you
do
sir
everard
she
declared
doggedly
plenty
of
evil
has
come
to
me
from
that
wood
as
it
is
he
reminded
her
you
mean
to
disturb
the
spirit
of
him
whose
body
you
threw
there
she
persisted
dominey
looked
at
her
calmly
some
sort
of
evil
seemed
to
have
lit
in
her
face
her
lips
had
shrunk
apart
showing
her
yellow
teeth
the
fire
in
her
narrowed
eyes
was
the
fire
of
hatred
i
am
no
murderer
unthank
he
said
your
son
stole
out
from
the
shadow
of
that
wood
attacked
me
in
a
cowardly
manner
and
we
fought
he
was
mad
when
he
attacked
me
he
fought
like
a
madman
and
notwithstanding
my
superior
strength
i
was
glad
to
get
away
alive
i
never
touched
his
body
it
lay
where
he
fell
if
he
crept
into
the
wood
and
died
there
then
his
death
was
not
at
my
door
he
sought
for
my
life
as
i
never
sought
for
you
done
him
wrong
the
woman
muttered
that
again
is
false
his
passion
for
lady
dominey
was
uninvited
and
unreciprocated
her
only
feeling
concerning
him
was
one
of
fear
that
the
whole
countryside
knows
your
son
was
a
lonely
a
morose
and
an
man
unthank
if
either
of
us
had
murder
in
our
hearts
it
was
he
not
i
and
as
for
you
dominey
went
on
after
a
pause
i
think
that
you
have
had
your
revenge
unthank
it
was
you
who
nursed
my
wife
into
insanity
it
was
you
who
fed
her
with
the
horror
of
your
son
spirit
i
think
that
if
i
had
stayed
away
another
two
years
lady
dominey
would
have
been
in
a
i
would
to
heaven
the
woman
cried
that
you
rotted
to
death
in
africa
you
carry
your
evil
feelings
far
unthank
he
replied
take
my
advice
give
up
this
foolish
idea
that
the
black
wood
is
still
the
home
of
your
son
spirit
go
and
live
on
your
annuity
in
another
part
of
the
country
and
he
moved
across
the
room
to
throw
open
a
window
her
eyes
followed
him
wonderingly
i
have
heard
a
rumour
she
said
slowly
there
has
been
a
word
spoken
here
and
there
about
you
i
had
my
doubts
sometimes
i
have
them
again
every
time
you
speak
are
you
really
everard
dominey
he
swung
around
and
faced
her
who
else
there
one
she
went
on
has
never
believed
it
and
that
her
ladyship
i
heard
strange
talk
from
the
people
who
come
under
your
masterful
ways
you
a
harder
man
than
the
everard
dominey
i
remember
what
if
you
should
be
an
impostor
you
have
only
to
prove
that
unthank
dominey
replied
and
a
portion
at
any
rate
of
the
black
wood
may
remain
standing
you
will
find
it
a
little
difficult
you
must
excuse
my
ringing
the
bell
i
see
no
object
in
asking
you
to
remain
she
rose
unwillingly
to
her
feet
her
manner
was
sullen
and
unyielding
you
are
asking
for
the
evil
things
she
warned
him
be
assured
dominey
answered
that
if
they
come
i
shall
know
how
to
deal
with
dominey
found
rosamund
and
doctor
harrison
who
had
walked
over
from
the
village
lingering
on
the
terrace
he
welcomed
the
latter
warmly
you
are
a
godsend
doctor
he
declared
i
have
been
obliged
to
leave
my
port
untasted
for
want
of
a
companion
you
will
excuse
us
for
a
moment
rosamund
she
nodded
pleasantly
and
the
doctor
followed
his
host
into
the
and
took
his
seat
at
the
table
where
the
dessert
still
remained
old
woman
threatening
mischief
the
latter
asked
with
a
keen
glance
from
under
his
shaggy
grey
eyebrows
i
think
she
means
it
dominey
replied
as
he
filled
his
guest
glass
personally
he
went
on
after
a
moment
pause
the
present
situation
is
beginning
to
confirm
an
old
suspicion
of
mine
i
am
a
hard
and
fast
materialist
you
know
doctor
in
certain
matters
and
i
have
not
the
slightest
faith
in
the
vindictive
mother
terrified
to
death
lest
the
razing
of
a
wood
of
unwholesome
character
should
turn
out
into
the
cold
world
the
spirit
of
her
angel
what
do
you
believe
the
doctor
asked
bluntly
i
would
rather
not
tell
you
at
the
present
moment
dominey
answered
it
would
sound
too
your
note
this
afternoon
spoke
of
urgency
the
doctor
observed
the
matter
is
urgent
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
great
favour
to
remain
here
all
you
are
expecting
something
to
happen
i
wish
at
any
rate
to
be
i
stay
with
pleasure
the
doctor
promised
you
can
lend
me
some
paraphernalia
i
suppose
and
give
me
a
somewhere
near
lady
dominey
he
began
and
hesitated
i
have
followed
your
advice
or
rather
your
orders
dominey
interrupted
a
little
harshly
it
has
not
always
been
easy
especially
in
london
where
rosamund
is
away
from
these
i
am
hoping
great
things
from
what
may
happen
or
very
the
doctor
nodded
sympathetically
i
should
wonder
if
you
were
on
the
right
track
he
declared
rosamund
came
in
through
the
window
to
them
and
seated
herself
by
dominey
side
why
are
you
two
whispering
like
conspirators
she
demanded
because
we
are
conspirators
he
replied
lightly
i
have
persuaded
doctor
harrison
to
stay
the
night
he
would
like
a
room
in
our
wing
will
you
let
the
maids
know
dear
she
nodded
thoughtfully
of
course
there
are
several
rooms
quite
ready
midgeley
thought
that
we
might
be
bringing
down
some
guests
i
am
quite
sure
that
we
can
make
doctor
harrison
no
doubt
about
that
lady
dominey
the
doctor
declared
let
me
be
as
near
to
your
apartment
as
there
was
a
shade
of
anxiety
in
her
face
you
think
that
something
will
happen
she
asked
or
one
night
very
soon
dominey
assented
it
is
just
as
well
for
you
to
be
prepared
you
will
not
be
afraid
dear
you
will
have
the
doctor
on
one
side
of
you
and
me
on
the
i
am
only
afraid
of
one
thing
she
answered
a
little
enigmatically
i
have
been
so
happy
dominey
changed
into
ordinary
morning
clothes
with
a
thick
cord
tied
round
his
body
a
revolver
in
his
pocket
and
a
loaded
stick
in
his
hand
spent
the
remainder
of
the
night
and
part
of
the
early
morning
concealed
behind
a
great
clump
of
rhododendrons
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
shadowy
stretch
of
park
which
lay
between
the
house
and
the
black
wood
the
night
was
moonless
but
clear
and
when
his
eyes
were
once
accustomed
to
the
pale
but
sombre
twilight
the
whole
landscape
and
the
moving
objects
upon
it
were
dimly
visible
the
habits
of
his
years
of
bush
life
seemed
instinctively
in
those
few
hours
of
waiting
to
have
reestablished
themselves
every
sense
was
strained
and
active
every
night
sound
of
which
the
hooting
of
some
owls
disturbed
from
their
lurking
place
in
the
black
wood
was
predominant
heard
and
accounted
for
and
then
just
as
he
had
glanced
at
his
watch
and
found
that
it
was
close
upon
two
came
the
first
real
intimation
that
something
was
likely
to
happen
moving
across
the
park
towards
him
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
faint
patter
curious
and
irregular
in
rhythm
which
came
from
behind
a
range
of
low
hillocks
he
raised
himself
on
his
hands
and
knees
to
watch
his
eyes
were
fastened
upon
a
certain
spot
a
stretch
of
the
open
park
between
himself
and
the
hillocks
the
patter
ceased
and
began
again
into
the
open
there
came
a
dark
shape
the
irregularity
of
its
movements
swiftly
explained
it
moved
at
first
upon
all
fours
then
on
two
legs
then
on
all
fours
again
it
crept
nearer
and
nearer
and
dominey
as
he
watched
laid
aside
his
stick
it
reached
the
terrace
paused
beneath
rosamund
window
now
barely
half
a
dozen
yards
from
where
he
was
crouching
deliberately
he
waited
waited
for
what
he
knew
must
soon
come
then
the
deep
silence
of
the
breathless
night
was
broken
by
that
familiar
unearthly
scream
dominey
waited
till
even
its
echoes
had
died
away
then
he
ran
a
few
steps
bent
double
and
stretched
out
his
hands
once
more
for
the
last
time
that
devil
cry
broke
the
deep
stillness
of
the
august
morning
throbbing
a
little
as
though
with
a
new
fear
dying
away
as
though
the
fingers
which
crushed
it
back
down
the
straining
throat
had
indeed
crushed
with
it
the
last
flicker
of
some
unholy
life
when
doctor
harrison
made
his
hurried
appearance
a
few
moments
later
he
found
dominey
seated
upon
the
terrace
furiously
smoking
a
cigarette
on
the
ground
a
few
yards
away
lay
something
black
and
motionless
what
is
it
the
doctor
gasped
for
the
first
time
dominey
showed
some
signs
of
a
lack
of
his
voice
was
choked
and
uneven
go
and
look
at
it
doctor
he
said
it
tied
up
hand
and
foot
you
can
see
where
the
spirit
of
roger
unthank
has
hidden
bosh
the
doctor
answered
with
grim
contempt
it
roger
unthank
himself
the
beast
a
little
stream
of
servants
came
running
out
dominey
gave
a
few
orders
quickly
ring
up
the
garage
he
directed
and
i
shall
want
one
of
the
men
to
go
into
norwich
to
the
hospital
doctor
will
you
go
up
and
see
lady
dominey
the
habits
of
a
lifetime
broke
down
parkins
the
immaculate
the
silent
the
perfect
automaton
asked
an
eager
question
what
is
it
sir
there
was
the
sound
of
a
window
opening
overhead
at
that
moment
parkins
would
not
have
asked
in
vain
for
an
annuity
dominey
glanced
at
the
little
semicircle
of
servants
and
raised
his
voice
it
is
the
end
i
trust
of
these
foolish
superstitions
about
roger
unthank
ghost
there
lies
roger
unthank
half
beast
half
man
for
some
reason
or
other
some
lunatic
reason
of
course
he
has
chosen
to
hide
himself
in
the
black
wood
all
these
years
his
mother
i
presume
has
been
his
accomplice
and
taken
him
food
he
is
still
alive
but
in
a
disgusting
there
was
a
little
awed
murmur
dominey
voice
had
become
quite
matter
of
fact
i
suppose
he
continued
his
first
idea
was
to
revenge
himself
upon
us
and
this
household
by
whom
he
imagined
himself
badly
treated
the
man
however
was
half
a
madman
when
he
came
to
the
neighbourhood
and
has
behaved
like
one
ever
johnson
dominey
continued
singling
out
a
sturdy
footman
with
sound
common
sense
get
ready
to
take
this
creature
into
norwich
hospital
say
that
if
i
do
not
come
in
during
the
day
a
letter
of
explanation
will
follow
from
me
the
rest
of
you
with
the
exception
of
parkins
please
go
to
with
little
exclamations
of
wonder
they
began
to
disperse
then
one
of
them
paused
and
pointed
across
the
park
moving
with
incredible
swiftness
came
the
gaunt
black
figure
of
rachael
unthank
swaying
sometimes
on
her
feet
yet
in
their
midst
before
they
could
realise
it
she
staggered
to
the
prostrate
body
and
threw
herself
upon
her
knees
her
hands
rested
upon
the
unseen
face
her
eyes
glared
across
at
dominey
so
you
got
him
at
last
she
gasped
mrs
unthank
dominey
said
sternly
you
are
in
time
to
accompany
your
son
to
the
hospital
at
norwich
the
car
will
be
here
in
two
minutes
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
your
own
conscience
should
be
sufficient
punishment
for
keeping
that
poor
creature
alive
in
such
a
fashion
and
ministering
during
my
absence
to
his
accursed
desire
for
he
would
have
died
if
i
had
brought
him
food
she
muttered
i
have
wept
all
the
tears
a
woman
broken
heart
could
wring
out
beseeching
him
to
come
back
to
yet
dominey
insisted
you
shared
his
foul
plot
for
vengeance
against
a
harmless
woman
you
let
him
come
and
make
his
ghoulish
noises
night
by
night
under
these
windows
without
a
word
of
remonstrance
you
knew
very
well
what
their
accursed
object
was
you
with
a
delicate
woman
in
your
charge
who
trusted
you
you
are
an
evil
pair
but
of
the
two
you
are
worse
than
your
the
woman
made
no
reply
she
was
still
on
her
knees
bending
over
the
prostrate
figure
from
whose
lips
now
came
a
faint
moaning
then
the
lights
of
the
car
flashed
out
as
it
left
the
garage
passed
through
the
iron
gates
and
drew
up
a
few
yards
away
help
him
in
dominey
ordered
you
can
loosen
his
cords
johnson
as
soon
as
you
have
started
he
has
very
little
strength
tell
them
at
the
hospital
i
shall
probably
be
there
during
the
day
or
with
a
little
shiver
the
two
men
stooped
to
their
task
their
prisoner
muttered
to
himself
all
the
time
but
made
no
resistance
rachael
unthank
as
she
stepped
in
to
take
her
place
by
his
side
turned
once
more
to
dominey
she
was
a
broken
woman
you
rid
of
us
she
sobbed
perhaps
you
said
harsh
things
of
both
of
us
roger
is
always
so
bad
sometimes
he
more
gentle
than
at
others
you
have
thought
then
that
he
was
just
a
baby
living
there
for
love
of
the
wind
and
the
trees
and
the
birds
if
he
comes
to
her
voice
broke
dominey
reply
was
swift
and
not
unkind
he
pointed
to
the
window
above
if
lady
dominey
recovers
you
and
your
son
are
forgiven
if
she
never
recovers
i
wish
you
both
the
blackest
corner
of
the
car
drove
off
doctor
harrison
met
dominey
on
the
threshold
as
he
turned
towards
the
house
her
ladyship
is
unconscious
now
he
announced
perhaps
that
is
a
good
sign
i
never
liked
that
unnatural
calm
she
be
unconscious
i
think
for
a
great
many
hours
for
god
sake
come
and
get
a
whisky
and
soda
and
give
me
one
the
early
morning
sunshine
lay
upon
the
park
when
the
two
men
at
last
separated
they
stood
for
a
moment
looking
out
from
the
black
wood
came
the
whirr
of
a
saw
the
little
troop
of
men
had
left
their
tents
the
crash
of
a
fallen
tree
heralded
their
morning
work
you
are
still
going
on
with
that
the
doctor
asked
to
the
very
last
stump
of
a
tree
to
the
last
bush
to
the
last
cluster
of
weeds
dominey
replied
with
a
sudden
passion
in
his
tone
i
will
have
that
place
razed
to
the
bare
level
of
the
earth
and
i
will
have
its
poisonous
swamps
sucked
dry
i
have
hated
that
foul
spot
he
went
on
ever
since
i
realised
what
suffering
it
meant
to
her
my
reign
here
may
not
be
long
doctor
i
have
my
own
tragedy
to
deal
with
but
those
who
come
after
me
will
never
feel
the
blight
of
that
accursed
the
doctor
grunted
his
inner
thoughts
he
kept
to
himself
maybe
you
right
he
conceded
chapter
xxix
the
heat
of
a
sulphurous
afternoon
a
curious
parallel
in
its
presage
of
coming
storm
to
the
crisis
in
dominey
own
affairs
had
driven
dominey
from
his
study
on
to
the
terrace
in
a
chair
by
his
side
lounged
eddy
pelham
immaculate
in
a
suit
of
white
flannels
it
was
the
fifth
day
since
the
mystery
of
the
black
wood
had
been
solved
ripping
old
chap
of
you
to
have
me
down
here
the
young
man
remarked
amiably
his
hand
stretching
out
to
a
tumbler
which
stood
by
his
side
the
country
when
you
can
get
ice
is
a
paradise
in
this
weather
especially
when
london
so
full
of
ghastly
rumours
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
what
the
latest
news
of
her
ladyship
still
unconscious
dominey
replied
the
doctors
however
seem
perfectly
satisfied
everything
depends
on
her
waking
the
young
man
abandoned
the
subject
with
a
murmur
of
hopeful
sympathy
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
a
little
cloud
of
dust
in
the
distance
expecting
visitors
he
asked
should
not
be
surprised
was
the
somewhat
laconic
answer
the
young
man
stood
up
yawned
and
stretched
himself
i
make
myself
scarce
he
said
jove
he
added
approvingly
lingering
for
a
moment
jolly
well
cut
the
tunic
of
your
uniform
dominey
if
a
country
in
peril
ever
decides
to
waive
the
matter
of
my
indifferent
physique
and
send
me
out
to
the
rescue
i
shall
go
to
your
dominey
smiled
mine
is
only
the
local
yeomanry
he
replied
they
will
nab
you
for
the
guards
dominey
stepped
back
through
the
open
windows
into
his
study
as
pelham
strolled
off
he
was
seated
at
his
desk
poring
over
some
letters
when
a
few
minutes
later
seaman
was
ushered
into
the
room
for
a
single
moment
his
muscles
tightened
his
frame
became
tense
then
he
realised
his
visitor
outstretched
hands
of
welcome
and
he
relaxed
seaman
was
perspiring
vociferous
and
excited
at
last
he
exclaimed
donner
und
my
god
dominey
what
is
this
thirteen
years
ago
dominey
explained
i
resigned
a
commission
in
the
norfolk
yeomanry
that
little
matter
however
has
been
adjusted
at
a
crisis
like
this
my
friend
you
are
wonderful
seaman
interrupted
solemnly
you
are
a
man
after
my
own
heart
you
are
thorough
you
leave
nothing
undone
that
is
why
he
added
lowering
his
voice
a
little
we
are
the
greatest
race
in
the
world
drink
before
everything
my
friend
he
went
on
drink
i
must
have
what
a
day
the
very
clouds
that
hide
the
sun
are
full
of
sulphurous
dominey
rang
the
bell
ordered
hock
and
seltzer
and
ice
seaman
drank
and
threw
himself
into
an
there
is
no
fear
of
your
being
called
out
of
the
country
because
of
that
i
hope
he
asked
a
little
anxiously
nodding
his
head
towards
his
companion
uniform
not
at
present
dominey
answered
i
am
a
trifle
over
age
to
go
with
the
first
batch
or
two
where
have
you
been
seaman
hitched
his
chair
a
little
nearer
in
ireland
he
confided
sorry
to
desert
you
as
i
did
but
you
do
not
begin
to
count
for
us
just
yet
there
was
just
a
faint
doubt
as
to
what
they
were
going
to
do
about
internment
that
is
why
i
had
to
get
the
irish
trip
off
my
what
has
been
decided
the
government
has
the
matter
under
consideration
seaman
replied
with
a
chuckle
i
can
certainly
give
myself
six
months
before
i
need
to
slip
off
now
tell
me
why
do
i
find
you
down
here
after
terniloff
left
dominey
explained
i
felt
i
wanted
to
get
away
i
have
been
asked
to
start
some
recruiting
work
down
terniloff
left
his
little
volume
with
you
yes
where
is
it
safe
dominey
replied
seaman
mopped
his
forehead
it
needs
to
be
he
muttered
i
have
orders
to
see
it
destroyed
we
can
talk
of
that
presently
sometimes
when
i
am
away
from
you
i
tremble
it
may
sound
foolish
but
you
have
in
your
possession
just
the
two
things
that
map
and
von
terniloff
memoirs
which
would
wreck
our
propaganda
in
every
country
of
the
both
are
safe
dominey
assured
him
by
the
by
my
friend
he
went
on
do
you
know
that
you
yourself
are
forgetting
your
usual
caution
in
what
respect
seaman
demanded
quickly
as
you
stooped
to
sit
down
just
now
i
distinctly
saw
the
shape
of
your
revolver
in
your
hip
pocket
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
with
your
name
and
the
fact
that
you
are
only
a
naturalised
englishman
it
is
inexcusably
foolish
to
be
carrying
firearms
about
just
seaman
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
threw
the
revolver
upon
the
table
you
are
quite
right
he
acknowledged
take
care
of
it
for
me
i
took
it
with
me
to
ireland
because
one
never
knows
what
may
happen
in
that
amazing
dominey
swept
it
carelessly
into
the
drawer
of
the
desk
at
which
he
was
sitting
our
weapons
from
now
on
seaman
continued
must
be
the
weapons
of
guile
and
craft
you
and
i
will
have
alas
to
see
less
of
one
another
dominey
in
many
ways
it
is
unfortunate
that
we
have
not
been
able
to
keep
england
out
of
this
for
a
few
more
months
however
the
situation
must
be
dealt
with
as
it
exists
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
you
have
practically
secured
yourself
against
suspicion
you
will
hold
a
brilliant
and
isolated
place
amongst
those
who
are
serving
the
great
war
lord
when
i
do
approach
you
it
will
be
for
sympathy
and
assistance
against
the
suspicions
of
those
englishmen
dominey
nodded
you
will
stay
the
night
he
asked
if
i
may
seaman
assented
it
is
the
last
time
for
many
months
when
it
will
be
wise
for
us
to
meet
on
such
intimate
terms
perhaps
our
dear
friend
parkins
will
take
vinous
note
of
the
in
other
words
dominey
said
you
propose
that
we
shall
drink
the
dominey
cabinet
hock
and
the
dominey
port
to
the
glory
of
our
to
the
glory
of
our
country
seaman
echoed
so
be
it
my
a
car
had
passed
along
the
avenue
in
front
of
the
house
there
was
the
sound
of
voices
in
the
hall
a
knock
at
the
door
the
rustle
of
a
woman
clothes
parkins
a
little
disturbed
announced
the
arrivals
the
princess
of
eiderstrom
and
a
gentleman
the
princess
said
that
her
errand
with
you
was
urgent
sir
he
added
turning
apologetically
towards
his
master
the
princess
was
already
in
the
room
and
following
her
a
short
man
in
a
suit
of
sombre
black
wearing
a
white
tie
and
carrying
a
black
bowler
hat
he
blinked
across
the
room
through
his
thick
glasses
and
dominey
knew
that
the
end
had
come
the
door
was
closed
behind
them
the
princess
came
a
little
further
into
the
room
her
hand
was
extended
towards
dominey
but
not
in
greeting
her
white
finger
pointed
straight
at
him
she
turned
to
her
companion
which
is
that
doctor
schmidt
she
demanded
the
englishman
by
god
schmidt
answered
the
silence
which
reigned
for
several
seconds
was
intense
and
profound
the
coolest
of
all
four
was
perhaps
dominey
the
princess
was
pale
with
a
passion
which
seemed
to
sob
behind
her
words
everard
dominey
she
cried
what
have
you
done
with
my
lover
what
have
you
done
with
leopold
von
ragastein
he
met
with
the
fate
dominey
replied
which
he
had
prepared
for
me
we
fought
and
i
you
killed
him
i
killed
him
dominey
echoed
it
was
a
matter
of
necessity
his
body
sleeps
on
the
bed
of
the
blue
and
your
life
here
has
been
a
lie
on
the
contrary
it
has
been
the
truth
dominey
objected
i
assured
you
at
the
carlton
when
you
first
spoke
to
me
and
i
have
assured
you
a
dozen
times
since
that
i
was
everard
dominey
that
is
my
name
that
is
who
i
seaman
voice
seemed
to
come
from
a
long
way
off
for
the
moment
the
man
had
neither
courage
nor
initiative
he
seemed
as
though
he
had
received
some
sort
of
stroke
his
mind
was
travelling
backwards
you
came
to
me
at
cape
town
he
muttered
you
had
all
von
letters
you
knew
his
history
you
had
the
imperial
von
ragastein
and
i
exchanged
the
most
intimate
confidences
in
his
camp
dominey
said
as
doctor
schmidt
there
knows
i
told
him
my
history
and
he
told
me
his
the
letters
and
papers
i
took
from
schmidt
had
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
for
a
moment
his
shoulders
were
heaving
my
beloved
chief
he
sobbed
my
dear
devoted
master
killed
by
that
drunken
englishman
not
so
drunk
as
you
fancied
him
dominey
said
coolly
not
so
far
gone
in
his
course
of
dissipation
but
that
he
was
able
to
pull
himself
up
when
the
great
incentive
the
princess
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
two
men
seaman
had
still
the
appearance
of
a
man
struggling
to
extricate
himself
from
some
sort
of
nightmare
my
first
and
only
suspicion
he
faltered
was
that
night
when
wolff
disappeared
wolff
coming
was
rather
a
tragedy
dominey
admitted
fortunately
i
had
a
secret
service
man
in
the
house
who
was
able
to
dispose
of
it
was
you
who
planned
his
disappearance
seaman
gasped
naturally
dominey
replied
he
knew
the
truth
and
was
trying
all
the
time
to
communicate
with
and
the
money
seaman
continued
blinking
rapidly
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
and
more
i
understood
that
was
a
gift
dominey
replied
if
the
german
secret
service
however
cares
to
formulate
a
claim
and
sue
me
the
princess
suddenly
interrupted
her
eyes
seemed
on
fire
what
are
you
you
two
she
cried
stretching
out
her
hands
towards
schmidt
and
seaman
are
you
lumps
of
earth
clods
creatures
without
courage
and
intelligence
you
can
let
him
stand
there
the
englishman
who
has
murdered
my
lover
who
has
befooled
you
you
let
him
stand
there
and
mock
you
and
you
do
and
say
nothing
is
his
life
a
sacred
thing
has
he
none
of
your
secrets
in
his
charge
the
great
god
above
us
seaman
groaned
with
a
sudden
white
horror
in
his
face
he
has
the
prince
memoirs
he
has
the
kaiser
map
on
the
contrary
dominey
replied
both
are
deposited
at
the
foreign
office
we
hope
to
find
them
very
useful
a
little
later
seaman
sprang
forward
like
a
tiger
and
went
down
in
a
heap
as
he
almost
threw
himself
upon
dominey
fist
schmidt
came
stealing
across
the
room
and
from
underneath
his
cuff
something
gleamed
you
are
two
to
one
the
princess
cried
passionately
as
both
assailants
hesitated
i
would
to
god
that
i
had
a
weapon
or
that
i
were
a
man
my
dear
princess
a
voice
remarked
from
the
window
four
to
two
the
other
way
i
think
what
eddy
pelham
his
hands
in
his
pockets
but
a
very
alert
gleam
in
his
usually
vacuous
face
stood
in
the
windowed
doorway
from
behind
him
two
exceedingly
men
slipped
into
the
room
there
was
no
fight
not
even
a
struggle
seaman
who
had
never
recovered
from
the
shock
of
his
surprise
and
was
now
completely
unnerved
was
handcuffed
in
a
moment
and
schmidt
disarmed
the
latter
was
the
first
to
break
the
curious
silence
what
have
i
done
he
demanded
why
am
i
treated
like
this
doctor
schmidt
eddy
asked
pleasantly
that
is
my
name
sir
was
the
fierce
reply
i
have
just
landed
from
east
africa
we
knew
nothing
of
the
war
when
we
started
i
came
to
expose
that
man
he
is
an
impostor
a
murderer
he
has
killed
a
german
he
has
committed
seaman
gasped
he
has
deceived
the
kaiser
he
has
dared
to
sit
in
his
presence
as
the
baron
von
ragastein
the
young
man
in
flannels
glanced
across
at
dominey
and
smiled
i
say
you
two
do
mean
to
be
funny
but
you
are
he
declared
first
of
all
there
doctor
schmidt
accuses
sir
everard
here
of
being
an
impostor
because
he
assumed
his
own
name
accuses
him
of
murdering
a
man
who
had
planned
in
cold
blood
you
were
in
that
by
the
by
schmidt
to
kill
him
and
then
there
our
friend
here
the
secretary
of
the
society
for
propagating
better
relations
between
the
business
men
of
england
and
germany
complaining
because
sir
everard
carried
through
in
germany
for
england
exactly
what
he
believed
the
baron
von
ragastein
was
carrying
out
here
for
germany
you
a
curious
race
you
i
demand
again
schmidt
shouted
to
know
by
what
right
i
am
treated
as
a
criminal
because
you
are
one
eddy
answered
coolly
you
and
von
ragastein
together
planned
the
murder
of
sir
everard
dominey
in
east
africa
and
i
caught
you
creeping
across
the
floor
just
now
with
a
knife
in
your
hand
that
do
for
you
any
questions
to
ask
seaman
none
was
the
surly
reply
you
are
the
young
man
remarked
coolly
within
the
last
two
days
your
house
in
forest
hill
and
your
offices
in
london
wall
have
been
you
have
said
enough
seaman
declared
fate
has
gone
against
me
i
thank
god
that
our
master
has
abler
servants
than
i
and
the
strength
to
crush
this
island
of
popinjays
and
fools
popinjays
seems
severe
eddy
murmured
in
a
hard
tone
however
to
get
on
with
this
little
matter
he
added
turning
to
one
of
his
two
subordinates
you
will
find
a
military
car
outside
take
these
men
over
to
the
guardroom
at
the
norwich
barracks
i
have
arranged
for
an
escort
to
see
them
to
town
tell
the
colonel
i
be
over
later
in
the
the
princess
rose
from
the
chair
into
which
she
had
subsided
a
few
moments
before
dominey
turned
towards
her
princess
he
said
there
can
be
little
conversation
between
us
yet
i
shall
ask
you
to
remember
this
von
ragastein
planned
my
death
in
cold
blood
i
could
have
slain
him
as
an
assassin
without
the
slightest
risk
but
i
preferred
to
meet
him
face
to
face
with
the
truth
upon
my
lips
it
was
his
life
or
mine
i
fought
for
my
country
sake
as
he
did
for
the
princess
looked
at
him
with
glittering
eyes
i
shall
hate
you
to
the
end
of
my
days
she
declared
because
you
have
killed
the
thing
i
love
but
although
i
am
a
woman
i
know
justice
you
were
chivalrous
towards
me
you
treated
leopold
perhaps
better
than
he
would
have
treated
you
i
pray
that
i
shall
never
see
your
face
again
be
so
good
as
to
suffer
me
to
leave
this
house
at
once
and
dominey
threw
open
the
windows
which
led
on
to
the
terrace
and
stood
on
one
side
she
passed
by
without
a
glance
at
him
and
disappeared
eddy
came
strolling
along
the
terrace
a
few
moments
later
nice
old
ducks
those
two
dear
heart
he
confided
seaman
has
just
offered
forsyth
my
burly
ruffian
in
the
blue
serge
suit
a
hundred
pounds
to
shoot
him
on
the
pretence
that
he
was
and
what
about
schmidt
insisted
on
his
rights
as
an
officer
and
demanded
the
front
seat
and
a
cigar
before
the
car
started
a
pretty
job
dominey
and
neatly
cleaned
dominey
was
watching
the
dust
from
the
two
cars
which
were
disappearing
down
the
avenue
tell
me
eddy
he
asked
there
one
thing
i
have
always
been
curious
about
how
did
you
manage
to
keep
that
fellow
wolff
when
there
was
a
war
on
and
he
was
breaking
the
law
the
young
man
grinned
we
had
to
stretch
a
point
there
old
dear
he
admitted
plans
of
a
fortress
eh
do
you
mean
to
say
that
he
had
plans
of
a
fortress
upon
him
dominey
asked
picture
of
norwich
castle
the
young
man
confided
but
keep
it
dark
can
i
have
a
drink
before
i
get
the
little
car
going
the
turmoil
of
the
day
was
over
and
dominey
after
one
silent
but
passionate
outburst
of
thankfulness
at
the
passing
from
his
life
of
this
unnatural
restraint
found
all
his
thoughts
absorbed
by
the
struggle
which
was
being
fought
out
in
the
bedchamber
above
the
old
doctor
came
down
and
joined
him
at
dinner
time
he
met
dominey
eager
glance
with
a
little
nod
she
doing
all
right
he
declared
no
fever
or
anything
bless
you
no
she
as
near
as
possible
in
perfect
health
physically
a
different
woman
from
what
she
was
this
time
last
year
i
can
tell
you
when
she
wakes
up
she
either
be
herself
again
without
a
single
illusion
of
any
sort
or
the
doctor
paused
sipped
his
wine
emptied
his
glass
and
set
it
down
approvingly
or
dominey
insisted
or
that
part
of
her
brain
will
be
more
or
less
permanently
affected
however
i
am
hoping
for
the
best
thank
heavens
you
on
the
spot
they
finished
their
dinner
almost
in
silence
afterwards
they
smoked
for
a
few
minutes
upon
the
terrace
then
they
made
their
way
softly
upstairs
the
doctor
parted
with
dominey
at
the
door
of
the
room
i
shall
remain
with
her
for
an
hour
or
so
he
said
after
that
i
shall
leave
her
entirely
to
herself
you
be
here
in
case
there
a
change
i
shall
be
here
dominey
promised
the
minutes
passed
into
hours
uncounted
unnoticed
dominey
sat
in
his
stirred
by
a
tumultuous
wave
of
passionate
emotion
the
memory
of
those
earlier
days
of
his
return
came
back
to
him
with
all
their
poignant
longings
he
felt
again
the
same
tearing
at
the
the
same
strange
unnerving
tenderness
the
great
drama
in
which
he
knew
that
he
too
would
surely
continue
to
play
his
part
seemed
like
a
thing
far
off
the
concern
of
another
race
of
men
every
fibre
of
his
being
seemed
attuned
to
the
magic
and
the
music
of
one
wild
hope
yet
when
there
came
what
he
had
listened
for
so
long
the
hope
seemed
frozen
into
fear
he
sat
a
little
forward
in
his
his
hands
gripping
its
sides
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
slowly
widening
crack
in
the
panel
it
was
as
it
had
been
before
she
stooped
low
stood
up
again
and
came
towards
him
from
behind
an
unseen
hand
closed
the
panel
she
came
to
him
with
her
arms
outstretched
and
all
the
wonderful
things
of
life
and
love
in
her
shining
eyes
that
faint
touch
of
the
somnambulist
had
passed
she
came
to
him
as
she
had
never
come
before
she
was
a
very
real
and
a
very
live
woman
everard
she
cried
he
took
her
into
his
arms
at
their
first
kiss
she
thrilled
from
head
to
foot
for
a
moment
she
laid
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
oh
i
have
been
so
silly
she
confessed
there
were
times
when
i
could
believe
that
you
were
my
everard
mine
and
now
i
her
lips
sought
his
again
his
parched
with
the
desire
of
years
along
the
corridor
the
old
doctor
tiptoed
his
way
to
his
room
with
a
pleased
smile
upon
his
face
