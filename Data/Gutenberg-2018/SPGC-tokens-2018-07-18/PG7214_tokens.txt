hamsun
from
hunger
to
harvest
between
hunger
and
growth
of
the
soil
lies
the
time
generally
allotted
to
a
generation
but
at
first
glance
the
two
books
seem
much
farther
apart
one
expresses
the
passionate
revolt
of
a
homeless
wanderer
against
the
conventional
routine
of
modern
life
the
other
celebrates
a
existence
bounded
in
every
direction
by
monotonous
chores
the
issuance
of
two
such
books
from
the
same
pen
suggests
to
the
superficial
view
a
complete
reversal
of
position
the
truth
however
is
that
hamsun
stands
today
where
he
has
always
stood
his
objective
is
the
same
if
he
has
changed
it
is
only
in
the
intensity
of
his
feeling
and
the
mode
of
his
attack
what
above
all
he
hates
and
combats
is
the
artificial
uselessness
of
existence
which
to
him
has
become
embodied
in
the
life
of
the
city
as
opposed
to
that
of
the
country
problems
do
not
enter
into
the
novels
of
hamsun
in
the
same
manner
as
they
did
into
the
plays
of
ibsen
hamsun
would
seem
to
take
life
as
it
is
not
with
any
pretense
at
its
complete
acceptability
but
without
hope
or
avowed
intention
of
making
it
over
if
his
tolerance
be
never
free
from
satire
his
satire
is
on
the
other
hand
always
easily
tolerant
one
might
almost
suspect
him
of
viewing
life
as
something
static
against
which
all
fight
would
be
futile
even
life
worst
brutalities
are
related
with
an
offhandedness
of
manner
that
makes
you
look
for
the
joke
that
must
be
at
the
bottom
of
them
the
word
would
seem
to
be
strangely
eliminated
from
his
dictionary
or
if
present
it
might
be
found
defined
as
a
humorous
conception
of
something
intrinsically
unachievable
hamsun
would
not
be
the
artist
he
is
if
he
were
less
deceptive
he
has
his
problems
no
less
than
ibsen
had
and
he
is
much
preoccupied
with
them
even
when
he
appears
lost
in
ribald
laughter
they
are
different
from
ibsen
however
and
in
that
difference
lies
one
of
the
chief
explanations
of
hamsun
position
as
an
artist
all
of
ibsen
problems
became
in
the
last
instance
reducible
to
a
single
relationship
that
between
the
individual
and
his
own
self
to
be
himself
was
his
cry
and
his
task
with
this
consummation
in
view
he
plumbed
every
depth
of
human
nature
this
one
thing
achieved
all
else
became
insignificant
hamsun
begins
where
ibsen
ended
one
might
say
the
one
problem
never
consciously
raised
by
him
as
a
problem
is
that
of
man
duty
or
ability
to
express
his
own
nature
that
is
taken
for
granted
the
figures
populating
the
works
of
hamsun
whether
centrally
placed
or
moving
shadowlike
in
the
periphery
are
first
of
all
themselves
agressively
inevitably
unconsciously
so
in
other
words
they
are
like
their
creator
they
may
perish
tragically
or
ridiculously
as
a
result
of
their
common
inability
to
lay
violent
hand
on
their
own
natures
they
may
go
through
life
warped
and
dwarfed
for
lack
of
an
adjustment
that
to
most
of
us
might
seem
both
easy
and
natural
their
own
selves
may
become
more
clearly
revealed
to
them
by
harsh
or
happy
contacts
with
life
and
they
may
change
their
surfaces
accordingly
the
one
thing
never
occurring
to
them
is
that
they
might
for
the
sake
of
something
or
some
one
outside
of
themselves
be
anything
but
what
they
are
there
are
interferences
however
and
it
is
from
these
that
problems
spring
a
man
may
prosper
or
suffer
by
being
himself
and
in
neither
case
is
the
fault
his
own
there
are
factors
that
more
or
less
fatally
influence
and
circumscribe
the
supremely
important
factor
that
is
his
own
self
roughly
these
fall
into
three
groups
suggestive
of
three
classes
of
relationships
between
man
and
his
general
environment
between
man
and
that
force
of
life
which
we
call
love
and
between
man
and
life
in
its
entirety
as
an
omnipotence
that
some
of
us
call
god
and
others
leave
unnamed
deceptive
preference
for
indirectness
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
while
he
tries
to
make
us
believe
that
his
work
is
chiefly
preoccupied
with
problems
of
the
second
class
his
mind
is
really
busy
with
those
of
the
first
class
the
explanation
is
simple
nothing
helps
like
love
to
bring
out
the
unique
qualities
of
a
man
nature
on
the
other
hand
there
is
nothing
that
does
more
to
prevent
a
man
from
being
himself
than
the
ruts
of
habit
into
which
his
environment
always
tends
to
drive
him
there
are
two
kinds
of
environment
natural
and
human
hamsun
appears
to
think
that
the
less
you
have
of
one
and
the
more
of
the
other
the
better
for
yourself
and
for
humanity
as
a
whole
the
city
to
him
is
primarily
concentrated
human
environment
and
as
such
bad
this
phase
of
his
attitude
toward
life
almost
amounts
to
a
phobia
it
must
be
connected
with
personal
experiences
of
unusual
depth
and
intensity
perhaps
it
offers
a
key
that
may
be
well
worth
searching
for
hamsun
was
born
in
the
country
of
and
among
peasants
in
such
surroundings
he
grew
up
the
removal
of
his
parents
from
the
central
inland
part
of
norway
to
the
rocky
northern
coast
meant
a
change
of
natural
setting
but
not
a
human
contact
the
sea
must
have
come
into
his
life
as
a
revelation
and
yet
it
plays
an
astonishingly
small
part
in
his
work
it
is
always
present
but
always
in
the
distance
you
hear
of
it
but
you
are
never
taken
to
it
at
about
fifteen
hamsun
had
an
experience
which
is
rarely
mentioned
as
part
of
the
scant
biographical
material
made
available
by
his
reserve
concerning
his
own
personality
he
returned
to
the
old
home
of
his
parents
in
the
gudbrand
valley
and
worked
for
a
few
months
as
clerk
in
a
country
store
a
store
just
like
any
one
of
those
that
figure
so
conspicuously
in
almost
every
one
of
his
novels
the
place
and
the
work
must
have
made
a
revolutionary
impression
on
him
it
apparently
aroused
longings
and
it
probably
laid
the
basis
for
resistances
and
resentments
that
later
blossomed
into
weedlike
abundance
as
he
came
in
contact
with
real
city
life
there
runs
through
his
work
a
strange
sense
of
sympathy
for
the
little
store
on
the
border
of
the
wilderness
but
it
is
also
stamped
as
the
forerunner
and
panderer
of
the
lures
of
the
city
as
a
boy
of
eighteen
when
working
in
a
tiny
coast
town
as
a
apprentice
he
ventured
upon
his
first
literary
endeavors
and
actually
managed
to
get
two
volumes
printed
at
his
own
cost
the
art
of
writing
was
in
his
blood
exercising
a
call
and
a
command
that
must
have
been
felt
as
a
pain
at
times
and
as
a
consecration
at
other
times
books
and
writing
were
connected
with
the
city
perhaps
the
hatred
that
later
days
developed
had
its
roots
in
a
thwarted
passion
even
in
the
little
community
where
his
first
scribblings
reached
print
he
must
have
felt
himself
in
urban
surroundings
and
perhaps
those
first
crude
volumes
drew
upon
him
laughter
and
scorn
that
his
sensitive
soul
never
forgot
if
something
of
the
kind
happened
the
seed
thus
sown
was
nourished
plentifully
afterwards
when
as
a
young
man
hamsun
pitted
his
ambitions
against
the
indifference
first
of
christiania
and
then
of
chicago
the
result
was
a
defeat
that
seemed
the
more
bitter
because
it
looked
like
punishment
incurred
by
straying
after
false
gods
others
have
suffered
in
the
same
way
although
being
less
rigidly
themselves
they
may
not
like
hamsun
have
taken
a
perverse
pleasure
in
driving
home
the
point
of
the
agony
others
have
thought
and
said
harsh
things
of
the
cities
but
no
one
that
i
can
recall
has
equalled
hamsun
in
his
merciless
denunciation
of
the
very
principle
of
urbanity
the
truth
of
it
seems
to
be
that
hamsun
pilgrimage
to
the
bee
hives
where
modern
humanity
clusters
typically
was
an
essential
violation
of
something
within
himself
that
mattered
even
more
than
his
literary
ambition
to
his
soul
integrity
perhaps
if
i
am
right
he
is
the
first
genuine
peasant
who
has
risen
to
such
artistic
mastery
reaching
its
ultimate
heights
through
a
belated
recognition
of
his
own
proper
settings
hamsun
was
sixty
when
he
wrote
growth
of
the
it
is
the
first
work
in
which
he
celebrates
the
life
of
the
open
country
for
its
own
sake
and
not
merely
as
a
contrast
to
the
artificiality
and
selfishness
of
the
cities
it
was
written
too
after
he
had
definitely
withdrawn
himself
from
the
gathering
places
of
the
writers
and
the
artists
to
give
an
equal
share
of
his
time
and
attention
to
the
tilling
of
the
soil
that
was
at
last
his
own
it
is
the
harvest
of
his
ultimate
the
various
phases
of
his
campaign
against
city
life
are
also
interesting
and
illuminating
early
in
his
career
as
a
writer
he
tried
an
open
attack
in
full
force
by
a
couple
of
novels
shallow
soil
and
editor
lynge
dealing
sarcastically
with
the
literary
bohemia
of
the
norwegian
capital
they
were
on
the
whole
failures
artistically
rather
than
commercially
they
are
among
his
poorest
books
the
attack
was
never
repeated
in
that
form
he
retired
to
the
country
so
to
speak
and
tried
from
there
to
strike
at
what
he
could
reach
of
the
ever
expanding
ever
devouring
city
after
that
the
city
like
the
sea
is
always
found
in
the
distance
one
feels
it
without
ever
seeing
it
there
is
fear
as
well
as
hatred
in
his
treatment
of
it
in
the
country
it
is
represented
not
so
much
by
the
store
which
after
all
fills
an
unmistakable
need
on
the
part
of
the
rural
population
as
by
the
representatives
of
the
various
professions
for
these
hamsun
entertains
a
hostile
feeling
hardly
less
marked
than
that
bestowed
on
their
place
of
origin
whither
to
his
openly
declared
disgust
they
are
always
longing
it
does
not
matter
whether
they
are
ministers
or
actors
lawyers
or
doctors
they
are
all
tarred
with
the
same
brush
their
common
characteristic
is
their
rootlessness
they
have
no
real
home
because
to
hamsun
a
home
is
unthinkable
apart
from
a
space
of
soil
possessed
in
continuity
by
successive
generations
they
are
always
despising
the
surroundings
in
which
they
find
themselves
temporarily
and
their
chief
claim
to
distinction
is
a
genuine
or
pretended
knowledge
of
life
on
a
large
scale
greatness
is
to
them
inseparably
connected
with
crowdedness
and
what
they
call
sophistication
is
at
bottom
nothing
but
a
wallowing
in
that
herd
instinct
which
takes
the
place
of
ancient
antagonist
in
hamsun
books
above
all
their
standards
of
judgment
are
not
their
own
from
what
has
just
been
said
one
might
conclude
that
the
spirit
of
hamsun
is
fundamentally
unsocial
so
it
is
in
a
way
but
only
in
so
far
as
we
have
come
to
think
of
social
and
urban
as
more
or
less
interchangeable
terms
he
has
a
social
consciousness
and
a
social
passion
of
his
own
but
it
is
decentralized
one
might
say
he
knows
of
no
greater
man
than
his
own
isak
of
growth
of
the
soil
a
simple
pioneer
in
whose
wake
new
homes
spring
up
an
inarticulate
and
uncouth
personification
of
man
mastery
of
nature
when
hamsun
speaks
of
isak
passing
across
the
yearning
fields
with
the
grain
flung
in
fructifying
waves
from
his
reverent
hands
he
pictures
it
deliberately
in
the
light
of
a
religious
rite
the
oldest
and
most
significant
known
to
man
it
is
as
if
the
man
who
starved
in
christiania
and
the
western
cities
of
the
united
states
not
figuratively
but
literally
had
once
for
all
conceived
a
respect
for
man
principal
food
that
has
colored
all
subsequent
life
for
him
and
determined
his
own
attitude
toward
everything
by
a
reference
to
its
connection
or
lack
of
connection
with
that
substance
taking
it
all
in
all
one
may
well
call
hamsun
the
virtues
winning
his
praise
and
the
conditions
that
stir
his
longings
are
not
of
the
present
day
there
is
in
him
something
primitive
that
forms
a
sharp
contrast
to
the
modernity
of
his
own
style
even
in
his
most
romantic
exaggerations
as
in
hunger
and
mysteries
he
is
a
realist
dealing
unrelentingly
with
life
as
it
appears
to
us
it
would
hardly
be
too
much
to
call
his
method
scientific
but
he
uses
it
to
aim
tremendous
explosive
charges
at
those
human
concentrations
that
made
possible
the
forging
of
the
weapons
he
wields
so
skilfully
nor
does
he
stop
at
a
wish
to
see
those
concentrations
scattered
the
very
ambitions
and
utopias
bred
within
them
are
anathema
to
his
soul
that
places
simplicity
above
cleanliness
in
divine
proximity
characteristically
we
find
that
the
one
art
treated
with
constant
sympathy
in
his
writings
is
that
of
music
which
probably
is
the
earliest
and
certainly
the
one
least
dependent
on
the
herding
of
men
in
barracks
in
place
of
what
he
wishes
to
take
away
he
offers
nothing
but
peace
and
the
sense
of
genuine
creation
that
comes
to
the
man
who
has
just
garnered
the
harvests
of
his
own
fields
into
his
bulging
barns
he
is
a
prophet
of
plenty
but
he
has
no
answer
ready
when
we
ask
him
what
we
are
going
to
do
with
it
after
we
have
got
it
like
a
true
son
of
the
brooding
north
he
wishes
to
set
us
thinking
but
he
has
no
final
solutions
to
offer
edwin

pan
i
these
last
few
days
i
have
been
thinking
and
thinking
of
the
nordland
summer
with
its
endless
day
sitting
here
thinking
of
that
and
of
a
hut
i
lived
in
and
of
the
woods
behind
the
hut
and
writing
things
down
by
way
of
passing
the
time
to
amuse
myself
no
more
the
time
goes
very
slowly
i
can
not
get
it
to
pass
as
quickly
as
i
would
though
i
have
nothing
to
sorrow
for
and
live
as
pleasantly
as
could
be
i
am
well
content
withal
and
my
thirty
years
are
no
age
to
speak
of
a
few
days
back
someone
sent
me
two
feathers
two
bird
feathers
in
a
sheet
of
with
a
coronet
and
fastened
with
a
seal
sent
from
a
place
a
long
way
off
from
one
who
need
not
have
sent
them
back
at
all
that
amused
me
too
those
devilish
green
feathers
and
for
the
rest
i
have
no
troubles
unless
for
a
touch
of
gout
now
and
again
in
my
left
foot
from
an
old
healed
long
since
two
years
ago
i
remember
the
time
passed
quickly
beyond
all
comparison
more
quickly
than
time
now
a
summer
was
gone
before
i
knew
two
years
ago
it
was
in
i
will
write
of
it
just
to
amuse
myself
of
something
that
happened
to
me
or
something
i
dreamed
now
i
have
forgotten
many
things
belonging
to
that
time
by
having
scarcely
thought
of
them
since
but
i
remember
that
the
nights
were
very
light
and
many
things
seemed
curious
and
unnatural
twelve
months
to
the
year
but
night
was
like
day
and
never
a
star
to
be
seen
in
the
sky
and
the
people
i
met
were
strange
and
of
a
different
nature
from
those
i
had
known
before
sometimes
a
single
night
was
enough
to
make
them
blossom
out
from
childhood
into
the
full
of
their
glory
ripe
and
fully
grown
no
witchery
in
this
only
i
had
never
seen
the
like
before
no
in
a
white
roomy
home
down
by
the
sea
i
met
with
one
who
busied
my
thoughts
for
a
little
time
i
do
not
always
think
of
her
now
not
any
more
no
i
have
forgotten
her
but
i
think
of
all
the
other
things
the
cry
of
the
my
hunting
in
the
woods
my
nights
and
all
the
warm
hours
of
that
summer
after
all
it
was
only
by
the
merest
accident
i
happened
to
meet
her
save
for
that
she
would
never
have
been
in
my
thoughts
for
a
day
from
the
hut
where
i
lived
i
could
see
a
confusion
of
rocks
and
reefs
and
islets
and
a
little
of
the
sea
and
a
bluish
mountain
peak
or
so
behind
the
hut
was
the
forest
a
huge
forest
it
was
and
i
was
glad
and
grateful
beyond
measure
for
the
scent
of
roots
and
leaves
the
thick
smell
of
the
that
is
like
the
smell
of
marrow
only
the
forest
could
bring
all
things
to
calm
within
me
my
mind
was
strong
and
at
ease
day
after
day
i
tramped
over
the
wooded
hills
with
æsop
at
my
side
and
asked
no
more
than
leave
to
keep
on
going
there
day
after
day
though
most
of
the
ground
was
covered
still
with
snow
and
soft
slush
i
had
no
company
but
æsop
now
it
is
cora
but
at
that
time
it
was
æsop
my
dog
that
i
afterwards
shot
often
in
the
evening
when
i
came
back
to
the
hut
after
being
out
shooting
all
day
i
could
feel
that
kindly
homely
feeling
trickling
through
me
from
head
to
foot
a
pleasant
little
inward
shivering
and
i
would
talk
to
æsop
about
it
saying
how
comfortable
we
were
there
now
we
get
a
fire
going
and
roast
a
bird
on
the
hearth
i
would
say
what
do
you
say
to
that
and
when
it
was
done
and
we
had
both
fed
æsop
would
slip
away
to
his
place
behind
the
hearth
while
i
lit
a
pipe
and
lay
down
on
the
bench
for
a
while
listening
to
the
dead
soughing
of
the
trees
there
was
a
slight
breeze
bearing
down
towards
the
hut
and
i
could
hear
quite
clearly
the
clutter
of
a
grouse
far
away
on
the
ridge
behind
save
for
that
all
was
still
and
many
a
time
i
fell
asleep
there
as
i
lay
just
as
i
was
fully
dressed
and
all
and
did
not
wake
till
the
seabirds
began
calling
and
then
looking
out
of
the
window
i
could
see
the
big
white
buildings
of
the
trading
station
the
landing
stage
at
girilund
the
store
where
i
used
to
get
my
bread
and
i
would
lie
there
a
while
wondering
how
i
came
to
be
there
in
a
hut
on
the
fringe
of
a
forest
away
up
in
nordland
then
æsop
over
by
the
hearth
would
shake
out
his
long
slender
body
rattling
his
collar
and
yawning
and
wagging
his
tail
and
i
would
jump
up
after
those
three
or
four
hours
of
sleep
fully
rested
and
full
of
joy
in
everything
everything
many
a
night
passed
just
that
way
ii
rain
and
storm
is
not
such
things
that
count
many
a
time
some
little
joy
can
come
along
on
a
rainy
day
and
make
a
man
turn
off
somewhere
to
be
alone
with
his
happiness
stand
up
somewhere
and
look
out
straight
ahead
laughing
quietly
now
and
again
and
looking
round
what
is
there
to
think
of
one
clear
pane
in
a
window
a
ray
of
sunlight
in
the
pane
the
sight
of
a
little
brook
or
maybe
a
blue
strip
of
sky
between
the
clouds
it
needs
no
more
than
that
at
other
times
even
quite
unusual
happenings
can
not
avail
to
lift
a
man
from
dulness
and
poverty
of
mind
one
can
sit
in
the
middle
of
a
ballroom
and
be
cool
indifferent
unaffected
by
anything
sorrow
and
joy
are
from
within
oneself
one
day
i
remember
now
i
had
gone
down
to
the
coast
the
rain
came
on
suddenly
and
i
slipped
into
an
open
boathouse
to
sit
down
for
a
while
i
was
humming
a
little
but
not
for
any
joy
or
pleasure
only
to
pass
the
time
æsop
was
with
me
he
sat
up
listening
and
i
stopped
humming
and
listened
as
well
voices
outside
people
coming
nearer
a
mere
chance
nothing
more
natural
a
little
party
two
men
and
a
girl
came
tumbling
in
suddenly
to
where
i
sat
calling
to
one
another
and
laughing
quick
get
in
here
till
it
stops
i
got
up
one
of
the
men
had
a
white
shirt
front
soft
and
now
soaked
with
rain
into
the
bargain
and
all
bagging
down
and
in
that
wet
shirt
front
a
diamond
clasp
long
pointed
shoes
he
wore
too
that
looked
somewhat
affected
i
gave
him
it
was
mack
the
trader
i
knew
him
because
he
was
from
the
store
where
i
used
to
get
my
bread
he
had
asked
me
to
look
in
at
the
house
any
time
but
i
had
not
been
there
yet
aha
it
you
is
it
said
mack
at
sight
of
me
we
were
going
up
to
the
mill
but
had
to
turn
back
ever
see
such
weather
what
and
when
are
you
coming
up
to
see
us
at
sirilund
lieutenant
he
introduced
the
little
man
who
was
with
him
a
doctor
staying
down
near
the
church
the
girl
lifted
her
veil
the
least
little
bit
to
her
nose
and
started
talking
to
æsop
in
a
whisper
i
noticed
her
jacket
i
could
see
from
the
lining
and
the
buttonholes
that
it
had
been
dyed
mack
introduced
me
to
her
as
well
his
daughter
edwarda
edwarda
gave
me
one
glance
through
her
veil
and
went
on
whispering
to
the
dog
and
reading
on
its
collar
so
you
called
æsop
are
you
doctor
who
was
æsop
all
i
can
remember
is
that
he
wrote
fables
was
he
a
phrygian
i
a
child
a
schoolgirl
i
looked
at
her
she
was
tall
but
with
no
figure
to
speak
of
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
with
long
dark
hands
and
no
gloves
like
as
not
she
had
looked
up
æsop
in
the
dictionary
that
afternoon
to
have
it
ready
mack
asked
me
what
sport
i
was
having
what
did
i
shoot
mostly
i
could
have
one
of
his
boats
at
any
time
if
i
wanted
only
let
him
know
the
doctor
said
nothing
at
all
when
they
went
off
again
i
noticed
that
the
doctor
limped
a
little
and
walked
with
a
stick
i
walked
home
as
empty
in
mind
as
before
humming
all
indifferently
that
meeting
in
the
boathouse
had
made
no
difference
either
way
to
me
the
one
thing
i
remembered
best
of
all
was
mack
wet
shirt
front
with
a
diamond
clasp
the
diamond
all
wet
too
and
no
great
brilliance
about
it
either
iii
there
was
a
stone
outside
my
hut
a
tall
grey
stone
it
looked
as
if
it
had
a
sort
of
friendly
feeling
towards
me
as
if
it
noticed
me
when
i
came
by
and
knew
me
again
i
liked
to
go
round
that
way
past
the
stone
when
i
went
out
in
the
morning
it
was
like
leaving
a
good
friend
there
who
i
knew
would
be
still
waiting
for
me
when
i
came
back
then
up
in
the
woods
hunting
sometimes
finding
game
sometimes
none
out
beyond
the
islands
the
sea
lay
heavily
calm
many
a
time
i
have
stood
and
looked
at
it
from
the
hills
far
up
above
on
a
calm
day
the
ships
seemed
hardly
to
move
at
all
i
could
see
the
same
sail
for
three
days
small
and
white
like
a
gull
on
the
water
then
perhaps
if
the
wind
veered
round
the
peaks
in
the
distance
would
almost
disappear
and
there
came
a
storm
the
gale
a
play
for
me
to
stand
and
watch
all
things
in
a
seething
mist
earth
and
sky
mingled
together
the
sea
flung
up
into
fantastic
dancing
figures
of
men
and
horses
and
fluttering
banners
on
the
air
i
stood
in
the
shelter
of
an
overhanging
rock
thinking
many
things
my
soul
was
tense
heaven
knows
i
thought
to
myself
what
it
is
i
am
watching
here
and
why
the
sea
should
open
before
my
eyes
maybe
i
am
seeing
now
the
inner
brain
of
earth
how
things
are
at
work
there
boiling
and
foaming
æsop
was
restless
now
and
again
he
would
thrust
up
his
muzzle
and
sniff
in
a
troubled
way
with
legs
quivering
uneasily
when
i
took
no
notice
he
lay
down
between
my
feet
and
stared
out
to
sea
as
i
was
doing
and
never
a
cry
never
a
word
of
human
voice
to
be
heard
anywhere
nothing
only
the
heavy
rush
of
the
wind
about
my
head
there
was
a
reef
of
rocks
far
out
lying
all
apart
when
the
sea
raged
up
over
it
the
water
towered
like
a
crazy
screw
nay
like
a
rising
wet
in
the
air
and
snorting
till
hair
and
beard
stood
out
like
a
wheel
about
his
head
then
he
plunged
down
into
the
breakers
once
more
and
in
the
midst
of
the
storm
a
little
steamer
fighting
its
way
in
when
i
went
down
to
the
quay
in
the
afternoon
the
little
steamer
had
come
in
it
was
the
many
people
had
gathered
on
the
quayside
to
see
the
rare
visitor
i
noticed
that
all
without
exception
had
blue
eyes
however
different
they
might
be
in
other
ways
a
young
girl
with
a
white
woolen
kerchief
over
her
head
stood
a
little
apart
she
had
very
dark
hair
and
the
white
kerchief
showed
up
strangely
against
it
she
looked
at
me
curiously
at
my
leather
suit
my
gun
when
i
spoke
to
her
she
was
embarrassed
and
turned
her
head
away
i
said
you
should
always
wear
a
white
kerchief
like
that
it
suits
you
just
then
a
burly
man
in
an
iceland
jersey
came
up
and
joined
her
he
called
her
eva
evidently
she
was
his
daughter
i
knew
the
burly
man
he
was
the
local
smith
the
blacksmith
only
a
few
days
back
he
had
mended
the
nipple
of
one
of
my
guns
and
rain
and
wind
did
their
work
and
thawed
away
the
snow
for
some
days
a
cheerless
cold
hovered
over
the
earth
rotten
branches
snapped
and
the
crows
gathered
in
flocks
complaining
but
it
was
not
for
long
the
sun
was
near
and
one
day
it
rose
up
behind
the
forest
it
sends
a
strip
of
sweetness
through
me
from
head
to
foot
when
the
sun
comes
up
i
shoulder
my
gun
with
quiet
delight
iv
i
was
never
short
of
game
those
days
but
shot
all
i
cared
to
a
hare
a
grouse
a
ptarmigan
and
when
i
happened
to
be
down
near
the
shore
and
came
within
range
of
some
seabird
or
other
i
shot
it
too
it
was
a
pleasant
time
the
days
grew
longer
and
the
air
clearer
i
packed
up
things
for
a
couple
of
days
and
set
off
up
into
the
hills
up
to
the
mountain
peaks
i
met
reindeer
lapps
and
they
gave
me
cheese
rich
little
cheeses
tasting
of
herbs
i
went
up
that
way
more
than
once
then
going
home
again
i
always
shot
some
bird
or
other
to
put
in
my
bag
i
sat
down
and
put
æsop
on
the
lead
miles
below
me
was
the
sea
the
mountainsides
were
wet
and
black
with
the
water
running
down
them
dripping
and
trickling
always
with
the
same
little
sound
that
little
sound
of
the
water
far
up
on
the
hills
has
shortened
many
an
hour
for
me
when
i
sat
looking
about
here
i
thought
to
myself
is
a
little
endless
song
trickling
away
all
to
itself
and
no
one
ever
hears
it
and
no
one
ever
thinks
of
it
and
still
it
trickles
on
nevertheless
to
itself
all
the
time
all
the
time
and
i
felt
that
the
mountains
were
no
longer
quite
deserted
as
long
as
i
could
hear
that
little
trickling
song
now
and
again
something
would
happen
a
clap
of
thunder
shaking
the
earth
a
mass
of
rock
slipping
loose
and
rushing
down
towards
the
sea
leaving
a
trail
of
smoking
dust
behind
æsop
turned
his
nose
to
the
wind
at
once
sniffing
in
surprise
at
the
smell
of
burning
that
he
could
not
understand
when
the
melting
of
the
snow
had
made
rifts
in
the
hillside
a
shot
or
even
a
sharp
cry
was
enough
to
loosen
a
great
block
and
send
it
tumbling
down
an
hour
might
pass
or
perhaps
more
the
time
went
so
quickly
i
let
æsop
loose
slung
my
bag
over
the
other
shoulder
and
set
off
towards
home
it
was
getting
late
lower
down
in
the
forest
i
came
unfailingly
upon
my
old
path
a
narrow
ribbon
of
a
path
with
the
strangest
bends
and
turns
i
followed
each
one
of
them
taking
my
time
there
was
no
hurry
no
one
waiting
for
me
at
home
free
as
a
lord
a
ruler
i
could
ramble
about
there
in
the
peaceful
woods
just
as
idly
as
i
pleased
all
the
birds
were
silent
only
the
grouse
was
calling
far
away
it
was
always
calling
i
came
out
of
the
wood
and
saw
two
figures
ahead
two
persons
moving
i
came
up
with
them
one
was
edwarda
and
i
recognized
her
and
gave
a
greeting
the
doctor
was
with
her
i
had
to
show
them
my
gun
they
looked
at
my
compass
my
bag
i
invited
them
to
my
hut
and
they
promised
to
come
some
day
it
was
evening
now
i
went
home
and
lit
a
fire
roasted
a
bird
and
had
a
meal
there
would
be
another
day
all
things
quiet
and
still
i
lay
that
evening
looking
out
the
window
there
was
a
fairy
glimmer
at
that
hour
over
wood
and
field
the
sun
had
gone
down
and
dyed
the
horizon
with
a
rich
red
light
that
stood
there
still
as
oil
the
sky
all
open
and
clean
i
stared
into
that
clear
sea
and
it
seemed
as
if
i
were
lying
face
to
face
with
the
uttermost
depth
of
the
world
my
heart
beating
tensely
against
it
and
at
home
there
god
knows
i
thought
to
myself
god
knows
why
the
sky
is
dressed
in
gold
and
mauve
if
there
is
not
some
festival
going
on
up
there
in
the
world
some
great
feast
with
music
from
the
stars
and
boats
gliding
along
river
ways
it
looks
so
and
i
closed
my
eyes
and
followed
the
boats
and
thoughts
and
thoughts
floated
through
my
mind
so
more
than
one
day
passed
i
wandered
about
noting
how
the
snow
turned
to
water
how
the
ice
loosed
its
hold
many
a
day
i
did
not
even
fire
a
shot
when
i
had
food
enough
in
the
hut
only
wandered
about
in
my
freedom
and
let
the
time
pass
whichever
way
i
turned
there
was
always
just
as
much
to
see
and
hear
all
things
changing
a
little
every
day
even
the
osier
thickets
and
the
juniper
stood
waiting
for
the
spring
one
day
i
went
out
to
the
mill
it
was
still
icebound
but
the
earth
around
it
had
been
trampled
through
many
and
many
a
year
showing
how
men
and
more
men
had
come
that
way
with
sacks
of
corn
on
their
shoulders
to
be
ground
it
was
like
walking
among
human
beings
to
go
there
and
there
were
many
dates
and
letters
cut
in
the
walls
well
well
v
shall
i
write
more
no
no
only
a
little
for
my
own
amusement
sake
and
because
it
passes
the
time
for
me
to
tell
of
how
the
spring
came
two
years
back
and
how
everything
looked
then
earth
and
sea
began
to
smell
a
little
there
was
a
sweetish
rotting
smell
from
the
dead
leaves
in
the
wood
and
the
magpies
flew
with
twigs
in
their
beaks
building
their
nests
a
couple
of
days
more
and
the
brooks
began
to
swell
and
foam
here
and
there
a
butterfly
was
to
be
seen
and
the
fishermen
came
home
from
their
stations
the
trader
two
boats
came
in
laden
deep
with
fish
and
anchored
off
the
drying
grounds
there
was
life
and
commotion
all
of
a
sudden
out
on
the
biggest
of
the
islands
where
the
fish
were
to
be
spread
on
the
rocks
to
dry
i
could
see
it
all
from
my
window
but
no
noise
reached
the
hut
i
was
alone
and
remained
so
now
and
again
someone
would
pass
i
saw
eva
the
blacksmith
girl
she
had
got
a
couple
of
freckles
on
her
nose
where
are
you
going
i
asked
out
for
firewood
she
answered
quietly
she
had
a
rope
in
her
hand
to
carry
the
wood
and
her
white
kerchief
on
her
head
i
stood
watching
her
but
she
did
not
turn
round
after
that
i
saw
no
one
for
days
the
spring
was
urging
and
the
forest
listened
it
was
a
great
delight
to
watch
the
thrushes
sitting
in
the
staring
at
the
sun
and
crying
sometimes
i
would
get
up
as
early
as
two
in
the
morning
just
for
a
share
of
the
joy
that
went
out
from
bird
and
beast
at
sunrise
the
spring
had
reached
me
too
maybe
and
my
blood
beat
at
times
as
if
it
were
footsteps
i
sat
in
the
hut
and
thought
of
overhauling
my
fishing
rods
and
lines
and
gear
but
moved
never
a
finger
to
any
work
at
all
for
a
glad
mysterious
restlessness
that
was
in
and
out
of
my
heart
all
the
while
then
suddenly
æsop
sprang
up
stood
and
stiffened
and
gave
a
short
bark
someone
coming
to
the
hut
i
pulled
off
my
cap
quickly
and
heard
edwarda
voice
already
at
the
door
kindly
and
without
ceremony
she
and
the
doctor
had
come
to
pay
me
a
visit
as
they
had
said
yes
i
heard
her
say
he
is
at
and
she
stepped
forward
and
gave
me
her
hand
in
her
simple
girlish
way
we
were
here
yesterday
but
you
were
out
she
said
she
sat
down
on
the
rug
over
my
wooden
bedstead
and
looked
round
the
hut
the
doctor
sat
down
beside
me
on
the
long
bench
we
talked
chatted
away
at
ease
i
told
them
things
such
as
what
kinds
of
animals
there
were
in
the
woods
and
what
game
i
could
not
shoot
because
of
the
closed
season
it
was
the
closed
season
for
grouse
just
now
the
doctor
did
not
say
much
this
time
either
but
catching
sight
of
my
with
a
figure
of
pan
carved
on
it
he
started
to
explain
the
myth
of
pan
but
said
edwarda
suddenly
what
do
you
live
on
when
it
closed
season
for
all
game
fish
i
said
fish
mostly
but
there
always
something
to
but
you
might
come
up
to
us
for
your
meals
she
said
there
was
an
englishman
here
last
year
he
had
taken
the
hut
and
he
often
came
to
us
for
edwarda
looked
at
me
and
i
at
her
i
felt
at
the
moment
something
touching
my
heart
like
a
little
fleeting
welcome
it
must
have
been
the
spring
and
the
bright
day
i
have
thought
it
over
since
also
i
admired
the
curve
of
her
eyebrows
she
said
something
about
my
place
how
i
had
arranged
things
in
the
hut
i
had
hung
up
skins
of
several
sorts
on
the
walls
and
birds
wings
it
looked
like
a
shaggy
den
on
the
inside
she
liked
it
yes
a
den
she
said
i
had
nothing
to
offer
my
visitors
that
they
would
care
about
i
thought
of
it
and
would
have
roasted
a
bird
for
them
just
for
amusement
let
them
eat
it
hunter
fashion
with
their
fingers
it
might
amuse
them
and
i
cooked
the
bird
edwarda
told
about
the
englishman
an
old
man
an
eccentric
who
talked
aloud
to
himself
he
was
a
roman
catholic
and
always
carried
a
little
with
red
and
black
letters
about
with
him
wherever
he
went
was
he
an
irishman
then
asked
the
doctor
an
irishman
yes
since
he
was
a
roman
edwarda
blushed
and
stammered
and
looked
away
well
yes
perhaps
he
was
an
after
that
she
lost
her
liveliness
i
felt
sorry
for
her
and
tried
to
put
matters
straight
again
i
said
no
of
course
you
are
right
he
was
an
englishman
irishmen
do
go
travelling
about
in
we
agreed
to
row
over
one
day
and
see
the
grounds
when
i
had
seen
my
visitors
a
few
steps
on
their
way
i
walked
home
again
and
sat
down
to
work
at
my
fishing
gear
my
had
been
hung
from
a
nail
by
the
door
and
several
of
the
meshes
were
damaged
by
rust
i
sharpened
up
some
hooks
knotted
them
to
lengths
of
line
and
looked
to
the
other
nets
how
hard
it
seemed
to
do
any
work
at
all
thoughts
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
business
in
hand
kept
coming
and
going
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
done
wrong
in
letting
edwarda
sit
on
the
bed
all
the
time
instead
of
offering
her
a
seat
on
the
bench
i
saw
before
me
suddenly
her
brown
face
and
neck
she
had
fastened
her
apron
a
little
low
down
in
front
to
be
as
was
the
fashion
the
girlish
contour
of
her
thumb
affected
me
tenderly
and
the
little
wrinkles
above
the
knuckle
were
full
of
kindliness
her
mouth
was
large
and
rich
i
rose
up
and
opened
the
door
and
looked
out
i
could
hear
nothing
and
indeed
there
was
nothing
to
listen
for
i
closed
the
door
again
æsop
came
up
from
his
and
noticed
that
i
was
restless
about
something
then
it
struck
me
that
i
might
run
after
edwarda
and
ask
her
for
a
little
silk
thread
to
mend
my
net
with
it
would
not
be
any
pretence
i
could
take
down
the
net
and
show
her
where
the
meshes
were
spoiled
by
rust
i
was
already
outside
the
door
when
i
remembered
that
i
had
silk
thread
myself
in
my
more
indeed
than
i
wanted
and
i
went
back
slowly
discouraged
to
think
that
i
had
silk
thread
myself
a
breath
of
something
strange
met
me
as
i
entered
the
hut
again
it
seemed
as
if
i
were
no
longer
alone
there
vi
a
man
asked
me
if
i
had
given
up
shooting
he
had
not
heard
me
fire
a
shot
up
in
the
hills
though
he
had
been
out
fishing
for
two
days
no
i
had
shot
nothing
i
had
stayed
at
home
in
the
hut
until
i
had
no
more
food
in
the
place
on
the
third
day
i
went
out
with
my
gun
the
woods
were
getting
green
there
was
a
smell
of
earth
and
trees
the
young
grass
was
already
springing
up
from
the
frozen
moss
i
was
in
a
thoughtful
mood
and
sat
down
several
times
for
three
days
i
had
not
seen
a
soul
except
the
one
fisherman
i
had
met
the
day
before
i
thought
to
myself
perhaps
i
may
meet
someone
this
evening
on
the
way
home
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
where
i
met
the
doctor
and
edwarda
before
perhaps
they
may
be
going
for
a
walk
that
way
again
perhaps
perhaps
but
why
should
i
think
of
those
two
in
particular
i
shot
a
couple
of
ptarmigan
and
cooked
one
of
them
at
once
then
i
tied
up
the
dog
i
lay
down
on
the
dry
ground
to
eat
the
earth
was
quiet
only
a
little
breath
of
wind
and
the
sound
of
a
bird
here
and
there
i
lay
and
watched
the
branches
waving
gently
in
the
breeze
the
little
wind
was
at
its
work
carrying
pollen
from
branch
to
branch
and
filling
every
innocent
bloom
all
the
forest
seemed
filled
with
delight
a
green
worm
thing
a
caterpillar
dragged
itself
end
by
end
along
a
branch
dragging
along
unceasingly
as
if
it
could
not
rest
it
saw
hardly
anything
for
all
it
had
eyes
often
it
stood
straight
up
in
the
air
feeling
about
for
something
to
take
hold
of
it
looked
like
a
stump
of
green
thread
sewing
a
seam
with
long
stitches
along
the
branch
by
evening
perhaps
it
would
have
reached
its
goal
quiet
as
ever
i
get
up
and
move
on
sit
down
and
get
up
again
it
is
about
four
about
six
i
can
start
for
home
and
see
if
i
happen
to
meet
anyone
two
hours
to
wait
a
little
restless
already
i
brush
the
dust
and
heather
from
my
clothes
i
know
the
places
i
pass
by
trees
and
stones
stand
there
as
before
in
their
solitude
the
leaves
rustle
underfoot
as
i
walk
the
monotonous
breathing
and
the
familiar
trees
and
stones
mean
much
to
me
i
am
filled
with
a
strange
thankfulness
everything
seems
well
disposed
towards
me
mingles
with
my
being
i
love
it
all
i
pick
up
a
little
dry
twig
and
hold
it
in
my
hand
and
sit
looking
at
it
and
think
my
own
thoughts
the
twig
is
almost
rotten
its
poor
bark
touches
me
pity
fills
my
heart
and
when
i
get
up
again
i
do
not
throw
the
twig
far
away
but
lay
it
down
and
stand
liking
it
at
last
i
look
at
it
once
more
with
wet
eyes
before
i
go
away
and
leave
it
there
five
the
sun
tells
me
false
time
today
i
have
been
walking
westward
the
whole
day
and
come
perhaps
half
an
hour
ahead
of
my
sun
marks
at
the
hut
i
am
quite
aware
of
all
this
but
none
the
less
there
is
an
hour
yet
before
six
so
i
get
up
again
and
go
on
a
little
and
the
leaves
rustle
under
foot
an
hour
goes
that
way
i
look
down
at
the
little
stream
and
the
little
mill
that
has
been
icebound
all
the
winter
and
i
stop
the
mill
is
working
the
noise
of
it
wakes
me
and
i
stop
suddenly
there
and
then
i
have
stayed
out
too
long
i
say
aloud
a
pang
goes
through
me
i
turn
at
once
and
begin
walking
homewards
but
all
the
time
i
know
i
have
stayed
out
too
long
i
walk
faster
then
run
æsop
understands
there
is
something
the
matter
and
pulls
at
the
leash
drags
me
along
sniffs
at
the
ground
and
is
all
haste
the
dry
leaves
crackle
about
us
but
when
we
come
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
there
was
no
one
there
no
all
was
quiet
there
was
no
one
there
there
is
no
one
here
i
said
to
myself
and
yet
it
was
no
worse
than
i
had
expected
i
did
not
stay
long
but
walked
on
drawn
by
all
my
thoughts
passed
by
my
hut
and
went
down
to
sirilund
with
æsop
and
my
bag
and
gun
with
all
my
belongings
herr
mack
received
me
with
the
greatest
friendliness
and
asked
me
to
stay
to
supper
vii
i
fancy
i
can
read
a
little
in
the
souls
of
those
about
me
but
perhaps
it
is
not
so
oh
when
my
good
days
come
i
feel
as
if
i
could
see
far
into
others
souls
though
i
am
no
great
or
clever
head
we
sit
in
a
room
some
men
some
women
and
i
and
i
seem
to
see
what
is
passing
within
them
and
what
they
think
of
me
i
find
something
in
every
swift
little
change
of
light
in
their
eyes
sometimes
the
blood
rises
to
their
cheeks
and
reddens
them
at
other
times
they
pretend
to
be
looking
another
way
and
yet
they
watch
me
covertly
from
the
side
there
i
sit
marking
all
this
and
no
one
dreams
that
i
see
through
every
soul
for
years
past
i
have
felt
that
i
could
read
the
souls
of
all
i
met
but
perhaps
it
is
not
so
i
stayed
at
herr
mack
house
all
that
evening
i
might
have
gone
off
again
at
once
it
did
not
interest
me
to
stay
sitting
there
but
had
i
not
come
because
all
my
thoughts
were
drawing
me
that
way
and
how
could
i
go
again
at
once
we
played
whist
and
drank
toddy
after
supper
i
sat
with
my
back
turned
to
the
rest
of
the
room
and
my
head
bent
down
behind
me
edwarda
went
in
and
out
the
doctor
had
gone
home
herr
mack
showed
me
the
design
of
his
new
lamps
the
first
paraffin
lamps
to
be
seen
so
far
north
they
were
splendid
things
with
a
heavy
leaden
base
and
he
lit
them
himself
every
evening
to
prevent
any
accident
he
spoke
once
or
twice
of
his
grandfather
the
consul
this
brooch
was
given
to
my
grandfather
consul
mack
by
carl
johan
with
his
own
hands
he
said
pointing
one
finger
at
the
diamond
in
his
shirt
his
wife
was
dead
he
showed
me
a
painted
portrait
of
her
in
one
of
the
other
rooms
a
distinguished
looking
woman
with
a
lace
cap
and
a
winsome
smile
in
the
same
room
also
there
was
a
bookcase
and
some
old
french
books
no
less
that
might
have
been
an
heirloom
the
bindings
were
rich
and
gilded
and
many
owners
had
marked
their
names
in
them
among
the
books
were
several
educational
works
herr
mack
was
a
man
of
some
intelligence
his
two
assistants
from
the
store
were
called
in
to
make
up
the
party
at
whist
they
played
slowly
and
doubtfully
counted
carefully
and
made
mistakes
all
the
same
edwarda
helped
one
of
them
with
his
hand
i
upset
my
glass
and
felt
ashamed
and
stood
up
there
i
have
upset
my
glass
i
said
edwarda
burst
out
laughing
and
answered
well
we
can
see
everyone
assured
me
laughingly
that
it
did
not
matter
they
gave
me
a
towel
to
wipe
myself
with
and
we
went
on
with
the
game
soon
it
was
eleven
i
felt
a
vague
displeasure
at
edwarda
laugh
i
looked
at
her
and
found
that
her
face
had
become
insignificant
hardly
even
pretty
at
last
herr
mack
broke
off
the
game
saying
that
his
assistants
must
go
to
bed
then
he
leaned
back
on
the
sofa
and
began
talking
about
putting
up
a
sign
in
front
of
his
place
he
asked
my
advice
about
it
what
colour
did
i
think
would
be
best
i
was
not
interested
and
answered
black
without
thinking
at
all
and
herr
mack
at
once
agreed
black
yes
exactly
what
i
had
been
thinking
myself
and
in
heavy
black
letters
that
ought
to
look
as
nice
as
anything
edwarda
is
it
time
you
were
going
to
bed
edwarda
rose
shook
hands
with
us
both
said
and
left
the
room
we
sat
on
we
talked
of
the
railway
that
had
been
finished
last
year
and
of
the
first
telegraph
line
wonder
when
we
shall
have
the
telegraph
up
pause
it
like
this
said
herr
mack
time
goes
on
and
here
am
i
and
hair
and
beard
gone
grey
you
might
see
me
in
the
daytime
and
say
i
was
a
young
man
but
when
the
evening
comes
along
and
i
all
alone
i
feel
it
a
good
deal
i
sit
here
mostly
playing
patience
it
works
out
all
right
as
a
rule
if
you
fudge
a
little
haha
if
you
fudge
a
little
i
asked
i
felt
as
if
i
could
read
in
his
eyes
he
got
up
from
his
seat
walked
over
to
the
window
and
looked
out
he
stooped
a
little
and
the
back
of
his
neck
was
hairy
i
rose
in
my
turn
he
looked
round
and
walked
towards
me
in
his
long
pointed
shoes
stuck
both
thumbs
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
waved
his
arms
a
little
as
if
they
were
wings
and
smiled
then
he
offered
me
his
boat
again
if
ever
i
wanted
one
and
held
out
his
hand
wait
a
minute
i
go
with
you
he
said
and
blew
out
the
lamps
yes
yes
i
feel
like
a
little
walk
it
not
so
we
went
out
he
pointed
up
the
road
towards
the
blacksmith
and
said
this
way
it
the
no
i
said
round
by
the
quay
is
the
shortest
we
argued
the
point
a
little
and
did
not
agree
i
was
convinced
that
i
was
right
and
could
not
understand
why
he
insisted
at
last
he
suggested
that
we
should
each
go
his
own
way
the
one
who
got
there
first
could
wait
at
the
hut
we
set
off
and
he
was
soon
lost
to
sight
in
the
wood
i
walked
at
my
usual
pace
and
reckoned
to
be
there
a
good
five
minutes
ahead
but
when
i
got
to
the
hut
he
was
there
already
he
called
out
as
i
came
up
what
did
i
say
i
always
go
this
way
it
the
i
looked
at
him
in
surprise
he
was
not
heated
and
did
not
appear
to
have
been
running
he
did
not
stay
now
but
said
in
a
friendly
way
and
went
back
the
way
he
had
come
i
stood
there
and
thought
to
myself
this
is
strange
i
ought
to
be
some
judge
of
distance
and
i
walked
both
those
ways
several
times
my
good
man
you
been
fudging
again
was
the
whole
thing
a
pretence
i
saw
his
back
as
he
disappeared
into
the
wood
again
next
moment
i
started
off
in
track
of
him
going
quickly
and
cautiously
i
could
see
him
wiping
his
face
all
the
way
and
i
was
not
so
sure
now
that
he
had
not
been
running
before
i
walked
very
slowly
now
and
watched
him
carefully
he
stopped
at
the
blacksmith
i
stepped
into
hiding
and
saw
the
door
open
and
herr
mack
enter
the
house
it
was
one
i
could
tell
by
the
look
of
the
sea
and
the
grass
viii
a
few
days
passed
as
best
they
could
my
only
friend
was
the
forest
and
the
great
loneliness
dear
god
i
had
never
before
known
what
it
was
to
be
so
alone
as
on
the
first
of
those
days
it
was
full
spring
now
i
had
found
wintergreen
and
milfoil
already
and
the
chaffinches
had
come
i
knew
all
the
birds
now
and
again
i
took
a
couple
of
coins
from
my
pocket
and
rattled
them
to
break
the
loneliness
i
thought
to
myself
what
if
diderik
and
iselin
were
to
appear
night
was
coming
on
again
the
sun
just
dipped
into
the
sea
and
rose
again
red
refreshed
as
if
it
had
been
down
to
drink
i
could
feel
more
strangely
on
those
nights
than
anyone
would
believe
was
pan
himself
there
sitting
in
a
tree
watching
me
to
see
what
i
might
do
was
his
belly
open
and
he
sitting
there
bent
over
as
if
drinking
from
his
own
belly
but
all
that
he
did
only
that
he
might
look
up
under
his
brows
and
watch
me
and
the
whole
tree
shook
with
his
silent
laughter
when
he
saw
how
all
my
thoughts
were
running
away
with
me
there
was
a
rustling
everywhere
in
the
woods
beasts
sniffing
birds
calling
one
to
another
their
signals
filled
the
air
and
it
was
flying
year
for
the
maybug
its
humming
mingled
with
the
buzz
of
the
night
moths
sounded
like
a
whispering
here
and
a
whispering
there
all
about
in
the
woods
so
much
there
was
to
hear
for
three
nights
i
did
not
sleep
i
thought
of
diderik
and
iselin
see
now
i
thought
they
might
and
iselin
would
lead
diderik
away
to
a
tree
and
say
stand
here
diderik
and
keep
guard
keep
watch
i
will
let
this
huntsman
tie
my
and
the
huntsman
is
myself
and
she
will
give
me
a
glance
of
her
eyes
that
i
may
understand
and
when
she
comes
my
heart
knows
all
and
no
longer
beats
like
a
heart
but
rings
as
a
bell
i
lay
my
hand
on
her
tie
my
she
says
with
flushed
cheeks
the
sun
dips
down
into
the
sea
and
rises
again
red
and
refreshed
as
if
it
had
been
to
drink
and
the
air
is
full
of
whisperings
an
hour
after
she
speaks
close
to
my
mouth
now
i
must
leave
and
she
turns
and
waves
her
hand
to
me
as
she
goes
and
her
face
is
flushed
still
her
face
is
tender
and
full
of
delight
and
again
she
turns
and
waves
to
me
but
diderik
steps
out
from
under
the
tree
and
says
iselin
what
have
you
done
i
saw
she
answers
diderik
what
did
you
see
i
have
done
iselin
i
saw
what
you
did
he
says
again
i
saw
and
then
her
rich
glad
laughter
rings
through
the
wood
and
she
goes
off
with
him
full
of
rejoicing
from
top
to
toe
and
whither
does
she
go
to
the
next
mortal
man
to
a
huntsman
in
the
woods
it
was
midnight
æsop
had
broken
loose
and
been
out
hunting
by
himself
i
heard
him
baying
up
in
the
hills
and
when
at
last
i
got
him
back
it
was
one
a
girl
came
from
herding
goats
she
fastened
her
stocking
and
hummed
a
tune
and
looked
around
but
where
was
her
flock
and
what
was
she
doing
in
the
woods
at
midnight
ah
nothing
nothing
walking
there
for
restlessness
perhaps
for
joy
was
her
affair
i
thought
to
myself
she
had
heard
æsop
in
the
woods
and
knew
that
i
was
out
as
she
came
up
i
rose
and
stood
and
looked
at
her
and
i
saw
how
slight
and
young
she
was
æsop
too
stood
looking
at
her
where
do
you
come
from
i
asked
from
the
mill
she
answered
but
what
could
she
have
been
doing
at
the
mill
so
late
at
night
how
can
you
venture
into
the
woods
so
late
i
said
you
so
slight
and
young
she
laughed
and
said
i
am
not
so
young
i
am
but
she
could
not
be
nineteen
i
am
certain
she
was
lying
by
at
least
two
years
and
was
only
seventeen
but
why
should
she
lie
to
seem
older
sit
down
i
said
and
tell
me
your
and
she
sat
down
blushing
by
my
side
and
told
me
her
name
was
henriette
then
i
asked
her
have
you
a
lover
henriette
and
has
he
ever
taken
you
in
his
arms
yes
she
said
smiling
shyly
how
many
times
she
was
silent
how
many
times
i
asked
her
again
twice
she
answered
softly
i
drew
her
to
me
and
said
how
did
he
do
it
was
it
like
this
yes
she
whispered
trembling
ix
i
had
some
talk
with
edwarda
we
shall
have
rain
before
long
i
said
what
time
is
it
she
asked
i
looked
at
the
sun
and
answered
about
she
asked
can
you
tell
so
nearly
by
the
sun
yes
i
answered
i
pause
but
when
you
ca
see
the
sun
how
do
you
tell
the
time
then
then
i
can
tell
by
other
things
there
high
tide
and
low
tide
and
the
grass
that
lies
over
at
certain
hours
and
the
song
of
the
birds
that
changes
some
birds
begin
to
sing
when
others
leave
off
then
i
can
tell
the
time
by
flowers
that
close
in
the
afternoon
and
leaves
that
are
bright
green
at
some
times
and
dull
green
at
others
and
then
besides
i
can
feel
i
now
i
was
expecting
rain
and
for
edwarda
sake
i
would
not
keep
her
there
any
longer
on
the
road
i
raised
my
cap
but
she
stopped
me
suddenly
with
a
new
question
and
i
stayed
she
blushed
and
asked
me
why
i
had
come
to
the
place
at
all
why
i
went
out
shooting
and
why
this
and
why
that
for
i
never
shot
more
than
i
needed
for
food
and
left
my
dog
idle
she
looked
flushed
and
humble
i
understood
that
someone
had
been
talking
about
me
and
she
had
heard
it
she
was
not
speaking
for
herself
and
something
about
her
called
up
a
feeling
of
tenderness
in
me
she
looked
so
helpless
i
remembered
that
she
had
no
mother
her
thin
arms
gave
her
an
appearance
i
could
not
help
feeling
it
so
well
i
did
not
go
out
shooting
just
to
murder
things
but
to
live
i
had
need
of
one
grouse
and
so
i
did
not
shoot
two
but
would
shoot
the
other
why
kill
more
i
lived
in
the
woods
as
a
son
of
the
woods
and
from
the
first
of
june
it
was
closed
time
for
hare
and
ptarmigan
there
was
but
little
left
for
me
to
shoot
at
all
now
well
and
good
then
i
could
go
fishing
and
live
on
fish
i
would
borrow
her
father
boat
and
row
out
in
that
no
indeed
i
did
no
go
out
shooting
for
the
lust
of
killing
things
but
only
to
live
in
the
woods
it
was
a
good
place
for
me
i
could
lie
down
on
the
ground
at
meals
instead
of
sitting
upright
on
a
chair
i
did
not
upset
my
glass
there
in
the
woods
i
could
do
as
i
pleased
i
could
lie
down
flat
on
my
back
and
close
my
eyes
if
i
pleased
and
i
could
say
whatever
i
liked
to
say
often
one
might
feel
a
wish
to
say
something
to
speak
aloud
and
in
the
woods
it
sounded
like
speech
from
the
very
heart
when
i
asked
her
if
she
understood
all
this
she
said
and
i
went
on
and
told
her
more
because
her
eyes
were
on
me
if
you
only
knew
all
that
i
see
out
in
the
wilds
i
said
in
winter
i
come
walking
along
and
see
perhaps
the
tracks
of
ptarmigan
in
the
snow
suddenly
the
track
disappears
the
bird
has
taken
wing
but
from
the
marks
of
the
wings
i
can
see
which
way
the
game
has
flown
and
before
long
i
have
tracked
it
down
again
there
is
always
a
touch
of
newness
in
that
for
me
in
autumn
many
a
time
there
are
shooting
stars
to
watch
then
i
think
to
myself
being
all
alone
what
was
that
a
world
seized
with
convulsions
all
of
a
sudden
a
world
going
all
to
pieces
before
my
eyes
to
think
that
i
that
should
be
granted
the
sight
of
shooting
stars
in
my
life
and
when
summer
comes
then
perhaps
there
may
be
a
little
living
creature
on
every
leaf
i
can
see
that
some
of
them
have
no
wings
they
can
make
no
great
way
in
the
world
but
must
live
and
die
on
that
one
little
leaf
where
they
came
into
the
world
then
sometimes
i
see
the
blue
flies
but
it
all
seems
such
a
little
thing
to
talk
about
i
do
know
if
you
understand
yes
yes
i
good
well
then
sometimes
i
look
at
the
grass
and
perhaps
the
grass
is
looking
at
me
again
who
can
say
i
look
at
a
single
blade
of
grass
it
quivers
a
little
maybe
and
thinks
me
something
and
i
think
to
myself
here
is
a
little
blade
of
grass
all
or
if
it
happens
to
be
a
fir
tree
i
look
at
then
maybe
the
tree
has
one
branch
that
makes
me
think
of
it
a
little
too
and
sometimes
i
meet
people
up
on
the
moors
it
happens
at
i
looked
at
her
she
stood
bending
forward
listening
i
hardly
knew
her
so
lost
in
attention
she
was
that
she
took
no
heed
of
herself
but
was
ugly
foolish
looking
her
underlip
hung
far
down
yes
yes
she
said
and
drew
herself
up
the
first
drops
of
rain
began
to
fall
it
is
raining
said
i
oh
yes
it
is
raining
she
said
and
went
away
on
the
instant
i
did
not
see
her
home
she
went
on
her
way
alone
i
hurried
up
to
the
hut
a
few
minutes
passed
it
began
to
rain
heavily
suddenly
i
heard
someone
running
after
me
i
stopped
short
and
there
was
edwarda
i
forgot
she
said
breathlessly
we
were
going
over
to
the
islands
the
drying
grounds
you
know
the
doctor
is
coming
will
you
have
time
then
yes
indeed
i
shall
have
time
i
forgot
it
she
said
again
and
smiled
as
she
went
i
noticed
her
thin
pretty
calves
they
were
wet
far
above
the
ankle
her
shoes
were
worn
through
x
there
was
another
day
which
i
remember
well
it
was
the
day
my
summer
came
the
sun
began
shining
while
it
was
still
night
and
dried
up
the
wet
ground
for
the
morning
the
air
was
soft
and
fine
after
the
last
rain
in
the
afternoon
i
went
down
to
the
quay
the
water
was
perfectly
still
we
could
hear
talking
and
laughter
away
over
at
the
island
where
men
and
girls
were
at
work
on
the
fish
it
was
a
happy
afternoon
ay
was
it
not
a
happy
afternoon
we
took
hampers
of
food
and
wine
with
us
a
big
party
we
were
in
two
boats
with
young
women
in
light
dresses
i
was
so
happy
that
i
hummed
a
tune
and
when
we
were
in
the
boat
i
fell
to
thinking
where
all
these
young
people
came
from
there
were
the
daughters
of
the
lensmand
and
the
district
surgeon
a
governess
or
so
and
the
ladies
from
the
vicarage
i
had
not
seen
them
before
they
were
strangers
to
me
and
yet
for
all
that
they
were
as
friendly
as
if
we
had
known
each
other
for
years
i
made
some
mistakes
i
had
grown
unaccustomed
to
being
in
society
and
often
said
du
footnote
du
the
familiar
form
of
address
tutoyer
instead
of
de
to
the
young
ladies
but
they
did
not
seem
offended
and
once
i
said
dear
or
my
dear
but
they
forgave
me
that
as
well
and
took
no
notice
of
it
herr
mack
had
his
unstarched
shirt
front
on
as
usual
with
the
diamond
stud
he
seemed
in
excellent
spirits
and
called
across
to
the
other
boat
hi
look
after
the
hamper
with
the
bottles
you
madcaps
there
doctor
i
shall
hold
you
responsible
for
the
right
cried
the
doctor
and
just
those
few
words
from
one
boat
to
another
seemed
to
me
pleasant
and
merry
to
hear
edwarda
was
wearing
the
same
dress
she
had
worn
the
day
before
as
if
she
had
no
other
or
did
not
care
to
put
on
another
her
shoes
too
were
the
same
i
fancied
her
hands
were
not
quite
clean
but
she
wore
a
brand
new
hat
with
feathers
she
had
taken
her
dyed
jacket
with
her
and
used
it
to
sit
on
at
herr
mack
request
i
fired
a
shot
just
as
we
were
about
to
land
in
fact
two
shots
both
barrels
and
they
cheered
we
rambled
up
over
the
island
the
workers
greeted
us
all
and
herr
mack
stopped
to
speak
to
his
folk
we
found
daisies
and
corn
marigolds
and
put
them
in
our
some
found
harebells
and
there
was
a
host
of
seabirds
chattering
and
screaming
in
the
air
and
on
the
shore
we
camped
out
on
a
patch
of
grass
where
there
were
a
few
stunted
birches
with
white
stems
the
hampers
were
opened
and
herr
mack
saw
to
the
bottles
light
dresses
blue
eyes
the
ring
of
glasses
the
sea
the
white
sails
and
we
sang
a
little
and
cheeks
were
flushed
an
hour
later
my
whole
being
was
joy
even
little
things
affected
me
a
veil
fluttering
from
a
hat
a
girl
hair
coming
down
a
pair
of
eyes
closing
in
a
laugh
and
it
touched
me
that
day
that
day
i
heard
you
such
a
queer
little
hut
up
there
lieutenant
yes
a
nest
and
the
very
thing
for
me
come
and
see
me
there
one
day
there
no
such
hut
anywhere
else
and
the
great
forest
behind
another
came
up
and
said
kindly
you
have
not
been
up
here
in
the
north
before
no
i
answered
but
i
know
all
about
it
already
ladies
at
night
i
am
face
to
face
with
the
mountains
the
earth
and
the
sun
but
i
will
not
try
to
use
fine
words
what
a
summer
you
have
here
it
bursts
forth
one
night
when
everyone
is
asleep
and
in
the
morning
there
it
is
i
looked
out
of
my
window
and
saw
it
myself
i
have
two
little
a
third
came
up
she
was
charming
by
reason
of
her
voice
and
her
small
hands
how
charming
they
all
were
this
one
said
shall
we
change
flowers
it
brings
luck
they
yes
i
answered
holding
out
my
hand
let
us
change
flowers
and
i
thank
you
for
it
how
pretty
you
are

have
a
lovely
voice
i
have
been
listening
to
it
all
the
but
she
drew
back
her
harebells
and
said
curtly
what
are
you
thinking
about
it
was
not
you
i
it
was
not
me
she
meant
it
hurt
me
to
feel
that
i
had
been
mistaken
i
wished
myself
at
home
again
far
away
in
my
hut
where
only
the
wind
could
speak
to
me
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
forgive
the
other
ladies
looked
at
one
another
and
moved
away
so
as
not
to
humiliate
me
just
at
that
moment
someone
came
quickly
over
towards
us
all
could
see
her
it
was
edwarda
she
came
straight
to
me
she
said
something
and
threw
her
arms
round
my
neck
clasped
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
kissed
me
again
and
again
on
the
lips
each
time
she
said
something
but
i
did
not
hear
what
it
was
i
could
not
understand
it
all
my
heart
stood
still
i
had
only
a
feeling
of
her
burning
look
then
she
slipped
away
from
me
her
little
breast
beat
up
and
down
she
stood
there
still
with
her
brown
face
and
brown
neck
tall
and
slender
with
flashing
eyes
altogether
heedless
they
were
all
looking
at
her
for
the
second
time
i
was
fascinated
by
her
dark
eyebrows
that
curved
high
up
into
her
forehead
but
heavens
the
girl
had
kissed
me
openly
in
sight
of
them
all
what
is
it
edwarda
i
asked
and
i
could
hear
my
blood
beating
hear
it
as
it
were
from
down
in
my
throat
so
that
i
could
not
speak
distinctly
nothing
she
answered
only
that
i
wanted
to
it
does
i
took
off
my
cap
and
brushed
back
my
hair
mechanically
as
i
stood
looking
at
her
does
matter
herr
mack
was
saying
something
a
good
way
off
we
could
not
hear
his
words
from
where
we
were
but
i
was
glad
to
think
that
herr
mack
had
seen
nothing
that
he
knew
nothing
of
this
it
was
well
indeed
that
he
had
been
away
from
the
party
just
then
i
felt
relieved
at
that
and
i
stepped
over
to
the
others
and
said
with
a
laugh
and
seeming
quite
indifferent
i
would
ask
you
all
to
forgive
my
unseemly
behavior
a
moment
ago
i
am
myself
extremely
sorry
about
it
edwarda
kindly
offered
to
change
flowers
with
me
and
i
forgot
myself
i
beg
her
pardon
and
yours
put
yourself
in
my
place
i
live
all
alone
and
am
not
accustomed
to
the
society
of
ladies
besides
which
i
have
been
drinking
wine
and
am
not
used
to
that
either
you
must
make
allowances
for
and
i
laughed
and
showed
great
indifference
to
such
a
trifle
that
it
might
be
forgotten
but
inwardly
i
was
serious
moreover
what
i
had
said
made
no
impression
on
edwarda
she
did
not
try
to
hide
anything
to
smooth
over
the
effect
of
her
hasty
action
on
the
contrary
she
sat
down
close
to
me
and
kept
looking
at
me
fixedly
now
and
again
she
spoke
to
me
and
afterwards
when
we
were
playing
she
said
i
shall
have
lieutenant
glahn
i
do
care
to
run
after
anyone
for
footnote
expletive
equivalent
to
the
devil
or
damnation
girl
be
quiet
i
whispered
stamping
my
foot
she
gave
me
a
look
of
surprise
made
a
wry
face
as
if
it
hurt
and
then
smiled
bashfully
i
was
deeply
moved
at
that
the
helpless
look
in
her
eyes
and
her
little
thin
figure
were
more
than
i
could
resist
i
was
drawn
to
her
in
that
moment
and
i
took
her
long
slight
hand
in
mine
afterwards
i
said
no
more
now
we
can
meet
again
xi
in
the
night
i
heard
æsop
get
up
from
his
corner
and
growl
i
heard
it
through
my
sleep
but
i
was
dreaming
just
then
of
shooting
the
growl
of
the
dog
fitted
into
the
dream
and
it
did
not
wake
me
quite
when
i
stepped
out
of
the
hut
next
morning
there
were
tracks
in
the
grass
of
a
pair
of
human
feet
someone
had
been
there
had
gone
first
to
one
of
my
windows
then
to
the
other
the
tracks
were
lost
again
down
on
the
road
she
came
towards
me
with
hot
cheeks
with
a
face
all
beaming
have
you
been
waiting
she
said
i
was
afraid
you
would
have
to
i
had
not
been
waiting
she
was
on
the
way
before
me
have
you
slept
well
i
asked
i
hardly
knew
what
to
say
no
i
have
i
have
been
awake
she
answered
and
she
told
me
she
had
not
slept
that
night
but
had
sat
in
a
chair
with
her
eyes
closed
and
she
had
been
out
of
the
house
for
a
little
walk
someone
was
outside
my
hut
last
night
i
said
i
saw
tracks
in
the
grass
this
and
her
face
colored
she
took
my
hand
there
on
the
road
and
made
no
answer
i
looked
at
her
and
said
was
it
you
i
wonder
yes
she
answered
pressing
close
to
me
it
was
i
hope
i
wake
you
i
stepped
as
quietly
as
i
could
yes
it
was
i
was
near
you
again
i
am
fond
of
you
xii
every
day
every
day
i
met
her
i
will
tell
the
truth
i
was
glad
to
meet
her
aye
my
heart
flew
it
is
two
years
ago
this
year
now
i
think
of
it
only
when
i
please
the
whole
story
just
amuses
and
distracts
me
and
as
for
the
two
green
feathers
i
will
tell
about
them
in
good
time
there
were
several
places
where
we
could
meet
at
the
mill
on
the
road
even
in
my
hut
she
came
wherever
i
would
goddag
she
cried
always
first
and
i
answered
goddag
you
are
happy
she
says
and
her
eyes
sparkle
yes
i
am
happy
i
answer
there
is
a
speck
there
on
your
shoulder
it
is
dust
perhaps
a
speck
of
mud
from
the
road
i
must
kiss
that
little
spot
no
let
me
i
will
everything
about
you
stirs
me
so
i
am
half
out
of
my
senses
i
did
not
sleep
last
and
that
was
true
many
a
night
i
lay
and
could
not
sleep
we
walk
side
by
side
along
the
road
what
do
you
think
am
i
as
you
like
me
to
be
she
asks
perhaps
i
talk
too
much
no
oh
but
you
must
say
what
you
really
think
sometimes
i
think
to
myself
this
can
never
come
to
any
good
what
can
never
come
to
any
good
i
ask
this
between
us
that
it
can
not
come
to
any
good
you
may
believe
it
or
not
but
i
am
shivering
now
with
cold
i
feel
icy
cold
the
moment
i
come
to
you
just
out
of
it
is
the
same
with
me
i
answer
i
feel
a
shiver
too
when
i
see
you
but
it
will
come
to
some
good
all
the
same
and
anyhow
let
me
pat
you
on
the
back
to
warm
and
she
lets
me
half
unwillingly
and
then
i
hit
a
little
harder
for
a
jest
and
laugh
and
ask
if
that
does
make
her
feel
better
oh
please
do
when
i
ask
you
says
she
those
few
words
there
was
something
so
helpless
about
her
saying
it
so
the
wrong
way
round
please
do
when
i
ask
then
we
went
on
along
the
road
again
was
she
displeased
with
me
for
my
jest
i
wondered
and
thought
to
myself
well
let
us
see
and
i
said
i
just
happened
to
think
of
something
once
when
i
was
out
on
a
sledge
party
there
was
a
young
lady
who
took
a
silk
kerchief
from
her
neck
and
fastened
it
round
mine
in
the
evening
i
said
to
her
shall
have
your
kerchief
again
i
will
have
it
washed
she
said
it
to
me
now
i
will
keep
it
just
as
it
is
after
you
have
worn
it
and
i
gave
it
to
her
three
years
after
i
met
the
same
young
lady
again
kerchief
i
said
and
she
brought
it
out
it
lay
in
a
paper
just
as
before
i
saw
it
edwarda
glanced
up
at
me
yes
and
what
then
that
is
all
i
said
there
was
nothing
more
but
i
thought
it
was
nice
of
pause
where
is
that
lady
now
we
spoke
no
more
of
that
but
when
it
was
time
for
her
to
go
home
she
said
well
but
you
wo
go
thinking
of
that
lady
any
more
will
you
i
do
think
of
anyone
but
i
believed
her
i
saw
that
she
meant
what
she
said
and
it
was
more
than
enough
for
me
that
she
thought
of
no
one
else
i
walked
after
her
thank
you
edwarda
i
said
and
then
i
added
with
all
my
heart
you
are
all
too
good
for
me
but
i
am
thankful
that
you
will
have
me
god
will
reward
you
for
that
i
not
so
fine
as
many
you
could
have
no
doubt
but
i
am
all
yours
so
endlessly
yours
by
my
eternal
what
are
you
thinking
of
now
to
bring
tears
to
your
eyes
it
was
nothing
she
answered
it
sounded
so
strange
that
god
would
reward
me
for
that
you
say
things
that
i
oh
i
love
you
so
and
all
at
once
she
threw
her
arms
round
my
neck
there
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
kissed
me
when
she
had
gone
i
stepped
aside
into
the
woods
to
hide
to
be
alone
with
my
happiness
and
then
i
hurried
eagerly
back
to
the
road
to
see
if
anyone
had
noticed
that
i
had
gone
in
there
but
i
saw
no
one
xiii
summer
nights
and
still
water
and
the
woods
endlessly
still
no
cry
no
footsteps
from
the
road
my
heart
seemed
full
as
with
dark
wine
moths
and
came
flying
noiselessly
in
through
my
window
lured
by
the
glow
from
the
hearth
and
the
smell
of
the
bird
i
had
just
cooked
they
dashed
against
the
roof
with
a
dull
sound
fluttered
past
my
ears
sending
a
cold
shiver
through
me
and
settled
on
my
white
on
the
wall
i
watched
them
they
sat
trembling
and
looked
at
me
moths
and
spinners
and
burrowing
things
some
of
them
looked
like
pansies
on
the
wing
i
stepped
outside
the
hut
and
listened
nothing
no
noise
all
was
asleep
the
air
was
alight
with
flying
insects
myriads
of
buzzing
wings
out
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
were
ferns
and
aconite
the
trailing
arbutus
was
in
bloom
and
i
loved
its
tiny
flowers
thanks
my
god
for
every
heather
bloom
i
have
ever
seen
they
have
been
like
small
roses
on
my
way
and
i
weep
for
love
of
them
somewhere
near
were
wild
carnations
i
could
not
see
them
but
i
could
mark
their
scent
but
now
in
the
night
hours
great
white
flowers
have
opened
suddenly
their
chalices
are
spread
wide
they
are
breathing
and
furry
twilight
moths
slip
down
into
their
petals
making
the
whole
plant
quiver
i
go
from
one
flower
to
another
they
are
drunken
flowers
i
mark
the
stages
of
their
intoxication
light
footsteps
a
human
breathing
a
happy
and
i
answer
and
throw
myself
down
on
the
road
edwarda
i
say
again
worn
out
with
joy
that
you
should
care
for
me
so
she
whispers
and
i
answered
her
if
you
knew
how
grateful
i
can
be
you
are
mine
and
my
heart
lies
still
within
me
all
the
day
thinking
of
you
you
are
the
loveliest
girl
on
earth
and
i
have
kissed
you
often
i
go
red
with
joy
only
to
think
that
i
have
kissed
why
are
you
so
fond
of
me
this
evening
she
asks
i
was
that
for
endless
reasons
i
needed
only
to
think
of
her
to
feel
so
that
look
of
hers
from
under
the
brows
and
her
rich
dark
skin
should
i
not
be
fond
of
you
i
say
again
i
thank
every
tree
in
my
path
because
you
are
well
and
strong
once
at
a
dance
there
was
a
young
lady
who
sat
out
dance
after
dance
and
they
let
her
sit
there
alone
i
did
know
her
but
her
face
touched
me
and
i
bowed
to
her
well
but
no
she
shook
her
head
would
she
not
dance
i
asked
her
you
imagine
it
she
said
father
was
a
handsome
man
and
my
mother
a
perfect
beauty
and
my
father
won
her
by
storm
but
i
was
born
lame
edwarda
looked
at
me
let
us
sit
down
she
said
and
we
sat
down
in
the
heather
do
you
know
what
my
friend
says
about
you
she
began
your
eyes
are
like
an
animal
she
says
and
when
you
look
at
her
it
makes
her
mad
it
is
just
as
if
you
touched
her
she
a
strange
joy
thrilled
me
when
i
heard
that
not
for
my
own
sake
but
for
edwarda
and
i
thought
to
myself
there
is
only
one
whom
i
care
for
what
does
that
one
say
of
the
look
in
my
eyes
and
i
asked
her
who
was
that
your
friend
i
will
not
tell
you
she
said
but
it
was
one
of
those
that
were
out
on
the
island
that
very
well
and
then
we
spoke
of
other
things
my
father
is
going
to
russia
in
a
few
days
she
said
and
i
am
going
to
have
a
party
have
you
been
out
to
korholmerne
we
must
have
two
hampers
of
wine
the
ladies
from
the
vicarage
are
coming
again
and
father
has
already
given
me
the
wine
and
you
wo
look
at
her
again
will
you
my
friend
i
mean
please
you
wo
you
or
i
shall
not
ask
her
at
and
with
no
more
words
she
threw
herself
passionately
about
my
neck
and
looked
at
me
gazing
into
my
face
and
breathing
heavily
her
glance
was
sheer
blackness
i
got
up
abruptly
and
in
my
confusion
could
only
say
so
your
father
is
going
to
russia
what
did
you
get
up
like
that
for
so
quickly
she
asked
because
it
is
late
edwarda
i
said
now
the
white
flowers
are
closing
again
the
sun
is
getting
up
it
will
soon
be
i
went
with
her
through
the
woodland
and
stood
watching
her
as
long
as
i
could
far
down
she
turned
round
and
softly
called
then
she
disappeared
at
the
same
moment
the
door
of
the
blacksmith
house
opened
a
man
with
a
white
shirt
front
came
out
looked
round
pulled
his
hat
down
farther
over
his
forehead
and
took
the
road
down
to
sirilund
edwarda
was
still
in
my
ears
xiv
a
man
can
be
drunk
with
joy
i
fire
off
my
gun
and
an
unforgettable
echo
answers
from
hill
to
hill
floats
out
over
the
sea
and
rings
in
some
sleepy
helmsman
ears
and
what
have
i
to
be
joyful
about
a
thought
that
came
to
me
a
memory
a
sound
in
the
woods
a
human
being
i
think
of
her
i
close
my
eyes
and
stand
still
there
on
the
road
and
think
of
her
i
count
the
minutes
now
i
am
thirsty
and
drink
from
the
stream
now
i
walk
a
hundred
paces
forward
and
a
hundred
paces
back
it
must
be
late
by
now
i
say
to
myself
can
there
be
anything
wrong
a
month
has
passed
and
a
month
is
no
long
time
there
is
nothing
wrong
heaven
knows
this
month
has
been
short
but
the
nights
are
often
long
and
i
am
driven
to
wet
my
cap
in
the
stream
and
let
it
dry
only
to
pass
the
time
while
i
am
waiting
i
reckoned
my
time
by
nights
sometimes
there
would
be
an
evening
when
edwarda
did
not
come
once
she
stayed
away
two
evenings
nothing
wrong
no
but
i
felt
then
that
perhaps
my
happiness
had
reached
and
passed
its
height
and
had
it
not
can
you
hear
edwarda
how
restless
it
is
in
the
woods
rustling
incessantly
in
the
undergrowth
and
the
big
leaves
trembling
something
brewing
maybe
but
it
was
not
that
i
had
in
mind
to
say
i
hear
a
bird
away
up
on
the
hill
only
a
tomtit
but
it
has
sat
there
calling
in
the
same
place
two
nights
now
can
you
hear
the
same
same
note
again
yes
i
hear
it
why
do
you
ask
me
that
oh
for
no
reason
at
all
it
has
been
there
two
nights
now
that
was
all
thanks
thanks
for
coming
this
evening
love
i
sat
here
expecting
you
this
evening
or
the
next
looking
forward
to
it
when
you
and
i
have
been
waiting
too
i
think
of
you
and
i
have
picked
up
the
pieces
of
the
glass
you
upset
once
and
kept
them
do
you
remember
father
went
away
last
night
i
could
not
come
there
was
so
much
to
do
with
the
packing
and
reminding
him
of
things
i
knew
you
were
waiting
here
in
the
woods
and
i
cried
and
went
on
but
it
is
two
evenings
i
thought
to
myself
what
was
she
doing
the
first
evening
and
why
is
there
less
joy
in
her
eyes
now
than
before
an
hour
passed
the
bird
up
in
the
hills
was
silent
the
woods
lay
dead
no
no
nothing
wrong
all
as
before
she
gave
me
her
hand
to
say
and
looked
at
me
with
love
in
her
eyes
i
said
no
not
she
answered
i
did
not
ask
her
why
is
our
party
she
said
with
a
laugh
i
was
only
going
to
surprise
you
but
you
looked
so
miserable
i
had
to
tell
you
at
once
i
was
going
to
send
you
an
invitation
all
on
and
my
heart
was
lightened
unspeakably
she
went
off
nodding
farewell
one
thing
more
said
i
standing
where
i
was
how
long
is
it
since
you
gathered
up
the
pieces
of
that
glass
and
put
them
away
why
a
week
ago
perhaps
or
a
fortnight
yes
perhaps
a
fortnight
but
why
do
you
ask
well
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
it
was
yesterday
no
longer
ago
than
yesterday
she
had
thought
of
me
all
was
well
again
now
xv
the
two
boats
lay
ready
and
we
stepped
on
board
talking
and
singing
the
place
korholmerne
lay
out
beyond
the
islands
it
took
a
good
while
to
row
across
and
on
the
way
we
talked
one
party
with
another
from
boat
to
boat
the
doctor
wore
light
things
as
the
ladies
did
i
had
never
seen
him
so
pleased
before
he
talked
with
the
rest
instead
of
listening
in
silence
i
had
an
idea
he
had
been
drinking
a
little
and
so
was
in
good
humor
when
we
landed
he
craved
the
attention
of
the
party
for
a
moment
and
bade
us
welcome
i
thought
to
myself
this
means
that
edwarda
has
asked
him
to
act
as
host
he
fell
to
entertaining
the
ladies
in
the
most
amiable
manner
to
edwarda
he
was
polite
and
kind
often
fatherly
and
pedantically
instructive
as
he
had
been
so
many
times
before
she
spoke
of
some
date
or
other
saying
i
was
born
in
and
he
asked
eighteen
hundred
and
i
suppose
you
mean
and
if
she
had
answered
no
in
nineteen
hundred
and
he
would
have
shown
no
embarrassment
but
only
corrected
her
again
and
said
i
think
you
must
be
when
i
said
anything
myself
he
listened
politely
and
attentively
and
did
not
ignore
me
a
young
girl
came
up
to
me
with
a
greeting
i
did
not
recognize
her
i
could
not
remember
her
at
all
and
i
said
a
few
words
in
surprise
and
she
laughed
it
was
one
of
the
dean
daughters
i
had
met
her
the
day
we
went
to
the
island
before
and
had
invited
her
to
my
hut
we
talked
together
a
little
an
hour
or
so
passed
by
i
was
feeling
dull
and
drank
from
the
wine
poured
out
for
me
and
mixed
with
the
others
chatting
with
them
all
again
i
made
a
mistake
here
and
there
i
was
on
doubtful
ground
and
could
not
tell
at
the
moment
how
to
answer
any
little
civility
now
and
then
i
talked
incoherently
or
even
found
nothing
at
all
to
say
and
this
troubled
me
over
by
the
big
rock
which
we
were
using
as
a
table
sat
the
doctor
gesticulating
soul
what
is
the
soul
he
was
saying
the
dean
daughter
had
accused
him
of
being
a
well
and
should
not
a
man
think
freely
people
imagined
hell
as
a
sort
of
house
down
under
the
ground
with
the
devil
as
host
or
rather
as
sovereign
lord
then
he
spoke
of
the
altar
picture
in
the
chapel
a
figure
of
the
christ
with
a
few
jews
and
jewesses
water
into
wine
well
and
good
but
christ
had
a
halo
round
his
head
and
what
was
a
halo
simply
a
yellow
hoop
fixed
on
three
hairs
two
of
the
ladies
clasped
their
hands
aghast
but
the
doctor
extricated
himself
and
said
jestingly
sounds
horrible
does
it
i
admit
it
but
if
you
repeat
it
and
repeat
it
again
to
yourself
seven
or
eight
times
and
then
think
it
over
a
little
it
soon
sounds
easier
ladies
your
very
good
health
and
he
knelt
on
the
grass
before
the
two
ladies
and
instead
of
taking
his
hat
off
and
laying
it
before
him
he
held
it
straight
up
in
the
air
with
one
hand
and
emptied
his
glass
with
his
head
bent
back
i
was
altogether
carried
away
by
his
wonderful
ease
of
manner
and
would
have
drunk
with
him
myself
but
that
his
glass
was
empty
edwarda
was
following
him
with
her
eyes
i
placed
myself
near
her
and
said
shall
we
play
she
started
slightly
and
got
up
be
careful
not
to
say
to
each
other
now
she
whispered
now
i
had
not
said
at
all
i
walked
away
another
hour
passed
the
day
was
getting
long
i
would
have
rowed
home
alone
long
before
if
there
had
been
a
third
boat
æsop
lay
tied
up
in
the
hut
and
perhaps
he
was
thinking
of
me
edwarda
thoughts
must
surely
be
far
away
from
me
she
talked
of
how
lovely
it
would
be
to
travel
and
see
strange
places
her
cheeks
flushed
at
the
thought
and
she
even
stumbled
in
her
speech
no
one
could
be
more
happier
than
i
the
day
happier
said
the
doctor
what
said
she
happier
i
do
you
said
happier
i
did
i
i
sorry
no
one
could
be
happier
than
i
the
day
i
stood
on
board
the
ship
sometimes
i
long
for
places
i
do
not
know
she
longed
to
be
away
she
did
not
think
of
me
i
stood
there
and
read
in
her
face
that
she
had
forgotten
me
well
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
but
i
stood
there
myself
and
saw
it
in
her
face
and
the
minutes
dragged
so
miserably
slowly
by
i
asked
several
of
the
others
if
we
ought
not
to
row
back
now
it
was
getting
late
i
said
and
æsop
was
tied
up
in
the
hut
but
none
of
them
wanted
to
go
back
i
went
over
again
to
the
dean
daughter
for
the
third
time
i
thought
she
must
be
the
one
that
had
said
i
had
eyes
like
an
animal
we
drank
together
she
had
quivering
eyes
they
were
never
still
she
kept
looking
at
me
and
then
looking
away
all
the
time
fröken
i
said
do
you
not
think
people
here
in
these
parts
are
like
the
short
summer
itself
in
their
feeling
i
mean
beautiful
but
lasting
only
a
little
while
i
spoke
loudly
very
loudly
and
i
did
so
on
purpose
and
i
went
on
speaking
loudly
and
asked
that
young
lady
once
more
if
she
would
not
like
to
come
up
one
day
and
see
my
hut
heaven
bless
you
for
it
i
said
in
my
distress
and
i
was
already
thinking
to
myself
how
perhaps
i
might
find
something
to
give
her
as
a
present
if
she
came
perhaps
i
had
nothing
to
give
her
but
my
i
thought
and
she
promised
to
come
edwarda
sat
with
her
face
turned
away
and
let
me
talk
as
much
as
i
pleased
she
listened
to
what
the
others
said
putting
in
a
word
herself
now
and
again
the
doctor
told
the
young
ladies
fortunes
by
their
hands
and
talked
a
lot
he
himself
had
small
delicate
hands
with
a
ring
on
one
finger
i
felt
myself
unwanted
and
sat
down
by
myself
awhile
on
a
stone
it
was
getting
late
in
the
afternoon
here
i
am
i
said
to
myself
sitting
all
alone
on
a
stone
and
the
only
creature
that
could
make
me
move
she
lets
me
sit
well
then
i
care
no
more
than
she
a
great
feeling
of
forsakenness
came
over
me
i
could
hear
them
talking
behind
me
and
i
heard
how
edwarda
laughed
and
at
that
i
got
up
suddenly
and
went
over
to
the
party
my
excitement
ran
away
with
me
just
a
moment
i
said
it
occurred
to
me
while
i
was
sitting
there
that
perhaps
you
might
like
to
see
my
and
i
took
it
out
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
think
of
it
before
just
look
through
it
if
you
please
i
should
be
only
too
delighted
you
must
all
see
it
there
are
both
red
and
yellow
flies
in
and
i
held
my
cap
in
my
hand
as
i
spoke
i
was
myself
aware
that
i
had
taken
off
my
cap
and
i
knew
that
this
was
wrong
so
i
put
it
on
again
at
once
there
was
deep
silence
for
a
moment
and
no
one
offered
to
take
the
book
at
last
the
doctor
reached
out
his
hand
for
it
and
said
politely
thanks
very
much
let
us
look
at
the
things
it
always
been
a
marvel
to
me
how
those
flies
were
put
i
make
them
myself
i
said
full
of
gratitude
and
i
went
on
at
once
to
explain
how
it
was
done
it
was
simple
enough
i
bought
the
feathers
and
the
hooks
they
were
not
well
made
but
they
were
only
for
my
own
use
one
could
get
flies
in
the
shops
and
they
were
beautiful
things
edwarda
cast
one
careless
glance
at
me
and
my
book
and
went
on
talking
with
her
girl
friends
ah
here
are
some
of
the
feathers
said
the
doctor
look
these
are
really
edwarda
looked
up
the
green
ones
are
pretty
she
said
let
me
look
keep
them
i
cried
yes
do
i
beg
you
now
two
green
feathers
do
as
a
kindness
let
them
be
a
she
looked
at
them
and
said
they
are
green
and
gold
as
you
turn
them
in
the
sun
thank
you
if
you
will
give
me
i
should
be
glad
to
i
said
and
she
took
the
feathers
a
little
later
the
doctor
handed
me
the
book
and
thanked
me
then
he
got
up
and
asked
if
it
were
not
nearly
time
to
be
getting
back
i
said
yes
for
heaven
sake
i
have
a
dog
tied
up
at
home
look
you
i
have
a
dog
and
he
is
my
friend
he
lies
there
thinking
of
me
and
when
i
come
home
he
stands
with
his
forepaws
at
the
window
to
greet
me
it
has
been
a
lovely
day
and
now
it
is
nearly
over
let
us
go
back
i
am
grateful
to
you
i
waited
on
the
shore
to
see
which
boat
edwarda
chose
and
made
up
my
mind
to
go
in
the
other
one
myself
suddenly
she
called
me
i
looked
at
her
in
surprise
her
face
was
flushed
then
she
came
up
to
me
held
out
her
hand
and
said
tenderly
thank
you
for
the
feathers
you
will
come
in
the
boat
with
me
you
if
you
wish
it
i
said
we
got
into
the
boat
and
she
sat
down
beside
me
on
the
same
seat
her
knee
touching
mine
i
looked
at
her
and
she
glanced
at
me
for
a
moment
in
return
i
began
to
feel
myself
repaid
for
that
bitter
day
and
was
growing
happy
again
when
she
suddenly
changed
her
position
turned
her
back
to
me
and
began
talking
to
the
doctor
who
was
sitting
at
the
rudder
for
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
i
did
not
exist
for
her
then
i
did
something
i
repent
of
and
have
not
yet
forgotten
her
shoe
fell
off
i
snatched
it
up
and
flung
it
far
out
into
the
water
for
pure
joy
that
she
was
near
or
from
some
impulse
to
make
myself
remarked
to
remind
her
of
my
existence
i
do
not
know
it
all
happened
so
suddenly
i
did
not
think
only
felt
that
impulse
the
ladies
set
up
a
cry
i
myself
was
as
if
paralyzed
by
what
i
had
done
but
what
was
the
good
of
that
it
was
done
the
doctor
came
to
my
help
he
cried
row
and
steered
towards
the
shoe
and
the
next
moment
the
boatman
had
caught
hold
of
the
shoe
just
as
it
had
filled
with
water
and
was
sinking
the
man
arm
was
wet
up
to
the
elbow
then
there
was
a
shout
of
hurra
from
many
in
the
boats
because
the
shoe
was
saved
i
was
deeply
ashamed
and
felt
that
my
face
changed
color
and
winced
as
i
wiped
the
shoe
with
my
handkerchief
edwarda
took
it
without
a
word
not
till
a
little
while
after
did
she
say
i
never
saw
such
a
thing
no
did
you
ever
i
said
and
i
smiled
and
pulled
myself
together
making
as
if
i
had
played
that
trick
for
some
particular
reason
as
if
there
were
something
behind
it
but
what
could
there
be
the
doctor
looked
at
me
for
the
first
time
contemptuously
a
little
time
passed
the
boats
glided
homeward
the
feeling
of
awkwardness
among
the
party
disappeared
we
sang
we
were
nearing
the
land
edwarda
said
oh
we
have
finished
the
wine
there
is
ever
so
much
left
we
must
have
another
party
a
new
party
later
on
we
must
have
a
dance
a
ball
in
the
big
when
we
went
ashore
i
made
an
apology
to
edwarda
if
you
knew
how
i
wished
myself
back
in
my
hut
i
said
this
has
been
a
long
and
painful
has
it
been
a
painful
day
for
you
lieutenant
i
mean
said
i
trying
to
pass
it
off
i
mean
i
have
caused
unpleasantness
both
to
myself
and
others
i
threw
your
shoe
into
the
yes
an
extraordinary
thing
to
forgive
me
i
said
xvi
what
worse
things
might
still
happen
i
resolved
to
keep
calm
whatever
might
come
heaven
is
my
witness
was
it
i
who
had
forced
myself
on
her
from
the
first
no
no
never
i
was
but
standing
in
her
way
one
as
she
passed
what
a
summer
it
was
here
in
the
north
already
the
cockchafers
had
ceased
to
fly
and
people
were
grown
more
and
more
difficult
to
understand
for
all
that
the
sun
shone
on
them
day
and
night
what
were
their
blue
eyes
looking
for
and
what
were
they
thinking
behind
their
mysterious
lashes
well
after
all
they
were
all
equally
indifferent
to
me
i
took
out
my
lines
and
went
fishing
for
two
days
four
days
but
at
night
i
lay
with
open
eyes
in
the
hut
edwarda
i
have
not
seen
you
for
four
four
days
yes
so
it
is
oh
but
i
have
been
so
busy
come
and
she
led
me
into
the
big
room
the
tables
had
been
moved
out
the
chairs
set
round
the
walls
everything
shifted
the
chandelier
the
stove
and
the
walls
were
fantastically
decorated
with
heather
and
black
stuff
from
the
store
the
piano
stood
in
one
corner
these
were
her
preparations
for
the
what
do
you
think
of
it
she
asked
wonderful
i
said
we
went
out
of
the
room
i
said
listen
edwarda
have
you
quite
forgotten
me
i
ca
understand
you
she
answered
in
surprise
you
saw
all
i
had
been
doing
how
could
i
come
and
see
you
at
the
same
time
no
i
agreed
perhaps
you
i
was
sick
and
exhausted
with
want
of
sleep
my
speech
grew
meaningless
and
uncontrolled
i
had
been
miserable
the
whole
day
no
of
course
you
could
not
come
but
i
was
going
to
say
in
a
word
something
has
changed
there
is
something
wrong
yes
but
i
can
not
read
in
your
face
what
it
is
there
is
something
very
strange
about
your
brow
edwarda
yes
i
can
see
it
but
i
have
not
forgotten
you
she
cried
blushing
and
slipped
her
arm
suddenly
into
mine
no
well
perhaps
you
have
not
forgotten
me
but
if
so
then
i
do
not
know
what
i
am
saying
one
or
the
you
shall
have
an
invitation
you
must
dance
with
me
oh
how
we
will
dance
will
you
go
a
little
way
with
me
i
asked
now
no
i
ca
she
answered
the
doctor
will
be
here
presently
he
going
to
help
me
with
something
there
is
a
good
deal
still
to
be
done
and
you
think
the
room
will
look
all
right
as
it
is
but
do
you
think
a
carriage
stops
outside
is
the
doctor
driving
i
ask
yes
i
sent
a
horse
for
him
i
wanted
to
spare
his
bad
foot
yes
well
i
must
be
off
doctor
pleased
to
see
you
again
well
and
fit
i
hope
excuse
my
running
off
once
down
the
steps
outside
i
turned
round
edwarda
was
standing
at
the
window
watching
me
she
stood
holding
the
curtains
aside
with
both
hands
to
see
and
her
look
was
thoughtful
a
foolish
joy
thrilled
me
i
hurried
away
from
the
house
with
a
darkness
shading
my
eyes
my
gun
was
light
as
a
in
my
hand
if
i
could
win
her
i
should
become
a
good
man
i
thought
i
reached
the
woods
and
thought
again
if
i
might
win
her
i
would
serve
her
more
untiringly
than
any
other
and
even
if
she
proved
unworthy
if
she
took
a
fancy
to
demand
impossibilities
i
would
yet
do
all
that
i
could
and
be
glad
that
she
was
mine
i
stopped
fell
on
my
knees
and
in
humility
and
hope
licked
a
few
blades
of
grass
by
the
roadside
and
then
got
up
again
at
last
i
began
to
feel
almost
sure
her
altered
behavior
of
late
it
was
only
her
manner
she
had
stood
looking
after
me
when
i
went
stood
at
the
window
following
with
her
eyes
till
i
disappeared
what
more
could
she
do
my
delight
upset
me
altogether
i
was
hungry
and
no
longer
felt
it
æsop
ran
on
ahead
a
moment
afterward
he
began
to
bark
i
looked
up
a
woman
with
a
white
kerchief
on
her
head
was
standing
by
the
corner
of
the
hut
it
was
eva
the
blacksmith
daughter
eva
i
called
to
her
she
stood
by
the
big
grey
stone
her
face
all
red
sucking
one
finger
is
it
you
eva
what
is
the
matter
i
asked
æsop
has
bitten
me
she
answered
with
some
awkwardness
and
cast
down
her
eyes
i
looked
at
her
finger
she
had
bitten
it
herself
a
thought
flashed
into
my
mind
and
i
asked
her
have
you
been
waiting
here
long
no
not
very
long
she
answered
and
without
a
word
more
from
either
of
us
i
took
her
by
the
hand
and
let
her
into
the
hut
xvii
i
came
from
my
fishing
as
usual
and
appeared
at
the
ball
with
the
gun
and
bag
only
i
had
put
on
my
best
leather
suit
it
was
late
when
i
got
to
sirilund
i
heard
them
dancing
inside
someone
called
out
the
hunter
the
a
few
of
the
young
people
crowded
round
me
and
wanted
to
see
my
catch
i
had
shot
a
brace
of
seabirds
and
caught
a
few
haddock
edwarda
bade
me
welcome
with
a
smile
she
had
been
dancing
and
was
flushed
the
first
dance
with
me
she
said
and
we
danced
nothing
awkward
happened
i
turned
giddy
but
did
not
fall
my
heavy
boots
made
a
certain
amount
of
noise
i
could
hear
it
myself
the
noise
and
resolved
not
to
dance
any
more
i
had
even
scratched
their
painted
floor
but
how
glad
i
was
that
i
had
done
nothing
worse
herr
mack
two
assistants
from
the
store
were
there
laboriously
and
with
a
solemn
concentration
the
doctor
took
part
eagerly
in
the
set
dances
besides
these
gentlemen
there
were
four
other
youngish
men
sons
of
families
belonging
to
the
parish
the
dean
and
the
district
surgeons
a
stranger
a
commercial
traveller
was
there
too
he
made
himself
remarked
by
his
fine
voice
and
to
the
music
now
and
again
he
relieved
the
ladies
at
the
piano
i
can
not
remember
now
what
happened
the
first
few
hours
but
i
remember
everything
from
the
latter
part
of
the
night
the
sun
shone
redly
in
through
the
windows
all
the
time
and
the
seabirds
slept
we
had
wine
and
cakes
we
talked
loud
and
sang
edwarda
laugh
sounded
fresh
and
careless
through
the
room
but
why
had
she
never
a
word
for
me
now
i
went
towards
where
she
was
sitting
and
would
have
said
something
polite
to
her
as
best
i
could
she
was
wearing
a
black
dress
her
confirmation
dress
perhaps
and
it
was
grown
too
short
for
her
but
it
suited
her
when
she
danced
and
i
thought
to
tell
her
so
that
black
dress
i
began
but
she
stood
up
put
her
arm
round
one
of
her
girl
friends
and
walked
off
with
her
this
happened
two
or
three
times
well
i
thought
to
myself
if
it
like
that
but
then
why
should
she
stand
looking
sorrowfully
after
me
from
the
window
when
i
go
well
is
her
affair
a
lady
asked
me
to
dance
edwarda
was
sitting
near
and
i
answered
loudly
no
i
am
going
home
edwarda
threw
a
questioning
glance
at
me
and
said
going
oh
no
you
must
i
started
and
felt
that
i
was
biting
my
lip
i
got
up
what
you
said
then
seemed
very
significant
to
me
edwarda
i
said
darkly
and
made
a
few
steps
towards
the
door
the
doctor
put
himself
in
my
way
and
edwarda
herself
came
hurrying
up
do
misunderstand
me
she
said
warmly
i
meant
to
say
i
hoped
you
would
be
the
last
to
go
the
very
last
and
besides
it
only
one
listen
she
went
on
with
sparkling
eyes
you
gave
our
boatmen
five
for
saving
my
shoe
it
was
too
and
she
laughed
heartily
and
turned
round
to
the
rest
i
stood
with
open
mouth
disarmed
and
confused
you
are
pleased
to
be
witty
i
said
i
never
gave
your
boatman
five
at
oh
did
you
she
opened
the
door
to
the
kitchen
and
called
the
boatmen
in
jakob
you
remember
the
day
you
rowed
us
out
to
korholmerne
and
you
picked
up
my
shoe
when
it
fell
into
the
water
yes
answered
jakob
and
you
were
given
five
for
saving
it
yes
you
gave
me
thanks
that
will
do
you
can
now
what
did
she
mean
by
that
trick
i
thought
she
was
trying
to
shame
me
she
should
not
succeed
i
was
not
going
to
have
that
to
blush
for
and
i
said
loudly
and
distinctly
i
must
point
out
to
all
here
that
this
is
either
a
mistake
or
a
lie
i
have
never
so
much
as
thought
of
giving
the
boatman
five
for
your
shoe
i
ought
to
have
done
so
perhaps
but
up
to
now
it
has
not
been
whereupon
we
shall
continue
the
dance
she
said
frowning
why
we
dancing
she
owes
me
an
explanation
of
this
i
said
to
myself
and
watched
for
an
opportunity
to
speak
with
her
she
went
into
a
side
room
and
i
followed
her
i
said
and
lifted
a
glass
to
drink
with
her
i
have
nothing
in
my
glass
she
answered
shortly
but
her
glass
was
standing
in
front
of
her
quite
full
i
thought
that
was
your
no
it
is
not
mine
she
answered
and
turned
away
and
was
in
deep
conversation
with
someone
else
i
beg
your
pardon
then
said
i
several
of
the
guests
had
noticed
this
little
scene
my
heart
was
hissing
within
me
i
said
offendedly
but
at
least
you
owe
me
an
explanation
she
rose
took
both
my
hands
and
said
earnestly
but
not
not
now
i
am
so
miserable
heavens
how
you
look
at
me
we
were
friends
once
overwhelmed
i
turned
right
about
and
went
in
to
the
dancers
again
a
little
after
edwarda
herself
came
in
and
took
up
her
place
by
the
piano
at
which
the
travelling
man
was
seated
playing
a
dance
her
face
at
that
moment
was
full
of
inward
pain
i
have
never
learned
to
play
she
said
looking
at
me
with
dark
eyes
if
i
only
could
i
could
make
no
answer
to
this
but
my
heart
flew
out
towards
her
once
more
and
i
asked
why
are
you
so
unhappy
all
at
once
edwarda
if
you
knew
how
it
hurts
me
to
see
i
do
know
what
it
is
she
said
everything
perhaps
i
wish
all
these
people
would
go
away
at
once
all
of
them
no
not
you
remember
you
must
stay
till
the
and
again
her
words
revived
me
and
my
eyes
saw
the
light
in
the
room
the
dean
daughter
came
over
and
began
talking
to
me
i
wished
her
ever
so
far
away
and
gave
her
short
answers
and
i
purposely
kept
from
looking
at
her
for
she
had
said
that
about
my
eyes
being
like
an
animal
she
turned
to
edwarda
and
told
her
that
once
somewhere
abroad
in
riga
i
think
it
was
a
man
had
followed
her
along
the
street
kept
walking
after
me
street
after
street
and
smiling
across
at
me
she
said
why
was
he
blind
then
i
broke
in
thinking
to
please
edwarda
and
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
as
well
the
young
lady
understood
my
coarseness
at
once
and
answered
he
must
have
been
blind
indeed
to
run
after
any
one
so
old
and
ugly
as
i
but
i
gained
no
thanks
from
edwarda
for
that
she
drew
her
friend
away
they
whispered
together
and
shook
their
heads
after
that
i
was
left
altogether
to
myself
another
hour
passed
the
seabirds
began
to
wake
out
on
the
reefs
their
cries
sounded
in
through
the
open
windows
a
spasm
of
joy
went
through
me
at
this
first
calling
of
the
birds
and
i
longed
to
be
out
there
on
the
islands
myself
the
doctor
once
more
in
good
humor
drew
the
attention
of
all
present
the
ladies
were
never
tired
of
his
society
is
that
thing
there
my
rival
i
thought
noting
his
lame
leg
and
miserable
figure
he
had
taken
to
a
new
and
amusing
oath
he
said
og
footnote
a
slight
variation
of
the
usual
död
og
pine
death
and
torture
and
every
time
he
used
that
comical
expression
i
laughed
aloud
in
my
misery
i
wished
to
give
the
fellow
every
advantage
i
could
since
he
was
my
rival
i
let
it
be
doctor
here
and
doctor
there
and
called
out
myself
listen
to
the
doctor
and
laughed
aloud
at
the
things
he
said
i
love
this
world
said
the
doctor
i
cling
to
life
tooth
and
nail
and
when
i
come
to
die
then
i
hope
to
find
a
corner
somewhere
straight
up
over
london
and
paris
where
i
can
hear
the
rumble
of
the
human
cancan
all
the
time
all
the
splendid
i
cried
and
choked
with
laughter
though
i
was
not
in
the
least
bit
drunk
edwarda
too
seemed
delighted
when
the
guests
began
to
go
i
slipped
away
into
the
little
room
at
the
side
and
sat
down
to
wait
i
heard
one
after
another
saying
on
the
stairs
the
doctor
also
took
his
leave
and
went
soon
all
the
voices
had
died
away
my
heart
beat
violently
as
i
waited
edwarda
came
in
again
at
sight
of
me
she
stood
a
moment
in
surprise
then
she
said
with
a
smile
oh
are
you
there
it
was
kind
of
you
to
wait
till
the
last
i
am
tired
out
she
remained
standing
i
got
up
then
and
said
you
will
be
wanting
rest
now
i
hope
you
are
not
displeased
any
more
edwarda
you
were
so
unhappy
a
while
back
and
it
hurt
it
will
be
all
right
when
i
have
i
had
no
more
to
add
i
went
towards
the
door
thank
you
she
said
offering
her
hand
it
was
a
pleasant
she
would
have
seen
me
to
the
door
but
i
tried
to
prevent
her
no
need
i
said
do
not
trouble
i
can
find
my
way
but
she
went
with
me
all
the
same
she
stood
in
the
passage
waiting
patiently
while
i
found
my
cap
my
gun
and
my
bag
there
was
a
in
the
corner
i
saw
it
well
enough
i
stared
at
it
and
recognized
it
it
was
the
doctor
when
she
marked
what
i
was
looking
at
she
blushed
in
confusion
it
was
plain
to
see
from
her
face
that
she
was
innocent
that
she
knew
nothing
of
the
stick
a
whole
minute
passed
at
last
she
turned
furiously
impatient
and
said
tremblingly
your
stick
do
not
forget
your
and
there
before
my
eyes
she
handed
me
the
doctor
stick
i
looked
at
her
she
was
still
holding
out
the
stick
her
hand
trembled
to
make
an
end
of
it
i
took
the
thing
and
set
it
back
in
the
corner
i
said
it
is
the
doctor
stick
i
can
not
understand
how
a
lame
man
could
forget
his
you
and
your
lame
man
she
cried
bitterly
and
took
a
step
forward
towards
me
you
are
not
lame
no
but
even
if
you
were
you
could
not
compare
with
him
no
you
could
never
compare
with
him
there
i
sought
for
some
answer
but
my
mind
was
suddenly
empty
i
was
silent
with
a
deep
bow
i
stepped
backwards
out
of
the
door
and
down
on
to
the
steps
there
i
stood
a
moment
looking
straight
before
me
then
i
moved
off
so
he
has
forgotten
his
stick
i
thought
to
myself
and
he
will
come
back
this
way
to
fetch
it
he
would
not
let
be
the
last
man
to
leave
the
house
i
walked
up
the
road
very
slowly
keeping
a
lookout
either
way
and
stopped
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
at
last
after
half
an
hour
waiting
the
doctor
came
walking
towards
me
he
had
seen
me
and
was
walking
quickly
before
he
had
time
to
speak
i
lifted
my
cap
to
try
him
he
raised
his
hat
in
return
i
went
straight
up
to
him
and
said
i
gave
you
no
he
came
a
step
nearer
and
stared
at
me
you
gave
me
no
greeting
no
said
i
pause
why
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
what
you
did
he
said
turning
pale
i
was
going
to
fetch
my
stick
i
left
it
i
could
say
nothing
in
answer
to
this
but
i
took
my
revenge
another
way
i
stretched
out
my
gun
before
him
as
if
he
were
a
dog
and
said
over
and
i
whistled
as
if
coaxing
him
to
jump
over
for
a
moment
he
struggled
with
himself
his
face
took
on
the
strangest
play
of
expression
as
he
pressed
his
lips
together
and
held
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
suddenly
he
looked
at
me
sharply
a
half
smile
lit
up
his
features
and
he
said
what
do
you
really
mean
by
all
this
i
did
not
answer
but
his
words
affected
me
suddenly
he
held
out
his
hand
to
me
and
said
gently
there
is
something
wrong
with
you
if
you
will
tell
me
what
it
is
then
perhaps
i
was
overwhelmed
now
with
shame
and
despair
his
calm
words
made
me
lose
my
balance
i
wished
to
show
him
some
kindness
in
return
and
i
put
my
arm
round
him
and
said
forgive
me
this
no
what
could
be
wrong
with
me
there
is
nothing
wrong
i
have
no
need
of
your
help
you
are
looking
for
edwarda
perhaps
you
will
find
her
at
home
but
make
haste
or
she
will
have
gone
to
bed
before
you
come
she
was
very
tired
i
could
see
it
myself
i
tell
you
the
best
news
i
can
now
it
is
true
you
will
find
her
at
home
go
then
and
i
turned
and
hurried
away
from
him
striking
out
with
a
long
stride
up
through
the
woods
and
back
to
the
hut
for
a
while
i
sat
there
on
the
bed
just
as
i
had
come
in
with
my
bag
over
my
shoulder
and
my
gun
in
my
hand
strange
thoughts
passed
through
my
mind
why
ever
had
i
given
myself
away
so
to
that
doctor
the
thought
that
i
had
put
my
arm
round
him
and
looked
at
him
with
wet
eyes
angered
me
he
would
chuckle
over
it
i
thought
perhaps
at
that
very
moment
he
might
be
sitting
laughing
over
it
with
edwarda
he
had
set
his
stick
aside
in
the
hall
yes
even
if
i
were
lame
i
could
not
compare
with
the
doctor
i
could
never
compare
with
him
those
were
her
words
i
stepped
out
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
cocked
my
gun
set
the
muzzle
against
my
left
instep
and
pulled
the
trigger
the
shot
passed
through
the
middle
of
the
foot
and
pierced
the
floor
æsop
gave
a
short
terrified
bark
a
little
after
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
it
was
the
doctor
sorry
to
disturb
you
he
began
you
went
off
so
suddenly
i
thought
it
might
do
no
harm
if
we
had
a
little
talk
together
smell
of
powder
is
there
he
was
perfectly
sober
did
you
see
edwarda
did
you
get
your
stick
i
asked
i
found
my
stick
but
edwarda
had
gone
to
bed
what
that
heavens
man
you
bleeding
no
nothing
to
speak
of
i
was
just
putting
the
gun
away
and
it
went
off
it
nothing
devil
take
you
am
i
obliged
to
sit
here
and
give
you
all
sorts
of
information
about
that
you
found
your
stick
but
he
did
not
heed
my
words
he
was
staring
at
my
torn
boot
and
the
trickle
of
blood
with
a
quick
movement
he
laid
down
his
stick
and
took
off
his
gloves
sit
still
i
must
get
that
boot
off
i
it
was
a
shot
i
xviii
how
i
repented
of
it
afterward
that
business
with
the
gun
it
was
a
mad
thing
to
do
it
was
not
worth
while
any
way
and
it
served
no
purpose
only
kept
me
tied
down
to
the
hut
for
weeks
i
remember
distinctly
even
now
all
the
discomfort
and
annoyance
it
caused
my
washerwoman
had
to
come
every
day
and
stay
there
nearly
all
the
time
making
purchases
of
food
looking
after
my
housekeeping
for
several
weeks
well
and
then
one
day
the
doctor
began
talking
about
edwarda
i
heard
her
name
heard
what
she
had
said
and
done
and
it
was
no
longer
of
any
great
importance
to
me
it
was
as
if
he
spoke
of
some
distant
irrelevant
thing
so
quickly
one
can
forget
i
thought
to
myself
and
wondered
at
it
well
and
what
do
you
think
of
edwarda
yourself
since
you
ask
i
have
not
thought
of
her
for
weeks
to
tell
the
truth
wait
a
bit
it
seems
to
me
there
must
have
been
something
between
you
and
her
you
were
so
often
together
you
acted
host
one
day
at
a
picnic
on
the
island
and
she
was
hostess
do
deny
it
doctor
there
was
something
a
sort
of
understanding
no
for
heaven
sake
do
answer
me
you
owe
me
no
explanation
i
am
not
asking
to
be
told
anything
at
all
let
us
talk
of
something
else
if
you
like
how
long
before
i
can
get
about
again
i
sat
there
thinking
of
what
i
had
said
why
was
i
inwardly
afraid
lest
the
doctor
should
speak
out
what
was
edwarda
to
me
i
had
forgotten
her
and
later
the
talk
turned
on
her
again
and
i
interrupted
him
once
more
god
knows
what
it
was
i
dreaded
to
hear
what
do
you
break
off
like
that
for
he
asked
is
it
that
you
bear
to
hear
me
speak
her
name
tell
me
i
said
what
is
your
honest
opinion
of
edwarda
i
should
be
interested
to
he
looked
at
me
suspiciously
my
honest
opinion
perhaps
you
may
have
something
new
to
tell
me
perhaps
you
have
proposed
and
been
accepted
may
i
congratulate
you
no
ah
the
devil
trust
you
haha
so
that
was
what
you
were
afraid
of
afraid
of
my
dear
doctor
pause
no
he
said
i
have
not
proposed
and
been
accepted
but
you
have
perhaps
there
no
proposing
to
edwarda
she
will
take
whomever
she
has
a
fancy
for
did
you
take
her
for
a
peasant
girl
you
have
met
her
and
seen
for
yourself
she
is
a
child
that
had
too
little
whipping
in
her
time
and
a
woman
of
many
moods
cold
no
fear
of
that
warm
ice
i
say
what
is
she
then
a
slip
of
a
girl
sixteen
or
seventeen
exactly
but
try
to
make
an
impression
on
that
slip
of
a
girl
and
she
will
laugh
you
to
scorn
for
your
trouble
even
her
father
can
do
nothing
with
her
she
obeys
him
outwardly
but
in
point
of
fact
is
she
herself
that
rules
she
says
you
have
eyes
like
an
animal
you
wrong
there
it
was
someone
else
said
i
had
eyes
like
an
someone
else
who
i
do
know
one
of
her
girl
friends
no
it
was
not
edwarda
said
that
wait
a
bit
though
perhaps
after
all
it
was
edwarda
when
you
look
at
her
it
makes
her
feel
so
and
so
she
says
but
do
you
think
that
brings
you
a
hairbreadth
nearer
hardly
look
at
her
use
your
eyes
as
much
as
you
please
but
as
soon
as
she
marks
what
you
are
doing
she
will
say
to
herself
here
this
man
looking
at
me
with
his
eyes
and
thinks
to
win
me
that
way
and
with
a
single
glance
or
a
word
she
have
you
ten
leagues
away
do
you
think
i
do
know
her
how
old
do
you
reckon
her
to
be
she
was
born
in
she
a
lie
i
looked
it
up
out
of
curiosity
she
twenty
though
she
might
well
pass
for
fifteen
she
is
not
happy
there
a
deal
of
conflict
in
that
little
head
of
hers
when
she
stands
looking
out
at
the
hills
and
the
sea
and
her
mouth
gives
that
little
twitch
that
little
spasm
of
pain
then
she
is
suffering
but
she
is
too
proud
too
obstinate
for
tears
she
is
more
than
a
bit
romantic
a
powerful
imagination
she
is
waiting
for
a
prince
what
was
that
about
a
certain
note
you
were
supposed
to
have
given
someone
a
jest
it
was
nothing
it
was
something
all
the
same
she
did
something
of
the
same
sort
with
me
once
it
a
year
ago
now
we
were
on
board
the
while
it
was
lying
here
in
the
harbour
it
was
raining
and
very
cold
a
woman
with
a
child
in
her
arms
was
sitting
on
deck
shivering
edwarda
asked
her
you
feel
cold
yes
she
did
the
little
one
too
yes
the
little
one
was
cold
as
well
do
you
go
into
the
cabin
asks
edwarda
only
a
steerage
ticket
says
the
woman
edwarda
looks
at
me
woman
here
has
only
a
steerage
ticket
she
says
and
what
then
i
say
to
myself
but
i
understand
her
look
i
not
a
rich
man
what
i
have
i
worked
to
earn
and
i
think
twice
before
i
spend
it
so
i
move
away
if
edwarda
wants
someone
to
pay
for
the
woman
let
her
do
it
herself
she
and
her
father
can
better
afford
it
than
i
and
sure
enough
edwarda
paid
she
splendid
in
that
way
no
one
can
say
she
has
a
heart
but
as
true
as
i
sitting
here
she
expected
me
to
pay
for
a
saloon
passage
for
the
woman
and
child
i
could
see
it
in
her
eyes
and
what
then
do
you
think
the
woman
gets
up
and
thanks
her
for
her
kindness
thank
me
it
was
that
gentleman
there
says
edwarda
pointing
to
me
as
calmly
as
could
be
what
do
you
think
of
that
the
woman
thanks
me
too
and
what
can
i
say
simply
had
to
leave
it
as
it
was
that
just
one
thing
about
her
but
i
could
tell
you
many
more
and
as
for
the
five
to
the
boatman
she
gave
him
the
money
herself
if
you
had
done
it
she
would
have
flung
her
arms
round
you
and
kissed
you
on
the
spot
you
should
have
been
the
lordly
cavalier
that
paid
an
extravagant
sum
for
a
shoe
that
would
have
suited
her
ideas
she
expected
it
and
as
you
did
she
did
it
herself
in
your
name
that
her
way
reckless
and
calculating
at
the
same
is
there
no
one
then
that
can
win
her
i
asked
severity
what
she
wants
said
the
doctor
evading
the
question
there
something
wrong
about
it
all
she
has
too
free
a
hand
she
can
do
as
she
pleases
and
have
her
own
way
all
the
time
people
take
notice
of
her
no
one
ever
disregards
her
there
is
always
something
at
hand
for
her
to
work
on
with
effect
have
you
noticed
the
way
i
treat
her
myself
like
a
schoolgirl
a
child
i
order
her
about
criticise
her
way
of
speaking
watch
her
carefully
and
show
her
up
now
and
again
do
you
think
she
does
understand
it
oh
she
stiff
and
proud
it
hurts
her
every
time
but
then
again
she
is
too
proud
to
show
it
but
the
way
she
should
be
handled
when
you
came
up
here
i
had
been
at
her
for
a
year
like
that
and
it
was
beginning
to
tell
she
cried
with
pain
and
vexation
she
was
growing
more
reasonable
then
you
came
along
and
upset
it
all
that
the
way
it
goes
one
lets
go
of
her
and
another
takes
her
up
again
after
you
there
be
a
third
i
suppose
you
never
oho
thought
i
to
myself
the
doctor
has
something
to
and
i
said
doctor
what
made
you
trouble
to
tell
me
all
that
long
story
what
was
it
for
am
i
to
help
you
with
her
upbringing
and
then
she
fiery
as
a
volcano
he
went
on
never
heeding
my
question
you
asked
if
no
one
could
ever
win
her
i
do
see
why
not
she
is
waiting
for
her
prince
and
he
has
come
yet
again
and
again
she
thinks
she
found
him
and
finds
out
she
wrong
she
thought
you
were
the
one
especially
because
you
had
eyes
like
an
animal
haha
i
say
though
herr
lieutenant
you
ought
at
least
to
have
brought
your
uniform
with
you
it
would
have
been
useful
now
why
should
she
be
won
i
have
seen
her
wringing
her
hands
with
longing
for
someone
to
come
and
take
her
carry
her
away
rule
over
her
body
and
soul
yes
but
he
must
come
from
somewhere
turn
up
suddenly
one
day
and
be
something
out
of
the
ordinary
i
have
an
idea
that
herr
mack
is
out
on
an
expedition
there
something
behind
this
journey
of
his
he
went
off
like
that
once
before
and
brought
a
man
back
with
brought
a
man
back
with
him
oh
but
he
was
no
good
said
the
doctor
with
a
wry
laugh
he
was
a
man
about
my
own
age
and
lame
too
like
myself
he
would
do
for
the
and
he
went
away
again
where
did
he
go
i
asked
looking
fixedly
at
him
where
went
away
oh
i
do
know
he
answered
confusedly
well
well
we
been
talking
too
long
about
this
already
that
foot
of
yours
oh
you
can
begin
to
walk
in
a
week
time
xix
a
woman
voice
outside
the
hut
the
blood
rushed
to
my
head
it
was
edwarda
glahn
glahn
is
ill
so
i
have
and
my
washerwoman
answered
outside
the
door
he
nearly
well
again
that
glahn
glahn
went
through
me
to
the
marrow
of
my
bones
she
said
my
name
twice
and
it
touched
me
her
voice
was
clear
and
ringing
she
opened
my
door
without
knocking
stepped
hastily
in
and
looked
at
me
and
suddenly
all
seemed
as
in
the
old
days
there
she
was
in
her
dyed
jacket
and
her
apron
tied
low
in
front
to
give
a
longer
waist
i
saw
it
all
at
once
and
her
look
her
brown
face
with
the
eyebrows
into
the
forehead
the
strangely
tender
expression
of
her
hands
all
came
on
me
so
strongly
that
my
brain
was
in
a
whirl
i
have
kissed
i
thought
to
myself
i
got
up
and
remained
standing
and
you
get
up
you
stand
when
i
come
she
said
oh
but
sit
down
your
foot
is
bad
you
shot
yourself
heavens
how
did
it
happen
i
did
not
know
of
it
till
just
now
and
i
was
thinking
all
the
time
what
can
have
happened
to
glahn
he
never
comes
now
i
knew
nothing
of
it
all
and
you
had
shot
yourself
and
it
was
weeks
ago
they
tell
me
and
i
knew
never
a
word
how
are
you
now
you
are
very
pale
i
should
hardly
recognize
you
and
your
foot
will
you
be
lame
now
the
doctor
says
you
will
not
be
lame
oh
i
am
so
fond
of
you
because
you
are
not
going
to
be
lame
i
thank
god
for
that
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
for
coming
up
like
this
without
letting
you
know
i
ran
nearly
all
the
way
she
bent
over
me
she
was
close
to
me
i
felt
her
breath
on
my
face
i
reached
out
my
hands
to
hold
her
then
she
moved
away
a
little
her
eyes
were
still
dewy
it
happened
this
way
i
stammered
out
i
was
putting
the
gun
away
in
the
corner
but
i
held
it
awkwardly
up
and
down
like
that
then
suddenly
i
heard
the
shot
it
was
an
an
accident
she
said
thoughtfully
nodding
her
head
let
me
see
it
is
the
left
foot
but
why
the
left
more
than
the
right
yes
of
course
an
accident
yes
an
accident
i
broke
in
how
should
i
know
why
it
just
happened
to
be
the
left
foot
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
how
i
was
holding
the
gun
it
could
be
the
right
foot
that
way
it
was
a
nuisance
of
she
looked
at
me
curiously
well
and
so
you
are
getting
on
nicely
she
said
looking
around
the
hut
why
did
you
send
the
woman
down
to
us
for
food
what
have
you
been
living
on
we
went
on
talking
for
a
few
minutes
i
asked
her
when
you
came
in
your
face
was
moved
and
your
eyes
sparkled
you
gave
me
your
hand
but
now
your
eyes
are
cold
again
am
i
wrong
pause
one
can
not
always
be
the
same
tell
me
this
one
thing
i
said
what
is
it
this
time
that
i
have
said
or
done
to
displease
you
then
perhaps
i
might
manage
better
in
she
looked
out
the
window
towards
the
far
horizon
stood
looking
out
thoughtfully
and
answered
me
as
i
sat
there
behind
her
nothing
glahn
just
thoughts
that
come
at
times
are
you
angry
now
remember
some
give
a
little
but
it
is
much
for
them
to
give
others
can
give
much
and
it
costs
them
nothing
and
which
has
given
more
you
have
grown
melancholy
in
your
illness
how
did
we
come
to
talk
of
all
this
and
suddenly
she
looked
at
me
her
face
flushed
with
joy
but
you
must
get
well
soon
now
we
shall
meet
and
she
held
out
her
hand
then
it
came
into
my
head
not
to
take
her
hand
i
stood
up
put
my
hands
behind
my
back
and
bowed
deeply
that
was
to
thank
her
for
her
kindness
in
coming
to
pay
me
a
visit
you
must
excuse
me
if
i
can
not
see
you
home
i
said
when
she
had
gone
i
sat
down
again
to
think
it
all
over
i
wrote
a
letter
and
asked
to
have
my
uniform
sent
xx
the
first
day
in
the
woods
i
was
happy
and
weary
all
the
creatures
came
up
close
and
looked
at
me
there
were
insects
on
the
trees
and
crawling
on
the
road
well
met
i
said
to
myself
the
feeling
of
the
woods
went
through
and
through
my
senses
i
cried
for
love
of
it
all
and
was
utterly
happy
i
was
dissolved
in
thanksgiving
dear
woods
my
home
god
peace
with
you
from
my
heart
i
stopped
and
turned
all
ways
named
the
things
with
tears
birds
and
trees
and
stones
and
grass
and
ants
i
called
them
all
by
name
looked
round
and
called
them
all
in
their
order
i
looked
up
to
the
hills
and
thought
now
now
i
am
coming
as
if
in
answer
to
their
calling
far
above
the
dwarf
falcon
was
hacking
away
i
knew
where
its
nests
were
but
the
sound
of
those
falcons
up
in
the
hills
sent
my
thoughts
far
away
about
noon
i
rowed
out
and
landed
on
a
little
island
an
islet
outside
the
harbour
there
were
flowers
with
long
stalks
reaching
to
my
knees
i
waded
in
strange
growths
raspberry
and
coarse
grass
there
were
no
animals
and
perhaps
there
had
never
been
any
human
being
there
the
sea
foamed
gently
against
the
rocks
and
wrapped
me
in
a
veil
of
murmuring
far
up
on
the
all
the
birds
of
the
coast
were
flying
and
screaming
but
the
sea
wrapped
me
round
on
all
sides
as
in
an
embrace
blessed
be
life
and
earth
and
sky
blessed
be
my
enemies
in
this
hour
i
will
be
gracious
to
my
bitterest
enemy
and
bind
the
latchet
of
his
shoe
ohoi
sounds
from
one
of
herr
mack
craft
my
heart
was
filled
with
sunshine
at
the
song
i
rowed
to
the
quay
walked
up
past
the
fishers
huts
and
home
the
day
was
at
an
end
i
had
my
meal
sharing
it
with
æsop
and
set
out
into
the
woods
once
more
soft
winds
breathed
silently
in
my
face
and
i
blessed
the
winds
because
they
touched
my
face
i
told
them
that
i
blessed
them
my
very
blood
sang
in
my
veins
for
thankfulness
æsop
laid
one
paw
on
my
knee
weariness
came
over
me
i
fell
asleep
lul
bells
ringing
some
leagues
out
at
sea
rose
a
mountain
i
said
two
prayers
one
for
my
dog
and
one
for
myself
and
we
entered
into
the
mountain
there
the
gate
closed
behind
us
i
started
at
its
clang
and
woke
flaming
red
sky
the
sun
there
stamping
before
my
eyes
the
night
the
horizon
echoing
with
light
æsop
and
i
moved
into
the
shade
all
quiet
around
us
no
we
will
not
sleep
now
i
said
to
the
dog
we
will
go
out
hunting
tomorrow
the
red
sun
is
shining
on
us
we
will
not
go
into
the
and
strange
thoughts
woke
to
life
in
me
and
the
blood
rose
to
my
head
excited
yet
still
weak
i
felt
someone
kissing
me
and
the
kiss
lay
on
my
lips
i
looked
round
there
was
nothing
visible
iselin
a
sound
in
the
grass
it
might
be
a
leaf
falling
to
the
ground
or
it
might
be
footsteps
a
shiver
through
the
woods
and
i
told
myself
it
might
be
iselin
breathing
here
in
these
woods
she
has
moved
iselin
here
she
has
listened
to
the
prayers
of
huntsmen
she
lived
out
on
my
farm
two
miles
away
four
generations
ago
she
sat
at
her
window
and
heard
the
echo
of
horns
in
the
forest
there
were
reindeer
and
wolf
and
bear
and
the
hunters
were
many
and
all
of
them
had
seen
her
grow
up
from
a
child
and
each
and
all
of
them
had
waited
for
her
one
had
seen
her
eyes
another
heard
her
voice
when
she
was
twelve
years
old
came
dundas
he
was
a
scotsman
and
traded
in
fish
and
had
many
ships
he
had
a
son
when
she
was
sixteen
she
saw
young
dundas
for
the
first
time
he
was
her
first
love
and
such
strange
fancies
flowed
through
me
and
my
head
grew
very
heavy
as
i
sat
there
i
closed
my
eyes
and
felt
for
iselin
kiss
iselin
are
you
here
lover
of
life
and
have
you
diderik
there
but
my
head
grew
heavier
still
and
i
floated
off
on
the
waves
of
sleep
lul
a
voice
speaking
as
if
the
seven
stars
themselves
were
singing
through
my
blood
iselin
voice
sleep
sleep
i
will
tell
you
of
my
love
while
you
sleep
i
was
sixteen
and
it
was
springtime
with
warm
winds
dundas
came
it
was
like
the
rushing
of
an
eagle
flight
i
met
him
one
morning
before
the
hunt
set
out
he
was
and
came
from
far
lands
he
walked
by
my
side
in
the
garden
and
when
he
touched
me
with
his
arm
i
began
to
love
him
two
red
spots
showed
in
his
forehead
and
i
could
have
kissed
those
two
red
spots
in
the
evening
after
the
hunt
i
went
to
seek
him
in
the
garden
and
i
was
afraid
lest
i
should
find
him
i
spoke
his
name
softly
to
myself
and
feared
lest
he
should
hear
then
he
came
out
from
the
bushes
and
whispered
hour
after
midnight
and
then
he
was
gone
hour
after
midnight
i
said
to
myself
did
he
mean
by
that
i
can
not
understand
he
must
have
meant
he
was
going
away
to
far
lands
again
an
hour
after
midnight
he
was
going
away
but
what
was
it
to
me
an
hour
after
midnight
he
came
i
sit
there
by
you
he
said
i
told
him
we
sat
there
on
the
sofa
i
moved
away
i
looked
down
are
cold
he
said
and
took
my
hand
a
little
after
he
said
cold
you
are
and
put
his
arm
round
me
and
i
was
warmed
with
his
arm
so
we
sat
a
little
while
then
a
cock
crew
you
hear
he
said
cock
crow
it
is
nearly
dawn
you
quite
sure
it
was
the
cock
crow
i
stammered
then
the
day
came
already
it
was
morning
something
was
thrilling
all
through
me
what
hour
was
it
that
struck
just
now
my
maid
came
in
flowers
have
not
been
watered
she
said
i
had
forgotten
my
flowers
a
carriage
drove
up
to
the
gate
cat
has
had
no
milk
said
the
maid
but
i
had
no
thought
for
my
flowers
or
my
cat
i
asked
that
dundas
outside
there
ask
him
to
come
in
here
to
me
at
once
i
am
expecting
him
there
was
something
he
knocked
i
opened
the
door
he
cried
and
kissed
my
lips
a
whole
minute
long
did
not
send
for
you
i
whispered
to
him
you
not
he
asked
then
i
answered
i
did
i
sent
for
you
i
was
longing
so
unspeakably
for
you
again
stay
here
with
me
a
little
and
i
covered
my
eyes
for
love
of
him
he
did
not
loose
me
i
sank
forward
and
hid
myself
close
to
him
that
was
something
crowing
again
he
said
listening
but
when
i
heard
what
he
said
i
cut
off
his
words
as
swiftly
as
i
could
and
answered
how
can
you
imagine
it
there
was
nothing
crowing
then
he
kissed
me
then
it
was
evening
again
and
dundas
was
gone
something
golden
thrilling
through
me
i
stood
before
the
glass
and
two
eyes
all
alight
with
love
looked
out
at
me
i
felt
something
moving
in
me
at
my
own
glance
and
always
that
something
thrilling
and
thrilling
round
my
heart
dear
god
i
had
never
seen
myself
with
those
eyes
before
and
i
kissed
my
own
lips
all
love
and
desire
in
the
glass
and
now
i
have
told
you
another
time
i
will
tell
you
of
svend
herlufsen
i
loved
him
too
he
lived
a
league
away
on
the
island
you
can
see
out
there
and
i
rowed
out
to
him
myself
on
calm
summer
evenings
because
i
loved
him
and
i
will
tell
you
of
stamer
he
was
a
priest
and
i
loved
him
i
love
all
through
my
i
heard
a
cock
crowing
down
at
sirilund
iselin

a
cock
is
crowing
for
us
too
i
cried
joyfully
and
reached
out
my
arms
i
woke
æsop
was
already
moving
gone
i
said
in
burning
sorrow
and
looked
round
there
was
no
one
no
one
there
it
was
morning
now
the
cock
was
still
crowing
down
at
sirilund
by
the
hut
stood
a
woman
eva
she
had
a
rope
in
her
hand
she
was
going
to
fetch
wood
there
was
the
morning
of
life
in
the
young
girl
figure
as
she
stood
there
all
golden
in
the
sun
you
must
not
think
she
stammered
out
what
is
it
i
must
not
think
eva
i
i
did
not
come
this
way
to
meet
you
i
was
just
passing
and
her
face
darkened
in
a
blush
xxi
my
foot
continued
to
trouble
me
a
good
deal
it
often
itched
at
nights
and
kept
me
awake
a
sudden
spasm
would
shoot
through
it
and
in
changeable
weather
it
was
full
of
gout
it
was
like
that
for
many
days
but
it
did
not
make
me
lame
after
all
the
days
went
on
herr
mack
had
returned
and
i
knew
it
soon
enough
he
took
my
boat
away
from
me
and
left
me
in
difficulties
for
it
was
still
the
closed
season
and
there
was
nothing
i
could
shoot
but
why
did
he
take
the
boat
away
from
me
like
that
two
of
herr
mack
folk
from
the
quay
had
rowed
out
with
a
stranger
in
the
morning
i
met
the
doctor
they
have
taken
my
boat
away
i
said
there
a
new
man
come
he
said
they
have
to
row
him
out
every
day
and
back
in
the
evening
he
investigating
the
the
newcomer
was
a
finn
herr
mack
had
met
him
accidentally
on
board
the
steamer
he
had
come
from
spitzbergen
with
some
collections
of
scales
and
small
they
called
him
baron
he
had
been
given
a
big
room
and
another
smaller
one
in
herr
mack
house
he
caused
quite
a
stir
in
the
place
i
am
in
difficulties
about
meat
i
might
ask
edwarda
for
something
for
this
evening
i
thought
i
walked
down
to
sirilund
i
noticed
at
once
that
edwarda
was
wearing
a
new
dress
she
seemed
to
have
grown
her
dress
was
much
longer
now
excuse
my
not
getting
up
she
said
quite
shortly
and
offered
her
hand

daughter

not
very
well
i
sorry
to
say
said
herr
mack
a
chill
she
has
not
been
taking
care
of
herself

came
to
ask
about
your
boat

suppose
i
shall
have
to
lend
you
another
one
instead
not
a
new
one
but
as
long
as
you
bail
it
out
every
now
and
then
we
a
scientist
come
to
stay
with
us
you
see
and
with
a
man
like
that
of
course
you
understand
he
has
no
time
to
spare
works
all
day
and
comes
home
in
the
evening

now
till
he
comes
you
will
be
interested
in
meeting
him
here
his
card
with
coronet
and
all
he
a
baron
a
very
nice
man
i
met
him
quite
by
aha
i
thought
so
they
do
ask
you
to
supper
well
thank
heaven
i
only
came
down
by
way
of
a
trial
i
can
go
home
again
i
still
some
fish
left
in
the
hut
enough
for
a
meal
i
daresay
the
baron
came
in
a
little
man
about
forty
with
a
long
narrow
face
prominent
cheek
bones
and
a
thinnish
black
beard
his
glance
was
sharp
and
penetrating
but
he
wore
strong
glasses
his
shirt
studs
too
were
ornamented
with
a
little
coronet
like
the
one
on
his
card
he
stooped
a
little
and
his
thin
hands
were
but
the
nails
were
like
yellow
metal
delighted
herr
lieutenant
have
you
been
here
long
may
i
ask
a
few
a
pleasant
man
herr
mack
asked
him
to
tell
us
about
his
scales
and
and
he
did
so
willingly
told
us
what
kind
of
clay
there
was
round
korholmerne
went
into
his
room
and
fetched
a
sample
of
weed
from
the
white
sea
he
was
constantly
lifting
up
his
right
forefinger
and
shifting
his
thick
gold
spectacles
back
and
forward
on
his
nose
herr
mack
was
most
interested
an
hour
passed
the
baron
spoke
of
my
accident
that
unfortunate
shot
was
i
well
again
now
pleased
to
hear
it
now
who
had
told
him
of
that
i
asked
and
how
did
you
hear
of
that
baron
oh
who
was
it
now
fröken
mack
i
think
was
it
not
you
fröken
mack
edwarda
flushed
hotly
i
had
come
so
poor
for
days
past
a
dark
misery
had
weighed
me
down
but
at
the
stranger
last
words
a
joy
fluttered
through
me
on
the
instant
i
did
not
look
at
edwarda
but
in
my
mind
i
thanked
her
thanks
for
having
spoken
of
me
named
my
name
with
your
tongue
though
it
be
all
valueless
to
you
i
took
my
leave
edwarda
still
kept
her
seat
excusing
herself
for
politeness
sake
by
saying
she
was
unwell
indifferently
she
gave
me
her
hand
and
herr
mack
stood
chatting
eagerly
with
the
baron
he
was
talking
of
his
grandfather
consul
mack
i
do
know
if
i
told
you
before
baron
this
diamond
here
was
a
gift
from
king
carl
johan
who
pinned
it
to
my
grandfather
breast
with
his
own
i
went
out
to
the
front
steps
no
one
saw
me
to
the
door
i
glanced
in
passing
through
the
windows
of
the
and
there
stood
edwarda
tall
upright
holding
the
curtains
apart
with
both
hands
looking
out
i
did
not
bow
to
her
i
forgot
everything
a
swirl
of
confusion
overwhelmed
me
and
drew
me
hurriedly
away
halt
stop
a
moment
i
said
to
myself
when
i
reached
the
woods
god
in
heaven
but
there
must
be
an
end
of
this
i
felt
all
hot
within
on
a
sudden
and
i
groaned
alas
i
had
no
longer
any
pride
in
my
heart
i
had
enjoyed
edwarda
favour
for
a
week
at
the
outside
but
that
was
over
long
since
and
i
had
not
ordered
my
ways
accordingly
from
now
on
my
heart
should
cry
to
her
dust
air
earth
on
my
way
god
in
heaven
yes
i
reached
the
hut
found
my
fish
and
had
a
meal
here
are
you
burning
out
your
life
for
the
sake
of
a
worthless
schoolgirl
and
your
nights
are
full
of
desolate
dreams
and
a
hot
wind
stands
still
about
your
head
a
close
foul
wind
of
last
year
breath
yet
the
sky
is
quivering
with
the
most
wonderful
blue
and
the
hills
are
calling
come
æsop
a
week
passed
i
hired
the
blacksmith
boat
and
fished
for
my
meals
edwarda
and
the
baron
were
always
together
in
the
evening
when
he
came
home
from
his
sea
trips
i
saw
them
once
at
the
mill
one
evening
they
both
came
by
my
hut
i
drew
away
from
the
window
and
barred
the
door
it
made
no
impression
on
me
whatever
to
see
them
together
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
another
evening
i
met
them
on
the
road
and
exchanged
greetings
i
left
it
to
the
baron
to
notice
me
first
and
merely
put
up
two
fingers
to
my
cap
to
be
discourteous
i
walked
slowly
past
them
and
looked
carelessly
at
them
as
i
did
so
another
day
passed
how
many
long
days
had
not
passed
already
i
was
downcast
dispirited
my
heart
pondered
idly
over
things
even
the
kindly
grey
stone
by
the
hut
seemed
to
wear
an
expression
of
sorrow
and
despair
when
i
went
by
there
was
rain
in
the
air
the
heat
seemed
gasping
before
me
wherever
i
went
and
i
felt
the
gout
in
my
left
foot
i
had
seen
one
of
herr
horses
shivering
in
its
harness
in
the
morning
all
these
things
were
significant
to
me
as
signs
of
the
weather
best
to
furnish
the
house
well
with
food
while
the
weather
holds
i
thought
i
tied
up
æsop
took
my
fishing
tackle
and
my
gun
and
went
down
to
the
quay
i
was
quite
unusually
troubled
in
mind
when
will
the
be
in
i
asked
a
fisherman
there
the
in
three
weeks
time
he
answered
i
am
expecting
my
uniform
i
said
then
i
met
one
of
herr
mack
assistants
from
the
store
i
shook
hands
with
him
and
said
tell
me
do
you
never
play
whist
now
at
sirilund
yes
often
he
answered
pause
i
have
not
been
there
lately
i
said
i
rowed
out
to
my
fishing
grounds
the
weather
was
mild
but
oppressive
the
gnats
gathered
in
swarms
and
i
had
to
smoke
all
the
time
to
keep
them
off
the
haddock
were
biting
i
fished
with
two
hooks
and
made
a
good
haul
on
the
way
back
i
shot
a
brace
of
guillemots
when
i
came
in
to
the
quay
the
blacksmith
was
there
at
work
a
thought
occurred
to
me
i
asked
him
going
up
my
way
no
said
he
herr
mack
given
me
a
bit
of
work
to
do
here
keep
me
till
i
nodded
and
thought
to
myself
that
it
was
well
i
took
my
fish
and
went
off
going
round
by
way
of
the
house
eva
was
there
alone
i
have
been
longing
for
you
with
all
my
heart
i
told
her
and
i
was
moved
at
the
sight
of
her
she
could
hardly
look
me
in
the
face
for
wonder
i
love
your
youth
and
your
good
eyes
i
said
punish
me
because
i
have
thought
more
of
another
than
of
you
i
tell
you
i
have
come
here
only
to
see
you
you
make
me
happy
i
am
fond
of
you
did
you
hear
me
calling
for
you
last
night
no
she
answered
frightened
i
called
edwarda
but
it
was
you
i
meant
i
woke
up
and
heard
myself
yes
it
was
you
i
meant
it
was
only
a
mistake
i
said
but
it
was
only
by
accident
by
heaven
you
are
my
dearest
eva
your
lips
are
so
red
your
feet
are
prettier
than
edwarda
just
look
yourself
and
joy
such
as
i
had
never
seen
in
her
lit
up
her
face
she
made
as
if
to
turn
away
but
hesitated
and
put
one
arm
round
my
neck
we
talked
together
sitting
all
the
time
on
a
long
bench
talking
to
each
other
of
many
things
i
said
would
you
believe
it
edwarda
has
not
learnt
to
speak
properly
yet
she
talks
like
a
child
and
says
happier
i
heard
her
myself
would
you
say
she
had
a
lovely
forehead
i
do
not
think
so
she
has
a
devilish
forehead
and
she
does
not
wash
her
but
we
were
going
to
talk
of
her
any
quite
right
i
a
little
pause
i
was
thinking
of
something
and
fell
silent
why
are
your
eyes
wet
asked
eva
she
has
a
lovely
forehead
though
i
said
and
her
hands
are
always
clean
it
was
only
an
accident
that
they
were
dirty
once
i
did
not
mean
to
say
what
i
but
then
i
went
on
angrily
with
clenched
teeth
i
sit
thinking
of
you
all
the
time
eva
but
it
occurs
to
me
that
perhaps
you
have
not
heard
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
now
the
first
time
edwarda
saw
æsop
she
said
that
was
the
name
of
a
wise
man
a
phrygian
he
was
now
was
that
simply
silly
she
had
read
it
in
a
book
the
same
day
i
sure
of
yes
says
eva
but
what
of
it
and
as
far
as
i
remember
she
said
too
that
æsop
had
xanthus
for
his
teacher
hahaha
yes
well
what
the
devil
is
the
sense
of
telling
a
crowd
of
people
that
æsop
had
xanthus
for
his
teacher
i
ask
you
oh
you
are
not
in
the
mood
eva
or
you
would
laugh
till
your
sides
ached
at
yes
i
think
it
is
funny
said
eva
and
began
laughing
forcedly
and
in
wonder
but
i
do
understand
it
as
well
as
you
i
sit
silent
and
thoughtful
silent
and
thoughtful
do
you
like
best
to
sit
still
and
not
talk
asked
eva
softly
goodness
shone
in
her
eyes
she
passed
her
hand
over
my
hair
you
good
good
soul
i
broke
out
and
pressed
her
close
to
me
i
know
for
certain
i
am
perishing
for
love
of
you
i
love
you
more
and
more
the
end
of
it
will
be
that
you
must
go
with
me
when
i
go
away
you
shall
see
could
you
go
with
me
yes
she
answered
i
hardly
heard
that
yes
but
i
felt
it
in
her
breath
and
all
through
her
we
held
each
other
fiercely
an
hour
later
i
kissed
eva
and
went
away
at
the
door
i
meet
herr
mack
herr
mack
himself
he
started
stared
into
the
house
stopped
there
on
the
doorstep
staring
in
ho
said
he
and
could
say
no
more
he
seemed
thrown
altogether
off
his
balance
you
did
not
expect
to
find
me
here
i
said
raising
my
cap
eva
did
not
move
herr
mack
regained
his
composure
a
curious
confidence
appeared
in
his
manner
and
he
answered
you
are
mistaken
i
came
on
purpose
to
find
you
i
wish
to
point
out
to
you
that
from
the
of
april
it
is
forbidden
to
fire
a
shot
within
half
a
mile
of
the
you
shot
two
birds
out
at
the
island
you
were
seen
doing
i
shot
two
guillemots
i
said
helplessly
i
saw
at
once
that
the
man
was
in
the
right
two
guillemots
or
two
eiderducks
it
is
all
the
same
you
were
within
the
prohibited
i
admit
it
i
said
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
but
it
ought
to
have
occurred
to
i
also
fired
off
both
barrels
once
in
may
at
very
nearly
the
same
spot
it
was
on
a
picnic
one
day
and
it
was
done
at
your
own
that
is
another
matter
answered
herr
mack
shortly
well
then
devil
take
it
you
know
what
you
have
to
do
i
suppose
perfectly
well
he
answered
eva
held
herself
in
readiness
when
i
went
out
she
followed
me
she
had
put
on
a
kerchief
and
walked
away
from
the
house
i
saw
her
going
down
towards
the
quay
herr
mack
walked
back
home
i
thought
it
over
what
a
mind
to
hit
on
that
all
at
once
and
save
himself
and
those
piercing
eyes
of
his
a
shot
two
shots
a
brace
of
guillemots
a
fine
a
payment
and
then
everything
would
be
settled
with
herr
mack
and
his
house
after
all
it
was
going
off
so
beautifully
quickly
and
neatly
the
rain
was
coming
down
already
in
great
soft
drops
the
magpies
flew
low
along
the
ground
and
when
i
came
home
and
turned
æsop
loose
he
began
eating
the
grass
the
wind
was
beginning
to
rustle
xxii
a
league
below
me
is
the
sea
it
is
raining
and
i
am
up
in
the
hills
an
overhanging
rock
shelters
me
from
the
rain
i
smoke
my
pipe
smoke
one
pipe
after
another
and
every
time
i
light
it
the
tobacco
curls
up
like
little
worms
crawling
from
the
ash
so
also
with
the
thoughts
that
twirl
in
my
head
before
me
on
the
ground
lies
a
bundle
of
dry
twigs
from
the
ruin
of
a
bird
nest
and
as
with
that
nest
so
also
with
my
soul
i
remember
every
trifle
of
that
day
and
the
next
hoho
i
was
hard
put
to
it
then
i
sit
here
up
in
the
hills
and
the
sea
and
the
air
are
voiceful
a
seething
and
moaning
of
the
wind
and
weather
cruel
to
listen
to
fishing
boats
and
small
craft
show
far
out
with
reefed
sails
human
beings
on
board
making
for
somewhere
no
doubt
and
heaven
knows
where
all
those
lives
are
making
for
think
i
the
sea
flings
itself
up
in
foam
and
rolls
and
rolls
as
if
inhabited
by
great
fierce
figures
that
fling
their
limbs
about
and
roar
at
one
another
nay
a
festival
of
ten
thousand
piping
devils
that
duck
their
heads
down
between
their
shoulders
and
circle
about
lashing
the
sea
white
with
the
tips
of
their
wings
far
far
out
lies
a
hidden
reef
and
from
that
hidden
reef
rises
a
white
merman
shaking
his
head
after
a
leaky
sailboat
making
out
to
sea
before
the
wind
hoho
out
to
sea
out
to
the
desolate
sea
i
am
glad
to
be
alone
that
none
may
see
my
eyes
i
lean
securely
against
the
wall
of
rock
knowing
that
no
one
can
observe
me
from
behind
a
bird
swoops
over
the
crest
with
a
broken
cry
at
the
same
moment
a
boulder
close
by
breaks
loose
and
rolls
down
towards
the
sea
and
i
sit
there
still
for
a
while
i
sink
into
restfulness
a
warm
sense
of
comfort
quivers
in
me
because
i
can
sit
so
pleasantly
under
shelter
while
the
rain
pours
down
outside
i
button
up
my
jacket
thanking
god
for
the
warmth
of
it
a
little
while
more
and
i
fall
asleep
it
was
afternoon
i
went
home
it
was
still
raining
then
an
unexpected
encounter
edwarda
stood
there
before
me
on
the
path
she
was
wet
through
as
if
she
had
been
out
in
the
rain
a
long
time
but
she
smiled
ho
i
thought
to
myself
and
my
anger
rose
i
gripped
my
gun
and
walked
fiercely
although
she
herself
was
smiling
she
called
speaking
first
i
waited
till
i
had
come
some
paces
nearer
and
said
fair
one
i
give
you
she
started
in
surprise
at
my
jesting
tone
alas
i
knew
not
what
i
was
saying
she
smiled
timidly
and
looked
at
me
have
you
been
up
in
the
hills
she
asked
then
you
must
be
wet
i
have
a
kerchief
here
if
you
care
for
it
i
can
spare
it
oh
you
do
know
and
she
cast
down
her
eyes
and
shook
her
head
when
i
did
not
take
her
kerchief
a
kerchief
i
answer
grinning
in
anger
and
surprise
but
i
have
a
jacket
here
wo
you
borrow
it
i
can
spare
it
i
would
have
lent
it
to
anyone
you
need
not
be
afraid
to
take
it
i
would
have
lent
it
to
a
fishwife
and
i
could
see
that
she
was
eager
to
hear
what
i
would
say
she
listened
with
such
attention
that
it
made
her
look
ugly
she
forgot
to
hold
her
lips
together
there
she
stood
with
the
kerchief
in
her
hand
a
white
silk
kerchief
which
she
had
taken
from
her
neck
i
tore
off
my
jacket
in
turn
for
heaven
sake
put
it
on
again
she
cried
do
do
that
are
you
so
angry
with
me
put
your
jacket
on
do
before
you
get
wet
i
put
on
my
jacket
again
where
are
you
going
i
asked
sullenly
no
nowhere

ca
understand
what
made
you
take
off
your
jacket
like
that
what
have
you
done
with
the
baron

went
on
the
count
be
out
at
sea
on
a
day
like
glahn
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
something
i
interrupted
her
may
i
beg
you
to
convey
my
respects
to
the
duke
we
looked
at
each
other
i
was
ready
to
break
in
with
further
interruptions
as
soon
as
she
opened
her
mouth
at
last
a
twinge
of
pain
passed
over
her
face
i
turned
away
and
said
seriously
you
should
send
his
highness
packing
edwarda
he
is
not
the
man
for
you
i
assure
you
he
has
been
wondering
these
last
few
days
whether
to
make
you
his
wife
or
not
and
that
is
not
good
enough
for
no
do
let
us
talk
about
that
please
glahn
i
have
been
thinking
of
you
you
could
take
off
your
jacket
and
get
wet
through
for
sake
i
come
to
you
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
went
on
i
should
advise
you
to
take
the
doctor
instead
what
have
you
against
him
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
and
a
clever
head
you
should
think
it
oh
but
do
listen
a
minute
æsop
my
dog
was
waiting
for
me
in
the
hut
i
took
off
my
cap
bowed
to
her
again
and
said
fair
one
i
give
you
and
i
started
off
she
gave
a
cry
oh
you
are
tearing
my
heart
out
i
came
to
you
i
waited
for
you
here
and
i
smiled
when
you
came
i
was
nearly
out
of
my
mind
yesterday
because
of
something
i
had
been
thinking
of
all
the
time
my
head
was
in
a
whirl
and
i
thought
of
you
all
the
time
i
was
sitting
at
home
and
someone
came
in
i
did
not
look
up
but
i
knew
who
it
was
rowed
half
a
mile
he
said
you
tired
i
asked
yes
very
tired
and
it
blistered
my
hands
he
said
and
was
very
concerned
about
it
and
i
thought
fancy
being
concerned
about
that
a
little
after
he
said
heard
someone
whispering
outside
my
window
last
night
it
was
your
maid
and
one
of
the
store
men
talking
very
intimately
indeed
they
are
to
be
married
i
said
this
was
at
two
in
the
morning
what
of
it
said
i
and
after
a
little
night
is
their
own
then
he
shifted
his
gold
spectacles
a
little
up
his
nose
and
observed
do
you
think
at
that
hour
of
night
it
does
look
well
still
i
did
look
up
and
we
sat
like
that
for
ten
minutes
i
bring
you
a
shawl
to
put
over
your
shoulders
he
asked
thank
you
i
answered
only
i
dared
take
your
little
hand
he
said
i
did
not
answer
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
he
laid
a
little
box
in
my
lap
i
opened
the
box
and
found
a
brooch
in
it
there
was
a
coronet
on
the
brooch
and
i
counted
ten
stones
in
it
glahn
i
have
that
brooch
with
me
now
will
you
look
at
it
it
is
trampled
to
bits
come
come
and
see
how
it
is
trampled
to
bits
and
what
am
i
to
do
with
this
brooch
i
asked
it
he
answered
but
i
gave
him
back
the
brooch
and
said
me
alone
it
is
another
i
care
for
other
he
asked
hunter
in
the
woods
i
said
gave
me
two
lovely
feathers
once
for
a
keepsake
take
back
your
brooch
but
he
would
not
then
i
looked
at
him
for
the
first
time
his
eyes
were
piercing
will
not
take
back
the
brooch
you
may
do
with
it
as
you
please
tread
on
it
he
said
i
stood
up
and
put
the
brooch
under
my
heel
and
trod
on
it
that
was
this
morning
for
four
hours
i
waited
and
waited
after
dinner
i
went
out
he
came
to
meet
me
on
the
road
are
you
going
he
asked
glahn
i
answered
ask
him
not
to
forget
me
since
one
i
have
been
waiting
here
i
stood
by
a
tree
and
saw
you
coming
you
were
like
a
god
i
loved
your
figure
your
beard
and
your
shoulders
loved
everything
about
you
now
you
are
impatient
you
want
to
go
only
to
go
i
am
nothing
to
you
you
will
not
look
at
me
i
had
stopped
when
she
had
finished
speaking
i
began
walking
on
again
i
was
worn
out
with
despair
and
i
smiled
my
heart
was
hard
yes
i
said
and
stopped
again
you
had
something
to
say
to
me
but
at
this
scorn
of
mine
she
wearied
of
me
something
to
say
to
you
but
i
have
told
you
did
you
not
hear
no
nothing
i
have
nothing
to
tell
you
any
more
her
voice
trembled
strangely
but
that
did
not
move
me
next
morning
edwarda
was
standing
outside
the
hut
when
i
went
out
i
had
thought
it
all
over
during
the
night
and
taken
my
resolve
why
should
i
let
myself
be
dazzled
any
longer
by
this
creature
of
moods
a
a
thing
of
no
culture
had
not
her
name
fastened
for
long
enough
on
my
heart
sucking
it
dry
enough
of
that
though
it
struck
me
that
perhaps
i
had
come
nearer
to
her
by
treating
her
with
indifference
and
scorn
oh
how
grandly
i
had
scorned
her
after
she
had
made
a
long
speech
of
several
minutes
to
say
calmly
yes
you
had
something
to
say
to
me
she
was
standing
by
the
big
stone
she
was
in
great
excitement
and
would
have
run
towards
me
her
arms
were
already
opened
but
she
stopped
and
stood
there
wringing
her
hands
i
took
off
my
cap
and
bowed
to
her
without
a
word
just
one
thing
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
glahn
she
said
entreatingly
and
i
did
not
move
but
waited
just
to
hear
what
she
would
say
next
i
hear
you
have
been
down
at
the
blacksmith
one
evening
it
was
eva
was
alone
in
the
i
started
at
that
and
answered
who
told
you
that
i
do
go
about
spying
she
cried
i
heard
it
last
evening
my
father
told
me
when
i
got
home
all
wet
through
last
night
my
father
said
were
rude
to
the
baron
i
answered
have
you
been
now
he
asked
again
i
answered
glahn
and
then
my
father
told
i
struggled
with
my
despair
i
said
what
is
more
eva
has
been
has
she
been
here
in
the
hut
more
than
once
i
made
her
go
in
we
talked
here
too
pause
be
firm
i
said
to
myself
and
then
aloud
since
you
are
so
kind
as
to
mix
yourself
up
in
my
affairs
i
will
not
be
behindhand
i
suggested
yesterday
that
you
should
take
the
doctor
have
you
thought
it
over
for
really
you
know
the
prince
is
simply
her
eyes
lit
with
anger
he
is
not
i
tell
you
she
cried
passionately
no
he
is
better
than
you
he
can
move
about
in
a
house
without
breaking
cups
and
glasses
he
leaves
my
shoes
alone
yes
he
knows
how
to
move
in
society
but
you
are
ridiculous
i
am
ashamed
of
you
you
are
unendurable
do
you
understand
that
her
words
struck
deep
i
bowed
my
head
and
said
you
are
right
i
am
not
good
at
moving
in
society
be
merciful
you
do
not
understand
me
i
live
in
the
woods
by
choice
that
is
my
happiness
here
where
i
am
all
alone
it
can
hurt
no
one
that
i
am
as
i
am
but
when
i
go
among
others
i
have
to
use
all
my
will
power
to
be
as
i
should
for
two
years
now
i
have
been
so
little
among
people
at
all
there
no
saying
what
mad
thing
you
will
do
next
she
went
on
and
it
is
intolerable
to
be
constantly
looking
after
how
mercilessly
she
said
it
a
very
bitter
pain
passed
through
me
i
almost
toppled
before
her
violence
edwarda
had
not
yet
done
she
went
on
you
might
get
eva
to
look
after
you
perhaps
it
a
pity
though
that
she
eva
eva
married
did
you
say
yes
married
why
who
is
her
husband
surely
you
know
that
she
is
the
blacksmith
i
thought
she
was
his
no
she
is
his
wife
do
you
think
i
am
lying
to
you
i
had
not
thought
about
it
at
all
i
was
simply
astonished
i
just
stood
there
thinking
is
eva
married
so
you
have
made
a
happy
choice
says
edwarda
well
there
seemed
no
end
to
the
business
i
was
trembling
with
indignation
and
i
said
but
you
had
better
take
the
doctor
as
i
said
take
a
friend
advice
that
prince
of
yours
is
an
old
and
in
my
excitement
i
lied
about
him
exaggerated
his
age
declared
he
was
bald
that
he
was
almost
totally
blind
i
asserted
moreover
that
he
wore
that
coronet
thing
in
his
shirt
front
wholly
and
solely
to
show
off
his
nobility
as
for
me
i
have
not
cared
to
make
his
acquaintance
there
is
nothing
in
him
of
mark
at
all
he
lacks
the
first
principles
he
is
but
he
is
something
he
is
something
she
cried
and
her
voice
broke
with
anger
he
is
far
more
than
you
think
you
thing
of
the
woods
you
wait
oh
he
shall
talk
to
you
i
will
ask
him
myself
you
do
believe
i
love
him
but
you
shall
see
you
are
mistaken
i
will
marry
him
i
will
think
of
him
night
and
day
mark
what
i
say
i
love
him
let
eva
come
if
she
likes
hahaha
heavens
let
her
come
it
is
less
than
nothing
to
me
and
now
let
me
get
away
from
here
she
began
walking
down
the
path
from
the
hut
she
took
a
few
small
hurried
steps
turned
round
her
face
still
pale
as
death
and
moaned
and
let
me
never
see
your
face
xxiii
leaves
were
yellowing
the
had
grown
to
full
height
and
stood
in
flower
the
shooting
season
came
round
again
i
shot
hare
and
ptarmigan
and
grouse
one
day
i
shot
an
eagle
calm
open
sky
cool
nights
many
clear

tones
and
dear
sounds
in
the
woods

resting
vast
and
peaceful
i
have
not
heard
anything
from
herr
mack
about
the
two
guillemots
i
shot
i
said
to
the
doctor

can
thank
edwarda
for
that
he
said

heard
that
she
set
herself
against
i
do
not
thank
her
for
it
said
i
indian
summer
indian
summer
the
stars
lay
like
belts
in
through
the
yellowing
woods
a
new
star
came
every
day
the
moon
showed
like
a
shadow
a
shadow
of
gold
dipped
in
silver
heaven
help

my
hand
silently

since
this
last

a
load
how
much
wood

that
child
carried
home
from
the
forest
this
summer
alone

the
load
down

and
let
me
see

eyes

singing
and
a
warmth
goes
through
me
you
are
singing
this
evening
child
yes
i
am
and
being
smaller
than
i
she
jumps
up
a
little
to
put
her
arms
round
my
neck
but
eva
you
have
scratched
your
hands
oh
if
you
had
not
scratched
them
so
it
does
her
face
beams
wonderfully
eva
have
you
spoken
to
herr
mack
yes
what
did
he
say
and
what
did
you
he
is
so
hard
with
us
now
he
makes
my
husband
work
day
and
night
down
at
the
quay
and
keeps
me
at
all
sorts
of
jobs
as
well
he
has
ordered
me
to
do
man
work
why
does
he
do
that
eva
looks
down
why
does
he
do
that
eva
because
i
love
but
how
could
he
know
i
told
pause
would
to
heaven
he
were
not
so
harsh
with
you
but
it
does
matter
it
does
matter
at
all
and
her
voice
is
like
a
little
tremulous
song
in
the
woods
the
woods
more
yellow
still
it
is
drawing
towards
autumn
now
a
few
more
stars
have
come
in
the
sky
and
from
now
on
the
moon
looks
like
a
shadow
of
silver
dipped
in
gold
there
is
no
cold
nothing
only
a
cool
stillness
and
a
flow
of
life
in
the
woods
every
tree
stands
in
silent
thought
the
berries
are
ripe
then
the
of
august
and
the
three
iron
nights
footnote
used
of
the
nights
in
august
when
the
first
frosts
appear
xxiv
the
first
iron
night
at
nine
the
sun
sets
a
dull
darkness
settles
over
the
earth
a
star
or
so
can
be
seen
two
hours
later
there
is
a
glow
of
the
moon
i
wander
up
in
the
woods
with
my
gun
and
my
dog
i
light
a
fire
and
the
light
of
the
flames
shines
in
between
the
there
is
no
frost
the
first
iron
night
i
say
and
a
confused
passionate
delight
in
the
time
and
the
place
sends
a
strange
shiver
through
me
hail
men
and
beasts
and
birds
to
the
lonely
night
in
the
woods
in
the
woods
hail
to
the
darkness
and
god
murmuring
between
the
trees
to
the
sweet
simple
melody
of
silence
in
my
ears
to
green
leaves
and
yellow
hail
to
the
i
hear
a
snout
against
the
grass
a
dog
sniffing
over
the
ground
a
wild
hail
to
the
wildcat
lying
crouched
sighting
and
ready
to
spring
on
a
sparrow
in
the
dark
in
the
dark
hail
to
the
merciful
silence
upon
earth
to
the
stars
and
the
half
moon
ay
to
them
and
to
it
i
rise
and
listen
no
one
has
heard
me
i
sit
down
again
thanks
for
the
lonely
night
for
the
hills
the
rush
of
the
darkness
and
the
sea
through
my
heart
thanks
for
my
life
for
my
breath
for
the
boon
of
being
alive
thanks
from
my
heart
for
these
hear
east
and
west
oh
hear
it
is
the
eternal
god
this
silence
murmuring
in
my
ears
is
the
blood
of
all
nature
seething
it
is
god
weaving
through
the
world
and
me
i
see
a
glistening
gossamer
thread
in
the
light
of
my
fire
i
hear
a
boat
rowing
across
the
harbour
the
northern
lights
flare
over
the
heavens
to
the
north
by
my
immortal
soul
i
am
full
of
thanks
that
it
is
i
who
am
sitting
here
silence
a
fir
cone
falls
dully
to
the
ground
a
fir
cone
fell
i
think
to
myself
the
moon
is
high
the
fire
flickers
over
the
brands
and
is
dying
and
in
the
late
night
i
wander
home
the
second
iron
night
the
same
stillness
and
mild
weather
my
soul
is
pondering
i
walk
mechanically
over
to
a
tree
pull
my
cap
deep
down
over
my
eyes
and
lean
against
that
tree
with
hands
clasped
behind
my
neck
i
gazed
and
think
the
flame
from
my
fire
dazzles
my
eyes
and
i
do
not
feel
it
i
stand
in
that
stupor
for
a
while
looking
at
the
fire
my
legs
fail
me
first
and
grow
tired
thoroughly
stiff
i
sit
down
not
till
then
do
i
think
of
what
i
have
been
doing
why
should
i
stare
so
long
at
the
fire
æsop
lifts
his
head
and
listens
he
hears
footsteps
eva
appears
among
the
trees
i
am
very
thoughtful
and
sad
this
evening
i
say
and
in
sympathy
she
makes
no
answer
i
love
three
things
i
go
on
i
love
a
dream
of
love
i
once
had
i
love
you
and
i
love
this
spot
of
and
which
do
you
love
most
the
all
still
again
æsop
knows
eva
he
lays
his
head
on
one
side
and
looks
at
her
i
murmur
i
saw
a
girl
on
the
road
she
walked
arm
in
arm
with
her
lover
the
girl
looked
towards
me
and
could
scarcely
keep
from
laughing
as
i
what
was
she
laughing
at
i
do
know
at
me
i
suppose
why
do
you
ask
did
you
know
her
yes
i
and
did
she
know
you
no
she
acted
as
if
she
did
know
me
but
why
do
you
sit
there
worming
things
out
of
me
it
is
not
a
nice
thing
to
do
you
will
not
get
me
to
tell
you
her
pause
i
murmur
again
what
was
she
laughing
at
she
is
a
flirt
but
what
was
she
laughing
at
what
had
i
done
to
harm
her
eva
answers
it
was
cruel
of
her
to
laugh
at
no
it
was
not
cruel
of
her
i
cry
how
dare
you
sit
there
speaking
ill
of
her
she
never
did
an
unkind
thing
it
was
only
right
that
she
should
laugh
at
me
be
quiet
devil
take
you
and
leave
me
in
peace
do
you
hear
and
eva
terrified
leaves
me
in
peace
i
look
at
her
and
repent
my
harsh
words
at
once
i
fall
down
before
her
wringing
my
hands
go
home
eva
it
is
you
i
love
most
how
could
i
love
a
dream
it
was
only
a
jest
it
is
you
i
love
but
go
home
now
i
will
come
to
you
remember
i
am
yours
yes
do
not
forget
it
and
eva
goes
home
the
third
iron
night
a
night
of
extremes
tension
if
only
there
were
a
little
frost
instead
still
heat
after
the
sun
of
the
day
the
night
is
like
a
lukewarm
marsh
i
light
my
fire
eva
it
can
be
a
delight
at
times
to
be
dragged
by
the
hair
so
strangely
can
the
mind
of
a
man
be
warped
he
can
be
dragged
by
the
hair
over
hill
and
dale
and
if
asked
what
is
happening
can
answer
in
ecstasy
am
being
dragged
by
the
hair
and
if
anyone
asks
shall
i
not
help
you
release
you
he
answers
and
if
they
ask
how
can
you
endure
it
he
answers
can
endure
it
for
i
love
the
hand
that
drags
me
eva
do
you
know
what
it
is
to
hope
yes
i
think
look
you
eva
hope
is
a
strange
thing
a
very
strange
thing
you
can
go
out
one
morning
along
the
road
hoping
to
meet
one
whom
you
are
fond
of
and
do
you
no
why
not
because
that
one
is
busy
that
morning
is
somewhere
else
perhaps
once
i
got
to
know
an
old
blind
lapp
up
in
the
hills
for
years
he
had
seen
nothing
and
now
he
was
over
seventy
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
sight
was
getting
better
little
by
little
getting
on
gradually
he
thought
if
all
went
well
he
would
be
able
to
make
out
the
sun
in
a
few
years
time
his
hair
was
still
black
but
his
eyes
were
quite
white
when
we
sat
in
his
hut
smoking
he
would
tell
of
all
the
things
he
had
seen
before
he
went
blind
he
was
hardy
and
strong
without
feeling
indestructible
and
he
kept
his
hope
when
i
was
going
he
came
out
with
me
and
began
pointing
in
different
ways
the
south
he
said
there
north
now
you
go
that
way
first
and
when
you
get
a
little
way
down
turn
off
that
way
right
i
said
and
at
that
the
lapp
laughed
contentedly
and
said
i
did
not
know
that
forty
or
fifty
years
back
so
i
must
see
better
now
than
i
used
to
yes
it
is
improving
all
the
time
and
then
he
crouched
down
and
crept
into
his
hut
again
the
same
old
hut
his
home
on
earth
and
he
sat
down
by
the
fire
as
before
full
of
hope
that
in
some
few
years
he
would
be
able
to
make
out
the
sun
eva
is
strange
about
hope
here
am
i
for
instance
hoping
all
the
time
that
i
may
forget
the
one
i
did
not
meet
on
the
road
this
morning
you
talk
so
it
is
the
third
of
the
iron
nights
i
promise
you
eva
to
be
a
different
man
let
me
be
alone
now
you
will
not
know
me
again
i
shall
laugh
and
kiss
you
my
own
sweet
girl
just
think
only
this
one
night
more
a
few
hours
and
then
i
shall
be
a
different
man
i
lie
down
closer
to
the
fire
and
look
at
the
flames
a
pine
cone
falls
from
the
branch
a
dry
twig
or
so
falls
too
the
night
is
like
a
boundless
depth
i
close
my
eyes
after
an
hour
my
senses
begin
swinging
in
a
certain
rhythm
i
am
ringing
in
tune
with
the
great
stillness
ringing
with
it
i
look
at
the
it
stands
in
the
sky
like
a
white
scale
and
i
have
a
feeling
of
love
for
it
i
can
feel
myself
blushing
it
is
the
moon
i
say
softly
and
passionately
it
is
the
moon
and
my
heart
strikes
toward
it
in
a
soft
throbbing
so
for
some
minutes
it
is
blowing
a
little
a
stranger
wind
comes
to
me
a
mysterious
current
of
air
what
is
it
i
look
round
but
see
no
one
the
wind
calls
me
and
my
soul
bows
acknowledging
the
call
and
i
feel
myself
lifted
into
the
air
pressed
to
an
invisible
breast
my
eyes
are
dewed
i
tremble
god
is
standing
near
watching
me
again
several
minutes
pass
i
turn
my
head
round
the
stranger
wind
is
gone
and
i
see
something
like
the
back
of
a
spirit
wandering
silently
in
through
the
woods
i
struggle
a
short
while
with
a
heavy
melancholy
i
was
worn
out
with
emotions
i
am
deathly
tired
and
i
sleep
when
i
awoke
the
night
was
past
alas
i
had
been
going
about
for
a
long
time
in
a
sad
state
full
of
fever
on
the
verge
of
falling
down
stricken
with
some
sickness
or
other
often
things
had
seemed
upside
down
i
had
been
looking
at
everything
through
inflamed
eyes
a
deep
misery
had
possessed
me
it
was
over
now
xxv
it
was
autumn
the
summer
was
gone
it
passed
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
ah
how
quickly
it
was
gone
the
days
were
cold
now
i
went
out
shooting
and
fishing
sang
songs
in
the
woods
and
there
were
days
with
a
thick
mist
that
came
floating
in
from
the
sea
damming
up
everything
behind
a
wall
of
murk
one
such
day
something
happened
i
lost
my
way
blundered
through
into
the
woods
of
the
annexe
and
came
to
the
doctor
house
there
were
visitors
there
the
young
ladies
i
had
met
before
young
people
dancing
just
like
madcap
foals
a
carriage
came
rolling
up
and
stopped
outside
the
gate
edwarda
was
in
it
she
started
at
sight
of
me
i
said
quietly
but
the
doctor
held
me
back
edwarda
was
troubled
by
my
presence
at
first
and
looked
down
when
i
spoke
afterwards
she
bore
with
me
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
ask
me
a
question
about
something
or
other
she
was
strikingly
pale
the
mist
lay
grey
and
cold
upon
her
face
she
did
not
get
out
of
the
carriage
i
have
come
on
an
errand
she
said
i
come
from
the
parish
church
and
none
of
you
were
there
they
said
you
were
here
i
have
been
driving
for
hours
to
find
you
we
are
having
a
little
party
the
baron
is
going
away
next
week
and
i
have
been
told
to
invite
you
all
there
will
be
dancing
too
they
all
bowed
and
thanked
her
to
me
she
went
on
now
do
stay
away
will
you
do
send
a
note
at
the
last
minute
making
some
she
did
not
say
that
to
any
of
the
others
a
little
after
she
drove
away
i
was
so
moved
by
this
unexpected
meeting
that
for
a
little
while
i
was
secretly
mad
with
joy
then
i
took
leave
of
the
doctor
and
his
guests
and
set
off
for
home
how
gracious
she
was
to
me
how
gracious
she
was
to
me
what
could
i
do
for
her
in
return
my
hands
felt
helpless
a
sweet
cold
went
through
my
wrists
i
thought
to
myself
here
am
i
with
my
limbs
hanging
helpless
for
joy
i
can
not
even
clench
my
hands
i
can
only
find
tears
in
my
eyes
for
my
own
helplessness
what
is
to
be
done
about
it
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
i
reached
home
i
went
round
by
the
quay
and
asked
a
fisherman
if
the
would
not
be
in
by
evening
alas
no
the
would
not
be
in
till
some
time
next
week
i
hurried
up
to
the
hut
and
began
looking
over
my
best
suit
i
cleaned
it
up
and
made
it
look
decent
there
were
holes
in
it
here
and
there
and
i
wept
and
darned
them
when
i
had
finished
i
lay
down
on
the
bed
this
rest
lasted
only
a
moment
then
a
thought
struck
me
and
i
sprang
up
and
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
dazed
the
whole
thing
was
just
another
trick
i
should
not
have
been
invited
if
i
had
not
happened
to
be
there
when
the
others
were
asked
and
moreover
she
had
given
me
the
plainest
possible
hint
to
stay
away
to
send
a
note
at
the
last
moment
making
some
excuse
i
did
not
sleep
all
that
night
and
when
morning
came
i
went
to
the
woods
cold
sleepless
and
feverish
ho
having
a
party
at
sirilund
what
then
i
would
neither
go
nor
send
any
excuse
herr
mack
was
a
very
thoughtful
man
he
was
giving
this
party
for
the
baron
but
i
was
not
going
let
them
understand
that
the
mist
lay
thick
over
valley
and
hills
a
clammy
rime
gathered
on
my
clothes
and
made
them
heavy
my
face
was
cold
and
wet
only
now
and
then
came
a
breath
of
wind
to
make
the
sleeping
mists
rise
and
fall
rise
and
fall
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
getting
dark
the
mist
hid
everything
from
my
eyes
and
i
had
no
sun
to
show
the
way
i
drifted
about
for
hours
on
the
way
home
but
there
was
no
hurry
i
took
the
wrong
road
with
the
greatest
calmness
and
came
upon
unknown
places
in
the
woods
at
last
i
stood
my
gun
against
a
tree
and
consulted
my
compass
i
marked
out
my
way
carefully
and
started
off
it
would
be
about
eight
or
nine
then
something
happened
after
half
an
hour
i
heard
music
through
the
fog
and
a
few
minutes
later
i
knew
where
i
was
quite
close
to
the
main
building
at
sirilund
had
my
compass
misled
me
to
the
very
place
i
was
trying
to
avoid
a
voice
called
me
the
doctor
a
minute
later
i
was
being
led
in
my
had
perhaps
affected
the
compass
and
alas
set
it
wrong
the
same
thing
has
happened
to
me
since
one
day
this
year
i
do
not
know
what
to
think
then
too
it
may
have
been
fate
xxvi
all
the
evening
i
had
a
bitter
feeling
that
i
should
not
have
come
to
that
party
my
coming
was
hardly
noticed
at
all
they
were
all
so
occupied
with
one
another
edwarda
hardly
bade
me
welcome
i
began
drinking
hard
because
i
knew
i
was
unwelcome
and
yet
i
did
not
go
away
herr
mack
smiled
a
great
deal
and
put
on
his
most
amiable
expression
he
was
in
evening
dress
and
looked
well
he
was
now
here
now
there
mingling
with
his
half
a
hundred
guests
dancing
one
dance
now
and
then
joking
and
laughing
there
were
secrets
lurking
in
his
eyes
a
whirl
of
music
and
voices
sounded
through
the
house
five
of
the
rooms
were
occupied
by
the
guests
besides
the
big
room
where
they
were
dancing
supper
was
over
when
i
arrived
busy
maids
were
running
to
and
fro
with
glasses
and
wines
brightly
polished
cigars
and
pipes
cakes
and
fruit
there
was
no
sparing
of
anything
the
chandeliers
in
the
rooms
were
filled
with
candles
that
had
been
made
for
the
occasion
the
new
oil
lamps
were
lit
as
well
eva
was
helping
in
the
kitchen
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
to
think
that
eva
should
be
here
too
the
baron
received
a
great
deal
of
attention
though
he
was
quiet
and
modest
and
did
not
put
himself
forward
he
too
was
in
evening
dress
the
tails
of
his
coat
were
miserably
crushed
from
the
packing
he
talked
a
good
deal
with
edwarda
followed
her
with
his
eyes
drank
with
her
and
called
her
fröken
as
he
did
the
daughters
of
the
dean
and
of
the
district
surgeon
i
felt
the
same
dislike
of
him
as
before
and
could
hardly
look
at
him
without
turning
my
eyes
away
with
a
wretched
silly
grimace
when
he
spoke
to
me
i
answered
shortly
and
pressed
my
lips
together
after
i
happen
to
remember
one
detail
of
that
evening
i
stood
talking
to
a
young
lady
a
girl
and
i
said
something
or
told
some
story
that
made
her
laugh
it
can
hardly
have
been
anything
remarkable
but
perhaps
in
my
excited
state
i
told
it
more
amusingly
than
i
remember
now
at
any
rate
i
have
forgotten
it
but
when
i
turned
round
there
was
edwarda
standing
behind
me
she
gave
me
a
glance
of
recognition
afterwards
i
noticed
that
she
drew
the
fair
girl
aside
to
find
out
what
i
had
said
i
can
not
say
how
that
look
of
edwarda
cheered
me
after
i
had
been
going
about
from
room
to
room
like
a
sort
of
outcast
all
the
evening
i
felt
better
at
once
and
spoke
to
several
people
and
was
entertaining
as
far
as
i
am
aware
i
did
nothing
awkward
or
wrong
i
was
standing
outside
on
the
steps
eva
came
carrying
some
things
from
one
of
the
rooms
she
saw
me
came
out
and
touched
my
hands
swiftly
with
one
of
hers
then
she
smiled
and
went
in
again
neither
of
us
had
spoken
when
i
turned
to
go
in
after
her
there
was
edwarda
in
the
passage
watching
me
she
also
said
nothing
i
went
into
the
room
fancy
lieutenant
glahn
amuses
himself
having
meetings
with
the
servants
on
the
steps
said
edwarda
suddenly
out
loud
she
was
standing
in
the
doorway
several
heard
what
she
said
she
laughed
as
if
speaking
in
jest
but
her
face
was
very
pale
i
made
no
answer
to
this
i
only
murmured
it
was
accidental
she
just
came
out
and
we
met
in
the
passage
some
time
passed
an
hour
perhaps
a
glass
was
upset
over
a
dress
as
soon
as
edwarda
saw
it
she
cried
what
has
happened
that
was
glahn
of
i
had
not
done
it
i
was
standing
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
when
it
happened
after
that
i
drank
pretty
hard
again
and
kept
near
the
door
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
the
dancers
the
baron
still
had
the
ladies
constantly
round
him
he
regretted
that
his
collections
were
packed
away
so
that
he
could
not
show
them
that
bunch
of
weed
from
the
white
sea
the
clay
from
korholmerne
highly
interesting
stone
formations
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
the
ladies
peeped
curiously
at
his
shirt
studs
the
coronets
they
meant
that
he
was
a
baron
of
course
all
this
time
the
doctor
created
no
sensation
even
his
witty
oath
og
no
longer
had
any
effect
but
when
edwarda
was
speaking
he
was
always
on
the
spot
correcting
her
language
embarrassing
her
with
little
shades
of
meaning
keeping
her
down
with
calm
superiority
she
said
until
i
go
over
the
valley
of
and
the
doctor
asked
over
what
the
valley
of
death
is
that
what
it
called
the
valley
of
death
i
have
heard
of
the
river
of
death
i
presume
that
is
what
you
later
on
she
talked
of
having
something
guarded
like
a
dragon
put
in
the
doctor
yes
like
a
dragon
she
answered
but
the
doctor
said
you
can
thank
me
for
saving
you
there
i
am
sure
you
were
going
to
say
the
baron
raised
his
eyebrows
and
looked
at
the
doctor
in
surprise
through
his
thick
glasses
as
if
he
had
never
heard
such
ridiculous
things
but
the
doctor
paid
no
heed
what
did
he
care
for
the
baron
i
still
lurked
by
the
door
the
dancers
swept
through
the
room
i
managed
to
start
a
conversation
with
the
governess
from
the
vicarage
we
talked
about
the
war
the
state
of
affairs
in
the
crimea
the
happenings
in
france
napoleon
as
emperor
his
protection
of
the
turks
the
young
lady
had
read
the
papers
that
summer
and
could
tell
me
the
news
at
last
we
sat
down
on
a
sofa
and
went
on
talking
edwarda
passing
stopped
in
front
of
us
suddenly
she
said
you
must
forgive
me
lieutenant
for
surprising
you
outside
like
that
i
will
never
do
it
and
she
laughed
again
and
did
not
look
at
me
edwarda
i
said
do
she
had
spoken
very
formally
which
meant
no
good
and
her
look
was
malicious
i
thought
of
the
doctor
and
shrugged
my
shoulders
carelessly
as
he
would
have
done
she
said
but
why
do
you
go
out
in
the
kitchen
eva
is
there
i
think
you
ought
to
stay
and
there
was
hate
in
her
eyes
i
had
not
been
to
parties
often
certainly
i
had
never
before
heard
such
a
tone
at
any
of
the
few
i
had
been
to
i
said
are
you
afraid
of
being
misunderstood
edwarda
oh
but
how
possibly
of
course
but
how
you
sometimes
speak
without
thinking
just
now
for
instance
it
to
me
as
if
you
were
actually
telling
me
to
go
to
the
kitchen
and
stay
there
and
that
of
course
must
be
a
misunderstanding
i
know
quite
well
that
you
did
not
intend
to
be
so
she
walked
a
few
paces
away
from
us
i
could
see
by
her
manner
that
she
was
thinking
all
the
time
of
what
i
had
said
she
turned
round
came
back
and
said
breathlessly
it
was
no
misunderstanding
lieutenant
you
heard
correctly
i
did
tell
you
to
go
to
the
oh
edwarda
broke
out
the
terrified
governess
and
i
began
talking
again
about
the
war
and
the
state
of
affairs
in
the
crimea
but
my
thoughts
were
far
distant
i
was
no
longer
intoxicated
only
hopelessly
confused
the
earth
seemed
fading
from
under
my
feet
and
i
lost
my
composure
as
at
so
many
unfortunate
times
before
i
got
up
from
the
sofa
and
made
as
if
to
go
out
the
doctor
stopped
me
i
have
just
been
hearing
your
praises
he
said
praises
from
whom
from
edwarda
she
is
still
standing
away
off
there
in
the
corner
looking
at
you
with
glowing
eyes
i
shall
never
forget
it
her
eyes
were
absolutely
in
love
and
she
said
out
loud
that
she
admired
good
i
said
with
a
laugh
alas
there
was
not
a
clear
thought
in
my
head
i
went
up
to
the
baron
bent
over
him
as
if
to
whisper
something
and
when
i
was
close
enough
i
spat
in
his
ear
he
sprang
up
and
stared
idiotically
at
me
afterwards
i
saw
him
telling
edwarda
what
had
occurred
i
saw
how
disgusted
she
was
she
thought
perhaps
of
her
shoe
that
i
had
thrown
into
the
water
of
the
cups
and
glasses
i
had
so
unfortunately
managed
to
break
and
of
all
the
other
breaches
of
good
taste
i
had
committed
doubtless
all
those
things
flashed
into
her
mind
again
i
was
ashamed
it
was
all
over
with
me
whichever
way
i
turned
i
met
frightened
and
astonished
looks
and
i
stole
away
from
sirilund
without
a
word
of
or
of
thanks
xxvii
the
baron
is
going
away
well
and
good
i
will
load
my
gun
go
up
into
the
hills
and
fire
a
salvo
in
his
honour
and
edwarda
i
will
bore
a
deep
hole
in
a
rock
and
blow
up
a
mountain
in
his
honour
and
edwarda
and
a
great
boulder
shall
roll
down
the
hillside
and
dash
mightily
into
the
sea
just
as
his
ship
is
passing
by
i
know
a
spot
a
channel
down
the
hillside
where
rocks
have
rolled
before
and
made
a
clean
road
to
the
sea
far
below
there
is
a
little
two
mining
drills
i
say
to
the
smith
and
the
smith
whets
two
drills

has
been
put
to
driving
back
and
forth
between
the
mill
and
the
quay

one
of
herr
mack
horses

has
to
do
a
man

sacks
of
corn
and
flour

fresh
and
glowing

evening

die
for
it
herr
mack
grows
harsher
and
harsher
every
day
but
i
do
not
mind
it
he
is
furious
but
i
do
not
answer
him
he
took
hold
of
my
arm
and
went
grey
with
fury
one
thing
troubles
and
what
is
it
that
troubles
you
herr
mack
threatens
you
he
says
to
me
it
that
lieutenant
you
got
in
your
head
all
the
time
i
answer
i
am
his
then
he
says
you
wait
i
soon
get
rid
of
him
he
said
that
it
does
matter
let
him
threaten
and
with
closed
eyes
she
throws
her
arms
about
my
neck
a
quiver
passes
through
her
the
horse
stands
waiting
xxviii
i
sit
up
in
the
hills
mining
the
autumn
air
is
crystal
about
me
the
strokes
of
my
drill
ring
steady
and
even
æsop
looks
at
me
with
wondering
eyes
wave
after
wave
of
content
swells
through
my
breast
no
one
knows
that
i
am
here
among
the
lonely
hills
the
birds
of
passage
have
gone
a
happy
journey
and
welcome
back
again
titmouse
and
blackcap
and
a
or
so
live
now
alone
in
the
bush
and
undergrowth
tuitui
all
is
so
curiously
changed
the
dwarf
birch
bleeds
redly
against
the
grey
stones
a
harebell
here
and
there
shows
among
the
heather
swaying
and
whispering
a
little
song
sh
but
high
above
all
hovers
an
eagle
with
outstretched
neck
on
his
way
to
the
inland
ridges
and
the
evening
comes
i
lay
my
drill
and
my
hammer
in
under
the
rock
and
stop
to
rest
all
things
are
glooming
now
the
moon
glides
up
in
the
north
the
rocks
cast
gigantic
shadows
the
moon
is
full
it
looks
like
a
glowing
island
like
a
round
riddle
of
brass
that
i
pass
by
and
wonder
at
æsop
gets
up
and
is
restless
what
is
it
æsop
as
for
me
i
am
tired
of
my
sorrow
i
will
forget
it
drown
it
lie
still
æsop
i
tell
you
i
will
not
be
pestered
eva
asks
you
think
of
me
sometimes
i
answer
eva
asks
again
is
it
any
joy
to
you
to
think
of
me
i
answer
a
joy
never
anything
but
a
joy
then
says
eva
hair
is
turning
grey
i
answer
it
is
beginning
to
turn
grey
but
eva
says
it
something
you
think
about
that
is
turning
it
grey
and
to
that
i
answer
at
last
eva
says
you
do
not
think
only
of
me
æsop
lie
still
i
will
tell
you
about
something
else
instead
but
æsop
stands
sniffing
excitedly
down
towards
the
valley
pointing
and
dragging
at
my
clothes
when
at
last
i
get
up
and
follow
he
can
not
get
along
fast
enough
a
flush
of
red
shows
in
the
sky
above
the
woods
i
go
on
faster
and
there
before
my
eyes
is
a
glow
a
huge
fire
i
stop
and
stare
at
it
go
on
a
few
steps
and
stare
again
my
hut
is
ablaze
xxix
the
fire
was
herr
mack
doing
i
saw
through
it
from
the
first
i
lost
my
skins
and
my
birds
wings
i
lost
my
stuffed
eagle
everything
was
destroyed
what
now
i
lay
out
for
two
nights
under
the
open
sky
without
going
to
sirilund
to
ask
for
shelter
at
last
i
rented
a
deserted
by
the
quay
i
stopped
the
cracks
with
dried
moss
and
slept
on
a
load
of
red
horseberry
ling
from
the
hills
once
more
my
needs
were
filled
edwarda
sent
me
a
message
to
say
she
had
heard
of
my
misfortune
and
that
she
offered
me
on
her
father
behalf
a
room
at
sirilund
edwarda
touched
edwarda
generous
i
sent
no
answer
thank
heaven
i
was
no
longer
without
shelter
and
it
gave
me
a
proud
joy
to
make
no
answer
to
edwarda
offer
i
met
her
on
the
road
with
the
baron
they
were
walking
arm
in
arm
i
looked
them
both
in
the
face
and
bowed
as
i
passed
she
stopped
and
asked
so
you
will
not
come
and
stay
with
us
lieutenant
i
am
already
settled
in
my
new
place
i
said
and
stopped
also
she
looked
at
me
her
bosom
was
heaving
you
would
have
lost
nothing
by
coming
to
us
she
said
thankfulness
moved
in
my
heart
but
i
could
not
speak
the
baron
walked
on
slowly
perhaps
you
do
not
want
to
see
me
any
more
she
said
i
thank
you
edwarda
for
offering
me
shelter
when
my
house
was
burned
i
said
it
was
the
kinder
of
you
since
your
father
was
hardly
and
with
bared
head
i
thanked
her
for
her
offer
in
god
name
will
you
not
see
me
again
glahn
she
said
suddenly
the
baron
was
calling
the
baron
is
calling
i
said
and
took
off
my
hat
again
respectfully
and
i
went
up
into
the
hills
to
my
mining
nothing
nothing
should
make
me
lose
my
any
more
i
met
eva
there
what
did
i
say
i
cried
herr
mack
can
not
drive
me
away
he
has
burned
my
hut
and
i
already
have
another
hut
she
was
carrying
a
and
brush
what
now
eva
herr
mack
had
a
boat
in
a
shed
under
the
cliff
and
had
ordered
her
to
tar
it
he
watched
her
every
step
she
had
to
obey
but
why
in
the
shed
there
why
not
at
the
quay
herr
mack
ordered
it
eva
eva
my
love
they
make
a
slave
of
you
and
you
do
not
complain
see
now
you
are
smiling
again
and
life
streams
through
your
smile
for
all
that
you
are
a
when
i
got
up
to
my
mining
work
i
found
a
surprise
i
could
see
that
someone
had
been
on
the
spot
i
examined
the
tracks
and
recognised
the
print
of
herr
mack
long
pointed
shoes
what
could
he
be
ferreting
about
here
for
i
thought
to
myself
and
looked
round
no
one
to
be
seen
i
had
no
suspicion
and
i
fell
to
hammering
with
my
drill
never
dreaming
what
harm
i
did
xxx
the
came
it
brought
my
uniform
it
was
to
take
the
baron
and
all
his
cases
of
scales
and
seaweeds
on
board
now
it
was
loading
up
barrels
of
herrings
and
oil
at
the
quay
towards
evening
it
would
be
off
again
i
took
my
gun
and
put
a
heavy
load
of
powder
in
each
barrel
when
i
had
done
that
i
nodded
to
myself
i
went
up
into
the
hills
and
filled
my
mine
with
powder
as
well
i
nodded
again
now
everything
was
ready
i
lay
down
to
wait
i
waited
for
hours
all
the
time
i
could
hear
the
steamer
winches
at
work
hoisting
and
lowering
it
was
already
growing
dusk
at
last
the
whistle
sounded
the
cargo
was
on
board
the
ship
was
putting
off
i
still
had
some
minutes
to
wait
the
moon
was
not
up
and
i
stared
like
a
madman
through
the
gloom
of
the
evening
when
the
first
point
of
the
bow
thrust
out
past
the
islet
i
lit
my
slow
match
and
stepped
hurriedly
away
a
minute
passed
suddenly
there
was
a
roar
a
spurt
of
stone
fragments
in
the
air
the
hillside
trembled
and
the
rock
hurtled
crashing
down
the
abyss
the
hills
all
round
gave
echo
i
picked
up
my
gun
and
fired
off
one
barrel
the
echo
answered
time
and
time
again
after
a
moment
i
fired
the
second
barrel
too
the
air
trembled
at
the
salute
and
the
echo
flung
the
noise
out
into
the
wide
world
it
was
as
if
all
the
hills
had
united
in
a
shout
for
the
vessel
sailing
away
a
little
time
passed
the
air
grew
still
the
echoes
died
away
in
all
the
hills
and
earth
lay
silent
again
the
ship
disappeared
in
the
gloom
i
was
still
trembling
with
a
strange
excitement
i
took
my
drills
and
my
gun
under
my
arm
and
set
off
with
slack
knees
down
the
hillside
i
took
the
shortest
way
marking
the
smoking
track
left
by
my
avalanche
æsop
followed
me
shaking
his
head
all
the
time
and
sneezing
at
the
smell
of
burning
when
i
came
down
to
the
shed
i
found
a
sight
that
filled
me
with
violent
emotion
a
boat
lay
there
crushed
by
the
falling
rock
and
eva
eva
lay
beside
it
mangled
and
broken
dashed
to
pieces
by
the
shock
torn
beyond
recognition
eva
lying
there
dead
xxxi
what
more
have
i
to
write
i
fired
no
shot
for
many
days
i
had
no
food
and
did
not
eat
at
all
i
sat
in
my
shed
eva
was
carried
to
the
church
in
herr
mack
i
went
there
overland
on
foot
eva
is
dead
do
you
remember
her
little
girlish
head
with
hair
like
a
nun
she
came
so
quietly
laid
down
her
head
and
smiled
and
did
you
see
how
full
of
life
that
smile
was
be
still
æsop
i
remember
a
strange
saga
story
of
four
generations
ago
of
iselin
time
when
stamer
was
a
priest
a
girl
sat
captive
in
a
stone
tower
she
loved
a
lord
why
ask
the
winds
and
the
stars
ask
the
god
of
life
for
there
is
none
that
knows
such
things
the
lord
was
her
friend
and
lover
but
time
went
on
and
one
fine
day
he
saw
another
and
his
liking
changed
like
a
youth
he
loved
his
maid
often
he
called
her
his
blessing
and
his
dove
and
said
give
me
your
heart
and
she
did
so
he
said
may
i
ask
for
something
love
and
wild
with
joy
she
answered
and
she
gave
him
all
and
yet
he
did
not
thank
her
the
other
he
loved
as
a
slave
as
a
madman
and
a
beggar
why
ask
the
dust
of
the
road
and
the
leaves
that
fall
ask
the
mysterious
god
of
life
for
there
is
no
other
that
knows
such
things
she
gave
him
nothing
no
nothing
did
she
give
him
and
yet
he
thanked
her
she
said
give
me
your
peace
and
your
understanding
and
he
was
only
sorry
that
she
did
not
ask
his
life
and
his
maid
was
set
in
the
tower
what
do
you
there
maiden
sitting
and
smiling
i
think
of
something
ten
years
back
it
was
then
i
met
you
remember
him
still
i
remember
him
and
time
goes
on
what
do
you
there
maiden
and
why
do
you
sit
and
smile
i
am
embroidering
his
name
on
a
whose
name
his
who
shut
you
up
here
yes
the
one
i
met
twenty
years
you
remember
him
still
i
remember
him
as
i
did
and
time
goes
on
what
do
you
there
prisoner
i
grow
old
and
can
no
longer
see
to
sew
i
scrape
the
plaster
from
the
walls
and
of
that
i
am
making
an
urn
to
be
a
little
gift
for
of
whom
are
you
speaking
of
my
lover
who
shut
me
in
the
and
do
you
smile
at
that
because
he
locked
you
in
the
tower
i
am
thinking
of
what
he
will
say
now
look
he
will
say
maiden
has
sent
me
a
little
urn
she
has
not
forgotten
me
in
thirty
years
and
time
goes
on
what
prisoner
sit
you
there
idle
and
smile
i
grow
old
i
grow
old
my
eyes
are
blind
i
am
only
of
him
that
you
met
forty
years
ago
of
him
whom
i
met
when
i
was
young
maybe
it
was
forty
years
but
do
you
not
know
then
that
he
is
dead
pale
beldam
you
do
not
answer
your
lips
are
white
you
breathe
no
more
there
that
was
the
strange
tale
of
the
girl
in
the
tower
wait
æsop
wait
a
little
there
was
something
i
forgot
one
day
she
heard
her
lover
voice
in
the
courtyard
and
she
fell
on
her
knees
and
blushed
and
that
was
when
she
was
forty
years
i
bury
you
eva
and
in
humility
kiss
the
sand
above
your
grave
a
luxuriant
memory
flowers
in
me
when
i
think
of
you
i
am
as
if
drenched
in
blessing
at
the
memory
of
your
smile
you
gave
all
all
did
you
give
and
it
cost
you
nothing
for
you
were
the
wild
child
of
life
itself
but
others
the
miserly
ones
who
begrudge
even
a
glance
can
have
all
my
thoughts
why
ask
the
twelve
months
and
the
ships
on
the
sea
ask
the
mysterious
god
of
the
heart
xxxii
a
man
said
you
never
go
out
shooting
now
æsop
is
running
loose
in
the
woods
he
is
after
a
i
said
go
and
shoot
it
for
some
days
passed
herr
mack
looked
me
up
he
was
his
face
was
grey
i
thought
is
it
true
that
i
can
see
through
my
fellows
or
is
it
not
i
do
not
know
myself
herr
mack
spoke
of
the
landslip
the
catastrophe
it
was
a
misfortune
a
sad
accident
i
was
in
no
way
to
blame
i
said
if
it
was
someone
who
wished
to
separate
eva
and
me
at
any
price
he
has
gained
his
end
god
curse
be
on
him
herr
mack
looked
at
me
suspiciously
he
murmured
something
about
the
fine
funeral
nothing
had
been
spared
i
sat
admiring
the
alertness
of
his
mind
he
would
have
no
compensation
for
the
boat
that
my
landslide
had
crushed
oh
but
surely
i
said
will
you
not
have
some
payment
for
the
boat
and
the
and
the
brush
no
my
dear
lieutenant
he
answered
how
could
you
think
of
such
a
thing
and
he
looked
at
me
with
hatred
in
his
eyes
for
three
weeks
i
saw
nothing
of
edwarda
yes
once
i
met
her
at
the
store
when
i
went
to
buy
some
bread
she
stood
inside
the
counter
looking
over
some
different
sorts
of
cloth
stuff
only
the
two
assistants
were
there
besides
i
greeted
her
aloud
and
she
looked
up
but
did
not
answer
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
could
not
ask
for
bread
while
she
was
there
i
turned
to
the
assistants
and
asked
for
powder
and
shot
while
they
were
weighing
it
out
i
watched
her
a
grey
dress
much
too
small
for
her
with
the
buttonholes
worn
her
flat
breast
heaved
restlessly
how
she
had
grown
that
summer
her
brow
was
knit
in
thought
those
strangely
curved
eyebrows
stood
in
her
face
like
two
riddles
all
her
movements
were
grown
more
mature
i
looked
at
her
hands
the
contour
of
her
long
delicate
fingers
moved
me
violently
made
me
tremble
she
was
still
turning
over
the
stuffs
i
stood
wishing
that
æsop
would
run
to
her
behind
the
counter
then
i
could
call
him
back
at
once
and
apologise
what
would
she
say
then
here
you
are
said
the
storekeeper
i
paid
for
the
things
took
up
my
parcels
and
took
my
leave
of
her
she
looked
up
but
again
without
speaking
good
i
thought
to
myself
she
is
the
baron
bride
already
as
like
as
not
and
i
went
without
my
bread
when
i
got
outside
i
looked
up
at
the
window
no
one
was
watching
me
xxxiii
then
one
night
the
snow
came
and
it
began
to
be
cold
in
my
hut
there
was
a
fireplace
where
i
cooked
my
food
but
the
wood
burned
poorly
and
it
was
very
draughty
though
i
had
caulked
the
walls
as
well
as
i
could
the
autumn
was
past
and
the
days
were
growing
shorter
the
first
snow
was
still
melting
under
the
rays
of
the
sun
presently
the
ground
was
bare
again
but
the
nights
were
cold
and
the
water
froze
and
all
the
grass
and
all
the
insects
died
a
secret
stillness
fell
upon
people
they
pondered
and
were
silent
their
eyes
awaited
the
winter
no
more
calling
from
the
drying
grounds
the
harbour
lay
quiet
everything
was
moving
towards
the
eternal
winter
of
the
northern
lights
when
the
sun
sleeps
in
the
sea
dull
came
the
sound
of
the
oars
from
a
lonely
boat
a
girl
came
rowing
where
have
you
been
my
girl
nowhere
look
i
recognize
you
i
met
you
last
she
brought
the
boat
in
stepped
ashore
made
fast
you
were
herding
goats
you
stopped
to
fasten
your
stocking
i
met
you
one
a
little
flush
rose
to
her
cheeks
and
she
laughed
shyly
little
come
into
the
hut
and
let
me
look
at
you
i
knew
your
name
too
it
is
but
she
walked
past
me
without
speaking
the
autumn
the
winter
had
laid
hold
of
her
too
her
senses
drowsed
already
the
sun
had
gone
to
sea
xxxiv
and
i
put
on
my
uniform
for
the
first
time
and
went
down
to
sirilund
my
heart
was
beating
i
remembered
everything
from
the
day
when
edwarda
had
come
hurrying
to
me
and
embraced
me
before
them
all
now
she
had
thrown
me
hither
and
thither
for
many
months
and
made
my
hair
turn
grey
my
own
fault
yes
my
star
had
led
me
astray
i
thought
how
she
would
chuckle
if
i
were
to
throw
myself
at
her
feet
and
tell
her
the
secret
of
my
heart
she
would
offer
me
a
chair
and
have
wine
brought
in
and
just
as
she
was
raising
the
glass
to
her
lips
to
drink
with
me
she
would
say
lieutenant
i
thank
you
for
the
time
we
have
been
together
i
shall
never
forget
it
but
when
i
grew
glad
and
felt
a
little
hope
pretend
to
drink
and
set
down
the
glass
untouched
and
she
hide
from
me
that
she
only
been
pretending
to
drink
she
be
careful
to
let
me
see
it
that
was
her
way
good
it
was
nearing
the
last
hour
now
and
as
i
walked
down
the
road
i
thought
further
my
uniform
will
impress
her
the
trappings
are
new
and
handsome
the
sword
will
rattle
against
the
floor
a
nervous
joy
thrilled
me
and
i
whispered
to
myself
who
knows
what
may
happen
yet
i
raised
my
head
and
threw
out
a
hand
no
more
humility
now
a
man
honour
and
pride
whatever
came
of
it
i
would
make
no
more
advances
now
pardon
me
my
fair
one
for
not
asking
your
hand
herr
mack
met
me
in
the
courtyard
greyer
still
more
going
away
so
i
suppose
you
not
been
very
comfortable
lately
eh
your
hut
burned
down
and
herr
mack
smiled
in
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
the
wisest
man
in
the
world
stood
before
my
eyes
go
indoors
lieutenant
edwarda
is
there
well
i
will
say
see
you
on
the
quay
i
suppose
when
the
vessel
he
walked
off
with
head
bowed
in
thought
whistling
edwarda
was
sitting
indoors
reading
at
the
instant
of
my
entering
she
started
at
my
uniform
she
looked
at
me
sideways
like
a
bird
and
even
blushed
she
opened
her
mouth
i
have
come
to
say
i
managed
to
get
out
at
last
she
rose
quickly
to
her
feet
and
i
saw
that
my
words
had
had
some
effect
glahn
are
you
going
away
now
as
soon
as
the
boat
i
grasped
her
hand
both
her
hands
a
senseless
delight
took
possession
of
me
i
burst
out
edwarda
and
stared
at
her
and
in
a
moment
she
was
cold
cold
and
defiant
her
whole
being
resisted
me
she
drew
herself
up
i
found
myself
standing
like
a
beggar
before
her
i
loosed
her
hand
and
let
her
go
i
remember
that
from
that
moment
i
stood
repeating
mechanically
edwarda
edwarda
again
and
again
without
thinking
and
when
she
asked
yes
what
were
you
going
to
say
i
explained
nothing
to
think
you
are
going
already
she
said
again
who
will
come
next
year
i
wonder
another
i
answered
the
hut
will
be
built
up
again
no
pause
she
was
already
reaching
for
her
book
i
am
sorry
my
father
is
not
in
she
said
but
i
will
tell
him
you
were
i
made
no
answer
to
this
i
stepped
forward
took
her
hand
once
more
and
said
farvel
farvel
she
answered
i
opened
the
door
as
if
to
go
already
she
was
sitting
with
the
book
in
her
hand
reading
actually
reading
and
turning
the
page
nothing
affected
not
the
least
in
the
world
affected
by
my
saying
i
coughed
she
turned
and
said
in
surprise
oh
are
you
not
gone
i
thought
you
heaven
alone
knows
but
it
struck
me
that
her
surprise
was
too
great
that
she
was
not
careful
that
she
overdid
it
and
it
came
into
my
head
that
perhaps
she
had
known
all
the
time
that
i
was
standing
behind
her
i
am
going
now
i
said
then
she
rose
and
came
over
to
me
i
should
like
to
have
something
to
remember
you
by
when
you
go
she
said
i
thought
of
asking
you
for
something
but
perhaps
it
is
too
much
will
you
give
me
æsop
i
did
not
hesitate
i
answered
then
perhaps
you
would
come
and
bring
him
she
said
i
went
i
looked
up
at
the
window
no
one
there
it
was
all
over
now
the
last
night
in
the
hut
i
sat
in
thought
i
counted
the
hours
when
the
morning
came
i
made
ready
my
last
meal
it
was
a
cold
day
why
had
she
asked
me
to
come
myself
and
bring
the
dog
would
she
tell
me
something
speak
to
me
for
the
last
time
i
had
nothing
more
to
hope
for
and
how
would
she
treat
æsop
æsop
æsop
she
will
torture
you
for
my
sake
she
will
whip
you
caress
you
too
perhaps
but
certainly
whip
you
with
and
without
reason
ruin
you
altogether
i
called
æsop
to
me
patted
him
put
our
two
heads
together
and
picked
up
my
gun
he
was
already
whining
with
pleasure
thinking
we
were
going
out
after
game
i
put
our
heads
together
once
more
i
laid
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
against
æsop
neck
and
fired
i
hired
a
man
to
carry
æsop
body
to
edwarda
xxxv
the
was
to
sail
in
the
afternoon
i
went
down
to
the
quay
my
things
were
already
on
board
herr
mack
pressed
my
hand
and
said
encouragingly
that
it
would
be
nice
weather
pleasant
weather
he
would
not
mind
making
the
trip
himself
in
such
weather
the
doctor
came
walking
down
edwarda
was
with
him
i
felt
my
knees
beginning
to
tremble
came
to
see
you
safely
off
said
the
doctor
i
thanked
him
edwarda
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
and
said
i
must
thank
you
for
your
she
pressed
her
lips
together
they
were
quite
white
again
she
had
called
me
footnote
the
most
formal
mode
of
address
when
does
the
boat
go
the
doctor
asked
a
man
in
half
an
i
said
nothing
edwarda
was
turning
restlessly
this
way
and
that
doctor
do
you
think
we
may
as
well
go
home
again
she
said
i
have
done
what
i
came
for
to
you
have
done
what
you
came
said
the
doctor
she
laughed
humiliated
by
his
everlasting
correction
and
answered
was
that
almost
what
i
said
no
he
answered
shortly
i
looked
at
him
the
little
man
stood
there
cold
and
firm
he
had
made
a
plan
and
he
carried
it
out
to
the
last
and
if
he
lost
after
all
in
any
case
he
would
never
show
it
his
face
never
betrayed
him
it
was
getting
dusk
well
i
said
and
thanks
for
edwarda
looked
at
me
dumbly
then
she
turned
her
head
and
stood
looking
out
at
the
ship
i
got
into
the
boat
edwarda
was
still
standing
on
the
quay
when
i
got
on
board
the
doctor
called
out
i
looked
over
to
the
shore
edwarda
turned
at
the
same
time
and
walked
hurriedly
away
from
the
quay
the
doctor
far
behind
that
was
the
last
i
saw
of
her
a
wave
of
sadness
went
through
my
heart
the
vessel
began
to
move
i
could
still
see
herr
mack
sign
salt
and
but
soon
it
disappeared
the
moon
and
the
stars
came
out
the
hills
towered
round
about
and
i
saw
the
endless
woods
there
is
the
mill
there
there
stood
my
hut
that
was
burned
the
big
grey
stone
stands
there
all
alone
on
the
site
of
the
fire
iselin
eva
the
night
of
the
northern
lights
spreads
over
valley
and
hill
xxxvi
i
have
written
this
to
pass
the
time
it
has
amused
me
to
look
back
to
that
summer
in
nordland
when
i
often
counted
the
hours
but
when
time
flew
nevertheless
all
is
changed
the
days
will
no
longer
pass
i
have
many
a
merry
hour
even
yet
but
time
it
stands
still
and
i
can
not
understand
how
it
can
stand
so
still
i
am
out
of
the
service
and
free
as
a
prince
all
is
well
i
meet
people
drive
in
carriages
now
and
again
i
shut
one
eye
and
write
with
one
finger
up
in
the
sky
i
tickle
the
moon
under
the
chin
and
fancy
that
it
laughs
laughs
broadly
at
being
tickled
under
the
chin
all
things
smile
i
pop
a
cork
and
call
gay
people
to
me
as
for
edwarda
i
do
not
think
of
her
why
should
i
not
have
forgotten
her
altogether
after
all
this
time
i
have
some
pride
and
if
anyone
asks
whether
i
have
any
sorrows
then
i
answer
straight
out
no
cora
lies
looking
at
me
æsop
it
used
to
be
but
now
it
is
cora
that
lies
looking
at
me
the
clock
ticks
on
the
mantel
outside
my
open
window
sounds
the
roar
of
the
city
a
knock
at
the
door
and
the
postman
hands
me
a
letter
a
letter
with
a
coronet
i
know
who
sent
it
i
understand
it
at
once
or
maybe
i
dreamed
it
one
sleepless
night
but
in
the
envelope
there
is
no
letter
at
all
only
two
green
bird
feathers
an
icy
horror
thrills
me
i
turn
cold
two
green
feathers
i
say
to
myself
well
and
what
of
it
but
why
should
i
turn
cold
why
there
is
a
cursed
draught
from
those
windows
and
i
shut
the
windows
there
lie
two
bird
feathers
i
think
to
myself
again
i
seem
to
know
them
they
remind
me
of
a
little
jest
up
in
nordland
just
a
little
episode
among
a
host
of
others
it
is
amusing
to
see
those
two
feathers
again
and
suddenly
i
seem
to
see
a
face
and
hear
a
voice
and
the
voice
says
her
herr
lieutenant
here
are
your
your
cora
lie
still
do
you
hear
i
will
kill
you
if
you
move
the
weather
is
hot
an
intolerable
heat
is
in
the
room
what
was
i
thinking
of
to
close
the
windows
open
them
again
open
the
door
too
open
it
wide
this
way
merry
souls
come
in
hey
messenger
an
errand
go
out
and
fetch
me
a
host
of
people
and
the
day
passes
but
time
stands
still
now
i
have
written
this
for
my
own
pleasure
only
and
amused
myself
with
it
as
best
i
could
no
sorrow
weighs
on
me
but
i
long
to
be
away
where
i
do
not
know
but
far
away
perhaps
in
africa
or
india
for
my
place
is
in
the
woods
in
solitude
glahn
death
a
document
of
i
the
glahn
family
can
go
on
advertising
as
long
as
they
please
for
lieutenant
thomas
glahn
who
disappeared
but
he
will
never
come
back
he
is
dead
and
what
is
more
i
know
how
he
died
to
tell
the
truth
i
am
not
surprised
that
his
people
should
still
keep
on
seeking
information
for
thomas
glahn
was
in
many
ways
an
uncommon
and
likable
man
i
admit
this
for
fairness
sake
and
despite
the
fact
that
glahn
is
still
repellant
to
my
soul
so
that
the
bare
memory
of
him
arouses
hatred
he
was
a
splendidly
handsome
man
full
of
youth
and
with
an
irresistible
manner
when
he
looked
at
you
with
his
hot
animal
eyes
you
could
not
but
feel
his
power
even
i
felt
it
so
a
woman
they
say
said
when
he
looks
at
me
i
am
lost
i
feel
a
sensation
as
if
he
were
touching
but
thomas
glahn
had
his
faults
and
i
have
no
intention
of
hiding
them
seeing
that
i
hate
him
he
could
at
times
be
full
of
nonsense
like
a
child
so
kindly
natured
was
he
and
perhaps
it
was
that
which
made
him
so
irresistible
to
women
god
knows
he
could
chat
with
them
and
laugh
at
their
senseless
twaddle
and
so
he
made
an
impression
once
speaking
of
a
very
corpulent
man
in
the
place
he
said
that
he
looked
as
if
he
went
about
with
his
breeches
full
of
lard
and
he
laughed
at
that
joke
himself
though
i
should
have
been
ashamed
of
it
another
time
after
we
had
come
to
live
in
the
same
house
together
he
showed
his
foolishness
in
an
unmistakable
way
my
landlady
came
in
one
morning
and
asked
what
i
would
have
for
breakfast
and
in
my
hurry
i
happened
to
answer
a
bread
and
a
slice
of
thomas
glahn
was
sitting
in
my
room
at
the
time
he
lived
in
the
attic
up
above
just
under
the
roof
and
he
began
to
chuckle
and
laugh
childishly
over
my
little
slip
of
the
tongue
a
bread
and
a
slice
of
egg
he
repeated
time
over
and
over
until
i
looked
at
him
in
surprise
and
made
him
stop
maybe
i
shall
call
to
mind
other
ridiculous
traits
of
his
later
on
if
so
i
will
write
them
down
too
and
not
spare
him
seeing
that
he
is
still
my
enemy
why
should
i
be
generous
but
i
will
admit
that
he
talked
nonsense
only
when
he
was
drunk
but
is
it
not
a
great
mistake
to
be
drunk
at
all
when
i
first
met
him
in
the
autumn
of
he
was
a
man
of
we
were
of
an
age
he
wore
a
full
beard
at
that
time
and
affected
woolen
sports
shirts
with
an
exaggerated
lowness
of
neck
not
content
with
that
he
sometimes
left
the
top
button
undone
his
neck
appeared
to
me
at
first
to
be
remarkably
handsome
but
little
by
little
he
made
me
his
deadly
enemy
and
then
i
did
not
consider
his
neck
handsomer
than
mine
though
i
did
not
show
off
mine
so
openly
i
met
him
first
on
a
river
boat
and
we
were
going
to
the
same
place
on
a
hunting
trip
we
agreed
to
go
together
by
when
we
came
to
the
end
of
the
railway
i
purposely
refrained
from
stating
the
place
we
were
going
to
not
wishing
to
set
anyone
on
the
track
but
the
glahns
can
safely
stop
advertising
for
their
relative
for
he
died
at
the
place
we
went
to
which
i
will
not
name
i
had
heard
of
thomas
glahn
by
the
way
before
i
met
him
his
name
was
not
unknown
to
me
i
had
heard
of
some
affair
of
his
with
a
young
girl
from
nordland
from
a
big
house
there
and
that
he
had
compromised
her
in
some
way
after
which
she
broke
it
off
this
he
had
sworn
in
his
foolish
obstinacy
to
revenge
upon
himself
and
the
lady
calmly
let
him
do
as
he
pleased
in
that
respect
considering
it
no
business
of
hers
from
that
time
onwards
thomas
glahn
name
began
to
be
well
known
he
turned
wild
mad
he
drank
created
scandal
after
scandal
and
resigned
his
commission
in
the
army
a
queer
way
of
taking
vengeance
for
a
refusal
there
was
also
another
story
of
his
relations
with
that
young
lady
to
the
effect
that
he
had
not
compromised
her
in
any
way
but
that
her
people
had
showed
him
the
door
and
that
she
herself
had
helped
in
it
after
a
swedish
count
whose
name
i
will
not
mention
had
proposed
to
her
but
this
account
i
am
less
inclined
to
trust
i
regard
the
first
as
true
for
after
all
i
hate
thomas
glahn
and
believe
him
capable
of
the
worst
but
however
it
may
have
been
he
never
spoke
himself
of
the
affair
with
that
noble
lady
and
i
did
not
ask
him
about
it
what
business
was
it
of
mine
as
we
sat
there
on
the
boat
i
remember
we
talked
about
the
little
village
we
were
making
for
to
which
neither
of
us
had
been
before
there
a
sort
of
hotel
there
i
believe
said
glahn
looking
at
the
map
kept
by
an
old
woman
so
they
say
the
chief
lives
in
the
next
village
and
has
a
heap
of
wives
by
all
accounts
some
of
them
only
ten
years
well
i
knew
nothing
about
the
chief
and
his
wives
or
whether
there
was
a
hotel
in
the
place
so
i
said
nothing
but
glahn
smiled
and
i
thought
his
smile
was
beautiful
i
forgot
by
the
way
that
he
could
not
by
any
means
be
called
a
perfect
man
handsome
though
he
was
he
told
me
himself
that
he
had
an
old
gunshot
wound
in
his
left
foot
and
that
it
was
full
of
gout
whenever
the
weather
changed
ii
a
week
later
we
were
lodged
in
the
big
hut
that
went
by
the
name
of
hotel
with
the
old
english
woman
what
a
hotel
it
was
the
walls
were
of
clay
with
a
little
wood
and
the
wood
was
eaten
through
by
the
white
ants
that
crawled
about
everywhere
i
lived
in
a
room
next
the
main
parlor
with
a
green
glass
window
looking
on
to
the
street
a
single
pane
not
very
clear
at
that
and
glahn
had
chosen
a
little
bit
of
a
hole
up
in
the
attic
much
darker
and
a
poor
place
to
live
in
the
sun
heated
the
thatched
roof
and
made
his
room
almost
insufferably
hot
at
night
and
day
besides
which
it
was
not
a
stair
at
all
that
led
up
to
it
but
a
wretched
bit
of
a
ladder
with
four
steps
what
could
i
do
i
let
him
take
his
choice
and
said
here
are
two
rooms
one
upstairs
and
one
down
take
your
and
glahn
looked
at
the
two
rooms
and
took
the
upper
one
possibly
to
give
me
the
better
of
the
two
but
was
i
not
grateful
for
it
i
owe
him
nothing
as
long
as
the
worst
of
the
heat
lasted
we
left
the
hunting
alone
and
stayed
quietly
in
the
hut
for
the
heat
was
extremely
uncomfortable
we
lay
at
night
with
a
mosquito
net
over
the
bedplace
to
keep
off
the
insects
but
even
then
it
happened
sometimes
that
blind
bats
would
come
flying
silently
against
our
nets
and
tear
them
this
happened
too
often
to
glahn
because
he
was
obliged
to
have
a
trap
in
the
roof
open
all
the
time
on
account
of
the
heat
but
it
did
not
happen
to
me
in
the
daytime
we
lay
on
mats
outside
the
hut
and
smoked
and
watched
the
life
about
the
other
huts
the
natives
were
brown
folk
all
with
rings
in
their
ears
and
dead
brown
eyes
they
were
almost
naked
with
just
a
strip
of
cotton
cloth
or
plaited
leaves
round
the
middle
and
the
women
had
also
a
short
petticoat
of
cotton
stuff
to
cover
them
all
the
children
went
about
stark
naked
night
and
day
with
great
big
prominent
bellies
simply
glistening
with
oil
the
women
are
too
fat
said
glahn
and
i
too
thought
the
women
were
too
fat
perhaps
it
was
not
glahn
at
all
but
myself
who
thought
so
first
but
i
will
not
dispute
his
claim
i
am
willing
to
give
him
the
credit
as
a
matter
of
fact
not
all
the
women
were
ugly
though
their
faces
were
fat
and
swollen
i
had
met
a
girl
in
the
village
a
young
with
long
hair
and
teeth
she
was
the
prettiest
of
them
all
i
came
upon
her
one
evening
at
the
edge
of
a
rice
field
she
lay
flat
on
her
face
in
the
high
grass
kicking
her
legs
in
the
air
she
could
talk
to
me
and
we
did
talk
too
as
long
as
i
pleased
glahn
sat
that
evening
in
the
middle
of
our
village
outside
a
hut
with
two
other
girls
very
young
not
more
than
ten
years
old
perhaps
he
sat
there
talking
nonsense
to
them
and
drinking
rice
beer
that
was
the
sort
of
thing
he
liked
a
couple
of
days
later
we
went
out
shooting
we
passed
by
tea
gardens
rice
fields
and
grass
plains
we
left
the
village
behind
us
and
went
in
the
direction
of
the
river
and
came
into
forests
of
strange
foreign
trees
bamboo
and
mango
tamarind
teak
and
salt
trees
oil
and
plants
heaven
knows
what
they
all
were
we
had
between
us
but
little
knowledge
of
the
things
but
there
was
very
little
water
in
the
river
and
so
it
remained
until
the
rainy
season
we
shot
wild
pigeons
and
partridges
and
saw
a
couple
of
panthers
one
afternoon
parrots
too
flew
over
our
heads
glahn
was
a
terribly
accurate
shot
he
never
missed
but
that
was
merely
because
his
gun
was
better
than
mine
many
times
i
too
shot
terribly
accurately
i
never
boasted
of
it
but
glahn
would
often
say
i
get
that
fellow
in
the
tail
or
that
one
in
the
he
would
say
that
before
he
fired
and
when
the
bird
fell
sure
enough
it
was
hit
in
the
tail
or
the
head
as
he
had
said
when
we
came
upon
the
two
panthers
glahn
was
all
for
attacking
them
too
with
his
but
i
persuaded
him
to
give
it
up
as
it
was
getting
dusk
and
we
had
no
more
than
two
or
three
cartridges
left
he
boasted
of
that
too
of
having
had
the
courage
to
attack
panthers
with
a
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
fire
at
them
after
all
he
said
to
me
what
do
you
want
to
be
so
infernally
cautious
for
do
you
want
to
go
on
living
i
glad
you
consider
me
wiser
than
yourself
i
answered
well
do
let
us
quarrel
over
a
trifle
he
said
those
were
his
words
not
mine
if
he
had
wished
to
quarrel
i
for
my
part
had
no
wish
to
prevent
him
i
was
beginning
to
feel
some
dislike
for
him
for
his
incautious
behavior
and
for
his
manner
with
women
only
the
night
before
i
had
been
walking
quietly
along
with
maggie
the
tamil
girl
that
was
my
friend
and
we
were
both
as
happy
as
could
be
glahn
sits
outside
his
hut
and
nods
and
smiles
to
us
as
we
pass
it
was
then
that
maggie
saw
him
for
the
first
time
and
she
was
very
inquisitive
about
him
so
great
an
impression
had
he
made
on
her
that
when
it
was
time
to
go
we
went
each
our
own
way
she
did
not
go
back
home
with
me
glahn
would
have
put
this
by
as
of
no
importance
when
i
spoke
to
him
about
it
but
i
did
not
forget
it
and
it
was
not
to
me
that
he
nodded
and
smiled
as
we
passed
by
the
hut
it
was
to
maggie
what
that
she
chews
he
asked
me
i
do
know
i
answered
she
chews
i
suppose
that
what
her
teeth
are
and
it
was
no
news
to
me
either
that
maggie
was
always
chewing
something
i
had
noticed
it
long
before
but
it
was
not
betel
she
was
chewing
for
her
teeth
were
quite
white
she
had
however
a
habit
of
chewing
all
sorts
of
other
things
putting
them
in
her
mouth
and
chewing
as
if
they
were
something
nice
anything
would
do
a
piece
of
money
a
scrap
of
paper
feathers
she
would
chew
it
all
the
same
still
it
was
nothing
to
reproach
her
for
seeing
that
she
was
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
village
anyway
glahn
was
jealous
of
me
that
was
all
i
was
friends
again
with
maggie
though
next
evening
and
we
saw
nothing
of
glahn
iii
a
week
passed
and
we
went
out
shooting
every
day
and
shot
a
heap
of
game
one
morning
just
as
we
were
entering
the
forest
glahn
gripped
me
by
the
arm
and
whispered
stop
at
the
same
moment
he
threw
up
his
rifle
and
fired
it
was
a
young
leopard
he
had
shot
i
might
have
fired
myself
but
glahn
kept
the
honour
to
himself
and
fired
first
now
boast
of
that
later
on
i
said
to
myself
we
went
up
to
the
dead
beast
it
was
stone
dead
the
left
flank
all
torn
up
and
the
bullet
in
its
back
now
i
do
not
like
being
gripped
by
the
arm
so
i
said
i
could
have
managed
that
shot
glahn
looked
at
me
i
said
you
think
perhaps
i
could
have
done
it
still
glahn
made
no
answer
instead
he
showed
his
childishness
once
more
shooting
the
dead
leopard
again
this
time
through
the
head
i
looked
at
him
in
utter
astonishment
well
you
know
he
explains
i
should
like
to
have
it
said
that
i
shot
a
leopard
in
the
you
are
very
amiable
this
evening
i
said
it
was
too
much
for
his
vanity
to
have
made
such
a
poor
shot
he
must
always
be
first
what
a
fool
he
was
but
it
was
no
business
of
mine
anyway
i
was
not
going
to
show
him
up
in
the
evening
when
we
came
back
to
the
village
with
the
dead
leopard
a
lot
of
the
natives
came
out
to
look
at
it
glahn
simply
said
we
had
shot
it
that
morning
and
made
no
sort
of
fuss
about
it
himself
at
the
time
maggie
came
up
too
who
shot
it
she
asked
and
glahn
answered
you
can
see
for
yourself
twice
hit
we
shot
it
this
morning
when
we
went
and
he
turned
the
beast
over
and
showed
her
the
two
bullet
wounds
both
that
in
the
flank
and
that
in
the
head
that
where
mine
went
he
said
pointing
to
the
side
in
his
idiotic
fashion
he
wanted
me
to
have
the
credit
of
having
shot
it
in
the
head
i
did
not
trouble
to
correct
him
i
said
nothing
after
that
glahn
began
treating
the
natives
with
rice
beer
gave
them
any
amount
of
it
as
many
as
cared
to
drink
both
shot
it
said
maggie
to
herself
but
she
was
looking
at
glahn
all
the
time
i
drew
her
aside
with
me
and
said
what
are
you
looking
at
him
all
the
time
for
i
am
here
too
i
suppose
yes
she
said
and
listen
i
am
coming
this
it
was
the
day
after
this
that
glahn
got
the
letter
there
came
a
letter
for
him
sent
up
by
express
messenger
from
the
river
station
and
it
had
made
a
detour
of
a
hundred
and
eighty
miles
the
letter
was
in
a
woman
hand
and
i
thought
to
my
self
that
perhaps
it
was
from
that
former
friend
of
his
the
noble
lady
glahn
laughed
nervously
when
he
had
read
it
and
gave
the
messenger
extra
money
for
bringing
it
but
it
was
not
long
before
he
turned
silent
and
gloomy
and
did
nothing
but
sit
staring
straight
before
him
that
evening
he
got
drunk
sat
drinking
with
an
old
dwarf
of
a
native
and
his
son
and
clung
hold
of
me
too
and
did
all
he
could
to
make
me
drink
as
well
then
he
laughed
out
loud
and
said
here
we
are
the
two
of
us
miles
away
in
the
middle
of
all
india
shooting
game
what
desperately
funny
is
it
and
hurrah
for
all
the
lands
and
kingdoms
of
the
earth
and
hurrah
for
all
the
pretty
women
married
or
unmarried
far
and
near
hoho
nice
thing
for
a
man
when
a
married
woman
proposes
to
him
is
it
a
married
woman
a
countess
i
said
ironically
i
said
it
very
scornfully
and
that
cut
him
he
grinned
like
a
dog
because
it
hurt
him
then
suddenly
he
wrinkled
his
forehead
and
began
blinking
his
eyes
and
thinking
hard
if
he
had
said
too
much
so
mighty
serious
was
he
about
his
bit
of
a
secret
but
just
then
a
lot
of
children
came
running
over
to
our
hut
and
crying
out
tigers
ohoi
the
tigers
a
child
had
been
snapped
up
by
a
tiger
quite
close
to
the
village
in
a
thicket
between
it
and
the
river
that
was
enough
for
glahn
drunk
as
he
was
and
cut
up
about
something
into
the
bargain
he
picked
up
his
rifle
and
raced
off
at
once
to
the
thicket
did
even
put
on
his
hat
but
why
did
he
take
his
rifle
instead
of
a
if
he
was
really
as
plucky
as
all
that
he
had
to
wade
across
the
river
and
that
was
rather
a
risky
thing
in
itself
but
then
the
river
was
nearly
dry
now
till
the
rains
a
little
later
i
heard
two
shots
and
then
close
on
them
a
third
three
shots
at
a
single
beast
i
thought
why
a
lion
would
have
fallen
for
two
and
this
was
only
a
tiger
but
even
those
three
shots
were
no
use
the
child
was
torn
to
bits
and
half
eaten
by
the
time
glahn
come
up
if
he
had
been
drunk
he
would
have
made
the
attempt
to
save
it
he
spent
the
night
drinking
and
rioting
in
the
hut
next
door
for
two
days
he
was
never
sober
for
a
minute
and
he
had
found
a
lot
of
companions
too
to
drink
with
him
he
begged
me
in
vain
to
take
part
in
the
orgy
he
was
no
longer
careful
of
what
he
said
and
taunted
me
with
being
jealous
of
him
your
jealousy
makes
you
blind
he
said
my
jealousy
i
jealous
of
him
good
lord
i
said
i
jealous
of
you
what
there
for
me
to
be
jealous
about
no
no
of
course
you
not
jealous
of
me
he
answered
i
saw
maggie
this
evening
by
the
way
she
was
chewing
something
as
i
made
no
answer
i
simply
walked
off
iv
we
began
going
out
shooting
again
glahn
felt
he
had
wronged
me
and
begged
my
pardon
and
i
dead
sick
of
the
whole
thing
he
said
i
only
wish
you
make
a
slip
one
day
and
put
a
bullet
in
my
it
was
that
letter
from
the
countess
again
perhaps
that
was
smouldering
in
his
mind
i
answered
as
a
man
soweth
so
shall
he
also
day
by
day
he
grew
more
silent
and
gloomy
he
had
given
up
drinking
now
and
did
say
a
word
either
his
cheeks
grew
hollow
one
day
i
heard
talking
and
laughter
outside
my
window
glahn
had
turned
cheerful
again
and
he
stood
there
talking
out
loud
to
maggie
he
was
getting
in
all
his
fascinating
tricks
maggie
must
have
come
straight
from
her
hut
and
glahn
had
been
watching
and
waiting
for
her
they
even
had
the
nerve
to
stand
there
making
up
together
right
outside
my
glass
window
i
felt
a
trembling
in
all
my
limbs
i
cocked
my
gun
then
i
let
the
hammer
down
again
i
went
outside
and
took
maggie
by
the
arm
we
walked
out
of
the
village
in
silence
glahn
went
back
into
the
hut
again
at
once
what
were
you
talking
with
him
again
for
i
asked
maggie
she
made
no
answer
i
was
thoroughly
desperate
my
heart
beat
so
i
could
hardly
breathe
i
had
never
seen
maggie
look
so
lovely
as
she
did
then
never
seen
a
real
white
girl
so
beautiful
and
i
forgot
she
was
a
tamil
forgot
everything
for
her
sake
answer
me
i
said
what
were
you
talking
to
him
for
i
like
him
best
she
said
you
like
him
better
than
me
oh
indeed
she
liked
him
better
than
me
though
i
was
at
least
as
good
a
man
had
i
always
been
kind
to
her
and
given
her
money
and
presents
and
what
had
he
done
he
makes
fun
of
you
he
says
you
always
chewing
things
i
said
she
did
not
understand
that
and
i
explained
it
better
how
she
had
a
habit
of
putting
everything
in
her
mouth
and
chewing
it
and
how
glahn
laughed
at
her
for
it
that
made
more
impression
on
her
than
all
the
rest
i
said
look
here
maggie
i
went
on
you
shall
be
mine
for
always
you
like
that
i
been
thinking
it
over
you
shall
go
with
me
when
i
leave
here
i
will
marry
you
do
you
hear
and
we
go
to
our
own
country
and
live
there
you
like
that
would
you
and
that
impressed
her
too
maggie
grew
lively
and
talked
a
lot
as
we
walked
she
only
mentioned
glahn
once
she
asked
and
will
glahn
go
with
us
when
we
go
away
no
i
said
he
wo
are
you
sorry
about
that
no
no
she
said
quickly
i
am
she
said
no
more
about
him
and
i
felt
easier
and
maggie
went
home
with
me
too
when
i
asked
her
when
she
went
a
couple
of
hours
later
i
climbed
up
the
ladder
to
glahn
room
and
knocked
at
the
thin
reed
door
he
was
in
i
said
i
came
to
tell
you
that
perhaps
we
better
not
go
out
shooting
why
not
said
glahn
because
i
not
so
sure
but
i
might
make
a
little
mistake
and
put
a
bullet
in
your
glahn
did
not
answer
and
i
went
down
again
after
that
warning
he
would
hardly
dare
to
go
out
but
what
did
he
want
to
get
maggie
out
under
my
window
for
and
fool
with
her
there
at
the
top
of
his
voice
why
did
he
go
back
home
again
if
the
letter
really
asked
him
instead
of
going
about
as
he
often
did
clenching
his
teeth
and
shouting
at
the
empty
air
never
never
i
be
drawn
and
quartered
first
but
the
morning
after
i
had
warned
him
as
i
said
there
was
glahn
the
same
as
ever
standing
by
my
bed
calling
out
up
with
you
comrade
it
a
lovely
day
we
must
go
out
and
shoot
something
that
was
all
nonsense
you
said
it
was
no
more
than
four
but
i
got
up
at
once
and
got
ready
to
go
with
him
in
spite
of
my
warning
i
loaded
my
gun
before
starting
out
and
i
let
him
see
that
i
did
and
it
was
not
at
all
a
lovely
day
as
he
had
said
it
was
raining
which
showed
that
he
was
only
trying
to
irritate
me
the
more
but
i
took
no
notice
and
went
with
him
saying
nothing
all
that
day
we
wandered
round
through
the
forest
each
lost
in
his
own
thoughts
we
shot
nothing
lost
one
chance
after
another
through
thinking
of
other
things
than
sport
about
noon
glahn
began
walking
a
bit
ahead
of
me
as
if
to
give
me
a
better
chance
of
doing
what
i
liked
with
him
he
walked
right
across
the
muzzle
of
my
gun
but
i
bore
with
that
too
we
came
back
that
evening
nothing
had
happened
i
thought
to
myself
perhaps
he
be
more
careful
now
and
leave
maggie
this
has
been
the
longest
day
of
my
life
said
glahn
when
we
got
back
to
the
hut
nothing
more
was
said
on
either
side
the
next
few
days
he
was
in
the
blackest
humor
seemingly
all
about
the
same
letter
i
ca
stand
it
no
it
more
than
i
can
bear
he
would
say
sometimes
in
the
night
we
could
hear
it
all
through
the
hut
his
ill
temper
carried
him
so
far
that
he
would
not
even
answer
the
most
friendly
questions
when
our
landlady
spoke
to
him
and
he
used
to
groan
in
his
sleep
he
must
have
a
deal
on
his
conscience
i
thought
but
why
in
the
name
of
goodness
did
he
go
home
just
pride
no
doubt
he
would
not
go
back
when
he
had
been
turned
off
once
i
met
maggie
every
evening
and
glahn
talked
with
her
no
more
i
noticed
that
she
had
given
up
chewing
things
altogether
she
never
chewed
now
i
was
pleased
at
that
and
thought
she
given
up
chewing
things
that
is
one
failing
the
less
and
i
love
her
twice
as
much
as
i
did
before
one
day
she
asked
about
glahn
asked
very
cautiously
was
he
not
well
had
he
gone
away
if
he
not
dead
or
gone
away
i
said
he
lying
at
home
no
doubt
it
all
one
to
me
he
beyond
all
bearing
but
just
then
coming
up
to
the
hut
we
saw
glahn
lying
on
a
mat
on
the
ground
hands
at
the
back
of
his
neck
staring
up
at
the
sky
there
he
is
i
said
maggie
went
straight
up
to
him
before
i
could
stop
her
and
said
in
a
pleased
sort
of
voice
i
do
chew
things
now
nothing
at
all
no
feathers
or
money
or
bits
of
paper
you
can
see
for
glahn
scarcely
looked
at
her
he
lay
still
maggie
and
i
went
on
when
i
reproached
her
with
having
broken
her
promise
and
spoken
to
glahn
again
she
answered
that
she
had
only
meant
to
show
him
he
was
wrong
that
right
show
him
he
wrong
i
said
but
do
you
mean
it
was
for
his
sake
you
stopped
chewing
things
she
did
answer
what
would
she
answer
do
you
hear
tell
me
was
it
for
his
sake
and
i
could
not
think
otherwise
why
should
she
do
anything
for
sake
that
evening
maggie
promised
to
come
to
me
and
she
did
v
she
came
at
ten
i
heard
her
voice
outside
she
was
talking
loud
to
a
child
whom
she
led
by
the
hand
why
did
she
not
come
in
and
what
had
she
brought
the
child
for
i
watched
her
and
it
struck
me
that
she
was
giving
a
signal
by
talking
out
loud
to
the
child
i
noticed
too
that
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
attic
on
glahn
window
up
there
had
he
nodded
to
her
i
wondered
or
beckoned
to
her
from
inside
when
he
heard
her
talking
outside
anyhow
i
had
sense
enough
myself
to
know
there
was
no
need
to
look
up
aloft
when
talking
to
a
child
on
the
ground
i
was
going
out
to
take
her
by
the
arm
but
just
then
she
let
go
the
child
hand
left
the
child
standing
there
and
came
in
herself
through
the
door
to
the
hut
she
stepped
into
the
passage
well
there
she
was
at
last
i
would
take
care
to
give
her
a
good
talking
to
when
she
came
well
i
stood
there
and
heard
maggie
step
into
the
passage
there
was
no
mistake
she
was
close
outside
my
door
but
instead
of
coming
in
to
me
i
heard
her
step
up
the
ladder
up
to
the
attic
to
glahn
hole
up
there
i
heard
it
only
too
well
i
threw
my
door
open
wide
but
maggie
had
gone
up
already
that
was
ten
i
went
in
sat
down
in
my
room
and
took
my
gun
and
loaded
it
at
twelve
i
went
up
the
ladder
and
listened
at
glahn
door
i
could
hear
maggie
in
there
i
went
down
again
at
one
i
went
up
again
all
was
quiet
this
time
i
waited
outside
the
door
three
four
five
good
i
thought
to
myself
but
a
little
after
i
heard
a
noise
and
movement
below
in
the
hut
in
my
landlady
room
and
i
had
to
go
down
again
quickly
so
as
not
to
let
her
find
me
there
i
might
have
listened
much
more
but
i
had
to
go
in
the
passage
i
said
to
myself
see
here
she
went
she
must
have
touched
my
door
with
her
arm
as
she
passed
but
she
did
not
open
the
door
she
went
up
the
ladder
and
here
is
the
ladder
itself
those
four
steps
she
has
trodden
my
bed
still
lay
untouched
and
i
did
not
lie
down
now
but
sat
by
the
window
fingering
my
rifle
now
and
again
my
heart
was
not
beating
it
was
trembling
half
an
hour
later
i
heard
maggie
footstep
on
the
ladder
again
i
lay
close
up
to
the
window
and
saw
her
walk
out
of
the
hut
she
was
wearing
her
little
short
cotton
petticoat
that
did
not
even
reach
to
her
knees
and
over
her
shoulders
a
woolen
scarf
borrowed
from
glahn
she
walked
slowly
as
she
always
did
and
did
not
so
much
as
glance
towards
my
window
then
she
disappeared
behind
the
huts
a
little
after
came
glahn
with
his
rifle
under
his
arm
all
ready
to
go
out
he
looked
gloomy
and
did
not
even
say
i
noticed
though
that
he
had
got
himself
up
and
taken
special
care
about
his
dress
i
got
ready
at
once
and
went
with
him
neither
of
us
said
a
word
the
first
two
birds
we
shot
were
mangled
horribly
through
shooting
them
with
the
rifle
but
we
cooked
them
under
a
tree
as
best
we
could
and
ate
in
silence
so
the
day
wore
on
till
noon
glahn
called
out
to
me
sure
your
gun
is
loaded
we
might
come
across
something
unexpectedly
load
it
it
is
loaded
i
answered
then
he
disappeared
a
moment
into
the
bush
i
felt
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
shoot
him
then
pick
him
off
and
shoot
him
down
like
a
dog
there
was
no
hurry
he
could
still
enjoy
the
thought
of
it
for
a
bit
he
knew
well
enough
what
i
had
in
mind
that
was
why
he
had
asked
if
my
gun
were
loaded
even
he
could
not
refrain
from
giving
way
to
his
beastly
pride
he
had
dressed
himself
up
and
put
on
a
new
shirt
his
manner
was
lordly
beyond
all
bounds
about
one
he
stopped
pale
and
angry
in
front
of
me
and
said
i
ca
stand
this
look
and
see
if
you
loaded
man
if
anything
in
your
kindly
look
after
your
own
gun
i
answered
but
i
knew
well
enough
why
he
kept
asking
about
mine
and
he
turned
away
again
my
answer
had
so
effectively
put
him
in
his
place
that
he
actually
seemed
cowed
he
even
hung
his
head
as
he
walked
off
after
a
while
i
shot
a
pigeon
and
loaded
again
while
i
was
doing
so
i
caught
sight
of
glahn
standing
half
hidden
behind
a
tree
watching
me
to
see
if
i
really
loaded
a
little
later
he
started
singing
a
hymn
and
a
wedding
hymn
into
the
bargain
singing
wedding
hymns
and
putting
on
his
best
clothes
i
thought
to
myself
that
his
way
of
being
extra
fascinating
even
before
he
had
finished
the
hymn
he
began
walking
softly
in
front
of
me
hanging
his
head
and
still
singing
as
he
walked
he
was
keeping
right
in
front
of
the
muzzle
of
my
gun
again
as
if
thinking
to
himself
now
it
is
coming
and
that
is
why
i
am
singing
this
wedding
hymn
but
it
did
not
come
yet
and
when
he
had
finished
his
singing
he
had
to
look
back
at
me
we
sha
get
much
anyhow
by
the
look
of
it
he
said
with
a
smile
as
if
excusing
himself
and
asking
pardon
of
me
for
singing
while
we
were
out
after
game
but
even
at
that
moment
his
smile
was
beautiful
it
was
as
if
he
were
weeping
inwardly
and
his
lips
trembled
too
for
all
that
he
boasted
of
being
able
to
smile
at
such
a
solemn
moment
i
was
no
woman
and
he
saw
well
enough
that
he
made
no
impression
on
me
he
grew
impatient
his
face
paled
he
circled
round
me
with
hasty
steps
showing
up
now
to
the
left
now
to
the
right
of
me
and
stopping
every
now
and
then
to
wait
for
me
to
come
up
about
five
i
heard
a
shot
all
of
a
sudden
and
a
bullet
sang
past
my
left
ear
i
looked
up
there
was
glahn
standing
motionless
a
few
paces
off
staring
at
me
his
smoking
rifle
lay
along
his
arm
had
he
tried
to
shoot
me
i
said
you
missed
that
time
you
been
shooting
badly
of
but
he
had
not
been
shooting
badly
he
never
missed
he
had
only
been
trying
to
irritate
me
then
take
your
revenge
damn
you
he
shouted
back
all
in
good
time
i
said
clenching
my
teeth
we
stood
there
looking
at
each
other
and
suddenly
glahn
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
called
out
coward
to
me
and
why
should
he
call
me
a
coward
i
threw
my
rifle
to
my
shoulder
aimed
full
in
his
face
fired
as
a
man
soweth
now
there
is
no
need
i
insist
for
the
glahns
to
make
further
inquiry
about
this
man
it
annoys
me
to
be
constantly
seeing
their
advertisements
offering
such
and
such
reward
for
information
about
a
dead
man
thomas
glahn
was
killed
by
accident
shot
by
accident
when
out
on
a
hunting
trip
in
india
the
court
entered
his
name
with
the
particulars
of
his
end
in
a
register
with
pierced
and
threaded
leaves
and
in
that
register
it
says
that
he
is
dead
i
tell
you
and
what
is
more
that
he
was
killed
by
accident
the
end
