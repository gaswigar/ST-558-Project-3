of

was
published
by
john
bunyan
in
two
years
after
the
first
edition
of
the
first
part
of
pilgrim
s
in
the
opening
sentence
of
his
preface
he
tells
us
it
was
intended
by
him
as
the
counterpart
or
companion
picture
to
the
allegory
but
whatever
his
own
intentions
may
have
been
the
public
of
his
own
time
seem
to
have
declined
to
accept
the
book
in
this
capacity
indeed
another
writer
who
signs
himself
undertook
to
complete
bunyan
s
allegory
for
him
in
a
book
in
size
and
type
closely
resembling
it
and
entitled
second
part
of
the
pilgrim
s
progress
exactly
described
under
the
similitude
of
a
it
was
printed
for
jho
malthus
at
the

in
the
poultry
and
published
in
so
far
as
is
known
only
one
copy
of
this
book
is
now
in
existence
the
copy
which
was
formerly
in
the
library
of
the
poet
southey
and
now
in
that
of
the
baptist
union
upon
this
bunyan
seems
to
have
changed
his
purpose
so
far
as
life
and
death
of
mr
was
concerned
and
on
the
first
of
january
published
the
story
of
christiana
and
her
children
as
his
own
second
part
of
pilgrim
s
the
work
before
us
therefore
now
stands
apart
by
itself
in
its
composition
bunyan
seems
to
have
been
greatly
influenced
so
far
as
form
is
concerned
by
a
book
which
his
wife
brought
with
her
on
her
marriage
and
which
as
he
tells
us
in
his
they
read
together
it
was
entitled

in

the
eleventh
impression
the
earliest
now
known
is
dated
both
books
are
in
dialogue
form
and
in
each
case
the
dialogue
is
supposed
to
be
carried
on
through
one
long
day
bunyan
s
like
dent
s
holds
forth
instructive
discourse
while
the
of
the
former
like
the
of
the
latter
listens
and
draws
on
his
teacher
by
friendly
questionings
there
is
not
in
bunyan
s
conference
as
there
is
in
dent
s
an
who
plays
the
part
of
an
ignorant
man
to
come
out
enlightened
and
convinced
at
last
or
an
who
carps
and
cavils
all
the
way
and
there
is
not
in
dent
s
book
what
there
is
in
bunyan
s
a
biographical
narrative
connecting
the
various
parts
of
the
dialogue
but
the
groundwork
of
each
is
the
searching
manifestation
and
exposure
of
the
nature
and
evils
of
various
forms
of
immorality
bunyan

came
out
in
and
was
published
by

was
also
the
publisher

read

neither

the
text
of
this
edition
of
bunyan

is
a
careful
reproduction
of
the
first
edition
of
it
is
not
certain
that
there
was
any
further
authentic
reprint
in

though
both
in
the
bodleian
and
the
british
museum
there
is
a
copy
purporting
to
be
a
second
edition
and
bearing
date
it
is
difficult
to
resist
the
impression
that
they
are
pirated
copies
similar
to
those
of
which
nathaniel
ponder
complained
so
bitterly
in
the
case
of
pilgrim
s
for
both
paper
and
typography
are
greatly
inferior
to
those
of
the
first

most
characteristic
marginalia
are
carelessly
omitted

the
author
to
the
reader
courteous
reader
as
i
was
considering
with
my
self
what
i
had
written
concerning
the
progress
of
the
pilgrim
from
this
world
to
glory
and
how
it
had
been
acceptable
to
many
in
this
nation
it
came
again
into
my
mind
to
write
as
then
of
him
that
was
going
to
heaven
so
now
of
the
life
and
death
of
the
ungodly
and
of
their
travel
from
this
world
to
hell
the
which
in
this
i
have
done
and
have
put
it
as
thou
seest
under
the
name
and
title
of
badman
a
name
very
proper
for
such
a
subject
i
have
also
put
it
into
the
form
of
a
dialogue
that
i
might
with
more
ease
to
my
self
and
pleasure
to
the
reader
perform
the
work
and
although
as
i
said
i
have
put
it
forth
in
this
method
yet
have
i
as
little
as
may
be
gone
out
of
the
road
of
mine
own
observation
of
things
yea
i
think
i
may
truly
say
that
to
the
best
of
my
remembrance
all
the
things
that
here
i
discourse
of
i
mean
as
to
matter
of
fact
have
been
acted
upon
the
stage
of
this
world
even
many
times
before
mine
eyes
here
therefore
courteous
reader
i
present
thee
with
the
life
and
death
of
badman
indeed
yea
i
do
trace
him
in
his
life
from
his
childhood
to
his
death
that
thou
mayest
as
in
a
glass
behold
with
thine
own
eyes
the
steps
that
take
hold
of
hell
and
also
discern
while
thou
art
reading
of
badmans
death
whether
thou
thy
self
art
treading
in
his
path
thereto
and
let
me
entreat
thee
to
forbear
quirking
and
mocking
for
that
i
say
badman
is
dead
but
rather
gravely
enquire
concerning
thy
self
by
the
word
whether
thou
art
one
of
his
linage
or
no
for
badman
has
left
many
of
his
relations
behind
him
yea
the
very
world
is
overspread
with
his
kindred
true
some
of
his
relations
as
he
are
gone
to
their
place
and
long
home
but
thousands
of
thousands
are
left
behind
as
brothers
sisters
cousens
nephews
besides
innumerable
of
his
friends
and
associates
i
may
say
and
yet
speak
nothing
but
too
much
truth
in
so
saying
that
there
is
scarce
a
fellowship
a
community
or
fraternity
of
men
in
the
world
but
some
of
badmans
relations
are
there
yea
rarely
can
we
find
a
family
or
houshold
in
a
town
where
he
has
not
left
behind
him
either
brother
nephew
or
friend
the
butt
therefore
that
at
this
time
i
shoot
at
is
wide
and
twill
be
as
impossible
for
this
book
to
go
into
several
families
and
not
to
arrest
some
as
for
the
kings
messenger
to
rush
into
an
house
full
of
traitors
and
find
none
but
honest
men
there
i
can
not
but
think
that
this
shot
will
light
upon
many
since
our
fields
are
so
full
of
this
game
but
how
many
it
will
kill
to
badmans
course
and
make
alive
to
the
pilgrims
progress
that
is
not
in
me
to
determine
this
secret
is
with
the
lord
our
god
only
and
he
alone
knows
to
whom
he
will
bless
it
to
so
good
and
so
blessed
an
end
however
i
have
put
fire
to
the
pan
and
doubt
not
but
the
report
will
quickly
be
heard
i
told
you
before
that
badman
had
left
many
of
his
friends
and
relations
behind
him
but
if
i
survive
them
as
that
s
a
great
question
to
me
i
may
also
write
of
their
lives
however
whether
my
life
be
longer
or
shorter
this
is
my
prayer
at
present
that
god
will
stir
up
witnesses
against
them
that
may
either
convert
or
confound
them
for
wherever
they
live
and
roll
in
their
wickedness
they
are
the
pest
and
plague
of
that
countrey
england
shakes
and
totters
already
by
reason
of
the
burden
that
badman
and
his
friends
have
wickedly
laid
upon
it
yea
our
earth
reels
and
staggereth
to
and
fro
like
a
drunkard
the
transgression
thereof
is
heavy
upon
it
courteous
reader
i
will
treat
thee
now
even
at
the
door
and
threshold
of
this
house
but
only
with
this
intelligence
that
badman
lies
dead
within
be
pleased
therefore
if
thy
leisure
will
serve
thee
to
enter
in
and
behold
the
state
in
which
he
is
laid
betwixt
his
and
the
grave
he
is
not
buried
as
yet
nor
doth
he
stink
as
is
designed
he
shall
before
he
lies
down
in
oblivion
now
as
others
have
had
their
funerals
solemnized
according
to
their
greatness
and
grandure
in
the
world
so
likewise
badman
forasmuch
as
he
deserveth
not
to
go
down
to
his
grave
with
silence
has
his
funeral
state
according
to
his
deserts
four
things
are
usual
at
great
mens
funerals
which
we
will
take
leave
and
i
hope
without
offence
to
allude
to
in
the
funeral
of
badman
first
they
are
sometimes
when
dead
presented
to
their
friends
by
their
compleatly
wrought
images
as
lively
as
by
cunning
mens
hands
they
can
be
that
the
remembrance
of
them
may
be
renewed
to
their
survivors
the
remembrance
of
them
and
their
deeds
and
this
i
have
endeavoured
to
answer
in
my
discourse
of
badman
and
therefore
i
have
drawn
him
forth
in
his
featours
and
actions
from
his
childhood
to
his
gray
hairs
here
therefore
thou
hast
him
lively
set
forth
as
in
cutts
both
as
to
the
minority
flower
and
seniority
of
his
age
together
with
those
actions
of
his
life
that
he
was
most
capable
of
doing
in
and
under
those
present
circumstances
of
time
place
strength
and
the
opportunities
that
did
attend
him
in
these
secondly
there
is
also
usual
at
great
mens
funerals
those
badges
and
scutcheons
of
their
honour
that
they
have
received
from
their
ancestors
or
have
been
thought
worthy
of
for
the
deeds
and
exploits
they
have
done
in
their
life
and
here
badman
has
his
but
such
as
vary
from
all
men
of
worth
but
so
much
the
more
agreeing
with
the
merit
of
his
doings
they
all
have
descended
in
state
he
only
as
an
abominable
branch
his
deserts
are
the
deserts
of
sin
and
therefore
the
scutcheons
of
honour
that
he
has
are
only
that
he
died
without
honour
and
at
his
end
became
a
fool
thou
shalt
not
be
joyned
with
them
in
seed
of
evil
doers
shall
never
be
renowned
the
funeral
pomp
therefore
of
badman
is
to
wear
upon
his
hearse
the
badges
of
a
dishonourable
and
wicked
life
since
his
bones
are
full
of
the
sins
of
his
youth
which
shall
lye
down
as
job
sayes
in
the
dust
with
him
nor
is
it
fit
that
any
should
be
his
attendants
now
at
his
death
but
such
as
with
him
conspired
against
their
own
souls
in
their
life
persons
whose
transgressions
have
made
them
infamous
to
all
that
have
or
shall
know
what
they
have
done
some
notice
therefore
i
have
also
here
in
this
little
discourse
given
the
reader
of
them
who
were
his
confederates
in
his
life
and
attendants
at
his
death
with
a
hint
either
of
some
high
villany
committed
by
them
as
also
of
those
judgments
that
have
overtaken
and
fallen
upon
them
from
the
just
and
revenging
hand
of
god
all
which
are
things
either
fully
known
by
me
as
being
eye
and
thereto
or
that
i
have
received
from
such
hands
whose
relation
as
to
this
i
am
bound
to
believe
and
that
the
reader
may
know
them
from
other
things
and
passages
herein
contained
i
have
pointed
at
them
in
the
margent
as
with
a
finger
thus
picture
graphic
of
hand
with
finger
printing
right
thirdly
the
funerals
of
persons
of
quality
have
been
solemnized
with
some
suitable
sermon
at
the
time
and
place
of
their
burial
but
that
i
am
not
come
to
as
yet
having
got
no
further
than
to
badmans
death
but
for
as
much
as
he
must
be
buried
after
he
hath
stunk
out
his
time
before
his
beholders
i
doubt
not
but
some
such
that
we
read
are
appointed
to
be
at
the
burial
of
gog
will
do
this
work
in
my
stead
such
as
shall
leave
him
neither
skin
nor
bone
above
ground
but
shall
set
a
sign
by
it
till
the
buriers
have
buried
it
in
the
valley
of
ezek
fourthly
at
funerals
there
does
use
to
be
mourning
and
lamentation
but
here
also
badman
differs
from
others
his
familiars
can
not
lament
his
departure
for
they
have
not
sence
of
his
damnable
state
they
rather
ring
him
and
sing
him
to
hell
in
the
sleep
of
death
in
which
he
goes
thither
good
men
count
him
no
loss
to
the
world
his
place
can
well
be
without
him
his
loss
is
only
his
own
and
tis
too
late
for
him
to
recover
that
dammage
or
loss
by
a
sea
of
bloody
tears
could
he
shed
them
yea
god
has
said
he
will
laugh
at
his
destruction
who
then
shall
lament
for
him
saying
ah
my
brother
he
was
but
a
stinking
weed
in
his
life
nor
was
he
better
at
all
in
his
death
such
may
well
be
thrown
over
the
wall
without
sorrow
when
once
god
has
plucked
them
up
by
the
roots
in
his
wrath
reader
if
thou
art
of
the
race
linage
stock
or
fraternity
of
badman
i
tell
thee
before
thou
readest
this
book
thou
wilt
neither
brook
the
author
nor
it
because
he
hath
writ
of
badman
as
he
has
for
he
that
condemneth
the
wicked
that
die
so
passeth
also
the
sentence
upon
the
wicked
that
live
i
therefore
expect
neither
credit
of
nor
countenance
from
thee
for
this
narration
of
thy
kinsmans
life
for
thy
old
love
to
thy
friend
his
wayes
doings
will
stir
up
in
thee
enmity
rather
in
thy
very
heart
against
me
i
shall
therefore
incline
to
think
of
thee
that
thou
wilt
rent
burn
or
throw
it
away
in
contempt
yea
and
wish
also
that
for
writing
so
notorious
a
truth
some
mischief
may
befall
me
i
look
also
to
be
loaded
by
thee
with
disdain
scorn
and
contempt
yea
that
thou
shouldest
railingly
and
vilifyingly
say
i
lye
and
am
a
bespatterer
of
honest
mens
lives
and
deaths
for
badman
when
himself
was
alive
could
not
abide
to
be
counted
a
knave
though
his
actions
told
all
that
went
by
that
indeed
he
was
such
an
one
how
then
should
his
brethren
that
survive
him
and
that
tread
in
his
very
steps
approve
of
the
sentence
that
by
this
book
is
pronounced
against
him
will
they
not
rather
imitate
corah
dathan
and
abiram
s
friends
even
rail
at
me
for
condemning
him
as
they
did
at
moses
for
doing
execution
i
know
tis
ill
pudling
in
the
cockatrices
den
and
that
they
run
hazards
that
hunt
the
the
man
also
that
writeth
badmans
life
had
need
to
be
fenced
with
a
coat
of
mail
and
with
the
staffe
of
a
spear
for
that
his
surviving
friends
will
know
what
he
doth
but
i
have
adventured
to
do
it
and
to
play
at
this
time
at
the
hole
of
these
asps
if
they
bite
they
bite
if
they
sting
they
sting
christ
sends
his
lambs
in
the
midst
of
wolves
not
to
do
like
them
but
to
suffer
by
them
for
bearing
plain
testimony
against
their
bad
deeds
but
had
one
not
need
to
walk
with
a
guard
and
to
have
a
sentinel
stand
at
ones
door
for
this
verily
the
flesh
would
be
glad
of
such
help
yea
a
spiritual
man
could
he
tell
how
to
get
it
acts
but
i
am
stript
naked
of
these
and
yet
am
commanded
to
be
faithful
in
my
servi
c
e
for
christ
well
then
i
have
spoken
what
i
have
spoken
and
now
come
on
me
what
will
job
true
the
text
sayes
rebuke
a
scorner
and
he
will
hate
thee
and
that
he
that
reproveth
a
wicked
man
getteth
himself
a
blot
and
shame
but
what
then
open
rebuke
is
better
than
secret
love
and
he
that
receives
it
shall
find
it
so
afterwards
so
then
whether
badmans
friends
shall
rage
or
laugh
at
what
i
have
writ
i
know
that
the
better
end
of
the
staffe
is
mine
my
endeavour
is
to
stop
an
hellish
course
of
life
and
to
save
a
soul
from
death
jam
and
if
for
so
doing
i
meet
with
envy
from
them
from
whom
in
reason
i
should
have
thanks
i
must
remember
the
man
in
the
dream
that
cut
his
way
through
his
armed
enemies
and
so
got
into
the
beauteous
palace
i
must
i
say
remember
him
and
do
my
self
likewise
yet
four
things
i
will
propound
to
the
consideration
of
badmans
friends
before
i
turn
my
back
upon
them
suppose
that
there
be
an
hell
in
very
deed
not
that
i
do
question
it
any
more
than
i
do
whether
there
be
a
sun
to
shine
but
i
suppose
it
for
argument
sake
with
badmans
friends
i
say
suppose
there
be
an
hell
and
that
too
such
an
one
as
the
scripture
speaks
of
one
at
the
remotest
distance
from
god
and
life
eternall
one
where
the
worm
of
a
guilty
conscience
never
dyes
and
where
the
fire
of
the
wrath
of
god
is
not
quenched
suppose
i
say
that
there
is
such
an
hell
prepared
of
god
as
there
is
indeed
for
the
body
and
soul
of
the
ungodly
world
after
this
life
to
be
tormented
in
i
say
do
but
with
thy
self
suppose
it
and
then
tell
me
is
it
not
prepared
for
thee
thou
being
a
wicked
man
let
thy
conscience
speak
i
say
is
it
not
prepared
for
thee
thou
being
an
ungodly
man
and
dost
thou
think
wast
thou
there
now
that
thou
art
able
to
wrestle
with
the
judgment
of
god
why
then
do
the
fallen
angers
tremble
there
thy
hands
can
not
be
strong
nor
can
thy
heart
endure
in
that
day
when
god
shall
deal
with
thee
ezek
suppose
that
some
one
that
is
now
a
soul
in
hell
for
sin
was
permitted
to
come
hither
again
to
dwell
and
that
they
had
a
grant
also
that
upon
amendment
of
life
next
time
the
dye
to
change
that
place
for
heaven
ant
glory
what
sayest
thou
o
wicked
man
would
such
an
one
thinkest
thou
run
again
into
the
same
course
of
life
as
before
and
venture
the
damnation
that
for
sin
he
had
already
been
in
would
he
choose
again
to
lead
that
cursed
life
that
afresh
would
kindle
the
flames
of
hell
upon
him
and
that
would
bind
him
up
under
the
heavy
wrath
of
god
o
he
would
not
he
would
not
the
sixteenth
of
luke
insinuates
it
yea
reason
it
self
awake
would
abhorr
it
and
tremble
at
such
a
thought
suppose
again
that
thou
that
livest
and
rollest
in
thy
sin
and
that
as
yet
hast
known
nothing
but
the
pleasure
thereof
shouldst
be
by
an
angel
conveyed
to
some
place
where
with
convenience
from
thence
thou
mightest
have
a
view
of
heaven
and
hell
of
the
joyes
of
the
one
and
the
torments
of
the
other
i
say
suppose
that
from
thence
thou
mightest
have
such
a
view
thereof
as
would
convince
thy
reason
that
both
heaven
and
hell
are
such
realities
as
by
the
word
they
are
declared
to
be
wouldest
thou
thinkest
thou
when
brought
to
thy
home
again
chuse
to
thy
self
thy
former
life
to
wit
to
return
to
thy
folly
again
no
if
belief
of
what
thou
sawest
remained
with
thee
thou
wouldest
eat
fire
and
brimstone
first
i
will
propound
again
suppose
that
there
was
amongst
us
such
a
law
and
such
a
magistrate
to
inflict
the
penalty
that
for
every
open
wickedness
committed
by
thee
so
much
of
thy
flesh
should
with
burning
pincers
be
plucked
from
thy
bones
wouldest
thou
then
go
on
in
thy
open
way
of
lying
swearing
drinking
and
whoring
as
thou
with
delight
doest
now
surely
surely
no
the
fear
of
the
punishment
would
make
thee
forbear
yea
would
make
thee
tremble
even
then
when
thy
lusts
were
powerfull
to
think
what
a
punishment
thou
wast
sure
to
sustain
so
soon
as
the
pleasure
was
over
but
oh
the
folly
the
madness
the
desperate
madness
that
is
in
the
hearts
of
badmans
friends
who
in
despite
of
the
threatnings
of
an
holy
and
sin
revenging
god
and
of
the
outcries
and
warnings
of
all
good
men
yea
that
will
in
despite
of
the
groans
and
torments
of
those
that
are
now
in
hell
for
sin
luk
go
on
in
a
sinfull
course
of
life
yea
though
every
sin
is
also
a
step
of
descent
down
to
that
infernal
cave
o
how
true
is
that
saying
of
solomon
the
heart
of
the
sons
of
men
is
full
of
evil
and
madness
is
in
their
heart
while
they
live
and
after
that
they
go
to
the
dead
eccles
to
the
dead
that
is
to
the
dead
in
hell
to
the
damned
dead
the
place
to
which
those
that
have
dyed
bad
men
are
gone
and
that
those
that
live
bad
men
are
like
to
go
to
when
a
little
more
sin
like
stollen
waters
hath
been
imbibed
by
their
sinful
souls
that
which
has
made
me
publish
this
book
is
for
that
wickedness
like
a
flood
is
like
to
drown
our
english
world
it
begins
already
to
be
above
the
tops
of
mountains
it
has
almost
swallowed
up
all
our
youth
our
middle
age
old
age
and
all
are
almost
carried
away
of
this
flood
o
debauchery
debauchery
what
hast
thou
done
in
england
thou
hast
corrupted
our
young
men
and
hast
made
our
old
men
beasts
thou
hast
deflowered
our
virgins
and
hast
made
matrons
bawds
thou
hast
made
our
earth
to
reel
to
and
fro
like
a
drunkard
tis
in
danger
to
be
removed
like
a
cottage
yea
it
is
because
transgression
is
so
heavy
upon
it
like
to
fall
and
rise
no
more
isa
o
that
i
could
mourn
for
england
and
for
the
sins
that
are
committed
therein
even
while
i
see
that
without
repentance
the
men
of
gods
wrath
are
about
to
deal
with
us
each
having
his
slaughtering
weapon
in
his
hand
ezek
well
i
have
written
and
by
gods
assistance
shall
pray
that
this
flood
may
abate
in
england
and
could
i
but
see
the
tops
of
the
mountains
above
it
i
should
think
that
these
waters
were
abating
it
is
the
duty
of
those
that
can
to
cry
out
against
this
deadly
plague
yea
to
lift
up
their
voice
as
with
a
trumpet
against
it
that
men
may
he
awakened
about
it
flye
from
it
as
from
that
which
is
the
greatest
of
evils
sin
pull
d
angels
out
of
heaven
pulls
men
down
to
hell
and
overthroweth
kingdoms
who
that
sees
an
house
on
fire
will
not
give
the
allarum
to
them
that
dwell
therein
who
that
sees
the
land
invaded
will
not
set
the
beacons
on
a
fame
who
that
sees
the
devils
as
roaring
lyons
continually
devouring
souls
will
not
make
an
but
above
all
when
we
see
sin
sinful
sin
a
swallowing
up
a
nation
sinking
of
a
nation
and
bringing
its
inhabitants
to
temporal
spiritual
and
eternal
ruine
shall
we
not
cry
out
and
cry
they
are
drunk
but
not
with
wine
they
stagger
but
not
with
strong
drink
they
are
intoxicated
with
the
deadly
poyson
of
sin
which
will
if
its
malignity
be
not
by
wholsom
means
allayed
bring
soul
and
body
and
estate
and
countrey
and
all
to
ruin
and
destruction
in
and
by
this
my
i
shall
deliver
my
self
from
the
ruins
of
them
that
perish
for
a
man
can
do
no
more
in
this
matter
i
mean
a
man
in
my
capacity
than
to
detect
and
condemn
the
wickedness
warn
the
evil
doer
of
the
judgment
and
fly
therefrom
my
self
but
oh
that
i
might
not
only
deliver
my
self
oh
that
many
would
hear
and
turn
at
this
my
cry
from
sin
that
they
may
be
secured
from
the
death
and
judgment
that
attend
it
why
i
have
handled
the
matter
in
this
method
is
best
known
to
my
self
and
why
i
have
concealed
most
of
the
names
of
the
persons
whose
sins
or
punishments
i
here
and
there
in
this
book
make
relation
of
is
for
that
neither
the
sins
nor
judgments
were
all
alike
open
the
sins
of
some
were
committed
and
the
judgments
executed
for
them
only
in
a
corner
not
to
say
that
i
could
not
learn
some
of
their
names
for
could
i
i
should
not
have
made
them
publick
for
this
reason
because
i
would
not
provoke
those
of
their
relations
that
survive
them
i
would
not
justly
provoke
them
and
yet
as
i
think
i
should
should
i
have
intailed
their
punishment
to
their
sins
and
both
to
their
names
and
so
have
turned
them
into
the
world
nor
would
i
lay
them
under
disgrace
and
contempt
which
would
as
i
think
unavoidably
have
happened
unto
them
had
i
withall
inserted
their
names
as
for
those
whose
names
i
mention
their
crimes
or
judgments
were
manifest
publick
almost
as
any
thing
of
that
nature
that
happeneth
to
mortal
men
such
therefore
have
published
their
own
shame
by
their
sin
and
god
his
anger
by
taking
of
open
vengeance
as
job
sayes
god
has
strook
them
as
wicked
men
in
the
open
sight
of
others
job
so
that
i
can
not
conceive
since
their
sin
and
judgment
was
so
conspicuous
that
my
admonishing
the
world
thereof
should
turn
to
their
detriment
for
the
publishing
of
these
things
are
so
far
as
relation
is
concerned
intended
for
remembrancers
that
they
may
also
bethink
themselves
repent
and
turn
to
god
lest
the
judgments
for
their
sins
should
prove
hereditary
for
the
god
of
heaven
hath
threatned
to
visit
the
iniquity
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
if
they
hate
him
to
the
third
and
fourth
generation
exod
nebuchadnezzars
punishment
for
his
pride
being
open
for
he
was
for
his
sin
driven
from
his
kingly
dignity
and
from
among
men
too
to
eat
grass
like
an
ox
and
to
company
with
the
beasts
daniel
did
not
stick
to
tell
belshazzar
his
son
to
his
face
thereof
nor
to
publish
it
that
it
might
be
read
and
remembred
by
the
generations
to
come
the
same
may
be
said
of
judas
and
ananias
for
their
sin
and
punishment
were
known
to
all
the
dwellers
at
jerusalem
acts
chap
nor
is
it
a
sign
but
of
desperate
impenitence
and
hardness
of
heart
when
the
offspring
or
relations
of
those
who
have
fallen
by
open
fearfull
and
prodigious
judgments
for
their
sin
shall
overlook
forget
pass
by
or
take
no
notice
of
such
high
outgoings
of
god
against
them
and
their
house
thus
daniel
aggravates
belshazzars
crime
for
that
he
hardened
his
heart
in
pride
though
he
knew
that
for
that
very
sin
and
transgression
his
father
was
brought
down
from
his
height
and
made
to
be
a
companion
for
asses
and
thou
his
son
o
belshazzar
sayes
he
hast
not
humbled
thy
heart
though
thou
knewest
all
this
dan
a
home
reproof
indeed
but
home
is
most
fit
for
an
open
and
transgression
let
those
then
that
are
the
offspring
or
relations
of
such
who
by
their
own
sin
and
the
dreadfull
judgments
of
god
are
made
to
become
a
sign
deut
having
been
swept
as
dung
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
beware
lest
when
judgment
knocks
at
their
door
for
their
sins
as
it
did
before
at
the
door
of
their
pregenitors
it
falls
also
with
as
heavy
a
stroak
as
on
them
that
went
before
them
lest
i
say
they
in
that
day
instead
of
finding
mercy
find
for
their
high
daring
and
judgment
without
mercy
to
conclude
let
those
that
would
not
dye
badmans
death
take
heed
of
badmans
wayes
for
his
wayes
bring
to
his
end
wickedness
will
not
deliver
him
that
is
given
to
it
though
they
should
cloak
all
with
a
profession
of
religion
if
it
was
a
transgression
of
old
for
a
man
to
wear
a
womans
apparel
surely
it
is
a
transgression
now
for
a
sinner
to
wear
a
christian
profession
for
a
cloak
wolves
in
sheeps
cloathing
swarm
in
england
this
day
wolves
both
as
to
doctrine
and
as
to
practice
too
some
men
make
a
profession
i
doubt
on
purpose
that
they
may
twist
themselves
into
a
trade
and
thence
into
an
estate
yea
and
if
need
be
into
an
estate
knavishly
by
the
ruins
of
their
neighbour
let
such
take
heed
for
those
that
do
such
things
have
the
greater
damnation
christian
make
thy
profession
shine
by
a
conversation
according
to
the
gospel
or
else
thou
wilt
damnifie
religion
bring
scandal
to
thy
brethren
and
give
offence
to
the
enemies
and
twould
be
better
that
a
millstone
was
hanged
about
thy
neck
and
that
thou
as
so
adorned
wast
cast
into
the
bottom
of
the
sea
than
so
to
do
christian
a
profession
according
to
the
gospel
is
in
these
dayes
a
rare
thing
seek
then
after
it
put
it
on
and
keep
it
without
spot
and
as
becomes
thee
white
and
clean
and
thou
shalt
be
a
rare
christian
the
prophecy
of
the
last
times
is
that
professing
men
for
so
i
understand
the
text
s
h
all
be
many
of
them
base
tim
but
continue
thou
in
the
things
that
thou
hast
learned
not
of
wanton
men
not
of
licentious
times
but
of
the
word
and
doctrine
of
god
that
is
according
to
godliness
and
thou
shalt
walk
with
christ
in
white
now
god
almighty
give
his
people
grace
not
to
hate
or
malign
sinners
nor
yet
to
choose
any
of
their
wayes
but
to
keep
themselves
pure
from
the
blood
of
all
men
by
speaking
and
doing
according
to
that
name
and
those
rules
that
they
profess
to
know
and
love
for
jesus
christs
sake

in

dialogue
betwixt
and
good
morrow
my
good
neighbour
attentive
whither
are
you
walking
so
early
this
morning
methinks
you
look
as
if
you
were
concerned
about
something
more
than
ordinary
have
you
lost
any
of
your
cattel
or
what
is
the
matter
attentive
good
sir
good
morrow
to
you
i
have
not
as
yet
lost
ought
but
yet
you
give
a
right
ghess
of
me
for
i
am
as
you
say
concerned
in
my
heart
but
tis
because
of
the
badness
of
the
times
and
sir
you
as
all
our
neighbours
know
are
a
very
observing
man
pray
therefore
what
do
you
think
of
them
wise
why
i
think
as
you
say
to
wit
that
they
are
bad
times
and
bad
they
will
be
untill
men
are
better
for
they
are
bad
men
that
make
bad
times
if
men
therefore
would
mend
so
would
the
times
tis
a
folly
to
look
for
good
dayes
so
long
as
sin
is
so
high
and
those
that
study
its
nourishment
so
many
god
bring
it
down
and
those
that
nourish
it
to
repentance
and
then
my
good
neighbour
you
will
be
concerned
not
as
you
are
now
now
you
are
concerned
because
times
are
so
bad
but
then
you
will
be
so
cause
times
are
so
good
now
you
are
concerned
so
as
to
be
perplexed
but
then
you
will
be
concerned
so
as
to
lift
up
your
voice
with
shouting
for
i
dare
say
could
you
see
such
dayes
they
would
make
you
shout
atten
ai
so
they
would
such
times
i
have
prayed
for
such
times
i
have
longed
for
but
i
fear
they
l
be
worse
before
they
be
better
wise
make
no
conclusions
man
for
he
that
hath
the
hearts
of
men
in
his
hand
can
change
them
from
worse
to
better
and
so
bad
times
into
good
god
give
long
life
to
them
that
are
good
and
especially
to
those
of
them
that
are
capable
of
doing
him
service
in
the
world
the
ornament
and
beauty
of
this
lower
world
next
to
god
and
his
wonders
are
the
men
that
spangle
and
shine
in
godliness
now
as
wiseman
said
this
he
gave
a
great
sigh
atten
amen
amen
but
why
good
sir
do
you
sigh
so
deeply
is
it
for
ought
else
than
that
for
the
which
as
you
have
perceived
i
my
self
am
concerned
wise
i
am
concerned
with
you
for
the
badness
of
the
times
but
that
was
not
the
cause
of
that
sigh
of
the
which
as
i
see
you
take
notice
i
sighed
at
the
remembrance
of
the
death
of
that
man
for
whom
the
bell
tolled
at
our
town
yesterday
atten
why
i
trow
goodman
your
neighbour
is
not
dead
indeed
i
did
hear
that
he
had
been
sick
wise
no
no
it
is
not
he
had
it
been
he
i
could
not
but
have
been
concerned
but
yet
not
as
i
am
concerned
now
if
he
had
died
i
should
only
have
been
concerned
for
that
the
world
had
lost
a
light
but
the
man
that
i
am
concerned
for
now
was
one
that
never
was
good
therefore
such
an
one
who
is
not
dead
only
but
damned
he
died
that
he
might
die
he
went
from
life
to
death
and
then
from
death
to
death
from
death
natural
to
death
eternal
and
as
he
spake
this
the
water
stood
in
his
eyes
atten
indeed
to
goe
from
a
to
hell
is
a
fearful
thing
to
think
on
but
good
neighbour
wiseman
be
pleased
to
tell
me
who
this
man
was
and
why
you
conclude
him
so
miserable
in
his
death
wise
well
if
you
can
stay
i
will
tell
you
who
he
was
and
why
i
conclude
thus
concerning
him
atten
my
leisure
will
admit
me
to
stay
and
i
am
willing
to
hear
you
out
and
i
pray
god
your
discourse
may
take
hold
on
my
heart
that
i
may
be
bettered
thereby
so
they
agreed
to
sit
down
under
a
tree
then
wiseman
proceeded
as
followeth
wise
the
man
that
i
mean
is
one
badman
he
has
lived
in
our
town
a
great
while
and
now
as
i
said
he
is
dead
but
the
reason
of
my
being
so
concerned
at
his
death
is
not
for
that
he
was
at
all
related
to
me
or
for
that
any
good
conditions
died
with
him
for
he
was
far
from
them
but
for
that
as
i
greatly
fear
he
hath
as
was
hinted
before
died
two
deaths
at
once
atten
i
perceive
what
you
mean
by
two
deaths
at
once
and
to
speak
truth
tis
a
fearfull
thing
thus
to
have
ground
to
think
of
any
for
although
the
death
of
the
ungodly
and
sinners
is
laid
to
heart
but
of
few
yet
to
die
in
such
a
state
is
more
dreadful
and
fearful
than
any
man
can
imagine
indeed
if
a
man
had
no
soul
if
his
state
was
not
truely
immortal
the
matter
would
not
be
so
much
but
for
a
man
to
be
so
disposed
of
by
his
maker
as
to
be
appointed
a
sensible
being
for
ever
and
for
him
too
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
revenging
justice
that
will
be
always
to
the
utmost
extremity
that
his
sin
deserveth
punishing
of
him
in
the
dismal
dungeon
of
hell
this
must
needs
be
unutterably
sad
and
lamentable
wise
there
is
no
man
i
think
that
is
sensible
of
the
worth
of
one
soul
but
must
when
he
hears
of
the
death
of
unconverted
men
be
stricken
with
sorrow
and
grief
because
as
you
said
well
that
mans
state
is
such
that
he
has
a
sensible
being
for
ever
for
tis
sense
that
makes
punishment
heavy
but
yet
sense
is
not
all
that
the
damned
have
they
have
sense
and
reason
too
so
then
as
sense
receiveth
punishment
with
sorrow
because
it
feels
and
bleeds
under
the
same
so
by
reason
and
the
exercise
thereof
in
the
midst
of
torment
all
present
affliction
is
aggravated
and
that
three
manner
of
wayes
reason
will
consider
thus
with
himself
for
what
am
i
thus
tormented
and
will
easily
find
tis
for
nothing
but
that
base
and
filthy
thing
sin
and
now
will
vexation
be
mixed
with
punishment
and
that
will
greatly
heighten
the
affliction
reason
will
consider
thus
with
himself
how
long
must
this
be
my
state
and
will
soon
return
to
himself
this
answer
this
must
be
my
state
for
ever
and
ever
now
this
will
greatly
increase
the
torment
reason
will
consider
thus
with
himself
what
have
i
lost
more
than
present
ease
and
quiet
by
my
sins
that
i
have
committed
and
will
quickly
return
himself
this
answer
i
have
lost
communion
with
god
christ
saints
and
angels
and
a
share
in
heaven
and
eternal
life
and
this
also
must
needs
greaten
the
misery
of
poor
damned
souls
and
this
is
the
case
of
badman
atten
i
feel
my
heart
even
shake
at
the
thoughts
of
coming
into
such
a
state
hell
who
knows
that
is
yet
alive
what
the
torments
of
hell
are
this
word
hell
gives
a
very
dreadful
sound
wise
ai
so
it
does
in
the
ears
of
him
that
has
a
tender
conscience
but
if
as
you
say
and
that
truly
the
very
name
of
hell
is
so
dreadful
what
is
the
place
it
self
and
what
are
the
punishments
that
are
there
inflicted
and
that
without
the
least
intermission
upon
the
souls
of
damned
men
for
ever
and
ever
atten
well
but
passing
this
my
leisure
will
admit
me
to
stay
and
therefore
pray
tell
me
what
it
is
that
makes
you
think
that
badman
is
gone
to
hell
wise
i
will
tell
you
but
first
do
you
know
which
of
the
badmans
i
mean
atten
why
was
there
more
of
them
than
one
wise
o
yes
a
great
many
both
brothers
and
sisters
and
yet
all
of
them
the
children
of
a
godly
parent
the
more
a
great
deal
is
the
pity
atten
which
of
them
therefore
was
it
that
died
wise
the
eldest
old
in
years
and
old
in
sin
but
the
sinner
that
dies
an
hundred
years
old
shall
be
accursed
atten
well
but
what
makes
you
think
he
is
gone
to
hell
wise
his
wicked
life
and
fearful
death
specially
since
the
manner
of
his
death
was
so
corresponding
with
his
life
atten
pray
let
me
know
the
manner
of
his
death
if
your
self
did
perfectly
know
it
wise
i
was
there
when
he
died
but
i
desire
not
to
see
another
such
man
while
i
live
die
in
such
sort
as
he
did
atten
pray
therefore
let
me
hear
it
wise
you
say
you
have
leisure
and
can
stay
and
therefore
if
you
please
we
will
discourse
even
orderly
of
him
first
we
will
begin
with
his
life
and
then
proceed
to
his
death
because
a
relation
of
the
first
may
the
more
affect
you
when
you
shall
hear
of
the
second
atten
did
you
then
so
well
know
his
life
wise
i
knew
him
of
a
child
i
was
a
man
when
he
was
but
a
boy
and
i
made
special
observation
of
him
from
first
to
last
atten
pray
then
let
me
hear
from
you
an
account
of
his
life
but
be
as
brief
as
you
can
for
i
long
to
hear
of
the
manner
of
his
death
wise
i
will
endeavour
to
answer
your
desires
and
first
i
will
tell
you
that
from
a
child
he
was
very
bad
his
very
beginning
was
ominous
and
presaged
that
no
good
end
was
in
likelyhood
to
follow
thereupon
there
were
several
sins
that
he
was
given
to
when
but
a
little
one
that
manifested
him
to
be
notoriously
infected
with
or
i
ginal
corruption
for
i
dare
say
he
learned
none
of
them
of
his
father
or
mother
nor
was
he
admitted
to
go
much
abroad
among
other
children
that
were
vile
to
learn
to
sin
of
them
nay
contrariwise
if
at
any
time
he
did
get
abroad
amongst
others
he
would
be
as
the
inventer
of
bad
words
and
an
example
in
bad
actions
to
them
all
he
used
to
be
as
we
say
the
and
from
a
childe
atten
this
was
a
bad
beginning
indeed
and
did
demonstrate
that
he
was
as
you
say
polluted
very
much
polluted
with
original
corruption
for
to
speak
my
mind
freely
i
do
confess
that
it
is
mine
opinion
that
children
come
polluted
with
sin
into
the
world
and
that
the
sins
of
their
youth
especially
while
they
are
very
young
are
rather
by
vertue
of
indwelling
sin
than
by
examples
that
are
set
before
them
by
others
not
but
that
they
learn
to
sin
by
example
too
but
example
is
not
the
root
but
rather
the
temptation
unto
wickedness
the
root
is
sin
within
for
from
within
out
of
the
heart
of
man
proceedeth
sin
wise
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
you
are
of
this
opinion
and
to
confirm
what
you
have
said
by
a
few
hints
from
the
word
man
in
his
birth
is
compared
to
an
ass
an
unclean
beast
and
to
a
wretched
infant
in
its
blood
besides
all
the
of
old
that
were
offered
unto
the
lord
were
to
be
redeemed
at
the
age
of
a
month
and
that
was
before
they
were
sinners
by
imitation
the
scripture
also
affirmeth
that
by
the
sin
of
one
judgement
came
upon
all
and
renders
this
reason
for
that
all
have
sinned
nor
is
that
objection
worth
a
rush
that
christ
by
his
death
hath
taken
away
original
sin
first
because
it
is
scriptureless
secondly
because
it
makes
them
incapable
of
salvation
by
christ
for
none
but
those
that
in
their
own
persons
are
sinners
are
to
have
salvation
by
him
many
other
things
might
be
added
but
between
persons
so
well
agreed
as
you
and
i
are
these
may
suffice
at
present
but
when
an
antagonist
comes
to
deal
with
us
about
this
matter
then
we
have
for
him
often
other
strong
arguments
if
he
be
an
antagonist
worth
the
taking
notice
of
atten
but
as
was
hinted
before
he
used
to
be
the
sinner
or
the
master
of
mischief
among
other
children
yet
these
are
but
generals
pray
therefore
tell
me
in
particular
which
were
the
sins
of
his
childhood
wise
i
will
so
when
he
was
but
a
child
he
was
so
addicted
to
lying
that
his
parents
scarce
knew
when
to
believe
he
spake
true
yea
he
would
invent
tell
and
stand
to
the
lyes
that
he
invented
and
told
and
that
with
such
an
audacious
face
that
one
might
even
read
in
his
very
countenance
the
symptoms
of
an
hard
and
desperate
heart
this
way
atten
this
was
an
ill
beginning
indeed
and
argueth
that
he
began
to
harden
himself
in
sin
betimes
for
a
lye
can
not
be
knowingly
told
and
stood
in
and
i
perceive
that
this
was
his
manner
of
way
in
lying
but
he
must
as
it
were
force
his
own
heart
into
it
yea
he
must
make
his
heart
hard
and
bold
to
doe
it
yea
he
must
be
arrived
to
an
exceeding
pitch
of
wickedness
thus
to
doe
since
all
this
he
did
against
that
good
education
that
before
you
seemed
to
hint
he
had
from
his
father
and
mother
wise
the
want
of
good
education
as
you
have
intimated
is
many
times
a
cause
why
children
doe
so
easily
so
soon
become
bad
especially
when
there
is
not
only
a
want
of
that
but
bad
examples
enough
as
the
more
is
the
pity
there
is
in
many
families
by
vertue
of
which
poor
children
are
trained
up
in
sin
and
nursed
therein
for
the
devil
and
hell
but
it
was
otherwise
with
badman
for
to
my
knowledge
this
his
way
of
lying
was
a
great
grief
to
his
parents
for
their
hearts
were
much
dejected
at
this
beginning
of
their
son
nor
did
there
want
counsel
and
correction
from
them
to
him
if
that
would
have
made
him
better
he
wanted
not
to
be
told
in
my
hearing
and
that
over
and
over
and
over
that
all
lyars
should
have
their
part
in
the
lake
that
burns
with
fire
and
brimstone
and
that
whosoever
loveth
and
maketh
a
lye
should
not
have
any
part
in
the
new
and
heavenly
jerusalem
but
all
availed
nothing
with
him
when
a
fit
or
an
occasion
to
lie
came
upon
him
he
would
invent
tell
and
stand
to
his
lie
as
steadfastly
as
if
it
had
been
the
biggest
of
truths
that
he
told
and
that
with
that
hardening
of
his
heart
and
face
that
it
would
be
to
those
that
stood
by
a
wonder
nay
and
this
he
would
doe
when
under
the
rod
of
correction
which
is
appointed
by
god
for
parents
to
use
that
thereby
they
might
keep
their
children
from
hell
atten
truly
it
was
as
i
said
a
bad
beginning
he
served
the
devil
betimes
yea
he
became
a
nurse
to
one
of
his
brats
for
a
spirit
of
lying
is
the
devils
brat
for
he
is
a
liar
and
the
father
of
it
wise
right
he
is
the
father
of
it
indeed
a
lie
is
begot
by
the
devil
as
the
father
and
is
brought
forth
by
the
wicked
heart
as
the
mother
wherefore
another
scripture
also
saith
why
hath
satan
filled
thy
heart
to
lye
yea
he
calleth
the
heart
that
is
big
with
a
lye
an
heart
that
hath
conceived
that
is
by
the
devil
why
hast
thou
conceived
this
thing
in
thy
heart
thou
hast
not
lied
unto
men
but
unto
god
true
his
lye
was
a
lye
of
the
highest
nature
but
every
lye
hath
the
same
father
and
mother
as
had
the
lie
last
spoken
of
for
he
is
a
lier
and
the
father
of
it
a
lie
then
is
the
brat
of
hell
and
it
can
not
be
in
the
heart
before
the
person
has
committed
a
kind
of
spiritual
adultery
with
the
devil
that
soul
therefore
that
telleth
a
known
lie
has
lien
with
and
conceived
it
by
lying
with
the
devil
the
only
father
of
lies
for
a
lie
has
only
one
father
and
mother
the
devil
and
the
heart
no
marvel
therefore
if
the
hearts
that
hatch
and
bring
forth
lies
be
so
much
of
complexion
with
the
devil
yea
no
marvel
though
god
and
christ
have
so
bent
their
word
against
lyers
a
lyer
is
weded
to
the
devil
himself
atten
it
seems
a
marvellous
thing
in
mine
eyes
that
since
a
lye
is
the
offspring
of
the
devill
and
since
a
lye
brings
the
soul
to
the
very
den
of
devils
to
wit
the
dark
dungeon
of
hell
that
men
should
be
so
desperately
wicked
as
to
accustom
themselves
to
so
horrible
a
thing
wise
it
seems
also
marvellous
to
me
specially
when
i
observe
for
how
little
a
matter
some
men
will
study
contrive
make
and
tell
a
lye
you
shall
have
some
that
will
lye
it
over
and
over
and
that
for
a
peny
profit
yea
lye
and
stand
in
it
although
they
know
that
they
lye
yea
you
shall
have
some
men
that
will
not
stick
to
tell
lye
after
lye
though
themselves
get
nothing
thereby
they
will
tell
lyes
in
their
ordinary
discourse
with
their
neighbours
also
their
news
their
jests
and
their
tales
must
needs
be
adorned
with
lyes
or
else
they
seem
to
bear
no
good
sound
to
the
ear
nor
shew
much
to
the
fancie
of
him
to
whom
they
are
told
but
alas
what
will
these
lyers
doe
when
for
their
lyes
they
shall
be
tumbled
down
into
hell
to
that
devil
that
did
beget
those
lyes
in
their
heart
and
so
be
tormented
by
fire
and
brimstone
with
him
and
that
for
ever
and
ever
for
their
lyes
atten
can
you
not
give
one
some
example
of
gods
judgements
upon
lyers
that
one
may
tell
them
to
lyers
when
one
hears
them
lye
if
perhaps
they
may
by
the
hearing
thereof
be
made
afraid
and
ashamed
to
lye
wise
examples
why
saphira
and
his
wife
are
examples
enough
to
put
a
stop
one
would
think
to
a
spirit
addicted
thereto
for
they
both
were
stricken
down
dead
for
telling
a
lye
and
that
by
god
himself
in
the
midst
of
a
company
of
people
but
if
gods
threatning
of
liers
with
and
with
the
loss
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
will
not
prevail
with
them
to
leave
off
to
lie
and
make
lies
it
can
not
be
imagined
that
a
relation
of
temporal
judgements
that
have
swept
liers
out
of
the
world
heretofore
should
do
it
now
as
i
said
this
lying
was
one
of
the
first
sins
that
badman
was
addicted
to
and
he
could
make
them
and
tell
them
fearfully
atten
i
am
sorry
to
hear
this
of
him
and
so
much
the
more
because
as
i
fear
this
sin
did
not
reign
in
him
alone
for
usually
one
that
is
accustomed
to
lying
is
also
accustomed
to
other
evils
besides
and
if
it
were
not
so
also
with
badman
it
would
be
indeed
a
wonder
wise
you
say
true
the
lier
is
a
captive
slave
of
more
than
the
spirit
of
lying
and
therefore
this
badman
as
he
was
a
lier
from
a
child
so
he
was
also
much
given
to
pilfer
and
steal
so
that
what
he
could
as
we
say
handsomly
lay
his
hands
on
that
was
counted
his
own
whether
they
were
the
things
of
his
fellow
children
or
if
he
could
lay
hold
of
any
thing
at
a
neighbours
house
he
would
take
it
away
you
must
understand
me
of
trifles
for
being
let
but
a
child
he
attempted
no
great
matter
especially
at
first
but
yet
as
he
grew
up
in
strength
and
ripeness
of
wit
so
he
attempted
to
pilfer
and
steal
things
still
of
more
value
than
at
first
he
took
at
last
great
pleasure
in
robbing
of
gardens
and
orchards
and
as
he
grew
up
to
steal
pullen
from
the
neighbourhood
yea
what
was
his
fathers
could
not
escape
his
fingers
all
was
fish
that
came
to
his
net
so
hardened
at
last
was
he
in
this
mischief
also
atten
you
make
me
wonder
more
and
more
what
play
the
thief
too
what
play
the
thief
so
soon
he
could
not
but
know
though
he
was
but
a
child
that
what
he
took
from
others
was
none
of
his
own
besides
if
his
father
was
a
good
man
as
you
say
it
could
not
be
but
he
must
also
hear
from
him
that
to
steal
was
to
transgress
the
law
of
god
and
so
to
run
the
hazard
of
eternal
damnation
wise
his
father
was
not
wanting
to
use
the
means
to
reclaim
him
often
urging
as
i
have
been
told
that
saying
in
the
law
of
moses
thou
shalt
not
steal
and
also
that
this
is
the
curse
that
goeth
forth
over
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
for
every
one
that
stealeth
shall
be
cut
off
the
light
of
nature
also
though
he
was
little
must
needs
shew
him
that
what
he
took
from
others
was
not
his
own
and
that
he
would
not
willingly
have
been
served
so
himself
but
all
was
to
no
purpose
let
father
and
conscience
say
what
they
would
to
him
he
would
go
on
he
was
resolved
to
go
on
in
his
wickedness
atten
but
his
father
would
as
you
intimate
sometimes
rebuke
him
for
his
wickedness
pray
how
would
he
carry
it
then
wise
how
why
like
to
a
thief
that
is
found
he
would
stand
gloating
and
hanging
down
his
head
in
a
sullen
pouching
manner
a
body
might
read
as
we
use
to
say
the
picture
of
in
his
face
and
when
his
father
did
demand
his
answer
to
such
questions
concerning
his
villany
he
would
grumble
and
mutter
at
him
and
that
should
be
all
he
could
get
atten
but
you
said
that
he
would
also
rob
his
father
methinks
that
was
an
unnatural
thing
wise
natural
or
unnatural
all
is
one
to
a
thief
beside
you
must
think
that
he
had
likewise
companions
to
whom
he
was
for
the
wickedness
that
he
saw
in
them
more
firmly
knit
than
either
to
father
or
mother
yea
and
what
had
he
cared
if
father
and
mother
had
died
for
grief
for
him
their
death
would
have
been
as
he
would
have
counted
great
release
and
liberty
to
him
for
the
truth
is
they
and
their
counsel
was
his
bondage
yea
and
if
i
forget
not
i
have
heard
some
say
that
when
he
was
at
times
among
his
companions
he
would
greatly
rejoyce
to
think
that
his
parents
were
old
and
could
not
live
long
and
then
quoth
he
i
shall
be
mine
own
man
to
do
what
i
list
without
their
controul
atten
then
it
seems
he
counted
that
robbing
of
his
parents
was
no
crime
wise
none
at
all
and
therefore
he
fell
directly
under
that
sentence
whoso
robbeth
his
father
or
his
mother
and
saith
it
is
no
transgression
the
same
is
the
companion
of
a
destroyer
and
for
that
he
set
so
light
by
them
as
to
their
persons
and
counsels
twas
a
sign
that
at
present
he
was
of
a
very
abominable
spirit
and
that
some
judgement
waited
to
take
hold
of
him
in
time
to
come
atten
but
can
you
imagin
what
it
was
i
mean
in
his
conceit
for
i
speak
not
now
of
the
suggestions
of
satan
by
which
doubtless
he
was
put
on
to
do
these
things
i
say
what
it
should
be
in
his
conceit
that
should
make
him
think
that
this
his
manner
of
pilfering
and
stealing
was
no
great
matter
wise
it
was
for
that
the
things
that
he
stole
were
small
to
rob
orchards
and
gardens
and
to
steal
pullen
and
the
like
these
he
counted
tricks
of
youth
nor
would
he
be
beat
out
of
it
by
all
that
his
friends
could
say
they
would
tell
him
that
he
must
not
covet
or
desire
and
yet
to
desire
is
less
than
to
take
even
any
thing
the
least
thing
that
was
his
neighbours
and
that
if
he
did
it
would
be
a
transgression
of
the
law
but
all
was
one
to
him
what
through
the
wicked
talk
of
his
companions
and
the
delusion
of
his
own
corrupt
heart
he
would
go
on
in
his
pilfering
course
and
where
he
thought
himself
secure
would
talk
of
and
laugh
at
it
when
he
had
done
picture
take
note
symbol
atten
well
i
heard
a
man
once
when
he
was
upon
the
ladder
with
the
rope
about
his
neck
confess
when
ready
to
be
turned
off
by
the
hangman
that
that
which
had
brought
him
to
that
end
was
his
accustoming
of
himself
when
young
to
pilfer
and
steal
small
things
to
my
best
remembrance
he
told
us
that
he
began
the
trade
of
a
thief
by
stealing
pins
and
points
and
therefore
did
forewarn
all
the
youth
that
then
were
gathered
together
to
see
him
die
to
take
heed
of
beginning
though
but
with
little
sins
because
by
tampering
at
first
with
little
ones
way
is
made
for
the
commission
of
bigger
wise
since
you
are
entred
upon
storyes
i
also
will
tell
you
one
the
which
though
i
heard
it
not
with
mine
own
ears
yet
my
author
i
dare
believe
it
is
concerning
one
old
tod
that
was
hanged
about
twenty
years
agoe
or
more
at
hartford
for
being
a
thief
the
story
is
this
picture
take
note
symbol
at
a
summer
assizes
holden
at
hartfor
d
while
the
judge
was
sitting
upon
the
bench
comes
this
old
tod
into
the
court
cloathed
in
a
green
suit
with
his
leathern
girdle
in
his
hand
his
bosom
open
and
all
on
a
dung
sweat
as
if
he
had
run
for
his
life
and
being
come
in
he
spake
aloud
as
follows
my
lord
said
he
here
is
the
veryest
rogue
that
breaths
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
i
have
been
a
thief
from
a
child
when
i
was
but
a
little
one
i
gave
my
self
to
rob
orchards
and
to
do
other
such
like
wicked
things
and
i
have
continued
a
thief
ever
since
my
lord
there
has
not
been
a
robbery
committed
thus
many
years
within
so
many
miles
if
this
place
but
i
have
either
been
at
it
or
privy
to
it
the
judge
thought
the
fellow
was
mad
but
after
some
conference
with
some
of
the
justices
they
agreed
to
indict
him
and
so
they
did
of
several
felonious
actions
to
all
which
he
heartily
confessed
guilty
and
so
was
hanged
with
his
wife
at
the
same
time
atten
this
is
a
remarkable
story
indeed
and
you
think
it
is
a
true
one
wise
it
is
not
only
remarkable
but
pat
to
our
purpose
this
thief
like
badman
began
his
trade
betimes
he
began
too
where
badman
began
even
at
robbing
of
orchards
and
other
such
things
which
brought
him
as
you
may
perceive
from
sin
to
sin
till
at
last
it
brought
him
to
the
publick
shame
of
sin
which
is
the
gallows
as
for
the
truth
of
this
story
the
relator
told
me
that
he
was
at
the
same
time
himself
in
the
court
and
stood
within
less
than
two
yards
of
old
tod
when
he
heard
him
aloud
to
utter
the
words
atten
these
two
sins
of
lying
and
stealing
were
a
bad
sign
of
an
evil
end
wise
so
they
were
and
yet
badman
came
not
to
his
end
like
old
tod
though
i
fear
to
as
bad
nay
worse
than
was
that
death
of
the
gallows
though
less
discerned
by
spectators
but
more
of
that
by
and
by
but
you
talk
of
these
two
sins
as
if
these
were
all
that
badman
was
addicted
to
in
his
youth
alas
alas
he
swarmed
with
sins
even
as
a
begger
does
with
vermin
and
that
when
he
was
but
a
boy
atten
why
what
other
sins
was
he
addicted
to
i
mean
while
he
was
but
a
child
wise
you
need
not
ask
to
what
other
sins
was
he
but
to
what
other
sins
was
he
not
addicted
that
is
of
such
as
suited
with
his
age
for
a
man
may
safely
say
that
nothing
that
was
vile
came
amiss
to
him
if
he
was
but
capable
to
do
it
indeed
some
sins
there
be
that
childhood
knows
not
how
to
be
tampering
with
but
i
speak
of
sins
that
he
was
capable
of
committing
of
which
i
will
nominate
two
or
three
more
and
first
he
could
not
endure
the
lords
day
because
of
the
holiness
that
did
attend
it
the
beginning
of
that
day
was
to
him
as
if
he
was
going
to
prison
except
he
could
get
out
from
his
father
and
mother
and
lurk
in
among
his
companions
untill
holy
duties
were
over
reading
the
scriptures
hearing
sermons
godly
conference
repeating
of
sermons
and
prayer
were
things
that
he
could
not
away
with
and
therefore
if
his
father
on
such
days
as
often
he
did
though
sometimes
notwithstanding
his
diligence
he
would
be
sure
to
give
him
the
slip
did
keep
him
strictly
to
the
observation
of
the
day
he
would
plainly
shew
by
all
carriages
that
he
was
highly
discontent
therewith
he
would
sleep
at
duties
would
talk
vainly
with
his
brothers
and
as
it
were
think
every
godly
opportunity
seven
times
as
long
as
it
was
gruding
till
it
was
over
atten
this
his
abhorring
of
that
day
was
not
i
think
for
the
sake
of
the
day
itself
for
as
it
is
a
day
it
is
nothing
else
but
as
other
days
of
the
week
but
i
suppose
it
were
think
every
godly
as
it
was
grudging
till
it
that
day
was
not
i
think
as
it
is
a
day
it
is
nothing
of
the
week
but
i
suppose
that
the
reason
of
his
loathing
of
it
was
for
that
god
hath
put
sanctity
and
holiness
upon
it
also
because
it
is
the
day
above
all
the
days
of
the
week
that
ought
to
be
spent
in
holy
devotion
in
remembrance
of
our
lords
resurrection
from
the
dead
wise
yes
twas
therefore
that
he
was
such
an
enemy
to
it
even
because
more
restraint
was
laid
upon
him
on
that
day
from
his
own
ways
than
were
possible
should
be
laid
upon
him
on
all
others
atten
doth
not
god
by
instituting
of
a
day
unto
holy
duties
make
great
proof
how
the
hearts
and
inclinations
of
poor
people
do
stand
to
holiness
of
heart
and
a
conversation
in
h
oly
duties
wise
yes
doubtless
and
a
man
shall
shew
his
heart
and
his
life
what
they
are
more
by
one
than
by
all
the
days
of
the
week
besides
and
the
reason
is
because
on
the
there
is
a
special
restraint
laid
upon
men
as
to
thoughts
and
life
more
than
upon
other
days
of
the
week
besides
also
men
are
enjoyned
on
that
day
to
a
stricter
performance
of
holy
duties
and
restraint
of
worldly
business
than
upon
other
days
they
are
wherefore
if
their
hearts
incline
not
naturally
to
good
now
they
will
shew
it
now
they
will
appear
what
they
are
the
lords
day
is
a
kind
of
an
emblem
of
the
heavenly
sabbath
above
and
it
makes
manifest
how
the
heart
stands
to
the
perpetuity
of
holiness
more
than
to
be
found
in
a
transient
duty
does
on
other
days
a
man
may
be
in
and
out
of
holy
duties
and
all
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
but
now
the
lords
day
is
as
it
were
a
day
that
enjoyns
to
one
perpetual
duty
of
holiness
remember
that
thou
keep
holy
the
sabbath
day
which
by
christ
is
not
abrogated
but
changed
into
the
first
of
the
week
not
as
it
was
given
in
particular
to
the
jews
but
as
it
was
sanctified
by
him
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
and
therefore
is
a
greater
proof
of
the
frame
and
temper
of
a
mans
heart
and
does
more
make
manifest
to
what
he
is
inclined
than
doth
his
other
performance
of
duties
therefore
god
puts
great
difference
between
them
that
truly
call
and
walk
in
this
day
as
holy
and
count
it
honourable
upon
the
account
that
now
they
have
an
opportunity
to
shew
how
they
delight
to
honour
him
in
that
they
have
not
only
an
hour
but
a
whole
day
to
shew
it
in
i
say
he
puts
great
difference
between
these
and
that
other
sort
that
say
when
will
the
sabbath
be
gone
that
we
may
be
at
our
worldly
business
the
first
he
calleth
a
blessed
man
but
brandeth
the
other
for
an
unsanctified
worldling
and
indeed
to
delight
ourselves
in
gods
service
upon
his
holy
days
gives
a
better
proof
of
a
sanctified
nature
than
to
grudge
at
the
coming
and
to
be
weary
of
the
holy
duties
of
such
dayes
as
badman
did
atten
there
may
be
something
in
what
you
say
for
he
that
can
not
abide
to
keep
one
day
holy
to
god
to
be
sure
he
hath
given
a
sufficient
proof
that
he
is
an
unsanctified
man
and
as
such
what
should
he
do
in
heaven
that
being
the
place
where
a
perpetual
sabath
is
to
be
kept
to
god
i
say
to
be
kept
for
ever
and
ever
and
for
ought
i
know
one
reason
why
one
day
in
seven
hath
been
by
our
lord
set
apart
unto
holy
duties
for
men
may
be
to
give
them
conviction
that
there
is
enmity
in
the
hearts
of
sinners
to
the
god
of
heaven
for
he
that
hateth
holiness
hateth
god
himself
they
pretend
to
love
god
and
yet
love
not
a
holy
day
and
yet
love
not
to
spend
that
day
in
one
continued
act
of
holiness
to
the
lord
they
had
as
good
say
nothing
as
to
call
him
lord
lord
and
yet
not
doe
the
things
that
he
says
and
this
badman
was
such
an
one
he
could
not
abide
this
day
nor
any
of
the
duties
of
it
indeed
when
he
could
get
from
his
friends
and
so
spend
it
in
all
manner
of
idleness
and
profaneness
then
he
would
be
pleased
well
enough
but
what
was
this
but
a
turning
the
day
into
night
or
other
than
taking
an
opportunity
at
gods
forbidding
to
follow
our
callings
to
solace
and
satisfie
our
lusts
and
delights
of
the
flesh
i
take
the
liberty
to
speak
thus
of
badman
upon
a
confidence
of
what
you
sir
have
said
of
him
is
true
wise
you
needed
not
to
have
made
that
apology
for
your
censuring
of
badman
for
all
that
knew
him
will
confirm
what
you
said
of
him
to
be
true
he
could
not
abide
either
that
day
or
any
thing
else
that
had
the
stamp
or
image
of
god
upon
it
sin
sin
and
to
do
the
thing
that
was
naught
was
that
which
he
delighted
in
and
that
from
a
little
child
atten
i
must
say
again
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
and
that
for
his
own
sake
and
also
for
the
sake
of
his
relations
who
must
needs
be
broken
to
pieces
with
such
doings
as
these
for
for
these
things
sake
comes
the
wrath
of
god
upon
the
children
of
disobedience
and
doubtless
he
must
be
gone
to
hell
if
he
died
without
repentance
and
to
beget
a
child
for
hell
is
sad
for
parents
to
think
on
wise
of
his
dying
as
i
told
you
i
will
give
you
a
relation
anon
but
now
we
are
upon
his
life
and
upon
the
manner
of
his
life
in
his
childhood
even
of
the
sins
that
attended
him
then
some
of
which
i
have
mentioned
already
and
indeed
i
have
mentioned
but
some
for
yet
there
are
more
to
follow
and
those
not
at
all
inferiour
to
what
you
have
already
heard
atten
pray
what
were
they
wise
why
he
was
greatly
given
and
that
while
a
lad
to
grievous
swearing
and
cursing
yea
he
then
made
no
more
of
swearing
and
cursing
than
i
do
of
telling
my
fingers
yea
he
would
do
it
without
provocation
thereto
he
counted
it
a
glory
to
swear
and
curse
and
it
was
as
natural
to
him
as
to
eat
and
drink
and
sleep
atten
oh
what
a
young
villain
was
this
here
is
as
the
apostle
says
a
yielding
of
members
as
instruments
of
unrighteousness
unto
sin
indeed
this
is
proceeding
from
evil
to
evil
with
a
witness
this
argueth
that
he
was
a
young
wretch
indeed
wise
he
was
so
and
yet
as
i
told
you
he
counted
above
all
this
kind
of
sinning
to
be
a
badge
of
his
honour
he
reckoned
himself
a
mans
fellow
when
he
had
learnt
to
swear
and
curse
boldly
atten
i
am
perswaded
that
many
do
think
as
you
have
said
that
to
swear
is
a
thing
that
does
bravely
become
them
and
that
it
is
the
best
way
for
a
man
when
he
would
put
authority
or
terrour
into
his
words
to
stuff
them
full
of
the
sin
of
swearing
wise
you
say
right
else
as
i
am
perswaded
men
would
not
so
usually
belch
out
their
blasphemous
oaths
as
they
do
they
take
a
pride
in
it
they
think
that
to
swear
is
and
having
once
accustomed
themselves
unto
it
they
hardly
leave
it
all
the
days
of
their
lives
atten
well
but
now
we
are
upon
it
pray
shew
me
the
difference
between
swearing
and
cursing
for
there
is
a
difference
is
there
not
wise
yes
there
is
a
difference
between
swearing
and
cursing
swearing
vain
swearing
such
as
young
badman
accustomed
himself
unto
now
vain
and
sinful
swearing
is
a
light
and
wicked
calling
of
god
to
witness
to
our
vain
and
foolish
attesting
of
things
and
those
things
are
of
two
sorts
things
that
we
swear
are
or
shall
be
done
things
so
sworn
to
true
or
false
things
that
we
swear
are
or
shall
be
done
thou
swearest
thou
hast
done
such
a
thing
that
such
a
thing
is
so
or
shall
be
so
for
it
is
no
matter
which
of
these
it
is
that
men
swear
about
if
it
be
done
lightly
and
wickedly
and
groundlesly
it
is
vain
because
it
is
a
sin
against
the
third
commandement
which
says
thou
shalt
not
take
the
name
of
the
lord
thy
god
in
vain
for
this
is
a
vain
using
of
that
holy
and
sacred
name
and
so
a
sin
for
which
without
sound
repentance
there
is
not
nor
can
be
rightly
expected
forgiveness
atten
then
it
seems
though
as
to
the
matter
of
fact
a
man
swears
truely
yet
if
he
sweareth
lightly
and
groundlesly
his
oath
is
evil
and
he
by
it
under
sin
wise
yes
a
man
may
say
the
lord
liveth
and
that
is
true
and
yet
in
so
saying
swear
falsly
because
he
sweareth
vainly
needlesly
and
without
a
ground
to
swear
groundedly
and
necessarily
which
then
a
man
does
when
he
swears
as
being
called
thereto
of
god
that
is
tolerated
of
the
word
but
this
was
none
of
badmans
swearing
and
therefore
that
which
now
we
are
not
concerned
about
atten
i
perceive
by
the
prophet
that
a
man
may
sin
in
swearing
to
a
truth
they
therefore
must
needs
most
horribly
sin
that
swear
to
confirm
their
jests
and
lies
and
as
they
think
the
better
to
beautifie
their
foolish
talking
wise
they
sin
with
an
high
hand
for
they
presume
to
imagine
that
god
is
as
wicked
as
themselves
to
wit
that
he
is
an
avoucher
of
lies
to
be
true
for
as
i
said
before
to
swear
is
to
call
god
to
witness
and
to
swear
to
a
lie
is
to
call
god
himself
to
witness
that
that
lie
is
true
this
therefore
must
needs
offend
for
it
puts
the
highest
affront
upon
the
holiness
and
righteousness
of
god
therefore
his
wrath
must
sweep
them
away
this
kind
of
swearing
is
put
in
with
lying
and
killing
and
stealing
and
committing
adultery
and
therefore
must
not
go
unpunished
for
if
god
will
not
hold
him
guiltless
that
taketh
his
name
in
vain
which
a
man
may
doe
when
he
swears
to
a
truth
as
i
have
shewed
before
how
can
it
be
imagined
that
he
should
hold
such
guiltless
who
by
swearing
will
appeal
to
god
if
lies
be
not
true
or
that
swear
out
of
their
frantick
and
bedlam
madness
it
would
grieve
and
provoke
a
sober
man
to
wrath
if
one
should
swear
to
a
notorious
lye
and
avouch
that
that
man
would
attest
it
for
a
truth
and
yet
thus
do
men
deal
with
the
holy
god
they
tell
their
jestings
tales
and
lies
and
then
swear
by
god
that
they
are
true
now
this
kind
of
swearing
was
as
common
with
young
badman
as
it
was
to
eat
when
he
was
an
hungred
or
to
go
to
bed
when
it
was
night
atten
i
have
often
mused
in
my
mind
what
it
should
be
that
should
make
men
so
common
in
the
use
of
the
sin
of
swearing
since
those
that
be
wise
will
believe
them
never
the
sooner
for
that
wise
it
can
not
be
any
thing
that
is
good
you
may
be
sure
because
the
thing
it
self
is
abominable
therefore
it
must
be
from
the
promptings
of
the
spirit
of
the
devil
within
them
also
it
flows
sometimes
from
hellish
rage
when
the
tongue
hath
set
on
fire
of
hell
even
the
whole
course
of
nature
but
commonly
swearing
flows
from
that
daring
boldness
that
biddeth
defiance
to
the
law
that
forbids
it
swearers
think
also
that
by
their
belching
of
their
blasphemous
oaths
out
of
their
black
and
polluted
mouths
they
shew
themselves
the
more
valiant
men
and
imagine
also
that
by
these
outrageous
kind
of
villianies
they
shall
conquer
those
that
at
such
a
time
they
have
to
do
with
and
make
them
believe
their
lyes
to
be
true
they
also
swear
frequently
to
get
gain
thereby
and
when
they
meet
with
fools
they
overcome
them
this
way
but
if
i
might
give
advice
in
this
matter
no
buyer
should
lay
out
one
farthing
with
him
that
is
a
common
swearer
in
his
calling
especially
with
such
an
that
endeavoureth
to
swear
away
his
commodity
to
another
and
that
would
swear
his
chapmans
money
into
his
own
pocket
atten
all
these
causes
of
swearing
so
far
as
i
can
perceive
flow
from
the
same
root
as
doe
the
oaths
themselves
even
from
a
hardened
and
desperate
heart
but
pray
shew
me
now
how
wicked
cursing
is
to
be
distinguished
from
this
kind
of
swearing
wise
swearing
as
i
said
hath
immediately
to
do
with
the
name
of
god
and
it
calls
upon
him
to
be
witness
to
the
truth
of
what
is
said
that
is
if
they
that
swear
swear
by
him
some
indeed
swear
by
idols
as
by
the
mass
by
our
lady
by
saints
beasts
birds
and
other
creatures
but
the
usual
way
of
our
profane
ones
in
england
is
to
swear
by
god
christ
faith
and
the
like
but
however
or
by
whatever
they
swear
cursing
is
distinguished
from
swearing
thus
to
curse
to
curse
profanely
it
is
to
sentence
another
or
our
self
for
or
to
evil
or
to
wish
that
some
evil
might
happen
to
the
person
or
thing
under
the
curse
unjustly
it
is
to
sentence
for
or
to
evil
that
is
without
a
cause
thus
shimei
cursed
david
he
sentenced
him
for
and
to
evil
unjustly
when
he
said
to
him
come
out
come
out
thou
bloody
man
and
thou
man
of
belial
the
lord
hath
returned
upon
thee
all
the
blood
of
the
house
of
saul
in
whose
stead
thou
hast
reigned
and
the
lord
hath
delivered
the
kingdom
into
the
hand
of
absalom
thy
son
and
behold
thou
art
taken
in
thy
mischief
because
thou
art
a
bloody
man
this
david
calls
a
grievous
curse
and
behold
saith
he
to
solomon
his
son
thou
hast
with
thee
shimei
a
benjamite
which
cursed
me
with
a
grievous
curse
in
the
day
when
i
went
to
mahanaim
but
what
was
this
curse
why
first
it
was
a
wrong
sentence
past
upon
david
shimei
called
him
bloody
man
man
of
belial
when
he
was
not
secondly
he
sentenced
him
to
the
evil
that
at
present
was
upon
him
for
being
a
bloody
man
that
is
against
the
house
of
saul
when
that
present
evil
overtook
david
for
quite
another
thing
and
we
may
thus
apply
it
to
the
profane
ones
of
our
times
who
in
their
rage
and
envy
have
little
else
in
their
mouths
but
a
sentence
against
their
neighbour
for
and
to
evil
unjustly
how
common
is
it
with
many
when
they
are
but
a
little
offended
with
one
to
cry
hang
him
damn
him
rogue
this
is
both
a
sentencing
of
him
for
and
to
evil
and
is
in
it
self
a
grievous
curse
the
other
kind
of
cursing
is
to
wish
that
some
evil
might
happen
to
and
overtake
this
or
that
person
or
thing
and
this
kind
of
cursing
job
counted
a
grievous
sin
i
have
not
suffered
says
he
my
mouth
to
sin
by
wishing
a
curse
to
his
soul
or
consequently
to
body
or
estate
this
then
is
a
wicked
cursing
to
wish
that
evil
might
either
befall
another
or
our
selves
and
this
kind
of
cursing
young
badman
accustomed
himself
unto
he
would
wish
that
evil
might
befall
others
he
would
wish
their
necks
broken
or
that
their
brains
were
out
or
that
the
pox
or
plague
was
upon
them
and
the
like
all
which
is
a
devilish
kind
of
cursing
and
is
become
one
of
the
common
sins
of
our
age
he
would
also
as
often
wish
a
curse
to
himself
saying
would
i
might
be
hanged
or
burned
or
that
the
devil
might
fetch
me
if
it
be
not
so
or
the
like
we
count
the
damme
blades
to
be
great
swearers
but
when
in
their
hellish
fury
they
say
me
god
perish
me
or
the
like
they
rather
curse
than
swear
yea
curse
themselves
and
that
with
a
wish
that
damnation
might
light
upon
themselves
which
wish
and
curse
of
theirs
in
a
little
time
they
will
see
accomplished
upon
them
even
in
if
they
repent
not
of
their
sins
atten
but
did
this
young
badman
accustom
himself
to
such
filthy
kind
of
language
wise
i
think
i
may
say
that
nothing
was
more
frequent
in
his
mouth
and
that
upon
the
least
provocation
yea
he
was
so
versed
in
such
kind
of
language
that
neither
father
nor
mother
nor
brother
nor
sister
nor
servant
no
nor
the
very
cattel
that
his
father
had
could
escape
these
curses
of
his
i
say
that
even
the
bruit
beasts
when
he
drove
them
or
rid
upon
them
if
they
pleased
not
his
humour
they
must
be
sure
to
partake
of
his
curse
he
would
wish
their
necks
broke
their
legs
broke
their
guts
out
or
that
the
devil
might
fetch
them
or
the
like
and
no
marvel
for
he
that
is
so
hardy
to
wish
damnation
or
other
bad
curses
to
himself
or
dearest
relations
will
not
stick
to
wish
evil
to
the
silly
beast
in
his
madness
atten
well
i
see
still
that
this
badman
was
a
desperate
villain
but
pray
sir
since
you
have
gone
thus
far
now
shew
me
whence
this
evil
of
cursing
ariseth
and
also
what
dishonour
it
bringeth
to
god
for
i
easily
discern
that
it
doth
bring
damnation
to
the
soul
wise
this
evil
of
cursing
ariseth
in
general
from
the
desperate
wickedness
of
the
heart
but
particularly
from
envie
which
is
as
i
apprehend
the
leading
sin
to
witchcraft
it
also
ariseth
from
pride
which
was
the
sin
of
the
fallen
angels
it
ariseth
too
from
scorn
and
contempt
of
others
but
for
a
man
to
curse
himself
must
needs
arise
from
desperate
madness
the
dishonour
that
it
bringeth
to
god
is
this
it
taketh
away
from
him
his
authority
in
whose
power
it
is
onely
to
bless
and
curse
not
to
curse
wickedly
as
badman
but
justly
and
righteously
giving
by
his
curse
to
those
that
are
wicked
the
due
reward
of
their
deeds
besides
these
wicked
men
in
their
wicked
cursing
of
their
neighbour
do
even
curse
god
himself
in
his
handy
work
man
is
gods
image
and
to
curse
wickedly
the
image
of
god
is
to
curse
god
himself
therefore
as
when
men
wickedly
swear
they
rend
and
tare
gods
name
and
make
him
as
much
as
in
them
lies
the
avoucher
and
approver
of
all
their
wickedness
so
he
that
curseth
and
condemneth
in
this
sort
his
neighbour
or
that
wisheth
him
evil
curseth
condemneth
and
wisheth
evil
to
the
image
of
god
and
consequently
judgeth
and
condemneth
god
himself
suppose
that
a
man
should
say
with
his
mouth
i
wish
that
the
kings
picture
was
burned
would
not
this
mans
so
saying
render
him
as
an
enemy
to
the
person
of
the
king
even
so
it
is
with
them
that
by
cursing
wish
evil
to
their
neighbour
or
to
themselves
they
contemn
the
image
even
the
image
of
god
himself
atten
but
do
you
think
that
the
men
that
do
thus
do
think
that
they
do
so
vilely
so
abominably
wise
the
question
is
not
what
men
do
believe
concerning
their
sin
but
what
gods
word
says
of
it
if
gods
word
says
that
swearing
and
cursing
are
sins
though
men
should
count
them
for
vertues
their
reward
will
be
a
reward
for
sin
to
wit
the
damnation
of
the
soul
to
curse
another
and
to
swear
vainly
and
falsly
are
sins
against
the
light
of
nature
to
curse
is
so
because
whoso
curseth
another
knows
that
at
the
same
time
he
would
not
be
so
served
himself
to
swear
also
is
a
sin
against
the
same
law
for
nature
will
tell
me
that
i
should
not
lie
and
therefore
much
less
swear
to
confirm
it
yea
the
heathens
have
looked
upon
swearing
to
be
a
solemn
ordinance
of
god
and
therefore
not
to
be
lightly
or
vainly
used
by
men
though
to
confirm
a
matter
of
truth
atten
but
i
wonder
since
curseing
and
swearing
are
such
evils
in
the
eyes
of
god
that
he
doth
not
make
some
examples
to
others
for
their
committing
such
wickedness
picture
take
note
symbol
wise
alas
so
he
has
a
thousand
times
twice
told
as
may
be
easily
gathered
by
any
observing
people
in
every
age
and
countrey
i
could
present
you
with
several
my
self
but
waving
the
abundance
that
might
be
mentioned
i
will
here
present
you
with
two
one
was
that
dreadful
judgment
of
god
upon
one
at
wimbleton
in
surrey
who
after
a
horrible
fit
of
swearing
at
and
cursing
of
some
persons
that
did
not
please
him
suddenly
fell
sick
and
in
little
time
died
raving
cursing
and
swearing
but
above
all
take
that
dreadful
story
of
dorothy
mately
an
inhabitant
of
as
h
over
in
the
county
of
darby
picture
take
note
symbol
this
dorothy
mately
saith
the
relator
was
noted
by
the
people
of
the
town
to
be
a
great
swearer
and
curser
and
lier
and
thief
just
like
mr
badman
and
the
labour
that
she
did
usually
follow
was
to
wash
the
rubbish
that
came
forth
of
the
lead
mines
and
there
to
get
sparks
of
and
her
usual
way
of
asserting
of
things
was
with
these
kind
of
imprecations
i
would
i
might
sink
into
the
earth
if
it
be
not
so
or
i
would
god
would
make
the
earth
open
and
swallow
me
up
now
upon
the
of
march
this
dorothy
was
washing
of
ore
upon
the
top
of
a
steep
hill
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
ashover
and
was
there
taxed
by
a
lad
for
taking
of
two
single
pence
out
of
his
pocket
for
he
had
laid
his
breeches
by
and
was
at
work
in
his
drawers
but
she
violently
denyed
it
wishing
that
the
ground
might
swallow
her
up
if
she
had
them
she
also
used
the
same
wicked
words
on
several
other
occasions
that
day
now
one
george
hodgkinson
of
ashover
a
man
of
good
report
there
came
accidentally
by
where
this
dorothy
was
and
stood
still
a
while
to
talk
with
her
as
she
was
washing
her
ore
there
stood
also
a
little
child
by
her
and
another
a
distance
from
her
calling
aloud
to
her
to
come
away
wherefore
the
said
george
took
the
girle
by
the
hand
to
lead
her
away
to
her
that
called
her
but
behold
they
had
not
gone
above
ten
yards
from
dorothy
but
they
heard
her
crying
out
for
help
so
looking
back
he
saw
the
woman
and
her
tub
and
sive
twirling
round
and
sinking
into
the
ground
then
said
the
man
pray
to
god
to
pardon
thy
sin
for
thou
art
never
like
to
be
seen
alive
any
longer
so
she
and
her
tub
twirled
round
and
round
till
they
sunk
about
three
yards
into
the
earth
and
then
for
a
while
staid
then
she
called
for
help
again
thinking
as
she
said
that
she
should
stay
there
now
the
man
though
greatly
amazed
did
begin
to
think
which
way
to
help
her
but
immediately
a
great
stone
which
appeared
in
the
earth
fell
upon
her
head
and
brake
her
skull
and
then
the
earth
fell
in
upon
her
and
covered
her
she
was
afterwards
digged
up
and
found
about
four
yards
within
ground
with
the
boys
two
single
pence
in
her
pocket
but
her
tub
and
sive
could
not
be
found
picture
take
note
symbol
atten
you
bring
to
my
mind
a
sad
story
the
which
i
will
relate
unto
you
the
thing
is
this
about
a
from
where
i
once
dwelt
there
was
a
blind
and
the
man
that
kept
it
had
a
son
whose
name
was
edward
this
edward
was
as
it
were
an
both
in
his
words
and
manner
of
behaviour
to
this
blind
certain
jovial
companions
would
once
or
twice
a
week
come
and
this
ned
for
so
they
called
him
his
father
would
entertain
his
guests
withall
to
wit
by
calling
for
him
to
make
them
sport
by
his
foolish
words
and
gestures
so
when
these
boon
blades
came
to
this
mans
house
the
father
would
call
for
ned
ned
therefore
would
come
forth
and
the
villain
was
devilishly
addicted
to
cursing
yea
to
cursing
his
father
and
mother
and
any
one
else
that
did
cross
him
and
because
though
he
was
an
he
saw
that
his
practice
was
pleasing
he
would
do
it
with
the
more
audaciousness
well
when
these
brave
fellows
did
come
at
their
times
to
this
as
they
call
it
to
fuddle
and
make
merry
then
must
ned
be
called
out
and
because
his
father
was
best
acquainted
with
ned
and
best
knew
how
to
provoke
him
therefore
he
would
usually
ask
him
such
questions
or
command
him
such
business
as
would
be
sure
to
provoke
him
indeed
then
would
he
after
his
foolish
manner
curse
his
father
most
bitterly
at
which
the
old
man
would
laugh
and
so
would
the
rest
of
the
guests
as
at
that
which
pleased
them
best
still
continuing
to
ask
that
ned
still
might
be
provoked
to
curse
that
they
might
still
be
provoked
to
laugh
this
was
the
mirth
with
which
the
old
man
did
use
to
entertain
his
guests
the
curses
wherewith
this
ned
did
use
to
curse
his
father
and
at
which
the
old
man
would
laugh
were
these
and
such
like
the
devil
take
you
the
devil
fetch
you
he
would
also
wish
him
plagues
and
destructions
many
well
so
it
came
to
pass
through
the
righteous
judgement
of
god
that
neds
wishes
and
curses
were
in
a
little
time
fuelled
upon
his
father
for
not
many
months
passed
between
them
after
this
manner
but
the
devil
did
indeed
take
him
possess
him
and
also
in
few
days
carried
him
out
of
this
world
by
death
i
say
satan
did
take
him
and
possess
him
i
mean
so
it
was
judged
by
those
that
knew
him
and
had
to
do
with
him
in
that
his
lamentable
condition
he
could
feel
him
like
a
live
thing
goe
up
and
down
in
his
body
but
when
tormenting
time
was
come
as
he
had
often
tormenting
fits
then
he
would
lye
like
an
hard
bump
in
the
soft
place
of
his
chest
i
mean
i
saw
it
so
and
so
would
rent
and
tare
him
and
make
him
roar
till
he
died
away
i
told
you
before
that
i
was
an
ear
and
eye
witness
of
what
i
here
say
and
so
i
was
i
have
heard
ned
in
his
roguery
cursing
his
father
and
his
father
laughing
thereat
most
heartily
still
provoking
of
ned
to
curse
that
his
mirth
might
be
encreased
i
saw
his
father
also
when
he
was
possessed
i
saw
him
in
one
of
his
fits
and
saw
his
flesh
as
twas
thought
by
the
devil
gathered
up
on
an
heap
about
the
bigness
of
half
in
egge
to
the
unutterable
torture
and
afflict
i
on
of
the
old
man
there
was
also
one
freeman
who
was
more
than
an
ordinary
doctor
sent
for
to
cast
out
this
devil
and
i
was
there
when
he
attempted
to
do
it
the
manner
whereof
was
this
they
had
the
possessed
into
an
and
laid
him
on
his
belly
upon
a
form
with
his
head
hanging
over
the
forms
end
then
they
bound
him
down
thereto
which
done
they
set
a
pan
of
coals
under
his
mouth
and
put
something
therein
which
made
a
great
smoak
by
this
means
as
twas
said
to
fetch
out
the
devil
there
therefore
they
kept
the
man
till
he
was
almost
smothered
in
the
smoak
but
no
devil
came
out
of
him
at
which
freeman
was
somewhat
abashed
the
man
greatly
afflicted
and
i
made
to
go
away
wondering
and
fearing
in
a
little
time
therefore
that
which
possessed
the
man
carried
him
out
of
the
world
according
to
the
cursed
wishes
of
his
son
and
this
was
the
end
of
this
hellish
mirth
wise
these
were
all
sad
judgements
atten
these
were
dreadful
judgments
indeed
wise
ai
and
they
look
like
the
threatning
of
that
text
though
chiefly
it
concerned
judas
as
he
loved
cursing
so
let
it
come
unto
him
as
he
delighted
not
in
blessing
so
let
it
be
far
from
him
as
he
cloathed
himself
with
cursing
as
with
a
garment
so
let
it
come
into
his
bowels
like
water
and
as
oyl
into
his
bones
atten
it
is
a
fearful
thing
for
youth
to
be
trained
up
in
a
way
of
cursing
and
swearing
wise
trained
up
in
them
that
i
can
not
say
badman
was
for
his
father
hath
in
my
hearing
bewailed
the
badness
of
his
children
and
of
this
naughty
boy
in
particular
i
believe
that
the
wickedness
of
his
children
made
him
in
the
thoughts
of
it
goe
many
a
night
with
heavy
heart
to
bed
and
with
as
heavy
an
one
to
rise
in
the
morning
but
all
was
one
to
his
graceless
son
neither
wholsom
counsel
nor
fatherly
sorrow
would
make
him
mend
his
manners
there
are
some
indeed
that
do
train
up
their
children
to
swear
curse
lye
and
steal
and
great
is
the
misery
of
such
poor
children
whose
hard
hap
it
is
to
be
ushered
into
the
world
by
and
to
be
under
the
tuition
too
of
such
ungodly
parents
it
had
been
better
for
such
parents
had
they
not
begat
them
and
better
for
such
children
had
they
not
been
born
o
methinks
for
a
father
or
a
mother
to
train
up
a
child
in
that
very
way
that
leadeth
to
hell
and
damnation
what
thing
so
horrible
but
badman
was
not
by
his
parents
so
brought
up
atten
but
methinks
since
this
young
badman
would
not
be
ruled
at
home
his
father
should
have
tryed
what
good
could
have
been
done
of
him
abroad
by
putting
him
out
to
some
man
of
his
acquaintance
that
he
knew
to
be
able
to
command
him
and
to
keep
him
pretty
hard
to
some
employ
so
should
he
at
least
have
been
prevented
of
time
to
do
those
wickednesses
that
could
not
be
done
without
time
to
do
them
in
wise
alas
his
father
did
so
he
put
him
out
betimes
to
one
of
his
own
acquaintance
and
entreated
him
of
all
love
that
he
would
take
care
of
son
and
keep
him
from
extravagant
wayes
his
trade
also
was
honest
and
commodious
he
had
besides
a
full
employ
therein
so
that
this
young
badman
had
no
vacant
seasons
nor
idle
hours
yielded
him
by
his
calling
therein
to
take
opportunities
to
do
badly
but
all
was
one
to
him
as
he
had
begun
to
be
vile
in
his
fathers
house
even
so
he
continued
to
be
when
he
was
in
the
house
of
his
master
atten
i
have
known
some
children
who
though
they
have
been
very
bad
at
home
yet
have
altered
much
when
they
have
been
put
out
abroad
especially
when
they
have
fallen
into
a
family
where
the
governours
thereof
have
made
conscience
of
maintaining
of
the
worship
and
service
of
god
therein
but
perhaps
that
might
be
wanting
in
badmans
masters
house
wise
indeed
some
children
do
greatly
mend
when
put
under
other
mens
roofs
but
as
i
said
this
naughty
boy
did
not
so
nor
did
his
badness
continue
because
he
wanted
a
master
that
both
could
and
did
correct
it
for
his
master
was
a
very
good
man
a
very
devout
person
one
that
frequented
the
best
that
set
up
the
worship
of
god
in
his
family
and
also
that
walked
himself
thereafter
he
was
also
a
man
very
meek
and
merciful
one
that
did
never
overdrive
young
badman
in
business
nor
that
kept
him
at
it
at
unseasonable
hours
atten
say
you
so
this
is
rare
i
for
my
part
can
see
but
few
that
can
parallel
in
these
things
with
badmans
master
wise
nor
i
neither
yet
badman
had
such
an
one
for
for
the
most
past
masters
are
now
a
days
such
as
mind
nothing
but
their
worldly
concerns
and
if
apprentices
do
but
answer
their
commands
therein
soul
and
religion
may
go
whither
they
will
yea
i
much
fear
that
there
have
been
many
towardly
lads
put
out
by
their
parents
to
such
masters
that
have
quite
undone
them
as
to
the
next
world
atten
the
more
is
the
pity
but
pray
now
you
have
touched
upon
this
subject
shew
me
how
many
wages
a
master
may
be
the
ruin
of
his
poor
apprentice
wise
nay
i
can
not
tell
you
of
all
the
wayes
yet
some
of
them
i
will
mention
suppose
then
that
a
towardly
lad
be
put
to
be
an
apprentice
with
one
that
is
reputed
to
be
a
godly
man
yet
that
lad
may
be
ruined
many
wayes
that
is
if
his
master
be
not
circumspect
in
all
things
that
respect
both
god
and
man
and
that
before
his
apprentice
if
he
be
not
moderate
in
the
use
of
his
apprentice
if
he
drives
him
beyond
his
strength
if
he
holds
him
to
work
at
unseasonable
hours
if
he
will
not
allow
him
convenient
time
to
read
the
word
to
pray
this
is
the
way
to
destroy
him
that
is
in
those
tender
begin
n
ings
of
good
thoughts
and
good
beginnings
about
spiritual
things
if
he
suffers
his
house
to
be
scattered
with
profane
and
wicked
books
such
as
stir
up
to
lust
to
wantonness
such
as
teach
idle
wanton
lascivious
discourse
and
such
as
has
a
tendency
to
provoke
to
profane
drollery
and
jesting
and
lastly
such
as
tend
to
corrupt
and
pervert
the
doctrine
of
faith
and
holiness
all
these
things
will
eat
as
doth
a
canker
and
will
quickly
spoil
in
youth
those
good
beginnings
that
may
be
putting
forth
themselves
in
them
if
there
be
a
mixture
of
servants
that
is
if
some
very
bad
be
in
the
same
place
that
s
a
way
also
to
undo
such
tender
lads
for
they
that
are
bad
and
sordid
servants
will
be
often
and
they
have
an
opportunity
too
to
be
distilling
and
fomenting
of
their
profane
and
wicked
words
and
tricks
before
them
and
these
will
easily
stick
in
the
flesh
and
minds
of
youth
to
the
corrupting
of
them
if
the
master
have
one
guise
for
abroad
and
another
for
home
that
is
if
his
religion
hangs
by
in
his
house
as
his
cloak
does
and
he
be
seldom
in
it
except
he
be
abroad
this
young
beginners
will
take
notice
of
and
stumble
at
we
say
hedges
have
eyes
and
little
pitchers
have
ears
and
indeed
children
make
a
greater
inspection
into
the
lives
of
fathers
masters
than
they
are
aware
of
and
therefore
should
masters
be
carefull
else
they
may
soon
destroy
good
beginnings
in
their
servants
if
the
master
be
unconscionable
in
his
dealing
and
trades
with
lying
words
or
if
bad
commodities
be
avouched
to
be
good
or
if
he
seeks
after
unreasonable
gain
or
the
like
his
servant
sees
it
and
it
is
enough
to
undo
him
elies
sons
being
bad
before
the
congregation
made
men
despise
the
sacrifices
of
the
lord
but
these
things
by
the
by
only
they
may
serve
for
a
hint
to
masters
to
take
heed
that
they
take
not
apprentices
to
destroy
their
souls
but
young
badman
had
none
of
these
hinderances
his
father
took
care
and
provided
well
for
him
as
to
this
he
had
a
good
master
he
wanted
not
good
books
nor
good
instruction
nor
good
sermons
nor
good
examples
no
nor
good
neither
but
all
would
not
doe
atten
tis
a
wonder
that
in
such
a
family
amidst
so
many
spiritual
helps
nothing
should
take
hold
of
his
heart
what
not
good
books
nor
good
instructions
nor
good
sermons
nor
good
examples
nor
good
nor
nothing
do
him
good
wise
you
talk
he
minded
none
of
these
things
nay
all
these
were
abominable
to
him
for
good
books
they
might
lie
in
his
masters
house
till
they
rotted
for
him
he
would
not
regard
to
look
into
them
but
would
get
all
the
bad
and
abominable
books
that
he
could
as
beastly
romances
and
books
full
of
ribbauldry
even
such
as
immediately
tended
to
set
all
fleshly
lusts
on
fire
true
he
durst
not
be
known
to
have
any
of
these
to
his
master
therefore
would
he
never
let
them
be
seen
by
him
but
would
keep
them
in
close
places
and
peruse
them
at
such
times
as
yielded
him
fit
opportunities
thereto
for
good
instruction
he
liked
that
much
as
he
liked
good
books
his
care
was
to
hear
but
little
thereof
and
to
forget
what
he
heard
as
soon
as
twas
spoken
yea
i
have
heard
some
that
knew
him
then
say
that
one
might
evidently
discern
by
the
shew
of
his
countenance
and
gestures
that
good
counsel
was
to
him
like
even
a
continual
torment
to
him
nor
did
he
ever
count
himself
at
liberty
but
when
farthest
off
of
wholsom
words
he
would
hate
them
that
rebuked
him
and
count
them
his
deadly
enemies
for
good
example
which
was
frequently
set
him
by
his
master
both
in
religious
and
civil
matters
these
young
badman
would
laugh
at
and
would
also
make
a
byword
of
them
when
he
came
in
place
where
he
with
safety
could
his
master
indeed
would
make
him
go
with
him
to
sermons
and
that
where
he
thought
the
best
preachers
were
but
this
ungodly
young
man
what
shall
i
say
was
i
think
a
master
of
art
in
all
mischief
he
had
these
wicked
ways
to
hinder
himself
of
hearing
let
the
preacher
thunder
never
so
loud
his
way
was
when
come
into
the
place
of
hearing
to
sit
down
in
some
corner
and
then
to
fall
fast
asleep
or
else
to
fix
his
adulterous
eyes
upon
some
beautifull
object
that
was
in
the
place
and
so
all
therewith
be
feeding
of
his
fleshly
lusts
or
if
he
could
get
near
to
some
that
he
had
observed
would
fit
his
humour
he
would
be
whispering
gigling
and
playing
with
them
till
such
time
as
sermon
was
done
atten
why
he
was
grown
to
a
prodigious
height
of
wickedness
wise
he
was
so
and
that
which
aggravates
all
was
this
was
his
practice
as
soon
as
he
was
come
to
his
master
he
was
as
ready
at
all
these
things
as
if
he
had
before
he
came
to
his
master
served
an
apprentiship
to
learn
them
atten
there
could
not
but
be
added
as
you
relate
them
rebellion
to
his
sin
methinks
it
is
as
if
he
had
said
i
will
not
hear
i
will
not
regard
i
will
not
mind
good
i
will
not
mend
i
will
not
turn
i
will
not
be
converted
picture
take
note
symbol
wise
you
say
true
and
i
know
not
to
whom
more
fitly
to
compare
him
than
to
that
man
who
when
i
my
self
rebuked
him
for
his
wickedness
in
this
great
huff
replied
what
would
the
devil
do
for
company
if
it
was
not
for
such
as
atten
why
did
you
ever
hear
any
man
say
so
wise
yes
that
i
did
and
this
young
badman
was
as
like
him
as
an
egg
is
like
an
egg
alas
the
scripture
makes
mention
of
many
that
by
their
actions
speak
the
same
they
say
unto
god
depart
from
us
for
we
desire
not
the
knowledge
of
thy
ways
again
they
refuse
to
hearken
and
pull
away
their
shoulder
and
stop
their
ears
yea
they
make
their
hearts
hard
as
an
lest
they
should
hear
the
law
and
the
words
that
the
lord
of
host
s
hath
sent
what
are
all
these
but
such
as
badman
and
such
as
the
young
man
but
now
mentioned
that
young
man
was
my
when
i
was
solacing
my
self
in
my
sins
i
may
make
mention
of
him
to
my
shame
but
he
has
a
great
many
fellows
atten
young
badman
was
like
him
indeed
and
he
trod
his
steps
as
if
his
wickedness
had
been
his
very
copy
i
mean
as
to
his
desperateness
for
had
he
not
been
a
desperate
one
he
would
never
have
made
you
such
a
reply
when
you
was
rebuking
of
him
for
his
sin
but
when
did
you
give
him
such
a
rebuke
wise
a
while
after
god
had
parted
him
and
i
by
calling
of
me
as
i
hope
by
his
grace
still
leaving
him
in
his
sins
and
so
far
as
i
could
ever
gather
as
he
lived
so
he
died
even
as
badman
did
but
we
will
leave
him
and
return
again
to
our
discourse
atten
ha
poor
obstinate
sinners
doe
they
think
that
god
can
not
be
even
with
them
wise
i
do
not
know
what
they
think
but
i
know
that
god
hath
said
that
as
he
cried
and
they
would
not
hear
so
they
shall
crie
and
i
will
not
hear
saith
the
lord
doubtless
there
is
a
time
a
coming
when
badman
will
crie
for
this
atten
but
i
wonder
that
he
should
be
so
expert
in
wickedness
so
soon
alas
he
was
but
a
stripling
i
suppose
he
was
as
yet
not
twenty
wise
no
nor
eighteen
neither
but
as
with
ishmael
and
with
the
children
that
mocked
the
prophet
the
seeds
of
sin
did
put
forth
themselves
betimes
in
him
atten
well
he
was
as
wicked
a
young
man
as
commonly
one
shall
hear
of
wise
you
will
say
so
when
you
know
all
atten
all
i
think
here
is
a
great
all
but
if
there
is
more
behind
pray
let
us
hear
it
wise
why
then
i
will
tell
you
that
he
had
not
been
with
his
master
much
above
a
year
and
a
half
but
he
came
acquainted
with
three
young
villains
who
here
shall
be
nameless
that
taught
him
to
adde
to
his
sin
much
of
like
kind
and
he
as
aptly
received
their
instructions
one
of
them
was
chiefly
given
to
uncleanness
another
to
drunkenness
and
the
third
to
purloining
or
stealing
from
his
master
atten
alas
poor
wretch
he
was
bad
enough
before
but
these
i
suppose
made
him
much
worse
wise
that
they
made
him
worse
you
may
be
sure
of
for
they
taught
him
to
be
an
arch
a
chief
one
in
all
their
wayes
atten
it
was
an
ill
hap
that
he
ever
came
acqu
a
inted
with
them
wise
you
must
rather
word
it
thus
it
was
the
judgement
of
god
that
he
did
that
is
he
came
acquainted
with
them
through
the
anger
of
god
he
had
a
good
master
and
before
him
a
good
father
by
these
he
had
good
counsel
given
him
for
months
and
years
together
but
his
heart
was
set
upon
mischief
he
loved
wickedness
more
than
to
do
good
even
untill
his
iniquity
came
to
be
hateful
therefore
from
the
anger
of
god
it
was
that
these
companions
of
his
and
he
did
at
last
so
acquaint
together
sayes
paul
they
did
not
like
to
retain
god
in
their
knowledge
and
what
follows
wherefore
god
gave
them
over
or
up
to
their
own
hearts
lusts
and
again
as
for
such
as
turn
aside
to
their
own
crooked
wayes
the
lord
shall
lead
them
forth
with
the
workers
of
iniquity
this
therefore
was
gods
hand
upon
him
that
he
might
be
destroyed
be
damned
because
he
received
not
the
love
of
the
truth
that
he
might
be
saved
he
chose
his
delusions
and
deluders
for
him
even
the
company
of
base
men
of
fools
that
he
might
be
destroyed
atten
i
can
not
but
think
indeed
that
it
is
a
great
judgment
of
god
for
a
man
to
be
given
up
to
the
company
of
vile
men
for
what
are
such
but
the
devils
decoyes
even
those
by
whom
he
drawes
the
simple
into
the
net
a
whoremaster
a
drunkard
a
thiefe
what
are
they
but
the
devils
baits
by
which
he
catcheth
others
wise
you
say
right
but
this
young
badman
was
no
simple
one
if
by
simple
you
mean
one
uninstructed
for
he
had
often
good
counsel
given
him
but
if
by
simple
you
mean
him
that
is
a
fool
as
to
the
true
knowledge
of
and
faith
in
christ
then
he
was
a
simple
one
indeed
for
he
chose
death
rather
than
life
and
to
live
in
continual
opposition
to
god
rather
than
to
be
reconciled
unto
him
according
to
that
saying
of
the
wise
man
the
fooles
hated
knowledge
and
did
not
choose
the
fear
of
the
lord
and
what
judgement
more
dreadfull
can
a
fool
be
given
up
to
than
to
be
delivered
into
the
hands
of
such
men
that
have
skill
to
do
nothing
but
to
ripen
sin
and
hasten
its
finishing
unto
damnation
and
therefore
men
should
be
afraid
of
offending
god
because
he
can
in
this
manner
punish
them
for
their
sins
picture
take
note
symbol
i
knew
a
man
that
once
was
as
i
thought
hopefully
awakened
about
his
condition
yea
i
knew
two
that
were
so
awakened
but
in
time
they
began
to
draw
back
and
to
incline
again
to
their
lusts
wherefore
god
gave
them
up
to
the
company
of
three
or
four
men
that
in
less
than
three
years
time
brought
them
roundly
to
the
gallows
where
they
were
hanged
like
dogs
because
they
refused
to
live
like
honest
men
atten
but
such
men
do
not
believe
that
thus
to
be
given
up
of
god
is
in
judgement
and
anger
they
rather
take
it
to
be
their
liberty
and
do
count
it
their
happiness
they
are
glad
that
their
cord
is
loosed
and
that
the
reins
are
in
their
neck
they
are
glad
that
they
may
sin
without
controul
and
that
they
may
choose
such
company
as
can
make
them
more
expert
in
an
evil
way
wise
their
judgement
is
therefore
so
much
the
greater
because
thereto
is
added
blindness
of
mind
and
hardness
of
heart
in
a
wicked
way
they
are
turned
up
to
the
way
of
death
but
must
not
see
to
what
place
they
are
going
they
must
go
as
the
ox
to
the
slaughter
and
as
the
fool
to
the
correction
of
the
stocks
till
a
dart
strikes
through
their
liver
not
knowing
that
it
is
for
their
life
this
i
say
makes
their
judgement
double
they
are
given
up
of
god
for
a
while
to
sport
themselves
with
that
which
will
assuredly
make
them
mourn
at
last
when
their
flesh
and
their
body
is
consumed
these
are
those
that
peter
speaks
of
that
shall
utterly
perish
in
their
own
corruptions
these
i
say
who
count
it
pleasure
to
ryot
in
the
and
that
sport
themselves
with
their
own
deceivings
are
as
natural
bruit
beasts
made
to
be
taken
and
destroyed
atten
well
but
i
pray
now
concerning
these
three
villains
that
were
young
badmans
companions
tell
me
more
particularly
how
he
carried
it
then
wise
how
he
carried
it
why
he
did
as
they
i
intimated
so
much
before
when
i
said
they
made
him
an
arch
a
chief
one
in
their
ways
first
he
became
a
frequenter
of
taverns
and
and
would
stay
there
untill
he
was
even
as
drunk
as
a
beast
and
if
it
was
so
that
he
could
not
get
out
by
day
he
would
be
sure
get
out
by
night
yea
he
became
so
common
a
drunkard
at
last
that
he
was
taken
notice
of
to
be
a
drunkard
even
by
all
atten
this
was
swinish
for
drunkenness
is
so
beastly
a
sin
a
sin
so
much
against
nature
that
i
wonder
that
any
that
have
but
the
appearance
of
men
can
give
up
themselves
to
so
beastly
yea
worse
than
beastly
a
thing
wise
it
is
a
swinish
vanity
indeed
i
will
tell
you
another
story
picture
take
note
symbol
there
was
a
gentleman
that
had
a
drunkard
to
be
his
groom
and
coming
home
one
night
very
much
abused
with
beer
his
master
saw
it
well
quoth
his
master
within
himself
i
will
let
thee
alone
to
night
but
to
morrow
morning
i
will
convince
thee
that
thou
art
worse
than
a
beast
by
the
behaviour
of
my
horse
so
when
morning
was
come
he
bids
his
man
goe
and
water
his
horse
and
so
he
did
but
coming
up
to
his
master
he
commands
him
to
water
him
again
so
the
fellow
rid
into
the
water
the
second
time
but
his
masters
horse
would
now
drink
no
more
so
the
fellow
came
up
and
told
his
master
then
said
his
master
thou
drunken
sot
thou
art
far
worse
than
my
horse
he
will
drink
but
to
satisfie
nature
but
thou
wilt
drink
to
the
abuse
of
nature
he
will
drink
but
to
refresh
himself
but
thou
to
thy
hurt
and
dammage
he
will
drink
that
he
may
be
more
serviceable
to
his
master
but
thou
till
thou
art
uncapable
of
serving
either
god
or
man
o
thou
beast
how
much
art
thou
worse
than
the
horse
that
thou
ridest
on
atten
truly
i
think
that
his
master
served
him
right
for
in
doing
as
he
did
he
shewed
him
plainly
as
he
said
that
he
had
not
so
much
government
of
himself
as
his
horse
had
of
himself
and
consequently
that
his
beast
did
live
more
according
to
the
law
of
his
nature
by
far
than
did
his
man
but
pray
go
on
with
what
you
have
further
to
say
wise
why
i
say
that
there
are
four
things
which
if
they
were
well
considered
would
make
drunkenness
to
be
abhorred
in
the
thoughts
of
the
children
of
men
it
greatly
tendeth
to
impoverish
and
beggar
a
man
the
drunkard
says
solomon
shall
come
to
poverty
many
that
have
begun
the
world
with
plenty
have
gone
out
of
it
in
rags
through
drunkenness
yea
many
children
that
have
been
born
to
good
estates
have
yet
been
brought
to
a
flail
a
rake
through
this
beastly
sin
of
their
parents
this
sin
of
drunkenness
it
bringeth
upon
the
body
many
great
and
incurable
diseases
by
which
men
do
in
little
time
come
to
their
end
and
none
can
help
them
so
because
they
are
overmuch
wicked
therefore
they
dye
before
their
time
drunkenness
is
a
sin
that
is
often
times
attended
with
abundance
of
other
evils
who
hath
woe
who
hath
sorrow
who
hath
contention
who
hath
babblings
who
hath
wounds
without
cause
who
hath
redness
of
the
eyes
they
that
tarry
long
at
the
wine
they
that
go
to
seek
mixt
wine
that
is
the
drunkard
by
drunkenness
men
do
often
times
shorten
their
dayes
goe
out
of
the
drunk
and
break
their
necks
before
they
come
home
instances
not
a
few
might
be
given
of
this
but
this
is
so
manifest
a
man
need
say
nothing
atten
but
that
which
is
worse
than
all
is
it
also
prepares
men
for
everlasting
burnings
wise
yea
and
it
so
stupifies
and
besotts
the
soul
that
a
man
that
is
far
gone
in
drunkenness
is
hardly
ever
recovered
to
god
tell
me
when
did
you
see
an
old
drunkard
converted
no
no
such
an
one
will
sleep
till
he
dies
though
he
sleeps
on
the
top
of
a
mast
let
his
dangers
be
never
so
great
and
death
and
damnation
never
so
near
he
will
not
be
awaked
out
of
his
sleep
so
that
if
a
man
have
any
respect
either
to
credit
health
life
or
salvation
he
will
not
be
a
drunken
man
but
the
truth
is
where
this
sin
gets
the
upper
hand
men
are
as
i
said
before
so
intoxicated
and
bewitched
with
the
seeming
pleasures
and
sweetness
thereof
that
they
have
neither
heart
nor
mind
to
think
of
that
which
is
better
in
itself
and
would
if
imbraced
do
them
good
atten
you
said
that
drunkenness
tends
to
poverty
yet
some
make
themselves
rich
by
drunken
bargains
wise
i
said
so
because
the
word
says
so
and
as
to
some
mens
getting
thereby
that
is
indeed
but
rare
and
base
yea
and
base
will
be
the
end
of
such
gettings
the
word
of
god
is
against
such
wayes
and
the
curse
of
god
will
be
the
end
of
such
doings
an
inheritance
may
sometimes
thus
be
hastily
gotten
at
the
beginning
but
the
end
thereof
shall
not
be
blessed
hark
what
the
prophet
saith
wo
to
him
that
coveteth
an
evil
covetousness
that
he
may
set
his
nest
on
high
whether
he
makes
drunkenness
or
ought
else
the
engine
and
decoy
to
get
it
for
that
man
doth
but
consult
the
shame
of
his
own
house
the
spoiling
of
his
family
and
the
damnation
of
his
soul
for
that
which
he
getteth
by
working
of
iniquity
is
but
a
getting
by
the
devices
of
hell
therefore
he
can
be
no
gainer
neither
for
himself
or
family
that
gains
by
an
evil
course
but
this
was
one
of
the
sins
that
badman
was
addicted
to
after
he
came
acquainted
with
these
three
fellows
nor
could
all
that
his
master
could
do
break
him
of
this
beastly
sin
atten
but
where
since
he
was
but
an
apprentice
could
he
get
money
to
follow
this
practice
for
drunkenness
as
you
have
intimated
is
a
very
costly
sin
wise
his
master
paid
for
all
for
as
i
told
you
before
as
he
learned
of
these
three
villains
to
be
a
beastly
drunkard
so
he
learned
of
them
to
pilfer
and
steal
from
his
master
sometimes
he
would
sell
off
his
masters
goods
but
keep
the
money
that
is
when
he
could
also
sometimes
he
would
beguile
his
master
by
taking
out
of
his
cashbox
and
when
he
could
do
neither
of
these
he
would
convey
away
of
his
masters
wares
what
he
thought
would
be
least
missed
and
send
or
carry
them
to
such
and
such
houses
where
he
knew
they
would
be
laid
up
to
his
use
and
then
appoint
set
times
there
to
meet
and
make
merry
with
these
fellowes
atten
this
was
as
bad
nay
i
think
worse
than
the
former
for
by
thus
doing
he
did
not
only
run
himself
under
the
wrath
of
god
but
has
endangered
the
undoing
of
his
master
and
his
familie
wise
sins
go
not
alone
but
follow
one
the
other
as
do
the
links
of
a
chain
he
that
will
be
a
drunkard
must
have
money
either
of
his
own
or
of
some
other
mans
either
of
his
fathers
mothers
masters
or
at
the
or
some
way
atten
i
fear
that
many
an
honest
man
is
undone
by
such
kind
of
servants
wise
i
am
of
the
same
mind
with
you
but
this
should
make
the
dealer
the
more
wary
what
kind
of
servants
he
keeps
and
what
kind
of
apprentices
he
takes
it
should
also
teach
him
to
look
well
to
his
shop
himself
also
to
take
strict
account
of
all
things
that
are
bought
and
sold
by
his
servants
the
masters
neglect
herein
may
embolden
his
servant
to
be
bad
and
may
bring
him
too
in
short
time
to
rags
and
a
morsel
of
bread
atten
i
am
afraid
that
there
is
much
of
this
kind
of
pilfering
among
servants
in
these
bad
dayes
of
ours
wise
now
while
it
is
in
my
mind
i
will
tell
you
a
story
picture
take
note
symbol
when
i
was
in
prison
there
came
a
woman
to
me
that
was
under
a
great
deal
of
trouble
so
i
asked
her
she
being
a
stranger
to
me
what
she
had
to
say
to
me
she
said
she
was
afraid
she
should
be
damned
i
asked
her
the
cause
of
those
fears
she
told
me
that
she
had
sometime
since
lived
with
a
at
wellingborough
and
had
robbed
his
box
in
the
shop
several
times
of
money
to
the
value
of
more
than
now
i
will
say
and
pray
says
she
tell
me
what
i
shall
do
i
told
her
i
would
have
her
go
to
her
master
and
make
him
satisfaction
she
said
she
was
afraid
i
asked
her
why
she
said
she
doubted
he
would
hang
her
i
told
her
that
i
would
intercede
for
her
life
and
would
make
use
of
other
friends
too
to
do
the
like
but
she
told
me
she
durst
not
venture
that
well
said
i
shall
i
send
to
your
master
while
you
abide
out
of
sight
and
make
your
peace
with
him
before
he
sees
you
and
with
that
i
asked
her
her
masters
name
but
all
that
she
said
in
answer
to
this
was
pray
let
it
alone
till
i
come
to
you
again
so
away
she
went
and
neither
told
me
her
masters
name
nor
her
own
this
is
about
ten
or
twelve
years
since
and
i
never
saw
her
again
i
tell
you
this
story
for
this
cause
to
confirm
your
fears
that
such
kind
of
servants
too
many
there
be
and
that
god
makes
them
sometimes
like
old
tod
of
whom
mention
was
made
before
through
the
terrors
that
he
layes
upon
them
to
betray
themselves
picture
take
note
symbol
i
could
tell
you
of
another
that
came
to
me
with
a
like
relation
concerning
her
self
and
the
robbing
of
her
mistress
but
at
this
time
let
this
suffice
atten
but
what
was
that
other
villain
addicted
to
i
mean
young
badmans
third
companion
wise
uncleanness
i
told
you
before
but
it
seems
you
forgot
atten
right
it
was
uncleanness
uncleanness
is
also
a
filthy
sin
wise
it
is
so
and
yet
it
is
one
of
the
most
reigning
sins
in
our
day
atten
so
they
say
and
that
too
among
those
that
one
would
think
had
more
wit
even
among
the
great
ones
wise
the
more
is
the
pity
for
usually
examples
that
are
set
by
them
that
are
great
and
chief
spread
sooner
and
more
universally
then
do
the
sins
of
other
men
yea
and
when
such
men
are
at
the
head
in
transgressing
sin
walks
with
a
bold
face
through
the
land
as
jeremiah
saith
of
the
prophets
so
may
it
be
said
of
such
from
them
is
profaneness
gone
forth
into
all
the
land
that
is
with
bold
and
audacious
face
jer
atten
but
pray
let
us
return
again
to
badman
and
his
companions
you
say
one
of
them
was
very
vile
in
the
commission
of
uncleanness
wise
yes
so
i
say
not
but
that
he
was
a
drunkard
and
also
thievish
but
he
was
most
arch
in
this
sin
of
uncleanness
this
roguery
was
his
for
he
was
a
ringleader
to
them
all
in
the
beastly
sin
of
whoredom
he
was
also
best
acquainted
with
such
houses
where
they
were
and
so
could
readily
lead
the
rest
of
his
gang
unto
them
the
strumpets
also
because
they
knew
this
young
villain
would
at
first
discover
themselves
in
all
their
whorish
pranks
to
those
that
he
brought
with
him
atten
that
is
a
deadly
thing
i
mean
it
is
a
deadly
thing
to
young
men
when
such
beastly
queans
shall
with
words
and
carriages
that
are
openly
tempting
discover
themselves
unto
them
it
is
hard
for
such
to
escape
their
snare
wise
that
is
true
therefore
the
wise
mans
counsel
is
the
best
come
not
near
the
door
of
her
house
for
they
are
as
you
say
very
tempting
as
is
seen
by
her
in
the
proverbs
i
looked
says
the
wise
man
through
my
casement
and
beheld
among
the
simple
ones
i
discerned
a
young
man
void
of
understanding
passing
through
the
streets
near
her
corner
and
he
went
the
way
to
her
house
in
the
twilight
in
the
evening
in
the
black
and
dark
night
and
behold
there
met
him
a
woman
with
the
attire
of
an
harlot
and
subtle
of
heart
she
is
loud
and
stubborn
her
feet
abide
not
in
her
house
now
she
is
without
now
she
is
in
the
street
and
lieth
in
wait
at
every
corner
so
she
caught
him
and
kiss
d
him
and
with
an
impudent
face
said
unto
him
i
have
peace
offerings
with
me
this
day
have
i
payed
my
vows
therefore
came
i
forth
to
meet
thee
diligently
to
seek
thy
face
and
i
have
found
thee
i
have
decked
my
bed
with
coverings
of
tapestry
with
carved
works
with
fine
linnen
of
ægypt
i
have
perfumed
my
bed
with
myrrhe
aloes
and
cinnamon
come
let
us
take
our
fill
of
love
untill
the
morning
let
us
solace
our
selves
with
loves
here
was
a
bold
beast
and
indeed
the
very
eyes
hands
words
and
ways
of
such
are
all
snares
and
bands
to
youthful
lustful
fellows
and
with
these
was
young
badman
greatly
snared
atten
this
sin
of
uncleanness
is
mightily
cried
out
against
both
by
moses
the
prophets
christ
and
his
apostles
and
yet
as
we
see
for
all
that
how
men
run
to
it
wise
you
have
said
the
truth
and
i
will
adde
that
god
to
hold
men
back
from
so
filthy
a
sin
has
set
such
a
stamp
of
his
indignation
upon
it
and
commanded
such
evil
effects
to
follow
it
that
were
not
they
that
use
it
bereft
of
all
fear
of
god
and
love
to
their
own
health
they
could
not
but
stop
and
be
afraid
to
commit
it
for
besides
the
eternal
damnation
that
doth
attend
such
in
the
next
world
for
these
have
no
inheritance
in
the
kingdom
of
christ
and
of
god
ephes
the
evil
effects
thereof
in
this
world
are
dreadfull
atten
pray
skew
me
some
of
them
that
as
occasion
offereth
it
self
i
may
shew
them
to
others
for
their
good
wise
so
i
will
it
bringeth
a
man
as
was
said
of
the
sin
before
to
want
and
poverty
for
by
means
of
a
whorish
woman
a
man
is
brought
to
a
piece
of
bread
the
reason
is
for
that
an
whore
will
not
yield
without
hire
and
men
when
the
devil
and
lust
is
in
them
and
god
and
his
fear
far
away
from
them
will
not
stick
so
they
may
accomplish
their
desire
to
lay
their
signet
their
bracelets
and
their
staff
to
pledge
rather
than
miss
of
the
fulfilling
of
their
lusts
again
by
this
sin
men
diminish
their
strength
and
bring
upon
themselves
even
upon
the
body
a
multitude
of
diseases
this
king
lemuel
s
mother
warned
him
of
what
my
son
said
she
and
what
the
son
of
my
womb
and
what
the
son
of
my
vows
give
not
thy
strength
unto
women
nor
thy
ways
to
that
which
destroyeth
kings
this
sin
is
destructive
to
the
body
give
me
leave
to
tell
you
another
story

take
note

i
have
heard
of
a
great
man
that
was
a
very
unclean
person
and
he
had
lived
so
long
in
that
sin
that
he
had
almost
lost
his
sight
so
his
physicians
were
sent
for
to
whom
he
told
his
to
disease
but
they
told
him
that
they
could
do
him
no
good
unless
he
would
forbear
his
women
nay
then
said
he
farewell
sweet
sight
whence
observe
that
this
sin
as
i
said
is
destructive
to
the
body
and
also
that
some
men
be
so
in
love
therewith
that
they
will
have
it
though
it
destroy
their
body
atten
paul
says
also
that
he
that
sins
this
sin
sins
against
his
own
body
but
what
of
that
he
that
will
run
the
hazard
of
eternal
damnation
of
his
soul
but
he
will
commit
this
sin
will
for
it
run
the
hazard
of
destroying
his
body
if
young
badman
feared
not
the
damnation
of
his
soul
do
you
think
that
the
consideration
of
impairing
of
his
body
would
have
deterred
him
therefrom
wise
you
say
true
but
yet
methinks
there
are
still
such
bad
effects
follow
often
upon
the
commission
of
it
that
if
men
would
consider
them
it
would
put
at
least
a
stop
to
their
career
therein
atten
what
other
evil
effects
attend
this
sin
wise
outward
shame
and
disgrace
and
that
in
these
particulars
first
there
often
follows
this
foul
sin
the
foul
disease
now
called
by
us
the
pox
a
disease
so
nauseous
and
stinking
so
infectious
to
the
whole
body
and
so
intailed
to
this
sin
that
hardly
are
any
common
with
unclean
women
but
they
have
more
or
less
a
touch
of
it
to
their
shame
atten
that
is
a
foul
disease
indeed
picture
take
note
symbol
i
knew
a
man
once
that
rotted
away
with
it
and
another
that
had
his
nose
eaten
off
and
his
mouth
almost
quite
sewed
up
thereby
wise
it
is
a
disease
that
where
it
is
it
commonly
declares
that
the
cause
thereof
is
uncleanness
it
declares
to
all
that
behold
such
a
man
that
he
is
an
odious
a
beastly
unclean
person
this
is
that
strange
punishment
that
job
speaks
of
that
is
appointed
to
seize
on
these
workers
of
iniquity
atten
then
it
seems
you
think
that
the
strange
punishment
that
job
there
speaks
of
should
be
the
foul
disease
wise
i
have
thought
so
indeed
and
that
for
this
reason
we
see
that
this
disease
is
entailed
as
i
may
say
to
this
most
beastly
sin
nor
is
there
any
disease
so
entailed
to
any
other
sin
as
this
to
this
that
this
is
the
sin
to
which
the
strange
punishment
is
entailed
you
will
easily
perceive
when
you
read
the
text
i
made
a
covenant
with
mine
eyes
said
job
why
should
i
think
upon
a
maid
for
what
portion
is
there
for
that
sin
from
above
and
what
inheritance
of
the
almighty
from
on
high
and
then
he
answers
himself
is
not
destruction
to
the
wicked
and
a
strange
punishment
to
the
workers
of
iniquity
this
strange
punishment
is
the
pox
also
i
think
that
this
foul
disease
is
that
which
solomon
intends
when
he
saith
speaking
of
this
unclean
and
beastly
creature
a
wound
and
dishonour
shall
he
get
and
his
reproach
shall
not
be
turned
away
a
punishment
job
calls
it
a
wound
and
dishonour
solomon
calls
it
and
they
both
do
set
it
as
a
remark
upon
this
sin
job
calling
it
a
strange
punishment
and
solomon
a
reproach
that
shall
not
be
turned
away
from
them
that
are
common
in
it
atten
what
other
things
follow
upon
the
commission
of
this
beastly
sin
wise
why
it
is
attended
with
murder
with
the
murder
of
the
babe
begotten
on
the
defiled
bed
how
common
it
is
for
the
and
to
consent
together
to
murder
their
children
will
be
better
known
at
the
day
of
judgement
yet
something
is
manifest
now
i
will
tell
you
another
story
picture
take
note
symbol
an
ancient
man
one
of
mine
acquaintance
a
man
of
good
credit
in
our
countrey
had
a
mother
that
was
a
midwife
who
was
mostly
imployed
in
laying
great
persons
to
this
womans
house
upon
a
time
comes
a
brave
young
gallant
on
horseback
to
fetch
her
to
lay
a
young
lady
so
she
addresses
herself
to
go
with
him
wherefore
he
takes
her
up
behind
him
and
away
they
ride
in
the
night
now
they
had
not
rid
far
but
the
gentleman
litt
off
his
horse
and
taking
the
old
midwife
in
his
arms
from
the
horse
turned
round
with
her
several
times
and
then
set
her
up
again
then
he
got
up
and
away
they
went
till
they
came
at
a
stately
house
into
which
he
had
her
and
so
into
a
chamber
where
the
young
lady
was
in
her
pains
he
then
bid
the
midwife
do
her
office
and
she
demanded
help
but
he
drew
out
his
sword
and
told
her
if
she
did
not
make
speed
to
do
her
office
without
she
must
look
for
nothing
but
death
well
to
be
short
this
old
midwife
laid
the
young
lady
and
a
fine
sweet
babe
she
had
now
there
was
made
in
a
room
hard
by
a
very
great
fire
so
the
gentleman
took
up
the
babe
went
and
drew
the
coals
from
the
stock
cast
the
child
in
and
covered
it
up
and
there
was
an
end
of
that
so
when
the
midwife
had
done
her
work
he
paid
her
well
for
her
pains
but
shut
her
up
in
a
dark
room
all
day
and
when
night
came
took
her
up
behind
him
again
and
carried
her
away
till
she
came
almost
at
home
then
he
turned
her
round
and
round
as
he
did
before
and
had
her
to
her
house
set
her
down
bid
her
farewell
and
away
he
went
and
she
could
never
tell
who
it
was
this
story
the
midwifes
son
who
was
a
minister
told
me
and
also
protested
that
his
mother
told
it
him
for
a
truth
atten
murder
doth
often
follow
indeed
as
that
which
is
the
fruit
of
this
sin
but
sometimes
god
brings
even
these
adulterers
and
adulteresses
to
shameful
ends
picture
take
note
symbol
i
heard
of
one
i
think
a
doctor
of
physick
and
his
whore
who
had
had
three
or
four
bastards
betwixt
them
and
had
murdered
them
all
but
at
last
themselves
were
hanged
for
it
in
or
near
to
colchester
it
came
out
after
this
manner
the
whore
was
so
afflicted
in
her
conscience
abort
it
that
she
could
not
be
quiet
untill
she
had
made
it
known
thus
god
many
times
makes
the
actors
of
wickedness
their
own
accusers
and
brings
them
by
their
own
tongues
to
condigne
punishment
for
their
own
sins
wise
there
has
been
many
such
instances
but
we
will
let
that
pass
i
was
once
in
the
presence
of
a
woman
a
married
woman
that
lay
sick
of
the
sickness
whereof
she
died
and
being
smitten
in
her
conscience
for
the
sin
of
uncleanness
which
she
had
often
committed
with
other
men
picture
take
note
symbol
i
heard
her
as
she
lay
upon
her
bed
cry
out
thus
i
am
a
whore
and
all
my
children
are
bastards
and
i
must
go
to
hell
for
my
sin
and
look
there
stands
the
devil
at
my
beds
feet
to
receive
my
soul
when
i
die
atten
these
are
sad
storyes
tell
no
more
of
them
now
but
if
you
please
shew
me
yet
some
other
of
the
evil
effects
of
this
beastly
sin
wise
this
sin
is
such
a
snare
to
the
soul
that
unless
a
miracle
of
grace
prevents
it
unavoidably
perishes
in
the
enchanting
and
bewitching
pleasures
of
it
this
is
manifest
by
these
and
such
like
texts
the
adulteress
will
hunt
for
the
precious
life
whoso
committeth
adultery
with
a
woman
lacketh
understanding
and
he
that
doth
it
destroys
his
own
soul
an
whore
is
a
deep
ditch
and
a
strange
woman
is
a
narrow
pit
her
house
inclines
to
death
and
her
pathes
unto
the
dead
none
that
go
in
unto
her
return
again
neither
take
they
hold
of
the
path
of
life
she
hath
cast
down
many
wounded
yea
many
strong
men
have
been
slain
by
her
her
house
is
the
way
to
hell
going
down
to
the
chambers
of
death
atten
these
are
dreadful
sayings
and
do
shew
the
dreadful
state
of
those
that
are
guilty
of
this
sin
wise
verily
so
they
doe
but
yet
that
which
makes
the
whole
more
dreadful
is
that
men
are
given
up
to
this
sin
because
they
are
abhorred
of
god
and
because
abhorred
therefore
they
shall
fall
into
the
commission
of
it
and
shall
live
there
the
mouth
that
is
the
flattering
lips
of
a
strange
woman
is
a
deep
pit
the
abhorred
of
the
lord
shall
fall
therein
therefore
it
saith
again
of
such
that
they
have
none
inheritance
in
the
kingdom
of
christ
and
of
god
atten
put
all
together
and
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
to
live
and
die
in
this
transgression
wise
true
but
suppose
that
instead
of
all
these
judgments
this
sin
had
attending
of
it
all
the
felicities
of
this
life
and
no
bitterness
shame
or
disgrace
mixed
with
it
yet
one
hour
in
hell
will
spoil
all
o
this
hell
damnation
in
hell
it
is
such
an
inconceivable
punishment
that
were
it
but
throughly
believed
it
would
nip
this
sin
with
others
in
the
head
but
here
is
the
mischief
those
that
give
up
themselves
to
these
things
do
so
harden
themselves
in
unbelief
and
atheism
about
the
things
the
punishments
that
god
hath
threatned
to
inflict
upon
the
committers
of
them
that
at
last
they
arrive
to
almost
an
absolute
and
firm
belief
that
there
is
no
judgment
to
come
hereafter
else
they
would
not
they
could
not
no
not
attempt
to
commit
this
sin
by
such
abominable
language
as
some
do
picture
take
note
symbol
i
heard
of
one
that
should
say
to
his
miss
when
he
tempted
her
to
the
committing
of
this
sin
if
thou
wilt
venture
thy
body
i
will
venture
my
soul
and
i
my
self
heard
another
say
when
he
was
tempting
of
a
maid
to
commit
uncleanness
with
him
it
was
in
olivers
dayes
that
if
she
did
prove
with
child
he
would
tell
her
how
she
might
escape
punishment
and
that
was
then
somewhat
severe
say
saith
he
when
you
come
before
the
judge
that
you
are
with
child
by
the
holy
ghost
picture
take
note
symbol
i
heard
him
say
thus
and
it
greatly
afflicted
me
i
had
a
mind
to
have
accused
him
for
it
before
some
magistrate
but
he
was
a
great
man
and
i
was
poor
and
young
so
i
let
it
alone
but
it
troubled
me
very
much
atten
twas
the
most
horrible
thing
that
ever
i
heard
in
my
life
but
how
far
off
are
these
men
from
that
spirit
and
grace
that
dwelt
in
joseph
wise
right
when
joseph
s
mistress
tempted
him
yea
tempted
him
daily
yea
she
laid
hold
on
him
and
said
with
her
whores
forehead
come
lie
with
me
but
he
refused
he
hearkned
not
to
lie
with
her
or
to
be
with
her
badman
would
have
taken
the
opportunity
and
a
little
to
comment
upon
this
of
joseph
here
is
a
miss
a
great
miss
the
wife
of
the
captain
of
the
guard
some
beautiful
dame
i
le
warrant
you
here
is
a
miss
won
and
in
her
whorish
affections
come
over
to
joseph
without
his
speaking
of
a
word
here
is
her
unclean
desire
made
known
come
lie
with
me
said
she
here
was
a
fit
opportunity
there
was
none
of
the
men
of
the
house
there
within
joseph
was
a
young
man
full
of
strength
and
therefore
the
more
in
danger
to
be
taken
this
was
to
him
a
temptation
from
her
that
lasted
days
and
yet
joseph
refused
her
daily
temptation
her
daily
solicitation
her
daily
provocation
heartily
violently
and
constantly
for
when
she
caught
him
by
the
garment
saying
lie
with
me
he
left
his
garment
in
her
hand
and
gat
him
out
ay
and
although
contempt
treachery
slander
accusation
imprisonment
and
danger
of
death
followed
for
an
whore
careth
not
what
mischief
she
does
when
she
can
not
have
her
end
yet
joseph
will
not
defile
himself
sin
against
god
and
hazard
his
own
eternal
salvation
atten
blessed
joseph
i
would
thou
hadst
more
fellows
wise
badman
has
more
fellows
than
joseph
else
there
would
not
be
so
many
whores
as
there
are
for
though
i
doubt
not
but
that
that
sex
is
bad
enough
this
way
yet
i
verify
believe
that
many
of
them
are
made
whores
at
first
by
the
flatteries
of
badmans
fellows
alas
there
is
many
a
woman
plunged
into
this
sin
at
first
even
by
promises
of
marriage
i
say
by
these
promises
they
are
flattered
yea
forced
into
a
consenting
to
these
villanies
and
so
being
in
and
growing
hardened
in
their
hearts
they
at
last
give
themselves
up
even
as
wicked
men
do
to
act
this
kind
of
wickedness
with
greediness
but
joseph
you
see
was
of
another
mind
for
the
fear
of
god
was
in
him
i
will
before
i
leave
this
tell
you
here
two
notable
storyes
and
i
wish
badmans
companions
may
hear
of
them
they
are
found
in
clarks
for
sinners
and
are
these
cleaver
says
clark
reports
of
one
whom
he
knew
that
had
committed
the
act
of
uncleanness
whereupon
he
fell
into
such
horror
of
conscience
that
he
hanged
himself
leaving
it
thus
written
in
a
paper
indeed
saith
he
i
acknowledge
it
to
be
utterly
unlawful
for
a
man
to
kill
himself
but
i
am
bound
to
act
the
magistrates
part
because
the
punishment
of
this
sin
is
death
clark
doth
also
in
the
same
page
make
mention
of
two
more
who
as
they
were
committing
adultery
in
london
were
immediately
struck
dead
with
fire
from
heaven
in
the
very
act
their
bodyes
were
so
found
half
burnt
up
and
sending
out
a
most
loathsom
savour
atten
these
are
notable
storyes
indeed
wise
so
they
are
and
i
suppose
they
are
as
true
as
notable
atten
well
but
i
wonder
if
young
badmans
master
knew
him
to
be
such
a
wretch
that
he
would
suffer
him
in
his
house
wise
they
liked
one
another
even
as
fire
and
water
doe
young
badmans
wayes
were
odious
to
his
master
and
his
masters
wayes
were
such
as
young
badman
could
not
endure
thus
in
these
two
was
fulfilled
that
saying
of
the
holy
ghost
an
unjust
man
is
an
abomination
to
the
just
and
he
that
is
upright
in
the
way
is
abomination
to
the
wicked
the
good
mans
wayes
badman
could
not
abide
nor
could
the
good
man
abide
the
bad
wayes
of
his
base
apprentice
yet
would
his
master
if
he
could
have
kept
him
and
also
have
learnt
him
his
trade
atten
if
he
could
why
he
might
if
he
would
might
he
not
wise
alas
badman
ran
away
from
him
once
and
twice
and
would
not
at
all
be
ruled
so
the
next
time
he
did
run
away
from
him
he
did
let
him
go
indeed
for
he
gave
him
no
occasion
to
run
away
except
it
was
by
holding
of
him
as
much
as
he
could
and
that
he
could
do
but
little
to
good
and
honest
rules
of
life
and
had
it
been
ones
own
case
one
should
have
let
him
go
for
what
should
a
man
do
that
had
either
regard
to
his
own
peace
his
childrens
good
or
the
preservation
of
the
rest
of
his
servants
from
evil
but
let
him
go
had
he
staid
the
house
of
correction
had
been
most
fit
for
him
but
thither
his
master
was
loth
to
send
him
because
of
the
love
that
he
bore
to
his
father
an
house
of
correction
i
say
had
been
the
fittest
place
for
him
but
his
master
let
him
go
atten
he
ran
away
you
say
but
whither
did
he
run
wise
why
to
one
of
his
own
trade
and
also
like
himself
thus
the
wicked
joyned
hand
in
hand
and
there
he
served
out
his
time
atten
then
sure
he
had
his
hearts
desire
when
he
was
with
one
so
like
himself
wise
yes
so
he
had
but
god
gave
it
him
in
his
anger
atten
how
do
you
mean
wise
i
mean
as
before
that
for
a
wicked
man
to
be
by
the
providence
of
god
turned
out
of
a
good
mans
doors
into
a
wicked
mans
house
to
dwell
is
a
sign
of
the
anger
of
god
for
god
by
this
and
such
judgements
says
thus
to
such
an
one
thou
wicked
one
thou
lovest
not
me
my
wayes
nor
my
people
thou
castest
my
law
and
good
counsel
behinde
thy
back
come
i
will
dispose
of
thee
in
my
wrath
thou
shalt
be
turned
over
to
the
ungodly
thou
shalt
be
put
to
school
to
the
devil
i
will
leave
thee
to
sink
and
swim
in
sin
till
i
shall
visit
thee
with
death
and
judgment
this
was
therefore
another
judgment
that
did
come
upon
this
young
badman
atten
you
have
said
the
truth
for
god
by
such
a
judgment
as
this
in
effect
says
so
indeed
for
he
takes
them
out
of
the
hand
of
the
just
and
binds
them
up
in
the
hand
of
the
wicked
and
whither
they
then
shall
be
carried
a
man
may
easily
imagin
wise
it
is
one
of
the
saddest
tokens
of
gods
anger
that
happens
to
such
kind
of
persons
and
that
for
several
reasons
such
an
one
by
this
judgment
is
put
out
out
of
the
way
and
from
under
the
means
which
ordinarily
are
made
use
of
to
do
good
to
the
soul
for
a
family
where
godliness
is
professed
and
practised
is
gods
ordinance
the
place
which
he
has
appointed
to
teach
young
ones
the
way
and
fear
of
god
now
to
be
put
out
of
such
a
family
into
a
bad
a
wicked
one
as
badman
was
must
needs
be
in
judgment
and
a
sign
of
the
anger
of
god
for
in
ungodly
families
men
learn
to
forget
god
to
hate
goodness
and
to
estrange
themselves
from
the
wayes
of
those
that
are
good
in
bad
families
they
have
continually
fresh
examples
and
also
incitements
to
evil
and
fresh
encouragements
to
it
too
yea
moreover
in
such
places
evil
is
commended
praised
of
and
they
that
do
it
are
applauded
and
this
to
be
sure
is
a
drowning
judgement
such
places
are
the
very
haunts
and
walks
of
the
infernal
spirits
who
are
continually
poysoning
the
cogitations
and
minds
of
one
or
other
in
such
families
that
they
may
be
able
to
poyson
others
therefore
observe
it
usually
in
wicked
families
some
one
or
two
are
more
arch
for
wickedness
then
are
any
other
that
are
there
now
such
are
satans
for
by
them
he
conveighs
of
the
spawn
of
hell
through
their
being
crafty
in
wickedness
into
the
ears
and
souls
of
their
companions
yea
and
when
they
have
once
conceived
wickedness
they
travel
with
it
as
doth
a
woman
with
child
till
they
have
brought
it
forth
behold
he
travelleth
with
iniquity
and
hath
conceived
mischief
and
brought
forth
falshood
some
men
as
here
is
intimated
in
the
text
and
as
was
hinted
also
before
have
a
kind
of
mystical
but
hellish
copulation
with
the
devil
who
is
the
father
and
their
soul
the
mother
of
sin
and
wickedness
and
they
so
soon
as
they
have
conceived
by
him
finish
by
bringing
forth
sin
both
it
and
their
own
damnation
atten
how
much
then
doth
it
concern
those
parents
that
love
their
children
to
see
that
if
they
go
from
them
they
be
put
into
such
families
as
be
good
that
they
may
learn
there
betimes
to
eschew
evil
and
to
follow
that
which
is
good
wise
it
doth
concern
them
indeed
and
it
doth
also
concern
them
that
take
children
into
their
families
to
take
heed
what
children
they
receive
for
a
man
may
soon
by
a
bad
boy
be
dammaged
both
in
his
name
estate
and
family
and
also
hindred
in
his
peace
and
peaceable
pursuit
after
god
and
godliness
i
say
by
one
such
vermin
as
a
wicked
and
filthy
apprentice
atten
true
for
one
sinner
destroyeth
much
good
and
a
poor
man
is
better
than
a
lier
but
many
times
a
man
can
not
help
it
for
such
as
at
the
beginning
promise
very
fair
are
by
a
little
time
proved
to
be
very
rogues
like
young
badman
wise
that
is
true
also
but
when
a
man
has
done
the
best
he
can
to
help
it
he
may
with
the
more
confidence
expect
the
blessing
of
god
to
follow
or
he
shall
have
the
more
peace
if
things
go
contrary
to
his
desire
atten
well
but
did
badman
and
his
master
agree
so
well
i
mean
his
last
master
since
they
were
birds
of
a
feather
i
mean
since
they
were
so
well
met
for
wickedness
wise
this
second
master
was
as
before
i
told
you
bad
enough
but
yet
he
would
often
fall
out
with
young
badman
his
servant
and
chide
yea
and
some
times
beat
him
too
for
his
naughty
doings
atten
what
for
all
he
was
so
bad
himself
this
is
like
the
proverb
the
devil
corrects
vice
wise
i
will
assure
you
tis
as
i
say
for
you
must
know
that
badmans
wayes
suited
not
with
his
masters
gains
could
he
have
done
as
the
damsel
that
we
read
of
acts
did
to
wit
fill
his
masters
purse
with
his
badness
he
had
certainly
been
his
but
it
was
not
so
with
young
badman
and
therefore
though
his
master
and
he
did
suit
well
enough
in
the
main
yet
in
this
and
that
point
they
differed
young
badman
was
for
neglecting
of
his
masters
business
for
going
to
the
for
beguiling
of
his
master
for
attempting
to
debauch
his
daughters
and
the
like
no
marvel
then
if
they
disagreed
in
these
points
not
so
much
for
that
his
master
had
an
antipathy
against
the
fact
it
self
for
he
could
do
so
when
he
was
an
apprentice
but
for
that
his
servant
by
his
sin
made
spoil
of
his
commodities
and
so
damnified
his
master
had
as
i
said
before
young
badmans
wickedness
had
only
a
tendency
to
his
masters
advantage
as
could
he
have
sworn
lied
cousened
cheated
and
defrauded
customers
for
his
master
and
indeed
sometimes
he
did
so
but
had
that
been
all
that
he
had
done
he
had
not
had
no
not
a
wry
word
from
his
master
but
this
was
not
always
badmans
way
atten
that
was
well
brought
in
even
the
maid
that
we
read
of
in
the
acts
and
the
distinction
was
as
clear
betwixt
the
wickedness
and
wickedness
of
servants
wise
alas
men
that
are
wicked
themselves
yet
greatly
hate
it
in
others
not
simply
because
it
is
wickedness
but
because
it
opposeth
their
interest
do
you
think
that
that
maids
master
would
have
been
troubled
at
the
loss
of
her
if
he
had
not
lost
with
her
his
gain
no
i
le
warrant
you
she
might
have
gone
to
the
devil
for
him
but
when
her
master
saw
that
the
hope
of
his
gain
was
gone
then
then
he
fell
to
persecuting
paul
but
badmans
master
did
sometimes
lose
by
badmans
sins
and
then
badman
and
his
master
were
at
odds
atten
alas
poor
badman
then
it
seems
thou
couldest
not
at
all
times
please
thy
like
wise
no
he
could
not
and
the
reason
i
have
told
you
atten
but
do
not
bad
masters
condemn
themselves
in
condemning
the
badness
of
their
servants
wise
yes
in
that
they
condemn
that
in
another
which
they
either
have
or
do
allow
in
themselves
and
the
time
will
come
when
that
very
sentence
that
hath
gone
out
of
their
own
mouths
against
the
sins
of
others
themselves
living
and
taking
pleasure
in
the
same
shall
return
with
violence
upon
their
own
pates
the
lord
pronounced
judgment
against
baasha
as
for
all
his
evils
in
general
so
for
this
in
special
because
he
was
like
the
house
of
jeroboam
and
yet
killed
him
this
is
badmans
masters
case
he
is
like
his
man
and
yet
he
beats
him
he
is
like
his
man
and
yet
he
rails
at
him
for
being
bad
atten
but
why
did
not
young
badman
run
away
from
this
master
as
he
ran
away
from
the
other
wise
he
did
not
and
if
i
be
not
mistaken
the
reason
why
was
this
there
was
godliness
in
the
house
of
the
first
and
that
young
badman
could
not
endure
for
fare
for
lodging
for
work
and
time
he
had
better
and
more
by
this
masters
allowance
than
ever
he
had
by
his
last
but
all
this
would
not
content
because
godliness
was
promoted
there
he
could
not
abide
this
praying
this
reading
of
scriptures
and
hearing
and
repeating
of
sermons
he
could
not
abide
to
be
told
of
his
transgressions
in
a
sober
and
godly
manner
atten
there
is
a
great
deal
in
the
manner
of
reproof
wicked
men
both
can
and
can
not
abide
to
hear
their
transgressions
spoken
against
wise
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difference
indeed
this
last
master
of
badmans
would
tell
badman
of
his
sins
in
badmans
own
dialect
he
would
swear
and
curse
and
damn
when
he
told
him
of
his
sins
and
this
he
could
bear
better
than
to
be
told
of
them
after
a
godly
sort
besides
that
last
master
would
when
his
passions
and
rage
was
over
laugh
at
and
make
merry
with
the
sins
of
his
servant
badman
and
that
would
please
young
badman
well
nothing
offended
badman
but
blows
and
those
he
had
but
few
of
now
because
he
was
pretty
well
grown
up
for
the
most
part
when
his
master
did
rage
and
swear
he
would
give
him
oath
for
oath
and
curse
for
curse
at
least
secretly
let
him
go
on
as
long
as
he
would
atten
this
was
hellish
living
wise
twas
hellish
living
indeed
and
a
man
might
say
that
with
this
master
young
badman
compleated
himself
yet
more
and
more
in
wickedness
as
well
as
in
his
trade
for
by
that
he
came
out
of
his
time
what
with
his
own
inclination
to
sin
what
with
his
acquaintance
with
his
three
companions
and
what
with
this
last
master
and
the
wickedness
he
saw
in
him
he
became
a
sinner
in
grain
i
think
he
had
a
bastard
laid
to
his
charge
before
he
came
out
of
his
time
atten
well
but
it
seems
he
did
live
to
come
out
of
his
time
but
what
did
he
then
wise
why
he
went
home
to
his
father
and
he
like
a
loving
and
father
received
him
into
his
house
atten
and
how
did
he
carry
it
there
wise
why
the
reason
why
he
went
home
was
for
money
to
set
up
for
himself
he
staied
but
a
little
at
home
but
that
little
while
that
he
did
stay
he
refrained
himself
as
well
he
could
and
did
not
so
much
discover
himself
to
be
base
for
fear
his
father
should
take
distaste
and
so
should
refuse
or
for
a
while
forbear
to
give
him
money
yet
even
then
he
would
have
his
times
and
companions
and
the
fill
of
his
lusts
with
them
but
he
used
to
blind
all
with
this
he
was
glad
to
see
his
old
acquaintance
and
they
as
glad
to
see
him
and
he
could
not
in
civility
but
accomodate
them
with
a
bottle
or
two
of
wine
or
a
dozen
or
two
of
drink
atten
and
did
the
old
man
give
him
money
to
set
up
with
wise
yes
above
two
hundred
pounds
atten
therein
i
think
the
old
man
was
out
had
i
been
his
father
i
would
have
held
him
a
little
at
till
i
had
had
far
better
proof
of
his
manners
to
be
good
for
i
perceive
that
his
father
did
know
what
a
naughty
boy
he
had
been
both
by
what
he
used
to
do
at
home
and
because
he
changed
a
good
master
for
a
bad
he
should
not
therefore
have
given
him
money
so
soon
what
if
he
had
pinched
a
little
and
gone
to
for
a
time
that
he
might
have
known
what
a
penny
was
by
his
earning
of
it
then
in
all
probability
he
had
known
better
how
to
have
spent
it
yea
and
by
that
time
perhaps
have
better
considered
with
himself
how
to
have
lived
in
the
world
ay
and
who
knows
but
he
might
have
come
to
himself
with
the
prodigal
and
have
asked
god
and
his
father
forgiveness
for
the
villanies
that
he
had
committed
against
them
wise
if
his
father
could
also
have
blessed
this
manner
of
dealing
to
him
and
have
made
it
effectual
for
the
ends
that
you
have
propounded
then
i
should
have
thought
as
you
but
alas
alas
you
talk
as
if
you
never
knew
or
had
at
this
present
forgot
what
the
bowels
and
compassions
of
a
father
are
why
did
you
not
serve
your
own
son
so
but
tis
evident
enough
that
we
are
better
at
giving
good
counsel
to
others
than
we
are
at
taking
good
counsel
our
selves
but
mine
honest
neighbour
suppose
that
badmans
father
had
done
as
you
say
and
by
so
doing
had
driven
his
son
to
ill
courses
what
had
he
bettered
either
himself
or
his
son
in
so
doing
atten
that
s
true
but
it
doth
not
follow
that
if
the
father
had
done
as
i
said
the
son
would
have
done
as
you
suppose
but
if
he
had
done
as
you
have
supposed
what
had
he
done
worse
than
what
he
hath
done
already
wise
he
had
done
bad
enough
that
s
true
but
suppose
his
father
had
given
him
no
money
and
suppose
that
young
badman
had
taken
a
pett
thereat
and
in
an
anger
had
gone
beyond
sea
and
his
father
had
neither
seen
him
nor
heard
of
him
more
or
suppose
that
of
a
mad
and
headstrong
stomach
he
had
gone
to
the
for
money
and
so
had
brought
himself
to
the
gallows
and
his
father
and
family
to
great
contempt
or
if
by
so
doing
he
had
not
brought
himself
to
that
end
yet
he
had
added
to
all
his
wickedness
such
and
such
evils
besides
and
what
comfort
could
his
father
have
had
in
this
besides
when
his
father
had
done
for
him
what
he
could
with
desire
to
make
him
an
honest
man
he
would
then
whether
his
son
had
proved
honest
or
no
have
laid
down
his
head
with
far
more
peace
than
if
he
had
taken
your
counsel
atten
nay
i
think
i
should
not
a
been
forward
to
have
given
advice
in
the
cause
but
truly
you
have
given
me
such
an
account
of
his
vilianies
that
the
hearing
thereof
has
made
me
angry
with
him
wise
in
an
angry
mood
we
may
soon
our
selves
but
poor
wretch
as
he
is
he
is
gone
to
his
place
but
as
i
said
when
a
good
father
hath
done
what
he
can
for
a
bad
child
and
that
child
shall
prove
never
the
better
he
will
lie
down
with
far
more
peace
than
if
through
severity
he
had
driven
him
to
inconveniencies
i
remember
that
i
have
heard
of
a
good
woman
that
had
as
this
old
man
a
bad
and
ungodly
son
and
she
prayed
for
him
counselled
him
and
carried
it
motherly
to
him
for
several
years
together
but
still
he
remained
bad
at
last
upon
a
time
after
she
had
been
at
prayer
as
she
was
wont
for
his
conversion
she
comes
to
him
and
thus
or
to
this
effect
begins
again
to
admonish
him
son
said
she
thou
hast
been
and
art
a
wicked
child
thou
hast
cost
me
many
a
prayer
and
tear
and
yet
thou
remainest
wicked
well
i
have
done
my
duty
i
have
done
what
i
can
to
save
thee
now
i
am
satisfied
that
if
i
shall
see
thee
damned
at
the
day
of
judgment
i
shall
be
so
far
off
from
being
grieved
for
thee
that
i
shall
rejoyce
to
hear
the
sentence
of
thy
damnation
at
that
day
and
it
converted
him
i
tell
you
that
if
parents
carry
it
lovingly
towards
their
children
mixing
their
mercies
with
loving
rebukes
and
their
loving
rebukes
with
fatherly
and
motherly
compassions
they
are
more
likely
to
save
their
children
than
by
being
churlish
and
severe
toward
them
but
if
they
do
not
save
them
if
their
mercy
doth
them
no
good
yet
it
will
greatly
ease
them
at
the
day
of
death
to
consider
i
have
done
by
love
as
much
as
i
could
to
save
and
deliver
my
child
from
hell
atten
well
i
yield
but
pray
let
us
return
again
to
badman
you
say
that
his
father
gave
him
a
piece
of
money
that
he
might
set
up
for
himself
wise
yes
his
father
did
give
him
a
piece
of
money
and
he
did
set
up
and
almost
as
soon
set
down
again
for
he
was
not
long
set
up
but
by
his
ill
managing
of
his
matters
at
home
together
with
his
extravagant
expences
abroad
he
was
got
so
far
into
debt
and
had
so
little
in
his
shop
to
pay
that
he
was
hard
put
to
it
to
keep
himself
out
of
prison
but
when
his
creditors
understood
that
he
was
about
to
marry
and
in
a
fair
way
to
get
a
rich
wife
they
said
among
themselves
we
will
not
be
hasty
with
him
if
he
gets
a
rich
wife
he
will
pay
us
all
atten
but
how
could
he
so
quickly
run
out
for
i
perceive
twas
in
little
time
by
what
you
say
wise
twas
in
little
time
indeed
i
think
he
was
not
above
two
years
and
a
half
in
doing
of
it
but
the
reason
is
apparent
for
he
being
a
wild
young
man
and
now
having
the
bridle
loose
before
him
and
being
wholly
subjected
to
his
lusts
and
vices
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
way
of
his
heart
and
to
the
sight
of
his
eye
forgetting
that
for
all
these
things
god
will
bring
him
to
judgment
and
he
that
doth
thus
you
may
be
sure
shall
not
be
able
long
to
stand
on
his
leggs
besides
he
had
now
an
addition
of
new
companions
companions
you
must
think
most
like
himself
in
manners
and
so
such
that
cared
not
who
sunk
if
they
themselves
might
swim
these
would
often
be
haunting
of
him
and
of
his
shop
too
when
he
was
absent
they
would
commonly
egg
him
to
the
but
yet
make
him
they
would
be
borrowing
also
money
of
him
but
take
no
care
to
pay
again
except
it
was
with
more
of
their
company
which
also
he
liked
very
well
and
so
his
poverty
came
like
one
that
travelleth
and
his
want
like
an
armed
man
but
all
the
while
they
studied
his
temper
he
loved
to
be
flattered
praised
and
commanded
for
wit
manhood
and
personage
and
this
was
like
stroking
him
over
the
face
thus
they
collogued
with
him
and
got
yet
more
and
more
into
him
and
so
like
they
drew
away
that
little
that
his
father
had
given
him
and
brought
him
quickly
down
almost
to
dwell
next
dore
to
the
begger
atten
then
was
the
saying
of
the
wise
man
fulfilled
he
that
keepeth
company
with
harlots
and
a
companion
of
fools
shall
be
destroyed
wise
ay
and
that
too
a
companion
of
riotous
persons
shameth
his
father
for
he
poor
man
had
both
grief
and
shame
to
see
how
his
son
now
at
his
own
hand
behaved
himself
in
the
enjoyment
of
those
good
things
in
and
under
the
lawfull
use
of
which
he
might
have
lived
to
gods
glory
his
own
comfort
and
credit
among
his
neighbours
but
he
that
followeth
vain
persons
shall
have
poverty
enough
the
way
that
he
took
led
him
directly
into
this
condition
for
who
can
expect
other
things
of
one
that
follows
such
courses
besides
when
he
was
in
his
shop
he
could
not
abide
to
be
doing
he
was
naturally
given
to
idleness
he
loved
to
live
high
but
his
hands
refused
to
labour
and
what
else
can
the
end
of
such
an
one
be
but
that
which
the
wise
man
saith
the
drunkard
and
the
glutton
shall
come
to
poverty
and
drowsiness
shall
cloath
a
man
with
rags
atten
but
now
methinks
when
he
was
brought
thus
low
he
should
have
considered
the
hand
of
god
that
was
gone
out
against
him
and
should
have
smote
upon
the
breast
and
have
returned
wise
consideration
good
consideration
was
far
from
him
he
was
as
stout
and
proud
now
as
ever
in
all
his
life
and
was
as
high
too
in
the
pursuit
of
his
sin
as
when
he
was
in
the
midst
of
his
fulness
only
he
went
now
like
a
tyred
jade
the
devil
had
rid
him
almost
off
of
his
leggs
atten
well
but
what
did
he
do
when
all
was
almost
gone
wise
two
things
were
now
his
play
he
bore
all
in
hand
by
swearing
and
cracking
and
lying
that
he
was
as
well
to
pass
as
he
was
the
first
day
he
set
up
for
himself
yea
that
he
had
rather
got
than
lost
and
he
had
at
his
beck
some
of
his
companions
that
would
swear
to
confirm
it
as
fast
as
he
atten
this
was
double
wickedness
twas
a
sin
to
say
it
and
another
to
swear
it
wise
that
s
true
but
what
evil
is
that
that
he
will
not
doe
that
is
left
of
god
as
i
believe
badman
was
atten
and
what
was
the
other
thing
wise
why
that
which
i
hinted
before
he
was
for
looking
out
for
a
rich
wife
and
now
i
am
come
to
some
more
of
his
invented
devised
designed
and
abominable
roguery
such
that
will
yet
declare
him
to
be
a
most
desperate
sinner
the
thing
was
this
a
wife
he
wanted
or
rather
money
for
as
for
a
woman
he
could
have
whores
enow
at
his
whistle
but
as
i
said
he
wanted
money
and
that
must
be
got
by
a
wife
or
no
way
nor
could
he
so
easily
get
a
wife
neither
except
he
became
an
artist
at
the
way
of
dissembling
nor
would
dissembling
do
among
that
people
that
could
dissemble
as
well
as
he
but
there
dwelt
a
maid
not
far
from
him
that
was
both
godly
and
one
that
had
a
good
portion
but
how
to
get
her
there
lay
all
the
craft
well
he
calls
a
council
of
some
of
his
most
trusty
and
cunning
companions
and
breaks
his
mind
to
them
to
wit
that
he
had
a
mind
to
marry
and
he
also
told
them
to
whom
but
said
he
how
shall
i
accomplish
my
end
she
is
religious
and
i
am
not
then
one
of
them
made
reply
saying
since
she
is
religious
you
must
pretend
to
be
so
likewise
and
that
for
some
time
before
you
go
to
her
mark
therefore
whither
she
goes
daily
to
hear
and
do
you
go
thither
also
but
there
you
must
be
sure
to
behave
your
self
soberly
and
make
as
if
you
liked
the
word
wonderful
well
stand
also
where
she
may
see
you
and
when
you
come
home
be
sure
that
you
walk
the
street
very
soberly
and
go
within
sight
of
her
this
done
for
a
while
then
go
to
her
and
first
talk
of
how
sorry
you
are
for
your
sins
and
shew
great
love
to
the
religion
that
she
is
of
still
speaking
well
of
her
preachers
and
of
her
godly
acquaintance
bewailing
your
hard
hap
that
it
was
not
your
lot
to
be
acquainted
with
her
and
her
sooner
and
this
is
the
way
to
get
her
also
you
must
write
down
sermons
talk
of
scriptures
and
protest
that
you
came
a
wooing
to
her
only
because
she
is
godly
and
because
you
should
count
it
your
greatest
happiness
if
you
might
but
have
such
an
one
as
for
her
money
slight
it
it
will
be
never
the
further
off
that
s
the
way
to
come
soonest
at
it
for
she
will
be
jealous
at
first
that
you
come
for
her
money
you
know
what
she
has
but
make
not
a
word
about
it
do
this
and
you
shall
see
if
you
do
not
intangle
the
lass
thus
was
the
snare
laid
for
this
poor
honest
maid
and
she
was
quickly
catched
in
his
pit
atten
why
did
he
take
this
counsel
wise
did
he
yes
and
after
a
while
went
as
boldly
to
her
and
that
under
a
vizzard
of
religion
as
if
he
had
been
for
honesty
and
godliness
one
of
the
most
sincere
and
in
england
he
observed
all
his
points
and
followed
the
advice
of
his
counsellers
and
quickly
obtained
her
too
for
natural
parts
he
had
he
was
tall
and
fair
and
had
plain
but
very
good
cloaths
on
his
back
and
his
religion
was
the
more
easily
attained
for
he
had
seen
something
in
the
house
of
his
father
and
first
master
and
so
could
the
more
readily
put
himself
into
the
form
and
shew
thereof
so
he
appointed
his
day
and
went
to
her
as
that
he
might
easily
do
for
she
had
neither
father
nor
mother
to
oppose
well
when
he
was
come
and
had
given
her
a
civil
complement
to
let
her
understand
why
he
was
come
then
he
began
and
told
her
that
he
had
found
in
his
heart
a
great
deal
of
love
to
her
person
and
that
of
all
the
damosels
in
the
world
he
had
pitched
upon
her
if
she
thought
fit
to
make
her
his
beloved
wife
the
reasons
as
he
told
her
why
he
had
pitched
upon
her
were
her
religious
and
personal
excellencies
and
therefore
intreated
her
to
take
his
condition
into
her
tender
and
loving
consideration
as
for
the
world
quoth
he
i
have
a
very
good
trade
and
can
maintain
my
self
and
family
well
while
my
wife
sits
still
on
her
seat
i
have
got
thus
and
thus
much
already
and
feel
money
come
in
every
day
but
that
is
not
the
thing
that
i
aim
at
tis
an
honest
and
godly
wife
then
he
would
present
her
with
a
good
book
or
two
pretending
how
much
good
he
had
got
by
them
himself
he
would
also
be
often
speaking
well
of
godly
ministers
especially
of
those
that
he
perceived
she
liked
and
loved
most
besides
he
would
be
often
telling
of
her
what
a
godly
father
he
had
and
what
a
new
man
he
was
also
become
himself
and
thus
did
this
treacherous
dealer
deal
with
this
honest
and
good
girl
to
her
great
grief
and
sorrow
as
afterward
you
shall
hear
atten
but
had
the
maid
no
friend
to
looke
after
her
wise
her
father
and
mother
were
dead
and
that
he
knew
well
enough
and
so
she
was
the
more
easily
overcome
by
his
naughty
lying
tongue
but
if
she
had
never
so
many
friends
she
might
have
been
beguiled
by
him
it
is
too
much
the
custom
of
young
people
now
to
think
themselves
wise
enough
to
make
their
own
choyce
and
that
they
need
not
ask
counsel
of
those
that
are
older
and
also
wiser
then
they
but
this
is
a
great
fault
in
them
and
many
of
them
have
paid
dear
for
it
well
to
be
short
in
little
time
badman
obtains
his
desire
gets
this
honest
girl
and
her
money
is
married
to
her
brings
her
home
makes
a
feast
entertains
her
royally
but
her
portion
must
pay
for
all
atten
this
was
wonderfull
deceitfull
doings
a
man
shall
seldom
hear
of
the
like
wise
by
this
his
doing
he
shewed
how
little
he
feared
god
and
what
little
dread
he
had
of
his
judgments
for
all
this
carriage
and
all
these
words
were
by
him
premeditated
evil
he
knew
he
lyed
he
knew
he
dissembled
yea
he
knew
that
he
made
use
of
the
name
of
god
of
religion
good
men
and
good
books
but
as
a
thereby
the
better
to
catch
his
game
in
all
this
his
glorious
pretense
of
religion
he
was
but
a
glorious
painted
hypocrite
and
hypocrisie
is
the
highest
sin
that
a
poor
carnal
wretch
can
attain
unto
it
is
also
a
sin
that
most
dareth
god
and
that
also
bringeth
the
greater
damnation
now
was
he
a
whited
wall
now
was
he
a
painted
sepulchre
now
was
he
a
grave
that
appeared
not
for
this
poor
honest
godly
damosel
little
thought
that
both
her
peace
and
comfort
and
estate
and
liberty
and
person
and
all
were
going
to
her
burial
when
she
was
going
to
be
married
to
badman
and
yet
so
it
was
she
enjoyed
her
self
but
little
afterwards
she
was
as
if
she
was
dead
and
buried
to
what
she
enjoyed
before
atten
certainly
some
wonderfull
judgment
of
god
must
attend
and
overtake
such
wicked
men
as
these
wise
you
may
be
sure
that
they
shall
have
judgment
to
the
full
for
all
these
things
when
the
day
of
judgment
is
come
but
as
for
judgment
upon
them
in
this
life
it
doth
not
alwayes
come
no
not
upon
those
that
are
worthy
thereof
they
that
tempt
god
are
delivered
and
they
that
work
wickedness
are
set
up
but
they
are
reserved
to
the
day
of
wrath
and
then
for
their
wickedness
god
will
repay
them
to
their
faces
the
wicked
is
reserved
to
the
day
of
destruction
they
shall
be
brought
forth
to
the
day
of
wrath
who
shall
declare
his
way
to
his
face
and
who
shall
repay
him
what
he
hath
done
yet
shall
he
be
brought
to
the
grave
and
remain
in
the
tomb
that
is
ordinarily
they
escape
god
s
hand
in
this
life
save
only
a
few
examples
are
made
that
others
may
be
cautioned
and
take
warning
thereby
but
at
the
day
of
judgment
they
must
be
rebuked
for
their
evil
with
the
lashes
of
devouring
fire
atten
can
you
give
me
no
examples
of
gods
wrath
upon
men
that
have
acted
this
tragical
wicked
deed
badman
wise
yes
hamor
and
shechem
and
all
the
men
of
their
city
for
attempting
to
make
god
and
religion
the
to
get
jacobs
daughters
to
wife
were
together
slain
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
a
judgment
of
god
upon
them
no
doubt
for
their
dissembling
in
that
matter
all
manner
of
lying
and
dissembling
is
dreadfull
but
to
make
god
and
religion
a
disguise
therewith
to
blind
thy
dissimulation
from
others
eyes
is
highly
provoking
to
the
divine
majesty
picture
take
note
symbol
i
knew
one
that
dwelt
not
far
off
from
our
town
that
got
him
a
wife
as
badman
got
his
but
he
did
not
enjoy
her
long
for
one
night
as
he
was
riding
home
from
his
companions
where
he
had
been
at
a
neighbouring
town
his
horse
threw
him
to
the
ground
where
he
was
found
dead
at
break
of
day
frightfully
and
lamentably
mangled
with
his
fall
and
besmeared
with
his
own
blood
atten
well
but
pray
return
again
to
badman
how
did
he
carry
it
to
his
wife
after
he
was
married
to
her
wise
nay
let
us
take
things
along
as
we
go
he
had
not
been
married
but
a
little
while
but
his
creditors
came
upon
him
for
their
money
he
deferred
them
a
little
while
but
at
last
things
were
come
to
that
point
that
pay
he
must
or
must
do
worse
so
he
appointed
them
a
time
and
they
came
for
their
money
and
he
payed
them
down
with
her
money
before
her
eyes
for
those
goods
that
he
had
profusely
spent
among
his
whores
long
before
besides
the
portion
that
his
father
gave
him
to
the
value
of
two
hundred
pounds
atten
this
beginning
was
bad
but
what
shall
i
say
twas
like
badman
himself
poor
woman
this
was
but
a
bad
beginning
for
her
i
fear
it
filled
her
with
trouble
enough
as
i
think
such
a
beginning
would
have
done
one
perhaps
much
stronger
than
she
wise
trouble
ay
you
may
be
sure
of
it
but
now
twas
too
late
to
repent
she
should
have
looked
better
to
herself
when
being
wary
would
have
done
her
good
her
harms
may
be
an
advantage
to
others
that
will
learn
to
take
heed
thereby
but
for
her
self
she
must
take
what
follows
even
such
a
life
now
as
badman
her
husband
will
lead
her
and
that
will
be
bad
enough
atten
this
beginning
was
bad
and
yet
i
fear
it
was
but
the
beginning
of
bad
wise
you
may
he
sure
that
it
was
but
the
beginning
of
badness
for
other
evils
came
on
apace
as
for
instance
it
was
but
a
little
while
after
he
was
married
but
he
hangs
his
religion
upon
the
hedge
or
rather
dealt
with
it
as
men
deal
with
their
old
cloaths
who
cast
them
off
or
leave
them
to
others
to
wear
for
his
part
he
would
be
religious
no
longer
now
therefore
he
had
pulled
off
his
vizzard
and
began
to
shew
himself
in
his
old
shape
a
base
wicked
debauched
fellow
and
now
the
poor
woman
saw
that
she
was
betrayed
indeed
now
also
his
old
companions
begin
to
flock
about
him
and
to
haunt
his
house
and
shop
as
formerly
and
who
with
them
but
badman
and
who
with
him
again
but
they
now
those
good
people
that
used
to
company
with
his
wife
began
to
be
ama
t
ed
and
discouraged
also
he
would
frown
and
gloat
upon
them
as
it
he
abhorred
the
appearance
of
them
so
that
in
little
time
he
drove
all
good
company
from
her
and
made
her
sit
solitary
by
herself
he
also
began
now
to
go
out
a
nights
to
those
drabs
who
were
his
familiars
before
with
whom
he
would
stay
somtimes
till
midnight
and
sometimes
till
almost
morning
and
then
would
come
home
as
drunk
as
a
swine
and
this
was
the
course
of
badman
now
when
he
came
home
in
this
case
if
his
wife
did
but
speak
a
word
to
him
about
where
he
had
been
and
why
he
had
so
abused
himself
though
her
words
were
spoken
in
never
so
much
meekness
and
love
then
she
was
whore
and
bitch
and
jade
and
twas
well
if
she
miss
d
his
fingers
and
heels
sometimes
also
he
would
bring
his
puncks
home
to
his
house
and
wo
be
to
his
wife
when
they
were
gone
if
she
did
not
entertain
them
with
all
varieties
possible
and
also
carry
it
lovingly
to
them
thus
this
good
woman
was
made
by
badman
her
husband
to
possess
nothing
but
disappointments
as
to
all
that
he
had
promised
her
or
that
she
hoped
to
have
at
his
hands
but
that
that
added
pressing
weight
to
all
her
sorrow
was
that
as
he
had
cast
away
all
religion
himself
so
he
attempted
if
possible
to
make
her
do
so
too
he
would
not
suffer
her
to
go
out
to
the
preaching
of
the
word
of
christ
nor
to
the
rest
of
his
appointments
for
the
health
and
salvation
of
her
soul
he
would
now
taunt
at
and
reflectingly
speak
of
her
preachers
and
would
receive
yea
raise
scandals
of
them
to
her
very
great
grief
and
affliction
now
she
scarce
durst
go
to
an
honest
neighbours
house
or
have
a
good
book
in
her
hand
specially
when
he
had
his
companions
in
his
house
or
had
got
a
little
drink
in
his
head
he
would
also
when
he
perceived
that
she
was
dejected
speak
tauntingly
and
mockingly
to
her
in
the
presence
of
his
companions
calling
of
her
his
religious
wife
his
demure
dame
and
the
like
also
he
would
make
a
sport
of
her
among
his
wanton
ones
abroad
if
she
did
ask
him
as
sometimes
she
would
to
let
her
go
out
to
a
sermon
he
would
in
a
currish
manner
reply
keep
at
home
keep
at
home
and
look
to
your
business
we
can
not
live
by
hearing
of
sermons
if
she
still
urged
that
he
would
let
her
goe
then
he
would
say
to
her
goe
if
you
dare
he
would
also
charge
her
with
giving
of
what
he
had
to
her
ministers
when
vile
wretch
he
had
spent
it
on
his
vain
companions
before
this
was
the
life
that
badmans
good
wife
lived
within
few
months
after
he
had
married
her
atten
this
was
a
disappointment
indeed
wise
a
disappointment
indeed
as
ever
i
think
poor
woman
had
one
would
think
that
the
knave
might
a
little
let
her
have
had
her
will
since
it
was
nothing
but
to
be
honest
and
since
she
brought
him
so
sweet
so
lumping
a
portion
for
she
brought
hundreds
into
his
house
i
say
one
would
think
he
should
have
let
her
had
her
own
will
a
little
since
she
desired
it
only
in
the
service
and
worship
of
god
but
could
she
win
him
to
grant
her
that
no
not
a
bit
if
it
would
have
saved
her
life
true
sometimes
she
would
steal
out
when
he
was
from
home
on
a
journey
or
among
his
drunken
companions
but
with
all
privacy
imaginable
and
poor
woman
this
advantage
she
had
she
carried
it
so
to
all
her
neighbours
that
though
many
of
them
were
but
carnal
yet
they
would
not
betray
her
or
tell
of
her
going
out
to
the
word
if
they
saw
it
but
would
rather
endeavour
to
hide
it
from
badman
himself
atten
this
carriage
of
his
to
her
was
enough
to
break
her
heart
wise
it
was
enough
to
do
it
indeed
yea
it
did
effectually
do
it
it
killed
her
in
time
yea
it
was
all
the
time
a
killing
of
her
she
would
when
she
sate
by
her
self
thus
mournfully
bewail
her
condition
wo
is
me
that
i
sojourn
in
meshech
and
that
i
dwell
in
the
tents
of
kedar
my
soul
hath
long
time
dwelt
with
him
that
hateth
peace
o
what
shall
be
given
unto
thee
thou
deceitful
tongue
or
what
shall
be
done
unto
thee
thou
false
tongue
i
am
a
woman
grieved
in
spirit
my
husband
has
bought
me
and
sold
me
for
his
lusts
twas
not
me
but
my
money
that
he
wanted
o
that
he
had
had
it
so
i
had
had
my
liberty
this
she
said
not
of
contempt
of
his
person
but
of
his
conditions
and
because
she
saw
that
by
his
hypocritical
tongue
he
had
brought
her
not
only
almost
to
beggery
but
robbed
her
of
the
word
of
god
atten
it
is
a
deadly
thing
i
see
to
be
unequally
yoaked
with
unbelievers
if
this
woman
had
had
a
good
husband
how
happily
might
they
have
lived
together
such
an
one
would
have
prayed
for
her
taught
her
and
also
would
have
encourages
her
in
the
faith
and
ways
of
god
but
now
poor
creature
instead
of
this
there
is
nothing
but
the
quite
contrary
wise
it
is
a
deadly
thing
indeed
and
therefore
by
the
word
of
god
his
people
are
forbid
to
be
joyned
in
marriage
with
them
be
not
saith
it
unequally
yoaked
together
with
unbelievers
for
what
fellowship
hath
righteousness
with
unrighteousness
and
what
communion
hath
light
with
darkness
and
what
concord
hath
christ
with
belial
or
what
part
hath
he
that
believeth
with
an
infidel
and
what
agreement
hath
the
temple
of
god
with
idols
there
can
be
no
agreement
where
such
matches
are
made
even
god
himself
hath
declared
the
contrary
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
i
says
he
will
put
enmity
betwixt
thee
and
the
woman
betwixt
thy
seed
and
her
seed
therefore
he
saith
in
another
place
they
can
mix
no
better
than
iron
and
clay
i
say
they
can
not
agree
they
can
not
be
one
and
therefore
they
should
be
aware
at
first
and
not
lightly
receive
such
into
their
affections
god
has
often
made
such
matches
bitter
especially
to
his
own
such
matches
are
as
god
said
of
elie
s
sons
that
were
spared
to
consume
the
eyes
and
to
grieve
the
heart
oh
the
wailing
and
lamentation
that
they
have
made
that
have
been
thus
yoaked
especially
if
they
were
such
as
would
be
so
yoaked
against
their
light
and
good
counsel
to
the
contrary
atten
alas
he
deluded
her
with
his
tongue
and
feigned
reformation
wise
well
well
she
should
have
gone
more
warily
to
work
what
if
she
had
acquainted
some
of
her
best
most
knowing
and
godly
friends
therewith
what
if
she
had
engaged
a
godly
minister
or
two
to
have
talked
with
badman
also
what
if
she
had
laid
wait
round
about
him
to
espie
if
he
was
not
otherwise
behind
her
back
than
he
was
before
her
face
and
besides
i
verily
think
since
in
the
multitude
of
counsellors
there
is
safety
that
if
she
had
acquainted
the
congregation
with
it
and
desired
them
to
spend
some
time
in
prayer
to
god
about
it
and
if
she
must
have
had
him
to
have
received
him
as
to
his
godliness
upon
the
judgment
of
others
rather
than
her
own
she
knowing
them
to
be
godly
and
judicious
and
unbiassed
men
she
had
had
more
peace
all
her
life
after
than
to
trust
to
her
own
poor
raw
womanish
judgment
as
she
did
love
is
blind
and
will
see
nothing
amiss
where
others
may
see
an
hundred
faults
therefore
i
say
she
should
not
have
trusted
to
her
own
thoughts
in
the
matter
of
his
goodness
as
to
his
person
there
she
was
fittest
to
judge
because
she
was
to
be
the
person
pleased
but
as
to
his
godliness
there
the
word
was
the
fittest
judge
and
they
that
could
best
understand
it
because
god
was
therein
to
be
pleased
i
wish
that
all
young
maidens
will
take
heed
of
being
beguiled
with
flattering
words
with
feigning
and
lying
speeches
and
take
the
best
way
to
preserve
themselves
from
being
bought
and
sold
by
wicked
men
as
she
was
lest
they
repent
with
her
when
as
to
this
repentance
will
do
them
no
good
but
for
their
unadvisedness
goe
sorrowing
to
their
graves
atten
well
things
are
past
with
this
poor
woman
and
can
not
be
called
back
let
others
beware
by
her
misfortunes
lest
they
also
fall
into
her
distress
wise
that
is
the
thing
that
i
say
let
them
take
heed
lest
for
their
unadvisedness
the
smart
as
this
poor
woman
has
done
and
ah
methinks
that
they
that
yet
are
single
persons
and
that
are
tempted
to
marry
to
such
as
badman
would
to
inform
and
warn
themselves
in
this
matter
before
they
intangle
themselves
but
goe
to
some
that
already
are
in
the
snare
and
ask
them
how
it
is
with
them
as
to
the
suitable
or
unsuitableness
of
their
marriage
and
desire
their
advice
surely
they
would
ring
such
a
peal
in
their
ears
about
the
unequality
unsuitableness
disadvantages
and
disquietments
and
sins
that
attend
such
marriages
that
would
make
them
beware
as
long
as
they
live
but
the
bird
in
the
air
knows
not
the
notes
of
the
bird
in
the
snare
untill
she
comes
thither
herself
besides
to
make
up
such
marriages
satan
and
carnal
reason
and
lust
or
at
least
inconsiderateness
has
the
chiefest
hand
and
where
these
things
bear
sway
designs
though
never
so
destructive
will
goe
headlong
on
and
therefore
i
fear
that
but
little
warning
will
be
taken
by
young
girls
at
badmans
wives
affliction
atten
but
are
there
no
disswasive
arguments
to
lay
before
such
to
prevent
their
future
misery
wise
yes
there
is
the
law
of
god
that
forbiddeth
marriage
with
unbelievers
these
kind
of
marriages
also
are
condemned
even
by
irrational
creatures
it
is
forbidden
by
the
law
of
god
both
in
the
old
testament
and
in
the
new
in
the
old
thou
shalt
not
make
marriages
with
them
thy
daughter
thou
shalt
not
give
unto
his
son
nor
his
daughter
shalt
thou
take
unto
thy
son
deut
in
the
new
testament
it
is
forbidden
be
ye
not
unequally
yoaked
together
with
unbelievers
let
them
marry
to
whom
they
will
only
in
the
lord
here
now
is
a
prohibition
plainly
forbidding
the
believer
to
marry
with
the
unbeliever
therefore
they
should
not
do
it
again
these
unwarrantable
marriages
are
as
i
may
so
say
condemned
by
irrational
creatures
who
will
not
couple
but
with
their
own
sort
will
the
sheep
couple
with
a
dog
the
partridge
with
a
crow
or
the
feasant
with
an
owl
no
they
will
strictly
tye
up
themselves
to
those
of
their
own
sort
only
yea
it
sets
all
the
world
a
wondring
when
they
see
or
hear
the
contrary
man
only
is
most
subject
to
wink
at
and
allow
of
these
unlawful
mixtures
of
men
and
women
because
man
only
is
a
sinful
beast
a
sinful
bird
therefore
he
above
all
will
take
upon
him
by
rebellious
actions
to
answer
or
rather
to
oppose
and
violate
the
law
of
his
god
and
creator
nor
shall
these
or
other
interogatories
what
fellowship
what
concord
what
agreement
what
communion
can
there
be
in
such
marriages
be
counted
of
weight
or
thought
worth
the
answering
by
him
but
further
the
dangers
that
such
do
commonly
run
themselves
into
should
be
to
others
a
disswasive
argument
to
stop
them
from
doing
the
like
for
besides
the
distresses
of
badmans
wife
many
that
have
had
very
hopefull
beginnings
for
heaven
have
by
vertue
of
the
mischiefs
that
have
attended
these
unlawfull
marriages
miserably
and
fearfully
miscarried
soon
after
such
marriages
conviction
the
first
step
toward
heaven
hath
ceased
prayer
the
next
step
toward
heaven
hath
ceased
hungrings
and
thirstings
after
salvation
another
step
towards
the
kingdom
of
heaven
have
ceased
in
a
word
such
marriages
have
estranged
them
from
the
word
from
their
godly
and
faithful
friends
and
have
brought
them
again
into
carnal
company
among
carnal
friends
and
also
into
carnal
delights
where
and
with
whom
they
have
in
conclusion
both
sinfully
abode
and
miserably
perished
and
this
is
one
reason
why
god
hath
forbidden
this
kind
of
unequal
marriages
for
they
saith
he
meaning
the
ungodly
will
turn
away
thy
son
from
following
me
that
they
may
serve
other
gods
so
will
the
anger
of
the
lord
be
kindled
against
you
and
destroy
you
suddenly
now
mark
there
were
some
in
israel
that
would
notwithstanding
this
prohibition
venture
to
marry
to
the
heathens
and
unbelievers
but
what
followed
they
served
their
idols
they
sacrificed
their
sons
and
their
daughters
unto
devils
thus
were
they
defiled
with
their
own
works
and
went
a
whoring
with
their
own
inventions
therefore
was
the
wrath
of
the
lord
kindled
against
his
people
insomuch
that
he
abhorred
his
own
inheritance
atten
but
let
s
return
again
to
badman
had
he
any
children
by
his
wife
wise
yes
seven
atten
i
doubt
they
were
but
badly
brought
up
wise
one
of
them
loved
its
mother
dearly
and
would
constantly
harken
to
her
voice
now
that
child
she
had
the
opportunity
to
instruct
in
the
principles
of
christian
religion
and
it
became
a
very
gracious
child
but
that
child
badman
could
not
abide
he
would
seldom
afford
it
a
pleasant
word
but
would
scowl
and
frown
upon
it
speak
churlishly
and
doggedly
to
it
and
though
as
to
nature
it
was
the
most
feeble
of
the
seven
yet
it
oftenest
felt
the
weight
of
its
fathers
fingers
three
of
his
children
did
directly
follow
his
steps
and
began
to
be
as
vile
as
in
his
youth
he
was
himself
the
other
that
remained
became
a
kind
of
mungrel
professors
not
so
bad
as
their
father
nor
so
good
as
their
mother
but
were
betwixt
them
both
they
had
their
mothers
notions
and
their
fathers
actions
and
were
much
like
those
that
you
read
of
in
the
book
of
nehemiah
these
children
spake
half
in
the
speech
of
ashdod
and
could
not
speak
in
the
jews
language
but
according
to
the
language
of
each
people
atten
what
you
say
in
this
matter
is
observable
and
if
i
take
not
my
mark
amiss
it
often
happeneth
after
this
manner
where
such
unlawful
marriages
are
contracted
wise
it
sometimes
doth
so
and
the
reason
with
respect
to
their
parents
is
this
where
the
one
of
the
parents
is
godly
and
the
other
ungodly
and
vile
though
they
can
agree
in
begetting
of
children
yet
they
strive
for
their
children
when
they
are
born
the
godly
parent
strives
for
the
child
and
by
prayers
counsel
and
good
examples
labours
to
make
it
holy
in
body
and
soul
and
so
fit
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
the
ungodly
would
have
it
like
himself
wicked
and
base
and
sinful
and
so
they
both
give
instructions
accordingly
instructions
did
i
say
yea
and
examples
too
according
to
their
minds
thus
the
godly
as
hannah
is
presenting
her
samuel
unto
the
lord
but
the
ungodly
like
them
that
went
before
them
are
for
offering
their
children
to
moloch
to
an
idol
to
sin
to
the
devil
and
to
hell
thus
one
harkeneth
to
the
law
of
their
mother
and
is
preserved
from
destruction
but
as
for
the
other
as
their
fathers
did
so
do
they
thus
did
badman
and
his
wife
part
some
of
their
children
betwixt
them
but
as
for
the
other
three
that
were
as
twere
mungrels
betwixt
both
they
were
like
unto
those
that
you
read
of
in
kings
they
feared
the
lord
but
served
their
own
idols
they
had
as
i
sail
their
mothers
notions
and
i
will
adde
profession
too
but
their
fathers
lusts
and
something
of
his
life
now
their
father
did
not
like
them
because
they
had
their
mothers
tongue
and
the
mother
did
not
like
them
because
they
had
still
their
fathers
heart
and
life
nor
were
they
indeed
fit
company
for
good
or
bad
the
good
would
not
trust
them
because
they
were
bad
the
bad
would
not
trust
them
because
they
were
good
viz
the
good
would
not
trust
them
because
they
were
bad
in
their
lives
and
the
bad
would
not
trust
them
because
they
were
good
in
their
words
so
they
were
forced
with
esau
to
joyn
in
affinity
with
ishmael
to
wit
to
look
out
a
people
that
were
hypocrites
like
themselves
and
with
them
they
matcht
and
lived
and
died
atten
poor
woman
she
could
not
but
have
much
perplexity
wise
yea
and
poor
children
that
ever
they
were
sent
into
the
world
as
the
fruit
of
the
loyns
and
under
the
government
of
such
a
father
as
badman
atten
you
say
right
for
such
children
lye
almost
under
all
manner
of
disadvantages
but
we
must
say
nothing
because
this
also
is
the
sovereign
will
of
god
wise
we
may
not
by
any
means
object
against
god
yet
we
may
talk
of
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
that
children
have
by
having
for
their
parents
such
as
are
either
godly
or
the
contrary
atten
you
say
right
we
may
so
and
pray
now
since
we
are
about
it
speak
something
in
brief
unto
it
that
is
unto
this
what
advantage
those
children
have
above
others
that
have
for
their
parents
such
as
indeed
are
godly
wise
so
i
will
only
i
must
first
premise
these
two
or
three
things
they
have
not
the
advantage
of
election
for
their
fathers
sakes
they
are
born
as
others
the
children
of
wrath
though
they
come
of
godly
parents
grace
comes
not
unto
them
as
an
inheritance
because
they
have
godly
parents
these
things
premised
i
shall
now
proceed
the
children
of
godly
parents
are
the
children
of
many
prayers
they
are
prayed
for
before
and
prayed
for
after
they
are
born
and
the
prayer
of
a
godly
father
and
godly
mother
doth
much
they
have
the
advantage
of
what
restraint
is
possible
from
what
evils
their
parents
see
them
inclinable
to
and
that
is
a
second
mercy
they
have
the
advantage
of
godly
instruction
and
of
being
told
which
be
and
which
be
not
the
right
ways
of
the
lord
they
have
also
those
ways
commended
unto
them
and
spoken
well
of
in
their
hearing
that
are
good
such
are
also
what
may
be
kept
out
of
evil
company
from
evil
books
and
from
being
taught
the
way
of
swearing
lying
and
the
like
as
and
mocking
at
good
men
and
good
things
and
this
is
a
very
great
mercy
they
have
also
the
benefit
of
a
godly
life
set
before
them
doctrinally
by
their
parents
and
that
doctrine
backt
with
a
godly
and
holy
example
and
all
these
are
very
great
advantages
now
all
these
advantages
the
children
of
ungodly
parents
want
and
so
are
more
in
danger
of
being
carried
away
with
the
error
of
the
wicked
for
ungodly
parents
neither
pray
for
their
children
nor
do
nor
can
they
heartily
instruct
them
they
do
not
after
a
godly
manner
restrain
them
from
evil
nor
do
they
keep
them
from
evil
company
they
are
not
grieved
at
nor
yet
do
they
forewarn
their
children
to
beware
of
such
evil
actions
that
are
abomination
to
god
and
to
all
good
men
they
let
their
children
break
the
sabbath
swear
lye
be
wicked
and
vain
they
commend
not
to
their
children
an
holy
life
nor
set
a
good
example
before
their
eyes
no
they
do
in
all
things
contrary
estranging
of
their
children
what
they
can
from
the
love
of
god
and
all
good
men
so
soon
as
they
are
born
therefore
it
is
a
very
great
judgment
of
god
upon
children
to
be
the
offspring
of
base
and
ungodly
men
atten
well
but
before
we
leave
badmans
wife
and
children
i
have
a
mind
if
you
please
to
enquire
a
little
more
after
one
thing
the
which
i
am
sure
you
can
satisfie
me
in
wise
what
is
that
atten
you
said
a
while
ago
that
this
badman
would
not
suffer
his
wife
to
go
out
to
hear
such
godly
ministers
as
she
liked
but
said
if
she
did
she
had
as
good
never
come
home
any
more
did
he
often
carry
it
thus
to
her
wise
he
did
say
so
he
did
often
say
so
this
i
told
you
then
and
had
also
then
told
you
more
but
that
other
things
put
me
out
atten
well
said
pray
therefore
now
go
on
wise
so
i
will
upon
a
time
she
was
on
a
lords
day
for
going
to
hear
a
sermon
and
badman
was
unwilling
she
should
but
she
at
that
time
as
it
seems
did
put
on
more
courage
than
she
was
wont
and
therefore
after
she
had
spent
upon
him
a
great
many
fair
words
and
entreaties
if
perhaps
she
might
have
prevailed
by
them
but
all
to
no
purpose
at
all
at
last
she
said
she
would
go
and
rendred
this
reason
for
it
i
have
an
husband
but
also
a
god
my
god
has
commanded
me
and
that
upon
pain
of
damnation
to
be
a
continual
worshipper
of
him
and
that
in
the
way
of
his
own
appointments
i
have
an
husband
but
also
a
soul
and
my
soul
ought
to
be
more
unto
me
than
all
the
world
besides
this
soul
of
mine
i
will
look
after
care
for
and
if
i
can
provide
it
an
heaven
for
its
habitation
you
are
commanded
to
love
me
as
you
love
your
own
body
and
so
do
i
love
you
but
i
tell
you
true
i
preferr
my
soul
before
all
the
world
and
its
salvation
i
will
seek
at
this
first
he
gave
her
an
ugly
wish
and
then
fell
into
a
fearfull
rage
and
sware
moreover
that
if
she
did
go
he
would
make
both
her
and
all
her
damnable
brotherhood
for
so
he
was
pleased
to
call
them
to
repent
their
coming
thither
atten
but
what
should
he
mean
by
that
wise
you
may
easily
guess
what
he
meant
he
meant
he
would
turn
informer
and
so
either
weary
out
those
that
she
loved
from
meeting
together
to
worship
god
or
make
them
pay
dearly
for
their
so
doing
the
which
if
he
did
he
knew
it
would
vex
every
vein
of
her
tender
heart
atten
but
do
you
think
badman
would
have
been
so
base
wise
truly
he
had
malice
and
enmity
enough
in
his
heart
to
do
it
onely
he
was
a
tradesman
also
he
knew
that
he
must
live
by
his
neighbours
and
so
he
had
that
little
wit
in
his
anger
that
he
refrained
himself
and
did
it
not
but
as
i
said
he
had
malice
and
envy
enough
in
his
heart
to
have
made
him
to
do
it
only
he
thought
it
would
worst
him
in
his
trade
yet
these
three
things
he
would
be
doing
he
would
be
putting
of
others
on
to
molest
and
abuse
her
friends
he
would
be
glad
when
he
heard
that
any
mischief
befell
them
and
would
laugh
at
her
when
he
saw
her
troubled
for
them
and
now
i
have
told
you
badmans
way
as
to
this
atten
but
was
he
not
afraid
of
the
judgments
of
god
that
did
fly
about
at
that
time
wise
he
regarded
not
the
judgment
nor
mercy
of
god
for
had
he
at
all
done
that
he
could
not
have
done
as
he
did
but
what
judgments
do
you
mean
atten
such
judgments
that
if
mr
badman
himself
had
taken
but
sober
notice
of
they
might
have
made
him
a
hung
down
his
ears
wise
why
have
you
heard
of
any
such
persons
that
the
judgments
of
god
have
overtaken
atten
yes
and
so
i
believe
have
you
too
though
you
make
so
strange
about
it
wise
i
have
so
indeed
to
my
astonishment
and
wonder
atten
pray
therefore
if
you
please
tell
me
what
it
is
as
to
this
that
you
know
and
then
perhaps
i
may
also
say
something
to
you
of
the
same
wise
picture
take
note
symbol
in
our
town
there
was
one
a
man
of
a
very
wicked
life
and
he
when
there
seemed
to
be
countenance
given
to
it
would
needs
turn
informer
well
so
he
did
and
was
as
diligent
in
his
business
as
most
of
them
could
be
he
would
watch
a
nights
climb
trees
and
range
the
woods
a
days
if
possible
to
find
out
the
meeters
for
then
they
were
forced
to
meet
in
the
fields
yea
he
would
curse
them
bitterly
and
swear
most
fearfully
what
he
would
do
to
them
when
he
found
them
well
after
he
had
gone
on
like
a
bedlam
in
his
course
a
while
and
had
done
some
mischiefs
to
the
people
he
was
stricken
by
the
hand
of
god
and
that
in
this
manner
although
he
had
his
tongue
naturally
at
will
now
he
was
taken
with
a
faultering
in
his
speech
and
could
not
for
weeks
together
speak
otherwise
than
just
like
a
man
that
was
drunk
then
he
was
taken
with
a
drauling
or
slabbering
at
his
mouth
which
slabber
sometimes
would
hang
at
his
mouth
well
nigh
half
way
down
to
the
ground
then
he
had
such
a
weakness
in
the
back
sinews
of
his
neck
that
oft
times
he
could
not
look
up
before
him
unless
he
clapped
his
hand
hard
upon
his
forehead
and
held
up
his
head
that
way
by
strength
of
hand
after
this
his
speech
went
quite
away
and
he
could
speak
no
more
than
a
swine
or
a
bear
therefore
like
one
of
them
he
would
gruntle
and
make
an
ugly
noyse
according
as
he
was
offended
or
pleased
or
would
have
any
thing
done
in
this
posture
he
continued
for
the
space
of
half
a
year
or
thereabouts
all
the
while
otherwise
well
and
could
go
about
his
business
save
once
that
he
had
a
fall
from
the
bell
as
it
hangs
in
our
steeple
which
twas
a
wonder
it
did
not
kill
him
but
after
that
he
also
walked
about
till
god
had
made
him
a
sufficient
spectacle
of
his
judgment
for
his
sin
and
then
on
a
sudden
he
was
stricken
and
dyed
miserably
and
so
there
was
an
end
of
him
and
his
doings
i
will
tell
you
of
another
picture
take
note
symbol
about
four
miles
from
neots
there
was
a
gentleman
had
a
man
and
he
would
needs
be
an
informer
and
a
lusty
young
man
he
was
well
an
informer
he
was
and
did
much
distress
some
people
and
had
perfected
his
informations
so
effectually
against
some
that
there
was
nothing
further
to
do
but
for
the
constables
to
make
distress
on
the
people
that
he
might
have
the
money
or
goods
and
as
i
heard
he
hastened
them
much
to
do
it
now
while
he
was
in
the
heat
of
his
work
as
he
stood
one
day
by
the
he
had
it
should
seem
a
mind
to
a
sop
in
the
pan
for
the
spit
was
then
at
the
fire
so
he
went
to
make
him
one
but
behold
a
dog
so
say
his
own
dog
took
distaste
at
something
and
bit
his
master
by
the
leg
the
which
bite
notwithstanding
all
the
means
that
was
used
to
cure
him
turned
as
was
said
to
a
gangrene
however
that
wound
was
his
death
and
that
a
dreadful
one
too
for
my
relator
said
that
he
lay
in
such
a
condition
by
this
bite
as
the
beginning
till
his
flesh
rotted
from
off
him
before
he
went
out
of
the
world
but
what
need
i
instance
in
particular
persons
when
the
judgement
of
god
against
this
kind
of
people
was
made
manifest
i
think
i
may
say
if
not
in
all
yet
in
most
of
the
counties
in
england
where
such
poor
creatures
were
but
i
would
if
it
had
been
the
will
of
god
that
neither
i
nor
any
body
else
could
tell
you
more
of
these
stories
true
stories
that
are
neither
lye
nor
romance
atten
well
i
also
heard
of
both
these
my
self
and
of
more
too
as
remarkable
in
their
kind
as
these
if
i
had
any
list
to
tell
them
but
let
us
leave
those
that
are
behind
to
others
or
to
the
coming
of
christ
who
then
will
justifie
or
condemn
them
as
the
merit
of
their
work
shall
require
or
if
they
repented
and
found
mercy
i
shall
be
glad
when
i
know
it
for
i
wish
not
a
curse
to
the
soul
of
mine
enemy
wise
there
can
be
no
pleasure
in
the
telling
of
such
stories
though
to
hear
of
them
may
do
us
a
pleasure
they
may
put
us
in
mind
that
there
is
a
god
that
judgeth
in
the
earth
and
that
doth
not
alwayes
forget
nor
deferre
to
hear
the
crye
of
the
destitute
they
also
carry
along
with
them
both
caution
and
counsel
to
those
that
are
the
survivors
of
such
let
us
tremble
at
the
judgements
of
god
and
be
afraid
of
sinning
against
him
and
it
shall
be
our
protection
it
shall
go
well
with
them
that
fear
god
that
fear
before
him
atten
well
sir
as
you
have
intimated
so
i
think
we
have
in
this
place
spoken
enough
about
these
kind
of
men
if
you
please
let
us
return
again
to
badman
himself
if
you
have
any
more
to
say
of
him
wise
more
we
have
yet
scarce
throughly
begun
with
any
thing
that
we
have
said
all
the
particulars
are
in
themselves
so
full
of
badness
that
we
have
rather
only
looked
in
them
than
indeed
said
any
thing
to
them
but
we
will
pass
them
and
proceed
you
have
heard
of
the
sins
of
his
youth
of
his
apprentiship
and
how
he
set
up
and
married
and
what
a
life
he
hath
led
his
wife
and
now
i
will
tell
you
some
more
of
his
pranks
he
had
the
very
knack
of
knavery
had
he
as
i
said
before
been
bound
to
serve
an
apprentiship
to
all
these
things
he
could
not
have
been
more
cunning
he
could
not
have
been
more
artificial
at
it
atten
nor
perhaps
so
artificially
neither
for
as
none
can
teach
goodness
like
to
god
himself
so
concerning
sin
and
knavery
none
can
teach
a
man
it
like
the
devil
to
whom
as
i
perceive
badman
went
to
school
from
his
childhood
to
the
end
of
his
life
but
pray
sir
make
a
beginning
wise
well
so
i
will
you
may
remember
that
i
told
you
what
a
condition
he
was
in
for
money
before
he
did
marry
and
how
he
got
a
rich
wife
with
whose
money
he
paid
his
debts
now
when
he
had
paid
his
debts
he
having
some
moneys
left
he
sets
up
again
as
briskly
as
ever
keeps
a
great
shop
drives
a
great
trade
and
runs
again
a
great
way
into
debt
but
now
not
into
the
debt
of
one
or
two
but
into
the
debt
of
many
so
that
at
last
he
came
to
owe
some
thousands
and
thus
he
went
on
a
good
while
and
to
pursue
his
ends
the
better
he
began
now
to
study
to
please
all
men
and
to
suit
himself
to
any
company
he
could
now
be
as
they
say
as
they
that
is
if
he
listed
and
then
he
would
list
when
he
perceived
that
by
so
doing
he
might
either
make
them
his
customers
or
creditors
for
his
commodities
if
he
dealt
with
honest
men
as
with
some
honest
men
he
did
then
he
would
be
as
they
talk
as
they
seem
to
be
sober
as
they
talk
of
justice
and
religion
as
they
and
against
debauchery
as
they
yea
and
would
too
seem
to
shew
a
dislike
of
them
that
said
did
or
were
otherwise
than
honest
again
when
he
did
light
among
those
that
were
bad
then
he
would
be
as
they
but
yet
more
close
and
cautiously
except
he
were
sure
of
his
company
then
he
would
carry
it
openly
be
as
they
say
damn
em
and
sink
em
as
they
if
they
railed
on
good
men
so
could
he
if
they
railed
on
religion
so
could
he
if
they
talked
beastly
vainly
idlely
so
would
he
if
they
were
for
drinking
swearing
whoring
or
any
the
like
villanies
so
was
he
this
was
now
the
path
he
trod
in
and
could
do
all
artificially
as
any
man
alive
and
now
he
thought
himself
a
perfect
man
he
thought
he
was
always
a
boy
till
now
what
think
you
now
of
badman
atten
think
why
i
think
he
was
an
atheist
for
no
man
but
an
atheist
can
do
this
i
say
it
can
not
be
but
that
the
man
that
is
such
as
this
badman
must
be
a
rank
and
stinking
atheist
for
he
that
believes
that
there
is
either
god
or
devil
heaven
or
hell
or
death
and
judgment
after
can
not
doe
as
badman
did
i
mean
if
he
could
do
these
things
without
reluctancy
and
check
of
conscience
yea
if
he
had
not
sorrow
and
remorse
for
such
abominable
sins
as
these
wise
nay
he
was
so
far
off
from
reluctancies
and
remorse
of
conscience
for
these
things
that
he
counted
them
the
excellency
of
his
attainments
the
quintessence
of
his
wit
his
rare
and
singular
vertues
such
as
but
few
besides
himself
could
be
the
masters
of
therefore
as
for
those
that
made
boggle
and
stop
at
things
and
that
could
not
in
conscience
and
for
fear
of
death
and
judgement
do
such
things
as
he
he
would
call
them
fools
and
noddies
and
charge
them
for
being
frighted
with
the
talk
of
unseen
bugbears
and
would
encourage
them
if
they
would
be
men
indeed
to
labour
after
the
attainment
of
this
his
excellent
art
he
would
please
himself
with
the
thoughts
of
what
he
could
do
in
this
matter
saying
within
himself
i
can
be
religious
and
irreligious
i
can
be
any
thing
or
nothing
i
can
swear
and
speak
against
swearing
i
can
lye
and
speak
against
lying
i
can
drink
wench
be
unclean
and
defraud
and
not
be
troubled
for
it
now
i
enjoy
my
self
and
am
master
of
mine
own
wayes
and
not
they
of
me
this
i
have
attained
with
much
study
great
care
and
more
pains
but
this
his
talk
should
be
only
with
himself
to
his
wife
who
he
knew
durst
not
divulge
it
or
among
his
intimates
to
whom
he
knew
he
might
say
any
thing
atten
did
i
call
him
before
an
atheist
i
may
call
him
now
a
devil
or
a
man
possessed
with
one
if
not
with
many
i
think
that
there
can
not
be
found
in
every
corner
such
an
one
as
this
true
it
is
said
of
king
ahaz
that
be
sinned
more
and
more
and
of
ahab
that
he
sold
himself
to
work
wickedness
and
of
the
men
of
sodom
that
they
were
sinners
exceedingly
before
the
lord
wise
an
atheist
he
was
no
doubt
if
there
be
such
a
thing
as
an
atheist
in
the
world
but
for
all
his
brags
of
perfection
and
security
in
his
wickedness
i
believe
that
at
times
god
did
let
down
fire
from
heaven
into
his
conscience
true
i
believe
he
would
quickly
put
it
out
again
and
grow
more
desperate
and
wicked
afterward
but
this
also
turned
to
his
destruction
as
afterward
you
may
hear
but
i
am
not
of
your
mind
to
think
that
there
are
but
few
such
in
the
world
except
you
mean
as
to
the
degree
of
wickedness
unto
which
he
had
attained
for
otherwise
no
doubt
there
is
abundance
of
such
as
he
men
of
the
same
mind
of
the
same
principles
and
of
the
same
conscience
too
to
put
them
into
practice
yea
i
believe
that
there
are
many
that
are
endeavouring
to
attain
to
the
same
pitch
of
wickedness
and
all
them
are
such
as
he
in
the
judgment
of
the
law
nor
will
their
want
of
hellish
wit
to
attain
thereto
excuse
them
at
the
day
of
judgment
you
know
that
in
all
science
some
are
more
arch
than
some
and
so
it
is
in
the
art
as
well
as
in
the
practice
of
wickedness
some
are
and
some
more
the
children
of
hell
than
others
and
yet
all
the
children
of
hell
else
they
would
all
be
masters
and
none
scholars
in
the
school
of
wickedness
but
there
must
be
masters
and
there
must
be
learners
badman
was
a
master
in
this
art
and
therefore
it
follows
that
he
must
be
an
arch
and
chief
one
in
that
mystery
atten
you
are
in
the
right
for
i
perceive
that
some
men
though
they
desire
it
can
not
be
so
arch
in
the
practice
thereof
as
others
but
are
as
i
suppose
they
call
them
fools
and
dunces
to
the
rest
their
heads
and
capacities
will
not
serve
them
to
act
and
do
so
wickedly
but
badman
wanted
not
a
wicked
head
to
contrive
as
well
as
a
wicked
heart
to
do
his
wickedness
wise
true
but
yet
i
say
such
men
shall
at
the
day
of
judgment
be
judged
not
only
for
what
they
are
but
also
for
what
they
would
be
for
if
the
thought
of
foolishness
is
sin
doubtless
the
desire
of
foolishness
is
more
sin
and
if
the
desire
be
more
the
endeavour
after
it
must
needs
be
more
and
more
he
then
that
is
not
an
artificial
atheist
and
transgressor
yet
if
he
desires
to
be
so
if
he
endeavoureth
to
be
so
he
shall
be
judged
and
condemned
to
hell
for
such
an
one
for
the
law
judgeth
men
as
i
said
according
to
what
they
would
be
he
that
looketh
upon
a
woman
to
lust
after
her
hath
committed
adultery
with
her
already
in
his
heart
by
the
same
rule
he
that
would
steal
doth
steal
he
that
would
cheat
doth
cheat
he
that
would
swear
doth
swear
and
he
that
would
commit
adultery
doth
do
so
for
god
judgeth
men
according
to
the
working
of
their
minds
and
saith
as
he
thinketh
so
is
he
that
is
so
is
he
in
his
heart
in
his
intentions
in
his
desires
in
his
endeavours
and
gods
law
i
say
lays
hold
of
the
desires
intentions
and
endeavours
even
as
it
lays
hold
of
the
act
of
wickedness
it
self
a
man
then
that
desires
to
be
as
bad
as
badman
and
desires
to
be
so
wicked
have
many
in
their
hearts
though
he
never
attains
to
that
proficiency
in
wickedness
as
he
shall
yet
be
judged
for
as
bad
a
man
as
he
because
twas
in
his
desires
to
be
such
a
wicked
one
atten
but
this
height
of
wickedness
in
badman
will
not
yet
out
of
my
mind
this
hard
desperate
or
what
shall
i
call
it
diabolicall
frame
of
heart
was
in
him
a
foundation
a
to
all
acts
and
deeds
that
were
evil
wise
the
heart
and
the
desperate
wickedness
of
it
is
the
foundation
and
groundwork
of
all
atheism
professed
and
practicall
spring
both
out
of
the
heart
yea
and
all
manner
of
evils
besides
for
they
be
not
bad
deeds
that
make
a
bad
man
but
he
is
already
a
bad
man
that
doth
bad
deeds
a
man
must
be
wicked
before
he
can
do
wickedness
wickedness
proceedeth
from
the
wicked
tis
an
evil
tree
that
bears
evil
fruit
men
gather
no
grapes
of
thorns
the
heart
therefore
must
be
evil
before
the
man
can
do
evil
and
good
before
the
man
doth
good
atten
now
i
see
the
reason
why
badman
was
so
base
as
to
get
a
wife
by
dissimulation
and
to
abuse
her
so
like
a
villain
when
he
had
got
her
it
was
because
he
was
before
by
a
wicked
heart
prepared
to
act
wickedness
wise
you
may
be
sure
of
it
for
from
within
out
of
the
heart
of
man
proccedeth
evil
thoughts
adulteries
fornications
murders
thefts
coveteousness
wickedness
deceit
lasciviousness
an
evil
eye
blasphemy
pride
foolishness
all
these
things
come
from
within
and
defile
a
man
and
a
man
as
his
naughty
mind
inclines
him
makes
use
of
these
or
any
of
these
to
gratifie
his
lust
to
promote
his
designs
to
revenge
his
malice
to
enrich
or
to
wallow
himself
in
the
foolish
pleasures
and
pastimes
of
this
life
and
all
these
did
badman
do
even
to
the
utmost
if
either
opportunity
or
purse
or
perfidiousness
would
help
him
to
the
obtaining
of
his
purpose
atten
purse
why
he
could
not
but
have
purse
to
do
almost
what
he
would
having
married
a
wife
with
so
much
money
wise
hold
you
there
some
of
badmans
sins
were
costly
as
his
drinking
and
whoring
and
keeping
other
bad
company
though
he
was
a
man
that
had
ways
too
many
to
get
money
as
well
as
ways
too
many
to
spend
it
atten
had
he
then
such
a
good
trade
for
all
he
was
such
a
bad
man
or
was
his
calling
so
gainfull
to
him
as
alwayes
to
keep
his
purses
belly
full
though
he
was
himself
a
great
spender
wise
no
it
was
not
his
trade
that
did
it
though
he
had
a
pretty
trade
too
he
had
another
way
to
get
money
and
that
by
hatfulls
and
pocketfulls
at
a
time
atten
why
i
trow
he
was
no
highway
man
was
he
wise
i
will
be
sparing
in
my
speech
as
to
that
though
some
have
muttered
as
if
he
could
ride
out
now
and
then
about
no
body
but
himself
knew
what
over
night
and
come
home
all
dirty
and
weary
next
morning
but
that
is
not
the
thing
i
aim
at
atten
pray
let
me
know
it
if
you
think
it
convenient
that
i
should
wise
i
will
tell
you
it
was
this
he
had
an
art
to
break
and
get
hatfulls
of
money
by
breaking
atten
but
what
do
you
mean
by
badmans
breaking
you
speak
mystically
do
you
not
wise
no
no
i
speak
plainly
or
if
you
will
have
it
in
plainer
language
tis
this
when
badman
had
swaggered
and
whored
away
most
of
his
wifes
portion
he
began
to
feel
that
he
could
not
much
longer
stand
upon
his
legs
in
this
course
of
life
and
keep
up
his
trade
and
repute
such
as
he
had
in
the
world
but
by
the
new
engine
of
breaking
wherefore
upon
a
time
he
gives
a
great
and
sudden
rush
into
several
mens
debts
to
the
value
of
about
four
or
five
thousand
pound
driving
at
the
same
time
a
very
great
trade
by
selling
many
things
for
less
than
they
cost
him
to
get
him
custom
therewith
to
blind
his
creditors
eyes
his
creditors
therefore
feeling
that
he
had
a
great
employ
and
dreaming
that
it
must
needs
at
length
turn
to
a
very
good
account
to
them
trusted
him
freely
without
mistrust
and
so
did
others
too
to
the
value
of
what
was
mentioned
before
well
when
badman
had
well
feathered
his
nest
with
other
mens
goods
and
money
after
a
little
time
he
breaks
and
by
and
by
it
is
noysed
abroad
that
badman
had
shut
up
shop
was
gone
and
could
trade
no
longer
now
by
that
time
his
breaking
was
come
to
his
creditors
ears
he
had
by
craft
and
knavery
made
so
sure
of
what
he
had
that
his
creditors
could
not
touch
a
penny
well
when
he
had
done
he
sends
his
mournfull
sugered
letters
to
his
creditors
to
let
them
understand
what
had
happened
unto
him
and
desired
them
not
to
be
severe
with
him
for
he
bore
towards
all
men
an
honest
mind
and
would
pay
so
far
as
he
was
able
now
he
sends
his
letters
by
a
man
confederate
with
him
who
could
make
both
the
worst
and
best
of
badmans
case
the
best
for
badman
and
the
worst
for
his
creditors
so
when
he
comes
to
them
he
both
bemoans
them
and
condoles
badmans
condition
telling
of
them
that
without
a
speedy
bringing
of
things
to
a
conclusion
badman
would
be
able
to
make
them
no
satisfaction
but
at
present
he
both
could
and
would
and
that
to
the
utmost
of
his
power
and
to
that
end
he
desired
that
they
would
come
over
to
him
well
his
creditors
appoint
him
a
time
and
come
over
and
he
mean
while
authorizes
another
to
treat
with
them
but
will
not
be
seen
himself
unless
it
was
on
a
sunday
lest
they
should
snap
him
with
a
writ
so
his
deputed
friend
treats
with
them
about
their
concern
with
badman
first
telling
them
of
the
great
care
that
badman
took
to
satisfie
them
and
all
men
for
whatsoever
he
ought
as
far
as
in
him
lay
and
how
little
he
thought
a
while
since
to
be
in
this
low
condition
he
pleaded
also
the
greatness
of
his
charge
the
greatness
of
taxes
the
badness
of
the
times
and
the
great
losses
that
he
had
by
many
of
his
customers
some
of
which
died
in
his
debt
others
were
run
away
and
for
many
that
were
alive
he
never
expected
a
farthi
n
g
from
them
yet
nevertheless
he
would
shew
himself
an
honest
man
and
would
pay
as
far
as
he
was
able
and
if
they
were
willing
to
come
to
terms
he
would
make
a
composition
with
them
for
he
was
not
able
to
pay
them
all
the
creditors
asked
what
he
would
give
twas
replyed
half
a
crown
in
the
pound
at
this
they
began
to
huff
and
he
to
renew
his
complaint
and
entreaty
but
the
creditors
would
not
hear
and
so
for
that
time
their
meeting
without
success
broke
up
but
after
his
creditors
were
in
cool
blood
and
admitting
of
second
thoughts
and
fearing
lest
delays
should
make
them
lose
all
they
admit
of
a
second
debate
come
together
again
and
by
many
words
and
great
ado
they
obtained
five
shillings
i
th
pound
so
the
money
was
produced
releases
and
discharges
drawn
signed
and
sealed
books
crossed
and
all
things
confirmed
and
then
badman
can
put
his
head
out
of
dores
again
and
be
a
better
man
than
when
he
shut
up
shop
by
several
thousands
of
pounds
atten
and
did
he
do
thus
indeed
wise
yes
once
and
again
i
think
he
brake
twice
or
thrice
atten
and
did
he
do
it
before
he
had
need
to
do
it
wise
need
what
do
you
mean
by
need
there
is
no
need
at
any
time
for
a
man
to
play
the
knave
he
did
it
of
a
wicked
mind
to
defraud
and
beguile
his
creditors
he
had
wherewithall
of
his
father
and
also
by
his
wife
to
have
lived
upon
with
lawfull
labour
like
an
honest
man
he
had
also
when
he
made
this
wicked
break
though
he
had
been
a
profuse
and
prodigal
spender
to
have
paid
his
creditors
their
own
to
a
farthing
but
had
he
done
so
he
had
not
done
like
himself
like
badman
had
he
i
say
dealt
like
an
honest
man
he
had
then
gone
out
of
badmans
road
he
did
it
therefore
of
a
dishonest
mind
and
to
a
wicked
end
to
wit
that
he
might
have
wherewithall
howsoever
unlawfully
gotten
to
follow
his
cups
and
queans
and
to
live
in
the
full
swinge
of
his
lusts
even
as
he
did
before
atten
why
this
was
a
meer
cheat
wise
it
was
a
cheat
indeed
this
way
of
breaking
it
is
else
but
a
more
neat
way
of
thieving
of
picking
of
pockets
of
breaking
open
of
shops
and
of
taking
from
men
what
one
has
nothing
to
do
with
but
though
it
seem
easie
it
is
hard
to
learn
no
man
that
has
conscience
to
god
or
man
can
ever
be
his
crafts
master
in
this
hellish
art
atten
oh
sirs
what
a
wicked
man
was
this
wise
a
wicked
man
indeed
by
this
art
he
could
tell
how
to
make
men
send
their
goods
to
his
shop
and
then
be
glad
to
take
a
penny
for
that
for
which
he
had
promised
before
it
came
thither
to
give
them
a
groat
i
say
he
could
make
them
glad
to
take
a
crown
for
a
pounds
worth
and
a
thousand
for
that
for
which
he
had
promised
before
to
give
them
four
thousand
pounds
atten
this
argueth
that
badman
had
but
little
conscience
wise
this
argued
that
badman
had
no
conscience
at
all
for
conscience
the
least
spark
of
a
good
conscience
can
not
endure
this
atten
before
we
go
any
further
in
badmans
matters
let
me
desire
you
if
you
please
to
give
me
an
answer
to
these
two
questions
what
do
you
find
in
the
word
of
god
against
such
a
practice
as
this
of
badmans
is
what
would
you
have
a
man
do
that
is
in
his
creditors
debt
and
can
neither
pay
him
what
be
owes
him
nor
go
on
in
a
trade
any
longer
wise
i
will
answer
you
as
well
as
i
can
and
first
to
the
first
of
your
questions
to
wit
what
i
find
in
the
word
of
god
against
such
a
practice
as
this
of
badmans
is
answ
the
word
of
god
doth
forbid
this
wickedness
and
to
make
it
the
more
odious
in
our
eyes
it
joyns
it
with
theft
and
robbery
thou
shalt
not
says
god
defraud
thy
neighbour
nor
rob
him
thou
shalt
not
defraud
that
is
deceive
or
beguile
now
thus
to
break
is
to
defraud
deceive
and
beguile
which
is
as
you
see
forbidden
by
the
god
of
heaven
thou
shalt
not
defraud
thy
neighbour
nor
rob
him
it
is
a
kind
of
theft
and
robbery
thus
to
defraud
and
beguile
it
is
a
wilely
robbing
of
his
shop
and
picking
of
his
pocket
a
thing
odious
to
reason
and
conscience
and
contrary
to
the
law
of
nature
it
is
a
designed
piece
of
wickedness
and
therefore
a
double
sin
a
man
can
not
do
this
great
wickedness
on
a
sudden
and
through
a
violent
assault
of
satan
he
that
will
commit
this
sin
must
have
time
to
deliberate
that
by
invention
he
may
make
it
formidable
and
that
with
lies
and
high
dissimulations
he
that
commits
this
wickedness
must
first
hatch
it
upon
his
bed
beat
his
head
about
it
and
lay
his
plot
strong
so
that
to
the
completing
of
such
a
wickedness
there
must
be
adjoyned
many
sins
and
they
too
must
go
hand
in
hand
untill
it
be
compleated
but
what
saith
the
scripture
let
no
man
go
beyond
and
defraud
his
brother
in
any
matter
because
the
lord
is
the
avenger
of
all
such
but
this
kind
of
breaking
is
a
going
beyond
my
brother
this
is
a
compassing
of
him
about
that
i
may
catch
him
in
my
net
and
as
i
said
an
art
to
rob
my
brother
and
to
pick
his
pocket
and
that
with
his
consent
which
doth
not
therefore
mitigate
but
so
much
the
more
greaten
and
make
odious
the
offence
for
men
that
are
thus
wilily
abused
can
not
help
themselves
they
are
taken
in
a
deceitfull
net
but
god
will
here
concern
himself
he
will
be
the
avenger
he
will
be
the
avenger
of
all
such
either
here
or
in
another
world
and
this
the
apostle
testifies
again
where
he
saith
but
he
that
doth
wrong
shall
receive
for
the
wrong
that
he
hath
done
and
there
is
no
respect
of
persons
that
is
there
is
no
man
be
he
what
he
will
if
he
will
be
guilty
of
this
sin
of
going
beyond
of
beguiling
of
and
doing
wrong
to
his
brother
but
god
will
call
him
to
an
account
for
it
and
will
pay
him
with
vengeance
for
it
too
for
there
is
no
respect
of
persons
i
might
add
that
this
sin
of
wronging
of
going
beyond
and
defrauding
of
my
neighbour
it
is
like
that
first
prank
that
the
devil
plaid
with
our
first
parents
as
the
altar
that
uriah
built
for
ahaz
was
taken
from
the
fashion
of
that
that
stood
at
damascus
to
be
the
very
pattern
of
it
the
serpent
beguiled
me
says
eve
badman
beguiles
his
creditors
the
serpent
beguiled
eve
with
lying
promises
of
gain
and
so
did
badman
beguile
his
creditors
the
serpent
said
one
thing
and
meant
another
when
he
beguiled
eve
and
so
did
badman
when
he
beguiled
his
creditors
that
man
therefore
that
doth
thus
deceive
and
beguile
his
neighbour
imitateth
the
devil
he
taketh
his
examples
from
him
and
not
from
god
the
word
or
good
men
and
this
did
badman
and
now
to
your
second
question
to
wit
what
i
would
have
a
man
do
that
is
in
his
creditors
debt
and
that
can
neither
pay
him
nor
go
on
in
a
trade
any
longer
answ
first
of
all
if
this
be
his
case
and
he
knows
it
let
him
not
run
one
penny
further
in
his
creditors
debt
for
that
can
not
be
done
with
good
conscience
he
that
knowes
he
can
not
pay
and
yet
will
run
into
debt
does
knowingly
wrong
and
defraud
his
neighbour
and
falls
under
that
sentence
of
the
word
of
god
the
wicked
borroweth
and
payeth
not
again
yea
worse
he
borrows
though
at
the
very
same
time
he
knows
that
he
can
not
pay
again
he
doth
also
craftily
take
away
what
is
his
neighbours
that
is
therefore
the
first
thing
that
i
would
propound
to
such
let
him
not
run
any
further
into
his
creditors
debt
secondly
after
this
let
him
consider
how
and
by
what
means
he
was
brought
into
such
a
condition
that
he
could
not
pay
his
just
debts
to
wit
whether
it
was
by
his
own
remisness
in
his
calling
by
living
too
high
in
dyet
or
apparel
by
lending
too
ravishingly
that
which
was
none
of
his
own
to
his
loss
or
whether
by
the
immediate
hand
and
judgment
of
god
if
by
searching
he
findes
that
this
is
come
upon
him
through
remisness
in
his
calling
extravagancies
in
his
family
or
the
like
let
him
labour
for
a
sence
of
his
sin
and
wickedness
for
he
has
sinned
against
the
lord
first
in
his
being
slothfull
in
business
and
in
not
providing
to
wit
of
is
own
by
the
sweat
of
his
brows
or
other
honest
ways
for
those
of
his
own
house
and
secondly
in
being
lavishing
in
dyet
and
apparel
in
the
family
or
in
lending
to
others
that
which
was
none
of
his
own
this
can
not
be
done
with
good
conscience
it
is
both
against
reason
and
nature
and
therefore
must
be
a
sin
against
god
i
say
therefore
if
thus
this
debtor
hath
done
if
ever
he
would
live
quietly
in
conscience
and
comfortably
in
his
condition
for
the
future
let
him
humble
himself
before
god
and
repent
of
this
his
wickedness
for
he
that
is
slothfull
in
his
work
is
brother
to
him
that
is
a
great
waster
to
be
slothfull
and
a
waster
too
is
to
be
as
it
were
a
double
sinner
but
again
as
this
man
should
enquire
into
these
things
so
he
should
also
into
this
how
came
i
into
this
way
of
dealing
in
which
i
have
now
miscarried
is
it
a
way
that
my
parents
brought
me
up
in
put
me
apprentice
to
or
that
by
providence
i
was
first
thrust
into
or
is
it
a
way
into
which
i
have
twisted
my
self
as
not
being
contented
with
my
first
lot
that
by
god
and
my
parents
i
was
cast
into
this
ought
duly
to
be
considered
and
if
upon
search
a
man
shall
find
that
he
is
out
of
the
place
and
calling
into
which
he
was
put
by
his
parents
or
the
providence
of
god
and
has
miscarried
in
a
new
way
that
through
pride
and
dislike
of
his
first
state
he
as
chose
rather
to
embrace
his
miscarriage
is
his
sin
the
fruit
of
his
pride
and
a
token
of
the
judgment
of
god
upon
him
for
his
leaving
of
his
first
state
and
for
this
he
ought
as
for
the
former
to
be
humble
and
penitent
before
the
lord
but
if
by
search
he
finds
that
his
poverty
came
by
none
of
these
if
by
honest
search
he
finds
it
so
and
can
say
with
good
conscience
i
went
not
out
of
my
place
and
state
in
which
god
by
his
providence
had
put
me
but
have
abode
with
god
in
the
calling
wherein
i
was
called
and
have
wrought
hard
and
fared
meanly
been
civilly
apparelled
and
have
not
directly
nor
indirectly
made
away
with
my
creditors
goods
then
has
his
fall
come
upon
him
by
the
immediate
hand
of
god
whether
by
visible
or
invisible
wayes
for
sometimes
it
comes
by
visible
wayes
to
wit
by
fire
by
thieves
by
loss
of
cattel
or
the
wickedness
of
sinful
dealers
and
sometimes
by
means
invisible
and
then
no
man
knows
how
we
only
see
things
are
going
but
can
not
see
by
what
way
they
go
well
now
suppose
that
a
man
by
an
immediate
hand
of
god
is
brought
to
a
morsel
of
bread
what
must
he
do
now
i
answer
his
surest
way
is
still
to
think
that
this
is
the
fruit
of
some
sin
though
possibly
not
sin
in
the
management
of
his
calling
yet
of
some
other
sin
god
casteth
away
the
substance
of
the
wicked
therefore
let
him
still
humble
himself
before
his
god
because
his
hand
is
upon
him
and
say
what
sin
is
this
for
which
this
hand
of
god
is
upon
me
and
let
him
be
diligent
to
find
it
out
for
some
sin
is
the
cause
of
this
judgment
for
god
doth
not
willingly
afflict
nor
grieve
the
children
of
men
either
the
heart
is
too
much
set
upon
the
world
or
religion
is
too
much
neglected
in
thy
family
or
some
thing
there
is
a
snake
in
the
grass
a
worm
in
the
gourd
some
sin
in
thy
bosom
for
the
sake
of
which
god
doth
thus
deal
with
thee
thirdly
this
thus
done
let
that
man
again
consider
thus
with
himself
perhaps
god
is
now
changing
of
my
condition
and
state
in
the
world
he
has
let
me
live
in
fashion
in
fulness
and
abundance
of
worldly
glory
and
i
did
not
to
his
glory
improve
as
i
should
that
his
good
dispensation
to
me
but
when
i
lived
in
full
and
fat
pasture
i
did
there
lift
up
the
heel
therefore
he
will
now
turn
me
into
hard
commons
that
with
leanness
and
hunger
and
meanness
and
want
i
may
spend
the
rest
of
my
days
but
let
him
do
this
without
murmering
and
repining
let
him
do
it
in
a
godly
manner
submitting
himself
to
the
judgment
of
god
let
the
rich
rejoyce
in
that
he
is
made
low
this
is
duty
and
it
may
be
priviledg
to
those
that
are
under
this
hand
of
god
and
for
thy
encouragement
to
this
hard
work
for
this
is
a
hard
work
consider
of
these
four
things
this
is
right
lying
down
under
gods
hand
and
the
way
to
be
exalted
in
gods
time
when
god
would
have
job
embrace
the
dunghill
he
embraces
it
and
says
the
lord
giveth
and
the
lord
hath
taken
away
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
lord
consider
that
there
are
blessings
also
that
attend
a
low
condition
more
than
all
the
world
are
aware
of
a
poor
condition
has
preventing
mercy
attending
of
it
the
poor
because
they
are
poor
are
not
capable
of
sinning
against
god
as
the
rich
man
does
the
poor
can
more
clearly
see
himself
preserved
by
the
providence
of
god
than
the
rich
for
he
trusteth
in
the
abundance
of
his
riches
it
may
be
god
has
made
thee
poor
because
he
would
make
thee
rich
hearken
my
beloved
brethren
hath
not
god
chosen
the
poor
of
this
world
rich
in
faith
and
heirs
of
a
kingdom
which
god
hath
promised
to
them
that
love
him
i
am
perswaded
if
men
upon
whom
this
hand
of
god
is
would
thus
quietly
lye
down
and
humble
themselves
under
it
they
would
find
more
peace
yea
more
blessing
of
god
attending
them
in
it
than
the
most
of
men
are
aware
of
but
this
is
an
hard
chapter
and
therefore
i
do
not
expect
that
many
should
either
read
it
with
pleasure
or
desire
to
take
my
counsel
having
thus
spoken
to
the
broken
man
with
reference
to
his
own
self
i
will
now
speak
to
him
as
he
stands
related
to
his
creditors
in
the
next
place
therefore
let
him
fall
upon
the
most
honest
way
of
dealing
with
his
creditors
and
that
i
think
must
be
this
first
let
him
timely
make
them
acquainted
with
his
condition
and
also
do
to
them
these
three
things
let
him
heartily
and
unfeignedly
ask
them
forgiveness
for
the
wrong
that
he
has
done
them
let
him
proffer
them
all
and
the
whole
all
that
ever
he
has
in
the
world
let
him
hide
nothing
let
him
strip
himself
to
his
raiment
for
them
let
him
not
keep
a
ring
a
spoon
or
any
thing
from
them
if
none
of
these
two
will
satisfie
them
let
him
proffer
them
his
body
to
be
at
their
dispose
to
wit
either
to
abide
imprisonment
their
pleasure
or
to
be
at
their
service
till
by
labour
and
travel
he
hath
made
them
such
amends
as
they
in
reason
think
fit
only
reserving
something
for
the
succour
of
his
poor
and
distressed
family
out
of
his
labour
which
in
reason
and
conscience
and
nature
he
is
bound
also
to
take
care
of
thus
shall
he
make
them
what
amends
he
is
able
for
the
wrong
that
he
hath
done
them
in
wasting
and
spending
of
their
estates
by
thus
doing
he
submits
himself
to
gods
rod
commits
himself
to
the
dispose
of
his
providence
yea
by
thus
doing
he
casteth
the
lot
of
his
present
and
future
condition
into
the
lap
of
his
creditors
and
leaves
the
whole
dispose
thereof
to
the
lord
even
as
he
shall
order
and
incline
their
hearts
to
do
with
him
and
let
that
be
either
to
forgive
him
or
to
take
that
which
he
hath
for
satisfaction
or
to
lay
his
body
under
affliction
this
way
or
that
according
to
law
can
he
i
say
thus
leave
the
whole
dispose
to
god
let
the
issue
be
what
it
will
that
man
shall
have
peace
in
his
mind
afterward
and
the
comforts
of
that
state
which
will
be
comforts
that
attend
equity
justice
and
duty
will
be
more
unto
him
because
more
according
to
godliness
than
can
be
the
comforts
that
are
the
fruits
of
injustice
fraudulency
and
deceit
besides
this
is
the
way
to
engage
god
to
favour
him
by
the
sentence
of
his
creditors
for
he
can
entreat
them
to
use
him
kindly
and
he
will
do
it
when
his
ways
are
pleasing
in
his
sight
when
a
mans
ways
please
the
lord
his
enemies
shall
be
at
peace
with
him
and
surely
for
a
man
to
seek
to
make
restitution
for
wrongs
done
to
the
utmost
of
his
power
by
what
he
is
has
and
enjoys
in
this
world
is
the
best
way
in
that
capacity
and
with
reference
to
that
thing
that
a
man
can
at
this
time
be
found
active
in
but
he
that
doth
otherwise
abides
in
his
sin
refuses
to
be
disposed
of
by
the
providence
of
god
chuseth
an
high
estate
though
not
attained
in
gods
way
when
gods
will
is
that
he
should
descend
into
a
low
one
yea
he
desperately
saith
in
his
heart
and
actions
i
will
be
mine
own
chooser
and
that
in
mine
own
way
whatever
happens
or
follows
thereupon
atten
you
have
said
well
in
my
mind
but
suppose
now
that
badman
was
here
could
he
not
object
as
to
what
you
have
said
saying
go
and
teach
your
brethren
that
are
professors
this
lesson
for
they
as
i
am
are
guilty
of
breaking
yea
i
am
apt
to
think
of
that
which
you
call
my
knavish
way
of
breaking
to
wit
of
breaking
before
they
have
need
to
break
but
if
not
so
yet
they
are
guilty
of
neglect
in
their
calling
of
living
higher
both
in
fare
and
apparrel
than
their
trade
or
income
will
maintain
besides
that
they
do
break
all
the
world
very
well
knowes
and
that
they
have
the
art
to
plead
for
a
composition
is
very
well
known
to
men
and
that
it
is
usual
with
them
to
hide
their
linnen
their
plate
their
jewels
and
tis
to
be
thought
sometimes
money
and
goods
besides
is
as
common
as
four
eggs
a
penny
and
thus
they
beguile
men
debauch
their
consciences
sin
against
their
profession
and
make
tis
to
be
feared
their
lusts
in
all
this
and
the
fulfilling
of
them
their
end
i
say
if
badman
was
here
to
object
thus
unto
you
what
would
be
your
reply
wise
what
why
i
would
say
i
hope
no
good
man
no
man
of
good
conscience
no
man
that
either
feareth
god
regardeth
the
credit
of
religion
the
peace
of
gods
people
or
the
salvation
of
his
own
soul
will
do
thus
professors
such
perhaps
there
may
be
and
who
upon
earth
can
help
it
jades
there
be
of
all
colours
if
men
will
profess
and
make
their
profession
a
to
beguile
their
neighbours
of
their
estates
as
badman
himself
did
when
he
beguiled
her
that
now
is
with
sorrow
his
wife
who
can
help
it
the
churches
of
old
were
pestered
with
such
and
therefore
no
marvel
if
these
perilous
difficult
times
be
so
but
mark
how
the
apostle
words
it
nay
do
wrong
and
defraud
and
that
your
brethren
know
you
not
that
the
unrighteous
shall
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
be
not
deceived
neither
fornicator
nor
idolaters
nor
adulterers
nor
effeminate
nor
abusers
of
themselves
with
mankind
nor
thieves
nor
covetous
nor
drunkards
nor
revilers
nor
extortioners
shall
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
none
of
these
shall
be
saved
in
this
state
nor
shall
profession
deliver
them
from
the
censure
of
the
godly
when
they
shall
be
manifest
such
to
be
but
their
profession
we
can
not
help
how
can
we
help
it
if
men
should
ascribe
to
themselves
the
title
of
holy
ones
godly
ones
zealous
ones
ones
or
any
other
such
glorious
title
and
while
they
thus
call
themselves
they
should
be
the
veryest
rogues
for
all
evil
sin
and
villany
imaginable
who
could
help
it
true
they
are
a
scandal
to
religion
a
grief
to
the
honest
hearted
an
offence
to
the
world
and
a
stumbling
stone
to
the
weak
and
these
offences
have
come
do
come
and
will
come
do
what
all
the
world
can
but
wo
be
to
them
through
whom
they
come
let
such
professors
therefore
disowned
by
all
true
christians
and
let
them
be
reckoned
among
those
base
men
of
the
world
which
by
such
actions
they
most
resemble
they
are
badmans
kindred
for
they
are
a
shame
to
religion
i
say
these
slithy
men
they
are
a
shame
to
religion
and
religious
men
should
be
ashamed
of
them
god
puts
such
an
one
among
the
fools
of
the
world
therefore
let
not
christians
put
them
among
those
that
are
wise
for
heaven
as
the
partridge
sitteth
on
eggs
and
hatcheth
them
not
so
he
that
getteth
riches
and
not
by
right
shall
leave
them
in
the
midst
of
his
dayes
and
at
his
end
shall
be
a
fool
and
the
man
under
consideration
is
one
of
these
and
therefore
must
look
to
fall
by
this
judgment
a
professor
and
practice
such
villianies
as
these
such
an
one
is
not
worthy
to
bear
that
name
any
longer
we
may
say
to
such
as
the
prophet
spake
to
their
like
to
wit
to
the
rebellious
that
were
in
the
house
of
israel
goe
ye
serve
every
man
his
idols
ye
will
not
hearken
to
the
law
and
testament
of
god
to
lead
your
lives
thereafter
but
pollute
gods
holy
name
no
more
with
your
gifts
and
with
your
idols
goe
professors
goe
leave
off
profession
unless
you
will
lead
your
lives
according
to
your
profession
better
never
profess
than
to
make
profession
a
to
sin
deceit
to
the
devil
and
hell
the
ground
and
rules
of
religion
allow
not
any
such
thing
receive
us
says
the
apostle
we
have
wronged
no
man
we
have
corrupted
no
man
we
have
defrauded
no
man
intimating
that
those
that
are
guilty
of
wronging
corrupting
or
defrauding
of
any
should
not
be
admitted
to
the
fellowship
of
saints
no
nor
into
the
common
catalogue
of
brethren
with
them
nor
can
men
with
all
their
rhetorick
and
eloquent
speaking
prove
themselves
fit
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
or
men
of
good
conscience
on
earth
o
that
godly
plea
of
samuel
behold
here
i
am
says
he
witness
against
me
before
the
lord
and
before
his
anointed
whose
oxe
have
i
taken
or
whose
ass
have
i
taken
or
whom
have
i
defrauded
whom
have
i
oppressed
c
this
was
to
do
like
a
man
of
good
conscience
indeed
and
in
this
his
appeal
he
was
so
justified
in
the
consciencies
of
the
whole
congregation
that
they
could
not
but
with
one
voice
as
with
one
mouth
break
out
joyntly
and
say
thou
hast
not
defrauded
us
nor
oppressed
us
a
professor
and
defraud
away
with
him
a
professor
should
not
owe
any
man
any
thing
but
love
a
professor
should
provide
things
not
of
other
mens
but
of
his
own
of
his
own
honest
getting
and
that
not
onely
in
the
sight
of
god
but
of
all
men
that
he
may
adorn
the
doctrine
if
god
our
saviour
in
all
things
atten
but
suppose
god
should
blow
upon
a
professor
in
his
estate
and
calling
and
he
should
be
run
out
before
he
is
aware
must
he
be
accounted
to
be
like
badman
and
lie
under
the
same
reproach
as
he
wise
no
if
he
hath
dutifully
done
what
he
could
to
avoid
it
it
is
possible
for
a
ship
to
sink
at
sea
notwithstanding
the
most
faithfull
endeavour
of
the
most
skilful
pilot
under
heaven
and
thus
as
i
suppose
it
was
with
the
prophet
that
left
his
wife
in
debt
to
the
hazarding
the
slavery
of
her
children
by
the
creditors
he
was
no
profuse
man
nor
one
that
was
given
to
defraud
for
the
text
says
he
feared
god
yet
as
i
said
he
was
run
out
more
than
she
could
pay
if
god
would
blow
upon
a
man
who
can
help
it
and
he
will
do
so
sometimes
because
he
will
change
dispensations
with
men
and
because
he
will
trye
their
graces
yea
also
because
he
will
overthrow
the
wicked
with
his
judgments
and
all
these
things
are
seen
in
job
but
then
the
consideration
of
this
should
bid
men
have
a
care
that
they
be
honest
lest
this
comes
upon
them
for
their
sin
it
should
also
bid
them
beware
of
launching
further
into
the
world
than
in
an
honest
way
by
ordinary
means
they
can
godlily
make
their
retreat
for
the
further
in
the
greater
fall
it
should
also
teach
them
to
begg
of
god
his
blessing
upon
their
endeavours
their
honest
and
lawfull
endeavours
and
it
should
put
them
upon
a
diligent
looking
to
their
steps
that
if
in
their
going
they
should
hear
the
ice
crack
they
may
timely
goe
back
again
these
things
considered
and
duely
put
in
practice
if
god
will
blow
upon
a
man
then
let
him
be
content
and
with
job
embrace
the
dunghill
let
him
give
unto
all
their
dues
and
not
fight
against
the
providence
of
god
but
humble
himself
rather
under
his
mighty
hand
which
comes
to
strip
him
naked
and
bare
for
he
that
doth
otherwise
fights
against
god
and
declares
that
he
is
a
stranger
to
that
of
paul
i
know
both
how
to
be
abased
and
i
know
how
to
abound
every
where
in
all
things
i
am
instructed
both
to
be
full
and
to
be
hungry
both
to
abound
and
to
suffer
need
atten
but
badman
would
not
i
believe
have
put
this
difference
twixt
things
feigned
and
those
that
fall
of
necessity
wise
if
he
will
not
god
will
conscience
will
and
that
not
thine
own
only
but
the
consciences
of
all
those
that
have
seen
the
way
and
that
have
known
the
truth
of
the
condition
of
such
an
one
atten
well
let
us
at
this
time
leave
this
matter
and
return
again
to
badman
wise
with
all
my
heart
will
i
proceed
to
give
you
a
relation
of
what
is
yet
behind
of
his
life
in
order
to
our
discourse
of
his
death
atten
but
pray
do
it
with
as
much
brevity
as
you
can
wise
why
are
you
a
weary
of
my
relating
of
things
atten
no
but
it
pleases
me
to
hear
a
great
deal
in
few
words
wise
i
profess
not
my
self
an
artist
that
way
but
yet
as
briefly
as
i
can
i
will
pass
through
what
of
his
life
is
behind
and
again
i
shall
begin
with
his
fraudulent
dealing
as
before
i
have
shewed
with
his
creditors
so
now
with
his
customers
and
those
that
he
had
otherwise
to
deal
withall
he
dealt
by
deceitfull
weights
and
measures
he
kept
weights
to
buy
by
and
weights
to
sell
by
measures
to
buy
by
and
measures
to
sell
by
those
he
bought
by
were
too
big
those
he
sold
by
were
too
little
besides
he
could
use
a
thing
called
slight
of
hand
if
he
had
to
do
with
other
mens
weights
and
measures
and
by
that
means
make
them
whether
he
did
buy
or
sell
yea
though
his
customer
or
chapman
looked
on
turn
to
his
own
advantage
moreover
he
had
the
art
to
misreckon
men
in
their
accounts
whether
by
weight
or
measure
or
money
and
would
often
do
it
to
his
worldly
advantage
and
their
loss
what
say
you
to
badman
now
and
if
a
question
was
made
of
his
faithfull
dealing
he
had
his
servants
ready
that
to
his
purpose
he
had
brought
up
that
would
avouch
and
swear
to
his
book
or
word
this
was
badmans
practice
what
think
you
of
badman
now
atten
think
why
i
can
think
no
other
but
that
he
was
a
man
left
to
himself
a
naughty
man
for
these
as
his
other
were
naughty
things
if
the
tree
as
indeed
it
may
ought
to
be
judged
what
it
is
by
its
fruits
then
badman
must
needs
be
a
bad
tree
but
pray
for
my
further
satisfaction
shew
me
now
by
the
word
of
god
evil
of
this
his
practice
and
first
of
his
using
false
weights
and
measures
wise
the
evil
of
that
why
the
evil
of
that
appears
to
every
eye
the
heathens
that
live
like
beasts
and
bruits
in
many
things
do
abominate
and
abhorr
such
wickedness
as
this
let
a
man
but
look
upon
these
things
as
he
goes
by
and
he
shall
see
enough
in
them
from
the
light
of
nature
to
make
him
loath
so
base
a
practice
although
badman
loved
it
atten
but
shew
me
something
out
of
the
word
against
it
will
you
wise
i
will
willingly
do
it
and
first
we
will
look
into
the
old
testament
you
shall
saith
god
there
do
no
unrighteousness
in
judgment
in
in
weights
or
in
measures
a
just
ballance
a
just
weight
a
just
ephah
and
a
just
hin
shall
you
have
this
is
the
law
of
god
and
that
which
all
men
according
to
the
law
of
the
land
ought
to
obey
so
again
ye
shall
have
just
ballances
and
a
just
ephah
now
having
shewed
you
the
law
i
will
also
shew
you
how
god
takes
swerving
therefrom
a
false
ballance
is
not
good
a
false
ballance
is
an
abomination
to
the
lord
some
have
just
weights
but
false
ballances
and
by
vertue
of
those
false
ballances
by
their
just
weights
they
deceive
the
countrey
wherefore
god
first
of
all
commands
that
the
ballance
be
made
just
a
just
ballance
shalt
thou
have
else
they
may
be
yea
are
decievers
notwithstanding
their
just
weights
now
having
commanded
that
men
have
a
just
ballance
and
testifying
that
a
false
one
is
an
abomination
to
the
lord
he
proceedeth
also
unto
weight
and
measure
thou
shalt
not
have
in
thy
bag
divers
weights
a
great
and
a
small
that
is
one
to
buy
by
and
another
to
sell
by
as
badman
had
thou
shalt
not
have
in
thy
house
divers
measures
a
great
and
a
small
and
these
had
badman
also
but
thou
shalt
have
a
perfect
and
a
just
weight
a
perfect
and
a
just
measure
shalt
thou
have
that
thy
days
may
be
lengthened
in
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
for
all
that
do
such
things
that
is
that
use
false
weights
and
measures
and
all
that
do
unrighteously
are
abomination
to
the
lord
see
now
both
how
plentiful
and
how
punctual
the
scripture
is
in
this
matter
but
perhaps
it
may
be
objected
that
all
this
is
old
law
and
therefore
hath
nothing
to
do
with
us
under
the
new
testament
not
that
i
think
you
neighbour
will
object
thus
well
to
this
foolish
objection
let
us
make
an
answer
first
he
that
makes
this
objection
if
he
doth
it
to
overthrow
the
authority
of
those
texts
discovereth
that
himself
is
first
cousen
to
badman
for
a
just
man
is
willing
to
speak
reverently
of
those
commands
that
man
therefore
hath
i
doubt
but
little
conscience
if
any
at
all
that
is
good
that
thus
objecteth
against
the
text
but
let
us
look
into
the
new
testament
and
there
we
shall
see
how
christ
confirmeth
the
same
where
he
commandeth
that
men
make
to
others
good
measure
including
also
that
they
make
good
weight
telling
such
that
doe
thus
or
those
that
do
it
not
that
they
may
be
encouraged
to
do
it
good
measure
pressed
down
shaken
together
and
running
over
shall
men
give
into
your
bosom
for
with
the
same
measure
that
ye
mete
withall
it
shall
be
measured
to
you
again
to
wit
both
from
god
and
man
for
as
god
will
shew
his
indignation
against
the
false
man
by
taking
away
even
that
he
hath
so
he
will
deliver
up
the
false
man
to
the
oppressor
and
the
extortioner
shall
catch
from
him
as
well
as
he
hath
catched
from
his
neighbour
therefore
another
scripture
saith
when
thou
shalt
cease
to
deal
treacherously
they
shall
deal
treacherously
with
thee
that
the
new
testament
also
hath
an
inspection
into
mens
trading
yea
even
with
their
weights
and
measures
is
evident
from
these
general
exhortations
defraud
not
lye
not
one
to
another
let
no
man
goe
beyond
his
brother
in
any
matter
for
god
is
the
avenger
of
all
such
whatsoever
you
do
do
it
heartily
as
unto
the
lord
doing
all
in
his
name
to
his
glory
and
the
like
all
these
injunctions
and
commandments
do
respect
our
life
and
conversation
among
men
with
reference
to
our
dealing
trading
and
so
consequently
they
forbid
false
deceitful
yea
all
doings
that
are
corrupt
having
thus
in
a
word
or
two
shewed
you
that
these
things
are
bad
i
will
next
for
the
conviction
of
those
that
use
them
shew
you
where
god
saith
they
are
to
be
found
they
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
house
of
the
good
and
godly
man
for
he
as
his
god
abhorrs
them
but
they
are
to
be
found
in
the
house
of
evil
doers
such
as
badmans
is
are
there
saith
the
prophet
yet
the
treasures
of
wickedness
in
the
house
of
the
wicked
and
the
scant
measure
that
is
abomination
are
they
there
yet
notwithstanding
gods
forbidding
notwithstanding
gods
tokens
of
anger
against
those
that
do
such
things
o
how
loth
is
a
wicked
man
to
let
goe
a
sweet
a
gainful
sin
when
he
hath
hold
of
it
they
hold
fast
deceit
they
refuse
to
let
it
goe
these
deceitful
weights
and
measures
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
house
of
the
mercifull
but
in
the
house
of
the
cruel
in
the
house
of
them
that
love
to
oppress
the
ballances
of
deceit
are
in
his
hand
he
loveth
to
oppress
he
is
given
to
oppression
and
cruelty
therefore
he
useth
such
wicked
things
in
his
calling
yea
he
is
a
very
cheat
and
as
was
hinted
before
concerning
badmans
breaking
so
i
say
now
concerning
his
using
these
deceitful
weights
and
measures
it
is
as
bad
as
base
as
to
take
a
purse
or
pick
a
pocket
for
it
is
a
plain
robbery
it
takes
away
from
a
man
that
which
is
his
own
even
the
price
of
his
money
the
deceitful
weights
and
measures
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
house
of
such
as
relieve
the
belly
and
that
cover
the
loyns
of
the
poor
but
of
such
as
indeed
would
swallow
them
up
hear
ye
this
ye
that
swallow
up
the
needy
and
that
make
the
poor
of
the
land
to
fail
saying
when
will
the
new
moon
be
gone
that
we
may
sell
corn
and
the
sabbath
that
we
may
set
forth
wheat
making
the
ephah
small
and
the
sheckle
great
making
the
measure
small
and
the
price
great
and
falsifying
the
ballances
by
deceit
that
ye
may
buy
the
poor
for
silver
and
the
needy
for
a
pair
of
shooes
and
sell
the
refuse
of
the
wheat
the
lord
hath
sworn
by
the
excellencie
of
jacob
surely
i
will
not
forget
any
of
their
works
so
detestable
and
vile
a
thing
is
this
in
the
sight
of
god
god
abominates
the
thoughts
of
calling
of
those
that
use
false
weights
and
measures
by
any
other
term
than
that
they
be
impure
ones
or
the
like
shall
i
count
them
pure
saith
he
with
the
bag
of
deceitful
weights
no
by
no
means
they
are
impure
ones
their
hands
are
defiled
deceitful
gain
is
in
their
houses
they
have
gotten
what
they
have
by
coveting
an
evil
covetousness
and
therefore
must
and
shall
be
counted
among
the
impure
among
the
wicked
of
the
world
thus
you
see
how
full
and
plain
the
word
of
god
is
against
this
sin
and
them
that
use
it
and
therefore
badman
for
that
he
used
by
these
things
thus
to
rook
and
cheat
his
neighbours
is
rightly
rejected
from
having
his
name
in
and
among
the
catalogue
of
the
godly
atten
but
i
am
perswaded
that
the
using
of
these
things
and
the
doing
by
them
thus
deceitfully
is
not
counted
so
great
an
evil
by
some
wise
whether
it
be
counted
an
evil
or
a
vertue
by
men
it
mattereth
not
you
see
by
the
scriptures
the
judgment
of
god
upon
it
it
was
not
counted
an
evil
by
badman
nor
is
it
by
any
that
still
are
treading
in
his
steps
but
i
say
tis
no
matter
how
men
esteem
of
things
let
us
adhere
to
the
judgment
of
god
and
the
rather
because
when
we
our
selves
have
done
weighing
and
measuring
to
others
then
god
will
weigh
and
measure
both
us
and
our
actions
and
when
he
doth
so
as
he
will
do
shortly
then
wo
be
to
him
to
whom
and
of
whose
actions
it
shall
be
thus
said
by
him
tekel
thou
art
weighed
in
the
ballances
and
art
found
wanting
god
will
then
recompense
their
evil
of
deceiving
upon
their
own
head
when
he
shall
shut
them
out
of
his
presence
favour
and
kingdom
for
ever
and
ever
atten
but
tis
a
wonder
that
since
badmans
common
practice
was
to
do
thus
that
some
one
or
more
did
not
find
him
out
and
blame
him
for
this
his
wickedness
wise
for
the
generality
of
people
he
went
away
clever
with
his
knavery
for
what
with
his
ballance
his
false
ballance
and
good
weight
and
what
with
his
slight
of
hand
to
boot
he
beguiled
sometimes
a
little
and
sometimes
more
most
that
he
had
to
deal
with
besides
those
that
use
this
naughty
trade
are
either
such
as
blind
men
with
a
shew
of
religion
or
by
hectoring
the
buyer
out
by
words
i
must
confess
badman
was
not
so
arch
at
the
first
that
is
to
do
it
by
shew
of
religion
for
now
he
began
to
grow
threadbare
though
some
of
his
brethren
are
arch
enough
this
way
yea
and
of
his
sisters
too
for
i
told
you
at
first
that
there
was
a
great
many
of
them
and
of
them
good
but
for
hectoring
for
swearing
for
lying
if
these
things
would
make
weight
and
measure
they
should
not
be
wanting
to
badmans
customers
atten
then
it
seem
he
kept
good
weights
and
a
bad
ballance
well
that
was
better
than
that
both
should
be
bad
wise
not
at
all
there
lay
the
depth
of
his
deceit
for
if
any
at
any
time
found
fault
that
he
used
them
hardly
and
that
they
wanted
their
weight
of
things
he
would
reply
why
did
you
not
see
them
weighed
will
you
not
believe
your
own
eyes
if
you
question
my
weights
pray
carry
them
whether
you
will
i
will
maintain
them
to
be
good
and
just
the
same
he
would
say
of
his
scales
so
he
blinded
all
by
his
ballance
atten
this
is
cunning
indeed
but
as
you
say
there
must
be
also
something
done
or
said
to
blind
therewith
and
this
i
perceive
badman
had
wise
yes
he
had
many
ways
to
blind
but
he
was
never
clever
at
it
by
making
a
shew
of
religion
though
he
cheated
his
wife
therewith
for
he
was
especially
by
those
that
dwelt
near
him
too
well
known
to
do
that
though
he
would
bungle
at
it
as
well
as
he
could
but
there
are
some
that
are
arch
villains
this
way
they
shall
to
view
live
a
whole
life
religiously
and
yet
shall
be
guilty
of
these
most
horrible
sins
and
yet
religion
in
it
self
is
never
the
worse
nor
yet
the
true
professors
of
it
but
as
luther
says
in
the
name
of
god
begins
all
mischief
for
hypocrites
have
no
other
way
to
bring
their
evils
to
maturity
but
by
using
and
mixing
the
name
of
god
and
religion
therewith
thus
they
become
whited
walls
for
by
this
white
the
white
of
religion
the
dirt
of
their
actions
is
hid
thus
also
they
become
graves
that
appear
not
and
they
that
goe
over
them
that
have
to
do
with
them
are
not
aware
of
them
but
suffer
themselves
to
be
deluded
by
them
yea
if
there
shall
as
there
will
sometimes
rise
a
doubt
in
the
heart
of
the
buyer
about
the
weight
and
measure
he
should
have
why
he
suffereth
his
very
sences
to
be
also
deluded
by
recalling
of
his
chapmans
religion
to
mind
and
thinks
verily
that
not
his
good
chapman
but
himself
is
out
for
he
dreams
not
that
his
chapman
can
deceive
but
if
the
buyer
shall
find
it
out
and
shall
make
it
apparent
that
he
is
beguiled
then
shall
he
be
healed
by
having
amends
made
and
perhaps
fault
shall
be
laid
upon
servants
and
so
master
cheat
shall
stand
for
a
right
honest
man
in
the
eye
of
his
customer
though
the
next
time
he
shall
pick
his
pocket
again
some
plead
custom
for
their
cheat
as
if
that
could
acquit
them
before
the
tribunal
of
god
and
others
say
it
came
to
them
for
so
much
and
therefore
another
must
take
it
for
so
much
though
there
is
wanting
both
as
to
weight
and
measure
but
in
all
these
things
there
are
juggles
or
if
not
such
must
know
that
that
which
is
altogether
just
they
must
doe
suppose
that
i
be
cheated
my
self
with
a
brass
must
i
therefore
cheat
another
therewith
if
this
be
bad
in
the
whole
it
is
also
bad
in
the
parts
therefore
however
thou
are
dealt
withall
in
thy
buying
yet
thou
must
deal
justly
in
selling
or
thou
sinnest
against
thy
soul
and
art
become
as
badman
and
know
that
a
pretence
to
custom
is
nothing
worth
tis
not
custom
but
good
conscience
that
will
help
at
gods
tribunal
atten
but
i
am
perswaded
that
that
which
is
gotten
by
men
this
way
doth
them
but
little
good
wise
i
am
of
your
mind
for
that
but
this
is
not
considered
by
those
thus
minded
for
if
they
can
get
it
though
they
get
as
we
say
the
devil
and
all
by
their
getting
yet
they
are
content
and
count
that
their
getting
is
much
little
good
why
do
you
think
they
consider
that
no
no
more
than
they
consider
what
they
shall
doe
in
the
judgment
at
the
day
of
god
almighty
for
their
wrong
getting
of
what
they
get
and
that
is
just
nothing
at
all
but
to
give
you
a
more
direct
answer
this
kind
of
getting
is
so
far
off
from
doing
them
little
good
that
it
doth
them
no
good
at
all
because
thereby
they
lose
their
own
souls
what
shall
it
profit
a
man
if
he
shall
gain
the
whole
world
and
lose
his
own
soul
he
loseth
then
he
loseth
greatly
that
getteth
after
this
fashion
this
is
the
man
that
is
and
this
is
he
that
loseth
his
good
sheep
for
a
halfpennyworth
of
tarr
that
loseth
a
soul
for
a
little
of
the
world
and
then
what
doth
he
get
thereby
but
loss
and
dammage
thus
he
getteth
or
rather
loseth
about
the
world
to
come
but
what
doth
he
get
in
this
world
more
than
travel
and
sorrow
vexation
of
spirit
and
disappointment
men
aim
at
blessedness
in
getting
i
mean
at
temporal
blessedness
but
the
man
that
thus
getteth
shall
not
have
that
for
though
an
inheritance
after
this
manner
may
be
hastily
gotten
at
the
beginning
yet
the
end
thereof
shall
not
be
blessed
they
gather
it
indeed
and
think
to
keep
it
too
but
what
says
solomon
god
casteth
it
away
the
lord
will
not
suffer
the
soul
of
the
righteous
to
famish
but
he
casteth
away
the
substance
of
the
wicked
the
time
as
i
said
that
they
do
enjoy
it
it
shall
doe
them
no
good
at
all
but
long
to
be
sure
they
must
not
have
it
for
god
will
either
take
it
away
in
their
life
time
or
else
in
the
generation
following
according
to
that
of
job
he
the
wicked
may
prepare
it
but
the
just
shall
put
it
on
and
the
innocent
shall
divide
the
silver
consider
that
also
that
is
written
in
the
proverbs
a
good
man
leaveth
an
inheritance
to
his
childrens
children
and
the
wealth
of
the
sinner
is
laid
up
for
the
just
what
then
doth
he
get
thereby
that
getteth
by
dishonest
means
why
he
getteth
sin
and
wrath
hell
and
damnation
and
now
tell
me
how
much
he
doth
get
this
i
say
is
his
getting
so
that
as
david
says
we
may
be
bold
to
say
too
i
beheld
the
wicked
in
great
prosperity
and
presently
i
cursed
his
habitation
for
it
can
not
prosper
with
him
fluster
and
huff
and
make
a
doe
for
a
while
he
may
but
god
hath
determined
that
both
he
and
it
shall
melt
like
grease
and
any
observing
man
may
see
it
so
behold
the
unrighteous
man
in
a
way
of
injustice
getteth
much
and
loadeth
himself
with
thick
clay
but
anon
it
withereth
it
decayeth
and
even
he
or
the
generation
following
decline
and
return
to
beggery
and
this
badman
notwithstanding
his
cunning
and
crafty
tricks
to
get
money
did
dye
no
body
can
tell
whether
worth
a
farthing
or
no
atten
he
had
all
the
bad
tricks
i
think
that
it
was
possible
for
a
man
to
have
to
get
money
one
would
think
that
he
should
a
been
rich
wise
you
reckon
too
fast
if
you
count
these
all
his
bad
tricks
to
get
money
for
he
had
more
besides
if
his
customers
were
in
his
books
as
it
should
goe
hard
but
he
would
have
them
there
at
least
if
he
thought
he
could
make
any
advantage
of
them
then
then
would
he
be
sure
to
impose
upon
them
his
worst
even
very
bad
comodity
yet
set
down
for
it
the
price
that
the
best
was
sold
at
like
those
that
sold
the
refuse
wheat
or
the
worst
of
the
wheat
making
the
sheckle
great
yet
hoisting
up
the
price
this
was
badmans
way
he
would
sell
goods
that
cost
him
not
the
best
price
by
far
for
as
much
as
he
sold
the
best
of
all
for
he
had
also
a
trick
to
mingle
his
comodity
that
that
which
was
bad
might
goe
off
with
the
less
mistrust
besides
if
his
customers
at
any
time
paid
him
money
let
them
look
to
themselves
and
to
their
acquitances
for
he
would
usually
attempt
to
call
for
that
payment
again
specially
if
he
thought
that
there
was
hopes
of
making
a
prize
thereby
and
then
to
be
sure
if
they
could
not
produce
good
and
sufficient
ground
of
the
payment
a
hundred
to
one
but
they
payed
it
again
sometimes
the
honest
chapman
would
appeal
to
his
servants
for
proof
of
the
payment
of
money
but
they
were
trained
up
by
him
to
say
after
his
mind
right
or
wrong
so
that
relief
that
way
he
could
get
none
atten
it
is
a
bad
yea
an
abominable
thing
for
a
man
to
have
such
servants
for
by
such
means
a
poor
customer
may
be
undone
and
not
know
how
to
help
himself
alas
if
the
master
be
so
unconscionable
as
i
perceive
badman
was
to
call
for
his
money
twice
and
if
his
servant
will
swear
that
it
is
a
due
debt
where
is
any
help
for
such
a
man
he
must
sink
there
is
no
remedy
wise
this
is
very
bad
but
this
has
been
a
practice
and
that
hundreds
of
years
agoe
but
what
saith
the
word
of
god
i
will
punish
all
those
that
leap
upon
the
threshold
which
fill
their
masters
houses
with
violence
and
deceit
badman
also
had
this
art
could
he
get
a
man
at
advantage
that
is
if
his
chapman
durst
not
go
from
him
or
if
the
comodity
he
wanted
could
not
for
the
present
be
conveniently
had
elsewhere
then
let
him
look
to
himself
he
would
surely
make
his
crack
he
would
exact
upon
him
without
any
pity
or
conscience
atten
that
was
extortion
was
it
not
i
pray
let
me
hear
your
judgment
of
extortion
what
it
is
and
when
committed
wise
extortion
is
a
screwing
from
men
more
than
by
the
law
of
god
or
men
is
right
and
it
is
committed
sometimes
by
them
in
office
about
fees
rewards
and
the
like
but
tis
most
commonly
committed
by
men
of
trade
who
without
all
conscience
when
they
have
the
advantage
will
make
a
prey
of
their
neighbour
and
thus
was
badman
an
extortioner
for
although
he
did
not
exact
and
force
away
as
bailifs
and
clarks
have
used
to
doe
yet
he
had
his
opportunities
and
such
cruelty
to
make
use
of
them
that
he
would
often
in
his
way
be
extorting
and
forcing
of
money
out
of
his
neighbours
pocket
for
every
man
that
makes
a
prey
of
his
advantage
upon
his
neighbours
necessities
to
force
from
him
more
than
in
reason
and
conscience
according
to
the
present
prizes
of
things
such
comodity
is
worth
may
very
well
be
called
an
extortioner
and
judged
for
one
that
hath
no
inheritance
in
the
kingdom
of
god
atten
well
this
badman
was
a
sad
wretch
wise
thus
you
have
often
said
before
but
now
we
are
in
discourse
of
this
give
me
leave
a
little
to
goe
on
we
have
a
great
many
people
in
the
countrey
too
that
live
all
their
dayes
in
the
practice
and
so
under
the
guilt
of
extortion
people
alas
that
think
scorn
to
be
so
accounted
as
for
example
there
is
a
poor
body
that
dwells
we
will
suppose
so
many
miles
from
the
market
and
this
man
wants
a
bushel
of
grist
a
pound
of
butter
or
a
cheese
for
himself
his
wife
and
poor
children
but
dwelling
so
far
from
the
market
if
he
goes
thither
he
shall
lose
his
dayes
work
which
will
be
eight
pence
or
ten
pence
dammage
to
him
and
that
is
something
to
a
poor
man
so
he
goeth
to
one
of
his
masters
or
dames
for
what
he
wanteth
and
asks
them
to
help
him
with
such
a
thing
yes
say
they
you
may
have
it
but
withall
they
will
give
him
a
gripe
perhaps
make
him
pay
as
much
or
more
for
it
at
home
as
they
can
get
when
they
have
carryed
it
five
miles
to
a
market
yea
and
that
too
for
the
refuse
of
their
commodity
but
in
this
the
women
are
especially
faulty
in
the
sale
of
their
butter
and
cheese
now
this
is
a
kind
of
extortion
it
is
a
making
a
prey
of
the
necessity
of
the
poor
it
is
a
grinding
of
their
faces
a
buying
and
selling
of
them
but
above
all
your
hucksters
that
buy
up
the
poor
mans
victuals
by
and
sell
it
to
him
again
for
unreasonable
gains
by
retale
and
as
we
call
it
by
piece
meal
they
are
got
into
a
way
after
a
stingeing
rate
to
play
their
game
upon
such
by
extortion
i
mean
such
who
buy
up
butter
cheese
eggs
bacon
by
whole
sale
and
sell
it
again
as
they
call
it
by
penny
worths
two
penny
worths
a
half
penny
worth
or
the
like
to
the
poor
all
the
week
after
the
market
is
past
these
though
i
will
not
condemn
them
all
do
many
of
them
bite
and
pinch
the
poor
by
this
kind
of
evil
dealing
these
destroy
the
poor
because
he
is
poor
and
that
is
a
grievous
sin
he
that
oppresseth
the
poor
to
increase
his
riches
and
that
giveth
to
the
rich
shall
surely
come
to
want
therefore
he
saith
again
rob
not
the
poor
because
he
is
poor
neither
oppress
the
afflicted
in
the
gate
for
the
lord
will
plead
their
cause
and
spoil
the
soul
of
them
that
spoile
them
oh
that
he
that
gripeth
and
grindeth
the
face
of
the
poor
would
take
notice
of
these
two
scriptures
here
is
threatned
the
destruction
of
the
estate
yea
and
of
the
soul
too
of
them
that
oppress
the
poor
their
soul
we
shall
better
see
where
and
in
what
condition
that
is
in
when
the
day
of
doom
is
come
but
for
the
estates
of
such
they
usually
quickly
moulter
and
that
sometimes
all
men
and
sometimes
no
man
knows
how
besides
these
are
usurers
yea
they
take
usury
for
victuals
which
thing
the
lord
has
forbidden
and
because
they
can
not
so
well
do
it
on
the
therefore
they
do
it
as
i
said
when
the
market
is
over
for
then
the
poor
falls
into
their
mouths
and
are
necessitated
to
have
as
they
can
for
their
need
and
they
are
resolved
they
shall
pay
soundly
for
it
perhaps
some
will
find
fault
for
my
medling
thus
with
other
folks
matters
and
for
my
thus
prying
into
the
secrets
of
their
iniquity
but
to
such
i
would
say
since
such
actions
are
evil
tis
time
they
were
hissed
out
of
the
world
for
all
that
doe
such
things
offend
against
god
wrong
their
neighbour
and
like
badman
doe
provoke
god
to
judgment
god
knows
there
is
abundance
of
deceit
in
the
world
wise
deceit
aie
but
i
have
not
told
you
the
thousandth
part
of
it
nor
is
it
my
business
now
to
rake
to
the
bottom
of
that
dunghill
what
would
you
say
if
i
should
anatomize
some
of
those
vile
wretches
called
that
lend
money
and
goods
to
poor
people
who
are
by
necessity
forced
to
such
an
inconvenience
and
will
make
by
one
trick
or
other
the
interest
of
what
they
so
lend
amount
to
thirty
forty
yea
sometimes
fifty
pound
by
the
year
nothwithstanding
the
principal
is
secured
by
a
sufficient
pawn
which
they
will
keep
too
at
last
if
they
can
find
any
shift
to
cheat
the
wretched
borrower
atten
say
why
such
miscreants
are
the
pest
and
vermin
of
the
not
fit
for
the
society
of
men
but
methinks
by
some
of
those
things
you
discoursed
before
you
seem
to
import
that
it
is
not
lawful
for
a
man
to
make
the
best
of
his
own
wise
if
by
making
the
best
you
mean
to
sell
for
as
much
as
by
hook
or
crook
he
can
get
for
his
comodity
then
i
say
it
is
not
lawful
and
if
i
should
say
the
contrary
i
should
justifie
badman
and
all
the
rest
of
that
gang
but
that
i
never
shall
doe
for
the
word
of
god
condemns
them
but
that
it
is
not
lawful
for
a
man
at
all
times
to
sell
his
commodity
for
as
much
as
he
can
i
prove
by
these
reasons
first
if
it
be
lawful
for
me
alway
to
sell
my
commodity
as
dear
or
for
as
much
as
i
can
then
tis
lawful
for
me
to
lay
aside
in
my
dealing
with
others
good
conscience
to
them
and
to
god
but
it
is
not
lawful
for
me
in
my
dealing
with
others
to
lay
aside
good
conscience
therefore
it
is
not
lawful
for
me
always
to
sell
my
commodity
as
dear
or
for
as
much
as
i
can
that
it
is
not
lawful
to
lay
aside
good
conscience
in
our
dealings
has
already
been
proved
in
the
former
part
of
our
discourse
but
that
a
man
must
lay
it
aside
that
will
sell
his
commodity
always
as
dear
or
for
as
much
as
he
can
is
plainly
manifest
thus
he
that
will
as
is
mentioned
afore
sell
his
commodity
as
dear
as
he
can
must
sometimes
make
a
prey
of
the
ignorance
of
his
chapman
but
that
he
can
not
doe
with
a
good
conscience
for
that
is
to
overreach
and
to
goe
beyond
my
chapman
and
is
forbidden
thess
therefore
he
that
will
sell
his
commodity
as
afore
as
dear
or
for
as
much
as
he
can
must
of
necessity
lay
aside
good
conscience
he
that
will
sell
his
commodity
always
as
dear
as
he
can
must
needs
sometimes
make
a
prey
of
his
neighbours
necessity
but
that
he
can
not
doe
with
a
good
conscience
for
that
is
to
goe
beyond
and
defraud
his
neighbour
contrary
to
thess
therefore
he
that
will
sell
his
commodity
as
afore
as
dear
or
for
as
much
as
he
can
must
needs
cast
off
and
lay
aside
a
good
conscience
he
that
will
as
afore
sell
his
commodity
as
dear
or
for
as
much
as
he
can
must
if
need
be
make
a
prey
of
his
neighbours
fondness
but
that
a
man
can
not
doe
with
a
good
conscience
for
that
is
still
a
going
beyond
him
contrary
to
thess
therefore
he
that
will
sell
his
commodity
as
dear
or
for
as
much
as
he
can
must
needs
cast
off
and
lay
aside
good
conscience
the
same
also
may
be
said
for
buying
no
man
may
always
buy
as
cheap
as
he
can
but
must
also
use
good
conscience
in
buying
the
which
he
can
by
no
means
use
and
keep
if
he
buyes
always
as
cheap
as
he
can
and
that
for
the
reasons
urged
before
for
such
will
make
a
prey
of
the
ignorance
necessity
and
fondness
of
their
chapman
the
which
they
can
not
doe
with
a
good
consceince
when
abraham
would
buy
a
of
the
sons
of
heth
thus
he
said
unto
them
intreat
for
me
to
ephron
the
son
of
zohar
that
he
may
give
me
the
cave
of
machpelah
which
he
hath
in
the
end
his
field
for
as
much
as
it
is
worth
shall
he
give
it
me
he
would
not
have
it
under
foot
he
scorned
it
he
abhored
it
it
stood
not
with
his
religion
credit
nor
conscience
so
also
when
david
would
buy
a
field
of
ornon
the
jebusite
thus
he
said
unto
him
grant
me
the
place
the
that
i
may
build
an
altar
there
unto
the
lord
thou
shalt
give
it
me
for
the
full
price
he
also
as
abraham
made
conscience
of
this
kind
of
dealing
he
would
not
lie
at
catch
to
go
beyond
no
not
the
jebusite
but
will
give
him
his
full
price
for
his
field
for
he
knew
that
there
was
wickedness
as
in
selling
too
dear
so
in
buying
too
cheap
therefore
he
would
not
do
it
there
ought
therefore
to
be
good
conscience
used
as
in
selling
so
in
buying
for
tis
also
unlawful
for
a
man
to
goe
beyond
or
to
defraud
his
neighbour
in
buying
yea
tis
unlawful
to
doe
it
in
any
matter
and
god
will
plentifully
avenge
that
wrong
as
i
also
before
have
forewarned
and
testified
see
also
the
text
in
the
margent
but
secondly
if
it
be
lawful
for
me
always
to
sell
my
commodity
as
dear
or
for
as
much
as
i
can
then
it
is
lawful
for
me
to
deal
with
my
neighbour
without
the
use
of
charity
but
it
is
not
lawful
for
me
to
lay
aside
or
to
deal
with
my
neighbour
without
the
use
of
charity
therefore
it
is
not
lawful
for
me
always
to
sell
my
commodity
to
my
neighbour
for
as
much
as
i
can
a
man
in
dealing
should
as
really
design
his
neighbours
good
profit
and
advantage
as
his
own
for
this
is
to
exercise
charity
in
his
dealing
that
i
should
thus
use
or
exercise
charity
towards
my
neighbour
in
my
buying
and
selling
with
him
is
evident
from
the
general
command
let
all
your
things
be
done
in
charity
but
that
a
man
can
not
live
in
the
exercise
of
charity
that
selleth
as
afore
as
dear
or
that
buyeth
as
cheap
as
he
can
is
evident
by
these
reasons
he
that
sells
his
commodity
as
dear
or
for
as
much
money
always
as
he
can
seeks
himself
and
himself
only
but
charity
seeketh
not
her
own
nor
her
own
only
so
then
he
that
seeks
himself
and
himself
onely
as
he
that
sells
as
afore
as
dear
as
he
can
does
maketh
not
use
of
nor
doth
he
exercise
charity
in
his
so
dealing
he
that
selleth
his
commodity
always
for
as
much
as
he
can
get
hardeneth
his
heart
against
all
reasonable
entreaties
of
the
buyer
but
he
that
doth
so
can
not
exercise
charity
in
his
dealing
therefore
it
is
not
lawful
for
a
man
to
sell
his
commodity
as
afore
as
dear
as
he
can
thirdly
if
it
be
lawful
for
me
to
sell
my
commodity
as
afore
as
dear
as
i
can
then
there
can
be
no
sin
in
my
trading
how
unreasonably
soever
i
manage
my
calling
whether
by
lying
swearing
cursing
cheating
for
all
this
is
but
to
sell
my
commodity
as
dear
as
i
can
but
that
there
is
sin
in
these
is
evident
therefore
i
may
not
sell
my
commodity
always
as
dear
as
i
can
fourthly
he
that
sells
as
afore
as
dear
as
he
can
offereth
violence
to
the
law
of
nature
for
that
saith
doe
unto
all
men
even
as
ye
would
that
they
should
doe
unto
you
now
was
the
seller
a
buyer
he
would
not
that
he
of
whom
he
buyes
should
sell
him
always
as
dear
as
he
can
therefore
he
should
not
sell
so
himself
when
it
is
his
lot
to
sell
and
others
to
buy
of
him
fifthly
he
that
selleth
as
afore
as
dear
as
he
can
makes
use
of
that
instruction
that
god
hath
not
given
to
others
but
sealed
up
in
his
hand
to
abuse
his
law
and
to
wrong
his
neighbour
withall
which
indeed
is
contrary
to
god
god
hath
given
thee
more
skill
more
knowledge
and
understanding
in
thy
commodity
than
he
hath
given
to
him
that
would
buy
of
thee
but
what
canst
thou
think
that
god
has
given
thee
this
that
thou
mightest
thereby
make
a
prey
of
thy
neighbour
that
thou
mightest
thereby
goe
beyond
and
beguile
thy
neighbour
no
verily
but
he
hath
given
thee
it
for
his
help
that
thou
mightest
in
this
be
eyes
to
the
blind
and
save
thy
neighbour
from
that
dammage
that
his
ignorance
or
necessity
or
fondness
would
betray
him
into
the
hands
of
sixthly
in
all
that
a
man
does
he
should
have
an
eye
to
the
glory
of
god
but
that
he
can
not
have
that
sells
his
commodity
always
for
as
much
as
he
can
for
the
reasons
urged
before
seventhly
all
that
a
man
does
he
should
doe
in
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
that
is
as
being
commanded
and
authorized
to
doe
it
by
him
but
he
that
selleth
always
as
dear
as
he
can
can
not
so
much
as
pretend
to
this
without
horrid
blaspheming
of
that
name
because
commanded
by
him
to
doe
otherwise
eightly
and
lastly
in
all
that
a
man
does
he
should
have
an
eye
to
the
day
of
judgment
and
to
the
consideration
of
how
his
actions
will
be
esteemed
of
in
that
day
therefore
there
is
not
any
man
can
or
ought
to
sell
always
as
dear
as
he
can
unless
he
will
yea
he
must
say
in
so
doing
i
will
run
the
hazard
of
the
tryal
of
that
day
if
thou
sell
ought
unto
thy
neighbour
or
buyest
ought
of
thy
neighbour
ye
shall
not
oppress
one
another
atten
but
why
doe
you
put
in
those
cautionary
words
they
must
not
sell
always
as
dear
nor
buy
always
as
cheap
as
they
can
doe
you
not
thereby
intimate
that
a
man
may
sometimes
do
so
wise
i
doe
indeed
intimate
that
somtimes
the
seller
may
sell
as
dear
and
the
buyer
buy
as
cheap
as
he
can
but
this
is
allowable
only
in
these
cases
when
he
that
sells
is
a
knave
and
lays
aside
all
good
conscience
in
selling
or
when
the
buyer
is
a
knave
and
layes
aside
all
good
conscience
in
buying
if
the
buyer
therefore
lights
of
a
knave
or
if
the
seller
lights
of
a
knave
then
let
them
look
to
themselves
but
yet
so
as
not
to
lay
aside
conscience
because
he
that
thou
dearest
with
doth
so
but
how
vile
or
base
soever
the
chapman
is
do
thou
keep
thy
commodity
at
a
reasonable
price
or
if
thou
buyest
offer
reasonable
gain
for
the
thing
thou
wouldest
have
and
if
this
will
not
do
with
the
buyer
or
seller
then
seek
thee
a
more
honest
chapman
if
thou
objectest
but
i
have
not
skil
to
know
when
a
pennyworth
is
before
me
get
some
that
have
more
skill
than
thy
self
in
that
affair
and
let
them
in
that
matter
dispose
of
thy
money
but
if
there
were
no
knaves
in
the
world
these
objections
need
not
be
made
and
thus
my
very
good
neighbour
have
i
given
you
a
few
of
my
reasons
why
a
man
that
hath
it
should
not
always
sell
too
dear
nor
buy
as
cheap
as
he
can
but
should
use
good
conscience
to
god
and
charity
to
his
neighbour
in
both
atten
but
were
some
men
here
to
hear
you
i
believe
they
would
laugh
you
to
scorn
wise
i
question
not
that
at
all
for
so
badman
used
to
doe
when
any
man
told
him
of
his
faults
he
used
to
think
himself
wiser
than
any
and
would
count
as
i
have
hinted
before
that
he
was
not
arrived
to
a
manly
spirit
that
did
stick
or
boggle
at
any
wickedness
but
let
badman
and
his
fellowes
laugh
i
will
bear
it
and
still
give
them
good
counsel
but
i
will
remember
also
for
my
further
relief
and
comfort
that
thus
they
that
were
covetous
of
old
served
the
son
of
god
himself
it
is
their
time
to
laugh
now
that
they
may
mourn
in
time
to
come
and
i
say
again
when
they
have
laughed
out
their
laugh
he
that
useth
not
good
conscience
to
god
and
charity
to
his
neighbour
in
buying
and
selling
dwells
next
dore
to
an
infidel
and
is
near
of
kin
to
badman
atten
well
but
what
will
you
say
to
this
question
you
know
that
there
is
no
settled
price
set
by
god
upon
any
commodity
that
is
bought
or
sold
under
the
sun
but
all
things
that
we
buy
and
sell
do
ebbe
and
flow
as
to
price
like
the
tide
how
then
shall
a
man
of
a
tender
conscience
doe
neither
to
wrong
the
seller
buyer
nor
himself
in
buying
and
selling
of
commodities
wise
this
question
is
thought
to
be
frivolous
by
all
that
are
of
badmans
way
tis
also
difficult
in
it
self
yet
i
will
endeavour
to
shape
you
an
answer
and
that
first
to
the
matter
of
the
question
to
wit
how
a
tradesman
should
in
trading
keep
a
good
conscience
a
buyer
or
seller
either
secondly
how
he
should
prepare
himself
to
this
work
and
live
in
the
practice
of
it
for
the
first
he
must
observe
what
hath
been
said
before
to
wit
he
must
have
conscience
to
god
charity
to
his
neighbour
and
i
will
add
much
moderation
in
dealing
let
him
therefore
keep
within
the
bounds
of
the
affirmative
of
those
eight
reasons
that
before
were
urged
to
prove
that
men
ought
not
in
their
dealing
but
to
do
justly
and
mercifully
twixt
man
and
man
and
then
there
will
be
no
great
fear
of
wronging
the
seller
buyer
or
himself
but
particularly
to
prepare
or
instruct
a
man
to
this
work
let
the
tradesman
or
others
consider
that
there
is
not
that
in
great
gettings
and
in
abundance
which
the
most
of
men
do
suppose
for
all
that
a
man
has
over
and
above
what
serves
for
his
present
necessity
and
supply
serves
only
to
feed
the
lusts
of
the
eye
for
what
good
is
there
to
the
owners
thereof
save
the
beholding
of
them
with
their
eyes
men
also
many
times
in
getting
of
riches
get
therewith
a
snare
to
their
soul
but
few
get
good
by
getting
of
them
but
this
consideration
badman
could
not
abide
consider
that
the
getting
of
wealth
dishonestly
as
he
does
that
getteth
it
without
good
conscience
and
charity
to
his
neighbour
is
a
great
offender
against
god
hence
he
says
i
have
smitten
mine
hands
at
thy
dishonest
gain
which
thou
hast
made
it
is
a
manner
of
speech
that
shews
anger
in
the
very
making
of
mention
of
the
crime
therefore
consider
that
a
little
honestly
gotten
though
it
may
yield
thee
but
a
dinner
of
herbs
at
a
time
will
yield
more
peace
therewith
than
will
a
stalled
ox
ill
gotten
better
is
a
little
with
righteousness
than
great
revenues
without
right
be
thou
confident
that
gods
eyes
are
upon
all
thy
wayes
and
that
he
pondereth
all
thy
goings
and
also
that
he
marks
them
writes
them
down
and
seals
them
up
in
a
bag
against
the
time
to
come
be
thou
sure
that
thou
remembrest
that
thou
knowest
not
the
day
of
thy
death
remember
also
that
when
death
comes
god
will
give
thy
substance
for
the
which
thou
hast
laboured
and
for
the
which
perhaps
thou
hast
hazarded
thy
soul
to
one
thou
knowest
not
who
nor
whether
he
shall
be
a
wise
man
or
a
fool
and
then
what
profit
hath
he
that
laboureth
for
the
wind
besides
thou
shalt
have
nothing
that
thou
mayest
so
much
as
carry
away
in
thine
hand
guilt
shall
goe
with
thee
if
thou
hast
got
it
dishonestly
and
they
also
to
whom
thou
shalt
leave
it
shall
receive
it
to
their
hurt
these
things
duly
considered
and
made
use
of
by
thee
to
the
preparing
of
thy
heart
to
thy
calling
of
buying
or
selling
i
come
in
the
next
place
to
shew
thee
how
thou
shouldest
live
in
the
practick
part
of
this
art
art
thou
to
buy
or
sell
if
thou
sellest
do
not
commend
if
thou
buyest
do
not
dispraise
any
otherwise
but
to
give
the
thing
that
thou
hast
to
do
with
its
just
value
and
worth
for
thou
canst
not
do
otherwise
knowingly
but
of
a
covetous
and
wicked
mind
wherefore
else
are
comodities
by
the
seller
and
also
by
the
buyer
it
is
naught
it
is
naught
says
the
buyer
but
when
he
hath
got
his
bargain
he
boasteth
thereof
what
hath
this
man
done
now
but
lyed
in
the
dispraising
of
his
bargain
and
why
did
he
dispraise
it
but
of
a
covetous
mind
to
wrong
and
beguile
the
seller
art
thou
a
seller
and
do
things
grow
dear
set
not
thy
hand
to
help
or
hold
them
up
higher
this
can
not
be
done
without
wickedness
neither
for
this
is
a
making
of
the
sheckle
great
art
thou
a
buyer
and
do
things
grow
dear
use
no
cunning
or
deceitful
language
to
pull
them
down
for
that
can
not
be
done
but
wickedly
too
what
then
shall
we
do
will
you
say
why
i
answer
leave
things
to
the
providence
of
god
and
do
thou
with
moderation
submit
to
his
hand
but
since
when
they
are
growing
dear
the
hand
that
upholds
the
price
is
for
the
time
more
strong
than
that
which
would
pull
it
down
that
being
the
hand
of
the
seller
who
loveth
to
have
it
dear
specially
if
it
shall
rise
in
his
hand
therefore
i
say
do
thou
take
heed
and
have
not
a
hand
in
it
the
which
thou
mayest
have
to
thine
own
and
thy
neighbours
hurt
these
three
ways
by
crying
out
scarcity
scarcity
beyond
the
truth
and
state
of
things
especially
take
heed
of
doing
of
this
by
way
of
a
prognostick
for
time
to
come
twas
for
this
for
which
he
was
trodden
to
death
in
the
gate
of
samaria
that
you
read
of
in
the
book
of
kings
this
sin
has
a
double
evil
in
it
it
belieth
the
present
blessing
of
god
amongst
us
and
it
undervalueth
the
riches
of
his
goodness
which
can
make
all
good
things
to
abound
towards
us
this
wicked
thing
may
be
done
by
hoarding
up
when
the
hunger
and
necessity
of
the
poor
calls
for
it
now
that
god
may
shew
his
dislike
against
this
he
doth
as
it
were
license
the
people
to
curse
such
an
hoarder
up
he
that
withholdeth
corn
the
people
shall
curse
him
but
blessing
shall
be
upon
the
head
of
him
that
selleth
it
but
if
things
will
rise
do
thou
be
grieved
be
also
moderate
in
all
thy
sellings
and
be
sure
let
the
poor
have
a
pennyworth
and
sell
thy
corn
to
those
in
necessity
which
then
thou
wilt
do
when
thou
shewest
mercy
to
the
poor
in
thy
selling
to
him
and
when
thou
for
his
sake
because
he
is
poor
undersellest
the
market
this
is
to
buy
and
sell
with
good
conscience
thy
buyer
thou
wrongest
not
thy
conscience
thou
wrongest
not
thy
self
thou
wrongest
not
for
god
will
surely
recompense
thee
i
have
spoken
concerning
corn
but
thy
duty
is
to
let
thy
moderation
in
all
things
be
known
unto
all
men
the
lord
is
at
hand
atten
well
sir
now
i
have
heard
enough
of
badmans
naughtiness
pray
now
proceed
to
his
death
wise
why
sir
the
sun
is
not
so
low
we
have
yet
three
hours
to
night
atten
nay
i
am
not
in
any
great
hast
but
i
thought
you
had
even
now
done
with
his
life
wise
done
no
i
have
yet
much
more
to
say
atten
then
he
has
much
more
wickedness
than
i
thought
he
had
wise
that
may
be
but
let
us
proceed
this
badman
added
to
all
his
wickedness
this
he
was
a
very
proud
man
a
very
proud
man
he
was
exceeding
proud
and
haughty
in
mind
he
looked
that
what
he
said
ought
not
must
not
be
contradicted
or
opposed
he
counted
himself
as
wise
as
the
wisest
in
the
countrey
as
good
as
the
best
and
as
beautiful
as
he
that
had
most
of
it
he
took
great
delight
in
praising
of
himself
and
as
much
in
the
praises
that
others
gave
him
he
could
not
abide
that
any
should
think
themselves
above
him
or
that
their
wit
or
personage
should
by
others
be
set
before
his
he
had
scarce
a
fellowly
carriage
for
his
equals
but
for
those
that
were
of
an
inferior
ranck
he
would
look
over
them
in
great
contempt
and
if
at
any
time
he
had
any
remote
occasion
of
having
to
do
with
them
he
would
shew
great
height
and
a
very
domineering
spirit
so
that
in
this
it
may
be
said
that
solomon
gave
a
characteristical
note
of
him
when
he
said
proud
and
haughty
scorner
is
his
name
who
dealeth
in
proud
wrath
he
never
thought
his
dyet
well
enough
dressed
his
cloathes
fine
enough
made
or
his
praise
enough
refined
atten
this
pride
is
a
sin
that
sticks
as
close
to
nature
i
think
as
most
sins
there
is
uncleanness
and
pride
i
know
not
of
any
two
gross
sins
that
stick
closer
to
men
then
they
they
have
as
i
may
call
it
an
interest
in
nature
it
likes
them
because
they
most
suit
its
lusts
and
fancies
and
therefore
no
marvel
though
badman
was
tainted
with
pride
since
he
had
so
wickedly
given
up
himself
to
work
all
iniquity
with
greediness
wise
you
say
right
pride
is
a
sin
that
sticks
close
to
nature
and
is
one
of
the
first
follies
wherein
it
shews
it
self
to
be
polluted
for
even
in
childhood
even
in
little
children
pride
will
first
of
all
shew
it
self
it
is
a
hasty
an
early
appearance
of
the
sin
of
the
soul
it
as
i
may
say
is
that
corruption
that
strives
for
predominancy
in
the
heart
and
therefore
usually
comes
out
first
but
though
children
are
so
incident
to
it
yet
methinks
those
of
more
years
should
be
ashamed
thereof
i
might
at
the
first
have
begun
with
badmans
pride
only
i
think
it
is
not
the
pride
in
infancy
that
begins
to
make
a
difference
betwixt
one
and
another
as
did
and
do
those
wherewith
i
began
my
relation
of
his
life
therefore
i
passed
it
over
but
now
since
he
had
no
more
consideration
of
himself
and
of
his
vile
and
sinful
state
but
to
be
proud
when
come
to
years
i
have
taken
the
occasion
in
this
place
to
make
mention
of
his
pride
atten
but
pray
if
you
can
remember
them
tell
me
of
some
places
of
scripture
that
speak
against
pride
i
the
rather
desire
this
because
that
pride
is
now
a
reigning
sin
and
i
happen
sometimes
to
fall
into
the
company
of
them
that
in
my
conscience
are
proud
very
much
and
i
have
a
mind
also
to
tell
them
of
their
sin
now
when
i
tell
them
of
it
unless
i
bring
gods
word
too
i
doubt
they
will
laugh
me
to
scorn
wise
laugh
you
to
scorn
the
proud
man
will
laugh
you
to
scorn
bring
to
him
what
text
you
can
except
god
shall
smite
him
in
his
conscience
by
the
word
badman
did
use
to
serve
them
so
that
did
use
to
tell
him
of
his
and
besides
when
you
have
said
what
you
can
they
will
tell
you
they
are
not
proud
and
that
you
are
rather
the
proud
man
else
you
would
not
judge
nor
so
malapertly
meddle
with
other
mens
matters
as
you
do
nevertheless
since
you
desire
it
i
will
mention
two
or
three
texts
they
are
these
pride
and
arrogancy
do
i
hate
a
mans
pride
shall
bring
him
low
and
he
shall
bring
down
their
pride
and
all
the
proud
and
all
that
do
wickedly
shall
be
as
stubble
and
the
day
that
comes
shall
burn
them
up
this
last
is
a
dreadful
text
it
is
enough
to
make
a
proud
man
shake
god
saith
he
will
make
the
proud
ones
as
stubble
that
is
as
fuel
for
the
fire
and
the
day
that
cometh
shall
be
like
a
burning
oven
and
that
day
shall
burn
them
up
saith
the
lord
but
badman
could
never
abide
to
hear
pride
spoken
against
nor
that
any
should
say
of
him
he
is
a
proud
man
atten
what
should
be
the
reason
of
that
wise
he
did
not
tell
me
the
reason
but
i
suppose
it
to
be
that
which
is
common
to
all
vile
persons
they
love
this
vice
but
care
not
to
bear
its
name
the
drunkard
loves
the
sin
but
loves
not
to
be
called
a
drunkard
the
thief
loveth
to
steal
but
can
not
abide
to
be
called
a
thief
the
whore
loveth
to
commit
uncleanness
but
loveth
not
to
be
called
a
whore
and
so
badman
loved
to
be
proud
but
could
not
abide
to
be
called
a
proud
man
the
sweet
of
sin
is
desirable
to
polluted
and
corrupted
man
but
the
name
thereof
is
a
blot
in
his
scutcheon
atten
tis
true
that
you
have
said
but
pray
how
many
sorts
of
pride
are
there
wise
there
are
two
sorts
of
pride
pride
of
spirit
and
pride
of
body
the
first
of
these
is
thus
made
mention
of
in
the
scriptures
every
one
that
is
proud
in
heart
is
abomination
to
the
lord
a
high
look
and
a
proud
heart
and
the
plowing
of
the
wicked
is
sin
the
patient
in
spirit
is
better
than
the
proud
in
spirit
bodily
pride
these
scriptures
mention
in
that
day
the
lord
shall
take
away
the
bravery
of
their
tinckling
ornaments
about
their
feet
and
their
cauls
and
their
round
tires
like
the
moon
the
chains
and
the
bracelets
and
the
mufflers
the
bonnets
and
the
ornaments
of
the
legs
and
the
headbands
and
the
tablets
and
the
the
rings
and
the
the
changable
suits
of
apparell
and
the
mantles
and
the
wimples
and
the
crisping
pins
the
glasses
and
the
fine
linnen
and
the
hoods
and
the
vails
by
these
expressions
it
is
evident
that
there
is
pride
of
body
as
well
as
pride
of
spirit
and
that
both
are
sin
and
so
abominable
to
the
lord
but
these
texts
badman
could
never
abide
to
read
they
were
to
him
as
micaiah
was
to
ahab
they
never
spake
good
of
him
but
evil
atten
i
suppose
that
it
was
not
badmans
case
alone
even
to
maligne
those
texts
that
speak
against
their
vices
for
i
believe
that
most
ungodly
men
where
the
scriptures
are
have
a
secret
antipathy
against
those
words
of
god
that
do
most
plainly
and
fully
rebuke
them
for
their
sins
wise
that
is
out
of
doubt
and
by
that
antipathy
they
shew
that
sin
and
satan
are
more
welcome
to
them
than
are
the
wholesome
instructions
of
life
and
godliness
atten
well
but
not
to
goe
off
from
our
discourse
of
badman
you
say
he
was
proud
but
will
you
shew
me
now
some
symptoms
of
one
that
is
proud
wise
yes
that
i
will
and
first
i
will
shew
you
some
symptoms
of
pride
of
heart
pride
of
heart
is
seen
by
outward
things
as
pride
of
body
in
general
is
a
sign
of
pride
of
heart
for
all
proud
gestures
of
the
body
flow
from
pride
of
heart
therefore
solomon
saith
there
is
a
generation
o
how
lofty
are
their
eyes
and
their
are
lifted
up
and
again
there
is
that
exalteth
their
gate
their
going
now
these
lofty
eyes
and
this
exalting
of
the
gate
is
a
sign
of
a
proud
heart
for
both
these
actions
come
from
the
heart
for
out
of
the
heart
comes
pride
in
all
the
visible
appearances
of
it
but
more
particularly
heart
pride
is
discovered
by
a
stretched
out
neck
and
by
mincing
as
they
go
for
the
wicked
the
proud
have
a
proud
neck
a
proud
foot
a
proud
tongue
by
which
this
their
going
is
exalted
this
is
that
which
makes
them
look
scornfully
speak
ruggedly
and
carry
it
huffingly
among
their
neighbours
a
proud
heart
is
a
persecuting
one
the
wicked
through
his
pride
doth
persecute
the
poor
a
prayerless
man
is
a
proud
man
a
contentious
man
is
a
proud
man
the
disdainful
man
is
a
proud
man
the
man
that
oppresses
his
neighbour
is
a
proud
man
he
that
hearkeneth
not
to
gods
word
with
reverence
and
fear
is
a
proud
man
and
he
that
calls
the
proud
happy
is
be
sure
a
proud
man
all
these
are
proud
in
heart
and
this
their
pride
of
heart
doth
thus
discover
it
self
as
to
bodily
pride
it
is
discovered
that
is
something
of
it
by
all
the
particulars
mentioned
before
for
though
they
are
said
to
be
symptoms
of
pride
of
heart
yet
they
are
symptoms
of
that
pride
by
their
shewing
of
themselves
in
the
body
you
know
diseases
that
are
within
are
seen
by
outward
and
visible
signs
yet
by
them
very
signs
even
the
outside
is
defiled
also
so
all
those
visible
signs
of
are
signs
of
bodily
pride
also
but
to
come
to
more
outward
signs
the
putting
on
of
gold
and
pearls
and
costly
array
the
pleating
of
the
hair
the
following
of
fashions
the
seeking
by
gestures
to
imitate
the
proud
either
by
speech
looks
dresses
goings
or
other
fools
baubles
of
which
at
this
time
the
world
is
full
all
these
and
many
more
are
signs
as
of
a
proud
heart
so
of
bodily
pride
also
but
badman
would
not
allow
by
any
means
that
this
should
be
called
pride
but
rather
neatness
handsomness
comeliness
cleanliness
neither
would
he
allow
that
following
of
fashions
was
any
thing
else
but
because
he
would
not
be
proud
singular
and
esteemed
fantastical
by
his
neighbours
atten
but
i
have
been
told
that
when
some
have
been
rebuked
for
their
pride
they
have
turned
it
again
upon
the
brotherhood
of
those
by
whom
they
have
been
rebuked
saying
physician
heal
thy
friends
look
at
home
among
your
brotherhood
even
among
the
wisest
of
you
and
see
if
you
your
selves
be
clear
even
you
professors
for
who
is
prouder
than
you
professors
scarcesly
the
devil
himself
wise
my
heart
akes
at
this
answer
because
there
is
too
much
cause
for
it
this
very
answer
would
badman
give
his
wife
when
she
as
she
would
sometimes
reproved
him
for
his
pride
we
shall
have
says
he
great
amendments
in
living
now
for
the
devil
is
turned
a
corrector
of
vice
for
no
sin
reigneth
more
in
the
world
quoth
he
than
pride
among
professors
and
who
can
contradict
him
let
us
give
the
devil
his
due
the
thing
is
too
apparent
for
any
man
to
deny
and
i
doubt
not
but
the
same
answer
is
ready
in
the
mouths
of
badmans
friends
for
they
may
and
do
see
pride
display
it
self
in
the
apparel
and
carriages
of
professors
one
may
say
almost
as
much
as
among
any
people
in
the
land
the
more
is
the
pity
ay
and
i
fear
that
even
their
extravagancies
in
this
hath
hardened
the
heart
of
many
a
one
as
i
perceive
it
did
somewhat
the
heart
of
badman
himself
for
mine
own
part
i
have
seen
many
my
self
and
those
too
so
deckt
and
bedaubed
with
their
fangles
and
toyes
and
that
when
they
have
been
at
the
solemn
appointments
of
god
in
the
way
of
his
worship
that
i
have
wondred
with
what
face
such
painted
persons
could
sit
in
the
place
where
they
were
without
swounding
but
certainly
the
holiness
of
god
and
also
the
pollution
of
themselves
by
sin
must
needs
be
very
far
out
of
the
minds
of
such
people
what
profession
soever
they
make
i
have
read
of
an
whores
forehead
and
i
have
read
of
i
have
read
of
costly
array
and
of
that
which
becometh
women
professing
godliness
with
good
works
but
if
i
might
speak
i
know
what
i
know
and
could
say
and
yet
do
no
wrong
that
which
would
make
some
professors
stink
in
their
places
but
now
i
forbear
atten
sir
you
seem
to
be
greatly
concerned
at
this
but
what
i
shall
say
more
it
is
whispered
that
some
good
ministers
have
countenanced
their
people
in
their
light
and
wanton
apparrel
yea
have
pleaded
for
their
gold
and
pearls
and
costly
array
wise
i
know
not
what
they
have
pleaded
for
but
tis
easily
seen
that
they
tolerate
or
at
least
wise
wink
and
connive
at
such
things
both
in
their
wives
and
children
and
so
from
the
prophets
of
jerusalem
is
profaneness
gone
forth
into
all
the
land
and
when
the
hand
of
the
rulers
are
chief
in
a
trespass
who
can
keep
their
people
from
being
drowned
in
that
trespass
atten
this
is
a
lamentation
and
must
stand
for
a
lamentation
wise
so
it
is
and
so
it
must
and
i
will
add
it
is
a
shame
it
is
a
reproach
it
is
a
to
the
blind
for
though
men
be
as
blind
as
badman
himself
yet
they
can
see
the
foolish
lightness
that
must
needs
be
the
bottom
of
all
these
apish
and
wanton
extravagancies
but
many
have
their
excuses
ready
to
wit
their
parents
their
husbands
and
their
breeding
calls
for
it
and
the
like
yea
the
examples
of
good
people
prompt
them
to
it
but
all
these
will
be
but
the
spiders
webb
when
the
thunder
of
the
word
of
the
great
god
shall
rattle
from
heaven
against
them
as
it
will
at
death
or
judgment
but
i
wish
it
might
do
it
before
but
alas
these
excuses
are
but
bare
pretences
these
proud
ones
love
to
have
it
so
i
once
talked
with
a
maid
by
way
of
reproof
for
her
fond
and
gaudy
garment
but
she
told
me
picture
take
note
symbol
the
tailor
would
make
it
so
when
alas
poor
proud
girle
she
gave
order
to
the
taylor
so
to
make
it
many
make
parents
and
husbands
and
taylors
the
blind
to
others
but
their
naughty
hearts
and
their
giving
of
way
thereto
that
is
the
original
cause
of
all
these
evils
atten
now
you
are
speaking
of
the
cause
of
pride
pray
shew
me
yet
further
why
pride
is
now
so
much
in
request
wise
i
will
shew
you
what
i
think
are
the
reasons
of
it
the
first
is
because
such
persons
are
led
by
their
own
hearts
rather
than
by
the
word
of
god
i
told
you
before
that
the
original
fountain
of
pride
is
the
heart
for
out
of
the
heart
comes
pride
it
is
therefore
because
they
are
led
by
their
hearts
which
naturally
tends
to
lift
them
up
in
pride
this
pride
of
heart
tempts
them
and
by
its
deceits
overcometh
them
yea
it
doth
put
a
bewitching
vertue
into
their
peacocks
feathers
and
then
they
are
swallowed
up
with
the
vanity
of
them
another
reason
why
professors
are
so
proud
for
those
we
are
talking
of
now
is
because
they
are
more
apt
to
take
example
of
those
that
are
of
the
world
than
they
are
to
take
example
of
those
that
are
saints
indeed
pride
is
of
the
world
for
all
that
is
of
the
world
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
the
lust
of
the
eyes
and
the
pride
of
life
are
not
of
the
father
but
of
the
world
of
the
world
therefore
professors
learn
to
be
proud
but
they
should
not
take
them
for
example
it
will
be
objected
no
nor
your
saints
neither
for
you
are
as
proud
as
others
well
let
them
take
shame
that
are
guilty
but
when
i
say
professors
should
take
example
for
their
life
by
those
that
are
saints
indeed
i
mean
as
peter
says
they
should
take
example
of
those
that
were
in
old
time
the
saints
for
saints
of
old
time
were
the
best
therefore
to
these
he
directeth
us
for
our
pattern
let
the
wives
conversation
be
chast
and
also
coupled
with
fear
whose
adorning
saith
peter
let
it
not
be
that
outward
adorning
of
pleating
the
hair
and
of
wearing
of
gold
or
of
putting
on
of
apparel
but
let
it
be
the
hidden
man
of
the
heart
in
that
which
is
not
corruptible
even
the
ornament
of
a
meek
and
quiet
spirit
which
is
in
the
sight
of
god
of
great
price
for
after
this
manner
in
the
old
time
the
holy
women
also
who
trusted
in
god
adorned
themselves
being
in
subjection
to
their
own
husbands
another
reason
is
because
they
have
forgotten
the
pollution
of
their
nature
for
the
remembrance
of
that
must
needs
keep
us
humble
and
being
kept
humble
we
shall
be
at
a
distance
from
pride
the
proud
and
the
humble
are
set
in
opposition
god
resisteth
the
proud
but
giveth
grace
to
the
humble
and
can
it
be
imagined
that
a
sensible
christian
should
be
a
proud
one
sence
of
baseness
tends
to
lay
us
low
not
to
lift
us
up
with
pride
not
with
pride
of
heart
nor
pride
of
life
but
when
a
man
begins
to
forget
what
he
is
then
he
if
ever
begins
to
be
proud
methinks
it
is
one
of
the
most
senceless
and
ridiculous
things
in
the
world
that
a
man
should
be
proud
of
that
which
is
given
him
on
purpose
to
cover
the
shame
of
his
nakedness
with
persons
that
are
proud
have
gotten
god
and
his
holiness
out
of
their
sight
if
god
was
before
them
as
he
is
behind
their
back
and
if
they
saw
him
in
his
holiness
as
he
sees
them
in
their
sins
and
shame
they
would
take
but
little
pleasure
in
their
apish
knacks
the
holiness
of
god
makes
the
angels
cover
their
faces
crumbles
christians
when
they
behold
it
into
dust
and
ashes
and
as
his
majesty
is
such
is
his
word
therefore
they
abuse
it
that
bring
it
to
countenance
pride
lastly
but
what
can
be
the
end
of
those
that
are
proud
in
the
decking
of
themselves
after
their
antick
manner
why
are
they
for
going
with
their
with
their
naked
shoulders
and
paps
hanging
out
like
a
cows
bag
why
are
they
for
painting
their
faces
for
stretching
out
their
necks
and
for
putting
of
themselves
into
all
the
formalities
which
proud
fancy
leads
them
to
is
it
because
they
would
honour
god
because
they
would
adorn
the
gospel
because
they
would
beautifie
religion
and
make
sinners
to
fall
in
love
with
their
own
salvation
no
no
it
is
rather
to
please
their
lusts
to
satisfie
their
wild
and
extravagant
fancies
and
i
wish
none
doth
it
to
stir
up
lust
in
others
to
the
end
they
may
commit
uncleanness
with
them
i
believe
whatever
is
their
end
this
is
one
of
the
great
designes
of
the
devil
and
i
believe
also
that
satan
has
drawn
more
into
the
sin
of
uncleanness
by
the
spangling
shew
of
fine
cloaths
than
he
could
possibly
have
drawn
unto
it
without
them
i
wonder
what
it
was
that
of
old
was
called
the
attire
of
an
harlot
certainly
it
could
not
be
more
bewitching
and
tempting
than
are
the
garments
of
many
professors
this
day
atten
i
like
what
you
say
very
well
and
i
wish
that
all
the
proud
dames
in
england
that
profess
were
within
the
reach
and
sound
of
your
words
wise
what
i
have
said
i
believe
is
true
but
as
for
the
proud
dames
in
england
that
profess
they
have
moses
and
the
prophets
and
if
they
will
not
hear
them
how
then
can
we
hope
that
they
should
recieve
good
by
such
a
dull
sounding
ramshorn
as
i
am
however
i
have
said
my
mind
and
now
if
you
will
we
will
proceed
to
some
other
of
badmans
doings
atten
no
pray
before
you
shew
me
any
thing
else
of
badman
shew
me
yet
more
particularly
the
evil
effects
of
this
sin
of
pride
wise
with
all
my
heart
i
will
answer
your
request
then
tis
pride
that
makes
poor
man
so
like
the
devil
in
hell
that
he
can
not
in
it
be
known
to
be
the
image
and
similitude
of
god
the
angels
when
they
became
devils
twas
through
their
being
lifted
or
puffed
up
with
pride
tis
pride
also
that
lifteth
or
puffeth
up
the
heart
of
the
sinner
and
so
makes
him
to
bear
the
very
image
of
the
devil
pride
makes
a
man
so
odious
in
the
sight
of
god
that
he
shall
not
must
not
come
nigh
his
majesty
though
the
lord
be
high
yet
hath
he
respect
to
the
lowly
but
the
proud
he
knows
afar
off
pride
sets
god
and
the
soul
at
a
distrance
pride
will
not
let
a
man
come
nigh
god
nor
god
will
not
let
a
proud
man
come
nigh
unto
him
now
this
is
a
dreadful
thing
as
pride
sets
so
it
keeps
god
and
the
soul
at
a
distance
god
resisteth
the
proud
resists
that
is
he
opposes
him
he
thrusts
him
from
him
he
contemneth
his
person
and
all
his
performances
come
in
to
gods
ordinances
the
proud
man
may
but
come
into
his
presence
have
communion
with
him
or
blessing
from
him
he
shall
not
for
the
high
god
doth
resist
him
the
word
saith
that
the
lord
will
destroy
the
house
of
the
proud
he
will
destroy
his
house
it
may
be
understood
he
will
destroy
him
and
his
so
he
destroyed
proud
pharaoh
so
he
destroyed
proud
corah
and
many
others
pride
where
it
comes
and
is
entertained
is
a
certain
forerunner
of
some
judgment
that
is
not
far
behind
when
pride
goes
before
shame
and
destruction
will
follow
after
when
pride
cometh
then
cometh
shame
pride
goeth
before
destruction
and
a
haughty
spirit
before
a
fall
persisting
in
pride
makes
the
condition
of
a
poor
man
as
remediless
as
is
that
of
the
devils
themselves
and
this
i
fear
was
badmans
condition
and
that
was
the
reason
that
he
died
so
as
he
did
as
i
shall
shew
you
anon
but
what
need
i
thus
talk
of
the
particular
actions
or
rather
prodigious
sins
of
badman
when
his
whole
life
and
all
his
actions
went
as
it
were
to
the
making
up
one
massie
body
of
sin
instead
of
believing
that
there
was
a
god
his
mouth
his
life
and
actions
declared
that
he
believed
no
such
thing
his
transgression
said
within
my
heart
that
there
was
no
fear
of
god
before
his
eyes
instead
of
honouring
of
god
and
of
giving
glory
to
him
for
any
of
his
mercies
or
under
any
of
his
good
providences
towards
him
for
god
is
good
to
all
and
lets
his
sun
shine
and
his
rain
fall
upon
the
unthankful
and
unholy
he
would
ascribe
the
glory
to
other
causes
if
they
were
mercies
he
would
ascribe
them
if
the
open
face
of
the
providence
did
not
give
him
the
lye
to
his
own
wit
labour
care
industry
cunning
or
the
like
if
they
were
crosses
he
would
ascribe
them
or
count
them
the
offspring
of
fortune
ill
luck
chance
the
ill
mannagement
of
matters
the
ill
will
of
neighbours
or
to
his
wifes
being
religious
and
spending
as
he
called
it
too
much
time
in
reading
praying
or
the
like
it
was
not
in
his
way
to
acknowledge
god
that
is
graciously
or
his
hand
in
things
but
as
the
prophet
saith
let
favour
be
skewed
to
the
wicked
yet
will
he
not
learn
righteousness
and
again
they
returned
not
to
him
that
smote
them
nor
did
they
seek
the
lord
of
hosts
this
was
badmans
temper
neither
mercies
nor
judgment
would
make
him
seek
the
lord
nay
as
another
scripture
sayes
he
would
not
see
the
works
of
god
nor
regard
the
operations
of
his
hands
either
in
mercies
or
in
judgments
but
further
when
by
providence
he
has
been
cast
under
the
best
means
for
his
soul
for
as
was
shewed
before
he
having
had
a
good
master
and
before
him
a
good
father
and
after
all
a
good
wife
and
being
sometimes
upon
a
journey
and
cast
under
the
hearing
of
a
good
sermon
as
he
would
sometimes
for
novelties
sake
go
to
hear
a
good
preacher
he
was
always
without
heart
to
make
use
thereof
in
this
land
of
righteousness
he
would
deal
unjustly
and
would
not
behold
the
majesty
of
the
lord
instead
of
reverencing
the
word
when
he
heard
it
preached
read
or
discoursed
of
he
would
sleep
talk
of
other
business
or
else
object
against
the
authority
harmony
and
wisdom
of
the
scriptures
saying
how
do
you
know
them
to
be
the
word
of
god
how
do
you
know
that
these
sayings
are
true
the
scriptures
he
would
say
were
as
a
nose
of
wax
and
a
man
may
turn
them
whithersoever
he
lists
one
scripture
says
one
thing
and
another
sayes
the
quite
contrary
besides
they
make
mention
of
a
thousand
imposibilities
they
are
the
cause
of
all
dissensions
and
discords
that
are
in
the
land
therefore
you
may
would
he
say
still
think
what
you
will
but
in
my
mind
they
are
best
at
ease
that
have
least
to
do
with
them
instead
of
loving
and
honouring
of
them
that
did
bear
in
their
foreheads
the
name
and
in
their
lives
the
image
of
christ
they
should
be
his
song
the
matter
of
his
jests
and
the
objects
of
his
slanders
he
would
either
make
a
mock
at
their
sober
deportment
their
gracious
language
quiet
behaviour
or
else
desperately
swear
that
they
did
all
in
deceit
and
hypocrisie
he
would
endeavour
to
render
godly
men
as
odious
and
contemptable
as
he
could
any
lyes
that
were
made
by
any
to
their
disgrace
those
he
would
avouch
for
truth
and
would
not
endure
to
be
controlled
he
was
much
like
those
that
the
prophet
speaks
of
that
would
sit
and
slander
his
mothers
son
yea
he
would
speak
reproachfully
of
his
wife
though
his
conscience
told
him
and
many
would
testifie
that
she
was
a
very
vertuous
woman
he
would
also
raise
slanders
of
his
wives
friends
himself
affirming
that
their
doctrine
tended
to
lasciviousness
and
that
in
their
assemblies
they
acted
and
did
unbeseeming
men
and
women
that
they
committed
uncleanness
he
was
much
like
those
that
affirmed
the
apostle
should
say
let
us
do
evil
that
good
may
come
or
like
those
of
whom
it
is
thus
written
report
say
they
and
we
will
report
it
and
if
he
could
get
any
thing
by
the
end
that
had
scandal
in
it
if
it
did
but
touch
professors
how
falsely
soever
reported
oh
then
he
would
glory
laugh
and
be
glad
and
lay
it
upon
the
whole
party
saying
hang
them
rogues
there
is
not
a
barrel
better
herring
of
all
the
holy
brotherhood
of
them
like
to
like
quoth
the
devil
to
the
collier
this
is
your
precise
crew
and
then
he
would
send
all
home
with
a
curse
atten
if
those
that
make
profession
of
religion
be
wise
badmans
watchings
and
words
will
make
them
the
more
wary
and
careful
in
all
things
wise
you
say
true
for
when
we
see
men
do
watch
for
our
halting
and
rejoyce
to
see
us
stumble
and
fall
it
should
make
us
so
much
abundance
the
more
careful
i
do
think
it
was
as
delightful
to
badman
to
hear
raise
and
tell
lies
and
lying
stories
of
them
that
fear
the
lord
as
it
was
for
him
to
go
to
bed
when
a
weary
but
we
will
at
this
time
let
these
things
pass
for
as
he
was
in
these
things
bad
enough
so
he
added
to
these
many
more
the
like
he
was
an
angry
wrathfull
envious
man
a
man
that
knew
not
what
meekness
or
gentleness
meant
nor
did
he
desire
to
learn
his
natural
temper
was
to
be
surly
huffie
and
rugged
and
worse
and
he
so
gave
way
to
his
temper
as
to
this
that
it
brought
him
to
be
furious
and
outrageous
in
all
things
specially
against
goodness
it
self
and
against
other
things
too
when
he
was
displeased
atten
solomon
saith
he
is
a
fool
that
rageth
wise
he
doth
so
and
sayes
moreover
that
anger
rests
in
the
bosom
of
fools
and
truly
if
it
be
a
sign
of
a
fool
to
have
anger
rest
in
his
bosom
then
was
badman
notwithstanding
the
conceit
that
he
had
of
his
own
abilities
a
fool
of
no
small
size
atten
fools
are
mostly
most
wise
in
their
own
eyes
wise
true
but
i
was
a
saying
that
if
it
be
a
sign
that
a
man
is
a
fool
when
anger
rests
in
his
bosom
then
what
is
it
a
sign
of
think
you
when
malice
and
envy
rests
there
for
to
my
knowledge
badman
was
as
malicious
and
as
envious
a
man
as
commonly
you
can
hear
of
atten
certainly
malice
and
envy
flow
from
pride
and
arrogancy
and
they
again
from
ignorance
and
ignorance
from
the
devil
and
i
thought
that
since
you
spake
of
the
pride
of
badman
before
we
should
have
something
of
these
before
we
had
done
wise
envy
flows
from
ignorance
indeed
and
this
badman
was
so
envious
an
one
where
he
set
against
that
he
would
swell
with
it
as
a
toad
as
we
say
swells
with
poyson
he
whom
he
maligned
might
at
any
time
even
read
envy
in
his
face
wherever
he
met
with
him
or
in
whatever
he
had
to
do
with
him
his
envy
was
so
rank
and
strong
that
if
it
at
any
time
turned
its
head
against
a
man
it
would
hardly
ever
be
pulled
in
again
he
would
watch
over
that
man
to
do
him
mischief
as
the
cat
watches
over
the
mouse
to
destroy
it
yea
he
would
wait
seven
years
but
he
would
have
an
opportunity
to
hurt
him
and
when
he
had
it
he
would
make
him
feel
the
weight
of
his
envy
envy
is
a
devilish
thing
the
scripture
intimates
that
none
can
stand
before
it
a
stone
is
heavy
and
the
sand
weighty
but
a
fools
wrath
is
heavier
than
them
both
wrath
is
cruel
and
anger
is
outrageous
but
who
can
stand
before
envy
this
envy
for
the
foulness
of
it
is
reckoned
among
the
foulest
villanies
that
are
as
adultery
murder
drunkenness
revellings
witchcrafts
heresies
seditions
yea
it
is
so
malignant
a
corruption
that
it
rots
the
very
bones
of
him
in
whom
it
dwells
a
sound
heart
is
life
to
the
flesh
but
envy
the
rottenness
of
the
bones
atten
this
envy
is
the
very
father
and
mother
of
a
great
many
hideous
and
prodigious
wickednesses
i
say
it
is
the
very
father
and
mother
of
them
it
both
besets
them
and
also
nourishes
them
up
till
they
come
to
their
cursed
maturity
in
the
bosom
of
him
that
entertains
them
wise
you
have
given
it
a
very
right
description
in
calling
of
it
the
father
and
mother
of
a
great
many
other
prodigious
wickednesses
for
it
is
so
venomous
and
vile
a
thing
that
it
puts
the
whole
course
of
nature
out
of
order
and
makes
it
fit
for
nothing
but
confusion
and
a
hold
for
every
evil
thing
for
where
envy
and
strife
is
there
is
confusion
and
every
evil
work
wherefore
i
say
you
have
rightly
called
it
the
very
father
and
mother
of
a
great
many
other
sins
and
now
for
our
further
edification
i
will
reckon
up
some
of
the
births
of
envy
envy
as
i
told
you
before
it
rotteth
the
very
bones
of
him
that
entertains
it
and
as
you
have
also
hinted
it
is
heavier
than
a
stone
than
sand
yea
and
i
will
add
it
falls
like
a
upon
the
head
therefore
it
kills
him
that
throws
it
and
him
at
whom
it
is
thrown
envy
slayeth
the
silly
one
that
is
him
in
whom
it
resides
and
him
who
is
its
object
twas
that
also
that
slew
jesus
christ
himself
for
his
adversaries
persecuted
him
through
their
envy
envy
was
that
by
vertue
of
which
joseph
was
sold
by
his
brethren
into
egypt
tis
envy
that
hath
the
hand
in
making
of
variance
among
gods
saints
tis
envy
in
the
hearts
of
sinners
that
stirres
them
up
to
thrust
gods
ministers
out
of
their
coasts
what
shall
i
say
tis
envy
that
is
the
very
nursery
of
whisperings
debates
backbitings
slanders
reproaches
murders
tis
not
possible
to
repeat
all
the
particular
fruits
of
this
sinfull
root
therefore
it
is
no
marvel
that
badman
was
such
an
ill
natured
man
for
the
great
roots
of
all
manner
of
wickedness
were
in
him
unmortified
unmaimed
untouched
atten
but
it
is
a
rare
case
even
this
of
badman
that
he
should
never
in
all
his
life
be
touched
with
remorse
for
his
life
wise
remorse
i
can
not
say
he
ever
had
if
by
remorse
you
mean
repentance
for
his
evils
yet
twice
i
remember
he
was
under
some
trouble
of
mind
about
his
condition
once
when
he
broke
his
legg
as
he
came
home
drunk
from
the
and
another
time
when
he
fell
sick
and
thought
he
should
die
besides
these
two
times
i
do
not
remember
any
more
atten
did
he
break
his
legg
then
wise
yes
once
as
he
came
home
drunk
from
the
atten
pray
how
did
he
break
it
wise
why
upon
a
time
he
was
at
an
that
wicked
house
about
two
or
three
miles
from
home
and
having
there
drank
hard
the
greatest
part
of
the
day
when
night
was
come
he
would
stay
no
longer
but
calls
for
his
horse
gets
up
and
like
a
madman
as
drunken
persons
usually
ride
away
he
goes
as
hard
as
horse
could
lay
legs
to
the
ground
thus
he
rid
till
coming
to
a
dirty
place
where
his
horse
flouncing
in
fell
threw
his
master
and
with
his
fall
broke
his
legg
so
there
he
lay
but
you
would
not
think
how
he
swore
at
first
but
after
a
while
he
comeing
to
himself
and
feeling
by
his
pain
and
the
uselesness
of
his
legg
what
case
he
was
in
and
also
fearing
that
this
bout
might
be
his
death
he
began
to
crie
out
after
the
manner
of
such
lord
help
me
lord
have
mercy
upon
me
good
god
deliver
me
and
the
like
so
there
he
lay
till
some
came
by
who
took
him
up
carried
him
home
where
he
lay
for
some
time
before
he
could
go
abroad
again
atten
and
then
you
say
he
called
upon
god
wise
he
cryed
out
in
his
pain
and
would
say
o
god
and
o
lord
help
me
but
whether
it
was
that
his
sin
might
be
pardoned
and
his
soul
saved
or
whether
to
be
rid
of
his
pain
i
will
not
positively
determine
though
i
fear
it
was
but
for
the
last
because
when
his
pain
was
gone
and
he
had
got
hopes
of
mending
even
before
he
could
go
abroad
he
cast
off
prayer
and
began
his
old
game
to
wit
to
be
as
bad
as
he
was
before
he
then
would
send
for
his
old
companions
his
sluts
also
would
come
to
his
house
to
see
him
and
with
them
he
would
be
as
well
as
he
could
for
his
lame
leg
as
vicious
as
they
could
be
for
their
hearts
atten
twas
a
wonder
he
did
not
break
his
neck
wise
his
neck
had
gone
instead
of
his
leg
but
that
god
was
towards
him
he
had
deserved
it
ten
thousand
times
over
there
have
been
many
as
i
have
heard
and
as
i
have
hinted
to
you
before
that
have
taken
their
horses
when
drunk
as
he
but
they
have
gone
from
the
pot
to
the
grave
for
they
have
broken
their
necks
twixt
the
and
home
picture
take
note
symbol
one
hard
by
us
also
drunk
himself
dead
he
drank
and
dyed
in
his
drink
atten
tis
a
sad
thing
to
dye
drunk
wise
so
it
is
but
yet
i
wonder
that
no
more
do
so
for
considering
the
heinousness
of
that
sin
and
with
how
many
other
sins
it
is
accompanied
as
with
oaths
blasphemies
lyes
revellings
whoreings
brawlings
it
is
a
wonder
to
me
that
any
that
live
in
that
sin
should
escape
such
a
blow
from
heaven
that
should
tumble
them
into
their
graves
besides
when
i
consider
also
how
when
they
are
as
drunk
as
beasts
they
without
all
fear
of
danger
will
ride
like
bedlams
and
mad
men
even
as
if
they
did
dare
god
to
meddle
with
them
if
he
durst
for
their
being
drunk
i
say
i
wonder
that
he
doth
not
withdraw
his
protecting
providences
from
them
and
leave
them
to
those
dangers
and
destructions
that
by
their
sin
they
have
deserved
and
that
by
their
bedlam
madness
they
would
rush
themselves
into
only
i
consider
again
that
he
has
appointed
a
day
wherein
he
will
reckon
with
them
and
doth
also
commonly
make
examples
of
some
to
shew
that
he
takes
notice
of
their
sin
abhorrs
their
way
and
will
count
with
them
for
it
at
the
set
time
atten
it
is
worthy
of
our
remark
to
take
notice
how
god
to
shew
his
dislike
of
the
sins
of
men
strikes
some
of
them
down
with
a
blow
as
the
breaking
of
badmans
legg
for
doubtless
that
was
a
stroak
from
heaven
wise
it
is
worth
our
remark
indeed
it
was
an
open
stroak
it
fell
upon
him
while
he
was
in
the
height
of
his
sin
and
it
looks
much
like
to
that
in
job
therefore
he
knoweth
their
works
and
overturneth
them
in
the
night
so
that
they
are
destroyed
he
striketh
them
as
wicked
men
in
the
open
sight
of
others
or
as
the
margent
reads
it
in
the
place
of
beholders
he
layes
them
with
his
stroak
in
the
place
of
beholders
there
was
badman
laid
his
stroak
was
taken
notice
of
by
every
one
his
broken
legg
was
at
this
time
the
badman
has
broken
his
legg
sayes
one
how
did
he
break
it
sayes
another
as
he
came
home
drunk
from
such
an
said
a
third
a
judgment
of
god
upon
him
said
a
fourth
this
his
sin
his
shame
and
punishment
are
all
made
conspicuous
to
all
that
are
about
him
i
will
here
tell
you
another
story
or
two
i
have
read
in
clark
s
for
sinners
that
upon
a
time
a
certain
drunken
fellow
boasted
in
his
cups
that
there
was
neither
heaven
nor
hell
also
he
said
he
believed
that
man
had
no
soul
and
that
for
his
own
part
he
would
sell
his
soul
to
any
that
would
buy
it
then
did
one
of
his
companions
buy
it
of
him
for
a
cup
of
wine
and
presently
the
devil
in
mans
shape
bought
it
of
that
man
again
at
the
same
price
and
so
in
the
presence
of
them
all
laid
hold
on
this
and
carried
him
away
through
the
air
so
that
he
was
never
more
heard
of
in
pag
he
tells
us
also
that
there
was
one
at
salisbury
in
the
midst
of
his
health
drinking
and
carousing
in
a
tavern
and
he
drank
a
health
to
the
devil
saying
that
if
the
devil
would
not
come
and
pledge
him
he
would
not
believe
that
there
was
either
god
or
devil
whereupon
his
companions
stricken
with
fear
hastened
out
of
the
room
and
presently
after
hearing
a
hideous
noise
and
smelling
a
stinking
savour
the
vintner
ran
up
into
the
chamber
and
coming
in
he
missed
his
guest
and
found
the
window
broken
the
iron
barr
in
it
bowed
and
all
bloody
but
the
man
was
never
heard
of
afterwards
again
in
pag
he
tells
us
of
a
bailiff
of
hedly
who
upon
a
lords
day
being
drunk
at
melford
got
upon
his
horse
to
ride
through
the
streets
saying
that
his
horse
would
carry
him
to
the
devil
and
presently
his
horse
threw
him
and
broke
his
neck
these
things
are
worse
than
the
breaking
of
badmans
leg
and
should
be
a
caution
to
all
of
his
friends
that
are
living
lest
they
also
fall
by
their
sin
into
these
sad
judgements
of
god
but
as
i
said
badman
quickly
forgot
all
his
conscience
was
choaked
before
his
legg
was
healed
and
therefore
before
he
was
well
of
the
fruit
of
one
sin
he
tempts
god
to
send
another
judgment
to
seize
upon
him
and
so
he
did
quickly
after
for
not
many
months
after
his
legg
was
well
he
had
a
very
dangerous
fit
of
sickness
insomuch
that
now
he
began
to
think
he
must
dye
in
very
deed
atten
well
and
what
did
he
think
and
do
then
wise
he
thought
he
must
go
to
hell
this
i
know
for
he
could
not
forbear
but
say
so
to
my
best
remembrance
he
lay
crying
out
all
one
night
for
fear
and
at
times
he
would
so
tremble
that
he
would
make
the
very
bed
shake
under
him
but
oh
how
the
thoughts
of
death
of
and
of
eternal
judgment
did
then
wrack
his
conscience
fear
might
be
seen
in
his
face
and
in
his
tossings
to
and
fro
it
might
also
be
heard
in
his
words
and
be
understood
by
his
heavy
groans
he
would
often
cry
i
am
undone
i
am
undone
my
vile
life
has
undone
me
atten
then
his
former
atheistical
thoughts
and
principles
were
too
weak
now
to
support
him
from
the
fears
of
eternal
damnation
wise
aie
they
were
too
weak
indeed
they
may
serve
to
stifle
conscience
when
a
man
is
in
the
midst
of
his
prosperity
and
to
harden
the
heart
against
all
good
counsel
when
a
man
is
left
of
god
and
given
up
to
his
reprobate
mind
but
alas
atheistical
thoughts
notions
and
opinions
must
shrink
and
melt
away
when
god
sends
yea
comes
with
sickness
to
visit
the
soul
of
such
a
sinner
for
his
sin
there
was
a
man
dwelt
about
miles
off
from
us
that
had
so
trained
up
himself
in
his
atheistical
notions
that
at
last
he
attempted
to
write
a
book
against
jesus
christ
and
against
the
divine
authority
of
the
scriptures
but
i
think
it
was
not
printed
well
after
many
days
god
struck
him
with
sickness
whereof
he
dyed
so
being
sick
and
musing
upon
his
former
doings
the
book
that
he
had
written
came
into
his
mind
and
with
it
such
a
sence
of
his
evil
in
writing
of
it
that
it
tore
his
conscience
as
a
lyon
would
tare
a
kid
he
lay
therefore
upon
his
in
sad
case
and
much
affliction
of
conscience
some
of
my
friends
also
went
to
see
him
and
as
they
were
in
his
chamber
one
day
he
hastily
called
for
pen
ink
and
paper
which
when
it
was
given
him
he
took
it
and
writ
to
this
purpose
picture
take
note
symbol
i
such
an
one
in
such
a
town
must
goe
to
for
writing
a
book
against
jesus
christ
and
against
the
holy
scriptures
and
would
also
have
leaped
out
of
the
window
of
his
house
to
have
killed
himself
but
was
by
them
prevented
of
that
so
he
dyed
in
his
bed
such
a
death
as
it
was
twill
be
well
if
others
take
warning
by
him
atten
this
is
a
remarkable
story
wise
tis
as
true
as
remarkable
i
had
it
from
them
that
i
dare
believe
who
also
themselves
were
eye
and
ear
witnesses
and
also
that
catcht
him
in
their
arms
and
saved
him
when
he
would
have
leaped
out
of
his
to
have
destroyed
himself
atten
well
you
have
told
me
what
were
badmans
thoughts
now
being
sick
of
his
condition
pray
tell
me
also
what
he
then
did
when
he
was
sick
wise
did
he
did
many
things
which
i
am
sure
he
never
thought
to
have
done
and
which
to
be
sure
was
not
looked
for
of
his
wife
and
children
in
this
fit
of
sickness
his
thoughts
were
quite
altered
about
his
wife
i
say
his
thoughts
so
far
as
could
be
judged
by
his
words
and
carriages
to
her
for
now
she
was
his
good
wife
his
godly
wife
his
honest
wife
his
duck
and
dear
and
all
now
he
told
her
that
she
had
the
best
of
it
she
having
a
good
life
to
stand
by
her
while
his
debaucheries
and
ungodly
life
did
always
stare
him
in
the
face
now
he
told
her
the
counsel
that
she
often
gave
him
was
good
though
he
was
so
bad
as
not
to
take
it
now
he
would
hear
her
talk
to
him
and
he
would
lie
sighing
by
her
while
she
so
did
now
he
would
bid
her
pray
for
him
that
he
might
be
delivered
from
hell
he
would
also
now
consent
that
some
of
her
good
ministers
might
come
to
him
to
comfort
him
and
he
would
seem
to
shew
them
kindness
when
they
came
for
he
would
treat
them
kindly
with
words
and
hearken
diligently
to
what
they
said
only
he
did
not
care
that
they
should
talk
much
of
his
ill
spent
life
because
his
conscience
was
clogged
with
that
already
he
cared
not
now
to
see
his
old
companions
the
thoughts
of
them
was
a
torment
to
him
and
now
he
would
speak
kindly
to
that
child
of
his
that
took
after
its
mothers
steps
though
he
could
not
at
all
abide
it
before
he
also
desired
the
prayers
of
good
people
that
god
of
his
mercy
would
spare
him
a
little
longer
promising
that
if
god
would
but
let
him
recover
this
once
what
a
new
what
a
penitent
man
he
would
be
toward
god
and
what
a
loving
husband
he
would
be
to
his
wife
what
liberty
he
would
give
her
yea
how
he
would
goe
with
her
himself
to
hear
her
ministers
and
how
they
should
go
hand
in
hand
in
the
way
to
heaven
together
atten
here
was
a
fine
shew
of
things
i
le
warrant
you
his
wife
was
glad
for
this
wise
his
wife
aie
and
a
many
good
people
besides
it
was
noysed
all
over
the
town
what
a
great
change
there
was
wrought
upon
badman
how
sorry
he
was
for
his
sins
how
he
began
to
love
his
wife
how
he
desired
good
men
should
pray
to
god
to
spare
him
and
what
promises
he
now
made
to
god
in
his
sickness
that
if
ever
he
should
raise
him
from
his
sick
bed
to
health
again
what
a
new
penitent
man
he
would
be
towards
god
and
what
a
loving
husband
to
his
good
wife
well
ministers
prayed
and
good
people
rejoyced
thinking
verily
that
they
now
had
gotten
a
man
from
the
devil
nay
some
of
the
weaker
sort
did
not
stick
to
say
that
god
had
began
a
work
of
grace
in
his
heart
and
his
wife
poor
woman
you
can
not
think
how
apt
she
was
to
believe
it
so
she
rejoyced
and
she
hoped
as
she
would
have
it
but
alas
alas
in
little
time
things
all
proved
otherwise
after
he
had
kept
his
bed
a
while
his
distemper
began
to
abate
and
he
to
feel
himself
better
so
he
in
little
time
was
so
finely
mended
that
he
could
walk
about
the
house
and
also
obtained
a
very
fine
stomach
to
his
food
and
now
did
his
wife
and
her
good
friends
stand
gaping
to
see
badman
fulfill
his
promise
of
becoming
new
towards
god
and
loving
to
his
wife
but
the
contrary
only
shewed
it
self
for
so
soon
as
ever
he
had
hopes
of
mending
and
found
that
his
strength
began
to
renew
his
trouble
began
to
goe
off
his
heart
and
he
grew
as
great
a
stranger
to
his
frights
and
fears
as
if
he
had
never
had
them
but
verily
i
am
apt
to
think
that
one
reason
of
his
no
more
regarding
or
remembring
of
his
fears
and
of
being
no
better
for
them
was
some
words
that
the
doctor
that
supplied
him
with
physick
said
to
him
when
he
was
mending
for
as
soon
as
badman
began
to
mend
the
doctor
comes
and
sits
him
down
by
him
in
his
house
and
there
fell
into
discourse
with
him
about
the
nature
of
his
disease
and
among
other
things
they
talked
of
badmans
trouble
and
how
he
would
cry
out
tremble
and
express
his
fears
of
going
to
hell
when
his
sickness
lay
pretty
hard
upon
him
to
which
the
doctor
replyed
that
those
fears
and
did
arise
from
the
height
of
his
distemper
for
that
disease
was
often
attended
with
lightness
of
the
head
by
reason
the
sick
party
could
not
sleep
and
for
that
the
vapours
disturbed
the
brain
but
you
see
sir
quoth
he
that
so
soon
as
you
got
sleep
and
betook
your
self
to
rest
you
quickly
mended
and
your
head
settled
and
so
those
frenzies
left
you
and
was
it
so
indeed
thought
badman
was
my
troubles
only
the
effects
of
my
distemper
and
because
ill
vapours
got
up
into
my
brain
then
surely
since
my
physician
was
my
saviour
my
lust
again
shall
be
my
god
so
he
never
minded
religion
more
but
betook
him
again
to
the
world
his
lusts
and
wicked
companions
and
there
was
an
end
of
badmans
conversion
atten
i
thought
as
you
told
me
of
him
that
this
would
be
the
result
of
the
whole
for
i
discerned
by
your
relating
of
things
that
the
true
symptoms
of
conversion
were
wanting
in
him
and
that
those
that
appeared
to
be
any
thing
like
them
were
only
such
as
the
reprobates
may
have
wise
you
say
right
for
there
wanted
in
him
when
he
was
most
sensible
a
sence
of
the
pollution
of
his
nature
he
only
had
guilt
for
his
sinful
actions
the
which
cain
and
pharaoh
and
saul
and
judas
those
reprobates
have
had
before
him
besides
the
great
things
that
he
desired
were
to
be
delivered
from
going
to
hell
and
who
would
willingly
and
that
his
life
might
be
lengthened
in
this
world
we
find
not
by
all
that
he
said
or
did
that
jesus
christ
the
saviour
was
desired
by
him
from
a
sence
of
his
need
of
his
righteousness
to
cloath
him
and
of
his
spirit
to
sanctifie
him
his
own
strength
was
whole
in
him
he
saw
nothing
of
the
treachery
of
his
own
heart
for
had
he
he
would
never
have
been
so
free
to
make
promises
to
god
of
amendment
he
would
rather
have
been
afraid
that
if
he
had
mended
he
should
have
turned
with
the
dog
to
his
vomit
and
have
begged
prayers
of
saints
and
assistance
from
heaven
upon
that
account
that
he
might
have
been
kept
from
doing
so
tis
true
he
did
beg
prayers
of
good
people
and
so
did
pharaoh
of
moses
and
aaron
and
simon
magus
of
simon
peter
his
mind
also
seemed
to
be
turned
to
his
wife
and
child
but
alas
twas
rather
from
conviction
that
god
had
given
him
concerning
their
happy
estate
over
his
than
for
that
he
had
any
true
love
to
the
work
of
god
that
was
in
them
true
some
shews
of
kindness
he
seemed
to
have
for
them
and
so
had
rich
dives
when
in
hell
to
his
five
brethren
that
were
yet
in
the
world
yea
he
had
such
love
as
to
wish
them
in
heaven
that
they
might
not
come
thither
to
be
tormented
atten
repentance
is
seldom
good
for
any
thing
wise
you
say
true
it
is
very
rarely
good
for
any
thing
indeed
death
is
unwelcom
to
nature
and
usually
when
sickness
and
death
visit
the
sinner
the
first
taking
of
him
by
the
shoulder
and
the
second
standing
at
the
door
to
receive
him
then
the
sinner
begins
to
look
about
him
and
to
bethink
with
himself
these
will
have
me
away
before
god
and
i
know
that
my
life
has
not
been
as
it
should
how
shall
i
do
to
appear
before
god
or
if
it
be
more
the
sence
of
the
punishment
and
the
place
of
the
punishment
of
sinners
that
also
is
starting
to
a
defiled
conscience
now
rouzed
by
deaths
lumbring
at
the
door
and
hence
usually
is
repentance
and
the
matter
of
it
to
wit
to
be
saved
from
hell
and
from
death
and
that
god
will
restore
again
to
health
till
they
mend
concluding
that
it
is
in
their
power
to
mend
as
is
evident
by
their
large
and
lavishing
promises
to
do
it
i
have
known
many
that
when
they
have
been
sick
have
had
large
measures
of
this
kind
of
repentance
and
while
it
has
lasted
the
noyse
and
sound
thereof
has
made
the
town
to
ring
again
but
alas
how
long
has
it
lasted
scarce
so
long
as
untill
the
party
now
sick
has
been
well
it
has
passed
away
like
a
mist
or
a
vapour
it
has
been
a
thing
of
no
continuance
but
this
kind
of
repentance
is
by
god
compared
to
the
howling
of
a
dog
and
they
have
not
cried
unto
me
with
their
heart
when
they
howled
upon
their
bed
atten
yet
one
may
see
by
this
the
desperateness
of
mans
heart
for
what
is
it
but
desperate
wickedness
to
make
promise
to
god
of
amendment
if
he
will
but
spare
them
and
yet
so
soon
as
they
are
recovered
or
quickly
after
fall
to
sin
as
they
did
before
and
never
to
regard
their
promise
more
wise
it
is
a
sign
of
desperateness
indeed
yea
of
desperate
madness
for
surely
they
must
needs
think
that
god
took
notice
of
their
promise
that
he
heard
the
words
that
they
spake
and
that
he
hath
laid
them
up
against
the
time
to
come
and
will
then
bring
out
and
testifie
to
their
faces
that
they
flattered
him
with
their
mouth
and
lyed
unto
him
with
their
tongue
when
they
lay
sick
to
their
thinking
upon
their
and
promised
him
that
if
he
would
recover
them
they
would
repent
and
amend
their
ways
but
thus
as
i
have
told
you
badman
did
he
made
great
promises
that
he
would
be
a
new
man
that
he
would
leave
his
sins
and
become
a
convert
that
he
would
love
his
godly
wife
yea
many
fine
words
had
badman
in
his
sickness
but
no
good
actions
when
he
was
well
atten
and
how
did
his
good
wife
take
it
when
she
saw
that
he
had
no
amendment
but
that
he
returned
with
the
dog
to
his
vomit
to
his
old
courses
again
wise
why
it
broke
her
heart
it
was
a
worse
disappointment
to
her
than
the
cheat
that
he
gave
her
in
marriage
at
least
she
laid
it
more
to
heart
and
could
not
so
well
grapple
with
it
you
must
think
that
she
had
put
up
many
a
prayer
to
god
for
him
before
even
all
the
time
that
he
had
carried
it
so
badly
to
her
and
now
when
he
was
so
affrighted
in
his
sickness
and
so
desired
that
he
might
live
and
mend
poor
woman
she
thought
that
the
time
was
come
for
god
to
answer
her
prayers
nay
she
did
not
let
with
gladness
to
whisper
it
out
amongst
her
friends
that
twas
so
but
when
she
saw
her
self
disappointed
by
her
husbands
turning
rebel
again
she
could
not
stand
up
under
it
but
falls
into
a
languishing
distemper
and
in
a
few
weeks
gave
up
the
ghost
atten
pray
how
did
she
dye
wise
die
she
dyed
bravely
full
of
comfort
of
the
faith
of
her
interest
in
christ
and
by
him
of
the
world
to
come
she
had
many
brave
expressions
in
her
sickness
and
gave
to
those
that
came
to
visit
her
many
signs
of
her
salvation
the
thoughts
of
the
grave
but
specially
of
her
rising
again
were
sweet
thoughts
to
her
she
would
long
for
death
because
she
knew
it
would
be
her
friend
she
behaved
her
self
like
to
some
that
were
making
of
them
ready
to
go
meet
their
bridegroom
now
said
she
i
am
going
to
rest
from
my
sorrows
my
sighs
my
tears
my
mournings
and
complaints
i
have
heretofore
longed
to
be
among
the
saints
but
might
by
no
means
be
suffered
to
goe
but
now
i
am
going
and
no
man
can
stop
me
to
the
great
meeting
to
the
general
assembly
and
church
of
the
which
are
written
in
heaven
there
i
shall
have
my
hearts
desire
there
i
shall
worship
without
temptation
or
other
impediment
there
i
shall
see
the
face
of
my
jesus
whom
i
have
loved
whom
i
have
served
and
who
now
i
know
will
save
my
soul
i
have
prayed
often
for
my
husband
that
he
might
be
converted
but
there
has
been
no
answer
of
god
in
that
matter
are
my
prayers
lost
are
they
forgotten
are
they
thrown
over
the
barr
no
they
are
hanged
upon
the
horns
of
the
golden
altar
and
i
must
have
the
benefit
of
them
my
self
that
moment
that
i
shall
enter
into
the
gates
in
at
which
the
righteous
nation
that
keepeth
truth
shall
enter
i
say
i
shall
have
the
benefit
of
them
i
can
say
as
holy
david
i
say
i
can
say
of
my
husband
as
he
could
of
his
enemies
as
for
me
when
they
were
sick
my
cloathing
was
of
i
humbled
my
soul
with
fasting
and
my
prayer
returned
into
my
bosom
my
prayers
are
not
lost
my
tears
are
yet
in
god
s
bottle
i
would
have
had
a
crown
and
glory
for
my
husband
and
for
those
of
my
children
that
follow
his
steps
but
so
far
as
i
can
see
yet
i
must
rest
in
the
hope
of
having
all
my
self
atten
did
she
talk
thus
openly
wise
no
this
she
spake
but
to
one
or
two
of
her
most
intimate
acquaintance
who
were
permitted
to
come
and
see
her
when
she
lay
languishing
upon
her
atten
well
but
pray
go
on
in
your
relation
this
is
good
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
this
is
as
a
cordial
to
my
heart
while
we
sit
thus
talking
under
this
tree
wise
when
she
drew
near
her
end
she
called
for
her
husband
and
when
he
was
come
to
her
she
told
him
that
now
he
and
she
must
part
and
said
she
god
knows
and
thou
shalt
know
that
i
have
been
a
loving
faithful
wife
unto
thee
my
prayers
have
been
many
for
thee
and
as
for
all
the
abuses
that
i
have
received
at
thy
hand
those
i
freely
and
heartily
forgive
and
still
shall
pray
for
thy
conversion
even
as
long
as
i
breathe
in
this
world
but
husband
i
am
going
thither
where
no
bad
man
shall
come
and
if
thou
dost
not
convert
thou
wilt
never
see
me
more
with
comfort
let
not
my
plain
words
offend
thee
i
am
thy
dying
wife
and
of
my
faithfulness
to
thee
would
leave
this
exhortation
with
thee
break
off
thy
sins
fly
to
god
for
mercy
while
mercies
gate
stands
open
remember
that
the
day
is
coming
when
thou
though
now
lusty
and
well
must
lye
at
the
gates
of
death
as
i
do
and
what
wilt
thou
then
do
if
thou
shalt
be
found
with
a
naked
soul
to
meet
with
the
cherubims
with
their
flaming
swords
yea
what
wilt
thou
then
do
if
death
and
hell
shall
come
to
visit
thee
and
thou
in
thy
sins
and
under
the
curse
of
the
law
atten
this
was
honest
and
plain
but
what
said
badman
to
her
wise
he
did
what
he
could
to
divert
her
talk
by
throwing
in
other
things
he
also
shewed
some
kind
of
pity
to
her
now
and
would
ask
her
what
she
would
have
and
with
various
kind
of
words
put
her
out
of
her
talk
for
when
she
see
that
she
was
not
regarded
she
fetcht
a
deep
sigh
and
lay
still
so
he
went
down
and
then
she
called
for
her
children
and
began
to
talk
to
them
and
first
she
spake
to
those
that
were
rude
and
told
them
the
danger
of
dying
before
they
had
grace
in
their
hearts
she
told
them
also
that
death
might
be
nearer
them
than
they
were
aware
of
and
bid
them
look
when
they
went
through
the
again
if
there
was
not
little
graves
there
and
ah
children
said
she
will
it
not
be
dreadful
to
you
if
we
only
shall
meet
at
the
day
of
judgment
and
then
part
again
and
never
see
each
other
more
and
with
that
she
wept
the
children
also
wept
so
she
held
on
her
discourse
children
said
she
i
am
going
from
you
i
am
going
to
jesus
christ
and
with
him
there
is
neither
sorrow
nor
sighing
nor
pain
nor
tears
nor
death
thither
would
i
have
you
go
also
but
i
can
neither
carry
you
nor
fetch
you
thither
but
if
you
shall
turn
from
your
sins
to
god
and
shall
beg
mercy
at
his
hands
by
jesus
christ
you
shall
follow
me
and
shall
when
you
dye
come
to
the
place
where
i
am
going
that
blessed
place
of
rest
and
then
we
shall
be
for
ever
together
beholding
the
face
of
our
redeemer
to
our
mutual
and
eternal
joy
so
she
bid
them
remember
the
words
of
a
dying
mother
when
she
was
cold
in
her
grave
and
themselves
were
hot
in
their
sins
if
perhaps
her
words
might
put
check
to
their
vice
and
that
they
might
remember
and
turn
to
god
then
they
all
went
down
but
her
darling
to
wit
the
child
that
she
had
most
love
for
because
it
followed
her
ways
so
she
addressed
her
self
to
that
come
to
me
said
she
my
sweet
child
thou
art
the
child
of
my
joy
i
have
lived
to
see
thee
a
servant
of
god
thou
shalt
have
eternal
life
i
my
sweet
heart
shall
goe
before
and
thou
shalt
follow
after
if
thou
shalt
hold
the
beginning
of
thy
confidence
stedfast
to
the
end
when
i
am
gone
do
thou
still
remember
my
words
love
thy
bible
follow
my
ministers
deny
ungodliness
still
and
if
troublous
times
shall
come
set
an
higher
price
upon
christ
his
word
and
wayes
and
the
testimony
of
a
good
conscience
than
upon
all
the
world
besides
carry
it
kindly
and
dutifully
to
thy
father
but
choose
none
of
his
ways
if
thou
mayest
goe
to
service
choose
that
rather
than
to
stay
at
home
but
then
be
sure
to
choose
a
service
where
thou
mayest
be
helped
forwards
in
the
way
to
heaven
and
that
thou
mayest
have
such
a
service
speak
to
my
minister
he
will
help
thee
if
possible
to
such
an
one
i
would
have
thee
also
my
dear
child
to
love
thy
brothers
and
sisters
but
learn
none
of
their
naughty
tricks
have
no
fellowship
with
the
unfruitfull
works
of
darkness
but
rather
reprove
them
thou
hast
grace
they
have
none
do
thou
therefore
beautifie
the
way
of
salvation
before
their
eyes
by
a
godly
life
and
conformable
conversation
to
the
revealed
will
of
god
that
thy
brothers
and
sisters
may
see
and
be
the
more
pleased
with
the
good
wayes
of
the
lord
if
thou
shalt
live
to
marry
take
heed
of
being
served
as
i
was
that
is
of
being
beguiled
with
fair
words
and
the
flatteries
of
a
lying
tongue
but
first
be
sure
of
godliness
yea
as
sure
as
it
is
possible
for
one
to
be
in
this
world
trust
not
thine
own
eyes
nor
thine
own
judgment
i
mean
as
to
that
persons
godliness
that
thou
art
invited
to
marry
ask
counsel
of
good
men
and
do
nothing
therein
if
he
lives
without
my
ministers
advice
i
have
also
my
self
desired
him
to
look
after
thee
thus
she
talked
to
her
children
and
gave
them
counsel
and
after
she
had
talked
to
this
a
little
longer
she
kiss
d
it
and
bid
it
go
down
well
in
short
her
time
drew
on
and
the
day
that
she
must
die
so
she
died
with
a
soul
full
of
grace
an
heart
full
of
comfort
and
by
her
death
ended
a
life
full
of
trouble
her
husband
made
a
funerall
for
her
perhaps
because
he
was
glad
he
was
rid
of
her
but
we
will
leave
that
to
be
manifest
at
judgment
atten
this
woman
died
well
and
now
we
are
talking
of
the
dying
of
christians
i
will
tell
you
a
story
of
one
that
died
some
time
since
in
our
town
the
man
was
a
godly
old
puritan
for
so
the
godly
were
called
in
time
past
this
man
after
a
long
and
godly
life
fell
sick
of
the
sickness
whereof
he
died
and
as
he
lay
drawing
on
the
woman
that
looked
to
him
thought
she
heard
musick
and
that
the
sweetest
that
ever
she
heard
in
her
life
which
also
continued
untill
he
gave
up
the
ghost
picture
take
note
symbol
now
when
his
soul
departed
from
him
the
musick
seemed
to
withdraw
and
to
go
further
and
further
off
from
the
house
and
so
it
went
untill
the
sound
was
quite
gone
out
of
hearing
wise
what
do
you
think
that
might
be
atten
for
ought
i
know
the
melodious
notes
of
angels
that
were
sent
of
god
to
fetch
him
to
heaven
wise
i
can
not
say
but
that
god
goes
out
of
his
ordinary
road
with
us
poor
mortals
sometimes
i
can
not
say
this
of
this
woman
but
yet
she
had
better
musick
in
her
heart
than
sounded
in
this
womans
ears
atten
i
believe
so
but
pray
tell
me
did
any
of
her
other
children
hearken
to
her
words
so
as
to
be
bettered
in
their
souls
thereby
wise
one
of
them
did
and
became
a
very
hopefull
young
man
but
for
the
rest
i
can
say
nothing
atten
and
what
did
badman
do
after
his
wife
was
dead
wise
why
even
as
he
did
before
he
scarce
mourned
a
fortnight
for
her
and
his
mourning
then
was
i
doubt
more
in
fashion
than
in
heart
atten
would
he
not
sometimes
talk
of
his
wife
when
she
was
dead
wise
yes
when
the
fit
took
him
and
could
commend
her
too
extremely
saying
she
was
a
good
godly
vertuous
woman
but
this
is
not
a
thing
to
be
wondred
at
it
is
common
with
wicked
men
to
hate
gods
servants
while
alive
and
to
commend
them
when
they
are
dead
so
served
the
pharisees
the
prophets
those
of
the
prophets
that
were
dead
they
commended
and
those
of
them
that
were
alive
they
condemned
atten
but
did
not
badman
marry
again
quickly
wise
no
not
a
good
while
after
and
when
he
was
asked
the
reason
he
would
make
this
slighty
answer
who
would
keep
a
cow
of
their
own
that
can
have
a
quart
of
milk
for
a
penny
meaning
who
would
be
at
the
charge
to
have
a
wife
that
can
have
a
whore
when
he
listeth
so
villanous
so
abominable
did
he
continue
after
the
death
of
his
wife
yet
at
last
there
was
one
was
too
hard
for
him
for
getting
of
him
to
her
upon
a
time
and
making
of
him
sufficiently
drunk
she
was
so
cunning
as
to
get
a
promise
of
marriage
of
him
and
so
held
him
to
it
and
forced
him
to
marry
her
and
she
as
the
saying
is
was
as
good
as
he
at
all
his
vile
and
ranting
tricks
she
had
her
companions
as
well
as
he
had
his
and
she
would
meet
them
too
at
the
tavern
and
more
commonly
than
he
was
aware
of
to
be
plain
she
was
a
very
whore
and
had
as
great
resort
came
to
her
where
time
and
place
was
appointed
as
any
of
them
all
aie
and
he
smelt
it
too
but
could
not
tell
how
to
help
it
for
if
he
began
to
talk
she
could
lay
in
his
dish
the
whores
that
she
knew
he
haunted
and
she
could
fit
him
also
with
cursing
and
swearing
for
she
would
give
him
oath
for
oath
and
curse
for
curse
atten
what
kind
of
oaths
would
she
have
wise
why
damn
her
and
sink
her
and
the
like
atten
these
are
provoking
things
wise
so
they
are
but
god
doth
not
altogether
let
such
things
goe
unpunished
in
this
life
something
of
this
i
have
shewed
you
already
and
will
here
give
you
one
or
two
instances
more
there
lived
saith
one
in
the
year
in
a
city
of
savoy
a
man
who
was
a
monstrous
curser
and
swearer
and
though
he
was
often
admonished
and
blamed
for
it
yet
would
he
by
no
means
mend
his
manners
at
length
a
great
plague
happening
in
the
city
he
withdrew
himself
into
a
garden
where
being
again
admonished
to
give
over
his
wickedness
he
hardned
his
heart
more
swearing
blaspheming
god
and
giving
himself
to
the
devil
and
immediately
the
devil
snatched
him
up
suddenly
his
wife
and
kinswoman
looking
on
and
carried
him
quite
away
the
magistrates
advertised
hereof
went
to
the
place
and
examined
the
woman
who
justified
the
truth
of
it
also
at
oster
in
the
dutchy
of
magalapole
saith
clark
a
wicked
woman
used
in
her
cursing
to
give
herself
body
and
soul
to
the
devil
and
being
reproved
for
it
still
continued
the
same
till
being
at
a
the
devil
came
in
person
and
carried
her
up
into
the
air
with
most
horrible
outcries
and
roarings
and
in
that
sort
carried
her
round
about
the
town
that
the
inhabitants
were
ready
to
dye
for
fear
and
by
and
by
he
tore
her
in
four
pieces
leaving
her
four
quarters
in
four
several
and
then
brought
her
bowels
to
the
and
threw
them
upon
the
table
before
the
maior
of
the
town
saying
behold
these
dishes
of
meat
belong
to
thee
whom
the
like
destruction
waiteth
for
if
thou
dost
not
amend
thy
wicked
life
atten
though
god
forbears
to
deal
thus
with
all
men
that
thus
rend
and
tare
his
name
and
that
immediate
judgments
do
not
overtake
them
yet
he
makes
their
lives
by
other
judgments
bitter
to
them
does
he
not
wise
yes
yes
and
for
proof
i
need
goe
no
further
than
to
this
badman
and
his
wife
for
their
railing
and
cursing
and
swearing
ended
not
in
words
they
would
fight
and
fly
at
each
other
and
that
like
cats
and
dogs
but
it
must
be
looked
upon
as
the
hand
and
judgment
of
god
upon
him
for
his
villany
he
had
an
honest
woman
before
but
she
would
not
serve
his
turn
and
therefore
god
took
her
away
and
gave
him
one
as
bad
as
himself
thus
that
measure
that
he
meted
to
his
first
wife
this
last
did
mete
to
him
again
and
this
is
a
punishment
wherewith
sometimes
god
will
punish
wicked
men
so
said
amos
to
amaziah
thy
wife
shall
be
an
harlot
in
the
city
with
this
last
wife
badman
lived
a
pretty
while
but
as
i
told
you
before
in
a
most
sad
and
hellish
manner
and
now
he
would
bewail
his
first
wifes
death
not
of
love
that
he
had
to
her
godliness
for
that
he
could
never
abide
but
for
that
she
used
alwayes
to
keep
home
whereas
this
would
goe
abroad
his
first
wife
was
also
honest
and
true
to
that
relation
but
this
last
was
a
whore
of
her
body
the
first
woman
loved
to
keep
things
together
but
this
last
would
whirl
them
about
as
well
as
he
the
first
would
be
silent
when
he
chid
and
would
take
it
patiently
when
he
abused
her
but
this
would
give
him
word
for
word
blow
for
blow
curse
for
curse
so
that
now
badman
had
met
with
his
match
god
had
a
mind
to
make
him
see
the
baseness
of
his
own
life
in
the
wickedness
of
his
wives
but
all
would
not
do
with
badman
he
would
be
badman
still
this
judgment
did
not
work
any
reformation
upon
him
no
not
to
god
nor
man
atten
i
warrant
you
that
badman
thought
when
his
wife
was
dead
that
next
time
he
would
match
far
better
wise
what
he
thought
i
can
not
tell
but
he
could
not
hope
for
it
in
this
match
for
here
he
knew
himself
to
be
catcht
he
knew
that
he
was
by
this
woman
intangled
and
would
therefore
have
gone
back
again
but
could
not
he
knew
her
i
say
to
be
a
whore
before
and
therefore
could
not
promise
himself
a
happy
life
with
her
for
he
or
she
that
will
not
be
true
to
their
own
soul
will
neither
be
true
to
husband
nor
wife
and
he
knew
that
she
was
not
true
to
her
own
soul
and
therefore
could
not
expect
she
should
be
true
to
him
but
solomon
says
an
whore
is
a
deep
pit
and
badman
found
it
true
for
when
she
had
caught
him
in
her
pit
she
would
never
leave
him
till
she
had
got
him
to
promise
her
marriage
and
when
she
had
taken
him
so
far
she
forced
him
to
marry
indeed
and
after
that
they
lived
that
life
that
i
have
told
you
atten
but
did
not
the
neighbours
take
notice
of
this
alteration
that
badman
had
made
wise
yes
and
many
of
his
neighbours
yea
many
of
those
that
were
carnal
said
tis
a
righteous
judgment
of
god
upon
him
for
his
abusive
carriage
and
language
to
his
other
wife
for
they
were
all
convinced
that
she
was
a
vertuous
woman
and
he
vile
wretch
had
killed
her
i
will
not
say
with
but
with
the
want
of
kindness
atten
and
how
long
i
pray
did
they
live
thus
together
wise
some
fourteen
or
sixteen
years
even
untill
though
she
also
brought
somthing
with
her
they
had
sinned
all
away
and
parted
as
poor
as
howlets
and
in
reason
how
could
it
be
otherwise
he
would
have
his
way
and
she
would
have
hers
he
among
his
companions
and
she
among
hers
he
with
his
whores
and
she
with
her
rogues
and
so
they
brought
their
noble
to
atten
pray
of
what
disease
did
badman
die
for
now
i
perceive
we
are
come
up
to
his
death
wise
i
can
not
so
properly
say
that
he
died
of
one
disease
for
there
were
many
that
had
consented
and
laid
their
heads
together
to
bring
him
to
his
end
he
was
dropsical
he
was
consumptive
he
was
surfeited
was
gouty
and
as
some
say
he
had
a
tang
of
the
pox
in
his
bowels
yet
the
captain
of
all
these
men
of
death
that
came
against
him
to
take
him
away
was
the
consumption
for
twas
that
that
brought
him
down
to
the
grave
atten
although
i
will
not
say
but
the
best
men
may
die
of
a
consumption
a
dropsie
or
a
surfeit
yea
that
these
may
meet
upon
a
man
to
end
him
yet
i
will
say
again
that
many
times
these
diseases
come
through
mans
inordinate
use
of
things
much
drinking
brings
dropsies
consumptions
surfeits
and
many
other
diseases
and
i
doubt
that
badman
s
death
did
come
by
his
abuse
of
himself
in
the
use
of
lawfull
and
unlawfull
things
i
ground
this
my
sentence
upon
that
report
of
his
life
that
you
at
large
have
given
me
wise
i
think
verily
that
you
need
not
call
back
your
sentence
for
tis
thought
by
many
that
by
his
cups
and
his
queans
he
brought
himself
to
this
his
destruction
he
was
not
an
old
man
when
he
dyed
nor
was
he
naturally
very
feeble
but
strong
and
of
a
healthy
complexion
yet
as
i
said
he
moultered
away
and
went
when
he
set
a
going
rotten
to
his
grave
and
that
which
made
him
stink
when
he
was
dead
i
mean
that
made
him
stink
in
his
name
and
fame
was
that
he
died
with
a
spice
of
the
foul
disease
upon
him
a
man
whose
life
was
full
of
sin
and
whose
death
was
without
repentance
atten
these
were
blemishes
sufficient
to
make
him
stink
indeed
wise
they
were
so
and
they
did
do
it
no
man
could
speak
well
of
him
when
he
was
gone
his
name
rotted
above
ground
as
his
carkass
rotted
under
and
this
is
according
to
the
saying
of
the
wise
man
the
memory
of
the
just
is
blessed
but
the
name
of
the
wicked
shall
rot
this
text
in
both
the
parts
of
it
was
fulfilled
upon
him
and
the
woman
that
he
married
first
for
her
name
still
did
flourish
though
she
had
been
dead
almost
seventeen
years
but
his
began
to
stink
and
rot
before
he
had
been
buried
seventeen
dayes
atten
that
man
that
dieth
with
a
life
full
of
sin
and
with
an
heart
void
of
repentance
although
he
should
die
of
the
most
golden
disease
if
there
were
any
that
might
be
so
called
i
will
warrant
him
his
name
shall
stink
and
that
in
heaven
and
earth
wise
you
say
true
and
therefore
doth
the
name
of
cain
pharaoh
saul
judas
and
the
pharisees
though
dead
thousands
of
years
agoe
stink
as
fresh
in
the
nostrils
of
the
world
as
if
they
were
but
newly
dead
atten
i
do
fully
acquiesce
with
you
in
this
but
sir
since
you
have
charged
him
with
dying
impenitent
pray
let
me
see
how
you
will
prove
it
not
that
i
altogether
doubt
it
because
you
have
affirmed
it
but
yet
i
love
to
have
proof
for
what
men
say
in
such
weighty
matters
wise
when
i
said
he
died
without
repentance
i
meant
so
far
as
those
that
knew
him
could
judge
when
they
compared
his
life
the
word
and
his
death
together
atten
well
said
they
went
the
right
way
to
find
out
whether
he
had
that
is
did
manifest
that
he
had
repentance
or
no
now
then
shew
me
how
they
did
prove
he
had
none
wise
so
i
will
and
first
this
was
urged
to
prove
it
he
had
not
in
all
the
time
of
his
sickness
a
sight
and
sence
of
his
sins
but
was
as
secure
and
as
much
at
quiet
as
if
he
had
never
sinned
in
all
his
life
atten
i
must
needs
confess
that
this
is
a
sign
he
had
none
for
how
can
a
man
repent
of
that
of
which
he
hath
neither
sight
nor
sence
but
tis
strange
that
he
had
neither
sight
nor
sence
of
sin
now
when
he
had
such
a
sight
and
sence
of
his
evil
before
i
mean
when
he
was
sick
before
wise
he
was
as
i
said
as
secure
now
as
if
he
had
been
as
sinless
as
an
angel
though
all
men
knew
what
a
sinner
he
was
for
he
carried
his
sins
in
his
forehead
his
debauched
life
was
read
and
known
of
all
men
but
his
reputation
was
read
and
known
of
no
man
for
as
i
said
he
had
none
and
for
ought
i
know
the
reason
he
had
no
sence
of
his
sins
now
was
because
he
profited
not
by
that
sence
that
he
had
of
them
before
he
liked
not
to
retain
that
knowledge
of
god
then
that
caused
his
sins
to
come
to
remembrance
therefore
god
gave
him
up
now
to
a
reprobate
mind
to
hardness
and
stupidity
of
spirit
and
so
was
that
scripture
fulfilled
upon
him
he
hath
blinded
their
eyes
and
that
let
their
eyes
be
darkned
that
they
may
not
see
oh
for
a
man
to
live
in
sin
and
to
go
out
of
the
world
without
repentance
for
it
is
the
saddest
judgement
that
can
overtake
a
man
atten
but
sir
although
both
you
and
i
have
consented
that
without
a
sight
and
sence
of
sin
there
can
be
no
repentance
yet
that
is
but
our
bare
let
us
therefore
now
see
if
by
the
scripture
we
can
make
it
good
wise
that
is
easily
done
the
three
thousand
that
were
converted
acts
the
second
repented
not
till
they
had
sight
and
sence
of
their
sins
paul
repented
not
till
he
had
sight
and
sence
of
his
sins
the
jailor
repented
not
till
he
had
sight
and
sence
of
his
sins
nor
could
they
for
of
what
should
a
man
repent
the
answer
is
of
sin
what
is
it
to
repent
of
sin
the
answer
is
to
be
sorry
for
it
to
turn
from
it
but
how
can
a
man
be
sorry
for
it
that
has
neither
sight
nor
sence
of
it
david
did
not
only
commit
sins
but
abode
impenitent
for
them
untill
nathan
the
prophet
was
sent
from
god
to
give
him
a
sight
and
sence
of
them
and
then
but
not
till
then
he
indeed
repented
of
them
job
in
order
to
his
repentance
cries
unto
god
shew
me
wherefore
thou
contendest
with
me
and
again
that
which
i
see
not
teach
thou
me
i
have
born
chastisement
i
will
not
offend
any
more
that
is
not
in
what
i
know
for
i
will
repent
of
it
nor
yet
in
what
i
know
not
when
thou
shalt
shew
me
it
also
ephraims
repentance
was
after
he
was
turned
to
the
sight
and
sence
of
his
sins
and
after
he
was
instructed
about
the
evil
of
them
atten
these
are
good
testimonies
of
this
truth
and
doe
if
matter
of
fact
with
which
badman
is
charged
be
true
prove
indeed
that
he
did
not
repent
but
as
he
lived
so
he
dyed
in
his
sin
for
without
repentance
a
man
is
sure
to
dye
in
his
sin
for
they
will
lie
down
in
the
dust
with
him
rise
at
the
judgement
with
him
hang
about
his
neck
like
cords
and
chains
when
he
standeth
at
the
barre
of
gods
tribunal
and
goe
with
him
too
when
he
goes
away
from
the
with
a
depart
from
me
ye
cursed
into
everlasting
fire
prepared
for
the
devil
and
his
angels
and
there
shall
fret
and
gnaw
his
conscience
because
they
will
be
to
him
a
worm
wise
you
say
well
and
i
will
add
a
word
or
two
more
to
what
i
have
said
repentance
as
it
is
not
produced
without
a
sight
and
sence
of
sin
so
every
sight
and
sence
of
sin
can
not
produce
it
i
mean
every
sight
and
sence
of
sin
can
not
produce
that
repentance
that
is
repentance
unto
salvation
repentance
never
to
be
repented
of
for
it
is
yet
fresh
before
us
that
badman
had
a
sight
and
sence
of
sin
in
that
fit
of
sickness
that
he
had
before
but
it
dyed
without
procuring
any
such
godly
fruit
as
was
manifest
by
his
so
soon
returning
with
the
dog
to
his
vomit
many
people
think
also
that
repentance
stands
in
confession
of
sin
only
but
they
are
very
much
mistaken
for
repentance
as
was
said
before
is
a
being
sorry
for
and
a
turning
from
transgression
to
god
by
jesus
christ
now
if
this
be
true
that
every
sight
and
sence
of
sin
will
not
produce
repentance
then
repentance
can
not
be
produced
there
where
there
is
no
sight
and
sence
of
sin
that
every
sight
and
sence
of
sin
will
not
produce
repentance
to
wit
the
godly
repentance
that
we
are
speaking
of
is
manifest
in
cain
pharaoh
saul
and
judas
who
all
of
them
had
sence
great
sence
of
sin
but
none
of
them
repentance
unto
life
now
i
conclude
that
badman
did
die
impenitent
and
so
a
death
most
miserable
atten
but
pray
now
before
we
conclude
our
discourse
of
badman
give
me
another
proof
of
his
dying
in
his
sins
wise
another
proof
is
this
he
did
not
desire
a
sight
and
sence
of
sins
that
he
might
have
repentance
for
them
did
i
say
he
did
not
desire
it
i
will
add
he
greatly
desired
to
remain
in
his
security
and
that
i
shall
prove
by
that
which
follows
first
he
could
not
endure
that
any
man
now
should
talk
to
him
of
his
sinfull
life
and
yet
that
was
the
way
to
beget
a
sight
and
sence
of
sin
and
so
of
repentance
from
it
in
his
soul
but
i
say
he
could
not
endure
such
discourse
those
men
that
did
offer
to
talk
unto
him
of
his
life
they
were
as
little
welcome
to
him
in
the
time
of
his
last
sickness
as
was
elijah
when
he
went
to
meet
with
ahab
as
he
went
down
to
take
possession
of
naboths
vineyard
hast
thou
found
me
said
ahab
o
mine
enemy
so
would
badman
say
in
his
heart
to
and
of
those
that
thus
did
come
to
him
though
indeed
they
came
even
of
love
to
convince
him
of
his
evil
life
that
he
might
have
repented
thereof
and
have
obtained
mercy
atten
did
good
men
then
goe
to
see
him
in
his
last
sickness
wise
yes
those
that
were
his
first
wifes
acquaintance
they
went
to
see
him
and
to
talk
with
and
to
him
if
perhaps
he
might
now
at
last
bethink
himself
and
cry
to
god
for
mercy
atten
they
did
well
to
try
now
at
last
if
they
could
save
his
soul
from
hell
but
pray
how
can
you
tell
that
he
did
not
care
for
the
company
of
such
wise
because
of
the
differing
carriage
that
he
had
for
them
from
what
he
had
when
his
old
carnal
companions
came
to
see
him
when
his
old
campanions
came
to
see
him
he
would
stir
up
himself
as
much
as
he
could
both
by
words
and
looks
to
signifie
they
were
welcome
to
him
he
would
also
talk
with
them
freely
and
look
pleasantly
upon
them
though
the
talk
of
such
could
be
none
other
but
such
as
david
said
carnal
men
would
offer
to
him
when
they
came
to
visit
him
in
his
sickness
if
he
comes
to
see
me
says
he
he
speaketh
vanity
his
heart
gathereth
iniquity
to
itself
but
these
kind
of
talks
i
say
badman
better
brooked
than
he
did
the
company
of
better
men
but
i
will
more
particularly
give
you
a
character
of
his
carriage
to
good
men
and
good
talk
when
they
came
to
see
him
when
they
were
come
he
would
seem
to
fail
in
his
spirits
at
the
sight
of
them
he
would
not
care
to
answer
them
to
any
of
those
questions
that
they
would
at
times
put
to
him
to
feel
what
sence
he
had
of
sin
death
hell
and
judgment
but
would
either
say
nothing
or
answer
them
by
way
of
evasion
or
else
by
telling
of
them
he
was
so
weak
and
spent
that
he
could
not
speak
much
he
would
never
shew
forwardness
to
speak
to
or
talk
with
them
but
was
glad
when
they
held
their
tongues
he
would
ask
them
no
question
about
his
state
and
another
world
or
how
he
should
escape
that
damnation
that
he
had
deserved
he
had
got
a
haunt
at
last
to
bid
his
wife
and
keeper
when
these
good
people
attempted
to
come
to
see
him
to
tell
them
that
he
was
asleep
or
inclining
to
sleep
or
so
weak
for
want
thereof
that
he
could
not
abyde
any
noyse
and
so
they
would
serve
them
time
after
time
till
at
last
they
were
discouraged
from
coming
to
see
him
any
more
he
was
so
hardned
now
in
this
time
of
his
sickness
that
he
would
talk
when
his
companions
came
unto
him
to
the
disparagement
of
those
good
men
and
of
their
good
doctrine
too
that
of
love
did
come
to
see
him
and
that
did
labour
to
convert
him
when
these
good
men
went
away
from
him
he
would
never
say
pray
when
will
you
be
pleased
to
come
again
for
i
have
a
desire
to
more
of
your
company
and
to
hear
more
of
your
good
instruction
no
not
a
word
of
that
but
when
they
were
going
would
scarce
bid
them
drink
or
say
thank
you
for
your
good
company
and
good
instruction
his
talk
in
his
sickness
with
his
companions
would
be
of
the
world
as
trades
houses
lands
great
men
great
titles
great
places
outward
prosperity
or
outward
adversity
or
some
such
carnal
thing
by
all
which
i
conclude
that
he
did
not
desire
a
sence
and
sight
of
his
sin
that
he
might
repent
and
be
saved
atten
it
must
needs
be
so
as
you
say
if
these
things
be
true
that
you
have
asserted
of
him
and
i
do
the
rather
believe
them
because
i
think
you
dare
not
tell
a
lie
of
the
dead
wise
i
was
one
of
them
that
went
to
him
and
that
beheld
his
carriage
and
manner
of
way
and
this
is
a
true
relation
of
it
that
i
have
given
you
atten
i
am
satisfied
but
pray
if
you
can
shew
me
now
by
the
word
what
sentence
of
god
doth
pass
upon
such
men
wise
why
the
man
that
is
thus
averse
to
repentance
that
desires
not
to
hear
of
his
sins
that
he
might
repent
and
be
saved
is
said
to
be
a
man
that
saith
unto
god
depart
from
me
for
i
desire
not
the
knowledge
of
thy
wayes
he
is
a
man
that
sayes
in
his
heart
and
with
his
actions
i
have
loved
strangers
sins
and
after
them
i
will
goe
he
is
a
man
that
shuts
his
eyes
stops
his
ears
and
that
turneth
his
spirit
against
god
yea
he
is
the
man
that
is
at
enmity
with
god
and
that
abhorres
him
with
his
soul
atten
what
other
signe
can
you
give
me
that
badman
died
without
repentance
wise
why
he
did
never
heartily
cry
to
god
for
mercy
all
the
time
of
his
affliction
true
when
sinking
fits
stitches
or
pains
took
hold
upon
him
then
he
would
say
as
other
carnal
men
use
to
do
lord
help
me
lord
strengthen
me
lord
deliver
me
and
the
like
but
to
cry
to
god
for
mercy
that
he
did
not
but
lay
as
i
hinted
before
as
if
he
never
had
sinned
atten
that
is
another
bad
sign
indeed
for
crying
to
god
for
mercy
is
one
of
the
first
signs
of
repentance
when
paul
lay
repenting
of
his
sin
upon
his
bed
the
holy
ghost
said
of
him
behold
he
prayes
but
he
that
hath
not
the
first
signs
of
repentance
tis
a
sign
he
hath
none
of
the
other
and
so
indeed
none
at
all
i
do
not
say
but
there
may
be
crying
where
there
may
be
no
sign
of
repentance
they
cryed
says
david
to
the
lord
but
he
answered
them
not
but
that
he
would
have
done
if
their
cry
had
been
the
fruit
of
repentance
but
i
say
if
men
may
cry
and
yet
have
no
repentance
be
sure
they
have
none
that
cry
not
at
all
it
is
said
in
job
they
cry
not
when
he
bindeth
them
that
is
because
they
have
no
repentance
no
repentance
no
cryes
false
repentance
false
cryes
true
repentance
true
cryes
wise
i
know
that
it
is
as
possible
for
a
man
to
forbear
crying
that
hath
repentance
as
it
is
for
a
man
to
forbear
groaning
that
feeleth
deadly
pain
he
that
looketh
into
the
book
of
psalms
where
repentance
is
most
lively
set
forth
even
in
its
true
and
proper
effects
shall
there
find
that
crying
strong
crying
hearty
crying
great
crying
and
uncessant
crying
hath
been
the
fruits
of
repentance
but
none
of
this
had
this
badman
therefore
he
dyed
in
his
sins
that
crying
is
an
inseparable
effect
of
repentance
is
seen
in
these
scriptures
have
mercy
upon
me
o
god
according
to
the
multitude
of
thy
tender
mercies
blot
out
my
transgressions
o
lord
rebuke
me
not
in
thine
anger
neither
chasten
me
in
thy
hot
displeasure
have
mercy
upon
me
o
lord
for
i
am
weak
o
lord
heal
me
for
my
bones
are
vexed
my
soul
is
also
vexed
but
thou
o
lord
how
long
return
o
lord
deliver
my
soul
o
save
me
for
thy
mercies
sake
o
lord
rebuke
me
not
in
thy
wrath
neither
chasten
me
in
thy
hot
displeasure
for
thine
arrows
stick
fast
in
me
and
thy
hand
presseth
me
sore
there
is
no
soundness
in
my
flesh
because
of
thine
anger
neither
is
there
any
rest
in
my
bones
because
of
my
sin
for
mine
iniquities
are
gone
over
mine
head
as
an
heavy
burthen
they
are
too
heavy
for
me
my
wounds
stink
and
are
corrupt
because
of
my
foolishness
i
am
troubled
i
am
bowed
down
greatly
i
goe
mourning
all
the
day
long
my
loyns
are
filled
with
a
loathsom
disease
and
there
is
no
soundness
in
my
flesh
i
am
feeble
and
sore
broken
i
have
roared
by
reason
of
the
disquietness
of
my
heart
i
might
give
you
a
great
number
more
of
the
holy
sayings
of
good
men
whereby
they
express
how
they
were
what
they
felt
and
whether
they
cryed
or
no
when
repentance
was
wrought
in
them
alas
alas
it
is
as
possible
for
a
man
when
the
pangs
of
guilt
are
upon
him
to
forbear
praying
as
it
is
for
a
woman
when
pangs
of
travel
are
upon
her
to
forbear
crying
if
all
the
world
should
tell
me
that
such
a
man
hath
repentance
yet
if
he
is
not
a
praying
man
i
should
not
be
perswaded
to
believe
it
atten
i
know
no
reason
why
you
should
for
there
is
nothing
can
demonstrate
that
such
a
man
hath
it
but
pray
sir
what
other
sign
have
you
by
which
you
can
prove
that
badman
died
in
his
sins
and
so
in
a
state
of
damnation
wise
i
have
this
to
prove
it
those
who
were
his
old
sinfull
companions
in
the
time
of
his
health
were
those
whose
company
and
carnal
talk
he
most
delighted
in
in
the
time
of
his
sickness
i
did
occasionally
hint
this
before
but
now
i
make
it
an
argument
of
his
want
of
grace
for
where
there
is
indeed
a
work
of
grace
in
the
heart
that
work
doth
not
only
change
the
heart
thoughts
and
desires
but
the
conversation
also
yea
conversation
and
company
too
when
paul
had
a
work
of
grace
in
his
soul
he
assayed
to
joyn
himself
to
the
disciples
he
was
for
his
old
companions
in
their
abominations
no
longer
he
was
now
a
disciple
and
was
for
the
company
of
disciples
and
he
was
with
them
coming
in
and
going
out
in
jerusalem
atten
i
thought
something
when
i
heard
you
make
mention
of
it
before
thought
i
this
is
a
shrewd
sign
that
he
had
not
grace
in
his
heart
birds
of
a
feather
thought
i
will
flock
together
if
this
man
was
one
of
gods
children
he
would
heard
with
gods
children
his
delight
would
be
with
and
in
the
company
of
gods
children
as
david
said
i
am
a
companion
of
all
them
that
fear
thee
and
of
them
that
keep
thy
precepts
wise
you
say
well
for
what
fellowship
hath
he
that
believeth
with
an
infidel
and
although
it
be
true
that
all
that
joyn
to
the
godly
are
not
godly
yet
they
that
shall
inwardly
choose
the
company
of
the
ungodly
and
open
profane
rather
than
the
company
of
the
godly
as
badman
did
surely
are
not
godly
men
but
profane
he
was
as
i
told
you
out
of
his
element
when
good
men
did
come
to
visit
him
but
then
he
was
where
he
would
be
when
he
had
his
vain
companions
about
him
alas
grace
as
i
said
altereth
all
heart
life
company
and
all
for
by
it
the
heart
and
man
is
made
new
and
a
new
heart
a
new
man
must
have
objects
of
delight
that
are
new
and
like
himself
old
things
are
passed
away
why
for
all
things
are
become
new
now
if
all
things
are
become
new
to
wit
heart
mind
thoughts
desires
and
delights
it
followeth
by
consequence
that
the
company
must
be
answerable
hence
it
is
said
that
they
that
believed
were
together
that
they
went
to
their
own
company
that
they
were
added
to
the
church
that
they
were
of
one
heart
and
of
one
soul
and
the
like
now
if
it
be
objected
that
badman
was
sick
and
so
could
not
goe
to
the
godly
yet
he
had
a
tongue
in
his
head
and
could
had
he
had
an
heart
have
spoken
to
some
to
call
or
send
for
the
godly
to
come
to
him
yea
he
would
have
done
so
yea
the
company
of
all
others
specially
his
fellow
sinners
would
even
in
every
appearance
of
them
before
him
have
been
a
burden
and
a
grief
unto
him
his
heart
and
affection
standing
bent
to
good
good
companions
would
have
suited
him
best
but
his
companions
were
his
old
associates
his
delight
was
in
them
therefore
his
heart
and
soul
were
yet
ungodly
atten
pray
how
was
he
when
he
drew
near
his
end
for
i
perceive
that
what
you
say
of
him
now
hath
reference
to
him
and
to
his
actions
at
the
beginning
of
his
sickness
then
he
could
endure
company
and
much
talk
besides
perhaps
then
he
thought
he
should
recover
and
not
die
as
afterwards
he
had
cause
to
think
when
he
was
quite
wasted
with
pining
sickness
when
he
was
at
the
graves
mouth
but
how
was
he
i
say
when
he
was
as
we
say
at
the
graves
mouth
within
a
step
of
death
when
he
saw
and
knew
and
could
not
but
know
that
shortly
he
must
dye
and
appear
before
the
judgment
of
god
wise
why
there
was
not
any
other
alteration
in
him
than
what
was
made
by
his
disease
upon
his
body
sickness
you
know
will
alter
the
body
also
pains
and
stitches
will
make
men
groan
but
for
his
mind
he
had
no
alteration
there
his
mind
was
the
same
his
heart
was
the
same
he
was
the
badman
still
not
onely
in
name
but
conditions
and
that
to
the
very
day
of
his
death
yea
so
far
as
could
be
gathered
to
the
very
moment
in
which
he
died
atten
pray
how
was
he
in
his
death
was
death
strong
upon
him
or
did
he
dye
with
ease
quietly
wise
as
quietly
as
a
lamb
there
seemed
not
to
be
in
it
to
standers
by
so
much
as
a
strong
struggle
of
nature
and
as
for
his
mind
it
seemed
to
be
wholly
at
quiet
but
pray
why
do
you
ask
me
this
question
atten
not
for
mine
own
sake
but
for
others
for
there
is
such
an
opinion
as
this
among
the
ignorant
that
if
a
man
dies
as
they
call
it
like
a
lamb
that
is
quietly
and
without
that
consternation
of
mind
that
others
shew
in
their
death
they
conclude
and
that
beyond
all
doubt
that
such
an
one
is
gone
to
heaven
and
is
certainly
escaped
the
wrath
to
come
wise
there
is
no
judgment
to
be
made
by
a
quiet
death
of
the
eternal
state
of
him
that
so
dieth
suppose
one
man
should
die
quietly
another
should
die
suddenly
and
a
third
should
die
under
great
consternation
of
spirit
no
man
can
judge
of
their
eternall
condition
by
the
manner
of
any
of
these
kinds
of
deaths
he
that
dies
quietly
suddenly
or
under
consternation
of
spirit
may
goe
to
heaven
or
may
goe
to
hell
no
man
can
tell
whether
a
man
goes
by
any
such
manner
of
death
the
judgment
therefore
that
we
make
of
the
eternall
condition
of
a
man
must
be
gathered
from
another
consideration
to
wit
did
the
man
die
in
his
sins
did
he
die
in
unbelief
did
he
die
before
he
was
born
again
then
he
is
gone
to
the
devil
and
hell
though
he
died
never
so
quietly
again
was
the
man
a
good
man
had
he
faith
and
holiness
was
he
a
lover
and
a
worshipper
of
god
by
christ
according
to
his
word
then
he
is
gone
to
god
and
heaven
how
suddenly
or
in
what
consternation
of
mind
soever
he
died
but
badman
was
naught
his
life
was
evil
his
wayes
were
evil
evil
to
his
end
he
therefore
went
to
hell
and
to
the
devil
how
quietly
soever
he
died
indeed
there
is
in
some
cases
a
judgment
to
be
made
of
a
mans
eternal
condition
by
the
manner
of
the
death
he
dieth
as
suppose
now
a
man
should
murder
himself
or
live
a
wicked
life
and
after
that
die
in
utter
despair
these
men
without
doubt
do
both
of
them
goe
to
hell
and
here
i
will
take
an
occasion
to
speak
of
two
of
badmans
brethren
for
you
know
i
told
you
before
that
he
had
brethren
and
of
the
manner
of
their
death
one
of
them
killed
himself
and
the
other
after
a
wicked
life
died
in
utter
despair
now
i
should
not
be
afraid
to
conclude
of
both
these
that
they
went
by
and
through
their
death
to
hell
atten
pray
tell
me
concerning
the
first
how
he
made
away
himself
wise
why
he
took
a
knife
and
cut
his
own
throat
and
immediately
gave
up
the
ghost
and
died
now
what
can
we
judge
of
such
a
mans
condition
since
the
scripture
saith
no
murderer
hath
eternall
life
but
that
it
must
be
concluded
that
such
an
one
is
gone
to
hell
he
was
a
murderer
a
and
he
is
the
worst
murderer
one
that
slays
his
own
body
and
soul
nor
doe
we
find
mention
made
of
any
but
cursed
ones
that
doe
such
kind
of
deeds
i
say
no
mention
made
in
holy
writ
of
any
others
but
such
that
murder
themselves
and
this
is
the
sore
judgment
of
god
upon
men
when
god
shall
for
the
sins
of
such
give
them
up
to
be
their
own
executioners
or
rather
to
execute
his
judgment
and
anger
upon
themselves
and
let
me
earnestly
give
this
caution
to
sinners
take
heed
sirs
break
off
your
sins
lest
god
serves
you
as
he
served
badmans
brother
that
is
lest
he
gives
you
up
to
be
your
own
murderers
atten
now
you
talk
of
this
picture
take
note
symbol
i
did
once
know
a
man
a
barber
that
took
his
own
raisor
and
cut
his
own
throat
and
then
put
his
head
out
of
his
to
shew
the
neighbours
what
he
had
done
and
after
a
little
while
died
wise
picture
take
note
symbol
i
can
tell
you
a
more
dreadful
thing
than
this
i
mean
as
to
the
manner
of
doing
the
fact
there
was
about
twelve
years
since
a
man
that
lived
at
brafield
by
northampton
named
john
cox
that
murdered
himself
the
manner
of
his
doing
of
it
was
thus
he
was
a
poor
man
and
had
for
some
time
been
sick
and
the
time
of
his
sickness
was
about
the
beginning
of
and
taking
too
many
thoughts
how
he
should
live
afterwards
if
he
lost
his
present
season
of
work
he
fell
into
deep
despair
about
the
world
and
cryed
out
to
his
wife
the
morning
before
he
killed
himself
saying
we
are
undone
but
quickly
after
he
desired
his
wife
to
depart
the
room
because
said
he
i
will
see
if
i
can
get
any
rest
so
she
went
out
but
he
instead
of
sleeping
quickly
took
his
raisor
and
therewith
cut
up
a
great
hole
in
his
side
out
of
which
he
pulled
and
cut
off
some
of
his
guts
and
threw
them
with
the
blood
up
and
down
the
chamber
but
this
not
speeding
of
him
so
soon
as
he
desired
he
took
the
same
raisor
and
therewith
cut
his
own
throat
his
wife
then
hearing
of
him
sigh
and
fetch
his
wind
short
came
again
into
the
room
to
him
and
seeing
what
he
had
done
she
ran
out
and
called
in
some
neighbours
who
came
to
him
where
he
lay
in
a
bloody
manner
frightfull
to
behold
then
said
one
of
them
to
him
ah
john
what
have
you
done
are
you
not
sorry
for
what
you
have
done
he
answered
roughly
tis
too
late
to
be
sorry
then
said
the
same
person
to
him
again
ah
john
pray
to
god
to
forgive
thee
this
bloody
act
of
thine
at
the
hearing
of
which
exhortation
he
seemed
much
offended
and
in
angry
manner
said
pray
and
with
that
flung
himself
away
to
the
wall
and
so
after
a
few
gasps
died
desperately
when
he
had
turned
him
of
his
back
to
the
wall
the
blood
ran
out
of
his
belly
as
out
of
a
boul
and
soaked
quite
through
the
bed
to
the
boards
and
through
the
chinks
of
the
boards
it
ran
pouring
down
to
the
ground
some
said
that
when
the
neighbours
came
to
see
him
he
lay
groaping
with
his
hand
in
his
bowels
reaching
upward
as
was
thought
that
he
might
have
pulled
or
cut
out
his
heart
twas
said
also
that
some
of
his
liver
had
been
by
him
torn
out
and
cast
upon
the
boards
and
that
many
of
his
guts
hung
out
of
the
bed
on
the
side
thereof
but
i
can
not
confirm
all
particulars
but
the
general
of
the
story
with
these
circumstances
above
mentioned
is
true
i
had
it
from
a
sober
and
credible
person
who
himself
was
one
that
saw
him
in
this
bloody
state
and
that
talked
with
him
as
was
hinted
before
many
other
such
dreadful
things
might
be
told
you
but
these
are
enough
and
too
many
too
if
god
in
his
wisdom
had
thought
necessary
to
prevent
them
atten
this
is
a
dreadful
story
and
i
would
to
god
that
it
might
be
a
warning
to
others
to
instruct
them
to
fear
before
god
and
pray
lest
he
gives
them
up
to
doe
as
john
cox
hath
done
for
surely
can
not
goe
to
heaven
and
therefore
as
you
have
said
he
that
dieth
by
his
own
hands
is
certainly
gone
to
hell
but
speak
a
word
or
two
of
the
other
man
you
mentioned
wise
what
of
a
wicked
man
dying
in
despair
atten
yes
of
a
wicked
man
dying
in
despair
wise
well
then
this
badmans
other
brother
was
a
very
wicked
man
both
in
heart
and
life
i
say
in
heart
because
he
was
so
in
life
nor
could
anything
reclaim
him
neither
good
men
good
books
good
examples
nor
gods
judgements
well
after
he
had
lived
a
great
while
in
his
sins
god
smote
with
a
sickness
of
which
he
died
now
in
his
sickness
his
conscience
began
to
be
awakened
and
he
began
to
roar
out
of
his
life
insomuch
that
the
town
began
to
ring
of
him
now
when
it
was
noysed
about
many
of
the
neighbours
came
to
see
him
and
to
read
by
him
as
is
the
common
way
with
some
but
all
that
they
could
doe
picture
take
note
symbol
could
not
abate
his
terror
but
he
would
lie
in
his
bed
gnashing
of
his
teeth
and
wringing
of
his
wrists
concluding
upon
the
damnation
of
his
soul
and
in
that
horror
and
despair
he
dyed
not
calling
upon
god
but
distrusting
in
his
mercy
and
blaspheming
of
his
name
atten
this
brings
to
my
mind
a
man
that
a
friend
of
mine
told
me
of
picture
take
note
symbol
he
had
been
a
wicked
liver
so
when
he
came
to
die
he
fell
into
despair
and
having
concluded
that
god
had
no
mercy
for
him
he
addressed
himself
to
the
devil
for
favour
saying
good
devil
be
good
unto
me
wise
this
is
almost
like
saul
who
being
forsaken
of
god
went
to
the
witch
of
endor
and
so
to
the
devil
for
help
but
alas
should
i
set
my
self
to
collect
these
dreadful
stories
it
would
be
easie
in
little
time
to
present
you
with
hundreds
of
them
but
i
will
conclude
as
i
began
they
that
are
their
own
murderers
or
that
die
in
despair
after
they
have
lived
a
life
of
wickedness
do
surely
go
to
hell
and
here
i
would
put
in
a
caution
every
one
that
dieth
under
consternation
of
spirit
that
is
under
amazement
and
great
fear
do
not
therefore
die
in
despair
for
a
good
man
may
have
this
for
his
bands
in
his
death
and
yet
go
to
heaven
and
glory
for
as
i
said
before
he
that
is
a
good
man
a
man
that
hath
faith
and
holiness
a
lover
and
worshipper
of
god
by
christ
according
to
his
word
may
die
in
consternation
of
spirit
for
satan
will
not
be
wanting
to
assault
good
men
upon
their
but
they
are
secured
by
the
word
and
power
of
god
yea
and
are
also
helped
though
with
much
agony
of
spirit
to
exercise
themselves
in
faith
and
prayer
the
which
he
that
dieth
in
despair
can
by
no
means
doe
but
let
us
return
to
badman
and
enter
further
discourse
of
the
manner
of
his
death
atten
i
think
you
and
i
are
both
of
a
mind
for
just
now
i
was
thinking
to
call
you
back
to
him
also
and
pray
now
since
it
is
your
own
motion
to
return
again
to
him
let
us
discourse
a
little
more
of
his
quiet
and
still
death
wise
with
all
my
heart
you
know
we
were
speaking
before
of
the
manner
of
badmans
death
how
that
he
dyed
very
stilly
and
quietly
upon
which
you
made
observation
that
the
common
people
conclude
that
if
a
man
dyes
quietly
and
as
they
call
it
like
a
lamb
he
is
certainly
gone
to
heaven
when
alas
if
a
wicked
man
dyes
quietly
if
a
man
that
has
all
his
dayes
lived
in
notorious
sin
dyeth
quietly
his
quiet
dying
is
so
far
off
from
being
a
sign
of
his
being
saved
that
it
is
an
uncontrollable
proof
of
his
damnation
this
was
badmans
case
he
lived
wickedly
even
to
the
last
and
then
went
quietly
out
of
the
world
therefore
badman
is
gone
to
hell
att
well
but
since
you
are
upon
it
and
also
so
confident
in
it
to
wit
that
a
man
that
lives
a
wicked
life
till
he
dyes
and
then
dyes
quietly
is
gone
to
hell
let
me
see
hat
shew
of
proof
you
have
for
this
your
opinion
wise
my
first
argument
is
drawn
from
the
necessity
of
repentance
no
man
can
be
saved
except
he
repents
nor
can
he
repent
that
sees
not
that
knows
not
that
he
is
a
sinner
and
he
that
knows
himself
to
be
a
sinner
will
i
will
warrant
him
be
molested
for
the
time
by
that
knowledge
this
as
it
is
testified
by
all
the
scriptures
so
it
is
testified
by
christian
experience
he
that
knows
of
himself
to
be
a
sinner
is
molested
especially
if
that
knowledge
comes
not
to
him
untill
he
is
cast
upon
his
molested
i
say
before
he
can
dye
quietly
yea
he
is
molested
dejected
and
cast
down
he
is
also
made
to
cry
out
to
hunger
and
thirst
after
mercy
by
christ
and
if
at
all
he
shall
indeed
come
to
die
quietly
i
mean
with
that
quietness
that
is
begotten
by
faith
and
hope
in
gods
mercy
to
the
which
badman
and
his
brethren
were
utter
strangers
his
quietness
is
distinguished
by
all
judicious
observers
by
what
went
before
it
by
what
it
flows
from
and
also
by
what
is
the
fruit
thereof
i
must
confess
i
am
no
admirer
of
repentance
for
i
think
verily
it
is
seldom
good
for
any
thing
but
i
say
he
that
hath
lived
in
sin
and
profaneness
all
his
dayes
as
badman
did
and
yet
shall
dye
quietly
that
is
without
repentance
steps
in
twixt
his
life
and
death
he
is
assuredly
gone
to
hell
and
is
damned
atten
this
does
look
like
an
argument
indeed
for
repentance
must
come
or
else
we
must
goe
to
and
if
a
lewd
liver
shall
i
mean
that
so
continues
till
the
day
of
his
death
yet
goe
out
of
the
world
quietly
tis
a
sign
that
he
died
without
repentance
and
so
a
sign
that
he
is
damned
wise
i
am
satisfied
in
it
for
my
part
and
that
from
the
necessity
and
nature
of
repentance
it
is
necessary
because
god
calls
for
it
and
will
not
pardon
sin
without
it
except
ye
repent
ye
shall
all
likewise
perish
this
is
that
which
god
hath
said
and
he
will
prove
but
a
man
that
shall
yet
think
to
goe
to
heaven
and
glory
without
it
repent
for
the
ax
is
laid
to
the
root
of
the
tree
every
tree
therefore
that
bringeth
not
forth
good
fruit
but
no
good
fruit
can
be
where
there
is
not
sound
repentance
shall
be
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
this
was
badmans
case
he
had
attending
of
him
a
sinfull
life
and
that
to
the
very
last
and
yet
dyed
quietly
that
is
without
repentance
he
is
gone
to
hell
and
is
damned
for
the
nature
of
repentance
i
have
touched
upon
that
already
and
shewed
that
it
never
was
where
a
quiet
death
is
the
immediate
companion
of
a
sinfull
life
and
therefore
badman
is
gone
to
hell
secondly
my
second
argument
is
drawn
from
that
blessed
word
of
christ
while
the
strong
man
armed
keeps
the
house
his
goods
are
in
peace
till
a
stronger
than
he
comes
but
the
strong
man
armed
kept
badmans
house
that
is
his
heart
and
soul
and
body
for
he
went
from
a
sinfull
life
quietly
out
of
this
world
the
stronger
did
not
disturb
by
intercepting
with
sound
repentance
betwixt
his
sinful
life
and
his
quiet
death
therefore
badman
is
gone
to
hell
the
strong
man
armed
is
the
devil
and
quietness
is
his
security
the
devil
never
fears
losing
of
the
sinner
if
he
can
but
keep
him
quiet
can
he
but
keep
him
quiet
in
a
sinfull
life
and
quiet
in
his
death
he
is
his
own
therefore
he
saith
his
goods
are
in
peace
that
is
out
of
danger
there
is
no
fear
of
the
devils
losing
such
a
soul
i
say
because
christ
who
is
the
best
judge
in
this
matter
saith
his
goods
are
in
peace
in
quiet
and
out
of
danger
atten
this
is
a
good
one
too
for
doubtless
peace
and
quiet
with
sin
is
one
of
the
greatest
signs
of
a
damnable
state
wise
so
it
is
therefore
when
god
would
shew
the
greatness
of
his
anger
against
sin
and
sinners
in
one
word
he
saith
they
are
joyned
to
idols
let
them
alone
let
them
alone
that
is
disturb
them
not
let
them
goe
on
without
controll
let
the
devil
enjoy
them
peaceably
let
him
carry
them
out
of
the
world
unconverted
quietly
this
is
one
of
the
sorest
of
judgments
and
bespeaketh
the
burning
anger
of
god
against
sinfull
men
see
also
when
you
come
home
the
fourteenth
verse
of
the
chapter
last
mentioned
in
the
margent
i
will
not
punish
your
daughters
when
they
commit
whoredom
i
will
let
them
alone
they
shall
live
and
dye
in
their
sins
but
thirdly
my
third
argument
is
drawn
from
that
saying
of
christ
he
hath
blinded
their
eyes
and
hardened
their
hearts
that
they
should
not
see
with
their
eyes
nor
understand
with
their
hearts
and
be
converted
and
i
should
heal
them
there
are
three
things
that
i
will
take
notice
of
from
these
words
the
first
is
that
there
can
be
no
conversion
to
god
where
the
eye
is
darkned
and
the
heart
hardened
the
eye
must
first
be
made
to
see
and
the
heart
to
break
and
relent
under
and
for
sin
or
else
there
can
be
no
conversion
he
hath
blinded
their
eyes
and
hardned
their
hearts
lest
they
should
see
and
understand
and
so
be
converted
and
this
was
clearly
badmans
case
he
lived
a
wicked
life
and
also
died
with
his
eyes
shut
and
heart
hardened
as
is
manifest
in
that
a
sinful
life
was
joyned
with
a
quiet
death
and
all
for
that
he
should
not
be
converted
but
partake
of
the
fruit
of
his
sinfull
life
in
hell
fire
the
second
thing
that
i
take
notice
of
from
these
words
is
that
this
is
a
dispensation
and
manifestation
of
gods
anger
against
a
man
for
his
sin
when
god
is
angry
with
men
i
mean
when
he
is
so
angry
with
them
this
among
many
is
one
of
the
judgments
that
he
giveth
them
up
unto
to
wit
to
blindness
of
mind
and
hardness
of
heart
which
he
also
suffereth
to
accompany
them
till
they
enter
in
at
the
gates
of
death
and
then
and
there
and
not
short
of
then
and
there
their
eyes
come
to
be
opened
hence
it
is
said
of
the
rich
man
mentioned
in
luke
he
dyed
and
in
hell
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
implying
that
he
did
not
lift
them
up
before
he
neither
saw
what
he
had
done
nor
whither
he
was
going
till
he
came
to
the
place
of
execution
even
into
hell
he
died
asleep
in
his
soul
he
dyed
bespotted
stupified
and
so
consequently
for
quietness
like
a
child
or
lamb
even
as
badman
did
this
was
a
sign
of
gods
anger
he
had
a
mind
to
damn
him
for
his
sins
and
therefore
would
not
let
him
see
nor
have
an
heart
to
repent
for
them
lest
he
should
convert
and
his
damnation
which
god
had
appointed
should
be
frustrate
lest
they
should
be
converted
and
i
should
heal
them
the
third
thing
that
i
take
notice
of
from
hence
is
that
a
sinfull
life
and
a
quiet
death
annexed
to
it
is
the
ready
the
open
the
beaten
the
common
to
hell
there
is
no
surer
sign
of
damnation
than
for
a
man
to
dye
quietly
after
a
sinfull
life
i
do
not
say
that
all
wicked
men
that
are
molested
at
their
death
with
a
sence
of
sin
and
fears
of
hell
do
therefore
goe
to
heaven
for
some
are
also
made
to
see
and
are
left
to
despair
not
converted
by
seeing
that
they
might
go
roaring
out
of
this
world
to
their
place
but
i
say
there
is
no
surer
sign
of
a
mans
damnation
than
to
dye
quietly
after
a
sinful
life
than
to
sin
and
dye
with
his
eyes
shut
than
to
sin
and
dye
with
an
heart
that
can
not
repent
he
hath
blinded
their
eyes
and
hardened
their
heart
that
they
should
not
see
with
their
eyes
nor
understand
with
their
heart
no
not
so
long
as
they
are
in
this
world
lest
they
should
see
with
their
eyes
and
understand
with
their
heart
and
should
be
converted
and
i
should
heal
them
god
has
a
judgment
for
wicked
men
god
will
be
even
with
wicked
men
god
knows
how
to
reserve
the
ungodly
to
the
day
of
judgment
to
be
punished
and
this
is
one
of
his
wayes
by
which
he
doth
it
thus
it
was
with
badman
fourthly
it
is
said
in
the
book
of
psalms
concerning
the
wicked
there
is
no
bands
in
their
death
but
their
strength
is
firm
by
no
bands
he
means
no
troubles
no
gracious
chastisements
no
such
corrections
for
sin
as
fall
to
be
the
lot
of
gods
people
for
theirs
yea
that
many
times
falls
to
be
theirs
at
the
time
of
their
death
therefore
he
adds
concerning
the
wicked
they
are
not
troubled
then
like
other
men
neither
are
they
plagued
like
other
men
but
go
as
securely
out
of
the
world
as
if
they
had
never
sinned
against
god
and
put
their
own
souls
into
danger
of
damnation
there
is
no
band
in
their
death
they
seem
to
go
unbound
and
set
at
liberty
out
of
this
world
though
they
have
lived
notoriously
wicked
all
their
dayes
in
it
the
prisoner
that
is
to
dye
at
the
gallows
for
his
wickedness
must
first
have
his
irons
knock
t
off
his
legs
so
he
seems
to
goe
most
at
liberty
when
indeed
he
is
going
to
be
executed
for
his
transgressions
wicked
men
also
have
no
bands
in
their
death
they
seem
to
be
more
at
liberty
when
they
are
even
at
the
of
their
sinfull
life
than
at
any
time
besides
hence
you
shall
have
them
boast
of
their
faith
and
hope
in
gods
mercy
when
they
lye
upon
their
yea
you
shall
have
them
speak
as
confidently
of
their
salvation
as
if
they
had
served
god
all
their
dayes
when
the
truth
is
the
bottom
of
this
their
boasting
is
because
they
have
no
bands
in
their
death
their
sin
and
base
life
comes
not
into
their
mind
to
correct
them
and
bring
them
to
repentance
but
presumptuous
thoughts
and
an
hope
and
faith
of
the
spiders
the
devils
making
possesseth
their
soul
to
their
own
eternal
undoing
hence
wicked
mens
hope
is
said
to
dye
not
before
but
with
them
they
give
up
the
ghost
together
and
thus
did
badman
his
sins
and
his
hope
went
with
him
to
the
gate
but
there
his
hope
left
him
because
it
dyed
there
but
his
sins
went
in
with
him
to
be
a
worm
to
gnaw
him
in
his
conscience
for
ever
and
ever
the
opinion
therefore
of
the
common
people
concerning
this
kind
of
dying
is
frivolous
and
vain
for
badman
died
like
a
lamb
or
as
they
call
it
like
a
chrisom
child
quietly
and
without
fear
i
speak
not
this
with
reference
to
the
strugling
of
nature
with
death
but
as
to
the
strugling
of
the
conscience
with
the
judgment
of
god
i
know
that
nature
will
struggle
with
death
i
have
seen
a
dog
and
sheep
dye
hardly
and
thus
may
a
wicked
man
doe
because
there
is
an
antipathy
betwixt
nature
and
death
but
even
while
even
then
when
death
and
nature
are
strugling
for
mastery
the
soul
the
conscience
may
be
as
besotted
as
benummed
as
senceless
and
ignorant
of
its
miserable
state
as
the
block
or
bed
on
which
the
sick
lyes
and
thus
they
may
dye
like
a
chrisom
child
in
shew
but
indeed
like
one
who
by
the
judgment
of
god
is
bound
over
to
eternal
damnation
and
that
also
by
the
same
judgment
is
kept
from
seeing
what
they
are
and
whither
they
are
going
till
they
plunge
down
among
the
flames
and
as
it
is
a
very
great
judgment
of
god
on
wicked
men
that
so
dye
for
it
cuts
them
off
from
all
possibility
of
repentance
and
so
of
salvation
so
it
is
as
great
a
judgment
upon
those
that
are
their
companions
that
survive
them
for
by
the
manner
of
their
death
they
dying
so
quietly
so
like
unto
chrisom
children
as
they
call
it
they
are
hardened
and
take
courage
to
go
on
in
their
course
for
comparing
their
life
with
their
death
their
sinful
cursed
lives
with
their
death
they
think
that
all
is
well
that
no
damnation
is
happened
to
them
though
they
lived
like
devils
incarnate
yet
they
dyed
like
harmless
ones
there
was
no
no
tempest
no
band
nor
plague
in
their
death
they
dyed
as
quietly
as
the
most
godly
of
them
all
and
had
as
great
faith
and
hope
of
salvation
and
would
talk
as
boldly
of
salvation
as
if
they
had
assurance
of
it
but
as
was
their
hope
in
life
so
was
their
death
their
hope
was
without
tryal
because
it
was
none
of
gods
working
and
their
death
was
without
molestation
because
so
was
the
judgment
of
god
concerning
them
but
i
say
at
this
their
survivors
take
heart
to
tread
their
steps
and
to
continue
to
live
in
the
breach
of
the
law
of
god
yea
they
carry
it
statelily
in
their
villanies
for
so
it
follows
in
the
psalm
there
is
no
bands
in
their
death
but
their
strength
is
firm
therefore
pride
compasseth
them
the
survivors
about
as
a
chain
violence
covereth
them
as
a
garment
therefore
they
take
courage
to
do
evil
therefore
they
pride
themselves
in
their
iniquity
therefore
wherefore
why
because
their
fellows
died
after
they
had
lived
long
in
a
most
profane
and
wicked
life
as
quietly
and
as
like
to
lambs
as
if
they
had
been
innocent
yea
they
are
bold
by
seeing
this
to
conclude
that
god
either
does
not
or
will
not
take
notice
of
their
sins
they
speak
wickedly
they
speak
loftily
they
speak
wickedly
of
sin
for
that
they
make
it
better
than
by
the
word
it
is
pronounced
to
be
they
speak
wickedly
concerning
oppression
that
they
commend
and
count
it
a
prudent
act
they
also
speak
loftily
they
set
their
mouth
against
the
heavens
and
they
say
how
doth
god
know
and
is
there
knowledge
in
the
most
high
and
all
this
so
far
as
i
can
see
ariseth
in
their
hearts
from
the
beholding
of
the
quiet
and
death
of
their
companions
behold
these
are
the
ungodly
that
prosper
in
the
world
that
is
by
wicked
ways
they
increase
in
riches
this
therefore
is
a
great
judgment
of
god
both
upon
that
man
that
dyeth
in
his
sins
and
also
upon
his
companion
that
beholdeth
him
so
to
dye
he
sinneth
he
dyeth
in
his
sins
and
yet
dyeth
quietly
what
shall
his
companion
say
to
this
what
judgment
shall
he
make
how
god
will
deal
with
him
by
beholding
the
death
of
his
companion
be
sure
he
can
not
as
from
such
a
sight
say
wo
be
to
me
for
judgment
is
before
him
he
can
not
gather
that
sin
is
a
dreadful
and
a
bitter
thing
by
the
death
of
badman
but
must
rather
if
he
judgeth
according
to
what
he
sees
or
according
to
his
corrupted
reason
conclude
with
the
wicked
ones
of
old
that
every
one
that
doth
evil
is
good
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
he
delighteth
in
them
or
where
is
the
god
of
judgment
yea
this
is
enough
to
puzzle
the
wisest
man
david
himself
was
put
to
a
stand
by
beholding
the
quiet
death
of
ungodly
men
verily
sayes
he
i
have
cleansed
my
heart
in
vain
and
have
washed
my
hands
in
innocency
psal
they
to
appearance
fare
better
by
far
than
i
their
eyes
stand
out
with
fatness
they
have
more
than
heart
can
wish
but
all
the
day
long
have
i
been
plagued
and
chastned
every
morning
this
i
say
made
david
wonder
yea
and
job
and
jeremiah
too
but
he
goeth
into
the
sanctuary
and
then
he
understands
their
end
nor
could
he
understand
it
before
i
went
into
the
sanctuary
of
god
what
place
was
that
why
there
where
he
might
enquire
of
god
and
by
him
be
resolved
of
this
matter
then
says
he
understood
i
their
end
then
i
saw
that
thou
hast
set
them
in
slippery
places
and
that
thou
castest
them
down
to
destruction
castest
them
down
that
is
suddenly
or
as
the
next
words
say
as
in
a
moment
they
are
utterly
consumed
with
terrors
which
terrors
did
not
cease
them
on
their
for
they
had
no
bands
in
their
death
the
terrors
therefore
ceased
them
there
where
also
they
are
holden
in
them
for
ever
this
he
found
out
i
say
but
not
without
great
painfulness
grief
and
pricking
in
his
reins
so
deep
so
hard
and
so
difficult
did
he
find
it
rightly
to
come
to
a
determination
in
this
matter
and
indeed
this
is
a
deep
judgment
of
god
towards
ungodly
sinners
it
is
enough
to
stagger
a
whole
world
only
the
godly
that
are
in
the
world
have
a
sanctuary
to
go
to
where
the
oracle
and
word
of
god
is
by
which
his
judgements
and
a
reason
of
many
of
them
are
made
known
to
and
understood
by
them
atten
indeed
this
is
a
staggering
dispensation
it
is
full
of
the
wisdom
and
anger
of
god
and
i
believe
as
you
have
said
that
it
is
full
of
judgment
to
the
world
who
would
have
imagined
that
had
not
known
badman
and
yet
had
seen
him
die
but
that
he
had
been
a
man
of
an
holy
life
and
conversation
since
he
died
so
stilly
so
quietly
so
like
a
lamb
or
chrisom
child
would
they
not
i
say
have
concluded
that
he
was
a
righteous
man
or
that
if
they
had
known
him
and
his
life
yet
to
see
him
die
so
quietly
would
they
not
have
concluded
that
he
had
made
his
peace
with
god
nay
further
if
some
had
known
that
he
had
died
in
his
sins
and
yet
that
he
died
so
like
a
lamb
would
they
not
have
concluded
that
either
god
doth
not
know
our
sins
or
that
he
likes
them
or
that
he
wants
power
or
will
or
heart
or
skill
to
punish
them
since
badman
himself
went
from
a
sinfull
life
so
quietly
so
peaceably
and
so
like
a
lamb
as
he
did
wise
without
controversie
this
is
an
heavy
judgment
of
god
upon
wicked
men
job
one
goes
to
hell
in
peace
another
goes
to
hell
in
trouble
one
goes
to
hell
being
sent
thither
by
his
own
hands
another
goes
to
hell
being
sent
thither
by
the
hand
of
his
companion
one
goes
thither
with
his
eyes
shut
and
another
goes
thither
with
his
eyes
open
one
goes
thither
roaring
and
another
goes
thither
boasting
of
heaven
and
happiness
all
the
way
he
goes
one
goes
thither
like
badman
himself
and
others
go
thither
as
did
his
brethren
but
above
all
badmans
death
as
to
the
manner
of
dying
is
the
fullest
of
snares
and
traps
to
wicked
men
therefore
they
that
die
as
he
are
the
greatest
stumble
to
the
world
they
goe
and
goe
they
go
on
peaceably
from
youth
to
old
age
and
thence
to
the
grave
and
so
to
hell
without
noyse
they
goe
as
an
ox
to
the
slaughter
and
as
a
fool
to
the
correction
of
the
stocks
that
is
both
sencelesly
and
securely
o
but
being
come
at
the
gates
of
hell
o
but
when
they
see
those
gates
set
open
for
them
o
but
when
they
see
that
that
is
their
home
and
that
they
must
go
in
thither
then
their
peace
and
quietness
flies
away
for
ever
then
they
roar
like
lions
yell
like
dragons
howl
like
dogs
and
tremble
at
their
judgment
as
do
the
devils
themselves
oh
when
they
see
they
must
shoot
the
gulf
and
throat
of
hell
when
they
shall
see
that
hell
hath
shut
her
ghastly
jaws
upon
them
when
they
shall
open
their
eyes
and
find
themselves
within
the
belly
and
bowels
of
hell
then
they
will
mourn
and
weep
and
hack
and
gnash
their
teeth
for
pain
but
this
must
not
be
or
if
it
must
yet
very
rarely
till
they
are
gone
out
of
the
sight
and
hearing
of
those
mortals
whom
they
do
leave
behind
them
alive
in
the
world
atten
well
my
good
neighbour
wiseman
i
perceive
that
the
sun
grows
low
and
that
you
have
come
to
a
conclusion

i
will
take
my
leave
of
you

first
let
me
tell
you
i
am
glad
that

thank
you
for
your
freedom
with
me
in

of
me
your
reply
to

my
questions
i
would
only
beg
your
prayers
that
god
will
give
me
much
grace
that
i
may
neither
live
nor
die
as
did
badman
wise
my
good
neighbour
attentive
i
wish
your
welfare
in
soul
and
body
and
if
ought
that
i
have
said
of
badmans
life
may
be
of
benefit
unto
you
i
shall
be
heartily
glad
only
i
desire
you
to
thank
god
for
it
and
to
pray
heartily
for
me
that
i
with
you
may
be
kept
by
the
power
of
god
through
faith
unto
salvation
atten
amen
farewell
wise
i
wish
you
heartily
farewell
margin

much
