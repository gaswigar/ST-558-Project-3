note
the
stories
in
this
book
are
those
that
russian
peasants
tell
their
children
and
each
other
in
russia
hardly
anybody
is
too
old
for
fairy
stories
and
i
have
even
heard
soldiers
on
their
way
to
the
war
talking
of
very
wise
and
very
beautiful
princesses
as
they
drank
their
tea
by
the
side
of
the
road
i
think
there
must
be
more
fairy
stories
told
in
russia
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
in
this
book
are
a
few
of
those
i
like
best
i
have
taken
my
own
way
with
them
more
or
less
writing
them
mostly
from
memory
they
or
versions
like
them
are
to
be
found
in
the
coloured
in
afanasiev
great
collection
or
in
solemn
serious
volumes
of
folklorists
writing
for
the
learned
my
book
is
not
for
the
learned
or
indeed
for
people
at
all
no
people
who
really
like
fairy
stories
ever
grow
up
altogether
this
is
a
book
written
far
away
in
russia
for
english
children
who
play
in
deep
lanes
with
wild
roses
above
them
in
the
high
hedges
or
by
the
small
singing
becks
that
dance
down
the
gray
fells
at
home
russian
fairyland
is
quite

russian
tales
the
hut
in
the
forest
outside
in
the
forest
there
was
deep
snow
the
white
snow
had
crusted
the
branches
of
the
pine
trees
and
piled
itself
up
them
till
they
bent
under
its
weight
now
and
then
a
branch
would
bend
too
far
and
huge
lumps
of
snow
fell
crashing
to
the
ground
under
the
trees
then
the
branch
would
swing
up
and
the
snow
covered
it
again
with
a
cold
white
burden
sitting
in
the
hut
you
could
hear
the
crashing
again
and
again
out
in
the
forest
as
the
tired
branches
flung
down
their
loads
of
snow
yes
and
now
and
then
there
was
the
howling
of
wolves
far
away
little
maroosia
heard
them
and
thought
of
them
out
there
in
the
dark
as
they
galloped
over
the
snow
she
sat
closer
to
vanya
her
brother
and
they
were
both
as
near
as
they
could
get
to
the
door
of
the
stove
where
they
could
see
the
red
fire
burning
busily
keeping
the
whole
hut
warm
the
stove
filled
a
quarter
of
the
hut
but
that
was
because
it
was
a
bed
as
well
there
were
blankets
on
it
and
in
those
blankets
vanya
and
maroosia
rolled
up
and
went
to
sleep
at
night
as
warm
as
little
baking
cakes
the
hut
was
made
of
pine
logs
cut
from
the
forest
you
could
see
the
marks
of
the
axe
old
peter
was
the
grandfather
of
maroosia
and
vanya
he
lived
alone
with
them
in
the
hut
in
the
forest
because
their
father
and
mother
were
both
dead
maroosia
and
vanya
could
hardly
remember
them
and
they
were
very
happy
with
old
peter
who
was
very
kind
to
them
and
did
all
he
could
to
keep
them
warm
and
well
fed
he
let
them
help
him
in
everything
even
in
stuffing
the
windows
with
moss
to
keep
the
cold
out
when
winter
began
the
moss
kept
the
light
out
too
but
that
did
not
matter
it
would
be
all
the
jollier
in
the
spring
when
the
sun
came
pouring
in
besides
old
peter
and
maroosia
and
vanya
there
were
vladimir
and
bayan
vladimir
was
a
cat
a
big
black
cat
as
stately
as
an
emperor
and
just
now
he
was
lying
in
vanya
arms
fast
asleep
bayan
was
a
dog
a
tall
gray
he
could
jump
over
the
table
with
a
single
bound
when
he
was
in
the
hut
he
usually
lay
underneath
the
table
because
that
was
the
only
place
where
he
could
lie
without
being
in
the
way
and
of
course
at
meal
times
he
was
in
the
way
even
there
just
now
he
was
out
with
old
peter
i
wonder
what
story
it
will
be
said
maroosia
so
do
i
said
vanya
i
wish
they
be
quick
and
come
back
vladimir
stirred
suddenly
in
vanya
lap
and
a
minute
later
they
heard
the
scrunch
of
boots
in
the
snow
and
the
stamping
of
old
peter
feet
trying
to
get
the
snow
off
his
boots
then
the
door
opened
and
bayan
pushed
his
way
in
and
shook
himself
and
licked
maroosia
and
vanya
and
startled
vladimir
and
lay
down
under
the
table
and
came
out
again
because
he
was
so
pleased
to
be
home
and
old
peter
came
in
after
him
with
his
gun
on
his
back
and
a
hare
in
his
hand
he
shook
himself
just
like
bayan
and
the
snow
flew
off
like
spray
he
hung
up
his
gun
flung
the
hare
into
a
corner
of
the
hut
and
laughed
you
are
snug
in
here
little
pigeons
he
said
vanya
and
maroosia
had
jumped
up
to
welcome
him
and
when
he
opened
his
big
sheepskin
coat
they
tumbled
into
it
together
and
clung
to
his
belt
then
he
closed
the
big
woolly
coat
over
the
top
of
them
and
they
squealed
and
he
opened
it
a
little
way
and
looked
down
at
them
over
his
beard
and
then
closed
it
again
for
a
moment
before
letting
them
out
he
did
this
every
night
and
bayan
always
barked
when
they
were
shut
up
inside
then
old
peter
took
his
big
coat
off
and
lifted
down
the
samovar
from
the
shelf
the
samovar
is
like
a
big
with
a
fire
in
the
middle
of
it
keeping
the
water
boiling
it
hums
like
a
bee
on
the
and
the
steam
rises
in
a
little
jet
from
a
tiny
hole
in
the
top
the
boiling
water
comes
out
of
a
tap
at
the
bottom
old
peter
threw
in
the
lighted
sticks
and
charcoal
and
made
a
draught
to
draw
the
heat
and
then
set
the
samovar
on
the
table
with
the
little
fire
crackling
in
its
inside
then
he
cut
some
big
lumps
of
black
bread
then
he
took
a
great
saucepan
full
of
soup
that
was
simmering
on
the
stove
and
emptied
it
into
a
big
wooden
bowl
then
he
went
to
the
wall
where
on
three
nails
hung
three
wooden
spoons
deep
like
ladles
there
were
one
big
spoon
for
old
peter
and
two
little
spoons
one
for
vanya
and
one
for
maroosia
and
all
the
time
that
old
peter
was
getting
supper
ready
he
was
answering
questions
and
making
jokes
old
ones
of
course
that
he
made
every
day
about
how
plump
the
children
were
and
how
fat
was
better
to
eat
than
butter
and
what
the
man
in
the
moon
said
when
he
fell
out
and
what
the
wolf
said
who
caught
his
own
tail
and
ate
himself
up
before
he
found
out
his
mistake
and
vanya
and
maroosia
danced
about
the
hut
and
chuckled
then
they
had
supper
all
three
dipping
their
wooden
spoons
in
the
big
bowl
together
and
eating
a
tremendous
lot
of
black
bread
and
of
course
there
were
scraps
for
vladimir
and
a
bone
for
bayan
after
that
they
had
tea
with
sugar
but
no
milk
because
they
were
russians
and
liked
it
that
way
then
came
the
stories
old
peter
made
another
glass
of
tea
for
himself
not
for
the
children
his
throat
was
old
he
said
and
took
a
lot
of
keeping
wet
and
they
were
young
and
would
not
sleep
if
they
drank
tea
too
near
bedtime
then
he
threw
a
log
of
wood
into
the
stove
then
he
lit
a
short
little
pipe
full
of
very
strong
tobacco
called
mahorka
which
has
a
smell
like
hot
tin
and
he
puffed
and
the
smoke
got
in
his
eyes
and
he
wiped
them
with
the
back
of
his
big
hand
all
the
time
he
was
doing
this
vanya
and
maroosia
were
snuggling
together
close
by
the
stove
thinking
what
story
they
would
ask
for
and
listening
to
the
crashing
of
the
snow
as
it
fell
from
the
trees
outside
now
that
old
peter
was
at
home
the
noise
made
them
feel
comfortable
and
warm
before
perhaps
it
made
them
feel
a
little
frightened
well
little
pigeons
little
hawks
little
bear
cubs
what
is
it
to
be
said
old
peter
we
do
know
said
maroosia
long
hair
short
sense
little
said
old
peter
all
this
time
and
not
thought
of
a
story
would
you
like
the
tale
of
the
little
snow
girl
who
was
not
loved
so
much
as
a
hen
not
grandfather
said
vanya
we
like
that
tale
when
the
snow
melts
said
maroosia
we
like
a
story
we
never
heard
before
said
vanya
well
well
said
old
peter
combing
his
great
gray
beard
with
his
fingers
and
looking
out
at
them
with
twinkling
eyes
from
under
his
big
bushy
eyebrows
have
i
ever
told
you
the
story
of
silver
saucer
and
the
transparent
apple
no
no
never
cried
vanya
and
maroosia
at
once
old
peter
took
a
last
pull
at
his
pipe
and
vanya
and
maroosia
wriggled
with
excitement
then
he
drank
a
sip
of
tea
then
he
began
the
tale
of
the
silver
saucer
and
the
transparent
apple
there
was
once
an
old
peasant
and
he
must
have
had
more
brains
under
his
hair
than
ever
i
had
for
he
was
a
merchant
and
used
to
take
things
every
year
to
sell
at
the
big
fair
of
nijni
novgorod
well
i
could
never
do
that
i
could
never
be
anything
better
than
an
old
forester
never
mind
grandfather
said
maroosia
god
knows
best
and
he
makes
some
merchants
and
some
foresters
and
some
good
and
some
bad
all
in
his
own
way
anyhow
this
one
was
a
merchant
and
he
had
three
daughters
they
were
none
of
them
so
bad
to
look
at
but
one
of
them
was
as
pretty
as
maroosia
and
she
was
the
best
of
them
too
the
others
put
all
the
hard
work
on
her
while
they
did
nothing
but
look
at
themselves
in
the
and
complain
of
what
they
had
to
eat
they
called
the
pretty
one
little
stupid
because
she
was
so
good
and
did
all
their
work
for
them
oh
they
were
real
bad
ones
those
two
we
would
have
them
in
here
for
a
minute
well
the
time
came
round
for
the
merchant
to
pack
up
and
go
to
the
big
fair
he
called
his
daughters
and
said
little
pigeons
just
as
i
say
to
you
little
pigeons
says
he
what
would
you
like
me
to
bring
you
from
the
fair
says
the
eldest
i
like
a
necklace
but
it
must
be
a
rich
one
says
the
second
i
want
a
new
dress
with
gold
hems
but
the
youngest
the
good
one
little
stupid
said
nothing
at
all
now
little
one
says
her
father
what
is
it
you
want
i
must
bring
something
for
you
too
says
the
little
one
could
i
have
a
silver
saucer
and
a
transparent
apple
but
never
mind
if
there
are
none
the
old
merchant
says
long
hair
short
sense
just
as
i
say
to
maroosia
but
he
promised
the
little
pretty
one
who
was
so
good
that
her
sisters
called
her
stupid
that
if
he
could
get
her
a
silver
saucer
and
a
transparent
apple
she
should
have
them
then
they
all
kissed
each
other
and
he
cracked
his
whip
and
off
he
went
with
the
little
bells
jingling
on
the
horses
harness
the
three
sisters
waited
till
he
came
back
the
two
elder
ones
looked
in
the
and
thought
how
fine
they
would
look
in
the
new
necklace
and
the
new
dress
but
the
little
pretty
one
took
care
of
her
old
mother
and
scrubbed
and
dusted
and
swept
and
cooked
and
every
day
the
other
two
said
that
the
soup
was
burnt
or
the
bread
not
properly
baked
then
one
day
there
were
a
jingling
of
bells
and
a
clattering
of
horses
hoofs
and
the
old
merchant
came
driving
back
from
the
fair
the
sisters
ran
out
where
is
the
necklace
asked
the
first
you
have
forgotten
the
dress
asked
the
second
but
the
little
one
little
stupid
helped
her
old
father
off
with
his
coat
and
asked
him
if
he
was
tired
well
little
one
says
the
old
merchant
and
do
you
want
your
fairing
too
i
went
from
one
end
of
the
market
to
the
other
before
i
could
get
what
you
wanted
i
bought
the
silver
saucer
from
an
old
jew
and
the
transparent
apple
from
a
finnish
hag
oh
thank
you
father
says
the
little
one
and
what
will
you
do
with
them
says
he
i
shall
spin
the
apple
in
the
saucer
says
the
little
pretty
one
and
at
that
the
old
merchant
burst
out
laughing
they
do
call
you
stupid
for
nothing
says
he
well
they
all
had
their
fairings
and
the
two
elder
sisters
the
bad
ones
they
ran
off
and
put
on
the
new
dress
and
the
new
necklace
and
came
out
and
strutted
about
preening
themselves
like
herons
now
on
one
leg
and
now
on
the
other
to
see
how
they
looked
but
little
stupid
she
just
sat
herself
down
beside
the
stove
and
took
the
transparent
apple
and
set
it
in
the
silver
saucer
and
she
laughed
softly
to
herself
and
then
she
began
spinning
the
apple
in
the
saucer
round
and
round
the
apple
spun
in
the
saucer
faster
and
faster
till
you
could
see
the
apple
at
all
nothing
but
a
mist
like
a
little
whirlpool
in
the
silver
saucer
and
the
little
good
one
looked
at
it
and
her
eyes
shone
like
yours
her
sisters
laughed
at
her
spinning
an
apple
in
a
saucer
and
staring
at
it
the
little
stupid
they
said
as
they
strutted
about
the
room
listening
to
the
rustle
of
the
new
dress
and
fingering
the
bright
round
stones
of
the
necklace
but
the
little
pretty
one
did
not
mind
them
she
sat
in
the
corner
watching
the
spinning
apple
and
as
it
spun
she
talked
to
it
spin
spin
apple
in
the
silver
saucer
this
is
what
she
said
spin
so
that
i
may
see
the
world
let
me
have
a
peep
at
the
little
father
tzar
on
his
high
throne
let
me
see
the
rivers
and
the
ships
and
the
great
towns
far
away
and
as
she
looked
at
the
little
glass
whirlpool
in
the
saucer
there
was
the
tzar
the
little
father
god
preserve
him
sitting
on
his
high
throne
ships
sailed
on
the
seas
their
white
sails
swelling
in
the
wind
there
was
moscow
with
its
white
stone
walls
and
painted
churches
why
there
were
the
market
at
nijni
novgorod
and
the
arab
merchants
with
their
camels
and
the
chinese
with
their
blue
trousers
and
bamboo
staves
and
then
there
was
the
great
river
volga
with
men
on
the
banks
towing
ships
against
the
stream
yes
and
she
saw
a
sturgeon
asleep
in
a
deep
pool
oh
oh
oh
says
the
little
pretty
one
as
she
saw
all
these
things
and
the
bad
ones
they
saw
how
her
eyes
shone
and
they
came
and
looked
over
her
shoulder
and
saw
how
all
the
world
was
there
in
the
spinning
apple
and
the
silver
saucer
and
the
old
father
came
and
looked
over
her
shoulder
too
and
he
saw
the
market
at
nijni
novgorod
why
there
is
the
inn
where
i
put
up
the
horses
says
he
you
have
done
so
badly
after
all
little
stupid
and
the
little
pretty
one
little
stupid
went
on
staring
into
the
glass
whirlpool
in
the
saucer
spinning
the
apple
and
seeing
all
the
world
she
had
never
seen
before
floating
there
before
her
in
the
saucer
brighter
than
leaves
in
sunlight
the
bad
ones
the
elder
sisters
were
sick
with
envy
little
stupid
says
the
first
if
you
will
give
me
your
silver
saucer
and
your
transparent
apple
i
will
give
you
my
fine
new
necklace
little
stupid
says
the
second
i
will
give
you
my
new
dress
with
gold
hems
if
you
will
give
me
your
transparent
apple
and
your
silver
saucer
oh
i
could
do
that
says
the
little
stupid
and
she
goes
on
spinning
the
apple
in
the
saucer
and
seeing
what
was
happening
all
over
the
world
so
the
bad
ones
put
their
wicked
heads
together
and
thought
of
a
plan
and
they
took
their
father
axe
and
went
into
the
deep
forest
and
hid
it
under
a
bush
the
next
day
they
waited
till
afternoon
when
work
was
done
and
the
little
pretty
one
was
spinning
her
apple
in
the
saucer
then
they
said
come
along
little
stupid
we
are
all
going
to
gather
berries
in
the
forest
do
you
really
want
me
to
come
too
says
the
little
one
she
would
rather
have
played
with
her
apple
and
saucer
but
they
said
why
of
course
you
do
think
we
can
carry
all
the
berries
ourselves
so
the
little
one
jumped
up
and
found
the
baskets
and
went
with
them
to
the
forest
but
before
she
started
she
ran
to
her
father
who
was
counting
his
money
and
was
not
too
pleased
to
be
interrupted
for
figures
go
quickly
out
of
your
head
when
you
have
a
lot
of
them
to
remember
she
asked
him
to
take
care
of
the
silver
saucer
and
the
transparent
apple
for
fear
she
would
lose
them
in
the
forest
very
well
little
bird
says
the
old
man
and
he
put
the
things
in
a
box
with
a
lock
and
key
to
it
he
was
a
merchant
you
know
and
that
sort
are
always
careful
about
things
and
go
clattering
about
with
a
lot
of
keys
at
their
belt
i
nothing
to
lock
up
and
never
had
and
perhaps
it
is
just
as
well
for
i
could
never
be
bothered
with
keys
so
the
little
one
picks
up
all
three
baskets
and
runs
off
after
the
others
the
bad
ones
with
black
hearts
under
their
necklaces
and
new
dresses
they
went
deep
into
the
forest
picking
berries
and
the
little
one
picked
so
fast
that
she
soon
had
a
basket
full
she
was
picking
and
picking
and
did
not
see
what
the
bad
ones
were
doing
they
were
fetching
the
axe
the
little
one
stood
up
to
straighten
her
back
which
ached
after
so
much
stooping
and
she
saw
her
two
sisters
standing
in
front
of
her
looking
at
her
cruelly
their
baskets
lay
on
the
ground
quite
empty
they
had
not
picked
a
berry
the
eldest
had
the
axe
in
her
hand
the
little
one
was
frightened
what
is
it
sisters
says
she
and
why
do
you
look
at
me
with
cruel
eyes
and
what
is
the
axe
for
you
are
not
going
to
cut
berries
with
an
axe
no
little
stupid
says
the
first
we
are
not
going
to
cut
berries
with
the
axe
no
little
stupid
says
the
second
the
axe
is
here
for
something
else
the
little
one
begged
them
not
to
frighten
her
says
the
first
give
me
your
transparent
apple
says
the
second
give
me
your
silver
saucer
if
you
do
give
them
up
at
once
we
shall
kill
you
that
is
what
the
bad
ones
said
the
poor
little
one
begged
them
o
darling
sisters
do
not
kill
me
i
have
got
the
saucer
or
the
apple
with
me
at
all
what
a
lie
say
the
bad
ones
you
never
would
leave
it
behind
and
one
caught
her
by
the
hair
and
the
other
swung
the
axe
and
between
them
they
killed
the
little
pretty
one
who
was
called
little
stupid
because
she
was
so
good
then
they
looked
for
the
saucer
and
the
apple
and
could
not
find
them
but
it
was
too
late
now
so
they
made
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
buried
the
little
one
under
a
birch
tree
when
the
sun
went
down
the
bad
ones
came
home
and
they
wailed
with
false
voices
and
rubbed
their
eyes
to
make
the
tears
come
they
made
their
eyes
red
and
their
noses
too
and
they
did
not
look
any
prettier
for
that
what
is
the
matter
with
you
little
pigeons
said
the
old
merchant
and
his
wife
i
would
not
say
little
pigeons
to
such
bad
ones
crows
is
what
i
would
call
them
and
they
wail
and
lament
aloud
we
are
miserable
for
ever
our
poor
little
sister
is
lost
we
looked
for
her
everywhere
we
heard
the
wolves
howling
they
must
have
eaten
her
the
old
mother
and
father
cried
like
rivers
in
springtime
because
they
loved
the
little
pretty
one
who
was
called
little
stupid
because
she
was
so
good
but
before
their
tears
were
dry
the
bad
ones
began
to
ask
for
the
silver
saucer
and
the
transparent
apple
no
no
says
the
old
man
i
shall
keep
them
for
ever
in
memory
of
my
poor
little
daughter
whom
god
has
taken
away
so
the
bad
ones
did
not
gain
by
killing
their
little
sister
that
is
one
good
thing
said
vanya
but
is
that
all
grandfather
said
maroosia
wait
a
bit
little
pigeons
too
much
haste
set
his
shoes
on
fire
you
listen
and
you
will
hear
what
happened
said
old
peter
he
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
from
a
little
wooden
box
and
then
he
went
on
with
his
tale
time
did
not
stop
with
the
death
of
the
little
girl
winter
came
and
the
snow
with
it
everything
was
all
white
just
as
it
is
now
and
the
wolves
came
to
the
doors
of
the
huts
even
into
the
villages
and
no
one
stirred
farther
than
he
need
and
then
the
snow
melted
and
the
buds
broke
on
the
trees
and
the
birds
began
singing
and
the
sun
shone
warmer
every
dry
the
old
people
had
almost
forgotten
the
little
pretty
one
who
lay
dead
in
the
forest
the
bad
ones
had
not
forgotten
because
now
they
had
to
do
the
work
and
they
did
not
like
that
at
all
and
then
one
day
some
lambs
strayed
away
into
the
forest
and
a
young
shepherd
went
after
them
to
bring
them
safely
back
to
their
mothers
and
as
he
wandered
this
way
and
that
through
the
forest
following
their
light
tracks
he
came
to
a
little
birch
tree
bright
with
new
leaves
waving
over
a
little
mound
of
earth
and
there
was
a
reed
growing
in
the
mound
and
that
you
know
as
well
as
i
is
a
strange
thing
one
reed
all
by
itself
under
a
birch
tree
in
the
forest
but
it
was
no
stranger
than
the
flowers
for
there
were
flowers
round
it
some
red
as
the
sun
at
dawn
and
others
blue
as
the
summer
sky
well
the
shepherd
looks
at
the
reed
and
he
looks
at
those
flowers
and
he
thinks
i
never
seen
anything
like
that
before
i
make
a
of
that
reed
and
keep
it
for
a
memory
till
i
grow
old
so
he
did
he
cut
the
reed
and
sat
himself
down
on
the
mound
and
carved
away
at
the
reed
with
his
knife
and
got
the
pith
out
of
it
by
pushing
a
twig
through
it
and
beating
it
gently
till
the
bark
swelled
made
holes
in
it
and
there
was
his
and
then
he
put
it
to
his
lips
to
see
what
sort
of
music
he
could
make
on
it
but
that
he
never
knew
for
before
his
lips
touched
it
the
began
playing
by
itself
and
reciting
in
a
girl
sweet
voice
this
is
what
it
sang
play
play
bring
happiness
to
my
dear
father
and
to
my
little
mother
i
was
killed
yes
my
life
was
taken
from
me
in
the
deep
forest
for
the
sake
of
a
silver
saucer
for
the
sake
of
a
transparent
apple
when
he
heard
that
the
shepherd
went
back
quickly
to
the
village
to
show
it
to
the
people
and
all
the
way
the
went
on
playing
and
reciting
singing
its
little
song
and
everyone
who
heard
it
said
what
a
strange
song
but
who
is
it
who
was
killed
i
know
nothing
about
it
says
the
shepherd
and
he
tells
them
about
the
mound
and
the
reed
and
the
flowers
and
how
he
cut
the
reed
and
made
the
and
how
the
does
its
playing
by
itself
and
as
he
was
going
through
the
village
with
all
the
people
crowding
about
him
the
old
merchant
that
one
who
was
the
father
of
the
two
bad
ones
and
of
the
little
pretty
one
came
along
and
listened
with
the
rest
and
when
he
heard
the
words
about
the
silver
saucer
and
the
transparent
apple
he
snatched
the
from
the
shepherd
boy
and
still
it
sang
play
play
bring
happiness
to
my
dear
father
and
to
my
little
mother
i
was
killed
yes
my
life
was
taken
from
me
in
the
deep
forest
for
the
sake
of
a
silver
saucer
for
the
sake
of
a
transparent
apple
and
the
old
merchant
remembered
the
little
good
one
and
his
tears
trickled
over
his
cheeks
and
down
his
old
beard
old
men
love
little
pigeons
you
know
and
he
said
to
the
shepherd
take
me
at
once
to
the
mound
where
you
say
you
cut
the
reed
the
shepherd
led
the
way
and
the
old
man
walked
beside
him
crying
while
the
in
his
hand
went
on
singing
and
reciting
its
little
song
over
and
over
again
they
came
to
the
mound
under
the
birch
tree
and
there
were
the
flowers
shining
red
and
blue
and
there
in
the
middle
of
the
mound
was
the
stump
of
the
reed
which
the
shepherd
had
cut
the
sang
on
and
on
well
there
and
then
they
dug
up
the
mound
and
there
was
the
little
girl
lying
under
the
dark
earth
as
if
she
were
asleep
o
god
of
mine
says
the
old
merchant
this
is
my
daughter
my
little
pretty
one
whom
we
called
little
stupid
he
began
to
weep
loudly
and
wring
his
hands
but
the
playing
and
reciting
changed
its
song
this
is
what
it
sang
my
sisters
took
me
into
the
forest
to
look
for
the
red
berries
in
the
deep
forest
they
killed
poor
me
for
the
sake
of
a
silver
saucer
for
the
sake
of
a
transparent
apple
wake
me
dear
father
from
a
bitter
dream
by
fetching
water
from
the
well
of
the
tzar
how
the
people
scowled
at
the
two
sisters
they
scowled
they
cursed
them
for
the
bad
ones
they
were
and
the
bad
ones
the
two
sisters
wept
and
fell
on
their
knees
and
confessed
everything
they
were
taken
and
their
hands
were
tied
and
they
were
shut
up
in
prison
do
not
kill
them
begged
the
old
merchant
for
then
i
should
have
no
daughters
at
all
and
when
there
are
no
fish
in
the
river
we
make
shift
with
crays
besides
let
me
go
to
the
tzar
and
beg
water
from
his
well
perhaps
my
little
daughter
will
wake
up
as
the
tells
us
and
the
sang
again
wake
me
wake
me
dear
father
from
a
bitter
dream
by
fetching
water
from
the
well
of
the
tzar
till
then
dear
father
a
blanket
of
black
earth
and
the
shade
of
the
green
birch
tree
so
they
covered
the
little
girl
with
her
blanket
of
earth
and
the
shepherd
with
his
dogs
watched
the
mound
night
and
day
he
begged
for
the
to
keep
him
company
poor
lad
and
all
the
days
and
nights
he
thought
of
the
sweet
face
of
the
little
pretty
one
he
had
seen
there
under
the
birch
tree
the
old
merchant
harnessed
his
horse
as
if
he
were
going
to
the
town
and
he
drove
off
through
the
forest
along
the
roads
till
he
came
to
the
palace
of
the
tzar
the
little
father
of
all
good
russians
and
then
he
left
his
horse
and
cart
and
waited
on
the
steps
of
the
palace
the
tzar
the
little
father
with
rings
on
his
fingers
and
a
gold
crown
on
his
head
came
out
on
the
steps
in
the
morning
sunshine
and
as
for
the
old
merchant
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
kissed
the
feet
of
the
tzar
and
begged
o
little
father
tzar
give
me
leave
to
take
water
just
a
little
drop
of
water
from
your
holy
well
and
what
will
you
do
with
it
says
the
tzar
i
will
wake
my
daughter
from
a
bitter
dream
says
the
old
merchant
she
was
murdered
by
her
sisters
killed
in
the
deep
forest
for
the
sake
of
a
silver
saucer
for
the
sake
of
a
transparent
apple
a
silver
saucer
says
the
tzar
a
transparent
apple
tell
me
about
that
and
the
old
merchant
told
the
tzar
everything
just
as
i
have
told
it
to
you
and
the
tzar
the
little
father
he
gave
the
old
merchant
a
glass
of
water
from
his
holy
well
but
says
he
when
your
daughterkin
wakes
bring
her
to
me
and
her
sisters
with
her
and
also
the
silver
saucer
and
the
transparent
apple
the
old
man
kissed
the
ground
before
the
tzar
and
took
the
glass
of
water
and
drove
home
with
it
and
i
can
tell
you
he
was
careful
not
to
spill
a
drop
he
carried
it
all
the
way
in
one
hand
as
he
drove
he
came
to
the
forest
and
to
the
flowering
mound
under
the
little
birch
tree
and
there
was
the
shepherd
watching
with
his
dogs
the
old
merchant
and
the
shepherd
took
away
the
blanket
of
black
earth
tenderly
tenderly
the
shepherd
used
his
fingers
until
the
little
girl
the
pretty
one
the
good
one
lay
there
as
sweet
as
if
she
were
not
dead
then
the
merchant
scattered
the
holy
water
from
the
glass
over
the
little
girl
and
his
daughterkin
blushed
as
she
lay
there
and
opened
her
eyes
and
passed
a
hand
across
them
as
if
she
were
waking
from
a
dream
and
then
she
leapt
up
crying
and
laughing
and
clung
about
her
old
father
neck
and
there
they
stood
the
two
of
them
laughing
and
crying
with
joy
and
the
shepherd
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
her
and
in
his
eyes
too
there
were
tears
but
the
old
father
did
not
forget
what
he
had
promised
the
tzar
he
set
the
little
pretty
one
who
had
been
so
good
that
her
wicked
sisters
had
called
her
stupid
to
sit
beside
him
on
the
cart
and
he
brought
something
from
the
house
in
a
coffer
of
wood
and
kept
it
under
his
coat
and
they
brought
out
the
two
sisters
the
bad
ones
from
their
dark
prison
and
set
them
in
the
cart
and
the
little
stupid
kissed
them
and
cried
over
them
and
wanted
to
loose
their
hands
but
the
old
merchant
would
not
let
her
and
they
all
drove
together
till
they
came
to
the
palace
of
the
tzar
the
shepherd
boy
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
the
little
pretty
one
and
he
ran
all
the
way
behind
the
cart
well
they
came
to
the
palace
and
waited
on
the
steps
and
the
tzar
came
out
to
take
the
morning
air
and
he
saw
the
old
merchant
and
the
two
sisters
with
their
hands
tied
and
the
little
pretty
one
as
lovely
as
a
spring
day
and
the
tzar
saw
her
and
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
her
he
did
not
see
the
shepherd
boy
who
hid
away
among
the
crowd
says
the
great
tzar
to
his
soldiers
pointing
to
the
bad
sisters
these
two
are
to
be
put
to
death
at
sunset
when
the
sun
goes
down
their
heads
must
come
off
for
they
are
not
fit
to
see
another
day
then
he
turns
to
the
little
pretty
one
and
he
says
little
sweet
pigeon
where
is
your
silver
saucer
and
where
is
your
transparent
apple
the
old
merchant
took
the
wooden
box
from
under
his
coat
and
opened
it
with
a
key
at
his
belt
and
gave
it
to
the
little
one
and
she
took
out
the
silver
saucer
and
the
transparent
apple
and
gave
them
to
the
tzar
o
lord
tzar
says
she
o
little
father
spin
the
apple
in
the
saucer
and
you
will
see
whatever
you
wish
to
see
your
soldiers
your
high
hills
your
forests
your
plains
your
rivers
and
everything
in
all
russia
and
the
tzar
the
little
father
spun
the
apple
in
the
saucer
till
it
seemed
a
little
whirlpool
of
white
mist
and
there
he
saw
glittering
towns
and
regiments
of
soldiers
marching
to
war
and
ships
and
day
and
night
and
the
clear
stars
above
the
trees
he
looked
at
these
things
and
thought
much
of
them
then
the
little
good
one
threw
herself
on
her
knees
before
him
weeping
o
little
father
tzar
she
says
take
my
transparent
apple
and
my
silver
saucer
only
forgive
my
sisters
do
not
kill
them
because
of
me
if
their
heads
are
cut
off
when
the
sun
goes
down
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
to
lie
under
the
blanket
of
black
earth
in
the
shade
of
the
birch
tree
in
the
forest
the
tzar
was
pleased
with
the
kind
heart
of
the
little
pretty
one
and
he
forgave
the
bad
ones
and
their
hands
were
untied
and
the
little
pretty
one
kissed
them
and
they
kissed
her
again
and
said
they
were
sorry
the
old
merchant
looked
up
at
the
sun
and
saw
how
the
time
was
going
well
well
says
he
it
time
we
were
getting
ready
to
go
home
they
all
fell
on
their
knees
before
the
tzar
and
thanked
him
but
the
tzar
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
the
little
pretty
one
and
would
not
let
her
go
little
sweet
pigeon
says
he
will
you
be
my
tzaritza
and
a
kind
mother
to
holy
russia
and
the
little
good
one
did
not
know
what
to
say
she
blushed
and
answered
very
rightly
as
my
father
orders
and
as
my
little
mother
wishes
so
shall
it
be
the
tzar
was
pleased
with
her
answer
and
he
sent
a
messenger
on
a
galloping
horse
to
ask
leave
from
the
little
pretty
one
old
mother
and
of
course
the
old
mother
said
that
she
was
more
than
willing
so
that
was
all
right
then
there
was
a
wedding
such
a
wedding
and
every
city
in
russia
sent
a
silver
plate
of
bread
and
a
golden
with
their
good
wishes
to
the
tzar
and
tzaritza
only
the
shepherd
boy
when
he
heard
that
the
little
pretty
one
was
to
marry
the
tzar
turned
sadly
away
and
went
off
into
the
forest
are
you
happy
little
sweet
pigeon
says
the
tzar
oh
yes
says
the
little
stupid
who
was
now
tzaritza
and
mother
of
holy
russia
but
there
is
one
thing
that
would
make
me
happier
and
what
is
that
says
the
lord
tzar
i
can
not
bear
to
lose
my
old
father
and
my
little
mother
and
my
dear
sisters
let
them
be
with
me
here
in
the
palace
as
they
were
in
my
father
house
the
tzar
laughed
at
the
little
pretty
one
but
he
agreed
and
the
little
pretty
one
ran
to
tell
them
the
good
news
she
said
to
her
sisters
let
all
be
forgotten
and
all
be
forgiven
and
may
the
evil
eye
fall
on
the
one
who
first
speaks
of
what
has
been
for
a
long
time
the
tzar
lived
and
the
little
pretty
one
the
tzaritza
and
they
had
many
children
and
were
very
happy
together
and
ever
since
then
the
tzars
of
russia
have
kept
the
silver
saucer
and
the
transparent
apple
so
that
whenever
they
wish
they
can
see
everything
that
is
going
on
all
over
russia
perhaps
even
now
the
tzar
the
little
father
god
preserve
him
is
spinning
the
apple
in
the
saucer
and
looking
at
us
and
thinking
it
is
time
that
two
little
pigeons
were
in
bed
is
that
the
end
said
vanya
that
is
the
end
said
old
peter
poor
shepherd
boy
said
maroosia
i
do
know
about
that
said
old
peter
you
see
if
he
had
married
the
little
pretty
one
and
had
to
have
all
the
family
to
live
with
him
he
would
have
had
them
in
a
hut
like
ours
instead
of
in
a
great
palace
and
so
he
would
never
have
had
room
to
get
away
from
them
and
now
little
pigeons
who
is
going
to
be
first
into
bed
sadko
in
novgorod
in
the
old
days
there
was
a
young
man
just
a
boy
he
was
the
son
of
a
rich
merchant
who
had
lost
all
his
money
and
died
so
sadko
was
very
poor
he
had
not
a
kopeck
in
the
world
except
what
the
people
gave
him
when
he
played
his
dulcimer
for
their
dancing
he
had
blue
eyes
and
curling
hair
and
he
was
strong
and
would
have
been
merry
but
it
is
dull
work
playing
for
other
folk
to
dance
and
sadko
dared
not
dance
with
any
young
girl
for
he
had
no
money
to
marry
on
and
he
did
not
want
to
be
chased
away
as
a
beggar
and
the
young
women
of
novgorod
they
never
looked
at
the
handsome
sadko
no
they
smiled
with
their
bright
eyes
at
the
young
men
who
danced
with
them
and
if
they
ever
spoke
to
sadko
it
was
just
to
tell
him
sharply
to
keep
the
music
going
or
to
play
faster
so
sadko
lived
alone
with
his
dulcimer
and
made
do
with
half
a
loaf
when
he
could
not
get
a
whole
and
with
crust
when
he
had
no
crumb
he
did
not
mind
so
very
much
what
came
to
him
so
long
as
he
could
play
his
dulcimer
and
walk
along
the
banks
of
the
little
river
volkhov
that
flows
by
novgorod
or
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
making
music
for
himself
and
seeing
the
pale
mists
rise
over
the
water
and
dawn
or
sunset
across
the
shining
river
there
is
no
girl
in
all
novgorod
as
pretty
as
my
little
river
he
used
to
say
and
night
after
night
he
would
sit
by
the
banks
of
the
river
or
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
playing
the
dulcimer
and
singing
to
himself
sometimes
he
helped
the
fishermen
on
the
lake
and
they
would
give
him
a
little
fish
for
his
supper
in
payment
for
his
strong
young
arms
and
it
happened
that
one
evening
the
fishermen
asked
him
to
watch
their
nets
for
them
on
the
shore
while
they
went
off
to
take
their
fish
to
sell
them
in
the
square
at
novgorod
footnote
the
volkhov
would
be
a
big
river
if
it
were
in
england
and
sadko
and
old
peter
called
it
little
only
because
they
loved
it
sadko
sat
on
the
shore
on
a
rock
and
played
his
dulcimer
and
sang
very
sweetly
he
sang
of
the
fair
lake
and
the
lovely
river
the
little
river
that
he
thought
prettier
than
all
the
girls
of
novgorod
and
while
he
was
singing
he
saw
a
whirlpool
in
the
lake
little
waves
flying
from
it
across
the
water
and
in
the
middle
a
hollow
down
into
the
water
and
in
the
hollow
he
saw
the
head
of
a
great
man
with
blue
hair
and
a
gold
crown
he
knew
that
the
huge
man
was
the
tzar
of
the
sea
and
the
man
came
nearer
walking
up
out
of
the
depths
of
the
lake
a
huge
great
man
a
very
giant
with
blue
hair
falling
to
his
waist
over
his
broad
shoulders
the
little
waves
ran
from
him
in
all
directions
as
he
came
striding
up
out
of
the
water
sadko
did
not
know
whether
to
run
or
stay
but
the
tzar
of
the
sea
called
out
to
him
in
a
great
voice
like
wind
and
water
in
a
storm
sadko
of
novgorod
you
have
played
and
sung
many
days
by
the
side
of
this
lake
and
on
the
banks
of
the
little
river
volkhov
my
daughters
love
your
music
and
it
has
pleased
me
too
throw
out
a
net
into
the
water
and
draw
it
in
and
the
waters
will
pay
you
for
your
singing
and
if
you
are
satisfied
with
the
payment
you
must
come
and
play
to
us
down
in
the
green
palace
of
the
sea
with
that
the
tzar
of
the
sea
went
down
again
into
the
waters
of
the
lake
the
waves
closed
over
him
with
a
roar
and
presently
the
lake
was
as
smooth
and
calm
as
it
had
ever
been
sadko
thought
and
said
to
himself
well
there
is
no
harm
done
in
casting
out
a
net
so
he
threw
a
net
out
into
the
lake
he
sat
down
again
and
played
on
his
dulcimer
and
sang
and
when
he
had
finished
his
singing
the
dusk
had
fallen
and
the
moon
shone
over
the
lake
he
put
down
his
dulcimer
and
took
hold
of
the
ropes
of
the
net
and
began
to
draw
it
up
out
of
the
silver
water
easily
the
ropes
came
and
the
net
dripping
and
glittering
in
the
moonlight
i
was
dreaming
said
sadko
i
was
asleep
when
i
saw
the
tzar
of
the
sea
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
net
at
all
and
then
just
as
the
last
of
the
net
was
coming
ashore
he
saw
something
in
it
square
and
dark
he
dragged
it
out
and
found
it
was
a
coffer
he
opened
the
coffer
and
it
was
full
of
precious
stones
green
red
gold
gleaming
in
the
light
of
the
moon
diamonds
shone
there
like
little
bundles
of
sharp
knives
there
can
be
no
harm
in
taking
these
stones
says
sadko
whether
i
dreamed
or
not
he
took
the
coffer
on
his
shoulder
and
bent
under
the
weight
of
it
strong
though
he
was
he
put
it
in
a
safe
place
all
night
he
sat
and
watched
by
the
nets
and
played
and
sang
and
planned
what
he
would
do
in
the
morning
the
fishermen
came
laughing
and
merry
after
their
night
in
novgorod
and
they
gave
him
a
little
fish
for
watching
their
nets
and
he
made
a
fire
on
the
shore
and
cooked
it
and
ate
it
as
he
used
to
do
and
that
is
my
last
meal
as
a
poor
man
says
sadko
ah
me
who
knows
if
i
shall
be
happier
then
he
set
the
coffer
on
his
shoulder
and
tramped
away
for
novgorod
who
is
that
they
asked
at
the
gates
only
sadko
the
dulcimer
player
he
replied
turned
porter
said
they
one
trade
is
as
good
as
another
said
sadko
and
he
walked
into
the
city
he
sold
a
few
of
the
stones
two
at
a
time
and
with
what
he
got
for
them
he
set
up
a
booth
in
the
market
small
things
led
to
great
and
he
was
soon
one
of
the
richest
traders
in
novgorod
and
now
there
was
not
a
girl
in
the
town
who
could
look
too
sweetly
at
sadko
he
has
golden
hair
says
one
blue
eyes
like
the
sea
says
another
he
could
lift
the
world
on
his
shoulders
says
a
third
a
little
money
you
see
opens
everybody
eyes
but
sadko
was
not
changed
by
his
good
fortune
still
he
walked
and
played
by
the
little
river
volkhov
when
work
was
done
and
the
traders
gone
sadko
would
take
his
dulcimer
and
play
and
sing
on
the
banks
of
the
river
and
still
he
said
there
is
no
girl
in
all
novgorod
as
pretty
as
my
little
river
every
time
he
came
back
from
his
long
voyages
for
he
was
trading
far
and
near
like
the
greatest
of
merchants
he
went
at
once
to
the
banks
of
the
river
to
see
how
his
sweetheart
fared
and
always
he
brought
some
little
present
for
her
and
threw
it
into
the
waves
for
twelve
years
he
lived
unmarried
in
novgorod
and
every
year
made
voyages
buying
and
selling
and
always
growing
richer
and
richer
many
were
the
mothers
in
novgorod
who
would
have
liked
to
see
him
married
to
their
daughters
many
were
the
pillows
that
were
wet
with
the
tears
of
the
young
girls
as
they
thought
of
the
blue
eyes
of
sadko
and
his
golden
hair
and
then
in
the
twelfth
year
since
he
walked
into
novgorod
with
the
coffer
on
his
shoulder
he
was
sailing
in
a
ship
on
the
caspian
sea
far
far
away
for
many
days
the
ship
sailed
on
and
sadko
sat
on
deck
and
played
his
dulcimer
and
sang
of
novgorod
and
of
the
little
river
volkhov
that
flows
under
the
walls
of
the
town
blue
was
the
caspian
sea
and
the
waves
were
like
furrows
in
a
field
long
lines
of
white
under
the
steady
wind
while
the
sails
swelled
and
the
ship
shot
over
the
water
and
suddenly
the
ship
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
sea
far
from
land
the
ship
stopped
and
trembled
in
the
waves
as
if
she
were
held
by
a
big
hand
we
are
aground
cry
the
sailors
and
the
captain
the
great
one
tells
them
to
take
soundings
seventy
fathoms
by
the
bow
it
was
and
seventy
fathoms
by
the
stern
we
are
not
aground
says
the
captain
unless
there
is
a
rock
sticking
up
like
a
needle
in
the
middle
of
the
caspian
sea
there
is
magic
in
this
say
the
sailors
hoist
more
sail
says
the
captain
and
up
go
the
white
sails
swelling
out
in
the
wind
while
the
masts
bend
and
creak
but
still
the
ship
lay
shivering
and
did
not
move
out
there
in
the
middle
of
the
sea
hoist
more
sail
yet
says
the
captain
and
up
go
the
white
sails
swelling
and
tugging
while
the
masts
creak
and
groan
but
still
the
ship
lay
there
shivering
and
did
not
move
there
is
an
unlucky
one
aboard
says
an
old
sailor
we
must
draw
lots
and
find
him
and
throw
him
overboard
into
the
sea
the
other
sailors
agreed
to
this
and
still
sadko
sat
and
played
his
dulcimer
and
sang
the
sailors
cut
pieces
of
string
all
of
a
length
as
many
as
there
were
souls
in
the
ship
and
one
of
those
strings
they
cut
in
half
then
they
made
them
into
a
bundle
and
each
man
plucked
one
string
and
sadko
stopped
his
playing
for
a
moment
to
pluck
a
string
and
his
was
the
string
that
had
been
cut
in
half
magician
sorcerer
unclean
one
shouted
the
sailors
not
so
said
sadko
i
remember
now
an
old
promise
i
made
and
i
keep
it
willingly
he
took
his
dulcimer
in
his
hand
and
leapt
from
the
ship
into
the
blue
caspian
sea
the
waves
had
scarcely
closed
over
his
head
before
the
ship
shot
forward
again
and
flew
over
the
waves
like
a
feather
and
came
in
the
end
safely
to
her
harbour
and
what
happened
to
sadko
asked
maroosia
you
shall
hear
little
pigeon
said
old
peter
and
he
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
then
he
went
on
sadko
dropped
into
the
waves
and
the
waves
closed
over
him
down
he
sank
like
a
pebble
thrown
into
a
pool
down
and
down
first
the
water
was
blue
then
green
and
strange
fish
with
goggle
eyes
and
golden
fins
swam
round
him
as
he
sank
he
came
at
last
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
there
on
the
bottom
of
the
sea
was
a
palace
built
of
green
wood
yes
all
the
timbers
of
all
the
ships
that
have
been
wrecked
in
all
the
seas
of
the
world
are
in
that
palace
and
they
are
all
green
and
cunningly
fitted
together
so
that
the
palace
is
worth
a
ten
journey
only
to
see
it
and
in
front
of
the
palace
sadko
saw
two
big
kobbly
sturgeons
each
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
long
lashing
their
tails
and
guarding
the
gates
now
sturgeons
are
the
oldest
of
all
fish
and
these
were
the
oldest
of
all
sturgeons
sadko
walked
between
the
sturgeons
and
through
the
gates
of
the
palace
inside
there
was
a
great
hall
and
the
tzar
of
the
sea
lay
resting
in
the
hall
with
his
gold
crown
on
his
head
and
his
blue
hair
floating
round
him
in
the
water
and
his
great
body
covered
with
scales
lying
along
the
hall
the
tzar
of
the
sea
filled
the
hall
and
there
is
room
in
that
hall
for
a
village
and
there
were
fish
swimming
this
way
and
that
in
and
out
of
the
windows
ah
sadko
says
the
tzar
of
the
sea
you
took
what
the
sea
gave
you
but
you
have
been
a
long
time
in
coming
to
sing
in
the
palaces
of
the
sea
twelve
years
i
have
lain
here
waiting
for
you
great
tzar
forgive
says
sadko
sing
now
says
the
tzar
of
the
sea
and
his
voice
was
like
the
beating
of
waves
and
sadko
played
on
his
dulcimer
and
sang
he
sang
of
novgorod
and
of
the
little
river
volkhov
which
he
loved
it
was
in
his
song
that
none
of
the
girls
of
novgorod
were
as
pretty
as
the
little
river
and
there
was
the
sound
of
wind
over
the
lake
in
his
song
the
sound
of
ripples
under
the
prow
of
a
boat
the
sound
of
ripples
on
the
shore
the
sound
of
the
river
flowing
past
the
tall
reeds
the
whispering
sound
of
the
river
at
night
and
all
the
time
he
played
cunningly
on
the
dulcimer
the
girls
of
novgorod
had
never
danced
to
so
sweet
a
tune
when
in
the
old
days
sadko
played
his
dulcimer
to
earn
kopecks
and
crusts
of
bread
never
had
the
tzar
of
the
sea
heard
such
music
i
would
dance
said
the
tzar
of
the
sea
and
he
stood
up
like
a
tall
tree
in
the
hall
play
on
said
the
tzar
of
the
sea
and
he
strode
through
the
gates
the
sturgeons
guarding
the
gates
stirred
the
water
with
their
tails
and
if
the
tzar
of
the
sea
was
huge
in
the
hall
he
was
huger
still
when
he
stood
outside
on
the
bottom
of
the
sea
he
grew
taller
and
taller
towering
like
a
mountain
his
feet
were
like
small
hills
his
blue
hair
hung
down
to
his
waist
and
he
was
covered
with
green
scales
and
he
began
to
dance
on
the
bottom
of
the
sea
great
was
that
dancing
the
sea
boiled
and
ships
went
down
the
waves
rolled
as
big
as
houses
the
sea
overflowed
its
shores
and
whole
towns
were
under
water
as
the
tzar
danced
mightily
on
the
bottom
of
the
sea
hither
and
thither
rushed
the
waves
and
the
very
earth
shook
at
the
dancing
of
that
tremendous
tzar
he
danced
till
he
was
tired
and
then
he
came
back
to
the
palace
of
green
wood
and
passed
the
sturgeons
and
shrank
into
himself
and
came
through
the
gates
into
the
hall
where
sadko
still
played
on
his
dulcimer
and
sang
you
have
played
well
and
given
me
pleasure
says
the
tzar
of
the
sea
i
have
thirty
daughters
and
you
shall
choose
one
and
marry
her
and
be
a
prince
of
the
sea
better
than
all
maidens
i
love
my
little
river
says
sadko
and
the
tzar
of
the
sea
laughed
and
threw
his
head
back
with
his
blue
hair
floating
all
over
the
hall
and
then
there
came
in
the
thirty
daughters
of
the
tzar
of
the
sea
beautiful
they
were
lovely
and
graceful
but
of
them
passed
by
and
sadko
fingered
his
dulcimer
and
thought
of
his
little
river
there
came
in
the
thirtieth
and
sadko
cried
out
aloud
here
is
the
only
maiden
in
the
world
as
pretty
as
my
little
river
says
he
and
she
looked
at
him
with
eyes
that
shone
like
stars
reflected
in
the
river
her
hair
was
dark
like
the
river
at
night
she
laughed
and
her
voice
was
like
the
flowing
of
the
river
and
what
is
the
name
of
your
little
river
says
the
tzar
it
is
the
little
river
volkhov
that
flows
by
novgorod
says
sadko
but
your
daughter
is
as
fair
as
the
little
river
and
i
would
gladly
marry
her
if
she
will
have
me
it
is
a
strange
thing
says
the
tzar
but
volkhov
is
the
name
of
my
youngest
daughter
he
put
sadko
hand
in
the
hand
of
his
youngest
daughter
and
they
kissed
each
other
and
as
they
kissed
sadko
saw
a
necklace
round
her
neck
and
knew
it
for
one
he
had
thrown
into
the
river
as
a
present
for
his
sweetheart
she
smiled
and
come
says
she
and
took
him
away
to
a
palace
of
her
own
and
showed
him
a
coffer
and
in
that
coffer
were
bracelets
and
rings
and
earrings
all
the
gifts
that
he
had
thrown
into
the
river
and
sadko
laughed
for
joy
and
kissed
the
youngest
daughter
of
the
tzar
of
the
sea
and
she
kissed
him
back
o
my
little
river
says
he
there
is
no
girl
in
all
the
world
but
thou
as
pretty
as
my
little
river
well
they
were
married
and
the
tzar
of
the
sea
laughed
at
the
wedding
feast
till
the
palace
shook
and
the
fish
swam
off
in
all
directions
and
after
the
feast
sadko
and
his
bride
went
off
together
to
her
palace
and
before
they
slept
she
kissed
him
very
tenderly
and
she
said
o
sadko
you
will
not
forget
me
you
will
play
to
me
sometimes
and
sing
i
shall
never
lose
sight
of
you
my
pretty
one
says
he
and
as
for
music
i
will
sing
and
play
all
the
day
long
that
as
may
be
says
she
and
they
fell
asleep
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
sadko
happened
to
turn
in
bed
and
he
touched
the
princess
with
his
left
foot
and
she
was
cold
cold
cold
as
ice
in
january
and
with
that
touch
of
cold
he
woke
and
he
was
lying
under
the
walls
of
novgorod
with
his
dulcimer
in
his
hand
and
one
of
his
feet
was
in
the
little
river
volkhov
and
the
moon
was
shining
o
grandfather
and
what
happened
to
him
after
that
asked
maroosia
there
are
many
tales
said
old
peter
some
say
he
went
into
the
town
and
lived
on
alone
until
he
died
but
i
think
with
those
who
say
that
he
took
his
dulcimer
and
swam
out
into
the
middle
of
the
river
and
sank
under
water
again
looking
for
his
little
princess
they
say
he
found
her
and
lives
still
in
the
green
palaces
of
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
when
there
is
a
big
storm
you
may
know
that
sadko
is
playing
on
his
dulcimer
and
singing
and
that
the
tzar
of
the
sea
is
dancing
his
tremendous
dance
down
there
on
the
bottom
under
the
waves
yes
i
expect
that
what
happened
said
ivan
he
have
found
it
very
dull
in
novgorod
even
though
it
is
a
big
town
frost
the
children
in
their
little
sheepskin
coats
and
high
felt
boots
and
fur
hats
trudged
along
the
forest
path
in
the
snow
vanya
went
first
then
maroosia
and
then
old
peter
the
ground
was
white
and
the
snow
was
hard
and
crisp
and
all
over
the
forest
could
be
heard
the
crackling
of
the
frost
and
as
they
walked
old
peter
told
them
the
story
of
the
old
woman
who
wanted
frost
to
marry
her
daughters
once
upon
a
time
there
were
an
old
man
and
an
old
woman
now
the
old
woman
was
the
old
man
second
wife
his
first
wife
had
died
and
had
left
him
with
a
little
daughter
martha
she
was
called
then
he
married
again
and
god
gave
him
a
cross
wife
and
with
her
two
more
daughters
and
they
were
very
different
from
the
first
the
old
woman
loved
her
own
daughters
and
gave
them
red
kisel
jelly
every
day
and
honey
too
as
much
as
they
could
put
into
their
greedy
little
mouths
but
poor
little
martha
the
eldest
she
got
only
what
the
others
left
when
they
were
cross
they
threw
away
what
they
left
and
then
she
got
nothing
at
all
the
children
grew
older
and
the
stepmother
made
martha
do
all
the
work
of
the
house
she
had
to
fetch
the
wood
for
the
stove
and
light
it
and
keep
it
burning
she
had
to
draw
the
water
for
her
sisters
to
wash
their
hands
in
she
had
to
make
the
clothes
and
wash
them
and
mend
them
she
had
to
cook
the
dinner
and
clean
the
dishes
after
the
others
had
done
before
having
a
bite
for
herself
for
all
that
the
stepmother
was
never
satisfied
and
was
for
ever
shouting
at
her
look
the
kettle
is
in
the
wrong
place
there
is
dust
on
the
floor
there
is
a
spot
on
the
tablecloth
or
the
spoons
are
not
clean
you
stupid
ugly
idle
hussy
but
martha
was
not
idle
she
worked
all
day
long
and
got
up
before
the
sun
while
her
sisters
never
stirred
from
their
beds
till
it
was
time
for
dinner
and
she
was
not
stupid
she
always
had
a
song
on
her
lips
except
when
her
stepmother
had
beaten
her
and
as
for
being
ugly
she
was
the
prettiest
little
girl
in
the
village
her
father
saw
all
this
but
he
could
not
do
anything
for
the
old
woman
was
mistress
at
home
and
he
was
terribly
afraid
of
her
and
as
for
the
daughters
they
saw
how
their
mother
treated
martha
and
they
did
the
same
they
were
always
complaining
and
getting
her
into
trouble
it
was
a
pleasure
to
them
to
see
the
tears
on
her
pretty
cheeks
well
time
went
on
and
the
little
girl
grew
up
and
the
daughters
of
the
stepmother
were
as
ugly
as
could
be
their
eyes
were
always
cross
and
their
mouths
were
always
complaining
their
mother
saw
that
no
one
would
want
to
marry
either
of
them
while
there
was
martha
about
the
house
with
her
bright
eyes
and
her
songs
and
her
kindness
to
everybody
so
she
thought
of
a
way
to
get
rid
of
her
stepdaughter
and
a
cruel
way
it
was
see
here
old
man
says
she
it
is
high
time
martha
was
married
and
i
have
a
bridegroom
in
mind
for
her
morning
you
must
harness
the
old
mare
to
the
sledge
and
put
a
bit
of
food
together
and
be
ready
to
start
early
as
i
like
to
see
you
back
before
night
to
martha
she
said
you
must
pack
your
things
in
a
box
and
put
on
your
best
dress
to
show
yourself
to
your
betrothed
who
is
he
asked
martha
with
red
cheeks
you
will
know
when
you
see
him
said
the
stepmother
all
that
night
martha
hardly
slept
she
could
hardly
believe
that
she
was
really
going
to
escape
from
the
old
woman
at
last
and
have
a
hut
of
her
own
where
there
would
be
no
one
to
scold
her
she
wondered
who
the
young
man
was
she
hoped
he
was
fedor
ivanovitch
who
had
such
kind
eyes
and
such
nimble
fingers
on
the
balalaika
and
such
a
merry
way
of
flinging
out
his
heels
when
he
danced
the
russian
dance
but
although
he
always
smiled
at
her
when
they
met
she
felt
she
hardly
dared
to
hope
that
it
was
he
early
in
the
morning
she
got
up
and
said
her
prayers
to
god
put
the
whole
hut
in
order
and
packed
her
things
into
a
little
box
that
was
easy
because
she
had
such
few
things
it
was
the
other
daughters
who
had
new
dresses
any
old
thing
was
good
enough
for
martha
but
she
put
on
her
best
blue
dress
and
there
she
was
as
pretty
a
little
maid
as
ever
walked
under
the
birch
trees
in
spring
the
old
man
harnessed
the
mare
to
the
sledge
and
brought
it
to
the
door
the
snow
was
very
deep
and
frozen
hard
and
the
wind
peeled
the
skin
from
his
ears
before
he
covered
them
with
the
flaps
of
his
fur
hat
sit
down
at
the
table
and
have
a
bite
before
you
go
says
the
old
woman
the
old
man
sat
down
and
his
daughter
with
him
and
drank
a
glass
of
tea
and
ate
some
black
bread
and
the
old
woman
put
some
cabbage
soup
left
from
the
day
before
in
a
saucer
and
said
to
martha
eat
this
my
little
pigeon
and
get
ready
for
the
road
but
when
she
said
my
little
pigeon
she
did
not
smile
with
her
eyes
but
only
with
her
cruel
mouth
and
martha
was
afraid
the
old
woman
whispered
to
the
old
man
i
have
a
word
for
you
old
fellow
you
will
take
martha
to
her
betrothed
and
i
tell
you
the
way
you
go
straight
along
and
then
take
the
road
to
the
right
into
the
forest
you
know
straight
to
the
big
fir
tree
that
stands
on
a
hillock
and
there
you
will
give
martha
to
her
betrothed
and
leave
her
he
will
be
waiting
for
her
and
his
name
is
frost
the
old
man
stared
opened
his
mouth
and
stopped
eating
the
little
maid
who
had
heard
the
last
words
began
to
cry
now
what
are
you
whimpering
about
screamed
the
old
woman
frost
is
a
rich
bridegroom
and
a
handsome
one
see
how
much
he
owns
all
the
pines
and
firs
are
his
and
the
birch
trees
any
one
would
envy
his
possessions
and
he
himself
is
a
very
bogatir
a
man
of
strength
and
power
the
old
man
trembled
and
said
nothing
in
reply
and
martha
went
on
crying
quietly
though
she
tried
to
stop
her
tears
the
old
man
packed
up
what
was
left
of
the
black
bread
told
martha
to
put
on
her
sheepskin
coat
set
her
in
the
sledge
and
climbed
in
and
drove
off
along
the
white
frozen
road
the
road
was
long
and
the
country
open
and
the
wind
grew
colder
and
colder
while
the
frozen
snow
blew
up
from
under
the
hoofs
of
the
mare
and
spattered
the
sledge
with
white
patches
the
tale
is
soon
told
but
it
takes
time
to
happen
and
the
sledge
was
white
all
over
long
before
they
turned
off
into
the
forest
they
came
in
the
end
deep
into
the
forest
and
left
the
road
and
over
the
deep
snow
through
the
trees
to
the
great
fir
there
the
old
man
stopped
told
his
daughter
to
get
out
of
the
sledge
set
her
little
box
under
the
fir
and
said
wait
here
for
your
bridegroom
and
when
he
comes
be
sure
to
receive
him
with
kind
words
then
he
turned
the
mare
round
and
drove
home
with
the
tears
running
from
his
eyes
and
freezing
on
his
cheeks
before
they
had
had
time
to
reach
his
beard
footnote
the
bogatirs
were
strong
men
heroes
of
old
russia
the
little
maid
sat
and
trembled
her
sheepskin
coat
was
worn
through
and
in
her
blue
bridal
dress
she
sat
while
fits
of
shivering
shook
her
whole
body
she
wanted
to
run
away
but
she
had
not
strength
to
move
or
even
to
keep
her
little
white
teeth
from
chattering
between
her
frozen
lips
suddenly
not
far
away
she
heard
frost
crackling
among
the
fir
trees
just
as
he
is
crackling
now
he
was
leaping
from
tree
to
tree
crackling
as
he
came
he
leapt
at
last
into
the
great
fir
tree
under
which
the
little
maid
was
sitting
he
crackled
in
the
top
of
the
tree
and
then
called
down
out
of
the
topmost
branches
are
you
warm
little
maid
warm
warm
little
father
frost
frost
laughed
and
came
a
little
lower
in
the
tree
and
crackled
and
crackled
louder
than
before
then
he
asked
are
you
still
warm
little
maid
are
you
warm
little
red
cheeks
the
little
maid
could
hardly
speak
she
was
nearly
dead
but
she
answered
warm
dear
frost
warm
little
father
frost
climbed
lower
in
the
tree
and
crackled
louder
than
ever
and
asked
are
you
still
warm
little
maid
are
you
warm
little
red
cheeks
are
you
warm
little
paws
the
little
maid
was
benumbed
all
over
but
she
whispered
so
that
frost
could
just
hear
her
warm
little
pigeon
warm
dear
frost
and
frost
was
sorry
for
her
leapt
down
with
a
tremendous
crackle
and
a
scattering
of
frozen
snow
wrapped
the
little
maid
up
in
rich
furs
and
covered
her
with
warm
blankets
in
the
morning
the
old
woman
said
to
her
husband
drive
off
now
to
the
forest
and
wake
the
young
couple
the
old
man
wept
when
he
thought
of
his
little
daughter
for
he
was
sure
that
he
would
find
her
dead
he
harnessed
the
mare
and
drove
off
through
the
snow
he
came
to
the
tree
and
heard
his
little
daughter
singing
merrily
while
frost
crackled
and
laughed
there
she
was
alive
and
warm
with
a
good
fur
cloak
about
her
shoulders
a
rich
veil
costly
blankets
round
her
feet
and
a
box
full
of
splendid
presents
the
old
man
did
not
say
a
word
he
was
too
surprised
he
just
sat
in
the
sledge
staring
while
the
little
maid
lifted
her
box
and
the
box
of
presents
set
them
in
the
sledge
climbed
in
and
sat
down
beside
him
they
came
home
and
the
little
maid
martha
fell
at
the
feet
of
her
stepmother
the
old
woman
nearly
went
off
her
head
with
rage
when
she
saw
her
alive
with
her
fur
cloak
and
rich
veil
and
the
box
of
splendid
presents
fit
for
the
daughter
of
a
prince
ah
you
slut
she
cried
you
wo
get
round
me
like
that
and
she
would
not
say
another
word
to
the
little
maid
but
went
about
all
day
long
biting
her
nails
and
thinking
what
to
do
at
night
she
said
to
the
old
man
you
must
take
my
daughters
too
to
that
bridegroom
in
the
forest
he
will
give
them
better
gifts
than
these
things
take
time
to
happen
but
the
tale
is
quickly
told
early
next
morning
the
old
woman
woke
her
daughters
fed
them
with
good
food
dressed
them
like
brides
hustled
the
old
man
made
him
put
clean
hay
in
the
sledge
and
warm
blankets
and
sent
them
off
to
the
forest
the
old
man
did
as
he
was
bid
drove
to
the
big
fir
tree
set
the
boxes
under
the
tree
lifted
out
the
stepdaughters
and
set
them
on
the
boxes
side
by
side
and
drove
back
home
they
were
warmly
dressed
these
two
and
well
fed
and
at
first
as
they
sat
there
they
did
not
think
about
the
cold
i
ca
think
what
put
it
into
mother
head
to
marry
us
both
at
once
said
the
first
and
to
send
us
here
to
be
married
as
if
there
were
not
enough
young
men
in
the
village
who
can
tell
what
sort
of
fellows
we
shall
meet
here
then
they
began
to
quarrel
well
says
one
of
them
i
beginning
to
get
the
cold
shivers
if
our
fated
ones
do
not
come
soon
we
shall
perish
of
cold
it
a
flat
lie
to
say
that
bridegrooms
get
ready
early
it
already
what
if
only
one
comes
you
have
to
come
another
time
you
think
he
look
at
you
well
he
wo
take
you
anyhow
of
course
he
take
me
take
you
first
it
enough
to
make
any
one
laugh
they
began
to
fight
and
scratch
each
other
so
that
their
cloaks
fell
open
and
the
cold
entered
their
bosoms
illustration
there
she
was
a
good
fur
cloak
about
her
shoulders
and
costly
blankets
round
her
feet
frost
crackling
among
the
trees
laughing
to
himself
froze
the
hands
of
the
two
quarrelling
girls
and
they
hid
their
hands
in
the
sleeves
of
their
fur
coats
and
shivered
and
went
on
scolding
and
jeering
at
each
other
oh
you
ugly
mug
dirty
nose
what
sort
of
a
housekeeper
will
you
make
and
what
about
you
boasting
one
you
know
nothing
but
how
to
gad
about
and
lick
your
own
face
we
soon
see
which
of
us
he
take
and
the
two
girls
went
on
wrangling
and
wrangling
till
they
began
to
freeze
in
good
earnest
suddenly
they
cried
out
together
devil
take
these
bridegrooms
for
being
so
long
in
coming
you
have
turned
blue
all
over
and
together
they
replied
shivering
no
bluer
than
yourself
and
frost
not
so
far
away
crackled
and
laughed
and
leapt
from
fir
tree
to
fir
tree
crackling
as
he
came
the
girls
heard
that
some
one
was
coming
through
the
forest
listen
there
some
one
coming
yes
and
with
bells
on
his
sledge
shut
up
you
slut
i
ca
hear
and
the
frost
is
taking
the
skin
off
me
they
began
blowing
on
their
fingers
and
frost
came
nearer
and
nearer
crackling
laughing
talking
to
himself
just
as
he
is
doing
nearer
and
nearer
he
came
leaping
from
to
till
at
last
he
leapt
into
the
great
fir
under
which
the
two
girls
were
sitting
and
quarrelling
he
leant
down
looking
through
the
branches
and
asked
are
you
warm
maidens
are
you
warm
little
red
cheeks
are
you
warm
little
pigeons
ugh
frost
the
cold
is
hurting
us
we
are
frozen
we
are
waiting
for
our
bridegrooms
but
the
cursed
fellows
have
not
turned
up
frost
came
a
little
lower
in
the
tree
and
crackled
louder
and
swifter
are
you
warm
maidens
are
you
warm
my
little
red
cheeks
go
to
the
devil
they
cried
out
are
you
blind
our
hands
and
feet
are
frozen
frost
came
still
lower
in
the
branches
and
cracked
and
crackled
louder
than
ever
are
you
warm
maidens
he
asked
into
the
pit
with
you
with
all
the
fiends
the
girls
screamed
at
him
you
ugly
wretched
fellow
and
as
they
were
cursing
at
him
their
bad
words
died
on
their
lips
for
the
two
girls
the
cross
children
of
the
cruel
stepmother
were
frozen
stiff
where
they
sat
frost
hung
from
the
lowest
branches
of
the
tree
swaying
and
crackling
while
he
looked
at
the
anger
frozen
on
their
faces
then
he
climbed
swiftly
up
again
and
crackling
and
cracking
chuckling
to
himself
he
went
off
leaping
from
fir
tree
to
fir
tree
this
way
and
that
through
the
white
frozen
forest
in
the
morning
the
old
woman
says
to
her
husband
now
then
old
man
harness
the
mare
to
the
sledge
and
put
new
hay
in
the
sledge
to
be
warm
for
my
little
ones
and
lay
fresh
rushes
on
the
hay
to
be
soft
for
them
and
take
warm
rugs
with
you
for
maybe
they
will
be
cold
even
in
their
furs
and
look
sharp
about
it
and
keep
them
waiting
the
frost
is
hard
this
morning
and
it
was
harder
in
the
night
the
old
man
had
not
time
to
eat
even
a
mouthful
of
black
bread
before
she
had
driven
him
out
into
the
snow
he
put
hay
and
rushes
and
soft
blankets
in
the
sledge
and
harnessed
the
mare
and
went
off
to
the
forest
he
came
to
the
great
fir
and
found
the
two
girls
sitting
under
it
dead
with
their
anger
still
to
be
seen
on
their
frozen
ugly
faces
he
picked
them
up
first
one
and
then
the
other
and
put
them
in
the
rushes
and
the
warm
hay
covered
them
with
the
blankets
and
drove
home
the
old
woman
saw
him
coming
far
away
over
the
shining
snow
she
ran
to
meet
him
and
shouted
out
where
are
the
little
ones
in
the
sledge
she
snatched
off
the
blankets
and
pulled
aside
the
rushes
and
found
the
bodies
of
her
two
cross
daughters
instantly
she
flew
at
the
old
man
in
a
storm
of
rage
what
have
you
done
to
my
children
my
little
red
cherries
my
little
pigeons
i
will
kill
you
with
the
oven
fork
i
will
break
your
head
with
the
poker
the
old
man
listened
till
she
was
out
of
breath
and
could
not
say
another
word
that
my
dears
is
the
only
wise
thing
to
do
when
a
woman
is
in
a
scolding
rage
and
as
soon
as
she
had
no
breath
left
with
which
to
answer
him
he
said
my
little
daughter
got
riches
for
soft
words
but
yours
were
always
rough
of
the
tongue
and
it
not
my
fault
anyhow
for
you
yourself
sent
them
into
the
forest
well
at
last
the
old
woman
got
her
breath
again
and
scolded
away
till
she
was
tired
out
but
in
the
end
she
made
her
peace
with
the
old
man
and
they
lived
together
as
quietly
as
could
be
expected
as
for
martha
fedor
ivanovitch
sought
her
in
marriage
as
he
had
meant
to
do
all
along
yes
and
married
her
and
pretty
she
looked
in
the
furs
that
frost
had
given
her
i
was
at
the
feast
and
drank
beer
and
mead
with
the
rest
and
she
had
the
prettiest
children
that
ever
were
seen
yes
and
the
best
behaved
for
if
ever
they
thought
of
being
naughty
the
old
grandfather
told
them
the
story
of
crackling
frost
and
how
kind
words
won
kindness
and
cross
words
cold
treatment
and
now
listen
to
frost
hear
how
he
crackles
away
and
mind
if
ever
he
asks
you
if
you
are
warm
be
as
polite
to
him
as
you
can
and
to
do
that
the
best
way
is
to
be
good
always
like
little
martha
then
it
comes
easy
the
children
listened
and
laughed
quietly
because
they
knew
they
were
good
away
in
the
forest
they
heard
frost
and
thought
of
him
crackling
and
leaping
from
one
tree
to
another
and
just
then
they
came
home
it
was
dusk
for
dusk
comes
early
in
winter
and
a
little
way
through
the
trees
before
them
they
saw
the
lamp
of
their
hut
glittering
on
the
snow
the
big
dog
barked
and
ran
forward
and
the
children
with
him
the
soup
was
warm
on
the
stove
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
sitting
at
the
table
vanya
maroosia
and
old
peter
blowing
at
their
steaming
spoons
the
fool
of
the
world
and
the
flying
ship
there
were
once
upon
a
time
an
old
peasant
and
his
wife
and
they
had
three
sons
two
of
them
were
clever
young
men
who
could
borrow
money
without
being
cheated
but
the
third
was
the
fool
of
the
world
he
was
as
simple
as
a
child
simpler
than
some
children
and
he
never
did
any
one
a
harm
in
his
life
well
it
always
happens
like
that
the
father
and
mother
thought
a
lot
of
the
two
smart
young
men
but
the
fool
of
the
world
was
lucky
if
he
got
enough
to
eat
because
they
always
forgot
him
unless
they
happened
to
be
looking
at
him
and
sometimes
even
then
but
however
it
was
with
his
father
and
mother
this
is
a
story
that
shows
that
god
loves
simple
folk
and
turns
things
to
their
advantage
in
the
end
for
it
happened
that
the
tzar
of
that
country
sent
out
messengers
along
the
highroads
and
the
rivers
even
to
huts
in
the
forest
like
ours
to
say
that
he
would
give
his
daughter
the
princess
in
marriage
to
any
one
who
could
bring
him
a
flying
ship
ay
a
ship
with
wings
that
should
sail
this
way
and
that
through
the
blue
sky
like
a
ship
sailing
on
the
sea
this
is
a
chance
for
us
said
the
two
clever
brothers
and
that
same
day
they
set
off
together
to
see
if
one
of
them
could
not
build
the
flying
ship
and
marry
the
tzar
daughter
and
so
be
a
great
man
indeed
and
their
father
blessed
them
and
gave
them
finer
clothes
than
ever
he
wore
himself
and
their
mother
made
them
up
hampers
of
food
for
the
road
soft
white
rolls
and
several
kinds
of
cooked
meats
and
bottles
of
corn
brandy
she
went
with
them
as
far
as
the
highroad
and
waved
her
hand
to
them
till
they
were
out
of
sight
and
so
the
two
clever
brothers
set
merrily
off
on
their
adventure
to
see
what
could
be
done
with
their
cleverness
and
what
happened
to
them
i
do
not
know
for
they
were
never
heard
of
again
the
fool
of
the
world
saw
them
set
off
with
their
fine
parcels
of
food
and
their
fine
clothes
and
their
bottles
of
corn
brandy
i
like
to
go
too
says
he
and
eat
good
meat
with
soft
white
rolls
and
drink
corn
brandy
and
marry
the
tzar
daughter
stupid
fellow
says
his
mother
what
the
good
of
your
going
why
if
you
were
to
stir
from
the
house
you
would
walk
into
the
arms
of
a
bear
and
if
not
that
then
the
wolves
would
eat
you
before
you
had
finished
staring
at
them
but
the
fool
of
the
world
would
not
be
held
back
by
words
i
am
going
says
he
i
am
going
i
am
going
i
am
going
he
went
on
saying
this
over
and
over
again
till
the
old
woman
his
mother
saw
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
and
was
glad
to
get
him
out
of
the
house
so
as
to
be
quit
of
the
sound
of
his
voice
so
she
put
some
food
in
a
bag
for
him
to
eat
by
the
way
she
put
in
the
bag
some
crusts
of
dry
black
bread
and
a
flask
of
water
she
did
not
even
bother
to
go
as
far
as
the
footpath
to
see
him
on
his
way
she
saw
the
last
of
him
at
the
door
of
the
hut
and
he
had
not
taken
two
steps
before
she
had
gone
back
into
the
hut
to
see
to
more
important
business
no
matter
the
fool
of
the
world
set
off
with
his
bag
over
his
shoulder
singing
as
he
went
for
he
was
off
to
seek
his
fortune
and
marry
the
tzar
daughter
he
was
sorry
his
mother
had
not
given
him
any
corn
brandy
but
he
sang
merrily
for
all
that
he
would
have
liked
white
rolls
instead
of
the
dry
black
crusts
but
after
all
the
main
thing
on
a
journey
is
to
have
something
to
eat
so
he
trudged
merrily
along
the
road
and
sang
because
the
trees
were
green
and
there
was
a
blue
sky
overhead
he
had
not
gone
very
far
when
he
met
an
ancient
old
man
with
a
bent
back
and
a
long
beard
and
eyes
hidden
under
his
bushy
eyebrows
young
fellow
says
the
ancient
old
man
grandfather
says
the
fool
of
the
world
and
where
are
you
off
to
says
the
ancient
old
man
what
says
the
fool
have
you
heard
the
tzar
is
going
to
give
his
daughter
to
any
one
who
can
bring
him
a
flying
ship
and
you
can
really
make
a
flying
ship
says
the
ancient
old
man
no
i
do
not
know
how
then
what
are
you
going
to
do
god
knows
says
the
fool
of
the
world
well
says
the
ancient
if
things
are
like
that
sit
you
down
here
we
will
rest
together
and
have
a
bite
of
food
bring
out
what
you
have
in
your
bag
i
am
ashamed
to
offer
you
what
i
have
here
it
is
good
enough
for
me
but
it
is
not
the
sort
of
meal
to
which
one
can
ask
guests
never
mind
that
out
with
it
let
us
eat
what
god
has
given
the
fool
of
the
world
opened
his
bag
and
could
hardly
believe
his
eyes
instead
of
black
crusts
he
saw
fresh
white
rolls
and
cooked
meats
he
handed
them
out
to
the
ancient
who
said
you
see
how
god
loves
simple
folk
although
your
own
mother
does
not
love
you
you
have
not
been
done
out
of
your
share
of
the
good
things
let
have
a
sip
at
the
corn
brandy
the
fool
of
the
world
opened
his
flask
and
instead
of
water
there
came
out
corn
brandy
and
that
of
the
best
so
the
fool
and
the
ancient
made
merry
eating
and
drinking
and
when
they
had
done
and
sung
a
song
or
two
together
the
ancient
says
to
the
fool
listen
to
me
off
with
you
into
the
forest
go
up
to
the
first
big
tree
you
see
make
the
sacred
sign
of
the
cross
three
times
before
it
strike
it
a
blow
with
your
little
hatchet
fall
backwards
on
the
ground
and
lie
there
full
length
on
your
back
until
somebody
wakes
you
up
then
you
will
find
the
ship
made
all
ready
to
fly
sit
you
down
in
it
and
fly
off
whither
you
want
to
go
but
be
sure
on
the
way
to
give
a
lift
to
everyone
you
meet
the
fool
of
the
world
thanked
the
ancient
old
man
said
to
him
and
went
off
to
the
forest
he
walked
up
to
a
tree
the
first
big
tree
he
saw
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
three
times
before
it
swung
his
hatchet
round
his
head
struck
a
mighty
blow
on
the
trunk
of
the
tree
instantly
fell
backwards
flat
on
the
ground
closed
his
eyes
and
went
to
sleep
a
little
time
went
by
and
it
seemed
to
the
fool
as
he
slept
that
somebody
was
jogging
his
elbow
he
woke
up
and
opened
his
eyes
his
hatchet
worn
out
lay
beside
him
the
big
tree
was
gone
and
in
its
place
there
stood
a
little
ship
ready
and
finished
the
fool
did
not
stop
to
think
he
jumped
into
the
ship
seized
the
tiller
and
sat
down
instantly
the
ship
leapt
up
into
the
air
and
sailed
away
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
the
little
ship
answered
the
tiller
as
readily
as
if
she
were
sailing
in
water
and
the
fool
steered
for
the
highroad
and
sailed
along
above
it
for
he
was
afraid
of
losing
his
way
if
he
tried
to
steer
a
course
across
the
open
country
he
flew
on
and
on
and
looked
down
and
saw
a
man
lying
in
the
road
below
him
with
his
ear
on
the
damp
ground
to
you
uncle
cried
the
fool
to
you
cried
the
man
what
are
you
doing
down
there
says
the
fool
i
am
listening
to
all
that
is
being
done
in
the
world
take
your
place
in
the
ship
with
me
the
man
was
willing
enough
and
sat
down
in
the
ship
with
the
fool
and
they
flew
on
together
singing
songs
they
flew
on
and
on
and
looked
down
and
there
was
a
man
on
one
leg
with
the
other
tied
up
to
his
head
uncle
says
the
fool
bringing
the
ship
to
the
ground
why
are
you
hopping
along
on
one
foot
if
i
were
to
untie
the
other
i
should
move
too
fast
i
should
be
stepping
across
the
world
in
a
single
stride
sit
down
with
us
says
the
fool
the
man
sat
down
with
them
in
the
ship
and
they
flew
on
together
singing
songs
they
flew
on
and
on
and
looked
down
and
there
was
a
man
with
a
gun
and
he
was
taking
aim
but
what
he
was
aiming
at
they
could
not
see
good
health
to
you
uncle
says
the
fool
but
what
are
you
shooting
at
there
is
a
bird
to
be
seen
what
says
the
man
if
there
were
a
bird
that
you
could
see
i
should
not
shoot
at
it
a
bird
or
a
beast
a
thousand
versts
away
that
the
sort
of
mark
for
me
take
your
seat
with
us
says
the
fool
the
man
sat
down
with
them
in
the
ship
and
they
flew
on
together
louder
and
louder
rose
their
songs
they
flew
on
and
on
and
looked
down
and
there
was
a
man
carrying
a
sack
full
of
bread
on
his
back
good
health
to
you
uncle
says
the
fool
sailing
down
and
where
are
you

to
i
am
going
to
get
bread
for
my
dinner
but

a
full
sack
on
your
back
that
that
little
scrap
why
that
not
enough
for
a
single
mouthful
take
your
seat
with
us
says
the
fool
the
eater
sat
down
with
them
in
the
ship
and
they
flew
on
together
singing
louder
than
ever
they
flew
on
and
on
and
looked
down
and
there
was
a
man
walking
round
and
round
a
lake
good
health
to
you
uncle
says
the
fool
what
are
you
looking
for
i
want
a
drink
and
i
ca
find
any
water
but
there
a
whole
lake
in
front
of
your
eyes
why
ca
you
take
a
drink
from
that
that
little
drop
says
the
man
why
there
not
enough
water
there
to
wet
the
back
of
my
throat
if
i
were
to
drink
it
at
one
gulp
take
your
seat
with
us
says
the
fool
the
drinker
sat
down
with
them
and
again
they
flew
on
singing
in
chorus
they
flew
on
and
on
and
looked
down
and
there
was
a
man
walking
towards
the
forest
with
a
fagot
of
wood
on
his
shoulders
to
you
uncle
says
the
fool
why
are
you
taking
wood
to
the
forest
this
is
simple
wood
says
the
man
what
is
it
then
says
the
fool
if
it
is
scattered
about
a
whole
army
of
soldiers
leaps
up
out
of
the
ground
there
a
place
for
you
with
us
says
the
fool
the
man
sat
down
with
them
and
the
ship
rose
up
into
the
air
and
flew
on
carrying
its
singing
crew
they
flew
on
and
on
and
looked
down
and
there
was
a
man
carrying
a
sack
of
straw
good
health
to
you
uncle
says
the
fool
and
where
are
you
taking
your
straw
to
the
village
why
are
they
short
of
straw
in
your
village
no
but
this
is
such
straw
that
if
you
scatter
it
abroad
in
the
very
hottest
of
the
summer
instantly
the
weather
turns
cold
and
there
is
snow
and
frost
there
a
place
here
for
you
too
says
the
fool
very
kind
of
you
says
the
man
and
steps
in
and
sits
down
and
away
they
all
sail
together
singing
like
to
burst
their
lungs
they
did
not
meet
any
one
else
and
presently
came
flying
up
to
the
palace
of
the
tzar
they
flew
down
and
cast
anchor
in
the
courtyard
just
then
the
tzar
was
eating
his
dinner
he
heard
their
loud
singing
and
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
the
ship
come
sailing
down
into
his
courtyard
he
sent
his
servant
out
to
ask
who
was
the
great
prince
who
had
brought
him
the
flying
ship
and
had
come
sailing
down
with
such
a
merry
noise
of
singing
the
servant
came
up
to
the
ship
and
saw
the
fool
of
the
world
and
his
companions
sitting
there
cracking
jokes
he
saw
they
were
all
moujiks
simple
peasants
sitting
in
the
ship
so
he
did
not
stop
to
ask
questions
but
came
back
quietly
and
told
the
tzar
that
there
were
no
gentlemen
in
the
ship
at
all
but
only
a
lot
of
dirty
peasants
now
the
tzar
was
not
at
all
pleased
with
the
idea
of
giving
his
only
daughter
in
marriage
to
a
simple
peasant
and
he
began
to
think
how
he
could
get
out
of
his
bargain
thinks
he
to
himself
i
set
them
such
tasks
that
they
will
not
be
able
to
perform
and
they
be
glad
to
get
off
with
their
lives
and
i
shall
get
the
ship
for
nothing
so
he
told
his
servant
to
go
to
the
fool
and
tell
him
that
before
the
tzar
had
finished
his
dinner
the
fool
was
to
bring
him
some
of
the
magical
water
of
life
now
while
the
tzar
was
giving
this
order
to
his
servant
the
listener
the
first
of
the
fool
companions
was
listening
and
heard
the
words
of
the
tzar
and
repeated
them
to
the
fool
what
am
i
to
do
now
says
the
fool
stopping
short
in
his
jokes
in
a
year
in
a
whole
century
i
never
could
find
that
water
and
he
wants
it
before
he
has
finished
his
dinner
do
you
worry
about
that
says
the
i
deal
with
that
for
you
the
servant
came
and
announced
the
tzar
command
tell
him
he
shall
have
it
says
the
fool
his
companion
the
untied
his
foot
from
beside
his
head
put
it
to
the
ground
wriggled
it
a
little
to
get
the
stiffness
out
of
it
ran
off
and
was
out
of
sight
almost
before
he
had
stepped
from
the
ship
quicker
than
i
can
tell
it
you
in
words
he
had
come
to
the
water
of
life
and
put
some
of
it
in
a
bottle
i
shall
have
plenty
of
time
to
get
back
thinks
he
and
down
he
sits
under
a
windmill
and
goes
off
to
sleep
the
royal
dinner
was
coming
to
an
end
and
there
was
a
sign
of
him
there
were
no
songs
and
no
jokes
in
the
flying
ship
everybody
was
watching
for
the
and
thinking
he
would
not
be
in
time
the
listener
jumped
out
and
laid
his
right
ear
to
the
damp
ground
listened
a
moment
and
said
what
a
fellow
he
has
gone
to
sleep
under
the
windmill
i
can
hear
him
snoring
and
there
is
a
fly
buzzing
with
its
wings
perched
on
the
windmill
close
above
his
head
this
is
my
affair
says
the
and
he
picked
up
his
gun
from
between
his
knees
aimed
at
the
fly
on
the
windmill
and
woke
the
with
the
thud
of
the
bullet
on
the
wood
of
the
mill
close
by
his
head
the
leapt
up
and
ran
and
in
less
than
a
second
had
brought
the
magic
water
of
life
and
given
it
to
the
fool
the
fool
gave
it
to
the
servant
who
took
it
to
the
tzar
the
tzar
had
not
yet
left
the
table
so
that
his
command
had
been
fulfilled
as
exactly
as
ever
could
be
what
fellows
these
peasants
are
thought
the
tzar
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
set
them
another
task
so
the
tzar
said
to
his
servant
go
to
the
captain
of
the
flying
ship
and
give
him
this
message
you
are
such
a
cunning
fellow
you
must
have
a
good
appetite
let
you
and
your
companions
eat
at
a
single
meal
twelve
oxen
roasted
whole
and
as
much
bread
as
can
be
baked
in
forty
ovens
the
listener
heard
the
message
and
told
the
fool
what
was
coming
the
fool
was
terrified
and
said
i
ca
get
through
even
a
single
loaf
at
a
sitting
do
worry
about
that
said
the
eater
it
wo
be
more
than
a
mouthful
for
me
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
a
little
snack
in
place
of
my
dinner
the
servant
came
and
announced
the
tzar
command
good
says
the
fool
send
the
food
along
and
we
know
what
to
do
with
it
so
they
brought
twelve
oxen
roasted
whole
and
as
much
bread
as
could
be
baked
in
forty
ovens
and
the
companions
had
scarcely
sat
down
to
the
meal
before
the
eater
had
finished
the
lot
why
said
the
eater
what
a
little
they
might
have
given
us
a
decent
meal
while
they
were
about
it
the
tzar
told
his
servant
to
tell
the
fool
that
he
and
his
companions
were
to
drink
forty
barrels
of
wine
with
forty
bucketfuls
in
every
barrel
the
listener
told
the
fool
what
message
was
coming
why
says
the
fool
i
never
in
my
life
drank
more
than
one
bucket
at
a
time
do
worry
says
the
drinker
you
forget
that
i
am
thirsty
be
nothing
of
a
drink
for
me
they
brought
the
forty
barrels
of
wine
and
tapped
them
and
the
drinker
tossed
them
down
one
after
another
one
gulp
for
each
barrel
little
enough
says
he
why
i
am
thirsty
still
very
good
says
the
tzar
to
his
servant
when
he
heard
that
they
had
eaten
all
the
food
and
drunk
all
the
wine
tell
the
fellow
to
get
ready
for
the
wedding
and
let
him
go
and
bathe
himself
in
the
but
let
the
be
made
so
hot
that
the
man
will
stifle
and
frizzle
as
soon
as
he
sets
foot
inside
it
is
an
iron
let
it
be
made
red
hot
the
listener
heard
all
this
and
told
the
fool
who
stopped
short
with
his
mouth
open
in
the
middle
of
a
joke
do
you
worry
says
the
moujik
with
the
straw
well
they
made
the
red
hot
and
called
the
fool
and
the
fool
went
along
to
the
to
wash
himself
and
with
him
went
the
moujik
with
the
straw
they
shut
them
both
into
the
and
thought
that
that
was
the
end
of
them
but
the
moujik
scattered
his
straw
before
them
as
they
went
in
and
it
became
so
cold
in
there
that
the
fool
of
the
world
had
scarcely
time
to
wash
himself
before
the
water
in
the
cauldrons
froze
to
solid
ice
they
lay
down
on
the
very
stove
itself
and
spent
the
night
there
shivering
in
the
morning
the
servants
opened
the
and
there
were
the
fool
of
the
world
and
the
moujik
alive
and
well
lying
on
the
stove
and
singing
songs
they
told
the
tzar
and
the
tzar
raged
with
anger
there
is
no
getting
rid
of
this
fellow
says
he
but
go
and
tell
him
that
i
send
him
this
message
you
are
to
marry
my
daughter
you
must
show
that
you
are
able
to
defend
her
let
me
see
that
you
have
at
least
a
regiment
of
soldiers
thinks
he
to
himself
how
can
a
simple
peasant
raise
a
troop
he
will
find
it
hard
enough
to
raise
a
single
soldier
the
listener
told
the
fool
of
the
world
and
the
fool
began
to
lament
this
time
says
he
i
am
done
indeed
you
my
brothers
have
saved
me
from
misfortune
more
than
once
but
this
time
alas
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
oh
what
a
fellow
you
are
says
the
peasant
with
the
fagot
of
wood
i
suppose
you
forgotten
about
me
remember
that
i
am
the
man
for
this
little
affair
and
do
you
worry
about
it
at
all
the
tzar
servant
came
along
and
gave
his
message
very
good
says
the
fool
but
tell
the
tzar
that
if
after
this
he
puts
me
off
again
i
make
war
on
his
country
and
take
the
princess
by
force
and
then
as
the
servant
went
back
with
the
message
the
whole
crew
on
the
flying
ship
set
to
their
singing
again
and
sang
and
laughed
and
made
jokes
as
if
they
had
not
a
care
in
the
world
during
the
night
while
the
others
slept
the
peasant
with
the
fagot
of
wood
went
hither
and
thither
scattering
his
sticks
instantly
where
they

sometimes

sometimes
it
walks
solemnly
about
but
in
some
of
the
stories
she
lives
in
another
kind
of
hut
with
a
railing
of
tall
sticks
and
a
skull
on
each
stick
and
all
night
long
fire
glows
in

and

as

of

one
little
girl
got

and
then
if

you
you

know
exactly
what
to
do
and
old
peter
put
down
his
pipe
and
began
baba
yaga
and
the
little
girl
with
the
kind
heart
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
widowed
old
man
who
lived
alone
in
a
hut
with
his
little
daughter
very
merry
they
were
together
and
they
used
to
smile
at
each
other
over
a
table
just
piled
with
bread
and
jam
everything
went
well
until
the
old
man
took
it
into
his
head
to
marry
again
yes
the
old
man
became
foolish
in
the
years
of
his
old
age
and
he
took
another
wife
and
so
the
poor
little
girl
had
a
stepmother
and
after
that
everything
changed
there
was
no
more
bread
and
jam
on
the
table
and
no
more
playing
first
this
side
of
the
samovar
and
then
that
as
she
sat
with
her
father
at
tea
it
was
worse
than
that
for
she
never
did
sit
at
tea
the
stepmother
said
that
everything
that
went
wrong
was
the
little
girl
fault
and
the
old
man
believed
his
new
wife
and
so
there
were
no
more
kind
words
for
his
little
daughter
day
after
day
the
stepmother
used
to
say
that
the
little
girl
was
too
naughty
to
sit
at
table
and
then
she
would
throw
her
a
crust
and
tell
her
to
get
out
of
the
hut
and
go
and
eat
it
somewhere
else
and
the
poor
little
girl
used
to
go
away
by
herself
into
the
shed
in
the
yard
and
wet
the
dry
crust
with
her
tears
and
eat
it
all
alone
ah
me
she
often
wept
for
the
old
days
and
she
often
wept
at
the
thought
of
the
days
that
were
to
come
mostly
she
wept
because
she
was
all
alone
until
one
day
she
found
a
little
friend
in
the
shed
she
was
hunched
up
in
a
corner
of
the
shed
eating
her
crust
and
crying
bitterly
when
she
heard
a
little
noise
it
was
like
this
scratch
scratch
it
was
just
that
a
little
gray
mouse
who
lived
in
a
hole
out
he
came
his
little
pointed
nose
and
his
long
whiskers
his
little
round
ears
and
his
bright
eyes
out
came
his
little
humpy
body
and
his
long
tail
and
then
he
sat
up
on
his
hind
legs
and
curled
his
tail
twice
round
himself
and
looked
at
the
little
girl
the
little
girl
who
had
a
kind
heart
forgot
all
her
sorrows
and
took
a
scrap
of
her
crust
and
threw
it
to
the
little
mouse
the
mouseykin
nibbled
and
nibbled
and
there
it
was
gone
and
he
was
looking
for
another
she
gave
him
another
bit
and
presently
that
was
gone
and
another
and
another
until
there
was
no
crust
left
for
the
little
girl
well
she
did
mind
that
you
see
she
was
so
happy
seeing
the
little
mouse
nibbling
and
nibbling
when
the
crust
was
done
the
mouseykin
looks
up
at
her
with
his
little
bright
eyes
and
thank
you
he
says
in
a
little
squeaky
voice
thank
you
he
says
you
are
a
kind
little
girl
and
i
am
only
a
mouse
and
i
eaten
all
your
crust
but
there
is
one
thing
i
can
do
for
you
and
that
is
to
tell
you
to
take
care
the
old
woman
in
the
hut
and
that
was
the
cruel
stepmother
is
own
sister
to
baba
yaga
the
the
witch
so
if
ever
she
sends
you
on
a
message
to
your
aunt
you
come
and
tell
me
for
baba
yaga
would
eat
you
soon
enough
with
her
iron
teeth
if
you
did
not
know
what
to
do
oh
thank
you
said
the
little
girl
and
just
then
she
heard
the
stepmother
calling
to
her
to
come
in
and
clean
up
the
tea
things
and
tidy
the
house
and
brush
out
the
floor
and
clean
everybody
boots
so
off
she
had
to
go
when
she
went
in
she
had
a
good
look
at
her
stepmother
and
sure
enough
she
had
a
long
nose
and
she
was
as
bony
as
a
fish
with
all
the
flesh
picked
off
and
the
little
girl
thought
of
baba
yaga
and
shivered
though
she
did
not
feel
so
bad
when
she
remembered
the
mouseykin
out
there
in
the
shed
in
the
yard
the
very
next
morning
it
happened
the
old
man
went
off
to
pay
a
visit
to
some
friends
of
his
in
the
next
village
just
as
i
go
off
sometimes
to
see
old
fedor
god
be
with
him
and
as
soon
as
the
old
man
was
out
of
sight
the
wicked
stepmother
called
the
little
girl
you
are
to
go
to
your
dear
little
aunt
in
the
forest
says
she
and
ask
her
for
a
needle
and
thread
to
mend
a
shirt
but
here
is
a
needle
and
thread
says
the
little
girl
hold
your
tongue
says
the
stepmother
and
she
gnashes
her
teeth
and
they
make
a
noise
like
clattering
tongs
hold
your
tongue
she
says
did
i
tell
you
you
are
to
go
to
your
dear
little
aunt
to
ask
for
a
needle
and
thread
to
mend
a
shirt
how
shall
i
find
her
says
the
little
girl
nearly
ready
to
cry
for
she
knew
that
her
aunt
was
baba
yaga
the
the
witch
the
stepmother
took
hold
of
the
little
girl
nose
and
pinched
it
that
is
your
nose
she
says
can
you
feel
it
yes
says
the
poor
little
girl
you
must
go
along
the
road
into
the
forest
till
you
come
to
a
fallen
tree
then
you
must
turn
to
your
left
and
then
follow
your
nose
and
you
will
find
her
says
the
stepmother
now
be
off
with
you
lazy
one
here
is
some
food
for
you
to
eat
by
the
way
she
gave
the
little
girl
a
bundle
wrapped
up
in
a
towel
the
little
girl
wanted
to
go
into
the
shed
to
tell
the
mouseykin
she
was
going
to
baba
yaga
and
to
ask
what
she
should
do
but
she
looked
back
and
there
was
the
stepmother
at
the
door
watching
her
so
she
had
to
go
straight
on
she
walked
along
the
road
through
the
forest
till
she
came
to
the
fallen
tree
then
she
turned
to
the
left
her
nose
was
still
hurting
where
the
stepmother
had
pinched
it
so
she
knew
she
had
to
go
straight
ahead
she
was
just
setting
out
when
she
heard
a
little
noise
under
the
fallen
tree
scratch
scratch
and
out
jumped
the
little
mouse
and
sat
up
in
the
road
in
front
of
her
o
mouseykin
mouseykin
says
the
little
girl
my
stepmother
has
sent
me
to
her
sister
and
that
is
baba
yaga
the
the
witch
and
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
it
will
not
be
difficult
says
the
little
mouse
because
of
your
kind
heart
take
all
the
things
you
find
in
the
road
and
do
with
them
what
you
like
then
you
will
escape
from
baba
yaga
and
everything
will
be
well
are
you
hungry
mouseykin
said
the
little
girl
i
could
nibble
i
think
says
the
little
mouse
the
little
girl
unfastened
the
towel
and
there
was
nothing
in
it
but
stones
that
was
what
the
stepmother
had
given
the
little
girl
to
eat
by
the
way
oh
i
so
sorry
says
the
little
girl
there
nothing
for
you
to
eat
is
there
said
mouseykin
and
as
she
looked
at
them
the
little
girl
saw
the
stones
turn
to
bread
and
jam
the
little
girl
sat
down
on
the
fallen
tree
and
the
little
mouse
sat
beside
her
and
they
ate
bread
and
jam
until
they
were
not
hungry
any
more
keep
the
towel
says
the
little
mouse
i
think
it
will
be
useful
and
remember
what
i
said
about
the
things
you
find
on
the
way
and
now
says
he
says
the
little
girl
and
runs
along
as
she
was
running
along
she
found
a
nice
new
handkerchief
lying
in
the
road
she
picked
it
up
and
took
it
with
her
then
she
found
a
little
bottle
of
oil

picked
it
up
and
took
it
with
her
then
she
found
some
scraps
of

blue
ribbon
and
she

found
a
little
loaf
of
good
bread
and
she
took
that
too

them
to
move

sorry
for
them
how

girl
i
see
to
that
says
the
thin
black
cat
the
cat
took
the
little
girl
place
at
the
loom
clickety
clack
clickety
clack
the
loom
never
stopped
for
a
moment
the
little
girl
looked
to
see
that
baba
yaga
was
in
the
and
then
she
jumped
down
from
the
little
hut
on
hen
legs
and
ran
to
the
gates
as
fast
as
her
legs
could
flicker
the
big
dog
leapt
up
to
tear
her
to
pieces
just
as
he
was
going
to
spring
on
her
he
saw
who
she
was
why
this
is
the
little
girl
who
gave
me
the
loaf
says
he
a
good
journey
to
you
little
girl
and
he
lay
down
again
with
his
head
between
his
paws
when
she
came
to
the
gates
they
opened
quietly
quietly
without
making
any
noise
at
all
because
of
the
oil
she
had
poured
into
their
hinges
outside
the
gates
there
was
a
little
birch
tree
that
beat
her
in
the
eyes
so
that
she
could
not
go
by
how
lucky
says
the
little
girl
that
i
picked
up
the
ribbon
and
she
tied
up
the
birch
tree
with
the
pretty
blue
ribbon
and
the
birch
tree
was
so
pleased
with
the
ribbon
that
it
stood
still
admiring
itself
and
let
the
little
girl
go
by
how
she
did
run
meanwhile
the
thin
black
cat
sat
at
the
loom
clickety
clack
clickety
clack
sang
the
loom
but
you
never
saw
such
a
tangle
as
the
tangle
made
by
the
thin
black
cat
and
presently
baba
yaga
came
to
the
window
are
you
weaving
little
niece
she
asked
are
you
weaving
my
pretty
i
am
weaving

says
the
thin
black
cat
tangling
and
tangling
while
the
loom
went
clickety
clack
clickety
clack
that
not
the
voice
of
my
little
dinner
says
baba
yaga
and
she
jumped
into
the
hut
gnashing
her
iron
teeth
and
there
was
no
little
girl
but
only
the
thin
black
cat
sitting
at
the
loom
tangling
and
tangling
the
threads
grr
says
baba
yaga
and
jumps
for
the
cat
and
begins
banging
it
about
why
did
you
tear
the
little
girl
eyes
out
in
all
the
years
i
have
served
you
says
the
cat
you
have
only
given
me
one
little
bone
but
the
kind
little
girl
gave
me
scraps
of
meat
baba
yaga
threw
the
cat
into
a
corner
and
went
out
into
the
yard
why
did
you
squeak
when
she
opened
you
she
asked
the
gates
why
did
you
tear
her
to
pieces
she
asked
the
dog
why
did
you
beat
her
in
the
face
and
not
let
her
go
by
she
asked
the
birch
tree
why
were
you
so
long
in
getting
the
bath
ready
if
you
had
been
quicker
she
never
would
have
got
away
said
baba
yaga
to
the
servant
and
she
rushed
about
the
yard
beating
them
all
and
scolding
at
the
top
of
her
voice
ah
said
the
gates
in
all
the
years
we
have
served
you
you
never
even
eased
us
with
water
but
the
kind
little
girl
poured
good
oil
into
our
hinges
ah
said
the
dog
in
all
the
years
i
served
you
you
never
threw
me
anything
but
burnt
crusts
but
the
kind
little
girl
gave
me
a
good
loaf
ah
said
the
little
birch
tree
in
all
the
years
i
served
you
you
never
tied
me
up
even
with
thread
but
the
kind
little
girl
tied
me
up
with
a
gay
blue
ribbon
ah
said
the
servant
in
all
the
years
i
served
you
you
have
never
given
me
even
a
rag
but
the
kind
little
girl
gave
me
a
pretty
handkerchief
baba
yaga
gnashed
at
them
with
her
iron
teeth
then
she
jumped
into
the
mortar
and
sat
down
she
drove
it
along
with
the
pestle
and
swept
up
her
tracks
with
a
besom
and
flew
off
in
pursuit
of
the
little
girl
the
little
girl
ran
and
ran
she
put
her
ear
to
the
ground
and
listened
bang
bang
bangety
bang
she
could
hear
baba
yaga
beating
the
mortar
with
the
pestle
baba
yaga
was
quite
close
there
she
was
beating
with
the
pestle
and
sweeping
with
the
besom
coming
along
the
road
as
quickly
as
she
could
the
little
girl
took
out
the
towel
and
threw
it
on
the
ground
and
the
towel
grew
bigger
and
bigger
and
wetter
and
wetter
and
there
was
a
deep
broad
river
between
baba
yaga
and
the
little
girl
the
little
girl
turned
and
ran
on
how
she
ran
baba
yaga
came
flying
up
in
the
mortar
but
the
mortar
could
not
float
in
the
river
with
baba
yaga
inside
she
drove
it
in
but
only
got
wet
for
her
trouble
tongs
and
pokers
tumbling
down
a
chimney
are
nothing
to
the
noise
she
made
as
she
gnashed
her
iron
teeth
she
turned
home
and
went
flying
back
to
the
little
hut
on
hen
legs
then
she
got
together
all
her
cattle
and
drove
them
to
the
river
drink
drink
she
screamed
at
them
and
the
cattle
drank
up
all
the
river
to
the
last
drop
and
baba
yaga
sitting
in
the
mortar
drove
it
with
the
pestle
and
swept
up
her
tracks
with
the
besom
and
flew
over
the
dry
bed
of
the
river
and
on
in
pursuit
of
the
little
girl
the
little
girl
put
her
ear
to
the
ground
and
listened
bang
bang
bangety
bang
she
could
hear
baba
yaga
beating
the
mortar
with
the
pestle
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
noise
and
there
was
baba
yaga
beating
with
the
pestle
and
sweeping
with
the
besom
coming
along
the
road
close
behind
the
little
girl
threw
down
the
comb
and
grew
bigger
and
bigger
and
its
teeth
sprouted
up
into
a
thick
forest
thicker
than
this
forest
where
we
live
so
thick
that
not
even
baba
yaga
could
force
her
way
through
and
baba
yaga
gnashing
her
teeth
and
screaming
with
rage
and
disappointment
turned
round
and
drove
away
home
to
her
little
hut
on
hen
legs
the
little
girl
ran
on
home
she
was
afraid
to
go
in
and
see
her
stepmother
so
she
ran
into
the
shed
scratch
scratch
out
came
the
little
mouse
so
you
got
away
all
right
my
dear
says
the
little
mouse
now
run
in
do
be
afraid
your
father
is
back
and
you
must
tell
him
all
about
it
the
little
girl
went
into
the
house
where
have
you
been
says
her
father
and
why
are
you
so
out
of
breath
the
stepmother
turned
yellow
when
she
saw
her
and
her
eyes
glowed
and
her
teeth
ground
together
until
they
broke
but
the
little
girl
was
not
afraid
and
she
went
to
her
father
and
climbed
on
his
knee
and
told
him
everything
just
as
it
had
happened
and
when
the
old
man
knew
that
the
stepmother
had
sent
his
little
daughter
to
be
eaten
by
baba
yaga
he
was
so
angry
that
he
drove
her
out
of
the
hut
and
ever
afterwards
lived
alone
with
the
little
girl
much
better
it
was
for
both
of
them
and
the
little
mouse
said
ivan
the
little
mouse
said
old
peter
came
and
lived
in
the
hut
and
every
day
it
used
to
sit
up
on
the
table
and
eat
crumbs
and
warm
its
paws
on
the
little
girl
glass
of
tea
tell
us
a
story
about
a
cat
please
grandfather
said
vanya
who
was
sitting
with
vladimir
curled
up
in
his
arms
the
story
of
a
very
happy
cat
said
maroosia
and
then
scratching
bayan
nose
she
added
and
afterwards
a
story
about
a
dog
i
tell
you
the
story
of
a
very
unhappy
cat
who
became
very
happy
said
old
peter
i
tell
you
the
story
of
the
cat
who
became
the
cat
who
became
if
you
drop
vladimir
by
mistake
you
know
he
always
falls
on
his
feet
and
if
vladimir
tumbles
off
the
roof
of
the
hut
he
always
falls
on
his
feet
cats
always
fall
on
their
feet
on
their
four
paws
and
never
hurt
themselves
and
as
in
tumbling
so
it
is
in
life
no
cat
is
ever
unfortunate
for
very
long
the
worse
things
look
for
a
cat
the
better
they
are
going
to
be
well
once
upon
a
time
not
so
very
long
ago
an
old
peasant
had
a
cat
and
did
not
like
him
he
was
a
always
fighting
and
he
had
lost
one
ear
and
was
not
very
pretty
to
look
at
the
peasant
thought
he
would
get
rid
of
his
old
cat
and
buy
a
new
one
from
a
neighbour
he
did
not
care
what
became
of
the
old
with
one
ear
so
long
as
he
never
saw
him
again
it
was
no
use
thinking
of
killing
him
for
it
is
a
life
work
to
kill
a
cat
and
it
likely
enough
that
the
cat
would
come
alive
at
the
end
so
the
old
peasant
he
took
a
sack
and
he
bundled
the
into
the
sack
and
he
sewed
up
the
sack
and
slung
it
over
his
back
and
walked
off
into
the
forest
off
he
went
trudging
along
in
the
summer
sunshine
deep
into
the
forest
and
when
he
had
gone
very
many
versts
into
the
forest
he
took
the
sack
with
the
cat
in
it
and
threw
it
away
among
the
trees
you
stay
there
says
he
and
if
you
do
get
out
in
this
desolate
place
much
good
may
it
do
you
old
quarrelsome
bundle
of
bones
and
fur
and
with
that
he
turned
round
and
trudged
home
again
and
bought
a
quiet
cat
from
a
neighbour
in
exchange
for
a
little
tobacco
and
settled
down
comfortably
at
home
with
the
new
cat
in
front
of
the
stove
and
there
he
may
be
to
this
day
so
far
as
i
know
my
story
does
not
bother
with
him
but
only
with
the
old
tied
up
in
the
sack
away
there
out
in
the
forest
the
bag
flew
through
the
air
and
plumped
down
through
a
bush
to
the
ground
and
the
old
landed
on
his
feet
inside
it
very
much
frightened
but
not
hurt
thinks
he
this
bag
this
flight
through
the
air
this
bump
mean
that
my
life
is
going
to
change
very
well
there
is
nothing
like
something
new
now
and
again
and
presently
he
began
tearing
at
the
bag
with
his
sharp
claws
soon
there
was
a
hole
he
could
put
a
paw
through
he
went
on
tearing
and
scratching
and
there
was
a
hole
he
could
put
two
paws
through
he
went
on
with
his
work
and
soon
he
could
put
his
head
through
all
the
easier
because
he
had
only
one
ear
a
minute
or
two
after
that
he
had
wriggled
out
of
the
bag
and
stood
up
on
his
four
paws
and
stretched
himself
in
the
forest
the
world
seems
to
be
larger
than
the
village
he
said
i
will
walk
on
and
see
what
there
is
in
it
he
washed
himself
all
over
curled
his
tail
proudly
up
in
the
air
cocked
the
only
ear
he
had
left
and
set
off
walking
under
the
forest
trees
i
was
the
in
the
village
says
he
to
himself
if
all
goes
well
i
shall
be
head
here
too
and
he
walked
along
as
if
he
were
the
tzar
himself
well
he
walked
on
and
on
and
he
came
to
an
old
hut
that
had
belonged
to
a
forester
there
was
nobody
there
nor
had
been
for
many
years
and
the
old
made
himself
quite
at
home
he
climbed
up
into
the
loft
under
the
roof
and
found
a
little
rotten
hay
a
very
good
bed
says
he
and
curls
up
and
falls
asleep
when
he
woke
he
felt
hungry
so
he
climbed
down
and
went
off
in
the
forest
to
catch
little
birds
and
mice
there
were
plenty
of
them
in
the
forest
and
when
he
had
eaten
enough
he
came
back
to
the
hut
climbed
into
the
loft
and
spent
the
night
there
very
comfortably
you
would
have
thought
he
would
be
content
not
he
he
was
a
cat
he
said
this
is
a
good
enough
lodging
but
i
have
to
catch
all
my
own
food
in
the
village
they
fed
me
every
day
and
i
only
caught
mice
for
fun
i
ought
to
be
able
to
live
like
that
here
a
person
of
my
dignity
ought
not
to
have
to
do
all
the
work
for
himself
next
day
he
went
walking
in
the
forest
and
as
he
was
walking
he
met
a
fox
a
vixen
a
very
pretty
young
thing
gay
and
giddy
like
all
girls
and
the
fox
saw
the
cat
and
was
very
much
astonished
all
these
years
she
said
for
though
she
was
young
she
thought
she
had
lived
a
long
time
all
these
years
she
said
i
lived
in
the
forest
but
i
never
seen
a
wild
beast
like
that
before
what
a
animal
and
with
only
one
ear
how
handsome
and
she
came
up
and
made
her
bows
to
the
cat
and
said
tell
me
great
lord
who
you
are
what
fortunate
chance
has
brought
you
to
this
forest
and
by
what
name
am
i
to
call
your
excellency
oh
the
fox
was
very
polite
it
is
not
every
day
that
you
meet
a
handsome
stranger
walking
in
the
forest
the
cat
arched
his
back
and
set
all
his
fur
on
end
and
said
very
slowly
and
quietly
i
have
been
sent
from
the
far
forests
of
siberia
to
be
over
you
and
my
name
is
cat
ivanovitch
o

ivanovitch
says
the
pretty
young
fox
and
she
makes
more
bows
i
did
not
know
i
beg
your
excellency
pardon
will
your
excellency
honour
my
humble
house
by
visiting
it

the
cat
and

do
they
call
you

name

ivanovna

lisabeta
says
the
cat
and
they
went
together
to
the
fox
earth
very
snug
very
neat
it
was
inside
and
the
cat
curled
himself
up
in
the
best
place
while
lisabeta
ivanovna
the
pretty
young
fox
made
ready
a
tasty
dish
of
game
and
while
she
was
making
the
meal
ready
and
dusting
the
furniture
with
her
tail
she
looked
at
the
cat
at
last
she
said
shyly

me

ivanovitch

or
single
single

the
cat
and
i
too

unmarried
says
the
pretty
young
fox
and
goes
busily
on
with
her
dusting
and
cooking
presently
she
looks
at
the
cat
again
what
if
we
were
to
marry
cat
ivanovitch

would
try
to
be
a
good
wife

the
cat

the
fox
went
to
her
store
and
took
out
all
the
dainties
that
she
had
and
made
a
wedding
feast
to
celebrate
her
marriage
to
the
great
cat
ivanovitch

only
one
ear
and

come
from

place
next
morning
the
pretty
young
fox
went
off
busily
into
the
forest
to
get
food
for
her
grand
husband
but
the
old
stayed
at
home
and
cleaned
his
whiskers
and
slept
he
was
a
lazy
one
was
that
cat
and
proud
the
fox
was
running
through
the
forest
looking
for
game
when
she
met
an
old
friend

handsome
young
wolf

he
began
making
polite
speeches

off
he
goes
to

the
pretty
young

went
idly
on
taking
the
air
for

knew
that

the
bear
shambled
off
as
fast
as
he
could
go
to
get
an
ox
the
pretty
young
fox
enjoying
the
fresh
air
of
the
forest
went
slowly
home
to
her
earth
and
crept
in
very
quietly
so
as
not
to
awake
the
great
cat
ivanovitch
who
had
only
one
ear
and
was
sleeping
in
the
best
place
presently
the
wolf
came
through
the
forest
dragging
a
sheep
he
had
killed
he
did
not
dare
to
go
too
near
the
fox
earth
because
of
cat
ivanovitch
the
new
so
he
stopped
well
out
of
sight
and
stripped
off
the
skin
of
the
sheep
and
arranged
the
sheep
so
as
to
seem
a
nice
tasty
morsel
then
he
stood
still
thinking
what
to
do
next
he
heard
a
noise
and
looked
up
there
was
the
bear
struggling
along
with
a
dead
ox
brother

as

were

a
little
hare
came
running
by
the
bear
saw
him
first
and
roared
out
hi

the

steps
at

time

his

says
the
wolf
do
forget
the
hare
ran
off
as
hard
as
he
could
go
glad
to
have
escaped
so
easily
meanwhile
the
wolf
and
the
bear
looked
about
for
good
places
in
which
to
hide
it
will
be
best
to
climb
trees
says
the
bear
i
shall
go
up
to
the
top
of
this
fir
but

bushes
says
the
bear
and
i
will
cover
you
with
the
dead
leaves
may
you
be
rewarded
says
the
wolf
and
he
crouched
down
under
the
bushes
and
the
bear
covered
him
up
with
dead
leaves
so
that
only
the
tip
of
his
nose
could
be
seen
then
the
bear
climbed
slowly
up
into
the
fir
tree
into
the
very
top
and
looked
out
to
see
if
the
fox
and
cat
ivanovitch
were
coming
they
were
coming
oh
yes
they
were
coming
the
hare
ran
up
and
knocked
on
the
door
and
said
to
the
fox
michael
ivanovitch
the
bear
and
his
brother
levon
ivanovitch
the
wolf
have
been
ready
for
a
long
time
and
have
brought
presents
of
a
sheep
and
an
ox
as
greetings
to
his
excellency
get
along
squinteye
says
the
fox
we
are
just
coming
and
so
the
fox
and
the
cat
set
out
together
the
bear
up
in
the
top
of
the
tree
saw
them
and
called
down
to
the
wolf
they
are
coming
brother
levon
they
are
coming
the
fox
and
her
husband
but
what
a
little
one
he
is
to
be
sure
quiet
quiet
whispers
the
wolf
he
hear
you
and
then
we
are
done
for
the
cat
came
up
and
arched
his
back
and
set
all
his
furs
on
end
and
threw
himself
on
the
ox
and
began
tearing
the
meat
with
his
teeth
and
claws
and
as
he
tore
he
purred
and
the
bear
listened
and
heard
the
purring
of
the
cat
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
cat
was
angrily
muttering
small
small
small
and
the
bear
whispers
he
no
giant
but
what
a
glutton
why
we
could
get
through
a
quarter
of
that
and
he
finds
it
not
enough
heaven
help
us
if
he
comes
after
us
the
wolf
tried
to
see
but
could
not
because
his
head
all
but
his
nose
was
covered
with
the
dry
leaves
little
by
little
he
moved
his
head
so
as
to
clear
the
leaves
away
from
in
front
of
his
eyes
try
as
he
would
to
be
quiet
the
leaves
rustled
so
little
ever
so
little
but
enough
to
be
heard
by
the
one
ear
of
the
cat
the
cat
stopped
tearing
the
meat
and
listened
i
have
caught
a
mouse
he
thought
once
more
the
leaves
rustled
the
cat
leapt
through
the
air
and
dropped
with
all
four
paws
and
his
claws
out
on
the
nose
of
the
wolf
how
the
wolf
yelped
the
leaves
flew
like
dust
and
the
wolf
leapt
up
and
ran
off
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
well
the
wolf
was
frightened
i
can
tell
you
but
he
was
not
so
frightened
as
the
cat
when
the
great
wolf
leapt
up
out
of
the
leaves
the
cat
screamed
and
ran
up
the
nearest
tree
and
that
was
the
tree
where
michael
ivanovitch
the
bear
was
hiding
in
the
topmost
branches
oh
he
has
seen
me
cat
ivanovitch
has
seen
me
thought
the
bear
he
had
no
time
to
climb
down
and
the
cat
was
coming
up
in
long
leaps
the
bear
trusted
to
providence
and
jumped
from
the
top
of
the
tree
many
were
the
branches
he
broke
as
he
fell
many
were
the
bones
he
broke
when
he
crashed
to
the
ground
he
picked
himself
up
and
stumbled
off
groaning
the
pretty
young
fox
sat
still
and
cried
out
run
run
brother
levon
quicker
on
your
pins
brother
michael
his
excellency
is
behind
you
his
excellency
is
close
behind
ever
since
then
all
the
wild
beasts
have
been
afraid
of
the
cat
and
the
cat
and
the
fox
live
merrily
together
and
eat
fresh
meat
all
the
year
round
which
the
other
animals
kill
for
them
and
leave
a
little
way
off
and
that
is
what
happened
to
the
old
with
one
eye
who
was
sewn
up
in
a
bag
and
thrown
away
in
the
forest
just
think
what
would
happen
to
our
handsome
vladimir
if
we
were
to
throw
him
away
said
vanya
spring
in
the
forest
warmer
the
sun
shone
and
warmer
yet
the
pines
were
green
now
all
the
snow
had
melted
off
them
drip
drip
the
falling
drops
of
water
making
tiny
wells
in
the
snow
under
the
trees
and
the
snow
under
the
trees
was
melting
too
much
had
gone
and
now
there
were
only
patches
of
snow
in
the
forest
like
scraps
of
a
big
white
blanket
shrinking
every
day
is
it
lucky
our
blankets
do
shrink
like
that
said
maroosia
old
peter
laughed
what
do
you
do
when
the
warm
weather
comes
he
asked
do
you
still
wear
sheepskin
coats
do
you
still
roll
up
at
night
under
the
rugs
no
said
maroosia
i
throw
the
rugs
off
and
put
my
fluffy
coat
away
till
next
winter
well
said
old
peter
and
god
the
father
of
us
all
he
does
for
the
earth
just
what
you
do
for
yourself
but
he
does
it
better
for
the
blankets
he
gives
the
earth
in
winter
get
smaller
and
smaller
as
the
warm
weather
comes
little
by
little
day
by
day
and
then
a
hard
frost
comes
grandfather
said
ivan
god
knows
all
about
that
little
one
said
old
peter
and
it
for
the
best
it
good
to
have
a
nip
or
two
in
the
spring
to
make
you
feel
alive
perhaps
it
his
way
of
telling
the
earth
to
wake
up
for
the
whole
earth
is
only
his
little
one
after
all
that
night
when
it
was
ivan
and
maroosia
consulted
together
and
when
old
peter
asked
what
the
story
was
to
be
they
were
ready
with
an
answer
the
snow
is
all
melting
away
said
ivan
the
summer
is
coming
said
maroosia
we
like
the
tale
of
the
little
snow
girl
said
ivan
little
daughter
of
the
snow
said
maroosia
old
peter
shook
out
his
pipe
and
closed
his
eyes
under
his
bushy
eyebrows
thinking
for
a
minute
then
he
began
the
little
daughter
of
the
snow
there
were
once
an
old
man
as
old
as
i
am
perhaps
and
an
old
woman
his
wife
and
they
lived
together
in
a
hut
in
a
village
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
there
were
many
people
in
the
village
quite
a
town
it
was
eight
huts
at
least
thirty
or
forty
souls
good
company
to
be
had
for
crossing
the
road
but
the
old
man
and
the
old
woman
were
unhappy
in
spite
of
living
like
that
in
the
very
middle
of
the
world
and
why
do
you
think
they
were
unhappy
they
were
unhappy
because
they
had
no
little
vanya
and
no
little
maroosia
think
of
that
some
would
say
they
were
better
off
without
them
would
you
say
that
grandfather
asked
maroosia
you
are
a
stupid
little
pigeon
said
old
peter
and
he
went
on
well
these
two
were
very
unhappy
all
the
other
huts
had
babies
in
them
yes
and
little
ones
playing
about
in
the
road
outside
and
having
to
be
shouted
at
when
any
one
came
driving
by
but
there
were
no
babies
in
their
hut
and
the
old
woman
never
had
to
go
to
the
door
to
see
where
her
little
one
had
strayed
to
because
she
had
no
little
one
and
these
two
the
old
man
and
the
old
woman
used
to
stand
whole
hours
just
peeping
through
their
window
to
watch
the
children
playing
outside
they
had
dogs
and
a
cat
and
cocks
and
hens
but
none
of
these
made
up
for
having
no
children
these
two
would
just
stand
and
watch
the
children
of
the
other
huts
the
dogs
would
bark
but
they
took
no
notice
and
the
cat
would
curl
up
against
them
but
they
never
felt
her
and
as
for
the
cocks
and
hens
well
they
were
fed
but
that
was
all
the
old
people
did
not
care
for
them
and
spent
all
their
time
in
watching
the
vanyas
and
maroosias
who
belonged
to
the
other
huts
in
the
winter
the
children
in
their
little
sheepskin
coats
like
ours
said
vanya
and
maroosia
together
like
yours
said
old
peter
in
their
little
sheepskin
coats
he
went
on
played
in
the
crisp
snow
they
pelted
each
other
with
snowballs
and
shouted
and
laughed
and
then
they
rolled
the
snow
together
and
made
a
snow
woman
a
regular
snow
baba
yaga
a
snow
witch
such
an
old
fright
and
the
old
man
watching
from
the
window
saw
this
and
he
says
to
the
old
woman
wife
let
us
go
into
the
yard
behind
and
make
a
little
snow
girl
and
perhaps
she
will
come
alive
and
be
a
little
daughter
to
us
husband
says
the
old
woman
there
no
knowing
what
may
be
let
us
go
into
the
yard
and
make
a
little
snow
girl
so
the
two
old
people
put
on
their
big
coats
and
their
fur
hats
and
went
out
into
the
yard
where
nobody
could
see
them
and
they
rolled
up
the
snow
and
began
to
make
a
little
snow
girl
very
very
tenderly
they
rolled
up
the
snow
to
make
her
little
arms
and
legs
the
good
god
helped
the
old
people
and
their
little
snow
girl
was
more
beautiful
than
ever
you
could
imagine
she
was
lovelier
than
a
birch
tree
in
spring
well
towards
evening
she
was
finished
a
little
girl
all
snow
with
blind
white
eyes
and
a
little
mouth
with
snow
lips
tightly
closed
oh
speak
to
us
says
the
old
man
wo
you
run
about
like
the
others
little
white
pigeon
says
the
old
woman
and
she
did
you
know
she
really
did
suddenly
in
the
twilight
they
saw
her
eyes
shining
blue
like
the
sky
on
a
clear
day
and
her
lips
flushed
and
opened
and
she
smiled
and
there
were
her
little
white
teeth
and
look
she
had
black
hair
and
it
stirred
in
the
wind
she
began
dancing
in
the
snow
like
a
little
white
spirit
tossing
her
long
hair
and
laughing
softly
to
herself
wildly
she
danced
like
snowflakes
whirled
in
the
wind
her
eyes
shone
and
her
hair
flew
round
her
and
she
sang
while
the
old
people
watched
and
wondered
and
thanked
god
this
is
what
she
sang
no
warm
blood
in
me
doth
glow
water
in
my
veins
doth
flow
yet
i
laugh
and
sing
and
play
by
frosty
night
and
frosty
day
little
daughter
of
the
snow
but
whenever
i
do
know
that
you
love
me
little
then
i
shall
melt
away
again
back
into
the
sky
i
go
little
daughter
of
the
snow
god
of
mine
is
she
beautiful
said
the
old
man
run
wife
and
fetch
a
blanket
to
wrap
her
in
while
you
make
clothes
for
her
the
old
woman
fetched
a
blanket
and
put
it
round
the
shoulders
of
the
little
snow
girl
and
the
old
man
picked
her
up
and
she
put
her
little
cold
arms
round
his
neck
you
must
not
keep
me
too
warm
she
said
well
they
took
her
into
the
hut
and
she
lay
on
a
bench
in
the
corner
farthest
from
the
stove
while
the
old
woman
made
her
a
little
coat
the
old
man
went
out
to
buy
a
fur
hat
and
boots
from
a
neighbour
for
the
little
girl
the
neighbour
laughed
at
the
old
man
but
a
rouble
is
a
rouble
everywhere
and
no
one
turns
it
from
the
door
and
so
he
sold
the
old
man
a
little
fur
hat
and
a
pair
of
little
red
boots
with
fur
round
the
tops
then
they
dressed
the
little
snow
girl
too
hot
too
hot
said
the
little
snow
girl
i
must
go
out
into
the
cool
night
but
you
must
go
to
sleep
now
said
the
old
woman
by
frosty
night
and
frosty
day
sang
the
little
girl
no
i
will
play
by
myself
in
the
yard
all
night
and
in
the
morning
i
play
in
the
road
with
the
children
nothing
the
old
people
said
could
change
her
mind
i
am
the
little
daughter
of
the
snow
she
replied
to
everything
and
she
ran
out
into
the
yard
into
the
snow
how
she
danced
and
ran
about
in
the
moonlight
on
the
white
frozen
snow
the
old
people
watched
her
and
watched
her
at
last
they
went
to
bed
but
more
than
once
the
old
man
got
up
in
the
night
to
make
sure
she
was
still
there
and
there
she
was
running
about
in
the
yard
chasing
her
shadow
in
the
moonlight
and
throwing
snowballs
at
the
stars
in
the
morning
she
came
in
laughing
to
have
breakfast
with
the
old
people
she
showed
them
how
to
make
porridge
for
her
and
that
was
very
simple
they
had
only
to
take
a
piece
of
ice
and
crush
it
up
in
a
little
wooden
bowl
then
after
breakfast
she
ran
out
in
the
road
to
join
the
other
children
and
the
old
people
watched
her
oh
proud
they
were
i
can
tell
you
to
see
a
little
girl
of
their
own
out
there
playing
in
the
road
they
fairly
longed
for
a
sledge
to
come
driving
by
so
that
they
could
run
out
into
the
road
and
call
to
the
little
snow
girl
to
be
careful
and
the
little
snow
girl
played
in
the
snow
with
the
other
children
how
she
played
she
could
run
faster
than
any
of
them
her
little
red
boots
flashed
as
she
ran
about
not
one
of
the
other
children
was
a
match
for
her
at
snowballing
and
when
the
children
began
making
a
snow
woman
a
baba
yaga
you
would
have
thought
the
little
daughter
of
the
snow
would
have
died
of
laughing
she
laughed
and
laughed
like
ringing
peals
on
little
glass
bells
but
she
helped
in
the
making
of
the
snow
woman
only
laughing
all
the
time
when
it
was
done
all
the
children
threw
snowballs
at
it
till
it
fell
to
pieces
and
the
little
snow
girl
laughed
and
laughed
and
was
so
quick
she
threw
more
snowballs
than
any
of
them
the
old
man
and
the
old
woman
watched
her
and
were
very
proud
she
is
all
our
own
said
the
old
woman
our
little
white
pigeon
said
the
old
man
in
the
evening
she
had
another
bowl
of
and
then
she
went
off
again
to
play
by
herself
in
the
yard
you
be
tired
my
dear
says
the
old
man
you
sleep
in
the
hut
wo
you
my
love
says
the
old
woman
after
running
about
all
day
long
but
the
little
daughter
of
the
snow
only
laughed
by
frosty
night
and
frosty
day
she
sang
and
ran
out
of
the
door
laughing
back
at
them
with
shining
eyes
and
so
it
went
on
all
through
the
winter
the
little
daughter
of
the
snow
was
singing
and
laughing
and
dancing
all
the
time
she
always
ran
out
into
the
night
and
played
by
herself
till
dawn
then
she
come
in
and
have
her
then
she
play
with
the
children
then
she
have
again
and
off
she
would
go
out
into
the
night
she
was
very
good
she
did
everything
the
old
woman
told
her
only
she
would
never
sleep
indoors
all
the
children
of
the
village
loved
her
they
did
not
know
how
they
had
ever
played
without
her
it
went
on
so
till
just
about
this
time
of
year
perhaps
it
was
a
little
earlier
anyhow
the
snow
was
melting
and
you
could
get
about
the
paths
often
the
children
went
together
a
little
way
into
the
forest
in
the
sunny
part
of
the
day
the
little
snow
girl
went
with
them
it
would
have
been
no
fun
without
her
and
then
one
day
they
went
too
far
into
the
wood
and
when
they
said
they
were
going
to
turn
back
little
snow
girl
tossed
her
head
under
her
little
fur
hat
and
ran
on
laughing
among
the
trees
the
other
children
were
afraid
to
follow
her
it
was
getting
dark
they
waited
as
long
as
they
dared
and
then
they
ran
home
holding
each
hands
and
there
was
the
little
daughter
of
the
snow
out
in
the
forest
alone
she
looked
back
for
the
others
and
could
not
see
them
she
climbed
up
into
a
tree
but
the
other
trees
were
thick
round
her
and
she
could
not
see
farther
than
when
she
was
on
the
ground
she
called
out
from
the
tree
ai
ai
little
friends
have
pity
on
the
little
snow
girl
an
old
brown
bear
heard
her
and
came
shambling
up
on
his
heavy
paws
what
are
you
crying
about
little
daughter
of
the
snow
o
big
bear
says
the
little
snow
girl
how
can
i
help
crying
i
have
lost
my
way
and
dusk
is
falling
and
all
my
little
friends

gone
i
will
take

says
the
old
brown
bear
o

says
the
little

girl
i
am
afraid
of
you
i
think
you
would
eat
me
i
would
rather
go
home
with
some
one
else
so
the
bear
shambled
away
and
left
her
an
old
gray
wolf
heard
her
and
came
galloping
up
on
his
swift
feet
he
stood
under
the
tree
and
asked
what
are
you
crying
about
little
daughter
of
the
snow
o
gray
wolf
says
the
little
snow
girl
how
can
i
help
crying
i
have
lost
my
way
and
it
is

and
all

the
old
gray

girl
i
am
afraid

you
i
think
you

i
would
rather
go
home
with
some
one
else
so
the
wolf
galloped
away
and
left
her
an
old
red
fox
heard
her
and
came
running
up
to
the
tree
on
his
little
pads
he
called
out
cheerfully
what
are
you
crying
about
little
daughter
of
the
snow
o
red
fox
says
the
little
snow
girl
how

way
and

the

i
do
not

i
will
go
home
with
you
if
you
will
take
me
so
she
scrambled
down
from
the
tree
and
she
held
the
fox
by
the
hair
of
his
back
and
they
ran
together
through
the
dark
forest
presently
they
saw
the
lights
in
the
windows
of
the
huts
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
at
the
door
of
the
hut
that
belonged
to
the
old
man
and
the
old
woman
and
there
were
the
old
man
and
the
old
woman
crying
and
lamenting
oh
what
has
become
of
our
little
snow
girl
oh
where
is
our
little
white
pigeon
here
i
am
says
the
little
snow
girl
the
kind
red
fox
has
brought
me
home
you
must
shut
up
the
dogs
the
old
man
shut
up
the
dogs

are
very
grateful
to
you
says
he

the
fox

the
old
red
fox
for
i
am
very
hungry
here

a
nice
crust
for
you
says
the
old
woman
oh
says
the
fox
but
what
i
would
like
would
be
a
nice
plump
hen
after
all
your
little
snow
girl
is
worth
a
nice
plump
hen
very
well
says
the
old
woman
but
she
grumbles
to
her
husband
husband
says
she
we
have
our
little
girl
again
we
have
says
he
thanks
be
for
that
it
seems
waste
to
give
away
a
good
plump
hen
it
does
says
he
well
i
was
thinking
says
the
old
woman
and
then
she
tells
him
what
she
meant
to
do
and
he
went
off
and
got
two
sacks
in
one
sack
they
put
a
fine
plump
hen
and
in
the
other
they
put
the
fiercest
of
the
dogs
they
took
the
bags
outside
and
called
to
the
fox
the
old
red
fox
came
up
to
them
licking
his
lips
because
he
was
so
hungry
they
opened
one
sack
and
out
the
hen
fluttered
the
old
red
fox
was
just
going
to
seize
her
when
they
opened
the
other
sack
and
out
jumped
the
fierce
dog
the
poor
fox
saw
his
eyes
flashing
in
the
dark
and
was
so
frightened
that
he
ran
all
the
way
back
into
the
deep
forest
and
never
had
the
hen
at
all
that
was
well
done
said
the
old
man
and
the
old
woman
we
have
got
our
little
snow
girl
and
not
had
to
give
away
our
plump
hen
then
they
heard
the
little
snow
girl
singing
in
the
hut
this
is
what
she
sang
old
ones
old
ones
now
i
know
less
you
love
me
than
a
hen
i
shall
go
away
again
ancient
ones
back
i
go
across
the
sky
to
my
motherkin
i
go
little
daughter
of
the
snow
they
ran
into
the
house
there
were
a
little
pool
of
water
in
front
of
the
stove
and
a
fur
hat
and
a
little
coat
and
little
red
boots
were
lying
in
it
and
yet
it
seemed
to
the
old
man
and
the
old
woman
that
they
saw
the
little
snow
girl
with
her
bright
eyes
and
her
long
hair
dancing
in
the
room
do
not
go
do
not
go
they
begged
and
already
they
could
hardly
see
the
little
dancing
girl
but
they
heard
her
laughing
and
they
heard
her
song
old
ones
old
ones
now
i
know
less
you
love
me
than
a
hen
i
shall
melt
away
again
to
my
motherkin
i
go
little
daughter
of
the
snow
and
just
then
the
door
blew
open
from
the
yard
and
a
cold
wind
filled
the
room
and
the
little
daughter
of
the
snow
was
gone
you
always
used
to
say
something
else
grandfather
said
maroosia
old
peter
patted
her
head
and
went
on
i
have
forgotten
the
little
snow
girl
leapt
into
the
arms
of
frost
her
father
and
snow
her
mother
and
they
carried
her
away
over
the
stars
to
the
far
north
and
there
she
plays
all
through
the
summer
on
the
frozen
seas
in
winter
she
comes
back
to
russia
and
some
day
you
know
when
you
are
making
a
snow
woman
you
may
find
the
little
daughter
of
the
snow
standing
there
instead
would
that
be
lovely
said
maroosia
vanya
thought
for
a
minute
and
then
he
said
i
love
her
much
more
than
a
hen
prince
ivan
the
witch
baby
and
the
little
sister
of
the
sun
once
upon
a
time
very
long
ago
there
was
a
little
prince
ivan
who
was
dumb
never
a
word
had
he
spoken
from
the
day
that
he
was
born
not
so
much
as
a
yes
or
a
no
or
a
please
or
a
thank
you
a
great
sorrow
he
was
to
his
father
because
he
could
not
speak
indeed
neither
his
father
nor
his
mother
could
bear
the
sight
of
him
for
they
thought
a
poor
sort
of
tzar
will
a
dumb
boy
make
they
even
prayed
and
said
if
only
we
could
have
another
child
whatever
it
is
like
it
could
be
no
worse
than
this
brat
who
can
not
say
a
word
and
for
that
wish
they
were
punished
as
you
shall
hear
and
they
took
no
sort
of
care
of
the
little
prince
ivan
and
he
spent
all
his
time
in
the
stables
listening
to
the
tales
of
an
old
groom
he
was
a
wise
man
was
the
old
groom
and
he
knew
the
past
and
the
future
and
what
was
happening
under
the
earth
maybe
he
had
learnt
his
wisdom
from
the
horses
anyway
he
knew
more
than
other
folk
and
there
came
a
day
when
he
said
to
prince
ivan
little
prince
says
he
you
have
a
sister
and
a
bad
one
at
that
she
has
come
because
of
your
father
prayers
and
your
wishes
a
witch
she
is
and
she
will
grow
like
a
seed
of
corn
in
six
weeks
she
be
a
grown
witch
and
with
her
iron
teeth
she
will
eat
up
your
father
and
eat
up
your
mother
and
eat
up
you
too
if
she
gets
the
chance
there
no
saving
the
old
people
but
if
you
are
quick
and
do
what
i
tell
you
you
may
escape
and
keep
your
soul
in
your
body
and
i
love
you
my
little
dumb
prince
and
do
not
wish
to
think
of
your
little
body
between
her
iron
teeth
you
must
go
to
your
father
and
ask
him
for
the
best
horse
he
has
and
then
gallop
like
the
wind
and
away
to
the
end
of
the
world
the
little
prince
ran
off
and
found
his
father
there
was
his
father
and
there
was
his
mother
and
a
little
baby
girl
was
in
his
arms
screaming
like
a
little
fury
well
she
not
dumb
said
his
father
as
if
he
were
well
pleased
father
says
the
little
prince
may
i
have
the
fastest
horse
in
the
stable
and
those
were
the
first
words
that
ever
left
his
mouth
what
says
his
father
have
you
got
a
voice
at
last
yes
take
whatever
horse
you
want
and
see
you
have
a
little
sister
a
fine
little
girl
she
is
too
she
has
teeth
already
it
a
pity
they
are
black
but
time
will
put
that
right
and
it
better
to
have
black
teeth
than
to
be
born
dumb
little
prince
ivan
shook
in
his
shoes
when
he
heard
of
the
black
teeth
of
his
little
sister
for
he
knew
that
they
were
iron
he
thanked
his
father
and
ran
off
to
the
stable
the
old
groom
saddled
the
finest
horse
there
was
such
a
horse
you
never
saw
black
it
was
and
its
saddle
and
bridle
were
trimmed
with
shining
silver
and
little
prince
ivan
climbed
up
and
sat
on
the
great
black
horse
and
waved
his
hand
to
the
old
groom
and
galloped
away
on
and
on
over
the
wide
world
it
a
big
place
this
world
thought
the
little
prince
i
wonder
when
i
shall
come
to
the
end
of
it
you
see
he
had
never
been
outside
the
palace
grounds
and
he
had
only
ridden
a
little
finnish
pony
and
now
he
sat
high
up
perched
on
the
back
of
the
great
black
horse
who
galloped
with
hoofs
that
thundered
beneath
him
and
leapt
over
rivers
and
streams
and
hillocks
and
anything
else
that
came
in
his
way
on
and
on
galloped
the
little
prince
on
the
great
black
horse
there
were
no
houses
anywhere
to
be
seen
it
was
a
long
time
since
they
had
passed
any
people
and
little
prince
ivan
began
to
feel
very
lonely
and
to
wonder
if
indeed
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
the
world
and
could
bring
his
journey
to
an
end
suddenly
on
a
wide
sandy
plain
he
saw
two
old
old
women
sitting
in
the
road
they
were
bent
double
over
their
work
sewing
and
sewing
and
now
one
and
now
the
other
broke
a
needle
and
took
a
new
one
out
of
a
box
between
them
and
threaded
the
needle
with
thread
from
another
box
and
went
on
sewing
and
sewing
their
old
noses
nearly
touched
their
knees
as
they
bent
over
their
work
little
prince
ivan
pulled
up
the
great
black
horse
in
a
cloud
of
dust
and
spoke
to
the
old
women
grandmothers
said
he
is
this
the
end
of
the
world
let
me
stay
here
and
live
with
you
and
be
safe
from
my
baby
sister
who
is
a
witch
and
has
iron
teeth
please
let
me
stay
with
you
and
i
be
very
little
trouble
and
thread
your
needles
for
you
when
you
break
them
prince
ivan
my
dear
said
one
of
the
old
women
this
is
not
the
end
of
the
world
and
little
good
would
it
be
to
you
to
stay
with
us
for
as
soon
as
we
have
broken
all
our
needles
and
used
up
all
our
thread
we
shall
die
and
then
where
would
you
be
your
sister
with
the
iron
teeth
would
have
you
in
a
minute
the
little
prince
cried
bitterly
for
he
was
very
little
and
all
alone
he
rode
on
further
over
the
wide
world
the
black
horse
galloping
and
galloping
and
throwing
the
dust
from
his
thundering
hoofs
he
came
into
a
forest
of
great
oaks
the
biggest
oak
trees
in
the
whole
world
and
in
that
forest
was
a
dreadful
noise
the
crashing
of
trees
falling
the
breaking
of
branches
and
the
whistling
of
things
hurled
through
the
air
the
prince
rode
on
and
there
before
him
was
the
huge
giant
hauling
the
great
oaks
out
of
the
ground
and
flinging
them
aside
like
weeds
i
should
be
safe
with
him
thought
little
prince
ivan
and
this
surely
must
be
the
end
of
the
world
he
rode
close
up
under
the
giant
and
stopped
the
black
horse
and
shouted
up
into
the
air
please
great
giant
says
he
is
this
the
end
of
the
world
and
may
i
live
with
you
and
be
safe
from
my
sister
who
is
a
witch
and
grows
like
a
seed
of
corn
and
has
iron
teeth
prince
ivan
my
dear
says
this
is
not
the
end
of
the
world
and
little
good
would
it
be
to
you
to
stay
with
me
for
as
soon
as
i
have
rooted
up
all
these
trees
i
shall
die
and
then
where
would
you
be
your
sister
would
have
you
in
a
minute
and
already
there
are
not
many
big
trees
left
and
the
giant
set
to
work
again
pulling
up
the
great
trees
and
throwing
them
aside
the
sky
was
full
of
flying
trees
little
prince
ivan
cried
bitterly
for
he
was
very
little
and
was
all
alone
he
rode
on
further
over
the
wide
world
the
black
horse
galloping
and
galloping
under
the
tall
trees
and
throwing
clods
of
earth
from
his
thundering
hoofs
he
came
among
the
mountains
and
there
was
a
roaring
and
a
crashing
in
the
mountains
as
if
the
earth
was
falling
to
pieces
one
after
another
whole
mountains
were
lifted
up
into
the
sky
and
flung
down
to
earth
so
that
they
broke
and
scattered
into
dust
and
the
big
black
horse
galloped
through
the
mountains
and
little
prince
ivan
sat
bravely
on
his
back
and
there
close
before
him
was
the
huge
giant
picking
up
the
mountains
like
pebbles
and
hurling
them
to
little
pieces
and
dust
upon
the
ground
this
must
be
the
end
of
the
world
thought
the
little
prince
and
at
any
rate
i
should
be
safe
with
him
please
great
giant
says
he
is
this
the
end
of
the
world
and
may
i
live
with
you
and
be
safe
from
my
sister
who
is
a
witch
and
has
iron
teeth
and
grows
like
a
seed
of
corn
prince
ivan
my
dear
says
resting
for
a
moment
and
dusting
the
rocks
off
his
great
hands
this
is
not
the
end
of
the
world
and
little
good
would
it
be
to
you
to
stay
with
me
for
as
soon
as
i
have
picked
up
all
these
mountains
and
thrown
them
down
again
i
shall
die
and
then
where
would
you
be
your
sister
would
have
you
in
a
minute
and
there
are
not
very
many
mountains
left
and
the
giant
set
to
work
again
lifting
up
the
great
mountains
and
hurling
them
away
the
sky
was
full
of
flying
mountains
little
prince
ivan
wept
bitterly
for
he
was
very
little
and
was
all
alone
he
rode
on
further
over
the
wide
world
the
black
horse
galloping
and
galloping
along
the
mountain
paths
and
throwing
the
stones
from
his
thundering
hoofs
at
last
he
came
to
the
end
of
the
world
and
there
hanging
in
the
sky
above
him
was
the
castle
of
the
little
sister
of
the
sun
beautiful
it
was
made
of
cloud
and
hanging
in
the
sky
as
if
it
were
built
of
red
roses
i
should
be
safe
up
there
thought
little
prince
ivan
and
just
then
the
sun
little
sister
opened
the
window
and
beckoned
to
him
prince
ivan
patted
the
big
black
horse
and
whispered
to
it
and
it
leapt
up
high
into
the
air
and
through
the
window
into
the
very
courtyard
of
the
castle
stay
here
and
play
with
me
said
the
little
sister
of
the
sun
and
prince
ivan
tumbled
off
the
big
black
horse
into
her
arms
and
laughed
because
he
was
so
happy
merry
and
pretty
was
the
sun
little
sister
and
she
was
very
kind
to
little
prince
ivan
they
played
games
together
and
when
she
was
tired
she
let
him
do
whatever
he
liked
and
run
about
her
castle
this
way
and
that
he
ran
about
the
battlements
of
rosy
cloud
hanging
in
the
sky
over
the
end
of
the
world
but
one
day
he
climbed
up
and
up
to
the
topmost
turret
of
the
castle
from
there
he
could
see
the
whole
world
and
far
far
away
beyond
the
mountains
beyond
the
forests
beyond
the
wide
plains
he
saw
his
father
palace
where
he
had
been
born
the
roof
of
the
palace
was
gone
and
the
walls
were
broken
and
crumbling
and
little
prince
ivan
came
slowly
down
from
the
turret
and
his
eyes
were
red
with
weeping
my
dear
says
the
sun
little
sister
why
are
your
eyes
so
red
it
is
the
wind
up
there
says
little
prince
ivan
and
the
sun
little
sister
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
of
the
castle
of
cloud
and
whispered
to
the
winds
not
to
blow
so
hard
but
next
day
little
prince
ivan
went
up
again
to
that
topmost
turret
and
looked
far
away
over
the
wide
world
to
the
ruined
palace
she
has
eaten
them
all
with
her
iron
teeth
he
said
to
himself
and
his
eyes
were
red
when
he
came
down
my
dear
says
the
sun
little
sister
your
eyes
are
red
again
it
is
the
wind
says
little
prince
ivan
and
the
sun
little
sister
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
and
scolded
the
wind
but
the
third
day
again
little
prince
ivan
climbed
up
the
stairs
of
cloud
to
that
topmost
turret
and
looked
far
away
to
the
broken
palace
where
his
father
and
mother
had
lived
and
he
came
down
from
the
turret
with
the
tears
running
down
his
face
why
you
are
crying
my
dear
says
the
sun
little
sister
tell
me
what
it
is
all
about
so
little
prince
ivan
told
the
little
sister
of
the
sun
how
his
sister
was
a
witch
and
how
he
wept
to
think
of
his
father
and
mother
and
how
he
had
seen
the
ruins
of
his
father
palace
far
away
and
how
he
could
not
stay
with
hen
happily
until
he
knew
how
it
was
with
his
parents
perhaps
it
is
not
yet
too
late
to
save
them
from
her
iron
teeth
though
the
old
groom
said
that
she
would
certainly
eat
them
and
that
it
was
the
will
of
god
but
let
me
ride
back
on
my
big
black
horse
do
not
leave
me
my
dear
says
the
sun
little
sister
i
am
lonely
here
by
myself
i
will
ride
back
on
my
big
black
horse
and
then
i
will
come
to
you
again
what
must
be
must
says
the
sun
little
sister
though
she
is
more
likely
to
eat
you
than
you
are
to
save
them
you
shall
go
but
you
must
take
with
you
a
magic
comb
a
magic
brush
and
two
apples
of
youth
these
apples
would
make
young
once
more
the
oldest
things
on
earth
then
she
kissed
little
prince
ivan
and
he
climbed
up
on
his
big
black
horse
and
leapt
out
of
the
window
of
the
castle
down
on
the
end
of
the
world
and
galloped
off
on
his
way
back
over
the
wide
world
he
came
to
the
giant
there
was
only
one
mountain
left
and
the
giant
was
just
picking
it
up
sadly
he
was
picking
it
up
for
he
knew
that
when
he
had
thrown
it
away
his
work
would
be
done
and
he
would
have
to
die
well
little
prince
ivan
says
this
is
the
end
and
he
heaves
up
the
mountain
but
before
he
could
toss
it
away
the
little
prince
threw
his
magic
brush
on
the
plain
and
the
brush
swelled
and
burst
and
there
were
range
upon
range
of
high
mountains
touching
the
sky
itself
why
says
i
have
enough
mountains
now
to
last
me
for
another
thousand
years
thank
you
kindly
little
prince
and
he
set
to
work
again
heaving
up
mountains
and
tossing
them
down
while
little
prince
ivan
galloped
on
across
the
wide
world
he
came
to
the
giant
there
were
only
two
of
the
great
oaks
left
and
the
giant
had
one
in
each
hand
ah
me
little
prince
ivan
says
my
life
is
come
to
its
end
for
i
have
only
to
pluck
up
these
two
trees
and
throw
them
down
and
then
i
shall
die
pluck
them
up
says
little
prince
ivan
here
are
plenty
more
for
you
and
he
threw
down
his
comb
there
was
a
noise
of
spreading
branches
of
swishing
leaves
of
opening
buds
all
together
and
there
before
them
was
a
forest
of
great
oaks
stretching
farther
than
the
giant
could
see
tall
though
he
was
why
says
here
are
enough
trees
to
last
me
for
another
thousand
years
thank
you
kindly
little
prince
and
he
set
to
work
again
pulling
up
the
big
trees
laughing
joyfully
and
hurling
them
over
his
head
while
little
prince
ivan
galloped
on
across
the
wide
world
he
came
to
the
two
old
women
they
were
crying
their
eyes
out
there
is
only
one
needle
left
says
the
first
there
is
only
one
bit
of
thread
in
the
box
sobs
the
second
and
then
we
shall
die
they
say
both
together
mumbling
with
their
old
mouths
before
you
use
the
needle
and
thread
just
eat
these
apples
says
little
prince
ivan
and
he
gives
them
the
two
apples
of
youth
the
two
old
women
took
the
apples
in
their
old
shaking
fingers
and
ate
them
bent
double
mumbling
with
their
old
lips
they
had
hardly
finished
their
last
mouthfuls
when
they
sat
up
straight
smiled
with
sweet
red
lips
and
looked
at
the
little
prince
with
shining
eyes
they
had
become
young
girls
again
and
their
gray
hair
was
black
as
the
raven
thank
you
kindly
little
prince
say
the
two
young
girls
you
must
take
with
you
the
handkerchief
we
have
been
sewing
all
these
years
throw
it
to
the
ground
and
it
will
turn
into
a
lake
of
water
perhaps
some
day
it
will
be
useful
to
you
thank
you
says
the
little
prince
and
off
he
gallops
on
and
on
over
the
wide
world
he
came
at
last
to
his
father
palace
the
roof
was
gone
and
there
were
holes
in
the
walls
he
left
his
horse
at
the
edge
of
the
garden
and
crept
up
to
the
ruined
palace
and
peeped
through
a
hole
inside
in
the
great
hall
was
sitting
a
huge
baby
girl
filling
the
whole
hall
there
was
no
room
for
her
to
move
she
had
knocked
off
the
roof
with
a
shake
of
her
head
and
she
sat
there
in
the
ruined
hall
sucking
her
thumb
and
while
prince
ivan
was
watching
through
the
hole
he
heard
her
mutter
to
herself
the
father
eaten
the
mother
and
now
to
eat
the
little
and
she
began
shrinking
getting
smaller
and
smaller
every
minute
little
prince
ivan
had
only
just
time
to
get
away
from
the
hole
in
the
wall
when
a
pretty
little
baby
girl
came
running
out
of
the
ruined
palace
you
must
be
my
little
brother
ivan
she
called
out
to
him
and
came
up
to
him
smiling
but
as
she
smiled
the
little
prince
saw
that
her
teeth
were
black
and
as
she
shut
her
mouth
he
heard
them
clink
together
like
pokers
come
in
says
she
and
she
took
little
prince
ivan
with
her
to
a
room
in
the
palace
all
broken
down
and
cobwebbed
there
was
a
dulcimer
lying
in
the
dust
on
the
floor
well
little
brother
says
the
witch
baby
you
play
on
the
dulcimer
and
amuse
yourself
while
i
get
supper
ready
but
do
stop
playing
or
i
shall
feel
lonely
and
she
ran
off
and
left
him
little
prince
ivan
sat
down
and
played
tunes
on
the
dulcimer
sad
enough
tunes
you
would
not
play
dance
music
if
you
thought
you
were
going
to
be
eaten
by
a
witch
but
while
he
was
playing
a
little
gray
mouse
came
out
of
a
crack
in
the
floor
some
people
think
that
this
was
the
wise
old
groom
who
had
turned
into
a
little
gray
mouse
to
save
ivan
from
the
witch
baby
ivan
ivan
says
the
little
gray
mouse
run
while
you
may
your
father
and
mother
were
eaten
long
ago
and
well
they
deserved
it
but
be
quick
or
you
will
be
eaten
too
your
pretty
little
sister
is
putting
an
edge
on
her
teeth
little
prince
ivan
thanked
the
mouse
and
ran
out
from
the
ruined
palace
and
climbed
up
on
the
back
of
his
big
black
horse
with
its
saddle
and
bridle
trimmed
with
silver
away
he
galloped
over
the
wide
world
the
witch
baby
stopped
her
work
and
listened
she
heard
the
music
of
the
dulcimer
so
she
made
sure
he
was
still
there
she
went
on
sharpening
her
teeth
with
a
file
and
growing
bigger
and
bigger
every
minute
and
all
the
time
the
music
of
the
dulcimer
sounded
among
the
ruins
as
soon
as
her
teeth
were
quite
sharp
she
rushed
off
to
eat
little
prince
ivan
she
tore
aside
the
walls
of
the
room
there
was
nobody
there
only
a
little
gray
mouse
running
and
jumping
this
way
and
that
on
the
strings
of
the
dulcimer
when
it
saw
the
witch
baby
the
little
mouse
ran
across
the
floor
and
into
the
crack
and
away
so
that
she
never
caught
it
how
the
witch
baby
gnashed
her
teeth
poker
and
tongs
poker
and
tongs
what
a
noise
they
made
she
swelled
up
bigger
and
bigger
till
she
was
a
baby
as
high
as
the
palace
and
then
she
jumped
up
so
that
the
palace
fell
to
pieces
about
her
then
off
she
ran
after
little
prince
ivan
little
prince
ivan
on
the
big
black
horse
heard
a
noise
behind
him
he
looked
back
and
there
was
the
huge
witch
towering
over
the
trees
she
was
dressed
like
a
little
baby
and
her
eyes
flashed
and
her
teeth
clanged
as
she
shut
her
mouth
she
was
running
with
long
strides
faster
even
than
the
black
horse
could
gallop
and
he
was
the
best
horse
in
all
the
world
little
prince
ivan
threw
down
the
handkerchief
that
had
been
sewn
by
the
two
old
women
who
had
eaten
the
apples
of
youth
it
turned
into
a
deep
broad
lake
so
that
the
witch
baby
had
to
swim
and
swimming
is
slower
than
running
it
took
her
a
long
time
to
get
across
and
all
that
time
prince
ivan
was
galloping
on
never
stopping
for
a
moment
the
witch
baby
crossed
the
lake
and
came
thundering
after
him
close
behind
she
was
and
would
have
caught
him
but
the
giant
saw
the
little
prince
galloping
on
the
big
black
horse
and
the
witch
baby
tearing
after
him
he
pulled
up
the
great
oaks
in
armfuls
and
threw
them
down
just
in
front
of
the
witch
baby
he
made
a
huge
pile
of
the
big
trees
and
the
witch
baby
had
to
stop
and
gnaw
her
way
through
them
with
her
iron
teeth
it
took
her
a
long
time
to
gnaw
through
the
trees
and
the
black
horse
galloped
and
galloped
ahead
but
presently
prince
ivan
heard
a
noise
behind
him
he
looked
back
and
there
was
the
witch
baby
thirty
feet
high
racing
after
him
clanging
with
her
teeth
close
behind
she
was
and
the
little
prince
sat
firm
on
the
big
black
horse
and
galloped
and
galloped
but
she
would
have
caught
him
if
the
giant
had
not
seen
the
little
prince
on
the
big
black
horse
and
the
great
witch
baby
running
after
him
the
giant
tore
up
the
biggest
mountain
in
the
world
and
flung
it
down
in
front
of
her
and
another
on
the
top
of
that
she
had
to
bite
her
way
through
them
while
the
little
prince
galloped
and
galloped
at
last
little
prince
ivan
saw
the
cloud
castle
of
the
little
sister
of
the
sun
hanging
over
the
end
of
the
world
and
gleaming
in
the
sky
as
if
it
were
made
of
roses
he
shouted
with
hope
and
the
black
horse
shook
his
head
proudly
and
galloped
on
the
witch
baby
thundered
after
him
nearer
she
came
and
nearer
ah
little
one
screams
the
witch
baby
you
sha
get
away
this
time
the
sun
little
sister
was
looking
from
a
window
of
the
castle
in
the
sky
and
she
saw
the
witch
baby
stretching
out
to
grab
little
prince
ivan
she
flung
the
window
open
and
just
in
time
the
big
black
horse
leapt
up
and
through
the
window
and
into
the
courtyard
with
little
prince
ivan
safe
on
its
back
how
the
witch
baby
gnashed
her
iron
teeth
give
him
up
she
screams
i
will
not
says
the
sun
little
sister
see
you
here
says
the
witch
baby
and
she
makes
herself
smaller
and
smaller
and
smaller
till
she
was
just
like
a
real
little
girl
let
us
be
weighed
in
the
great
scales
and
if
i
am
heavier
than
prince
ivan
i
can
take
him
and
if
he
is
heavier
than
i
am
i
say
no
more
about
it
the
sun
little
sister
laughed
at
the
witch
baby
and
teased
her
and
she
hung
the
great
scales
out
of
the
cloud
castle
so
that
they
swung
above
the
end
of
the
world
little
prince
ivan
got
into
one
scale
and
down
it
went
now
says
the
witch
baby
we
shall
see
and
she
made
herself
bigger
and
bigger
and
bigger
till
she
was
as
big
as
she
had
been
when
she
sat
and
sucked
her
thumb
in
the
hall
of
the
ruined
palace
i
am
the
heavier
she
shouted
and
gnashed
her
iron
teeth
then
she
jumped
into
the
other
scale
she
was
so
heavy
that
the
scale
with
the
little
prince
in
it
shot
up
into
the
air
it
shot
up
so
fast
that
little
prince
ivan
flew
up
into
the
sky
up
and
up
and
up
and
came
down
on
the
topmost
turret
of
the
cloud
castle
of
the
little
sister
of
the
sun
the
sun
little
sister
laughed
and
closed
the
window
and
went
up
to
the
turret
to
meet
the
little
prince
but
the
witch
baby
turned
back
the
way
she
had
come
and
went
off
gnashing
her
iron
teeth
until
they
broke
and
ever
since
then
little
prince
ivan
and
the
little
sister
of
the
sun
play
together
in
the
castle
of
cloud
that
hangs
over
the
end
of
the
world
they
borrow
the
stars
to
play
at
ball
and
put
them
back
at
night
whenever
they
remember
so
when
there
are
no
stars
asked
maroosia
it
means
that
prince
ivan
and
the
sun
little
sister
have
gone
to
sleep
over
their
games
and
forgotten
to
put
their
toys
away
the
stolen
turnips
the
magic
tablecloth
the
sneezing
goat
and
the
wooden
whistle
this
is
the
story
which
old
peter
used
to
tell
whenever
either
vanya
or
maroosia
was
cross
this
did
not
often
happen
but
it
would
be
no
use
to
pretend
that
it
never
happened
at
all
sometimes
it
was
vanya
who
scolded
maroosia
and
sometimes
it
was
maroosia
who
scolded
vanya
sometimes
there
were
two
scoldings
going
on
at
once
and
old
peter
did
not
like
crossness
in
the
hut
whoever
did
the
scolding
he
said
it
spoilt
his
tobacco
and
put
a
sour
taste
in
the
tea
and
of
course
when
the
children
remembered
that
they
were
spoiling
their
grandfather
tea
and
tobacco
they
stopped
just
as
quickly
as
they
could
unless
their
tongues
had
run
right
away
with
them
which
happens
sometimes
you
know
even
to
people
this
story
used
to
be
told
in
two
ways
it
was
either
the
tale
of
an
old
man
who
was
bothered
by
a
cross
old
woman
or
the
tale
of
an
old
woman
who
was
bothered
by
a
cross
old
man
and
the
moment
old
peter
began
the
story
both
children
would
ask
at
once
which
is
the
cross
one
for
t
hen
they
would
know
which
of
them
old
peter
thought
was
in
the
wrong
this
time
it
the
old
woman
said
their
grandfather
but
as
like
as
not
it
will
be
the
old
man
next
and
then
any
quarrelling
there
was
came
to
an
end
and
was
forgotten
before
the
end
of
the
story
this
is
the
story
an
old
man
and
an
old
woman
lived
in
a
little
wooden
house
all
round
the
house
there
was
a
garden
crammed
with
flowers
and
potatoes
and
beetroots
and
cabbages
and
in
one
corner
of
the
house
there
was
a
narrow
wooden
stairway
which
went
up
and
up
twisting
and
twisting
into
a
high
tower
in
the
top
of
the
tower
was
a
dovecot
and
on
the
top
of
the
dovecot
was
a
flat
roof
now
the
old
woman
was
never
content
with
the
doings
of
the
old
man
she
scolded
all
day
and
she
scolded
all
night
if
there
was
too
much
rain
it
was
the
old
man
fault
and
if
there
was
a
drought
and
all
green
things
were
parched
for
lack
of
water
well
the
old
man
was
to
blame
for
not
altering
the
weather
and
though
he
was
old
and
tired
it
was
all
the
same
to
her
how
much
work
she
put
on
his
shoulders
the
garden
was
full
there
was
no
room
in
it
at
all
not
even
for
a
single
pea
and
all
of
a
sudden
the
old
woman
sets
her
heart
on
growing
turnips
but
there
is
no
room
in
the
garden
says
the
old
man
sow
them
on
the
top
of
the
dovecot
says
the
old
woman
but
there
is
no
earth
there
carry
earth
up
and
put
it
there
says
she
so
the
old
man
laboured
up
and
down
with
his
tired
old
bones
and
covered
the
top
of
the
dovecot
with
good
black
earth
he
could
only
take
up
a
very
little
at
a
time
because
he
was
old
and
weak
and
because
the
stairs
were
so
narrow
and
dangerous
that
he
had
to
hold
on
with
both
hands
and
carry
the
earth
in
a
bag
which
he
held
in
his
teeth
his
teeth
were
strong
enough
because
he
had
been
biting
crusts
all
his
life
the
old
woman
left
him
nothing
else
for
she
took
all
the
crumb
for
herself
the
old
man
did
his
best
and
by
evening
the
top
of
the
dovecot
was
covered
with
earth
and
he
had
sown
it
with
turnip
seed
next
day
and
the
day
after
that
and
every
day
the
old
woman
scolded
the
old
man
till
he
went
up
to
the
dovecot
to
see
how
those
turnip
seeds
were
getting
on
are
they
ready
to
eat
yet
they
are
not
ready
to
eat
is
the
green
sprouting
the
green
is
sprouting
and
at
last
there
came
a
day
when
the
old
man
came
down
from
the
dovecot
and
said
the
turnips
are
doing
finely
quite
big
they
are
getting
but
all
the
best
ones
have
been
stolen
away
stolen
away
cried
the
old
woman
shaking
with
rage
and
have
you
lived
all
these
years
and
not
learned
how
to
keep
thieves
from
a
turnip
bed
on
the
top
of
a
dovecot
on
the
top
of
a
tower
on
the
top
of
a
house
out
with
you
and
do
you
dare
to
come
back
till
you
have
caught
the
thieves
the
old
man
did
not
dare
to
tell
her
that
the
door
had
been
bolted
although
he
knew
it
had
because
he
had
bolted
it
himself
he
hurried
away
out
of
the
house
more
because
he
wanted
to
get
out
of
earshot
of
her
scolding
than
because
he
had
any
hope
of
finding
the
thieves
they
may
be
birds
thinks
he
or
the
little
brown
squirrels
who
else
could
climb
so
high
without
using
the
stairs
and
how
is
an
old
man
like
me
to
get
hold
of
them
flying
through
the
tops
of
the
high
trees
and
running
up
and
down
the
branches
and
so
he
wandered
away
without
his
dinner
into
the
deep
forest
but
god
is
good
to
old
men
has
he
given
me
two
little
pigeons
who
nearly
always
are
as
merry
as
all
little
pigeons
should
be
and
god
led
the
old
man
through
the
forest
though
the
old
man
thought
he
was
just
wandering
on
trying
to
lose
himself
and
forget
the
scolding
voice
of
the
old
woman
and
after
he
had
walked
a
long
way
through
the
dark
green
forest
he
saw
a
little
hut
standing
under
the
pine
trees
there
was
no
smoke
coming
from
the
chimney
but
there
was
such
a
chattering
in
the
hut
you
could
hear
it
far
away
it
was
like
coming
near
a
rookery
at
evening
or
disturbing
a
lot
of
starlings
and
as
the
old
man
came
slowly
nearer
to
the
hut
he
thought
he
saw
little
faces
looking
at
him
through
the
window
and
peeping
through
the
door
he
could
not
be
sure
because
they
were
gone
so
quickly
and
all
the
time
the
chattering
went
on
louder
and
louder
till
the
old
man
nearly
put
his
hands
to
his
ears
and
then
suddenly
the
chattering
stopped
there
was
not
a
sound
no
noise
at
all
the
old
man
stood
still
a
squirrel
dropped
a
fir
cone
close
by
and
the
old
man
was
startled
by
the
fall
of
it
because
everything
else
was
so
quiet
whatever
there
is
in
the
hut
it
wo
be
worse
than
the
old
woman
says
the
old
man
to
himself
so
he
makes
the
sign
of
the
holy
cross
and
steps
up
to
the
little
hut
and
takes
a
look
through
the
door
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
you
would
have
thought
the
hut
was
empty
the
old
man
took
a
step
inside
bending
under
the
little
low
door
still
he
could
see
nobody
only
a
great
heap
of
rags
and
blankets
on
the
on
the
top
of
the
stove
the
hut
was
as
clean
as
if
it
had
only
that
minute
been
swept
by
maroosia
herself
but
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
there
was
a
scrap
of
green
leaf
lying
and
the
old
man
knew
in
a
moment
that
it
was
a
scrap
of
green
leaf
from
the
top
of
a
young
turnip
and
while
the
old
man
looked
at
it
the
heap
of
blankets
and
rugs
on
the
stove
moved
first
in
one
place
and
then
in
another
then
there
was
a
little
laugh
then
another
and
suddenly
there
was
a
great
stir
in
the
blankets
and
they
were
all
thrown
back
and
there
were
dozens
and
dozens
of
little
queer
children
laughing
and
laughing
and
laughing
and
looking
at
the
old
man
and
every
child
had
a
little
turnip
and
showed
it
to
the
old
man
and
laughed
just
then
the
door
of
the
stove
flew
open
and
out
tumbled
more
of
the
little
queer
children
dozens
and
dozens
of
them
the
more
they
came
tumbling
out
into
the
hut
the
more
there
seemed
to
be
chattering
in
the
stove
and
squeezing
to
get
out
one
over
the
top
of
another
the
noise
of
chattering
and
laughing
would
have
made
your
head
spin
and
everyone
of
the
children
out
of
the
stove
had
a
little
turnip
like
the
others
and
waved
it
about
and
showed
it
to
the
old
man
and
laughed
like
anything
ho
says
the
old
man
so
you
are
the
thieves
who
have
stolen
the
turnips
from
the
top
of
the
dovecot
yes
cried
the
children
and
the
chatter
rattled
as
fast
as
hailstones
on
the
roof
yes
yes
yes
stole
the
turnips
how
did
you
get
on
to
the
top
of
the
dovecot
when
the
door
into
the
house
was
bolted
and
fast
at
that
the
children
all
burst
out
laughing
and
did
not
answer
a
word
laugh
you
may
said
the
old
man
but
it
is
i
who
get
the
scolding
when
the
turnips
fly
away
in
the
night
never
mind
never
mind
cried
the
children
we
pay
for
the
turnips
how
can
you
pay
for
them
asks
the
old
man
you
have
got
nothing
to
pay
with
all
the
children
chattered
together
and
looked
at
the
old
man
and
smiled
then
one
of
them
said
to
the
old
man
are
you
hungry
grandfather
hungry
says
the
old
man
why
yes
of
course
i
am
my
dear
been
looking
for
you
all
day
and
i
had
to
start
without
my
dinner
if
you
are
hungry
open
the
cupboard
behind
you
the
old
man
opened
the
cupboard
take
out
the
tablecloth
the
old
man
took
out
the
tablecloth
spread
it
on
the
table
the
old
man
spread
the
tablecloth
on
the
table
now
shouted
the
children
chattering
like
a
thousand
nests
full
of
young
birds
we
all
sit
down
and
have
dinner
they
pulled
out
the
benches
and
gave
the
old
man
a
chair
at
one
end
and
all
crowded
round
the
table
ready
to
begin
but
there
no
food
said
the
old
man
how
they
laughed
grandfather
one
of
them
sings
out
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
you
just
tell
the
tablecloth
to
turn
inside
out
how
says
he
tell
the
tablecloth
to
turn
inside
out
that
easy
enough
there
no
harm
in
doing
that
thinks
the
old
man
so
he
says
to
the
tablecloth
as
firmly
as
he
could
now
then
you
tablecloth
turn
inside
out
the
tablecloth
hove
itself
up
into
the
air
and
rolled
itself
this
way
and
that
as
if
it
were
in
a
whirlwind
and
then
suddenly
laid
itself
flat
on
the
table
again
and
somehow
or
other
it
had
covered
itself
with
dishes
and
plates
and
wooden
spoons
with
pictures
on
them
and
bowls
of
soup
and
mushrooms
and
kasha
and
meat
and
cakes
and
fish
and
ducks
and
everything
else
you
could
think
of
ready
for
the
best
dinner
in
the
world
the
chattering
and
laughing
stopped
and
the
old
man
and
those
dozens
and
dozens
of
little
queer
children
set
to
work
and
ate
everything
on
the
table
which
of
you
washes
the
dishes
asked
the
old
man
when
they
had
all
done
the
children
laughed
tell
the
tablecloth
to
turn
outside
in
tablecloth
says
the
old
man
turn
outside
in
up
jumped
the
tablecloth
with
all
the
empty
dishes
and
dirty
plates
and
spoons
whirled
itself
this
way
and
that
in
the
air
and
suddenly
spread
itself
out
flat
again
on
the
table
as
clean
and
white
as
when
it
was
taken
out
of
the
cupboard
there
was
not
a
dish
or
a
bowl
or
a
spoon
or
a
plate
or
a
knife
to
be
seen
no
not
even
a
crumb
that
a
good
tablecloth
says
the
old
man
see
here
grandfather
shouted
the
children
you
take
the
tablecloth
along
with
you
and
say
no
more
about
those
turnips
well
i
content
with
that
says
the
old
man
and
he
folded
up
the
tablecloth
very
carefully
and
put
it
away
inside
his
shirt
and
said
he
must
be
going
says
he
and
thank
you
for
the
dinner
and
the
tablecloth
say
they
and
thank
you
for
the
turnips
the
old
man
made
his
way
home
singing
through
the
forest
in
his
creaky
old
voice
until
he
came
near
the
little
wooden
house
where
he
lived
with
the
old
woman
as
soon
as
he
came
near
there
he
slipped
along
like
any
mouse
and
as
soon
as
he
put
his
head
inside
the
door
the
old
woman
began
have
you
found
the
thieves
you
old
fool
i
found
the
thieves
who
were
they
they
were
a
whole
crowd
of
little
queer
children
have
you
given
them
a
beating
they
remember

have
not

them
to

and
i
teach

turnips
i
have
got
them
what
have
you
done
with
them
i
had
dinner
with
them
well
at
that
the
old
woman
flew
into
such
a
rage
she
could
hardly
speak
but
speak
she
did
yes
and
shout
too
and
scream
and
it
was
all
the
old
man
could
do
not
to
run
away
out
of
the
cottage
but
he
stood
still
and
listened
and
thought
of
something
else
and
when
she
had
done
he
said
they
paid
for
the
turnips
paid
for
the
turnips
scolded
the
old
woman
a
lot
of
children
what
did
they
give
you
mushrooms
we
can
get
them
without
losing
our
turnips
they
gave
me
a
tablecloth
said
the
old
man
it
a
very
good
tablecloth
he
pulled
it
out
of
his
shirt
and
spread
it
on
the
table
and
as
quickly
as
he
could
before
she
began
again
he
said
tablecloth
turn
inside
out
the
old
woman
stopped
short
just
when
she
was
taking
breath
to
scold
with
when
the
tablecloth
jumped
up
and
danced
in
the
air
and
settled
on
the
table
again
covered
with
things
to
eat
and
to
drink
she
smelt
the
meat
took
a
spoonful
of
the
soup
and
tried
all
the
other
dishes
look
at
all
the
washing
up
it
will
mean
says
she
tablecloth
turn
outside
in
says
the
old
man
and
there
was
a
whirl
of
white
cloth
and
dishes
and
everything
else
and
then
the
tablecloth
spread
itself
out
on
the
table
as
clean
as
ever
you
could
wish
that
not
a
bad
tablecloth
says
the
old
woman
but
of
course
they
owed
me
something
for
stealing
all
those
turnips
the
old
man
said
nothing
he
was
very
tired
and
he
just
laid
down
and
went
to
sleep
as
soon
as
he
was
asleep
the
old
woman
took
the
tablecloth
and
hid
it
away
in
an
iron
chest
and
put
a
tablecloth
of
her
own
in
its
place
they
were
my
turnips
says
she
and
i
do
see
why
he
should
have
a
share
in
the
tablecloth
he
had
a
meal
from
it
once
at
my
expense
and
once
is
enough
then
she
lay
down
and
went
to
sleep
grumbling
to
herself
even
in
her
dreams
early
in
the
morning
the
old
woman
woke
the
old
man
and
told
him
to
go
up
to
the
dovecot
and
see
how
those
turnips
were
getting
on
he
got
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes
when
he
saw
the
tablecloth
on
the
table
the
wish
came
to
him
to
have
a
bite
of
food
to
begin
the
day
with
so
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
putting
on
his
shirt
and
called
to
the
tablecloth
tablecloth
turn
inside
out
nothing
happened
why
should
anything
happen
it
was
not
the
same
tablecloth
the
old
man
told
the
old
woman
you
should
have
made
a
good
feast
yesterday
says
he
for
the
tablecloth
is
no
good
any
more
that
is
it
no
good
that
way
it
like
any
ordinary
tablecloth
most
tablecloths
are
says
the
old
woman
but
what
are
you
dawdling
about
up
you
go
and
have
a
look
at
those
turnips
the
old
man
went
climbing
up
the
narrow
twisting
stairs
he
held
on
with
both
hands
for
fear
of
falling
because
they
were
so
steep
he
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
house
to
the
top
of
the
tower
to
the
top
of
the
dovecot
and
looked
at
the
turnips
he
looked
at
the
turnips
and
he
counted
the
turnips
and
then
he
came
slowly
down
the
stairs
again
wondering
what
the
old
woman
would
say
to
him
well
says
the
old
woman
in
her
sharp
voice
are
they
doing
nicely
because
if
not
i
know
whose
fault
it
is
they
are
doing
finely
said
the
old
man
but
some
of
them
have
gone
indeed
quite
a
lot
of
them
have
been
stolen
away
stolen
away
screamed
the
old
woman
how
dare
you
stand
there
and
tell
me
that
did
you
find
the
thieves
yesterday
go
and
find
those
children
again
and
take
a
stick
with
you
and
do
show
yourself
here
till
you
can
tell
me
that
they
wo
steal
again
in
a
hurry
let
me
have
a
bite
to
eat
begs
the
old
man
it
a
long
way
to
go
on
an
empty
stomach
not
a
mouthful
yells
the
old
woman
off
with
you
letting
my
turnips
be
stolen
every
night
and
then
talking
to
me
about
bites
of
food
so
the
old
man
went
off
again
without
his
dinner
and
hobbled
away
into
the
forest
as
quickly
as
he
could
to
get
out
of
earshot
of
the
old
woman
scolding
tongue
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
sight
the
old
woman
stopped
screaming
after
him
and
went
into
the
house
and
opened
the
iron
chest
and
took
out
the
tablecloth
the
children
had
given
the
old
man
and
laid
it
on
the
table
instead
of
her
own
she
told
it
to
turn
inside
out
and
up
it
flew
and
whirled
about
and
flopped
down
flat
again
all
covered
with
good
things
she
ate
as
much
as
she
could
hold
then
she
told
the
tablecloth
to
turn
outside
in
and
folded
it
up
and
hid
it
away
again
in
the
iron
chest
meanwhile
the
old
man
tightened
his
belt
because
he
was
so
hungry
he
hobbled
along
through
the
green
forest
till
he
came
to
the
little
hut
standing
under
the
pine
trees
there
was
no
smoke
coming
from
the
chimney
but
there
was
such
a
chattering
you
would
have
thought
that
all
the
vanyas
and
maroosias
in
holy
russia
were
talking
to
each
other
inside
he
had
no
sooner
come
in
sight
of
the
hut
than
the
dozens
and
dozens
of
little
queer
children
came
pouring
out
of
the
door
to
meet
him
and
every
single
one
of
them
had
a
turnip
and
showed
it
to
the
old
man
and
laughed
and
laughed
as
if
it
were
the
best
joke
in
the
world
i
knew
it
was
you
said
the
old
man
of
course
it
was
us
cried
the
children
stole
the
turnips
but
how
did
you
get
to
the
top
of
the
dovecot
when
the
door
into
the
house
was
bolted
and
fast
the
children
laughed
and
laughed
and
did
not
answer
a
word
laugh
you
may
says
the
old
man
but
it
is
i
who
get
the
scolding
when
the
turnips
fly
away
in
the
night
never
mind
never
mind
cried
the
children
we
pay
for
the
turnips
all
very
well
says
the
old
man
but
that
tablecloth
of
yours
it
was
fine
yesterday
but
this
morning
it
would
not
give
me
even
a
glass
of
tea
and
a
hunk
of
black
bread
at
that
the
faces
of
the
little
queer
children
were
troubled
and
grave
for
a
moment
or
two
they
all
chattered
together
and
took
no
notice
of
the
old
man
then
one
of
them
said
well
this
time
we
give
you
something
better
we
give
you
a
goat
a
goat
says
the
old
man
a
goat
with
a
cold
in
its
head
said
the
children
and
they
crowded
round
him
and
took
him
behind
the
hut
where
there
was
a
gray
goat
with
a
long
beard
cropping
the
short
grass
it
a
good
enough
goat
says
the
old
man
i
do
see
anything
wrong
with
him
it
better
than
that
cried
the
children
you
tell
it
to
sneeze
the
old
man
thought
the
children
might
be
laughing
at
him
but
he
did
not
care
and
he
remembered
the
tablecloth
so
he
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
to
the
goat
sneeze
goat
says
he
and
instantly
the
goat
started
sneezing
as
if
it
would
shake
itself
to
pieces
and
as
it
sneezed
good
gold
pieces
flew
from
it
in
all
directions
till
the
ground
was
thick
with
them
that
enough
said
the
children
hurriedly
tell
him
to
stop
for
all
this
gold
is
no
use
to
us
and
it
such
a
bother
having
to
sweep
it
away
stop
sneezing
goat
says
the
old
man
and
the
goat
stopped
sneezing
and
stood
there
panting
and
out
of
breath
in
the
middle
of
the
sea
of
gold
pieces
the
children
began
kicking
the
gold
pieces
about
spreading
them
by
walking
through
them
as
if
they
were
dead
leaves
my
old
father
used
to
say
that
those
gold
pieces
are
lying
about
still
for
anybody
to
pick
up
but
i
doubt
if
he
knew
just
where
to
look
for
them
or
he
would
have
had
better
clothes
on
his
back
and
a
little
more
food
on
the
table
but
who
knows
some
day
we
may
come
upon
that
little
hut
somewhere
in
the
forest
and
then
we
shall
know
what
to
look
for
the
children
laughed
and
chattered
and
kicked
the
gold
pieces
this
way
and
that
into
the
green
bushes
then
they
brought
the
old
man
into
the
hut
and
gave
him
a
bowl
of
kasha
to
eat
because
he
had
had
no
dinner
there
was
no
magic
about
the
kasha
but
it
was
good
enough
kasha
for
all
that
and
hunger
made
it
better
when
the
old
man
had
finished
the
kasha
and
drunk
a
glass
of
tea
and
smoked
a
little
pipe
he
got
up
and
made
a
low
bow
and
thanked
the
children
and
the
children
tied
a
rope
to
the
goat
and
sent
the
old
man
home
with
it
he
hobbled
away
through
the
forest
and
as
he
went
he
looked
back
and
there
were
the
little
queer
children
all
dancing
together
and
he
heard
them
chattering
and
shouting
who
stole
the
turnips
stole
the
turnips
who
paid
for
the
turnips
paid
for
the
turnips
who
stole
the
tablecloth
who
will
pay
for
the
tablecloth
who
will
steal
turnips
again
will
steal
turnips
again
but
the
old
man
was
too
pleased
with
the
goat
to
give
much
heed
to
what
they
said
and
he
hobbled
home
through
the
green
forest
as
fast
as
he
could
with
the
goat
trotting
and
walking
behind
him
pulling
leaves
off
the
bushes
to
chew
as
they
hurried
along
the
old
woman
was
waiting
in
the
doorway
of
the
house
she
was
still
as
angry
as
ever
have
you
beaten
the
children
she
screamed
have
you
beaten
the
children
for
stealing
my
good
turnips
no
said
the
old
man
they
paid
for
the
turnips
what
did
they
pay
they
gave
me
this
goat
that
skinny
old
goat
i
have
three
already
and
the
worst
of
them
is
better
than
that
it
has
a
cold
in
the
head
says
the
old
man
worse
than
ever
screams
the
old
woman
wait
a
minute
says
the
old
man
as
quickly
as
he
could
to
stop
her
sneeze
goat
and
the
goat
began
to
shake
itself
almost
to
bits
sneezing
and
sneezing
and
sneezing
the
good
gold
pieces
flew
all
ways
at
once
and
the
old
woman
threw
herself
after
the
gold
pieces
picking
them
up
like
an
old
hen
picking
up
corn
as
fast
as
she
picked
them
up
more
gold
pieces
came
showering
down
on
her
like
heavy
gold
hail
beating
her
on
her
head
and
her
hands
as
she
grubbed
after
those
that
had
fallen
already
stop
sneezing
goat
says
the
old
man
and
the
goat
stood
there
tired
and
panting
trying
to
get
its
breath
but
the
old
woman
did
not
look
up
till
she
had
gathered
everyone
of
the
gold
pieces
when
she
did
look
up
she
said
there
no
supper
for
you
i
had
supper
already
the
old
man
said
nothing
he
tied
up
the
goat
to
the
doorpost
of
the
house
where
it
could
eat
the
green
grass
then
he
went
into
the
house
and
lay
down
and
fell
asleep
at
once
because
he
was
an
old
man
and
had
done
a
lot
of
walking
as
soon
as
he
was
asleep
the
old
woman
untied
the
goat
and
took
it
away
and
hid
it
in
the
bushes
and
tied
up
one
of
her
own
goats
instead
they
were
my
turnips
says
she
to
herself
and
i
do
see
why
he
should
have
a
share
in
the
gold
then
she
went
in
and
lay
down
grumbling
to
herself
early
in
the
morning
she
woke
the
old
man
get
up
you
lazy
fellow
says
she
you
would
lie
all
day
and
let
all
the
thieves
in
the
world
come
in
and
steal
my
turnips
up
with
you
to
the
dovecot
and
see
how
my
turnips
are
getting
on
the
old
man
got
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes
and
climbed
up
the
rickety
stairs
creak
creak
creak
holding
on
with
both
hands
till
he
came
to
the
top
of
the
house
to
the
top
of
the
tower
to
the
top
of
the
dovecot
and
looked
at
the
turnips
he
was
afraid
to
come
down
for
there
were
hardly
any
turnips
left
at
all
and
when
he
did
come
down
the
scolding
the
old
woman
gave
him
was
worse
than
the
other
two
scoldings
rolled
into
one
she
was
so
angry
that
she
shook
like
a
rag
in
the
high
wind
and
the
old
man
put
both
hands
to
his
ears
and
hobbled
away
into
the
forest
he
hobbled
along
as
fast
as
he
could
hobble
until
he
came
to
the
hut
under
the
pine
trees
this
time
the
little
queer
children
were
not
hiding
under
the
blankets
or
in
the
stove
or
chattering
in
the
hut
they
were
all
over
the
roof
of
the
hut
dancing
and
crawling
about
some
of
them
were
even
sitting
on
the
chimney
and
everyone
of
the
little
queer
children
was
playing
with
a
turnip
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
old
man
they
all
came
tumbling
off
the
roof
one
after
another
head
over
heels
like
a
lot
of
peas
rolling
off
a
shovel
stole
the
turnips
they
shouted
before
the
old
man
could
say
anything
at
all
i
know
you
did
says
the
old
man
but
that
does
not
make
it
any
better
for
me
and
it
is
i
who
get
the
scolding
when
the
turnips
fly
away
in
the
night
never
again
shouted
the
children
i
glad
to
hear
that
says
the
old
man
and
we
pay
for
the
turnips
thank
you
kindly
says
the
old
man
he
had
the
heart
to
be
angry
with
those
little
queer
children
three
or
four
of
them
ran
into
the
hut
and
came
out
again
with
a
wooden
whistle
a
regular
such
as
shepherds
use
they
gave
it
to
the
old
man
i
can
never
play
that
says
the
old
man
i
do
know
one
tune
from
another
and
if
i
did
my
old
fingers
are
as
stiff
as
oak
twigs
blow
in
it
cried
the
children
and
all
the
others
came
crowding
round
laughing
and
chattering
and
whispering
to
each
other
is
he
going
to
blow
in
it
they
asked
he
going
to
blow
in
it
how
they
laughed
the
old
man
took
the
whistle
and
gathered
his
breath
and
puffed
out
his
cheeks
and
blew
in
the
as
hard
as
he
could
and
before
he
could
take
the
whistle
from
his
lips
three
lively
whips
had
slipped
out
of
it
and
were
beating
him
as
hard
as
they
could
go
although
there
was
nobody
to
hold
them
phew
phew
phew
the
three
whips
came
down
on
him
one
after
the
other
blow
again
the
children
shouted
laughing
as
if
they
were
mad
blow
again
quick
quick
quick
and
tell
the
whips
to
get
into
the
whistle
the
old
man
did
not
wait
to
be
told
twice
he
blew
for
all
he
was
worth
and
instantly
the
three
whips
stopped
beating
him
into
the
whistle
he
cried
and
the
three
lively
whips
shot
up
into
the
whistle
like
three
snakes
going
into
a
hole
he
could
hardly
have
believed
they
had
been
out
at
all
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
soreness
of
his
back
you
take
that
home
cried
the
children
that
pay
for
the
turnips
and
put
everything
right
who
knows
said
the
old
man
and
he
thanked
the
children
and
set
off
home
through
the
green
forest
cried
the
little
queer
children
but
as
soon
as
he
had
started
they
forgot
all
about
him
when
he
looked
round
to
wave
his
hand
to
them
not
one
of
them
was
thinking
of
him
they
were
up
again
on
the
roof
of
the
hut
jumping
over
each
other
and
dancing
and
crawling
about
and
rolling
each
other
down
the
roof
and
climbing
up
again
as
if
they
had
been
doing
nothing
else
all
day
and
were
going
to
do
nothing
else
till
the
end
of
the
world
the
old
man
hobbled
home
through
the
green
forest
with
the
whistle
stuck
safely
away
into
his
shirt
as
soon
as
he
came
to
the
door
of
the
hut
the
old
woman
who
was
sitting
inside
counting
the
gold
pieces
jumped
up
and
started
her
scolding
what
have
the
children
tricked
you
with
this
time
she
screamed
at
him
they
gave
me
a
says
the
old
man
and
they
are
not
going
to
steal
the
turnips
any
more
a
she
screamed
what
the
good
of
that
it
worse
than
the
tablecloth
and
the
skinny
old
goat
the
old
man
said
nothing
give
it
to
me
screamed
the
old
woman
they
were
my
turnips
so
it
is
my
well
whatever
you
do
do
blow
in
it
says
the
old
man
and
he
hands
over
the
she
would
listen
to
him
what
says
she
i
must
not
blow
my
own
and
with
that
she
put
the
to
her
lips
and
blew
out
jumped
the
three
lively
whips
flew
up
in
the
air
and
began
to
beat
her
phew
phew
phew
one
after
another
if
they
made
the
old
man
sore
it
was
nothing
to
what
they
did
to
the
cross
old
woman
stop
them
stop
them
she
screamed
running
this
way
and
that
in
the
hut
with
the
whips
flying
after
her
beating
her
all
the
time
never
scold
again
i
am
to
blame
i
stole
the
magic
tablecloth
and
put
an
old
one
instead
of
it
i
hid
it
in
the
iron
chest
she
ran
to
the
iron
chest
and
opened
it
and
pulled
out
the
tablecloth
stop
them
stop
them
she
screamed
while
the
whips
laid
it
on
hard
and
fast
one
after
the
other
i
am
to
blame
the
goat
that
sneezes
gold
pieces
is
hidden
in
the
bushes
the
goat
by
the
door
is
one
of
the
old
ones
i
wanted
all
the
gold
for
myself
all
this
time
the
old
man
was
trying
to
get
hold
of
the
but
the
old
woman
was
running
about
the
hut
so
fast
with
the
whips
flying
after
her
and
beating
her
that
he
could
not
get
it
out
of
her
hands
at
last
he
grabbed
it
into
the
whistle
says
he
and
put
it
to
his
lips
and
blew
in
a
moment
the
three
lively
whips
had
hidden
themselves
in
the
whistle
and
there
was
the
cross
old
woman
kissing
his
hand
and
promising
never
to
scold
any
more
that
all
right
says
the
old
man
and
he
fetched
the
sneezing
goat
out
of
the
bushes
and
made
it
sneeze
a
little
gold
just
to
be
sure
that
it
was
that
goat
and
no
other
then
he
laid
the
tablecloth
on
the
table
and
told
it
to
turn
inside
out
up
it
flew
and
came
down
again
with
the
best
dinner
that
ever
was
cooked
only
waiting
to
be
eaten
and
the
old
man
and
the
old
woman
sat
down
and
ate
till
they
could
eat
no
more
the
old
woman
rubbed
herself
now
and
again
and
the
old
man
rubbed
himself
too
but
there
was
never
a
cross
word
between
them
and
they
went
to
bed
singing
like
nightingales
is
that
the
end
maroosia
always
asked
is
that
all
asked
vanya
though
he
knew
it
was
not
not
quite
said
old
peter
but
the
tale
wo
go
any
quicker
than
my
old
tongue
in
the
morning
the
old
woman
had
forgotten
about
her
promise
and
just
from
habit
she
set
about
scolding
the
old
man
as
if
the
whips
had
never
jumped
out
of
the
whistle
she
scolded
him
for
sleeping
too
long
sent
him
upstairs
with
a
lot
of
cross
words
after
him
to
go
to
the
top
of
the
dovecot
to
see
how
those
turnips
were
getting
on
after
a
little
the
old
man
came
down
the
turnips
are
coming
on
grandly
says
he
and
not
a
single
one
has
gone
in
the
night
i
told
you
the
children
said
they
would
not
steal
any
more
i
do
believe

said
the
old
woman
i
see
for
myself
and
if
any
are
gone
you
shall
pay
for
it
and
pay
for
it
well
up
she
jumped
and
tried
to
climb
the
stairs
but
the
stairs
were
narrow
and
steep
and
twisting
she
tried
and
tried
and
could
not
get
up
at
all
so
she
gets
angrier
than
ever
and
starts
scolding
the
old
man
again
you
must
carry
me
up
says
she
i
have
to
hold
on
with
both
hands
or

could
get
up
myself

the
old
man
i
get
in
the
flour
sack
and
you
must
carry
me
up
with
your
teeth
says
she
they
strong
enough
and
the
old
woman
got
into
the
flour
sack
do
ask
me
any
questions
says
the
old
man
and
he
took
the
sack
in
his
teeth
and
began
slowly
climbing
up
the
stairs
holding
on
with
both
hands
he
climbed
and
climbed
but
he
did
not
climb
fast
enough
for
the
old
woman
are
we
at
the
top
says
she
the
old
man
said
nothing
but
went
on
climbing
up
and
up
nearly
dead
with
the
weight
of
the
old
woman
in
the
sack
which
he
was
holding
in
his
teeth
he
climbed
a
little
further
and
the
old
woman
screamed
out
are
we
at
the
top
now
we
must
be
at
the
top
let
me
out
you
old
fool
the
old
man
said
nothing
he
climbed
on
and
on
the
old
woman
raged
in
the
flour
sack
she
jumped
about
in
the
sack
and
screamed
at
the
old
man
are
we
near
the
top
now
answer
me
ca
you
answer
me
at
once
or
you
pay
for
it
later
are
we
near
the
top
very
near
said
the
old
man
and
as
he
opened
his
mouth
to
say
that
the
sack
slipped
from
between
his
teeth
and
bump
bump
bumpety
bump
the
old
woman
in
the
sack
fell
all
the
way
to
the
very
bottom
bumping
on
every
step
that
was
the
end
of
her
after
that
the
old
man
lived
alone
in
the
hut
when
he
wanted
tobacco
or
clothes
or
a
new
axe
he
made
the
goat
sneeze
some
gold
pieces
and
off
he
went
to
the
town
with
plenty
of
money
in
his
pocket
when
he
wanted
his
dinner
he
had
only
to
lay
the
tablecloth
he
never
had
any
washing
up
to
do
because
the
tablecloth
did
it
for
him
when
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
troublesome
guests
he
gave
them
the
whistle
to
blow
and
when
he
was
lonely
and
wanted
company
he
went
to
the
little
hut
under
the
pine
trees
and
played
with
the
little
queer
children
little
master
misery
once
upon
a
time
there
were
two
brothers
peasants
and
one
was
kind
and
the
other
was
cunning
and
the
cunning
one
made
money
and
became
rich
very
rich
so
rich
that
he
thought
himself
far
too
good
for
the
village
he
went
off
to
the
town
and
dressed
in
fine
furs
and
clothed
his
wife
in
rich
brocades
and
made
friends
among
the
merchants
and
began
to
live
as
merchants
live
eating
all
day
long
no
longer
like
a
simple
peasant
who
eats
kasha
one
day
kasha
the
next
day
and
for
a
change
kasha
on
the
third
day
also
and
always
he
grew
richer
and
richer
it
was
very
different
with
the
kind
one
he
lent
money
to
a
neighbour
and
the
neighbour
never
paid
it
back
he
sowed
before
the
last
frost
and
lost
all
his
crops
his
horse
went
lame
his
cow
gave
no
milk
if
his
hens
laid
eggs
they
were
stolen
and
if
he
set
a
in
the
river
some
one
else
always
pulled
it
out
and
stole
the
fish
and
the
hooks
everything
went
wrong
with
him
and
each
day
saw
him
poorer
than
the
day
before
at
last
there
came
a
time
when
he
had
not
a
crumb
of
bread
in
the
house
he
and
his
wife
were
thin
as
sticks
because
they
had
nothing
to
eat
and
the
children
were
crying
all
day
long
because
of
their
little
empty
stomachs
from
morning
till
night
he
dug
and
worked
struggling
against
poverty
like
a
fish
against
the
ice
but
it
was
no
good
things
went
from
bad
to
worse
at
last
his
wife
said
to
him
you
must
go
to
the
town
and
see
that
rich
brother
of
yours
he
will
surely
not
refuse
to
give
you
a
little
help
and
he
said
truly
wife
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
done
i
will
go
to
the
town
and
perhaps
my
rich
brother
will
help
me
i
am
sure
he
would
not
let
my
children
starve
after
all
he
is
their
uncle
so
he
took
his
stick
and
tramped
off
to
the
town
he
came
to
the
house
of
his
rich
brother
a
fine
house
it
was
with
painted
eaves
and
a
doorway
carved
by
a
master
many
servants
were
there
and
food
in
plenty
and
people
coming
and
going
he
went
in
and
found
his
brother
and
said
dear
brother
of
mine
i
beg
you
help
me
even
if
only
a
little
my
wife
and
children
are
without
bread
all
day
long
they
sit
hungry
and
waiting
and
i
have
no
food
to
give
them
the
rich
brother
looks
at
him
and
hums
and
strokes
his
beard
then
says
he
i
will
help
you
but
of
course
you
must
do
something
in
return
stay
here
and
work
for
me
and
at
the
end
of
a
week
you
shall
have
the
help
you
have
earned
the
poor
brother
thanked
him
and
bowed
and
kissed
his
hand
and
praised
god
for
the
kindness
of
his
brother
heart
and
set
instantly
to
work
for
a
whole
week
he
slaved
and
scarcely
slept
he
cleaned
out
the
stables
and
cut
the
wood
swept
the
yard
drew
water
from
the
well
and
ran
errands
for
the
cook
and
at
the
end
of
the
week
his
brother
called
him
and
gave
him
a
single
loaf
of
bread
you
must
not
forget
says
the
rich
brother
that
i
have
fed
you
all
the
week
you
have
been
here
and
all
that
food
counts
in
the
payment
the
poor
brother
thanked
him
and
was
setting
off
to
carry
the
loaf
to
his
wife
and
children
when
the
rich
brother
called
him
back
stop
a
minute
said
he
i
would
like
you
to
know
that
i
am
well
disposed
towards

wife
with
you

i
do
that
brother

rich
merchants
with
fine
clothes
and
boots
on
their
feet
and
i
have
nothing
but
my
old
coat
and
my
legs
are
bound
in
rags
and
my
feet
shuffle
along
in
straw
slippers
i
do
not

guests

rich
brother

a
place
for
you
very
good
brother
and
thank
you
kindly
god
be
praised
for
having
given
you
a
tender
heart
and
the
poor
brother
though
he
was
tired
out
after
all
the
work
he
had
done
set
off
home
as
fast
as
he
could
to
take
the
bread
to
his
wife
and
children
he
might
have
given
you
more
than
that
said
his
wife
but

he

of
this

are
invited

heart

say
we
shall
be
able
to
bring
back
something
for
the
children
a
pleasure
like
that
does
not
often
come
our
way
said
his
wife
so
early
in
the
morning
they
got
up
and
walked
all
the
way
to
the
town
so
as
not
to
shame
the
rich
brother
by
putting
up
their
old
cart
in
the
yard
beside
the
merchants
fine
carriages
they
came
to
the
rich
brother
house
and
found
the
guests
all
assembled
and
making
merry
rich
merchants
and
their
plump
wives
all
eating
and
laughing
and
drinking
and
talking
they
wished
a
long
life
to
the
rich
brother
and
the
poor
brother
wanted
to
make
a
speech
congratulating
him
on
his
but
the
rich
brother
scarcely
thanked
him
because
he
was
so
busy
entertaining
the
rich
merchants
and
their
plump
laughing
wives
he
was
pressing
food
on
his
guests
now
this
now
that
and
calling
to
the
servants
to
keep
their
glasses
filled
and
their
plates
full
of
all
the
tastiest
kinds
of
food
as
for
the
poor
brother
and
his
wife
the
rich
one
forgot
all
about
them
and
they
got
nothing
to
eat
and
never
a
drop
to
drink
they
just
sat
there
with
empty
plates
and
empty
glasses
watching
how
the
others
ate
and
drank
the
poor
brother
laughed
with
the
rest
because
he
did
not
wish
to
show
that
he
had
been
forgotten
the
dinner
came
to
an
end
one
by
one
the
guests
went
up
to
the
giver
of
the
feast
to
thank
him
for
his
good
cheer
and
the
poor
brother
too
got
up
from
the
bench
and
bowed
low
before
his
brother
and
thanked
him
the
guests
went
home
drunken
and
joyful
a
fine
noise
they
made
as
people
do
on
these
occasions
shouting
jokes
to
each
other
and
singing
songs
at
the
top
of
their
voices
the
poor
brother
and
his
wife
went
home
empty
and
sad
all
that
long
way
they
had
walked
and
now
they
had
to
walk
it
again
and
the
feast
was
over
and
never
a
bite
had
they
had
in
their
mouths
nor
a
drop
in
their
gullets
come
wife
says
the
poor
brother
as
he
trudged
along
let
us
sing
a
song
like
the
others
what
a
fool
you
are
says
his
wife
hungry
and
cross
she
was
as
even
maroosia
would
be
after
a
day
like
that
watching
other
people
stuff
themselves
what
a
fool
you
are
says
she
people
may
very
well
sing
when
they
have
eaten
tasty
dishes
and
drunk
good
wine
but
what
reason
have
you
got
for
making
a
merry
noise
in
the
night
why
my
dear
says
he
we
have
been
at
my
brother
feast
i
am
ashamed
to
go
home
without
a
song
i
sing
i
sing
so
that
everyone
shall
think
he
loaded
us
with
good
things
like
the
rest
well
sing
if
you
like
but
you
sing
by
yourself
so
the
peasant
the
poor
brother
started
singing
a
song
with
his
dry
throat
he
lifted
his
voice
and
sang
like
the
rest
while
his
wife
trudged
silently
beside
him
but
as
he
sang
it
seemed
to
the
peasant
that
he
heard
two
voices
singing
his
own
and
another
he
stopped
and
asked
his
wife
is
that
you
joining
in
my
song
with
a
little
thin
voice
what
the
matter
with
you
i
never
thought
of
singing
with
you
i
never
opened
my
mouth
who
is
it
then
no
one
except
yourself
any
one
would
say
you
had
had
a
drink
of
wine
after
all
but
i
heard
some
one
a
little
weak
voice
a
little
sad
voice
joining
with
mine
i
heard
nothing
said
his
wife
but
sing
again
and
i
listen
the
poor
man
sang
again
he
sang
alone
his
wife
listened
and
it
was
clear
that
there
were
two
voices
singing
the
dry
voice
of
the
poor
man
and
a
little
miserable
voice
that
came
from
the
shadows
under
the
trees
the
poor
man
stopped
and
asked
out
loud
who
are
you
who
are
singing
with
me
and
a
little
thin
voice
answered
out
of
the
shadows
by
the
roadside
under
the
trees

was

master
misery
and

other
friend
in
the
world
and
a
wretched
little
man
with
a
miserable
face
and
little
thin
legs
and
arms
came
out
of
the
shadows
and
went
home
with
the
peasant
and
his
wife
it
was
late
when
they
got
home
but
little
master
misery
asked
the
peasant
to
take
him
to
the
tavern
after
such
a
day
as
this
has
been
says
he
there

else
to
be
done
but
i

no
money
says
the
peasant
illustration
misery
seated
himself
firmly
on
his
shoulders
and
pulled
out
handfuls
of
his
hair
what
of
that
says
little
master
misery
spring
has
begun
and

it
or
not
you
wo

it
bring
it
along
to
the
tavern
and
change
it
for
a
drink
the
poor
man
went
to
the
tavern
with
little
master
misery
and
they
sat
there
and
drank
the
vodka
that
the
gave
them
in
exchange
for
the
coat
next
day
early
in
the
morning
little
master
misery
began
complaining
his
head
ached
and
he
could
not
open
his
eyes
and
he
did
not
like
the
weather
and
the
children
were
crying
and
there
was
no
food
in
the
house
he
asked
the
peasant
to
come
with
him
to
the
tavern
again
and
forget
all
this
wretchedness
in
a
drink
but
i
got
no
money
says
the
peasant
rubbish
says
little
master
misery
you
have
a
sledge
and
a
cart
they
took
the
cart
and
the
sledge
to
the
tavern
and
stayed
there
drinking
until
the
said
they
had
had
all
that
the
cart
and
the
sledge
were
worth
then
the
took
them
and
threw
them
out
of
doors
into
the
night
and
they
picked
themselves
up
and
crawled
home
next
day
misery
complained
worse
than
before
and
begged
the
peasant
to
come
with
him
to
the
tavern
there
was
no
getting
rid
of
him
no
keeping
him
quiet
the
peasant
sold
his
barrow
and
plough
so
that
he
could
no
longer
work
his
land
he
went
to
the
tavern
with
little
master
misery
a
month
went
by
like
that
and
at
the
end
of
it
the
peasant
had
nothing
left
at
all
he
had
even
pledged
the
hut
he
lived
in
to
a
neighbour
and
taken
the
money
to
the
tavern
and
every
day
little
master
misery
begged
him
to
come
there
i
am
not
wretched
any
longer
says
misery
there
i
sing
and
even
dance
hitting
the
floor
with
my
heels
and
making
a
merry
noise
but
now
i
have
no
money
at
all
and
nothing
left
to
sell
says
the
poor
peasant
i
be
willing
enough
to
go
with
you
but
i
ca
and
here
is
an
end
of
it
rubbish
says
misery

once

the
better
of
the
two

a
just
man
and

give
us
more
drink
for
the
better
one
the
peasant
took
the
dress
and
sold
it
and
misery
laughed
and
danced
while
the
peasant
thought
to
himself
well
this
is
the
end
nothing
left
to
sell
and
my
wife
has
nothing
either
we
the
clothes
on
our
backs
and
nothing
else
in
the
world
in
the
morning
little
master
misery
woke
with
a
headache
as
usual
and
a
mouthful
of
groans
and
complaints
but
he
saw
that
the
peasant
had
nothing
left
to
sell
and
he
called
out
listen
to
me
master
of
the
house
what
is
it
misery
says
the
peasant
who
was
master
of
nothing
in
the
world
go
you
to
a
neighbour
and
beg
the
loan
of
a
cart
and
a
pair
of
good
oxen
the
poor
peasant
had
no
will
of
his
own
left
he
did
exactly
as
he
was
told
he
went
to
his
neighbour
and
begged
the
loan
of
the
oxen
and
cart
but
how
will
you
repay
me
says
the
neighbour
i
will
do
a
week
work
for
you
for
nothing
very
well
says
the
neighbour
take
the
oxen
and
cart
but
be
careful
not
to
give
them
too
heavy
a
load
indeed
i
wo
says
the
peasant
thinking
to
himself
that
he
had
nothing
to
load
them
with
and
thank
you
very
much
says
he
and
he
goes
back
to
misery
taking
with
him
the
oxen
and
cart
misery
looked
at
him
and
grumbled
in
his
wretched
little
voice
they
are
hardly
strong
enough
they
are
the
best
i
could
borrow
says
the
peasant
and
you
and
i
have
starved
too
long
to
be
heavy
and
the
peasant
and
little
master
misery
sat
together
in
the
cart
and
drove
off
together
misery
holding
his
head
in
both
hands
and
groaning
at
the
jolt
of
the
cart
as
soon
as
they
had
left
the
village
misery
sat
up
and
asked
the
peasant
do
you
know
the
big
stone
that
stands
alone
in
the
middle
of
a
field
not
far
from
here
of
course
i
know
it
says
the
peasant
drive
straight
to
it
says
misery
and
went
on
rocking
himself
to
and
fro
and
groaning
and
complaining
in
his
wretched
little
voice
they
came
to
the
stone
and
got
down
from
the
cart
and
looked
at
the
stone
it
was
very
big
and
heavy
and
was
fixed
in
the
ground
heave
it
up
says
misery
the
poor
peasant
set
to
work
to
heave
it
up
and
misery
helped
him
groaning
and
complaining
that
the
peasant
was
nothing
of
a
fellow
because
he
could
not
do
his
work
by
himself
well
they
heaved
it
up
and
there
below
it
was
a
deep
hole
and
the
hole
was
filled
with
gold
pieces
to
the
very
top
more
gold
pieces
than
ever
you
will
see
copper
ones
if
you
live
to
be
a
hundred
and
ten
well
what
are
you
staring
at
says
misery
stir
yourself
and
be
quick
about
it
and
load
all
this
gold
into
the
cart
the
peasant
set
to
work
and
piled
all
the
gold
into
the
cart
down
to
the
very
last
gold
piece
while
misery
sat
on
the
stone
and
watched
groaning
and
chuckling
in
his
weak
wretched
little
voice
be
quick
says
misery
and
then
we
can
get
back
to
the
tavern
the
peasant
looked
into
the
pit
to
see
that
there
was
nothing
left
there
and
then
says
he
just
take
a
look
little
master
misery
and
see
that
we
have
left
nothing
behind
you
are
smaller
than
i
and
can
get
right
down
into
the
pit
misery
slipped
down
from
the
stone
grumbling
at
the
peasant
and
bent
over
the
pit
you
taken
the
lot
says
he
there
nothing
to
be
seen
but
what
is
that
says
the
peasant
there
shining
in
the
corner
i
do
see
it
jump
down
into
the
pit
and
you
see
it
it
would
be
a
pity
to
waste
a
gold
piece
misery
jumped
down
into
the
pit
and
instantly
the
peasant
rolled
the
stone
over
the
hole
and
shut
him
in
things
will
be
better
so
says
the
peasant
if
i
were
to
let
you
out
of
that
sooner
or
later
you
would
drink
up
all
this
money
just
as
you
drank
up
everything
i
had
then
the
peasant
drove
home
and
hid
the
gold
in
the
cellar
took
the
oxen
and
cart
back
to
his
neighbour
thanked
him
kindly
and
began
to
think
what
he
would
do
now
that
misery
was
his
master
no
longer
and
he
with
plenty
of
money
but
he
had
to
work
for
a
week
to
pay
for
the
loan
of
the
oxen
and
cart
said
vanya
well
during
the
week
while
he
was
working
he
was
thinking
all
the
time
in
his
head
said
old
peter
a
little
grumpily
then
he
went
on
with
his
tale
as
soon
as
the
week
was
over
he
bought
a
forest
and
built
himself
a
fine
house
and
began
to
live
twice
as
richly
as
his
brother
in
the
town
and
his
wife
had
two
new
dresses
perhaps
more
with
a
lot
of
gold
and
silver
braid
and
necklaces
of
big
yellow
stones
and
bracelets
and
sparkling
rings
his
children
were
well
fed
every
day
rivers
of
milk
between
banks
of
kisel
jelly
and
mushrooms
with
sauce
and
soup
and
cakes
with
little
balls
of
egg
and
meat
hidden
in
the
middle
and
they
had
toys
that
squeaked
a
little
boy
feeding
a
goose
that
poked
its
head
into
a
dish
and
a
painted
hen
with
a
lot
of
chickens
that
all
squeaked
together
time
went
on
and
when
his
drew
near
he
thought
of
his
brother
the
merchant
and
drove
off
to
the
town
to
invite
him
to
take
part
in
the
feast
i
have
not
forgotten
brother
that
you
invited
me
to
yours
what
a
fellow
you
are
says
his
brother
you
have
nothing
to
eat
yourself
and
here
you
are
inviting
other
people
for
your
yes
said
the
peasant
once
upon
a
time
it
is
true
i
had
nothing
to
eat
but
now
praise
be
to
god
i
am
no
poorer
than
yourself
come
to
my
feast
and
you
will
see
very
well
says
his
brother
i
come
but
do
think
you
can
play
any
jokes
on
me
on
the
morning
of
the
peasant
his
brother
the
merchant
in
the
town
put
on
his
best
clothes
and
his
plump
wife
dressed
in
all
her
richest
and
they
got
into
their
cart
a
fine
cart
it
was
too
painted
in
the
brightest
colours
and
off
they
drove
together
to
the
house
of
the
brother
who
had
once
been
poor
they
took
a
basket
of
food
with
them
in
case
he
had
only
been
joking
when
he
invited
them
to
his
feast
they
drove
to
the
village
and
asked
for
him
at
the
hut
where
he
used
to
be
an
old
man
hobbling
along
the
road
answered
them
oh
you
mean
our
ivan
ilyitch
well
he
does
not
live
here
any
longer
where
have
you
been
that
you
have
not
heard
his
is
the
big
new
house
on
the
hill
you
can
see
it
through
the
trees
over
there
where
all
these
people
are
walking
he
has
a
kind
heart
he
has
and
riches
have
not
spoiled
it
he
has
invited
the
whole
village
to
feast
with
him
because
is
his
riches
thought
the
merchant
a
new
house
he
was
very
much
surprised
but
as
he
drove
along
the
road
he
was
more
surprised
still
for
he
passed
all
the
villagers
on
their
way
to
the
feast
and
every
one
was
talking
of
his
brother
and
how
kind
he
was
and
how
generous
and
what
a
feast
there
was
going
to
be
and
how
many
barrels
of
mead
and
wine
had
been
taken
up
to
the
house
all
the
folk
were
hurrying
along
the
road
licking
their
lips
each
one
going
faster
than
the
other
so
as
to
be
sure
not
to
miss
any
of
the
good
things
the
rich
brother
from
the
town
drove
with
his
wife
into
the
courtyard
of
the
fine
new
house
and
there
on
the
steps
was
the
peasant
brother
ivan
ilyitch
and
his
wife
receiving
their
guests
and
if
the
rich
brother
was
well
dressed
the
peasant
was
better
dressed
and
if
the
rich
brother
wife
was
in
her
fine
clothes
the
peasant
wife
fairly
glittered
what
with
the
gold
braid
on
her
bosom
and
the
shining
silver
in
her
hair
and
the
peasant
brother
kissed
his
brother
from
the
town
on
both
cheeks
and
gave
him
and
his
wife
the
best
places
at
the
table
he
fed
them
ah
how
he
fed
them
with
little
red
slips
of
smoked
salmon
and
beetroot
soup
with
cream
and
slabs
of
sturgeon
and
meats
of
three
or
four
kinds
and
game
and
sweetmeats
of
the
best
there
never
was
such
a
feast
no
not
even
at
the
wedding
of
a
tzar
and
as
for
drink
there
were
red
wine
and
white
wine
and
beer
and
mead
in
great
barrels
and
everywhere
the
peasant
went
about
among
his
guests
filling
glasses
and
seeing
that
their
plates
were
kept
piled
with
the
foods
each
one
liked
best
and
the
rich
brother
wondered
and
wondered
and
at
last
he
could
wait
no
longer
and
he
took
his
brother
aside
and
said
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
so
rich
but
tell
me
i
beg
you
how
it
was
that
all
this
good
fortune
came
to
you
the
poor
brother
never
thinking
told
him
all
the
whole
truth
about
little
master
misery
and
the
pit
full
of
gold
and
how
misery
was
shut
in
there
under
the
big
stone
the
merchant
brother
listened
and
did
not
forget
a
word
he
could
hardly
bear
himself
for
envy
and
as
for
his
wife
she
was
worse
she
looked
at
the
peasant
wife
with
her
beautiful
and
she
bit
her
lips
till
they
bled
as
soon
as
they
could
they
said
and
drove
off
home
the
merchant
brother
could
not
bear
the
thought
that
his
brother
was
richer
than
he
he
said
to
himself
i
will
go
to
the
field
and
move
the
stone
and
let
master
misery
out
then
he
will
go
and
tear
my
brother
to
pieces
for
shutting
him
in
and
his
riches
will
not
be
of
much
use
to
him
then
even
if
misery
does
not
give
them
to
me
as
a
token
of
gratitude
think
of
my
brother
daring
to
show
off
his
riches
to
me
so
he
drove
off
to
the
field
and
came
at
last
to
the
big
stone
he
moved
the
stone
on
one
side
and
then
bent
over
the
pit
to
see
what
was
in
it
he
had
scarcely
put
his
head
over
the
edge
before
misery
sprang
up
out
of
the
pit
seated
himself
firmly
on
his
shoulders
squeezed
his
neck
between
his
little
wiry
legs
and
pulled
out
handfuls
of
his
hair
scream
away
cried
little
master
misery
you
tried
to
kill
me
shutting
me
up
in
there
while
you
went
off
and
bought
fine
clothes
you
tried
to
kill
me
and
came
to
feast
your
eyes
on
my
corpse
now
whatever
happens
i
never
leave
you
again
listen
misery
screamed
the
merchant
ai
ai
stop
pulling
my
hair
you
are
choking
me
ai
listen
it
was
not
i
who
shut
you
in
under
the
stone
who
was
it
if
it
was
not
you
asked
misery
tugging
out
his
hair
and
digging
his
knees
into
the
merchant
throat
it
was
my
brother
i
came
here
on
purpose
to
let
you
out
i
came
out
of
pity
misery
tugged
the
merchant
hair
and
twisted
the
merchant
ears
till
they
nearly
came
off
liar
liar
he
shouted
in
his
little
wretched
angry
voice
you
tricked
me
once
do
you
think
you
get
the
better
of
me
again
by
a
clumsy
lie
of
that
kind
now
then
gee
up
home
we
go
and
so
the
rich
brother
went
trotting
home
crying
with
pain
while
little
master
misery
sat
firmly
on
his
shoulders
pulling
at
his
hair
instantly
misery
was
at
his
old
tricks
you
seem
to
have
bought
a
good
deal
with
the
gold
he
said
looking
at
the
merchant
house
we
see
how
far
it
will
go
and
every
day
he
rode
the
rich
merchant
to
the
tavern
and
made
him
drink
up
all
his
money
and
his
house
his
clothes
his
horses
and
carts
and
sledges
everything
he
had
until
he
was
as
poor
as
his
brother
had
been
in
the
beginning
the
merchant
thought
and
thought
and
puzzled
his
brain
to
find
a
way
to
get
rid
of
him
and
at
last
one
night
when
misery
had
groaned
himself
to
sleep
the
merchant
went
out
into
the
yard
and
took
a
big
cart
wheel
and
made
two
stout
wedges
of
wood
just
big
enough
to
fit
into
the
hub
of
the
wheel
he
drove
one
wedge
firmly
in
at
one
end
of
the
hub
and
left
the
wheel
in
the
yard
with
the
other
wedge
and
a
big
hammer
lying
handy
close
to
it
in
the
morning
misery
wakes
as
usual
and
cries
out
to
be
taken
to
the
tavern
we
sold
everything
i
got
says
the
merchant
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
amuse
me
says
misery
let
play
in
the
yard
says
the
merchant
right
says
misery
but
you
never
find
me
for
i
can
make
myself
so
small
i
can
hide
in
a
in
the
floor
we
see
says
the
merchant
the
merchant
hid
first
and
misery
found
him
at
once
now
it
my
turn
says
misery
but
what
the
good
you
never
find
me
why
i
could
get
inside
the
hub
of
that
wheel
if
i
had
a
mind
to
what
a
liar
you
are
says
the
merchant
you
never
could
get
into
that
little
hole
look
says
misery
and
he
made
himself
little
little
little
and
sat
on
the
hub
of
the
wheel
look
says
he
making
himself
smaller
again
and
then
pouf
in
he
pops
into
the
hole
of
the
hub
instantly
the
merchant
took
the
other
wedge
and
the
hammer
and
drove
the
wedge
into
the
hole
the
first
wedge
had
closed
up
the
other
end
and
so
there
was
misery
shut
up
inside
the
hub
of
the
cart
wheel
the
merchant
set
the
wheel
on
his
shoulders
and
took
it
to
the
river
and
threw
it
out
as
far
as
he
could
and
it
went
floating
away
down
to
the
sea
then
he
went
home
and
set
to
work
to
make
money
again
and
earn
his
daily
bread
for
misery
had
made
him
so
poor
that
he
had
nothing
left
and
had
to
hire
himself
out
to
make
a
living
just
as
his
peasant
brother
used
to
do
but
what
happened
to
misery
when
he
went
floating
away
he
floated
away
down
the
river
shut
up
in
the
hub
of
the
wheel
he
ought
to
have
starved
there
but
i
am
afraid
some
silly
greedy
fellow
thought
to
get
a
new
wheel
for
nothing
and
pulled
the
wedges
out
and
let
him
go
for
by
all
i
hear
misery
is
still
wandering
about
the
world
and
making
people
wretched
bad
luck
to
him
a
chapter
of
fish
sometimes
in
spring
when
the
big
river
flooded
its
banks
and
made
lakes
of
the
meadows
and
the
little
rivers
flowed
deep
old
peter
spent
a
few
days
netting
fish
also
in
summer
he
set
in
the
little
river
not
far
from
where
it
left
the
forest
and
so
it
happened
that
one
day
he
sat
in
the
warm
sunshine
outside
his
hut
mending
his
nets
and
making
floats
for
them
not
cork
floats
like
ours
but
little
rolls
of
the
silver
bark
of
the
birch
tree
and
while
he
sat
there
vanya
and
maroosia
watched
him
and
sometimes
even
helped
holding
a
piece
of
the
net
between
them
while
old
peter
fastened
on
the
little
glistening
rolls
of
bark
that
were
to
keep
it
up
in
the
water
and
all
the
time
old
peter
worked
he
smoked
and
told
them
stories
about
fish
first
he
told
them
what
happened
when
the
first
pike
was
born
and
how
it
is
that
all
the
little
fish
are
not
eaten
by
the
great
pike
with
his
huge
greedy
mouth
and
his
sharp
teeth
on
the
night
of
ivanov
day
that
is
the
day
of
saint
john
which
is
midsummer
there
was
born
the
pike
a
huge
fish
with
such
teeth
as
never
were
and
when
the
pike
was
born
the
waters
of
the
river
foamed
and
raged
so
that
the
ships
in
the
river
were
all
but
swamped
and
the
pretty
young
girls
who
were
playing
on
the
banks
ran
away
as
fast
as
they
could
frightened
they
were
by
the
roaring
of
the
waves
and
the
black
wind
and
the
white
foam
on
the
water
terrible
was
the
birth
of
the
pike
and
when
the
pike
was
born
he
did
not
grow
up
by
months
or
by
days
but
by
hours
every
day
it
was
two
inches
longer
than
the
day
before
in
a
month
it
was
two
yards
long
in
two
months
it
was
twelve
feet
long
in
three
months
it
was
raging
up
and
down
the
river
like
a
tempest
eating
the
bream
and
the
perch
and
all
the
small
fish
that
came
in
its
way
there
was
a
bream
or
a
perch
swimming
lazily
in
the
stream
the
pike
saw
it
as
it
raged
by
caught
it
in
its
great
white
mouth
and
instantly
the
bream
or
the
perch
was
gone
torn
to
pieces
by
the
pike
teeth
and
swallowed
as
you
would
swallow
a
sunflower
seed
and
bream
and
perch
are
big
fish
it
was
worse
for
the
little
ones
illustration
head
in
air
and
tail
in
sea
fish
fish
listen
to
me
what
was
to
be
done
the
bream
and
the
perch
put
their
heads
together
in
a
quiet
pool
it
was
clear
enough
that
the
great
pike
would
eat
everyone
of
them
so
they
called
a
meeting
of
all
the
little
fish
and
set
to
thinking
what
could
be
done
by
way
of
dealing
with
the
great
pike
which
had
such
sharp
teeth
and
was
making
so
free
with
their
lives
they
all
came
to
the
meeting
bream
and
perch
and
roach
and
dace
and
gudgeon
yes
and
the
little
ersh
with
his
spiny
back
the
silly
roach
said
let
us
kill
the
pike
but
the
gudgeon
looked
at
him
with
his
great
eyes
and
asked
have
you
got
good
teeth
no
says
the
roach
i
have
any
teeth
you
swallow
the
pike
i
suppose
says
the
perch
my
mouth
is
too
small
then
do
not
use
it
to
talk
foolishness
said
the
gudgeon
and
the
roach
fins
blushed
scarlet
and
are
red
to
this
day
i
will
set
my
prickles
on
end
says
the
perch
who
has
a
row
of
sharp
prickles
in
the
fin
on
his
back
the
pike
wo
find
them
too
comfortable
in
his
throat
yes
said
the
bream
but
you
will
have
to
go
into
his
throat
to
put
them
there
and
he
swallow
you
all
the
same
besides
we
have
not
all
got
prickles
there
was
a
lot
more
foolishness
talked
even
the
minnows
had
something
to
say
until
they
were
made
to
be
quiet
by
the
dace
now
the
little
ersh
had
come
to
the
meeting
with
his
spiny
back
and
his
big
front
fins
and
his
head
all
shining
in
blue
and
gold
and
green
and
when
he
had
heard
all
they
had
to
say
he
began
to
talk
think
away
says
he
and
break
your
heads
and
spoil
your
brains
if
ever
you
had
any
but
listen
for
a
moment
to
what
i
have
to
say
and
all
the
fish
turned
to
listen
to
the
ersh
who
is
the
cleverest
of
all
the
little
fish
because
he
has
a
big
head
and
a
small
body
listen
says
the
ersh
it
is
clear
enough
that
the
pike
lives
in
this
big
river
and
that
he
does
not
give
the
little
fish
a
chance
crunches
them
all
with
his
sharp
teeth
and
swallows
them
ten
at
a
time
i
quite
agree
that
it
would
be
much
better
for
everybody
if
he
could
be
killed
but
not
one
of
us
is
strong
enough
for
that
we
are
not
strong
enough
to
kill
him
but
we
can
starve
him
and
save
ourselves
at
the
same
time
there
no
living
in
the
big
river
while
he
is
here
let
all
us
little
fish
clear
out
and
go
and
live
in
the
little
rivers
that
flow
into
the
big
there
the
waters
are
shallow
and
we
can
hide
among
the
weeds
no
one
will
touch
us
there
and
we
can
live
and
bring
up
our
children
in
peace
and
only
be
in
danger
when
we
go
visiting
from
one
little
river
to
another
and
as
for
the
great
pike
we
will
leave
him
alone
in
the
big
river
to
rage
hungrily
up
and
down
his
teeth
will
soon
grow
blunt
for
there
will
be
nothing
for
him
to
eat
all
the
little
fish
waved
their
fins
and
danced
in
the
water
when
they
heard
the
wisdom
of
the
ersh
speech
and
the
ersh
and
the
roach
and
the
bream
and
the
perch
and
the
dace
and
the
gudgeon
left
the
big
river
and
swam
up
the
little
rivers
between
the
green
meadows
and
there
they
began
again
to
live
in
peace
and
bring
up
their
little
ones
though
the
cunning
fishermen
set
nets
in
the
little
rivers
and
caught
many
of
them
on
their
way
from
that
time
on
there
have
never
been
many
little
fish
in
the
big
river
and
as
for
the
monstrous
pike
he
swam
up
and
down
the
great
river
lashing
the
waters
and
driving
his
nose
through
the
waves
but
found
no
food
for
his
sharp
teeth
he
had
to
take
to
worms
and
was
caught
in
the
end
on
a
fisherman
hook
yes
and
the
fisherman
made
a
soup
of
him
the
best
fish
soup
that
ever
was
made
he
was
a
friend
of
mine
when
i
was
a
boy
and
he
gave
me
a
taste
in
my
wooden
spoon
then
he
told
them
the
story
of
other
pike
and
particularly
of
the
pike
that
was
king
of
a
river
and
made
the
little
fish
come
together
on
the
top
of
the
water
so
that
the
young
hunter
could
cross
over
with
dry
feet
and
he
told
them
of
the
pike
that
hid
the
lover
of
the
princess
by
swallowing
him
and
lying
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
pool
and
how
the
princess
saw
her
lover
sitting
in
the
pike
when
the
big
fish
opened
his
mouth
to
snap
up
a
little
perch
that
swam
too
near
his
nose
then
he
told
them
of
the
big
trial
in
the
river
when
the
fishes
chose
judges
and
made
a
case
at
law
against
the
ersh
and
found
him
guilty
and
how
the
ersh
spat
in
the
faces
of
the
judges
and
swam
merrily
away
finally
he
told
them
the
story
of
the
golden
fish
but
that
is
a
long
story
and
a
chapter
all
by
itself
and
begins
on
the
next
page
the
golden
fish
this
said
old
peter
is
a
story
against
wanting
more
than
enough
long
ago
near
the
shore
of
the
blue
sea
an
old
man
lived
with
his
old
woman
in
a
little
old
hut
made
of
earth
and
moss
and
logs
they
never
had
a
rouble
to
spend
a
rouble
they
never
had
a
kopeck
they
just
lived
there
in
the
little
hut
and
the
old
man
caught
fish
out
of
the
sea
in
his
old
net
and
the
old
woman
cooked
the
fish
and
so
they
lived
poorly
enough
in
summer
and
worse
in
winter
sometimes
they
had
a
few
fish
to
sell
but
not
often
in
the
summer
evenings
they
sat
outside
their
hut
on
a
broken
old
bench
and
the
old
man
mended
the
holes
in
his
ragged
old
net
there
were
holes
in
it
a
hare
could
jump
through
with
his
ears
standing
let
alone
one
of
those
little
fishes
that
live
in
the
sea
the
old
woman
sat
on
the
bench
beside
him
and
patched
his
trousers
and
complained
well
one
day
the
old
man
went
fishing
as
he
always
did
all
day
long
he
fished
and
caught
nothing
and
then
in
the
evening
when
he
was
thinking
he
might
as
well
give
up
and
go
home
he
threw
his
net
for
the
last
time
and
when
he
came
to
pull
it
in
he
began
to
think
he
had
caught
an
island
instead
of
a
haul
of
fish
and
a
strong
and
lively
island
at
that
the
net
was
so
heavy
and
pulled
so
hard
against
his
feeble
old
arms
this
time
says
he
i
have
caught
a
hundred
fish
at
least
not
a
bit
of
it
the
net
came
in
as
heavy
as
if
it
were
full
of
fighting
fish
but
empty
empty
said
maroosia
well
not
quite
empty
said
old
peter
and
went
on
with
his
tale
not
quite
empty
for
when
the
last
of
the
net
came
ashore
there
was
something
glittering
in
it
a
golden
fish
not
very
big
and
not
very
little
caught
in
the
meshes
and
it
was
this
single
golden
fish
which
had
made
the
net
so
heavy
the
old
fisherman
took
the
golden
fish
in
his
hands
at
least
it
will
be
enough
for
supper
said
he
but
the
golden
fish
lay
still
in
his
hands
and
looked
at
him
with
wise
eyes
and
spoke
yes
my
dears
it
spoke
just
as
if
it
were
you
or
i
old
man
says
the
fish
do
not
kill
me
i
beg
you
throw
me
back
into
the
blue
waters
some
day
i
may
be
able
to
be
of
use
to
you
what
says
the
old
fisherman
and
do
you
talk
with
a
human
voice
i
do
says
the
fish
and
my
fish
heart
feels
pain
like
yours
it
would
be
as
bitter
to
me
to
die
as
it
would
be
to
yourself
and
is
that
so
says
the
old
fisherman
well
you
shall
not
die
this
time
and
he
threw
the
golden
fish
back
into
the
sea
you
would
have
thought
the
golden
fish
would
have
splashed
with
his
tail
and
turned
head
downwards
and
swum
away
into
the
blue
depths
of
the
sea
not
a
bit
of
it
it
stayed
there
with
its
tail
slowly
flapping
in
the
water
so
as
to
keep
its
head
up
and
it
looked
at
the
fisherman
with
its
wise
eyes
and
it
spoke
again
you
have
given
me
my
life
says
the
golden
fish
now
ask
anything
you
wish
from
me
and
you
shall
have
it
the
old
fisherman
stood
there
on
the
shore
combing
his
beard
with
his
old
fingers
and
thinking
think
as
he
would
he
could
not
call
to
mind
a
single
thing
he
wanted
no
fish
he
said
at
last
i
think
i
have
everything
i
need
well
if
ever
you
do
want
anything
come
and
ask
for
it
says
the
fish
and
turns
over
flashing
gold
and
goes
down
into
the
blue
sea
the
old
fisherman
went
back
to
his
hut
where
his
wife
was
waiting
for
him
what
she
screamed
out
you
have
caught
so
much
as
one
little
fish
for
our
supper
i
caught
one
fish
mother
says
the
old
man
a
golden
fish
it
was
and
it
spoke
to
me
and
i
let
it
go
and
it
told
me
to
ask
for
anything
i
wanted
and
what
did
you
ask
for
show
me
i
could
think
of
anything
to
ask
for
so
i
did
not
ask
for
anything
at
all
fool
says
his
wife
and
dolt
and
us
with
no
food
to
put
in
our
mouths
go
back
at
once
and
ask
for
some
bread
well
the
poor
old
fisherman
got
down
his
net
and
tramped
back
to
the
seashore
and
he
stood
on
the
shore
of
the
wide
blue
sea
and
he
called
out
head
in
air
and
tail
in
sea
fish
fish
listen
to
me
and
in
a
moment
there
was
the
golden
fish
with
his
head
out
of
the
water
flapping
his
tail
below
him
in
the
water
and
looking
at
the
fisherman
with
his
wise
eyes
what
is
it
said
the
fish
be
so
kind
says
the
fisherman
be
so
kind
we
have
no
bread
in
the
house
go
home
says
the
fish
and
turned
over
and
went
down
into
the
sea
god
be
good
to
me
says
the
old
fisherman
but
what
shall
i
say
to
my
wife
going
home
like
this
without
the
bread
and
he
went
home
very
wretchedly
and
slower
than
he
came
as
soon
as
he
came
within
sight
of
his
hut
he
saw
his
wife
and
she
was
waving
her
arms
and
shouting
stir
your
old
bones
she
screamed
out
it
as
fine
a
loaf
as
ever
i
seen
and
he
hurried
along
and
found
his
old
wife
cutting
up
a
huge
loaf
of
white
bread
mind
you
not
black
a
huge
loaf
of
white
bread
nearly
as
big
as
maroosia
you
did
not
do
so
badly
after
all
said
his
old
wife
as
they
sat
there
with
the
samovar
on
the
table
between
them
dipping
their
bread
in
the
hot
tea
but
that
night
as
they
lay
sleeping
on
the
stove
the
old
woman
poked
the
old
man
in
the
ribs
with
her
bony
elbow
he
groaned
and
woke
up
i
been
thinking
says
his
wife
your
fish
might
have
given
us
a
trough
to
keep
the
bread
in
while
he
was
about
it
there
is
a
lot
left
over
and
without
a
trough
it
will
go
bad
and
not
be
fit
for
anything
and
our
old
trough
is
broken
besides
it
too
small
first
thing
in
the
morning
off
you
go
and
ask
your
fish
to
give
us
a
new
trough
to
put
the
bread
in
early
in
the
morning
she
woke
the
old
man
again
and
he
had
to
get
up
and
go
down
to
the
seashore
he
was
very
much
afraid
because
he
thought
the
fish
would
not
take
it
kindly
but
at
dawn
just
as
the
red
sun
was
rising
out
of
the
sea
he
stood
on
the
shore
and
called
out
in
his
windy
old
voice
head
in
air
and
tail
in
sea
fish
fish
listen
to
me
and
there
in
the
morning
sunlight
was
the
golden
fish
looking
at
him
with
its
wise
eyes
i
beg
your
pardon
says
the
old
man
but
could
you
just
to
oblige
my
wife
give
us
some
sort
of
trough
to
put
the
bread
in
go
home
says
the
fish
and
down
it
goes
into
the
blue
sea
the
old
man
went
home
and
there
outside
the
hut
was
the
old
woman
looking
at
the
handsomest
bread
trough
that
ever
was
seen
on
earth
painted
it
was
with
little
flowers
in
three
colours
and
there
were
strips
of
gilding
about
its
handles
look
at
this
grumbled
the
old
woman
this
is
far
too
fine
a
trough
for
a
tumbledown
hut
like
ours
why
there
is
scarcely
a
place
in
the
roof
where
the
rain
does
not
come
through
if
we
were
to
keep
this
trough
in
such
a
hut
it
would
be
spoiled
in
a
month
you
must
go
back
to
your
fish
and
ask
it
for
a
new
hut
i
hardly
like
to
do
that
says
the
old
man
get
along
with
you
says
his
wife
if
the
fish
can
make
a
trough
like
this
a
hut
will
be
no
trouble
to
him
and
after
all
you
must
not
forget
he
owes
his
life
to
you
i
suppose
that
is
true
says
the
old
man
but
he
went
back
to
the
shore
with
a
heavy
heart
he
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
sea
and
called
out
doubtfully
head
in
air
and
tail
in
sea
fish
fish
listen
to
me
instantly
there
was
a
ripple
in
the
water
and
the
golden
fish
was
looking
at
him
with
its
wise
eyes
well
says
the
fish
my
old
woman
is
so
pleased
with
the
trough
that
she
wants
a
new
hut
to
keep
it
in
because
ours
if
you
could
only
see
it
is
really
falling
to
pieces
and
the
rain
comes
in
and
go
home
says
the
fish
the
old
fisherman
went
home
but
he
could
not
find
his
old
hut
at
all
at
first
he
thought
he
had
lost
his
way
but
then
he
saw
his
wife
and
she
was
walking
about
first
one
way
and
then
the
other
looking
at
the
finest
hut
that
god
ever
gave
a
poor
moujik
to
keep
him
from
the
rain
and
the
cold
and
the
too
great
heat
of
the
sun
it
was
built
of
sound
logs
neatly
finished
at
the
ends
and
carved
and
the
overhanging
of
the
roof
was
cut
in
patterns
so
neat
so
pretty
you
could
never
think
how
they
had
been
done
the
old
woman
looked
at
it
from
all
sides
and
the
old
man
stood
wondering
then
they
went
in
together
and
everything
within
the
hut
was
new
and
clean
there
were
a
fine
big
stove
and
strong
wooden
benches
and
a
good
table
and
a
fire
lit
in
the
stove
and
logs
ready
to
put
in
and
a
samovar
already
on
the
boil
a
fine
new
samovar
of
glittering
brass
you
would
have
thought
the
old
woman
would
have
been
satisfied
with
that
not
a
bit
of
it
you
do
know
how
to
lift
your
eyes
from
the
ground
says
she
you
do
know
what
to
ask
i
am
tired
of
being
a
peasant
woman
and
a
moujik
wife
i
was
made
for
something
better
i
want
to
be
a
lady
and
have
good
people
to
do
the
work
and
see
folk
bow
and
curtsy
to
me
when
i
meet
them
walking
abroad
go
back
at
once
to
the
fish
you
old
fool
and
ask
him
for
that
instead
of
bothering
him
for
little
trifles
like
bread
troughs
and
moujiks
huts
off
with
you
the
old
fisherman
went
back
to
the
shore
with
a
sad
heart
but
he
was
afraid
of
his
wife
and
he
dared
not
disobey
her
he
stood
on
the
shore
and
called
out
in
his
windy
old
voice
head
in
air
and
tail
in
sea
fish
fish
listen
to
me
instantly
there
was
the
golden
fish
looking
at
him
with
its
wise
eyes
well
says
the
fish
my
old
woman
wo
give
me
a
moment
peace
says
the
old
man
and
since
she
has
the
new
hut
which
is
a
fine
one
i
must
say
as
good
a
hut
as
ever
i
saw
she
wo
be
content
at
all
she
is
tired
of
being
a
peasant
wife
and
wants
to
be
a
lady
with
a
house
and
servants
and
to
see
the
good
folk
curtsy
to
her
when
she
meets
them
walking
abroad
go
home
says
the
fish
the
old
man
went
home
thinking
about
the
hut
and
how
pleasant
it
would
be
to
live
in
it
even
if
his
wife
were
a
lady
but
when
he
got
home
the
hut
had
gone
and
in
its
place
there
was
a
fine
brick
house
three
stories
high
there
were
servants
running
this
way
and
that
in
the
courtyard
there
was
a
cook
in
the
kitchen
and
there
was
his
old
woman
in
a
dress
of
rich
brocade
sitting
idle
in
a
tall
carved
chair
and
giving
orders
right
and
left
good
health
to
you
wife
says
the
old
man
ah
you
clown
that
you
are
how
dare
you
call
me
your
wife
you
see
that
i
a
lady
here
off
with
this
fellow
to
the
stables
and
see
that
he
gets
a
beating
he
wo
forget
in
a
hurry
instantly
the
servants
seized
the
old
man
by
the
collar
and
lugged
him
along
to
the
stables
there
the
grooms
treated
him
to
such
a
whipping
that
he
could
hardly
stand
on
his
feet
after
that
the
old
woman
made
him
doorkeeper
she
ordered
that
a
besom
should
be
given
him
to
clean
up
the
courtyard
and
said
that
he
was
to
have
his
meals
in
the
kitchen
a
wretched
life
the
old
man
lived
all
day
long
he
was
sweeping
up
the
courtyard
and
if
there
was
a
speck
of
dirt
to
be
seen
in
it
anywhere
he
paid
for
it
at
once
in
the
stable
under
the
whips
of
the
grooms
time
went
on
and
the
old
woman
grew
tired
of
being
only
a
lady
and
at
last
there
came
a
day
when
she
sent
into
the
yard
to
tell
the
old
man
to
come
before
her
the
poor
old
man
combed
his
hair
and
cleaned
his
boots
and
came
into
the
house
and
bowed
low
before
the
old
woman
be
off
with
you
you
old
says
she
go
and
find
your
golden
fish
and
tell
him
from
me
that
i
am
tired
of
being
a
lady
i
want
to
be
tzaritza
with
generals
and
courtiers
and
men
of
state
to
do
whatever
i
tell
them
the
old
man
went
along
to
the
seashore
glad
enough
to
be
out
of
the
courtyard
and
out
of
reach
of
the
stablemen
with
their
whips
he
came
to
the
shore
and
cried
out
in
his
windy
old
voice
head
in
air
and
tail
in
sea
fish
fish
listen
to
me
and
there
was
the
golden
fish
looking
at
him
with
its
wise
eyes
what
the
matter
now
old
man
says
the
fish
my
old
woman
is
going
on
worse
than
ever
says
the
old
fisherman
my
back
is
sore
with
the
whips
of
her
grooms
and
now
she
says
it
is
enough
for
her
to
be
a
lady
she
wants
to
be
a
tzaritza
never
you
worry
about
it
says
the
fish
go
home
and
praise
god
and
with
that
the
fish
turned
over
and
went
down
into
the
sea
the
old
man
went
home
slowly
for
he
did
not
know
what
his
wife
would
do
to
him
if
the
golden
fish
did
not
make
her
into
a
tzaritza
but
as
soon
as
he
came
near
he
heard
the
noise
of
trumpets
and
the
beating
of
drums
and
there
where
the
fine
stone
house
had
been
was
now
a
great
palace
with
a
golden
roof
behind
it
was
a
big
garden
of
flowers
that
are
fair
to
look
at
but
have
no
fruit
and
before
it
was
a
meadow
of
fine
green
grass
and
on
the
meadow
was
an
army
of
soldiers
drawn
up
in
squares
and
all
dressed
alike
and
suddenly
the
fisherman
saw
his
old
woman
in
the
gold
and
silver
dress
of
a
tzaritza
come
stalking
out
on
the
balcony
with
her
generals
and
boyars
to
hold
a
review
of
her
troops
and
the
drums
beat
and
the
trumpets
sounded
and
the
soldiers
cried
hurrah
and
the
poor
old
fisherman
found
a
dark
corner
in
one
of
the
barns
and
lay
down
in
the
straw
time
went
on
and
at
last
the
old
woman
was
tired
of
being
tzaritza
she
thought
she
was
made
for
something
better
and
one
day
she
said
to
her
chamberlain
find
me
that
ragged
old
beggar
who
is
always
hanging
about
in
the
courtyard
find
him
and
bring
him
here
the
chamberlain
told
his
officers
and
the
officers
told
the
servants
and
the
servants
looked
for
the
old
man
and
found
him
at
last
asleep
on
the
straw
in
the
corner
of
one
of
the
barns
they
took
some
of
the
dirt
off
him
and
brought
him
before
the
tzaritza
sitting
proudly
on
her
golden
throne
listen
old
fool
says
she
be
off
to
your
golden
fish
and
tell
it
i
am
tired
of
being
tzaritza
anybody
can
be
tzaritza
i
want
to
be
the
ruler
of
the
seas
so
that
all
the
waters
shall
obey
me
and
all
the
fishes
shall
be
my
servants
i
do
like
to
ask
that
said
the
old
man
trembling
what
that
she
screamed
at
him
do
you
dare
to
answer
the
tzaritza
if
you
do
not
set
off
this
minute
i
have
your
head
cut
off
and
your
body
thrown
to
the
dogs
unwillingly
the
old
man
hobbled
off
he
came
to
the
shore
and
cried
out
with
a
windy
quavering
old
voice
head
in
air
and
tail
in
sea
fish
fish
listen
to
me
nothing
happened
the
old
man
thought
of
his
wife
and
what
would
happen
to
him
if
she
were
still
tzaritza
when
he
came
home
again
he
called
out
head
in
air
and
tail
in
sea
fish
fish
listen
to
me
nothing
happened
nothing
at
all
a
third
time
with
the
tears
running
down
his
face
he
called
out
in
his
windy
creaky
quavering
old
voice
head
in
air
and
tail
in
sea
fish
fish
listen
to
me
suddenly
there
was
a
loud
noise
louder
and
louder
over
the
sea
the
sun
hid
itself
the
sea
broke
into
waves
and
the
waves
piled
themselves
one
upon
another
the
sky
and
the
sea
turned
black
and
there
was
a
great
roaring
wind
that
lifted
the
white
crests
of
the
waves
and
tossed
them
abroad
over
the
waters
the
golden
fish
came
up
out
of
the
storm
and
spoke
out
of
the
sea
what
is
it
now
says
he
in
a
voice
more
terrible
than
the
voice
of
the
storm
itself
o
fish
says
the
old
man
trembling
like
a
reed
shaken
by
the
storm
my
old
woman
is
worse
than
before
she
is
tired
of
being
tzaritza
she
wants
to
be
the
ruler
of
the
seas
so
that
all
the
waters
shall
obey
her
and
all
the
fishes
be
her
servants
the
golden
fish
said
nothing
nothing
at
all
he
turned
over
and
went
down
into
the
deep
seas
and
the
wind
from
the
sea
was
so
strong
that
the
old
man
could
hardly
stand
against
it
for
a
long
time
he
waited
afraid
to
go
home
but
at
last
the
storm
calmed
and
it
grew
towards
evening
and
he
hobbled
back
thinking
to
creep
in
and
hide
amongst
the
straw
as
he
came
near
he
listened
for
the
trumpets
and
the
drums
he
heard
nothing
except
the
wind
from
the
sea
rustling
the
little
leaves
of
birch
trees
he
looked
for
the
palace
it
was
gone
and
where
it
had
been
was
a
little
tumbledown
hut
of
earth
and
logs
it
seemed
to
the
old
fisherman
that
he
knew
the
little
hut
and
he
looked
at
it
with
joy
and
he
went
to
the
door
of
the
hut
and
there
was
sitting
his
old
woman
in
a
ragged
dress
cleaning
out
a
saucepan
and
singing
in
a
creaky
old
voice
and
this
time
she
was
glad
to
see
him
and
they
sat
down
together
on
the
bench
and
drank
tea
without
sugar
because
they
had
not
any
money
they
began
to
live
again
as
they
used
to
live
and
the
old
man
grew
happier
every
day
he
fished
and
fished
and
many
were
the
fish
that
he
caught
and
of
many
kinds
but
never
again
did
he
catch
another
golden
fish
that
could
talk
like
a
human
being
i
doubt
whether
he
would
have
said
anything
to
his
wife
about
it
even
if
he
had
caught
one
every
day
what
a
horrid
old
woman
said
maroosia
i
wonder
the
old
fisherman
forgave
her
said
ivan
i
think
he
might
have
beaten
her
a
little
said
maroosia
she
deserved
it
well
said
old
peter
supposing
we
could
have
everything
we
wanted
for
the
asking
i
wonder
how
it
would
be
perhaps
god
knew
what
he
was
doing
when
he
made
those
golden
fishes
rare
are
there
really
any
of
them
asked
vanya
well
there
was
once
one
anyhow
said
old
peter
and
then
he
rolled
his
nets
neatly
together
hung
them
on
the
fence
and
went
into
the
hut
to
make
the
dinner
and
vanya
and
maroosia
went
in
with
him
to
help
him
as
much
as
they
could
though
vanya
was
wondering
all
the
time
whether
he
could
make
a
net
and
throw
it
in
the
little
river
where
old
peter
fished
and
perhaps
pull
out
a
golden
fish
that
would
speak
to
him
with
the
voice
of
a
human
being
who
lived
in
the
skull
once
upon
a
time
a
horse
skull
lay
on
the
open
plain
it
had
been
picked
clean
by
the
ants
and
shone
white
in
the
sunlight
little
burrowing
mouse
came
along
twirling
his
whiskers
and
looking
at
the
world
he
saw
the
white
skull
and
thought
it
was
as
good
as
a
palace
he
stood
up
in
front
of
it
and
called
out
little
house
little
house
who
lives
in
the
little
house
no
one
answered
for
there
was
no
one
inside
i
will

and
the
bear
sat
down
on
the
horse
skull
and
squashed
the
whole
lot
of
them
the
way
to
tell
that
story
is
to
make
one
hand
the
skull
and
the
fingers
and
thumb
of
the
other
hand
the
animals
that
go
in
one
by
one
at
least
that
was
the
way
old
peter
told
it
and
when
it
came
to
the
end
and
the
bear
came
along
why
the
bear
was
old
peter
himself
who
squashed
both
little
hands
and
vanya
or
maroosia
whichever
it
was
all
together
in
one
big
hug
alenoushka
and
her
brother
once
upon
a
time
there
were
two
orphan
children
a
little
boy
and
a
little
girl
their
father
and
mother
were
dead
and
they
had
not
even
an
old
grandfather
to
spend
his
time
in
telling
them
stories
they
were
alone
the
little
boy
was
called
vanoushka
and
the
little
girl
name
was
alenoushka
they
set
out
together
to
walk
through
the
whole
of
the
great
wide
world
it
was
a
long
journey
they
set
out
on
and
they
did
not
think
of
any
end
to
it
but
only
of
moving
on
and
on
and
never
stopping
long
enough
in
one
place
to
be
unhappy
there
footnote
that
means
that
they
were
called
ivan
and
elena
vanoushka
and
alenoushka
are
affectionate
forms
of
these
names
they
were
travelling
one
day
over
a
broad
plain
padding
along
on
their
little
bare
feet
there
were
no
trees
on
the
plain
no
bushes
open
flat
country
as
far
as
you
could
see
and
the
great
sun
up
in
the
sky
burning
the
grass
and
making
their
throats
dry
and
the
sandy
ground
so
hot
that
they
could
scarcely
bear
to
set
their
feet
on
it
all
day
from
early
morning
they
had
been
walking
and
the
heat
grew
greater
and
greater
towards
noon
oh
said
little
vanoushka
my
throat
is
so
dry
i
want
a
drink
i
must
have
a
drink
just
a
little
drink
of
cool
water
we
must
go
on
said
alenoushka
till
we
come
to
a
well
then
we
will
drink
they
went
on
along
the
track
with
their
eyes
burning
and
their
throats
as
dry
as
sand
on
a
stove
but
presently
vanoushka
cried
out
joyfully
he
saw
a
horse
hoofmark
in
the
ground
and
it
was
full
of
water
like
a
little
well
sister
sister
says
he
the
horse
has
made
a
little
well
for
me
with
his
great
hoof
and
now
we
can
have
a
drink
and
oh
but
i
am
thirsty
not
yet
brother
says
alenoushka
if
you
drink
from
the
hoofmark
of
a
horse
you
will
turn
into
a
little
foal
and
that
would
never
do
i
am
so
very
thirsty
says
vanoushka
but
he
did
as
his
sister
told
him
and
they
walked
on
together
under
the
burning
sun
a
little
farther
on
vanoushka
saw
the
hoofmark
of
a
cow
and
there
was
water
in
it
glittering
in
the
sun
sister
sister
says
vanoushka
the
cow
has
made
a
little
well
for
me
and
now
i
can
have
a
drink
not
yet
brother
says
alenoushka
if
you
drink
from
the
hoofmark
of
a
cow
you
will
turn
into
a
little
calf
and
that
would
never
do
we
must
go
on
till
we
come
to
a
well
there
we
will
drink
and
rest
ourselves
there
will
be
trees
by
the
well
and
shadows
and
we
will
lie
down
there
by
the
quiet
water
and
cool
our
hands
and
feet
and
perhaps
our
eyes
will
stop
burning
so
they
went
on
farther
along
the
track
that
scorched
the
bare
soles
of
their
feet
and
under
the
sun
that
burned
their
heads
and
their
little
bare
necks
the
sun
was
high
in
the
sky
above
them
and
it
seemed
to
vanoushka
that
they
would
never
come
to
the
well
but
when
they
had
walked
on
and
on
and
he
was
nearly
crying
with
thirst
only
that
the
sun
had
dried
up
all
his
tears
and
burnt
them
before
they
had
time
to
come
into
his
eyes
he
saw
another
footprint
it
was
quite
a
tiny
footprint
divided
in
the
middle
the
footprint
of
a
sheep
and
in
it
was
a
little
drop
of
clear
water
sparkling
in
the
sun
he
said
nothing
to
his
sister
nothing
at
all
but
he
went
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
drank
that
water
that
little
drop
of
clear
water
to
cool
his
burning
throat
and
he
had
no
sooner
drunk
it
than
he
had
turned
into
a
little
lamb
a
little
white
lamb
said
maroosia
with
a
black
nose
said
vanya
a
little
lamb
said
old
peter
a
little
lamb
who
ran
round
and
round
alenoushka
frisking
and
leaping
with
its
little
tail
tossing
in
the
air
alenoushka
looked
round
for
her
brother
but
could
not
see
him
but
there
was
the
little
lamb
leaping
round
her
trying
to
lick
her
face
and
there
in
the
ground
was
the
print
left
by
the
sheep
foot
she
guessed
at
once
what
had
happened
and
burst
into
tears
there
was
a
hayrick
close
by
and
under
the
hayrick
alenoushka
sat
down
and
wept
the
little
lamb
seeing
her
so
sad
stood
gravely
in
front
of
her
but
not
for
long
for
he
was
a
little
lamb
and
he
could
not
help
himself
however
sad
he
felt
he
had
to
leap
and
frisk
in
the
sun
and
toss
his
little
white
tail
presently
a
fine
gentleman
came
riding
by
on
his
big
black
horse
he
stopped
when
he
came
to
the
hayrick
he
was
very
much
surprised
at
seeing
a
beautiful
little
girl
sitting
there
crying
her
eyes
out
while
a
white
lamb
frisked
this
way
and
that
and
played
before
her
and
now
and
then
ran
up
to
her
and
licked
the
tears
from
her
face
with
its
little
pink
tongue
what
is
your
name
says
the
fine
gentleman
and
why
are
you
in
trouble
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
help
you
my
name
is
alenoushka
and
this
is
my
little
brother
vanoushka
whom
i
love
and
she
told
him
the
whole
story
well
i
can
hardly
believe
all
that
says
the
fine
gentleman
but
come
with
me
and
i
will
dress
you
in
fine
clothes
and
set
silver
ornaments
in
your
hair
and
bracelets
of
gold
on
your
little
brown
wrists
and
as
for
the
lamb
he
shall
come
too
if
you
love
him
wherever
you
are
there
he
shall
be
and
you
shall
never
be
parted
from
him
and
so
alenoushka
took
her
little
brother
in
her
arms
and
the
fine
gentleman
lifted
them
up
before
him
on
the
big
black
horse
and
galloped
home
with
them
across
the
plain
to
his
big
house
not
far
from
the
river
and
when
he
got
home
he
made
a
feast
and
married
alenoushka
and
they
lived
together
so
happily
that
good
people
rejoiced
to
see
them
and
bad
ones
were
jealous
and
the
little
lamb
lived
in
the
house
and
never
grew
any
bigger
but
always
frisked
and
played
and
followed
alenoushka
wherever
she
went
and
then
one
day
when
the
fine
gentleman
had
ridden
far
away
to
the
town
to
buy
a
new
bracelet
for
alenoushka
there
came
an
old
witch
ugly
she
was
with
only
one
tooth
in
her
head
and
wicked
as
ever
went
about
the
world
doing
evil
to
decent
folk
she
begged
from
alenoushka
and
said
she
was
hungry
and
alenoushka
begged
her
to
share
her
dinner
and
she
put
a
spell
in
the
wine
that
alenoushka
drank
so
that
alenoushka
fell
ill
and
before
evening
when
the
fine
gentleman
came
riding
back
had
become
pale
pale
as
snow
and
as
thin
as
an
old
stick
my
dear
says
the
fine
gentleman
what
is
the
matter
with
you
perhaps
i
shall
be
better
says
alenoushka
well
the
next
day
the
gentleman
rode
into
the
fields
and
the
old
hag
came
again
while
he
was
out
would
you
like
me
to
cure
you
says
she
i
know
a
way
to
make
you
as
well
as
ever
you
were
plump
you
will
be
and
pretty
again
before
your
husband
comes
riding
home
and
what
must
i
do
says
alenoushka
crying
to
think
herself
so
ugly
you
must
go
to
the
river
and
bathe
this
afternoon
says
the
old
witch
i
will
be
there
and
put
a
spell
on
the
water
secretly
you
must
go
for
if
any
one
knows
whither
you
have
gone
my
spell
will
not
work
so
alenoushka
wrapped
a
shawl
about
her
head
and
slipped
out
of
the
house
and
went
to
the
river
only
the
little
lamb
vanoushka
knew
where
she
had
gone
he
followed
her
leaping
about
and
tossing
his
little
white
tail
the
old
witch
was
waiting
for
her
she
sprang
out
of
the
bushes
by
the
riverside
and
seized
alenoushka
and
tore
off
her
pretty
white
dress
and
fastened
a
heavy
stone
about
her
neck
and
threw
her
from
the
bank
into
a
deep
place
so
that
she
sank
to
the
bottom
of
the
river
then
the
old
witch
the
wicked
hag
put
on
alenoushka
pretty
white
dress
and
cast
a
spell
and
made
herself
so
like
alenoushka
to
look
at
that
nobody
could
tell
the
difference
only
the
little
lamb
had
seen
everything
that
had
happened
the
fine
gentleman
came
riding
home
in
the
evening
and
he
rejoiced
when
he
saw
his
dear
alenoushka
well
again
with
plump
pink
cheeks
and
a
smile
on
her
rosy
lips
but
the
little
lamb
knew
everything
he
was
sad
and
melancholy
and
would
not
eat
and
went
every
morning
and
every
evening
to
the
river
and
there
wandered
about
the
banks
and
cried
baa
baa
and
was
answered
by
the
sighing
of
the
wind
in
the
long
reeds
the
witch
saw
that
the
lamb
went
off
by
himself
every
morning
and
every
evening
she
watched
where
he
went
and
when
she
knew
she
began
to
hate
the
lamb
and
she
gave
orders
for
the
sticks
to
be
cut
and
the
iron
cauldron
to
be
heated
and
the
steel
knives
made
sharp
she
sent
a
servant
to
catch
the
lamb
and
she
said
to
the
fine
gentleman
who
thought
all
the
time
that
she
was
alenoushka
it
is
time
for
the
lamb
to
be
killed
and
made
into
a
tasty
stew
the
fine
gentleman
was
astonished
what
says
he
you
want
to
have
the
lamb
killed
why
you
called
it
your
brother
when
first
i
found
you
by
the
hayrick
in
the
plain
you
were
always
giving
it
caresses
and
sweet
words
you
loved
it
so
much
that
i
was
sick
of
the
sight
of
it
and
now
you
give
orders
for
its
throat
to
be
cut
truly
says
he
the
mind
of
woman
is
like
the
wind
in
summer
the
lamb
ran
away
when
he
saw
that
the
servant
had
come
to
catch
him
he
heard
the
sharpening
of
the
knives
and
had
seen
the
cutting
of
the
wood
and
the
great
cauldron
taken
from
its
place
he
was
frightened
and
he
ran
away
and
came
to
the
river
bank
where
the
wind
was
sighing
through
the
tall
reeds
and
there
he
sang
a
farewell
song
to
his
sister
thinking
he
had
not
long
to
live
the
servant
followed
the
lamb
cunningly
and
crept
near
to
catch
him
and
heard
his
little
song
this
is
what
he
sang
alenoushka
little
sister
they
are
going
to
slaughter
me
they
are
cutting
wooden
fagots
they
are
heating
iron
cauldrons
they
are
sharpening
knives
of
steel
and
alenoushka
lamenting
answered
the
lamb
from
the
bottom
of
the
river
o
my
brother
ivanoushka
a
heavy
stone
is
round
my
throat
silken
grass
grows
through
my
fingers
yellow
sand
lies
on
my
breast
the
servant
listened
and
marvelled
at
the
miracle
of
the
lamb
singing
and
the
sweet
voice
answering
him
from
the
river
he
crept
away
quietly
and
came
to
the
fine
gentleman
and
told
him
what
he
had
heard
and
they
set
out
together
to
the
river
to
watch
the
lamb
and
listen
and
see
what
was
happening
illustration
he
stepped
on
one
of
its
fiery
wings
and
pressed
it
to
the
ground
the
little
white
lamb
stood
on
the
bank
of
the
river
weeping
so
that
his
tears
fell
into
the
water
and
presently
he
sang
again
alenoushka
little
sister
they
are
going
to
slaughter
me
they
are
cutting
wooden
fagots
they
are
heating
iron
cauldrons
they
are
sharpening
knives
of
steel
and
alenoushka
answered
him
lamenting
from
the
bottom
of
the
river
o
my
brother
ivanoushka
a
heavy
stone
is
round
my
throat
silken
grass
grows
through
my
fingers
yellow
sand
lies
on
my
breast
the
fine
gentleman
heard
and
he
was
sure
that
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
his
own
dear
wife
and
he
remembered
how
she
had
loved
the
lamb
he
sent
his
servant
to
fetch
men
and
fishing
nets
and
nets
of
silk
the
men
came
running
and
they
dragged
the
river
with
fishing
nets
and
brought
their
nets
empty
to
land
then
they
tried
with
nets
of
fine
silk
and
as
they
drew
them
in
there
was
alenoushka
lying
in
the
nets
as
if
she
were
asleep
they
brought
her
to
the
bank
and
untied
the
stone
from
her
white
neck
and
washed
her
in
fresh
water
and
clothed
her
in
white
clothes
but
they
had
no
sooner
done
all
this
than
she
woke
up
more
beautiful
than
ever
she
had
been
before
though
then
she
was
pretty
enough
god
knows
she
woke
and
sprang
up
and
threw
her
arms
round
the
neck
of
the
little
white
lamb
who
suddenly
became
once
more
her
little
brother
vanoushka
who
had
been
so
thirsty
as
to
drink
water
from
the
hoofmark
of
a
sheep
and
vanoushka
laughed
and
shouted
in
the
sunshine
and
the
fine
gentleman
wept
tears
of
joy
and
they
all
praised
god
and
kissed
each
other
and
went
home
together
and
began
to
live
as
happily
as
before
even
more
happily
because
vanoushka
was
no
longer
a
lamb
but
as
soon
as
they
got
home
the
fine
gentleman
turned
the
old
witch
out
of
the
house
and
she
became
an
ugly
old
hag
and
went
away
to
the
deep
woods
shrieking
as
she
went
and
did
she
ever
come
back
again
asked
ivan
no
she
never
came
back
again
said
old
peter
once
was
enough
and
what
happened
to
vanoushka
when
he
grew
up
he
grew
up
as
handsome
as
alenoushka
was
pretty
and
he
became
a
great
hunter
and
he
married
the
sister
of
the
fine
gentleman
and
they
all
lived
happily
together
and
ate
honey
every
day
with
white
bread
and
new
milk
the
the
horse
of
power
and
the
princess
vasilissa
once
upon
a
time
a
strong
and
powerful
tzar
ruled
in
a
country
far
away
and
among
his
servants
was
a
young
archer
and
this
archer
had
a
horse
a
horse
of
power
such
a
horse
as
belonged
to
the
wonderful
men
of
long
ago
a
great
horse
with
a
broad
chest
eyes
like
fire
and
hoofs
of
iron
there
are
no
such
horses
nowadays
they
sleep
with
the
strong
men
who
rode
them
the
bogatirs
until
the
time
comes
when
russia
has
need
of
them
then
the
great
horses
will
thunder
up
from
under
the
ground
and
the
valiant
men
leap
from
the
graves
in
the
armour
they
have
worn
so
long
the
strong
men
will
sit
those
horses
of
power
and
there
will
be
swinging
of
clubs
and
thunder
of
hoofs
and
the
earth
will
be
swept
clean
from
the
enemies
of
god
and
the
tzar
so
my
grandfather
used
to
say
and
he
was
as
much
older
than
i
as
i
am
older
than
you
little
ones
and
so
he
should
know
well
one
day
long
ago
in
the
green
time
of
the
year
the
young
archer
rode
through
the
forest
on
his
horse
of
power
the
trees
were
green
there
were
little
blue
flowers
on
the
ground
under
the
trees
the
squirrels
ran
in
the
branches
and
the
hares
in
the
undergrowth
but
no
birds
sang
the
young
archer
rode
along
the
forest
path
and
listened
for
the
singing
of
the
birds
but
there
was
no
singing
the
forest
was
silent
and
the
only
noises
in
it
were
the
scratching
of
beasts
the
dropping
of
fir
cones
and
the
heavy
stamping
of
the
horse
of
power
in
the
soft
path
what
has
come
to
the
birds
said
the
young
archer
he
had
scarcely
said
this
before
he
saw
a
big
curving
feather
lying
in
the
path
before
him
the
feather
was
larger
than
a
swan
larger
than
an
eagle
it
lay
in
the
path
glittering
like
a
flame
for
the
sun
was
on
it
and
it
was
a
feather
of
pure
gold
then
he
knew
why
there
was
no
singing
in
the
forest
for
he
knew
that
the
had
flown
that
way
and
that
the
feather
in
the
path
before
him
was
a
feather
from
its
burning
breast
the
horse
of
power
spoke
and
said
leave
the
golden
feather
where
it
lies
if
you
take
it
you
will
be
sorry
for
it
and
know
the
meaning
of
fear
but
the
brave
young
archer
sat
on
the
horse
of
power
and
looked
at
the
golden
feather
and
wondered
whether
to
take
it
or
not
he
had
no
wish
to
learn
what
it
was
to
be
afraid
but
he
thought
if
i
take
it
and
bring
it
to
the
tzar
my
master
he
will
be
pleased
and
he
will
not
send
me
away
with
empty
hands
for
no
tzar
in
the
world
has
a
feather
from
the
burning
breast
of
the
and
the
more
he
thought
the
more
he
wanted
to
carry
the
feather
to
the
tzar
and
in
the
end
he
did
not
listen
to
the
words
of
the
horse
of
power
he
leapt
from
the
saddle
picked
up
the
golden
feather
of
the
mounted
his
horse
again
and
galloped
back
through
the
green
forest
till
he
came
to
the
palace
of
the
tzar
he
went
into
the
palace
and
bowed
before
the
tzar
and
said
o
tzar
i
have
brought
you
a
feather
of
the
the
tzar
looked
gladly
at
the
feather
and
then
at
the
young
archer
thank
you
says
he
but
if
you
have
brought
me
a
feather
of
the
you
will
be
able
to
bring
me
the
bird
itself
i
should
like
to
see
it
a
feather
is
not
a
fit
gift
to
bring
to
the
tzar
bring
the
bird
itself
or
i
swear
by
my
sword
your
head
shall
no
longer
sit
between
your
shoulders
the
young
archer
bowed
his
head
and
went
out
bitterly
he
wept
for
he
knew
now
what
it
was
to
be
afraid
he
went
out
into
the
courtyard
where
the
horse
of
power
was
waiting
for
him
tossing
its
head
and
stamping
on
the
ground
master
says
the
horse
of
power
why
do
you
weep
the
tzar
has
told
me
to
bring
him
the
and
no
man
on
earth
can
do
that
says
the
young
archer
and
he
bowed
his
head
on
his
breast
i
told
you
says
the
horse
of
power
that
if
you
took
the
feather
you
would
learn
the
meaning
of
fear
well
do
not
be
frightened
yet
and
do
not
weep
the
trouble
is
not
now
the
trouble
lies
before
you
go
to
the
tzar
and
ask
him
to
have
a
hundred
sacks
of
maize
scattered
over
the
open
field
and
let
this
be
done
at
midnight
the
young
archer
went
back
into
the
palace
and
begged
the
tzar
for
this
and
the
tzar
ordered
that
at
midnight
a
hundred
sacks
of
maize
should
be
scattered
in
the
open
field
next
morning
at
the
first
redness
in
the
sky
the
young
archer
rode
out
on
the
horse
of
power
and
came
to
the
open
field
the
ground
was
scattered
all
over
with
maize
in
the
middle
of
the
field
stood
a
great
oak
with
spreading
boughs
the
young
archer
leapt
to
the
ground
took
off
the
saddle
and
let
the
horse
of
power
loose
to
wander
as
he
pleased
about
the
field
then
he
climbed
up
into
the
oak
and
hid
himself
among
the
green
boughs
the
sky
grew
red
and
gold
and
the
sun
rose
suddenly
there
was
a
noise
in
the
forest
round
the
field
the
trees
shook
and
swayed
and
almost
fell
there
was
a
mighty
wind
the
sea
piled
itself
into
waves
with
crests
of
foam
and
the
came
flying
from
the
other
side
of
the
world
huge
and
golden
and
flaming
in
the
sun
it
flew
dropped
down
with
open
wings
into
the
field
and
began
to
eat
the
maize
the
horse
of
power
wandered
in
the
field
this
way
he
went
and
that
but
always
he
came
a
little
nearer
to
the
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
horse
he
came
close
up
to
the
and
then
suddenly
stepped
on
one
of
its
spreading
fiery
wings
and
pressed
it
heavily
to
the
ground
the
bird
struggled
flapping
mightily
with
its
fiery
wings
but
it
could
not
get
away
the
young
archer
slipped
down
from
the
tree
bound
the
with
three
strong
ropes
swung
it
on
his
back
saddled
the
horse
and
rode
to
the
palace
of
the
tzar
the
young
archer
stood
before
the
tzar
and
his
back
was
bent
under
the
great
weight
of
the
and
the
broad
wings
of
the
bird
hung
on
either
side
of
him
like
fiery
shields
and
there
was
a
trail
of
golden
feathers
on
the
floor
the
young
archer
swung
the
magic
bird
to
the
foot
of
the
throne
before
the
tzar
and
the
tzar
was
glad
because
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
no
tzar
had
seen
the
flung
before
him
like
a
wild
duck
caught
in
a
snare
the
tzar
looked
at
the
and
laughed
with
pride
then
he
lifted
his
eyes
and
looked
at
the
young
archer
and
says
he
as
you
have
known
how
to
take
the
you
will
know
how
to
bring
me
my
bride
for
whom
i
have
long
been
waiting
in
the
land
of
never
on
the
very
edge
of
the
world
where
the
red
sun
rises
in
flame
from
behind
the
sea
lives
the
princess
vasilissa
i
will
marry
none
but
her
bring
her
to
me
and
i
will
reward
you
with
silver
and
gold
but
if
you
do
not
bring
her
then
by
my
sword
your
head
will
no
longer
sit
between
your
shoulders
the
young
archer
wept
bitter
tears
and
went
out
into
the
courtyard
where
the
horse
of
power
was
stamping
the
ground
with
its
hoofs
of
iron
and
tossing
its
thick
mane
master
why
do
you
weep
asked
the
horse
of
power
the
tzar
has
ordered
me
to
go
to
the
land
of
never
and
to
bring
back
the
princess
vasilissa
do
not
weep
do
not
grieve
the
trouble
is
not
yet
the
trouble
is
to
come
go
to
the
tzar
and
ask
him
for
a
silver
tent
with
a
golden
roof
and
for
all
kinds
of
food
and
drink
to
take
with
us
on
the
journey
the
young
archer
went
in
and
asked
the
tzar
for
this
and
the
tzar
gave
him
a
silver
tent
with
silver
hangings
and
a
roof
and
every
kind
of
rich
wine
and
the
tastiest
of
foods
then
the
young
archer
mounted
the
horse
of
power
and
rode
off
to
the
land
of
never
on
and
on
he
rode
many
days
and
nights
and
came
at
last
to
the
edge
of
the
world
where
the
red
sun
rises
in
flame
from
behind
the
deep
blue
sea
on
the
shore
of
the
sea
the
young
archer
reined
in
the
horse
of
power
and
the
heavy
hoofs
of
the
horse
sank
in
the
sand
he
shaded
his
eyes
and
looked
out
over
the
blue
water
and
there
was
the
princess
vasilissa
in
a
little
silver
boat
rowing
with
golden
oars
the
young
archer
rode
back
a
little
way
to
where
the
sand
ended
and
the
green
world
began
there
he
loosed
the
horse
to
wander
where
he
pleased
and
to
feed
on
the
green
grass
then
on
the
edge
of
the
shore
where
the
green
grass
ended
and
grew
thin
and
the
sand
began
he
set
up
the
shining
tent
with
its
silver
hangings
and
its
gold
embroidered
roof
in
the
tent
he
set
out
the
tasty
dishes
and
the
rich
flagons
of
wine
which
the
tzar
had
given
him
and
he
sat
himself
down
in
the
tent
and
began
to
regale
himself
while
he
waited
for
the
princess
vasilissa
the
princess
vasilissa
dipped
her
golden
oars
in
the
blue
water
and
the
little
silver
boat
moved
lightly
through
the
dancing
waves
she
sat
in
the
little
boat
and
looked
over
the
blue
sea
to
the
edge
of
the
world
and
there
between
the
golden
sand
and
the
green
earth
she
saw
the
tent
standing
silver
and
gold
in
the
sun
she
dipped
her
oars
and
came
nearer
to
see
it
the
better
the
nearer
she
came
the
fairer
seemed
the
tent
and
at
last
she
rowed
to
the
shore
and
grounded
her
little
boat
on
the
golden
sand
and
stepped
out
daintily
and
came
up
to
the
tent
she
was
a
little
frightened
and
now
and
again
she
stopped
and
looked
back
to
where
the
silver
boat
lay
on
the
sand
with
the
blue
sea
beyond
it
the
young
archer
said
not
a
word
but
went
on
regaling
himself
on
the
pleasant
dishes
he
had
set
out
there
in
the
tent
at
last
the
princess
vasilissa
came
up
to
the
tent
and
looked
in
the
young
archer
rose
and
bowed
before
her
says
he
to
you
princess
be
so
kind
as
to
come
in
and
take
bread
and
salt
with
me
and
taste
my
foreign
wines
and
the
princess
vasilissa
came
into
the
tent
and
sat
down
with
the
young
archer
and
ate
sweetmeats
with
him
and
drank
his
health
in
a
golden
goblet
of
the
wine
the
tzar
had
given
him
now
this
wine
was
heavy
and
the
last
drop
from
the
goblet
had
no
sooner
trickled
down
her
little
slender
throat
than
her
eyes
closed
against
her
will
once
twice
and
again
ah
me
says
the
princess
it
is
as
if
the
night
itself
had
perched
on
my
eyelids
and
yet
it
is
but
noon
and
the
golden
goblet
dropped
to
the
ground
from
her
little
fingers
and
she
leant
back
on
a
cushion
and
fell
instantly
asleep
if
she
had
been
beautiful
before
she
was
lovelier
still
when
she
lay
in
that
deep
sleep
in
the
shadow
of
the
tent
quickly
the
young
archer
called
to
the
horse
of
power
lightly
he
lifted
the
princess
in
his
strong
young
arms
swiftly
he
leapt
with
her
into
the
saddle
like
a
feather
she
lay
in
the
hollow
of
his
left
arm
and
slept
while
the
iron
hoofs
of
the
great
horse
thundered
over
the
ground
they
came
to
the
tzar
palace
and
the
young
archer
leapt
from
the
horse
of
power
and
carried
the
princess
into
the
palace
great
was
the
joy
of
the
tzar
but
it
did
not
last
for
long
go
sound
the
trumpets
for
our
wedding
he
said
to
his
servants
let
all
the
bells
be
rung
the
bells
rang
out
and
the
trumpets
sounded
and
at
the
noise
of
the
horns
and
the
ringing
of
the
bells
the
princess
vasilissa
woke
up
and
looked
about
her
what
is
this
ringing
of
bells
says
she
and
this
noise
of
trumpets
and
where
oh
where
is
the
blue
sea
and
my
little
silver
boat
with
its
golden
oars
and
the
princess
put
her
hand
to
her
eyes
the
blue
sea
is
far
away
says
the
tzar
and
for
your
little
silver
boat
i
give
you
a
golden
throne
the
trumpets
sound
for
our
wedding
and
the
bells
are
ringing
for
our
joy
but
the
princess
turned
her
face
away
from
the
tzar
and
there
was
no
wonder
in
that
for
he
was
old
and
his
eyes
were
not
kind
and
she
looked
with
love
at
the
young
archer
and
there
was
no
wonder
in
that
either
for
he
was
a
young
man
fit
to
ride
the
horse
of
power
the
tzar
was
angry
with
the
princess
vasilissa
but
his
anger
was
as
useless
as
his
joy
why
princess
says
he
will
you
not
marry
me
and
forget
your
blue
sea
and
your
silver
boat
in
the
middle
of
the
deep
blue
sea
lies
a
great
stone
says
the
princess
and
under
that
stone
is
hidden
my
wedding
dress
if
i
can
not
wear
that
dress
i
will
marry
nobody
at
all
instantly
the
tzar
turned
to
the
young
archer
who
was
waiting
before
the
throne
ride
swiftly
back
says
he
to
the
land
of
never
where
the
red
sun
rises
in
flame
there
do
you
hear
what
the
princess
says
a
great
stone
lies
in
the
middle
of
the
sea
under
that
stone
is
hidden
her
wedding
dress
ride
swiftly
bring
back
that
dress
or
by
my
sword
your
head
shall
no
longer
sit
between
your
shoulders
the
young
archer
wept
bitter
tears
and
went
out
into
the
courtyard
where
the
horse
of
power
was
waiting
for
him
champing
its
golden
bit
there
is
no
way
of
escaping
death
this
time
he
said
master
why
do
you
weep
asked
the
horse
of
power
the
tzar
has
ordered
me
to
ride
to
the
land
of
never
to
fetch
the
wedding
dress
of
the
princess
vasilissa
from
the
bottom
of
the
deep
blue
sea
besides
the
dress
is
wanted
for
the
tzar
wedding
and
i
love
the
princess
myself
what
did
i
tell
you
says
the
horse
of
power
i
told
you
that
there
would
be
trouble
if
you
picked
up
the
golden
feather
from
the
burning
breast
well
do
not
be
afraid
the
trouble
is
not
yet
the
trouble
is
to
come
up
into
the
saddle
with
you
and
away
for
the
wedding
dress
of
the
princess
vasilissa
the
young
archer
leapt
into
the
saddle
and
the
horse
of
power
with
his
thundering
hoofs
carried
him
swiftly
through
the
green
forests
and
over
the
bare
plains
till
they
came
to
the
edge
of
the
world
to
the
land
of
never
where
the
red
sun
rises
in
flame
from
behind
the
deep
blue
sea
there
they
rested
at
the
very
edge
of
the
sea
the
young
archer
looked
sadly
over
the
wide
waters
but
the
horse
of
power
tossed
its
mane
and
did
not
look
at
the
sea
but
on
the
shore
this
way
and
that
it
looked
and
saw
at
last
a
huge
lobster
moving
slowly
sideways
along
the
golden
sand
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
lobster
and
it
was
a
giant
among
lobsters
the
tzar
of
all
the
lobsters
and
it
moved
slowly
along
the
shore
while
the
horse
of
power
moved
carefully
and
as
if
by
accident
until
it
stood
between
the
lobster
and
the
sea
then
when
the
lobster
came
close
by
the
horse
of
power
lifted
an
iron
hoof
and
set
it
firmly
on
the
lobster
tail
you
will
be
the
death
of
me
screamed
the
lobster
as
well
he
might
with
the
heavy
foot
of
the
horse
of
power
pressing
his
tail
into
the
sand
let
me
live
and
i
will
do
whatever
you
ask
of
me
very
well
says
the
horse
of
power
we
will
let
you
live
and
he
slowly
lifted
his
foot
but
this
is
what
you
shall
do
for
us
in
the
middle
of
the
blue
sea
lies
a
great
stone
and
under
that
stone
is
hidden
the
wedding
dress
of
the
princess
vasilissa
bring
it
here
the
lobster
groaned
with
the
pain
in
his
tail
then
he
cried
out
in
a
voice
that
could
be
heard
all
over
the
deep
blue
sea
and
the
sea
was
disturbed
and
from
all
sides
lobsters
in
thousands
made
their
way
towards
the
bank
and
the
huge
lobster
that
was
the
oldest
of
them
all
and
the
tzar
of
all
the
lobsters
that
live
between
the
rising
and
the
setting
of
the
sun
gave
them
the
order
and
sent
them
back
into
the
sea
and
the
young
archer
sat
on
the
horse
of
power
and
waited
after
a
little
time
the
sea
was
disturbed
again
and
the
lobsters
in
their
thousands
came
to
the
shore
and
with
them
they
brought
a
golden
casket
in
which
was
the
wedding
dress
of
the
princess
vasilissa
they
had
taken
it
from
under
the
great
stone
that
lay
in
the
middle
of
the
sea
the
tzar
of
all
the
lobsters
raised
himself
painfully
on
his
bruised
tail
and
gave
the
casket
into
the
hands
of
the
young
archer
and
instantly
the
horse
of
power
turned
himself
about
and
galloped
back
to
the
palace
of
the
tzar
far
far
away
at
the
other
side
of
the
green
forests
and
beyond
the
treeless
plains
the
young
archer
went
into
the
palace
and
gave
the
casket
into
the
hands
of
the
princess
and
looked
at
her
with
sadness
in
his
eyes
and
she
looked
at
him
with
love
then
she
went
away
into
an
inner
chamber
and
came
back
in
her
wedding
dress
fairer
than
the
spring
itself
great
was
the
joy
of
the
tzar
the
wedding
feast
was
made
ready
and
the
bells
rang
and
flags
waved
above
the
palace
the
tzar
held
out
his
hand
to
the
princess
and
looked
at
her
with
his
old
eyes
but
she
would
not
take
his
hand
no
says
she
i
will
marry
nobody
until
the
man
who
brought
me
here
has
done
penance
in
boiling
water
instantly
the
tzar
turned
to
his
servants
and
ordered
them
to
make
a
great
fire
and
to
fill
a
great
cauldron
with
water
and
set
it
on
the
fire
and
when
the
water
should
be
at
its
hottest
to
take
the
young
archer
and
throw
him
into
it
to
do
penance
for
having
taken
the
princess
vasilissa
away
from
the
land
of
never
there
was
no
gratitude
in
the
mind
of
that
tzar
swiftly
the
servants
brought
wood
and
made
a
mighty
fire
and
on
it
they
laid
a
huge
cauldron
of
water
and
built
the
fire
round
the
walls
of
the
cauldron
the
fire
burned
hot
and
the
water
steamed
the
fire
burned
hotter
and
the
water
bubbled
and
seethed
they
made
ready
to
take
the
young
archer
to
throw
him
into
the
cauldron
oh
misery
thought
the
young
archer
why
did
i
ever
take
the
golden
feather
that
had
fallen
from
the
burning
breast
why
did
i
not
listen
to
the
wise
words
of
the
horse
of
power
and
he
remembered
the
horse
of
power
and
he
begged
the
tzar
o
lord
tzar
i
do
not
complain
i
shall
presently
die
in
the
heat
of
the
water
on
the
fire
suffer
me
before
i
die
once
more
to
see
my
horse
let
him
see
his
horse
says
the
princess
very
well
says
the
tzar
say
to
your
horse
for
you
will
not
ride
him
again
but
let
your
farewells
be
short
for
we
are
waiting
the
young
archer
crossed
the
courtyard
and
came
to
the
horse
of
power
who
was
scraping
the
ground
with
his
iron
hoofs
farewell
my
horse
of
power
says
the
young
archer
i
should
have
listened
to
your
words
of
wisdom
for
now
the
end
is
come
and
we
shall
never
more
see
the
green
trees
pass
above
us
and
the
ground
disappear
beneath
us
as
we
race
the
wind
between
the
earth
and
the
sky
why
so
says
the
horse
of
power
the
tzar
has
ordered
that
i
am
to
be
boiled
to
death
thrown
into
that
cauldron
that
is
seething
on
the
great
fire
fear
not
says
the
horse
of
power
for
the
princess
vasilissa
has
made
him
do
this
and
the
end
of
these
things
is
better
than
i
thought
go
back
and
when
they
are
ready
to
throw
you
in
the
cauldron
do
you
run
boldly
and
leap
yourself
into
the
boiling
water
the
young
archer
went
back
across
the
courtyard
and
the
servants
made
ready
to
throw
him
into
the
cauldron
are
you
sure
that
the
water
is
boiling
says
the
princess
vasilissa
it
bubbles
and
seethes
said
the
servants
let
me
see
for
myself
says
the
princess
and
she
went
to
the
fire
and
waved
her
hand
above
the
cauldron
and
some
say
there
was
something
in
her
hand
and
some
say
there
was
not
it
is
boiling
says
she
and
the
servants
laid
hands
on
the
young
archer
but
he
threw
them
from
him
and
ran
and
leapt
boldly
before
them
all
into
the
very
middle
of
the
cauldron
twice
he
sank
below
the
surface
borne
round
with
the
bubbles
and
foam
of
the
boiling
water
then
he
leapt
from
the
cauldron
and
stood
before
the
tzar
and
the
princess
he
had
become
so
beautiful
a
youth
that
all
who
saw
cried
aloud
in
wonder
this
is
a
miracle
says
the
tzar
and
the
tzar
looked
at
the
beautiful
young
archer
and
thought
of
himself
of
his
age
of
his
bent
back
and
his
gray
beard
and
his
toothless
gums
i
too
will
become
beautiful
thinks
he
and
he
rose
from
his
throne
and
clambered
into
the
cauldron
and
was
boiled
to
death
in
a
moment
and
the
end
of
the
story
they
buried
the
tzar
and
made
the
young
archer
tzar
in
his
place
he
married
the
princess
vasilissa
and
lived
many
years
with
her
in
love
and
good
fellowship
and
he
built
a
golden
stable
for
the
horse
of
power
and
never
forgot
what
he
owed
to
him
the
hunter
and
his
wife
it
sometimes
happened
that
the
two
children
asked
too
many
questions
even
for
old
peter
though
he
was
the
kindest
old
russian
peasant
who
ever
was
a
grandfather
sometimes
he
was
busy
sometimes
he
was
tired
and
really
could
not
think
of
the
right
answer
sometimes
he
did
not
know
the
right
answer
and
once
when
vanya
asked
him
why
the
sun
was
hot
and
his
sister
maroosia
went
on
and
on
asking
if
the
sun
was
a
fire
who
lit
it
and
if
it
was
burning
why
did
it
burn
out
old
peter
grumbled
that
he
would
not
answer
any
more
for
a
moment
the
two
children
were
quiet
and
then
maroosia
asked
one
more
question
old
peter
looked
up
from
the
net
he
was
mending
maroosia
my
dear
he
said
you
had
better
watch
the
tip
of
your
tongue
or
perhaps
when
you
are
grown
up
and
have
a
husband
the
same
thing
will
happen
to
you
that
happened
to
the
wife
of
the
huntsman
who
saw
a
snake
in
a
burning
oh
tell
us
what
happened
to
her
said
maroosia
that
is
another
question
said
old
peter
but
i
tell
you
and
then
perhaps
you
wo
ask
any
more
and
will
give
my
old
head
a
rest
and
then
he
told
them
the
story
of
the
hunter
and
his
wife
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
hunter
who
went
out
into
the
forest
to
shoot
game
he
had
a
wife
and
two
dogs
his
wife
was
for
ever
asking
questions
so
that
he
was
glad
to
get
away
from
her
into
the
forest
and
she
did
not
like
dogs
and
said
they
were
always
bringing
dirt
into
the
house
with
their
muddy
paws
so
that
the
dogs
were
glad
to
get
away
into
the
forest
with
the
hunter
one
day
the
hunter
and
the
two
dogs
wandered
all
day
through
the
deep
woods
and
never
got
a
sight
of
a
bird
no
they
never
even
saw
a
hare
all
day
long
they
wandered
on
and
saw
nothing
the
hunter
had
not
fired
a
cartridge
he
did
not
want
to
go
home
and
have
to
answer
his
wife
questions
about
why
he
had
an
empty
bag
so
he
went
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
thick
forest
and
suddenly
as
it
grew
towards
evening
the
sharp
smell
of
burning
wood
floated
through
the
trees
and
the
hunter
looking
about
him
saw
the
flickering
of
a
fire
he
made
his
way
towards
it
and
found
a
clearing
in
the
forest
and
a
wood
pile
in
the
middle
of
it
and
it
was
burning
so
fiercely
that
he
could
scarcely
come
near
it
and
this
was
the
marvel
that
in
the
middle
of
the
blazing
timbers
was
sitting
a
great
snake
curled
round
and
round
upon
itself
and
waving
its
head
above
the
flames
as
soon
as
it
saw
the
hunter
it
called
out
in
a
loud
hissing
voice
to
come
near
he
went
as
near
as
he
could
shading
his
face
from
the
heat
my
good
man
says
the
snake
pull
me
out
of
the
fire
and
you
shall
understand
the
talk
of
the
beasts
and
the
songs
of
the
birds
i
be
happy
to
help
you
says
the
hunter
but
how
for
the
flames
are
so
hot
that
i
can
not
reach
you
put
the
barrel
of
your
gun
into
the
fire
and
i
crawl
out
along
it
the
hunter
put
the
barrel
of
his
long
gun
into
the
flames
and
instantly
the
snake
wound
itself
about
it
and
so
escaped
out
of
the
fire
thank
you
my
good
man
says
the
snake
you
shall
know
henceforward
the
language
of
all
living
things
but
one
thing
you
must
remember
you
must
not
tell
any
one
of
this
for
if
you
tell
you
will
die
the
death
and
man
only
dies
once
and
that
will
be
an
end
of
your
life
and
your
knowledge
then
the
snake
slipped
off
along
the
ground
and
almost
before
the
hunter
knew
it
was
going
it
was
gone
and
he
never
saw
it
again
well
he
went
on
with
the
two
dogs
looking
for
something
to
shoot
at
and
when
the
dark
night
fell
he
was
still
far
from
home
away
in
the
deep
forest
i
am
tired
he
thought
and
perhaps
there
will
be
birds
stirring
in
the
early
morning
i
will
sleep
the
night
here
and
try
my
luck
at
sunrise
he
made
a
fire
of
twigs
and
broken
branches
and
lay
down
beside
it
together
with
his
dogs
he
had
scarcely
lain
down
to
sleep
when
he
heard
the
dogs
talking
together
and
calling
each
other
brother
he
understood
every
word
they
said
well
brother
says
the
first
you
sleep
here
and
look
after
our
master
while
i
run
home
to
look
after
the
house
and
yard
it
will
soon
be
one
and
when
the
master
is
away
that
is
the
time
for
thieves
off
with
you
brother
and
god
be
with
you
says
the
second
and
the
hunter
heard
the
first
dog
go
bounding
away
through
the
undergrowth
while
the
second
lay
still
with
its
head
between
its
paws
watching
its
master
blinking
at
the
fire
early
in
the
morning
the
hunter
was
awakened
by
the
noise
of
the
dog
pushing
through
the
brushwood
on
its
way
back
he
heard
how
the
dogs
greeted
each
other
well
and
how
are
you
brother
says
the
first
finely
says
the
second
and
how
yourself
finely
too
did
the
night
pass
well
well
enough
thanks
be
to
god
but
with
you
brother
how
was
it
at
home
oh
badly
i
ran
home
and
the
mistress
when
she
sees
me
sings
out
the
devil
are
you
doing
here
without
your
master
well
your
supper
and
she
threw
me
a
crust
of
bread
burnt
to
a
black
cinder
i
snuffed
it
and
snuffed
it
but
as
for
eating
it
it
was
burnt
through
no
dog
alive
could
have
made
a
meal
of
it
and
with
that
she
ups
with
a
poker
and
beats
me
brother
she
counted
all
my
ribs
and
nearly
broke
each
one
of
them
but
at
night
later
on
just
as
i
thought
thieves
came
into
the
yard
and
were
going
to
clear
out
the
barn
and
the
larder
but
i
let
loose
such
a
howl
and
leapt
upon
them
so
vicious
and
angry
that
they
had
little
thought
to
spare
for
other
people
goods
and
had
all
they
could
do
to
get
away
whole
themselves
and
so
i
spent
the
night
the
hunter
heard
all
that
the
dogs
said
and
kept
it
in
mind
wait
a
bit
my
good
woman
says
he
and
see
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
when
i
get
home
that
morning
his
luck
was
good
and
he
came
home
with
a
couple
of
hares
and
three
or
four
woodcock
mistress
says
he
to
his
wife
who
was
standing
in
the
doorway
master
says
she
last
night
one
of
the
dogs
came
home
it
did
says
she
and
how
did
you
feed
it
feed
it
my
love
says
she
i
gave
it
a
whole
basin
of
milk
and
crumbled
a
loaf
of
bread
for
it
you
lie
you
old
witch
says
the
hunter
you
gave
it
nothing
but
a
burnt
crust
and
you
beat
it
with
the
poker
the
old
woman
was
so
surprised
that
she
let
the
truth
out
of
her
mouth
before
she
knew
she
says
to
her
husband
how
on
earth
did
you
know
all
that
i
wo
tell
you
says
the
hunter
tell
me
tell
me
begs
the
old
woman
just
like
maroosia
when
she
wants
to
know
too
much
i
ca
tell
you
says
the
hunter
it
forbidden
me
to
tell
tell
me
dear
one
says
she
truly
i
ca
tell
me
my
little
pigeon
if
i
tell
you
i
shall
die
the
death
rubbish
my
dearest
only
tell
me
but
i
shall
die
just
tell
me
that
one
little
thing
you
wo
die
for
that
and
so
she
bothered
him
and
bothered
him
until
he
thought
nothing
to
be
done
if
a
woman
sets
her
mind
on
a
thing
i
better
die
and
get
it
over
at
once
so
he
put
on
a
clean
white
shirt
and
lay
down
on
the
bench
in
the
corner
under
the
sacred
images
and
made
all
ready
for
his
death
and
was
just
going
to
tell
his
wife
the
whole
truth
about
the
snake
and
the
and
how
he
knew
the
language
of
all
living
things
but
just
then
there
was
a
great
clucking
in
the
yard
and
some
of
the
hens
ran
into
the
cottage
and
after
them
came
the
cock
scolding
first
one
and
then
another
and
boasting
that
the
way
to
deal
with
you
says
the
cock
and
the
hunter
lying
there
in
his
white
shirt
ready
to
die
heard
and
understood
every
word
yes
says
the
cock
as
he
drove
the
hens
about
the
room
you
see
i
am
not
such
a
fool
as
our
master
here
who
does
not
know
how
to
keep
a
single
wife
in
order
why
i
have
thirty
of
you
and
more
and
the
whole
lot
hear
from
me
sharp
enough
if
they
do
not
do
as
i
say
as
soon
as
the
hunter
heard
this
he
made
up
his
mind
to
be
a
fool
no
longer
he
jumped
up
from
the
bench
and
took
his
whip
and
gave
his
wife
such
a
beating
that
she
never
asked
him
another
question
to
this
day
and
she
has
never
yet
learnt
how
it
was
that
he
knew
what
she
did
in
the
hut
while
he
was
away
in
the
forest
yes
said
maroosia
but
then
she
was
a
bad
woman
and
besides
my
husband
would
never
call
me
an
old
witch
old
witch
said
vanya
and
bolted
out
of
the
hut
with
maroosia
after
him
and
so
old
peter
was
left
in
peace
the
three
men
of
power
evening
midnight
and
sunrise
long
ago
there
lived
a
king
and
he
had
three
daughters
the
loveliest
in
all
the
world
he
loved
them
so
well
that
he
built
a
palace
for
them
underground
lest
the
rough
winds
should
blow
on
them
or
the
red
sun
scorch
their
delicate
faces
a
wonderful
palace
it
was
down
there
underground
with
fountains
and
courts
and
lamps
burning
and
precious
stones
glittering
in
the
light
of
the
lamps
and
the
three
lovely
princesses
grew
up
in
that
palace
underground
and
knew
no
other
light
but
that
of
the
coloured
lanterns
and
had
never
seen
the
broad
world
that
lies
open
under
the
sun
by
day
and
under
the
stars
by
night
indeed
they
did
not
know
that
there
was
a
world
outside
those
glittering
walls
above
that
shining
ceiling
carved
and
gilded
and
set
with
precious
stones
but
it
so
happened
that
among
the
books
that
were
given
them
to
read
was
one
in
which
was
written
of
the
world
how
the
sun
shines
in
the
sky
how
trees
grow
green
how
the
grass
waves
in
the
wind
and
the
leaves
whisper
together
how
the
rivers
flow
between
their
green
banks
and
through
the
flowery
meadows
until
they
come
to
the
blue
sea
that
joins
the
earth
and
the
sky
they
read
in
that
book
of
towns
of
churches
with
gilded
and
painted
domes
of
the
brown
wooden
huts
of
the
peasants
of
the
great
forests
of
the
ships
on
the
rivers
and
of
the
long
roads
with
the
folk
moving
on
them
this
way
and
that
about
the
world
and
when
the
king
came
to
see
them
as
he
was
used
to
do
they
asked
him
father
is
it
true
that
there
is
a
garden
in
the
world
yes
said
the
king
and
green
grass
yes
said
the
king
and
little
shining
flowers
why
yes
said
the
king
wondering
and
stroking
his
silver
beard
and
the
three
lovely
princesses
all
begged
him
at
once
oh
your
majesty
our
own
little
father
whom
we
love
let
us
out
to
see
this
world
let
us
out
just
so
that
we
may
see
this
garden
and
walk
in
it
on
the
green
grass
and
see
the
shining
flowers
the
king
turned
his
head
away
and
tried
not
to
listen
to
them
but
what
could
he
do
they
were
the
loveliest
princesses
in
the
world
and
when
they
begged
him
just
to
let
them
walk
in
the
garden
he
could
see
the
tears
in
their
eyes
and
after
all
he
thought
there
were
high
walls
to
the
garden
so
he
called
up
his
army
and
set
soldiers
all
round
the
garden
and
a
hundred
soldiers
to
each
gate
so
that
no
one
should
come
in
and
then
he
let
the
princesses
come
up
from
their
underground
palace
and
step
out
into
the
sunshine
in
the
garden
with
ten
nurses
and
maids
to
each
princess
to
see
that
no
harm
came
to
her
the
princesses
stepped
out
into
the
garden
under
the
blue
sky
shading
their
eyes
at
first
because
they
had
never
before
been
in
the
golden
sunlight
soon
they
were
taking
hands
and
running
this
way
and
that
along
the
garden
paths
and
over
the
green
grass
and
gathering
posies
of
shining
flowers
to
set
in
their
girdles
and
to
shame
their
golden
crowns
and
the
king
sat
and
watched
them
with
love
in
his
eyes
and
was
glad
to
see
how
happy
they
were
and
after
all
he
thought
what
with
the
high
walls
and
the
soldiers
standing
to
arms
nothing
could
get
in
to
hurt
them
illustration
it
caught
up
the
princesses
and
carried
them
up
into
the
air
but
just
as
he
had
quieted
his
old
heart
a
strong
whirlwind
came
down
out
of
the
blue
sky
tearing
up
trees
and
throwing
them
aside
and
lifting
the
roofs
from
the
houses
but
it
did
not
touch
the
palace
roofs
shining
green
in
the
sunlight
and
it
plucked
no
trees
from
the
garden
it
raged
this
way
and
that
and
then
with
its
swift
whirling
arms
it
caught
up
the
three
lovely
princesses
and
carried
them
up
into
the
air
over
the
high
walls
and
over
the
heads
of
the
guarding
soldiers
for
a
moment
the
king
saw
them
his
daughters
the
three
lovely
princesses
spinning
round
and
round
as
if
they
were
dancing
in
the
sky
a
moment
later
they
were
no
more
than
little
whirling
specks
like
dust
in
the
sunlight
and
then
they
were
out
of
sight
and
the
king
and
all
the
maids
and
nurses
were
alone
in
the
empty
garden
the
noise
of
the
wind
had
gone
the
soldiers
did
not
dare
to
speak
the
only
sound
in
the
king
ears
was
the
sobbing
and
weeping
of
the
maids
and
nurses
the
king
called
his
generals
and
made
them
send
the
soldiers
in
all
directions
over
the
country
to
bring
back
the
princesses
if
the
whirlwind
should
tire
and
set
them
again
upon
the
ground
the
soldiers
went
to
the
very
boundaries
of
the
kingdom
but
they
came
back
as
they
went
not
one
of
them
had
seen
the
three
lovely
princesses
then
the
king
called
together
all
his
faithful
servants
and
promised
a
great
reward
to
any
one
who
should
bring
news
of
the
three
princesses
it
was
the
same
with
the
servants
as
with
the
soldiers
far
and
wide
they
galloped
out
slowly
one
by
one
they
rode
back
with
bent
heads
on
tired
horses
not
one
of
them
had
seen
the
daughters
then
the
king
called
a
grand
council
of
his
wise
boyars
and
men
of
state
they
all
sat
round
and
listened
as
the
king
told
his
tale
and
asked
if
one
of
them
would
not
undertake
the
task
of
finding
and
rescuing
the
three
princesses
the
wind
has
not
set
them
down
within
the
boundaries
of
my
kingdom
and
now
god
knows
they
may
be
in
the
power
of
wicked
men
or
worse
he
said
he
would
give
one
of
the
princesses
in
marriage
to
any
one
who
could
follow
where
the
wind
went
and
bring
his
daughters
back
yes
and
besides
he
would
make
him
the
richest
man
in
the
kingdom
but
the
boyars
and
the
wise
men
of
state
sat
round
in
silence
he
asked
them
one
by
one
they
were
all
silent
and
afraid
for
they
were
boyars
and
wise
men
of
state
and
not
one
of
them
would
undertake
to
follow
the
whirlwind
and
rescue
the
three
princesses
the
king
wept
bitter
tears
i
see
he
said
i
have
no
friends
about
me
in
the
palace
my
soldiers
can
not
my
servants
can
not
and
my
boyars
and
wise
men
will
not
bring
back
my
three
sweet
maids
whom
i
love
better
than
my
kingdom
and
with
that
he
sent
heralds
throughout
the
kingdom
to
announce
the
news
and
to
ask
if
there
were
none
among
the
common
folk
the
moujiks
the
simple
folk
like
us
who
would
put
his
hand
to
the
work
of
rescuing
the
three
lovely
princesses
since
not
one
of
the
boyars
and
wise
men
was
willing
to
do
it
now
at
that
time
in
a
certain
village
lived
a
poor
widow
and
she
had
three
sons
strong
men
true
bogatirs
and
men
of
power
all
three
had
been
born
in
a
single
night
the
eldest
at
evening
the
middle
one
at
midnight
and
the
youngest
just
as
the
sky
was
lightening
with
the
dawn
for
this
reason
they
were
called
evening
midnight
and
sunrise
evening
was
dusky
with
brown
eyes
and
hair
midnight
was
dark
with
eyes
and
hair
as
black
as
charcoal
while
sunrise
had
hair
golden
as
the
sun
and
eyes
blue
as
morning
sky
and
all
three
were
as
strong
as
any
of
the
strong
men
and
mighty
bogatirs
who
have
shaken
this
land
of
russia
with
their
tread
as
soon
as
the
king
word
had
been
proclaimed
in
the
village
the
three
brothers
asked
for
their
mother
blessing
which
she
gave
them
kissing
them
on
the
forehead
and
on
both
cheeks
then
they
made
ready
for
the
journey
and
rode
off
to
the
capital
evening
on
his
horse
of
dusky
brown
midnight
on
his
black
horse
and
sunrise
on
his
horse
that
was
as
white
as
clouds
in
summer
they
came
to
the
capital
and
as
they
rode
through
the
streets
everybody
stopped
to
look
at
them
and
all
the
pretty
young
women
waved
handkerchiefs
at
the
windows
but
the
three
brothers
looked
neither
to
right
nor
left
but
straight
before
them
and
they
rode
to
the
palace
of
the
king
they
came
to
the
king
bowed
low
before
him
and
said
may
you
live
for
many
years
o
king
we
have
come
to
you
not
for
feasting
but
for
service
let
us
o
king
ride
out
to
rescue
your
three
princesses
god
give
you
success
my
good
young
men
says
the
king
what
are
your
names
we
are
three
brothers
evening
midnight
and
sunrise
what
will
you
have
to
take
with
you
on
the
road
for
ourselves
o
king
we
want
nothing
only
do
not
leave
our
mother
in
poverty
for
she
is
old
the
king
sent
for
the
old
woman
their
mother
and
gave
her
a
home
in
his
palace
and
made
her
eat
and
drink
at
his
table
and
gave
her
new
boots
made
by
his
own
cobblers
and
new
clothes
sewn
by
the
very
sempstresses
who
were
used
to
make
dresses
for
the
three
daughters
of
the
king
who
were
the
loveliest
princesses
in
the
world
and
had
been
carried
away
by
the
whirlwind
no
old
woman
in
russia
was
better
looked
after
than
the
mother
of
the
three
young
bogatirs
and
men
of
power
evening
midnight
and
sunrise
while
they
were
away
on
their
adventure
seeking
the
king
daughters
the
young
men
rode
out
on
their
journey
a
month
they
rode
together
two
months
and
in
the
third
month
they
came
to
a
broad
desert
plain
where
there
were
no
towns
no
villages
no
farms
and
not
a
human
being
to
be
seen
they
rode
on
over
the
sand
through
the
rank
grass
over
the
stony
wastes
at
last
on
the
other
side
of
that
desolate
plain
they
came
to
a
thick
forest
they
found
a
path
through
the
thick
undergrowth
and
rode
along
that
path
together
into
the
very
heart
of
the
forest
and
there
alone
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
they
came
to
a
hut
with
a
railed
yard
and
a
shed
full
of
cattle
and
sheep
they
called
out
with
their
strong
young
voices
and
were
answered
by
the
lowing
of
the
cattle
the
bleating
of
the
sheep
and
the
strong
wind
in
the
tops
of
the
great
trees
they
rode
through
the
railed
yard
and
came
to
the
hut
evening
leant
from
his
brown
horse
and
knocked
on
the
window
there
was
no
answer
they
forced
open
the
door
and
found
no
one
at
all
well
brothers
says
evening
let
us
make
ourselves
at
home
let
us
stay
here
awhile
we
have
been
riding
three
months
let
us
rest
and
then
ride
farther
we
shall
deal
better
with
our
adventure
if
we
come
to
it
as
fresh
men
and
not
dusty
and
weary
from
the
long
road
the
others
agreed
they
tied
up
their
horses
fed
them
drew
water
from
the
well
and
gave
them
to
drink
and
then
tired
out
they
went
into
the
hut
said
their
prayers
to
god
and
lay
down
to
sleep
with
their
weapons
close
to
their
hands
like
true
bogatirs
and
men
of
power
in
the
morning
the
youngest
brother
sunrise
said
to
the
eldest
brother
evening
midnight
and
i
are
going
hunting
and
you
shall
rest
here
and
see
what
sort
of
dinner
you
can
give
us
when
we
come
back
very
well
says
evening
but
i
shall
go
hunting
and
one
of
you
shall
stay
here
and
cook
the
dinner
nobody
made
bones
about
that
and
so
evening
stood
at
the
door
of
the
hut
while
the
others
rode
off
midnight
on
his
black
horse
and
sunrise
on
his
horse
white
as
a
summer
cloud
they
rode
off
into
the
forest
and
disappeared
among
the
green
trees
evening
watched
them
out
of
sight
and
then
without
thinking
twice
about
what
he
was
doing
went
out
into
the
yard
picked
out
the
finest
sheep
he
could
see
caught
it
killed
it
skinned
it
cleaned
it
and
set
it
in
a
cauldron
on
the
stove
so
as
to
be
ready
and
hot
whenever
his
brothers
should
come
riding
back
from
the
forest
as
soon
as
that
was
done
evening
lay
down
on
the
broad
bench
to
rest
himself
he
had
scarcely
lain
down
before
there
were
a
knocking
and
a
rattling
and
a
stumbling
and
the
door
opened
and
in
walked
a
little
man
a
yard
high
with
a
beard
seven
yards
long
flowing
out
behind
him
over
both
his
shoulders
he
looked
round
angrily
and
saw
evening
who
yawned
and
sat
up
on
the
bench
and
began
chuckling
at
the
sight
of
him
the
little
man
screamed
out
what
are
you
chuckling
about
how
dare
you
play
the
master
in
my
house
how
dare
you
kill
my
best
sheep
evening
answered
him
laughing
grow
a
little
bigger
and
it
wo
be
so
hard
to
see
you
down
there
till
then
it
will
be
better
for
you
to
keep
a
civil
tongue
in
your
head
the
little
man
was
angry
before
but
now
he
was
angrier
what
he
screamed
i
am
little
am
i
well
see
what
little
does
and
with
that
he
grabbed
an
old
crust
of
bread
leapt
on
shoulders
and
began
beating
him
over
the
head
yes
and
the
little
fellow
was
so
strong
he
beat
evening
till
he
was
half
dead
and
was
blind
in
one
eye
and
could
not
see
out
of
the
other
then
when
he
was
tired
he
threw
evening
under
the
bench
took
the
sheep
out
of
the
cauldron
gobbled
it
up
in
a
few
mouthfuls
and
when
he
had
done
went
off
again
into
the
forest
footnote
the
little
man
was
really
one
arshin
high
and
his
beard
was
seven
arshins
long
an
arshin
is
of
a
yard
so
any
one
who
knows
decimals
can
tell
exactly
how
high
the
little
man
was
and
the
precise
length
of
his
beard
when
evening
came
to
his
senses
again
he
bound
up
his
head
with
a
dishcloth
and
lay
on
the
ground
and
groaned
midnight
and
sunrise
rode
back
on
the
black
horse
and
the
white
and
came
to
the
hut
where
they
found
their
brother
groaning
on
the
ground
unable
to
see
out
of
his
eyes
and
with
a
dishcloth
round
his
head
what
are
you
tied
up
like
that
for
they
asked
and
where
is
our
dinner
evening
was
ashamed
to
tell
them
the
truth
how
he
had
been
thumped
about
with
a
crust
of
bread
by
a
little
fellow
only
a
yard
high
he
moaned
and
said
o
my
brothers
i
made
a
fire
in
the
stove
and
fell
ill
from
the
great
heat
in
this
little
hut
my
head
ached
all
day
i
lay
senseless
and
could
neither
boil
nor
roast
i
thought
my
head
would
burst
with
the
heat
and
my
brains
fly
beyond
the
seventh
world
next
day
sunrise
went
hunting
with
evening
whose
head
was
still
bound
up
in
a
dishcloth
and
hurting
so
sorely
that
he
could
hardly
see
midnight
stayed
at
home
it
was
his
turn
to
see
to
the
dinner
sunrise
rode
out
on
his
horse
and
evening
on
his
dusky
brown
midnight
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
hut
watched
them
disappear
among
the
green
trees
and
then
set
about
getting
the
dinner
he
lit
the
fire
but
was
careful
not
to
make
it
too
hot
then
he
went
into
the
yard
caught
the
very
fattest
of
the
sheep
killed
it
skinned
it
cleaned
it
cut
it
up
and
set
it
on
the
stove
then
when
all
was
ready
he
lay
down
on
the
bench
and
rested
himself
but
before
he
had
lain
there
long
there
were
a
knocking
a
stamping
a
rattling
a
grumbling
and
in
came
the
little
old
man
one
yard
high
with
a
beard
seven
yards
long
and
without
wasting
words
the
little
fellow
leapt
on
the
shoulders
of
the
bogatir
and
set
to
beating
him
and
thumping
him
first
on
one
side
of
his
head
and
then
on
the
other
he
gave
him
such
a
banging
that
he
very
nearly
made
an
end
of
him
altogether
then
the
little
fellow
ate
up
the
whole
of
the
sheep
in
a
few
mouthfuls
and
went
off
angrily
into
the
forest
with
his
long
white
beard
flowing
behind
him
midnight
tied
up
his
head
with
a
handkerchief
and
lay
down
under
the
bench
groaning
and
groaning
unable
to
put
his
head
to
the
ground
or
even
to
lay
it
in
the
crook
of
his
arm
it
was
so
bruised
by
the
beating
given
it
by
the
little
old
man
in
the
evening
the
brothers
rode
back
and
found
midnight
groaning
under
the
bench
with
his
head
bound
up
in
a
handkerchief
evening
looked
at
him
and
said
nothing
perhaps
he
was
thinking
of
his
own
bruised
head
which
was
still
tied
up
in
a
dishcloth
what
the
matter
with
you
says
sunrise
there
never
was
such
another
stove
as
this
says
midnight
i
no
sooner
lit
it
than
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
hut
were
on
fire
my
head
nearly
burst
it
aching
now
and
as
for
your
dinner
why
not
been
able
to
put
a
hand
to
anything
all
day
evening
chuckled
to
himself
but
sunrise
only
said
that
bad
brother
but
you
shall
go
hunting
and
i
stay
at
home
and
see
what
i
can
do
with
the
stove
and
so
on
the
third
day
the
two
elder
brothers
went
hunting
midnight
on
his
black
horse
and
evening
on
his
horse
of
dusky
brown
sunrise
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
hut
and
saw
them
disappear
under
the
green
trees
the
sun
shone
on
his
golden
curls
and
his
blue
eyes
were
like
the
sky
itself
there
never
was
such
another
bogatir
as
he
he
went
into
the
hut
and
lit
the
stove
then
he
went
out
into
the
yard
chose
the
best
sheep
he
could
find
killed
it
skinned
it
cleaned
it
cut
it
up
and
set
it
on
the
stove
he
made
everything
ready
and
then
lay
down
on
the
bench
before
he
had
lain
there
very
long
he
heard
a
stumping
a
thumping
a
knocking
a
rattling
a
grumbling
a
rumbling
sunrise
leaped
up
from
the
bench
and
looked
out
through
the
window
of
the
hut
there
in
the
yard
was
the
little
old
man
one
yard
high
with
a
beard
seven
yards
long
he
was
carrying
a
whole
haystack
on
his
head
and
a
great
tub
of
water
in
his
arms
he
came
into
the
middle
of
the
yard
and
set
down
his
tub
to
water
all
the
beasts
he
set
down
the
haystack
and
scattered
the
hay
about
all
the
cattle
and
the
sheep
came
together
to
eat
and
to
drink
and
the
little
man
stood
and
counted
them
he
counted
the
oxen
he
counted
the
goats
and
then
he
counted
the
sheep
he
counted
them
once
and
his
eyes
began
to
flash
he
counted
them
twice
and
he
began
to
grind
his
teeth
he
counted
them
a
third
time
made
sure
that
one
was
missing
and
then
he
flew
into
a
violent
rage
rushed
across
the
yard
and
into
the
hut
and
gave
sunrise
a
terrific
blow
on
the
head
sunrise
shook
his
head
as
if
a
fly
had
settled
on
it
then
he
jumped
suddenly
and
caught
the
end
of
the
long
beard
of
the
little
old
man
and
set
to
pulling
him
this
way
and
that
round
and
round
the
hut
as
if
his
beard
was
a
rope
phew
how
the
little
man
roared
sunrise
laughed
and
tugged
him
this
way
and
that
and
mocked
him
crying
out
if
you
do
not
know
the
ford
it
is
better
not
to
go
into
the
water
meaning
that
the
little
fellow
had
begun
to
beat
him
without
finding
out
who
was
the
stronger
the
little
old
man
one
yard
high
with
a
beard
seven
yards
long
began
to
pray
and
to
beg
o
man
of
power
o
great
and
mighty
bogatir
have
mercy
upon
me
do
not
kill
me
leave
me
my
soul
to
repent
with
sunrise
laughed
and
dragged
the
little
fellow
out
into
the
yard
whirled
him
round
at
the
end
of
his
beard
and
brought
him
to
a
great
oak
trunk
that
lay
on
the
ground
then
with
a
heavy
iron
wedge
he
fixed
the
end
of
the
little
man
beard
firmly
in
the
oaken
trunk
and
leaving
the
little
man
howling
and
lamenting
went
back
to
the
hut
set
it
in
order
again
saw
that
the
sheep
was
cooking
as
it
should
and
then
lay
down
in
peace
to
wait
for
the
coming
of
his
brothers
evening
and
midnight
rode
home
leapt
from
their
horses
and
came
into
the
hut
to
see
how
the
little
man
had
dealt
with
their
brother
they
could
hardly
believe
their
eyes
when
they
saw
him
alive
and
well
without
a
bruise
lying
comfortably
on
the
bench
he
sat
up
and
laughed
in
their
faces
well
brothers
says
he
come
along
with
me
into
the
yard
and
i
think
i
can
show
you
that
headache
of
yours
it
a
good
deal
stronger
than
it
is
big
but
for
the
time
being
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
it
for
it
fastened
to
an
oak
timber
that
all
three
of
us
together
could
not
lift
he
got
up
and
went
into
the
yard
evening
and
midnight
followed
him
with
shamed
faces
but
when
they
came
to
the
oaken
timber
the
little
man
was
not
there
long
ago
he
had
torn
himself
free
and
run
away
into
the
forest
but
half
his
beard
was
left
wedged
in
the
trunk
and
sunrise
pointed
to
that
and
said
tell
me
brothers
was
it
the
heat
of
the
stove
that
gave
you
your
headaches
or
had
this
long
beard
something
to
do
with
it
the
brothers
grew
red
and
laughed
and
told
him
the
whole
truth
meanwhile
sunrise
had
been
looking
at
the
end
of
the
beard
the
end
of
the
half
beard
that
was
left
and
he
saw
that
it
had
been
torn
out
by
the
roots
and
that
drops
of
blood
from
the
little
man
chin
showed
the
way
he
had
gone
quickly
the
brothers
went
back
to
the
hut
and
ate
up
the
sheep
then
they
leapt
on
their
horses
and
rode
off
into
the
green
forest
following
the
drops
of
blood
that
had
fallen
from
the
little
chin
for
three
days
they
rode
through
the
green
forest
until
at
last
the
red
drops
of
the
trail
led
them
to
a
deep
pit
a
black
hole
in
the
earth
hidden
by
thick
bushes
and
going
far
down
into
the
underworld
sunrise
left
his
brothers
to
guard
the
hole
while
he
went
off
into
the
forest
and
gathered
bast
and
twisted
it
and
made
a
strong
rope
and
brought
it
to
the
mouth
of
the
pit
and
asked
his
brothers
to
lower
him
down
he
made
a
loop
in
the
rope
his
brothers
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks
and
he
kissed
them
back
then
he
sat
in
the
loop
and
evening
and
midnight
lowered
him
down
into
the
darkness
down
and
down
he
went
swinging
in
the
dark
till
he
came
into
a
world
under
the
world
with
a
light
that
was
neither
that
of
the
sun
nor
of
the
moon
nor
of
the
stars
he
stepped
from
the
loop
in
the
rope
of
twisted
bast
and
set
out
walking
through
the
underworld
going
whither
his
eyes
led
him
for
he
found
no
more
drops
of
blood
nor
any
other
traces
of
the
little
old
man
he
walked
and
walked
and
came
at
last
to
a
palace
of
copper
green
and
ruddy
in
the
strange
light
he
went
into
that
palace
and
there
came
to
meet
him
in
the
copper
halls
a
maiden
whose
cheeks
were
redder
than
the
aloe
and
whiter
than
the
snow
she
was
the
youngest
daughter
of
the
king
and
the
loveliest
of
the
three
princesses
who
were
the
loveliest
in
all
the
world
sweetly
she
curtsied
to
sunrise
as
he
stood
there
with
his
golden
hair
and
his
eyes
blue
as
the
sky
at
morning
and
sweetly
she
asked
him
how
have
you
come
hither
my
brave
young
man
of
your
own
will
or
against
it
your
father
has
sent
to
rescue
you
and
your
sisters
she
bade
him
sit
at
the
table
and
gave
him
food
and
brought
him
a
little
flask
of
the
water
of
strength
strong
you
are
says
she
but
not
strong
enough
for
what
is
before
you
drink
this
and
your
strength
will
be
greater
than
it
is
for
you
will
need
all
the
strength
you
have
and
can
win
if
you
are
to
rescue
us
and
live
sunrise
looked
in
her
sweet
eyes
and
drank
the
water
of
strength
in
a
single
draught
and
felt
gigantic
power
forcing
its
way
throughout
his
body
now
thought
he
let
come
what
may
instantly
a
violent
wind
rushed
through
the
copper
palace
and
the
princess
trembled
the
snake
that
holds
me
here
is
coming
says
she
he
is
flying
hither
on
his
strong
wings
she
took
the
great
hand
of
the
bogatir
in
her
little
fingers
and
drew
him
to
another
room
and
hid
him
there
the
copper
palace
rocked
in
the
wind
and
there
flew
into
the
great
hall
a
huge
snake
with
three
heads
the
snake
hissed
loudly
and
called
out
in
a
whistling
voice
i
smell
the
smell
of
a
russian
soul
what
visitor
have
you
here
how
could
any
one
come
here
said
the
princess
you
have
been
flying
over
russia
there
you
smelt
russian
souls
and
the
smell
is
still
in
your
nostrils
so
that
you
think
you
smell
them
here
it
is
true
said
the
snake
i
have
been
flying
over
russia
i
have
flown
far
let
me
eat
and
drink
for
i
am
both
hungry
and
thirsty
all
this
time
sunrise
was
watching
from
the
other
room
the
princess
brought
meat
and
drink
to
the
snake
and
in
the
drink
she
put
a
philtre
of
sleep
the
snake
ate
and
drank
and
began
to
feel
sleepy
he
coiled
himself
up
in
rings
laid
his
three
heads
in
the
lap
of
the
princess
told
her
to
scratch
them
for
him
and
dropped
into
a
deep
sleep
the
princess
called
sunrise
and
the
bogatir
rushed
in
swung
his
glittering
sword
three
times
round
his
golden
head
and
cut
off
all
three
heads
of
the
snake
it
was
like
felling
three
oak
trees
at
a
single
blow
then
he
made
a
great
fire
of
wood
and
threw
upon
it
the
body
of
the
snake
and
when
it
was
burnt
up
scattered
the
ashes
over
the
open
country
and
now
fare
you
well
says
sunrise
to
the
princess
but
she
threw
her
arms
about
his
neck
fare
you
well
says
he
i
go
to
seek
your
sisters
as
soon
as
i
have
found
them
i
will
come
back
and
at
that
she
let
him
go
he
walked
on
further
through
the
underworld
and
came
at
last
to
a
palace
of
silver
gleaming
in
the
strange
light
he
went
in
there
and
was
met
with
sweet
words
and
kindness
by
the
second
of
the
three
lovely
princesses
in
that
palace
he
killed
a
snake
with
six
heads
the
princess
begged
him
to
stay
but
he
told
her
he
had
yet
to
find
her
eldest
sister
at
that
she
wished
him
the
help
of
god
and
he
left
her
and
went
on
further
he
walked
and
walked
and
came
at
last
to
a
palace
of
gold
glittering
in
the
light
of
the
underworld
all
happened
as
in
the
other
palaces
the
eldest
of
the
three
daughters
of
the
king
met
him
with
courtesy
and
kindness
and
he
killed
a
snake
with
twelve
heads
and
freed
the
princess
from
her
imprisonment
the
princess
rejoiced
and
thanked
sunrise
and
set
about
her
packing
to
go
home
and
this
was
the
way
of
her
packing
she
went
out
into
the
broad
courtyard
and
waved
a
scarlet
handkerchief
and
instantly
the
whole
palace
golden
and
glittering
and
the
kingdom
belonging
to
it
became
little
little
little
till
it
went
into
a
little
golden
egg
the
princess
tied
the
egg
in
a
corner
of
her
handkerchief
and
set
out
with
sunrise
to
join
her
sisters
and
go
home
to
her
father
her
sisters
did
their
packing
in
the
same
way
the
silver
palace
and
its
kingdom
were
packed
by
the
second
sister
into
a
little
silver
egg
and
when
they
came
to
the
copper
palace
the
youngest
of
the
three
lovely
princesses
clapped
her
hands
and
kissed
sunrise
on
both
his
cheeks
and
waved
a
scarlet
handkerchief
and
instantly
the
copper
palace
and
its
kingdom
were
packed
into
a
little
copper
egg
shining
ruddy
and
green
and
so
sunrise
and
the
three
daughters
of
the
king
came
to
the
foot
of
the
deep
hole
down
which
he
had
come
into
the
underworld
and
there
was
the
rope
hanging
with
the
loop
at
its
end
and
they
sat
in
the
loop
and
evening
and
midnight
pulled
them
up
one
by
one
rejoicing
together
then
the
three
brothers
took
each
of
them
a
princess
with
him
on
his
horse
and
they
all
rode
together
back
to
the
old
king
telling
talcs
and
singing
songs
as
they
went
the
princess
from
the
golden
palace
rode
with
evening
on
his
horse
of
dusky
brown
the
princess
from
the
silver
palace
rode
with
midnight
on
his
horse
as
black
as
charcoal
but
the
princess
from
the
copper
palace
the
youngest
of
them
all
rode
with
sunrise
on
his
horse
white
as
a
summer
cloud
merry
was
the
journey
through
the
green
forest
and
gladly
they
rode
over
the
open
plain
till
they
came
at
last
to
the
palace
of
her
father
there
was
the
old
king
sitting
melancholy
alone
when
the
three
brothers
with
the
princesses
rode
into
the
courtyard
of
the
palace
the
old
king
was
so
glad
that
he
laughed
and
cried
at
the
same
time
and
his
tears
ran
down
his
beard
ah
me
says
the
old
king
i
am
old
and
you
young
men
have
brought
my
daughters
back
from
the
very
world
under
the
world
safer
they
will
be
if
they
have
you
to
guard
them
even
than
they
were
in
the
palace
i
had
built
for
them
underground
but
i
have
only
one
kingdom
and
three
daughters
do
not
trouble
about
that
laughed
the
three
princesses
and
they
all
rode
out
together
into
the
open
country
and
there
the
princesses
broke
their
eggs
one
after
the
other
and
there
were
the
palaces
of
silver
copper
and
gold
with
the
kingdoms
belonging
to
them
and
the
cattle
and
the
sheep
and
the
goats
there
was
a
kingdom
for
each
of
the
brothers
then
they
made
a
great
feast
and
had
three
weddings
all
together
and
the
old
king
sat
with
the
mother
of
the
three
strong
men
and
men
of
power
the
noble
bogatirs
evening
midnight
and
sunrise
sitting
at
his
side
great
was
the
feasting
loud
were
the
songs
and
the
king
made
sunrise
his
heir
so
that
some
day
he
would
wear
his
crown
but
little
did
sunrise
think
of
that
he
thought
of
nothing
but
the
youngest
princess
and
little
she
thought
of
it
for
she
had
no
eyes
but
for
sunrise
and
merrily
they
lived
together
in
the
copper
palace
and
happily
they
rode
together
on
the
horse
that
was
as
white
as
clouds
in
summer
salt
one
evening
when
they
were
sitting
round
the
table
after
their
supper
old
peter
asked
the
children
what
story
they
would
like
to
hear
vanya
asked
whether
there
were
any
stories
left
which
they
had
not
already
heard
why
said
old
peter
you
have
heard
scarcely
any
of
the
stories
for
there
is
a
story
to
be
told
about
everything
in
the
world
about
everything
grandfather
asked
vanya
about
everything
said
old
peter
about
the
sky
and
the
thunder
and
the
dogs
and
the
flies
and
the
birds
and
the
trees
and
the
milk
there
is
a
story
about
everyone
of
those
things
i
know
something
there
is
a
story
about
said
vanya
and
what
that
asked
old
peter
smiling
in
his
beard
salt
said
vanya
there
ca
be
a
story
about
salt
he
put
the
tip
of
his
finger
into
the
little
box
of
salt
on
the
table
and
then
he
touched
his
tongue
with
his
finger
to
taste
but
of
course
there
is
a
story
about
salt
said
old
peter
tell
it
us
said
maroosia
and
presently
when
his
pipe
had
been
lit
twice
and
gone
out
old
peter
began
once
upon
a
time
there
were
three
brothers
and
their
father
was
a
great
merchant
who
sent
his
ships
far
over
the
sea
and
traded
here
and
there
in
countries
the
names
of
which
i
being
an
old
man
can
never
rightly
call
to
mind
well
the
names
of
the
two
elder
brothers
do
not
matter
but
the
youngest
was
called
ivan
the
ninny
because
he
was
always
playing
and
never
working
and
if
there
was
a
silly
thing
to
do
why
off
he
went
and
did
it
and
so
when
the
brothers
grew
up
the
father
sent
the
two
elder
ones
off
each
in
a
fine
ship
laden
with
gold
and
jewels
and
rings
and
bracelets
and
laces
and
silks
and
sticks
with
little
bits
of
silver
hammered
into
their
handles
and
spoons
with
patterns
of
blue
and
red
and
everything
else
you
can
think
of
that
costs
too
much
to
buy
but
he
made
ivan
the
ninny
stay
at
home
and
did
not
give
him
a
ship
at
all
ivan
saw
his
brothers
go
sailing
off
over
the
sea
on
a
summer
morning
to
make
their
fortunes
and
come
back
rich
men
and
then
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
wanted
to
work
and
do
something
useful
he
went
to
his
father
and
kissed
his
hand
and
he
kissed
the
hand
of
his
little
old
mother
and
he
begged
his
father
to
give
him
a
ship
so
that
he
could
try
his
fortune
like
his
brothers
but
you
have
never
done
a
wise
thing
in
your
life
and
no
one
could
count
all
the
silly
things
you
done
if
he
spent
a
hundred
days
in
counting
said
his
father
true
said
ivan
but
now
i
am
going
to
be
wise
and
sail
the
sea
and
come
back
with
something
in
my
pockets
to
show
that
i
am
not
a
ninny
any
longer
give
me
just
a
little
ship
father
mine
just
a
little
ship
for
myself
give
him
a
little
ship
said
the
mother
he
may
not
be
a
ninny
after
all
very
well
said
his
father
i
will
give
him
a
little
ship
but
i
am
not
going
to
waste
good
roubles
by
giving
him
a
rich
cargo
give
me
any
cargo
you
like
said
ivan
so
his
father
gave
him
a
little
ship
a
little
old
ship
and
a
cargo
of
rags
and
scraps
and
things
that
were
not
fit
for
anything
but
to
be
thrown
away
and
he
gave
him
a
crew
of
ancient
old
sailormen
who
were
past
work
and
ivan
went
on
board
and
sailed
away
at
sunset
like
the
ninny
he
was
and
the
feeble
ancient
old
sailormen
pulled
up
the
ragged
dirty
sails
and
away
they
went
over
the
sea
to
learn
what
fortune
good
or
bad
god
had
in
mind
for
a
crew
of
old
men
with
a
ninny
for
a
master
the
fourth
day
after
they
set
sail
there
came
a
great
wind
over
the
sea
the
feeble
old
men
did
the
best
they
could
with
the
ship
but
the
old
torn
sails
tore
from
the
masts
and
the
wind
did
what
it
pleased
and
threw
the
little
ship
on
an
unknown
island
away
in
the
middle
of
the
sea
then
the
wind
dropped
and
left
the
little
ship
on
the
beach
and
ivan
the
ninny
and
his
ancient
old
men
like
good
russians
praising
god
that
they
were
still
alive
well
children
said
ivan
for
he
knew
how
to
talk
to
sailors
do
you
stay
here
and
mend
the
sails
and
make
new
ones
out
of
the
rags
we
carry
as
cargo
while
i
go
inland
and
see
if
there
is
anything
that
could
be
of
use
to
us
so
the
ancient
old
sailormen
sat
on
deck
with
their
legs
crossed
and
made
sails
out
of
rags
of
torn
scraps
of
old
brocades
of
soiled
embroidered
shawls
of
all
the
rubbish
that
they
had
with
them
for
a
cargo
you
never
saw
such
sails
the
tide
came
up
and
floated
the
ship
and
they
threw
out
anchors
at
bow
and
stern
and
sat
there
in
the
sunlight
making
sails
and
patching
them
and
talking
of
the
days
when
they
were
young
all
this
while
ivan
the
ninny
went
walking
off
into
the
island
now
in
the
middle
of
that
island
was
a
high
mountain
a
high
mountain
it
was
and
so
white
that
when
he
came
near
it
ivan
the
ninny
began
thinking
of
sheepskin
coats
although
it
was
midsummer
and
the
sun
was
hot
in
the
sky
the
trees
were
green
round
about
but
there
was
nothing
growing
on
the
mountain
at
all
it
was
just
a
great
white
mountain
piled
up
into
the
sky
in
the
middle
of
a
green
island
ivan
walked
a
little
way
up
the
white
slopes
of
the
mountain
and
then
because
he
felt
thirsty
he
thought
he
would
let
a
little
snow
melt
in
his
mouth
he
took
some
in
his
fingers
and
stuffed
it
in
quickly
enough
it
came
out
again
i
can
tell
you
for
the
mountain
was
not
made
of
snow
but
of
good
russian
salt
and
if
you
want
to
try
what
a
mouthful
of
salt
is
like
you
may
no
thank
you
grandfather
the
children
said
hurriedly
together
old
peter
went
on
with
his
tale
ivan
the
ninny
did
not
stop
to
think
twice
the
salt
was
so
clean
and
shone
so
brightly
in
the
sunlight
he
just
turned
round
and
ran
back
to
the
shore
and
called
out
to
his
ancient
old
sailormen
and
told
them
to
empty
everything
they
had
on
board
over
into
the
sea
over
it
all
went
rags
and
tags
and
rotten
timbers
till
the
little
ship
was
as
empty
as
a
soup
bowl
after
supper
and
then
those
ancient
old
men
were
set
to
work
carrying
salt
from
the
mountain
and
taking
it
on
board
the
little
ship
and
stowing
it
away
below
deck
till
there
was
not
room
for
another
grain
ivan
the
ninny
would
have
liked
to
take
the
whole
mountain
but
there
was
not
room
in
the
little
ship
and
for
that
the
ancient
old
sailormen
thanked
god
because
their
backs
ached
and
their
old
legs
were
weak
and
they
said
they
would
have
died
if
they
had
had
to
carry
any
more
then
they
hoisted
up
the
new
sails
they
had
patched
together
out
of
the
rags
and
scraps
of
shawls
and
old
brocades
and
they
sailed
away
once
more
over
the
blue
sea
and
the
wind
stood
fair
and
they
sailed
before
it
and
the
ancient
old
sailors
rested
their
backs
and
told
old
tales
and
took
turn
and
turn
about
at
the
rudder
and
after
many
days
sailing
they
came
to
a
town
with
towers
and
churches
and
painted
roofs
all
set
on
the
side
of
a
hill
that
sloped
down
into
the
sea
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
was
a
quiet
harbour
and
they
sailed
in
there
and
moored
the
ship
and
hauled
down
their
patchwork
sails
ivan
the
ninny
went
ashore
and
took
with
him
a
little
bag
of
clean
white
salt
to
show
what
kind
of
goods
he
had
for
sale
and
he
asked
his
way
to
the
palace
of
the
tzar
of
that
town
he
came
to
the
palace
and
went
in
and
bowed
to
the
ground
before
the
tzar
who
are
you
says
the
tzar
i
great
lord
am
a
russian
merchant
and
here
in
a
bag
is
some
of
my
merchandise
and
i
beg
your
leave
to
trade
with
your
subjects
in
this
town
let
me
see
what
is
in
the
bag
says
the
tzar
ivan
the
ninny
took
a
handful
from
the
bag
and
showed
it
to
the
tzar
what
is
it
says
the
tzar
good
russian
salt
says
ivan
the
ninny
now
in
that
country
they
had
never
heard
of
salt
and
the
tzar
looked
at
the
salt
and
he
looked
at
ivan
and
he
laughed
why
this
says
he
is
nothing
but
white
dust
and
that
we
can
pick
up
for
nothing
the
men
of
my
town
have
no
need
to
trade
with
you
you
must
be
a
ninny
ivan
grew
very
red
for
he
knew
what
his
father
used
to
call
him
he
was
ashamed
to
say
anything
so
he
bowed
to
the
ground
and
went
away
out
of
the
palace
but
when
he
was
outside
he
thought
to
himself
i
wonder
what
sort
of
salt
they
use
in
these
parts
if
they
do
not
know
good
russian
salt
when
they
see
it
i
will
go
to
the
kitchen
so
he
went
round
to
the
back
door
of
the
palace
and
put
his
head
into
the
kitchen
and
said
i
am
very
tired
may
i
sit
down
here
and
rest
a
little
while
come
in
says
one
of
the
cooks
but
you
must
sit
just
there
and
not
put
even
your
little
finger
in
the
way
of
us
for
we
are
the
tzar
cooks
and
we
are
in
the
middle
of
making
ready
his
dinner
and
the
cook
put
a
stool
in
a
corner
out
of
the
way
and
ivan
slipped
in
round
the
door
and
sat
down
in
the
corner
and
looked
about
him
there
were
seven
cooks
at
least
boiling
and
baking
and
stewing
and
toasting
and
roasting
and
frying
and
as
for
scullions
they
were
as
thick
as
cockroaches
dozens
of
them
running
to
and
fro
tumbling
over
each
other
and
helping
the
cooks
ivan
the
ninny
sat
on
his
stool
with
his
legs
tucked
under
him
and
the
bag
of
salt
on
his
knees
he
watched
the
cooks
and
the
scullions
but
he
did
not
see
them
put
anything
in
the
dishes
which
he
thought
could
take
the
place
of
salt
no
the
meat
was
without
salt
the
kasha
was
without
salt
and
there
was
no
salt
in
the
potatoes
ivan
nearly
turned
sick
at
the
thought
of
the
tastelessness
of
all
that
food
there
came
the
moment
when
all
the
cooks
and
scullions
ran
out
of
the
kitchen
to
fetch
the
silver
platters
on
which
to
lay
the
dishes
ivan
slipped
down
from
his
stool
and
running
from
stove
to
stove
from
saucepan
to
frying
pan
he
dropped
a
pinch
of
salt
just
what
was
wanted
no
more
no
less
in
everyone
of
the
dishes
then
he
ran
back
to
the
stool
in
the
corner
and
sat
there
and
watched
the
dishes
being
put
on
the
silver
platters
and
carried
off
in
napkins
to
be
the
dinner
of
the
tzar
the
tzar
sat
at
table
and
took
his
first
spoonful
of
soup
the
soup
is
very
good
says
he
and
he
finishes
the
soup
to
the
last
drop
i
never
known
the
soup
so
good
says
the
tzaritza
and
she
finishes
hers
this
is
the
best
soup
i
ever
tasted
says
the
princess
and
down
goes
hers
and
she
you
know
was
the
prettiest
princess
who
ever
had
dinner
in
this
world
it
was
the
same
with
the
kasha
and
the
same
with
the
meat
the
tzar
and
the
tzaritza
and
the
princess
wondered
why
they
had
never
had
so
good
a
dinner
in
all
their
lives
before
call
the
cooks
says
the
tzar
and
they
called
the
cooks
and
the
cooks
all
came
in
and
bowed
to
the
ground
and
stood
in
a
row
before
the
tzar
what
did
you
put
in
the
dishes
that
you
never
put
before
says
the
tzar
we
put
nothing
unusual
your
greatness
say
the
cooks
and
bowed
to
the
ground
again
then
why
do
the
dishes
taste
better
we
do
not
know
your
greatness
say
the
cooks
call
the
scullions
says
the
tzar
and
the
scullions
were
called
and
they
too
bowed
to
the
ground
and
stood
in
a
row
before
the
tzar
what
was
done
in
the
kitchen
that
has
not
been
done
there
before
says
the
tzar
nothing
your
greatness
say
all
the
scullions
except
one
and
that
one
scullion
bowed
again
and
kept
on
bowing
and
then
he
said
please
your
greatness
please
great
lord
there
is
usually
none
in
the
kitchen
but
ourselves
but
there
was
a
young
russian
merchant
who
sat
on
a
stool
in
the
corner
and
said
he
was
tired
call
the
merchant
says
the
tzar
so
they
brought
in
ivan
the
ninny
and
he
bowed
before
the
tzar
and
stood
there
with
his
little
bag
of
salt
in
his
hand
did
you
do
anything
to
my
dinner
says
the
tzar
i
did
your
greatness
says
ivan
what
did
you
do
i
put
a
pinch
of
russian
salt
in
every
dish
that
white
dust
says
the
tzar
nothing
but
that
have
you
got
any
more
of
it
i
have
a
little
ship
in
the
harbour
laden
with
nothing
else
says
ivan
it
is
the
most
wonderful
dust
in
the
world
says
the
tzar
and
i
will
buy
every
grain
of
it
you
have
what
do
you
want
for
it
ivan
the
ninny
scratched
his
head
and
thought
he
thought
that
if
the
tzar
liked
it
as
much
as
all
that
it
must
be
worth
a
fair
price
so
he
said
we
will
put
the
salt
into
bags
and
for
every
bag
of
salt
you
must
give
me
three
bags
of
the
same
weight
one
of
gold
one
of
silver
and
one
of
precious
stones
cheaper
than
that
your
greatness
i
could
not
possibly
sell
agreed
says
the
tzar
and
a
cheap
price
too
for
a
dust
so
full
of
magic
that
it
makes
dull
dishes
tasty
and
tasty
dishes
so
good
that
there
is
no
looking
away
from
them
so
all
the
day
long
and
far
into
the
night
the
ancient
old
sailormen
bent
their
backs
under
sacks
of
salt
and
bent
them
again
under
sacks
of
gold
and
silver
and
precious
stones
when
all
the
salt
had
been
put
in
the
tzar
treasury
yes
with
twenty
soldiers
guarding
it
with
great
swords
shining
in
the
moonlight
and
when
the
little
ship
was
loaded
with
riches
so
that
even
the
deck
was
piled
high
with
precious
stones
the
ancient
old
men
lay
down
among
the
jewels
and
slept
till
morning
when
ivan
the
ninny
went
to
bid
to
the
tzar
and
whither
shall
you
sail
now
asked
the
tzar
i
shall
sail
away
to
russia
in
my
little
ship
says
ivan
and
the
princess
who
was
very
beautiful
said
a
little
russian
ship
yes
says
ivan
i
have
never
seen
a
russian
ship
says
the
princess
and
she
begs
her
father
to
let
her
go
to
the
harbour
with
her
nurses
and
maids
to
see
the
little
russian
ship
before
ivan
set
sail
she
came
with
ivan
to
the
harbour
and
the
ancient
old
sailormen
took
them
on
board
she
ran
all
over
the
ship
looking
now
at
this
and
now
at
that
and
ivan
told
her
the
names
of
everything
deck
mast
and
rudder
may
i
see
the
sails
she
asked
and
the
ancient
old
men
hoisted
the
ragged
sails
and
the
wind
filled
the
sails
and
tugged
why
does
the
ship
move
when
the
sails
are
up
asked
the
princess
the
anchor
holds
her
said
ivan
please
let
me
see
the
anchor
says
the
princess
haul
up
the
anchor
my
children
and
show
it
to
the
princess
says
ivan
to
the
ancient
old
sailormen
and
the
old
men
hauled
up
the
anchor
and
showed
it
to
the
princess
and
she
said
it
was
a
very
good
little
anchor
but
of
course
as
soon
as
the
anchor
was
up
the
ship
began
to
move
one
of
the
ancient
old
men
bent
over
the
tiller
and
with
a
fair
wind
behind
her
the
little
ship
slipped
out
of
the
harbour
and
away
to
the
blue
sea
when
the
princess
looked
round
thinking
it
was
time
to
go
home
the
little
ship
was
far
from
land
and
away
in
the
distance
she
could
only
see
the
gold
towers
of
her
father
palace
glittering
like
pin
points
in
the
sunlight
her
nurses
and
maids
wrung
their
hands
and
made
an
outcry
and
the
princess
sat
down
on
a
heap
of
jewels
and
put
a
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
cried
and
cried
and
cried
ivan
the
ninny
took
her
hands
and
comforted
her
and
told
her
of
the
wonders
of
the
sea
that
he
would
show
her
and
the
wonders
of
the
land
and
she
looked
up
at
him
while
he
talked
and
his
eyes
were
kind
and
hers
were
sweet
and
the
end
of
it
was
that
they
were
both
very
well
content
and
agreed
to
have
a
marriage
feast
as
soon
as
the
little
ship
should
bring
them
to
the
home
of
ivan
father
merry
was
that
voyage
all
day
long
ivan
and
the
princess
sat
on
deck
and
said
sweet
things
to
each
other
and
at
twilight
they
sang
songs
and
drank
tea
and
told
stories
as
for
the
nurses
and
maids
the
princess
told
them
to
be
glad
and
so
they
danced
and
clapped
their
hands
and
ran
about
the
ship
and
teased
the
ancient
old
sailormen
when
they
had
been
sailing
many
days
the
princess
was
looking
out
over
the
sea
and
she
cried
out
to
ivan
see
over
there
far
away
are
two
big
ships
with
white
sails
not
like
our
sails
of
brocade
and
bits
of
silk
ivan
looked
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hands
why
those
are
the
ships
of
my
elder
brothers
said
he
we
shall
all
sail
home
together
and
he
made
the
ancient
old
sailormen
give
a
hail
in
their
cracked
old
voices
and
the
brothers
heard
them
and
came
on
board
to
greet
ivan
and
his
bride
and
when
they
saw
that
she
was
a
tzar
daughter
and
that
the
very
decks
were
heaped
with
precious
stones
because
there
was
no
room
below
they
said
one
thing
to
ivan
and
something
else
to
each
other
to
ivan
they
said
thanks
be
to
god
he
has
given
you
good
trading
but
to
each
other
how
can
this
be
says
one
ivan
the
ninny
bringing
back
such
a
cargo
while
we
in
our
fine
ships
have
only
a
bag
or
two
of
gold
and
what
is
ivan
the
ninny
doing
with
a
princess
says
the
other
and
they
ground
their
teeth
and
waited
their
time
and
came
up
suddenly
when
ivan
was
alone
in
the
twilight
and
picked
him
up
by
his
head
and
his
heels
and
hove
him
overboard
into
the
dark
blue
sea
not
one
of
the
old
men
had
seen
them
and
the
princess
was
not
on
deck
in
the
morning
they
said
that
ivan
the
ninny
must
have
walked
overboard
in
his
sleep
and
they
drew
lots
the
eldest
brother
took
the
princess
and
the
second
brother
took
the
little
ship
laden
with
gold
and
silver
and
precious
stones
and
so
the
brothers
sailed
home
very
well
content
but
the
princess
sat
and
wept
all
day
long
looking
down
into
the
blue
water
the
elder
brother
could
not
comfort
her
and
the
second
brother
did
not
try
and
the
ancient
old
sailormen
muttered
in
their
beards
and
were
sorry
and
prayed
to
god
to
give
rest
to
ivan
soul
for
although
he
had
been
a
ninny
and
although
he
had
made
them
carry
a
lot
of
salt
and
other
things
yet
they
loved
him
because
he
knew
how
to
talk
to
ancient
old
sailormen
but
ivan
was
not
dead
as
soon
as
he
splashed
into
the
water
he
crammed
his
fur
hat
a
little
tighter
on
his
head
and
began
swimming
in
the
sea
he
swam
about
until
the
sun
rose
and
then
not
far
away
he
saw
a
floating
timber
log
and
he
swam
to
the
log
and
got
astride
of
it
and
thanked
god
and
he
sat
there
on
the
log
in
the
middle
of
the
sea
twiddling
his
thumbs
for
want
of
something
to
do
there
was
a
strong
current
in
the
sea
that
carried
him
along
and
at
last
after
floating
for
many
days
without
ever
a
bite
for
his
teeth
or
a
drop
for
his
gullet
his
feet
touched
land
now
that
was
at
night
and
he
left
the
log
and
walked
up
out
of
the
sea
and
lay
down
on
the
shore
and
waited
for
morning
when
the
sun
rose
he
stood
up
and
saw
that
he
was
on
a
bare
island
and
he
saw
nothing
at
all
on
the
island
except
a
huge
house
as
big
as
a
mountain
and
as
he
was
looking
at
the
house
the
great
door
creaked
with
a
noise
like
that
of
a
hurricane
among
the
pine
forests
and
opened
and
a
giant
came
walking
out
and
came
to
the
shore
and
stood
there
looking
down
at
ivan
what
are
you
doing
here
little
one
says
the
giant
ivan
told
him
the
whole
story
just
as
i
have
told
it
to
you
the
giant
listened
to
the
very
end
pulling
at
his
monstrous
whiskers
then
he
said
listen
little
one
i
know
more
of
the
story
than
you
for
i
can
tell
you
that
morning
your
eldest
brother
is
going
to
marry
your
princess
but
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
take
on
about
it
if
you
want
to
be
there
i
will
carry
you
and
set
you
down
before
the
house
in
time
for
the
wedding
and
a
fine
wedding
it
is
like
to
be
for
your
father
thinks
well
of
those
brothers
of
yours
bringing
back
all
those
precious
stones
and
silver
and
gold
enough
to
buy
a
kingdom
and
with
that
he
picked
up
ivan
the
ninny
and
set
him
on
his
great
shoulders
and
set
off
striding
through
the
sea
he
went
so
fast
that
the
wind
of
his
going
blew
off
ivan
hat
stop
a
moment
shouts
ivan
my
hat
has
blown
off
we
ca
turn
back
for
that
says
the
giant
we
have
already
left
your
hat
five
hundred
versts
behind
us
and
he
rushed
on
splashing
through
the
sea
the
sea
was
up
to
his
armpits
he
rushed
on
and
the
sea
was
up
to
his
waist
he
rushed
on
and
before
the
sun
had
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
blue
sky
he
was
splashing
up
out
of
the
sea
with
the
water
about
his
ankles
he
lifted
ivan
from
his
shoulders
and
set
him
on
the
ground
now
says
he
little
man
off
you
run
and
you
be
in
time
for
the
feast
but
do
you
dare
to
boast
about
riding
on
my
shoulders
if
you
open
your
mouth
about
that
you
smart
for
it
if
i
have
to
come
ten
thousand
thousand
versts
ivan
the
ninny
thanked
the
giant
for
carrying
him
through
the
sea
promised
that
he
would
not
boast
and
then
ran
off
to
his
house
long
before
he
got
there
he
heard
the
musicians
in
the
courtyard
playing
as
if
they
wanted
to
wear
out
their
instruments
before
night
the
wedding
feast
had
begun
and
when
ivan
ran
in
there
at
the
high
board
was
sitting
the
princess
and
beside
her
his
eldest
brother
and
there
were
his
father
and
mother
his
second
brother
and
all
the
guests
and
everyone
of
them
was
as
merry
as
could
be
except
the
princess
and
she
was
as
white
as
the
salt
he
had
sold
to
her
father
suddenly
the
blood
flushed
into
her
cheeks
she
saw
ivan
in
the
doorway
up
she
jumped
at
the
high
board
and
cried
out
there
there
is
my
true
love
and
not
this
man
who
sits
beside
me
at
the
table
what
is
this
says
ivan
father
and
in
a
few
minutes
knew
the
whole
story
he
turned
the
two
elder
brothers
out
of
doors
gave
their
ships
to
ivan
married
him
to
the
princess
and
made
him
his
heir
and
the
wedding
feast
began
again
and
they
sent
for
the
ancient
old
sailormen
to
take
part
in
it
and
the
ancient
old
sailormen
wept
with
joy
when
they
saw
ivan
and
the
princess
like
two
sweet
pigeons
sitting
side
by
side
yes
and
they
lifted
their
flagons
with
their
old
shaking
hands
and
cheered
with
their
old
cracked
voices
and
poured
the
wine
down
their
dry
old
throats
there
was
wine
enough
and
to
spare
beer
too
and
mead
enough
to
drown
a
herd
of
cattle
and
as
the
guests
drank
and
grew
merry
and
proud
they
set
to
boasting
this
one
bragged
of
his
riches
that
one
of
his
wife
another
boasted
of
his
cunning
another
of
his
new
house
another
of
his
strength
and
this
one
was
angry
because
they
would
not
let
him
show
how
he
could
lift
the
table
on
one
hand
they
all
drank
ivan
health
and
he
drank
theirs
and
in
the
end
he
could
not
bear
to
listen
to
their
proud
boasts
that
all
very
well
says
he
but
i
am
the
only
man
in
the
world
who
rode
on
the
shoulders
of
a
giant
to
come
to
his
wedding
feast
the
words
were
scarcely
out
of
his
mouth
before
there
were
a
tremendous
trampling
and
a
roar
of
a
great
wind
the
house
shook
with
the
footsteps
of
the
giant
as
he
strode
up
the
giant
bent
down
over
the
courtyard
and
looked
in
at
the
feast
little
man
little
man
says
he
you
promised
not
to
boast
of
me
i
told
you
what
would
come
if
you
did
and
here
you
are
and
have
boasted
already
forgive
me
says
ivan
it
was
the
drink
that
boasted
not
i
what
sort
of
drink
is
it
that
knows
how
to
boast
says
the
giant
you
shall
taste
it
says
ivan
and
he
made
his
ancient
old
sailormen
roll
a
great
barrel
of
wine
into
the
yard
more
than
enough
for
a
hundred
men
and
after
that
a
barrel
of
beer
that
was
as
big
and
then
a
barrel
of
mead
that
was
no
smaller
try
the
taste
of
that
says
ivan
the
ninny
well
the
giant
did
not
wait
to
be
asked
twice
he
lifted
the
barrel
of
wine
as
if
it
had
been
a
little
glass
and
emptied
it
down
his
throat
he
lifted
the
barrel
of
beer
as
if
it
had
been
an
acorn
and
emptied
it
after
the
wine
then
he
lifted
the
barrel
of
mead
as
if
it
had
been
a
very
small
pea
and
swallowed
every
drop
of
mead
that
was
in
it
and
after
that
he
began
stamping
about
and
breaking
things
houses
fell
to
pieces
this
way
and
that
and
trees
were
swept
flat
like
grass
every
step
the
giant
took
was
followed
by
the
crash
of
breaking
timbers
then
suddenly
he
fell
flat
on
his
back
and
slept
for
three
days
and
nights
he
slept
without
waking
at
last
he
opened
his
eyes
just
look
about
you
says
ivan
and
see
the
damage
that
done
and
did
that
little
drop
of
drink
make
me
do
all
that
says
the
giant
well
well
i
can
well
understand
that
a
drink
like
that
can
do
a
bit
of
bragging
and
after
that
says
he
looking
at
the
wrecks
of
houses
and
all
the
broken
things
scattered
about
after
that
says
he
you
can
boast
of
me
for
a
thousand
years
and
i
have
nothing
against
you
and
he
tugged
at
his
great
whiskers
and
wrinkled
his
eyes
and
went
striding
off
into
the
sea
that
is
the
story
about
salt
and
how
it
made
a
rich
man
of
ivan
the
ninny
and
besides
gave
him
the
prettiest
wife
in
the
world
and
she
a
tzar
daughter
the
christening
in
the
village
this
chapter
is
not
one
of
old
peter
stories
though
there
are
doubtless
some
stories
in
it
it
tells
how
vanya
and
maroosia
drove
to
the
village
to
see
a
new
baby
old
peter
had
a
sister
who
lived
in
the
village
not
so
very
far
away
from
the
forest
and
she
had
a
plump
daughter
and
the
daughter
was
called
nastasia
and
she
was
married
to
a
handsome
peasant
called
sergie
who
had
three
cows
a
lot
of
pigs
and
a
flock
of
fat
geese
and
one
day
when
old
peter
had
gone
to
the
village
to
buy
tobacco
and
sugar
and
sunflower
seeds
he
came
back
in
the
evening
and
said
to
the
children
there
something
new
in
the
village
what
sort
of
a
something
asked
vanya
alive
said
old
peter
is
there
a
lot
of
it
asked
vanya
no
only
one
then
it
ca
be
pigs
said
vanya
in
a
melancholy
voice
i
thought
it
was
pigs
perhaps
it
is
a
little
calf
said
maroosia
i
know
what
it
is
said
vanya
well
it
a
foal
it
brown
all
over
with
white
on
its
nose
and
a
lot
of
white
hairs
in
its
tail
no
what
is
it
then
grandfather
i
tell
you
little
pigeons
it
small
and
red
and
it
got
a
bumpy
head
with
hair
on
it
like
the
fluff
of
a
duckling
it
has
blue
eyes
and
ten
fingers
to
its
fore
paws
and
ten
toes
to
its
hind
feet
five
to
each
it
a
baby
said
maroosia
yes
nastasia
has
got
a
little
son
aunt
sofia
has
got
a
grandson
you
have
got
a
new
cousin
and
i
have
got
a
new
think
of
that
already
it
a
son
and
a
cousin
and
a
grandson
and
a
and
he
only
been
alive
twelve
hours
he
lost
no
time
in
taking
a
position
for
himself
he
be
a
great
man
one
of
these
days
if
he
goes
on
as
fast
as
that
the
children
had
jumped
up
as
soon
as
they
knew
it
was
a
baby
when
is
the
christening
the
day
after
o
grandfather
well
who
is
going
to
the
christening
the
baby
of
course
yes
but
other
people
all
the
village
and
us
i
have
to
go
and
i
suppose
there
be
room
in
the
cart
for
two
little
bear
cubs
like
you
and
so
it
was
settled
that
vanya
and
maroosia
were
to
go
to
the
christening
of
their
new
cousin
who
was
only
twelve
hours
old
all
the
next
day
they
could
think
of
nothing
else
and
early
on
the
morning
of
the
christening
they
were
up
and
about
maroosia
seeing
that
vanya
had
on
a
clean
shirt
and
herself
putting
a
green
ribbon
in
her
hair
the
sun
shone
and
the
leaves
on
the
trees
were
all
new
and
bright
and
the
sky
was
pale
blue
through
the
flickering
green
leaves
old
peter
was
up
early
too
harnessing
the
little
yellow
horse
into
the
old
cart
the
cart
was
of
rough
wood
without
springs
like
a
big
box
fixed
on
long
larch
poles
between
two
pairs
of
wheels
the
larch
poles
did
instead
of
springs
bending
and
creaking
as
the
cart
moved
over
the
forest
track
the
shafts
came
from
the
front
wheels
upwards
to
the
horse
shoulders
and
between
the
ends
of
them
there
was
a
tall
strong
hoop
of
wood
called
a
douga
which
rose
high
over
the
shoulders
of
the
horse
above
his
collar
and
had
two
little
bells
hanging
from
it
at
the
top
the
wooden
hoop
was
painted
green
with
little
red
flowers
the
harness
was
mostly
of
ropes
but
that
did
not
matter
so
long
as
it
held
together
the
horse
had
a
long
tail
and
mane
and
looked
as
untidy
as
a
little
boy
but
he
had
a
green
ribbon
in
his
forelock
in
honour
of
the
christening
and
he
could
go
like
anything
and
never
got
tired
when
all
was
ready
old
peter
arranged
a
lot
of
soft
fresh
hay
in
the
cart
for
the
children
to
sit
in
hay
is
the
best
thing
in
the
world
to
sit
in
when
you
drive
in
a
jolting
russian
cart
old
peter
put
in
a
tremendous
lot
so
that
the
horse
could
eat
some
of
it
while
waiting
in
the
village
and
yet
leave
them
enough
to
make
them
comfortable
on
the
journey
back
finally
old
peter
took
a
gun
that
he
had
spent
all
the
evening
before
in
cleaning
and
laid
it
carefully
in
the
hay
what
is
the
gun
for
asked
vanya
i
am
to
be
a
godparent
said
old
peter
and
i
want
to
give
him
a
present
i
could
not
give
him
a
better
present
than
a
gun
for
he
shall
be
a
forester
and
a
good
shot
and
you
can
not
begin
too
early
presently
vanya
and
maroosia
were
tucked
into
the
hay
and
old
peter
climbed
in
with
the
plaited
reins
and
away
they
went
along
the
narrow
forest
track
where
the
wheels
followed
the
ruts
and
splashed
through
the
deep
holes
for
the
spring
was
young
and
the
roads
had
not
yet
dried
some
of
the
deepest
holes
had
a
few
pine
branches
laid
in
them
but
that
was
the
only
that
ever
was
done
overhead
were
the
tall
firs
and
silver
birches
with
their
little
pale
round
leaves
and
somewhere
not
far
away
a
cuckoo
was
calling
while
the
murmur
of
the
wild
pigeons
never
stopped
for
a
moment
they
drove
on
and
on
through
the
forest
and
at
last
came
out
from
among
the
trees
into
the
open
country
a
broad
flat
plain
stretching
to
the
river
far
away
they
could
see
the
big
square
sail
of
a
boat
swelled
out
in
the
light
wind
and
they
knew
that
there
was
the
river
on
the
banks
of
which
stood
the
village
they
could
see
a
small
clump
of
trees
and
as
they
came
nearer
the
pale
green
cupolas
of
the
white
village
church
rising
above
the
tops
of
the
birches
presently
they
came
to
a
rough
wooden
bridge
and
crossed
over
a
little
stream
that
was
on
its
way
to
join
the
big
river
vanya
looked
at
it
grandfather
he
asked
when
the
frost
went
which
was
water
first
the
big
river
or
the
little
river
why
the
little
river
of
course
said
old
peter
it
always
the
little
streams
that
wake
first
in
the
spring
and
running
down
to
the
big
river
make
it
swell
and
flood
and
break
up
the
ice
it
always
been
so
ever
since
the
quarrel
between
the
vazouza
and
the
volga
what
was
that
said
vanya
it
was
like
this
said
old
peter
the
vazouza
and
the
volga
flow
for
a
long
way
side
by
side
and
then
they
join
and
flow
together
and
the
vazouza
is
a
little
river
but
the
volga
is
the
mother
of
all
russia
and
the
greatest
river
in
the
world
and
the
little
vazouza
was
jealous
of
the
volga
you
are
big
and
noisy
she
says
to
the
volga
and
terribly
strong
but
as
for
brains
says
she
why
i
have
more
brains
in
a
single
ripple
than
you
in
all
that
lump
of
water
of
course
the
volga
told
her
not
to
be
so
rude
and
said
that
little
rivers
should
know
their
place
and
not
argue
with
the
great
but
the
vazouza
would
not
keep
quiet
and
at
last
she
said
to
the
volga
look
here
we
will
lie
down
and
sleep
and
we
will
agree
that
the
one
of
us
who
wakes
first
and
comes
first
to
the
sea
is
the
wiser
of
the
two
and
the
volga
said
very
well
if
only
you
will
stop
talking
so
the
little
vazouza
and
the
big
volga
lay
and
slept
white
and
still
all
through
the
winter
and
when
the
spring
came
the
little
vazouza
woke
first
brisk
and
laughing
and
hurrying
and
rushed
away
as
hard
as
she
could
go
towards
the
sea
when
the
volga
woke
the
little
vazouza
was
already
far
ahead
but
the
volga
did
not
hurry
she
woke
slowly
and
shook
the
ice
from
herself
and
then
came
roaring
after
the
vazouza
a
huge
foaming
flood
of
angry
water
and
the
little
vazouza
listened
as
she
ran
and
she
heard
the
volga
coming
after
her
and
when
the
volga
caught
her
up
a
tremendous
foaming
river
whirling
along
trees
and
blocks
of
ice
she
was
frightened
and
she
said
o
volga
let
me
be
your
little
sister
i
will
never
argue
with
you
any
more
you
are
wiser
than
i
and
stronger
than
i
only
take
me
by
the
hand
and
bring
me
with
you
to
the
sea
and
the
volga
forgave
the
little
vazouza
and
took
her
by
the
hand
and
brought
her
safely
to
the
sea
and
they
have
never
quarrelled
again
but
all
the
same
it
is
always
the
little
vazouza
that
gets
up
first
in
the
spring
and
tugs
at
the
white
blankets
of
ice
and
snow
and
wakes
her
big
sister
from
her
winter
sleep
they
drove
on
over
the
flat
open
country
with
no
hedges
but
only
ditches
to
drain
off
the
floods
and
very
often
not
even
ditches
to
divide
one
field
from
another
and
huge
crows
with
gray
hoods
and
shawls
pecked
about
in
the
grass
at
the
roadside
or
flew
heavily
in
the
sunshine
they
passed
a
little
girl
with
a
flock
of
geese
and
another
little
girl
lying
in
the
grass
holding
a
long
rope
which
was
fastened
to
the
horns
of
a
brown
cow
and
the
little
girl
lay
on
her
face
and
slept
among
the
flowers
while
the
cow
walked
slowly
round
her
step
by
step
chewing
the
grass
and
thinking
about
nothing
at
all
and
at
last
they
came
to
the
village
where
the
road
was
wider
and
instead
of
one
pair
of
ruts
there
were
dozens
and
the
cart
bumped
worse
than
ever
the
broad
earthy
road
had
no
stones
in
it
and
in
places
where
the
puddles
would
have
been
deeper
than
the
axles
of
the
wheels
it
had
been
mended
by
laying
down
fir
logs
and
small
branches
in
the
puddles
and
putting
a
few
spadefuls
of
earth
on
the
top
of
them
the
road
ran
right
through
the
village
on
either
side
of
it
were
little
wooden
huts
the
ends
of
the
timbers
crossed
outside
at
the
four
corners
of
the
huts
they
fitted
neatly
into
each
other
and
some
of
them
were
carved
and
there
were
no
slates
or
tiles
on
the
roofs
but
little
thin
slips
of
wood
overlapping
each
other
there
was
not
a
single
stone
hut
or
cottage
in
the
village
only
the
church
was
partly
brick
whitewashed
with
bright
green
cupolas
up
in
the
air
and
thin
gold
crosses
on
the
tops
of
the
cupolas
shining
in
the
clear
sky
outside
the
church
were
rows
of
short
posts
with
long
rough
fir
timbers
nailed
on
the
top
of
them
to
which
the
country
people
tied
their
horses
when
they
came
to
church
there
were
several
carts
there
already
with
rugs
lying
on
the
hay
in
them
and
the
horses
were
eating
hay
or
biting
the
logs
always
except
when
the
logs
are
quite
new
you
can
tell
the
favourite
places
for
tying
up
horses
to
them
because
the
timbers
will
have
deep
holes
in
them
where
they
have
been
gnawed
away
by
the
horses
teeth
they
bite
the
timbers
while
their
masters
eat
sunflower
seeds
not
for
food
but
to
pass
the
time
now
then
said
old
peter
as
he
got
down
from
the
cart
tied
the
horse
gave
him
an
armful
of
hay
from
the
cart
and
lifted
the
children
out
be
quick
we
shall
be
late
if
we
do
take
care
i
believe
we
are
late
good
health
to
you
fedor
he
said
to
an
old
peasant
and
has
the
baby
gone
in
he
has
peter
and
my
health
is
not
so
bad
and
how
is
yours
good
also
fedor
thanks
be
to
god
and
will
you
see
to
these
two
for
i
am
a
godparent
and
must
be
near
the
priest
willingly
said
the
old
peasant
fedor
how
they
do
grow
to
be
sure
like
young
birch
trees
come
along
then
little
pigeons
old
peter
hurried
into
the
church
followed
by
fedor
with
vanya
and
maroosia
they
all
crossed
themselves
and
said
a
prayer
as
they
went
in
the
ceremony
was
just
beginning
the
priest
in
his
silk
robes
was
standing
before
the
gold
and
painted
screen
at
the
end
of
the
church
and
there
were
the
basin
of
holy
water
and
old
peter
sister
and
the
nurse
babka
tanya
very
proud
holding
the
baby
in
a
roll
of
white
linen
and
rocking
it
to
and
fro
there
were
coloured
pictures
of
saints
all
over
the
screen
which
stretches
from
one
side
of
the
church
to
the
other
some
of
the
pictures
were
framed
in
gilt
frames
under
glass
and
were
partly
painted
and
partly
metal
the
faces
and
hands
of
the
saints
were
painted
and
their
clothes
were
glittering
silver
or
gold
little
lamps
were
burning
in
front
of
them
and
candles
a
russian
christening
is
very
different
from
an
english
one
for
one
thing
the
baby
goes
right
into
the
water
not
once
but
three
times
babka
tanya
unrolled
the
baby
and
the
priest
covered
its
face
with
his
hand
and
down
it
went
under
the
water
once
twice
and
again
then
he
took
some
of
the
sacred
ointment
on
his
finger
and
anointed
the
baby
forehead
and
feet
and
hands
and
little
round
stomach
then
with
a
pair
of
scissors
he
cut
a
little
pinch
of
fluff
from
the
baby
head
and
rolled
it
into
a
pellet
with
the
ointment
and
threw
the
pellet
into
the
holy
water
and
after
that
the
baby
was
carried
solemnly
three
times
round
the
holy
water
the
priest
blessed
it
and
prayed
for
it
and
there
it
was
a
little
true
russian
ready
to
be
carried
back
to
its
mother
nastasia
who
lay
at
home
in
her
cottage
waiting
for
it
when
they
got
outside
the
church
they
all
went
to
nastasia
cottage
to
congratulate
her
on
her
baby
and
to
tell
her
what
good
lungs
it
had
and
what
a
handsome
face
and
how
it
was
exactly
like
its
father
nastasia
smiled
at
vanya
and
maroosia
but
they
had
no
eyes
except
for
the
baby
and
for
all
that
belonged
to
it
especially
its
cradle
now
a
russian
baby
has
a
very
much
finer
cradle
than
an
english
baby
a
long
fir
pole
is
fastened
in
the
middle
and
at
one
end
to
the
beams
in
the
ceiling
of
the
hut
so
that
the
other
end
swings
free
just
below
the
rafters
from
this
end
is
hung
a
big
basket
and
on
the
ropes
by
which
the
basket
hangs
are
fastened
shawls
of
bright
colours
the
baby
is
tucked
in
the
basket
the
shawls
closed
round
it
and
as
the
mother
or
the
nurse
sits
at
her
spinning
she
just
kicks
the
basket
gently
now
and
again
and
it
swings
up
and
down
from
the
end
of
the
pole
as
if
it
were
hung
from
the
branch
of
a
tree
this
baby
had
a
fine
new
basket
and
a
larch
pole
newly
fixed
white
and
shining
under
the
dark
beams
of
the
ceiling
it
had
presents
besides
old
peter
gun
it
had
a
fine
wooden
spoon
with
a
picture
on
it
of
a
cottage
and
a
fish
it
had
a
wooden
bowl
and
a
painted
mug
bought
from
one
of
the
peddling
barges
that
go
up
and
down
the
rivers
selling
chairs
and
crockery
just
like
the
caravans
that
travel
our
english
roads
and
also
although
it
was
so
young
it
had
a
little
sacred
picture
made
of
metal
a
picture
of
nikolai
because
this
was
nikolai
day
and
the
baby
was
called
nikolai
there
was
a
samovar
already
steaming
in
the
cottage
and
a
great
cake
of
pastry
and
cabbage
and
egg
and
fish
and
there
were
cabbage
soup
with
sour
cream
and
black
bread
and
a
little
white
bread
and
red
kisel
jelly
and
a
huge
jug
of
milk
and
everybody
ate
and
drank
and
talked
as
if
they
were
never
going
to
stop
the
sun
was
warm
and
presently
the
men
went
outside
and
sat
on
a
log
leaning
their
backs
against
the
wall
of
the
hut
and
making
cigarettes
and
smoking
or
eating
sunflower
seeds
cracking
the
husks
with
their
teeth
taking
out
the
white
kernels
and
blowing
the
husks
away
and
the
women
sat
in
the
hut
and
now
and
then
brought
out
glasses
of
hot
tea
to
the
men
and
then
went
back
again
to
talk
of
what
a
fine
man
the
baby
would
be
and
to
remember
other
babies
and
the
old
women
looked
at
the
young
mothers
and
laughed
and
said
that
they
could
remember
the
days
when
they
were
christened
when
they
were
babies
themselves
no
bigger
than
the
little
nikolai
who
swung
in
the
basket
and
squalled
or
slept
proudly
just
as
if
he
knew
that
all
the
world
belonged
to
him
because
he
was
so
very
young
and
vanya
and
maroosia
ate
sunflower
seeds
too
and
sometimes
played
outside
the
cottage
and
sometimes
inside
but
mostly
stood
very
quiet
close
to
the
swinging
cradle
waiting
till
old
babka
tanya
the
nurse
should
pull
the
shawls
a
little
way
aside
and
let
them
see
the
pink
crumpled
face
of
the
little
nikolai
and
the
yellow
fluff
just
like
a
duckling
which
covered
his
bumpy
pink
head
at
last
towards
evening
old
peter
packed
what
was
left
of
the
hay
into
the
cart
and
packed
vanya
and
maroosia
in
with
the
hay
everybody
said
all
round
and
peter
climbed
in
and
took
up
the
rope
reins
he
be
a
fine
man
he
shouted
through
the
door
to
nastasia
a
fine
man
and
god
grant
he
be
as
healthy
as
he
is
till
we
meet
again
he
cried
out
merrily
to
the
villagers
and
vanya
and
maroosia
waved
their
hands
and
off
they
drove
back
again
to
the
hut
in
the
forest
they
were
very
much
quieter
on
the
way
back
than
they
had
been
when
they
drove
to
the
village
in
the
morning
and
the
early
summer
day
was
quiet
as
it
came
to
its
end
there
was
a
corncrake
rattling
in
the
fields
and
more
than
once
they
saw
frogs
hop
out
of
the
road
as
they
drove
by
in
the
twilight
a
hare
ran
before
them
through
the
dusk
and
disappeared
and
when
they
came
to
the
wooden
bridge
over
the
stream
a
tall
gray
bird
with
a
long
beak
rose
up
from
the
bank
and
flew
slowly
away
carrying
his
long
legs
like
a
thin
pair
of
crutches
straight
out
behind
him
who
is
that
asked
vanya
sleepily
from
his
nest
in
the
hay
that
is
crane
said
old
peter
perhaps
he
is
on
his
way
to
visit
miss
heron
and
tell
her
that
this
time
he
has
really
made
up
his
mind
and
to
ask
her
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
what
bygones
said
vanya
old
peter
watched
the
crane
slow
steady
flight
above
the
low
marshy
ground
on
either
side
of
the
stream
and
then
he
said
why
surely
you
know
all
about
that
it
is
an
old
story
little
one
and
i
must
have
told
it
you
a
dozen
times
no
never
grandfather
said
maroosia
she
was
nearly
as
sleepy
as
vanya
after
the
day
in
the
village
and
the
fuss
and
pleasure
of
the
christening
oh
well
said
old
peter
and
he
told
the
tale
of
crane
and
miss
heron
as
the
cart
bumped
slowly
along
the
rough
road
while
vanya
and
maroosia
looked
out
with
sleepy
eyes
from
their
nest
of
hay
and
listened
and
the
sky
turned
green
and
the
trees
grew
dim
and
the
frogs
croaked
in
the
ditches
crane
and
miss
heron
lived
in
a
marsh
five
miles
across
from
end
to
end
they
lived
there
and
fed
on
the
frogs
which
they
caught
in
their
long
bills
and
held
up
in
the
air
for
a
moment
and
then
swallowed
standing
on
one
leg
the
marsh
was
always
damp
and
there
were
always
plenty
of
frogs
and
life
went
well
for
them
except
that
they
saw
very
little
company
they
had
no
one
to
pass
the
time
of
day
with
for
crane
had
built
his
little
hut
on
one
side
of
the
marsh
and
miss
heron
had
built
hers
on
the
other
so
it
came
into
the
head
of
crane
that
it
was
dull
work
living
alone
if
only
i
were
married
he
thought
there
would
be
two
of
us
to
drink
our
tea
beside
the
samovar
at
night
and
i
should
not
spend
my
evenings
in
melancholy
thinking
only
of
frogs
i
will
go
to
see
miss
heron
and
i
will
offer
to
marry
her
so
off
he
flew
to
the
other
side
of
the
marsh
flap
flap
with
his
legs
hanging
out
behind
just
as
we
saw
him
he
came
to
the
other
side
of
the
marsh
and
flew
down
to
the
hut
of
miss
heron
he
tapped
on
the
door
with
his
long
beak
is
miss
heron
at
home
at
home
said
miss
heron
will
you
marry
me
said
crane
of
course
i
wo
said
miss
heron
your
legs
are
long
and
and
your
coat
is
short
and
you
fly
awkwardly
and
you

not
even
rich
you
would
have
no
dainties
to
feed
me
with

and

bothering
me
she
shut
the
door
in
his
face
crane
looked
the
fool
he
thought
himself
and
went
off
home
wishing
he
had
never
made
the
journey
but
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
miss
heron
sitting
alone
in
her
hut
began
to
think
things
over
and
to
be
sorry
she
had
spoken
in
such
a
hurry
after
all
thinks
she
it
is
poor
work
living
alone
and
crane
in
spite
of
what
i
said
about
his
looks
is
really
a
handsome
enough
young
fellow
indeed
at
evening
when
he
stands
on
one
leg
he
is
very
handsome
indeed
yes
i
will
go
and
marry
him
so
off
flew
miss
heron
flap
flap
over
five
miles
of
marsh
and
came
to
the
hut
of
crane
is
the
master
at
home
at
home
said
crane
ah

said
miss
heron
i
was
chaffing
you
just
now
when
shall
we
be
married
no
miss
heron
said
crane
i
have
no
need
of
you
at
all
i
do
not
wish
to
marry
and
i
would
not
take
you
for
my
wife
even
if
i
did
clear
out
and
let
me
see
the
last
of
you
he
shut
the
door
miss
heron
wept
tears
of
shame
that
ran
from
her
eyes
down
her
long
bill
and
dropped
one
by
one
to
the
ground
then
she
flew
away
home
wishing
she
had
not
come
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
crane
began
to
think
and
he
said
to
himself
what
a
fool
i
was
to
be
so
short
with
miss
heron
it
dull
living
alone
since
she
wants
it
i
will
marry
her
and
he
flew
off
after
miss
heron
he
came
to
her
hut
and
told
her
miss
heron
i
have
thought
things
over
i
have
decided
to
marry
you
crane
said
miss
heron
i
too
have
thought
things
over
i
would
not
marry
you
not
for
ten
thousand
young
frogs
off
flew
crane
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
miss
heron
thought
why
did
i
agree
to
marry
crane
it
dull
alone
i
will
go
at
once
and
tell
him
i
have
changed
my
mind
she
flew
off
to
betroth
herself
but
crane
would
have
none
of
her
and
she
flew
back
again
and
so
they
go
on
to
this
day
first
one
and
then
the
other
flying
across
the
marsh
with
an
offer
of
marriage
and
flying
back
with
shame
they
have
never
married
and
never
will
grandfather
whispered
maroosia
tugging
at
old
peter
sleeve
vanya
is
asleep
they
drove
on
through
the
forest
silently
except
for
the
creaking
of
the
cart
and
the
loud
singing
of
the
nightingales
in
the
tops
of
the
tall
firs
they
came
at
last
to
their
hut
ah
said
old
peter
as
he
lifted
them
out
first
one
and
then
the
other
it
is
only
vanya
who
asleep
and
he
carried
them
in
and
put
them
to

without
