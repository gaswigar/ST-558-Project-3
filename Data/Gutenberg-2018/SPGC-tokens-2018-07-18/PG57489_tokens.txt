military

ruled
the

quivered
in
the
relentless
grasp
of

the

or
the
place
de

concorde
presented
such
a
spectacle
it
was
no
longer
the
case
of
a
band
of
fanatics
rallied
about
a
flag
marching
to
some
conquest
of
the
sword
and
followed
by
a
throng
of
the
curious
and
the
idle
eager
to
see
what
would
happen

of
the
entire
population
anxious
agitated
terrified
composed
of
every
class
of
society
without
distinction
hanging
upon
the
decision
of
an
oracle
waiting
feverishly
the
result
of
the
calculations
which
a
celebrated
astronomer
was
to
announce
that
very
monday
at
three
o
clock
in
the
session
of
the
academy
of
sciences
amid
the
flux
of
politics
and
society
the
institute
survived
maintaining
still
in
europe
its
supremacy
in
science
literature
and
art
the

of
civilization
however
had
moved
westward
and
the
focus
of
progress
shone
on
the
shores
of

in
north

this
new
palace
of
the
institute
with
its
lofty
domes

had
been

upon
the
ruins
remaining
after
the
great
social
revolution
of
the
international

who
in

in

seemed
arrested

anxiety
was
depicted
upon
every

strangers
addressed
each
other
without
hesitation
and
but
one
question
fell
from
pale
and
trembling
lips
is
it
then
true
the
most
deadly
pestilence
would
have
carried
far
less
terror
to
the
heart
than
the
astronomical
prediction
on
every
tongue
it
would
have
made
fewer
victims
for
already
from
some
unknown
cause
the
was
increasing
at
every
instant
one
felt
the
electric
shock
of
a
terrible
fear
a
few
less
dismayed
wished
to
appear
more
confident
and
sounded
now
and
then
a
note
of
doubt
even
of
hope
as
it
may
prove
a
mistake
or
it
will
pass
on
one
side
or
again
it
will
amount
to
nothing
we
shall
get
off
with
a
fright
and
other
like
assurances
but
expectation
and
uncertainty
are
often
more
terrible
than
the
catastrophe
itself
a
brutal
blow
knocks
us
down
once
for
all
prostrating
us
more
or
less
completely
we
come
to
our
senses
we
make
the
best
of
it
we
recover
and
take
up
life
again
but
this
was
the
unknown
the
expectation
of
something
inevitable
but
mysterious
terrible
coming
from
without
the
range
of
experience
one
was
to
die
without
doubt
but
how
by
the
sudden
shock
of
collision
crushed
to
death
by
fire
the
conflagration
of
a
world
by
suffocation
the
poisoning
of
the
atmosphere
what
torture
awaited
humanity
apprehension
was
perhaps
more
frightful
than
the
reality
itself

can
not
suffer
beyond
a
certain
limit
to
suffer
by
inches
to
ask
every

what

a
thousand

that

the

on
for
more
than
a
month
the
business
of
the
world
had
been
suspended
a
fortnight
before
the
committee
of
administrators
formerly
the
chamber
and
senate
had
adjourned
every
other
question
having
sunk
into
insignificance
for
a
week
the
exchanges
of
paris
london
new

and
pekin
had
closed
their
doors
what
was
the
use
of
occupying
oneself
with

with
questions
of
internal

foreign
policy
of
revenue
or
of

if
the
end
of

was

indeed
did
one
even
remember
to

ever
taken
any
interest
in

the
courts
themselves
had
no
cases
one
does
not

when
one
expects
the
end
of

humanity
no
longer
attached
importance
to
anything
its

beat
furiously
as
if
about
to
stop
forever
every

was
emaciated
every

discomposed
and
haggard
with
sleeplessness
feminine
coquetry
alone
held
out
but
in
a
superficial
hesitating
furtive
manner
without
thought
of
the
morrow
the
situation
was
indeed
serious
almost
desperate
even
in
the
eyes
of
the
most
stoical
never
in
the
whole
course
of
history
had
the
race
of
adam
found
itself
face
to
face
with
such
a
peril
the
portents
of
the
sky
confronted
it
unceasingly
with
a
question
of
life
and
death
but
let
us
go
back
to
the
beginning
three
months
before
the
day
of
which
we
speak
the
director
of
the
observatory
of
mount
gaurisankar
had
sent
the
following
telephonic
message
to
the
principal
observatories
of
the
globe
and
especially
to
that
of
paris
footnote
for
about
years
the
observatory
of
paris
had
ceased
to
be
an
observing
station
and
had
been
perpetuated
only
as
the
central
administrative
bureau
of
french
astronomy
astronomical
observations
were
made
under
far
more
satisfactory
conditions
upon
mountain
summits
in
a
pure
atmosphere
free
from
disturbing
influences
observers
were
in
direct
and
constant
communication
by
telephone
with
the
central
office
whose
instruments
were
used
only
to
verify
certain
discoveries
or
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
of
savants
detained
in
paris
by
their
sedentary
occupation
a
telescopic
comet
discovered
tonight
in
right
ascension
and
south
declination
slight
diurnal
motion
is
of
greenish
not
a
month
passed
without
the
discovery
of
telescopic
comets
and
their
announcement
to
the
various
observatories
especially
since
the
installation
of
intrepid
astronomers
in
asia
on
the
lofty
peaks
of
gaurisankar
dapsang
and
kanchinjinga
in
south
america
on
aconcagua
illampon
and
chimborazo
as
also
in
africa
on
kilimanjaro
and
in
europe
on
elburz
and
mont
blanc
this
announcement
therefore
had
not
excited
more
comment
among
astronomers
than
any
other
of
a
like
nature
which
they
were
constantly
receiving
a
large
number
of
observers
had
sought
the
comet
in
the
position
indicated
and
had
carefully
followed
its
motion
their
observations
had
been
published
in
the
neuastronomischenachrichten
and
a
german
mathematician
had
calculated
a
provisional
orbit
and
ephemeris
scarcely
had
this
orbit
and
ephemeris
been
published
when
a
japanese
scientist
made
a
very
remarkable
suggestion
according
to
these
calculations
the
comet
was
approaching
the
sun
from
infinite
space
in
a
plane
but
slightly
inclined
to
that
of
the
ecliptic
an
extremely
rare
occurrence
and
moreover
would
traverse
the
orbit
of
saturn
it
would
be
exceedingly
interesting
he
remarked
to
multiply
observations
and
revise
the
calculation
of
the
orbit
with
a
view
to
determining
whether
the
comet
will
come
in
collision
with
the
rings
of
saturn
for
this
planet
will
be
exactly
at
that
point
of
its
path
intersected
by
the
orbit
of
the
comet
on
the
day
of
the
latter
s
illustration
the
young
a
young
laureate
of
the
institute
a
candidate
for
the
directorship
for
the
observatory
acting
at
once
on
this
suggestion
had
installed
herself
at
the
telephone
office
in
order
to
capture
on
the
wing
every
message
in
less
than
ten
days
she
had
intercepted
more
than
one
hundred
despatches
and
without
losing
an
instant
had
devoted
three
nights
and
days
to
a
revision
of
the
orbit
as
based
on
this
entire
series
of
observations
the
result
proved
that
the
german
computor
had
committed
an
error
in
determining
the
perihelion
distance
and
that
the
inference
drawn
by
the
japanese
astronomer
was
inexact
in
so
far
as
the
date
of
the
comet
s
passage
through
the
plane
of
the
ecliptic
was
concerned
this
date
being
five
or
six
days
earlier
than
that
first
announced
but
the
interest
in
the
problem
increased
for
the
minimum
distance
of
the
comet
from
the
earth
seemed
now
less
than
the
japanese
calculator
had
thought
possible
setting
aside
for
the
moment
the
question
of
a
collision
it
was
hoped
that
the
enormous
perturbation
which
would
result
from
the
attraction
of
the
earth
and
moon
would
afford
a
new
method
of
determining
with
exhaustive
precision
the
mass
of
both
these
bodies
and
perhaps
even
throw
important
light
upon
the
density
of
the
earth
s
interior
it
was
indeed
established
that
the
celestial
visitor
was
moving
in
a
plane
nearly
coincident
with
that
of
the
ecliptic
and
would
pass
near
the
system
of
saturn
whose
attraction
would
probably
modify
to
a
sensible
degree
the
primitive
parabolic
orbit
bringing
it
nearer
to
the
belated
planet
but
the
comet
after
traversing
the
orbits
of
jupiter
and
of
mars
was
then
to
enter
exactly
that
described
annually
by
the
earth
about
the
sun
the
interest
of
astronomers
was
not
on
this
account
any
the
less
keen
and
the
young
computor
insisted
more
forcibly
than
ever
upon
the
importance
of
numerous
and
exact
observations
it
was
at
the
observatory
of
gaurisankar
especially
that
the
study
of
the
comet
s
elements
was
prosecuted
on
this
highest
elevation
of
the
globe
at
an
altitude
of
meters
among
eternal
snows
which
by
newly
discovered
processes
of
were
kept
at
a
distance
of
several
kilometers
from
the
station
towering
almost
always
many
hundred
meters
above
the
highest
clouds
in
a
pure
and
rarified
atmosphere
the
visual
power
of
both
the
eye
and
the
telescope
was
increased
a
hundred
fold
the
craters
of
the
moon
the
satellites
of
jupiter
and
the
phases
of
venus
could
be
readily
distinguished
by
the
naked
eye
for
nine
or
ten
generations
several
families
of
astronomers
had
lived
upon
this
asiatic
summit
and
had
gradually
become
accustomed
to
its
rare
atmosphere
the
first
comers
had
succumbed
but
science
and
industry
had
succeeded
in
modifying
the
rigors
of
the
temperature
by
the
storage
of
solar
heat
and
acclimatization
slowly
took
place
as
in
former
times
at
quito
and
bogota
where
in
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
a
contented
population
lived
in
plenty
and
young
women
might
be
seen
dancing
all
night
long
without
fatigue
whereas
on
mont
blanc
in
europe
at
the
same
elevation
a
few
steps
only
were
attended
with
painful
respiration
by
degrees
a
small
colony
was
installed
upon
the
slopes
of
the
himalayas
and
through
their
researches
and
discoveries
the
observatory
had
acquired
the
reputation
of
being
the
first
in
the
world
its
principal
instrument
was
the
celebrated
equatorial
of
one
hundred
meters
focal
length
by
whose
aid
the
hieroglyphic
signals
addressed
in
vain
for
several
thousand
years
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
planet
mars
to
the
earth
had
finally
been
deciphered
while
the
astronomers
of
europe
were
discussing
the
orbit
of
the
new
comet
and
establishing
the
precision
of
the
computations
which
foretold
its
convergence
upon
the
earth
and
the
collision
of
the
two
bodies
in
space
a
new
phonographic
message
was
sent
out
from
the
himalayan
observatory
the
comet
will
soon
become
visible
to
the
naked
eye
still
of
greenish
hue
its
course
is
the
complete
agreement
between
the
astronomical
data
whether
from
european
american
or
asiatic
sources
could
leave
no
further
doubt
of
their
exactness
the
daily
papers
sowed
broadcast
this
alarming
news
embellished
with
sinister
comments
and
numberless
interviews
in
which
the
most
astonishing
statements
were
attributed
to
scientists
their
only
concern
was
to
outdo
the
ascertained
facts
and
to
exaggerate
their
bearing
by
more
or
less
fanciful
additions
as
for
that
matter
the
journals
of
the
world
had
long
since
become
purely
business
enterprises
the
sole
preoccupation
of
each
was
to
sell

of

the
most
eminent

ingenious
these
two
classes
made
no
return
to
the
stockholders
everything
was
adroitly
decked
out
with
the
rhetoric
of
patriotism
a
sentiment
which
still
exercised
some
empire
over
the
minds
of
men
in
short
from
every
point
of
view
the
pecuniary
interests
of
the
publication
dominated
all
considerations

interest

progress

all
this
the
public
had
been
for
a
long
time
the
dupe
but
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
now
speaking
it
had
surrendered
to
the
situation
so
that
there
was
no
longer
any
newspaper
properly
speaking
but
only
sheets
of
notices
and
advertisements
of
a
commercial
nature
neither
the
first
announcement
of
the
press
that
a
comet
was
approaching
with
a
high
velocity
and
would
collide
with
the
earth
at
a
date
already
determined
nor
the
second
that
the
wandering
star
might
bring
about
a
general
catastrophe
by
rendering
the
atmosphere
irrespirable
had
produced
the
slightest
impression
this
prophecy
if
noticed
at
all
by
the
heedless
reader
had
been
received
with
profound
incredulity
attracting
no
more
attention
than
the
simultaneous
announcement
of
the
discovery
of
the
fountain
of
perpetual
youth
in
the
cellars
of
the
palais
des
fées
on
montmartre
erected
on

ruins

shower

astronomers
themselves
had
not
at
first
evinced
any
anxiety
about
the
collision
so
far
as
it
affected
the
fate
of
humanity
and
the
astronomical
journals
which
alone
retained
any
semblance
of
authority
had
as
yet
referred
to
the
subject
simply
as
a
computation
to
be
verified
scientists
had
treated
the
problem
as
one
of
pure
mathematics
regarding
it
only
as
an
interesting
case
of
celestial
mechanics
in
the
interviews
to
which
they
had
been
subjected
they
had
contented
themselves
with
saying
that
a
collision
was
possible
even
probable
but
of
no
interest
to
the
public
meanwhile
a
new
message
was
received
by
telephone
this
time
from
mount
hamilton
in
california
which
produced
a
sensation
among
the
chemists
and
physiologists
spectroscopic
observation

fact
that

comet
is

body
of
considerable
density
composed
of
several
gases

chief
of
which
is
matters
were
becoming
serious
that
a
collision
with
the
earth
would
occur
was
certain
if
astronomers
were
not
especially
preoccupied
by
this
fact
accustomed
as
they
were
for
centuries
to
consider
these
celestial
conjunctions
as
harmless
if
the
most
celebrated
even
of
their
number
had
at
last
coldly
shown
the
door
to
the
many
beardless
reporters
constantly
importuning
them
declaring
that
this
prediction
was
of
no
interest
to
the
people
at
large
and
was
a
strictly
astronomical
question
which
did
not
concern
them
physicians
on
the
other
hand
had
begun
to
agitate
the
subject

so
far
from
turning
a
cold
shoulder
to
the
journalists
they
had
welcomed
them
and
in
a
few
days
the
subject
suddenly
entered
upon
a
new
phase
from
the
domain
of
astronomy
it
had
passed
into
that
of
philosophy
and
the
name
of
every
or
famous
physician
appeared
in
large
letters
on
the
of
the
daily
papers
their
portraits
were
reproduced
in
the
illustrated
journals
and

on
the
comet
was
to
be
seen
on
every
hand
already
even
the
variety
and
diversity
of
conflicting
opinions
had
created
hostile
camps
which
hurled
at
each
other
the
most
grotesque
abuse
and
asserted
that
all
physicians
were
charlatans
eager
for
in
the
mean
time
the
director
of
the
paris
observatory
having
at
heart
the
interests
of
science
was
profoundly
disturbed
by
an
uproar
which
had
more
than
once
on
former
occasions
singularly
misrepresented
astronomical
facts
he
was
a
venerable
old
man
who
had
grown
gray
in
the
study
of
the
great
problems
of
the
constitution
of
the
universe
his
utterances
were
respected
by
all
and
he
had
decided
to
make
a
statement
to
the
press
in
which
he
declared
that
all
conjectures
made
prior
to
the
technical
discussion
authorized
by
the
institute
were
premature
it
has
been
remarked
we
believe
that
the
paris
observatory
always
in
the
van
of
every
scientific
movement
by
virtue
of
the
labors
of
its
members
and
more
especially
of
improved
methods
of
observation
had
become
on
the
one
hand
the
sanctuary
of
theoretical
research
and
on
the
other
the

it
was
an
asylum
of
peace
where
perfect
concord
reigned
where
astronomers
disinterestedly
consecrated
their
whole
lives
to
the
advancement
of
science
and
mutually
encouraged
each
other
without
experiencing
any
of
the
pangs
of
envy
each
forgetting
his
own
merit
to
proclaim
that
of
his
colleagues
the
director
set
the
example
and
when
he
spoke
it
was
in
the
name
of
all
he
published
a
technical
discussion
and
he
was
listened
a
moment
for
the
question
appeared
to
be
no
longer
one
of
astronomy
no
one
denied
or
disputed
the
meeting
of
the
comet
with
the
earth
that
was
a
fact
which
mathematics
had
rendered
certain
the
absorbing
question
now
was
the
chemical
constitution
of
the
comet
if
the
earth
in
its
passage
through
it
was
to
lose
the
oxygen
of
its
atmosphere
death
by
asphyxia
was
inevitable
if
on
the
other
hand
the
nitrogen
was
to
combine
with
the
cometary
gases
death
was
still
certain
but
death
preceded
by
an
ungovernable
exhilaration
a
sort
of
universal
intoxication
a
wild
delirium
of
the
senses
being
the
necessary
result
of
the
extraction
of
nitrogen
from
the
respirable
air
and
the
proportionate
increase
of
oxygen
the
spectroscope
indicated
especially
the
presence
of
in
the
chemical
constitution
of
the
comet
the
chief
point
under
discussion
in
the
scientific
reviews
was
whether
the
mixture
of
this
noxious
gas
with
the
atmosphere
would
poison
the
entire
population
of
the
globe
human
and
animal
as
the
president
of
the
academy
of
medicine
affirmed
would
be
the
case
nothing
else
was
talked
of
the
spectroscope
could
not
be
in
error
its
methods
were
too
sure
its
processes
too
precise
everybody
knew
that
the
smallest
admixture
of
this
gas
with
the
air
we
breathe
meant
a
speedy
death
now
a
later
despatch
from
the
observatory
of
gaurisankar
had
more
than
confirmed
that
received
from
mount
hamilton
this
despatch
read
the
earth
will
be
completely
submerged
in
the
nucleus
of
the
comet
whose
diameter
is
already
thirty
times
that
of
the
globe
and
is
daily
thirty
times
the
diameter
of
the
earth
even
then
though
the
comet
should
pass
between
the
earth
and
the
moon
it
would
touch
them
both
since
a
bridge
of
thirty
earths
would
span
the
distance
between
our
world
and
the
moon
then
too
during
the
three
months
whose
history
we
have
recapitulated
the
comet
had
emerged
from
regions
accessible
only
to
the
telescope
and
had
become
visible
to
the
naked
eye
in
full
view
of
the
earth
it
hovered
now
like
a
threat
from
heaven
among
the
army
of
stars
terror
itself
advancing
slowly
but
inexorably
was
suspended
like
a
mighty
sword
above
every
head
a
last
effort
was
made
not
indeed
to
turn
the
comet
from
its
idea
conceived
by
that
class
of
visionaries
who
recoil
before
nothing
and
who
had
even
imagined
that
an
electric
storm
of
vast
magnitude
might
be
produced
by
batteries
suitably
distributed
over
that
face
of
the
globe
which
was
to
receive
the
to
examine
once
more
the
great
problem
under
every
aspect
and
perhaps
to
reassure
the
public
mind
and
rekindle
hope
by
the
discovery
of
some
error
in
the
conclusions
which
had
been
drawn
some
forgotten
fact
in
the
observations
or
computations
this
collision
might
not
after
all
prove
so
fatal
as
the
pessimists
had
foretold
a
general
presentation
of
the
case
from
every
point
of

was
announced
for
this
very

let

ourselves

this

the

had
emerged
slowly
from
the
depths
of

instead
of
appearing
suddenly
as
more
than
once
the
great
comets
have
been
observed
to
do
because
coming
into
view
immediately
after
their
perihelion

after
a
long
series

had
at
first
remained
in
regions
visible
only
to
the
telescope
and
had
been
watched
only
by
astronomers
for
several
days
after
its
discovery
none
but
the
most
powerful
equatorials
of
the
observatories
could
detect
its
presence
but
the
were
not
slow
to
examine
it
for
themselves
every
modern
house
was
crowded
with
a
terrace
partly
for
the
purpose
of
facilitating
aerial
embarkations
many
of
them
were
provided
with
revolving
domes
few
families
were
without
a
telescope
and
no
home
was
complete
without
a
library
well
furnished
with
scientific
books
the
comet
had
been
observed
by
everybody
so
to
speak
from
the
instant
it
became
visible
to
instruments
of
moderate
power
as
for
the
laboring
classes
whose
leisure
moments
were
always
provided
for
the
telescopes
set
up
in
the
public
squares
had
been
surrounded
by
impatient
crowds
from
the
first
moment
of
visibility
and
every
evening
the
receipts
of
these
astronomers
of
the
open
air
had
been
incredible
and
without
precedent
many
workmen
too
had
their
own
instruments
especially
in
the
provinces
and
justice
as
well
as
truth
compels
us
to
acknowledge
that
the
first
discoverer
of
the
comet
outside
of
the
professional
observers
had
not
been
a
man
of
the
world
a
person
of
importance
or
an
academician
but
a
plain
workman
of
the
town
of
soissons
who
passed
the
greater
portion
of
his
nights
under
the
stars
and
who
had
succeeded
in
purchasing
out
of
his
laboriously
accumulated
savings
an
excellent
little
telescope
with
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
studying
the
wonders
of
the
sky
and
it
is
a
notable
fact
that
prior
to
the
century
nearly
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
had
lived
without
knowing
where
they
were
without
even
feeling
the
curiosity
to
ask
like
blind
men
with
no
other
preoccupation
than
the
satisfaction
of
their
appetites
but
within
a
hundred
years
the
human
race
had
begun
to
observe
and
reason
upon
the
universe
about
them
illustration
to
understand
the
path
of
the
comet
through
space
it
will
be
sufficient
to
examine
carefully
the
accompanying
chart
it
represents
the
comet
coming
from
infinite
space
obliquely
towards
the
earth
and
afterwards
falling
into
the
sun
which
does
not
arrest
it
in
its
passage
toward
perihelion
no
account
has
been
taken
of
the
perturbation
caused
by
the
earth
s
attraction
whose
effect
would
be
to
bring
the
comet
nearer
to
the
earth
s
orbit
all
the
comets
which
gravitate
about
the
they
are
similar
elongated
orbits
one
of
whose
foci
is
occupied
by
the
solar
star
the
drawing
on
page
gives
an
idea
of
the
intersections
of
the
cometary
and
planetary
orbits
and
the
orbit
of
the
earth
about
the
sun
on
studying
these
intersections
we
perceive
that
a
collision
is
neither
an
impossible
nor
an
abnormal
event
the
comet
was
now
visible
to
the
naked
eye
on
the
night
of
the
new
moon
the
atmosphere
being
perfectly
clear
it
had
been
detected
by
a
few
keen
eyes
without
the
aid
of
a
glass
not
far
from
the
zenith
near
the
edge
of
the
milky
way

the
south
of

quite

almost
round
slightly
elongated

a

that

the

elongation

a
rudimentary

this
indeed
had
been
its
appearance
since
its
first
discovery
by
the
telescope
from
its
inoffensive
aspect
no
one
could
have
suspected
the
tragic
role
which
this
new
star
was
to
play
in
the
history
of
humanity
analysis
alone
indicated
its
march
toward
the
earth
but
the
mysterious
star
approached
rapidly
the
very
next
day
the
half
of
those
who
searched
for
it
had
detected
it
and
the
following
day
only
the
with
eyeglasses
of
insufficient
power
had
failed
to
make
it
out
in
less
than
a
week

one
had
seen
it
in
all
the
public
squares
in
every
city
in
every
village
groups
were
to
be
seen
watching
it
or
showing
it
to
others
day
by
day
it
increased
in
size
the
telescope
began
to
distinguish
distinctly
a
luminous
nucleus
the
excitement
increased
at
the
same
time
invading
every
mind
when
after
the
first
quarter
and
during
the
full
moon
it
appeared
to
remain
stationary
and
even
to
lose
something
of
its
brilliancy
as
it
had
been
expected
to
grow
rapidly
larger
it
was
hoped
that
some
error
had
crept
into
the
computations
and
a
period
of
tranquillity
and
relief
followed
after

full

was
not
without

men
waited
for
the
setting
of
the

several
aerial
expeditions
had
succeeded
in
rising
above
the
and
aeronauts
had
asserted
that
the
comet
was
visibly
larger
telephone
messages
sent
out
from
the
mountains
of

announced
also
its
rapid
approach
but
great
was
the
surprise
when
at
nightfall
every
eye
was
turned
heavenward
to
seek
the
flaming
star
it
was
no
longer
a
comet
a
classic
comet
such
as
one
had
seen
before
but
an
aurora
borealis
of
a
new
kind
a
gigantic
celestial
fan
with
seven
branches
shooting
into
space
seven
greenish
streamers
which
appeared
to
issue
from
a
point
hidden
below
the
horizon
no
one
had
the
slightest
doubt
but
that
this
fantastical
aurora
borealis
was
the
comet
itself
a
view
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
the
former
comet
could
not
be
found
anywhere
among
the
starry
host
the
apparition
differed
it
is
true
from
all
popularly
known
cometary
forms
and
the
radiating
beams
of
the
mysterious
visitor
were
of
all
forms
the
least
expected
but
these
gaseous
bodies
are
so
remarkable
so
capricious
so
various
that
everything
is
possible
moreover
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
a
comet
had
presented
such
an
aspect
astronomy
contained
among
its
records
that
of
an
immense
comet
observed
in
which
at
that
time
had
been
the
subject
of
much
discussion
and
whose
picturesque
delineation
made
de
visu
by
the
astronomer
chèzeaux
at
lausanne
had
given
it
a
wide
celebrity
but
even
if
nothing
of
this
nature
had
been
seen
before
the
evidence
of
one
s
eyes
was
indubitable
meanwhile
discussions
multiplied
and
a
veritable
astronomical
tournament
was
commenced
in
the
scientific
reviews
of
the
entire
only
journals
which
inspired
any
confidence
amid
the
epidemic
of
buying
and
selling
which
had
for
so
long
a
time
possessed
humanity
the
main
question
now
that
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
that
the
star
was
moving
straight
toward
the
earth
was
its
position
from
day
to
day
a
question
depending
upon
its
velocity
the
young
computor
of
the
paris
observatory
chief
of
the
section
of
comets
sent
every
day
a
note
to
the
official
journal
of
the
united
states
of
europe
illustration
a
very
simple
mathematical
relation
exists
between
the
velocity
of
every
comet
and
its
distance
from
the
sun
knowing
the
former
one
can
at
once
find
the
latter
in
fact
the
velocity
of
the
comet
is
simply
the
velocity
of
a
planet
multiplied
by
the
square
root
of
two
now
the
velocity
of
a
planet
whatever
its
distance
is
determined
by
kepler
s
third
law
according
to
which
the
squares
of
the
times
of
revolution
are
to
each
other
as
the
cubes
of
the
distances
nothing
evidently
can
be
more
simple
thus
for
example
the
magnificent
planet
jupiter
moves
about
the
sun
with
a
velocity
of
meters
per
second
a
comet
at
this
distance
moves
therefore
with
the
velocity
multiplied
by
the
square
root
of
two
that
is
to
say
by
the
number
this
velocity
is
consequently
meters
per
second
the
planet
mars
revolves
about
the
sun
at
the
rate
of
meters
per
second
at
this
distance
the
comet
s
velocity
is
meters
per
second
the
mean
velocity
of
the
earth
in
its
orbit
is
meters
per
second
a
little
less
in
june
a
little
more
in
december
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
earth
therefore
the
velocity
of
the
comet
is
meters
independently
of
the
acceleration
which
the
earth
might
occasion
these
facts
the
laureate
of
the
institute
called
to
the
attention
of
the
public
which
moreover
already
possessed
some
general
notions
upon
the
theory
of
celestial
mechanics
when
the
threatening
star
arrived
at
a
distance
from
the
sun
equal
to
that
of
mars
the
popular
fear
was
no
longer
a
vague
apprehension
it
took
definite
form
based
as
it
was
upon
the
exact
knowledge
of
the
comet
s
rate
of
approach
thousand
meters
per
second
meant
kilometers
per
minute
or
kilometers
per
hour
illustration
as
the
distance
of
the
orbit
of
mars
from
that
of
the
earth
is
only
of
kilometers
at
the
rate
of
kilometers
an
hour
this
distance
would
be
covered
in
hours
or
about
days
but
as
the
comet
approached
the
sun
its
velocity
would
increase
since
at
the
distance
of
the
earth
its
velocity
would
be
meters
per
second
in
virtue
of
this
increase
of
speed
the
distance
between
the
two
orbits
would
be
traversed
by
a
comet
in
hours
or
in
days
six
hours
but
the
earth
at
the
moment
of
meeting
with
the
comet
would
not
be
exactly
at
that
point
of
its
orbit
intersected
by
a
line
from
the
comet
to
the
sun
because
the
former
was
not
advancing
directly
toward
the
latter
the
collision
therefore
would
not
take
place
for
nearly
a
week
later
namely
at
about
midnight
on
friday
the
of
july
it
is
unnecessary
to
add
that
under
such
circumstances
the
usual
arrangements
for
the
celebration
of
the
national
fête
of
july
had
been
forgotten
national
fête
no
one
thought
of
it
was
not
that
date
far
more
likely
to
mark
the
universal
doom
of
men
and
things
as
to
that
the
celebration
by
the
french
of
the
anniversary
of
that
famous
day
had
some
exceptions
it
is
more
than
five
centuries
even
among
the
romans
anniversaries
had
never
been
observed
for
so
long
a
period
and
it
was
generally
agreed
that
the
of
july
had
outlived
its
usefulness
it
was
now
monday
the
of
july
for
five
days
the
sky
had
been
perfectly
clear
and
every
night
the
comet
hovered
in
the
sky
depths
its
head
or
nucleus
distinctly
visible
and
dotted
with
luminous
points
which
might
well
be
solid
bodies
several
kilometers
in
diameter
and
which
according
to
the
calculations
would
be
the
first
to
strike
the
earth
the
tail
being
in
a
direction
away
from
the
sun
and
in
the
present
instance
behind
and
obliquely
situated
with
reference
to
the
direction
of
motion
the
new
star
blazed
in
the
constellation
of
pisces
according
to
observations
taken
on
the
preceding
evening
july
its
exact
position
was
right
ascension
declination
north
the
tail
lay
entirely
across
the
constellation
of
pegasus
the
comet
rose
at
and
was
visible
all
night
long
during
the
lull
of
which
we
have
spoken
a
change
in
public
opinion
had
occurred
from
a
series
of
retrospective
calculations
an
astronomer
had
proved
that
the
earth
had
already
on
several
occasions
encountered
comets
and
that
each
time
the
only
result
had
been
a
harmless
shower
of
shooting
stars
but
one
of
his
colleagues
had
replied
that
the
present
comet
could
not
in
any
sense
be
compared
to
a
swarm
of
meteors
that
it
was
gaseous
with
a
nucleus
composed
of
solid
bodies
and
he
had
in
this
connection
recalled
the
observations
made
upon
a
comet
famous
in
history
that
of
this
comet
of
justified
in
a
certain
respect
a
real
apprehension
its
dimensions
were
recalled
to
mind
its
length
of
kilometers
that
is
to
say
a
distance
greater
than
that
of
the
earth
from
the
sun
and
the
width
of
its
tail
at
its
extreme
point
kilometers
the
diameter
of
its
nucleus
measured
kilometers
forty
thousand
times
that
of
the
earth
and
its
nebulous
and
remarkably
regular
elliptical
head
was
a
spot
brilliant
as
a
star
having
itself
a
diameter
of
no
less
than
kilometers
the
spot
appeared
to
be
of
great
density
it
was
observed
for
sixteen
months
and
days
but
the
most
remarkable
feature
of
this
comet
was
the
immense
development
to
which
it
attained
without
approaching
very
close
to
the
sun
for
it
did
not
reach
a
point
nearer
than
kilometers
and
thus
remained
more
than
kilometers
from
the
earth
as
the
size
of
comets
increases
as
they
near
the
sun
if
this
one
had
experienced
to
a
greater
degree
the
solar
action
its
appearance
would
certainly
have
been
still
more
wonderful
and
doubtless
terrifying
to
the
observer
and
as
its
mass
was
far
from
insignificant
if
it
had
fallen
directly
into
the
sun
its
velocity
accelerated
to
the
rate
of
five
or
six
hundred
thousand
meters
per
second
at
the
moment
of
collision
might
by
the
transformation
of
mechanical
energy
into
thermal
energy
have
suddenly
increased
the
solar
radiations
to
such
a
degree
as
to
have
utterly
destroyed
in
a
few
days
every
trace
of
vegetable
and
animal
life
upon
the
earth
a
physicist
indeed
had
made
this
curious
remark
that
a
comet
of
the
same
size
as
that
of
or
greater
might
thus
bring
about
the
end
of
the
world
without
actual
contact
by
a
sort
of
expulsion
of
solar
light
and
heat
analogous
to
that
observed
in
the
case
of
temporary
stars
the
impact
would
indeed
give
rise
to
a
quantity
of
heat
six
times
as
great
as
that
which
would
be
produced
by
the
combustion
of
a
mass
of
coal
equal
to
the
mass
of
the
comet
it
had
been
shown
that
if
such
a
comet
in
its
flight
instead
of
falling
into
the
sun
should
collide
with
our
planet
the
end
of
the
world
would
be
by
fire
if
it
collided
with
jupiter
it
would
raise
the
temperature
of
that
globe
to
such
a
point
as
to
restore
to
it
its
lost
light
and
to
make
it
for
a
time
a
sun
again
so
that
the
earth
would
be
lighted
by
two
suns
jupiter
becoming
a
sort
of
minor
far
brighter
than
the
moon
and
shining
by
its
own
a
or
garnet
color
revolving
about
the
earth
in
twelve
years
a
nocturnal
sun
that
is
to
say
no
more
real
night
for
the
earth
the
most
classical
astronomical
treatises
had
been
consulted

on

written
by

overwhelmed
by

violent

are
the
disasters
which
might
result
from
collision
with
a
thus
discussion
researches
into
the
past
calculations
conjectures
succeeded
each
other
but
that
which
made
the
deepest
impression
on
every
mind
was
first
that
as
proved
by
observation
the
present
comet
had
a
nucleus
of
considerable
density
and
second
that
gas
was
unquestionably
the
chief
chemical
constituent
fear
and
terror
resumed
their
sway
nothing
else
was
thought
of
or
talked
about
but
the
comet
already
inventive
minds
sought
some
way
more
or
less
practicable
of
evading
the
danger
chemists
pretended
to
be
able
to
preserve
a
part
of
the
oxygen
of
the
atmosphere
methods
were
devised
for
the
isolation
of
this
gas
from
the
nitrogen
and
its
storage
in
immense
vessels
of
glass
hermetically
sealed
a
clever
pharmacist
asserted
that
he
had
condensed
it
in
pastilles
and
in
a
fortnight
expended
eight
millions
in
advertising
thus
commerce
made
capital
out
of
everything
even
universal
death
all
hope
was
not
however
abandoned
people
disputed
trembled
grew
anxious
shuddered
died
hoped
on
the
latest
news
was
to
the
effect
that
the
comet
developing
as
it
approached
the
thermal
and
electric
influences
of
the
sun
would
have
at
the
moment
of
impact
a
diameter
times
that
of
the
earth
or
kilometers
it
was
in
the
midst
of
this
state
of
general
anxiety
that
the
session
of
the
institute
whose
utterance
was
awaited
as
the
last
word
of
an
oracle
was
opened
the
director
of
the
observatory
of
paris
was
naturally
to
be
the
first
speaker
but
what
seemed
to
excite
the
greatest
interest
in
the
public
was
the
opinion
of
the
president
of
the
academy
of
medicine
on
the
probable
effects
of
the
president
of
the
geological
society
of
france
was
also
to
make
an
address
and
the
general
object
of
the
session
was
to
pass
in
review
all
the
possible
ways
in
which
our
earth
might
come
to
an
end
evidently
however
the
discussion
of
its
collision
with
the
comet
would
hold
the
first
place

frightened
as
we
have
just
seen
the
threatening
star
hung
above
every
head
everybody
could
see
it
it
was
growing
larger
day
by
day
it
was
approaching
with
an
increasing
velocity
it
was
known
to
be
at
a
distance
of
only
kilometers
and
that
this
distance
would
be
passed
over
in
five
days
every
hour
brought
this
menacing
hand
ready
to
strike
kilometers
nearer
in
six
days
anxious
humanity
would
breathe
not
at
all

before

fixed

the

opened

as

it
is
needless
to
remind
the
reader
that
the
language
of
the
xxxvth
century
is
here
translated
into
that
of
the
xixth
ladies
and
gentlemen
you
all
know
the
object
for
which
we
are
assembled
never
certainly
has
humanity
passed
through
such
a
crisis
as
this
never
indeed
has
this
historic
room
of
the
twentieth
century
contained
such
an
audience
the
great
problem
of
the
end
of
the
world
has
been
for
a
fortnight
the
single
object
of
discussion
and
study
among
savants
the
results
of
their
discussions
and
researches
are
now
to
be
announced
without
further
preamble
i
give
place
to
the
director
of
the
the
astronomer
immediately
arose
holding
a
few
notes
in
his
hand
he
had
an
easy
address
an
agreeable
voice
and
a
pleasant
countenance
his
gestures
were
few
and
his
expression
pleasing
he
had
a
broad
forehead
and
a
magnificent
head
of
curling
white
hair
framed
his
face
he
was
a
man
of
learning
and
of
culture
as
well
as
of
science
and
his
whole
personality
inspired
both
sympathy
and
respect
his
temperament
was
evidently
optimistic
even
under
circumstances
of
great
peril
scarcely
had
he
begun
to
speak
when
the
mournful
and
anxious
faces
before
him
became
suddenly
calm
and
reassured
ladies
he
began
i
address
myself
first
to
you
begging
you
not
to
tremble
in
this
way
before
a
danger
which
may
well
be
less
terrible
than
it
seems
i
hope
presently
to
convince
you
by
the
arguments
which
i
shall
have
the
honor
to
lay
before
you
that
the
comet
whose
approach
is
expected
by
the
entire
race
will
not
involve
the
total
ruin
of
the
earth
doubtless
we
may
and
should
expect
some
catastrophe
but
as
for
the
end
of
the
world
really
everything
would
lead
us
to
believe
that
it
will
not
take
place
in
this
manner
worlds
die
of
old
age
not
by
accident
and
ladies
you
know
better
than
i
that
the
world
is
far
from
being
old
gentlemen
i
see
before
me
representatives
of
every
social
sphere
from
the
highest
to
the
most
humble
before
a
danger
so
apparent
threatening
the
destruction
of
all
life
it
is
not
surprising
that
every
business
operation
should
be
absolutely
suspended
nevertheless
as
for
myself
i
confess
that
if
the
bourse
was
not
closed
and
if
i
had
never
had
the
misfortune
to
be
interested
in
speculation
i
should
not
hesitate
today
to
purchase
securities
which
have
fallen
so
this
sentence
was
finished
before
a
noted
american
prince
of
of
the
journal
the
century
occupying
a
seat
on
one
of
the
upper
steps
of
the
amphitheater
forced
his
way
one
hardly
knows
how
through
the
rows
of
benches
and
rolled
like
a
ball
to
the
corridor
leading
to
an
exit
through
which
he
disappeared
illustration
the
prince
of
finance
leaving
the
after
the
momentary
interruption
caused
by
this
unexpected
sequel
to
a
purely
scientific
remark
the
orator
resumed
our
subject
he
said
may
be
considered
under
three
heads
is
the
collision
of
the
comet
with
the
earth
certain
if
this
question
is
answered
in
the
affirmative
we
shall
have
to
examine
the
nature
of
the
comet
and
the
possible
effects
of
a
collision
i
have
no
need
to
remind
so
intelligent
an
audience
as
this
that
the
prophetic
words
end
of
the
world
so
often
heard
today
signify
solely
end
of
the
earth
which
moment
indeed
of
all
others
has
the
most
interest
for
us
if
we
are
able
to
answer
the
first
question
in
the
negative
it
will
be
quite
superfluous
to
consider
the
other
two
which
would
become
of
secondary
interest
unfortunately
i
must
admit
that
the
calculations
of
the
astronomers
are
in
this
case
as
usual
entirely
correct
yes
the
comet
will
strike
the
earth
and
doubtless
with
maximum
force
since
the
impact
will
be
direct
the
velocity
of
the
earth
is
meters
per
second
that
of
the
comet
is
meters
plus
the
acceleration
due
to
the
attraction
of
our
planet
the
initial
velocity
of
contact
therefore
will
be
meters
per
second
the
collision
is
inevitable
with
all
its
consequences
if
the
impact
of
the
comet
is
direct
but
it
will
be
slightly
oblique
but
do
not
for
this
reason
take
matters
so
to
heart
in
itself
the
collision
proves
nothing
if
it
were
announced
for
example
that
a
railway
train
was
to
encounter
a
swarm
of
flies
this
prediction
would
not
greatly
trouble
the
traveller
it
may
well
be
that
the
collision
of
our
earth
with
this
nebulous
star
will
be
of
the
same
nature
permit
me
now
to
examine
calmly
the
two
remaining
questions
first
what
is
the
nature
of
the
comet
that
everyone
knows
already
it
is
a
gas
whose
principal
constituent
is
invisible
under
ordinary
conditions
at
the
temperature
of
stellar
space
degrees
below
zero
this
gas
is
in
a
state
of
vapor
even
of
solid
particles
the
comet
is
saturated
with
them
i
shall
not
in
this
matter
dispute
in
the
least
the
discoveries
of
this
confession
deepened
anew
the
painful
expression
on
the
faces
of
most
of
the
audience
and
here
a
long
sigh
was
drawn
but
gentlemen
resumed
the
astronomer
until
one
of
our
eminent
colleagues
of
the
section
of
physiology
or
of
the
academy
of
medicine
deigns
to
prove
for
us
that
the
density
of
the
comet
is
sufficient
to
admit
of
its
penetration
into
our
atmosphere
i
do
not
believe
that
its
presence
is
likely
to
exert
a
fatal
influence
upon
human
life
i
say
is
likely
for
it
is
not
possible
to
affirm
this
with
certainty
although
the
probability
is
very
great
one
might
perhaps
wager
a
million
to
one
in
any
case
only
those
affected
with
weak
lungs
will
be
victims
it
will
be
a
simple
influenza
which
may
increase
three
or
fivefold
the
daily
death
rate
if
however
as
the
telescope
and
camera
agree
in
indicating
the
nucleus
contains
large
mineral
masses
probably
of
a
metallic
nature
uranolites
measuring
several
kilometers
in
diameter
and
weighing
some
millions
of
tons
one
can
not
but
admit
that
the
localities
where
these
masses
will
fall
with
the
velocity
referred
to
a
moment
ago
would
be
utterly
destroyed
let
us
observe
however
that
of
the
globe
is
covered
with
water
here
again
is
a
contingency
not
so
important
doubtless
as
the
first
but
nevertheless
in
our
favor
these
masses
may
perhaps
fall
into
the
sea
forming
possibly
new
islands
of
foreign
origin
bringing
in
any
case
elements
new
to
science
and
it
may
be
germs
of
unknown
life
geodesy
would
in
this
case
be
interested
and
the
form
and
rotary
movement
of
the
earth
might
be
modified
let
us
note
also
that
not
a
few
deserts
mark
the
earth
s
surface
danger
exists
assuredly
but
it
is
not
overwhelming
illustration
a
few
cities
in
ashes
can
not
arrest
the
history
of
besides
these
masses
and
these
gases
perhaps
also
the
bolides
of
which
we
were
speaking
coming
in
clouds
will
kindle
conflagrations
at
various
places
on
the
continents
dynamite
nitroglycerine
panclastite
and
royalite
would
be
playthings
in
comparison
with
what
may
overtake
us
but
this
does
not
imply
a
universal
cataclysm
a
few
cities
in
ashes
can
not
arrest
the
history
of
humanity
you
see
gentlemen
from
this
methodical
examination
of
the
three
points
before
us
it
follows
that
the
danger
while
it
exists
and
is
even
imminent
is
not
so
great
so
overwhelming
so
certain
as
is
asserted
i
will
even
say
more
this
curious
astronomical
event
which
sets
so
many
hearts
beating
and
fills
with
anxiety
so
many
minds
in
the
eyes
of
the
philosopher
scarcely
changes
the
usual
aspect
of
things
each
one
of
us
must
some
day
die
and
this
certainty
does
not
prevent
us
from
living
tranquilly
why
should
the
apprehension
of
a
somewhat
more
speedy
death
disturb
the
serenity
of
so
many
of
us
is
the
thought
of
our
dying
together
so
disagreeable
this
should
prove
rather
a
consolation
to
our
egotism
no
it
is
the
thought
that
a
stupendous
catastrophe
is
to
shorten
our
lives
by
a
few
days
or
years
life
is
short
and
each
clings
to
the
smallest
fraction
of
it
it
would
even
seem
from
what
one
hears
that
each
would
prefer
to
see
the
whole
world
perish
provided
he
himself
survived
rather
than
die
alone
and
know
the
world
was
saved
this
is
pure
egoism
but
gentlemen
i
am
firm
in
the
belief
that
this
will
be
only
a
partial
disaster
of
the
highest
scientific
importance
but
leaving
behind
it
historians
to
tell
its
story
there
will
be
a
collision
shock
and
local
ruin
it
will
be
the
history
of
an
earthquake
of
a
volcanic
eruption
of
a
thus
spoke
the
illustrious
astronomer
the
audience
appeared
satisfied
calmed
part
at
least
it
was
no
longer
the
question
of
the
absolute
end
of
all
things
but
of
a
catastrophe
from
which
after
all
one
would
probably
escape
whispered
murmurs
of
conversation
were
to
be
heard
people
confided
to
each
other
their
impressions
merchants
and
politicians
even
seemed
to
have
perfectly
understood
the
arguments
advanced
when
at
the
invitation
of
the
presiding
officer
the
president
of
the
academy
of
medicine
was
seen
advancing
slowly
toward
the
tribune
illustration
he
was
a
tall
spare
he
was
a
tall
man
spare
slender
erect
with
a
sallow
face
and
ascetic
appearance
and
melancholy
and
wearing
gray
his
voice
had
something
cadaverous
about
it
and
his
whole
personality
called
to
mind
the
undertaker
rather
than
the
physician
fired
with
the
hope
of
curing
his
patients
his
estimate
of
affairs
was
very
different
from
that
of
the
astronomer
as
was
apparent
from
the
very
first
word
he
uttered
gentlemen
said
he
i
shall
be
as
brief
as
the
eminent
savant
to
whom
we
have
just
listened
although
i
have
passed
many
a
night
in
analyzing
to
the
minutest
detail
the
properties
of
it
is
about
this
gas
that
i
shall
speak
to
you
since
science
has
demonstrated
that
it
is
the
chief
constituent
of
the
comet
and
that
a
collision
with
the
earth
is
inevitable
these
properties
are
terrible
why
not
confess
it
for
the
most
infinitesimal
quantity
of
this
gas
in
the
air
we
breathe
is
sufficient
to
arrest
in
three
minutes
the
normal
action
of
the
lungs
and
to
destroy
life
everybody
knows
that
known
in
chemistry
as
co
is
a
permanent
gas
without
odor
color
or
taste
and
nearly
insoluble
in
water
its
density
in
comparison
with
the
air
is
it
burns
in
the
air
with
a
blue
flame
of
slight
illuminating
power
like
a
funereal
fire
the
product
of
this
combustion
being
carbonic
anhydride
its
most
notable
property
is
its
tendency
to
absorb
oxygen
the
orator
dwelt
upon
these
two
words
with
great
emphasis
in
the
great
iron
furnaces
for
example
carbon
in
the
presence
of
an
insufficient
quantity
of
air
becomes
transformed
into
and
it
is
subsequently
this
oxide
which
reduces
the
iron
to
a
metallic
state
by
depriving
it
of
the
oxygen
with
which
it
was
combined
in
the
sunlight
combines
with
chlorine
and
gives
rise
to
an
oxychlorine
gas
with
a
disagreeable
suffocating
odor
the
fact
which
deserves
our
more
serious
attention
is
that
this
gas
is
of
the
most
poisonous
more
so
than
carbonic
anhydride
its
effect
upon
the
hemoglobin
is
to
diminish
the
respiratory
capacity
of
the
blood
and
even
in
very
small
doses
by
its
cumulative
effect
hinders
to
a
degree
altogether
out
of
proportion
to
the
apparent
cause
the
oxygenizing
properties
of
the
blood
for
example
blood
which
absorbs
from
to
cubic
centimeters
of
oxygen
per
hundred
volumes
absorbs
only
as
much
in
an
atmosphere
which
contains
less
than
part
of
the
part
even
has
a
deleterious
effect
sensibly
diminishing
the
respiratory
action
of
the
blood
the
result
is
not
simple
asphyxia
but
an
almost
instantaneous
acts
directly
upon
the
blood
corpuscles
combining
with
them
and
rendering
them
unfit
to
sustain
life
hematosis
that
is
the
conversion
of
venous
into
arterial
blood
is
arrested
three
minutes
are
sufficient
to
produce
death
the
circulation
of
the
blood
ceases
the
black
venous
blood
fills
the
arteries
as
well
as
the
veins
the
latter
especially
those
of
the
brain
become
surcharged
the
substance
of
the
brain
becomes
punctured
the
base
of
the
tongue
the
larynx
the
the
bronchial
tubes
become
red
with
blood
and
soon
the
entire
body
presents
the
characteristic
purple
appearance
which
results
from
the
suspension
of
hematosis
but
gentlemen
the
injurious
properties
of
are
not
the
only
ones
to
be
feared
the
mere
tendency
of
this
gas
to
absorb
oxygen
would
bring
about
fatal
results
to
suppress
nay
even
only
to
diminish
oxygen
would
suffice
for
the
extinction
of
the
human
species
everyone
here
present
is
familiar
with
that
incident
which
with
so
many
others
marks
the
epoch
of
barbarism
when
men
assassinated
each
other
legally
in
the
name
of
glory
and
of
patriotism
it
is
a
simple
episode
of
one
of
the
english
wars
in
india
permit
me
to
recall
it
to
your
memory
one
hundred
and
prisoners
had
been
confined
in
a
room
whose
only
outlets
were
two
small
windows
opening
upon
a
corridor
the
first
effect
experienced
by
these
unfortunate
captives
was
a
free
and
persistent
perspiration
followed
by
insupportable
thirst
and
soon
by
great
difficulty
in
breathing
they
sought
in
various
ways
to
get
more
room
and
air
they
divested
themselves
of
their
clothes
they
beat
the
air
with
their
hats
and
finally
resorted
to
kneeling
and
rising
together
at
intervals
of
a
few
seconds
but
each
time
some
of
those
whose
strength
failed
them
fell
and
were
trampled
under
the
feet
of
their
comrades
before
midnight
that
is
during
the
fourth
hour
of
their
confinement
all
who
were
still
living
and
who
had
not
succeeded
in
obtaining
purer
air
at
the
windows
had
fallen
into
a
lethargic
stupor
or
a
frightful
delirium
when
a
few
hours
later
the
prison
door
was
opened
only
men
came
out
alive
they
were
in
the
most
pitiable
state
imaginable
every
face
wearing
the
impress
of
the
death
from
which
they
had
barely
escaped
illustration
the
black
hole
of
i
might
add
a
thousand
other
examples
but
it
would
be
useless
for
doubt
upon
this
point
is
impossible
i
therefore
affirm
gentlemen
that
on
the
one
hand
the
absorption
by
the
of
a
portion
of
the
atmospheric
oxygen
or
on
the
other
the
powerfully
toxic
properties
of
this
gas
upon
the
vital
elements
of
the
blood
alike
seem
to
me
to
give
to
the
meeting
of
our
globe
with
the
immense
mass
of
the
the
heart
of
which
we
shall
be
plunged
for
several
affirm
i
repeat
that
this
meeting
involves
consequences
absolutely
fatal
for
my
part
i
see
no
chance
of
escape
i
have
not
spoken
of
the
transformation
of
mechanical
motion
into
heat
or
of
the
mechanical
and
chemical
consequences
of
the
collision
i
leave
this
aspect
of
the
question
to
the
permanent
secretary
of
the
academy
of
sciences
and
to
the
learned
president
of
the
astronomical
society
of
france
who
have
made
it
the
subject
of
important
investigations
as
for
me
i
repeat
terrestrial
life
is
in
danger
and
i
see
not
one
only
but
two
three
and
four
mortal
perils
confronting
it
escape
will
be
a
miracle
and
for
centuries
no
one
has
believed
in
this
speech
uttered
with
the
tone
of
conviction
in
a
clear
calm
and
solemn
voice
again
plunged
the
entire
audience
into
a
state
of
mind
from
which
the
preceding
address
had
happily
released
them
the
certainty
of
the
approaching
disaster
was
painted
upon
every
face
some
had
become
yellow
almost
green
others
suddenly
became
scarlet
and
seemed
on
the
verge
of
apoplexy
some
few
among
the
audience
appeared
to
have
retained
their
through
scepticism
or
a
philosophic
effort
to
make
the
best
of
it
a
vast
murmur
filled
the
room
everyone
whispered
his
opinions
to
his
neighbor
opinions
generally
more
optimistic
than
sincere
for
no
one
likes
to
appear
afraid
the
president
of
the
astronomical
society
of
france
rose
in
his
turn
and
advanced
toward
the
tribune
instantly
every
murmur
was
hushed
below
we
give
the
main
points
of
his
speech
including
the
opening
remarks
and
the
peroration
ladies
and
gentlemen
after
the
statements
which
we
have
just
heard
no
doubt
can
remain
in
any
mind
as
to
the
certainty
of
the
collision
of
the
comet
with
the
earth
and
the
dangers
attending
this
event
we
must
therefore
expect
on
on
friday
interrupted
a
voice
from
the
desk
of
the
institute
on
saturday
i
repeat
continued
the
orator
without
noticing
the
interruption
an
extraordinary
event
one
absolutely
unique
in
the
history
of
the
world
i
say
saturday
although
the
papers
announce
that
the
collision
will
take
place
on
friday
because
it
can
not
occur
before
july
i
passed
the
entire
night
with
my
learned
colleague
in
comparing
the
observations
received
and
we
discovered
an
error
in
their
this
statement
produced
a
sensation
of
relief
among
the
audience
it
was
like
a
slender
ray
of
light
in
the
middle
of
a
somber
night
a
single
day
of
respite
is
of
enormous
importance
to
one
condemned
to
death
already
chimerical
projects
formed
in
every
mind
the
catastrophe
was
put
off
it
was
a
kind
of
reprieve
it
was
not
remembered
that
this
diversion
was
of
a
purely
cosmographic
nature
relating
to
the
date
and
not
to
the
fact
of
the
collision
but
the
least
things
play
an
important
role
in
public
opinion
so
it
was
not
to
be
on
friday
here
he
said
going
to
the
are
the
elements
as
finally
computed
from
all
the
the
speaker
traced
upon
the
the
following
figures
perihelion
passage
august
at
longitude
of
perihelion
perihelion
distance
inclination
longitude
of
ascending
node
the
comet
he
resumed
will
cross
the
ecliptic
in
the
direction
of
the
descending
node
minutes
seconds
after
midnight
of
july
just
as
the
earth
reaches
the
point
of
crossing
the
attraction
of
the
earth
will
advance
the
moment
of
contact
by
only
thirty
seconds
the
event
doubtless
will
be
altogether
exceptional
but
i
do
not
believe
either
that
it
will
be
of
so
tragical
a
nature
as
has
been
depicted
or
that
it
can
really
bring
about
blood
poison
or
universal
asphyxia
it
will
rather
present
the
appearance
of
a
brilliant
display
of
celestial
for
the
arrival
in
the
atmosphere
of
these
solid
and
gaseous
bodies
can
not
occur
without
the
conversion
into
heat
of
the
mechanical
motion
thus
destroyed
a
magnificent
illumination
of
the
sky
will
doubtless
be
the
first
phenomenon
the
heat
evolved
must
necessarily
be
very
great
every
shooting
star
however
small
entering
the
upper
limits
of
our
atmosphere
with
a
cometary
velocity
immediately
becomes
so
hot
that
it
takes
fire
and
is
consumed
you
know
gentlemen
that
the
earth
s
atmosphere
extends
far
into
space
about
our
planet
not
without
limit
as
certain
hypotheses
declare
since
the
earth
turns
on
its
axis
and
moves
about
the
sun
the
mathematical
limit
is
that
height
at
which
the
centrifugal
force
engendered
by
the
diurnal
rotary
motion
becomes
equal
to
the
weight
this
height
is
times
the
equatorial
radius
of
the
earth
the
latter
being
meters
the
maximum
height
of
the
atmosphere
therefore
is
kilometers
i
do
not
here
wish
to
enter
into
a
mathematical
discussion
but
the
audience
before
me
is
too
well
informed
not
to
know
the
mechanical
equivalent
of
heat
every
body
whose
motion
is
arrested
produces
a
quantity
of
heat
expressed
in
caloric
units
by
divided
by
in
which
is
the
mass
of
the
body
in
kilograms
and
its
velocity
in
meters
per
second
for
example
a
body
weighing
kilograms
moving
with
a
velocity
of
one
meter
per
second
would
produce
if
suddenly
stopped
exactly
one
heat
unit
that
is
to
say
the
quantity
of
heat
necessary
to
raise
one
kilogram
of
water
one
degree
in
temperature
if
the
velocity
of
the
body
be
meters
per
second
it
would
produce
times
as
much
heat
or
enough
to
raise
a
quantity
of
water
of
equal
mass
from
to
if
the
velocity
were
meters
per
second
the
heat
developed
would
be
times
as
great
now
you
know
gentlemen
that
the
velocity
with
which
a
comet
may
reach
the
earth
is
meters
per
second
at
this
figure
the
temperature
becomes
five
milliards
of
degrees
this
indeed
is
the
maximum
and
i
should
add
a
number
altogether
inconceivable
but
gentlemen
let
us
take
the
minimum
if
it
be
your
pleasure
and
let
us
admit
that
the
impact
is
not
direct
but
more
or
less
oblique
and
that
the
mean
velocity
is
not
greater
than
meters
per
second
every
kilogram
of
a
bolide
would
develop
in
this
case
heat
units
before
its
velocity
would
be
destroyed
by
the
resistance
of
the
air
in
other
words
it
would
generate
sufficient
heat
to
raise
the
temperature
of
kilograms
of
water
from
to
is
from
the
freezing
to
the
boiling
point
a
uranolite
weighing
kilograms
would
thus
before
reaching
the
earth
develop
enough
heat
to
raise
the
temperature
of
a
column
of
air
whose
is
thirty
square
meters
and
whose
height
is
equal
to
that
of
our
atmosphere
or
to
raise
from
to
a
column
whose
is
square
meters
these
calculations
for
the
introduction
of
which
i
crave
your
pardon
are
necessary
to
show
that
the
immediate
consequence
of
the
collision
will
be
the
production
of
an
enormous
quantity
of
heat
and
therefore
a
considerable
rise
in
the
temperature
of
the
air
this
is
exactly
what
takes
place
on
a
small
scale
in
the
case
of
a
single
meteorite
which
becomes
melted
and
covered
superficially
by
a
thin
layer
of
vitrified
matter
resembling
varnish
but
its
fall
is
so
rapid
that
there
is
not
sufficient
time
for
it
to
become
heated
to
the
center
if
broken
its
interior
is
found
to
be
absolutely
cold
it
is
the
surrounding
air
which
has
been
heated
one
of
the
most
curious
results
of
the
analysis
which
i
have
just
had
the
honor
to
lay
before
you
is
that
the
solid
masses
which
it
is
believed
have
been
seen
by
the
telescope
in
the
nucleus
of
the
comet
will
meet
with
such
resistance
in
traversing
our
atmosphere
that
except
in
rare
instances
they
will
not
reach
the
earth
entire
but
in
small
fragments
there
will
be
a
compression
of
the
air
in
front
of
the
bolide
a
vacuum
behind
it
a
superficial
heating
and
incandescence
of
the
moving
body
a
roar
produced
by
the
air
rushing
into
the
vacuum
the
roll
of
thunder
explosions
the
fall
of
the
denser
metallic
portions
and
the
evaporation
of
the
remainder
a
bolide
of
sulphur
of
phosphorus
of
tin
or
of
zinc
would
be
consumed
and
dissipated
long
before
reaching
the
lower
strata
of
our
atmosphere
as
for
the
shooting
stars
if
as
seems
probable
there
is
a
veritable
cloud
of
them
they
will
only
produce
the
effect
of
a
vast
inverted
display
of
illustration
making
for
the
if
therefore
there
is
any
reason
for
alarm
it
is
not
in
my
opinion
because
we
are
to
apprehend
the
penetration
of
the
gaseous
mass
of
into
our
atmosphere
but
a
rise
in
temperature
which
can
not
fail
to
result
from
the
transformation
of
mechanical
motion
into
heat
if
this
be
so
safety
may
be
perhaps
attained
by
taking
refuge
on
the
side
of
the
globe
opposed
to
that
which
is
to
experience
the
direct
shock
of
the
comet
for
the
air
is
a
very
bad
conductor
of
the
permanent
secretary
of
the
academy
rose
in
his
turn
a
worthy
successor
to
the
fontenelles
and
aragos
of
the
past
he
was
not
only
a
man
of
profound
knowledge
but
also
an
elegant
writer
and
a
persuasive
orator
rising
sometimes
even
to
the
highest
flights
of
eloquence
to
the
theory
which
we
have
just
heard
he
said
i
have
nothing
to
add
i
can
only
apply
it
to
the
case
of
some
comet
already
known
let
us
suppose
for
example
that
a
comet
of
the
dimensions
of
that
of
should
collide
squarely
with
the
earth
in
its
path
about
the
sun
the
terrestrial
ball
would
penetrate
the
nebula
of
the
comet
without
experiencing
any
very
sensible
resistance
admitting
that
this
resistance
is
very
slight
and
that
the
density
of
the
comet
s
nucleus
may
be
neglected
the
passage
of
the
earth
through
the
head
of
a
comet
of
kilometers
in
diameter
would
require
at
least
is
minutes
or
six
hours
round
numbers
seven
velocity
being
times
greater
than
that
of
a
and
the
earth
continuing
to
rotate
upon
its
axis
the
collision
would
commence
about
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
illustration
such
a
plunge
into
the
cometary
ocean
however
rarified
it
might
be
could
not
take
place
without
producing
as
a
first
and
immediate
consequence
by
reason
of
the
thermodynamic
principles
which
have
been
just
called
to
your
attention
a
rise
in
temperature
such
that
probably
our
entire
atmosphere
would
take
fire
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
particular
case
the
danger
would
be
very
serious
but
it
would
be
a
fine
spectacle
for
the
inhabitants
of
mars
and
a
finer
one
still
for
those
of
venus
yes
that
would
indeed
be
a
magnificent
spectacle
analogous
to
those
we
have
ourselves
seen
in
the
heavens
but
far
more
splendid
to
our
near
neighbors
the
oxygen
of
the
air
would
prove
insufficient
to
maintain
the
combustion
but
there
is
another
gas
which
physicists
do
not
often
think
of
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
have
never
found
it
in
their
what
has
become
of
all
the
hydrogen
freed
from
the
soil
these
millions
of
years
which
have
elapsed
since
prehistoric
times
the
density
of
this
gas
being
that
of
the
air
it
must
have
ascended
forming
a
highly
rarified
hydrogen
envelope
above
our
atmosphere
in
virtue
of
the
law
of
diffusion
of
gases
a
large
part
of
this
hydrogen
would
become
mixed
with
the
atmosphere
but
the
upper
air
layers
must
contain
a
considerable
portion
of
it
there
doubtless
at
an
elevation
of
more
than
one
hundred
kilometers
the
shooting
stars
take
fire
and
the
aurora
borealis
is
lighted
notice
here
that
the
oxygen
of
the
air
would
furnish
the
carbon
of
the
comet
ample
material
during
collision
to
feed
the
celestial
fire
thus
the
destruction
of
the
world
will
result
from
the
combustion
of
the
atmosphere
for
about
seven
a
little
longer
as
the
resistance
to
the
comet
can
not
be
will
be
a
continuous
transformation
of
motion
into
a
heat
the
hydrogen
and
the
oxygen
combining
with
the
carbon
of
the
comet
will
take
fire
the
temperature
of
the
air
will
be
raised
several
hundred
degrees
woods
gardens
plants
forests
habitations
edifices
cities
villages
will
all
be
rapidly
consumed
the
sea
the
lakes
and
the
rivers
will
begin
to
boil
men
and
animals
enveloped
in
the
hot
breath
of
the
comet
will
die
asphyxiated
before
they
are
burned
their
gasping
lungs
inhaling
only
flame
every
corpse
will
be
almost
immediately
carbonized
reduced
to
ashes
and
in
this
vast
celestial
furnace
only
the
voice
of
the
trumpet
of
the
indestructible
angel
of
the
apocalypse
will
be
heard
proclaiming
from
the
sky
like
a
funeral
knell
the
antique
solvet
sæculum
in
this
is
what
may
happen
if
a
comet
like
that
of
collides
with
the
at
these
words
the
rose
from
his
seat
and
begged
to
be
heard
the
astronomer
perceiving
him
bowed
with
a
courtly
grace
and
seemed
to
await
the
reply
of
his
eminence
i
do
not
desire
said
the
latter
to
interrupt
the
honorable
speaker
but
if
science
announces
that
the
drama
of
the
end
of
the
world
is
to
be
ushered
in
by
the
destruction
of
the
heavens
by
fire
i
can
not
refrain
from
saying
that
this
has
always
been
the
universal
belief
of
the
church
the
heavens
says
peter
shall
pass
away
with
a
great
noise
and
the
elements
shall
meet
with
fervent
heat
the
earth
also
and
the
works
that
are
therein
shall
be
burned
paul
affirms
also
its
renovation
by
fire
and
we
repeat
daily
at
mass
his
words
eum
qui
venturus
est
judicare
vivos
et
mortuos
et
sæculum
per
science
replied
the
astronomer
has
more
than
once
been
in
accord
with
the
prophecies
of
our
ancestors
fire
will
first
devour
that
portion
of
the
globe
struck
by
the
huge
mass
of
the
comet
consuming
it
before
the
inhabitants
of
the
other
hemisphere
realize
the
extent
of
the
catastrophe
but
the
air
is
a
bad
conductor
of
heat
and
the
latter
will
not
be
immediately
propagated
to
the
opposite
hemisphere
if
our
latitude
were
to
receive
the
first
shock
of
the
comet
reaching
us
we
will
suppose
in
summer
the
tropic
of
cancer
morocco
algeria
tunis
greece
and
egypt
would
be
found
in
the
front
of
the
celestial
onset
while
australia
new
caledonia
and
oceanica
would
be
the
most
favored
but
the
rush
of
air
into
this
european
furnace
would
be
such
that
a
storm
more
violent
than
the
most
frightful
hurricane
and
more
formidable
even
than
the
which
moves
continuously
on
the
equator
of
jupiter
with
a
velocity
of
kilometers
per
hour
would
rage
from
the
antipodes
towards
europe
destroying
everything
in
its
path
the
earth
turning
upon
its
axis
would
bring
successively
into
the
line
of
collision
the
regions
lying
to
the
west
of
the
meridian
first
blasted
an
hour
after
austria
and
germany
it
would
be
the
turn
of
france
then
of
the
atlantic
ocean
then
of
north
america
which
would
enter
somewhat
obliquely
the
dangerous
area
about
five
or
six
hours
after
is
towards
the
end
of
the
collision
notwithstanding
the
velocities
of
the
comet
and
the
earth
the
pressure
can
not
be
enormous
in
view
of
the
extremely
rarified
state
of
the
matter
traversed
by
the
earth
but
this
matter
containing
so
much
carbon
is
combustible
and
at
perihelion
these
bodies
are
not
infrequently
seen
to
shine
by
their
own
as
well
as
by
reflected
light
they
become
incandescent
what
then
must
be
the
result
of
a
collision
with
the
earth
the
combustion
of
meteorites
and
bolides
the
superficial
fusion
of
the
uranolites
which
reach
the
earth
s
surface
on
fire
all
lead
us
to
believe
that
the
moment
of
greatest
heat
will
be
that
of
contact
which
evidently
will
not
prevent
the
massive
elements
forming
the
nucleus
of
the
comet
from
crushing
the
localities
where
they
fall
and
perhaps
even
breaking
up
an
entire
continent
illustration
death
by
the
terrestrial
globe
being
thus
entirely
surrounded
by
the
cometary
mass
for
nearly
seven
hours
and
revolving
in
this
incandescent
gas
the
air
rushing
violently
toward
the
center
of

boiling
and
filling
the
atmosphere
with
new
vapors
hot
showers
falling
from
the
the
storm
raging
everywhere
with
electric
deflagrations
and
lightnings
the
rolling
of
thunder
heard
above
the
scream
of
the
tempest
the
blessed
light
of
former
days
having
been
succeeded
by
the
mournful
and
sickly
gleamings
of
the
glowing
atmosphere
the
whole
earth
will
speedily
resound
with
the
funeral
knell
of
universal
doom
although
the
fate
of
the
dwellers
in
the
antipodes
will
probably
differ
from
that
of
the
rest
of
mankind
instead
of
being
immediately
consumed
they
will
be
stifled
by
the
vapors
by
the
excess
of
oxygen
having
been
rapidly
poisoned
by
the
fire
will
afterwards
reduce
their
corpses
to
ashes
while
the
inhabitants
of
europe
and
africa
will
have
been
burned
alive
the
tendency
of
to
absorb
oxygen
will
doubtless
prove
a
sentence
of
instant
death
for
those
farthest
from
the
initial
point
of
the
catastrophe
i
have
taken
as
an
example
the
comet
of
but
i
hasten
to
add
that
the
present
one
appears
to
be
far
less
is
it
absolutely
sure
cried
a
voice
that
of
an
illustrious
member
of
the
chemical
society
from
one
of
the
boxes
is
it
absolutely
sure
the
comet
is
composed
chiefly
of
have
not
the
nitrogen
lines
also
been
detected
in
its
spectrum
if
it
should
prove
to
be
protoxide
of
nitrogen
the
consequence
of
its
mixture
with
our
atmosphere
might
be
anæsthesia
every
one
would
be
put
to
forever
if
the
suspension
of
the
vital
functions
were
to
last
but
a
little
longer
than
is
the
case
in
our
surgical
operations
it
would
be
the
same
if
the
comet
was
composed
of
chloroform
or
ether
that
would
be
an
end
calm
indeed
it
would
be
less
so
if
the
comet
should
absorb
the
nitrogen
instead
of
the
oxygen
for
this
partial
or
total
absorption
of
nitrogen
would
bring
about
in
a
few
hours
for
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
men
and
women
for
the
young
and
the
change
of
temperament
involving
at
first
nothing
charming
sobriety
then
gayety
followed
by
universal
joy
a
feverish
exultation
finally
delirium
and
madness
terminating
in
all
probability
by
the
sudden
death
of
every
human
being
in
the
apotheosis
of
a
wild
saturnalia
an
frenzy
of
the
senses
would
that
death
be
a
sad
one
the
discussion
remains
open
replied
the
secretary
what
i
have
said
of
the
possible
consequences
of
a
collision
applies
to
the
direct
impact
of
a
comet
like
that
of
the
one
that
threatens
us
is
less
colossal
and
its
impact
will
not
be
direct
but
oblique
in
common
with
the
astronomers
who
have
preceded
me
on
this
floor
i
am
inclined
to
believe
in
this
instance
in
a
mighty
display
of
while
the
orator
was
still
speaking
a
young
girl
belonging
to
the
central
bureau
of
telephones
entered
by
a
small
door
conducted
by
a
domesticated
monkey
and
darting
like
a
flash
to
the
seat
occupied
by
the
president
put
into
his
hands
a
large
square
international
envelope
it
was
immediately
opened
and
proved
to
be
a
despatch
from
the
observatory
of
gaurisankar
it
contained
only
the
following
words
the
inhabitants
of
mars
are
sending
a
photophonic
message
will
be
deciphered
in
a
few
gentlemen
said
the
president
i
see
several
in
the
audience
consulting
their
watches
and
i
agree
with
them
in
thinking
that
it
will
be
physically
impossible
for
us
to
finish
in
a
single
session
this
important
discussion
in
which
eminent
representatives
of
geology
natural
history
and
geonomy
are
yet
to
take
part
moreover
the
despatch
just
read
will
doubtless
introduce
new
problems
it
is
nearly
six
o
clock
i
propose
that
we
adjourn
to
nine
o
clock
this
evening
it
is
probable
that
we
shall
have
received
by
that
time
from
asia
the
translation
of
the
message
from
mars
i
will
also
beg
the
director
of
the
observatory
to
maintain
constant
communication
by
telephone
with
gaurisankar
in
case
the
message
is
not
deciphered
by
nine
o
clock
the
president
of
the
geological
society
of
france
will
open
the
meeting
with
a
statement
of
the
investigations
which
he
has
just
finished
on
the
natural
end
of
the
world
everybody
at
this
moment
is
absorbingly
interested
in
whatever
relates
to
the
question
of
the
end
of
our
world
whether
this
is
dependent
upon
the
mysterious
portent
now
suspended
above
us
or
upon
other
causes
of
whatsoever
nature
subject

chapter
iv
the
multitude
stationed
without
the
doors
of
the
institute
had
made
way
for
those
coming
out
every
one
being
eager
to
learn
the
particulars
of
the
session
already
the
general
result
had
in
some
way
become
known
for
immediately
after
the
speech
of
the
director
of
the
paris
observatory
the
rumor
got
abroad
that
the
collision
with
the
comet
would
not
entail
consequences
so
serious
as
had
been
anticipated
indeed
large
posters
had
just
been
placarded
throughout
paris
announcing
the
reopening
of
the
chicago
stock
exchange
this
was
an
encouraging
and
unlooked
for
indication
of
the
resumption
of
business
and
the
revival
of
hope
this
is
what
had
taken
place
the
financial
magnate
whose
abrupt
exit
will
be
remembered
by
the
reader
of
these
pages
after
rolling
like
a
ball
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
row
of
the
hemicycle
had
rushed
in
an
to
his
office
on
the
boulevard
st
cloud
where
he
had
telegraphed
to
his
partner
in
chicago
that
new
computations
had
just
been
given
out
by
the
institute
of
france
that
the
gravity
of
the
situation
had
been
exaggerated
and
that
the
resumption
of
business
was
imminent
he
urged
therefore
the
opening
of
the
central
american
exchange
at
any
cost
and
the
purchase
of
every
security
offered
whatever
its
nature
when
it
is
five
o
clock
at
paris
it
is
eleven
in
the
morning
at
chicago
the
financier
received
the
despatch
from
his
cousin
while
at
breakfast
he
found
no
difficulty
in
arranging
for
the
reopening
of
the
exchange
and
invested
several
millions
in
securities
the
news
of
the
resumption
of
business
in
chicago
had
been
at
once
made
public
and
although
it
was
too
late
to
repeat
the
same
game
in
paris
it
was
possible
to
prepare
new
plans
for
the
morrow
the
public
had
innocently
believed
in
a
spontaneous
and
genuine
revival
of
business
in
america
and
this
fact
together
with
the
satisfactory
impression
made
by
the
session
of
the
institute
was
sufficient
to
rekindle
the
fires
of
hope
no
less
interest
however
was
manifested
in
the
evening
session
than
in
that
of
the
afternoon
and
but
for
the
exertions
of
an
extra
detachment
of
the
french
guard
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
those
enjoying
special
privileges
to
gain
admission
night
had
come
and
with
it
the
flaming
comet
larger
more
brilliant
and
more
threatening
than
ever
and
if
perhaps
the
assembled
multitude
appeared
somewhat
tranquillized
the
remaining
half
was
still
anxious
and
fearful
the
audience
was
substantially
the
same
every
one
being
eager
to
know
at
first
hand
the
issue
of
this
general
public
discussion
of
the
fate
of
the
planet
conducted
by
accredited
and
eminent
scientists
whether
its
destruction
was
to
be
the
result
of
an
extraordinary
accident
such
as
now
threatened
it
or
of
the
natural
process
of
decay
but
it
was
noticed
that
the
cardinal
archbishop
of
paris
was
absent
for
he
had
been
summoned
suddenly
to
rome
by
the
pope
to
attend
an
œcumenical
council
and
had
left
that
very
evening
by
the
tube
gentlemen
said
the
president
the
translation
of
the
despatch
received
at
the
observatory
of
gaurisankar
from
mars
has
not
arrived
yet
but
we
shall
open
the
session
at
once
in
order
to
hear
the
important
communication
previously
announced
which
the
president
of
the
geological
society
and
the
permanent
secretary
of
the
academy
of
meteorology
have
to
make
to
the
former
of
these
gentlemen

already
at
the
desk
his
remarks
stenographically
reproduced
by
a
young
geologist
of
the
new
school
were
as
follows
the
immense
crowd
gathered
within
these
walls
the
emotion
i
see
depicted
upon
every
face
the
impatience
with
which
you
await
the
discussions
yet
to
take
place
all
gentlemen
would
lead
me
to
refrain
from
laying
before
you
the
opinion
which
i
have
formed
from
my
own
study
of
the
problem
which
now
excites
the
interest
of
the
entire
world
and
to
yield
the
platform
to
those
gifted
with
an
imagination
or
an
audacity
greater
than
mine
for
in
my
judgment
the
end
of
the
world
is
not
at
hand
and
humanity
will
have
to
wait
for
it
several
million
gentlemen
i
said
not
thousands
you
see
that
i
am
at
this
moment
perfectly
calm
and
that
too
without
laying
any
claim
to
the
sang
froid
of
archimedes
who
was
slain
by
a
roman
soldier
at
the
siege
of
syracuse
while
calmly
tracing
geometric
figures
upon
the
sand
archimedes
knew
the
danger
and
forgot
it
i
do
not
believe
in
any
danger
whatever
you
will
not
then
be
surprised
if
i
quietly
submit
to
you
the
theory
of
a
natural
end
of
the
world
by
the
gradual
levelling
of
the
continents
and
their
slow
submergence
beneath
the
invading
waters
but
i
shall
perhaps
do
better
to
postpone
for
a
week
this
explanation
as
i
do
not
for
an
instant
doubt
that
we
may
all
or
nearly
all
reassemble
here
to
confer
together
upon
the
great
epochs
of
the
natural
history
of
the
illustration
the
orator
paused
for
a
moment
the
president
had
risen
my
dear
and
honorable
colleague
he
said
we
are
all
here
to
listen
to
you
happily
the
panic
of
the
last
few
days
is
partially
allayed
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
night
of
july
will
pass
like
its
predecessors
nevertheless
we
are
more
than
ever
interested
in
all
which
has
any
bearing
upon
this
great
problem
and
we
shall
listen
to
no
one
with
greater
pleasure
than
to
the
illustrious
author
of
the
classic
treatise
on
in
that
case
gentlemen
resumed
the
president
of
the
geological
society
of
france
i
shall
explain
to
you
what
in
my
judgment
will
be
the
natural
end
of
the
world
if
as
is
probable
nothing
disturbs
the
present
course
of
events
for
accidents
are
rare
in
the
cosmical
order
nature
does
not
proceed
by
sudden
leaps
and
geologists
do
not
believe
in
such
revolutions
or
cataclysms
for
they
have
learned
that
in
the
natural
world
everything
is
subject
to
a
slow
process
of
evolution
the
geological
agents
now
at
work
are
permanent
ones
the
destruction
of
the
globe
by
some
great
catastrophe
is
a
dramatic
conception
far
more
so
certainly
than
that
of
the
action
of
the
forces
now
in
operation
though
they
threaten
our
planet
with
a
destruction
equally
certain
does
not
the
stability
of
our
continent
seem
permanent
except
through
the
intervention
of
some
new
agency
how
is
it
possible
to
doubt
the
durability
of
this
earth
which
has
supported
so
many
generations
before
our
own
and
whose
monuments
of
the
greatest
antiquity
prove
that
if
they
have
come
down
to
us
in
a
state
of
ruin
it
is
not
because
the
soil
has
refused
to
support
them
but
because
they
have
suffered
from
the
ravages
of
time
and
especially
from
the
hand
of
man
the
oldest
historical
traditions
show
us
rivers
flowing
in
the
same
beds
as
today
mountains
rising
to
the
same
height
and
as
for
the
few
which
have
become
obstructed
the
few
which
have
occurred
here
and
there
their
importance
is
so
slight
relatively
to
the
enormous
extent
of
the
continents
that
it
seems
gratuitous
indeed
to
seek
here
the
omens
of
a
final
catastrophe
such
might
be
the
reasoning
of
one
who
casts
a
superficial
and
indifferent
glance
upon
the
external
world
but
the
conclusions
of
one
accustomed
to
scrutinize
closely
the
apparently
insignificant
changes
taking
place
about
him
would
be
quite
different
at
every
step
however
little
skilled
in
observation
he
will
discover
the
traces
of
a
perpetual
conflict
between
the
external
powers
of
nature
and
all
which
rises
above
the
inflexible
level
of
the
ocean
in
whose
depths
reign
silence
and
repose
here
the
sea
beats
furiously
against
the
shore
which
recedes
slowly
from
century
to
century
elsewhere
mountain
masses
have
fallen
engulfing
in
a
few
moments
entire
villages
and
desolating
smiling
valleys
or
the
tropical
rains
assailing
the
volcanic
cones
have
furrowed
them
with
deep
ravines
and
undermined
their
walls
so
that
at
last
nothing
but
ruins
of
these
giants
remain
illustration
the
sea
at
illustration
stream
more
silent
but
not
less
efficacious
has
been
the
action
of
the
great
rivers
as
the
ganges
and
the
mississippi
whose
waters
are
so
heavily
laden
with
solid
particles
in
suspension
each
of
these
small
particles
which
trouble
the
limpidity
of
their
liquid
carrier
is
a
fragment
torn
from
the
shores
washed
by
these
rivers
slowly
but
surely
their
currents
bear
to
the
great
reservoir
of
the
sea
every
atom
lost
to
the
soil
and
the
bars
which
form
their
deltas
are
as
nothing
compared
with
what
the
sea
receives
and
hides
away
in
its
abysses
how
can
any
reflecting
person
observing
this
action
and
knowing
that
it
has
been
going
on
for
many
centuries
escape
the
conclusion
that
the
rivers
like
the
ocean
are
indeed
preparing
the
final
ruin
of
the
habitable
world
geology
confirms
this
conclusion
in
every
particular
it
shows
us
that
the
surface
of
the
soil
is
being
constantly
altered
over
entire
continents
by
variations
of
temperature
by
alterations
of
drought
and
humidity
of
freezing
and
thawing
as
also
by
the
incessant
action
of
worms
and
of
plants
hence
a
continuous
process
of
dissolution
leading
even
to
the
disintegration
of
the
most
compact
rocks
reducing
them
to
fragments
small
enough
to
yield
at
last
to
the
attraction
of
gravity
especially
when
this
is
aided
by
running
water
thus
they
travel
first
down
the
slopes
and
along
the
torrent
beds
where
their
angles
are
worn
away
and
they
become
little
by
little
transformed
into
gravel
sand
and
ooze
then
in
the
rivers
which
are
still
able
especially
at
to
carry
away
this
broken
up
material
and
to
bear
it
nearer
and
nearer
to
their
outlets
it
is
easy
to
predict
what
must
necessarily
be
the
final
result
of
this
action
gravity
always
acting
will
not
be
satisfied
until
every
particle
subject
to
its
law
has
attained
the
most
stable
position
conceivable
now
such
will
be
the
case
only
when
matter
is
in
the
lowest
position
possible
every
surface
must
therefore
disappear
except
the
surface
of
the
ocean
which
is
the
goal
of
every
agency
of
motion
and
the
material
borne
away
from
the
crumbling
continents
must
in
the
end
be
spread
over
the
bottom
of
the
sea
in
brief
the
final
outcome
will
be
the
complete
levelling
of
the
land
or
more
exactly
the
disappearance
of
every
prominence
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
illustration
at
in
the
first
place
we
readily
see
that
near
the
river
mouths
final
form
of
the
dry
land
will
be
that
of
nearly
horizontal
the
effect
of
the
erosion
produced
by
running
water
will
be
the
formation
on
the
of
a
series
of
sharp
ridges
succeeded
by
almost
absolutely
horizontal
plains
between
which
no
final
difference
in
height
greater
than
fifty
meters
can
exist
but
in
no
case
can
these
sharp
ridges
which
on
this
hypothesis
will
separate
the
basins
continue
long
for
gravity
and
the
action
of
the
wind
filtration
and
change
of
temperature
will
soon
obliterate
them
it
is
thus
legitimate
to
conclude
that
the
end
of
this
erosion
of
the
continents
will
be
reduction
to
an
absolute
a
level
differing
but
little
from
that
at
the
river
the
coadjutor
of
the
archbishop
of
paris
who
occupied
a
seat
in
the
tribune
reserved
for
distinguished
functionaries
rose
and
as
the
orator
ceased
speaking
added
thus
will
be
fulfilled
to
the
letter
the
words
of
holy
writ
for
the
mountains
shall
depart
and
the
hills
be
if
then
resumed
the
geologist
nothing
occurs
to
modify
the
reciprocal
action
of
land
and
water
we
can
not
escape
the
conclusion
that
every
continental
elevation
is
inevitably
destined
to
disappear
how
much
time
will
this
require
the
dry
land
if
spread
out
in
a
layer
of
uniform
thickness
would
constitute
a
plateau
of
about
meters
altitude
above
the
admitting
that
its
total
area
is
square
kilometers
it
follows
that
its
volume
is
about
or
in
round
numbers
cubic
kilometers
such
is
the
large
yet
definite
mass
with
which
the
external
agencies
of
destruction
must
contend
illustration
the
rivers
cease
to
taken
together
the
rivers
of
the
world
may
be
considered
as
emptying
every
year
into
the
sea
cubic
kilometers
of
water
in
other
words
milliards
of
cubic
meters
this
would
give
a
volume
of
solid
matter
carried
yearly
to
the
sea
equal
to
cubic
kilometers
if
we
accept
the
established
ratio
of
parts
of
suspended
material
in
parts
of
water
the
ratio
of
this
amount
to
the
total
volume
of
the
dry
land
is
one
to
if
the
dry
land
were
a
level
plateau
of
meters
altitude
it
would
lose
by
fluid
erosion
alone
a
slice
of
about
of
a
millimeter
in
thickness
or
one
millimeter
every
fourteen
millimeters
per
here
we
have
a
definite
figure
expressing
the
actual
yearly
continental
erosion
showing
that
if
only
this
erosion
were
to
operate
the
entire
mass
of
unsubmerged
land
would
disappear
in
than
but
rain
and
rivers
are
not
the
only
agencies
there
are
other
factors
which
contribute
to
the
gradual
destruction
of
the
dry
land
first
there
is
the
erosion
of
the
sea
it
is
impossible
to
select
a
better
example
of
this
than
the
britannic
isles
for
they
are
exposed
by
their
situation
to
the
onslaught
of
the
atlantic
whose
billows
driven
by
the
prevailing
southwest
wind
meet
with
no
obstacle
to
their
progress
now
the
average
recession
of
the
english
coast
is
certainly
less
than
three
meters
per
century
let
us
apply
this
rate
to
the
of
the
world
and
see
what
will
happen
we
may
proceed
in
two
ways
first
we
may
estimate
the
loss
in
volume
for
the
entire
of
the
world
on
the
basis
of
three
centimeters
per
year
to
do
this
we
should
have
to
know
the
length
of
the
and
the
mean
height
of
the
coast
the
former
is
about
kilometers
as
to
the
present
average
height
of
the
coasts
above
the
sea
meters
would
certainly
be
a
liberal
estimate
hence
a
recession
of
three
centimeters
corresponds
to
an
annual
loss
of
three
cubic
meters
per
running
meter
or
for
the
kilometers
of
cubic
meters
which
is
only
of
a
cubic
kilometer
in
other
words
the
erosion
due
to
the
sea
would
only
amount
to
that
of
the
rivers
it
may
perhaps
be
objected
that
as
the
altitude
actually
increases
from
the
toward
the
interior
the
same
rate
of
recession
would
in
time
involve
a
greater
loss
in
volume
is
this
objection
well
founded
no
for
the
tendency
of
the
rain
and
being
as
we
have
said
to
lower
the
this
action
would
keep
pace
with
that
of
the
sea
again
the
area
of
the
dry
land
being
square
kilometers
a
circle
of
equal
area
would
have
a
radius
of
kilometers
but
the
circumference
of
this
circle
would
be
only
kilometers
that
is
to
say
the
sea
could
exercise
upon
the
circle
but
the
erosive
action
which
it
actually
does
upon
the
indented
outline
of
our
shores
we
may
therefore
admit
that
the
erosive
action
of
the
sea
upon
the
dry
land
is
times
than
it
would
be
upon
an
equivalent
circular
area
certainly
this
estimate
is
a
maximum
for
it
is
logical
to
suppose
that
when
the
narrow
peninsulas
have
been
eaten
away
by
the
sea
the
ratio
of
the
perimeter
to
the
surface
will
decrease
more
and
is
the
action
of
the
sea
will
be
less
effective
in
any
event
since
at
the
rate
of
three
centimeters
per
year
a
radius
of
kilometers
would
disappear
in
years
of
this
interval
or
about
years
would
represent
the
minimum
time
necessary
for
the
destruction
of
the
land
by
the
sea
this
would
correspond
to
an
intensity
of
action
scarcely
more
than
that
of
the
rivers
and
rain
taken
together
these
mechanical
causes
would
therefore
involve
every
year
a
loss
in
volume
of
twelve
cubic
kilometers
which
for
a
total
of
would
bring
about
the
complete
submergence
of
the
dry
land
in
a
little
more
than
illustration
the
but
we
are
far
from
having
exhausted
our
analysis
of
the
phenomena
in
question
water
is
not
only
a
mechanical
agent
it
is
also
a
powerful
dissolvent
far
more
powerful
than
we
might
suppose
because
of
the
large
amount
of
carbonic
acid
which
it
absorbs
either
from
the
atmosphere
or
from
the
decomposed
organic
matter
of
the
soil
all
subterranean
waters
become
charged
with
substances
which
it
has
thus
chemically
abstracted
from
the
minerals
of
the
rocks
through
which
it
percolates
river
water
contains
per
cubic
kilometer
about
tons
of
matter
in
solution
the
rivers
of
the
world
bring
yearly
to
the
sea
nearly
cubic
of
such
matter
the
annual
loss
to
the
dry
land
therefore
from
these
various
causes
is
instead
of
twelve
cubic
kilometers
so
that
the
total
of
would
disappear
not
in
eight
but
in
little
less
than
six
million
this
figure
must
be
still
further
modified
for
we
must
not
forget
that
the
sediment
thus
brought
to
the
sea
and
displacing
a
certain
amount
of
water
will
cause
a
rise
of
the
accelerating
by
just
so
much
the
levelling
process
due
to
the
wearing
away
of
the
continents
it
is
easy
to
estimate
the
effect
of
this
new
factor
indeed
for
a
given
thickness
lost
by
the
plateau
heretofore
assumed
the
must
rise
by
an
amount
corresponding
to
the
volume
of
the
submarine
deposit
which
must
exactly
equal
that
of
the
sediment
brought
down
calculation
shows
that
in
round
numbers
the
loss
in
volume
will
be
cubic
having
accounted
for
an
annual
loss
of
cubic
kilometers
are
we
now
in
a
position
to
conclude
what
time
will
be
necessary
for
the
complete
disappearance
of
the
dry
land
always
supposing
the
indefinite
continuance
of
present
conditions
certainly
gentlemen
for
after
examining
the
objection
which
might
be
made
apropos
of
volcanic
eruptions
we
find
that
the
latter
aid
rather
than
retard
the
disintegrating
process
we
believe
therefore
that
we
may
fearlessly
accept
the
above
estimate
of
cubic
kilometers
as
a
basis
of
calculation
and
as
this
figure
is
contained
times
in
which
represents
the
volume
of
the
continents
we
are
authorized
to
infer
that
under
the
action
of
forces
now
in
provided
no
other
movements
of
the
soil
occur
dry
land
will
totally
disappear
within
a
period
of
about
but
this
disappearance
while
interesting
to
a
geologist
or
a
thinker
is
not
an
event
which
need
cause
the
present
generation
any
anxiety
neither
our
children
nor
our
grandchildren
will
be
in
a
position
to
detect
in
any
sensible
degree
its
progress
if
i
may
be
permitted
therefore
to
close
these
remarks
with
a
somewhat
fanciful
suggestion
i
will
add
that
it
would
be
assuredly
the
acme
of
foresight
to
build
today
a
new
ark
in
which
to
escape
the
consequences
of
this
coming
universal
illustration
the
waters
covering
the
face
of
the
such
was
the
learnedly
developed
thesis
of
the
president
of
the
geological
society
of
france
his
calm
and
moderate
statement
of
the
secular
action
of
natural
forces
opening
up
a
future
of
years
of
life
had
allayed
the
apprehension
excited
by
the
comet
the
audience
had
become
wonderfully
tranquillized
no
sooner
had
the
orator
left
the
platform
and
received
the
congratulations
of
his
colleagues
than
an
animated
conversation
began
on
every
side
a
sort
of
peace
took
possession
of
every
mind
people
talked
of
the
end
of
the
world
as
they
would
of
the
fall
of
a
ministry
or
the
coming
of
the

disinterestedly

fatality
put
off

does
not
really
affect
us
at
all
but
the
permanent
secretary
of
the
academy
of
meteorology
had
just
ascended
the
tribune
and
every
one
gave
him
at
once
the
strictest
attention
ladies

i
am
about
to
lay
before
you
a
theory
diametrically
opposed
to

of

based

and
the
gradual
diminution
of
the
present
water
supply
of
the
earth
some
day
there
will
be
no
more
ocean
no
more
clouds
no
more
rain
no
more
springs
no
more
moisture
and
vegetable
as
well
as
animal
life
will
perish
not
by
drowning
through
lack
of
on
the
earth
s
surface
indeed
the
water
of
the
sea
of
the
rivers
of
the
clouds
and
of
the
springs
is
decreasing
without
going
far
in
search
of
examples
i
would
remind
you
gentlemen
that
in
former
times
at
the
beginning
of
the
quaternary
period
the
site
now
occupied
by
paris
with
its
of
inhabitants
from
mount
to
was
almost
entirely
occupied
by
water
only
the
hill
of
passy
at
montmartre
and
and
the
plateau
of
montrouge
at
the
panthéon
and
villejuif
emerged
above
this
immense
liquid
sheet
the
altitudes
of
these
plateaus
have
not
increased
there
have
been
no
upheavals
it
is
the
water
which
has
diminished
in
volume
it
is
so
in
every
country
of
the
world
and
the
cause
is
easy
to
assign
a
certain
quantity
of
water
very
small
it
is
true
in
proportion
to
the
whole
but
not
negligible
percolates
through
the
soil
either
below
the
sea
bottoms
by
crevices
fissures
and
openings
due
to
submarine
eruptions
or
on
the
dry
land
for
not
all
the
rain
water
falls
upon
impermeable
soil
in
general
that
which
is
not
evaporated
returns
to
the
sea
by
springs
rivulets
streams
and
rivers
but
for
this
there
must
be
a
bed
of
clay
over
which
it
may
follow
the
slopes
wherever
this
impermeable
soil
is
lacking
it
continues
its
descent
by
infiltration
and
saturates
the
rocks
below
this
is
the
water
encountered
in
quarries
this
water
is
lost
to
general
circulation
it
enters
into
chemical
combination
and
constitutes
the
hydrates
if
it
penetrates
far
enough
it
attains
a
temperature
sufficient
for
its
transformation
into
steam
and
such
is
generally
the
origin
of
volcanoes
and
earthquakes
but
within
the
soil
as
in
the
open
air
a
sensible
proportion
of
the
water
in
circulation
becomes
changed
into
hydrates
and
even
into
oxides
there
is
nothing
like
humidity
for
the
rapid
formation
of
rust
thus
recombined
the
elements
of
water
hydrogen
and
oxygen
disappear
as
water
thermal
waters
also
constitute
another
interior
system
of
circulation
they
are
derived
from
the
surface
but
they
do
not
return
there
nor
to
the
sea
the
surface
water
of
the
earth
either
by
entering
into
new
combinations
or
by
penetrating
the
lower
is
diminishing
and
it
will
diminish
more
and
more
as
the
earth
s
heat
is
dissipated
the
which
have
been
dug
within
a
hundred
years
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
principal
cities
of
the
world
and
which
afford
the
heat
necessary
for
domestic
purposes
will
become
exhausted
as
the
internal
temperature
diminishes
the
day
will
come
when
the
earth
will
be
cold
to
its
center
and
that
day
will
be
coincident
with
an
almost
total
disappearance
of
water
illustration
no
more
for
that
matter
gentlemen
this
is
likely
to
be
the
fate
of
several
bodies
in
our
solar
system
our
neighbor
the
moon
whose
volume
and
mass
are
far
inferior
to
those
of
the
earth
has
grown
cold
more
rapidly
and
has
traversed
more
quickly
the
phases
of
its
astral
life
its
ancient
on
which
we
today
recognize
the
indubitable
traces
of
water
action
are
entirely
dry
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
kind
of
evaporation
no
cloud
has
been
discovered
and
the
spectroscope
reveals
no
indication
of
the
presence
of
the
vapor
of
water
on
the
other
hand
the
planet
mars
also
smaller
than
the
earth
has
beyond
a
doubt
reached
a
more
advanced
phase
of
development
and
is
known
not
to
possess
a
single
body
of
water
worthy
of
the
name
of
ocean
but
only
inland
seas
of
medium
extent
and
slight
depth
united
with
each
other
by
canals
that
there
is
less
water
on
mars
than
on
the
earth
is
a
fact
proved
by
observation
clouds
are
far
less
numerous
the
atmosphere
is
much
dryer
evaporation
and
condensation
take
place
with
greater
rapidity
and
the
polar
snows
show
variations
depending
upon
the
season
much
more
extensive
than
those
which
take
place
upon
the
earth
again
the
planet
venus
younger
than
the
earth
is
surrounded
by
an
immense
atmosphere
constantly
filled
with
clouds
as
for
the
large
planet
jupiter
we
can
only
make
out
as
it
were
an
immense
accumulation
of
vapors
thus
the
four
worlds
of
which
we
know
the
most
confirm
each
in
its
own
way
the
theory
of
a
secular
decrease
in
the
amount
of
the
earth
s
water
i
am
very
happy
to
say
in
this
connection
that
the
theory
of
a
general
levelling
process
maintained
by
my
learned
colleague
is
confirmed
by
the
present
condition
of
the
planet
mars
that
eminent
geologist
told
us
a
few
moments
ago
that
owing
to
the
continuous
action
of
rivers
plains
almost
horizontal
would
constitute
the
final
form
of
the
earth
s
surface
that
is
what
has
already
happened
in
the
case
of
mars
the
beaches
near
the
sea
are
so
flat
that
they
are
easily
and
frequently
inundated
as
every
one
knows
from
season
to
season
hundreds
of
thousands
of
square
kilometers
are
alternately
exposed
or
covered
by
a
thin
layer
of
water
this
is
notably
the
case
on
the
western
shores
of
the
kaiser
sea
on
the
moon
this
levelling
process
has
not
taken
place
there
was
not
time
enough
for
it
before
its
consummation
the
air
the
wind
and
the
water
had
vanished
it
is
then
certain
that
while
the
earth
is
destined
to
undergo
a
process
of
levelling
as
my
eminent
colleague
has
so
clearly
explained
it
will
at
the
same
time
gradually
lose
the
water
which
it
now
possesses
to
all
appearances
the
latter
process
is
now
going
on
more
rapidly
than
the
former
as
the
earth
loses
its
internal
heat
and
becomes
cold
crevasses
will
undoubtedly
form
as
in
the
case
of
the
moon
the
complete
extinction
of
terrestrial
heat
will
result
in
contractions
in
the
formation
of
hollow
spaces
below
the
surface
and
the
contents
of
the
ocean
will
flow
into
these
hollows
without
being
changed
into
vapor
and
will
be
either
absorbed
or
combined
with
the
metallic
rocks
in
the
form
of
ferric
hydrates
the
amount
of
water
will
thus
go
on
diminishing
indefinitely
and
finally
totally
disappear
plants
deprived
of
their
essential
constituent
will
become
transformed
but
must
at
last
perish
the
animal
species
will
also
become
modified
but
there
will
always
be
herbivora
and
carnivora
and
the
extinction
of
the
former
will
involve
inevitably
that
of
the
latter
and
at
last
the
human
race
itself
notwithstanding
its
power
of
adaption
will
die
of
hunger
and
of
thirst
on
the
bosom
of
a
world
i
conclude
therefore
gentlemen
that
the
end
of
the
world
will
not
be
brought
about
by
a
new
deluge
but
by
the
loss
of
its
water
without
water
terrestrial
life
is
impossible
water
constitutes
the
chief
constituent
of
every
living
thing
it
is
present
in
the
human
body
in
the
enormous
proportion
of
seventy
per
cent
without
it
neither
plants
nor
animals
can
exist
either
as
a
liquid
or
in
a
state
of
vapor
it
is
the
condition
of
life
its
suppression
would
be
the
of
humanity
and
this
nature
will
serve
upon
us
a
dozen
million
years
hence
i
will
add
that
this
will
take
place
before
the
completion
of
the
erosion
explained
by
the
president
of
the
geological
society
of
france
for
he
himself
was
careful
to
note
that
the
period
of
years
was
dependent
upon
the
hypothesis
that
the
causes
now
in
operation
continued
to
act
as
they
do
today
and
furthermore
he
himself
admits
that
the
manifestations
of
internal
energy
can
not
immediately
cease
upheavals
at
various
points
will
occur
for
a
long
period
and
the
growth
of
the
land
area
from
such
causes
as
the
formation
of
deltas
and
volcanic
and
coral
islands
will
still
go
on
for
some
time
the
period
which
he
indicated
therefore
represents
only
the
such
was
the
address
of
the
permanent
secretary
of
the
academy
of
meteorology
the
audience
had
listened
with
the
deepest
attention
to
both
speakers
and
it
was
evident
from
its
bearing
that
it
was
fully
reassured
concerning
the
fate
of
the
world
it
seemed
even
to
have
altogether
forgotten
the
existence
of
the
comet
the
president
of
the
physical
society
of
france
has
the
at
this
invitation
a
young
woman
elegantly
dressed
in
the
most
perfect
taste
ascended
the
tribune
illustration
the
lady
president
of
the
physical
society
addressing
the
my
two
learned
colleagues
she
began
without
further
preamble
are
both
right
for
on
the
one
hand
it
is
impossible
to
deny
that
meteorological
agents
with
the
assistance
of
gravity
are
working
insensibly
to
level
the
world
whose
crust
is
ever
thickening
and
solidifying
and
on
the
other
hand
the
amount
of
water
on
the
surface
of
our
planet
is
decreasing
from
century
to
century
these
two
facts
may
be
considered
as
scientifically
established
but
gentlemen
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
the
end
of
the
world
will
be
due
to
either
the
submergence
of
the
continents
or
to
an
insufficient
supply
of
water
for
plant
and
animal
this
new
declaration
this
announcement
of
a
third
hypothesis
produced
in
the
audience
an
astonishment
bordering
upon
stupor
nor
do
i
believe
the
graceful
orator
hastened
to
add
that
the
final
catastrophe
can
be
set
down
to
the
comet
for
i
agree
with
my
two
eminent
predecessors
that
worlds
do
not
die
by
accident
but
of
old
age
yes
doubtless
gentlemen
she
continued
the
water
will
grow
less
and
perhaps
in
the
end
totally
disappear
yet
it
is
not
this
lack
of
water
which
in
itself
will
bring
about
the
end
of
things
but
its
climatic
consequences
the
decrease
in
the
amount
of
aqueous
vapor
in
the
atmosphere
will
lead
to
a
general
lowering
of
the
temperature
and
humanity
will
perish
i
need
inform
no
one
here
that
the
atmosphere
we
breathe
is
composed
of
per
cent
of
nitrogen
and
twenty
per
cent
of
oxygen
and
that
of
the
remaining
one
per
cent
about
is
aqueous
vapor
and
three
is
carbonic
acid
the
remainder
being
ozone
or
electrified
oxygen
ammonia
hydrogen
and
a
few
other
gases
in
exceedingly
small
quantities
nitrogen
and
oxygen
then
form
per
cent
of
the
atmosphere
and
the
vapor
of
water
the
remainder
but
gentlemen
from
the
point
of
view
of
vegetable
and
animal
life
this
half
of
one
per
cent
of
aqueous
vapor
is
of
supreme
importance
and
so
far
as
temperature
and
climate
are
concerned
i
do
not
hesitate
to
assert
that
it
is
more
essential
than
all
the
rest
of
the
atmosphere
the
heat
waves
coming
from
the
sun
to
the
earth
which
warm
the
soil
and
are
thence
returned
and
scattered
through
the
atmosphere
into
space
in
their
passage
through
the
air
meet
with
the
oxygen
and
nitrogen
atoms
and
with
the
molecules
of
aqueous
vapor
these
molecules
are
so
thinly
scattered
for
they
occupy
but
the
hundredth
part
of
the
space
occupied
by
the
others
that
one
might
infer
that
the
retention
of
any
heat
whatever
is
due
rather
to
the
nitrogen
and
oxygen
than
to
the
aqueous
vapor
indeed
if
we
consider
the
atoms
alone
we
find
two
hundred
oxygen
and
nitrogen
atoms
for
one
of
aqueous
vapor
well
this
one
atom
has
eighty
times
more
energy
more
effective
power
to
retain
radiant
heat
than
the
two
hundred
others
consequently
a
molecule
of
the
vapor
of
water
is
times
more
effective
than
a
molecule
of
dry
air
in
absorbing
and
in
radiating
these
two
properties
are
reciprocally
proportional
to
diminish
by
any
great
amount
the
number
of
these
invisible
molecules
of
the
vapor
of
water
is
to
immediately
render
the
earth
uninhabitable
notwithstanding
its
oxygen
even
the
equatorial
and
tropical
regions
will
suddenly
lose
their
heat
and
will
be
condemned
to
the
cold
of
mountain
summits
covered
with
perpetual
snow
and
frost
in
place
of
luxurious
plants
of
flowers
and
fruits
of
birds
and
nests
of
the
life
which
swarms
in
the
sea
and
upon
the
land
instead
of
murmuring
brooks
and
limpid
rivers
of
lakes
and
seas
we
shall
be
surrounded
only
by
ice
in
the
midst
of
a
vast
when
i
say
gentlemen
you
understand
we
shall
not
linger
long
as
witnesses
for
the
very
blood
would
freeze
in
our
veins
and
arteries
and
every
human
heart
would
soon
cease
to
beat
such
would
be
the
consequences
of
the
suppression
of
this
half
hundredth
part
of
aqueous
vapor
which
disseminated
through
the
atmosphere
beneficently
protects
and
preserves
all
terrestrial
life
as
in
a
illustration
primary
vegetation
at
the
north
the
principles
of
thermodynamics
prove
that
the
temperature
of
space
is
below
zero
and
this
gentlemen
is
the
more
than
glacial
cold
in
which
our
planet
will
sleep
when
it
shall
have
lost
this
airy
garment
in
whose
sheltering
warmth
it
is
today
enwrapped
such
is
the
fate
with
which
the
gradual
loss
of
the
earth
s
water
threatens
the
world
and
this
death
by
cold
will
be
inevitably
ours
if
our
earthly
sojourn
is
long
enough
this
end
is
all
the
more
certain
because
not
only
the
aqueous
vapor
is
diminishing
but
also
the
oxygen
and
nitrogen
in
brief
the
entire
atmosphere
little
by
little
the
oxygen
becomes
fixed
in
the
various
oxides
which
are
constantly
forming
on
the
earth
s
surface
this
is
the
case
also
with
the
nitrogen
which
disappears
in
the
soil
and
vegetation
never
wholly
regaining
a
gaseous
state
and
the
atmosphere
penetrates
by
its
weight
into
the
land
and
sea
descending
into
subterranean
depths
little
by
little
from
century
to
century
it
grows
less
once
as
for
example
in
the
early
primary
period
it
was
of
vast
extent
the
earth
was
almost
wholly
covered
by
water
only
the
first
granite
upheaval
broke
the
surface
of
the
universal
ocean
and
the
atmosphere
was
saturated
with
a
quantity
of
aqueous
vapor
immeasurably
greater
than
that
it
now
holds
this
is
the
explanation
of
the
high
temperature
of
those
bygone
days
when
the
tropical
plants
of
our
time
the
tree
ferns
such
as
the
calamites
the
equisetaceæ
the
sigillaria
and
the
lepidodendrons
flourished
as
luxuriously
at
the
poles
as
at
the
equator
today
both
the
atmosphere
and
aqueous
vapor
have
considerably
diminished
in
amount
in
the
future
they
are
destined
to
disappear
jupiter
which
is
still
in
its
primary
period
possesses
an
immense
atmosphere
full
of
vapors
the
moon
does
not
appear
to
have
any
at
all
so
that
the
temperature
is
always
below
the
freezing
point
even
in
the
sunlight
and
the
atmosphere
of
mars
is
sensibly
rarer
than
ours
as
to
the
time
which
must
elapse
before
this
reign
of
cold
caused
by
the
diminution
of
the
aqueous
atmosphere
which
surrounds
the
globe
i
also
would
adopt
the
period
of
years
as
estimated
by
the
speaker
who
preceded
me
such
ladies
are
the
stages
of
which
nature
seems
to
have
marked
out
at
least
for
the
planetary
system
to
which
we
belong
i
conclude
therefore
that
the
fate
of
the
earth
will
be
the
same
as
that
of
the
moon
and
that
when
it
loses
the
airy
garment
which
now
guarantees
it
against
the
loss
of
the
heat
received
from
the
sun
it
will
perish
with
at
this
point
the
chancellor
of
the
columbian
academy
who
had
come
that
very
day
from
bogota
by
an
electric
to
participate
in
the
discussion
requested
permission
to
speak
it
was
known
that
he
had
founded
on
the
very
equator
itself
at
an
enormous
altitude
an
observatory
overlooking
the
entire
planet
from
which
one
might
see
both
the
celestial
poles
at
the
same
time
and
which
he
had
named
in
honor
of
a
french
astronomer
who
had
devoted
his
whole
life
to
making
known
his
favorite
science
and
to
establishing
its
great
philosophical
importance
he
was
received
with
marked
sympathy
and
attention
gentlemen
he
said
on
reaching
the
desk
in
these
two
sessions
we
have
had
an
admirable
resumé
of
the
curious
theories
which
modern
science
is
in
a
position
to
offer
us
upon
the
various
ways
in
which
our
world
may
come
to
an
end
the
burning
of
the
atmosphere
or
suffocation
caused
by
the
shock
of
the
rapidly
approaching
comet
the
submergence
of
the
continents
in
the
far
future
beneath
the
sea
the
drying
up
of
the
earth
as
a
result
of
the
gradual
loss
of
its
water
and
finally
the
freezing
of
our
unhappy
planet
grown
old
as
the
decaying
and
frozen
moon
here
if
i
mistake
not
are
five
distinct
possible
ends
illustration
perishing
from
the
director
of
the
observatory
has
announced
that
he
does
not
believe
in
the
first
two
and
that
in
his
opinion
a
collision
with
the
comet
will
have
only
insignificant
results
i
agree
with
him
in
every
respect
and
i
now
wish
to
add
after
listening
attentively
to
the
learned
addresses
of
my
distinguished
colleagues
that
i
do
not
believe
in
the
other
three
either
ladies
continued
the
columbian
astronomer
you
know
as
well
as
we
do
that
nothing
is
eternal
in
the
bosom
of
nature
all
is
change
the
buds
of
the
spring
burst
into
flowers
the
flowers
in
their
turn
become
fruit
the
generations
succeed
each
other
and
life
accomplishes
its
mission
so
the
world
which
we
inhabit
will
have
its
end
as
it
has
had
its
beginning
but
neither
the
comet
nor
water
nor
the
lack
of
water
are
to
cause
its
death
agony
to
my
mind
the
whole
question
hangs
upon
a
single
word
in
the
closing
sentence
of
the
very
remarkable
address
which
has
just
been
made
by
our
gracious
colleague
the
president
of
the
physical
society
the
sun
yes
here
is
the
key
to
the
whole
problem
terrestrial
life
depends
upon
its
rays
i
say
depends
upon
is
a
form
of
solar
energy
it
is
the
sun
which
maintains
water
in
a
liquid
state
and
the
atmosphere
in
a
gaseous
one
without
it
all
would
be
solid
and
lifeless
it
is
the
sun
which
draws
water
from
the
sea
the
lakes
the
rivers
the
moist
soil
which
forms
the
clouds
and
sets
the
air
in
motion
which
produces
rain
and
controls
the
fruitful
circulation
of
the
water
thanks
to
the
solar
light
and
heat
the
plants
assimilate
the
carbon
contained
in
the
carbonic
acid
of
the
atmosphere
and
in
separating
the
oxygen
from
the
carbon
and
appropriating
the
latter
the
plant
performs
a
great
work
to
this
conversion
of
solar
into
vital
energy
as
well
as
to
the
shade
of
the
trees
is
due
the
freshness
of
the
forests
the
wood
which
blazes
on
our
hearthstones
does
but
render
up
to
us
its
store
of
solar
heat
and
when
we
consume
gas
or
coal
today
we
are
only
setting
free
the
rays
imprisoned
millions
of
years
ago
in
the
forests
of
the
primary
age
electricity
itself
is
but
a
form
of
energy
whose
original
source
is
the
sun
it
is
then
the
sun
which
murmurs
in
the
brook
which
whispers
in
the
wind
which
moans
in
the
tempest
which
blossoms
in
the
rose
which
trills
in
the
throat
of
the
nightingale
which
gleams
in
the
lightning
which
thunders
in
the
storm
which
sings
or
wails
in
the
vast
symphony
of
nature
thus
the
solar
heat
is
changed
into
air
or
water
currents
into
the
expansive
force
of
gases
and
vapors
into
electricity
into
woods
flowers
fruits
and
muscular
energy
so
long
as
this
brilliant
star
supplies
us
with
sufficient
heat
the
continuance
of
the
world
and
of
life
is
assured
the
probable
cause
of
the
heat
of
the
sun
is
the
condensation
of
the
nebula
in
which
this
central
body
of
our
system
had
its
origin
this
conversion
of
mechanical
energy
must
have
produced
degrees
centigrade
you
know
gentlemen
that
a
kilogram
of
coal
falling
from
an
infinite
distance
to
the
sun
would
produce
by
its
impact
six
thousand
times
more
heat
than
by
its
combustion
at
the
present
rate
of
radiation
this
supply
of
heat
accounts
for
the
emission
of
thermal
energy
for
a
period
of
years
and
it
is
probable
that
the
sun
has
been
burning
far
longer
for
there
is
nothing
to
prove
that
the
elements
of
the
nebula
were
absolutely
cold
on
the
contrary
they
themselves
were
originally
a
source
of
heat
the
temperature
of
this
great
does
not
seem
to
have
fallen
any
for
its
condensation
is
still
going
on
and
it
may
make
good
the
loss
by
radiation
nevertheless
everything
has
an
end
if
at
some
future
stage
of
condensation
the
sun
s
density
should
equal
that
of
the
earth
this
condensation
would
yield
a
fresh
amount
of
heat
sufficient
to
maintain
for
years
the
same
temperature
which
now
sustains
terrestrial
life
and
this
period
may
be
prolonged
if
we
admit
a
diminution
in
the
rate
of
radiation
a
fall
of
meteorites
or
a
further
condensation
resulting
in
a
density
greater
than
that
of
the
earth
but
however
far
we
put
off
the
end
it
must
come
at
last
the
suns
which
are
extinguished
in
the
heavens
offer
so
many
examples
of
the
fate
reserved
for
our
own
luminary
and
in
certain
years
such
tokens
of
death
are
numerous
but
in
that
long
period
of
seventeen
or
twenty
million
years
or
more
who
can
say
what
the
marvellous
power
of
adaptation
which
physiology
and
paleontology
have
revealed
in
every
variety
of
animal
and
vegetable
life
may
not
do
for
humanity
leading
it
step
by
step
to
a
state
of
physical
and
intellectual
perfection
as
far
above
ours
as
ours
is
above
that
of
the
iguanodon
the
stegosaurus
and
the
compsognathus
who
can
say
that
our
fossil
remains
will
not
appear
to
our
successors
as
monstrous
as
those
of
the
dinosaurus
perhaps
the
stability
of
temperature
of
that
future
time
may
make
it
seem
doubtful
whether
any
really
intelligent
race
could
have
existed
in
an
epoch
subjected
as
ours
is
to
such
erratic
variations
of
temperature
to
the
capricious
changes
of
weather
which
characterize
our
seasons
and
who
knows
if
before
that
time
some
immense
cataclysm
some
general
change
may
not
bury
the
past
in
new
geological
strata
and
inaugurate
new
periods
quinquennial
sexennial
differing
totally
from
the
preceding
ones
one
thing
is
certain
that
the
sun
will
finally
lose
its
heat
it
is
condensing
and
contracting
and
its
fluidity
is
decreasing
the
time
will
come
when
the
circulation
which
now
supplies
the
photosphere
and
makes
the
central
mass
a
reservoir
of
radiant
energy
will
be
obstructed
and
will
slacken
the
radiation
of
heat
and
light
will
then
diminish
and
vegetable
and
animal
life
will
be
more
and
more
restricted
to
the
earth
s
equatorial
regions
when
this
circulation
shall
have
ceased
the
brilliant
photosphere
will
be
replaced
by
a
dark
opaque
crust
which
will
prevent
all
luminous
radiation
the
sun
will
become
a
dark
red
ball
then
a
black
one
and
night
will
be
perpetual
the
moon
which
shines
only
by
reflection
will
no
longer
illumine
the
lonely
nights
our
planet
will
receive
no
light
but
that
of
the
stars
the
solar
heat
having
vanished
the
atmosphere
will
remain
undisturbed
and
an
absolute
calm
unbroken
by
any
breath
of
air
will
reign
if
the
oceans
still
exist
they
will
be
frozen
ones
no
evaporation
will
form
clouds
no
rain
will
fall
no
stream
will
flow
perhaps
as
has
been
observed
in
the
case
of
stars
on
the
eve
of
extinction
some
last
flare
of
the
expiring
torch
some
accidental
development
of
heat
due
to
the
falling
in
of
the
sun
s
crust
will
give
us
back
for
a
while
the
sun
but
this
will
only
be
the
precursor
of
the
end
and
the
earth
a
dark
ball
a
frozen
tomb
will
continue
to
revolve
about
the
black
sun
travelling
through
an
endless
night
and
hurrying
away
with
all
the
solar
system
into
the
abyss
of
space
is
to
the
extinction
of
the
sun
that
the
earth
will
owe
its
death
twenty
perhaps
forty
million
years
the
speaker
ceased
and
was
about
to
leave
the
platform
when
the
director
of
the
academy
of
fine
arts
begged
to
be
heard
gentlemen
he
said
from
his
chair
if
i
have
understood
rightly
the
end
of
the
world
will
in
any
case
result
from
cold
and
only
several
million
years
hence
if
then
a
painter
should
endeavor
to
represent
the
last
day
he
ought
to
shroud
the
earth
in
ice
and
cover
it
with
illustration
a
world
of
not
exactly
replied
the
columbian
chancellor
it
is
not
cold
which
produces
glaciers
is
if
the
sun
did
not
evaporate
the
sea
water
there
would
be
no
clouds
and
but
for
the
sun
there
would
be
no
wind
for
the
formation
of
glaciers
a
sun
is
necessary
to
vaporize
the
water
and
to
transport
it
in
clouds
and
then
to
condense
it
every
kilogram
of
vapor
formed
represents
a
quantity
of
solar
heat
sufficient
to
raise
five
kilograms
of
to
its
fusing
point
by
lessening
the
intensity
of
the
sun
s
action
we
exhaust
the
glacier
supply
so
that
it
is
not
the
snow
nor
the
glaciers
which
will
cover
the
earth
but
the
frozen
remnant
of
the
sea
for
a
long
time
previously
streams
and
rivers
will
have
ceased
to
exist
and
every
atmospheric
current
will
have
disappeared
unless
indeed
before
giving
up
the
ghost
the
sun
shall
have
passed
through
one
of
those
spasms
to
which
we
referred
a
moment
ago
shall
have
released
the
ice
from
sleep
and
have
produced
new
clouds
and
aerial
currents
reawakened
the
springs
the
brooks
and
the
rivers
and
after
this
momentary
but
deceitful
awakening
shall
have
fallen
back
again
into
lethargy
that
day
will
have
no
another
voice
that
of
a
celebrated
electrician
was
heard
from
the
center
of
the
hemicycle
all
these
theories
of
death
by
cold
he
observed
are
plausible
but
the
end
of
the
world
by
fire
this
has
been
referred
to
only
in
connection
with
the
comet
it
may
happen
otherwise
setting
aside
a
possible
sinking
of
the
continents
into
the
central
fire
brought
about
by
an
earthquake
on
a
large
scale
or
some
widespread
dislocation
of
the
earth
s
crust
it
seems
to
me
that
without
any
collision
a
superior
will
might
arrest
our
planet
midway
in
its
course
and
transform
its
motion
into
a
will
interrupted
another
voice
but
positive
science
does
not
admit
the
possibility
of
miracles
in
nor
i
either
replied
the
electrician
when
i
say
will
i
mean
an
ideal
invisible
force
let
me
explain
the
earth
is
flying
through
space
with
a
velocity
of
kilometers
per
hour
or
meters
per
second
if
some
star
active
or
extinct
should
emerge
from
space
so
as
to
form
with
the
sun
a
sort
of
couple
with
our
planet
on
its
axis
acting
upon
it
like
a
in
a
word
for
any
reason
the
earth
should
be
suddenly
arrested
in
its
orbit
its
mechanical
energy
would
be
changed
into
molecular
motion
and
its
temperature
would
be
suddenly
raised
to
such
a
degree
as
to
reduce
it
entirely
to
a
gaseous
gentlemen
said
the
director
of
the
mont
blanc
observatory
from
his
chair
the
earth
might
perish
by
fire
in
still
another
manner
we
have
lately
seen
in
the
sky
a
temporary
star
which
in
a
few
weeks
passed
from
the
sixteenth
to
the
fourth
magnitude
this
distant
sun
had
suddenly
become
times
hotter
and
more
luminous
if
such
a
fate
should
overtake
our
sun
nothing
living
would
be
left
upon
our
planet
it
is
probable
from
the
study
of
the
spectrum
of
the
light
emitted
by
this
burning
star
that
the
cause
of
this
sudden
conflagration
was
the
entrance
of
this
sun
and
its
system
into
some
kind
of
nebula
our
own
sun
is
travelling
with
a
frightful
velocity
in
the
direction
of
the
constellation
of
hercules
and
may
very
well
some
day
encounter
an
obstacle
of
this
to
resume
continued
the
director
of
the
paris
observatory
after
all
we
have
just
now
heard
we
see
that
our
planet
will
be
at
a
loss
to
choose
among
so
many
modes
of
death
i
have
as
little
fear
now
as
before
of
any
danger
from
the
present
comet
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
solely
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
astronomer
this
poor
wandering
earth
is
exposed
to
more
than
one
peril
the
child
born
into
this
world
and
destined
to
reach
the
age
of
maturity
may
be
compared
to
a
person
stationed
at
the
entrance
to
a
narrow
street
one
of
those
picturesque
streets
of
the
sixteenth
century
lined
with
houses
at
whose
every
window
is
a
marksman
armed
with
a
good
weapon
of
the
latest
model
this
person
must
traverse
the
entire
length
of
the
street
without
being
stricken
down
by
the
weapons
levelled
upon
him
at
close
range
every
disease
which
lies
in
wait
and
threatens
us
is
on
hand
dentition
convulsion
croup
meningitis
measles
smallpox
typhoid
fever
pneumonia
enteritis
brain
fever
heart
disease
consumption
diabetes
apoplexy
cholera
influenza
for
we
omit
many
and
our
hearers
will
have
no
difficulty
in
supplementing
this
enumeration
will
our
unhappy
traveller
reach
the
end
of
the
street
safe
and
sound
if
he
does
it
will
only
be
to
die
just
the
same
illustration
like
a
charge
of
shot
upon
a
meadow
thus
our
planet
pursues
its
way
along
its
heavenly
path
with
a
speed
of
more
than
kilometers
per
hour
and
at
the
same
time
the
sun
hurries
it
on
with
all
the
planets
toward
the
constellation
of
hercules
recapitulating
what
has
just
been
said
and
allowing
for
what
may
have
been
omitted
it
may
meet
a
comet
ten
or
twenty
times
larger
than
itself
composed
of
deleterious
gases
which
would
render
the
atmosphere
irrespirable
it
may
encounter
a
swarm
of
uranolites
which
would
have
upon
it
the
effect
of
a
charge
of
shot
upon
a
meadow
lark
it
may
meet
in
its
path
an
invisible
sun
much
larger
than
itself
whose
shock
would
reduce
it
to
vapor
it
may
encounter
a
sun
which
would
consume
it
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
as
a
furnace
would
consume
an
apple
thrown
into
it
it
may
be
caught
in
a
system
of
electric
forces
which
would
act
like
a
brake
upon
its
eleven
motions
and
which
would
either
melt
it
or
set
it
afire
like
a
platinum
wire
in
a
strong
current
it
may
lose
the
oxygen
which
supports
life
it
may
be
blown
up
like
the
crust
over
a
crater
it
may
collapse
in
some
great
earthquake
its
dry
land
may
disappear
in
a
second
deluge
more
universal
than
the
first
it
may
on
the
contrary
lose
all
its
water
an
element
essential
to
its
organic
life
under
the
attraction
of
some
passing
body
it
may
be
detached
from
the
sun
and
carried
away
into
the
cold
of
stellar
space
it
may
part
not
only
with
the
last
vestige
of
its
internal
heat
which
long
since
has
ceased
to
have
any
influence
upon
its
surface
but
also
with
the
protecting
envelope
which
maintains
the
temperature
necessary
to
life
one
of
these
days
when
the
sun
has
grown
dark
and
cold
it
may
be
neither
lighted
nor
warmed
nor
fertilized
on
the
other
hand
it
may
be
suddenly
scorched
by
an
outburst
of
heat
analogous
to
what
has
been
observed
in
temporary
stars
not
to
speak
of
many
other
sources
of
accidents
and
mortal
peril
whose
easy
enumeration
we
leave
to
the
geologists
paleontologists
meteorologists
physicists
chemists
biologists
physicians
botanists
and
even
to
the
veterinary
surgeons
inasmuch
as
the
arrival
of
an
army
of
invisible
microbes
if
they
be
but
deadly
enough
or
a
epidemic
would
suffice
to
destroy
the
human
race
and
the
principal
animal
and
vegetable
species
without
working
the
least
harm
to
the
planet
itself
from
a
strictly
astronomical
point
of
just
as
the
speaker
was
uttering
these
last
words
a
voice
which
seemed
to
come
from
a
distance
fell
as
it
were
from
the
ceiling
overhead
but
a
few
words
of
explanation
may
here
perhaps
be
desirable
as
we
have
said
the
observatories
established
on
the
higher
mountains
of
the
globe
were
connected
by
telephone
with
the
observatory
of
paris
and
the
sender
of
the
message
could
be
heard
at
a
distance
from
the
receiver
without
being
obliged
to
apply
any
apparatus
directly
to
the
ear
the
reader
doubtless
recollects
that
at
the
close
of
the
preceding
session
a
phonogram
from
mt
gaurisankar
stated
that
a
photophonic
message
which
would
be
at
once
deciphered
had
been
received
from
the
inhabitants
of
mars
as
the
translation
of
this
cipher
had
not
arrived
at
the
opening
of
the
evening
session
the
bureau
of
communications
had
connected
the
institute
with
the
observatory
by
suspending
a
telephonoscope
from
the
dome
of
the
amphitheater
the
voice
from
above
said
the
astronomers
of
the
equatorial
city
of
mars
warn
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
that
the
comet
is
moving
directly
toward
the
earth
with
a
velocity
nearly
double
that
of
the
orbital
velocity
of
mars
mechanical
motion
to
be
transformed
into
heat
and
heat
into
electrical
energy
terrible
magnetic
storms
move
away
from
the
voice
ceased
amid
general
silence
and
consternation
there
were
however
a
few
sceptics
left
one
of
whom
editor
of
la
libre
critique
raising
his
monocle
to
his
right
eye
had
risen
from
the
reporters
desk
and
had
exclaimed
in
a
penetrating
voice
i
am
afraid
that
the
venerable
doctors
of
the
institute
are
the
victims
of
a
huge
joke
no
one
can
ever
persuade
me
that
the
inhabitants
of
that
there
are
any
and
they
have
really
sent
us
a
italy
by
name
i
doubt
very
much
if
one
of
them
ever
heard
of
the
commentaries
of
cæsar
or
the
history
of
the
popes
especially
as
the
orator
who
was
launching
into
an
interesting
dithyrambus
was
at
this
point
suddenly
squelched
by
the
turning
off
of
the
electric
lights
with
the
exception
of
the
illuminated
square
in
the
ceiling
the
room
was
plunged
in
darkness
and
the
voice
added
these
six
words
this
is
the
despatch
from
mars
and
thereupon
the
following
symbols
appeared
on
the
plate
of
the
telephonoscope
illustration
as
this
picture
could
only
be
seen
by
holding
the
head
in
a
very
fatiguing
position
the
president
touched
a
bell
and
an
assistant
appeared
who
by
means
of
a
projector
and
mirror
transferred
these
hieroglyphics
to
a
screen
on
the
wall
behind
the
desk
so
that
every
one
could
readily
see
and
analyze
them
at
their
leisure
their
interpretation
was
easy
nothing
indeed
could
be
more
simple
the
figure
representing
the
comet
needed
no
explanation
the
arrow
indicates
the
motion
of
the
comet
towards
a
heavenly
body
which
as
seen
from
mars
presents
phases
and
sparkles
like
a
star
this
means
the
earth
naturally
so
delineated
by
the
martians
for
their
eyes
developed
in
a
medium
less
luminous
than
ours
are
somewhat
more
sensitive
and
distinguish
the
phases
of
the
earth
and
this
the
more
readily
because
their
atmosphere
is
rarer
and
more
transparent
for
us
the
phases
of
venus
are
just
on
the
limit
of
visibility
the
double
globe
represents
mars
looking
at
the
kaiser
sea
the
most
characteristic
feature
of
martian
geography
and
indicates
a
velocity
for
the
comet
double
the
orbital
velocity
or
a
little
less
for
the
line
does
not
quite
reach
the
edge
the
flames
indicate
the
transformation
of
motion
into
heat
the
aurora
borealis
and
the
lightning
which
follow
the
transformation
into
electric
and
magnetic
force
finally
we
recognize
the
boot
of
italy
visible
from
mars
and
the
black
spot
marks
the
locality
threatened
according
to
their
calculation
by
one
of
the
most
dangerous
fragments
of
the
head
of
the
comet
while
the
four
arrows
radiating
in
the
direction
of
the
four
cardinal
points
of
the
compass
seem
to
counsel
removal
from
the
point
menaced
the
photophonic
message
from
the
martians
was
much
longer
and
far
more
complicated
the
astronomers
on
mt
gaurisankar
had
previously
received
several
such
and
had
discovered
that
they
were
sent
from
a
very
important
intellectual
and
scientific
center
situated
in
the
equatorial
zone
not
far
from
meridian
bay
the
last
message
whose
general
meaning
is
given
above
was
the
most
important
the
remainder
of
it
had
not
been
transmitted
as
it
was
obscure
and
it
was
not
certain
that
its
exact
meaning
had
been
made
out
the
president
rang
his
bell
for
order
he
was
about
to
sum
up
what
had
been
said
before
adjourning
the
meeting
gentlemen
he
began
although
it
is
after
midnight
it
will
be
of
interest
before
we
separate
to
summarize
what
has
been
told
us
in
these
two
solemn
sessions
the
last
despatch
from
gaurisankar
may
well
impress
you
it
seems
clear
that
the
inhabitants
of
mars
are
farther
advanced
in
science
than
ourselves
and
this
is
not
surprising
for
they
are
a
far
older
race
and
have
had
centuries
innumerable
in
which
to
achieve
this
progress
moreover
they
may
be
much
more
highly
organized
than
we
are
they
may
possess
better
eyes
instruments
of
greater
perfection
and
intellectual
faculties
of
a
higher
order
we
observe
too
that
their
calculations
while
in
accord
with
ours
as
to
the
collision
are
more
precise
for
they
designate
the
very
point
which
is
to
receive
the
greatest
shock
the
advice
to
flee
from
italy
should
therefore
be
followed
and
i
shall
at
once
telephone
the
pope
who
at
this
very
moment
is
assembling
the
prelates
of
entire
christendom
so
the
comet
will
collide
with
the
earth
and
no
one
can
yet
foresee
the
consequences
but
in
all
probability
the
disturbance
will
be
local
and
the
world
will
not
be
destroyed
the
is
not
likely
to
penetrate
the
respirable
portions
of
the
atmosphere
but
there
will
be
an
enormous
development
of
heat
as
to
the
veritable
end
of
the
world
of
all
the
hypotheses
which
today
permit
us
to
forecast
that
event
the
most
probable
is
the
explained
to
us
by
the
learned
chancellor
of
the
columbian
academy
the
life
of
the
planet
depends
upon
the
sun
so
long
as
the
sun
shines
humanity
is
safe
unless
indeed
the
diminution
of
the
atmosphere
and
aqueous
vapor
should
usher
in
before
that
time
the
reign
of
cold
in
the
former
case
we
have
yet
before
us
twenty
million
years
of
life
in
the
latter
only
ten
let
us
then
await
the
night
of
july
without
despair
i
advise
those
who
can
to
pass
these
fête
days
in
chicago
or
better
still
in
san
francisco
honolulu
or
noumea
the
electric
are
so
numerous
and
well
managed
that
millions
of
travellers
may
make
the
journey

the
last
judgment
from
the
ceiling
of
the
sistine
chapel
chapter
while
the
above
scientific
discussions
were
taking
place
at
paris
meetings
of
a
similar
character
were
being
held
at
london
chicago
petersburg
yokohama
melbourne
new
york
and
in
all
the
principal
cities
of
the
world
in
which
every
effort
was
made
to
throw
light
upon
the
great
problem
which
so
universally
preoccupied
the
attention
of
humanity
at
oxford
a
theological
council
of
the
reformed
church
was
convened
in
which
religious
traditions
and
interpretations
were
discussed
at
great
length
to
recite
or
even
to
summarize
here
the
proceedings
of
all
these
congresses
would
be
an
endless
task
but
we
can
not
omit
reference
to
that
of
the
vatican
as
the
most
important
from
a
religious
point
of
view
just
as
that
of
the
institute
of
paris
was
from
a
scientific
one
the
council
had
been
divided
into
a
certain
number
of
sections
or
committees
and
the
then
often
discussed
question
of
the
end
of
the
world
had
been
referred
to
one
of
these
committees
our
duty
here
is
to
reproduce
as
accurately
as
possible
the
physiognomy
of
the
main
session
devoted
to
the
discussion
of
this
problem
the
patriarch
of
jerusalem
a
man
of
great
piety
and
profound
faith
was
the
first
to
speak
in
latin
venerable
fathers
he
began
i
can
not
do
better
than
to
open
before
you
the
holy
gospel
permit
me
to
quote
he
then
read
the
words
of
the
evangelists
describing
the
last
days
of
the
earth
and
went
on
footnote
matthew
xxiv
and
xvi
mark
xiii
luke
xvii
and
xxi
these
words
are
taken
verbatim
from
the
gospels
and
you
know
that
on
this
point
the
evangelists
are
in
perfect
accord
illustration
the
patriarch
of
jerusalem
addressing
the
you
also
know
most
reverend
fathers
that
the
last
great
day
is
pictured
in
still
more
striking
language
in
the
apocalypse
of
john
but
every
word
of
the
scriptures
is
known
to
you
and
in
the
presence
of
so
learned
an
audience
it
seems
to
me
superfluous
if
not
out
of
place
to
make
further
citations
from
what
is
upon
every
such
was
the
beginning
of
the
address
of
the
patriarch
of
jerusalem
his
remarks
were
divided
under
three
heads
first
the
teachings
of
christ
second
the
traditions
of
the
church
third
the
dogma
of
the
resurrection
of
the
body
and
of
the
last
judgment
taking
first
the
form
of
an
historical
statement
the
address
soon
became
a
sort
of
sermon
of
vast
range
and
when
the
orator
passing
from
paul
to
clement
of
alexandria
tertulian
and
origen
reached
the
council
of
nice
and
the
dogma
of
universal
resurrection
he
was
carried
away
by
his
subject
in
such
a
flight
of
eloquence
as
to
move
the
heart
of
every
prelate
before
him
several
who
had
renounced
the
apostolic
faith
of
the
earlier
centuries
felt
themselves
again
under
its
spell
it
must
be
said
that
the
surroundings
lent
themselves
marvellously
to
the
occasion
the
assembly
took
place
in
the
sistine
chapel
the
immense
and
imposing
painting
of
michael
angelo
like
a
new
apocalyptic
heaven
was
before
every
eye
the
awful
mingling
of
bodies
arms
and
legs
so
forcibly
and
strangely
foreshortened
christ
the
judge
of
the
world
the
damned
borne
struggling
away
by
hideous
devils
the
dead
issuing
from
their
tombs
the
skeletons
returning
to
life
and
reclothing
themselves
with
flesh
the
frightful
terror
of
humanity
trembling
in
the
presence
of
the
wrath
of
seemed
to
give
a
vividness
a
reality
to
the
magnificent
periods
of
the
patriarch
s
oratory
and
at
times
in
certain
effects
of
light
one
might
almost
hear
the
advancing
trumpet
sounding
from
heaven
the
call
of
judgment
and
see
between
earth
and
sky
the
moving
hosts
of
the
resurrection
illustration
scarcely
had
the
patriarch
of
jerusalem
finished
his
speech
when
an
independent
bishop
one
of
the
most
ardent
dissenters
of
the
council
the
learned
mayerstross
rushed
to
the
tribune
and
began
to
insist
that
nothing
in
the
gospel
or
the
traditions
of
the
church
should
be
taken
literally
the
letter
kills
he
cried
the
spirit
vivifies
everything
is
subject
to
the
law
of
progress
and
change
the
world
moves
enlightened
christians
can
not
any
longer
admit
the
resurrection
of
the
body
all
these
images
he
added
were
good
for
the
days
of
the
catacombs
for
a
long
time
no
one
has
believed
in
them
such
ideas
are
opposed
to
science
and
most
reverend
fathers
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
we
must
be
in
accord
with
science
which
has
ceased
to
be
as
in
the
time
of
galileo
the
humble
servant
of
theology
theologiæ
humilis
ancilla
the
body
can
not
be
reconstituted
even
by
a
miracle
so
long
as
its
molecules
return
to
nature
and
are
appropriated
successively
by
so
many
animal
and
vegetable
we
are
formed
of
the
dust
of
the
dead
and
in
the
future
the
molecules
of
oxygen
hydrogen
nitrogen
carbon
phosphorus
sulphur
or
iron
which
make
up
our
flesh
and
our
bones
will
be
incorporated
in
other
human
organisms
this
change
is
perpetual
even
during
life
one
human
being
dies
every
second
that
is
more
than
each
day
more
than
each
year
more
than
three
milliards
each
century
in
a
hundred
a
long
period
in
the
history
of
a
planet
the
number
of
the
resurrected
would
be
three
hundred
milliards
if
the
human
race
lived
but
a
no
one
here
is
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
geological
and
astronomical
periods
are
estimated
by
millions
of
would
be
gathered
before
the
judgment
throne
something
like
three
thousand
milliards
of
men
women
and
children
my
estimate
is
a
modest
one
because
i
take
no
account
of
the
secular
increase
in
population
you
may
reply
to
me
that
only
the
saved
will
rise
what
then
will
become
of
the
others
two
weights
and
two
measures
death
and
life
night
and
day
good
and
evil
divine
injustice
and
reigning
together
over
creation
but
no
you
will
not
accept
such
a
solution
the
eternal
law
is
the
same
for
all
well
what
will
you
do
with
these
thousands
of
milliards
show
me
the
valley
of
jehoshaphat
vast
enough
to
contain
them
will
you
spread
them
over
the
surface
of
the
globe
do
away
with
the
oceans
and
the
icefields
of
the
poles
and
cover
the
world
with
a
forest
of
human
bodies
so
be
it
and
afterwards
what
will
become
of
this
immense
host
no
most
holy
fathers
our
beliefs
must
not
can
not
be
taken
literally
would
that
there
were
here
no
theologians
with
closed
eyes
that
look
only
within
but
astronomers
with
open
eyes
that
look
these
words
had
been
uttered
in
the
midst
of
an
indescribable
tumult
several
times
they
wished
to
silence
the
croatian
bishop
gesticulating
violently
and
denouncing
him
as
schismatic
but
the
rules
did
not
permit
this
for
the
greatest
liberty
was
allowed
in
the
discussion
an
irish
cardinal
called
down
upon
him
the
thunders
of
the
church
and
spoke
of
excommunication
and
anathema
then
a
distinguished
prelate
of
the
gallican
church
no
less
a
person
than
the
archbishop
of
paris
himself
ascended
the
rostrum
and
declared
that
the
dogma
of
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
might
be
discussed
without
incurring
any
canonical
blame
and
that
it
might
be
interpreted
in
entire
harmony
with
reason
and
faith
according
to
him
one
might
admit
the
dogma
and
at
the
same
time
recognize
the
rational
impossibility
of
a
resurrection
of
the
body
the
doctor
angelicus
he
said
speaking
of
thomas
maintained
that
the
complete
dissolution
of
every
human
body
by
fire
would
take
place
before
the
resurrection
summa
theologica
iii
i
readily
concede
with
calmet
on
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
that
to
the
omnipotence
of
the
creator
it
would
not
be
impossible
to
reassemble
the
scattered
molecules
in
such
a
way
that
the
resurrected
body
should
not
contain
a
single
one
which
did
not
belong
to
it
at
some
time
during
its
mortal
life
but
such
a
miracle
is
not
necessary
thomas
has
himself
shown
loco
citato
that
this
complete
material
identity
is
by
no
means
indispensable
to
establish
the
perfect
identity
of
the
resurrected
body
with
the
body
destroyed
by
death
i
also
think
therefore
that
the
letter
should
give
way
to
the
spirit
what
is
the
principle
of
identity
in
a
living
body
assuredly
it
does
not
consist
in
the
complete
and
persistent
identity
of
its
for
in
this
continual
change
and
renewal
which
is
the
very
essence
of
physiological
life
the
elements
which
have
belonged
successively
from
infancy
to
old
age
to
the
same
human
being
would
form
a
colossal
body
in
this
torrent
of
life
the
elements
pass
and
change
ceaselessly
but
the
organism
remains
the
same
notwithstanding
the
modifications
in
its
size
its
form
and
its
constitution
does
the
growing
stem
of
the
oak
hidden
between
its
two
cotyledons
cease
to
be
the
same
plant
when
it
has
become
a
mighty
oak
is
the
embryo
of
the
caterpillar
while
yet
in
the
egg
no
longer
the
same
insect
when
it
becomes
a
caterpillar
and
then
a
chrysalis
and
then
a
butterfly
is
individuality
lost
as
the
child
passes
through
manhood
to
old
age
assuredly
not
but
in
the
case
of
the
oak
the
butterfly
and
the
man
is
there
a
single
remaining
molecule
of
those
which
constituted
the
growing
stem
of
the
oak
the
egg
of
the
caterpillar
or
the
human
embryo
what
then
is
the
principle
which
persists
through
all
these
changes
this
principle
is
a
reality
not
a
fiction
it
is
not
the
soul
for
the
plants
have
life
and
yet
no
souls
in
the
meaning
of
the
word
as
we
use
it
nevertheless
it
must
be
an
imponderable
agent
does
it
survive
the
body
it
is
possible
gregory
of
nyssus
believed
so
if
it
remains
united
to
the
soul
it
may
be
invoked
to
furnish
it
with
a
new
body
identical
with
that
which
death
has
destroyed
even
though
this
body
should
not
possess
single
which
it
possessed
at
any
period
of
its
terrestrial
life
and
this
would
be
as
truly
our
body
as
that
which
we
had
when
five
fifteen
or
thirty
or
sixty
years
of
age
such
a
conception
agrees
perfectly
with
the
expressions
of
holy
writ
according
to
which
it
is
certain
that
after
a
period
of
separation
the
soul
will
again
take
on
the
body
forever
in
addition
to
gregory
of
nyssus
permit
me
most
reverend
fathers
to
cite
a
philosopher
leibnitz
who
held
the
opinion
that
the
physiological
principle
of
life
was
imponderable
but
not
incorporeal
and
that
the
soul
remains
united
to
this
principle
although
separated
from
the
ponderable
and
visible
body
i
do
not
pretend
to
either
accept
or
reject
this
hypothesis
i
only
note
that
it
may
serve
to
explain
the
dogma
of
the
resurrection
in
which
every
christian
should
firmly
this
effort
to
conciliate
reason
and
faith
interrupted
the
croatian
bishop
is
worthy
of
praise
but
it
seems
to
me
more
ingenious
than
probable
are
these
bodies
bodies
like
our
own
if
they
are
perfect
incorruptible
fitted
to
their
new
conditions
they
must
not
possess
any
organ
for
which
there
is
no
use
why
a
mouth
if
they
do
not
eat
why
legs
if
they
do
not
walk
why
arms
if
they
do
not
work
one
of
the
fathers
of
the
early
church
origen
whose
personal
sacrifice
is
not
forgotten
thought
these
bodies
must
be
perfect
spheres
that
would
be
logical
but
not
very
beautiful
or
it
is
better
to
admit
with
gregory
of
nyssus
and
augustin
replied
the
archbishop
that
the
resurrected
body
will
have
the
human
form
a
transparent
veil
of
the
beauty
of
the
thus
was
the
modern
theory
of
the
church
on
the
resurrection
of
the
body
summed
up
by
the
french
cardinal
as
to
the
objections
on
the
score
of
the
locality
of
the
resurrection
the
number
of
the
resurrected
the
insufficiency
of
surface
on
the
globe
the
final
abode
of
the
elect
and
the
damned
it
was
impossible
to
come
to
any
common
understanding
for
the
contradictions
were
irreconcilable
the
resultant
impression
was
however
that
these
matters
also
should
be
understood
figuratively
that
neither
the
heaven
or
the
hell
of
the
theologian
represented
any
definite
place
but
rather
states
of
the
soul
of
happiness
or
of
misery
and
that
life
whatever
its
form
would
be
perpetuated
on
the
countless
worlds
which
people
infinite
space
and
so
it
appeared
that
christian
thought
had
gradually
become
transformed
among
the
enlightened
and
followed
the
progress
of
astronomy
and
the
other
sciences
the
council
had
been
held
on
tuesday
evening
that
is
to
say
on
the
day
following
the
two
meetings
of
the
institute
of
which
an
account
has
been
given
above
the
pope
had
made
public
the
advice
of
the
president
of
the
institute
to
leave
italy
on
the
fatal
day
but
no
attention
had
been
paid
to
it
partly
because
death
is
a
deliverance
for
every
believer
and
partly
because
most
theologians
denied
the
existence
even
of
inhabitants

chapter
vi
it
is
now
time
to
pause
amid
the
eventful
scenes
through
which
we
are
passing
in
order
to
consider
this
new
fear
of
the
end
of
the
world
with
others
which
have
preceded
it
and
to
pass
rapidly
in
review
the
remarkable
history
of
this
idea
which
has
reappeared
again
and
again
in
the
past
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
speaking
this
subject
was
the
sole
theme
of
conversation
in
every
land
and
in
every
tongue
as
to
the
dogma
credo
resurrectionem
carnis
the
addresses
of
the
fathers
of
the
church
before
the
council
assembled
in
the
sistine
chapel
at
rome
were
on
the
whole
in
accord
with
the
opinion
expressed
by
the
cardinal
archbishop
of
paris
the
clause
et
vitam
æternam
was
tacitly
ignored
in
view
of
the
possible
discoveries
of
astronomy
and
psychology
these
addresses
epitomized
as
it
were
the
history
of
the
doctrine
of
the
end
of
the
world
as
held
by
the
christian
church
in
all
ages
this
history
is
interesting
for
it
is
also
the
history
of
the
human
mind
face
to
face
with
its
own
destiny
and
we
believe
it
of
sufficient
importance
to
devote
to
it
a
separate
chapter
for
the
time
being
therefore
we
abandon
our
role
as
the
chronicler
of
the
century
and
return
to
our
own
times
in
order
to
consider
this
doctrine
from
an
historical
point
of
view
the
existence
of
a
profound
and
tenacious
faith
is
as
old
as
the
centuries
and
it
is
a
notable
fact
that
all
religions
irrespective
of
christian
dogma
have
opened
the
same
door
from
this
mortal
life
upon
the
unknown
which
lies
beyond
it
is
the
door
of
the
divine
comedy
of
dante
although
the
conceptions
of
paradise
hell
and
purgatory
peculiar
to
the
christian
church
are
not
universal
zoroaster
and
the
taught
that
the
world
would
perish
by
fire
the
same
idea
is
found
in
the
epistle
of
peter
it
seems
that
the
traditions
of
noah
and
of
deucalion
according
to
which
the
first
great
disaster
to
humanity
came
by
flood
indicated
that
the
second
great
disaster
would
be
of
an
exactly
opposite
character
the
apostles
peter
and
paul
died
probably
in
the
year
during
the
horrible
slaughter
ordered
by
nero
after
the
burning
of
rome
which
had
been
fired
at
his
command
and
whose
destruction
he
attributed
to
the
christians
in
order
that
he
might
have
a
pretext
for
new
persecutions
john
wrote
the
apocalypse
in
the
year
the
reign
of
nero
was
a
bloody
one
and
martyrdom
seemed
to
be
the
natural
consequence
of
a
virtuous
life
prodigies
appeared
on
every
hand
there
were
comets
falling
stars
eclipses
showers
of
blood
monsters
earthquakes
famines
pestilences
and
above
all
there
was
the
jewish
war
and
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
never
perhaps
were
so
many
horrors
so
much
cruelty
and
madness
so
many
catastrophes
crowded
into
so
short
a
period
as
in
the
years
the
little
church
of
christ
was
apparently
dispersed
it
was
impossible
to
remain
in
jerusalem
the
horrors
of
the
reign
of
terror
of
and
of
the
commune
of
were
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
those
of
the
jewish
civil
war
the
family
of
jesus
was
obliged
to
leave
the
holy
city
and
to
seek
safety
in
flight
false
prophets
appeared
thus
verifying
former
prophecies
vesuvius
was
preparing
the
terrible
eruption
of
the
year
and
already
in
pompeii
had
been
destroyed
by
an
earthquake
there
was
every
indication
that
the
end
of
the
world
was
at
hand
nothing
was
wanting
the
apocalypse
announced
it
but
a
calm
followed
the
storm
the
terrible
jewish
war
came
to
an
end
nero
fell
before
galba
under
vespasian
and
titus
peace
succeeded
war
end
of
the
world
was
not
yet
once
more
it
became
necessary
to
interpret
anew
the
words
of
the
evangelists
the
coming
of
christ
was
put
off
until
after
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
and
thus
considerable
margin
was
given
to
the
commentator
a
firm
belief
in
a
final
and
even
an
imminent
catastrophe
persisted
but
it
was
couched
in
vague
terms
which
robbed
the
spirit
as
well
as
the
letter
of
the
prophecy
of
all
precision
still
the
conviction
remained
augustine
devotes
the
xxth
book
of
the
city
of
god
to
the
regeneration
of
the
world
the
resurrection
the
last
judgment
and
the
new
jerusalem
in
the
xxist
book
he
describes
the
everlasting
torments
of
a
witness
to
the
fall
of
rome
and
the
empire
the
bishop
of
carthage
believed
these
events
to
be
the
first
act
of
the
drama
but
the
reign
of
god
was
to
continue
a
thousand
years
before
the
coming
of
satan
gregory
bishop
of
tours
the
first
historian
of
the
franks
began
his
history
as
follows
as
i
am
about
to
relate
the
wars
of
the
kings
with
hostile
nations
i
feel
impelled
to
declare
my
belief
the
terror
with
which
men
await
the
end
of
the
world
decides
me
to
chronicle
the
years
already
passed
that
thus
one
may
know
exactly
how
many
have
elapsed
since
the
beginning
of
the
this
tradition
was
perpetuated
from
year
to
year
and
from
century
to
century
notwithstanding
that
nature
failed
to
confirm
it
every
catastrophe
earthquake
epidemic
famine
and
flood
every
phenomenon
eclipse
comet
storm
sudden
darkness
and
tempest
was
looked
upon
as
the
forerunner
and
herald
of
the
final
cataclysm
trembling
like
leaves
in
the
blast
the
faithful
awaited
the
coming
judgment
and
preachers
successfully
worked
upon
this
dread
apprehension
so
deeply
rooted
in
every
heart
but
as
generation
after
generation
passed
it
became
necessary
to
define
again
the
widespread
tradition
and
about
this
time
the
idea
of
a
millennium
took
form
in
the
minds
of
commentators
there
were
many
sects
which
believed
that
christ
would
reign
with
the
saints
a
thousand
years
before
the
day
of
judgment
irenus
papias
and
sulpicius
severus
shared
this
belief
which
acquired
an
exaggerated
and
sensual
form
in
the
minds
of
many
who
looked
forward
to
a
day
of
general
rejoicing
for
the
elect
and
a
reign
of
pleasure
jerome
and
augustine
did
much
to
discredit
these
views
but
did
not
attack
the
central
doctrine
of
a
resurrection
commentators
on
the
apocalypse
continued
to
flourish
through
the
somber
night
of
the
middle
ages
and
in
the
tenth
century
especially
the
belief
gained
ground
that
the
year
was
to
usher
in
the
great
change
this
conviction
of
an
approaching
end
of
the
world
if
not
universal
was
at
least
very
general
several
charters
of
the
period
began
with
this
sentence
termino
mundi
appropinquante
the
end
of
the
world
drawing
in
spite
of
some
exceptions
it
seems
difficult
not
to
share
the
opinion
of
historians
notably
of
michelet
henry
martin
guizot
and
duruy
regarding
the
prevalence
of
this
belief
throughout
christendom
doubtless
neither
the
french
monk
gerbert
at
that
time
pope
sylvester
nor
king
robert
of
france
regulated
their
lives
by
their
superstition
but
it
had
none
the
less
penetrated
the
conscience
of
the
and
many
a
sermon
was
preached
from
this
text
of
the
apocalypse
illustration
victims
of
the
and
when
the
thousand
years
are
expired
satan
shall
be
loosed
out
of
his
prison
and
shall
go
out
to
deceive
the
nations
which
are
in
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
and
another
book
was
opened
which
is
the
book
of
life
and
the
sea
gave
up
the
dead
which
were
in
it
and
death
and
hell
gave
up
the
dead
which
were
in
them
and
they
were
judged
every
man
according
to
his
works
and
i
saw
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
bernard
a
hermit
of
thuringia
had
taken
these
very
words
of
revelation
as
the
text
of
his
preaching
and
in
about
the
year
he
publicly
announced
that
the
end
of
the
world
was
at
hand
he
even
fixed
the
fatal
day
itself
as
that
on
which
the
annunciation
and
holy
friday
should
fall
on
the
same
day
a
coincidence
which
really
occurred
in
druthmar
a
monk
of
corbie
prophesied
the
end
of
the
world
for
the
of
march
in
the
year
in
many
cities
popular
terror
was
so
great
on
that
day
that
the
people
sought
refuge
in
the
churches
remaining
until
midnight
prostrate
before
the
relics
of
the
saints
in
order
to
await
there
the
last
trump
and
to
die
at
the
foot
of
the
cross

this
epoch

many
gifts
to

goods
were
given

heart

a
general
catastrophe
was
but
the
end
of
the
world
was
not
yet
it
was
to
this
critical
period
that
we
owe
the
construction
of
the
magnificent
cathedrals
which
have
survived
the
ravages
of
time
and
excited
the
wonder
of
centuries
immense
wealth
had
been
lavished
upon
the
clergy
and
their
riches
increased
by
donations
and
inheritance
a
new
era
seemed
to
be
at
hand
after
the
year
continues
raoul
glaber
the
holy
basilicas
throughout
the
world
were
entirely
renovated
especially
in
italy
and
gaul
although
for
the
most
part
they
were
in
no
need
of
repair
christian
nations
vied
with
each
other
in
the
erection
of
magnificent
churches
it
seemed
as
if
the
entire
world
animated
by
a
common
impulse
shook
off
the
rags
of
the
past
to
put
on
a
new
garment
and
the
faithful
were
not
content
to
rebuild
nearly
all
the
episcopal
churches
but
also
embellished
the
monasteries
dedicated
to
the
various
saints
and
even
the
chapels
in
the
smaller
the
somber
year
had
followed
the
vanished
centuries
into
the
past
but
through
what
troubled
times
the
church
had
passed
the
popes
were
the
puppets
of
the
rival
saxon
emperors
and
the
princes
of
latium
all
christendom
was
in
arms
the
crisis
had
passed
but
the
problem
of
the
end
of
the
world
remained
and
credence
in
this
dread
event
though
uncertain
and
vague
fostered
by
that
profound
belief
in
the
devil
and
in
prodigies
which
was
yet
to
endure
for
centuries
in
the
popular
mind
the
final
scene
of
the
last
judgment
was
sculptured
over
the
portals
of
every
cathedral
and
on
entering
the
sanctuary
of
the
church
one
passed
under
the
balance
of
the
archangel
on
whose
left
writhed
the
bodies
of
the
devils
and
the
damned
delivered
over
to
the
eternal
flames
of
hell
illustration
but
the
idea
that
the
world
was
to
end
was
not
confined
to
the
church
in
the
twelfth
century
astrologers
terrified
europe
by
the
announcement
of
a
conjunction
of
all
the
planets
in
the
constellation
of
the
scales
this
conjunction
indeed
occurred
for
on
september
all
the
planets
were
found
between
the
and
degrees
of
longitude
but
the
end
of
the
world
did
not
come
the
celebrated
alchemist
arnauld
de
villeneuve
foretold
it
again
for
the
year
in
under
charles
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
occurring
on
june
produced
a
general
panic
which
is
chronicled
by
juvénal
of
the
ursuline
order
it
is
a
pitiable
sight
he
says
to
see
people
taking
refuge
in
the
churches
as
if
the
world
were
about
to
in
vincent
ferrier
wrote
a
treatise
entitled
de
la
fin
du
monde
et
de
la
science
he
allows
christendom
as
many
years
of
life
as
there
are
verses
in
the
psalter
namely
then
a
german
astrologer
one
stoffler
predicted
that
on
february
a
general
deluge
would
result
from
a
conjunction
of
the
planets
he
was
very
generally
believed
and
the
panic
was
extreme
property
situated
in
valleys
along
river
banks
or
near
the
sea
was
sold
to
the
less
credulous
for
a
mere
nothing
a
certain
doctor
auriol
of
toulouse
had
an
ark
built
for
himself
his
family
and
his
friends
and
bodin
asserts
that
he
was
not
the
only
one
who
took
this
precaution
illustration
there
were
few
sceptics
the
grand
chancellor
of
charles
sought
the
advice
of
pierre
martyr
who
told
him
that
the
event
would
not
be
as
fatal
as
was
feared
but
that
the
conjunction
of
the
planets
would
doubtless
occasion
grave
disasters
the
fatal
day
arrived
and
never
had
the
month
of
february
been
so
dry
but
this
did
not
prevent
new
predictions
for
the
year
by
the
astrologer
of
the
elector
of
brandenburg
jean
carion
and
again
for
the
year
by
the
astrologer
cyprian
lëowitz
it
was
again
a
question
of
a
deluge
due
to
planetary
conjunctions
the
terror
of
the
populace
writes
a
contemporary
louis
guyon
was
extreme
and
the
churches
could
not
hold
the
multitudes
which
fled
to
them
for
refuge
many
made
their
wills
without
stopping
to
think
that
this
availed
little
if
the
world
was
really
to
perish
others
donated
their
goods
to
the
clergy
in
the
hope
that
their
prayers
would
put
off
the
day
of
in
there
was
another
astrological
prediction
couched
in
apocalyptic
language
as
follows
the
eighth
year
following
the
fifteen
hundred
and
eightieth
anniversary
of
the
birth
of
christ
will
be
a
year
of
prodigies
and
terror
if
in
this
terrible
year
the
globe
be
not
dissolved
in
dust
and
the
land
and
the
sea
be
not
destroyed
every
kingdom
will
be
overthrown
and
humanity
will
travail
in
illustration
as
might
be
expected
the
celebrated
soothsayer
nostradamus
is
found
among
these
prophets
of
evil
in
his
book
of
rhymed
prophecies
entitled
centuries
we
find
the
following
quatrain
which
excited
much
speculation
quand
georges
dieu
crucifiera
que
marc
le
ressuscitera
et
que
jean
le
portera
la
fin
du
monde
arrivera
the
meaning
of
which
is
that
when
easter
falls
on
the
of
april
mark
s
day
holy
friday
will
fall
on
the
george
s
day
and
corpus
christi
on
the
of
june
john
s
day
and
the
end
of
the
world
will
come
this
verse
was
not
without
malice
for
at
this
time
nostradamus
died
in
the
calendar
had
not
been
reformed
this
was
not
done
until
and
it
was
impossible
for
easter
to
fall
on
the
of
april
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
of
april
corresponded
to
the
fifteenth
the
day
following
november
was
called
the
fifteenth
after
the
introduction
of
the
gregorian
calendar
easter
might
fall
on
the
of
april
its
latest
possible
date
and
this
was
the
case
in
as
it
will
be
again
in
the
end
of
the
world
however
not
being
a
necessary
consequence
of
this
coincidence
illustration
planetary
conjunctions
eclipses
and
comets
were
alike
the
basis
for
prophecies
of
evil
among
the
comets
recorded
in
history
we
may
mention
as
the
most
remarkable
from
this
point
of
view
that
of
william
the
conqueror
which
appeared
in
and
which
is
pictured
on
the
tapestry
of
queen
matilda
at
bayeux
that
of
which
it
is
said
disappeared
the
very
day
of
the
death
of
pope
urban
iv
that
of
one
of
the
largest
and
most
imposing
ever
seen
which
presaged
the
death
of
frederick
king
of
sicily
that
of
which
juvénal
the
ursuline
described
as
the
harbinger
of
coming
evil
that
of
to
which
was
ascribed
the
death
of
gian
galeazzo
visconti
duke
of
milan
that
of
which
filled
all
christendom
with
terror
under
pope
calixtus
during
the
war
with
the
turks
and
which
is
associated
with
the
history
of
the
angelus
and
that
of
which
preceded
the
death
of
the
brother
of
louis
xi
there
were
others
also
associated
like
the
preceding
with
catastrophes
and
wars
and
especially
with
the
dreaded
last
hours
of
the
race
that
of
is
described
by
ambroise
paré
and
by
simon
goulart
as
formed
of
severed
heads
poignards
and
bloody
clouds
the
comet
of
was
thought
to
herald
the
death
of
louise
of
savoy
mother
of
francis
and
this
princess
shared
the
popular
superstition
in
reference
to
evil
stars
behold
she
exclaimed
from
her
bed
on
perceiving
the
comet
through
the
window
behold
an
omen
which
is
not
given
to
one
of
low
degree
god
sends
it
as
a
warning
to
us
let
us
prepare
to
meet
three
days
after
she
died
but
the
famous
comet
of
charles
appearing
in
was
perhaps
the
most
memorable
of
all
it
had
been
identified
as
the
comet
of
and
its
return
was
announced
for
but
it
did
not
reappear
the
comets
of
and
were
the
subjects
of
endless
commentaries
forming
a
library
by
themselves
at
the
last
of
these
alphonso
king
of
portugal
angrily
discharged
his
pistol
with
the
most
grotesque
defiance
pierre
petit
by
order
of
louis
published
a
work
designed
to
counteract
the
foolish
and
political
apprehensions
excited
by
comets
this
illustrious
king
desired
to
be
without
a
rival
the
only
sun
nec
pluribus
impar
and
would
not
admit
the
supposition
that
the
glory
of
france
could
be
imperilled
even
by
a
celestial
phenomenon
one
of
the
greatest
comets
which
ever
struck
the
imagination
of
men
was
assuredly
the
famous
comet
of
to
which
newton
devoted
so
much
attention
it
issued
said
lemonnier
with
a
frightful
velocity
from
the
depths
of
space
and
seemed
falling
directly
into
the
sun
and
was
seen
to
vanish
with
an
equal
velocity
it
was
visible
for
four
months
it
approached
quite
near
to
the
earth
and
whiston
ascribed
the
deluge
to
its
former
bayle
wrote
a
treatise
to
prove
the
absurdity
of
beliefs
founded
on
these
portents
madame
de
sévigné
writing
to
her
cousin
count
de
says
we
have
a
comet
of
enormous
size
its
tail
is
the
most
beautiful
object
conceivable
every
person
of
note
is
alarmed
and
believes
that
heaven
interested
in
their
fate
sends
them
a
warning
in
this
comet
they
say
that
the
courtiers
of
cardinal
mazarin
who
is
despaired
of
by
his
physicians
believe
this
prodigy
is
in
honor
of
his
passing
away
and
tell
him
of
the
terror
with
which
it
has
inspired
them
he
had
the
sense
to
laugh
at
them
and
to
reply
facetiously
that
the
comet
did
him
too
much
honor
in
truth
we
ought
all
to
agree
with
him
for
human
pride
assumes
too
much
when
it
believes
that
death
is
attended
by
such
signs
from
we
see
that
comets
were
gradually
losing
their
prestige
yet
we
read
in
a
treatise
of
the
astronomer
bernouilli
this
singular
remark
if
the
head
of
the
comet
be
not
a
visible
sign
of
the
anger
of
god
tail
may
well
fear
of
the
end
of
the
world
was
reawakened
by
the
appearance
of
comets
in
a
great
panic
spread
throughout
europe
and
paris
itself
was
alarmed
here
is
an
extract
from
the
memoirs
of
bachaumont
accessible
to
every
reader
may
in
the
last
public
meeting
of
the
academy
of
sciences
de
lalande
was
to
read
by
far
the
most
interesting
paper
of
all
this
however
he
was
not
able
to
do
for
lack
of
time
it
concerned
the
comets
which
by
approaching
the
earth
may
cause
revolutions
and
dealt
especially
with
that
one
whose
return
is
expected
in
eighteen
years
but
although
he
affirmed
that
it
was
not
one
of
those
which
would
harm
the
earth
and
that
moreover
he
had
observed
that
one
could
not
fix
with
any
exactness
the
order
of
such
occurrences
there
exists
nevertheless
a
very
general
anxiety
may
the
cabinet
of
de
lalande
is
filled
with
the
curious
who
come
to
question
him
concerning
the
above
memoir
and
in
order
to
reassure
those
who
have
been
alarmed
by
the
exaggerated
rumors
circulated
about
it
he
will
doubtless
be
forced
to
make
it
public
the
excitement
has
been
so
great
that
some
ignorant
fanatics
have
besought
the
archbishop
to
institute
prayers
for
forty
hours
in
order
to
avert
the
deluge
which
menaces
us
and
this
prelate
would
have
authorized
these
prayers
had
not
the
academy
shown
him
the
ridicule
which
such
a
step
would
produce
may
the
memoir
of
de
lalande
has
appeared
he
says
that
it
is
his
opinion
that
of
the
sixty
known
comets
eight
by
their
near
approach
to
the
earth
might
produce
a
pressure
such
that
the
sea
would
leave
its
bed
and
cover
a
part
of
the
in
time
the
excitement
died
away
the
fear
of
comets
assumed
a
new
form
they
were
no
longer
regarded
as
indications
of
the
anger
of
god
but
their
collision
with
the
earth
was
discussed
from
a
scientific
point
of
view
and
these
collisions
were
not
considered
free
of
danger
at
the
close
of
the
last
century
laplace
stated
his
views
on
this
question
in
the
forcible
language
which
we
have
quoted
in
chapter
ii
in
this
century
predictions
concerning
the
end
of
the
world
have
several
times
been
associated
with
the
appearance
of
comets
it
was
announced
that
the
comet
of
biela
for
example
would
intersect
the
earth
s
orbit
on
october
which
it
did
as
predicted
there
was
great
excitement
once
more
the
end
of
things
was
declared
at
hand
humanity
was
threatened
what
was
going
to
happen
the
orbit
that
is
to
say
the
path
of
the
earth
had
been
confounded
with
the
earth
itself
the
latter
was
not
to
reach
that
point
of
its
orbit
traversed
by
the
comet
until
november
more
than
a
month
after
the
comet
s
passage
and
the
latter
was
at
no
time
to
be
within
leagues
of
us
once
more
we
got
off
with
a
fright
it
was
the
same
in
some
prophet
of
ill
omen
had
declared
that
the
famous
comet
of
charles
whose
periodic
time
was
thought
to
be
three
centuries
would
return
on
the
of
june
of
that
year
more
than
one
timid
soul
was
rendered
anxious
and
the
confessionals
of
paris
were
more
than
usually
crowded
with
penitents
another
prediction
was
made
public
in
in
the
name
of
an
astronomer
who
however
was
not
responsible
for
plantamour
director
of
the
geneva
observatory
as
in
the
case
of
comets
so
with
other
unusual
phenomena
such
as
total
solar
eclipses
mysterious
suns
appearing
suddenly
in
the
skies
showers
of
shooting
stars
great
volcanic
eruptions
accompanied
with
the
darkness
of
night
and
seeming
to
threaten
the
burial
of
the
world
in
ashes
earthquakes
overthrowing
and
engulfing
houses
and
these
grand
and
terrible
events
have
been
connected
with
the
fear
of
an
immediate
and
universal
end
of
men
and
things
the
history
of
eclipses
alone
would
suffice
to
fill
a
volume
no
less
interesting
than
the
history
of
comets
confining
our
attention
to
a
modern
example
one
of
the
last
total
eclipses
of
the
sun
visible
in
france
that
of
august
had
been
foretold
by
astronomers
and
its
announcement
had
produced
great
alarm
for
some
it
meant
the
overthrow
of
states
and
the
fall
of
rome
for
others
it
signified
a
new
deluge
there
were
those
who
believed
that
nothing
less
than
the
destruction
of
the
world
by
fire
was
inevitable
while
the
more
collected
anticipated
the
poisoning
of
the
atmosphere
belief
in
these
dreaded
results
were
so
widespread
that
in
order
to
escape
them
and
by
the
express
order
of
physicians
many
terrified
people
shut
themselves
up
in
closed
cellars
warmed
and
perfumed
we
refer
the
reader
especially
to
the
second
evening
of
les
mondes
of
fontenelle
another
writer
of
the
same
century
petit
to
whom
we
referred
a
moment
ago
in
his
dissertation
on
the
nature
of
comets
says
that
the
consternation
steadily
increased
up
to
the
fatal
day
and
that
a
country
curate
unable
to
confess
all
who
believed
their
last
hour
was
at
hand
at
sermon
time
told
his
parishioners
not
to
be
in
such
haste
for
the
eclipse
had
been
put
off
for
a
fortnight
and
these
good
people
were
as
ready
to
believe
in
the
postponement
of
the
eclipse
as
they
had
been
in
its
malign
influence
illustration
people
seeking
refuge
in
closed
at
the
time
of
the
last
total
solar
eclipses
visible
in
france
namely
those
of
may
may
and
july
as
also
of
the
partial
ones
of
october
july
march
july
and
december
there
was
more
or
less
apprehension
on
the
part
of
the
timid
at
least
we
know
from
trustworthy
sources
that
in
each
of
these
cases
these
natural
phenomena
were
interpreted
by
a
certain
class
in
europe
as
possible
signs
of
divine
wrath
and
in
several
religious
educational
establishments
the
pupils
were
requested
to
offer
up
prayers
as
the
time
of
the
eclipse
drew
near
this
mystical
interpretation
of
the
order
of
nature
is
slowly
disappearing
among
enlightened
nations
and
the
next
total
eclipse
of
the
sun
visible
in
southern
france
on
may
will
probably
inspire
no
fear
on
the
french
side
of
the
pyrenees
but
it
might
be
premature
to
make
the
same
statement
regarding
those
who
will
observe
it
from
the
spanish
side
of
the
mountains
among
uncivilized
people
these
phenomena
excite
today
the
same
terror
which
they
once
did
among

this
fact
is
frequently
attested
by
travellers
especially
in
africa
during
the
eclipse
of
july
in
algeria
men
and
women
resorted
to
prayer
or
fled
affrighted
to
their
homes
during
the
eclipse
of
july
which
was
total
in
the
united
states
a
negro
suddenly
crazed
with
terror
and
persuaded
that
the
end
of
the
world
was
coming
cut
the
throats
of
his
wife
and
children
it
must
be
admitted
that
such
phenomena
are
well
calculated
to
overwhelm
the
imagination
the
sun
the
god
of
day
the
star
upon
whose
light
we
are
dependent
grows
dim
and
just
before
it
becomes
extinguished
takes
on
a
sickly
and
mournful
hue
the
light
of
the
sky
pales
the
animal
creation
is
stricken
with
terror
the
beast
of
burden
falters
at
his
task
the
dog
flees
to
its
master
the
hen
retreats
with
her
brood
to
the
coop
the
birds
cease
their
songs
and
have
been
seen
even
to
drop
dead
with
fright
arago
relates
that
during
the
total
eclipse
of
the
sun
at
perpignan
on
july
twenty
thousand
spectators
were
assembled
forming
an
impressive
spectacle
when
the
solar
disc
was
nearly
obscured
an
irresistible
anxiety
took
possession
of
everybody
each
felt
the
need
of
sharing
his
impressions
with
his
neighbor
a
deep
murmur
arose
like
that
of
the
far
away
sea
after
a
storm
this
murmur
deepened
as
the
crescent
of
light
grew
less
and
when
it
had
disappeared
and
sudden
darkness
had
supervened
the
silence
which
ensued
marked
this
phase
of
the
eclipse
as
accurately
as
the
pendulum
of
our
astronomical
clock
the
magnificence
of
the
spectacle
triumphed
over
the
petulance
of
youth
over
the
frivolity
which
some
people
mistake
for
a
sign
of
superiority
over
the
indifference
which
the
soldier
frequently
assumes
a
profound
silence
reigned
also
in
the
sky
the
birds
had
ceased
their
songs
after
a
solemn
interval
of
about
two
minutes
joyous
transports
and
frantic
applause
greeted
with
the
same
spontaneity
the
first
reappearance
of
the
solar
rays
and
the
melancholy
and
indefinable
sense
of
depression
gave
way
to
a
deep
and
unfeigned
exultation
which
no
one
sought
to
moderate
or
every
one
who
witnessed
this
phenomenon
one
of
the
most
sublime
which
nature
offers
was
profoundly
moved
and
took
away
with
him
an
impression
never
to
be
forgotten
the
peasants
especially
were
terrified
by
the
darkness
as
they
believed
that
they
were
losing
their
sight
a
poor
child
tending
his
flock
completely
ignorant
of
what
was
coming
saw
the
sun
slowly
growing
dim
in
a
cloudless
sky
when
its
light
had
entirely
disappeared
the
poor
child
completely
carried
away
by
terror
began
to
cry
and
call
for
help
his
tears
flowed
again
when
the
first
ray
of
light
reappeared
reassured
he
clasped
his
hands
crying
o
beautiful
sun
is
not
the
cry
of
this
child
the
cry
of
humanity
so
long
as
eclipses
were
not
known
to
be
the
natural
consequences
of
the
motion
of
the
moon
about
the
earth
and
before
it
was
understood
that
their
occurrence
could
be
predicted
with
the
utmost
precision
it
was
natural
that
they
should
have
produced
a
deep
impression
and
been
associated
with
the
idea
of
the
end
of
the
world
the
same
is
true
of
other
celestial
phenomena
and
notably
of
the
sudden
appearance
of
unknown
suns
an
event
much
rarer
than
an
eclipse
illustration
o
beautiful
sun
the
most
celebrated
of
these
appearances
was
that
of
on
the
of
november
of
that
year
about
a
month
after
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
a
brilliant
star
of
the
first
magnitude
suddenly
appeared
in
the
constellation
of
cassiopeia
the
stupefaction
was
general
not
only
on
the
part
of
the
public
to
which
it
was
visible
every
night
in
the
sky
but
also
on
the
part
of
scientists
who
could
not
explain
its
appearance
astrologers
found
a
solution
of
the
enigma
in
the
assertion
that
it
was
the
star
of
the
magi
whose
reappearance
announced
the
return
of
the
son
of
god
the
last
judgment
and
the
resurrection
this
statement
made
a
deep
impression
upon
all
classes
of
society
the
star
gradually
diminished
in
splendor
and
at
the
end
of
about
eighteen
months
went
out
without
having
caused
any
other
disaster
than
that
which
human
folly
itself
adds
to
the
misery
of
a
none
too
prosperous
planet
science
records
several
apparitions
of
this
nature
but
the
above
was
the
most
remarkable
a
like
agitation
has
accompanied
all
the
grand
phenomena
of
nature
especially
those
which
have
been
unforeseen
in
the
chronicles
of
the
middle
ages
and
even
in
more
recent
memoirs
we
read
of
the
terror
which
the
aurora
borealis
showers
of
shooting
stars
and
the
fall
of
meteorites
have
produced
among
the
alarmed
spectators
recently
during
the
meteor
shower
of
november
when
the
sky
was
filled
with
more
than
forty
thousand
meteorites
belonging
to
the
dispersed
comet
of
biela
women
of
the
lower
classes
at
nice
especially
as
also
at
rome
in
their
excitement
sought
information
of
those
whom
they
thought
able
to
explain
the
cause
of
these
celestial
which
they
had
at
once
associated
with
the
end
of
the
world
and
with
the
fall
of
the
stars
which
it
was
foretold
would
usher
in
that
last
great
event
earthquakes
and
volcanic
eruptions
have
sometimes
attained
such
proportions
as
to
lead
to
the
fear
that
the
end
of
the
world
was
at
hand
imagine
the
state
of
mind
of
the
inhabitants
of
herculaneum
and
of
pompeii
when
the
eruption
of
vesuvius
buried
them
in
showers
of
ashes
was
not
this
for
them
the
end
of
the
world
and
more
recently
were
not
those
who
witnessed
the
eruption
of
krakatoa
of
the
same
opinion
impenetrable
darkness
lasting
eighteen
hours
an
atmosphere
like
a
furnace
filling
the
eyes
nose
and
ears
with
ashes
the
deep
and
incessant
cannonade
of
the
volcano
the
falling
of
pumice

from
the
black
sky
the
terrible
scene
illuminated
only
at
intervals
by
the
lurid
lightning
or
the
on
the
spars

rigging
of

thunder
echoing
from
cloud

with
an
infernal
musketry

into

the
experience
of
the
passengers
of
a
java
vessel
during
the
night
of
eighteen
hours
from
the
to
the
of
august
when
a
portion
of
the
island
of
krakatoa
was
hurled
into
the
air
and
the
sea
after
having
first
retreated
swept
upon
the
shore
to
a
height
of
meters
and
to
a
distance
of
from
one
to
ten
kilometers
over
a
of
five
hundred

in
the
reflux
carried
away
with
it

four
cities
tjiringin

the
entire

more
than
forty
thousand

sun
was
extinguished
and
death
seemed
to
reign

this
eruption
moreover
was
of
such
terrific
violence
that
it
was
heard
through
the
earth
at
the
antipodes
it
reached
an
altitude
of
twenty
thousand
meters
producing
an
atmospheric
disturbance
which
made
the
circuit
of
the
entire
globe

hours
the

millimeters

have
direct
evidence

on
the
occasion
of
the
earthquake
at

the

it
is
fitting
that
we
should
devote
a
moment
to
the
consideration
of
these
great

also
to
the
history

in

this
theological

that
our
humble
planet
is
but
an
island
in

infinite
that
human
history
has
thus
far
been
founded
on
pure
illusions

that
the

vii
inexorably
with
a
fatality
no
power
could
arrest
like
a
projectile
speeding
from
the
mouth
of
a
cannon
toward
the
target
the
comet
continued
to
advance
following
its
appointed
path
and
hurrying
with
an
velocity
toward
the
point
in
space
at
which
the
earth
would
be
found
on
the
night
of
july
the
final
calculations
were
absolutely
without
error
these
two
heavenly
earth
and
the
to
meet
like
two
trains
rushing
headlong
upon
each
other
with
resistless
momentum
as
if
impelled
to
mutual
destruction
by
an
insatiable
rage
but
in
the
present
instance
the
velocity
of
shock
would
be
times
that
of
two
express
trains
having
each
a
speed
of
one
hundred
kilometers
per
hour
during
the
night
of
july
the
comet
spread
over
nearly
the
entire
sky
and
whirlwinds
of
fire
could
be
seen
by
the
naked
eye
eddying
about
an
axis
oblique
to
the
zenith
the
appearance
was
that
of
an
army
of
flaming
meteors
in
whose
midst
the
flashing
lightning
produced
the
effect
of
a
furious
combat
the
burning
star
had
a
revolution
of
its
own
and
seemed
to
be
convulsed
with
pain
like
a
living
thing
immense
jets
of
flame
issued
from
various
centers
some
of
a
greenish
hue
others
red
as
blood
while
the
most
brilliant
were
of
a
dazzling
whiteness
it
was
evident
that
the
sun
was
acting
powerfully
upon
this
whirlpool
of
gases
decomposing
certain
of
them
forming
detonating
compounds
electrifying
the
nearer
portions
and
repelling
the
smoke
from
about
the
immense
nucleus
which
was
bearing
down
upon
the
world
the
comet
itself
emitted
a
light
far
different
from
the
sunlight
reflected
by
the
enveloping
vapors
and
its
flames
shooting
forth
in
volume
gave
it
the
appearance
of
a
monster
precipitating
itself
upon
the
earth
to
devour
it
perhaps
the
most
striking
feature
of
this
spectacle
was
the
absence
of
all
sound
at
paris
as
elsewhere
during
that
eventful
night
the
crowd
instinctively
maintained
silence
spellbound
by
an
indescribable
fascination
endeavoring
to
catch
some
echo
of
the
celestial
not
a
sound
was
heard
the
moon
rose
full
showing
green
upon
the
fiery
background
of
the
sky
but
without
brilliancy
and
casting
no
shadows
the
night
was
no
more
night
for
the
stars
had
disappeared
and
the
sky
glowed
with
an
intense
light
the
comet
was
approaching
the
earth
with
a
velocity
of
meters
per
second
or
kilometers
per
minute
that
is
kilometers
per
hour
and
the
earth
was
itself
travelling
through
space
from
west
to
east
at
the
rate
of
meters
per
second
kilometers
per
minute
or
kilometers
per
hour
in
a
direction
oblique
to
the
orbit
of
the
comet
which
for
any
meridian
appeared
at
midnight
in
the
northeast
thus
in
virtue
of
their
velocities
these
two
celestial
bodies
were
nearing
each
other
at
the
rate
of
kilometers
per
hour
when
observation
which
was
in
entire
accord
with
the
computations
previously
made
established
the
fact
that
the
nucleus
of
the
comet
was
at
a
distance
no
greater
than
that
of
the
moon
everyone
knew
that
two
hours
later
the
first
phenomena
of
the
coming
shock
would
begin
contrary
to
all
expectation

the

of
man
were
heartrendingly
sad
humanity
was
prostrated
with
terror
and
the
impassible
calm
of
nature
stood
over
against
the
agonizing
fear
of
the
human
heart
in
painful
and
harrowing
contrast

frightful
anguish

had
bethought
himself
of

the

usually
so
imperious
in
its

the

already
numerous
the
days
of
july
and
had
passed
without
incident
but
with
what
anxiety
the
fateful
night
was
awaited
never
perhaps
had
there
been
so
magnificent
a
sunset
never
a
sky
so
pure
the
orb
of
day
seemed
to
go
down
in
a
sea
of
gold
and
purple
its
red
disc
disappeared
below
the
horizon
but
the
stars
did
not
night
did
not
come
to
the
daylight
succeeded
a
day
of
cometary
and
lunar
splendor
illuminated
by
a
dazzling
light
recalling
that
of
the
aurora
borealis
but
more
intense
emanating
from
an
immense
blazing
focus
which
had
not
been
visible
during
the
day
because
it
had
been
below
the
horizon
but
which
would
certainly
have
rivalled
the
sun
in
brilliancy
amid
the
universal
plaint
of
nature
this
luminous
center
rose
in
the
west
almost
at
the
same
time
with
the
full
moon
which
climbed
the
sky
with
it
like
a
sacrificial
victim
ascending
the
funeral
pyre
the
moon
paled
as
it
mounted
higher
but
the
comet
increased
in
brightness
as
the
sun
sank
below
the
western
horizon
and
now
when
the
hour
of
night
had
come
it
reigned
supreme
a
vaporous
scarlet
sun
with
flames
of
yellow
and
green
like
immense
extended
wings
to
the
terrified
spectator
it
seemed
some
enormous
giant
taking
sovereign
possession
of
earth
and
sky
already
the
cometary
fringes
had
invaded
the
lunar
orbit
at
any
moment
they
would
reach
the
rarer
limits
of
the
earth
s
atmosphere
only
two
hundred
kilometers
away
then
everyone
beheld
as
it
were
a
vast
conflagration
kindled
over
the
whole
extent
of
the
horizon
throwing
skyward
little
violet
flames
and
almost
immediately
the
brilliancy
of
the
comet
diminished
doubtless
because
just
before
touching
the
earth
it
had
entered
into
the
shadow
of
the
planet
and
had
lost
that
part
of
its
light
which
came
from
the
sun
this
apparent
decrease
in
brilliancy
was
chiefly
due
to
contrast
for
when
the
eye
less
dazzled
had
become
accustomed
to
this
new
light
it
seemed
almost
as
intense
as
the
former
but
of
a
sickly
lurid
sepulchral
hue
never
before
had
the
earth
been
bathed
in
such
a
light
which
at
first
seemed
to
be
colorless
emitting
lightning
flashes
from
its
pale
and
wan
depths
the
dryness
of
the
air
hot
as
the
breath
of
a
furnace
became
intolerable
and
a
horrible
odor
of
sulphur
probably
due
to
the
ozone
poisoned
the
atmosphere
everyone
believed
his
last
hour
was
at
hand
a
terrible
cry
dominated
every
other
sound
the
earth
is
on
fire
the
earth
is
on
fire
indeed
the
entire
horizon
was
now
illuminated
by
a
ring
of
bluish
flame
surrounding
the
earth
like
the
flames
of
a
funeral
pile
this
as
had
been
predicted
was
the
whose
combustion
in
the
air
produced
suddenly
as
the
terrified
spectator
gazed
silent
and
awestruck
holding
his
very
breath
in
a
stupor
of
fear
the
vault
of
heaven
seemed
rent
asunder
from
zenith
to
horizon
and
from
this
yawning
chasm
as
from
an
enormous
mouth
was
vomited
forth
jets
of
dazzling
greenish
flame
enveloping
the
earth
in
a
glare
so
blinding
that
all
who
had
not
already
sought
shelter
men
and
women
the
old
and
the
young
the
bold
as
well
as
the
timid
all
rushed
with
the
impetuosity
of
an
avalanche
to
the
cellarways
already
choked
with
people
many
were
crushed
to
death
or
succumbed
to
apoplexy
aneurismal
ruptures
and
wild
delirium
resulting
in
brain
fever
on
the
terraces
and
in
the
observatories
however
the
astronomers
had
remained
at
their
posts
and
several
had
succeeded
in
taking
an
uninterrupted
series
of
photographs
of
the
sky
changes
and
from
this
time
but
for
a
very
brief
interval
with
the
exception
of
a
few
courageous
spirits
who
dared
to
gaze
upon
the
awful
spectacle
from
behind
the
windows
of
some
upper
apartment

were
the
sole
witnesses

easily
established

as

having
a
diameter
about
times
that
of

would
be
traversed
not
centrally

at
of
the
distance
from
the

with
a
velocity
of
about
kilometers
per
hour
nearly
forty
minutes
after
the
first
instant
of

the
heat
of
this
incandescent
furnace
and
the
horrible
odor
of
sulphur
became
so
suffocating
that
a
few
moments
more
of
such
torture
would
have
sufficed
to
destroy
every
vestige
of
life
even
the
astronomers
crept
painfully
from
room
to
room
within
the
observatories

they
had
endeavored
to
close
hermetically
and
sought
shelter
in
the
cellars

remain

long
enough

witness
the
explosion
of

formidable
bolide

was
rushing
southward
with
the
velocity
of
lightning

strength
was
lacking

could
breathe
no

the
heat
and
the
dryness
so
destructive
to
every
vital
function
there
was
the
which
was
already
beginning
to
poison
the
atmosphere
the
ears
were
filled
with
a
dull
roaring
sound
the
heart
beat
ever
more
and
more
violently
and
still
this
choking
odor
of
sulphur
at
the
same
time
a
fiery
rain
fell
from
every
quarter
of
the
sky
a
rain
of
shooting
stars
the
immense
majority
of
which
did
not
reach
the
earth
although
many
fell
upon
the
roofs
and
the
fires
which
they
kindled
could
be
seen
in
every
direction
to
these
fires
from
heaven
the
fires
of

now
made
answer
and
the
world
was
surrounded
with
electric
flashes
as
by
an
army
everyone
without
thinking
for
an
instant
of
flight
had
abandoned
all
hope
expecting
every
moment
to
be
buried
in
the
ruins
of
the
world
and
those
who
still
clung
to
each
other
and
whose
only
consolation
was
that
of
dying
together
clung
closer
in
a
last
embrace
but
the
main
body
of
the
celestial
army
had
passed
and
a
sort
of
rarefaction
of
vacuum
was
produced
in
the
atmosphere
perhaps
as
the
result
of
meteoric
explosions
for
suddenly
the
windows
were
shattered
blown
outwards
and
the
doors
opened
of
themselves
a
violent
wind
arose
adding
fury
to
the
conflagration

the
rain

in

by

statement
our
readers
may
remember
although
at
the
instant
of
collision
the
greater
part
of
the
hemisphere
on
the
side
of
the
comet
had
been
effected
by
the
constricting
dryness
the
suffocating
heat
and
the
poisonous
sulphurous
odors
as
well
as
by
deadening
stupor
due
to
the
resistance
encountered
by
the
comet
in
traversing
the
atmosphere
the
supersaturation
of
the
ozone
with
electricity
and
the
mixture
of
nitrogen
protoxide
with
the
upper

the
other
hemisphere
had
experienced
no
other
disturbance
than
that
which
followed
inevitably
from
the
destroyed
atmospheric
equilibrium
fortunately
the
comet
had
only
skimmed
the
earth
and
the
shock
had
not
been
central
doubtless
also
the
attraction
of
the
earth
had
had
much
to
do
with
the
fall
of
the
bolides

no

boundless
folly

the
human
race
that
the
struggle
for

did
not
consist
in
slaughtering
one
another

in
the
conquest
of
nature
that
all
the
resources
of
humanity
were
absolutely
wasted
in
the
bottomless
gulf
of
standing
armies
and
that
the
mere
obligation
of

formulated

an
encroachment
upon

liberty

the
orders
of
diplomats

were

human
credulity
in
early
times
war
had
been
carried
on
between
villages
for
the
advantage
and
glory
of
chieftains
and
this
kind
of
petty
warfare
still
prevailed
in
the
nineteenth
century
between
the
villages
of
central
africa
where
even
young
men
and
women
persuaded
of
their
slavery
were
seen
at
certain
times
to
present
themselves
voluntarily
at
the
places
where
they
were
to
be
sacrificed
reason
having
at
last
begun

had

formed
themselves
into

provinces
contending
with

most
of

were
to
be

especially
among
statesmen
who
declared
that

was
the

have

been
the

forty
million
victims
per

without
truce
or

had
made

corpses

thousand

it
was
not

that
nations
had
been
exhausted
and
ruined
since
in
the
nineteenth
century
alone
they
had
expended
to
this
end
the
sum
of
million
francs
these
divisions
appealing
to
patriotic
sentiments
skillfully
kept
alive

long
prevented
europe
from
imitating
the
example
of
america
in
the
suppression

its
armies

educating
their
children

a
horror

the
barbarities

folly
of

frivolity

all
the
misery
of

was
forced
upon
the

by
conversation
recital
and
reading
in
a
single
generation
this
rational
education
had
freed
the
young
from
this
remnant
of
animalism
and
inculcated
a
sentiment
of
profound
horror
for
all
which
recalled
the
barbarism
of
other
days
still
governments
refused
to
disarm
and
the
war
budget
was
voted
from
year
to
year
it
was
then
that
the
young
girls
resolved
never
to
marry
a
man
who
had
borne
arms
and
they
kept
their
vow
the
early
years
of
this
league
were
trying
ones
even
for
the
young
girls
for
the
choice
of
more
than
one

upon
some
officer
and
but
for
the
universal
reprobation
her
heart
might
have
yielded
there
were
it
is
true
some
desertions
but
as
those
who
formed
these
marriages
were
from
the
outset
despised
and
ostracized
by
society
they
were
not
numerous
public
opinion
was
formed
and
it
was
impossible
to
stem
the
tide
for
about
five
years
there
was
scarcely
a
single
marriage
or
union

citizen
was

soldier

a
confederation

but
never
recoiling
before
questions
represented
by
the
national
flag
the
women
held
their
ground
they
felt
that
truth
was
on
their
side
but
their
firmness
would
deliver
humanity
from
the
slavery
which
oppressed
it
and
that
they
could
not
fail
of
victory
to
the
passionate
objurgations
of
certain
men
they
replied
no
we
will
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
fools
and
if
this
state
of
affairs
continued
they
had
decided
to
keep
their
vow
or
to
emigrate
to
america
where
centuries
before
the
military
system
had
disappeared
the
most
eloquent
appeals
for
disarmament
were
made
at
every
session
to
the
committee
of
administrators
of
the
state
formerly
called
deputies
or
senators
finally
after
a
lapse
of
five
years
face
to
face
with
this
wall
of
feminine
opposition
which
day
by
day
grew
stronger
and
more
impregnable
the
deputies
of
every
country
as
if
animated
by
a
common
motive
eloquently
advocated
the
cause
of

elegantly
placed

grace

rose
so
nobly
from

and
the
bust
that
it
compelled
more
than

the
admiration
of
man

about

hundredth

only
the

former

prophesied
that
in
the
marvellous
progress

man
would
finally
acquire
wings
and
fly
through
the
air
by
his
muscular
force
alone
but
they
had
not
studied
the
origin
of
anthropomorphic
structure
and
had
forgotten
that
for
a
man
to
have
at
the
same
time
arms
and
wings
he
must
belong
to
a
zoölogical
order
of
sextupeds
which
does
not
exist
on
our
planet
for
man
belongs
to
the
quadrupeds
a
type
which
has
been
gradually
modified
but
though
he
had
not
acquired
new
natural
organs
he
had
acquired
artificial
ones
to
say
nothing
of
his
physical
transformation
he
had
conquered
the
region
of
the
air
and
could
soar
in
the
sky
by
light
apparatus
whose
motor
power
was
electricity
and
the
atmosphere
had
become
his
domain
as
it
had
been
that
of
the
birds
it
is
very
probable
that
if
in
the
course
of
ages
a
winged
race
could
have
acquired
by
the
development
of
its
faculties
of
observation
a
brain
analogous
to
that
of
even
the
most
primitive
man
it
would
have
soon
dominated
the
human
species
and
replaced
it
by
a
new
one
winged
race
of
the
same
zoölogical
type
as
the
quadrupeds
and
bipeds
but
the
force
of
gravity
is
an
obstacle
to
any
such
organic
development
of
the
winged
species
and
humanity
grown
more
perfect

remained
master
of
the

time

of

of

of

exceeding
that
of

grosser
manifestations

the

of

a

the
electric

of
attracting

both
living

a
degree

the

their

do
with
the
visibility
of
the
ultra
violet

for
some
time

the
offspring
of
the
once

classes

formed

sickly

in

latent
faculties

faculties
which
had
remained
dormant

perhaps
a
million
years
during
the
earlier
reign

instincts

in
proportion
as
food
based
upon
chemical
principles
was
substituted
for
the
coarse
nourishment
which

prevailed
for

long
a

these
faculties
came

is

everyone
knows
the
legend
of
the
arab
of
kazwani
as
related
by
a
traveller
of
the
thirteenth
century
who
at
that
time
moreover
had
no
idea
of
the
duration
of
the
epochs
of
nature
passing
one
day
he
said
by
a
very
ancient
and
very
populous
city
i
asked
one
of
its
inhabitants
how
long
a
time
it
had
been
founded
truly
he
replied
it
is
a
powerful
city
but
we
do
not
know
how
long
it
has
existed
and
our
ancestors
are
as
ignorant
upon
this
subject
as
illustration
the
chinese
five
centuries
later
i
passed
by
the
same
spot
and
could
perceive
no
trace
of
the
city
i
asked
a
peasant
who
was
gathering
herbs
on
its
former
site
how
long
it
had
been
destroyed
of
a
truth
he
replied
that
is
a
strange
question
this
field
has
always
been
what
it
now
but
was
there
not
formerly
a
splendid
city
here
i
asked
never
he
answered
at
least
so
far
as
we
can
judge
from
what
we
have
seen
and
our
fathers
have
never
told
us
of
any
such
on
my
return
five
hundred
years
later
to
the
same
place
i
found
it
occupied
by
the
sea
on
the
shore
stood
a
group
of
fishermen
of
whom
i
asked
at
what
period
the
land
had
been
covered
by
the
ocean
is
that
question
worthy
of
a
man
like
you
they
replied
this
spot
has
always
been
such
as
you
see
it
at
the
end
of
five
hundred
years
i
returned
again
and
the
sea
had
disappeared
i
inquired
of
a
solitary
man
whom
i
encountered
when
this
change
had
taken
place
and
he
gave
me
the
same
reply
finally
after
an
equal
lapse
of
time
i
returned
once
more
to
find
a
flourishing
city
more
populous
and
richer
in
monuments
than
that
which
i
had
at
first
visited
and
when
i
sought
information
as
to
its
origin
its
inhabitants
replied
the
date
of
its
foundation
is
lost
in
antiquity
we
do
not
know
how
long
it
has
existed
and
our
fathers
knew
no
more
of
this
than
we
how
this
fable
illustrates
the
brevity
of
human
memory
and
the
narrowness
of
our
horizons
in
time
as
well
as
in
space
we
think
that
the
earth
has
always
been
what
it
now
is
we
conceive
with
difficulty
of
the
secular
changes
through
which
it

passed
the
vastness
of
these
periods
overwhelms
us

the

the

seas
had
replaced

at
the

of

the

continents
had
taken
the
place

at

already
encroached

the

the

increased

the

the

and
continents
had
so
changed
that
it
would
have
been
absolutely
impossible
to
make
out
the
ancient
geographical
maps
of

the

does
not
deal
with

like
the

of
the
thirteenth

mentioned
in
the

this

would
scarcely
suffice
to
modify
sensibly
the

five
thousand

are
but
a
ripple
on
the
ocean
of
time
it
is
by
tens
of
thousands
of
years
that
one
must
reckon
if
one
would
see
continents
sink
below
the
level
of
seas
and
new
territories
emerging
into
the
sunlight
as
the
result
of
the
secular
changes
in
the
level
of
the
earth
s
crust
whose
thickness
and
density
varies
from
place
to
place
and
whose
weight
resting
upon
the
still
plastic
and
mobile
interior
causes
vast
areas
to
oscillate
a
slight
disturbance
of
the
equilibrium
an
insignificant
dip
of

a
change
of
less
than
a
hundred
meters
often
in
the
length
of
the
earth
s
diameter
of
twelve
thousand
kilometers
is
sufficient
to
transform
the
surface
of
the

and
if
we
examine
the
ensemble
of
the
history
of
the
earth
by
periods
of
one
hundred
thousand
years
for
example
we
see
that
in
ten
of
these
great
epochs
that
is
in
a
million
years
the
surface
of
the
globe
has
been
many
times
transformed
if
we
advance
into
the
future
a
period
of
one
or
two
million
years
we
witness
a
vast
flux
and
reflux
of
life

things
how
many
times
in
this
period
of
ten
or
twenty
thousand
centuries
how
many
times
have
the

of
the

how
many

from
the
abysses
of

primitive

the

liquid
planet
was
covered
only
by
a
thin
shell
cooling
on
the
surface
of
the
burning
ocean
within
these
changes
took
place
brusquely
by
sudden
breaking
down
of
natural
barriers
earthquakes
volcanic
eruptions
and
the
uprising
of
mountain
ranges
later
as
this
superficial
crust
grew
thicker
and
became
consolidated
these
transformations
were
more
gradual
the
slow
contraction
of
the
earth
had
led
to
the
formation
of
hollow
spaces
within
the
solid
envelope
to
the
falling
in
of
portions
of
this
envelope
upon
the
liquid
nucleus
and
finally
to
oscillating
movements
which
had
changed

on

hand
the

while
these
great
changes
in
the
planets
were
taking

humanity
had
continued
to
advance
for
progress
is
the
supreme
law
terrestrial
life
which
began
with
the
rudimentary
protozoans
without
mouths
blind
deaf
mute
and
almost
wholly
destitute
of
sensation
had
acquired
successively
the
marvellous
organs
of
sense
and
had
finally
reached
its
climax
in
man
who
having
also
grown
more
perfect
with
the
lapse
of
centuries
had
risen
from
his
primitive
savage
condition
as
the
slave
of
nature
to
the
position
of
a
sovereign
who
ruled
the
world
by
mind
and
who
had
made
it
a
paradise
of
happiness
of
pure
contemplation
of
knowledge
and
of
pleasure
men
had
attained
that
degree
of
intelligence
which
enabled
them
to
live
wisely
and
tranquilly
after
a
general
disarmament
had
been
brought
about
so
rapid
an
increase
in
public
riches
and
so
great
an
amelioration
in
the
of
every
citizen
was
observed
that
the
efforts
of
intelligence
and
labor
no
longer
wasted
by
this
intellectual
suicide
had
been
directed
to
the
conquest
of
new
forces
of
nature
and
the
constant
improvement
of
civilization
the
human
body
had
become
insensibly
transformed
or
more
exactly
transfigured
nearly
all
men
were
intelligent
they
remembered
with
a
smile
the
childish
ambitions
of
their
ancestors
whose
aspiration
was
to
be
rather
than
and
who
had
struggled
so
feverishly
for
outward
show
they
had
learned
that
happiness
resides
in
the
soul
that
contentment
is
found
only
in
study
that
love
is
the
sun
of
the
heart
that
life
is
short
and
ought
not
to
be
lived
superficially
and
thus
all
were
happy
in
the
possession
of
liberty
of
conscience
and
careless
of
those
things
which
one
can
not
carry

had
lost
the

prolonged

one

existed
on
the

which
like
a

everything

the

with
its

was
from
the
very
beginning
the
natural
result
of
the
vital
evolution
of
the
planet
under
the
law
of
progress
it
had
emerged
from
the
limbo
of
animalism
and
by
the
continued
action
of
this
same
law
of
progress
it
had
become
gradually
perfected
modified
and
refined
but
the
time
had
come
when
the
conditions
of
terrestrial
life
began
to
fail
when
humanity
instead
of
advancing
was
itself
to
enter
upon
its
downward
path
the
internal
heat
of
the
globe
still
considerable
in
the
nineteenth
century
although
it
had
ceased
to
have
any
effect
upon

temperature
which
was
maintained
solely
by
the
sun
had
slowly
diminished
and
the
earth
had
at
last
become
entirely
cold
this
had
not
directly
influenced
the
physical
conditions
of
terrestrial
life
which
continued
to
depend
upon
the
atmosphere
and
solar
heat
the
cooling
of
the
earth
can
not
bring
about
the
end
of
the
world
imperceptibly
from
century
to
century
the
earth
s
surface
had
become
levelled
the
action
of
the
rain
snow
frost
and
solar
heat
upon
the
mountains
the
waters
of
torrents
rivulets
and
rivers
had
slowly
carried
to
the
sea
the
débris
of
every
continental
elevation
the
bottom
of
the
sea
had
risen
and
in
nine
million
years
the
mountains
had
almost
entirely
disappeared
meanwhile
the
planet
had
grown
old
faster
than
the
sun
the
conditions
favorable
to
life
had
disappeared
more
rapidly
than
the
solar
light
and
heat
this
conception
of
the
planet
s
future
conforms
to
our
present
knowledge
of
the
universe
doubtless
our
logic
is
radically
incomplete
puerile
even
in
comparison
with
the
real
and
eternal
truth
and
might
be
justly
compared
with
that
of
two
ants
talking
together
about
the
history
of
france
but
confessing
the
modesty
which
befits
the
finite
in
presence
of
the
infinite
and
acknowledging
our
nothingness
as
compared
with
the
universe
we
can
not
avoid
the
necessity
of
appearing
logical
to
ourselves
we
can
not
assume
that
the
abdication
of
reason
is
a
better
proof
of
wisdom
than
the
use
of
it
we
believe
that
an
intelligent
order
presides
over
the
universe
and
controls
the
destiny
of
worlds
and
their
inhabitants
that
the
larger
members
of
the
solar
system
must
last
longer
than
the
lesser
ones
and
consequently
that
the
life
of
each
planet
is
not
equally
dependent
upon
the
sun
and
can
not
therefore
continue
indefinitely
any
more
than
the
sun
itself
moreover
direct
observation
confirms
this
general
conception
of
the
universe
the
earth
an
extinct
sun
has
cooled
more
rapidly
than
the
sun
jupiter
so
immense
is
still
in
its
youth
the

smaller
than

has
reached
the
more
advanced
stages
of

perhaps

an

element
of

water
regulated
terrestrial
life
from
the
very
beginning
this
element
had
entered
into
the
composition
of
every
substance
vegetable
animal
and
human
it
formed
the
active
principle
of
atmospheric
circulation
it
was
the
chief
agent
in
the
changes
of
climate
and

it
was
the
sovereign
of
the
terrestrial
state
from
century
to
century
the
quantity
of
water
in
the
sea
the
rivers
and
the
atmosphere
diminished
a
portion
of
the
rain
water
was
absorbed
by
the
earth
and
did
not
return
to
the
sea
for
instead
of
flowing
into
the
sea
over
impermeable
strata
and
so
forming
either
springs
or
subterranean
and
submarine
watercourses
it
had
filtered
deeper
within
the
surface
insensibly
filling
every
void
every
fissure
and
saturating
the
rocks
to
a
great
depth
so
long
as
the
internal
heat
of
the
globe
was
sufficient
to
prevent
the
indefinite
descent
of
this
water
and
to
convert
it
into
vapor
a
considerable
quantity
remained
upon
the
surface
but
the
time
came
when
the
internal
heat
of
the
globe
was
entirely
dispersed
in
space
and
offered
no
obstacle
to
infiltration
then
the
surface
water
gradually
diminished
it
united
with
the
rocks
in
the
form
of
hydrates
and
thus
disappeared
from
circulation
indeed
were
the
loss
of
the
surface
water
of
the
globe
to
amount
only
to
a
few
tenths
of
a
millimeter
yearly
in
ten
million
years
none
would
remain
this
vapor
of
water
in
the
atmosphere
had
made
warmth
and
life
possible
with
its
disappearance
came
cold
and
death
if
at
present
the
aqueous
vapor
of
the
atmosphere
should
disappear
the
heat
of
the
sun
would
be
incapable
of
maintaining
animal
and
vegetable
life
life
which
moreover
could
not
exist
inasmuch
as
vegetables
and
animals
are
chiefly
composed
of
water
footnote
of
all
terrestrial
substances
water
has
the
greatest
specific
heat
it
cools
more
slowly
than
any
other
its
specific
heat
is
four
times
greater
than
that
of
air
when
the
temperature
of
a
kilogram
of
water
falls
one
degree
it
raises
the
temperature
of
four
kilograms
of
air
one
degree
but
water
is
seven
hundred
and
seventy
times
heavier
than
air
so
that
if
we
compare
two
equal
volumes
of
water
and
air
we
find
that
a
cubic
meter
of
water
in
losing
one
degree
of
temperature
raises
the
temperature
of
seven
hundred
and
seventy
times
four
or
cubic
meters
of
air
by
the
same
amount
this
is
the
explanation
of
the
influence
of
the
sea
in
modifying
the
climate
of
continents
the
heat
of
summer
is
stored
in
the
ocean
and
is
slowly
given
out
in
winter
this
explains
why
islands
and
seashores
have
no
extremes
of
climate
the
heat
of
summer
is
tempered
by
the
breezes
and
the
cold
of
winter
is
alleviated
by
the
heat
stored
in
the
water
the
invisible
vapor
of
water
distributed
through
the
atmosphere
exercises
the
greatest
possible
influence
on
temperature
in
quantity
this
vapor
seems
almost
negligible
since
oxygen
and
nitrogen
alone
form
and
per
cent
of
the
air
we
breathe
and
the
remaining
of
one
per
cent
contains
besides
the
vapor
of
water
carbonic
acid
ammonia
and
other
substances
there
is
scarcely
more
than
a
quarter
of
one
per
cent
of
aqueous
vapor
if
we
consider
the
constituent
atoms
of
the
atmosphere
the
physicist
tells
us
that
for
two
hundred
atoms
of
oxygen
and
nitrogen
there
is
scarcely
one
of
but
this
one
atom
has
eighty
times
more
absorptive
energy
than
the
two
hundred
others
the
radiant
heat
of
the
sun
after
traversing
the
atmosphere
warms
the
surface
of
the
earth
the
heat
waves
reflected
from
the
warmed
earth
are
not
lost
in
space
the
aqueous
vapor
atoms
acting
like
a
barrier
turn
them
back
and
preserve
them
for
our
benefit
this
is
one
of
the
most
brilliant
and
the
most
fruitful
discoveries
of
modern
physics
the
oxygen
and
nitrogen
molecules
of
dry
air
do
not
oppose
the
radiation
of
heat
but
as
we
have
just
said
one
molecule
of
possesses
eighty
times
the
absorptive
energy
of
the
other
two
hundred
molecules
of
dry
air
and
consequently
such
a
molecule
is
sixteen
thousand
times
more
efficacious
in
so
far
as
the
conservation
of
heat
is
concerned
so
that
it
is
the
vapor
of
water
and
not
the
air
properly
speaking
which
regulates
the
conditions
of
life
upon
the
earth
if
one
should
remove
this
vapor
from
the
surrounding
atmosphere
a
loss
of
heat
would
go
on
at
the
surface
similar
to
that
which
takes
place
in
high
altitudes
for
the
atmosphere
would
then
be
as
powerless
to
retain
heat
as
a
vacuum
is
a
cold
like
that
at
the
surface
of
the
moon
would
be
the
result
the
soil
would
still
receive
heat
directly
from
the
sun
but
even
during
the
daytime
this
heat
would
not
be
retained
and
after
sunset
the
earth
would
be
exposed
to
the
glacial
cold
of
space
which
appears
to
be
about
below
zero
thus
vegetable
animal
and
human
life
would
be
impossible
if
it
had
not
already
become
so
through
the
very
disappearance
of
the
water
certainly
we
may
and
must
admit
that

not

was
neither
rain
nor
snow
the
sun
less
dazzling
and
less
hot
than
formerly
shone
with
the
yellowish
splendor
of
a
topaz
the
color
of
the
sky
was
rather
than
blue
the
volume
of
the
atmosphere
had
diminished
considerably
its
oxygen
and
nitrogen
had
become
in
part
fixed
in
metallic
combinations
as
oxides
and
nitrides
and
its
carbonic
acid
had
slowly
increased
as
vegetation
deprived
of
water
became
more
and
more
rare
and
absorbed
an
ever
decreasing
amount
of
this
gas
but
the
mass
of
the
earth
owing
to
the
constant
fall
of
meteorites
bolides
and
uranolites
had
increased
with
time
so
that
the
atmosphere
though
considerably
less
in
volume
had
retained
its
density
and
exerted
nearly
the
same
pressure
strangely
enough
the
snow
and
ice
had
diminished
as
the
earth
grew
cold
the
cause
of
this
low
temperature
was
the
absence
of
water
vapor
from
the
atmosphere
which
had
decreased
with
the
superficial
area
of
the
sea
as
the
water
penetrated
the
interior
of
the
earth
and
the
general
level
became
more
uniform
first
the
depth
and
then
the
area
of
seas
had
been
reduced
the
invisible
envelope
of
aqueous
vapor
had
lost
its
protecting
power
and
the
day
came
when
the
return
of
the
heat
received
from
the
sun
was
no
longer
prevented
it
was
radiated
into
space
as
rapidly
as
it
was
received
as
if
it
fell
upon
a
mirror
incapable
of
absorbing
its
rays
such
was
the
condition
of
the
earth
the
last
representatives
of
the
human
race
had
survived
all
these
physical
transformations
solely
by
virtue
of
its
genius
of
invention
and
power
of
adaptation
its
last
efforts
had
been
directed
toward
extracting
nutritious
substances
from
the
air
from
subterranean
water
and
from
plants
and
replacing
the
vanished
vapor
of
the
air
by
buildings
and
roofs
of
glass
it
was
necessary
at
any
cost
to
capture
these
solar
rays
and
to
prevent
their
radiation
into
space
it
was
easy
to
store
up
this
heat
in
large
quantities
for
the
sun
shone
unobscured
by
any
cloud
and
the
day
was
hours
for
a
long
time
the
efforts
of
architects
had
been
solely
directed
towards
this
imprisonment
of
the
sun
s
rays
and
the
prevention
of
their
dispersion
during
the
hours
of
the
night
they
had
succeeded
in
accomplishing
this
by
an
ingenious
arrangement
of
glass
roofs
superposed
one
upon
the
other
and
by
movable
screens
all
combustible
material
had
long
before
been
exhausted
and
even
the
hydrogen
extracted
from
water
was
difficult
to
obtain
the
mean
temperature
in
the
open
air
during
the
daytime
was
not
very
low
not
falling
below
notwithstanding
the
changes
which
the
ages
had
wrought
in
vegetable
life
no
species
of
plants
could
exist
even
in
this
equatorial
zone
footnote
many
readers
will
regard
this
climate
quite
bearable
inasmuch
as
in
our
own
day
regions
may
be
cited
whose
mean
temperature
is
much
lower
yet
which
are
nevertheless
habitable
as
for
example
verchnoiansk
whose
mean
annual
temperature
is
but
in
these
regions
there
is
a
summer
during
which
the
ice
melts
and
if
in
january
the
temperature
falls
to
and
even
lower
in
july
they
enjoy
a
temperature
of
fifteen
and
twenty
degrees
above
zero
but
at
the
stage
which
we
have
now
reached
in
the
history
of
the
world
this
mean
temperature
of
the
equatorial
zone
was
constant
and
it
was
impossible
for
ice
ever
to
melt
again
as
for
the
other
latitudes
they
had
been
totally
uninhabitable
for
thousands
of
years
in
spite
of
every
effort
made
to
live
in
them
in
the
latitudes
of
paris
nice
rome
naples
algiers
and
tunis
all
protective
atmospheric
action
had
ceased
and
the
oblique
rays
of
the
sun
had
proved
insufficient
to
warm
the
soil
which
was
frozen
to
a
great
depth
like
a
veritable
block
of
ice
the
world
s
population
had
gradually
diminished
from
ten
milliards
to
nine
to
eight
and
then
to
seven
the
surface
of
the
globe
being
then
habitable
as
the
habitable
zone
became
more
and
more
restricted
to
the
equator
the
population
had
still
further
diminished
as
had
also
the
mean
length
of
human
life
and
the
day
came
when
only
a
few
hundred
millions
remained
scattered
in
groups
along
the
equator
and
maintaining
life
only
by
the
artifices
of
a
laborious
and
scientific
industry
later
still
toward
the
end
only
two
groups
of
a
few
hundred
human
beings
were
left
occupying
the
last
surviving
centers
of
industry
from
all
the
rest
of
the
globe
the
human
race
had
slowly
but
inexorably
up
exhausted
degenerated
from
century
to
century
through
the
lack
of
an
assimilable
atmosphere
and
sufficient
food
its
last
remnants
seemed
to
have
lapsed
back
into
barbarism
vegetating
like
the
esquimaux
of
the
north
these
two
ancient
centers
of
civilization
themselves
yielding
to
decay
had
survived
only
at
the
cost
of
a
constant
struggle
between
industrial
genius
and
implacable
nature
even
here
between
the
tropics
and
the
equator
the
two
remaining
groups
of
human
beings
which
still
contrived
to
exist
in
face
of
a
thousand
hardships
which
yearly
became
more
insupportable
did
so
only
by
subsisting
so
to
speak
on
what
their
predecessors
had
left
behind
these
two
ocean
valleys
one
of
which
was
near
the
bottom
of
what
is
now
the
pacific
ocean
the
other
to
the
south
of
the
present
island
of
ceylon
had
formerly
been
the
sites
of
two
immense
cities
of
and
glass
having
been
for
a
long
time
the
materials
chiefly
employed
in
building
construction
they
resembled
vast
without
upper
stories
with
transparent
ceilings
of
immense
height
here
were
to
be
found
the
last
plants
except
those
cultivated
in
the
subterranean
galleries
leading
to
rivers
flowing
under
ground
elsewhere
the
surface
of
the
earth
was
a
ruin
and
even
here
only
the
last
vestiges
of
a
vanished
greatness
were
to
be
seen
illustration
the
sole
in
the
first
of
these
ancient
cities
of
glass
the
sole
survivors
were
two
old
men
and
the
grandson
of
one
of
them
omegar
who
had
seen
his
mother
and
sisters
die
one
after
the
other
of
consumption
and
who
now
wandered
in
despair
through
these
vast
solitudes
of
these
old
men
one
had
formerly
been
a
philosopher
and
had
consecrated
his
long
life
to
the
study
of
the
history
of
perishing
humanity
the
other
was
a
physician
who
had
in
vain
sought
to
save
from
consumption
the
last
inhabitants
of
the
world
their
bodies
seemed
wasted
by
anæmia
rather
than
by
age
they
were
pale
as
specters
with
long
white
beards
and
only
their
moral
energy
sustained
them
yet
an
instant
against
the
decree
of
destiny
but
they
could
not
struggle
longer
against
this
destiny
and
one
day
omegar
found
them
stretched
lifeless
side
by
side
from
the
dying
hands
of
one
fell
the
last
history
ever
written
the
history
of
the
final

a

the

also
the

humanity
horses
dogs
reindeers

certain
large
birds
used
in
aerial
service
yet
survived
but
so
entirely
changed
that
they
bore
no
resemblance
to
their
progenitors
it
was
evident
that
the
race
was
irrevocably
doomed
science
had
disappeared
with
scientists
art
with
artists
and
the
survivors
lived
only
upon
the
past
the
heart
knew
no
more
hope
the
spirit
no
ambition
the
light
was
in
the
past
the
future
was
an
eternal
night
all
was
over
the
glories
of
days
gone
by
had
forever
vanished
if
in
preceding
centuries
some
traveller
wandering
in
these
solitudes
thought
he
had
rediscovered
the
sites
of
paris
rome
or
the
brilliant
capitals
which
had
succeeded
them
he
was
the
victim
of
his
own
imagination
for
these
sites
had
not
existed
for
millions
of
years
having
been
swept
away
by
the
waters
of
the
sea
vague
traditions
had
floated
down
through
the
ages
thanks
to
the
and
the
recorders
of
the
great
events
of
history
but
even
these
traditions
were
uncertain
and
often
false
for
as
to
paris
the
annals
of
history
contained
only
some
references
to
a
maritime
paris
of
its
existence
as
the
capital
of
france
for
thousands
of
years
there
was
no
trace
nor
memory
the
names
which
to
us
seem
immortal
confucius
plato
mahomet
alexander
cæsar
charlemagne
and
napoleon
had
perished
and
were
forgotten
art
had
indeed
preserved
noble
memories
but
these
memories
did
not
extend
as
far
back
as
the
infancy
of
humanity
and
reached
only
a
few
million
years
into
the
past
omegar
lingered
in
an
ancient
gallery
of
pictures
bequeathed
by
former
centuries
and
contemplated
the
great
cities
which
had
disappeared
only
one
of
these
pictures
related
to
what
had
once
been
europe
and
was
a
view
of
paris
consisting
of
a
promontory
projecting
into
the
sea
crowned
by
an
astronomical
temple
and
gay
with
helicopterons
circling
above
the
lofty
towers
of
its
terraces
immense
ships
were
plowing
the

this
classic
paris
was
the
paris
of
the
one
hundred
and
seventieth
century
of
the
christian
era
corresponding
to
the
one
hundred
and
of
the
astronomical
paris
which
existed
immediately
prior
to
the
final
submergence
of
the
land
even
its
name
had
changed
for
words
change
like
persons

other

portrayed
the
great

less
ancient
cities
which
had
risen
in
america
australia
asia
and
afterwards
upon
the
continents
which
had
emerged
from
the
ocean
and
so
this
museum
of
the

recalled
in
succession
the
passing
pomps
of

down
to

all

struck
on

omegar
knew
the
life
of
the
world
henceforth
was
in
the
past
that
no
future
existed
for
it
and
that
the
present
even
was
vanishing
like
the
dream
of
a
moment
the
last
heir
of
the
human
race
felt
the
overwhelming
sentiment
of
the
vanity
of
things
should
he
wait
for
some
inconceivable
miracle
to
save
him
from
his
fate
should
he
bury
his

and
share
their
tomb
with
them
should
he
endeavor
to
prolong
for
a
few
days
a
few
weeks
a
few

even
a
solitary
useless
and
despairing
existence
all
day
long
he
wandered
through
the
vast
and
silent
galleries
and
at
night
abandoned
himself
to
the
drowsiness
which
oppressed
him
all
about
him
was
darkness
of
the
sepulchre
a
sweet
dream
however
stirred
his
slumbering
thought
and
surrounded
his
soul
with
a
halo
of
angelic
brightness
sleep
brought
him
the
illusion
of
life
he
was
no
longer
alone
a
seductive
image
which
he
had
seen
more
than
once
before
stood
before
him
eyes
caressing
as
the
light
of
heaven
deep

the
infinite

upon
him

birds
sang
in
the
nests
amid
the
foliage
and
in
the
distant
landscape
framed
in
plants
and
flowers
were
the
vast
ruins
of
dead
cities
then
he
saw
a
lake
on
whose
rippling
surface
two
swans
glided
bearing
a
cradle
from
which
a
child
stretched
toward
him
its
arms
never
had
such
a
ray
of
light
illuminated
his
soul
so
deep
was
his
emotion
that
he
suddenly
awoke
opened
his
eyes
and
found
confronting
him
only
the
somber
reality
then
a
sadness
more
terrible
even
than
any
he
had
known
filled
his
whole
being
he
could
not
find
an
instant
of
repose
he
rose
went
to
his
couch
and
waited
anxiously
for
the
morning
he
remembered
his
dream
but
he
did
not
believe
in
it
he
felt
vaguely
that
another
human
being
existed
somewhere
but
his
degenerate
race
had
lost
in
part
its
psychic
power
and
perhaps
also
woman
always
exerts
upon
man
an
attraction
more
powerful
than
that
which
man
exerts
upon

when
the
day
broke
when
the
last
man
saw
the
ruins
of
his
ancient
city
standing
out
upon
the
sky
of
dawn
when
he
found
himself
alone
with
the
two
last
dead
he
realized
more
than
ever
his
unavoidable
destiny
and
decided
to
terminate
at
once
a
life
so
hopelessly
miserable
going
into
the
laboratory
he
sought
a
bottle
whose
contents
were
well
known
to
him
uncorked
it
and
carried
it
to
his
lips
to
empty
it
at
a
draught
but
at
the
very
moment
the
vial
touched
his
lips
he
felt
a
hand
upon
his
arm
he
turned
suddenly
there
was
no
one
in
the

in

he

who
had
died
the
night
before
the

sat
alone
doomed
to
death
in
the
very
flower

the
night
was
cold
in
the

the
full

shone
like
a
golden

but
its
yellow

were
as
cold

in
the
vast

reigned
the

that
every

there
was
no

no

only
solitude

silence
the

soon
eternal

the

bygone
days
of
those
who
had
lived
the
real
life
of
humanity
of
lovers
wives
and

but
to
her
red
and
tearless
eyes
appeared
only
images
of
death
while
beyond
the
walls
of
glass
stretched
a
barren
desert
covered
by
the
last
ice
and
the
last
snow
now
her
young
heart
beat
violently
in
her
breast
till
her
slender
hands
could
no
longer
compress
its
tumult
and
now
life
seemed
arrested
in
her
bosom
and
every
respiration
suspended
if
for
a
moment
she
fell
asleep
in
her
dreams
she
played
again
with
her
laughing
and
sister
while
her
mother
sung
in
a
pure
and
penetrating
voice
the
beautiful
inspirations
of
the
last

she
seemed
to
see
once
more
the
last
fêtes

a
brilliant

some
distant

on

tomorrow
death
without
having
known
life
to
struggle
against
this
unavoidable
fate
was
useless
the
decree

destiny
was
without
appeal
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
submit
to
await
the
inevitable
end
since
without

organic

was

anticipate
death

oneself

detected
a
smile
upon
her
lips
showing
that
for
an
instant
she
was
oblivious
of
her
dark
future
passing
into
another
room
she
approached
the
apparatus
which
furnished
the
food
of
that
time
extracted
from
the
water
air
and
the
plants
and
fruits
automatically
cultivated
in
the
greenhouses
it
was
still
in
working
order
like
a
clock
which
has
been
wound
up
for
thousands
of
years
the
genius
of
man
had
been
almost
exclusively
applied
to
the
struggle
with
destiny
the
last
remaining
water
had
been
forced
to
circulate
in
subterranean
canals
where
also
the
solar
heat
had
been
stored
the
last
animals
had
been
trained
to
serve
these
machines
and
the
nutritious
properties
of
the
last
plants
had
been
utilized
to
the
utmost
men
had
finally
succeeded
in
living
upon
almost
nothing
so
far
as
quantity
was
concerned
every
newly
discovered
form
of
food
being
completely
assimilable
cities
had
finally
been
built
of
glass
open
to
the
sun
to
which
was
conveyed
every
substance
necessary
to
the
synthesis
of
the
food
which
replaced
the
products
of
nature
but
as
time
passed
it
became
more
and
more
difficult
to
obtain
the
necessaries
of
life
the
mine
was
at
last
exhausted
matter
had
been
conquered
by
intelligence
but
the
day
had
come
when
intelligence
itself
was
overmatched
when
every
worker
had
died
at
his
post
and
the
earth
s
storehouse
had
been
depleted
unwilling
to
abandon
this
desperate
struggle
man
had
put
forth
every
effort
but
he
could
not
prevent
the
earth
s
absorption
of
water
and
the
last
resources
of
a
science
which
seemed
greater
even
than
nature
itself
had
been
exhausted

she
felt
that
another
heard
and
eva
returned
to
the
body
of
her
mother
and
once
more
took
the
cold
hands
in
her
own
the
psychic
faculties
of
the
race
in
these
its
latter
days
had
acquired
as
we
have
said
transcendent
powers
and
she
thought
for
a
moment
to
summon
her
mother
from
the
tomb
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
must
have
one
more
approving
glance
one
more
counsel
a
single
idea
took
possession
of
her
so
fascinating
her
that
she
even
lost
the
desire
to
die
she
saw
afar
the
soul
which
should
respond
to
her
own
every
man
belonging
to
that
company
of
which
she
was
the
last
survivor
had
died
before
her
birth
woman
had
outlived
the
sex
once
called
strong
in
the
pictures
upon
the
walls
of
the
great
library
in
books
engravings
and
statues
she
saw
represented
the
great
men
of
the
city
but
she
had
never
seen
a
living
man
and
still
dreaming
strange
and
disquieting
forms
passed
before
her
she
was
transported
into
an
unknown
and
mysterious
world
into
a
new
life
and
love
did
not
seem
to
be
yet
wholly
banished
from
earth
during
the
reign
of
cold
all
electrical
communication
between
the
two
last
cities
left
upon
the
earth
had
been
interrupted
their
inhabitants
could
speak
no
more
with
each
other
see
each
other
no
more
nor
feel
each
other
s
presence
yet
she
was
as
well
acquainted
with
the
ocean
city
as
if
she
had
seen
it
and
when
she
fixed
her
eyes
upon
the
great
terrestrial
globe
suspended
from
the
ceiling
of
the
library
and
then
closing
them
concentrated
all
her
will
and
psychic
power
upon
the
object
of
her
thoughts
she
acted
at
a
distance
as
effectively
though
in
a
different
way
as
in
former
days
men
had
done
when
communicating
with
each
other
by
electricity
she
called
and
felt
that
another
heard
and
understood
the
preceding
night
she
had
transported
herself
to
the
ancient
city
in
which
omegar
lived
and
had
appeared
to
him
for
an
instant
in
a
dream
that
very
morning
she
had
witnessed
his
despairing
act
and
by
a
supreme
effort
of
the
will
had
arrested
his
arm
and
now
stretched
in
her
chair
beside
the
dead
body
of
her
mother
heavy
with
sleep
her
solitary
soul
wandered
in
dreams
above
the
ocean
city
seeking
the
companionship
of
the
only
mate
left
upon
the
earth
and
far
away
in
that
ocean
city
omegar
heard
her
call
slowly
as
in
a
dream
he
ascended
the
platform
from
which
the
used
to
take
their
flight
yielding
to
a
mysterious
influence
he
obeyed
the
distant
summons
speeding
toward
the
west
the
electric
passed
above
the
frozen
regions
of
the
tropics
once
the
site
of
the
pacific
ocean
polynesia
malaisia
and
the
sunda
islands
and
stopped
at
the
landing
of
the
crystal
palace
the
young
girl
startled
from
her
dream
by
the
traveller
who
fell
from
the
air
at
her
feet
fled
in
terror
to
the
farther
end
of
the
immense
hall
lifting
the
heavy
curtain
of
skin
which
separated
it
from
the
library
when
the
young
man
reached
her
side
he
stopped
knelt
and
took
her
hand
in
his
saying
simply
you
called
me
i
have
and
then
he
added
i
have
known
you
for
a
long
time
i
knew
that
you
existed
i
have
often
seen
you
you
are
the
constant
thought
of
my
heart
but
i
did
not
dare
to
illustration
you
called
me
i

bade
him
rise
saying
my
friend
i
know
that
we
are
alone
in
the
world
and
that
we
are
about
to
die
a
will
stronger
than
my
own
compelled
me
to
call
you
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
the
supreme
desire
of
my
mother
supreme
even
in
death
see
she
sleeps
thus
since
yesterday
how
long
the
night
is
the
young
man
kneeling
had
taken
the
hand
of
the
dead
and
they
both
stood
there
beside
the
funeral
couch
as
if
in
prayer
he
leaned
gently
toward
the
young
girl
and
their
heads
touched
he
let
fall
the
hand
of
the
dead
eva
shuddered
no
she
said
then
suddenly
he
sprang
to
his
feet
in
terror
the
dead
woman
had
revived
she
had
withdrawn
the
hand
which
he
had
taken
in
his
own
and
had
opened
her
eyes
she
made
a
movement
looking
at
them
illustration
behold
where
we
shall
be
tomorrow
i
wake
from
a
strange
dream
she
said
without
seeming
surprised
at
the
presence
of
omegar
behold
my
children
my
dream
and
she
pointed
to
the
planet
jupiter
shining
with
dazzling
splendor
in
the
sky
and
as
they
gazed
upon
the
star
to
their
astonished
vision
it
appeared
to
approach
them
to
grow
larger
to
take
the
place
of
the
frozen
scene
about
them
its
immense
seas
were
covered
with
ships
aerial
fleets
cleaved
the
air
the
shores
of
its
seas
and
the
mouths
of
its
great
rivers

the
scenes
of
a
prodigious

brilliant
cities

peopled
by
moving
multitudes
neither
the
details
of
their
habitations
nor
the
forms
of
these
new
beings
could
be
distinguished
but
one
divined
that
here
was
a
humanity
quite
different
from
ours
living
in
the
bosom
of
another
nature
having
other
senses
at
its
disposal
and
one
felt
also
that
this
vast
world
was
incomparably
superior
to
the

bent

face

they
perceived
that

forehead
was

all

was
not

final
doom
of
the
world
yet
far
distant
omegar
bent
every
energy
to
the
maintenance
of
the
marvellous
system
which
had
been
devised
for
the
automatic
extraction
by
chemical
processes
of
the
nutritive
principles
of
the
air
water
and
plants
and
in
this
he
seemed
to
be
successful
so
in
other
days
after
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
the
barbarians
had
been
seen
to
utilize
during
centuries
the
aqueducts
baths
and
thermal
springs
all
the
creations
of
the
civilization
of
the
cæsars
and
to
draw
from
a
vanished
industry
the
sources
of
their
own
strength
but
one
day
wonderful
as
it
was
this
system
gave
out
the
subterranean
waters
themselves
ceased
to
flow
the
soil
was
frozen
to
a
great
depth
the
rays
of
the
sun
still
warmed
the
air
within
the
dwellings
but
no
plant
could
live
longer
the
supply
of
water
was
exhausted
the
combined
efforts
of
science
and
industry
were
impotent
to
give
to
the
atmosphere
the
nutritive
qualities
possessed
by
those
of
other
worlds
and
the
human
organism
constantly
clamored
for
the
regenerating
principles
which
as
we
have
seen
had
been
derived
from
the
air
water
and
plants
these
sources
were
now
exhausted
this
last
human
pair
struggled
against
these
insurmountable
obstacles
and
recognized
the
uselessness
of
farther
contest
yet
they
were
not
resigned
to
death
before
knowing
each
other
they
had
awaited
it
fearlessly
now
each
wished
to
defend
the
other
the
beloved
one
against
pitiless
destiny
the
very
idea
of
seeing
omegar
lying
inanimate
beside
her
filled
eva
with
such
anguish
that
she
could
not
bear
the
thought
and
he
too
vainly
longed
to
carry
away
his
well
beloved
from
a
world
doomed
to
decay
to
fly
with
her
to
that
brilliant
jupiter
which
awaited
them
and
not
to
abandon
to
the
earth
the
body
he
adored
he
thought
that
perhaps
there
still
existed
somewhere
upon
the
earth
a
spot
which
had
retained
a
little
of
that
water
without
which
existence
was
impossible
and
although
already
they
were
both
almost
without
strength
he
formed
the
supreme
resolution
of
setting
out
to
seek
for
it
the
electric
aeronef
was
still
in
working
order
forsaking
the
city
which
was
now
only
a
tomb
the
two
last
survivors
of
a
vanished
humanity
abandoned
these
inhospitable
regions
and
set
out
to
seek
some
unknown
oasis
the
ancient
kingdoms
of
the
world
passed
under
their
feet
they
saw
the
remains
of
great
cities
made
illustrious
by
the
splendors
of
civilization
lying
in
ruins
along
the
equator
the
silence
of
death
covered
them
all
omegar
recognized
the
ancient
city
which
he
had
recently
left
but
he
knew
that
there
also
the
supreme
source
of
life
was
lacking
and
they
did
not
stop
they
traversed
thus
in
their
solitary
the
regions
which
had
witnessed
the
last
stages
of
the
life
of
humanity
but
death
and
silence
and
the
frozen
desert
was
everywhere
no
more
fields
no
more
vegetation
the
watercourses
were
visible
as
on
a
map
and
it
was
evident
that
along
their
banks
life
had
been
prolonged
but
they
were
now
dried
up
forever
and
when
at
times
some
motionless
lake
was
distinguished
in
the
lower

it
was
like
a
lake
of
stone

even
at
the
equator
the
sun

powerless

melt
the
eternal
ice
a
kind

long
fur

wandering
over
the
frozen

a
frozen

the

be
as
the

the
present
is
of
no
importance
in
examining
the
past
history
of
the
earth
we
might
go
back
to
a
time
when
our
planet
shone
in
space
a
veritable
sun
appearing
as
jupiter
and
saturn
do
now
shrouded
in
a
dense
atmosphere
charged
with
warm
vapors
and
we
might
follow
all
its
transformations
down
to
the
period
of
man
we
have
seen
that
when
its
heat
was
entirely
dissipated
its
waters
absorbed
the
aqueous
vapor
of
its
atmosphere
gone
and
this
atmosphere
itself
more
or
less
absorbed
our
planet
must
have
presented
the
appearance
of
those
great
lunar
deserts
seen
through
the
telescope
with
certain
differences
due
to
the
action
of
causes
peculiar
to
the
earth
with
its
final
geographical
configurations
its
shores
and
a
planetary
corpse
a
dead
and
frozen
world
it
still
bears
however
within
its
bosom
an
unexpended
of
its
motion
of
translation
about
the
sun
an
energy
which
transformed
into
heat
by
the
sudden
destruction
of
its
motion
would
suffice
to
melt
it
and
to
reduce
it
in
part
to
a
state
of
vapor
thus
inaugurating
a
new
epoch
but
for
an
instant
only
for
if
this
motion
of
translation
were
destroyed
the
earth
would
fall
into
the
sun
and
its
independent
existence
would
come
to
an
end
if
suddenly
arrested
it
would
move
in
a
straight
line
toward
the
sun
with
an
increasing
velocity
and
reach
the
sun
in
days
were
its
motion
gradually
arrested
it
would
move
in
a
spiral
to
be
swallowed
up
at
last
in
the
central
luminary
the
entire
history
of
terrestrial
life
is
before
our
eyes
it
has
its
commencement
and
its
end
and
its
duration
however
many
the
centuries
which
compose
it
is
preceded
and
followed
by
indeed
but
a
single
instant
lost
in
eternity
for
a
long
time
after
the
earth
had
ceased
to
be
the
abode
of
life
the
colossal
worlds
of
jupiter
and
saturn
passing
more
slowly
from
their
solar
to
their
planetary
stage
reigned
in
their
turn
among
the
planets
with
the
splendor
of
a
vitality
incomparably
superior
to
that
of
our
earth
but
they
also
waxed
old
and
descended
into
the
night
of
the
tomb
χ
had
the
earth
like
jupiter
for
example
retained
long
enough
the
elements
of
life
death
would
have
come
only
with
the
extinction
of
the
sun
but
the
length
of
the
life
of
a
world
is
proportional
to
its
size
and
its
elements
of
vitality
the
solar
heat
is
due
to
two
principal
condensation
of
the
original
nebula
and
the
fall
of
meteorites
according
to
the
best
established
calculations
of
thermodynamics
the
former
has
produced
a
quantity
of
heat
eighteen
million
times
greater
than
that
which
the
sun
radiates
yearly
supposing
the
original
nebula
was
cold
which
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
was
the
case
it
is
therefore
certain
that
the
solar
temperature
produced
by
this
condensation
far
exceeded
the
above
if
condensation
continues
the
radiation
of
heat
may
go
on
for
centuries
without
loss
the
heat
emitted
every
second
is
equal
to
that
which
would
result
from
the
combustion
of
eleven
quadrillions
six
hundred
thousand
milliards
of
tons
of
coal
burning
at
once
the
earth
intercepts
only
one
five
hundredth
millionth
part
of
the
radiant
heat
and
this
one
five
hundredth
millionth
suffices
to
maintain
all
terrestrial
life
of
millions
of
light
and
heat
rays
which
the
sun
radiates
into
space
only
one
is
received
and
utilized
by
the
planets
illustration
well
to
maintain
this
source
of
heat
it
is
only
necessary
that
the
rate
of
condensation
should
be
such
that
the
sun
s
diameter
should
decrease
meters
a
year
or
one
kilometer
in
thirteen
years
this
contraction
is
so
gradual
that
it
would
be
wholly
imperceptible
nine
thousand
five
hundred
years
would
be
required
to
reduce
the
diameter
by
one
single
second
of
arc
even
if
the
sun
be
actually
in
a
gaseous
state
its
temperature
so
far
from
growing
less
or
even
remaining
stationary
would
increase
by
the
very
fact
of
contraction
for
if
on
the
one
hand
the
temperature
of
a
gaseous
body
falls
when
it
condenses
on
the
other
hand
the
heat
generated
by
contraction
is
more
than
sufficient
to
prevent
a
fall
in
temperature
and
the
amount
of
heat
increases
until
a
liquid
state
is
reached
the
sun
seems
to
have
reached
this
stage
the
condensation
of
the
sun
whose
density
is
only
that
of
the
earth
may
thus
of
itself
maintain
for
centuries
at
least
for
ten
million
years
the
light
and
heat
of
this
brilliant
star
but
we
have
just
spoken
of
a
second
source
of
heat
the
fall
of
meteorites
one
hundred
and
million
meteorites
fall
upon
the
earth
yearly
a
vastly
greater
number
fall
into
the
sun
because
of
its
greater
attraction
if
their
mass
equals
about
the
one
hundredth
part
of
the
mass
of
the
earth
their
fall
would
suffice
to
maintain
the
temperature
by
their
combustion
for
if
the
sun
itself
was
being
consumed
it
would
not
have
lasted
more
than
six
thousand
years
but
by
the
sudden
transformation
of
the
energy
of
motion
into
heat
the
velocity
of
impact
being
meters
per
second
so
great
is
the
solar
attraction
if
the
earth
should
fall
into
the
sun
it
would
make
good
for
years
the
actual
loss
of
solar
energy
venus
would
make
good
this
loss
for
years
mercury
for
seven
mars
for
thirteen
jupiter
for
saturn
for
uranus
for
and
neptune
for
years
that
is
to
say
the
fall
of
all
the
planets
into
the
sun
would
produce
heat
enough
to
maintain
the
present
rate
of
expenditure
for
about
years
it
is
therefore
certain
that
the
fall
of
meteors
greatly
lengthens
the
life
of
the
sun
one
millionth
of
the
solar
mass
added
each
year
would
compensate
for
the
loss
and
half
of
this
would
be
sufficient
if
we
admit
that
condensation
shares
equally
with
the
fall
of
meteorites
in
the
maintenance
of
solar
heat
centuries
would
have
to
pass
before
any
acceleration
of
the
planets
velocities
would
be
apparent
owing
to
these
two
causes
alone
we
may
therefore
admit
a
future
for
the
sun
of
at
least
twenty
million
years
and
this
period
can
not
but
be
increased
by
other
unknown
causes
to
say
nothing
of
an
encounter
with
a
swarm
of
meteorites
the
sun
therefore
was
the
last
living
member
of
the
system
the
last
animated
by
the
warmth
of
life
but
the
sun
also
went
out
after
having
so
long
poured
upon
his
celestial
children
his
vivifying
beams
the
black
spots
upon
his
surface
increased
in
number
and
in
extent
his
brilliant
photosphere
grew
dull
and
his
hitherto
dazzling
surface
became
congealed
an
enormous
red
ball
took
the
place
of
the
dazzling
center
of
the
vanished
worlds
for
a
long
time
this
enormous
star
maintained
a
high
surface
temperature
and
a
sort
of
phosphorescent
atmosphere
its
virgin
soil
illumined
by
the
light
of
the
stars
and
by
the
electric
influences
which
formed
a
kind
of
atmosphere
gave
birth
to
a
marvelous
flora
to
an
unknown
fauna
to
beings
differing
absolutely
in
organization
from
those
who
had
succeeded
each
other
upon
the
worlds
of
its
system
but
for
the
sun
also
the
end
came
and
the
hour
sounded
on
the
timepiece
of
destiny
when
the
whole
solar
system
was
stricken
from
the
book
of
life
and
one
after
another
the
stars
each
one
of
which
is
a
sun
a
solar
system
shared
the
same
fate
yet
the
universe
continued
to
exist
as
it
does
today
ψ
the
science
of
mathematics
tells
us
the
solar
system
does
not
appear
to
possess
at
present
more
than
the
one
four
hundred
and
part
of
the
transformable
energy
which
it
had
in
the
nebulous
state
although
this
remainder
constitutes
a
fund
whose
magnitude
confounds
our
imagination
it
will
also
some
day
be
exhausted
later
the
transformation
will
be
complete
for
the
entire
universe
resulting
in
a
general
equilibrium
of
temperature
and
pressure
energy
will
not
then
be
susceptible
of
transformation
this
does
not
mean
annihilation
a
word
without
meaning
nor
does
it
mean
the
absence
of
motion
properly
speaking
since
the
same
sum
of
energy
will
always
exist
in
the
form
of
atomic
motion
but
the
absence
of
all
sensible
motion
of
all
differentiation
the
absolute
uniformity
of
conditions
that
is
to
say
absolute
such
is
the
present
statement
of
the
science
of
mathematics
experiment
and
observation
prove
that
on
the
one
hand
the
quantity
of
matter
and
on
the
other
hand
the
quantity
of
energy
also
remains
constant
whatever
the
change
in
form
or
in
position
but
they
also
show
that
the
universe
tends
to
a
state
of
equilibrium
a
condition
in
which
its
heat
will
be
uniformly
distributed
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
of
all
the
stars
seems
to
be
due
to
the
transformation
of
their
initial
energy
of
motion
to
molecular
impacts
the
heat
thus
generated
is
being
constantly
radiated
into
space
and
this
radiation
will
go
on
until
every
sun
is
cooled
down
to
the
temperature
of
space
itself
if
we
admit
that
the
sciences
of
today
mechanics
physics
and
mathematics
are
trustworthy
and
that
the
laws
which
now
control
the
operations
of
nature
and
of
reason
are
permanent
this
must
be
the
fate
of
the
universe
far
from
being
eternal
the
earth
on
which
we
live
has
had
a
beginning
in
eternity
a
hundred
million
years
a
thousand
million
years
or
centuries
are
as
a
day
there
is
an
eternity
behind
us
and
before
us
and
all
apparent
duration
is
but
a
point
a
scientific
investigation
of
nature
and
acquaintance
with
its
laws
raises
therefore
the
question
already
raised
by
the
theologians
whether
plato
zoroaster
saint
augustine
saint
thomas
aquinas
or
some
young
seminarist
who
has
just
taken
orders
what
was
god
doing
before
the
creation
of
the
universe
and
what
will
he
do
after
its
end
or
under
a
less
anthromorphic
form
since
god
is
unknowable
what
was
the
condition
of
the
universe
prior
to
the
present
order
of
things
and
what
will
it
be
after
this
order
has
passed
away
note
that
the
question
is
the
same
whether
we
admit
a
personal
god
reasoning
and
acting
toward
a
definite
end
or
whether
we
deny
the
existence
of
any
spiritual
being
and
admit
only
the
existence
of
indestructible
atoms
and
forces
representing
an
invariable
sum
of
energy
in
the
first
case
why
should
god
an
eternal
and
uncreated
power
remain
inactive
or
having
remained
inactive
satisfied
with
the
absolute
infinity
of
his
nature
which
nothing
could
augment
why
did
he
change
this
state
and
create
matter
and
force
the
theologian
may
reply
because
it
was
his
good
but
philosophy
is
not
satisfied
with
this
change
in
the
divine
purpose
in
the
second
case
since
the
origin
of
the
present
condition
of
things
only
dates
back
a
certain
time
and
since
there
can
be
no
effect
without
a
cause
we
have
the
right
to
ask
what
was
the
condition
of
things
anterior
to
the
formation
of
the
present
universe
although
energy
is
indestructible
we
certainly
can
not
deny
the
tendency
toward
its
universal
dissipation
and
this
must
lead
to
absolute
repose
and
death
for
the
conclusions
of
mathematics
are
irresistible
nevertheless
we
do
not
concede
this
why
because
the
universe
is
not
a
definite
quantity
ω
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
of
a
limit
to
the
extension
of
matter
limitless
space
the
inexhaustible
source
of
the
transformation
of
potential
energy
into
visible
motion
and
thence
into
heat
and
other
forces
confronts
us
and
not
a
simple
finished
piece
of
mechanism
running
like
a
clock
and
stopping
forever
the
future
of
the
universe
is
its
past
if
the
universe
were
to
have
had
an
end
this
end
would
have
been
reached
long
ago
and
we
should
not
be
here
to
study
this
problem
it
is
because
our
conceptions
are
finite
that
things
have
a
beginning
and
an
end
we
can
not
conceive
of
an
absolutely
endless
series
of
transformations
either
in
the
future
or
in
the
past
nor
that
an
equally
endless
series
of
material
combinations
of
planets
suns
milky
ways
stellar
universes
can
succeed
each
other
nevertheless
the
heavens
are
there
to
show
us
the
infinite
nor
can
we
comprehend
any
better
the
infinity
of
space
or
of
time
yet
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
conceive
of
a
limit
to
either
for
our
thought
overleaps
the
limit
and
is
impotent
to
conceive
of
bounds
beyond
which
there
is
no
space
nor
time
one
may
travel
forever
in
any
direction
without
reaching
a
boundary
and
as
soon
as
anyone
affirms
that
at
a
certain
moment
duration
ceases
we
refuse
our
assent
for
we
can
not
confound
time
with
the
human
measures
of
it
these
measures
are
relative
and
arbitrary
but
time
itself
exists
like
space
independently
of
them
suppress
everything
space
and
time
would
still
remain
that
is
to
say
space
which
material
things
may
occupy
and
the
possibility
of
the
succession
of
events
if
this
were
not
so
neither
space
nor
time
would
be
really
measurable
not
even
in
thought
since
thought
would
not
exist
but
it
is
impossible
for
the
mind
even
to
suppress
either
the
one
or
the
other
strictly
speaking
it
is
neither
space
nor
time
that
we
are
speaking
of
but
infinity
and
eternity
relative
to
which
every
measure
however
great
is
but
a
point
we
do
not
comprehend
or
conceive
of
infinite
space
or
time
because
we
are
incapable
of
it
but
this
incapacity
does
not
invalidate
the
existence
of
the
absolute
in
confessing
that
we
do
not
comprehend
infinity
we
feel
it
about
us
and
that
space
as
bounded
by
a
wall
or
any
barrier
whatever
is
in
itself
an
absurd
idea
and
we
are
equally
incapable
of
denying
the
possibility
of
the
existence
at
some
instant
of
time
of
a
system
of
worlds
whose
motions
would
measure
time
without
creating
it
do
our
clocks
create
time
no
they
do
but
measure
it
in
the
presence
of
the
absolute
our
measures
of
both
time
and
space
vanish
but
the
absolute
remains
illustration
we
live
then
in
the
infinite
without
doubting
it
for
an
instant
the
hand
which
holds
this
pen
is
composed
of
eternal
and
indestructible
elements
and
the
atoms
which
constituted
it
existed
in
the
solar
nebula
whence
our
planet
came
and
will
exist
forever
your
lungs
breathe
your
brains
think
with
matter
and
forces
which
acted
millions
of
years
ago
and
will
act
endlessly
and
the
little
globule
which
we
inhabit
floats
not
at
the
center
of
a
limited
universe
but
in
the
depth
of
infinity
as
truly
as
does
the
most
distant
star
which
the
telescope
can
discover
the
best
definition
of
the
universe
ever
given
to
which
there
was
nothing
to
add
is
pascal
s
a
sphere
whose
center
is
everywhere
and
circumference
it
is
this
infinity
which
assures
the
eternity
of
the
universe
stars
systems
myriads
milliards
universes
succeed
each
other
without
end
in
every
direction
we
do
not
live
near
a
center
which
does
not
exist
and
the
earth
like
the
farthest
star
lies
in
the
fathomless
infinite
no
bounds
to
space
fly
in
thought
in
any
direction
with
any
velocity
for
months
years
centuries
forever
we
shall
meet
with
no
limit
approach
no
boundary
we
shall
always
remain
in
the
vestibule
of
the
infinite
before
us
no
bounds
to
time
live
in
imagination
through
future
ages
add
centuries
to
centuries
epoch
to
epoch
we
shall
never
attain
the
end
we
shall
always
remain
in
the
vestibule
of
the
eternity
which
opens
before
us
in
our
little
sphere
of
terrestrial
observation
we
see
that
through
all
the
transformations
of
matter
and
motion
the
same
quantity
of
each
remains
though
under
new
forms
living
beings
afford
a
perpetual
illustration
of
this
they
are
born
they
grow
by
appropriating
substances
from
the
world
without
and
when
they
die
they
break
up
and
restore
to
nature
the
elements
of
which
they
are
composed
but
by
a
law
whose
action
never
ceases
other
bodies
are
constituted
from
these
same
elements
every
star
may
be
likened
to
an
organized
being
even
as
regards
its
internal
heat
a
body
is
alive
so
long
as
respiration
and
the
circulation
of
the
blood
makes
it
possible
for
the
various
organs
to
perform
their
functions
when
equilibrium
and
repose
are
reached
death
follows
but
after
death
all
the
substances
of
which
the
body
was
formed
are
wrought
into
other
beings
dissolution
is
the
prelude
to
recreation
analogy
leads
us
to
believe
that
the
same
is
true
of
the
cosmos
nothing
can
be
destroyed
is
an
incommensurable
power
which
we
are
obliged
to
recognize
as
limitless
in
space
and
without
beginning
or
end
in
time
and
this
power
is
that
which
persists
through
all
the
changes
in
those
sensible
appearances
under
which
the
universe
presents
itself
to
for
this
reason
there
will
always
be
suns
and
worlds
not
like
ours
but
still
suns
and
worlds
succeeding
each
other
through
all
eternity
and
for
us
this
visible
universe
can
only
be
the
changing
of
the
absolute
and
eternal
α
it
is
in
virtue
of
this
transcendent
law
that
long
after
the
death
of
the
earth
of
the
giant
planets
and
the
central
luminary
while
our
old
and
darkened
sun
was
still
speeding
through
boundless
space
with
its
dead
worlds
on
which
terrestrial
and
planetary
life
had
once
engaged
in
the
futile
struggle
for
daily
existence
another
extinct
sun
issuing
from
the
depths
of
infinity
collided
obliquely
with
it
and
brought
it
to
rest
then
in
the
vast
night
of
space
from
the
shock
of
these
two
mighty
bodies
was
suddenly
kindled
a
stupendous
conflagration
and
an
immense
gaseous
nebula
was
formed
which
trembled
for
an
instant
like
a
flaring
flame
and
then
sped
on
into
regions
unknown
its
temperature
was
several
million
degrees
all
which
here
below
had
been
earth
water
air
minerals
plants
atoms
all
which
had
constituted
man
his
flesh
his
palpitating
heart
his
flashing
eye
his
armed
hand
his
thinking
brain
his
entrancing
beauty
the
victor
and
the
vanquished
the
executioner
and
his
victim
and
those
inferior
souls
still
wearing
the
fetters
of
matter
were
changed
into
fire
and
so
with
the
worlds
of
mars
venus
jupiter
saturn
and
the
rest
it
was
the
resurrection
of
visible
nature
but
those
superior
souls
which
had
acquired
immortality
continued
to
live
forever
in
the
hierarchy
of
the
invisible
psychic
universe
the
conscious
existence
of
mankind
had
attained
an
ideal
state
mankind
had
passed
by
transmigration
through
the
worlds
to
a
new
life
with
god
and
freed
from
the
burdens
of
matter
soared
with
an
endless
progress
in
eternal
light
the
immense
gaseous
nebula
which
absorbed
all
former
worlds
thus
transformed
into
vapor
began
to
turn
upon
itself
and
in
the
zones
of
condensation
of
this
primordial
new
worlds
were
born
as
heretofore
the
earth
was
so
another
universe
began
whose
genesis
some
future
moses
and
laplace
would
tell
a
new
creation
superhuman
inexhaustible
resembling
neither
the
earth
nor
mars
nor
saturn
nor
the
sun
and
new
humanities
arose
new
civilizations
new
vanities
another
babylon
another
thebes
another
athens
another
rome
another
paris
new
palaces
temples
glories
and
loves
and
all
these
things
possessed
nothing
of
the
earth
whose
very
memory
had
passed
away
like
a
shadow
and
these
universes
passed
away
in
their
turn
but
infinite
space
remained
peopled
with
worlds
and
stars
and
souls
and
suns
and
time
went
on
forever
for
there
can
be
neither
end
nor
beginning
