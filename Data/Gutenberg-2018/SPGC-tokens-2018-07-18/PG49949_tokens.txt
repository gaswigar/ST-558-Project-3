more
preface
in
preparing
this
logic
of
vegetarianism
for
a
new
edition
i
have
carefully
a
sheaf
of
press
opinions
which
greeted
the
first
appearance
of
the
book
some
seven
years
ago
with
the
hope
of
profiting
by
any
adverse
criticism
which
might
point
out
arguments
that
i
had
overlooked
in
this
however
i
have
been
disappointed
for
apart
from
a
few
such
objections
as
that
raised
in
all
seriousness
by
the
i
had
not
done
justice
to
the
great
problem
of
what
would
become
of
the
only
definite
complaint
which
i
can
find
is
that
the
representatives
of
whom
i
have
introduced
in
the
dialogues
are
deliberately
made
to
talk
nonsense
it
is
easy
said
one
critic
to
confute
an
opponent
if
you
have
the
selection
of
the
arguments
and
the
framing
of
the
replies
i
ought
not
perhaps
to
have
expected
that
the
assurance
given
in
my
introductory
chapter
as
to
the
authenticity
of
the
pleadings
would
shield
me
from
this
charge
indeed
the
in
a
friendly
review
of
the
book
expressed
doubt
as
to
the
policy
of
using
dialogue
at
all
because
as
it
remarked
the
arguments
against
vegetarianism
are
often
so
silly
that
it
looks
as
if
the
author
had
set
up
a
man
of
straw
in
order
to
demolish
him
yet
as
the
itself
added
there
is
not
an
argument
against
vegetarianism
quoted
in
this
volume
which
we
have
not
time
after
time
seen
seriously
brought
forward
by
our
opponents
surely
it
would
be
a
strange
thing
if
food
reformers
had
to
avoid
any
terse
presentment
of
their
adversaries
reasoning
for
the
very
fact
of
its
imbecility
and
there
is
this
further
question
if
i
have
failed
to
include
in
my
selection
the
effective
arguments
against
vegetarianism
where
and
what
are
they
looking
through
those
cited
in
the
press
notices
i
can
discover
none
that
seem
to
be
formidable
but
rather
than
again
be
suspected
of
unfair
suppression
let
me
frankly
quote
the
following
specimens
of
the
philosophy
the
proof
that
man
should
eat
meat
is
that
he
always
has
done
so
does
now
and
always
will
and
again
nobody
will
want
to
make
out
that
he
the
advocate
of
vegetarianism
is
wrong
but
folk
will
just
go
on
suiting
themselves
as
before
shelley
and
thoreau
wagner
and
edward
fitzgerald
were
vegetarians
but
then
wellington
and
gladstone
partook
of
the
roast
beef
of
old
england
and
were
none
the
worse
there
is
a
sublime
simplicity
about
these
statements
which
is
most
impressive
but
i
can
not
think
that
any
wrong
is
done
to
the
case
against
vegetarianism
by
not
including
them
in
a
discussion
which
purports
to
be
a
logical
one

of

introductory
it
is
the
special
purpose
of
this
book
to
set
forth
in
a
clear
and
rational
manner
the
logic
of
vegetarianism
to
the
ethical
the
scientific
and
the
economic
aspects
of
the
system
much
attention
has
already
been
given
by
writers
but
there
has
not
as
yet
been
any
organised
effort
to
present
the
is
the
dialectical
scope
of
the
arguments
offensive
and
defensive
on
which
the
case
for
vegetarianism
is
founded
i
am
aware
that
mere
logic
is
not
in
itself
a
matter
of
importance
and
that
a
great
humane
principal
based
on
true
natural
instinct
will
in
the
have
fulfilment
whatever
wordy
battles
may
rage
around
it
for
a
time
nevertheless
there
is
no
better
method
of
hastening
that
result
than
to
set
the
issues
before
the
public
in
a
plain
and
unmistakable
light
i
wish
therefore
in
this
work
to
show
what
vegetarianism
is
and
a
scarcely
less
essential
point
what
vegetarianism
is
for
though
owing
to
the
propaganda
carried
on
for
the
last
fifty
years
there
has
been
an
increasing
talk
of
vegetarianism
and
a
considerable
discussion
of
its
doctrines
there
are
still
very
numerous
misunderstandings
of
its
real
aims
and
meaning
in
this
as
in
other
phases
of
the
great
progressive
movement
of
which
vegetarianism
is
a
part
to
give
expression
to
a
new
idea
is
to
excite
a
host
of
blind
and
angry
prejudices
the
champions
of
the
old
are
too
disdainful
to
take
counsel
with
the
champions
of
the
new
hence
they
commonly
attribute
to
them
designs
quite
different
from
those
which
they
really
entertain
and
unconsciously
set
up
a
straw
man
for
the
pleasure
of
pummelling
him
with
criticism
devoid
always
of
a
sense
of
sympathy
and
mostly
of
a
sense
of
humour
they
absurdly
exaggerate
the
least
vital
points
in
their
adversaries
reasoning
while
they
often
fail
to
note
what
is
the
very
core
of
the
controversy
it
is
therefore
of
great
concern
to
vegetarianism
that
its
case
should
be
so
stated
as
to
preclude
all
possibility
of
doubt
as
to
the
real
issues
involved
if
agreement
is
beyond
our
reach
let
us
at
least
ascertain
the
precise
point
of
our
disagreement
with
a
view
to
this
result
it
will
be
convenient
to
have
recourse
now
and
then
to
the
form
of
dialogue
so
as
to
bring
into
sharper
contrast
the
and
of
the
argument
nor
will
these
conversations
be
altogether
imaginary
for
to
avoid
any
suspicion
of
burlesquing
the
of
our
opponents
by
a
fanciful
presentment
i
shall
introduce
only
such
objections
to
vegetarianism
as
have
actually
been
insisted
in
fact
which
crop
up
again
and
again
in
all
colloquies
on
food
sometimes
the
very
words
of
the
disputant
it
is
not
my
fault
if
some
of
these
objections
appear
to
be
foolish
i
have
often
marvelled
at
the
reckless
way
in
which
those
who
would
combat
new
and
unfamiliar
notions
step
forth
to
the
encounter
unprovided
with
intellectual
safeguards
and
trusting
wholly
to
certain
ancient
generic
fallacies
which
if
we
may
judge
from
their
appearance
in
all
ages
and
climates
are
indigenous
in
the
human
mind
many
of
the
difficulties
which
the
propounds
to
the
vegetarian
are
the
same
as
those
which
have
at
various
times
been
cast
in
the
teeth
of
the
reformer
by
the
apologists
of
every
cruel
and
iniquitous
custom
from
to
the
suttee
to
show
the
unreality
of
these
sophisms
by
clearing
away
the
misconceptions
upon
which
they
rest
and
to
state
the
creed
of
vegetarianism
as
preached
and
practised
by
its
friends
rather
than
as
misapprehended
by
its
is
the
object
of
this
work
to
make
conversions
in
the
ordinary
sense
is
not
my
concern
what
we
have
to
do
is
to
discover
who
are
by
ingrained
conviction
and
who
by
thoughtlessness
and
ignorance
and
to
bring
over
to
our
side
from
the
latter
class
those
who
are
naturally
allied
to
us
though
by
accident
ranged
in
opposition
and
this
once
more
can
only
be
done
by
making
the
issues
unmistakable
incidentally
i
hope
these
pages
may
suggest
to
our
antagonists
that
vegetarians
perhaps
are
not
the
weak
brainless
sentimentalists
that
they
are
so
often
depicted
it
is
to
say
the
least
of
it
entertaining
when
a
critic
who
has
just
been
inquiring
for
example
what
would
become
of
the
animals
if
mankind
were
to
desist
from
eating
them
goes
on
to
remark
of
vegetarians
that
their
hearts
are
better
than
their
heads
alas
we
can
not
truthfully
return
the
compliment
by
saying
of
such
a
philosopher
that
his
head
is
better
than
his
heart
it
can
not
be
too
strongly
stated
that
the
appeal
of
vegetarianism
as
of
all
humane
systems
is
not
to
heart
alone
nor
to
brain
alone
but
to
brain
and
heart
combined
and
that
if
its
claims
fail
to
win
this
double
judgment
they
are
necessarily
void
and
invalid
the
test
of
logic
no
less
than
the
test
of
feeling
is
deliberately
challenged
by
us
for
it
is
only
by
those
who
can
think
as
well
as
feel
and
feel
as
well
as
think
that
the
diet
question
or
indeed
any
great
social
question
can
ever
be
brought
to
its
solution
why
vegetarian
the
term
vegetarian
as
applied
to
those
who
abstain
from
all
flesh
food
but
not
necessarily
from
such
animal
products
as
eggs
milk
and
cheese
appears
to
have
come
into
existence
over
fifty
years
ago
at
the
time
of
the
founding
of
the
vegetarian
society
in
until
that
date
no
special
name
had
been
appropriated
for
the
reformed
diet
system
which
was
usually
known
as
the
pythagorean
or
vegetable
diet
as
may
be
seen
by
a
reference
to
the
writings
of
that
period
presumably
it
was
felt
that
when
the
movement
grew
in
volume
and
was
about
to
enter
on
a
new
phase
with
an
organised
propaganda
it
was
advisable
to
coin
for
it
an
original
and
distinctive
title
whether
from
this
point
of
view
the
name
vegetarian
was
wisely
or
unwisely
chosen
is
a
question
on
which
there
has
been
some
difference
of
opinion
among
food
reformers
themselves
and
it
is
possible
that
adverse
criticism
would
have
been
still
more
strongly
expressed
but
for
the
fact
that
no
better
title
has
been
forthcoming
on
the
whole
the
name
vegetarian
seems
to
be
fairly
serviceable
its
disadvantage
being
that
it
gives
occasion
for
sophistry
on
the
part
of
captious
opponents
in
all
controversies
such
as
that
of
which
vegetarianism
is
the
subject
there
are
verbalists
who
can
not
see
beyond
the
outer
shell
of
a
word
to
the
thing
which
the
word
signifies
and
who
delight
to
chop
logic
and
raise
small
obstacles
as
thus
verbalist
why
vegetarian
vegetarian
why
not
vegetarian
verbalist
how
can
it
be
consistent
with
vegetarianism
to
consume
as
you
admit
you
do
milk
butter
cheese
and
eggs
all
of
which
are
choice
foods
from
the
animal
kingdom
vegetarian
that
entirely
depends
on
what
is
meant
by
vegetarianism
verbalist
well
surely
its
meaning
is
diet
of
vegetables
only
with
no
particle
of
animal
substance
vegetarian
as
a
matter
of
fact
such
is
not
and
has
never
been
its
accepted
meaning
the
question
was
often
debated
in
the
early
years
of
the
vegetarian
society
and
it
was
always
held
that
the
use
of
eggs
and
milk
was
prohibited
to
induce
habits
of
abstinence
from
the
flesh
of
animals
fish
flesh
fowl
as
food
was
the
avowed
aim
of
vegetarianism
as
officially
stated
on
the
of
its
journal
verbalist
but
the
word
vegetarian
other
meaning
can
it
have
than
that
which
i
have
attributed
to
it
vegetarian
presumably
those
who
invented
the
word
were
the
best
judges
of
its
meaning
and
what
they
meant
by
it
is
proved
beyond
a
doubt
by
the
usage
of
the
society
verbalist
but
had
they
a
right
thus
to
twist
the
word
from
its
natural
derivation
vegetarian
if
you
appeal
to
etymology
that
raises
another
question
altogether
and
here
too
you
will
find
the
authorities
against
you
no
one
has
a
better
right
to
speak
on
this
matter
than
professor
b
mayor
the
great
latin
scholar
and
he
states
that
looking
at
the
word
etymologically
vegetarian
can
not
mean
an
eater
of
vegetables
it
is
derived
from
vigorous
and
means
strictly
interpreted
one
who
aims
at
vigour
mind
i
am
not
saying
that
the
originators
of
the
term
vegetarian
had
this
meaning
in
view
but
merely
that
the
etymological
sense
of
the
word
does
not
favour
your
contention
any
more
than
the
historical
verbalist
well
what
vegetarian
mean
then
how
do
you
explain
it
yourself
vegetarian
a
vegetarian
is
one
who
abstains
from
eating
the
flesh
of
animals
and
whose
food
is
derived
from
the
vegetable
kingdom
the
above
dialogue
will
show
the
absurdity
and
injustice
of
charging
vegetarians
as
the
late
sir
henry
thompson
did
with
equivocal
terms
short
untruthfulness
because
they
retain
a
title
which
was
originally
invented
for
their
case
the
statement
that
vegetarians
have
the
meaning
of
their
name
owing
to
inability
to
find
adequate
nourishment
on
purely
vegetable
diet
is
founded
on
similar
ignorance
of
the
facts
here
are
two
specimens
of
sir
henry
thompson
inaccuracy
in
he
wrote
it
is
high
time
that
we
should
be
spared
the
obscure
language
or
rather
the
inaccurate
statement
to
which
milk
and
egg
consumers
are
committed
in
assuming
a
title
which
has
for
centuries
belonged
to
that
not
inconsiderable
body
of
persons
whose
habits
of
life
confer
the
right
to
use
it
footnote
may
observe
that
sir
henry
thompson
was
then
under
the
impression
that
the
name
vegetarian
invented
in
was
centuries
old
nor
names
apart
was
he
any
more
accurate
as
regards
the
practice
itself
for
it
can
be
proved
on
the
authority
of
a
long
succession
of
writers
from
the
time
of
ovid
to
the
time
of
shelley
that
the
use
of
milk
and
its
products
has
been
from
the
first
regarded
as
compatible
with
the
pythagorean
or
vegetable
diet
the
fact
that
some
individual
abstainers
from
flesh
have
also
abstained
from
all
animal
substances
is
no
justification
of
the
attempt
to
impose
such
stricter
abstinence
on
all
vegetarians
on
peril
of
being
deprived
of
their
name
thirteen
years
later
sir
henry
thompson
argument
was
entirely
changed
his
assertion
of
the
of
the
name
vegetarian
was
quietly
dropped
in
fact
its
was
now
rather
insisted
on
they
the
vegetarians
emphatically
state
that
they
no
longer
rely
for
their
diet
on
the
produce
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
differing
from
those
who
originally
adopted
the
name
at
a
date
by
no
means
remote
footnote
june
but
our
critic
was
again
absolutely
mistaken
there
is
no
difference
whatever
between
the
diet
of
those
who
adopted
the
name
at
the
date
by
no
means
remote
and
that
of
those
who
bear
it
now
now
as
then
there
are
some
few
vegetarians
who
abjure
all
that
is
of
the
animal
but
the
rule
of
the
society
now
as
then
is
that
the
use
of
eggs
and
milk
is
permissible
at
the
third
annual
meeting
held
in
it
was
stated
by
one
of
the
speakers
that
the
limits
within
which
the
dietary
of
the
vegetarian
society
was
restricted
excluded
nothing
but
the
flesh
and
blood
of
animals
to
avoid
any
possible
misunderstanding
let
me
repeat
that
it
is
no
part
of
the
case
for
vegetarianism
to
defend
the
vegetarian
in
itself
it
may
be
a
good
name
or
a
bad
one
what
we
defend
is
our
right
to
the
title
an
indefeasible
historical
claim
which
is
not
to
be
upset
by
any
such
unfounded
and
assertions
as
those
quoted
but
it
may
be
said
that
even
if
the
title
is
historically
genuine
it
would
be
better
to
change
it
as
it
evidently
leads
to
misunderstanding
we
should
be
perfectly
willing
to
do
this
but
for
two
difficulties
first
that
no
other
satisfactory
title
has
ever
been
suggested
and
secondly
that
as
the
word
vegetarian
has
now
a
recognised
place
in
the
language
it
would
scarcely
be
possible
to
get
rid
of
it
at
any
rate
the
substitute
to
have
the
least
chance
of
success
would
have
to
be
very
terse
popular
and
expressive
take
for
example
the
name
or
akreophagist
proposed
by
sir
henry
thompson
the
obvious
objection
to
such
terms
is
that
they
are
merely
and
give
the
notion
that
we
are
abstinents
and
nothing
more
we
do
not
at
all
object
to
the
use
of
the
term
as
explanatory
of
vegetarian
but
we
do
object
to
it
as
a
substitute
for
as
such
it
would
give
undue
prominence
to
our
disuse
of
flesh
food
which
after
all
is
merely
one
particular
result
of
a
general
habit
of
mind
let
us
state
it
in
this
way
our
view
of
life
is
such
that
is
abhorrent
and
impossible
to
us
but
the
mere
fact
that
this
abstinence
attracts
the
special
attention
of
and
becomes
the
immediate
subject
of
controversy
does
not
make
it
the
sum
and
substance
of
our
creed
we
hold
that
in
a
rational
and
humanised
society
there
could
be
no
question
at
all
about
such
a
practice
as
the
very
idea
of
it
would
be
insufferable
therefore
we
object
to
be
labelled
with
a
negative
term
which
only
marks
our
divergence
from
other
persons
diet
we
prefer
something
that
is
positive
and
indicative
of
our
own
and
until
we
find
some
more
appropriate
title
we
intend
to
make
the
best
of
what
we
have
got
the
whole
why
argument
is
in
fact
a
disingenuous
one
the
practical
issue
between
vegetarians
and
has
always
been
perfectly
clear
to
those
who
wished
to
understand
it
and
the
attempt
made
by
the
verbalists
to
distract
attention
from
the
in
order
to
fasten
it
on
the
is
nothing
but
sophistical
of
this
main
practical
issue
and
of
the
further
distinction
between
the
vegetarian
or
diet
and
the
purely
vegetable
diet
i
will
speak
in
the
following
chapter
the
of
vegetarianism
behind
the
mere
name
of
the
reformed
diet
whatever
name
be
employed
and
as
we
have
seen
vegetarian
at
present
holds
the
field
lies
the
far
more
important
reality
what
is
the
the
real
purport
of
vegetarianism
certainly
not
any
assumption
that
all
animal
substances
as
such
are
unfit
for
human
food
for
though
it
is
quite
probable
that
the
movement
will
ultimately
lead
us
to
the
disuse
of
animal
products
vegetarianism
is
not
primarily
based
on
any
such
formula
but
on
the
conviction
suggested
in
the
first
place
by
instinctive
feeling
but
confirmed
by
reason
and
experience
that
there
are
certain
grave
evils
inseparable
from
the
practice
of
the
aversion
to
flesh
food
is
not
chemical
but
moral
social
hygienic
believing
as
we
do
that
the
grosser
forms
of
diet
not
only
cause
a
vast
amount
of
unnecessary
suffering
to
the
animals
but
also
react
most
injuriously
on
the
health
and
morals
of
mankind
we
advocate
their
gradual
discontinuance
and
so
long
as
this
protest
is
successfully
launched
the
mere
name
by
which
it
is
called
is
a
matter
of
minor
concern
but
here
on
this
practical
issue
as
before
on
the
nominal
issue
we
come
into
conflict
with
the
superior
person
who
with
a
smile
of
supercilious
compassion
can
not
see
we
poor
ascetics
should
thus
afflict
ourselves
without
cause
superior
person
but
why
my
dear
should
you
refuse
a
slice
of
roast
beef
what
is
the
difference
between
roasting
an
ox
and
boiling
an
egg
in
the
latter
case
you
are
eating
an
animal
in
is
all
vegetarian
do
you
not
draw
any
distinction
between
the
lower
and
the
higher
organisation
superior
person
none
whatever
they
are
chemically
identical
in
substance
vegetarian
possibly
but
we
were
talking
not
of
chemistry
but
of
morals
and
an
egg
is
certainly
not
morally
identical
with
an
ox
superior
person
how
or
where
does
the
moral
phase
of
enter
the
science
of
dietetics
vegetarian
at
a
good
many
points
i
think
one
of
them
is
the
question
of
cannibalism
allow
me
to
read
you
a
passage
from
the
encyclopædia
britannica
man
being
by
nature
carnivorous
as
well
as
frugivorous
and
human
flesh
being
not
unfit
for
human
food
the
question
arises
why
mankind
generally
have
not
only
avoided
it
but
have
looked
with
horror
on
exceptional
individuals
and
races
addicted
to
cannibalism
it
is
evident
on
consideration
that
both
emotional
and
religious
motives
must
have
contributed
to
bring
about
this
prevailing
state
of
mind
superior
person
of
course
why
read
me
all
that
vegetarian
to
show
you
that
what
you
call
the
moral
phase
of
has
undoubtedly
affected
our
diet
the
very
thought
of
eating
human
flesh
is
revolting
to
you
yet
human
flesh
is
chemically
identical
with
animal
flesh
and
if
it
be
true
that
to
boil
an
egg
is
the
same
thing
as
to
roast
an
ox
it
follows
that
to
butcher
an
ox
is
the
same
thing
as
to
murder
a
man
such
is
the
logical
position
in
which
you
have
placed
yourself
by
ignoring
the
fact
that
all
life
is
not
valuable
but
that
the
higher
the
life
the
greater
the
responsibility
incurred
by
those
who
destroy
it
or
it
may
be
that
the
superior
person
instead
of
denying
that
morals
affect
dietetics
himself
poses
as
so
austere
a
moralist
as
to
scorn
the
wretched
of
merely
abstaining
from
flesh
food
while
still
using
animal
products
the
result
is
in
either
case
the
same
the
argument
is
sometimes
put
forward
in
this
fashion
superior
person
well
as
far
as
the
right
or
wrong
of
the
question
is
concerned
i
would
not
care
to
be
a
vegetarian
at
all
unless
i
were
a
thorough
one
what
can
be
the
good
of
forswearing
animal
food
in
one
form
if
you
take
it
in
another
vegetarian
but
surely
it
is
rational
to
deal
with
the
worst
abuses
first
to
insist
on
an
policy
would
be
fatal
to
any
reform
whatsoever
improvements
never
come
in
the
mass
but
always
by
instalment
and
it
is
only
reactionists
who
deny
that
half
a
loaf
is
better
than
no
bread
superior
person
but
in
this
case
i
understand
that
it
is
quite
possible
to
be
consistent
there
are
individuals
are
there
not
who
live
upon
a
purely
vegetable
diet
without
using
milk
or
eggs
now
those
are
the
people
whose
action
one
can
at
least
appreciate
and
respect
vegetarian
quite
so
we
fully
admit
that
they
are
in
advance
of
their
fellows
we
regard
them
as
pioneers
who
are
now
anticipating
a
future
phase
of
our
movement
superior
person
you
admit
then
that
this
extreme
vegetarianism
is
the
more
ideal
diet
vegetarian
yes
to
do
more
than
you
have
undertaken
to
do
is
a
mark
of
signal
merit
but
no
discredit
attaches
on
that
account
to
those
who
have
done
what
they
undertook
we
hold
that
the
first
step
as
tolstoy
has
expressed
it
is
to
clear
one
self
of
all
complicity
in
the
horrible
business
of
the
superior
person
well
i
must
repeat
that
were
i
to
practise
any
form
of
asceticism
i
should
incline
to
that
which
does
not
do
things
by
halves
vegetarian
of
course
that
is
invariably
the
sentiment
of
those
who
do
not
do
things
at
all
asceticism
such
is
the
strange
idea
with
which
in
many
minds
our
principles
are
associated
it
would
be
impossible
to
take
a
more
erroneous
view
of
modern
vegetarianism
and
it
is
only
through
constitutional
or
deliberate
blindness
to
the
meaning
of
the
movement
that
such
a
misconception
can
arise
how
can
we
convey
to
our
friends
in
polite
yet
sufficiently
forcible
language
that
their
diet
is
an
abomination
to
us
and
that
our
abstinence
far
from
being
ascetic
is
much
more
nearly
allied
to
the
joy
that
never
palls
is
the
farmer
an
ascetic
because
looking
over
into
his
pigsty
he
has
no
inclination
to
swill
himself
from
the
same
trough
as
the
swine
and
why
then
should
it
be
counted
asceticism
on
our
part
to
refuse
on
precisely
the
same
grounds
to
eat
the
swine
themselves
no
our
opponents
must
clearly
recognise
if
they
wish
to
form
any
correct
notion
of
vegetarianism
that
it
is
based
not
on
asceticism
but
æstheticism
not
on
the
mortification
but
the
gratification
of
the
higher
pleasures
we
conclude
then
that
the
cause
which
vegetarians
have
at
heart
is
the
outcome
not
of
some
barren
academic
formula
but
of
a
practical
reasoned
conviction
that
flesh
food
especially
butchers
meat
is
a
harmful
and
barbarous
diet
into
the
details
of
this
belief
we
need
not
at
present
enter
it
has
been
sufficient
here
to
show
that
such
belief
exists
and
that
the
good
people
who
can
see
in
vegetarianism
nothing
but
a
whimsical
fad
have
altogether
failed
to
grasp
its
true
purport
and
significance
the
of
vegetarianism
is
the
growing
sense
that
is
a
cruel
disgusting
unwholesome
and
wasteful
practice
and
that
it
behoves
humane
and
rational
persons
disregarding
the
common
cant
about
consistency
and
to
reform
their
diet
to
what
extent
and
with
what
speed
they
can
the
past
and
present
of
vegetarianism
but
it
may
be
said
before
entering
on
a
consideration
of
this
reformed
diet
for
which
such
great
merits
are
claimed
by
its
exponents
the
practical
man
is
justified
in
asking
for
certain
solid
assurances
since
busy
people
can
not
be
expected
to
give
their
time
to
speculations
which
however
beautiful
in
themselves
may
prove
at
the
end
to
be
in
conflict
with
the
hard
facts
of
life
and
the
first
of
these
questions
is
what
is
the
historic
basis
of
vegetarianism
in
what
sense
is
it
an
old
movement
and
in
what
sense
a
new
one
has
it
a
past
which
may
serve
in
some
measure
to
explain
its
present
and
guarantee
its
future
such
questions
have
been
dealt
with
fully
from
time
to
time
in
vegetarian
literature
i
can
here
do
no
more
than
epitomise
the
answers
vegetarianism
regarded
simply
as
a
practice
and
without
relation
to
any
principle
is
of
immemorial
date
it
was
in
fact
as
physiology
shows
us
the
original
diet
of
mankind
while
as
history
shows
us
it
has
always
been
the
diet
of
the
many
as
flesh
food
has
been
the
diet
of
the
few
and
even
to
this
day
it
is
the
main
support
of
the
greater
part
of
the
world
inhabitants
numberless
instances
might
be
quoted
in
proof
of
these
assertions
it
is
sufficient
to
refer
to
the
people
of
india
china
and
japan
the
egyptian
fellah
the
bedouin
arab
the
peasantry
of
russia
and
turkey
the
labourers
and
miners
of
chili
and
other
south
american
states
and
to
come
nearer
home
the
great
bulk
of
the
country
folk
in
western
europe
and
great
britain
the
peasant
here
and
all
the
world
over
has
been
and
still
is
in
the
main
a
vegetarian
and
must
for
the
most
part
continue
so
and
the
fact
that
this
diet
has
been
the
result
not
of
choice
but
of
necessity
does
not
lessen
the
significance
of
its
perfect
sufficiency
to
maintain
those
who
do
the
hard
work
of
the
world
side
by
side
with
the
tendency
of
the
wealthier
classes
to
indulge
more
and
more
in
flesh
food
has
been
the
undisputed
admission
that
for
the
workers
such
luxuries
were
unneeded
footnote
as
in
the
perfect
way
in
diet
by
anna
kingsford
and
strength
and
diet
by
the
hon
russell
during
the
last
however
as
we
all
know
the
unhealthy
and
crowded
civilisation
of
great
industrial
centres
has
produced
among
the
urban
populations
of
europe
a
craving
for
flesh
food
which
has
resulted
in
their
being
fed
largely
on
cheap
butchers
meat
and
offal
while
there
has
grown
up
a
corresponding
belief
that
we
must
look
almost
entirely
to
a
flesh
diet
for
bodily
and
mental
vigour
it
is
in
protest
against
this
comparatively
new
demand
for
flesh
as
a
necessity
of
life
that
vegetarianism
as
a
modern
organised
movement
has
arisen
secondly
if
we
look
back
for
examples
of
deliberate
abstinence
from
is
of
vegetarianism
practised
as
a
before
it
was
denoted
by
a
find
no
lack
of
them
in
the
history
of
religious
and
moral
systems
and
individual
lives
such
abstinence
was
an
essential
feature
in
the
teaching
of
buddha
and
pythagoras
and
is
still
practised
in
the
east
on
religious
and
ceremonial
grounds
by
brahmins
and
buddhists
it
was
inculcated
in
the
humanitarian
writings
of
great
pagan
philosophers
such
as
plutarch
and
porphyry
whose
ethical
precepts
as
far
as
the
treatment
of
the
lower
animals
is
concerned
are
still
far
in
advance
of
modern
christian
sentiment
again
in
the
prescribed
regimen
of
certain
religious
orders
such
as
benedictines
trappists
and
carthusians
we
have
further
unquestionable
evidence
of
the
disuse
of
flesh
food
though
in
such
cases
the
reason
for
the
abstinence
is
ascetic
rather
than
humane
when
we
turn
to
the
biographies
of
individuals
we
learn
that
there
have
been
numerous
examples
of
what
is
now
called
vegetarianism
always
consistent
indeed
or
continuous
in
practice
yet
sufficiently
so
to
prove
the
entire
possibility
of
the
diet
and
to
remove
it
from
the
category
of
generous
aspiration
into
that
of
accomplished
fact
footnote
see
the
list
of
names
cited
in

of

a
biographical
history
of
the
literature
of
humane
dietetics
from
the
earliest
period
to
the
present
day
but
granting
that
there
is
historic
basis
for
the
vegetarian
system
the
question
is
asked
whether
on
ethnological
evidence
it
does
not
appear
that
the
dominant
races
have
been
for
the
most
part
carnivorous
and
the
subject
races
line
of
argument
which
always
appeals
strongly
to
the
patriotic
briton
patriot
come
now
it
is
all
very
well
to
talk
of
philosophers
and
poets
and
i
have
no
doubt
you
can
point
to
such
names
among
the
founders
of
your
creed
but
what
i
ask
is
were
the
founders
of
the
british
empire
vegetarians
were
any
great
empires
ever
founded
by
vegetarians
was
julius
cæsar
a
vegetarian
was
wellington
a
vegetarian
can
you
give
me
any
instance
of
vegetarianism
as
a
fighting
force
vegetarian
as
regards
the
rank
and
file
of
conquering
armies
there
are
many
such
instances
both
in
ancient
and
modern
history
the
diet
of
the
roman
soldier
was
not
that
of
a
and
the
roman
empire
was
assuredly
not
won
by
virtue
of
but
by
the
hardihood
which
could
subsist
on
simple
rations
of
wheat
oil
and
wine
so
too
the
armies
which
built
up
the
earlier
empires
of
egypt
and
assyria
were
for
the
most
part
vegetarian
that
is
to
say
while
the
rulers
and
wealthy
classes
of
fighting
nations
have
been
carnivorous
the
bulk
of
the
soldiery
drawn
from
the
frugal
peasant
class
has
been
unaccustomed
to
such
luxuries
the
idea
that
the
races
have
everywhere
subjugated
the
vegetarians
is
quite
illusory
patriot
but
surely
in
india
the
mohammedan
has
always
conquered
the
vegetarian
hindu
vegetarian
not
by
any
means
always
it
took
him
centuries
of
fierce
fighting
to
do
so
with
all
the
advantages
of
religious
fanaticism
on
his
side
as
against
an
enemy
weakened
by
internal
dissension
and
an
enervating
climate
but
that
mohammedanism
does
not
depend
on
flesh
food
for
its
fighting
qualities
may
be
seen
from
the
case
of
that
special
ally
and
favourite
of
yours
the
turk
let
me
read
you
what
the
said
of
him
some
twenty
years
back
from
the
day
of
his
irruption
into
europe
the
turk
has
always
proved
himself
to
be
endowed
with
singularly
strong
vitality
and
energy
as
a
member
of
a
warlike
race
he
is
without
equal
in
europe
in
health
and
hardiness
he
can
live
and
fight
when
soldiers
of
any
other
nationality
would
starve
his
excellent
physique
his
simple
habits
his
abstinence
from
intoxicating
liquors
and
his
normal
vegetarian
diet
enable
him
to
support
the
greatest
hardships
and
to
subsist
on
the
scantiest
and
simplest
food
have
i
said
enough
to
show
you
that
vegetarianism
be
a
fighting
force
it
will
be
objected
perhaps
that
when
food
reformers
claim
these
fighting
qualities
for
their
diet
they
are
proving
just
a
little
too
much
for
their
principles
as
for
example
in
the
reference
to
the
sanguinary
turk
as
a
practical
vegetarian
if
the
outcome
of
vegetarian
diet
is
to
be
war
and
massacre
how
is
the
system
any
better
than
that
which
it
fain
would
supersede
this
brings
us
back
to
the
of
the
present
chapter
the
distinction
between
what
may
be
called
the
old
and
the
new
vegetarianism
we
have
seen
that
so
far
as
the
common
practice
is
concerned
abstinence
from
flesh
food
is
as
old
as
history
itself
and
that
rarer
instances
may
be
cited
of
practice
and
principle
combined
but
when
we
regard
vegetarianism
as
a
propagandist
movement
a
conscious
endeavour
to
benefit
not
merely
the
individual
man
but
human
society
itself
we
have
to
recognise
that
it
is
a
movement
from
a
mere
habit
of
the
many
or
piety
of
the
few
it
has
become
a
reasoned
principle
an
organised
system
with
a
name
and
nomenclature
of
its
own
in
vulgar
language
it
is
an
and
like
other
kindred
a
part
of
the
great
humanitarian
impulse
of
the
past
hundred
years
the
significance
of
this
distinction
is
considerable
modern
vegetarianism
is
the
same
yet
not
the
same
as
the
flesh
abstinence
that
dates
from
earlier
same
in
so
far
as
the
actual
dietary
is
concerned
and
in
some
fewer
cases
the
same
in
principle
but
different
altogether
in
the
spirit
by
which
that
principle
is
informed
and
for
this
reason
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
judge
vegetarianism
as
a
whole
by
the
character
of
those
races
who
happen
to
have
been
abstainers
from
flesh
and
who
are
merely
quoted
as
proving
the
physical
sufficiency
of
the
diet
in
a
word
ethnical
vegetarianism
and
ethical
vegetarianism
are
two
very
different
things
it
has
also
to
be
remembered
that
the
modern
vegetarian
appeals
not
to
humane
instinct
only
but
to
physiological
facts
and
that
the
movement
has
now
become
to
a
very
large
extent
a
scientific
and
hygienic
one
thus
again
differing
widely
from
the
merely
empirical
and
unconscious
vegetarianism
of
earlier
times
these
several
aspects
of
the
system
will
be
reviewed
in
succeeding
chapters
it
is
enough
here
to
repeat
that
vegetarianism
as
a
practice
is
immemorial
as
a
precept
is
of
great
antiquity
but
as
an
organised
cult
is
one
of
the
new
revolutionary
forces
of
modern
times
structural
evidence
we
have
seen
then
that
vegetarianism
though
new
as
a
propagandist
doctrine
has
its
historical
record
but
if
we
wish
thoroughly
to
understand
its
origin
we
must
go
back
beyond
history
to
the
more
ancient
and
more
durable
evidence
of
the
organic
structure
of
man
here
we
come
in
conflict
with
what
is
perhaps
the
strangest
of
the
many
strange
prejudices
that
oppose
the
humane
superstition
so
common
among
the
uneducated
and
connived
at
if
not
shared
by
some
of
the
scientific
themselves
that
the
verdict
of
comparative
anatomy
is
fatal
to
the
vegetarian
claims
so
far
is
this
from
being
the
case
that
the
great
naturalists
from
linnæus
onward
give
implicit
judgment
to
the
contrary
by
classing
mankind
with
the
frugivorous
family
of
the
anthropoid
apes
thus
sir
richard
owen
says
the
apes
and
monkeys
which
man
most
nearly
resembles
in
his
dentition
derive
their
staple
food
from
fruits
grain
the
kernels
of
nuts
and
other
forms
in
which
the
most
sapid
and
nutritious
tissues
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
are
elaborated
and
the
close
resemblance
between
the
quadrumanous
and
the
human
dentition
shows
that
man
was
from
the
beginning
more
especially
adapted
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
trees
of
the
garden
footnote
odontography
chap
this
sentence
is
quoted
only
for
what
it
is
as
proving
that
in
owen
opinion
man
was
originally
frugivorous
if
the
whole
passage
in
odontography
be
studied
it
will
be
seen
that
owen
can
not
fairly
be
cited
as
a
vegetarian
authority
because
after
alluding
to
the
fact
that
the
apes
occasionally
eat
insects
eggs
and
young
birds
he
sums
up
in
favour
of
what
he
calls
the
frugivorous
and
mixed
regimen
of
the
quadrumana
and
man
this
point
i
have
dealt
with
later
in
the
chapter
and
here
is
the
more
recent
verdict
of
sir
benjamin
richardson
on
the
whole
i
am
bound
to
give
judgment
on
the
evidence
of
the
teeth
rather
in
favour
of
the
vegetarian
argument
it
seems
fairest
of
fair
to
read
from
nature
that
the
teeth
of
man
were
fitted
if
the
word
destined
is
objected
a
plant
or
vegetable
diet
and
that
the
modification
due
to
animal
food
by
which
some
change
has
been
made
is
practically
an
accident
or
necessity
which
would
soon
be
rectified
if
the
conditions
were
rendered
favourable
to
a
return
to
the
primitive
state
by
weighing
the
facts
that
now
lie
before
us
the
inference
is
justified
that
in
spite
of
the
very
long
time
during
which
man
has
been
subjected
to
an
animal
diet
he
retains
in
preponderance
his
original
and
natural
taste
for
an
innocent
diet
derived
from
the
of
the
earth
footnote
foods
for
man
yet
in
spite
of
such
testimony
and
more
of
an
equally
authoritative
kind
it
is
quite
a
common
thing
for
some
scientist
to
allege
against
vegetarianism
the
conformation
of
the
human
teeth
or
stomach
scientist
but
our
teeth
my
good
friend
our
teeth
what
can
be
the
use
of
your
talking
about
vegetarianism
when
we
both
of
us
carry
in
our
mouths
a
proof
of
the
necessity
of
vegetarian
but
surely
you
do
not
hold
the
popular
fallacy
that
man
canine
teeth
class
him
among
the
carnivora
scientist
they
prove
at
least
that
he
is
an
eater
of
flesh
as
well
as
of
vegetables
why
else
has
he
got
such
teeth
vegetarian
why
has
a
gorilla
got
such
teeth
for
the
purpose
of
combat
and
defence
owen
tells
us
not
of
food
and
if
a
gorilla
with
canines
much
more
developed
than
man
is
a
frugivorous
animal
why
must
man
with
less
developed
canines
be
carnivorous
scientist
well
well
let
us
turn
to
the
digestive
organs
then
look
at
the
immense
difference
between
the
human
stomach
and
that
of
the
true
herbivora
how
can
mankind
get
the
required
nutriment
from
herbs
when
we
have
not
the
necessary
apparatus
for
doing
so
vegetarian
but
it
has
never
been
argued
by
us
nor
is
it
in
any
way
essential
to
our
argument
that
mankind
is
what
have
the
herbivora
to
do
with
the
question
scientist
i
have
seen
them
quoted
in
your
books
as
instances
of
strength
and
vegetarian
to
dispel
the
illusion
that
there
is
no
chemical
nutriment
in
anything
but
flesh
food
but
that
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
asserting
that
man
is
himself
herbivorous
the
point
at
issue
is
simple
you
charge
vegetarians
with
flying
in
the
face
of
nature
we
show
you
from
your
own
authorities
that
the
structural
evidence
whatever
that
may
be
worth
it
was
you
who
first
appealed
to
it
pronounces
man
to
have
been
originally
neither
carnivorous
nor
herbivorous
but
if
you
think
otherwise
what
do
you
make
of
the
apes
the
close
similarity
that
exists
between
the
structure
of
man
and
that
of
the
anthropoid
apes
is
the
hard
fact
that
can
not
be
evaded
by
the
apologists
of
in
the
conformation
alike
of
brain
of
hands
of
teeth
of
salivary
glands
of
stomach
we
have
indisputable
proof
of
the
frugivorous
origin
of
it
is
not
seriously
questioned
by
any
recognised
authority
that
man
was
a
in
the
early
stages
of
his
development
as
far
as
comparative
anatomy
throws
light
on
the
diet
question
mankind
and
the
apes
are
so
to
speak
in
the
same
box
and
he
who
would
disprove
the
frugivorous
nature
of
man
must
also
disprove
the
frugivorous
nature
of
the
anthropoid
apes
a
predicament
of
which
the
more
intelligent
of
our
opponents
are
keenly
aware
and
this
brings
us
to
the
second
branch
of
the
subject
of
this
chapter
whatever
his
original
structure
it
is
argued
man
has
extended
his
resources
in
the
matter
of
food
and
has
long
been
omnivorous
while
his
middle
position
between
the
carnivora
and
herbivora
indicates
that
he
is
naturally
suited
for
a
mixed
diet
it
will
be
noted
is
the
blessed
word
that
is
to
bring
comfort
to
and
the
inconvenient
apes
whom
the
naturalists
class
as
frugivorous
have
somehow
to
be
dragged
in
under
the
category
of
omnivorous
but
first
a
word
about
the
meaning
of
this
saving
term
now
i
wish
to
make
it
plain
that
vegetarians
are
not
wedded
to
any
theory
that
the
lines
of
dietetic
development
are
stringently
limited
by
the
original
structure
of
man
if
the
appeals
as
he
so
often
does
to
physical
structure
with
the
intent
of
attributing
carnivorous
instincts
to
mankind
we
confront
him
with
an
array
of
scientific
opinion
which
quickly
makes
him
wish
he
had
let
the
subject
alone
and
if
he
insists
on
the
evolutional
rather
than
the
natural
aspect
of
the
problem
we
are
equally
ready
to
meet
him
on
this
newer
ground
but
we
decline
to
fall
victims
to
the
rather
disingenuous
quibble
that
lurks
in
the
specious
application
to
mankind
of
the
term
omnivorous
for
what
in
the
present
connection
does
the
word
omnivorous
mean
it
can
not
obviously
mean
that
man
should
like
the
hog
eat
for
if
so
it
would
sanction
not
only
but
cannibalism
and
we
should
have
to
class
mankind
so
professor
mayor
has
wittily
remarked
as
it
must
mean
presumably
that
man
is
fitted
to
eat
not
but
food
or
animal
that
he
is
eclectic
in
his
diet
free
to
choose
what
is
good
and
reject
what
is
bad
without
being
bound
by
any
original
law
of
nature
to
the
name
omnivorous
used
not
in
the
hoggish
sense
but
in
this
rational
sense
and
not
excluding
as
the
scientists
would
absurdly
make
it
exclude
the
force
of
and
other
considerations
the
vegetarian
need
raise
no
objection
man
is
omnivorous
is
he
he
may
select
his
own
diet
from
the
vegetable
and
animal
kingdoms
well
and
good
that
is
just
what
we
have
always
advised
him
to
do
and
we
are
prepared
to
give
reasons
moral
and
hygienic
why
in
making
the
selection
he
should
omit
the
use
not
of
all
animal
products
but
of
flesh
the
scientists
can
not
have
it
ways
they
can
not
dogmatise
on
diet
as
a
thing
settled
by
comparative
anatomy
and
assert
that
man
is
omnivorous
free
to
choose
what
is
best
footnote
it
has
been
well
shown
by
oldfield
in
the
century
october
that
omnivorism
in
the
hoggish
sense
is
characteristic
of
progressive
mankind
the
higher
we
go
in
the
scale
of
life
the
more
we
find
taking
the
place
of
omnivorism
the
more
complex
the
organism
the
greater
its
selective
capacity
then
rather
than
should
be
the
of
the
human
race
evolving
upward
but
let
us
return
to
our
monkeys
scientist
you
just
now
quoted
the
gorilla
as
a
frugivorous
animal
but
on
further
consideration
i
can
not
admit
him
to
be
so
he
is
man
i
have
sir
richard
owen
authority
for
it
vegetarian
what
does
the
ape
rush
upon
the
antelopes
and
rend
them
with
those
canine
teeth
of
his
how
horrible
scientist
not
exactly
that
but
it
was
stated
by
sir
henry
thompson
that
sally
the
large
chimpanzee
once
so
popular
in
the
zoological
gardens
was
not
infrequently
supplied
with
animal
food
vegetarian
well
and
how
does
that
prove
that
the
chimpanzee
is
not
naturally
frugivorous
i
should
imagine
that
any
one
of
us
if
placed
in
a
cage
and
stared
at
all
the
year
round
by
a
throng
of
gaping
visitors
might
be
liable
to
aberrations
even
a
vegetarian
might
do
the
same
scientist
but
in
their
wild
state
also
the
baboons
are
known
to
prey
on
lizards
young
birds
eggs
when
they
can
get
them
perhaps
you
were
not
aware
of
this
when
you
called
the
apes
frugivorous
vegetarian
i
was
quite
aware
of
it
and
in
view
of
the
exceedingly
small
importance
of
these
casual
pilferings
as
compared
with
their
staple
diet
i
maintain
that
they
for
all
practical
purposes
frugivorous
indeed
so
far
from
this
mischievous
penchant
of
the
apes
being
an
argument
against
vegetarianism
it
is
most
suggestive
as
explaining
how
the
early
savages
may
have
passed
almost
by
accident
at
first
from
a
frugivorous
to
a
mixed
diet
scientist
well
at
any
rate
it
indicates
that
apes
have
a
tendency
to
become
omnivorous
vegetarian
yes
if
you
like
to
express
it
so
and
it
is
still
more
evident
that
men
have
that
tendency
but
the
question
is
whether
the
tendency
is
rightly
interpreted
as
giving
a
sanction
to
for
as
we
use
the
term
means
the
breeding
destroying
and
devouring
of
mammals
and
is
a
very
different
thing
from
the
egg
and
lizard
hunting
in
which
the
monkeys
sometimes
indulge
if
you
would
confine
your
to
a
few
insects
and
nestlings
you
would
have
a
better
right
to
quote
the
example
of
the
apes
has
been
a
necessary
step
in
man
progress
without
access
to
the
it
has
been
asked
would
not
the
race
have
remained
in
the
groves
with
the
orangs
and
the
gorillas
i
do
not
see
that
vegetarians
need
concern
themselves
to
answer
such
speculations
which
interesting
though
they
are
do
not
bear
closely
on
the
present
issue
for
though
as
we
have
seen
the
testimony
of
the
past
is
in
favour
of
a
frugivorous
origin
the
problem
of
the
present
is
one
which
we
are
free
to
solve
without
prejudice
and
whether
the
past
use
of
flesh
food
by
a
portion
of
the
world
inhabitants
has
helped
or
hindered
the
true
development
of
man
is
a
matter
for
individual
judgment
we
may
have
our
own
opinion
about
it
but
what
we
are
concerned
to
prove
is
that
can
offer
no
advantages
to
us
the
appeal
to
nature
of
the
many
dense
prejudices
through
which
as
through
a
snowdrift
vegetarianism
has
to
plough
its
way
before
it
can
emerge
into
the
field
of
free
discussion
there
is
none
perhaps
more
inveterate
than
the
common
appeal
to
nature
a
typical
instance
of
the
remarkable
misuse
of
logic
which
characterises
such
argument
may
be
seen
in
the
anecdote
related
by
benjamin
franklin
in
his
autobiography
of
the
incident
which
induced
him
to
return
after
years
of
abstinence
to
a
flesh
diet
he
was
watching
some
companions
and
observing
that
some
of
the
fish
caught
by
them
had
swallowed
other
fish
he
concluded
that
if
you
eat
one
another
i
do
see
why
we
may
not
eat
you
confusion
of
ichthyology
and
morals
which
is
ludicrous
enough
as
narrated
by
franklin
but
not
essentially
more
foolish
than
the
attempt
so
frequently
made
by
to
shuffle
their
personal
responsibility
on
to
some
supposed
natural
law
but
let
the
carnivorous
anthropologist
speak
for
himself
anthropologist
now
understand
me
i
think
this
vegetarianism
is
well
enough
as
a
sentiment
i
fully
appreciate
your
aspiration
but
you
have
overlooked
the
fact
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
laws
of
nature
it
is
beautiful
in
theory
but
impossible
in
practice
vegetarian
indeed
that
puts
me
in
an
awkward
position
as
i
have
been
practising
it
for
twenty
years
anthropologist
it
is
not
the
individual
that
i
am
speaking
of
but
the
race
a
man
may
practise
it
perhaps
but
mankind
can
not
do
so
with

why

because
as

it
is

do
you
dare
to
impugn

not
at
all
what
i
dare
to
impugn
is
your
incorrect
description

there
is
a

more

what

is
it
not

no
that
is
just
what
it
is
not
there
are
principles
at

in

and
the
law

there
are
carnivorous
animals
and
predatory
races
and

races
and
the
vital
question
which
does

belong
you
obscure
the
issue
by
these
vague
and
meaningless
appeals
to
the
laws
of
nature
when
in
the
first
place
you
are
quoting
only
part
of

ordinance
and
secondly
have
not
yourself
the

intention
of
conforming
even
to
that
part

beg
your
pardon

good

my

i
must
entreat
vegetarian
exactly
you
are
horrified
at
the
mere
mention
of
such
things
yet
these
habits
are
as
easily
justified
as
if
you
take
nature
as
your
model
without
specifying
nature
the
nature
of
the
conger
and
the
or
the
nature
of
civilised
man
pray
tell
me
anthropologist
and
then
our
conversation
may
not
be
wholly
irrelevant
the
idea
that
the
darwinian
doctrine
of
the
struggle
of
life
justifies
any
barbarous
treatment
of
inferior
races
is
ridiculed
by
so
distinguished
an
authority
as
prince
kropotkin
who
points
out
that
darwin
does
teach
this
he
proves
that
there
is
a
struggle
for
existence
in
order
to
put
a
check
on
the
inordinate
increase
of
species
but
this
struggle
is
not
to
be
understood
in
a
crude
and
exclusive
sense
there
is
a
law
of
competition
but
there
is
is
still
more
law
of
mutual
aid
and
as
soon
as
the
scientist
leaves
his
laboratory
and
comes
out
into
the
open
woods
and
meadows
he
sees
the
importance
of
this
law
only
those
animals
who
are
mutually
helpful
are
really
fitted
to
survive
it
is
not
the
strong
but
the
species
that
endure
so
too
with
reference
to
the
strange
notion
that
a
guide
for
human
conduct
may
be
deduced
from
some
particular
animal
instinct
taken
at
haphazard
from
its
surroundings
a
timely
warning
is
addressed
to
such
crude
reasoners
by
professor
arthur
thomson
what
we
must
protest
against
is
that
interpretation
according
to
which
individualistic
competition
is
nature
sole
method
of
progress
the
precise
nature
of
the
means
employed
and
ends
attained

considered

that

as
has
often

out
it
is
only
by
delegating
to
others
the
detested
work
of
slaughter

by
employing
cookery
to
conceal
the
uncongenial
truth
that
thoughtful
persons
can
tolerate

practice

we
have
not

the
appeal

we
have
still
to
speak
of
the
common
objection
to
vegetarianism
that
it
is
necessary
to
take

anthropologist
i
have
a
most
important
argument
to
put
before
you
must
you
not
face
the
fact
that
in
this
imperfect
world
it
is
necessary
to
take
life
how
can
it
be
immoral
to
do
what
necessity
imposes
vegetarian
we
do
not
say
that
it
is
immoral
to
take
life
but
that
it
is
immoral
to
take
life
it
is
not
immoral
for
instance
to
destroy
rats
and
mice
because
it
is
necessary
to
do
so
it
immoral
to
kill
animals
for
the
table
because
it
is
necessary
to
do
so
did
you
ever
tread
on
a
beetle
anthropologist
yes
by
accident
i
could
not
help
it
i
am
a
most
humane
man
vegetarian
of
course
but
supposing
that
you
wished
to
murder
someone
would
you
think
yourself
justified
in
doing
so
because
you
had
trodden
on
in
fact
sometimes
it
is
necessary
to
take
life
anthropologist
certainly
not
how
can
you
suspect
me
of
being
so
immoral
there
is
a
great
difference
between
taking
the
life
of
a
beetle
by
accident
and
of
a
man
by
design
there
are
of
responsibility
you
know
vegetarian
ah
you
have
got
your
answer
then
how
is
it
we
wonder
that
rational
beings
can
commit
themselves
to
such
irrational
arguments
as
this
appeal
to
what
is
called
nature
but
is
in
reality
only
an
isolated
section
of
nature
viewed
apart
from
the
rest
let
benjamin
franklin
himself
supply
the
answer
for
in
narrating
that
incident
of
the
to
which
i
have
alluded
he
humorously
hints
that
his
philosophical
conclusion
if
you
eat
one
another
i
do
see
why
we
may
not
eat
you
was
not
uninfluenced
by
the
fact
that
he
had
been
a
great
lover
of
fish
in
early
life
and
that
the
fish
smelt
admirably
well
as
it
came
out
of
the
and
he
sagely
adds
that
one
of
the
advantages
to
man
of
being
a
reasonable
creature
is
that
he
can
find
or
make
a
reason
for
anything
he
has
a
mind
to
do
such
is
the
logic
of
the
in
which
the
wish
is
father
to
the
thought
and
mixed
thinking
leads
by
a
convenient
process
to
a
mixed

the
humanitarian
argument
it
will
have
been
noted
that
the
arguments
which
have
so
far
come
under
review
have
been
mainly
such
as
are
based
on
purely
grounds
as
if
the
question
were
wholly
one
for
doctors
and
scientists
to
decide
and
it
has
been
shown
that
even
thus
there
is
no
sort
of
warrant
for
the
supercilious
dismissal
of
vegetarianism
as
a
theory
condemned
in
advance
by
some
superior
tribunal
but
the
question
is
not
one
for
the
of
the
specialist
it
is
also
a
moral
question
of
very
great
moment
and
this
fact
gives
a
new
significance
to
such
unwilling
admissions
as
that
made
by
the
medical
that
man
can
obtain
from
vegetables
the
nutriment
necessary
for
his
maintenance
in
health
from
vegetables
only
much
more
therefore
from
a
vegetable
diet
with
the
addition
of
eggs
and
milk
the
practicability
of
vegetarianism
being
thus
fully
granted
it
is
impossible
to
pretend
that
moral
considerations
are
not
relevant
to
the
controversy
and
that
in
forming
an
opinion
on
the
vexed
problem
of
diet
we
should
not
give
due
weight
to
the
promptings
of
humaneness
people
often
talk
as
if
the
humanitarian
plea
were
some
fanciful
external
sentiment
that
has
been
illogically
thrust
into
the
discussion
whereas
in
truth
it
is
one
of
the
innermost
facts
of
the
situation
which
no
sophistry
can
escape
our

unalterably

almost
to
hear
of
any
man

even
any
animal
whatever
in

now
that
modern
science
has
demonstrated
the
close
kinship
that
exists
between
human
and

greater
is
the
repulsion

we

receive

was
repeatedly
asserted
by

are
brutally
harsh

is
the
treatment
that
in
many
cases
when

are

the

as

testify
simply
falls
off

there
is
a
mass
of
printed
testimony
to
the

effect
which
can
be
confirmed
as
often
as
confirmation
is
needed
by
a

much
also
might
be
said
of
certain
special
cruelties
such
as
those
involved
in
the
supply
of
white
veal
or
de
foie
and
other
delicacies
but
it
is
unnecessary
to
dwell
on
such
refinements
of
torture
because
it
is
the
ordinary
aspects
of
that
are
here
under
debate
it
is
a
terrible
fact
that
the
very
prevalence
of
the
habit
serves
more
than
anything
else
to
conceal
its
full
import
and
thus
a
large
number
of
people
who
in
any
other
department
of
life
would
indignantly
refuse
to
profit
by
the
cruel
usage
of
animals
are
without
knowing
or
at
least
without
recognising
it
dependent
for
their
daily
food
on
the
continued
and
systematic
infliction
of
sufferings
which
in
their
magnitude
and
frequency
surpass
all
other
cruelties
whatsoever
of
which
animals
are
the
victims
these
horrors
as
i
have
said
are
not
realised
by
those
who
are
personally
responsible
for
them
or
rather
they
are
not
realised
for
indirectly
it
is
evident
enough
that
the
more
sensitive
conscience
of
mankind
is
far
from
easy
about
the
morality
of
butchering
and
would
show
still
greater
uneasiness
but
for
the
quieting
assurance
that
flesh
food
is
a
strict
necessity
of
existence
this
sense
of
compunction
has
found
at
least
partial
expression
in
many
works
as
for
example
in
michelet
bible
of
humanity
the
daily
murder
which
feeding
upon
animals
hard
and
bitter
problems
sternly
placed
themselves
before
my
mind
miserable
contradiction
let
us
hope
that
there
may
be
another
globe
in
which
the
base
the
cruel
fatalities
of
this
one
may
be
spared
to
us
now
in
view
of
these
facts
and
these
feelings
we
have
a
right
to
press
the
advocates
of
for
some
more
explicit
and
coherent
statement
than
they
have
hitherto
accorded
us
of
their
attitude
towards
the
ethics
of
the
diet
question
if
as
the
scientists
themselves
admit
there
is
no
such
cruel
fatality
as
that
which
michelet
pictured
and
if
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
necessary
but
only
as
expedient
then
it
is
in
the
highest
degree
unreasonable
to
rule
out
considerations
from
their
due
share
in
the
settlement
of
this
problem
the
medical
has
said
that
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
that
the
use
of
animals
for
food
involves
a
vast
amount
of
pain
the
same
paper
has
said
that
man
can
obtain
from
vegetables
the
nutriment
necessary
for
his
maintenance
in
health
can
it
be
doubted
that
if
the
average
englishman
were
made
aware
of
these
two
facts
he
would
at
least
think
vegetarianism
worthy
of
a
serious
trial
to
ask
as
a
superior
person
of
science
has
asked
not
merely
in
these
dialogues
but
in
actual
debate
how
or
where
does
the
moral
phase
of
enter
the
science
of
dietetics
or
to
take
refuge
in
the
common
saying
that
one
man
food
is
another
man
poison
is
simply
irrelevant
for
diet
like
other
social
questions
has
its
moral
aspect
which
claims
no
less
and
no
more
than
its
due
importance
and
it
is
because
the
scientific
antagonists
of
vegetarianism
have
overlooked
this
fact
that
their
judgments
have
hitherto
been
so
warped
illogical
and
unscientific
palliations
and
sophistries
it
is
instructive
to
note
the
desperate
shifts
and
subterfuges
to
which
our
antagonists
have
recourse
when
they
find
themselves
face
to
face
with
the
humanitarian
impeachment
of
the
if
of
the
popular
prejudices
were
true
it
might
be
supposed
that
in
the
discussion
of
so
fanciful
and
utopian
a
theory
as
vegetarianism
it
would
be
its
supporters
who
would
take
refuge
in
metaphysical
quibblings
and
sophistries
while
its
opponents
would
hold
sternly
to
the
hard
facts
of
life
but
no
for
when
butchery
is
the
theme
we
find
the
exact
opposite
to
be
the
case
and
it
is
the
those
deriders
of
the
sentimental
who
suddenly
became
enamoured
of
the
imaginary
and
the
hypothetical
and
are
disposed
to
turn
their
attention
to
anything
rather
than
to
the
unpalatable
now
when
the
apologists
of
any
form
of
cruelty
are
reduced
to
the
plea
that
it
is
no
worse
than
some
barbarous
habit
the
presumption
is
that
they
are
in
a
very
bad
plight
indeed
yet
we
frequently
hear
it
said
that
the
fate
of
animals
slaughtered
for
the
table
is
no
worse
than
that
of
other
perhaps
that
are
used
for
purposes
of
draught
or
quite
pointless
comparison
because
even
if
the
statement
be
true
the
one
act
of
injustice
can
obviously
be
no
excuse
for
the
other
or
it
may
be
that
the
mortality
of
man
himself
and
his
liability
to
disease
and
accident
are
alleged
in
mysterious
justification
of
his
carnivorous
habits
the
suffering
of
the
animals
being
represented
as
brief
and
momentary
in
contrast
with
the
pathetic
human
argument
which
reached
its
culminating
point
in
stead
delightful
assertion
that
of
all
kinds
of
death
he
would
himself
prefer
the
mode
in
which
pigs
are
killed
at
chicago
which
mode
as
he
incautiously
let
out
he
did
go
to
see
when
he
visited
that
city
i
do
not
think
we
need
further
discuss
such
remarkable
preference
it
will
be
time
enough
to
do
so
when
we
hear
of
stead
lamented
in
the
chicago
but
it
is
said
that
domesticated
animals
owe
a
deep
debt
of
gratitude
to
mankind
only
to
be
repaid
in
the
form
of
beef
and
mutton
because
by
being
brought
within
the
peaceful
fold
of
civilisation
they
have
been
spared
all
the
harrowing
fears
and
anxieties
of
their
wild
natural
life
this
however
is
a
fallacy
to
which
the
great
naturalists
give
no
sort
of
sanction
for
it
is
obvious
that
though
the
life
of
a
wild
animal
is
liable
to
more
sudden
perils
than
that
of
our
tame
livestock
it
is
not
on
that
account
a
less
happy
one
but
on
the
contrary
is
spent
throughout
in
a
manner
more
conducive
to
the
highest
health
and
happiness
thus
alfred
russel
wallace
says
the
poet
picture
of
nature
red
in
tooth
and
claw
is
a
picture
the
evil
of
which
is
read
into
it
by
our
imagination
the
reality
being
made
up
of
full
and
happy
lives
usually
terminated
by
the
quickest
and
least
painful
of
deaths
and
hudson
i
take
it
that
in
the
lower
animals
misery
can
result
from
two
causes
and
that
animals
in
a
state
of
nature
are
not
miserable
they
are
not
hindered
or
held
back
as
to
disease
it
is
so
rare
in
wild
animals
or
in
a
large
majority
of
cases
so
quickly
proves
fatal
that
compared
with
what
we
call
disease
in
our
own
species
it
is
practically
the
for
existence
in
so
far
as
animals
in
a
state
of
nature
are
concerned
is
a
metaphorical
struggle
and
the
strife
short
and
sharp
which
is
so
common
in
nature
is
not
misery
although
it
results
in
pain
since
it
is
pain
that
kills
or
is
soon
let
us
proceed
then
to
the
great
sophistical
paradox
that
it
is
better
for
the
animals
themselves
to
be
bred
and
slaughtered
than
not
to
be
bred
at
most
comfortable
doctrine
which
of
late
years
has
been
a
veritable
city
of
refuge
or
grand
old
umbrella
to
the
conscientious
under
stress
of
the
vegetarian
bombardment
hither
flock
the
members
of
the
learned
professions
academies
and
ethical
societies
and
fortify
their
souls
anew
with
this
subtle
metaphysic
of
the
larder
sophist
of
all
the
arguments
for
vegetarianism
none
in
my
opinion
is
so
weak
as
the
argument
from
humanity
the
pig
has
a
stronger
interest
than
anyone
in
the
demand
for
bacon
vegetarian
indeed
and
is
that
the
view
the
pig
himself
takes
of
it
sophist
it
is
the
view
take
of
it
speaking
in
the
interests
of
the
pig
for
where
would
the
pig
be
if
we
did
not
eat
pork
he
would
be
he
would
be
no
pig
at
all
vegetarian
and
would
he
be
any
the
for
that
sophist
yes
for
he
would
lose
the
joy
of
life
and
not
the
pig
alone
but
all
animals
that
are
bred
for
human
food
their
death
is
the
little
price
they
necessarily
pay
for
the
inestimable
boon
of
existence
vegetarian
now
let
me
first
point
out
to
you
that
it
is
not
only
that
would
be
justified
by
this
argument
vivisection
slavery
cannibalism
any
treatment
whatsoever
of
animals
or
of
mankind
where
they
are
specially
bred
for
the
purpose
might
be
similarly
shown
to
be
a
kindness
do
you
really
mean
that
sophist
i
assume
of
course
that
the
life
is
a
happy
one
and
the
death
as
painless
as
possible
vegetarian
neither
of
which
conditions
is
in
reality
fulfilled
for
the
wretched
creatures
that
are
bred
and
fed
for
the
shambles
have
none
of
the
true
joys
of
life
but
from
the
first
are
mere
animated
beef
pork
and
mutton
while
their
death
is
nothing
better
than
a
prolonged
and
clumsy
massacre
sophist
but
it
need
not
be
so
it
is
a
mere
question
of
police
and
proper
supervision
it
should
be
imperative
on
all
those
who
confer
life
on
animals
to
ensure
absolute
painlessness
for
the
last
moment
vegetarian
it
be
so
it
seems
that
this
remarkable
kindness
of
yours
is
by
your
own
showing
not
an
actual
but
a
hypothetical
benefit
the
animals
fulfil
their
part
of
the
compact
by
being
killed
and
eaten
and
you
fulfil
your
part
by
killing
them
you
are
you
serious
in
talking
this
stuff
sophist
this
stuff
let
me
remind
you
sir
that
i
have
the
authority
of
such
eminent
philosophers
as
sir
henry
thompson
leslie
stephen
professor
ritchie
and
stanton
coit
do
you
call
their
academical
reasoning
stuff
vegetarian
what
else
can
it
be
called
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
quite
apart
from
the
conditions
good
or
bad
under
which
the
animals
live
and
die
it
is
a
pure
fallacy
to
say
that
it
is
a
to
bring
them
into
existence
sophist
how
so
if
life
is
pleasant
vegetarian
because
it
is
impossible
to
compare
existence
with
existence
may
or
may
not
be
pleasant
but
is
neither
pleasant
nor
is
nothing
at
all
it
can
not
therefore
be
an
to
be
born
though
when
once
you
born
the
good
and
the
evil
are
comparable
the
whole
question
is
a
not
a
prenatal
one
it
begins
at
birth
sophist
well
but
supposing
you
were
an
animal
would
you
not
vegetarian
oh
that
is
a
very
old
question
you
will
find
it
all
in
hansard
it
was
asked
by
sir
herbert
maxwell
when
he
defended
the
sport
of
in
the
debates
of
he
wanted
to
ask
the
hon
member
whether
if
he
were
a
he
would
rather
accept
life
under
the
condition
of
his
life
being
a
short
and
happy
one
and
violently
terminated
or
whether
he
would
reject
life
at
all
upon
such
terms
sophist
hear
hear
that
is
just
what
i
say
vegetarian
then
you
had
better
think
over
forster
reply
which
puts
the
case
in
a
he
said
that
sir
herbert
maxwell
made
one
very
amusing
appeal
by
asking
him
the
member
who
introduced
the
bill
to
put
himself
in
the
position
of
a
but
this
would
be
difficult
for
the
position
was
not
a
in
existence
but
a
before
it
was
born
whereat
the
house
laughed
and
sophistry
was
for
the
moment
disconcerted
but
for
the
moment
only
for
there
have
since
sprung
up
many
other
professors
of
this
metaphysic
of
the
larder
though
none
of
them
with
the
exception
of
stanton
coit
have
had
the
hardihood
to
expound
their
theory
in
wise
reticence
perhaps
when
it
is
seen
how
coit
fared
in
his
conscientious
but
humourless
essay
on
the
bringing
of
sentient
beings
into
existence
if
the
motive
he
opined
that
might
produce
the
greatest
number
of
the
happiest
cattle
would
be
the
eating
of
beef
then
so
far
must
be
commended
and
while
heretofore
the
motive
has
not
been
for
the
sake
of
cattle
it
is
conceivable
that
if
vegetarian
convictions
should
spread
much
further
love
for
cattle
would
if
it
be
not
psychologically
incompatible
blend
with
the
love
of
beef
in
the
minds
of
the
opponents
of
vegetarianism
with
deeper
insight
new
and
higher
motives
may
replace
or
supplement
old
ones
and
perpetuate
but
ennoble
ancient
practices

may

of

but
we
frankly
admit
continues
coit
that
it
is
a
question
whether
the
love
of
cattle
intensified
to
the
imaginative
point
of
individual
affection
for
each
separate
beast
would
not
destroy
the
pleasure
of
eating
beef
and

custom

and
then
coit
goes
on
to
express
a
fear
that
mankind
if
they
adopted
vegetarianism
might
become
less
powerful
in
thought
i
respectfully
submit
that
in
view
of
the
arguments
quoted
there
is
not
the
smallest
possibility
of
the
plea
that
animals
might
be
killed
painlessly
is
a
very
common
one
with
but
it
must
be
pointed
out
that
can
afford
no
exemption
from
moral
responsibility
for
by
all
means
let
us
reform
the
system
of
butchery
as
far
as
it
can
be
is
by
the
total
abolition
of
those
foul
dens
of
torture
known
as
private
and
by
the
substitution
of
municipal
abattoirs
equipped
with
the
best
modern
appliances
and
under
efficient
supervision
for
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
sum
of
animal
suffering
may
thus
be
greatly
lessened
there
will
be
no
opposition
from
the
vegetarian
side
to
such
reform
as
this
indeed
it
is
in
a
large
measure
through
the
personal
efforts
of
vegetarians
that
the
subject
has
attracted
attention
whereas
the
very
people
who
make
this
prospective
improvement
an
excuse
for
their
present
flesh
diet
are
seldom
observed
to
be
doing
anything
practical
to
carry
it
into
effect
but
when
all
is
said
and
done
it
remains
true
that
the
reform
of
the
is
at
best
a
palliative
a
temporary
measure
which
will
mitigate
but
can
not
possibly
amend
the
horrors
of
butchery
for
it
is
but
too
evident
that
under
our
complex
civilisation
when
the
town
is
so
far
aloof
from
the
country
and
pastoralism
can
only
be
carried
on
in
districts
remote
from
the
busy
crowded
centres
it
is
impossible
to
transport
and
slaughter
vast
numbers
of
large
and
animals
in
a
really
humane
manner
more
barbarous
or
less
barbarous
such
slaughtering
may
undoubtedly
be
according
to
the
methods
employed
but
the
humane
slaughtering
so
much
bepraised
of
the
sophist
is
an
impossibility
in
fact
and
a
contradiction
in
terms
the
consistency
trick
it
is
certain
then
that
the
practice
of
involves
a
vast
amount
of
fact
which
can
not
be
lessened
or
evaded
by
any
quibbling
subterfuges
but
before
we
pass
on
to
another
phase
of
the
food
question
we
must
deal
more
fully
with
that
very
common
method
of
argument
alluded
to
in
an
earlier
chapter
which
may
be
called
the
consistency
to
that
known
in
common
parlance
as
the
or
another
device
of
setting
up
an
arbitrary
standard
of
consistency
and
then
demonstrating
that
the
vegetarian
himself
judged
by
that
standard
is
as
inconsistent
as
other
persons
whether
we
plead
guilty
or
not
guilty
to
this
ingenious
indictment
depends
altogether
on
the
meaning
assigned
to
the
term
consistency
for
as
anyone
who
tries
to
do
practical
work
in
the
world
will
rapidly
discover
there
is
a
true
and
there
is
a
false
ideal
of
consistency
to
pretend
that
in
our
complex
modern
society
where
responsibilities
are
so
closely
interwoven
it
is
possible
for
any
individual
to
cultivate
a
perfect
character
and
stand
like
a
sir
galahad
above
his
is
the
false
ideal
of
consistency
which
it
is
the
first
business
of
a
genuine
reformer
to
put
aside
for
no
human
being
can
do
any
solid
work
without
frequently
convicting
himself
of
inconsistencies
when
consistency
is
stereotyped
into
a
formula
on
the
other
hand
there
is
a
true
duty
of
consistency
which
regards
the
spirit
rather
than
the
letter
and
prompts
us
not
to
grasp
foolishly
at
the
ideal
like
a
child
crying
for
the
moon
but
to
push
steadily
the
ideal
by
a
faithful
adherence
to
the
right
line
of
reform
and
by
ever
keeping
in
view
the
just
proportion
and
relative
value
of
all
moral
actions
let
it
be
remembered
that
it
is
this
latter
consistency
alone
that
has
any
interest
for
the
vegetarian
his
purpose
is
not
to
exhibit
himself
as
a
spotless
sir
galahad
of
food
reformers
but
to
take
certain
practical
steps
towards
the
humanising
of
our
barbarous
diet
system
herein
will
be
found
the
answer
to
a
class
of
questions
frequently
put
to
vegetarians
as
to
how
they
find
it
consistent
with
their
principles
to
use
this
or
that
form
of
food
or
animal
substance
it
depends
entirely
on
what
their
principles
are
if
their
aspirations
were
of
the
sir
galahad
order
some
of
the
posers
would
indeed
be
formidable
but
as
they
do
aim
at
moral
perfection
but
merely
at
rational
progress
the
charge
of
inconsistency
hurtles
somewhat
harmlessly
over
their
heads
but
here
let
the
consistency
man
have
his
say
consistency
man
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
you
can
think
it
consistent
to
use
milk
and
eggs
vegetarian
consistent
with
what
consistency
man
why
with
your
own
principles
of
course
vegetarian
or
do
you
mean
with
your
idea
of
my
principles
the
two
things
are
not
always
identical
you
know
consistency
man
you
condemn
because
of
the
suffering
it
causes
but
it
seems
to
have
escaped
your
notice
that
the
use
of
milk
and
eggs
is
also
responsible
for
much
it
is
strange
that
it
has
never
occurred
to
vegetarian
my
good
sir
it
has
occurred
to
us
years
and
years
ago
the
question
is
as
old
as
the
movement
itself
the
argument
i
presume
consistency
man
i
ask
what
would
become
of
the
cockerels
and
under
a
vegetarian
at
present
your
supply
of
milk
and
eggs
is
easy
enough
because
the
young
males
are
killed
and
eaten
by
us
carnivorous
sinners
but
are
you
not
to
a
certain
extent
participators
in
the
deed
vegetarian
yes
frankly
to
a
certain
extent
a
very
limited
extent
i
think
we
are
we
are
content
to
get
rid
of
the
worst
evils
first
consistency
man
but
is
one
sort
of
killing
worse
than
another
vegetarian
immeasurably
worse
even
if
it
were
necessary
under
the
vegetarian
system
to
destroy
some
of
the
calves
at
birth
as
the
superfluous
young
of
domestic
animals
are
now
destroyed
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
compare
such
restricted
killing
of
creatures
with
the
present
wholesale
butchery
of
and
animals
in
the
consistency
man
you
say
if
it
were
necessary
but
is
there
any
doubt
of
it
vegetarian
it
is
not
by
any
means
so
certain
as
you
suppose
that
the
slaughter
of
calves
would
be
unavoidable
vegetarians
use
milk
more
so
than
a
limited
amount
of
milk
is
obtainable
without
killing
the
calf
nor
is
there
any
reason
as
professor
newman
has
pointed
out
why
a
number
of
oxen
should
not
be
employed
as
formerly
in
working
the
land
but
i
do
not
wish
to
take
refuge
in
future
possibilities
i
prefer
to
take
the
argument
by
the
horns
and
admit
that
under
present
conditions
we
are
indirectly
responsible
call
it
inconsistency
if
you
like
if
it
be
inconsistency
not
to
postpone
the
abolition
of
the
greater
cruelties
until
we
also
abolish
the
minor
ones
we
are
willing
to
be
called
inconsistent
it
may
be
noted
in
passing
that
the
zeal
with
which
urge
this
of
inconsistency
is
designed
unconsciously
perhaps
to
hide
an
important
that
where
eggs
and
milk
are
used
there
is
no
necessity
for
butchers
meat
or
in
other
words
that
vegetarianism
is
a
perfectly
feasible
diet
eggs
and
milk
says
smith
when
objecting
to
their
use
by
vegetarians
contain
a
much
larger
quantity
of
nutritive
material
than
an
equal
amount
of
meat
for
which
therefore
they
may
easily
serve
as
substitutes
if
this
be
granted
the
rest
is
a
mere
battle
of
words
footnote
november
but
the
argument
with
which
may
be
linked
the
objection
to
the
use
of
leather
is
only
one
of
many
departments
of
the
consistency
trick
another
favourite
method
of
convicting
vegetarians
of
inconsistency
is
to
start
from
the
false
assumption
that
vegetarianism
is
the
same
thing
as
brahminism
and
that
any
destruction
of
even
the
lowliest
forms
of
life
is
therefore
reprehensible
as
for
the
argument
based
on
the
cruelty
of
says
stead
i
do
see
that
it
bears
upon
the
question
unless
you
take
the
extreme
hindoo
doctrine
as
to
the
wickedness
of
taking
sentient
life
even
in
the
shape
of
lice
and
adders
that
is
to
say
the
terrible
and
quite
unnecessary
cruelties
inflicted
on
the
most
and
harmless
animals
in
the
and
do
not
even
bear
upon
the
morality
of
diet
unless
we
also
abstain
from
killing
the
most
noxious
and
forms
of
the
same
nature
is
the
foolish
fallacy
which
argues
that
as
we
necessarily
swallow
minute
organisms
in
drinking
we
need
have
no
scruples
as
to
the
needless
butchery
of
a
cow
or
a
sheep
the
savages
who
in
the
good
old
times
used
to
eat
their
grandfathers
and
grandmothers
might
have
justified
their
dietetic
habits
on
precisely
similar
grounds
nor
is
it
only
insects
and
vermin
on
whose
behalf
the
consistency
man
is
concerned
for
plants
also
have
life
and
therefore
if
the
vegetarian
holds
that
it
is
immoral
to
take
life
which
he
does
he
must
be
inconsistent
in
eating
vegetables
as
an
instance
of
a
common
but
strange
misunderstanding
of
the
vegetarian
principle
on
this
subject
i
must
here
quote
a
passage
from
the
science
jottings
of
andrew
wilson
note
the
triumphant
tone
of
the
unscientific
scientist
as
he
rushes
to
his
absurd
conclusion
i
have
not
yet
finished
with
the
food
faddist
suppose
i
find
a
vegetarian
who
more
consistent
than
the
run
of
his
fellows
will
not
touch
taste
nor
handle
milk
eggs
cheese
or
any
animal
product
whatever
i
think
it
is
still
possible
to
show
him
that
he
is
infringing
the
code
he
lives
by
in
so
far
as
its
pretensions
with
the
sacredness
of
life
are
concerned
plants
no
less
than
animals
are
living
things
their
tissues
contain
living
protoplasm
which
is
the
essential
physical
basis
of
life
everywhere
i
am
afraid
that
the
consistent
vegetarian
must
no
longer
kill
a
cabbage
if
he
is
to
live
up
to
the
standard
of
morals
he
sets
up
as
a
kind
of
fetish
in
his
diet
regulations
and
to
lay
low
the
lettuce
or
pluck
the
apple
from
its
bough
is
really
a
direct
infringement
of
the
code
which
maintains
that
you
have
no
right
to
kill
any
living
thing
for
food
really
this
is
a
monstrous
doctrine
when
all
is
said
and
done
footnote
london
may
it
a
monstrous
doctrine
and
what
are
we
to
think
of
a
man
of
science
who
attributes
such
absurdities
to
vegetarians
and
thereupon
holds
them
up
to
public
contempt
as
inconsistent
when
by
making
inquiry
he
might
at
once
have
learnt
that
the
blunder
was
on
his
own
side
once
more
then
be
it
stated
that
it
is
not
the
mere
taking
of
life
but
the
taking
of
life
that
the
vegetarian
deprecates
and
that
no
criticism
of
vegetarianism
can
be
of
any
relevance
if
it
ignores
the
fact
that
all
forms
of
life
are
not
of
equal
value
but
that
the
higher
the
sensibility
of
the
animal
and
the
closer
his
affinity
to
ourselves
the
stronger
his
claim
on
our
humaneness
before
leaving
this
question
of
consistency
as
affected
by
the
of
our
duty
of
humaneness
to
animals
a
few
words
may
be
said
on
the
practice
of
it
was
humorously
suggested
by
sir
henry
thompson
who
as
i
have
proved
in
the
second
chapter
of
this
work
wrote
in
complete
ignorance
of
the
facts
and
dates
of
the
vegetarian
movement
that
as
vegetarians
have
added
milk
and
eggs
to
their
diet
since
their
society
was
founded
a
statement
quite
devoid
of
truth
they
may
perhaps
still
further
enlarge
their
dietary
so
as
to
include
fish
here
again
sir
thompson
only
showed
his
unfamiliarity
with
the
subject
for
his
novel
proposition
was
in
fact
an
old
one
which
has
been
debated
and
rejected
by
the
vegetarian
society
in
its
adherence
to
its
original
rule
of
excluding
fish
flesh
and
fowl
and
nothing
else
from
its
dietary
so
far
then
as
organised
vegetarianism
is
concerned
those
who
eat
fish
are
not
within
the
pale
of
membership
but
looked
at
from
the
purely
standpoint
it
must
be
admitted
that
there
is
an
immense
difference
between
and
and
that
those
unattached
food
reformers
not
few
in
number
who
for
humane
reasons
abstain
from
flesh
but
feel
justified
in
eating
fish
hold
a
perfectly
intelligible
position
and
i
would
further
note
that
the
very
fact
of
there
having
been
some
disposition
wise
or
unwise
within
the
vegetarian
ranks
to
recognise
the
comparative
harmlessness
of
corroborates
what
i
have
asserted
the
of
vegetarianism
has
not
been
a
pedantic
crusade
against
animal
substances
but
a
practical
desire
to
abolish
the
horrors
of
the
this
then
is
our
parting
word
to
the
professors
of
the
consistency
trick
if
they
had
charged
us
with
the
is
with
sacrificing
the
spirit
to
the
letter
by
overlooking
graver
cruelties
while
denouncing
minor
should
have
been
fully
prepared
to
meet
so
serious
an
accusation
but
as
they
have
not
done
this
but
have
merely
twitted
us
with
not
attempting
everything
at
once
and
with
allowing
the
subordinate
evil
to
wait
until
the
central
evil
has
been
grappled
with
we
cheerfully
admit
the
as
it
does
such
is
the
humour
of
the
situation
from
those
who
are
themselves
desirous
of
perpetuating
kinds
of
suffering
the
greater
and
the
smaller
alike
we
beg
to
assure
them
that
we
would
much
rather
be
inconsistently
humane
than
consistently
cruel
the
degradation
of
the
butcher
but
this
question
of
butchery
is
not
merely
one
of
kindness
or
unkindness
to
animals
for
by
the
very
facts
of
the
case
it
is
a
question
of
no
slight
importance
affecting
as
it
does
the
social
and
moral
welfare
of
those
more
immediately
concerned
in
it
of
all
recognised
occupations
by
which
in
civilised
countries
a
livelihood
is
sought
and
obtained
the
work
which
is
looked
upon
with
the
greatest
loathing
next
to
the
hangman
is
that
of
the
witness
the
opprobrious
sense
which
the
word
butcher
has
acquired
owing
to
the
instinctive
horror
of
bloodshed
which
is
characteristic
of
all
normal
civilised
beings
the
trade
of
doing
to
death
countless
numbers
of
inoffensive
and
creatures
amid
scenes
of
indescribable
filth
and
ferocity
is
the
large
towns
at
any
a
pariah
class
of
slaughtermen
who
are
thus
themselves
made
the
victims
of
a
grievous
social
wrong
i
only
doing
your
dirty
work
it
such
as
makes
such
as
is
said
to
have
been
the
remark
of
a
whitechapel
butcher
to
a
gentleman
who
remonstrated
with
him
for
his
brutality
and
the
remark
was
a
perfectly
just
one
to
demand
a
product
which
can
only
be
procured
at
the
cost
of
the
intense
suffering
of
the
animal
and
the
deep
degradation
of
the
butcher
and
by
a
process
which
not
one
in
a
hundred
would
himself
under
any
circumstances
perform
or
even
witness
is
conduct
as
callous
selfish
and
unsocial
as
could
well
be
imagined
for
butchery
as
sir
benjamin
richardson
used
to
point
out
is
essentially
a
dangerous
trade
it
not
only
deadens
and
destroys
the
moral
sympathies
but
it
has
the
physical
effect
of
straining
the
nerves
and
weakening
the
heart
of
the
slaughterman
and
thus
naturally
induces
a
tendency
to
have
recourse
to
drink
how
often
too
in
reading
of
some
murderous
crime
has
one
seen
it
stated
that
the
criminal
was
a
butcher
as
for
instance
in
the
austrian
ripper
case
when
as
the
papers
stated
a
woman
of
the
unfortunate
class
was
killed
by
a
young
butcher
of
herculean
frame
by
whom
it
is
supposed
a
previous
victim
had
also
been
slaughtered
to
have
accustomed
one
self
to
a
total
disregard
for
the
pleading
terror
of
sensitive
animals
and
to
a
murderous
use
of
the
knife
is
a
terrible
power
for
society
to
put
into
the
hands
of
its
lowest
and
least
responsible
members
the
blame
must
ultimately
fall
on
society
itself
and
not
on
the
individual
slaughterman
no
one
had
a
better
knowledge
of
this
subject
than
the
late
lester
and
this
is
his
opinion
we
must
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
the
ranks
of
slaughtermen
are
habitually
made
up
from
persons
in
whom
one
could
hardly
expect
to
find
the
sentiment
of
pity
strongly
developed
yet
even
among
these
there
is
a
certain
air
of
dissatisfaction
with
the
work
they
are
compelled
to
do
and
a
mixture
of
insolence
and
shamefacedness
of
swagger
and
evident
dislike
of
inspection
which
makes
one
think
they
know
their
trade
is
a
nasty
one
only
bearable
from
lack
of
other
employment
and
from
the
good
wages
earned
but
there
are
plenty
of
men
engaged
in
this
work
of
killing
animals
for
food
who
are
much
too
good
for
the
business
these
will
tell
you
openly
that
they
dislike
the
job
but
will
have
meat
and
if
they
were
to
give
it
up
someone
else
would
step
into
the
work
footnote
behind
the
scenes
in
again
subordinate
to
the
actual
butchery
there
are
certain
disgusting
if
not
dangerous
occupations
such
as
that
of
the
women
who
work
in
or
near
the
cattle
markets
at
the
malodorous
task
of
preparing
animal
entrails
for
commercial
uses
of
which
process
the
following
account
has
been
given

in
the
ugly
business

when
the
greasy
slimy
intestinal
skins
come
to
them
for
the
scraping
off
of
all
fat
and
substance
still
attaching
to
them
they
are
washed
twisted
up
dressed
with
salt
and
are
ready
for
the
on
whose
behalf
they
have
been
thus
prepared
the
journalistic
comment
is
that
in
an
ideal
world
men
would
not
permit
women
to
do
work
from
which
every
instinct
of
refinement
and
even
decency
shrinks
but
that
all
is
by
the
demands
of
cheapness
this
as
things
go
is
undeniable
but
it
would
be
well
that
conscientious
should
at
least
realise
what
their
diet
imposes
on
other
people
footnote

that
however
is
just
what
they
are
mostly
determined
to
realise
doubtless
from
a
subconscious
apprehension
that
if
once
they
begin
to
look
into
this
unsavoury
subject
they
may
be
pushed
to
the
verge
of
certain
awkward
conclusions
nothing
is
more
significant

the
extreme
unwillingness
of
philanthropists

members
of
ethical
societies
who
debate
almost
every

under

give
serious
attention
to
the
question
of
reluctance
which
may
be
taken
as
one
of

november
and
so
they
go
their
ways
the
philanthropist
to
build
homes
the
ethical
folk
to
talk
learnedly
and
the
social
reformer
to
concoct
schemes
for
the
amelioration
of
the
human
race
yet
meantime
these
very
persons
are
themselves
perpetuating
by
their
mode
of
living
the
evil
conditions
which
they
profess
to
be
anxious
to
remove
and
condemning
the
pariah
slaughterman
to
a
life
of
sheer
bestiality
the
says
lester
accepts
the
results
of
this
man
demoralisation
of
character
pious
and
professed
christians
are
content
to
allow
the
deep
degradation
of
the
nature
of
a
whole
class
of
men
set
apart
to
do
the
nation
dirty
work
of
slaughtering
without
an
apparent
thought
of
the
baseness
of
their
conduct
here
as
i
said
at
the
outset
is
a
distinctively
question
and
one
which
can
not
be
evaded
even
by
those
slippery
reasoners
who
would
shuffle
out
of
the
duty
of
humaneness
to
animals
by
pretending
in
the
face
of
evolutionary
science
that
there
is
no
bond
of
consanguinity
between
the
animals
and
mankind
by
no
possible
sophistry
can
educated
people
be
justified
in
placing
this
heavy
burden
of
butchery
on
the
hands
of
their
social
inferiors
the
vivisector
and
the
sportsman
have
at
least
the
courage
to
do
their
own
devilries
and
the
work
even
of
the
hardened
agents
of
murderous
millinery
and
the
is
diversified
to
some
extent
by
travel
and
adventure
but
the
slaughterman
task
is
one
of
unrelieved
unmitigated
brutality
involving
the
constant
and
systematic
doing
of
deeds
that
are
inhuman
in
themselves
degrading
to
the
rough
men
who
do
them
and
trebly
disgraceful
to
the
polite
ladies
and
gentlemen
at
whose
behest
they
are
done
the
æsthetic
argument
closely
connected
with
the
humane
argument
is
the
æsthetic
argument
the
two
being
in
fact
twin
branches
of
the
same
stem
for
humane
as
the
latin
shows
has
the
double
meaning
of
gentle
and
refined
so
that
humanity
in
the
original
conception
of
the
term
implies
not
only
a
moral
regard
for
the
rights
of
our
but
also
an
æsthetic
appreciation
of
what
is
beautiful
and
pure
culture
and
together
with
justice
and
compassion
are
the
characteristics
of
humane
man
and
the
fact
that
this
twofold
sense
of
the
word
has
been
forgotten
in
the
education
of
the
modern
gentleman
may
serve
to
explain
why
there
is
often
such
a
grievious
lack
of
gentleness
in
persons
who
claim
to
be
refined
our
are
a
mere
academic
course
of
the
element
being
altogether
left
out
of
account
and
to
such
bathos
has
this
divorce
of
gentleness
and
refinement
carried
us
that
in
some
quarters
a
professor
of
humanity
teacher
of
latin
grammar
we
are
prepared
then
to
find
that
the
æsthetic
or
artistic
faculty
of
the
present
day
is
deplorably
narrow
in
its
scope
and
is
so
ignorant
of
the
true
relationship
of
humanity
and
art
that
it
actually
prides
itself
on
omitting
from
its
ken
all
humane
considerations
while
it
diligently
searches
for
the
beautiful
and
the
picturesque
as
if
beauty
were
a
thing
detached
from
the
realities
of
life
the
bare
idea
that
there
is
an
æsthetic
side
to
the
diet
question
beyond
the
mere
delicacies
of
cookery
and
embellishments
of
the
would
be
scouted
as
ridiculous
by
out
of
a
hundred
of
our
artists
or
literary
men
for
the
very
force
of
habit
which
has
made
them
so
quick
to
resent
the
least
technical
flaw
in
their
special
departments
of
work
has
left
them
blindly
indifferent
to
the
hideous
and
revolting
aspects
of
to
these
æsthetes
the
sight
of
an
ugly
house
for
example
is
a
sore
trouble
and
grievance
but
the
with
all
its
gruesome
doings
is
a
matter
of
supreme
rather
a
thing
to
be
indirectly
patronised
and
defended
i
have
known
a
case
where
an
æsthetic
lady
of
great
personal
culture
and
the
centre
of
a
polished
circle
stained
the
floor
of
her
charming
suburban
villa
with
bullock
blood
brought
from
the
shambles
in
a
bucket
yet
the
æsthete
does
not
usually
vindicate
his
carnivorous
diet
and
its
appurtenances
with
the
old
unhesitating
heartiness
of
the
barbarian
he
is
somewhat
ashamed
of
these
latter
days
even
as
the
cannibal
is
ashamed
when
the
discussion
turns
upon
long
pig
like
all
the
apologists
of
in
their
respective
spheres
he
is
shifty
and
evasive
in
his
defences
and
is
not
too
proud
in
his
moment
of
extremity
to
have
recourse
to
the
consistency
trick
and
to
try
to
trip
up
his
vegetarian
persecutor
with
the
retort
of
you
another
from
which
signs
of
grace
it
may
be
surmised
that
the
æsthete
in
spite
of
his
brave
exterior
is
not
quite
at
ease
in
his
dietetic
philosophy
and
that
the
products
of
butchery
are
in
a
very
real
sense
the
skeleton
in
the
cupboard
the
larder
cupboard
of
literature
and
art
æsthete
pray
why
do
you
address
yourself
to
in
that
significant
manner
vegetarian
because
i
understand
that
you
cultivate
the
artistic
sense
you
love
to
have
beautiful
things
about
you
do
you
not
so
you
must
needs
wish
to
be
a
vegetarian
æsthete
i
love
beautiful
things
certainly
art
is
my
vocation
but
what
has
vegetarianism
to
do
with
it
vegetarian
have
the
arrangements
of
the
nothing
to
do
with
cloth
the
silver
the
glasses
the
dessert
the
flowers
æsthete
a
great
deal
obviously
there
is
much
art
in
dining
well
vegetarian
yet
the
meats
that
are
served
at
the
table
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
is
not
that
rather
contradictory
æsthete
i
did
not
say
that
the
cookery
is
an
essential
point
of
course
vegetarian
but
what
of
the
thing
cooked
what
it
what
it
and
how
did
it
come
to
be
on
your
plate
æsthete
i
never
think
of
such
questions
so
long
as
it
is
nice
i
am
content
it
must
satisfy
my
taste
that
is
all
vegetarian
but
are
you
sure
that
it
satisfy
your
taste
in
the
same
way
that
other
things
do
i
think
not
for
you
have
never
put
it
to
the
trial
in
no
other
branch
of
art
do
you
take
things
wholly
on
trust
but
you
try
them
by
the
standard
of
an
independent
and
educated
intelligence
in
diet
and
in
diet
only
you
shut
your
eyes
and
open
your
mouth
as
the
children
say
and
never
distinguish
between
a
real
innate
liking
and
the
liking
that
is
merely
traditional
æsthete
gustibus
non
est
vegetarian
about
genuine
tastes
i
admit
disputation
is
idle
but
the
proverb
is
not
true
of
the
sham
tastes
to
which
i
refer
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
discussed
about
æsthete
but
i
assure
you
my
liking
for
a
is
a
genuine
taste
vegetarian
with
full
knowledge
of
the
and
the
do
not
the
antecedents
of
your
cause
you
a
feeling
of
disgust
æsthete
oh
well
if
you
persist
in
thinking
about
it
feeding
causes
disgust
do
you
think
there
is
something
gross
in
the
whole
process
of
ingestion
vegetarian
then
why
not
gorge
on
carrion
at
once
the
moment
you
adopt
the
in
for
a
penny
in
for
a
pound
attitude
you
sacrifice
the
whole
art
of
living
æsthete
but
what
of
the
processes
on
which
vegetarianism
itself
depends
you
talk
of
the
filth
of
the
but
how
about
the
filth
of
market
gardening
to
watch
the
soil
being
manured
if
we
let
our
thoughts
dwell
upon
it
is
enough
to
spoil
all
appetite
for
the
produce
of
the
garden
the
more
delicious
the
asparagus
or
the
strawberries
the
more
we
ought
to
loathe
them
vegetarian
there
i
disagree
with
you
entirely
there
is
nothing
in
the
least
disgusting
to
me
at
any
rate
and
i
speak
from
personal
experience
in
the
manuring
of
the
soil
or
in
any
agricultural
the
contrary
there
is
much
that
is
wholesome
and
cheering
in
this
chemistry
of
nature
the
healthy
mind
takes
a
delight
in
gardening
just
as
it
regards
slaughtering
with
abhorrence
if
you
want
to
see
the
contrast
between
the
effects
of
the
two
professions
on
those
who
practise
them
compare
the
face
of
the
typical
slaughterman
with
that
of
the
typical
gardener
it
is
as
remarkable
as
the
contrast
between
a
butcher
and
a
fruiterer
shop
æsthete
well
it
is
no
use
talking
about
it
our
views
of
life
are
different
you
are
a
social
reformer
and
agitator
and
agitation
is
fatal
to
the
tranquility
of
art
i
am
an
artist
and
do
not
care
a
straw
for
social
reform
my
creed
is
expressed
in
keats
couplet
beauty
is
truth
truth
is
all
ye
know
on
earth
and
all
ye
need
to
know
vegetarian
yes
but
it
is
possible
that
keats
meaning
is
somewhat
deeper
than
you
imagine
it
is
not
your
creed
that
i
quarrel
with
but
your
own
misunderstanding
and
misuse
of
it
that
the
oneness
of
truth
and
beauty
is
knowledge
sufficient
i
admit
but
my
complaint
is
that
you
do
really
know
it
and
therefore
i
regard
your
æstheticism
that
makes
clean
the
outside
of
the
cup
and
the
platter
and
the
outside
mere
vandalism
in
masquerade
nor
is
even
the
outside
of
the
æsthetic
platter
free
from
offence
for
there
is
nothing
more
hideous
to
the
eye
not
to
mention
the
mind
than
the
scorched
corpses
as
bernard
shaw
calls
them
that
are
displayed
on
polite
when
the
are
removed
among
the
customs
at
table
that
deserve
to
be
abolished
wrote
leigh
hunt
is
that
of
serving
up
dishes
that
retain
a
look
of
life
in
with
their
staring
eyes
hares
with
their
hollow
countenances
etc
it
is
in
bad
taste
an
incongruity
an
anomaly
to
say
nothing
of
its
effect
on
morbid
imaginations
perhaps
however
the
most
morbid
imagination
or
lack
of
imagination
is
that
of
the
persons
who
are
disgusted
by
these
ugly
sights
art
and
humanity
then
are
but
two
branches
of
the
same
stock
the
true
humanist
and
the
true
artist
are
own
brethren
to
the
artistic
temperament
in
particular
vegetarianism
has
the
surest
right
of
appeal
for
the
æstheticism
which
can
prate
of
truth
and
beauty
while
it
battens
like
a
ghoul
on
bloodshed
and
suffering
has
abnegated
its
own
principles
and
has
ceased
to
be
artistic
how
would
it
be
possible
for
the
scenes
that
are
hourly
enacted
in
to
be
tolerated
for
a
moment
in
a
community
which
had
any
real
artistic
consciousness
yet
what
æsthetic
protest
except
from
vegetarians
is
ever
raised
against
them
take
for
example
the
following
extract
from
some
notes

of

at

it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
it
is
not
found
possible
in
this
enterprising
establishment
to
can
the
squeak
as
well
as
the
flesh
of

for
such
a
phonographic

might
suggest
certain
novel
thoughts
to
the
refined
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
contentedly
regale
themselves
on
at
polite
for
imagine
what
the
result
would
be
in
studio
and
boudoir
and
if
the
of
the
could
be
but
once
uncanned
and
brought
to
hearing
the
groans
and
screams
of
this
poor
persecuted
race
as
de
quincey
said
of
cats
if
gathered
into
some
great
echoing
hall
of
horrors
would
melt
the
heart
of
the
stoniest
but
far
vaster
and
more
impressive
would
be
the
hall
of
horrors
which
should
contain
the
bitter
cry
of
the
victims
of
the
butcher
would
that
it
were
possible
thus
to
compel
the
æsthetic
to
face
the
music
of
his
misdeeds
and
remember
it
is
not
only
at
the
big
slaughtering
centres
that
these
ugly
trades
are
carried
on
nor
are
they
there
perhaps
at
their
ugliest
but
every
town
and
every
village
has
its
private
where
the
same
carnage
is
performed
the
year
round
on
a
smaller
scale
and
in
a
clumsier
manner
and
everywhere
the
butcher
shop
presents
the
same
ghastly
spectacle
of
quartered
carcases
hanging
and
gloated
over
by
shopping
women
one
would
think
it
incredible
that
any
lover
of
the
beautiful
could
doubt
that
the
national
sense
of
beauty
must
be
seriously
impaired
by
these
disgusting
and
degrading
sights
but
enough
of
the
subject
were
we
to
dwell
too
long
on
it
we
should
be
tempted
to
exclaim
as
was
said
of
another
kind
of
iniquity
while
these
things
are
being
done
beauty
stands
veiled
and
music
is
a
screeching
lie
the
hygienic
argument
the
humane
and
the
æsthetic
aspects
of
vegetarianism
are
constantly
described
by
the
advocates
of
as
sentimental
and
if
it
be
sentimental
to
have
regard
for
the
sufferings
of
animals
and
the
beauty
of
our
own
surroundings
the
charge
will
be
gladly
admitted
but
there
is
also
independent
of
all
considerations
of
humanity
a
distinctly
hygienic
movement
towards
the
disuse
of
flesh
food
on
the
ground
that
such
diet
is
not
only
barbarous
but
unwholesome
it
is
held
that
flesh
food
is
in
itself
a
stimulant
and
that
incidentally
it
is
very
liable
to
transmit
disease
while
vegetarianism
on
the
contrary
is
a
simple
natural
less
inflammatory
diet
which
from
the
earliest
times
has
been
known
and
practised
by
a
few
wise
persons
as
containing
the
secret
of
health
in
germany
especially
the
system
of
natural
living
has
attracted
much
attention
and
the
propaganda
of
food
reform
is
there
mainly
on
those
lines
in
england
less
so
but
here
too
there
are
a
number
of
vegetarians
who
are
hygienists
first
and
humanitarians
afterwards
and
all
humanitarians
are
to
some
extent
hygienists
so
that
it
is
ridiculous
in
any
serious
criticism
of
vegetarianism
to
leave
out
of
sight
as
some
of
our
opponents
do
this
essential
part
of
the
system
there
is
in
fact
a
considerable
scientific
literature
on
the
subject
a
train
of
thought
and
experience
handed
down
from
cornaro
and
gassendi
through
their
successors
cheyne
hartley
lambe
abernethy
and
others
to
such
modern
authorities
as
sir
benjamin
richardson
and
alexander
haig
yet
so
little
known
is
this
testimony
that
it
might
be
imagined
from
the
nervous
apprehension
with
which
the
abandonment
of
flesh
flood
is
regarded
that
vegetarianism
were
some
new
and
hazardous
experiment
whereon
he
who
enters
carries
his
life
in
his
hands
this
ignorance
of
the
claims
of
vegetarianism
to
a
scientific
basis
is
the
result
of
the
indifference
and
prejudice
that
have
always
made
dietetics
the
most
unpopular
of
studies
those
who
are
in
health
not
caring
to
give
more
than
a
passing
thought
to
the
hygienic
quality
of
their
food
while
those
who
are
sick
are
naturally
suspicious
of
change
or
by
medical
advisers
yet
the
moment
impartial
inquiry
is
made
into
the
comparative
benefits
and
perils
of
the
two
modes
of
living
certain
undeniable
facts
begin
to
appear
of
which
the
first
and
most
obvious
though
not
the
most
important
perhaps
are
the
dangers
of
many
indeed
and
unsuspected
by
the
ordinary
man
who
takes
a
good
meat
dinner
are
the
ills
that
flesh
is
heir
to
especially
in
the
diet
of
the
poor
for
as
professor
newman
pointed
out
where
the
population
is
dense
the
poorer
classes
if
they
eat
at
all
are
sure
to
get
a
sensible
portion
of
their
supply
in
an
unwholesome
state
this
assertion
is
no
mere
piece
of
vegetarian
polemics
it
rests
on

the
cause
of

thus
prevalent
among

must
be
sought
partly
in
the
excessive
demand
for
flesh
food
and
the
consequent
high
price
of
meat
which
is
a
great
temptation
to
graziers
to
breed
from
immature
stock
partly
too
in
the
unhealthy
system
of
and
cramming
and
last
but
not

in
the
rough
treatment
to
which
animals
are
exposed
during
their

by

evil
which
is
recognised
by

no

the

shibboleth

carnivorous
science
in
its
changing
treatment
of
the

question
vegetarianism
is
not
impossible
as
we
used
to
be
told
it
was
oh
no

and
even
healthy
life
can
really
be
maintained
on
a
diet
of
vegetables
how
many
thousands
of
doctors
have
asserted
the
contrary
but
the
inferior
of
vegetable
is
the
trouble
the
poor
vegetarians
must
put
their
digestive
organs
to
so
great
a
strain
and
must
eat
so
large
a
bulk
of
food
in
order
to
get
the
requisite
nourishment
why
then
says
the
chemist
should
they
thus
their
systems
when
they
could
digest
a
few
slices
from
a
dead
body
at
so
much
less

now
if
the

were
a
man
of
action
and
not
merely
a
man
of
study
the
practical
aspects
of
this
question
might
at
the
outset
give
him
pause
had
he
known
vegetarians
lived
among
vegetarians
and
talked
with
vegetarians
instead
of
regarding
them
theoretically
he
would
be
aware
that
the
average
vegetarian
eats
decidedly
in
bulk
than
the
average
and
is
seldom
or
never
troubled
with
the
indigestion
that
the
dreads
so
far
from
being
compelled
to
consume
a
greater
bulk
of
food
it
is
the
general
experience
of
those
who
have
adopted
vegetarianism
that
they
eat
much
less
under
the
new
system
than
they
did
under
the
old
and
it
is
a
frequent
marvel
to
them
when
they
dine
with
their
former
messmates
to
see
the
huge
amounts
that
they
devour
there
is
the
further
consideration
entirely
overlooked
in
the
argument
of
the
medical
that
vegetarianism
in
the
current
sense
of
the
word
is
not
a
diet
of
vegetables
only
but
includes
the
use
of
eggs
butter
cheese
and
milk
for
all
which
reasons
the
talk
about
less
cost
of

seems
to
have
little
practical
bearing
on
the
subject
under
discussion
and
it
may
be
suspected
that
the

is
quite
as
fabulous
as
the
phantom

that
have
preceded

i
have

one

so
hofmann

have
settled
this

problem
for

for
they
prove
that
the

can
assimilate
a
greater
percentage
of
animal
than
of
vegetable

in
other
words
that
it
requires
a
greater
exercise
of
digestive
power
to
get
an
equal
amount
of
nourishment
from

what
have
you
to
say
to
that
vegetarian
obviously
it
is
quite
devoid
of
value
unless
we
know
were
the
persons
experimented
on
no
statistics
of
the
comparative
digestibility
of
foods
can
be
of
practical
use
unless
the
habits
and
conditions
of
those
who
digest
the
foods
are
also
noted
custom
and
the
personal
element
are
factors
in
the
result
many
vegetable
foods
nuts
for
example
are
readily
digested
by
vegetarians
accustomed
to
their
use
though
almost
universally
found
indigestible
by
chemist
i
can
not
follow
you
into
that
let
us
keep
clear
of
all
such
sentiment
if
you
please
and
bear
in
mind
the
great
precept
which
andrew
wilson
in
his
application
of
hofmann
figures
has
laid
down
for
our
guidance
that
animal
matter
being
likest
to
our
own
composition
is
most
easily
and
readily
converted
into
ourselves
vegetarian
with
all
due
deference
to
the
andrew

formula
may
i
ask
what
matter
likest
to
our
own

why
matter
of
course
vegetarian
yes
but
animal
matter
chemist
oh
we
do
go
into
that
vegetarian
but
i
do
and
i
beg
you
to
observe
that
the
matter
likest
to
our
own
composition
is
flesh
so
that
according
to
the
andrew
wilson
formula
we
all
ought
to
be
cannibals
because
for
human
beings
human
flesh
must
be
the
most
digestible
of
foods
chemist
very
likely
it
is
so
though
i
do
not
approve
of
cannibalism
vegetarian
then
allow
me
to
read
you
a
sentence
from
gordon
cumming
book
at
home
in
fiji
at
every
cannibal
feast
there
was
served
a
certain
vegetable
also
commonly
used
by
the
cannibal
maoris
of
new
zealand
which
was
considered
as
essential
an
adjunct
as
is
to
lamb
or
sage
to
goose
its
use
however
was
prudential
as
human
flesh
found
to
be
highly
and
this
herb
acted
as
a
corrective
now
i
ask
you
if
that
does
not
logically
dispose
of
the
andrew
wilson
formula
chemist
nonsense
sir
i
will
not
discuss
cannibalism
you
fail
to
see
that
some
things
though
logical
enough
may
not
be
expedient
vegetarian
i
am
delighted
to
hear
you
say
that
i
beg
you
to
remember
it
when
you
next
talk
of
experiments
it
is
possible
that
like
cannibalism
is
not
expedient
when
it
is
regarded
from
a
wider
standpoint
than
that
of
the
chemical
doctrinaire
nothing
indeed
could
be
more
than
the
attitude
taken
on
this
question
by
scientists
of
the
andrew
wilson
type
for
in
the
first
place
as
pointed
out
above
it
is
impossible
to
arrive
at
any
scientific
conclusion
as
to
the
comparative
digestibility
of
vegetable
and
animal
foods
unless
the
conditions
are
is
unless
the
persons
experimented
on
are
equally
accustomed
to
the
they
are
invited
to
digest
and
secondly
there
is
the
question
of
the
quality
of
the
foods
supplied
for
as
oldfield
has
remarked
it
is
quite
as
unfair
to
judge
of
the
digestibility
of
the
proteid
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
from
one
example
of
the
legumens
as
it
would
be
to
class
all
forms
of
flesh
as
indigestible
because
veal
or
lobster
happens
to
be
so
against
the
academic
testimony
of
the
hofmann
school
of
specialists
we
may
confidently
set
that
of
so
distinguished
a
practical
chemist
as
sir
richardson
who
by
his
personal
knowledge
of
vegetarians
and
vegetarianism
was
peculiarly
qualified
to
judge
from
experimental
observations
which
i
have
made
i
am
of
opinion
that
the
vegetable
substances
may
be
as
easily
digested
when
they
are
presented
to
the
stomach
in
proper
form

the
true
function
of

in

is
to
help

to

some
of

needed
for
the
construction

there
should
be
no

except
the
labour
of
research
in
so
modifying

from
its
prime
source
as
to
make
it
applicable
to
every
necessity
without
the
assistance
of
any

not

practise

you
take
your

the

you
admit
you
do

where
as

oh

no

you

it
your

to
interfere
with
the

when
they
take
their

have
you
observed
that
it
is
in

the

why
do
you
remind
me
of
that

show
you
that
all
this
talk
about
vegetarianism
being
a
matter
of
climate
is
pure
humbug
the
use
of
flesh
is
a
vicious
habit
everywhere

nowhere
a

where
other

is
not
procurable

undoubtedly
but
these
can
be
readily
obtained
without
recourse
to

british

then
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
that
northern
races
have
been
to
so
great
an
extent
carnivorous
vegetarian
perhaps
because
in
primitive
times
hunting
and
pasturage
were
less
toilsome
than
agriculture
but
i
am
not
called
on
to
account
for
such
a
fact
their
past
addiction
to
flesh
food
no
more
proves
the
present
utility
of
than
their
gross
drinking
habits
prove
the
utility
of
alcohol
british
islander
can
you
quote
any
scientific
authority
for
your
contention
vegetarian
there
is
one
which
is
all
the
more
valuable
because
it
is
an
admission
made
by
an
opponent
sir
william
lawrence
wrote
that
men
can
be
perfectly
nourished
and
that
their
physical
and
intellectual
capabilities
can
be
fully
developed
in
any
climate
by
a
diet
purely
vegetable
has
been
proved
by
such
abundant
experience
that
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
adduce
any
formal
arguments
on
the
subject
in
any
climate
mark
and
a
diet
purely
vegetable
whereas
all
are
asked
to
do
is
to
forego
the
actual
flesh
foods
and
not
the
animal
products
but
come
now
ask
me
the
great
question
footnote

man
british

what
is
that
there

i
had
in

what

i
have

the
disinterested
concern
of
the

looms
ahead
for
the
future
of

perhaps
the
question

what

scarcely

the

for
that
matter
what
would
become

if
you
can
not
dissociate
your

do
you

at

they
have
a
better
reason
for
eating
blubber
than
some

have
for

can
get
nothing
else
the
dishonesty
of
the
excuse
that
vegetarianism
may
be
all
very
well
in
the
tropics
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
englishmen
when
living
in
the
tropics
make
precisely
the
contrary
statement
you
would
be
surprised
writes
adams
from
ceylon
if
you
knew
how
much
prejudice

opposition
there

the
most

part
is
that

it

useless
from

that
a

will
have

of
carrying
his
principles
into

one
who
is
the

of
widely
current
opinions
to
the
propagation
of
which
he
devotes
perhaps
an
equal
amount
of
ability
for
this
reason
it
is
absurd
to
suggest
that
vegetarians
or
any
other
class
of
unpopular

are
living
on
a

it

untrue
but
the
contrary
of
the
truth
no

suggests
says

that
the
english
climate
is
too
cold
for

in

more
rigorous
developing

superior
to
the

this
upon
a
dietary
which
for
generations
has
been
so
largely
vegetarian
that
no
one
would
dream
of
saying
that
the
small
amount
of

eaten
by
them
could
have
had
anything
to

show
that

a
piece

rests
upon

the

at

that
whereas

those
who
are
working
towards
a
more
or
less
distant
goal
to
give
a
precise
geometrical
survey
of
their
promised
land
in
the
case
of
vegetarianism
the
answerable
doubts
and
difficulties
fall
mostly
under
two
heads
relating
first
to
the
alarming
discomforts
which
the
loss
of
would
entail
upon
mankind
and
secondly
to
the
not
less
grievous
straits
to
which
the
animals
themselves
would
be
reduced
under
so
misguided
a
régime
let
us
take
the
selfish
view
first
as
containing
perhaps
a
modicum
of
real
feeling
which
can
scarcely
be
found
in
that
suspicious
concern
for
the
animals
there
are
some
folk
it
seems
over
whose
troubled
minds
there
really
hang
like
a
nightmare
the
alarmist
vision
of
a
world
impoverished
and
dismantled
by
world
leather
bone
soap
candles
manure
everything
alarmist
but
this
is
mere
trifling
it
is
idle
to
talk
of
the
humanity
the
wholesomeness
the
economy
of
a
vegetarian
diet
while
you
are
overlooking
the
disastrous
consequences
that
stare
you
in
the
face
we
may
perhaps
be
able
as
you
say
to
exist
without
meat
but
what
could
we
do
without
leather
and
the
other
animal
substances
on
which
civilisation
depends
vegetarian
well
i
suppose
we
should
take
care
to
be
without
them
or
something
just
as
good
alarmist
how
could
we
do
that
if
there
were
no
carcases
to
supply
us
with
hides
bone
and
tallow
in
your
devotion
to
an
ideal
you
seem
to
forget
that
if
your
principles
prevailed
we
might
wake
up
some
fine
morning
to
find
ourselves
confronted
by
the
dislocation
of
the
boot
trade
the
bookbinding
trade
the
harness
trade
and
a
hundred
others
thousands
of
men
and
women
would
be
thrown
out
of
work
and
we
should
soon
have
no
boots
no
portmanteaus
no
soap
no
candles
no
it
would
be
a
downright
relapse
into
barbarism
vegetarian
but
happily
your
lurid
picture
is
based
on
the
false
assumption
that
vegetarianism
would
come
about
by
a
sudden
and
instantaneous
conversion
that
is
not
the
way
in
which
great
changes
are
accomplished
they
are
a
matter
of
years
and
centuries
not
of
days
and
weeks
and
the
fine
morning
you
spoke
of
will
be
a
gradual
morning
of
very
extensive
duration
alarmist
well
but
that
is
only
putting
off
the
evil
would
come
at
last
vegetarian
but
would
not
something
else
have
also
been
coming
meantime
would
not
the
demand
in
this
as
in
all
other
usages
of
life
have
produced
the
corresponding
supply
there
is
no
need
however
to
speculate
as
to
what
happen
because
it
is
happening
already
alarmist
what
is
happening
vegetarian
the
articles
which
you
named
are
being
supplied
in
substitutes
from
the
vegetable
kingdom
slowly
and
tentatively
at
first
as
is
inevitable
while
vegetarians
are
so
few
in
numbers
but
vegetarian
boots
vegetarian
soap
and
vegetarian
candles
are
now
in
the
market
and
as
the
movement
spreads
the
demand
will
be
proportionately
greater
so
pray
do
not
alarm
yourself
about
the
dislocation
of
trade
for
the
whole
change
great
as
it
is
will
come
to
pass
imperceptibly
and
will
never
bring
a
moment
inconvenience
to
anyone
mankind
as
it
happens
is
not
so
helpless
so
uninventive
so
literally
hidebound
as
to
let
its
progress
be
dependent
on
skins
bones
and
guts
there
is
a
good
deal
of
unintended
humour
too
in
some
of
the
difficulties
that
are
alleged
thus
vegetarians
are
often
asked
how
the
land
could
be
fertilised
without
the
use
of
animal
manure
it
being
apparently
forgotten
that
nihilo
nihil
and
that
animals
can
only
return
to
the
land
in
manure
what
they
have
previously
taken
from
it
in
food
also
that
by
our
absurdly
wasteful
drainage
system
we
are
all
the
time
poisoning
our
seas
and
rivers
with
a
mass
of
sewage
which
would
be
amply
sufficient
for
the
soil
let
the
land
says
william
hoyle
only
receive
in
the
shape
of
manure
the
sewage
and
refuse
from
the
teeming
population
of
our
towns
and
villages
in
addition
to
the
other
means
which
are
applied
to
it
and
let
it
be
properly
drained
and
cultivated
and
there
is
hardly
any
limit
to
its
power
of
production
footnote
our
national
resources
but
it
is
superfluous
to
spend
time
in
answering
such
questions
for
their
silliness
is
far
in
excess
of
their
honesty
for
years
the
opponents
of
vegetarianism
in
the
press
had
been
asking
what
should
we
do
without
leather
etc
yet
as
soon
as
the
substitutes
for
these
articles
began
to
be
exhibited
at
the
annual
vegetarian
congress
the
note
was
changed
and
the
reporters
remarked
that
the
exhibition
was
not
of
much
interest
until
we
found
the
london
correspondent
of
a
big
provincial
paper
actually
complaining
that
the
crusade
against
meat
of
every
kind
even
against
at
this
exhibition
they
have
boots
and
shoes
made
of
imitation
leather
is
carrying
the
reform
a
little
too
far
our
critics
are
hard
to
satisfy
we
are
going
a
little
too
far
if
we
produce
a
substitute
for
leather
if
we
do
not
produce
one
we
are
not
going
far
enough
and
now
with
all
becoming
gravity
we
turn
to
the
second
branch
of
our
disinterested
inquiry
as
to
what
would
become
of
the
animals
if
we
ceased
to
kill
them
for
food
if
the
life
of
animals
says
paul
carus
had
to
be
regarded
as
sacred
as
human
life
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
that
whole
industries
would
be
destroyed
and
human
civilisation
would
at
once
drop
down
to
a
very
primitive
condition
many
millions
would
starve
and
large
cities
would
disappear
from
the
face
of
the
earth
but
the
brute
creation
would
suffer
too
there
might
be
a
temporary
increase
of
brute
life
but
certainly
not
of
happiness
cattle
would
only
be
raised
for
and
and
they
would
not
die
the
sudden
death
at
the
hands
of
the
butcher
but
slowly
of
old
age
or
by
disease
footnote
the
open
court
a
pathetic
picture
indeed
it
does
not
for
a
moment
occur
to
this
sapient
prophet
of
disaster
that
the
adoption
of
vegetarianism
will
necessarily
be
gradual
and
further
that
vegetarians
do
hold
the
life
of
animals
to
be
as
sacred
as
human
life
to
critics
who
do
not
even
ascertain
what
the
system
means
before
they
reject
it
and
who
ignore
all
consideration
of
the
degrees
and
relative
sacredness
of
the
various
forms
of
life
vegetarianism
must
naturally
seem
to
be
a
confused
jumble
of
confusion
in
reality
being
altogether
on
their
own
side
alarmist
there
is
another
aspect
of
this
question
and
a
very
grave
one
if
were
abolished
what
would
become
of
the
animals
vegetarian
yes
let
us
talk
about
that
fearful
contingency
you
think
they
would
be
thrown
out
of
employment
so
to
find
their
careers
cut
short
or
rather
left
long
alarmist
it
is
no
joking
matter
would
they
not
run
wild
in
numbers
and
perhaps
overrun
the
land
or
if
food
failed
them
lie
dead
and
dying
about
our
roadways
and
suburbs
vegetarian
before
i
relieve
your
anxiety
on
this
point
may
i
just
remark
that
this
second
difficulty
seems
to
counterbalance
the
former
one
if
every
suburban
householder
is
likely
to
have
a
dead
ox
against
his
we
evidently
need
not
fear
the
failure
of
the
leather
and
tallow
trade
but
once
again
you
are
mistaken
you
have
overlooked
the
fact
that
the
breeding
of
animals
is
not
free
and
unrestricted
but
is
kept
within
certain
limits
and
carefully
regulated
by
man
so
that
if
the
demand
for
butchers
meat
should
gradually
decline
there
would
be
no
more
alarming
result
than
a
corresponding
gradual
decline
in
the
supply
from
the
breeder
alarmist
well
i
do
know
i
sadly
doubt
whether
things
would
balance
themselves
so
comfortably
vegetarian
ah
you
think
that
some
neglected
old
porker
like
scott
last
minstrel
would
be
left
out
in
the
cold
for
their
date
was
fled
his
tuneful
brethren
all
were
dead
and
he
neglected
and
oppressed
longed
to
be
with
them
and
at
rest
but
no
for
look
at
the
case
of
the
donkey
we
do
not
knowingly
eat
donkeys
yet
a
dead
donkey
is
proverbially
a
rare
sight
nor
are
we
overrun
with
least
not
in
the
sense
referred
to
alarmist
yet
i
understand
that
in
india
where
there
is
a
reluctance
to
kill
animals
they
are
often
in
wretched
plight
true
but
we
were
talking
not
of
animals
but
of
them
vegetarianism
is
not
brahminism
we
would
kill
when
necessary
whether
for
our
own
sake
or
the
animals
but
we
would
not
breed
them
in
vast
numbers
in
order
to
kill
nor
kill
them
in
order
to
eat
surely
the
distinction
is
a
clear
one
the
attitude
of
vegetarians
towards
this
subject
is
indeed
plain
enough
for
those
who
wish
to
understand
it
regarding
the
slaughter
of
animals
for
food
as
cruel
and
unnecessary
they
advocate
its
discontinuance
a
process
which
if
it
comes
about
at
all
will
as
i
have
shown
be
a
gradual
one
and
will
at
no
point
cause
any
sudden
disruption
of
existing
conditions
but
this
does
not
commit
them
to
the
absurd
belief
that
animal
life
in
all
its
various
grades
is
absolutely
sacred
and
inviolable
must
we
not
suspect
that
the
apologists
of
who
make
these
childish
alarums
and
excursions
are
fain
to
do
so
from
some
inner
conviction
of
the
weakness
of
their
own
case
bible
and
beef
bible
and
beer
is
the
title
that
is
sometimes
sarcastically
applied
to
the
political
alliance
between
churchmen
and
publicans
and
in
like
manner
the
dietetic
alliance
between
the
unco
guid
and
the
butchers
may
be
not
inaptly
designated
as
bible

beef
when
all
else
fails
the
authority
of

is
triumphantly
cited
by
the
bibliolatrous
as
the
great
court
of
appeal
to
which
the
food
question
must
be
carried
and
here
at
least
it
is
pleaded
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
verdict
it
seems
to
me
wrote
william
paley
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
defend
this
right
to
the
flesh
of
animals
by
any
arguments
which
the
light
and
order
of
nature
afford
and
that
we
are
beholden
for
it
to
the
permission
recorded
in
scripture
footnote
moral
and
political
philosophy
it
is
a
far
cry
from
the
theologian
of
to
the
of
but
from
an
editorial
article
we
learn
that
the
organ
of
the
butchering
trade
is
animated
by
the
same
profound
sense
of
piety
the
great
creator
of
all
flesh
it
says
gave
us
the
beasts
of
the
field
not
only
for
our
food
but
for
other
purposes
equally
as
essential
to
us
the
grass
must
be
eaten
by
our
flocks
and
herds
otherwise
the
fertility
of
the
soil
would
vanish
it
was
a
frightful
punishment
on
the
egyptian
king
that
he
should
be
reduced
to
the
level
of
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
eat

footnote
november
now
waiving
the
fact
that
grass
is
not
precisely
the
diet
that
vegetarians
adopt
and
that
it
is
therefore
no
reproach
to
vegetarianism
if
nebuchadnezzar
not
being
a
ruminant
found
such
a
regimen
distasteful
we
must
recognise
that
there
is
a
widespread
idea
among
religious
people
that
the
lower
animals
were
sent
us
as
food
and
that
the
practice
of
has
the
seal
of
biblical
sanction
in
meeting
this
prejudice
there
is
a
right
line
and
a
wrong
line
of
reasoning
both
of
which
have
at
different
times
been
followed
by
vegetarian
speakers
the
wrong
line
is
to
attempt
to
answer
the
texts
quoted
as
favourable
to
by
pitting
against
them
other
texts
as
favourable
to
course
which
not
only
degrades
the
bible
into
a
for
disputants
but
also
surrenders
the
most
sacred
claim
of
the
reformed
its
appeal
not
to
this
or
to
that
textual
authority
which
some
thinkers
accept
and
others
deny
but
to
the
universal
principle
of
humanity
and
justice

in
the
epigram
liber

in
quo

may
be
freely
rendered
this
is
the
book
to

where
each
man
dogma
seeks
and
own
the
right
line
is
to
show
first
that
it
is
wholly
impossible
in
the
face
of
modern
knowledge
and
evolutional
science
to
maintain
the
old
anthropocentric
idea
which
regarded
man
as
the
sum
and
centre
of
the
universe
a
monarch
for
whose
special
benefit
all
else
was
created
and
secondly
that
the
ancient
hebrew
scriptures
whatever
be
their
exact
significance
for
christian
readers
a
matter
with
which
we
are
not
here
concerned
can
not
be
regarded
as
affording
any
clue
to
the
solution
of
modern
problems
which
have
arisen
centuries
later
it
would
be
no
whit
more
absurd
to
argue
that
is
justifiable
because
it
was
not
condemned
in
the
bible
than
to
claim
scriptural
sanction
for
the
cruelties
of
butchery
because
the
jews
were
and
indeed
such
arguments
been
advanced
by
religious
people
in
support
of
slavery
we
read
for
example
the
following
in
john
woolman
journal
a
friend
in
company
began
to
talk
in
support
of
the
and
said
the
negroes
were
understood
to
be
the
offspring
of
cain
their
blackness
being
the
mark
which
god
set
upon
him
after
he
murdered
abel
that
it
was
the
design
of
providence
they
should
be
slaves
as
a
condition
proper
to
the
race
of
so
wicked
a
man
as
cain
was
but
it
is
now
time
to
introduce
the
textualist
in
person
textualist
well
sir
i
understand
that
you
advocate
vegetarianism
what
sort
of
a
religion
is
that
vegetarian
the
real
sort
that
has
to
be
as
well
as
preached
textualist
if
it
is
the
real
sort
the
proof
is
easy
show
me
the
passages
in
the
book
vegetarian
i
beg
to
be
excused
i
do
not
bandy
texts
textualist
what
you
can
produce
no
verses
in
support
of
your
religion
i
thought
vegetarians
relied
on
what
they
call
the
ten
best
texts
and
here
i
stand
ready
to
meet
them
with
better
ones
vegetarian
i
am
sorry
to
disappoint
you
but
i
am
not
one
of
the
vegetarians
i
regard
all
such
methods
of
reasoning
as
wholly
irrelevant
there
is
not
the
least
doubt
that
the
jews
were
a
people
indeed
the
very
idea
of
vegetarianism
that
is
a
deliberate
and
permanent
disuse
of
for
moral
and
hygienic
reasons
was
wholly
unknown
to
them
what
then
can
be
the
use
of
hunting
up
which
do
not
refer
one
way
or
the
other
to
the
point
at
issue
textualist
but
if
it
was
unknown
and
unmentioned
in
the
bible
what
hope
for
vegetarianism
it
perishes
like
all
else
that
is
unscriptural
vegetarian
the
same
hope
as
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
or
any
other
humane
cause
that
has
had
birth
in
our
modern
era
we
live
and
learn
textualist
but
it
is
written
rise
peter
kill
and
eat
what
is
your
answer
to
that
vegetarian
it
needs
no
answer
as
you
will
see
if
you
study
the
context
textualist
then
you
have
not
a
single
text
to
set
against
the
injunction
with
which
i
confront
you
vegetarian
not
it
be
answer
not
a
fool
according
to
his
folly
to
repel
texts
with
texts
is
a
futility
to
which
vegetarians
as
a
body
have
fortunately
not
committed
themselves
because
vegetarianism
appeals
without
reference
to
religion
to
the
common
sentiment
of
humaneness
and
numbers
amongst
its
adherents
men
of
every
nationality
and
creed
if
biblical
vegetarians
have
engaged
in
controversy
with
biblical
that
is
their
own
concern
and
we
may
rest
assured
that
the
battle
will
be
a
sham
one
as
the
firing
is
with
blank
cartridge
on
both
sides
apart
however
from
such
irrational
argument
there
is
a
sense
in
which
an
appeal
may
be
fairly
made
to
the
bible
as
to
any
other
great
ethnical
scripture
or
is
to
the
spirit
as
distinguished
from
the
letter
the
context
as
distinguished
from
the
text
that
vegetarians
preaching
and
practising
a
doctrine
of
love
and
humaneness
should
quote

you

do
they
denounce

so
much
fuss
about
it
all
surely
it
had
been
more
logical
if
while
banishing
from
the

and
perfumes
they
had
exhibited
yet
more
indignation
against
the

though
all
their

merely
regarded

accounts
they

simply
interested

as

towards

to
the

of

these

types
have
no

from

phase
of
when

brutality
was
as

and
a
ad
in

therefore
not
to
be
overlooked
by
those
who
in
their
hostility
to

an
barbarian

into

of

age
when

only

by

and
he
is
candid
enough
to
avow
that
he
does
his
killing
not
like
the
butcher
in
order
to
earn
a
livelihood
but
for
the
brutal
reason
that
he
it
the
instincts
of
the
primeval
man
it
has
been
well
said
predatory
in
the
modern
moral
sanctions
are
disregarded
the
rights
of
inferior
races
are
forgotten
and
the
hunter
feels
himself
figuratively
speaking
naked
savage
bloodthirsty
and
unashamed
a
butcher
he
certainly
is
but
an
amateur
butcher
only
for
it
can
hardly
be
contended
that
the
preserving
of
game
increases
the
national
in
view
of
the
fact
that
pheasants
hares
and
even
rabbits
are
sold
at
a
price
far
below
their
actual
cost
of
production

the
truth
about

laws
cannibalism
again
is
simply
free
from
those
sentimental
restrictions
which
sir
henry
thompson
and
his
fellow
scientists
deplore
and
the
cannibal
only
fault
judged
from
the
scientist
standpoint
is
that
he
carries
out
the
scientific
doctrine
not
wisely
but
too
well
for
this
reason
every
lecture
on
vegetarianism
ought
to
touch
on
cannibalism
as
illustrating
a
past

in
the
great
history
of
past

as
regards
the
leading
and
civilised
nations
but
to
this
day
a
present
and
very
instructive
chapter
in
the
world
remoter
regions
from
which
we
may
learn
certain
lessons
as
to
the
feelings
arguments
and
fallacies
that
attend
the
gradual
process
of
transition
from
one
dietetic
habit
to
another
the
generally
affects
to
look
on
cannibalism
as
something
monstrous
and
abnormal
a
dreadful
perversion
of
taste
which
has
no
connection
with
the
civilised
on
which
our
welfare
is
supposed
to
depend
but
the
real
facts
show
that
the
truth
is
quite
otherwise
and
that
the
position
of
the
cannibal
who
is
being
proselytised
to
give
up
his
is
in
many
ways
analogous
to
that
of
the
who
is
worried
by
the
vegetarian
propagandists
the
glories
of
the
old
english
roast
beef
may
be
instructively
compared
with
the
glories
of
the
old
african
roast
man
it
is
amusing
to
observe
that
the
kreophagist
who
on
the
one
side
regards
abstinence
from
flesh
food
as
an
absurd
delusion
is
equally
confident
that
cannibalism
on
the
other
side
is
an
unpardonable
infamy
forgetting
that
many
of
the
excuses
that
are
made
for
might
be
made
with
as
much
justice
for
cannibalism
also
prejudice
is
strange
says
professor
flinders
petrie
a
large
part
of
mankind
are
cannibals
and
still
more
perhaps
all
have
been
so
including
our
own
forefathers

jerome

the
atticotti
a
british
tribe
as
preferring
human
flesh
to
that
of
cattle
does
the
utilitarian
object
yet
one
main
purpose
of
the
custom
is
utility
in
its
best
and
innocent
forms
it
certainly
gives
the
greatest
happiness
to
the
greatest
number
nor
can
it
be
held
that
all
cannibals
are
a
specially
degraded
race
for
livingstone
and
later
travellers
quote
instances
to
show
that
tribes
addicted
to
are
sometimes
more
advanced
mentally
and
physically
than
those
which
abstain
from
such
diet
and
as
to
the
hygienic
merits
of
the
regimen
does
it
not
stand
on
record
in
an
old
english
ballad
that
richard
cœur
de
lion
was
cured
of
a
dangerous
malady
by
eating
a
turk
head
which
was
served
up
to
him
as
the
best
substitute
for
pork
the
kreophagist
at
present
is
able
to
pass
unlimited
censure
on
the
cannibal
because
the
poor
savage
has
not
the
wit
to
argue
with
the
civilised
man
but
if
in
these
days
of
university
extension
schemes
such
a
person
as
a
scientific
anthropophagist
should
ever
make
his

who
can

might
not

reversed

should
prey

nature

that
is
the

what

they
not

so
long
as
the
kreophagist
does
not
absurdly
claim
that
it
is
a
step
his
case
against
the
anthropophagist
is
a
sure
one
but
if
while
denouncing
anthropophagy
as
a
barbarism
of
the
past
he
refuses
to
see
that
must
also
in

be

himself

that

backwards

distinct
reversion
to
the
rude
and
distant
savagery

decadence

than

on

largely
extended
its
resources

it
is
none
the
less
true
that
while
it
has
acquired
many
new
foods
it
has
abandoned
certain
old
ones
it
has
advanced
in
short
as
already
stated
by

of
eclecticism

we
have
learnt
by
bitter
experience
that
opposition
is
the
last
thing
we
can
expect
to
indeed
is
made
sufficiently
evident
by
argument
for
how
could
individual
vegetarians
have
ever
heard
of
the
new
diet
except
for
the
propaganda
and
why
have
vegetarians
as
a
body
less
right
than
teetotalers
socialists
or
any
other
propagandists
not
to
enforce
but
to
their
philosophy
of
diet
with
the
view
of
ultimately
influencing
public
opinion
this
professional
attempt
to
class
vegetarianism
as
an
idiosyncrasy
and
not
a
system
is
as
irrational
as
it
is
insincere
and
what
its
insincerity
is
may
be
seen
from
the
fact
that
though
we
are
told
at
one
moment
that
there
can
be
no
objection
to
individual
practice
of
the
diet
yet
whenever
individuals
do
attempt
to
practise
it
they
meet
with
the
strongest
possible
objection
from
the
doctors

health
and

thus
it
comes
about
that
in
this
progressive
age
and
even
among
those
who
label
themselves
progressives
vegetarianism
is
so
frequently
regarded
as
a
mere
whim
and
crotchet
with
no
practical
bearing
on
the
forward
movement
of
it

a
marvel
that
so
many

thus
lead
their

to
suppose
that
whereas
on
all
other
matters
there
has
been
a
great
change
of
feeling
during
the
past
on
the
one
matter
of
diet
there
has
been
no
sort
of
progress
yet
they
might
easily
learn
if
they
made
serious
inquiry
that
the
reformed
dietetics
so
far
from
being
the
outcome
of
mere
sentiment
about
animals
have
a
past
record
based
as
surely
on
moral
and
scientific
reasoning
as
that
of
any
cause
included
in
the
progressive
programme
vegetarianism
is
in
truth
in
and
for
a
progressive
to
scout
such
ideas
as
valueless
and
utopian
is
to
play
the
part
as
far
as
diet
is
concerned
of
a
reactionist
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
strange
discrepancy
it
must
mean
we
fear
that
to
a
large
number
of
our
social
reformers
the
reform
of
other
persons
is
a
much
more
congenial
battle

than
the
reform
of
one
self
illæ
they
call
vegetarianism
impracticable
for
the
strange
reason
that
unlike
most
it
asks
them
to
do
something
individually
which
they
know
they
they
wished
it
is
impracticable
because
it
does
not
suit
them
to
practise

reformer
let
me
entreat
you
give
up
this
fanciful
scheme
of
vegetarianism
and
come
and
work
for
social
reform
vegetarian
social
reform
without
food
reform
is
not
that
rather
a
lame
and
business
reformer
not
at
all
when
we
have
so
many
things
to
do
we
must
do
the
most
important
ones
first
vegetarian
and
what
are
the
most
important
reformer
well
there
is
international
peace
and
arbitration
you
will
admit
that
our
first
duty
is
to
avoid
unnecessary
bloodshed
vegetarian
ah
i
see
and
the
habit
of
by
bloodshed
does
come
within
your
scope
reformer
then
there
is
the
land
question
and
the
need
of
relieving
the
congestion
of
our
crowded
cities
by
the
revival
of
agriculture
vegetarian
so
of
course
you
ca
attend
to
a
which
would
bring
people
back
to
the
land
reformer
there
is
also
the
temperance
terrible
evils
of
the
drink

vegetarian
which
would
disappear
for
the
most
part
if
we
left
off
eating
flesh
reformer
and
the
welfare
of
to
that
also
i
devote
myself
we
need
some
stringent
legislation
for
the
better
prevention
of
cruelty
vegetarian
we
do
but
as
such
legislation
would
leave
your
reformers
dinnerless
do
you
think
you
should
revise
your
dietary
meantime
your
reforms
are
excellent
i
grant
you
but
what
of
does
not
reform
like
charity
begin
at
home
reformer
well
well
to
everyone
his
or
i
prefer
the
former
you
the
latter
i
suppose
vegetarian
no
that
is
just
where
you
are
mistaken
i
prefer
both
at
once
reform
not
reform
is
the
true
key
to
the
solution
of
the
social
question
the
work
that
we
can
do
ourselves
is
the
most
wholesome
condiment
for
the
work
that
we
can
only
do
through
society
and
here
let
me
express
the
hope
that
as
a
matter
of
policy
vegetarians
will
stand
aloof
from
all
philanthropic
schemes
of
food
reform
in
prisons
reformatories
and
workhouses
for
there
is
no
surer
way
of
making
a
principle
unpopular
than
by
forcing
it
on
the
poor
and
helpless
while
carefully
avoiding
it
self
philanthropists
if
they
be
philanthropists
will
practise
what
they
preach
by
their
practice
we
shall
know
them
to
the
ethical
no
less
than
to
the
political
school
of
thought
the
question
of
vegetarianism
is
unwelcome
obtruding
as
it
does
on
the
polite
wordiness
of
learned
discussion
with
an
issue
so
coarsely
downright
you
are
a
member
of
an
ethical
you
live
by
butchery
but
the
ethics
of
diet
are
the
very
last
subject
with
which
a
cultured
ethical
society
would
concern
itself
and
the
attitude
of
the
modern
ethicist
towards
the
rights
of
animals
is
still
that
of
the
medieval
schoolman
the
ethicist
does
not
wish
to
forego
his
beef
and
mutton
so
he
frames
his
ethics
to
avoid
the
danger
of
such
mishap
and
while
he
talks
of
high
themes
with
the
serene
wisdom
of
a
philosopher
the
continue
to
run
blood
we
surmise
that
the
royal
founder
and
archetype
of
ethical
societies
was
that
learned
but
futile
monarch
referred
to
in
the
epitaph
here
lies
our
king
whose
word
no
man
relies
on
he
never
a
foolish
thing
and
never
a
wise
one
so
too
throughout
the
whole
field
of
hygiene
temperance
and
plain
living
to
ignore
vegetarianism
is
to
ignore
one
of
the
most
potent
influences
for
one
is
reluctant
to
quote
the
late
sir
henry
thompson
in
any
matter
that
tends
to
the
praise
of
vegetarianism
in
view
of
the
extreme
irritability
which
that
distinguished
scientist
exhibited
as
regards
his
sacred
text
with
which
you
could
never
take
the
liberty
of
assuming
that
when
it
distinctly
said
one
thing
it
did
not
mean
the
opposite
yet
he
say
that
a
proportion
amounting
at
least
to
more
than
of
the
disease
which
embitters
the
middle
and
latter
part
of
life
among
the
middle
and
upper
classes
of
the
population
is
due
to
avoidable
errors
in
diet
if
this
be
so
it
is
obvious
that
diet
reform
of
some
sort
is
very
urgently
needed
and
i
submit
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
frame
any
intelligible
scheme
of
diet
reform
in
which
vegetarian
principles
should
play
no
part
embracing
as
they
do
all
the
best
features
of
temperance
and
frugality
what
is
the
use
of
for
ever
preaching
about
the
avoidance
of
luxuries
and
stimulants
if
you
rule
out
of
your
system
the
one
dietary
which
makes
stimulants
and
luxuries
impossible
the
relation
of
vegetarianism
to
temperance
of
the
food
question
to
the
drink
question
is
that
of
the
greater
which
includes
the
less
footnote
may
but
it
is
when
we
turn
from
philanthropy
to
zoophily
and
to
the
questions
more
particularly
affecting
the
welfare
of
animals
that
the
importance
of
vegetarianism
in
spite
of
the
stubborn
attempts
of
the
animal
lovers
to
overlook
it
is
most
marked
here
again
i
do
not
share
the
extreme
vegetarian
view
that
food
reform
is
the
of
other
reforms
for
i
think
it
can
be
shown
that
all
cruelties
to
animals
whether
inflicted
in
the
interests
of
the
the
laboratory
the
or
any
other
institution
are
the
outcome
of
one
and
the
same
blindness
which
can
see
no
unity
and
kinship
but
only
difference
and
division
between
the
human
and
the
race
this
blindness
it
crass
denial
of
a
common
origin
a
common
nature
a
common
structure
and
common
pleasures
and
has
alone
hardened
men
in
all
ages
of
the
world
civilised
or
barbarous
to
inflict
such
fiendish
outrages
on
their
harmless
and
to
remove
this
blindness
we
need
it
seems
to
me
a
deeper
and
more
radical
remedy
than
the
reform
of
sport
or
of
physiological
methods
or
even
of
diet
alone
the
only
real
cure
for
the
evil
is
the
growing
sense
that
the
lower
animals
are
closely
akin
to
us
and
have
rights
and
here
we
see
the
inevitable
logic
of
vegetarianism
if
our
belief
in
the
rights
of
animals
is
ever
to
quit
the
stage
of
theory
and
enter
the
stage
of
fact
for
just
as
there
can
be
no
human
rights
where
there
is
slavery
so
there
can
be
no
animal
rights
where
there
is
eating
of
flesh
to
keep
a
man
slave
or
servant
says
edward
carpenter
for
your
own
advantage
merely
to
keep
an
animal
that
you
may
it
is
a
lie
you
can
not
look
that
man
or
animal
in
the
face
i
am
not
saying
that
it
is
not
a
good
thing
that
quite
apart
from
food
reform
should
be
denouncing
the
doings
of
the
scientific
inquisition
while
humanitarians
of
another
school
are
exposing
the
horrors
of
sport
for
cruelty
is
a
monster
and
there
must
at
times
be
a
concentration
of
energy
on
a
particular
spot
but
i
do
say
that
any
reasoned
principle
of
kindness
to
animals
which
leaves
vegetarianism
outside
its
scope
is
in
the
very
nature
of
things
foredoomed
to
failure
footnote
take
for
example
the
rule
to
which
some
bind
themselves
to
wear
no
feathers
but
those
of
birds
killed
for
food
one
is
reminded
of
thomas
paine
epigram
they
pity
the
plumage
but
forget
the
dying
bird
vegetarianism
is
an
essential
part
of
any
true
zoophily
and
the
reason
why
it
is
not
more
generally
recognised
as
such
is
the
same
as
that
which
excludes
it
from
the
plan
of
the
it
is
so
upsetting
to
the
habits
of
the
average
man
few
of
us
comparatively
care
to
murder
birds
in
sport
and
still
fewer
to
cut
up
living
animals
in
the
supposed
interests
of
science
but
we
have
all
been
taught
to
regard
flesh
food
as
a
necessity
and
it
is
a
matter
at
first
of
some
effort
and
to
rid
ourselves
of
complicity
in
butchering
herein
is
at
once
the
strength
and
the
weakness
of
the
case
for
strength
as
regards
its
logic
and
the
weakness
as
regards
its
it
makes
more
direct
personal
demand
on
the
earnestness
of
its
believers
than
other
forms
of
zoophily
do
for
which
reason
there
is
a
widespread
though
perhaps
unconscious
tendency
among
zoophilists
to
evade
it
yet
that
such
evasion
is
a
blunder
may
be
seen
from
the
outcry
raised
against
it
not
by
vegetarians
only
but
by
the
vivisectionists
and
sportsmen
themselves
who
are
quick
to
ask
the
zoophilists
why
if
they
are
so
eager
for
the
of
the
animals
they
do
not
desist
from
eating
question
which
however
insincere
in
the
mouths
of
some
who
propound
it
must
at
least
be
allowed
to
be
logical
for
it
is
simple
truth
that
though
vivisection
is
a
more
refined
and
diabolical
torture
and
sport
a
more
stupidly
wanton
one
the
of
suffering
that
results
from
the
practice
of
is
greater
and
more
disastrous
than
either
and
by
being
so
familiarly
paraded
in
our
streets
is
a
cause
of
wider
demoralisation
when
one
thinks
of
the
aimless
and
stunted
life
as
well
as
the
barbarous
death
of
the
wretched
victims
of
the
bred
as
they
are
for
no
better
purpose
than
to
be
unnaturally
fattened
for
the
table
it
makes
one
marvel
that
so
many
kindly
folk
keenly
sensitive
to
the
cruelties
inflicted
elsewhere
should
be
utterly
deaf
and
blind
to
the
doings
of
their
family

to
quote
the
famous
lines
of
coleridge
he
prayeth

great
and
small
but
what
kind
of

is

its
affection
there
are
hidden
rocks
in
that
poetical
passage
which
a
sense
of
humour
should

the
pilot

our
position
therefore
is
while
we
make
no
exaggerated
claim
for
vegetarianism
as
in
itself
a
panacea
for
human
ills
and
animal
sufferings
we
insist
on
the
rational
view
that
reform
of
diet
is
an
indispensable
branch
of
social
organisation
and
that
it
is
idle
to
talk
of
recognising
rights
of

so
long
as

vegetarianism
is
no
more
and
no

than
an
essential
part
in
the
highly
complex
engine

conclusion
the
chief
object
of
this
work
as
stated
at
the
outset
has
been
to
prove
the
logical
soundness
of
vegetarian
principles
and
the
hollowness
of
the
hackneyed
taunt
so
often
a
makeshift
for
reasoning
that
vegetarians
are
a
crew
of
mild
brainless
enthusiasts
whose
hearts
are
better
than
their
heads
how
far
i
have
been
successful
in
this
purpose
it
is
for
the
reader
to
judge
i

it
has
at

been
made
plain
that
if
it
is
logic
that
our
friends
are
in
need
of
we
are
quite
ready
to
accommodate
them
and
that
nothing
will
please
us
better
than
a
thorough
intellectual
sifting
of
the
whole
problem
of
diet
only
it
must
be
a
sifting
the
great
foe
of
vegetarianism
as
of
every
other
reform
is
inert
blind
dogged
force
which
time
called
into
being
and
time
only
can
it
is
this
which
lurks
behind
the
flimsy
sophisms
and
excuses
that
the
loves
to
set
up
in
which
as
a
rule
though
there
is
much
show
of
controversy
there
is
little
real
discussion
to
those
of
our
opponents
who
honestly
wish
to
grapple
with
the
question
of
diet
and
to
understand
what
vegetarianism
means
whether
they
agree
with
it
or
not
i
submit
that
the
following
points
have
at
any
rate
been
clearly
set
before
them
that
the
objections
raised
to
the
name
vegetarian
are
founded
on
sheer
ignorance
of
the
word
origin
and
calculated
if
not
designed
to
distract
attention
from
the
substance
by
fixing
it
on
the
shadow
it
is
not
nowadays
seriously
denied
by
any
responsible
authority
that
a
vegetable
diet
the
addition
of
eggs
and
is
quite
adequate
for
nutriment
but
the
method
is
allow
what
is
said
rightly
or
wrongly
of
the
sufficiency
of
a
vegetable
diet
to
be
misunderstood
by
the
public
as
referring
to
vegetarianism
thus
burney
yeo
in
his
food
in
health
and
disease
first
argues
that
vegetarians
have
no
right
to
their
title
because
they
consume
animal
products
and
then
proceeds
to
allege
various
reasons
against
a
purely
vegetable
diet
which
by
his
own
showing
is
not
what
vegetarianism
represents
this
is
a
fair
sample
of
logic
that
the
immediate
aim
of
vegetarians
is
not
that
which
under
various
forms
is
so
industriously
foisted
on
a
desire
to
attain
at
one
step
to
the
millennium
by
altogether
ceasing
to
take
the
life
of
animals
or
by
entire
abstinence
from
animal
rather
it
is
a
practical
intelligible
though
necessarily
imperfect
attempt
to
humanise
as
far
as
may
be
the
present
sanguinary
diet
system
by
the
omission
at
least
of
its
more
loathsome
and
barbarous
features
that
vegetarianism
if
once
admitted
to
be
practicable
offers
certain
positive
benefits
of
the
utmost
value
humane
æsthetic
hygienic
social
economic
while
on
the
other
hand
the
denials
that
have
hitherto
been
made
of
its
practicability
on
the
plea
of
structure
laws
of
nature
climate
digestion
and
so
forth
are
far
too
weak
and
illogical
to
bear
the
test
of
criticism
there
of
course
be
some
conclusive
reason
against
vegetarianism
but
if
so
why
is
its
production
delayed
that
in
the
greater
number
of
the
arguments
brought
against
vegetarianism
the
importance
of
the
aspect
of
the
question
is
studiously
kept
out
of
sight
thus
sir
henry
thompson
in
his
article
of
while
admitting
the
possibility
of
abstaining
from
flesh
foods
gave
judgment
on
the
whole
in
favour
of
a
moderate
use
of
without
allowing
the
smallest
weight
to
humane
or
moral
considerations
writing
on
the
same
subject
in
he
so
far
repaired
this
oversight
as
to
argue
that
it
is
really
kinder
to
eat
animals
than
not
to
do
so
because
otherwise
they
would
not
be
bred
at
all
that
is
the
amount
of
attention
the
moral
side
of
vegetarianism
receives
from
its
opponents
a
great
humane
issue
being
set
aside
by
a
sophism
more
suited
for
a
savoy
comedy
than
for
serious
discussion
but
there
is
the
further
as
far
as
these
chapters
are
concerned
the
final
if
vegetarianism
is
part
and
parcel
of
a
genuine
progressive
movement
does
it
not
more
rapidly
progress
why
so
little
from
your
propaganda
is
the
frequent
sneer
of
the
and
the
vegetarian
himself
is
sometimes
fain
to
be
at
the
seeming
slowness
of
his
advance
does
vegetarianism
progress
yes
and
no
according
to
the
expectations
reasonable
or
unreasonable
that
its
supporters
have
been
cherishing
if
we
have
fondly
hoped
to
witness
in
the
future
the
triumph
of
the
humaner
living
it
must
be
allowed
that
the
actual
rate
of
progress
is
extremely
disheartening
but
if
on
the
contrary
we
work
under
a
rational
understanding
that
a
widespread
change
of
diet
like
any
other
radical
change
is
a
matter
not
of
years
but
of
centuries
then
we
shall
not
find
in
the
slow
growth
of
our
movement
any
reason
for
dissatisfaction
revolution
in
personal
habits
be
it
remembered
is
even
more
difficult
than
revolution
in
political
forms
and
needs
a
greater
time
for
its
fulfilment
and
looked
at
in
this
light
vegetarianism
has
made
as
much
progress
during
the
past
as
any
other
cause
which
aims
at
so
a
change
but
what
of
the
many
individual
failures
it
is
asked
among
those
who
make
trial
of
vegetarianism
taking
the
circumstances
into
account
the
failures
can
not
be
regarded
as
numerous
for
in
every
such
movement
there
are
people
who
are
impelled
by
motives
of
restlessness
and
curiosity
rather
than
of
real
conviction
and
in
view
of
the
personal
obstacles
that
beset
the
path
of
the
vegetarian
it
is
not
surprising
that
in
food
reform
as
in
drink
reform
there
are
a
certain
number
of
backsliders
in
an
ordinary
household
every
possible
influence
social
and
domestic
is
brought
to
bear
on
the
heretic
who
abstains
from
flesh
foods
anxious
relatives
and
indignant
friends
adjure
him
to
remember
the
duty
he
owes
to
himself
and
to
his
family
and
urge
him
for
the
sake
of
those
dear
to
him
if
not
for
his
own
to
return
to
that
great
sacramental
bond
of
union
between
man
and
eating
of
our
is
he
smitten
by
one
of
the
numberless
ailments
that
are
the
of
the
physician
and
of
which
are
daily
the
victims
in
every
part
of
the
world
the
doctor
looks
wise
shakes
his
head
and
informs
a
sorrowing
circle
that
it
is
the
direct
result
of
his
vegetarianism
above
all
the
fear
of
ridicule
acting
on
the
natural
unwillingness
of
mankind
to
venture
along
unknown
paths
is
a
strong
deterrent
for
there
are
still
many
persons
to
whom
the
idea
of
abstinence
from
butchers
meat
is
positively
a
matter
for
merriment
and
it
seems
fated
that
vegetarianism
like
every
new
principle
must
be
a
target
for
such
shafts
well
so
be
it
we
know
that
the
struggle
will
be
a
long
one
and
if
vegetarianism
has
got
to
run
the
blockade
of
noodledom
and
a
huge
amount
of
foolish
talk
must
perforce
be
fired
off
the
sooner
the
battle
commences
and
the
sooner
it
is
concluded
the
better
for
all
concerned
and
ridicule
as
the
will
learn
is
a
weapon
which
can
be
wielded
by
more
parties
than
one
for
to
be
frank
the
dietists
of
the
kreophagist
school
have
talked
and
are
talking
a
great
deal
of
downright
nonsense
in
their
tirades
against
vegetarianism
and
the
only
reason
why
they
have
not
been
more
widely
brought
to
book
is
that
they
speak
in
orthodox
quarters
where
no
reply
is
permitted
the
oracle
of
course
must
not
be
answered
or
criticised
so
far
as
they
have
condescended
to
state
a
case
against
food
reform
it
is
a
case
which
would
be
laughed
out
of
court
as
a
string
of
quibbles
and
absurdities
in
any
open
discussion
for
the
specialist
that
most
humourless
of
persons
is
apt
to
forget
that
the
moment
he
quits
the
ground
on
which
he
has
made
himself
a
master
and
such
ground
has
very
narrow
limitations
he
is
no
longer
infallible
and
that
if
he
thinks
to
exorcise
modern
feeling
by
the
repetition
of
ancient
formulas
he
will
only
make
himself
ridiculous
and
as
a
matter
of
pure
humour
apart
from
humanity
which
is
the
more
man
who
can
live
in
simple
affluence
on
a
supply
of
food
which
is
as
little
costly
to
himself
as
it
is
burdensome
to
others
or
he
who
can
not
be
content
unless
he
gluts
an
ogreish
appetite
on
animals
slaughtered
for
his
larder
and
then
pharisaically
pretends
that
he
has
done
them
a
kindness
by
eating
them
it
is
custom
and
custom
thraldom
of
that
ceaseless
round
of
mutton
and
beef
to
which
the
dead
level
of
civilisation
reduces
us
prevents
civilised
men
from
seeing
the
essential
silliness
of
maintaining
the
diet
of
savages
footnote
richard
jefferies
field
and
hedgerows
that
a
percentage
of
those
who
make
trial
of
vegetarianism
should
return
to
their
former
habit
is
in
accordance
with
what
always
happens
in
the
fight
between
the
new
and
the
old
and
at
the
is
in
the
rare
cases
where
such
trial
has
been
a
genuine
only
that
a
change
of
diet
is
much
more
difficult
for
some
persons
than
it
is
for
others
a
fact
which
all
rational
food
reformers
have
recognised
but
from
the
force
of
testimony
there
is
no
escape
when
as
in
the
case
of
vegetarianism
successfully
practised
and
yielding
the
best
results
the
instances
are
drawn
from
every
rank
and
temperament
and
are
amply
sufficient
in
number
to
prove
the
experience
trustworthy
it
is
idle
to
go
on
asserting
that
a
thing
can
not
be
done
when
you
are
face
to
face
with
some
thousands
of
people
who
not
only
have
done
it
but
are
happier
and
healthier
in
consequence
with
the
question
of
the
right
choice
of
food
and
how
to
adopt
vegetarianism
i
am
not
here
concerned
such
information
is
readily
accessible
in
current
vegetarian
literature
but
it
must
be
said
in
this
is
the
thought
which
above
all
others
i
would
leave
in
the
mind
of
the
the
surest
warrant
of
success
in
the
reform
of
diet
is
a
sincere
belief
in
the
moral
rightness
of
the
cause
the
in
which
one
takes
up
vegetarianism
is
the
main
factor
in
the
result
it
is
useless
to
look
for
any
absolute
proof
in
such
proof
is
in
one
those
at
least
who
have
heart
to
feel
and
brain
to
ponder
the
cruelty
and
folly
of
it
is
an
issue
where
logic
is
as
wholly
on
the
one
side
as
habit
is
wholly
on
the
other
and
where
habit
is
as
certainly
the
shield
of
barbarism
as
logic
is
the
sword

humaneness
