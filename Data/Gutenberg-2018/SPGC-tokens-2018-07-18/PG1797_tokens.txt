first
citizen
we

accounted
poor
citizens
the
patricians
good
what
authority
surfeits
on
would
relieve
us
if
they
would
yield
us
but
the
superfluity
while
it
were
wholesome
we
might
guess
they
relieved
us
humanely
but
they
think
we
are
too
dear
the
leanness
that
afflicts
us
the
object
of
our
misery
is
as
an
inventory
to
particularize
their
abundance
our
sufferance
is
a
gain
to
them
let
us
revenge
this
with
our
pikes
ere
we
become
rakes
for
the

maliciously
first

i
say
unto
you
what

hath
done

it
to
that
end
though
men
can
be
content
to
say
it
was
for
his
country
he
did
it
to
please
his
mother
and
to
be
partly
proud
which
he
is
even
to
the
altitude
of
his
virtue
second
citizen
what
he
can
not
help
in
his
nature
you
account
a
vice
in

must
in
no
way
say
he
is
covetous
first

not
i
need
not
be
barren

this
dearth

strike
at

heaven

your
staves

them
against
the
roman
state
whose
course
will
on
the
way
it
takes
cracking
ten
thousand
curbs
of
more
strong
link
asunder
than
can
ever
appear
in
your
impediment
for
the
dearth
the
gods
not
the
patricians
make
it
and
your
knees
to
them
not
arms

calamity
thither
where
more

you
like
fathers

you
curse
them
as
enemies
first
citizen

for
us
true
indeed
they
car
for
us
yet
suffer
us
to
famish
and
their
storehouses
cramm
with
grain
make
edicts
for
usury
to
support
usurers
repeal
daily
any
wholesome
act
established
against
the
rich
and
provide
more
piercing
statutes
daily
to
chain
up
and
restrain
the
poor
if
the
wars
eat
us
not
up
they
will
and
there
all
the
love
they
bear
us

confess
yourselves
wondrous
malicious
or
be
accus
of
folly

shall
tell
you
a
pretty
tale
it
may
be
you
have
heard
it
but
since
it
serves
my
purpose
i
will
venture
to
a
little
more
first
citizen
well

you
must
not
think
to
fob
off
our
disgrace
with
a
tale
but

please

deliver
menenius
there
was
a
time
when
all
the
body
members
rebell
against
the
belly
thus
accus
it
that
only
like
a
gulf
it
did
remain
i
th
midst
o
th
body
idle
and
unactive
still
cupboarding
the
viand
never
bearing
like
labour
with
the
rest
where
th
other
instruments
did
see
and
hear
devise
instruct
walk
feel
and
mutually
participate
did
minister
unto
the
appetite
and
affection
common
of
the
whole
body
the
belly

citizen
well

what
answer
made
the
belly
menenius

shall
tell
you
with
a
kind
of
smile
which
came
from
the
lungs
but
even
for
look
you
i
may
make
the
belly
smile
as
well
as
it
tauntingly
replied
to
th
discontented
members
the
mutinous
parts
that
envied
his
receipt
even
so
most
fitly
as
you
malign
our
senators
for
that
they
are
not
such
as

belly

blood
even
to
the
court

heart
to
th
seat

vented
their

one

that
will
put

i
sin
in
envying
his
nobility
and
were

anything
but
what
i

i
would

menenius
o

lead

cominius
we
must

worthy
your

cominius
noble
marcius
first

to
the
citizens
hence
to
your

be
gone
marcius
nay
let

follow
the
volsces
have

take
these

to
gnaw
their

worshipful
mutineers
your
valour
puts
well
forth
pray
follow
ciitzens
steal
away
exeunt
all
but
sicinius
and
brutus
sicinius
was
ever
man
so
proud
as
is
this
marcius
brutus
he
has
no
equal
sicinius
when
we
were
chosen
tribunes
for
the
brutus
mark
you
his
lip
and
eyes
sicinius
nay
but
his
taunts
brutus
being
mov
he
will
not
spare
to
gird
the
gods
sicinius
bemock
the
modest
moon
brutus
the
present
wars
devour
him
he
is
grown
too
proud
to
be
so
valiant
sicinius
such
a
nature
tickled
with
good
success
disdains
the
shadow
which
he
treads
on
at
noon
but
i
do
wonder
his
insolence
can
brook
to
be
commanded
under
cominius
brutus
fame
at
the
which
he
in
whom
already
he
is
well
can
not
better
be
held
nor
more
attain
than
by
a
place
below
the
first
for
what
miscarries
shall
be
the
general
fault
though
he
perform
to
th
utmost
of
a
man
and
giddy
censure
will
then
cry
out
of
marcius
if
he
had
borne
the
business
sicinius
besides
if
things
go
well
opinion
that
so
sticks
on
marcius
shall
of
his
demerits
rob
cominius
brutus
come
half
all
cominius
honours
are
to
marcius
though
marcius
earn
them
not
and
all
his
faults
to
marcius
shall
be
honours
though
indeed
in
aught
he
merit
not
sicinius
let
hence
and
hear
how
the
dispatch
is
made
and
in
what
fashion
more
than
his
singularity
he
goes
upon
this
present
action
brutus
let
along
exeunt
scene
ii
corioli
the
senate
house
enter
tullus
aufidius
with
senators
of
corioli
first
senator
so
your
opinion
is
aufidius
that
they
of
rome
are
in
our
counsels
and
know
how
we
proceed
aufidius
is
it
not
yours
what
ever
have
been
thought
on
in
this
state
that
could
be
brought
to
bodily
act
ere
rome
had
circumvention
is
not
four
days
gone
since
i
heard
thence
these
are
the
i
think
i
have
the
letter
here
yes
here
it
is
reads
have
press
a
power
but
it
is
not
known
whether
for
east
or
west
the
dearth
is
great
the
people
mutinous
and
it
is
rumour
cominius
marcius
your
old
enemy
who
is
of
rome
worse
hated
than
of
you
and
titus
lartius
a
most
valiant
roman
these
three
lead
on
this
preparation
whither
is
bent
most
likely
is
for
you
consider
of
it
first
senator
our
army
in
the
field
we
never
yet
made
doubt
but
rome
was
ready
to
answer
us
aufidius
nor
did
you
think
it
folly
to
keep
your
great
pretences
veil
till
when
they
needs
must
show
themselves
which
in
the
hatching
it
seem
appear
to
rome
by
the
discovery
we
shall
be
in
our
aim
which
was
to
take
in
many
towns
ere

more
comfortable
sort
if
my
son
were
my
husband
i
should
freelier
rejoice
in
that
absence
wherein
he
won
honour
than
in
the
embracements
of
his
bed
where
he
would
show
most
love
when
yet
he
was
but
and
the
only
son
of
my
womb
when
youth
with
comeliness
pluck
all
gaze
his
way
when
for
a
day
of
kings
entreaties
a
mother
should
not
sell
him
an
hour
from

considering
how
honour
would
become
such
a
that
it
was
no
better
than
to
hang
by

if
renown
made
it
not
was
pleas
to
let
him
seek
danger
where
he
was

how
long

messenger
above
an

my

briefly
we
heard
their

how
couldst
thou
in

confound
an

bring
thy

so
late

spies
of

held
me
in

late
cominius
the

more
than
i
know
the

from

marcius
come
i
too
late
cominius
ay
if
you
come
not
in
the
blood
of
others
but
mantled
in
your
own
marcius
o
let
me
clip
ye
in
arms
as
sound
as
when
i
woo
in
heart
as
merry
as
when
our
nuptial
day
was
done
and
tapers
burn
to
bedward
cominius
flower
of

how
with
titus
lartius
marcius
as
with
a
man
busied
about
decrees
condemning
some
to
death
and
some
to
exile
ransoming
him
or
pitying
th
other
holding
corioli
in
the
name
of
rome
even
like
a
fawning
greyhound
in
the
leash
to
let
him
slip
at
will
cominius
where
is
that
slave
which
told
me
they
had
beat
you
to
your
trenches
where
is
he
call
him
hither
marcius
let
him
alone
he
did
inform
the
truth
but
for
our
gentlemen
the
common
a
plague
tribunes
for
them
the
mouse
shunn
the
cat
as
they
did
budge
from
rascals
worse
than
they
cominius
but
how
prevail
you
marcius
will
the
time
serve
to
tell
i
do
not
think
where
is
the
enemy
are
you
lords
o
th
field
if
not
why
cease
you
till
you
are
so
cominius
marcius
we
have
at

fought

our

marcius
how
lies
their
battle
know
you
on
which
side
they
have
plac
their
men
of
trust
cominius
as
i
guess
marcius
their
bands
i
th
vaward
are
the
antiates
of
their
best
trust
them
aufidius
their
very
heart
of
hope
marcius
i
do
beseech
you
by
all
the
battles
wherein
we
have
fought
by
th
blood
we
have
shed
together
by
th
vows
we
have
made
to
endure
friends
that
you
directly
set
me
against
aufidius
and
his
antiates
and
that
you
not
delay
the
present
but
filling
the
air
with
swords
advanc
and
darts
we
prove
this
very
hour
cominius
though
i
could
wish
you
were
conducted
to
a
gentle
bath
and
balms
applied
to
you
yet
dare
i
never
deny
your
asking
take
your
choice
of
those
that
best
can
aid
your
action
marcius
those
are
they
that
most
are
willing
if
any
such
be
as
it
were
sin
to
that
love
this
painting
wherein
you
see
me
smear
if
any
fear
lesser
his
person
than
an
ill
report
if
any
think
brave
death
outweighs
bad
life
and

tells

we
shall
have
news
tonight
brutus
good
or

menenius
not
according
to
the
prayer
of
the
people
for
they
love
not
marcius
sicinius
nature
teaches
beasts
to
know
their

menenius
pray
you
who
does
the
wolf
love
sicinius
the
lamb
menenius
ay
to
devour
him
as
the
hungry
plebeians
would
the
noble
marcius
brutus
he
a
lamb
indeed
that
baas
like
a
bear
menenius
he
a
bear
indeed
that
lives
like
a
lamb
you
two
are
old
men
tell
me
one
thing
that
i
shall
ask
you
both
tribunes
well
sir
menenius
in
what
enormity
is
marcius
poor
in
that
you
two
have
not
in
abundance
brutus
he
poor
in
no
one
fault
but
stor
with
all
sicinius
especially
in
pride
brutus
and
topping
all
others
in
boasting
menenius
this
is
strange
now
do
you
two
know
how
you
are
censured
here
in
the
i
mean
of
us
o
th
file
do
you
both
tribunes
why
how
are
we
censur
menenius
because
you
talk
of
pride
will
you
not
be
angry
both
tribunes
well
well
sir
well
menenius
why
is
no
great
matter
for
a
very
little
thief
of
occasion
will
rob
you
of
a
great
deal
of
patience
give
your
dispositions
the
reins
and
be
angry
at
your
at
the
least
if
you
take
it
as
a
pleasure
to
you
in
being
so
you
blame
marcius
for
being
proud
brutus
we
do
it
not
alone
sir
menenius
i
know
you
can
do
very
little
alone
for
your
helps
are
many
or
else
your
actions
would
grow
wondrous
single
your
abilities
are
too
for
doing
much
alone
you
talk
of
pride
o
that
you
could
turn
your
eyes
toward
the
napes
of
your
necks
and
make
but
an
interior
survey
of
your
good
selves
o
that
you
could
both
tribunes
what
then
sir
menenius
why
then
you
should
discover
a
brace
of
unmeriting
proud
violent
testy
as
any
in
rome
sicinius
menenius
you
are
known
well
enough
too
menenius
i
am
known
to
be
a
humorous
patrician
and
one
that
loves
a
cup
of
hot
wine
with
not
a
drop
of
allaying
tiber
i
said
to
be
something
imperfect
in
favouring
the
first
complaint
hasty
and
upon
too
trivial
motion
one
that
converses
more
with
the
buttock
of
the
night
than
with
the
forehead
of
the
morning
what
i
think
i
utter
and
spend
my
malice
in
my
breath
meeting
two
such
wealsmen
as
you
i
can
not
call
you
if
the
drink
you
give
me
touch
my
palate
adversely
i
make
a
crooked
face
at
it
i
can
not
say
your
worships
have
deliver
the
matter
well
when
i
find
the
ass
in
compound
with
the
major
part
of
your
syllables
and
though
i
must
be
content
to
bear
with
those
that
say
you
are
reverend
grave
men
yet
they
lie
deadly
that
tell
you
you
have
good
faces
if
you
see
this
in
the
map
of
my
microcosm
follows
it
that
i
am
known
well
enough
too
what
harm
can
your
bisson
conspectuities
glean
out
of
this
character
if
i
be
known
well
enough
too
brutus
come
sir
come
we
know
you
well
enough
menenius
you
know
neither
me
yourselves
nor
any
thing
you
are
ambitious
for
poor
knaves
caps
and
legs
you
wear
out
a
good
wholesome
forenoon
in
hearing
a
cause
between
an
and
a
and
then
rejourn
the
controversy
of
threepence
to
a
second
day
of
audience
when
you
are
hearing
a
matter
between
party
and
party
if
you
chance
to
be
pinch
with
the
colic
you
make
faces
like
mummers
set
up
the
bloody
flag
against
all
patience
and
in
roaring
for
a
dismiss
the
controversy
bleeding
the
more
entangled
by
your
hearing
all
the
peace
you
make
in
their
cause
is
calling
both
the
parties
knaves
you
are
a
pair
of
strange
ones
brutus
come
come
you
are
well
understood
to
be
a
perfecter
giber
for
the
table
than
a
necessary
bencher
in
the
capitol
menenius
our
very
priests
must
become
mockers
if
they
shall
encounter
such
ridiculous
subjects
as
you
are
when
you
speak
best
unto
the
purpose
it
is
not
worth
the
wagging
of
your
beards
and
your
beards
deserve
not
so
honourable
a
grave
as
to
stuff
a
botcher
cushion
or
to
be
entomb
in
an
yet
you
must
be
saying
marcius
is
proud
who
in
a
cheap
estimation
is
worth
all
your
predecessors
since
deucalion
though
peradventure
some
of
the
best
of
were
hereditary
hangmen
to
your
worships
more
of
your
conversation
would
infect
my
brain
being
the
herdsmen
of
the
beastly
plebeians
i
will
be
bold
to
take
my
leave

cominius
on

capitol
flourish
cornets
exeunt
in
state
as
before
brutus
and
sicinius
come
forward
brutus
all
tongues
speak
of
him
and
the
bleared
sights
are
spectacled
to
see
him
your
prattling
nurse
into
a
rapture
lets
her
baby
cry
while
she

him
the

the

him
stalls
bulks

are
smother
up
leads
fill
and
ridges
with
variable
complexions
all
agreeing
in
earnestness
to
see
him
flamens
do
press
among
the
popular
throngs
and
puff
to
win
a
vulgar
station
our
veil
dames
commit
the
war
of

and

in
their
nicely
gawded
cheeks
to
th
wanton
spoil
of
phoebus
burning
kisses
such
a
pother
as
if
that
whatsoever
god
who
leads
him
were
slily
crept
into
his
human
powers
and
gave
him
graceful
posture
sicinius
on
the
sudden
i
warrant
him
consul
brutus
then
our
office
may
during
his
power
go
sleep
sicinius
he
can
not
transport
his
honours
from
where
he
should
begin
and
end
but
will
lose
those
he
hath
won
brutus
in
that
there
comfort
sicinius
doubt
not
the
commoners
for
whom
we
stand
but
they
upon
their
ancient
malice
will
forget
with
the
least
cause
these
his
new
honours
which
that
he
will
give
them
make
our
as
little
question
as
he
is
proud
to
brutus
i
heard
him
swear
were
he
to
stand
for
consul
never
would
he
appear
i
th
nor
on
him
put
the
napless
vesture
of
humility
nor
showing
as
the
manner
is
his
wounds
to
th
people
beg
their
stinking
breaths
sicinius
is
right
brutus
it
was
his
word
o
he
would
miss
it
rather
than
carry
it
but
by
the
suit
of
the
gentry
to
him
and
the
desire
of
the
nobles
sicinius
i
wish
no
better
than
have
him
hold
that
purpose
and
to
put
it
in
execution
brutus
is
most
like
he
will
sicinius
it
shall
be
to
him
then
as
our
good
wills
a
sure
destruction
brutus
so
it
must
fall
out
to
him
or
our
authorities
for
an
end
we
must
suggest
the
people
in
what
hatred
he
still
hath
held
them
that
to
power
he
would
have
made
them
mules
silenc
their
pleaders
and
dispropertied
their
freedoms
holding
them
in
human
action
and
capacity
of
no
more
soul
nor
fitness
for
the
world
than
camels
in
their
war
who
have
their
provand
only
for
bearing
burdens
and
sore
blows
for
sinking
under
them
sicinius
this
as
you
say
suggested
at
some
time
when
his
soaring
insolence
shall
touch
the
which
time
shall
not
want
if
he
be
put
upo
and
that
as
easy
as
to
set
dogs
on
will
be
his
fire
to
kindle
their
dry
stubble
and
their
blaze
shall
darken
him
for
ever
enter
a
messenger
brutus
what
the
matter
messenger
you
are
sent
for
to
the
capitol
is
thought
that
marcius
shall
be
consul
i
have
seen
the
dumb
men
throng
to
see
him
and
the
blind
to
hear
him
speak
matrons
flung
gloves
ladies
and
maids
their
scarfs
and
handkerchers
upon
him
as
he
pass
the
nobles
bended
as
to
jove
statue
and
the
commons
made
a
shower
and
thunder
with
their
caps
and
shouts
i
never
saw
the
like
brutus
let
to
the
capitol
and
carry
with
us
ears
and
eyes
for
th
time
but
hearts
for
the
event
sicinius
have
with
you
exeunt
scene
ii
rome
the
capitol
enter
two
officers
to
lay
cushions
as
it
were
in
the
capitol
first
officer
come
come
they
are
almost
here
how
many
stand
for
consulships
second
officer
three
they
say
but
is
thought
of
every
one
coriolanus
will
carry
it
first
officer
that
a
brave
fellow
but
he
vengeance
proud
and
loves
not
the
common
people
second
officer
faith
there
have
been
many
great
men
that
have
flatter
the
people
who
loved
them
and
there
be
many
that
they
have
loved
they
know
not
wherefore
so
that
if
they
love
they
know
not
why
they
hate
upon
no
better
a
ground
therefore
for
coriolanus
neither
to
care
whether
they
love
or
hate
him
manifests
the
true
knowledge
he
has
in
their
disposition
and
out
of
his
noble
carelessness
lets
them
plainly
first
officer
if
he
did
not
care
whether
he
had
their
love
or
no
he
waved
indifferently
doing
them
neither
good
nor
harm
but
he
seeks
their
hate
with
greater
devotion
than
they
can
render
it
him
and
leaves
nothing
undone
that
may
fully
discover
him
their
opposite
now
to
seem
to
affect
the
malice
and
displeasure
of
the
people
is
as
bad
as
that
which
he
to
flatter
them
for
their
love
second
officer
he
hath
deserved
worthily
of
his
country
and
his
ascent
is
not
by
such
easy
degrees
as
those
who
having
been
supple
and
courteous
to
the
people
bonneted
without
any
further
deed
to
have
them
at
all
into
their
estimation
and
report
but
he
hath
so
planted
his
honours
in
their
eyes
and
his
actions
in
their
hearts
that
for
their
tongues
to
be
silent
and
not
confess
so
much
were
a
kind
of
ingrateful
injury
to
report
otherwise
were
a
malice
that
giving
itself
the
lie
would
pluck
reproof
and
rebuke
from
every
ear
that
heard
it
first
officer
no
more
of
him
he
a
worthy
man
make
way
they
are
coming
a
sennet
enter
the
patricians
and
the
tribunes
of
the
people
lictors
before
them
coriolanus
menenius
cominius
the
consul
sicinius
and
brutus
take
their
places
by
themselves
coriolanus
stands
menenius
having
determin
of
the
volsces
and
to
send
for
titus
lartius
it
remains
as
the
main
point
of
this
our
to
gratify
his
noble
service
that
hath
thus
stood
for
his
country
therefore
please
you
most
reverend
and
grave
elders
to
desire
the
present
consul
and
last
general
in
our
successes
to
report
a
little
of
that
worthy
work
by
caius
marcius
coriolanus
whom
we
met
here
both
to
thank
and
to
remember
with
honours
like
himself
coriolanus
sits
first
senator
speak
good
cominius
leave
nothing
out
for
length
and
make
us
think
rather
our
state
defective
for
requital
than
we
to
stretch
it
out
masters
o
th
people
we
do
request
your
kindest
ears
and
after
your
loving
motion
toward
the
common
body
to
yield
what
passes
here
sicinius
we
are
convented
upon
a
pleasing
treaty
and
have
hearts
inclinable
to
honour
and
advance
the
theme
of
our
assembly
brutus
which
the
rather
we
shall
be
bless
to
do
if
he
remember
a
kinder
value
of
the
people
than
he
hath
hereto
priz
them
at
menenius
that
off
that
off
i
would
you
rather
had
been
silent
please
you
to
hear
cominius
speak
brutus
most
willingly
but
yet
my
caution
was
more
pertinent
than
the
rebuke
you
give
it
menenius
he
loves
your
people
but
tie
him
not
to
be
their
bedfellow
worthy
cominius
speak
coriolanus
rises
and
offers
to
go
away
nay
keep
your
place
first
senator
sit
coriolanus
never
shame
to
hear
what
you
have
nobly
done
coriolanus
your
honours
pardon
i
had
rather
have
my
wounds
to
heal
again
than
hear
say
how
i
got
them
brutus
sir
i
hope
my
words
disbench
you
not
coriolanus
no
sir
yet
oft
when
blows
have
made
me
stay
i
fled
from
words
you
sooth
not
therefore
hurt
not
but
your
people
i
love
them
as
they
menenius
pray
now
sit
down
coriolanus
i
had
rather
have
one
scratch
my
head
i
th
sun
when
the
alarum
were
struck
than
idly
sit
to
hear
my
nothings
monster
exit
menenius
masters
of
the
people
your
multiplying
spawn
how
can
he
that
thousand
to
one
good
when
you
now
see
he
had
rather
venture
all
his
limbs
for
honour
than
one
on
ears
to
hear
it
proceed
cominius
cominius
i
shall
lack
voice
the
deeds
of
coriolanus
should
not
be
utter
feebly
it
is
held
that
valour
is
the
chiefest
virtue
and
most
dignifies
the
haver
if
it
be
the
man
i
speak
of
can
not
in
the
world
be
singly
counterpois
at
sixteen
years
when
tarquin
made
a
head
for
rome
he
fought
beyond
the
mark
of
others
our
then
dictator
whom
with
all
praise
i
point
at
saw
him
fight
when
with
his
amazonian
chin
he
drove
the
bristled
lips
before
him
he
bestrid
an
roman
and
i
th
consul
view
slew
three
opposers
tarquin
self
he
met
and
struck
him
on
his
knee
in
that
day
feats
when
he
might
act
the
woman
in
the
scene
he
prov
best
man
i
th
field
and
for
his
meed
was
with
the
oak
his
pupil
age
thus
he
waxed
like
a
sea
and
in
the
brunt
of
seventeen
battles
since
he
lurch
all
swords
of
the
garland
for
this
last
before
and
in
corioli
let
me
say
i
can
not
speak
him
home
he
stopp
the
fliers
and
by
his
rare
example
made
the
coward
turn
terror
into
sport
as
weeds
before
a
vessel
under
sail
so
men
and
fell
below
his
stem
his
sword
death
stamp
where
it
did
mark
it
took
from
face
to
foot
he
was
a
thing
of
blood
whose
every
motion
was
tim
with
dying
cries
alone
he
the
mortal
gate
of
th
city
which
he
painted
with
shunless
destiny
aidless
came
off
and
with
a
sudden
struck
corioli
like
a
planet
now
all
his
when
by
and
by
the
din
of
war
pierce
his
ready
sense
then
straight
his
doubled
spirit
what
in
flesh
was
fatigate
and
to
the
battle
came
he
where
he
did
run
reeking
the
lives
of
men
as
if
a
perpetual
spoil
and
till
we
both
field
and
city
ours
he
never
stood
to
ease
his
breast
with
panting
menenius
worthy
man
first
senator
he
can
not
but
with
measure
fit
the
honours
which
we
devise
him
cominius
our
spoils
he
kick
at
and
look
upon
things
precious
as
they
were
the
common
muck
of
the
world
he
covets
less
than
misery
itself
would
give
rewards
his
deeds
with
doing
them
and
is
content
to
spend
the
time
to
end
it

acceptance
of
them
ingratitude
is
monstrous
and
for
the
multitude
to
be
ingrateful
were
to
make
a
monster
of
the
multitude
of
the
which
we
being
members
should
bring
ourselves
to
be
monstrous
members
first
citizen
and
to
make
us
no
better
thought
of
a
little
help
will
serve
for
once
we
stood
up
about
the
corn
he
himself
stuck
not
to
call
us
the
multitude
third
citizen
we
have
been
call
so
of
many
not
that
our
heads
are
some
brown
some
black
some
auburn
some
bald
but
that
our
wits
are
so
diversely
colour
and
truly
i
think
if
all
our
wits
were
to
issue
out
of
one
skull
they
would
fly
east
west
north
south
and
their
consent
of
one
direct
way
should
be
at
once
to
all
the
points
o
th
compass
second
citizen
think
you
so
which
way
do
you
judge
my
wit
would
fly
third
citizen
nay
your
wit
will
not
so
soon
out
as
another
is
strongly
wedg
up
in
a
but
if
it
were
at
liberty
sure
southward
second
citizen
why
that
way
third
citizen
to
lose
itself
in
a
fog
where
being
three
parts
melted
away
with
rotten
dews
the
fourth
would
return
for
conscience
sake
to
help
to
get
thee
a
wife
second
citizen
you
are
never
without
your
tricks
you
may
you
may
third
citizen
are
you
all
resolv
to
give
your
voices
but
no
matter
the
greater
part
carries
it
i
say
if
he
would
incline
to
the
people
there
was
never
a
worthier
man
enter
coriolanus
in
a
gown
of
humility
with
menenius
here
he
comes
and
in
the
gown
of
humility
mark
his
behaviour
we
are
not
to
stay
all
together
but
to
come
by
him
where
he
stands
by
ones
by
twos
and
by
threes
he
to
make
his
requests
by
particulars
wherein
every
one
of
us
has
a
single
honour
in
giving
him
our
own
voices
with
our
own
tongues
therefore
follow
me
and
i
direct
you
how
you
shall
go
by
him
all
content
content
exeunt
citizens
menenius
o
sir

not
known
the
worthiest
men

upo
i
can
not
bring
my
tongue
to
such
a
pace
sir

wounds

got

in
my
country
service
when
some
certain
of
your
brethren
roar
and
ran
from
th
noise
of
our
own
drums
menenius
o
me
the
gods
you
must
not
speak
of
that
you
must
desire
them
to
think
upon
you
coriolanus
think
upon
me
hang
i
would
they
would
forget
me
like
the
virtues
which
our
divines
lose
by
menenius
you
mar
all
i
leave
you
pray
you
speak
to
i
pray
you
in
wholesome
manner
exit
three
of
the
citizens
coriolanus
bid
them
wash
their
faces
and
keep
their
teeth
clean
so
here
comes
a
brace
you
know
the
cause
sir
of
my
standing
here
third
citizen
we
do
sir
tell
us
what
hath
brought
you
coriolanus
mine
own
desert
second
citizen
your
own
desert
coriolanus
ay
not
mine
own
desire
third
citizen
how
not
your
own
desire
coriolanus
no
sir
was
never
my
desire
yet
to
trouble
the
poor
with
begging
third
citizen
you
must
think
if
we
give
you
anything
we
hope
to
gain
by
you
coriolanus
well
then
i
pray
your
price
o
th
consulship
first
citizen
the
price
is
to
ask
it
kindly
coriolanus
kindly
sir
i
pray
let
me
i
have
wounds
to
show
you
which
shall
be
yours
in
private
your
good
voice
sir
what
say
you
second
citizen
you
shall
ha
it
worthy
sir
coriolanus
a
match
sir
there
in
all
two
worthy
voices
begg
i
have
your
alms
adieu
third
citizen
but
this
is
something
odd
second
citizen
an
to
give
but
is
no
matter
exeunt
the
three
citizens
two
other
citizens
coriolanus
pray
you
now
if
it
may
stand
with
the
tune
of
your
voices
that
i
may
be
consul
i
have
here
the
customary
gown
fourth
citizen
you
have
deserved
nobly
of
your
country
and
you
have
not
deserved
nobly
coriolanus
your
enigma
fourth
citizen
you
have
been
a
scourge
to
her
enemies
you
have
been
a
rod
to
her
friends
you
have
not
indeed
loved
the
common
people
coriolanus
you
should
account
me
the
more
virtuous
that
i
have
not
been
common
in
my
love
i
will
sir
flatter
my
sworn
brother
the
people
to
earn
a
dearer
estimation
of
them
a
condition
they
account
gentle
and
since
the
wisdom
of
their
choice
is
rather
to
have
my
hat
than
my
heart
i
will
practise
the
insinuating
nod
and
be
off
to
them
most
counterfeitly
that
is
sir
i
will
counterfeit
the
bewitchment
of
some
popular
man
and
give
it
bountiful
to
the
desirers
therefore
beseech
you
i
may
be
consul
fifth
citizen
we
hope
to
find
you
our
friend
and
therefore
give
you
our
voices
heartily
fourth
citizen
you
have
received
many
wounds
for
your
country
coriolanus
i
will
not
seal
your
knowledge
with
showing
them
i
will
make
much
of
your
voices
and
so
trouble
you
no
farther
both
citizens
the
gods
give
you
joy
sir
heartily
exeunt
citizens
coriolanus
most
sweet
voices
better
it
is
to
die
better
to
starve
than
crave
the
hire
which
first
we
do
deserve
why
in
this
wolvish
toge
should
i
stand
here
to
beg
of
hob
and
dick
that
do
appear
their
needless
vouches
custom
calls
me
what
custom
wills
in
all
things
should
we
the
dust
on
antique
time
would
lie
unswept
and
mountainous
error
be
too
highly
for
truth
to
rather
than
fool
it
so
let
the
high
office
and
the
honour
go
to
one
that
would
do
thus
i
am
half
through
the
one
part

i
would
be
consul
sixth
citizen
he
has
done
nobly
and
can
not

seventh

therefore
let

you
have

the
custom
of

are
to

anon
upon

there
coriolanus
coriolanus
may
i
change
these

sicinius
you
may
sir
coriolanus
that
i
straight
do
and
knowing
myself
again
repair
to
th
senate
house
menenius
i
keep
you
company
will
you
along
brutus
we
stay
here
for
the
people
sicinius
fare
you
well
exeunt
coriolanus
and
menenius
he
has
it
now
and
by
his
looks
methinks
is
warm
at
heart
brutus
with
a
proud
heart
he
wore
his
humble
weeds
will
you
dismiss
the
people
citizens
sicinius
how
now
my
masters
have
you
chose
this
man
first
citizen
he
has
our
voices
sir
brutus
we
pray
the
gods
he
may
deserve
your
loves
second
citizen
amen
sir
to
my
poor
unworthy
notice
he
mock
us
when
he
begg
our
voices
third
citizen
certainly
he
flouted
us
downright
first
citizen
no
is
his
kind
of
he
did
not
mock
us
second
citizen
not
one
amongst
us
save
yourself
but
says
he
us
us
scornfully
he
should
have
show
us
his
marks
of
merit
wounds
receiv
for
country
sicinius
why
so
he
did
i
am
sure
all
no
no
no
man
saw
third
citizen
he
said
he
had
wounds
which
he
could
show
in
private
and
with
his
hat
thus
waving
it
in
scorn
would
be
consul
says
he
custom
but
by
your
voices
will
not
so
permit
me
your
voices
therefore
when
we
granted
that
here
was
thank
you
for
your
voices
thank
you
your
most
sweet
voices
now
you
have
left
your
voices
i
have
no
further
with
you
was
not
this
mockery
sicinius
why
either
were
you
ignorant
to
or
seeing
it
of
such
childish
friendliness
to
yield
your
voices
brutus
could
you
not
have
told
as
you
were
when
he
had
no
power
but
was
a
petty
servant
to
the
state
he
was
your
enemy
ever
spake
against
your
liberties
and
the
charters
that
you
bear
i
th
body
of
the
weal
and
now
arriving
a
place
of
potency
and
sway
o
th
state
if
he
should
still
malignantly
remain
fast
foe
to
th
plebeii
your
voices
might
be
curses
to
yourselves
you
should
have
said
that
as
his
worthy
deeds
did
claim
no
less
than
what
he
stood
for
so
his
gracious
nature
would
think
upon
you
for
your
voices
and
translate
his
malice
towards
you
into
love
standing
your
friendly
lord
sicinius
thus
to
have
said
as
you
were
had
touch
his
spirit
and
tried
his
inclination
from
him
either
his
gracious
promise
which
you
might
as
cause
had
call
you
up
have
held
him
to
or
else
it
would
have
gall
his
surly
nature
which
easily
endures
not
article
tying
him
to
aught
so
putting
him
to
rage
you
should
have
th
advantage
of
his
choler
and
pass
him
unelected
brutus
did
you
perceive
he
did
solicit
you
in
free
contempt
when
he
did
need
your
loves
and
do
you
think
that
his
contempt
shall
not
be
bruising
to
you
when
he
hath
power
to
crush
why
had
your
bodies
no
heart
among
you
or
had
you
tongues
to
cry
against
the
rectorship
of
judgment
sicinius
have
you
ere
now
denied
the
asker
and
now
again
of
him
that
did
not
ask
but
mock
bestow
your
tongues
third
citizen
he
not
confirm
we
may
deny
him
yet
second
citizens
and
will
deny
him
i
have
five
hundred
voices
of
that
sound
first
citizen
i
twice
five
hundred
and
their
friends
to
piece
brutus
get
you
hence
instantly
and
tell
those
friends
they
have
chose
a
consul
that
will
from
them
take
their
liberties
make
them
of
no
more
voice
than
dogs
that
are
as
often
beat
for
barking
as
therefore
kept
to
do
so
sicinius
let
them
assemble
and
on
a
safer
judgment
all
revoke
your
ignorant
election
enforce
his
pride
and
his
old
hate
unto
you
besides
forget
not
with
what
contempt
he
wore
the
humble
weed
how
in
his
suit
he
scorn
you
but
your
loves
thinking
upon
his
services
took
from
you
th
apprehension
of
his
present
portance
which
most
gibingly
ungravely
he
did
fashion
after
the
inveterate
hate
he
bears
you
brutus
lay
a
fault
on
us
your
tribunes
that
we
labour
no
impediment
between
but
that
you
must
cast
your
election
on
him
sicinius
say
you
chose
him
more
after
our
commandment
than
as
guided
by
your
own
true
affections
and
that
your
minds
with
what
you
rather
must
do
than
what
you
should
made
you
against
the
grain
to
voice
him
consul
lay
the
fault
on
us
brutus
ay
spare
us
not
say
we
read
lectures
to
you
how
youngly
he
began
to
serve
his
country
how
long
continued
and
what
stock
he
springs
the
noble
house
o
th
marcians
from
whence
came
that
ancus
marcius
numa
daughter
son
who
after
great
hostilius
here
was
king
of
the
same
house
publius
and
quintus
were
that
our
best
water
brought
by
conduits
hither
and
censorinus
nobly
named
so
twice
being
by
the
people
chosen
censor
was
his
great
ancestor
sicinius
one
thus
descended
that
hath
beside
well
in
his
person
wrought
to
be
set
high
in
place
we
did
commend
to
your
remembrances
but
you
have
found
scaling
his
present
bearing
with
his
past
that
he
your
fixed
enemy
and
revoke
your
sudden
approbation
brutus
say
you
had
harp
on
that
but
by
our
putting
on
and
presently
when
you
have
drawn
your
number
repair
to
th
capitol
citizens
we
will
so
almost
all
repent
in
their
election
exeunt
plebeians
brutus
let
them
go
on
this
mutiny
were
better
put
in
hazard
than
stay
past
doubt
for
greater
if
as
his
nature
is
he
fall
in
rage
with
their
refusal
both
observe
and
answer
the
vantage
of
his
anger
sicinius
to
th
capitol
come
we
will
be
there
before
the
stream
o

this
shall
seem
as
partly

deserved
this
so
dishonour
rub
laid
falsely
i
th
plain
way
of
his
merit
coriolanus
tell
me
of
corn
this
was
my
speech
and
i
will
menenius
not
now
not
now
first
senator
not
in
this
heat
sir
now
coriolanus
now
as
i
live
i
will
my
nobler
friends
i
crave
their
pardons
for
the
mutable
many
let
them
regard
me
as
i
do
not
flatter
and
therein
behold
themselves
i
say
again
in
soothing
them
we
nourish
our
senate
the
cockle
of
rebellion
insolence
sedition
which
we
ourselves
have
plough
for
sow
and
scatter
by
mingling
them
with
us
the
honour
number
who
lack
not
virtue
no
nor
power
but
that
which
they
have
given
to
beggars
menenius
well
no
more
first
senator
no
more
words
we
beseech
you
coriolanus
how
no
more
as
for
my
country
i
have
shed
my
blood
not
fearing
outward
force
so
shall
my
lungs
coin
words
till
their
decay
against
those
measles
which
we
disdain
should
tetter
us
yet
sought
the
very
way
to
catch
them
brutus
you
speak
o
th
people
as
if
you
were
a
god
to
punish
not
a
man
of
their
infirmity
sicinius
well
we
let
the
people
menenius
what
what
his
choler
coriolanus
choler
were
i
as
patient
as
the
midnight
sleep
by
jove
be
my
mind
sicinius
it
is
a
mind
that
shall
remain
a
poison
where
it
is
not
poison
any
further
coriolanus
shall
remain
hear
you
this
triton
of
the
minnows
mark
you
his
absolute
cominius
was
from
the
canon
coriolanus
o
good
but
most
unwise
patricians
why
you
grave
but
reckless
senators
have
you
thus
given
hydra
leave
to
choose
an
officer
that
with
his
peremptory
being
but
the
horn
and
noise
o
th
monster
wants
not
spirit
to
say
he
turn
your
current
in
a
ditch
and
make
your
channel
his
if
he
have
power
then
vail
your
ignorance
if
none
awake
your
dangerous
lenity
if
you
are
learn
be
not
as
common
fools
if
you
are
not
let
them
have
cushions
by
you
you
are
plebeians
if
they
be
senators
and
they
are
no
less
when
both
your
voices
blended
the
taste
most
palates
theirs
they
choose
their
magistrate
and
such
a
one
as
he
who
puts
his
his
popular
against
a
graver
bench
than
ever
frown
in
greece
by
jove
himself
it
makes
the
consuls
base
and
my
soul
aches
to
know
when
two
authorities
are
up
neither
supreme
how
soon
confusion
may
enter
the
gap
of
both
and
take
the
one
by
th
other
cominius
well
on
to
th
coriolanus
whoever
gave
that
counsel
to
give
forth
the
corn
o
th
storehouse
gratis
as
was
sometime
in
menenius
well
well
no
more
of
that
coriolanus
though
there
the
people
had
more
absolute
i
say
they
nourish
disobedience
fed
the
ruin
of
the
state
brutus
why
shall
the
people
give
one
that
speaks
thus
their
voice
coriolanus
i
give
my
reasons
more
worthier
than
their
voices
they
know
the
corn
was
not
our
recompense
resting
well
they
did
service
being
press
to
th
war
even
when
the
navel
of
the
state
was
touch
they
would
not
thread
the
gates
this
kind
of
service
did
not
deserve
corn
gratis
being
i
th
war
their
mutinies
and
revolts
wherein
they
most
valour
spoke
not
for
them
th
accusation
which
they
have
often
made
against
the
senate
all
cause
unborn
could
never
be
the
motive
of
our
so
frank
donation
well
what
then
how
shall
this
bosom
multiplied
digest
the
senate
courtesy
let
deeds
express
what
like
to
be
their
words
did
request
it
we
are
the
greater
poll
and
in
true
fear
they
gave
us
our
demands
thus
we
debase
the
nature
of
our
seats
and
make
the
rabble
call
our
cares
fears
which
will
in
time
break
ope
the
locks
o
th
senate
and
bring
in
the
crows
to
peck
the
eagles
menenius
come
enough
brutus
enough
with
over
measure
coriolanus
no
take
more
what
may
be
sworn
by
both
divine
and
human
seal
what
i
end
withal
this
double
worship
where
one
part
does
disdain
with
cause
the
other
insult
without
all
reason
where
gentry
title
wisdom
can
not
conclude
but
by
the
yea
and
no
of
general
it
must
omit
real
necessities
and
give
way
the
while
to
unstable
slightness
purpose
so
barr
it
follows
nothing
is
done
to
purpose
therefore
beseech
you
that
will
be
less
fearful
than
discreet
that
love
the
fundamental
part
of
state
more
than
you
doubt
the
change
o
that
prefer
a
noble
life
before
a
long
and
wish
to
jump
a
body
with
a
dangerous
physic
that
sure
of
death
without
at
once
pluck
out
the
multitudinous
tongue
let
them
not
lick
the
sweet
which
is
their
poison
your
dishonour
mangles
true
judgment
and
bereaves
the
state
of
that
integrity
which
should
not
having
the
power
to
do
the
good
it
would
for
th
ill
which
doth
brutus
has
said
enough
sicinius
has
spoken
like
a
traitor
and
shall
answer
as
traitors
do
coriolanus
thou
wretch
despite
thee
what
should
the
people
do
with
these
bald
tribunes
on
whom
depending
their
obedience
fails
to
the
greater
bench
in
a
rebellion
when
what
not
meet
but
what
must
be
was
law
then
were
they
chosen
in
a
better

let
what
is

this
man
has
marr
his

menenius
his
nature
is
too
noble
for
the

he
would
not
flatter
neptune
for
his
trident
or
jove
for
power
to
thunder
his
heart
his
mouth
what
his
breast
forges
that
his

must
vent
and
being
angry
does
forget
that
ever
he
heard
the
name
of
death
a
noise

here
goodly
work
patricians
i
would
they

i
would
they
were

that

be
every

menenius
you
worthy
sicinius
he
shall
be
thrown
down
the
tarpeian
rock
with
rigorous
hands
he
hath
resisted
law
and
therefore
law
shall
scorn
him
further
trial
than
the
severity
of
the
public
power
which
he
so
sets
at
nought
first

he
shall
well
know
the
noble
tribunes

we
their

he
shall
sure
o
menenius
sir
sicinius
peace
menenius
do
not
cry
havoc
where
you
should

hunt
with
modest
warrant
sicinius

how
that
you
have
holp
to
make
this
rescue
menenius
hear
me
speak
as
i
do
know
the

i
may
be

i
would
crave
a
word
or
two
the
which
shall
turn
you
to
no
further
harm
than
so
much
loss
of

sicinius
speak
briefly
then
for
we
are
peremptory
to
dispatch
this
viperous
traitor
to
eject
him
hence
were
but
one
danger
and
to
keep
him
here
our
certain
death
therefore
it
is
decreed
he
dies
menenius
now
the
good
gods
forbid
that
our
renowned
rome
whose
gratitude
towards
her
deserved
children
is
in
jove
own

like
an
unnatural
dam
should
now
eat
up
her
own
sicinius
he
a
disease
that
must
be
cut
away
menenius
o
he
a
limb
that
has
but
a
mortal
to
cut
it
off
to
cure
it
easy
what
has
he
done
to
rome
that
worthy
death
killing
our
enemies
the
blood
he
hath
which
i
dare
vouch
is
more
than
that
he
hath
by
many
an
he
dropt
it
for
his
country
and
what
is
left
to
lose
it
by
his
country
were
to
us
all
that
and
suffer
it
a
brand
to
th
end
o
th
world
sicinius
this
is
clean
kam
brutus
merely
awry
when
he
did
love
his
country
it
honour
him
sicinius
the
service
of
the
foot
being
once
gangren
is
not
then
respected
for
what
before
it
was
brutus
we
hear
no
more
pursue
him
to
his
house
and
pluck
him
thence
lest
his
infection
being
of
catching
nature
spread
further
menenius
one
word
more
one
word
this
rage
when
it
shall
find
the
harm
of
unscann
swiftness

too
late

leaden

proceed
by

break
out

for
the
whole
state
i
would
put
mine
armour
on
which
i
can
scarcely
bear
coriolanus
what
must
i
do
menenius
return
to
th
tribunes
coriolanus
well
what
then
what
then
menenius
repent
what
you
have
spoke
coriolanus
for
them
i
can
not
do
it
to
the
gods
must
i
then
to
them
volumnia
you
are
too
absolute
though
therein
you
can
never
be
too
noble
but
when
extremities
speak
i
have
heard
you
say
honour
and
policy
like
unsever
friends
i
th
war
do
grow
together
grant
that
and
tell
me
in
peace
what
each
of
them
by
th
other
lose
that
they
combine
not
there
coriolanus
tush
tush
menenius
a
good
demand
volumnia
if
it
be
honour
in
your
wars
to
seem
the
same
you
are
not
which
for
your
best
ends
you
adopt
your
policy
how
is
it
less
or
worse
that
it
shall
hold
companionship
in
peace
with
honour
as
in
war
since
that
to
both
it
stands
in
like
request
coriolanus
why
force
you
this
volumnia
because
that
now
it
lies
you
on
to
speak
to
th
people
not
by
your
own
instruction
nor
by
th
matter
which
your
heart
prompts
you
but
with
such
words
that
are
but
roted
in
your
tongue
though
but
bastards
and
syllables
of
no
allowance
to
your
bosom
truth
now
this
no
more
dishonours
you
at
all
than
to
take
in
a
town
with
gentle
words
which
else
would
put
you
to
your
fortune
and
the
hazard
of
much
blood
i
would
dissemble
with
my
nature
where
my
fortunes
and
my
friends
at
stake
i
should
do
so
in
honour
i
am
in
this
your
wife
your
son
these
senators
the
nobles
and
you
will
rather
show
our
general
louts
how
you
can
frown
than
spend
a
fawn
upon
for
the
inheritance
of
their
loves
and
safeguard
of
what
that
want
might
ruin
menenius
noble
lady
come

soft
way
which
thou
dost
confess

thee
to

as
thou

coriolanus
i
am
content
menenius
lo
citizens
he
says
he
is
content
the
warlike

has
done
consider
think
upon
the
wounds
his

bears
which
show
like
graves
i
th
holy
churchyard
coriolanus
scratches
with
briers
scars
to
move
laughter
only
menenius
consider
further
that
when
he
speaks
not
like
a
citizen
you
find
him
like
a
soldier
do
not
take
his
rougher
accents
for
malicious
sounds
but
as
i
say
such
as
become
a
soldier
rather
than
envy
you
cominius
well
well
no
more
coriolanus
what
is
the
matter
that
being
pass
for
consul
with
full
voice
i
am
so
dishonour
that
the
very
hour
you
take
it
off
again
sicinius
answer
to
us
coriolanus
say
then
is
true
i
ought
so
sicinius
we
charge
you
that
you
have
contriv
to
take
from

all
season
office
and
to
wind
yourself
into
a
power
tyrannical
for
which
you
are
a
traitor
to
the

coriolanus
traitor
menenius
nay
temperately
your
promise
coriolanus

fires
i
th
lowest
hell
fold
in

call
me
their
traitor
thou
injurious
tribune
within
thine
eyes
sat
twenty
thousand
deaths
in
thy
hands
clutch
as
many
millions
in
thy
lying
tongue
both
numbers
i
would
say
liest
unto
thee
with
a
voice
as
free
as
i
do
pray
the
gods
sicinius
mark
you
this
people
plebeians
to
th
rock
to
th
rock
with
him
sicinius
peace
we
need
not
put
new
matter
to
his
charge
what
you
have
seen
him
do
and
heard
him
speak
beating
your
officers
cursing
yourselves
opposing
laws
with
strokes
and
here
defying
those
whose
great
power
must
try
even
this
so
criminal
and
in
such
capital
kind
deserves
th
extremest
death
brutus
but
since
he
hath
serv
well
for
coriolanus
what
do
you
prate
of
service
brutus
i
talk
of
that
that
know
it
coriolanus
you
menenius
is
this
the
promise
that
you
made
your
mother
cominius
know
i
pray
coriolanus
i
know
no
further
let
them
pronounce
the
steep
tarpeian
death
vagabond
exile
flaying
pent
to
linger
but
with
a
grain
a
day
i
would
not
buy
their
mercy
at
the
price
of
one
fair
word
nor
check
my
courage
for
what
they
can
give
to
with
saying
morrow
sicinius
for
that
he
as
much
as
in
him
from
time
to
time
envied
against
the
people
seeking
means
to
pluck
away
their
power
as
now
at
last
given
hostile
strokes
and
that
not
in
the
presence
of
dreaded
justice
but
on
the
ministers
that
do
distribute
in
the
name
o
th
people
and
in
the
power
of
us
the
tribunes
we
from
this

banish

of

would
have
thee
but
in

spite
to
be
full
quit
of

i
before
thee
here
then
if
thou
hast
a
heart
of
wreak
in
thee
that
wilt
revenge
thine
own
particular
wrongs
and
stop
those
maims
of
shame
seen
through
thy
country
speed
thee
straight
and
make
my
misery
serve
thy
turn
so
use
it
that
my
revengeful
services
may
prove
as
benefits
to
thee
for
i
will
fight
against
my

the
spleen
of
all
the
under
fiends

if
so

thou
not
this

then
in

i
also
am
longer
to
live
most
weary
and
present
my
throat
to
thee
and
to
thy
ancient
malice
which
not
to
cut
would
show
thee
but
a
fool
since
i
have
ever
followed
thee
with
hate
drawn
tuns
of
blood
out
of
thy
country
breast
and
can
not
live
but
to
thy
shame
unless
it
be
to
do
thee
service
aufidius
o
marcius
marcius
each
word
thou
hast
spoke
hath
weeded
from
my
heart
a
root
of
ancient
envy
if
jupiter
should
from
yond
cloud
speak
divine
things
and
say
true
i
not
believe
them
more
than
thee
all
noble
marcius
let
me
twine
mine
arms
about
that
body
where
against
my
grained
ash
an
hundred
times
hath
broke
and
scarr
the
moon
with
splinters
here
i
clip
the
anvil
of
my
sword
and
do
contest
as
hotly
and
as
nobly
with
thy
love
as
ever
in
ambitious
strength
i
did
contend
against
thy
valour
know
thou
first
i
lov
the
maid
i
married
never

sigh
truer
breath
but
that
i
see
thee
here
thou
noble
thing
more
dances
my
rapt
heart
than
when
i
first
my
wedded
mistress
saw
bestride
my
threshold
why
thou
mars
i
tell
thee
we
have
a
power
on
foot
and
i
had
purpose
once
more
to
hew
thy
target
from
thy
brawn
or
lose
mine
arm
thou
hast
beat
me
out
twelve
several
times
and
i
have
nightly
since
dreamt
of
encounters
thyself
and
we
have
been
down
together
in
my
sleep
unbuckling
helms
fisting
each
other
and
wak
half
dead
with
nothing
worthy
marcius
had
we
no
other
quarrel
else
to
rome
but
that
thou
art
thence
banish
we
would
muster
all
from
twelve
to
seventy
and
pouring
war
into
the
bowels
of
ungrateful
rome
like
a
bold
flood
o
come

friendly
senators

one
half
of
my
commission
and
set
as
best
thou
art
experienc
since
thou
thy
country
strength
and
thine
own
ways
whether
to
knock
against
the
gates
of
rome
or
rudely
visit
them
in
parts
remote
to
fright
them
ere
destroy
but
come
in
let
me
commend
thee
first
to
those
that

false
report
of
him

i
i
be
sworn

to
be
the
greater
soldier

not
tell
how
to

would
not
be
a
roman
of
all
nations
i
had
as
lief
be
a
condemn
man
both
wherefore
wherefore
third
servant
why
here
he
that
was
wont
to
thwack
our
caius
marcius
first
servant
why
do
you
say
our
general
third
servant
i
do
not
say
our
general
but
he
was
always
good
enough
for
him
second
servant
come
we
are
fellows
and
friends
he
was
ever
too
hard
for
him
i
have
heard
him
say
so
himself
first
servant
he
was
too
hard
for
him
directly
to
say
the
troth
o
before
corioli
he
scotch
him
and
notch
him
like
a
carbonado
second
servant
an
he
had
been
cannibally
given
he
might
have
broil
and
eaten
him
too
first
servant
but
more
of
thy
news
third
servant
why
he
is
so
made
on
here
within
as
if
he
were
son
and
heir
to
mars
set
at
upper
end
o
th
table
no
question
asked
him
by
any
of
the
senators
but
they
stand
bald
before
him
our
general
himself
makes
a
mistress
of
him
sanctifies
himself
with
hand
and
turns
up
the
white
o
th
eye
to
his
discourse
but
the
bottom
of
the
news
is
our
general
is
cut
i
middle
and
but
one
half
of
what
he
was
yesterday
for
the
other
has
half
by
the
entreaty
and
grant
of
the
whole
table
he
go
he
says
and
sowl
the
porter
of
rome
gates
by
th
ears
he
will
mow
all
down
before
him
and
leave
his
passage
poll
second
servant
and
he
as
like
to
as
any
man
i
can
imagine
third
servant
he
will
for
look
you
sir
he
has
as
many
friends
as
enemies
which
friends
sir
as
it
were
durst
look
you
show
themselves
as
we
term
it
his
friends
whilst
he
in
directitude
first
servant
directitude
what
that
third
servant
but
when
they
shall
see
sir
his
crest
up
again
and
the
man
in
blood
they
will
out
of
their
burrows
like
conies
after
rain
and
revel
all
with
him
first
servant
but
when
goes
this
forward
third
servant
presently
you
shall
have
the
drum
struck
up
this
afternoon
is
as
it
were
parcel
of
their
feast
and
to
be
executed
ere
they
wipe
their
lips
second
servant
why
then
we
shall
have
a
stirring
world
again
this
peace
is
nothing
but
to
rust
iron
increase
tailors
and
breed
first
servant
let
me
have
war
say
i
it
exceeds
peace
as
far
as
day
does
night
it
spritely
waking
audible
and
full
of
vent
peace
is
a
very
apoplexy
lethargy
mull
deaf
sleepy
insensible
a
getter
of
more
bastard
children
than
war
a
destroyer
of
men
second
servant
is
so
and
as
war
in
some
sort
may
be
said
to
be
a
ravisher
so
it
can
not
be
denied
but
peace
is
a
great
maker
of
cuckolds
first
servant
ay
and
it
makes
men
hate
one
another
third
servant
reason
because
they
then
less
need
one
another
the
wars
for
my
money
i
hope
to
see
romans
as
cheap
as
volscians

before
were

rather

i
think
not
so

we
should
by
this
to
all
our
lamentation
if
he
had
gone
forth
consul
found

the

have

prevented

reports
the

powers
are
in
the
roman

and
with
the
deepest
malice
of
the

destroy
what
lies
before
menenius
is
aufidius
who
hearing
of
our
marcius
banishment
thrusts
forth
his
horns
again
into
the
world
which
were
inshell
when
marcius
stood
for
rome
and
durst
not
once
peep

have
record
that
very
well
it
can
and
three
examples
of
the
like
hath
been
within
my
age
but
reason
with
the
fellow
before
you
punish
him
where
he
heard
this
lest
you
shall
chance
to
whip
your
information
and

fearful
is

sicinius
what
more
fearful
messenger
it
is
spoke
freely
out

how
probable
i
do
not
that
marcius
join

aufidius
leads
a
power
rome
and
vows
revenge
as
spacious
as
between
the

this
is
most
likely

only
that
the
weaker

may
wish
good

the

cominius
ay
and
you
look
pale

all
the

do
smilingly
revolt

undone
unless

have
mercy
cominius
who
shall
ask
it
the
tribunes
can
not
for
shame
the

deserve
such
pity
of
him
as
the
wolf
does
of
the
shepherds
for
his
best
friends
if
they
should
say
good
to

charg
him
even
as
those
should
do
that
had
deserv
his

therein
show
like

menenius
is
true
if
he
were
putting
to
my
house
the

that
should
consume
it
i
have
not
the

to
say
you
cease
you
have
made
fair

you
and
your

you
have
crafted

cominius
you
have
brought
a
trembling
upon

such
as
was
never
so
incapable
of
help
both
tribunes
say
not
we
brought
it
menenius
how
we
we
lov
him
but
like
beasts
and
cowardly
nobles
gave
way
unto
your
clusters
who
did
hoot
him
out
o
th
city

but
i
fear
they
roar
him
in
again
tullus
aufidius
the
second
name
of
men
obeys
his
points
as
if
he
were
his

desperation
is
all
the

strength
and
defence
that
rome
can
make
against
them
enter
a

of
citizens
menenius
here
comes
the

and
is
aufidius
with

stinking
greasy
caps

coming
and
not
a
hair
upon

soldier
head
which
will
not
prove
a
whip

many
coxcombs
as

up
will
he
tumble
down

pay
you
for

i
said

pity
second
citizen
and
so
did
i
third
citizen
and
so
did
i
and
to
say
the
truth
so
did
very
many
of
us
that
we
did
we
did
for
the
best
and
though
we
willingly
consented
to
his
banishment
yet
it
was
against
our
will
cominius
goodly
things

side
that
would
be
glad
to
have

and
show
no
sign
of
fear
first
citizen
the
gods
be
good
to
us
come
masters

ever
said

were
i
th
wrong
when
we
banish

but
come
let
home
exeunt
citizens
brutus
i
do
not
like
this
news
sicinius
nor
brutus
let
to
the
capitol
would
half
my
wealth
would
buy
this
for
a
lie
sicinius
pray
let
go
exeunt
scene
vii
a
camp
at
a
short
distance
from
rome
enter
aufidius
with
his
lieutenant
aufidius
do
they
still
fly
to
th
roman
lieutenant
i
do
not
know
what
witchcraft
in
him
but
your
soldiers
use
him
as
the
grace
fore
meat
their
talk
at
table
and
their
thanks
at
end
and
you
are
in
this
action
sir
even
by
your
own
aufidius
i
can
not
help
it
now
unless
by
using
means
i
lame
the
foot
of
our
design
he
bears
himself
more
proudlier
even
to
my
person
than
i
thought
he
would
when
first
i
did
embrace
him
yet
his
nature
in
that
no
changeling
and
i
must
excuse
what
can
not
be
amended
lieutenant
yet
i
wish
i
mean
for
your
you
had
not
join
in
commission
with
him
but
either
had
borne
the
action
of
yourself
or
else
to
him
had
left
it
solely
aufidius
i
understand
thee
well
and
be
thou
sure
when
he
shall
come
to
his
account
he
knows
not
what
i
can
urge
against
him
although
it
seems
and
so
he
thinks
and
is
no
less
apparent
to
th
vulgar
eye
that
he
bears
all
things
fairly
and
shows
good
husbandry
for
the
volscian
state
fights
and
does
achieve
as
soon
as
draw
his
sword
yet
he
hath
left
undone
that
which
shall
break
his
neck
or
hazard
mine
we
come
to
our
account
lieutenant
sir
i
beseech
you
think
you
he
carry
rome
aufidius
all
places
yield
to
him
ere
he
sits
down
and
the
nobility
of
rome
are
his
the
senators
and
patricians
love
him
too
the
tribunes
are
no
soldiers
and
their
people
will
be
as
rash
in
the
repeal
as
hasty
to
expel
him
thence
i
think
he
be
to
rome
as
is
the
osprey
to
the
fish
who
takes
it
by
sovereignty
of
nature
first
he
was
a
noble
servant
to
them
but
he
could
not
carry
his
honours
even
whether
was
pride
which
out
of
daily
fortune
ever
taints
the
happy
man
whether
defect
of
judgment
to
fail
in
the
disposing
of
those
chances
which
he
was
lord
of
or
whether
nature
not
to
be
other
than
one
thing
not
moving
from
th
casque
to
th
cushion
but
commanding
peace
even
with
the
same
austerity
and
garb
as
he
controll
the
war
but
one
of
as
he
hath
spices
of
them
not
all
for
i
dare
so
far
free
made
him
fear
so
hated
and
so
banish
but
he
has
a
merit
to
choke
it
in
the
so
our
virtues
lie
in
th
interpretation
of
the
time
and
power
unto
itself
most
commendable
hath
not
a
tomb
so
evident
as
a
cheer
t
extol
what
it
hath
done
one
fire
drives

enter
menenius
cominius
sicinius
and
brutus
the
two
tribunes
with
others
menenius
no
i
not
go
you
hear
what
he
hath
said
which
was
sometime
his
general
who
lov
him
in
a
most
dear
particular
he
call
me
father
but
what
o
that
go
you
that
banish
him
a
mile
before
his
tent
fall
down
and
knee
the
way
into
his
mercy
nay
if
he
to
hear
cominius
speak
i
keep
at
home
cominius
he
would
not
seem
to
know
me
menenius
do
you
hear
cominius
yet
one
time
he
did
call
me
by
my
name
i
urg
our
old
acquaintance
and
the
drops
that
we
have
bled
together
he
would
not
answer
to
forbid
all
names
he
was
a
kind
of
nothing
titleless
till
he
had
forg
himself
a
name
i
th
fire
of
burning
rome
menenius
why
so
you
have
made
good
work
a
pair
of
tribunes
that
have
wrack
for
rome
to
make
coals
a
noble
memory
cominius
i
minded
him
how
royal
was
to
pardon
when
it
was
less
expected
he
replied
it
was
a
bare
petition
of
a
state
to
one
whom
they
had
punish
menenius
very
well
could
he
say
less
cominius
i
offer
to
awaken
his
regard
for
private
friends
his
answer
to
me
was
he
could
not
stay
to
pick
them
in
a
pile
of
noisome
musty
chaff
he
said
was
folly
for
one
poor
grain
or
two
to
leave
unburnt
and
still
to
nose
th
offence
menenius
for
one
poor
grain
or
two
i
am
one
of
those
his
mother
wife
his
child
and
this
brave
fellow
we
are
the
grains
you
are
the
musty
chaff
and
you
are
smelt
above
the
moon
we
must
be
burnt
for
you
sicinius
nay
pray
be
patient
if
you
refuse
your
aid
in
this
so
help
yet
do
not
upbraid
with
our
distress
but
sure
if
you
would
be
your
country
pleader
your
good
tongue
more
than
the
instant
army
we
can
make
might
stop
our
countryman
menenius
no
i
not
meddle
sicinius
pray
you
go
to
him
menenius
what
should
i
do
brutus
only
make
trial
what
your
love
can
do
for
rome
towards
marcius
menenius
well
and
say
that
marcius
return
me
as
cominius
is
return
what
then
but
as
a
discontented
friend
with
his
unkindness
be
so
sicinius
yet
your
good
will
must
have
that
thanks
from
rome
after
the
measure
as
you
intended
well
menenius
i
i
think
he
hear
me
yet
to
bite
his
lip
and
hum
at
good
cominius
much
unhearts
me
he
was
not
taken
well
he
had
not
din
the
veins
unfill
our
blood
is
cold
and
then
we
pout
upon
the
morning
are
unapt
to
give
or
to
forgive
but
when
we
have
these
pipes
and
these
conveyances
of
our
blood
with
wine
and
feeding
we
have
suppler
souls
than
in
our
fasts
therefore
i
watch
him
till
he
be
dieted
to
my
request
and
then
i
set
upon
him
brutus
you
know
the
very
road
into
his
kindness
and
can
not
lose
your
way
menenius
good
faith
i
prove
him
speed
how
it
will
i
shall
ere
long
have
knowledge
of
my
success
exit
cominius
he
never
hear
him
sicinius
not
cominius
i
tell
you
he
does
sit
in
gold
his
eye
red
as
burn
rome
and
his
injury
the
gaoler
to
his
pity
i
kneel
before
him
was
very
faintly
he
said
dismiss
me
thus
with
his
speechless
hand
what
he
would
do
he
sent
in
writing
after
me
what
he
would
not
bound
with
an
oath
to
yield
to
his
conditions
so
that
all
hope
is
vain
unless
his
noble
mother
and
his
wife
who
as
i
hear
mean
to
solicit
him
for
mercy
to
his
country
therefore
let
hence
and
with
our
fair
entreaties
haste
them
on
exeunt
scene
ii
the
volscian
camp
before
rome
enter
menenius
to
the

on
guard
first
watch
stay
whence
are
you
second

stand
and
go
back
menenius
you
guard
like
men
is
well
but
by
your
leave
i
am
an
officer
of
state
and
come
to
speak
with
coriolanus
first
watch
from
whence
menenius
from
rome
first
watch
you
may
not
pass
you
must
return
our
general
will
no
more
hear
from
thence
second
watch
you
see
your
rome
embrac
with
fire
before
you
speak
with
coriolanus
menenius
good
my
friends
if
you
have
heard
your
general
talk
of
rome
and
of
his
friends
there
it
is
lots
to
blanks
my
name
hath
touch
your
ears
it
is
menenius
first
watch
be
it
so
go
back
the
virtue
of
your
name
is
not
here
passable
menenius
i
tell
thee
fellow
thy
general
is
my
lover
i
have
been
the
book
of
his
good
acts
whence
men
have
read
his
fame
unparallel
haply
amplified
for
i
have
ever
verified
my
of
whom
he
with
all
the
size
that
verity
would
without
lapsing
suffer
nay
sometimes
like
to
a
bowl
upon
a
subtle
ground
i
have
tumbled
past
the
throw
and
in
his
praise
have
almost
stamp
the
leasing
therefore
fellow
i
must
have
leave
to
pass
first
watch
faith
sir
if
you
had
told
as
many
lies
in
his
behalf
as
you
have
uttered
words
in
your
own
you
should
not
pass
here
no
though
it
were
as
virtuous
to
lie
as
to
live
chastely
therefore
go
back
menenius
prithee
fellow
remember
my
name
is
menenius
always
factionary
on
the
party
of
your
general
second
watch

have
been
his
liar
as
you
say
you
have
i
am
one
that
telling
true

must
say
you
can
not
pass
therefore

does
can
you
when

have
push
out
your
gates
the
very
defender
of
them
and
in
a
violent
popular
ignorance
given
your
enemy
your
shield
think
to
front
his
revenges
with
the
easy
groans
of
old
women
the
virginal
palms
of
your
daughters
or
with
the
palsied
intercession
of
such
a
decay
dotant
as
you
seem
to
be
can
you
think
to
blow
out
the
intended
fire
your
city
is
ready
to
flame
in
with
such
weak
breath
as
this
no
you

how
plainly
i
have
borne
this

aufidius
only
their

you
have
respected
stopp

never
admitted

with

i
have
sent

lov
me
above
the

nay
godded
me
indeed
their
latest
refuge
was

i
show
sourly
to
once
more
the
first
conditions
which
they
did
refuse

can
not

accept
to

him
only
that
thought
he
could
do
more
a
very
little
i
have
yielded
to
fresh
embassies
and
suits
nor
from
the

hereafter
will
i
lend

do
you
know
this

coriolanus
the

of

volumnia
this
is
a
poor
epitome
of
yours
which
by
th
interpretation
of
full
time
may
show
like
all
yourself
coriolanus
the
god
of
soldiers
with
the
consent
of
supreme
jove
inform
thy

with
nobleness
that
thou
mayst
prove
to

unvulnerable
and
stick
i
th

like
a
great
standing
every

and
saving
those

volumnia
your

sirrah
coriolanus
that
my
brave
boy
volumnia
even
he
your

this
lady
and
myself
are
suitors
to
you
coriolanus
i
beseech
you
peace
or
if
you
ask
remember
this
before
the
thing
i
have
forsworn
to
grant
may
never
be
held
by
you
denials
do
not
bid
me
dismiss
my
soldiers
or
capitulate
again
with
rome
mechanics
tell
me
not
wherein
i
seem
unnatural
desire
not
my
rages
and
revenges
with
your
colder
reasons
volumnia
o
no
more
no
more
you
have
said
you
will
not
grant
us
any
for
we
have
nothing
else
to
ask
but
that
which
you
deny
already
yet
we
will
ask
that
if
you
fail
in
our
request
the
blame
may
hang
upon
your
hardness
therefore
hear
us
coriolanus
aufidius
and
you
volsces
mark
for
hear
nought
from
rome
in
private
your
request
volumnia
should
we
be
silent
and
not
speak
our
raiment
and
state
of
bodies
would
bewray
what
life
we
have
led
since
thy
exile
think
with
thyself
how
more
unfortunate
than
all
living
women
are
we
come
hither
since
that
thy
sight
which
should
make
our
eyes
flow
with
joy
hearts
dance
with
comforts
constrains
them
weep
and
shake
with
fear
and
sorrow
making
the
mother
wife
and
child
to
see
the
son
the
husband
and
the
father
tearing
his
country
bowels
out
and
to
poor
we
thine
enmity
most
capital
thou
us
our
prayers
to
the
gods
which
is
a
comfort
that
all
but
we
enjoy
for
how
can
we
alas
how
can
we
for
our
country
pray
whereto
we
are
bound
together
with
thy
victory
whereto
we
are
bound
alack
or
we
must
lose
the
country
our
dear
nurse
or
else
thy
person
our
comfort
in
the
country
we
must
find
an
evident
calamity
though
we
had
our
wish
which
side
should
win
for
either
thou
must
as
a
foreign
recreant
be
led
with
manacles
through
our
streets
or
else
triumphantly
tread
on
thy
country
ruin
and
bear
the
palm
for
having
bravely
shed
thy
wife
and
children
blood
for
myself
son
i
purpose
not
to
wait
on
fortune
till
these
wars
determine
if
i
can
not
persuade
thee
rather
to
show
a
noble
grace
to
both
parts
than
seek
the
end
of
one
thou
shalt
no
sooner
march
to
assault
thy
country
than
to
trust
thou
shalt
on
thy
mother
womb
that
brought
thee
to
this
world
virgilia
ay
and
mine
that
brought
you
forth
this
boy
to
keep
your
name
living
to
time
boy
shall
not
tread
on
me
i
run
away
till
i
am
bigger
but
then
i
fight
coriolanus
not
of
a
woman
tenderness
to
be
requires
nor
child
nor
woman
face
to
see
i
have
sat
too
long
rising
volumnia
nay
go
not
from
us
thus
if
it
were
so
that
our
request
did
tend
to
save
the
romans
thereby
to
destroy
the
volsces
whom
you
serve
you
might
condemn
us
as
poisonous
of
your
honour
no
our
suit
is
that
you
reconcile
them
while
the
volsces
may
say
mercy
we
have
show
the
romans
we
receiv
and
each
in
either
side
give
the
to
thee
and
cry
blest
for
making
up
this
peace
thou
great
son
the
end
of
war
uncertain
but
this
certain
that
if
thou
conquer
rome
the
benefit
which
thou
shalt
thereby
reap
is
such
a
name
whose
repetition
will
be
dogg
with
curses
whose
chronicle
thus
writ
man
was
noble
but
with
his
last
attempt
he
wip
it
out
destroy
his
country
and
his
name
remains
to
th
ensuing
age
abhorr
speak
to
me
son
thou
hast
affected
the
fine
strains
of
honour
to
imitate
the
graces
of
the
gods
to
tear
with
thunder
the
wide
cheeks
o
th
air
and
yet
to
charge
thy
sulphur
with
a
bolt
that
should
but
rive
an
oak
why
dost
not
speak
thou
it
honourable
for
a
noble
man
still
to
remember
wrongs
daughter
speak
you
he
cares
not
for
your
weeping
speak
thou
boy
perhaps
thy
childishness
will
move
him
more
than
can
our
reasons
there
no
man
in
the
world
more
bound
to
mother
yet
here
he
lets
me
prate
like
one
i
th
stocks
thou
hast
never
in
thy
life
show
thy
dear
mother
any
courtesy
when
she
poor
hen
fond
of
no
second
brood
has
cluck
thee
to
the
wars
and
safely
home

aufidius

coriolanus
i
dare
be
sworn
you
were

sir
it
is
no

we

you
shall
bear
a
better
witness
back
than
words
which
we
on
like
conditions
will
have
come
enter
with
us
ladies
you
deserve
to
have
a
temple
built
you
all
the

could
not

why
what
of
that

if
it
be

for
you
to
displace
it
with
your
little
finger
there
is
some
hope
the
ladies
of
rome
especially
his
mother
may
prevail
with
him
but
i
say
there
is
no
hope
i
our
throats
are

stay
upon

sicinius
possible
that
so
short
a
time
can
alter
the
condition
of

there

he
lov
his

dearly
menenius
so
did
he
me

he
no
more
remembers
his

of
his
face
sours
ripe
grapes
when
he
walks
he
moves
like
an

and
the

shrinks
before
his

he
is
able
to
pierce
a
corslet
with
his
eye
talks
like
a
knell
and
his
hum
is
a
battery
he
sits
in
his
state
as
a
thing
made
for
alexander
what
he
bids
be
done
is
finish
with
his

he
wants
nothing

eternity
