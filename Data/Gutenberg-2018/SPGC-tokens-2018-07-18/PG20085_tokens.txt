tragic
muse
by

martin
street

preface
i
profess
a
certain
vagueness
of
remembrance
in
respect
to
the
origin
and
growth
of
tragic
which
appeared
in
the
again
beginning
january
and
running
on
inordinately
several
months
beyond
its
proper
twelve
if
it
be
ever
of
interest
and
profit
to
put
one
finger
on
the
productive
germ
of
a
work
of
art
and
if
in
fact
a
lucid
account
of
any
such
work
involves
that
prime
identification
i
can
but
look
on
the
present
fiction
as
a
poor
fatherless
and
motherless
a
sort
of
unregistered
and
unacknowledged
birth
i
fail
to
recover
my
precious
first
moment
of
consciousness
of
the
idea
to
which
it
was
to
give
form
to
recognise
in
it
as
i
like
to
do
in
general
the
effect
of
some
particular
sharp
impression
or
concussion
i
call
such
remembered
glimmers
always
precious
because
without
them
comes
no
clear
vision
of
what
one
may
have
intended
and
without
that
vision
no
straight
measure
of
what
one
may
have
succeeded
in
doing
what
i
make
out
from
furthest
back
is
that
i
must
have
had
from
still
further
back
must
in
fact
practically
have
always
had
the
happy
thought
of
some
dramatic
picture
of
the
and
of
the
difficult
terms
on
which
it
is
at
the
best
secured
and
enjoyed
the
general
question
of
its
having
to
be
not
altogether
easily
paid
for
to
do
something
about
art
art
that
is
as
a
human
complication
and
a
social
must
have
been
for
me
early
a
good
deal
of
a
nursed
intention
the
conflict
between
art
and
the
world
striking
me
thus
betimes
as
one
of
the
great
primary
motives
i
remember
even
having
taken
for
granted
with
this
fond
inveteracy
that
no
one
of
these
pregnant
themes
was
likely
to
prove
under
the
test
more
full
of
matter
this
being
the
case
meanwhile
what
would
all
experience
have
done
but
enrich
one
conviction
since
if
on
the
one
hand
i
had
gained
a
more
and
more
intimate
view
of
the
nature
of
art
and
the
conditions
therewith
imposed
so
the
world
was
a
conception
that
clearly
required
and
that
would
for
ever
continue
to
take
any
amount
of
the
happy
and
fruitful
truth
at
all
events
was
that
there
was
opposition
why
there
be
was
another
matter
and
that
the
opposition
would
beget
an
infinity
of
situations
what
had
doubtless
occurred
in
fact
moreover
was
that
just
this
question
of
the
essence
and
the
reasons
of
the
opposition
had
shown
itself
to
demand
the
light
of
experience
so
that
to
the
growth
of
experience
truly
the
treatment
of
the
subject
had
yielded
it
had
waited
for
that
advantage
yet
i
continue
to
see
experience
giving
me
its
jog
mainly
in
the
form
of
an
invitation
from
the
gentle
editor
of
the
the
late
thomas
bailey
aldrich
to
contribute
to
his
pages
a
serial
that
should
run
through
the
year
that
friendly
appeal
becomes
thus
the
most
definite
statement
i
can
make
of
the
genesis
of
the
book
though
from
the
moment
of
its
reaching
me
everything
else
in
the
matter
seems
to
live
again
what
lives
not
least
to
be
quite
candid
is
the
fact
that
i
was
to
see
this
production
make
a
virtual
end
for
the
time
as
by
its
sinister
effect
though
for
reasons
still
obscure
to
me
of
the
pleasant
old
custom
of
the
running
of
the
novel
not
for
many
years
was
i
to
feel
the
practice
for
my
benefit
confidingly
revive
the
influence
of
tragic
was
thus
exactly
other
than
what
i
had
all
earnestly
if
of
course
privately
enough
invoked
for
it
and
i
remember
well
the
particular
chill
at
last
of
the
sense
of
my
having
launched
it
in
a
great
grey
void
from
which
no
echo
or
message
whatever
would
come
back
none
in
the
event
ever
came
and
as
i
now
read
the
book
over
i
find
the
circumstance
make
in
its
name
for
a
special
tenderness
of
charity
even
for
that
finer
consideration
hanging
in
the
parental
breast
about
the
maimed
or
slighted
the
disfigured
or
defeated
the
unlucky
or
unlikely
child
with
this
hapless
small
mortal
thought
of
further
as
somehow
compromising
i
am
thus
able
to
take
the
thing
as
having
quite
wittingly
and
undisturbedly
existed
for
itself
alone
and
to
liken
it
to
some
aromatic
bag
of
gathered
herbs
of
which
the
string
has
never
been
loosed
or
better
still
to
some
jar
of
potpourri
shaped
and
overfigured
and
polished
but
of
which
the
lid
never
lifted
has
provided
for
the
intense
accumulation
of
the
fragrance
within
the
consistent
the
sustained
preserved
of
tragic
its
constant
and
doubtless
rather
truth
to
its
particular
sought
pitch
and
accent
are
critically
speaking
its
principal
merit
the
inner
harmony
that
i
perhaps
presumptuously
permit
myself
to
compare
to
an
unevaporated
scent
after
which
indeed
i
may
well
be
summoned
to
say
what
i
mean
in
such
a
business
by
an
appreciable
tone
and
how
i
can
justify
my
claim
to
it
a
demonstration
that
will
await
us
later
suffice
it
just
here
that
i
find
the
latent
historic
clue
in
my
hand
again
with
the
easy
recall
of
my
prompt
grasp
of
such
a
chance
to
make
a
story
about
art
was
my
subject
this
time
all
mature
with
having
long
waited
and
with
the
blest
dignity
that
my
original
perception
of
its
value
was
quite
lost
in
the
mists
of
youth
i
must
long
have
carried
in
my
head
the
notion
of
a
young
man
who
should
amid
difficulty
the
difficulties
being
the
story
have
abandoned
public
life
for
the
zealous
pursuit
of
some
supposedly
minor
craft
just
as
evidently
there
had
hovered
before
me
some
possible
picture
but
all
comic
and
ironic
of
one
of
the
most
salient
london
social
passions
the
unappeasable
curiosity
for
the
things
of
the
theatre
for
every
one
of
them
that
is
except
the
drama
itself
and
for
the
personality
of
the
performer
almost
any
performer
quite
sufficiently
serving
in
particular
this
latter
verily
had
struck
me
as
an
aspect
appealing
mainly
to
satiric
treatment
the
only
adequate
or
effective
treatment
i
had
again
and
again
felt
for
most
of
the
distinctively
social
aspects
of
london
the
general
artlessly
histrionised
air
of
things
caused
so
many
examples
to
spring
from
behind
any
hedge
what
came
up
however
at
once
for
my
own
stretched
canvas
was
that
it
would
have
to
be
ample
give
me
really
space
to
turn
round
and
that
a
single
illustrative
case
might
easily
be
meagre
fare
the
young
man
who
should
chuck
admired
politics
and
of
course
some
other
admired
object
with
them
would
be
all
very
well
but
he
would
be
enough
therefore
what
should
one
say
to
some
other
young
man
who
would
chuck
something
and
somebody
else
admired
in
their
way
too
there
need
never
at
the
worst
be
any
difficulty
about
the
things
advantageously
chuckable
for
art
the
question
is
all
but
of
choosing
them
in
the
heap
yet
were
i
to
represent
a
struggle
an
interesting
one
indispensably
with
the
passions
of
the
theatre
as
a
profession
or
at
least
as
an
absorption
i
should
have
to
place
the
theatre
in
another
light
than
the
satiric
this
however
would
by
good
luck
be
perfectly
possible
too
without
a
sacrifice
of
truth
and
i
should
doubtless
even
be
able
to
make
my
theatric
case
as
important
as
i
might
desire
it
it
seemed
clear
that
i
needed
big
cases
small
ones
would
practically
give
my
central
idea
away
and
i
make
out
now
my
still
labouring
under
the
illusion
that
the
case
of
the
sacrifice
for
art
ever
be
with
truth
with
taste
with
discretion
involved
apparently
and
showily
big
i
daresay
it
glimmered
upon
me
even
then
that
the
very
sharpest
difficulty
of
the
victim
of
the
conflict
i
should
seek
to
represent
and
the
very
highest
interest
of
his
predicament
dwell
deep
in
the
fact
that
his
repudiation
of
the
great
obvious
great
moral
or
functional
or
useful
character
shall
just
have
to
consent
to
resemble
a
surrender
for
absolutely
nothing
those
characters
are
all
large
and
expansive
seated
and
established
and
endowed
whereas
the
most
charming
truth
about
the
preference
for
art
is
that
to
parade
abroad
so
thoroughly
inward
and
so
naturally
embarrassed
a
matter
is
to
falsify
and
vulgarise
it
that
as
a
preference
attended
with
the
honours
of
publicity
it
is
indeed
nowhere
that
in
fact
under
the
rule
of
its
sincerity
its
only
honours
are
those
of
contradiction
concentration
and
a
seemingly
deplorable
indifference
to
everything
but
itself
nothing
can
well
figure
as
less
big
in
an
honest
thesis
than
a
marked
instance
of
somebody
willingness
to
pass
mainly
for
an
ass
of
these
things
i
must
i
say
have
been
in
strictness
aware
what
i
perhaps
failed
of
was
to
note
that
if
a
certain
romantic
glamour
even
that
of
mere
eccentricity
or
of
a
fine
perversity
may
be
flung
over
the
act
of
exchange
of
a
career
for
the
esthetic
life
in
general
the
prose
and
the
modesty
of
the
matter
yet
come
in
with
any
exhibition
of
the
particular
branch
of
esthetics
selected
then
it
is
that
the
attitude
of
hero
or
heroine
may
look
too
much
for
the
romantic
effect
like
a
low
crouching
over
proved
trifles
art
indeed
has
in
our
day
taken
on
so
many
honours
and
emoluments
that
the
recognition
of
its
importance
is
more
than
a
custom
has
become
on
occasion
almost
a
fury
the
line
is
drawn
especially
in
the
english
world
only
at
the
importance
of
heeding
what
it
may
mean
the
more
i
turn
my
pieces
over
at
any
rate
the
more
i
now
see
i
must
have
found
in
them
and
i
remember
how
once
well
in
presence
of
my
three
typical
examples
my
fear
of
too
ample
a
canvas
quite
dropped
the
only
question
was
that
if
i
had
marked
my
political
case
from
so
far
back
for
a
story
by
itself
and
then
marked
my
theatrical
case
for
another
the
joining
together
of
these
interests
originally
seen
as
separate
might
all
disgracefully
betray
the
seam
show
for
mechanical
and
superficial
a
story
was
a
story
a
picture
a
picture
and
i
had
a
mortal
horror
of
two
stories
two
pictures
in
one
the
reason
of
this
was
the
clearest
my
subject
was
immediately
under
that
disadvantage
so
cheated
of
its
indispensable
centre
as
to
become
of
no
more
use
for
expressing
a
main
intention
than
a
wheel
without
a
hub
is
of
use
for
moving
a
cart
it
was
a
fact
apparently
that
one
on
occasion
seen
two
pictures
in
one
were
there
not
for
instance
certain
sublime
tintorettos
at
venice
a
measureless
crucifixion
in
especial
which
showed
without
loss
of
authority
actions
separately
taking
place
yes
that
might
be
but
there
had
surely
been
nevertheless
a
mighty
pictorial
fusion
so
that
the
virtue
of
composition
had
somehow
thereby
come
all
mysteriously
to
its
own
of
course
the
affair
would
be
simple
enough
if
composition
could
be
kept
out
of
the
question
yet
by
what
art
or
process
what
bars
and
bolts
what
unmuzzled
dogs
and
pointed
guns
perform
that
feat
i
had
to
know
myself
utterly
inapt
for
any
such
valour
and
recognise
that
to
make
it
possible
sundry
things
should
have
begun
for
me
much
further
back
than
i
had
felt
them
even
in
their
dawn
a
picture
without
composition
slights
its
most
precious
chance
for
beauty
and
is
moreover
not
composed
at
all
unless
the
painter
knows
that
principle
of
health
and
safety
working
as
an
absolutely
premeditated
art
has
prevailed
there
may
in
its
absence
be
life
incontestably
as
has
life
as
trois
as
tolstoi
and
have
it
but
what
do
such
large
loose
baggy
monsters
with
their
queer
elements
of
the
accidental
and
the
arbitrary
artistically
we
have
heard
it
maintained
we
well
remember
that
such
things
are
superior
to
art
but
we
understand
least
of
all
what
may
mean
and
we
look
in
vain
for
the
artist
the
divine
explanatory
genius
who
will
come
to
our
aid
and
tell
us
there
is
life
and
life
and
as
waste
is
only
life
sacrificed
and
thereby
prevented
from
counting
i
delight
in
a
economy
and
an
organic
form
my
business
was
accordingly
to
go
in
for
complete
pictorial
fusion
some
such
common
interest
between
my
two
first
notions
as
would
in
spite
of
their
birth
under
quite
different
stars
do
them
no
violence
at
all
i
recall
with
this
confirmed
infatuation
of
retrospect
that
through
the
mild
perceptions
i
here
glance
at
there
struck
for
tragic
the
first
hour
of
a
season
of
no
small
subjective
felicity
lighted
mainly
i
seem
to
see
by
a
wide
west
window
that
high
aloft
looked
over
near
and
far
london
sunsets
a
expanse
of
london
life
the
production
of
the
thing
which
yet
took
a
good
many
months
lives
for
me
again
all
contemporaneously
in
that
full
projection
upon
my
very
table
of
the
good
kensington
mornings
which
had
a
way
indeed
of
seeing
the
sunset
in
and
which
at
the
very
last
are
merged
to
memory
in
a
different
and
a
sharper
pressure
that
of
an
hotel
bedroom
in
paris
during
the
autumn
of
with
the
exposition
du
centenaire
about
to
end
and
my
long
story
through
the
usual
difficulties
as
well
the
usual
difficulties
and
i
fairly
cherish
the
record
as
some
adventurer
in
another
line
may
hug
the
sense
of
his
inveterate
habit
of
just
saving
in
time
the
neck
he
ever
undiscourageably
risks
were
those
bequeathed
as
a
particular
vice
of
the
artistic
spirit
against
which
vigilance
had
been
destined
from
the
first
to
exert
itself
in
vain
and
the
effect
of
which
was
that
again
and
again
perversely
incurably
the
centre
of
my
structure
would
insist
on
placing
itself
so
to
speak
in
the
middle
it
mattered
little
that
the
reader
with
the
idea
or
the
suspicion
of
a
structural
centre
is
the
rarest
of
friends
and
of
critics
a
bird
it
would
seem
as
merely
fabled
as
the
phoenix
the
terminational
terror
was
none
the
less
certain
to
break
in
and
my
work
threaten
to
masquerade
for
me
as
an
active
figure
condemned
to
the
disgrace
of
legs
too
short
ever
so
much
too
short
for
its
body
i
urge
myself
to
the
candid
confession
that
in
very
few
of
my
productions
to
my
eye
the
organic
centre
succeeded
in
getting
into
proper
position
time
after
time
then
has
the
precious
waistband
or
girdle
studded
and
buckled
and
placed
for
brave
outward
show
practically
worked
itself
and
in
spite
of
desperate
remonstrance
or
in
other
words
essential
counterplotting
to
a
point
perilously
near
the
knees
perilously
i
mean
for
the
freedom
of
these
parts
in
several
of
my
compositions
this
displacement
has
so
succeeded
at
the
crisis
in
defying
and
resisting
me
has
appeared
so
fraught
with
probable
dishonour
that
i
still
turn
upon
them
in
spite
of
the
greater
or
less
success
of
final
dissimulation
a
rueful
and
wondering
eye
these
productions
have
in
fact
if
i
may
be
so
bold
about
it
specious
and
spurious
centres
altogether
to
make
up
for
the
failure
of
the
true
as
to
which
in
my
list
they
are
however
that
is
another
business
not
on
any
terms
to
be
made
known
such
at
least
would
seem
my
resolution
so
far
as
i
have
thus
proceeded
of
any
attention
ever
arrested
by
the
pages
forming
the
object
of
this
reference
that
rigour
of
discrimination
has
wholly
and
consistently
failed
i
gather
to
constitute
a
part
in
which
fact
there
is
perhaps
after
all
a
rough
justice
since
the
infirmity
i
speak
of
for
example
has
been
always
but
the
direct
and
immediate
fruit
of
a
positive
excess
of
foresight
the
overdone
desire
to
provide
for
future
need
and
lay
up
heavenly
treasure
against
the
demands
of
my
climax
if
the
art
of
the
drama
as
a
great
french
master
of
it
has
said
is
above
all
the
art
of
preparations
that
is
true
only
to
a
less
extent
of
the
art
of
the
novel
and
true
exactly
in
the
degree
in
which
the
art
of
the
particular
novel
comes
near
that
of
the
drama
the
first
half
of
a
fiction
insists
ever
on
figuring
to
me
as
the
stage
or
theatre
for
the
second
half
and
i
have
in
general
given
so
much
space
to
making
the
theatre
propitious
that
my
halves
have
too
often
proved
strangely
unequal
thereby
has
arisen
with
grim
regularity
the
question
of
artfully
of
consummately
masking
the
fault
and
conferring
on
the
false
quantity
the
brave
appearance
of
the
true
but
i
am
far
from
pretending
that
these
desperations
of
ingenuity
have
not
as
through
seeming
of
the
very
essence
of
the
problem
their
exasperated
charm
so
far
from
it
that
my
particular
supreme
predicament
in
the
paris
hotel
after
an
undue
primary
leakage
of
time
no
doubt
over
at
the
great
museum
of
the
champ
de
mars
and
the
trocadero
fairly
takes
on
to
me
now
the
tender
grace
of
a
day
that
is
dead
the
last
chapters
of
tragic
i
catch
again
the
very
odour
of
paris
which
comes
up
in
the
rich
rumble
of
the
rue
de
la
paix
with
which
my
room
itself
for
that
matter
seems
impregnated
and
which
hangs
for
reminiscence
about
the
embarrassed
effort
to
finish
not
ignobly
within
my
already
exceeded
limits
an
effort
prolonged
each
day
to
those
late
afternoon
hours
during
which
the
tone
of
the
terrible
city
seemed
to
deepen
about
one
to
an
effect
strangely
composed
at
once
of
the
auspicious
and
the
fatal
the
plot
of
paris
thickened
at
such
hours
beyond
any
other
plot
in
the
world
i
think
but
there
one
sat
meanwhile
with
another
on
one
hands
absolutely
requiring
precedence
not
the
least
imperative
of
conditions
was
thus
that
one
should
have
really
should
have
finely
and
given
one
scale
concisely
treated
one
subject
in
spite
of
there
being
so
much
of
the
confounded
irreducible
quantity
still
to
treat
if
i
spoke
just
now
however
of
the
exasperated
charm
of
supreme
difficulty
that
is
because
the
challenge
of
economic
representation
so
easily
becomes
in
any
of
the
arts
intensely
interesting
to
meet
to
put
all
that
is
possible
of
one
idea
into
a
form
and
compass
that
will
contain
and
express
it
only
by
delicate
adjustments
and
an
exquisite
chemistry
so
that
there
will
at
the
end
be
neither
a
drop
of
liquor
left
nor
a
hair
breadth
of
the
rim
of
one
glass
to
spare
every
artist
will
remember
how
often
that
sort
of
necessity
has
carried
with
it
its
particular
inspiration
therein
lies
the
secret
of
the
appeal
to
his
mind
of
the
successfully
thing
where
representation
is
arrived
at
as
i
have
already
elsewhere
had
occasion
to
urge
not
by
the
addition
of
items
a
light
that
has
for
its
attendant
shadow
a
possible
dryness
but
by
the
art
of
figuring
synthetically
a
compactness
into
which
the
imagination
may
cut
thick
as
into
the
rich
density
of
the
moral
of
all
which
indeed
i
fear
is
perhaps
too
trivially
but
that
the
thick
the
false
the
dissembling
second
half
of
the
work
before
me
associated
throughout
with
the
effort
to
weight
my
dramatic
values
as
heavily
as
might
be
since
they
had
to
be
so
few
presents
that
effort
as
at
the
very
last
a
quite
convulsive
yet
in
its
way
highly
agreeable
spasm
of
such
mild
prodigies
is
the
history
of
any
specific
creative
effort
composed
but
i
have
got
too
much
out
of
the
old
kensington
light
of
twenty
years
ago
a
lingering
oblique
ray
of
which
surely
quite
extinct
played
for
a
benediction
over
my
canvas
from
the
moment
i
made
out
at
my
west
window
my
lucky
title
that
is
from
the
moment
miriam
rooth
herself
had
given
it
me
so
this
young
woman
had
given
me
with
it
her
own
position
in
the
book
and
so
that
in
turn
had
given
me
my
precious
unity
to
which
no
more
than
miriam
was
either
nick
dormer
or
peter
sherringham
to
be
sacrificed
much
of
the
interest
of
the
matter
was
immediately
therefore
in
working
out
the
detail
of
that
unity
and
always
entrancing
range
of
questions
the
order
the
reason
the
relation
of
presented
aspects
with
three
aspects
that
of
miriam
case
that
of
nick
and
that
of
sherringham
there
was
work
in
plenty
cut
out
since
happy
as
it
might
be
to
say
my
several
actions
beautifully
become
one
the
point
of
the
affair
would
be
in
them
beautifully
become
so
without
which
showing
foul
failure
hovered
and
pounced
well
the
pleasure
of
handling
an
action
or
otherwise
expressed
of
a
story
is
at
the
worst
for
a
storyteller
immense
and
the
interest
of
such
a
question
as
for
example
keeping
nick
dormer
story
his
and
yet
making
it
also
and
all
effectively
in
a
large
part
peter
sherringham
of
keeping
sherringham
his
and
yet
making
it
in
its
high
degree
his
kinsman
too
and
miriam
rooth
into
the
bargain
just
as
miriam
rooth
is
by
the
same
token
quite
operatively
his
and
nick
and
just
as
that
of
each
of
the
young
men
by
an
equal
logic
is
very
contributively
hers
the
interest
of
such
a
question
i
say
is
ever
so
considerably
the
interest
of
the
system
on
which
the
whole
thing
is
done
i
see
that
it
was
but
half
a
system
to
say
oh
miriam
a
case
herself
is
the
between
the
two
other
cases
that
device
was
to
ask
for
as
much
help
as
it
gave
and
to
require
a
good
deal
more
application
than
it
announced
on
the
surface
the
sense
of
a
system
saves
the
painter
from
the
baseness
of
the
stroke
the
touch
without
its
reason
but
as
payment
for
that
service
the
process
insists
on
being
kept
impeccably
the
right
one
these
are
intimate
truths
indeed
of
which
the
charm
mainly
comes
out
but
on
experiment
and
in
practice
yet
i
like
to
have
it
well
before
me
here
that
after
all
tragic
makes
it
not
easy
to
say
which
of
the
situations
concerned
in
it
predominates
and
rules
what
has
become
in
that
imperfect
order
accordingly
of
the
famous
centre
of
one
subject
it
is
surely
not
in
nick
consciousness
since
why
if
it
be
are
we
treated
to
such
an
intolerable
dose
of
sherringham
it
ca
be
in
sherringham
we
have
for
that
altogether
an
excess
of
nick
how
on
the
other
hand
can
it
be
in
miriam
given
that
we
have
no
direct
exhibition
of
hers
whatever
that
we
get
at
it
all
inferentially
and
inductively
seeing
it
only
through
a
more
or
less
bewildered
interpretation
of
it
by
others
the
emphasis
is
all
on
an
absolutely
objective
miriam
and
this
affirmed
how
with
such
an
amount
of
exposed
subjectivity
all
round
her
can
so
dense
a
medium
be
a
centre
such
questions
as
those
go
straight
thanks
to
which
they
are
i
profess
delightful
going
straight
they
are
of
the
sort
that
makes
answers
possible
miriam
central
then
to
analysis
in
spite
of
being
objective
central
in
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
whole
thing
has
visibly
from
the
first
to
get
itself
done
in
dramatic
or
at
least
in
scenic
conditions
though
scenic
conditions
which
are
as
near
an
approach
to
the
dramatic
as
the
novel
may
permit
itself
and
which
have
this
in
common
with
the
latter
that
they
move
in
the
light
of
this
imposes
a
consistency
other
than
that
of
the
novel
at
its
loosest
and
for
one
subject
a
different
view
and
a
different
placing
of
the
centre
the
charm
of
the
scenic
consistency
the
consistency
of
the
multiplication
of
that
of
making
them
amusingly
various
had
haunted
the
author
of
tragic
from
far
back
and
he
was
in
due
course
to
yield
to
it
all
luxuriously
too
luxuriously
perhaps
in
awkward
as
will
doubtless
with
the
extension
of
these
remarks
be
complacently
shown
to
put
himself
at
any
rate
as
much
as
possible
under
the
protection
of
it
had
been
ever
his
practice
he
had
notably
done
so
in
princess
so
frankly
panoramic
and
processional
and
in
what
case
could
this
protection
have
had
more
price
than
in
the
one
before
us
no
character
in
a
play
any
play
not
a
mere
monologue
has
for
the
right
expression
of
the
thing
a
consciousness
the
consciousness
of
others
is
exhibited
exactly
in
the
same
way
as
that
of
the
hero
the
prodigious
consciousness
of
hamlet
the
most
capacious
and
most
crowded
the
moral
presence
the
most
asserted
in
the
whole
range
of
fiction
only
takes
its
turn
with
that
of
the
other
agents
of
the
story
no
matter
how
occasional
these
may
be
it
is
left
in
other
words
to
answer
for
itself
equally
with
theirs
wherefore
by
a
parity
of
reasoning
if
not
of
example
miriam
might
without
inconsequence
be
placed
on
the
same
footing
and
all
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
moral
presence
of
each
of
the
men
most
importantly
concerned
with
her
or
with
the
second
of
whom
she
at
least
is
importantly
concerned
independently
answered
for
the
idea
of
the
book
being
as
i
have
said
a
picture
of
some
of
the
personal
consequences
of
the
raised
to
intensity
swollen
to
voracity
the
heavy
emphasis
falls
where
the
symbol
of
some
of
the
complications
so
begotten
might
be
made
as
i
judged
heaven
forgive
me
most
amusing
amusing
i
mean
in
the
best
very
modern
sense
i
never
go
behind
miriam
only
poor
sherringham
goes
a
great
deal
and
nick
dormer
goes
a
little
and
the
author
while
they
so
waste
wonderment
goes
behind
but
none
the
less
she
is
as
thoroughly
symbolic
as
functional
for
illustration
of
the
idea
as
either
of
them
while
her
image
had
seemed
susceptible
of
a
livelier
and
prettier
concretion
i
had
desired
for
her
i
remember
all
manageable
vividness
so
ineluctable
had
it
long
appeared
to
do
the
actress
to
touch
the
theatre
to
meet
that
connexion
somehow
or
other
in
any
free
plunge
of
the
speculative
fork
into
the
contemporary
social
salad
the
late
stevenson
was
to
write
to
me
i
recall
and
precisely
on
the
occasion
of
tragic
that
he
was
at
a
loss
to
conceive
how
one
could
find
an
interest
in
anything
so
vulgar
or
pretend
to
gather
fruit
in
so
scrubby
an
orchard
but
the
view
of
a
creature
of
the
stage
the
view
of
the
histrionic
temperament
as
suggestive
much
less
verily
in
respect
to
the
poor
stage
than
in
respect
to
art
at
large
affected
me
in
spite
of
that
as
justly
tenable
an
objection
of
a
more
pointed
order
was
forced
upon
me
by
an
acute
friend
later
on
and
in
another
connexion
the
challenge
of
one
right
in
any
pretended
show
of
social
realities
to
attach
to
the
image
of
a
public
character
a
supposed
particular
celebrity
a
range
of
interest
of
intrinsic
distinction
greater
than
any
such
display
of
importance
on
the
part
of
eminent
members
of
the
class
as
we
see
them
about
us
there
a
nice
point
if
one
would
yet
only
nice
enough
after
all
to
be
easily
amusing
we
shall
deal
with
it
later
on
however
in
a
more
urgent
connexion
what
would
have
worried
me
much
more
had
it
dawned
earlier
is
the
light
lately
thrown
by
that
admirable
writer
anatole
france
on
the
question
of
any
animated
view
of
the
histrionic
temperament
a
light
that
may
well
dazzle
to
distress
any
ingenuous
worker
in
the
same
field
in
those
parts
of
his
brief
but
inimitable
on
which
he
is
most
to
be
congratulated
for
there
are
some
that
prompt
to
reserves
he
has
done
the
actress
as
well
as
the
actor
done
above
all
the
mountebank
the
mummer
and
the
and
mixed
them
up
with
the
queer
theatric
air
in
a
manner
that
practically
warns
all
other
hands
off
the
material
for
ever
at
the
same
time
i
think
i
saw
miriam
and
without
a
sacrifice
of
truth
that
is
of
the
particular
glow
of
verisimilitude
i
wished
her
most
to
benefit
by
in
a
complexity
of
relations
finer
than
any
that
appear
possible
for
the
gentry
of
anatole
france
her
relation
to
nick
dormer
for
instance
was
intended
as
a
superior
interest
that
of
being
while
perfectly
sincere
sincere
for
and
therefore
perfectly
consonant
with
her
impulse
perpetually
to
perform
and
with
her
success
in
performing
the
result
of
a
touched
imagination
a
touched
pride
for
art
as
well
as
of
the
charm
cast
on
other
sensibilities
still
dormer
relation
to
herself
is
a
different
matter
of
which
more
presently
but
the
sympathy
she
poor
young
woman
very
generously
and
intelligently
offers
him
where
most
people
have
so
stinted
it
is
disclosed
largely
at
the
cost
of
her
egotism
and
her
personal
pretensions
even
though
in
fact
determined
by
her
sense
of
their
together
nick
and
she
postponing
the
world
to
their
conception
of
other
and
finer
decencies
nick
ca
on
the
whole
see
for
i
have
represented
him
as
in
his
day
quite
sufficiently
troubled
and
anxious
why
he
should
condemn
to
ugly
feebleness
his
most
prized
faculty
most
prized
at
least
by
himself
even
in
order
to
keep
his
seat
in
parliament
to
inherit
carteret
blessing
and
money
to
gratify
his
mother
and
carry
out
the
mission
of
his
father
to
marry
julia
dallow
in
fine
a
beautiful
imperative
woman
with
a
great
many
thousands
a
year
it
all
comes
back
in
the
last
analysis
to
the
individual
vision
of
decency
the
critical
as
well
as
the
passionate
judgement
of
it
under
sharp
stress
and
nick
vision
and
judgement
all
on
the
esthetic
ground
have
beautifully
coincided
to
imagination
with
a
now
fully
marked
an
inspired
and
impenitent
choice
of
her
own
so
that
other
considerations
powerfully
aiding
indeed
she
is
ready
to
see
their
interest
all
splendidly
as
one
she
is
in
the
uplifted
state
to
which
sacrifices
and
submissions
loom
large
but
loom
so
just
because
they
must
write
sympathy
write
passion
large
her
measure
of
what
she
would
be
capable
of
for
him
capable
that
is
of
asking
of
him
will
depend
on
what
he
shall
ask
of
but
she
has
no
fear
of
not
being
able
to
satisfy
him
even
to
the
point
of
chucking
for
him
if
need
be
that
artistic
identity
of
her
own
which
she
has
begun
to
build
up
it
will
all
be
to
the
glory
therefore
of
their
common
infatuation
with
art
she
will
doubtless
be
no
less
willing
to
serve
his
than
she
was
eager
to
serve
her
own
purged
now
of
the
too
great
shrillness
this
puts
her
quite
on
a
different
level
from
that
of
the
vivid
monsters
of
france
whose
artistic
identity
is
the
last
thing
wish
to
chuck
their
only
dismissal
is
of
all
material
and
social
nick
dormer
in
point
of
fact
asks
of
miriam
nothing
but
that
she
shall
remain
awfully
interesting
to
paint
but
that
is
relation
which
as
i
say
is
quite
a
matter
by
itself
he
at
any
rate
luckily
for
both
of
them
it
may
be
does
put
her
to
the
test
he
is
so
busy
with
his
own
case
busy
with
testing
himself
and
feeling
his
reality
he
has
seen
himself
as
giving
up
precious
things
for
an
object
and
that
object
has
somehow
not
been
the
young
woman
in
question
nor
anything
very
nearly
like
her
she
on
the
other
hand
has
asked
everything
of
peter
sherringham
who
has
asked
everything
of
and
it
is
in
so
doing
that
she
has
really
most
testified
for
art
and
invited
him
to
testify
with
his
professed
interest
in
the
theatre
one
of
those
deep
subjections
that
in
men
of
taste
the
comédie
française
used
in
old
days
to
conspire
for
and
some
such
odd
and
affecting
examples
of
which
were
to
be
noted
he
yet
offers
her
his
hand
and
an
introduction
to
the
very
best
society
if
she
will
leave
the
stage
the
power
and
her
having
the
sense
of
the
power
to
shine
in
the
world
is
his
highest
measure
of
her
the
test
applied
by
him
to
her
beautiful
human
value
just
as
the
manner
in
which
she
turns
on
him
is
the
application
of
her
own
standard
and
touchstone
she
is
perfectly
sure
of
her
own
for
if
there
were
nothing
else
and
there
is
much
she
has
tasted
blood
so
to
speak
in
the
form
of
her
so
prompt
and
auspicious
success
with
the
public
leaving
all
probations
behind
the
whole
of
which
as
the
book
gives
it
is
too
rapid
and
sudden
though
inevitably
so
processes
periods
intervals
stages
degrees
connexions
may
be
easily
enough
and
barely
enough
named
may
be
unconvincingly
stated
in
fiction
to
the
deep
discredit
of
the
writer
but
it
remains
the
very
deuce
to
them
especially
represent
them
under
strong
compression
and
in
brief
and
subordinate
terms
and
this
even
though
the
novelist
who
represent
and
represent
all
the
time
is
lost
exactly
as
much
lost
as
the
painter
who
at
his
work
and
given
his
intention
does
paint
all
the
time
turn
upon
her
friend
at
any
rate
miriam
does
and
one
of
my
main
points
is
missed
if
it
fails
to
appear
that
she
does
so
with
absolute
sincerity
and
with
the
cold
passion
of
the
high
critic
who
knows
on
sight
of
them
together
the
more
or
less
dazzling
false
from
the
comparatively
true
sherringham
whole
profession
has
been
that
he
rejoices
in
her
as
she
is
and
that
the
theatre
the
organised
theatre
will
be
as
matthew
arnold
was
in
those
very
days
pronouncing
it
irresistible
and
it
is
the
promptness
with
which
he
sheds
his
pretended
faith
as
soon
as
it
feels
in
the
air
the
breath
of
reality
as
soon
as
it
asks
of
him
a
proof
or
a
sacrifice
it
is
this
that
excites
her
doubtless
sufficiently
arrogant
scorn
where
is
the
virtue
of
his
high
interest
if
it
has
verily
never
an
interest
to
speak
of
and
if
all
it
has
suddenly
to
suggest
is
that
in
face
of
a
serious
call
it
shall
be
unblushingly
relinquished
if
he
and
she
together
and
her
great
field
and
future
and
the
whole
cause
they
had
armed
and
declared
for
have
not
been
serious
things
they
have
been
base
and
trivialities
which
is
what
in
fact
the
homage
of
society
to
art
always
turns
out
so
soon
as
art
presumes
not
to
be
vulgar
and
futile
it
is
immensely
the
fashion
and
immensely
edifying
to
listen
to
this
homage
while
it
confines
its
attention
to
vanities
and
frauds
but
it
knows
only
terror
feels
only
horror
the
moment
that
instead
of
making
all
the
concessions
art
proceeds
to
ask
for
a
few
miriam
is
nothing
if
not
strenuous
and
evidently
nothing
if
not
cheeky
where
sherringham
is
concerned
at
least
these
in
the
exhibition
to
which
she
is
condemned
are
the
very
elements
of
her
figure
and
the
very
colours
of
her
portrait
but
she
is
mild
and
inconsequent
for
nick
dormer
who
demands
of
her
so
little
as
if
gravely
and
pityingly
embracing
the
truth
that
sacrifice
on
the
right
side
is
probably
to
have
very
little
of
her
sort
of
recompense
i
must
have
had
it
well
before
me
that
she
was
all
aware
of
the
small
strain
a
great
sacrifice
to
nick
would
cost
her
by
reason
of
the
strong
effect
on
her
of
his
own
superior
logic
in
which
the
very
intensity
of
concentration
was
so
to
find
its
account
if
the
man
however
who
holds
her
personally
dear
yet
holds
her
extremely
personal
message
to
the
world
cheap
so
the
man
capable
of
a
consistency
and
as
she
regards
the
matter
of
an
honesty
so
much
higher
than
sherringham
virtually
cares
really
cares
no
straw
for
his
if
nick
dormer
attracts
and
holds
her
it
is
because
like
herself
and
unlike
peter
he
puts
art
first
but
the
most
he
thus
does
for
her
in
the
event
is
to
let
her
see
how
she
may
enjoy
in
intimacy
the
rigour
it
has
taught
him
and
which
he
cultivates
at
her
expense
this
is
the
situation
in
which
we
leave
her
though
there
would
be
more
still
to
be
said
about
the
difference
for
her
of
the
two
relations
that
to
each
of
the
men
could
i
fondly
suppose
as
much
of
the
interest
of
the
book
left
over
for
the
reader
as
for
myself
sherringham
for
instance
offers
miriam
marriage
ever
so
handsomely
but
if
nothing
might
lead
me
on
further
than
the
question
of
what
it
would
have
been
open
to
us
us
novelists
especially
in
the
old
days
to
show
serially
a
young
man
in
nick
dormer
quite
different
position
as
offering
or
a
young
woman
in
miriam
as
taking
so
for
that
very
reason
such
an
excursion
is
forbidden
me
the
trade
of
the
and
above
all
of
the
actress
must
have
so
many
detestable
sides
for
the
person
exercising
it
that
we
scarce
imagine
a
full
surrender
to
it
without
a
full
surrender
not
less
to
every
immediate
compensation
to
every
freedom
and
the
largest
ease
within
reach
which
presentment
of
the
possible
case
for
miriam
would
yet
have
been
condemned
and
on
grounds
both
various
and
interesting
to
trace
to
remain
very
imperfect
i
feel
moreover
that
i
might
still
with
space
abound
in
remarks
about
nick
character
and
nick
crisis
suggested
to
my
present
more
reflective
vision
it
strikes
me
alas
that
he
is
not
quite
so
interesting
as
he
was
fondly
intended
to
be
and
this
in
spite
of
the
multiplication
within
the
picture
of
his
pains
and
penalties
so
that
while
i
turn
this
slight
anomaly
over
i
come
upon
a
reason
that
affects
me
as
singularly
charming
and
touching
and
at
which
indeed
i
have
already
glanced
any
presentation
of
the
artist
must
be
flat
in
proportion
as
it
really
sticks
to
its
subject
it
can
only
smuggle
in
relief
and
variety
for
to
put
the
matter
in
an
image
all
we
then
in
his
triumph
see
of
the
is
the
back
he
turns
to
us
as
he
bends
over
his
work
his
triumph
decently
is
but
the
triumph
of
what
he
produces
and
that
is
another
affair
his
romance
is
the
romance
he
himself
projects
he
eats
the
cake
of
the
very
rarest
privilege
the
most
luscious
baked
in
the
oven
of
the
gods
therefore
he
may
have
it
in
the
form
of
the
privilege
of
the
hero
at
the
same
time
the
privilege
of
the
hero
that
is
of
the
martyr
or
of
the
interesting
and
appealing
and
comparatively
floundering
places
him
in
quite
a
different
category
belongs
to
him
only
as
to
the
artist
deluded
diverted
frustrated
or
vanquished
when
the
amateur
in
him
gains
for
our
admiration
or
compassion
or
whatever
all
that
the
expert
has
to
do
without
therefore
i
strove
in
vain
i
feel
to
embroil
and
adorn
this
young
man
on
whom
a
hundred
ingenious
touches
are
thus
lavished
he
has
insisted
in
the
event
on
looking
as
simple
and
flat
as
some
mere
brass
check
or
engraved
number
the
symbol
and
guarantee
of
a
stored
treasure
the
better
part
of
him
is
locked
too
much
away
from
us
and
the
part
we
see
has
to
pass
for
well
what
it
passes
for
so
lamentedly
among
his
friends
and
relatives
no
accordingly
nick
dormer
is
the
best
thing
in
the
book
as
i
judge
i
imagined
he
would
be
and
it
contains
nothing
better
i
make
out
than
that
preserved
and
achieved
unity
and
quality
of
tone
a
value
in
itself
which
i
referred
to
at
the
beginning
of
these
remarks
what
i
mean
by
this
is
that
the
interest
created
and
the
expression
of
that
interest
are
things
kept
as
to
kind
genuine
and
true
to
themselves
the
appeal
the
fidelity
to
the
prime
motive
is
with
no
little
art
strained
clear
even
as
silver
is
polished
in
a
degree
answering
at
least
by
intention
to
the
air
of
beauty
there
is
an
awkwardness
again
in
having
thus
belatedly
to
point
such
features
out
but
in
that
wrought
appearance
of
animation
and
harmony
that
effect
of
free
movement
and
yet
of
recurrent
and
insistent
reference
tragic
has
struck
me
again
as
conscious
of
a
bright
advantage
henry
james
book
first
i
the
people
of
france
have
made
it
no
secret
that
those
of
england
as
a
general
thing
are
to
their
perception
an
inexpressive
and
speechless
race
perpendicular
and
unsociable
unaddicted
to
enriching
any
bareness
of
contact
with
verbal
or
other
embroidery
this
view
might
have
derived
encouragement
a
few
years
ago
in
paris
from
the
manner
in
which
four
persons
sat
together
in
silence
one
fine
day
about
noon
in
the
garden
as
it
is
called
of
the
palais
de
the
central
court
of
the
great
glazed
bazaar
where
among
plants
and
parterres
gravelled
walks
and
thin
fountains
are
ranged
the
figures
and
groups
the
monuments
and
busts
which
form
in
the
annual
exhibition
of
the
salon
the
department
of
statuary
the
spirit
of
observation
is
naturally
high
at
the
salon
quickened
by
a
thousand
artful
or
artless
appeals
but
it
need
have
put
forth
no
great
intensity
to
take
in
the
characters
i
mention
as
a
solicitation
of
the
eye
on
definite
grounds
these
visitors
too
constituted
a
successful
plastic
fact
and
even
the
most
superficial
observer
would
have
marked
them
as
products
of
an
insular
neighbourhood
representatives
of
that
class
with
which
on
the
recurrent
occasions
when
the
english
turn
out
for
a
holiday
christmas
and
easter
whitsuntide
and
the
autumn
paris
besprinkles
itself
at
a
night
notice
they
had
about
them
the
indefinable
professional
look
of
the
british
traveller
abroad
the
air
of
preparation
for
exposure
material
and
moral
which
is
so
oddly
combined
with
the
serene
revelation
of
security
and
of
persistence
and
which
excites
according
to
individual
susceptibility
the
ire
or
the
admiration
of
foreign
communities
they
were
the
more
unmistakable
as
they
presented
mainly
the
happier
aspects
of
the
energetic
race
to
which
they
had
the
honour
to
belong
the
fresh
diffused
light
of
the
salon
made
them
clear
and
important
they
were
finished
creations
in
their
way
and
ranged
there
motionless
on
their
green
bench
were
almost
as
much
on
exhibition
as
if
they
had
been
hung
on
the
line
three
ladies
and
a
young
man
they
were
obviously
a
family
a
mother
two
daughters
and
a
son
a
circumstance
which
had
the
effect
at
once
of
making
each
member
of
the
group
doubly
typical
and
of
helping
to
account
for
their
fine
taciturnity
they
were
not
with
each
other
on
terms
of
ceremony
and
also
were
probably
fatigued
with
their
course
among
the
pictures
the
rooms
on
the
upper
floor
their
attitude
on
the
part
of
visitors
who
had
superior
features
even
if
they
might
appear
to
some
to
have
neglected
a
fine
opportunity
for
completing
these
features
with
an
expression
was
after
all
a
kind
of
tribute
to
the
state
of
exhaustion
of
bewilderment
to
which
the
genius
of
france
is
still
capable
of
reducing
the
proud
en
des
abrutis
more
than
one
of
their
might
have
been
heard
to
exclaim
and
certain
it
is
that
there
was
something
depressed
and
discouraged
in
this
interesting
group
who
sat
looking
vaguely
before
them
not
noticing
the
life
of
the
place
somewhat
as
if
each
had
a
private
anxiety
it
might
have
been
finely
guessed
however
that
though
on
many
questions
they
were
closely
united
this
present
anxiety
was
not
the
same
for
each
if
they
looked
grave
moreover
this
was
doubtless
partly
the
result
of
their
all
being
dressed
in
such
mourning
as
told
of
a
recent
bereavement
the
eldest
of
the
three
ladies
had
indeed
a
face
of
a
fine
austere
mould
which
would
have
been
moved
to
gaiety
only
by
some
force
more
insidious
than
any
she
was
likely
to
recognise
in
paris
cold
still
and
considerably
worn
it
was
neither
stupid
nor
hard
it
was
firm
narrow
and
sharp
this
competent
matron
acquainted
evidently
with
grief
but
not
weakened
by
it
had
a
high
forehead
to
which
the
quality
of
the
skin
gave
a
singular
polish
it
glittered
even
when
seen
at
a
distance
a
nose
which
achieved
a
high
free
curve
and
a
tendency
to
throw
back
her
head
and
carry
it
well
above
her
as
if
to
disengage
it
from
the
possible
entanglements
of
the
rest
of
her
person
if
you
had
seen
her
walk
you
would
have
felt
her
to
tread
the
earth
after
a
fashion
suggesting
that
in
a
world
where
she
had
long
since
discovered
that
one
could
have
one
own
way
one
could
never
tell
what
annoying
aggression
might
take
place
so
that
it
was
well
from
hour
to
hour
to
save
what
one
could
lady
agnes
saved
her
head
her
white
triangular
forehead
over
which
her
flaxen
hair
reproduced
in
different
shades
in
her
children
made
a
looped
silken
canopy
like
the
marquee
at
a
her
daughters
were
as
tall
as
herself
that
was
visible
even
as
they
sat
there
and
one
of
them
the
younger
evidently
altogether
pretty
a
straight
slender
english
girl
of
the
sort
who
show
good
figures
and
fresh
complexions
the
sister
who
was
not
pretty
was
also
straight
and
slender
and
but
the
grey
in
this
case
was
not
so
pure
nor
were
the
straightness
and
the
slenderness
so
maidenly
the
brother
of
these
young
ladies
had
taken
off
his
hat
as
if
he
felt
the
air
of
the
summer
day
heavy
in
the
great
pavilion
he
was
a
lean
strong
youth
with
a
formed
nose
and
thick
hair
which
lay
continuously
and
profusely
back
from
his
forehead
so
that
to
smooth
it
from
the
brow
to
the
neck
but
a
single
movement
of
the
hand
was
required
i
can
not
describe
him
better
than
by
saying
that
he
was
the
sort
of
young
englishman
who
looks
particularly
well
in
strange
lands
and
whose
general
aspect
his
inches
his
limbs
his
friendly
eyes
the
modulation
of
his
voice
the
cleanness
of
his
and
the
fashion
of
his
garments
excites
on
the
part
of
those
who
encounter
him
in
far
countries
on
the
ground
of
a
common
speech
a
delightful
sympathy
of
race
this
sympathy
may
sometimes
be
qualified
by
the
seen
limits
of
his
apprehension
but
it
almost
revels
as
such
horizons
recede
we
shall
see
quickly
enough
how
accurate
a
measure
it
might
have
taken
of
nicholas
dormer
there
was
food
for
suspicion
perhaps
in
the
wandering
blankness
that
sat
at
moments
in
his
eyes
as
if
he
had
no
attention
at
all
not
the
least
in
the
world
at
his
command
but
it
is
no
more
than
just
to
add
without
delay
that
this
discouraging
symptom
was
known
among
those
who
liked
him
by
the
indulgent
name
of
dreaminess
by
his
mother
and
sisters
for
instance
his
dreaminess
was
constantly
noted
he
is
the
more
welcome
to
the
benefit
of
such
an
interpretation
as
there
is
always
held
to
be
something
engaging
in
the
combination
of
the
muscular
and
the
musing
the
mildness
of
strength
after
some
time
an
interval
during
which
these
good
people
might
have
appeared
to
have
come
individually
to
the
palais
de
much
less
to
see
the
works
of
art
than
to
think
over
their
domestic
affairs
the
young
man
rousing
himself
from
his
reverie
addressed
one
of
the
girls
i
say
biddy
why
should
we
sit
moping
here
all
day
come
and
take
a
turn
about
with
me
his
younger
sister
while
he
got
up
leaned
forward
a
little
looking
round
her
but
she
gave
for
the
moment
no
further
sign
of
complying
with
his
invitation
where
shall
we
find
you
then
if
peter
comes
asked
the
other
miss
dormer
making
no
movement
at
all
i
daresay
peter
wo
come
he
leave
us
here
to
cool
our
heels
oh
nick
dear
biddy
exclaimed
in
a
small
sweet
voice
of
protest
it
was
plainly
her
theory
that
peter
would
come
and
even
a
little
her
fond
fear
that
she
might
miss
him
should
she
quit
that
spot
we
shall
come
back
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
really
i
must
look
at
these
things
nick
declared
turning
his
face
to
a
marble
group
which
stood
near
them
on
the
right
a
man
with
the
skin
of
a
beast
round
his
loins
tussling
with
a
naked
woman
in
some
primitive
effort
of
courtship
or
capture
lady
agnes
followed
the
direction
of
her
son
eyes
and
then
observed
everything
seems
very
dreadful
i
should
think
biddy
had
better
sit
still
has
she
seen
enough
horrors
up
above
i
daresay
that
if
peter
comes
julia
be
with
him
the
elder
girl
remarked
irrelevantly
well
then
he
can
take
julia
about
that
will
be
more
proper
said
lady
agnes
mother
dear
she
does
care
a
rap
about
art
it
a
fearful
bore
looking
at
fine
things
with
julia
nick
returned
wo
you
go
with
him
grace
and
biddy
appealed
to
her
sister
i
think
she
has
awfully
good
taste
grace
exclaimed
not
answering
this
inquiry
say
nasty
things
about
her
lady
agnes
broke
out
solemnly
to
her
son
after
resting
her
eyes
on
him
a
moment
with
an
air
of
reluctant
reprobation
i
say
nothing
but
what
she
say
herself
the
young
man
urged
about
some
things
she
has
very
good
taste
but
about
this
kind
of
thing
she
has
no
taste
at
all
that
better
i
think
said
lady
agnes
turning
her
eyes
again
to
the
kind
of
thing
her
son
appeared
to
designate
she
awfully
clever
awfully
grace
went
on
with
decision
awfully
awfully
her
brother
repeated
standing
in
front
of
her
and
smiling
down
at
her
you
are
nasty
nick
you
know
you
are
said
the
young
lady
but
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
biddy
got
up
at
this
as
if
the
accusatory
tone
prompted
her
to
place
herself
generously
at
his
side
might
you
go
and
order
lunch
in
that
place
you
know
she
asked
of
her
mother
then
we
come
back
when
it
was
ready
my
dear
child
i
ca
order
lunch
lady
agnes
replied
with
a
cold
impatience
which
seemed
to
intimate
that
she
had
problems
far
more
important
than
those
of
victualling
to
contend
with
then
perhaps
peter
will
if
he
comes
i
sure
he
up
in
everything
of
that
sort
oh
hang
peter
nick
exclaimed
leave
him
out
of
account
and
order
lunch
mother
but
not
cold
beef
and
pickles
i
must
say
about
you
not
nice
biddy
ventured
to
remark
to
her
brother
hesitating
and
even
blushing
a
little
you
make
up
for
it
my
dear
the
young
man
answered
giving
her
chin
a
very
charming
rotund
little
chin
a
friendly
whisk
with
his
forefinger
i
ca
imagine
what
you
got
against
him
her
ladyship
said
gravely
dear
mother
it
disappointed
fondness
nick
argued
they
answer
one
notes
they
wo
let
one
know
where
they
are
nor
what
to
expect
has
no
fury
like
a
woman
scorned
nor
like
a
man
either
peter
has
such
a
tremendous
lot
to
do
it
a
very
busy
time
at
the
embassy
there
are
sure
to
be
reasons
biddy
explained
with
her
pretty
eyes
reasons
enough
no
doubt
said
lady
agnes
who
accompanied
these
words
with
an
ambiguous
sigh
however
as
if
in
paris
even
the
best
reasons
would
naturally
be
bad
ones
does
julia
write
to
you
does
she
answer
you
the
very
day
grace
asked
looking
at
nick
as
if
she
were
the
bold
one
he
waited
returning
her
glance
with
a
certain
severity
what
do
you
know
about
my
correspondence
no
doubt
i
ask
too
much
he
went
on
so
attached
to
them
dear
old
peter
dear
old
julia
she
younger
than
you
my
dear
cried
the
elder
girl
still
resolute
yes
nineteen
days
i
glad
you
know
her
birthday
she
knows
yours
she
always
gives
you
something
lady
agnes
reminded
her
son
her
taste
is
good
is
it
nick
grace
dormer
continued
she
makes
charming
presents
but
dear
mother
it
is
taste
it
her
husband
how
her
husband
the
beautiful
objects
of
which
she
disposes
so
freely
are
the
things
he
collected
for
years
laboriously
devotedly
poor
man
she
disposes
of
them
to
you
but
not
to
others
said
lady
agnes
but
that
all
right
she
added
as
if
this
might
have
been
taken
for
a
complaint
of
the
limitations
of
julia
bounty
she
has
to
select
among
so
many
and
that
a
proof
of
taste
her
ladyship
pursued
you
ca
say
she
does
choose
lovely
ones
grace
remarked
to
her
brother
in
a
tone
of
some
triumph
my
dear
they
all
lovely
george
dallow
judgement
was
so
sure
he
was
incapable
of
making
a
mistake
nicholas
dormer
returned
i
do
see
how
you
can
talk
of
him
he
was
dreadful
said
lady
agnes
my
dear
if
he
was
good
enough
for
julia
to
marry
he
good
enough
for
us
to
talk
of
she
did
him
a
very
great
honour
i
daresay
but
he
was
not
unworthy
of
it
no
such
enlightened
collection
of
beautiful
objects
has
been
made
in
england
in
our
time
you
think
too
much
of
beautiful
objects
lady
agnes
sighed
i
thought
you
were
just
now
lamenting
that
i
think
too
little
it
very
nice
his
having
left
julia
so
well
off
biddy
interposed
soothingly
as
if
she
foresaw
a
tangle
he
treated
her
grand
absolutely
nick
went
on
he
used
to
look
greasy
all
the
same
grace
bore
on
it
with
a
dull
weight
his
name
ought
to
have
been
tallow
you
not
saying
what
julia
would
like
if
that
what
you
are
trying
to
say
her
brother
observed
do
be
vulgar
grace
said
lady
agnes
i
know
peter
sherringham
birthday
biddy
broke
out
innocently
as
a
pacific
diversion
she
had
passed
her
hand
into
nick
arm
to
signify
her
readiness
to
go
with
him
while
she
scanned
the
remoter
reaches
of
the
garden
as
if
it
had
occurred
to
her
that
to
direct
their
steps
in
some
such
sense
might
after
all
be
the
shorter
way
to
get
at
peter
he
too
much
older
than
you
my
dear
grace
answered
without
encouragement
that
why
i
noticed
it
he
do
you
call
that
too
old
i
do
care
for
slobbering
infants
biddy
cried
do
be
vulgar
lady
agnes
enjoined
again
come
bid
we
go
and
be
vulgar
together
for
that
what
we
are
afraid
her
brother
said
to
her
we
go
and
look
at
all
these
low
works
of
art
do
you
really
think
it
necessary
to
the
child
development
lady
agnes
demanded
as
the
pair
turned
away
and
then
while
her
son
struck
as
by
a
challenge
paused
lingering
a
moment
with
his
little
sister
on
his
arm
what
we
been
through
this
morning
in
this
place
and
what
you
paraded
before
our
eyes
the
murders
the
tortures
all
kinds
of
disease
and
indecency
nick
looked
at
his
mother
as
if
this
sudden
protest
surprised
him
but
as
if
also
there
were
lurking
explanations
of
it
which
he
quickly
guessed
her
resentment
had
the
effect
not
so
much
of
animating
her
cold
face
as
of
making
it
colder
less
expressive
though
visibly
prouder
ah
dear
mother
do
do
the
british
matron
he
replied
british
matron
soon
said
i
do
know
what
they
coming
to
how
odd
that
you
should
have
been
struck
only
with
the
disagreeable
things
when
for
myself
i
felt
it
to
be
most
interesting
the
most
suggestive
morning
i
passed
for
ever
so
many
months
oh
nick
nick
lady
agnes
cried
with
a
strange
depth
of
feeling
i
like
them
better
in
london
they
much
less
unpleasant
said
grace
dormer
they
things
you
can
look
at
her
ladyship
went
on
we
certainly
make
the
better
show
the
subject
does
matter
it
the
treatment
the
treatment
biddy
protested
in
a
voice
like
the
tinkle
of
a
silver
bell
poor
little
bid
her
brother
broke
into
a
laugh
how
can
i
learn
to
model
mamma
dear
if
i
do
look
at
things
and
if
i
do
study
them
the
girl
continued
this
question
passed
unheeded
and
nicholas
dormer
said
to
his
mother
more
seriously
but
with
a
certain
kind
explicitness
as
if
he
could
make
a
particular
allowance
this
place
is
an
immense
stimulus
to
me
it
refreshes
me
excites
me
it
such
an
exhibition
of
artistic
life
it
full
of
ideas
full
of
refinements
it
gives
one
such
an
impression
of
artistic
experience
they
try
everything
they
feel
everything
while
you
were
looking
at
the
murders
apparently
i
observed
an
immense
deal
of
curious
and
interesting
work
there
are
too
many
of
them
poor
devils
so
many
who
must
make
their
way
who
must
attract
attention
some
of
them
can
only
stand
on
their
heads
turn
somersaults
or
commit
deeds
of
violence
to
make
people
notice
them
after
that
no
doubt
a
good
many
will
be
quieter
but
i
do
know
i
in
an
appreciative
mood
i
feel
indulgent
even
to
them
they
give
me
an
impression
of
intelligence
of
eager
observation
all
art
is
one
remember
that
biddy
dear
the
young
man
continued
smiling
down
from
his
height
it
the
same
great
effort
and
any
ground
that
gained
by
an
individual
any
spark
that
struck
in
any
province
is
of
use
and
of
suggestion
to
all
the
others
we
all
in
the
same
boat
do
you
say
my
dear
are
you
really
setting
up
for
an
artist
lady
agnes
asked
nick
just
hesitated
i
was
speaking
for
biddy
but
you
one
nick
you
are
the
girl
cried
lady
agnes
looked
for
an
instant
as
if
she
were
going
to
say
once
more
do
be
vulgar
but
she
suppressed
these
words
had
she
intended
them
and
uttered
sounds
few
in
number
and
not
completely
articulate
to
the
effect
that
she
hated
talking
about
art
while
her
son
spoke
she
had
watched
him
as
if
failing
to
follow
yet
something
in
the
tone
of
her
exclamation
hinted
that
she
had
understood
him
but
too
well
we
all
in
the
same
boat
biddy
repeated
with
cheerful
zeal
not
me
if
you
please
lady
agnes
replied
it
horrid
messy
work
your
modelling
ah
but
look
at
the
results
said
the
girl
eagerly
glancing
about
at
the
monuments
in
the
garden
as
if
in
regard
even
to
them
she
were
through
that
unity
of
art
her
brother
had
just
proclaimed
in
some
degree
an
effective
cause
there
a
great
deal
being
done
here
a
real
vitality
nicholas
dormer
went
on
to
his
mother
in
the
same
reasonable
informing
way
some
of
these
fellows
go
very
far
they
do
indeed
said
lady
agnes
i
fond
of
young
schools
like
this
movement
in
sculpture
nick
insisted
with
his
slightly
provoking
serenity
they
old
enough
to
know
better
may
i
look
mamma
it
necessary
to
my
development
biddy
declared
you
may
do
as
you
like
said
lady
agnes
with
dignity
she
ought
to
see
good
work
you
know
the
young
man
went
on
i
leave
it
to
your
sense
of
responsibility
this
statement
was
somewhat
majestic
and
for
a
moment
evidently
it
tempted
nick
almost
provoked
him
or
at
any
rate
suggested
to
him
an
occasion
for
some
pronouncement
he
had
had
on
his
mind
apparently
however
he
judged
the
time
on
the
whole
not
quite
right
and
his
sister
grace
interposed
with
the
inquiry
please
mamma
are
we
never
going
to
lunch
ah
mother
mother
the
young
man
murmured
in
a
troubled
way
looking
down
at
her
with
a
deep
fold
in
his
forehead
for
lady
agnes
also
as
she
returned
his
look
it
seemed
an
occasion
but
with
this
difference
that
she
had
no
hesitation
in
taking
advantage
of
it
she
was
encouraged
by
his
slight
embarrassment
for
ordinarily
nick
was
not
embarrassed
you
used
to
have
so
sense
of
responsibility
she
pursued
but
sometimes
i
do
know
what
has
become
of
it
it
seems
all
gone
ah
mother
mother
he
exclaimed
again
as
if
there
were
so
many
things
to
say
that
it
was
impossible
to
choose
but
now
he
stepped
closer
bent
over
her
and
in
spite
of
the
publicity
of
their
situation
gave
her
a
quick
expressive
kiss
the
foreign
observer
whom
i
took
for
granted
in
beginning
to
sketch
this
scene
would
have
had
to
admit
that
the
rigid
english
family
had
after
all
a
capacity
for
emotion
grace
dormer
indeed
looked
round
her
to
see
if
at
this
moment
they
were
noticed
she
judged
with
satisfaction
that
they
had
escaped
ii
nick
dormer
walked
away
with
biddy
but
he
had
not
gone
far
before
he
stopped
in
front
of
a
clever
bust
where
his
mother
in
the
distance
saw
him
playing
in
the
air
with
his
hand
carrying
out
by
this
gesture
which
presumably
was
applausive
some
critical
remark
he
had
made
to
his
sister
lady
agnes
raised
her
glass
to
her
eyes
by
the
long
handle
to
which
rather
a
clanking
chain
was
attached
perceiving
that
the
bust
represented
an
ugly
old
man
with
a
bald
head
at
which
her
ladyship
indefinitely
sighed
though
it
was
not
apparent
in
what
way
such
an
object
could
be
detrimental
to
her
daughter
nick
passed
on
and
quickly
paused
again
this
time
his
mother
discerned
before
the
marble
image
of
a
strange
grimacing
woman
presently
she
lost
sight
of
him
he
wandered
behind
things
looking
at
them
all
round
i
ought
to
get
plenty
of
ideas
for
my
modelling
ought
i
nick
his
sister
put
to
him
after
a
moment
ah
my
poor
child
what
shall
i
say
do
you
think
i
any
capacity
for
ideas
the
girl
continued
ruefully
lots
of
them
no
doubt
but
the
capacity
for
applying
them
for
putting
them
into
practice
how
much
of
that
have
you
how
can
i
tell
till
i
try
what
do
you
mean
by
trying
biddy
dear
why
you
know
you
seen
me
do
you
call
that
trying
her
brother
amusedly
demanded
ah
nick
she
said
with
sensibility
but
then
with
more
spirit
and
please
what
do
you
call
it
well
this
for
instance
is
a
good
case
and
her
companion
pointed
to
another
bust
a
head
of
a
young
man
in
at
which
they
had
just
arrived
a
modern
young
man
to
whom
with
his
thick
neck
his
little
cap
and
his
wide
ring
of
dense
curls
the
artist
had
given
the
air
of
some
sturdy
florentine
of
the
time
of
lorenzo
biddy
looked
at
the
image
a
moment
ah
that
not
trying
succeeding
not
altogether
it
only
trying
seriously
well
why
should
i
be
serious
mother
would
like
it
she
has
inherited
the
fine
old
superstition
that
art
pardonable
only
so
long
as
it
bad
so
long
as
it
done
at
odd
hours
for
a
little
distraction
like
a
game
of
tennis
or
of
whist
the
only
thing
that
can
justify
it
the
effort
to
carry
it
as
far
as
one
can
which
you
ca
do
without
time
and
singleness
of
purpose
she
regards
as
just
the
dangerous
the
criminal
element
it
the
oddest
view
the
drollest
immorality
she
does
want
one
to
be
professional
biddy
returned
as
if
she
could
do
justice
to
every
system
better
leave
it
alone
then
there
are
always
duffers
enough
i
do
want
to
be
a
duffer
biddy
said
but
i
thought
you
encouraged
me
so
i
did
my
poor
child
it
was
only
to
encourage
myself
with
your
own
work
your
painting
with
my
futile
my
endeavours
union
is
strength
so
that
we
might
present
a
wider
front
a
larger
surface
of
resistance
biddy
for
a
while
said
nothing
and
they
continued
their
tour
of
observation
she
noticed
how
he
passed
over
some
things
quickly
his
first
glance
sufficing
to
show
him
if
they
were
worth
another
and
then
recognised
in
a
moment
the
figures
that
made
some
appeal
his
tone
puzzled
but
his
certainty
of
eye
impressed
her
and
she
felt
what
a
difference
there
was
yet
between
them
how
much
longer
in
every
case
she
would
have
taken
to
discriminate
she
was
aware
of
how
little
she
could
judge
of
the
value
of
a
thing
till
she
had
looked
at
it
ten
minutes
indeed
modest
little
biddy
was
compelled
privately
to
add
and
often
not
even
then
she
was
mystified
as
i
say
nick
was
often
mystifying
it
was
his
only
fault
but
one
thing
was
definite
her
brother
had
high
ability
it
was
the
consciousness
of
this
that
made
her
bring
out
at
last
i
do
so
much
care
whether
or
no
i
please
mamma
if
i
please
you
oh
do
lean
on
me
i
a
wretched
broken
reed
i
no
use
he
promptly
admonished
her
do
you
mean
you
a
duffer
biddy
asked
in
alarm
frightful
frightful
so
that
you
intend
to
give
up
your
work
to
let
it
alone
as
you
advise
it
has
never
been
my
work
all
that
business
biddy
if
it
had
it
would
be
different
i
should
stick
to
it
and
you
stick
to
it
the
girl
said
standing
before
him
her
brother
looked
into
her
eyes
a
moment
and
she
had
a
compunction
she
feared
she
was
indiscreet
and
was
worrying
him
your
questions
are
much
simpler
than
the
elements
out
of
which
my
answer
should
come
a
great
talent
what
simpler
than
that
one
excellent
thing
dear
biddy
no
talent
at
all
well
yours
is
so
real
you
ca
help
it
we
shall
see
we
shall
see
said
nick
dormer
let
us
go
look
at
that
big
group
we
shall
see
if
your
talent
real
biddy
went
on
as
she
accompanied
him
no
we
shall
see
if
as
you
say
i
ca
help
it
what
nonsense
paris
makes
one
talk
the
young
man
added
as
they
stopped
in
front
of
the
composition
this
was
true
perhaps
but
not
in
a
sense
he
could
find
himself
tempted
to
deplore
the
present
was
far
from
his
first
visit
to
the
french
capital
he
had
often
quitted
england
and
usually
made
a
point
of
putting
in
as
he
called
it
a
few
days
there
on
the
outward
journey
to
the
continent
or
on
the
return
but
at
present
the
feelings
for
the
most
part
agreeable
attendant
upon
a
change
of
air
and
of
scene
had
been
more
punctual
and
more
acute
than
for
a
long
time
before
and
stronger
the
sense
of
novelty
refreshment
amusement
of
the
hundred
appeals
from
that
quarter
of
thought
to
which
on
the
whole
his
attention
was
apt
most
frequently
though
not
most
confessedly
to
stray
he
was
fonder
of
paris
than
most
of
his
countrymen
though
not
so
fond
perhaps
as
some
other
captivated
aliens
the
place
had
always
had
the
virtue
of
quickening
in
him
sensibly
the
life
of
reflexion
and
observation
it
was
a
good
while
since
his
impressions
had
been
so
favourable
to
the
city
by
the
seine
a
good
while
at
all
events
since
they
had
ministered
so
to
excitement
to
exhilaration
to
ambition
even
to
a
restlessness
that
was
not
prevented
from
being
agreeable
by
the
excess
of
agitation
in
it
nick
could
have
given
the
reason
of
this
unwonted
glow
but
his
preference
was
very
much
to
keep
it
to
himself
certainly
to
persons
not
deeply
knowing
or
at
any
rate
not
deeply
curious
in
relation
to
the
young
man
history
the
explanation
might
have
seemed
to
beg
the
question
consisting
as
it
did
of
the
simple
formula
that
he
had
at
last
come
to
a
crisis
why
a
crisis
what
was
it
and
why
had
he
not
come
to
it
before
the
reader
shall
learn
these
things
in
time
if
he
cares
enough
for
them
our
young
man
had
not
in
any
recent
year
failed
to
see
the
salon
which
the
general
voice
this
season
pronounced
not
particularly
good
none
the
less
it
was
the
present
exhibition
that
for
some
cause
connected
with
his
crisis
made
him
think
fast
produced
that
effect
he
had
spoken
of
to
his
mother
as
a
sense
of
artistic
life
the
precinct
of
the
marbles
and
bronzes
spoke
to
him
especially
the
glazed
garden
not
florally
rich
with
its
new
productions
alternating
with
perfunctory
plants
and
its
queer
damp
smell
partly
the
odour
of
plastic
clay
of
the
studios
of
sculptors
put
forth
the
voice
of
old
associations
of
other
visits
of
companionships
now
ended
an
insinuating
eloquence
which
was
at
the
same
time
somehow
identical
with
the
general
sharp
contagion
of
paris
there
was
youth
in
the
air
and
a
multitudinous
newness
for
ever
reviving
and
the
diffusion
of
a
hundred
talents
ingenuities
experiments
the
summer
clouds
made
shadows
on
the
roof
of
the
great
building
the
white
images
hard
in
their
crudity
spotted
the
place
with
provocations
the
rattle
of
plates
at
the
restaurant
sounded
sociable
in
the
distance
and
our
young
man
congratulated
himself
more
than
ever
that
he
had
not
missed
his
chance
he
felt
how
it
would
help
him
to
settle
something
at
the
moment
he
made
this
reflexion
his
eye
fell
upon
a
person
who
appeared
just
in
the
first
glimpse
to
carry
out
the
idea
of
help
he
uttered
a
lively
ejaculation
which
however
in
its
want
of
finish
biddy
failed
to
understand
so
pertinent
so
relevant
and
congruous
was
the
other
party
to
this
encounter
the
girl
attention
followed
her
brother
resting
with
it
on
a
young
man
who
faced
them
without
seeing
them
engaged
as
he
was
in
imparting
to
two
companions
his
ideas
about
one
of
the
works
exposed
to
view
what
biddy
remarked
was
that
this
young
man
was
fair
and
fat
and
of
the
middle
stature
he
had
a
round
face
and
a
short
beard
and
on
his
crown
a
mere
reminiscence
of
hair
as
the
fact
that
he
carried
his
hat
in
his
hand
permitted
to
be
observed
bridget
dormer
who
was
quick
placed
him
immediately
as
a
gentleman
but
as
a
gentleman
unlike
any
other
gentleman
she
had
ever
seen
she
would
have
taken
him
for
very
foreign
but
that
the
words
proceeding
from
his
mouth
reached
her
ear
and
imposed
themselves
as
a
rare
variety
of
english
it
was
not
that
a
foreigner
might
not
have
spoken
smoothly
enough
nor
yet
that
the
speech
of
this
young
man
was
not
smooth
it
had
in
truth
a
conspicuous
and
aggressive
perfection
and
biddy
was
sure
no
mere
learner
would
have
ventured
to
play
such
tricks
with
the
tongue
he
seemed
to
draw
rich
effects
and
wandering
airs
from
it
to
modulate
and
manipulate
it
as
he
would
have
done
a
musical
instrument
her
view
of
the
gentleman
companions
was
less
operative
save
for
her
soon
making
the
reflexion
that
they
were
people
whom
in
any
country
from
china
to
peru
you
would
immediately
have
taken
for
natives
one
of
them
was
an
old
lady
with
a
shawl
that
was
the
most
salient
way
in
which
she
presented
herself
the
shawl
was
an
ancient
fabric
of
embroidered
cashmere
such
as
many
ladies
wore
forty
years
ago
in
their
walks
abroad
and
such
as
no
lady
wears
it
had
fallen
half
off
the
back
of
the
wearer
but
at
the
moment
biddy
permitted
herself
to
consider
her
she
gave
it
a
violent
jerk
and
brought
it
up
to
her
shoulders
again
where
she
continued
to
arrange
and
settle
it
with
a
good
deal
of
jauntiness
and
elegance
while
she
listened
to
the
talk
of
the
gentleman
biddy
guessed
that
this
little
transaction
took
place
very
frequently
and
was
not
unaware
of
its
giving
the
old
lady
a
droll
factitious
faded
appearance
as
if
she
were
singularly
out
of
step
with
the
age
the
other
person
was
very
much
younger
she
might
have
been
a
daughter
and
had
a
pale
face
a
low
forehead
and
thick
dark
hair
what
she
chiefly
had
however
biddy
rapidly
discovered
was
a
pair
of
eyes
our
young
friend
was
helped
to
the
discovery
by
the
accident
of
their
resting
at
this
moment
for
a
time
it
struck
biddy
as
very
long
on
her
own
both
these
ladies
were
clad
in
light
thin
scant
gowns
giving
an
impression
of
flowered
figures
and
odd
transparencies
and
in
low
shoes
which
showed
a
great
deal
of
stocking
and
were
ornamented
with
large
rosettes
slightly
agitated
perception
travelled
directly
to
their
shoes
they
suggested
to
her
vaguely
that
the
wearers
were
dancers
connected
possibly
with
the
exhibition
of
the
by
the
time
she
had
taken
in
so
much
as
this
the
mellifluous
young
man
had
perceived
and
addressed
himself
to
her
brother
he
came
on
with
an
offered
hand
nick
greeted
him
and
said
it
was
a
happy
chance
he
was
uncommonly
glad
to
see
him
i
never
come
across
you
i
do
know
why
nick
added
while
the
two
smiling
looked
each
other
up
and
down
like
men
reunited
after
a
long
interval
oh
it
seems
to
me
there
reason
enough
our
paths
in
life
are
so
different
nick
friend
had
a
great
deal
of
manner
as
was
evinced
by
his
fashion
of
saluting
biddy
without
knowing
her
different
yes
but
not
so
different
as
that
do
we
both
live
in
london
after
all
and
in
the
nineteenth
century
ah
my
dear
dormer
excuse
me
i
do
live
in
the
nineteenth
century
de
la
the
gentleman
declared
nor
in
london
either
yes
when
i
not
at
samarcand
but
surely
we
diverged
since
the
old
days
i
adore
what
you
burn
you
burn
what
i
adore
while
the
stranger
spoke
he
looked
cheerfully
hospitably
at
biddy
not
because
it
was
she
she
easily
guessed
but
because
it
was
in
his
nature
to
desire
a
second
auditor
a
kind
of
sympathetic
gallery
her
life
was
somehow
filled
with
shy
people
and
she
immediately
knew
she
had
never
encountered
any
one
who
seemed
so
to
know
his
part
and
recognise
his
cues
how
do
you
know
what
i
adore
nicholas
dormer
asked
i
know
well
enough
what
you
used
to
that
more
than
i
do
myself
there
were
so
many
things
yes
there
are
many
things
many
many
that
what
makes
life
so
amusing
do
you
find
it
amusing
my
dear
fellow
à
se
do
you
think
so
ah
it
was
high
time
i
should
meet
you
i
see
i
an
idea
you
need
me
upon
my
word
i
think
i
do
nick
said
in
a
tone
which
struck
his
sister
and
made
her
wonder
still
more
why
if
the
gentleman
was
so
important
as
that
he
did
introduce
him
there
are
many
gods
and
this
is
one
of
their
temples
the
mysterious
personage
went
on
it
a
house
of
strange
idols
is
it
and
of
some
strange
and
unnatural
sacrifices
to
biddy
as
much
as
to
her
brother
this
remark
might
have
been
offered
but
the
girl
eyes
turned
back
to
the
ladies
who
for
the
moment
had
lost
their
companion
she
felt
irresponsive
and
feared
she
should
pass
with
this
easy
cosmopolite
for
a
stiff
scared
english
girl
which
was
not
the
type
she
aimed
at
but
was
even
ocular
commerce
overbold
so
long
as
she
had
a
sign
from
nick
the
elder
of
the
strange
women
had
turned
her
back
and
was
looking
at
some
bronze
figure
losing
her
shawl
again
as
she
did
so
but
the
other
stood
where
their
escort
had
quitted
her
giving
all
her
attention
to
his
sudden
sociability
with
others
her
arms
hung
at
her
sides
her
head
was
bent
her
face
lowered
so
that
she
had
an
odd
appearance
of
raising
her
eyes
from
under
her
brows
and
in
this
attitude
she
was
striking
though
her
air
was
so
unconciliatory
as
almost
to
seem
dangerous
did
it
express
resentment
at
having
been
abandoned
for
another
girl
biddy
who
began
to
be
frightened
there
was
a
moment
when
the
neglected
creature
resembled
a
tigress
about
to
spring
was
tempted
to
cry
out
that
she
had
no
wish
whatever
to
appropriate
the
gentleman
then
she
made
the
discovery
that
the
young
lady
too
had
a
manner
almost
as
much
as
her
clever
guide
and
the
rapid
induction
that
it
perhaps
meant
no
more
than
his
she
only
looked
at
biddy
from
beneath
her
eyebrows
which
were
wonderfully
arched
but
there
was
ever
so
much
of
a
manner
in
the
way
she
did
it
biddy
had
a
momentary
sense
of
being
a
figure
in
a
ballet
a
dramatic
ballet
a
subordinate
motionless
figure
to
be
dashed
at
to
music
or
strangely
capered
up
to
it
would
be
a
very
dramatic
ballet
indeed
if
this
young
person
were
the
heroine
she
had
magnificent
hair
the
girl
reflected
and
at
the
same
moment
heard
nick
say
to
his
interlocutor
you
not
in
london
one
ca
meet
you
there
i
rove
drift
float
was
the
answer
my
feelings
direct
me
if
such
a
life
as
mine
may
be
said
to
have
a
direction
where
there
anything
to
feel
i
try
to
be
there
the
young
man
continued
with
his
confiding
laugh
i
should
like
to
get
hold
of
you
nick
returned
well
in
that
case
there
would
be
no
doubt
the
intellectual
adventure
those
are
the
currents
any
sort
of
personal
relation
that
govern
my
career
i
do
want
to
lose
you
this
time
nick
continued
in
a
tone
that
excited
biddy
surprise
a
moment
before
when
his
friend
had
said
that
he
tried
to
be
where
there
was
anything
to
feel
she
had
wondered
how
he
could
endure
him
do
lose
me
do
lose
me
cried
the
stranger
after
a
fashion
which
affected
the
girl
as
the
highest
expression
of
irresponsibility
she
had
ever
seen
after
all
why
should
you
let
us
remain
together
unless
i
interfere
and
he
looked
smiling
and
interrogative
at
biddy
who
still
remained
blank
only
noting
again
that
nick
forbore
to
make
them
acquainted
this
was
an
anomaly
since
he
prized
the
gentleman
so
still
there
could
be
no
anomaly
of
nick
that
would
impose
itself
on
his
younger
sister
certainly
i
keep
you
he
said
unless
on
my
side
i
deprive
those
ladies
charming
women
but
it
not
an
indissoluble
union
we
meet
we
communicate
we
part
they
going
i
seeing
them
to
the
door
i
shall
come
back
with
this
nick
friend
rejoined
his
companions
who
moved
away
with
him
the
strange
fine
eyes
of
the
girl
lingering
on
biddy
brother
as
well
as
on
biddy
herself
as
they
receded
who
he
who
they
biddy
instantly
asked
he
a
gentleman
nick
made
answer
insufficiently
she
thought
and
even
with
a
shade
of
hesitation
he
spoke
as
if
she
might
have
supposed
he
was
not
one
and
if
he
was
really
one
why
did
he
introduce
him
but
biddy
would
for
the
world
have
put
this
question
and
he
now
moved
to
the
nearest
bench
and
dropped
upon
it
as
to
await
the
return
no
sooner
however
had
his
sister
seated
herself
than
he
said
see
here
my
dear
do
you
think
you
had
better
stay
do
you
want
me
to
go
back
to
mother
the
girl
asked
with
a
lengthening
visage
well
what
do
you
think
he
asked
it
indeed
gaily
enough
is
your
conversation
to
be
about
about
private
affairs
no
i
ca
say
that
but
i
doubt
if
mother
would
think
it
the
sort
of
thing
that
to
your
development
this
assertion
appeared
to
inspire
her
with
the
eagerness
with
which
she
again
broke
out
but
who
are
they
who
are
they
i
know
nothing
of
the
ladies
i
never
saw
them
before
the
man
a
fellow
i
knew
very
well
at
oxford
he
was
thought
immense
fun
there
we
diverged
as
he
says
and
i
had
almost
lost
sight
of
him
but
not
so
much
as
he
thinks
because
i
read
him
read
him
with
interest
he
has
written
a
very
clever
book
what
kind
of
a
book
a
sort
of
novel
what
sort
of
novel
well
i
do
know
with
a
lot
of
good
writing
biddy
listened
to
this
so
receptively
that
she
thought
it
perverse
her
brother
should
add
i
daresay
peter
will
have
come
if
you
return
to
mother
i
do
care
if
he
has
peter
nothing
to
me
but
i
go
if
you
wish
it
nick
smiled
upon
her
again
and
then
said
it
does
signify
we
all
go
all
she
echoed
he
wo
hurt
us
on
the
contrary
he
do
us
good
this
was
possible
the
girl
reflected
in
silence
but
none
the
less
the
idea
struck
her
as
courageous
of
their
taking
the
odd
young
man
back
to
breakfast
with
them
and
with
the
others
especially
if
peter
should
be
there
if
peter
was
nothing
to
her
it
was
singular
she
should
have
attached
such
importance
to
this
contingency
the
odd
young
man
reappeared
and
now
that
she
saw
him
without
his
queer
female
appendages
he
seemed
personally
less
weird
he
struck
her
moreover
as
generally
a
good
deal
accounted
for
by
the
literary
character
especially
if
it
were
responsible
for
a
lot
of
good
writing
as
he
took
his
place
on
the
bench
nick
said
to
him
indicating
her
my
sister
bridget
and
then
mentioned
his
name
gabriel
nash
you
enjoy
paris
you
happy
here
nash
inquired
leaning
over
his
friend
to
speak
to
the
girl
though
his
words
belonged
to
the
situation
it
struck
her
that
his
tone
did
and
this
made
her
answer
him
more
dryly
than
she
usually
spoke
oh
yes
it
very
nice
and
french
art
interests
you
you
find
things
here
that
please
oh
yes
i
like
some
of
them
nash
considered
her
kindly
i
hoped
you
say
you
like
the
academy
better
she
would
if
she
did
think
you
expected
it
said
nicholas
dormer
oh
nick
biddy
protested
miss
dormer
herself
an
english
picture
their
visitor
pronounced
in
the
tone
of
a
man
whose
urbanity
was
a
general
solvent
that
a
compliment
if
you
do
like
them
biddy
exclaimed
ah
some
of
them
some
of
them
there
a
certain
sort
of
thing
nash
continued
we
must
feel
everything
everything
that
we
can
here
for
that
you
do
like
english
art
then
nick
demanded
with
a
slight
accent
of
surprise
nash
indulged
his
wonder
my
dear
dormer
do
you
remember
the
old
complaint
i
used
to
make
of
you
you
had
formulas
that
were
like
walking
in
one
hat
one
may
see
something
in
a
case
and
one
may
not
upon
my
word
said
nick
i
do
know
any
one
who
was
fonder
of
a
generalisation
than
you
you
turned
them
off
as
the
man
at
the
distributes
they
were
my
wild
oats
i
sown
them
all
we
shall
see
that
oh
there
nothing
of
them
now
a
tame
scanty
homely
growth
my
only
good
generalisations
are
my
actions
we
shall
see
then
ah
pardon
me
you
ca
see
them
with
the
naked
eye
moreover
mine
are
principally
negative
people
actions
i
know
are
for
the
most
part
the
things
they
do
but
mine
are
all
the
things
i
do
there
are
so
many
of
those
so
many
but
they
do
produce
any
effect
and
then
all
the
rest
are
shades
extremely
fine
shades
shades
of
behaviour
nick
inquired
with
an
interest
which
surprised
his
sister
nash
discourse
striking
her
mainly
as
the
twaddle
of
the
shades
of
impression
of
appreciation
said
the
young
man
with
his
explanatory
smile
all
my
behaviour
consists
of
my
feelings
well
do
you
show
your
feelings
you
used
to
was
it
mainly
those
of
disgust
nash
asked
those
operate
no
longer
i
closed
that
window
do
you
mean
you
like
everything
dear
me
no
but
i
look
only
at
what
i
do
like
do
you
mean
that
you
lost
the
noble
faculty
of
disgust
i
have
the
least
idea
i
never
try
it
my
dear
fellow
said
gabriel
nash
we
only
one
life
that
we
know
anything
about
fancy
taking
it
up
with
disagreeable
impressions
when
then
shall
we
go
in
for
the
agreeable
what
do
you
mean
by
the
agreeable
nick
demanded
oh
the
happy
moments
of
our
consciousness
the
multiplication
of
those
moments
we
must
save
as
many
as
possible
from
the
dark
gulf
nick
had
excited
surprise
on
the
part
of
his
sister
but
it
was
now
biddy
turn
to
make
him
open
his
eyes
a
little
she
raised
her
sweet
voice
in
appeal
to
the
stranger
do
you
think
there
are
any
wrongs
in
the
world
any
abuses
and
sufferings
oh
so
many
so
many
that
why
one
must
choose
choose
to
stop
them
to
reform
them
is
that
the
choice
biddy
asked
that
nick
she
added
blushing
and
looking
at
this
personage
ah
our
divergence
yes
nash
sighed
there
are
all
kinds
of
machinery
for
that
very
complicated
and
ingenious
your
formulas
my
dear
dormer
your
formulas
hang
i
have
got
any
nick
now
bravely
declared
to
me
personally
the
simplest
ways
are
those
that
appeal
most
nash
went
on
we
pay
too
much
attention
to
the
ugly
we
notice
it
we
magnify
it
the
great
thing
is
to
leave
it
alone
and
encourage
the
beautiful
you
must
be
very
sure
you
get
hold
of
the
beautiful
said
nick
ah
precisely
and
that
just
the
importance
of
the
faculty
of
appreciation
we
must
train
our
special
sense
it
capable
of
extraordinary
extension
life
none
too
long
for
that
but
what
the
good
of
the
extraordinary
extension
if
there
is
no
affirmation
of
it
if
it
all
goes
to
the
negative
as
you
say
where
are
the
fine
consequences
dormer
asked
in
one
own
spirit
one
is
one
self
a
fine
consequence
that
the
most
important
one
we
have
to
do
with
am
a
fine
consequence
said
gabriel
nash
biddy
rose
from
the
bench
at
this
and
stepped
away
a
little
as
to
look
at
a
piece
of
statuary
but
she
had
not
gone
far
before
pausing
and
turning
she
bent
her
eyes
on
the
speaker
with
a
heightened
colour
an
air
of
desperation
and
the
question
after
a
moment
are
you
then
an
æsthete
ah
there
one
of
the
formulas
that
walking
in
one
hat
i
profession
my
dear
young
lady
i
no
these
things
are
a
part
of
the
complicated
ingenious
machinery
as
i
say
i
keep
to
the
simplest
way
i
find
that
gives
one
enough
to
do
merely
to
be
is
such
a
to
live
such
an
art
to
feel
such
a
career
bridget
dormer
turned
her
back
and
examined
her
statue
and
her
brother
said
to
his
old
friend
and
to
write
to
write
oh
i
shall
never
do
it
again
you
done
it
almost
well
enough
to
be
inconsistent
that
book
of
yours
is
anything
but
negative
it
complicated
and
ingenious
my
dear
fellow
i
extremely
ashamed
of
that
book
said
gabriel
nash
ah
call
yourself
a
bloated
buddhist
and
have
done
with
it
his
companion
exclaimed
have
done
with
it
i
have
the
least
desire
to
have
done
with
it
and
why
should
one
call
one
self
anything
one
only
deprives
other
people
of
their
dearest
occupation
let
me
add
that
you
do
to
have
an
insight
into
the
art
of
life
till
it
ceases
to
be
of
the
smallest
consequence
to
you
what
you
may
be
called
that
rudimentary
but
if
you
go
in
for
shades
you
must
also
go
in
for
names
you
must
distinguish
nick
objected
the
observer
nothing
without
his
categories
his
types
and
varieties
ah
trust
him
to
distinguish
said
gabriel
nash
sweetly
that
for
his
own
convenience
he
has
privately
a
terminology
to
meet
it
one
style
but
from
the
moment
it
for
the
convenience
of
others
the
signs
have
to
be
grosser
the
shades
begin
to
go
that
a
deplorable
hour
literature
you
see
is
for
the
convenience
of
others
it
requires
the
most
abject
concessions
it
plays
such
mischief
with
one
style
that
really
i
had
to
give
it
up
and
politics
nick
asked
well
what
about
them
was
nash
reply
with
a
special
cadence
as
he
watched
his
friend
sister
who
was
still
examining
her
statue
biddy
was
divided
between
irritation
and
curiosity
she
had
interposed
space
but
she
had
not
gone
beyond
nick
question
made
her
curiosity
throb
as
a
rejoinder
to
his
friend
words
that
no
doubt
you
say
is
still
far
more
for
the
convenience
of
others
is
still
worse
for
one
style
biddy
turned
round
in
time
to
hear
nash
answer
it
has
simply
nothing
in
life
to
do
with
shades
i
ca
say
worse
for
it
than
that
biddy
stepped
nearer
at
this
and
drew
still
further
on
her
courage
wo
mamma
be
waiting
ought
we
to
go
to
luncheon
both
the
young
men
looked
up
at
her
and
nash
broke
out
you
ought
to
protest
you
ought
to
save
him
to
save
him
biddy
echoed
he
had
a
style
upon
my
word
he
had
but
i
seen
it
go
i
read
his
speeches
you
were
capable
of
that
nick
laughed
for
you
yes
but
it
was
like
listening
to
a
nightingale
in
a
brass
band
i
think
they
were
beautiful
biddy
declared
her
brother
got
up
at
this
tribute
and
nash
rising
too
said
with
his
bright
colloquial
air
but
miss
dormer
he
had
eyes
he
was
made
to
see
to
see
all
over
to
see
everything
there
are
so
few
like
that
i
think
he
still
sees
biddy
returned
wondering
a
little
why
nick
did
defend
himself
he
sees
his
his
dreadful
dear
young
lady
poor
man
fancy
your
having
a
you
you
and
spending
your
days
and
your
nights
looking
at
it
i
as
soon
pass
my
life
looking
at
an
advertisement
on
a
hoarding
you
do
see
me
some
day
a
great
statesman
said
nick
my
dear
fellow
it
exactly
what
i
a
terror
of
mercy
do
you
admire
them
biddy
cried
it
a
trade
like
another
and
a
method
of
making
one
way
which
society
certainly
condones
but
when
one
can
be
something
better
why
what
in
the
world
is
better
biddy
asked
the
young
man
gasped
and
nick
replying
for
him
said
gabriel
nash
is
better
you
must
come
and
lunch
with
us
i
must
keep
you
i
must
he
added
we
shall
save
him
yet
nash
kept
on
easily
to
biddy
while
they
went
and
the
girl
wondered
still
more
what
her
mother
would
make
of
him
iii
after
her
companions
left
her
lady
agnes
rested
for
five
minutes
in
silence
with
her
elder
daughter
at
the
end
of
which
time
she
observed
i
suppose
one
must
have
food
at
any
rate
and
getting
up
quitted
the
place
where
they
had
been
sitting
and
where
are
we
to
go
i
hate
eating
out
of
doors
she
went
on
dear
me
when
one
comes
to
paris
grace
returned
in
a
tone
apparently
implying
that
in
so
rash
an
adventure
one
must
be
prepared
for
compromises
and
concessions
the
two
ladies
wandered
to
where
they
saw
a
large
sign
of
buffet
suspended
in
the
air
entering
a
precinct
reserved
for
little
tables
chairs
and
waiters
one
of
these
functionaries
approached
them
with
eagerness
and
with
a
mesdames
sont
seules
receiving
in
return
from
her
ladyship
the
slightly
snappish
announcement
non
nous
sommes
beaucoup
he
introduced
them
to
a
table
larger
than
most
of
the
others
and
under
his
protection
they
took
their
places
at
it
and
began
rather
languidly
and
vaguely
to
consider
the
question
of
the
repast
the
waiter
had
placed
a
in
lady
agnes
hands
and
she
studied
it
through
her
with
a
failure
of
interest
while
he
enumerated
with
professional
fluency
the
resources
of
the
establishment
and
grace
watched
the
people
at
the
other
tables
she
was
hungry
and
had
already
broken
a
morsel
from
a
long
glazed
roll
not
cold
beef
and
pickles
you
know
she
observed
to
her
mother
lady
agnes
gave
no
heed
to
this
profane
remark
but
dropped
her
and
laid
down
the
greasy
document
what
does
it
signify
i
daresay
it
all
nasty
grace
continued
and
she
added
inconsequently
if
peter
comes
he
sure
to
be
particular
let
him
first
be
particular
to
come
her
ladyship
exclaimed
turning
a
cold
eye
upon
the
waiter
poulet
chasseur
filets
mignons
sauce
bearnaise
the
man
suggested
you
give
us
what
i
tell
you
said
lady
agnes
and
she
mentioned
with
distinctness
and
authority
the
dishes
of
which
she
desired
that
the
meal
should
be
composed
he
interjected
three
or
four
more
suggestions
but
as
they
produced
absolutely
no
impression
on
her
he
became
silent
and
submissive
doing
justice
apparently
to
her
ideas
for
lady
agnes
had
ideas
and
though
it
had
suited
her
humour
ten
minutes
before
to
profess
herself
helpless
in
such
a
case
the
manner
in
which
she
imposed
them
on
the
waiter
as
original
practical
and
economical
showed
the
high
executive
woman
the
mother
of
children
the
daughter
of
earls
the
consort
of
an
official
the
dispenser
of
hospitality
looking
back
upon
a
lifetime
of
luncheons
she
carried
many
cares
and
the
feeding
of
multitudes
she
was
honourably
conscious
of
having
fed
them
decently
as
she
had
always
done
everything
had
ever
been
one
of
them
absurdly
dear
she
remarked
to
her
daughter
as
the
waiter
went
away
to
this
remark
grace
made
no
answer
she
had
been
used
for
a
long
time
back
to
hearing
that
everything
was
very
dear
it
was
what
one
always
expected
so
she
found
the
case
herself
but
she
was
silent
and
inventive
about
it
and
nothing
further
passed
in
the
way
of
conversation
with
her
mother
while
they
waited
for
the
latter
orders
to
be
executed
till
lady
agnes
reflected
audibly
he
makes
me
unhappy
the
way
he
talks
about
julia
sometimes
i
think
he
does
it
to
torment
one
one
ca
mention
her
grace
responded
it
better
not
to
mention
her
but
to
leave
it
alone
yet
he
never
mentions
her
of
himself
in
some
cases
that
supposed
to
show
that
people
like
people
though
of
course
something
more
required
to
prove
it
lady
agnes
continued
to
meditate
sometimes
i
think
he
thinking
of
her
then
at
others
i
ca
fancy
he
thinking
of
it
would
be
awfully
suitable
said
grace
biting
her
roll
her
companion
had
a
pause
as
if
looking
for
some
higher
ground
to
put
it
upon
then
she
appeared
to
find
this
loftier
level
in
the
observation
of
course
he
must
like
her
he
has
known
her
always
nothing
can
be
plainer
than
that
she
likes
him
grace
opined
poor
julia
lady
agnes
almost
wailed
and
her
tone
suggested
that
she
knew
more
about
that
than
she
was
ready
to
state
it
is
as
if
she
was
clever
and
well
read
her
daughter
went
on
if
there
were
nothing
else
there
would
be
a
reason
in
her
being
so
interested
in
politics
in
everything
that
he
is
ah
what
nick
is
that
what
i
sometimes
wonder
grace
eyed
her
parent
in
some
despair
why
mother
is
he
going
to
be
like
papa
she
waited
for
an
answer
that
did
come
after
which
she
pursued
i
thought
you
thought
him
so
like
him
already
well
i
do
said
lady
agnes
quietly
who
is
then
certainly
percy
is
lady
agnes
was
silent
a
space
there
no
one
like
your
father
dear
papa
grace
handsomely
concurred
then
with
a
rapid
transition
it
would
be
so
jolly
for
all
of
us
she
be
so
nice
to
us
she
that
already
in
her
way
said
lady
agnes
conscientiously
having
followed
the
return
quick
as
it
was
much
good
does
it
do
her
and
she
reproduced
the
note
of
her
bitterness
of
a
moment
before
it
does
her
some
good
that
one
should
look
out
for
her
i
do
and
i
think
she
knows
it
grace
declared
one
can
at
any
rate
keep
other
women
off
do
meddle
you
very
clumsy
was
her
mother
not
particularly
sympathetic
rejoinder
there
are
other
women
who
are
beautiful
and
there
are
others
who
are
clever
and
rich
yes
but
not
all
in
one
that
what
so
nice
in
julia
her
fortune
would
be
thrown
in
he
would
appear
to
have
married
her
for
it
if
he
does
he
wo
said
lady
agnes
a
trifle
obscurely
yes
that
what
so
charming
and
he
could
do
anything
then
he
well
your
father
had
no
fortune
to
speak
of
yes
but
did
uncle
percy
help
him
his
wife
helped
him
said
lady
agnes
dear
mamma
the
girl
was
prompt
there
one
thing
she
added
that
carteret
will
always
help
nick
what
do
you
mean
by
why
whether
he
marries
julia
or
not
things
are
so
easy
lady
agnes
judged
it
will
all
depend
on
nick
behaviour
he
can
stop
it
grace
dormer
stared
she
evidently
thought
carteret
beneficence
a
part
of
the
scheme
of
nature
how
could
he
stop
it
by
not
being
serious
it
is
so
hard
to
prevent
people
giving
you
money
serious
grace
repeated
does
he
want
him
to
be
a
prig
like
lord
egbert
yes
that
exactly
what
he
wants
and
what
he
do
for
him
he
do
for
him
only
if
he
marries
julia
has
he
told
you
grace
inquired
and
then
before
her
mother
could
answer
i
delighted
at
that
she
cried
he
has
told
me
but
that
the
way
things
happen
lady
agnes
was
less
optimistic
than
her
daughter
and
such
optimism
as
she
cultivated
was
a
thin
tissue
with
the
sense
of
things
as
they
are
showing
through
if
nick
becomes
rich
charles
carteret
will
make
him
more
so
if
he
does
he
wo
give
him
a
shilling
oh
mamma
grace
demurred
it
all
very
well
to
say
that
in
public
life
money
is
as
necessary
as
it
used
to
be
her
ladyship
went
on
broodingly
those
who
say
so
do
know
anything
about
it
it
always
intensely
necessary
her
daughter
visibly
affected
by
the
gloom
of
her
manner
felt
impelled
to
evoke
as
a
corrective
a
more
cheerful
idea
i
daresay
but
the
fact
is
there
that
poor
papa
had
so
little
yes
and
there
the
fact
that
it
killed
him
these
words
came
out
with
a
strange
quick
little
flare
of
passion
they
startled
grace
dormer
who
jumped
in
her
place
and
gasped
oh
mother
the
next
instant
however
she
added
in
a
different
voice
oh
peter
for
with
an
air
of
eagerness
a
gentleman
was
walking
up
to
them
how
d
do
cousin
agnes
how
d
do
little
grace
peter
sherringham
laughed
and
shook
hands
with
them
and
three
minutes
later
was
settled
in
his
chair
at
their
table
on
which
the
first
elements
of
the
meal
had
been
placed
explanations
on
one
side
and
the
other
were
demanded
and
produced
from
which
it
appeared
that
the
two
parties
had
been
in
some
degree
at
the
day
before
lady
agnes
and
her
companions
travelled
to
paris
sherringham
had
gone
to
london
for
hours
on
private
business
of
the
ambassador
arriving
on
his
return
by
the
only
early
that
morning
there
had
accordingly
been
a
delay
in
his
receiving
nick
dormer
two
notes
if
nick
had
come
to
the
embassy
in
person
he
might
have
done
him
the
honour
to
call
he
would
have
learned
that
the
second
secretary
was
absent
lady
agnes
was
not
altogether
successful
in
assigning
a
motive
to
her
son
neglect
of
this
courteous
form
she
could
but
say
i
expected
him
i
wanted
him
to
go
and
indeed
not
hearing
from
you
he
would
have
gone
immediately
an
hour
or
two
hence
on
leaving
this
place
but
we
here
so
quietly
not
to
go
out
not
to
seem
to
appeal
to
the
ambassador
nick
put
it
so
mother
we
keep
out
of
it
a
friendly
note
will
do
i
do
know
definitely
what
he
wanted
to
keep
out
of
unless
anything
like
gaiety
the
embassy
is
gay
i
know
but
i
sure
his
note
was
friendly
was
it
i
daresay
you
see
for
yourself
he
different
directly
he
gets
abroad
he
does
seem
to
care
lady
agnes
paused
a
moment
not
carrying
out
this
particular
elucidation
then
she
resumed
he
said
you
have
seen
julia
and
that
you
understand
everything
from
her
and
when
i
asked
how
she
know
he
said
she
knows
everything
he
never
said
a
word
to
me
about
julia
peter
sherringham
returned
lady
agnes
and
her
daughter
exchanged
a
glance
at
this
the
latter
had
already
asked
three
times
where
julia
was
and
her
ladyship
dropped
that
they
had
been
hoping
she
would
be
able
to
come
with
peter
the
young
man
set
forth
that
she
was
at
the
moment
at
an
hotel
in
the
rue
de
la
paix
but
had
only
been
there
since
that
morning
he
had
seen
her
before
proceeding
to
the
champs
elysées
she
had
come
up
to
paris
by
an
early
train
she
had
been
staying
at
versailles
of
all
places
in
the
world
she
had
been
a
week
in
paris
on
her
return
from
cannes
her
stay
there
had
been
of
nearly
a
month
fancy
and
then
had
gone
out
to
versailles
to
see
billinghurst
perhaps
they
remember
her
poor
sister
she
was
staying
there
to
teach
her
daughters
french
she
had
a
dozen
or
two
and
julia
had
spent
three
days
with
her
she
was
to
return
to
england
about
the
it
would
make
seven
weeks
she
must
have
been
away
from
town
a
rare
thing
for
her
she
usually
stuck
to
it
so
in
summer
three
days
with
billinghurst
how
very
of
her
lady
agnes
commented
oh
they
very
nice
to
her
sherringham
said
well
i
hope
so
grace
dormer
exhaled
why
did
you
make
her
come
here
i
proposed
it
but
she
would
another
at
this
passed
between
the
two
ladies
and
peter
went
on
she
said
you
must
come
and
see
her
at
the
hôtel
de
hollande
of
course
we
do
that
lady
agnes
declared
nick
went
to
ask
about
her
at
the
westminster
she
gave
that
up
they
would
give
her
the
rooms
she
wanted
her
usual
set
she
delightfully
particular
grace
said
complacently
then
she
added
she
like
pictures
does
she
peter
sherringham
stared
oh
i
daresay
but
that
not
what
she
has
in
her
head
this
morning
she
has
some
news
from
london
she
immensely
excited
what
has
she
in
her
head
lady
agnes
asked
what
her
news
from
london
grace
added
she
wants
nick
to
stand
nick
to
stand
both
ladies
cried
she
undertakes
to
bring
him
in
for
harsh
mr
pinks
is
dead
the
fellow
you
know
who
got
the
seat
at
the
general
election
he
dropped
down
in
london
disease
of
the
heart
or
something
of
that
sort
julia
has
her
telegram
but
i
see
it
was
in
last
night
papers
imagine
nick
never
mentioned
it
said
lady
agnes
do
you
know
mother
abroad
he
only
reads
foreign
papers
oh
i
know
i
no
patience
with
him
her
ladyship
continued
dear
julia
it
a
nasty
little
place
and
pinks
had
a
tight
squeeze
or
something
of
that
sort
but
if
it
returned
a
liberal
a
year
ago
very
likely
it
will
do
so
again
julia
at
any
rate
believes
it
can
be
made
to
if
the
man
nick
and
is
ready
to
take
the
order
to
put
him
in
i
sure
if
she
can
do
it
she
will
grace
pronounced
dear
dear
julia
and
nick
can
do
something
for
himself
said
the
mother
of
this
candidate
i
no
doubt
he
can
do
anything
peter
sherringham
returned
then
do
you
mean
in
expenses
he
inquired
ah
i
afraid
he
ca
do
much
in
expenses
poor
dear
boy
and
dreadful
how
little
we
can
look
to
percy
well
i
daresay
you
may
look
to
julia
i
think
that
her
idea
delightful
julia
lady
agnes
broke
out
if
poor
sir
nicholas
could
have
known
of
course
he
must
go
straight
home
she
added
he
wo
like
that
said
grace
then
he
have
to
go
without
liking
it
it
will
rather
spoil
little
excursion
if
you
only
just
come
peter
suggested
to
say
nothing
of
the
great
biddy
if
enjoying
paris
we
may
stay
perhaps
with
julia
to
protect
us
said
lady
agnes
ah
she
wo
stay
she
go
over
for
her
man
her
man
the
fellow
who
stands
whoever
he
is
especially
if
he
nick
these
last
words
caused
the
eyes
of
peter
sherringham
companions
to
meet
again
and
he
went
on
she
go
straight
down
to
harsh
wonderful
julia
lady
agnes
panted
of
course
nick
must
go
straight
there
too
well
i
suppose
he
must
see
first
if
they
have
him
if
they
have
him
why
how
can
he
tell
till
he
tries
i
mean
the
people
at
headquarters
the
fellows
who
arrange
it
lady
agnes
coloured
a
little
my
dear
peter
do
you
suppose
there
will
be
the
least
doubt
of
their
the
son
of
his
father
of
course
it
a
great
name
cousin
agnes
a
very
great
name
one
of
the
greatest
simply
lady
agnes
smiled
it
the
best
name
in
the
world
said
grace
more
emphatically
all
the
same
it
did
prevent
his
losing
his
seat
by
votes
it
was
too
odious
her
ladyship
cried
i
remember
i
remember
and
in
such
a
case
as
that
why
did
they
immediately
put
him
in
somewhere
else
how
one
sees
you
live
abroad
dear
peter
there
happens
to
have
been
the
most
extraordinary
lack
of
openings
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
for
a
year
they
had
their
hand
on
him
keeping
him
all
ready
i
daresay
they
telegraphed
him
and
he
has
told
you
lady
agnes
faltered
he
so
very
odd
when
he
abroad
at
home
too
he
lets
things
go
grace
interposed
he
does
so
little
takes
no
trouble
her
mother
suffered
this
statement
to
pass
unchallenged
and
she
pursued
philosophically
i
suppose
it
because
he
knows
he
so
clever
so
he
is
dear
old
man
but
what
does
he
do
what
has
he
been
doing
in
a
positive
way
he
has
been
painting
ah
not
seriously
lady
agnes
protested
that
the
worst
way
said
peter
sherringham
good
things
neither
of
the
ladies
made
a
direct
response
to
this
but
lady
agnes
said
he
has
spoken
repeatedly
they
always
calling
on
him
he
speaks
magnificently
grace
attested
that
another
of
the
things
i
lose
living
in
far
countries
and
doing
the
salon
now
with
the
great
biddy
just
the
things
in
this
part
i
ca
think
what
keeps
them
so
long
lady
agnes
groaned
did
you
ever
see
such
a
dreadful
place
sherringham
stared
are
the
things
good
i
had
an
idea
good
cried
lady
agnes
they
too
odious
too
wicked
ah
laughed
peter
that
what
people
fall
into
if
they
live
abroad
the
french
ought
to
live
abroad
here
they
come
grace
announced
at
this
point
but
they
got
a
strange
man
with
them
that
a
bore
when
we
want
to
talk
lady
agnes
sighed
peter
got
up
in
the
spirit
of
welcome
and
stood
a
moment
watching
the
others
approach
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
talking
to
judge
by
the
gentleman
he
dropped
and
while
he
remains
so
conspicuous
our
eyes
may
briefly
rest
on
him
he
was
middling
high
and
was
visibly
a
representative
of
the
nervous
rather
than
of
the
phlegmatic
branch
of
his
race
he
had
an
oval
face
fine
firm
features
and
a
complexion
that
tended
to
the
brown
brown
were
his
eyes
and
women
thought
them
soft
dark
brown
his
hair
in
which
the
same
critics
sometimes
regretted
the
absence
of
a
little
undulation
it
was
perhaps
to
conceal
this
plainness
that
he
wore
it
very
short
his
teeth
were
white
his
moustache
was
pointed
and
so
was
the
small
beard
that
adorned
the
extremity
of
his
chin
his
face
expressed
intelligence
and
was
very
much
alive
it
had
the
further
distinction
that
it
often
struck
superficial
observers
with
a
certain
foreignness
of
cast
the
deeper
sort
however
usually
felt
it
latently
english
enough
there
was
an
idea
that
having
taken
up
the
diplomatic
career
and
gone
to
live
in
strange
lands
he
cultivated
the
mask
of
an
alien
an
italian
or
a
spaniard
of
an
alien
in
time
even
one
of
the
wonderful
ubiquitous
diplomatic
agents
of
the
sixteenth
century
in
fact
none
the
less
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
be
more
modern
than
peter
sherringham
more
of
one
class
and
country
but
this
did
prevent
several
stray
persons
bridget
dormer
for
instance
from
admiring
the
hue
of
his
cheek
for
its
olive
richness
and
his
moustache
and
beard
for
their
resemblance
to
those
of
charles
i
at
the
same
time
she
rather
jumbled
her
comparisons
she
thought
he
recalled
a
titian
iv
peter
meeting
with
nick
was
of
the
friendliest
on
both
sides
involving
a
great
many
dear
fellows
and
old
boys
and
his
salutation
to
the
younger
of
the
miss
dormers
consisted
of
the
frankest
delighted
to
see
you
my
dear
bid
there
was
no
kissing
but
there
was
cousinship
in
the
air
of
a
conscious
living
kind
as
gabriel
nash
doubtless
quickly
noted
hovering
for
a
moment
outside
the
group
biddy
said
nothing
to
peter
sherringham
but
there
was
no
flatness
in
a
silence
which
heaved
as
it
were
with
the
fairest
physiognomic
portents
nick
introduced
gabriel
nash
to
his
mother
and
to
the
other
two
as
a
delightful
old
friend
whom
he
had
just
come
across
and
sherringham
acknowledged
the
act
by
saying
to
nash
but
as
if
rather
less
for
his
sake
than
for
that
of
the
presenter
i
seen
you
very
often
before
ah
repetition
recurrence
we
have
yet
in
the
study
of
how
to
live
abolished
that
clumsiness
have
we
nash
genially
inquired
it
a
poverty
in
the
supernumeraries
of
our
stage
that
we
do
pass
once
for
all
but
come
round
and
cross
again
like
a
procession
or
an
army
at
the
theatre
it
a
sordid
economy
that
ought
to
have
been
managed
better
the
right
thing
would
be
just
appearance
and
the
procession
regardless
of
expense
for
ever
and
for
ever
different
the
company
was
occupied
in
placing
itself
at
table
so
that
the
only
disengaged
attention
for
the
moment
was
grace
to
whom
as
her
eyes
rested
on
him
the
young
man
addressed
these
last
words
with
a
smile
alas
a
very
shabby
idea
is
it
the
world
is
got
up
regardless
of
expense
grace
looked
quickly
away
from
him
and
said
to
her
brother
nick
mr
pinks
is
dead
mr
pinks
asked
gabriel
nash
appearing
to
wonder
where
he
should
sit
the
member
for
harsh
and
julia
wants
you
to
stand
the
girl
went
on
mr
pinks
the
member
for
harsh
what
names
to
be
sure
gabriel
mused
cheerfully
still
unseated
julia
wants
me
i
much
obliged
to
her
nick
absently
said
nash
please
sit
by
my
mother
with
peter
on
her
other
side
my
dear
it
is
julia
lady
agnes
spoke
earnestly
every
one
wants
you
have
you
heard
from
your
people
did
you
know
the
seat
was
vacant
nick
was
looking
round
the
table
to
see
what
was
on
it
upon
my
word
i
do
remember
what
else
have
you
ordered
mother
there
some
my
dear
and
afterwards
some
galantine
here
a
dish
of
eggs
with
i
advise
you
to
go
in
for
it
nick
said
peter
sherringham
to
whom
the
preparation
in
question
was
presented
into
the
eggs
with
vous
my
dear
fellow
how
can
i
stand
how
can
i
sit
where
the
money
to
come
from
the
money
why
from
jul
grace
began
but
immediately
caught
her
mother
eye
poor
julia
how
you
do
work
her
nick
exclaimed
nash
i
recommend
you
the
mother
he
my
best
friend
do
look
after
him
i
an
impression
i
breakfasted
i
not
sure
nash
smiled
with
those
beautiful
ladies
try
again
you
find
out
the
money
can
be
managed
the
expenses
are
very
small
and
the
certain
lady
agnes
pursued
not
apparently
heeding
her
injunction
in
respect
to
nash
rather
if
julia
goes
down
her
elder
daughter
exclaimed
perhaps
julia
wo
go
down
nick
answered
humorously
biddy
was
seated
next
to
nash
so
that
she
could
take
occasion
to
ask
who
are
the
beautiful
ladies
as
if
she
failed
to
recognise
her
brother
allusion
in
reality
this
was
an
innocent
trick
she
was
more
curious
than
she
could
have
given
a
suitable
reason
for
about
the
odd
women
from
whom
her
neighbour
had
lately
separated
deluded
misguided
infatuated
persons

replied
understanding
that
she
had
asked
for
a
description
strange
eccentric
almost
romantic
types
predestined
victims
sacrificial
lambs
this
was
copious
yet
it
was
vague
so
that
biddy
could
only
respond
oh
all
that
but
meanwhile
peter
sherringham
said
to
nick
here
you
know
you
must
go
and
see
her
nick
looked
at
him
an
instant
rather
hard
as
if
to
say
you
too
but
peter
eyes
appeared
to
answer
no
no
not
i
upon
which
his
cousin
rejoined
of
course
i
go
and
see
her
i
go
immediately
please
to
thank
her
for
thinking
of
me
thinking
of
you
there
are
plenty
to
think
of
you
lady
agnes
said
there
are
sure
to
be
telegrams
at
home
we
must
go
back
we
must
go
back
we
must
go
back
to
england
nick
dormer
asked
and
as
his
mother
made
no
answer
he
continued
do
you
mean
i
must
go
to
harsh
her
ladyship
evaded
this
question
inquiring
of
nash
if
he
would
have
a
morsel
of
fish
but
her
gain
was
small
for
this
gentleman
struck
again
by
the
unhappy
name
of
the
bereaved
constituency
only
broke
out
ah
what
a
place
to
represent
how
can
you
how
can
you
it
an
excellent
place
said
lady
agnes
coldly
i
imagine
never
been
there
it
a
very
good
place
indeed
it
belongs
very
largely
to
my
cousin
mrs
dallow
gabriel
partook
of
the
fish
listening
with
interest
but
i
thought
we
had
no
more
it
pockets
we
rather
lack
so
many
of
us
there
are
plenty
of
harshes
nick
dormer
observed
i
do
know
what
you
mean
lady
agnes
said
to
nash
with
considerable
majesty
peter
sherringham
also
addressed
him
with
an
oh
it
all
right
they
come
down
on
you
like
a
shot
and
the
young
man
continued
ingenuously
do
you
mean
to
say
you
to
pay
money
to
get
into
that
awful
place
that
it
not
who
are
paid
into
that
awful
place
lady
agnes
repeated
blankly
into
the
house
of
commons
that
you
do
get
a
high
salary
my
dear
nash
you
delightful
do
leave
me
do
leave
me
nick
cried
while
his
mother
looked
at
him
with
an
eye
that
demanded
who
in
the
world
this
extraordinary
person
what
then
did
you
think
were
peter
sherringham
asked
nash
facial
radiance
rested
on
him
why
boroughs
that
filled
your
pocket
to
do
that
sort
of
thing
without
a
bribe
trop
fort
he
lives
at
samarcand
nick
dormer
explained
to
his
mother
who
flushed
perceptibly
what
do
you
advise
me
i
do
whatever
you
say
he
went
on
to
his
old
acquaintance
my
dear
my
dear
lady
agnes
pleaded
see
julia
first
with
all
respect
to
nash
she
of
excellent
counsel
said
peter
sherringham
nash
smiled
across
the
table
at
his
host
the
lady
first
the
lady
first
i
not
a
word
to
suggest
as
against
any
idea
of
hers
we
must
sit
here
too
long
there
be
so
much
to
do
said
lady
agnes
anxiously
perceiving
a
certain
slowness
in
the
service
of
the
biddy
had
been
up
to
this
moment
mainly
occupied
in
looking
covertly
and
in
snatches
at
peter
sherringham
as
was
perfectly
lawful
in
a
young
lady
with
a
handsome
cousin
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
more
than
a
year
but
her
sweet
voice
now
took
license
to
throw
in
the
words
we
know
what
nash
thinks
of
politics
he
told
us
just
now
he
thinks
them
dreadful
no
not
dreadful
only
inferior
the
personage
impugned
protested
everything
relative
inferior
to
what
lady
agnes
demanded
nash
appeared
to
consider
a
moment
to
anything
else
that
may
be
in
question
nothing
else
is
in
question
said
her
ladyship
in
a
tone
that
would
have
been
triumphant
if
it
had
not
been
so
dry
ah
then
and
her
neighbour
shook
his
head
sadly
he
turned
after
this
to
biddy
the
ladies
whom
i
was
with
just
now
and
in
whom
you
were
so
good
as
to
express
an
interest
biddy
gave
a
sign
of
assent
and
he
went
on
they
persons
theatrical
the
younger
one
trying
to
go
upon
the
stage
and
are
you
assisting
her
biddy
inquired
pleased
she
had
guessed
so
nearly
right
not
in
the
least
i
rather
choking
her
off
i
consider
it
the
lowest
of
the
arts
lower
than
politics
asked
peter
sherringham
who
was
listening
to
this
dear
no
i
wo
say
that
i
think
the
théâtre
français
a
greater
institution
than
the
house
of
commons
i
agree
with
you
there
laughed
sherringham
all
the
more
that
i
do
consider
the
dramatic
art
a
low
one
it
seems
to
me
on
the
contrary
to
include
all
the
others
yes
that
a
view
i
think
it
the
view
of
my
friends
of
your
friends
two
ladies
old
acquaintances
whom
i
met
in
paris
a
week
ago
and
whom
i
just
been
spending
an
hour
with
in
this
place
you
should
have
seen
them
they
struck
me
very
much
biddy
said
to
her
cousin
i
should
like
to
see
them
if
they
really
have
anything
to
say
to
the
theatre
it
can
easily
be
managed
do
you
believe
in
the
theatre
asked
gabriel
nash
passionately
sherringham
confessed
do
you
before
nash
had
had
time
to
answer
biddy
had
interposed
with
a
sigh
how
i
wish
i
could
go
but
in
paris
i
ca
i
take
you
biddy
i
vow
i
take
you
but
the
plays
peter
the
girl
objected
mamma
says
they
worse
than
the
pictures
oh
we
arrange
that
they
shall
do
one
at
the
français
on
purpose
for
a
delightful
little
yearning
english
girl
can
you
make
them
i
can
make
them
do
anything
i
choose
ah
then
it
the
theatre
that
believes
in
said
nash
it
would
be
ungrateful
if
it
did
after
all
i
done
for
it
sherringham
gaily
opined
lady
agnes
had
withdrawn
herself
from
between
him
and
her
other
guest
and
to
signify
that
she
at
least
had
finished
eating
had
gone
to
sit
by
her
son
whom
she
held
with
some
importunity
in
conversation
but
hearing
the
theatre
talked
of
she
threw
across
an
impersonal
challenge
to
the
paradoxical
young
man
pray
should
you
think
it
better
for
a
gentleman
to
be
an
actor
better
than
being
a
politician
ah
comedian
for
comedian
is
the
actor
more
honest
lady
agnes
turned
to
her
son
and
brought
forth
with
spirit
think
of
your
great
father
nicholas
he
was
an
honest
man
said
nicholas
that
perhaps
why
he
stand
it
peter
sherringham
judged
the
colloquy
to
have
taken
an
uncomfortable
twist
though
not
wholly
as
it
seemed
to
him
by
the
act
of
queer
comrade
to
draw
it
back
to
safer
ground
he
said
to
this
personage
may
i
ask
if
the
ladies
you
just
spoke
of
are
english
and
miss
rooth
is
that
the
rather
odd
name
the
very
same
only
the
daughter
according
to
her
kind
desires
to
be
known
by
some
de
before
she
has
even
been
able
to
enlist
and
what
does
she
call
herself
bridget
dormer
asked
maud
vavasour
or
edith
temple
or
gladys
vane
some
rubbish
of
that
sort
what
then
is
her
own
name
miriam
miriam
rooth
it
would
do
very
well
and
would
give
her
the
benefit
of
the
prepossessing
fact
that
to
the
best
of
my
belief
at
least
she
more
than
half
a
jewess
it
is
as
good
as
rachel
felix
sherringham
said
the
name
as
good
but
not
the
talent
the
girl
splendidly
stupid
and
more
than
half
a
jewess
do
you
believe
it
sherringham
laughed
do
believe
she
a
jewess
biddy
asked
still
more
interested
in
miriam
rooth
no
no
that
she
stupid
really
if
she
is
she
be
the
first
ah
you
may
judge
for
yourself
nash
rejoined
if
you
come
afternoon
to
madame
carré
rue
de
constantinople
madame
carré
why
i
already
a
note
from
her
i
found
it
this
morning
on
my
return
to
paris
asking
me
to
look
in
at
five
and
listen
to
a
that
my
arrangement
i
obtained
the
favour
the
ladies
want
an
opinion
and
dear
old
carré
has
consented
to
see
them
and
to
give
one
maud
vavasour
will
recite
and
the
venerable
artist
will
pass
judgement
sherringham
remembered
he
had
his
note
in
his
pocket
and
took
it
out
to
look
it
over
she
wishes
to
make
her
a
little
audience
she
says
do
better
with
that
and
she
asks
me
because
i
english
i
shall
make
a
point
of
going
and
bring
dormer
if
you
can
the
audience
will
be
better
will
you
come
dormer
nash
continued
appealing
to
his
friend
will
you
come
with
me
to
hear
an
english
amateur
recite
and
an
old
french
actress
pitch
into
her
nick
looked
round
from
his
talk
with
his
mother
and
grace
i
go
anywhere
with
you
so
that
as
i
told
you
i
may
lose
sight
of
you
may
keep
hold
of
you
poor
nash
why
is
he
so
useful
lady
agnes
took
a
cold
freedom
to
inquire
he
steadies
me
mother
oh
i
wish
you
take
peter
biddy
broke
out
wistfully
to
her
cousin
to
spend
an
hour
with
an
old
french
actress
do
want
to
go
upon
the
stage
the
young
man
asked
no
but
i
want
to
see
something
to
know
something
madame
carré
wonderful
in
her
way
but
she
hardly
company
for
a
little
english
girl
i
not
little
i
only
too
big
and
goes
the
person
you
speak
of
for
a
professional
purpose
and
with
her
good
mother
smiled
nash
i
think
lady
agnes
would
hardly
venture
oh
i
seen
her
good
mother
said
biddy
as
if
she
had
her
impression
of
what
the
worth
of
that
protection
might
be
yes
but
you
have
heard
her
it
then
that
you
measure
her
biddy
was
wistful
still
is
it
the
famous
honorine
carré
the
great
celebrity
honorine
in
person
the
incomparable
the
perfect
said
peter
sherringham
the
first
artist
of
our
time
taking
her
altogether
she
and
i
are
old
pals
she
has
been
so
good
as
to
come
and
things
which
she
does
sometimes
still
le
as
no
one
else
in
my
rooms
make
her
come
then
we
can
go
one
of
these
days
and
the
young
lady
miriam
maud
gladys
make
her
come
too
sherringham
looked
at
nash
and
the
latter
was
bland
oh
you
have
no
difficulty
she
jump
at
it
very
good
i
give
a
little
artistic
tea
with
julia
too
of
course
and
you
must
come
mr
nash
this
gentleman
promised
with
an
inclination
and
peter
continued
but
if
as
you
say
you
not
for
helping
the
young
lady
how
came
you
to
arrange
this
interview
with
the
great
model
precisely
to
stop
her
short
the
great
model
will
find
her
very
bad
her
judgements
as
you
probably
know
are
rhadamanthine
unfortunate
creature
said
biddy
i
think
you
cruel
never
mind
i
look
after
them
sherringham
laughed
and
how
can
madame
carré
judge
if
the
girl
recites
english
she
so
intelligent
that
she
could
judge
if
she
recited
chinese
peter
declared
that
true
but
the
recites
also
in
french
said
gabriel
nash
then
she
is
stupid
and
in
italian
and
in
several
more
tongues
for
aught
i
know
sherringham
was
visibly
interested
very
good
we
put
her
through
them
all
she
must
be
clever
biddy
went
on
yearningly
she
has
spent
her
life
on
the
continent
she
has
wandered
about
with
her
mother
she
has
picked
up
things
and
is
she
a
lady
biddy
asked
oh
tremendous
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
on
the
mother
side
on
the
father
on
the
other
hand
i
imagine
only
a
jew
stockbroker
in
the
city
then
they
rich
or
ought
to
be
sherringham
suggested
ought
to
be
ah
there
the
bitterness
the
stockbroker
had
too
short
a
go
he
was
carried
off
in
his
flower
however
he
left
his
wife
a
certain
property
which
she
appears
to
have
muddled
away
not
having
the
safeguard
of
being
herself
a
hebrew
this
is
what
she
has
lived
on
till
this
and
another
resource
her
husband
as
she
has
often
told
me
had
the
artistic
temperament
that
common
as
you
know
among
he
made
the
most
of
his
little
opportunities
and
collected
various
pictures
tapestries
enamels
porcelains
and
similar
gewgaws
he
parted
with
them
also
i
gather
at
a
profit
in
short
he
carried
on
a
neat
little
business
as
a
it
was
nipped
in
the
bud
but
rooth
was
left
with
a
certain
number
of
these
articles
in
her
hands
indeed
they
must
have
formed
her
only
capital
she
was
not
a
woman
of
business
she
turned
them
no
doubt
to
indifferent
account
but
she
sold
them
piece
by
piece
and
they
kept
her
going
while
her
daughter
grew
up
it
was
to
this
precarious
traffic
conducted
with
extraordinary
mystery
and
delicacy
that
five
years
ago
in
florence
i
was
indebted
for
my
acquaintance
with
her
in
those
days
i
used
to
collect
heaven
help
me
i
used
to
pick
up
rubbish
which
i
could
ill
afford
it
was
a
little
phase
we
have
our
little
phases
have
we
nash
asked
with
childlike
trust
and
i
come
out
on
the
other
side
rooth
had
an
old
green
pot
and
i
heard
of
her
old
green
pot
to
hear
of
it
was
to
long
for
it
so
that
i
went
to
see
it
under
cover
of
night
i
bought
it
and
a
couple
of
years
ago
i
overturned
and
smashed
it
it
was
the
last
of
the
little
phase
it
was
not
however
as
seen
the
last
of
rooth
i
met
her
afterwards
in
london
and
i
found
her
a
year
or
two
ago
in
venice
she
appears
to
be
a
great
wanderer
she
had
other
old
pots
of
other
colours
red
yellow
black
or
blue
she
could
produce
them
of
any
complexion
you
liked
i
know
whether
she
carried
them
about
with
her
or
whether
she
had
little
secret
stores
in
the
principal
cities
of
europe
at
any
rate
they
seem
all
gone
on
the
other
hand
she
has
her
daughter
who
has
grown
up
and
who
a
precious
vase
of
another
kind
less
fragile
i
hope
than
the
rest
may
she
not
be
overturned
and
smashed
peter
sherringham
and
biddy
dormer
listened
with
attention
to
this
history
and
the
girl
testified
to
the
interest
with
which
she
had
followed
it
by
saying
when
nash
had
ceased
speaking
a
jewish
stockbroker
a
dealer
in
curiosities
what
an
odd
person
to
marry
for
a
person
who
was
well
born
i
daresay
he
was
a
german
his
name
must
have
been
simply
roth
and
the
poor
lady
to
smarten
it
up
has
put
in
another
sherringham
ingeniously
suggested
you
both
very
clever
said
gabriel
and
rudolf
roth
as
i
happen
to
know
was
indeed
the
designation
of
maud
vavasour
papa
but
so
far
as
the
question
of
derogation
goes
one
might
as
well
drown
as
starve
for
what
connexion
is
a
misalliance
when
one
happens
to
have
the
unaccommodating
the
crushing
honour
of
being
a
of
castle
nugent
that
the
high
lineage
of
maud
mamma
i
seem
to
have
heard
it
mentioned
that
rudolf
roth
was
very
versatile
and
like
most
of
his
species
not
unacquainted
with
the
practice
of
music
he
had
been
employed
to
teach
the
harmonium
to
miss
and
she
had
profited
by
his
lessons
if
his
daughter
like
him
and
she
not
like
her
mother
he
was
darkly
and
dangerously
handsome
so
i
venture
rapidly
to
reconstruct
the
situation
a
silence
for
the
moment
had
fallen
on
lady
agnes
and
her
other
two
children
so
that
nash
with
his
universal
urbanity
practically
addressed
these
last
remarks
to
them
as
well
as
to
his
other
auditors
lady
agnes
looked
as
if
she
wondered
whom
he
was
talking
about
and
having
caught
the
name
of
a
noble
residence
she
inquired
castle
nugent
where
in
the
world
that
it
a
domain
of
immeasurable
extent
and
almost
inconceivable
splendour
but
i
fear
not
to
be
found
in
any
prosaic
earthly
geography
lady
agnes
rested
her
eyes
on
the
tablecloth
as
if
she
were
sure
a
liberty
had
not
been
taken
with
her
or
at
least
with
her
order
and
while
nash
continued
to
abound
in
descriptive
suppositions
it
must
be
on
the
banks
of
the
manzanares
or
the
guadalquivir
peter
sherringham
whose
imagination
had
seemingly
been
kindled
by
the
sketch
of
miriam
rooth
took
up
the
argument
and
reminded
him
that
he
had
a
short
time
before
assigned
a
low
place
to
the
dramatic
art
and
had
not
yet
answered
the
question
as
to
whether
he
believed
in
the
theatre
which
gave
the
speaker
a
further
chance
i
do
know
that
i
understand
your
question
there
are
different
ways
of
taking
it
do
i
think
important
is
that
what
you
mean
important
certainly
to
managers
and
who
want
to
make
money
to
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
want
to
produce
themselves
in
public
by
limelight
and
to
other
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
are
bored
and
stupid
and
do
know
what
to
do
with
their
evening
it
a
commercial
and
social
convenience
which
may
be
infinitely
worked
but
important
artistically
intellectually
how
it
be
so
poor
so
limited
a
form
upon
my
honour
it
strikes
me
as
rich
and
various
do
think
it
a
poor
and
limited
form
nick
sherringham
added
appealing
to
his
kinsman
i
think
whatever
nash
thinks
i
no
opinion
but
his
this
answer
of
the
hope
of
the
dormers
drew
the
eyes
of
his
mother
and
sisters
to
him
and
caused
his
friend
to
exclaim
that
he
was
used
to
such
responsibilities
so
few
people
had
ever
tested
his
presence
of
mind
by
agreeing
with
him
oh
i
used
to
be
of
your
way
of
feeling
nash
went
on
to
sherringham
i
understand
you
perfectly
it
a
phase
like
another
i
been
through
it
été
comme
and
you
went
then
very
often
to
the
théâtre
français
and
it
was
there
i
saw
you
i
place
you
now
i
afraid
i
noticed
none
of
the
other
spectators
nash
explained
i
had
no
attention
but
for
the
great
carré
she
was
still
on
the
stage
judge
of
my
infatuation
and
how
i
can
allow
for
yours
when
i
tell
you
that
i
sought
her
acquaintance
that
i
could
rest
till
i
had
told
her
how
i
hung
upon
her
lips
that
just
what
told
her
sherringham
returned
she
was
very
kind
to
me
she
said
me
rendez
des
that
just
what
she
said
to
me
and
we
remained
very
good
friends
so
have
we
laughed
sherringham
and
such
perfect
art
as
hers
do
you
mean
to
say
you
do
consider
important
such
a
rare
dramatic
intelligence
i
afraid
you
read
the
you
catch
their
phrases
nash
spoke
with
pity
dramatic
intelligence
is
never
rare
nothing
more
common
then
why
have
we
so
many
shocking
actors
have
we
i
thought
they
were
mostly
good
succeeding
more
easily
and
more
completely
in
that
business
than
in
anything
else
what
could
they
do
those
people
generally
if
they
did
do
that
poor
thing
and
reflect
that
the
poor
thing
enables
them
to
succeed
of
course
always
there
are
numbers
of
people
on
the
stage
who
are
no
actors
at
all
for
it
even
easier
to
our
poor
humanity
to
be
ineffectively
stupid
and
vulgar
than
to
bring
down
the
house
it
not
easy
by
what
i
can
see
to
produce
completely
any
artistic
effect
sherringham
declared
and
those
the
actor
produces
are
among
the
most
momentous
we
know
you
not
persuade
me
that
to
watch
such
an
actress
as
madame
carré
was
an
education
of
the
taste
an
enlargement
of
one
knowledge
she
did
what
she
could
poor
woman
but
in
what
belittling
coarsening
conditions
she
had
to
interpret
a
character
in
a
play
and
a
character
in
a
play
not
to
say
the
whole
piece
i
speak
more
particularly
of
modern
pieces
is
such
a
wretchedly
small
peg
to
hang
anything
on
the
dramatist
shows
us
so
little
is
so
hampered
by
his
audience
is
restricted
to
so
poor
an
analysis
i
know
the
complaint
it
all
the
fashion
now
the
despise
the
theatre
said
peter
sherringham
in
the
manner
of
a
man
abreast
with
the
culture
of
his
age
and
not
to
be
captured
by
a
surprise
it
will
be
known
better
yet
wo
it
when
the
essentially
brutal
nature
of
the
modern
audience
is
still
more
perceived
when
it
has
been
properly
analysed
the
of
the
population
of
a
big
commercial
city
at
the
hour
of
the
day
when
their
taste
is
at
its
lowest
flocking
out
of
hideous
hotels
and
restaurants
gorged
with
food
stultified
with
buying
and
selling
and
with
all
the
other
sordid
preoccupations
of
the
age
squeezed
together
in
a
sweltering
mass
disappointed
in
their
seats
timing
the
author
timing
the
actor
wishing
to
get
their
money
back
on
the
spot
all
before
eleven
fancy
putting
the
exquisite
before
such
a
tribunal
as
that
there
not
even
a
question
of
it
the
dramatist
would
if
he
could
and
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
he
could
if
he
would
he
has
to
make
the
basest
concessions
one
of
his
principal
canons
is
that
he
must
enable
his
spectators
to
catch
the
suburban
trains
which
stop
at
what
would
you
think
of
any
other
artist
the
painter
or
the
novelist
whose
governing
forces
should
be
the
dinner
and
the
suburban
trains
the
old
dramatists
did
defer
to
them
not
so
much
at
least
and
that
why
they
less
and
less
actable
if
they
touched
the
large
loose
men
it
only
to
be
mutilated
and
trivialised
besides
they
had
a
simpler
civilisation
to
represent
societies
in
which
the
life
of
man
was
in
action
in
passion
in
immediate
and
violent
expression
those
things
could
be
put
upon
the
playhouse
boards
with
comparatively
little
sacrifice
of
their
completeness
and
their
truth
we
so
infinitely
more
reflective
and
complicated
and
diffuse
that
it
makes
all
the
difference
what
can
you
do
with
a
character
with
an
idea
with
a
feeling
between
dinner
and
the
suburban
trains
you
can
give
a
gross
rough
sketch
of
them
but
how
little
you
touch
them
how
bald
you
leave
them
what
crudity
compared
with
what
the
novelist
does
do
you
write
novels
mr
nash
peter
candidly
asked
no
but
i
read
them
when
they
extraordinarily
good
and
i
do
go
to
plays
i
read
balzac
for
instance
i
encounter
the
admirable
portrait
of
valérie
marneffe
in
cousine
and
you
contrast
it
with
the
poverty
of
emile
augier
séraphine
in
lionnes
i
was
awaiting
you
there
that
the
de
of
you
fellows
what
an
extraordinary
discussion
what
dreadful
authors
lady
agnes
murmured
to
her
son
but
he
was
listening
so
attentively
to
the
other
young
men
that
he
made
no
response
and
peter
sherringham
went
on
i
seen
madame
carré
in
things
of
the
modern
repertory
which
she
has
made
as
vivid
to
me
caused
to
abide
as
ineffaceably
in
my
memory
as
valérie
marneffe
she
the
balzac
as
one
may
say
of
actresses
the
miniaturist
as
it
were
of
whitewashers
nash
offered
as
a
substitute
it
might
have
been
guessed
that
sherringham
resented
his
damned
freedom
yet
could
but
emulate
his
easy
form
you
be
magnanimous
if
you
thought
the
young
lady
you
introduced
to
our
old
friend
would
be
important
nash
lightly
weighed
it
she
might
be
much
more
so
than
she
ever
will
be
lady
agnes
however
got
up
to
terminate
the
scene
and
even
to
signify
that
enough
had
been
said
about
people
and
questions
she
had
never
so
much
as
heard
of
every
one
else
rose
the
waiter
brought
nicholas
the
receipt
of
the
bill
and
sherringham
went
on
to
his
interlocutor
perhaps
she
be
more
so
than
you
think
perhaps
if
you
take
an
interest
in
her
a
mystic
voice
seems
to
exhort
me
to
do
so
to
whisper
that
though
never
seen
her
i
shall
find
something
in
her
on
which
peter
appealed
what
do
you
say
biddy
shall
i
take
an
interest
in
her
the
girl
faltered
coloured
a
little
felt
a
certain
embarrassment
in
being
publicly
treated
as
an
oracle
if
she
not
nice
i
do
advise
it
and
if
she
nice
you
advise
it
still
less
her
brother
exclaimed
laughing
and
putting
his
arm
round
her
lady
agnes
looked
sombre
she
might
have
been
saying
to
herself
heaven
help
us
what
chance
has
a
girl
of
mine
with
a
man
who
so
agog
about
actresses
she
was
disconcerted
and
distressed
a
multitude
of
incongruous
things
all
the
morning
had
been
forced
upon
her
attention
displeasing
pictures
and
still
more
displeasing
theories
about
them
vague
portents
of
perversity
on
nick
part
and
a
strange
eagerness
on
peter
learned
apparently
in
paris
to
discuss
with
a
person
who
had
a
tone
she
never
had
been
exposed
to
topics
irrelevant
and
uninteresting
almost
disgusting
the
practical
effect
of
which
was
to
make
light
of
her
presence
let
us
leave
this
let
us
leave
this
she
grimly
said
the
party
moved
together
toward
the
door
of
departure
and
her
ruffled
spirit
was
not
soothed
by
hearing
her
son
remark
to
his
terrible
friend
you
know
you
do
escape
me
i
stick
to
you
at
this
lady
agnes
broke
out
and
interposed
pardon
my
reminding
you
that
you
going
to
call
on
julia
well
ca
nash
also
come
to
call
on
julia
that
just
what
i
want
that
she
should
see
him
peter
sherringham
came
humanely
to
his
kinswoman
assistance
a
better
way
perhaps
will
be
for
them
to
meet
under
my
auspices
at
my
tea
this
will
enable
me
to
return
one
favour
for
another
if
nash
is
so
good
as
to
introduce
me
to
this
aspirant
for
honours
we
estimate
so
differently
i
introduce
him
to
my
sister
a
much
more
positive
quantity
it
easy
to
see
who
have
the
best
of
it
grace
dormer
declared
while
nash
stood
there
serenely
impartially
in
a
graceful
detached
way
which
seemed
characteristic
of
him
assenting
to
any
decision
that
relieved
him
of
the
grossness
of
choice
and
generally
confident
that
things
would
turn
out
well
for
him
he
was
cheerfully
helpless
and
sociably
indifferent
ready
to
preside
with
a
smile
even
at
a
discussion
of
his
own
admissibility
nick
will
bring
you
i
a
little
corner
at
the
embassy
sherringham
continued
you
very
kind
you
must
bring
then
rue
de
constantinople
at
five
do
be
afraid
oh
dear
biddy
wailed
as
they
went
on
again
and
lady
agnes
seizing
his
arm
marched
off
more
quickly
with
her
son
when
they
came
out
into
the
champs
elysées
nick
dormer
looking
round
saw
his
friend
had
disappeared
biddy
had
attached
herself
to
peter
and
grace
have
encouraged
nash
v
lady
agnes
idea
had
been
that
her
son
should
go
straight
from
the
palais
de
to
the
hôtel
de
hollande
with
or
without
his
mother
and
his
sisters
as
his
humour
should
seem
to
recommend
much
as
she
desired
to
see
their
valued
julia
and
as
she
knew
her
daughters
desired
it
she
was
quite
ready
to
put
off
their
visit
if
this
sacrifice
should
contribute
to
a
speedy
confrontation
for
nick
she
was
anxious
he
should
talk
with
dallow
and
anxious
he
should
be
anxious
himself
but
it
presently
appeared
that
he
was
conscious
of
no
pressure
of
eagerness
his
view
was
that
she
and
the
girls
should
go
to
their
cousin
without
delay
and
should
if
they
liked
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
in
her
society
he
would
go
later
he
would
go
in
the
evening
there
were
lots
of
things
he
wanted
to
do
meanwhile
this
question
was
discussed
with
some
intensity
though
not
at
length
while
the
little
party
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
place
de
la
concorde
to
which
they
had
proceeded
on
foot
and
lady
agnes
noticed
that
the
lots
of
things
to
which
he
proposed
to
give
precedence
over
an
urgent
duty
a
conference
with
a
person
who
held
out
full
hands
to
him
were
implied
somehow
in
the
friendly
glance
with
which
he
covered
the
great
square
the
opposite
bank
of
the
seine
the
steep
blue
roofs
of
the
quay
the
bright
immensity
of
paris
what
in
the
world
could
be
more
important
than
making
sure
of
his
seat
so
quickly
did
the
good
imagination
travel
and
now
that
idea
appealed
to
him
less
than
a
ramble
in
search
of
old
books
and
prints
since
she
was
sure
this
was
what
he
had
in
his
head
julia
would
be
flattered
should
she
know
it
but
of
course
she
must
know
it
lady
agnes
was
already
thinking
of
the
least
injurious
account
she
could
give
of
the
young
man
want
of
precipitation
she
would
have
liked
to
represent
him
as
tremendously
occupied
in
his
room
at
their
own
hotel
in
getting
off
political
letters
to
every
one
it
should
concern
and
particularly
in
drawing
up
his
address
to
the
electors
of
harsh
fortunately
she
was
a
woman
of
innumerable
discretions
and
a
part
of
the
worn
look
that
sat
in
her
face
came
from
her
having
schooled
herself
for
years
in
commerce
with
her
husband
and
her
sons
not
to
insist
unduly
she
would
have
liked
to
insist
nature
had
formed
her
to
insist
and
the
had
told
in
more
ways
than
one
even
now
it
was
powerless
to
prevent
her
suggesting
that
before
doing
anything
else
nick
should
at
least
repair
to
the
inn
and
see
if
there
were
some
telegrams
he
freely
consented
to
do
as
much
as
this
and
having
called
a
cab
that
she
might
go
her
way
with
the
girls
kissed
her
again
as
he
had
done
at
the
exhibition
this
was
an
attention
that
could
never
displease
her
but
somehow
when
he
kissed
her
she
was
really
the
more
worried
she
had
come
to
recognise
it
as
a
sign
that
he
was
slipping
away
from
her
and
she
wished
she
might
frankly
take
it
as
his
clutch
at
her
to
save
him
she
drove
off
with
a
vague
sense
that
at
any
rate
she
and
the
girls
might
do
something
toward
keeping
the
place
warm
for
him
she
had
been
a
little
vexed
that
peter
had
not
administered
more
of
a
push
toward
the
hôtel
de
hollande
clear
as
it
had
become
to
her
now
that
there
was
a
foreignness
in
peter
which
was
not
to
be
counted
on
and
which
made
him
speak
of
english
affairs
and
even
of
english
domestic
politics
as
local
and
even
funny
they
were
very
grandly
local
and
if
one
recalled
in
public
life
an
occasional
droll
incident
was
that
liberally
viewed
just
the
warm
human
comfort
of
them
as
she
left
the
two
young
men
standing
together
in
the
middle
of
the
place
de
la
concorde
the
grand
composition
of
which
nick
as
she
looked
back
appeared
to
have
paused
to
admire
as
if
he
had
seen
it
a
thousand
times
she
wished
she
might
have
thought
of
peter
influence
with
her
son
as
exerted
a
little
more
in
favour
of
localism
she
had
a
fear
he
would
abbreviate
the
boy
however
he
had
been
very
nice
he
had
invited
them
all
to
dine
with
him
that
evening
at
a
convenient
café
promising
to
bring
julia
and
one
of
his
colleagues
so
much
as
this
he
had
been
willing
to
do
to
make
sure
nick
and
his
sister
should
meet
his
want
of
localism
moreover
was
not
so
great
as
that
if
it
should
turn
out
that
there
anything
beneath
his
manner
toward
biddy
the
upshot
of
this
reflexion
might
have
been
represented
by
the
circumstance
of
her
ladyship
remarking
after
a
minute
to
her
younger
daughter
who
sat
opposite
her
in
the
de
that
it
would
do
no
harm
if
she
should
get
a
new
hat
and
that
the
search
might
be
instituted
that
afternoon
a
french
hat
mamma
said
grace
oh
do
wait
till
she
gets
home
i
think
they
really
prettier
here
you
know
biddy
opined
and
lady
agnes
said
simply
i
daresay
they
cheaper
what
was
in
her
mind
in
fact
was
i
daresay
peter
thinks
them
becoming
it
will
be
seen
she
had
plenty
of
inward
occupation
the
sum
of
which
was
not
lessened
by
her
learning
when
she
reached
the
top
of
the
rue
de
la
paix
that
dallow
had
gone
out
half
an
hour
before
and
had
left
no
message
she
was
more
disconcerted
by
this
incident
than
she
could
have
explained
or
than
she
thought
was
right
as
she
had
taken
for
granted
julia
would
be
in
a
manner
waiting
for
them
how
could
she
be
sure
nick
was
coming
when
people
were
in
paris
a
few
days
they
did
mope
in
the
house
but
she
might
have
waited
a
little
longer
or
have
left
an
explanation
was
she
then
not
so
much
in
earnest
about
nick
standing
did
she
recognise
the
importance
of
being
there
to
see
him
about
it
lady
agnes
wondered
if
her
behaviour
were
a
sign
of
her
being
already
tired
of
the
way
this
young
gentleman
treated
her
perhaps
she
had
gone
out
because
an
instinct
told
her
that
the
great
propriety
of
their
meeting
early
would
make
no
difference
with
him
told
her
he
would
after
all
come
his
mother
heart
sank
as
she
glanced
at
this
possibility
that
their
precious
friend
was
already
tired
she
having
on
her
side
an
intuition
that
there
were
still
harder
things
in
store
she
had
disliked
having
to
tell
dallow
that
nick
would
see
her
till
the
evening
but
now
she
disliked
still
more
her
not
being
there
to
hear
it
she
even
resented
a
little
her
kinswoman
not
having
reasoned
that
she
and
the
girls
would
come
in
any
event
and
not
thought
them
worth
staying
in
for
it
came
up
indeed
that
she
would
perhaps
have
gone
to
their
hotel
which
was
a
good
way
up
the
rue
de
rivoli
near
the
palais
royal
on
which
the
cabman
was
directed
to
drive
to
that
establishment
as
he
jogged
along
she
took
in
some
degree
the
measure
of
what
that
might
mean
julia
seeking
a
little
to
avoid
them
was
she
growing
to
dislike
them
did
she
think
they
kept
too
sharp
an
eye
on
her
so
that
the
idea
of
their
standing
in
a
still
closer
relation
would
be
enticing
her
conduct
up
to
this
time
had
not
worn
such
an
appearance
unless
perhaps
a
little
just
a
very
little
in
the
matter
of
her
ways
with
poor
grace
lady
agnes
knew
she
was
particularly
fond
of
poor
grace
and
could
even
sufficiently
guess
the
reason
the
manner
in
which
grace
betrayed
most
how
they
wanted
to
make
sure
of
her
she
remembered
how
long
the
girl
had
stayed
the
last
time
she
had
been
at
harsh
going
for
an
acceptable
week
and
dragging
out
her
visit
to
a
month
she
took
a
private
heroic
vow
that
grace
should
go
near
the
place
again
for
a
year
not
that
is
unless
nick
and
julia
were
married
within
the
time
if
that
were
to
happen
she
should
care
she
recognised
that
it
absolutely
everything
julia
should
be
in
love
with
nick
it
was
also
better
she
should
dislike
his
mother
and
sisters
after
a
probable
pursuit
of
him
than
before
lady
agnes
did
justice
to
the
natural
rule
in
virtue
of
which
it
usually
comes
to
pass
that
a
woman
does
get
on
with
her
husband
female
belongings
and
was
even
willing
to
be
sacrificed
to
it
in
her
disciplined
degree
but
she
desired
not
to
be
sacrificed
for
nothing
if
she
was
to
be
objected
to
as
a
she
wished
to
be
the
first
at
the
hotel
in
the
rue
de
rivoli
she
had
the
disappointment
of
finding
that
dallow
had
not
called
and
also
that
no
telegrams
had
come
she
went
in
with
the
girls
for
half
an
hour
and
then
straggled
out
with
them
again
she
was
undetermined
and
dissatisfied
and
the
afternoon
was
rather
a
problem
of
the
kind
moreover
that
she
disliked
most
and
was
least
accustomed
to
not
a
choice
between
different
things
to
do
her
life
had
been
full
of
that
but
a
want
of
anything
to
do
at
all
nick
had
said
to
her
before
they
separated
you
can
knock
about
with
the
girls
you
know
everything
amusing
here
that
was
easily
said
while
he
sauntered
and
gossiped
with
peter
sherringham
and
perhaps
went
to
see
more
pictures
like
those
in
the
salon
he
was
usually
on
such
occasions
very
about
spending
his
time
with
them
but
this
episode
had
taken
altogether
a
perverse
profane
form
she
had
no
desire
whatever
to
knock
about
and
was
far
from
finding
everything
in
paris
amusing
she
had
no
aptitude
for
aimlessness
and
moreover
thought
it
vulgar
if
she
had
found
julia
card
at
the
hotel
the
sign
of
a
hope
of
catching
them
just
as
they
came
back
from
the
salon
she
would
have
made
a
second
attempt
to
see
her
before
the
evening
but
now
certainly
they
would
leave
her
alone
lady
agnes
wandered
joylessly
with
the
girls
in
the
palais
royal
and
the
rue
de
richelieu
and
emerged
upon
the
boulevard
where
they
continued
their
frugal
prowl
as
biddy
rather
irritatingly
called
it
they
went
into
five
shops
to
buy
a
hat
for
biddy
and
her
ladyship
presumptions
of
cheapness
were
woefully
belied
who
in
the
world
your
comic
friend
peter
sherringham
was
meanwhile
asking
of
his
kinsman
as
they
walked
together
ah
there
something
else
you
lost
by
going
to
cambridge
you
lost
gabriel
nash
he
sounds
like
an
elizabethan
dramatist
sherringham
said
but
i
have
lost
him
since
it
appears
now
i
sha
be
able
to
have
you
without
him
oh
as
for
that
wait
a
little
i
going
to
try
him
again
but
i
know
how
he
wears
what
i
mean
is
that
you
probably
lost
his
freshness
which
was
the
great
thing
i
rather
fear
he
becoming
conventional
or
at
any
rate
serious
bless
me
do
you
call
that
serious
he
used
to
be
so
gay
he
had
a
real
genius
for
playing
with
ideas
he
was
a
wonderful
talker
it
seems
to
me
he
does
very
well
now
said
peter
sherringham
oh
this
is
nothing
he
had
great
flights
of
old
very
great
flights
one
saw
him
rise
and
rise
and
turn
somersaults
in
the
blue
one
wondered
how
far
he
could
go
he
very
intelligent
and
i
should
think
it
might
be
interesting
to
find
out
what
it
is
that
prevents
the
whole
man
from
being
as
good
as
his
parts
i
mean
in
case
he
is
so
good
i
see
you
more
than
suspect
that
may
it
be
simply
that
he
too
great
an
ass
that
would
be
the
whole
i
shall
see
in
time
but
it
certainly
one
of
the
parts
it
may
be
the
effect
but
it
is
the
cause
and
for
the
cause
i
claim
an
interest
do
you
think
him
an
ass
for
what
he
said
about
the
theatre
his
pronouncing
it
a
coarse
art
to
differ
from
you
about
him
that
reason
would
do
said
sherringham
the
only
bad
one
would
be
one
that
should
preserve
our
difference
you
need
tell
me
you
agree
with
him
for
frankly
i
do
care
then
your
passion
still
burns
nick
dormer
asked
my
passion
i
do
mean
for
any
individual
exponent
of
the
equivocal
art
mark
the
guilty
conscience
mark
the
rising
blush
mark
the
confusion
of
mind
i
mean
the
old
sign
one
knew
you
best
by
your
permanent
stall
at
the
français
your
inveterate
attendance
at
the
way
you
the
young
talents
and
the
old
yes
it
still
my
little
hobby
my
little
folly
if
you
like
sherringham
said
i
do
find
i
get
tired
of
it
what
will
you
have
strong
predilections
are
rather
a
blessing
they
simplifying
fond
of
representation
the
representation
of
life
i
like
it
better
i
think
than
the
real
thing
you
like
it
too
you
be
ready
in
other
conditions
to
go
in
for
it
in
your
way
so
you
no
right
to
cast
the
stone
you
like
it
best
done
by
one
vehicle
and
i
by
another
and
our
preference
on
either
side
has
a
deep
root
in
us
there
a
fascination
to
me
in
the
way
the
actor
does
it
when
his
talent
ah
he
must
have
that
has
been
highly
trained
ah
it
must
that
the
things
he
can
do
in
this
effort
at
representation
with
the
dramatist
to
back
him
seem
to
me
innumerable
he
can
carry
it
to
a
point
and
i
take
great
pleasure
in
observing
them
in
recognising
and
comparing
them
it
an
amusement
like
another
i
do
pretend
to
call
it
by
any
exalted
name
but
in
this
vale
of
friction
it
will
serve
one
can
lose
one
self
in
it
and
it
has
the
recommendation
in
common
i
suppose
with
the
study
of
the
other
arts
that
the
further
you
go
in
it
the
more
you
find
so
i
go
rather
far
if
you
will
but
is
it
the
principal
sign
one
knows
me
by
peter
abruptly
asked
do
be
ashamed
of
it
nick
returned
else
it
will
be
ashamed
of
you
i
ought
to
discriminate
you
distinguished
among
my
friends
and
relations
by
your
character
of
rising
young
diplomatist
but
you
know
i
always
want
the
final
touch
to
the
picture
the
last
fruit
of
analysis
therefore
i
make
out
that
you
conspicuous
among
rising
young
diplomatists
for
the
infatuation
you
describe
in
such
pretty
terms
you
evidently
believe
it
will
prevent
my
ever
rising
very
high
but
pastime
for
pastime
is
it
any
idler
than
yours
than
mine
why
you
while
i
only
allow
myself
the
luxury
of
one
for
the
theatre
my
sole
vice
really
is
this
more
wanton
say
than
to
devote
weeks
to
the
consideration
of
the
particular
way
in
which
your
friend
nash
may
be
most
intensely
a
twaddler
and
a
bore
that
not
my
ideal
of
choice
recreation
but
i
undertake
to
satisfy
you
about
him
sooner
you
a
young
statesman
who
happens
to
be
an
for
the
moment
but
you
spend
not
a
little
of
your
time
in
besmearing
canvas
with
pigments
the
idea
of
representation
fascinates
you
but
in
your
case
it
representation
in
oils
or
do
you
practise
and
pastel
too
you
even
go
much
further
than
i
for
i
study
my
art
of
predilection
only
in
the
works
of
others
i
do
aspire
to
leave
works
of
my
own
you
a
painter
possibly
a
great
one
but
i
not
an
actor
nick
dormer
declared
he
would
certainly
become
one
he
was
so
well
on
the
way
to
it
and
sherringham
without
heeding
this
charge
went
on
let
me
add
that
considering
you
a
painter
your
portrait
of
the
complicated
nash
is
lamentably
dim
he
not
at
all
complicated
he
only
too
simple
to
give
an
account
of
most
people
have
a
lot
of
attributes
and
appendages
that
dress
them
up
and
superscribe
them
and
what
i
like
gabriel
for
is
that
he
any
at
all
it
makes
him
it
keeps
him
so
refreshingly
cool
by
jove
you
match
him
there
is
it
an
appendage
and
an
attribute
to
escape
kicking
how
does
he
manage
that
sherringham
asked
i
have
the
least
idea
i
do
know
that
he
does
rouse
the
kicking
impulse
besides
he
can
kick
back
and
i
do
think
any
one
has
ever
seen
him
duck
or
dodge
his
means
his
profession
his
belongings
have
never
anything
to
do
with
the
question
he
does
shade
off
into
other
people
he
as
neat
as
an
outline
cut
out
of
paper
with
scissors
i
like
him
therefore
because
in
dealing
with
him
you
know
what
got
hold
of
with
most
men
you
do
to
pick
the
flower
you
must
break
off
the
whole
dusty
thorny
worldly
branch
you
find
you
taking
up
in
your
grasp
all
sorts
of
other
people
and
things
dangling
accidents
and
conditions
poor
nash
has
none
of
those
encumbrances
he
the
blossom
my
dear
fellow
you
be
better
for
a
little
of
the
same
pruning
sherringham
retorted
and
the
young
men
continued
their
walk
and
their
gossip
jerking
each
other
this
way
and
that
punching
each
other
here
and
there
with
an
amicable
roughness
consequent
on
their
having
been
boys
together
intimacy
had
reigned
of
old
between
the
little
sherringhams
and
the
little
dormers
united
in
the
country
by
ease
of
neighbouring
and
by
the
fact
that
there
was
first
cousinship
not
neglected
among
the
parents
lady
agnes
standing
in
this
plastic
relation
to
lady
windrush
the
mother
of
peter
and
julia
as
well
as
of
other
daughters
and
of
a
maturer
youth
who
was
to
inherit
and
who
since
then
had
inherited
the
ancient
barony
many
things
had
altered
later
on
but
not
the
good
reasons
for
not
explaining
one
of
our
young
men
had
gone
to
eton
and
the
other
to
harrow
the
scattered
school
on
the
hill
was
the
tradition
of
the
dormers
and
the
divergence
had
rather
taken
its
course
in
university
years
bricket
however
had
remained
accessible
to
windrush
and
windrush
to
bricket
to
which
estate
percival
dormer
had
now
succeeded
terminating
the
interchange
a
trifle
rudely
by
letting
out
that
pleasant
white
house
in
the
midlands
its
expropriated
inhabitants
lady
agnes
and
her
daughters
adored
it
to
an
american
reputed
rich
who
in
the
first
flush
of
his
sense
of
contrasts
considered
that
for
twelve
hundred
a
year
he
got
it
at
a
bargain
bricket
had
come
to
the
late
sir
nicholas
from
his
elder
brother
dying
wifeless
and
childless
the
new
baronet
so
different
from
his
father
though
recalling
at
some
points
the
uncle
after
whom
he
had
been
named
that
nick
had
to
make
it
up
by
cultivating
conformity
roamed
about
the
world
taking
shots
which
excited
the
enthusiasm
of
society
when
society
heard
of
them
at
the
few
legitimate
creatures
of
the
chase
the
british
rifle
had
up
to
that
time
spared
lady
agnes
meanwhile
settled
with
her
girls
in
a
gabled
latticed
house
in
a
mentionable
quarter
though
it
still
required
a
little
explaining
of
the
temperate
zone
of
london
it
was
not
into
her
lap
poor
woman
that
the
revenues
of
bricket
were
poured
there
was
no
attached
to
that
moderate
property
and
the
allowance
with
which
the
estate
was
charged
on
her
ladyship
behalf
was
not
an
incitement
to
grandeur
nick
had
a
room
under
his
mother
roof
which
he
mainly
used
to
dress
for
dinner
when
dining
in
calcutta
gardens
and
he
had
kept
on
his
chambers
in
the
temple
for
to
a
young
man
in
public
life
an
independent
address
was
indispensable
moreover
he
was
suspected
of
having
a
studio
in
an
district
the
indistinguishable
parts
of
south
kensington
incongruous
as
such
a
retreat
might
seem
in
the
case
of
a
member
of
parliament
it
was
an
absurd
place
to
see
his
constituents
unless
he
wanted
to
paint
their
portraits
a
kind
of
representation
with
which
they
would
scarce
have
been
satisfied
and
in
fact
the
only
question
of
portraiture
had
been
when
the
wives
and
daughters
of
several
of
them
expressed
a
wish
for
the
picture
of
their
handsome
young
member
nick
had
not
offered
to
paint
it
himself
and
the
studio
was
taken
for
granted
rather
than
much
looked
into
by
the
ladies
in
calcutta
gardens
too
express
a
disposition
to
regard
whims
of
this
sort
as
extravagance
pure
and
simple
was
known
by
them
to
be
open
to
correction
for
they
were
not
oblivious
that
carteret
had
humours
which
weighed
against
them
in
the
shape
of
convenient
cheques
nestling
between
the
inside
pages
of
legible
letters
of
advice
carteret
was
nick
providence
just
as
nick
was
looked
to
in
a
general
way
to
be
that
of
his
mother
and
sisters
especially
since
it
had
become
so
plain
that
percy
who
was
not
subtly
selfish
would
operate
mainly
with
a
quite
out
of
that
sphere
it
was
not
for
studios
certainly
that
carteret
sent
cheques
but
they
were
an
expression
of
general
confidence
in
nick
and
a
little
expansion
was
natural
to
a
young
man
enjoying
such
a
luxury
as
that
it
was
sufficiently
felt
in
calcutta
gardens
that
he
could
be
looked
to
not
to
betray
such
confidence
for
carteret
behaviour
could
have
no
name
at
all
unless
one
were
prepared
to
call
it
encouraging
he
had
never
promised
anything
but
he
was
one
of
the
delightful
persons
with
whom
the
redemption
precedes
or
dispenses
with
the
vow
he
had
been
an
early
and
lifelong
friend
of
the
late
right
honourable
gentleman
a
political
follower
a
devoted
admirer
a
stanch
supporter
in
difficult
hours
he
had
never
married
espousing
nothing
more
reproductive
than
sir
nicholas
views
he
used
to
write
letters
to
the
in
favour
of
them
and
had
so
far
as
was
known
neither
chick
nor
child
nothing
but
an
amiable
little
family
of
eccentricities
the
flower
of
which
was
his
odd
taste
for
living
in
a
small
steep
clean
country
town
all
green
gardens
and
red
walls
with
a
girdle
of
all
clustered
about
an
immense
brown
old
abbey
when
lady
agnes
imagination
rested
upon
the
future
of
her
second
son
she
liked
to
remember
that
carteret
had
nothing
to
keep
up
the
inference
seemed
so
direct
that
he
would
keep
up
nick
the
most
important
event
in
the
life
of
this
young
man
had
been
incomparably
his
success
under
his
father
eyes
more
than
two
years
before
in
the
sharp
contest
for
crockhurst
a
victory
which
his
consecrated
name
his
extreme
youth
his
ardour
in
the
fray
the
marked
personal
sympathy
of
the
party
and
the
attention
excited
by
the
fresh
cleverness
of
his
speeches
tinted
with
young
idealism
and
yet
sticking
sufficiently
to
the
question
the
burning
question
which
has
since
burned
out
had
made
quite
splendid
there
had
been
leaders
in
the
newspapers
about
it
half
in
compliment
to
her
husband
who
was
known
to
be
failing
so
prematurely
he
was
almost
as
young
to
die
and
to
die
famous
for
lady
agnes
regarded
it
as
famous
as
his
son
had
been
to
stand
tributes
the
boy
mother
religiously
preserved
cut
out
and
tied
together
with
a
ribbon
in
the
innermost
drawer
of
a
favourite
cabinet
but
it
had
been
a
barren
or
almost
a
barren
triumph
for
in
the
order
of
importance
in
nick
history
another
incident
had
run
it
as
the
phrase
is
very
close
nothing
less
than
the
quick
dissolution
of
the
parliament
in
which
he
was
so
manifestly
destined
to
give
symptoms
of
a
future
he
had
not
recovered
his
seat
at
the
general
election
for
the
second
contest
was
even
sharper
than
the
first
and
the
tories
had
put
forward
a
loud
vulgar
rattling
bullying
man
it
was
to
a
certain
extent
a
comfort
that
poor
sir
nicholas
who
had
been
witness
of
the
bright
hour
should
have
passed
away
before
the
darkness
he
died
with
all
his
hopes
on
his
second
son
head
unconscious
of
near
disappointment
handing
on
the
torch
and
the
tradition
after
a
long
supreme
interview
with
nick
at
which
lady
agnes
had
not
been
present
but
which
she
knew
to
have
been
a
thorough
paternal
dedication
an
august
communication
of
ideas
on
the
highest
national
questions
she
had
reason
to
believe
he
had
touched
on
those
of
external
as
well
as
of
domestic
and
of
colonial
policy
leaving
on
the
boy
nature
and
manner
from
that
moment
the
most
unmistakable
traces
if
his
tendency
to
reverie
increased
it
was
because
he
had
so
much
to
think
over
in
what
his
pale
father
had
said
to
him
in
the
hushed
dim
chamber
laying
on
him
the
great
mission
that
death
had
cut
short
breathing
into
him
with
unforgettable
solemnity
the
very
accents
sir
nicholas
voice
had
been
wonderful
for
richness
that
he
was
to
sound
again
it
was
work
cut
out
for
a
lifetime
and
that
power
in
relation
to
detail
which
was
one
of
the
great
characteristics
of
the
lamented
high
distinction
the
most
analytic
of
the
weekly
papers
was
always
talking
about
it
had
enabled
him
to
rescue
the
prospect
from
any
shade
of
vagueness
or
of
ambiguity
five
years
before
nick
dormer
went
up
to
be
questioned
by
the
electors
of
crockhurst
peter
sherringham
had
appeared
before
a
board
of
examiners
who
let
him
off
much
less
easily
though
there
were
also
some
flattering
prejudices
in
his
favour
such
influences
being
a
part
of
the
copious
light
unembarrassing
baggage
with
which
each
of
the
young
men
began
life
peter
passed
however
passed
high
and
had
his
reward
in
prompt
assignment
to
small
subordinate
diplomatic
duties
in
germany
since
then
he
had
had
his
professional
adventures
which
need
not
arrest
us
inasmuch
as
they
had
all
paled
in
the
light
of
his
appointment
nearly
three
years
previous
to
the
moment
of
our
making
his
acquaintance
to
a
secretaryship
of
embassy
in
paris
he
had
done
well
and
had
gone
fast
and
for
the
present
could
draw
his
breath
at
ease
it
pleased
him
better
to
remain
in
paris
as
a
subordinate
than
to
go
to
honduras
as
a
principal
and
nick
dormer
had
not
put
a
false
colour
on
the
matter
in
speaking
of
his
stall
at
the
théâtre
français
as
a
sedative
to
his
ambition
nick
inferiority
in
age
to
his
cousin
sat
on
him
more
lightly
than
when
they
had
been
in
their
teens
and
indeed
no
one
can
very
well
be
much
older
than
a
young
man
who
has
figured
for
a
year
however
imperceptibly
in
the
house
of
commons
separation
and
diversity
had
made
them
reciprocally
strange
enough
to
give
a
price
to
what
they
shared
they
were
friends
without
being
particular
friends
that
further
degree
could
always
hang
before
them
as
a
suitable
but
not
oppressive
contingency
and
they
were
both
conscious
that
it
was
in
their
interest
to
keep
certain
differences
to
chaff
each
other
about
so
possible
was
it
that
they
might
have
quarrelled
if
they
had
had
everything
in
common
peter
as
being
was
a
little
irritated
to
find
his
cousin
always
so
intensely
british
while
nick
dormer
made
him
the
object
of
the
same
compassionate
criticism
recognised
in
him
a
rare
knack
with
foreign
tongues
but
reflected
and
even
with
extravagance
declared
that
it
was
a
pity
to
have
gone
so
far
from
home
only
to
remain
so
homely
moreover
nick
had
his
ideas
about
the
diplomatic
mind
finding
in
it
for
his
own
sympathy
always
the
wrong
turn
dry
narrow
barren
poor
he
pronounced
it
in
familiar
conversation
with
the
clever
secretary
wanting
in
imagination
in
generosity
in
the
finest
perceptions
and
the
highest
courage
this
served
as
well
as
anything
else
to
keep
the
peace
between
them
it
was
a
necessity
of
their
friendly
intercourse
that
they
should
scuffle
a
little
and
it
scarcely
mattered
what
they
scuffled
about
nick
dormer
express
enjoyment
of
paris
the
on
the
quays
the
old
books
on
the
parapet
the
gaiety
of
the
river
the
grandeur
of
the
louvre
every
fine
feature
of
that
prodigious
face
struck
his
companion
as
a
sign
of
insularity
the
appreciation
of
such
things
having
become
with
sherringham
an
unconscious
habit
a
contented
assimilation
if
poor
nick
for
the
hour
was
demonstrative
and
lyrical
it
was
because
he
had
no
other
way
of
sounding
the
note
of
farewell
to
the
independent
life
of
which
the
term
seemed
now
definitely
in
sight
the
sense
so
pressed
upon
him
that
these
were
the
last
moments
of
his
freedom
he
would
waste
time
till
seven
because
seven
meant
dinner
and
dinner
meant
his
mother
solemnly
attended
by
the
strenuous
shade
of
his
father
and
by
julia
vi
when
he
arrived
with
the
three
members
of
his
family
at
the
restaurant
of
their
choice
peter
sherringham
was
already
seated
there
by
one
of
the
immaculate
tables
but
dallow
was
not
yet
on
the
scene
and
they
had
time
for
a
sociable
settlement
time
to
take
their
places
and
unfold
their
napkins
crunch
their
rolls
breathe
the
savoury
air
and
watch
the
door
before
the
usual
raising
of
heads
and
suspension
of
forks
the
sort
of
stir
that
accompanied
most
of
this
lady
movements
announced
her
entrance
the
de
ducked
and
the
people
looked
round
peter
and
nick
got
up
there
was
a
shuffling
of
chairs
julia
had
come
peter
was
relating
how
he
had
stopped
at
her
hotel
to
bring
her
with
him
and
had
found
her
according
to
her
custom
by
no
means
ready
on
which
fearing
his
guests
would
arrive
first
at
the
rendezvous
and
find
no
proper
welcome
he
had
come
off
without
her
leaving
her
to
follow
he
had
not
brought
a
friend
as
he
intended
having
divined
that
julia
would
prefer
a
pure
family
party
if
she
wanted
to
talk
about
her
candidate
now
she
stood
looking
down
at
the
table
and
her
expectant
kinsfolk
drawing
off
her
gloves
letting
her
brother
draw
off
her
jacket
lifting
her
hands
for
some
rearrangement
of
her
hat
she
looked
at
nick
last
smiling
but
only
for
a
moment
she
said
to
peter
are
we
going
to
dine
here
oh
dear
why
did
you
have
a
private
room
nick
had
not
seen
her
at
all
for
several
weeks
and
had
seen
her
but
little
for
a
year
but
her
cursory
manner
had
not
altered
in
the
interval
she
spoke
remarkably
fast
as
if
speech
were
not
in
itself
a
pleasure
to
have
it
over
as
soon
as
possible
and
her
was
of
the
dark
shade
friendly
critics
account
for
by
pleading
shyness
shyness
had
never
appeared
to
him
an
ultimate
quality
or
a
real
explanation
of
anything
it
only
explained
an
effect
by
another
effect
neither
with
a
cause
to
boast
of
what
he
suspected
in
julia
was
that
her
mind
was
less
pleasing
than
her
person
an
ugly
a
really
blighting
idea
which
as
yet
he
had
but
half
accepted
it
was
a
case
in
which
she
was
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
every
doubt
and
ought
to
be
judged
without
a
complete
trial
nick
meanwhile
was
afraid
of
the
trial
this
was
partly
why
he
had
been
of
late
to
see
her
so
little
because
he
was
afraid
of
the
sentence
afraid
of
anything
that
might
work
to
lessen
the
charm
it
was
actually
in
the
power
of
her
beauty
to
shed
there
were
people
who
thought
her
rude
and
he
hated
rude
women
if
he
should
fasten
on
that
view
or
rather
if
that
view
should
fasten
on
him
what
could
still
please
and
what
he
admired
in
her
would
lose
too
much
of
its
sweetness
if
it
be
thought
odd
that
he
had
not
yet
been
able
to
read
the
character
of
a
woman
he
had
known
since
childhood
the
answer
is
that
this
character
had
grown
faster
than
nick
observation
the
growth
was
constant
whereas
the
observation
was
but
occasional
though
it
had
begun
early
if
he
had
attempted
inwardly
to
phrase
the
matter
as
he
probably
had
not
he
might
have
pronounced
the
effect
she
produced
upon
him
too
much
a
compulsion
not
the
coercion
of
design
of
importunity
nor
the
vulgar
pressure
of
family
expectation
a
betrayed
desire
he
should
like
her
enough
to
marry
her
but
a
mixture
of
divers
urgent
things
of
the
sense
that
she
was
imperious
and
generous
probably
more
the
former
than
the
latter
and
of
a
certain
prevision
of
doom
the
influence
of
the
idea
that
he
should
come
to
it
that
he
was
predestined
this
had
made
him
shrink
from
knowing
the
worst
about
her
not
the
wish
to
get
used
to
it
in
time
but
what
was
more
characteristic
of
him
the
wish
to
interpose
a
temporary
illusion
illusions
and
realities
and
hopes
and
fears
however
fell
into
confusion
whenever
he
met
her
after
a
separation
the
separation
so
far
as
seeing
her
alone
or
as
continuous
talk
was
concerned
had
now
been
tolerably
long
had
lasted
really
ever
since
his
failure
to
regain
his
seat
an
impression
had
come
to
him
that
she
judged
that
failure
rather
stiffly
had
thought
and
had
somewhat
sharply
said
that
he
ought
to
have
done
better
this
was
a
part
of
her
imperious
way
and
a
part
not
to
be
overlooked
on
a
mere
present
basis
if
he
were
to
marry
her
he
should
come
to
an
understanding
with
her
he
should
give
her
his
own
measure
as
well
as
take
hers
but
the
understanding
might
in
the
actual
case
suggest
too
much
that
he
to
marry
her
you
could
quarrel
with
your
wife
because
there
were
compensations
for
her
but
you
might
be
prepared
to
offer
these
compensations
as
prepayment
for
the
luxury
of
quarrelling
it
was
not
that
such
a
luxury
would
be
considerable
our
young
man
none
the
less
thought
as
julia
dallow
fine
head
poised
itself
before
him
again
a
high
spirit
was
of
course
better
than
a
mawkish
to
be
mismated
with
any
day
in
the
year
she
had
much
the
same
colour
as
her
brother
but
as
nothing
else
in
her
face
was
the
same
the
resemblance
was
not
striking
her
hair
was
of
so
dark
a
brown
that
it
was
commonly
regarded
as
black
and
so
abundant
that
a
plain
arrangement
was
required
to
keep
it
in
natural
relation
to
the
rest
of
her
person
her
eyes
were
of
a
grey
sometimes
pronounced
too
light
and
were
not
sunken
in
her
face
but
placed
well
on
the
surface
her
nose
was
perfect
but
her
mouth
was
too
small
and
nick
dormer
and
doubtless
other
persons
as
well
had
sometimes
wondered
how
with
such
a
mouth
her
face
could
have
expressed
decision
her
figure
helped
it
for
she
appeared
tall
being
extremely
slender
yet
was
not
and
her
head
took
turns
and
positions
which
though
a
matter
of
but
half
an
inch
out
of
the
common
this
way
or
that
somehow
contributed
to
the
air
of
resolution
and
temper
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
extreme
delicacy
of
line
and
surface
she
might
have
been
called
bold
but
as
it
was
she
looked
refined
and
quiet
refined
by
tradition
and
quiet
for
a
purpose
and
altogether
she
was
beautiful
with
the
gravity
of
her
elegant
head
her
hair
like
the
depths
of
darkness
her
eyes
like
its
earlier
clearing
her
mouth
like
a
rare
pink
flower
peter
said
he
had
not
taken
a
private
room
because
he
knew
tastes
she
liked
to
see
the
world
she
had
told
him
so
the
curious
people
the
coming
and
going
of
paris
oh
anything
for
biddy
julia
replied
smiling
at
the
girl
and
taking
her
place
lady
agnes
and
her
elder
daughter
exchanged
one
of
their
looks
and
nick
exclaimed
jocosely
that
he
did
see
why
the
whole
party
should
be
sacrificed
to
a
presumptuous
child
the
presumptuous
child
blushingly
protested
she
had
never
expressed
any
such
wish
to
peter
upon
which
nick
with
broader
humour
revealed
that
peter
had
served
them
so
out
of
stinginess
he
had
pitchforked
them
together
in
the
public
room
because
he
would
go
to
the
expense
of
a
he
had
brought
no
guest
no
foreigner
of
distinction
nor
diplomatic
swell
to
honour
them
and
now
they
would
see
what
a
paltry
dinner
he
would
give
them
peter
stabbed
him
indignantly
with
a
long
roll
and
lady
agnes
who
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
some
manifestation
on
dallow
part
which
did
come
concluded
with
a
certain
coldness
that
they
quite
sufficed
to
themselves
for
privacy
as
well
as
for
society
nick
called
attention
to
this
fine
phrase
of
his
mother
and
said
it
was
awfully
neat
while
grace
and
biddy
looked
harmoniously
at
julia
clothes
nick
felt
nervous
and
joked
a
good
deal
to
carry
it
off
a
levity
that
did
prevent
julia
saying
to
him
after
a
moment
you
might
have
come
to
see
me
you
know
you
get
my
message
from
peter
scold
him
julia
scold
him
well
i
begged
him
to
go
said
lady
agnes
and
to
this
grace
added
her
voice
with
an
oh
julia
do
give
it
to
him
these
words
however
had
not
the
effect
they
suggested
since
dallow
only
threw
off
for
answer
in
her
quick
curt
way
that
that
would
be
making
far
too
much
of
him
it
was
one
of
the
things
in
her
that
nick
mentally
pronounced
ungraceful
the
perversity
of
pride
or
of
shyness
that
always
made
her
disappoint
you
a
little
if
she
saw
you
expected
a
thing
she
snubbed
effusiveness
in
a
way
that
yet
gave
no
interesting
hint
of
any
wish
to
keep
it
herself
in
reserve
effusiveness
however
certainly
was
the
last
thing
of
which
lady
agnes
would
have
consented
to
be
accused
and
nick
while
he
replied
to
julia
that
he
was
sure
he
should
have
found
her
was
not
unable
to
perceive
the
operation
on
his
mother
of
that
shade
of
manner
he
ought
to
have
gone
he
owed
you
that
she
went
on
but
it
very
true
he
would
have
had
the
same
luck
as
we
i
went
with
the
girls
directly
after
luncheon
i
suppose
you
got
our
card
he
might
have
come
after
i
came
in
said
dallow
dear
julia
i
going
to
see
you
i
been
waiting
for
that
nick
returned
of
course
had
no
idea
when
you
come
in
said
lady
agnes
i
so
sorry
you
must
come
i
hate
calls
at
night
julia
serenely
added
well
then
will
you
roam
with
me
will
you
wander
through
paris
on
my
arm
nick
asked
smiling
will
you
take
a
drive
with
me
oh
that
would
be
perfection
cried
grace
i
thought
we
were
all
going
somewhere
to
the
hippodrome
peter
biddy
said
oh
not
all
just
you
and
me
laughed
peter
i
going
home
to
my
bed
i
earned
my
rest
lady
agnes
sighed
ca
peter
take
demanded
grace
nick
can
take
you
home
mamma
if
julia
wo
receive
him
and
i
can
look
perfectly
after
peter
and
biddy
take
them
to
something
amusing
please
take
them
dallow
said
to
her
brother
her
voice
was
kind
but
had
the
expectation
of
assent
in
it
and
nick
observed
both
the
good
nature
and
the
pressure
tired
poor
dear
she
continued
to
lady
agnes
fancy
your
being
dragged
about
so
what
did
you
come
over
for
my
mother
came
because
i
brought
her
nick
said
it
i
who
have
dragged
her
about
i
brought
her
for
a
little
change
i
thought
it
would
do
her
good
i
wanted
to
see
the
salon
it
is
a
bad
time
i
a
carriage
and
you
must
use
it
you
must
use
nothing
else
it
shall
take
you
everywhere
i
drive
you
about
julia
dropped
these
words
with
all
her
air
of
being
able
rather
than
of
wanting
but
nick
had
already
noted
and
he
noted
now
afresh
and
with
pleasure
that
her
lack
of
unction
interfered
not
a
bit
with
her
always
acting
it
was
quite
sufficiently
manifest
to
him
that
for
the
rest
of
the
time
she
might
be
near
his
mother
she
would
do
for
her
numberless
good
turns
she
would
give
things
to
the
girls
he
had
a
private
adumbration
of
that
expensive
parisian
perhaps
not
perfectly
useful
things
lady
agnes
was
a
woman
who
measured
outlays
and
returns
but
she
was
both
too
acute
and
too
just
not
to
recognise
the
scantest
offer
from
which
an
advantage
could
proceed
dear
julia
she
exclaimed
responsively
and
her
tone
made
this
brevity
of
acknowledgment
adequate
julia
own
few
words
were
all
she
wanted
it
so
interesting
about
harsh
she
added
we
immensely
excited
yes
nick
looks
it
pas
de
it
just
the
thing
for
you
you
know
julia
said
to
him
to
be
sure
he
knows
it
he
immensely
grateful
it
really
very
kind
of
you
you
do
me
a
very
great
honour
julia
nick
hastened
to
add
do
be
tiresome
please
that
lady
returned
we
talk
about
it
later
of
course
there
are
lots
of
points
nick
pursued
at
present
let
be
purely
convivial
somehow
harsh
is
such
a
false
note
here
causerons
de
my
dear
fellow
you
caught
exactly
the
tone
of
gabriel
nash
peter
sherringham
declared
on
this
who
gabriel
nash
dallow
asked
nick
is
he
a
gentleman
biddy
says
so
grace
dormer
interposed
before
this
inquiry
was
answered
it
to
be
supposed
that
any
one
nick
brings
to
lunch
with
us
lady
agnes
rather
coldly
sighed
ah
grace
with
your
tremendous
standard
her
son
said
while
peter
sherringham
explained
to
his
sister
that
nash
was
nick
new
mentor
or
oracle
whom
moreover
she
should
see
if
she
would
come
and
have
tea
with
him
i
have
the
least
desire
to
see
him
julia
made
answer
any
more
than
i
have
to
talk
about
harsh
and
bore
poor
peter
oh
certainly
dear
you
bore
me
her
brother
rang
out
one
thing
at
a
time
then
let
us
by
all
means
be
convivial
only
you
must
show
me
how
dallow
went
on
to
nick
what
does
he
mean
cousin
agnes
does
he
want
us
to
drain
the
to
flash
with
repartee
you
do
very
well
said
nick
you
thoroughly
charming
do
go
to
peter
julia
if
you
want
something
exciting
you
see
a
wonderful
girl
biddy
broke
in
with
her
smile
on
peter
wonderful
for
what
for
thinking
she
can
act
when
she
ca
said
the
roguish
biddy
dear
me
what
people
you
all
know
i
hate
peter
theatrical
people
and
are
you
going
home
julia
lady
agnes
inquired
home
to
the
hotel
dear
no
to
harsh
to
see
about
everything
i
in
the
midst
of
telegrams
i
do
know
yet
i
suppose
there
no
doubt
they
have
him
lady
agnes
decided
to
pursue
who
have
whom
why
the
local
people
and
the
party
managers
i
speaking
of
the
question
of
my
son
standing
they
have
the
person
i
want
them
to
have
i
daresay
there
are
so
many
people
in
it
in
one
way
or
another
it
dreadful
i
like
the
way
you
sit
there
julia
went
on
to
nick
so
do
i
he
smiled
back
at
her
and
he
thought
she
charming
now
because
she
was
gay
and
easy
and
willing
really
though
she
might
plead
incompetence
to
understand
how
jocose
a
dinner
in
a
pothouse
in
a
foreign
town
might
be
she
was
in
good
humour
or
was
going
to
be
and
not
grand
nor
stiff
nor
indifferent
nor
haughty
nor
any
of
the
things
people
who
disliked
her
usually
found
her
and
sometimes
even
a
little
made
him
believe
her
the
spirit
of
mirth
in
some
cold
natures
manifests
itself
not
altogether
happily
their
effort
of
recreation
resembles
too
much
the
bath
of
the
hippopotamus
but
when
dallow
put
her
elbows
on
the
table
one
felt
she
could
be
trusted
to
get
them
safely
off
again
for
a
family
in
mourning
the
dinner
was
lively
the
more
so
that
before
it
was
half
over
julia
had
arranged
that
her
brother
eschewing
the
inferior
spectacle
should
take
the
girls
to
the
théâtre
français
it
was
her
idea
and
nick
had
a
chance
to
observe
how
an
idea
was
apt
to
be
not
successfully
controverted
when
it
was
julia
even
the
programme
appeared
to
have
been
prearranged
to
suit
it
just
the
thing
for
the
cheek
of
the
young
person
ne
faut
jurer
de
and
de
la
peter
was
all
willingness
but
it
was
julia
who
settled
it
even
to
sending
for
the
newspaper
he
was
by
a
rare
accident
unconscious
of
the
evening
bill
and
to
reassuring
biddy
who
was
happy
but
anxious
on
the
article
of
their
being
too
late
for
good
places
peter
could
always
get
good
places
a
word
from
him
and
the
best
box
was
at
his
disposal
she
made
him
write
the
word
on
a
card
and
saw
a
messenger
despatched
with
it
to
the
rue
de
richelieu
and
all
this
without
loudness
or
insistence
parenthetically
and
authoritatively
the
box
was
bespoken
and
the
carriage
as
soon
as
they
had
had
their
coffee
found
to
be
in
attendance
peter
drove
off
in
it
with
the
girls
understanding
that
he
was
to
send
it
back
and
nick
waited
for
it
over
the
finished
repast
with
the
two
ladies
after
this
his
mother
was
escorted
to
it
and
conveyed
to
her
apartments
and
all
the
while
it
had
been
julia
who
governed
the
succession
of
events
do
be
nice
to
her
lady
agnes
breathed
to
him
as
he
placed
her
in
the
vehicle
at
the
door
of
the
café
and
he
guessed
it
gave
her
a
comfort
to
have
left
him
sitting
there
with
dallow
he
had
every
disposition
to
be
nice
to
his
charming
cousin
if
things
went
as
she
liked
them
it
was
the
proof
of
a
certain
fine
force
in
her
the
force
of
assuming
they
would
julia
had
her
differences
some
of
them
were
much
for
the
better
and
when
she
was
in
a
mood
like
this
evening
liberally
dominant
he
was
ready
to
encourage
most
of
what
she
took
for
granted
while
they
waited
for
the
return
of
the
carriage
which
had
rolled
away
with
his
mother
she
sat
opposite
him
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
playing
first
with
one
and
then
with
another
of
the
objects
that
encumbered
it
after
five
minutes
of
which
she
exclaimed
oh
i
say
well
go
and
got
up
abruptly
asking
for
her
jacket
he
said
something
about
the
carriage
and
its
order
to
come
back
for
them
and
she
replied
well
it
can
go
away
again
i
do
want
a
carriage
she
added
i
want
to
walk
and
in
a
moment
she
was
out
of
the
place
with
the
people
at
the
tables
turning
round
again
and
the
swaying
in
her
high
seat
on
the
pavement
of
the
boulevard
she
looked
up
and
down
there
were
people
at
little
tables
by
the
door
there
were
people
all
over
the
broad
expanse
of
the
asphalt
there
was
a
profusion
of
light
and
a
pervasion
of
sound
and
everywhere
though
the
establishment
at
which
they
had
been
dining
was
not
in
the
thick
of
the
fray
the
tokens
of
a
great
traffic
of
pleasure
that
of
paris
which
represents
it
as
a
huge
market
for
sensations
beyond
the
boulevard
des
capucines
it
flared
through
the
warm
evening
like
a
vast
bazaar
and
opposite
the
café
durand
the
madeleine
rose
theatrical
a
high
artful
before
the
footlights
of
the
rue
royale
where
shall
we
go
what
shall
we
do
dallow
asked
looking
at
her
companion
and
somewhat
to
his
surprise
as
he
had
supposed
she
wanted
but
to
go
home
anywhere
you
like
it
so
warm
we
might
drive
instead
of
going
indoors
we
might
go
to
the
bois
that
would
be
agreeable
yes
but
it
would
be
walking
however
that
does
matter
mild
enough
for
anything
for
sitting
out
like
all
these
people
and
i
never
walked
in
paris
at
night
it
would
amuse
me
nick
hesitated
so
it
might
but
it
is
particularly
recommended
to
ladies
i
do
care
for
that
if
it
happens
to
suit
me
very
well
then
we
walk
to
the
bastille
if
you
like
julia
hesitated
on
her
side
still
looking
about
it
too
far
tired
we
sit
here
and
she
dropped
beside
an
empty
table
on
the
terrace
of
durand
this
will
do
it
amusing
enough
and
we
can
look
at
the
madeleine
that
respectable
if
we
must
have
something
we
have
a
is
that
respectable
not
particularly
so
much
the
better
what
are
those
people
having
could
we
have
are
they
very
low
then
i
shall
have
one
i
been
so
wonderfully
good
i
been
staying
at
versailles
me
dois
bien
she
insisted
but
pronounced
the
thin
liquid
in
the
tall
glass
very
disgusting
when
it
was
brought
nick
was
amazed
reflecting
that
it
was
not
for
such
a
discussion
as
this
that
his
mother
had
left
him
with
hands
in
his
pockets
he
had
been
looking
out
but
as
his
eloquence
flowed
faster
he
turned
to
his
friend
who
had
dropped
upon
a
sofa
with
her
face
to
the
window
she
had
given
her
jacket
and
gloves
to
her
maid
but
had
kept
on
her
hat
and
she
leaned
forward
a
little
as
she
sat
clasping
her
hands
together
in
her
lap
and
keeping
her
eyes
on
him
the
lamp
in
a
corner
was
so
thickly
veiled
that
the
room
was
in
tempered
obscurity
lighted
almost
equally
from
the
street
and
the
brilliant
opposite
therefore
why
be
sapient
and
solemn
about
it
like
an
editorial
in
a
newspaper
nick
added
with
a
smile
she
continued
to
look
at
him
after
he
had
spoken
then
she
said
if
you
do
want
to
stand
you
only
to
say
so
you
need
give
your
reasons
it
too
kind
of
you
to
let
me
off
that
and
then
i
a
tremendous
fellow
for
reasons
that
my
strong
point
do
you
know
i
a
lot
more
besides
those
i
mentioned
done
up
and
ready
for
delivery
the
odd
thing
is
that
they
do
always
govern
my
behaviour
i
rather
think
i
do
want
to
stand
then
what
you
said
just
now
was
a
speech
julia
declared
a
speech
the
the
humbug
of
the
hustings
no
those
great
truths
remain
and
a
good
many
others
but
an
inner
voice
tells
me
i
in
for
it
and
it
will
be
much
more
graceful
to
embrace
this
opportunity
accepting
your
than
to
wait
for
some
other
and
forfeit
that
advantage
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
help
you
anywhere
she
went
on
thanks
awfully
he
returned
still
standing
there
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
you
do
it
best
in
your
own
place
and
i
no
right
to
deny
myself
such
a
help
julia
calmly
considered
i
do
do
it
badly
ah
you
so
political
of
course
i
am
it
the
only
decent
thing
to
be
but
i
can
only
help
you
if
you
help
yourself
i
can
do
a
good
deal
but
i
ca
do
everything
if
you
work
i
work
with
you
but
if
you
going
into
it
with
your
hands
in
your
pockets
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
nick
instantly
changed
the
position
of
these
members
and
sank
into
a
seat
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
you
very
clever
but
you
must
really
take
a
little
trouble
things
do
drop
into
people
mouths
i
try
i
try
i
a
great
incentive
he
admitted
of
course
you
have
my
mother
my
poor
mother
julia
breathed
some
vague
sound
and
he
went
on
and
of
course
always
my
father
dear
good
man
my
mother
even
more
political
than
you
i
daresay
she
is
and
quite
right
said
dallow
and
she
ca
tell
me
a
bit
more
than
you
can
what
she
thinks
what
she
believes
what
she
wants
pardon
me
i
can
tell
you
perfectly
there
one
thing
i
always
immensely
want
to
keep
out
a
tory
i
see
that
a
great
philosophy
it
will
do
very
well
and
i
desire
the
good
of
the
country
i
not
ashamed
of
that
and
can
you
give
me
an
idea
of
what
it
is
the
good
of
the
country
i
know
perfectly
what
it
is
it
is
what
the
tories
want
to
do
what
do
they
want
to
do
oh
it
would
take
me
long
to
tell
you
all
sorts
of
trash
it
would
take
you
long
and
it
would
take
them
longer
all
they
want
to
do
is
to
prevent
from
doing
on
our
side
we
want
to
prevent
them
from
preventing
us
that
about
as
clearly
as
we
all
see
it
so
on
both
sides
it
a
beautiful
lucid
inspiring
programme
i
do
believe
in
you
dallow
replied
to
this
leaning
back
on
her
sofa
i
hope
not
julia
indeed
he
paused
a
moment
still
with
his
face
toward
her
and
his
elbows
on
his
knees
then
he
pursued
you
a
very
accomplished
woman
and
a
very
zealous
one
but
you
have
an
idea
you
know
not
to
call
an
idea
what
you
mainly
want
is
to
be
at
the
head
of
a
political
salon
to
start
one
to
keep
it
up
to
make
it
a
success
much
you
know
me
julia
protested
but
he
could
see
through
the
dimness
that
her
face
spoke
differently
you
have
it
in
time
but
i
wo
come
to
it
nick
went
on
you
ca
come
less
than
you
do
when
i
say
you
have
it
i
mean
you
already
got
it
that
why
i
do
come
i
do
think
you
know
what
you
mean
said
dallow
i
an
idea
that
as
good
as
any
of
yours
any
of
those
you
treated
me
to
this
evening
it
seems
to
me
the
simple
idea
that
one
ought
to
do
something
or
other
for
one
country
or
other
certainly
covers
all
the
ground
there
one
thing
one
can
always
do
for
one
country
which
is
not
to
be
afraid
afraid
of
what
nick
dormer
waited
a
little
as
if
his
idea
amused
him
but
he
presently
said
i
tell
you
another
time
it
very
well
to
talk
so
glibly
of
standing
he
added
but
it
is
absolutely
foreign
to
the
question
that
i
have
got
the
cash
what
did
you
do
before
she
asked
the
first
time
my
father
paid
and
the
other
time
oh
mr
carteret
your
expenses
wo
be
at
all
large
on
the
contrary
said
julia
they
sha
be
i
shall
look
out
sharp
for
that
i
shall
have
the
great
hutchby
of
course
but
you
know
i
want
you
to
do
it
well
she
paused
an
instant
and
then
of
course
you
can
send
the
bill
to
me
thanks
awfully
you
tremendously
kind
i
should
think
of
that
nick
dormer
got
up
as
he
spoke
and
walked
to
the
window
again
his
companion
eyes
resting
on
him
while
he
stood
with
his
back
to
her
i
shall
manage
it
somehow
he
wound
up
carteret
will
be
delighted
said
julia
i
daresay
but
i
hate
taking
people
money
that
nonsense
when
it
for
the
country
is
it
for
when
they
get
it
back
nick
replied
turning
round
and
looking
for
his
hat
it
startlingly
late
you
must
be
tired
dallow
made
no
response
to
this
and
he
pursued
his
quest
successful
only
when
he
reached
a
duskier
corner
of
the
room
to
which
the
hat
had
been
relegated
by
his
cousin
maid
carteret
will
expect
so
much
if
he
pays
and
so
would
you
yes
i
bound
to
say
i
should
i
should
expect
a
great
deal
everything
and
dallow
emphasised
this
assertion
by
the
way
she
rose
erect
if
you
riding
for
a
fall
if
you
only
going
in
to
miss
it
you
had
better
stay
out
how
can
i
miss
it
with
the
young
man
smiled
she
uttered
a
word
impatiently
but
indistinguishably
and
he
continued
and
even
if
i
do
it
will
have
been
immense
fun
it
is
immense
fun
said
julia
but
the
best
fun
is
to
win
if
you
do
if
i
do
he
repeated
as
she
dropped
i
never
speak
to
you
again
how
much
you
expect
even
when
you
do
pay
dallow
rejoinder
was
a
justification
of
this
remark
expressing
as
it
did
the
fact
that
should
they
receive
on
the
morrow
information
on
which
she
believed
herself
entitled
to
count
information
tending
to
show
how
hard
the
conservatives
meant
to
fight
she
should
look
to
him
to
be
in
the
field
as
early
as
herself
sunday
was
a
lost
day
she
should
leave
paris
on
monday
oh
they
fight
it
hard
they
put
up
kingsbury
said
nick
smoothing
his
hat
they
all
come
down
all
that
can
get
away
and
kingsbury
has
a
very
handsome
wife
she
not
so
handsome
as
your
cousin
julia
smiled
oh
dear
no
a
cousin
sooner
than
a
wife
any
day
nick
laughed
as
soon
as
he
had
said
this
as
if
the
speech
had
an
awkward
side
but
the
reparation
perhaps
scarcely
mended
it
the
exaggerated
with
which
he
added
i
do
any
blessed
thing
you
tell
me
come
here
then
as
early
as
ten
she
turned
round
moving
to
the
door
with
him
but
before
they
reached
it
she
brought
out
pray
is
a
gentleman
to
do
anything
to
be
anything
to
be
anything
if
he
does
aspire
to
serve
the
state
aspire
to
make
his
political
fortune
do
you
mean
oh
bless
me
yes
there
are
other
things
what
other
things
that
can
compare
with
that
well
i
for
instance
i
very
fond
of
the
arts
of
the
arts
she
echoed
did
you
never
hear
of
them
i
awfully
fond
of
painting
at
this
julia
stopped
short
and
her
fine
grey
eyes
had
for
a
moment
the
air
of
being
set
further
forward
in
her
head
do
be
odious
she
said
turning
away
and
leaving
him
to
go
book
second
vii
peter
sherringham
reminded
nick
the
next
day
that
he
had
promised
to
be
present
at
madame
carré
interview
with
the
ladies
introduced
to
her
by
gabriel
nash
and
in
the
afternoon
conformably
to
this
arrangement
the
two
men
took
their
way
to
the
rue
de
constantinople
they
found
nash
and
his
friends
in
the
small
beflounced
of
the
old
actress
who
as
they
learned
had
sent
in
a
request
for
ten
minutes
grace
having
been
detained
at
a
lesson
a
rehearsal
of
the
de
about
to
be
given
for
a
charity
by
a
fine
lady
at
which
she
had
consented
to
be
present
as
an
adviser
rooth
sat
on
a
black
satin
sofa
with
her
daughter
beside
her
while
gabriel
nash
wandering
about
the
room
looked
at
the
votive
offerings
which
converted
the
little
panelled
box
decorated
in
sallow
white
and
gold
into
a
theatrical
museum
the
presents
the
portraits
the
wreaths
the
diadems
the
letters
framed
and
glazed
the
trophies
and
tributes
and
relics
collected
by
madame
carré
during
half
a
century
of
renown
the
profusion
of
this
testimony
was
hardly
more
striking
than
the
confession
of
something
missed
something
hushed
which
seemed
to
rise
from
it
all
and
make
it
melancholy
like
a
reference
to
clappings
which
in
the
nature
of
things
could
now
only
be
present
as
a
silence
so
that
if
the
place
was
full
of
history
it
was
the
form
without
the
fact
or
at
the
most
a
redundancy
of
the
one
to
a
pinch
of
the
other
the
history
of
a
mask
of
a
squeak
of
a
series
of
vain
gestures
some
of
the
objects
exhibited
by
the
distinguished
artist
her
early
portraits
in
lithograph
or
miniature
represented
the
costume
and
embodied
the
manner
of
a
period
so
remote
that
nick
dormer
as
he
glanced
at
them
felt
a
quickened
curiosity
to
look
at
the
woman
who
reconciled
being
alive
with
having
been
alive
so
long
ago
peter
sherringham
already
knew
how
she
managed
this
miracle
but
every
visit
he
paid
her
added
to
his
amused
charmed
sense
that
it
a
miracle
and
that
his
extraordinary
old
friend
had
seen
things
he
should
never
never
see
those
were
just
the
things
he
wanted
to
see
most
and
her
duration
her
survival
cheated
him
agreeably
and
helped
him
a
little
to
guess
them
his
appreciation
of
the
actor
art
was
so
systematic
that
it
had
an
antiquarian
side
and
at
the
risk
of
representing
him
as
attached
to
an
absurd
futility
it
must
be
said
that
he
had
as
yet
hardly
known
a
keener
regret
for
anything
than
for
the
loss
of
that
antecedent
world
and
in
particular
for
his
having
belatedly
missed
the
great
the
light
of
the
french
stage
in
the
early
years
of
the
century
of
whose
example
and
instruction
madame
carré
had
had
the
inestimable
benefit
she
had
often
described
to
him
her
rare
predecessor
straight
from
whose
hands
she
had
received
her
most
celebrated
parts
and
of
whom
her
own
manner
was
often
a
religious
imitation
but
her
descriptions
troubled
him
more
than
they
consoled
only
confirming
his
theory
to
which
so
much
of
his
observation
had
already
ministered
that
the
actor
art
in
general
was
going
down
and
down
descending
a
slope
with
abysses
of
vulgarity
at
its
foot
after
having
reached
its
perfection
more
than
fifty
years
ago
in
the
talent
of
the
lady
in
question
he
would
have
liked
to
dwell
for
an
hour
beneath
the
meridian
gabriel
nash
introduced
the
to
his
companions
but
the
younger
of
the
two
ladies
gave
no
sign
of
lending
herself
to
this
transaction
the
girl
was
very
white
she
huddled
there
silent
and
rigid
frightened
to
death
staring
expressionless
if
bridget
dormer
had
seen
her
at
this
moment
she
might
have
felt
avenged
for
the
discomfiture
of
her
own
spirit
suffered
at
the
salon
the
day
before
under
the
challenging
eyes
of
maud
vavasour
it
was
plain
at
the
present
hour
that
miss
vavasour
would
have
run
away
had
she
not
regarded
the
persons
present
as
so
many
guards
and
keepers
her
appearance
made
nick
feel
as
if
the
little
temple
of
art
in
which
they
were
collected
had
been
the
of
a
dentist
sherringham
had
seen
a
great
many
nervous
girls
tremble
before
the
same
ordeal
and
he
liked
to
be
kind
to
them
to
say
things
that
would
help
them
to
do
themselves
justice
the
probability
in
a
given
case
was
almost
overwhelmingly
in
favour
of
their
having
any
other
talent
one
could
think
of
in
a
higher
degree
than
the
dramatic
but
he
could
rarely
refrain
from
some
care
that
the
occasion
should
be
even
as
against
his
conscience
too
cruel
there
were
occasions
indeed
that
could
scarce
be
too
cruel
to
punish
properly
certain
examples
of
presumptuous
ineptitude
he
remembered
what
nash
had
said
about
this
blighted
maiden
and
perceived
that
though
she
might
be
inept
she
was
now
anything
but
presumptuous
gabriel
fell
to
talking
with
nick
dormer
while
peter
addressed
himself
to
rooth
there
was
no
use
as
yet
for
any
direct
word
to
the
girl
who
was
too
scared
even
to
hear
rooth
with
her
shawl
fluttering
about
her
nestled
against
her
daughter
putting
out
her
hand
to
take
one
of
soothingly
she
had
pretty
silly
eyes
a
long
thin
nose
and
an
upper
lip
which
projected
over
the
under
as
an
ornamental
cornice
rests
on
its
support
so
much
depends
really
everything
she
said
in
answer
to
some
sociable
observation
of
sherringham
it
either
this
and
she
rolled
her
eyes
expressively
about
the
room
or
it
i
do
know
what
perhaps
we
too
many
peter
hazarded
to
her
daughter
but
really
you
find
after
you
fairly
begin
that
you
do
better
with
four
or
five
before
she
answered
she
turned
her
head
and
lifted
her
fine
eyes
the
next
instant
he
saw
they
were
full
of
tears
the
words
she
spoke
however
though
uttered
as
if
she
had
tapped
a
silver
gong
had
not
the
note
of
sensibility
oh
i
do
care
for
he
laughed
at
this
declared
it
was
very
well
said
and
that
if
she
could
give
madame
carré
such
a
specimen
as
that
the
actress
came
in
before
he
had
finished
his
phrase
and
he
observed
the
way
the
girl
ruefully
rose
to
the
encounter
hanging
her
head
a
little
and
looking
out
from
under
her
brows
there
was
no
sentiment
in
her
face
only
a
vacancy
of
awe
and
anguish
which
had
not
even
the
merit
of
being
fine
of
its
kind
for
it
spoke
of
no
spring
of
reaction
yet
the
head
was
good
he
noted
at
the
same
moment
it
was
strong
and
salient
and
made
to
tell
at
a
distance
madame
carré
scarcely
heeded
her
at
first
greeting
her
only
in
her
order
among
the
others
and
pointing
to
seats
composing
the
circle
with
smiles
and
gestures
as
if
they
were
all
before
the
prompter
box
the
old
actress
presented
herself
to
a
casual
glance
as
a
raddled
woman
in
a
wig
with
beady
eyes
a
hooked
nose
and
pretty
hands
but
nick
dormer
who
had
a
sense
for
the
human
surface
soon
observed
that
these
comparatively
gross
marks
included
a
great
deal
of
delicate
detail
an
eyebrow
a
nostril
a
flitting
of
expressions
as
if
a
multitude
of
little
facial
wires
were
pulled
from
within
this
accomplished
artist
had
in
particular
a
mouth
which
was
visibly
a
rare
instrument
a
pair
of
lips
whose
curves
and
fine
corners
spoke
of
a
lifetime
of
points
unerringly
made
and
verses
exquisitely
spoken
helping
to
explain
the
purity
of
the
sound
that
issued
from
them
her
whole
countenance
had
the
look
of
long
service
of
a
thing
infinitely
worn
and
used
drawn
and
stretched
to
excess
with
its
elasticity
overdone
and
its
springs
relaxed
yet
religiously
preserved
and
kept
in
repair
even
as
some
valuable
old
timepiece
which
might
have
quivered
and
rumbled
but
could
be
trusted
to
strike
the
hour
at
the
first
words
she
spoke
gabriel
nash
exclaimed
endearingly
ah
la
voix
de
célimène
célimène
who
wore
a
big
red
flower
on
the
summit
of
her
dense
wig
had
a
very
grand
air
a
toss
of
the
head
and
sundry
little
majesties
of
manner
in
addition
to
which
she
was
strange
almost
grotesque
and
to
some
people
would
have
been
even
terrifying
capable
of
reappearing
with
her
hard
eyes
as
a
queer
vision
of
the
darkness
she
excused
herself
for
having
made
the
company
wait
and
mouthed
and
mimicked
in
the
drollest
way
with
intonations
as
fine
as
a
flute
the
performance
and
the
pretensions
of
the
to
whom
she
had
just
been
endeavouring
to
communicate
a
few
of
the
rudiments
mais
une
plaisanterie
she
went
on
to
rooth
whereas
you
and
your
daughter
i
sure
you
are
quite
another
matter
the
girl
had
got
rid
of
her
tears
and
was
gazing
at
her
and
rooth
leaned
forward
and
said
portentously
she
knows
four
languages
madame
carré
gave
one
of
her
histrionic
stares
throwing
back
her
head
that
three
too
many
the
thing
to
do
something
proper
with
one
we
very
much
in
earnest
continued
rooth
who
spoke
excellent
french
i
glad
to
hear
it
a
que
ça
la
tête
est
the
very
good
she
said
as
she
looked
at
the
girl
but
let
us
see
my
dear
child
what
you
got
in
it
the
young
lady
was
still
powerless
to
speak
she
opened
her
lips
but
nothing
came
with
the
failure
of
this
effort
she
turned
her
deep
sombre
eyes
to
the
three
men
beau
it
carries
well
madame
carré
further
commented
but
even
as
she
spoke
miss
rooth
fine
gaze
was
suffused
again
and
the
next
moment
she
had
definitely
begun
to
weep
nick
dormer
sprung
up
he
felt
embarrassed
and
intrusive
there
was
such
an
indelicacy
in
sitting
there
to
watch
a
poor
struggle
with
timidity
there
was
a
momentary
confusion
rooth
tears
were
seen
also
to
flow
nash
took
it
gaily
addressing
however
at
the
same
time
the
friendliest
most
familiar
encouragement
to
his
companions
and
peter
sherringham
offered
to
retire
with
nick
on
the
spot
should
their
presence
incommode
the
young
lady
but
the
agitation
was
over
in
a
minute
madame
carré
motioned
rooth
out
of
her
seat
and
took
her
place
beside
the
girl
and
nash
explained
judiciously
to
the
other
men
that
she
be
worse
should
they
leave
her
her
mother
begged
them
to
remain
so
that
there
should
be
at
least
some
english
she
spoke
as
if
the
old
actress
were
an
army
of
frenchwomen
the
young
heroine
of
the
occasion
quickly
came
round
and
madame
carré
on
the
sofa
beside
her
held
her
hand
and
emitted
a
perfect
music
of
reassurance
the
nerves
the
nerves
half
our
affair
have
as
many
as
you
like
if
you
got
something
else
too
do
you
know
anything
i
know
some
pieces
some
pieces
of
the
miriam
rooth
stared
as
if
she
did
understand
i
know
some
poetry
english
french
italian
german
said
her
mother
madame
carré
gave
rooth
a
look
which
expressed
irritation
at
the
recurrence
of
this
announcement
does
she
wish
to
act
in
all
those
tongues
the
is
the
comedy
it
only
to
show
you
how
she
has
been
educated
ah
there
no
education
that
matters
i
mean
save
the
right
one
your
daughter
must
have
a
particular
form
of
speech
like
me
like
you
see
if
i
can
speak
french
said
the
girl
smiling
dimly
at
her
hostess
she
appeared
now
almost
to
have
collected
herself
you
speak
it
in
perfection
and
english
just
as
well
said
miss
rooth
you
ought
to
be
an
actress
you
ought
to
be
a
governess
oh
do
tell
us
that
it
to
escape
from
that
pleaded
rooth
i
very
sure
your
daughter
will
escape
from
that
peter
sherringham
was
moved
to
interpose
oh
if
could
help
her
said
the
lady
with
a
world
of
longing
she
has
certainly
all
the
qualities
that
strike
the
eye
peter
returned
you
kind
sir
rooth
declared
elegantly
draping
herself
she
knows
célimène
i
heard
her
do
célimène
gabriel
nash
said
to
madame
carré
and
she
knows
juliet
she
knows
lady
macbeth
and
cleopatra
added
rooth
my
dear
child
do
you
wish
to
work
for
the
french
stage
or
for
the
english
the
old
actress
demanded
ours
would
have
sore
need
of
you
miss
rooth
sherringham
gallantly
threw
off
could
you
speak
to
any
one
in
london
could
you
introduce
her
her
mother
eagerly
asked
dear
madam
i
must
hear
her
first
and
hear
what
madame
carré
says
she
has
a
voice
of
rare
beauty
and
i
understand
voices
said
rooth
ah
then
if
she
has
intelligence
she
has
every
gift
she
has
a
most
poetic
mind
the
old
lady
went
on
i
should
like
to
paint
her
portrait
she
made
for
that
nick
dormer
ventured
to
observe
to
rooth
partly
because
struck
with
the
suitability
for
sitting
partly
to
mitigate
the
crudity
of
inexpressive
spectatorship
so
all
the
artists
say
i
had
three
or
four
heads
of
her
if
you
would
like
to
see
them
she
has
been
done
in
several
styles
if
you
were
to
do
her
i
sure
it
would
make
her
celebrated
and
me
too
nick
easily
laughed
it
would
indeed
a
member
of
parliament
nash
declared
ah
i
have
the
honour
murmured
rooth
looking
gratified
and
mystified
nick
explained
that
she
had
no
honour
at
all
and
meanwhile
madame
carré
had
been
questioning
the
girl
i
can
do
nothing
with
your
daughter
she
knows
too
much
she
broke
out
it
a
pity
because
i
like
to
catch
them
wild
oh
she
wild
enough
if
that
all
and
that
the
very
point
the
question
of
where
to
try
rooth
went
on
into
what
do
i
launch
her
upon
what
dangerous
stormy
sea
i
thought
of
it
so
anxiously
try
here
try
the
french
public
they
so
much
the
most
serious
said
gabriel
nash
ah
no
try
the
english
there
such
a
rare
opening
sherringham
urged
in
quick
opposition
oh
it
is
the
public
dear
gentlemen
it
the
private
side
the
other
people
it
the
life
it
the
moral
atmosphere
ne
connais
scène
la
madame
carré
declared
assured
by
every
one
who
knows
that
there
no
other
very
correctly
assured
said
nash
the
theatre
in
our
countries
is
puerile
and
barbarous
there
something
to
be
done
for
it
and
perhaps
mademoiselle
the
person
to
do
it
sherringham
contentiously
suggested
ah
but
what
can
it
do
for
her
madame
carré
asked
well
anything
i
can
help
to
bring
about
said
peter
sherringham
more
and
more
struck
with
the
girl
rich
type
miriam
rooth
sat
in
silence
while
this
discussion
went
on
looking
from
one
speaker
to
the
other
with
a
strange
dependent
candour
ah
if
your
part
marked
out
i
congratulate
you
mademoiselle
and
the
old
actress
underlined
the
words
as
she
had
often
underlined
others
on
the
stage
she
smiled
with
large
permissiveness
on
the
young
aspirant
who
appeared
not
to
understand
her
her
tone
penetrated
however
to
certain
depths
in
the
mother
nature
adding
another
stir
to
agitated
waters
i
feel
the
responsibility
of
what
she
shall
find
in
the
life
the
standards
of
the
theatre
rooth
explained
where
is
the
purest
tone
where
are
the
highest
standards
that
what
i
ask
the
good
lady
continued
with
a
misguided
intensity
which
elicited
a
peal
of
unceremonious
but
sociable
laughter
from
gabriel
nash
the
purest
tone
que
que
madame
carré
demanded
in
the
finest
manner
of
modern
comedy
we
very
respectable
rooth
went
on
but
now
smiling
and
achieving
lightness
too
what
i
want
is
to
place
my
daughter
where
the
conduct
and
the
picture
of
conduct
in
which
she
should
take
part
would
be
quite
absolutely
dreadful
now
how
about
all
that
how
about
in
the
french
theatre
all
the
things
she
should
see
the
things
she
should
hear
the
things
she
should
learn
her
hostess
took
it
as
sherringham
felt
i
do
think
i
know
what
you
talking
about
they
the
things
she
may
see
and
hear
and
learn
everywhere
only
they
better
done
they
better
said
above
all
they
better
taught
the
only
conduct
that
concerns
an
actress
it
seems
to
me
is
her
own
and
the
only
way
for
her
to
behave
herself
is
not
to
be
a
helpless
stick
i
know
no
other
conduct
but
there
are
characters
there
are
situations
which
i
do
think
i
should
like
to
see
undertake
there
are
many
no
doubt
which
she
would
do
well
to
leave
alone
laughed
the
frenchwoman
i
should
like
to
see
her
represent
a
very
bad
woman
a
bad
one
rooth
serenely
pursued
ah
in
england
then
and
in
your
theatre
every
one
immaculately
good
your
plays
must
be
even
more
ingenious
than
i
supposed
we
have
any
plays
said
gabriel
nash
people
will
write
them
for
miss
rooth
it
will
be
a
new
era
sherringham
threw
in
with
wanton
or
at
least
with
combative
optimism
will
sir
will
you
do
something
a
sketch
of
one
of
our
grand
english
ideals
the
old
lady
asked
engagingly
oh
i
know
what
you
do
with
our
pieces
to
show
your
superior
virtue
madame
carré
cried
before
he
had
time
to
reply
that
he
wrote
nothing
but
diplomatic
memoranda
bad
women
joué
que
ça
bad
i
tried
to
make
them
real
i
can
say
miriam
interrupted
in
a
cold
voice
which
seemed
to
hint
at
a
want
of
participation
in
the
maternal
solicitudes
allow
us
the
pleasure
of
hearing
you
then
madame
carré
will
give
you
the
said
peter
sherringham
certainly
my
child
i
can
say
it
without
the
book
madame
carré
responded
put
yourself
there
move
that
chair
a
little
away
she
patted
her
young
visitor
encouraging
her
to
rise
settling
with
her
the
scene
they
should
take
while
the
three
men
sprang
up
to
arrange
a
place
for
the
performance
miriam
left
her
seat
and
looked
vaguely
about
her
then
having
taken
off
her
hat
and
given
it
to
her
mother
she
stood
on
the
designated
spot
with
her
eyes
to
the
ground
abruptly
however
instead
of
beginning
the
scene
madame
carré
turned
to
the
elder
lady
with
an
air
which
showed
that
a
rejoinder
to
this
visitor
remarks
of
a
moment
before
had
been
gathering
force
in
her
breast
you
mix
things
up
and
i
have
it
on
my
heart
to
tell
you
so
i
believe
it
rather
the
case
with
you
other
english
and
never
been
able
to
learn
that
either
your
morality
or
your
talent
is
the
gainer
by
it
to
be
too
respectable
to
go
where
things
are
done
best
is
in
my
opinion
to
be
very
vicious
indeed
and
to
do
them
badly
in
order
to
preserve
your
virtue
is
to
fall
into
a
grossness
more
shocking
than
any
other
to
do
them
well
is
virtue
enough
and
not
to
make
a
mess
of
it
the
only
respectability
that
hard
enough
to
merit
paradise
everything
else
is
base
humbug
chère
the
answer
i
have
for
your
scruples
it
admirable
admirable
and
i
am
glad
my
friend
dormer
here
has
had
the
great
advantage
of
hearing
you
utter
it
nash
exclaimed
with
a
free
designation
of
nick
that
young
man
thought
it
in
effect
a
speech
denoting
an
intelligence
of
the
question
yet
he
rather
resented
the
idea
that
gabriel
should
assume
it
would
strike
him
as
a
revelation
and
to
show
his
familiarity
with
the
line
of
thought
it
indicated
as
well
as
to
play
his
part
appreciatively
in
the
little
circle
he
observed
to
rooth
as
if
they
might
take
many
things
for
granted
in
other
words
your
daughter
must
find
her
safeguard
in
the
artistic
conscience
but
he
had
no
sooner
spoken
than
he
was
struck
with
the
oddity
of
their
discussing
so
publicly
and
under
the
poor
girl
handsome
nose
the
conditions
which
miss
rooth
might
find
the
best
for
the
preservation
of
her
personal
integrity
however
the
anomaly
was
light
and
unoppressive
the
echoes
of
a
public
discussion
of
delicate
questions
seemed
to
linger
so
familiarly
in
the
egotistical
little
room
moreover
the
heroine
of
the
occasion
evidently
was
losing
her
embarrassment
she
was
the
priestess
on
the
tripod
awaiting
the
afflatus
and
thinking
only
of
that
her
bared
head
of
which
she
had
changed
the
position
holding
it
erect
while
her
arms
hung
at
her
sides
was
admirable
her
eyes
gazed
straight
out
of
the
window
and
at
the
houses
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
rue
de
constantinople
rooth
had
listened
to
madame
carré
with
startled
respectful
attention
but
nick
considering
her
was
very
sure
she
had
at
all
taken
in
the
great
artist
little
lesson
yet
this
did
prevent
her
from
exclaiming
in
answer
to
himself
oh
a
fine
artistic
life
what
indeed
is
more
beautiful
peter
sherringham
had
said
nothing
he
was
watching
miriam
and
her
attitude
she
wore
a
black
dress
which
fell
in
straight
folds
her
face
under
her
level
brows
was
pale
and
regular
it
had
a
strange
strong
tragic
beauty
i
do
know
what
in
her
he
said
to
himself
nothing
it
would
seem
from
her
persistent
vacancy
but
such
a
face
as
that
such
a
head
is
a
fortune
madame
carré
brought
her
to
book
giving
her
the
first
line
of
the
speech
of
clorinde
ne
me
fuyez
pas
mon
enfant
but
still
the
girl
hesitated
and
for
an
instant
appeared
to
make
a
vain
convulsive
effort
in
this
convulsion
she
frowned
portentously
her
low
forehead
overhung
her
eyes
the
eyes
themselves
in
shadow
stared
splendid
and
cold
and
her
hands
clinched
themselves
at
her
sides
she
looked
austere
and
terrible
and
was
during
this
moment
an
incarnation
the
vividness
of
which
drew
from
sherringham
a
stifled
cry
est
bien
belle
ah
murmured
the
old
actress
and
in
the
pause
which
still
preceded
the
issue
of
sound
from
the
girl
lips
peter
turned
to
his
kinsman
and
said
in
a
low
tone
you
must
paint
her
just
like
that
like
that
as
the
tragic
muse
she
began
to
speak
a
long
strong
colourless
voice
quavered
in
her
young
throat
she
delivered
the
lines
of
clorinde
in
the
admired
interview
with
célie
the
gem
of
the
third
act
with
a
rude
monotony
and
then
gaining
confidence
with
an
effort
at
modulation
which
was
not
altogether
successful
and
which
evidently
she
felt
not
to
be
so
madame
carré
sent
back
the
ball
without
raising
her
hand
repeating
the
speeches
of
célie
which
her
memory
possessed
from
their
having
so
often
been
addressed
to
her
and
uttering
the
verses
with
soft
communicative
art
so
they
went
on
through
the
scene
which
when
it
was
over
had
not
precisely
been
a
triumph
for
miriam
rooth
sherringham
forbore
to
look
at
gabriel
nash
and
madame
carré
said
i
think
you
a
voice
somewhere
or
other
we
must
try
and
put
our
hand
on
it
then
she
asked
her
what
instruction
she
had
had
and
the
girl
lifting
her
eyebrows
looked
at
her
mother
while
her
mother
prompted
her
delamere
in
london
she
was
once
an
ornament
of
the
english
stage
she
gives
lessons
just
to
a
very
few
it
a
great
favour
such
a
very
nice
person
but
above
all
signor
ruggieri
i
think
he
taught
us
most
rooth
explained
that
this
gentleman
was
an
italian
tragedian
in
rome
who
instructed
miriam
in
the
proper
manner
of
pronouncing
his
language
and
also
in
the
art
of
declaiming
and
gesticulating
gesticulating
i
warrant
declared
their
hostess
they
mimic
as
for
the
deaf
they
emphasise
as
for
the
blind
delamere
is
doubtless
an
epitome
of
all
the
virtues
but
i
never
heard
of
her
you
travel
too
much
madame
carré
went
on
that
very
amusing
but
the
way
to
study
is
to
stay
at
home
to
shut
yourself
up
and
hammer
at
your
scales
rooth
complained
that
they
had
no
home
to
stay
at
in
reply
to
which
the
old
actress
exclaimed
oh
you
english
you
légèreté
à
faire
if
you
have
a
home
you
must
make
or
at
least
for
decency
pretend
to
one
in
our
profession
it
the
first
requisite
but
where
that
what
i
ask
said
rooth
why
not
here
sherringham
threw
out
oh
here
and
the
good
lady
shook
her
head
with
a
world
of
sad
significance
come
and
live
in
london
and
then
i
shall
be
able
to
paint
your
daughter
nick
dormer
interposed
is
that
all
it
will
take
my
dear
fellow
asked
gabriel
nash
ah
london
full
of
memories
rooth
went
on
my
father
had
a
great
house
there
we
always
came
up
but
all
that
over
study
here
and
then
go
to
london
to
appear
said
peter
feeling
frivolous
even
as
he
spoke
to
appear
in
french
no
in
the
language
of
shakespeare
but
we
ca
study
that
here
sherringham
means
that
he
will
give
you
lessons
madame
carré
explained
let
me
not
fail
to
say
it
he
an
excellent
critic
how
do
you
know
that
you
who
beyond
criticism
and
perfect
asked
sherringham
an
inquiry
to
which
the
answer
was
forestalled
by
the
girl
rousing
herself
to
make
it
public
that
she
could
recite
the
nights
of
alfred
de
musset
diable
said
the
actress
that
more
than
i
can
by
all
means
give
us
a
specimen
the
girl
again
placed
herself
in
position
and
rolled
out
a
fragment
of
one
of
the
splendid
conversations
of
musset
poet
with
his
muse
rolled
it
loudly
and
proudly
tossed
it
and
tumbled
it
about
the
room
madame
carré
watched
her
at
first
but
after
a
few
moments
she
shut
her
eyes
though
the
best
part
of
the
business
was
to
take
in
her
young
candidate
beauty
sherringham
had
supposed
miriam
rather
abashed
by
the
flatness
of
her
first
performance
but
he
now
saw
how
little
she
could
have
been
aware
of
this
she
was
rather
uplifted
and
emboldened
she
made
a
mush
of
the
divine
verses
which
in
spite
of
certain
sonorities
and
cadences
an
evident
effort
to
imitate
a
celebrated
actress
a
comrade
of
madame
carré
whom
she
had
heard
declaim
them
she
produced
as
if
she
had
been
dashing
blindfold
at
some
playfellow
she
was
to
catch
when
she
had
finished
madame
carré
passed
no
judgement
only
dropping
perhaps
you
had
better
say
something
english
she
suggested
some
little
piece
of
verse
some
fable
if
there
were
fables
in
english
she
appeared
but
scantily
surprised
to
hear
that
there
were
not
it
was
a
language
of
which
one
expected
so
little
rooth
said
she
knows
her
tennyson
by
heart
i
think
he
much
deeper
than
la
fontaine
and
after
some
deliberation
and
delay
miriam
broke
into
the
from
which
she
passed
directly
almost
breathlessly
to
edward
gray
sherringham
had
by
this
time
heard
her
make
four
different
attempts
and
the
only
generalisation
very
present
to
him
was
that
she
uttered
these
dissimilar
compositions
in
exactly
the
same
tone
a
solemn
droning
dragging
measure
suggestive
of
an
exhortation
from
the
pulpit
and
adopted
evidently
with
the
affecting
intention
and
from
a
crude
idea
of
style
it
was
all
funereal
yet
was
artlessly
rough
sherringham
thought
her
english
performance
less
futile
than
her
french
but
he
could
see
that
madame
carré
listened
to
it
even
with
less
pleasure
in
the
way
the
girl
wailed
forth
some
of
her
tennysonian
lines
he
detected
a
faint
gleam
as
of
something
pearly
in
deep
water
but
the
further
she
went
the
more
violently
she
acted
on
the
nerves
of
gabriel
nash
that
also
he
could
discover
from
the
way
this
gentleman
ended
by
slipping
discreetly
to
the
window
and
leaning
there
with
his
head
out
and
his
back
to
the
exhibition
he
had
the
art
of
mute
expression
his
attitude
said
as
clearly
as
possible
no
no
you
ca
call
me
either
or
i
the
showman
of
the
occasion
moreover
and
i
avert
myself
leaving
you
to
judge
if
there
a
thing
in
life
i
hate
it
this
idiotic
new
fashion
of
the
recitation
and
of
the
insufferable
creatures
who
practise
it
who
prevent
conversation
and
whom
as
they
beneath
it
you
ca
punish
by
criticism
therefore
what
i
doing
only
too
magnanimous
bringing
these
benighted
women
here
paying
with
my
person
stifling
my
just
repugnance
while
sherringham
judged
privately
that
the
manner
in
which
miss
rooth
had
acquitted
herself
offered
no
element
of
interest
he
yet
remained
aware
that
something
surmounted
and
survived
her
failure
something
that
would
perhaps
be
worth
his
curiosity
it
was
the
element
of
outline
and
attitude
the
way
she
stood
the
way
she
turned
her
eyes
her
head
and
moved
her
limbs
these
things
held
the
attention
they
had
a
natural
authority
and
in
spite
of
their
suggesting
too
much
the
in
the
a
plastic
grandeur
her
face
moreover
grew
as
he
watched
it
something
delicate
dawned
in
it
a
dim
promise
of
variety
and
a
touching
plea
for
patience
as
if
it
were
conscious
of
being
able
to
show
in
time
more
shades
than
the
simple
and
striking
gloom
which
had
as
yet
mainly
graced
it
these
rather
rude
physical
felicities
formed
in
short
her
only
mark
of
a
vocation
he
almost
hated
to
have
to
recognise
them
he
had
seen
them
so
often
when
they
meant
nothing
at
all
that
he
had
come
at
last
to
regard
them
as
almost
a
guarantee
of
incompetence
he
knew
madame
carré
valued
them
singly
so
little
that
she
counted
them
out
in
measuring
an
histrionic
nature
when
deprived
of
the
escort
of
other
properties
which
helped
and
completed
them
she
almost
held
them
a
positive
hindrance
to
success
success
of
the
only
kind
she
esteemed
far
oftener
than
himself
she
had
sat
in
judgement
on
young
women
for
whom
hair
and
eyebrows
and
a
disposition
for
the
statuesque
would
have
worked
the
miracle
of
sanctifying
their
stupidity
if
the
miracle
were
workable
but
that
particular
miracle
never
was
the
qualities
she
rated
highest
were
not
the
gifts
but
the
conquests
the
effects
the
actor
had
worked
hard
for
had
dug
out
of
the
mine
by
unwearied
study
sherringham
remembered
to
have
had
in
the
early
part
of
their
acquaintance
a
friendly
dispute
with
her
on
this
subject
he
having
been
moved
at
that
time
to
defend
doubtless
to
excess
the
cause
of
the
gifts
she
had
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
a
serious
comedian
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
them
ashamed
of
resting
his
case
on
them
and
when
sherringham
had
cited
the
great
rachel
as
a
player
whose
natural
endowment
was
rich
and
who
had
owed
her
highest
triumphs
to
it
she
had
declared
that
rachel
was
the
very
instance
that
proved
her
point
a
talent
assisted
by
one
or
two
primary
aids
a
voice
and
a
portentous
brow
but
essentially
formed
by
work
unremitting
and
ferocious
work
i
do
care
a
straw
for
your
handsome
girls
she
said
but
bring
me
one
who
ready
to
drudge
the
tenth
part
of
the
way
rachel
drudged
and
forgive
her
her
beauty
of
course
rachel
was
a
that
a
gift
if
you
like
rooth
who
was
evidently
very
proud
of
the
figure
her
daughter
had
made
her
daughter
who
for
all
one
could
tell
affected
their
hostess
precisely
as
a
appealed
to
madame
carré
rashly
and
serenely
for
a
verdict
but
fortunately
this
lady
voluble
came
rattling
in
at
the
same
moment
with
the
the
old
actress
busied
herself
in
dispensing
this
refreshment
an
hospitable
attention
to
her
english
visitors
and
under
cover
of
the
diversion
thus
obtained
while
the
others
talked
together
sherringham
put
her
the
question
well
is
there
anything
in
my
young
friend
nothing
i
can
see
she
loud
and
coarse
she
very
much
afraid
you
must
allow
for
that
afraid
of
me
immensely
but
not
a
bit
afraid
of
her
authors
nor
of
you
madame
carré
smiled
are
you
prejudiced
by
what
that
fellow
nash
has
told
you
why
prejudiced
he
only
told
me
she
was
very
handsome
and
do
you
think
her
so
admirable
but
i
not
a
photographer
nor
a
dressmaker
nor
a
coiffeur
i
ca
do
anything
with
hair
nor
with
a
mere
big
stare
the
head
very
noble
said
peter
sherringham
and
the
voice
when
she
spoke
english
had
some
sweet
tones
ah
your
english
possibly
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
listened
to
her
conscientiously
and
i
did
perceive
in
what
she
did
a
single
a
single
inflexion
or
intention
but
not
one
i
do
think
she
intelligent
but
do
they
often
seem
stupid
at
first
say
always
then
do
some
succeed
even
when
they
handsome
when
they
handsome
they
always
succeed
in
one
way
or
another
you
do
understand
us
english
said
peter
sherringham
madame
carré
drank
her
tea
then
she
replied
marry
her
my
son
and
give
her
diamonds
make
her
an
ambassadress
she
look
very
well
she
interests
you
so
little
that
you
do
care
to
do
anything
for
her
to
do
anything
to
give
her
a
few
lessons
the
old
actress
looked
at
him
a
moment
after
which
rising
from
her
place
near
the
table
on
which
the
tea
had
been
served
she
said
to
miriam
rooth
my
dear
child
i
give
my
voice
for
the
you
did
the
english
things
best
did
i
do
them
well
asked
the
girl
you
a
great
deal
to
learn
but
you
rude
force
the
main
things
encore
a
but
they
come
you
must
work
i
think
she
has
ideas
said
rooth
she
gets
them
from
you
madame
carré
replied
i
must
say
that
if
it
to
be
theatre
i
relieved
i
do
think
ours
safer
the
good
lady
continued
ours
is
dangerous
no
doubt
you
mean
you
more
severe
said
the
girl
your
mother
right
the
actress
smiled
you
have
ideas
but
what
shall
we
do
then
how
shall
we
proceed
rooth
made
this
appeal
plaintively
and
vaguely
to
the
three
gentlemen
but
they
had
collected
a
few
steps
off
and
were
so
occupied
in
talk
that
it
failed
to
reach
them
work
work
work
exclaimed
the
actress
in
english
i
can
play
shakespeare
i
want
to
play
shakespeare
miriam
made
known
that
fortunate
as
in
english
you
have
any
one
else
to
play
but
he
so
great
and
he
so
pure
said
rooth
that
indeed
seems
the
saving
of
you
madame
carré
returned
you
think
me
actually
pretty
bad
do
you
the
girl
demanded
with
her
serious
face
dieu
que
vous
of
course
you
rough
but
so
was
i
at
your
age
and
if
you
find
your
voice
it
may
carry
you
far
besides
what
does
it
matter
what
i
think
how
can
i
judge
for
your
english
public
how
shall
i
find
my
voice
asked
miriam
rooth
by
trying
a
que
work
like
a
horse
night
and
day
besides
sherringham
as
he
says
will
help
you
that
gentleman
hearing
his
name
turned
round
and
the
girl
appealed
to
him
will
you
help
me
really
to
find
her
voice
said
madame
carré
the
voice
when
it
worth
anything
comes
from
the
heart
so
i
suppose
that
where
to
look
for
it
gabriel
nash
suggested
much
you
know
you
have
got
any
miriam
retorted
with
the
first
scintillation
of
gaiety
she
had
shown
on
this
occasion
any
voice
my
child
nash
inquired
any
heart
or
any
manners
peter
sherringham
made
the
secret
reflexion
that
he
liked
her
better
lugubrious
as
the
note
of
pertness
was
not
totally
absent
from
her
mode
of
emitting
these
few
words
he
was
irritated
moreover
for
in
the
brief
conference
he
had
just
had
with
the
young
lady
introducer
he
had
had
to
meet
the
rather
difficult
call
of
speaking
of
her
hopefully
nash
had
said
with
his
bland
smile
and
what
impression
does
my
young
friend
make
in
respect
to
which
peter
optimism
felt
engaged
by
an
awkward
logic
he
answered
that
he
recognised
promise
though
he
did
nothing
of
the
sort
at
the
same
time
that
the
poor
girl
both
with
the
exaggerated
points
of
her
person
and
the
vanity
of
her
attempt
at
expression
constituted
a
kind
of
challenge
struck
him
as
a
subject
for
inquiry
a
problem
an
explorable
tract
she
was
too
bad
to
jump
at
and
yet
too
taking
perhaps
after
all
only
vulgarly
to
overlook
especially
when
resting
her
tragic
eyes
on
him
with
the
trust
of
her
deep
really
this
note
affected
him
as
addressed
directly
to
his
honour
giving
him
a
chance
to
brave
verisimilitude
to
brave
ridicule
even
a
little
in
order
to
show
in
a
special
case
what
he
had
always
maintained
in
general
that
the
direction
of
a
young
person
studies
for
the
stage
may
be
an
interest
of
as
high
an
order
as
any
other
artistic
appeal
nash
has
rendered
us
the
great
service
of
introducing
us
to
madame
carré
and
i
sure
we
immensely
indebted
to
him
rooth
said
to
her
daughter
with
an
air
affectionately
corrective
but
what
good
does
that
do
us
the
girl
asked
smiling
at
the
actress
and
gently
laying
her
upon
her
hand
madame
carré
listens
to
me
with
adorable
patience
and
then
sends
me
about
my
business
ah
in
the
prettiest
way
in
the
world
mademoiselle
you
not
so
rough
the
tone
of
that
very
a
la
bonne
work
work
the
actress
cried
there
was
an
inflexion
there
or
very
nearly
practise
it
till
you
got
it
come
and
practise
it
to
if
your
mother
will
be
so
kind
as
to
bring
you
said
peter
sherringham
do
you
give
lessons
do
you
understand
miriam
asked
i
an
old
and
i
an
unbounded
belief
in
my
own
judgement
sir
is
too
much
to
say
rooth
remonstrated
my
daughter
knows
your
high
position
but
she
very
direct
you
always
find
her
so
perhaps
you
say
there
are
less
honourable
faults
we
come
to
see
you
with
pleasure
oh
i
been
at
the
embassy
when
i
was
her
age
therefore
why
should
she
go
that
was
in
lord
time
a
few
people
are
coming
to
tea
with
me
perhaps
you
come
then
at
five
it
will
remind
me
of
the
dear
old
times
said
rooth
thank
you
i
try
and
do
better
miriam
professed
very
sweetly
you
do
better
every
minute
sherringham
returned
and
he
looked
at
their
hostess
in
support
of
this
declaration
she
finding
her
voice
madame
carré
acknowledged
she
finding
a
friend
rooth
threw
in
and
do
forget
when
you
come
to
london
my
hope
that
you
come
and
see
nick
dormer
said
to
the
girl
to
try
and
paint
you
that
would
do
me
good
she
finding
even
two
said
madame
carré
it
to
make
up
for
one
i
lost
and
miriam
looked
with
very
good
at
gabriel
nash
it
he
who
thinks
i
bad
you
say
that
to
make
me
drive
you
home
you
know
it
will
nash
returned
we
all
take
you
home
why
not
sherringham
asked
madame
carré
looked
at
the
handsome
girl
handsomer
than
ever
at
this
moment
and
at
the
three
young
men
who
had
taken
their
hats
and
stood
ready
to
accompany
her
a
deeper
expression
came
for
an
instant
into
her
hard
bright
eyes
la
she
sighed
you
always
have
that
my
child
if
you
were
the
greatest
goose
on
earth
viii
at
peter
sherringham
the
next
day
miriam
had
so
evidently
come
with
the
expectation
of
saying
something
that
it
was
impossible
such
a
patron
of
the
drama
should
forbear
to
invite
her
little
as
the
exhibition
at
madame
carré
could
have
contributed
to
render
the
invitation
prompt
his
curiosity
had
been
more
appeased
than
stimulated
but
he
felt
none
the
less
that
he
had
taken
up
the
girl
and
her
reminiscential
mother
and
must
face
the
immediate
consequences
of
the
act
this
responsibility
weighed
upon
him
during
the
hours
that
followed
the
ultimate
dispersal
of
the
little
party
at
the
door
of
the
hôtel
de
la
garonne
on
quitting
madame
carré
the
two
ladies
had
definitely
declined
nash
offered
cab
and
had
taken
their
way
homeward
on
foot
and
with
the
gentlemen
in
attendance
the
streets
of
paris
at
that
hour
were
bright
and
episodical
and
sherringham
trod
them
enough
and
not
too
fast
leaning
a
little
to
talk
with
miriam
as
he
went
their
pace
was
regulated
by
her
mother
who
advanced
on
the
arm
of
gabriel
nash
nick
dormer
was
on
her
other
side
in
refined
deprecation
her
sloping
back
was
before
them
exempt
from
retentive
stillness
in
spite
of
her
rigid
principles
with
the
little
drama
of
her
lost
and
recovered
shawl
perpetually
going
on
sherringham
said
nothing
to
the
girl
about
her
performance
or
her
powers
their
talk
was
only
of
her
manner
of
life
with
her
mother
their
travels
their
their
economies
their
want
of
a
home
the
many
cities
she
knew
well
the
foreign
tongues
and
the
wide
view
of
the
world
she
had
acquired
he
guessed
easily
enough
the
dolorous
type
of
exile
of
the
two
ladies
wanderers
in
search
of
continental
cheapness
inured
to
queer
contacts
and
compromises
remarkably
well
connected
in
england
but
going
out
for
their
meals
the
girl
was
but
indirectly
communicative
though
seemingly
less
from
any
plan
of
secrecy
than
from
the
habit
of
associating
with
people
whom
she
did
honour
with
her
confidence
she
was
fragmentary
and
abrupt
as
well
as
not
in
the
least
shy
subdued
to
dread
of
madame
carré
as
she
had
been
for
the
time
she
gave
sherringham
a
reason
for
this
fear
and
he
thought
her
reason
innocently
pretentious
she
admired
a
great
artist
more
than
anything
in
the
world
and
in
the
presence
of
art
of
art
her
heart
beat
so
fast
her
manners
were
not
perfect
and
the
friction
of
a
varied
experience
had
rather
roughened
than
smoothed
her
she
said
nothing
that
proved
her
intelligent
even
though
he
guessed
this
to
be
the
design
of
two
or
three
of
her
remarks
but
he
parted
from
her
with
the
suspicion
that
she
was
according
to
the
contemporary
french
phrase
a
nature
the
hôtel
de
la
garonne
was
in
a
small
unrenovated
street
in
which
the
of
old
paris
still
flourished
lying
between
the
avenue
de
and
the
place
de
la
bourse
sherringham
had
occasionally
traversed
the
high
dimness
but
had
never
noticed
the
tall
stale
the
aspect
of
which
that
of
a
provincial
inn
was
an
illustration
of
rooth
shrunken
standard
we
would
ask
you
to
come
up
but
it
quite
at
the
top
and
we
have
a
the
poor
lady
bravely
explained
we
had
to
receive
nash
at
a
café
nick
dormer
declared
that
he
liked
cafés
and
miriam
looking
at
his
cousin
dropped
with
a
flash
of
passion
the
demand
do
you
wonder
i
should
want
to
do
something
so
that
we
can
stop
living
like
pigs
peter
recognised
the
next
day
that
though
it
might
be
boring
to
listen
to
her
it
was
better
to
make
her
recite
than
to
let
her
do
nothing
so
effectually
did
the
presence
of
his
sister
and
that
of
lady
agnes
and
even
of
grace
and
biddy
appear
by
a
strange
tacit
opposition
to
deprive
hers
ornamental
as
it
was
of
a
reason
he
had
only
to
see
them
all
together
to
perceive
that
she
could
pass
for
having
come
to
meet
them
even
her
mother
insinuating
gentility
failed
to
put
the
occasion
on
that
footing
and
that
she
must
therefore
be
assumed
to
have
been
brought
to
show
them
something
she
was
not
subdued
not
colourless
enough
to
sit
there
for
nothing
or
even
for
conversation
the
sort
of
conversation
that
was
likely
to
come
off
so
that
it
was
inevitable
to
treat
her
position
as
connected
with
the
principal
place
on
the
carpet
with
silence
and
attention
and
the
pulling
together
of
chairs
even
when
so
established
it
struck
him
at
first
as
precarious
in
the
light
or
the
darkness
of
the
inexpressive
faces
of
the
other
ladies
seated
in
couples
and
rows
on
sofas
there
were
several
in
addition
to
julia
and
the
dormers
mainly
the
wives
with
their
husbands
of
scarcely
one
of
whom
he
felt
he
might
count
upon
for
a
modicum
of
gush
when
the
girl
should
have
finished
miss
rooth
gave
a
representation
of
juliet
drinking
the
potion
according
to
the
system
as
her
mother
explained
of
the
famous
signor
ruggieri
a
scene
of
high
fierce
sound
of
many
cries
and
contortions
she
shook
her
hair
which
proved
magnificent
before
the
performance
was
over
then
she
declaimed
several
short
poems
by
victor
hugo
selected
among
many
hundred
by
rooth
as
the
good
lady
was
careful
to
make
known
after
this
she
jumped
to
the
american
lyre
regaling
the
company
with
specimens
both
familiar
and
fresh
of
longfellow
lowell
whittier
holmes
and
of
two
or
three
poetesses
now
revealed
to
sherringham
for
the
first
time
she
flowed
so
copiously
keeping
the
floor
and
rejoicing
visibly
in
her
luck
that
her
host
was
mainly
occupied
with
wondering
how
he
could
make
her
leave
off
he
was
surprised
at
the
extent
of
her
repertory
which
in
view
of
the
circumstance
that
she
could
never
have
received
much
encouragement
it
must
have
come
mainly
from
her
mother
and
he
did
believe
in
signor
ruggieri
denoted
a
very
stiff
ambition
and
a
blundering
energy
it
was
her
mother
who
checked
her
at
last
and
he
found
himself
suspecting
that
gabriel
nash
had
intimated
to
the
old
woman
that
interference
was
necessary
for
himself
he
was
chiefly
glad
madame
carré
had
come
it
was
present
to
him
that
she
would
have
judged
the
exhibition
with
its
badness
its
impudence
the
absence
of
criticism
wholly
indecent
his
only
new
impression
of
the
heroine
of
the
scene
was
that
of
this
same
high
assurance
her
coolness
her
complacency
her
eagerness
to
go
on
she
had
been
deadly
afraid
of
the
old
actress
but
was
not
a
bit
afraid
of
a
cluster
of
du
of
julia
of
lady
agnes
of
the
smart
women
of
the
embassy
it
was
positively
these
personages
who
were
rather
in
fear
there
was
certainly
a
moment
when
even
julia
was
scared
for
the
first
time
he
had
ever
remarked
it
the
space
was
too
small
the
cries
the
convulsions
and
rushes
of
the
dishevelled
girl
were
too
near
lady
agnes
wore
much
of
the
time
the
countenance
she
might
have
shown
at
the
theatre
during
a
play
in
which
pistols
were
fired
and
indeed
the
manner
of
the
young
reciter
had
become
more
spasmodic
and
more
explosive
it
appeared
however
that
the
company
in
general
thought
her
very
clever
and
successful
which
showed
to
sherringham
sense
how
little
they
understood
the
matter
poor
biddy
was
immensely
struck
she
grew
flushed
and
absorbed
in
proportion
as
miriam
at
her
best
moments
became
pale
and
fatal
it
was
she
who
spoke
to
her
first
after
it
was
agreed
that
they
had
better
not
fatigue
her
any
more
she
advanced
a
few
steps
happening
to
be
nearest
she
murmured
oh
thank
you
so
much
i
never
saw
anything
so
beautiful
so
grand
she
looked
very
red
and
very
pretty
as
she
said
this
and
peter
sherringham
liked
her
enough
to
notice
her
more
and
like
her
better
when
she
looked
prettier
than
usual
as
he
turned
away
he
heard
miriam
make
answer
with
no
great
air
of
appreciation
of
her
tribute
i
seen
you
before
two
days
ago
at
the
salon
with
dormer
yes
i
know
he
your
brother
i
made
his
acquaintance
since
he
wants
to
paint
my
portrait
do
you
think
he
do
it
well
he
was
afraid
the
girl
was
something
of
a
brute
also
somewhat
grossly
vain
this
impression
would
perhaps
have
been
confirmed
if
a
part
of
the
rest
of
the
short
conversation
of
the
two
young
women
had
reached
his
ear
biddy
ventured
to
observe
that
she
herself
had
studied
modelling
a
little
and
that
she
could
understand
how
any
artist
would
think
miss
rooth
a
splendid
subject
if
indeed
could
attempt
her
head
that
would
be
a
chance
indeed
thank
you
said
miriam
with
a
laugh
as
of
high
comedy
i
think
i
had
rather
not
par
toute
la
then
she
added
if
your
brother
an
artist
i
do
understand
how
he
in
parliament
oh
he
is
in
parliament
now
we
only
hope
he
will
be
ah
i
see
and
he
is
an
artist
either
biddy
felt
herself
conscientiously
bound
to
state
then
he
is
anything
said
miss
rooth
well
he
immensely
clever
ah
i
see
miss
rooth
again
replied
nash
has
puffed
him
up
so
i
do
know
nash
said
biddy
guilty
of
a
little
dryness
as
well
as
of
a
little
misrepresentation
and
feeling
rather
snubbed
well
you
need
wish
to
biddy
stood
with
her
a
moment
longer
still
looking
at
her
and
not
knowing
what
to
say
next
but
not
finding
her
any
less
handsome
because
she
had
such
odd
manners
biddy
had
an
ingenious
little
mind
which
always
tried
as
much
as
possible
to
keep
different
things
separate
it
was
pervaded
now
by
the
reflexion
attended
with
some
relief
that
if
the
girl
spoke
to
her
with
such
unexpected
familiarity
of
nick
she
said
nothing
at
all
about
peter
two
gentlemen
came
up
two
of
friends
and
made
speeches
to
miss
rooth
of
the
kind
biddy
supposed
people
learned
to
make
in
paris
it
was
also
doubtless
in
paris
the
girl
privately
reasoned
that
they
learned
to
listen
to
them
as
this
striking
performer
listened
she
received
their
advances
very
differently
from
the
way
she
had
received
biddy
sherringham
noticed
his
young
kinswoman
turn
away
still
very
red
to
go
and
sit
near
her
mother
again
leaving
miriam
engaged
with
the
two
men
it
appeared
to
have
come
over
her
that
for
a
moment
she
had
been
strangely
spontaneous
and
bold
and
that
she
had
paid
a
little
of
the
penalty
the
seat
next
her
mother
was
occupied
by
rooth
toward
whom
lady
agnes
head
had
inclined
itself
with
a
preoccupied
tolerance
he
had
the
conviction
rooth
was
telling
her
about
the
of
castle
nugent
and
that
lady
agnes
was
thinking
it
odd
she
never
had
heard
of
them
he
said
to
himself
that
biddy
was
generous
she
had
urged
julia
to
come
in
order
that
they
might
see
how
bad
the
strange
young
woman
would
be
but
now
that
the
event
had
proved
dazzling
she
forgot
this
calculation
and
rejoiced
in
what
she
innocently
supposed
to
be
the
performer
triumph
she
kept
away
from
julia
however
she
did
even
look
at
her
to
invite
her
also
to
confess
that
in
vulgar
parlance
they
had
been
sold
he
himself
spoke
to
his
sister
who
was
leaning
back
with
a
detached
air
in
the
corner
of
a
sofa
saying
something
which
led
her
to
remark
in
reply
ah
i
daresay
it
extremely
fine
but
i
do
care
for
tragedy
when
it
treads
on
one
toes
she
like
a
cow
who
has
kicked
over
the
she
ought
to
be
tied
up
my
poor
julia
it
is
extremely
fine
it
is
fine
at
all
sherringham
returned
with
some
irritation
pardon
me
then
i
thought
that
was
why
you
invited
us
i
imagined
she
was
different
peter
said
a
little
foolishly
ah
if
you
do
care
for
her
so
much
the
better
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
you
make
too
awfully
much
of
those
people
oh
i
do
care
for
her
too
rather
she
interesting
his
sister
gave
him
a
momentary
mystified
glance
and
he
added
and
she
dreadful
he
felt
stupidly
annoyed
and
was
ashamed
of
his
annoyance
as
he
could
have
assigned
no
reason
for
it
it
did
grow
less
for
the
moment
from
his
seeing
gabriel
nash
approach
julia
introduced
by
nick
dormer
he
gave
place
to
the
two
young
men
with
some
alacrity
for
he
had
a
sense
of
being
put
in
the
wrong
in
respect
to
their
specimen
by
nash
very
presence
he
remembered
how
it
had
been
a
part
of
their
bargain
as
it
were
that
he
should
present
that
gentleman
to
his
sister
he
was
not
sorry
to
be
relieved
of
the
office
by
nick
and
he
even
tacitly
and
ironically
wished
his
kinsman
friend
joy
of
a
colloquy
with
dallow
sherringham
life
was
spent
with
people
he
was
used
to
people
and
both
as
host
and
as
guest
he
carried
the
social
burden
in
general
lightly
he
could
observe
especially
in
the
former
capacity
without
uneasiness
and
take
the
temperature
without
anxiety
but
at
present
his
company
oppressed
him
he
felt
worried
and
that
he
showed
it
which
was
the
thing
in
the
world
he
had
ever
held
least
an
honour
to
a
gentleman
dedicated
to
diplomacy
he
was
vexed
with
the
levity
that
had
made
him
call
his
roomful
together
on
so
poor
a
pretext
and
yet
was
vexed
with
the
stupidity
that
made
the
witnesses
so
evidently
find
the
pretext
sufficient
he
inwardly
groaned
at
the
delusion
under
which
he
had
saddled
himself
with
the
tragic
muse
a
tragic
muse
who
was
strident
and
pert
and
yet
wished
his
visitors
would
go
away
and
leave
him
alone
with
her
nick
dormer
said
to
dallow
that
he
wanted
her
to
know
an
old
friend
of
his
one
of
the
cleverest
men
he
knew
and
he
added
the
hope
that
she
would
be
gentle
and
encouraging
with
him
he
was
so
timid
and
so
easily
disconcerted
nash
hereupon
dropped
into
a
chair
by
the
arm
of
her
sofa
their
companion
went
away
and
dallow
turned
her
glance
upon
her
new
acquaintance
without
a
perceptible
change
of
position
then
she
emitted
with
rapidity
the
remark
it
very
awkward
when
people
are
told
one
clever
it
only
awkward
if
one
is
gabriel
smiled
yes
but
so
few
people
are
enough
to
be
talked
about
is
that
just
the
reason
why
such
a
matter
such
an
exception
ought
to
be
mentioned
to
them
he
asked
they
might
find
it
out
for
themselves
of
course
however
as
you
say
there
ought
to
be
a
certainty
then
they
surer
to
know
it
dormer
a
dear
fellow
but
he
rash
and
superficial
dallow
at
this
incitement
turned
her
glance
a
second
time
on
her
visitor
but
during
the
rest
of
the
conversation
she
rarely
repeated
the
movement
if
she
liked
nick
dormer
extremely
and
it
may
without
more
delay
be
communicated
to
the
reader
that
she
did
her
liking
was
of
a
kind
that
opposed
no
difficulty
whatever
to
her
not
liking
in
case
of
such
a
complication
a
person
attached
or
otherwise
belonging
to
him
it
was
not
in
her
nature
to
put
up
with
others
for
the
sake
of
an
individual
she
loved
the
putting
up
was
usually
consumed
in
the
loving
and
with
nothing
left
over
if
the
affection
that
isolates
and
simplifies
its
object
may
be
distinguished
from
the
affection
that
seeks
communications
and
contracts
for
it
julia
dallow
was
quite
of
the
encircling
not
to
say
the
narrowing
sort
she
was
not
so
much
jealous
as
essentially
exclusive
she
desired
no
experience
for
the
familiar
and
yet
partly
unsounded
kinsman
in
whom
she
took
an
interest
that
she
would
have
desired
for
herself
and
indeed
the
cause
of
her
interest
in
him
was
partly
the
vision
of
his
helping
her
to
the
particular
extensions
she
did
desire
the
taste
and
thrill
of
great
affairs
and
of
public
action
to
have
such
ambitions
for
him
appeared
to
her
the
highest
honour
she
could
do
him
her
conscience
was
in
it
as
well
as
her
inclination
and
her
scheme
to
her
sense
was
noble
enough
to
varnish
over
any
disdain
she
might
feel
for
forces
drawing
him
another
way
she
had
a
prejudice
in
general
against
his
existing
connexions
a
suspicion
of
them
and
a
supply
of
contempt
in
waiting
it
was
a
singular
circumstance
that
she
was
sceptical
even
when
knowing
her
as
well
as
he
did
he
thought
them
worth
recommending
to
her
the
recommendation
indeed
mostly
confirmed
the
suspicion
this
was
a
law
from
which
gabriel
nash
was
condemned
to
suffer
if
suffering
could
on
any
occasion
be
predicated
of
gabriel
nash
his
pretension
was
in
truth
that
he
had
purged
his
life
of
such
possibilities
of
waste
though
probably
he
would
have
admitted
that
if
that
fair
vessel
should
spring
a
leak
the
wound
in
its
side
would
have
been
dealt
by
a
woman
hand
in
dining
two
evenings
before
with
her
brother
and
with
the
dormers
dallow
had
been
moved
to
exclaim
that
peter
and
nick
knew
the
most
extraordinary
people
as
regards
peter
the
attitudinising
girl
and
her
mother
now
pointed
that
moral
with
sufficient
vividness
so
that
there
was
little
arrogance
in
taking
a
similar
quality
for
granted
of
the
conceited
man
at
her
elbow
who
sat
there
as
if
he
might
be
capable
from
one
moment
to
another
of
leaning
over
the
arm
of
her
sofa
she
had
not
the
slightest
wish
to
talk
with
him
about
himself
and
was
afraid
for
an
instant
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
passing
from
the
chapter
of
his
cleverness
to
that
of
his
timidity
it
was
a
false
alarm
however
for
he
only
animadverted
on
the
pleasures
of
the
elegant
extract
hurled
literally
in
general
from
the
centre
of
the
room
at
one
defenceless
head
he
intimated
that
in
his
opinion
these
pleasures
were
all
for
the
performers
the
auditors
had
at
any
rate
given
miss
rooth
a
charming
afternoon
that
of
course
was
what
dallow
kind
brother
had
mainly
intended
in
arranging
the
little
party
julia
hated
to
hear
him
call
her
brother
kind
the
term
seemed
offensively
patronising
but
he
himself
he
related
was
now
constantly
employed
in
the
same
beneficence
listening
of
his
time
to
intonations
and
shrieks
she
had
doubtless
observed
it
herself
how
the
great
current
of
the
age
the
adoration
of
the
mime
was
almost
too
strong
for
any
individual
how
it
swept
one
along
and
dashed
one
against
the
rocks
as
she
made
no
response
to
this
proposition
gabriel
nash
asked
her
if
she
had
been
struck
with
the
main
sign
of
the
time
the
preponderance
of
the
mountebank
the
glory
and
renown
the
personal
favour
he
enjoyed
had
she
noticed
what
an
immense
part
of
the
public
attention
he
held
in
london
at
least
for
in
paris
society
was
not
so
pervaded
with
him
and
the
women
of
the
profession
in
particular
were
not
in
every
i
do
know
what
you
mean
dallow
said
i
know
nothing
of
any
such
people
are
they
under
your
feet
wherever
you
turn
their
performances
their
portraits
their
speeches
their
autobiographies
their
names
their
manners
their
ugly
mugs
as
the
people
say
and
their
idiotic
pretensions
i
daresay
it
depends
on
the
places
one
goes
to
if
everywhere
and
she
paused
a
moment
i
do
go
everywhere
i
do
go
anywhere
but
they
mount
on
my
back
at
home
like
the
old
man
of
the
sea
just
observe
a
little
when
you
return
to
london
nash
went
on
with
friendly
instructiveness
julia
got
up
at
this
she
like
receiving
directions
but
no
other
corner
of
the
room
appeared
to
offer
her
any
particular
reason
for
crossing
to
it
she
never
did
such
a
thing
without
a
great
inducement
so
she
remained
standing
there
as
if
she
were
quitting
the
place
in
a
moment
which
indeed
she
now
determined
to
do
and
her
interlocutor
rising
also
lingered
beside
her
unencouraged
but
unperturbed
he
proceeded
to
remark
that
sherringham
was
quite
right
to
offer
miss
rooth
an
afternoon
sport
she
deserved
it
as
a
fine
brave
amiable
girl
she
was
highly
educated
knew
a
dozen
languages
was
of
illustrious
lineage
and
was
immensely
particular
immensely
particular
dallow
repeated
perhaps
i
should
say
rather
that
her
mother
so
on
her
behalf
particular
about
the
sort
of
people
they
meet
the
tone
the
standard
i
bound
to
say
they
like
they
do
go
everywhere
that
spirit
not
so
common
in
the
mob
calling
itself
good
society
as
not
to
deserve
mention
she
said
nothing
for
a
moment
she
looked
vaguely
round
the
room
but
not
at
miriam
rooth
nevertheless
she
presently
dropped
as
in
forced
reference
to
her
an
impatient
shake
she
dreadfully
vulgar
ah
do
say
that
to
my
friend
dormer
nash
laughed
are
you
and
he
such
great
friends
dallow
asked
meeting
his
eyes
great
enough
to
make
me
hope
we
shall
be
greater
again
for
a
little
she
said
nothing
but
then
went
on
why
should
i
say
to
him
that
she
vulgar
because
he
admires
her
so
much
he
wants
to
paint
her
to
paint
her
to
paint
her
portrait
oh
i
see
i
daresay
she
do
for
that
nash
showed
further
amusement
if
that
your
opinion
of
her
not
very
complimentary
to
the
art
he
aspires
to
practise
he
aspires
to
practise
she
echoed
afresh
have
you
talked
with
him
about
it
ah
you
must
keep
him
up
to
it
julia
dallow
was
conscious
for
a
moment
of
looking
uncomfortable
but
it
relieved
her
to
be
able
to
demand
of
her
neighbour
with
a
certain
manner
are
you
an
artist
i
try
to
be
nash
smiled
but
i
work
in
such
difficult
material
he
spoke
this
with
such
a
clever
suggestion
of
mysterious
things
that
she
was
to
hear
herself
once
more
pay
him
the
attention
of
taking
him
up
difficult
material
i
work
in
life
at
this
she
turned
away
leaving
him
the
impression
that
she
probably
misunderstood
his
speech
thinking
he
meant
that
he
drew
from
the
living
model
or
some
such
platitude
as
if
there
could
have
been
any
likelihood
he
would
have
dealings
with
the
dead
this
indeed
would
not
fully
have
explained
the
abruptness
with
which
she
dropped
their
conversation
gabriel
however
was
used
to
sudden
collapses
and
even
to
sudden
ruptures
on
the
part
of
those
addressed
by
him
and
no
man
had
more
the
secret
of
remaining
gracefully
with
his
conversational
wares
on
his
hands
he
saw
dallow
approach
nick
dormer
who
was
talking
with
one
of
the
ladies
of
the
embassy
and
apparently
signify
that
she
wished
to
speak
to
him
he
got
up
and
they
had
a
minute
talk
after
which
he
turned
and
took
leave
of
his
she
said
a
word
to
her
brother
nick
joined
her
and
they
then
came
together
to
the
door
in
this
movement
they
had
to
pass
near
nash
and
it
gave
her
an
opportunity
to
nod
to
him
which
he
was
by
no
means
sure
she
would
have
done
if
nick
had
been
with
her
the
young
man
just
stopped
he
said
to
nash
i
should
like
to
see
you
this
evening
late
you
must
meet
me
somewhere
well
take
a
walk
i
should
like
that
nash
replied
i
shall
smoke
a
cigar
at
the
café
on
the
corner
of
the
place
de
you
find
me
there
he
prepared
to
compass
his
own
departure
but
before
doing
so
he
addressed
himself
to
the
duty
of
a
few
civil
words
to
lady
agnes
this
effort
proved
vain
for
on
one
side
she
was
defended
by
the
wall
of
the
room
and
on
the
other
rendered
inaccessible
by
miriam
mother
who
clung
to
her
with
a
fidelity
showing
no
symptom
of
desistance
nash
declined
perforce
upon
her
daughter
grace
who
said
to
him
you
were
talking
with
my
cousin
mrs
dallow
to
her
rather
than
with
her
he
smiled
ah
she
very
charming
grace
said
she
very
beautiful
and
very
clever
the
girl
continued
very
very
intelligent
his
conversation
with
miss
dormer
went
little
beyond
this
and
he
presently
took
leave
of
peter
sherringham
remarking
to
him
as
they
shook
hands
that
he
was
very
sorry
for
him
but
he
had
courted
his
fate
what
do
you
mean
by
my
fate
sherringham
asked
you
got
them
for
life
why
for
life
when
i
now
clearly
and
courageously
recognise
that
she
is
good
ah
but
she
become
so
said
gabriel
nash
do
you
think
that
sherringham
brought
out
with
a
candour
that
made
his
visitor
laugh
will
that
more
to
the
purpose
the
latter
declared
as
he
went
away
ten
minutes
later
lady
agnes
substituted
a
general
vague
assent
for
all
further
particular
ones
drawing
off
from
rooth
and
from
the
rest
of
the
company
with
her
daughters
peter
had
had
very
little
talk
with
biddy
but
the
girl
kept
her
disappointment
out
of
her
pretty
eyes
and
said
to
him
you
told
us
she
did
know
how
but
she
does
there
was
no
suggestion
of
disappointment
in
this
sherringham
held
her
hand
a
moment
ah
it
you
who
know
how
dear
biddy
he
answered
and
he
was
conscious
that
if
the
occasion
had
been
more
private
he
would
have
all
lawfully
kissed
her
presently
three
more
of
his
guests
took
leave
and
nash
assurance
that
he
had
them
for
life
recurred
to
him
as
he
observed
that
rooth
and
her
damsel
quite
failed
to
profit
by
so
many
examples
the
lovicks
remained
a
colleague
and
his
sociable
wife
and
peter
gave
them
a
hint
that
they
were
not
to
plant
him
there
only
with
the
two
ladies
miriam
quitted
lovick
who
had
attempted
with
no
great
subtlety
to
engage
her
and
came
up
to
her
host
as
if
she
suspected
him
of
a
design
of
stealing
from
the
room
and
had
the
idea
of
preventing
it
i
want
some
more
tea
will
you
give
me
some
more
i
feel
quite
faint
you
do
seem
to
suspect
how
this
sort
of
thing
takes
it
out
of
one
peter
apologised
extravagantly
for
not
having
seen
to
it
that
she
had
proper
refreshment
and
took
her
to
the
round
table
in
a
corner
on
which
the
little
collation
had
been
served
he
poured
out
tea
for
her
and
pressed
bread
and
butter
on
her
and
of
all
which
she
profusely
and
methodically
partook
it
was
late
the
afternoon
had
faded
and
a
lamp
been
brought
in
the
wide
shade
of
which
shed
a
fair
glow
on
the
and
the
plates
of
pretty
food
the
lovicks
sat
with
rooth
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
the
girl
stood
at
the
table
drinking
her
tea
and
eating
her
bread
and
butter
she
consumed
these
articles
so
freely
that
he
wondered
if
she
had
been
truly
in
want
of
a
meal
if
they
were
so
poor
as
to
have
to
count
with
that
sort
of
privation
this
supposition
was
softening
but
still
not
so
much
so
as
to
make
him
ask
her
to
sit
down
she
appeared
indeed
to
prefer
to
stand
she
looked
better
so
as
if
the
freedom
the
conspicuity
of
being
on
her
feet
and
treading
a
stage
were
agreeable
to
her
while
sherringham
lingered
near
her
all
vaguely
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
mind
now
void
of
everything
but
a
planned
evasion
of
the
theatrical
question
there
were
moments
when
he
was
so
plentifully
tired
of
it
she
broke
out
abruptly
confess
you
think
me
intolerably
bad
intolerably
no
only
tolerably
i
find
that
worse
every
now
and
then
you
do
something
very
right
sherringham
said
how
many
such
things
did
i
do
oh
three
or
four
i
do
know
that
i
counted
very
carefully
she
raised
her
cup
to
her
lips
looking
at
him
over
the
rim
of
it
a
proceeding
that
gave
her
eyes
a
strange
expression
it
bores
you
and
you
think
it
disagreeable
she
then
said
i
mean
a
girl
always
talking
about
herself
he
protested
she
could
never
bore
him
and
she
added
oh
i
do
want
compliments
i
want
the
hard
the
precious
truth
an
actress
has
to
talk
about
herself
what
else
can
she
talk
about
poor
vain
thing
she
can
talk
sometimes
about
other
actresses
that
comes
to
the
same
thing
you
wo
be
serious
i
awfully
serious
there
was
something
that
caught
his
attention
in
the
note
of
this
a
longing
half
hopeless
half
argumentative
to
be
believed
in
if
one
really
wants
to
do
anything
one
must
worry
it
out
of
course
everything
does
come
the
first
day
she
kept
on
i
ca
see
everything
at
once
but
i
can
see
a
little
more
step
by
step
as
i
go
ca
i
that
the
way
that
the
way
he
gently
enough
returned
when
you
see
the
things
to
do
the
art
of
doing
them
will
come
if
you
hammer
away
the
great
point
to
see
them
yes
and
you
do
think
me
clever
enough
for
that
why
do
you
say
so
when
i
asked
you
to
come
here
on
purpose
you
asked
me
to
come
but
i
had
no
success
on
the
contrary
every
one
thought
you
wonderful
oh
but
they
do
know
said
miriam
rooth
you
not
said
a
word
to
me
i
do
mind
your
not
having
praised
me
that
would
be
too
banal
but
if
i
bad
and
i
know
i
dreadful
i
wish
you
talk
to
me
about
it
it
delightful
to
talk
to
you
peter
found
himself
saying
no
it
is
but
it
kind
and
she
looked
away
from
him
her
voice
had
with
this
a
quality
which
made
him
exclaim
every
now
and
then
you
something
she
turned
her
eyes
back
to
him
and
her
face
had
a
light
i
do
want
it
to
come
by
accident
then
she
added
if
there
any
good
to
be
got
from
trying
from
showing
one
self
how
can
it
come
unless
one
hears
the
simple
truth
the
truth
that
turns
one
inside
out
it
all
for
that
to
know
what
one
is
if
one
a
stick
you
great
courage
you
rare
qualities
sherringham
risked
she
had
begun
to
touch
him
to
seem
different
he
was
glad
she
had
not
gone
but
for
a
little
she
made
no
answer
putting
down
her
empty
cup
and
yearning
over
the
table
as
for
something
more
to
eat
suddenly
she
raised
her
head
and
broke
out
with
vehemence
i
will
i
will
i
will
you
do
what
you
want
evidently
i
succeed
i
be
great
of
course
i
know
too
little
seen
too
little
but
i
always
liked
it
i
never
liked
anything
else
i
used
to
learn
things
and
do
scenes
and
rant
about
the
room
when
i
was
but
five
years
old
she
went
on
communicative
persuasive
familiar
egotistical
as
was
necessary
and
slightly
common
or
perhaps
only
natural
with
reminiscences
reasons
and
anecdotes
an
unexpected
profusion
and
with
an
air
of
comradeship
of
freedom
in
any
relation
which
seemed
to
plead
that
she
was
capable
at
least
of
embracing
that
side
of
the
profession
she
desired
to
adopt
he
noted
that
if
she
had
seen
very
little
as
she
said
she
had
also
seen
a
great
deal
but
both
her
experience
and
her
innocence
had
been
accidental
and
irregular
she
had
seen
very
little
acting
the
theatre
was
always
too
expensive
if
she
could
only
go
often
in
paris
for
instance
every
night
for
six
months
to
see
the
best
the
worst
everything
she
would
make
things
out
would
observe
and
learn
what
to
do
what
not
to
do
it
would
be
a
school
of
schools
but
she
could
without
selling
the
clothes
off
her
back
it
was
vile
and
disgusting
to
be
poor
and
if
ever
she
were
to
know
the
bliss
of
having
a
few
francs
in
her
pocket
she
would
make
up
for
it
that
she
could
promise
she
had
never
been
acquainted
with
any
one
who
could
tell
her
anything
if
it
was
good
or
bad
or
right
or
wrong
except
delamere
and
poor
ruggieri
she
supposed
they
had
told
her
a
great
deal
but
perhaps
they
had
and
she
was
perfectly
willing
to
give
it
up
if
it
was
bad
evidently
madame
carré
thought
so
she
thought
it
was
horrid
was
it
perfectly
divine
the
way
the
old
woman
had
said
those
verses
those
speeches
of
célie
if
she
would
only
let
her
come
and
listen
to
her
once
in
a
while
like
that
it
was
all
she
would
ask
she
had
got
lots
of
ideas
just
from
that
she
had
practised
them
over
over
and
over
again
the
moment
she
got
home
he
might
ask
her
mother
he
might
ask
the
people
next
door
if
madame
carré
did
think
she
could
work
she
might
have
heard
could
she
have
listened
at
the
door
something
that
would
show
her
but
she
think
her
even
good
enough
to
criticise
since
that
was
criticism
telling
her
her
head
was
good
of
course
her
head
was
good
she
travel
up
to
the
to
find
that
out
it
was
her
mother
the
way
she
talked
who
gave
the
idea
that
she
wanted
to
be
elegant
and
moral
and
a
du
and
all
that
sort
of
trash
of
course
that
put
people
off
when
they
were
only
thinking
of
the
real
right
way
did
she
know
miriam
herself
that
this
was
the
one
thing
to
think
of
but
any
one
would
be
kind
to
her
mother
who
knew
what
a
dear
she
was
she
does
know
when
any
thing
right
or
wrong
but
she
a
perfect
saint
said
the
girl
obscuring
considerably
her
vindication
she
does
mind
when
i
say
things
over
by
the
hour
dinning
them
into
her
ears
while
she
sits
there
and
reads
she
a
tremendous
reader
she
awfully
up
in
literature
she
taught
me
everything
herself
i
mean
all
that
sort
of
thing
of
course
i
not
so
fond
of
reading
i
go
in
for
the
book
of
life
sherringham
wondered
if
her
mother
had
not
at
any
rate
taught
her
that
phrase
he
thought
it
highly
probable
it
would
give
on
nerves
the
life
i
lead
her
miriam
continued
but
she
really
a
delicious
woman
the
oddity
of
this
epithet
made
peter
laugh
and
altogether
in
a
few
minutes
which
is
perhaps
a
sign
that
he
abused
his
right
to
be
a
man
of
moods
the
young
lady
had
produced
in
him
a
revolution
of
curiosity
set
his
sympathy
in
motion
her
mixture
as
it
spread
itself
before
him
was
an
appeal
and
a
challenge
she
was
sensitive
and
dense
she
was
underbred
and
fine
certainly
she
was
very
various
and
that
was
rare
quite
not
at
this
moment
the
frightened
creature
who
had
pulled
herself
together
with
such
an
effort
at
madame
carré
nor
the
elated
phenomenon
who
had
just
been
declaiming
nor
the
rather
affected
and
contradictious
young
person
with
whom
he
had
walked
home
from
the
rue
de
constantinople
was
this
succession
of
phases
a
sign
she
was
really
a
case
of
the
celebrated
artistic
temperament
the
nature
that
made
people
provoking
and
interesting
that
sherringham
himself
was
of
this
shifting
complexion
is
perhaps
proved
by
his
odd
capacity
for
being
of
two
different
minds
very
nearly
at
the
same
time
miriam
was
pretty
now
with
felicities
and
graces
with
charming
unusual
eyes
yes
there
were
things
he
could
do
for
her
he
had
already
forgotten
the
chill
of
nash
irony
of
his
prophecy
he
was
even
scarce
conscious
how
little
in
general
he
liked
hints
insinuations
favours
asked
obliquely
and
plaintively
that
was
doubtless
also
because
the
girl
was
suddenly
so
taking
and
so
fraternising
perhaps
indeed
it
was
unjust
to
qualify
as
roundabout
the
manner
in
which
miss
rooth
conveyed
that
it
was
open
to
him
not
only
to
pay
for
her
lessons
but
to
meet
the
expense
of
her
nightly
attendance
with
her
mother
at
instructive
exhibitions
of
theatrical
art
it
was
a
large
order
sending
the
pair
to
all
the
plays
but
what
peter
now
found
himself
thinking
of
was
not
so
much
its
largeness
as
the
possible
interest
of
going
with
them
sometimes
and
pointing
the
moral
the
technical
one
of
showing
her
the
things
he
liked
the
things
he
disapproved
she
repeated
her
declaration
that
she
recognised
the
fallacy
of
her
mother
view
of
heroines
impossibly
virtuous
and
of
the
importance
of
her
looking
out
for
such
tremendously
proper
people
one
must
let
her
talk
but
of
course
it
creates
a
prejudice
she
said
with
her
eyes
on
and
lovick
who
had
got
up
terminating
their
communion
with
rooth
it
a
great
muddle
i
know
but
she
ca
bear
anything
coarse
or
nasty
and
quite
right
too
i
should
either
if
i
did
have
to
but
i
do
care
a
sou
where
i
go
if
i
can
get
to
act
or
who
they
are
if
they
help
me
i
want
to
act
that
what
i
want
to
do
i
do
want
to
meddle
in
affairs
i
can
look
out
for
myself
i
all
right
the
girl
exclaimed
roundly
frankly
with
a
ring
of
honesty
which
made
her
crude
and
pure
as
for
doing
the
bad
ones
i
not
afraid
of
that
the
bad
ones
the
bad
women
in
the
plays
like
madame
carré
i
do
any
vile
creature
i
think
you
do
best
what
you
are
and
sherringham
laughed
for
the
interest
of
it
you
a
strange
girl
crois
does
one
have
to
be
to
want
to
go
and
exhibit
one
self
to
a
loathsome
crowd
on
a
platform
with
trumpets
and
a
big
drum
for
money
to
parade
one
body
and
one
soul
he
looked
at
her
a
moment
her
face
changed
constantly
now
it
had
a
fine
flush
and
a
noble
delicacy
give
it
up
you
too
good
for
it
he
found
himself
pleading
i
doubt
if
you
an
idea
of
what
girls
have
to
go
through
never
never
never
till
i
pelted
she
cried
then
stay
on
here
a
bit
i
take
you
to
the
theatres
oh
you
dear
miriam
delightedly
exclaimed
and
lovick
accompanied
by
rooth
now
crossed
the
room
to
them
and
the
girl
went
on
in
the
same
tone
mamma
dear
he
the
best
friend
we
ever
had
he
a
great
deal
nicer
than
i
thought
so
are
you
mademoiselle
said
peter
sherringham
oh
i
trust
sherringham
i
trust
him
infinitely
rooth
returned
covering
him
with
her
mild
respectable
wheedling
eyes
the
kindness
of
every
one
has
been
beyond
everything
and
lovick
ca
say
enough
they
make
the
most
obliging
offers
they
want
you
to
know
their
brother
oh
i
say
he
no
brother
of
mine
lovick
protested
they
think
he
be
so
suggestive
he
put
us
up
to
the
right
things
rooth
went
on
it
just
a
little
brother
of
mine
such
a
dear
amusing
clever
boy
lovick
explained
do
you
know
she
has
got
nine
upon
my
honour
she
has
said
her
husband
this
one
is
the
sixth
fancy
if
i
had
to
take
them
all
over
yes
it
makes
it
rather
awkward
lovick
amiably
conceded
he
has
gone
on
the
stage
poor
darling
but
he
acts
rather
well
he
tried
for
the
diplomatic
service
but
he
did
precisely
dazzle
his
examiners
lovick
further
mentioned
edmund
very
nasty
about
him
there
are
lots
of
gentlemen
on
the
stage
he
not
the
first
it
such
a
comfort
to
hear
that
said
rooth
i
much
obliged
to
you
has
he
got
a
theatre
miriam
asked
my
dear
young
lady
he
has
even
got
an
engagement
replied
the
young
man
terrible
he
has
been
at
it
very
long
but
i
sure
he
get
on
immensely
in
earnest
and
very
i
just
said
that
if
he
should
come
over
to
see
us
you
might
rather
like
to
meet
him
he
might
give
you
some
tips
as
my
husband
says
i
do
care
for
his
looks
but
i
should
like
his
tips
miriam
liberally
smiled
and
is
he
coming
over
to
see
you
asked
sherringham
to
whom
while
this
exchange
of
remarks
which
he
had
not
lost
was
going
on
rooth
had
in
lowered
accents
addressed
herself
not
if
i
can
help
it
i
think
but
lovick
was
so
gaily
rude
that
it
was
embarrassing
oh
sir
i
sure
you
fond
of
him
rooth
remonstrated
as
the
party
passed
together
into
the
antechamber
no
really
i
like
some
of
the
others
four
or
five
of
them
but
i
do
like
arty
we
make
it
up
to
him
then
like
him
miriam
answered
with
spirit
and
her
voice
rang
in
the
staircase
sherringham
attended
them
a
little
way
with
a
charm
which
her
host
had
rather
missed
in
her
loudness
of
the
day
before
ix
nick
dormer
found
his
friend
nash
that
evening
at
the
place
of
their
tryst
smoking
a
cigar
in
the
warm
bright
night
on
the
terrace
of
the
café
forming
one
of
the
angles
of
the
place
de
he
sat
down
with
him
but
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
uttered
a
protest
against
the
crush
and
confusion
the
publicity
and
vulgarity
of
the
place
the
shuffling
procession
of
the
crowd
the
jostle
of
the
perpetual
brush
of
waiters
come
away
i
want
to
talk
to
you
and
i
ca
talk
here
i
do
care
where
we
go
it
will
be
pleasant
to
walk
well
stroll
away
to
the
each
time
i
come
to
paris
i
at
the
end
of
three
days
take
the
boulevard
with
its
conventional
grimace
into
greater
aversion
i
hate
even
to
cross
it
i
go
half
a
mile
round
to
avoid
it
the
young
men
took
their
course
together
down
the
rue
de
la
paix
to
the
rue
de
rivoli
which
they
crossed
passing
beside
the
gilded
rails
of
the
tuileries
the
beauty
of
the
night
the
only
defect
of
which
was
that
the
immense
illumination
of
paris
kept
it
from
being
quite
night
enough
made
it
a
sort
of
bedizened
rejuvenated
day
gave
a
charm
to
the
quieter
streets
drew
our
friends
away
to
the
right
to
the
river
and
the
bridges
the
older
duskier
city
the
pale
ghost
of
the
palace
that
had
perished
by
fire
hung
over
them
a
while
and
by
the
passage
now
open
at
all
times
across
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
they
came
out
upon
the
seine
they
kept
on
and
on
moving
slowly
smoking
talking
pausing
stopping
to
look
to
emphasise
to
compare
they
fell
into
discussion
into
confidence
into
inquiry
sympathetic
or
satiric
and
into
explanations
which
needed
in
turn
to
be
explained
the
balmy
night
the
time
for
talk
the
amusement
of
paris
the
memory
of
younger
passages
gave
a
lift
to
the
occasion
nick
had
already
forgotten
his
little
brush
with
julia
on
his
leaving
peter
at
her
side
and
that
he
had
been
almost
disconcerted
by
the
asperity
with
which
she
denounced
the
odious
man
he
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
force
upon
her
impertinent
and
fatuous
she
had
called
him
and
when
nick
began
to
plead
that
he
was
really
neither
of
these
things
though
he
could
imagine
his
manner
might
sometimes
suggest
them
she
had
declared
that
she
did
wish
to
argue
about
him
or
ever
to
hear
of
him
again
nick
had
counted
on
her
liking
gabriel
nash
but
had
thought
her
not
liking
him
would
perceptibly
matter
he
had
given
himself
the
diversion
not
cruel
surely
to
any
one
concerned
of
seeing
what
she
would
make
of
a
type
she
had
never
before
met
she
had
made
even
less
than
he
expected
and
her
intimation
that
he
had
played
her
a
trick
had
been
irritating
enough
to
prevent
his
reflecting
that
the
offence
might
have
been
in
some
degree
with
nash
but
he
had
recovered
from
his
resentment
sufficiently
to
ask
this
personage
with
every
possible
circumstance
of
implied
consideration
for
the
lady
what
had
been
the
impression
made
by
his
charming
cousin
upon
my
word
my
dear
fellow
i
do
regard
that
as
a
fair
question
gabriel
said
besides
if
you
think
dallow
charming
what
on
earth
need
it
matter
to
you
what
i
think
the
superiority
of
one
opinion
over
another
is
never
so
great
as
when
the
opinion
about
a
woman
it
was
to
help
me
to
find
out
what
i
think
of
yourself
nick
returned
oh
that
you
never
do
i
shall
bewilder
you
to
the
end
the
lady
with
whom
you
were
so
good
as
to
make
me
acquainted
is
a
beautiful
specimen
of
the
english
the
product
of
high
cultivation
and
much
tending
a
tall
delicate
stem
with
the
head
set
upon
it
in
a
manner
which
as
a
thing
seen
and
remembered
should
doubtless
count
for
us
as
a
gift
of
the
gods
she
the
perfect
type
of
the
object
or
bred
and
everything
about
her
hangs
together
and
conduces
to
the
effect
from
the
angle
of
her
elbow
to
the
way
she
drops
that
vague
conventional
dry
little
which
dispenses
with
all
further
performance
that
degree
of
completeness
is
always
satisfying
but
i
did
satisfy
her
and
she
did
understand
me
i
do
think
they
usually
understand
she
no
worse
than
i
then
ah
she
did
try
no
she
does
try
but
she
probably
thought
you
a
monster
of
conceit
and
she
would
think
so
still
more
if
she
were
to
hear
you
talk
about
her
trying
very
likely
very
likely
said
gabriel
nash
i
an
idea
a
good
many
people
think
that
it
strikes
me
as
comic
i
suppose
it
a
result
of
my
little
system
what
little
system
oh
nothing
more
wonderful
than
the
idea
of
being
just
the
same
to
every
one
people
have
so
bemuddled
themselves
that
the
last
thing
they
can
conceive
is
that
one
should
be
simple
lord
do
you
call
yourself
simple
nick
ejaculated
absolutely
in
the
sense
of
having
no
interest
of
my
own
to
push
no
nostrum
to
advertise
no
power
to
conciliate
no
axe
to
grind
i
not
a
savage
ah
far
from
it
but
i
really
think
i
perfectly
independent
well
that
always
provoking
nick
knowingly
returned
so
it
would
appear
to
the
great
majority
of
one
and
i
well
remember
the
pang
with
which
i
originally
made
that
discovery
it
darkened
my
spirit
at
a
time
when
i
had
no
thought
of
evil
what
we
like
when
we
unregenerate
is
that
a
should
give
us
a
password
come
over
to
our
side
join
our
little
camp
or
religion
get
into
our
little
boat
in
short
whatever
it
is
and
help
us
to
row
it
it
natural
enough
we
mostly
in
different
tubs
and
cockles
paddling
for
life
our
opinions
our
convictions
and
doctrines
and
standards
are
simply
the
particular
thing
that
will
make
the
boat
go
naturally
for
they
may
very
often
be
just
the
thing
that
will
sink
another
if
you
wo
get
in
people
generally
hate
you
your
metaphor
very
lame
said
nick
it
the
overcrowded
boat
that
goes
to
the
bottom
oh
i
give
it
another
leg
or
two
boats
can
be
big
in
the
infinite
of
space
and
a
doctrine
a
raft
that
floats
the
better
the
more
passengers
it
carries
a
passenger
jumps
over
from
time
to
time
not
so
much
from
fear
of
sinking
as
from
a
want
of
interest
in
the
course
or
the
company
he
swims
he
plunges
he
dives
he
dips
down
and
visits
the
fishes
and
the
mermaids
and
the
submarine
caves
he
goes
from
craft
to
craft
and
splashes
about
on
his
own
account
in
the
blue
cool
water
the
regenerate
as
i
call
them
are
the
passengers
who
jump
over
in
search
of
better
fun
i
jumped
over
long
ago
and
now
of
course
you
at
the
head
of
the
regenerate
for
in
your
turn
nick
found
the
figure
delightful
you
all
form
a
select
school
of
porpoises
not
a
bit
and
i
know
nothing
about
heads
in
the
sense
you
mean
grown
a
tail
if
you
will
i
the
merman
wandering
free
it
the
jolliest
of
trades
before
they
had
gone
many
steps
further
nick
dormer
stopped
short
with
a
question
i
say
my
dear
fellow
do
you
mind
mentioning
to
me
whether
you
the
greatest
humbug
and
charlatan
on
earth
or
a
genuine
intelligence
one
that
has
sifted
things
for
itself
i
do
lead
your
poor
british
wit
a
dance
i
so
sorry
nash
replied
benignly
but
i
very
sincere
and
i
tried
to
straighten
out
things
a
bit
for
myself
then
why
do
you
give
people
such
a
handle
such
a
handle
for
thinking
you
an
for
thinking
you
a
mere
i
daresay
it
my
manner
they
so
unused
to
any
sort
of
candour
well
then
why
do
you
try
another
nick
asked
one
has
the
manner
that
one
can
and
mine
moreover
a
part
of
my
little
system
ah
if
you
make
so
much
of
your
little
system
you
no
better
than
any
one
else
nick
returned
as
they
went
on
i
do
pretend
to
be
better
for
we
all
miserable
sinners
i
only
pretend
to
be
bad
in
a
pleasanter
brighter
way
by
what
i
can
see
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
just
take
for
granted
our
right
to
be
happy
and
brave
what
essentially
kinder
and
more
helpful
than
that
what
more
beneficent
but
the
tradition
of
dreariness
of
stodginess
of
dull
dense
literal
prose
has
so
sealed
people
eyes
that
ended
by
thinking
the
most
natural
of
all
things
the
most
perverse
why
so
keep
up
the
dreariness
in
our
poor
little
day
no
one
can
tell
me
why
and
almost
every
one
calls
me
names
for
simply
asking
the
question
but
i
go
on
for
i
believe
one
can
do
a
little
good
by
it
i
want
so
much
to
do
a
little
good
gabriel
nash
continued
taking
his
companion
arm
my
persistence
is
systematic
do
you
see
what
i
mean
i
wo
be
dreary
no
no
no
and
i
wo
recognise
the
necessity
or
even
if
there
be
any
way
out
of
it
the
accident
of
dreariness
in
the
life
that
surrounds
me
that
enough
to
make
people
stare
they
so
damned
stupid
they
think
you
so
damned
impudent
nick
freely
explained
at
this
nash
stopped
him
short
with
a
small
cry
and
turning
his
eyes
nick
saw
under
the
lamps
of
the
quay
that
he
had
brought
a
flush
of
pain
into
his
friend
face
i
do
strike
you
that
way
oh
was
it
just
admitted
that
i
do
in
the
least
make
you
out
that
the
last
thing
nash
declared
as
if
he
were
thinking
the
idea
over
with
an
air
of
genuine
distress
but
with
a
little
patience
clear
it
up
together
if
you
care
enough
about
it
he
added
more
cheerfully
letting
his
companion
proceed
again
he
continued
heaven
help
us
all
what
do
people
mean
by
impudence
there
are
many
i
think
who
do
understand
its
nature
or
its
limits
and
upon
my
word
literally
seen
mere
quickness
of
intelligence
or
of
perception
the
jump
of
a
step
or
two
a
little
whirr
of
the
wings
of
talk
mistaken
for
it
yes
i
encountered
men
and
women
who
thought
you
impudent
if
you
were
simply
so
stupid
as
they
the
only
impudence
is
unprovoked
or
even
mere
dull
aggression
and
i
indignantly
protest
that
i
never
guilty
of
clumsiness
ah
for
what
do
they
take
one
with
beastly
presumption
even
to
defend
myself
sometimes
i
to
make
believe
to
myself
that
i
care
i
always
feel
as
if
i
did
successfully
make
others
think
so
perhaps
they
see
impudence
in
that
but
i
daresay
the
offence
is
in
the
things
that
i
take
as
i
say
for
granted
for
if
one
tries
to
be
pleased
one
passes
perhaps
inevitably
for
being
pleased
above
all
with
one
self
that
really
not
my
case
i
find
my
capacity
for
pleasure
deplorably
below
the
mark
i
set
this
is
why
as
told
you
i
cultivate
it
i
try
to
bring
it
up
and
i
actuated
by
positive
benevolence
i
that
impudent
pretension
that
what
i
mean
by
being
the
same
to
every
one
by
having
only
one
manner
if
conscious
and
ingenious
to
that
end
what
the
harm
when
one
motives
are
so
pure
by
never
making
the
concession
one
may
end
by
becoming
a
perceptible
force
for
good
what
concession
are
you
talking
about
in
god
name
nick
demanded
why
that
we
here
all
for
dreariness
it
impossible
to
grant
it
sometimes
if
you
wish
to
deny
it
ever
and
what
do
you
mean
then
by
dreariness
that
modern
slang
and
terribly
vague
many
good
things
are
dreary
virtue
and
decency
and
charity
and
perseverance
and
courage
and
honour
say
at
once
that
life
dreary
my
dear
fellow
gabriel
nash
exclaimed
that
on
the
whole
my
besetting
impression
là
que
je
vous
attends
i
precisely
engaged
in
trying
what
can
be
done
in
taking
it
the
other
way
it
my
little
personal
experiment
life
consists
of
the
personal
experiments
of
each
of
us
and
the
point
of
an
experiment
is
that
it
shall
succeed
what
we
contribute
is
our
treatment
of
the
material
our
rendering
of
the
text
our
style
a
sense
of
the
qualities
of
a
style
is
so
rare
that
many
persons
should
doubtless
be
forgiven
for
not
being
able
to
read
or
at
all
events
to
enjoy
us
but
is
that
a
reason
for
giving
it
up
for
not
being
in
this
other
sphere
if
one
possibly
can
an
addison
a
ruskin
a
renan
ah
we
must
write
our
best
it
the
great
thing
we
can
do
in
the
world
on
the
right
side
one
has
one
form
and
a
mighty
good
thing
that
one
has
i
not
afraid
of
putting
all
life
into
mine
and
without
unduly
squeezing
it
i
not
afraid
of
putting
in
honour
and
courage
and
charity
without
spoiling
them
on
the
contrary
i
shall
only
do
them
good
people
may
not
read
you
at
sight
may
not
like
you
but
there
a
chance
they
come
round
and
the
only
way
to
court
the
chance
is
to
keep
it
up
always
to
keep
it
up
that
what
i
do
my
dear
man
if
you
do
think
i
perseverance
if
some
one
touched
here
and
there
if
you
give
a
little
impression
of
truth
and
charm
that
your
reward
besides
of
course
the
pleasure
for
yourself
do
you
think
your
style
a
trifle
affected
nick
asked
for
further
amusement
that
always
the
charge
against
a
personal
manner
if
you
any
at
all
people
think
you
too
much
perhaps
perhaps
who
can
say
the
lurking
unexpressed
is
infinite
and
affectation
must
have
begun
long
ago
with
the
first
act
of
reflective
expression
the
substitution
of
the
few
placed
articulate
words
for
the
cry
or
the
thump
or
the
hug
of
course
one
is
perfect
but
that
the
delightful
thing
about
art
that
there
always
more
to
learn
and
more
to
do
it
grows
bigger
the
more
one
uses
it
and
meets
more
questions
the
more
they
come
up
no
doubt
i
rough
still
but
i
in
the
right
direction
i
make
it
my
business
to
testify
for
the
fine
ah
the
fine
there
it
stands
over
there
said
nick
dormer
i
not
so
sure
about
yours
i
do
know
what
i
got
hold
of
but
notre
dame
truth
notre
dame
charm
on
notre
dame
the
distracted
mind
can
rest
come
over
with
me
and
look
at
her
they
had
come
abreast
of
the
low
island
from
which
the
great
cathedral
disengaged
from
her
old
contacts
and
adhesions
rises
high
and
fair
with
her
front
of
beauty
and
her
majestic
mass
darkened
at
that
hour
or
at
least
simplified
under
the
stars
but
only
more
serene
and
sublime
for
her
happy
union
far
aloft
with
the
cool
distance
and
the
night
our
young
men
fantasticating
as
freely
as
i
leave
the
reader
to
estimate
crossed
the
wide
short
bridge
which
made
them
face
toward
the
monuments
of
old
paris
the
palais
de
justice
the
conciergerie
the
holy
chapel
of
saint
louis
they
came
out
before
the
church
which
looks
down
on
a
square
where
the
past
once
so
thick
in
the
very
heart
of
paris
has
been
made
rather
a
blank
pervaded
however
by
the
everlasting
freshness
of
the
vast
it
greeted
nick
dormer
and
gabriel
nash
with
a
kindness
the
long
centuries
had
done
nothing
to
dim
the
lamplight
of
the
old
city
washed
its
foundations
but
the
towers
and
buttresses
the
arches
the
galleries
the
statues
the
vast
the
large
full
composition
seemed
to
grow
clearer
while
they
climbed
higher
as
if
they
had
a
conscious
benevolent
answer
for
the
upward
gaze
of
men
how
it
straightens
things
out
and
blows
away
one
vapours
anything
that
said
nick
while
his
companion
exclaimed
blandly
and
affectionately
the
dear
old
thing
the
great
point
to
do
something
instead
of
muddling
and
questioning
and
by
jove
it
makes
me
want
to
want
to
build
a
cathedral
nash
inquired
yes
just
that
it
you
who
puzzle
then
my
dear
fellow
you
ca
build
them
out
of
words
what
is
it
the
great
poets
do
asked
nick
words
are
ideas
their
words
are
images
enchanting
collocations
and
unforgettable
signs
but
the
verbiage
of
parliamentary
speeches
well
said
nick
with
a
candid
reflective
sigh
you
can
rear
a
great
structure
of
many
things
not
only
of
stones
and
timbers
and
painted
glass
they
walked
round
this
example
of
one
pausing
criticising
admiring
and
discussing
mingling
the
grave
with
the
gay
and
paradox
with
contemplation
behind
and
at
the
sides
the
huge
dusky
vessel
of
the
church
seemed
to
dip
into
the
seine
or
rise
out
of
it
floating
expansively
a
ship
of
stone
with
its
flying
buttresses
thrown
forth
like
an
array
of
mighty
oars
nick
dormer
lingered
near
it
in
joy
in
soothing
content
as
if
it
had
been
the
temple
of
a
faith
so
dear
to
him
that
there
was
peace
and
security
in
its
precinct
and
there
was
comfort
too
and
consolation
of
the
same
sort
in
the
company
at
this
moment
of
nash
equal
appreciation
of
his
response
by
his
own
signs
to
the
great
effect
he
took
it
all
in
so
and
then
so
gave
it
all
out
that
nick
was
reminded
of
the
radiance
his
boyish
admiration
had
found
in
him
of
old
the
easy
grasp
of
everything
of
that
kind
everything
of
that
kind
was
to
nick
sense
the
description
of
a
wide
and
bright
domain
they
crossed
to
the
farther
side
of
the
river
where
the
influence
of
the
gothic
monument
threw
a
distinction
even
over
the
parisian
smartnesses
the
municipal
rule
and
measure
the
importunate
symmetries
the
handsomeness
of
everything
the
extravagance
of
gaslight
the
perpetual
click
on
the
neat
bridges
in
front
of
a
quiet
little
café
on
the
left
bank
gabriel
nash
said
let
sit
down
he
was
always
ready
to
sit
down
it
was
a
friendly
establishment
and
an
unfashionable
quarter
far
away
from
the
there
were
the
usual
little
tables
and
chairs
on
the
quay
the
muslin
curtains
behind
the
glazed
front
the
general
sense
of
sawdust
and
of
drippings
of
watery
beer
the
place
was
subdued
to
stillness
but
not
extinguished
by
the
lateness
of
the
hour
no
vehicles
passed
only
now
and
then
a
light
parisian
foot
beyond
the
parapet
they
could
hear
the
flow
of
the
seine
nick
dormer
said
it
made
him
think
of
the
old
paris
of
the
great
revolution
of
madame
roland
gabriel
said
they
could
have
watery
beer
but
were
not
obliged
to
drink
it
they
sat
a
long
time
they
talked
a
great
deal
and
the
more
they
said
the
more
the
unsaid
came
up
presently
nash
found
occasion
to
throw
out
i
go
about
my
business
like
any
good
citizen
that
all
and
what
is
your
business
the
spectacle
of
the
world
nick
laughed
out
and
what
do
you
do
with
that
what
does
any
one
do
with
spectacles
i
look
at
it
i
see
you
full
of
contradictions
and
inconsistencies
nick
however
objected
you
described
yourself
to
me
half
an
hour
ago
as
an
apostle
of
beauty
where
the
inconsistency
i
do
it
in
the
broad
light
of
day
whatever
i
do
that
virtually
what
i
meant
if
i
look
at
the
spectacle
of
the
world
i
look
in
preference
at
what
charming
in
it
sometimes
i
to
go
far
to
find
it
very
likely
but
that
just
what
i
do
i
go
far
as
far
as
my
means
permit
me
last
year
i
heard
of
such
a
delightful
little
spot
a
place
where
a
wild
grows
in
the
south
wall
the
outer
side
of
an
old
spanish
city
i
was
told
it
was
a
deliciously
brown
corner
the
sun
making
it
warm
in
winter
as
soon
as
i
could
i
went
there
and
what
did
you
do
i
lay
on
the
first
green
grass
i
liked
it
if
that
sort
of
thing
all
you
accomplish
you
not
encouraging
i
accomplish
my
happiness
it
seems
to
me
that
something
i
have
feelings
i
have
sensations
let
me
tell
you
that
not
so
common
rare
to
have
them
and
if
you
chance
to
have
them
it
rare
not
to
be
ashamed
of
them
i
go
after
them
when
i
judge
they
wo
hurt
any
one
you
lucky
to
have
money
for
your
travelling
expenses
said
nick
no
doubt
no
doubt
but
i
do
it
very
cheap
i
take
my
stand
on
my
nature
on
my
fortunate
character
i
not
ashamed
of
it
i
do
think
it
so
horrible
my
character
but
we
so
befogged
and
befouled
the
whole
question
of
liberty
of
spontaneity
of
good
humour
and
inclination
and
enjoyment
that
there
nothing
that
makes
people
stare
so
as
to
see
one
natural
you
always
thinking
too
much
of
they
say
i
think
too
little
gabriel
smiled
well
i
agreed
to
stand
for
harsh
said
nick
with
a
roundabout
transition
it
you
then
who
are
lucky
to
have
money
i
have
nick
explained
my
expenses
are
to
be
paid
then
you
too
must
think
of
nick
made
no
answer
to
this
but
after
a
moment
said
i
wish
very
much
you
had
more
to
show
for
it
to
show
for
what
your
little
system
the
æsthetic
life
nash
hesitated
tolerantly
gaily
as
he
often
did
with
an
air
of
being
embarrassed
to
choose
between
several
answers
any
one
of
which
would
be
so
right
oh
having
something
to
show
such
a
poor
business
it
a
kind
of
confession
of
failure
yes
you
more
affected
than
anything
else
said
nick
impatiently
no
my
dear
boy
i
more
do
i
prove
it
i
rather
disappointed
to
find
you
not
more
accessible
to
esoteric
doctrine
but
there
is
i
confess
another
plane
of
intelligence
honourable
and
very
honourable
in
its
way
from
which
it
may
legitimately
appear
important
to
have
something
to
show
if
you
must
confine
yourself
to
that
plane
i
wo
refuse
you
my
sympathy
after
all
that
what
i
have
to
show
but
the
degree
of
my
sympathy
must
of
course
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
demonstration
you
wish
to
make
you
know
it
very
well
you
guessed
it
nick
returned
looking
before
him
in
a
conscious
modest
way
which
would
have
been
called
sheepish
had
he
been
a
few
years
younger
ah
you
broken
the
scent
with
telling
me
you
going
back
to
the
house
of
commons
said
nash
no
wonder
you
do
make
it
out
my
situation
certainly
absurd
enough
what
i
really
hanker
for
is
to
be
a
painter
and
of
portraits
on
the
whole
i
think
that
the
abject
crude
ridiculous
fact
in
this
corner
at
the
dead
of
night
in
lowered
tones
i
venture
to
disclose
it
to
you
is
that
the
æsthetic
life
do
you
know
how
to
paint
asked
nash
not
in
the
least
no
element
of
burlesque
is
therefore
wanting
to
my
position
that
makes
no
difference
i
so
glad
so
glad
i
do
know
how
so
glad
of
it
all
yes
that
only
makes
it
better
you
a
delightful
case
and
i
like
delightful
cases
we
must
see
it
through
i
rejoice
i
met
you
again
do
you
think
i
can
do
anything
nick
inquired
paint
good
pictures
how
can
i
tell
without
seeing
some
of
your
work
does
it
come
back
to
me
that
at
oxford
you
used
to
sketch
very
prettily
but
that
the
last
thing
that
matters
what
does
matter
then
nick
asked
with
his
eyes
on
his
companion
to
be
on
the
right
side
on
the
side
of
the
there
be
precious
little
of
the
if
i
produce
nothing
but
daubs
ah
you
cling
to
the
old
false
measure
of
success
i
must
cure
you
of
that
there
be
the
beauty
of
having
been
disinterested
and
independent
of
having
taken
the
world
in
the
free
brave
personal
way
i
shall
nevertheless
paint
decently
if
i
can
nick
presently
said
i
almost
sorry
it
will
make
your
case
less
clear
your
example
less
grand
my
example
will
be
grand
enough
with
the
fight
i
shall
have
to
make
the
fight
with
whom
with
myself
first
of
all
i
awfully
against
it
ah
but
you
have
me
on
the
other
side
nash
smiled
well
you
have
more
than
a
handful
to
meet
everything
every
one
that
belongs
to
me
that
touches
me
near
or
far
my
family
my
blood
my
heredity
my
traditions
my
promises
my
circumstances
my
prejudices
my
little
past
such
as
it
is
my
great
future
such
as
it
has
been
supposed
it
may
be
i
see
i
see
it
splendid
nash
exclaimed
and
dallow
into
the
bargain
he
added
yes
dallow
if
you
like
are
you
in
love
with
her
not
in
the
least
well
she
is
with
you
so
i
understood
do
say
that
said
nick
dormer
with
sudden
sternness
ah
you
are
you
are
his
companion
pronounced
judging
apparently
from
this
accent
i
do
know
i
am
heaven
help
me
nick
broke
out
tossing
his
hat
down
on
his
little
tin
table
with
vehemence
i
a
freak
of
nature
and
a
sport
of
the
mocking
gods
why
should
they
go
out
of
their
way
to
worry
me
why
should
they
do
everything
so
inconsequent
so
improbable
so
preposterous
it
the
vulgarest
practical
joke
there
has
never
been
anything
of
the
sort
among
us
we
all
philistines
to
the
core
with
about
as
much
esthetic
sense
as
that
hat
it
excellent
soil
i
complain
of
it
but
not
a
soil
to
grow
that
flower
from
where
the
devil
then
has
the
seed
been
dropped
i
look
back
from
generation
to
generation
i
scour
our
annals
without
finding
the
least
little
sketching
grandmother
any
sign
of
a
building
or
versifying
or
collecting
or
even
ancestor
they
were
all
as
blind
as
bats
and
none
the
less
happy
for
that
i
a
wanton
variation
an
unaccountable
monster
my
dear
father
rest
his
soul
went
through
life
without
a
suspicion
that
there
anything
in
it
that
ca
be
boiled
into
and
became
in
that
conviction
a
very
distinguished
person
he
brought
me
up
in
the
same
simplicity
and
in
the
hope
of
the
same
eminence
it
would
have
been
better
if
i
had
remained
so
i
think
it
partly
your
fault
that
i
have
nick
went
on
at
oxford
you
were
very
bad
company
for
me
my
evil
genius
you
opened
my
eyes
you
communicated
the
poison
since
then
little
by
little
it
has
been
working
within
me
vaguely
covertly
insensibly
at
first
but
during
the
last
year
or
two
with
violence
pertinacity
cruelty
i
resorted
to
every
antidote
in
life
but
it
no
use
i
stricken
vénus
toute
entière
à
sa
proie
putting
venus
for
it
tears
me
to
pieces
as
i
may
say
i
see
i
follow
you
said
nash
who
had
listened
to
this
recital
with
radiant
interest
and
curiosity
and
that
why
you
are
going
to
stand
precisely
it
an
antidote
and
at
present
you
another
another
that
why
i
jumped
at
you
a
bigger
dose
of
you
may
disagree
with
me
to
that

gabriel
nash
x
for
several
days
peter
sherringham
had
business
in
hand
which
left
him
neither
time
nor
freedom
of
mind
to
occupy
himself
actively
with
the
ladies
of
the
hôtel
de
la
garonne
there
were
moments
when
they
brushed
across
his
memory
but
their
passage
was
rapid
and
not
lighted
with
complacent
attention
for
he
shrank
from
bringing
to
the
proof
the
question
of
whether
miriam
would
be
an
interest
or
only
a
bore
she
had
left
him
after
their
second
meeting
with
a
quickened
sympathy
but
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
that
flame
had
burned
dim
like
most
other
men
he
was
a
mixture
of
impulse
and
reflexion
but
was
peculiar
in
this
that
thinking
things
over
almost
always
made
him
think
less
conveniently
he
found
illusions
necessary
so
that
in
order
to
keep
an
adequate
number
going
he
often
forbade
himself
any
excess
of
that
exercise
rooth
and
her
daughter
were
there
and
could
certainly
be
trusted
to
make
themselves
felt
he
was
conscious
of
their
anxiety
and
their
calculations
as
of
a
frequent
oppression
and
knew
that
whatever
results
might
ensue
he
should
have
to
do
the
costly
thing
for
them
an
idea
of
tenacity
of
worrying
feminine
duration
associated
itself
with
their
presence
he
would
have
assented
with
a
silent
nod
to
the
proposition
enunciated
by
gabriel
nash
that
he
was
saddled
with
them
remedies
hovered
before
him
but
these
figured
also
at
the
same
time
as
complications
ranging
vaguely
from
the
expenditure
of
money
to
the
discovery
that
he
was
in
love
this
latter
accident
would
be
particularly
tedious
he
had
a
full
perception
of
the
arts
by
which
the
girl
mother
might
succeed
in
making
it
so
it
would
be
a
compensation
for
trouble
but
a
trouble
which
in
itself
would
require
compensations
would
that
balm
spring
from
the
spectacle
of
the
young
lady
genius
the
genius
would
have
to
be
very
great
to
justify
a
rising
young
diplomatist
in
making
a
fool
of
himself
with
the
excuse
of
pressing
work
he
put
off
miss
rooth
from
day
to
day
and
from
day
to
day
he
expected
to
hear
her
knock
at
his
door
it
would
be
time
enough
when
they
ran
him
to
earth
again
and
he
was
unable
to
see
how
after
all
he
could
serve
them
even
then
he
had
proposed
impetuously
a
course
of
the
theatres
but
that
would
be
a
considerable
personal
effort
now
that
the
summer
was
about
to
begin
a
free
bid
for
bad
air
stale
pieces
and
tired
actors
when
however
more
than
a
week
had
elapsed
without
a
reminder
of
his
neglected
promise
it
came
over
him
that
he
must
himself
in
honour
give
a
sign
there
was
a
delicacy
in
such
unexpected
and
such
difficult
discretion
he
was
touched
by
being
let
alone
the
flurry
of
work
at
the
embassy
was
over
and
he
had
time
to
ask
himself
what
in
especial
he
should
do
he
wanted
something
definite
to
suggest
before
communicating
with
the
hôtel
de
la
garonne
as
a
consequence
of
this
speculation
he
went
back
to
madame
carré
to
ask
her
to
reconsider
her
stern
judgement
and
give
the
young
english
lady
to
oblige
him
a
dozen
lessons
of
the
sort
she
knew
so
well
how
to
give
he
was
aware
that
this
request
scarcely
stood
on
its
feet
for
in
the
first
place
madame
carré
never
reconsidered
when
once
she
had
got
her
impression
and
in
the
second
never
wasted
herself
on
subjects
whom
nature
had
not
formed
to
do
her
honour
he
knew
his
asking
her
to
strain
a
point
to
please
him
would
give
her
a
false
idea
save
that
for
that
matter
she
had
it
already
of
his
relations
actual
or
prospective
with
the
girl
but
he
decided
he
need
care
for
this
since
miriam
herself
probably
would
care
what
he
had
mainly
in
mind
was
to
say
to
the
old
actress
that
she
had
been
mistaken
the
was
such
a
this
would
take
some
courage
but
it
would
also
add
to
the
amusement
of
his
visit
he
found
her
at
home
but
as
soon
as
he
had
expressed
his
conviction
she
began
oh
your
i
know
a
great
deal
more
about
her
than
you
she
has
been
back
to
see
me
twice
she
does
go
the
longest
way
round
she
charges
me
like
a
grenadier
and
asks
me
to
give
her
guess
a
little
what
private
recitations
all
to
herself
if
she
does
succeed
it
wo
be
for
want
of
knowing
how
to
thump
at
doors
the
other
day
when
i
came
in
she
was
waiting
for
me
she
had
been
there
two
hours
my
private
recitations
have
you
an
idea
what
people
pay
for
them
between
artists
you
know
there
are
easier
conditions
sherringham
laughed
how
do
i
know
if
she
an
artist
she
wo
open
her
mouth
to
me
what
she
wants
is
to
make
me
say
things
to
she
does
make
me
i
know
how
and
she
sits
there
gaping
at
me
with
her
big
eyes
they
look
like
open
pockets
i
daresay
she
profit
by
it
said
sherringham
i
daresay
will
her
face
is
stupid
while
she
watches
me
and
when
she
has
tired
me
out
she
simply
walks
away
however
as
she
comes
back
madame
carré
paused
a
moment
listened
and
then
cried
did
i
tell
you
sherringham
heard
a
parley
of
voices
in
the
little
antechamber
and
the
next
moment
the
door
was
pushed
open
and
miriam
rooth
bounded
into
the
room
she
was
flushed
and
breathless
without
a
smile
very
direct
will
you
hear
me
i
know
four
things
she
immediately
broke
out
then
seeing
sherringham
she
added
in
the
same
brisk
earnest
tone
as
if
the
matter
were
of
the
highest
importance
oh
how
d
do
very
glad
you
here
she
said
nothing
else
to
him
than
this
appealed
to
him
in
no
way
made
no
allusion
to
his
having
neglected
her
but
addressed
herself
to
madame
carré
as
if
he
had
not
been
there
making
no
excuses
and
using
no
flattery
taking
rather
a
tone
of
equal
authority
all
as
if
the
famous
artist
had
an
obvious
duty
toward
her
this
was
another
variation
peter
thought
it
differed
from
each
of
the
attitudes
in
which
he
had
previously
seen
her
it
came
over
him
suddenly
that
so
far
from
there
being
any
question
of
her
having
the
histrionic
nature
she
simply
had
it
in
such
perfection
that
she
was
always
acting
that
her
existence
was
a
series
of
parts
assumed
for
the
moment
each
changed
for
the
next
before
the
perpetual
mirror
of
some
curiosity
or
admiration
or
wonder
some
spectatorship
that
she
perceived
or
imagined
in
the
people
about
her
interested
as
he
had
ever
been
in
the
profession
of
which
she
was
potentially
an
ornament
this
idea
startled
him
by
its
novelty
and
even
lent
on
the
spot
a
formidable
a
really
appalling
character
to
miriam
rooth
it
struck
him
abruptly
that
a
woman
whose
only
being
was
to
make
believe
to
make
believe
she
had
any
and
every
being
you
might
like
and
that
would
serve
a
purpose
and
produce
a
certain
effect
and
whose
identity
resided
in
the
continuity
of
her
personations
so
that
she
had
no
moral
privacy
as
he
phrased
it
to
himself
but
lived
in
a
high
wind
of
exhibition
of
figuration
such
a
woman
was
a
kind
of
monster
in
whom
of
necessity
there
would
be
nothing
to
be
fond
of
because
there
would
be
nothing
to
take
hold
of
he
felt
for
a
moment
how
simple
he
had
been
not
to
have
achieved
before
this
analysis
of
the
actress
the
girl
very
face
made
it
vivid
to
him
now
the
discovery
that
she
positively
had
no
countenance
of
her
own
but
only
the
countenance
of
the
occasion
a
sequence
a
variety
capable
possibly
of
becoming
immense
of
representative
movements
she
was
always
trying
them
practising
them
for
her
amusement
or
profit
jumping
from
one
to
the
other
and
extending
her
range
and
this
would
doubtless
be
her
occupation
more
and
more
as
she
acquired
ease
and
confidence
the
expression
that
came
nearest
belonging
to
her
as
it
were
was
the
one
that
came
nearest
being
a
blank
an
air
of
inanity
when
she
forgot
herself
in
some
act
of
sincere
attention
then
her
eye
was
heavy
and
her
mouth
betrayed
a
commonness
though
it
was
perhaps
just
at
such
a
moment
that
the
fine
line
of
her
head
told
most
she
had
looked
slightly
even
when
sherringham
on
their
first
meeting
at
madame
carré
said
to
nick
dormer
that
she
was
the
image
of
the
tragic
muse
now
at
any
rate
he
seemed
to
see
that
she
might
do
what
she
liked
with
her
face
it
was
an
elastic
substance
an
element
of
like
the
flexibility
of
the
gymnast
the
lady
at
the
who
is
shot
from
the
mouth
of
a
cannon
he
winced
a
little
at
this
coarser
view
of
the
actress
he
had
somehow
always
looked
more
poetically
at
that
priestess
of
art
yet
what
was
she
the
priestess
when
one
came
to
think
of
it
but
a
female
gymnast
a
mountebank
at
higher
wages
she
did
literally
hang
by
her
heels
from
a
trapeze
and
hold
a
fat
man
in
her
teeth
but
she
made
the
same
use
of
her
tongue
of
her
eyes
of
the
imitative
trick
that
her
muscular
sister
made
of
leg
and
jaw
it
was
an
odd
circumstance
that
miss
rooth
face
seemed
to
him
a
finer
instrument
than
old
madame
carré
it
was
doubtless
that
the
girl
was
fresh
and
strong
and
had
a
future
in
it
while
poor
madame
carré
was
worn
and
weary
and
had
only
a
past
the
old
woman
said
something
half
in
jest
half
in
real
resentment
about
the
brutality
of
youth
while
miriam
went
to
a
mirror
and
quickly
took
off
her
hat
patting
and
arranging
her
hair
as
a
preliminary
to
making
herself
heard
sherringham
saw
with
surprise
and
amusement
that
the
keen
frenchwoman
who
had
in
her
long
life
exhausted
every
adroitness
was
in
a
manner
helpless
and
coerced
obliging
all
in
spite
of
herself
her
young
friend
had
taken
but
a
few
days
and
a
couple
of
visits
to
become
a
successful
force
she
had
imposed
herself
and
madame
carré
while
she
laughed
yet
looked
terrible
too
with
such
high
artifices
of
eye
and
gesture
was
reduced
to
the
last
line
of
defence
that
of
pronouncing
her
coarse
and
clumsy
saying
she
might
knock
her
down
but
that
this
proved
nothing
she
spoke
jestingly
enough
not
to
offend
but
her
manner
betrayed
the
irritation
of
an
intelligent
woman
who
at
an
advanced
age
found
herself
for
the
first
time
failing
to
understand
what
she
did
understand
was
the
kind
of
social
product
thus
presented
to
her
by
gabriel
nash
and
this
suggested
to
sherringham
that
the
was
perhaps
indeed
rare
a
new
type
as
madame
carré
must
have
seen
innumerable
varieties
he
saw
the
girl
was
perfectly
prepared
to
be
abused
and
that
her
indifference
to
what
might
be
thought
of
her
discretion
was
a
proof
of
life
health
and
spirit
the
insolence
of
conscious
resources
when
she
had
given
herself
a
touch
at
the
glass
she
turned
round
with
a
rapid
and
stood
leaning
a
moment
slightly
lowered
and
inclined
backward
her
hands
behind
her
and
supporting
her
on
the
before
the
mirror
she
waited
an
instant
turning
her
eyes
from
one
of
her
companions
to
the
other
as
to
take
possession
of
them
an
eminently
conscious
intentional
proceeding
which
made
sherringham
ask
himself
what
had
become
of
her
former
terror
and
if
that
and
her
tears
had
all
been
a
comedy
after
which
abruptly
straightening
herself
she
began
to
repeat
a
short
french
poem
an
ingenious
thing
of
the
day
that
she
had
induced
madame
carré
to
say
over
to
her
she
had
learned
it
practised
it
rehearsed
it
to
her
mother
and
had
now
been
childishly
eager
to
show
what
she
could
do
with
it
what
she
mainly
did
was
to
reproduce
with
a
crude
fidelity
but
in
extraordinary
detail
the
intonations
the
personal
quavers
and
cadences
of
her
model
how
bad
you
make
me
seem
to
myself
and
if
i
were
you
how
much
better
i
should
say
it
was
madame
carré
first
criticism
miriam
allowed
her
however
little
time
to
develop
it
for
she
broke
out
at
the
shortest
intervals
with
the
several
other
specimens
of
verse
to
which
the
old
actress
had
handed
her
the
key
they
were
all
fine
lyrics
of
tender
or
ironic
intention
by
contemporary
poets
but
depending
for
effect
on
taste
and
art
a
mastery
of
the
rare
shade
and
the
right
touch
in
the
interpreter
miriam
had
gobbled
them
up
and
she
gave
them
forth
in
the
same
way
as
the
first
with
close
rude
audacious
mimicry
there
was
a
moment
for
sherringham
when
it
might
have
been
feared
their
hostess
would
see
in
the
performance
a
designed
burlesque
of
her
manner
her
airs
and
graces
her
celebrated
simpers
and
grimaces
so
extravagant
did
it
all
cause
these
refinements
to
appear
when
it
was
over
the
old
woman
said
should
you
like
now
to
hear
how
do
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
phrased
and
trilled
the
last
of
the
pieces
from
beginning
to
end
exactly
as
her
visitor
had
done
making
this
imitation
of
an
imitation
the
drollest
thing
conceivable
if
she
had
suffered
from
the
sound
of
the
girl
echo
it
was
a
perfect
revenge
miriam
had
dropped
on
a
sofa
exhausted
and
she
stared
at
first
flushed
and
wild
then
she
frankly
gave
way
to
pleasure
to
interest
and
large
laughter
she
said
afterwards
to
defend
herself
that
the
verses
in
question
and
indeed
all
those
she
had
recited
were
of
the
most
difficult
sort
you
had
to
do
them
they
did
do
themselves
they
were
things
in
which
the
were
of
no
avail
ah
my
poor
child
your
means
are
all
you
appear
to
have
no
others
madame
carré
replied
you
do
what
you
can
but
there
are
people
like
that
it
the
way
they
made
they
can
never
come
nearer
to
fine
truth
to
the
just
indication
shades
do
exist
for
them
they
do
see
certain
differences
it
was
to
show
you
a
difference
that
i
repeated
that
thing
as
you
repeat
it
as
you
represent
my
doing
it
if
you
struck
with
the
little
the
two
ways
have
in
common
so
much
the
better
but
you
seem
to
me
terribly
to
everything
you
touch
peter
read
into
this
judgement
a
deep
irritation
miriam
clearly
set
the
teeth
of
her
instructress
on
edge
she
acted
on
her
nerves
was
made
up
of
roughnesses
and
thicknesses
unknown
hitherto
to
her
fine
this
exasperation
however
was
a
degree
of
flattery
it
was
neither
indifference
nor
simple
contempt
it
acknowledged
a
mystifying
reality
in
the
and
even
a
shade
of
importance
the
latter
remarked
serenely
enough
that
the
things
she
wanted
most
to
do
were
just
those
that
were
not
for
the
the
vulgar
obvious
dodges
the
starts
and
shouts
that
any
one
could
think
of
and
that
the
liked
she
wanted
to
do
what
was
most
difficult
and
to
plunge
into
it
from
the
first
and
she
explained
as
if
it
were
a
discovery
of
her
own
that
there
were
two
kinds
of
scenes
and
speeches
those
which
acted
themselves
of
which
the
treatment
was
plain
the
only
way
so
that
you
had
just
to
take
it
and
those
open
to
interpretation
with
which
you
had
to
fight
every
step
rendering
arranging
doing
the
thing
according
to
your
idea
some
of
the
most
effective
passages
and
the
most
celebrated
and
admired
like
the
frenzy
of
juliet
with
her
potion
were
of
the
former
sort
but
it
was
the
others
she
liked
best
madame
carré
received
this
revelation
enough
considering
its
want
of
freshness
and
only
laughed
at
the
young
lady
for
looking
so
nobly
patronising
while
she
gave
it
her
laughter
appeared
partly
addressed
to
the
good
faith
with
which
miriam
described
herself
as
preponderantly
interested
in
the
subtler
problems
of
her
art
sherringham
was
charmed
with
the
girl
pluck
if
it
was
pluck
and
not
mere
density
the
stout
patience
with
which
she
submitted
for
a
purpose
to
the
old
woman
rough
usage
he
wanted
to
take
her
away
to
give
her
a
friendly
caution
to
advise
her
not
to
become
a
bore
not
to
expose
herself
but
she
held
up
her
beautiful
head
as
to
show
how
little
she
cared
at
present
for
any
exposure
and
that
it
was
half
coarseness
madame
carré
was
so
far
right
and
half
fortitude
she
had
no
intention
of
coming
away
so
long
as
there
was
anything
to
be
picked
up
she
sat
and
still
she
sat
challenging
her
hostess
with
every
sort
of
question
some
reasonable
some
ingenious
some
strangely
futile
and
some
highly
indiscreet
but
all
with
the
effect
that
contrary
to
peter
expectation
their
distinguished
friend
warmed
to
the
work
of
answering
and
explaining
became
interested
was
content
to
keep
her
and
to
talk
yes
she
took
her
ease
she
relieved
herself
with
the
rare
cynicism
of
the
artist
all
the
crudity
the
irony
and
intensity
of
a
discussion
of
esoteric
things
of
personal
mysteries
of
methods
and
secrets
it
was
the
oddest
hour
our
young
man
had
ever
spent
even
in
the
course
of
investigations
which
had
often
led
him
into
the
the
distillery
or
back
shop
of
the
admired
profession
he
got
up
several
times
to
come
away
then
he
remained
partly
in
order
not
to
leave
miriam
alone
with
her
terrible
initiatress
partly
because
he
was
both
amused
and
edified
and
partly
because
madame
carré
held
him
by
the
appeal
of
her
sharp
confidential
old
eyes
addressing
her
talk
to
himself
with
miriam
but
a
pretext
and
subject
a
vile
illustration
she
undressed
this
young
lady
as
it
were
from
head
to
foot
turned
her
inside
out
weighed
and
measured
and
sounded
her
it
was
all
for
sherringham
a
new
revelation
of
the
point
to
which
in
her
profession
and
nation
an
intelligence
of
the
business
a
ferocious
analysis
had
been
carried
and
a
special
vocabulary
developed
what
struck
him
above
all
was
the
way
she
knew
her
grounds
and
reasons
so
that
everything
was
sharp
and
clear
in
her
mind
and
lay
under
her
hand
if
she
had
rare
perceptions
she
had
traced
them
to
their
source
she
could
give
an
account
of
what
she
did
she
knew
perfectly
why
could
explain
it
defend
it
amplify
it
fight
for
it
all
of
which
was
an
intellectual
joy
to
her
allowing
her
a
chance
to
abound
and
insist
and
discriminate
there
was
a
kind
of
cruelty
or
at
least
of
hardness
in
it
all
to
poor
peter
shy
english
sense
that
sense
which
can
never
really
reconcile
itself
to
any
question
of
method
and
form
and
has
extraneous
sentiments
to
square
to
pacify
with
compromises
and
superficialities
the
general
plea
for
innocence
in
everything
and
often
the
flagrant
proof
of
it
in
theory
there
was
nothing
he
valued
more
than
just
such
a
logical
passion
as
madame
carré
but
it
was
apt
in
fact
when
he
found
himself
at
close
quarters
with
it
to
appear
an
ado
about
nothing
if
the
old
woman
was
hard
it
was
not
that
many
of
her
present
conclusions
about
the
were
not
indulgent
but
that
she
had
a
vision
of
the
great
manner
of
right
and
wrong
of
the
just
and
the
false
so
high
and
religious
that
the
individual
was
nothing
before
it
a
prompt
and
easy
sacrifice
it
made
our
friend
uncomfortable
as
he
had
been
made
uncomfortable
by
certain
reviews
of
the
theatres
in
the
paris
newspapers
which
he
was
committed
to
thinking
important
but
of
which
when
they
were
very
good
he
was
rather
ashamed
when
they
were
very
good
that
is
when
they
were
very
thorough
they
were
very
personal
as
was
inevitable
in
dealing
with
the
most
personal
of
the
arts
they
went
into
details
they
put
the
dots
on
the
they
discussed
impartially
the
qualities
of
appearance
the
physical
gifts
of
the
poor
aspirant
finding
them
in
some
cases
reprehensibly
inadequate
peter
could
never
rid
himself
of
a
dislike
to
these
pronouncements
in
the
case
of
the
actresses
especially
they
struck
him
as
brutal
and
offensive
unmanly
as
launched
by
an
ensconced
moustachioed
critic
over
a
cigar
at
the
same
time
he
was
aware
of
the
dilemma
he
hated
it
it
made
him
blush
still
more
in
which
his
objection
lodged
him
if
one
was
right
in
caring
for
the
actor
art
one
ought
to
have
been
interested
in
every
honest
judgement
of
it
which
given
the
peculiar
conditions
would
be
useful
in
proportion
as
it
should
be
free
if
the
criticism
that
recognised
frankly
these
conditions
seemed
an
inferior
or
an
unholy
thing
then
what
was
to
be
said
for
the
art
itself
what
an
implication
if
the
criticism
was
tolerable
only
so
long
as
it
was
worthless
so
long
as
it
remained
vague
and
timid
this
was
a
knot
peter
had
never
straightened
out
he
contented
himself
with
feeling
that
there
was
no
reason
a
theatrical
critic
should
be
a
gentleman
at
the
same
time
that
he
often
dubbed
it
an
odious
trade
which
no
gentleman
could
possibly
follow
the
best
of
the
fraternity
so
conspicuous
in
paris
were
those
who
did
follow
it
those
who
while
pretending
to
write
about
the
stage
wrote
about
everything
else
it
was
as
if
madame
carré
in
pursuance
of
her
inflamed
sense
that
the
art
was
everything
and
the
individual
nothing
save
as
he
happened
to
serve
it
had
said
well
if
she
have
it
she
shall
she
shall
know
what
she
in
for
what
i
went
through
battered
and
broken
in
as
we
all
have
been
all
who
are
worthy
who
have
had
the
honour
she
shall
know
the
real
point
of
view
it
was
as
if
she
were
still
beset
with
rooth
twaddle
and
muddle
her
hypocrisy
her
idiotic
scruples
something
she
felt
all
need
to
belabour
to
trample
on
miriam
took
it
all
as
a
bath
a
baptism
with
shuddering
joy
and
gleeful
splashes
staring
wondering
sometimes
blushing
and
failing
to
follow
but
not
shrinking
nor
wounded
laughing
when
convicted
at
her
own
expense
and
feeling
evidently
that
this
at
last
was
the
high
cold
air
of
art
an
initiation
a
discipline
that
nothing
could
undo
sherringham
said
he
would
see
her
home
he
wanted
to
talk
to
her
and
she
must
walk
away
with
him
and
it
understood
then
she
may
come
back
he
added
to
madame
carré
it
affair
of
course
you
take
an
interest
in
her
for
a
month
or
two
she
sit
at
your
feet
the
old
actress
had
an
admirable
shrug
oh
i
knock
her
about
she
seems
stout
enough
xi
when
they
had
descended
to
the
street
miriam
mentioned
to
peter
that
she
was
thirsty
dying
to
drink
something
upon
which
he
asked
her
if
she
should
have
an
objection
to
going
with
him
to
a
café
objection
i
spent
my
life
in
cafés
they
warm
in
winter
and
you
get
your
lamplight
for
nothing
she
explained
mamma
and
i
have
sat
in
them
for
hours
many
a
time
with
a
of
three
sous
to
save
fire
and
candles
at
home
we
lived
in
places
we
could
sit
in
if
you
want
to
know
where
there
was
only
really
room
if
we
were
in
bed
mamma
money
sent
out
from
england
and
sometimes
it
used
to
come
once
it
did
come
for
months
for
months
and
months
i
do
know
how
we
lived
there
was
any
to
come
there
was
any
to
get
home
that
is
amusing
when
you
away
in
a
foreign
town
without
any
friends
mamma
used
to
borrow
but
people
would
always
lend
you
need
be
afraid
she
wo
borrow
of
we
rather
better
now
something
has
been
done
in
england
i
do
understand
what
it
only
fivepence
a
year
but
it
has
been
settled
it
comes
regularly
it
used
to
come
only
when
we
had
written
and
begged
and
waited
but
it
made
no
difference
mamma
was
always
up
to
her
ears
in
books
they
served
her
for
food
and
drink
when
she
had
nothing
to
eat
she
began
a
novel
in
ten
volumes
the
ones
they
lasted
longest
she
knows
every
de
in
every
town
the
little
cheap
shabby
ones
i
mean
in
the
back
streets
where
they
have
odd
volumes
and
only
ask
a
sou
and
the
books
are
so
old
that
they
smell
like
close
rooms
she
takes
them
to
the
cafés
the
little
cheap
shabby
cafés
too
and
she
reads
there
all
the
evening
that
very
well
for
her
but
it
feed
me
i
do
like
a
diet
of
dirty
old
novels
i
sit
there
beside
her
with
nothing
to
do
not
even
a
stocking
to
mend
she
does
think
that
il
i
do
know
what
the
people
take
me
for
however
we
never
been
spoken
to
any
one
can
see
mamma
a
great
lady
as
for
me
i
daresay
i
might
be
anything
dreadful
if
you
going
to
be
an
actress
you
must
get
used
to
being
looked
at
there
were
people
in
england
who
used
to
ask
us
to
stay
some
of
them
were
our
cousins
or
mamma
says
they
were
i
never
been
very
clear
about
our
cousins
and
i
do
think
they
were
at
all
clear
about
us
some
of
them
are
dead
the
others
do
ask
us
any
more
you
should
hear
mamma
on
the
subject
of
our
visits
in
england
it
very
convenient
when
your
cousins
are
dead
that
explains
everything
mamma
has
delightful
phrases
family
is
almost
extinct
then
your
family
may
have
been
anything
you
like
ours
of
course
was
magnificent
we
did
stay
in
a
place
once
where
there
was
a
and
also
private
theatricals
i
played
in
them
i
was
only
fifteen
years
old
but
i
was
very
big
and
i
thought
i
was
in
heaven
i
go
anywhere
you
like
you
need
be
afraid
we
been
in
places
i
learned
a
great
deal
that
way
sitting
beside
mamma
and
watching
people
their
faces
their
types
their
movements
there
a
great
deal
goes
on
in
cafés
people
come
to
them
to
talk
things
over
their
private
affairs
their
complications
they
have
important
meetings
oh
i
observed
scenes
between
men
and
women
very
quiet
terribly
quiet
but
awful
pathetic
tragic
once
i
saw
a
woman
do
something
that
i
going
to
do
some
day
when
i
great
if
i
can
get
the
situation
i
tell
you
what
it
is
sometime
i
do
it
for
you
oh
it
is
the
book
of
life
so
miriam
discoursed
familiarly
disconnectedly
as
the
pair
went
their
way
down
the
rue
de
constantinople
and
she
continued
to
abound
in
anecdote
and
remark
after
they
were
seated
face
to
face
at
a
little
marble
table
in
an
establishment
peter
had
selected
carefully
and
where
he
had
caused
her
at
her
request
to
be
accommodated
with
i
know
what
it
will
come
to
madame
carré
will
want
to
keep
me
this
was
one
of
the
felicities
she
presently
threw
off
to
keep
you
for
the
french
stage
she
wo
want
to
let
you
have
me
she
said
things
of
that
kind
astounding
in
the
assumption
of
quick
success
she
was
in
earnest
evidently
prepared
to
work
but
her
imagination
flew
over
preliminaries
and
probations
took
no
account
of
the
steps
in
the
process
especially
the
first
tiresome
ones
the
hard
test
of
honesty
he
had
done
nothing
for
her
as
yet
given
no
substantial
pledge
of
interest
yet
she
was
already
talking
as
if
his
protection
were
assured
and
jealous
certainly
however
she
seemed
to
belong
to
him
very
much
indeed
as
she
sat
facing
him
at
the
paris
café
in
her
youth
her
beauty
and
her
talkative
confidence
this
degree
of
possession
was
highly
agreeable
to
him
and
he
asked
nothing
more
than
to
make
it
last
and
go
further
the
impulse
to
draw
her
out
was
irresistible
to
encourage
her
to
show
herself
all
the
way
for
if
he
was
really
destined
to
take
her
career
in
hand
he
counted
on
some
good
equivalent
such
for
instance
as
that
she
should
at
least
amuse
him
it
very
singular
i
know
nothing
like
it
he
said
your
equal
mastery
of
two
languages
say
of
miriam
smiled
oh
i
do
believe
in
the
others
to
the
same
degree
i
do
imagine
that
with
all
deference
to
your
undeniable
facility
you
be
judged
fit
to
address
a
german
or
an
italian
audience
in
their
own
tongue
but
you
might
a
french
perfectly
and
they
the
most
particular
of
all
for
their
idiom
supersensitive
and
they
incapable
of
enduring
the
of
foreigners
to
which
we
listen
with
such
complacency
in
fact
your
french
is
better
than
your
english
it
more
conventional
there
are
little
queernesses
and
impurities
in
your
english
as
if
you
had
lived
abroad
too
much
ah
you
must
work
that
i
work
it
with
i
like
the
way
you
speak
you
must
speak
beautifully
you
must
do
something
for
the
standard
for
the
standard
well
there
is
any
after
all
peter
had
a
drop
it
has
gone
to
the
dogs
oh
i
bring
it
back
i
know
what
you
mean
no
one
knows
no
one
cares
the
sense
is
gone
it
is
in
the
public
he
continued
ventilating
a
grievance
he
was
rarely
able
to
forget
the
vision
of
which
now
suddenly
made
a
mission
full
of
possible
sanctity
for
his
companion
purity
of
speech
on
our
stage
does
exist
every
one
speaks
as
he
likes
and
audiences
never
notice
it
the
last
thing
they
think
of
the
place
is
given
up
to
abominable
dialects
and
individual
tricks
any
vulgarity
flourishes
and
on
top
of
it
all
the
americans
with
every
conceivable
crudity
come
in
to
make
confusion
worse
confounded
and
when
one
laments
it
people
stare
they
do
know
what
one
means
do
you
mean
the
grand
manner
certain
pompous
pronunciations
the
style
of
the
kembles
i
mean
any
style
that
a
style
that
a
system
a
consistency
an
art
that
contributes
a
positive
beauty
to
utterance
when
i
pay
ten
shillings
to
hear
you
speak
i
want
you
to
know
how
say
that
to
people
and
they
mostly
lost
in
stupor
only
a
few
the
very
intelligent
exclaim
you
want
actors
to
be
affected
and
do
you
asked
miriam
full
of
interest
my
poor
child
what
else
under
the
sun
should
they
be
is
their
whole
art
the
affectation
the
public
wo
stand
that
so
one
hears
it
said
if
that
be
true
it
simply
means
that
the
theatre
as
i
care
for
it
that
is
as
a
personal
art
is
at
an
end
never
never
never
the
girl
cried
in
a
voice
that
made
a
dozen
people
look
round
i
sometimes
think
it
that
the
personal
art
is
at
an
end
and
that
henceforth
we
shall
have
only
the
arts
capable
no
doubt
of
immense
development
in
their
way
indeed
they
already
reached
it
of
the
and
the
costumer
in
london
the
drama
is
already
smothered
in
scenery
the
interpretation
scrambles
off
as
it
can
to
get
the
old
personal
impression
which
used
to
be
everything
you
must
go
to
the
poor
countries
and
most
of
all
to
italy
oh
i
had
it
it
very
personal
said
miriam
knowingly
you
seen
the
nudity
of
the
stage
the
poor
painted
tattered
screen
behind
and
before
that
void
the
histrionic
figure
doing
everything
it
knows
how
in
complete
possession
the
personality
is
our
english
personality
and
it
may
not
always
carry
us
with
it
but
the
right
and
it
has
the
superiority
that
it
a
human
exhibition
not
a
mechanical
one
i
can
act
just
like
an
italian
miriam
eagerly
proclaimed
i
rather
you
acted
like
an
englishwoman
if
an
englishwoman
would
only
act
oh
i
show
you
but
you
not
english
said
peter
sociably
his
arms
on
the
table
i
beg
your
pardon
you
should
hear
mamma
about
our
you
a
jewess
i
sure
of
that
he
went
on
she
jumped
at
this
as
he
was
destined
to
see
later
she
would
ever
jump
at
anything
that
might
make
her
more
interesting
or
striking
even
at
things
that
grotesquely
contradicted
or
excluded
each
other
always
possible
if
one
clever
i
very
willing
because
i
want
to
be
the
english
rachel
then
you
must
leave
madame
carré
as
soon
as
you
got
from
her
what
she
can
give
oh
you
need
fear
you
sha
lose
me
the
girl
replied
with
charming
gross
fatuity
my
name
jewish
she
went
on
but
it
was
that
of
my
grandmother
my
father
mother
she
was
a
baroness
in
germany
that
is
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
baron
peter
accepted
this
statement
with
reservations
but
he
replied
put
all
that
together
and
it
makes
you
very
sufficiently
of
rachel
tribe
i
do
care
if
i
of
her
tribe
artistically
i
of
the
family
of
the
artists
me
of
any
other
i
in
the
same
style
as
that
woman
i
know
it
you
speak
as
if
you
had
seen
her
he
said
amused
at
the
way
she
talked
of
that
woman
oh
i
know
all
about
her
i
know
all
about
all
the
great
actors
but
that
wo
prevent
me
from
speaking
divine
english
you
must
learn
lots
of
verse
you
must
repeat
it
to
me
sherringham
went
on
you
must
break
yourself
in
till
you
can
say
anything
you
must
learn
passages
of
milton
passages
of
wordsworth
did
write
plays
oh
it
is
only
a
matter
of
plays
you
ca
speak
a
part
properly
till
you
can
speak
everything
else
anything
that
comes
up
especially
in
proportion
as
it
difficult
that
gives
you
authority
oh
yes
i
going
in
for
authority
there
more
chance
in
english
the
girl
added
in
the
next
breath
there
are
not
so
many
others
the
terrible
competition
there
are
so
many
here
not
that
i
afraid
she
chattered
on
but
we
got
america
and
they
have
america
a
great
place
you
talk
like
a
theatrical
agent
they
lucky
not
to
have
it
as
we
have
it
some
of
them
do
go
and
it
ruins
them
why
it
fills
their
pockets
miriam
cried
yes
but
see
what
they
pay
it
the
death
of
an
actor
to
play
to
big
populations
that
do
understand
his
language
it
nothing
then
but
the
all
his
delicacy
perishes
however
understand
perhaps
i
shall
be
too
affected
she
said
you
wo
be
more
so
than
garrick
or
siddons
or
john
kemble
or
edmund
kean
they
understood
edmund
kean
all
reflexion
is
affectation
and
all
acting
reflexion
i
do
know
mine
instinct
miriam
contended
my
dear
young
lady
you
talk
of
but
do
be
offended
if
i
tell
you
that
yours
does
exist
some
day
it
will
if
the
thing
comes
off
madame
carré
does
because
she
has
reflected
the
talent
the
desire
the
energy
are
an
instinct
but
by
the
time
these
things
become
a
performance
they
an
instinct
put
in
its
place
madame
carré
very
philosophic
i
shall
never
be
like
her
of
course
you
wo
you
be
original
but
you
have
your
own
ideas
i
daresay
i
shall
have
a
good
many
of
yours
and
she
smiled
at
him
across
the
table
they
sat
a
moment
looking
at
each
other
do
go
in
for
coquetry
peter
then
said
it
a
waste
of
time
well
that
civil
the
girl
cried
oh
i
do
mean
for
me
i
mean
for
yourself
i
want
you
to
be
such
good
faith
i
bound
to
give
you
stiff
advice
you
do
strike
me
as
flirtatious
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
it
much
in
your
favour
in
my
favour
it
does
save
time
perhaps
it
saves
too
much
do
you
think
the
artist
ought
to
have
passions
peter
had
a
pause
he
thought
an
examination
of
this
issue
premature
flirtations
are
not
passions
he
replied
no
you
simple
at
least
i
suspect
you
are
for
of
course
with
a
woman
one
would
be
clever
to
know
she
asked
why
he
pronounced
her
simple
but
he
judged
it
best
and
more
consonant
with
fair
play
to
defer
even
a
treatment
of
this
branch
of
the
question
so
that
to
change
the
subject
he
said
be
sure
you
betray
me
to
your
friend
mr
nash
betray
you
do
you
mean
about
your
recommending
affectation
dear
me
no
he
recommends
it
himself
that
is
he
practises
it
and
on
a
scale
but
he
makes
one
hate
it
he
proves
what
i
mean
said
sherringham
that
the
great
the
one
who
raises
it
to
a
science
if
we
paid
ten
shillings
to
listen
to
nash
we
should
think
him
very
fine
but
we
want
to
know
what
supposed
to
be
it
too
odious
the
way
he
talks
about
us
miriam
cried
assentingly
about
us
poor
actors
it
the
competition
he
dislikes
peter
laughed
however
he
very
he
lent
mamma
thirty
pounds
the
girl
added
honestly
our
young
man
at
this
information
was
not
able
to
repress
a
certain
small
twinge
noted
by
his
companion
and
of
which
she
appeared
to
mistake
the
meaning
of
course
he
get
it
back
she
went
on
while
he
looked
at
her
in
silence
a
little
fortune
had
not
supplied
him
profusely
with
money
but
his
emotion
was
caused
by
no
foresight
of
his
probably
having
also
to
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
for
rooth
it
was
simply
the
instinctive
recoil
of
a
fastidious
nature
from
the
idea
of
familiar
intimacy
with
people
who
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
together
with
a
sense
that
this
intimacy
would
have
to
be
defined
if
it
was
to
go
much
further
he
would
wish
to
know
what
it
was
supposed
to
be
like
nash
histrionics
miriam
after
a
moment
mistook
his
thought
still
more
completely
and
in
doing
so
flashed
a
portent
of
the
way
it
was
in
her
to
strike
from
time
to
time
a
note
exasperatingly
almost
consciously
vulgar
which
one
would
hate
for
the
reason
along
with
others
that
by
that
time
one
would
be
in
love
with
her
well
then
he
wo
if
you
do
believe
it
she
easily
laughed
he
was
saying
to
himself
that
the
only
possible
form
was
that
they
should
borrow
only
from
him
you
a
funny
man
i
make
you
blush
she
persisted
i
must
reply
with
the
though
i
not
that
effect
on
you
i
do
understand
said
the
girl
you
an
extraordinary
young
lady
you
mean
i
horrid
well
i
daresay
i
am
but
i
better
when
you
know
me
he
made
no
direct
rejoinder
to
this
but
after
a
moment
went
on
your
mother
must
repay
that
money
i
give
it
her
you
had
better
give
it
cried
miriam
if
once
mamma
has
it
she
interrupted
herself
and
with
another
and
a
softer
tone
one
of
her
professional
transitions
remarked
i
suppose
you
never
known
any
one
that
was
poor
i
poor
myself
that
is
i
very
far
from
rich
but
why
receive
favours
and
here
he
in
turn
checked
himself
with
the
sense
that
he
was
indeed
taking
a
great
deal
on
his
back
if
he
pretended
already
he
had
not
seen
the
pair
three
times
to
regulate
their
intercourse
with
the
rest
of
the
world
but
the
girl
instantly
carried
out
his
thought
and
more
than
his
thought
favours
from
nash
oh
he
does
count
the
way
she
dropped
these
words
they
would
have
been
admirable
on
the
stage
made
him
reply
with
prompt
ease
what
i
meant
just
now
was
that
you
not
to
tell
him
after
all
my
swagger
that
i
consider
that
you
and
i
are
really
required
to
save
our
theatre
oh
if
we
can
save
it
he
shall
know
it
she
added
that
she
must
positively
get
home
her
mother
would
be
in
a
state
she
had
really
scarce
ever
been
out
alone
he
might
think
it
but
so
it
was
her
mother
ideas
those
awfully
proper
ones
were
not
all
talk
she
keep
her
sherringham
accepted
this
he
had
an
adequate
and
indeed
an
analytic
vision
of
rooth
conservatism
but
he
observed
at
the
same
time
that
his
companion
made
no
motion
to
rise
he
made
none
either
he
only
said
we
very
frivolous
the
way
we
chatter
what
you
want
to
do
to
get
your
foot
in
the
stirrup
is
supremely
difficult
there
everything
to
overcome
you
neither
an
engagement
nor
the
prospect
of
an
engagement
oh
you
get
me
one
her
manner
presented
this
as
so
certain
that
it
was
worth
dilating
on
so
instead
of
dilating
she
inquired
abruptly
a
second
time
why
do
you
think
i
so
simple
i
do
then
did
i
tell
you
just
now
that
you
were
extraordinary
that
the
term
moreover
that
you
applied
to
yourself
when
you
came
to
see
me
when
you
said
a
girl
had
to
be
a
kind
of
monster
to
wish
to
go
on
the
stage
it
remains
the
right
term
and
your
simplicity
mitigate
it
what
rare
in
you
is
that
you
have
as
i
suspect
at
least
no
nature
of
your
own
miriam
listened
to
this
as
if
preparing
to
argue
with
it
or
not
only
as
it
should
strike
her
as
a
sufficiently
brave
picture
but
as
yet
naturally
she
failed
to
understand
always
at
concert
pitch
or
on
your
horse
there
are
no
intervals
the
absence
of
intervals
of
a
or
background
that
i
comprehend
you
an
embroidery
without
a
canvas
yes
perhaps
the
girl
replied
her
head
on
one
side
as
if
she
were
looking
at
the
pattern
of
this
rarity
but
i
very
honest
you
ca
be
everything
both
a
consummate
actress
and
a
flower
of
the
field
you
got
to
choose
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
i
glad
you
think
i
so
wonderful
your
feigning
may
be
honest
in
the
sense
that
your
only
feeling
is
your
feigned
one
peter
pursued
that
what
i
mean
by
the
absence
of
a
ground
or
of
intervals
it
a
kind
of
thing
that
a
labyrinth
i
know
what
i
am
she
said
sententiously
but
her
companion
continued
following
his
own
train
were
you
really
so
frightened
the
first
day
you
went
to
madame
carré
she
stared
then
with
a
flush
threw
back
her
head
do
you
think
i
was
pretending
i
think
you
always
are
however
your
vanity
if
you
had
any
would
be
natural
i
plenty
of
that
i
not
a
bit
ashamed
to
own
it
you
be
capable
of
trying
to
the
human
peacock
but
excuse
the
audacity
and
the
crudity
of
my
speculations
it
only
proves
my
interest
what
is
it
that
you
know
you
are
why
an
artist
is
that
a
canvas
yes
an
intellectual
but
not
a
moral
ah
it
everything
and
i
a
good
girl
too
wo
that
do
it
remains
to
be
seen
sherringham
laughed
a
creature
absolutely
an
artist
i
curious
to
see
that
surely
it
has
been
seen
in
lots
of
painters
lots
of
musicians
yes
but
those
arts
are
not
personal
like
yours
i
mean
not
so
much
so
there
something
left
for
what
shall
i
call
it
for
character
she
stared
again
with
her
tragic
light
and
do
you
think
i
have
a
character
as
he
hesitated
she
pushed
back
her
chair
rising
rapidly
he
looked
up
at
her
an
instant
she
seemed
so
plastic
and
then
rising
too
answered
delightful
being
you
a
hundred
xii
the
summer
arrived
and
the
dense
air
of
the
paris
theatres
became
in
fact
a
still
more
complicated
mixture
yet
the
occasions
were
not
few
on
which
sherringham
having
placed
a
box
near
the
stage
most
often
a
stuffy
dusky
at
the
disposal
of
rooth
and
her
daughter
found
time
just
to
look
in
as
he
said
to
spend
a
part
of
the
evening
with
them
and
point
the
moral
of
the
performance
the
pieces
the
successes
of
the
winter
had
entered
the
automatic
phase
they
went
on
by
the
force
of
the
impetus
acquired
deriving
little
fresh
life
from
the
interpretation
and
in
ordinary
conditions
their
strong
points
as
rendered
by
the
actors
would
have
been
as
wearisome
to
this
student
as
an
importunate
repetition
of
a
good
story
but
it
was
not
long
before
he
became
aware
that
the
conditions
could
be
taken
for
ordinary
there
was
a
new
infusion
in
his
consciousness
an
element
in
his
life
which
altered
the
relations
of
things
he
was
not
easy
till
he
had
found
the
right
name
for
it
a
name
the
more
satisfactory
that
it
was
simple
comprehensive
and
plausible
a
new
distraction
in
the
french
sense
was
what
he
flattered
himself
he
had
discovered
he
could
recognise
that
as
freely
as
possible
without
being
obliged
to
classify
the
agreeable
resource
as
a
new
entanglement
he
was
neither
too
much
nor
too
little
diverted
he
had
all
his
usual
attention
to
give
to
his
work
he
had
only
an
employment
for
his
odd
hours
which
without
being
imperative
had
over
various
others
the
advantage
of
a
certain
continuity
and
yet
i
hasten
to
add
he
was
not
so
well
pleased
with
it
but
that
among
his
friends
he
maintained
for
the
present
a
rich
reserve
about
it
he
had
no
irresistible
impulse
to
describe
generally
how
he
had
disinterred
a
strange
handsome
girl
whom
he
was
bringing
up
for
the
theatre
she
had
been
seen
by
several
of
his
associates
at
his
rooms
but
was
not
soon
to
be
seen
there
again
his
reserve
might
by
the
have
been
termed
dissimulation
inasmuch
as
when
asked
by
the
ladies
of
the
embassy
what
had
become
of
the
young
person
who
had
amused
them
that
day
so
cleverly
he
gave
it
out
that
her
whereabouts
was
uncertain
and
her
destiny
probably
obscure
he
let
it
be
supposed
in
a
word
that
his
benevolence
had
scarcely
survived
an
accidental
a
charitable
occasion
as
he
went
about
his
customary
business
and
perhaps
even
put
a
little
more
conscience
into
the
transaction
of
it
there
was
nothing
to
suggest
to
others
that
he
was
engaged
in
a
private
speculation
of
an
absorbing
kind
it
was
perhaps
his
weakness
that
he
carried
the
apprehension
of
ridicule
too
far
but
his
excuse
may
have
dwelt
in
his
holding
it
unpardonable
for
a
man
publicly
enrolled
in
the
service
of
his
country
to
be
markedly
ridiculous
it
was
of
course
not
out
of
all
order
that
such
functionaries
their
private
situation
permitting
should
enjoy
a
personal
acquaintance
with
stars
of
the
dramatic
the
lyric
or
even
the
choregraphic
stage
high
diplomatists
had
indeed
not
rarely
and
not
invisibly
cultivated
this
privilege
without
its
proving
the
sepulchre
of
their
reputation
that
a
gentleman
who
was
not
a
fool
should
consent
a
little
to
become
one
for
the
sake
of
a
celebrated
actress
or
singer
though
it
was
not
perhaps
to
be
recommended
it
was
not
a
tendency
that
was
encouraged
at
headquarters
where
even
the
most
rising
young
men
were
not
incited
to
believe
they
could
never
fall
still
it
might
pass
if
kept
in
its
place
and
there
were
ancient
worthies
yet
in
the
profession
though
not
those
whom
the
tradition
had
helped
to
go
furthest
who
held
that
something
of
the
sort
was
a
graceful
ornament
of
the
diplomatic
character
sherringham
was
aware
he
was
very
rising
but
miriam
rooth
was
not
yet
a
celebrated
actress
she
was
only
a
young
artist
in
conscientious
process
of
formation
and
encumbered
with
a
mother
still
more
conscientious
than
herself
she
was
a
a
lady
withal
very
earnest
about
artistic
about
remunerative
problems
he
had
accepted
the
office
of
a
formative
influence
and
that
was
precisely
what
might
provoke
derision
he
was
a
ministering
angel
his
patience
and
good
nature
really
entitled
him
to
the
epithet
and
his
rewards
would
doubtless
some
day
define
themselves
but
meanwhile
other
promotions
were
in
precarious
prospect
for
the
failure
of
which
these
would
not
even
in
their
abundance
be
a
compensation
he
kept
an
unembarrassed
eye
on
downing
street
and
while
it
may
frankly
be
said
for
him
that
he
was
neither
a
pedant
nor
a
prig
he
remembered
that
the
last
impression
he
ought
to
wish
to
produce
there
was
that
of
a
futile
estheticism
he
felt
the
case
sufficiently
important
however
when
he
sat
behind
miriam
at
the
play
and
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
the
stage
her
observation
being
so
keen
and
her
comments
so
unexpected
in
their
vivacity
that
his
curiosity
was
refreshed
and
his
attention
stretched
beyond
its
wont
if
the
exhibition
before
the
footlights
had
now
lost
much
of
its
annual
brilliancy
the
fashion
in
which
she
followed
it
was
perhaps
exhibition
enough
the
attendance
of
the
little
party
was
moreover
in
most
cases
at
the
théâtre
français
and
it
has
been
sufficiently
indicated
that
our
friend
though
the
child
of
a
sceptical
age
and
the
votary
of
a
cynical
science
was
still
candid
enough
to
take
the
serious
the
religious
view
of
that
establishment
the
view
of
sarcey
and
of
the
unregenerate
provincial
mind
in
the
trade
i
follow
we
see
things
too
much
in
the
hard
light
of
reason
of
calculation
he
once
remarked
to
his
young
charge
but
it
good
for
the
mind
to
keep
up
a
superstition
or
two
it
leaves
a
margin
like
having
a
second
horse
to
your
brougham
for
the
arts
the
amusements
the
esthetic
part
of
life
are
if
i
may
say
so
without
suggesting
that
they
illicit
at
any
rate
you
want
your
second
horse
your
superstition
that
stays
at
home
when
the
sun
high
to
go
your
rounds
with
the
français
is
my
second
horse
miriam
appetite
for
this
interest
showed
him
vividly
enough
how
rarely
in
the
past
it
had
been
within
her
reach
and
she
pleased
him
at
first
by
liking
everything
seeing
almost
no
differences
and
taking
her
deep
draught
undiluted
she
leaned
on
the
edge
of
the
box
with
bright
voracity
tasting
to
the
core
yet
relishing
the
surface
watching
each
movement
of
each
actor
attending
to
the
way
each
thing
was
said
or
done
as
if
it
were
the
most
important
thing
and
emitting
from
time
to
time
applausive
or
restrictive
sounds
it
was
a
charming
show
of
the
critical
spirit
in
ecstasy
sherringham
had
his
wonder
about
it
as
a
part
of
the
attraction
exerted
by
this
young
lady
was
that
she
caused
him
to
have
his
wonder
about
everything
she
did
was
it
in
fact
a
conscious
show
a
line
taken
for
effect
so
that
at
the
comédie
her
own
display
should
be
the
most
successful
of
all
that
question
danced
attendance
on
the
liberal
intercourse
of
these
young
people
and
fortunately
as
yet
did
little
to
embitter
sherringham
share
of
it
his
general
sense
that
she
was
personating
had
its
especial
moments
of
suspense
and
perplexity
and
added
variety
and
even
occasionally
a
degree
of
excitement
to
their
commerce
at
the
theatre
for
the
most
part
she
was
really
flushed
with
eagerness
and
with
the
spectators
who
turned
an
admiring
eye
into
the
dim
compartment
of
which
she
pervaded
the
front
she
might
have
passed
for
a
romantic
or
at
least
an
insatiable
young
woman
from
the
country
rooth
took
a
more
general
view
but
attended
immensely
to
the
story
in
respect
to
which
she
manifested
a
patient
good
faith
which
had
its
surprises
and
its
comicalities
for
her
daughter
patron
she
found
no
play
too
tedious
no
too
long
no
too
hot
no
tissue
of
incidents
too
complicated
no
situation
too
unnatural
and
no
sentiments
too
sublime
she
gave
him
the
measure
of
her
power
to
sit
and
sit
an
accomplishment
to
which
she
owed
in
the
struggle
for
existence
such
superiority
as
she
might
be
said
to
have
achieved
she
could
everybody
and
everything
looking
as
if
she
had
acquired
the
practice
in
repeated
years
of
small
frugality
combined
with
large
leisure
periods
when
she
had
nothing
but
hours
and
days
and
years
to
spend
and
had
learned
to
calculate
in
any
situation
how
long
she
could
stay
staying
was
so
often
a
saving
a
saving
of
candles
of
fire
and
even
as
it
sometimes
implied
a
scheme
for
stray
refection
of
food
peter
saw
soon
enough
how
bravely
her
shreds
and
patches
of
gentility
and
equanimity
hung
together
with
the
aid
of
whatever
casual
pins
and
other
makeshifts
and
if
he
had
been
addicted
to
studying
the
human
mixture
in
its
different
combinations
would
have
found
in
her
an
interesting
compendium
of
some
of
the
infatuations
that
survive
a
hard
discipline
he
made
indeed
without
difficulty
the
reflexion
that
her
life
might
have
taught
her
something
of
the
real
at
the
same
time
that
he
could
scarce
help
thinking
it
clever
of
her
to
have
so
persistently
declined
the
lesson
she
appeared
to
have
put
it
by
with
a
deprecating
ladylike
smile
a
plea
of
being
too
soft
and
bland
for
experience
she
took
the
refined
sentimental
tender
view
of
the
universe
beginning
with
her
own
history
and
feelings
she
believed
in
everything
high
and
pure
disinterested
and
orthodox
and
even
at
the
hôtel
de
la
garonne
was
unconscious
of
the
shabby
or
the
ugly
side
of
the
world
she
never
despaired
otherwise
what
would
have
been
the
use
of
being
a
only
not
to
have
been
one
that
would
have
been
discouraging
she
delighted
in
novels
poems
perversions
misrepresentations
and
evasions
and
had
a
capacity
for
smooth
superfluous
falsification
which
made
our
young
man
think
her
sometimes
an
amusing
and
sometimes
a
tedious
inventor
but
she
was
dangerous
even
if
you
believed
her
she
was
even
a
warning
if
you
did
it
was
harsh
to
call
her
a
hypocrite
since
you
never
could
have
resolved
her
back
into
her
character
there
being
no
reverse
at
all
to
her
blazonry
she
built
in
the
air
and
was
not
less
amiable
than
she
pretended
only
that
was
a
pretension
too
she
moved
altogether
in
a
world
of
elegant
fable
and
fancy
and
sherringham
had
to
live
there
with
her
for
miriam
sake
live
there
in
sociable
vulgar
assent
and
despite
his
feeling
it
rather
a
low
neighbourhood
he
was
at
a
loss
how
to
take
what
she
said
she
talked
sweetly
and
discursively
of
so
many
things
till
he
simply
noted
that
he
could
only
take
it
always
for
untrue
when
miriam
laughed
at
her
he
was
rather
disagreeably
affected
dear
mamma
fine
stories
was
a
sufficiently
cynical
reference
to
the
immemorial
infirmity
of
a
parent
but
when
the
girl
backed
her
up
as
he
phrased
it
to
himself
he
liked
that
even
less
rooth
was
very
fond
of
a
moral
and
had
never
lost
her
taste
for
edification
she
delighted
in
a
beautiful
character
and
was
gratified
to
find
so
many
more
than
she
had
supposed
represented
in
the
contemporary
french
drama
she
never
failed
to
direct
miriam
attention
to
them
and
to
remind
her
that
there
is
nothing
in
life
so
grand
as
a
sublime
act
above
all
when
sublimely
explained
peter
made
much
of
the
difference
between
the
mother
and
the
daughter
thinking
it
singularly
marked
the
way
one
took
everything
for
the
sense
or
behaved
as
if
she
did
caring
only
for
the
plot
and
the
romance
the
triumph
or
defeat
of
virtue
and
the
moral
comfort
of
it
all
and
the
way
the
other
was
alive
but
to
the
manner
and
the
art
of
it
the
intensity
of
truth
to
appearances
rooth
abounded
in
impressive
evocations
and
yet
he
saw
no
link
between
her
facile
genius
and
that
of
which
miriam
gave
symptoms
the
poor
lady
never
could
have
been
accused
of
successful
deceit
whereas
the
triumph
of
fraud
was
exactly
what
her
clever
child
achieved
she
made
even
the
true
seem
fictive
while
miriam
effort
was
to
make
the
fictive
true
sherringham
thought
it
an
odd
unpromising
stock
that
of
the
for
a
dramatic
talent
to
have
sprung
from
till
he
reflected
that
the
evolution
was
after
all
natural
the
figurative
impulse
in
the
mother
had
become
conscious
and
therefore
higher
through
finding
an
aim
which
was
beauty
in
the
daughter
likely
enough
the
hebraic
rooth
with
his
love
of
old
pots
and
christian
had
supplied
in
the
girl
composition
the
esthetic
element
the
sense
of
colour
and
form
in
their
visits
to
the
theatre
there
was
nothing
rooth
more
insisted
on
than
the
unprofitableness
of
deceit
as
shown
by
the
most
distinguished
authors
the
folly
and
degradation
the
corrosive
effect
on
the
spirit
of
tortuous
ways
their
companion
soon
gave
up
the
futile
task
of
piecing
together
her
incongruous
references
to
her
early
life
and
her
family
in
england
he
renounced
even
the
doctrine
that
there
was
a
residuum
of
truth
in
her
claim
of
great
relationships
since
existent
or
not
he
cared
equally
little
for
her
ramifications
the
principle
of
this
indifference
was
at
bottom
a
certain
desire
to
disconnect
and
isolate
miriam
for
it
was
disagreeable
not
to
be
independent
in
dealing
with
her
and
he
could
be
fully
so
only
if
she
herself
were
the
early
weeks
of
that
summer
they
went
on
indeed
into
august
were
destined
to
establish
themselves
in
his
memory
as
a
season
of
pleasant
things
the
ambassador
went
away
and
peter
had
to
wait
for
his
own
holiday
which
he
did
during
the
hot
days
contentedly
enough
waited
in
spacious
halls
and
a
vast
dim
garden
the
official
world
and
most
other
worlds
withdrew
from
paris
and
the
place
de
la
concorde
a
larger
whiter
desert
than
ever
became
by
a
reversal
of
custom
explorable
with
safety
the
champs
elysées
were
dusty
and
rural
with
little
creaking
booths
and
exhibitions
that
made
a
noise
like
grasshoppers
the
arc
de
triomphe
threw
its
cool
thick
shadow
for
a
mile
the
palais
de
glittered
in
the
light
of
the
long
days
the
cabmen
in
their
red
waistcoats
dozed
inside
their
boxes
while
sherringham
permitted
himself
a
pot
hat
and
rarely
met
a
friend
thus
was
miriam
as
islanded
as
the
chained
andromeda
and
thus
was
it
possible
to
deal
with
her
even
in
deep
detachment
the
theatres
on
the
boulevard
closed
for
the
most
part
but
the
great
temple
of
the
rue
de
richelieu
with
an
esthetic
responsibility
continued
imperturbably
to
dispense
examples
of
style
madame
carré
was
going
to
vichy
but
had
not
yet
taken
flight
which
was
a
great
advantage
for
miriam
who
could
now
solicit
her
attention
with
the
consciousness
that
she
had
no
engagements
i
make
her
listen
to
me
i
make
her
tell
me
said
the
ardent
girl
who
was
always
climbing
the
slope
of
the
rue
de
constantinople
on
the
shady
side
where
of
july
mornings
a
smell
of
violets
came
from
the
moist
of
fat
in
the
angles
of
doorways
miriam
liked
the
paris
of
the
summer
mornings
the
clever
freshness
of
all
the
little
trades
and
the
life
the
cries
the
talk
from
door
to
door
which
reminded
her
of
the
south
where
in
the
multiplicity
of
her
habitations
she
had
lived
and
most
of
all
the
great
amusement
or
nearly
of
her
walk
the
enviable
baskets
of
the
laundress
piled
up
with
frilled
and
fluted
whiteness
the
certain
luxury
she
felt
while
she
passed
with
quick
prevision
of
her
own
dawn
of
glory
the
greatest
amusement
perhaps
was
to
recognise
the
pretty
sentiment
of
earliness
the
particular
congruity
with
the
hour
in
the
studied
selected
dress
of
the
little
tripping
women
who
were
taking
the
day
for
important
advantages
while
it
was
tender
at
any
rate
she
mostly
brought
with
her
from
her
passage
through
the
town
good
humour
enough
with
the
penny
bunch
of
violets
she
always
stuck
in
the
front
of
her
dress
for
whatever
awaited
her
at
madame
carré
she
declared
to
her
friend
that
her
dear
mistress
was
terribly
severe
giving
her
the
most
difficult
the
most
exhausting
exercises
showing
a
kind
of
rage
for
breaking
her
in
so
much
the
better
sherringham
duly
answered
but
he
asked
no
questions
and
was
glad
to
let
the
preceptress
and
the
pupil
fight
it
out
together
he
wanted
for
the
moment
to
know
as
little
as
possible
about
their
ways
together
he
had
been
with
that
knowledge
while
attending
at
their
second
interview
he
would
send
madame
carré
her
money
she
was
really
most
obliging
and
in
the
meantime
was
certain
miriam
could
take
care
of
herself
sometimes
he
remarked
to
her
that
she
need
always
talk
shop
to
him
there
were
times
when
he
was
mortally
tired
of
shop
of
hers
moreover
he
frankly
admitted
that
he
was
tired
of
his
own
so
that
the
restriction
was
not
brutal
when
she
replied
staring
why
i
thought
you
considered
it
as
such
a
beautiful
interesting
art
he
had
no
rejoinder
more
philosophic
than
well
i
do
but
there
are
moments
when
i
quite
sick
of
it
all
the
same
at
other
times
he
put
it
oh
yes
the
results
the
finished
thing
the
dish
perfectly
seasoned
and
served
not
the
mess
of
preparation
at
least
not
always
not
the
experiments
that
spoil
the
material
i
supposed
you
to
feel
just
these
questions
of
study
of
the
artistic
education
as
you
called
it
to
me
so
fascinating
the
girl
persisted
she
was
sometimes
so
flatly
lucid
well
after
all
i
not
an
actor
myself
he
could
but
impatiently
sigh
you
might
be
one
if
you
were
serious
she
would
imperturbably
say
to
this
her
friend
replied
that
gabriel
nash
ought
to
hear
this
which
made
her
promise
with
a
certain
grimness
that
she
would
settle
and
his
theories
some
day
not
to
seem
too
inconsistent
for
it
was
cruel
to
bewilder
her
when
he
had
taken
her
up
to
enlighten
peter
repeated
over
that
for
a
man
like
himself
the
interest
of
the
whole
thing
depended
on
its
being
considered
in
a
large
liberal
way
and
with
an
intelligence
that
lifted
it
out
of
the
question
of
the
little
tricks
of
the
trade
gave
it
beauty
and
elevation
but
she
hereupon
let
him
know
that
madame
carré
held
there
were
no
tricks
that
everything
had
its
importance
as
a
means
to
a
great
end
and
that
if
you
were
not
willing
to
try
to
the
reason
why
in
a
given
situation
you
should
scratch
your
nose
with
your
left
hand
rather
than
with
your
right
you
were
not
worthy
to
tread
any
stage
that
respected
itself
that
very
well
but
if
i
must
go
into
details
read
me
a
little
shelley
groaned
the
young
man
in
the
spirit
of
a
high
you
worse
than
madame
carré
you
do
know
what
to
invent
between
you
you
kill
me
the
girl
declared
i
think
there
a
secret
league
between
you
to
spoil
my
voice
or
at
least
to
weaken
my
before
i
get
it
but
la
guerre
comme
à
la
how
can
i
read
shelley
however
when
i
do
understand
him
that
just
what
i
want
to
make
you
do
it
a
part
of
your
general
training
you
may
do
without
that
of
course
without
culture
and
taste
and
perception
but
in
that
case
you
be
nothing
but
a
vulgar
and
nothing
will
be
of
any
consequence
he
had
a
theory
that
the
great
lyric
poets
he
induced
her
to
read
and
recite
as
well
long
passages
of
wordsworth
and
swinburne
would
teach
her
many
of
the
secrets
of
the
large
utterance
the
mysteries
of
rhythm
the
communicableness
of
style
the
latent
music
of
the
language
and
the
art
of
composing
copious
speeches
and
of
retaining
her
stores
of
free
breath
he
held
in
perfect
sincerity
that
there
was
a
general
sense
of
things
things
of
the
mind
which
would
be
of
the
highest
importance
to
her
and
to
which
it
was
by
good
fortune
just
in
his
power
to
contribute
she
would
do
better
in
proportion
as
she
had
more
knowledge
even
knowledge
that
might
superficially
show
but
a
remote
connexion
with
her
business
the
actor
talent
was
essentially
a
gift
a
thing
by
itself
implanted
instinctive
accidental
equally
unconnected
with
intellect
and
with
virtue
sherringham
was
completely
of
that
opinion
but
it
struck
him
as
no
to
believe
at
the
same
time
that
intellect
leaving
virtue
for
the
moment
out
of
the
question
might
be
brought
into
fruitful
relation
with
it
it
would
be
a
bigger
thing
if
a
better
mind
were
projected
upon
it
projected
without
sacrificing
the
mind
so
he
lent
his
young
friend
books
she
never
read
she
was
on
almost
irreconcilable
terms
with
the
printed
page
save
for
spouting
it
and
in
the
long
summer
days
when
he
had
leisure
took
her
to
the
louvre
to
admire
the
great
works
of
painting
and
sculpture
here
as
on
all
occasions
he
was
struck
with
the
queer
jumble
of
her
taste
her
mixture
of
intelligence
and
puerility
he
saw
she
never
read
what
he
gave
her
though
she
sometimes
would
shamelessly
have
liked
him
to
suppose
so
but
in
the
presence
of
famous
pictures
and
statues
she
had
remarkable
flashes
of
perception
she
felt
these
things
she
liked
them
though
it
was
always
because
she
had
an
idea
she
could
use
them
the
belief
was
often
presumptuous
but
it
showed
what
an
eye
she
had
to
her
business
i
could
look
just
like
that
if
i
tried
that
the
dress
i
mean
to
wear
when
i
do
portia
such
were
the
observations
apt
to
drop
from
her
under
the
suggestion
of
antique
marbles
or
when
she
stood
before
a
titian
or
a
bronzino
when
she
uttered
them
and
many
others
besides
the
effect
was
sometimes
irritating
to
her
adviser
who
had
to
bethink
himself
a
little
that
she
was
no
more
egotistical
than
the
histrionic
conscience
required
he
wondered
if
there
were
necessarily
something
vulgar
in
the
histrionic
conscience
something
condemned
only
to
feel
the
tricky
personal
question
was
it
better
to
be
perfectly
stupid
than
to
have
only
one
eye
open
and
wear
for
ever
in
the
great
face
of
the
world
the
expression
of
a
knowing
wink
at
the
theatre
on
the
numerous
july
evenings
when
the
comédie
française
exhibited
the
repertory
by
the
aid
of
exponents
determined
the
more
sparse
and
provincial
audience
should
have
a
taste
of
the
tradition
her
appreciation
was
tremendously
technical
and
showed
it
was
not
for
nothing
she
was
now
in
and
out
of
madame
innermost
counsels
but
there
were
moments
when
even
her
very
acuteness
seemed
to
him
to
drag
the
matter
down
to
see
it
in
a
small
and
superficial
sense
what
he
flattered
himself
he
was
trying
to
do
for
her
and
through
her
for
the
stage
of
his
time
since
she
was
the
instrument
and
incontestably
a
fine
one
that
had
come
to
his
hand
was
precisely
to
lift
it
up
make
it
rare
keep
it
in
the
region
of
distinction
and
breadth
however
she
was
doubtless
right
and
he
was
wrong
he
eventually
reasoned
you
could
afford
to
be
vague
only
if
you
had
a
responsibility
he
had
fine
ideas
but
she
was
to
act
them
out
that
is
to
apply
them
and
not
he
and
application
was
of
necessity
a
vulgarisation
a
smaller
thing
than
theory
if
she
should
some
day
put
forth
the
great
art
it
was
purely
fanciful
to
forecast
for
her
the
matter
would
doubtless
be
by
that
fact
sufficiently
transfigured
and
it
would
signify
that
some
of
the
onward
steps
should
have
been
lame
this
was
clear
to
him
on
several
occasions
when
she
recited
or
motioned
or
even
merely
looked
something
for
him
better
than
usual
then
she
quite
carried
him
away
making
him
wish
to
ask
no
more
questions
but
only
let
her
disembroil
herself
in
her
own
strong
fashion
in
these
hours
she
gave
him
forcibly
if
fitfully
that
impression
of
beauty
which
was
to
be
her
justification
it
was
too
soon
for
any
general
estimate
of
her
progress
madame
carré
had
at
last
given
her
a
fine
understanding
as
well
as
a
sore
personal
an
almost
physical
sense
of
how
bad
she
was
she
had
therefore
begun
on
a
new
basis
had
returned
to
the
alphabet
and
the
drill
it
was
a
phase
of
awkwardness
the
splashing
of
a
young
swimmer
but
buoyancy
would
certainly
come
out
of
it
for
the
present
there
was
mainly
no
great
alteration
of
the
fact
that
when
she
did
things
according
to
her
own
idea
they
were
not
as
yet
and
seriously
judged
worth
the
devil
as
madame
carré
said
and
when
she
did
them
according
to
that
of
her
instructress
were
too
apt
to
be
a
gross
parody
of
that
lady
intention
none
the
less
she
gave
glimpses
and
her
glimpses
made
him
feel
not
only
that
she
was
not
a
fool
this
was
small
relief
but
that
he
himself
was
not
he
made
her
stick
to
her
english
and
read
shakespeare
aloud
to
him
rooth
had
recognised
the
importance
of
apartments
in
which
they
should
be
able
to
receive
so
beneficent
a
visitor
and
was
now
mistress
of
a
small
salon
with
a
balcony
and
a
rickety
to
say
nothing
of
a
view
of
many
roofs
and
chimneys
a
very
uneven
waxed
floor
an
empire
clock
an
à
highly
convenient
for
miriam
posturings
and
several
cupboard
doors
covered
over
allowing
for
treacherous
gaps
with
the
faded
magenta
paper
of
the
wall
the
thing
had
been
easily
done
for
sherringham
had
said
oh
we
must
have
a
for
our
studies
you
know
and
i
settle
it
with
the
landlady
rooth
had
liked
his
we
indeed
she
liked
everything
about
him
and
he
saw
in
this
way
that
she
heaved
with
no
violence
under
pecuniary
obligations
so
long
as
they
were
distinctly
understood
to
be
temporary
that
he
should
have
his
money
back
with
interest
as
soon
as
miriam
was
launched
was
a
comfort
so
deeply
implied
that
it
only
added
to
intimacy
the
window
stood
open
on
the
little
balcony
and
when
the
sun
had
left
it
peter
and
miriam
could
linger
there
leaning
on
the
rail
and
talking
above
the
great
hum
of
paris
with
nothing
but
the
neighbouring
tiles
and
tall
tubes
to
take
account
of
rooth
in
limp
garments
much
ungirdled
was
on
the
sofa
with
a
novel
making
good
her
frequent
assertion
that
she
could
put
up
with
any
life
that
would
yield
her
these
two
conveniences
there
were
romantic
works
peter
had
never
read
and
as
to
which
he
had
vaguely
wondered
to
what
class
they
were
addressed
the
earlier
productions
of
eugène
sue
the
compositions
of
madame
sophie
gay
with
which
rooth
was
familiar
and
which
she
was
ready
to
enjoy
once
more
if
she
could
get
nothing
fresher
she
had
always
a
greasy
volume
tucked
under
her
while
her
nose
was
bent
upon
the
pages
in
hand
she
scarcely
looked
up
even
when
miriam
lifted
her
voice
to
show
their
benefactor
what
she
could
do
these
tragic
or
pathetic
notes
all
went
out
of
the
window
and
mingled
with
the
undecipherable
concert
of
paris
so
that
no
neighbour
was
disturbed
by
them
the
girl
shrieked
and
wailed
when
the
occasion
required
it
and
rooth
only
turned
her
page
showing
in
this
way
a
great
esthetic
as
well
as
a
great
personal
trust
she
rather
annoyed
their
visitor
by
the
serenity
of
her
confidence
for
a
reason
he
fully
understood
only
later
save
when
miriam
caught
an
effect
or
a
tone
so
well
that
she
made
him
in
the
pleasure
of
it
forget
her
parent
contiguity
he
continued
to
object
to
the
girl
english
with
its
foreign
patches
that
might
pass
in
prose
but
were
offensive
in
the
recitation
of
verse
and
he
wanted
to
know
why
she
could
speak
like
her
mother
he
had
justly
to
acknowledge
the
charm
of
voice
and
tone
which
gave
a
richness
even
to
the
foolish
things
she
said
they
were
of
an
excellent
insular
tradition
full
both
of
natural
and
of
cultivated
sweetness
and
they
puzzled
him
when
other
indications
seemed
to
betray
her
to
refer
her
to
more
common
air
they
were
like
the
reverberation
of
some
tutored
circle
the
connexion
between
the
development
of
miriam
genius
and
the
necessity
of
an
occasional
excursion
to
the
country
the
charming
country
that
lies
in
so
many
directions
beyond
the
parisian
would
not
have
been
immediately
apparent
to
a
superficial
observer
but
a
day
and
then
another
at
versailles
a
day
at
fontainebleau
and
a
trip
particularly
harmonious
and
happy
to
rambouillet
took
their
places
in
our
young
man
plan
as
a
part
of
the
indirect
but
contributive
culture
an
agency
in
the
formation
of
taste
intimations
of
the
grand
manner
for
instance
would
proceed
in
abundance
from
the
symmetrical
palace
and
gardens
of
louis
xiv
peter
adored
versailles
and
wandered
there
more
than
once
with
the
ladies
of
the
hôtel
de
la
garonne
they
chose
quiet
hours
when
the
fountains
were
dry
and
rooth
took
an
armful
of
novels
and
sat
on
a
bench
in
the
park
flanked
by
clipped
hedges
and
old
statues
while
her
young
companions
strolled
away
walked
to
the
trianon
explored
the
long
straight
vistas
of
the
woods
rambouillet
was
vague
and
vivid
and
sweet
they
felt
that
they
found
a
hundred
wise
voices
there
and
indeed
there
was
an
old
white
chateau
which
contained
nothing
but
ghostly
sounds
they
found
at
any
rate
a
long
luncheon
and
in
the
landscape
the
very
spirit
of
silvery
summer
and
of
the
french
pictorial
brush
i
have
said
that
in
these
days
sherringham
wondered
about
many
things
and
by
the
time
his
leave
of
absence
came
this
practice
had
produced
a
particular
speculation
he
was
surprised
that
he
should
be
in
love
with
miriam
rooth
and
considered
at
moments
of
leisure
the
causes
of
his
exemption
he
had
felt
from
the
first
that
she
was
a
nature
and
each
time
she
met
his
eyes
it
seemed
to
come
to
him
straighter
that
her
beauty
was
rare
you
had
to
get
the
good
view
of
her
face
but
when
you
did
so
it
was
a
splendid
mobile
mask
and
the
wearer
of
this
high
ornament
had
frankness
and
courage
and
variety
no
end
of
the
unusual
and
the
unexpected
she
had
qualities
that
seldom
went
together
impulses
and
shynesses
audacities
and
lapses
something
coarse
popular
and
strong
all
intermingled
with
disdains
and
languors
and
nerves
and
then
above
all
she
was
was
accessible
almost
belonged
to
him
he
reflected
ingeniously
that
he
owed
his
escape
to
a
peculiar
cause
to
the
fact
that
they
had
together
a
positive
outside
object
objective
as
it
were
was
all
their
communion
not
personal
and
selfish
but
a
matter
of
art
and
business
and
discussion
discussion
had
saved
him
and
would
save
him
further
for
they
would
always
have
something
to
quarrel
about
sherringham
who
was
not
a
diplomatist
for
nothing
who
had
his
reasons
for
steering
straight
and
wished
neither
to
deprive
the
british
public
of
a
rising
star
nor
to
exchange
his
actual
situation
for
that
of
a
yoked
blessed
the
beneficence
the
salubrity
the
pure
exorcism
of
art
at
the
same
time
rather
inconsistently
and
feeling
that
he
had
a
completer
vision
than
before
of
that
oddest
of
animals
the
artist
who
happens
to
have
been
born
a
woman
he
felt
warned
against
a
serious
connexion
he
made
a
great
point
of
the
serious
with
so
slippery
and
ticklish
a
creature
the
two
ladies
had
only
to
stay
in
paris
save
their
and
as
madame
carré
had
enjoined
practise
their
scales
there
were
apparently
no
autumn
visits
to
english
in
prospect
for
rooth
peter
parted
with
them
on
the
understanding
that
in
london
he
would
look
as
thoroughly
as
possible
into
the
question
of
an
engagement
the
day
before
he
began
his
holiday
he
went
to
see
madame
carré
who
said
to
him
devriez
bien
nous
la
she
something
then
she
has
most
things
she
go
far
it
the
first
time
in
my
life
of
my
beginning
with
a
mistake
but
do
tell
her
so
i
do
flatter
her
she
be
too
puffed
up
is
she
very
conceited
sherringham
asked
sujet
said
madame
carré
it
was
on
the
journey
to
london
that
he
indulged
in
some
of
those
questionings
of
his
state
that
i
have
mentioned
but
i
must
add
that
by
the
time
he
reached
charing
cross
he
smoked
a
cigar
deferred
till
after
the
channel
in
a
compartment
by
himself
it
had
suddenly
come
over
him
that
they
were
futile
now
that
he
had
left
the
girl
a
subversive
unpremeditated
told
him
it
made
him
hold
his
breath
a
minute
in
the
carriage
that
he
had
after
all
not
escaped
he
in
love
with
her
he
had
been
in
love
with
her
from
the
first
hour

the
drive
from
harsh
to
the
place
as
it
was
called
thereabouts
could
be
achieved
by
swift
horses
in
less
than
ten
minutes
and
if
dallow
ponies
were
capital
trotters
the
general
high
pitch
of
the
occasion
made
it
all
congruous
they
should
show
their
speed
the
occasion
was
the
an
hour
after
the
battle
the
ponies
had
kept
pace
with
other
driven
forces
for
the
week
before
passing
and
repassing
the
neat
windows
of
the
flat
little
town
dallow
had
the
complacent
belief
that
there
was
none
in
the

which
the
looked
more
respectable
between
the
stiff
muslin
curtains
with
their
mistress
behind
them
on
her
all

silver
wheels
very
often
she
was
accompanied
by
the
liberal
candidate
but
even
when
she
was
not
the
equipage
seemed
scarce
less
to
represent
his
easy
friendly
confidence
it
moved
in
a
radiance
of
ribbons
and
and
and
smiles
of
quickened
commerce
and
sudden
intimacy
of
sympathy
which
assumed
without
presuming
and
gratitude
which
promised
without
soliciting
but
under
julia
guidance
the
ponies
pattered
now
with
no
indication
of
a
loss
of
freshness
along
the
firm
wide
avenue
which
wound
and
curved
to
make
up
in
large
effect
for
not
undulating
from
the
gates
opening
straight
on
the
town
to
the
palladian
mansion
high
square
grey
and
clean
which
stood
among
terraces
and
fountains
in
the
centre
of
the
park
a
generous
steed
had
been
sacrificed
to
bring
the
good
news
from
ghent
to
aix
but
no
such
extravagance
was
after
all
necessary
for
communicating
with
lady
agnes
she
had
remained
at
the
house
not
going
to
the
wheatsheaf
the
liberal
inn
with
the
others
preferring
to
await
in
privacy
and
indeed
in
solitude
the
momentous
result
of
the
poll
she
had
come
down
to
harsh
with
the
two
girls
in
the
course
of
the
proceedings
julia
thought
they
would
do
much
good
but
she
was
expansive
and
indulgent
now
and
had
generously
asked
them
lady
agnes
had
not
a
nice
canvassing
manner
effective
as
she
might
have
been
in
the
character
of
the
high
benignant
affable
mother
looking
sweet
participation
but
not
interfering
of
the
young
and
handsome
the
shining
convincing
wonderfully
clever
and
certainly
irresistible
aspirant
grace
dormer
had
zeal
without
art
and
lady
agnes
who
during
her
husband
lifetime
had
seen
their
affairs
follow
the
satisfactory
principle
of
a
tendency
to
defer
to
supreme
merit
had
never
really
learned
the
lesson
that
voting
goes
by
favour
however
she
could
pray
god
if
she
could
make
love
to
the
cheesemonger
and
nick
felt
she
had
stayed
at
home
to
pray
for
him
i
must
add
that
julia
dallow
was
too
happy
now
flicking
her
whip
in
the
bright
summer
air
to
say
anything
so
ungracious
even
to
herself
as
that
her
companion
had
been
returned
in
spite
of
his
nearest
female
relatives
besides
biddy
been
a
rosy
help
she
had
looked
persuasively
pretty
in
white
and
blue
on
platforms
and
in
recurrent
carriages
out
of
which
she
had
tossed
blushing
and
making
people
feel
they
would
remember
her
eyes
several
words
that
were
telling
for
their
very
simplicity
dallow
was
really
too
glad
for
any
definite
reflexion
even
for
personal
exultation
the
vanity
of
recognising
her
own
large
share
of
the
work
nick
was
in
and
was
now
beside
her
tired
silent
vague
beflowered
and
beribboned
and
he
had
been
splendid
from
beginning
to
end
beautifully
and
at
the
same
time
beautifully
clever
still
cleverer
than
she
had
supposed
he
could
be
the
sense
of
her
having
quickened
his
cleverness
and
been
repaid
by
it
or
by
his
gratitude
it
came
to
the
same
thing
in
a
way
she
appreciated
was
not
assertive
and
jealous
it
was
lost
for
the
present
in
the
general
happy
break
of
the
long
tension
so
nothing
passed
between
them
in
their
progress
to
the
house
there
was
no
sound
in
the
park
but
the
pleasant
rustle
of
summer
it
seemed
an
applausive
murmur
and
the
swift
roll
of
the
vehicle
lady
agnes
already
knew
for
as
soon
as
the
result
was
declared
nick
had
despatched
a
mounted
man
to
her
carrying
the
figures
on
a
scrawled
card
he
himself
had
been
far
from
getting
away
at
once
having
to
respond
to
the
hubbub
of
acclamation
to
speak
yet
again
to
thank
his
electors
individually
and
collectively
to
chaff
the
tories
without
cheap
elation
to
be
carried
hither
and
yon
and
above
all
to
pretend
that
the
interest
of
the
business
was
now
greater
for
him
than
ever
if
he
had
said
never
a
word
after
putting
himself
in
julia
hands
to
go
home
it
was
partly
perhaps
because
the
consciousness
had
begun
to
glimmer
within
him
on
the
contrary
of
some
sudden
shrinkage
of
that
interest
he
wanted
to
see
his
mother
because
he
knew
she
wanted
to
fold
him
close
in
her
arms
they
had
been
open
there
for
this
purpose
the
last
and
her
expectancy
now
no
longer
an
ache
of
suspense
was
the
reason
of
julia
round
pace
yet
this
very
impatience
in
her
somehow
made
nick
wince
a
little
meeting
his
mother
was
like
being
elected
over
again
the
others
had
not
yet
come
back
and
lady
agnes
was
alone
in
the
large
bright
when
nick
went
in
with
julia
he
saw
her
at
the
further
end
she
had
evidently
been
walking
up
and
down
the
whole
length
of
it
and
her
tall
upright
black
figure
seemed
in
possession
of
the
fair
vastness
after
the
manner
of
an
at
the
bottom
of
a
blank
page
the
room
rich
and
simple
was
a
place
of
perfection
as
well
as
of
splendour
in
delicate
tints
with
precious
specimens
of
french
furniture
of
the
last
century
ranged
against
walls
of
pale
brocade
and
here
and
there
a
small
almost
priceless
picture
george
dallow
had
made
it
caring
for
these
things
and
liking
to
talk
about
them
scarce
ever
about
anything
else
so
that
it
appeared
to
represent
him
still
what
was
best
in
his
kindly
limited
nature
his
friendly
competent
tiresome
insistence
on
harmony
on
identity
of
period
nick
could
hear
him
yet
and
could
see
him
too
fat
and
with
a
congenital
thickness
in
his
speech
lounging
there
in
loose
clothes
with
his
eternal
cigarette
now
my
dear
fellow
what
i
call
form
i
do
know
what
you
call
it
that
was
the
way
he
used
to
begin
all
round
were
flowers
in
rare
vases
but
it
looked
a
place
of
which
the
beauty
would
have
smelt
sweet
even
without
them
lady
agnes
had
taken
a
white
rose
from
one
of
the
clusters
and
was
holding
it
to
her
face
which
was
turned
to
the
door
as
nick
crossed
the
threshold
the
expression
of
her
figure
instantly
told
him
he
saw
the
creased
card
he
had
sent
her
lying
on
one
of
the
beautiful
bare
tables
how
she
had
been
sailing
up
and
down
in
a
majesty
of
satisfaction
the
inflation
of
her
long
plain
dress
and
the
brightened
dimness
of
her
proud
face
were
still
in
the
air
in
a
moment
he
had
kissed
her
and
was
being
kissed
not
in
quick
repetition
but
in
tender
prolongation
with
which
the
perfume
of
the
white
rose
was
mixed
but
there
was
something
else
too
her
sweet
smothered
words
in
his
ear
oh
my
boy
my
boy
oh
your
father
your
father
neither
the
sense
of
pleasure
nor
that
of
pain
with
lady
agnes
as
indeed
with
most
of
the
persons
with
whom
this
history
is
concerned
was
a
liberation
of
chatter
so
that
for
a
minute
all
she
said
again
was
i
think
of
sir
nicholas
and
wish
he
were
here
addressing
the
words
to
julia
who
had
wandered
forward
without
looking
at
the
mother
and
son
poor
sir
nicholas
said
dallow
vaguely
did
you
make
another
speech
lady
agnes
asked
i
do
know
did
i
nick
appealed
i
do
know
and
julia
spoke
with
her
back
turned
doing
something
to
her
hat
before
the
glass
oh
of
course
the
confusion
the
bewilderment
said
lady
agnes
in
a
tone
rich
in
political
reminiscence
it
was
really
immense
fun
dallow
went
so
far
as
to
drop
dearest
julia
lady
agnes
deeply
breathed
then
she
added
it
was
you
who
made
it
sure
there
are
a
lot
of
people
coming
to
dinner
said
julia
perhaps
you
have
to
speak
again
lady
agnes
smiled
at
her
son
thank
you
i
like
the
way
you
talk
about
it
cried
nick
i
like
iago
this
time
forth
i
never
will
speak
word
do
say
that
nick
said
his
mother
gravely
do
be
afraid
he
jabber
like
a
magpie
and
julia
went
out
of
the
room
nick
had
flung
himself
on
a
sofa
with
an
air
of
weariness
though
not
of
completely
extinct
cheer
and
lady
agnes
stood
fingering
her
rose
and
looking
down
at
him
his
eyes
kept
away
from
her
they
seemed
fixed
on
something
she
could
see
i
hope
you
thanked
julia
handsomely
she
presently
remarked
why
of
course
mother
she
has
done
as
much
as
if
you
had
been
sure
i
was
in
the
least
sure
and
she
has
done
everything
she
has
been
too
good
but
done
something
i
hope
you
leave
out
your
father
lady
agnes
amplified
as
nick
glance
appeared
for
a
moment
to
question
her
we
never
never
nick
uttered
these
words
perhaps
a
little
mechanically
but
the
next
minute
he
added
as
if
suddenly
moved
to
think
what
he
could
say
that
would
give
his
mother
most
pleasure
of
course
his
name
has
worked
for
me
gone
as
he
is
he
still
a
living
force
he
felt
a
good
deal
of
a
hypocrite
but
one
did
win
such
a
seat
every
day
in
the
year
probably
indeed
he
should
never
win
another
he
hears
you
he
watches
you
he
rejoices
in
you
lady
agnes
opined
this
idea
was
oppressive
to
nick
that
of
the
rejoicing
almost
as
much
as
of
the
watching
he
had
made
his
concession
but
with
a
certain
impulse
to
divert
his
mother
from
following
up
her
advantage
he
broke
out
julia
a
tremendously
effective
woman
of
course
she
is
said
lady
agnes
knowingly
her
charming
appearance
is
half
the
battle
nick
explained
a
little
coldly
what
he
meant
but
he
felt
his
coldness
an
inadequate
protection
to
him
when
he
heard
his
companion
observe
with
something
of
the
same
sapience
a
woman
always
effective
when
she
likes
a
person
so
much
it
discomposed
him
to
be
described
as
a
person
liked
and
so
much
and
by
a
woman
and
he
simply
said
abruptly
when
are
you
going
away
the
first
moment
that
civil
morning
stay
on
i
hope
stay
on
what
shall
i
stay
on
for
why
you
might
stay
to
express
your
appreciation
nick
considered
i
everything
to
do
i
thought
everything
was
done
said
lady
agnes
well
that
just
why
her
son
replied
not
very
lucidly
i
want
to
do
other
things
quite
other
things
i
should
like
to
take
the
next
train
and
he
looked
at
his
watch
when
there
are
people
coming
to
dinner
to
meet
you
they
meet
that
better
i
sorry
any
one
coming
lady
agnes
said
in
a
tone
unencouraging
to
a
deviation
from
the
reality
of
things
i
wish
we
were
alone
just
as
a
family
it
would
please
julia
to
feel
that
we
one
do
stay
with
her
how
will
that
do
when
she
alone
she
wo
be
alone
with
mrs
gresham
gresham
does
count
that
precisely
why
i
want
you
to
stop
and
her
cousin
almost
her
brother
what
an
idea
that
it
wo
do
have
you
stayed
here
before
when
there
has
been
no
one
i
never
stayed
much
and
there
have
always
been
people
at
any
rate
it
now
different
it
just
because
it
different
besides
it
is
different
and
it
never
was
said
lady
agnes
more
incoherent
in
her
earnestness
than
it
often
happened
to
her
to
be
she
always
liked
you
and
she
likes
you
now
more
than
ever
if
you
call
different
nick
got
up
at
this
and
without
meeting
her
eyes
walked
to
one
of
the
windows
where
he
stood
with
his
back
turned
and
looked
out
on
the
great
greenness
she
watched
him
a
moment
and
she
might
well
have
been
wishing
while
he
appeared
to
gaze
with
intentness
that
it
would
come
to
him
with
the
same
force
as
it
had
come
to
herself
very
often
before
but
during
these
last
days
more
than
ever
that
the
level
lands
of
harsh
stretching
away
before
the
window
the
french
garden
with
its
symmetry
its
screens
and
its
statues
and
a
great
many
more
things
of
which
these
were
the
superficial
token
were
julia
very
own
to
do
with
exactly
as
she
liked
no
word
of
appreciation
or
envy
however
dropped
from
the
young
man
lips
and
his
mother
presently
went
on
what
could
be
more
natural
than
that
after
your
triumphant
contest
you
and
she
should
have
lots
to
settle
and
to
talk
about
no
end
of
practical
questions
no
end
of
urgent
business
are
you
her
member
and
ca
her
member
pass
a
day
with
her
and
she
a
great
proprietor
nick
turned
round
at
this
with
an
odd
expression
member
am
i
hers
lady
agnes
had
a
pause
she
had
need
of
all
her
tact
well
if
the
place
is
hers
and
you
represent
the
place
she
began
but
she
went
no
further
for
nick
had
interrupted
her
with
a
laugh
what
a
droll
thing
to
when
one
thinks
of
it
and
what
does
represent
poor
stupid
little
borough
with
its
strong
though
i
admit
clean
smell
of
meal
and
its
curiously
inhabitants
did
you
ever
see
such
a
collection
of
fat
faces
turned
up
at
the
hustings
they
looked
like
an
enormous
sofa
with
the
cheeks
for
the
gathers
and
the
eyes
for
the
buttons
oh
well
the
next
time
you
shall
have
a
great
town
lady
agnes
returned
smiling
and
feeling
that
she
tactful
it
will
only
be
a
bigger
sofa
i
joking
of
course
nick
pursued
and
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
they
done
me
the
honour
to
elect
me
and
i
shall
never
say
a
word
that
not
civil
about
them
poor
dears
but
even
a
new
member
may
blaspheme
to
his
mother
i
wish
you
be
serious
to
your
mother
and
she
went
nearer
him
the
difficulty
is
that
i
two
men
it
the
strangest
thing
that
ever
was
nick
professed
with
his
bright
face
on
her
i
two
quite
distinct
human
beings
who
have
scarcely
a
point
in
common
not
even
the
memory
on
the
part
of
one
of
the
achievements
or
the
adventures
of
the
other
one
man
wins
the
seat
but
it
the
other
fellow
who
sits
in
it
oh
nick
do
spoil
your
victory
by
your
perversity
she
cried
as
she
clasped
her
hands
to
him
i
went
through
it
with
great
glee
i
wo
deny
that
it
excited
me
interested
me
amused
me
when
once
i
was
in
it
i
liked
it
but
now
that
i
out
of
it
again
out
of
it
his
mother
stared
is
the
whole
point
that
you
in
ah
i
only
in
the
house
of
commons
for
an
instant
she
seemed
not
to
understand
and
to
be
on
the
point
of
laying
her
finger
quickly
to
her
lips
with
a
hush
as
if
the
late
sir
nicholas
might
have
heard
the
only
then
while
a
comprehension
of
the
young
man
words
promptly
superseded
that
impulse
she
replied
with
force
you
be
in
the
lords
the
day
you
determine
to
get
there
this
futile
remark
made
nick
laugh
afresh
and
not
only
laugh
but
kiss
her
which
was
always
an
intenser
form
of
mystification
for
poor
lady
agnes
and
apparently
the
one
he
liked
best
to
inflict
after
which
he
said
the
odd
thing
is
you
know
that
harsh
has
no
wants
at
least
it
not
sharply
not
articulately
conscious
of
them
we
all
pretended
to
talk
them
over
together
and
i
promised
to
carry
them
in
my
heart
of
hearts
but
upon
my
honour
i
ca
remember
one
of
them
julia
says
the
wants
of
harsh
are
simply
the
national
wants
rather
a
pretty
phrase
for
julia
she
means
does
everything
for
the
place
really
their
member
and
this
house
in
which
we
stand
their
legislative
chamber
therefore
the
i
undertaken
to
fill
out
are
the
national
wants
it
will
be
rather
a
job
to
rectify
some
of
them
wo
it
i
do
represent
the
appetites
of
harsh
harsh
is
gorged
i
represent
the
ideas
of
my
party
that
what
julia
says
oh
never
mind
what
julia
says
lady
agnes
broke
out
impatiently
this
impatience
made
it
singular
that
the
very
next
word
she
uttered
should
be
my
dearest
son
i
wish
to
heaven
you
marry
her
it
would
be
so
fitting
now
she
added
why
now
nick
frowned
she
has
shown
you
such
sympathy
such
devotion
is
it
for
that
she
has
shown
it
ah
you
might
i
ca
tell
you
said
lady
agnes
reproachfully
he
blushed
at
this
as
if
what
he
did
feel
was
the
reproach
must
i
marry
her
because
you
like
her
i
why
we
as
fond
of
her
as
we
can
be
dear
mother
i
hope
that
any
woman
i
ever
may
marry
will
be
a
person
agreeable
not
only
to
you
but
also
since
you
make
a
point
of
it
to
grace
and
biddy
but
i
must
tell
you
this
that
i
shall
marry
no
woman
i
not
unmistakably
in
love
with
and
why
are
you
not
in
love
with
julia
charming
clever
generous
as
she
is
lady
agnes
laid
her
hands
on
him
she
held
him
tight
dearest
nick
if
you
care
anything
in
the
world
to
make
me
happy
you
stay
over
here
and
be
nice
to
her
he
waited
an
instant
do
you
mean
propose
to
her
with
a
single
word
with
the
glance
of
an
eye
the
movement
of
your
little
finger
and
she
paused
looking
intensely
imploringly
up
into
his
face
in
less
time
than
it
takes
me
to
say
what
i
say
now
you
may
have
it
all
as
he
made
no
answer
only
meeting
her
eyes
she
added
insistently
you
know
she
a
fine
creature
you
know
she
is
dearest
mother
what
i
seem
to
know
better
than
anything
else
in
the
world
is
that
i
love
my
freedom
i
set
it
far
above
everything
your
freedom
what
freedom
is
there
in
being
poor
lady
agnes
fiercely
demanded
talk
of
that
when
julia
puts
everything
she
possesses
at
your
feet
i
ca
talk
of
it
mother
it
too
terrible
an
idea
and
i
ca
talk
of
nor
of
what
i
think
of
her
you
must
leave
that
to
me
i
do
her
perfect
justice
you
do
or
you
marry
her
she
passionately
argued
you
feel
the
opportunity
so
beautifully
rare
with
everything
in
the
world
to
make
it
perfect
your
father
would
have
valued
it
for
you
beyond
everything
think
a
little
what
would
have
given
pleasure
that
what
i
meant
when
i
spoke
just
now
of
us
all
it
was
of
grace
and
biddy
i
was
thinking
fancy
it
was
of
him
he
with
you
always
he
takes
with
you
at
your
side
every
step
you
take
yourself
bless
devoutly
your
marriage
to
julia
he
feel
what
it
would
be
for
you
and
for
us
all
i
ask
for
no
sacrifice
and
he
ask
for
none
we
only
ask
that
you
do
commit
the
crime
nick
dormer
stopped
her
with
another
kiss
he
murmured
mother
mother
mother
as
he
bent
over
her
he
wished
her
not
to
go
on
to
let
him
off
but
the
deep
deprecation
in
his
voice
did
prevent
her
saying
you
know
it
you
know
it
perfectly
all
and
more
than
all
that
i
can
tell
you
you
know
he
drew
her
closer
kissed
her
again
held
her
as
he
would
have
held
a
child
in
a
paroxysm
soothing
her
silently
till
it
could
abate
her
vehemence
had
brought
with
it
tears
she
dried
them
as
she
disengaged
herself
the
next
moment
however
she
resumed
attacking
him
again
for
a
public
man
she
be
the
perfect
companion
she
made
for
public
life
she
made
to
shine
to
be
concerned
in
great
things
to
occupy
a
high
position
and
to
help
him
on
she
back
you
up
in
everything
as
she
has
backed
you
in
this
together
there
nothing
you
could
do
you
can
have
the
first
house
in
england
yes
the
very
first
what
freedom
there
in
being
poor
how
can
you
do
anything
without
money
and
what
money
can
you
make
for
yourself
what
money
will
ever
come
to
you
that
the
crime
to
throw
away
such
an
instrument
of
power
such
a
blessed
instrument
of
good
it
is
everything
to
be
rich
mother
said
nick
looking
at
the
floor
with
a
particular
patience
that
is
with
a
provisional
docility
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
it
is
so
fearful
to
be
poor
it
vile
it
abject
do
i
know
are
you
in
such
acute
want
he
smiled
ah
do
make
me
explain
what
you
only
to
look
at
to
see
his
mother
returned
as
if
with
a
richness
of
allusion
to
dark
elements
in
her
fate
besides
he
easily
went
on
there
other
money
in
the
world
than
julia
i
might
come
by
some
of
that
do
you
mean
mr
carteret
the
question
made
him
laugh
as
her
feeble
reference
five
minutes
before
to
the
house
of
lords
had
done
but
she
pursued
too
full
of
her
idea
to
take
account
of
such
a
poor
substitute
for
an
answer
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
for
i
known
charles
carteret
much
longer
than
you
and
i
understand
him
better
nothing
you
could
do
that
would
do
you
more
good
with
him
than
to
marry
julia
i
know
the
way
he
looks
at
things
and
i
know
exactly
how
that
would
strike
him
it
would
please
him
it
would
charm
him
it
would
be
the
thing
that
would
most
prove
to
him
that
you
in
earnest
you
need
you
know
to
do
something
of
that
sort
she
said
as
for
plain
speaking
have
i
come
in
for
harsh
asked
nick
oh
he
very
canny
he
likes
to
see
people
rich
he
believes
in
them
then
he
likely
to
believe
more
he
kind
to
you
because
your
father
son
but
i
sure
your
being
poor
takes
just
so
much
off
he
can
remedy
that
so
easily
said
nick
smiling
still
is
my
being
kept
by
julia
what
you
call
my
making
an
effort
for
myself
lady
agnes
hesitated
then
you
need
insult
julia
she
replied
moreover
if
i
money
i
sha
want
his
nick
unheedingly
remarked
again
his
mother
waited
before
answering
after
which
she
produced
and
pray
would
you
wish
to
be
independent
you
delightful
dear
mother
you
very
delightful
i
particularly
like
your
conception
of
independence
does
it
occur
to
you
that
at
a
pinch
i
might
improve
my
fortune
by
some
other
means
than
by
making
a
mercenary
marriage
or
by
currying
favour
with
a
rich
old
gentleman
does
it
occur
to
you
that
i
might
work
work
at
politics
how
does
that
make
money
honourably
i
do
mean
at
politics
what
do
you
mean
then
and
she
seemed
to
challenge
him
to
phrase
it
if
he
dared
this
demonstration
of
her
face
and
voice
might
have
affected
him
for
he
remained
silent
and
she
continued
are
you
elected
or
not
it
seems
a
dream
he
rather
flatly
returned
if
you
are
act
accordingly
and
do
mix
up
things
that
are
as
wide
asunder
as
the
poles
she
spoke
with
sternness
and
his
silence
appeared
again
to
represent
an
admission
that
her
sternness
counted
for
him
possibly
she
was
touched
by
it
after
a
few
moments
at
any
rate
during
which
nothing
more
passed
between
them
she
appealed
to
him
in
a
gentler
and
more
anxious
key
which
had
this
virtue
to
touch
him
that
he
knew
it
was
absolutely
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
had
really
begged
for
anything
she
had
never
been
obliged
to
beg
she
had
got
on
without
it
and
most
things
had
come
to
her
he
might
judge
therefore
in
what
a
light
she
regarded
this
boon
for
which
in
her
bereft
old
age
she
humbled
herself
to
be
a
suitor
there
was
such
a
pride
in
her
that
he
could
feel
what
it
cost
her
to
go
on
her
knees
even
to
her
son
he
did
judge
how
it
was
in
his
power
to
gratify
her
and
as
he
was
generous
and
imaginative
he
was
stirred
and
shaken
as
it
came
over
him
in
a
wave
of
figurative
suggestion
that
he
might
make
up
to
her
for
many
things
he
scarcely
needed
to
hear
her
ask
with
a
pleading
wail
that
was
almost
tragic
do
you
see
how
things
have
turned
out
for
us
do
you
know
how
unhappy
i
am
do
you
know
what
a
bitterness
she
stopped
with
a
sob
in
her
voice
and
he
recognised
vividly
this
last
tribulation
the
unhealed
wound
of
her
change
of
life
and
her
lapse
from
eminence
to
flatness
you
know
what
percival
is
and
the
comfort
i
have
of
him
you
know
the
property
and
what
he
doing
with
it
and
what
comfort
i
get
from
everything
dreary
but
what
you
can
do
for
us
everything
odious
down
to
living
in
a
hole
with
one
girls
who
marry
grace
is
impossible
i
do
know
what
the
matter
with
her
no
one
will
look
at
her
and
she
so
conceited
with
it
sometimes
i
feel
as
if
i
could
beat
her
and
biddy
will
never
marry
and
we
three
dismal
women
in
a
filthy
house
and
what
are
three
dismal
women
more
or
less
in
london
so
with
an
unexpected
rage
of
she
poured
out
her
disappointments
and
troubles
tore
away
the
veil
from
her
sadness
and
soreness
it
almost
scared
him
to
see
how
she
hated
her
life
though
at
another
time
it
might
have
been
amusing
to
note
how
she
despised
her
gardenless
house
of
course
it
was
a
and
she
get
used
to
that
better
than
he
could
do
for
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
into
which
in
any
case
a
woman
enters
more
than
a
man
she
felt
what
a
lift
into
brighter
air
what
a
regilding
of
his
sisters
possibilities
his
marriage
to
julia
would
effect
for
them
he
could
trace
the
difference
but
his
mother
saw
it
all
as
a
shining
picture
she
hung
the
bright
vision
before
him
now
she
stood
there
like
a
poor
woman
crying
for
a
kindness
what
was
filial
in
him
all
the
piety
he
owed
especially
to
the
revived
spirit
of
his
father
more
than
ever
present
on
a
day
of
such
public
pledges
became
from
one
moment
to
the
other
as
the
very
handle
to
the
door
of
the
chamber
of
concessions
he
had
the
impulse
so
embarrassing
when
it
is
a
question
of
consistent
action
to
see
in
a
touching
an
interesting
light
any
forcibly
presented
side
of
the
life
of
another
such
things
effected
a
union
with
something
in
life
and
in
the
recognition
of
them
was
no
soreness
of
sacrifice
and
no
consciousness
of
merit
rapidly
at
present
this
change
of
scene
took
place
before
his
spiritual
eye
he
found
himself
believing
because
his
mother
communicated
the
belief
that
it
depended
but
on
his
own
conduct
richly
to
alter
the
social
outlook
of
the
three
women
who
clung
to
him
and
who
declared
themselves
forlorn
this
was
not
the
highest
kind
of
motive
but
it
contained
a
spring
it
touched
into
life
again
old
injunctions
and
appeals
julia
wide
kingdom
opened
out
round
him
and
seemed
somehow
to
wear
the
face
of
his
own
possible
future
his
mother
and
sisters
floated
in
the
rosy
element
as
if
he
had
breathed
it
about
them
the
first
house
in
england
she
had
called
it
but
it
might
be
the
first
house
in
europe
the
first
in
the
world
by
the
fine
air
and
the
high
humanities
that
should
fill
it
everything
beautiful
in
his
actual
his
material
view
seemed
to
proclaim
its
value
as
never
before
the
house
rose
over
his
head
as
a
museum
of
exquisite
rewards
and
the
image
of
poor
george
dallow
hovered
there
obsequious
expressing
that
he
had
only
been
the
modest
tasteful
organiser
or
even
upholsterer
appointed
to
set
it
all
in
order
and
punctually
retire
lady
agnes
tone
in
fine
penetrated
further
than
it
had
done
yet
when
she
brought
out
with
intensity
do
desert
us
do
desert
us
do
desert
you
be
great
be
great
i
old
i
lived
i
seen
go
in
for
a
great
material
position
that
will
simplify
everything
else
i
do
what
i
can
for
you
anything
everything
i
can
trust
me
leave
me
alone
nick
went
on
and
you
stay
over
you
spend
the
day
with
her
i
stay
till
she
turns
me
out
his
mother
had
hold
of
his
hand
again
now
she
raised
it
to
her
lips
and
kissed
it
my
dearest
son
my
only
joy
then
i
do
see
how
you
can
resist
her
she
added
no
more
do
i
she
looked
about
there
was
so
much
to
look
at
with
a
deep
exhalation
if
you
so
fond
of
art
what
art
is
equal
to
all
this
the
joy
of
living
in
the
midst
of
it
of
seeing
the
finest
works
every
day
have
everything
the
world
can
give
that
exactly
what
was
just
passing
in
my
own
mind
it
too
much
nick
reasoned
do
be
selfish
selfish
he
echoed
unselfish
then
you
share
it
with
us
and
with
julia
a
little
i
hope
he
said
god
bless
you
cried
his
mother
looking
up
at
him
her
eyes
were
detained
by
the
sudden
sense
of
something
in
his
own
that
was
not
clear
to
her
but
before
she
could
challenge
it
he
asked
abruptly
why
do
you
talk
so
of
poor
biddy
why
wo
she
marry
you
had
better
ask
peter
sherringham
said
lady
agnes
what
has
he
to
do
with
it
how
odd
of
you
not
to
know
when
it
so
plain
how
she
thinks
of
him
that
it
a
matter
of
common
gossip
yes
if
you
will
we
made
it
so
and
she
takes
it
as
an
angel
but
peter
likes
her
does
he
then
it
the
more
shame
to
him
to
behave
as
he
does
he
had
better
leave
his
wretched
actresses
alone
that
the
love
of
art
too
mocked
lady
agnes
but
nick
glossed
it
all
over
biddy
so
charming
she
easily
marry
some
one
else
never
if
she
loves
him
however
julia
will
bring
it
about
julia
will
help
her
his
mother
pursued
more
cheerfully
that
what
do
for
us
that
do
everything
why
then
more
than
now
he
asked
because
we
shall
be
yours
you
mine
already
yes
but
she
is
however
she
as
good
lady
agnes
exulted
she
turn
me
out
of
the
house
said
nick
come
and
tell
me
when
she
does
but
there
she
is
go
to
her
and
she
gave
him
a
push
toward
one
of
the
windows
that
stood
open
to
the
terrace
their
hostess
had
become
visible
outside
she
passed
slowly
along
the
terrace
with
her
long
shadow
go
to
her
his
mother
repeated
she
waiting
for
you
nick
went
out
with
the
air
of
a
man
as
ready
to
pass
that
way
as
another
and
at
the
same
moment
his
two
sisters
still
flushed
with
participation
appeared
in
a
different
quarter
we
go
home
but
nick
will
stay
a
day
or
two
lady
agnes
said
to
them
dear
old
nick
grace
ejaculated
looking
at
her
with
intensity
he
going
to
speak
she
went
on
but
do
mention
it
do
mention
it
biddy
asked
with
a
milder
stare
has
he
spoken
enough
poor
fellow
i
mean
to
julia
lady
agnes
replied
do
you
understand
you
goose
and
grace
turned
on
her
sister
xiv
the
next
morning
brought
the
young
man
many
letters
and
telegrams
and
his
coffee
was
placed
beside
him
in
his
room
where
he
remained
until
noon
answering
these
communications
when
he
came
out
he
learned
that
his
mother
and
sisters
had
left
the
house
this
information
was
given
him
by
gresham
whom
he
found
dealing
with
her
own
voluminous
budget
at
one
of
the
tables
in
the
library
she
was
a
lady
who
received
thirty
letters
a
day
the
of
which
as
well
as
of
her
punctual
answers
in
a
hand
that
would
have
been
ladylike
in
a
manageress
was
a
puzzle
to
those
who
observed
her
she
told
nick
that
lady
agnes
had
not
been
willing
to
disturb
him
at
his
work
to
say
knowing
she
should
see
him
in
a
day
or
two
in
town
he
was
amused
at
the
way
his
mother
had
stolen
off
as
if
she
feared
further
conversation
might
weaken
the
spell
she
believed
herself
to
have
wrought
the
place
was
cleared
moreover
of
its
other
visitors
so
that
as
gresham
said
the
fun
was
at
an
end
this
lady
expressed
the
idea
that
the
fun
was
after
all
rather
a
bore
at
any
rate
now
they
could
rest
dallow
and
nick
and
she
and
she
was
glad
nick
was
going
to
stay
for
a
little
quiet
she
liked
harsh
best
when
it
was
not
then
one
could
see
what
a
sympathetic
old
place
it
was
she
hoped
nick
was
not
dreadfully
fagged
she
feared
julia
was
completely
done
up
julia
however
had
transported
her
exhaustion
to
the
grounds
she
was
wandering
about
somewhere
she
thought
more
people
would
be
coming
to
the
house
people
from
the
town
people
from
the
country
and
had
gone
out
so
as
not
to
have
to
see
them
she
had
not
gone
far
nick
could
easily
find
her
nick
intimated
that
he
himself
was
not
eager
for
more
people
whereupon
gresham
rather
archly
smiled
and
of
course
you
hate
for
being
here
he
made
some
protest
and
she
added
but
i
almost
part
of
the
house
you
know
i
one
of
the
chairs
or
tables
nick
declared
that
he
had
never
seen
a
house
so
well
furnished
and
gresham
said
i
believe
there
to
be
some
people
to
dinner
rather
an
interference
is
it
julia
lives
so
in
public
but
it
all
for
you
and
after
a
moment
she
added
it
a
wonderful
constitution
nick
at
first
failed
to
seize
her
allusion
he
thought
it
a
retarded
political
reference
a
sudden
tribute
to
the
great
unwritten
instrument
by
which
they
were
all
governed
and
under
the
happy
operation
of
which
his
fight
had
been
so
successful
he
was
on
the
point
of
saying
the
british
wonderful
when
he
gathered
that
the
intention
of
his
companion
had
been
simply
to
praise
dallow
fine
robustness
the
surface
so
delicate
the
action
so
easy
yet
the
frame
of
steel
he
left
gresham
to
her
correspondence
and
went
out
of
the
house
wondering
as
he
walked
if
she
wanted
him
to
do
the
same
thing
his
mother
wanted
so
that
her
words
had
been
intended
for
a
prick
whether
even
the
two
ladies
had
talked
over
their
desire
together
gresham
was
a
married
woman
who
was
usually
taken
for
a
widow
mainly
because
she
was
perpetually
sent
for
by
her
friends
who
in
no
event
sent
for
gresham
she
came
in
every
case
with
her
air
of
being
at
the
expense
of
dingier
belongings
her
figure
was
admired
that
is
it
was
sometimes
mentioned
and
she
dressed
as
if
it
was
expected
of
her
to
be
smart
like
a
young
woman
in
a
shop
or
a
servant
much
in
view
she
slipped
in
and
out
accompanied
at
the
piano
talked
to
the
neglected
visitors
walked
in
the
rain
and
after
the
arrival
of
the
post
usually
had
conferences
with
her
hostess
during
which
she
stroked
her
chin
and
looked
familiarly
responsible
it
was
her
peculiarity
that
people
were
always
saying
things
to
her
in
a
lowered
voice
she
had
all
sorts
of
acquaintances
and
in
small
establishments
sometimes
wrote
the
great
ones
on
the
other
hand
had
no
terrors
for
her
she
had
seen
too
many
no
one
had
ever
discovered
whether
any
one
else
paid
her
people
only
knew
what
did
if
lady
agnes
had
in
the
minor
key
discussed
with
her
the
propriety
of
a
union
between
the
mistress
of
harsh
and
the
hope
of
the
dormers
this
last
personage
could
take
the
circumstance
for
granted
without
irritation
and
even
with
cursory
indulgence
for
he
was
got
unhappy
now
and
his
spirit
was
light
and
clear
the
summer
day
was
splendid
and
the
world
as
he
looked
at
it
from
the
terrace
offered
no
more
worrying
ambiguity
than
a
vault
of
airy
blue
arching
over
a
lap
of
solid
green
the
wide
still
trees
in
the
park
appeared
to
be
waiting
for
some
daily
inspection
and
the
rich
fields
with
their
official
frill
of
hedges
to
rejoice
in
the
light
that
smiled
upon
them
as
named
and
numbered
acres
nick
felt
himself
catch
the
smile
and
all
the
reasons
of
it
they
made
up
a
charm
to
which
he
had
perhaps
not
hitherto
done
justice
something
of
the
impression
he
had
received
when
younger
from
showy
views
of
fine
that
had
pressed
and
patted
nature
as
by
the
fat
hands
of
benches
of
magistrates
and
landlords
into
supreme
respectability
and
comfort
there
were
a
couple
of
peacocks
on
the
terrace
and
his
eye
was
caught
by
the
gleam
of
the
swans
on
a
distant
lake
where
was
also
a
little
temple
on
an
island
and
these
objects
fell
in
with
his
humour
which
at
another
time
might
have
been
ruffled
by
them
as
aggressive
triumphs
of
the
conventional
it
was
certainly
a
proof
of
youth
and
health
on
his
part
that
his
spirits
had
risen
as
the
plot
thickened
and
that
after
he
had
taken
his
jump
into
the
turbid
waters
of
a
contested
election
he
had
been
able
to
tumble
and
splash
not
only
without
a
sense
of
awkwardness
but
with
a
considerable
capacity
for
the
frolic
tepid
as
we
saw
him
in
paris
he
had
found
his
relation
to
his
opportunity
surprisingly
altered
by
his
little
journey
across
the
channel
had
seen
things
in
a
new
perspective
and
breathed
an
air
that
set
him
and
kept
him
in
motion
there
had
been
something
in
it
that
went
to
his
head
an
element
that
his
mother
and
his
sisters
his
father
from
beyond
the
grave
julia
dallow
the
liberal
party
and
a
hundred
friends
were
both
secretly
and
overtly
occupied
in
pumping
into
it
if
he
but
in
victory
he
at
least
liked
the
wind
of
the
onset
in
his
ears
and
he
had
a
general
sense
that
when
one
was
stuck
there
was
always
the
nearest
thing
at
which
one
must
pull
the
embarrassment
that
is
the
revival
of
scepticism
which
might
produce
an
inconsistency
shameful
to
exhibit
and
yet
difficult
to
conceal
was
safe
enough
to
come
later
indeed
at
the
risk
of
presenting
our
young
man
as
too
whimsical
a
personage
i
may
hint
that
some
such
sickly
glow
had
even
now
begun
to
tinge
one
quarter
of
his
inward
horizon
i
am
afraid
moreover
that
i
have
no
better
excuse
for
him
than
the
one
he
had
touched
on
in
that
momentous
conversation
with
his
mother
which
i
have
thought
it
useful
to
reproduce
in
full
he
was
conscious
of
a
double
nature
there
were
two
men
in
him
quite
separate
whose
leading
features
had
little
in
common
and
each
of
whom
insisted
on
having
an
independent
turn
at
life
meanwhile
then
if
he
was
adequately
aware
that
the
bed
of
his
moral
existence
would
need
a
good
deal
of
making
over
if
he
was
to
lie
upon
it
without
unseemly
tossing
he
was
also
alive
to
the
propriety
of
not
parading
his
inconsistencies
not
letting
his
unregulated
passions
become
a
spectacle
to
the
vulgar
he
had
none
of
that
wish
to
appear
deep
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
most
forms
of
fatuity
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
pass
for
decently
superficial
he
only
aspired
to
be
decently
continuous
when
you
were
not
suitably
shallow
this
presented
difficulties
but
he
would
have
assented
to
the
proposition
that
you
must
be
as
subtle
as
you
can
and
that
a
high
use
of
subtlety
is
in
consuming
the
smoke
of
your
inner
fire
the
fire
was
the
great
thing
not
the
chimney
he
had
no
view
of
life
that
counted
out
the
need
of
learning
it
was
teaching
rather
as
to
which
he
was
conscious
of
no
particular
mission
he
enjoyed
life
enjoyed
it
immensely
and
was
ready
to
pursue
it
with
patience
through
as
many
channels
as
possible
he
was
on
his
guard
however
against
making
an
ass
of
himself
that
is
against
not
thinking
out
his
experiments
before
trying
them
in
public
it
was
because
as
yet
he
liked
life
in
general
better
than
it
was
clear
to
him
he
liked
particular
possibilities
that
on
the
occasion
of
a
constituency
holding
out
a
cordial
hand
to
him
while
it
extended
another
in
a
different
direction
a
certain
bloom
of
boyhood
that
was
on
him
had
not
paled
at
the
idea
of
a
match
he
had
risen
to
the
fray
as
he
had
risen
to
matches
at
school
for
his
boyishness
could
still
take
a
pleasure
in
an
inconsiderate
show
of
agility
he
could
meet
electors
and
conciliate
bores
and
compliment
women
and
answer
questions
and
roll
off
speeches
and
chaff
adversaries
he
could
do
these
things
because
it
was
amusing
and
slightly
dangerous
like
playing
football
or
ascending
an
alp
pastimes
for
which
nature
had
conferred
on
him
an
aptitude
not
so
very
different
in
kind
from
a
due
volubility
on
platforms
there
were
two
voices
to
admonish
him
that
all
this
was
not
really
action
at
all
but
only
a
pusillanimous
imitation
of
it
one
of
them
fitfully
audible
in
the
depths
of
his
own
spirit
and
the
other
speaking
in
the
equivocal
accents
of
a
very
crabbed
hand
from
a
letter
of
four
pages
by
gabriel
nash
however
nick
carried
the
imitation
as
far
as
possible
and
the
flood
of
sound
floated
him
what
more
could
a
working
faith
have
done
he
had
not
broken
with
the
axiom
that
in
a
case
of
doubt
one
should
hold
off
for
this
applied
to
choice
and
he
had
not
at
present
the
slightest
pretension
to
choosing
he
knew
he
was
lifted
along
that
what
he
was
doing
was
not
that
nothing
was
settled
by
it
and
that
if
there
was
a
hard
knot
in
his
life
it
would
only
grow
harder
with
keeping
doing
one
sum
instead
of
does
make
the
sum
easier
but
at
least
makes
so
sometimes
in
the
course
of
the
following
fortnight
it
seemed
to
him
he
had
gone
in
for
harsh
because
he
was
sure
he
should
lose
sometimes
he
foresaw
that
he
should
win
precisely
to
punish
him
for
having
tried
and
for
his
want
of
candour
and
when
presently
he
did
win
he
was
almost
scared
at
his
success
then
it
appeared
to
him
he
had
done
something
even
worse
than
not
choose
he
had
let
others
choose
for
him
the
beauty
of
it
was
that
they
had
chosen
with
only
their
own
object
in
their
eye
for
what
did
they
know
about
his
strange
alternative
he
was
rattled
about
so
for
a
fortnight
julia
taking
care
of
this
that
he
had
no
time
to
think
save
when
he
tried
to
remember
a
quotation
or
an
american
story
and
all
his
life
became
an
overflow
of
verbiage
thought
hear
itself
for
the
noise
which
had
to
be
pleasant
and
persuasive
had
to
hang
more
or
less
together
without
its
aid
nick
was
surprised
at
the
airs
he
could
play
and
often
when
the
last
thing
at
night
he
shut
the
door
of
his
room
found
himself
privately
exclaiming
that
he
had
had
no
idea
he
was
such
a
mountebank
i
must
add
that
if
this
reflexion
did
occupy
him
long
and
if
no
meditation
after
his
return
from
paris
held
him
for
many
moments
there
was
a
reason
better
even
than
that
he
was
tired
that
he
was
busy
that
he
appreciated
the
coincidence
of
the
hit
and
the
hurrah
the
hurrah
and
the
hit
that
reason
was
simply
dallow
who
had
suddenly
become
a
still
larger
fact
in
his
consciousness
than
his
having
turned
actively
political
she
indeed
his
being
so
in
the
sense
that
if
the
politics
were
his
how
little
soever
the
activity
was
hers
she
had
better
ways
of
showing
she
was
clever
than
merely
saying
clever
things
which
in
general
only
prove
at
the
most
that
one
would
be
clever
if
one
could
the
accomplished
fact
itself
was
almost
always
the
demonstration
that
dallow
could
and
when
nick
came
to
his
senses
after
the
proclamation
of
the
victor
and
the
drop
of
the
uproar
her
figure
was
of
the
whole
violent
dance
of
shadows
the
only
thing
that
came
back
that
stayed
she
had
been
there
at
each
of
the
moments
passing
repassing
returning
before
him
beside
him
behind
him
she
had
made
the
business
infinitely
prettier
than
it
would
have
been
without
her
added
music
and
flowers
and
ices
a
finer
charm
converting
it
into
a
kind
of
heroic
function
the
form
of
sport
most
dangerous
it
had
been
a
say
with
one
life
at
stake
from
pressure
of
the
crowd
the
concluded
affair
had
bequeathed
him
thus
not
only
a
seat
in
the
house
of
commons
but
a
perception
of
what
may
come
of
women
in
high
embodiments
and
an
abyss
of
intimacy
with
one
woman
in
particular
she
had
wrapped
him
up
in
something
he
did
know
what
a
sense
of
facility
an
overpowering
fragrance
and
they
had
moved
together
in
an
immense
fraternity
there
had
been
no
no
contact
that
was
only
personal
no
vulgarity
of
flirtation
the
hurry
of
the
days
and
the
sharpness
with
which
they
both
tended
to
an
outside
object
had
made
all
that
irrelevant
it
was
as
if
she
had
been
too
near
for
him
to
see
her
separate
from
himself
but
none
the
less
when
he
now
drew
breath
and
looked
back
what
had
happened
met
his
eyes
as
a
composed
picture
a
picture
of
which
the
subject
was
inveterately
julia
and
her
ponies
julia
wonderfully
fair
and
fine
waving
her
whip
cleaving
the
crowd
holding
her
head
as
if
it
had
been
a
banner
smiling
up
into
windows
carrying
him
beside
her
carrying
him
to
his
doom
he
had
not
reckoned
at
the
time
in
the
few
days
how
much
he
had
driven
about
with
her
but
the
image
of
it
was
there
in
his
consulted
conscience
as
well
as
in
a
personal
glow
not
yet
chilled
it
looked
large
as
it
rose
before
him
the
things
his
mother
had
said
to
him
made
a
rich
enough
frame
for
it
all
and
the
whole
impression
had
that
night
kept
him
much
awake
xv
while
after
leaving
gresham
he
was
hesitating
which
way
to
go
and
was
on
the
point
of
hailing
a
gardener
to
ask
if
dallow
had
been
seen
he
noticed
as
a
spot
of
colour
in
an
expanse
of
shrubbery
a
parasol
moving
in
the
direction
of
the
lake
he
took
his
course
toward
it
across
the
park
and
as
the
bearer
of
the
parasol
strolled
slowly
it
was
not
five
minutes
before
he
had
joined
her
he
went
to
her
soundlessly
on
the
grass
he
had
been
whistling
at
first
but
as
he
got
nearer
stopped
and
it
was
not
till
he
was
at
hand
that
she
looked
round
he
had
watched
her
go
as
if
she
were
turning
things
over
in
her
mind
while
she
brushed
the
smooth
walks
and
the
clean
turf
with
her
dress
slowly
made
her
parasol
revolve
on
her
shoulder
and
carried
in
the
other
hand
a
book
which
he
perceived
to
be
a
monthly
review
i
came
out
to
get
away
she
said
when
he
had
begun
to
walk
with
her
away
from
me
ah
that
impossible
then
she
added
the
day
so
very
nice
lovely
weather
nick
dropped
you
want
to
get
away
from
gresham
i
suppose
she
had
a
pause
from
everything
well
i
want
to
get
away
too
it
has
been
such
a
racket
listen
to
the
dear
birds
yes
our
noise
is
so
good
as
theirs
said
nick
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
married
and
had
shoes
and
rice
thrown
after
me
he
went
on
but
not
to
you
julia
nothing
so
good
as
that
julia
made
no
reply
she
only
turned
her
eyes
on
the
ornamental
water
stretching
away
at
their
right
in
a
moment
she
exclaimed
how
nasty
the
lake
looks
and
nick
recognised
in
her
tone
a
sign
of
that
odd
shyness
a
perverse
stiffness
at
a
moment
when
she
probably
but
wanted
to
be
soft
which
taken
in
combination
with
her
other
qualities
was
so
far
from
being
displeasing
to
him
that
it
represented
her
nearest
approach
to
extreme
charm
was
not
shy
now
for
he
considered
this
morning
that
he
saw
things
very
straight
and
in
a
sense
altogether
superior
and
delightful
this
enabled
him
to
be
generously
sorry
for
his
companion
if
he
were
the
reason
of
her
being
in
any
degree
uncomfortable
and
yet
left
him
to
enjoy
some
of
the
motions
not
in
themselves
without
grace
by
which
her
discomfort
was
revealed
he
would
insist
on
anything
yet
so
he
observed
that
her
standard
in
lakes
was
too
high
and
then
talked
a
little
about
his
mother
and
the
girls
their
having
gone
home
his
not
having
seen
them
that
morning
lady
agnes
deep
satisfaction
in
his
victory
and
the
fact
that
she
would
be
obliged
to
do
something
for
the
autumn
take
a
house
or
something
or
other
i
lend
her
a
house
said
dallow
oh
julia
julia
nick
half
groaned
but
she
paid
no
attention
to
his
sound
she
only
held
up
her
review
and
said
see
what
i
brought
with
me
to
read
hoppus
article
that
right
then
sha
have
to
you
tell
me
about
it
he
uttered
this
without
believing
she
had
meant
or
wished
to
read
the
article
which
was
entitled
the
revision
of
the
british
constitution
in
spite
of
her
having
encumbered
herself
with
the
stiff
fresh
magazine
he
was
deeply
aware
she
was
not
in
want
of
such
inward
occupation
as
periodical
literature
could
supply
they
walked
along
and
he
added
but
is
that
what
we
in
for
reading
hoppus
is
it
the
sort
of
thing
constituents
expect
or
even
worse
pretending
to
have
read
him
when
one
has
oh
what
a
tangled
web
we
weave
people
are
talking
about
it
one
has
to
know
it
the
article
of
the
month
nick
looked
at
her
askance
you
say
things
every
now
and
then
for
which
i
could
really
kill
you
article
of
the
month
for
instance
i
could
kill
you
for
that
well
kill
me
dallow
returned
let
me
carry
your
book
he
went
on
irrelevantly
the
hand
in
which
she
held
it
was
on
the
side
of
her
on
which
he
was
walking
and
he
put
out
his
own
hand
to
take
it
but
for
a
couple
of
minutes
she
forbore
to
give
it
up
so
that
they
held
it
together
swinging
it
a
little
before
she
surrendered
it
he
asked
where
she
was
going
to
the
island
she
answered
well
i
go
with
you
and
i
kill
you
there
the
things
i
say
are
the
right
things
julia
declared
it
just
the
right
things
that
are
wrong
it
because
you
so
political
nick
too
lightly
explained
it
your
horrible
ambition
the
woman
who
has
a
salon
should
have
read
the
article
of
the
month
see
how
one
dreadful
thing
leads
to
another
there
are
some
things
that
lead
to
nothing
said
dallow
no
doubt
no
doubt
and
how
are
you
going
to
get
over
to
your
island
i
do
know
is
there
a
boat
i
do
know
nick
had
paused
to
look
round
for
the
boat
but
his
hostess
walked
on
without
turning
her
head
can
you
row
he
then
asked
do
you
know
i
can
do
everything
yes
to
be
sure
that
why
i
want
to
kill
you
there
the
boat
shall
you
drown
me
she
asked
oh
let
me
perish
with
you
nick
answered
with
a
sigh
the
boat
had
been
hidden
from
them
by
the
bole
of
a
great
tree
which
rose
from
the
grass
at
the
water
edge
it
was
moored
to
a
small
place
of
embarkation
and
was
large
enough
to
hold
as
many
persons
as
were
likely
to
wish
to
visit
at
once
the
little
temple
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
which
nick
liked
because
it
was
absurd
and
which
dallow
had
never
had
a
particular
esteem
for
the
lake
fed
by
a
natural
spring
was
a
liberal
sheet
of
water
measured
by
the
scale
of
park
scenery
and
though
its
principal
merit
was
that
taken
at
a
distance
it
gave
a
gleam
of
abstraction
to
the
concrete
verdure
doing
the
office
of
an
open
eye
in
a
dull
face
it
could
also
be
approached
without
derision
on
a
sweet
summer
morning
when
it
made
a
lapping
sound
and
reflected
candidly
various
things
that
were
probably
finer
than
itself
the
sky
the
great
trees
the
flight
of
birds
a
man
of
taste
coming
back
from
rome
a
hundred
years
before
had
caused
a
small
ornamental
structure
to
be
raised
from
artificial
foundations
on
its
bosom
and
had
endeavoured
to
make
this
architectural
pleasantry
as
nearly
as
possible
a
reminiscence
of
the
small
ruined
rotunda
which
stands
on
the
bank
of
the
tiber
and
is
pronounced
by
once
sacred
to
vesta
it
was
circular
roofed
with
old
tiles
surrounded
by
white
columns
and
considerably
dilapidated
george
dallow
had
taken
an
interest
in
it
it
reminded
him
not
in
the
least
of
rome
but
of
other
things
he
liked
and
had
amused
himself
with
restoring
it
give
me
your
hand
sit
there
and
i
ferry
you
nick
said
julia
complied
placing
herself
opposite
him
in
the
boat
but
as
he
took
up
the
paddles
she
declared
that
she
preferred
to
remain
on
the
water
there
was
too
much
malice
prepense
in
the
temple
he
asked
her
what
she
meant
by
that
and
she
said
it
was
ridiculous
to
withdraw
to
an
island
a
few
feet
square
on
purpose
to
meditate
she
had
nothing
to
meditate
about
that
required
so
much
scenery
and
attitude
on
the
contrary
it
would
be
just
to
change
the
scene
and
the
it
what
we
have
been
doing
for
a
week
that
attitude
and
to
be
for
half
an
hour
where
nobody
looking
and
one
has
to
keep
it
up
is
just
what
i
wanted
to
put
in
an
idle
irresponsible
day
for
i
not
keeping
it
up
now
i
suppose
you
noticed
nick
went
on
as
they
floated
and
he
scarcely
dipped
the
oars
i
do
understand
you
and
julia
leaned
back
in
the
boat
he
gave
no
further
explanation
than
to
ask
in
a
minute
have
you
people
to
dinner
i
believe
there
are
three
or
four
but
i
put
them
off
if
you
like
must
you
live
in
public
julia
he
continued
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
he
could
see
how
she
coloured
we
go
home
i
put
them
off
ah
no
do
go
home
it
too
jolly
here
let
them
come
let
them
come
poor
wretches
how
little
you
know
me
julia
presently
broke
out
when
ever
so
many
times
i
lived
here
for
months
without
a
creature
except
gresham
i
suppose
i
have
had
to
have
the
house
going
i
admit
you
perfect
you
admirable
and
i
do
criticise
you
i
do
understand
you
she
tossed
back
that
only
adds
to
the
generosity
of
what
you
done
for
me
nick
returned
beginning
to
pull
faster
he
bent
over
the
oars
and
sent
the
boat
forward
keeping
this
up
for
a
succession
of
minutes
during
which
they
both
remained
silent
his
companion
in
her
place
motionless
reclining
the
seat
in
the
stern
was
most
comfortable
looked
only
at
the
water
the
sky
the
trees
at
last
he
headed
for
the
little
temple
saying
first
however
sha
we
visit
the
ruin
if
you
like
i
do
mind
seeing
how
they
keep
it
they
reached
the
white
steps
leading
up
to
it
he
held
the
boat
and
his
companion
got
out
then
when
he
had
made
it
fast
they
mounted
together
to
the
open
door
they
keep
the
place
very
well
nick
said
looking
round
it
a
capital
place
to
give
up
everything
in
it
might
do
at
least
for
you
to
explain
what
you
mean
and
julia
sat
down
i
mean
to
pretend
for
half
an
hour
that
i
do
represent
the
burgesses
of
harsh
it
charming
it
very
delicate
work
surely
it
has
been
retouched
the
interior
of
the
pavilion
lighted
by
windows
which
the
circle
of
columns
was
supposed
outside
and
at
a
distance
to
conceal
had
a
vaulted
ceiling
and
was
occupied
by
a
few
pieces
of
furniture
spare
and
faded
of
which
the
colours
matched
with
the
decoration
of
the
walls
these
and
the
ceiling
tinted
and
not
exempt
from
indications
of
damp
were
covered
with
fine
mouldings
and
medallions
it
all
made
a
very
elegant
little
the
mistress
of
which
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
sofa
rolling
her
parasol
and
remarking
you
ought
to
read
hoppus
article
to
me
why
is
your
salon
nick
smiled
what
makes
you
always
talk
of
that
my
salon
an
invention
of
your
own
but
is
it
the
idea
you
most
working
for
suddenly
nervously
she
put
up
her
parasol
and
sat
under
it
as
if
not
quite
sensible
of
what
she
was
doing
how
much
you
know
me
i
not
for
anything
that
you
ever
guess
nick
wandered
about
the
room
and
looked
at
various
things
it
contained
the
odd
volumes
on
the
tables
the
bits
of
quaint
china
on
the
shelves
they
do
keep
it
very
well
you
got
charming
things
they
supposed
to
come
over
every
day
and
look
after
them
they
must
come
over
in
force
oh
no
one
knows
it
spick
and
span
how
well
you
have
everything
done
i
think
you
some
reason
to
say
so
said
dallow
her
parasol
was
now
down
and
she
was
again
rolling
it
tight
but
you
right
about
my
not
knowing
you
why
were
you
so
ready
to
do
so
much
for
me
he
stopped
in
front
of
her
and
she
looked
up
at
him
her
eyes
rested
long
on
his
own
then
she
broke
out
why
do
you
hate
me
so
was
it
because
you
like
me
personally
nick
pursued
as
if
he
heard
her
you
may
think
that
an
odd
or
positively
an
odious
question
but
is
it
natural
my
wanting
to
know
oh
if
you
do
know
julia
quite
desperately
sighed
it
a
question
of
being
sure
well
then
if
you
not
sure
was
it
done
for
me
as
a
friend
as
a
man
you
not
a
man
you
a
child
his
hostess
declared
with
a
face
that
was
cold
though
she
had
been
smiling
the
moment
before
after
all
i
was
a
good
candidate
nick
went
on
what
do
i
care
for
candidates
you
the
most
delightful
woman
julia
he
said
as
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
i
ca
imagine
what
you
mean
by
my
hating
you
if
you
have
discovered
that
i
like
you
you
might
as
well
might
as
well
discover
it
she
was
grave
he
had
never
seen
her
so
pale
and
never
so
beautiful
she
had
stopped
rolling
her
parasol
her
hands
were
folded
in
her
lap
and
her
eyes
bent
on
them
nick
sat
looking
at
them
as
well
a
trifle
awkwardly
might
as
well
have
hated
me
she
said
we
got
on
so
beautifully
together
all
these
days
why
should
we
get
on
as
well
for
ever
and
ever
he
brought
out
she
made
no
answer
and
suddenly
he
said
ah
julia
i
do
know
what
you
done
to
me
but
you
done
it
you
done
it
by
strange
ways
but
it
will
serve
yes
i
hate
you
he
added
in
a
different
tone
and
with
his
face
all
nearer
dear
nick
dear
nick
she
began
but
she
stopped
feeling
his
nearness
and
its
intensity
a
nearness
now
so
great
that
his
arm
was
round
her
that
he
was
really
in
possession
of
her
she
closed
her
eyes
but
heard
him
ask
again
why
should
it
be
for
ever
for
ever
in
a
voice
that
had
for
her
ear
a
vibration
none
had
ever
had
you
done
it
you
done
it
nick
repeated
what
do
you
want
of
me
she
appealed
to
stay
with
me
this
way
always
ah
not
this
way
she
answered
softly
but
as
if
in
pain
and
making
an
effort
with
a
certain
force
to
detach
herself
this
way
then
or
this
he
took
such
pressing
advantage
of
her
that
he
had
kissed
her
with
repetition
she
rose
while
he
insisted
but
he
held
her
yet
and
as
he
did
so
his
tenderness
turned
to
beautiful
words
if
you
marry
me
why
should
it
be
so
simple
so
right
and
good
he
drew
her
closer
again
too
close
for
her
to
answer
but
her
struggle
ceased
and
she
rested
on
him
a
minute
she
buried
her
face
in
his
breast
you
hard
and
it
cruel
she
then
exclaimed
shaking
herself
free
hard
cruel
you
do
it
with
so
little
and
with
this
unexpectedly
to
nick
julia
burst
straight
into
tears
before
he
could
stop
her
she
was
at
the
door
of
the
pavilion
as
if
she
wished
to
get
immediately
away
there
however
he
stayed
her
bending
over
her
while
she
sobbed
unspeakably
gentle
with
her
so
little
it
with
everything
with
everything
i
have
i
done
it
you
say
what
do
you
accuse
me
of
doing
her
tears
were
already
over
of
making
me
yours
of
being
so
precious
julia
so
exactly
what
a
man
wants
as
it
seems
to
me
i
did
know
you
could
he
went
on
smiling
down
at
her
i
did
no
i
did
it
what
i
say
that
you
always
hated
me
i
make
it
up
to
you
he
laughed
she
leaned
on
the
doorway
with
her
forehead
against
the
lintel
you
do
even
deny
it
contradict
you
i
admit
it
though
it
rubbish
on
purpose
to
live
it
down
it
does
matter
she
said
slowly
for
however
much
you
might
have
liked
me
you
never
have
done
so
half
as
much
as
i
cared
for
you
oh
i
so
poor
nick
murmured
cheerfully
with
her
eyes
looking
at
him
as
in
a
new
light
she
slowly
shook
her
head
then
she
declared
you
never
can
live
it
down
i
like
that
have
i
asked
you
to
marry
me
when
did
you
ever
ask
me
every
day
of
my
life
as
i
say
it
hard
for
a
proud
woman
yes
you
too
proud
even
to
answer
me
we
must
think
of
it
we
must
talk
of
it
think
of
it
i
thought
of
it
ever
so
much
i
mean
together
there
are
many
things
in
such
a
question
the
principal
thing
is
beautifully
to
give
me
your
word
she
looked
at
him
afresh
all
strangely
then
she
threw
off
i
wish
i
did
adore
you
she
went
straight
down
the
steps
you
do
adore
me
at
all
you
know
if
you
leave
me
now
why
do
you
go
it
so
charming
here
and
we
so
delightfully
alone
untie
the
boat
we
go
on
the
water
julia
said
nick
was
at
the
top
of
the
steps
looking
down
at
her
ah
stay
a
little
stay
he
pleaded
i
get
in
myself
i
pull
off
she
simply
answered
at
this
he
came
down
and
bent
a
little
to
undo
the
rope
he
was
close
to
her
and
as
he
raised
his
head
he
felt
it
caught
she
had
seized
it
in
her
hands
and
she
pressed
her
lips
as
he
had
never
felt
lips
pressed
to
the
first
place
they
encountered
the
next
instant
she
was
in
the
boat
this
time
he
dipped
the
oars
very
slowly
indeed
and
while
for
a
period
that
was
longer
than
it
seemed
to
them
they
floated
vaguely
they
mainly
sat
and
glowed
at
each
other
as
if
everything
had
been
settled
there
were
reasons
enough
why
nick
should
be
happy
but
it
is
a
singular
fact
that
the
leading
one
was
the
sense
of
his
having
escaped
a
great
and
ugly
mistake
the
final
result
of
his
mother
appeal
to
him
the
day
before
had
been
the
idea
that
he
must
act
with
unimpeachable
honour
he
was
capable
of
taking
it
as
an
assurance
that
julia
had
placed
him
under
an
obligation
a
gentleman
could
regard
but
in
one
way
if
she
herself
had
understood
it
so
putting
the
vision
or
at
any
rate
the
appreciation
of
a
closer
tie
into
everything
she
had
done
for
him
the
case
was
conspicuously
simple
and
his
course
unmistakably
plain
that
is
why
he
had
been
gay
when
he
came
out
of
the
house
to
look
for
her
he
could
be
gay
when
his
course
was
plain
he
could
be
all
the
gayer
naturally
i
must
add
that
in
turning
things
over
as
he
had
done
half
the
night
what
he
had
turned
up
oftenest
was
the
recognition
that
julia
now
had
a
new
personal
power
with
him
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
she
had
thrown
herself
personally
into
his
life
she
had
by
her
act
made
him
live
twice
as
intensely
and
such
an
office
such
a
service
if
a
man
had
accepted
and
deeply
tasted
it
was
certainly
a
thing
to
put
him
on
his
honour
he
took
it
as
distinct
that
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
in
preference
that
would
be
spoiled
for
him
by
any
deflexion
from
that
point
his
mother
had
made
him
uncomfortable
by
bringing
it
so
heavily
up
that
julia
was
in
love
with
him
he
did
like
in
general
to
be
told
such
things
but
the
responsibility
seemed
easier
to
carry
and
he
was
less
shy
about
it
when
once
he
was
away
from
other
eyes
with
only
julia
own
to
express
that
truth
and
with
indifferent
nature
all
about
besides
what
discovery
had
he
made
this
morning
but
that
he
also
was
in
love
you
got
to
be
a
very
great
man
you
know
she
said
to
him
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
i
do
know
what
you
mean
about
my
salon
but
i
ambitious
we
must
look
at
life
in
a
large
bold
way
he
concurred
while
he
rested
his
oars
that
what
i
mean
if
i
did
think
you
could
i
would
look
at
you
i
could
what
do
everything
you
ought
everything
i
imagine
i
dream
of
you
clever
you
can
never
make
me
believe
the
contrary
after
your
speech
on
tuesday
do
speak
to
me
i
seen
i
heard
and
i
know
what
in
you
i
shall
hold
you
to
it
you
everything
you
pretend
not
to
be
nick
looked
at
the
water
while
she
talked
will
it
always
be
so
amusing
he
asked
will
what
always
be
why
my
career
sha
i
make
it
so
then
it
will
be
yours
it
wo
be
mine
said
nick
ah
do
say
that
do
make
me
out
that
sort
of
woman
if
they
should
say
it
me
i
drown
myself
if
they
should
say
what
you
why
your
getting
on
if
they
should
say
i
push
you
and
do
things
for
you
things
i
mean
that
you
ca
do
yourself
well
wo
you
do
them
it
just
what
i
count
on
do
be
dreadful
julia
said
it
would
be
loathsome
if
i
were
thought
the
cleverest
that
not
the
sort
of
man
i
want
to
marry
oh
i
shall
make
you
work
my
dear
ah
she
sounded
in
a
tone
that
might
come
back
to
a
man
after
years
you
do
the
great
thing
you
make
my
life
the
best
life
nick
brought
out
as
if
he
had
been
touched
to
deep
conviction
i
daresay
that
will
keep
me
in
heart
in
heart
why
should
you
be
in
heart
and
her
eyes
lingering
on
him
searching
him
seemed
to
question
him
still
more
than
her
lips
oh
it
will
be
all
right
he
made
answer
you
like
success
as
well
as
any
one
else
do
tell
me
you
not
so
ethereal
yes
i
shall
like
success
so
shall
i
and
of
course
i
glad
you
now
be
able
to
do
things
julia
went
on
i
glad
you
have
things
i
glad
i
not
poor
ah
do
speak
of
that
nick
murmured
only
be
nice
to
my
mother
we
shall
make
her
supremely
happy
it
would
be
for
your
mother
i
do
it
yet
i
glad
i
like
your
people
dallow
rectified
leave
them
to
me
you
generous
you
noble
he
stammered
your
mother
must
live
at
broadwood
she
must
have
it
for
life
it
not
at
all
bad
ah
julia
her
companion
replied
it
well
i
love
you
why
should
you
she
laughed
and
after
this
no
more
was
said
between
them
till
the
boat
touched
shore
when
she
had
got
out
she
recalled
that
it
was
time
for
luncheon
but
they
took
no
action
in
consequence
strolling
in
a
direction
which
was
not
that
of
the
house
there
was
a
vista
that
drew
them
on
a
grassy
path
skirting
the
foundations
of
scattered
beeches
and
leading
to
a
stile
from
which
the
charmed
wanderer
might
drop
into
another
division
of
property
she
said
something
about
their
going
as
far
as
the
stile
then
the
next
instant
exclaimed
how
stupid
of
you
you
forgotten
mr
hoppus
nick
wondered
we
left
him
in
the
temple
of
vesta
darling
i
had
other
things
to
think
of
there
i
send
for
him
said
julia
lord
can
you
think
of
him
now
he
asked
of
course
i
can
more
than
ever
shall
we
go
back
for
him
and
he
pulled
up
she
made
no
direct
answer
but
continued
to
walk
saying
they
would
go
as
far
as
the
stile
of
course
i
know
you
fearfully
vague
she
presently
resumed
i
was
vague
at
all
but
you
were
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
away
it
does
signify
i
another
at
home
another
he
more
lightly
suggested
a
copy
of
mr
hoppus
mercy
how
you
go
in
for
him
fancy
having
two
he
sent
me
the
number
of
the
magazine
and
the
other
the
one
that
comes
every
month
every
month
i
see
but
his
manner
justified
considerably
her
charge
of
vagueness
they
had
reached
the
stile
and
he
leaned
over
it
looking
at
a
great
mild
meadow
and
at
the
browsing
beasts
in
the
distance
did
you
suppose
they
come
every
day
julia
went
on
dear
no
thank
god
they
remained
there
a
little
he
continued
to
look
at
the
animals
and
before
long
added
delightful
english
pastoral
scene
why
do
they
say
it
wo
paint
who
says
it
wo
i
do
know
some
of
them
it
will
in
france
but
somehow
it
here
what
are
you
talking
about
dallow
demanded
he
appeared
unable
to
satisfy
her
on
this
point
instead
of
answering
her
directly
he
at
any
rate
said
is
broadwood
very
charming
have
you
never
been
there
it
shows
how
you
treated
me
we
used
to
go
there
in
august
george
had
ideas
about
it
she
added
she
had
never
affected
not
to
speak
of
her
late
husband
especially
with
nick
whose
kinsman
he
had
in
a
manner
been
and
who
had
liked
him
better
than
some
others
did
george
had
ideas
about
a
great
many
things
yet
she
appeared
conscious
it
would
be
rather
odd
on
such
an
occasion
to
take
this
up
it
was
even
odd
in
nick
to
have
said
it
broadwood
just
right
she
returned
at
last
it
neither
too
small
nor
too
big
and
it
takes
care
of
itself
there
nothing
to
be
done
you
ca
spend
a
penny
and
do
you
want
to
use
it
we
can
go
and
stay
with
said
julia
they
think
i
bring
them
an
angel
and
nick
covered
her
white
hand
which
was
resting
on
the
stile
with
his
own
large
one
as
they
regard
you
yourself
as
an
angel
they
take
it
as
natural
of
you
to
associate
with
your
kind
oh
kind
he
quite
wailed
looking
at
the
cows
but
his
very
extravagance
perhaps
saved
it
and
she
turned
away
from
him
as
if
starting
homeward
while
he
began
to
retrace
his
steps
with
her
suddenly
she
said
what
did
you
mean
that
night
in
paris
that
night
when
you
came
to
the
hotel
with
me
after
we
had
all
dined
at
that
place
with
peter
what
did
i
mean
about
your
caring
so
much
for
the
fine
arts
you
seemed
to
want
to
frighten
me
why
should
you
have
been
frightened
i
ca
imagine
what
i
had
in
my
head
not
now
you
vague
said
julia
with
a
little
flush
not
about
the
great
thing
the
great
thing
that
i
owe
you
everything
an
honest
man
has
to
offer
how
can
i
care
about
the
fine
arts
now
she
stopped
with
lighted
eyes
on
him
is
it
because
you
think
you
it
and
she
paused
still
with
the
heightened
colour
in
her
cheek
then
went
on
that
you
spoken
to
me
as
you
did
there
she
tossed
her
head
toward
the
lake
i
think
i
spoke
to
you
because
i
could
help
it
you
vague
and
she
walked
on
again
you
affect
me
differently
from
any
other
woman
oh
other
women
why
should
you
care
about
the
fine
arts
now
she
added
there
be
no
time
all
my
days
and
my
years
will
be
none
too
much
for
what
you
expect
of
me
i
do
expect
you
to
give
up
anything
i
only
expect
you
to
do
more
to
do
more
i
must
do
less
i
no
talent
no
talent
i
mean
for
painting
julia
pulled
up
again
that
odious
you
you
must
he
burst
out
laughing
you
altogether
delightful
but
how
little
you
know
about
it
about
the
honourable
practice
of
any
art
what
do
you
call
practice
you
have
all
our
things
you
live
in
the
midst
of
them
certainly
i
shall
enjoy
looking
at
them
being
so
near
them
do
say
i
taken
you
away
then
taken
me
away
from
the
love
of
art
i
like
them
myself
now
poor
george
treasures
i
did
of
old
so
much
because
it
seemed
to
me
he
made
too
much
of
them
he
was
always
talking
well
i
wo
always
talk
said
nick
you
may
do
as
you
like
they
yours
give
them
to
the
nation
nick
went
on
i
like
that
when
we
done
with
them
we
shall
have
done
with
them
when
your
vandykes
and
moronis
have
cured
me
of
the
delusion
that
i
may
be
of
family
surely
that
take
long
you
shall
paint
said
julia
never
never
never
he
spoke
in
a
tone
that
made
his
companion
stare
then
seemed
slightly
embarrassed
at
this
result
of
his
emphasis
to
relieve
himself
he
said
as
they
had
come
back
to
the
place
beside
the
lake
where
the
boat
was
moored
sha
we
really
go
and
fetch
mr
hoppus
she
hesitated
you
may
go
i
wo
please
that
not
what
i
want
oblige
me
by
going
i
wait
here
with
which
she
sat
down
on
the
bench
attached
to
the
little
landing
nick
at
this
got
into
the
boat
and
put
off
he
smiled
at
her
as
she
sat
there
watching
him
he
made
his
short
journey
disembarked
and
went
into
the
pavilion
but
when
he
came
out
with
the
object
of
his
errand
he
saw
she
had
quitted
her
station
had
returned
to
the
house
without
him
he
rowed
back
quickly
sprang
ashore
and
followed
her
with
long
steps
apparently
she
had
gone
fast
she
had
almost
reached
the
door
when
he
overtook
her
why
did
you
basely
desert
me
he
asked
tenderly
stopping
her
there
i
do
know
because
i
so
happy
may
i
tell
mother
then
you
may
tell
her
she
shall
have
broadwood
xvi
he
lost
no
time
in
going
down
to
see
carteret
to
whom
he
had
written
immediately
after
the
election
and
who
had
answered
him
in
twelve
revised
pages
of
historical
parallel
he
used
often
to
envy
carteret
leisure
a
sense
of
which
came
to
him
now
afresh
in
the
summer
evening
as
he
walked
up
the
hill
toward
the
quiet
house
where
enjoyment
had
ever
been
mingled
for
him
with
a
vague
oppression
he
was
a
little
boy
again
under
carteret
roof
a
little
boy
on
whom
it
had
been
duly
impressed
that
in
the
wide
plain
peaceful
rooms
he
was
not
to
touch
when
he
paid
a
visit
to
his
father
old
friend
there
were
in
fact
many
things
many
topics
from
which
he
instinctively
kept
his
hands
even
chayter
the
immemorial
blank
butler
who
was
so
like
his
master
that
he
might
have
been
a
twin
brother
helped
to
remind
him
that
he
must
be
good
carteret
seemed
to
nick
a
very
grave
person
but
he
had
the
sense
that
chayter
thought
him
rather
frivolous
our
young
man
always
came
on
foot
from
the
station
leaving
his
portmanteau
to
be
carried
the
direct
way
was
steep
and
he
liked
the
slow
approach
which
gave
him
a
chance
to
look
about
the
place
and
smell
the
hay
at
this
season
the
air
was
full
of
it
the
fields
were
so
near
that
it
was
in
the
clean
still
streets
nick
would
never
have
thought
of
rattling
up
to
carteret
door
which
had
on
an
old
brass
plate
the
proprietor
name
as
if
he
had
been
the
principal
surgeon
the
house
was
in
the
high
part
and
the
neat
roofs
of
other
houses
lower
down
the
hill
made
an
immediate
prospect
for
it
scarcely
counting
however
since
the
green
country
was
just
below
these
familiar
and
interpenetrating
in
the
shape
of
small
but
gardens
free
flourished
in
all
the
intervals
but
the
only
disorder
of
the
place
was
that
there
were
sometimes
oats
on
the
pavements
a
crooked
lane
with
postern
doors
and
opened
near
carteret
house
and
wandered
toward
the
old
abbey
for
the
abbey
was
the
secondary
fact
of
beauclere
it
came
after
carteret
carteret
sometimes
went
away
and
the
abbey
never
did
yet
somehow
what
was
most
of
the
essence
of
the
place
was
that
it
could
boast
of
the
resident
in
the
squarest
of
the
square
red
houses
the
one
with
the
finest
of
the
arched
in
three
divisions
over
the
widest
of
the
doorways
you
saw
the
great
church
from
the
doorstep
beyond
gardens
of
course
and
in
the
stillness
you
could
hear
the
flutter
of
the
birds
that
circled
round
its
huge
short
towers
the
towers
had
been
finished
only
as
time
finishes
things
by
lending
assurances
to
their
lapses
there
is
something
right
in
old
monuments
that
have
been
wrong
for
centuries
some
such
moral
as
that
was
usually
in
nick
mind
as
an
emanation
of
beauclere
when
he
saw
the
grand
line
of
the
roof
ride
the
sky
and
draw
out
its
length
when
the
door
with
the
brass
plate
was
opened
and
chayter
appeared
in
the
middle
distance
he
always
advanced
just
to
the
same
spot
as
a
prime
minister
receives
an
ambassador
nick
felt
anew
that
he
would
be
wonderfully
like
carteret
if
he
had
had
an
expression
he
denied
himself
this
freedom
never
giving
a
sign
of
recognition
often
as
the
young
man
had
been
at
the
house
he
was
most
attentive
to
the
wants
but
apparently
feared
that
if
he
allowed
a
familiarity
it
might
go
too
far
there
was
always
the
same
question
to
be
asked
had
carteret
finished
his
nap
he
usually
had
not
finished
it
and
this
left
nick
what
he
liked
time
to
smoke
a
cigarette
in
the
garden
or
even
to
take
before
dinner
a
turn
about
the
place
he
observed
now
every
time
he
came
that
carteret
nap
lasted
a
little
longer
there
was
each
year
a
little
more
strength
to
be
gathered
for
the
ceremony
of
dinner
this
was
the
principal
symptom
almost
the
only
one
that
the
old
gentleman
gave
of
not
being
so
fresh
as
of
yore
he
was
still
wonderful
for
his
age
he
was
particularly
careful
chayter
went
so
far
as
to
mention
to
nick
that
four
gentlemen
were
expected
to
dinner
an
exuberance
perhaps
partly
explained
by
the
circumstance
that
lord
bottomley
was
one
of
them
the
prospect
of
lord
bottomley
was
somehow
not
stirring
it
only
made
the
young
man
say
to
himself
with
a
quick
thin
sigh
this
time
i
in
for
it
and
he
immediately
had
the
unpolitical
sense
again
that
there
was
nothing
so
pleasant
as
the
way
the
quiet
bachelor
house
had
its
best
rooms
on
the
big
garden
which
seemed
to
advance
into
them
through
their
wide
windows
and
ruralise
their
dulness
i
expect
it
will
be
a
lateish
eight
sir
said
chayter
superintending
in
the
library
the
production
of
tea
on
a
large
scale
everything
at
carteret
seemed
to
nick
on
a
larger
scale
than
anywhere
else
the
the
knives
and
forks
the
the
the
legs
of
mutton
the
candles
and
the
lumps
of
coal
they
represented
and
apparently
exhausted
the
master
sense
of
pleasing
effect
for
the
house
was
not
otherwise
decorated
nick
thought
it
really
hideous
but
he
was
capable
at
any
time
of
extracting
a
degree
of
amusement
from
anything
strongly
characteristic
and
interior
expressed
a
whole
view
of
life
our
young
man
was
generous
enough
to
find
in
it
a
hundred
instructive
intimations
even
while
it
came
over
him
as
it
always
did
at
beauclere
that
this
was
the
view
he
himself
was
expected
to
take
nowhere
were
the
boiled
eggs
at
breakfast
so
big
or
in
such
big
receptacles
his
own
shoes
arranged
in
his
room
looked
to
him
vaster
there
than
at
home
he
went
out
into
the
garden
and
remembered
what
enormous
strawberries
they
should
have
for
dinner
in
the
house
was
a
great
deal
of
landseer
of
oilcloth
of
woodwork
painted
and
grained
finding
there
would
be
time
before
the
evening
meal
or
before
carteret
was
likely
to
see
him
he
quitted
the
house
and
took
a
stroll
toward
the
abbey
it
covered
acres
of
ground
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
and
there
were
aspects
in
which
its
vast
bulk
reminded
him
of
the
ark
left
high
and
dry
upon
ararat
it
was
the
image
at
least
of
a
great
wreck
of
the
indestructible
vessel
of
a
faith
washed
up
there
by
a
storm
centuries
before
the
injury
of
time
added
to
this
appearance
the
infirmities
round
which
as
he
knew
the
battle
of
restoration
had
begun
to
be
fought
the
cry
had
been
raised
to
save
the
splendid
pile
and
the
by
the
purists
the
sentimentalists
whatever
they
were
to
save
it
from
being
saved
they
were
all
exchanging
compliments
in
the
morning
papers
nick
sauntered
about
the
church
it
took
a
good
while
he
leaned
against
low
things
and
looked
up
at
it
while
he
smoked
another
cigarette
it
struck
him
as
a
great
pity
such
a
pile
should
be
touched
so
much
of
the
past
was
buried
there
that
it
was
like
desecrating
like
digging
up
a
grave
since
the
years
were
letting
it
down
so
gently
why
jostle
the
elbow
of
time
the
fading
afternoon
was
exquisitely
pure
the
place
was
empty
he
heard
nothing
but
the
cries
of
several
children
which
sounded
sweet
who
were
playing
on
the
flatness
of
the
very
old
tombs
he
knew
this
would
inevitably
be
one
of
the
topics
at
dinner
the
restoration
of
the
abbey
it
would
give
rise
to
a
considerable
deal
of
orderly
debate
lord
bottomley
oddly
enough
would
probably
oppose
the
expensive
project
but
on
grounds
that
would
be
characteristic
of
him
even
if
the
attitude
were
not
nick
nerves
always
knew
on
this
spot
what
it
was
to
be
soothed
but
he
shifted
his
position
with
a
slight
impatience
as
the
vision
came
over
him
of
lord
bottomley
treating
a
question
of
esthetics
it
was
enough
to
make
one
want
to
take
the
other
side
the
idea
of
having
the
same
taste
as
his
lordship
one
would
have
it
for
such
different
reasons
dear
carteret
would
be
deliberate
and
fair
all
round
and
would
like
his
noble
friend
exhibit
much
more
architectural
knowledge
than
he
nick
possessed
which
would
not
make
it
a
whit
less
droll
to
our
young
man
that
an
artistic
idea
so
little
really
assimilated
should
be
broached
at
that
table
and
in
that
air
it
would
remain
so
outside
of
their
minds
and
their
minds
would
remain
so
outside
of
it
it
would
be
dropped
at
last
however
after
half
an
hour
gentle
worrying
and
the
conversation
would
incline
itself
to
public
affairs
carteret
would
find
his
natural
level
the
production
of
anecdote
in
regard
to
the
formation
of
early
ministries
he
knew
more
than
any
one
else
about
the
personages
of
whom
certain
cabinets
would
have
consisted
if
they
had
not
consisted
of
others
his
favourite
exercise
was
to
illustrate
how
different
everything
might
have
been
from
what
it
was
and
how
the
reason
of
the
difference
had
always
been
somebody
inability
to
see
his
way
to
accept
the
view
of
somebody
else
a
view
usually
at
the
time
discussed
in
strict
confidence
with
carteret
who
surrounded
his
actual
violation
of
that
confidence
thirty
years
later
with
many
precautions
against
scandal
in
this
retrospective
vein
at
the
head
of
his
table
the
old
gentleman
enjoyed
a
hearing
or
at
any
rate
commanded
a
silence
often
intense
every
one
left
it
to
some
one
else
to
ask
another
question
and
when
by
chance
some
one
else
did
so
every
one
was
struck
with
admiration
at
any
one
being
able
to
say
anything
nick
knew
the
moment
when
he
himself
would
take
a
glass
of
a
particular
port
and
surreptitiously
looking
at
his
watch
perceive
it
was
ten
that
timepiece
might
as
well
mark
all
this
would
be
a
part
of
the
suggestion
of
leisure
that
invariably
descended
upon
him
at
beauclere
the
image
of
a
sloping
shore
where
the
tide
of
time
broke
with
a
ripple
too
faint
to
be
a
warning
but
there
was
another
admonition
almost
equally
sure
to
descend
upon
his
spirit
during
a
stroll
in
a
summer
hour
about
the
grand
abbey
to
sink
into
it
as
the
light
lingered
on
the
rough
red
walls
and
the
local
accent
of
the
children
sounded
soft
in
the
churchyard
it
was
simply
the
sense
of
england
a
sort
of
apprehended
revelation
of
his
country
the
dim
annals
of
the
place
were
sensibly
heavily
in
the
air
foundations
bafflingly
early
a
great
monastic
life
wars
of
the
roses
with
battles
and
blood
in
the
streets
and
then
the
long
quietude
of
the
respectable
centuries
all
and
magistrates
and
vicars
and
these
things
were
connected
with
an
emotion
that
arose
from
the
green
country
the
rich
land
so
infinitely
lived
in
and
laid
on
him
a
hand
that
was
too
ghostly
to
press
and
yet
somehow
too
urgent
to
be
light
it
produced
a
throb
he
could
have
spoken
of
it
was
so
deep
and
that
was
half
imagination
and
half
responsibility
these
impressions
melted
together
and
made
a
general
appeal
of
which
with
his
new
honours
as
a
legislator
he
was
the
sentient
subject
if
he
had
a
love
for
that
particular
scene
of
life
might
it
have
a
love
for
him
and
expect
something
of
him
what
fate
could
be
so
high
as
to
grow
old
in
a
national
affection
what
a
fine
sort
of
reciprocity
making
mere
soreness
of
all
the
balms
of
indifference
the
great
church
was
still
open
and
he
turned
into
it
and
wandered
a
little
in
the
twilight
that
had
gathered
earlier
there
the
whole
structure
with
its
immensity
of
height
and
distance
seemed
to
rest
on
tremendous
facts
facts
of
achievement
and
endurance
and
the
huge
norman
pillars
to
loom
through
the
dimness
like
the
ghosts
of
heroes
nick
was
more
struck
with
its
thick
earthly
than
with
its
fine
spiritual
reference
and
he
felt
the
oppression
of
his
conscience
as
he
walked
slowly
about
it
was
in
his
mind
that
nothing
in
life
was
really
clear
all
things
were
mingled
and
charged
and
that
patriotism
might
be
an
uplifting
passion
even
if
it
had
to
allow
for
lord
bottomley
and
for
carteret
blindness
on
certain
sides
he
presently
noticed
that
seven
was
about
to
strike
and
as
he
went
back
to
his
old
friend
he
could
have
said
if
he
walked
in
gladness
or
in
gloom
carteret
will
be
in
the
at
a
quarter
to
eight
sir
chayter
mentioned
and
nick
as
he
went
to
dress
asked
himself
what
was
the
use
of
being
a
member
of
parliament
if
one
was
still
sensitive
to
an
intimation
on
the
part
of
such
a
functionary
that
one
ought
already
to
have
begun
that
business
chayter
words
but
meant
that
carteret
would
expect
to
have
a
little
comfortable
conversation
with
him
before
dinner
nick
usual
rapidity
in
dressing
was
however
quite
adequate
to
the
occasion
so
that
his
host
had
not
appeared
when
he
went
down
there
were
flowers
in
the
unfeminine
saloon
which
contained
several
paintings
in
addition
to
the
engravings
of
pictures
of
animals
but
nothing
could
prevent
its
reminding
nick
of
a
comfortable
carteret
presently
came
in
with
his
stick
a
laugh
like
a
series
of
little
warning
coughs
and
the
air
of
embarrassment
that
our
young
man
always
perceived
in
him
at
first
he
was
almost
eighty
but
was
still
shy
he
laughed
a
great
deal
faintly
and
vaguely
at
nothing
as
if
to
make
up
for
the
seriousness
with
which
he
took
some
jokes
he
always
began
by
looking
away
from
his
interlocutor
and
it
was
only
little
by
little
that
his
eyes
came
round
after
which
their
limpid
and
benevolent
blue
made
you
wonder
why
they
should
ever
be
circumspect
he
was
and
had
a
long
upper
lip
when
he
had
seated
himself
he
talked
of
majorities
and
showed
a
disposition
to
converse
on
the
general
subject
of
the
fluctuation
of
liberal
gains
he
had
an
extraordinary
memory
for
facts
of
this
sort
and
could
mention
the
figures
relating
to
the
returns
from
innumerable
places
in
particular
years
to
many
of
these
facts
he
attached
great
importance
in
his
simple
kindly
presupposing
way
correcting
himself
five
minutes
later
if
he
had
said
that
in
some
one
had
had
instead
of
nick
always
felt
a
great
hypocrite
as
he
listened
to
him
in
spite
of
the
old
man
courtesy
a
thing
so
charming
in
itself
that
it
would
have
been
grossness
to
speak
of
him
as
a
bore
the
difficulty
was
that
he
took
for
granted
all
kinds
of
positive
assent
and
nick
in
such
company
found
himself
steeped
in
an
element
of
tacit
pledges
which
constituted
the
very
medium
of
intercourse
and
yet
made
him
draw
his
breath
a
little
in
pain
when
for
a
moment
he
measured
them
there
would
have
been
no
hypocrisy
at
all
if
he
could
have
regarded
carteret
as
a
mere
sweet
spectacle
the
last
or
almost
the
last
illustration
of
a
departing
tradition
of
manners
but
he
represented
something
more
than
manners
he
represented
what
he
believed
to
be
morals
and
ideas
ideas
as
regards
which
he
took
your
personal
deference
not
discovering
how
natural
that
was
for
participation
nick
liked
to
think
that
his
father
though
ten
years
younger
had
found
it
congruous
to
make
his
best
friend
of
the
owner
of
so
nice
a
nature
it
gave
a
softness
to
his
feeling
for
that
memory
to
be
reminded
that
sir
nicholas
had
been
of
the
same
general
type
a
type
so
pure
so
disinterested
so
concerned
for
the
public
good
just
so
it
endeared
carteret
to
him
to
perceive
that
he
considered
his
father
had
done
a
definite
work
prematurely
interrupted
which
had
been
an
absolute
benefit
to
the
people
of
england
the
oddity
was
however
that
though
both
carteret
aspect
and
his
appreciation
were
still
so
fresh
this
relation
of
his
to
his
late
distinguished
friend
made
the
latter
appear
to
nick
even
more
irrecoverably
dead
the
good
old
man
had
almost
a
vocabulary
of
his
own
made
up
of
political
phrases
and
quite
untainted
with
the
new
terms
mostly
borrowed
from
america
indeed
his
language
and
his
tone
made
those
of
almost
any
one
who
might
be
talking
with
him
sound
by
contrast
rather
american
he
was
at
least
nowadays
never
severe
nor
denunciatory
but
sometimes
in
telling
an
anecdote
he
dropped
such
an
expression
as
the
rascal
said
to
me
or
such
an
epithet
as
the
vulgar
dog
nick
was
always
struck
with
the
rare
simplicity
it
came
out
in
his
countenance
of
one
who
had
lived
so
long
and
seen
so
much
of
affairs
that
draw
forth
the
passions
and
perversities
of
men
it
often
made
him
say
to
himself
that
carteret
must
have
had
many
odd
parts
to
have
been
able
to
achieve
with
his
means
so
many
things
requiring
cleverness
it
was
as
if
experience
though
coming
to
him
in
abundance
had
dealt
with
him
so
as
to
leave
no
stain
and
had
moreover
never
provoked
him
to
any
general
reflexion
he
had
never
proceeded
in
any
ironic
way
from
the
particular
to
the
general
certainly
he
had
never
made
a
reflexion
upon
anything
so
unparliamentary
as
life
he
would
have
questioned
the
taste
of
such
an
extravagance
and
if
he
had
encountered
it
on
the
part
of
another
have
regarded
it
as
an
imported
foreign
toy
with
the
uses
of
which
he
was
unacquainted
life
for
him
was
a
purely
practical
function
not
a
question
of
more
or
less
showy
phrasing
it
must
be
added
that
he
had
to
nick
perception
his
variations
his
back
windows
opening
into
grounds
more
private
that
was
visible
from
the
way
his
eye
grew
cold
and
his
whole
polite
face
rather
austere
when
he
listened
to
something
he
did
agree
with
or
perhaps
even
understand
as
if
his
modesty
did
in
strictness
forbid
the
suspicion
that
a
thing
he
did
understand
would
have
a
probability
against
it
at
such
times
there
was
something
rather
deadly
in
the
silence
in
which
he
simply
waited
with
a
lapse
in
his
face
not
helping
his
interlocutor
out
nick
would
have
been
very
sorry
to
attempt
to
communicate
to
him
a
matter
he
would
be
likely
to
understand
this
cut
off
of
course
a
multitude
of
subjects
the
evening
passed
exactly
as
he
had
foreseen
even
to
the
markedly
prompt
dispersal
of
the
guests
two
of
whom
were
local
men
earnest
and
distinct
though
not
particularly
distinguished
the
third
was
a
young
slim
uninitiated
gentleman
whom
lord
bottomley
brought
with
him
and
concerning
whom
nick
was
informed
beforehand
that
he
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
the
honourable
jane
his
lordship
second
daughter
there
were
recurrent
allusions
to
nick
victory
as
to
which
he
had
the
fear
that
he
might
appear
to
exhibit
less
interest
in
it
than
the
company
did
he
took
energetic
precautions
against
this
and
felt
repeatedly
a
little
spent
with
them
for
the
subject
always
came
up
once
more
yet
it
was
not
as
his
but
as
theirs
that
they
liked
the
triumph
carteret
took
leave
of
him
for
the
night
directly
after
the
other
guests
had
gone
using
at
this
moment
the
words
he
had
often
used
before
you
may
sit
up
to
any
hour
you
like
i
only
ask
that
you
do
read
in
bed
xvii
nick
little
visit
was
to
terminate
immediately
after
luncheon
the
following
day
much
as
the
old
man
enjoyed
his
being
there
he
have
dreamed
of
asking
for
more
of
his
time
now
that
it
had
such
great
public
uses
he
liked
infinitely
better
that
his
young
friend
should
be
occupied
with
parliamentary
work
than
only
occupied
in
talking
it
over
with
him
talking
it
over
however
was
the
next
best
thing
as
on
the
morrow
after
breakfast
carteret
showed
nick
he
considered
they
sat
in
the
garden
the
morning
being
warm
and
the
old
man
had
a
table
beside
him
covered
with
the
letters
and
newspapers
the
post
had
poured
forth
he
was
proud
of
his
correspondence
which
was
altogether
on
public
affairs
and
proud
in
a
manner
of
the
fact
that
he
now
dictated
almost
everything
that
had
more
in
it
of
the
statesman
in
retirement
a
character
indeed
not
consciously
assumed
by
carteret
but
always
tacitly
attributed
to
him
by
nick
who
took
it
rather
from
the
pictorial
point
of
view
remembering
on
each
occasion
only
afterwards
that
though
he
was
in
retirement
he
had
not
exactly
been
a
statesman
a
young
man
a
very
sharp
handy
young
man
came
every
morning
at
ten
and
wrote
for
him
till
luncheon
the
young
man
had
a
holiday
in
honour
of
nick
visit
a
fact
the
mention
of
which
led
nick
to
make
some
not
particularly
sincere
speech
about
being
ready
to
write
anything
if
carteret
were
at
all
pressed
ah
but
your
own
budget
what
will
become
of
that
the
old
gentleman
objected
glancing
at
nick
pockets
as
if
rather
surprised
not
to
see
them
stuffed
out
with
documents
in
split
envelopes
his
visitor
had
to
confess
that
he
had
not
directed
his
letters
to
meet
him
at
beauclere
he
should
find
them
in
town
that
afternoon
this
led
to
a
little
homily
from
carteret
which
made
him
feel
quite
guilty
there
was
such
an
implication
of
neglected
duty
in
the
way
the
old
man
said
you
wo
do
them
justice
you
wo
do
them
justice
he
talked
for
ten
minutes
in
his
rich
simple
urbane
way
about
the
fatal
consequences
of
getting
behind
it
was
his
favourite
doctrine
that
one
should
always
be
a
little
before
and
his
own
eminently
regular
respiration
seemed
to
illustrate
the
idea
a
man
was
certainly
before
who
had
so
much
in
his
rear
this
led
to
the
bestowal
of
a
good
deal
of
general
advice
on
the
mistakes
to
avoid
at
the
beginning
of
a
parliamentary
career
as
to
which
carteret
spoke
with
the
experience
of
one
who
had
sat
for
fifty
years
in
the
house
of
commons
nick
was
amused
but
also
mystified
and
even
a
little
irritated
by
his
talk
it
was
founded
on
the
idea
of
observation
and
yet
our
young
man
could
at
all
regard
him
as
an
observer
he
does
observe
he
said
to
himself
if
he
did
he
would
see
he
would
think
the
end
of
this
private
cogitation
was
a
vague
impatience
of
all
the
things
his
venerable
host
took
for
granted
he
did
see
any
of
the
things
nick
saw
some
of
these
latter
were
the
light
touches
the
summer
morning
scattered
through
the
sweet
old
garden
the
time
passed
there
a
good
deal
as
if
it
were
sitting
still
with
a
plaid
under
its
feet
while
carteret
distilled
a
little
more
of
the
wisdom
he
had
laid
up
in
his
fifty
years
this
immense
term
had
something
fabulous
and
monstrous
for
nick
who
wondered
whether
it
were
the
sort
of
thing
his
companion
supposed
had
gone
in
for
it
was
not
strange
carteret
should
be
different
he
might
originally
have
been
more
well
to
himself
nick
was
not
obliged
to
phrase
it
what
our
young
man
meant
was
more
of
what
it
was
perceptible
to
him
that
his
old
friend
was
not
should
even
he
nick
be
like
that
at
the
end
of
fifty
years
what
carteret
was
so
good
as
to
expect
for
him
was
that
he
should
be
much
more
distinguished
and
would
this
exactly
mean
much
more
like
that
of
course
nick
heard
some
things
he
had
heard
before
as
for
instance
the
circumstances
that
had
originally
led
the
old
man
to
settle
at
beauclere
he
had
been
returned
for
that
borough
it
was
his
second
seat
in
years
far
remote
and
had
come
to
live
there
because
he
then
had
a
conscientious
conviction
modified
indeed
by
later
experience
that
a
member
should
be
constantly
resident
he
spoke
of
this
now
smiling
rosily
as
he
might
have
spoken
of
some
wild
aberration
of
his
youth
yet
he
called
nick
attention
to
the
fact
that
he
still
so
far
clung
to
his
conviction
as
to
hold
though
of
what
might
be
urged
on
the
other
side
he
was
perfectly
aware
that
a
representative
should
at
least
be
as
resident
as
possible
this
gave
nick
an
opening
for
something
that
had
been
on
and
off
his
lips
all
the
morning
according
to
that
i
ought
to
take
up
my
abode
at
harsh
in
the
measure
of
the
convenient
i
should
be
sorry
to
see
you
do
it
it
ought
to
be
rather
convenient
nick
largely
smiled
i
got
a
piece
of
news
for
you
which
i
kept
as
one
keeps
that
sort
of
thing
for
it
very
good
till
the
last
he
waited
a
little
to
see
if
carteret
would
guess
and
at
first
thought
nothing
would
come
of
this
but
after
resting
his
eyes
on
him
for
a
moment
the
old
man
said
i
should
indeed
be
very
happy
to
hear
that
you
arranged
to
take
a
wife
dallow
has
been
so
good
as
to
say
she
marry
me
nick
returned
that
very
suitable
i
should
think
it
would
answer
it
very
jolly
said
nick
it
was
well
carteret
was
not
what
his
guest
called
observant
or
he
might
have
found
a
lower
pitch
in
the
sound
of
this
sentence
than
in
the
sense
your
dear
father
would
have
liked
it
so
my
mother
says
and
must
be
delighted
dallow
do
you
mean
nick
asked
i
was
thinking
of
your
mother
but
i
do
exclude
the
charming
lady
i
remember
her
as
a
little
girl
i
must
have
seen
her
at
windrush
now
i
understand
the
fine
spirit
with
which
she
threw
herself
into
your
canvass
it
was
her
they
elected
said
nick
i
do
know
his
host
went
on
that
i
ever
been
an
enthusiast
for
political
women
but
there
no
doubt
that
in
approaching
the
mass
of
electors
a
graceful
affable
manner
the
manner
of
the
real
english
lady
is
a
force
not
to
be
despised
julia
a
real
english
lady
and
at
the
same
time
a
very
political
woman
nick
remarked
is
it
rather
in
the
family
i
remember
once
going
to
see
her
mother
in
town
and
finding
the
leaders
of
both
parties
sitting
with
her
my
principal
friend
of
the
others
is
her
brother
peter
i
do
think
he
troubles
himself
much
about
that
sort
of
thing
said
nick
what
does
he
trouble
himself
about
carteret
asked
with
a
certain
gravity
he
in
the
diplomatic
service
he
a
secretary
in
paris
that
may
be
serious
said
the
old
man
he
takes
a
great
interest
in
the
theatre
i
suppose
you
say
that
may
be
serious
too
nick
laughed
oh
and
carteret
looked
as
if
he
scarcely
understood
then
he
continued
well
it
ca
hurt
you
it
ca
hurt
me
if
dallow
takes
an
interest
in
your
interests
when
a
man
in
my
situation
he
feels
as
if
nothing
could
hurt
him
i
very
glad
you
happy
said
carteret
he
rested
his
mild
eyes
on
our
young
man
who
had
a
sense
of
seeing
in
them
for
a
moment
the
faint
ghost
of
an
old
story
the
last
strange
flicker
as
from
cold
ashes
of
a
flame
that
had
become
the
memory
of
a
memory
this
glimmer
of
wonder
and
envy
the
revelation
of
a
life
intensely
celibate
was
for
an
instant
infinitely
touching
nick
had
harboured
a
theory
suggested
by
a
vague
allusion
from
his
father
who
had
been
discreet
that
their
benevolent
friend
had
had
in
his
youth
an
unhappy
which
had
led
him
to
forswear
for
ever
the
commerce
of
woman
what
remained
in
him
of
conscious
renunciation
gave
a
throb
as
he
looked
at
his
bright
companion
who
proposed
to
take
the
matter
so
much
the
other
way
good
to
marry
and
i
think
it
right
i
not
done
right
i
know
that
if
she
a
good
woman
it
the
best
thing
carteret
went
on
what
i
been
hoping
for
you
sometimes
i
thought
of
speaking
to
you
she
a
very
good
woman
said
nick
and
i
hope
she
not
poor
carteret
spoke
exactly
with
the
same
blandness
no
indeed
she
rich
her
husband
whom
i
knew
and
liked
left
her
a
large
fortune
and
on
what
terms
does
she
enjoy
it
i
have
the
least
idea
said
nick
carteret
considered
i
see
it
does
concern
you
it
concern
you
he
added
in
a
moment
nick
thought
of
his
mother
at
this
but
he
returned
i
daresay
she
can
do
what
she
likes
with
her
money
so
can
i
my
dear
young
friend
said
carteret
nick
tried
not
to
look
conscious
for
he
felt
a
significance
in
the
old
man
face
he
turned
his
own
everywhere
but
toward
it
thinking
again
of
his
mother
that
must
be
very
pleasant
if
one
has
any
i
wish
you
had
a
little
more
i
do
particularly
care
said
nick
your
marriage
will
assist
you
you
ca
help
that
carteret
declared
but
i
should
like
you
to
be
under
obligations
not
quite
so
heavy
oh
i
so
obliged
to
her
for
caring
for
me
that
the
rest
does
count
certainly
it
nice
of
her
to
like
you
but
why
should
she
other
people
do
some
of
them
make
me
feel
as
if
i
abused
it
said
nick
looking
at
his
host
that
is
they
do
make
me
but
i
feel
it
he
corrected
i
no
son
and
carteret
spoke
as
if
his
companion
might
have
been
sure
sha
you
be
very
kind
to
her
he
pursued
you
gratify
her
ambition
oh
she
thinks
me
cleverer
than
i
am
that
because
she
in
love
the
old
gentleman
hinted
as
if
this
were
very
subtle
however
you
must
be
as
clever
as
we
think
you
if
you
do
prove
so
and
he
paused
with
his
folded
hands
well
if
i
do
asked
nick
oh
it
wo
do
it
wo
do
said
carteret
in
a
tone
his
companion
was
destined
to
remember
afterwards
i
say
i
no
son
he
continued
but
if
i
had
had
one
he
should
have
risen
high
it
well
for
me
such
a
person
does
exist
i
should
easily
have
found
a
wife
he
would
have
gone
to
the
altar
with
a
little
money
in
his
pocket
that
would
have
been
the
least
of
his
advantages
sir
nick
declared
when
are
you
to
be
married
carteret
asked
ah
that
the
question
julia
wo
yet
say
well
said
the
old
man
without
the
least
flourish
you
may
consider
that
when
it
comes
off
i
make
you
a
settlement
i
feel
your
kindness
more
than
i
can
express
nick
replied
but
that
will
probably
be
the
moment
when
i
shall
be
least
conscious
of
wanting
anything
you
appreciate
it
later
you
appreciate
it
very
soon
i
shall
like
you
to
appreciate
it
carteret
went
on
as
if
he
had
a
just
vision
of
the
way
a
young
man
of
a
proper
spirit
should
feel
then
he
added
your
father
would
have
liked
you
to
appreciate
it
poor
father
nick
exclaimed
vaguely
rather
embarrassed
reflecting
on
the
oddity
of
a
position
in
which
the
ground
for
holding
up
his
head
as
the
husband
of
a
rich
woman
would
be
that
he
had
accepted
a
present
of
money
from
another
source
it
was
plain
he
was
not
fated
to
go
in
for
independence
the
most
that
he
could
treat
himself
to
would
be
dependence
that
was
duly
grateful
how
much
do
you
expect
of
me
he
inquired
with
a
grave
face
well
nicholas
only
what
your
father
did
he
so
often
spoke
of
you
i
remember
at
the
last
just
after
you
had
been
with
him
alone
you
know
i
saw
him
then
he
was
greatly
moved
by
his
interview
with
you
and
so
was
i
by
what
he
told
me
of
it
he
said
he
should
live
on
in
you
he
should
work
in
you
it
has
always
given
me
a
special
feeling
if
i
may
use
the
expression
about
you
the
feelings
are
indeed
not
usual
dear
carteret
which
take
so
munificent
a
form
but
you
do
oh
you
do
expect
too
much
nick
brought
himself
to
say
i
expect
you
to
repay
me
the
old
man
returned
gaily
as
for
the
form
i
have
it
in
my
mind
the
form
of
repayment
the
form
of
repayment
ah
do
talk
of
that
now
said
nick
for
you
see
nothing
else
is
settled
no
one
has
been
told
except
my
mother
she
has
only
consented
to
my
telling
you
lady
agnes
do
you
mean
ah
no
dear
mother
would
like
to
publish
it
on
the
she
so
glad
she
wants
us
to
have
it
over
but
julia
herself
nick
explained
wishes
to
wait
therefore
kindly
mention
it
for
the
present
to
no
one
my
dear
boy
there
at
this
rate
nothing
to
mention
what
does
julia
want
to
wait
for
till
i
like
her
better
that
what
she
says
it
the
way
to
make
you
like
her
worse
carteret
knowingly
declared
has
she
your
affection
so
much
so
that
her
delay
makes
me
exceedingly
unhappy
carteret
looked
at
his
young
friend
as
if
he
did
strike
him
as
quite
wretched
but
he
put
the
question
then
what
more
does
she
want
nick
laughed
out
at
this
though
perceiving
his
host
had
meant
it
as
an
epigram
while
the
latter
resumed
i
do
understand
engaged
or
you
not
engaged
she
is
but
i
not
that
what
she
says
about
it
the
trouble
is
she
does
believe
in
me
carteret
shone
with
his
candour
does
she
love
you
then
that
what
i
ask
her
her
answer
is
that
she
loves
me
only
too
well
she
so
afraid
of
being
a
burden
to
me
that
she
gives
me
my
freedom
till
i
taken
another
year
to
think
i
like
the
way
you
talk
about
other
years
carteret
cried
you
had
better
do
it
while
i
here
to
bless
you
she
thinks
i
proposed
to
her
because
she
got
me
in
for
harsh
said
nick
well
i
sure
it
would
be
a
very
pretty
return
ah
she
does
believe
in
me
the
young
man
repeated
then
i
do
believe
in
do
say
that
do
say
that
she
a
very
rare
creature
but
proud
shy
suspicious
suspicious
of
what
of
everything
she
thinks
i
not
persistent
oh
oh
nick
host
deprecated
such
freedom
she
ca
believe
i
shall
arrive
at
true
eminence
a
good
wife
should
believe
what
her
husband
believes
said
carteret
ah
unfortunately
and
nick
took
the
words
at
a
run
i
do
believe
it
either
carteret
who
might
have
been
watching
an
odd
physical
rush
spoke
with
a
certain
dryness
your
dear
father
did
i
think
of
that
i
think
of
that
nick
replied
certainly
it
will
help
me
if
i
say
we
engaged
he
went
on
because
i
consider
it
so
she
gives
me
my
liberty
but
i
do
take
it
does
she
expect
you
to
take
back
your
word
that
what
i
ask
her
never
will
therefore
we
as
good
as
tied
i
do
like
it
said
carteret
after
a
moment
i
do
like
ambiguous
uncertain
situations
they
please
me
much
better
when
definite
and
clear
the
retreat
of
expression
had
been
sounded
in
his
face
the
aspect
it
wore
when
he
wished
not
to
be
encouraging
but
after
an
instant
he
added
in
a
tone
more
personal
do
disappoint
me
dear
boy
ah
not
willingly
his
visitor
protested
i
told
you
what
i
should
like
to
do
for
you
see
that
the
conditions
come
about
promptly
in
which
i
do
it
are
you
sure
you
do
everything
to
satisfy
mrs
dallow
carteret
continued
i
think
i
very
nice
to
her
nick
declared
but
she
so
ambitious
frankly
speaking
it
a
pity
for
her
that
she
likes
me
she
ca
help
that
the
old
man
charmingly
said
possibly
but
is
it
a
reason
for
taking
me
as
i
am
what
she
wants
to
do
is
to
take
me
as
i
may
be
a
year
hence
i
do
understand
since
you
tell
me
that
even
then
she
wo
take
back
her
word
said
carteret
if
she
does
marry
me
i
think
she
never
marry
again
at
all
what
then
does
she
gain
by
delay
simply
this
as
i
make
it
out
said
nick
that
she
feel
she
has
been
very
magnanimous
she
wo
have
to
reproach
herself
with
not
having
given
me
a
chance
to
change
to
change
what
does
she
think
you
liable
to
do
nick
had
a
pause
i
do
know
he
then
said
not
at
all
candidly
everything
has
altered
young
people
in
my
day
looked
at
these
questions
more
naturally
carteret
observed
a
woman
in
love
has
no
need
to
be
magnanimous
if
she
plays
too
fair
she
is
in
love
he
added
shrewdly
oh
julia
safe
she
safe
nick
smiled
if
it
were
a
question
between
you
and
another
gentleman
one
might
comprehend
but
what
does
it
mean
between
you
and
nothing
i
much
obliged
to
you
sir
nick
returned
the
trouble
is
that
she
does
know
what
she
has
got
hold
of
ah
if
you
ca
make
it
clear
to
her
and
his
friend
showed
the
note
of
impatience
i
such
a
humbug
said
the
young
man
and
while
his
companion
stared
he
continued
i
deceive
people
without
in
the
least
intending
it
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
are
you
deceiving
me
i
do
know
it
depends
on
what
you
think
i
think
you
flighty
said
carteret
with
the
nearest
approach
to
sternness
nick
had
ever
observed
in
him
i
never
thought
so
before
forgive
me
it
all
right
i
not
frivolous
that
i
promise
you
not
you
deceived
me
if
you
are
it
all
right
nick
stammered
with
a
blush
remember
your
name
carry
it
high
i
will
as
high
as
possible
you
no
excuse
do
tell
me
after
your
speeches
at
harsh
nick
was
on
the
point
of
declaring
again
that
he
was
a
humbug
so
vivid
was
his
inner
sense
of
what
he
thought
of
his
factitious
public
utterances
which
had
the
cursed
property
of
creating
dreadful
responsibilities
and
importunate
credulities
for
him
if
was
clever
ah
the
idiotic
clever
what
fools
many
other
people
were
he
repressed
his
impulse
and
carteret
pursued
if
as
you
express
it
dallow
know
what
she
has
got
hold
of
wo
it
clear
the
matter
up
a
little
by
informing
her
that
the
day
before
your
marriage
is
definitely
settled
to
take
place
you
come
into
something
comfortable
a
quick
vision
of
what
carteret
would
be
likely
to
regard
as
something
comfortable
flitted
before
nick
but
it
did
prevent
his
replying
oh
i
afraid
that
wo
do
any
good
it
would
make
her
like
you
better
but
it
would
make
her
like
me
i
afraid
she
wo
care
for
any
benefit
that
comes
to
me
from
another
hand
than
hers
her
affection
a
very
jealous
sentiment
it
a
very
peculiar
one
sighed
carteret
mine
a
jealous
sentiment
too
however
if
she
takes
it
that
way
do
tell
her
i
let
you
know
as
soon
as
she
comes
round
said
nick
and
you
tell
your
mother
carteret
returned
i
shall
like
to
know
it
will
be
delightful
news
to
her
but
she
keen
enough
already
i
know
that
i
may
mention
now
that
she
has
written
to
me
the
old
man
added
so
i
suspected
we
a
corresponded
on
the
subject
carteret
continued
to
confess
my
view
of
the
advantageous
character
of
such
an
alliance
has
entirely
coincided
with
hers
it
was
very
of
you
then
to
leave
me
to
speak
first
said
nick
i
should
have
been
disappointed
if
you
had
i
do
like
all
told
me
but
do
disappoint
me
now
dear
mr
carteret
nick
vaguely
and
richly
sounded
i
wo
disappoint
that
gentleman
went
on
with
a
finer
point
while
he
looked
at
his
big
watch
book
fourth
xviii
at
first
peter
sherringham
thought
of
asking
to
be
transferred
to
another
post
and
went
so
far
in
london
as
to
take
what
he
believed
good
advice
on
the
subject
the
advice
perhaps
struck
him
as
the
better
for
consisting
of
a
strong
recommendation
to
do
nothing
so
foolish
two
or
three
reasons
were
mentioned
to
him
why
such
a
request
would
not
in
the
particular
circumstances
raise
him
in
the
esteem
of
his
superiors
and
he
promptly
recognised
their
force
he
next
became
aware
that
it
might
help
him
not
with
his
superiors
but
with
himself
to
apply
for
an
extension
of
leave
and
then
on
further
reflexion
made
out
that
though
there
are
some
dangers
before
which
it
is
perfectly
consistent
with
honour
to
flee
it
was
better
for
every
one
concerned
that
he
should
fight
this
especial
battle
on
the
spot
during
his
holiday
his
plan
of
campaign
gave
him
plenty
of
occupation
he
refurbished
his
arms
rubbed
up
his
strategy
laid
down
his
lines
of
defence
there
was
only
one
thing
in
life
his
mind
had
been
much
made
up
to
but
on
this
question
he
had
never
wavered
he
would
get
on
to
the
utmost
in
his
profession
that
was
a
point
on
which
it
was
perfectly
lawful
to
be
unamiable
to
others
to
be
vigilant
eager
suspicious
selfish
he
had
not
in
fact
been
unamiable
to
others
for
his
affairs
had
not
required
it
he
had
got
on
well
enough
without
hardening
his
heart
fortune
had
been
kind
to
him
and
he
had
passed
so
many
competitors
on
the
way
that
he
could
forswear
jealousy
and
be
generous
but
he
had
always
flattered
himself
his
hand
would
falter
on
the
day
he
should
find
it
necessary
to
drop
bitterness
into
his
cup
this
day
would
be
sure
to
dawn
since
no
career
could
be
all
clear
water
to
the
end
and
then
the
sacrifice
would
find
him
ready
his
mind
was
familiar
with
the
thought
of
a
sacrifice
it
is
true
that
no
great
plainness
invested
beforehand
the
occasion
the
object
or
the
victim
all
that
particularly
stood
out
was
that
the
propitiatory
offering
would
have
to
be
some
cherished
enjoyment
very
likely
indeed
this
enjoyment
would
be
associated
with
the
charms
of
another
person
a
probability
pregnant
with
the
idea
that
such
charms
would
have
to
be
dashed
out
of
sight
at
any
rate
it
never
had
occurred
to
sherringham
that
he
himself
might
be
the
sacrifice
you
had
to
pay
to
get
on
but
at
least
you
borrowed
from
others
to
do
it
when
you
could
borrow
you
did
get
on
for
what
was
the
situation
in
life
in
which
you
met
the
whole
requisition
yourself
least
of
all
had
it
occurred
to
our
friend
that
the
wrench
might
come
through
his
interest
in
that
branch
of
art
on
which
nick
dormer
had
rallied
him
the
beauty
of
a
love
of
the
theatre
was
precisely
in
its
being
a
passion
exercised
on
the
easiest
terms
this
was
not
the
region
of
responsibility
it
was
sniffed
at
to
its
discredit
by
the
austere
but
if
it
was
not
as
such
people
said
a
serious
field
was
not
the
compensation
just
that
you
could
be
seriously
entangled
in
it
sherringham
great
advantage
as
he
regarded
the
matter
was
that
he
had
always
kept
his
taste
for
the
drama
quite
in
its
place
his
facetious
cousin
was
free
to
pretend
that
it
sprawled
through
his
life
but
this
was
nonsense
as
any
unprejudiced
observer
of
that
life
would
unhesitatingly
attest
there
had
not
been
the
least
sprawling
and
his
interest
in
the
art
of
garrick
had
never
he
was
sure
made
him
in
any
degree
ridiculous
it
had
never
drawn
down
from
above
anything
approaching
a
reprimand
a
remonstrance
a
remark
sherringham
was
positively
proud
of
his
discretion
for
he
was
not
a
little
proud
of
what
he
did
know
about
the
stage
trifling
for
trifling
there
were
plenty
of
his
fellows
who
had
in
their
lives
infatuations
less
edifying
and
less
confessable
had
he
known
men
who
collected
old
and
were
ready
to
commit
for
those
of
the
eighteenth
century
had
he
known
others
who
had
a
secret
passion
for
shuffleboard
his
little
weaknesses
were
intellectual
they
were
a
part
of
the
life
of
the
mind
all
the
same
on
the
day
they
showed
a
symptom
of
interfering
they
should
be
plucked
off
with
a
turn
of
the
wrist
sherringham
scented
interference
now
and
interference
in
rather
an
invidious
form
it
might
be
a
bore
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
profession
to
find
one
self
as
a
critic
of
the
stage
in
love
with
a
but
it
was
a
much
greater
bore
to
find
one
self
in
love
with
a
young
woman
whose
character
remained
to
be
estimated
miriam
rooth
was
neither
fish
nor
flesh
one
had
with
her
neither
the
guarantees
of
one
own
class
nor
the
immunities
of
hers
what
hers
if
one
came
to
that
a
rare
ambiguity
on
this
point
was
part
of
the
fascination
she
had
ended
by
throwing
over
him
poor
peter
scheme
for
getting
on
had
contained
no
proviso
against
his
falling
in
love
but
it
had
embodied
an
important
clause
on
the
subject
of
surprises
it
was
always
a
surprise
to
fall
in
love
especially
if
one
was
looking
out
for
it
so
this
contingency
had
not
been
worth
official
paper
but
it
became
a
man
who
respected
the
service
he
had
undertaken
for
the
state
to
be
on
his
guard
against
predicaments
from
which
the
only
issue
was
the
rigour
of
matrimony
ambition
in
the
career
was
probably
consistent
with
marrying
but
only
with
opening
one
eyes
very
wide
to
do
it
that
was
the
fatal
surprise
to
be
led
to
the
altar
in
a
dream
sherringham
view
of
the
proprieties
attached
to
such
a
step
was
high
and
strict
and
if
he
held
that
a
man
in
his
position
was
above
all
as
the
position
improved
essentially
a
representative
of
the
greatness
of
his
country
he
considered
that
the
wife
of
such
a
personage
would
exercise
in
her
degree
for
instance
at
a
foreign
court
a
function
no
less
symbolic
she
would
in
short
always
be
a
very
important
quantity
and
the
scene
was
strewn
with
illustrations
of
this
general
truth
she
might
be
such
a
help
and
might
be
such
a
blight
that
common
prudence
required
some
test
of
her
in
advance
sherringham
had
seen
women
in
the
career
who
were
stupid
or
vulgar
make
such
a
mess
of
things
as
would
wring
your
heart
then
he
had
his
positive
idea
of
the
perfect
ambassadress
the
lily
of
the
future
and
with
this
idea
miriam
rooth
presented
no
analogy
whatever
the
girl
had
described
herself
with
characteristic
directness
as
all
right
and
so
she
might
be
so
she
assuredly
was
only
all
right
for
what
he
had
made
out
she
was
not
sentimental
that
whatever
capacity
she
might
have
for
responding
to
a
devotion
or
for
desiring
it
was
at
any
rate
not
in
the
direction
of
vague
philandering
with
him
certainly
she
had
no
disposition
to
philander
sherringham
almost
feared
to
dwell
on
this
lest
it
should
beget
in
him
a
rage
convertible
mainly
into
caring
for
her
more
rage
or
no
rage
it
would
be
charming
to
be
in
love
with
her
if
there
were
no
complications
but
the
complications
were
just
what
was
clearest
in
the
prospect
he
was
perhaps
to
think
of
them
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
they
were
the
particular
thing
his
training
had
equipped
him
for
dealing
with
he
was
at
all
events
not
too
to
have
for
the
two
months
of
his
holiday
very
little
inner
vision
of
anything
more
abstract
than
miriam
face
the
desire
to
see
it
again
was
as
pressing
as
thirst
but
he
tried
to
practise
the
endurance
of
the
traveller
in
the
desert
he
kept
the
channel
between
them
but
his
spirit
consumed
every
day
an
inch
of
the
interval
until
and
it
was
not
long
there
were
no
more
inches
left
the
last
thing
he
expected
the
future
ambassadress
to
have
been
was
de
the
answer
to
this
objection
was
of
course
that
miriam
was
not
yet
so
much
of
one
but
that
he
could
easily
by
a
handsome
worldly
offer
arrest
her
development
then
came
worrying
retorts
to
that
chief
among
which
was
the
sense
that
to
his
artistic
conscience
arresting
her
development
would
be
a
plan
combining
on
his
part
fatuity
not
to
say
imbecility
with
baseness
it
was
exactly
to
her
development
the
poor
girl
had
the
greatest
right
and
he
really
alter
anything
by
depriving
her
of
it
was
she
the
artist
to
the
tips
of
her
tresses
the
ambassadress
never
in
the
world
and
would
she
take
it
out
in
something
else
if
one
were
to
make
her
deviate
so
certain
was
that
demonic
gift
to
insist
ever
on
its
own
besides
one
make
her
deviate
if
she
had
no
disposition
to
philander
what
was
his
warrant
for
supposing
she
could
be
corrupted
into
respectability
how
could
the
career
his
career
speak
to
a
nature
that
had
glimpses
as
vivid
as
they
were
crude
of
such
a
different
range
and
for
which
success
meant
quite
another
sauce
to
the
dish
would
the
brilliancy
of
marrying
peter
sherringham
be
such
a
bribe
to
relinquishment
how
could
he
think
so
without
pretensions
of
the
sort
he
pretended
exactly
not
to
flaunt
how
could
he
put
himself
forward
as
so
high
a
prize
relinquishment
of
the
opportunity
to
exercise
a
rare
talent
was
not
in
the
nature
of
things
an
easy
effort
to
a
young
lady
who
was
herself
presumptuous
as
well
as
ambitious
besides
she
might
eat
her
cake
and
have
it
might
make
her
fortune
both
on
the
stage
and
in
the
world
successful
actresses
had
ended
by
marrying
dukes
and
was
not
that
better
than
remaining
obscure
and
marrying
a
commoner
there
were
moments
when
he
tried
to
pronounce
the
girl
gift
not
a
force
to
reckon
with
there
was
so
little
to
show
for
it
as
yet
that
the
caprice
of
believing
in
it
would
perhaps
suddenly
leave
him
but
his
conviction
that
it
was
real
was
too
uneasy
to
make
such
an
experiment
peaceful
and
he
came
back
moreover
to
his
deepest
impression
that
of
her
being
of
the
inward
mould
for
which
the
only
consistency
is
the
play
of
genius
had
madame
carré
declared
at
the
last
that
she
could
do
anything
it
was
true
that
if
madame
carré
had
been
mistaken
in
the
first
place
she
might
also
be
mistaken
in
the
second
but
in
this
latter
case
she
would
be
mistaken
with
him
and
such
an
error
would
be
too
like
a
truth
how
further
shall
we
exactly
measure
for
him
sherringham
felt
the
discomfort
of
the
advantage
miriam
had
of
him
the
advantage
of
her
presenting
herself
in
a
light
that
rendered
any
passion
he
might
entertain
an
implication
of
duty
as
well
as
of
pleasure
why
there
should
have
been
this
implication
was
more
than
he
could
say
sometimes
he
held
himself
rather
abject
or
at
least
absurdly
superstitious
for
seeing
it
he
did
know
he
could
scarcely
conceive
of
another
case
of
the
same
general
type
in
which
he
would
have
recognised
it
in
foreign
countries
there
were
very
few
ladies
of
miss
rooth
intended
profession
who
would
not
have
regarded
it
as
too
strong
an
order
that
to
console
them
for
not
being
admitted
into
they
should
have
no
offset
but
the
exercise
of
a
virtue
in
which
no
one
would
believe
this
was
because
in
foreign
countries
actresses
were
not
admitted
into
that
was
a
pure
english
drollery
ministering
equally
little
to
real
histrionics
and
to
the
higher
tone
of
these
resorts
did
the
oppressive
sanctity
which
made
it
a
burden
to
have
to
reckon
with
his
young
friend
come
then
from
her
being
english
peter
could
recall
cases
in
which
that
privilege
operated
as
little
as
possible
as
a
restriction
it
came
a
great
deal
from
rooth
in
whom
he
apprehended
depths
of
calculation
as
to
what
she
might
achieve
for
her
daughter
by
working
the
idea
of
a
life
blameless
amid
dire
obsessions
her
romantic
turn
of
mind
would
in
the
least
prevent
her
regarding
that
idea
as
a
substantial
capital
to
be
laid
out
to
the
best
worldly
advantage
miriam
essential
irreverence
was
capable
on
a
pretext
of
making
of
it
that
he
was
sure
of
for
the
only
capital
she
recognised
was
the
talent
which
some
day
managers
and
agents
would
outbid
each
other
in
paying
for
yet
as
a
creature
easy
at
so
many
points
she
was
fond
of
her
mother
would
do
anything
to
oblige
that
might
work
in
all
sorts
of
ways
and
would
probably
like
the
loose
slippers
of
blamelessness
quite
as
well
as
having
to
meet
some
of
the
queer
high
standards
of
the
opposite
camp
sherringham
i
may
add
had
no
desire
that
she
should
indulge
a
different
preference
it
was
distasteful
to
him
to
compute
the
probabilities
of
a
young
lady
misbehaving
for
his
advantage
that
seemed
to
him
definitely
base
and
he
would
have
thought
himself
a
blackguard
if
even
when
a
prey
to
his
desire
he
had
not
wished
the
thing
that
was
best
for
the
object
of
it
the
thing
best
for
miriam
might
be
to
become
the
wife
of
the
man
to
whose
suit
she
should
incline
her
ear
that
this
would
be
the
best
thing
for
the
gentleman
in
question
by
no
means
however
equally
followed
and
sherringham
final
conviction
was
that
it
would
never
do
for
him
to
act
the
part
of
that
hypothetic
personage
he
asked
for
no
removal
and
no
extension
of
leave
and
he
proved
to
himself
how
well
he
knew
what
he
was
about
by
never
addressing
a
line
during
his
absence
to
the
hôtel
de
la
garonne
he
would
simply
go
straight
inflicting
as
little
injury
on
peter
sherringham
as
on
any
one
else
he
remained
away
to
the
last
hour
of
his
privilege
and
continued
to
act
lucidly
in
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
mother
and
daughter
for
several
days
after
his
return
to
paris
it
was
when
this
discipline
came
to
an
end
one
afternoon
after
a
week
had
passed
that
he
felt
most
the
force
of
the
reference
we
have
just
made
to
rooth
private
calculations
he
found
her
at
home
alone
writing
a
letter
under
the
lamp
and
as
soon
as
he
came
in
she
cried
out
that
he
was
the
very
person
to
whom
the
letter
was
addressed
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
she
had
permitted
herself
to
reproach
him
with
his
terrible
silence
to
ask
why
he
had
quite
forsaken
them
it
was
an
illustration
of
the
way
in
which
her
visitor
had
come
to
regard
her
that
he
put
rather
less
than
more
faith
into
this
description
of
the
crumpled
papers
lying
on
the
table
he
was
not
even
sure
he
quite
believed
miriam
to
have
just
gone
out
he
told
her
mother
how
busy
he
had
been
all
the
while
he
was
away
and
how
much
time
above
all
he
had
had
to
give
in
london
to
seeing
on
her
daughter
behalf
the
people
connected
with
the
theatres
ah
if
you
pity
me
tell
me
you
got
her
an
engagement
rooth
cried
while
she
clasped
her
hands
i
took
a
great
deal
of
trouble
i
wrote
ever
so
many
notes
sought
introductions
talked
with
people
such
impossible
people
some
of
them
in
short
i
knocked
at
every
door
i
went
into
the
question
exhaustively
and
he
enumerated
the
things
he
had
done
reported
on
some
of
the
knowledge
he
had
gathered
the
difficulties
were
immense
and
even
with
the
influence
he
could
command
such
as
it
was
there
was
very
little
to
be
achieved
in
face
of
them
still
he
had
gained
ground
two
or
three
approachable
fellows
men
with
inferior
theatres
had
listened
to
him
better
than
the
others
and
there
was
one
in
particular
whom
he
had
a
hope
he
really
might
have
interested
from
him
he
had
extracted
benevolent
assurances
this
person
would
see
miriam
would
listen
to
her
would
do
for
her
what
he
could
the
trouble
was
that
no
one
would
lift
a
finger
for
a
girl
unless
she
were
known
and
yet
that
she
never
could
become
known
till
innumerable
fingers
had
been
lifted
you
could
go
into
the
water
unless
you
could
swim
and
you
swim
until
you
had
been
in
the
water
but
new
performers
appear
they
get
theatres
they
get
audiences
they
get
notices
in
the
newspapers
rooth
objected
i
know
of
these
things
only
what
miriam
tells
me
it
no
knowledge
that
i
was
born
to
it
perfectly
true
it
all
done
with
money
and
how
do
they
come
by
money
rooth
candidly
asked
when
they
women
people
give
it
to
them
well
what
people
now
people
who
believe
in
them
as
you
believe
in
miriam
peter
had
a
pause
no
rather
differently
a
poor
man
does
believe
in
anything
the
same
way
that
a
rich
man
does
ah
do
call
yourself
poor
groaned
rooth
what
good
would
it
do
me
to
be
rich
why
you
could
take
a
theatre
you
could
do
it
all
yourself
and
what
good
would
that
do
me
ah
do
you
delight
in
her
genius
demanded
rooth
i
delight
in
her
mother
you
think
me
more
disinterested
than
i
am
sherringham
added
with
a
certain
soreness
of
irritation
i
know
why
you
did
write
rooth
declared
archly
you
must
go
to
london
peter
said
without
heeding
this
remark
ah
if
we
could
only
get
there
it
would
be
a
relief
i
should
draw
a
long
breath
there
at
least
i
know
where
i
am
and
what
people
are
but
here
one
lives
on
hollow
ground
the
sooner
you
get
away
the
better
our
young
man
went
on
i
know
why
you
say
that
it
just
what
i
explaining
i
could
have
held
out
if
i
had
been
so
sure
of
miriam
said
rooth
well
you
need
hold
out
any
longer
do
trust
her
asked
sherringham
hostess
trust
her
you
do
trust
yourself
that
why
you
were
silent
why
we
might
have
thought
you
were
dead
why
we
might
have
perished
ourselves
i
do
think
i
understand
you
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
peter
returned
but
it
does
matter
does
it
let
yourself
go
why
should
you
struggle
the
old
woman
agreeably
inquired
her
unexpected
insistence
annoyed
her
visitor
and
he
was
silent
again
meeting
her
eyes
with
reserve
and
on
the
point
of
telling
her
that
he
did
like
her
tone
but
he
had
his
tongue
under
such
control
that
he
was
able
presently
to
say
instead
of
this
and
it
was
a
relief
to
him
to
give
audible
voice
to
the
reflexion
it
a
great
mistake
either
way
for
a
man
to
be
in
love
with
an
actress
either
it
means
nothing
serious
and
what
the
use
of
that
or
it
means
everything
and
still
more
delusive
delusive
idle
unprofitable
surely
a
pure
affection
is
its
own
beautiful
reward
rooth
pleaded
with
soft
reasonableness
in
such
a
case
how
can
it
be
pure
i
thought
you
were
talking
of
an
english
gentleman
she
replied
call
the
poor
fellow
whatever
you
like
a
man
with
his
life
to
lead
his
way
to
make
his
work
his
duties
his
career
to
attend
to
if
it
means
nothing
as
i
say
the
thing
it
means
least
of
all
is
marriage
oh
my
own
miriam
rooth
wailed
fancy
on
the
other
hand
the
complication
when
such
a
man
marries
a
woman
who
on
the
stage
rooth
looked
as
if
she
were
trying
to
follow
miriam
is
on
the
stage
yet
go
to
london
and
she
soon
will
be
yes
and
then
you
have
your
excuse
my
excuse
for
deserting
us
altogether
he
broke
into
laughter
at
this
the
logic
was
so
droll
then
he
went
on
show
me
some
good
acting
and
i
wo
desert
you
good
acting
ah
what
the
best
acting
compared
with
the
position
of
a
true
english
lady
if
you
take
her
as
she
is
you
may
have
her
rooth
suddenly
added
as
she
is
with
all
her
ambitions
unassuaged
to
marry
might
not
that
be
an
ambition
a
very
paltry
one
do
answer
for
her
do
attempt
that
said
peter
you
can
do
much
better
do
you
think
can
smiled
rooth
i
do
want
to
i
only
want
to
let
it
alone
she
an
artist
you
must
give
her
her
head
the
young
man
pursued
you
must
always
give
an
artist
his
head
but
i
known
great
ladies
who
were
artists
in
english
society
there
always
a
field
do
talk
to
me
of
english
society
thank
goodness
in
the
first
place
i
do
live
in
it
do
you
want
her
to
give
up
her
genius
he
demanded
i
thought
you
did
care
for
it
she
say
i
thank
you
dear
mamma
my
wonderful
child
rooth
almost
comprehendingly
murmured
have
you
ever
proposed
it
to
her
proposed
it
that
she
should
give
up
trying
rooth
hesitated
looking
down
not
for
the
reason
you
mean
we
do
talk
about
love
she
simpered
then
it
so
much
less
time
wasted
do
stretch
out
your
hand
to
the
worse
when
it
may
some
day
grasp
the
better
peter
continued
rooth
raised
her
eyes
at
him
as
if
recognising
the
force
there
might
be
in
that
and
he
added
let
her
blaze
out
let
her
look
about
her
then
you
may
talk
to
me
if
you
like
it
very
puzzling
the
old
woman
artlessly
sighed
he
laughed
again
and
then
said
now
do
tell
me
i
not
a
good
friend
you
are
indeed
you
a
very
noble
gentleman
that
just
why
a
quiet
life
with
you
it
would
be
quiet
for
he
broke
in
and
that
not
what
miriam
was
made
for
say
for
my
precious
one
rooth
quavered
go
to
london
go
to
london
her
visitor
repeated
thoughtfully
after
an
instant
she
extended
her
hand
and
took
from
the
table
the
letter
on
the
composition
of
which
he
had
found
her
engaged
then
with
a
quick
movement
she
tore
it
up
that
what
dashwood
says
mr
dashwood
i
forgot
you
do
know
him
he
the
brother
of
that
lady
we
met
the
day
you
were
so
good
as
to
receive
us
the
one
who
was
so
kind
to
us
mrs
lovick
i
never
heard
of
him
do
you
remember
how
she
spoke
of
him
and
that
lovick
did
seem
very
nice
about
him
she
told
us
that
if
he
were
to
meet
us
and
she
was
so
good
as
to
intimate
that
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
him
to
do
so
he
might
give
us
as
she
said
a
tip
peter
achieved
the
effort
to
recollect
yes
he
comes
back
to
me
an
actor
he
a
gentleman
too
said
rooth
and
you
met
him
and
he
given
you
a
tip
as
i
say
he
wants
us
to
go
to
london
i
see
but
even
i
can
tell
you
that
oh
yes
said
rooth
but
says
he
can
help
us
keep
hold
of
him
then
if
he
in
the
business
peter
was
all
for
that
he
a
perfect
gentleman
said
rooth
he
immensely
struck
with
miriam
better
and
better
keep
hold
of
him
well
i
glad
you
do
object
she
grimaced
why
should
i
object
you
do
regard
us
as
your
own
my
own
why
i
regard
you
as
the
public
the
world
she
gave
a
little
shudder
there
a
sort
of
chill
in
that
it
grand
but
it
cold
however
i
need
hesitate
then
to
tell
you
that
with
dashwood
miriam
has
gone
out
why
hesitate
gracious
heaven
but
in
the
next
breath
sherringham
asked
where
have
they
gone
you
do
like
it
his
hostess
laughed
why
should
it
be
a
thing
to
be
enthusiastic
about
well
he
charming
and
trust
him
so
do
i
said
sherringham
they
gone
to
see
madame
carré
she
has
come
back
then
she
was
expected
back
last
week
miriam
wants
to
show
her
how
she
has
improved
and
she
improved
how
can
i
tell
with
my
mother
heart
asked
rooth
i
judge
i
only
wait
and
pray
but
dashwood
thinks
she
wonderful
that
a
blessing
and
when
did
he
turn
up
about
a
fortnight
ago
we
met
lovick
at
the
english
church
and
she
was
so
good
as
to
recognise
us
and
speak
to
us
she
said
she
had
been
away
with
her
children
otherwise
she
have
come
to
see
us
she
had
just
returned
to
paris
yes
i
not
yet
seen
her
i
see
lovick
peter
added
but
he
talk
of
his
i
did
that
day
like
his
tone
about
him
rooth
observed
we
walked
a
little
way
with
lovick
after
church
and
she
asked
miriam
about
her
prospects
and
if
she
were
working
miriam
said
she
had
no
prospects
that
was
very
nice
to
me
sherringham
commented
but
when
you
had
left
us
in
black
darkness
what
our
prospects
i
see
it
all
right
go
on
then
lovick
said
her
brother
was
to
be
in
paris
a
few
days
and
she
would
tell
him
to
come
and
see
us
he
arrived
she
told
him
and
he
came
said
rooth
so
that
now
so
far
as
is
concerned
miss
rooth
has
prospects
he
is
a
manager
unfortunately
she
qualified
where
does
he
act
he
is
acting
just
now

has
been
abroad
he
has
been
to
italy
i
believe
and
is
just
stopping
here
on
his
way
to
london
i
see
he
a
perfect
gentleman
said
sherringham
ah
you
jealous
of
him
no
but
you
trying
to
make
me
so
the
more
competitors
there
are
for
the
glory
of
bringing
her
out
the
better
for
her
dashwood
wants
to
take
a
theatre
said
rooth
then
perhaps
he
our
man
oh
if
you
help
him
she
richly
cried
help
him
help
him
to
help
us
we
all
work
together
it
will
be
very
jolly
said
sherringham
gaily
it
a
sacred
cause
the
love
of
art
and
we
shall
be
a
happy
band
dashwood
his
name
he
added
in
a
moment
lovick
was
a
dashwood
it
his
de
basil
dashwood
do
you
like
it
rooth
wonderfully
inquired
you
say
that
as
miriam
might
her
talent
catching
she
always
practising
always
saying
things
over
and
over
to
seize
the
tone
i
her
voice
in
my
ears
he
wants
not
to
have
any
not
to
have
any
what
any
de
he
wants
her
to
use
her
own
he
likes
it
so
much
he
says
it
will
do
so
well
you
ca
better
it
he
a
capital
adviser
said
sherringham
getting
up
i
come
back
i
wo
ask
you
to
wait
for
them
they
may
be
so
long
his
hostess
returned
will
he
come
back
with
her
peter
asked
while
he
smoothed
his
hat
i
hope
so
at
this
hour
with
my
child
in
the
streets
i
tremble
we
do
live
in
cabs
as
you
may
easily
suppose
did
they
go
on
foot
sherringham
continued
oh
yes
they
started
in
high
spirits
and
is
mr
basil
dashwood
acquainted
with
madame
carré
ah
no
but
he
longed
to
be
introduced
to
her
he
persuaded
miriam
to
take
him
naturally
she
wishes
to
oblige
him
she
very
nice
to
him
if
he
can
do
anything
quite
right
that
the
way
peter
cheerfully
rang
out
and
she
also
wanted
him
to
see
what
she
can
do
for
the
great
critic
rooth
added
that
terrible
old
woman
in
the
red
wig
that
what
i
should
like
to
see
too
peter
permitted
himself
to
acknowledge
oh
she
has
gone
ahead
she
pleased
with
herself
work
work
said
madame
carré
well
she
has
worked
worked
worked
that
what
dashwood
is
pleased
with
even
more
than
with
other
things
what
do
you
mean
by
other
things
oh
her
genius
and
her
fine
appearance
he
approves
of
her
fine
appearance
i
ask
because
you
think
he
knows
what
will
take
i
know
why
you
ask
rooth
bravely
mocked
he
says
it
will
be
worth
hundreds
of
thousands
to
her
that
the
sort
of
thing
i
like
to
hear
peter
returned
i
come
in
he
repeated
and
shall
you
mind
if
mr
dash
wood
here
does
he
come
every
day
oh
they
always
at
it
at
it
he
was
vague
why
she
acts
to
him
every
sort
of
thing
and
he
says
if
it
will
do
how
many
days
has
he
been
here
then
rooth
reflected
oh
i
do
know
since
he
turned
up
passed
so
quickly
so
far
from
it
i
eager
to
see
him
sherringham
declared
and
i
can
imagine
nothing
better
than
what
you
describe
if
he
is
an
awful
ass
dear
me
if
he
is
clever
you
must
tell
us
we
ca
afford
to
be
deceived
rooth
innocently
wailed
what
do
we
know
how
can
we
judge
she
appealed
he
had
a
pause
his
hand
on
the
latch
oh
i
tell
you
frankly
what
i
think
of
him
xix
when
he
got
into
the
street
he
looked
about
him
for
a
cab
but
was
obliged
to
walk
some
distance
before
encountering
one
in
this
little
interval
he
saw
no
reason
to
modify
the
determination
he
had
formed
in
descending
the
steep
staircase
of
the
hôtel
de
la
garonne
indeed
the
desire
prompting
it
only
quickened
his
pace
he
had
an
hour
to
spare
and
would
also
go
to
see
madame
carré
if
miriam
and
her
companion
had
proceeded
to
the
rue
de
constantinople
on
foot
he
would
probably
reach
the
house
as
soon
as
they
it
was
all
quite
logical
he
was
eager
to
see
miriam
that
was
natural
enough
and
he
had
admitted
to
rooth
that
he
was
keen
on
the
subject
of
lovick
theatrical
brother
in
whom
such
effective
aid
might
perhaps
reside
to
catch
miriam
really
revealing
herself
to
the
old
actress
after
the
jump
she
believed
herself
to
have
taken
since
that
was
her
errand
would
be
a
very
happy
stroke
the
thought
of
which
made
her
benefactor
impatient
he
presently
found
his
cab
and
as
he
bounded
in
bade
the
coachman
drive
fast
he
learned
from
madame
carré
portress
that
her
illustrious
was
at
home
and
that
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
had
gone
up
some
time
before
in
the
little
antechamber
after
his
admission
he
heard
a
high
voice
come
from
the
salon
and
stopping
a
moment
to
listen
noted
that
miriam
was
already
launched
in
a
recitation
he
was
able
to
make
out
the
words
all
the
more
that
before
he
could
prevent
the
movement
the
who
had
led
him
in
had
already
opened
the
door
of
the
room
one
of
the
leaves
of
it
there
being
as
in
most
french
doors
two
of
these
before
which
within
a
heavy
curtain
was
suspended
miriam
was
in
the
act
of
rolling
out
some
speech
from
the
english
poetic
drama
for
i
am
sick
and
capable
of
fears
oppressed
with
wrongs
and
therefore
full
of
fears
he
recognised
one
of
the
great
tirades
of
shakespeare
constance
and
saw
she
had
just
begun
the
magnificent
scene
at
the
beginning
of
the
third
act
of
in
which
the
passionate
injured
mother
and
widow
sweeps
in
wild
the
entire
scale
of
her
irony
and
wrath
the
curtain
concealed
him
and
he
lurked
three
minutes
after
he
had
motioned
to
the
de
to
retire
on
tiptoe
the
trio
in
the
salon
absorbed
in
the
performance
had
apparently
not
heard
his
entrance
or
the
opening
of
the
door
which
was
covered
by
the
splendid
declamation
peter
listened
intently
arrested
by
the
spirit
with
which
she
attacked
her
formidable
verses
he
had
needed
to
hear
her
set
afloat
but
a
dozen
of
them
to
measure
the
long
stride
she
had
taken
in
his
absence
they
assured
him
she
had
leaped
into
possession
of
her
means
he
remained
where
he
was
till
she
arrived
at
then
speak
again
not
all
thy
former
tale
but
this
one
word
whether
thy
tale
be
true
this
apostrophe
briefly
responded
to
in
another
voice
gave
him
time
quickly
to
raise
the
curtain
and
show
himself
passing
into
the
room
with
a
go
on
go
on
and
a
gesture
earnestly
deprecating
a
stop
miriam
in
the
full
swing
of
her
part
paused
but
for
an
instant
and
let
herself
ring
out
again
while
peter
sank
into
the
nearest
chair
and
she
fixed
him
with
her
illumined
eyes
that
is
with
those
of
the
raving
constance
madame
carré
buried
in
a
chair
kissed
her
hand
to
him
and
a
young
man
who
near
the
girl
stood
giving
the
cue
stared
at
him
over
the
top
of
a
little
book
admirable
magnificent
go
on
sherringham
repeated
go
on
to
the
end
of
the
scene
do
it
all
miriam
colour
rose
yet
he
as
quickly
felt
that
she
had
no
personal
emotion
in
seeing
him
again
the
cold
passion
of
art
had
perched
on
her
banner
and
she
listened
to
herself
with
an
ear
as
vigilant
as
if
she
had
been
a
paganini
drawing
a
this
effect
deepened
as
she
went
on
rising
and
rising
to
the
great
occasion
moving
with
extraordinary
ease
and
in
the
largest
clearest
style
at
the
dizzy
height
of
her
idea
that
she
had
an
idea
was
visible
enough
and
that
the
whole
thing
was
very
different
from
all
sherringham
had
hitherto
heard
her
attempt
it
belonged
quite
to
another
class
of
effort
she
was
now
the
finished
statue
lifted
from
the
ground
to
its
pedestal
it
was
as
if
the
sun
of
her
talent
had
risen
above
the
hills
and
she
knew
she
was
moving
and
would
always
move
in
its
guiding
light
this
conviction
was
the
one
artless
thing
that
glimmered
like
a
young
joy
through
the
tragic
mask
of
constance
and
sherringham
heart
beat
faster
as
he
caught
it
in
her
face
it
only
showed
her
as
more
intelligent
and
yet
there
had
been
a
time
when
he
thought
her
stupid
masterful
the
whole
spirit
in
which
she
carried
the
scene
making
him
cry
to
himself
from
point
to
point
how
she
feels
it
sees
it
and
really
it
he
looked
now
and
again
at
madame
carré
and
saw
she
had
in
her
lap
an
open
book
apparently
a
french
prose
version
brought
by
her
visitors
of
the
play
but
she
never
either
glanced
at
him
or
at
the
volume
she
only
sat
screwing
into
the
girl
her
hard
bright
eyes
polished
by
experience
like
fine
old
brasses
the
young
man
uttering
the
lines
of
the
other
speakers
was
attentive
in
another
degree
he
followed
miriam
in
his
own
copy
to
keep
sure
of
the
cue
but
he
was
elated
and
expressive
was
evidently
even
surprised
he
coloured
and
smiled
and
when
he
extended
his
hand
to
assist
constance
to
rise
after
the
performer
acting
out
her
text
had
seated
herself
grandly
on
the
huge
firm
earth
he
bowed
over
her
as
obsequiously
as
if
she
had
been
his
veritable
sovereign
he
was
a
young
man
tall
and
fair
of
whom
manifestly
the
first
thing
to
be
said
on
any
occasion
was
that
he
had
remarkably
the
stamp
of
a
gentleman
he
earned
this
appearance
which
proved
inveterate
and
importunate
to
a
point
that
was
almost
a
denial
of
its
spirit
so
prompt
the
question
of
whether
it
could
be
in
good
taste
to
wear
any
character
even
that
particular
one
so
much
on
one
sleeve
it
was
literally
on
his
sleeve
that
this
young
man
partly
wore
his
own
for
it
resided
considerably
in
his
garments
and
in
especial
in
a
certain
dark
blue
a
miracle
of
a
fit
which
moulded
his
juvenility
just
enough
and
not
too
much
and
constituted
as
sherringham
was
destined
to
perceive
later
his
perpetual
uniform
or
badge
it
was
not
till
afterwards
that
peter
began
to
feel
exasperated
by
basil
dashwood
type
the
young
stranger
was
of
course
basil
dashwood
and
even
by
his
blue
the
recurrent
unvarying
imperturbable
good
form
of
his
aspect
this
unprofessional
air
ended
by
striking
the
observer
as
the
very
profession
he
had
adopted
and
was
indeed
so
far
as
had
as
yet
been
indicated
his
mimetic
capital
his
main
qualification
for
the
stage
the
ample
and
powerful
manner
in
which
miriam
handled
her
scene
produced
its
full
impression
the
art
with
which
she
surmounted
its
difficulties
the
liberality
with
which
she
met
its
great
demand
upon
the
voice
and
the
variety
of
expression
that
she
threw
into
a
torrent
of
objurgation
it
was
a
real
composition
studded
with
passages
that
called
a
suppressed
tribute
to
the
lips
and
seeming
to
show
that
a
talent
capable
of
such
an
exhibition
was
capable
of
anything
but
thou
art
fair
and
at
thy
birth
dear
boy
nature
and
fortune
join
to
make
thee
great
of
nature
gifts
thou
mayst
with
lilies
boast
and
with
the
rose
as
the
girl
turned
to
her
imagined
child
with
this
exquisite
apostrophe
she
addressed
dashwood
as
if
he
were
playing
arthur
and
he
lowered
his
book
dropped
his
head
and
his
eyes
and
looked
handsome
and
ingenuous
she
opened
at
a
stroke
to
sherringham
vision
a
prospect
that
they
would
yet
see
her
express
tenderness
better
even
than
anything
else
her
voice
was
enchanting
in
these
lines
and
the
beauty
of
her
performance
was
that
though
she
uttered
the
full
fury
of
the
part
she
missed
none
of
its
poetry
where
did
she
get
hold
of
that
where
did
she
get
hold
of
that
peter
wondered
while
his
whole
sense
vibrated
she
had
got
hold
of
it
when
i
went
away
and
the
assurance
flowed
over
him
again
that
she
had
found
the
key
to
her
box
of
treasures
in
the
summer
during
their
weeks
of
frequent
meeting
she
had
only
fumbled
with
the
lock
one
october
day
while
he
was
away
the
key
had
slipped
in
had
fitted
or
her
finger
at
last
had
touched
the
right
spring
and
the
capricious
casket
had
flown
open
it
was
during
the
present
solemnity
that
excited
by
the
way
she
came
out
and
with
a
hundred
stirred
ideas
about
her
wheeling
through
his
mind
he
was
for
the
first
time
and
most
vividly
visited
by
a
perception
that
ended
by
becoming
frequent
with
him
that
of
the
perfect
presence
of
mind
unconfused
unhurried
by
emotion
that
any
artistic
performance
requires
and
that
all
whatever
the
instrument
require
in
exactly
the
same
degree
the
application
in
other
words
clear
and
calculated
as
it
were
of
the
idea
conceived
in
the
glow
of
experience
of
suffering
of
joy
he
was
afterwards
often
to
talk
of
this
with
miriam
who
however
was
never
to
be
able
to
present
him
with
a
neat
theory
of
the
subject
she
had
no
knowledge
that
it
was
publicly
discussed
she
only
ranged
herself
in
practice
on
the
side
of
those
who
hold
that
at
the
moment
of
production
the
artist
ca
too
much
have
his
wits
about
him
when
peter
named
to
her
the
opinion
of
those
maintaining
that
at
such
a
crisis
the
office
of
attention
ceases
to
be
filled
she
stared
with
surprise
and
then
broke
out
ah
the
poor
idiots
she
eventually
became
in
her
judgements
in
impatience
and
the
expression
of
contempt
very
free
and
absolutely
irreverent
what
a
splendid
scolding
the
new
visitor
exclaimed
when
on
the
entrance
of
the
pope
legate
her
companion
closed
the
book
on
the
scene
peter
pressed
his
lips
to
madame
carré
the
old
actress
got
up
and
held
out
her
arms
to
miriam
the
girl
never
took
her
eyes
off
sherringham
while
she
passed
into
that
lady
embrace
and
remained
there
they
were
full
of
their
usual
sombre
fire
and
it
was
always
the
case
that
they
expressed
too
much
anything
they
could
express
at
all
but
they
were
not
defiant
nor
even
triumphant
now
they
were
only
deeply
explicative
they
seemed
to
say
that
the
sort
of
thing
i
meant
that
what
i
had
in
mind
when
i
asked
you
to
try
to
do
something
for
me
madame
carré
folded
her
pupil
to
her
bosom
holding
her
there
as
the
old
marquise
in
a
de
might
in
the
last
scene
have
held
her
the
have
you
got
me
an
engagement
the
young
woman
then
appealed
eagerly
to
her
friend
yes
he
has
done
something
splendid
for
me
she
went
on
to
madame
carré
resting
her
hand
caressingly
on
one
of
the
while
the
old
woman
discoursed
with
dashwood
who
was
telling
her
in
very
pretty
french
that
he
was
tremendously
excited
about
miss
rooth
madame
carré
looked
at
him
as
if
she
wondered
how
he
appeared
when
he
was
calm
and
how
as
a
dramatic
artist
he
expressed
that
condition
yes
yes
something
splendid
for
a
beginning
peter
answered
radiantly
recklessly
feeling
now
only
that
he
would
say
anything
and
do
anything
to
please
her
he
spent
on
the
spot
in
imagination
his
last
penny
it
such
a
pity
you
could
follow
it
you
have
liked
it
so
much
better
dashwood
observed
to
their
hostess
could
follow
it
do
you
take
me
for
the
celebrated
artist
cried
i
suspect
i
followed
it
plus
près
que
vous
ah
you
see
the
language
is
so
awfully
fine
basil
dashwood
replied
looking
at
his
shoes
the
language
why
she
rails
like
a
is
that
what
you
call
language
ours
is
another
business
if
you
understood
if
you
understood
you
see
all
the
greatness
of
it
miriam
declared
and
then
in
another
tone
such
delicious
expressions
dit
que
but
who
can
tell
if
you
really
say
it
madame
carré
demanded
ah
i
can
sherringham
answered
oh
you
you
a
frenchman
could
he
make
it
out
if
he
were
asked
basil
dashwood
the
old
woman
shrugged
her
shoulders
he
would
know
that
flattering
to
me
oh
you
do
you
pretend
to
complain
madame
carré
said
i
prefer
imprecations
those
of
camille
she
went
on
they
have
the
beauty
plus
belles
i
can
say
them
too
miriam
broke
in
smiled
madame
carré
camille
does
squat
down
on
the
floor
in
the
middle
of
them
for
grief
is
proud
and
makes
his
owner
stoop
to
me
and
to
the
state
of
my
great
grief
let
kings
assemble
miriam
quickly
declaimed
ah
if
you
do
feel
the
way
she
makes
a
throne
of
it
it
really
tremendously
fine
sherringham
said
there
nothing
like
it
êtes
the
old
woman
answered
stay
with
us
i
teach
you
phèdre
ah
phædra
phædra
basil
dashwood
vaguely
ejaculated
looking
more
gentlemanly
than
ever
you
learned
all
i
taught
you
but
where
the
devil
have
you
learned
what
i
have
madame
carré
went
on
i
worked
i
have
you
call
it
work
all
through
the
bright
late
summer
all
through
the
hot
dull
empty
days
i
battered
down
the
door
i
did
hear
it
crash
one
day
but
i
not
so
very
good
yet
only
in
the
right
direction
growled
madame
carré
oh
i
can
beat
that
the
girl
went
on
did
you
wake
up
one
morning
and
find
you
had
grown
a
pair
of
wings
peter
asked
because
that
what
the
difference
amounts
to
you
really
soar
moreover
you
an
angel
he
added
charmed
with
her
unexpectedness
the
good
nature
of
her
forbearance
to
reproach
him
for
not
having
written
to
her
and
it
seemed
to
him
privately
that
she
angelic
when
in
answer
to
this
she
said
ever
so
blandly
you
know
you
read
with
me
before
you
went
away
i
thought
over
immensely
what
you
said
i
did
understand
it
much
at
the
time
i
was
so
stupid
but
it
all
came
to
me
later
i
wish
you
could
see
yourself
peter
returned
my
dear
fellow
i
do
what
sort
of
a
dunce
do
you
take
me
for
i
miss
a
vibration
of
my
voice
a
fold
of
my
robe
well
i
did
see
you
troubling
about
it
peter
handsomely
insisted
no
one
ever
will
do
you
think
i
ever
show
it
celare
basil
dashwood
jocosely
dropped
you
must
first
have
the
art
to
hide
said
sherringham
wondering
a
little
why
miriam
did
introduce
her
young
friend
to
him
she
was
however
both
then
and
later
perfectly
neglectful
of
such
cares
never
thinking
never
minding
how
other
people
got
on
together
when
she
found
they
did
get
on
she
jeered
at
them
that
was
the
nearest
she
came
to
arranging
for
them
our
young
man
noted
in
her
from
the
moment
she
felt
her
strength
an
immense
increase
of
this
inattention
to
detail
all
detail
save
that
of
her
work
to
which
she
was
ready
to
sacrifice
holocausts
of
feelings
when
the
feelings
were
other
people
this
conferred
on
her
a
large
profanity
an
absence
of
ceremony
as
to
her
social
relations
which
was
both
amusing
because
it
suggested
that
she
would
take
what
she
gave
and
formidable
because
it
was
inconvenient
and
you
might
care
to
give
what
she
would
take
if
you
have
any
art
it
not
quite
the
same
as
if
you
did
hide
it
is
it
basil
dashwood
ingeniously
threw
out
that
right
say
one
of
your
clever
things
miriam
sweetly
responded
you
always
acting
he
declared
in
english
and
with
a
laugh
while
sherringham
remained
struck
with
his
expressing
just
what
he
himself
had
felt
weeks
before
and
when
you
shown
them
your
to
your
public
what
will
you

big
bill

sherringham

a
friendly
but
discriminating
manner

and
juliet
take
care

do
mix
them
said
sherringham
i
want

be
various
you
once
told
me

a
hundred
characters
miriam
returned
ah
en
êtes
cried
the
old
actress
you
may
have
a
hundred
characters
but
you
only
three
plays
i
told
that
all
there
are
in
english
miriam
admirably
indifferent
to
this
charge
appealed
to
peter
what
arrangements
have
you
made
what
do
the
people
want
the
people
at
the
theatre
i
afraid
they
do
want
and
i
do
believe
they
hunger
for
and
basil
dashwood
suggested
ships
and
sieges
and
armies
and
pyramids
you
know
we
must
be
too
heavy
oh
i
hate
scenery
the
girl
sighed
est
said
madame
carré
you
must
put
those
pieces
on
the
stage
how
will
you
do
it
oh
we
know
how
to
get
up
a
play
in
london
madame
carré
dashwood
was
all
geniality
they
put
money
on
it
you
know
on
it
but
what
do
they
put
it
who
interpret
them
manage
a
style
like
that
the
style
of
which
the
rhapsodies
she
has
just
repeated
are
a
specimen
whom
have
you
got
that
one
has
ever
heard
of
oh
you
hear
of
a
good
deal
when
once
she
gets
started
dashwood
cheerfully
contended
madame
carré
looked
at
him
a
moment
then
i
feel
that
you
become
very
bad
she
said
to
miriam
i
glad
i
sha
see
it
people
will
do
things
for
me
i
make
them
the
girl
declared
stir
them
up
so
that
they
have
ideas
what
people
pray
ah
terrible
woman
peter
theatrically
groaned
we
translate
your
pieces
there
will
be
plenty
of
parts
basil
dashwood
said
why
then
go
out
of
the
door
to
come
in
at
the
window
especially
if
you
smash
it
an
english
arrangement
of
a
french
piece
is
a
pretty
woman
with
her
back
turned
do
you
really
want
to
keep
her
sherringham
asked
of
madame
carré
quite
as
if
thinking
for
a
moment
that
this
after
all
might
be
possible
she
bent
her
strange
eyes
on
him
no
you
all
too
queer
together
we
could
be
bothered
with
you
and
you
not
worth
it
i
glad
it
that
we
queer
then
we
can
console
each
other
if
you
only
would
but
you
do
seem
to
in
short
i
do
understand
you
i
give
you
up
but
it
does
matter
said
the
old
woman
wearily
for
the
theatre
dead
and
even
you
wo
bring
it
to
life
everything
going
from
bad
to
worse
and
i
do
care
what
becomes
of
you
you
would
understand
us
here
and
they
understand
you
there
and
everything
impossible
and
no
one
a
whit
the
wiser
and
it
not
of
the
least
consequence
only
when
you
raise
your
arms
lift
them
just
a
little
higher
madame
carré
added
my
mother
will
be
happier
said
miriam
throwing
her
arms
straight
up
and
giving
them
a
noble
tragic
movement
you
wo
be
in
the
least
in
the
right
path
till
your
mother
in
despair
well
perhaps
we
can
bring
that
about
even
in
london
sherringham
patiently
laughed
dear
rooth
she
great
fun
dashwood
as
imperturbably
dropped
miriam
transferred
the
dark
weight
of
her
gaze
to
him
as
if
she
were
practising
wo
upset
her
at
any
rate
then
she
stood
with
her
beautiful
and
fatal
mask
before
her
hostess
i
want
to
do
the
modern
too
i
want
to
do
with
intense
realistic
effects
and
do
you
want
to
look
like
the
portico
of
the
madeleine
when
draped
for
a
funeral
her
instructress
mocked
never
never
i
believe
you
various
that
not
the
way
i
see
you
you
pure
tragedy
with
grands
éclats
de
in
the
great
style
or
nothing
be
beautiful
be
only
that
peter
urged
with
high
interest
be
only
what
you
can
be
so
well
something
that
one
may
turn
to
for
a
glimpse
of
perfection
to
lift
one
out
of
all
the
vulgarities
of
the
day
thus
apostrophised
the
girl
broke
out
with
one
of
the
speeches
of
racine
phædra
hushing
her
companions
on
the
instant
you
be
the
english
rachel
said
basil
dashwood
when
she
stopped
acting
in
french
madame
carré
amended
i
do
believe
in
an
english
rachel
i
shall
have
to
work
it
out
what
i
shall
be
miriam
concluded
with
a
rich
pensive
effect
you
in
wonderfully
good
form
sherringham
said
to
her
his
appreciation
revealing
a
personal
subjection
he
was
unable
to
conceal
from
his
companions
much
as
he
wished
it
i
really
mean
to
do
everything
very
well
after
all
garrick
did
then
i
shall
be
the
garrick
of
my
sex
there
a
very
clever
author
doing
something
for
me
i
should
like
you
to
see
it
said
basil
dashwood
addressing
himself
equally
to
miriam
and
to
her
diplomatic
friend
ah
if
you
very
clever
authors
and
madame
carré
spun
the
sound
to
the
finest
satiric
thread
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
see
it
peter
returned
this
response
was
so
benevolent
that
basil
dashwood
presently
began
may
i
ask
you
at
what
theatre
you
made
arrangements
sherringham
looked
at
him
a
moment
come
and
see
me
at
the
embassy
and
i
tell
you
then
he
added
i
know
your
sister
mrs
lovick
so
i
supposed
that
why
i
took
the
liberty
of
asking
such
a
question
it
no
liberty
but
sherringham
does
appear
to
be
able
to
tell
you
said
miriam
well
you
know
it
a
very
curious
world
all
those
theatrical
people
over
there
peter
conceded
ah
do
say
anything
against
them
when
i
one
of
them
basil
dashwood
laughed
i
might
plead
the
absence
of
information
peter
returned
as
miss
rooth
has
neglected
to
make
us
acquainted
miriam
vaguely
smiled
i
know
you
both
so
little
but
she
presented
them
with
a
great
stately
air
to
each
other
and
the
two
men
shook
hands
while
madame
carré
observed
them
you
gentlemen
meet
here
for
the
first
time
you
do
right
to
become
friends
that
the
best
thing
live
together
in
peace
and
mutual
confidence
de
beaucoup
le
plus
certainly
for
said
sherringham
he
began
the
next
moment
to
repeat
to
his
new
acquaintance
some
of
the
things
he
had
been
told
in
london
but
their
hostess
stopped
him
off
waving
the
talk
away
with
charming
overdone
stage
horror
and
the
young
hands
of
the
heroines
of
marivaux
ah
wait
till
you
go
for
that
do
you
suppose
i
care
for
news
of
your
mountebanks
booths
xx
as
many
people
know
there
are
not
in
the
famous
théâtre
français
more
than
a
dozen
good
seats
accessible
to
ladies
the
stalls
are
forbidden
them
the
boxes
are
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
stage
and
the
balcony
is
a
delusion
save
for
a
few
chairs
at
either
end
of
its
vast
horseshoe
but
there
are
two
excellent
which
indeed
are
by
no
means
always
to
be
had
it
was
however
into
one
of
them
that
immediately
after
his
return
to
paris
sherringham
ushered
rooth
and
her
daughter
with
the
further
escort
of
basil
dashwood
he
had
chosen
the
evening
of
the
reappearance
of
the
celebrated
mademoiselle
voisin
she
had
been
enjoying
a
of
three
months
an
actress
whom
miriam
had
seen
several
times
before
and
for
whose
method
she
professed
a
high
though
somewhat
critical
esteem
it
was
only
for
the
return
of
this
charming
performer
that
peter
had
been
waiting
to
respond
to
miriam
most
ardent
wish
that
of
spending
an
hour
in
the
des
of
the
great
theatre
she
was
the
person
whom
he
knew
best
in
the
house
of
molière
he
could
count
on
her
to
do
them
the
honours
some
night
when
she
was
in
the
bill
and
to
make
the
occasion
sociable
miriam
had
been
impatient
for
it
she
was
so
convinced
that
her
eyes
would
be
opened
in
the
holy
of
holies
but
wishing
as
particularly
as
he
did
to
participate
in
her
impression
he
had
made
her
promise
she
would
taste
of
this
experience
without
him
not
let
madame
carré
for
instance
take
her
in
his
absence
there
were
questions
the
girl
wished
to
put
to
mademoiselle
voisin
questions
which
having
admired
her
from
the
balcony
she
felt
she
was
exactly
the
person
to
answer
she
was
more
in
it
now
after
all
than
madame
carré
in
spite
of
her
slenderer
talent
she
was
younger
fresher
more
modern
and
miriam
found
the
word
less
academic
she
was
in
fine
less
peter
perfectly
foresaw
the
day
when
his
young
friend
would
make
indulgent
allowances
for
poor
madame
carré
patronising
her
as
an
old
woman
of
good
intentions
the
play
was
six
months
old
a
large
serious
successful
comedy
by
the
most
distinguished
of
authors
with
a
thesis
a
chorus
embodied
in
one
character
a
à
and
a
part
full
of
opportunities
for
mademoiselle
voisin
there
were
things
to
be
said
about
this
artist
strictures
to
be
dropped
as
to
the
general
quality
of
her
art
and
miriam
leaned
back
now
making
her
comments
as
if
they
cost
her
less
but
the
actress
had
knowledge
and
distinction
and
pathos
and
our
young
lady
repeated
several
times
how
quiet
she
is
how
wonderfully
quiet
scarcely
anything
moves
but
her
face
and
her
voice
geste
but
really
expressive
when
it
comes
i
like
that
economy
it
the
only
way
to
make
the
gesture
significant
i
do
admire
the
way
she
holds
her
arms
basil
dash
wood
said
like
a
de
trying
on
a
jacket
well
she
holds
them
at
any
rate
i
daresay
it
more
than
you
do
with
yours
oh
yes
she
holds
them
there
no
mistake
about
that
hold
them
i
hope
she
seems
to
say
to
all
the
house
the
young
english
professional
laughed
and
sherringham
was
struck
with
the
pleasant
familiarity
he
had
established
with
their
brave
companion
he
was
knowing
and
ready
and
he
said
in
the
first
they
were
waiting
for
the
second
to
go
behind
amusing
perceptive
things
they
teach
them
to
be
ladylike
and
voisin
always
trying
to
show
that
how
i
walk
see
how
i
sit
see
how
quiet
i
am
and
how
i
have
geste
now
can
you
say
i
ai
a
lady
she
does
it
all
as
if
she
had
a
class
well
i
her
class
said
miriam
oh
i
do
mean
of
actresses
but
of
du
she
shows
them
how
to
act
in
society
you
had
better
take
a
few
lessons
miriam
retorted
ah
you
should
see
voisin
in
society
peter
interposed
does
she
go
into
it
rooth
demanded
with
interest
her
friend
hesitated
she
receives
a
great
many
people
why
should
they
when
they
nice
rooth
frankly
wanted
to
know
when
the
people
are
nice
miriam
asked
now
do
tell
me
she
not
what
one
would
wish
said
rooth
to
sherringham
it
depends
on
what
that
is
he
darkly
smiled
what
i
should
wish
if
she
were
my
daughter
the
old
woman
rejoined
blandly
ah
wish
your
daughter
to
act
as
well
as
that
and
you
do
the
handsome
thing
for
her
well
she
to
feel
what
she
says
rooth
piously
risked
she
has
some
stiff
things
to
say
i
mean
about
her
past
basil
dashwood
remarked
the
past
the
dreadful
past
on
the
stage
wait
till
the
end
to
see
how
she
comes
out
we
must
all
be
merciful
sighed
rooth
we
seen
it
before
you
know
what
happens
miriam
observed
to
her
mother
i
seen
so
many
i
get
them
mixed
yes
they
all
in
queer
predicaments
poor
old
mother
what
we
show
you
laughed
the
girl
ah
it
will
be
what
show
me
something
noble
and
wise
i
want
to
do
this
it
a
magnificent
part
said
miriam
you
could
put
it
on
in
london
they
would
swallow
it
basil
dashwood
declared
are
there
things
they
do
there
to
get
over
the
difficulties
the
girl
inquired
you
ca
get
over
what
her
companion
had
a
rueful
grimace
yes
we
must
pay
we
must
expiate
rooth
moaned
as
the
curtain
rose
again
when
the
second
act
was
over
our
friends
passed
out
of
their
into
those
corridors
of
tribulation
where
the
bristling
like
a
pawnbroker
driving
a
roaring
trade
mounts
guard
upon
piles
of
heterogeneous
clothing
and
gaining
the
top
of
the
fine
staircase
which
forms
the
state
entrance
and
connects
the
statued
vestibule
of
the
basement
with
the
grand
tier
of
boxes
opened
an
ambiguous
door
composed
of
little
mirrors
and
found
themselves
in
the
society
of
the
initiated
the
janitors
were
courteous
folk
who
greeted
sherringham
as
an
acquaintance
and
he
had
no
difficulty
in
marshalling
his
little
troop
toward
the
foyer
they
traversed
a
low
curving
lobby
hung
with
pictures
and
furnished
with
benches
where
several
unrecognised
persons
of
both
sexes
looked
at
them
without
hostility
and
arrived
at
an
opening
on
the
right
from
which
by
a
short
flight
of
steps
there
was
a
descent
to
one
of
the
wings
of
the
stage
here
miriam
paused
in
silent
excitement
like
a
young
warrior
arrested
by
a
glimpse
of
the
her
vision
was
carried
off
through
a
lane
of
light
to
the
point
of
vantage
from
which
the
actor
held
the
house
but
there
was
a
hushed
guard
over
the
place
and
curiosity
could
only
glance
and
pass
then
she
came
with
her
companions
to
a
sort
of
parlour
with
a
polished
floor
not
large
and
rather
vacant
where
her
attention
flew
delightedly
to
a
in
a
corner
from
which
three
or
four
dresses
were
suspended
dresses
she
immediately
perceived
to
be
costumes
in
that
night
play
accompanied
by
a
saucer
of
something
and
a
casually
left
on
a
sofa
this
was
a
familiar
note
in
the
general
impression
of
high
decorum
which
had
begun
at
the
threshold
a
sense
of
majesty
in
the
place
miriam
rushed
at
the
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
snatched
it
up
and
gazed
at
it
with
droll
veneration
then
stood
rapt
a
moment
before
the
charming
petticoats
that
dunoyer
first
underskirt
she
said
to
her
mother
while
sherringham
explained
that
in
this
apartment
an
actress
traditionally
changed
her
gown
when
the
transaction
was
simple
enough
to
save
the
long
ascent
to
her
he
felt
himself
a
cicerone
showing
a
church
to
a
party
of
provincials
and
indeed
there
was
a
grave
hospitality
in
the
air
mingled
with
something
academic
and
important
the
tone
of
an
institution
a
temple
which
made
them
all
out
of
respect
and
delicacy
hold
their
breath
a
little
and
tread
the
shining
floors
with
discretion
these
precautions
increased
rooth
crept
about
like
a
friendly
but
undomesticated
cat
after
they
entered
the
foyer
itself
a
square
spacious
saloon
covered
with
pictures
and
relics
and
draped
in
official
green
velvet
where
the
holds
a
reception
every
night
in
the
year
the
effect
was
freshly
charming
to
peter
he
was
fond
of
the
place
always
saw
it
again
with
pleasure
enjoyed
its
honourable
look
and
the
way
among
the
portraits
and
scrolls
the
records
of
a
splendid
history
the
green
velvet
and
the
waxed
floors
the
seemed
to
be
at
home
in
the
quiet
lamplight
at
the
end
of
the
room
in
an
ample
chimney
blazed
a
fire
of
logs
miriam
said
nothing
they
looked
about
noting
that
most
of
the
portraits
and
pictures
were
and
basil
dashwood
expressed
disappointment
at
the
absence
of
all
the
people
they
wanted
most
to
see
three
or
four
gentlemen
in
evening
dress
circulated
slowly
looking
like
themselves
at
the
pictures
and
another
gentleman
stood
before
a
lady
with
whom
he
was
in
conversation
seated
against
the
wall
the
foyer
resembled
in
these
conditions
a
cleared
for
the
dance
before
the
guests
or
the
music
had
arrived
oh
it
enough
to
see
it
makes
my
heart
beat
said
miriam
it
full
of
the
vanished
past
it
makes
me
cry
i
feel
them
here
all
the
great
artists
i
shall
never
see
think
of
rachel
look
at
her
grand
portrait
there
and
how
she
stood
on
these
very
boards
and
trailed
over
them
the
robes
of
hermione
and
phèdre
the
girl
broke
out
theatrically
as
on
the
spot
was
right
not
a
bit
afraid
of
her
voice
as
soon
as
it
rolled
through
the
room
appealing
to
her
companions
as
they
stood
under
the
chandelier
and
making
the
other
persons
present
who
had
already
given
her
some
attention
turn
round
to
stare
at
so
unusual
a
specimen
of
the
english
miss
she
laughed
musically
when
she
noticed
this
and
her
mother
scandalised
begged
her
to
lower
her
tone
it
all
right
i
produce
an
effect
said
miriam
it
sha
be
said
that
i
too
had
my
little
success
in
the
maison
de
molière
and
sherringham
repeated
that
it
was
all
right
the
place
was
familiar
with
mirth
and
passion
there
was
often
wonderful
talk
there
and
it
was
only
the
setting
that
was
still
and
solemn
it
happened
that
this
evening
there
was
no
knowing
in
advance
the
scene
was
not
characteristically
brilliant
but
to
confirm
his
assertion
at
the
moment
he
spoke
mademoiselle
dunoyer
who
was
also
in
the
play
came
into
the
room
attended
by
a
pair
of
gentlemen
she
was
the
celebrated
the
perpetual
the
necessary
who
with
all
her
talent
could
have
represented
a
woman
of
her
actual
age
she
had
the
gliding
hopping
movement
of
a
small
bird
the
same
air
of
having
nothing
to
do
with
time
and
the
clear
sure
piercing
note
a
miracle
of
exact
vocalisation
she
chaffed
her
companions
she
chaffed
the
room
she
might
have
been
a
very
clever
little
girl
trying
to
personate
a
more
innocent
big
one
she
scattered
her
amiability
about
showing
miriam
how
the
children
of
molière
took
their
ease
and
it
quickly
placed
her
in
the
friendliest
communication
with
peter
sherringham
who
already
enjoyed
her
acquaintance
and
who
now
extended
it
to
his
companions
and
in
particular
to
the
young
lady
le
point
au
you
deserve
a
happier
lot
said
the
actress
looking
up
at
miriam
brightly
as
if
to
a
great
height
and
taking
her
in
upon
which
sherringham
left
them
together
a
little
and
led
rooth
and
young
dashwood
to
consider
further
some
of
the
pictures
most
delightful
most
curious
the
old
woman
murmured
about
everything
while
basil
dashwood
exclaimed
in
the
presence
of
most
of
the
portraits
but
their
ugliness
their
ugliness
did
you
ever
see
such
a
collection
of
hideous
people
and
those
who
were
supposed
to
be
the
beauties
of
the
past
they
worse
than
the
others
ah
you
may
say
what
you
will
sommes
mieux
que
sherringham
suspected
him
of
irritation
of
not
liking
the
theatre
of
the
great
rival
nation
to
be
thrust
down
his
throat
they
returned
to
miriam
and
mademoiselle
dunoyer
and
peter
asked
the
actress
a
question
about
one
of
the
portraits
to
which
there
was
no
name
attached
she
replied
like
a
child
who
had
only
played
about
the
room
that
she
was
not
to
be
able
to
tell
him
the
original
she
had
forgotten
she
had
never
asked
allez
me
trouver
bien
she
appealed
to
the
other
persons
present
who
formed
a
gallery
for
her
and
laughed
in
delightful
ripples
at
their
suggestions
which
she
covered
with
ridicule
she
bestirred
herself
she
declared
she
would
ascertain
she
should
be
happy
till
she
did
and
swam
out
of
the
room
with
the
prettiest
paddles
to
obtain
the
information
leaving
behind
her
a
perfume
of
delicate
kindness
and
gaiety
she
seemed
above
all
things
obliging
and
peter
pronounced
her
almost
as
natural
off
the
stage
as
on
she
did
come
back
xxi
whether
he
had
prearranged
it
is
more
than
i
can
say
but
mademoiselle
voisin
delayed
so
long
to
show
herself
that
rooth
who
wished
to
see
the
rest
of
the
play
though
she
had
sat
it
out
on
another
occasion
expressed
a
returning
relish
for
her
corner
of
the
and
gave
her
conductor
the
best
pretext
he
could
have
desired
for
asking
basil
dashwood
to
be
so
good
as
to
escort
her
back
when
the
young
actor
of
whose
personal
preference
peter
was
quite
aware
had
led
rooth
away
with
an
absence
of
moroseness
which
showed
that
his
striking
resemblance
to
a
gentleman
was
not
kept
for
the
footlights
the
two
others
sat
on
a
divan
in
the
part
of
the
room
furthest
from
the
entrance
so
that
it
gave
them
a
degree
of
privacy
and
miriam
watched
the
coming
and
going
of
their
and
the
indefinite
people
attached
to
the
theatre
hanging
about
while
her
companion
gave
a
name
to
some
of
the
figures
parisian
celebrities
fancy
poor
dashwood
cooped
up
there
with
mamma
the
girl
exclaimed
whimsically
you
awfully
cruel
to
him
but
that
of
course
said
sherringham
it
seems
to
me
i
as
kind
as
you
you
sent
him
off
that
was
for
your
mother
she
was
tired
oh
gammon
and
why
if
i
cruel
should
it
be
of
course
because
you
must
destroy
and
torment
and
wear
out
that
your
nature
but
you
ca
help
your
type
can
you
my
type
she
echoed
it
bad
perverse
dangerous
it
essentially
insolent
and
pray
what
yours
when
you
talk
like
that
would
you
say
such
things
if
you
did
know
the
depths
of
my
good
nature
your
good
nature
all
comes
back
to
that
said
sherringham
it
an
abyss
of
ruin
for
others
you
no
respect
i
speaking
of
the
artistic
character
in
the
direction
and
in
the
plentitude
in
which
you
have
it
it
unscrupulous
nervous
capricious
wanton
i
do
know
about
respect
one
can
be
good
miriam
mused
and
reasoned
it
does
matter
so
long
as
one
powerful
he
returned
we
have
everything
and
surely
we
ought
to
understand
that
we
must
pay
for
things
a
splendid
organisation
for
a
special
end
like
yours
is
so
rare
and
rich
and
fine
that
we
ought
to
grudge
it
its
conditions
what
do
you
call
its
conditions
miriam
asked
as
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
oh
the
need
to
take
its
ease
to
take
up
space
to
make
itself
at
home
in
the
world
to
square
its
elbows
and
knock
others
about
that
large
and
free
it
the
good
nature
you
speak
of
you
must
forage
and
ravage
and
leave
a
track
behind
you
you
must
live
upon
the
country
you
traverse
and
you
give
such
delight
that
after
all
welcome
you
infinitely
welcome
i
do
know
what
you
mean
i
only
care
for
the
idea
the
girl
said
that
exactly
what
i
pretend
and
we
must
all
help
you
to
it
you
use
us
you
push
us
about
you
break
us
up
we
your
tables
and
chair
the
simple
furniture
of
your
life
whom
do
you
mean
by
peter
gave
an
ironic
laugh
oh
do
be
afraid
there
will
be
plenty
of
others
she
made
no
return
to
this
but
after
a
moment
broke
out
again
poor
dashwood
immured
with
mamma
he
like
a
lame
chair
that
one
has
put
into
the
corner
do
break
him
up
before
he
has
served
i
really
believe
something
will
come
out
of
him
her
companion
went
on
however
you
break
me
up
first
he
added
and
him
probably
never
at
all
and
why
shall
i
honour
you
so
much
more
because
i
a
better
article
and
you
feel
that
you
the
superiority
of
modesty
i
see
i
better
than
a
young
mountebank
i
vanity
enough
to
say
that
she
turned
on
him
with
a
flush
in
her
cheek
and
a
splendid
dramatic
face
how
you
hate
us
yes
at
bottom
below
your
little
cold
taste
you
us
she
repeated
he
coloured
too
met
her
eyes
looked
into
them
a
minute
seemed
to
accept
the
imputation
and
then
said
quickly
give
it
up
come
away
with
me
come
away
with
you
leave
this
place
give
it
up
you
brought
me
here
you
insisted
it
should
be
only
you
and
now
you
must
stay
she
declared
with
a
and
a
high
manner
you
should
know
what
you
want
dear
mr
sherringham
i
do
i
know
now
come
away
before
you
see
her
before
she
seemed
to
wonder
she
success
this
wonderful
voisin
she
triumph
she
full
accomplishment
the
hard
brilliant
realisation
of
what
i
want
to
avert
for
you
miriam
looked
at
him
in
silence
the
cold
light
still
in
her
face
and
he
repeated
give
it
up
give
it
up
her
eyes
softened
after
a
little
she
smiled
and
then
said
yes
better
than
poor
dashwood
give
it
up
and
we
live
for
ourselves
in
ourselves
in
something
that
can
have
a
sanctity
all
the
same
you
do
hate
us
the
girl
went
on
i
do
want
to
be
conceited
but
i
mean
that
i
sufficiently
fine
and
complicated
to
tempt
you
i
an
expensive
modern
watch
with
a
wonderful
escapement
therefore
you
smash
me
if
you
can
never
never
she
said
as
she
got
up
you
tell
me
the
hour
too
well
she
quitted
her
companion
and
stood
looking
at
gérôme
fine
portrait
of
the
pale
rachel
invested
with
the
antique
attributes
of
tragedy
the
rise
of
the
curtain
had
drawn
away
most
of
the
company
peter
from
his
bench
watched
his
friend
a
little
turning
his
eyes
from
her
to
the
vivid
image
of
the
dead
actress
and
thinking
how
little
she
suffered
by
the
juxtaposition
presently
he
came
over
and
joined
her
again
and
she
resumed
i
wonder
if
that
what
your
cousin
had
in
his
mind
my
cousin
what
was
his
name
dormer
that
first
day
at
madame
carré
he
offered
to
paint
my
portrait
i
remember
i
put
him
up
to
it
was
he
thinking
of
this
i
doubt
if
he
has
ever
seen
it
i
daresay
i
was
well
when
we
go
to
london
he
must
do
it
said
miriam
oh
there
no
hurry
peter
was
moved
to
reply
do
you
want
my
picture
asked
the
girl
with
one
of
her
successful
touches
i
not
sure
i
want
it
from
i
do
know
quite
what
he
make
of
you
he
looked
so
clever
i
liked
him
i
saw
him
again
at
your
party
he
a
jolly
good
fellow
but
what
one
to
say
peter
put
to
her
of
a
painter
who
goes
for
his
inspiration
to
the
house
of
commons
to
the
house
of
commons
she
echoed
he
has
lately
got
himself
elected
dear
me
what
a
pity
i
wanted
to
sit
for
him
but
perhaps
he
have
me
as
i
not
a
member
of
parliament
it
my
sister
rather
who
has
got
him
in
your
sister
who
was
at
your
house
that
day
what
has
she
to
do
with
it
miriam
asked
why
she
his
cousin
just
as
i
am
and
in
addition
sherringham
went
on
she
to
be
married
to
him
married
really
she
had
a
pause
but
she
continued
so
he
paints
i
suppose
not
much
probably
his
talent
in
that
line
is
what
she
esteems
in
him
most
it
is
great
then
i
have
the
least
idea
and
in
the
political
line
the
girl
persisted
i
scarcely
can
tell
he
very
clever
he
does
paint
decently
then
i
daresay
miriam
looked
once
more
at
gérôme
picture
fancy
his
going
into
the
house
of
commons
and
your
sister
put
him
there
she
worked
she
canvassed
ah
you
a
queer
family
she
sighed
turning
round
at
the
sound
of
a
step
we
lost
here
mademoiselle
voisin
said
sherringham
this
celebrity
presented
herself
smiling
and
addressing
miriam
i
acted
for
i
did
my
best
what
a
pleasure
to
speak
to
you
to
thank
you
the
girl
murmured
admiringly
she
was
startled
and
dazzled
i
could
come
to
you
before
but
now
i
got
a
rest
for
half
an
hour
the
actress
went
on
gracious
and
passive
as
if
a
little
spent
she
let
sherringham
without
looking
at
him
take
her
hand
and
raise
it
to
his
lips
i
sorry
i
make
you
lose
the
others
they
so
good
in
this
act
she
added
we
seen
them
before
and
there
nothing
so
good
as
you
miriam
promptly
returned
i
like
my
part
said
mademoiselle
voisin
gently
smiling
still
at
our
young
lady
with
clear
charming
eyes
one
always
better
in
that
case
she
so
bad
sometimes
you
know
peter
jested
to
miriam
leading
the
actress
thus
to
glance
at
him
kindly
and
vaguely
in
a
short
silence
which
you
could
call
on
her
part
embarrassment
but
which
was
still
less
affectation
and
it
so
interesting
to
be
here
so
interesting
miriam
protested
ah
you
like
our
old
house
yes
we
very
proud
of
it
and
mademoiselle
voisin
smiled
again
at
sherringham
all
but
as
if
to
say
well
here
i
am
and
what
do
you
want
of
me
do
ask
me
to
invent
it
myself
but
if
you
tell
me
i
do
it
miriam
admired
the
note
of
discreet
interrogation
in
her
voice
the
slight
suggestion
of
surprise
at
their
old
house
being
liked
this
performer
was
an
astonishment
from
her
seeming
still
more
perfect
on
a
nearer
view
which
was
not
the
girl
had
an
idea
what
performers
usually
did
this
was
very
encouraging
to
her
it
widened
the
programme
of
a
young
lady
about
to
embrace
the
scenic
career
to
have
so
much
to
show
before
the
footlights
and
yet
to
have
so
much
left
when
you
came
off
that
was
really
wonderful
mademoiselle
voisin
eyes
as
one
looked
into
them
were
still
more
agreeable
than
the
distant
spectator
would
have
supposed
and
there
was
in
her
appearance
an
extreme
finish
which
instantly
suggested
to
miriam
that
she
herself
in
comparison
was
big
and
rough
and
coarse
you
lovely
you
particularly
lovely
sherringham
said
very
frankly
translating
miriam
own
impression
and
at
the
same
time
giving
her
an
illustration
of
the
way
that
in
paris
at
least
gentlemen
expressed
themselves
to
the
stars
of
the
drama
she
thought
she
knew
her
companion
very
well
and
had
been
witness
of
the
degree
to
which
in
such
general
conditions
his
familiarity
could
increase
but
his
address
to
the
slim
distinguished
harmonious
woman
before
them
had
a
different
quality
the
note
of
a
special
usage
if
miriam
had
had
an
apprehension
that
such
directness
might
be
taken
as
excessive
it
was
removed
by
the
manner
in
which
mademoiselle
voisin
returned
oh
one
always
well
enough
when
one
made
up
one
always
exactly
the
same
that
served
as
an
example
of
the
good
taste
with
which
a
star
of
the
drama
could
receive
homage
that
was
wanting
in
originality
miriam
determined
on
the
spot
that
this
should
be
the
way
would
ever
receive
it
the
grace
of
her
new
acquaintance
was
the
greater
as
the
becoming
bloom
to
which
she
alluded
as
artificial
was
the
result
of
a
science
so
consummate
that
it
had
none
of
the
grossness
of
a
mask
the
perception
of
all
this
was
exciting
to
our
young
aspirant
and
her
excitement
relieved
itself
in
the
inquiry
which
struck
her
as
rude
as
soon
as
she
had
uttered
it
you
acted
for
how
did
you
know
what
am
i
to
you
monsieur
sherringham
has
told
me
about
you
he
says
we
nothing
beside
you
that
you
to
be
the
great
star
of
the
future
i
proud
that
you
seen
me
that
of
course
is
what
i
tell
every
one
peter
acknowledged
a
trifle
awkwardly
to
miriam
i
can
believe
it
when
i
see
you
vous
ai
bien
the
actress
continued
in
her
sweet
conciliatory
tone
miriam
looked
from
one
of
her
interlocutors
to
the
other
as
if
there
were
joy
for
her
in
this
report
of
sherringham
remarks
joy
accompanied
and
partly
mitigated
however
by
a
quicker
vision
of
what
might
have
passed
between
a
secretary
of
embassy
and
a
creature
so
exquisite
as
mademoiselle
voisin
ah
you
wonderful
people
a
most
interesting
impression
she
yearningly
sighed
i
was
looking
for
you
he
had
prepared
me
we
such
old
friends
said
the
actress
in
a
tone
courteously
exempt
from
intention
upon
which
sherringham
again
taking
her
hand
raised
it
to
his
lips
with
a
tenderness
which
her
whole
appearance
seemed
to
bespeak
for
her
a
sort
of
practical
consideration
and
carefulness
of
touch
as
if
she
were
an
object
precious
and
frail
an
instrument
for
producing
rare
sounds
to
be
handled
like
a
legendary
violin
with
a
recognition
of
its
value
your
is
so
pretty
show
her
your
he
went
on
willingly
if
she
come
up
savez
que
une
montée
it
a
shame
to
inflict
it
on
miriam
objected
donc
if
it
will
interest
you
in
the
least
they
exchanged
civilities
almost
caresses
trying
which
could
have
the
nicest
manner
to
the
other
it
was
the
actress
manner
that
struck
miriam
most
it
denoted
such
a
training
so
much
taste
expressed
such
a
ripe
conception
of
urbanity
no
wonder
she
acts
well
when
she
has
that
tact
feels
perceives
is
so
remarkable
dieu
mon
dieu
the
girl
said
to
herself
as
they
followed
their
conductress
into
another
corridor
and
up
a
wide
plain
staircase
the
staircase
was
spacious
and
long
and
this
part
of
the
establishment
sombre
and
still
with
the
gravity
of
a
college
or
a
convent
they
reached
another
passage
lined
with
little
doors
on
each
of
which
the
name
of
a
comedian
was
painted
and
here
the
aspect
became
still
more
monastic
like
that
of
a
row
of
solitary
cells
mademoiselle
voisin
led
the
way
to
her
own
door
all
obligingly
and
as
if
wishing
to
be
hospitable
she
dropped
little
subdued
friendly
attempts
at
explanation
on
the
way
at
her
threshold
the
monasticism
stopped
miriam
found
herself
in
a
wonderfully
upholstered
nook
a
nest
of
lamplight
and
delicate
cretonne
save
for
its
pair
of
long
glasses
it
might
have
been
a
tiny
boudoir
with
a
drawing
of
value
in
each
of
its
panels
of
stretched
stuff
with
its
crackling
fire
and
its
charming
order
it
was
intensely
bright
and
extremely
hot
singularly
pretty
and
exempt
from
litter
nothing
lay
about
but
a
small
draped
doorway
led
into
an
inner
sanctuary
to
miriam
it
seemed
royal
it
immediately
made
the
art
of
the
comedian
the
most
distinguished
thing
in
the
world
it
was
just
such
a
place
as
they
have
for
their
intervals
if
they
were
expected
to
be
great
artists
it
was
a
result
of
the
same
evolution
as
mademoiselle
voisin
herself
not
that
our
young
lady
found
this
particular
term
at
hand
to
express
her
idea
but
her
mind
was
flooded
with
an
impression
of
style
of
refinement
of
the
long
continuity
of
a
tradition
the
actress
said
voilà
tout
as
if
it
were
little
enough
and
there
were
even
something
clumsy
in
her
having
brought
them
so
far
for
nothing
and
in
their
all
sitting
there
waiting
and
looking
at
each
other
till
it
was
time
for
her
to
change
her
dress
but
to
miriam
it
was
occupation
enough
to
note
what
she
did
and
said
these
things
and
her
whole
person
and
carriage
struck
our
young
woman
as
exquisite
in
their
adaptation
to
the
particular
occasion
she
had
had
an
idea
that
foreign
actresses
were
rather
of
the
order
but
her
hostess
suggested
to
her
much
more
a
princess
than
a
she
would
do
things
as
she
liked
and
do
them
straight
off
miriam
fancy
her
in
the
gropings
and
humiliations
of
rehearsal
everything
in
her
had
been
sifted
and
formed
her
tone
was
perfect
her
amiability
complete
and
she
might
have
been
the
charming
young
wife
of
a
secretary
of
state
receiving
a
pair
of
strangers
of
distinction
the
girl
observed
all
her
movements
and
then
as
sherringham
had
said
she
was
particularly
lovely
but
she
suddenly
told
this
gentleman
that
she
must
put
him
la
she
wanted
to
change
her
dress
he
retired
and
returned
to
the
foyer
where
miriam
was
to
rejoin
him
after
remaining
the
few
minutes
more
with
mademoiselle
voisin
and
coming
down
with
her
he
waited
for
his
companion
walking
up
and
down
and
making
up
his
mind
and
when
she
presently
came
in
he
said
to
her
please
do
go
back
for
the
rest
of
the
play
stay
here
they
now
had
the
foyer
virtually
to
themselves
i
want
to
stay
here
i
like
it
better
she
moved
back
to
the
from
above
which
the
cold
portrait
of
rachel
looked
down
and
as
he
accompanied
her
he
went
on
i
meant
what
i
said
just
now
what
you
said
to
voisin
no
no
to
you
give
it
up
and
live
with
give
it
up
she
turned
her
stage
face
on
him
give
it
up
and
i
marry
you
this
is
a
happy
time
to
ask
it
she
said
with
superior
amusement
and
this
is
a
good
place
very
good
indeed
and
that
why
i
speak
it
a
place
to
make
one
choose
it
puts
it
all
before
one
to
make
choose
you
mean
i
much
obliged
but
that
not
my
choice
laughed
miriam
you
shall
be
anything
you
like
except
this
except
what
i
most
want
to
be
i
much
obliged
do
you
care
for
me
have
you
any
gratitude
sherringham
insisted
gratitude
for
kindly
removing
the
blest
cup
from
my
lips
i
want
to
be
what
is
i
want
it
more
than
ever
ah
what
she
is
he
took
it
impatiently
do
you
mean
i
ca
well
see
if
i
ca
tell
me
more
about
her
tell
me
everything
have
you
seen
for
yourself
and
knowing
things
as
you
do
ca
you
judge
she
strange
she
mysterious
miriam
allowed
looking
at
the
fire
she
showed
us
nothing
nothing
of
her
real
self
so
much
the
better
all
things
considered
are
there
all
sorts
of
other
things
in
her
life
that
what
i
believe
the
girl
went
on
raising
her
eyes
to
him
i
ca
tell
you
what
there
is
in
the
life
of
such
a
woman
imagine
when
she
so
perfect
she
exclaimed
thoughtfully
ah
she
kept
me
off
she
kept
me
off
her
charming
manner
is
in
itself
a
kind
of
contempt
it
an
abyss
it
the
wall
of
china
she
has
a
hard
polish
an
inimitable
surface
like
some
wonderful
porcelain
that
costs
more
than
you
think
do
you
want
to
become
like
that
sherringham
asked
if
i
could
i
should
be
enchanted
one
can
always
try
you
must
act
better
than
she
he
went
on
better
i
thought
you
wanted
me
to
give
it
up
ah
i
do
know
what
i
want
he
cried
and
you
torment
me
and
turn
me
inside
out
what
i
want
is
you
yourself
oh
do
worry
said
miriam
now
all
kindly
then
she
added
that
mademoiselle
voisin
had
invited
her
to
call
to
which
sherringham
replied
with
a
certain
dryness
that
she
would
probably
not
find
that
necessary
this
made
the
girl
stare
and
she
asked
do
you
mean
it
do
on
account
of
mamma
prejudices
say
this
time
on
account
of
mine
do
you
mean
because
she
has
lovers
her
lovers
are
none
of
our
business
none
of
mine
i
see
so
you
been
one
of
them
no
such
luck
what
a
pity
she
richly
wailed
i
should
have
liked
to
see
that
one
must
see
everything
to
be
able
to
do
everything
and
as
he
pressed
for
what
in
particular
she
had
wished
to
see
she
replied
the
way
a
woman
like
that
receives
one
of
the
old
ones
peter
gave
a
groan
at
this
which
was
at
the
same
time
partly
a
laugh
and
turning
away
to
drop
on
a
bench
ejaculated
you
do
do
he
sat
there
some
minutes
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
face
in
his
hands
his
friend
remained
looking
at
the
portrait
of
rachel
after
which
she
put
to
him
does
such
a
woman
as
that
receive
receive
every
one
every
one
who
goes
to
see
her
no
doubt
and
who
goes
lots
of
men
clever
men
eminent
men
ah
what
a
charming
life
then
does
she
go
out
not
what
we
philistines
mean
by
that
not
into
society
never
she
never
enters
a
lady
how
strange
when
one
as
distinguished
as
that
except
that
she
must
escape
a
lot
of
stupidities
and
then
where
does
she
learn
such
manners
she
teaches
manners
ses
she
does
need
to
learn
them
oh
she
has
given
me
ideas
but
in
london
actresses
go
into
society
miriam
continued
oh
into
ours
such
as
it
is
in
london
mêlons
les
and
sha
i
go
i
mean
if
i
want
you
have
every
facility
to
bore
yourself
do
doubt
it
and
does
she
feel
excluded
miriam
asked
excluded
from
what
she
has
the
fullest
life
the
fullest
an
intense
artistic
life
the
cleverest
men
in
paris
talk
over
her
work
with
her
the
principal
authors
of
plays
discuss
with
her
subjects
and
characters
and
questions
of
treatment
she
lives
in
the
world
of
art
ah
the
world
of
art
how
i
envy
her
and
you
offer
me
dashwood
sherringham
rose
in
his
emotion
i
you
miriam
burst
out
laughing
you
look
so
droll
you
offer
me
yourself
then
instead
of
all
these
things
my
dear
child
i
also
am
a
very
clever
man
he
said
trying
to
sink
his
consciousness
of
having
for
a
moment
stood
gaping
you
are
you
are
i
delight
in
you
no
ladies
at
all
no
comme
il
faut
she
began
again
ah
what
do
matter
your
business
is
the
artistic
life
he
broke
out
with
inconsequence
irritated
moreover
at
hearing
her
sound
that
trivial
note
again
you
a
dear
your
charming
good
sense
comes
back
to
you
what
do
you
want
of
me
then
i
want
you
for
myself
not
for
others
and
now
in
time
before
anything
done
why
then
did
you
bring
me
here
everything
done
i
feel
it
i
know
the
way
you
should
look
at
it
if
you
do
look
at
it
at
all
sherringham
conceded
that
so
easy
i
thought
you
liked
the
stage
so
miriam
artfully
added
do
you
want
me
to
be
a
great
swell
and
do
you
want
to
be
you
be
you
share
my
glory
so
will
you
share
mine
the
husband
of
an
actress
yes
i
see
myself
that
peter
cried
with
a
frank
ring
of
disgust
it
a
silly
position
no
doubt
but
if
you
too
good
for
it
why
talk
about
it
do
you
think
i
important
she
demanded
her
companion
met
her
eyes
and
she
suddenly
said
in
a
different
tone
ah
why
should
we
quarrel
when
you
been
so
kind
so
generous
ca
we
always
be
friends
the
truest
friends
her
voice
sank
to
the
sweetest
cadence
and
her
eyes
were
grateful
and
good
as
they
rested
on
him
she
sometimes
said
things
with
such
perfection
that
they
seemed
dishonest
but
in
this
case
he
was
stirred
to
an
expressive
response
just
as
he
was
making
it
however
he
was
moved
to
utter
other
words
take
care
here
dashwood
tried
attendant
was
in
the
doorway
he
had
come
back
to
say
that
they
really
must
relieve
him
book
fifth
xxii
dallow
came
up
to
london
soon
after
the
meeting
of
parliament
she
made
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
she
was
fond
of
town
and
that
in
present
conditions
it
would
of
course
not
have
become
less
attractive
to
her
but
she
prepared
to
retreat
again
for
the
easter
vacation
not
to
go
back
to
harsh
but
to
pay
a
couple
of
country
visits
she
did
not
however
depart
with
the
crowd
she
never
did
anything
with
the
crowd
but
waited
till
the
monday
after
parliament
rose
facing
with
composure
in
great
stanhope
street
the
horrors
as
she
had
been
taught
to
consider
them
of
a
sunday
out
of
the
session
she
had
done
what
she
could
to
mitigate
them
by
asking
a
handful
of
stray
men
to
dine
with
her
that
evening
several
members
of
this
disconsolate
class
sought
comfort
in
great
stanhope
street
in
the
afternoon
and
them
for
the
most
part
she
also
invited
to
return
at
eight
there
were
accordingly
almost
too
many
people
at
dinner
there
were
even
a
couple
of
wives
nick
dormer
was
then
present
though
he
had
not
been
in
the
afternoon
each
of
the
other
persons
had
said
on
coming
in
so
you
not
gone
i
awfully
glad
dallow
had
replied
no
i
not
gone
but
she
had
in
no
case
added
that
she
was
glad
nor
had
she
offered
an
explanation
she
never
offered
explanations
she
always
assumed
that
no
one
could
invent
them
so
well
as
those
who
had
the
florid
taste
to
desire
them
and
in
this
case
she
was
right
since
it
is
probable
that
few
of
her
visitors
failed
to
say
to
themselves
that
her
not
having
gone
would
have
had
something
to
do
with
dormer
that
could
pass
for
an
explanation
with
many
of
dallow
friends
who
as
a
general
thing
were
not
morbidly
analytic
especially
with
those
who
met
nick
as
a
matter
of
course
at
dinner
his
figuring
at
this
lady
entertainments
being
in
her
house
whenever
a
candle
was
lighted
was
taken
as
a
sign
that
there
was
something
rather
particular
between
them
nick
had
said
to
her
more
than
once
that
people
would
wonder
why
they
did
marry
but
he
was
wrong
in
this
inasmuch
as
there
were
many
of
their
friends
to
whom
it
have
occurred
that
his
position
could
be
improved
that
they
were
cousins
was
a
fact
not
so
evident
to
others
as
to
themselves
in
consequence
of
which
they
appeared
remarkably
intimate
the
person
seeing
clearest
in
the
matter
was
gresham
who
lived
so
much
in
the
world
that
being
left
now
and
then
to
one
own
company
had
become
her
idea
of
true
sociability
she
knew
very
well
that
if
she
had
been
privately
engaged
to
a
young
man
as
amiable
as
nick
dormer
she
would
have
managed
that
publicity
should
play
such
a
part
in
their
intercourse
and
she
had
her
secret
scorn
for
the
stupidity
of
people
whose
conception
of
nick
relation
to
julia
rested
on
the
fact
that
he
was
always
included
in
her
parties
if
he
never
was
there
they
might
talk
she
said
to
herself
but
gresham
was
supersubtle
to
her
it
would
have
appeared
natural
that
her
friend
should
celebrate
the
parliamentary
recess
by
going
down
to
harsh
and
securing
the
young
presence
there
for
a
fortnight
she
recognised
dallow
actual
plan
as
a
comparatively
poor
substitute
the
project
of
spending
the
holidays
in
other
people
houses
to
which
nick
had
also
promised
to
come
gresham
was
romantic
she
wondered
what
was
the
good
of
mere
snippets
and
snatches
the
chances
that
any
one
might
have
when
large
still
days
were
open
to
you
chances
of
which
half
the
sanctity
was
in
what
they
excluded
however
there
were
more
unsettled
matters
between
dallow
and
her
queer
kinsman
than
even
gresham
fine
insight
could
embrace
she
was
not
on
the
sunday
evening
before
easter
among
the
guests
in
great
stanhope
street
but
if
she
had
been
singular
indifference
to
observation
would
have
stopped
short
of
encouraging
her
to
remain
in
the
along
with
nick
after
the
others
had
gone
i
may
add
that
gresham
extreme
curiosity
would
have
emboldened
her
as
little
to
do
so
she
would
have
taken
for
granted
that
the
pair
wished
to
be
alone
together
though
she
would
have
regarded
this
only
as
a
snippet
the
company
had
at
all
events
stayed
late
and
it
was
nearly
twelve
when
the
last
of
them
standing
before
the
fire
in
the
room
they
had
quitted
broke
out
to
his
companion
see
here
julia
how
long
do
you
really
expect
me
to
endure
this
kind
of
thing
julia
made
him
no
answer
she
only
leaned
back
in
her
chair
with
her
eyes
upon
his
he
met
her
gaze
a
moment
then
he
turned
round
to
the
fire
and
for
another
moment
looked
into
it
after
this
he
faced
his
hostess
again
with
the
exclamation
it
so
foolish
it
so
damnably
foolish
she
still
said
nothing
but
at
the
end
of
a
minute
she
spoke
without
answering
him
i
shall
expect
you
on
tuesday
and
i
hope
you
come
by
a
decent
train
what
do
you
mean
by
a
decent
train
i
mean
i
hope
you
not
leave
it
till
the
last
thing
before
dinner
so
that
we
can
have
a
little
walk
or
something
what
a
little
walk
or
something
why
if
you
make
such
a
point
of
my
coming
to
griffin
do
you
want
me
to
come
at
all
she
hesitated
an
instant
then
she
returned
i
knew
you
hated
it
you
provoke
me
so
said
nick
you
try
to
i
think
and
severals
is
still
worse
you
get
out
of
that
if
you
can
dallow
went
on
if
i
can
what
to
prevent
me
you
promised
lady
whiteroy
but
of
course
that
nothing
i
do
care
a
straw
for
lady
whiteroy
and
you
promised
me
but
that
less
still
it
foolish
it
quite
idiotic
said
nick
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
eyes
on
the
ceiling
there
was
another
silence
at
the
end
of
which
julia
remarked
you
might
have
answered
macgeorge
when
he
spoke
to
you
macgeorge
what
has
he
to
do
with
it
he
has
to
do
with
your
getting
on
a
little
if
you
think
that
the
way
nick
broke
into
a
laugh
i
like
lessons
in
getting
on
in
other
words
i
suppose
you
mean
in
urbanity
from
you
julia
why
not
from
me
because
you
can
do
nothing
base
you
incapable
of
putting
on
a
flattering
manner
to
get
something
by
it
therefore
why
should
you
expect
me
to
you
unflattering
that
is
you
austere
in
proportion
as
there
may
be
something
to
be
got
she
sprang
from
her
chair
coming
toward
him
there
only
one
thing
i
want
in
the
world
you
know
very
well
yes
you
want
it
so
much
that
you
wo
even
take
it
when
it
pressed
on
you
how
long
do
you
seriously
expect
me
to
bear
it
nick
repeated
i
never
asked
you
to
do
anything
base
she
said
as
she
stood
in
front
of
him
if
i
not
clever
about
throwing
myself
into
things
it
all
the
more
reason
you
should
be
if
you
not
clever
my
dear
julia
nick
close
to
her
placed
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
shook
her
with
a
mixture
of
tenderness
and
passion
you
clever
enough
to
make
me
furious
sometimes
she
opened
and
closed
her
fan
looking
down
at
it
while
she
submitted
to
his
mild
violence
all
i
want
is
that
when
a
man
like
macgeorge
talks
to
you
you
should
appear
bored
to
death
you
used
to
be
so
charming
under
those
inflictions
now
you
appear
to
take
no
interest
in
anything
at
dinner
you
scarcely
opened
your
lips
you
treated
them
all
as
if
you
only
wished
they
go
i
did
wish
they
go
have
i
told
you
a
hundred
times
what
i
think
of
your
salon
how
then
do
you
want
me
to
live
she
asked
am
i
not
to
have
a
creature
in
the
house
as
many
creatures
as
you
like
your
freedom
complete
and
as
far
as
i
concerned
always
will
be
only
when
you
challenge
me
and
overhaul
me
not
justly
i
think
i
must
confess
the
simple
truth
that
there
are
many
of
your
friends
i
do
delight
in
oh
idea
of
pleasant
people
julia
lamented
i
should
like
once
for
all
to
know
what
it
really
is
i
can
tell
you
what
it
really
is
it
is
macgeorge
he
a
being
almost
grotesquely
limited
he
be
where
you
never
be
unless
you
change
to
be
where
macgeorge
is
not
would
be
very
much
my
desire
therefore
why
should
i
change
nick
demanded
however
i
had
the
least
intention
of
being
rude
to
him
and
i
do
think
i
was
he
went
on
to
the
best
of
my
ability
i
assume
a
virtue
if
i
have
it
but
apparently
i
not
enough
of
a
comedian
if
you
have
it
she
echoed
it
when
you
say
things
like
that
that
you
so
dreadfully
tiresome
as
if
there
were
anything
that
you
have
or
might
have
nick
turned
away
from
her
he
took
a
few
impatient
steps
in
the
room
looking
at
the
carpet
his
hands
always
in
his
pockets
then
he
came
back
to
the
fire
with
the
observation
it
rather
hard
to
be
found
so
wanting
when
one
has
tried
to
play
one
part
so
beautifully
he
paused
with
his
eyes
on
her
own
and
then
went
on
with
a
vibration
in
his
voice
i
imperilled
my
immortal
soul
or
at
least
bemuddled
my
intelligence
by
all
the
things
i
do
care
for
that
i
tried
to
do
and
all
the
things
i
detest
that
i
tried
to
be
and
all
the
things
i
never
can
be
that
i
tried
to
look
as
if
i
were
all
the
appearances
and
imitations
the
pretences
and
hypocrisies
in
which
i
steeped
myself
to
the
eyes
and
at
the
end
of
it
it
serves
me
right
my
reward
is
simply
to
learn
that
i
still
not
half
humbug
enough
julia
looked
away
from
him
as
soon
as
he
had
spoken
these
words
she
attached
her
eyes
to
the
clock
behind
him
and
observed
irrelevantly
i
very
sorry
but
i
think
you
had
better
go
i
do
like
you
to
stay
after
midnight
ah
what
you
like
and
what
you
do
like
and
where
one
begins
and
the
other
ends
all
that
an
impenetrable
mystery
the
young
man
declared
but
he
took
no
further
notice
of
her
allusion
to
his
departure
adding
in
a
different
tone
man
like
macgeorge
when
you
say
a
thing
of
that
sort
in
a
certain
particular
way
i
should
rather
like
to
suffer
you
to
perish
dallow
stared
it
might
have
seemed
for
an
instant
that
she
was
trying
to
look
stupid
how
can
i
help
it
if
a
few
years
hence
certain
to
be
at
the
head
of
any
liberal
government
we
ca
help
it
of
course
but
we
can
help
talking
about
it
nick
smiled
if
we
do
mention
it
it
may
be
noticed
you
trying
to
make
me
angry
you
in
one
of
your
vicious
moods
she
returned
blowing
out
on
the
a
guttering
candle
that
i
exasperated
i
already
had
the
honour
very
positively
to
inform
you
all
the
same
i
maintain
that
i
was
irreproachable
at
dinner
i
do
want
you
to
think
i
shall
always
be
as
good
as
that
you
looked
so
out
of
it
you
were
as
gloomy
as
if
every
earthly
hope
had
left
you
and
you
did
make
a
single
contribution
to
any
discussion
that
took
place
do
you
think
i
observe
you
she
asked
with
an
irony
tempered
by
a
tenderness
unsuccessfully
concealed
ah
my
darling
what
you
observe
nick
cried
with
a
certain
bitterness
of
amusement
but
he
added
the
next
moment
more
seriously
as
if
his
tone
had
been
disrespectful
you
probe
me
to
the
bottom
no
doubt
you
need
come
either
to
griffin
or
to
severals
if
you
do
want
to
give
them
up
yourself
stay
here
with
me
she
coloured
quickly
as
he
said
this
and
broke
out
lord
how
you
hate
political
houses
how
can
you
say
that
when
from
february
to
august
i
spend
every
blessed
night
in
one
yes
and
hate
that
worst
of
all
so
do
half
the
people
who
are
in
it
you
my
dear
must
have
so
many
things
so
many
people
so
much
and
such
a
perpetual
spectacle
to
live
nick
went
on
perpetual
motion
perpetual
visits
perpetual
crowds
if
you
go
into
the
country
you
see
forty
people
every
day
and
be
mixed
up
with
them
all
day
the
idea
of
a
quiet
fortnight
in
town
when
by
a
happy
if
idiotic
superstition
everybody
goes
out
of
it
disconcerts
and
frightens
you
it
the
very
time
the
very
place
to
do
a
little
work
and
possess
one
soul
this
vehement
allocution
found
her
evidently
somewhat
unprepared
but
she
was
sagacious
enough
instead
of
attempting
for
the
moment
a
general
rejoinder
to
seize
on
a
single
phrase
and
say
work
what
work
can
you
do
in
london
at
such
a
moment
as
this
nick
considered
i
might
tell
you
i
want
to
get
up
a
lot
of
subjects
to
sit
at
home
and
read
but
that
would
be
quite
what
i
mean
do
you
mean
you
want
to
paint
yes
that
it
since
you
gouge
it
out
of
me
why
do
you
make
such
a
mystery
about
it
you
at
perfect
liberty
julia
said
she
put
out
her
hand
to
rest
it
on
the
but
her
companion
took
it
on
the
way
and
held
it
in
both
his
own
you
delightful
julia
when
you
speak
in
that
tone
then
i
know
why
it
is
i
love
you
but
i
ca
do
anything
if
i
go
to
griffin
if
i
go
to
severals
i
see
i
see
she
answered
thoughtfully
and
kindly
i
scarcely
been
inside
of
my
studio
for
months
and
i
feel
quite
homesick
for
it
the
idea
of
putting
in
a
few
quiet
days
there
has
taken
hold
of
me
i
rather
cling
to
it
it
seems
so
odd
your
having
a
studio
julia
dropped
speaking
so
quickly
that
the
words
were
almost
incomprehensible
does
it
sound
absurd
for
all
the
good
it
does
me
or
i
do
it
of
course
one
can
produce
nothing
but
rubbish
on
such
terms
without
continuity
or
persistence
with
just
a
few
days
here
and
there
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
no
doubt
but
even
my
rubbish
interests
me
si
veut
ma
guenille
but
i
go
down
to
harsh
with
you
in
a
moment
julia
nick
pursued
that
would
do
as
well
if
we
could
be
quiet
there
without
people
without
a
creature
and
i
should
really
be
perfectly
content
you
beautifully
sit
for
me
it
would
be
the
occasion
we
so
often
wanted
and
never
found
she
shook
her
head
slowly
and
with
a
smile
that
had
a
meaning
for
him
thank
you
my
dear
nothing
would
induce
me
to
go
to
harsh
with
you
he
looked
at
her
hard
what
the
matter
whenever
it
a
question
of
anything
of
that
sort
are
you
afraid
of
me
she
pulled
her
hand
from
him
quickly
turning
away
but
he
went
on
stay
with
me
here
then
when
everything
so
right
for
it
we
shall
do
beautifully
have
the
whole
place
have
the
whole
day
to
ourselves
hang
your
engagements
telegraph
you
wo
come
we
live
at
the
studio
you
sit
to
me
every
day
now
or
never
our
chance
when
shall
we
have
so
good
a
one
think
how
charming
it
will
be
i
make
you
wish
awfully
that
i
may
do
something
i
ca
get
out
of
griffin
it
impossible
julia
said
moving
further
away
and
with
her
back
presented
to
him
then
you
afraid
of
me
simply
she
turned
straight
round
very
pale
of
course
i
am
you
welcome
to
know
it
he
went
toward
her
and
for
a
moment
she
seemed
to
make
another
slight
movement
of
retreat
this
however
was
scarcely
perceptible
and
there
was
nothing
to
alarm
in
the
tone
of
reasonable
entreaty
in
which
he
spoke
as
he
stood
there
put
an
end
julia
to
our
absurd
situation
it
really
ca
go
on
you
no
right
to
expect
a
man
to
be
happy
or
comfortable
in
so
false
a
position
we
spoken
of
odiously
of
that
we
may
be
sure
and
yet
what
good
have
we
of
it
spoken
of
do
i
care
for
that
do
you
mean
you
indifferent
because
there
are
no
grounds
just
why
i
hate
it
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
she
returned
with
sharp
disdain
be
my
wife
be
my
wife
next
week
let
us
have
done
with
this
fantastic
probation
and
be
happy
leave
me
now
come
back
i
write
to
you
she
had
the
air
of
pleading
with
him
at
present
pleading
as
he
pleaded
you
ca
resign
yourself
to
the
idea
of
one
looking
of
it
nick
laughed
come
before
lunch
she
went
on
to
be
told
i
must
wait
six
months
more
and
then
be
sent
about
my
business
ah
julia
julia
the
young
man
groaned
something
in
this
simple
lament
it
sounded
natural
and
perfectly
unstudied
seemed
straightway
to
make
a
great
impression
on
her
you
shall
wait
no
longer
she
said
after
a
short
silence
what
do
you
mean
by
no
longer
give
me
about
five
weeks
say
till
the
whitsuntide
recess
five
weeks
are
a
great
deal
smiled
nick
there
are
things
to
be
done
you
ought
to
understand
i
only
understand
how
i
love
you
she
let
herself
go
dearest
nick
and
he
caught
her
and
kept
her
in
his
arms
i
your
promise
then
for
five
weeks
hence
to
a
day
he
demanded
as
she
at
last
released
herself
we
settle
that
the
exact
day
there
are
things
to
consider
and
to
arrange
come
to
luncheon
i
come
early
i
come
at
one
he
said
and
for
a
moment
they
stood
all
deeply
and
intimately
taking
each
other
in
do
you
think
i
to
wait
any
more
than
you
she
asked
in
congruity
with
this
i
do
feel
so
much
out
of
it
now
he
declared
by
way
of
answer
you
stay
of
course
now
you
give
up
your
visits
she
had
hold
of
the
lappet
of
his
coat
she
had
kept
it
in
her
hand
even
while
she
detached
herself
from
his
embrace
there
was
a
white
flower
in
his
buttonhole
that
she
looked
at
and
played
with
a
moment
before
she
said
i
a
better
idea
you
need
come
to
griffin
stay
in
your
studio
do
as
you
like
paint
dozens
of
pictures
dozens
barbarian
nick
wailed
the
epithet
apparently
had
an
endearing
suggestion
for
her
it
at
any
rate
led
her
to
let
him
possess
himself
of
her
head
and
so
holding
it
kiss
her
led
her
to
say
what
on
earth
do
i
want
but
that
you
should
do
absolutely
as
you
please
and
be
as
happy
as
you
can
he
kissed
her
in
another
place
at
this
but
he
put
it
to
her
what
dreadful
proposition
is
coming
now
i
go
off
and
do
up
my
visits
and
come
back
and
leave
me
alone
do
be
affected
you
know
you
work
much
better
without
me
live
in
your
studio
i
shall
be
well
out
of
the
way
that
not
what
one
wants
of
a
sitter
how
can
i
paint
you
you
can
paint
me
all
the
rest
of
your
life
i
shall
be
a
perpetual
sitter
i
believe
i
could
paint
you
without
looking
at
you
and
his
lighted
face
shone
down
on
her
you
do
excuse
me
then
from
those
dreary
places
how
can
i
insist
after
what
you
said
about
the
pleasure
of
keeping
these
days
she
admirably
it
was
so
all
sincerely
asked
you
the
best
woman
on
earth
though
it
does
seem
odd
you
should
rush
away
as
soon
as
our
little
business
is
settled
we
shall
make
it
up
i
know
what
i
about
and
now
go
she
ended
by
almost
pushing
him
out
of
the
room
xxiii
it
was
certainly
singular
in
the
light
of
other
matters
that
on
sitting
down
in
his
studio
after
she
had
left
town
nick
should
not
as
regards
the
effort
to
project
plastically
some
beautiful
form
have
felt
more
chilled
by
the
absence
of
a
friend
who
was
such
an
embodiment
of
beauty
she
was
away
and
he
missed
her
and
longed
for
her
and
yet
without
her
the
place
was
more
filled
with
what
he
wanted
to
find
in
it
he
turned
into
it
with
confused
feelings
the
strongest
of
which
was
a
sense
of
release
and
recreation
it
looked
blighted
and
lonely
and
dusty
and
his
old
studies
as
he
rummaged
them
out
struck
him
even
as
less
inspired
than
the
last
time
he
had
ventured
to
face
them
but
amid
this
neglected
litter
in
the
colourless
and
obstructed
light
of
a
high
north
window
which
needed
washing
he
came
nearer
tasting
the
possibility
of
positive
happiness
it
appeared
to
him
that
as
he
had
said
to
julia
he
was
more
in
possession
of
his
soul
it
was
frivolity
and
folly
it
was
puerility
to
spend
valuable
hours
pottering
over
the
vain
implements
of
an
art
he
had
relinquished
and
a
certain
shame
that
he
had
felt
in
presenting
his
plea
to
julia
that
sunday
night
arose
from
the
sense
not
of
what
he
clung
to
but
of
what
he
had
given
up
he
had
turned
his
back
on
serious
work
so
that
pottering
was
now
all
he
could
aspire
to
it
could
be
fruitful
it
could
be
anything
but
ridiculous
almost
ignoble
but
it
soothed
his
nerves
it
was
in
the
nature
of
a
secret
dissipation
he
had
never
suspected
he
should
some
day
have
nerves
on
his
own
part
to
count
with
but
this
possibility
had
been
revealed
to
him
on
the
day
it
became
clear
that
he
was
letting
something
precious
go
he
was
glad
he
had
not
to
justify
himself
to
the
critical
for
this
might
have
been
a
delicate
business
the
critical
were
mostly
absent
and
besides
shut
up
all
day
in
his
studio
how
should
he
ever
meet
them
it
was
the
place
in
the
world
where
he
felt
furthest
away
from
his
constituents
that
was
a
part
of
the
pleasure
the
consciousness
that
for
the
hour
the
coast
was
clear
and
his
mind
independent
his
mother
and
his
sister
had
gone
to
broadwood
lady
agnes
the
phrase
sounds
brutal
but
represents
his
state
of
mind
was
well
out
of
the
way
he
had
written
to
her
as
soon
as
julia
left
town
he
had
apprised
her
of
the
fact
that
his
was
fixed
a
relief
for
poor
lady
agnes
to
a
period
of
intolerable
mystification
of
dark
dumb
wondering
and
watching
she
had
said
her
say
the
day
of
the
poll
at
harsh
she
was
too
proud
to
ask
and
too
discreet
to
nag
so
she
could
only
wait
for
something
that
come
the
unconditioned
loan
of
broadwood
had
of
course
been
something
of
a
bribe
to
patience
she
had
at
first
felt
that
on
the
day
she
should
take
possession
of
that
capital
house
julia
would
indeed
seem
to
have
entered
the
family
but
the
gift
had
confirmed
expectations
just
enough
to
make
disappointment
more
bitter
and
the
discomfort
was
greater
in
proportion
as
she
failed
to
discover
what
was
the
matter
her
daughter
grace
was
much
occupied
with
this
question
and
brought
it
up
for
discussion
in
a
manner
irritating
to
her
ladyship
who
had
a
high
theory
of
being
silent
about
it
but
who
however
in
the
long
run
was
more
unhappy
when
in
consequence
of
a
reprimand
the
girl
suggested
no
reasons
at
all
than
when
she
suggested
stupid
ones
it
eased
lady
agnes
a
little
to
advert
to
the
mystery
when
she
could
have
the
air
of
not
having
begun
the
letter
nick
received
from
her
the
first
day
of
passion
week
in
reply
to
his
important
communication
was
the
only
one
he
read
at
that
moment
not
counting
of
course
the
several
notes
dallow
addressed
to
him
from
griffin
there
were
letters
piled
up
as
he
knew
in
calcutta
gardens
which
his
servant
had
strict
orders
not
to
bring
to
the
studio
nick
slept
now
in
the
bedroom
attached
to
this
retreat
got
things
as
he
wanted
them
from
calcutta
gardens
and
dined
at
his
club
where
a
stray
surviving
friend
or
two
seeing
him
prowl
about
the
library
in
the
evening
was
free
to
impute
to
such
eccentricity
some
subtly
political
basis
when
he
thought
of
his
neglected
letters
he
remembered
carteret
convictions
on
the
subject
of
not
getting
behind
they
made
him
laugh
in
the
slightly
sonorous
as
he
bent
over
one
of
the
old
canvases
that
he
had
ventured
to
turn
to
the
light
he
was
fully
determined
however
to
master
his
correspondence
before
going
down
the
last
thing
before
parliament
should
reassemble
to
spend
another
day
at
beauclere
mastering
his
correspondence
meant
in
mind
breaking
open
envelopes
writing
answers
was
scarcely
involved
in
the
idea
but
carteret
would
never
guess
that
nick
was
not
moved
even
to
write
to
him
that
the
affair
with
julia
was
on
the
point
of
taking
the
form
he
had
been
so
good
as
to
desire
he
reserved
the
pleasure
of
this
announcement
for
a
personal
interview
the
day
before
good
friday
in
the
morning
his
stillness
was
broken
by
a
on
the
outer
door
of
his
studio
administered
apparently
by
the
knob
of
a
his
servant
was
out
and
he
went
to
the
door
wondering
who
his
visitor
could
be
at
such
a
time
especially
of
the
rather
presuming
class
the
class
was
indicated
by
the
failure
to
look
for
the
bell
since
there
a
bell
though
it
required
a
little
research
in
a
moment
the
mystery
was
solved
the
gentleman
who
stood
smiling
at
him
from
the
threshold
could
only
be
gabriel
nash
nick
had
not
seen
this
whimsical
personage
for
several
months
and
had
had
no
news
of
him
beyond
a
general
intimation
that
he
was
following
his
fancy
in
foreign
parts
his
old
friend
had
sufficiently
prepared
him
at
the
time
of
their
reunion
in
paris
for
the
idea
of
the
fitful
in
intercourse
and
he
had
not
been
ignorant
on
his
return
from
paris
that
he
should
have
had
an
opportunity
to
miss
him
if
he
had
not
been
too
busy
to
take
advantage
of
it
in
london
after
the
episode
at
harsh
gabriel
had
not
reappeared
he
had
redeemed
none
of
the
pledges
given
the
night
they
walked
together
to
notre
dame
and
conversed
on
important
matters
he
was
to
have
interposed
in
destiny
but
he
had
not
interposed
he
was
to
have
pulled
him
hard
and
in
the
opposite
sense
from
julia
but
there
had
been
no
pulling
he
was
to
have
saved
him
as
he
called
it
and
yet
nick
was
lost
this
circumstance
indeed
formed
his
excuse
the
member
for
harsh
had
rushed
so
wantonly
to
perdition
nick
had
for
the
hour
seriously
wished
to
keep
hold
of
him
he
valued
him
as
a
salutary
influence
yet
on
coming
to
his
senses
after
his
election
our
young
man
had
recognised
that
nash
might
very
well
have
reflected
on
the
thanklessness
of
such
a
slippery
subject
might
have
held
himself
released
from
his
vows
of
course
it
had
been
particularly
in
the
event
of
a
liberal
triumph
that
he
had
threatened
to
make
himself
felt
the
effect
of
a
brand
plucked
from
the
burning
would
be
so
much
greater
if
the
flames
were
already
high
yet
nick
had
not
kept
him
to
the
letter
of
this
pledge
and
had
so
fully
admitted
the
right
of
a
thorough
connoisseur
let
alone
a
faithful
friend
to
lose
patience
with
him
that
he
was
now
far
from
greeting
his
visitor
with
a
reproach
he
felt
much
more
thrown
on
his
defence
gabriel
however
forbore
at
first
to
attack
him
he
brought
in
only
blandness
and
benevolence
and
a
great
content
at
having
obeyed
the
mystic
voice
it
was
really
a
remarkable
case
of
second
sight
which
had
whispered
him
that
the
recreant
comrade
of
his
prime
was
in
town
he
had
just
come
back
from
sicily
after
a
southern
winter
according
to
a
custom
frequent
with
him
and
had
been
moved
by
a
miraculous
prescience
unfavourable
as
the
moment
might
seem
to
go
and
ask
for
nick
in
calcutta
gardens
where
he
had
extracted
from
his
friend
servant
an
address
not
known
to
all
the
world
he
showed
nick
what
a
mistake
it
had
been
to
fear
a
dull
arraignment
and
how
he
habitually
ignored
all
lapses
and
kept
up
the
standard
only
by
taking
a
hundred
fine
things
for
granted
he
also
abounded
more
than
ever
in
his
own
sense
reminding
his
relieved
listener
how
no
recollection
of
him
no
evocation
of
him
in
absence
could
ever
do
him
justice
you
could
recall
him
without
seeming
to
exaggerate
him
and
then
acknowledged
when
you
saw
him
that
your
exaggeration
had
fallen
short
he
emerged
out
of
vagueness
his
sicily
might
have
been
the
sicily
of
winter
and
would
evidently
be
reabsorbed
in
it
but
his
presence
was
positive
and
pervasive
enough
he
was
duly
intense
while
he
lasted
his
connexions
were
with
beauty
urbanity
and
conversation
as
usual
but
they
made
up
a
circle
you
could
find
in
the
court
guide
nick
had
a
sense
that
he
knew
a
lot
of
esthetic
people
but
he
dealt
in
ideas
much
more
than
in
names
and
addresses
he
was
genial
and
jocose
sunburnt
and
romantically
allusive
it
was
to
be
gathered
that
he
had
been
living
for
many
days
in
a
saracenic
tower
where
his
principal
occupation
was
to
watch
for
the
flushing
of
the
west
he
had
retained
all
the
serenity
of
his
opinions
and
made
light
with
a
candour
of
which
the
only
defect
was
apparently
that
it
was
not
quite
enough
a
conscious
virtue
of
many
of
the
objects
of
common
esteem
when
nick
asked
him
what
he
had
been
doing
he
replied
oh
living
you
know
and
the
tone
of
the
words
offered
them
as
the
story
of
a
great
deed
he
made
a
long
visit
staying
to
luncheon
and
after
luncheon
so
that
the
little
studio
heard
all
at
once
a
greater
quantity
of
brave
talk
than
in
the
several
previous
years
of
its
history
with
much
of
our
tale
left
to
tell
it
is
a
pity
that
so
little
of
this
colloquy
may
be
reported
here
since
as
affairs
took
their
course
it
marked
really
if
the
question
be
of
noting
the
exact
point
a
turn
of
the
tide
in
nick
dormer
personal
situation
he
was
destined
to
remember
the
accent
with
which
nash
exclaimed
on
his
drawing
forth
sundry
specimens
of
amateurish
earnestness
i
say
i
say
i
say
he
glanced
round
with
a
heightened
colour
they
pretty
bad
eh
oh
you
a
deep
one
nash
went
on
what
the
matter
do
you
call
your
conduct
that
of
a
man
of
honour
scarcely
perhaps
but
when
no
one
has
seen
them
that
your
villainy
de
du
pur
come
my
dear
fellow
this
is
very
serious
it
a
bad
business
said
gabriel
nash
then
he
added
almost
with
austerity
you
be
so
good
as
to
place
before
me
every
patch
of
paint
every
sketch
and
scrap
that
this
room
contains
nick
complied
in
great
good
humour
he
turned
out
his
boxes
and
drawers
shovelled
forth
the
contents
of
bulging
portfolios
mounted
on
chairs
to
unhook
old
canvases
that
had
been
severely
skied
he
was
modest
and
docile
and
patient
and
amused
above
all
he
was
quite
thrilled
thrilled
with
the
idea
of
eliciting
a
note
of
appreciation
so
late
in
the
day
it
was
the
oddest
thing
how
he
at
present
in
fact
found
himself
imputing
value
to
his
visitor
attributing
to
him
among
attributions
more
confused
the
dignity
of
judgement
the
authority
of
knowledge
nash
was
an
ambiguous
character
but
an
excellent
touchstone
the
two
said
very
little
for
a
while
and
they
had
almost
half
an
hour
silence
during
which
after
our
young
man
had
hastily
improvised
an
exhibition
there
was
only
a
puffing
of
cigarettes
gabriel
walked
about
looking
at
this
and
that
taking
up
rough
studies
and
laying
them
down
asking
a
question
of
fact
fishing
with
his
umbrella
on
the
floor
amid
a
pile
of
unarranged
sketches
nick
accepted
jocosely
the
attitude
of
suspense
but
there
was
even
more
of
it
in
his
heart
than
in
his
face
so
few
people
had
seen
his
young
work
almost
no
one
who
really
counted
he
had
been
ashamed
of
it
never
showing
it
to
bring
on
a
conclusion
since
a
conclusion
was
precisely
what
he
feared
he
whistled
now
while
he
let
his
companion
take
time
he
rubbed
old
panels
with
his
sleeve
and
dabbed
wet
sponges
on
surfaces
that
had
sunk
it
was
a
long
time
since
he
had
felt
so
gay
strange
as
such
an
assertion
sounds
in
regard
to
a
young
man
whose
had
at
his
urgent
solicitation
lately
been
fixed
he
had
stayed
in
town
to
be
alone
with
his
imagination
and
suddenly
paradoxically
the
sense
of
that
result
had
arrived
with
poor
nash
nicholas
dormer
this
personage
remarked
at
last
for
grossness
of
immorality
i
think
i
never
seen
your
equal
that
sounds
so
well
nick
returned
that
i
hesitate
to
risk
spoiling
it
by
wishing
it
explained
do
you
recognise
in
degree
the
grand
idea
of
duty
if
i
do
grasp
it
with
a
certain
firmness
i
a
deadly
failure
for
i
was
quite
brought
up
on
it
nick
said
then
you
indeed
the
wretchedest
failure
i
know
life
is
ugly
after
all
do
i
gather
that
you
yourself
recognise
obligations
of
the
order
you
allude
to
do
you
nash
stared
why
are
they
the
very
flame
of
my
faith
the
burden
of
my
song
my
dear
fellow
duty
is
doing
and
i
inferred
that
you
think
rather
poorly
of
doing
that
it
spoils
one
style
doing
wrong
assuredly
but
what
do
you
call
right
what
your
canon
of
certainty
there
nick
asked
the
conscience
that
in
us
that
charming
conversible
infinite
thing
the
intensest
thing
we
know
but
you
must
treat
the
oracle
civilly
if
you
wish
to
make
it
speak
you
must
stride
into
the
temple
in
muddy
and
with
your
hat
on
your
head
as
the
puritan
troopers
tramped
into
the
dear
old
abbeys
one
must
do
one
best
to
find
out
the
right
and
your
criminality
appears
to
be
that
you
not
taken
the
commonest
trouble
i
had
you
to
ask
smiled
nick
but
duty
strikes
me
as
doing
something
in
particular
if
you
too
afraid
it
may
be
the
wrong
thing
you
may
let
everything
go
being
is
doing
and
if
doing
is
duty
being
is
duty
do
you
follow
at
a
very
great
distance
to
be
what
one
be
really
and
efficaciously
nash
went
on
to
feel
it
and
understand
it
to
accept
it
adopt
it
embrace
it
conduct
that
life
and
suppose
one
a
brute
or
an
ass
where
the
efficacy
in
one
very
want
of
intelligence
in
such
cases
one
out
of
it
the
question
does
exist
one
simply
becomes
a
part
of
the
duty
of
others
the
brute
the
ass
nick
visitor
developed
neither
feels
nor
understands
nor
accepts
nor
adopts
those
fine
processes
in
themselves
classify
us
they
educate
they
exalt
they
preserve
so
that
to
profit
by
them
we
must
be
as
perceptive
as
we
can
we
must
recognise
our
particular
form
the
instrument
that
each
of
us
each
of
us
who
carries
anything
carries
in
his
being
mastering
this
instrument
learning
to
play
it
in
perfection
that
what
i
call
duty
what
i
call
conduct
what
i
call
success
nick
listened
with
friendly
attention
and
the
air
of
general
assent
was
in
his
face
as
he
said
every
one
has
it
then
this
individual
pipe
one
my
dear
fellow
is
too
much
to
say
for
the
world
full
of
the
crudest
the
book
of
life
padded
ah
but
padded
a
deplorable
want
of
editing
i
speak
of
every
one
who
any
one
of
course
there
are
pipes
and
pipes
little
quavering
flutes
for
the
concerted
movements
and
big
for
the
great
solos
i
see
i
see
and
what
might
your
instrument
be
nash
hesitated
not
a
moment
his
answer
was
radiantly
there
to
speak
to
people
just
as
i
speaking
to
you
to
prevent
for
instance
a
great
wrong
being
done
a
great
wrong
yes
to
the
human
race
i
talk
i
talk
i
say
the
things
other
people
do
the
things
they
ca
the
things
they
wo
gabriel
went
on
with
his
inimitable
candour
if
it
a
question
of
mastery
and
perfection
you
certainly
have
them
his
companion
replied
and
you
have
alas
that
the
pity
of
it
that
the
scandal
that
the
wrong
i
want
to
set
right
before
it
becomes
too
public
a
shame
if
i
called
you
just
now
grossly
immoral
it
on
account
of
the
spectacle
you
present
a
spectacle
to
be
hidden
from
the
eye
of
ingenuous
youth
that
of
a
man
neglecting
his
own
fiddle
to
blunder
away
on
that
of
one
of
his
fellows
we
ca
afford
such
mistakes
we
tolerate
such
licence
you
think
then
i
a
fiddle
and
our
young
man
in
spite
of
himself
attached
to
the
question
a
quaver
of
suspense
finer
doubtless
than
any
that
had
ever
passed
his
lips
a
regular
stradivarius
all
these
things
you
shown
me
are
remarkably
interesting
you
a
talent
of
a
wonderfully
pure
strain
i
say
i
say
i
say
nick
exclaimed
hovering
there
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
a
blush
on
his
lighted
face
while
he
repeated
with
a
change
of
accent
nash
exclamation
of
half
an
hour
before
i
like
it
your
talent
i
measure
it
i
appreciate
it
i
insist
upon
it
that
critic
went
on
between
the
whiffs
of
his
cigarette
i
have
to
be
awfully
wise
and
good
to
do
so
but
fortunately
i
am
in
such
a
case
that
my
duty
i
shall
make
you
my
business
for
a
while
therefore
he
added
piously
do
say
i
unconscious
of
the
moral
law
a
stradivarius
said
nick
interrogatively
and
with
his
eyes
wide
open
the
thought
in
his
mind
was
of
how
different
this
seemed
from
his
having
gone
to
griffin
xxiv
his
counsellor
had
plenty
of
further
opportunity
to
develop
this
and
other
figurative
remarks
for
he
not
only
spent
several
of
the
middle
hours
of
the
day
at
the
studio
but
came
back
in
the
evening
the
pair
had
dined
together
at
a
little
foreign
pothouse
in
soho
revealed
to
nick
on
this
occasion
and
discussed
the
great
question
far
into
the
night
the
great
question
was
whether
on
the
showing
of
those
examples
of
his
ability
with
which
the
scene
of
their
discourse
was
now
densely
bestrewn
nick
dormer
would
be
justified
in
really
going
in
for
the
practice
of
pictorial
art
this
may
strike
many
readers
of
his
history
as
a
limited
and
even
trivial
inquiry
with
little
of
the
heroic
or
the
romantic
in
it
but
it
was
none
the
less
carried
to
the
finest
point
by
our
impassioned
young
men
nick
suspected
nash
of
exaggerating
his
encouragement
in
order
to
play
a
malign
trick
on
the
political
world
at
whose
expense
it
was
his
fond
fancy
to
divert
himself
without
indeed
making
that
organisation
perceptibly
totter
and
reminded
him
that
his
present
accusation
of
immorality
was
strangely
inconsistent
with
the
wanton
hope
expressed
by
him
in
paris
the
hope
that
the
liberal
candidate
at
harsh
would
be
returned
nash
replied
first
oh
i
been
in
this
place
then
but
he
defended
himself
later
and
more
effectually
by
saying
that
it
was
not
of
nick
having
got
elected
he
complained
it
was
of
his
visible
hesitancy
to
throw
up
his
seat
nick
begged
that
he
would
mention
this
and
his
gallantry
failed
to
render
him
incapable
of
saying
the
fact
is
i
have
the
nerve
for
it
they
talked
then
for
a
while
of
what
he
do
not
of
what
he
could
of
the
mysteries
and
miracles
of
reproduction
and
representation
of
the
strong
sane
joys
of
the
artistic
life
nick
made
afresh
with
more
fulness
his
great
confession
that
his
private
ideal
of
happiness
was
the
life
of
a
great
painter
of
portraits
he
uttered
his
thought
on
that
head
so
copiously
and
lucidly
that
nash
own
abundance
was
stilled
and
he
listened
almost
as
if
he
had
been
listening
to
something
new
difficult
as
it
was
to
conceive
a
point
of
view
for
such
a
matter
with
which
he
was
unacquainted
there
it
is
said
nick
at
last
there
the
naked
preposterous
truth
that
if
i
were
to
do
exactly
as
i
liked
i
should
spend
my
years
reproducing
the
more
or
less
vacuous
countenances
of
my
i
should
find
peace
and
pleasure
and
wisdom
and
worth
i
should
find
fascination
and
a
measure
of
success
in
it
out
of
the
din
and
the
dust
and
the
scramble
the
world
of
party
labels
party
cries
party
bargains
and
party
treacheries
of
humbuggery
hypocrisy
and
cant
the
cleanness
and
quietness
of
it
the
independent
effort
to
do
something
to
leave
something
which
shall
give
joy
to
man
long
after
the
howling
has
died
away
to
the
last
ghost
of
an
echo
such
a
vision
solicits
me
in
the
watches
of
night
with
an
almost
irresistible
force
as
he
dropped
these
remarks
he
lolled
on
a
big
divan
with
one
of
his
long
legs
folded
up
while
his
visitor
stopped
in
front
of
him
after
moving
about
the
room
vaguely
and
softly
almost
on
tiptoe
so
as
not
to
interrupt
him
you
speak
nash
said
with
the
special
and
dreadful
eloquence
that
rises
to
a
man
lips
when
he
has
practically
whatever
his
theory
may
be
renounced
the
right
and
dropped
hideously
into
the
wrong
then
his
regret
for
the
right
a
certain
exquisite
appreciation
of
it
puts
on
an
accent
i
know
well
how
to
recognise
nick
looked
up
at
him
a
moment
you
hit
it
if
you
mean
by
that
that
i
have
resigned
my
seat
and
that
i
do
intend
to
i
thought
you
took
it
only
to
give
it
up
do
you
remember
our
talk
in
paris
i
like
to
be
a
part
of
the
spectacle
that
amuses
you
nick
returned
but
i
could
scarcely
have
taken
so
much
trouble
as
that
for
it
is
it
then
an
absurd
comedy
the
life
you
lead
comedy
or
tragedy
i
do
know
which
whatever
it
is
i
appear
to
be
capable
of
it
to
please
two
or
three
people
then
you
take
trouble
said
nash
yes
for
the
woman
i
to
marry
oh
you
to
marry
that
what
has
come
on
since
we
met
in
paris
nick
explained
and
it
makes
just
the
difference
ah
my
poor
friend
smiled
gabriel
much
arrested
no
wonder
you
an
eloquence
an
accent
it
a
pity
i
have
them
in
the
wrong
place
i
expected
to
have
them
in
the
house
of
commons
you
will
when
you
make
your
farewell
speech
there
to
announce
that
you
chuck
it
up
and
may
i
venture
to
ask
who
to
be
your
wife
the
visitor
pursued
dallow
has
kindly
consented
to
accept
that
yoke
i
think
you
saw
her
in
paris
ah
yes
you
spoke
of
her
to
me
and
i
remember
asking
you
even
then
if
you
were
in
love
with
her
i
was
then
said
nick
nash
had
a
grave
pause
and
are
you
now
oh
dear
yes
that
would
be
better
if
it
was
worse
nothing
could
be
better
nick
declared
it
the
best
thing
that
can
happen
to
me
well
his
friend
continued
you
must
let
me
very
respectfully
approach
this
lady
you
must
let
me
bring
her
round
bring
her
round
to
what
to
everything
talk
her
over
talk
her
under
nick
laughed
but
making
his
joke
a
little
as
to
gain
time
he
remembered
the
effect
this
adviser
had
produced
on
julia
an
effect
that
scantly
ministered
to
the
idea
of
another
meeting
julia
had
had
no
occasion
to
allude
again
to
nick
imperturbable
friend
he
had
passed
out
of
her
life
at
once
and
for
ever
but
there
flickered
up
a
quick
memory
of
the
contempt
he
had
led
her
to
express
together
with
a
sense
of
how
odd
she
would
think
it
her
intended
should
have
thrown
over
two
pleasant
visits
to
cultivate
such
company
over
to
a
proper
pride
in
what
you
may
do
nash
returned
what
you
may
do
above
all
if
she
help
you
i
scarcely
see
how
she
can
help
me
said
nick
with
an
air
of
thinking
she
extremely
handsome
as
i
remember
her
you
could
do
great
things
with
ah
there
the
rub
nick
went
on
i
wanted
her
to
sit
for
me
this
week
but
she
would
hear
of
it
a
bien
you
should
attack
some
fine
strong
type
is
dallow
in
london
nash
inquired
for
what
do
you
take
her
she
paying
visits
then
i
a
model
for
you
then
have
nick
stared
what
has
that
to
do
with
dallow
being
away
does
it
give
you
more
time
oh
the
time
flies
sighed
nick
with
a
spontaneity
that
made
his
companion
again
laugh
out
a
demonstration
in
which
for
a
moment
he
himself
rather
ruefully
joined
does
she
like
you
to
paint
that
personage
asked
with
one
of
his
candid
intonations
so
she
says
well
do
something
fine
to
show
her
i
rather
show
it
to
you
nick
confessed
my
dear
fellow
i
see
it
from
here
if
you
do
your
duty
do
you
remember
the
tragic
muse
nash
added
for
explanation
the
tragic
muse
that
girl
in
paris
whom
we
heard
at
the
old
actress
and
afterwards
met
at
the
charming
entertainment
given
by
your
cousin
is
he
the
secretary
of
embassy
oh
peter
girl
of
course
i
remember
her
do
call
her
peter
call
her
rather
mine
nash
said
with
easy
rectification
i
invented
her
i
introduced
her
i
revealed
her
i
thought
you
on
the
contrary
ridiculed
and
repudiated
her
as
a
fine
handsome
young
woman
surely
not
i
seem
to
myself
to
have
been
all
the
while
rendering
her
services
i
said
i
disliked
ranters
and
so
i
do
but
if
my
estimate
of
her
powers
was
below
the
mark
she
has
more
than
punished
me
what
has
she
done
nick
asked
she
has
become
interesting
as
i
suppose
you
know
how
should
i
know
well
you
must
see
her
you
must
paint
her
nash
returned
she
tells
me
something
was
said
about
it
that
day
at
madame
carré
oh
i
remember
said
by
peter
then
it
will
please
sherringham
you
be
glad
to
do
that
i
suppose
you
know
all
he
has
done
for
miriam
gabriel
pursued
not
a
bit
i
know
nothing
about
peter
affairs
nick
said
unless
it
be
in
general
that
he
goes
in
for
mountebanks
and
mimes
and
that
it
occurs
to
me
i
heard
one
of
my
sisters
mention
the
rumour
had
come
to
her
that
he
has
been
backing
miss
rooth
miss
rooth
delights
to
talk
of
his
kindness
she
charming
when
she
speaks
of
it
it
to
his
good
offices
that
she
owes
her
appearance
here
here
nick
interest
rose
is
she
in
london
i
thought
you
people
read
the
papers
what
should
i
read
when
i
sit
sometimes
through
the
stuff
they
put
into
them
of
course
i
see
that
that
your
engagement
at
your
own
with
its
interminable
keeps
you
from
going
to
the
others
learn
then
said
gabriel
nash
that
you
a
great
competitor
and
that
you
distinctly
not
much
as
you
may
suppose
it
rising
comedian
the
tragic
muse
is
the
great
modern
personage
have
you
heard
people
speak
of
her
have
you
been
taken
to
see
her
nick
bethought
himself
i
daresay
i
heard
of
her
but
with
a
good
many
other
things
on
my
mind
i
had
forgotten
it
certainly
i
can
imagine
what
has
been
on
your
mind
she
remembers
you
at
any
rate
she
repays
neglect
with
sympathy
she
wants
said
nash
to
come
and
see
you
me
it
was
all
for
nick
now
a
wonder
to
be
seen
by
you
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
she
really
worth
seeing
you
must
let
me
bring
her
you
find
her
very
suggestive
that
idea
that
you
should
paint
her
she
appears
to
consider
it
a
sort
of
bargain
a
bargain
our
young
man
entered
as
he
believed
into
the
humour
of
the
thing
what
will
she
give
me
a
splendid
model
she
splendid
oh
then
bring
her
said
nick
xxv
nash
brought
her
the
great
modern
personage
as
he
had
described
her
the
very
next
day
and
it
took
his
friend
no
long
time
to
test
his
assurance
that
miriam
rooth
was
now
splendid
she
had
made
an
impression
on
him
ten
months
before
but
it
had
haunted
him
only
a
day
soon
overlaid
as
it
had
been
with
other
images
yet
after
nash
had
talked
of
her
a
while
he
recalled
her
better
some
of
her
attitudes
some
of
her
looks
and
tones
began
to
hover
before
him
he
was
charmed
in
advance
with
the
notion
of
painting
her
when
she
stood
there
in
fact
however
it
seemed
to
him
he
had
remembered
her
wrong
the
brave
free
rather
grand
creature
who
instantly
filled
his
studio
with
such
an
unexampled
presence
had
so
shaken
off
her
clumsiness
the
rudeness
and
crudeness
that
had
made
him
pity
her
a
whole
provincial
and
side
miss
rooth
was
light
and
bright
and
direct
direct
without
being
stiff
and
bright
without
being
garish
to
nick
perhaps
inadequately
sophisticated
mind
the
model
the
actress
were
figures
of
a
vulgar
setting
but
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
show
that
taint
less
than
this
extremely
natural
yet
extremely
distinguished
aspirant
to
distinction
she
was
more
natural
even
than
gabriel
nash
nature
was
still
nick
formula
for
his
amusing
old
friend
and
beside
her
he
appeared
almost
commonplace
nash
recognised
her
superiority
with
a
frankness
honourable
to
both
of
them
testifying
in
this
manner
to
his
sense
that
they
were
all
three
serious
beings
worthy
to
deal
with
fine
realities
she
attracted
crowds
to
her
theatre
but
to
his
appreciation
of
such
a
fact
as
that
important
doubtless
in
its
way
there
were
the
limits
he
had
already
expressed
what
he
now
felt
bound
in
all
integrity
to
register
was
his
perception
that
she
had
in
general
and
quite
apart
from
the
question
of
the
a
remarkable
a
very
remarkable
artistic
nature
he
allowed
that
she
had
surprised
him
here
knowing
of
her
in
other
days
mainly
that
she
was
hungry
to
adopt
an
overrated
profession
he
had
not
imputed
to
her
the
normal
measure
of
intelligence
now
he
saw
he
had
had
some
talks
with
her
that
she
was
capable
almost
of
a
violent
play
of
mind
so
much
so
that
he
was
sorry
for
the
embarrassment
it
would
be
to
her
nick
could
imagine
the
discomfort
of
having
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
mind
to
arrange
for
in
such
conditions
she
a
woman
of
the
best
intentions
really
of
the
best
nash
explained
kindly
and
lucidly
almost
paternally
and
the
quite
rare
head
you
can
see
for
yourself
miriam
smiling
as
she
sat
on
an
old
venetian
chair
held
aloft
with
the
noblest
effect
that
quarter
of
her
person
to
which
this
patronage
was
extended
remarking
to
her
host
that
strange
as
it
might
appear
she
had
got
quite
to
like
poor
nash
she
could
make
him
go
about
with
her
it
was
a
relief
to
her
mother
when
i
take
him
she
has
perfect
peace
the
girl
said
then
she
can
stay
at
home
and
see
the
interviewers
she
delights
in
that
and
i
hate
it
so
our
friend
here
is
a
great
comfort
of
course
a
de
is
supposed
to
be
able
to
go
out
alone
but
there
a
kind
of
an
added
in
having
some
one
people
think
he
my
i
sure
they
fancy
i
pay
him
i
pay
him
if
he
take
it
and
perhaps
he
will
yet
rather
than
give
him
up
for
it
matter
that
he
not
a
lady
he
one
in
tact
and
sympathy
as
you
see
and
base
as
he
thinks
the
sort
of
thing
i
do
he
ca
keep
away
from
the
theatre
when
you
celebrated
people
will
look
at
you
who
could
never
before
find
out
for
themselves
why
they
should
when
you
celebrated
you
grow
handsomer
at
least
that
what
has
happened
to
you
though
you
were
pretty
too
of
old
gabriel
placidly
argued
i
go
to
the
theatre
to
look
at
your
head
it
gives
me
the
greatest
pleasure
i
take
up
anything
of
that
sort
as
soon
as
i
find
it
one
never
knows
how
long
it
may
last
are
you
attributing
that
uncertainty
to
my
appearance
miriam
beautifully
asked
dear
no
to
my
own
pleasure
the
first
precious
bloom
of
it
nash
went
on
dormer
at
least
let
me
tell
you
in
justice
to
him
has
waited
till
you
were
celebrated
to
want
to
see
you
again
he
stands
there
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
had
the
least
idea
of
your
renown
i
had
to
announce
it
to
him
have
you
seen
me
act
miriam
put
without
reproach
to
her
host
i
go
he
handsomely
declared
you
have
your
terrible
house
have
you
what
do
they
call
it
the
demands
of
public
life
miriam
continued
in
answer
to
which
gabriel
explained
that
he
had
the
demands
of
private
life
as
well
inasmuch
as
he
was
in
love
he
was
on
the
point
of
being
married
she
listened
to
this
with
participation
then
she
said
ah
then
do
bring
your
what
do
they
call
her
in
english
i
always
afraid
of
saying
something
improper
your
i
send
you
a
box
under
the
circumstances
you
like
that
better
she
added
that
if
he
were
to
paint
her
he
would
have
to
see
her
often
on
the
stage
would
he
to
profit
by
the
de
la
what
did
they
call
in
english
studying
her
and
fixing
his
impression
but
before
he
had
time
to
meet
this
proposition
she
asked
him
if
it
disgusted
him
to
hear
her
speak
like
that
as
if
she
were
always
posing
and
thinking
about
herself
living
only
to
be
looked
at
thrusting
forward
her
person
she
already
often
got
sick
of
doing
so
but
la
guerre
comme
à
la
that
the
fine
artistic
nature
you
see
a
sort
of
divine
disgust
breaking
out
in
her
nash
expounded
if
you
want
to
paint
me
all
at
all
of
course
i
struck
with
the
way
i
taking
that
for
granted
the
girl
decently
continued
when
nash
spoke
of
it
to
me
i
jumped
at
the
idea
i
remembered
our
meeting
in
paris
and
the
kind
things
you
said
to
me
but
no
doubt
one
ought
to
jump
at
ideas
when
they
represent
serious
sacrifices
on
the
part
of
others
does
she
speak
well
nash
demanded
of
nick
oh
she
go
far
it
a
great
privilege
to
me
to
paint
you
what
title
in
the
world
have
i
to
pretend
to
such
a
model
nick
replied
to
miriam
the
sacrifice
is
yours
a
sacrifice
of
time
and
good
nature
and
credulity
you
come
in
your
bright
beauty
and
your
genius
to
this
shabby
place
where
nothing
worth
speaking
of
to
show
not
a
guarantee
to
offer
you
and
i
wonder
what
i
done
to
deserve
such
a
gift
of
the
gods
does
speak
well
and
nash
appealed
with
radiance
to
their
companion
she
took
no
notice
of
him
only
repeating
to
nick
that
she
forgotten
his
friendly
attitude
in
paris
and
when
he
answered
that
he
surely
had
done
very
little
she
broke
out
first
resting
her
eyes
on
him
with
a
deep
reasonable
smile
and
then
springing
up
quickly
ah
well
if
i
must
justify
myself
i
liked
you
fancy
my
appearing
to
challenge
you
laughed
nick
in
deprecation
to
see
you
again
is
to
want
tremendously
to
try
something
but
you
must
have
an
infinite
patience
because
i
an
awful
duffer
she
looked
round
the
walls
i
see
what
you
done
des
she
understands
she
understands
gabriel
dropped
and
he
added
to
their
visitor
imagine
when
he
might
do
something
his
choosing
a
life
of
shams
at
bottom
he
like
you
a
wonderful
artistic
nature
i
have
patience
said
the
girl
smiling
at
nick
then
my
children
i
leave
you
the
peace
of
the
lord
be
with
you
with
which
words
nash
took
his
departure
the
others
chose
a
position
for
the
young
woman
sitting
after
she
had
placed
herself
in
many
different
attitudes
and
different
lights
but
an
hour
had
elapsed
before
nick
got
to
work
began
on
a
large
canvas
to
knock
her
in
as
he
called
it
he
was
hindered
even
by
the
fine
element
of
agitation
the
emotion
of
finding
himself
out
of
a
clear
sky
confronted
with
such
a
subject
and
launched
in
such
a
task
what
could
the
situation
be
but
incongruous
just
after
he
had
formally
renounced
all
manner
of
art
the
renunciation
taking
effect
not
a
bit
the
less
from
the
whim
he
had
all
consciously
treated
himself
to
a
whim
the
last
he
should
ever
descend
to
the
freak
of
a
relapse
into
a
fingering
of
old
sketches
for
the
purpose
as
he
might
have
said
of
burning
them
up
of
clearing
out
his
studio
and
terminating
his
lease
there
were
both
embarrassment
and
inspiration
in
the
strange
chance
of
snatching
back
for
an
hour
a
relinquished
joy
the
jump
with
which
he
found
he
could
still
rise
to
such
an
occasion
took
away
his
breath
a
little
at
the
same
time
that
the
idea
the
idea
of
what
one
might
make
of
such
material
touched
him
with
an
irresistible
wand
on
the
spot
to
his
inner
vision
miriam
became
a
rich
result
drawing
a
hundred
formative
forces
out
of
their
troubled
sleep
defying
him
where
he
privately
felt
strongest
and
imposing
herself
triumphantly
in
her
own
strength
he
had
the
good
fortune
without
striking
matches
to
see
her
as
a
subject
in
a
vivid
light
and
his
quick
attempt
was
as
exciting
as
a
sudden
gallop
he
might
have
been
astride
in
a
boundless
field
of
a
runaway
horse
she
was
in
her
way
so
fine
that
he
could
only
think
how
to
do
her
that
hard
calculation
soon
flattened
out
the
consciousness
lively
in
him
at
first
that
she
was
a
beautiful
woman
who
had
sought
him
out
of
his
retirement
at
the
end
of
their
first
sitting
her
having
done
so
appeared
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
he
had
a
perfect
right
to
entertain
her
there
explanations
and
complications
were
engulfed
in
the
productive
mood
the
business
of
knocking
her
in
held
up
a
lamp
to
her
beauty
showed
him
how
much
there
was
of
it
and
that
she
was
infinitely
interesting
he
did
want
to
fall
in
love
with
her
that
be
a
sell
he
said
to
himself
and
she
promptly
became
much
too
interesting
for
it
nick
might
have
reflected
for
simplification
sake
as
his
cousin
peter
had
done
but
with
more
validity
that
he
was
engaged
with
miss
rooth
in
an
undertaking
which
did
in
the
least
refer
to
themselves
that
they
were
working
together
seriously
and
that
decent
work
quite
gainsaid
sensibility
the
humbugging
sorts
alone
had
to
help
themselves
out
with
it
but
after
her
first
sitting
she
came
poor
girl
but
twice
the
need
of
such
exorcisms
passed
from
his
spirit
he
had
so
thoroughly
so
practically
taken
her
up
as
to
whether
his
visitor
had
the
same
bright
and
still
sense
of
to
a
definite
end
the
sense
of
the
distinctively
technical
nature
of
the
answer
to
every
question
to
which
the
occasion
might
give
birth
that
mystery
would
be
lighted
only
were
it
open
to
us
to
regard
this
young
lady
through
some
other
medium
than
the
mind
of
her
friends
we
have
chosen
as
it
happens
for
some
of
the
great
advantages
it
carries
with
it
the
indirect
vision
and
it
fails
as
yet
to
tell
us
what
nick
of
course
wondered
about
before
he
ceased
to
care
as
indeed
he
intimated
to
her
why
a
budding
celebrity
should
have
dreamed
of
there
being
something
for
her
in
so
blighted
a
spot
she
should
have
gone
to
one
of
the
regular
people
the
great
people
they
would
have
welcomed
her
with
open
arms
when
nick
asked
her
if
some
of
the
had
expressed
a
wish
for
a
crack
at
her
she
replied
oh
dear
no
only
the
tiresome
photographers
and
fancy
in
the
future
if
mamma
could
only
do
for
me
and
she
added
with
the
charming
fellowship
for
which
she
was
conspicuous
at
these
hours
you
know
i
do
think
any
one
yet
has
been
quite
so
much
struck
with
me
as
you
not
even
peter
sherringham
her
host
jested
while
he
stepped
back
to
judge
of
the
effect
of
a
line
oh
sherringham
different
you
an
artist
for
pity
sake
do
say
that
he
cried
and
as
regards
art
i
thought
peter
knew
more
than
any
one
ah
you
severe
said
miriam
severe
because
that
what
the
poor
dear
thinks
but
he
does
know
a
lot
he
has
been
a
providence
to
me
then
why
has
he
come
over
to
see
you
act
she
had
a
pause
how
do
you
know
he
has
come
because
i
take
for
granted
he
have
called
on
me
if
he
had
does
he
like
you
very
much
the
girl
asked
i
do
know
i
like
he
a
gentleman
she
said
oh
yes
for
that
nick
went
on
absently
labouring
hard
but
he
afraid
of
me
afraid
to
see
me
does
he
think
you
good
enough
on
the
contrary
he
believes
i
shall
carry
him
away
and
he
in
a
terror
of
my
doing
it
he
ought
to
like
that
said
nick
with
conscious
folly
that
what
i
mean
when
i
say
he
not
an
artist
however
he
declares
he
does
like
it
only
it
appears
to
be
not
the
right
thing
for
him
oh
the
right
thing
he
ravenous
for
that
but
it
not
for
me
to
blame
him
since
i
am
too
he
coming
some
night
however
then
she
added
almost
grimly
he
shall
have
a
dose
poor
peter
nick
returned
with
a
compassion
none
the
less
real
because
it
was
mirthful
the
girl
tone
was
so
expressive
of
easy
unscrupulous
power
he
such
a
curious
mixture
she
luxuriously
went
on
sometimes
i
quite
lose
patience
with
him
it
is
exactly
trying
to
serve
both
god
and
mammon
but
it
muddling
up
the
stage
and
the
world
the
world
be
hanged
the
stage
or
anything
of
that
sort
i
mean
one
artistic
conscience
one
true
faith
comes
first
brava
brava
you
do
me
good
nick
murmured
still
amused
beguiled
and
at
work
but
it
very
kind
of
you
when
i
was
in
this
absurd
state
of
ignorance
to
impute
to
me
the
honour
of
having
been
more
struck
with
you
than
any
one
else
he
continued
after
a
moment
yes
i
confess
i
do
quite
see
when
the
shops
were
full
of
my
photographs
oh
i
so
poor
i
do
go
into
shops
he
explained
are
you
very
poor
i
live
on
alms
and
do
they
pay
you
the
government
the
ministry
dear
young
lady
for
what
for
shutting
myself
up
with
beautiful
women
ah
you
others
then
she
extravagantly
groaned
they
not
so
kind
as
you
i
confess
i
buy
it
from
you
what
you
doing
i
pay
you
well
when
done
said
the
girl
i
got
money
now
i
make
it
you
know
a
good
lot
of
it
it
too
delightful
after
scraping
and
starving
try
it
and
you
see
give
up
the
base
bad
world
but
is
it
supposed
to
be
the
base
bad
world
that
pays
precisely
make
it
pay
without
mercy
knock
it
silly
squeeze
it
dry
that
what
it
meant
for
to
pay
for
art
ah
if
it
was
for
that
i
bring
you
a
quantity
of
photographs
you
must
let
me
come
back
it
so
amusing
to
have
them
by
the
hundred
all
for
nothing
to
give
away
that
what
takes
mamma
most
she
ca
get
over
it
that
luxury
and
glory
even
at
castle
nugent
they
did
do
that
people
used
to
sketch
me
but
not
so
much
as
mamma
bien
le
and
in
all
my
life
i
never
had
but
one
poor
little
when
i
was
sixteen
in
a
plaid
frock
with
the
banks
of
a
river
at
three
francs
the
dozen
xxvi
it
was
success
the
member
for
harsh
felt
that
had
made
her
finer
the
full
possession
of
her
talent
and
the
sense
of
the
recognition
of
it
there
was
an
intimation
in
her
presence
if
he
had
given
his
mind
to
it
that
for
him
too
the
same
cause
would
produce
the
same
effect
that
is
would
show
him
how
being
launched
in
the
practice
of
an
art
makes
strange
and
prompt
revelations
nick
felt
clumsy
beside
a
person
who
manifestly
now
had
such
an
extraordinary
familiarity
with
the
esthetic
point
of
view
he
remembered
too
the
clumsiness
that
had
been
in
his
visitor
something
silly
and
shabby
pert
rather
than
proper
and
of
quite
another
value
than
her
actual
smartness
as
london
people
would
call
it
her
and
her
evident
command
of
more
than
one
manner
handsome
as
she
had
been
the
year
before
she
had
suggested
sordid
lodgings
bread
and
butter
heavy
tragedy
and
tears
and
if
then
she
was
an
girl
with
thick
hair
who
wanted
to
be
an
actress
she
was
already
in
these
few
weeks
a
performer
who
could
even
produce
an
impression
of
not
performing
she
showed
what
a
light
hand
she
could
have
forbore
to
startle
and
looked
as
well
for
unprofessional
life
as
julia
which
was
only
the
perfection
of
her
professional
character
this
function
came
out
much
in
her
talk
for
there
were
many
little
bursts
of
confidence
as
well
as
many
familiar
pauses
as
she
sat
there
and
she
was
ready
to
tell
nick
the
whole
history
of
her
the
chance
that
had
suddenly
turned
up
and
that
she
had
caught
with
a
fierce
leap
as
it
passed
he
missed
some
of
the
details
in
his
attention
to
his
own
task
and
some
of
them
he
failed
to
understand
attached
as
they
were
to
the
name
of
mr
basil
dashwood
which
he
heard
for
the
first
time
it
was
through
dashwood
extraordinary
exertions
that
a
hearing
a
morning
performance
at
a
london
theatre
had
been
obtained
for
her
that
had
been
the
great
step
for
it
had
led
to
the
putting
on
at
night
of
the
play
at
the
same
theatre
in
place
of
a
wretched
thing
they
were
trying
it
was
no
use
to
keep
on
its
feet
and
to
her
engagement
for
the
principal
part
she
had
made
a
hit
in
it
she
could
pretend
not
to
know
that
but
she
was
already
tired
of
it
there
were
so
many
other
things
she
wanted
to
do
and
when
she
thought
it
would
probably
run
a
month
or
two
more
she
fell
to
cursing
the
odious
conditions
of
artistic
production
in
such
an
age
the
play
was
a
more
or
less
idiotised
version
of
a
new
french
piece
a
thing
that
had
taken
in
paris
at
a
theatre
and
was
now
proving
itself
in
london
good
enough
for
houses
mainly
made
up
of
stalls
it
was
dashwood
who
had
said
it
would
go
if
they
could
get
the
rights
and
a
fellow
to
make
some
changes
he
had
discovered
it
at
a
nasty
little
place
she
had
never
been
to
over
the
seine
they
had
got
the
rights
and
the
fellow
who
had
made
the
changes
was
practically
dashwood
himself
there
was
another
man
in
london
gushmore
miriam
did
know
if
nick
had
heard
of
him
nick
had
who
had
done
some
of
it
it
had
been
awfully
chopped
down
to
a
mere
bone
with
the
meat
all
gone
but
that
was
what
people
in
london
seemed
to
like
they
were
very
innocent
thousands
of
little
dogs
amusing
themselves
with
a
bone
at
any
rate
she
had
made
something
she
had
made
a
figure
of
the
woman
a
dreadful
stick
with
what
dashwood
had
muddled
her
into
and
miriam
added
in
the
complacency
of
her
young
expansion
oh
give
me
fifty
words
any
time
and
the
ghost
of
a
situation
and
i
set
you
up
somebody
besides
i
must
abuse
poor
yolande
she
has
saved
us
she
said
our
ridiculous
play
that
the
name
of
the
impossible
woman
she
has
put
bread
into
our
mouths
and
she
a
loaf
on
the
shelf
for
the
future
the
rights
are
mine
you
lucky
to
have
them
said
nick
a
little
vaguely
troubled
about
his
sitter
nose
which
was
somehow
jewish
without
the
convex
arch
indeed
i
am
he
gave
them
to
me
was
it
charming
gave
them
mr
dashwood
dear
me
no
where
should
poor
dashwood
have
got
them
he
has
a
penny
in
the
world
besides
if
he
had
got
them
he
have
kept
them
i
mean
your
blessed
cousin
i
see
they
a
present
from
peter
like
many
other
things
is
he
a
dear
if
it
had
been
for
him
the
shelf
would
have
remained
bare
he
bought
the
play
for
this
country
and
america
for
four
hundred
pounds
and
on
the
chance
fancy
there
was
no
rush
for
it
and
how
could
he
tell
and
then
he
gracefully
pressed
it
on
me
so
i
my
little
capital
is
he
a
duck
you
nice
cousins
nick
assented
to
the
proposition
only
inserting
an
amendment
to
the
effect
that
surely
peter
had
nice
cousins
too
and
making
as
he
went
on
with
his
work
a
tacit
preoccupied
reflexion
or
two
such
as
that
it
must
be
pleasant
to
render
little
services
like
that
to
youth
beauty
and
genius
he
rather
wondered
how
peter
could
afford
them
and
that
duck
as
he
was
miss
rooth
benefactor
was
rather
taken
for
granted
vos
non
softly
sounded
in
his
brain
this
community
of
interests
or
at
least
of
relations
quickened
the
flight
of
time
so
that
he
was
still
fresh
when
the
sitting
came
to
an
end
it
was
settled
miriam
should
come
back
on
the
morrow
to
enable
her
artist
to
make
the
most
of
the
few
days
of
the
parliamentary
recess
and
just
before
she
left
him
she
asked
then
you
come
without
fail
i
hate
to
lose
an
hour
of
you
then
i
place
you
it
will
be
my
affair
you
very
kind
he
quite
rose
to
it
is
it
a
simple
matter
for
me
to
take
a
stall
this
week
i
suppose
they
to
be
had
i
send
you
a
box
said
miriam
you
shall
do
it
well
there
are
plenty
now
why
should
i
be
lost
all
alone
in
the
grandeur
of
a
box
ca
you
bring
your
friend
my
friend
the
lady
you
engaged
to
unfortunately
she
out
of
town
miriam
looked
at
him
in
the
grand
manner
does
she
leave
you
alone
like
that
she
thought
i
should
like
it
i
should
be
more
free
to
paint
you
see
i
am
yes
perhaps
it
good
for
have
you
got
her
portrait
miriam
asked
she
does
like
me
to
paint
her
really
perhaps
then
she
wo
like
you
to
paint
me
that
why
i
want
to
be
quick
laughed
nick
before
she
knows
it
shell
know
it
i
shall
write
to
her
the
girl
faced
him
again
portentously
i
see
you
afraid
of
her
but
she
added
mention
my
name
they
give
you
the
box
at
the
office
whether
or
no
nick
were
afraid
of
dallow
he
still
waved
away
this
bounty
protesting
that
he
would
rather
take
a
stall
according
to
his
wont
and
pay
for
it
which
led
his
guest
to
declare
with
a
sudden
flicker
of
passion
that
if
he
did
do
as
she
wished
she
would
never
sit
to
him
again
ah
then
you
have
me
he
had
to
reply
only
i
see
why
you
should
give
me
so
many
things
what
in
the
world
have
i
given
you
why
an
idea
and
nick
looked
at
his
picture
rather
ruefully
i
mean
to
say
though
that
i
have
let
it
fall
and
smashed
it
ah
an
idea
that
a
great
thing
for
people
in
our
line
but
see
me
much
better
from
the
box
and
i
send
you
gabriel
nash
she
got
into
the
hansom
her
host
servant
had
fetched
for
her
and
as
nick
turned
back
into
his
studio
after
watching
her
drive
away
he
laughed
at
the
conception
that
they
were
in
the
same
line
he
did
share
in
the
event
his
box
at
the
theatre
with
nash
who
talked
during
the
not
in
the
least
about
the
performance
or
the
performer
but
about
the
possible
greatness
of
the
art
of
the
portraitist
its
reach
its
range
its
fascination
the
magnificent
examples
it
had
left
us
in
the
past
windows
open
into
history
into
psychology
things
that
were
among
the
most
precious
possessions
of
the
human
race
he
insisted
above
all
on
the
interest
the
importance
of
this
great
peculiarity
of
it
that
unlike
most
other
forms
it
was
a
revelation
of
two
realities
the
man
whom
it
was
the
artist
conscious
effort
to
reveal
and
the
man
the
interpreter
expressed
in
the
very
quality
and
temper
of
that
effort
it
offered
a
double
vision
the
strongest
dose
of
life
that
art
could
give
the
strongest
dose
of
art
that
life
could
give
nick
dormer
had
already
become
aware
of
having
two
states
of
mind
when
listening
to
this
philosopher
one
in
which
he
laughed
doubted
sometimes
even
reprobated
failed
to
follow
or
accept
and
another
in
which
his
old
friend
seemed
to
take
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
to
utter
for
him
better
and
more
completely
the
very
things
he
was
on
the
point
of
saying
gabriel
saying
them
at
such
moments
appeared
to
make
them
true
to
set
them
up
in
the
world
and
he
said
a
good
many
especially
as
to
the
happiness
of
cultivating
own
garden
growing
there
in
stillness
and
freedom
certain
strong
pure
flowers
that
would
bloom
for
ever
bloom
long
after
the
rank
weeds
of
the
hour
were
withered
and
blown
away
it
was
to
keep
miriam
rooth
in
his
eye
for
his
current
work
that
nick
had
come
to
the
play
and
she
dwelt
there
all
the
evening
being
constantly
on
the
stage
he
was
so
occupied
in
watching
her
face
for
he
now
saw
pretty
clearly
what
he
should
attempt
to
make
of
it
that
he
was
conscious
only
in
a
secondary
degree
of
the
story
she
illustrated
and
had
in
regard
to
her
acting
a
surprised
sense
that
she
was
extraordinarily
quiet
he
remembered
her
loudness
her
violence
in
paris
at
peter
sherringham
her
wild
wails
the
first
time
at
madame
carré
compared
with
which
her
present
manner
was
eminently
temperate
and
modern
nick
dormer
was
not
critical
at
the
theatre
he
believed
what
he
saw
and
had
a
pleasant
sense
of
the
inevitable
therefore
he
would
have
guessed
what
gabriel
nash
had
to
tell
him
that
for
this
young
woman
with
her
tragic
cast
and
her
peculiar
attributes
her
present
performance
full
of
actuality
of
light
fine
indications
and
at
moments
of
pointed
touches
of
comedy
was
a
rare
de
it
went
on
altogether
in
a
register
he
had
supposed
her
to
possess
and
in
which
as
he
said
she
did
touch
her
capital
doing
it
all
with
her
wonderful
little
savings
it
conveyed
to
him
that
she
was
capable
of
almost
anything
in
one
of
the
intervals
they
went
round
to
see
her
but
for
nick
this
purpose
was
partly
defeated
by
the
extravagant
transports
as
they
struck
him
of
rooth
whom
they
found
sitting
with
her
daughter
and
who
attacked
him
with
a
hundred
questions
about
his
dear
mother
and
his
charming
sisters
she
had
volumes
to
say
about
the
day
in
paris
when
they
had
shown
her
the
kindness
she
should
never
forget
she
abounded
also
in
admiration
of
the
portrait
he
had
so
cleverly
begun
declaring
she
was
so
eager
to
see
it
however
little
he
might
as
yet
have
accomplished
that
she
should
do
herself
the
honour
to
wait
upon
him
in
the
morning
when
miriam
came
to
sit
i
acting
for
you
the
girl
more
effectively
said
before
he
returned
to
his
place
no
that
exactly
what
you
not
doing
nash
interposed
with
one
of
his
happy
sagacities
you
stopped
acting
you
reduced
it
to
the
least
that
will
do
you
simply
are
you
just
the
visible
image
the
picture
on
the
wall
it
keeps
you
wonderfully
in
focus
i
never
seen
you
so
beautiful
miriam
stared
at
this
then
it
could
be
seen
that
she
coloured
what
a
luxury
in
life
to
have
everything
explained
he
the
great
explainer
she
herself
explained
to
nick
he
shook
hands
with
her
for
well
then
we
must
give
him
lots
to
do
she
came
to
his
studio
in
the
morning
but
unaccompanied
by
her
mother
in
allusion
to
whom
she
simply
said
mamma
wished
to
come
but
i
would
let
her
they
proceeded
promptly
to
business
the
girl
divested
herself
of
her
hat
and
coat
taking
the
position
already
determined
after
they
had
worked
more
than
an
hour
with
much
less
talk
than
the
day
before
nick
being
extremely
absorbed
and
miriam
wearing
in
silence
an
air
of
noble
compunction
for
the
burden
imposed
on
him
at
the
end
of
this
period
of
patience
pervaded
by
a
holy
calm
our
young
lady
suddenly
got
up
and
exclaimed
i
say
i
must
see
it
with
which
quickly
she
stepped
down
from
her
place
and
came
round
to
the
canvas
she
had
at
nick
request
not
looked
at
his
work
the
day
before
he
fell
back
glad
to
rest
and
put
down
his
palette
and
brushes
bien
she
cried
as
she
stood
before
the
easel
nick
was
pleased
with
her
ejaculation
he
was
even
pleased
with
what
he
had
done
he
had
had
a
long
happy
spurt
and
felt
excited
and
sanctioned
miriam
retreating
also
a
little
sank
into
a
chair
that
stood
two
or
three
yards
from
the
picture
and
reclined
in
it
her
head
on
one
side
looking
at
the
rough
resemblance
she
made
a
remark
or
two
about
it
to
which
nick
replied
standing
behind
her
and
after
a
moment
leaning
on
the
top
of
the
chair
he
was
away
from
his
work
and
his
eyes
searched
it
with
a
shy
fondness
of
hope
they
rose
however
as
he
presently
became
conscious
that
the
door
of
the
large
room
opposite
him
had
opened
without
making
a
sound
and
that
some
one
stood
upon
the
threshold
the
person
on
the
threshold
was
julia
dallow
as
soon
as
he
was
aware
nick
wished
he
had
posted
a
letter
to
her
the
night
before
he
had
written
only
that
morning
there
was
nevertheless
genuine
joy
in
the
words
with
which
he
bounded
toward
her
ah
my
dear
julia
what
a
jolly
surprise
for
her
unannounced
descent
spoke
to
him
above
all
of
an
irresistible
desire
to
see
him
again
sooner
than
they
had
arranged
she
had
taken
a
step
forward
but
she
had
done
no
more
stopping
short
at
the
sight
of
the
strange
woman
so
divested
of
that
she
looked
who
lounged
familiarly
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
over
whom
nick
had
been
still
more
familiarly
hanging
julia
eyes
rested
on
this
embodied
unexpectedness
and
as
they
did
so
she
grew
pale
so
pale
that
nick
observing
it
instinctively
looked
back
to
see
what
miriam
had
done
to
produce
such
an
effect
she
had
done
nothing
at
all
which
was
precisely
what
was
embarrassing
she
only
stared
at
the
intruder
motionless
and
superb
she
seemed
somehow
in
easy
possession
of
the
place
and
even
at
that
instant
nick
noted
how
handsome
she
looked
so
that
he
said
to
himself
inaudibly
in
some
deeper
depth
of
consciousness
how
i
should
like
to
paint
her
that
way
dallow
eyes
moved
for
a
single
moment
to
her
friend
then
they
turned
away
away
from
miriam
ranging
over
the
room
i
got
a
sitter
but
you
must
mind
that
we
taking
a
rest
delighted
to
see
you
he
was
all
cordiality
he
closed
the
door
of
the
studio
behind
her
his
servant
was
still
at
the
outer
door
which
was
open
and
through
which
he
saw
julia
carriage
drawn
up
this
made
her
advance
a
little
further
but
still
she
said
nothing
she
dropped
no
answer
even
when
nick
went
on
with
a
sense
of
awkwardness
when
did
you
come
back
i
hope
nothing
has
gone
wrong
you
come
at
a
very
interesting
moment
he
continued
aware
as
soon
as
he
had
spoken
of
something
in
his
words
that
might
have
made
her
laugh
she
was
far
from
laughing
however
she
only
managed
to
look
neither
at
him
nor
at
miriam
and
to
say
after
a
little
when
he
had
repeated
his
question
about
her
return
i
came
back
this
morning
i
came
straight
here
and
nothing
wrong
i
hope
oh
no
everything
all
right
she
returned
very
quickly
and
without
expression
she
vouchsafed
no
explanation
of
her
premature
descent
and
took
no
notice
of
the
seat
nick
offered
her
neither
did
she
appear
to
hear
him
when
he
begged
her
not
to
look
yet
at
the
work
on
the
easel
it
was
in
such
a
dreadful
state
he
was
conscious
as
he
phrased
it
that
this
request
gave
to
miriam
position
directly
in
front
of
his
canvas
an
air
of
privilege
which
her
neglect
to
recognise
in
any
way
dallow
entrance
or
her
importance
did
nothing
to
correct
but
that
mattered
less
if
the
appeal
failed
to
reach
julia
intelligence
as
he
judged
seeing
presently
how
deeply
she
was
agitated
nothing
mattered
in
face
of
the
sense
of
danger
taking
possession
of
him
after
she
had
been
in
the
room
a
few
moments
he
wanted
to
say
what
the
difficulty
has
anything
happened
but
he
felt
how
little
she
would
like
him
to
utter
words
so
intimate
in
presence
of
the
person
she
had
been
rudely
startled
to
find
between
them
he
pronounced
miriam
name
to
her
and
her
own
to
miriam
but
julia
recognition
of
the
ceremony
was
so
slight
as
to
be
scarcely
perceptible
miriam
had
the
air
of
waiting
for
something
more
before
she
herself
made
a
sign
and
as
nothing
more
came
she
continued
to
say
nothing
and
not
to
budge
nick
added
a
remark
to
the
effect
that
julia
would
remember
to
have
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
her
the
year
before
in
paris
that
day
at
old
peter
to
which
dallow
made
answer
ah
yes
without
any
qualification
while
she
looked
down
at
some
rather
rusty
studies
on
panels
ranged
along
the
floor
and
resting
against
the
base
of
the
wall
her
discomposure
was
a
clear
pain
to
herself
she
had
had
a
shock
of
extreme
violence
and
nick
saw
that
as
miriam
showed
no
symptom
of
offering
to
give
up
her
sitting
her
stay
would
be
of
the
briefest
he
wished
that
young
woman
would
do
something
say
she
would
go
get
up
move
about
as
it
was
she
had
the
appearance
of
watching
from
her
point
of
vantage
the
other
upset
he
made
a
series
of
inquiries
about
julia
doings
in
the
country
to
two
or
three
of
which
she
gave
answers
monosyllabic
and
scarcely
comprehensible
only
turning
her
eyes
round
and
round
the
room
as
in
search
of
something
she
could
find
of
an
escape
of
something
that
was
not
miriam
at
last
she
said
it
was
at
the
end
of
a
very
few
minutes
i
did
come
to
stay
when
you
so
busy
i
only
looked
in
to
see
if
you
were
here
it
charming
of
you
to
have
come
i
so
glad
you
seen
for
yourself
how
well
i
occupied
nick
replied
not
unconscious
of
how
red
he
was
this
made
dallow
look
at
him
while
miriam
considered
them
both
julia
eyes
had
a
strange
light
he
had
never
seen
before
a
flash
of
fear
by
which
he
was
himself
frightened
of
course
i
see
you
later
he
added
in
awkward
in
really
misplaced
gaiety
while
she
reached
the
door
which
she
opened
herself
getting
out
with
no
further
attention
to
miriam
i
wrote
to
you
this
morning
you
missed
my
letter
he
repeated
behind
her
having
already
given
her
this
information
the
door
of
the
studio
was
very
near
that
of
the
house
but
before
she
had
reached
the
street
the
visitors
bell
was
set
ringing
the
passage
was
narrow
and
she
kept
in
advance
of
nick
anticipating
his
motion
to
open
the
the
bell
was
tinkling
still
when
by
the
action
of
her
own
hand
a
gentleman
on
the
step
stood
revealed
ah
my
dear
do
go
nick
heard
pronounced
in
quick
soft
dissuasion
and
in
the
now
familiar
accents
of
gabriel
nash
the
rectification
followed
more
quickly
still
if
that
were
a
rectification
which
so
little
improved
the
matter
i
beg
a
thousand
pardons
i
thought
you
were
miriam
gabriel
gave
way
and
julia
the
more
sharply
pursued
her
retreat
her
carriage
a
victoria
with
a
pair
of
precious
heated
horses
had
taken
a
turn
up
the
street
but
the
coachman
had
already
seen
his
mistress
and
was
rapidly
coming
back
he
drew
near
not
so
fast
however
but
that
gabriel
nash
had
time
to
accompany
dallow
to
the
edge
of
the
pavement
with
an
apology
for
the
freedom
into
which
he
had
blundered
nick
was
at
her
other
hand
waiting
to
put
her
into
the
carriage
and
freshly
disconcerted
by
the
encounter
with
nash
who
somehow
as
he
stood
making
julia
an
explanation
that
she
did
listen
to
looked
less
eminent
than
usual
though
not
more
conscious
of
difficulties
our
young
man
coloured
deeper
and
watched
the
footman
spring
down
as
the
victoria
drove
up
he
heard
nash
say
something
about
the
honour
of
having
met
dallow
in
paris
nick
wanted
him
to
go
into
the
house
he
damned
inwardly
his
lack
of
delicacy
he
desired
a
word
with
julia
alone
as
much
alone
as
the
two
annoying
servants
would
allow
but
nash
was
not
too
much
discouraged
to
say
you
came
for
a
glimpse
of
the
great
model
does
she
sit
that
what
i
wanted
too
this
morning
just
a
look
for
a
blessing
on
the
day
ah
but
you
madam
julia
had
sprung
into
her
corner
while
he
was
still
speaking
and
had
flashed
out
to
the
coachman
a
home
which
of
itself
set
the
horses
in
motion
the
carriage
went
a
few
yards
but
while
gabriel
with
an
undiscouraged
bow
turned
away
nick
dormer
his
hand
on
the
edge
of
the
hood
moved
with
it
you
do
like
it
but
i
explain
he
tried
to
say
for
its
occupant
alone
explain
what
she
asked
still
very
pale
and
grave
but
in
a
voice
that
showed
nothing
she
was
thinking
of
the
servants
she
could
think
of
them
even
then
oh
it
all
right
i
come
in
at
five
nick
returned
gallantly
jocular
while
she
was
whirled
away
gabriel
had
gone
into
the
studio
and
nick
found
him
standing
in
admiration
before
miriam
who
had
resumed
the
position
in
which
she
was
sitting
lord
she
good
is
she
good
he
broke
out
seizing
their
host
by
the
arm
to
give
him
a
particular
view
miriam
looked
indeed
still
handsomer
than
before
and
she
had
taken
up
her
attitude
again
with
a
splendid
air
of
being
capable
of
keeping
it
for
ever
nick
said
nothing
but
went
back
to
work
with
a
tingle
of
confusion
which
began
to
act
after
he
had
resumed
his
palette
as
a
sharp
a
delightful
stimulus
miriam
spoke
never
a
word
but
she
was
doubly
grand
and
for
more
than
an
hour
till
nick
exhausted
declared
he
must
stop
the
industrious
silence
was
broken
only
by
the
desultory
discourse
of
their
friend
xxvii
nick
went
to
great
stanhope
street
at
five
and
learned
rather
to
his
surprise
that
julia
was
not
at
home
to
his
surprise
because
he
had
told
her
he
would
come
at
that
hour
and
he
attributed
to
her
with
a
certain
simplicity
an
eager
state
of
mind
in
regard
to
his
explanation
apparently
she
was
not
eager
the
eagerness
was
his
own
he
was
eager
to
explain
he
recognised
not
without
a
certain
consciousness
of
magnanimity
in
doing
so
that
there
had
been
some
reason
for
her
quick
withdrawal
from
his
studio
or
at
any
rate
for
her
extreme
discomposure
there
he
had
a
few
days
before
put
in
a
plea
for
a
snatch
of
worship
in
that
sanctuary
and
she
had
accepted
and
approved
it
but
the
worship
when
the
curtain
happened
to
blow
back
showed
for
that
of
a
magnificent
young
woman
an
actress
with
disordered
hair
who
wore
in
a
singular
degree
the
appearance
of
a
person
settled
for
many
hours
the
explanation
was
easy
it
dwelt
in
the
simple
truth
that
when
one
was
painting
even
very
badly
and
only
for
a
moment
one
had
to
have
models
nick
was
impatient
to
give
it
with
frank
affectionate
lips
and
a
full
pleasant
admission
that
it
was
natural
julia
should
have
been
startled
and
he
was
the
more
impatient
that
though
he
would
not
in
the
least
have
expected
her
to
like
finding
a
strange
woman
intimately
installed
with
him
she
had
disliked
it
even
more
than
would
have
seemed
probable
or
natural
that
was
because
not
having
heard
from
him
about
the
matter
the
impression
was
for
the
moment
irresistible
with
her
that
a
trick
had
been
played
her
but
three
minutes
with
him
alone
would
make
the
difference
they
would
indeed
have
a
considerable
difference
to
make
nick
reflected
as
minutes
much
more
numerous
elapsed
without
bringing
dallow
home
for
he
had
said
to
the
butler
that
he
would
come
in
and
wait
though
it
was
odd
she
should
not
have
left
a
message
for
him
she
would
doubtless
return
from
one
moment
to
the
other
he
had
of
course
full
licence
to
wait
anywhere
he
preferred
and
he
was
ushered
into
julia
particular
and
supplied
with
tea
and
the
evening
papers
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
however
he
gave
little
attention
to
these
beguilements
thanks
to
his
feeling
still
more
acutely
that
since
she
definitely
knew
he
was
coming
she
might
have
taken
the
trouble
to
be
at
home
he
walked
up
and
down
and
looked
out
of
the
window
took
up
her
books
and
dropped
them
again
and
then
as
half
an
hour
had
elapsed
became
aware
he
was
really
sore
what
could
she
be
about
when
with
london
a
thankless
void
she
was
of
course
not
paying
visits
a
footman
came
in
to
attend
to
the
fire
whereupon
nick
questioned
him
as
to
the
manner
in
which
she
was
possibly
engaged
the
man
disclosed
the
fact
that
his
mistress
had
gone
out
but
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
arrival
and
as
if
appreciating
the
opportunity
for
a
little
decorous
conversation
gave
him
still
more
information
than
he
invited
from
this
it
appeared
that
as
nick
knew
or
could
surmise
she
had
the
evening
before
from
the
country
wired
for
the
victoria
to
meet
her
in
the
morning
at
paddington
and
then
gone
straight
from
the
station
to
the
studio
while
her
maid
with
her
luggage
proceeded
in
a
cab
to
great
stanhope
street
on
leaving
the
studio
however
she
had
not
come
directly
home
she
had
chosen
this
unusual
season
for
an
hour
drive
in
the
park
she
had
finally
her
house
but
had
remained
upstairs
all
day
seeing
no
one
and
not
coming
down
to
luncheon
at
four
she
had
ordered
the
brougham
for
four
and
had
got
into
it
punctually
saying
to
the
park
as
she
did
so
nick
after
the
footman
had
left
him
made
what
he
could
of
sudden
passion
for
the
banks
of
the
serpentine
forsaken
and
foggy
now
inasmuch
as
the
afternoon
had
come
on
grey
and
the
light
was
waning
she
usually
hated
the
park
and
hated
a
closed
carriage
he
had
a
gruesome
vision
of
her
shrunken
into
a
corner
of
her
brougham
and
veiled
as
if
in
consequence
of
tears
revolving
round
the
solitude
of
the
drive
she
had
of
course
been
deeply
displeased
and
was
not
herself
the
motion
of
the
carriage
soothed
her
had
an
effect
on
her
nerves
nick
remembered
that
in
the
morning
at
his
door
she
had
appeared
to
be
going
home
so
she
had
plunged
into
the
drearier
resort
on
second
thoughts
and
as
she
noted
herself
near
it
he
lingered
another
walked
up
and
down
the
room
many
times
and
thought
of
many
things
had
she
misunderstood
him
when
he
said
he
would
come
at
five
could
she
be
sure
even
if
she
had
that
he
would
come
early
rather
than
late
and
might
she
have
left
a
message
for
him
on
the
chance
going
out
that
way
a
few
minutes
before
he
was
to
come
had
even
a
little
the
air
of
a
thing
done
on
purpose
to
offend
him
as
if
she
had
been
so
displeased
that
she
had
taken
the
nearest
occasion
of
giving
him
a
sign
she
meant
to
break
with
him
but
were
these
the
things
julia
did
and
was
that
the
way
she
did
them
his
fine
proud
delicate
generous
julia
when
six
came
poor
nick
felt
distinctly
resentful
but
he
stayed
ten
minutes
longer
on
the
possibility
that
she
would
in
the
morning
have
understood
him
to
mention
that
hour
the
april
dusk
began
to
gather
and
the
unsociability
of
her
behaviour
especially
if
she
were
still
rumbling
round
the
park
became
absurd
anecdotes
came
back
to
him
vaguely
remembered
heard
he
could
have
said
when
or
where
of
poor
artists
for
whom
life
had
been
rendered
difficult
by
wives
who
allow
them
the
use
of
the
living
female
model
and
who
made
scenes
if
they
encountered
on
the
staircase
such
sources
of
inspiration
these
ladies
struck
him
as
vulgar
and
odious
persons
with
whom
it
seemed
grotesque
that
julia
should
have
anything
in
common
of
course
she
was
not
his
wife
yet
and
of
course
if
she
were
he
should
have
washed
his
hands
of
every
form
of
activity
requiring
the
services
of
the
sitter
but
even
these
qualifications
left
him
with
a
power
to
wince
at
the
way
in
which
the
woman
he
was
so
sure
he
loved
just
escaped
ranking
herself
with
the
philistines
at
a
quarter
past
six
he
rang
a
bell
and
told
the
servant
who
answered
it
that
he
was
going
and
that
dallow
was
to
be
informed
as
soon
as
she
came
in
that
he
had
expected
to
find
her
and
had
waited
an
hour
and
a
quarter
but
he
had
just
reached
the
doorstep
of
departure
when
her
brougham
emerging
from
the
evening
mist
stopped
in
front
of
the
house
nick
stood
there
hanging
back
till
she
got
out
allowing
the
servants
only
to
help
her
she
saw
him
she
was
less
veiled
than
his
mental
vision
of
her
but
this
did
prevent
her
pausing
to
give
an
order
to
the
coachman
a
matter
apparently
requiring
some
discussion
when
she
came
to
the
door
her
visitor
remarked
that
he
had
been
waiting
an
eternity
to
which
she
replied
that
he
must
make
no
grievance
of
that
she
was
too
unwell
to
do
him
justice
he
immediately
professed
regret
and
sympathy
adding
however
that
in
that
case
she
had
much
better
not
have
gone
out
she
made
no
answer
to
this
there
were
three
servants
in
the
hall
who
looked
as
if
they
might
understand
at
least
what
was
not
said
to
them
only
when
he
followed
her
in
she
asked
if
his
idea
had
been
to
stay
longer
certainly
if
you
not
too
ill
to
see
me
come
in
then
julia
said
turning
back
after
having
gone
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
this
struck
him
immediately
as
a
further
restriction
of
his
visit
she
would
readmit
him
to
the
or
to
her
boudoir
she
would
receive
him
in
the
impersonal
apartment
downstairs
where
she
saw
people
on
business
what
did
she
want
to
do
to
him
he
was
prepared
by
this
time
for
a
scene
of
jealousy
since
he
was
sure
he
had
learned
to
read
her
character
justly
in
feeling
that
if
she
had
the
appearance
of
a
cold
woman
a
forked
flame
in
her
was
liable
on
occasion
to
break
out
she
was
very
still
but
from
time
to
time
she
would
fire
off
a
pistol
as
soon
as
he
had
closed
the
door
she
said
without
sitting
down
i
daresay
you
saw
i
did
like
that
at
all
my
having
a
sitter
in
that
professional
way
i
was
very
much
annoyed
at
it
myself
nick
answered
why
were
annoyed
she
very
handsome
dallow
perversely
said
i
did
know
you
had
looked
at
her
nick
laughed
julia
had
a
pause
was
i
very
rude
oh
it
was
all
right
it
was
only
awkward
for
me
because
you
know
he
replied
i
did
know
that
why
i
came
how
do
you
mean
my
letter
could
have
reached
you
i
do
know
anything
about
your
letter
julia
cast
about
her
for
a
chair
and
then
seated
herself
on
the
edge
of
a
sofa
with
her
eyes
on
the
floor
she
sat
to
me
yesterday
she
was
there
all
the
morning
but
i
write
to
tell
you
i
went
at
her
with
great
energy
and
absurd
as
it
may
seem
to
you
found
myself
very
tired
afterwards
besides
in
the
evening
i
went
to
see
her
act
does
she
act
asked
dallow
she
an
actress
it
her
profession
do
you
remember
her
that
day
at
peter
in
paris
she
already
a
celebrity
she
has
great
talent
she
engaged
at
a
theatre
here
and
is
making
a
sensation
as
i
tell
you
i
saw
her
last
night
you
need
tell
me
julia
returned
looking
up
at
him
with
a
face
of
which
the
intense
the
tragic
sadness
startled
him
he
had
been
standing
before
her
but
at
this
he
instantly
sat
down
close
taking
her
passive
hand
i
want
to
please
otherwise
it
must
seem
so
odd
to
you
i
knew
she
was
coming
when
i
wrote
to
you
the
day
before
yesterday
but
i
did
tell
you
then
because
i
did
know
how
it
would
turn
out
and
i
did
want
to
exult
in
advance
over
a
poor
little
attempt
that
might
come
to
nothing
moreover
it
was
no
use
speaking
of
the
matter
at
all
unless
i
told
you
exactly
how
it
had
come
about
nick
went
on
explaining
kindly
and
copiously
it
was
the
result
of
a
visit
unexpectedly
paid
me
by
gabriel
nash
that
man
the
man
who
spoke
to
me
her
memory
of
him
shuddered
into
life
he
did
what
he
thought
would
please
you
but
i
daresay
it
did
you
met
him
in
paris
and
did
like
him
so
i
judged
best
to
hold
my
tongue
about
him
do
like
him
very
much
great
heaven
julia
ejaculated
almost
under
her
breath
the
reason
i
was
annoyed
was
because
somehow
when
you
came
in
i
suddenly
had
the
air
of
having
got
out
of
those
visits
and
shut
myself
up
in
town
to
do
something
that
i
had
kept
from
you
and
i
have
been
very
unhappy
till
i
could
explain
you
do
explain
you
ca
explain
mrs
dallow
declared
turning
on
her
companion
eyes
which
in
spite
of
her
studied
stillness
expressed
deep
excitement
i
knew
it
i
knew
everything
that
why
i
came
it
was
a
sort
of
what
they
call
a
brainwave
nick
smiled
i
felt
uneasy
i
felt
a
kind
of
call
it
came
suddenly
yesterday
it
was
irresistible
nothing
could
have
kept
me
this
morning
that
very
serious
but
it
still
more
delightful
you
must
go
away
again
said
nick
we
must
stick
together
forever
and
ever
he
put
his
arm
round
her
but
she
detached
herself
as
soon
as
she
felt
its
pressure
she
rose
quickly
moving
away
while
mystified
he
sat
looking
up
at
her
as
she
had
looked
a
few
moments
before
at
him
thought
it
all
over
i
been
thinking
of
it
all
day
she
began
that
why
i
did
come
in
do
think
of
it
too
much
it
is
worth
it
you
like
it
more
than
anything
else
you
do
you
ca
deny
it
she
went
on
my
dear
child
what
are
you
talking
about
nick
asked
gently
that
what
you
like
doing
what
you
were
this
morning
with
women
lolling
with
their
things
off
to
be
painted
and
people
like
that
man
nick
slowly
got
up
hesitating
my
dear
julia
apart
from
the
surprise
this
morning
do
you
object
to
the
living
model
not
a
bit
for
you
what
the
inconvenience
then
since
in
my
studio
they
only
for
me
you
love
it
you
revel
in
it
that
what
you
want
the
only
thing
you
want
julia
broke
out
to
have
models
lolling
undressed
women
do
you
mean
that
what
i
felt
what
i
knew
she
went
on
what
came
over
me
and
haunted
me
yesterday
so
that
i
could
throw
it
off
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
i
could
see
it
with
my
eyes
and
have
the
perfect
proof
i
should
feel
better
i
should
be
quiet
and
now
i
quiet
after
a
struggle
of
some
hours
i
confess
i
seen
the
whole
thing
before
me
and
i
satisfied
i
not
to
me
neither
the
whole
thing
nor
half
of
it
is
before
me
what
exactly
are
you
talking
about
nick
demanded
about
what
you
were
doing
this
morning
that
your
innermost
preference
that
your
secret
passion
a
feeble
scratch
at
something
serious
yes
it
was
almost
serious
he
said
but
it
was
an
accident
this
morning
and
yesterday
i
got
on
less
wretchedly
than
i
intended
i
sure
you
immense
talent
julia
returned
with
a
dreariness
that
was
almost
droll
no
no
i
might
have
had
i
plucked
it
up
it
too
late
for
it
to
flower
my
dear
julia
i
perfectly
incompetent
and
perfectly
resigned
yes
you
looked
so
this
morning
when
you
hung
over
her
oh
bring
back
your
talent
she
an
obliging
and
even
an
intelligent
creature
and
i
no
doubt
she
would
if
she
could
nick
conceded
but
i
received
from
you
all
the
help
any
woman
destined
to
give
me
no
one
can
do
for
me
again
what
you
done
i
should
try
it
again
i
acted
in
ignorance
oh
i
thought
it
all
out
julia
declared
and
then
with
a
strange
face
of
anguish
resting
on
his
own
before
it
too
late
before
it
too
late
too
late
for
what
for
you
to
be
free
for
you
to
be
free
and
for
me
for
me
to
be
free
too
you
hate
everything
i
like
she
flashed
out
do
pretend
pretend
she
went
on
as
a
sound
of
protest
broke
from
him
i
thought
you
so
awfully
me
to
paint
he
gasped
flushed
and
staring
i
do
i
do
that
why
you
must
be
free
why
we
must
part
why
we
must
part
oh
i
turned
it
well
over
i
faced
the
hard
truth
it
would
do
at
all
julia
rang
out
i
like
the
way
you
talk
of
it
as
if
it
were
a
trimming
for
your
dress
nick
retorted
with
bitterness
wo
it
do
for
you
to
be
loved
and
cherished
as
well
as
any
woman
in
england
she
turned
away
from
him
closing
her
eyes
as
not
to
see
something
dangerous
you
must
give
anything
up
for
me
i
should
feel
it
all
the
while
and
i
should
hate
it
i
not
afraid
of
the
truth
but
you
are
the
truth
dear
julia
i
only
want
to
know
it
nick
insisted
it
seems
to
me
in
fact
just
what
i
got
hold
of
when
two
persons
are
united
by
the
tenderest
affection
and
are
sane
and
generous
and
just
no
difficulties
that
occur
in
the
union
their
life
makes
for
them
are
insurmountable
no
problems
are
insoluble
she
appeared
for
a
moment
to
reflect
upon
this
it
was
spoken
in
a
tone
that
might
have
touched
her
yet
at
the
end
of
the
moment
lifting
her
eyes
she
brought
out
i
hate
art
as
you
call
it
i
thought
i
did
i
knew
i
did
but
till
this
morning
i
did
know
how
much
bless
your
dear
soul
was
art
nick
pleaded
the
real
thing
will
be
a
thousand
miles
away
from
us
it
will
never
come
into
the
house
it
knows
where
to
look
in
and
where
to
flee
shrieking
why
then
should
you
worry
because
i
want
to
understand
i
want
to
know
what
i
doing
you
an
artist
you
are
you
are
julia
cried
accusing
him
passionately
my
poor
julia
it
is
so
easy
as
that
nor
a
character
one
can
take
on
from
one
day
to
the
other
there
are
all
sorts
of
things
one
must
be
caught
young
and
put
through
the
mill
one
must
see
things
as
they
are
there
are
very
few
professions
that
goes
with
there
would
be
sacrifices
i
never
can
make
well
then
there
are
sacrifices
for
both
of
us
and
i
ca
make
them
either
i
daresay
it
all
right
for
you
but
for
me
it
would
be
a
terrible
mistake
when
i
think
i
doing
a
certain
thing
i
must
do
just
the
opposite
she
kept
on
as
for
true
lucidity
there
are
things
i
thought
of
the
things
i
like
best
and
they
not
what
you
mean
it
would
be
a
great
deception
and
it
not
the
way
i
see
my
life
and
it
would
be
misery
if
we
do
understand
he
looked
at
her
with
eyes
not
lighted
by
her
words
if
we
understand
what
that
we
utterly
different
that
you
doing
it
all
for
and
is
that
an
objection
to
me
what
i
do
for
you
he
asked
you
do
too
much
you
awfully
good
you
generous
you
a
dear
oh
yes
a
dear
but
that
does
make
me
believe
in
it
i
did
at
bottom
from
the
first
that
why
i
made
you
wait
why
i
gave
you
your
freedom
oh
i
suspected
you
julia
continued
i
had
my
ideas
all
right
for
you
but
it
wo
do
for
me
i
different
altogether
why
should
it
always
be
put
upon
me
when
i
hate
it
what
have
i
done
i
was
drenched
with
it
before
these
last
words
as
they
broke
forth
were
attended
with
a
quick
blush
so
that
nick
could
as
quickly
discern
in
them
the
uncalculated
betrayal
of
an
old
irritation
an
old
shame
almost
her
late
husband
flat
inglorious
taste
for
pretty
things
his
indifference
to
every
chance
to
play
a
public
part
this
had
been
the
humiliation
of
her
youth
and
it
was
indeed
a
perversity
of
fate
that
a
new
alliance
should
contain
for
her
even
an
oblique
demand
for
the
same
spirit
of
accommodation
impose
on
her
the
secret
bitterness
of
the
same
concessions
as
nick
stood
there
before
her
struggling
sincerely
with
the
force
that
he
now
felt
to
be
strong
in
her
the
intense
resolution
to
break
with
him
a
force
matured
in
a
few
hours
he
read
a
riddle
that
hitherto
had
baffled
him
saw
a
great
mystery
become
simple
a
personal
passion
for
him
had
all
but
thrown
her
into
his
arms
the
sort
of
thing
that
even
a
vain
man
and
nick
was
not
especially
vain
might
hesitate
to
recognise
the
strength
of
held
in
check
at
moments
with
a
strain
of
the
cord
that
he
could
still
feel
vibrate
by
her
deep
her
rare
ambition
and
arrested
at
the
last
only
just
in
time
to
save
her
calculations
his
present
glimpse
of
the
immense
extent
of
these
calculations
did
make
him
think
her
cold
or
poor
there
was
in
fact
a
positive
strange
heat
in
them
and
they
struck
him
rather
as
grand
and
high
the
fact
that
she
could
drop
him
even
while
she
longed
for
him
drop
him
because
it
was
now
fixed
in
her
mind
that
he
after
all
serve
her
resolve
to
be
associated
so
far
as
a
woman
could
with
great
affairs
that
she
could
postpone
and
postpone
to
an
uncertainty
the
satisfaction
of
an
aching
tenderness
and
plan
for
the
long
run
this
exhibition
of
will
and
courage
of
the
larger
scheme
that
possessed
her
commanded
his
admiration
on
the
spot
he
paid
the
heavy
price
of
the
man
of
imagination
he
was
capable
of
far
excursions
of
the
spirit
disloyalties
to
habit
and
even
to
faith
he
was
open
to
rare
communications
he
ached
on
his
side
for
the
moment
to
convince
her
that
he
would
achieve
what
he
would
for
the
vision
of
his
future
she
had
tried
to
entertain
shone
before
him
as
a
bribe
and
a
challenge
it
struck
him
there
was
nothing
he
could
work
for
enough
with
her
to
be
so
worked
with
by
her
presently
he
said
you
want
to
be
sure
the
man
you
marry
will
be
prime
minister
of
england
but
how
can
you
be
really
sure
with
any
one
i
can
be
really
sure
some
men
wo
julia
returned
the
only
safe
thing
perhaps
would
be
macgeorge
he
suggested
possibly
not
even
him
you
a
prime
minister
yourself
nick
made
answer
to
hold
fast
to
you
as
i
hold
to
be
determined
to
be
of
your
party
is
that
political
enough
since
you
the
incarnation
of
politics
ah
how
you
hate
them
she
wailed
again
i
saw
that
when
i
saw
you
this
morning
the
whole
place
reeked
of
your
aversion
my
dear
child
the
greatest
statesmen
have
had
their
distractions
what
do
you
make
of
my
hereditary
talent
that
a
tremendous
force
it
would
carry
you
far
then
she
terribly
added
you
must
be
a
great
artist
he
tossed
his
head
at
the
involuntary
contempt
of
this
but
she
went
on
it
beautiful
of
you
to
want
to
give
up
anything
and
i
like
you
for
it
i
shall
always
like
you
we
shall
be
friends
and
i
shall
always
take
an
interest
but
he
stopped
her
there
made
a
movement
which
interrupted
her
phrase
and
she
suffered
him
to
hold
her
hand
as
if
she
were
not
afraid
of
him
now
it
is
only
for
you
he
argued
gently
you
a
great
deal
but
you
not
everything
innumerable
vows
and
pledges
repose
upon
my
head
i
inextricably
committed
and
dedicated
i
was
brought
up
in
the
temple
like
an
infant
samuel
my
father
was
a
and
i
a
child
of
the
lord
and
then
the
life
itself
when
speak
of
it
i
feel
stirred
to
my
depths
it
like
a
herald
trumpet
fight
me
julia
not
against
me
be
on
my
side
and
we
shall
do
everything
it
is
uplifting
to
be
a
great
man
before
the
people
to
be
loved
by
them
to
be
followed
by
them
an
artist
is
never
never
why
he
be
do
forget
how
clever
i
am
oh
if
it
was
for
that
she
panted
pale
with
the
effort
to
resist
his
tone
then
she
put
it
to
him
do
you
pretend
that
if
i
were
to
die
you
stay
in
the
house
if
you
were
to
die
god
knows
but
you
do
singularly
little
justice
to
my
incentives
he
pursued
my
political
career
everything
to
my
mother
this
but
made
her
say
after
a
moment
are
you
afraid
of
your
mother
yes
immensely
for
she
represents
ever
so
many
possibilities
of
disappointment
and
distress
she
represents
all
my
father
as
well
as
all
her
own
and
in
them
my
father
tragically
lives
again
on
the
other
hand
i
see
him
in
bliss
as
i
see
my
mother
over
our
marriage
and
our
life
of
common
aspirations
though
of
course
that
not
a
consideration
that
i
can
expect
to
have
power
with
you
she
shook
her
head
slowly
even
smiling
with
her
recovered
calmness
and
lucidity
you
never
hold
high
office
but
why
not
take
me
as
i
am
because
i
abominably
keen
about
that
sort
of
thing
i
must
recognise
my
keenness
i
must
face
the
ugly
truth
i
been
through
the
worst
it
all
settled
the
worst
i
suppose
was
when
you
found
me
this
morning
oh
that
was
all
right
for
you
you
magnanimous
julia
but
evidently
what
good
enough
for
me
is
good
enough
for
you
nick
spoke
with
bitterness
i
do
like
you
enough
that
the
obstacle
she
held
herself
in
hand
to
say
you
did
a
year
ago
you
confessed
to
it
well
a
year
ago
was
a
year
ago
things
are
changed
you
very
fortunate
to
be
able
to
throw
away
a
real
devotion
nick
returned
she
had
her
in
her
hand
and
at
this
she
quickly
pressed
it
to
her
lips
as
to
check
an
exclamation
then
for
an
instant
she
appeared
to
be
listening
to
some
sound
from
outside
he
interpreted
her
movement
as
an
honourable
impulse
to
repress
the
do
you
mean
the
devotion
i
was
witness
of
this
morning
but
immediately
afterwards
she
said
something
very
different
i
thought
i
heard
a
ring
telegraphed
for
mrs
gresham
he
wondered
why
did
you
do
that
oh
i
want
her
he
walked
to
the
window
where
the
curtains
had
not
been
drawn
and
saw
in
the
dusk
a
cab
at
the
door
when
he
turned
back
he
went
on
why
wo
you
trust
me
to
make
you
like
me
as
you
call
it
better
if
i
make
you
like
me
as
well
as
i
like
you
it
will
be
about
enough
i
think
oh
i
like
you
enough
for
happiness
and
i
do
throw
away
a
devotion
dallow
continued
i
shall
be
constantly
kind
to
you
i
shall
be
beautiful
to
you
you
make
me
lose
a
fortune
nick
after
a
moment
said
it
brought
a
slight
convulsion
instantly
repressed
into
her
face
ah
you
may
have
all
the
money
you
want
i
do
mean
yours
he
answered
with
plenty
of
expression
of
his
own
he
had
determined
on
the
instant
since
it
might
serve
to
tell
her
what
he
had
never
breathed
to
her
before
carteret
last
year
promised
me
a
pot
of
money
on
the
day
we
should
be
man
and
wife
he
has
thoroughly
set
his
heart
on
it
i
sorry
to
disappoint
carteret
said
julia
i
go
and
see
him
i
make
it
all
right
she
went
on
then
your
work
you
know
will
bring
you
an
income
the
great
men
get
a
thousand
just
for
a
head
i
only
joking
nick
returned
with
sombre
eyes
that
contradicted
this
profession
but
what
things
you
deserve
i
should
do
do
you
mean
striking
likenesses
he
watched
her
a
moment
you
do
hate
it
pushed
to
that
point
curious
he
audibly
mused
do
you
mean
you
joking
about
carteret
promise
no
the
promise
is
real
but
i
do
seriously
offer
it
as
a
reason
i
shall
go
to
beauclere
julia
said
you
an
hour
late
she
added
in
a
different
tone
for
at
that
moment
the
door
of
the
room
was
thrown
open
and
gresham
the
butler
pronouncing
her
name
ushered
in
ah
do
impugn
my
punctuality
it
my
character
the
useful
lady
protested
putting
a
sixpence
from
the
cabman
into
her
purse
nick
went
off
at
this
with
a
simplified
farewell
went
off
foreseeing
exactly
what
he
found
the
next
day
that
the
useful
lady
would
have
received
orders
not
to
budge
from
her
hostess
side
he
called
on
the
morrow
late
in
the
afternoon
and
julia
saw
him
liberally
in
the
spirit
of
her
assurance
that
she
would
be
beautiful
to
him
that
she
had
not
thrown
away
his
devotion
but
gresham
remained
with
whatever
delicacies
of
deprecation
a
spectator
of
her
liberality
julia
looked
at
him
kindly
but
her
companion
was
more
benignant
still
so
that
what
nick
did
with
his
own
eyes
was
not
to
appeal
to
her
to
see
him
a
moment
alone
but
to
solicit
in
the
name
of
this
luxury
the
second
occupant
of
the
gresham
seemed
to
say
while
julia
said
so
little
i
understand
my
poor
friend
i
know
everything
she
has
told
me
only
side
but
i
so
competent
that
i
know
yours
too
and
i
enter
into
the
whole
thing
deeply
but
it
would
be
as
much
as
my
place
is
worth
to
accommodate
you
still
she
did
go
so
far
as
to
give
him
an
inkling
of
what
he
learned
on
the
third
day
and
what
he
had
not
gone
so
far
as
to
suspect
that
the
two
ladies
had
made
rapid
arrangements
for
a
scheme
of
foreign
travel
these
arrangements
had
already
been
carried
out
when
at
the
door
of
the
house
in
great
stanhope
street
the
announcement
was
made
him
that
the
subtle
creatures
had
started
that
morning
for
paris
xxviii
they
spent
on
their
way
to
florence
several
days
in
paris
where
peter
sherringham
had
as
much
free
talk
with
his
sister
as
it
often
befell
one
member
of
their
family
to
have
with
another
he
enjoyed
that
is
on
two
different
occasions
half
an
hour
gossip
with
her
in
her
at
the
hotel
on
one
of
these
he
took
the
liberty
of
asking
her
whether
or
no
decidedly
she
meant
to
marry
nick
dormer
julia
expressed
to
him
that
she
appreciated
his
curiosity
but
that
nick
and
she
were
nothing
more
than
relations
and
good
friends
he
tremendously
wants
it
peter
none
the
less
observed
to
which
she
simply
made
answer
well
then
he
may
want
after
this
for
a
while
they
sat
as
silent
as
if
the
subject
had
been
quite
threshed
out
between
them
peter
felt
no
impulse
to
penetrate
further
for
it
was
not
a
habit
of
the
sherringhams
to
talk
with
each
other
of
their
and
he
was
conscious
of
the
particular
deterrent
that
he
and
julia
entertained
in
general
such
different
sentiments
that
they
could
never
go
far
together
in
discussion
he
liked
her
and
was
sorry
for
her
thought
her
life
lonely
and
wondered
she
did
make
a
great
marriage
moreover
he
pitied
her
for
being
without
the
interests
and
consolations
he
himself
had
found
substantial
those
of
the
intellectual
the
studious
order
he
considered
these
to
be
not
knowing
how
much
she
supposed
she
reflected
and
studied
and
what
an
education
she
had
found
in
her
political
aspirations
viewed
by
him
as
scarce
more
a
personal
part
of
her
than
the
livery
of
her
servants
or
the
jewels
george
dallow
money
had
bought
her
relations
with
nick
struck
him
as
queer
but
were
fortunately
none
of
his
business
no
business
of
julia
was
sufficiently
his
to
justify
him
in
an
attempt
to
understand
it
that
there
should
have
been
a
question
of
her
marrying
nick
was
the
funny
thing
rather
than
that
the
question
should
have
been
dropped
he
liked
his
clever
cousin
very
well
as
he
was
enough
for
a
vague
sense
that
he
might
be
spoiled
by
alteration
to
a
moreover
though
not
perhaps
distinctly
conscious
of
this
peter
pressed
lightly
on
julia
doings
from
a
tacit
understanding
that
in
this
case
she
would
let
him
off
as
easily
he
could
have
said
exactly
what
it
was
he
judged
it
pertinent
to
be
let
off
from
perhaps
from
irritating
inquiry
as
to
whether
he
had
given
any
more
for
gross
young
women
connected
with
the
theatre
peter
forbearance
however
brought
him
not
quite
all
the
security
he
prefigured
after
an
interval
he
indeed
went
so
far
as
to
ask
julia
if
nick
had
been
wanting
in
respect
to
her
but
this
was
an
appeal
intended
for
sympathy
not
for
other
intervention
she
answered
dear
no
though
he
very
provoking
thus
peter
guessed
that
they
had
had
a
quarrel
in
which
it
did
concern
him
to
meddle
he
added
her
epithet
and
her
flight
from
england
together
and
they
made
up
to
his
perception
one
of
the
little
magnified
embroilments
which
do
duty
for
the
real
in
superficial
lives
it
was
worse
to
provoke
julia
than
not
and
peter
thought
nick
doing
so
not
particularly
characteristic
of
his
versatility
for
good
he
might
wonder
why
she
did
marry
the
member
for
harsh
if
the
subject
had
pressingly
come
up
between
them
but
he
wondered
still
more
why
nick
did
marry
that
gentleman
great
backer
julia
said
nothing
again
as
if
to
give
him
a
chance
to
address
her
some
challenge
that
would
save
her
from
gushing
but
as
his
impulse
appeared
to
be
to
change
the
subject
and
as
he
changed
it
only
by
silence
she
was
reduced
to
resuming
presently
i
should
have
thought
you
have
come
over
to
see
your
friend
the
actress
which
of
my
friends
i
know
so
many
actresses
peter
pleaded
the
woman
you
inflicted
on
us
in
this
place
a
year
ago
the
one
in
london
now
oh
miriam
rooth
i
should
have
liked
to
come
over
but
i
been
tied
fast
have
you
seen
her
there
yes
i
seen
her
do
you
like
her
not
at
all
she
has
a
lovely
voice
peter
hazarded
after
a
moment
i
do
know
anything
about
her
voice
i
have
heard
it
but
she
does
act
in
pantomime
does
she
i
do
know
anything
about
her
acting
i
saw
her
in
private
at
nick
dormer
studio
at
nick
he
was
interested
now
what
was
she
doing
there
she
was
sprawling
over
the
room
and
rather
insolently
staring
at
me
if
dallow
had
wished
to
draw
her
brother
she
must
at
this
point
have
suspected
she
succeeded
in
spite
of
his
care
to
divest
his
tone
of
all
emotion
why
does
he
know
her
so
well
i
did
know
she
sitting
to
him
for
her
portrait
at
least
she
was
then
oh
yes
i
remember
i
put
him
up
to
that
i
greatly
interested
is
the
portrait
good
i
have
the
least
idea
i
did
look
at
it
i
daresay
it
like
julia
threw
off
but
how
in
the
world
and
peter
interest
grew
franker
does
nick
find
time
to
paint
i
do
know
that
horrid
man
brought
her
which
horrid
man
he
spoke
as
if
they
had
their
choice
the
one
nick
thinks
so
clever
the
vulgar
little
man
who
was
at
your
place
that
day
and
tried
to
talk
to
me
i
remember
he
abused
theatrical
people
to
me
as
if
i
cared
anything
about
them
but
he
has
apparently
something
to
do
with
your
girl
oh
i
recollect
him
i
had
a
discussion
with
him
peter
patiently
said
how
could
you
i
must
go
and
dress
his
sister
went
on
more
importantly
he
clever
remarkably
miss
rooth
and
her
mother
were
old
friends
of
his
and
he
was
the
first
person
to
speak
of
them
to
me
what
a
distinction
i
thought
him
disgusting
cried
julia
who
was
pressed
for
time
and
who
had
now
got
up
oh
you
severe
said
peter
still
bland
but
when
they
separated
she
had
given
him
something
to
think
of
that
nick
was
painting
a
beautiful
actress
was
no
doubt
in
part
at
least
the
reason
why
he
was
provoking
and
why
his
most
intimate
female
friend
had
come
abroad
the
fact
did
render
him
provoking
to
his
kinsman
peter
had
on
the
contrary
been
quite
sincere
when
he
qualified
it
as
interesting
it
became
indeed
on
reflexion
so
interesting
that
it
had
perhaps
almost
as
much
to
do
with
sherringham
now
prompt
rush
over
to
london
as
it
had
to
do
with
julia
coming
away
reflexion
taught
him
further
that
the
matter
was
altogether
a
delicate
one
and
suggested
that
it
was
odd
he
should
be
mixed
up
with
it
in
fact
when
as
julia
own
affair
he
had
but
wished
to
keep
out
of
it
it
might
after
all
be
his
affair
a
little
as
well
there
was
somehow
a
still
more
pointed
implication
of
that
in
his
sister
saying
to
him
the
next
day
that
she
wished
immensely
he
would
take
a
fancy
to
biddy
dormer
she
said
more
she
said
there
had
been
a
time
when
she
believed
he
done
so
believed
too
that
the
poor
child
herself
had
believed
the
same
biddy
was
far
away
the
nicest
girl
she
knew
the
dearest
sweetest
cleverest
and
one
of
the
prettiest
creatures
in
england
which
never
spoiled
anything
she
would
make
as
charming
a
wife
as
ever
a
man
had
suited
to
any
position
however
high
and
julia
did
mind
mentioning
it
since
her
brother
would
believe
it
whether
she
mentioned
it
or
no
was
so
predisposed
in
his
favour
that
he
would
have
no
trouble
at
all
in
short
she
herself
would
see
him
through
she
answer
for
it
that
he
have
but
to
speak
biddy
life
at
home
was
horrid
she
was
very
sorry
for
her
the
child
was
worthy
of
a
better
fate
peter
wondered
what
constituted
the
horridness
of
biddy
life
and
gathered
that
it
mainly
arose
from
the
fact
of
julia
disliking
lady
agnes
and
grace
and
of
her
profiting
comfortably
by
that
freedom
to
do
so
which
was
a
fruit
of
her
having
given
them
a
house
she
had
perhaps
not
felt
the
want
of
till
they
were
in
possession
of
it
he
knew
she
had
always
liked
biddy
but
he
asked
himself
this
was
the
rest
of
his
wonder
why
she
had
taken
to
liking
her
so
extraordinarily
just
now
he
liked
her
himself
he
even
liked
to
be
talked
to
about
her
and
could
believe
everything
julia
said
the
only
thing
that
had
mystified
him
was
her
motive
for
suddenly
saying
it
he
had
assured
her
he
was
perfectly
sensible
of
her
goodness
in
so
plotting
out
his
future
but
was
also
sorry
if
he
had
put
it
into
any
one
head
most
of
all
into
the
own
that
he
had
ever
looked
at
biddy
with
a
covetous
eye
he
was
in
the
least
sure
she
would
make
a
good
wife
but
liked
her
quite
too
much
to
wish
to
put
any
such
mystery
to
the
test
she
was
certainly
not
offered
them
for
cruel
experiments
as
it
happened
really
he
thinking
of
marrying
any
one
he
had
ever
so
many
grounds
for
neglecting
that
of
course
one
was
never
safe
against
accidents
but
one
could
at
least
take
precautions
and
he
did
mind
telling
her
that
there
were
several
he
had
taken
i
do
know
what
you
mean
but
it
seems
to
me
quite
the
best
precaution
would
be
to
care
for
a
charming
steady
girl
like
biddy
then
you
be
quite
in
shelter
you
know
the
worst
that
can
happen
to
you
and
it
would
be
bad
the
objection
he
had
made
to
this
plea
is
not
important
especially
as
it
was
not
quite
candid
it
need
only
be
mentioned
that
before
the
pair
parted
julia
said
to
him
still
in
reference
to
their
young
friend
do
go
and
see
her
and
be
nice
to
her
she
save
you
disappointments
these
last
words
reverberated
for
him
there
was
a
shade
of
the
portentous
in
them
and
they
seemed
to
proceed
from
a
larger
knowledge
of
the
subject
than
he
himself
as
yet
possessed
they
were
not
absent
from
his
memory
when
in
the
beginning
of
may
availing
himself
to
save
time
of
the
he
crossed
from
paris
to
london
he
arrived
before
the
and
went
to
his
sister
house
in
great
stanhope
street
where
he
always
found
quarters
were
she
in
town
or
not
when
at
home
she
welcomed
him
and
in
her
absence
the
relaxed
servants
hailed
him
for
the
chance
he
gave
them
to
recover
their
form
in
either
case
his
allowance
of
space
was
large
and
his
independence
complete
he
had
obtained
permission
this
year
to
take
in
scattered
snatches
rather
than
as
a
single
draught
the
quantum
of
holiday
to
which
he
was
entitled
and
there
was
moreover
a
question
of
his
being
transferred
to
another
capital
in
which
event
he
believed
he
might
count
on
a
month
or
two
in
england
before
proceeding
to
his
new
post
he
waited
after
breakfast
but
a
very
few
minutes
before
jumping
into
a
hansom
and
rattling
away
to
the
north
a
part
of
his
waiting
indeed
consisted
of
a
fidgety
walk
up
bond
street
during
which
he
looked
at
his
watch
three
or
four
times
while
he
paused
at
shop
windows
for
fear
of
being
a
little
early
in
the
cab
as
he
rolled
along
after
having
given
an
address
balaklava
place
saint
john
wood
the
fear
he
might
be
too
early
took
curiously
at
moments
the
form
of
a
fear
that
he
should
be
too
late
a
symbol
of
the
inconsistencies
of
which
his
spirit
at
present
was
full
peter
sherringham
was
nervously
formed
too
nervously
for
a
diplomatist
and
haunted
with
inclinations
and
indeed
with
designs
which
contradicted
each
other
he
wanted
to
be
out
of
it
and
yet
dreaded
not
to
be
in
it
and
on
this
particular
occasion
the
sense
of
exclusion
was
an
ache
at
the
same
time
he
was
not
unconscious
of
the
impulse
to
stop
his
cab
and
make
it
turn
round
and
drive
due
south
he
saw
himself
launched
in
the
breezy
fact
while
morally
speaking
he
was
hauled
up
on
the
hot
sand
of
the
principle
and
he
could
easily
note
how
little
these
two
faces
of
the
same
idea
had
in
common
however
as
the
consciousness
of
going
helped
him
to
reflect
a
principle
was
a
poor
affair
if
it
merely
became
a
fact
yet
from
the
hour
it
did
turn
to
action
the
action
to
be
the
particular
one
in
which
he
was
engaged
so
that
he
was
in
the
absurd
position
of
thinking
his
conduct
wiser
for
the
reason
that
it
was
directly
opposed
to
his
intentions
he
had
kept
away
from
london
ever
since
miriam
rooth
came
over
resisting
curiosity
sympathy
importunate
haunting
passion
and
considering
that
his
resistance
founded
to
be
salutary
on
a
general
scheme
of
life
was
the
greatest
success
he
had
yet
achieved
he
was
deeply
occupied
with
plucking
up
the
feeling
that
attached
him
to
her
and
he
had
already
by
various
little
ingenuities
loosened
some
of
its
roots
he
had
suffered
her
to
make
her
first
appearance
on
any
stage
without
the
comfort
of
his
voice
or
the
applause
of
his
hand
saying
to
himself
that
the
man
who
could
do
the
more
could
do
the
less
and
that
such
an
act
of
fortitude
was
a
proof
he
should
keep
straight
it
was
not
exactly
keeping
straight
to
run
over
to
london
three
months
later
and
the
hour
he
arrived
scramble
off
to
balaklava
place
but
after
all
he
pretended
only
to
be
human
and
aimed
in
behaviour
only
at
the
heroic
never
at
the
monstrous
the
highest
heroism
was
obviously
three
parts
tact
he
had
not
written
to
his
young
friend
that
he
was
coming
to
england
and
would
call
upon
her
at
eleven
in
the
morning
because
it
was
his
secret
pride
that
he
had
ceased
to
correspond
with
her
sherringham
took
his
prudence
where
he
could
find
it
and
in
doing
so
was
rather
like
a
drunkard
who
should
flatter
himself
he
had
forsworn
liquor
since
he
did
touch
lemonade
it
is
a
sign
of
how
far
he
was
drawn
in
different
directions
at
once
that
when
on
reaching
balaklava
place
and
alighting
at
the
door
of
a
small
detached
villa
of
the
type
of
the
retreat
he
learned
that
miss
rooth
had
but
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
quitted
the
spot
with
her
mother
they
had
gone
to
the
theatre
to
rehearsal
said
the
maid
who
answered
the
bell
he
had
set
tinkling
behind
a
stuccoed
when
at
the
end
of
his
pilgrimage
he
was
greeted
by
a
disappointment
he
suddenly
found
himself
relieved
and
for
the
moment
even
saved
providence
was
after
all
taking
care
of
him
and
he
submitted
to
providence
he
would
still
be
watched
over
doubtless
even
should
he
follow
the
two
ladies
to
the
theatre
send
in
his
card
and
obtain
admission
to
the
scene
of
their
experiments
all
his
keen
taste
for
these
matters
flamed
up
again
and
he
wondered
what
the
girl
was
studying
was
rehearsing
what
she
was
to
do
next
he
got
back
into
his
hansom
and
drove
down
the
edgware
road
by
the
time
he
reached
the
marble
arch
he
had
changed
his
mind
again
had
determined
to
let
miriam
alone
for
that
day
it
would
be
over
at
eight
in
the
evening
he
hardly
played
fair
and
then
he
should
consider
himself
free
instead
of
pursuing
his
friends
he
directed
himself
upon
a
shop
in
bond
street
to
take
a
place
for
their
performance
on
first
coming
out
he
had
tried
at
one
of
those
establishments
strangely
denominated
libraries
to
get
a
stall
but
the
people
to
whom
he
applied
were
unable
to
accommodate
him
they
had
a
single
seat
left
his
actual
attempt
at
another
library
was
more
successful
there
was
no
question
of
obtaining
a
stall
but
he
might
by
a
miracle
still
have
a
box
there
was
a
wantonness
in
paying
for
a
box
at
a
play
on
which
he
had
already
expended
four
hundred
pounds
but
while
he
was
mentally
measuring
this
abyss
an
idea
came
into
his
head
which
flushed
the
extravagance
with
the
hue
of
persuasion
peter
came
out
of
the
shop
with
the
voucher
for
the
box
in
his
pocket
turned
into
piccadilly
noted
that
the
day
was
growing
warm
and
fine
felt
glad
that
this
time
he
had
no
other
strict
business
than
to
leave
a
card
or
two
on
official
people
and
asked
himself
where
he
should
go
if
he
did
go
after
miriam
then
it
was
that
he
found
himself
attaching
a
lively
desire
and
imputing
a
high
importance
to
the
possible
view
of
nick
dormer
portrait
of
her
he
wondered
which
would
be
the
natural
place
at
that
hour
of
the
day
to
look
for
the
artist
the
house
of
commons
was
perhaps
the
nearest
one
but
nick
inconsequent
and
incalculable
though
so
many
of
his
steps
probably
did
keep
the
picture
there
and
moreover
it
was
not
generally
characteristic
of
him
to
be
in
the
natural
place
the
end
of
peter
debate
was
that
he
again
entered
a
hansom
and
drove
to
calcutta
gardens
the
hour
was
early
for
calling
but
cousins
with
whom
one
intercourse
was
mainly
a
conversational
scuffle
would
accept
it
as
a
practical
illustration
of
that
method
and
if
julia
wanted
him
to
be
nice
to
biddy
which
was
exactly
even
if
with
a
different
view
what
he
wanted
himself
how
could
he
better
testify
than
by
a
visit
to
lady
agnes
he
would
have
in
decency
to
go
to
see
her
some
time
at
a
friendly
fraternising
hour
when
they
would
all
be
likely
to
be
at
home
unfortunately
as
it
turned
out
they
were
none
of
them
at
home
so
that
he
had
to
fall
back
on
neutrality
and
the
butler
who
was
however
more
luckily
an
old
friend
her
ladyship
and
miss
dormer
were
absent
from
town
paying
a
visit
and
dormer
was
also
away
or
was
on
the
point
of
going
away
for
the
day
miss
bridget
was
in
london
but
was
out
peter
informant
mentioned
with
earnest
vagueness
that
he
thought
she
had
gone
somewhere
to
take
a
lesson
on
peter
asking
what
sort
of
lesson
he
meant
he
replied
oh
i
think
a
the
you
know
sir
peter
knew
but
biddy
lesson
in
it
sounded
on
the
butler
lips
like
a
fashionable
new
art
struck
him
a
little
as
a
mockery
of
the
helpful
spirit
in
which
he
had
come
to
look
her
up
the
man
had
an
air
of
participating
respectfully
in
his
disappointment
and
to
make
up
for
it
added
that
he
might
perhaps
find
dormer
at
his
other
address
he
had
gone
out
early
and
had
directed
his
servant
to
come
to
rosedale
road
in
an
hour
or
two
with
a
portmanteau
he
was
going
down
to
beauclere
in
the
course
of
the
day
carteret
being
ill
perhaps
sherringham
did
know
it
perhaps
too
sherringham
would
catch
him
in
rosedale
road
before
he
took
his
train
he
was
to
have
been
busy
there
for
an
hour
this
was
worth
trying
and
peter
immediately
drove
to
rosedale
road
where
in
answer
to
his
ring
the
door
was
opened
to
him
by
biddy
dormer
xxix
when
that
young
woman
saw
him
her
cheek
exhibited
the
prettiest
pleased
surprised
red
he
had
ever
observed
there
though
far
from
unacquainted
with
its
living
tides
and
she
stood
smiling
at
him
with
the
outer
dazzle
in
her
eyes
still
making
him
no
motion
to
enter
she
only
said
oh
peter
and
then
i
all
alone
so
much
the
better
dear
biddy
is
that
any
reason
i
should
come
in
dear
no
do
come
in
you
just
missed
nick
he
has
gone
to
the
country
half
an
hour
ago
she
had
on
a
large
apron
and
in
her
hand
carried
a
small
stick
besmeared
as
his
quick
eye
saw
with
she
dropped
the
door
and
fled
back
before
him
into
the
studio
where
when
he
followed
her
she
was
in
the
act
of
flinging
a
damp
cloth
over
a
rough
head
in
clay
which
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
supported
on
a
high
wooden
stand
the
effort
to
hide
what
she
had
been
doing
before
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
it
made
her
redder
still
and
led
to
her
smiling
more
to
her
laughing
with
a
confusion
of
shyness
and
gladness
that
charmed
him
she
rubbed
her
hands
on
her
apron
she
pulled
it
off
she
looked
delightfully
awkward
not
meeting
peter
eye
and
she
said
i
just
scraping
here
a
little
you
must
mind
me
what
i
do
is
awful
you
know
peter
do
look
i
been
coming
here
lately
to
make
my
little
mess
because
mamma
does
particularly
like
it
at
home
i
had
a
lesson
or
two
from
a
lady
who
exhibits
but
you
would
suppose
it
to
see
what
i
do
nick
so
kind
he
lets
me
come
here
he
uses
the
studio
so
little
i
do
what
i
want
or
rather
what
i
can
what
a
pity
he
gone
he
have
been
so
glad
i
really
alone
i
hope
you
do
mind
peter
do
look
peter
was
not
bent
on
looking
his
eyes
had
occupation
enough
in
own
agreeable
aspect
which
was
full
of
a
rare
element
of
domestication
and
responsibility
though
she
had
stretching
her
bravery
taken
possession
of
her
brother
quarters
she
struck
her
visitor
as
more
at
home
and
more
herself
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
been
to
his
notice
so
separate
from
her
mother
and
sister
she
seemed
to
know
this
herself
and
to
be
a
little
frightened
by
it
just
enough
to
make
him
wish
to
be
reassuring
at
the
same
time
peter
also
on
this
occasion
found
himself
touched
with
diffidence
especially
after
he
had
gone
back
and
closed
the
door
and
settled
down
to
a
regular
call
for
he
became
acutely
conscious
of
what
julia
had
said
to
him
in
paris
and
was
unable
to
rid
himself
of
the
suspicion
that
it
had
been
said
with
biddy
knowledge
it
was
that
he
supposed
his
sister
had
told
the
girl
she
meant
to
do
what
she
could
to
make
him
propose
to
her
that
would
have
been
cruel
to
her
if
she
liked
him
enough
to
consent
in
julia
perfect
uncertainty
but
biddy
participated
by
imagination
by
divination
by
a
clever
girl
secret
tremulous
instincts
in
her
good
friend
views
about
her
and
this
probability
constituted
for
sherringham
a
sort
of
embarrassing
publicity
he
had
impressions
possibly
gross
and
unjust
in
regard
to
the
way
women
move
constantly
together
amid
such
considerations
and
subtly
intercommunicate
when
they
do
still
more
subtly
dissemble
the
hopes
or
fears
of
which
persons
of
the
opposite
sex
form
the
subject
therefore
poor
biddy
would
know
that
if
she
failed
to
strike
him
in
the
right
light
it
would
be
for
want
of
an
attention
definitely
called
to
her
claims
she
would
have
been
tacitly
rejected
virtually
condemned
he
could
without
an
impulse
of
fatuity
endeavour
to
make
up
for
this
to
her
by
consoling
kindness
he
was
aware
that
if
any
one
knew
it
a
man
would
be
ridiculous
who
should
take
so
much
as
that
for
granted
but
no
one
would
know
it
he
oddly
enough
in
this
calculation
of
security
left
biddy
herself
out
it
did
occur
to
him
that
she
might
have
a
secret
small
irony
to
spare
for
his
ingenious
and
magnanimous
effort
to
show
her
how
much
he
liked
her
in
reparation
to
her
for
not
liking
her
more
this
high
charity
coloured
at
any
rate
the
whole
of
his
visit
to
rosedale
road
the
whole
of
the
pleasant
prolonged
chat
that
kept
him
there
more
than
an
hour
he
begged
the
girl
to
go
on
with
her
work
not
to
let
him
interrupt
it
and
she
obliged
him
at
last
taking
the
cloth
off
the
lump
of
clay
and
giving
him
a
chance
to
be
delightful
by
guessing
that
the
shapeless
mass
was
intended
or
would
be
intended
after
a
while
for
nick
he
saw
she
was
more
comfortable
when
she
began
again
to
smooth
it
and
scrape
it
with
her
little
stick
to
manipulate
it
with
an
ineffectual
air
of
knowing
how
for
this
gave
her
something
to
do
relieved
her
nervousness
and
permitted
her
to
turn
away
from
him
when
she
talked
he
walked
about
the
room
and
sat
down
got
up
and
looked
at
things
watched
her
at
moments
in
silence
which
made
her
always
say
in
a
minute
that
he
was
not
to
pass
judgement
or
she
could
do
nothing
observed
how
her
position
before
her
high
stand
her
lifted
arms
her
turns
of
the
head
considering
her
work
this
way
and
that
all
helped
her
to
be
pretty
she
repeated
again
and
again
that
it
was
an
immense
pity
about
nick
till
he
was
obliged
to
say
he
did
care
a
straw
for
nick
and
was
perfectly
content
with
the
company
he
found
this
was
not
the
sort
of
tone
he
thought
it
right
given
the
conditions
to
take
but
then
even
the
circumstances
did
require
him
to
pretend
he
liked
her
less
than
he
did
after
all
she
was
his
cousin
she
would
cease
to
be
so
if
she
should
become
his
wife
but
one
advantage
of
her
not
entering
into
that
relation
was
precisely
that
she
would
remain
his
cousin
it
was
very
pleasant
to
find
a
young
bright
slim
kinswoman
all
ready
to
recognise
consanguinity
when
one
came
back
from
cousinless
foreign
lands
peter
talked
about
family
matters
he
did
know
in
his
exile
where
no
one
took
an
interest
in
them
what
a
fund
of
latent
curiosity
about
them
he
treasured
it
drew
him
on
to
gossip
accordingly
and
to
feel
how
he
had
with
biddy
indefeasible
properties
in
common
ever
so
many
things
as
to
which
they
always
understand
each
other
he
smoked
a
cigarette
because
she
begged
him
people
always
smoked
in
studios
and
it
made
her
feel
so
much
more
an
artist
she
apologised
for
the
badness
of
her
work
on
the
ground
that
nick
was
so
busy
he
could
scarcely
ever
give
her
a
sitting
so
that
she
had
to
do
the
head
from
photographs
and
occasional
glimpses
they
had
hoped
to
be
able
to
put
in
an
hour
that
morning
but
news
had
suddenly
come
that
carteret
was
worse
and
nick
had
hurried
down
to
beauclere
carteret
was
very
ill
poor
old
dear
and
nick
and
he
were
immense
friends
nick
had
always
been
charming
to
him
peter
and
biddy
took
the
concerns
of
the
houses
of
dormer
and
sherringham
in
order
and
the
young
man
felt
after
a
little
as
if
they
were
as
wise
as
a
french
de
and
settling
what
was
best
for
every
one
he
heard
all
about
lady
agnes
he
showed
an
interest
in
the
detail
of
her
existence
that
he
had
not
supposed
himself
to
possess
though
indeed
biddy
threw
out
intimations
which
excited
his
curiosity
presenting
her
mother
in
a
light
that
might
call
on
his
sympathy
i
do
think
she
has
been
very
happy
or
very
pleased
of
late
the
girl
said
i
think
she
has
had
some
disappointments
poor
dear
mamma
and
grace
has
made
her
go
out
of
town
for
three
or
four
days
in
the
hope
of
a
little
change
they
gone
down
to
see
an
old
lady
lady
dunstans
who
never
comes
to
london
now
and
who
you
know
tremendously
old
was
papa
godmother
it
not
very
lively
for
grace
but
grace
is
such
a
dear
she
do
anything
for
mamma
mamma
will
go
anywhere
no
matter
at
what
risk
of
discomfort
to
see
people
she
can
talk
with
about
papa
biddy
added
in
reply
to
a
further
question
that
what
her
mother
was
disappointed
about
was
well
themselves
her
children
and
all
their
affairs
and
she
explained
that
lady
agnes
wanted
all
kinds
of
things
for
them
that
did
come
that
they
did
get
or
seem
likely
to
get
so
that
their
life
appeared
altogether
a
failure
she
wanted
a
great
deal
biddy
admitted
she
really
wanted
everything
for
she
had
thought
in
her
happier
days
that
everything
was
to
be
hers
she
loved
them
all
so
much
and
was
so
proud
too
she
could
get
over
the
thought
of
their
not
being
successful
peter
was
unwilling
to
press
at
this
point
for
he
suspected
one
of
the
things
lady
agnes
wanted
but
biddy
relieved
him
a
little
by
describing
her
as
eager
above
all
that
grace
should
get
married
that
too
unselfish
of
her
he
pronounced
not
caring
at
all
for
grace
cousin
agnes
ought
to
keep
her
near
her
always
if
grace
is
so
obliging
and
devoted
oh
mamma
would
give
up
anything
of
that
sort
for
our
good
she
sacrifice
us
that
way
biddy
protested
besides
i
the
one
to
stay
with
mamma
not
that
i
can
manage
and
look
after
her
and
do
everything
so
well
as
grace
but
you
know
i
to
said
biddy
with
a
liquid
note
in
her
voice
and
giving
her
lump
of
clay
a
little
stab
for
mendacious
emphasis
but
does
your
mother
want
the
rest
of
you
to
get
married
percival
and
nick
and
you
peter
asked
oh
she
has
given
up
percy
i
do
suppose
she
thinks
it
would
do
dear
nick
of
course
that
just
what
she
does
want
he
had
a
pause
and
you
biddy
oh
i
daresay
but
that
does
signify
i
never
shall
peter
got
up
at
this
the
tone
of
it
set
him
in
motion
and
he
took
a
turn
round
the
room
he
threw
off
something
cheap
about
her
being
too
proud
to
which
she
replied
that
that
was
the
only
thing
for
a
girl
to
be
to
get
on
what
do
you
mean
by
getting
on
and
he
stopped
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
on
the
other
side
of
the
studio
i
mean
crying
one
eyes
out
biddy
unexpectedly
exclaimed
but
she
drowned
the
effect
of
this
pathetic
paradox
in
a
laugh
of
clear
irrelevance
and
in
the
quick
declaration
of
course
it
about
nick
that
she
really
what
the
matter
with
nick
he
went
on
with
all
his
diplomacy
oh
peter
what
the
matter
with
julia
biddy
quavered
softly
back
to
him
her
eyes
suddenly
frank
and
mournful
i
daresay
you
know
what
we
all
hoped
what
we
all
supposed
from
what
they
told
us
and
now
they
wo
said
the
girl
yes
biddy
i
know
i
had
the
brightest
prospect
of
becoming
your
would
that
have
been
it
or
something
like
that
but
it
indeed
visibly
clouded
what
the
matter
with
them
may
i
have
another
cigarette
peter
came
back
to
the
wide
cushioned
bench
where
he
had
previously
lounged
this
was
the
way
they
took
up
the
subject
he
wanted
most
to
look
into
do
they
know
how
to
love
he
speculated
as
he
seated
himself
again
it
seems
a
kind
of
fatality
biddy
sighed
he
said
nothing
for
some
moments
at
the
end
of
which
he
asked
if
his
companion
were
to
be
quite
alone
during
her
mother
absence
she
replied
that
this
parent
was
very
droll
about
that
would
never
leave
her
alone
and
always
thought
something
dreadful
would
happen
to
her
she
had
therefore
arranged
that
florence
tressilian
should
come
and
stay
in
calcutta
gardens
for
the
next
few
days
to
look
after
her
and
see
she
did
no
wrong
peter
inquired
with
fulness
into
florence
identity
he
greatly
hoped
that
for
the
success
of
lady
precautions
she
was
a
flighty
young
genius
like
biddy
she
was
described
to
him
as
tremendously
nice
and
tremendously
clever
but
also
tremendously
old
and
tremendously
safe
with
the
addition
that
biddy
was
tremendously
fond
of
her
and
that
while
she
remained
in
calcutta
gardens
they
expected
to
enjoy
themselves
tremendously
she
was
to
come
that
afternoon
before
dinner
and
are
you
to
dine
at
home
said
peter
certainly
where
else
and
just
you
two
alone
do
you
call
that
enjoying
yourselves
tremendously
it
will
do
for
me
no
doubt
i
ought
in
modesty
to
speak
for
poor
florence
it
is
fair
to
her
you
ought
to
invite
some
one
to
meet
her
do
you
mean
you
peter
the
girl
asked
turning
to
him
quickly
and
with
a
look
that
vanished
the
instant
he
caught
it
try
me
i
come
like
a
shot
that
kind
said
biddy
dropping
her
hands
and
now
resting
her
eyes
on
him
gratefully
she
remained
in
this
position
as
if
under
a
charm
then
she
jerked
herself
back
to
her
work
with
the
remark
florence
will
like
that
immensely
i
delighted
to
please
florence
your
description
of
her
so
attractive
sherringham
laughed
and
when
his
companion
asked
him
if
he
minded
there
not
being
a
great
feast
because
when
her
mother
went
away
she
allowed
her
a
fixed
amount
for
that
sort
of
thing
and
as
he
might
imagine
it
was
millions
when
biddy
with
the
frankness
of
their
pleasant
kinship
touched
anxiously
on
this
economic
point
illustrating
as
peter
saw
the
lucidity
with
which
lady
agnes
had
had
in
her
old
age
to
learn
to
recognise
the
occasions
when
she
could
be
conveniently
frugal
he
answered
that
the
shortest
dinners
were
the
best
especially
when
one
was
going
to
the
theatre
that
was
his
case
and
did
biddy
think
he
might
look
to
miss
tressilian
to
go
with
them
they
have
to
dine
early
he
wanted
not
to
miss
a
moment
the
theatre
miss
tressilian
she
stared
interrupted
and
in
suspense
again
would
it
incommode
you
very
much
to
dine
say
at
and
accept
a
place
in
my
box
the
finger
of
providence
was
in
it
when
i
took
a
box
an
hour
ago
i
particularly
like
your
being
free
to
go
if
you
are
free
she
began
almost
to
rave
with
pleasure
dear
peter
how
good
you
are
they
have
it
at
any
hour
florence
will
be
so
glad
and
has
florence
seen
miss
rooth
miss
rooth
the
girl
repeated
redder
than
before
he
felt
on
the
spot
that
she
had
heard
of
the
expenditure
of
his
time
and
attention
on
that
young
lady
it
was
as
if
she
were
conscious
of
how
conscious
he
would
himself
be
in
speaking
of
her
and
there
was
a
sweetness
in
her
allowance
for
him
on
that
score
but
biddy
was
more
confused
for
him
than
he
was
for
himself
he
guessed
in
a
moment
how
much
she
had
thought
over
what
she
had
heard
this
was
indicated
by
her
saying
vaguely
no
no
i
not
seen
her
then
she
knew
she
was
answering
a
question
he
had
asked
her
and
she
went
on
we
shall
be
too
delighted
i
saw
her
perhaps
you
remember
in
your
rooms
in
paris
i
thought
her
so
wonderful
then
every
one
talking
of
her
here
but
we
do
go
to
the
theatre
much
you
know
we
do
have
boxes
offered
us
except
when
come
poor
nick
too
much
taken
up
in
the
evening
i
wanted
awfully
to
see
her
they
say
she
magnificent
i
do
know
peter
was
glad
to
be
able
honestly
to
answer
i
seen
her
you
have
seen
her
never
biddy
i
mean
on
the
stage
in
private
often
yes
he
conscientiously
added
oh
biddy
exclaimed
bending
her
face
on
nick
bust
again
she
asked
him
no
question
about
the
new
star
and
he
offered
her
no
further
information
there
were
things
in
his
mind
pulling
him
different
ways
so
that
for
some
minutes
silence
was
the
result
of
the
conflict
at
last
he
said
after
an
hesitation
caused
by
the
possibility
that
she
was
ignorant
of
the
fact
he
had
lately
elicited
from
julia
though
it
was
more
probable
she
might
have
learned
it
from
the
same
source
am
i
perhaps
indiscreet
in
alluding
to
the
circumstance
that
nick
has
been
painting
miss
rooth
portrait
you
not
indiscreet
in
alluding
to
it
to
me
because
i
know
it
then
there
no
secret
nor
mystery
about
it
biddy
just
considered
i
do
think
mamma
knows
it
you
mean
you
been
keeping
it
from
her
because
she
would
like
it
we
afraid
she
may
think
papa
would
have
liked
it
this
was
said
with
an
absence
of
humour
at
which
peter
could
but
show
amusement
though
he
quickly
recovered
himself
repenting
of
any
apparent
failure
of
respect
to
the
high
memory
of
his
late
celebrated
relative
he
threw
off
rather
vaguely
ah
yes
i
remember
that
great
man
ideas
and
then
went
on
may
i
ask
if
you
know
it
the
fact
we
talking
of
through
julia
or
through
nick
i
know
it
from
both
of
them
then
if
you
in
their
confidence
may
i
further
ask
if
this
undertaking
of
nick
is
the
reason
why
things
seem
to
be
at
an
end
between
them
oh
i
do
think
she
likes
it
biddy
had
to
say
is
it
good
oh
i
do
mean
the
picture
she
has
seen
it
but
his
having
done
it
does
she
dislike
it
so
much
that
that
why
she
wo
marry
him
biddy
gave
up
her
work
moving
away
from
it
to
look
at
it
she
came
and
sat
down
on
the
long
bench
on
which
sherringham
had
placed
himself
then
she
broke
out
oh
peter
it
a
great
trouble
it
a
very
great
trouble
and
i
ca
tell
you
for
i
do
understand
it
if
i
ask
you
he
said
it
not
to
pry
into
what
does
concern
me
but
julia
my
sister
and
i
ca
after
all
help
taking
some
interest
in
her
life
she
tells
me
herself
so
little
she
does
think
me
worthy
ah
poor
julia
biddy
wailed
defensively
her
tone
recalled
to
him
that
julia
had
at
least
thought
him
worthy
to
unite
himself
to
bridget
dormer
and
inevitably
betrayed
that
the
girl
was
thinking
of
that
also
while
they
both
thought
of
it
they
sat
looking
into
each
other
eyes
nick
i
sure
does
treat
that
way
i
sure
he
confides
in
you
he
talks
to
you
about
his
occupations
his
ambitions
peter
continued
and
you
understand
him
you
enter
into
them
you
nice
to
him
you
help
him
oh
nick
life
it
very
dear
to
me
biddy
granted
that
must
be
jolly
for
him
it
makes
very
happy
peter
uttered
a
low
ambiguous
groan
then
he
cried
with
irritation
what
the
deuce
is
the
matter
with
them
then
why
ca
they
hit
it
off
together
and
be
quiet
and
rational
and
do
what
every
one
wants
them
to
oh
peter
it
awfully
complicated
the
girl
sighed
with
sagacity
do
you
mean
that
nick
in
love
with
her
in
love
with
julia
no
no
with
miriam
rooth
she
shook
her
head
slowly
then
with
a
smile
which
struck
him
as
one
of
the
sweetest
things
he
had
ever
seen
it
conveyed
at
the
expense
of
her
own
prospects
such
a
shy
generous
little
mercy
of
reassurance
he
is
peter
she
brought
out
julia
thinks
it
trifling
all
that
sort
of
thing
she
added
she
wants
him
to
go
in
for
different
honours
julia
the
oddest
woman
i
mean
i
thought
she
loved
him
peter
explained
and
when
you
love
a
person
he
continued
to
make
it
out
leaving
his
sentence
impatiently
unfinished
while
biddy
with
lowered
eyes
sat
waiting
it
so
interested
her
to
learn
what
you
did
when
you
loved
a
person
i
ca
conceive
her
giving
him
up
he
has
great
ability
besides
being
such
a
good
fellow
it
for
his
happiness
peter
that
the
way
she
reasons
biddy
set
forth
she
does
it
for
an
idea
she
has
told
me
a
great
deal
about
it
and
i
see
the
way
she
feels
you
try
to
biddy
because
you
such
a
dear
girl
but
i
do
believe
you
do
in
the
least
he
took
the
liberty
of
replying
it
too
little
the
way
you
yourself
would
feel
julia
idea
as
you
call
it
must
be
curious
well
it
is
peter
biddy
mournfully
admitted
she
wo
risk
not
coming
out
at
the
top
at
the
top
of
what
oh
of
everything
her
tone
showed
a
trace
of
awe
of
such
high
views
surely
one
at
the
top
of
everything
when
one
in
love
i
do
know
said
the
girl
do
you
doubt
it
peter
asked
i
never
been
in
love
and
i
never
shall
be
you
as
perverse
in
your
way
as
julia
he
returned
to
this
but
i
confess
i
do
understand
nick
attitude
any
better
he
seems
to
me
if
i
may
say
so
neither
fish
nor
flesh
oh
his
attitude
very
noble
peter
his
state
of
mind
wonderfully
interesting
biddy
pleaded
surely
must
be
in
favour
of
art
she
beautifully
said
it
made
him
look
at
her
a
moment
dear
biddy
your
little
digs
are
as
soft
as
zephyrs
she
coloured
but
she
protested
my
little
digs
what
do
you
mean
are
you
in
favour
of
art
the
question
delightfully
simple
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
everything
has
its
place
a
parliamentary
life
he
opined
scarce
seems
to
me
the
situation
for
that
just
what
nick
says
you
talk
of
it
together
a
great
deal
yes
nick
very
good
to
me
clever
nick
and
what
do
you
advise
him
oh
to
something
that
valuable
peter
laughed
not
to
give
up
his
sweetheart
for
the
sake
of
a
i
hope
never
never
peter
it
not
a
question
of
his
giving
up
biddy
pursued
for
julia
has
herself
shaken
free
i
think
she
never
really
felt
safe
she
loved
him
but
was
afraid
of
him
now
she
only
afraid
she
has
lost
the
confidence
she
tried
to
have
nick
has
tried
to
hold
her
but
she
has
wrested
herself
away
do
you
know
what
she
said
to
me
she
said
confidence
has
gone
for
ever
i
did
know
she
was
such
a
prig
julia
brother
commented
queer
people
verily
with
water
in
their
veins
instead
of
blood
you
and
i
would
be
like
that
should
we
though
you
taken
up
such
a
discouraging
position
about
caring
for
a
fellow
i
care
for
art
poor
biddy
returned
you
do
to
some
purpose
and
peter
glanced
at
the
bust
to
that
of
making
you
laugh
at
me
but
this
he
did
heed
would
you
give
a
good
man
up
for
a
good
man
what
man
well
say
me
if
i
wanted
to
marry
you
she
had
the
briefest
of
pauses
of
course
i
would
in
a
moment
at
any
rate
i
give
up
the
house
of
commons
she
amended
that
what
going
to
do
now
only
you
must
tell
any
one
peter
wondered
he
going
to
chuck
up
his
seat
i
think
his
mind
is
made
up
to
it
he
has
talked
me
over
we
had
some
deep
discussions
yes
i
on
the
side
of
art
she
ardently
said
do
you
mean
in
order
to
paint
to
paint
that
girl
peter
went
on
to
paint
every
one
that
what
he
wants
by
keeping
his
seat
he
kept
julia
and
she
was
the
thing
he
cared
for
most
in
public
life
when
he
has
got
out
of
the
whole
thing
his
attitude
as
he
says
will
be
at
least
clear
he
tremendously
interesting
about
it
peter
biddy
declared
has
talked
to
me
wonderfully
has
won
me
over
telling
will
be
the
hardest
part
if
she
does
know
he
asked
why
then
is
she
oh
at
the
hitch
about
their
marriage
she
knows
that
their
marriage
has
been
so
what
she
wanted
she
thought
it
perfection
she
blames
nick
fearfully
she
thinks
he
held
the
whole
thing
in
his
hand
and
that
he
has
thrown
away
a
magnificent
opportunity
and
what
does
nick
say
to
her
he
says
old
mummy
that
good
peter
pronounced
i
do
know
what
will
become
of
her
when
this
other
blow
arrives
biddy
went
on
poor
nick
wants
to
please
her
he
does
he
does
but
as
he
says
you
ca
please
every
one
and
you
must
before
you
die
please
yourself
a
little
nick
kinsman
whose
he
was
to
have
been
sat
looking
at
the
floor
the
colour
had
risen
to
his
face
while
he
listened
then
he
sprang
up
and
took
another
turn
about
the
room
his
artless
but
vivid
recital
had
set
his
blood
in
motion
he
had
taken
nick
political
prospects
very
much
for
granted
thought
of
them
as
definite
and
almost
dazzling
to
learn
there
was
something
for
which
he
was
ready
to
renounce
such
honours
and
to
recognise
the
nature
of
that
bribe
affected
our
young
man
powerfully
and
strangely
he
felt
as
if
he
had
heard
the
sudden
blare
of
a
trumpet
yet
felt
at
the
same
time
as
if
he
had
received
a
sudden
slap
in
the
face
nick
bribe
was
art
the
strange
temptress
with
whom
he
himself
had
been
wrestling
and
over
whom
he
had
finally
ventured
to
believe
that
wisdom
and
training
had
won
a
victory
there
was
something
in
the
conduct
of
his
old
friend
and
playfellow
that
made
all
his
reasonings
small
so
unexpected
so
courageous
a
choice
moved
him
as
a
reproach
and
a
challenge
he
felt
ashamed
of
having
placed
himself
so
unromantically
on
his
guard
and
rapidly
said
to
himself
that
if
nick
could
afford
to
allow
so
much
for
art
he
might
surely
exhibit
some
of
the
same
confidence
there
had
never
been
the
least
avowed
competition
between
the
cousins
their
lines
lay
too
far
apart
for
that
but
they
nevertheless
rode
their
course
in
sight
of
each
other
and
peter
had
now
the
impression
of
suddenly
seeing
nick
dormer
give
his
horse
the
spur
bound
forward
and
fly
over
a
wall
he
was
put
on
his
mettle
and
had
to
look
long
to
spy
an
obstacle
he
too
might
ride
at
high
rose
his
curiosity
to
see
what
warrant
his
kinsman
might
have
for
such
risks
how
he
was
mounted
for
such
exploits
he
really
knew
little
about
nick
talent
so
little
as
to
feel
no
right
to
exclaim
what
an
ass
when
biddy
mentioned
the
fact
which
the
existence
of
real
talent
alone
could
redeem
from
absurdity
all
his
eagerness
to
see
what
nick
had
been
able
to
make
of
such
a
subject
as
miriam
rooth
came
back
to
him
though
it
was
what
mainly
had
brought
him
to
rosedale
road
he
had
forgotten
it
in
the
happy
accident
of
his
encounter
with
the
girl
he
was
conscious
that
if
the
surprise
of
a
revelation
of
power
were
in
store
for
him
nick
would
be
justified
more
than
he
himself
would
feel
reinstated
in
since
the
courage
of
renouncing
the
forum
for
the
studio
hovered
before
him
as
greater
than
the
courage
of
marrying
an
actress
whom
one
was
in
love
with
the
reward
was
in
the
latter
case
so
much
more
immediate
peter
at
any
rate
asked
biddy
what
nick
had
done
with
his
portrait
of
miriam
he
seen
it
anywhere
in
rummaging
about
the
room
i
think
it
here
somewhere
but
i
do
know
she
replied
getting
up
to
look
vaguely
round
her
have
you
seen
it
has
he
shown
it
to
you
she
rested
her
eyes
on
him
strangely
a
moment
then
turned
them
away
with
a
mechanical
air
of
still
searching
i
think
it
in
the
room
put
away
with
its
face
to
the
wall
one
of
those
dozen
canvases
with
their
backs
to
us
one
of
those
perhaps
have
you
tried
to
see
i
have
touched
them
and
biddy
had
a
colour
has
nick
had
it
out
to
show
you
he
says
it
in
too
bad
a
state
it
is
finished
it
wo
do
and
have
you
had
the
curiosity
to
turn
it
round
for
yourself
the
embarrassed
look
in
her
face
deepened
under
his
insistence
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
her
eyes
pleaded
with
him
a
moment
almost
to
tears
i
had
an
idea
he
would
like
it
her
visitor
own
desire
however
had
become
too
sharp
for
easy
forbearance
he
laid
his
hand
on
two
or
three
canvases
which
proved
as
he
extricated
them
to
be
either
blank
or
covered
with
rudimentary
forms
dear
biddy
have
you
such
intense
delicacy
he
asked
pulling
out
something
else
the
inquiry
was
meant
in
familiar
kindness
for
peter
was
struck
even
to
admiration
with
her
having
a
sense
of
honour
that
all
girls
have
she
must
in
this
particular
case
have
longed
for
a
sight
of
nick
work
the
work
that
had
brought
about
such
a
crisis
in
his
life
but
she
had
passed
hours
in
his
studio
alone
without
permitting
herself
a
stolen
peep
she
was
capable
of
that
if
she
believed
it
would
please
him
peter
liked
a
charming
girl
being
capable
of
that
he
had
known
charming
girls
who
would
in
the
least
have
been
and
his
question
was
really
a
form
of
homage
biddy
however
apparently
discovered
some
light
mockery
in
it
and
she
broke
out
incongruously
i
have
wanted
so
much
to
see
it
i
do
care
for
her
so
much
as
that
so
much
as
what
he
could
but
wonder
i
do
care
for
his
actress
for
that
vulgar
creature
i
do
like
her
said
biddy
almost
startlingly
peter
stared
i
thought
you
had
seen
her
i
saw
her
in
paris
twice
she
was
wonderfully
clever
but
she
charm
me
he
quickly
considered
saying
then
all
kindly
i
wo
inflict
the
thing
on
you
in
that
case
we
leave
it
alone
for
the
present
biddy
made
no
reply
to
this
at
first
but
after
a
moment
went
straight
over
to
the
row
of
stacked
canvases
and
exposed
several
of
them
to
the
light
why
did
you
say
you
wished
to
go
to
the
theatre
her
companion
continued
still
she
was
silent
after
which
with
her
back
turned
to
him
and
a
little
tremor
in
her
voice
while
she
drew
forth
successively
her
brother
studies
she
made
answer
for
the
sake
of
your
company
peter
here
it
is
i
think
she
added
moving
a
large
canvas
with
some
effort
no
no
i
hold
it
for
you
is
that
the
light
she
would
let
him
take
it
she
bade
him
stand
off
and
allow
her
to
place
it
in
the
right
position
in
this
position
she
carefully
presented
it
supporting
it
at
the
proper
angle
from
behind
and
showing
her
head
and
shoulders
above
it
from
the
moment
his
eyes
rested
on
the
picture
peter
accepted
this
service
without
protest
unfinished
simplified
and
in
some
portions
merely
suggested
it
was
strong
vivid
and
assured
it
had
already
the
look
of
life
and
the
promise
of
power
peter
felt
all
this
and
was
startled
was
strangely
affected
he
had
no
idea
nick
moved
with
that
stride
miriam
seated
was
represented
in
almost
to
her
feet
she
leaned
forward
with
one
of
her
legs
crossed
over
the
other
her
arms
extended
and
foreshortened
her
hands
locked
together
round
her
knee
her
beautiful
head
was
bent
a
little
broodingly
and
her
splendid
face
seemed
to
look
down
at
life
she
had
a
grand
appearance
of
being
raised
aloft
with
a
wide
regard
a
survey
from
a
height
of
intelligence
for
the
great
field
of
the
artist
all
the
figures
and
passions
he
may
represent
peter
asked
himself
where
his
kinsman
had
learned
to
paint
like
that
he
almost
gasped
at
the
composition
of
the
thing
and
at
the
drawing
of
the
difficult
arms
biddy
abstained
from
looking
round
the
corner
of
the
canvas
as
she
held
it
she
only
watched
in
peter
eyes
for
this
gentleman
impression
of
it
that
she
easily
caught
and
he
measured
her
impression
her
impression
of
impression
when
he
went
after
a
few
minutes
to
relieve
her
she
let
him
lift
the
thing
out
of
her
grasp
he
moved
it
and
rested
it
so
that
they
could
still
see
it
against
the
high
back
of
a
chair
it
tremendously
good
he
then
handsomely
pronounced
dear
dear
nick
biddy
murmured
looking
at
it
now
poor
poor
julia
peter
was
prompted
to
exclaim
in
a
different
tone
his
companion
made
no
rejoinder
to
this
and
they
stood
another
minute
or
two
side
by
side
and
in
silence
gazing
at
the
portrait
at
last
he
took
up
his
hat
he
had
no
more
time
he
must
go
will
you
come
all
the
same
he
asked
with
a
laugh
that
was
somewhat
awkward
and
an
offer
of
a
all
the
same
biddy
seemed
to
wonder
why
you
say
she
a
terrible
creature
peter
completed
with
his
eyes
on
the
painted
face
oh
anything
for
art
biddy
smiled
well
at
seven
then
and
sherringham
departed
leaving
the
girl
alone
with
the
tragic
muse
and
feeling
with
a
quickened
rush
the
beauty
of
that
young
woman
as
well
as
all
freshly
the
peculiar
possibilities
of
nick
xxx
it
was
not
till
after
the
noon
of
the
next
day
that
he
was
to
see
miriam
rooth
he
wrote
her
a
note
that
evening
to
be
delivered
to
her
at
the
theatre
and
during
the
performance
she
sent
round
to
him
a
card
with
all
right
come
to
luncheon
scrawled
on
it
in
pencil
when
he
presented
himself
at
balaklava
place
he
learned
that
the
two
ladies
had
not
come
in
they
had
gone
again
early
to
rehearsal
but
they
had
left
word
that
he
was
to
be
pleased
to
wait
they
would
appear
from
one
moment
to
the
other
it
was
further
mentioned
to
him
as
he
was
ushered
into
the
that
dashwood
was
in
possession
of
that
ground
this
circumstance
however
peter
barely
noted
he
had
been
soaring
so
high
for
the
past
twelve
hours
that
he
had
almost
lost
consciousness
of
the
minor
differences
of
earthly
things
he
had
taken
biddy
dormer
and
her
friend
miss
tressilian
home
from
the
play
and
after
leaving
them
had
walked
about
the
streets
had
roamed
back
to
his
sister
house
in
a
state
of
exaltation
the
intenser
from
his
having
for
the
previous
time
contained
himself
thinking
it
more
decorous
and
considerate
less
invidious
and
less
blatant
not
to
rave
sitting
there
in
the
shade
of
the
box
with
his
companions
he
had
watched
miriam
in
attentive
but
inexpressive
silence
glowing
and
vibrating
inwardly
yet
for
these
fine
deep
reasons
not
committing
himself
to
the
spoken
rapture
delicacy
it
appeared
to
him
should
rule
the
hour
and
indeed
he
had
never
had
a
pleasure
less
alloyed
than
this
little
period
of
still
observation
and
repressed
ecstasy
miriam
art
lost
nothing
by
it
and
biddy
mild
nearness
only
gained
this
young
lady
was
virtually
mute
as
well
wonderingly
dauntedly
as
if
she
too
associated
with
the
performer
various
other
questions
than
that
of
her
mastery
of
her
art
to
this
mastery
biddy
attitude
was
a
candid
and
liberal
tribute
the
poor
girl
sat
quenched
and
pale
as
if
in
the
blinding
light
of
a
comparison
by
which
it
would
be
presumptuous
even
to
be
annihilated
her
subjection
however
was
a
gratified
a
charmed
subjection
there
was
beneficence
in
such
beauty
the
beauty
of
the
figure
that
moved
before
the
footlights
and
spoke
in
music
even
if
it
deprived
one
of
hope
peter
did
say
to
her
in
vulgar
elation
and
in
reference
to
her
whimsical
profession
of
dislike
at
the
studio
well
do
you
find
our
friend
so
disagreeable
now
and
she
was
grateful
to
him
for
his
forbearance
for
the
tacit
kindness
of
which
the
idea
seemed
to
be
my
poor
child
i
prefer
you
if
i
could
but
judge
for
yourself
how
can
i
expect
of
me
only
the
possible
expect
that
certainly
but
only
that
in
the
same
degree
peter
liked
biddy
sweet
hushed
air
of
judging
for
herself
of
recognising
his
discretion
and
letting
him
off
while
she
was
lost
in
the
illusion
in
the
convincing
picture
of
the
stage
miss
tressilian
did
most
of
the
criticism
she
broke
out
cheerfully
and
sonorously
from
time
to
time
in
reference
to
the
actress
most
striking
certainly
or
she
clever
is
she
she
uttered
a
series
of
propositions
to
which
her
companions
found
it
impossible
to
respond
miss
tressilian
was
disappointed
in
nothing
but
their
enjoyment
they
did
seem
to
think
the
exhibition
as
amusing
as
she
walking
away
through
the
ordered
void
of
lady
agnes
quarter
with
the
four
acts
of
the
play
glowing
again
before
him
in
the
smokeless
london
night
peter
found
the
liveliest
thing
in
his
impression
the
certitude
that
if
he
had
never
seen
miriam
before
and
she
had
had
for
him
none
of
the
advantages
of
association
he
would
still
have
recognised
in
her
performance
the
richest
interest
the
theatre
had
ever
offered
him
he
floated
in
the
felicity
of
it
in
the
general
encouragement
of
a
sense
of
the
perfectly
in
the
almost
aggressive
bravery
of
still
larger
claims
for
an
art
which
could
so
triumphantly
so
exquisitely
render
life
render
it
he
said
to
himself
create
it
and
reveal
it
rather
give
us
something
new
and
large
and
of
the
first
order
he
had
miriam
now
he
had
never
seen
her
before
he
had
never
seen
her
till
he
saw
her
in
her
conditions
oh
her
conditions
there
were
many
things
to
be
said
about
them
they
were
paltry
enough
as
yet
inferior
inadequate
obstructive
as
compared
with
the
right
full
finished
setting
of
such
a
talent
but
the
essence
of
them
was
now
irremovably
in
our
young
man
eyes
the
vision
of
how
the
uplifted
stage
and
the
listening
house
transformed
her
that
idea
of
her
having
no
character
of
her
own
came
back
to
him
with
a
force
that
made
him
laugh
in
the
empty
street
this
was
a
disadvantage
she
reduced
so
to
nothing
that
obviously
he
had
known
her
till
her
character
was
simply
to
hold
you
by
the
particular
spell
any
other
the
good
nature
of
home
the
relation
to
her
mother
her
friends
her
lovers
her
debts
the
practice
of
virtues
or
industries
or
vices
was
not
worth
speaking
of
these
things
were
the
fictions
and
shadows
the
representation
was
the
deep
substance
peter
had
as
he
went
an
intense
vision
he
had
often
had
it
before
of
the
conditions
still
absent
the
great
and
complete
ones
those
which
would
give
the
girl
talent
a
superior
a
discussable
stage
more
than
ever
he
desired
them
mentally
invoked
them
filled
them
out
in
imagination
cheated
himself
with
the
idea
that
they
were
possible
he
saw
them
in
a
momentary
illusion
and
confusion
a
great
academic
artistic
theatre
subsidised
and
unburdened
with
rich
in
its
repertory
rich
in
the
high
quality
and
the
wide
array
of
its
servants
rich
above
all
in
the
authority
of
an
impossible
administrator
a
manager
personally
disinterested
not
an
actor
with
an
eye
to
the
main
chance
pouring
forth
a
continuity
of
tradition
striving
for
perfection
laying
a
splendid
literature
under
contribution
he
saw
the
heroine
of
a
hundred
situations
variously
dramatic
and
vividly
real
he
saw
comedy
and
drama
and
passion
and
character
and
english
life
he
saw
all
humanity
and
history
and
poetry
and
then
perpetually
in
the
midst
of
them
shining
out
in
the
high
relief
of
some
great
moment
an
image
as
fresh
as
an
unveiled
statue
he
was
not
unconscious
that
he
was
taking
all
sorts
of
impossibilities
and
miracles
for
granted
but
he
was
under
the
conviction
for
the
time
that
the
woman
he
had
been
watching
three
hours
the
incarnation
of
the
serious
drama
would
be
a
new
and
vivifying
force
the
world
was
just
then
so
bright
to
him
that
even
basil
dashwood
struck
him
at
first
as
a
conceivable
agent
of
his
dream
it
must
be
added
that
before
miriam
arrived
the
breeze
that
filled
sherringham
sail
began
to
sink
a
little
he
passed
out
of
the
eminently
let
where
twenty
large
photographs
of
the
young
actress
bloomed
in
the
desert
he
went
into
the
garden
by
a
glass
door
that
stood
open
and
found
dashwood
lolling
on
a
bench
and
smoking
cigarettes
this
young
man
conversation
was
a
different
music
it
took
him
down
as
he
felt
showed
him
very
sensibly
and
intelligibly
it
must
be
confessed
the
actual
theatre
the
one
they
were
all
concerned
with
the
one
they
would
have
to
make
the
miserable
best
of
it
was
fortunate
that
he
kept
his
intoxication
mainly
to
himself
the
englishman
habit
of
not
being
effusive
still
prevailed
with
him
after
his
years
of
exposure
to
the
foreign
infection
nothing
could
have
been
less
exclamatory
than
the
meeting
of
the
two
men
with
its
question
or
two
its
remark
or
two
about
the
new
visitor
arrival
in
london
its
i
noticed
you
last
night
i
was
glad
you
turned
up
at
last
on
one
side
and
its
attenuated
oh
yes
it
was
the
first
time
i
was
very
much
interested
on
the
other
basil
dashwood
played
a
part
in
yolande
and
peter
had
not
failed
to
take
with
some
comfort
the
measure
of
his
aptitude
he
judged
it
to
be
of
the
small
order
as
indeed
the
part
which
was
neither
that
of
the
virtuous
nor
that
of
the
villainous
hero
restricted
him
to
two
or
three
inconspicuous
effects
and
three
or
four
changes
of
dress
he
represented
an
ardent
but
respectful
young
lover
whom
the
distracted
heroine
found
time
to
pity
a
little
and
even
to
rail
at
but
it
was
impressed
upon
his
critic
that
he
scarcely
represented
young
love
he
looked
very
well
but
peter
had
heard
him
already
in
a
hundred
contemporary
pieces
he
never
got
out
of
rehearsal
he
uttered
sentiments
and
breathed
vows
with
a
nice
voice
with
a
shy
boyish
tremor
but
as
if
he
were
afraid
of
being
chaffed
for
it
afterwards
giving
the
spectator
in
the
stalls
the
sense
of
holding
the
and
listening
to
a
recitation
he
made
one
think
of
and
and
private
theatricals
than
which
there
could
be
to
peter
mind
a
range
of
association
more
disconnected
from
the
actor
art
dashwood
knew
all
about
the
new
thing
the
piece
in
rehearsal
he
knew
all
about
everything
receipts
and
salaries
and
expenses
and
newspaper
articles
and
what
old
baskerville
said
and
what
ruffler
thought
matters
of
superficial
concern
to
his
who
wondered
before
they
had
sight
of
miriam
if
she
talked
with
her
about
them
by
the
hour
deep
in
them
and
finding
them
not
vulgar
and
boring
but
the
natural
air
of
her
life
and
the
essence
of
her
profession
of
course
she
did
she
naturally
would
it
was
all
in
the
day
work
and
he
might
feel
sure
she
would
turn
up
her
nose
at
the
shop
he
had
to
remind
himself
that
he
did
care
if
she
did
that
he
would
really
think
worse
of
her
if
she
should
she
certainly
was
in
deep
with
her
bland
playmate
talking
shop
by
the
hour
he
could
see
this
from
the
fellow
ease
of
attitude
the
air
of
a
man
at
home
and
doing
the
honours
he
divined
a
great
intimacy
between
the
two
young
artists
but
asked
himself
at
the
same
time
what
he
peter
sherringham
had
to
say
about
it
he
did
pretend
to
control
miriam
intimacies
it
was
to
be
supposed
and
if
he
had
encouraged
her
to
adopt
a
profession
rich
in
opportunities
for
comradeship
it
was
not
for
him
to
cry
out
because
she
had
taken
to
it
kindly
he
had
already
descried
a
fund
of
utility
in
lovick
light
brother
but
it
irritated
him
all
the
same
after
a
while
to
hear
the
youth
represent
himself
as
almost
indispensable
he
was
practical
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
and
this
idea
added
to
peter
paradoxical
sense
that
as
regards
the
matters
actually
in
question
he
himself
had
not
this
virtue
dashwood
had
got
rooth
the
house
it
happened
by
a
lucky
chance
that
laura
lumley
to
whom
it
belonged
sherringham
would
know
laura
lumley
wanted
to
get
rid
for
a
mere
song
of
the
remainder
of
the
lease
she
was
going
to
australia
with
a
troupe
of
her
own
they
just
stepped
into
it
it
was
good
air
the
best
sort
of
london
air
to
live
in
to
sleep
in
for
people
of
their
trade
peter
came
back
to
his
wonder
at
what
personal
relations
with
this
deucedly
knowing
gentleman
might
be
and
was
again
able
to
assure
himself
that
they
might
be
anything
in
the
world
she
liked
for
any
stake
he
the
familiar
of
the
foreign
office
had
in
them
dashwood
told
him
of
all
the
smart
people
who
had
tried
to
take
up
the
new
star
the
way
the
london
world
had
already
held
out
its
hand
and
perhaps
it
was
sherringham
irritation
the
crushed
sentiment
i
just
mentioned
that
gave
a
little
heave
in
the
exclamation
oh
that
that
all
rubbish
the
less
of
that
the
better
at
this
dashwood
sniffed
a
little
rather
resentful
he
had
expected
peter
to
be
pleased
with
the
names
of
the
eager
ladies
who
had
called
which
proved
how
low
a
view
he
took
of
his
art
our
friend
explained
it
is
to
be
hoped
not
pedantically
that
this
art
was
serious
work
and
that
society
was
humbug
and
imbecility
also
that
of
old
the
great
comedians
would
have
known
such
people
garrick
had
essentially
his
own
circle
no
i
suppose
they
did
in
the
old
time
said
basil
dashwood
your
profession
did
call
they
had
better
company
that
of
the
romantic
gallant
characters
they
represented
they
lived
with
so
it
was
better
all
round
and
peter
asked
himself
for
that
clearly
struck
the
young
man
as
a
dreary
period
if
only
for
miriam
in
her
new
life
and
among
the
futilities
of
those
who
tried
to
lionise
her
expressed
the
artistic
idea
this
at
least
sherringham
reflected
was
a
situation
that
could
be
improved
he
learned
from
his
companion
that
the
new
play
the
thing
they
were
rehearsing
was
an
old
play
a
romantic
drama
of
thirty
years
before
very
frequently
revived
and
threadbare
with
honourable
service
dashwood
had
a
part
in
it
but
there
was
an
act
in
which
he
did
appear
and
this
was
the
act
they
were
doing
that
morning
yolande
had
done
all
yolande
could
do
the
visitor
was
mistaken
if
he
supposed
yolande
such
a
tremendous
hit
it
had
done
very
well
it
had
run
three
months
but
they
were
by
no
means
coining
money
with
it
it
would
take
them
to
the
end
of
the
season
they
had
seen
for
a
month
past
that
they
would
have
to
put
on
something
else
miss
rooth
moreover
wanted
a
new
part
she
was
above
all
impatient
to
show
her
big
range
she
had
grand
ideas
she
thought
herself
very
to
repeat
the
same
stuff
for
three
months
the
young
man
lighted
another
cigarette
and
described
to
his
listener
some
of
miss
rooth
ideas
he
abounded
in
information
about
her
about
her
character
her
temper
her
peculiarities
her
little
ways
her
manner
of
producing
some
of
her
effects
he
spoke
with
familiarity
and
confidence
as
if
knowing
more
about
her
than
any
one
else
as
if
he
had
invented
or
discovered
her
were
in
a
sense
her
proprietor
or
guarantor
it
was
the
talk
of
the
shop
both
with
a
native
sharpness
and
a
touching
young
candour
the
expansion
of
the
commercial
spirit
when
it
relaxes
and
generalises
is
conscious
of
safety
with
another
member
of
the
guild
peter
at
any
rate
could
help
protesting
against
the
lame
old
it
was
proposed
to
bring
into
action
who
had
been
ridden
to
death
and
had
saved
a
thousand
desperate
fields
and
he
exclaimed
on
the
strange
passion
of
the
good
british
public
for
sitting
again
and
again
through
expected
situations
watching
for
speeches
they
had
heard
and
surprises
that
struck
the
hour
dashwood
defended
the
taste
of
london
praised
it
as
loyal
constant
faithful
to
which
his
interlocutor
retorted
with
some
vivacity
that
it
was
faithful
to
sad
trash
he
justified
this
sally
by
declaring
the
play
in
rehearsal
sad
trash
clumsy
mediocrity
with
all
its
convenience
gone
and
that
the
fault
was
the
want
of
life
in
the
critical
sense
of
the
public
which
was
ignobly
docile
opening
its
mouth
for
its
dose
like
the
pupils
of
dotheboys
hall
not
insisting
on
something
different
on
a
fresh
brew
altogether
dashwood
asked
him
if
he
then
wished
their
friend
to
go
on
playing
for
ever
a
part
she
had
repeated
more
than
eighty
nights
on
end
he
thought
the
modern
run
was
just
what
he
had
heard
him
denounce
in
paris
as
the
disease
the
theatre
was
dying
of
this
imputation
peter
quite
denied
wanting
to
know
if
she
could
change
to
something
less
stale
than
the
greatest
staleness
of
all
dashwood
opined
that
miss
rooth
must
have
a
strong
part
and
that
there
happened
to
be
one
for
her
in
the
venerable
novelty
she
had
to
take
what
she
could
get
she
was
a
person
to
cry
for
the
moon
this
was
a
she
would
try
other
things
later
she
would
have
to
look
round
her
you
could
have
a
new
piece
one
that
would
do
left
at
your
door
every
day
with
the
milk
on
one
point
sherringham
mind
might
be
at
rest
miss
rooth
was
a
woman
who
would
do
every
blessed
thing
there
was
to
do
give
her
time
and
she
would
walk
straight
through
the
repertory
she
was
a
woman
who
would
do
this
she
was
a
woman
who
would
do
that
her
spokesman
employed
this
phrase
so
often
that
peter
nervous
got
up
and
threw
an
unsmoked
cigarette
away
of
course
she
was
a
woman
there
was
no
need
of
his
saying
it
a
hundred
times
as
for
the
repertory
the
young
man
went
on
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
the
world
could
give
but
what
she
had
he
explained
after
their
visitor
sat
down
again
that
the
noise
made
by
miss
rooth
was
not
exactly
what
this
admirer
appeared
to
suppose
sherringham
had
seen
the
house
the
night
before
and
would
recognise
that
though
good
it
was
very
far
from
great
she
had
done
very
well
it
was
all
right
but
she
had
never
gone
above
a
point
which
dashwood
expressed
in
pounds
sterling
to
the
edification
of
his
companion
who
vaguely
thought
the
figure
high
peter
remembered
that
he
had
been
unable
to
get
a
stall
but
dashwood
insisted
that
miriam
had
not
leaped
into
commanding
fame
that
was
a
thing
that
never
happened
in
fact
it
happened
only
in
grotesque
works
of
fiction
she
had
attracted
notice
unusual
notice
for
a
woman
whose
name
the
day
before
had
never
been
heard
of
she
was
recognised
as
having
for
a
novice
extraordinary
cleverness
and
confidence
in
addition
to
her
looks
of
course
which
were
the
thing
that
had
really
fetched
the
crowd
but
she
had
been
the
talk
of
london
she
had
only
been
the
talk
of
gabriel
nash
he
was
london
more
was
the
pity
he
knew
the
esthetic
people
the
worldly
ones
not
the
frumpy
sickly
lot
who
wore
dirty
drapery
and
the
esthetic
people
had
run
after
her
dashwood
sketchily
instructed
the
pilgrim
from
paris
as
to
the
different
sects
in
the
great
religion
of
beauty
and
was
able
to
give
him
the
particular
note
of
the
critical
clique
to
which
miriam
had
begun
so
quickly
to
owe
it
that
she
had
a
vogue
the
information
made
our
friend
feel
very
ignorant
of
the
world
very
uninitiated
and
buried
in
his
little
professional
hole
dashwood
warned
him
that
it
would
be
a
long
time
before
the
general
public
would
wake
up
to
miss
rooth
even
after
she
had
waked
up
to
herself
she
would
have
to
do
some
really
big
thing
first
knew
it
was
in
her
the
big
thing
peter
and
he
and
even
poor
nash
because
they
had
seen
her
as
no
one
else
had
but
london
never
took
any
one
on
trust
it
had
to
be
cash
down
it
would
take
their
young
lady
two
or
three
years
to
pay
out
her
cash
and
get
her
equivalent
but
of
course
the
equivalent
would
be
simply
a
within
its
limits
however
certainly
the
mark
she
had
made
was
already
quite
a
there
was
magic
in
the
way
she
had
concealed
from
the
first
her
want
of
experience
she
absolutely
made
you
think
she
had
a
lot
of
it
more
than
any
one
else
dashwood
repeated
several
times
that
she
was
a
cool
hand
a
deucedly
cool
hand
and
that
he
watched
her
himself
saw
ideas
come
to
her
saw
her
have
different
notions
and
more
or
less
put
them
to
the
test
on
different
nights
she
was
always
alive
she
liked
it
herself
she
gave
him
ideas
long
as
he
had
been
on
the
stage
naturally
she
had
a
great
deal
to
learn
no
end
even
of
quite
basic
things
a
cosmopolite
like
sherringham
would
understand
that
a
girl
of
that
age
who
had
never
had
a
friend
but
her
mother
her
mother
was
greater
fun
than
ever
now
naturally
have
sherringham
winced
at
being
dubbed
a
cosmopolite
by
his
young
entertainer
just
as
he
had
winced
a
moment
before
at
hearing
himself
lumped
in
esoteric
knowledge
with
dashwood
and
gabriel
nash
but
the
former
of
these
gentlemen
took
no
account
of
his
sensibility
while
he
enumerated
a
few
of
the
elements
of
the
basic
he
was
a
mixture
of
acuteness
and
innocent
fatuity
and
peter
had
to
recognise
in
him
a
rudiment
or
two
of
criticism
when
he
said
that
the
wonderful
thing
in
the
girl
was
that
she
learned
so
fast
learned
something
every
night
learned
from
the
same
old
piece
a
lot
more
than
any
one
else
would
have
learned
from
twenty
that
what
it
is
to
be
a
genius
peter
concurred
genius
is
only
the
art
of
getting
your
experience
fast
of
stealing
it
as
it
were
and
in
this
sense
miss
rooth
a
regular
brigand
dashwood
condoned
the
subtlety
and
added
less
analytically
oh
she
do
it
was
exactly
in
these
simple
words
addressed
to
her
that
her
other
admirer
had
phrased
the
same
truth
yet
he
did
enjoy
hearing
them
on
his
lips
they
had
a
profane
patronising
sound
and
suggested
displeasing
equalities
the
two
men
sat
in
silence
for
some
minutes
watching
a
fat
robin
hop
about
on
the
little
seedy
lawn
at
the
end
of
which
they
heard
a
vehicle
stop
on
the
other
side
of
the
and
the
voices
of
occupants
alighting
here
they
come
the
dear
creatures
said
basil
dashwood
without
moving
and
from
where
they
sat
peter
saw
the
small
door
in
the
wall
pushed
open
the
dear
creatures
were
three
in
number
for
a
gentleman
had
added
himself
to
rooth
and
her
daughter
as
soon
as
miriam
eyes
took
in
her
parisian
friend
she
fell
into
a
large
droll
theatrical
attitude
and
seizing
her
mother
arm
exclaimed
passionately
look
where
he
sits
the
author
of
all
my
woes
cold
cynical
cruel
she
was
evidently
in
the
highest
spirits
of
which
rooth
partook
as
she
cried
indulgently
giving
her
a
slap
oh
get
along
you
gypsy
she
always
up
to
something
dashwood
laughed
as
miriam
radiant
and
with
a
conscious
stage
tread
glided
toward
sherringham
as
if
she
were
coming
to
the
footlights
he
rose
slowly
from
his
seat
looking
at
her
and
struck
with
her
beauty
he
had
been
impatient
to
see
her
yet
in
the
act
his
impatience
had
had
a
disconcerting
check
he
had
had
time
to
note
that
the
man
who
had
come
in
with
her
was
gabriel
nash
and
this
recognition
brought
a
low
sigh
to
his
lips
as
he
held
out
his
hand
to
her
a
sigh
expressive
of
the
sudden
sense
that
his
interest
in
her
now
could
only
be
a
gross
community
of
course
that
did
matter
since
he
had
set
it
at
the
most
such
rigid
limits
but
he
none
the
less
felt
vividly
reminded
that
it
would
be
public
and
notorious
that
inferior
people
would
be
inveterately
mixed
up
with
it
that
she
had
crossed
the
line
and
sold
herself
to
the
vulgar
making
him
indeed
only
one
of
an
equalised
multitude
the
way
nash
turned
up
there
just
when
he
did
want
to
see
him
proved
how
complicated
a
thing
it
was
to
have
a
friendship
with
a
young
woman
so
clearly
booked
for
renown
he
quite
forgot
that
the
intruder
had
had
this
object
of
interest
long
before
his
own
first
view
of
it
and
had
been
present
at
that
passage
which
he
had
in
a
measure
brought
about
had
sherringham
not
been
so
cut
out
to
make
trouble
of
this
particular
joy
he
might
have
found
some
adequate
assurance
that
their
young
hostess
distinguished
him
in
the
way
in
which
taking
his
hand
in
both
of
hers
she
looked
up
at
him
and
murmured
dear
old
master
then
as
if
this
were
not
acknowledgment
enough
she
raised
her
head
still
higher
and
whimsically
gratefully
charmingly
almost
nobly
kissed
him
on
the
lips
before
the
other
men
before
the
good
mother
whose
oh
you
honest
creature
made
everything
regular
xxxi
if
he
was
ruffled
by
some
of
her
conditions
there
was
thus
comfort
and
consolation
to
be
drawn
from
others
beside
the
essential
fascination
so
small
the
doubt
of
that
now
of
the
young
lady
own
society
he
spent
the
afternoon
they
all
spent
the
afternoon
and
the
occasion
reminded
him
of
pages
in
he
himself
could
pass
for
wilhelm
and
if
rooth
had
little
resemblance
to
mignon
miriam
was
remarkably
like
philina
the
movable
feast
awaiting
them
luncheon
tea
dinner
was
delayed
two
or
three
hours
but
the
interval
was
a
source
of
gaiety
for
they
all
smoked
cigarettes
in
the
garden
and
miriam
gave
striking
illustrations
of
the
parts
she
was
studying
peter
was
in
the
state
of
a
man
whose
toothache
has
suddenly
stopped
he
was
exhilarated
by
the
cessation
of
pain
the
pain
had
been
the
effort
to
remain
in
paris
after
the
creature
in
the
world
in
whom
he
was
most
interested
had
gone
to
london
and
the
balm
of
seeing
her
now
was
the
measure
of
the
previous
soreness
gabriel
nash
had
as
usual
plenty
to
say
and
he
talked
of
picture
so
long
that
peter
wondered
if
he
did
it
on
purpose
to
vex
him
they
went
in
and
out
of
the
house
they
made
excursions
to
see
what
form
the
vague
meal
was
taking
and
sherringham
got
half
an
hour
alone
or
virtually
alone
with
the
mistress
of
his
unsanctioned
passion
drawing
her
publicly
away
from
the
others
and
making
her
sit
with
him
in
the
most
sequestered
part
of
the
little
gravelled
grounds
there
was
summer
enough
for
the
trees
to
shut
out
the
adjacent
villas
and
basil
dashwood
and
gabriel
nash
lounged
together
at
a
convenient
distance
while
whimsical
friend
dropped
polished
pebbles
sometimes
audibly
splashing
into
the
deep
well
of
the
histrionic
simplicity
miriam
confessed
that
like
all
comedians
they
ate
at
queer
hours
she
sent
dashwood
in
for
biscuits
and
sherry
she
proposed
sending
him
round
to
the
grocer
in
the
circus
road
for
superior
wine
peter
judged
him
the
factotum
of
the
little
household
he
knew
where
the
biscuits
were
kept
and
the
state
of
the
grocer
account
when
he
himself
congratulated
her
on
having
so
useful
an
inmate
she
said
genially
but
as
if
the
words
disposed
of
him
oh
he
awfully
handy
to
this
she
added
you
not
you
know
resting
the
kindest
most
pitying
eyes
on
him
the
sensation
they
gave
him
was
as
sweet
as
if
she
had
stroked
his
cheek
and
her
manner
was
responsive
even
to
tenderness
she
called
him
dear
master
again
and
again
and
still
often
and
appeared
to
express
gratitude
and
reverence
by
every
intonation
you
doing
the
humble
dependent
now
he
said
you
do
it
beautifully
as
you
do
everything
she
replied
that
she
did
make
it
humble
enough
she
could
she
was
too
proud
too
insolent
in
her
triumph
she
liked
that
the
triumph
too
much
and
she
did
mind
telling
him
she
was
perfectly
happy
of
course
as
yet
the
triumph
was
very
limited
but
success
was
success
whatever
its
quantity
the
dish
was
a
small
one
but
had
the
right
taste
her
imagination
had
already
bounded
beyond
the
first
phase
unexpectedly
great
as
this
had
been
her
position
struck
her
as
modest
compared
with
the
probably
future
now
vivid
to
her
peter
had
never
seen
her
so
soft
and
sympathetic
she
had
insisted
in
paris
that
her
personal
character
was
that
of
the
good
girl
she
used
the
term
in
a
fine
loose
way
and
it
was
impossible
to
be
a
better
girl
than
she
showed
herself
this
pleasant
afternoon
she
was
full
of
gossip
and
anecdote
and
drollery
she
had
exactly
the
air
he
would
have
wished
her
to
have
that
of
thinking
of
no
end
of
things
to
tell
him
it
was
as
if
she
had
just
returned
from
a
long
journey
and
had
had
strange
adventures
and
made
wonderful
discoveries
she
began
to
speak
of
this
and
that
then
broke
off
to
speak
of
something
else
she
talked
of
the
theatre
of
the
critics
and
above
all
of
london
of
the
people
she
had
met
and
the
extraordinary
things
they
said
to
her
of
the
parts
she
was
going
to
take
up
of
lots
of
new
ideas
that
had
come
to
her
about
the
art
of
comedy
she
wanted
to
do
comedy
now
to
do
the
comedy
of
london
life
she
was
delighted
to
find
that
seeing
more
of
the
world
suggested
things
to
her
they
came
straight
from
the
fact
from
nature
if
you
could
call
it
nature
she
was
thus
convinced
more
than
ever
that
the
artist
ought
to
so
as
to
get
on
with
his
business
gathering
ideas
and
lights
from
experience
ought
to
welcome
any
experience
that
would
give
him
lights
but
work
of
course
experience
and
everything
in
one
life
that
was
good
was
work
that
was
the
jolly
thing
in
the
actor
trade
it
made
up
for
other
elements
that
were
odious
if
you
only
kept
your
eyes
open
nothing
could
happen
to
you
that
would
be
food
for
observation
and
grist
to
your
mill
showing
you
how
people
looked
and
moved
and
spoke
cried
and
grimaced
writhed
and
dissimulated
in
given
situations
she
saw
all
round
her
things
she
wanted
to
do
london
bristled
with
them
if
you
had
eyes
to
see
she
was
fierce
to
know
why
people
did
take
them
up
put
them
into
plays
and
parts
give
one
a
chance
with
them
she
expressed
her
sharp
impatience
of
the
general
literary
she
had
never
been
chary
of
this
particular
displeasure
and
there
were
moments
it
was
an
old
story
and
a
subject
of
frank
raillery
to
sherringham
when
to
hear
her
you
might
have
thought
there
was
no
cleverness
anywhere
but
in
her
own
splendid
impatience
she
wanted
tremendous
things
done
that
she
might
use
them
but
she
did
pretend
to
say
exactly
what
they
were
to
be
nor
even
approximately
how
they
were
to
be
handled
her
ground
was
rather
that
if
only
had
a
pen
it
was
exasperating
to
have
to
explain
she
mainly
contented
herself
with
the
view
that
nothing
had
really
been
touched
she
felt
that
more
and
more
as
she
saw
more
of
people
peter
went
to
her
theatre
again
that
evening
and
indeed
made
no
scruple
of
going
every
night
for
a
week
rather
perhaps
i
should
say
he
made
a
scruple
but
a
high
part
of
the
pleasure
of
his
life
during
these
arbitrary
days
was
to
overcome
it
the
only
way
to
prove
he
could
overcome
it
was
to
go
and
he
was
satisfied
after
he
had
been
seven
times
not
only
with
the
spectacle
on
the
stage
but
with
his
perfect
independence
he
knew
no
satiety
however
with
the
spectacle
on
the
stage
which
induced
for
him
but
a
further
curiosity
performance
was
a
thing
alive
with
a
power
to
change
to
grow
to
develop
to
beget
new
forms
of
the
same
life
peter
contributed
to
it
in
his
amateurish
way
and
watched
with
solicitude
the
effect
of
his
care
and
the
fortune
of
his
hints
he
talked
it
over
in
balaklava
place
suggested
modifications
and
variations
worth
trying
she
professed
herself
thankful
for
any
refreshment
that
could
be
administered
to
her
interest
in
and
with
an
energy
that
showed
large
resource
touched
up
her
part
and
drew
several
new
airs
from
it
liberties
bore
on
her
way
of
uttering
certain
speeches
the
intonations
that
would
have
more
beauty
or
make
the
words
mean
more
she
had
her
ideas
or
rather
she
had
her
instincts
which
she
defended
and
illustrated
with
a
vividness
superior
to
argument
by
a
happy
pictorial
phrase
or
a
snatch
of
mimicry
but
she
was
always
for
trying
she
liked
experiments
and
caught
at
them
and
she
was
especially
thankful
when
some
one
gave
her
a
showy
reason
a
plausible
formula
in
a
case
where
she
only
stood
on
an
intuition
she
pretended
to
despise
reasons
and
to
like
and
dislike
at
her
sovereign
pleasure
but
she
always
honoured
the
exotic
gift
so
that
sherringham
was
amused
with
the
liberal
way
she
produced
it
as
if
she
had
been
a
naked
islander
rejoicing
in
a
present
of
crimson
cloth
day
after
day
he
spent
most
of
his
time
in
her
society
and
miss
laura
lumley
recent
habitation
became
the
place
in
london
to
which
his
thoughts
and
his
steps
were
most
attached
he
was
highly
conscious
of
his
not
now
carrying
out
that
principle
of
abstention
he
had
brought
to
such
maturity
before
leaving
paris
but
he
contented
himself
with
a
much
cruder
justification
of
this
lapse
than
he
would
have
thought
adequate
in
advance
it
consisted
simply
in
the
idea
that
to
be
identified
with
the
first
fresh
exploits
of
a
young
genius
was
a
delightful
experience
what
was
the
harm
of
it
when
the
genius
was
real
his
main
security
was
thus
that
his
relations
with
miriam
had
been
placed
under
the
protection
of
that
idea
of
approved
extravagance
in
this
department
they
made
a
very
creditable
figure
and
required
much
less
watching
and
pruning
than
when
it
had
been
his
effort
to
adjust
them
to
a
worldly
plan
he
had
in
fine
a
sense
of
real
wisdom
when
he
pronounced
it
surely
enough
that
this
momentary
intellectual
participation
in
the
girl
dawning
fame
was
a
charming
thing
charming
things
were
not
frequent
enough
in
a
busy
man
life
to
be
kicked
out
of
the
way
balaklava
place
looked
at
in
this
philosophic
way
became
almost
idyllic
it
gave
peter
the
pleasantest
impression
he
had
ever
had
of
london
the
season
happened
to
be
remarkably
fine
the
temperature
was
high
but
not
so
high
as
to
keep
people
from
the
theatre
miriam
business
visibly
increased
so
that
the
question
of
putting
on
the
second
play
underwent
some
revision
the
girl
persisted
showing
in
her
persistence
a
temper
of
which
peter
had
already
caught
some
sharp
gleams
it
was
plain
that
through
her
career
she
would
expect
to
carry
things
with
a
high
hand
her
managers
and
agents
would
find
her
an
easy
victim
or
a
calculable
force
but
the
public
would
adore
her
surround
her
with
the
popularity
that
attaches
to
a
and
princess
and
her
comrades
would
have
a
kindness
for
her
because
she
would
be
selfish
they
too
would
besides
representing
her
form
in
a
manner
a
portion
of
her
affectionate
public
this
was
the
way
her
friend
read
the
signs
liking
her
whimsical
tolerance
of
some
of
her
vulgar
playfellows
almost
well
enough
to
forgive
their
presence
in
balaklava
place
where
they
were
a
sore
trial
to
her
mother
who
wanted
her
to
multiply
her
points
of
contact
only
with
the
higher
orders
there
were
hours
when
peter
seemed
to
make
out
that
her
principal
relation
to
the
proper
world
would
be
to
have
within
two
or
three
years
a
grand
battle
with
it
resulting
in
its
taking
her
should
she
let
it
have
her
at
all
absolutely
on
her
own
terms
a
picture
which
led
our
young
man
to
ask
himself
with
a
helplessness
that
was
not
exempt
as
he
perfectly
knew
from
absurdity
what
part
should
find
himself
playing
in
such
a
contest
and
if
it
would
be
reserved
to
him
to
be
the
more
ridiculous
as
a
peacemaker
or
as
a
heavy
backer
she
might
know
any
one
she
would
and
the
only
person
she
appears
to
take
any
pleasure
in
is
that
dreadful
miss
rover
rooth
whimpered
to
him
more
than
once
leading
him
thus
to
recognise
in
the
young
lady
so
designated
the
principal
complication
of
balaklava
place
miss
rover
was
a
little
actress
who
played
at
miriam
theatre
combining
with
an
unusual
aptitude
for
delicate
comedy
a
less
exceptional
absence
of
rigour
in
private
life
she
was
pretty
and
quick
and
brave
and
had
a
fineness
that
miriam
professed
herself
already
in
a
position
to
estimate
as
rare
she
had
no
control
of
her
inclinations
yet
sometimes
they
were
wholly
laudable
like
the
devotion
she
had
formed
for
her
beautiful
colleague
whom
she
admired
not
only
as
an
ornament
of
the
profession
but
as
a
being
altogether
of
a
more
fortunate
essence
she
had
had
an
idea
that
real
ladies
were
nasty
but
miriam
was
not
nasty
and
who
could
gainsay
that
miriam
was
a
real
lady
the
girl
justified
herself
to
her
patron
from
paris
who
had
found
no
fault
with
her
she
knew
how
much
her
mother
feared
the
proper
world
would
come
in
if
they
knew
that
the
improper
in
the
person
of
pretty
miss
rover
was
on
the
ground
what
did
she
care
who
came
and
who
did
and
what
was
to
be
gained
by
receiving
half
the
snobs
in
london
people
would
have
to
take
her
exactly
as
they
found
her
that
they
would
have
to
learn
and
they
would
be
much
mistaken
if
they
thought
her
capable
of
turning
snob
too
for
the
sake
of
their
sweet
company
she
did
pretend
to
be
anything
but
what
she
meant
to
be
the
best
general
actress
of
her
time
and
what
had
that
to
do
with
her
seeing
or
not
seeing
a
poor
ignorant
girl
who
had
loved
well
she
need
say
what
fanny
had
done
they
had
met
in
the
way
of
business
she
did
say
she
would
have
run
after
her
she
had
liked
her
because
she
was
a
slick
and
when
fanny
rover
had
asked
her
quite
wistfully
if
she
might
come
and
see
her
and
like
her
she
had
bristled
with
scandalised
virtue
miss
rover
was
a
bit
more
stupid
or
more
than
any
one
else
it
would
be
time
enough
to
shut
the
door
when
she
should
become
so
peter
commended
even
to
extravagance
the
liberality
of
such
comradeship
said
that
of
course
a
woman
did
go
into
that
profession
to
see
how
little
she
could
swallow
she
was
right
to
live
with
the
others
so
long
as
they
were
at
all
possible
and
it
was
for
her
and
only
for
her
to
judge
how
long
that
might
be
this
was
rather
heroic
on
his
part
for
his
assumed
detachment
from
the
girl
personal
life
still
left
him
a
margin
for
some
forms
of
uneasiness
it
would
have
made
in
his
spirit
a
great
difference
for
the
worse
that
the
woman
he
loved
and
for
whom
he
wished
no
baser
lover
than
himself
should
have
embraced
the
prospect
of
consorting
only
with
the
cheaper
kind
it
was
all
very
well
but
fanny
rover
was
simply
a
rank
and
that
sort
of
association
was
an
odd
training
for
a
young
woman
who
was
to
have
been
good
enough
he
could
forget
that
but
kept
remembering
it
as
if
it
might
still
have
a
future
use
to
be
his
admired
wife
certainly
he
ought
to
have
thought
of
such
things
before
he
permitted
himself
to
become
so
interested
in
a
theatrical
nature
his
heroism
did
him
service
however
for
the
hour
it
helped
him
by
the
end
of
the
week
to
feel
quite
broken
in
to
little
circle
what
helped
him
most
indeed
was
to
reflect
that
she
would
get
tired
of
a
good
many
of
its
members
herself
in
time
for
if
it
was
not
that
they
were
shocking
very
few
of
them
shone
with
that
intense
light
they
could
yet
be
thoroughly
trusted
in
the
long
run
to
bore
you
there
was
a
lovely
sunday
in
particular
spent
by
him
almost
all
in
balaklava
place
he
arrived
so
early
when
in
the
afternoon
every
sort
of
odd
person
dropped
in
miriam
held
a
reception
in
the
little
garden
and
insisted
on
all
the
company
staying
to
supper
her
mother
shed
tears
to
peter
in
the
desecrated
house
because
they
had
accepted
miriam
and
she
an
invitation
and
in
cromwell
road
too
for
the
evening
miriam
had
now
decreed
they
should
go
they
would
have
so
much
better
fun
with
their
good
friends
at
home
she
was
sending
off
a
message
it
was
a
terrible
distance
by
a
cabman
and
peter
had
the
privilege
of
paying
the
messenger
basil
dashwood
in
another
vehicle
proceeded
to
an
hotel
known
to
him
a
mile
away
for
supplementary
provisions
and
came
back
with
a
cold
ham
and
a
dozen
of
champagne
it
was
all
very
bohemian
and
dishevelled
and
delightful
very
supposedly
droll
and
enviable
to
outsiders
and
miriam
told
anecdotes
and
gave
imitations
of
the
people
she
would
have
met
if
she
had
gone
out
so
that
no
one
had
a
sense
of
loss
the
two
occasions
were
fantastically
united
rooth
drank
champagne
for
consolation
though
the
consolation
was
imperfect
when
she
remembered
she
might
have
drunk
it
though
not
quite
so
much
perhaps
in
cromwell
road
taken
in
connection
with
the
evening
before
the
day
formed
for
our
friend
the
most
complete
exhibition
of
his
young
woman
he
had
yet
enjoyed
he
had
been
at
the
theatre
to
which
the
saturday
night
happened
to
have
brought
the
very
fullest
house
she
had
played
to
and
he
came
early
to
balaklava
place
to
tell
her
once
again
he
had
told
her
times
the
evening
before
that
with
the
excitement
of
her
biggest
audience
she
had
surpassed
herself
acted
with
remarkable
intensity
it
pleased
her
to
hear
this
and
the
spirit
with
which
she
interpreted
the
signs
of
the
future
and
during
an
hour
he
spent
alone
with
her
rooth
being
upstairs
and
basil
dashwood
luckily
absent
treated
him
to
twenty
specimens
of
feigned
passion
and
character
was
beyond
any
natural
abundance
he
had
yet
seen
in
a
woman
the
impression
could
scarcely
have
been
other
if
she
had
been
playing
wild
snatches
to
him
at
the
piano
the
bright
flame
of
her
talk
rose
and
fell
like
an
improvisation
on
the
keys
later
the
rest
of
the
day
he
could
as
little
miss
the
good
grace
with
which
she
fraternised
with
her
visitors
finding
always
the
fair
word
for
each
the
key
to
a
common
ease
the
right
turn
to
keep
vanity
quiet
and
make
humility
brave
it
was
a
wonderful
expenditure
of
generous
nervous
life
but
what
he
read
in
it
above
all
was
the
sense
of
success
in
youth
with
the
future
loose
and
big
and
the
action
of
that
charm
on
the
faculties
miriam
limited
past
had
yet
pinched
her
enough
to
make
emancipation
sweet
and
the
emancipation
had
come
at
last
in
an
hour
she
had
stepped
into
her
magic
shoes
divined
and
appropriated
everything
they
could
help
her
to
become
in
a
day
a
really
original
contemporary
he
was
of
course
not
less
conscious
of
that
than
nick
dormer
had
been
when
in
the
cold
light
of
his
studio
this
more
detached
observer
saw
too
how
she
had
altered
but
the
great
thing
to
his
mind
and
during
these
first
days
the
irresistible
seduction
of
the
theatre
was
that
she
was
a
rare
revelation
of
beauty
beauty
was
the
principle
of
everything
she
did
and
of
the
way
she
unerringly
did
it
an
exquisite
harmony
of
line
and
motion
and
attitude
and
tone
what
was
at
once
most
general
and
most
special
in
her
performance
accidents
and
instincts
played
together
to
this
end
and
constituted
something
that
was
independent
of
her
talent
or
of
her
merit
in
a
given
case
and
which
as
a
value
to
imagination
was
far
superior
to
any
merit
and
any
talent
he
could
but
call
it
a
felicity
and
an
importance
incalculable
and
but
know
that
it
connected
itself
with
universal
values
to
see
this
force
in
operation
to
sit
within
its
radius
and
feel
it
shift
and
revolve
and
change
and
never
fail
was
a
corrective
to
the
depression
the
humiliation
the
bewilderment
of
life
it
transported
our
troubled
friend
from
the
vulgar
hour
and
the
ugly
fact
drew
him
to
something
that
had
no
warrant
but
its
sweetness
no
name
nor
place
save
as
the
pure
the
remote
the
antique
it
was
what
most
made
him
say
to
himself
oh
hang
it
what
does
it
matter
when
he
reflected
that
an
as
they
said
in
paris
rather
gave
himself
away
as
they
said
in
america
by
going
every
night
to
the
same
sordid
stall
at
which
all
the
world
might
stare
it
was
what
kept
him
from
doing
anything
but
hover
round
miriam
kept
him
from
paying
any
other
visits
from
attending
to
any
business
from
going
back
to
calcutta
gardens
it
was
a
spell
he
shrank
intensely
from
breaking
and
the
cause
of
a
hundred
postponements
confusions
and
absurdities
it
put
him
in
a
false
position
altogether
but
it
made
of
the
crooked
little
stucco
villa
in
saint
john
wood
a
place
in
the
upper
air
commanding
the
prospect
a
nest
of
winged
liberties
and
ironies
far
aloft
above
the
huddled
town
one
should
live
at
altitudes
when
one
could
they
braced
and
simplified
and
for
a
happy
interval
he
never
touched
the
earth
it
was
not
that
there
were
no
influences
tending
at
moments
to
drag
him
down
an
abasement
from
which
he
escaped
only
because
he
was
up
so
high
we
have
seen
that
basil
dashwood
could
affect
him
at
times
as
a
chunk
of
wood
tied
to
his
ankle
this
through
the
circumstance
that
he
made
miriam
famous
conditions
those
of
the
public
exhibition
of
her
genius
seem
small
and
prosaic
so
that
peter
had
to
remind
himself
how
much
this
smallness
was
perhaps
involved
in
their
being
at
all
she
carried
his
imagination
off
into
infinite
spaces
whereas
she
carried
dashwood
only
into
the
and
the
revival
of
plays
that
were
barbarously
bad
the
worst
was
its
being
so
open
to
him
to
see
that
a
sharp
young
man
really
in
the
business
might
know
better
than
he
another
vessel
of
superior
knowledge
he
talked
that
is
as
if
he
knew
better
than
any
one
was
gabriel
nash
who
lacked
no
leisure
for
hatefully
haunting
balaklava
place
or
in
other
words
appeared
to
enjoy
the
same
command
of
his
time
as
peter
sherringham
the
pilgrim
from
paris
regarded
him
with
mingled
feelings
for
he
had
not
forgotten
the
contentious
character
of
their
first
meeting
or
the
degree
to
which
he
had
been
moved
to
urge
upon
nick
dormer
consideration
that
his
talkative
friend
was
probably
one
of
the
most
eminent
of
asses
this
personage
turned
up
now
as
an
admirer
of
the
charming
creature
he
had
scoffed
at
and
there
was
much
to
exasperate
in
the
smooth
gloss
of
his
inconsistency
at
which
he
never
cast
an
embarrassed
glance
he
practised
indeed
such
loose
license
of
regard
to
every
question
that
it
was
difficult
in
vulgar
parlance
to
have
him
his
sympathies
hummed
about
like
bees
in
a
garden
with
no
visible
plan
no
economy
in
their
flight
he
thought
meanly
of
the
modern
theatre
and
yet
had
discovered
a
fund
of
satisfaction
in
the
most
promising
of
its
exponents
and
peter
could
more
than
once
but
say
to
him
that
he
should
really
to
keep
his
opinions
at
all
in
hand
attach
more
value
to
the
stage
or
less
to
the
interesting
a
tress
miriam
took
her
perfect
ease
at
his
expense
and
treated
him
as
the
most
abject
of
her
slaves
all
of
which
was
worth
seeing
as
an
exhibition
on
nash
part
of
the
beautifully
imperturbable
when
peter
all
too
grossly
pronounced
him
damned
impudent
he
always
felt
guilty
later
on
of
an
injustice
nash
had
so
little
the
air
of
a
man
with
something
to
gain
he
was
aware
nevertheless
of
a
certain
itching
in
his
when
his
brought
out
and
for
the
most
part
to
miriam
herself
in
answer
to
any
charge
of
tergiversation
oh
it
all
right
it
the
voice
you
know
the
enchanting
voice
nash
meant
by
this
as
indeed
he
more
fully
set
forth
that
he
came
to
the
theatre
or
to
the
villa
simply
to
treat
his
ear
to
the
sound
the
richest
then
to
be
heard
on
earth
as
he
maintained
issuing
from
miriam
lips
its
richness
was
quite
independent
of
the
words
she
might
pronounce
or
the
poor
fable
they
might
subserve
and
if
the
pleasure
of
hearing
her
in
public
was
the
greater
by
reason
of
the
larger
volume
of
her
utterance
it
was
still
highly
agreeable
to
see
her
at
home
for
it
was
there
the
strictly
mimetic
gift
he
freely
conceded
to
her
came
out
most
he
spoke
as
if
she
had
been
formed
by
the
bounty
of
nature
to
be
his
particular
recreation
and
as
if
being
an
expert
in
innocent
joys
he
took
his
pleasure
wherever
he
found
it
he
was
perpetually
in
the
field
sociable
amiable
communicative
inveterately
contradicted
but
never
confounded
ready
to
talk
to
any
one
about
anything
and
making
disagreement
of
which
he
left
the
responsibility
wholly
to
others
a
basis
of
harmony
every
one
knew
what
he
thought
of
the
theatrical
profession
and
yet
who
could
say
he
regard
its
members
as
embodiments
of
comedy
when
he
touched
with
such
a
hand
the
spring
of
their
foibles
touched
it
with
an
art
that
made
even
peter
laugh
notwithstanding
his
attitude
of
reserve
where
this
interloper
was
concerned
at
any
rate
though
he
had
committed
himself
as
to
their
general
fatuity
he
put
up
with
their
company
for
the
sake
of
miriam
vocal
vibrations
with
a
practical
philosophy
that
was
all
his
own
and
she
frankly
took
him
for
her
supreme
her
incorrigible
adorer
masquerading
as
a
critic
to
save
his
vanity
and
tolerated
for
his
secret
constancy
in
spite
of
being
a
bore
he
was
meanwhile
really
not
a
bore
to
peter
who
failed
of
the
luxury
of
being
able
to
regard
him
as
one
he
had
seen
too
many
strange
countries
and
curious
things
observed
and
explored
too
much
to
be
void
of
illustration
peter
had
a
sense
that
if
he
himself
was
in
the
gabriel
had
probably
as
a
finer
critic
a
still
wider
range
if
among
associates
dashwood
dragged
him
down
the
other
main
sharer
of
his
privilege
challenged
him
rather
to
higher
and
more
fantastic
flights
if
he
saw
the
girl
in
larger
relations
than
the
young
actor
who
mainly
saw
her
in
parts
nash
went
a
step
further
and
regarded
her
irresponsibly
and
sublimely
as
a
priestess
of
harmony
a
figure
with
which
the
vulgar
ideas
of
success
and
failure
had
nothing
to
do
he
laughed
at
her
parts
holding
that
without
them
she
would
still
be
great
peter
envied
him
his
power
to
content
himself
with
the
pleasures
he
could
get
peter
had
a
shrewd
impression
that
contentment
would
be
the
final
sweetener
of
his
own
repast
above
all
nash
held
his
attention
by
a
constant
element
of
easy
reference
to
nick
dormer
who
as
we
know
had
suddenly
become
much
more
interesting
to
his
kinsman
peter
found
food
for
observation
and
in
some
measure
for
perplexity
in
the
relations
of
all
these
clever
people
with
each
other
he
knew
why
his
sister
who
had
a
personal
impatience
of
unapplied
ideas
had
not
been
agreeably
affected
by
miriam
prime
patron
and
had
not
felt
happy
about
the
attribution
of
value
to
such
people
by
the
man
she
was
to
marry
this
was
a
side
on
which
he
had
no
desire
to
resemble
julia
for
he
needed
no
teaching
to
divine
that
nash
must
have
found
her
accessible
to
no
light
none
even
about
himself
he
peter
would
have
been
sorry
to
have
to
confess
he
could
more
or
less
understand
him
he
understood
furthermore
that
miriam
in
nick
studio
might
very
well
have
appeared
to
julia
a
formidable
force
she
was
younger
and
would
have
seen
nothing
but
she
had
quite
as
much
her
own
resources
and
was
beautiful
enough
to
have
made
nick
compare
her
with
the
lady
of
harsh
even
if
he
had
been
in
love
with
that
benefactress
a
pretension
as
to
which
her
brother
as
we
know
entertained
doubts
peter
at
all
events
saw
for
many
days
nothing
of
his
cousin
though
it
might
have
been
said
that
nick
participated
by
implication
at
least
in
the
life
of
balaklava
place
had
he
given
julia
tangible
grounds
and
was
his
unexpectedly
fine
rendering
of
miriam
an
act
of
virtual
infidelity
in
that
case
to
what
degree
was
the
girl
to
be
regarded
as
an
accomplice
in
his
defection
and
what
was
the
real
nature
of
miriam
esteem
for
her
new
and
as
he
might
be
called
distinguished
ally
these
questions
would
have
given
peter
still
more
to
think
about
had
he
not
flattered
himself
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
they
concerned
nick
and
his
sitter
herself
infinitely
more
than
they
concerned
any
one
else
that
young
lady
meanwhile
was
personally
before
him
so
that
he
had
no
need
to
consult
for
his
pleasure
his
fresh
recollection
of
the
portrait
but
he
thought
of
this
striking
production
each
time
he
thought
of
his
so
kinsman
variety
of
range
and
that
happened
often
for
in
his
hearing
miriam
often
discussed
the
happy
artist
and
his
possibilities
with
gabriel
nash
and
nash
broke
out
about
them
to
all
who
might
hear
her
own
tone
on
the
subject
was
uniform
she
kept
it
on
record
to
a
degree
slightly
irritating
that
dormer
had
been
unforgettably
peter
particularly
noted
unforgettably
kind
to
her
she
never
mentioned
julia
irruption
to
julia
brother
she
only
referred
to
the
portrait
with
inscrutable
amenity
as
a
direct
consequence
of
this
gentleman
fortunate
suggestion
that
first
day
at
madame
carré
nash
showed
however
such
a
disposition
to
dwell
sociably
and
luminously
on
the
peculiarly
interesting
character
of
what
he
called
dormer
predicament
and
on
the
fine
suspense
it
was
fitted
to
kindle
in
the
breast
of
the
truly
discerning
that
peter
wondered
as
i
have
already
hinted
if
this
insistence
were
not
a
subtle
perversity
a
devilish
little
invention
to
torment
a
man
whose
jealousy
was
presumable
yet
his
struck
him
as
on
the
whole
but
scantly
devilish
and
as
still
less
occupied
with
the
prefigurement
of
so
plain
a
man
emotions
indeed
he
threw
a
glamour
of
romance
over
nick
tossed
off
toward
him
such
illuminating
yet
mystifying
references
that
they
operated
quite
as
a
bait
to
curiosity
invested
with
amusement
the
view
of
the
possible
any
wish
to
follow
out
the
chain
of
events
he
learned
from
gabriel
that
nick
was
still
away
and
he
then
felt
he
could
almost
submit
to
instruction
to
initiation
the
loose
charm
of
these
days
was
troubled
however
it
ceased
to
be
idyllic
when
late
on
the
evening
of
the
second
sunday
he
walked
away
with
nash
southward
from
saint
john
wood
for
then
something
came
out
book
six
xxxii
it
mattered
not
so
much
what
the
doctors
thought
and
sir
matthew
hope
the
greatest
of
them
all
had
been
down
twice
in
one
week
as
that
chayter
the
omniscient
butler
declared
with
all
the
authority
of
his
position
and
his
experience
that
carteret
was
very
bad
indeed
nick
dormer
had
a
long
talk
with
him
it
lasted
six
minutes
the
day
he
hurried
to
beauclere
in
response
to
a
telegram
it
was
chayter
who
had
taken
upon
himself
to
telegraph
in
spite
of
the
presence
in
the
house
of
carteret
nearest
relation
and
only
surviving
sister
lendon
this
lady
a
large
mild
healthy
woman
with
a
heavy
tread
a
person
who
preferred
early
breakfasts
uncomfortable
chairs
and
the
of
the
had
arrived
the
week
before
and
was
awaiting
the
turn
of
events
she
was
a
widow
and
occupied
in
cornwall
a
house
nine
miles
from
a
station
which
had
to
make
up
for
this
inconvenience
as
she
had
once
told
nick
a
fine
old
herbaceous
garden
she
was
extremely
fond
of
an
herbaceous
garden
her
main
consciousness
was
of
herbaceous
possibilities
nick
had
often
seen
her
she
had
always
come
to
beauclere
once
or
twice
a
year
her
sojourn
there
made
no
great
difference
she
was
only
an
urania
dear
for
carteret
to
look
across
the
table
at
when
on
the
close
of
dinner
it
was
time
for
her
to
retire
she
went
out
of
the
room
always
as
if
it
were
after
some
one
else
and
on
the
gentlemen
joining
her
later
the
junction
was
not
very
close
she
received
them
with
an
air
of
gratified
surprise
chayter
honoured
nick
with
a
regard
which
approached
though
not
improperly
competing
with
it
the
affection
his
master
had
placed
on
the
same
young
head
and
chayter
knew
a
good
many
things
among
them
he
knew
his
place
but
it
was
wonderful
how
little
that
knowledge
had
rendered
him
inaccessible
to
other
kinds
he
took
upon
himself
to
send
for
nick
without
speaking
to
lendon
whose
influence
was
now
a
good
deal
like
that
of
some
large
occasional
piece
of
furniture
introduced
on
a
contingency
she
was
one
of
the
solid
conveniences
that
a
comfortable
house
would
have
but
you
could
talk
with
a
mahogany
sofa
or
a
folding
screen
chayter
knew
how
much
she
had
had
from
her
brother
and
how
much
her
two
daughters
had
each
received
on
marriage
and
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
it
was
quite
enough
especially
considering
the
society
in
which
they
you
could
scarcely
call
it
moved
he
knew
beyond
this
that
they
would
all
have
more
and
that
was
why
he
hesitated
little
about
communicating
with
nick
if
lendon
should
be
ruffled
at
the
intrusion
of
a
young
man
who
neither
was
the
child
of
a
cousin
nor
had
been
formally
adopted
chayter
was
parliamentary
enough
to
see
that
the
forms
of
debate
were
observed
he
had
indeed
a
slightly
compassionate
sense
that
lendon
was
not
easily
ruffled
she
was
always
down
an
extraordinary
time
before
breakfast
chayter
refused
to
take
it
as
in
the
least
admonitory
but
usually
went
straight
into
the
garden
as
if
to
see
that
none
of
the
plants
had
been
stolen
in
the
night
and
had
in
the
end
to
be
looked
for
by
the
footman
in
some
spot
behind
the
shrubbery
where
plumped
upon
the
ground
she
was
mostly
doing
something
rum
to
a
flower
carteret
himself
had
expressed
no
wishes
he
slept
most
of
the
time
his
failure
at
the
last
had
been
sudden
but
he
was
rheumatic
and
and
the
situation
was
in
chayter
hands
sir
matthew
hope
had
opined
even
on
a
second
visit
that
he
would
rally
and
go
on
in
rudimentary
comfort
some
time
longer
but
chayter
took
a
different
and
a
still
more
intimate
view
nick
was
embarrassed
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
was
there
for
from
the
moment
he
could
give
his
good
old
friend
no
conscious
satisfaction
the
doctors
the
nurses
the
servants
lendon
and
above
all
the
settled
equilibrium
of
the
square
thick
house
where
an
immutable
order
appeared
to
slant
through
the
polished
windows
and
tinkle
in
the
quieter
bells
all
these
things
represented
best
the
kind
of
supreme
solace
to
which
the
master
was
most
accessible
it
was
judged
best
that
for
the
first
day
nick
should
not
be
introduced
into
the
darkened
room
this
was
the
decision
of
the
two
decorous
nurses
of
whom
the
visitor
had
had
a
glimpse
and
who
with
their
black
uniforms
and
fresh
faces
of
business
suggested
the
barmaid
emulating
the
nun
he
was
depressed
and
restless
felt
himself
in
a
false
position
and
thought
it
lucky
lendon
had
powers
of
placid
acceptance
they
were
old
acquaintances
she
treated
him
formally
anxiously
but
it
was
not
the
rigour
of
mistrust
it
was
much
more
an
expression
of
remote
cornish
respect
for
young
abilities
and
distinguished
connexions
inasmuch
as
she
asked
him
rather
yearningly
about
lady
agnes
and
about
lady
flora
and
lady
elizabeth
he
knew
she
was
kind
and
ungrudging
and
his
main
regret
was
for
his
meagre
knowledge
and
poor
responses
in
regard
to
his
large
blank
aunts
he
sat
in
the
garden
with
newspapers
and
looked
at
the
lowered
blinds
in
carteret
windows
he
wandered
round
the
abbey
with
cigarettes
and
lightened
his
tread
and
felt
grave
wishing
everything
might
be
over
he
would
have
liked
much
to
see
carteret
again
but
had
no
desire
that
carteret
should
see
him
in
the
evening
he
dined
with
lendon
and
she
talked
to
him
at
his
request
and
as
much
as
she
could
about
her
brother
early
years
his
beginnings
of
life
she
was
so
much
younger
that
they
appeared
to
have
been
rather
a
tradition
of
her
own
youth
but
her
talk
made
nick
feel
how
tremendously
different
carteret
had
been
at
that
period
from
what
he
nick
was
he
had
published
at
the
age
of
thirty
a
little
volume
thought
at
the
time
wonderfully
clever
called
incidence
of
but
nick
had
not
yet
collected
the
material
for
any
such
treatise
after
dinner
lendon
who
was
in
merciless
full
dress
retired
to
the
where
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
she
was
followed
by
nick
who
had
remained
behind
only
because
he
thought
chayter
would
expect
it
lendon
almost
shook
hands
with
him
again
and
then
chayter
brought
in
coffee
almost
in
no
time
afterwards
he
brought
in
tea
and
the
occupants
of
the
sat
for
a
slow
during
which
the
lady
looked
round
at
the
apartment
with
a
sigh
and
said
do
you
think
poor
charles
had
exquisite
taste
fortunately
the
local
man
was
at
this
moment
ushered
in
he
had
been
upstairs
and
he
smiled
himself
in
with
the
remark
it
quite
wonderful
quite
wonderful
what
was
wonderful
was
a
marked
improvement
in
the
breathing
a
distinct
indication
of
revival
the
doctor
had
some
tea
and
chatted
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
a
way
that
showed
what
a
good
manner
and
how
large
an
experience
a
local
man
could
have
when
he
retired
nick
walked
out
with
him
the
doctor
house
was
near
by
and
he
had
come
on
foot
he
left
the
visitor
with
the
assurance
that
in
all
probability
carteret
who
was
certainly
picking
up
would
be
able
to
see
him
on
the
morrow
our
young
man
turned
his
steps
again
to
the
abbey
and
took
a
stroll
about
it
in
the
starlight
it
never
looked
so
huge
as
when
it
reared
itself
into
the
night
and
nick
had
never
felt
more
fond
of
it
than
on
this
occasion
more
comforted
and
confirmed
by
its
beauty
when
he
came
back
he
was
readmitted
by
chayter
who
surveyed
him
in
respectful
deprecation
of
the
frivolity
which
had
led
him
to
attempt
to
help
himself
through
such
an
evening
in
such
a
way
he
went
to
bed
early
and
slept
badly
which
was
unusual
with
him
but
it
was
a
pleasure
to
him
to
be
told
almost
as
soon
as
he
appeared
that
carteret
had
asked
for
him
he
went
in
to
see
him
and
was
struck
with
the
change
in
his
appearance
he
had
however
spent
a
day
with
him
just
after
the
new
year
and
another
at
the
beginning
of
march
and
had
then
noted
in
him
the
menace
of
the
final
weakness
a
week
after
julia
dallow
departure
for
the
continent
he
had
again
devoted
several
hours
to
the
place
and
to
the
intention
of
telling
his
old
friend
how
the
happy
event
had
been
brought
to
naught
the
advantage
he
had
been
so
good
as
to
desire
for
him
and
to
make
the
condition
of
a
splendid
gift
before
this
for
a
few
days
he
had
been
keeping
back
to
announce
it
personally
the
good
news
that
julia
had
at
last
set
their
situation
in
order
he
wanted
to
enjoy
the
old
man
pleasure
so
sore
a
trial
had
her
arbitrary
behaviour
been
for
a
year
if
she
had
offered
carteret
a
conciliatory
visit
before
christmas
had
come
down
from
london
one
day
to
lunch
with
him
this
had
but
contributed
to
make
him
subsequently
exhibit
to
poor
nick
as
the
victim
of
her
elegant
perversity
a
great
deal
of
earnest
commiseration
in
a
jocose
form
upon
his
honour
as
he
said
she
was
as
clever
and
specious
a
woman
this
was
his
odd
expression
as
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
the
merit
of
her
behaviour
on
that
occasion
as
nick
knew
was
that
she
had
not
been
specious
at
her
lover
expense
she
had
breathed
no
doubt
of
his
public
purpose
and
had
had
the
strange
grace
to
say
that
in
truth
she
was
older
than
he
so
that
it
was
only
fair
to
give
his
affections
time
to
mature
but
when
nick
saw
their
hopeful
host
after
the
rupture
at
which
we
have
been
present
he
found
him
in
no
state
to
deal
with
worries
he
was
seriously
ailing
it
was
the
beginning
of
worse
things
and
not
a
time
to
put
his
attention
to
the
stretch
after
this
excursion
nick
had
gone
back
to
town
saddened
by
his
patient
now
unmistakably
settled
decline
but
rather
relieved
that
he
had
had
himself
to
make
no
confession
it
had
even
occurred
to
him
that
the
need
for
making
one
at
all
might
never
come
up
certainly
it
would
if
the
ebb
of
carteret
strength
should
continue
unchecked
he
might
pass
away
in
the
persuasion
that
everything
would
happen
as
he
wished
it
though
indeed
without
enriching
nick
on
his
to
the
tune
he
had
promised
very
likely
he
had
made
legal
arrangements
in
virtue
of
which
his
bounty
would
take
effect
in
case
of
the
right
event
and
in
that
case
alone
at
present
nick
had
a
bigger
an
uglier
truth
to
tell
the
last
three
days
had
made
the
difference
but
oddly
enough
though
his
responsibility
had
increased
his
reluctance
to
speak
had
vanished
he
was
positively
eager
to
clear
up
a
situation
over
which
it
was
not
consistent
with
his
honour
to
leave
a
shade
the
doctor
had
been
right
on
coming
in
after
dinner
it
was
clear
in
the
morning
that
they
had
not
seen
the
last
of
carteret
power
of
picking
up
chayter
who
had
waited
on
him
refused
austerely
to
change
his
opinion
with
every
change
in
his
master
temperature
but
the
nurses
took
the
cheering
view
that
it
would
do
their
charge
good
for
dormer
to
sit
with
him
a
little
one
of
them
remained
in
the
room
in
the
deep
and
nick
spent
twenty
minutes
by
the
bedside
it
was
not
a
case
for
much
conversation
but
his
helpless
host
seemed
still
to
like
to
look
at
him
there
was
life
in
his
kind
old
eyes
a
stir
of
something
that
would
express
itself
yet
in
some
further
wise
provision
he
laid
his
liberal
hand
on
nick
with
a
confidence
that
showed
how
little
it
was
really
disabled
he
said
very
little
and
the
nurse
had
recommended
that
the
visitor
himself
should
not
overflow
in
speech
but
from
time
to
time
he
murmured
with
a
faint
smile
division
you
know
you
must
miss
it
there
was
probably
to
be
no
division
that
night
as
happened
but
even
carteret
aberrations
were
parliamentary
before
nick
withdrew
he
had
been
able
to
assure
him
he
was
rapidly
getting
better
and
that
such
valuable
hours
the
young
own
must
be
wasted
come
back
on
friday
if
they
come
to
the
second
reading
these
were
the
words
with
which
nick
was
dismissed
and
at
noon
the
doctor
said
the
invalid
was
doing
very
well
but
that
nick
had
better
leave
him
quiet
for
that
day
our
young
man
accordingly
determined
to
go
up
to
town
for
the
night
and
even
should
he
receive
no
summons
for
the
next
day
he
arranged
with
chayter
that
he
should
be
telegraphed
to
if
carteret
were
either
better
or
worse
oh
he
ca
very
well
be
worse
sir
chayter
replied
inexorably
but
he
relaxed
so
far
as
to
remark
that
of
course
it
would
do
for
nick
to
neglect
the
house
oh
the
house
nick
was
ambiguous
and
avoided
the
butler
eye
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
tell
carteret
but
nothing
would
have
sustained
him
in
the
effort
to
make
a
clean
breast
to
chayter
he
might
equivocate
about
the
house
but
he
had
the
sense
of
things
to
be
done
awaiting
him
in
london
he
telegraphed
to
his
servant
and
spent
that
night
in
rosedale
road
the
things
to
be
done
were
apparently
to
be
done
in
his
studio
his
servant
met
him
there
with
a
large
bundle
of
letters
he
failed
that
evening
to
stray
within
two
miles
of
westminster
and
the
legislature
of
his
country
reassembled
without
his
support
the
next
morning
he
received
a
telegram
from
chayter
to
whom
he
had
given
rosedale
road
as
an
address
this
missive
simply
informed
him
that
carteret
wished
to
see
him
it
seemed
a
sign
that
he
was
better
though
chayter
would
say
so
nick
again
accordingly
took
his
place
in
the
train
to
beauclere
he
had
been
there
very
often
but
it
was
present
to
him
that
now
after
a
little
he
should
go
only
once
more
for
a
particular
dismal
occasion
all
that
was
over
everything
that
belonged
to
it
was
over
he
learned
on
his
arrival
he
saw
lendon
immediately
that
his
old
friend
had
continued
to
pick
up
he
had
expressed
a
strong
and
a
perfectly
rational
desire
to
talk
with
his
expected
visitor
and
the
doctor
had
said
that
if
it
was
about
anything
important
they
should
forbear
to
oppose
him
he
says
it
about
something
very
important
lendon
remarked
resting
shy
eyes
on
him
while
she
added
that
she
herself
was
now
sitting
with
her
dear
brother
she
had
sent
those
wonderful
young
ladies
out
to
see
the
abbey
nick
paused
with
her
outside
carteret
door
he
wanted
to
say
something
rather
intimate
and
all
soothing
to
her
in
return
for
her
homely
charity
give
her
a
hint
for
which
she
was
far
from
looking
that
practically
he
had
now
no
interest
in
her
brother
estate
this
was
of
course
impossible
her
lack
of
irony
of
play
of
mind
gave
him
no
pretext
and
such
a
reference
would
be
an
insult
to
her
simple
discretion
she
was
either
not
thinking
of
his
interest
at
all
or
was
thinking
of
it
with
the
tolerance
of
a
nature
trained
to
a
hundred
decent
submissions
nick
looked
a
little
into
her
mild
uninvestigating
eyes
and
it
came
over
him
supremely
that
the
goodness
of
these
people
was
singularly
pure
they
were
a
part
of
what
was
cleanest
and
sanest
and
dullest
in
humanity
there
had
been
just
a
little
mocking
inflexion
in
lendon
pleasant
voice
but
it
was
dedicated
to
the
young
ladies
in
the
black
uniforms
she
could
perhaps
be
humorous
about
and
not
to
the
theory
of
the
importance
of
nick
interview
with
her
brother
his
arrested
desire
to
let
her
know
he
was
not
greedy
translated
itself
into
a
vague
friendliness
and
into
the
abrupt
rather
bewildering
words
i
ca
tell
you
half
the
good
i
think
of
you
as
he
passed
into
carteret
room
it
occurred
to
him
that
she
would
perhaps
interpret
this
speech
as
an
acknowledgment
of
obligation
of
her
good
nature
in
not
keeping
him
away
from
the
rich
old
man
xxxiii
the
rich
old
man
was
propped
up
on
pillows
and
in
this
attitude
beneath
the
high
spare
canopy
of
his
bed
presented
himself
to
vision
as
a
figure
in
a
clever
composition
or
a
story
he
had
gathered
strength
though
this
strength
was
not
much
in
his
voice
it
was
mainly
in
his
brighter
eyes
and
his
air
of
being
pleased
with
himself
he
put
out
his
hand
and
said
i
daresay
you
know
why
i
sent
for
you
on
which
nick
sank
into
the
seat
he
had
occupied
the
day
before
replying
that
he
had
been
delighted
to
come
whatever
the
reason
carteret
said
nothing
more
about
the
division
or
the
second
reading
he
only
murmured
that
they
were
keeping
the
newspapers
for
him
i
rather
behind
i
rather
behind
he
went
on
but
two
or
three
quiet
mornings
will
make
it
all
right
you
can
go
back
you
know
you
can
easily
go
back
this
was
the
only
thing
not
quite
straight
that
nick
found
in
him
his
making
light
of
his
young
flying
to
and
fro
the
young
friend
sat
looking
at
him
with
a
sense
that
was
half
compunction
and
half
the
idea
of
the
rare
beauty
of
his
face
to
which
strangely
the
waste
of
illness
now
seemed
to
have
restored
something
of
its
youth
carteret
was
evidently
conscious
that
this
morning
he
should
be
able
to
go
on
long
so
that
he
must
be
practical
and
concise
i
daresay
you
know
you
only
to
remember
he
continued
i
need
tell
you
what
a
pleasure
it
is
to
me
to
see
you
there
can
be
no
better
reason
than
that
was
what
nick
could
say
has
the
year
come
round
the
year
of
that
foolish
arrangement
nick
thought
a
little
asking
himself
if
it
were
really
necessary
to
disturb
his
companion
earnest
faith
then
the
consciousness
of
the
falsity
of
his
own
position
surged
over
him
again
and
he
replied
do
you
mean
the
period
for
which
dallow
insisted
on
keeping
me
dangling
oh
over
he
almost
gaily
brought
out
and
are
you
married
has
it
come
off
the
old
man
asked
eagerly
how
long
have
i
been
ill
we
uncomfortable
unreasonable
people
not
deserving
of
your
interest
we
not
married
nick
said
then
i
have
been
ill
so
long
his
host
quavered
with
vague
relief
not
very
long
but
things
different
he
went
on
the
old
man
eyes
rested
on
his
he
noted
how
much
larger
they
appeared
you
mean
the
arrangements
are
made
the
day
at
hand
there
are
no
arrangements
nick
smiled
but
why
should
it
trouble
you
what
then
will
you
do
without
arrangements
the
inquiry
was
plaintive
and
childlike
we
shall
do
nothing
there
nothing
to
be
done
we
not
to
be
married
it
all
off
said
poor
nick
then
he
added
dallow
has
gone
abroad
the
old
man
motionless
among
his
pillows
gave
a
long
groan
ah
i
do
like
that
no
more
do
i
sir
what
the
matter
it
was
so
good
so
good
it
was
good
enough
for
julia
nick
declared
for
julia
is
julia
so
great
as
that
she
told
me
she
had
the
greatest
regard
for
you
you
good
enough
for
the
best
my
dear
boy
carteret
pursued
you
do
know
me
i
disappointing
she
had
i
believe
a
great
regard
for
me
but
i
forfeited
her
good
opinion
the
old
man
stared
at
this
cynical
announcement
he
searched
his
visitor
face
for
some
attenuation
of
the
words
but
nick
apparently
struck
him
as
unashamed
and
a
faint
colour
coming
into
his
withered
cheek
indicated
his
mystification
and
alarm
have
you
been
unfaithful
to
her
he
still
considerately
asked
she
thinks
so
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
as
i
told
you
a
year
ago
she
does
believe
in
me
you
ought
to
have
made
her
you
ought
to
have
made
her
said
carteret
nick
was
about
to
plead
some
reason
when
he
continued
do
you
remember
what
i
told
you
i
give
you
if
you
did
do
you
remember
what
i
told
you
i
give
you
on
your
you
expressed
the
most
generous
intentions
and
i
remember
them
as
much
as
a
man
may
do
who
has
no
wish
to
remind
you
of
them
the
money
there
i
put
it
aside
i
have
earned
it
i
have
earned
a
penny
of
it
give
it
to
those
who
deserve
it
more
said
nick
i
do
understand
i
do
understand
carteret
whimpered
the
tears
of
weakness
in
his
eyes
his
face
flushed
and
he
added
i
not
good
for
much
discussion
i
very
much
disappointed
i
think
i
may
say
it
not
my
fault
i
done
what
i
can
nick
declared
but
when
people
are
in
love
they
do
more
than
that
oh
it
all
over
said
our
young
man
not
caring
much
now
for
the
moment
how
disconcerted
his
companion
might
be
so
long
as
he
disabused
him
of
the
idea
that
they
were
partners
to
a
bargain
we
tormented
each
other
and
we
tormented
you
and
that
all
that
has
come
of
it
his
companion
eyes
seemed
to
stare
at
strange
things
do
you
care
for
what
i
have
done
for
you
should
you
have
liked
it
of
course
one
likes
kindness
one
likes
money
but
it
all
over
nick
repeated
then
he
added
i
fatigue
you
i
knock
you
up
with
telling
you
these
troubles
i
only
do
so
because
it
seems
to
me
right
you
should
know
but
do
be
worried
everything
for
the
best
he
patted
the
pale
hand
reassuringly
inclined
himself
affectionately
but
carteret
was
not
easily
soothed
he
had
practised
lucidity
all
his
life
had
expected
it
of
others
and
had
never
given
his
assent
to
an
indistinct
proposition
he
was
weak
yet
not
too
weak
to
recognise
that
he
had
formed
a
calculation
now
vitiated
by
a
wrong
factor
put
his
name
to
a
contract
of
which
the
other
side
had
not
been
carried
out
more
than
fifty
years
of
conscious
success
pressed
him
to
try
to
understand
he
had
never
muddled
his
affairs
and
he
could
muddle
them
now
at
the
same
time
he
was
aware
of
the
necessity
of
economising
his
effort
and
he
would
gather
that
inward
force
patiently
and
almost
cunningly
for
the
right
question
and
the
right
induction
he
was
still
able
to
make
his
agitation
reflective
and
it
could
still
consort
with
his
high
hopes
of
nick
that
he
should
find
himself
regarding
mere
vague
verbal
comfort
words
in
the
air
as
an
inadequate
guarantee
so
after
he
had
attached
his
dim
vision
to
his
young
friend
face
a
moment
he
brought
out
have
you
done
anything
bad
nothing
worse
than
usual
nick
laughed
ah
everything
should
have
been
better
than
usual
well
it
has
been
that
that
i
must
say
do
you
sometimes
think
of
your
father
carteret
continued
nick
had
a
decent
pause
make
me
think
of
him
you
always
that
pleasant
effect
his
name
would
have
lived
it
must
be
lost
yes
but
the
competition
is
terrible
nick
returned
his
host
considered
this
as
if
he
found
a
serious
flaw
in
it
after
which
he
began
again
i
never
supposed
you
a
trifler
i
determined
not
to
be
i
thought
her
charming
do
you
love
mrs
dallow
carteret
profoundly
asked
do
put
it
to
me
so
for
i
feel
sore
and
injured
i
think
she
has
treated
me
well
you
should
have
held
her
you
should
have
let
her
go
the
old
man
returned
with
unexpected
fire
his
visitor
flushed
at
this
so
strange
was
it
to
receive
a
lesson
in
energy
from
a
dying
octogenarian
yet
after
an
instant
nick
answered
with
due
modesty
i
have
been
clever
enough
no
doubt
do
say
that
do
say
that
carteret
shrunk
from
the
thought
do
think
i
can
allow
you
any
of
that
sort
i
know
how
well
you
done
you
taking
your
place
several
gentlemen
have
told
me
has
she
felt
a
scruple
knowing
my
settlement
on
you
to
depend
he
pursued
oh
she
has
known
has
known
anything
about
it
i
do
understand
though
i
think
you
explained
somewhat
a
year
ago
the
poor
gentleman
gave
it
up
i
think
she
wanted
to
speak
to
me
of
any
intentions
i
might
have
in
regard
to
you
the
day
she
was
here
very
nicely
very
properly
she
have
done
it
i
sure
i
think
her
idea
was
that
i
ought
to
make
any
settlement
quite
independent
of
your
marrying
her
or
not
marrying
her
but
i
tried
to
convey
to
her
i
do
know
whether
she
understood
me
that
i
liked
her
too
much
for
that
i
wanted
too
much
to
make
sure
of
her
to
make
sure
of
me
you
mean
said
nick
and
now
after
all
you
see
you
have
well
perhaps
it
was
that
sighed
the
old
man
confusedly
all
this
is
very
bad
for
you
we
talk
again
nick
urged
no
no
let
us
finish
it
now
i
like
to
know
what
i
doing
i
shall
rest
better
when
i
do
know
there
are
great
things
to
be
done
the
future
will
be
full
the
future
will
be
fine
carteret
wandered
let
me
be
distinct
about
this
for
julia
that
if
we
had
been
sundered
her
generosity
to
me
would
have
been
complete
she
have
put
her
great
fortune
absolutely
at
my
disposal
nick
said
after
a
moment
her
consciousness
of
all
that
naturally
carries
her
over
any
particular
distress
in
regard
to
what
wo
come
to
me
now
from
another
source
ah
do
lose
it
the
old
man
painfully
pleaded
it
in
your
hands
sir
nick
returned
i
mean
dallow
fortune
it
will
be
of
the
highest
utility
that
was
what
your
father
missed
i
shall
miss
more
than
my
father
did
said
nick
shell
come
back
to
you
i
ca
look
at
you
and
doubt
that
nick
smiled
with
a
slow
headshake
never
never
never
you
look
at
me
my
grand
old
friend
but
you
do
see
me
i
not
what
you
think
what
is
it
what
is
it
you
been
bad
carteret
panted
no
no
i
not
bad
but
i
different
different
different
from
my
father
different
from
dallow
different
from
you
ah
why
do
you
perplex
me
the
old
man
moaned
you
done
something
i
do
want
to
perplex
you
but
i
have
done
something
said
nick
getting
up
he
had
heard
the
door
open
softly
behind
him
and
lendon
come
forward
with
precautions
what
has
he
done
what
has
he
done
quavered
carteret
to
his
sister
she
however
after
a
glance
at
the
patient
motioned
their
young
friend
away
and
bending
over
the
bed
replied
in
a
voice
expressive
at
that
moment
of
an
ample
provision
of
vital
comfort
he
has
only
excited
you
i
afraid
a
little
more
than
is
good
for
you
is
your
dear
old
head
a
little
too
high
nick
regarded
himself
as
justly
banished
and
he
quitted
the
room
with
a
ready
acquiescence
in
any
power
to
carry
on
the
scene
of
which
lendon
might
find
herself
possessed
he
felt
distinctly
brutal
as
he
heard
his
host
emit
a
weak
exhalation
of
assent
to
some
change
of
position
but
he
would
have
reproached
himself
more
if
he
had
wished
less
to
guard
against
the
acceptance
of
an
equivalent
for
duties
unperformed
carteret
had
had
in
his
mind
characteristically
the
idea
of
a
fine
high
contract
and
there
was
something
more
to
be
said
about
that
nick
went
out
of
the
house
and
stayed
away
for
two
or
three
hours
quite
ready
to
regard
the
place
as
quieter
and
safer
without
him
he
haunted
the
abbey
as
usual
and
sat
a
long
time
in
its
simplifying
stillness
turning
over
many
things
he
came
back
again
at
the
through
the
garden
and
heard
somewhat
to
his
surprise
and
greatly
to
his
relief
that
his
host
had
composed
himself
promptly
enough
after
their
agitating
interview
lendon
talked
at
luncheon
much
as
if
she
expected
her
brother
to
be
as
she
said
really
quite
fit
again
she
asked
nick
no
awkward
question
which
was
uncommonly
good
of
her
he
thought
considering
that
she
might
have
said
what
in
the
world
were
you
trying
to
get
out
of
him
she
only
reported
to
our
young
man
that
the
invalid
had
every
hope
of
a
short
interview
about
seven
a
short
one
this
gentle
emphasis
was
lendon
single
tribute
to
the
critical
spirit
nick
divined
that
carteret
desire
for
further
explanations
was
really
strong
and
had
been
capable
of
sustaining
him
through
a
bad
morning
capable
even
of
helping
him
it
would
have
been
a
secret
and
wonderful
momentary
conquest
of
weakness
to
pass
it
off
for
a
good
one
he
wished
he
might
make
a
sketch
of
him
from
the
life
as
he
had
seen
him
after
breakfast
he
had
a
conviction
he
could
make
a
strong
one
which
would
be
a
precious
memento
but
he
shrank
from
proposing
this
the
dear
man
might
think
it
unparliamentary
the
doctor
had
called
while
nick
was
out
and
he
came
again
at
five
without
that
inmate
seeing
him
the
latter
was
busy
in
his
room
at
that
hour
he
wrote
a
short
letter
which
took
him
a
long
time
but
apparently
there
had
been
no
veto
on
a
resumption
of
talk
for
at
seven
his
friend
sent
for
him
the
nurse
at
the
door
said
only
a
moment
i
hope
sir
but
took
him
in
and
then
withdrew
the
prolonged
daylight
was
in
the
room
and
its
occupant
again
established
on
his
pile
of
pillows
but
with
his
head
a
little
lower
nick
sat
down
by
him
and
expressed
the
hope
of
not
having
upset
him
in
the
morning
but
the
old
man
with
fixed
enlarged
eyes
took
up
their
conversation
exactly
where
they
had
left
it
what
have
you
done
what
have
you
done
have
you
associated
yourself
with
some
other
woman
no
no
i
do
think
she
can
accuse
me
of
that
well
then
she
come
back
to
you
if
you
take
the
right
way
with
her
it
might
have
been
droll
to
hear
the
poor
gentleman
in
his
situation
give
his
views
on
the
right
way
with
women
but
nick
was
not
moved
to
enjoy
that
diversion
i
taken
the
wrong
way
i
done
something
that
must
spoil
my
prospects
in
that
direction
for
ever
i
written
a
letter
the
visitor
went
on
but
his
companion
had
already
interrupted
him
you
written
a
letter
to
my
constituents
informing
them
of
my
determination
to
resign
my
seat
to
resign
your
seat
i
made
up
my
mind
after
no
end
of
reflexion
dear
carteret
to
work
on
quite
other
lines
i
a
plan
of
becoming
a
painter
so
given
up
the
idea
of
a
political
life
a
painter
carteret
seemed
to
turn
whiter
i
going
in
for
the
portrait
in
oils
it
sounds
absurd
i
know
and
i
thus
specific
only
to
show
you
i
do
in
the
least
expect
you
to
count
on
me
the
invalid
had
continued
to
stare
at
first
then
his
eyes
slowly
closed
and
he
lay
motionless
and
blank
do
let
it
trouble
you
now
it
a
long
story
and
rather
a
poor
one
when
you
get
better
i
tell
you
all
about
it
well
talk
it
over
amicably
and
i
bring
you
to
my
view
nick
went
on
hypocritically
he
had
laid
his
hand
again
on
the
hand
beside
him
it
felt
cold
and
as
the
old
man
remained
silent
he
had
a
moment
of
exaggerated
fear
this
is
dreadful
news
and
carteret
opened
his
eyes
certainly
it
must
seem
so
to
you
for
i
always
kept
from
you
i
was
ashamed
and
my
present
confusion
is
a
just
chastisement
the
great
interest
i
have
always
taken
in
the
but
nick
broke
down
with
a
gasp
to
add
presently
with
an
intention
of
the
pleasant
and
a
sense
of
the
foolish
in
the
pencil
and
the
brush
he
spoke
of
his
current
confusion
though
his
manner
might
have
been
thought
to
show
it
but
little
he
was
himself
surprised
at
his
brazen
assurance
and
had
to
recognise
that
at
the
point
things
had
come
to
now
he
was
profoundly
obstinate
and
quiet
the
pencil
the
brush
they
not
the
weapons
of
a
gentleman
carteret
pronounced
i
was
sure
that
would
be
your
feeling
i
repeat
that
i
mention
them
only
because
you
once
said
you
intended
to
do
something
for
me
as
the
phrase
is
and
i
thought
you
ought
to
do
it
in
ignorance
my
ignorance
was
better
such
knowledge
is
good
for
me
forgive
me
my
dear
old
friend
nick
kept
it
bravely
up
when
better
you
see
it
differently
i
shall
never
be
better
now
ah
no
nick
insisted
it
will
really
do
you
good
after
a
little
think
it
over
quietly
and
you
be
glad
i
stopped
humbugging
i
loved
you
i
loved
you
as
my
son
the
old
man
wailed
he
sank
on
his
knee
beside
the
bed
and
leaned
over
him
tenderly
get
better
get
better
and
i
be
your
son
for
the
rest
of
your
life
poor
dormer
poor
dormer
carteret
continued
to
lament
i
admit
that
if
he
had
lived
i
probably
should
have
done
it
said
nick
i
daresay
i
should
have
deferred
to
his
prejudices
even
though
thinking
them
narrow
do
you
turn
against
your
father
his
host
asked
making
to
disengage
his
arm
from
the
young
man
touch
an
effort
betraying
the
irritation
of
conscious
weakness
nick
got
up
at
this
and
stood
a
moment
looking
down
at
him
while
he
went
on
do
you
give
up
your
name
do
you
give
up
your
country
if
i
do
something
good
my
country
may
like
it
nick
spoke
as
if
he
had
thought
that
out
do
you
regard
them
as
equal
the
two
glories
here
comes
your
nurse
to
blow
me
up
and
turn
me
out
said
nick
the
nurse
had
come
in
but
carteret
directed
to
her
an
audible
dry
courteous
be
so
good
as
to
wait
till
i
send
for
you
which
arrested
her
in
the
large
room
at
some
distance
from
the
bed
and
then
had
the
effect
of
making
her
turn
on
her
heel
with
a
professional
laugh
she
clearly
judged
that
an
old
gentleman
with
the
fine
manner
of
his
prime
might
still
be
trusted
to
take
care
of
himself
when
she
had
gone
that
personage
addressed
to
his
visitor
the
question
for
which
his
deep
displeasure
lent
him
strength
do
you
pretend
there
a
nobler
life
than
a
high
political
career
i
think
the
noble
life
doing
one
work
well
one
can
do
it
very
ill
and
be
very
base
and
mean
in
what
you
call
a
high
political
career
i
have
been
in
the
house
so
many
months
without
finding
that
out
it
contains
some
very
small
souls
you
should
stand
against
them
you
should
expose
them
stammered
carteret
stand
against
them
against
one
own
party
the
old
man
contended
a
moment
with
this
and
then
broke
out
god
forgive
you
are
you
a
tory
are
you
a
tory
how
little
you
understand
me
laughed
nick
with
a
ring
of
bitterness
little
enough
little
enough
my
boy
have
you
sent
your
electors
your
dreadful
letter
not
yet
but
it
all
ready
and
i
sha
change
my
mind
you
will
you
will
you
think
better
of
it
you
see
your
duty
said
the
invalid
almost
coaxingly
that
seems
very
improbable
for
my
determination
crudely
and
abruptly
as
to
my
great
regret
it
comes
to
you
here
is
the
fruit
of
a
long
and
painful
struggle
the
difficulty
is
that
i
see
my
duty
just
in
this
other
effort
an
effort
do
you
call
it
an
effort
to
fall
away
to
sink
far
down
to
give
up
every
effort
what
does
your
mother
say
heaven
help
her
carteret
went
on
before
nick
could
answer
the
other
question
i
have
told
her
yet
you
ashamed
you
ashamed
nick
only
looked
out
of
the
west
window
now
he
felt
his
ears
turn
hot
tell
her
it
would
have
been
sixty
thousand
i
had
the
money
all
ready
i
sha
tell
her
that
said
nick
redder
still
poor
woman
poor
dear
woman
carteret
woefully
cried
yes
indeed
she
wo
like
it
think
it
all
over
again
do
throw
away
a
splendid
future
these
words
were
uttered
with
a
final
flicker
of
passion
nick
had
never
heard
such
an
accent
on
his
old
friend
lips
but
he
next
began
to
murmur
i
tired
i
very
tired
and
sank
back
with
a
groan
and
with
closed
lips
his
guest
gently
assured
him
that
he
had
but
too
much
cause
to
be
exhausted
and
that
the
worst
was
over
now
he
smoothed
his
pillows
for
him
and
said
he
must
leave
him
would
send
in
the
nurse
come
back
come
back
carteret
pleaded
against
that
come
back
and
tell
me
it
a
horrible
dream
nick
did
go
back
very
late
that
evening
his
host
had
sent
a
message
to
his
room
but
one
of
the
nurses
was
on
the
ground
this
time
and
made
good
her
opposition
watch
in
hand
the
was
shrouded
and
darkened
the
shaded
candle
left
the
bed
in
gloom
nick
interview
with
his
venerable
friend
was
the
affair
of
but
a
moment
the
nurse
interposed
impatient
and
not
understanding
she
heard
nick
say
that
he
had
posted
his
letter
now
and
their
companion
flash
out
with
an
acerbity
still
savouring
of
the
sordid
associations
of
a
world
he
had
not
done
with
then
of
course
my
settlement
does
take
effect
oh
that
all
right
nick
answered
kindly
and
he
went
off
next
morning
by
the
early
train
his
injured
host
was
still
sleeping
lendon
habits
made
it
easy
for
her
to
be
present
in
matutinal
bloom
at
the
young
man
hasty
breakfast
and
she
sent
a
particular
remembrance
to
lady
agnes
and
when
he
should
see
them
to
the
ladies
flora
and
elizabeth
nick
had
a
prevision
of
the
spirit
in
which
his
mother
at
least
would
now
receive
hollow
compliments
from
beauclere
the
night
before
as
soon
as
he
had
quitted
carteret
the
old
man
said
to
the
nurse
that
he
wished
chayter
instructed
to
go
and
fetch
mitton
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
mitton
was
the
leading
solicitor
at
beauclere
xxxiv
the
really
formidable
thing
for
nick
had
been
to
tell
his
mother
a
truth
of
which
he
was
so
conscious
that
he
had
the
matter
out
with
her
the
very
morning
he
returned
from
beauclere
she
and
grace
had
come
back
the
afternoon
before
from
their
own
enjoyment
of
rural
hospitality
and
knowing
this
she
had
written
him
her
intention
from
the
country
he
drove
straight
from
the
station
to
calcutta
gardens
there
was
a
little
room
on
the
right
of
the
known
as
his
own
room
but
in
which
of
a
morning
when
he
was
not
at
home
lady
agnes
sometimes
wrote
her
letters
these
were
always
numerous
and
when
she
heard
our
young
cab
she
happened
to
be
engaged
with
them
at
the
big
bureau
that
had
belonged
to
his
father
where
amid
a
margin
of
works
of
political
reference
she
seemed
to
herself
to
make
public
affairs
feel
the
point
of
her
elbow
she
came
into
the
hall
to
meet
her
son
and
to
hear
about
their
benefactor
and
nick
went
straight
back
into
the
room
with
her
and
closed
the
door
it
would
be
in
the
evening
paper
and
she
would
see
it
and
he
had
no
right
to
allow
her
to
wait
for
that
it
proved
indeed
a
terrible
hour
and
when
ten
minutes
later
grace
who
had
learned
upstairs
her
brother
return
went
down
for
further
news
of
him
she
heard
from
the
hall
a
sound
of
voices
that
made
her
first
pause
and
then
retrace
her
steps
on
tiptoe
she
mounted
to
the
and
crept
about
there
palpitating
looking
at
moments
into
the
dull
street
and
wondering
what
on
earth
had
taken
place
she
had
no
one
to
express
her
wonder
to
for
florence
tressilian
had
departed
and
biddy
after
breakfast
betaken
herself
in
accordance
with
a
custom
now
inveterate
to
rosedale
road
her
mother
was
unmistakably
and
passionately
crying
a
fact
tremendous
in
its
significance
for
lady
agnes
had
not
often
been
brought
so
low
nick
had
seen
her
cry
but
this
almost
awful
spectacle
had
seldom
been
offered
to
grace
and
it
now
convinced
her
that
some
dreadful
thing
had
happened
that
was
of
course
in
order
after
nick
mysterious
quarrel
with
julia
which
had
made
his
mother
so
ill
and
was
at
present
followed
up
with
new
horrors
the
row
as
grace
mentally
phrased
it
had
had
something
to
do
with
the
rupture
of
the
lovers
some
deeper
depth
of
disappointment
had
begun
to
yawn
grace
asked
herself
if
they
were
talking
about
broadwood
if
nick
had
demanded
that
in
the
conditions
so
unpleasantly
altered
lady
agnes
should
restore
that
awfully
nice
house
to
its
owner
this
was
very
possible
but
why
should
he
so
suddenly
have
broken
out
about
it
and
moreover
their
mother
though
sore
to
bleeding
about
the
whole
business
for
broadwood
in
its
fresh
comfort
was
too
delightful
would
have
met
this
pretension
with
tears
had
she
already
so
perversely
declared
that
they
could
decently
continue
to
make
use
of
the
place
julia
had
said
that
of
course
they
must
go
on
but
lady
agnes
was
prepared
with
an
effective
rejoinder
to
that
it
did
consist
of
words
it
was
to
be
austerely
practical
was
to
consist
of
letting
julia
see
at
the
moment
she
should
least
expect
it
that
they
quite
would
go
on
lady
agnes
was
ostensibly
waiting
for
this
moment
the
moment
when
her
renunciation
would
be
most
impressive
grace
was
conscious
of
how
she
had
for
many
days
been
moving
with
her
mother
in
darkness
deeply
stricken
by
nick
culpable
oh
he
was
culpable
loss
of
his
prize
but
feeling
an
obscure
element
in
the
matter
they
did
grasp
an
undiscovered
explanation
that
would
perhaps
make
it
still
worse
though
it
might
make
poor
things
a
little
better
he
had
explained
nothing
he
had
simply
said
dear
mother
we
do
hit
it
off
after
all
it
an
awful
bore
but
we
do
as
if
that
were
in
the
dire
conditions
an
adequate
balm
for
two
aching
hearts
from
julia
naturally
no
flood
of
light
was
to
be
looked
for
julia
humoured
curiosity
and
though
she
very
often
did
the
thing
you
would
suppose
she
was
not
unexpectedly
apologetic
in
this
case
grace
recognised
that
in
such
a
position
it
would
savour
of
apology
for
her
to
disclose
to
lady
agnes
her
grounds
for
having
let
nick
off
and
she
would
have
liked
to
be
the
person
to
suggest
to
julia
that
any
one
looked
for
anything
from
her
neither
of
the
disunited
pair
blamed
the
other
or
cast
an
aspersion
and
it
was
all
very
magnanimous
and
superior
and
impenetrable
and
exasperating
with
all
this
grace
had
a
suspicion
that
biddy
knew
something
more
that
for
biddy
the
tormenting
curtain
had
been
lifted
biddy
had
come
and
gone
in
these
days
with
a
perceptible
air
of
detachment
from
the
tribulations
of
home
it
had
made
her
fortunately
very
pretty
still
prettier
than
usual
it
sometimes
happened
that
at
moments
when
grace
was
most
angry
she
had
a
faint
sweet
smile
which
might
have
been
drawn
from
some
source
of
occult
consolation
it
was
perhaps
in
some
degree
connected
with
peter
sherringham
visit
as
to
which
the
girl
had
not
been
superstitiously
silent
when
grace
asked
her
if
she
had
secret
information
and
if
it
pointed
to
the
idea
that
everything
would
be
all
right
in
the
end
she
pretended
to
know
nothing
what
should
she
know
she
asked
with
the
loveliest
arch
of
eyebrows
over
an
unblinking
candour
and
begged
her
sister
not
to
let
lady
agnes
believe
her
better
off
than
themselves
she
contributed
nothing
to
their
gropings
save
a
much
better
patience
but
she
went
with
noticeable
regularity
on
the
pretext
of
her
foolish
modelling
to
rosedale
road
she
was
frankly
on
nick
side
not
going
so
far
as
to
say
he
had
been
right
but
saying
distinctly
how
sure
she
was
that
whatever
had
happened
he
could
have
helped
it
not
a
mite
this
was
striking
because
as
grace
knew
the
younger
of
the
sisters
had
been
much
favoured
by
julia
and
would
have
sacrificed
her
easily
it
associated
itself
in
the
irritated
mind
of
the
elder
with
frequent
visits
to
the
studio
and
made
miss
dormer
ask
herself
if
the
crisis
in
nick
and
julia
business
had
not
somehow
been
linked
to
that
unnatural
spot
she
had
gone
there
two
or
three
times
while
biddy
was
working
gone
to
pick
up
any
clue
to
the
mystery
that
might
peep
out
but
she
had
put
her
hand
on
nothing
more
it
would
have
occurred
to
her
to
say
nothing
less
than
the
so
dreadfully
pointed
presence
of
gabriel
nash
she
once
found
that
odd
satellite
to
her
surprise
paying
a
visit
to
her
sister
he
had
come
for
nick
who
was
absent
she
remembered
how
they
had
met
in
paris
and
how
little
he
had
succeeded
with
them
when
she
had
asked
biddy
afterwards
how
she
could
receive
him
that
way
biddy
had
replied
that
even
she
grace
would
have
some
charity
for
him
if
she
could
hear
how
fond
he
was
of
poor
nick
he
had
talked
to
her
only
of
nick
of
nothing
else
grace
had
observed
how
she
spoke
of
nick
as
injured
and
had
noted
the
implication
that
some
one
else
ceasing
to
be
fond
of
him
was
thereby
condemned
in
biddy
eyes
it
seemed
to
grace
that
some
one
else
had
at
least
a
right
not
to
like
some
of
his
friends
the
studio
struck
her
as
mean
and
horrid
and
so
far
from
suggesting
to
her
that
it
could
have
played
a
part
in
making
nick
and
julia
fall
out
she
only
felt
how
little
its
dusty
want
of
consequence
could
count
one
way
or
the
other
for
julia
grace
who
had
no
opinions
on
art
saw
no
merit
whatever
in
those
impressions
on
canvas
from
nick
hand
with
which
the
place
was
bestrewn
she
did
at
all
wish
her
brother
to
have
talent
in
that
direction
yet
it
was
secretly
humiliating
to
her
that
he
had
more
nick
meanwhile
felt
a
pang
of
almost
horrified
penitence
in
the
little
room
on
the
right
of
the
hall
the
moment
after
he
had
made
his
mother
really
understand
he
had
thrown
up
his
scat
and
that
it
would
probably
be
in
the
evening
papers
that
she
would
take
this
very
ill
was
an
idea
that
had
pressed
upon
him
hard
enough
but
she
took
it
even
worse
than
he
had
feared
he
measured
in
the
look
she
gave
him
when
the
full
truth
loomed
upon
her
the
mortal
cruelty
of
her
distress
her
face
was
like
that
of
a
passenger
on
a
ship
who
sees
the
huge
bows
of
another
vessel
towering
close
out
of
the
fog
there
are
visions
of
dismay
before
which
the
best
conscience
recoils
and
though
nick
had
made
his
choice
on
all
the
grounds
there
were
a
few
minutes
in
which
he
would
gladly
have
admitted
that
his
wisdom
was
a
dark
mistake
his
heart
was
in
his
throat
he
had
gone
too
far
he
had
been
ready
to
disappoint
his
mother
he
had
not
been
ready
to
destroy
her
lady
agnes
i
hasten
to
add
was
not
destroyed
she
made
after
her
first
drowning
gasp
a
tremendous
scene
of
opposition
in
the
face
of
which
her
son
could
only
fall
back
on
his
intrenchments
she
must
know
the
worst
he
had
thought
so
he
told
her
everything
including
the
little
story
of
the
forfeiture
of
his
expectations
from
carteret
he
showed
her
this
time
not
only
the
face
of
the
matter
but
what
lay
below
it
narrated
briefly
the
incident
in
his
studio
which
had
led
to
julia
dallow
deciding
she
could
after
all
put
up
with
him
this
was
wholly
new
to
lady
agnes
she
had
had
no
clue
to
it
and
he
could
instantly
see
how
it
made
the
event
worse
for
her
adding
a
hideous
positive
to
an
abominable
negative
he
noted
now
that
distressed
and
distracted
as
she
had
been
by
his
rupture
with
julia
she
had
still
held
to
the
faith
that
their
engagement
would
come
on
again
believing
evidently
that
he
had
a
personal
empire
over
the
mistress
of
harsh
which
would
bring
her
back
lady
agnes
was
forced
to
recognise
this
empire
as
precarious
to
forswear
the
hope
of
a
blessed
renewal
from
the
moment
the
question
was
of
base
infatuations
on
his
own
part
nick
confessed
to
an
infatuation
but
did
his
best
to
show
her
it
was
base
that
it
was
since
julia
had
had
faith
in
his
loyalty
for
the
person
of
the
young
lady
who
had
been
discovered
posturing
to
him
and
whom
he
had
seen
but
times
in
his
life
he
endeavoured
to
recall
to
his
mother
the
identity
of
this
young
lady
he
adverted
to
the
occasion
in
paris
when
they
all
had
seen
her
together
but
lady
agnes
mind
and
memory
were
a
blank
on
the
subject
of
miss
miriam
rooth
and
she
wanted
to
hear
nothing
whatever
about
her
it
was
enough
that
she
was
the
cause
of
their
ruin
and
a
part
of
his
pitiless
folly
she
needed
to
know
nothing
of
her
to
allude
to
her
as
if
it
were
superfluous
to
give
a
definite
name
to
the
class
to
which
she
belonged
but
she
gave
a
name
to
the
group
in
which
nick
had
now
taken
his
place
and
it
made
him
feel
after
the
lapse
of
years
like
a
small
scolded
sorry
boy
again
for
it
was
so
far
away
he
could
scarcely
remember
it
besides
there
having
been
but
a
moment
or
two
of
that
sort
in
his
happy
childhood
the
time
when
this
parent
had
slapped
him
and
called
him
a
little
fool
he
was
a
big
fool
now
hugely
immeasurable
she
repeated
the
term
over
and
over
with
passion
the
most
painful
thing
in
this
painful
hour
was
perhaps
his
glimpse
of
the
strange
feminine
cynicism
that
lurked
in
her
fine
sense
of
injury
where
there
was
such
a
complexity
of
revolt
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
pick
out
particular
wrongs
but
nick
could
see
that
to
his
imagination
he
was
most
a
fool
for
not
having
kept
his
relations
with
the
actress
whatever
they
were
better
from
julia
knowledge
he
remained
indeed
freshly
surprised
at
the
ardour
with
which
she
had
rested
her
hopes
on
julia
julia
was
certainly
a
combination
she
was
accomplished
she
was
a
sort
of
leading
woman
and
she
was
rich
but
after
all
putting
aside
what
she
might
be
to
a
man
in
love
with
her
she
was
not
the
keystone
of
the
universe
yet
the
form
in
which
the
consequences
of
his
apostasy
appeared
most
to
come
home
to
lady
agnes
was
the
loss
for
the
dormer
family
of
the
advantages
attached
to
the
possession
of
dallow
the
larger
mortification
would
round
itself
later
for
the
hour
the
damning
thing
was
that
nick
had
made
that
lady
the
gift
of
an
unforgivable
grievance
he
had
clinched
their
separation
by
his
letter
to
his
electors
and
that
above
all
was
the
wickedness
of
the
letter
julia
would
have
got
over
the
other
woman
but
she
would
never
get
over
his
becoming
a
nobody
lady
agnes
challenged
him
upon
this
low
prospect
exactly
as
if
he
had
embraced
it
with
the
malignant
purpose
of
making
the
return
of
his
late
intended
impossible
she
contradicted
her
premises
and
lost
her
way
in
her
wrath
what
had
made
him
suddenly
turn
round
if
he
had
been
in
good
faith
before
he
had
never
been
in
good
faith
never
never
he
had
had
from
his
earliest
childhood
the
nastiest
hankerings
after
a
vulgar
little
daubing
life
they
were
not
in
him
the
grander
nobler
aspirations
they
never
had
been
and
he
had
been
anything
but
honest
to
lead
her
on
to
lead
them
all
on
to
think
he
would
do
something
the
fall
and
the
shame
would
have
been
less
for
them
if
they
had
come
earlier
moreover
what
need
under
heaven
had
he
to
tell
charles
carteret
of
the
cruel
folly
on
his
very
as
if
he
might
have
let
it
all
alone
and
accepted
the
benefit
the
old
man
was
so
delighted
to
confer
no
wonder
carteret
would
keep
his
money
for
his
heirs
if
that
was
the
way
nick
proposed
to
repay
him
but
where
was
the
common
sense
where
was
the
common
charity
where
was
the
common
decency
of
tormenting
him
with
such
vile
news
in
his
last
hours
was
he
trying
what
he
could
invent
that
would
break
her
heart
that
would
send
her
in
sorrow
down
to
her
grave
were
they
all
miserable
enough
and
had
he
a
ray
of
pity
for
his
wretched
sisters
the
relation
of
effect
and
cause
in
regard
to
his
wretchedness
was
but
dimly
discernible
to
nick
who
however
perceived
his
mother
genuinely
to
consider
that
his
action
had
disconnected
them
all
still
more
than
she
held
they
were
already
disconnected
from
the
good
things
of
life
julia
was
money
carteret
was
money
everything
else
was
the
absence
of
it
if
these
precious
people
had
been
primarily
money
for
nick
it
after
all
flattered
the
distributive
impulse
in
him
to
have
taken
for
granted
that
for
the
rest
of
the
family
too
the
difference
would
have
been
so
great
for
days
for
weeks
and
months
to
come
the
little
room
on
the
right
of
the
hall
was
to
vibrate
for
our
young
man
as
if
the
very
walls
and
still
suffered
with
the
odious
trial
of
his
true
temper
xxxv
that
evening
the
evening
of
his
return
from
beauclere
he
was
conscious
of
a
keen
desire
to
get
away
to
go
abroad
to
leave
behind
him
the
little
chatter
his
resignation
would
be
sure
to
produce
in
an
age
of
publicity
which
never
discriminated
as
to
the
quality
of
events
then
he
felt
it
decidedly
better
to
stay
to
see
the
business
through
on
the
spot
besides
he
would
have
to
meet
his
constituents
would
a
parcel
of
burgesses
ever
have
been
met
on
so
queer
an
occasion
and
when
that
was
over
the
incident
would
practically
be
closed
nick
had
an
idea
he
knew
in
advance
how
it
would
affect
him
to
be
pointed
at
as
a
person
who
had
given
up
a
considerable
chance
of
eventual
office
to
take
likenesses
at
so
much
a
head
he
attempt
down
at
harsh
to
touch
on
the
question
of
motive
for
given
the
nature
of
the
public
mind
of
harsh
that
would
be
a
strain
on
his
faculty
of
exposition
but
as
regards
the
chaff
of
the
political
world
and
of
society
he
had
a
hope
he
should
find
chaff
enough
for
retorts
it
was
true
that
when
his
mother
twitted
him
in
her
own
effective
way
he
had
felt
rather
flattened
out
but
then
one
mother
might
have
a
heavier
hand
than
any
one
else
he
had
not
thrown
up
the
house
of
commons
to
amuse
himself
he
had
thrown
it
up
to
work
to
sit
quietly
down
and
bend
over
his
task
if
he
should
go
abroad
his
parent
might
think
he
had
some
view
of
joining
julia
and
trying
with
however
little
hope
to
win
her
back
an
illusion
it
would
be
singularly
pernicious
to
encourage
his
desire
for
julia
society
had
succumbed
for
the
present
at
any
rate
to
a
dire
interruption
he
had
become
more
and
more
aware
of
their
speaking
a
different
language
nick
felt
like
a
young
man
who
has
gone
to
the
rhineland
to
get
up
his
german
for
an
examination
committed
to
talk
to
read
to
dream
only
in
the
new
idiom
now
that
he
had
taken
his
jump
everything
was
simplified
at
the
same
time
that
everything
was
pitched
in
a
higher
and
intenser
key
and
he
wondered
how
in
the
absence
of
a
common
dialect
he
had
conversed
on
the
whole
so
happily
with
dallow
then
he
had
aftertastes
of
understandings
tolerably
independent
of
words
he
was
excited
because
every
fresh
responsibility
is
exciting
and
there
was
no
manner
of
doubt
he
had
accepted
one
no
one
knew
what
it
was
but
himself
gabriel
nash
scarcely
counted
his
whole
attitude
on
the
question
of
responsibility
being
so
fantastic
and
he
would
have
to
ask
his
dearest
friends
to
take
him
on
trust
rather
indeed
he
would
ask
nothing
of
any
one
but
would
cultivate
independence
mulishness
and
gaiety
and
fix
his
thoughts
on
a
bright
if
distant
morrow
it
was
disagreeable
to
have
to
remember
that
his
task
would
not
be
sweetened
by
a
sense
of
heroism
for
if
it
might
be
heroic
to
give
up
the
muses
for
the
strife
of
great
affairs
no
romantic
glamour
worth
speaking
of
would
ever
gather
round
an
englishman
who
in
the
prime
of
his
strength
had
given
up
great
or
even
small
affairs
for
the
muses
such
an
original
might
himself
privately
and
perversely
regard
certain
phases
of
this
inferior
commerce
as
a
great
affair
but
who
would
give
him
the
benefit
of
that
sort
of
confidence
except
indeed
a
faithful
clever
exalted
little
sister
biddy
if
he
should
have
the
good
luck
to
have
one
biddy
was
in
fact
all
ready
for
heroic
flights
and
eager
to
think
she
might
fight
the
battle
of
the
beautiful
by
her
brother
side
so
that
he
had
really
to
moderate
her
and
remind
her
how
little
his
actual
job
was
a
crusade
with
bugles
and
banners
and
how
much
a
grey
sedentary
grind
the
charm
of
which
was
all
at
the
core
you
might
have
an
emotion
about
it
and
an
emotion
that
would
be
a
help
but
this
was
not
the
sort
of
thing
you
could
show
the
end
in
view
would
seem
so
disproportionately
small
nick
put
it
to
her
that
one
really
could
talk
to
people
about
the
responsibility
of
what
she
would
see
him
pottering
at
in
his
studio
he
therefore
did
run
as
he
would
have
said
to
winged
words
any
more
than
he
was
forced
to
having
moreover
a
sense
that
apologetic
work
if
apology
it
should
be
called
to
carry
the
war
straight
into
the
enemy
country
might
be
freely
left
to
gabriel
nash
he
laid
the
weight
of
explanation
on
his
commentators
meeting
them
all
on
the
firm
ground
of
his
own
amusement
he
saw
he
should
live
for
months
in
a
thick
cloud
of
irony
not
the
finest
air
of
the
season
and
he
adopted
the
weapon
to
which
a
person
whose
use
of
tobacco
is
only
occasional
resorts
when
every
one
else
produces
a
cigar
he
puffed
the
spasmodic
defensive
cigarette
he
accepted
as
to
what
he
had
done
the
postulate
of
the
obscurely
tortuous
abounding
so
in
that
sense
that
his
critics
were
themselves
bewildered
some
of
them
felt
that
they
got
as
the
phrase
is
little
out
of
him
he
rose
in
his
good
humour
so
much
higher
than
the
rise
they
had
looked
for
on
his
very
first
encounter
with
the
world
after
his
scrimmage
with
his
mother
he
went
to
a
he
had
accepted
the
invitation
many
days
before
having
seen
his
resignation
in
the
form
of
a
telegram
from
harsh
announced
in
the
evening
papers
the
people
he
found
there
had
seen
it
as
well
and
the
wittiest
wanted
to
know
what
he
was
now
going
to
do
even
the
most
embarrassed
asked
if
it
were
true
he
had
changed
his
politics
he
gave
different
answers
to
different
persons
but
left
most
of
them
under
the
impression
that
he
had
strange
scruples
of
conscience
this
however
was
not
a
formidable
occasion
for
there
had
happened
to
be
no
one
present
he
would
have
desired
on
the
old
basis
especially
to
gratify
there
were
real
good
friends
it
would
be
less
easy
to
meet
nick
was
almost
sorry
for
an
hour
that
he
had
so
many
real
good
friends
if
he
had
had
more
enemies
the
case
would
have
been
simpler
and
he
was
fully
aware
that
the
hardest
thing
of
all
would
be
to
be
let
off
too
easily
then
he
would
appear
to
himself
to
have
been
put
all
round
on
his
generosity
and
his
deviation
would
thus
wear
its
ugliest
face
when
he
left
the
place
at
which
he
had
been
dining
he
betook
himself
to
rosedale
road
he
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
go
down
to
the
house
though
he
knew
he
had
not
done
with
that
yet
he
had
a
dread
of
behaving
as
if
he
supposed
he
should
be
expected
to
make
a
farewell
speech
and
was
thankful
his
eminence
was
not
of
a
nature
to
create
on
such
an
occasion
a
demand
for
his
oratory
he
had
in
fact
nothing
whatever
to
say
in
public
not
a
vain
word
not
a
sorry
syllable
though
the
hour
was
late
he
found
gabriel
nash
established
in
his
studio
drawn
thither
by
the
fine
exhilaration
of
having
seen
an
evening
paper
trying
it
late
on
the
chance
he
had
been
told
by
nick
servant
that
nick
would
sleep
there
that
night
and
he
had
come
in
to
wait
he
was
so
eager
to
congratulate
him
nick
submitted
with
a
good
grace
to
his
society
he
was
tired
enough
to
go
to
bed
but
was
restless
too
in
spite
of
noting
now
oddly
enough
that
nash
congratulations
could
add
little
to
his
fortitude
he
had
felt
a
good
deal
before
as
if
he
were
in
this
philosopher
hands
but
since
making
his
final
choice
he
had
begun
to
strike
himself
as
all
in
his
own
gabriel
might
have
been
the
angel
of
that
name
but
no
angel
could
assist
him
much
henceforth
nash
indeed
was
as
true
as
ever
to
his
genius
while
he
lolled
on
a
divan
and
emitted
a
series
of
reflexions
that
were
even
more
ingenious
than
opportune
nick
walked
up
and
down
the
room
and
it
might
have
been
supposed
from
his
manner
that
he
was
impatient
for
his
friend
to
withdraw
this
idea
would
have
been
contradicted
however
by
the
fact
that
subsequently
after
the
latter
had
quitted
him
he
continued
to
perambulate
he
had
grown
used
to
gabriel
and
must
now
have
been
possessed
of
all
he
had
to
say
that
was
one
penalty
with
persons
whose
main
gift
was
for
talk
however
inspiring
talk
engendered
a
sense
of
sameness
much
sooner
than
action
the
things
a
man
did
were
necessarily
more
different
from
each
other
than
the
things
he
said
even
if
he
went
in
for
surprising
you
nick
felt
nash
could
never
surprise
him
any
more
save
by
mere
plain
perpetration
he
talked
of
his
host
future
talked
of
miriam
rooth
and
of
peter
sherringham
whom
he
had
seen
at
that
young
woman
and
whom
he
described
as
in
a
predicament
delightful
to
behold
nick
put
a
question
about
peter
predicament
and
learned
rather
to
his
disappointment
that
it
consisted
only
of
the
fact
that
he
was
in
love
with
miriam
he
appealed
to
his
visitor
to
do
better
than
this
and
nash
then
added
the
touch
that
sherringham
would
be
able
to
have
her
oh
they
ideas
he
said
when
nick
asked
him
why
what
ideas
so
has
he
i
suppose
yes
but
they
not
the
same
well
they
nevertheless
arrange
something
nick
opined
you
have
to
help
them
a
bit
she
in
love
with
another
man
nash
went
on
do
you
mean
with
you
oh
i
never
another
man
i
always
more
the
wrong
one
than
the
man
himself
it
you
she
after
and
on
his
friend
asking
him
what
he
meant
by
this
nash
added
while
you
were
engaged
in
transferring
her
image
to
the
tablet
of
your
genius
you
stamped
your
own
on
that
of
her
heart
nick
stopped
in
his
walk
staring
ah
what
a
bore
a
bore
do
you
think
her
formed
to
please
nick
wondered
but
did
conclude
i
wanted
to
go
on
with
her
now
i
ca
nash
himself
however
jumped
straight
to
what
really
mattered
my
dear
fellow
it
only
makes
her
handsomer
i
wondered
what
happy
turn
she
had
taken
oh
that
twaddle
said
nick
turning
away
besides
has
she
told
you
no
but
her
mother
has
has
she
told
her
mother
rooth
says
not
but
i
known
rooth
to
say
that
which
is
apply
that
rule
then
to
the
information
you
speak
of
well
since
you
press
me
i
know
more
gabriel
said
miriam
knows
you
engaged
to
a
wonderful
rich
lady
she
told
me
as
much
told
me
she
had
seen
her
here
that
was
enough
to
set
her
off
she
likes
forbidden
fruit
i
not
engaged
to
any
lady
whatever
i
was
nick
handsomely
conceded
but
we
altered
our
minds
ah
what
a
pity
his
friend
wailed
mephistopheles
and
he
stopped
again
with
the
point
of
this
pray
then
whom
do
you
call
margaret
may
i
ask
if
your
failure
of
interest
in
the
political
situation
is
the
cause
of
this
change
in
your
personal
one
nash
went
on
nick
signified
that
he
might
whereupon
he
added
i
not
in
the
least
devilish
i
only
mean
it
a
pity
altered
your
minds
since
miriam
may
in
consequence
alter
hers
she
goes
from
one
thing
to
another
however
i
wo
tell
her
i
will
then
nick
declared
between
jest
and
earnest
would
that
really
be
prudent
his
companion
asked
more
completely
in
the
frolic
key
at
any
rate
he
resumed
nothing
would
induce
me
to
interfere
with
peter
sherringham
that
sounds
fatuous
but
to
you
i
do
mind
appearing
an
ass
the
thing
would
be
to
get
sherringham
out
of
spite
nash
threw
off
to
entangle
himself
with
another
woman
what
good
would
that
do
ah
miriam
would
then
begin
to
think
of
him
spite
surely
is
a
conceivable
motive
for
a
healthy
man
the
plea
however
found
gabriel
ready
sherringham
just
precisely
not
a
healthy
man
he
too
much
in
love
then
he
wo
care
for
another
woman
he
would
try
to
and
that
would
produce
its
effect
its
effect
on
miriam
you
talk
like
an
american
novel
let
him
try
and
god
keep
us
all
straight
nick
adverted
in
extreme
silence
to
his
poor
little
biddy
and
greatly
hoped
he
would
have
to
see
to
it
a
little
that
peter
would
try
on
he
changed
the
subject
and
before
nash
withdrew
took
occasion
to
remark
the
occasion
was
offered
by
some
new
allusion
of
the
visitor
to
the
sport
he
hoped
to
extract
from
seeing
nick
carry
out
everything
to
which
he
stood
committed
that
the
comedy
of
the
matter
would
fall
flat
and
the
incident
pass
unnoticed
but
nash
lost
no
heart
oh
if
you
simply
do
your
part
i
take
care
of
the
rest
if
you
mean
by
doing
my
part
minding
my
business
and
working
like
a
beaver
i
shall
easily
satisfy
you
nick
replied
ah
you
reprobate
you
become
another
sir
joshua
a
mere
his
companion
railed
getting
up
to
go
when
he
had
gone
nick
threw
himself
back
on
the
cushions
of
the
divan
and
with
his
hands
locked
above
his
head
sat
a
long
time
lost
in
thought
he
had
sent
his
servant
to
bed
he
was
unmolested
he
gazed
before
him
into
the
gloom
produced
by
the
unheeded
of
the
last
candle
the
vague
outer
light
came
in
through
the
tall
studio
window
and
the
painted
images
ranged
about
looked
confused
in
the
dusk
if
his
mother
had
seen
him
she
might
have
thought
he
was
staring
at
his
father
ghost
xxxvi
the
night
peter
sherringham
walked
away
from
balaklava
place
with
gabriel
nash
the
talk
of
the
two
men
directed
itself
as
was
natural
at
the
time
to
the
question
of
miriam
future
fame
and
the
pace
as
nash
called
it
at
which
she
would
go
critical
spirits
as
they
both
were
and
one
of
them
as
dissimulative
in
passion
as
the
other
was
paradoxical
in
the
absence
of
it
they
yet
took
her
career
for
granted
as
completely
as
the
a
pair
of
hot
spectators
in
the
pit
might
have
done
and
exchanged
observations
on
the
assumption
that
the
only
uncertain
element
would
be
the
pace
this
was
a
proof
of
general
subjugation
peter
wished
not
to
show
yet
wished
to
know
and
in
the
restlessness
of
his
anxiety
was
ready
even
to
risk
exposure
great
as
the
sacrifice
might
be
of
the
imperturbable
urbane
scepticism
most
appropriate
to
a
secretary
of
embassy
he
could
rid
himself
of
the
sense
that
nash
had
got
up
earlier
than
he
had
had
opportunities
of
contact
in
days
already
distant
the
days
of
rooth
hungry
foreign
rambles
something
of
authority
and
privilege
stuck
to
him
from
this
and
it
made
sherringham
still
more
uncomfortable
when
he
was
most
conscious
that
at
the
best
even
the
trained
diplomatic
mind
would
never
get
a
grasp
of
miriam
as
a
whole
she
was
constructed
to
revolve
like
the
terraqueous
globe
some
part
or
other
of
her
was
always
out
of
sight
or
in
shadow
peter
talked
to
conceal
his
feelings
and
like
many
a
man
practising
that
indirectness
rather
lost
himself
in
the
wood
they
agreed
that
putting
strange
accidents
aside
the
girl
would
go
further
than
any
one
had
gone
in
england
within
the
memory
of
man
and
that
it
was
a
pity
as
regards
marking
the
comparison
that
for
so
long
no
one
had
gone
any
distance
worth
speaking
of
they
further
agreed
that
it
would
naturally
seem
absurd
to
any
one
who
did
know
their
prophesying
such
big
things
on
such
small
evidence
and
they
agreed
lastly
that
the
absurdity
quite
vanished
as
soon
as
the
prophets
knew
as
knew
their
knowledge
they
quite
recognised
this
was
simply
confidence
raised
to
a
high
point
the
communication
of
their
young
friend
own
confidence
the
conditions
were
enormously
to
make
but
it
was
of
the
very
essence
of
miriam
confidence
that
she
would
make
them
the
parts
the
plays
the
theatres
the
support
the
audiences
the
critics
the
money
were
all
to
be
found
but
she
cast
a
spell
that
prevented
this
from
seeming
a
serious
hitch
one
might
see
from
one
day
to
the
other
what
she
would
do
or
how
she
would
do
it
but
this
would
stay
her
steps
she
would
none
the
less
go
on
she
would
have
to
construct
her
own
road
as
it
were
but
at
the
worst
there
would
only
be
delays
in
making
it
these
delays
would
depend
on
the
hardness
of
the
stones
she
had
to
break
as
peter
had
noted
you
never
knew
where
to
have
gabriel
nash
a
truth
exemplified
in
his
unexpected
delight
at
the
prospect
of
drawing
forth
the
modernness
of
the
age
you
might
have
thought
he
would
loathe
that
modernness
but
he
had
a
joyous
amused
amusing
vision
of
it
saw
it
as
something
huge
and
fantastically
vulgar
its
vulgarity
would
rise
to
the
grand
style
like
that
of
a
london
railway
station
and
the
publicity
achieved
by
their
charming
charge
be
as
big
as
the
globe
itself
all
the
machinery
was
ready
the
platform
laid
the
facilities
the
wires
and
bells
and
trumpets
the
roaring
deafening
newspaperism
of
the
period
its
most
distinctive
sign
were
waiting
for
her
their
predestined
mistress
to
press
her
foot
on
the
spring
and
set
them
all
in
motion
gabriel
brushed
in
a
large
bright
picture
of
her
progress
through
the
time
and
round
the
world
round
it
and
round
it
again
from
continent
to
continent
and
clime
to
clime
with
populations
and
deputations
reporters
and
photographers
placards
and
interviews
and
banquets
steamers
railways
dollars
diamonds
speeches
and
artistic
ruin
all
jumbled
into
her
train
regardless
of
expense
the
spectacle
would
be
and
thrilling
though
somewhat
monotonous
the
drama
a
drama
more
bustling
than
any
she
would
put
on
the
stage
and
a
spectacle
that
would
beat
everything
for
scenery
in
the
end
her
divine
voice
would
crack
screaming
to
foreign
ears
and
antipodal
barbarians
and
her
clever
manner
would
lose
all
quality
simplified
to
a
few
unmistakable
dodges
then
she
would
be
at
the
fine
climax
of
life
and
glory
still
young
and
insatiate
but
already
coarse
hard
and
raddled
with
nothing
left
to
do
and
nothing
left
to
do
it
with
the
remaining
years
all
before
her
and
the
all
behind
it
would
be
splendid
dreadful
grotesque
oh
she
have
some
good
years
they
be
worth
having
peter
insisted
as
they
went
besides
you
see
her
too
much
as
a
humbug
and
too
little
as
a
real
producer
she
has
ideas
great
ones
she
loves
the
thing
for
itself
that
may
keep
a
woman
serious
her
greatest
idea
must
always
be
to
show
herself
and
fortunately
she
has
a
great
quantity
of
that
treasure
to
show
i
think
of
her
absolutely
as
a
real
producer
but
as
a
producer
whose
production
is
her
own
person
no
even
as
fine
a
one
as
hers
will
stand
that
for
more
than
an
hour
so
that
humbuggery
has
very
soon
to
lend
a
hand
however
nash
continued
if
she
a
fine
humbug
it
will
do
as
well
it
will
perfectly
suit
the
time
we
can
all
be
saved
by
vulgarity
the
solvent
of
all
difficulties
and
the
blessing
of
this
delightful
age
one
does
die
of
it
save
in
soul
and
sense
one
dies
only
of
minding
it
therefore
let
no
man
despair
a
new
hope
has
dawned
she
do
her
work
like
any
other
worker
with
the
advantage
over
many
that
her
talent
rare
peter
obliquely
answered
compared
with
the
life
of
many
women
that
security
and
sanity
of
the
highest
order
then
she
ca
help
her
beauty
you
ca
vulgarise
that
oh
ca
you
gabriel
cried
it
will
abide
with
her
till
the
day
of
her
death
it
is
a
mere
superficial
freshness
she
very
noble
yes
that
the
pity
of
it
said
nash
she
a
big
more
or
less
directed
force
and
i
quite
admit
that
she
do
for
a
while
a
lot
of
good
she
have
brightened
up
the
world
for
a
great
many
people
have
brought
the
ideal
nearer
to
them
and
held
it
fast
for
an
hour
with
its
feet
on
earth
and
its
great
wings
trembling
that
always
something
for
blest
is
he
who
has
dropped
even
the
smallest
coin
into
the
little
iron
box
that
contains
the
precious
savings
of
mankind
miriam
will
doubtless
have
dropped
a
big
it
will
be
found
in
the
general
scramble
on
the
day
the
race
goes
bankrupt
and
then
for
herself
have
had
a
great
go
at
life
oh
yes
she
have
got
out
of
her
hole
she
wo
have
vegetated
peter
concurred
that
makes
her
touching
to
me
it
adds
to
the
many
good
reasons
for
which
one
may
want
to
help
her
she
tackling
a
big
job
and
tackling
it
by
herself
throwing
herself
upon
the
world
in
good
faith
and
dealing
with
it
as
she
can
meeting
alone
in
her
youth
her
beauty
her
generosity
all
the
embarrassments
of
notoriety
and
all
the
difficulties
of
a
profession
of
which
if
one
half
what
called
brilliant
the
other
frankly
odious
she
has
great
courage
but
you
speak
of
her
as
solitary
with
such
a
lot
of
us
all
round
her
nash
candidly
inquired
she
a
great
thing
for
you
and
me
but
we
a
small
thing
for
her
well
a
good
many
small
things
if
they
but
stick
together
may
make
up
a
mass
gabriel
said
there
must
always
be
the
man
you
see
he
the
indispensable
element
in
such
a
life
and
he
be
the
last
thing
ever
lack
what
man
are
you
talking
about
peter
asked
with
imperfect
ease
the
man
of
the
hour
whoever
he
is
she
inspire
innumerable
devotions
of
course
she
will
and
they
be
precisely
a
part
of
the
insufferable
side
of
her
life
insufferable
to
whom
nash
demanded
do
forget
that
the
insufferable
side
of
her
life
will
be
just
the
side
she
thrive
on
you
ca
eat
your
cake
and
have
it
and
you
ca
make
omelettes
without
breaking
eggs
you
ca
at
once
sit
by
the
fire
and
parade
about
the
world
and
you
ca
take
all
chances
without
having
some
adventures
you
ca
be
a
great
actress
without
the
luxury
of
nerves
without
a
plentiful
supply
or
without
the
right
ones
you
only
be
second
fiddle
if
you
all
the
tense
strings
you
may
take
life
for
your
fiddlestick
your
nerves
and
your
adventures
your
eggs
and
your
cake
are
part
of
the
cost
of
the
most
expensive
of
professions
you
play
with
human
passions
with
exaltations
and
ecstasies
and
terrors
and
if
you
trade
on
the
fury
of
the
elements
you
must
know
how
to
ride
the
storm
well
peter
thought
it
over
those
are
the
fine
old
commonplaces
about
the
artistic
temperament
but
i
usually
find
the
artist
a
very
meek
decent
little
person
you
find
the
artist
you
only
find
his
work
and
that
all
you
need
find
when
the
artist
a
woman
and
the
woman
an
actress
meekness
and
decency
will
doubtless
be
there
in
the
right
proportions
nash
went
on
miriam
will
represent
them
for
you
if
you
give
her
her
cue
with
the
utmost
charm
of
course
she
inspire
devotions
all
right
said
peter
with
a
wild
cheerfulness
and
of
course
they
inspire
responses
and
with
that
consequence
do
you
see
they
mitigate
her
solitude
they
even
enliven
it
nash
set
forth
she
probably
box
a
good
many
ears
that
be
lively
peter
returned
with
some
grimness
oh
magnificent
it
will
be
a
merry
life
yet
with
its
tragic
passages
its
distracted
or
its
pathetic
hours
gabriel
insisted
in
short
a
little
of
everything
they
walked
on
without
further
speech
till
at
last
peter
resumed
the
best
thing
for
a
woman
in
her
situation
is
to
marry
some
decent
man
oh
i
daresay
she
do
that
too
nash
laughed
a
remark
as
a
result
of
which
his
companion
lapsed
afresh
into
silence
gabriel
left
him
a
little
to
enjoy
this
after
which
he
added
there
somebody
marry
peter
wondered
do
you
mean
her
friend
dashwood
no
no
i
mean
nick
dormer
she
marry
peter
gasped
i
mean
her
head
full
of
him
but
she
hardly
get
the
chance
peter
watched
himself
does
she
like
him
as
much
as
that
i
do
quite
know
how
much
you
mean
but
enough
for
all
practical
ends
marrying
a
fashionable
actress
is
hardly
a
practical
end
certainly
not
but
i
not
speaking
from
his
point
of
view
nash
was
perfectly
lucid
moreover
i
thought
you
just
now
said
it
would
be
such
a
good
thing
for
her
to
marry
nick
dormer
you
said
a
good
decent
man
and
he
one
of
the
very
decentest
i
was
thinking
of
the
individual
but
of
the
protection
it
would
fence
her
about
settle
certain
questions
or
appear
to
it
would
make
things
safe
and
comfortable
for
her
and
keep
a
lot
of
cads
and
blackguards
away
she
ought
to
marry
the
prompter
or
the
said
nash
then
it
would
be
all
right
i
think
indeed
they
generally
do
do
they
peter
felt
for
a
moment
a
strong
disposition
to
drop
his
friend
on
the
spot
to
cross
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
walk
away
without
him
but
there
was
a
different
impulse
which
struggled
with
this
one
and
after
a
minute
overcame
it
the
impulse
that
led
to
his
saying
presently
has
she
told
you
she
a
she
in
love
with
nick
no
no
that
not
the
way
i
know
it
has
nick
told
you
then
on
the
contrary
i
told
you
rendered
him
a
questionable
service
if
you
no
proof
peter
pronounced
my
proof
only
that
i
seen
her
with
him
she
charming
poor
dear
thing
but
surely
she
is
in
love
with
every
man
she
charming
to
i
mean
she
charming
to
nash
returned
i
see
her
that
way
i
see
her
interested
and
what
it
does
to
her
with
her
her
but
judge
for
yourself
the
first
time
you
get
a
chance
when
shall
i
get
a
chance
nick
does
come
near
her
oh
he
come
he
come
his
picture
is
finished
you
mean
be
the
then
my
dear
fellow
i
shall
never
allow
it
said
gabriel
nash
it
would
be
idiotic
and
quite
unnecessary
he
beautifully
arranged
in
quite
a
different
line
fancy
his
taking
that
sort
of
job
on
his
hands
besides
she
never
expect
it
she
not
such
a
goose
they
very
good
friends
it
will
go
on
that
way
she
an
excellent
person
for
him
to
know
she
give
him
lots
of
ideas
of
the
plastic
kind
he
would
have
been
up
there
before
this
but
it
has
taken
him
time
to
play
his
delightful
trick
on
his
constituents
that
of
course
is
pure
amusement
but
when
once
his
effect
has
been
well
produced
he
get
back
to
business
and
his
business
will
be
a
very
different
matter
from
miriam
imagine
him
writing
her
advertisements
living
on
her
money
adding
up
her
profits
having
rows
and
recriminations
with
her
agent
carrying
her
shawl
spending
his
days
in
her
the
right
man
for
that
if
she
must
have
one
will
turn
up
le
mariage
she
is
wholly
an
idiot
she
really
for
a
woman
quite
sees
things
as
they
are
as
peter
had
not
crossed
the
street
and
left
gabriel
planted
he
now
suffered
the
extremity
of
irritation
but
descrying
in
the
dim
vista
of
the
edgware
road
a
vague
and
vigilant
hansom
he
waved
his
stick
with
eagerness
and
with
the
abrupt
declaration
that
feeling
tired
he
must
drive
the
rest
of
his
way
he
offered
nash
as
he
entered
the
vehicle
no
seat
but
this
coldness
was
not
reflected
in
the
lucidity
with
which
that
master
of
every
subject
went
on
to
affirm
that
there
was
of
course
a
danger
the
danger
that
in
given
circumstances
miriam
would
leave
the
stage
leave
it
you
mean
for
some
man
for
the
man
we
talking
about
for
nick
dormer
peter
asked
from
his
place
in
the
cab
his
paleness
lighted
by
its
lamps
if
he
should
make
it
a
condition
but
why
should
he
why
should
he
make
conditions
he
not
an
ass
either
you
see
it
would
be
a
bore
nash
kept
it
up
while
the
hansom
waited
because
if
she
were
to
do
anything
of
that
sort
she
make
him
pay
for
the
sacrifice
oh
yes
she
make
him
pay
for
the
sacrifice
peter
blindly
concurred
and
then
when
he
had
paid
she
go
back
to
her
footlights
gabriel
developed
from
the
curbstone
as
his
companion
closed
the
apron
of
the
cab
i
see
she
go
back
peter
returned
go
on
he
cried
to
the
driver
through
the
hole
in
the
roof
and
while
the
vehicle
rolled
away
he
growled
to
himself
of
course
she
would
and
quite
right
xxxvii
judge
for
yourself
when
you
get
a
chance
nash
had
said
to
him
and
as
it
turned
out
he
was
able
to
judge
two
days
later
for
he
found
his
cousin
in
balaklava
place
on
the
tuesday
following
his
walk
with
their
insufferable
friend
he
had
not
only
stayed
away
from
the
theatre
on
the
monday
evening
he
regarded
this
as
an
achievement
of
some
importance
but
had
not
been
near
miriam
during
the
day
he
had
meant
to
absent
himself
from
her
company
on
tuesday
as
well
a
determination
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
the
afternoon
turned
to
rain
but
when
at
ten
minutes
to
five
he
jumped
into
a
hansom
and
directed
his
course
to
saint
john
wood
it
was
precisely
upon
the
weather
that
he
shifted
the
responsibility
of
his
behaviour
miriam
had
dined
when
he
reached
the
villa
but
she
was
lying
down
unduly
fatigued
before
going
to
the
theatre
rooth
was
however
in
the
with
three
gentlemen
in
two
of
whom
the
fourth
visitor
was
not
startled
to
recognise
basil
dashwood
and
gabriel
nash
dashwood
appeared
to
have
become
miriam
and
a
second
child
a
fonder
one
to
rooth
it
had
reached
peter
on
some
late
visit
that
the
young
actor
had
finally
moved
his
lodgings
into
the
quarter
making
himself
a
near
neighbour
for
all
sorts
of
convenience
hang
his
convenience
peter
thought
perceiving
that
arty
was
now
altogether
one
of
the
family
oh
the
family
it
was
a
queer
one
to
be
connected
with
that
consciousness
was
acute
in
sherringham
breast
as
he
entered
rooth
little
circle
the
place
was
filled
with
and
there
was
a
messy
on
the
piano
whose
keys
basil
dashwood
lightly
touched
for
his
own
diversion
nash
addressing
the
room
of
course
was
at
one
end
of
a
little
sofa
with
his
nose
in
the
air
and
nick
dormer
was
at
the
other
end
seated
much
at
his
ease
and
with
a
certain
privileged
appearance
of
having
been
there
often
before
though
sherringham
knew
he
had
not
he
looked
uncritical
and
very
young
as
rosy
as
a
on
a
it
was
past
five
in
the
day
but
rooth
was
not
dressed
there
was
however
no
want
of
finish
in
her
elegant
attitude
the
same
relaxed
grandeur
she
seemed
to
let
you
understand
for
which
she
used
to
be
distinguished
at
castle
nugent
when
the
house
was
full
she
toyed
incongruously
in
her
unbuttoned
wrapper
with
a
large
tinsel
fan
which
resembled
a
theatrical
property
it
was
one
of
the
discomforts
of
peter
position
that
many
of
those
minor
matters
which
are
superficially
at
least
most
characteristic
of
the
histrionic
life
had
power
to
displease
him
so
that
he
was
obliged
constantly
to
overlook
and
condone
and
pretend
he
disliked
besmoked
and
irregular
meals
and
untidy
arrangements
he
could
suffer
from
the
vulgarity
of
rooth
apartments
the
importunate
photographs
which
gave
on
his
nerves
the
barbarous
absence
of
signs
of
an
orderly
domestic
life
the
odd
volumes
from
the
circulating
library
you
could
see
what
they
were
the
very
covers
told
you
at
a
glance
tumbled
about
under
smeary
cups
and
glasses
he
had
waited
till
now
to
feel
it
rum
that
fate
should
have
let
him
in
for
such
contacts
but
as
he
stood
before
his
hostess
and
her
companions
he
wondered
perhaps
more
than
ever
why
he
should
her
companions
somehow
who
were
not
responsible
did
keep
down
his
wonder
which
was
particularly
odd
since
they
were
not
superficially
in
the
least
of
bohemian
type
almost
the
first
thing
that
struck
him
as
happened
in
coming
into
the
room
was
the
fresh
fact
of
the
high
good
looks
of
his
cousin
a
gentleman
to
one
taste
and
for
one
faith
in
a
different
enough
degree
from
the
conversible
dashwood
peter
did
hate
nick
for
being
of
so
fine
an
english
grain
he
knew
rather
the
brush
of
a
new
wave
of
annoyance
at
julia
stupid
failure
to
get
on
with
him
under
that
good
omen
it
was
his
first
encounter
with
the
late
member
for
harsh
since
his
arrival
in
london
they
had
been
on
one
side
and
the
other
so
much
taken
up
with
their
affairs
since
their
last
meeting
nick
had
as
we
know
to
his
kinsman
perception
really
put
on
a
new
character
he
had
done
the
finest
stroke
of
business
in
the
quietest
way
this
had
made
him
a
presence
to
be
counted
with
and
in
just
the
sense
in
which
poor
peter
desired
least
to
count
poor
peter
after
his
somersault
in
the
blue
had
just
lately
been
much
troubled
he
was
ravaged
by
contending
passions
he
paid
every
hour
in
a
torment
of
unrest
for
what
was
false
in
his
position
the
impossibility
of
keeping
the
presentable
parts
of
his
character
together
the
opposition
of
interest
and
desire
nick
his
junior
and
a
lighter
weight
had
settled
problem
and
showed
no
wounds
there
was
something
impertinent
and
mystifying
in
it
yet
he
looked
into
the
bargain
too
innocently
young
and
happy
and
too
careless
and
modest
and
amateurish
to
figure
as
a
rival
or
even
as
the
genius
he
was
apparently
going
to
try
to
be
the
genius
that
the
other
day
in
the
studio
there
with
biddy
peter
had
got
a
startled
glimpse
of
his
power
to
become
julia
brother
would
have
liked
to
be
aware
of
grounds
of
resentment
to
be
able
to
hold
she
had
been
badly
treated
or
that
nick
was
basely
fatuous
for
in
that
case
he
might
have
had
the
resource
of
taking
offence
but
where
was
the
outrage
of
his
merely
being
liked
by
a
woman
in
respect
to
whom
one
had
definitely
denied
one
self
the
luxury
of
pretensions
especially
if
as
the
he
had
taken
no
action
in
the
matter
it
could
scarcely
be
called
to
call
casually
on
an
afternoon
when
the
lady
did
seem
to
be
there
peter
could
at
any
rate
rejoice
that
miriam
did
and
he
proposed
to
himself
suggesting
to
nick
after
a
little
that
they
should
adjourn
together
they
had
such
interesting
things
to
talk
about
meanwhile
nick
greeted
him
with
a
friendly
freedom
in
which
he
could
read
neither
confusion
nor
defiance
peter
was
reassured
against
a
danger
he
believed
he
did
recognise
and
puzzled
by
a
mystery
he
flattered
himself
he
had
heeded
and
he
was
still
more
ashamed
of
being
reassured
than
of
being
puzzled
it
must
be
recorded
that
miriam
absence
from
the
scene
was
not
prolonged
nick
as
sherringham
gathered
had
been
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
the
house
which
would
have
given
her
gratified
by
his
presence
due
time
to
array
herself
to
come
down
to
him
at
all
events
she
was
in
the
room
prepared
apparently
to
go
to
the
theatre
very
shortly
after
one
of
her
guests
had
become
sensible
of
how
glad
he
was
she
was
out
of
it
familiarity
had
never
yet
cured
him
of
a
certain
tremor
of
expectation
and
even
of
suspense
in
regard
to
her
entrances
a
flutter
caused
by
the
simple
circumstance
of
her
infinite
variety
to
say
she
was
always
acting
would
too
much
convey
that
she
was
often
fatiguing
since
her
changing
face
affected
this
particular
admirer
at
least
not
as
a
series
of
masks
but
as
a
response
to
perceived
differences
an
intensity
of
that
perception
or
still
more
as
something
richly
constructional
like
the
shifting
of
the
scene
in
a
play
or
like
a
room
with
many
windows
the
image
she
was
to
project
was
always
incalculable
but
if
her
present
denied
her
past
and
declined
responsibility
for
her
future
it
made
a
good
thing
of
the
hour
and
kept
the
actual
peculiarly
fresh
this
time
the
actual
was
a
bright
gentle
graceful
smiling
young
woman
in
a
new
dress
eager
to
go
out
drawing
on
fresh
gloves
who
looked
as
if
she
were
about
to
step
into
a
carriage
and
it
was
gabriel
nash
who
thus
formulated
her
physiognomy
do
a
lot
of
london
things
the
young
woman
had
time
to
spare
however
and
she
sat
down
and
talked
and
laughed
and
presently
gave
as
seemed
to
peter
a
deeper
glow
to
the
tawdry
little
room
which
could
do
for
others
if
it
had
to
do
for
her
she
described
herself
as
in
a
state
of
nervous
muddle
exhausted
blinded
with
the
rehearsals
of
the
forthcoming
piece
the
first
night
was
close
at
hand
and
it
was
going
to
be
of
a
vileness
they
would
all
see
but
there
was
no
correspondence
between
this
account
of
the
matter
and
her
present
bravery
of
mood
she
sent
her
mother
away
to
put
on
some
clothes
or
something
and
left
alone
with
the
visitors
went
to
a
long
glass
between
the
windows
talking
always
to
nick
dormer
and
revised
and
rearranged
a
little
her
own
attire
she
talked
to
nick
over
her
shoulder
and
to
nick
only
as
if
he
were
the
guest
to
recognise
and
the
others
did
count
she
broke
out
at
once
on
his
having
thrown
up
his
seat
wished
to
know
if
the
strange
story
told
her
by
nash
were
true
that
he
had
knocked
all
the
hopes
of
his
party
into
pie
nick
took
it
any
way
she
liked
and
gave
a
pleasant
picture
of
his
party
ruin
the
critical
condition
of
public
affairs
he
was
as
yet
clearly
closed
to
contrition
or
shame
the
pilgrim
from
paris
before
miriam
entrance
had
not
in
shaking
hands
with
him
made
even
a
roundabout
allusion
to
his
odd
game
he
felt
he
must
somehow
show
good
taste
so
english
people
often
feel
at
the
cost
of
good
manners
but
he
winced
on
seeing
how
his
scruples
had
been
wasted
and
was
struck
with
the
fine
jocose
direct
turn
of
his
kinsman
conversation
with
the
young
actress
it
was
a
part
of
her
unexpectedness
that
she
took
the
heavy
literal
view
of
nick
behaviour
declared
frankly
though
without
ill
nature
that
she
had
no
patience
with
his
mistake
she
was
horribly
disappointed
she
had
set
her
heart
on
his
being
a
great
statesman
one
of
the
rulers
of
the
people
and
the
glories
of
england
what
was
so
useful
what
was
so
noble
how
it
belittled
everything
else
she
had
expected
him
to
wear
a
cordon
and
a
star
some
day
acquiring
them
with
the
greatest
promptitude
and
then
to
come
and
see
her
in
her
it
would
look
so
particularly
well
she
talked
after
the
manner
of
a
lovely
philistine
except
perhaps
when
she
expressed
surprise
at
hearing
hearing
from
gabriel
nash
that
in
england
gentlemen
accoutred
with
those
emblems
of
their
sovereign
esteem
did
so
far
forget
themselves
as
to
stray
into
the
of
actresses
she
admitted
after
a
moment
that
they
were
quite
right
and
the
of
actresses
nasty
places
but
she
was
sorry
for
that
was
the
sort
of
thing
she
had
always
figured
in
a
corner
a
distinguished
man
slightly
bald
in
evening
dress
with
orders
admiring
the
smallness
of
a
satin
shoe
and
saying
witty
things
nash
was
convulsed
with
hilarity
at
this
such
a
vision
of
the
british
political
hero
coming
back
from
the
glass
and
making
that
critic
give
her
his
place
on
the
sofa
she
seated
herself
near
nick
and
continued
to
express
her
regret
at
his
perversity
they
all
say
that
all
the
charming
women
but
i
should
have
looked
for
it
from
you
nick
replied
i
given
you
such
an
example
of
what
i
can
do
in
another
line
do
you
mean
my
portrait
oh
i
got
it
with
your
name
and
in
the
corner
and
that
precisely
why
i
content
in
the
corner
of
a
picture
is
delightful
but
i
want
to
break
the
mould
i
do
in
the
least
insist
on
your
giving
specimens
to
others
and
the
artistic
life
when
you
can
lead
another
if
you
any
alternative
however
modest
is
a
very
poor
business
it
comes
last
in
dignity
after
everything
else
ai
i
up
to
my
eyes
in
it
and
do
i
truly
know
you
talk
like
my
mother
said
nick
does
she
hate
it
so
intensely
she
has
the
darkest
ideas
about
it
the
wildest
theories
i
imagine
where
she
gets
them
partly
i
think
from
a
general
conviction
that
the
a
horrible
insidious
foreign
disease
is
eating
the
healthy
core
out
of
english
life
dear
old
english
life
and
partly
from
the
charming
pictures
in
and
the
clever
satirical
articles
pointing
at
mysterious
depths
of
contamination
in
the
other
weekly
papers
she
believes
there
a
dreadful
coterie
of
uncannily
artful
and
desperately
refined
people
who
wear
a
kind
of
loose
faded
uniform
and
worship
only
beauty
which
is
a
fearful
thing
that
gabriel
has
introduced
me
to
it
that
i
now
spend
all
my
time
in
it
and
that
for
its
sweet
sake
i
broken
the
most
sacred
vows
poor
gabriel
who
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
is
in
any
sort
of
society
however
bad
but
i
uncannily
artful
nash
objected
and
though
i
ca
afford
the
uniform
i
believe
you
get
it
best
somewhere
in
south
audley
street
i
do
worship
beauty
i
really
think
it
me
the
weekly
papers
mean
oh
i
read
the
articles
i
know
the
sort
said
basil
dashwood
miriam
looked
at
him
go
and
see
if
the
brougham
there
i
ordered
it
early
dashwood
without
moving
consulted
his
watch
it
is
time
yet
i
know
more
about
the
brougham
than
you
i
made
a
ripping
good
arrangement
for
her
stable
it
really
costs
her
nothing
the
young
actor
continued
confidentially
to
peter
near
whom
he
had
placed
himself
your
mother
quite
right
to
be
miriam
declared
and
i
can
imagine
exactly
what
she
has
been
through
i
should
like
to
talk
with
her
i
should
like
to
see
her
nick
showed
on
this
easy
amusement
reminding
her
she
had
talked
to
him
while
she
sat
for
her
portrait
in
quite
the
opposite
sense
most
helpfully
and
inspiringly
and
nash
explained
that
she
was
studying
the
part
of
a
political
duchess
and
wished
to
take
observations
for
it
to
work
herself
into
the
character
the
girl
might
in
fact
have
been
a
political
duchess
as
she
sat
her
head
erect
and
her
gloved
hands
folded
smiling
with
aristocratic
dimness
at
nick
she
shook
her
head
with
stately
sadness
she
might
have
been
trying
some
effect
for
mary
stuart
in
schiller
play
changed
since
that
i
want
you
to
be
the
grandest
thing
there
is
the
counsellor
of
kings
peter
wondered
if
it
possibly
were
since
she
had
met
his
sister
in
nick
studio
that
she
had
changed
if
perhaps
she
had
seen
how
it
might
give
julia
the
sense
of
being
more
effectually
routed
to
know
that
the
woman
who
had
thrown
the
bomb
was
one
who
also
tried
to
keep
nick
in
the
straight
path
this
indeed
would
involve
an
assumption
that
julia
might
know
whereas
it
was
perfectly
possible
she
might
and
more
than
possible
that
if
she
should
she
would
care
miriam
essential
fondness
for
trying
different
ways
was
always
there
as
an
adequate
reason
for
any
particular
way
a
truth
which
however
sometimes
only
the
particular
way
from
being
vexatious
to
a
particular
observer
yet
after
all
who
more
esthetic
than
you
and
who
goes
in
more
for
the
beautiful
nick
asked
you
never
so
beautiful
as
when
you
pitch
into
it
oh
i
an
inferior
creature
of
an
inferior
sex
and
i
to
earn
my
bread
as
i
can
i
give
it
all
up
in
a
moment
my
odious
trade
for
an
inducement
and
pray
what
do
you
mean
by
an
inducement
nick
demanded
my
dear
fellow
she
means
you
if
you
give
her
a
permanent
engagement
to
sit
for
you
gabriel
volunteered
what
singularly
crude
questions
you
ask
i
like
the
way
she
talks
dashwood
derisively
said
when
i
gave
up
the
most
brilliant
prospects
of
very
much
the
same
kind
as
dormer
expressly
to
go
on
the
stage
you
an
inferior
creature
too
miriam
promptly
pronounced
miss
rooth
very
hard
to
satisfy
peter
observed
at
this
a
man
of
distinction
slightly
bald
in
evening
dress
with
orders
in
the
corner
of
her
she
has
such
a
personage
ready
made
to
her
hand
and
she
does
so
much
as
look
at
him
am
not
an
inducement
have
i
offered
you
a
permanent
engagement
your
orders
where
are
your
orders
she
returned
with
a
sweet
smile
getting
up
i
shall
be
a
minister
next
year
and
an
ambassador
before
you
know
it
then
i
shall
stick
on
everything
that
can
be
had
and
they
call
mountebanks
cried
the
girl
i
been
so
glad
to
see
you
again
do
you
want
another
sitting
she
went
on
to
nick
as
if
to
take
leave
of
him
as
many
as
you
give
me
i
shall
be
grateful
for
all
he
made
answer
i
should
like
to
do
you
as
you
are
at
present
you
totally
different
from
the
woman
i
painted
you
wonderful
the
comic
muse
she
laughed
well
you
must
wait
till
our
first
nights
are
over
i
les
till
then
there
everything
to
do
and
i
to
do
it
all
that
fellow
good
for
nothing
for
nothing
but
domestic
life
and
she
glanced
at
basil
dashwood
he
has
an
idea
not
one
you
willingly
tell
of
him
though
he
rather
useful
for
the
stables
we
got
stables
now
or
we
try
to
look
as
if
we
had
dashwood
ideas
are
cette
in
ten
days
i
shall
have
more
time
the
comic
muse
never
never
peter
protested
you
not
to
go
smirking
through
the
age
and
down
to
posterity
i
rather
see
you
as
medusa
crowned
with
serpents
that
what
you
look
like
when
you
look
best
that
consoling
when
i
just
bought
a
lovely
new
bonnet
all
red
roses
and
bows
i
forgot
to
tell
you
just
now
that
when
you
an
ambassador
you
may
propose
anything
you
like
miriam
went
on
but
forgive
me
if
i
make
that
condition
seriously
speaking
come
to
me
glittering
with
orders
and
i
shall
probably
succumb
i
ca
resist
stars
and
garters
only
you
must
as
you
say
have
them
all
i
like
to
hear
dormer
talk
the
slang
of
the
studio
like
that
phrase
just
now
it
a
fall
to
a
lower
state
however
when
one
low
one
must
crawl
and
i
crawling
down
to
the
strand
dashwood
see
if
mamma
ready
if
she
is
i
decline
to
wait
you
must
bring
her
in
a
hansom
i
take
dormer
in
the
brougham
i
want
to
talk
with
dormer
he
must
drive
with
me
to
the
theatre
his
situation
full
of
interest
miriam
led
the
way
out
of
the
room
as
she
continued
to
chatter
and
when
she
reached
the
with
the
four
men
in
her
train
the
carriage
had
just
drawn
up
at
the
it
appeared
that
rooth
was
not
ready
and
the
girl
in
spite
of
a
remonstrance
from
nick
who
had
a
sense
of
usurping
the
old
lady
place
repeated
her
injunction
that
she
should
be
brought
on
in
a
cab
gentlemen
hung
about
her
at
the
gate
and
she
insisted
on
nick
taking
his
seat
in
the
brougham
and
taking
it
first
before
she
entered
she
put
her
hand
out
to
peter
and
looking
up
at
him
held
his
own
kindly
dear
old
master
are
you
coming
i
miss
you
when
you
not
there
do
go
do
go
it
too
much
nash
freely
declared
she
is
wonderful
said
dashwood
all
expert
admiration
she
gone
into
the
rehearsals
tooth
and
nail
but
nothing
takes
it
out
of
her
nothing
puts
it
into
you
my
dear
miriam
returned
then
she
pursued
to
peter
you
the
faithful
one
you
the
one
i
count
on
he
was
not
looking
at
her
his
eyes
travelled
into
the
carriage
where
they
rested
on
nick
dormer
established
on
the
farther
seat
with
his
face
turned
toward
the
farther
window
he
was
the
one
faithful
or
no
counted
on
or
no
whom
a
charming
woman
had
preferred
to
carry
off
and
there
was
clear
triumph
for
him
in
that
fact
yet
it
pleased
it
somewhat
relieved
his
kinsman
to
see
his
passivity
as
not
a
little
foolish
miriam
noted
something
of
this
in
peter
eyes
for
she
exclaimed
abruptly
do
kill
him
he
does
care
for
me
with
which
she
passed
into
the
carriage
and
let
it
roll
away
peter
stood
watching
it
till
he
heard
dashwood
again
beside
him
you
would
believe
what
i
make
him
do
the
whole
thing
for
a
little
rascal
i
know
take
good
care
of
rooth
said
gabriel
nash
waving
a
bland
farewell
to
the
young
actor
he
gave
a
smiling
survey
of
the
heavens
and
remarked
to
sherringham
that
the
rain
had
stopped
was
he
walking
was
he
driving
should
they
be
going
in
the
same
direction
peter
cared
little
about
his
direction
and
had
little
account
of
it
to
give
he
simply
moved
away
in
silence
and
with
gabriel
at
his
side
this
converser
was
partly
an
affliction
to
him
indeed
the
fact
that
he
could
only
make
light
of
him
added
to
the
oppression
it
was
just
to
him
nevertheless
to
note
that
he
could
hold
his
peace
occasionally
he
had
for
instance
this
afternoon
taken
little
part
in
the
talk
at
balaklava
place
peter
greatly
disliked
to
speak
to
him
of
miriam
but
he
liked
nash
himself
to
make
free
with
her
and
even
liked
him
to
say
such
things
as
might
be
a
little
viciously
and
unguardedly
contradicted
he
was
not
however
moved
to
gainsay
something
dropped
by
his
companion
disconnectedly
at
the
end
of
a
few
minutes
a
word
to
the
effect
that
she
was
after
all
the
soul
alive
all
the
same
nash
added
it
would
do
for
her
to
take
possession
of
a
nice
life
like
nick
and
he
repeated
that
for
his
part
he
would
never
allow
it
it
would
be
on
his
conscience
to
interfere
to
which
peter
returned
disingenuously
that
they
might
all
do
as
they
liked
it
did
matter
a
button
to
and
with
an
effort
to
carry
off
that
comedy
he
changed
the
subject
xxxviii
he
would
for
a
moment
have
admitted
that
he
was
jealous
of
his
old
comrade
but
would
almost
have
liked
to
be
accused
of
it
for
this
would
have
given
him
a
chance
he
rather
lacked
and
missed
the
right
occasion
to
declare
with
plausibility
that
motives
he
could
avow
had
no
application
to
his
case
how
could
a
man
be
jealous
when
he
was
not
a
suitor
how
could
he
pretend
to
guard
a
property
which
was
neither
his
own
nor
destined
to
become
his
own
there
could
be
no
question
of
loss
when
one
had
nothing
at
stake
and
no
question
of
envy
when
the
responsibility
of
possession
was
exactly
what
one
prayed
to
be
delivered
from
the
measure
of
one
susceptibility
was
one
pretensions
and
peter
was
not
only
ready
to
declare
over
and
over
again
that
thank
god
he
had
none
his
spiritual
detachment
was
still
more
complete
he
literally
suffered
from
the
fact
that
nobody
appeared
to
care
to
hear
him
say
it
he
connected
an
idea
of
virtue
and
honour
with
his
attitude
since
surely
it
was
a
high
case
of
conduct
to
have
quenched
a
personal
passion
for
the
good
of
the
public
service
he
had
gone
over
the
whole
question
at
odd
irrepressible
hours
he
had
returned
spiritually
speaking
the
buffet
administered
to
him
all
at
once
that
day
in
rosedale
road
by
the
spectacle
of
the
with
which
nick
could
let
worldly
glories
slide
resolution
for
resolution
he
preferred
after
all
another
sort
and
his
own
would
be
shown
in
the
way
he
should
stick
to
his
profession
and
stand
up
for
british
interests
if
nick
had
leaped
over
a
wall
he
would
leap
over
a
river
the
course
of
his
river
was
already
traced
and
his
loins
were
already
girded
thus
he
was
justified
in
holding
that
the
measure
of
a
man
susceptibility
was
a
man
attitude
that
was
the
only
thing
he
was
bound
to
give
an
account
of
he
was
perpetually
giving
an
account
of
it
to
his
own
soul
in
default
of
other
listeners
he
was
quite
angry
at
having
tasted
a
sweetness
in
miriam
assurance
at
the
carriage
door
bestowed
indeed
with
very
little
solemnity
that
nick
did
care
for
her
wherein
did
it
concern
him
that
nick
cared
for
her
or
that
nick
did
wherein
did
it
signify
to
him
that
gabriel
nash
should
have
taken
upon
himself
to
disapprove
of
a
union
between
the
young
actress
and
the
young
painter
and
to
frustrate
an
accident
that
might
perhaps
prove
fortunate
for
those
had
also
been
cooling
words
at
the
hour
though
peter
blushed
on
the
morrow
to
think
that
he
felt
in
them
anything
but
nash
personal
sublimity
he
was
ashamed
of
having
been
refreshed
and
refreshed
by
so
sickly
a
draught
it
being
all
his
theory
that
he
was
not
in
a
fever
as
for
keeping
an
eye
on
nick
it
would
soon
become
clear
to
that
young
man
and
that
young
man
charming
friend
that
he
had
quite
other
uses
for
his
eyes
the
pair
with
nash
to
help
might
straighten
out
their
complications
according
to
their
light
he
would
never
speak
to
nick
of
miriam
he
felt
indeed
just
now
as
if
he
should
never
speak
to
nick
of
anything
he
had
traced
the
course
of
his
river
as
i
say
and
the
real
proof
would
be
in
the
way
he
should
clearing
the
air
land
on
the
opposite
bank
it
was
a
case
for
action
for
vigorous
unmistakable
action
he
had
done
very
little
since
his
arrival
in
london
but
moon
round
a
de
who
was
taken
up
partly
though
she
bluffed
it
off
with
another
man
and
partly
with
arranging
new
petticoats
for
a
beastly
old
poetic
drama
but
this
little
waste
of
time
should
instantly
be
made
up
he
had
given
himself
a
definite
rope
and
he
had
danced
to
the
end
of
his
rope
and
now
he
would
dance
back
that
was
all
right
so
right
that
peter
could
only
express
to
himself
how
right
it
was
by
whistling
with
extravagance
he
whistled
as
he
went
to
dine
with
a
great
personage
the
day
after
his
meeting
with
nick
in
balaklava
place
a
great
personage
to
whom
he
had
originally
paid
his
respects
it
was
high
time
the
day
before
that
meeting
the
previous
monday
the
sense
of
omissions
to
repair
of
a
superior
line
to
take
perhaps
made
him
study
with
more
zeal
to
please
the
personage
who
gave
him
ten
minutes
and
asked
him
five
questions
a
great
many
doors
were
successively
opened
before
any
palpitating
pilgrim
who
was
about
to
enter
the
presence
of
this
distinguished
man
but
they
were
discreetly
closed
again
behind
sherringham
and
i
must
ask
the
reader
to
pause
with
me
at
the
nearer
end
of
the
momentary
vista
this
particular
pilgrim
fortunately
felt
he
could
count
on
recognition
not
only
as
a
faithful
if
obscure
official
in
the
great
hierarchy
but
as
a
clever
young
man
who
happened
to
be
connected
by
blood
with
people
his
lordship
had
intimately
known
no
doubt
it
was
simply
as
the
clever
young
man
that
peter
received
the
next
morning
from
the
dispenser
of
his
lordship
hospitality
a
note
asking
him
to
dine
on
the
morrow
such
cards
had
come
to
him
before
and
he
had
always
obeyed
their
call
he
did
so
at
present
however
with
a
sense
of
unusual
intention
in
due
course
his
intention
was
translated
into
words
before
the
gentlemen
left
the
he
respectfully
asked
his
noble
host
for
some
further
brief
and
benevolent
hearing
what
is
it
you
want
tell
me
now
the
master
of
his
fate
replied
motioning
to
the
rest
of
the
company
to
pass
out
and
detaining
him
where
they
stood
peter
excellent
training
covered
every
contingency
he
could
always
be
as
concise
or
as
diffuse
as
the
occasion
required
even
he
himself
however
was
surprised
at
the
quick
felicity
of
the
terms
in
which
he
was
conscious
of
conveying
that
were
it
compatible
with
higher
conveniences
he
should
extremely
like
to
be
transferred
to
duties
in
a
more
distant
quarter
of
the
globe
indeed
fond
as
he
was
of
thinking
himself
a
man
of
emotions
controlled
by
civility
it
is
not
impossible
that
a
greater
candour
than
he
knew
glimmered
through
peter
expression
and
trembled
through
his
tone
as
he
presented
this
petition
he
had
aimed
at
a
good
manner
in
presenting
it
but
perhaps
the
best
of
the
effect
produced
for
his
interlocutor
was
just
where
it
failed
where
it
confessed
a
secret
that
the
highest
diplomacy
would
have
guarded
sherringham
remarked
to
the
minister
that
he
did
care
in
the
least
where
the
place
might
be
nor
how
little
coveted
a
post
the
further
away
the
better
and
the
climate
did
matter
he
would
only
prefer
of
course
that
there
should
be
really
something
to
do
though
he
would
make
the
best
of
it
even
if
there
were
not
he
stopped
in
time
or
at
least
thought
he
did
not
to
betray
his
covertly
seeking
relief
from
minding
his
having
been
jilted
in
a
flight
to
latitudes
unfavourable
to
human
life
his
august
patron
gave
him
a
sharp
look
which
for
a
moment
seemed
the
precursor
of
a
sharper
question
but
the
moment
elapsed
and
the
question
failed
to
come
this
considerate
omission
characteristic
of
a
true
man
of
the
world
and
representing
quick
guesses
and
still
quicker
indifferences
made
our
gentleman
from
that
moment
his
lordship
ardent
partisan
what
did
come
was
a
laugh
and
the
exclamation
you
know
there
are
plenty
of
swamps
and
jungles
if
you
want
that
sort
of
thing
peter
replied
that
it
was
very
much
that
sort
of
thing
he
did
want
whereupon
his
chief
continued
i
see
i
see
if
anything
turns
up
you
shall
hear
something
turned
up
the
very
next
day
our
young
man
taken
at
his
word
found
himself
indebted
to
the
postman
for
a
note
of
concise
intimation
that
the
high
position
of
minister
to
the
smallest
of
central
american
republics
would
be
apportioned
him
the
republic
though
small
was
big
enough
to
be
shaky
and
the
position
though
high
not
so
exalted
that
there
were
not
much
greater
altitudes
above
it
to
which
it
was
a
peter
quite
ready
to
take
one
thing
with
another
rejoiced
at
his
easy
triumph
reflected
that
he
must
have
been
even
more
noticed
at
headquarters
than
he
had
hoped
and
on
the
spot
consulting
nobody
and
waiting
for
nothing
signified
his
unqualified
acceptance
of
the
place
nobody
with
a
grain
of
sense
would
have
advised
him
to
do
anything
else
it
made
him
happier
than
he
had
supposed
he
should
ever
be
again
it
made
him
feel
professionally
in
the
train
as
they
said
in
paris
it
was
serious
it
was
interesting
it
was
exciting
and
his
imagination
letting
itself
loose
into
the
future
began
once
more
to
scale
the
crowning
eminence
it
was
very
simple
to
hold
one
course
if
one
really
tried
and
he
blessed
the
variety
of
peoples
further
communications
passed
the
last
enjoining
on
him
to
return
to
paris
for
a
short
interval
a
week
later
after
which
he
would
be
advised
of
the
date
for
his
proceeding
to
his
remoter
duties
xxxix
the
next
thing
he
meanwhile
did
was
to
call
with
his
news
on
lady
agnes
dormer
it
is
not
unworthy
of
note
that
he
took
on
the
other
hand
no
step
to
make
his
promotion
known
to
miriam
rooth
to
render
it
probable
he
should
find
his
aunt
he
went
at
the
and
she
was
indeed
on
the
point
of
sitting
down
to
that
repast
with
grace
biddy
was
not
at
home
biddy
was
never
at
home
now
her
mother
said
she
was
always
at
nick
place
she
spent
her
life
there
she
ate
and
drank
there
she
almost
slept
there
what
she
contrived
to
do
there
for
so
many
hours
and
what
was
the
irresistible
spell
lady
agnes
could
pretend
she
had
succeeded
in
discovering
she
spoke
of
this
baleful
resort
only
as
nick
place
and
spoke
of
it
at
first
as
little
as
possible
she
judged
highly
probable
however
that
biddy
would
come
in
early
that
afternoon
there
was
something
or
other
some
common
social
duty
she
had
condescended
to
promise
she
would
perform
with
grace
poor
lady
agnes
whom
peter
found
somehow
at
once
grim
and
very
prostrate
she
assured
her
nephew
her
nerves
were
all
gone
almost
abused
her
younger
daughter
for
two
minutes
having
evidently
a
need
of
abusing
some
one
i
must
yet
add
that
she
did
wait
to
meet
grace
eye
before
recovering
by
a
rapid
gyration
her
view
of
the
possibilities
of
things
those
possibilities
from
which
she
still
might
squeeze
as
a
parent
almost
in
despair
the
drop
that
would
sweeten
her
cup
dear
child
she
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
subjoin
her
only
fault
is
after
all
that
she
adores
her
brother
she
has
a
capacity
for
adoration
and
must
always
take
her
gospel
from
some
one
grace
declared
to
peter
that
her
sister
would
have
stayed
at
home
if
she
had
dreamed
he
was
coming
and
lady
agnes
let
him
know
that
she
had
heard
all
about
the
hour
he
had
spent
with
the
poor
child
at
place
and
about
his
extraordinary
good
nature
in
taking
the
two
girls
to
the
play
peter
lunched
in
calcutta
gardens
spending
an
hour
there
which
proved
at
first
unexpectedly
and
as
seemed
to
him
unfairly
dismal
he
knew
from
his
own
general
perceptions
from
what
biddy
had
told
him
and
from
what
he
had
heard
nick
say
in
balaklava
place
that
his
aunt
would
have
been
wounded
by
her
son
apostasy
but
it
was
not
till
he
saw
her
that
he
appreciated
the
dark
difference
this
young
behaviour
had
made
in
the
outlook
of
his
family
evidently
that
behaviour
had
sprung
a
dreadful
leak
in
the
great
vessel
of
their
hopes
these
were
things
no
outsider
could
measure
and
they
were
none
of
an
outsider
business
it
was
enough
that
lady
agnes
struck
him
really
as
a
woman
who
had
received
her
she
looked
ten
years
older
she
was
white
and
haggard
and
tragic
her
eyes
burned
with
a
strange
fitful
fire
that
prompted
one
to
conclude
her
children
had
better
look
out
for
her
when
not
filled
with
this
unnatural
flame
they
were
suffused
with
comfortless
tears
and
altogether
the
afflicted
lady
was
as
he
viewed
her
very
bad
a
case
for
anxiety
it
was
because
he
had
known
she
would
be
very
bad
that
he
had
in
his
kindness
called
on
her
exactly
in
this
manner
but
he
recognised
that
to
undertake
to
be
kind
to
her
in
proportion
to
her
need
might
carry
one
very
far
he
was
glad
he
had
not
himself
a
wronged
mad
mother
and
he
wondered
how
nick
could
bear
the
burden
of
the
home
he
had
ruined
apparently
he
did
bear
it
very
far
but
had
taken
final
convenient
refuge
in
rosedale
road
peter
judgement
of
his
perverse
cousin
was
considerably
confused
and
not
the
less
so
for
the
consciousness
that
he
was
perhaps
just
now
not
in
the
best
state
of
mind
for
judging
him
at
all
at
the
same
time
though
he
held
in
general
that
a
man
of
sense
has
always
warrant
enough
in
his
sense
for
doing
the
particular
thing
he
prefers
he
could
scarcely
help
asking
himself
whether
in
the
exercise
of
a
virile
freedom
it
had
been
absolutely
indispensable
nick
should
work
such
domestic
woe
he
admitted
indeed
that
that
was
an
anomalous
figure
for
nick
the
worker
of
domestic
woe
then
he
saw
that
his
grievance
there
came
a
moment
later
when
she
asserted
as
much
was
not
quite
what
her
recreant
child
in
balaklava
place
had
represented
it
with
questionable
taste
perhaps
to
a
mocking
actress
was
not
a
mere
shocked
quarrel
with
his
adoption
of
a
low
career
or
a
horror
the
horror
of
the
licences
taken
by
artists
under
pretext
of
being
conscientious
the
day
for
this
was
past
and
english
society
thought
the
brush
and
the
fiddle
as
good
as
anything
else
with
two
or
three
exceptions
it
was
not
what
he
had
taken
up
but
what
he
had
put
down
that
made
the
sorry
difference
and
the
tragedy
would
have
been
equally
great
if
he
had
become
a
or
a
peter
had
gathered
at
first
that
lady
agnes
would
trust
herself
to
speak
directly
of
her
trouble
and
he
had
obeyed
what
he
supposed
the
best
discretion
in
making
no
allusion
to
it
but
a
few
minutes
before
they
rose
from
table
she
broke
out
and
when
he
attempted
to
utter
a
word
of
mitigation
there
was
something
that
went
to
his
heart
in
the
way
she
returned
oh
you
do
know
you
do
know
he
felt
grace
eyes
fixed
on
him
at
this
instant
in
a
mystery
of
supplication
and
was
uncertain
as
to
what
she
wanted
that
he
should
say
something
more
to
console
her
mother
or
should
hurry
away
from
the
subject
grace
looked
old
and
plain
and
he
had
thought
on
coming
in
rather
cross
but
she
evidently
wanted
something
you
do
know
lady
agnes
repeated
with
a
trembling
voice
you
do
know
she
had
pushed
her
chair
a
little
away
from
her
place
she
held
her
pressed
hard
to
her
mouth
almost
stuffed
into
it
and
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
floor
she
made
him
aware
he
did
virtually
know
know
what
towering
piles
of
confidence
and
hope
had
been
dashed
to
the
earth
then
she
finished
her
sentence
unexpectedly
you
do
know
what
my
life
with
my
great
husband
was
here
on
the
other
hand
peter
was
slightly
at
fault
he
did
exactly
see
what
her
life
with
her
great
husband
had
to
do
with
it
what
was
clear
to
him
however
was
that
they
literally
had
looked
for
things
all
in
the
very
key
of
that
greatness
from
nick
it
was
not
quite
easy
to
see
why
this
had
been
the
case
it
had
not
been
precisely
peter
own
prefigurement
nick
appeared
to
have
had
the
faculty
of
planting
that
sort
of
flattering
faith
in
women
he
had
originally
given
julia
a
tremendous
dose
of
it
though
she
had
since
shaken
off
the
effects
do
you
really
think
he
would
have
done
such
great
things
politically
speaking
peter
risked
do
you
consider
that
the
root
of
the
matter
was
so
essentially
in
him
his
hostess
had
a
pause
looking
at
him
rather
hard
i
only
think
what
all
his
friends
all
his
father
friends
have
thought
he
was
his
father
son
after
all
no
young
man
ever
had
a
finer
training
and
he
gave
from
the
first
repeated
proof
of
the
highest
ability
the
highest
ambition
see
how
he
got
in
everywhere
look
at
his
first
seat
look
at
his
second
lady
agnes
continued
look
at
what
every
one
says
at
this
moment
look
at
all
the
papers
said
grace
did
you
ever
hear
him
speak
she
asked
and
when
peter
reminded
her
how
he
had
spent
his
life
in
foreign
lands
shut
out
from
such
pleasures
she
went
on
well
you
lost
something
it
was
very
charming
said
lady
agnes
quietly
and
poignantly
of
course
he
charming
whatever
he
does
peter
returned
he
be
a
charming
artist
oh
god
help
us
the
poor
lady
groaned
rising
quickly
he
wo
that
the
worst
grace
amended
it
is
as
if
he
do
things
people
would
like
i
been
to
his
place
and
i
never
saw
such
a
horrid
lot
of
things
not
at
all
clever
or
pretty
yet
her
mother
at
this
turned
upon
her
with
sudden
asperity
you
know
nothing
whatever
about
the
matter
then
she
added
for
peter
that
as
it
happened
her
children
did
have
a
good
deal
of
artistic
taste
grace
was
the
only
one
who
was
totally
deficient
in
it
biddy
was
very
clever
biddy
really
might
learn
to
do
pretty
things
and
anything
the
poor
child
could
learn
was
now
no
more
than
her
duty
there
was
so
little
knowing
what
the
future
had
in
store
for
them
all
you
think
too
much
of
the
future
you
take
terribly
gloomy
views
said
peter
looking
for
his
hat
what
other
views
can
one
take
when
one
son
has
deliberately
thrown
away
a
fortune
thrown
one
away
do
you
mean
through
not
marrying
i
mean
through
killing
by
his
perversity
the
best
friend
he
ever
had
peter
stared
a
moment
then
with
laughter
ah
but
julia
is
dead
of
it
i
not
talking
of
julia
said
his
aunt
with
a
good
deal
of
majesty
nick
is
mercenary
and
i
not
complaining
of
that
she
means
carteret
grace
explained
with
all
her
competence
have
done
anything
if
nick
had
stayed
in
the
house
but
he
not
dead
charles
carteret
dying
said
lady
agnes
his
end
dreadfully
near
he
has
been
a
sort
of
providence
to
us
he
was
sir
nicholas
second
self
but
he
wo
put
up
with
such
insanity
such
wickedness
and
that
chapter
closed
you
mean
he
has
dropped
nick
out
of
his
will
cut
him
off
utterly
he
has
given
him
notice
the
old
scoundrel
peter
could
keep
this
back
but
nick
will
work
the
better
for
that
he
depend
on
himself
yes
and
whom
shall
we
depend
on
grace
spoke
up
do
be
vulgar
for
god
sake
her
mother
ejaculated
with
a
certain
inconsequence
oh
leave
nick
alone
he
make
a
lot
of
money
peter
declared
cheerfully
following
his
two
companions
into
the
hall
i
do
in
the
least
care
if
he
does
or
not
said
lady
agnes
you
must
come
upstairs
again
i
lots
to
say
to
you
yet
she
went
on
seeing
him
make
for
his
hat
you
must
arrange
to
come
and
dine
with
us
immediately
it
only
because
i
been
so
steeped
in
misery
that
i
did
write
to
you
the
other
day
directly
after
you
had
called
we
do
give
parties
as
you
may
imagine
but
if
you
come
just
as
we
are
for
old
acquaintance
sake
just
with
nick
if
nick
will
come
and
dear
biddy
grace
interposed
nick
must
certainly
come
as
well
as
dear
biddy
whom
i
hoped
so
much
to
find
peter
pronounced
because
i
going
away
i
do
know
when
i
shall
see
them
again
wait
with
mamma
biddy
will
come
in
now
at
any
moment
grace
urged
you
going
away
said
lady
agnes
pausing
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
turning
her
white
face
upon
him
something
in
her
voice
showed
she
had
been
struck
by
his
own
tone
i
had
promotion
and
you
must
congratulate
me
they
sending
me
out
as
minister
to
a
little
hot
hole
in
central
america
six
thousand
miles
away
i
shall
have
to
go
rather
soon
oh
i
so
glad
lady
agnes
breathed
still
she
paused
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
and
still
she
gazed
how
very
delightful
it
will
lead
straight
off
to
all
sorts
of
other
good
things
grace
a
little
coarsely
commented
oh
i
crawling
up
i
an
excellency
peter
laughed
then
if
you
dine
with
us
your
excellency
must
have
great
people
to
meet
you
nick
and
biddy
they
great
enough
come
upstairs
come
upstairs
said
lady
agnes
turning
quickly
and
beginning
to
ascend
wait
for
biddy
i
going
out
grace
continued
extending
her
hand
to
her
kinsman
i
shall
see
you
again
not
that
you
care
but
now
wait
for
biddy
the
girl
repeated
in
a
lower
tone
fastening
her
eyes
on
his
with
the
same
urgent
mystifying
gleam
he
thought
he
had
noted
at
luncheon
oh
i
go
and
see
her
in
rosedale
road
he
threw
off
do
you
mean
now
i
do
know
about
but
before
i
leave
england
well
she
be
in
immediately
said
grace
to
your
excellency
come
up
peter
come
up
called
lady
agnes
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
he
mounted
and
when
he
found
himself
in
the
with
her
and
the
door
closed
she
expressed
her
great
interest
in
his
fine
prospects
and
position
which
she
wished
to
hear
all
about
she
rang
for
coffee
and
indicated
the
seat
he
would
find
most
comfortable
it
shone
before
him
for
a
moment
that
she
would
tell
him
he
might
if
he
wished
light
a
cigar
for
peter
had
suddenly
become
restless
too
restless
to
occupy
a
comfortable
chair
he
seated
himself
in
it
only
to
jump
up
again
and
he
went
to
the
window
while
he
imparted
to
his
hostess
the
very
little
he
knew
about
his
post
on
hearing
a
vehicle
drive
up
to
the
door
a
strong
light
had
just
been
thrown
into
his
mind
and
it
grew
stronger
when
looking
out
he
saw
grace
dormer
issue
from
the
house
in
a
hat
and
a
jacket
which
had
all
the
air
of
having
been
assumed
with
extraordinary
speed
her
jacket
was
unbuttoned
and
her
gloves
still
dangling
from
the
hands
with
which
she
was
settling
her
hat
the
vehicle
into
which
she
hastily
sprang
was
a
which
had
been
summoned
by
the
butler
from
the
doorstep
and
which
rolled
away
with
her
after
she
had
given
an
address
where
grace
going
in
such
a
hurry
he
asked
of
lady
agnes
to
which
she
replied
that
she
had
the
least
idea
her
children
at
the
pass
they
had
all
come
to
knocked
about
as
they
liked
well
he
sat
down
again
he
stayed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
then
he
stayed
longer
and
during
this
time
his
appreciation
of
what
she
had
in
her
mind
gathered
force
she
showed
him
that
precious
quantity
clearly
enough
though
she
showed
it
by
no
clumsy
no
voluntary
arts
it
looked
out
of
her
sombre
conscious
eyes
and
quavered
in
her
preoccupied
perfunctory
tones
she
took
an
extravagant
interest
in
his
future
proceedings
the
probable
succession
of
events
in
his
career
the
different
honours
he
would
be
likely
to
come
in
for
the
salary
attached
to
his
actual
appointment
the
salary
attached
to
the
appointments
that
would
follow
they
would
be
sure
to
would
they
and
what
he
might
reasonably
expect
to
save
oh
he
must
save
lady
agnes
was
an
advocate
of
saving
and
he
must
take
tremendous
pains
and
get
on
and
be
clever
and
fiercely
ambitious
he
must
make
himself
indispensable
and
rise
to
the
top
she
was
urgent
and
suggestive
and
sympathetic
she
threw
herself
into
the
vision
of
his
achievements
and
emoluments
as
if
to
appease
a
little
the
sore
hunger
with
which
nick
treachery
had
left
her
this
was
touching
to
her
nephew
who
did
remain
unmoved
even
at
those
more
importunate
moments
when
as
she
fell
into
silence
fidgeting
feverishly
with
a
morsel
of
she
had
plucked
from
a
table
her
whole
presence
became
an
intense
repressed
appeal
to
him
what
that
appeal
would
have
been
had
it
been
uttered
was
oh
peter
take
little
biddy
oh
my
dear
young
friend
understand
your
interests
at
the
same
time
that
you
understand
mine
be
kind
and
reasonable
and
clever
save
me
all
further
anxiety
and
tribulation
and
accept
my
lovely
faultless
child
from
my
hands
that
was
what
lady
agnes
had
always
meant
more
or
less
that
was
what
grace
had
meant
and
they
meant
it
with
singular
lucidity
on
the
present
occasion
lady
agnes
meant
it
so
much
that
from
one
moment
to
another
he
scarce
knew
what
she
might
do
and
grace
meant
it
so
much
that
she
had
rushed
away
in
a
hansom
to
fetch
her
sister
from
the
studio
grace
however
was
a
fool
for
biddy
certainly
would
come
the
news
of
his
promotion
had
started
them
off
adding
point
to
their
idea
of
his
being
an
excellent
match
bringing
home
to
them
sharply
the
sense
that
if
he
were
going
away
to
strange
countries
he
must
take
biddy
with
him
that
something
at
all
events
must
be
settled
about
biddy
before
he
went
they
had
suddenly
begun
to
throb
poor
things
with
alarm
at
the
ebbing
hours
strangely
enough
the
perception
of
all
this
had
the
effect
of
throwing
him
on
the
defensive
and
still
less
that
of
making
him
wish
to
bolt
when
once
he
had
made
sure
what
was
in
the
air
he
recognised
a
propriety
a
real
felicity
in
it
could
deny
that
he
was
in
certain
ways
a
good
match
since
it
was
quite
probable
he
would
go
far
and
was
even
generous
enough
as
he
had
no
fear
of
being
materially
dragged
to
the
altar
to
enter
into
the
conception
that
he
might
offer
some
balm
to
a
mother
who
had
had
a
horrid
disappointment
the
feasibility
of
marrying
biddy
was
not
exactly
augmented
by
the
idea
that
his
doing
so
would
be
a
great
offset
to
what
nick
had
made
lady
agnes
suffer
but
at
least
peter
did
dislike
his
strenuous
aunt
so
much
as
to
wish
to
punish
her
for
her
nature
he
was
not
afraid
of
her
whatever
she
might
do
and
though
unable
to
grasp
the
practical
relevancy
of
biddy
being
produced
on
the
instant
was
willing
to
linger
half
an
hour
on
the
chance
of
successful
production
there
was
meanwhile
moreover
a
certain
contagion
in
lady
appeal
it
made
him
appeal
sensibly
to
himself
since
indeed
as
it
is
time
to
say
the
glass
of
our
young
man
spirit
had
been
polished
for
that
reflexion
it
was
only
at
this
moment
really
that
he
became
inwardly
candid
while
making
up
his
mind
that
his
only
safety
was
in
flight
and
taking
the
strong
measure
of
a
request
for
help
toward
it
he
was
yet
very
conscious
that
another
and
probably
still
more
effectual
safeguard
especially
if
the
two
should
be
conjoined
lay
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
his
sister
words
in
paris
had
come
back
to
him
and
had
seemed
still
wiser
than
when
uttered
she
save
you
disappointments
you
know
the
worst
that
can
happen
to
you
and
it
would
be
bad
julia
had
put
it
into
a
nutshell
biddy
would
probably
save
him
disappointments
and
then
she
was
well
she
was
biddy
peter
knew
better
what
that
was
since
the
hour
he
had
spent
with
her
in
rosedale
road
but
he
had
brushed
away
the
sense
of
it
though
aware
that
in
doing
so
he
took
only
and
was
even
guilty
of
a
sort
of
fraud
upon
himself
if
he
was
sincere
in
wishing
to
put
a
gulf
between
his
future
and
that
sad
expanse
of
his
past
and
present
over
which
miriam
had
cast
her
shadow
there
was
a
very
simple
way
to
do
so
he
had
dodged
this
way
dishonestly
fixing
on
another
which
taken
alone
was
far
from
being
so
good
but
lady
agnes
brought
him
back
to
it
she
held
him
in
confused
contemplation
of
it
during
which
the
safety
as
julia
had
called
it
of
the
remedy
wrought
upon
him
as
he
have
believed
beforehand
and
not
least
to
the
effect
of
sweetening
of
prettily
colouring
the
pill
it
would
be
simple
and
it
would
deal
with
all
his
problems
it
would
put
an
end
to
all
alternatives
which
as
alternatives
were
otherwise
putting
an
end
to
him
would
be
an
excellent
thing
it
would
settle
the
whole
question
of
his
future
and
it
was
high
time
this
should
be
settled
peter
took
two
cups
of
coffee
while
he
made
out
his
future
with
lady
agnes
but
though
he
drank
them
slowly
he
had
finished
them
before
biddy
turned
up
he
stayed
of
an
hour
saying
to
himself
she
would
come
why
should
she
come
lady
agnes
stooped
to
no
avowal
she
really
stooped
so
far
as
bald
words
went
to
no
part
of
the
business
but
she
made
him
fix
the
next
day
save
one
for
coming
to
dinner
and
her
repeated
declaration
that
there
would
be
no
one
else
not
another
creature
but
themselves
had
almost
the
force
of
the
supplied
form
for
a
promise
to
pay
in
giving
his
word
that
he
would
come
without
fail
and
not
write
the
next
day
to
throw
them
over
for
some
function
he
should
choose
to
dub
obligatory
he
felt
quite
as
if
he
were
putting
his
name
to
such
a
document
he
went
away
at
three
biddy
of
course
had
come
and
he
had
been
sure
she
would
he
could
imagine
what
grace
idea
had
been
nor
what
pretext
she
had
put
forward
to
her
sister
whatever
these
things
biddy
had
seen
through
them
and
hated
them
peter
could
but
like
her
the
more
for
that
xl
lady
agnes
would
doubtless
have
done
better
in
her
own
interest
or
in
that
of
her
child
to
have
secured
his
company
for
the
very
next
evening
this
she
had
indeed
attempted
but
her
application
of
her
thought
had
miscarried
peter
bethinking
himself
that
he
was
importantly
engaged
her
ladyship
moreover
could
presume
to
answer
for
nick
since
after
all
they
must
of
course
nick
though
to
tell
the
truth
the
hideous
truth
she
and
her
son
were
scarcely
on
terms
peter
insisted
on
nick
wished
particularly
to
see
him
and
gave
his
hostess
notice
that
he
would
make
each
of
them
forgive
everything
to
the
other
she
returned
that
all
her
son
had
to
forgive
was
her
loving
him
more
than
her
life
and
she
would
have
challenged
peter
had
he
allowed
it
on
the
general
ground
of
the
comparative
dignity
of
the
two
arts
of
painting
portraits
and
governing
nations
our
friend
declined
the
challenge
the
most
he
did
was
to
intimate
that
he
perhaps
saw
nick
more
vividly
as
a
painter
than
as
a
governor
later
he
remembered
vaguely
something
his
aunt
had
said
about
their
being
a
governing
family
he
was
going
by
what
he
could
ascertain
to
a
very
queer
climate
and
had
many
preparations
to
make
he
gave
his
best
attention
to
these
and
for
a
couple
of
hours
after
leaving
lady
agnes
rummaged
london
for
books
from
which
he
might
extract
information
about
his
new
habitat
it
made
apparently
no
great
figure
in
literature
and
peter
could
reflect
that
he
was
perhaps
destined
to
find
a
salutary
distraction
in
himself
filling
the
void
with
a
volume
of
impressions
after
he
had
resigned
himself
to
necessary
ignorance
he
went
into
the
park
he
treated
himself
to
an
afternoon
or
two
there
when
he
happened
to
drop
upon
london
in
summer
it
refreshed
his
sense
of
the
british
interests
he
would
have
to
stand
up
for
moreover
he
had
been
hiding
more
or
less
and
now
all
that
was
changed
and
this
was
the
simplest
way
not
to
hide
he
met
a
host
of
friends
made
his
situation
as
public
as
possible
and
accepted
on
the
spot
a
great
many
invitations
all
subject
however
to
the
mental
reservation
that
he
should
allow
none
of
them
to
interfere
with
his
being
present
the
first
night
of
miriam
new
venture
he
was
going
to
the
equator
to
get
away
from
her
but
to
repudiate
the
past
with
some
decency
of
form
he
must
show
an
affected
interest
if
he
could
muster
none
other
in
an
occasion
that
meant
so
much
for
her
the
least
intimate
of
her
associates
would
do
that
and
peter
remembered
how
at
the
expense
of
good
manners
he
had
stayed
away
from
her
first
appearance
on
any
stage
at
all
he
would
have
been
shocked
had
he
found
himself
obliged
to
go
back
to
paris
without
giving
her
at
the
imminent
crisis
the
personal
countenance
she
had
so
good
a
right
to
expect
it
was
nearly
eight
when
he
went
to
great
stanhope
street
to
dress
for
dinner
and
learn
that
a
note
awaiting
him
on
the
and
which
bore
the
marks
of
hasty
despatch
had
come
three
or
four
hours
before
it
exhibited
the
signature
of
miriam
rooth
and
let
him
know
that
she
positively
expected
him
at
the
theatre
by
eleven
the
next
morning
for
which
hour
a
of
the
revived
play
had
been
hurriedly
projected
the
first
night
being
now
definitely
fixed
for
the
impending
saturday
she
counted
on
his
attendance
at
both
ceremonies
but
with
particular
reasons
for
wishing
to
see
him
in
the
morning
i
want
you
to
see
and
judge
and
tell
me
she
said
for
my
mind
like
a
flogged
horse
it
wo
give
another
kick
it
was
for
the
saturday
he
had
made
lady
agnes
his
promise
he
had
thought
of
the
possibility
of
the
play
in
doing
so
but
had
rested
in
the
faith
that
from
valid
symptoms
this
complication
would
not
occur
till
the
following
week
he
decided
nothing
on
the
spot
as
to
the
conflict
of
occupations
it
was
enough
to
send
miriam
three
words
to
the
effect
that
he
would
sooner
perish
than
fail
her
on
the
morrow
he
went
to
the
theatre
in
the
morning
and
the
episode
proved
curious
and
instructive
though
there
were
twenty
people
in
the
stalls
it
bore
little
resemblance
to
those
to
which
in
paris
his
love
of
the
drama
had
often
attracted
him
and
which
taking
place
at
night
in
the
theatre
closed
to
the
public
are
virtually
first
performances
with
invited
spectators
they
were
to
his
sense
always
settled
and
stately
rehearsals
of
the
even
more
than
rehearsals
of
the
play
the
present
occasion
was
less
august
it
was
not
so
much
a
concert
as
a
confusion
of
sounds
and
it
took
audible
and
at
times
disputatious
counsel
with
itself
it
was
rough
and
frank
and
spasmodic
but
was
lively
and
vivid
and
in
spite
of
the
serious
character
of
the
piece
often
exceedingly
droll
while
it
gave
sherringham
oddly
enough
a
more
present
sense
than
ever
of
bending
over
the
hissing
smoking
sputtering
caldron
in
which
a
palatable
performance
is
stewed
he
looked
into
the
gross
darkness
that
may
result
from
excess
of
light
that
is
he
understood
how
knocked
up
on
the
eve
of
production
every
one
concerned
in
the
preparation
of
a
piece
might
be
with
nerves
overstretched
and
glasses
blurred
awaiting
the
test
and
the
response
the
echo
to
be
given
back
by
the
big
receptive
artless
stupid
delightful
public
peter
interest
had
been
great
in
advance
and
as
miriam
since
his
arrival
had
taken
him
much
into
her
confidence
he
knew
what
she
intended
to
do
and
had
discussed
a
hundred
points
with
her
they
had
differed
about
some
of
them
and
she
had
always
said
ah
but
wait
till
you
see
how
i
shall
do
it
at
the
time
that
was
usually
her
principal
reason
and
her
most
convincing
argument
she
had
made
some
changes
at
the
last
hour
she
was
going
to
do
several
things
in
another
way
but
she
wanted
a
touchstone
wanted
a
fresh
ear
and
as
she
told
sherringham
when
he
went
behind
after
the
first
act
that
was
why
she
had
insisted
on
this
private
trial
to
which
a
few
fresh
ears
were
to
be
admitted
they
did
want
to
allow
it
her
the
theatre
people
they
were
such
a
parcel
of
donkeys
but
as
to
what
she
meant
in
general
to
insist
on
she
had
given
them
a
hint
she
flattered
herself
they
would
soon
forget
she
spoke
as
if
she
had
had
a
great
battle
with
her
and
had
routed
them
utterly
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
heard
her
talk
as
if
such
a
life
as
hers
could
only
be
a
fighting
life
and
of
her
frank
measure
of
the
fine
uses
of
a
faculty
for
making
a
row
she
rejoiced
she
possessed
this
faculty
for
she
knew
what
to
do
with
it
and
though
there
might
be
a
certain
swagger
in
taking
such
a
stand
in
advance
when
one
had
done
the
infinitely
little
she
had
yet
done
she
nevertheless
trusted
to
the
future
to
show
how
right
she
should
have
been
in
believing
a
pack
of
idiots
would
never
hold
out
against
her
and
would
know
they
could
afford
to
her
assumption
of
course
was
that
she
fought
for
the
light
and
the
right
for
the
good
way
and
the
thorough
for
doing
a
thing
properly
if
one
did
it
at
all
what
she
had
really
wanted
was
the
theatre
closed
for
a
night
and
the
put
on
for
a
few
people
given
instead
of
that
she
had
not
got
but
she
would
have
it
the
next
time
she
spoke
as
if
her
triumphs
behind
the
scenes
as
well
as
before
would
go
by
leaps
and
bounds
and
he
could
perfectly
see
for
the
time
that
she
would
drive
her
coadjutors
in
front
of
her
like
sheep
her
tone
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
would
have
struck
one
as
preposterous
if
one
had
believed
in
her
but
if
one
did
so
believe
it
only
seemed
thrown
in
with
the
other
gifts
how
was
she
going
to
act
that
night
and
what
could
be
said
for
such
a
hateful
way
of
doing
things
she
thrust
on
poor
peter
questions
he
was
all
unable
to
answer
she
abounded
in
superlatives
and
tremendously
strong
objections
he
had
a
sharper
vision
than
usual
of
the
queer
fate
for
a
peaceable
man
of
being
involved
in
a
life
of
so
violent
a
rhythm
one
might
as
well
be
hooked
to
a
and
whiz
round
in
flame
and
smoke
it
had
only
been
for
five
minutes
in
the
wing
amid
jostling
and
shuffling
and
shoving
that
they
held
this
conference
miriam
splendid
in
a
brocaded
anachronism
a
false
dress
of
the
beginning
of
the
century
and
excited
and
appealing
imperious
reckless
and
full
of
exaggerated
propositions
supreme
determinations
and
comic
irrelevancies
showed
as
radiant
a
young
head
as
the
stage
had
ever
seen
other
people
quickly
surrounded
her
and
peter
saw
that
though
she
wanted
as
she
said
a
fresh
ear
and
a
fresh
eye
she
was
liable
to
rap
out
to
those
who
possessed
these
advantages
that
they
did
know
what
they
were
talking
about
it
was
rather
hard
for
her
victims
basil
dashwood
let
him
into
this
wonderfully
painted
and
in
a
dress
even
more
beautiful
than
miriam
that
of
a
young
dandy
under
charles
the
second
if
you
were
not
in
the
business
you
were
one
kind
of
donkey
and
if
you
in
the
business
you
were
another
kind
peter
noted
with
a
certain
chagrin
that
gabriel
nash
had
failed
he
preferred
to
base
his
annoyance
on
that
ground
when
the
girl
after
the
remark
just
quoted
from
dashwood
laughing
and
saying
that
at
any
rate
the
thing
would
do
because
it
would
just
have
to
do
thrust
vindictively
but
familiarly
into
the
young
actor
face
a
magnificent
feather
fan
he
too
lovely
she
asked
and
does
he
know
how
to
do
it
dashwood
had
the
sense
of
costume
even
more
than
peter
had
inferred
or
supposed
he
minded
inasmuch
as
it
now
appeared
he
had
gone
profoundly
into
the
question
of
what
the
leading
lady
was
to
wear
he
had
drawn
patterns
and
hunted
up
stuffs
had
helped
her
to
try
on
her
clothes
had
bristled
with
ideas
and
pins
it
would
not
have
been
quite
clear
peter
ground
for
resenting
nash
cynical
absence
it
may
even
be
thought
singular
he
should
have
missed
him
at
any
rate
he
flushed
a
little
when
their
young
woman
of
whom
he
inquired
whether
she
had
invited
her
oldest
and
dearest
friend
made
answer
oh
he
says
he
does
like
the
he
only
wants
the
pudding
it
would
have
taken
the
to
account
at
that
point
for
the
red
of
cheek
and
he
was
indeed
uncomfortably
heated
by
helping
to
handle
as
he
phrased
it
the
saucepans
this
he
felt
so
much
after
he
had
returned
to
his
seat
which
he
forbore
to
quit
again
till
the
curtain
had
fallen
on
the
last
act
that
in
spite
of
the
high
beauty
of
that
part
of
the
performance
of
which
miriam
carried
the
weight
there
were
moments
when
his
relief
overflowed
into
gasps
as
if
he
had
been
scrambling
up
the
bank
of
a
torrent
after
an
immersion
the
girl
herself
out
in
the
open
of
her
field
to
win
was
of
the
incorruptible
faith
she
had
been
saturated
to
good
purpose
with
the
great
spirit
of
madame
carré
that
was
conspicuous
while
the
play
went
on
and
she
guarded
the
whole
march
with
fagged
piety
and
passion
sherringham
had
never
liked
the
piece
itself
he
held
that
as
barbarous
in
form
and
false
in
feeling
it
did
little
honour
to
the
british
theatre
he
despised
many
of
the
speeches
pitied
miriam
for
having
to
utter
them
and
considered
that
lighted
by
that
sort
of
candle
the
path
of
fame
might
very
well
lead
nowhere
when
the
ordeal
was
over
he
went
behind
again
where
in
the
satin
of
the
silly
issue
the
heroine
of
the
occasion
said
to
him
fancy
my
having
to
drag
through
that
other
stuff
the
brutes
he
was
vague
about
the
persons
designated
in
this
allusion
but
he
let
it
pass
he
had
at
the
moment
a
kind
of
detached
foreboding
of
the
way
any
gentleman
familiarly
connected
with
her
in
the
future
would
probably
form
the
habit
of
letting
objurgations
and
some
other
things
pass
this
had
become
indeed
now
a
frequent
state
of
mind
with
him
the
instant
he
was
before
her
near
her
next
her
he
found
himself
a
helpless
subject
of
the
spell
which
so
far
at
least
as
he
was
concerned
she
put
forth
by
contact
and
of
which
the
potency
was
punctual
and
absolute
the
fit
came
on
as
he
said
exactly
as
some
esteemed
on
a
great
line
bangs
at
a
given
moment
into
the
station
at
a
distance
he
partly
recovered
himself
that
was
the
encouragement
for
going
to
the
shaky
republic
but
as
soon
as
he
entered
her
presence
his
life
struck
him
as
a
thing
disconnected
from
his
will
it
was
as
if
he
himself
had
been
one
thing
and
his
behaviour
another
he
had
shining
views
of
this
difference
drawn
as
they
might
be
from
the
coming
years
little
illustrative
scenes
in
which
he
saw
himself
in
strange
attitudes
of
resignation
always
rather
sad
and
still
and
with
a
slightly
bent
head
such
images
should
not
have
been
inspiring
but
it
is
a
fact
that
they
were
something
to
go
upon
the
gentleman
with
the
bent
head
had
evidently
given
up
something
that
was
dear
to
him
but
it
was
exactly
because
he
had
got
his
price
that
he
was
there
come
and
see
me
three
or
four
hours
hence
miriam
said
come
that
is
about
six
i
shall
rest
till
then
but
i
want
particularly
to
talk
with
you
there
will
be
no
one
else
not
the
tip
of
any
tiresome
nose
you
do
me
good
so
of
course
he
drove
up
at
six
xli
i
do
know
i
have
the
least
idea
i
do
care
do
ask
me
it
was
so
he
met
some
immediate
appeal
of
her
artistic
egotism
some
challenge
of
his
impression
of
her
at
this
and
that
moment
she
frankly
better
give
up
such
and
such
a
point
and
return
to
their
first
idea
the
one
they
had
talked
over
so
much
peter
replied
to
this
that
he
disowned
all
ideas
that
at
any
rate
he
should
never
have
another
as
long
as
he
lived
and
that
so
help
him
heaven
they
had
worried
that
hard
bone
more
than
enough
you
tired
of
me
yes
already
she
said
sadly
and
kindly
they
were
alone
her
mother
had
not
peeped
out
and
she
had
prepared
herself
to
return
to
the
strand
however
it
does
matter
and
of
course
your
head
full
of
other
things
you
must
think
me
ravenously
selfish
perpetually
chattering
about
my
vulgar
shop
what
will
you
have
when
one
a
vulgar
you
used
to
like
it
but
then
you
an
ambassador
what
do
you
know
about
my
being
a
minister
he
asked
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
showing
sombre
eyes
sometimes
he
held
her
handsomer
on
the
stage
than
off
and
sometimes
he
reversed
that
judgement
the
former
of
these
convictions
had
held
his
mind
in
the
morning
and
it
was
now
punctually
followed
by
the
other
as
soon
as
she
stepped
on
the
boards
a
great
and
special
alteration
usually
took
place
in
her
she
was
in
focus
and
in
her
frame
yet
there
were
hours
too
in
which
she
wore
her
world
face
before
the
audience
just
as
there
were
hours
when
she
wore
her
stage
face
in
the
world
she
took
up
either
mask
as
it
suited
her
humour
he
was
seeing
each
in
its
order
and
feeling
each
the
best
i
should
know
very
little
if
i
waited
for
you
to
tell
me
very
certain
miriam
returned
it
in
the
papers
that
you
got
a
high
appointment
but
i
do
read
the
papers
unless
there
something
in
them
about
myself
next
week
i
shall
devour
them
and
think
them
no
doubt
inane
it
was
basil
told
me
this
afternoon
of
your
promotion
he
had
seen
it
announced
somewhere
i
delighted
if
it
gives
you
more
money
and
more
advantages
but
do
expect
me
to
be
glad
that
going
away
to
some
distant
disgusting
country
the
matter
has
only
just
been
settled
and
we
each
been
busy
with
our
own
affairs
but
even
if
you
had
given
me
these
opportunities
peter
went
on
i
should
have
tried
to
see
you
to
tell
you
my
news
and
take
leave
of
you
take
leave
are
you
coming
oh
yes
i
shall
see
you
through
that
but
i
shall
rush
away
the
very
moment
it
over
i
shall
be
much
better
then
really
i
shall
the
girl
said
the
better
you
are
the
worse
you
are
she
returned
his
frown
with
a
beautiful
charity
if
it
would
do
you
any
good
i
be
bad
the
worse
you
are
the
better
you
are
peter
laughed
you
a
devouring
demon
not
a
bit
it
you
it
i
i
like
that
it
you
who
make
trouble
who
are
sore
and
suspicious
and
supersubtle
not
taking
things
as
they
come
and
for
what
they
are
but
twisting
them
into
misery
and
falsity
oh
i
watched
you
enough
my
dear
friend
and
i
been
sorry
for
you
and
sorry
as
well
for
myself
for
i
not
so
taken
up
with
myself
in
the
low
greedy
sense
as
you
think
i
not
such
a
base
creature
i
capable
of
gratitude
i
capable
of
affection
one
may
live
in
paint
and
tinsel
but
one
is
absolutely
without
a
soul
yes
i
got
one
the
girl
went
on
though
i
do
smear
my
face
and
grin
at
myself
in
the
glass
and
practise
my
intonations
if
what
you
going
to
do
is
good
for
you
i
very
glad
if
it
leads
to
good
things
to
honour
and
fortune
and
greatness
i
enchanted
if
it
means
your
being
away
always
for
ever
and
ever
of
course
serious
you
know
it
i
need
tell
you
i
regard
you
as
i
really
regard
any
one
else
i
a
confidence
in
you
ah
it
a
luxury
a
gentleman
ah
you
a
gentleman
it
just
that
and
then
you
see
you
understand
and
that
a
luxury
too
you
a
luxury
altogether
dear
clever
sherringham
your
being
where
i
shall
never
see
you
is
a
thing
i
shall
enjoy
i
know
that
from
the
separation
of
these
last
months
after
our
beautiful
life
in
paris
the
best
thing
that
ever
happened
to
me
or
that
ever
will
but
if
it
your
career
if
it
your
happiness
well
i
can
miss
you
and
hold
my
tongue
i
be
disinterested
i
can
what
did
you
want
me
to
come
for
he
asked
all
attentive
and
motionless
the
same
impression
the
old
impression
was
with
him
again
the
sense
that
if
she
was
sincere
it
was
sincerity
of
execution
if
she
was
genuine
it
was
the
genuineness
of
doing
it
well
she
did
it
so
well
now
that
this
very
fact
was
charming
and
touching
in
claiming
from
him
at
the
theatre
this
hour
of
the
afternoon
she
had
wanted
honestly
the
more
as
she
had
not
seen
him
at
home
for
several
days
to
go
over
with
him
once
again
on
the
eve
of
the
great
night
it
would
be
for
her
second
creation
the
critics
would
lie
so
in
wait
the
first
success
might
have
been
a
fluke
some
of
her
recurrent
doubts
knowing
from
experience
of
what
good
counsel
he
often
was
how
he
could
give
a
worrying
question
its
settler
at
the
last
then
she
had
heard
from
dashwood
of
the
change
in
his
situation
and
that
had
really
from
one
moment
to
the
other
made
her
think
sympathetically
of
his
preoccupations
led
her
to
drop
her
own
she
was
sorry
to
lose
him
and
eager
to
let
him
know
how
good
a
friend
she
was
conscious
he
had
been
to
her
but
the
expression
of
this
was
already
at
the
end
of
a
minute
a
strange
bedevilment
she
began
to
listen
to
herself
to
speak
dramatically
to
represent
she
uttered
the
things
she
felt
as
if
they
were
snatches
of
old
and
really
felt
them
the
more
because
they
sounded
so
well
this
however
did
prevent
their
really
being
as
good
feelings
as
those
of
anybody
else
and
at
the
moment
her
friend
to
still
a
rising
emotion
which
he
knew
he
still
articulated
the
challenge
i
have
just
recorded
she
had
for
his
sensibility
at
any
rate
the
truth
of
gentleness
and
generosity
there
something
the
matter
with
you
my
dear
you
jealous
miriam
said
you
jealous
of
poor
dormer
that
an
example
of
the
way
you
tangle
everything
up
lord
he
wo
hurt
you
nor
me
either
he
ca
hurt
me
certainly
peter
returned
and
neither
can
you
for
i
a
nice
little
heart
of
stone
and
a
smart
new
breastplate
of
iron
the
interest
i
take
in
you
is
something
quite
extraordinary
but
the
most
extraordinary
thing
in
it
is
that
it
perfectly
prepared
to
tolerate
the
interest
of
others
the
interest
of
others
need
trouble
it
much
miriam
declared
if
dormer
has
broken
off
his
marriage
to
such
an
awfully
fine
woman
for
she
that
your
swell
of
a
sister
it
is
for
a
ranting
wretch
like
me
he
kind
to
me
because
that
his
nature
and
he
notices
me
because
that
his
business
but
he
away
up
in
the
clouds
a
thousand
miles
over
my
head
he
has
got
something
as
they
say
he
in
love
with
an
idea
i
think
it
a
shocking
bad
one
but
his
own
affair
he
quite
living
on
nectar
and
ambrosia
what
he
has
to
spare
for
us
poor
crawling
things
on
earth
is
only
a
few
dry
crumbs
i
did
even
ask
him
to
come
to
rehearsal
besides
he
thinks
you
in
love
with
me
and
that
it
would
be
honourable
to
cut
in
he
capable
of
that
is
it
charming
if
he
were
to
relent
and
give
up
his
scruples
would
you
marry
him
peter
asked
mercy
how
you
chatter
about
the
girl
laughed
la
maladie
you
all
got
it
on
the
brain
why
i
put
it
that
way
to
please
you
he
explained
you
complained
to
me
last
year
precisely
that
this
was
not
what
seemed
generally
wanted
oh
last
year
she
made
nothing
of
that
then
differently
yes
very
tiresome
she
conceded
you
told
me
moreover
in
paris
more
than
once
that
you
would
listen
to
anything
but
that
well
she
declared
i
wo
but
i
shall
wait
till
i
find
a
husband
who
charming
enough
and
bad
enough
one
who
beat
me
and
swindle
me
and
spend
my
money
on
other
women
that
the
sort
of
man
for
me
dormer
delightful
as
he
is
does
come
up
to
that
you
marry
basil
dashwood
he
spoke
it
with
conviction
oh
call
it
marry
if
you
like
that
what
poor
mother
threatens
me
with
she
lives
in
dread
of
it
to
this
hour
he
mentioned
i
have
managed
to
make
out
what
your
mother
wants
she
has
so
many
ideas
as
madame
carré
said
she
wants
me
to
be
some
sort
of
tremendous
creature
all
her
ideas
are
reducible
to
that
what
makes
the
muddle
is
that
she
is
clear
about
the
creature
she
wants
most
a
great
actress
or
a
great
lady
sometimes
she
inclines
for
one
and
sometimes
for
the
other
but
on
the
whole
persuading
herself
that
a
great
actress
if
she
cultivate
the
right
people
may
a
great
lady
when
i
tell
her
that
wo
do
and
that
a
great
actress
can
never
be
anything
but
a
great
vagabond
then
the
dear
old
thing
has
tantrums
and
we
have
scenes
the
most
grotesque
make
the
fortune
for
a
subject
of
some
rascal
if
he
had
the
wit
to
guess
them
which
luckily
for
us
perhaps
he
never
will
she
usually
winds
up
by
protesting
un
peu
miriam
added
and
as
her
companion
professed
his
complete
inability
to
divine
by
declaring
that
rather
than
take
it
that
way
i
must
marry
she
shrewder
than
i
thought
peter
returned
it
the
last
of
vanities
to
talk
about
but
i
may
state
in
passing
that
if
you
marry
me
you
should
be
the
greatest
of
all
possible
ladies
she
had
a
beautiful
comical
gape
lord
o
mercy
my
dear
fellow
what
natural
capacity
have
i
for
that
you
artist
enough
for
anything
i
shall
be
a
great
diplomatist
my
resolution
firmly
taken
i
infinitely
cleverer
than
you
have
the
least
idea
of
and
you
shall
be
he
went
on
a
great
wife
and
the
demon
the
devil
the
devourer
and
destroyer
that
you
are
so
fond
of
talking
about
what
in
such
a
position
do
you
do
with
that
element
of
my
nature
le
she
cried
as
with
a
real
anxiety
i
look
after
it
i
keep
it
under
rather
perhaps
i
should
say
i
bribe
it
and
amuse
it
i
gorge
it
with
earthly
grandeurs
that
better
said
miriam
for
a
demon
that
kept
under
is
a
shabby
little
demon
do
let
be
shabby
then
she
added
do
you
really
go
away
the
beginning
of
next
week
monday
night
if
possible
ah
that
but
to
paris
before
you
go
to
your
new
post
they
must
give
you
an
interval
here
i
sha
take
it
i
so
tremendously
keen
for
my
duties
i
shall
insist
on
going
sooner
oh
he
went
on
i
shall
be
concentrated
now
i
come
and
act
there
she
met
it
all
she
was
amused
and
amusing
i
already
forgotten
what
it
was
i
wanted
to
discuss
with
you
she
said
it
was
some
trumpery
stuff
what
i
want
to
say
now
is
only
one
thing
that
it
not
in
the
least
true
that
because
my
life
pitches
me
in
every
direction
and
mixes
me
up
with
all
sorts
of
people
or
rather
with
one
sort
mainly
poor
dears
i
have
a
decent
character
i
have
common
honesty
your
sympathy
your
generosity
your
patience
your
precious
suggestions
our
dear
sweet
days
last
summer
in
paris
i
shall
never
forget
you
the
best
you
different
from
all
the
others
think
of
me
as
you
please
and
make
profane
jokes
about
my
mating
with
a
disguised
i
shall
think
of
only
in
one
way
i
a
great
respect
for
you
with
all
my
heart
i
hope
you
be
a
great
diplomatist
god
bless
you
dear
clever
man
she
got
up
as
she
spoke
and
in
so
doing
glanced
at
the
clock
a
movement
that
somehow
only
added
to
the
noble
gravity
of
her
discourse
she
was
considering
his
time
so
much
more
than
her
own
sherringham
at
this
rising
too
took
out
his
watch
and
stood
a
moment
with
his
eyes
bent
upon
it
though
without
in
the
least
seeing
what
the
needles
marked
you
have
to
go
to
reach
the
theatre
at
your
usual
hour
wo
you
let
me
not
keep
you
that
is
let
me
keep
you
only
long
enough
just
to
say
this
once
for
all
as
i
shall
never
speak
of
it
again
i
going
away
to
save
myself
he
frankly
said
planted
before
her
and
seeking
her
eyes
with
his
own
i
ought
to
go
no
doubt
in
silence
in
decorum
in
virtuous
submission
to
hard
necessity
without
asking
for
credit
or
sympathy
without
provoking
any
sort
of
scene
or
calling
attention
to
my
fortitude
but
i
ca
upon
my
soul
i
ca
i
can
go
i
can
see
it
through
but
i
ca
hold
my
tongue
i
want
you
to
know
all
about
it
so
that
over
there
when
i
bored
to
death
i
shall
at
least
have
the
exasperatingly
vain
consolation
of
feeling
that
you
do
know
and
that
it
does
neither
you
nor
me
any
good
he
paused
a
moment
on
which
as
quite
vague
she
appealed
that
i
know
what
that
i
a
consuming
passion
for
you
and
that
it
impossible
oh
impossible
my
friend
she
sighed
but
with
a
quickness
in
her
assent
very
good
it
interferes
the
gratification
of
it
would
interfere
fatally
with
the
ambition
of
each
of
us
our
ambitions
are
inferior
and
odious
but
we
tied
fast
to
them
ah
why
ai
we
simple
she
quavered
as
if
all
touched
by
it
why
ai
we
of
the
people
tout
le
just
a
man
and
a
girl
liking
each
other
he
waited
a
little
she
was
so
tenderly
mocking
so
sweetly
ambiguous
because
we
precious
asses
however
i
simple
enough
after
all
to
care
for
you
as
i
never
cared
for
any
human
creature
you
have
as
it
happens
a
personal
charm
for
me
that
no
one
has
ever
approached
and
from
the
top
of
your
splendid
head
to
the
sole
of
your
theatrical
shoe
i
could
go
down
on
my
face
there
abjectly
and
kiss
it
every
inch
of
you
is
dear
and
delightful
to
me
therefore
she
took
this
in
with
wider
eyes
he
had
put
the
matter
in
a
way
that
struck
her
for
a
moment
all
the
same
he
was
afraid
she
would
reply
as
on
the
confessed
experience
of
so
many
such
tributes
handsome
as
this
one
was
but
she
was
too
much
moved
the
pure
colour
that
had
risen
to
her
face
showed
it
to
have
recourse
to
this
particular
facility
she
was
moved
even
to
the
glimmer
of
tears
though
she
gave
him
her
hand
with
a
smile
i
so
glad
you
said
all
that
for
from
you
i
know
what
it
means
certainly
it
better
for
you
to
go
away
of
course
all
wrong
is
it
but
that
the
only
thing
it
can
be
therefore
it
all
right
is
it
some
day
when
we
both
great
people
talk
these
things
over
then
we
shall
be
quiet
we
shall
be
rich
we
shall
be
at
peace
let
us
hope
so
at
least
and
better
friends
than
others
about
us
will
know
she
paused
smiling
still
and
then
said
while
he
held
her
hand
do
come
night
with
this
she
attempted
to
draw
her
hand
away
as
if
everything
were
settled
and
over
but
the
effect
of
her
movement
was
that
as
he
held
her
tight
he
was
simply
drawn
toward
her
and
close
to
her
the
effect
of
this
in
turn
was
that
releasing
her
only
to
possess
her
the
more
completely
he
seized
her
in
his
arms
and
breathing
deeply
i
love
you
you
know
clasped
her
in
a
long
embrace
his
demonstration
and
her
conscious
sufferance
almost
equally
liberal
so
sustained
themselves
that
the
door
of
the
room
had
time
to
open
slowly
before
either
had
taken
notice
rooth
who
had
not
peeped
in
before
peeped
in
now
becoming
in
this
manner
witness
of
an
incident
she
could
scarce
have
counted
on
the
unexpected
indeed
had
for
rooth
never
been
an
insuperable
element
in
things
it
was
her
position
in
general
to
be
too
acquainted
with
all
the
passions
for
any
crude
surprise
as
the
others
turned
round
they
saw
her
stand
there
and
smile
and
heard
her
ejaculate
with
wise
indulgence
oh
you
extravagant
children
miriam
brushed
off
her
tears
quickly
but
unconfusedly
he
going
away
the
wretch
he
bidding
us
farewell
peter
it
was
perhaps
a
result
of
his
acute
agitation
laughed
out
at
the
us
he
had
already
laughed
at
the
charge
of
puerility
and
rooth
went
on
going
away
ah
then
i
must
have
one
too
she
held
out
both
her
hands
and
sherringham
stepping
forward
to
take
them
kissed
her
respectfully
on
each
cheek
in
the
foreign
manner
while
she
continued
our
dear
old
friend
our
kind
gallant
gentleman
the
gallant
gentleman
has
been
promoted
to
a
great
post
the
proper
reward
of
his
gallantry
miriam
said
he
going
out
as
minister
to
some
impossible
place
where
is
it
as
minister
how
very
charming
we
getting
on
and
their
companion
languished
up
at
him
with
a
world
of
approval
oh
well
enough
one
must
take
what
one
can
get
he
answered
you
get
everything
now
i
sure
sha
you
rooth
asked
with
an
inflexion
that
called
back
to
him
comically
the
source
of
the
sound
was
so
different
the
very
vibrations
he
had
heard
the
day
before
from
lady
agnes
he
going
to
glory
and
he
forget
all
about
us
forget
he
has
ever
known
such
low
people
so
we
shall
never
see
him
again
and
it
better
so
miriam
repeated
the
brougham
must
be
there
but
i
wo
take
you
i
want
to
talk
to
mother
about
you
and
we
shall
say
things
not
fit
for
you
to
hear
oh
i
let
you
know
what
we
lose
do
be
afraid
she
added
to
rooth
he
the
rising
star
of
diplomacy
i
knew
it
from
the
first
i
know
how
things
turn
out
for
such
people
as
you
cried
the
old
woman
gazing
fondly
at
sherringham
but
you
mean
to
say
you
not
coming
night
do
do
it
great
folly
miriam
interposed
and
it
quite
needless
since
you
saw
me
peter
turned
from
the
mother
to
the
daughter
the
former
of
whom
broke
out
to
the
latter
oh
you
dear
rogue
to
say
one
has
you
yet
you
know
how
you
come
up
to
it
you
be
beyond
everything
yes
i
shall
be
there
certainly
peter
said
at
the
door
to
rooth
oh
you
dreadful
goose
miriam
called
after
him
but
he
went
out
without
looking
round
at
her
book
seventh
xlii
nick
dormer
had
for
the
hour
quite
taken
up
his
abode
at
his
studio
where
biddy
usually
arrived
after
breakfast
to
give
him
news
of
the
state
of
affairs
in
calcutta
gardens
and
where
many
letters
and
telegrams
were
now
addressed
him
among
such
missives
on
the
morning
of
the
saturday
on
which
peter
sherringham
had
promised
to
dine
at
the
other
house
was
a
note
from
miriam
rooth
informing
nick
that
if
he
should
telegraph
to
put
her
off
she
would
turn
up
about
eleven
probably
with
her
mother
for
just
one
more
sitting
she
added
that
it
was
a
nervous
day
for
her
and
that
she
could
keep
still
so
that
it
would
really
be
very
kind
to
let
her
come
to
him
as
a
refuge
she
wished
to
stay
away
from
the
theatre
where
everything
was
now
settled
or
so
much
the
worse
for
the
others
if
it
was
till
the
evening
in
spite
of
which
she
should
if
left
to
herself
be
sure
to
go
there
it
would
keep
her
quiet
and
soothe
her
to
sit
he
could
keep
her
quiet
he
was
such
a
blessing
that
way
at
any
time
therefore
she
would
give
him
two
or
three
hours
or
rather
she
would
herself
ask
for
them
if
he
did
positively
turn
her
from
the
door
it
had
not
been
definite
to
nick
that
he
wanted
another
sitting
at
all
for
the
slight
work
as
he
held
it
to
be
that
miriam
had
already
helped
him
to
achieve
he
regarded
this
work
as
a
mere
light
of
the
shaken
tree
he
had
made
what
he
could
of
it
and
would
have
been
embarrassed
to
make
more
if
it
was
not
finished
this
was
because
it
was
not
finishable
at
any
rate
he
had
said
all
he
had
to
say
in
that
particular
phrase
the
young
man
in
truth
was
not
just
now
in
the
highest
spirits
his
imagination
had
within
two
or
three
days
become
conscious
of
a
check
that
he
tried
to
explain
by
the
idea
of
a
natural
reaction
any
decision
or
violent
turn
any
need
of
a
new
sharp
choice
in
one
career
was
upsetting
and
exaggerate
that
importance
and
one
own
as
little
as
one
would
a
deal
of
flurry
could
help
attending
especially
in
the
face
of
so
much
scandal
the
horrid
act
odious
to
one
modesty
at
the
best
of
changing
one
clothes
in
the
marketplace
that
made
life
not
at
all
positively
pleasant
yet
decidedly
thrilling
for
the
hour
and
it
was
well
enough
till
the
thrill
abated
when
this
occurred
as
it
inevitably
would
the
romance
and
the
glow
of
the
adventure
were
exchanged
for
the
chill
and
the
prose
it
was
to
these
latter
elements
he
had
waked
up
pretty
wide
on
this
particular
morning
and
the
prospect
was
not
appreciably
fresher
from
the
fact
that
he
had
warned
himself
in
advance
it
would
be
dull
he
had
in
fact
known
how
dull
it
would
be
but
now
he
would
have
time
to
learn
even
better
a
reaction
was
a
reaction
but
it
was
not
after
all
a
catastrophe
it
would
be
a
feature
of
his
very
freedom
that
he
should
ask
himself
if
he
had
made
a
great
mistake
this
privilege
would
doubtless
even
remain
within
the
limits
of
its
nature
in
exposing
him
to
hours
of
intimate
conviction
of
his
madness
but
he
would
live
to
retract
his
retractations
this
was
the
first
thing
to
bear
in
mind
he
was
absorbed
even
while
he
dressed
in
the
effort
to
achieve
intelligibly
to
himself
some
such
revolution
when
by
the
first
post
miriam
note
arrived
at
first
it
did
little
to
help
his
agility
it
made
him
seeing
her
esthetic
faith
as
so
much
stronger
and
simpler
than
his
own
wonder
how
he
should
keep
with
her
at
her
high
level
ambition
in
her
was
always
on
the
rush
and
she
was
not
a
person
to
conceive
that
others
might
in
bad
moments
listen
for
the
trumpet
in
vain
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
her
that
only
the
day
before
he
had
spent
a
part
of
the
afternoon
quite
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
he
had
in
fact
turned
into
the
national
gallery
and
had
wandered
about
there
for
more
than
an
hour
and
it
was
just
while
he
did
so
that
the
immitigable
recoil
had
begun
perversely
to
make
itself
felt
the
perversity
was
all
the
greater
from
the
fact
that
if
the
experience
was
depressing
this
was
not
because
he
had
been
discouraged
beyond
measure
by
the
sight
of
the
grand
things
that
had
been
done
things
so
much
grander
than
any
that
would
ever
bear
his
signature
that
variation
he
was
duly
acquainted
with
and
should
know
in
abundance
again
what
had
happened
to
him
as
he
passed
on
this
occasion
from
titian
to
rubens
and
from
gainsborough
to
rembrandt
was
that
he
found
himself
calling
the
whole
exhibited
art
into
question
what
was
it
after
all
at
the
best
and
why
had
people
given
it
so
high
a
place
its
weakness
its
limits
broke
upon
him
tacitly
blaspheming
he
looked
with
a
lustreless
eye
at
the
palpable
polished
toned
objects
designed
for
suspension
on
hooks
that
is
he
blasphemed
if
it
were
blasphemy
to
feel
that
as
bearing
on
the
energies
of
man
they
were
a
poor
and
secondary
show
the
human
force
producing
them
was
so
far
from
one
of
the
greatest
their
place
was
a
small
place
and
their
connexion
with
the
heroic
life
casual
and
slight
they
represented
so
little
great
ideas
and
it
was
great
ideas
that
kept
the
world
from
chaos
he
had
incontestably
been
in
much
closer
relation
with
them
a
few
months
before
than
he
was
it
made
up
a
great
deal
for
what
was
false
and
hollow
what
was
merely
personal
in
politics
that
were
the
idea
greater
or
smaller
they
could
at
their
best
so
directly
deal
with
it
the
love
of
it
had
really
been
much
of
the
time
at
the
bottom
of
his
impulse
to
follow
them
up
though
this
was
not
what
he
had
most
talked
of
with
his
political
friends
or
even
with
julia
no
political
as
julia
was
he
had
not
conferred
with
her
much
about
the
idea
however
this
might
have
been
his
own
fault
quite
as
much
as
hers
and
she
in
fact
took
such
things
such
enthusiasms
for
granted
there
was
an
immense
deal
in
every
way
that
she
took
for
granted
on
the
other
hand
he
had
often
put
forward
this
brighter
side
of
the
care
for
the
public
weal
in
his
discussions
with
gabriel
nash
to
the
end
it
is
true
of
making
that
worthy
scoff
aloud
at
what
he
was
pleased
to
term
his
hypocrisy
gabriel
maintained
precisely
that
there
were
more
ideas
more
of
those
that
man
lived
by
in
a
single
room
of
the
national
gallery
than
in
all
the
statutes
of
parliament
nick
had
replied
to
this
more
than
once
that
the
determination
of
what
man
did
live
by
was
required
to
which
nash
had
retorted
and
it
was
very
rarely
that
he
quoted
scripture
that
it
was
at
any
rate
not
by
bread
and
beans
alone
the
statutes
of
parliament
gave
him
bread
and
beans
au
nick
had
at
present
no
pretension
of
trying
this
question
over
again
he
reminded
himself
that
his
ambiguity
was
subjective
as
the
philosophers
said
the
result
of
a
mood
which
in
due
course
would
be
at
the
mercy
of
another
mood
it
made
him
curse
and
cursing
as
a
finality
lacked
firmness
one
had
to
drive
in
posts
somewhere
under
the
greatest
time
to
do
one
work
was
when
it
did
seem
worth
doing
for
then
one
gave
it
a
brilliant
chance
that
of
resisting
the
stiffest
test
of
all
the
test
of
striking
one
as
too
bad
to
do
the
most
when
there
would
be
the
least
to
be
got
by
it
was
to
be
most
in
the
spirit
of
high
production
one
thing
at
any
rate
was
certain
nick
reflected
nothing
on
earth
would
induce
him
to
change
back
again
not
even
if
this
twilight
of
the
soul
should
last
for
the
rest
of
his
days
he
hardened
himself
in
his
posture
with
a
good
conscience
which
had
they
had
a
glimpse
of
it
would
have
made
him
still
more
diverting
to
those
who
already
thought
him
so
and
now
by
a
happy
chance
miriam
suddenly
supplied
the
bridge
correcting
the
gap
in
his
continuity
if
he
had
made
his
sketch
it
was
a
proof
he
had
done
her
and
that
he
had
done
her
flashed
upon
him
as
a
sign
that
she
would
be
still
more
feasible
art
was
it
came
back
to
that
which
politics
in
most
cases
were
he
thus
to
pursue
our
image
planted
his
supports
in
the
dimness
beneath
all
cursing
and
on
the
platform
so
improvised
was
able
in
his
relief
to
dance
he
sent
out
a
telegram
to
balaklava
place
requesting
his
beautiful
sitter
by
no
manner
of
means
to
fail
him
when
his
servant
came
back
it
was
to
usher
into
the
studio
peter
sherringham
whom
the
man
had
apparently
found
at
the
door
the
hour
was
so
early
for
general
commerce
that
nick
immediately
guessed
his
visitor
had
come
on
some
rare
errand
but
this
inference
yielded
to
the
reflexion
that
peter
might
after
all
only
wish
to
make
up
by
present
zeal
for
not
having
been
near
him
before
he
forgot
that
as
he
had
subsequently
learned
from
biddy
their
foreign
or
all
but
foreign
cousin
had
spent
an
hour
in
rosedale
road
missing
him
there
but
pulling
out
miriam
portrait
the
day
of
his
own
last
visit
to
beauclere
these
young
men
were
not
on
a
ceremonious
footing
and
it
was
not
in
nature
to
keep
a
record
of
civilities
rendered
or
omitted
nevertheless
he
had
been
vaguely
conscious
that
during
a
stay
in
london
elastic
enough
on
peter
part
he
and
his
kinsman
had
foregathered
less
than
of
yore
it
was
indeed
an
absorbing
moment
in
the
career
of
each
but
even
while
recognising
such
a
truth
nick
judged
it
not
impossible
that
julia
brother
might
have
taken
upon
himself
to
resent
some
suppositions
failure
of
consideration
for
that
lady
though
this
indeed
would
have
been
stupid
and
the
newly
appointed
minister
to
he
had
forgotten
where
did
often
make
mistakes
nick
held
that
as
he
had
treated
julia
with
studious
generosity
she
had
nothing
whatever
to
visit
on
him
wherefore
peter
had
still
less
it
was
at
any
rate
none
of
that
gentleman
business
there
were
only
two
abatements
to
disposing
in
a
few
frank
words
of
all
this
one
of
them
nick
general
hatred
of
talking
of
his
private
affairs
a
reluctance
in
which
he
and
peter
were
well
matched
and
the
other
a
truth
involving
more
of
a
confession
the
subtle
truth
that
the
most
definite
and
even
most
soothing
result
of
the
collapse
of
his
engagement
was
as
happened
an
unprecedented
consciousness
of
freedom
nick
observation
was
of
a
different
sort
from
his
cousin
he
noted
much
less
the
signs
of
the
hour
and
kept
throughout
a
looser
register
of
life
nevertheless
just
as
one
of
our
young
men
had
during
these
days
in
london
found
the
air
peopled
with
personal
influences
the
concussion
of
human
atoms
so
the
other
though
only
asking
to
live
without
too
many
questions
and
work
without
too
many
rubs
to
be
glad
and
sorry
in
short
on
easy
terms
had
become
aware
of
a
certain
social
tightness
of
the
fact
that
life
is
crowded
and
passion
restless
accident
and
community
inevitable
everybody
with
whom
one
had
relations
had
other
relations
too
and
even
indifference
was
a
mixture
and
detachment
a
compromise
the
only
wisdom
was
to
consent
to
the
loss
if
necessary
of
everything
but
one
temper
and
to
the
ruin
if
necessary
of
everything
but
one
work
it
must
be
added
that
relative
took
precautions
against
irritation
perhaps
in
excess
of
the
danger
as
departing
travellers
about
to
whiz
through
foreign
countries
mouth
in
combinations
of
words
they
will
never
use
he
was
at
home
in
clear
air
and
disliked
to
struggle
either
for
breath
or
for
light
he
had
a
dim
sense
that
peter
felt
some
discomfort
from
him
and
might
have
come
now
to
tell
him
so
in
which
case
he
should
be
sorry
for
the
sufferer
in
various
ways
but
as
soon
as
that
aspirant
began
to
speak
suspicion
reverted
to
mere
ancient
kindness
and
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
his
speech
had
a
slightly
exaggerated
promptitude
like
the
promptitude
of
business
which
might
have
denoted
to
nick
it
quickly
appeared
better
to
be
glad
than
to
be
sorry
this
simple
argument
was
more
than
sufficient
to
make
him
glad
peter
was
there
my
dear
fellow
it
an
unpardonable
hour
is
it
i
was
even
sure
you
be
up
yet
had
to
risk
it
because
my
hours
are
numbered
going
away
peter
went
on
i
a
thousand
things
to
do
i
had
no
talk
with
you
this
time
such
as
we
used
to
have
of
old
an
irreparable
loss
but
it
your
fault
you
know
and
as
i
got
to
rush
about
all
day
i
thought
i
just
catch
you
before
any
one
else
does
some
one
has
already
caught
me
but
there
plenty
of
time
nick
returned
peter
all
but
asked
a
question
it
fell
short
i
see
i
see
i
sorry
to
say
i
only
a
few
minutes
at
best
man
of
crushing
responsibilities
you
come
to
humiliate
me
his
companion
cried
i
know
all
about
it
it
more
than
i
do
then
that
not
what
i
come
for
but
i
shall
be
delighted
if
i
humiliate
you
a
little
by
the
way
i
two
things
in
mind
and
i
mention
the
most
difficult
first
i
came
here
the
other
day
the
day
after
my
arrival
in
town
ah
yes
so
you
did
it
was
very
good
of
you
nick
remembered
i
ought
to
have
returned
your
visit
or
left
a
card
or
written
my
name
to
have
done
something
in
great
stanhope
street
ought
i
you
had
got
this
new
thing
then
or
i
have
peter
eyed
him
a
moment
i
say
what
the
matter
with
you
am
i
really
unforgivable
for
having
taken
that
liberty
what
liberty
nick
looked
now
quite
innocent
of
care
and
indeed
his
visitor
allusion
was
not
promptly
clear
he
was
thinking
for
the
instant
all
of
biddy
of
whom
and
whose
secret
inclinations
grace
had
insisted
on
talking
to
him
they
were
none
of
his
business
and
if
he
would
for
the
world
have
let
the
girl
herself
suspect
he
had
violent
lights
on
what
was
most
screened
and
curtained
in
her
much
less
would
he
have
made
peter
a
clumsy
present
of
this
knowledge
grace
had
a
queer
theory
that
peter
treated
biddy
badly
treated
them
all
somehow
badly
but
grace
zeal
she
had
plenty
of
it
though
she
affected
all
sorts
of
fine
indifference
almost
always
took
the
form
of
her
being
unusually
wrong
nick
wanted
to
do
only
what
biddy
would
thank
him
for
and
he
knew
very
well
what
she
would
she
wished
him
and
peter
to
be
great
friends
and
the
only
obstacle
to
this
was
that
peter
was
too
much
of
a
diplomatist
peter
made
him
for
an
instant
think
of
her
and
of
the
hour
they
had
lately
spent
together
in
the
studio
in
his
absence
an
hour
of
which
biddy
had
given
him
a
history
full
of
items
and
omissions
and
this
in
turn
brought
nick
imagination
back
to
his
visitor
own
side
of
the
matter
that
general
human
complexity
of
which
the
sense
had
lately
increased
with
him
and
to
which
it
was
owing
that
any
thread
one
might
take
hold
of
would
probably
be
the
extremely
wrong
end
of
something
was
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
while
poor
biddy
was
thinking
of
peter
it
was
ten
to
one
poor
peter
was
thinking
of
miriam
rooth
all
of
which
danced
before
nick
intellectual
vision
for
a
space
briefer
than
my
too
numerous
words
i
pitched
into
your
treasures
i
rummaged
among
your
canvases
peter
said
biddy
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
she
maintained
an
attitude
of
irreproachable
reserve
it
has
been
on
my
conscience
all
these
days
and
i
ought
to
have
done
penance
before
i
been
putting
it
off
partly
because
i
so
ashamed
of
my
indiscretion
my
dear
chap
my
provocation
was
great
i
heard
you
had
been
painting
miss
rooth
so
that
i
could
restrain
my
curiosity
i
simply
went
into
that
corner
and
struck
out
there
a
trifle
wildly
no
doubt
i
dragged
the
young
lady
to
the
light
your
sister
turned
pale
as
she
saw
me
it
was
a
good
deal
like
breaking
open
one
of
your
letters
was
it
however
i
assure
you
it
all
right
for
i
congratulate
you
both
on
your
style
and
on
your
correspondent
you
as
clever
as
witty
as
humorous
as
ever
old
boy
nick
pronounced
going
himself
into
the
corner
designated
by
his
companion
and
laying
his
hands
on
the
same
canvas
your
curiosity
the
highest
possible
tribute
to
my
little
attempt
and
your
sympathy
sets
me
right
with
myself
there
she
is
again
nick
went
on
thrusting
the
picture
into
an
empty
frame
you
shall
see
her
whether
you
wish
to
or
not
right
with
yourself
you
do
mean
to
say
you
been
wrong
peter
returned
standing
opposite
the
portrait
oh
i
do
know
i
been
kicking
up
such
a
row
anything
better
than
a
row
she
awfully
good
she
awfully
true
said
peter
you
done
more
to
her
since
the
other
day
you
put
in
several
things
yes
but
i
worked
distractedly
i
not
altogether
conformed
to
the
good
rule
about
being
off
with
the
old
love
with
the
old
love
and
the
visitor
looked
hard
at
the
picture
before
you
on
with
the
new
nick
had
no
sooner
uttered
these
words
than
he
coloured
it
occurred
to
him
his
friend
would
probably
infer
an
allusion
to
julia
he
therefore
added
quickly
it
is
so
easy
to
cease
to
represent
an
affectionate
constituency
really
most
of
my
time
for
a
fortnight
has
been
given
to
they
all
been
unexpectedly
charming
i
should
have
thought
they
have
loathed
and
despised
me
but
not
a
bit
of
it
they
cling
to
me
fondly
they
struggle
with
me
tenderly
i
been
down
to
talk
with
them
about
it
and
passed
the
most
sociable
delightful
hours
i
designated
my
successor
i
felt
a
good
deal
like
the
emperor
charles
the
fifth
when
about
to
retire
to
the
monastery
of
yuste
the
more
i
seen
of
them
in
this
way
the
more
i
liked
them
and
they
declare
it
has
been
the
same
with
themselves
about
me
we
spend
our
time
assuring
each
other
we
had
begun
to
know
each
other
till
now
in
short
it
all
wonderfully
jolly
but
it
is
business
magnifique
mais
ce
pas
la
they
not
so
charming
as
they
might
be
if
they
do
offer
to
keep
you
and
let
you
paint
they
do
almost
it
fantastic
said
nick
remember
they
yet
seen
a
daub
of
my
brush
well
i
sorry
for
you
we
live
in
too
enlightened
an
age
peter
returned
you
ca
suffer
for
art
that
grand
romance
is
over
your
experience
is
interesting
it
seems
to
show
that
at
the
tremendous
pitch
of
civilisation
we
reached
you
ca
suffer
from
anything
but
hunger
i
shall
doubtless
nick
allowed
do
that
enough
to
make
up
for
the
rest
never
never
when
you
paint
so
well
as
this
oh
come
you
too
good
to
be
true
nick
said
but
where
did
you
learn
that
one
larder
full
in
proportion
as
one
work
fine
peter
waived
this
curious
point
he
only
continued
to
look
at
the
picture
after
which
he
roundly
brought
out
i
give
you
your
price
for
it
on
the
spot
ah
you
so
magnanimous
that
you
shall
have
it
for
nothing
and
nick
touched
to
gratitude
passed
his
arm
into
his
visitor
peter
had
a
pause
why
do
you
call
me
magnanimous
oh
bless
my
soul
it
hers
i
forgot
laughed
nick
failing
in
his
turn
to
answer
the
other
inquiry
but
you
shall
have
another
another
are
you
going
to
do
another
this
very
morning
that
is
i
shall
begin
it
i
heard
from
her
she
coming
to
sit
a
short
time
hence
peter
turned
away
a
little
at
this
releasing
himself
and
as
if
the
movement
had
been
an
effect
of
his
host
words
looked
at
his
watch
earnestly
to
dissipate
that
appearance
he
fell
back
to
consider
the
work
from
further
off
the
more
you
do
her
the
better
she
has
all
the
qualities
of
a
great
model
from
that
point
of
view
it
a
pity
she
has
another
trade
she
might
make
so
good
a
thing
of
this
one
but
how
shall
you
do
her
again
he
asked
ingenuously
oh
i
can
scarcely
say
we
arrange
something
we
talk
it
over
it
extraordinary
how
well
she
enters
into
what
one
wants
she
knows
more
than
one
does
one
self
she
is
as
you
frenchmen
say
the
first
comer
however
you
know
all
about
that
since
you
invented
her
did
you
that
what
she
says
she
awfully
sweet
on
you
nick
kindly
pursued
what
i
ought
to
do
is
to
try
something
as
different
as
possible
from
that
thing
not
the
sibyl
the
muse
the
tremendous
creature
but
the
charming
woman
the
person
one
knows
differently
arranged
as
she
appears
she
calls
it
i
do
something
really
serious
and
send
it
to
you
out
there
with
my
respects
it
will
remind
you
of
home
and
perhaps
a
little
even
of
me
if
she
knows
for
you
she
throw
herself
into
it
in
the
right
spirit
leave
it
to
us
my
dear
fellow
we
turn
out
something
splendid
it
jolly
to
hear
you
but
i
shall
send
you
a
cheque
said
peter
very
stoutly
i
suppose
it
all
right
in
your
position
but
you
too
proud
his
kinsman
answered
what
do
you
mean
by
my
position
your
exaltation
your
high
connexion
with
the
country
your
treating
with
sovereign
powers
as
the
representative
of
a
sovereign
power
that
what
they
call
peter
who
had
turned
round
again
listened
to
this
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
nick
face
while
he
once
more
drew
forth
his
watch
brute
he
exclaimed
familiarly
at
the
same
time
dropping
his
eyes
on
the
watch
when
did
you
say
you
expect
your
sitter
oh
we
plenty
of
time
do
be
afraid
of
letting
me
see
you
agitated
by
her
presence
brute
peter
again
ejaculated
this
friendly
personal
note
cleared
the
air
made
their
communication
closer
stay
with
me
and
talk
to
me
said
nick
i
daresay
it
good
for
me
it
may
be
the
last
time
i
shall
see
you
without
having
before
anything
else
to
beast
his
kinsman
once
more
and
a
little
helplessly
threw
off
though
next
going
on
have
you
something
more
to
show
me
then
some
other
fruit
of
your
genius
must
i
bribe
you
by
setting
my
in
a
row
you
know
what
done
by
which
i
mean
of
course
you
know
what
i
have
my
genius
as
you
so
good
as
to
call
it
has
hitherto
been
dreadfully
sterile
had
no
time
no
opportunity
no
continuity
i
must
go
and
sit
down
in
a
corner
and
learn
my
alphabet
that
thing
is
good
what
i
shall
do
for
you
wo
be
good
do
protest
my
dear
fellow
nothing
will
be
fit
to
look
at
for
a
long
time
after
which
poor
nick
wound
up
and
think
of
my
ridiculous
age
as
the
good
people
say
or
do
they
say
it
a
rum
go
it
wo
be
amusing
ah
you
so
clever
you
get
on
fast
peter
returned
trying
to
think
how
he
could
most
richly
defy
the
injunction
not
to
protest
i
mean
it
wo
be
amusing
for
others
said
nick
unperturbed
by
this
levity
they
want
results
and
small
blame
to
them
well
whatever
you
do
do
talk
like
gabriel
nash
peter
went
on
sometimes
i
think
you
just
going
to
nick
stared
a
moment
ah
he
never
would
have
said
want
results
the
damned
asses
that
would
have
been
more
in
his
key
it
the
difference
of
a
and
are
you
extraordinarily
happy
peter
added
as
his
host
now
obliged
him
by
arranging
canvases
so
that
he
could
look
at
them
not
so
much
so
doubtless
as
the
artistic
life
ought
to
make
one
because
all
one
people
are
not
so
infatuated
as
one
electors
but
little
by
little
i
learning
the
charm
of
your
mother
very
bad
peter
allowed
i
lunched
with
her
day
before
yesterday
yes
i
know
i
know
nick
had
such
reason
to
know
but
it
too
late
too
late
i
must
just
peg
away
here
and
not
mind
i
after
all
a
great
advantage
in
my
life
his
companion
waited
impartially
to
hear
and
that
would
be
well
knowing
what
i
want
to
do
that
everything
you
know
it
an
advantage
however
that
you
only
just
come
in
for
it
yes
but
the
delay
and
the
probation
only
make
me
prize
it
the
more
i
got
it
now
and
it
makes
up
for
the
absence
of
some
other
things
again
peter
had
a
pause
that
sounds
a
little
flat
he
remarked
at
last
it
depends
on
what
you
compare
it
with
it
has
more
point
than
i
sometimes
found
in
the
house
of
commons
oh
i
never
thought
i
should
like
that
there
was
another
drop
during
which
nick
moved
about
the
room
turning
up
old
sketches
to
see
if
he
had
anything
more
to
show
while
his
visitor
continued
to
look
at
the
unfinished
and
in
some
cases
as
seemed
unpromising
productions
already
exposed
they
were
far
less
interesting
than
the
portrait
of
miriam
rooth
and
it
would
have
appeared
less
significant
of
ability
for
that
particular
effort
nick
talent
had
taken
an
inspired
flight
so
much
peter
thought
as
he
had
thought
it
intensely
before
but
the
words
he
presently
uttered
had
no
visible
connexion
with
it
they
only
consisted
of
the
abrupt
inquiry
have
you
heard
anything
from
julia
not
a
syllable
have
you
dear
no
she
never
writes
to
me
but
wo
she
on
the
occasion
of
your
promotion
i
daresay
not
said
peter
and
this
was
the
only
reference
to
dallow
that
passed
between
her
brother
and
her
late
intended
it
left
a
slight
stir
of
the
air
which
peter
proceeded
to
allay
by
an
allusion
comparatively
speaking
more
relevant
he
expressed
disappointment
that
biddy
should
have
come
in
having
had
an
idea
she
was
always
in
rosedale
road
of
a
morning
that
was
the
other
branch
of
his
present
errand
the
wish
to
see
her
and
give
her
a
message
for
lady
agnes
upon
whom
at
so
early
an
hour
he
had
not
presumed
to
intrude
in
calcutta
gardens
nick
replied
that
biddy
did
in
point
of
fact
almost
always
turn
up
and
for
the
most
part
early
she
came
to
wish
him
and
start
him
for
the
day
she
was
a
devoted
electra
laying
a
cool
healing
hand
on
a
distracted
perspiring
orestes
he
reminded
peter
however
that
he
would
have
a
chance
of
seeing
her
that
evening
and
of
seeing
lady
agnes
for
was
he
to
do
them
the
honour
of
dining
in
calcutta
gardens
biddy
the
day
before
had
arrived
full
of
that
excitement
peter
explained
that
this
was
exactly
the
sad
subject
of
his
actual
the
project
of
the
dinner
in
calcutta
gardens
had
to
his
exceeding
regret
fallen
to
pieces
the
fact
was
did
nick
know
it
the
night
had
been
suddenly
and
perversely
fixed
for
miriam
première
and
he
was
under
a
definite
engagement
with
her
not
to
stay
away
from
it
to
add
to
the
bore
of
the
thing
he
was
obliged
to
return
to
paris
the
very
next
morning
he
was
quite
awfully
sorry
for
he
had
promised
lady
agnes
he
did
understand
then
about
miriam
affair
in
regard
to
which
he
had
given
a
previous
pledge
he
was
more
grieved
than
he
could
say
but
he
could
never
fail
miss
rooth
he
had
professed
from
the
first
an
interest
in
her
which
he
must
live
up
to
a
little
more
this
was
his
last
chance
he
had
been
near
her
at
the
trying
time
of
her
first
braving
of
the
public
and
the
second
night
of
the
play
do
it
must
be
the
first
or
nothing
besides
he
could
wait
over
till
monday
while
peter
recited
all
his
hindrance
nick
was
occupied
in
rubbing
with
a
cloth
a
palette
he
had
just
scraped
i
see
what
you
mean
i
very
sorry
too
i
sorry
you
ca
give
my
mother
this
joy
i
give
her
so
little
my
dear
fellow
you
might
give
her
a
little
more
it
came
to
peter
to
say
it
rather
too
much
to
expect
to
make
up
for
your
omissions
nick
looked
at
him
with
a
moment
fixedness
while
he
polished
the
palette
and
for
that
moment
he
felt
the
temptation
to
reply
there
a
way
you
could
do
that
to
a
considerable
extent
i
think
you
guess
it
which
would
be
intrinsically
disagreeable
but
the
impulse
passed
without
expressing
itself
in
speech
and
he
simply
brought
out
you
can
make
this
all
clear
to
biddy
when
she
comes
and
she
make
it
clear
to
my
mother
poor
little
biddy
peter
mentally
sighed
thinking
of
the
girl
with
that
job
before
her
but
what
he
articulated
was
that
this
was
exactly
why
he
had
come
to
the
studio
he
had
inflicted
his
company
on
lady
agnes
the
previous
thursday
and
had
partaken
of
a
meal
with
her
but
had
not
seen
biddy
though
he
had
waited
for
her
had
hoped
immensely
come
in
now
he
wait
again
dear
bid
was
thoroughly
worth
it
patience
patience
then
you
always
me
said
nick
to
which
he
subjoined
if
it
a
question
of
going
to
the
play
i
scarcely
see
why
you
should
dine
at
my
mother
all
the
same
people
go
to
the
play
after
dinner
yes
but
it
would
be
fair
it
would
be
decent
it
a
case
when
i
must
be
in
my
seat
from
the
rise
of
the
curtain
peter
about
this
was
thoroughly
lucid
i
should
force
your
mother
to
dine
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
and
then
in
return
for
her
courtesy
should
go
off
to
my
entertainment
at
eight
leaving
her
and
grace
and
biddy
languishing
there
i
wish
i
had
proposed
in
time
that
they
should
go
with
me
he
continued
not
very
ingenuously
you
might
do
that
still
nick
suggested
oh
at
this
time
of
day
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
a
box
i
speak
to
miss
rooth
about
it
if
you
like
when
she
comes
smiled
nick
no
it
would
do
said
peter
turning
away
and
looking
once
more
at
his
watch
he
made
tacitly
the
addition
that
still
less
than
asking
lady
agnes
for
his
convenience
to
dine
early
would
be
decent
would
it
be
thinkable
his
taking
biddy
the
night
he
dined
with
her
and
with
miss
tressilian
had
been
something
very
like
a
violation
of
those
proprieties
he
could
say
that
however
to
the
girl
brother
who
remarked
in
a
moment
that
it
was
all
right
since
peter
action
left
him
his
own
freedom
your
own
freedom
and
peter
question
made
him
turn
why
you
see
now
i
can
go
to
the
theatre
myself
certainly
i
had
thought
of
that
you
naturally
have
been
going
i
gave
it
up
for
the
prospect
of
your
company
at
home
upon
my
word
you
too
good
i
do
deserve
such
sacrifices
said
peter
who
read
in
his
kinsman
face
that
this
was
not
a
figure
of
speech
but
the
absolute
truth
did
it
however
occur
to
you
that
as
it
would
turn
out
i
might
i
even
naturally
myself
be
going
he
put
forth
nick
broke
into
a
laugh
it
would
have
occurred
to
me
if
i
understood
a
little
better
but
he
paused
as
still
too
amused
if
you
understood
a
little
better
what
your
situation
simply
peter
looked
at
him
a
moment
dine
with
me
by
ourselves
and
at
a
club
we
go
to
the
theatre
together
and
then
you
understand
it
with
pleasure
with
pleasure
we
have
a
jolly
evening
said
nick
call
it
jolly
if
you
like
when
did
you
say
she
was
coming
peter
asked
biddy
oh
probably
as
i
tell
you
at
any
moment
i
mean
the
great
miriam
peter
amended
the
great
miriam
if
she
punctual
will
be
here
in
about
forty
minutes
and
will
she
be
likely
to
find
your
sister
that
will
depend
my
dear
fellow
on
whether
my
sister
remains
to
see
her
exactly
but
the
point
whether
you
allow
her
to
remain
is
it
nick
looked
slightly
mystified
why
should
she
do
as
she
likes
in
that
case
she
probably
go
yes
unless
she
stays
do
let
her
peter
dropped
send
her
away
and
to
explain
this
he
added
it
does
seem
exactly
the
right
sort
of
thing
fresh
young
creatures
like
bid
meeting
femmes
de
his
explanation
in
turn
struck
him
as
requiring
another
clause
so
he
went
on
at
least
it
is
thought
the
right
sort
of
thing
abroad
and
even
in
england
my
foreign
ideas
stick
to
me
even
with
this
amplification
however
his
plea
evidently
still
had
for
his
companion
a
flaw
which
after
he
had
considered
it
a
moment
nick
exposed
in
the
simple
words
why
you
originally
introduced
them
in
paris
biddy
and
miss
rooth
did
they
meet
at
your
rooms
and
fraternise
and
was
that
much
more
than
this
so
they
did
but
my
hand
had
been
forced
and
she
did
like
it
peter
answered
suspecting
that
for
a
diplomatist
he
looked
foolish
miss
rooth
did
like
it
nick
persisted
that
i
confess
i
forgotten
besides
she
was
an
actress
then
what
i
mean
is
that
biddy
was
particularly
pleased
with
her
why
she
thought
her
wonderful
praised
her
to
the
sides
i
remember
that
she
did
like
her
as
a
woman
she
praised
her
as
an
actress
i
thought
you
said
she
was
an
actress
then
nick
returned
peter
had
a
pause
oh
biddy
thought
so
she
has
seen
her
since
moreover
i
took
her
the
other
night
and
her
curiosity
satisfied
it
not
of
any
consequence
and
if
there
a
reason
for
it
i
bundle
her
off
directly
nick
made
haste
to
say
but
the
great
miriam
seems
such
a
kind
good
person
so
she
is
charming
charming
and
his
visitor
looked
hard
at
him
here
comes
biddy
now
nick
went
on
i
hear
her
at
the
door
you
can
warn
her
yourself
it
is
a
question
of
that
not
in
the
least
my
idea
but
i
take
biddy
away
said
peter
that
will
be
still
more
energetic
no
it
will
be
simply
more
selfish
i
like
her
company
peter
had
turned
as
if
to
go
to
the
door
and
meet
the
girl
but
he
quickly
checked
himself
lingering
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
the
next
instant
biddy
had
come
in
when
she
saw
him
there
she
also
stopped
xliii
come
on
boldly
my
dear
said
nick
peter
bored
to
death
waiting
for
you
ah
he
come
to
say
he
wo
dine
with
us
biddy
stood
with
her
hand
on
the
latch
i
leave
town
i
everything
to
do
i
impossible
peter
made
of
it
again
such
a
case
as
he
could
please
make
my
peace
with
your
mother
i
ashamed
of
not
having
written
to
her
last
night
she
closed
the
door
and
came
in
while
her
brother
said
to
her
how
in
the
world
did
you
guess
it
i
saw
it
in
the
and
she
kept
her
eyes
on
their
kinsman
in
the
he
vaguely
echoed
i
saw
there
to
be
a
first
night
at
that
theatre
the
one
you
took
us
to
so
i
said
he
go
there
yes
i
got
to
do
that
too
peter
admitted
she
going
to
sit
to
me
again
this
morning
his
wonderful
actress
she
has
made
an
appointment
so
you
see
i
getting
on
nick
pursued
to
his
sister
oh
i
so
glad
she
so
splendid
the
girl
looked
away
from
her
cousin
now
but
not
though
it
seemed
to
fill
the
place
at
the
triumphant
portrait
of
miriam
rooth
i
delighted
you
come
in
i
waited
for
you
peter
hastened
to
declare
to
her
though
conscious
that
this
was
in
the
conditions
meagre
are
you
coming
to
see
us
again
i
in
despair
but
i
shall
really
not
have
time
therefore
it
a
blessing
not
to
have
missed
you
here
i
very
glad
said
biddy
then
she
added
and
you
going
to
america
to
stay
a
long
time
till
i
sent
to
some
better
place
and
will
that
better
place
be
as
far
away
oh
biddy
it
would
be
better
then
said
peter
do
you
mean
they
give
you
something
to
do
at
home
hardly
that
but
i
a
tremendous
lot
to
do
at
home
for
the
twentieth
time
peter
referred
to
his
watch
she
turned
to
her
brother
who
had
admonished
her
that
she
might
bid
him
she
kissed
him
and
he
asked
what
the
news
would
be
in
calcutta
gardens
to
which
she
made
answer
the
only
news
is
of
course
the
great
preparations
they
making
poor
dears
for
peter
mamma
thinks
you
must
have
had
such
a
nasty
dinner
the
other
day
the
girl
continued
to
the
guest
of
that
romantic
occasion
faithless
peter
said
nick
beginning
to
whistle
and
to
arrange
a
canvas
in
anticipation
of
miriam
arrival
dear
biddy
thank
your
stars
you
not
in
my
horrid
profession
protested
the
personage
so
designated
one
bowled
about
like
a
unable
to
answer
for
one
freedom
or
one
comfort
from
one
moment
to
another
oh
ours
is
the
true
profession
biddy
and
mine
nick
broke
out
setting
up
his
canvas
the
career
of
liberty
and
peace
of
charming
long
mornings
spent
in
a
still
north
light
and
in
the
contemplation
i
may
even
say
in
the
company
of
the
amiable
and
the
beautiful
that
certainty
the
case
when
biddy
comes
to
see
you
peter
returned
biddy
smiled
at
him
i
come
every
day
son
pittore
i
encourage
nick
awfully
it
a
pity
i
not
a
martyr
she
bravely
perish
with
me
nick
said
you
are
you
a
martyr
when
people
say
such
odious
things
the
girl
cried
they
do
say
them
i
heard
many
more
than
i
repeated
to
you
it
you
yourself
then
indignant
and
loyal
who
are
the
martyr
observed
peter
who
wanted
greatly
to
be
kind
to
her
oh
i
do
care
but
she
threw
herself
flushed
and
charming
into
a
straight
appeal
to
him
do
you
think
one
can
do
as
much
good
by
painting
great
works
of
art
as
by
as
by
what
papa
used
to
do
do
you
think
art
necessary
to
the
happiness
to
the
greatness
of
a
people
do
you
think
it
manly
and
honourable
do
you
think
a
passion
for
it
a
thing
to
be
ashamed
of
do
you
think
the
artist
the
conscientious
the
serious
one
is
as
distinguished
a
member
of
society
as
any
one
else
peter
and
nick
looked
at
each
other
and
laughed
at
the
way
she
had
got
up
her
subject
and
nick
asked
their
kinsman
if
she
did
express
it
all
in
perfection
i
delight
in
general
in
artists
but
i
delight
still
more
in
their
defenders
peter
made
reply
perhaps
a
little
meagrely
to
biddy
ah
do
attack
me
if
you
wise
nick
said
one
tempted
to
when
it
makes
biddy
so
fine
well
that
the
way
she
encourages
me
it
meat
and
drink
to
me
nick
went
on
at
the
same
time
i
bound
to
say
there
a
little
whistling
in
the
dark
in
it
in
the
dark
his
sister
demanded
the
obscurity
my
dear
child
of
your
own
aspirations
your
mysterious
ambitions
and
esthetic
views
are
there
some
heavyish
shadows
there
why
i
never
cared
for
politics
no
but
you
cared
for
life
you
cared
for
society
and
you
chosen
the
path
of
solitude
and
concentration
you
horrid
boy
said
biddy
give
it
up
that
arduous
steep
give
it
up
and
come
out
with
me
peter
interposed
come
out
with
you
let
us
walk
a
little
or
even
drive
a
little
let
us
at
any
rate
talk
a
little
i
thought
you
had
so
much
to
do
biddy
candidly
objected
so
i
have
but
why
should
you
do
a
part
of
it
with
me
would
there
be
any
harm
i
going
to
some
tiresome
shops
you
cheer
the
frugal
hour
the
girl
hesitated
then
turned
to
nick
would
there
be
any
harm
oh
it
none
of
business
peter
protested
he
had
better
take
you
home
to
your
mother
i
going
home
i
sha
stay
here
biddy
went
on
then
to
peter
i
came
in
a
hansom
but
i
shall
walk
back
come
that
way
with
me
with
pleasure
but
i
shall
not
be
able
to
go
in
peter
added
oh
that
no
matter
said
the
girl
nick
you
understand
then
that
we
dine
together
at
seven
sharp
would
a
club
as
i
say
be
best
peter
before
going
inquired
of
nick
he
suggested
further
which
club
it
should
be
and
his
words
led
biddy
who
had
directed
her
steps
toward
the
door
to
turn
a
moment
as
with
a
reproachful
question
whether
it
was
for
this
peter
had
given
up
calcutta
gardens
but
her
impulse
if
impulse
it
was
had
no
sequel
save
so
far
as
it
was
a
sequel
that
peter
freely
explained
to
her
after
nick
had
assented
to
his
conditions
that
her
brother
too
had
a
desire
to
go
to
miss
rooth
first
night
and
had
already
promised
to
accompany
him
oh
that
perfect
it
will
be
so
good
for
him
wo
it
if
he
going
to
paint
her
again
biddy
responded
i
think
there
nothing
so
good
for
him
as
that
he
happens
to
have
such
a
sister
as
you
peter
declared
as
they
went
out
he
heard
at
the
same
time
the
sound
of
a
carriage
stopping
and
before
biddy
who
was
in
front
of
him
opened
the
door
of
the
house
had
been
able
to
say
to
himself
what
a
bore
there
miriam
the
opened
door
showed
him
that
truth
this
young
lady
in
the
act
of
alighting
from
the
brougham
provided
by
basil
dashwood
thrifty
zeal
her
mother
followed
her
and
both
the
new
visitors
exclaimed
and
rejoiced
in
their
demonstrative
way
as
their
eyes
fell
on
their
valued
friend
the
door
had
closed
behind
peter
but
he
instantly
and
violently
rang
so
that
they
should
be
admitted
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
while
he
stood
disconcerted
and
fearing
he
showed
it
by
the
prompt
occurrence
of
an
encounter
he
had
particularly
sought
to
avert
it
ministered
moreover
a
little
to
this
sensibility
that
miriam
appeared
to
have
come
somewhat
before
her
time
the
incident
promised
however
to
pass
off
in
a
fine
florid
way
before
he
knew
it
both
the
ladies
had
taken
possession
of
biddy
who
looked
at
them
with
comparative
coldness
tempered
indeed
by
a
faint
glow
of
apprehension
and
miriam
had
broken
out
we
know
you
we
know
you
we
saw
you
in
paris
and
you
came
to
my
theatre
a
short
time
ago
with
mr
sherringham
we
know
your
mother
lady
agnes
dormer
i
hope
her
ladyship
very
well
said
rooth
who
had
never
struck
peter
as
a
more
objectionable
old
woman
you
offered
to
do
a
head
of
me
or
something
or
other
did
you
tell
me
you
work
in
clay
i
daresay
you
forgotten
all
about
it
but
i
should
be
delighted
miriam
pursued
with
the
richest
urbanity
peter
was
not
concerned
with
her
mother
pervasiveness
though
he
did
like
biddy
to
see
even
that
but
he
hoped
his
companion
would
take
the
overcharged
benevolence
of
the
young
actress
in
the
spirit
in
which
rather
to
his
surprise
it
evidently
was
offered
i
sat
to
your
clever
brother
many
times
said
miriam
i
going
to
sit
again
i
daresay
you
seen
what
we
done
he
too
delightful
vous
saviez
comme
cela
me
she
added
turning
for
a
moment
to
peter
then
she
continued
smiling
at
biddy
only
he
ought
to
have
thrown
up
such
prospects
you
know
i
an
idea
i
was
nice
to
you
that
day
in
paris
i
was
nervous
and
scared
and
perverse
i
remember
perfectly
i
odious
but
i
better
now
you
see
if
you
were
to
know
me
not
a
bad
sort
really
i
not
but
you
must
have
your
own
friends
happy
they
you
look
so
charming
immensely
like
dormer
especially
about
the
eyes
is
she
mamma
she
comes
of
a
beautiful
norman
race
the
finest
purest
strain
the
old
woman
simpered
dormer
sometimes
so
good
as
to
come
and
see
us
we
always
at
home
on
sunday
and
if
some
day
you
found
courage
to
come
with
him
you
might
perhaps
find
it
pleasant
though
very
different
of
course
from
the
circle
in
which
you
habitually
move
biddy
murmured
a
vague
recognition
of
these
wonderful
civilities
and
miriam
commented
different
yes
but
we
all
right
you
know
do
come
she
added
then
turning
to
sherringham
remember
what
i
told
you
i
do
expect
you
oh
i
understand
i
shall
come
and
peter
knew
he
grew
red
it
will
be
idiotic
keep
him
keep
him
away
do
let
him
miriam
insisted
to
biddy
with
which
as
nick
portals
now
were
gaping
she
drew
her
mother
away
peter
at
this
walked
off
briskly
with
biddy
dropping
as
he
did
so
she
too
fantastic
yes
but
so
tremendously
i
shall
ask
nick
to
take
me
there
the
girl
said
after
a
moment
well
she
do
you
no
harm
they
all
right
as
she
says
it
the
world
of
art
you
were
standing
up
so
for
art
just
now
oh
i
was
thinking
so
much
of
that
kind
she
demurred
there
only
one
kind
it
all
the
same
thing
if
one
sort
good
the
other
is
biddy
walked
along
a
moment
is
she
serious
is
she
conscientious
she
has
the
makings
of
a
great
artist
peter
opined
i
glad
to
hear
you
think
a
woman
can
be
one
in
that
line
there
has
never
been
any
doubt
about
it
and
only
in
that
line
i
mean
on
the
stage
in
general
dramatic
or
lyric
it
as
the
actress
that
the
woman
produces
the
most
complete
and
satisfactory
artistic
results
and
only
as
the
actress
he
weighed
it
yes
there
another
art
in
which
she
not
bad
which
one
do
you
mean
asked
biddy
that
of
being
charming
and
good
that
of
being
indispensable
to
man
oh
that
is
an
art
then
you
leave
her
only
the
stage
take
it
if
you
like
in
the
widest
sense
biddy
appeared
to
reflect
a
moment
as
to
judge
what
sense
this
might
be
but
she
found
none
that
was
wide
enough
for
she
cried
the
next
minute
do
you
mean
to
say
there
nothing
for
a
woman
but
to
be
an
actress
never
in
my
life
i
only
say
that
that
the
best
thing
for
a
woman
to
be
who
finds
herself
irresistibly
carried
into
the
practice
of
the
arts
for
there
her
capacity
for
them
has
most
application
and
her
incapacity
for
them
least
but
at
the
same
time
i
strongly
recommend
her
not
to
be
an
artist
if
she
can
possibly
help
it
it
a
devil
of
a
life
oh
i
know
men
want
women
not
to
be
anything
it
a
poor
little
refuge
they
try
to
take
from
the
overwhelming
consciousness
that
you
in
very
fact
everything
everything
and
the
girl
gave
a
toss
that
the
kind
of
thing
you
say
to
keep
us
quiet
dear
biddy
you
see
how
well
we
succeed
laughed
peter
to
which
she
replied
by
asking
irrelevantly
why
is
it
so
necessary
for
you
to
go
to
the
theatre
if
miss
rooth
does
want
you
to
my
dear
child
she
does
want
me
to
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
why
then
did
she
say
that
she
does
oh
because
she
meant
just
the
contrary
is
she
so
false
then
is
she
so
vulgar
she
speaks
a
special
language
practically
it
is
false
because
it
renders
her
thought
and
those
who
know
her
understand
it
but
she
does
use
it
only
to
those
who
know
her
biddy
returned
since
she
asked
me
who
have
so
little
the
honour
of
her
acquaintance
to
keep
you
away
how
am
i
to
know
that
she
meant
by
that
that
i
to
urge
you
on
to
go
he
was
on
the
point
of
replying
because
you
my
word
for
it
but
he
shrank
in
fact
from
giving
his
word
he
had
some
fine
scruples
and
sought
to
relieve
his
embarrassment
by
a
general
tribute
dear
biddy
you
delightfully
acute
you
quite
as
clever
as
miss
rooth
he
felt
however
that
this
was
scarcely
adequate
and
he
continued
the
truth
is
that
its
being
important
for
me
to
go
is
a
matter
quite
independent
of
that
young
lady
wishing
it
or
not
wishing
it
there
happens
to
be
a
definite
intrinsic
propriety
in
it
which
determines
the
thing
and
which
it
would
take
me
long
to
explain
i
see
but
fancy
your
to
me
you
make
me
feel
so
indiscreet
the
girl
cried
quickly
an
exclamation
which
touched
him
because
he
was
not
aware
that
quick
as
it
had
been
she
had
still
had
time
to
be
struck
first
though
she
would
for
the
world
have
expressed
it
with
the
oddity
of
such
a
duty
at
such
a
season
in
fact
that
oddity
during
a
silence
of
some
minutes
came
back
to
peter
himself
the
note
had
been
forced
it
sounded
almost
ignobly
frivolous
from
a
man
on
the
eve
of
proceeding
to
a
high
diplomatic
post
the
effect
of
this
none
the
less
was
not
to
make
him
break
out
with
hang
it
i
keep
my
engagement
to
your
mother
but
to
fill
him
with
the
wish
to
shorten
his
present
strain
by
taking
biddy
the
rest
of
the
way
in
a
cab
he
was
uncomfortable
and
there
were
hansoms
about
that
he
looked
at
wistfully
while
he
was
so
occupied
his
companion
took
up
the
talk
by
an
abrupt
appeal
why
did
she
say
that
nick
ought
to
have
resigned
his
seat
oh
i
do
know
it
struck
her
so
it
does
matter
much
but
biddy
kept
it
up
if
she
an
artist
herself
why
does
she
like
people
to
go
in
for
art
especially
when
nick
has
given
his
time
to
painting
her
so
beautifully
why
does
she
come
there
so
often
if
she
disapproves
of
what
he
has
done
oh
miriam
disapproval
it
does
count
it
a
manner
of
speaking
of
speaking
untruths
do
you
mean
does
she
think
just
the
reverse
is
that
the
way
she
talks
about
everything
we
always
admire
most
what
we
can
do
least
peter
brought
forth
and
miriam
of
course
is
political
she
ranks
painters
more
or
less
with
her
own
profession
about
which
already
new
as
she
is
to
it
she
has
no
illusions
they
all
artists
it
the
same
general
sort
of
thing
she
prefers
men
of
the
world
men
of
action
is
that
the
reason
she
likes
you
biddy
mildly
mocked
ah
she
does
like
me
could
you
see
it
the
girl
at
first
said
nothing
then
she
asked
is
that
why
she
lets
you
call
her
oh
i
do
to
her
face
ah
only
to
mine
laughed
biddy
one
says
that
as
one
says
of
her
great
predecessor
except
that
she
is
so
great
quite
yet
is
she
far
from
it
she
the
freshest
of
novices
she
has
scarcely
been
four
months
on
the
stage
but
no
novice
has
ever
been
such
an
adept
go
very
fast
peter
pursued
and
i
daresay
that
before
long
she
be
magnificent
what
a
pity
you
not
see
that
biddy
sighed
after
a
pause
not
see
it
if
you
thousands
of
miles
away
it
is
a
pity
peter
said
and
since
you
mention
it
i
do
mind
frankly
telling
you
throwing
myself
on
your
mercy
as
it
were
that
that
why
i
make
such
a
point
of
a
rare
occasion
like
i
a
weakness
for
the
drama
that
as
you
perhaps
know
i
never
concealed
and
this
impression
will
probably
have
to
last
me
in
some
barren
spot
for
many
many
years
i
understand
i
understand
i
hope
therefore
it
will
be
charming
and
the
girl
walked
faster
just
as
some
other
charming
impressions
will
have
to
last
peter
added
conscious
of
keeping
up
with
her
by
some
effort
she
seemed
almost
to
be
running
away
from
him
an
impression
that
led
him
to
suggest
after
they
had
proceeded
a
little
further
without
more
words
that
if
she
were
in
a
hurry
they
had
perhaps
better
take
a
cab
her
face
was
strange
and
touching
to
him
as
she
turned
it
to
make
answer
oh
i
not
in
the
least
in
a
hurry
and
i
really
think
i
had
better
walk
we
walk
then
by
all
means
peter
said
with
slightly
exaggerated
gaiety
in
pursuance
of
which
they
went
on
a
hundred
yards
biddy
kept
the
same
pace
yet
it
was
scarcely
a
surprise
to
him
that
she
should
suddenly
stop
with
the
exclamation
after
all
though
i
not
in
a
hurry
i
tired
i
had
better
have
a
cab
please
call
that
one
she
added
looking
about
her
they
were
in
a
straight
blank
ugly
street
where
the
small
cheap
houses
had
no
expression
save
that
of
a
rueful
unconsoled
acknowledgment
of
the
universal
want
of
identity
they
would
have
constituted
a
terrace
if
they
could
but
they
had
dolefully
given
it
up
even
a
hansom
that
loitered
across
the
end
of
the
vista
turned
a
sceptical
back
upon
it
so
that
sherringham
had
to
lift
his
voice
in
a
loud
appeal
he
stood
with
biddy
watching
the
cab
approach
them
this
is
one
of
the
charming
things
you
remember
she
said
turning
her
eyes
to
the
general
dreariness
from
the
particular
figure
of
the
vehicle
which
was
antiquated
and
clumsy
before
he
could
reply
she
had
lightly
stepped
into
the
cab
but
as
he
answered
most
assuredly
it
is
and
prepared
to
follow
her
she
quickly
closed
the
apron
i
must
go
alone
you
lots
of
things
to
do
it
all
right
and
through
the
aperture
in
the
roof
she
gave
the
driver
her
address
she
had
spoken
with
decision
and
peter
fully
felt
now
that
she
wished
to
get
away
from
him
her
eyes
betrayed
it
as
well
as
her
voice
in
a
look
a
strange
wandering
ray
that
as
he
stood
there
with
his
hand
on
the
cab
he
had
time
to
take
from
her
peter
she
smiled
and
as
the
thing
began
to
rumble
away
he
uttered
the
same
tepid
ridiculous
farewell
xliv
at
the
entrance
of
miriam
and
her
mother
nick
in
the
studio
had
stopped
whistling
but
he
was
still
gay
enough
to
receive
them
with
every
appearance
of
warmth
he
thought
it
a
poor
place
ungarnished
untapestried
a
bare
almost
grim
workshop
with
all
its
revelations
and
honours
still
to
come
but
his
visitors
smiled
on
it
a
good
deal
in
the
same
way
in
which
they
had
smiled
on
bridget
dormer
when
they
met
her
at
the
door
rooth
because
vague
prudent
approbation
was
the
habit
of
her
foolish
face
it
was
ever
the
least
danger
and
miriam
because
as
seemed
she
was
genuinely
glad
to
find
herself
within
the
walls
of
which
she
spoke
now
as
her
asylum
she
broke
out
in
this
strain
to
her
host
almost
as
soon
as
she
had
crossed
the
threshold
commending
his
circumstances
his
conditions
of
work
as
infinitely
happier
than
her
own
he
was
quiet
independent
absolute
free
to
do
what
he
liked
as
he
liked
it
shut
up
in
his
little
temple
with
his
altar
and
his
divinity
not
hustled
about
in
a
mob
of
people
having
to
posture
and
grin
to
pit
and
gallery
to
square
himself
at
every
step
with
insufferable
conventions
and
with
the
ignorance
and
vanity
of
others
he
was
blissfully
alone
mercy
how
you
do
abuse
your
fine
profession
i
sure
i
never
urged
you
to
adopt
it
rooth
cried
in
real
bewilderment
to
her
daughter
she
was
abusing
mine
still
more
the
other
day
joked
nick
telling
me
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
it
and
of
myself
oh
i
never
know
from
one
moment
to
the
other
i
live
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
sighed
the
old
woman
are
you
quiet
about
the
great
thing
about
my
personal
behaviour
miriam
smiled
my
improprieties
are
all
of
the
mind
i
do
know
what
you
your
personal
behaviour
her
mother
objected
you
would
very
soon
if
it
were
not
what
it
is
and
i
do
know
why
you
should
wish
to
have
it
thought
you
a
wicked
mind
rooth
agreeably
grumbled
yes
but
i
do
see
very
well
how
i
can
make
you
understand
that
at
any
rate
miriam
pursued
with
her
grand
eyes
on
nick
i
retract
what
i
said
the
other
day
about
dormer
i
no
wish
to
quarrel
with
him
on
the
way
he
has
determined
to
dispose
of
his
life
because
after
all
it
does
suit
me
very
well
it
rests
me
this
little
devoted
corner
oh
it
rests
me
it
out
of
the
row
and
the
dust
it
deliciously
still
and
they
ca
get
at
me
ah
when
art
like
this
la
bonne
and
she
looked
round
on
such
a
presentment
of
art
in
a
splendid
way
that
produced
amusement
on
the
young
man
part
at
its
contrast
with
the
humble
fact
miriam
shone
upon
him
as
if
she
liked
to
be
the
cause
of
his
mirth
and
went
on
appealing
to
him
you
always
let
me
come
here
for
an
hour
wo
you
to
take
breath
to
let
the
whirlwind
pass
you
need
trouble
yourself
about
me
i
do
mean
to
impose
on
you
in
the
least
the
necessity
of
painting
me
though
if
that
a
manner
of
helping
you
to
get
on
you
may
be
sure
it
will
always
be
open
to
you
do
what
you
like
with
me
in
that
respect
only
let
me
sit
here
on
a
high
stool
keeping
well
out
of
your
way
and
see
what
you
happen
to
be
doing
tell
you
my
own
adventures
when
you
want
to
hear
them
the
fewer
adventures
you
have
to
tell
the
better
my
dear
said
rooth
and
if
dormer
keeps
you
quiet
he
add
ten
years
to
my
life
it
all
makes
an
interesting
comment
on
dormer
own
quietness
on
his
independence
and
sweet
solitude
nick
observed
miss
rooth
has
to
work
with
others
which
is
after
all
only
what
dormer
has
to
do
when
he
works
with
miss
rooth
what
do
you
make
of
the
inevitable
sitter
oh
answered
miriam
you
can
say
to
the
inevitable
sitter
your
tongue
you
brute
is
it
a
good
deal
in
that
manner
that
i
heard
you
address
your
comrades
at
the
theatre
rooth
inquired
that
why
my
heart
in
my
mouth
yes
but
they
hit
me
back
they
reply
to
me
de
as
i
should
never
think
of
replying
to
dormer
it
a
great
advantage
to
him
that
when
he
peremptory
with
his
model
it
only
makes
her
better
adds
to
her
expression
of
gloomy
grandeur
we
did
the
gloomy
grandeur
in
the
other
picture
suppose
therefore
we
try
something
different
in
this
nick
threw
off
it
serious
it
grand
murmured
rooth
who
had
taken
up
a
rapt
attitude
before
the
portrait
of
her
daughter
it
makes
one
wonder
what
she
thinking
of
beautiful
commendable
things
what
it
seems
to
say
what
can
i
be
thinking
of
but
the
tremendous
wisdom
of
my
mother
miriam
returned
i
brought
her
this
morning
to
see
that
thing
she
had
only
seen
it
in
its
earliest
stage
and
not
to
presume
to
advise
you
about
anything
else
you
may
be
so
good
as
to
embark
on
she
wanted
or
professed
she
wanted
terribly
to
know
what
you
had
finally
arrived
at
she
was
too
impatient
to
wait
till
you
should
send
it
home
ah
send
it
home
send
it
home
let
us
have
it
always
with
us
rooth
engagingly
said
it
will
keep
us
up
up
and
up
on
the
heights
near
the
stars
be
always
for
us
a
symbol
and
a
reminder
you
see
i
was
right
miriam
went
on
for
she
appreciates
thoroughly
in
her
own
way
and
almost
understands
but
if
she
worries
or
distracts
you
i
send
her
directly
home
i
kept
the
carriage
there
on
purpose
i
must
add
that
i
do
feel
quite
safe
in
letting
her
out
of
my
sight
she
liable
to
make
dashes
at
the
theatre
and
play
unconscionable
tricks
there
i
shall
never
again
accuse
mamma
of
a
want
of
interest
in
my
profession
her
interest
exceeds
even
my
own
she
all
over
the
place
and
she
has
ideas
ah
but
ideas
she
capable
of
turning
up
at
the
theatre
at
five
this
afternoon
to
demand
the
repainting
of
the
set
in
the
third
act
for
myself
i
not
a
word
more
to
say
on
the
subject
i
accepted
every
danger
i
swallowed
my
fate
everything
no
doubt
wrong
but
nothing
can
possibly
be
right
let
us
eat
and
drink
for
we
die
if
you
say
so
mamma
shall
go
and
sit
in
the
carriage
and
as
there
no
means
of
fastening
the
doors
is
there
your
servant
shall
keep
guard
over
her
just
as
you
are
now
be
so
good
as
to
remain
so
sitting
just
that
way
leaning
back
with
a
smile
in
your
eyes
and
one
hand
on
the
sofa
beside
you
and
supporting
you
a
little
i
shall
stick
a
flower
into
the
other
hand
let
it
lie
in
your
lap
just
as
it
is
keep
that
thing
on
your
head
it
admirably
uncovered
do
you
call
such
an
unconsidered
trifle
a
bonnet
and
let
your
head
fall
back
a
little
there
it
is
it
found
this
time
i
shall
really
do
something
and
it
will
be
as
different
as
you
like
from
that
other
crazy
job
here
we
go
it
was
in
these
irrelevant
but
earnest
words
that
nick
responded
to
his
uttered
vagaries
of
which
her
charming
tone
and
countenance
diminished
the
superficial
acerbity
he
held
up
his
hands
a
moment
to
fix
her
in
her
limits
and
in
a
few
minutes
had
a
happy
sense
of
having
begun
to
work
the
smile
in
her
eyes
do
forget
the
smile
in
her
eyes
rooth
softly
chanted
turning
away
and
creeping
about
the
room
that
will
make
it
so
different
from
the
other
picture
and
show
the
two
sides
of
her
genius
the
wonderful
range
between
them
they
be
splendid
mates
and
though
i
daresay
i
shall
strike
you
as
greedy
you
must
let
me
hope
you
send
this
one
home
too
she
explored
the
place
discreetly
and
on
tiptoe
talking
twaddle
as
she
went
and
bending
her
head
and
her
eyeglass
over
various
objects
with
an
air
of
imperfect
comprehension
that
did
prevent
nick
private
recall
of
the
story
of
her
underhand
commercial
habits
told
by
gabriel
nash
at
the
exhibition
in
paris
the
first
time
her
name
had
fallen
on
his
ear
a
queer
old
woman
from
whom
if
you
approached
her
in
the
right
way
you
could
buy
old
pots
it
was
in
this
character
that
she
had
originally
been
introduced
to
him
he
had
lost
sight
of
it
afterwards
but
it
revived
again
as
his
observant
eyes
at
the
same
time
that
they
followed
his
active
hand
became
aware
of
her
instinctive
appraising
gestures
there
was
a
moment
when
he
frankly
laughed
out
there
was
so
little
in
his
poor
studio
to
appraise
rooth
wandering
eyeglass
and
vague
polite
disappointed
bent
back
and
head
made
a
subject
for
a
sketch
on
the
instant
they
gave
such
a
sudden
pictorial
glimpse
of
the
element
of
race
he
found
himself
seeing
the
immemorial
jewess
in
her
hold
up
a
candle
in
a
crammed
back
shop
there
was
no
candle
indeed
and
his
studio
was
not
crammed
and
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
before
that
she
was
a
of
israel
save
on
the
general
theory
so
stoutly
held
by
several
clever
people
that
few
of
us
are
not
under
suspicion
the
late
rudolf
roth
had
at
least
been
and
his
daughter
was
visibly
her
child
so
that
flanked
by
such
a
pair
good
semitic
presumptions
sufficiently
crowned
the
mother
receiving
miriam
sharp
satiric
shower
without
shaking
her
shoulders
she
might
at
any
rate
have
been
the
descendant
of
a
tribe
long
persecuted
her
blandness
was
beyond
all
baiting
she
professed
she
could
be
as
still
as
a
mouse
miriam
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
in
the
tranquil
beauty
of
her
attitude
found
indeed
as
nick
had
said
watched
her
a
little
and
then
declared
she
had
best
have
been
locked
up
at
home
putting
aside
her
free
account
of
the
dangers
to
which
her
mother
exposed
her
it
was
whimsical
to
imagine
that
within
the
limits
of
that
repose
from
which
the
never
wholly
departed
the
elder
lady
might
indeed
be
a
trifle
fidgety
and
have
something
on
her
mind
nick
presently
mentioned
that
it
would
be
possible
for
him
to
send
home
his
second
performance
and
he
added
in
the
exuberance
of
having
already
got
a
little
into
relation
with
his
work
that
perhaps
this
did
matter
inasmuch
as
if
miriam
would
give
him
his
time
to
say
nothing
of
her
own
a
third
and
a
fourth
masterpiece
might
also
some
day
very
well
struggle
into
the
light
his
model
rose
to
this
without
conditions
assuring
him
he
might
count
upon
her
till
she
grew
too
old
and
too
ugly
and
that
nothing
would
make
her
so
happy
as
that
he
should
paint
her
as
often
as
romney
had
painted
the
celebrated
lady
hamilton
ah
lady
hamilton
deprecated
rooth
while
miriam
who
had
on
occasion
the
candour
of
a
fine
acquisitiveness
wished
to
know
what
particular
reason
there
might
be
for
his
not
letting
them
have
the
picture
he
was
now
beginning
why
i
promised
it
to
peter
sherringham
he
has
offered
me
money
for
it
nick
replied
however
he
welcome
to
it
for
nothing
poor
chap
and
i
shall
be
delighted
to
do
the
best
i
can
for
him
rooth
still
prowling
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
room
at
this
while
her
daughter
echoed
he
offered
you
money
just
as
we
came
in
you
met
him
then
at
the
door
with
my
sister
i
supposed
you
had
taking
her
home
nick
explained
your
sister
a
lovely
girl
such
an
aristocratic
type
breathed
rooth
then
she
added
i
a
tremendous
confession
to
make
to
you
mamma
confessions
have
to
be
tremendous
to
correspond
with
her
crimes
said
miriam
she
asked
miss
dormer
to
come
and
see
us
suggested
even
that
you
might
bring
her
some
sunday
i
do
like
the
way
mamma
does
such
things
too
much
humility
too
many
after
all
but
i
also
said
what
i
could
to
be
nice
to
her
your
sister
charming
awfully
pretty
and
modest
if
you
were
to
press
me
i
should
tell
you
frankly
that
it
seems
to
me
rather
a
social
muddle
this
rubbing
shoulders
of
girls
and
de
i
think
it
would
do
your
poor
young
things
much
good
however
it
their
own
affair
and
no
doubt
there
no
more
need
of
their
thinking
worse
than
we
are
than
of
their
thinking
we
better
the
people
they
live
with
do
seem
to
know
the
difference
i
sometimes
make
my
reflexions
about
the
public
one
works
for
ah
if
you
go
in
for
the
public
knowing
differences
you
far
too
particular
nick
laughed
as
you
affected
french
people
say
if
you
anything
at
stake
on
that
you
had
simply
better
not
play
dear
dormer
do
encourage
her
to
be
so
dreadful
for
it
dreadful
the
way
she
talks
rooth
broke
in
one
would
think
we
were
respectable
one
would
think
i
had
never
known
what
i
known
and
been
what
i
been
what
one
would
think
beloved
mother
is
that
you
a
still
greater
humbug
than
you
are
it
you
on
the
contrary
who
go
down
on
your
knees
who
pour
forth
apologies
about
our
being
vagabonds
vagabonds
listen
to
her
after
the
education
i
given
her
and
our
magnificent
prospects
wailed
rooth
sinking
with
clasped
hands
upon
the
nearest
ottoman
not
after
our
prospects
if
prospects
they
be
a
good
deal
before
them
yes
you
taught
me
tongues
and
i
greatly
obliged
to
you
they
no
doubt
give
variety
as
well
as
incoherency
to
my
conversation
and
that
of
people
in
our
line
is
for
the
most
part
notoriously
monotonous
and
shoppy
the
gift
of
tongues
is
in
general
the
sign
of
your
true
adventurer
dear
mamma
i
no
low
standard
that
the
last
thing
miriam
went
on
my
weakness
is
my
exalted
conception
of
respectability
ah
de
and
of
the
way
i
understand
it
if
i
were
to
go
in
for
being
respectable
you
see
something
fine
i
awfully
conservative
and
i
know
what
respectability
is
even
when
i
meet
people
of
society
on
the
accidental
middle
ground
of
either
glowering
or
smirking
i
know
also
what
it
is
it
is
the
sweet
union
of
little
girls
do
they
call
them
and
painted
i
should
carry
it
much
further
than
any
of
these
people
i
should
never
look
at
the
likes
of
us
every
hour
i
live
i
see
that
the
wisdom
of
the
ages
was
in
the
experience
of
dear
old
madame
carré
was
in
a
hundred
things
she
told
me
she
founded
on
a
rock
after
that
miriam
went
on
to
her
host
i
can
assure
you
that
if
you
were
so
good
as
to
bring
miss
dormer
to
see
us
we
should
be
angelically
careful
of
her
and
surround
her
with
every
attention
and
precaution
the
likes
of
us
the
likes
of
us
rooth
repeated
plaintively
and
with
a
resentment
as
vain
as
a
failure
to
sneeze
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
and
i
decline
to
be
turned
upside
down
i
my
ideas
as
well
as
you
and
i
repudiate
the
charge
of
false
humility
been
through
too
many
troubles
to
be
proud
and
a
pleasant
polite
manner
was
the
rule
of
my
life
even
in
the
days
when
god
knows
i
had
everything
i
never
changed
and
if
with
god
help
i
had
a
civil
tongue
then
i
a
civil
tongue
now
it
more
than
you
always
have
my
poor
perverse
passionate
child
once
a
lady
always
a
lady
all
the
footlights
in
the
world
turn
them
up
as
high
as
you
will
make
no
difference
there
and
i
think
people
know
it
people
who
know
anything
if
i
may
use
such
an
expression
and
it
because
they
know
it
that
i
not
afraid
to
address
them
in
a
pleasant
way
so
i
must
say
and
i
call
dormer
to
witness
for
if
he
could
reason
with
you
a
bit
about
it
he
might
render
several
people
a
service
your
conduct
to
sherringham
simply
breaks
my
heart
rooth
concluded
taking
a
jump
of
several
steps
in
the
fine
modern
avenue
of
her
argument
nick
was
appealed
to
but
he
hung
back
drawing
with
a
free
hand
and
while
he
forbore
miriam
took
it
up
mother
good
mother
very
good
but
it
only
little
by
little
that
you
discover
how
good
she
is
this
seemed
to
leave
him
at
ease
to
ask
their
companion
with
the
preliminary
intimation
that
what
she
had
just
said
was
very
striking
what
she
meant
by
her
daughter
conduct
to
old
peter
before
rooth
could
answer
this
question
however
miriam
broke
across
with
one
of
her
own
do
you
mind
telling
me
if
you
made
your
sister
go
off
with
sherringham
because
you
knew
it
was
about
time
for
me
to
turn
up
poor
dormer
i
get
you
into
trouble
do
i
she
added
quite
with
tenderness
into
trouble
echoed
nick
looking
at
her
head
but
not
at
her
eyes
well
we
wo
talk
about
that
she
returned
with
a
rich
laugh
he
now
hastened
to
say
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
leaving
the
studio
she
had
only
come
as
it
happened
for
a
moment
she
had
walked
away
with
peter
sherringham
because
they
were
cousins
and
old
friends
he
was
to
leave
england
immediately
for
a
long
time
and
he
had
offered
her
his
company
going
home
rooth
shook
her
head
very
knowingly
over
the
long
time
sherringham
would
be
absent
she
plainly
had
her
ideas
about
that
and
she
conscientiously
related
that
in
the
course
of
the
short
conversation
they
had
all
had
at
the
door
of
the
house
her
daughter
had
reminded
miss
dormer
of
something
that
had
passed
between
them
in
paris
on
the
question
of
the
charming
young
lady
modelling
her
head
i
did
it
to
make
the
idea
of
our
meeting
less
absurd
to
put
it
on
the
footing
of
our
both
being
artists
i
do
ask
you
if
she
has
talent
said
miriam
then
i
need
tell
you
laughed
nick
i
sure
she
has
talent
and
a
very
refined
inspiration
i
see
something
in
that
corner
covered
with
a
mysterious
veil
rooth
insinuated
which
led
miriam
to
go
on
immediately
has
she
been
trying
her
hand
at
mr
sherringham
when
should
she
try
her
hand
poor
dear
young
lady
he
always
sitting
with
us
said
rooth
dear
mamma
you
exaggerate
he
has
his
moments
when
he
seems
to
say
his
prayers
to
me
but
we
had
some
success
in
cutting
them
down
bien
détaché
ces
and
i
very
happy
for
him
of
course
it
an
impertinent
allusion
for
me
to
make
but
i
should
be
so
delighted
if
i
could
think
of
him
as
a
little
in
love
with
miss
dormer
the
girl
pursued
addressing
nick
he
is
i
think
just
a
little
just
a
tiny
bit
her
artist
allowed
working
away
while
rooth
ejaculated
to
her
daughter
simultaneously
how
can
you
ask
such
fantastic
questions
when
you
know
he
dying
for
oh
dying
he
dying
very
hard
cried
miriam
sherringham
a
man
of
whom
i
ca
speak
with
too
much
esteem
and
affection
and
who
may
be
destined
to
perish
by
some
horrid
fever
which
god
forbid
in
the
unpleasant
country
he
going
to
but
he
wo
have
caught
his
fever
from
your
humble
servant
you
may
kill
him
even
while
you
remain
in
perfect
health
yourself
said
nick
and
since
we
talking
of
the
matter
i
do
see
the
harm
of
my
confessing
that
he
strikes
me
as
far
gone
oh
as
very
bad
indeed
and
yet
he
in
love
with
your
sister
suis
he
tries
to
be
for
he
sees
that
as
regards
you
there
are
difficulties
he
like
to
put
his
hand
on
some
nice
girl
who
be
an
antidote
to
his
poison
difficulties
are
a
mild
name
for
them
poison
even
is
a
mild
name
for
the
ill
he
suffers
from
the
principal
difficulty
is
that
he
know
what
the
devil
he
wants
the
next
is
that
i
do
either
or
what
the
devil
i
want
myself
i
only
know
what
i
do
want
miriam
kept
on
brightly
and
as
if
uttering
some
happy
beneficent
truth
i
do
want
a
person
who
takes
things
even
less
simply
than
i
do
myself
sherringham
poor
man
must
be
very
uncomfortable
for
one
side
of
in
a
perpetual
row
with
the
other
side
he
trying
to
serve
god
and
mammon
and
i
do
know
how
god
will
come
off
what
i
like
in
you
is
that
you
definitely
let
mammon
go
it
the
only
decent
way
my
earnest
conviction
and
yet
they
call
us
people
light
dear
sherringham
has
tremendous
ambitions
tremendous
as
we
used
to
say
in
italy
he
wants
to
enjoy
every
comfort
and
to
save
every
appearance
and
all
without
making
a
scrap
of
a
sacrifice
he
expects
others
me
for
instance
to
make
all
the
sacrifices
much
as
i
esteem
him
and
much
as
i
owe
him
i
do
know
how
he
ever
came
to
stray
at
all
into
our
bold
bad
downright
bohemia
it
was
a
cruel
trick
for
fortune
to
play
him
he
ca
keep
out
of
it
he
perpetually
making
dashes
across
the
border
and
yet
as
soon
as
he
gets
here
he
on
pins
and
needles
there
another
in
whose
position
if
i
were
in
it
i
would
look
at
the
likes
of
us
i
do
know
much
about
the
matter
nick
brought
out
after
some
intent
smudging
but
i
an
idea
peter
thinks
he
has
made
or
at
least
is
making
sacrifices
so
much
the
better
you
must
encourage
him
you
must
help
him
i
do
know
what
my
daughter
talking
about
rooth
contributed
she
much
too
paradoxical
for
my
plain
mind
but
one
way
to
encourage
sherringham
there
one
way
to
help
him
and
perhaps
it
wo
be
a
worse
way
for
a
gentleman
of
your
good
nature
that
it
will
help
me
at
the
same
time
ca
i
look
to
you
dear
dormer
to
see
that
he
does
come
to
the
theatre
that
he
does
feel
himself
obliged
to
stay
away
what
danger
is
there
of
his
staying
away
nick
asked
if
he
bent
on
sacrifices
that
a
very
good
one
to
begin
with
miriam
observed
that
the
mad
bad
way
she
talks
to
him
she
has
forbidden
the
dear
unhappy
gentleman
the
house
her
mother
cried
she
brought
it
up
to
him
just
now
at
the
door
before
miss
dormer
such
very
odd
form
she
pretends
to
impose
her
commands
upon
him
oh
he
be
there
we
going
to
dine
together
said
nick
and
when
miriam
asked
him
what
that
had
to
do
with
it
he
went
on
why
arranged
it
i
going
and
he
wo
let
me
go
alone
you
going
i
sent
you
no
places
his
sitter
objected
yes
but
i
got
one
why
did
you
after
all
i
done
for
you
she
beautifully
thought
of
it
because
i
so
good
no
matter
she
added
if
sherringham
comes
i
wo
act
wo
you
act
for
me
she
act
like
an
angel
rooth
protested
she
might
do
she
might
be
anything
in
all
the
world
but
she
wo
take
common
pains
of
one
thing
there
no
doubt
said
miriam
that
compared
with
the
rest
of
us
poor
passionless
creatures
mamma
does
know
what
she
wants
and
what
that
nick
inquired
chalking
on
she
wants
everything
never
never
i
much
more
humble
retorted
the
old
woman
upon
which
her
daughter
requested
her
to
give
then
to
dormer
who
was
a
reasonable
man
and
an
excellent
judge
a
general
idea
of
the
scope
of
her
desires
as
however
rooth
sighing
and
deprecating
was
not
quick
to
acquit
herself
the
girl
tried
a
short
cut
to
the
truth
with
the
abrupt
demand
do
you
believe
for
a
single
moment
he
marry
me
why
he
has
proposed
to
you
you
told
me
yourself
a
dozen
times
proposed
what
to
me
miriam
rang
out
i
told
you
neither
a
dozen
times
nor
once
because
i
never
understood
he
has
made
wonderful
speeches
but
has
never
been
serious
you
told
me
he
had
been
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
devotion
especially
that
night
we
went
to
the
foyer
of
the
français
rooth
insisted
do
you
call
the
seventh
heaven
of
devotion
serious
he
in
love
with
me
le
veux
he
so
poisoned
dormer
vividly
puts
it
as
to
require
a
strong
antidote
but
he
has
never
spoken
to
me
as
if
he
really
expected
me
to
listen
to
him
and
he
the
more
of
a
gentleman
from
that
fact
he
knows
we
have
a
square
foot
of
common
ground
that
a
grasshopper
ca
set
up
a
house
with
a
fish
so
he
has
taken
care
to
say
to
me
only
more
than
he
can
possibly
mean
that
makes
it
stand
just
for
nothing
did
he
say
more
than
he
can
possibly
mean
when
he
took
formal
leave
of
you
yesterday
for
ever
and
ever
the
old
woman
cried
on
which
nick
her
and
do
you
call
that
his
taking
formal
leave
a
sacrifice
oh
he
took
it
all
back
his
sacrifice
before
he
left
the
house
then
has
that
no
meaning
demanded
rooth
none
that
i
can
make
out
said
her
daughter
ah
i
no
patience
with
you
you
can
be
stupid
when
you
will
you
can
be
even
that
too
the
poor
lady
groaned
what
mamma
wishes
me
to
understand
and
to
practise
is
the
particular
way
to
be
artful
with
sherringham
said
miriam
there
are
doubtless
depths
of
wisdom
and
virtue
in
it
but
i
see
only
one
art
that
of
being
perfectly
honest
i
like
to
hear
you
talk
it
makes
you
live
brings
you
out
nick
contentedly
dropped
and
you
sit
beautifully
still
all
i
want
to
say
is
please
continue
to
do
so
remain
exactly
as
you
are
it
rather
important
for
the
next
ten
minutes
we
washing
our
dirty
linen
before
you
but
it
all
right
the
girl
returned
because
it
shows
you
what
sort
of
people
we
are
and
what
you
need
to
know
do
make
me
vague
and
arranged
and
fine
in
this
new
view
she
continued
make
me
characteristic
and
real
make
life
with
all
its
horrid
facts
and
truths
stick
out
of
me
i
wish
you
could
put
mother
in
too
make
us
live
there
side
by
side
and
tell
our
little
story
wonderful
actress
and
her
still
more
wonderful
mamma
you
think
that
an
awfully
good
subject
rooth
at
this
cried
shame
on
her
daughter
wanton
humour
professing
that
she
herself
would
never
accept
so
much
from
nick
good
nature
and
miriam
settled
it
that
at
any
rate
he
was
some
day
and
in
some
way
to
do
her
mother
do
her
and
so
make
her
as
one
of
the
funniest
persons
that
ever
was
live
on
through
the
ages
she
does
believe
sherringham
wants
to
marry
me
any
more
than
you
do
the
girl
taking
up
her
dispute
again
after
a
moment
represented
to
nick
but
she
believes
how
indeed
can
i
tell
you
what
she
believes
that
i
can
work
it
so
well
if
you
understand
that
in
the
fulness
of
time
i
shall
hold
him
in
a
vice
i
to
keep
him
along
for
the
present
but
not
to
listen
to
him
for
if
i
listen
to
him
i
shall
lose
him
it
ingenious
it
complicated
but
i
daresay
you
follow
me
do
move
do
move
said
nick
pardon
a
poor
clumsy
beginner
no
i
shall
explain
quietly
somehow
here
it
complicated
and
you
must
lose
the
thread
i
shall
be
an
actress
and
make
a
tremendous
lot
of
money
and
somehow
too
i
suppose
a
little
later
i
shall
become
an
ambassadress
and
be
the
favourite
of
courts
so
you
see
it
will
all
be
delightful
only
i
shall
have
to
go
very
straight
mamma
reminds
me
of
a
story
i
once
heard
about
the
mother
of
a
young
lady
who
was
in
receipt
of
much
civility
from
the
pretender
to
a
crown
which
indeed
he
and
the
young
lady
too
afterwards
more
or
less
wore
the
old
countess
watched
the
course
of
events
and
gave
her
daughter
the
cleverest
advice
bon
ma
and
you
shall
sit
upon
a
throne
mamma
wishes
me
to
she
apparently
thinks
there
a
danger
i
may
so
that
if
i
do
sit
upon
a
throne
i
shall
at
least
parade
at
the
foot
of
one
and
if
before
that
for
ten
years
i
pile
up
the
money
forgive
me
the
way
i
made
it
i
should
hope
so
if
i
only
ten
years
is
a
good
while
to
hold
out
is
it
if
it
is
sherringham
it
will
be
some
one
else
sherringham
has
the
great
merit
of
being
a
bird
in
the
hand
i
to
keep
him
along
i
to
be
still
more
diplomatic
than
even
he
can
be
rooth
listened
to
her
daughter
with
an
air
of
assumed
reprobation
which
melted
before
the
girl
had
done
into
a
diverted
complacent
smile
the
gratification
of
finding
herself
the
proprietress
of
so
much
wit
and
irony
and
grace
miriam
account
of
her
mother
views
was
a
scene
of
comedy
and
there
was
instinctive
art
in
the
way
she
added
touch
to
touch
and
made
point
upon
point
she
was
so
quiet
to
oblige
her
painter
that
only
her
fine
lips
moved
all
her
expression
was
in
their
charming
utterance
rooth
after
the
first
flutter
of
a
less
cynical
spirit
consented
to
be
sacrificed
to
an
effect
of
the
really
high
order
she
had
now
been
educated
to
recognise
so
that
she
scarce
hesitated
when
miriam
had
ceased
speaking
before
she
tittered
out
with
the
fondest
indulgence
and
she
seemed
to
appeal
to
their
companion
ai
she
fascinating
that
the
way
she
does
for
you
it
rather
cruel
is
it
said
miriam
to
deprive
people
of
the
luxury
of
calling
one
an
actress
as
they
call
one
a
liar
i
represent
but
i
represent
truly
sherringham
would
marry
you
there
no
question
of
ten
years
cried
rooth
with
a
comicality
of
plainness
miriam
smiled
at
nick
deprecating
his
horror
of
such
talk
is
it
droll
the
way
she
ca
get
it
out
of
her
head
then
turning
almost
coaxingly
to
the
old
woman
look
about
you
they
do
marry
us
like
that
but
they
do
se
voit
tous
les
ask
mr
dormer
oh
never
it
would
be
as
if
i
asked
him
to
give
us
a
practical
proof
i
shall
never
prove
anything
by
marrying
any
one
nick
said
for
me
that
question
over
miriam
rested
kind
eyes
on
him
dear
me
how
you
must
hate
me
and
before
he
had
time
to
reply
she
went
on
to
her
mother
people
marry
them
to
make
them
leave
the
stage
which
proves
exactly
what
i
say
ah
they
offer
them
the
finest
positions
reasoned
rooth
do
you
want
me
to
leave
it
then
oh
you
can
manage
if
you
will
the
only
managing
i
know
anything
about
is
to
do
my
work
if
i
manage
that
decently
i
shall
pull
through
but
dearest
may
our
work
not
be
of
many
sorts
i
only
know
one
said
miriam
at
this
her
mother
got
up
with
a
sigh
i
see
you
do
wish
to
drive
me
into
the
street
mamma
bewildered
there
are
so
many
paths
she
wants
to
follow
there
are
so
many
bundles
of
hay
as
i
told
you
she
wishes
to
gobble
them
all
the
girl
pursued
then
she
added
yes
go
and
take
the
carriage
take
a
turn
round
the
park
you
always
delight
in
that
and
come
back
for
me
in
an
hour
i
too
vexed
with
you
the
air
will
do
me
good
said
rooth
but
before
she
went
she
addressed
nick
i
your
assurance
that
bring
him
then
bring
peter
i
do
think
i
shall
have
to
drag
him
nick
returned
but
you
must
do
me
the
justice
to
remember
that
if
i
should
resort
to
force
i
should
do
something
that
not
particularly
in
my
interest
i
should
be
magnanimous
we
must
always
be
that
must
we
moralised
rooth
how
could
it
affect
your
interest
miriam
asked
less
abstractedly
yes
as
you
say
her
mother
mused
at
their
host
the
question
of
marriage
has
ceased
to
exist
for
you
mamma
goes
straight
at
it
laughed
the
girl
getting
up
while
nick
rubbed
his
canvas
before
answering
miriam
went
to
mamma
and
settled
her
bonnet
and
mantle
in
preparation
for
her
drive
then
stood
a
moment
with
a
filial
arm
about
her
and
as
if
waiting
for
their
explanation
this
however
when
it
came
halted
visibly
why
you
said
a
while
ago
that
if
peter
was
there
you
would
act
i
act
for
smiled
miriam
inconsequently
caressing
her
mother
it
does
matter
whom
it
for
rooth
declared
sagaciously
take
your
drive
and
relax
your
mind
said
the
girl
kissing
her
come
for
me
in
an
hour
not
later
but
not
sooner
she
went
with
her
to
the
door
bundled
her
out
closed
it
behind
her
and
came
back
to
the
position
she
had
quitted
is
the
peace
i
want
she
gratefully
cried
as
she
settled
into
it
xlv
peter
sherringham
said
so
little
during
the
performance
that
his
companion
was
struck
by
his
dumbness
especially
as
miriam
acting
seemed
to
nick
magnificent
he
held
his
breath
while
she
was
on
the
stage
she
gave
the
whole
thing
including
the
spectator
emotion
such
a
lift
she
had
not
carried
out
her
fantastic
menace
of
not
exerting
herself
and
as
rooth
had
said
it
little
mattered
for
whom
she
acted
nick
was
conscious
in
watching
her
that
she
went
through
it
all
for
herself
for
the
idea
that
possessed
her
and
that
she
rendered
with
extraordinary
breadth
she
could
open
the
door
a
part
of
the
way
to
it
and
let
it
simply
peep
in
if
it
entered
at
all
it
must
enter
in
full
procession
and
occupy
the
premises
in
state
this
was
what
had
happened
on
an
occasion
which
as
the
less
tormented
of
our
young
men
felt
in
his
stall
grew
larger
with
each
throb
of
the
responsive
house
till
by
the
time
the
play
was
half
over
it
appeared
to
stretch
out
wide
arms
to
the
future
nick
had
often
heard
more
applause
but
had
never
heard
more
attention
since
they
were
all
charmed
and
hushed
together
and
success
seemed
to
be
sitting
down
with
them
there
had
been
of
course
plenty
of
announcement
the
newspapers
had
abounded
and
the
arts
of
the
manager
had
taken
the
freest
license
but
it
was
easy
to
feel
a
fine
universal
consensus
and
to
recognise
everywhere
the
light
spring
of
hope
people
snatched
their
eyes
from
the
stage
an
instant
to
look
at
each
other
all
eager
to
hand
on
the
torch
passed
to
them
by
the
actress
over
the
footlights
it
was
a
part
of
the
impression
that
she
was
now
only
showing
to
the
full
for
this
time
she
had
verse
to
deal
with
and
she
made
it
unexpectedly
exquisite
she
was
beauty
melody
truth
she
was
passion
and
persuasion
and
tenderness
she
caught
up
the
obstreperous
play
in
soothing
entwining
arms
and
seeming
to
tread
the
air
in
the
flutter
of
her
robe
carried
it
into
the
high
places
of
poetry
of
art
of
style
and
she
had
such
tones
of
nature
such
concealments
of
art
such
effusions
of
life
that
the
whole
scene
glowed
with
the
colour
she
communicated
and
the
house
pervaded
with
rosy
fire
glowed
back
at
the
scene
nick
looked
round
in
the
intervals
he
felt
excited
and
flushed
the
night
had
turned
to
a
feast
of
fraternity
and
he
expected
to
see
people
embrace
each
other
the
crowd
the
agitation
the
triumph
the
surprise
the
signals
and
rumours
the
heated
air
his
associates
near
him
pointing
out
other
figures
who
presumably
were
celebrated
but
whom
he
had
never
heard
of
all
amused
him
and
banished
every
impulse
to
question
or
to
compare
miriam
was
as
happy
as
some
right
sensation
she
would
have
fed
the
memory
with
deep
draughts
one
of
the
things
that
amused
him
or
at
least
helped
to
fill
his
attention
was
peter
attitude
which
apparently
did
exclude
criticism
rather
indeed
mainly
implied
it
this
admirer
never
took
his
eyes
off
the
actress
but
he
made
no
remark
about
her
and
never
stirred
out
of
his
chair
nick
had
had
from
the
first
a
plan
of
going
round
to
speak
to
her
but
as
his
companion
evidently
meant
not
to
move
he
scrupled
at
being
more
forward
during
their
brief
dinner
together
they
were
determined
not
to
be
late
peter
had
been
silent
quite
recklessly
grave
but
also
his
kinsman
judged
full
of
the
wish
to
make
it
clear
he
was
calm
in
his
seat
he
was
calmer
than
ever
and
had
an
air
even
of
trying
to
suggest
that
his
attendance
preoccupied
as
he
was
with
deeper
solemnities
was
more
or
less
mechanical
the
result
of
a
conception
of
duty
a
habit
of
courtesy
when
during
a
scene
in
the
second
act
a
scene
from
which
miriam
was
absent
nick
observed
to
him
that
one
might
judge
from
his
reserve
that
he
was
pleased
he
replied
after
a
moment
i
been
looking
for
her
mistakes
and
when
nick
made
answer
to
this
that
he
certainly
would
find
them
he
said
again
in
an
odd
tone
no
i
sha
find
them
i
sha
find
them
it
might
have
seemed
that
since
the
girl
performance
was
a
dazzling
success
he
regarded
his
evening
as
rather
a
failure
after
the
third
act
nick
said
candidly
my
dear
fellow
how
can
you
sit
here
are
you
going
to
speak
to
her
to
which
peter
replied
inscrutably
lord
no
never
again
i
bade
her
yesterday
she
knows
what
i
think
of
her
form
it
very
good
but
she
carries
it
a
little
too
far
besides
she
did
want
me
to
come
and
it
therefore
more
discreet
to
keep
away
from
her
surely
it
is
an
hour
for
discretion
nick
cried
excuse
me
at
any
rate
for
five
minutes
he
went
behind
and
reappeared
only
as
the
curtain
was
rising
on
the
fourth
act
and
in
the
interval
between
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
he
went
again
for
a
shorter
time
peter
was
personally
detached
but
he
consented
to
listen
to
his
companion
vivid
account
of
the
state
of
things
on
the
stage
where
the
elation
of
victory
had
lighted
up
the
place
the
strain
was
over
the
ship
in
port
they
were
all
wiping
their
faces
and
grinning
miriam
yes
positively
was
grinning
too
and
she
had
asked
a
question
about
peter
nor
sent
him
a
message
they
were
kissing
all
round
and
dancing
for
joy
they
were
on
the
eve
worse
luck
of
a
tremendous
run
peter
groaned
irrepressibly
for
this
it
was
save
for
a
slight
sign
a
moment
later
the
only
vibration
caused
in
him
by
his
cousin
report
there
was
but
one
voice
of
regret
that
they
put
on
the
piece
earlier
as
the
end
of
the
season
would
interrupt
the
run
there
was
but
one
voice
too
about
the
fourth
act
it
was
believed
all
london
would
rush
to
see
the
fourth
act
the
crowd
about
her
was
a
dozen
deep
and
miriam
in
the
midst
of
it
all
charming
she
was
receiving
in
the
ugly
place
after
the
fashion
of
royalty
almost
as
hedged
with
the
famous
divinity
yet
with
a
smile
and
a
word
for
each
she
was
really
like
a
young
queen
on
her
accession
when
she
saw
him
nick
she
had
kissed
her
hand
to
him
over
the
heads
of
the
courtiers
artless
comment
on
this
was
that
she
had
such
pretty
manners
it
made
peter
laugh
apparently
at
his
friend
conception
of
the
manners
of
a
young
queen
rooth
with
a
dozen
shawls
on
her
arm
was
as
red
as
the
but
you
could
tell
if
miriam
were
red
or
pale
she
was
so
cleverly
finely
made
up
perhaps
a
little
too
much
dashwood
of
course
was
greatly
to
the
fore
but
you
had
to
mention
his
own
performance
to
him
he
took
it
all
handsomely
and
would
hear
of
anything
but
that
fortune
was
made
he
did
say
much
indeed
but
evidently
had
ideas
about
her
fortune
he
nodded
significant
things
and
whistled
inimitable
sounds
heuh
heuh
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
moreover
he
looked
further
ahead
than
any
one
it
was
on
coming
back
to
his
place
after
the
fourth
act
that
nick
put
in
for
his
companion
benefit
most
of
these
touches
in
his
sketch
of
the
situation
if
peter
had
continued
to
look
for
miriam
mistakes
he
had
yet
found
them
the
fourth
act
bristling
with
dangers
putting
a
premium
on
every
sort
of
cheap
effect
had
rounded
itself
without
a
flaw
sitting
there
alone
while
nick
was
away
he
had
leisure
to
meditate
on
the
wonder
of
this
on
the
art
with
which
the
girl
had
separated
passion
from
violence
filling
the
whole
place
and
never
screaming
for
it
had
often
seemed
to
him
in
london
of
old
that
the
yell
of
theatrical
emotion
rang
through
the
shrinking
night
like
the
voice
of
the
sunday
newsboy
miriam
had
never
been
more
present
to
him
than
at
this
hour
but
she
was
inextricably
transmuted
present
essentially
as
the
romantic
heroine
she
represented
his
state
of
mind
was
of
the
strangest
and
he
was
conscious
of
its
strangeness
just
as
he
was
conscious
in
his
very
person
of
a
lapse
of
resistance
which
likened
itself
absurdly
to
liberation
he
felt
weak
at
the
same
time
that
he
felt
inspired
and
he
felt
inspired
at
the
same
time
that
he
knew
or
believed
he
knew
that
his
face
was
a
blank
he
saw
things
as
a
shining
confusion
and
yet
somehow
something
monstrously
definite
kept
surging
out
of
them
miriam
was
a
beautiful
actual
fictive
impossible
young
woman
of
a
past
age
an
undiscoverable
country
who
spoke
in
blank
verse
and
overflowed
with
metaphor
who
was
exalted
and
heroic
beyond
all
human
convenience
and
who
yet
was
irresistibly
real
and
related
to
one
own
affairs
but
that
reality
was
a
part
of
her
spectator
joy
and
she
was
not
changed
back
to
the
common
by
his
perception
of
the
magnificent
trick
of
art
with
which
it
was
connected
before
his
kinsman
rejoined
him
peter
taking
a
from
his
pocket
had
written
on
it
in
pencil
a
few
words
in
a
foreign
tongue
but
as
at
that
moment
he
saw
nick
coming
in
he
immediately
put
it
out
of
view
the
last
thing
before
the
curtain
rose
on
the
fifth
act
that
young
man
mentioned
his
having
brought
a
message
from
basil
dashwood
who
hoped
they
both
on
leaving
the
theatre
would
come
to
supper
with
him
in
company
with
miriam
and
her
mother
and
several
others
he
had
prepared
a
little
informal
banquet
in
honour
of
so
famous
a
night
at
this
while
the
curtain
was
about
to
rise
peter
immediately
took
out
his
card
again
and
added
something
he
wrote
the
finest
small
hand
you
could
see
nick
asked
him
what
he
was
doing
and
he
waited
but
an
instant
it
a
word
to
say
i
ca
come
to
dashwood
oh
i
shall
go
said
nick
well
i
hope
you
enjoy
it
his
companion
replied
in
a
tone
which
came
back
to
him
afterwards
when
the
curtain
fell
on
the
last
act
the
people
stayed
standing
up
in
their
places
for
acclamation
the
applause
shook
the
house
the
recall
became
a
clamour
the
relief
from
a
long
tension
this
was
in
any
performance
a
moment
peter
detested
but
he
stood
for
an
instant
beside
nick
who
clapped
to
his
cousin
diplomatic
sense
after
the
fashion
of
a
at
the
pantomime
there
was
a
veritable
roar
while
the
curtain
drew
back
at
the
side
most
removed
from
our
pair
peter
could
see
basil
dashwood
holding
it
making
a
passage
for
the
male
juvenile
lead
who
had
miriam
in
tow
nick
redoubled
his
efforts
heard
the
plaudits
swell
saw
the
bows
of
the
leading
gentleman
who
was
hot
and
fat
saw
miriam
personally
conducted
and
closer
to
the
footlights
grow
brighter
and
bigger
and
more
swaying
and
then
became
aware
that
his
own
comrade
had
with
extreme
agility
slipped
out
of
the
stalls
nick
had
already
lost
sight
of
him
he
had
apparently
taken
but
a
minute
to
escape
from
the
house
and
wondered
at
his
quitting
him
without
a
farewell
if
he
was
to
leave
england
on
the
morrow
and
they
were
not
to
meet
at
the
hospitable
dashwood
he
wondered
even
what
peter
was
up
to
since
as
he
had
assured
him
there
was
no
question
of
his
going
round
to
miriam
he
waited
to
see
this
young
lady
reappear
three
times
dragging
dashwood
behind
her
at
the
second
with
a
friendly
arm
to
whom
in
turn
was
hooked
miss
fanny
rover
the
actress
entrusted
in
the
piece
with
the
inevitable
comic
relief
he
went
out
slowly
with
the
crowd
and
at
the
door
looked
again
for
peter
who
struck
him
as
deficient
for
once
in
finish
he
could
know
that
in
another
direction
and
while
he
was
helping
the
house
to
rise
at
its
heroine
his
kinsman
had
been
particularly
explicit
on
reaching
the
lobby
peter
had
pounced
on
a
small
boy
in
buttons
who
seemed
superfluously
connected
with
a
desolate
and
from
the
tips
of
his
toes
was
peeping
at
the
stage
through
the
glazed
hole
in
the
door
of
a
box
into
one
of
the
child
hands
he
thrust
the
card
he
had
drawn
again
from
his
waistcoat
and
into
the
other
the
largest
silver
coin
he
could
find
in
the
same
receptacle
while
he
bent
over
him
with
words
of
adjuration
words
the
little
page
tried
to
help
himself
to
apprehend
by
instantly
attempting
to
peruse
the
other
words
written
on
the
card
that
no
use
it
italian
said
peter
only
carry
it
round
to
miss
rooth
without
a
minute
delay
place
it
in
her
hand
and
she
give
you
some
object
a
bracelet
a
glove
or
a
flower
to
bring
me
back
as
a
sign
that
she
has
received
it
i
shall
be
outside
bring
me
there
what
she
gives
you
and
you
shall
have
another
shilling
only
fly
his
small
messenger
sounded
him
a
moment
with
the
sharp
face
of
london
and
still
more
of
london
infancy
and
vanished
as
swiftly
as
a
slave
of
the
arabian
nights
while
he
waited
in
the
lobby
the
audience
began
to
pour
out
and
before
the
urchin
had
come
back
to
him
he
was
clapped
on
the
shoulder
by
nick
i
glad
i
have
lost
you
but
why
did
you
stay
to
give
her
a
hand
give
her
a
hand
i
hated
it
my
dear
man
i
do
follow
you
nick
said
if
you
wo
come
to
dashwood
supper
i
fear
our
ways
do
lie
together
thank
him
very
much
say
i
to
get
up
at
an
unnatural
hour
to
this
peter
added
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
she
may
not
be
there
miss
rooth
why
it
all
her
i
waiting
for
a
word
from
her
she
may
change
her
mind
nick
showed
his
interest
for
you
what
then
have
you
proposed
i
proposed
marriage
said
peter
in
a
strange
voice
i
say
nick
broke
out
and
at
the
same
moment
peter
messenger
squeezed
through
the
press
and
stood
before
him
she
has
given
me
nothing
sir
the
boy
announced
but
she
says
i
to
say
right
nick
stare
widened
you
proposed
through
aye
and
she
accepts
on
which
turning
away
peter
bounded
into
a
hansom
he
said
something
to
the
driver
through
the
roof
and
nick
eyes
followed
the
cab
as
it
started
off
this
young
man
was
mystified
was
even
amused
especially
when
the
youth
in
buttons
planted
there
and
wondering
too
brought
forth
please
sir
he
told
me
he
give
me
a
shilling
and
he
forgot
it
oh
i
ca
pay
you
for
nick
laughed
but
he
fished
out
a
dole
though
he
was
vexed
at
the
injury
to
the
supper
xlvi
peter
meanwhile
rolled
away
through
the
summer
night
to
saint
wood
he
had
put
the
pressure
of
strong
words
on
his
young
friend
entreating
her
to
drive
home
immediately
return
there
without
any
one
without
even
her
mother
he
wished
to
see
her
alone
and
for
a
purpose
he
would
fully
and
satisfactorily
explain
could
she
trust
him
he
besought
her
to
remember
his
own
situation
and
throw
over
her
supper
throw
over
everything
he
would
wait
for
her
with
unspeakable
impatience
in
balaklava
place
he
did
so
when
he
got
there
but
it
had
taken
half
an
hour
interminable
seemed
his
lonely
vigil
in
miss
lumley
where
the
character
of
the
original
proprietress
came
out
to
him
more
than
ever
before
in
a
kind
of
afterglow
of
old
sociabilities
a
vulgar
ghostly
reference
the
numerous
candles
had
been
lighted
for
him
and
rooth
familiar
fictions
lay
about
but
his
nerves
forbade
him
the
solace
of
a
chair
and
a
book
he
walked
up
and
down
thinking
and
listening
and
as
the
long
window
the
balmy
air
permitting
stood
open
to
the
garden
he
passed
several
times
in
and
out
a
carriage
appeared
to
stop
at
the
gate
then
there
was
nothing
he
heard
the
rare
rattle
of
wheels
and
the
hum
of
london
his
impatience
was
overwrought
and
though
he
knew
this
it
persisted
it
would
have
been
no
easy
matter
for
miriam
to
break
away
from
the
flock
of
her
felicitators
still
less
simple
was
it
doubtless
for
her
to
leave
poor
dashwood
with
his
supper
on
his
hands
perhaps
she
would
bring
dashwood
with
her
bring
him
to
time
her
she
was
capable
of
playing
him
that
is
of
playing
her
majesty
new
representative
to
the
small
state
or
even
of
playing
them
both
that
trick
perhaps
the
little
wretch
in
buttons
peter
remembered
now
the
neglected
shilling
only
pretending
to
go
round
with
his
card
had
come
back
with
an
invented
answer
but
how
could
he
know
since
presumably
he
could
read
italian
that
his
answer
would
fit
the
message
peter
was
sorry
now
that
he
himself
had
not
gone
round
not
snatched
miriam
bodily
away
made
sure
of
her
and
of
what
he
wanted
of
her
when
forty
minutes
had
elapsed
he
regarded
it
as
proved
that
she
would
come
and
asking
himself
what
he
should
do
determined
to
drive
off
again
and
seize
her
at
her
comrade
feast
then
he
remembered
how
nick
had
mentioned
that
this
entertainment
was
not
to
be
held
at
the
young
actor
lodgings
but
at
some
tavern
or
restaurant
the
name
of
which
he
had
not
heeded
suddenly
however
peter
became
aware
with
joy
that
this
name
did
matter
for
there
was
something
at
the
garden
door
at
last
he
rushed
out
before
she
had
had
time
to
ring
and
saw
as
she
stepped
from
the
carriage
that
she
was
alone
now
that
she
was
there
that
he
had
this
evidence
she
had
listened
to
him
and
trusted
him
all
his
impatience
and
bitterness
gave
way
and
a
flood
of
pleading
tenderness
took
their
place
in
the
first
words
he
spoke
to
her
it
was
far
dearer
of
her
than
he
had
any
right
to
dream
but
she
was
the
best
and
kindest
creature
this
showed
it
as
well
as
the
most
wonderful
he
was
really
not
off
his
head
with
his
contradictory
ways
no
before
heaven
he
was
and
he
would
explain
he
would
make
everything
clear
everything
was
changed
she
stopped
short
in
the
little
dusky
garden
looking
at
him
in
the
light
of
the
open
window
then
she
called
back
to
the
coachman
they
had
left
the
garden
door
open
wait
for
me
mind
i
shall
want
you
again
what
the
matter
wo
you
stay
peter
asked
are
you
going
out
again
at
this
absurd
hour
i
wo
hurt
you
he
gently
urged
and
he
went
back
and
closed
the
garden
door
he
wanted
to
say
to
the
coachman
it
no
matter
please
drive
away
at
the
same
time
he
would
for
the
world
have
done
anything
offensive
to
her
i
come
because
i
thought
it
better
as
things
have
turned
out
to
do
the
thing
you
ask
me
whatever
it
may
be
she
had
already
begun
that
probably
what
you
calculated
i
would
think
eh
what
this
evening
has
been
you
seen
and
i
must
allow
that
your
hand
in
it
that
you
know
for
yourself
that
you
doubtless
felt
as
you
sat
there
but
i
confess
i
do
imagine
what
you
want
of
me
here
now
she
added
she
had
remained
standing
in
the
path
peter
felt
the
irony
of
her
now
and
how
it
made
a
fool
of
him
but
he
had
been
prepared
for
this
and
for
much
worse
he
had
begged
her
not
to
think
him
a
fool
but
in
truth
at
present
he
cared
little
if
she
did
very
likely
he
was
in
spite
of
his
plea
that
everything
was
changed
he
cared
little
even
himself
however
he
spoke
in
the
tone
of
intense
reason
and
of
the
fullest
disposition
to
satisfy
her
this
lucidity
only
took
still
more
from
the
dignity
of
his
change
of
front
his
separation
from
her
the
day
before
had
had
such
pretensions
to
being
lucid
but
the
explanation
and
the
justification
were
in
the
very
fact
the
fact
that
had
complete
possession
of
him
he
named
it
when
he
replied
to
her
i
simply
overrated
my
strength
oh
i
knew
i
knew
that
why
i
entreated
you
not
to
come
miriam
groaned
she
turned
away
lamenting
and
for
a
moment
he
thought
she
would
retreat
to
her
carriage
but
he
passed
his
hand
into
her
arm
to
draw
her
forward
and
after
an
instant
felt
her
yield
the
fact
is
we
must
have
this
thing
out
he
said
then
he
added
as
he
made
her
go
into
the
house
bending
over
her
the
failure
of
my
strength
that
was
just
the
reason
of
my
coming
she
broke
into
her
laugh
at
these
words
as
she
entered
the
and
it
made
them
sound
pompous
in
their
false
wisdom
she
flung
off
as
a
tribute
to
the
image
of
their
having
the
thing
out
a
white
shawl
that
had
been
wrapped
round
her
she
was
still
painted
and
bedizened
in
the
splendid
dress
of
her
climax
so
that
she
seemed
protected
and
alienated
by
the
character
she
had
been
acting
whatever
it
is
you
want
when
i
understand
you
be
very
brief
you
do
you
know
i
given
up
a
charming
supper
for
you
mamma
has
gone
there
i
promised
to
go
back
to
them
you
an
angel
not
to
have
let
her
come
with
you
i
sure
she
wanted
to
peter
made
reply
oh
she
all
right
but
she
nervous
then
the
girl
added
she
keep
you
away
after
all
whom
are
you
talking
about
biddy
dormer
was
as
absent
from
his
mind
as
if
she
had
never
existed
the
charming
thing
you
were
with
this
morning
is
she
so
afraid
of
obliging
me
oh
she
be
so
good
for
you
do
speak
of
that
peter
gravely
said
i
was
in
perfect
good
faith
yesterday
when
i
took
leave
of
you
i
was
i
was
but
i
ca
i
ca
you
too
unutterably
dear
to
me
oh
do
do
miriam
wailed
at
this
she
stood
before
the
fireless
with
one
of
her
hands
on
it
if
it
only
to
say
that
do
you
know
what
the
use
it
is
only
to
say
that
i
a
plan
a
perfect
plan
the
whole
thing
lies
clear
before
me
and
what
the
whole
thing
he
had
to
make
an
effort
you
say
your
mother
nervous
ah
if
you
knew
how
nervous
i
am
well
i
not
go
on
give
it
up
give
it
up
peter
stammered
give
it
up
she
fixed
him
like
a
mild
medusa
i
marry
you
if
you
renounce
and
in
return
for
the
sacrifice
you
make
for
me
i
do
more
for
you
than
ever
was
done
for
a
woman
before
renounce
after
do
you
call
that
a
plan
she
asked
those
are
old
words
and
very
foolish
ones
you
wanted
something
of
that
sort
a
year
ago
oh
i
fluttered
round
the
idea
at
that
time
we
were
talking
in
the
air
i
did
really
believe
i
could
make
you
see
it
then
and
certainly
you
did
see
it
my
own
future
moreover
was
definite
to
me
i
know
what
i
could
offer
you
but
these
last
months
have
made
a
difference
i
do
know
now
now
what
i
say
is
deliberate
it
deeply
meditated
i
simply
ca
live
without
you
and
i
hold
that
together
we
may
do
great
things
she
seemed
to
wonder
what
sort
of
things
the
things
of
my
profession
of
my
life
the
things
one
does
for
country
the
responsibility
and
the
honour
of
great
affairs
deeply
fascinating
when
one
immersed
in
them
and
more
exciting
really
put
them
even
at
that
than
the
excitements
of
the
theatre
care
for
me
only
a
little
and
you
see
what
they
are
they
take
hold
of
you
believe
me
believe
me
peter
pleaded
every
fibre
of
my
being
trembles
in
what
i
say
to
you
you
admitted
yesterday
it
would
do
she
made
answer
where
were
the
fibres
of
your
being
then
they
throbbed
in
me
even
more
than
now
and
i
was
trying
like
an
ass
not
to
feel
them
where
was
this
evening
yesterday
where
were
the
maddening
hours
i
just
spent
ah
you
the
perfection
of
perfections
and
as
i
sat
there
you
taught
me
what
i
really
want
the
perfection
of
perfections
the
girl
echoed
with
the
strangest
smile
i
need
try
to
tell
you
you
must
have
felt
with
such
rapture
what
you
are
what
you
can
do
how
can
i
give
that
up
he
piteously
went
on
how
can
my
poor
friend
i
like
your
plans
and
your
responsibilities
and
your
great
affairs
as
you
call
them
they
infantile
i
just
shown
that
i
a
perfection
of
perfections
therefore
it
just
the
moment
to
as
you
gracefully
say
oh
i
was
sure
i
was
sure
and
miriam
paused
resting
eyes
at
once
lighted
and
troubled
on
him
as
in
the
effort
to
think
of
some
arrangement
that
would
help
him
out
of
his
absurdity
i
was
sure
i
mean
that
if
you
did
come
your
poor
dear
doting
brain
would
be
quite
confused
she
presently
pursued
i
ca
be
a
muff
in
public
just
for
you
dear
me
why
do
you
like
us
so
much
like
you
i
loathe
you
le
vois
parbleu
she
lightly
returned
i
mean
why
do
you
feel
us
judge
us
understand
us
so
well
i
please
you
because
you
see
because
you
know
and
then
for
that
very
reason
of
my
pleasing
you
must
adapt
me
to
your
convenience
you
must
take
me
over
as
they
say
you
admire
me
as
an
artist
and
therefore
want
to
put
me
into
a
box
in
which
the
artist
will
breathe
her
last
ah
be
reasonable
you
must
let
her
live
let
her
live
as
if
i
could
prevent
her
living
peter
cried
with
unmistakable
conviction
even
if
i
did
wish
how
could
i
prevent
a
spirit
like
yours
from
expressing
itself
do
talk
about
my
putting
you
in
a
box
for
dearest
child
i
taking
you
out
of
one
he
all
persuasively
explained
the
artist
is
irrepressible
eternal
she
be
in
everything
you
are
and
in
everything
you
do
and
you
go
about
with
her
triumphantly
exerting
your
powers
charming
the
world
carrying
everything
before
you
miriam
colour
rose
through
all
her
artificial
surfaces
at
this
all
but
convincing
appeal
and
she
asked
whimsically
shall
you
like
that
like
my
wife
to
be
the
most
brilliant
woman
in
europe
i
think
i
can
do
with
it
are
you
afraid
of
me
not
a
bit
bravely
said
how
little
you
know
me
after
all
sighed
the
girl
i
tell
the
truth
peter
ardently
went
on
and
you
must
do
me
the
justice
to
admit
that
i
taken
the
time
to
dig
deep
into
my
feelings
i
not
an
infatuated
boy
i
lived
i
had
experience
observed
in
short
i
know
what
i
mean
and
what
i
want
it
is
a
thing
to
reason
about
it
simply
a
need
that
consumes
me
i
put
it
on
starvation
diet
but
that
no
use
really
it
no
use
miriam
the
young
man
declared
with
a
ring
that
spoke
enough
of
his
sincerity
it
is
no
question
of
my
trusting
you
it
simply
a
question
of
your
trusting
me
you
all
right
as
i
heard
you
say
yourself
frank
spontaneous
generous
you
a
magnificent
creature
just
quietly
marry
me
and
i
manage
you
me
the
girl
inflexion
was
droll
it
made
him
change
colour
i
mean
i
give
you
a
larger
life
than
the
largest
you
can
get
in
any
other
way
the
stage
is
great
no
doubt
but
the
world
greater
it
a
bigger
theatre
than
any
of
those
places
in
the
strand
we
go
in
for
realities
instead
of
fables
and
you
do
them
far
better
than
you
do
the
fables
miriam
had
listened
attentively
but
her
face
that
could
so
show
things
showed
her
despair
at
his
perverted
ingenuity
pardon
my
saying
it
after
your
delightful
tributes
to
my
worth
she
returned
in
a
moment
but
i
never
listened
to
anything
quite
so
grandly
unreal
you
think
so
well
of
me
that
humility
itself
ought
to
keep
me
silent
nevertheless
i
utter
a
few
shabby
words
of
sense
i
a
magnificent
creature
on
the
stage
well
and
good
it
what
i
want
to
be
and
it
charming
to
see
such
evidence
that
i
succeed
but
off
the
stage
woe
betide
us
both
i
should
lose
all
my
advantages
the
fact
so
patent
that
it
seems
to
me
i
very
even
to
discuss
it
with
you
are
you
on
the
stage
now
pray
ah
miriam
if
it
were
for
the
respect
i
owe
you
her
companion
wailed
if
it
were
for
that
i
should
have
come
here
to
meet
you
my
gift
is
the
thing
that
takes
you
could
there
be
a
better
proof
than
that
it
display
of
it
that
has
brought
you
to
this
unreason
it
indeed
a
misfortune
that
you
so
sensitive
to
our
poor
arts
since
they
play
such
tricks
with
your
power
to
see
things
as
they
are
without
my
share
of
them
i
should
be
a
dull
empty
woman
and
yet
that
the
fate
you
ask
me
to
face
and
insanely
pretend
ready
to
face
yourself
without
it
without
it
sherringham
cried
your
own
infinitely
worse
than
mine
i
should
like
to
see
you
without
it
for
the
fiftieth
part
of
a
second
what
i
ask
you
to
give
up
is
the
dusty
boards
of
the
and
the
flaring
footlights
but
not
the
very
essence
of
your
being
your
your
genius
is
yourself
and
it
because
it
yourself
that
i
yearn
for
you
if
it
had
been
a
thing
you
could
leave
behind
by
the
easy
dodge
of
stepping
off
the
stage
i
would
never
have
looked
at
you
a
second
time
do
talk
to
me
as
if
i
were
a
simpleton
with
your
own
false
simplifications
you
were
made
to
charm
and
console
to
represent
beauty
and
harmony
and
variety
to
miserable
human
beings
and
the
daily
life
of
man
is
the
theatre
for
that
not
a
vulgar
shop
with
a
turnstile
that
open
only
once
in
the
hours
it
verily
peter
proceeded
with
a
still
deep
heat
that
kept
down
in
a
manner
his
rising
scorn
and
exasperated
passion
please
let
me
know
the
first
time
you
without
your
face
without
your
voice
your
step
your
exquisite
spirit
the
turn
of
your
head
and
the
wonder
of
your
look
miriam
at
this
moved
away
from
him
with
a
port
that
resembled
what
she
sometimes
showed
on
the
stage
when
she
turned
her
young
back
upon
the
footlights
and
then
after
a
few
steps
grandly
swept
round
again
this
evolution
she
performed
it
was
over
in
an
instant
on
the
present
occasion
even
to
stopping
short
with
her
eyes
upon
him
and
her
head
admirably
erect
surely
it
strange
she
said
the
way
the
other
solution
never
occurs
to
you
the
other
solution
that
should
stay
on
the
stage
i
do
understand
you
her
friend
gloomed
stay
on
stage
come
off
your
own
for
a
little
he
said
nothing
then
you
mean
that
if
i
do
that
you
have
me
i
mean
that
if
it
were
to
occur
to
you
to
offer
me
a
little
sacrifice
on
your
own
side
it
might
place
the
matter
in
a
slightly
more
attractive
light
continue
to
let
you
act
as
my
wife
he
appealed
is
it
a
real
condition
am
i
to
understand
that
those
are
your
terms
i
may
say
so
without
fear
because
you
never
accept
them
would
you
accept
them
me
he
demanded
accept
the
manly
the
professional
sacrifice
see
me
throw
up
my
work
my
prospects
of
course
i
should
have
to
do
that
and
simply
become
your
appendage
she
raised
her
arms
for
a
prodigious
fall
my
dear
fellow
you
invite
me
with
the
best
conscience
in
the
world
to
become
yours
the
cases
are
not
equal
you
make
of
me
the
husband
of
an
actress
i
should
make
of
you
the
wife
of
an
ambassador
the
husband
of
an
actress
bientôt
in
that
tone
of
scorn
if
you
consistent
said
miriam
all
lucid
and
hard
it
ought
to
be
a
proud
position
for
you
what
do
you
mean
if
i
consistent
have
you
always
insisted
on
the
beauty
and
interest
of
our
art
and
the
greatness
of
our
mission
have
you
almost
come
to
blows
with
poor
gabriel
nash
about
it
what
did
all
that
mean
if
you
wo
face
the
first
consequences
of
your
theory
either
it
was
an
enlightened
conviction
or
it
was
an
empty
pretence
if
you
were
only
talking
against
time
i
glad
to
know
it
she
rolled
out
with
a
darkening
eye
the
better
the
cause
it
seems
to
me
the
better
the
deed
and
if
the
theatre
important
to
the
spirit
as
you
used
to
say
so
charmingly
and
if
into
the
bargain
you
the
pull
of
being
so
fond
of
me
i
do
see
why
it
should
be
monstrous
of
you
to
give
us
your
services
in
an
intelligent
indirect
way
of
course
if
you
not
serious
we
need
talk
at
all
but
if
you
are
with
your
conception
of
what
the
actor
can
do
why
is
it
so
base
to
come
to
the
actor
aid
taking
one
devotion
with
another
if
i
so
fine
i
worth
looking
after
a
bit
and
the
place
where
i
finest
is
the
place
to
look
after
me
he
had
a
long
pause
again
taking
her
in
as
it
seemed
to
him
he
had
never
done
you
were
never
finer
than
at
this
minute
in
the
deepest
domesticity
of
private
life
i
no
conception
whatever
of
what
the
actor
can
do
and
no
theory
whatever
about
the
importance
of
the
theatre
any
infatuation
of
that
sort
has
completely
dropped
from
me
and
for
all
i
care
the
theatre
may
go
to
the
dogs
which
i
judge
it
altogether
probably
will
you
dishonest
you
ungrateful
you
false
miriam
flashed
it
was
the
theatre
brought
you
here
if
it
had
been
for
the
theatre
i
never
would
have
looked
at
you
it
was
in
the
name
of
the
theatre
you
first
made
love
to
me
it
to
the
theatre
you
owe
every
advantage
that
so
far
as
i
concerned
you
possess
i
seem
to
possess
a
great
many
poor
peter
derisively
groaned
you
might
avail
yourself
better
of
those
you
have
you
make
me
angry
but
i
want
to
be
fair
said
the
shining
creature
and
i
ca
be
unless
you
are
you
not
fair
nor
candid
nor
honourable
when
you
swallow
your
words
and
abjure
your
faith
when
you
throw
over
old
friends
and
old
memories
for
a
selfish
purpose
purpose
is
in
your
own
convenient
idiom
peter
promptly
answered
i
suppose
you
consider
that
if
i
truly
esteemed
you
i
should
be
ashamed
to
deprive
the
world
of
the
light
of
your
genius
perhaps
my
esteem
is
of
the
right
quality
there
are
different
kinds
are
there
at
any
rate
i
explained
to
you
that
i
propose
to
deprive
the
world
of
nothing
at
all
you
shall
be
celebrated
vain
words
vain
words
my
dear
and
she
turned
off
again
in
her
impatience
i
know
of
course
she
added
quickly
that
to
befool
yourself
with
such
twaddle
you
must
be
pretty
bad
yes
i
pretty
bad
he
admitted
looking
at
her
dismally
what
do
you
do
with
the
declaration
you
made
me
the
other
day
the
day
i
found
my
cousin
here
that
you
take
me
if
i
should
come
to
you
as
one
who
had
risen
high
miriam
thought
of
it
i
remember
the
chaff
about
the
honours
the
orders
the
stars
and
garters
my
poor
foolish
friend
do
be
so
painfully
literal
do
you
know
a
joke
when
you
see
it
it
was
to
worry
your
cousin
was
it
but
it
did
in
the
least
succeed
why
should
you
wish
to
worry
my
cousin
because
he
so
provoking
she
instantly
answered
after
which
she
laughed
as
if
for
her
falling
too
simply
into
the
trap
he
had
laid
surely
at
all
events
i
had
my
freedom
no
less
than
i
have
it
now
pray
what
explanations
should
i
have
owed
you
and
in
what
fear
of
you
should
i
have
gone
however
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
say
i
did
tell
you
that
we
might
arrange
it
on
the
day
you
should
come
to
me
covered
with
glory
in
the
shape
of
little
tinkling
medals
why
should
you
anticipate
that
transaction
by
so
many
years
and
knock
me
down
such
a
long
time
in
advance
where
the
glory
please
and
where
are
the
medals
dearest
girl
am
i
not
going
to
strange
parts
a
capital
promotion
next
month
he
insistently
demanded
and
ca
you
trust
me
enough
to
believe
i
speak
with
a
real
appreciation
of
the
facts
that
i
not
lying
to
you
in
short
when
i
tell
you
i
my
foot
in
the
stirrup
the
glory
dawning
all
right
too
what
you
propose
to
me
then
is
to
accompany
you
to
your
new
post
what
you
propose
to
me
is
to
pack
up
and
start
you
put
it
in
a
nutshell
but
peter
smile
was
strained
you
touching
it
has
its
charm
but
you
ca
get
anything
in
any
of
the
americas
you
know
i
assured
there
are
no
medals
to
be
picked
up
in
those
parts
which
are
therefore
indeed
that
why
the
diplomatic
body
hate
them
all
they
on
the
way
they
on
the
way
he
could
only
feverishly
hammer
the
people
here
do
keep
us
long
in
disagreeable
places
unless
we
want
to
stay
there
one
thing
you
can
get
anywhere
if
ability
and
nowhere
if
you
not
and
in
the
disagreeable
places
generally
more
than
in
the
others
and
that
since
it
the
element
of
the
question
we
discussing
is
simply
success
it
odious
to
be
put
on
one
swagger
but
i
protest
against
being
treated
as
if
i
had
nothing
to
offer
to
offer
a
person
who
has
such
glories
of
her
own
not
a
little
presumptuous
ass
i
a
man
accomplished
and
determined
and
the
omens
are
on
my
side
peter
faltered
a
moment
and
then
with
a
queer
expression
went
on
remember
after
all
that
strictly
speaking
your
glories
are
also
still
in
the
future
an
exclamation
at
these
words
burst
from
miriam
lips
but
her
companion
resumed
quickly
ask
my
official
superiors
ask
any
of
my
colleagues
if
they
consider
nothing
to
offer
he
had
an
idea
as
he
ceased
speaking
that
she
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
out
with
some
strong
word
of
resentment
at
his
allusion
to
the
contingent
nature
of
her
prospects
but
it
only
deepened
his
wound
to
hear
her
say
with
extraordinary
mildness
it
perfectly
true
that
my
glories
are
still
to
come
that
i
may
fizzle
out
and
that
my
little
success
of
is
perhaps
a
mere
flash
in
the
pan
stranger
things
have
been
something
of
that
sort
happens
every
day
but
do
we
talk
too
much
of
that
part
of
it
she
asked
with
a
weary
patience
that
was
noble
in
its
effect
surely
it
vulgar
to
think
only
of
the
noise
one
going
to
make
especially
when
one
remembers
how
utterly
most
of
the
people
will
be
among
whom
one
makes
it
it
is
to
my
possible
glories
i
cling
it
simply
to
my
idea
even
if
it
destined
to
betray
me
and
sink
me
i
like
it
better
than
anything
else
a
thousand
times
better
i
sorry
to
have
to
put
it
in
such
a
way
than
tossing
up
my
head
as
the
fine
lady
of
a
little
coterie
a
little
coterie
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
for
this
at
least
peter
could
fight
a
big
coterie
then
it
only
that
at
the
best
a
nasty
prim
woman
who
perched
on
her
little
local
pedestal
and
thinks
she
a
queen
for
ever
because
she
ridiculous
for
an
hour
oh
you
need
tell
me
i
seen
them
abroad
the
dreariest
females
and
could
imitate
them
here
i
could
do
one
for
you
on
the
spot
if
i
were
so
tired
it
scarcely
worth
mentioning
perhaps
all
this
while
but
ready
to
drop
she
picked
up
the
white
mantle
she
had
tossed
off
flinging
it
round
her
with
her
usual
amplitude
of
gesture
waiting
for
me
and
i
confess
i
hungry
if
i
do
hurry
they
eat
up
all
the
nice
things
do
say
i
have
been
obliging
and
come
back
when
you
better
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
we
talked
too
much
about
the
vulgar
side
of
our
question
peter
returned
walking
round
to
get
between
her
and
the
french
window
by
which
she
apparently
had
a
view
of
leaving
the
room
that
because
i
wanted
to
bribe
you
bribery
almost
always
vulgar
yes
you
should
do
better
there
a
cab
some
of
them
have
come
for
me
i
must
go
she
added
listening
for
a
sound
that
reached
her
from
the
road
peter
listened
too
making
out
no
cab
believe
me
it
is
wise
to
turn
your
back
on
such
an
affection
as
mine
and
on
such
a
confidence
he
broke
out
again
speaking
almost
in
a
warning
tone
there
was
a
touch
of
superior
sternness
in
it
as
of
a
rebuke
for
real
folly
but
it
was
meant
to
be
tender
and
stopping
her
within
a
few
feet
of
the
window
such
things
are
the
most
precious
that
life
has
to
give
us
he
added
all
but
didactically
she
had
listened
once
more
for
a
little
then
she
appeared
to
give
up
the
idea
of
the
cab
the
reader
need
hardly
be
told
that
at
this
stage
of
her
youthful
history
the
right
way
for
her
lover
to
take
her
have
been
to
picture
himself
as
acting
for
her
highest
good
i
like
your
calling
the
feeling
with
which
i
inspire
you
confidence
she
presently
said
and
the
deep
note
of
the
few
words
had
something
of
the
distant
mutter
of
thunder
what
is
it
then
when
i
offer
you
everything
i
have
everything
i
am
everything
i
shall
ever
be
she
seemed
to
measure
him
as
for
the
possible
success
of
an
attempt
to
pass
him
but
she
remained
where
she
was
i
sorry
for
you
yes
but
i
also
rather
ashamed
ashamed
of
a
brave
offer
to
see
me
through
that
what
i
should
call
confidence
you
say
that
you
hate
the
theatre
and
do
you
know
what
has
made
you
do
it
the
fact
that
it
has
too
large
a
place
in
your
mind
to
let
you
disown
it
and
throw
it
over
with
a
good
conscience
it
has
a
deep
fascination
for
you
and
yet
you
not
strong
enough
to
do
so
enlightened
and
public
a
thing
as
take
up
with
it
in
my
person
ashamed
of
yourself
for
that
as
all
your
constant
high
claims
for
it
are
on
record
so
you
blaspheme
against
it
to
try
and
cover
your
retreat
and
your
treachery
and
straighten
out
your
personal
situation
but
it
wo
do
dear
sherringham
it
wo
do
at
all
miriam
proceeded
with
a
triumphant
almost
judicial
lucidity
which
made
her
companion
stare
you
have
the
smallest
excuse
of
stupidity
and
your
perversity
is
no
excuse
whatever
leave
her
alone
altogether
a
poor
girl
who
making
her
way
or
else
come
frankly
to
help
her
to
give
her
the
benefit
of
your
wisdom
do
lock
her
up
for
life
under
the
pretence
of
doing
her
good
what
does
one
most
good
is
to
see
a
little
honesty
you
the
best
judge
the
best
critic
the
best
observer
the
best
that
i
ever
come
across
you
committed
to
it
by
everything
you
said
to
me
for
a
twelvemonth
by
the
whole
turn
of
your
mind
by
the
way
you
followed
us
up
all
of
us
from
far
back
if
an
art
noble
and
beneficent
one
should
be
afraid
to
offer
it
one
arm
your
cousin
is
he
can
make
sacrifices
my
cousin
peter
amazedly
echoed
why
was
it
only
the
other
day
you
were
throwing
his
sacrifices
in
his
teeth
under
this
imputation
on
her
straightness
miriam
flinched
but
for
an
instant
i
did
that
to
worry
she
smiled
why
should
you
wish
to
worry
me
if
you
care
so
little
about
me
care
little
about
you
have
i
told
you
often
did
i
tell
you
yesterday
how
much
i
care
ai
i
showing
it
now
by
spending
half
the
night
here
with
you
giving
myself
away
to
all
those
cynics
taking
all
this
trouble
to
persuade
you
to
hold
up
your
head
and
have
the
courage
of
your
opinions
you
invent
my
opinions
for
your
convenience
said
peter
all
undaunted
as
long
ago
as
the
night
i
introduced
you
in
paris
to
mademoiselle
voisin
you
accused
me
of
looking
down
on
those
who
practise
your
art
i
remember
how
you
came
down
on
me
because
i
did
take
your
friend
dashwood
seriously
enough
perhaps
i
did
but
if
already
at
that
time
i
was
so
wide
of
the
mark
you
can
scarcely
accuse
me
of
treachery
now
i
do
remember
but
i
daresay
you
right
miriam
coldly
meditated
what
i
accused
you
of
then
was
probably
simply
what
i
reproach
you
with
now
the
germ
at
least
of
your
deplorable
weakness
you
consider
that
we
do
awfully
valuable
work
and
yet
you
would
for
the
world
let
people
suppose
you
really
take
our
side
if
your
position
was
even
at
that
time
so
false
so
much
the
worse
for
you
that
all
oh
it
refreshing
his
formidable
friend
exclaimed
after
a
pause
during
which
peter
seemed
to
himself
to
taste
the
full
bitterness
of
despair
so
baffled
and
cheapened
he
intimately
felt
oh
it
refreshing
to
see
a
man
burn
his
ships
in
a
cause
that
appeals
to
him
give
up
something
precious
for
it
and
break
with
horrid
timidities
and
snobberies
it
the
most
beautiful
sight
in
the
world
poor
peter
sore
as
he
was
and
with
the
cold
breath
of
failure
in
his
face
nevertheless
burst
out
laughing
at
this
fine
irony
magnificent
you
give
me
at
this
moment
the
finest
possible
illustration
of
what
you
mean
by
burning
one
ships
verily
verily
there
no
one
like
you
talk
of
timidity
talk
of
refreshment
if
i
had
any
talent
for
it
i
go
on
the
stage
so
as
to
spend
my
life
with
you
the
better
if
you
do
that
i
be
your
wife
the
day
after
your
first
appearance
that
would
be
really
respectable
miriam
said
unfortunately
i
no
talent
that
would
only
make
it
the
more
respectable
you
just
like
poor
nick
peter
returned
you
taken
to
imitating
gabriel
nash
do
you
see
that
it
only
if
it
were
a
question
of
my
going
on
the
stage
myself
that
there
would
be
a
certain
fitness
in
your
contrasting
me
invidiously
with
nick
and
in
my
giving
up
one
career
for
another
but
simply
to
stand
in
the
wing
and
hold
your
shawl
and
your
he
concluded
mournfully
as
if
he
had
ceased
to
debate
holding
my
shawl
and
my
is
a
mere
detail
representing
a
very
small
part
of
the
whole
precious
service
the
protection
and
encouragement
for
which
a
woman
in
my
position
might
be
indebted
to
a
man
interested
in
her
work
and
as
accomplished
and
determined
as
you
very
justly
describe
yourself
and
would
it
be
your
idea
that
such
a
man
should
live
on
the
money
earned
by
an
exhibition
of
the
person
of
his
still
more
accomplished
and
still
more
determined
wife
why
not
if
they
work
together
if
there
something
of
his
spirit
and
his
support
in
everything
she
does
miriam
demanded
vous
with
the
famous
of
course
that
the
great
stick
they
beat
us
with
yes
we
show
it
for
money
those
of
us
who
have
anything
decent
to
show
and
some
no
doubt
who
have
which
is
the
real
scandal
what
will
you
have
it
only
the
envelope
of
the
idea
it
only
our
machinery
which
ought
to
be
conceded
to
us
and
in
proportion
as
the
idea
takes
hold
of
us
do
we
become
unconscious
of
the
clumsy
body
poor
old
if
you
knew
what
think
of
it
if
you
do
forget
it
that
your
own
affair
it
shows
you
dense
before
the
idea
that
dense
and
peter
appealed
to
their
lamplit
solitude
the
favouring
intimate
night
that
only
witnessed
his
defeat
as
if
this
outrage
had
been
all
that
was
wanting
i
mean
the
public
is
the
public
who
pays
us
after
all
they
expect
us
to
look
at
too
who
are
not
half
so
well
worth
it
if
you
should
see
some
of
the
creatures
who
have
the
face
to
plant
themselves
there
in
the
stalls
before
one
for
three
mortal
hours
i
daresay
it
would
be
simpler
to
have
no
bodies
but
we
all
in
the
same
box
and
it
would
be
a
great
injustice
to
the
idea
and
we
all
showing
ourselves
all
the
while
only
some
of
us
are
not
worth
paying
you
extraordinarily
droll
but
somehow
i
ca
laugh
at
you
he
said
his
handsome
face
drawn
by
his
pain
to
a
contraction
sufficiently
attesting
the
fact
do
you
remember
the
second
time
i
ever
saw
you
the
day
you
recited
at
my
place
he
abruptly
asked
a
good
deal
as
if
he
were
taking
from
his
quiver
an
arrow
which
if
it
was
the
last
was
also
one
of
the
sharpest
perfectly
and
what
an
idiot
i
was
though
it
was
only
yesterday
you
expressed
to
me
then
a
deep
detestation
of
the
sort
of
to
which
the
profession
you
were
taking
up
would
commit
you
if
you
compared
yourself
to
a
contortionist
at
a
country
fair
only
taking
my
cue
from
you
i
do
know
what
i
may
have
said
then
replied
miriam
whose
steady
flight
was
not
arrested
by
this
ineffectual
bolt
i
was
no
doubt
already
wonderful
for
talking
of
things
i
know
nothing
about
i
was
only
on
the
brink
of
the
stream
and
i
perhaps
thought
the
water
colder
than
it
is
one
warms
it
a
bit
one
self
when
once
one
in
of
course
i
a
contortionist
and
of
course
there
a
hateful
side
but
do
you
see
how
that
very
fact
puts
a
price
on
every
compensation
on
the
help
of
those
who
are
ready
to
insist
on
the
side
the
grand
one
and
especially
on
the
sympathy
of
the
person
who
ready
to
insist
most
and
to
keep
before
us
the
great
thing
the
element
that
makes
up
for
everything
the
element
peter
questioned
with
a
vagueness
that
was
pardonably
exaggerated
do
you
mean
your
success
i
mean
what
you
so
often
been
eloquent
about
she
returned
with
an
indulgent
shrug
the
way
we
simply
stir
people
souls
ah
where
life
can
help
us
she
broke
out
with
a
change
of
tone
where
human
relations
and
affections
can
help
us
love
and
faith
and
joy
and
suffering
and
experience
i
do
know
what
to
call
they
suggest
things
they
light
them
up
and
sanctify
them
as
you
may
say
they
make
them
appear
worth
doing
she
became
radiant
a
while
as
if
with
a
splendid
vision
then
melting
into
still
another
accent
which
seemed
all
nature
and
harmony
and
charity
she
proceeded
i
must
tell
you
that
in
the
matter
of
what
we
can
do
for
each
other
i
have
a
tremendously
high
ideal
i
go
in
for
closeness
of
union
for
identity
of
interest
a
true
marriage
as
they
call
it
must
do
one
a
lot
of
good
he
stood
there
looking
at
her
for
a
time
during
which
her
eyes
sustained
his
penetration
without
a
relenting
gleam
some
lapse
of
cruelty
or
of
paradox
but
with
a
passionate
inarticulate
sound
he
turned
away
to
remain
on
the
edge
of
the
window
his
hands
in
his
pockets
gazing
defeatedly
doggedly
into
the
featureless
night
into
the
little
black
garden
which
had
nothing
to
give
him
but
a
familiar
smell
of
damp
the
warm
darkness
had
no
relief
for
him
and
histrionic
hardness
flung
him
back
against
a
world
against
a
bedimmed
nature
which
had
no
consolation
the
bleared
irresponsive
eyes
of
the
london
firmament
for
the
brief
space
of
his
glaring
at
these
things
he
dumbly
and
helplessly
raged
what
he
wanted
was
something
that
was
not
in
thick
prospect
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
sudden
offensive
importunity
of
art
this
senseless
mocking
catch
like
some
irritating
chorus
of
conspirators
in
a
bad
opera
in
which
her
voice
was
so
incongruously
conjoined
with
nick
and
in
which
biddy
sweet
little
pipe
had
not
scrupled
still
more
bewilderingly
to
mingle
art
might
yield
to
damnation
what
commission
after
all
had
he
ever
given
it
to
better
him
or
bother
him
if
the
pointless
groan
in
which
peter
exhaled
a
part
of
his
humiliation
had
been
translated
into
words
these
words
would
have
been
as
heavily
charged
with
a
genuine
british
mistrust
of
the
uncanny
principle
as
if
the
poor
fellow
speaking
them
had
never
quitted
his
island
several
acquired
perceptions
had
struck
a
deep
root
in
him
but
an
immemorial
compact
formation
lay
deeper
still
he
tried
at
the
present
hour
to
rest
on
it
spiritually
but
found
it
inelastic
and
at
the
very
moment
when
most
conscious
of
this
absence
of
the
rebound
or
of
any
tolerable
ease
he
felt
his
vision
solicited
by
an
object
which
as
he
immediately
guessed
could
only
add
to
the
complication
of
things
an
undefined
shape
hovered
before
him
in
the
garden
halfway
between
the
gate
and
the
house
it
remained
outside
of
the
broad
shaft
of
lamplight
projected
from
the
window
it
wavered
for
a
moment
after
it
had
become
aware
of
his
observation
and
then
whisked
round
the
corner
of
the
lodge
this
characteristic
movement
so
effectually
dispelled
the
mystery
it
could
only
be
rooth
who
resorted
to
such
conspicuous
secrecies
that
to
feel
the
game
up
and
his
interview
over
he
had
no
need
to
see
the
figure
reappear
on
second
thoughts
and
dodge
about
in
the
dusk
with
a
sportive
vexatious
vagueness
evidently
warning
of
a
few
minutes
before
had
been
founded
a
cab
had
deposited
her
anxious
mother
at
the
garden
door
rooth
had
entered
with
precautions
she
had
approached
the
house
and
retreated
she
had
effaced
herself
had
peered
and
waited
and
listened
maternal
solicitude
and
muddled
calculations
had
drawn
her
from
a
feast
as
yet
too
imperfectly
commemorative
the
heroine
of
the
occasion
of
course
had
been
intolerably
missed
so
that
the
old
woman
had
both
obliged
the
company
and
quieted
her
own
nerves
by
jumping
insistently
into
a
hansom
and
rattling
up
to
saint
john
wood
to
reclaim
the
absentee
but
if
she
had
wished
to
be
in
time
she
had
also
desired
not
to
be
impertinent
and
would
have
been
still
more
embarrassed
to
say
what
she
aspired
to
promote
than
to
phrase
what
she
had
proposed
to
hinder
she
wanted
to
abstain
tastefully
to
interfere
felicitously
and
more
generally
and
justifiably
the
small
hours
having
come
to
see
what
her
young
charges
were
up
to
she
would
probably
have
gathered
that
they
were
quarrelling
and
she
appeared
now
to
be
motioning
to
peter
to
know
if
it
were
over
he
took
no
notice
of
her
signals
if
signals
they
were
he
only
felt
that
before
he
made
way
for
the
poor
odious
lady
there
was
one
small
spark
he
might
strike
from
miriam
flint
without
letting
her
guess
that
her
mother
was
on
the
premises
he
turned
again
to
his
companion
she
would
have
taken
her
chance
to
regard
their
discussion
as
more
than
terminated
and
by
the
other
egress
flit
away
from
him
in
silence
but
she
was
still
there
she
was
in
the
act
of
approaching
him
with
a
manifest
intention
of
kindness
and
she
looked
indeed
to
his
surprise
like
an
angel
of
mercy
do
let
us
part
so
harshly
she
said
with
your
trying
to
make
me
feel
as
if
i
were
merely
disobliging
it
no
use
talking
we
only
hurt
each
other
let
us
hold
our
tongues
like
decent
people
and
go
about
our
business
it
is
as
if
you
had
any
cure
when
you
such
a
capital
one
try
it
try
it
my
dear
friend
you
see
i
wish
you
the
highest
promotion
and
the
quickest
every
success
and
every
reward
when
got
them
all
some
day
and
i
become
a
great
swell
too
we
meet
on
that
solid
basis
and
you
be
glad
i
been
dreadful
now
surely
before
i
leave
you
i
a
right
to
ask
you
this
he
answered
holding
fast
in
both
his
own
the
cool
hand
of
farewell
she
had
chosen
finally
to
torment
him
with
are
you
ready
to
follow
up
by
a
definite
promise
your
implied
assurance
that
i
a
remedy
a
definite
promise
miriam
benignly
gazed
it
was
the
perfection
of
indirectness
i
do
that
you
a
remedy
i
declare
it
on
the
that
delightful
girl
i
not
talking
of
any
delightful
girl
but
you
he
broke
in
with
a
voice
that
as
he
afterwards
learned
struck
rooth
ears
in
the
garden
with
affright
i
simply
hold
you
under
pain
of
being
convicted
of
the
grossest
prevarication
to
the
strict
sense
of
what
you
said
ten
minutes
ago
ah
i
said
so
many
things
one
has
to
do
that
to
get
rid
of
you
you
rather
hurt
my
hand
she
added
and
jerked
it
away
in
a
manner
showing
that
if
she
was
an
angel
of
mercy
her
mercy
was
partly
for
herself
as
i
understand
you
then
i
may
have
some
hope
if
i
do
renounce
my
profession
peter
pursued
if
i
break
with
everything
my
prospects
my
studies
my
training
my
emoluments
my
past
and
my
future
the
service
of
my
country
and
the
ambition
of
my
life
and
engage
to
take
up
instead
the
business
of
watching
your
interests
so
far
as
i
may
learn
how
and
ministering
to
your
triumphs
so
far
as
may
in
me
lie
if
after
further
reflexion
i
decide
to
go
through
these
preliminaries
have
i
your
word
that
i
may
definitely
look
to
you
to
reward
me
with
your
precious
hand
i
do
think
you
any
right
to
put
the
question
to
me
now
she
returned
with
a
promptitude
partly
produced
perhaps
by
the
form
his
solemn
speech
had
given
there
was
a
charm
in
the
sound
of
it
to
each
item
of
his
enumeration
the
case
is
so
very
contingent
so
dependent
on
what
you
ingeniously
call
your
further
reflexion
while
you
really
reserve
everything
you
ask
me
to
commit
myself
if
it
a
question
of
further
reflexion
why
did
you
drag
me
up
here
and
then
she
added
i
so
far
from
wishing
you
to
take
any
such
monstrous
step
monstrous
you
call
it
just
now
you
said
it
would
be
sublime
sublime
if
it
done
with
spontaneity
with
passion
ridiculous
if
done
further
reflexion
as
you
said
perfectly
a
while
ago
it
is
a
thing
to
reason
about
ah
what
a
help
you
be
to
me
in
diplomacy
peter
yearningly
cried
will
you
give
me
a
year
to
consider
would
you
trust
for
a
year
why
not
if
i
ready
to
trust
you
for
life
oh
i
should
be
free
then
worse
luck
and
how
much
you
seem
to
take
for
granted
one
must
like
you
remember
he
could
immediately
say
that
you
made
a
great
point
of
your
liking
me
would
you
do
so
still
more
if
i
were
heroic
she
showed
him
for
all
her
high
impatience
now
the
interest
of
a
long
look
i
think
i
should
pity
you
in
such
a
cause
give
it
all
to
do
throw
away
a
real
happiness
ah
you
ca
back
out
of
your
position
with
a
few
vague
and
even
rather
impertinent
words
peter
protested
you
accuse
me
of
swallowing
my
opinions
but
you
swallow
your
pledges
you
painted
in
heavenly
colours
the
sacrifice
i
talking
of
and
now
you
must
take
the
consequences
the
consequences
why
my
coming
back
in
a
year
to
square
you
ah
you
a
bore
she
let
him
have
it
at
last
come
back
when
you
like
i
do
wonder
you
grown
desperate
but
fancy
then
she
added
as
she
looked
past
him
at
a
new
interlocutor
yes
but
if
he
square
you
peter
heard
rooth
voice
respond
all
persuasively
behind
him
she
had
stolen
up
to
the
window
now
had
passed
the
threshold
was
in
the
room
but
her
daughter
had
not
been
startled
what
is
it
he
wants
to
do
dear
she
continued
to
miriam
to
induce
me
to
marry
him
if
he
go
upon
the
stage
he
practise
over
there
where
he
going
and
then
come
back
and
appear
is
it
too
dreadful
talk
him
out
of
it
stay
with
him
soothe
him
the
girl
hurried
on
you
find
some
drinks
and
some
biscuits
in
the
cupboard
keep
him
with
you
pacify
him
give
him
little
supper
meanwhile
i
go
to
mine
i
take
the
brougham
do
follow
with
which
words
miriam
bounded
into
the
garden
her
white
drapery
shining
for
an
instant
in
the
darkness
before
she
disappeared
peter
looked
about
him
to
pick
up
his
hat
but
while
he
did
so
heard
the
bang
of
the
gate
and
the
quick
carriage
get
into
motion
rooth
appeared
to
sway
violently
and
in
opposed
directions
that
of
the
impulse
to
rush
after
miriam
and
that
of
the
extraordinary
possibility
to
which
the
young
lady
had
alluded
she
was
in
doubt
yet
at
a
venture
detaining
him
with
a
maternal
touch
she
twinkled
up
at
their
visitor
like
an
insinuating
i
so
glad
you
came
i
not
i
got
nothing
by
it
peter
said
as
he
found
his
hat
oh
it
was
so
beautiful
she
declared
the
play
yes
wonderful
i
afraid
it
too
late
for
me
to
avail
myself
of
the
privilege
your
daughter
offers
me
ah
it
a
pity
wo
you
take
asked
rooth
when
i
heard
your
voice
so
high
i
was
scared
and
hung
back
but
before
he
could
reply
she
added
are
you
really
thinking
of
the
stage
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
do
you
mean
you
proposed
oh
unmistakably
and
what
does
she
say
why
you
heard
she
says
i
an
ass
ah
the
little
wretch
laughed
rooth
leave
her
to
me
i
help
you
but
you
are
mad
give
up
nothing
least
of
all
your
advantages
i
wo
give
up
your
daughter
said
peter
reflecting
that
if
this
was
cheap
it
was
at
any
rate
good
enough
for
rooth
he
mended
it
a
little
indeed
by
adding
darkly
but
you
ca
make
her
take
me
i
can
prevent
her
taking
any
one
else
oh
you
peter
cried
with
more
scepticism
than
ceremony
you
see
you
see
he
passed
into
the
garden
but
after
she
had
blown
out
the
candles
and
drawn
the
window
to
rooth
went
with
him
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
be
yourself
to
be
true
to
your
fine
position
she
explained
as
they
proceeded
trust
me
with
the
rest
trust
me
and
be
quiet
how
can
one
be
quiet
after
this
magnificent
evening
yes
but
it
just
that
panted
the
eager
old
woman
it
has
launched
her
so
on
this
sea
of
dangers
that
to
make
up
for
the
loss
of
the
old
security
do
you
know
we
must
take
a
still
firmer
hold
aye
of
what
peter
asked
as
rooth
comfort
became
vague
while
she
stopped
with
him
at
the
garden
door
ah
you
know
of
the
life
of
the
true
anchor
her
hansom
was
waiting
for
her
and
she
added
i
kept
it
you
see
but
a
little
extravagance
on
the
night
one
fortune
has
come
peter
stared
yes
there
were
people
whose
fortune
had
come
but
he
managed
to
stammer
are
you
following
her
again
for
you
for
you
and
she
clambered
into
the
vehicle
from
the
seat
enticingly
she
offered
him
the
place
beside
her
wo
you
come
too
i
know
he
invited
you
peter
declined
with
a
quick
gesture
and
as
he
turned
away
he
heard
her
call
after
him
to
cheer
him
on
his
lonely
walk
i
shall
keep
this
up
i
shall
never
lose
sight
of
her
book
eighth
xlvii
when
dallow
returned
to
london
just
before
london
broke
up
the
fact
was
immediately
known
in
calcutta
gardens
and
was
promptly
communicated
to
nick
dormer
by
his
sister
bridget
he
had
learnt
it
in
no
other
way
he
had
had
no
correspondence
with
julia
during
her
absence
he
gathered
that
his
mother
and
sisters
were
not
ignorant
of
her
whereabouts
he
never
mentioned
her
name
to
them
but
as
to
this
he
was
not
sure
if
the
source
of
their
information
had
been
the
or
a
casual
letter
received
by
the
inscrutable
biddy
he
knew
biddy
had
some
epistolary
commerce
with
julia
he
had
an
impression
grace
occasionally
exchanged
letters
with
gresham
biddy
however
who
as
he
was
also
well
aware
was
always
studying
what
he
would
like
forbore
to
talk
to
him
about
the
absent
mistress
of
harsh
beyond
once
dropping
the
remark
that
she
had
gone
from
florence
to
venice
and
was
enjoying
gondolas
and
sunsets
too
much
to
leave
them
nick
comment
on
this
was
that
she
was
a
happy
woman
to
have
such
a
go
at
titian
and
tintoret
as
he
spoke
and
for
some
time
afterwards
the
sense
of
how
he
himself
should
enjoy
a
like
go
made
him
ache
with
ineffectual
longing
he
had
forbidden
himself
at
the
present
to
think
of
absence
not
only
because
it
would
be
inconvenient
and
expensive
but
because
it
would
be
a
kind
of
retreat
from
the
enemy
a
concession
to
difficulty
the
enemy
was
no
particular
person
and
no
particular
body
of
persons
not
his
mother
not
carteret
who
as
he
heard
from
the
doctor
at
beauclere
lingered
on
sinking
and
sinking
till
his
vitality
appeared
to
have
the
vertical
depth
of
a
not
his
pacified
constituents
who
had
found
a
healthy
diversion
in
returning
another
liberal
wholly
without
dallow
aid
she
had
not
participated
even
to
the
extent
of
a
responsive
telegram
in
the
election
not
his
late
colleagues
in
the
house
nor
the
biting
satirists
of
the
newspapers
nor
the
brilliant
women
he
took
down
at
there
was
only
one
sense
in
which
he
ever
took
them
down
not
in
short
his
friends
his
foes
his
private
thoughts
the
periodical
phantom
of
his
shocked
father
the
enemy
was
simply
the
general
awkwardness
of
his
situation
this
awkwardness
was
connected
with
the
sense
of
responsibility
so
greatly
deprecated
by
gabriel
nash
gabriel
who
had
ceased
to
roam
of
late
on
purpose
to
miss
as
few
scenes
as
possible
of
the
drama
rapidly
growing
dull
alas
of
his
friend
destiny
but
that
compromising
relation
scarcely
drew
the
soreness
from
it
the
public
flurry
produced
by
his
collapse
had
only
been
large
enough
to
mark
the
flatness
of
our
young
man
position
when
it
was
over
to
have
had
a
few
jokes
cracked
audibly
at
your
expense
was
an
ordeal
worth
talking
of
the
hardest
thing
about
it
was
merely
that
there
had
not
been
enough
of
them
to
yield
a
proportion
of
good
ones
nick
had
felt
in
fine
the
benefit
of
living
in
an
age
and
in
a
society
where
number
and
pressure
have
for
the
individual
figure
especially
when
it
a
zero
compensations
almost
equal
to
their
cruelties
no
the
pinch
for
his
conscience
after
a
few
weeks
had
passed
was
simply
an
acute
mistrust
of
the
superficiality
of
performance
into
which
the
desire
to
justify
himself
might
hurry
him
that
desire
was
passionate
as
regards
julia
dallow
it
was
ardent
also
as
regards
his
mother
and
to
make
it
absolutely
uncomfortable
it
was
complicated
with
the
conviction
that
neither
of
them
would
know
his
justification
even
when
she
should
see
it
they
probably
could
know
it
if
they
would
and
very
certainly
would
if
they
could
he
assured
himself
however
that
this
limitation
would
matter
it
was
their
affair
his
own
was
simply
to
have
the
right
sort
of
thing
to
show
the
work
he
was
now
attempting
was
the
right
sort
of
thing
though
doubtless
julia
for
instance
would
dislike
it
almost
as
much
as
if
it
were
the
two
portraits
of
miriam
after
the
first
exhilaration
of
his
finding
himself
at
large
filled
him
with
no
private
glee
they
were
not
in
the
direction
in
which
he
wished
for
the
present
really
to
move
there
were
moments
when
he
felt
almost
angry
though
of
course
he
held
his
tongue
when
by
the
few
persons
who
saw
them
they
were
pronounced
wonderfully
clever
that
they
were
wonderfully
clever
was
just
the
detestable
thing
in
them
so
active
had
that
cleverness
been
in
making
them
seem
better
than
they
were
there
were
people
to
whom
he
would
have
been
ashamed
to
show
them
and
these
were
the
people
whom
it
would
give
him
most
pleasure
some
day
to
please
not
only
had
he
many
an
hour
of
disgust
at
his
actual
work
but
he
thought
he
saw
as
in
an
ugly
revelation
that
nature
had
cursed
him
with
an
odious
facility
and
that
the
lesson
of
his
life
the
sternest
and
wholesomest
would
be
to
keep
out
of
the
trap
it
had
laid
for
him
he
had
fallen
into
this
trap
on
the
threshold
and
had
only
scrambled
out
with
his
honour
he
had
a
talent
for
appearance
and
that
was
the
fatal
thing
he
had
a
damnable
suppleness
and
a
gift
of
immediate
response
a
readiness
to
oblige
that
made
him
seem
to
take
up
causes
which
he
really
left
lying
enabled
him
to
learn
enough
about
them
in
an
hour
to
have
all
the
air
of
having
converted
them
to
his
use
many
people
used
them
that
was
the
only
thing
to
be
said
who
had
taken
them
in
much
less
he
was
at
all
events
too
clever
by
half
since
this
pernicious
overflow
had
wrecked
most
of
his
attempts
he
had
assumed
a
virtue
and
enjoyed
assuming
it
and
the
assumption
had
cheated
his
father
and
his
mother
and
his
affianced
wife
and
his
rich
benefactor
and
the
candid
burgesses
of
harsh
and
the
cynical
reporters
of
the
newspapers
his
enthusiasms
had
been
but
young
curiosity
his
speeches
had
been
young
agility
his
professions
and
adhesions
had
been
like
without
glue
the
head
was
all
right
but
they
would
stick
he
stood
ready
now
to
wring
the
neck
of
the
irrepressible
vice
that
certainly
would
tend
to
nothing
so
much
as
to
get
him
into
further
trouble
his
only
real
justification
would
be
to
turn
patience
his
own
of
course
inside
out
yet
if
there
should
be
a
way
to
misread
that
recipe
his
humbugging
genius
could
be
trusted
infallibly
to
discover
it
cheap
and
easy
results
would
dangle
before
him
little
amateurish
conspicuities
at
exhibitions
helped
by
his
history
putting
it
in
his
power
to
triumph
with
a
quick
what
do
you
say
to
that
over
those
he
had
wounded
the
fear
of
this
danger
was
corrosive
it
poisoned
even
lawful
joys
if
he
should
have
a
striking
picture
at
the
academy
next
year
it
would
be
a
crime
yet
he
could
help
suspecting
any
conditions
that
would
enable
him
to
be
striking
so
soon
in
this
way
he
felt
quite
enough
how
gabriel
nash
had
had
him
whenever
railing
at
his
fever
for
proof
and
how
inferior
as
a
productive
force
the
desire
to
win
over
the
might
be
to
the
principle
of
quiet
growth
nash
had
a
foreign
manner
of
lifting
up
his
finger
and
waving
it
before
him
as
if
to
put
an
end
to
everything
whenever
it
became
in
conversation
or
discussion
to
any
extent
a
question
whether
any
one
would
like
anything
it
was
presumably
in
some
degree
at
least
a
due
respect
for
the
principle
of
quiet
growth
that
kept
nick
on
the
spot
at
present
made
him
stick
fast
to
rosedale
road
and
calcutta
gardens
and
deny
himself
the
simplifications
of
absence
do
what
he
would
he
could
despoil
himself
of
the
impression
that
the
disagreeable
was
somehow
connected
with
the
salutary
and
the
quiet
with
the
disagreeable
when
stubbornly
borne
so
he
resisted
a
hundred
impulses
to
run
away
to
paris
or
to
florence
coarse
forms
of
the
temptation
to
persuade
himself
by
material
motion
that
he
was
launched
he
stayed
in
london
because
it
seemed
to
him
he
was
there
more
conscious
of
what
he
had
undertaken
and
he
had
a
horror
of
shirking
the
consciousness
one
element
in
it
indeed
was
his
noting
how
little
convenience
he
could
have
found
in
a
foreign
journey
even
had
his
judgement
approved
such
a
subterfuge
the
stoppage
of
his
supplies
from
beauclere
had
now
become
an
historic
fact
with
something
of
the
majesty
of
its
class
about
it
he
had
had
time
to
see
what
a
difference
this
would
make
in
his
life
his
means
were
small
and
he
had
several
old
debts
the
number
of
which
as
he
believed
loomed
large
to
his
mother
imagination
he
could
never
tell
her
she
exaggerated
because
he
told
her
nothing
of
that
sort
in
these
days
they
had
no
intimate
talk
for
an
impenetrable
partition
a
tall
bristling
hedge
of
untrimmed
misconceptions
had
sprung
up
between
them
poor
biddy
had
made
a
hole
in
it
through
which
she
squeezed
from
side
to
side
to
keep
up
communications
at
the
cost
of
many
rents
and
scratches
but
lady
agnes
walked
straight
and
stiff
never
turning
her
head
never
stopping
to
pluck
the
least
little
daisy
of
consolation
it
was
in
this
manner
she
wished
to
signify
that
she
had
accepted
her
wrongs
she
draped
herself
in
them
as
in
a
roman
mantle
and
had
never
looked
so
proud
and
wasted
and
handsome
as
now
that
her
eyes
rested
only
on
ruins
nick
was
extremely
sorry
for
her
though
he
marked
as
a
dreadful
want
of
grace
her
never
setting
a
foot
in
rosedale
road
she
mentioned
his
studio
no
more
than
if
it
had
been
a
private
or
something
worse
sorry
because
he
was
well
aware
that
for
the
hour
everything
must
appear
to
her
to
have
crumbled
the
luxury
of
broadwood
would
have
to
crumble
his
mind
was
very
clear
about
that
biddy
prospects
had
withered
to
the
finest
dreariest
dust
and
biddy
indeed
taking
a
lesson
from
her
brother
perversities
seemed
little
disposed
to
better
a
bad
business
she
professed
the
most
sentiments
but
when
it
came
really
to
doing
something
to
brighten
up
the
scene
she
showed
herself
portentously
corrupt
after
peter
sherringham
heartless
flight
she
had
wantonly
slighted
an
excellent
opportunity
to
repair
her
misfortune
lady
agnes
had
reason
to
infer
about
the
end
of
june
that
young
grindon
the
only
son
the
other
children
being
girls
of
an
immensely
rich
industrial
and
political
baronet
in
the
north
was
literally
waiting
for
the
faintest
sign
this
reason
she
promptly
imparted
to
her
younger
daughter
whose
intelligence
had
to
take
it
in
but
who
had
shown
it
no
other
consideration
biddy
had
set
her
charming
face
as
a
stone
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
signs
and
she
practically
speaking
wilfully
wickedly
refused
a
magnificent
offer
so
that
the
young
man
carried
his
high
expectations
elsewhere
how
much
in
earnest
he
had
been
was
proved
by
the
fact
that
before
goodwood
had
come
and
gone
he
was
captured
by
lady
muriel
macpherson
it
was
superfluous
to
insist
on
the
frantic
determination
to
get
married
written
on
such
an
accident
as
that
nick
knew
of
this
episode
only
through
grace
and
he
deplored
its
having
occurred
in
the
midst
of
other
disasters
he
knew
or
he
suspected
something
more
as
well
something
about
his
brother
percival
which
should
it
come
to
light
no
phase
of
their
common
history
would
be
genial
enough
to
gloss
over
it
had
usually
been
supposed
that
percy
store
of
comfort
against
the
ills
of
life
was
confined
to
the
infallibility
of
his
rifle
he
was
not
sensitive
and
his
use
of
that
weapon
represented
a
resource
against
which
common
visitations
might
have
spent
themselves
it
had
suddenly
come
to
ears
however
that
he
cultivated
a
concurrent
support
in
the
person
of
a
robust
countrywoman
housed
in
an
ivied
corner
of
warwickshire
in
whom
he
had
long
been
interested
and
whom
without
any
flourish
of
magnanimity
he
had
ended
by
making
his
wife
the
situation
of
the
latest
born
of
the
pledges
of
this
affection
a
blooming
boy
there
had
been
two
or
three
previously
was
therefore
perfectly
regular
and
of
a
nature
to
make
a
difference
in
the
worldly
position
as
the
phrase
ran
of
his
moneyless
uncle
if
there
be
degrees
in
the
absolute
and
percy
had
an
heir
others
moreover
supposedly
following
nick
would
have
to
regard
himself
as
still
more
moneyless
than
before
his
brother
last
step
was
doubtless
given
the
case
to
be
commended
but
such
discoveries
were
enlivening
only
when
made
in
other
families
and
lady
agnes
would
scarcely
enjoy
learning
to
what
tune
she
had
become
a
grandmother
nick
forbore
from
delicacy
to
intimate
to
biddy
that
he
thought
it
a
pity
she
could
care
for
grindon
but
he
had
a
private
sense
that
if
she
had
been
capable
of
such
a
feat
it
would
have
lightened
a
little
the
weight
he
himself
had
to
carry
he
bore
her
a
slight
grudge
which
lasted
till
julia
dallow
came
back
when
the
circumstance
of
the
being
summoned
immediately
down
to
harsh
created
a
diversion
that
was
perhaps
after
all
only
fanciful
biddy
as
we
know
entertained
a
theory
which
nick
had
found
occasion
to
combat
that
dallow
had
not
treated
him
perfectly
well
therefore
in
going
to
harsh
the
very
first
time
that
relative
held
out
a
hand
to
her
so
jealous
a
little
sister
must
have
recognised
a
special
inducement
the
inducement
might
have
been
that
the
relative
had
comfort
for
her
that
she
was
acting
by
her
cousin
direct
advice
that
they
were
still
in
close
communion
on
the
question
of
the
offers
biddy
was
not
to
accept
that
in
short
peter
sister
had
taken
upon
herself
to
see
that
their
young
friend
should
remain
free
for
the
day
of
the
fugitive
inevitable
return
once
or
twice
indeed
nick
wondered
if
julia
had
herself
been
visited
in
a
larger
sense
by
the
thought
of
retracing
her
steps
if
she
wished
to
draw
out
her
young
friend
opinion
as
to
how
she
might
do
that
gracefully
during
the
few
days
she
was
in
town
nick
had
seen
her
twice
in
great
stanhope
street
but
neither
time
alone
she
had
said
to
him
on
one
of
these
occasions
in
her
odd
explosive
way
i
should
have
thought
you
have
gone
away
somewhere
it
must
be
such
a
bore
of
course
she
firmly
believed
he
was
staying
for
miriam
which
he
really
was
not
and
probably
she
had
written
this
false
impression
off
to
peter
who
still
more
probably
would
prefer
to
regard
it
as
just
nick
was
staying
for
miriam
only
in
the
sense
that
he
should
very
glad
of
the
money
he
might
receive
for
the
portrait
he
was
engaged
in
painting
that
money
would
be
a
great
convenience
to
him
in
spite
of
the
obstructive
ground
miriam
had
taken
in
pretending
she
had
blown
half
a
gale
about
it
that
he
had
had
no
right
to
dispose
of
such
a
production
without
her
consent
his
answer
to
this
was
simply
that
the
purchaser
was
so
little
of
a
stranger
that
it
did
go
so
to
speak
out
of
the
family
out
of
hers
it
did
matter
miriam
retort
that
if
sherringham
had
formerly
been
no
stranger
he
was
utterly
one
now
so
that
nothing
would
ever
less
delight
him
than
to
see
her
hated
image
on
his
wall
he
would
back
out
of
the
bargain
and
nick
be
left
with
the
picture
on
his
hands
nick
jeered
at
this
shallow
theory
and
when
she
came
to
sit
the
question
served
as
well
as
another
to
sprinkle
their
familiar
silences
with
chaff
he
already
knew
something
as
we
have
seen
of
the
conditions
in
which
his
distracted
kinsman
had
left
england
and
this
connected
itself
in
casual
meditation
with
some
of
the
calculations
imputable
to
julia
and
to
biddy
there
had
naturally
been
a
sequel
to
the
queer
behaviour
perceptible
in
peter
at
the
theatre
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
a
sequel
lighted
by
a
word
of
miriam
in
the
course
of
her
first
sitting
to
nick
after
her
great
night
fancy
so
this
observation
ran
fancy
the
dear
man
finding
time
in
the
press
of
all
his
last
duties
to
ask
me
to
marry
him
he
told
me
you
had
found
time
in
the
press
of
all
yours
to
say
you
would
nick
replied
and
this
was
pretty
much
all
that
had
passed
on
the
subject
between
them
save
of
course
her
immediately
making
clear
that
peter
had
grossly
misinformed
him
what
had
happened
was
that
she
had
said
she
would
do
nothing
of
the
sort
she
professed
a
desire
not
to
be
confronted
again
with
this
obnoxious
theme
and
nick
easily
fell
in
with
it
quite
from
his
own
settled
inclination
not
to
handle
that
kind
of
subject
with
her
if
julia
had
false
ideas
about
him
and
if
peter
had
them
too
his
part
of
the
business
was
to
take
the
simplest
course
to
establish
the
falsity
there
were
difficulties
indeed
attached
even
to
the
simplest
course
but
there
would
be
a
difficulty
the
less
if
one
should
forbear
to
meddle
in
promiscuous
talk
with
the
general
suggestive
topic
of
intimate
unions
it
is
certain
that
in
these
days
nick
cultivated
the
practice
of
forbearances
for
which
he
receive
for
which
perhaps
he
never
would
receive
due
credit
he
had
been
convinced
for
some
time
that
one
of
the
next
things
he
should
hear
would
be
that
julia
dallow
had
arranged
to
marry
either
macgeorge
or
some
other
master
of
multitudes
he
could
think
of
that
now
he
found
think
of
it
with
resignation
even
when
julia
before
his
eyes
looked
so
handsomely
forgetful
that
her
appearance
had
to
be
taken
as
referring
still
more
to
their
original
intimacy
than
to
his
comparatively
superficial
offence
what
made
this
accomplishment
of
his
own
remarkable
was
that
there
was
something
else
he
thought
of
quite
as
much
the
fact
that
he
had
only
to
see
her
again
to
feel
by
how
great
a
charm
she
had
in
the
old
days
taken
possession
of
him
this
charm
operated
apparently
in
a
very
direct
primitive
way
her
presence
diffused
it
and
fully
established
it
but
her
absence
left
comparatively
little
of
it
behind
it
dwelt
in
the
very
facts
of
her
person
it
was
something
she
happened
physically
to
be
yet
considering
that
the
question
was
of
something
very
like
loveliness
its
envelope
of
associations
of
memories
and
recurrences
had
no
great
destiny
she
packed
it
up
and
took
it
away
with
her
quite
as
if
she
had
been
a
woman
who
had
come
to
sell
a
set
of
laces
the
laces
were
as
wonderful
as
ever
when
taken
out
of
the
box
but
to
admire
again
their
rarity
you
had
to
send
for
the
woman
what
was
above
all
remarkable
for
our
young
man
was
that
miriam
rooth
fetched
a
fellow
vulgarly
speaking
very
much
less
than
julia
at
the
times
when
being
on
the
spot
julia
did
fetch
he
could
paint
miriam
day
after
day
without
any
agitating
blur
of
vision
in
fact
the
more
he
saw
of
her
the
clearer
grew
the
atmosphere
through
which
she
blazed
the
more
her
richness
became
one
with
that
of
the
flowering
work
there
are
reciprocities
and
special
sympathies
in
such
a
relation
mysterious
affinities
they
used
to
be
called
divinations
of
private
congruity
nick
had
an
unexpressed
conviction
that
if
according
to
his
defeated
desire
he
had
embarked
with
dallow
in
this
particular
quest
of
a
great
prize
disaster
would
have
overtaken
them
on
the
deep
waters
even
with
the
limited
risk
indeed
disaster
had
come
but
it
was
of
a
different
kind
and
it
had
the
advantage
for
him
that
now
she
could
reproach
and
denounce
him
as
the
cause
of
it
could
do
so
at
least
on
any
ground
he
was
obliged
to
recognise
she
would
never
know
how
much
he
had
cared
for
her
how
much
he
cared
for
her
still
inasmuch
as
the
conclusive
proof
for
himself
was
his
conscious
reluctance
to
care
for
another
woman
evidence
she
positively
misread
some
day
he
would
doubtless
try
to
do
that
but
such
a
day
seemed
as
yet
far
off
and
he
had
meanwhile
no
spite
no
vindictive
impulse
to
help
him
the
soreness
that
mingled
with
his
liberation
the
sense
of
indignity
even
as
of
a
full
cup
suddenly
dashed
by
a
blundering
hand
from
his
lips
demanded
certainly
a
balm
but
it
found
the
balm
for
the
time
in
another
passion
not
in
a
rancorous
exercise
of
the
same
a
passion
strong
enough
to
make
him
forget
what
a
pity
it
was
he
was
not
so
formed
as
to
care
for
two
women
at
once
as
soon
as
julia
returned
to
england
he
broke
ground
to
his
mother
on
the
subject
of
her
making
the
mistress
of
broadwood
understand
that
she
and
the
girls
now
regarded
their
occupancy
of
that
estate
as
absolutely
over
he
had
already
several
weeks
before
picked
a
little
at
the
arid
tract
of
that
indicated
surrender
but
in
the
interval
the
soil
appeared
to
have
formed
again
to
a
considerable
thickness
it
was
disagreeable
to
him
to
call
his
parent
attention
to
the
becoming
course
and
especially
disagreeable
to
have
to
emphasise
it
and
discuss
it
and
perhaps
clamour
for
it
he
would
have
liked
the
whole
business
to
be
tacit
a
little
triumph
of
silent
delicacy
but
he
found
reasons
to
suspect
that
what
in
fact
would
be
most
tacit
was
julia
certain
endurance
of
any
chance
failure
of
that
charm
lady
agnes
had
a
theory
that
they
had
virtually
practically
as
she
said
given
up
the
place
so
that
there
was
no
need
of
making
a
splash
about
it
but
nick
discovered
in
the
course
of
an
exploration
of
biddy
view
more
rigorous
perhaps
than
any
to
which
he
had
ever
subjected
her
that
none
of
their
property
had
been
removed
from
the
delightful
house
none
of
the
things
there
were
ever
so
many
things
heavily
planted
there
when
their
mother
took
possession
lady
agnes
was
the
proprietor
of
innumerable
articles
of
furniture
relics
and
survivals
of
her
former
greatness
and
moved
about
the
world
with
a
train
of
heterogeneous
baggage
so
that
her
quiet
overflow
into
the
spaciousness
of
broadwood
had
had
all
the
luxury
of
a
final
subsidence
what
nick
had
to
propose
to
her
now
was
a
dreadful
combination
a
relapse
into
the
conditions
she
most
hated
seaside
lodgings
bald
storehouses
in
the
marylebone
road
little
london
rooms
crammed
with
objects
that
caught
the
dirt
and
made
them
stuffy
he
was
afraid
he
should
really
finish
her
and
he
himself
was
surprised
in
a
degree
at
his
insistence
he
would
have
supposed
he
should
have
cared
so
much
but
he
found
he
did
care
intensely
he
cared
enough
it
says
everything
to
explain
to
his
mother
that
her
retention
of
broadwood
would
show
practically
since
that
was
her
great
word
for
the
violation
of
an
agreement
julia
had
given
them
the
place
on
the
understanding
that
he
was
to
marry
her
and
once
he
was
definitely
not
to
marry
her
they
had
no
right
to
keep
the
place
yes
you
make
the
mess
and
pay
the
penalty
the
poor
lady
flashed
out
but
this
was
the
only
overt
protest
she
made
except
indeed
to
contend
that
their
withdrawal
would
be
an
act
ungracious
and
offensive
to
julia
she
looked
as
she
had
looked
during
the
months
that
succeeded
his
father
death
but
she
gave
a
general
a
final
grim
assent
to
the
proposition
that
let
their
kinswoman
take
it
as
she
would
their
own
duty
was
unmistakably
clear
it
was
grace
who
was
principal
representative
of
the
idea
that
julia
would
be
outraged
by
such
a
step
she
never
ceased
to
repeat
that
she
had
never
heard
of
anything
so
nasty
nick
would
have
expected
this
of
grace
but
he
felt
rather
bereft
and
betrayed
when
biddy
murmured
to
him
that
knew
that
there
was
really
no
need
of
their
sacrificing
their
mother
comfort
to
an
extravagant
scruple
she
intimated
that
if
nick
would
only
consent
to
their
going
on
with
broadwood
as
if
nothing
had
happened
or
rather
as
if
everything
had
happened
she
would
answer
for
the
feelings
of
the
owner
for
almost
the
first
time
in
his
life
nick
disliked
what
biddy
said
to
him
and
he
gave
her
a
sharp
rejoinder
a
taste
of
the
general
opinion
that
they
all
had
enough
to
do
to
answer
for
themselves
he
remembered
afterwards
the
way
she
looked
at
him
startled
even
frightened
and
with
rising
tears
before
turning
away
he
held
that
they
should
judge
better
how
julia
would
take
it
after
they
had
thrown
up
the
place
and
he
made
it
his
duty
to
arrange
that
his
mother
should
formally
advise
her
by
letter
of
their
intending
to
depart
at
once
julia
could
then
protest
to
her
content
nick
was
aware
that
for
the
most
part
he
did
pass
for
practical
he
could
imagine
why
from
his
early
years
people
should
have
joked
him
about
it
but
this
time
he
was
determined
to
rest
on
a
rigid
view
of
things
as
they
were
he
did
sec
his
mother
letter
but
he
knew
that
it
went
he
felt
she
would
have
been
more
loyal
if
she
had
shown
it
to
him
though
of
course
there
could
be
but
little
question
of
loyalty
now
that
it
had
really
been
written
however
very
much
on
the
lines
he
dictated
was
clear
to
him
from
the
subsequent
surprise
which
lady
agnes
blankness
did
prevent
his
divining
julia
acknowledged
the
offered
news
but
in
unexpected
terms
she
had
apparently
neither
resisted
nor
protested
she
had
simply
been
very
glad
to
get
her
house
back
again
and
had
not
accused
any
of
them
of
nastiness
nick
saw
no
more
of
her
letter
than
he
had
seen
of
his
mother
but
he
was
able
to
say
to
grace
to
their
parent
he
was
studiously
mute
my
poor
child
you
see
after
all
that
we
kicked
up
such
a
row
grace
shook
her
head
and
looked
gloomy
and
deeply
wise
replying
that
he
had
no
cause
to
triumph
they
were
so
far
from
having
seen
the
end
of
it
yet
thus
he
guessed
that
his
mother
had
complied
with
his
wish
on
the
calculation
that
it
would
be
a
mere
form
that
julia
would
entreat
them
not
to
be
so
fantastic
and
that
he
himself
would
then
in
the
presence
of
her
wounded
surprise
consent
to
a
quiet
continuance
so
much
in
the
interest
the
air
of
broadwood
had
a
purity
of
the
health
of
all
of
them
but
since
julia
jumped
at
their
sacrifice
he
had
no
chance
to
be
mollified
he
had
all
grossly
to
persist
in
having
been
right
at
bottom
probably
he
was
a
little
surprised
at
julia
so
prompt
assent
literally
speaking
it
was
not
perfectly
graceful
he
was
sorry
his
mother
had
been
so
deceived
but
was
sorrier
still
for
mistake
it
showed
she
might
be
mistaken
about
other
things
nothing
was
left
now
but
for
lady
agnes
to
say
as
she
did
substantially
whenever
she
saw
him
we
to
prepare
to
spend
the
autumn
at
worthing
then
or
some
other
horrible
place
i
do
know
their
names
it
the
only
thing
we
can
afford
there
was
an
implication
in
this
that
if
he
expected
her
to
drag
her
girls
about
to
in
a
continuance
of
the
fidgety
effort
to
work
them
off
he
must
understand
at
once
that
she
was
now
too
weary
and
too
sad
and
too
sick
she
had
done
her
best
for
them
and
it
had
all
been
vain
and
cruel
now
therefore
the
poor
creatures
must
look
out
for
themselves
to
the
grossness
of
biddy
misconduct
she
need
refer
nor
to
the
golden
opportunity
that
young
woman
had
forfeited
by
her
odious
treatment
of
grindon
it
was
clear
that
this
time
lady
agnes
was
incurably
discouraged
so
much
so
as
to
fail
to
glean
the
dimmest
light
from
the
fact
that
the
girl
was
really
making
a
long
stay
at
harsh
biddy
went
to
and
fro
two
or
three
times
and
then
in
august
fairly
settled
there
and
what
her
mother
mainly
saw
in
her
absence
was
the
desire
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
household
reminders
of
her
depravity
in
fact
as
turned
out
lady
agnes
and
grace
gathered
themselves
together
in
the
first
days
of
that
month
for
another
visit
to
the
very
old
lady
who
had
been
sir
nicholas
godmother
after
which
they
went
somewhere
else
so
that
the
question
of
worthing
had
not
immediately
to
be
faced
nick
stayed
on
in
london
with
the
obsession
of
work
humming
in
his
ears
he
was
joyfully
conscious
that
for
three
or
four
months
in
the
empty
babylon
he
would
have
ample
stores
of
time
but
toward
the
end
of
august
he
got
a
letter
from
grace
in
which
she
spoke
of
her
situation
and
of
her
mother
in
a
manner
that
seemed
to
impose
on
him
the
doing
of
something
tactful
they
were
paying
a
third
visit
he
knew
that
in
calcutta
gardens
had
been
to
and
fro
with
boxes
replenishments
of
wardrobes
and
yet
somehow
the
outlook
for
the
autumn
was
dark
grace
did
say
it
in
so
many
words
but
what
he
read
between
the
lines
was
that
they
had
no
more
invitations
what
therefore
in
pity
name
was
to
become
of
them
people
liked
them
well
enough
when
biddy
was
with
them
but
they
did
care
for
her
mother
and
her
that
prospect
and
biddy
was
cooped
up
indefinitely
with
julia
this
was
not
the
manner
in
which
grace
had
anciently
alluded
to
her
sister
happy
visits
at
harsh
and
the
change
of
tone
made
nick
wince
with
a
sense
of
all
that
had
collapsed
biddy
was
a
little
fish
worth
landing
in
short
scantly
as
she
seemed
disposed
to
bite
and
rude
probity
could
admit
that
she
herself
was
not
nick
had
an
inspiration
by
way
of
doing
something
tactful
he
went
down
to
brighton
and
took
lodgings
for
several
weeks
in
the
general
interest
the
very
quietest
and
sunniest
he
could
find
this
he
intended
as
a
kindly
surprise
a
reminder
of
how
he
had
his
mother
and
comfort
at
heart
how
he
could
exert
himself
and
save
them
trouble
but
he
had
no
sooner
concluded
his
bargain
it
was
a
more
costly
one
than
he
had
at
first
calculated
than
he
was
bewildered
and
befogged
to
learn
that
the
persons
on
whose
behalf
he
had
so
exerted
himself
were
to
pass
the
autumn
at
broadwood
with
julia
that
daughter
of
privilege
had
taken
the
place
into
familiar
use
again
and
was
now
correcting
their
former
surprise
at
her
crude
indifference
this
was
infinitely
characteristic
of
julia
by
inviting
them
to
share
it
with
her
nick
wondered
vaguely
what
she
was
up
to
but
when
his
mother
treated
herself
to
the
line
irony
of
addressing
him
an
elaborately
humble
request
for
his
consent
to
their
accepting
the
merciful
refuge
she
repeated
this
expression
three
times
he
replied
that
she
might
do
exactly
as
she
liked
he
would
only
mention
that
he
should
feel
himself
at
liberty
to
come
and
see
her
there
this
condition
proved
apparently
to
lady
agnes
mind
no
hindrance
and
she
and
her
daughters
were
presently
reinstated
in
the
very
apartments
they
had
learned
so
to
love
this
time
in
fact
it
was
even
better
than
before
they
had
still
fewer
expenses
the
expenses
were
nick
he
had
to
pay
a
forfeit
to
the
landlady
at
brighton
for
backing
out
of
his
contract
he
said
nothing
to
his
mother
about
that
bungled
business
he
was
literally
afraid
but
a
sad
event
just
then
reminded
him
afresh
how
little
it
was
the
moment
for
squandering
money
carteret
drew
his
last
breath
quite
painlessly
it
seemed
as
the
closing
scene
was
described
at
beauclere
when
the
young
man
went
down
to
the
funeral
two
or
three
weeks
later
the
contents
of
his
will
were
made
public
in
the
london
where
it
definitely
appeared
that
he
left
a
very
large
fortune
not
a
penny
of
which
was
to
go
to
nick
the
provision
for
chayter
declining
years
was
remarkably
handsome
xlviii
miriam
had
mounted
at
a
bound
in
her
new
part
several
steps
in
the
ladder
of
fame
and
at
the
climax
of
the
london
season
this
fact
was
brought
home
to
her
from
hour
to
hour
it
produced
a
thousand
solicitations
and
entanglements
and
she
rapidly
learned
that
to
be
celebrated
takes
up
almost
as
much
of
one
own
time
as
of
other
people
even
though
as
she
boasted
she
had
reduced
to
a
science
the
practice
of
working
her
mother
she
made
use
of
the
good
lady
socially
to
the
utmost
pushing
her
perpetually
into
the
breach
there
was
many
a
juncture
at
which
it
was
clear
that
she
could
too
much
disoblige
without
hurting
her
cause
she
made
almost
an
income
out
of
the
photographers
their
appreciation
of
her
as
a
subject
knew
no
bounds
and
she
supplied
the
newspapers
with
columns
of
characteristic
copy
to
the
gentlemen
who
sought
speech
of
her
on
behalf
of
these
organs
she
poured
forth
vindictively
floods
of
unscrupulous
romance
she
told
them
all
different
tales
and
as
her
mother
told
them
others
more
marvellous
yet
publicity
was
cleverly
caught
by
rival
versions
which
surpassed
each
other
in
authenticity
the
whole
case
was
remarkable
was
unique
for
if
the
girl
was
advertised
by
the
bewilderment
of
her
readers
she
seemed
to
every
sceptic
on
his
going
to
see
her
as
fine
as
if
he
had
discovered
her
for
himself
she
was
still
accommodating
enough
however
from
time
to
time
to
find
an
hour
to
come
and
sit
to
nick
dormer
and
he
helped
himself
further
by
going
to
her
theatre
whenever
he
could
he
was
conscious
julia
dallow
would
probably
hear
of
this
and
triumph
with
a
fresh
sense
of
how
right
she
had
been
but
the
reflexion
only
made
him
sigh
resignedly
so
true
it
struck
him
as
being
that
there
are
some
things
explanation
can
never
better
can
never
touch
miriam
brought
basil
dashwood
once
to
see
her
portrait
and
basil
who
commended
it
in
general
directed
his
criticism
mainly
to
two
points
its
not
yet
being
finished
and
its
not
having
gone
into
that
year
academy
the
young
actor
audibly
panted
he
felt
the
short
breath
of
miriam
rapidity
the
quick
beat
of
her
success
and
looking
at
everything
now
from
the
standpoint
of
that
speculation
could
scarcely
contain
his
impatience
at
the
painter
clumsy
slowness
he
thought
the
latter
second
attempt
much
better
than
his
first
but
somehow
it
ought
by
that
time
to
be
shining
in
the
eye
of
the
public
he
put
it
to
their
friend
with
an
air
of
acuteness
he
had
those
felicities
that
in
every
great
crisis
there
is
nothing
like
striking
while
the
iron
is
hot
he
even
betrayed
the
conviction
that
by
putting
on
a
spurt
nick
might
wind
up
the
job
and
still
get
the
academy
people
to
take
him
in
basil
knew
some
of
them
he
all
but
offered
to
speak
to
them
the
case
was
so
exceptional
he
had
no
doubt
he
could
get
something
done
against
the
appropriation
of
the
work
by
peter
sherringham
he
explicitly
and
loudly
protested
in
spite
of
the
homeliest
recommendations
of
silence
from
miriam
and
it
was
indeed
easy
to
guess
how
such
an
arrangement
would
interfere
with
his
own
conception
of
the
eventual
right
place
for
the
two
portraits
the
vestibule
of
the
theatre
where
every
one
going
in
and
out
would
see
them
suspended
face
to
face
and
surrounded
by
photographs
artistically
disposed
of
the
young
actress
in
a
variety
of
characters
dashwood
showed
superiority
in
his
jump
to
the
contention
that
so
exhibited
the
pictures
would
really
help
to
draw
considering
the
virtue
he
attributed
to
miriam
the
idea
was
exempt
from
narrow
prejudice
moreover
though
a
trifle
feverish
he
was
really
genial
he
repeated
more
than
once
yes
my
dear
sir
you
done
it
this
time
this
was
a
favourite
formula
with
him
when
some
allusion
was
made
to
the
success
he
greeted
it
also
with
a
comfortable
this
time
she
done
it
there
was
ever
a
hint
of
fine
judgement
and
far
calculation
in
his
tone
it
appeared
before
he
went
that
this
time
even
he
himself
had
done
it
he
had
taken
up
something
that
would
really
answer
he
told
nick
more
about
miriam
more
certainly
about
her
outlook
at
that
moment
than
she
herself
had
communicated
contributing
strongly
to
our
young
impression
that
one
by
one
every
gage
of
a
great
career
was
being
dropped
into
her
cup
nick
himself
tasted
of
success
vicariously
for
the
hour
miriam
let
her
comrade
talk
only
to
contradict
him
and
contradicted
him
only
to
show
how
indifferently
she
could
do
it
she
treated
him
as
if
she
had
nothing
more
to
learn
about
his
folly
but
as
if
it
had
taken
intimate
friendship
to
reveal
to
her
the
full
extent
of
it
nick
did
mind
her
intimate
friendships
but
he
ended
by
disliking
dashwood
who
gave
on
his
nerves
a
circumstance
poor
julia
had
it
come
to
her
knowledge
would
doubtless
have
found
deplorably
significant
miriam
was
more
pleased
with
herself
than
ever
she
now
made
no
scruple
of
admitting
that
she
enjoyed
all
her
advantages
she
had
a
fuller
vision
of
how
successful
success
could
be
she
took
everything
as
it
came
dined
out
every
sunday
and
even
went
into
the
country
till
the
monday
morning
kept
a
hundred
distinguished
names
on
her
lips
and
abounded
in
strange
tales
of
the
people
who
were
making
up
to
her
she
struck
nick
as
less
strenuous
than
she
had
been
hitherto
as
making
even
an
aggressive
show
of
inevitable
laxities
but
he
was
conscious
of
no
obligation
to
rebuke
her
for
it
the
less
as
he
had
a
dim
vision
that
some
effect
of
that
sort
some
irritation
of
his
curiosity
was
what
she
desired
to
produce
she
would
perhaps
have
liked
for
reasons
best
known
to
herself
to
look
as
if
she
were
throwing
herself
away
not
being
able
to
do
anything
else
he
could
talk
to
her
as
if
he
took
a
deep
interest
in
her
career
because
in
fact
he
did
she
remained
to
him
primarily
and
essentially
a
pictorial
object
with
the
nature
of
whose
vicissitudes
he
was
concerned
putting
common
charity
and
his
personal
good
nature
of
course
aside
only
so
far
as
they
had
something
to
say
in
her
face
how
could
he
know
in
advance
what
turn
of
her
experience
twist
of
her
life
would
say
most
so
possible
was
it
even
that
complete
failure
or
some
incalculable
perversion
innumerable
were
the
queer
traps
that
might
be
set
for
her
would
only
make
her
for
his
particular
purpose
more
precious
when
she
had
left
him
at
any
rate
the
day
she
came
with
basil
dashwood
and
still
more
on
a
later
occasion
that
of
his
turning
back
to
his
work
after
putting
her
into
her
carriage
and
otherwise
manifesting
the
last
time
for
that
year
apparently
that
he
was
to
see
her
when
she
had
left
him
it
occurred
to
him
in
the
light
of
her
quick
distinction
that
there
were
deep
differences
in
the
famous
artistic
life
miriam
was
already
in
a
glow
of
glory
which
moreover
was
probably
but
a
faint
spark
in
relation
to
the
blaze
to
come
and
as
he
closed
the
door
on
her
and
took
up
his
palette
to
rub
it
with
a
dirty
cloth
the
little
room
in
which
his
own
battle
was
practically
to
be
fought
looked
woefully
cold
and
grey
and
mean
it
was
lonely
and
yet
at
the
same
time
was
peopled
with
unfriendly
shadows
so
thick
he
foresaw
them
gather
in
winter
twilights
to
come
the
duller
conditions
the
longer
patiences
the
less
immediate
and
less
personal
joys
his
late
beginning
was
there
and
his
wasted
youth
the
mistakes
that
would
still
bring
forth
children
after
their
image
the
sedentary
solitude
the
grey
mediocrity
the
poor
explanations
the
effect
of
foolishness
he
dreaded
even
from
afar
of
in
having
to
ask
people
to
wait
and
wait
longer
and
wait
again
for
a
fruition
which
to
their
sense
at
least
might
well
prove
a
grotesque
he
yearned
enough
over
it
however
it
should
figure
to
feel
that
this
possible
pertinacity
might
enter
into
comparison
even
with
such
a
productive
force
as
miriam
that
was
after
all
in
his
bare
studio
the
most
collective
dim
presence
the
one
that
kept
him
company
best
as
he
sat
there
and
that
made
it
the
right
place
however
wrong
the
sense
that
it
was
to
the
thing
in
itself
he
was
attached
this
was
miriam
case
too
but
the
sharp
contrast
which
she
showed
him
she
also
felt
was
in
the
number
of
other
things
she
got
with
the
thing
in
itself
i
hasten
to
add
that
our
young
man
had
hours
when
this
last
mystic
value
struck
him
as
requiring
for
its
full
operation
no
adjunct
whatever
as
being
in
its
own
splendour
a
summary
of
all
adjuncts
and
apologies
i
have
related
that
the
great
collections
the
national
gallery
and
the
museum
were
sometimes
rather
a
series
of
dead
surfaces
to
him
but
the
sketch
i
have
attempted
of
him
will
have
been
inadequate
if
it
fails
to
suggest
that
there
were
other
days
when
as
he
strolled
through
them
he
plucked
right
and
left
perfect
nosegays
of
reassurance
bent
as
he
was
on
working
in
the
modern
which
spoke
to
him
with
a
thousand
voices
he
judged
it
better
for
long
periods
not
to
haunt
the
earlier
masters
whose
conditions
had
been
so
different
later
he
came
to
see
that
it
did
matter
much
especially
if
one
kept
away
but
he
was
liable
to
accidental
deflexions
from
this
theory
liable
in
particular
to
feel
the
sanctity
of
the
great
portraits
of
the
past
these
were
the
things
the
most
inspiring
in
the
sense
that
while
generations
while
worlds
had
come
and
gone
they
seemed
far
most
to
prevail
and
survive
and
testify
as
he
stood
before
them
the
perfection
of
their
survival
often
struck
him
as
the
supreme
eloquence
the
virtue
that
included
all
others
thanks
to
the
language
of
art
the
richest
and
most
universal
empires
and
systems
and
conquests
had
rolled
over
the
globe
and
every
kind
of
greatness
had
risen
and
passed
away
but
the
beauty
of
the
great
pictures
had
known
nothing
of
death
or
change
and
the
tragic
centuries
had
only
sweetened
their
freshness
the
same
faces
the
same
figures
looked
out
at
different
worlds
knowing
so
many
secrets
the
particular
world
did
and
when
they
joined
hands
they
made
the
indestructible
thread
on
which
the
pearls
of
history
were
strung
miriam
notified
her
artist
that
her
theatre
was
to
close
on
the
tenth
of
august
immediately
after
which
she
was
to
start
with
the
company
on
a
tremendous
tour
of
the
provinces
they
were
to
make
a
lot
of
money
but
they
were
to
have
no
holiday
and
she
did
want
one
she
only
wanted
to
keep
at
it
and
make
the
most
of
her
limited
opportunities
for
practice
inasmuch
as
at
that
rate
playing
but
two
parts
a
year
and
such
parts
she
despised
them
she
should
have
mastered
the
rudiments
of
her
trade
before
decrepitude
would
compel
her
to
lay
it
by
the
first
time
she
came
to
the
studio
after
her
visit
with
dashwood
she
sprang
up
abruptly
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
saying
she
could
sit
no
more
she
had
had
enough
and
to
spare
of
it
she
was
visibly
restless
and
preoccupied
and
though
nick
had
not
waited
till
now
to
note
that
she
had
more
moods
in
her
list
than
he
had
tints
on
his
palette
he
had
never
yet
seen
her
sensibility
at
this
particular
pitch
it
struck
him
rather
as
a
waste
of
passion
but
he
was
ready
to
let
her
go
she
looked
round
the
place
as
if
suddenly
tired
of
it
and
then
said
mechanically
in
a
heartless
london
way
while
she
smoothed
down
her
gloves
so
you
just
going
to
stay
on
after
he
had
confessed
that
this
was
his
dark
purpose
she
continued
in
the
same
casual
manner
i
daresay
it
the
best
thing
for
you
you
just
going
to
grind
eh
i
see
before
me
an
eternity
of
grinding
all
alone
by
yourself
in
this
dull
little
hole
you
be
conscientious
you
be
virtuous
oh
my
solitude
will
be
mitigated
i
shall
have
models
and
people
what
people
what
models
miriam
asked
as
she
arranged
her
hat
before
the
glass
well
no
one
so
good
as
you
that
a
prospect
the
girl
laughed
for
all
the
good
you
got
out
of
me
you
no
judge
of
that
quantity
said
nick
and
even
i
ca
measure
it
just
yet
have
i
been
rather
a
bore
and
a
brute
i
can
easily
believe
it
i
have
talked
to
you
i
have
amused
you
as
i
might
the
truth
is
that
taking
people
likenesses
is
a
very
absorbing
inhuman
occupation
you
ca
do
much
to
them
besides
yes
it
a
cruel
honour
to
pay
them
cruel
that
too
much
he
objected
i
mean
it
one
you
should
confer
on
those
you
like
for
when
over
it
over
it
kills
your
interest
in
them
after
you
finished
them
you
do
like
them
any
more
at
all
surely
i
like
nick
returned
sitting
tilted
back
before
his
picture
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
we
done
very
well
it
something
not
to
have
quarrelled
and
she
smiled
at
him
now
seeming
more
in
it
i
would
have
had
you
slight
your
work
i
would
have
had
you
do
it
badly
but
there
no
fear
of
that
for
you
she
went
on
you
the
real
thing
and
the
rare
bird
i
have
lived
with
you
this
way
without
seeing
that
you
the
sincere
artist
so
much
more
than
i
no
no
do
protest
she
added
with
one
of
her
sudden
fine
transitions
to
a
deeper
tone
you
do
things
that
will
hand
on
your
name
when
my
screeching
is
happily
over
only
you
do
seem
to
me
i
confess
rather
high
and
dry
here
i
speak
from
the
point
of
view
of
your
comfort
and
of
my
personal
interest
in
you
you
strike
me
as
kind
of
lonely
as
the
americans
say
rather
cut
off
and
isolated
in
your
grandeur
have
you
any
confrères
and
people
of
that
sort
do
they
come
near
you
i
do
know
them
much
nick
humbly
confessed
i
always
been
afraid
of
them
and
how
can
they
take
me
seriously
well
got
confrères
and
sometimes
i
wish
i
had
but
does
your
sister
never
come
near
you
any
more
she
asked
or
is
it
only
the
fear
of
meeting
me
he
was
aware
of
his
mother
theory
that
biddy
was
constantly
bundled
home
from
rosedale
road
at
the
approach
of
improper
persons
she
was
as
angry
at
this
as
if
she
would
have
been
more
so
had
her
child
suffered
exposure
but
the
explanation
he
gave
his
present
visitor
was
nearer
the
truth
he
reminded
her
that
he
had
already
told
her
he
had
been
careful
to
do
this
so
as
not
to
let
it
appear
she
was
avoided
that
his
sister
was
now
most
of
the
time
in
the
country
staying
with
an
hospitable
relation
oh
yes
the
girl
rejoined
to
this
with
sherringham
sister
what
her
name
i
always
forget
and
when
he
had
pronounced
the
word
with
a
reluctance
he
doubtless
failed
sufficiently
to
conceal
he
hated
to
talk
of
julia
by
any
name
and
did
know
what
business
miriam
had
with
her
she
went
on
that
the
one
the
beauty
the
wonderful
beauty
i
shall
never
forget
how
handsome
she
looked
the
day
she
found
me
here
i
do
in
the
least
resemble
her
but
i
should
like
to
have
a
try
at
that
type
some
day
in
a
comedy
of
manners
but
who
the
devil
will
write
me
a
comedy
of
manners
there
it
is
the
danger
would
be
no
doubt
that
i
should
push
her
la
nick
listened
to
these
remarks
in
silence
saying
to
himself
that
if
she
should
have
the
bad
taste
which
she
seemed
trembling
on
the
brink
of
to
make
an
allusion
to
what
had
passed
between
the
lady
in
question
and
himself
he
should
dislike
her
beyond
remedy
it
would
show
him
she
was
a
coarse
creature
after
all
her
good
genius
interposed
however
as
against
this
hard
penalty
and
she
quickly
for
the
moment
at
least
whisked
away
from
the
topic
demanding
since
they
spoke
of
comrades
and
visitors
what
had
become
of
gabriel
nash
whom
she
had
heard
of
for
so
many
days
i
think
he
tired
of
me
said
nick
he
has
been
near
me
either
but
after
all
it
natural
he
has
seen
me
through
seen
you
through
do
you
mean
she
laughed
seen
through
you
why
you
only
just
begun
precisely
and
at
bottom
he
does
like
to
see
me
begin
he
afraid
i
shall
do
something
she
wondered
as
with
the
interest
of
that
do
you
mean
he
jealous
not
in
the
least
for
from
the
moment
one
does
anything
one
ceases
to
compete
with
him
it
leaves
him
the
field
more
clear
but
that
just
the
discomfort
for
him
he
feels
as
you
said
just
now
kind
of
lonely
he
feels
rather
abandoned
and
even
i
think
a
little
betrayed
so
far
from
being
jealous
he
yearns
for
me
and
regrets
me
the
only
thing
he
really
takes
seriously
is
to
speculate
and
understand
to
talk
about
the
reasons
and
the
essence
of
things
the
people
who
do
that
are
the
highest
the
applications
the
consequences
the
vulgar
little
effects
belong
to
a
lower
plane
for
which
one
must
doubtless
be
tolerant
and
indulgent
but
which
is
after
all
an
affair
of
comparative
accidents
and
trifles
indeed
he
probably
tell
me
frankly
the
next
time
i
see
him
that
he
ca
but
feel
that
to
come
down
to
small
questions
of
action
to
the
small
prudences
and
compromises
and
simplifications
of
practice
is
for
the
superior
person
really
a
fatal
descent
one
may
be
inoffensive
and
even
commendable
after
it
but
one
can
scarcely
pretend
to
be
interesting
en
faut
comme
but
one
does
haunt
them
he
do
his
best
for
me
he
come
back
again
but
he
come
back
sad
and
finally
he
fade
away
altogether
hell
go
off
to
granada
or
somewhere
the
simplifications
of
practice
cried
miriam
why
they
just
precisely
the
most
blessed
things
on
earth
what
should
we
do
without
them
what
indeed
nick
echoed
but
if
we
need
them
it
because
we
not
superior
persons
we
awful
philistines
i
be
one
with
the
girl
smiled
poor
nash
is
worth
talking
about
what
was
it
but
a
small
question
of
action
when
he
preached
to
you
as
i
know
he
did
to
give
up
your
seat
yes
he
has
a
weakness
for
giving
up
he
go
with
you
as
far
as
that
but
i
not
giving
up
any
more
you
see
i
pegging
away
and
gross
he
an
idiot
parlons
she
dropped
gathering
up
her
parasol
but
lingering
ah
i
stick
to
him
nick
said
he
helped
me
at
a
difficult
time
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
confess
it
oh
you
a
philistine
nick
returned
certainly
i
am
she
declared
going
toward
the
door
if
it
makes
me
one
to
be
sorry
awfully
sorry
and
even
rather
angry
that
i
before
me
a
period
of
the
same
sort
of
unsociable
pegging
away
that
you
have
for
want
of
it
i
shall
never
really
be
good
however
if
you
tell
people
i
said
so
they
never
know
your
conditions
are
far
better
than
mine
and
far
more
respectable
you
can
do
as
many
things
as
you
like
in
patient
obscurity
while
i
pitchforked
into
the
and
into
the
most
improbable
fame
all
on
the
back
of
a
solitary
de
a
poor
screw
i
read
it
clear
that
i
shall
be
condemned
for
the
greater
part
of
the
rest
of
my
days
do
you
see
that
to
play
the
stuff
i
acting
now
i
studying
juliet
and
i
want
awfully
to
do
her
but
really
i
mortally
afraid
lest
making
a
success
of
her
i
should
find
myself
in
such
a
box
perhaps
the
brutes
would
want
juliet
for
ever
instead
of
my
present
part
you
see
amid
what
delightful
alternatives
one
moves
what
i
long
for
most
i
never
shall
have
had
five
quiet
years
of
hard
work
in
a
perfect
company
with
a
manager
more
perfect
still
playing
five
hundred
things
and
never
being
heard
of
at
all
i
may
be
too
particular
but
that
what
i
should
have
liked
i
think
i
disgusting
with
my
successful
crudities
discouraging
it
makes
one
not
care
much
what
happens
what
the
use
in
such
an
age
of
being
good
good
your
haughty
claim
nick
laughed
is
that
you
bad
i
mean
you
know
there
are
other
ways
do
be
stupid
and
miriam
tapped
him
he
was
near
her
at
the
door
with
her
parasol
i
scarcely
know
what
to
say
to
you
he
logically
pleaded
for
certainly
it
your
fault
if
you
get
on
so
fast
i
too
clever
i
a
humbug
that
the
way
i
used
to
be
said
nick
she
rested
her
brave
eyes
on
him
then
turned
them
over
the
room
slowly
after
which
she
attached
them
again
kindly
musingly
rather
as
if
he
had
been
a
fine
view
or
an
interesting
object
to
his
face
ah
the
pride
of
that
the
sense
of
purification
he
to
be
forsooth
poor
me
of
course
you
say
at
the
sort
of
thing
i
undertaken
to
produce
compared
with
the
rot
you
have
so
it
all
right
become
great
in
the
proper
way
and
do
expose
me
she
glanced
back
once
more
at
the
studio
as
if
to
leave
it
for
ever
and
gave
another
last
look
at
the
unfinished
canvas
on
the
easel
she
shook
her
head
sadly
poor
sherringham
with
she
wailed
oh
i
finish
it
it
will
be
very
decent
nick
said
finish
it
by
yourself
not
necessarily
you
come
back
and
sit
when
you
return
to
london
never
never
never
again
he
wondered
why
you
made
me
the
most
profuse
offers
and
promises
yes
but
they
were
made
in
ignorance
and
i
backed
out
of
them
capricious
too
la
part
de
i
see
it
would
do
i
know
it
then
we
too
far
apart
i
as
you
say
a
philistine
and
as
he
protested
with
vehemence
against
this
unscrupulous
bad
faith
she
added
you
find
other
models
paint
gabriel
nash
gabriel
nash
as
a
substitute
for
you
it
will
be
a
good
way
to
get
rid
of
him
paint
dallow
too
miriam
went
on
as
she
passed
out
of
the
door
he
had
opened
for
her
paint
dallow
if
you
wish
to
eradicate
the
last
possibility
of
a
throb
it
was
strange
that
since
only
a
moment
before
he
had
been
in
a
state
of
mind
to
which
the
superfluity
of
this
reference
would
have
been
the
clearest
thing
about
it
he
should
now
have
been
moved
to
receive
it
quickly
naturally
irreflectively
receive
it
with
the
question
the
last
possibility
do
you
mean
in
her
or
in
me
oh
in
you
i
do
know
anything
about
but
that
would
be
the
effect
he
argued
with
the
same
supervening
candour
i
believe
that
if
she
were
to
sit
to
me
the
usual
law
would
be
reversed
the
usual
law
which
you
cited
a
while
since
and
of
which
i
recognised
the
general
truth
in
the
case
you
speak
of
he
said
i
should
probably
make
a
shocking
picture
and
fall
in
love
with
her
again
then
for
god
sake
risk
the
daub
miriam
laughed
out
as
she
floated
away
to
her
victoria
xlix
she
had
guessed
happily
in
saying
to
him
that
to
offer
to
paint
gabriel
nash
would
be
the
way
to
get
rid
of
that
visitant
it
was
with
no
such
invidious
purpose
indeed
that
our
young
man
proposed
to
his
intermittent
friend
to
sit
rather
as
august
was
dusty
in
the
london
streets
he
had
too
little
hope
that
nash
would
remain
in
town
at
such
a
time
to
oblige
him
nick
had
no
wish
to
get
rid
of
his
private
philosopher
he
liked
his
philosophy
and
though
of
course
premeditated
paradox
was
the
light
to
read
him
by
he
yet
had
frequently
and
incidentally
an
inspired
unexpectedness
he
remained
in
rosedale
road
the
man
who
most
produced
by
his
presence
the
effect
of
company
all
the
other
men
of
acquaintance
all
his
political
friends
represented
often
very
communicatively
their
own
affairs
their
own
affairs
alone
which
when
they
did
it
well
was
the
most
their
host
could
ask
of
them
but
nash
had
the
rare
distinction
that
he
seemed
somehow
to
figure
affairs
the
said
host
and
to
show
an
interest
in
them
unaffected
by
the
ordinary
social
limitations
of
capacity
this
relegated
him
to
the
class
of
high
luxuries
and
nick
was
well
aware
that
we
hold
our
luxuries
by
a
fitful
and
precarious
tenure
if
a
friend
without
personal
eagerness
was
one
of
the
greatest
of
these
it
would
be
evident
to
the
simplest
mind
that
by
the
law
of
distribution
of
earthly
boons
such
a
convenience
should
be
expected
to
forfeit
in
duration
what
it
displayed
in
intensity
he
had
never
been
without
a
suspicion
that
nash
was
too
good
to
last
though
for
that
matter
nothing
had
yet
confirmed
a
vague
apprehension
that
his
particular
manner
of
breaking
up
or
breaking
down
would
be
by
his
wishing
to
put
so
fresh
a
recruit
in
relation
with
other
disciples
that
would
practically
amount
to
a
catastrophe
nick
felt
for
it
was
odd
that
one
could
both
have
a
great
kindness
for
him
and
not
in
the
least
when
it
came
to
the
point
yearn
for
a
view
of
his
personal
extensions
his
originality
had
always
been
that
he
appeared
to
have
none
and
if
in
the
first
instance
he
had
introduced
his
bright
young
political
prodigy
to
miriam
and
her
mother
that
was
an
exception
for
which
peter
sherringham
interference
had
been
mainly
responsible
all
the
same
however
it
was
some
time
before
nick
ceased
to
view
it
as
perhaps
on
the
awkward
books
that
to
complete
his
education
as
it
were
gabriel
would
wish
him
to
converse
a
little
with
spirits
formed
by
a
like
tonic
discipline
nick
had
an
instinct
in
which
there
was
no
consciousness
of
detriment
to
nash
that
the
pupils
possibly
even
the
imitators
of
such
a
genius
would
be
as
he
mentally
phrased
it
something
awful
he
could
be
sure
even
gabriel
himself
could
be
sure
of
his
own
reservations
but
how
could
either
of
them
be
sure
of
those
of
others
imitation
is
a
fortunate
homage
only
in
proportion
as
it
rests
on
measurements
and
there
was
an
indefinable
something
in
doctrine
that
would
have
been
discredited
by
exaggeration
or
by
zeal
providence
happily
appeared
to
have
spared
it
this
ordeal
so
that
nick
had
after
months
still
to
remind
himself
how
his
friend
had
never
pressed
on
his
attention
the
least
little
group
of
never
offered
to
produce
them
for
his
edification
it
scarcely
mattered
now
that
he
was
just
the
man
to
whom
the
superficial
would
attribute
that
sort
of
tail
it
would
probably
have
been
hard
for
example
to
persuade
lady
agnes
or
julia
dallow
or
peter
sherringham
that
he
was
not
most
at
home
in
some
dusky
untidy
suburb
of
culture
a
region
peopled
by
unpleasant
phrasemongers
who
thought
him
a
gentleman
and
who
had
no
human
use
but
to
be
held
up
in
the
comic
press
which
was
moreover
probably
restrained
by
decorum
from
touching
upon
the
worst
of
their
aberrations
nick
at
any
rate
never
ran
his
academy
to
earth
nor
so
much
as
skirted
the
suburb
in
question
never
caught
from
the
impenetrable
background
of
his
life
the
least
reverberation
of
flitting
or
of
flirting
the
fainting
esthetic
ululation
there
had
been
moments
when
he
was
even
moved
to
anxiety
by
the
silence
that
poor
gabriel
own
faculty
of
sound
made
all
about
him
when
at
least
it
reduced
to
plainer
elements
the
mere
bald
terms
of
lonely
singleness
and
thrift
of
the
lean
philosophic
life
the
mystery
he
could
never
wholly
dissociate
from
him
the
air
as
of
the
transient
and
occasional
the
likeness
to
curling
vapour
or
murmuring
wind
or
shifting
light
it
was
for
instance
a
symbol
of
this
unclassified
state
the
lack
of
all
position
as
a
name
in
cited
lists
that
nick
in
point
of
fact
had
no
idea
where
he
lived
would
not
have
known
how
to
go
and
see
him
or
send
him
a
doctor
if
he
had
heard
he
was
ill
he
had
never
walked
with
him
to
any
door
of
gabriel
own
even
to
pause
at
the
threshold
though
indeed
nash
had
a
club
the
anonymous
in
some
improbable
square
of
which
he
might
be
suspected
of
being
the
only
member
one
had
never
heard
of
another
where
it
was
vaguely
understood
letters
would
some
day
or
other
find
him
fortunately
he
pressed
with
no
sharpness
the
spring
of
pity
his
whole
form
was
so
easy
a
grasp
of
the
helm
of
consciousness
which
he
would
never
let
go
he
would
never
consent
to
any
deformity
but
would
steer
his
course
straight
through
the
eventual
narrow
pass
and
simply
go
down
over
the
horizon
he
in
any
case
turned
up
rosedale
road
one
day
after
miriam
had
left
london
he
had
just
come
back
from
a
fortnight
in
brittany
where
he
had
drawn
refreshment
from
the
tragic
sweetness
of
well
of
everything
he
was
on
his
way
somewhere
else
was
going
abroad
for
the
autumn
but
was
not
particular
what
he
did
professing
that
he
had
come
back
just
to
get
nick
utterly
off
his
mind
it
very
nice
it
very
nice
yes
yes
i
see
he
remarked
giving
a
little
general
assenting
sigh
as
his
eyes
wandered
over
the
simple
scene
a
sigh
which
for
a
suspicious
ear
would
have
testified
to
an
insidious
reaction
nick
ear
as
we
know
was
already
suspicious
a
fact
accounting
for
the
expectant
smile
it
indicated
the
pleasant
apprehension
of
a
theory
confirmed
with
which
he
returned
do
you
mean
my
pictures
are
nice
yes
yes
your
pictures
and
the
whole
thing
the
whole
thing
your
existence
in
this
little
remote
independent
corner
of
the
great
city
the
disinterestedness
of
your
attitude
the
persistence
of
your
effort
the
piety
the
beauty
in
short
the
edification
of
the
whole
spectacle
nick
laughed
a
little
ruefully
how
near
to
having
had
enough
of
me
you
must
be
when
you
speak
of
me
as
edifying
nash
changed
colour
slightly
at
this
it
was
the
first
time
in
his
friend
remembrance
that
he
had
given
a
sign
of
embarrassment
allez
me
i
see
it
coming
and
who
can
blame
you
for
i
ceased
to
be
in
the
least
spectacular
i
had
my
little
hour
it
was
a
great
deal
for
some
people
do
even
have
that
i
given
you
your
curious
case
and
i
been
generous
i
made
the
drama
last
for
you
as
long
as
i
could
you
my
dear
fellow
you
quietly
slope
and
it
will
be
all
right
and
inevitable
though
i
shall
miss
you
greatly
at
first
who
knows
whether
without
you
i
should
still
have
been
harsh
heaven
help
me
you
rescued
me
you
converted
me
from
a
representative
into
an
example
that
a
shade
better
but
do
i
know
where
you
must
be
when
you
reduced
to
praising
my
piety
do
turn
me
away
said
nash
plaintively
give
me
a
cigarette
i
shall
never
dream
of
turning
you
away
i
shall
cherish
you
till
the
latest
possible
hour
i
only
trying
to
keep
myself
in
tune
with
the
logic
of
things
the
proof
of
how
i
cling
is
that
precisely
i
want
you
to
sit
to
me
to
sit
to
you
with
which
nick
could
fancy
his
visitor
a
little
blank
certainly
for
after
all
it
is
much
to
ask
here
we
are
and
the
hour
peculiarly
propitious
long
light
days
with
no
one
coming
near
me
so
that
i
plenty
of
time
i
had
a
hope
i
should
have
some
orders
my
younger
sister
whom
you
know
and
who
a
great
optimist
plied
me
with
that
vision
in
fact
we
invented
together
a
charming
little
sordid
theory
that
there
might
be
rather
a
on
me
from
the
chatter
such
as
it
was
produced
by
my
taking
up
this
line
my
sister
struck
out
the
idea
that
a
good
many
of
the
pretty
ladies
would
think
me
interesting
and
would
want
to
be
done
perhaps
they
do
but
they
controlled
themselves
for
i
ca
say
the
run
has
commenced
they
have
even
come
to
look
but
i
daresay
they
do
yet
quite
take
it
in
of
course
it
a
bad
time
with
every
one
out
of
town
though
you
know
they
might
send
for
me
to
come
and
do
them
at
home
perhaps
they
will
when
they
settle
down
a
of
a
dozen
for
the
autumn
and
winter
what
do
you
say
to
that
for
the
ardent
life
i
know
i
excruciate
you
nick
added
but
do
you
see
how
it
in
my
interest
to
try
how
much
you
still
stand
gabriel
puffed
his
cigarette
with
a
serenity
so
perfect
that
it
might
have
been
assumed
to
falsify
these
words
dallow
will
send
for
you
allez
voir
he
said
in
a
moment
brushing
aside
all
vagueness
she
send
for
me
to
paint
her
portrait
she
recapture
you
on
that
basis
she
get
you
down
to
one
of
the
and
it
will
all
go
off
as
charmingly
with
sketching
in
the
morning
on
days
you
ca
hunt
and
anything
you
like
in
the
afternoon
and
fifteen
courses
in
the
evening
there
be
bishops
and
ambassadors
staying
as
if
you
were
a
awfully
clever
amateur
take
care
take
care
for
fickle
as
you
may
think
me
i
can
read
the
future
do
imagine
you
come
to
the
end
of
me
yet
dallow
and
your
sister
of
both
of
whom
i
speak
with
the
greatest
respect
are
capable
of
hatching
together
the
most
conscientious
delightful
plan
for
you
your
differences
with
the
beautiful
lady
will
be
patched
up
and
you
each
come
round
a
little
and
meet
the
other
halfway
the
beautiful
lady
will
swallow
your
profession
if
you
swallow
hers
she
put
up
with
the
palette
if
you
put
up
with
the
it
will
be
a
very
unusual
one
in
which
you
wo
find
a
good
north
room
where
you
can
paint
you
go
about
with
her
and
do
all
her
friends
all
the
bishops
and
ambassadors
and
you
eat
your
cake
and
have
it
and
every
one
beginning
with
your
wife
will
forget
there
anything
queer
about
you
and
everything
will
be
for
the
best
in
the
best
of
worlds
so
that
together
you
and
she
you
become
a
great
social
institution
and
every
one
will
think
she
has
a
delightful
husband
to
say
nothing
of
course
of
your
having
a
delightful
wife
ah
my
dear
fellow
you
turn
pale
and
with
reason
nash
went
lucidly
on
that
to
pay
you
for
having
tried
to
make
me
let
you
have
it
you
have
it
then
there
i
may
be
a
bore
the
emphasis
of
this
though
a
mere
shade
testified
to
the
first
personal
resentment
nick
had
ever
heard
his
visitor
express
i
may
be
a
bore
but
once
in
a
while
i
strike
a
light
i
make
things
out
then
i
venture
to
repeat
care
take
care
if
as
i
say
i
respect
infinitely
it
because
they
will
be
acting
according
to
the
highest
wisdom
of
their
sex
that
the
sort
of
thing
women
do
for
a
man
the
sort
of
thing
they
invent
when
they
exceptionally
good
and
clever
when
they
not
they
do
do
so
well
but
it
not
for
want
of
trying
there
only
one
thing
in
the
world
better
than
their
incomparable
charm
it
their
abysmal
conscience
deep
calleth
unto
deep
the
indeed
a
part
of
the
other
and
when
they
club
together
when
they
earnestly
consider
as
in
the
case
we
supposing
nash
continued
then
the
whole
thing
takes
a
lift
for
it
no
longer
the
virtue
of
the
individual
it
that
of
the
wondrous
sex
you
so
remarkable
that
more
than
ever
i
must
paint
you
nick
returned
though
i
so
agitated
by
your
prophetic
words
that
my
hand
trembles
and
i
shall
doubtless
scarcely
be
able
to
hold
my
brush
look
how
i
rattle
my
easel
trying
to
put
it
into
position
i
see
it
all
there
just
as
you
show
it
yes
it
will
be
a
droll
day
and
more
modern
than
anything
yet
when
the
conscience
of
women
makes
out
good
reasons
for
men
not
being
in
love
with
them
you
talk
of
their
goodness
and
cleverness
and
it
certainly
much
to
the
point
i
do
know
what
else
they
themselves
might
do
with
those
graces
but
i
do
see
what
man
can
do
with
them
but
be
fond
of
them
where
he
finds
them
oh
you
do
it
you
do
it
cried
nash
brightly
jubilant
what
is
it
i
shall
do
exactly
what
i
just
said
if
not
next
year
then
the
year
after
or
the
year
after
that
you
go
halfway
to
meet
her
and
she
drag
you
about
and
pass
you
off
you
paint
the
bishops
and
become
a
social
institution
that
is
you
do
it
if
you
do
take
great
care
i
shall
no
doubt
and
that
why
i
cling
to
you
you
must
still
look
after
me
nick
went
on
do
melt
away
into
a
mere
improbable
reminiscence
a
delightful
symbolic
fable
do
if
you
can
possibly
help
it
the
trouble
is
you
see
that
you
ca
really
keep
hold
very
tight
because
at
bottom
it
will
amuse
you
much
more
to
see
me
in
another
pickle
than
to
find
me
simply
jogging
down
the
vista
of
the
years
on
the
straight
course
let
me
at
any
rate
have
some
sort
of
sketch
of
you
as
a
kind
of
feather
from
the
angel
wing
or
a
photograph
of
the
ghost
to
prove
to
me
in
the
future
that
you
were
once
a
solid
sociable
fact
that
i
did
invent
you
did
launch
you
as
a
deadly
hoax
of
course
i
shall
be
able
to
say
to
myself
that
you
ca
have
been
a
fable
otherwise
you
have
a
moral
but
that
wo
be
enough
because
i
not
sure
you
wo
have
had
one
some
day
you
peep
in
here
languidly
and
find
me
in
such
an
attitude
of
piety
presenting
my
bent
back
to
you
as
i
niggle
over
some
interminable
botch
that
i
shall
give
cruelly
on
your
nerves
and
you
just
draw
away
closing
the
door
softly
you
be
gentle
and
considerate
about
it
and
spare
me
you
wo
even
make
me
look
round
you
steal
off
on
tiptoe
never
never
to
return
gabriel
consented
to
sit
he
professed
he
should
enjoy
it
and
be
glad
to
give
up
for
it
his
immediate
foreign
commerce
so
vague
to
nick
so
definite
apparently
to
himself
and
he
came
back
three
times
for
the
purpose
nick
promised
himself
a
deal
of
interest
from
this
experiment
for
with
the
first
hour
of
it
he
began
to
feel
that
really
as
yet
given
the
conditions
under
which
he
now
studied
him
he
had
never
at
all
thoroughly
explored
his
friend
his
impression
had
been
that
nash
had
a
head
quite
fine
enough
to
be
a
challenge
and
that
as
he
sat
there
day
by
day
all
sorts
of
pleasant
and
paintable
things
would
come
out
in
his
face
this
impression
was
not
gainsaid
but
the
whole
tangle
grew
denser
it
struck
our
young
man
that
he
had
never
his
subject
before
and
yet
somehow
this
revelation
was
not
produced
by
the
sense
of
actually
seeing
it
what
was
revealed
was
the
difficulty
what
he
saw
was
not
the
measurable
mask
but
the
ambiguous
meaning
he
had
taken
things
for
granted
which
literally
were
not
there
and
he
found
things
there
except
that
he
could
catch
them
which
he
had
not
hitherto
counted
in
or
presumed
to
handle
this
baffling
effect
eminently
in
the
line
of
the
mystifying
so
familiar
to
nash
might
have
been
the
result
of
his
whimsical
volition
had
it
not
appeared
to
our
artist
after
a
few
hours
of
the
job
that
his
sitter
was
not
the
one
who
enjoyed
it
most
he
was
uncomfortable
at
first
vaguely
and
then
definitely
so
silent
restless
gloomy
dim
as
if
on
the
test
the
homage
of
a
directer
attention
than
he
had
ever
had
gave
him
less
pleasure
than
he
would
have
supposed
he
had
been
willing
to
judge
of
this
in
good
faith
but
frankly
he
rather
suffered
he
was
cross
but
was
clearly
unhappy
and
nick
had
never
before
felt
him
contract
instead
of
expanding
it
was
all
accordingly
as
if
a
trap
had
been
laid
for
him
and
our
young
man
asked
himself
if
it
were
really
fair
at
the
same
time
there
was
something
richly
rare
in
such
a
relation
between
the
subject
and
the
artist
and
nick
was
disposed
to
go
on
till
he
should
have
to
stop
for
pity
or
for
shame
he
caught
eventually
a
glimmer
of
the
truth
underlying
the
strangeness
guessed
that
what
upset
his
friend
was
simply
the
reversal
in
such
a
combination
of
his
usual
terms
of
intercourse
he
was
so
accustomed
to
living
upon
irony
and
the
interpretation
of
things
that
it
was
new
to
him
to
be
himself
interpreted
and
as
a
gentleman
who
sits
for
his
portrait
is
always
liable
to
be
interpreted
all
ironically
from
being
outside
of
the
universe
he
was
suddenly
brought
into
it
and
from
the
position
of
a
free
commentator
and
critic
an
easy
amateurish
editor
of
the
whole
affair
reduced
to
that
of
humble
ingredient
and
contributor
it
occurred
afterwards
to
nick
that
he
had
perhaps
brought
on
a
catastrophe
by
having
happened
to
throw
off
as
they
gossiped
or
languished
and
not
alone
without
a
cruel
intention
but
with
an
impulse
of
genuine
solicitude
but
my
dear
fellow
what
will
you
do
when
you
old
old
what
do
you
call
old
nash
had
replied
bravely
enough
but
with
another
perceptible
tinge
of
irritation
must
i
really
remind
you
at
this
time
of
day
that
that
term
has
no
application
to
such
a
condition
as
mine
it
only
belongs
to
you
wretched
people
who
have
the
incurable
superstition
of
it
the
ignoble
collapse
you
prepare
for
yourselves
when
you
cease
to
be
able
to
do
for
me
there
be
no
collapse
no
transition
no
clumsy
readjustment
of
attitude
for
i
shall
only
more
and
more
with
all
the
accumulations
of
experience
the
longer
i
live
oh
i
not
particular
about
the
term
said
nick
if
you
do
call
it
old
the
ultimate
state
call
it
weary
call
it
final
the
accumulations
of
experience
are
practically
accumulations
of
fatigue
i
do
know
anything
about
weariness
i
live
freshly
it
fatigue
me
then
you
need
never
die
nick
declared
certainly
i
daresay
i
indestructible
immortal
nick
laughed
out
at
this
it
would
be
such
fine
news
to
some
people
but
it
was
uttered
with
perfect
gravity
and
it
might
very
well
have
been
in
the
spirit
of
that
gravity
that
nash
failed
to
observe
his
agreement
to
sit
again
the
next
day
the
next
and
the
next
and
the
next
passed
but
he
never
came
back
true
enough
punctuality
was
not
important
for
a
man
who
felt
that
he
had
the
command
of
all
time
nevertheless
his
disappearance
without
a
trace
that
of
a
personage
in
a
or
a
melodrama
made
a
considerable
impression
on
his
friend
as
the
months
went
on
so
that
though
he
had
never
before
had
the
least
difficulty
about
entering
into
the
play
of
gabriel
humour
nick
now
recalled
with
a
certain
fanciful
awe
the
special
accent
with
which
he
had
ranked
himself
among
imperishable
things
he
wondered
a
little
if
he
had
at
last
balancing
always
on
the
stretched
of
his
wit
fallen
over
on
the
wrong
side
he
had
never
before
of
a
truth
been
so
nearly
witless
and
would
have
to
have
gone
mad
in
short
to
become
so
singularly
simple
perhaps
indeed
he
was
acting
only
more
than
usual
in
his
customary
spirit
thoughtfully
contributing
for
nick
enlivenment
a
purple
rim
of
mystery
to
an
horizon
now
so
dreadfully
let
down
the
mystery
at
any
rate
remained
another
shade
of
purple
in
fact
was
virtually
added
to
it
nick
had
the
prospect
for
the
future
of
waiting
to
see
all
curiously
when
nash
would
turn
up
if
ever
and
the
further
diversion
it
almost
consoled
him
for
the
annoyance
of
being
left
with
a
second
unfinished
thing
on
his
hands
of
imagining
in
the
portrait
he
had
begun
an
odd
tendency
to
fade
gradually
from
the
canvas
he
catch
it
in
the
act
but
he
could
have
ever
a
suspicion
on
glancing
at
it
that
the
hand
of
time
was
rubbing
it
away
little
by
little
for
all
the
world
as
in
some
delicate
hawthorne
tale
and
making
the
surface
indistinct
and
bare
of
all
resemblance
to
the
model
of
course
the
moral
of
the
hawthorne
tale
would
be
that
his
personage
would
come
back
in
quaint
confidence
on
the
day
his
last
projected
shadow
should
have
vanished
l
one
day
toward
the
end
of
march
of
the
following
year
in
other
words
more
than
six
months
after
nash
disappearance
bridget
dormer
came
into
her
brother
studio
and
greeted
him
with
the
effusion
that
accompanies
a
return
from
an
absence
she
had
been
staying
at
broadwood
she
had
been
staying
at
harsh
she
had
various
things
to
tell
him
about
these
episodes
about
his
mother
about
grace
about
her
small
subterraneous
self
and
about
percy
having
come
just
before
over
to
broadwood
for
two
days
the
longest
visit
with
which
almost
since
they
could
remember
the
head
of
the
family
had
honoured
their
common
parent
nick
noted
indeed
that
this
demonstration
had
apparently
been
taken
as
a
great
favour
and
biddy
loyally
testified
to
the
fact
that
her
elder
brother
was
awfully
jolly
and
that
his
presence
had
been
a
pretext
for
tremendous
fun
nick
accordingly
asked
her
what
had
passed
about
his
marriage
what
their
mother
had
said
to
him
oh
nothing
she
replied
and
percy
had
said
nothing
to
lady
agnes
and
not
a
word
to
herself
this
partly
explained
for
his
junior
the
consequent
beatitude
none
but
cheerful
topics
had
been
produced
but
he
questioned
the
girl
further
to
a
point
which
led
her
to
say
oh
i
daresay
that
before
long
she
write
to
her
who
write
to
whom
mamma
write
to
percy
wife
i
sure
he
like
it
of
course
we
shall
end
by
going
to
see
her
he
was
awfully
disappointed
at
what
he
found
in
spain
he
did
find
anything
biddy
spoke
of
his
disappointment
almost
with
commiseration
for
she
was
evidently
inclined
this
morning
to
a
fresh
and
kindly
view
of
things
nick
could
share
her
feeling
but
so
far
as
was
permitted
by
a
recognition
merely
general
of
what
his
brother
must
have
looked
for
it
might
have
been
snipe
and
it
might
have
been
bristling
boars
biddy
was
indeed
brief
at
first
about
everything
in
spite
of
all
the
weeks
that
had
gone
since
their
last
meeting
for
he
quickly
enough
saw
she
had
something
behind
something
that
made
her
gay
and
that
she
wanted
to
come
to
quickly
he
was
vaguely
vexed
at
her
being
fresh
from
broadwood
so
gay
as
that
for
it
was
impossible
to
shut
one
eyes
to
the
fact
what
had
practically
come
to
pass
in
regard
to
that
rural
retreat
was
exactly
what
he
had
desired
to
avert
all
winter
while
it
had
been
taken
for
granted
his
mother
and
sisters
were
doing
what
he
wished
they
had
been
doing
precisely
what
he
hated
he
held
biddy
perhaps
least
responsible
and
there
was
no
one
he
could
exclusively
blame
he
washed
his
hands
of
the
matter
and
succeeded
fairly
well
for
the
most
part
in
forgetting
he
was
not
pleased
julia
herself
in
truth
appeared
to
have
been
the
most
active
member
of
the
little
group
united
to
make
light
of
his
decencies
there
had
been
a
formal
restitution
of
broadwood
but
the
three
ladies
were
there
more
than
ever
with
the
slight
difference
that
they
were
mainly
there
with
its
mistress
mahomet
had
declined
to
go
any
more
to
the
mountain
so
the
mountain
had
virtually
come
to
mahomet
after
their
long
visit
in
the
autumn
lady
agnes
and
her
girls
had
come
back
to
town
but
they
had
gone
down
again
for
christmas
and
julia
had
taken
this
occasion
to
write
to
nick
that
she
hoped
very
much
he
would
refuse
them
all
his
own
company
for
just
a
little
scrap
of
the
supremely
sociable
time
nick
after
reflexion
judged
it
best
not
to
refuse
so
that
he
passed
in
the
event
four
days
under
his
roof
the
all
proved
a
great
many
people
for
she
had
taken
care
to
fill
the
house
she
took
the
largest
view
of
hospitality
and
nick
had
never
seen
her
so
splendid
so
so
gracefully
active
she
was
a
perfect
mistress
of
the
revels
she
had
arranged
some
ancient
bravery
for
every
day
and
for
every
night
the
dormers
were
so
much
in
it
as
the
phrase
was
that
after
all
their
discomfiture
their
fortune
seemed
in
an
hour
to
have
come
back
there
had
been
a
moment
when
in
extemporised
charades
lady
agnes
an
elderly
figure
being
required
appeared
on
the
point
of
undertaking
the
part
of
the
housekeeper
at
a
castle
who
dropping
her
showed
sheeplike
tourists
about
but
she
waived
the
opportunity
in
favour
of
her
daughter
grace
even
grace
had
a
great
success
grace
dropped
her
as
with
the
crash
of
empires
nick
of
course
was
in
the
charades
and
in
everything
but
julia
was
not
she
only
invented
directed
led
the
applause
when
nothing
else
was
forward
nick
sketched
the
whole
company
they
followed
him
about
they
waylaid
him
on
staircases
clamouring
to
be
allowed
to
sit
he
obliged
them
so
far
as
he
could
all
save
julia
who
did
clamour
and
growing
rather
red
he
thought
of
gabriel
nash
while
he
bent
over
the
paper
early
in
the
new
year
he
went
abroad
for
six
weeks
but
only
as
far
as
paris
it
was
a
new
paris
for
him
then
a
paris
of
the
rue
bonaparte
and
three
or
four
professional
friends
he
had
more
of
these
there
than
in
london
a
paris
of
studios
and
studies
and
models
of
researches
and
revelations
comparisons
and
contrasts
of
strong
impressions
and
long
discussions
and
rather
uncomfortable
economies
small
cafés
bad
fires
and
the
general
sense
of
being
twenty
again
while
he
was
away
his
mother
and
sisters
lady
agnes
now
sometimes
wrote
to
him
returned
to
london
for
a
month
and
before
he
was
again
established
in
rosedale
road
they
went
back
for
a
third
course
of
broadwood
after
they
had
been
there
five
days
and
this
was
the
salt
of
the
whole
feast
julia
took
herself
off
to
harsh
leaving
them
in
undisturbed
possession
they
had
remained
so
they
would
come
up
to
town
till
after
easter
the
trick
was
played
and
biddy
as
i
have
mentioned
was
now
very
content
her
brother
presently
learned
however
that
the
reason
of
this
was
not
wholly
the
success
of
the
trick
unless
indeed
her
further
ground
were
only
a
continuation
of
it
she
was
not
in
london
as
a
forerunner
of
her
mother
she
was
not
even
as
yet
in
calcutta
gardens
she
had
come
to
spend
a
week
with
florry
tressilian
who
had
lately
taken
the
dearest
little
flat
in
a
charming
new
place
just
put
up
on
the
other
side
of
the
park
with
all
kinds
of
lifts
and
tubes
and
electricities
florry
had
been
awfully
nice
to
her
had
been
with
them
ever
so
long
at
broadwood
while
the
flat
was
being
painted
and
prepared
and
mamma
had
then
let
her
let
biddy
promise
to
come
to
her
when
everything
was
ready
so
that
they
might
have
a
happy
old
for
they
old
maids
now
together
if
florry
could
by
this
time
do
without
a
chaperon
she
had
two
latchkeys
and
went
alone
on
the
top
of
omnibuses
and
her
name
was
in
the
red
book
she
was
enough
of
a
duenna
for
another
girl
biddy
referred
with
sweet
cynical
eyes
to
the
fine
happy
stride
she
had
thus
taken
in
the
direction
of
enlightened
spinsterhood
and
nick
hung
his
head
immensely
abashed
and
humiliated
for
modern
as
he
had
fatuously
supposed
himself
there
were
evidently
currents
more
modern
yet
it
so
happened
that
on
this
particular
morning
he
had
drawn
out
of
a
corner
his
interrupted
study
of
gabriel
nash
on
no
further
curiosity
he
had
only
been
looking
round
the
room
in
a
rummaging
spirit
than
to
see
how
much
or
how
little
of
it
remained
it
had
become
to
his
view
so
dim
an
adumbration
he
was
sure
of
this
and
it
pressed
some
spring
of
melancholy
mirth
that
it
did
seem
worth
putting
away
and
he
left
it
leaning
against
a
table
as
if
it
had
been
a
blank
canvas
or
a
preparation
to
be
painted
over
in
this
posture
it
attracted
biddy
attention
for
on
a
second
glance
it
showed
distinguishable
features
she
had
not
seen
it
before
and
now
asked
whom
it
might
represent
remarking
also
that
she
could
almost
guess
yet
not
quite
she
had
known
the
original
but
could
name
him
six
months
ago
for
a
few
days
it
represented
gabriel
nash
nick
replied
but
it
is
anybody
or
anything
now
six
months
ago
what
the
matter
with
it
and
why
do
you
go
on
what
the
matter
with
it
is
more
than
i
can
tell
you
but
i
ca
go
on
because
i
lost
my
model
she
had
an
almost
hopeful
stare
is
he
beautifully
dead
her
brother
laughed
out
at
the
candid
cheerfulness
hopefulness
almost
with
which
this
inquiry
broke
from
her
he
only
dead
to
me
he
has
gone
away
where
has
he
gone
i
have
the
least
idea
why
have
you
quarrelled
biddy
shone
again
quarrelled
for
what
do
you
take
us
docs
the
nightingale
quarrel
with
the
moon
i
need
ask
which
of
you
is
the
moon
she
said
of
course
i
the
nightingale
but
more
literally
nick
continued
nash
has
melted
back
into
the
elements
he
part
of
the
great
air
of
the
world
and
then
as
even
with
this
lucidity
he
saw
the
girl
still
mystified
i
a
notion
he
has
gone
to
india
and
at
the
present
moment
is
reclining
on
a
bank
of
flowers
in
the
vale
of
cashmere
biddy
had
a
pause
after
which
she
dropped
julia
will
be
glad
she
dislikes
him
so
if
she
dislikes
him
why
should
she
be
glad
he
so
enviably
placed
i
mean
about
his
going
away
she
be
glad
of
that
my
poor
incorrigible
child
nick
cried
what
has
julia
to
do
with
it
she
has
more
to
do
with
things
than
you
think
biddy
returned
with
all
her
bravery
yet
she
had
no
sooner
uttered
the
words
than
she
perceptibly
blushed
hereupon
to
attenuate
the
foolishness
of
her
blush
only
it
had
the
opposite
effect
she
added
she
thinks
he
has
been
a
bad
element
in
your
life
nick
emitted
a
long
strange
sound
she
thinks
perhaps
but
she
think
enough
otherwise
she
arrive
at
this
better
thought
that
she
knows
nothing
whatever
about
my
life
ah
brother
the
girl
pleaded
with
solemn
eyes
you
do
imagine
what
an
interest
she
takes
in
it
she
has
told
me
many
times
she
has
talked
lots
to
me
about
it
biddy
paused
and
then
went
on
an
anxious
little
smile
shining
through
her
gravity
as
if
from
a
cautious
wonder
as
to
how
much
he
would
take
she
has
a
conviction
it
was
nash
who
made
trouble
between
you
best
of
little
sisters
nick
pronounced
those
are
thoroughly
ideas
the
result
of
a
perfectly
superficial
view
excuse
my
possibly
priggish
tone
but
they
really
attribute
to
my
dear
detached
friend
a
part
he
quite
incapable
of
playing
he
can
neither
make
trouble
nor
take
trouble
no
trouble
could
ever
either
have
come
out
of
him
or
have
got
into
him
moreover
our
young
man
continued
if
julia
has
talked
to
you
so
much
about
the
matter
there
no
harm
in
my
talking
to
you
a
little
when
she
threw
me
over
in
an
hour
it
was
on
a
perfectly
definite
occasion
that
occasion
was
the
presence
in
my
studio
of
a
dishevelled
an
abandoned
actress
oh
nick
she
has
not
thrown
you
over
biddy
protested
she
has
not
i
proof
he
felt
at
this
direct
denial
a
certain
stir
of
indignation
and
looked
at
the
girl
with
momentary
sternness
has
she
sent
you
here
to
tell
me
this
what
do
you
mean
by
proof
biddy
eyes
at
these
questions
met
her
brother
with
a
strange
expression
and
for
a
few
seconds
while
she
looked
entreatingly
into
them
she
wavered
there
with
parted
lips
and
vaguely
stretched
out
her
hands
the
next
minute
she
had
burst
into
tears
she
was
sobbing
on
his
breast
he
said
hallo
and
soothed
her
but
it
was
very
quickly
over
then
she
told
him
what
she
meant
by
her
proof
and
what
she
had
had
on
her
mind
ever
since
her
present
arrival
it
was
a
message
from
julia
but
not
to
say
not
to
say
what
he
had
questioned
her
about
just
before
though
indeed
more
familiar
now
that
he
had
his
arm
round
her
she
boldly
expressed
the
hope
it
might
in
the
end
come
to
the
same
thing
julia
simply
wanted
to
know
she
had
instructed
her
to
sound
him
discreetly
if
nick
would
undertake
her
portrait
and
she
wound
up
this
experiment
in
sounding
by
the
statement
that
their
beautiful
kinswoman
was
dying
to
sit
dying
to
sit
echoed
nick
whose
turn
it
was
this
time
to
feel
his
colour
rise
at
any
moment
you
like
after
easter
when
she
comes
up
she
wants
a
and
your
very
best
your
most
splendid
work
nick
stared
not
caring
that
he
had
blushed
is
she
serious
ah
nick
serious
biddy
reasoned
tenderly
she
came
nearer
again
and
he
thought
her
again
about
to
weep
he
took
her
by
the
shoulders
looking
into
her
eyes
it
all
right
if
she
knows
am
but
why
does
she
come
like
any
one
else
i
do
refuse
people
nick
dearest
nick
she
went
on
her
eyes
conscious
and
pleading
he
looked
into
them
intently
as
well
as
she
could
he
play
at
sounding
and
for
a
moment
between
these
young
persons
the
air
was
lighted
by
the
glimmer
of
mutual
searchings
and
suppressed
confessions
nick
read
deep
and
then
suddenly
releasing
his
sister
turned
away
she
did
see
his
face
in
that
movement
but
an
observer
to
whom
it
had
been
presented
might
have
fancied
it
denoted
a
foreboding
that
was
not
exactly
a
dread
yet
was
not
exclusively
a
joy
the
first
thing
he
made
out
in
the
room
when
he
could
distinguish
was
gabriel
nash
portrait
which
suddenly
filled
him
with
an
unreasoning
rancour
he
seized
it
and
turned
it
about
jammed
it
back
into
its
corner
with
its
face
against
the
wall
this
small
diversion
might
have
served
to
carry
off
the
embarrassment
with
which
he
had
finally
averted
himself
from
biddy
the
embarrassment
however
was
all
his
own
none
of
it
was
reflected
in
the
way
she
resumed
after
a
silence
in
which
she
had
followed
his
disposal
of
the
picture
if
she
so
eager
to
come
here
for
it
here
she
wants
to
sit
not
in
great
stanhope
street
never
how
can
she
prove
better
that
she
care
a
bit
if
she
meets
miss
rooth
she
wo
meet
miss
rooth
nick
replied
rather
dryly
oh
i
sorry
said
biddy
she
was
as
frank
as
if
she
had
achieved
a
virtual
victory
and
seemed
to
regret
the
loss
of
a
chance
for
julia
to
show
an
equal
mildness
her
tone
made
her
brother
laugh
but
she
went
on
with
confidence
she
thought
it
was
nash
who
made
miss
rooth
come
so
he
did
by
the
way
said
nick
well
then
was
that
making
trouble
i
thought
you
admitted
there
was
no
harm
in
her
being
here
yes
but
hoped
there
be
poor
nash
hopes
nick
laughed
my
dear
child
it
would
take
a
cleverer
head
than
you
or
me
or
even
julia
who
must
have
invented
that
wise
theory
to
say
what
they
were
however
let
us
agree
that
even
if
they
were
perfectly
fiendish
my
good
sense
has
been
a
match
for
them
oh
nick
that
delightful
chanted
biddy
then
she
added
do
you
mean
she
does
come
any
more
the
dishevelled
actress
she
has
been
near
me
for
months
but
she
in
london
she
always
acting
i
been
away
so
much
scarcely
observed
biddy
explained
with
a
slight
change
of
note
the
same
silly
part
poor
creature
for
nearly
a
year
it
appears
that
that
in
her
profession
i
saw
her
in
the
character
several
times
last
summer
but
have
set
foot
in
her
theatre
since
biddy
took
this
in
then
she
suggested
peter
would
have
liked
that
oh
peter
likes
nick
at
his
easel
beginning
to
work
conveniently
sighed
i
mean
her
acting
the
same
part
for
a
year
i
sure
i
do
know
he
has
never
written
me
a
word
nor
me
either
biddy
returned
there
was
another
short
silence
during
which
nick
brushed
at
a
panel
it
ended
in
his
presently
saying
there
one
thing
certainly
peter
like
that
is
simply
to
be
here
it
a
great
night
another
great
night
for
the
abandoned
one
she
to
act
juliet
for
the
first
time
ah
how
i
should
like
to
see
her
the
girl
cried
nick
glanced
at
her
she
sat
watching
him
she
has
sent
me
a
stall
i
wish
she
had
sent
me
two
i
should
have
been
delighted
to
take
you
do
you
think
you
could
get
another
biddy
quavered
they
must
be
in
tremendous
demand
but
who
knows
after
all
nick
added
at
the
same
moment
looking
round
here
a
chance
here
quite
an
extraordinary
chance
his
servant
had
opened
the
door
and
was
ushering
in
a
lady
whose
identity
was
indeed
justly
reflected
in
those
words
miss
rooth
the
man
announced
but
he
was
caught
up
by
a
gentleman
who
came
next
and
who
exclaimed
laughing
and
with
a
gesture
gracefully
corrective
no
no
no
longer
miss
rooth
miriam
entered
the
place
with
her
charming
familiar
grandeur
entered
very
much
as
she
might
have
appeared
as
she
appeared
every
night
early
in
her
first
act
at
the
back
of
the
stage
by
the
immemorial
middle
door
she
might
exactly
now
have
been
presenting
herself
to
the
house
taking
easy
possession
repeating
old
movements
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
actors
before
the
footlights
the
rich
she
threw
into
the
air
holding
out
her
right
hand
to
biddy
and
then
giving
her
left
to
nick
as
she
might
have
given
it
to
her
own
brother
had
nothing
to
tell
of
intervals
or
alienations
she
struck
biddy
as
still
more
terrible
in
her
splendid
practice
than
when
she
had
seen
her
before
the
practice
and
the
splendour
had
now
something
almost
royal
the
girl
had
had
occasion
to
make
her
curtsey
to
majesties
and
highnesses
but
the
flutter
those
effigies
produced
was
nothing
to
the
way
in
which
at
the
approach
of
this
young
lady
the
agitated
air
seemed
to
recognise
something
supreme
so
the
deep
mild
eyes
she
bent
on
biddy
were
not
soothing
though
for
that
matter
evidently
intended
to
soothe
biddy
wondered
nick
could
have
got
so
used
to
her
he
joked
at
her
as
she
loomed
and
later
in
the
day
still
under
the
great
impression
of
this
incident
she
even
wondered
that
peter
could
have
full
an
impunity
it
was
true
that
peter
apparently
did
quite
feel
one
you
never
came
you
never
came
miriam
said
to
her
kindly
and
sadly
and
biddy
recognising
the
allusion
the
invitation
to
visit
the
actress
at
home
had
to
explain
how
much
she
had
been
absent
from
london
and
then
even
that
her
brother
had
proposed
to
take
her
very
true
he
has
come
himself
what
he
doing
now
asked
miss
rooth
standing
near
her
young
friend
but
looking
at
nick
who
had
immediately
engaged
in
conversation
with
his
other
visitor
a
gentleman
whose
face
came
back
to
the
girl
she
had
seen
this
gentleman
on
the
stage
with
the
great
performer
that
was
it
the
night
peter
took
her
to
the
theatre
with
florry
tressilian
oh
that
nick
would
only
do
something
of
that
sort
now
this
desire
quickened
by
the
presence
of
the
strange
expressive
woman
by
the
way
she
scattered
sweet
syllables
as
if
she
were
touching
the
combined
with
other
things
to
make
our
young
lady
head
swim
other
things
too
mingled
to
name
admiration
and
fear
and
dim
divination
and
purposeless
pride
and
curiosity
and
resistance
the
impulse
to
go
away
and
the
determination
to
as
she
would
have
liked
fondly
to
fancy
it
hold
her
ground
the
actress
courted
her
with
a
wondrous
voice
what
was
the
matter
with
the
actress
and
what
did
she
want
and
biddy
tried
in
return
to
give
an
idea
of
what
nick
was
doing
not
succeeding
very
well
she
was
about
to
appeal
to
her
brother
but
miriam
stopped
her
with
the
remark
that
it
signify
besides
dashwood
was
telling
nick
something
something
they
wanted
him
to
know
we
in
a
great
excitement
he
has
taken
a
theatre
miriam
added
taken
a
theatre
biddy
was
vague
we
going
to
set
up
for
ourselves
he
going
to
do
for
me
altogether
it
has
all
been
arranged
only
within
a
day
or
two
it
remains
to
be
seen
how
it
will
answer
miriam
smiled
biddy
murmured
some
friendly
hope
and
the
shining
presence
went
on
do
you
know
why
i
broken
in
here
after
a
long
absence
interrupting
your
poor
brother
so
basely
taking
up
his
precious
time
it
because
i
so
nervous
about
your
first
night
biddy
risked
do
you
know
about
that
are
you
coming
miriam

only
if
i
do
you
know
mind

positively

she
sounded
it
as
the
highest
of
favours
resting
her
hand
on
biddy
do
be
afraid
and
may
i
bring
a
friend
the
friend
with
whom
staying
miriam
now
just
gloomed
do
you
mean
mrs
dallow
no
no
miss
tressilian
she
puts
me
up
she
has
got
a
flat
did
you
ever
see
a
flat
asked
biddy
expansively
my
cousin
not
in
london
miriam
replied
that
she
might
bring
whom
she
liked
and
biddy
broke
out
to
her
brother
fancy
what
kindness
nick
we
to
have
a
box
and
you
to
take
me
nick
turned
to
her
a
face
of
levity
which
struck
her
even
at
the
time
as
too
cynically
free
but
which
she
understood
when
the
finer
sense
of
it
subsequently
recurred
to
her
dashwood
interposed
with
the
remark
that
it
was
all
very
well
to
talk
about
boxes
but
that
he
did
see
how
at
that
time
of
day
the
miracle
was
to
be
worked
you
have
kept
one
as
i
told
you
miriam
demanded
as
you
told
me
my
dear
tell
the
lamb
to
keep
its
tenderest
mutton
from
the
wolves
you
shall
have
one
we
arrange
it
miriam
went
on
to
biddy
let
me
qualify
that
statement
a
little
miss
dormer
said
basil
dashwood
we
arrange
it
if
it
humanly
possible
we
arrange
it
even
if
it
inhumanly
that
just
the
point
miriam
declared
to
the
girl
do
talk
about
trouble
he
meant
for
but
to
take
it
you
see
she
continued
to
nick
does
it
look
as
if
we
should
pull
beautifully
together
and
as
he
answered
that
he
heartily
congratulated
her
he
was
immensely
interested
in
what
he
had
been
told
she
exclaimed
after
resting
her
eyes
on
him
a
moment
what
will
you
have
it
seemed
simpler
it
was
clear
there
had
to
be
some
one
she
explained
further
to
nick
what
had
led
her
to
come
in
at
that
moment
while
dashwood
approached
biddy
with
a
civil
assurance
that
they
would
see
they
would
leave
no
stone
unturned
though
he
would
not
have
taken
upon
himself
to
promise
miriam
reminded
nick
of
the
blessing
he
had
been
to
her
nearly
a
year
before
on
her
other
first
night
when
she
was
all
impatient
and
on
edge
how
he
had
let
her
come
and
sit
there
for
hours
helped
her
to
possess
her
soul
till
the
evening
and
to
keep
out
of
harm
way
the
case
was
the
same
at
present
with
the
aggravation
indeed
that
he
would
understand
dashwood
nerves
as
well
as
her
own
dashwood
were
a
great
deal
worse
than
hers
everything
was
ready
for
juliet
they
had
been
rehearsing
for
five
months
it
had
kept
her
from
going
mad
from
the
treadmill
of
the
other
piece
and
he
nick
had
occurred
to
her
again
in
the
last
intolerable
hours
as
the
friend
in
need
the
salutary
no
matter
how
much
she
worried
him
she
should
be
turned
out
biddy
broke
away
from
basil
dashwood
she
must
go
she
must
hurry
off
to
miss
tressilian
with
her
news
florry
might
make
some
other
stupid
engagement
for
the
evening
she
must
be
warned
in
time
the
girl
took
a
flushed
excited
leave
after
having
received
a
renewal
of
miriam
pledge
and
even
heard
her
say
to
nick
that
he
must
now
give
back
the
seat
already
sent
him
they
should
be
sure
to
have
another
use
for
it
li
that
night
at
the
theatre
and
in
the
box
the
miracle
had
been
wrought
the
treasure
found
nick
dormer
pointed
out
to
his
two
companions
the
stall
he
had
relinquished
which
was
close
in
front
noting
how
oddly
it
remained
during
the
whole
of
the
first
act
vacant
the
house
was
beyond
everything
the
actress
beyond
any
one
though
to
describe
again
so
famous
an
occasion
it
has
been
described
repeatedly
by
other
reporters
is
not
in
the
compass
of
the
closing
words
of
a
history
already
too
sustained
it
is
enough
to
say
that
these
great
hours
marked
an
era
in
contemporary
art
and
that
for
those
who
had
a
share
in
them
the
words
revelation
incarnation
acclamation
demonstration
ovation
to
name
only
a
few
and
all
accompanied
by
the
word
extraordinary
acquired
a
new
force
miriam
juliet
was
an
exquisite
image
of
young
passion
and
young
despair
expressed
in
the
truest
divinest
music
that
had
ever
poured
from
tragic
lips
the
great
childish
audience
gaping
at
her
points
expanded
there
before
her
like
a
lap
to
catch
flowers
during
the
first
interval
our
three
friends
in
the
box
had
plenty
to
talk
about
and
they
were
so
occupied
with
it
that
for
some
time
they
failed
to
observe
a
gentleman
who
had
at
last
come
into
the
empty
stall
near
the
front
this
discovery
was
presently
formulated
by
miss
tressilian
in
the
cheerful
exclamation
only
fancy
there
mr
sherringham
this
of
course
immediately
became
a
high
wonder
a
wonder
for
nick
and
biddy
who
had
not
heard
of
his
return
and
the
prodigy
was
quickened
by
the
fact
that
he
gave
no
sign
of
looking
for
them
or
even
at
them
having
taken
possession
of
his
place
he
sat
very
still
in
it
staring
straight
before
him
at
the
curtain
his
abrupt
reappearance
held
the
seeds
of
anxiety
both
for
biddy
and
for
nick
so
that
it
was
mainly
miss
tressilian
who
had
freedom
of
mind
to
throw
off
the
theory
that
he
had
come
back
that
very
hour
had
arrived
from
a
long
journey
they
see
how
strange
he
was
and
how
brown
how
burnt
and
how
red
how
tired
and
how
worn
they
all
inspected
him
though
biddy
declined
miss
tressilian
glass
but
he
was
evidently
indifferent
to
notice
and
finally
biddy
leaning
back
in
her
chair
dropped
the
fantastic
words
he
has
come
home
to
marry
juliet
nick
glanced
at
her
and
then
replied
what
a
disaster
to
make
such
a
journey
as
that
and
to
be
late
for
the
fair
late
for
the
fair
why
she
married
these
three
days
they
did
it
very
quietly
miriam
says
because
her
mother
hated
it
and
hopes
it
wo
be
much
known
all
the
same
she
basil
dashwood
wedded
wife
he
has
come
in
just
in
time
to
take
the
receipts
for
juliet
it
a
good
thing
no
doubt
for
there
are
at
least
two
fortunes
to
be
made
out
of
her
and
he
give
up
the
stage
nick
explained
to
miss
tressilian
who
had
inquired
that
the
gentleman
in
question
was
the
actor
who
was
playing
mercutio
and
he
asked
biddy
if
she
had
known
that
this
was
what
they
were
telling
him
in
rosedale
road
that
morning
she
replied
that
she
had
understood
nothing
but
that
she
was
to
be
where
she
was
and
she
sank
considerably
behind
the
drapery
of
the
box
from
this
cover
she
was
able
to
launch
creditably
enough
the
exclamation
poor
poor
peter
nick
got
up
and
stood
looking
at
poor
poor
peter
he
ought
to
come
round
and
speak
to
us
but
if
he
does
see
us
i
suppose
he
does
he
quitted
the
box
as
to
go
to
the
restored
exile
and
i
may
add
that
as
soon
as
he
had
done
so
florence
tressilian
bounded
over
to
the
dusk
in
which
biddy
had
nestled
what
passed
immediately
between
these
young
ladies
need
concern
us
it
is
sufficient
to
mention
that
two
minutes
later
miss
tressilian
broke
out
look
at
him
dearest
he
turning
his
head
this
way
thank
you
i
do
care
to
watch
his
turns
said
biddy
and
she
doubtless
demeaned
herself
in
the
high
spirit
of
these
words
it
nevertheless
happened
that
directly
afterwards
she
had
certain
knowledge
of
his
having
glanced
at
his
watch
as
if
to
judge
how
soon
the
curtain
would
rise
again
as
well
as
of
his
having
then
jumped
up
and
passed
quickly
out
of
his
place
the
curtain
had
risen
again
without
his
reappearing
and
without
nick
returning
indeed
by
the
time
nick
slipped
in
a
good
deal
of
the
third
act
was
over
and
even
then
even
when
the
curtain
descended
peter
had
not
come
back
nick
sat
down
in
silence
to
watch
the
stage
to
which
the
breathless
attention
of
his
companions
seemed
attached
though
biddy
after
a
moment
threw
round
at
him
a
single
quick
look
at
the
end
of
the
act
they
were
all
occupied
with
the
recalls
the
applause
and
the
responsive
loveliness
of
juliet
as
she
was
led
out
mercutio
had
to
give
her
up
to
romeo
and
even
for
a
few
minutes
after
the
deafening
roar
had
subsided
nothing
was
said
among
the
three
at
last
nick
began
it
quite
true
he
has
just
arrived
he
in
great
stanhope
street
they
given
him
several
weeks
to
make
up
for
the
uncomfortable
way
they
bundled
him
off
to
get
there
in
time
for
some
special
business
that
had
suddenly
to
be
gone
into
when
he
first
went
out
he
tells
me
they
even
then
promised
that
he
got
into
southampton
only
a
few
hours
ago
rushed
up
by
the
first
train
he
could
catch
and
came
off
here
without
any
dinner
fancy
said
miss
tressilian
while
biddy
more
generally
asked
if
peter
might
be
in
good
health
and
appeared
to
have
been
happy
nick
replied
that
he
described
his
post
as
beastly
but
did
seem
to
have
suffered
from
it
he
was
to
be
in
england
probably
a
month
he
was
awfully
brown
he
sent
his
love
to
biddy
miss
tressilian
looked
at
his
empty
stall
and
was
of
the
opinion
that
it
would
be
more
to
the
point
if
he
were
to
come
in
to
see
her
oh
he
turn
up
we
had
a
goodish
talk
in
the
lobby
where
he
met
me
i
think
he
went
out
somewhere
how
odd
to
come
so
many
thousand
miles
for
this
and
then
not
to
stay
biddy
fluted
did
he
come
on
purpose
for
this
miss
tressilian
asked
perhaps
he
gone
out
to
get
his
dinner
joked
biddy
her
friend
suggested
that
he
might
be
behind
the
scenes
but
nick
cast
doubts
whereupon
biddy
asked
if
he
himself
were
not
going
round
at
this
moment
the
curtain
rose
nick
said
he
would
go
in
the
next
interval
as
soon
as
it
came
he
quitted
the
box
remaining
absent
while
it
lasted
all
this
time
in
the
house
there
was
no
sign
of
peter
nick
reappeared
only
as
the
fourth
act
was
beginning
and
uttered
no
word
to
his
companions
till
it
was
over
then
after
a
further
delay
produced
by
renewed
vociferous
proofs
of
the
personal
victory
won
he
depicted
his
visit
to
the
stage
and
the
wonderful
sight
of
miriam
on
the
field
of
battle
miss
tressilian
inquired
if
he
had
found
sherringham
with
her
to
which
he
replied
that
save
across
the
footlights
she
had
not
been
in
touch
with
him
at
this
a
soft
exclamation
broke
from
biddy
poor
peter
where
is
he
then
nick
seemed
to
falter
he
walking
the
streets
walking
the
streets
i
do
know
i
give
it
up
our
young
man
replied
and
his
tone
for
some
minutes
reduced
his
companions
to
silence
but
a
little
later
biddy
said
was
it
for
him
this
morning
she
wanted
that
place
when
she
asked
you
to
give
yours
back
for
him
exactly
it
very
odd
she
had
just
managed
to
keep
it
for
all
the
good
use
he
makes
of
it
she
told
me
just
now
that
she
heard
from
him
at
his
post
a
short
time
ago
to
the
effect
that
he
had
seen
in
a
newspaper
a
statement
she
was
going
to
do
juliet
and
that
he
firmly
intended
though
the
ways
and
means
were
not
clear
to
him
his
leave
of
absence
had
yet
come
out
and
he
could
be
sure
when
it
would
come
to
be
present
on
her
first
night
whereby
she
must
do
him
the
service
to
provide
him
a
place
she
thought
this
a
speech
rather
in
the
air
so
that
in
the
midst
of
all
her
cares
she
took
no
particular
pains
about
the
matter
she
had
an
idea
she
had
really
done
with
him
for
a
long
time
but
this
afternoon
what
does
he
do
but
telegraph
to
her
from
southampton
that
he
keeps
his
appointment
and
counts
on
her
for
a
stall
unless
she
had
got
back
mine
she
would
have
been
able
to
help
him
when
she
was
in
rosedale
road
this
morning
she
had
received
his
telegram
but
his
promise
his
threat
whatever
it
was
came
back
to
her
she
had
a
vague
foreboding
and
thought
that
on
the
chance
she
had
better
hold
something
ready
when
she
got
home
she
found
his
telegram
and
she
told
me
he
was
the
first
person
she
saw
in
the
house
through
her
fright
when
she
came
on
in
the
second
act
it
appears
she
was
terrified
this
time
and
it
lasted
half
through
the
play
she
must
be
rather
annoyed
at
his
having
gone
away
miss
tressilian
observed
annoyed
i
not
so
sure
laughed
nick
ah
here
he
comes
back
cried
biddy
behind
her
fan
while
the
absentee
edged
into
his
seat
in
time
for
the
fifth
act
he
stood
there
a
moment
first
looking
round
the
theatre
then
he
turned
his
eyes
to
the
box
occupied
by
his
relatives
smiling
and
waving
his
hand
after
that
he
surely
come
and
see
you
said
miss
tressilian
we
shall
see
him
as
we
go
out
biddy
returned
he
must
lose
no
more
time
nick
looked
at
him
with
a
glass
then
exclaiming
well
i
glad
he
has
pulled
himself
together
why
what
the
matter
with
him
if
he
was
disappointed
of
his
seat
miss
tressilian
demanded
the
matter
with
him
is
that
a
couple
of
hours
ago
he
had
a
great
shock
a
great
shock
i
may
as
well
mention
it
at
last
nick
went
on
i
had
to
say
something
to
him
in
the
lobby
there
when
we
met
something
i
was
pretty
sure
he
could
like
i
let
him
have
it
full
in
the
face
it
seemed
to
me
better
and
wiser
i
let
him
know
that
juliet
married
did
he
know
it
asked
biddy
who
with
her
face
raised
had
listened
in
deep
stillness
to
every
word
that
fell
from
her
brother
how
should
he
have
known
it
it
has
only
just
taken
place
and
been
so
clever
for
reasons
of
their
own
those
people
move
among
a
lot
of
considerations
that
are
absolutely
foreign
to
us
about
keeping
it
out
of
the
papers
they
put
in
a
lot
of
lies
and
they
leave
out
the
real
things
you
do
mean
to
say
sherringham
wanted
to
her
miss
tressilian
gasped
do
ask
me
what
he
wanted
i
daresay
we
shall
never
know
one
very
certain
that
he
did
like
my
news
dear
old
peter
and
that
i
sha
soon
forget
the
look
in
his
face
as
he
turned
away
from
me
and
slipped
out
into
the
street
he
was
too
much
upset
he
could
trust
himself
to
come
back
he
had
to
walk
about
he
tried
to
walk
it
off
let
us
hope
then
he
walked
it
off
ah
poor
fellow
he
could
hold
out
to
the
end
he
has
had
to
come
back
and
look
at
her
once
more
he
knows
she
be
sublime
in
these
last
scenes
is
he
so
much
in
love
with
her
as
that
what
difference
does
it
make
for
an
actress
if
she
mar
but
in
this
rash
inquiry
miss
tressilian
suddenly
checked
herself
we
shall
probably
never
know
how
much
he
has
been
in
love
with
her
nor
what
difference
it
makes
we
shall
never
know
exactly
what
he
came
back
for
nor
why
he
could
stand
it
out
there
any
longer
without
relief
nor
why
he
scrambled
down
here
all
but
straight
from
the
station
nor
why
after
all
for
the
last
two
hours
he
has
been
roaming
the
streets
and
it
does
matter
for
it
none
of
our
business
but
i
sorry
for
him
she
is
going
to
be
sublime
nick
added
the
curtain
was
rising
on
the
tragic
climax
of
the
play
miriam
rooth
was
sublime
yet
it
may
be
confided
to
the
reader
that
during
these
supreme
scenes
bridget
dormer
directed
her
eyes
less
to
the
inspired
actress
than
to
a
figure
in
the
stalls
who
sat
with
his
own
gaze
fastened
to
the
stage
it
may
further
be
intimated
that
peter
sherringham
though
he
saw
but
a
fragment
of
the
performance
read
clear
at
the
last
in
the
intense
light
of
genius
with
which
this
fragment
was
charged
that
even
so
after
all
he
had
been
rewarded
for
his
formidable
journey
the
great
trouble
of
his
infatuation
subsided
leaving
behind
it
something
appreciably
deep
and
pure
this
pacification
was
far
from
taking
place
at
once
but
it
was
helped
on
unexpectedly
to
him
it
began
to
work
at
least
the
very
next
night
he
saw
the
play
through
the
whole
of
which
he
then
sat
he
felt
somehow
recalled
to
the
real
by
the
very
felicity
of
this
experience
the
supreme
exhibition
itself
he
began
to
come
back
as
from
a
province
of
his
history
where
miserable
madness
had
reigned
he
had
been
baffled
he
had
got
his
answer
it
must
last
him
that
was
plain
he
did
fully
accept
it
the
first
week
or
the
second
but
he
accepted
it
sooner
than
he
could
have
supposed
had
he
known
what
it
was
to
be
when
he
paced
at
night
under
the
southern
stars
the
deck
of
the
ship
bearing
him
to
england
it
had
been
as
we
know
miss
tressilian
view
and
even
biddy
that
evening
that
peter
sherringham
would
join
them
as
they
left
the
theatre
this
view
however
was
not
confirmed
by
the
event
for
our
troubled
gentleman
vanished
utterly
disappointingly
crude
behaviour
on
the
part
of
a
young
diplomatist
who
had
distinguished
himself
before
any
one
could
put
a
hand
on
him
and
he
failed
to
make
up
for
his
crudity
by
coming
to
see
any
one
the
next
day
or
even
the
next
indeed
many
days
elapsed
and
very
little
would
have
been
known
about
him
had
it
not
been
that
in
the
country
dallow
knew
what
dallow
knew
was
eventually
known
to
biddy
dormer
and
in
this
way
it
could
be
established
in
his
favour
that
he
had
remained
some
extraordinarily
small
number
of
days
in
london
had
almost
directly
gone
over
to
paris
to
see
his
old
chief
he
came
back
from
paris
biddy
learnt
this
not
from
julia
but
in
a
much
more
immediate
way
she
knew
it
by
his
pressing
the
little
electric
button
at
the
door
of
florence
flat
one
day
when
the
good
florence
was
out
and
she
herself
was
at
home
he
made
on
this
occasion
a
very
long
visit
the
good
florence
knew
it
not
much
later
you
may
be
sure
and
how
he
had
got
their
address
from
nick
and
she
took
an
extravagant
pleasure
in
it
sherringham
had
never
been
to
see
the
like
of
her
in
his
life
therefore
it
was
clear
what
had
made
him
begin
when
he
had
once
begun
he
kept
it
up
and
miss
tressilian
pleasure
grew
good
as
she
was
she
could
remember
without
the
slightest
relenting
what
nick
dormer
had
repeated
to
them
at
the
theatre
about
the
dreary
side
of
peter
present
post
however
she
was
not
bound
to
make
a
stand
at
this
if
persons
more
nearly
concerned
lady
agnes
and
the
girl
herself
did
mind
it
how
little
minded
it
and
grace
and
julia
dallow
and
even
nick
was
proved
in
the
course
of
a
meeting
that
took
place
at
harsh
during
the
easter
holidays
the
mistress
of
that
seat
had
a
small
and
intimate
party
to
celebrate
her
brother
betrothal
the
two
ladies
came
over
from
broadwood
even
nick
for
two
days
went
back
to
his
old
and
miss
tressilian
relinquished
for
as
long
a
time
the
delights
of
her
newly
arranged
flat
peter
sherringham
obtained
an
extension
of
leave
so
that
he
might
go
back
to
his
legation
with
a
wife
fortunately
as
it
turned
out
biddy
ordeal
in
the
more
or
less
torrid
zone
was
not
cruelly
prolonged
for
the
pair
have
already
received
a
superior
appointment
it
is
lady
agnes
proud
opinion
that
her
daughter
is
even
now
shaping
their
destiny
i
say
even
now
for
these
facts
bring
me
very
close
to
contemporary
history
during
those
two
days
at
harsh
nick
arranged
with
the
former
mistress
of
his
fate
the
conditions
as
they
might
be
called
under
which
she
should
sit
to
him
and
every
one
will
remember
in
how
recent
an
exhibition
general
attention
was
attracted
as
the
newspapers
said
in
describing
the
private
view
to
the
noble
portrait
of
a
lady
which
was
the
final
outcome
of
that
arrangement
gabriel
nash
had
been
at
many
a
private
view
but
he
was
not
at
that
one
these
matters
are
highly
recent
however
as
i
say
so
that
in
glancing
about
the
little
circle
of
the
interests
i
have
tried
to
evoke
i
am
suddenly
warned
by
a
sharp
sense
of
modernness
this
renders
it
difficult
to
me
for
instance
in
taking
leave
of
our
wonderful
miriam
to
do
much
more
than
allude
to
the
general
impression
that
her
remarkable
career
is
even
yet
only
in
its
early
prime
basil
dashwood
has
got
his
theatre
and
his
wife
people
know
now
she
his
wife
has
added
three
or
four
new
parts
to
her
repertory
but
every
one
is
agreed
that
both
in
public
and
in
private
she
has
a
great
deal
more
to
show
this
is
equally
true
of
nick
dormer
in
regard
to
whom
i
may
finally
say
that
his
friend
nash
predictions
about
his
reunion
with
dallow
have
not
up
to
this
time
been
justified
on
the
other
hand
i
must
not
omit
to
add
this
lady
has
not
at
the
latest
accounts
married
macgeorge
it
is
very
true
there
has
been
a
rumour
that
macgeorge
is
worried
about
her
has
even
ceased
at
all
fondly
to
believe
in
her
